[00:07:00] <pokergod> Cork, if file.val() is unreliable, what's the preferred method?
[00:07:17] <Cork> pokergod: it isn't unreliable, it isn't meant to be used
[00:07:25] <Cork> pokergod: firstly what are you trying to do?
[00:07:33] <pokergod> get the filename that was uploaded
[00:07:58] <Cork> AFTER a http post??
[00:08:20] <pokergod> ajax posting the file
[00:08:24] <Cork> ah
[00:08:42] <Cork> are you processing the files you're self or are you depending on a lib for that?
[00:08:53] <pokergod> blueimp
[00:09:30] <Cork> js> print("yes")
[00:09:37] <Cork> hmm
[00:10:01] <Cork> pokergod: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications
[00:10:17] <Cork> the file object has a name, that is what you're after
[00:10:55] <Cork> File requires ie10+
[00:11:11] <Cork> but you can't reliably work with files in js without the Files object
[00:23:53] <spexi> Hi! I have created a menu, that consists of div elements. There are five div elements as main menu links, and between them are hidden sub-menus, which are divs too. When user clicks main menu link, there's a .toggle() for the for the submenu divs. It works like a charm in desktop browser.
[00:23:58] <spexi> But why it is so, that when browsing for example with stock Android browser, and doing lots of hiding / showing, some of the main menu divs just disappear? Looks like a rendering problem, but does anyone have a fix for it? Here's the menu only: http://spexi.kapsi.fi/test/
[02:13:11] <workerbeetwo> hi
[02:14:35] <workerbeetwo> $ is not a function   on    $(document).ready ...  . I dont understand why. it is a simple test.html .  <script src="jqeury.js"></script> is included.
[02:16:06] <Xatenev> jqeury
[02:16:13] <Xatenev> its jquery
[02:16:13] <Xatenev> :p
[02:16:30] <workerbeetwo> jquery yes. but that was a typon in here.
[02:16:37] <Xatenev> so why dont u copy the real code
[02:16:38] <workerbeetwo> *typo
[02:16:52] <Xatenev> how would we know what the problem is without showing the real code :)
[02:17:14] <Xatenev> check firebug / developer tools > network
[02:17:20] <Xatenev> and check if ur jquery.js is loaded with the righ tcontent
[02:17:32] <workerbeetwo> yes it is loaded.
[02:17:34] <workerbeetwo> <script src="jquery.js"></script>
[02:17:38] <Xatenev> u sure?
[02:17:44] <Xatenev> cause then it would work
[02:17:45] <Xatenev> :P
[02:17:54] <Xatenev> can u make a jsfiddle?
[02:17:55] <workerbeetwo> yes. I can see the code in firebug.
[02:18:14] <Xatenev> then ur using $ before u load the script
[02:18:20] <arc_> that's what i was about to say
[02:18:22] <Xatenev> or try jQuery instead of $
[02:18:27] <andrew9184> sounds like wordpress
[02:18:37] <arc_> ya that's also possible
[02:18:44] <Xatenev> tho he said its just a simple test.html ^^
[02:18:47] <Xatenev> dont think $ is overwritten there ;:P
[02:18:55] <Xatenev> but without code or screenshots we can just guess :P
[02:19:13] <workerbeetwo> fiddle : https://jsfiddle.net/2yyw0w58/
[02:19:28] <arc_> : (
[02:21:06] <Xatenev> workerbeetwo: can u make a screenshot of the firebug and the network tab with the jquery.js?^^
[02:21:10] <Xatenev> I dont believe u xD
[02:21:20] <Xatenev> cause that should work I think..
[02:28:24] <workerbeetwo> Xatenev: http://snag.gy/HvLE9.jpg http://snag.gy/6lcSA.jpg
[02:29:54] <prohobo> um
[02:30:00] <prohobo> okay where is "<script src="jquery.js"></script>"
[02:30:12] <prohobo> jquery.js is in the root folder?
[02:30:30] <arc_> it must be. it's getting loaded
[02:30:53] <arc_> where did that jquery.js come from is my question
[02:31:43] <workerbeetwo> yes just at the side of this test.html .  it is right in the head section above my code. <script src="jquery.js"></script>
[02:31:59] <workerbeetwo> and as you can see. it really loads the jquery code.
[02:32:13] <prohobo> try a different version of jquery
[02:32:24] <prohobo> might be some kind of fake version o_o
[02:32:29] <prohobo> with no $
[02:33:01] <arc_> just load it from one of the normal urls
[02:33:39] <prohobo> wait
[02:33:40] <workerbeetwo> in deed jQuery v1.10.2   worked.
[02:33:45] <prohobo> ah
[02:33:48] <prohobo> weird
[02:34:45] <arc_> where did you get the version you were using
[02:36:56] <DanielCEd> Get guys , i got var allElements = thirdDIV.add(firstDIV).add(secondDIV); allElements.off(); allElements.on("click",".test",function(){ console.log(1) }); this run every time i click on .test, the things is that every time click on test it its not removing the old event listener from some reason so first click i got output 1, second i got that x2 and so on...
[02:37:03] <DanielCEd> anyone can give me a clue about the issue
[02:38:20] <workerbeetwo> arc_: heritage from former pages . perhaps those were edited.
[02:38:35] <arc_> i see
[02:40:22] <DanielCEd> mayne i should do allElements.find(*).off()
[02:40:34] <DanielCEd> but i guess thats expensive
[02:43:17] <questionMode> Hi everyone
[02:43:40] <questionMode> Anyone open to answer a question?
[02:43:42] <arc_> DanielCEd what is .test? i assume it's the class of those divs?
[02:44:25] <questionMode> I just noticed that the each loop stops when it the object is undefined
[02:44:29] <arc_> we need more information
[02:46:25] <questionMode> anybody>?
[02:46:55] <arc_> need more information
[02:47:09] <arc_> preferably to see your code
[02:47:15] <arc_> and not just a tiny part of it
[02:47:58] <prohobo> questionMode: lol
[02:48:06] <questionMode> :D
[02:48:09] <DanielCEd> arc_ yes
[02:48:28] <DanielCEd> this is a LESS expensive way to do allElements.find(*).off() ?
[02:48:35] <DanielCEd> maybe thats the MAIN question
[02:49:23] <arc_> in the code you showed, there is no event firing that runs the code that adds divs
[02:50:15] <arc_> why can't you just do $('.test').off();
[03:00:43] <questionMode> so here is an example
[03:00:44] <questionMode> https://jsfiddle.net/x8qop7g9/
[03:01:06] <questionMode> can someone please enlighten me why it breaks the loop when the object is undefined?
[03:04:21] <questionMode> @arc_ ?
[03:08:20] <questionMode> ?
[03:12:57] <questionMode> Can someone enlighten me pls why each loop breaks when an object is undefined (https://jsfiddle.net/x8qop7g9/).
[03:14:57] <dimi1947> is it OK you think that an element has two classes...ex class="a" class="b"?
[03:15:47] <dimi1947> I try to add a second class...like the example shown above but it is not shown in the markup
[03:17:10] <arc_> just do class="a b"
[03:17:41] <arc_> guess questionmode left
[03:20:28] <arc_> dimi1947 did you get that
[03:25:46] <hellyeah> hey
[03:26:30] <hellyeah> i have modal window implemented after clicking butto it appear but if i close it and reopen it again. Position of modal window change how can i avoid that? https://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/152/
[03:26:32] <dimi1947> ok...
[03:27:12] <dimi1947> and if want to target it... $('.a b').css('display','none');..is this the way?
[03:27:25] <prohobo> hellyeah: i dont see any difference
[03:27:27] <prohobo> seems fine to me
[03:27:53] <cannap> same here
[03:27:57] <hellyeah> in my web site the position changes
[03:28:04] <arc_> dimi1947 no, $('.a .b')
[03:28:14] <hellyeah> may be it is because of browser
[03:28:25] <hellyeah> how can i put modal boxes to the top of the page
[03:28:30] <cannap> z-index
[03:28:31] <cannap> absolute
[03:28:45] <hellyeah> actually i have margin:0; padding:0 but it didnt work as i expected
[03:28:53] <dimi1947> ok arc...give me a second to test
[03:28:59] <hellyeah> cannap:  jquery dont allow to use position:absolute;
[03:29:05] <cannap> what
[03:29:07] <hellyeah> z-index:999; ?
[03:29:13] <arc_> o_o;
[03:29:16] <cannap> z-index: the value you need;
[03:29:27] <cannap> dont know you z-index values
[03:29:59] <hellyeah> cannap:  Uncaught ReferenceError: absolute is not defined
[03:30:00] <cannap> for this you dont need jquery i think
[03:30:06] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/153/
[03:30:23] <hellyeah> it wont accept this
[03:30:27] <cannap> yes
[03:30:29] <dimi1947> arc...you are right thanks
[03:30:30] <cannap> absolute 'absolute'
[03:30:30] <arc_> hellyeah sounds like you did .css('position', absolute) when you need .css('position', 'absolute')
[03:30:40] <cannap> position:'absolute'
[03:30:46] <cannap> will work 100%
[03:30:50] <arc_> dimi1947 yw
[03:30:52] <hellyeah> '
[03:30:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:31:09] <hellyeah> i guess i forgot quatation
[03:31:17] <cannap> yes its a string
[03:31:20] <hellyeah> how can i understand what z-index value i need
[03:31:31] <arc_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index
[03:31:37] <cannap> have other divs z-index? then you need this
[03:31:56] <hellyeah> i dont have any z-index
[03:32:02] <hellyeah> but i have a button probably
[03:32:13] <hellyeah> i couldnt put modal window to the top of page
[03:32:23] <cannap> top:0;
[03:32:24] <hellyeah> because there is already button there actually i hide it
[03:32:28] <hellyeah> but still there
[03:32:29] <hellyeah> right
[03:33:19] <hellyeah> anyway let me think
[03:37:42] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:38:17] <hellyeah> second modal windows appears under first modal window i expect o see second modal window on the first modal window how can i achieve that? https://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/156/
[03:44:17] <prohobo> hellyeah: z-index
[03:45:15] <Cork> hellyeah: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-moveToTop
[03:45:44] <Cork> dialog has a built in reference for z-index you need to update it
[03:45:56] <hellyeah> prohobo:  talking about this https://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/158/
[03:46:15] <hellyeah> Cork:  let me check
[03:58:42] <parveen> i want to fire trigger on all select box having same class name
[03:58:55] <parveen> how can i do that?
[03:58:59] <samons> hi
[03:59:07] <Cork> fire "trigger" meaning?
[03:59:34] <parveen> $( SOMETHING HERE).trigger("change");
[03:59:52] <samons> how to call hover on ajax generated div?
[04:00:42] <cannap> .on
[04:01:07] <samons> i tried not works
[04:01:12] <cannap> show
[04:01:42] <samons> original js code $("a.quote").hover(function () {
[04:02:04] <cannap> no i mean
[04:02:08] <samons> after change to on it didn't send ajax call :
[04:02:13] <parveen> samons  it will work like this  -   $(document).on("hover", "a.quote", function() { });
[04:02:31] <cannap> $(document).on('hover','.thediv', function() {})
[04:02:45] <samons> okay trying
[04:02:54] <cannap> or via mouseenter and mouseleave
[04:03:43] <samons> parveen no ajax call send :(
[04:04:11] <parveen> any error in console ?
[04:04:13] <hellyeah> do i need to reset modal window?
[04:04:22] <parveen> because i am using this , and its working fine
[04:04:43] <samons> parveen no error
[04:04:43] <hellyeah> do you know this? I want to colorize the table like ligher red and darker red. Button will have both color in some period can i do that with css? or jquery?
[04:06:29] <samons> parveen any other suggestion?
[04:08:21] <hellyeah> http://codepen.io/bootstrapbay/pen/kCyBG like that but color will change in some period of time
[04:09:07] <Meir`> Cork, what's the best approach to post with ajax a custom value together with a serialized array?
[04:09:18] <parveen> samons , not now , actually it should work and i worked on it many time
[04:09:28] <Cork> serializeArray and append them to the resulting array
[04:09:43] <Meir`> with push?
[04:09:48] <Cork> yes
[04:10:36] <Meir`> actually, it's a checkbox set
[04:10:48] <Meir`> so $('.display_city:checked').serialize() is enough?
[04:13:18] <samons> strange .mouseover,mouseenter does not show console.log ()
[04:27:32] <Meir`> Cork, i can't manage to make it as a real form posted data
[04:27:54] <Cork> Meir`: use serializeArray inspect the array you get back
[04:27:59] <Cork> and replicate the format it uses
[04:28:20] <Cork> (the format is { name:"", value:"" })
[04:28:58] <Meir`> oh
[04:29:07] <Meir`> i pushed { name: "value" }
[04:29:10] <Meir`> let me see
[04:32:48] <Meir`> Cork, ok, now the headers look proper, but still, it doesn't read the POST correctly in the server side
[04:33:04] <Meir`> and i can't debug anything there, it's an API
[04:33:25] <Cork> check the params string in the browsers network tab
[04:33:37] <Meir`> i did
[04:33:56] <Cork> if you've formated the array and objects correctly you should get the params string you expect
[04:34:31] <Meir`> http://kopy.io/kmC7R
[04:35:02] <Cork> Meir`: what's the value in name and value?
[04:35:09] <Meir`> that's the form data from chrome developer tools > network > headers
[04:35:37] <Meir`> $data = $('.display_city:checked').serializeArray(); $data.push({ name: "action", value: "saveCities" });
[04:36:07] <Meir`> and in server side should be something like if ($_POST("action"))
[04:36:20] <Meir`> looks like it doesn't enter this condition
[04:39:31] <Meir`> Cork, sorry, checked on github
[04:39:32] <Meir`> if (isset($_POST['action']))
[04:39:47] <goldfinger> is it better to set a cookin in jQuery or in JS ?
[04:39:49] <Meir`> although it's off topic here
[04:44:12] <Cork> Meir`: and what does the params string show in the network tab?
[04:45:27] <Meir`> yeah that's what i just investigated
[04:45:33] <Meir`> i probably should use $.param
[04:45:51] <Cork> Meir`: no
[04:46:01] <Cork> just check what the browser actually send
[04:47:55] <Meir`> it sends the "$data" as a POST element name
[04:48:16] <Cork> how are you giving the array to $.ajax?
[04:48:55] <Meir`> yeah
[04:48:59] <Cork> ?
[04:49:00] <Meir`> to the "data" param
[04:49:05] <Cork> HOW
[04:49:09] <Meir`> didn't see the "how"
[04:49:27] <Meir`> data: { $data } :D thanks
[04:49:30] <Meir`> data: $data
[04:49:31] <Meir`> right?
[04:49:47] <Cork> there you go
[04:49:53] <Cork> it should be the later one ya
[04:50:46] <Abhijit> will $("#next").html( add a div with id "next" on the page if it already do not exist?
[04:51:02] <Meir`> those small forgotten things +_+
[04:51:17] <Meir`> thanks Cork
[04:51:20] <Cork> np
[04:52:09] <Cork> Abhijit: it will add an element with the attribute id="next" but it won't be an id on the page
[04:52:22] <Cork> (as ids only can exist once)
[04:53:00] <Abhijit> Cork, I will add a variable to the name. My actual question is does this methed automatically adds a "new" div if that div already not written by me?
[04:53:35] <Cork> Abhijit: depends on what content you give it
[04:53:40] <Cork> if you give it a dom element, then no
[04:53:46] <Cork> if you give it a string with html, then ya
[04:53:58] <Abhijit> i am adding html5 video element inside it.
[04:53:58] <Cork> html always create new elements
[04:54:13] <Cork> Abhijit: element or html?
[04:54:17] <Cork> not the same thing
[04:54:17] <Abhijit> <video>
[04:54:22] <Cork> meaning?
[04:54:33] <Abhijit> its a tag to add video
[04:54:39] <Cork> soo... html?
[04:54:44] <Abhijit> yes
[04:54:53] <Cork> ok, then yes a new element will always be created
[04:54:57] <Abhijit> ok
[04:54:58] <Abhijit> thanks.
[04:55:43] <Uhkis> what happened to tias?
[04:56:11] <Cork> got out of fashion
[04:56:22] <Uhkis> we get a lot of questions which would be answered way faster by trying
[04:58:35] <Cork> but where's the fun in that
[05:06:34] <hellyeah> any asp.net user here
[05:06:36] <hellyeah> http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/534587/ASP-NET-jQuery-is-not-Working-in-UpdatePanels
[05:06:41] <hellyeah> this is suck as hell
[05:07:35] <Cork> hellyeah: is that a question or... what do you want us to do about it?
[05:08:00] <hellyeah> may be you knwo something about that updatepanel dont work with jquery function.
[05:08:17] <hellyeah> do you knw anything aboıut this? May be you used web forms
[05:08:17] <Cork> best would be to as the developers of "updatepanel"
[05:08:34] <Cork> *to ask_*
[05:51:51] <Nyterax> hi, anyone familiar with Columnizer plugin?
[05:53:43] <Nyterax> is it possible to make it update the object it uses for rebuilding columns onResize after I have made changes to it?
[05:56:31] <hep_> Hello. :)
[05:57:56] <hep_> I am having an issue that when I have a login form jqm seems to load the new page on top of the login form and not create a brand new page. The "data-url" is incorrect for the new loaded page. Any clues on this?
[06:01:09] <notchris> I have a project in which I have to do a lot of DOM manip.
[06:01:26] <notchris> Not my favorite thing to do, but it’s necessary
[06:01:30] <hep_> How do I get JQM to allow the new page to load as a new page and not part of the current page?
[06:01:42] <notchris> Does anyone have a good solution to prevent page flickers between load
[06:01:51] <notchris> Like, only showing a page once it is loaded
[06:03:05] <MikeD_> notchris: compose your manipulations in a fragment, add the fragment when all the other stuff is done
[06:03:29] <notchris> MikeD_: So if the page looks different before my DOM manipulation
[06:03:35] <notchris> I wont see the existing page?
[06:03:42] <MikeD_> of course you will
[06:03:42] <notchris> Prior to the DOM changes
[06:03:48] <notchris> That’s what I’m trying to prevent
[06:04:13] <MikeD_> so first copy the body into a fragment and replace it with a picture of a goat while you work
[06:04:14] <notchris> Like, maybe I set the main container’s CSS to display:none; and when JS is ready, change it to visible
[06:04:39] <MikeD_> you must be doing a helluva lot of DOM work to notice it at all
[06:04:47] <rubyronin> hep_: I have the same question
[06:05:37] <notchris> MikeD_: I am
[06:05:41] <notchris> But it’s necessary
[06:05:42] <notchris> Sadly
[06:05:54] <MikeD_> is it a public page?
[06:06:01] <rubyronin> hep_: think this will work? http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.1.1/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html
[06:06:02] <MikeD_> i'm curious to see it :)
[06:09:56] <rubyronin> hep_: http://www.gajotres.net/advanced-jquery-mobile-tutorial-part-3-dynamic-content/
[06:10:47] <rubyronin> hep_: http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/frSsS/
[06:11:33] <rubyronin> anyone experience problems with the width of your layout with jqm? My users can drag beyond the width of the screen
[06:11:36] <rubyronin> how do I fix this?
[06:19:44] <hep_> rubyronin: THanks, I am checking those out.
[06:31:41] <workerbeetwo> How to wait for a call to have finished before doing a dependent step? is there .done( myAfterwardsFunction ) ; ?
[06:33:51] <FilipNortic> http://jsfiddle.net/swy5uvng/1/  this counter works in firefox is of by a few in chorme. It often locks down before counter reaches zero. Tried to find a link but wasn't sure what to search for
[06:34:02] <FilipNortic> but is*
[06:34:47] <FilipNortic> is it a bug or method error?
[06:43:42] <Cork> workerbeetwo: dependent?
[06:43:56] <Cork> you mean something after an ajax call?
[06:44:58] <workerbeetwo> Cork: its not an ajax call but quite similar to it, Id like to call a function when another is done.
[06:45:22] <Cork> workerbeetwo: so you mean func1(); func2() ?
[06:45:32] <Cork> done is only needed for async code
[06:45:50] <Cork> FilipNortic: works just fine in chromium here
[06:46:51] <workerbeetwo> Cork: it might be asnych code. it is a black box to me. I just call that function and like to wait for it to be finished.
[06:47:09] <Cork> workerbeetwo: then you need to unblack that box
[06:47:37] <Cork> cause no there isn't a generic auto existence of an after async handlers for function
[06:47:44] <blinky_> Hi all, wondering if someone could help a beginner please.  I am trying to use Highcharts with some data I have stored in a database.  I am encoding a php array and passing it to jquery but I get an error straight away.  Could someone please have a look at this file and tell me where I am going wrong? - http://pastie.org/10275693
[06:48:32] <Cork> blinky_: 'name: ' + names[i], <--
[06:48:59] <Cork> blinky_: you should NOT generate the json by hand
[06:49:06] <Cork> use json_encode
[06:49:49] <Cork> uh...
[06:49:51] <Cork> wait...
[06:50:00] <Cork> blinky_: are you defining a variable inside an object?
[06:50:06] <blinky_> Cork, I am using json_encode on line 10 to encode the php array into jquery, is that correct?
[06:50:07] <FilipNortic> Cork: ok, I think is something with linebreaks or swedish chars that make it count wrong...
[06:50:47] <RabSimpson> hi folks. how should checkbox interactions be handled? i'm currently using .on( 'change' ) which works as expected when the box is checked, but the value doesn't appear to change when the box is unchecked. any ideas?
[06:51:03] <Cork> blinky_: make a php array with arrays with named keys in them (name, data)
[06:51:10] <Cork> blinky_: and name should be another array
[06:51:19] <Cork> and it should have the values you have
[06:51:40] <Cork> blinky_: and then you just set that top most array to series though json_encode
[06:52:56] <Cork> FilipNortic: nope works fine here as far as i can tell
[06:53:28] <Cork> RabSimpson: this.checked or $(this).prop('checked') (same thing=
[06:53:30] <Cork> *)
[06:53:47] <Cork> RabSimpson: the value of the checkbox is what is included in the form when the checkbox is checked
[06:53:49] <RabSimpson> i'll give it a bash :)
[06:54:03] <Cork> it doesn't change
[06:55:02] <RabSimpson> ahhh, i see
[06:55:30] <RabSimpson> it's now working as expected, thanks cork :)
[06:55:38] <Cork> np
[06:59:07] <FilipNortic> ok thanks for the help, but chrome really does count the linebreak as 2 chars here
[07:01:35] <FilipNortic> it counts enter as \r\n
[07:02:13] <Cork> FilipNortic: it isn't two characters here :)
[07:02:21] <Cork> and that is prob why i don't see the problem :D
[07:02:29] <Cork> <-- linux
[07:02:55] <FilipNortic> yeah I would use it if I was allowed but my boss want evenrybody on the same os
[07:03:00] <workerbeetwo> Cork: then I will have to wait a certain time to give chance to load.
[07:03:17] <Cork> workerbeetwo: that is a really bad idea
[07:03:34] <Cork> cause if it is using the network you WILL have a racy solution
[07:03:49] <Cork> and if you aren't you still have a risk
[07:03:57] <Cork> (cpu load)
[07:04:28] <workerbeetwo> Cork: I do risk it.
[07:06:58] <rubyronin> hep_: how did you make out?
[07:13:03] <Cyclohexane> Is it possible to do .data() for each row in a table?
[07:13:25] <Cork> Cyclohexane: sure
[07:13:31] <Cyclohexane> how?
[07:13:48] <Cork> table.find('tr').each(function() { $(this).data() });
[07:14:00] <Cyclohexane> figured I'd have to use each :p
[07:14:01] <Cyclohexane> thanks
[07:14:08] <Cork> well or .map
[07:14:13] <Cork> depending on what you want to do
[07:14:35] <bongjovi> Can anyone suggest a library that I can use to view images by dragging from desktop?
[07:14:39] <bongjovi> don't need to be uploaded
[07:14:59] <bongjovi> just need a quick way to view an image in a certain position
[07:15:12] <Cork> bongjovi: you don't really need a library
[07:15:26] <Cork> just a few lines of js + a canvas
[07:15:31] <Cyclohexane> Cork: ultimately i want to serialize it, so I get &id[]=1&id[]=2 etc
[07:15:37] <bongjovi> ah okay I can use canvas for that?
[07:15:42] <Cork> yes
[07:15:53] <Cork> bongjovi: use dnd grab the dropped file
[07:15:58] <djam90> Hi.. I am using the jQuery UI accordion.. it is performing slow.. like when it is open, i click the header to close it, and it takes like 1s for it to work
[07:16:01] <Cork> use filereader and get a filuri
[07:16:06] <Cork> give that uri to the canvas
[07:16:07] <Cork> done
[07:16:22] <Cork> bongjovi: actually if you don't want to do anything fancy you could use a simple <img> tag too
[07:16:38] <Cork> filuri==fileuri
[07:18:27] <bongjovi> ah okay i can use an event to get the fileuri and just replace the image src with that?
[07:19:29] <Cork> bongjovi: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsDataURL
[07:19:40] <Cork> check the example
[07:19:50] <Cork> it uses an input field
[07:19:56] <Cork> but dnd works the same way just with the drop event
[07:21:04] <bongjovi> thanks
[07:21:48] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications#Selecting_files_using_drag_and_drop
[07:21:53] <Cork> that should give you all you need
[07:22:19] <djam90> Would having 8 accordions make closing an accordion be slow?
[07:22:37] <workerbeetwo> Cork: and thank you, by the way.
[07:23:24] <Cork> djam90: haven't used accordion in ages (cause it had performance and styling problems)
[07:23:33] <Cork> but i think yes
[07:23:34] <Cyclohexane> Cork: what's up with this? $.param( $('#table').find('tr').map(function() { return $(this).data(); }) ); I just get &undefined=undefined&..
[07:23:58] <Cork> Cyclohexane: you can't use .map like that
[07:24:36] <Cork> $.param( $.map($('#table').find('tr'), function(elm) { return $(elm).data(); }) );
[07:24:49] <Cork> MIGHT work, if .data gives the correct keys
[07:24:57] <Cork> meaning name and value
[07:38:13] <zagaza> is jquery slidetoggle choppy on mobile for everyone?
[07:38:38] <ramkam2013> hello hello jquery, it's been a while !
[07:39:06] <Cork> zagaza: slide depends on js
[07:39:15] <Cork> so yes it will be choppier then if you use css3
[07:40:08] <zagaza> the problem is, css max-height animation is choppy on mobile too for me
[07:40:40] <MikeD_> have you ever tried to look at a script in IE(10) and the content appears to be chinese?
[08:03:01] <jayjo> are there recommended ajax loading images? Sort of like a standard library?

[08:51:05] <placidb> hi. jquery newbie here. in my code I have two input fields with the same name (but with different ids), that need to update each other on change. if I update the input field, the HTML in the browser inspector's element viewer isn't updated. the server also doesn't receive the updated value. what am I doing wrong?
[08:51:34] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and show us what you have.
[08:58:08] <gambl0re> hi robertmatrix...
[08:58:18] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re bad autocomplete?
[08:58:52] <gambl0re> i need your hrlp
[08:58:56] <robertmaxrees> whose?
[09:00:40] <gambl0re> https://jsfiddle.net/Lmdw43xw/
[09:00:50] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re are you talking to me or somebody else?
[09:00:59] <gambl0re> you of course...
[09:01:38] <gambl0re> how do i add a loading status/icon/whatever after i click the ask button and then dissapear after a certain amount of time 5,10 secs
[09:04:39] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re you keep using somebody else's username when you ping me ;)
[09:06:41] <robertmaxrees> either way, you use a timeout.
[09:08:10] <gambl0re> how
[09:08:21] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript set timeout
[09:08:30] <gambl0re> you mean set interval?
[09:08:36] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:08:37] <robertmaxrees> a timeout.
[09:08:43] <gambl0re> !g javascript set interval
[09:08:45] <robertmaxrees> intervals are to do something every x seconds.
[09:08:51] <robertmaxrees> you want a timeout, which does it once.
[09:09:00] <gambl0re> is it jquery?
[09:09:06] <robertmaxrees> it's javascript.
[09:09:10] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout
[09:09:29] <robertmaxrees> window.setTimeout(function() { console.log('it's been 5 seconds') }, 5000);
[09:10:36] <gambl0re> oh yes....thanks
[09:18:59] <Morbus> g'day. i suck at javascript and I suck at jquery. front end stuff is not my cup of tea.
[09:19:02] <Morbus> here's my problem.
[09:19:26] <Morbus> a) on page load, a form is sucked in via AJAX. tweaking certain other elements of the page cause the form to be re-sucked in from AJAX.
[09:19:46] <Morbus> b) on   $(document).ready(function() {, i've got some code that attempts to trigger on that form, like:
[09:19:51] <Morbus>     $('#uc-authorizenet-simdpm-form').submit(function(e) {
[09:19:51] <Morbus>       e.preventDefault();
[09:19:51] <Morbus>     });
[09:20:07] <robertmaxrees> a) no problem statement.
[09:20:13] <robertmaxrees> b) please don't paste code into the channel :)
[09:20:31] <robertmaxrees> b.2) you want to use the ajax .done() callback to trigger the function.
[09:20:32] <Morbus> c) however, this doesn't work - the form submits as normal. my suspicion is that the AJAX reloads are causing the initial document ready to "lose" association with the form - as it's being added/re-added/re-added, etc.
[09:20:49] <robertmaxrees> .submit(function(e) {});  is an event handler.  that's not triggering anything.
[09:21:22] <robertmaxrees> so you want $.ajax({/* your ajax config here */}).done(function() { $('#someForm'}.submit());
[09:21:24] <Morbus> when i say "trigger", i meant "fire on", not jquery's definition of "trigger", which I am ignorant of.
[09:21:28] <Morbus> again, i suck at this ;)
[09:21:40] <robertmaxrees> so you want the submit to trigger a function?
[09:21:41] <Morbus> regarding ajax done stuff.. ok...
[09:21:49] <Morbus> what if *i'm* not the one calling the ajax?
[09:21:59] <Uhkis> delegation is the key here?
[09:22:01] <Morbus> it's handled upstream in the application. my custom code doesn't deal with it at all.
[09:22:17] <robertmaxrees> Morbus you could use a delegated listener.
[09:22:34] <robertmaxrees> $('body').on('submit', 'form', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[09:22:47] <oste> i am trying to wait for the user to scroll past an element before triggering some code, the problem is when i do $(element).height() i get something like 1000px, and when i do $(window).scrollTop() it is always less than that
[09:23:00] <Morbus> robertmaxrees: does that go into the document ready?
[09:23:05] <Morbus> robertmaxrees: your body sample...
[09:23:07] <robertmaxrees> Morbus sure.
[09:23:13] <oste> i am checking the $(window).scrollTop in $(window).scroll(function () {
[09:23:37] <robertmaxrees> oste show some code :)
[09:23:41] <Morbus> robertmaxrees: i'm confused how that body approach is different or "better" than my current $(#actual-form-id).submit... ?
[09:24:00] <robertmaxrees> Morbus it's a delegated listener.
[09:24:08] <Morbus> and what's mine?
[09:24:14] <robertmaxrees> a direct binding.
[09:24:20] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[09:24:22] <Morbus> ah ha.
[09:24:28] <robertmaxrees> and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[09:24:31] <robertmaxrees> they'll explain it./
[09:24:54] <robertmaxrees> basically, it skirts your entire problem - you don't need to worry about what will be where on the page.
[09:25:38] <Morbus> so the listener always uses the "latest" version of the page, vs. a direct binding to something that may exist, deexist, exist again?
[09:25:43] <Morbus> (due to ajax refreshes)?
[09:25:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:25:53] <robertmaxrees> the links i pasted above point out that events bubble.
[09:26:02] <Morbus> alrighty. thanks. will readaread.
[09:26:06] <robertmaxrees> you're binding to the body of the page and letting that propagation fire the handler.
[09:26:11] <robertmaxrees> nothing refreshes :)
[09:27:10] <robertmaxrees> $('body').on('submit', 'form', function() {}); binds a listener to body that triggers when a "submit" event emit from a form element.
[09:27:11] <oste> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/weeuwn49/
[09:27:39] <robertmaxrees> oste so first off, don't run $(window) in that function.
[09:27:53] <oste> ok
[09:28:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/weeuwn49/1/
[09:28:28] <robertmaxrees> second off, depending one what you're doing here, you probably want to debounce your handler.
[09:28:35] <oste> same result, how would you know that the user scrolled PAST the blue div
[09:28:39] <oste> meh, this is just a simple concept
[09:28:41] <robertmaxrees> define "past"?
[09:29:55] <oste> https://jsfiddle.net/weeuwn49/3/
[09:30:13] <robertmaxrees> words pls :)
[09:30:22] <robertmaxrees> i assume you mean the bottom of the viewport has passed the blue div?
[09:30:27] <oste> just when teh blue passes the bottom
[09:31:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/weeuwn49/4/
[09:31:10] <robertmaxrees> that should get you started :)
[09:32:01] <oste> thank you sir :)
[09:32:07] <robertmaxrees> get the basic idea?
[09:34:09] <oste> yep, needed that window.height() part, doh
[09:55:39] <xnotte> when sending with $.get a parameter content = "<p>teste</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>teste2</p> " i have a 500 server error. Its expecting a string in server side. If i set content="test" everything goes fine. Do i need to serialize the html tags?
[09:56:04] <robertmaxrees> 500 means your server is failing.
[09:56:10] <robertmaxrees> so you need to look server-side to see what the issue is.
[10:01:37] <tasaif> What is a good piece of software for making mockups?
[10:17:14] <hectortrope> Hello Guys anyone knows SAP UI5?
[10:21:32] <Abhijit> can I put a link to my js file inside an iframe?
[10:23:20] <robertmaxrees> sure why not?
[10:24:34] <Abhijit> ok
[10:24:42] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit it won't do anything for content outside of the iframe though.
[10:26:52] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, i need to insert a video player code to run multiple video file one after onether. which is already in my javascript file. if i insert this file will this playing work?
[10:34:44] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit i have no idea what your code is trying to do.
[10:34:57] <robertmaxrees> if it just needs access to the contents of the iframe, you should be golden.
[10:35:15] <Abhijit> i need to play <video> inside the iframe
[10:35:23] <Abhijit> just like youtube embed option
[10:36:48] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, put your js inside the iframe.
[10:36:52] <robertmaxrees> it's a separate window, basically.
[10:37:38] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, so i set iframe src to my js file laction is that right? or i copy paste my js inside iframe?
[10:37:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:38:02] <robertmaxrees> you add a link in your iframe source to point to the js file.
[10:38:08] <Abhijit> ok. thanks.
[10:38:08] <robertmaxrees> just like you would with any other page.
[10:38:18] <robertmaxrees> the iframe is a full, valid, other page.
[10:38:38] <Abhijit> ok
[10:40:28] <cluelessperson> Hello all
[10:40:52] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, when i do iframe src="myjs.js" it shows the actual content of the js on that page?
[10:41:14] <Chunk2> So, what's the best way to implement a dropdown menu in jquery?  IE have it disappear when you click on anything else but it.  I've done something approaching right a few times, but I always run into different behaviors between browsers regarding what DOM elements bubble and under what circumstances.
[10:41:22] <cluelessperson> Hey guys, I'm trying to figure out how to use a dictionary with jquery, but I can't seem to get this part right.   https://jsfiddle.net/y22x59cv/1/
[10:41:25] <cluelessperson> Any ideas
[10:41:58] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit right, that's not what you do.
[10:42:12] <robertmaxrees> you link it within the actualy iframe source page like anyt other js file.
[10:42:45] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, ok. thanks.
[10:43:01] <cjohnson> cluelessperson: 1: they're called objects not dictionaries. 2: you have an error, open your console and resolve it
[10:44:06] <cluelessperson> cjohnson: "Cannot read property length of undefined"   isn't very descriptive.  I don't know what to do with that.
[10:44:45] <cjohnson> cluelessperson: https://jsfiddle.net/y22x59cv/2/  here's a hint
[10:44:59] <Chunk2> it means that what you're calling for length on is undefined
[10:46:49] <cluelessperson> Chunk2: Should just be another object, no?
[10:49:12] <robertmaxrees> cluelessperson https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y22x59cv/3/
[10:49:42] <robertmaxrees> Chunk2 the click event propagates in pretty much every browser unless something stops it.
[10:49:43] <Zeranoe> Does jquery provide an easy way to increment the html inside a  div? example: <div class="count">1234</div> and jquery can add one to the <div> content to make it <div class="count">1235</div>
[10:50:35] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe nope.  you'd need to do something like $('.count').text(parseInt($('.count').text(), 10)++);
[10:51:16] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees: did you change something?
[10:51:24] <robertmaxrees> cluelessperson i added a console log.
[10:51:37] <Chunk2> robertmaxrees: the problem I have is that how the click event propagates, what order the events are called, and what is able to stop what
[10:51:43] <Chunk2> differs between browsers
[10:51:51] <robertmaxrees> Chunk2 it shouldn't matter the order.
[10:51:54] <robertmaxrees> show a code sample?
[10:53:01] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees: I don't understand how it's undefined..
[10:53:24] <robertmaxrees> cluelessperson console.log($('#bound').val()); returns IB or OB
[10:53:36] <robertmaxrees> the object properties are Inbound and Outbound
[10:53:40] <cluelessperson> it's a another object, no?   {'1' : ['val', 'val']}, {'2' : ['val', 'val']},
[10:53:56] <robertmaxrees> cluelessperson you're trying to do call_breakdown.IB
[10:53:58] <robertmaxrees> which is nothing.
[10:54:29] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees: Ah, so that's what I missed, hurrr durrrr
[10:57:37] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees: Yeah, that really is undefined. :/  thanks
[10:57:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:57:59] <springbej> is there any available advice for jquery ui autocomplete widget using a response ajax request as the source?
[11:02:54] <Chunk2> robertmaxrees: I just did a JSFiddle and it works flawlessly in everything I've tried.  I'm dumbfounded.
[11:07:04] <Chunk2> it must be something in wordpress

[13:15:01] <kevireilly> check the javascript console
[13:15:04] <mojtaba> I am spending almost a day on it
[13:15:20] <mojtaba> Please help if sb know what is wrong
[13:15:22] <kevireilly> Do you have jQuery UI included on the page?
[13:15:36] <mojtaba> yes, <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
[13:15:45] <kevireilly> `spinner` is now a native jQuery method, it is a jQuery UI method https://jqueryui.com/
[13:15:49] <kevireilly> *is not
[13:16:10] <kevireilly> https://jqueryui.com/spinner/
[13:16:31] <mojtaba> kevireilly: should I add sth else? beside the one that I pasted?
[13:16:39] <kevireilly> yes, jQuery UI
[13:16:48] <kevireilly> jQuery !== jQuery UI
[13:16:48] <mojtaba> kevireilly: oh. thanks. my bad
[13:16:56] <mojtaba> kevireilly: I am newbie. sorry
[13:17:00] <kevireilly> no problem at all
[13:17:26] <mojtaba> thank you very much
[13:17:32] <kevireilly> happy to help
[13:28:00] <mojtaba> kevireilly: sorry for asking naive question. what is the msdn address for the jqueryui?
[13:29:10] <kevireilly> mojtaba: nah no worries https://code.jquery.com/ui/
[13:29:28] <mojtaba> thanks
[13:32:31] <mojtaba> kevireilly: sorry, but I added this <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/jquery-ui.min.js"></script> to that file and it is still not working. any idea?
[13:33:18] <rumpel> mojtaba, why https?
[13:33:35] <mojtaba> rumpel: I just copied the link
[13:33:55] <mojtaba> rumpel: I changed it to http
[13:34:27] <mojtaba> rumpel: still same issue
[13:35:00] <kevireilly> mojtaba: please open your javascript console and see if there are any errors
[13:36:22] <mojtaba> It says: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .
[13:38:32] <kevireilly> mojtaba: on the right, click the underlined text so that it shows you where
[13:40:01] <ngharo> mojtaba: pretty sure your problem is you have a comma instead of a semi-colon at the end of line 7 on your pastebin
[13:40:20] <ngharo> that would be fine if you were declaring another variable on line 8, but you're not
[13:40:50] <achilles14> mojtaba: Did it point out to where the error exactly is?
[13:41:09] <mojtaba> achilles14: I am trying to find it.
[13:41:26] <achilles14> mojtaba: Did you open the console?
[13:41:41] <mojtaba> achilles14: yes
[13:42:14] <achilles14> mojtaba: Click on the right side of the error where there is a link sort of thing
[13:42:36] <achilles14> Not on the red text but on the black one
[13:43:49] <mojtaba> achilles14: It shows this, http://paste.ubuntu.com/11832768/
[13:44:35] <achilles14> mojtaba: Do u want the msdn version of jquery ui or is it okay if you download the file
[13:44:47] <achilles14> so that we can trace the error if it is with linking jquery ui only
[13:45:25] <mojtaba> achilles14: Actually I am using sourcer in the joomla. so it is a little difficult for me to point to that file.
[13:46:15] <amtrivedi> Hello
[13:46:16] <amtrivedi> I have a checkbox on a page, I want to check if the checkbox was changed or was untouched during the entire time when the page was opened. How do I do it?
[13:46:24] <achilles14> mojtaba: just for the purpose of debugging, remove the link to jquery ui
[13:46:32] <achilles14> mojtaba: and tell me if there are any errors
[13:47:08] <mojtaba> achilles14: the problem was with that , at line 7, but the thing is that it was , on the jsfiddle.net file too!
[13:47:14] <mojtaba> It was working there
[13:47:26] <ngharo> mojtaba: yep, like i said.  Change that comma to a semi-colon
[13:47:36] <mojtaba> the arrows are below the box not inside it.
[13:47:36] <ngharo> and you're done
[13:47:51] <achilles14> amtrivedi: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1ca5d107c814bcf67255
[13:48:02] <mojtaba> ngharo: Do you know how should I put those arrows inside the box, like input number type?
[13:48:24] <achilles14> amtrivedi: that will help you trigger a function when the checkbox status is changed
[13:48:43] <achilles14> amtrivedi: Here is a link for more info. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7031226/jquery-checkbox-change-and-click-event
[13:49:09] <ngharo> mojtaba: do you have a link to what you're working on?  I don't know what you mean
[13:49:22] <amtrivedi> achilles14: Thanks a lot :)
[13:49:23] <mojtaba> ngharo: http://www.kabobhutcanada.com/test11/form-menu
[13:49:38] <achilles14> amtrivedi: No problem. Did it work?
[13:50:05] <amtrivedi> achilles14: Trying it out, but seems it is what I wanted.
[13:50:14] <achilles14> amtrivedi: Okay. Cool!
[13:51:09] <jayjo> Does anyone know of a colorpicker that has preset values along with the ability to custom select a color?
[13:51:25] <mojtaba> ngharo: Did you see that?
[13:51:37] <ngharo> mojtaba: include the jquery-ui css
[13:52:39] <mojtaba> ngharo: there are lots of css files. which one?
[13:53:17] <ngharo> You can pick a theme, but try this as a start: https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css
[13:53:52] <mojtaba> ngharo: thx
[13:54:12] <ngharo> np
[13:56:04] <pyCasso> is it possible through ajax to grab all inline scripts and append them to a page?
[13:56:13] <Uranium|OC> So i coded this form to be posted via ajax, get to the final bit and i realize ajax cant handle file inputs? any ideas on a quick fix?
[13:56:30] <mojtaba> ngharo: both of the arrows are up!
[13:57:05] <Uranium|OC> pyCasso:  could probably loop through the dop looking at the .css property
[13:57:12] <Uranium|OC> the DOM*
[13:58:03] <kevireilly> Uranium|OC: whats the code look like?
[13:58:19] <Uranium|OC> kevireilly:  1 moment pb it
[13:58:58] <Uranium|OC> http://pastebin.com/qZ6uGyeJ
[13:59:01] <ngharo> pyCasso: jquery eval()'s any script tags it finds in ajax responses
[13:59:20] <ngharo> at least it used to, haven't tried that in a long time :)
[13:59:21] <Uranium|OC> just a form with a ajax post, cant seem to find a way or there is no way for ajax to handle a file upload
[14:01:20] <ngharo> Uranium|OC: https://api.jquery.com/serialize/ will help you clean up that code a bit
[14:01:30] <Uranium|OC> ngharo tyty
[14:01:48] <ngharo> as far as file uploads, you could try qqUploader
[14:02:00] <ngharo> i've had luck with it in the past
[14:02:02] <Uranium|OC> i got the post submit to work for everything but the file
[14:02:24] <Uranium|OC> ngharo:  is qquploader light weight
[14:02:43] <ngharo> nothing is anymore.  get used to it :)
[14:02:49] <Uranium|OC> lol
[14:02:58] <Uranium|OC> <3
[14:03:42] <Uranium|OC> welp its 5 oclock, its tomorrow's problem now
[14:14:27] <mojtaba> do you know what is the event method of the spinner on changing of the value? (no matter using mouse or keyboard)
[14:15:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:16:18] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: was that for me?
[14:16:22] <robertmaxrees> yes
[14:16:26] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you mean?
[14:17:01] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I want to update some field when the value in the input box changes. http://www.kabobhutcanada.com/test11/form-menu    the first spinner
[14:17:18] <robertmaxrees> "spinner"?
[14:17:35] <robertmaxrees> either way, you want the change event.
[14:17:40] <kevireilly> Uranium|OC: I was going to suggest checking out FormData
[14:18:00] <kevireilly> `spinner` is a jQuery UI method
[14:18:31] <mojtaba> kevireilly: sorry for misusing the word
[14:18:43] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: yes I want the change event
[14:18:55] <kevireilly> oh I was just pointing out to rob what spinner was
[14:18:58] <mojtaba> I am using this at the moment 	$(":input").bind('mouseup keyup', function(){alert("hey, changed");});
[14:19:03] <kevireilly> http://api.jqueryui.com/spinner/#event-change
[14:19:09] <robertmaxrees> use .on()
[14:19:12] <robertmaxrees> not .bind()
[14:19:37] <robertmaxrees> unless you're on an ancient version of jquery
[14:19:56] <arc_> there should be a way to mark SO posts as using deprecated solutions
[14:20:17] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: It does not trigger the event using arrows to change the value
[14:20:19] <robertmaxrees> you're supposed to create a new response, but that rarely works the way it should.
[14:20:23] <arc_> heh
[14:20:25] <mojtaba> I am using the latest version
[14:20:39] <kevireilly> arc_: you can modify a post after a certain amount of points
[14:20:56] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba use http://api.jqueryui.com/spinner/#event-change
[14:21:07] <robertmaxrees> like kevireilly already pointed out :)
[14:21:11] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I will check it. thx
[14:23:17] <arc_> could there be a way to test whether a click event is fired by a hardware click or programmatically
[14:23:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:23:43] <robertmaxrees> i can't remembet, but the event object is different between the two.
[14:24:07] <arc_> i thought so. i guess reddit is doing that to prevent people from creating a script that automatically expands all comments in a thread
[14:25:26] <robertmaxrees> e.originalEvent
[14:25:33] <arc_> i see
[14:25:50] <arc_> thanks
[14:26:55] <arc_> yep they're definitely using that
[14:27:27] <robertmaxrees> they're probably ajaxing in threads.
[14:28:01] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: could you please give me an example on using change event?
[14:28:15] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba the one from jquery ui or...?
[14:28:32] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: yes, please. What is wrong with this: 	$(".foods").on("spinchange", function('mouseup keyup', ui){alert("hey, changed");});
[14:29:01] <robertmaxrees> function('mouseup keyup', ui) - this is.
[14:29:15] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I do not understand what does it mean initialize the spinner with the change callback
[14:29:17] <robertmaxrees> start with just  	$(".foods").on("spinchange", function() {alert("hey, changed"); });
[14:29:36] <robertmaxrees> are you using html or javascript to setup the spinner?
[14:30:26] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I am using javascript
[14:30:45] <robertmaxrees> then add the change option to the object you pass.
[14:31:20] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: ok, thanks
[14:38:40] <mojtaba> I am trying to update value of the input field upon value change of another one. http://paste.ubuntu.com/11832974/
[14:38:45] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:38:48] <robertmaxrees> we just went through this.
[14:39:27] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: It triggers that alert function, and works fine. But this one is not working
[14:39:36] <ramsub07> hello, i've an <input> tag. I need to highlight words in that input tag. if i hit spacebar after typing series of characters, that word should get highlighted. How should I do ?
[14:39:37] <robertmaxrees> okay - so let's help you get it working :)
[14:39:38] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: could you please take a brief look at it
[14:39:47] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: thank you soooo much
[14:40:07] <robertmaxrees> $(".foods").on("spinchange", updatePrice);
[14:40:15] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba get rid of the parents after updatePrice
[14:40:23] <robertmaxrees> also, you shouldn't need $(".foods").each(function() {
[14:40:38] <robertmaxrees> $('foods').spinner({min: 0, max: 100, step: 1}); should work fine
[14:40:51] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I have lots of .foods elements
[14:40:56] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[14:41:11] <robertmaxrees> jquery does that .each() for you.
[14:41:22] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: what do you mean by get ride of parents after updatePrice
[14:42:16] <robertmaxrees> just do $(".foods").on("spinchange", updatePrice);
[14:42:18] <robertmaxrees> not $(".foods").on("spinchange", updatePrice());
[14:43:07] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: thanks. I will check that
[14:44:13] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: Still it is not working
[14:46:02] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: Do you know what could be wrong?
[14:46:29] <mojtaba> I just changed to $('foods').spinner({min: 0, max: 100, step: 1}); and removed the () from the function
[14:46:51] <robertmaxrees> $('.foods')
[14:47:05] <pixonix> list
[14:47:10] <pixonix> list
[14:47:18] <monk3y> heh pixonix.
[14:47:22] <monk3y> "/list"
[14:47:23] <robertmaxrees> need a slash before that, pixonix
[14:47:23] <pixonix> wrong window
[14:47:23] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: you mean ' instead of "?
[14:47:33] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba interchangable.
[14:47:53] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: what is the problem with $('.foods') then?
[14:48:05] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball
[14:48:11] <robertmaxrees> dunno i can't see your site/.
[14:48:22] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: http://www.kabobhutcanada.com/test11/form-menu
[14:48:27] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle please.
[14:48:41] <mojtaba>  robertmaxrees: sure, please wait
[14:49:33] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[14:49:39] <ramsub07> hello, i've an <input> tag. I need to highlight words in that input tag. if i hit spacebar after typing series of characters, that word should get highlighted. How should I do ?
[14:49:42] <robertmaxrees> why am I seeing "$ is not a function"
[14:50:03] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 i'm not sure that you can.
[14:50:09] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 what are you actually trying to do?
[14:50:40] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to create tags. Like what StackOverflow has
[14:51:37] <CrowX-> why can't I just $(this).trigger('change') from within a 'change' event handler?
[14:52:28] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[14:52:38] <robertmaxrees> CrowX- what do you mean "can't"?
[14:52:42] <robertmaxrees> what isn't working?
[14:52:55] <CrowX-> robertmaxrees, it doesn't :)
[14:53:03] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't what?
[14:53:07] <CrowX-> I have a console.log at the beginning of the handler, and it doesn't fire a second time
[14:53:20] <robertmaxrees> okay - can you show the code?
[14:53:26] <robertmaxrees> because that could be for all sorts of reasons.
[14:54:38] <CrowX-> robertmaxrees, here you go https://dpaste.de/rtE2
[14:55:15] <robertmaxrees> $(this).trigger('propertychange'); - $(this) is no longer the element there.
[14:55:25] <robertmaxrees> you're inside the ajax call at that point.
[14:55:36] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: fiddle.jshell.net has an internal error, I can not make an account
[14:55:38] <mojtaba> :(
[14:55:47] <yaymukund> `deferred.then(fn1).then(fn2)` <- if fn1 returns a promise, does fn2 execute after it has resolved (a la spec-compliant promises)?
[14:55:55] <yaymukund> (aka https://gist.github.com/yaymukund/87da3b478767f69ab4bd)
[14:56:00] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba you don't need an account to save,
[14:56:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/ - click "save" mojtaba
[14:56:22] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: http://fiddle.jshell.net/yogL1abt/
[14:56:22] <CrowX-> robertmaxrees, what solution would you prefer?
[14:56:24] <mojtaba> thx
[14:56:27] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: pretty much the functionality what i wanted. But can't it be something like i just type, hit space and the values get highlighted ?
[14:56:38] <CrowX-> robertmaxrees, how do I access the object from the ajax call?
[14:56:42] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 it's not that easy.
[14:56:47] <robertmaxrees> CrowX- https://dpaste.de/ZtvJ#L14,29
[14:56:49] <robertmaxrees> this is one way.
[14:57:03] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: hmm, okay. will stick to this then. Thanks !
[14:57:03] <robertmaxrees> yaymukund it should.
[14:58:49] <yaymukund> hmm okay. I've just been rereading this paragraph about the return value of `then` (https://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/) trying to figure out when the returned promise actually resolves
[14:59:00] <CrowX-> robertmaxrees, what is changed?
[14:59:23] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: could you please check this too? http://fiddle.jshell.net/yogL1abt/
[14:59:46] <robertmaxrees> CrowX- var $this = $(this); then I reference $this in the ajax call.
[14:59:47] <yaymukund> I guess the "Chain tasks" example at the bottom is my situation
[15:00:06] <CrowX-> robertmaxrees, thanks
[15:00:16] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba that's not how you use jsfiddle.  one sec.
[15:00:56] <CrowX-> robertmaxrees, thanks a lot!
[15:01:04] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba http://fiddle.jshell.net/yogL1abt/2/
[15:01:47] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: But I added some external resource.
[15:01:57] <robertmaxrees> not correctly.
[15:02:34] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I have the same thing, but why that one is not working?
[15:02:36] <mojtaba> !!
[15:02:49] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba yours doesn't work because you linked the enternal resources incorrectly.
[15:02:50] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:03:27] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/yogL1abt/3/
[15:03:29] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple.
[15:04:10] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: thank you very much
[15:04:14] <mojtaba> I will check them now
[15:06:13] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: the only difference is in the spin function, right?
[15:06:42] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: It is very odd!!
[15:06:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i used the event name i think you wanted.
[15:07:17] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: spin
[15:07:18] <mojtaba> ?
[15:07:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  spinchange fires after it loses fcus
[15:07:31] <robertmaxrees> *focus
[15:10:52] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I do not know why when I change the event name to spin, I can not change the value of the first input box with mouse and keyboard.
[15:11:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:11:26] <robertmaxrees> oh, because that's a different event.  try 'spin input' for the event
[15:12:30] <mojtaba> $(".foods").on("spin input", updatePrice);
[15:12:40] <mojtaba> It is not working too!
[15:12:41] <robertmaxrees> did you try?
[15:12:46] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: yes
[15:12:46] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[15:12:51] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle.
[15:13:42] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: may be my configuration is not correct. http://fiddle.jshell.net/yogL1abt/4/
[15:14:10] <mojtaba> I mean in my original work. (although I am using msdn for both jquery and jqueryui(
[15:14:34] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: when you change the value to 1 in the fiddle it does not update the other input field.
[15:14:47] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[15:14:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm at work yo - gimme a minute :)
[15:15:03] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: sorry
[15:16:53] <robertmaxrees> that works fine here, mojtaba
[15:17:25] <mojtaba> http://fiddle.jshell.net/yogL1abt/4/ When I change to one it does nothing. It starts at 2!
[15:17:54] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[15:17:57] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I am using latest version of chrom on ubuntu 14.04 LTS
[15:18:05] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba i see it now.
[15:18:23] <robertmaxrees> something about function updatePrice() { looks wrong.
[15:18:26] <robertmaxrees> hrmmmmm.
[15:19:36] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: Is it correct to use .val to read and write values?
[15:20:06] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: It seems it reads the previous value!
[15:20:31] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: 11 gives the value of the 10 for example.
[15:25:10] <pixonix> @robertmaxrees, yes you can use .val() to read and write from form field elements
[15:25:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware of as much ;)
[15:25:41] <pixonix> sorry, saw the question above
[15:25:58] <robertmaxrees> you want http://api.jqueryui.com/spinner/#method-value however
[15:26:17] <robertmaxrees> give that a shot.
[15:26:48] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I will check that.

[15:29:28] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: It gives the previous value
[15:29:43] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:29:51] <gambl0re> robertmatrix are you good in mysql?
[15:30:01] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re you keep making the same mistake.

[15:31:14] <robertmaxrees> look to see what the bug is.
[15:31:57] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: mine does not even change the value
[15:32:03] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[15:32:04] <mojtaba> ok
[15:32:19] <robertmaxrees> $ is not a function
[15:32:48] <robertmaxrees> because you're using noconflict.
[15:33:00] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: ?
[15:33:06] <robertmaxrees> ... open your console.
[15:33:12] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[15:33:28] <mojtaba> yes it says $ is not a funciton
[15:33:34] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[15:33:35] <mojtaba> What does it mean?
[15:33:40] <mojtaba> where it came from?
[15:33:43] <robertmaxrees> you're loading a file that's running noconflict mode.
[15:33:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to use jQuery instead of $
[15:34:08] <mojtaba> what?
[15:34:21] <mojtaba> I should replace $ everywhere with jQuery?
[15:34:53] <robertmaxrees> in your code, yes.  or wrap all of your code with (function($) { /* your code here */ } (jQuery));
[15:36:38] <mojtaba> you mean <script> function($) {/*my codes */}(jQuery)</script>
[15:36:40] <mojtaba> right?
[15:36:42] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees:
[15:36:44] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:36:52] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I will check that. thanks
[15:40:05] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I really thank you and very appreciate your time. It is now working. I will stick to spinchange though
[15:40:13] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[15:40:14] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: spin is reading previous value
[15:40:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:50:42] <Android0> Just want to verify I'm understanding this correctly, this $('.button').click(function(){blablabla}); losely equates to, when this button is clicked preferm the following function/method?
[15:50:56] <robertmaxrees> basically teah.
[15:54:41] <Android0> Great, I'm currently using codecademy, jon duckets javascript & jquery as well as the jquery website to learn. Anything else you care to recommend?
[15:55:19] <robertmaxrees> the api docs, learn.jquery.com, mdn for raw JS, javascript: the definitive guide, and javascript: the good parts are all solid.
[15:59:21] <mojtaba> I am trying to use 6.98 in my calculation. $(".foods").each(function(){$(this).val() * ???} http://paste.ubuntu.com/11833257/  Do you know how can I get access to it? ( I guess I should use innerhtml, but I do not know how to reach it and also how to strip out $ from it.)
[15:59:36] <robertmaxrees> .text()
[16:00:22] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: How should I reach the label related to this input? (I have lots of this <tr></tr>
[16:00:29] <robertmaxrees> give it a class.
[16:00:35] <robertmaxrees> or a unique ID.
[16:01:22] <mojtaba> both of input and label has same unique id, but the problem is that I have two label associated with that input field, all with the same unique id.
[16:01:23] <Android0> or use the css selector, nth-child?
[16:01:44] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba you can't use an ID more than once on a page.
[16:02:23] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: sorry, I have given id to the input and use that value as a value for the 'for' attribute of the label.
[16:03:14] <robertmaxrees> (make a fiddle - show me what you're trying to do)
[16:03:31] <mojtaba> basically I want to calculate input1*6.98 + input2*8.98 http://paste.ubuntu.com/11833273/
[16:03:39] <robertmaxrees> then do that?
[16:04:04] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I don't know how to have access to the specified elements. I will try to make a fiddle
[16:07:00] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/ It is not complete
[16:07:13] <robertmaxrees> then why are you sending it to me?
[16:07:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:07:29] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I don't know how to complete it. :D
[16:08:03] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:08:06] <robertmaxrees> something is really broken here..
[16:08:27] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I do not know how can I reach each price related to each field, after val() *
[16:08:30] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/2/ ah
[16:08:54] <robertmaxrees> is this really your markup?
[16:09:39] <mojtaba> let me put the css too
[16:09:44] <robertmaxrees> actually.
[16:09:50] <robertmaxrees> you needed to add the table tag around the html.
[16:09:54] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/3/
[16:09:57] <robertmaxrees> check this out.
[16:10:13] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/4/ - with jquery ui added.
[16:10:58] <mojtaba> http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/5/
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:11:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:11:22] <robertmaxrees> too much - look at my last link :)
[16:11:37] <robertmaxrees> you can .closest() to the tr and the .find() the input you want.
[16:11:56] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: how should I add jquery in the fiddel?
[16:12:02] <mojtaba> fiddle*
[16:12:02] <robertmaxrees> you already did.
[16:12:12] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/4/
[16:12:55] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: how did you add jqueryui?
[16:13:03] <robertmaxrees> i dropped to 2.0.2 and added it.
[16:13:55] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I see, the version that I chose did not have that option.
[16:14:41] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/6/ basically I want to multiply each price to its input value field. and then add them up
[16:15:19] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:15:29] <robertmaxrees> so use .closest() to find the TR, then find the field you care about.
[16:15:53] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/7/ this will make that MUCH easier.
[16:16:01] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: thanks, I will try it. And I should use each method, right?
[16:16:31] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I will work on it. thank you again.
[16:16:34] <Android0> If I was to to animate a scroll down on keypress event. What would be the best way to do it?  Add $(window).height?
[16:19:01] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[16:21:07] <Android0> robertmaxrees, My bad.  I'm not looking for the best way to do it, I'm not even going to do it. The question was more, if I wanted to could I?
[16:21:25] <robertmaxrees> why would you want to?
[16:21:33] <robertmaxrees> and sure - you'd use scrolltop.
[16:21:41] <Android0> Because...because I could? :|
[16:21:51] <robertmaxrees> always the worst reasoning ;)
[16:22:29] <Android0> Always the best reasoning, has the most unexpected and interesting results :P
[16:22:42] <arc_> there's all kinds of sites now that force an animated scroll to an exact page element on every scroll event
[16:22:45] <arc_> so yeah it's possible
[16:22:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's possible - you use $(window).scrollTop();
[16:22:58] <robertmaxrees> it's just ugly.
[16:23:03] <arc_> i hate when sites do that
[16:23:08] <arc_> i want to scroll myself :|
[16:23:19] <robertmaxrees> "lol you though you knew what you wanted buuut you don't"
[16:26:02] <Android0> Whatever happened to the good old days when the customer was always right
[16:26:20] <robertmaxrees> they are right, they just don't know how to articulate what they want ;)
[16:27:21] <arc_> he did answer you immediately
[16:32:27] <Android0> That's actually a pretty awesome answer lol
[16:44:52] <robertmaxrees> that's one of the most valuable UX/UI lessons i've learned working at the place i'm at now.
[16:45:07] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I tried this: console.log($(this).closest("tr").find("td:nth-child(2)").innerText); but It gives a 28 undefined in the console!!
[16:45:24] <robertmaxrees> .find() the classname yo.
[16:45:34] <robertmaxrees> and it's not innerText
[16:45:36] <robertmaxrees> it's .text()
[16:45:58] <robertmaxrees> jquery objects don't have all the methods and properties as raw dom nodes.
[16:47:29] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I did not assign it a class attribute, but it has a for attribute. can I use that in .find()?
[16:47:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid it.
[16:47:40] <robertmaxrees> use the class.
[16:47:55] <mojtaba> ok
[16:47:57] <robertmaxrees> for isn't for selecting.  and you have multiple elements with the same for value.
[16:51:06] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: Can I use this to assign class to them? 	$("tr td:nth-child(2)").addClass("price");
[16:53:45] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: It worked, now I have $12.34, but how can I convert this to a number (strip $ away?)
[16:55:36] <robertmaxrees> add the classes in your html yo.
[16:55:40] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I will try regex
[16:55:45] <robertmaxrees> and use a regex.
[16:55:46] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: Why?
[16:55:52] <robertmaxrees> because it's semantic.
[16:55:53] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: It is working now
[16:55:55] <robertmaxrees> that text is a price.
[16:56:14] <mojtaba> It is not allowed to add class on the fly?
[16:56:17] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees:
[16:56:18] <robertmaxrees> it's not smart to.
[16:56:37] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: Because of the speed?
[16:56:44] <robertmaxrees> and because it's a price.
[16:56:51] <robertmaxrees> semantic markup.
[16:57:44] <robertmaxrees> also: it doesn't make any sense to assign the class via jquery - in that vase just use the gross nth-child selector.
[16:57:53] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: sorry, could you please explain a little about semantic?
[16:58:35] <robertmaxrees> the html describes its contents.
[16:59:45] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: thx
[17:00:37] <Android0> ahahahaaha
[17:01:20] <Android0> I just opened up imgur as a distraction, http://imgur.com/gallery/TZJ1gK8, burst out laughing.
[17:08:30] <Lencl> is this valid? .on("append") ?
[17:08:33] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:08:43] <robertmaxrees> unless you're emitting an append event somewhere
[17:09:12] <Lencl> yes it's used to detect when $elem is appended
[17:09:30] <robertmaxrees> hold up - appending an element doesn't emit an "append" event automatically.,
[17:09:55] <robertmaxrees> you've have to .trigger('append');
[17:10:03] <Lencl> ah
[17:10:30] <Lencl> and then .trigger() text can be anything?
[17:10:37] <robertmaxrees> .trigger('append')
[17:10:39] <Lencl> meaning, custom like .trigger('blahblah') ?
[17:10:46] <robertmaxrees> you can use any event name you'd like.
[17:10:50] <robertmaxrees> though i'd avoid that route, too.
[17:11:33] <Lencl> ah I see
[17:11:44] <robertmaxrees> just call your logic after you do the append.
[17:12:30] <Lencl> I have another script that's doing the append
[17:12:43] <robertmaxrees> can you edit that script?
[17:12:47] <Lencl> so is there anyway to detect the append?
[17:12:49] <robertmaxrees> because you'll need to.
[17:12:52] <Lencl> without having to trigger
[17:12:53] <Lencl> yes
[17:13:01] <robertmaxrees> edit that script then.
[17:13:11] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'd need a mutationobserver, but IE support is trash.
[17:13:24] <Lencl> ah ok
[17:13:26] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: do you know what is the problem with this? var price = parseFloat(price_text.replace(/[^0-9\.]+/g,""));
[17:13:45] <robertmaxrees> Lencl and you/whoever inherits maintaining that part of the codebase will appreciate making things less confusing.
[17:13:59] <mojtaba> should I use var each time using a variable or just once at declaring it? ( sorry for naive Q)
[17:14:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:14:07] <robertmaxrees> fiddles dude.
[17:14:21] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: it is just one line. :)
[17:14:30] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba i don't know what price_text is.
[17:14:31] <mojtaba> it is syntax
[17:14:36] <robertmaxrees> nor do i know what you're doing.
[17:14:46] <robertmaxrees> theoretically, yes that works.
[17:14:46] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: yes, you are right.
[17:14:48] <mojtaba> ok
[17:15:00] <robertmaxrees> but you're implying there's a problem ;)
[17:15:30] <mojtaba> no, I confirm that you are not aware of what I am doing. I will try to make a fiddle.
[17:17:10] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/8/
[17:17:58] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: I think parseFloat is the problem, but I took it from stackflow.
[17:18:07] <mojtaba> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/559112/how-to-convert-a-currency-string-to-a-double-with-jquery-or-javascript
[17:22:03] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: Did you have time to take a look at it?
[17:26:33] <robertmaxrees> one sec yo.
[17:28:03] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: check this one http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/9/
[17:28:34] <robertmaxrees> way ahead of you.
[17:28:36] <robertmaxrees> this is simple.
[17:28:48] <robertmaxrees> scope.
[17:29:38] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: so should I define var total=0 inside the function?
[17:29:40] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:29:46] <robertmaxrees> because that'll reset on every iteration.
[17:29:49] <robertmaxrees> drop the var on total.
[17:29:50] <mojtaba> yes
[17:29:59] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/10/
[17:30:22] <robertmaxrees> i would check out doing this with a .map() instead.
[17:30:49] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: thanks. sorry for asking this naive questoins. Today is my first time of using fiddle and jquery.
[17:30:53] <robertmaxrees> it
[17:30:56] <robertmaxrees> *it's fine.
[17:31:02] <robertmaxrees> and why haven't you added the price calss?
[17:31:05] <robertmaxrees> you have a description class.
[17:31:30] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: that one is for <p>, I just want to change its color and size later.
[17:31:42] <robertmaxrees> it'll make things much more readable.
[17:31:43] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:32:41] <mojtaba> What was .map()?
[17:32:57] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:32:59] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you.
[17:33:02] <mojtaba> thx
[17:33:17] <drej> lol
[17:33:28] <mojtaba> drej: ?
[17:33:29] <drej> kabab place ordering menu, guy's from kitchener
[17:33:30] <drej> classic
[17:33:45] <mojtaba> drej: Are you from kitchener?

[17:34:00] <mojtaba> drej: Are you Persian?
[17:34:05] <drej> nah
[17:34:11] <mojtaba> :)
[17:36:02] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/gg2cmwok/11/
[17:36:48] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: Thanks I will check it.
[17:37:13] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: It is not working as expected
[17:37:43] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting?
[17:37:52] <robertmaxrees> oh hah yeah.
[17:38:04] <mojtaba> multiplying prices to the quantity and the add them up
[17:38:07] <robertmaxrees> you need to multiply each by the number selected.
[17:38:08] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[17:38:23] <robertmaxrees> should be able to fix that yourself :)
[17:38:39] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: yes, thanks
[17:47:38] <Android0> oh god. mojtaba are you coding for a production website?
[17:48:21] <mojtaba> Android0: It is a test server.http://www.kabobhutcanada.com/test11/form-menu
[17:50:07] <drej> you're building an online ordering system
[17:50:10] <drej> from scratch?
[17:50:17] <Android0> That...that...that's not a test a server...
[17:50:31] <mojtaba> drej: I am just making a simple form.
[17:50:33] <Android0> While it's live, on the internet
[17:50:44] <mojtaba> I was not happy with the current form makers with joomla
[17:51:02] <mojtaba> Android0: You can surf other pages.
[17:51:21] <Android0> mojtaba. That is NOT a test server
[17:51:59] <robertmaxrees> mojtaba you should really consider hiring somebody.
[17:52:10] <Android0> yh
[17:52:12] <Android0> yhyhyhyh
[17:52:15] <Android0> Do that, please.
[17:52:19] <mojtaba> I am learning and making things.
[17:52:45] <mojtaba> I didn't want to bother you robertmaxrees. I am really learing.
[17:52:58] <robertmaxrees> which is fine, but you really want somebody with experience to build this form out.
[17:53:10] <mojtaba> If you find this voilating the forums policies, I will not ask.
[17:53:11] <robertmaxrees> are you planning on taking credit cards on this form?
[17:53:21] <drej> mojtaba: its not so much that anyone's opposed to you learning
[17:53:26] <Android0> mojtaba, we honestly do understand that but you're going to be liable for a hell of a lot of damages
[17:53:32] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: No. I just want to email the form.
[17:53:50] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd just hire somebody to build you what you really want in that case.
[17:53:58] <drej> they're just concerned that if you are building this with the intent to collect money and have an online ordering process, that there are lots of things you're likely overlooking
[17:54:00] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're going to have all sorts of weird problems.
[17:54:06] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: :) but I want to learn. :)
[17:54:07] <drej> which will not only lose you customers, but will get you into legal trouble
[17:54:19] <drej> however, if you're not planning on ever using this form to actual accept orders
[17:54:21] <drej> then its all good
[17:54:50] <mojtaba> no, all the thing that I am going to do is to email the completed form
[17:54:53] <mojtaba> just this
[17:55:03] <robertmaxrees> then when it breaks, you'll have very unhappy customers :)
[17:55:22] <drej> mojtaba: are you collecting any payment information on the form?
[17:55:28] <drej> credit card info or similar
[17:55:48] <mojtaba> drej: no
[17:55:59] <drej> what about personally identifiable information
[17:56:00] <drej> (PII)
[17:56:02] <mojtaba> just name and email and address, which is optional
[17:56:06] <drej> like their name/address/etc
[17:56:09] <robertmaxrees> wait why do you have an online order form then?
[17:56:10] <drej> phone number
[17:56:12] <Android0> So how is it a
[17:56:20] <Android0> nevermind robertmaxrees beat me to it
[17:57:20] <robertmaxrees> anybody could put in an order for some crazy amount and then you can't charge them until they show up - people are jerks and would abuse this.
[17:57:43] <mojtaba> robertmaxrees: that is why phone is not optional
[17:57:55] <robertmaxrees> but i didn't want to call you.
[17:57:57] <robertmaxrees> sooo...
[17:58:02] <mojtaba> :)
[17:58:05] <robertmaxrees> you're basically giving me no reason to use online order.
[17:58:09] <mojtaba> I will call you. :
[17:58:15] <drej> but why use online order then
[17:58:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:58:23] <drej> people order online because they dont want to talk to anyone
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> I want to put in the order, show up, and leave.
[17:58:40] <robertmaxrees> not put in the order, have you call me, wait, etc.
[17:58:53] <drej> are you on wordpress mojtaba ?
[17:59:01] <robertmaxrees> you're in good hands - i'm out.
[17:59:03] <robertmaxrees> peace.
[17:59:09] <mojtaba> drej: joomla
[17:59:28] <mojtaba> I will come back (10 min)
[17:59:59] <mojtaba> learning is the most important part for me. (I have started learning jquery. This is my first day. :) )
[18:00:06] <Android0> omg
[18:00:34] <drej> mojtaba: why not do some reading / tutorials first
[18:00:44] <drej> instead of doing something that's going to negatively impact your (im guessing parents) business ?
[18:00:55] <drej> and then, when you've learned some things, come back to that
[18:02:24] <Android0> mojtaba have you considered just-eat and alternatives?  I'm sure it will have a far wider reach than your website and thus will attract more customer, more money etc
[18:07:48] <pyCasso> im having issues returning the body section of a page loaded via ajax
[18:07:52] <pyCasso> https://bpaste.net/show/9b1119543bc7
[18:09:28] <mojtaba> dudes, this is not my website, just one of my friends asked me if I can help him to make a form. Just this
[18:09:31] <mojtaba> :)
[18:13:11] <Android0> What's the difference between ('.class') and ('class)
[18:14:31] <tw2113> assuming you typo'd on the last single quote
[18:14:46] <tw2113> the difference would be the first is looking for the word "class" as a class attribute
[18:14:53] <tw2113> and the 2nd would assume "class" is a tag
[18:22:24] <Android0> Yh, it was my bad.  Thanks for clearing that up
[19:48:51] <Zeranoe> Please tell me jquery has an easier way to preform this simple two button toggle? http://jsbin.com/zerotiduyu/edit?html,output
[19:53:31] <rcyr> You'd normally use what's appropriate in HTML to do that... radio buttons.
[19:56:23] <Zeranoe> rcyr: I need to be able to style the buttons depending on the checked state. I'm also not submitting a form but running some background AJAX when either is selected/unselected
[19:57:56] <rcyr> Zeranoe: Where's the JS in that: http://jsfiddle.net/cmfLb4wb/
[19:58:18] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Again though, this isn't a form
[19:58:53] <rcyr> Then replace <form> with <div> or <lol>
[19:58:59] <Zeranoe> And I need to be able to uncheck one by clicking a checked one again
[20:08:16] <rcyr> Zeranoe: Ha, let me check
[20:14:16] <mojtaba> Does anybody know how can I prevent an input to change its value? (I have made it readonly, but it is still possible to change its value using arrows)
[20:14:41] <kegster> anyone use parallax? found this http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/ -- the demo page has multiple parallax but i don't see how it initiates the parallax on this i attempt to do multiple parallax and have issues
[20:14:49] <rcyr> Zeranoe: I tried to compress it as much as possible: http://jsfiddle.net/cmfLb4wb/1/
[20:14:54] <rcyr> Zeranoe: Is that good?
[20:17:15] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Interesting...
[20:18:28] <rcyr> Zeranoe: The advantage is that you can add more buttons: http://jsfiddle.net/cmfLb4wb/2/
[20:18:39] <Zeranoe> rcyr: I like the solution, but could it work with variable container names? http://jsfiddle.net/cmfLb4wb/3/
[20:20:01] <rcyr> Zeranoe: Change it a bit: http://jsfiddle.net/cmfLb4wb/4/
[20:20:10] <rcyr> I didn't know about your use-case
[20:20:27] <rcyr> Zeranoe: The two groups should be separate now
[20:20:53] <Zeranoe> I looks like they are
[20:21:29] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Do I need to list all the containers?
[20:21:45] <rcyr> Zeranoe: Unless you use a "common class", yes.
[20:21:47] <Zeranoe> (obviosuly I do for this case, but can it be done without that)
[20:21:48] <mojtaba> Does anybody know how can I prevent an input to change its value? (I have made it readonly, but it is still possible to change its value using mouse or keyboard)
[20:22:13] <rcyr> Zeranoe: http://jsfiddle.net/cmfLb4wb/5/
[20:23:22] <bango> mojaba why not convert the input into a span or something
[20:23:27] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Well done, I like that. What is the state checking you are doing?
[20:24:01] <mojtaba> bango: because it depends on the value of the other field, if it is satisfied, it should be enabled.
[20:24:24] <rcyr> Zeranoe: Instead of checking for the presence of "classes" on the elements, I add the current "state" as data to the container
[20:24:30] <rcyr> Zeranoe: Hmm, I have a bug I think.
[20:24:46] <bango> mojtaba have you heard of select2?
[20:25:02] <mojtaba> bango: no. what is it?
[20:25:12] <bango> https://select2.github.io/
[20:25:28] <rcyr> Zeranoe: Sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/cmfLb4wb/7/
[20:25:45] <rcyr> Zeranoe: Made the code a bit shorter at the same time..
[20:26:06] <mojtaba> bango: Do you know any solution without using select2?
[20:26:34] <bango> i can think of hacks for it
[20:26:58] <mojtaba> bango: http://www.kabobhutcanada.com/test11/form-menu
[20:27:03] <Zeranoe> rcyr: From here I should be able to pass along the $(this).parent().attr("id") along with if it is a left or right button to AJAX?
[20:27:16] <Zeranoe> rcyr: I haven't used data-state
[20:27:22] <mojtaba> the gray ones are readonly and if you increase the box above it, it becomes normal
[20:27:44] <mojtaba> bango: but you are still able to change its value (although it is readonly)
[20:27:47] <rcyr> Zeranoe Sure.
[20:28:04] <Zeranoe> rcyr: It does look like that is HTML5... Which I love, but I'm not so sure IE 9 does
[20:28:19] <bango> mojtaba find the call to increment in the jquery and, idk add a parameter that says return false if this value is true... get me?
[20:28:22] <rcyr> Zeranoe: IE9 has a HTML5 parser, don't worry.
[20:28:42] <mojtaba> bango: could you please explain a little?
[20:28:52] <rcyr> Zeranoe: It even works on IE8 because IE has been supporting expando attributes since like... IE6
[20:28:56] <bango> when you click the up or down button, a functino is called
[20:29:04] <bango> jquery function that can be added to perhaps
[20:29:09] <mojtaba> bango: how can I find it?
[20:29:21] <bango> give me a sec i can snoop
[20:29:29] <mojtaba> bango: thx
[20:29:36] <rcyr> Zeranoe: With alerts: http://jsfiddle.net/cmfLb4wb/8/
[20:29:47] <rcyr> Zeranoe: To show how to fetch the idea + state
[20:29:59] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Got a null state there
[20:30:13] <rcyr> Zeranoe: null state is when nothing is selected
[20:30:19] <Zeranoe> rcyr: nvm, null must be unchecked
[20:30:32] <Zeranoe> rcyr: This is awesome
[20:30:52] <bango> mojtaba view page source line 614
[20:30:53] <rcyr> Zeranoe: So, just change line 15 with whatever you need
[20:30:58] <rcyr> (The alert())
[20:31:03] <Zeranoe> Yup
[20:31:22] <mojtaba> bango: ok
[20:31:34] <mojtaba> bango: I added them
[20:31:41] <bango> what did you add?
[20:31:58] <mojtaba> bango: line 614-619
[20:32:00] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Is data-state pretty popular now?
[20:32:27] <bango> i know thats what i pointed you to, but you said you added something mojtaba
[20:32:32] <rcyr> Zeranoe: You can add as many data-whatever attributes as you want. They're standard. They're also popular.
[20:32:57] <mojtaba> bango: no I mean I added those lines to get this functionality
[20:33:01] <rcyr> Zeranoe: As long as you prefix them with data-, you're fine.
[20:33:43] <bango> yes well you can continue to work in those lines to get the desired results. I can't type in the box but i can increment the spinner. is that what you're talking about? mojtaba
[20:34:14] <mojtaba> bango: yes, but I want to prevent it from incrementing the values
[20:34:26] <mojtaba> when it is in readonly mode
[20:34:33] <bango> good were on the same page
[20:34:41] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Not sure what you mean? Like <button data-group="vars"></button> or something?
[20:35:01] <rcyr> Zeranoe: That's valid
[20:35:26] <rcyr> <button data-foo="10" data-bar="20" data-baz="30">Foo</button> is valid
[20:35:29] <mojtaba> bango: I don't know what do to though. :-P
[20:35:41] <bango> yeah im thinking about it
[20:35:54] <bango> like you want to destroy a spinner() call
[20:36:04] <mojtaba> bango: yes
[20:36:53] <mojtaba> bango: but it should have normal capability of the spinner after getting enabled
[20:37:11] <bango> mojtaba the hack i was taking about earlier would be to set the spinner display:none
[20:37:19] <Zeranoe> rcyr: That seems a lot better than onclick="". Is that ill advised with jquery?
[20:37:56] <mojtaba> bango: if you click on it you can also rise it using up arrow key too
[20:37:56] <bango> you can just manipulate the css so it essentially disappears as a UI element altogether
[20:38:05] <rcyr> Zeranoe: You should never use onwhatever="" attributes, they're inflexible (only a single handler can be added that way), they mix behavior (JS) with presentation (HTML)
[20:38:17] <bango> mojtaba the arrow key is the only way to add input to it?
[20:38:23] <bango> if readonly
[20:38:45] <mojtaba> bango: no you can add by up arrow key. Just click on it.
[20:38:52] <bango> aaaah
[20:38:55] <bango> now i read you
[20:39:07] <Zeranoe> Thanks rcyr, been very helpful
[20:39:28] <mojtaba> bango: I don't want to disappear it completely
[20:39:30] <bango> $( ".selector" ).spinner( "destroy" );
[20:39:39] <bango> youve got your destroy
[20:39:41] <mojtaba> bango: let me try that
[20:40:57] <mojtaba> bango: cannot call methods on spinner prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'destroy'
[20:41:01] <mojtaba> What should I do?
[20:41:12] <bango> ok add it to that document.ready function
[20:41:19] <bango> after you call them
[20:41:25] <bango> can i just refresh to see the code?
[20:41:42] <mojtaba> bango: I put it in the if section of the funciton
[20:41:53] <mojtaba> I will put it now in the document.ready section
[20:41:54] <mojtaba> wait
[20:42:40] <mojtaba> bango: Yep, it is working. but it should be conditional
[20:43:00] <bango> good deal. can you make it conditional?
[20:43:31] <mojtaba> bango: I have the function disablePrice, can I put it there/
[20:43:40] <mojtaba> It says it needs initialization though.
[20:44:00] <mojtaba> bango: let me try it
[20:44:07] <bango> no since youre calling disable price immediately
[20:44:27] <bango> you need to have an onchange event on some input that determines whether disabled or not
[20:44:29] <mojtaba> bango: I will change their order
[20:46:16] <mojtaba> bango: I changed spin() and disablePrice() and also put that line in the disablePrice function.
[20:46:32] <mojtaba> bango: but the question is that how can enable it ?
[20:46:39] <mojtaba> re-enable*
[20:47:24] <mojtaba> bango: should I add spin() in the else section of the disablePrice()?
[20:47:25] <bango> the same $() you used to .spinner("destroy"), use to .spinner()
[20:47:41] <mojtaba> bango: oh. o
[20:47:42] <mojtaba> k
[20:47:49] <bango> no mojtaba, that would re-call the spinner for all the ones that were already unaffected
[20:48:02] <mojtaba> bango: ok, let me try it.
[20:50:38] <mojtaba> bango: it seems it is working, but still gives me the same error
[20:51:01] <bango> im getting no console errors, what do i have to do to make them change
[20:51:55] <mojtaba> change the box above it
[20:52:04] <bango> yes mojtaba you're mistake I think is in calling everything as functions in that document.ready function
[20:52:21] <bango> instead, some of those functions you call should be input onchange functions
[20:52:49] <bango> tell me this, when do you want the inputs disabled?
[20:52:53] <bango> in what cases
[20:52:56] <mojtaba> bango: for input onchange I have spinchange
[20:53:26] <mojtaba> bango: When the value of its above field is 0 it should be disabled, otherwise it should be enabled.
[20:53:43] <bango> ok, so your first problem is that call to spin()
[20:53:45] <mojtaba> bango: just for two of them
[20:54:06] <bango> becayse that will initialize every single one, and the values are all 0
[20:54:09] <mojtaba> bango: spin() just initiate all of them
[20:54:34] <mojtaba> bango: yes, and after that disablePrice() will fix them.
[20:55:04] <bango> I would only enable the ones you need at any time, if you need one, create it, if you need one gone delete it
[20:55:20] <bango> let me pseudo code
[20:56:29] <mojtaba> bango: ok, thx
[20:58:57] <furoido> setTimeout(pageReload(), 15000);
[20:59:15] <furoido> this should delay page reload for 15 seconds?
[20:59:21] <furoido> or something is wrong with implmentation
[21:01:48] <bango> mojtaba see if this makes sense
[21:01:48] <bango> http://pastebin.com/Lz7r2crK
[21:01:55] <bango> im going for a smoke, afk 5
[21:02:05] <mojtaba> bango: ok, thx
[21:10:54] <bango> so do you get the gist mojtaba?
[21:11:23] <mojtaba> bango: Actually it does not work. Because I want them all to be enable at the begininning for the user
[21:12:02] <bango> you also want them to be disabled if some values are < 1
[21:12:06] <bango> and they all initialize to 0
[21:12:23] <bango> so you have a conflict of interest there, you see?
[21:12:41] <mojtaba> bango: just two of them should be disabled with 0
[21:13:09] <bango> then the 2 at the beginning wont be initialized until the onchange from the other input tells it its > 0
[21:13:27] <mojtaba> bango: yes, it is better
[21:13:40] <bango> so you see how my pseudo code does that?
[21:13:42] <mojtaba> but how can I distinguish them? all of them have the same class
[21:13:50] <bango> dont use the class
[21:13:55] <bango> you have IDs there right
[21:13:56] <bango> for all of them
[21:14:19] <mojtaba> yes
[21:14:41] <mojtaba> bango: so should I do it one by one? or is it possible to use .each or sth like that?
[21:14:59] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Looking over your example a little more, how come you are comparing the state (which is the container state) to the newState (which is the element state)? I don't even see a data-state on the container
[21:15:27] <bango> you can use the .each, but then youd be doing it by number index, and youd have to know the number index of the ones that wont init at start
[21:15:53] <bango> and the number index of those whos onchange() event will trigger it
[21:16:07] <mojtaba> bango: Is there any better way of doing it?
[21:16:33] <bango> each() more efficient, harder to read, #ids, much easier to read, clear and easier to control
[21:17:05] <bango> a C++ programmer would use the each(), a visual designer would use #ids you might say
[21:17:57] <mojtaba> bango: I see. thanks. I will try it.
[21:18:18] <bango> or just run the .each, initialize all of them, then in watch, disable the ones that need disabled
[21:18:24] <bango> mojtaba
[21:18:44] <mojtaba> bango: yes, this one is better
[21:18:47] <rcyr> Zeranoe: THere's no state initially, but I add one after the first click.
[21:18:50] <bango> ++1
[21:19:38] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Weird, I see the code there, but it isn't changing for me while inspecting it
[21:19:50] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Working though
[21:20:13] <mojtaba> bango: I am using the same technique I guess http://paste.ubuntu.com/11834230/
[21:20:28] <rcyr> Zeranoe: The data attributes are only "initial data", they don't represent the current state.
[21:20:40] <mojtaba> bango: But it has some problems. (It is not working as expected :-P)
[21:22:09] <mojtaba> bango: could you please take a look at it to see what is wrong with it?
[21:22:34] <bango> yeah looking, i see youre getting errors but the main thing is, it will enable but not disable again right?
[21:23:40] <Zeranoe> rcyr: So I don't screw this up: if I have another div inside the container that I want to modify the <text> of, should I select that element with: container.children('.div-class') ?
[21:24:04] <mojtaba> bango: It monitors and then disable again.
[21:24:23] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Sorry, thats the text() of
[21:25:18] <mojtaba> bango: my first if-else executes, but the second one does not execute! (in the disablePrice function)
[21:26:10] <bango> alert after the first if else to see youre still there
[21:27:09] <mojtaba> bango: ok, thx
[21:27:22] <mojtaba> bango: wait
[21:27:26] <bango> instead of this line $("#Koobideh_Kabob_extra").spinner("destroy");
[21:27:55] <bango> try using the $('.class')[4] or whatever number it comes out to be
[21:28:14] <bango> .foods
[21:29:57] <mojtaba> bango: but that id is more specific!
[21:30:25] <bango> i know, but its not seeing an initialized spinner under that ID
[21:30:28] <bango> and throwing the error'
[21:30:47] <bango> and you called spinner from the class each
[21:31:16] <bango> in spin()
[21:31:29] <mojtaba> bango: The previous problem fixed by adding ; after each else.
[21:31:41] <bango> wait wait
[21:31:48] <bango> ok so you also need to check in the ifs
[21:31:54] <bango> if there is an active spinner
[21:32:08] <bango> else it will keep trying to destroy something thats not there after it destroyed it the first time successfully
[21:32:09] <mojtaba> What should I do?
[21:32:52] <mojtaba> bango: sorry I did not understand
[21:33:16] <bango> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5670048/jquery-how-to-check-if-a-plugin-has-already-been-applied-to-a-div
[21:34:32] <bango> if you enable a spinner, give it class applied. then you can check in the if (value >0 and hasclass(applied))
[21:35:12] <mojtaba> bango: you mean in the if statement I should check for the class too?
[21:36:19] <bango> the if statement checks if <1. but if <1, and already disabled, the destroy call will throw an error.
[21:36:35] <bango> so you need to know if a spinner has already been disabled
[21:36:59] <bango> if you add a class of enabled to each spinner you init, you can check in that if
[21:37:07] <mojtaba> bango: first I call spin() which enables all. then disablePrice() will disable those two, right?
[21:37:10] <bango> if (<1 and hasclass(enabled))
[21:37:21] <bango> correct
[21:37:56] <bango> in spin, below spinner call, do foods.addclass(applied)
[21:38:19] <bango> then everywhere you do a spinner destroy, remove class applied
[21:38:40] <bango> then in the if, you check if its applied, and if its not, dont bother destroying something that doesnt exist
[21:38:51] <mojtaba> bango: sorry could u please show me the code, I am a bit confused
[21:43:29] <bango> http://pastebin.com/Vb3t9knh
[21:44:17] <rcyr> Zeranoe: You would use container.find('.div-class').text('foo')
[21:44:39] <bango> afk 5
[21:44:55] <mojtaba> bango: thx, I am checking it
[21:46:21] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Why not children?
[21:46:41] <rcyr> Zeranoe: children is for "direct children"
[21:46:57] <Zeranoe> rcyr: It would be in this case
[21:47:47] <rcyr> Zeranoe: If you ever have to.. let's say, add a wrapper between your container and the buttons, with children, it's going to break but not with find
[21:48:26] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Is there a performance benefit to using children since it isn't searching all over for it?
[21:48:27] <rcyr> So, I advocate the usage of find instead of children for that purpose...  the same way I would advise using .closest() instead of .parent
[21:48:41] <rcyr> Zeranoe: Negligible.
[21:51:27] <bango> mojtaba how goes it
[21:51:59] <mojtaba> bango: It seems better now, but it still has a problem. Just try to increase second and fourth boxes and then third and fifth boxes. When you decrease to 0 the first boxes the fifth box does not disable.
[21:52:08] <uncovery> hey everyone, my lightbox setup is not working, can someone help me find out what's wrong? http://uncovery.net/hkrocks/?date=2010-03-23
[21:54:40] <mojtaba> bango: did you see that?
[21:55:03] <bango> yeah i see a console error im checking
[21:57:01] <someone`> Hello
[21:58:09] <bango> class applied is not getting removed in the if
[21:58:43] <mojtaba> bango: how come?
[21:58:53] <bango> erm...
[22:00:00] <d3m0n> I am running into a problem where I have a function checking if a class is added via key input but it can only fire off after the second keystroke because it doesn't know it added it already. How would I go about fixing this?
[22:00:19] <d3m0n> I.e I have two keydown functions and the second one depends on the first
[22:00:36] <d3m0n> But I'd like them to check and fire off at the same time
[22:02:26] <mojtaba> bango: The removeClass is there, may be if does not execute?
[22:03:55] <bango> mojtaba http://pastebin.com/1BXQ9iyV
[22:04:21] <mojtaba> bango: What have you added?
[22:04:29] <bango> the elses are now else if
[22:05:04] <mojtaba> bango: let me try that
[22:07:02] <someone`> I want to make a sidebar dragable into a content container then, elements droped into container
[22:07:07] <someone`> to be dragable inside it
[22:07:07] <someone`> http://jsfiddle.net/96t0qwmg/
[22:07:15] <bango> also mojtaba this is stray text at the bottom of the page $("input").prop('disabled', false);
[22:07:17] <someone`> but have no luck :)
[22:07:32] <mojtaba> bango: I will remove it
[22:07:36] <someone`> i added after droppable $('.fw-content li').draggable();
[22:07:46] <someone`> to make them dragable but seems not work like that
[22:08:33] <someone`> anyone have a ideea how to fix this please?
[22:08:53] <mojtaba> bango: Still the same prolem
[22:08:57] <mojtaba> problem*
[22:10:29] <bango> mojtaba it seems like mini koobideh is triggering it
[22:10:31] <bango> ?
[22:11:11] <mojtaba> bango: Joojeh Kabob triggers it
[22:11:28] <bango> hahaha mojtaba it doesnt register the onchange until you click outside it again
[22:12:16] <bango> id just stick with the onchange event instead of the on(spinchange)
[22:12:59] <mojtaba> bango: so should I change the spinchange with onchange?
[22:13:22] <bango> on("spinchange", updatePrice); to .change(disablePrice);

[22:14:31] <mojtaba> bango: should I replace every instance of spinchange with onchange or just that line?
[22:14:51] <bango> all the ones in your document ready function
[22:15:25] <mojtaba> bango: and I should change 'on' to 'change', right?
[22:15:37] <bango> and remove spinchange
[22:15:49] <mojtaba> bango: ok, let me try it
[22:15:51] <bango> wait
[22:15:57] <bango> you also have foods .change
[22:16:03] <bango> for update price
[22:16:16] <bango> so you dont need update price call for those IDs
[22:17:23] <mojtaba> bango: It is not working
[22:17:45] <mojtaba> bango: does not even enable it
[22:17:49] <bango> ok, now it works if you type only
[22:18:07] <bango> and then click out of it
[22:18:16] <mojtaba> only?
[22:18:20] <mojtaba> where should I put it
[22:18:39] <bango> ok, the change event was a bad idea
[22:19:01] <mojtaba> bango: should I change it back to on?
[22:19:04] <bango> the way you had it is fine, but still take out updateprice call for those IDs
[22:19:11] <bango> yes mojtaba
[22:19:41] <mojtaba> bango: The problem is that, I want the total price being updated if those prices are removed.
[22:20:15] <bango> so no matter what you do, youre spinchange calling on foods, so youre updating price every time you press an up or down
[22:20:39] <mojtaba> bango: ok. I will remove them
[22:23:17] <mojtaba> bango: The problem is just with the second box. I do not know what is wrong, because we are using the same rationale for both of them and the first is working, but the second one is not working!!!
[22:23:27] <bango> i see that too moj
[22:25:13] <bango> mojtaba, try switching those if else blocks
[22:25:22] <mojtaba> bango: ok
[22:25:23] <bango> see what crazy shit happens
[22:25:24] <mojtaba> wait
[22:26:35] <bango> they both work now??
[22:27:07] <mojtaba> bango: It is odd!!! They are working now, but still the second one gives same error
[22:27:14] <bango> not for me
[22:27:35] <mojtaba> bango: try changing joojeh kabob and below it
[22:27:39] <bango> i select 1 joojeh and the joojeh extra is available
[22:28:10] <mojtaba> bango: yes, now 0 joojeh kabob will trigger the error
[22:29:18] <bango> they still have class applied
[22:30:04] <bango> shoot... change all instances of enabled to applied
[22:30:21] <bango> because i am dumb and dont maintain consistent nomenclature
[22:31:10] <mojtaba> bango: you mean applied to enabled?
[22:31:32] <bango> nope i was mistaken. enabled isnt being added as a class to them anywhere is it
[22:31:48] <mojtaba> bango: no I have just applied
[22:35:06] <bango> so you see the problem is that class isnt getting removed
[22:35:29] <bango> so youre getting console errors, but as far as i can tell things work in the UI
[22:35:33] <bango> mjotaba
[22:36:03] <mojtaba> bango: yes, it is working in the UI, but it still gives error. That is really odd!
[22:36:13] <mojtaba> We have used the same reasoning!
[22:36:20] <bango> good deal
[22:36:24] <bango> im going to bed lol
[22:36:36] <mojtaba> bango: Thank you very much
[22:36:41] <bango> np goodnight
[22:36:45] <mojtaba> bango: I really appreciate your time. good night
[22:44:19] <Abhijit> hi
[22:44:42] <Abhijit> I am confused between click toggle and hide/show toggle? both look same. i tried to write one for click toggle and it hides my element?
[23:08:14] <Abhijit> how can I capture "change" of $('body').width(); event?
[23:13:04] <d3m0n> Anyone know if it
[23:13:22] <d3m0n> it's possible to run a success function inside individual elememnts for the jquery validations*
[23:17:31] <mdev> foreach maybe
[23:23:42] <Cork> Abhijit: the resize event
[23:23:52] <Cork> though it is for the window not the body
[23:24:15] <Abhijit> yes. window resize do not wo0k.
[23:24:18] <Abhijit> work*
[23:24:35] <Cork> then you don't have any event you can use
[23:25:28] <Abhijit> ok
[23:40:25] <hellyeah> hey
[23:42:52] <hellyeah> anyone awake
[23:43:53] <hellyeah> i wonder second pop up window is not positioned properly when i do position:"absolute" it will apear under the first pop up window but i want them appear exactly like that with proper positioning any suggestion? http://jsfiddle.net/cmhmb34j/3/
[23:45:22] <Cork> hellyeah: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[23:45:33] <Cork> position isn't what you thin it is
[23:46:13] <hellyeah> humm
[23:47:28] <Max-P> hellyeah: .dialog() doesn't take CSS. It takes a list of options. position doesn't do what you think, and both "margin" and "padding" doesn't exist at all.
[23:47:46] <hellyeah> ic
[23:48:33] <Cork> nor top or left
[23:48:44] <Max-P> If you want to set the style of your dialog, use $(...).css({yourcss}).dialog({dialogOptions});
[23:48:52] <Cork> no
[23:48:57] <Cork> set it in the css file
[23:48:59] <Cork> not in js
[23:49:47] <Max-P> Cork: Sometimes there are cases where you want to do it in JS, but yeah of course better just put it into the stylesheet
[23:50:02] <Cork> sure, there are a minute few cases
[23:50:16] <Cork> but with css calc those have gotten cut down by 2/3
[23:50:30] <Cork> so basically, no
[23:50:43] <Cork> no need for setting css in js
[23:51:37] <hellyeah> i am kinda newbie
[23:51:42] <hellyeah> thanks for link
[23:51:54] <hellyeah> do i have right top
[23:51:59] <hellyeah> right button
[23:52:05] <Max-P> Anyway, setting position: absolute on the dialog is probably a bad idea on its own. jQuery already handles the ordering itself, no need to change that
[23:52:37] <hellyeah> i got it
[23:53:44] <hellyeah> well this link looks handy
[23:53:46] <hellyeah> https://jqueryui.com/position/
[23:55:21] <hellyeah> you know what collision does
[23:55:34] <hellyeah> there is collision here https://jqueryui.com/position/
[23:57:42] <Max-P> hellyeah: http://api.jqueryui.com/position/ "When the positioned element overflows the window in some direction, move it to an alternative position. "
[23:58:32] <Max-P> I think that's useful for say, tooltips where if the tooltip would appear outside of the window, then open it the other way so it's visible.
[23:58:37] <hellyeah> ic that seems good btw http://jsfiddle.net/cmhmb34j/5/
[23:58:39] <hellyeah> check it out
[23:59:54] <hellyeah> i see wht collision is remembered the meaning
