[04:14:29] <pippuccio76> hi at all , sorry for english , i have i form with dinamic select get from ajax, i must validate the form by javascript .Because some field must be required depends by a select , how can i validate ?
[04:16:42] <Woet> by writing the code to do so?
[04:19:11] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/ahn9wLk0/
[04:19:24] <pippuccio76> but the select are dinamic
[04:21:10] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/ahn9wLk0/1/
[04:23:25] <Woet> pippuccio76: so write an if that checks the select value.
[04:23:45] <Woet> pippuccio76: and you know thats massive amounts of duplicate codes you can avoid right?
[04:24:52] <pippuccio76> i want write code by ajax , but can i insert a code inside a function dinamically ?
[04:25:57] <Woet> pippuccio76: you could add classes that you bind on or use HTML5 validation
[04:28:34] <pippuccio76> the js code is inside a function , when i submit the form i run the function , i must insert code inside a function depends on the select
[04:29:50] <Woet> pippuccio76: yes, you mentioned that.

[15:46:54] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> hi all
[15:47:59] <jak2000> hi all
[15:48:40] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/aznvcLps/134/   <-when user press YES button and then press NO button, i want unckeck the YES button (change the state), how do this?
[15:56:23] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> it's the label which gets the blue color
[15:56:54] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> jak2000 - so you should change the class of the label I bet
[16:10:50] <jak2000> jOhan-1-9-7-7 how to?
[16:11:45] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> if you look in your example (chrome - inspect) - the color of the label is given by the class "active"
[16:12:49] <jak2000> i am on F12
[16:13:04] <jak2000> on chrome...
[16:13:24] <jak2000> now where i see the label class?
[16:16:43] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> right-click on the button and choose 'inspect' (I think - my chrome is in dutch)
[16:17:19] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> it will take you to the html - if you click your label you will see that it adds and removes an "active" class
[16:19:43] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> also the checkbox never gets checked I think
[16:20:32] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> when you click the label
[16:21:13] <shoky_> jOhan-1-9-7-7: just use radios instead of checkboxes.. http://jsfiddle.net/aznvcLps/135/
[16:21:32] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> shoky_ it's not for me :-)
[16:21:59] <shoky_> oops, jak2000 then
[16:22:28] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> but I understand :-)
[16:22:38] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> i didn't think about the checkboxes
[16:30:19] <jak2000> see my jquery
[16:30:21] <jak2000> code
[16:32:11] <jak2000> if shoky_: http://jsfiddle.net/aznvcLps/136/
[16:32:16] <jak2000> :( not display an alert.....
[16:32:18] <jak2000> why?
[16:32:21] <jak2000> wich s wrong
[16:33:00] <jak2000> ?
[16:33:08] <shoky_> jak2000: use change event instead of click
[16:33:42] <jak2000> how to change the blue color (pressed) for a red? http://jsfiddle.net/aznvcLps/137/
[16:33:55] <shoky_> with css?
[16:34:19] <shoky_> or mayb bootstrap has some class you can add to change the style.. donno
[16:34:25] <jak2000> yes or jquery
[16:34:27] <shoky_> but it's just css, in any case
[16:34:27] <jak2000> no problem
[16:34:28] <jak2000> ok
[16:34:31] <shoky_> no, not jquery
[16:34:53] <jak2000> yes understand is css but can do with inline css :)
[16:34:54] <jak2000> not?
[16:35:00] <shoky_> huh?
[16:35:06] <shoky_> no need for inline css..
[16:36:03] <jak2000> shoky_ jOhan-1-9-7-7 how to know if a div is hidden? i am on chorme at F12(console)
[16:36:09] <jak2000> i am on inspect elemenr
[16:36:52] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> jak2000 you might want to check the different possible buttons from bootstrap
[16:36:54] <shoky_> here's silly example of changing the css, btw..
[16:36:56] <shoky_> http://jsfiddle.net/aznvcLps/138/
[16:37:29] <shoky_> you don't need to know if a div is hidden, probably.. use classes
[16:38:59] <jak2000> ok
[16:39:39] <jak2000> beautiful
[16:39:48] <jak2000> is other different question....
[16:40:03] <jak2000> not display anything on a div, but i am sure it have a value....
[16:40:12] <jak2000> then i think is hidden the div....
[16:50:58] <Flic> Can I buy a real button and connect it to do a jquery script when I push it?
[16:51:41] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> you can
[16:51:59] <jak2000> buy?
[16:52:22] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> with NodeMCU microcontroller and Node.js
[16:53:53] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> Flic - this is probably overkill - but yes, it is possible
[16:53:57] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> Flic - https://www.instructables.com/id/Getting-Started-With-ESP8266LiLon-NodeMCU-V3Flashi/
[16:54:30] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> it is a microcontroller which runs a small node-js webserver
[16:56:41] <Flic> ok, I just need some real basic =)
[16:57:03] <Flic> I looked at https://flic.io/
[16:57:46] <Flic> But dont know if I can code my own stuff
[16:58:03] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> in that case, yes it's possible - no idea how
[17:02:02] <Flic> thx
[17:24:29] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> question: trying to build my own pagination widget for fun
[17:24:31] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> https://jsfiddle.net/j0han_1_9_7_7/obxdydj3/1/
[17:25:08] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> but well... i copied the base from the wiki and I'm wondering whether I am creating the function 'activePage' correctly
[18:03:13] <shoky_> jOhan-1-9-7-7: when you create a widget, it adds a method to jquery objects with the name of your widget (pagination in your case).  and you have to first initialize it e.g. $('#pages').pagination();
[18:03:33] <shoky_> jOhan-1-9-7-7: and to call public methods (after initializing) you do   .pagination('methodName', arguments..)
[18:03:50] <shoky_> jOhan-1-9-7-7: same as jquery-ui widgets
[18:03:57] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> ok thanks
[18:04:10] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> I am devouring the wiki, but it's very new to me
[18:04:14] <shoky_> what wiki?
[18:04:38] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> the learn.jquery pages
[18:04:45] <shoky_> k
[18:04:54] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> prob not a wiki :-)
[18:05:12] <shoky_> just making sure you're not reading some bad tutorial ;p
[18:05:48] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> true :D
[18:06:02] <jOhan-1-9-7-7> thanks - off to bed
[18:06:12] <shoky_> nite
[22:08:44] <asidjazz> can i pass removeClass multiple classes
[22:09:29] <asidjazz> spaces ok
[22:16:44] <d3m0n> Anyone familiar with bxslider plugin? I am curious about the touch swipe function. If I try to swipe on my mobile it's got this weird delay where it follows the speed of my swipe then when I let go it slows down and transitions to the next slide. I'd like the speed to follow through with my swipe.
[22:23:28] <d3m0n> Looks like it might of been the easing causing the problem on touch
