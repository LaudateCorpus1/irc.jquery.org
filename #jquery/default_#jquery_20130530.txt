[00:00:04] <Cork> no
[00:00:14] <aaas> styol yes and indeed there is a Drupal.ajax.prototype.commands and there's ain insert inside so it's been prototyped, but then i see *once again* function (ajax, response, status)
[00:00:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork: let me check.. thanks bro
[00:00:42] <Cork> np
[00:01:09] <aaas> styol so unless this is some prototype or inheretence thing...im just trying to find out where these things come from because i keep seeing them
[00:01:13] <lemonsparrow> Cork: shouldnt this be enough ? <input type="checkbox" name="Lock" align="left" value="${formBean.Lock}"/>
[00:01:25] <Cork> lemonsparrow: forms doens't work like that
[00:01:35] <Cork> an unchecked checkbox returns no value
[00:01:46] <Cork> so you need the hidden one as a fallback
[00:01:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: then ? I mean do I need a hidden field at all to send the checkbox value? how can I keep it as simple as possible ?
[00:01:58] <Cork> the value of the checkbox should be the value of when it's checked
[00:02:16] <Cork> lemonsparrow: what i gave you is as simple as it gets
[00:02:36] <Cork> one value for unchecked, and one value for checked
[00:03:37] <styol> aaas: it's possible they're passed as callbacks to a jquery request, but yeah this one might be interesting to track down
[00:04:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks
[00:04:49] <styol> aaas: ok i see it, line 225
[00:05:29] <styol> aaas: response[i]['command'] is prolly == 'insert' so it ends up this.commands.insert
[00:05:48] <styol> *this.commands.insert(this, response[i], status)
[00:06:31] <aaas> styol hmmm and this defines ajax, or response, or all three?
[00:08:08] <styol> aaas: this passes is Drupal.ajax basically, response and status is received back from $.ajax()
[00:08:58] <styol> aaas: line 126 defines the success callback, and within there its essentially calling Drupal.ajax.success(response, status); which is passed from jquery
[00:09:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/Mshbg/2/ this doesn't even load the parent div block of the form.. nothing is appearing after adding this change
[00:09:43] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you missed the inline if change i said i missed
[00:09:51] <aaas> styol ok...so response and status come from jquery?
[00:09:52] <Cork> the java block
[00:10:05] <styol> aaas: yah and this is the Drupal.ajax instance
[00:10:18] <styol> err, `ajax` is Drupal.ajax
[00:10:26] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you need to return the checked="checked" string to the html string if formBean.Lock is true
[00:10:39] <aaas> styol ok....so if i go into firebug and inspect jquery i shoudl find this stuff
[00:10:45] <aaas> is that right?
[00:11:21] <styol> aaas: yeah. May I ask if you have a specific goal in mind or are you just trying to get learndid
[00:12:16] <mahdi_ja> hi all
[00:12:57] <mahdi_ja> i have problem with this command :
[00:12:58] <mahdi_ja> $('a').attr('title', function(index, previousValue){
[00:12:58] <mahdi_ja>     return previousValue + ' - An external link';
[00:12:58] <mahdi_ja> });
[00:13:26] <aaas> styol actually i do, but this one question keeps bugging me because it is sufficiently different from other languages and it sounds like it has to do with the fact that the jquery object has all this info....im actually trying to grab some json to do a replacment of part of a webpage, but do it with the back button..what makes this hard is the json is generated by drupal..so i have the object just need to find the right way to attach it to t
[00:13:26] <aaas> he back button..well the attaching is fine, what is not easy is to see how to do it with drupal
[00:13:33] <mahdi_ja> i want know how jquery determine value of previousValue and index of function parameter
[00:14:16] <mahdi_ja> these are predefined value or jquery determine these value itself
[00:14:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the below block is something which is existing.. http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/Mshbg/4/ can u make out something from this ?
[00:14:47] <styol> aaas: have you reviewed the Drupal javascript API?
[00:14:49] <Cork> mahdi_ja: $('a').each(function(index) { $(this).attr('title', your_func(index, $(this).attr('title')); });
[00:16:07] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you should take this to a java channel if you need more help with the server code
[00:16:18] <mahdi_ja> Cork, this is real code behind this code ?
[00:16:28] <Cork> mahdi_ja: more or less
[00:16:41] <aaas> styol yeah so i got ajax working fine, i know how to do all that pretty well...but implementing a html5 history 'back button' for ajax elements is the part that isn't obvious
[00:16:42] <Cork> but that is how it determens it
[00:17:23] <aaas> styol and what you were lookign at was basically the javascript api  (at least the js side of it/not php)
[00:17:56] <mahdi_ja> Cork, i want know how jquery determine value of previousValue and use this in function body
[00:18:11] <Cork> mahdi_ja: i just told you
[00:18:28] <Cork> your_func(index, $(this).attr('title')
[00:18:29] <Cork> )
[00:18:49] <Cork> there isn't much determining to it
[00:18:57] <Cork> it just grabs the current value from the dom element
[00:19:49] <styol> aaas: hmm.. if i understand the goal correctly, using html5 history and trying to do a back button would be as simple as calling window.history.back(); or window.go(-1);
[00:20:34] <styol> *window.history.go(-1);
[00:20:35] <xertion> Is there any plugin for changing colors on images in greyscale?
[00:20:38] <xertion> I can't find any.
[00:21:10] <Cork> xertion: you would have to use canvas for that
[00:21:20] <Cork> at least if you want cross browser support
[00:21:26] <xertion> Cork: That's what I'm trying, but I can't solve it...
[00:21:33] <Cork> you can use css filter, but it only works in webkit and gecko
[00:21:49] <mahdi_ja> Cork, thank you.
[00:22:02] <aaas> styol so basically i want to do this: https://github.com/blog/760-the-tree-slider   i can replace the url, i can make the browser navigate backards, what i need to do is to grab the json that drupal provides and use the commands encoded in it to replace part of the html...i have it working from a anchor link because drupal was built for that, but attaching a handler to the back button to use that same json isn't as easy
[00:22:16] <Cork> ?g canvas make image grayscale @ xertion
[00:22:17] <b-ot> xertion: Manifesto - Andrew Morrison → http://andrewmorrison.org/site/?page_id=452
[00:22:19] <bot-t> xertion, Making Image Filters with Canvas - HTML5 Rocks - http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/imagefilters/
[00:26:12] <styol> aaas: the source of the json that drupal is responding is probably coming from somewhere within php, but what commands are encoded in the json? what is the html? I'm familiar with Drupal -- if you're trying to change the output of some html, most commonly it can be templated
[00:27:11] <styol> aaas: what is the callback url of the json with the html that you're trying to alter?
[00:28:47] <Happzz> so $('#x').tablesorter(...) doesn't work after a page is loaded with the back button (latest firefox)
[00:29:02] <Happzz> i tried to fire it again with on pageshow, but that didn't work at all
[00:29:37] <aaas> styol  so here's the json response http://pastebin.com/tS665Nvs  like i said, it works perfectly if i use an anchor and use the drupal ajax framework the way it was intended...what is using the menu callback (which generates this json in a custom way) to modify the page USING the back button
[00:30:44] <aaas> styol you can see the commands at the bottom...insert for example...that ajax.js page i showed you is the handler now im trying to find the right way to code some js that uses that handler to deal with my json
[00:30:49] <aaas> and attach it to the back button
[00:33:04] <mitchdotpro> Anyone here today able to give me a hand with a problem I am having in LESS? I am compiling using Less.app / Codekit and can't seem to get mod(n, n) to work.
[00:35:02] <Cork> mitchdotpro: wrong channel
[00:35:19] <noaXess> morning
[00:35:23] <styol> aaas: Roger. Are you generating JSON that is similar to what the AJAX framework expects? I see some likely requirements. Do you already have access to the Drupal.ajax object in your javascript?
[00:36:11] <aaas> styol the json is generated FROM the framework... so it's a link->menu callback->response function->ajax_deliver() drupal function->json
[00:36:53] <aaas> styol also there's javascript attached to that click that does the handling of the response as far as i can tell.... i do have access to that drupal.ajax object
[00:36:54] <noaXess> i use the jquery plugin eventCalendar: http://www.vissit.com/projects/eventCalendar/ it works fine with json data.. the eventCalender plugin generates links to event details.. now i want, that the links are opened in a fancybox.. do i need modify the js of eventCalendar or is there a trick to add fancyboox to each .eventTitle after eventCalendar is complete loaded?
[00:36:58] <lemonsparrow_> hi'
[00:38:26] <styol> aaas: on line 86 or 87 console.log(base, element, element_settings); and perform the action you know works and see what is being provided to Drupal.ajax() as arguments, replicate, and I think that answers the question? me not sure ;)
[00:39:17] <lemonsparrow> hi
[00:39:28] <noaXess> current code for eventCalendar is this http://paste.ubuntu.com/5715897/
[00:39:31] <styol> aaas: if you need to alter the JSON server side, you would probably need to override the menu callback with hook_menu_alter
[00:40:33] <styol> copy the function to a new function, modify it and alter the menu entries menu callback to point to it
[00:40:55] <anli_> Strange, if I use $.ajax to post instead of  $.post, my array will be passed as a number of foo variables, if I use $.post, it will be foo[] variables
[00:41:06] <aaas> styol thanks thats a good idea...yeah i dont need to alter the JSON...all i need is to pop off the history url from the back button and get the json with the corresponding menu callback
[00:41:10] <anli_> Meaning that mvc will not recognize the array
[00:41:19] <anli_> (when foo[] is used)
[00:41:25] <anli_> Sorry for the confusino
[00:41:25] <anli_> on
[00:42:46] <anli_> How do I select whether arrays are passed as foo=34&foo=76&foo=3434 or foo[]=34&foo[]=76&foo[]=3434
[00:43:19] <anli_> Does "traditional" have something with this to do?
[00:43:55] <styol> aaas: hmm the url you're on presently doesn't necessarily infer what ajax url is returning data though
[00:44:18] <styol> aaas: but yeah its probably element_settings.url that has the ajax url
[00:44:41] <aaas> styol that's ok...i know the callback url...i can parse the url and make the slight change (they both end with the same node id)
[00:45:37] <styol> aaas: ah gotcha, easy enough then.. you gots this :)
[00:46:12] <aaas> styol hopefully...we'll see!
[00:46:15] <aaas> thanks for your help
[00:46:21] <styol> aaas: no problem
[00:46:54] <GoSox> So normally I use display: none; in my css to hide an object, then at a later time, I show it with .slideDown() or something similar. But now I want to change an object that is inline, to display: block. But I also want it hidden so it can be shown later with slideDown().  not sure how to go about this though, since visibility and display type are set by the same property??
[00:47:36] <Cork> GoSox: you should never hide elements with display: none; use .hide() on page load
[00:48:01] <Cork> or at least not to hide elements you plan to later show with javascript
[00:48:36] <GoSox> that seems like a much less efficient way to hide things?
[00:48:55] <Cork> progressive enhancement
[00:49:00] <GoSox> huh?
[00:49:12] <Cork> if you hide it though css and only allow showing it through javascript
[00:49:20] <Cork> it can't be seen without javascript
[00:49:25] <GoSox> correct
[00:49:45] <Cork> so the basic position should be visible, and then hiding it through javascript to allow selective showing
[00:49:55] <Cork> and that is how you solve your original problem too
[00:50:13] <GoSox> but the whole site will fail so epically without javascript enabled/present, that that's kind of a moot point
[00:50:15] <Cork> set display: inline; in the css file; run $(elm).hide(); on page load
[00:50:17] <Cork> and it should work
[00:50:51] <Cork> why, but that is why jquery is constructed the way it is
[00:51:05] <Cork> if you choose to break compatibility it is your choice
[00:54:43] <xertion> When I do console.log(img.width); on my image, I get a long function(i,o){......}. Is this normal? Should it not just return the width in pixels?
[00:55:43] <Cork> yes
[00:55:51] <Cork> jquery width is a function not a variable
[00:55:58] <Cork> do console.log(img.width())
[00:56:22] <xertion> Cork: so in example this one http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9303757/how-to-change-color-of-an-image-using-jquery
[00:56:27] <xertion> canvas.width = img.width; they mean the function?
[00:56:51] <Cork> they prob mean the dom element and not the jquery wrapped one
[00:57:06] <Cork> img[0].width
[00:57:41] <GoSox> Is there a GUI standard for which side, left or right, the 'do action' and 'cancel' buttons go on?
[00:57:47] <GoSox> I feel like cancel should go on the right
[00:57:57] <styol> GoSox: note that elements can have one or more classes. So, you could for instance add and remove a class that alters various properties
[00:58:11] <xertion> I do $(this).find('img').width; where this is the <div> where the img is inside.
[00:58:15] <xertion> Shouldn't that return the DOM element?
[00:59:18] <styol> xertion: without .width it should
[00:59:39] <xertion> styol: I meant the width of the DOM element
[00:59:44] <xertion> and not the jquery function that Cork mentioned.
[01:00:15] <Cork> xertion: add ()
[01:00:24] <styol> xertion: perhaps you meant .width()
[01:00:28] <styol> ah yes
[01:03:16] <Cork> xertion: bascially everything on jquery objects is a function
[01:04:41] <xertion> So, with ctx.drawImage(img ...); i get Type Error where img is $(this).find('img') again.
[01:04:45] <xertion> Is this for the same reason?
[01:04:54] <Cork> yes
[01:05:07] <xertion> So what should I write instead?
[01:05:08] <Cork> $(this).find('img')[0]
[01:05:20] <xertion> Hmm ok.
[01:05:36] <Cork> you should most likely just cache the dom element in a variable and use that
[01:05:37] <styol> it returns an array because it might find more than one img
[01:05:48] <Cork> it doesn't return an array
[01:05:53] <Cork> it return an array like jquery object
[01:05:58] <Cork> *returns
[01:06:19] <xertion> I think you put me on the right path, let's see if I can get this thing working.
[01:13:17] <styol> cork: ah right. just out of curiosity, in that instance is jquery extending Object with prototype?
[01:13:30] <seutje> is there a way to pass an array of deferreds to $.when or something?
[01:13:35] <Cork> no
[01:14:04] <Cork> styol: var a = { length: 0 }; a.prototype = Array.prototype;
[01:14:10] <seutje> I have an object with urls in the value, I'd like to loop over it, initializing ajax calls, do a callback for each (with the data) and then another when they're all done
[01:14:19] <Cork> seutje: apply?
[01:14:38] <seutje> of course!
[01:14:45] <lejocelyn> I'm not sure how to use the response callback from autocomplete from jquery ui; I'd like to offer a specific answer when no object was found matching the term the user entered
[01:14:52] <styol> Cork: oh, makes sense
[01:15:10] <seutje> `hi⁵
[01:15:16] <seutje> hi⁵?
[01:15:19] <seutje> :(
[01:15:41] <Cork> lejocelyn: you would have to use the custom source option (source: function...
[01:15:42] <Cork> )
[01:16:22] <colegatron> good morning
[01:17:02] <xertion> Well, since I updated my selector with [0] I got rid of the errors and the code seem to run. It gets the size of img, it gets the RGB color, it adds RGB to img pixels and it updates img.src. But image color does not change.
[01:17:07] <xertion> Here is the function http://pastebin.com/JEJyyftU
[01:17:13] <Cork> seutje: btw stumbled into this when making an pref for a question here http://jsperf.com/idlookup
[01:17:17] <xertion> So basically it runs through everything, but no change in img color.
[01:17:45] <Cork> seutje: was a bit surprised how horrible multiple id's in a selector was
[01:17:57] <Stephen-B> Hi jQuery peeps
[01:18:41] <Stephen-B> I've got a problem using the validation plugin.  I've created a JSFiddle that works fine, but the problem occurs on my actual page. Strange, can anyone take a look?
[01:18:47] <colegatron> I am just starting with the symfony2 and would like to use some jquerymobile wrapper in the views itself to avoid to develop a pure javascript app and a php rest backend.
[01:18:57] <seutje> Cork: whoa
[01:19:31] <colegatron> does anyonw knows a jquerymobile wrapper?
[01:19:46] <seutje> Cork: I'm surprised qSA is slower than the jQueries
[01:20:05] <Cork> seutje: chrome bug
[01:20:24] <Cork> seutje: firefox is like 16 times faster on qSA
[01:20:24] <seutje> the difference is rather marginal though, but still, didn't expect that
[01:20:27] <xertion> Oh, to continue on my comment, it seems as if the color actually changes but it just go darker and darker the more I change, so on a grey/dark picture cant see difference.
[01:20:51] <xertion> if I change a white picture it change color successfully and then gets darker, darker, darker (even if I change to a brighter color)
[01:22:10] <Cork> xertion: your color math looks wrong
[01:22:57] <Rinthe> is there a problem with the inifinite scrolling loadingimg, loading text, done text options? http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[01:23:40] <Cork> xertion: you want to average the colors not divide them by byte size
[01:24:53] <Cork> seutje: what surprised me the most was how much $('#1-foo').add('#2-foo') differed from document.getElementBy
[01:25:17] <Cork> and then jquery have a fast path for that either way
[01:26:09] <Cork> and it still is 16000000+ vs 90000+
[01:27:17] <Stephen-B> Validation plug-in problem, with the date of birth validation in my form.

[01:30:41] <xertion> Cork: what do you mean by average the colors?
[01:31:02] <Cork> (r + g + b) / 3
[01:31:31] <Cork> (that is how you calculate average)
[01:31:50] <xertion> Yes but you mean take the originalpixel and multiply it with the average of rgb?
[01:32:07] <Cork> no you want to reset the colors to the average
[01:32:15] <Cork> you want to LOSE colors
[01:32:44] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/uafNY3Vb everything works except for those loadingText, donetext, htey'rea all still default. any ideas?
[01:33:37] <xertion> Cork: yea but then you won't have any gradients in the picture, it will just be 1 color. So if you example change color of a picture of a T-shirt, then it will loose all details if you replace ALL Pixels with the same color, right?

[01:35:37] <Cork> xertion: if you keep the three colors separately the image won't be grayscale
[01:35:53] <xertion> I dont want to make it grayscale
[01:36:04] <xertion> I want to ADD color to a greyscale image.
[01:36:15] <Cork> O_o
[01:36:23] <Cork> other way around !?!
[01:36:25] <xertion> I want to have greyscale images in a library, and then let the user be able to add those images to their designs.
[01:36:35] <xertion> and change the color as they want
[01:36:39] <xertion> Example, if they add a image of a grey heart.
[01:36:45] <Cork> why not just have a png file then?
[01:36:47] <xertion> they should be able to make that heart red, green, blue, purple etc.
[01:37:00] <Nancy2012> I get an error "syntaxError: missing name after .operator"  whats wrong with this line… $(this).('td.date_has_event > a').each(function() {
[01:37:08] <xertion> You mean and changing the background?
[01:37:10] <Cork> make a transparent png file and just change the colors of the element
[01:37:13] <Cork> yes
[01:37:27] <xec_> Nancy2012: $(this).find('td.... ?
[01:37:28] <Rinthe> anyone?
[01:37:29] <xertion> Well, it's a drag and drop designing tool where they can add many many different elements and pictures.
[01:37:34] <Nancy2012> thanks :)
[01:37:35] <xertion> so the .png file have to be transparent
[01:37:41] <xertion> I can not have a background and then a transparent mask.
[01:37:49] <xertion> because they should be able to put images over and under eachother
[01:37:51] <xertion> since it's drag and drop.
[01:37:59] <Cork> xertion: just add an extra element
[01:38:02] <Cork> or do it in canvas
[01:38:16] <Cork> but if the image is transparent to start with you have solved most of the task

[01:49:51] <seutje> oh man
[01:49:57] * seutje grabs a coffee
[01:50:44] <Cork> seutje: var calls = $.map(this.options.assets, function(asset) { return $.ajax(asset); });
[01:50:52] <lejocelyn> is there a way with jsfiddle to use code from jquery ui like autocomplete ? to have a source of data ?
[01:50:52] <lejocelyn> only with jsonp ?
[01:50:56] <lejocelyn> or do they provide a fake source of data ?
[01:51:13] <seutje> Cork: <3
[01:51:16] <Cork> lejocelyn: you can fake ajax
[01:51:26] <joobie> guys has anyone come across a way or sample of making text move with a kind of blur effect behind it? Sorta like trying to simulate something fast moving
[01:51:37] <joobie> .. or any ideas how to achieve it
[01:53:34] <Cork> joobie: you could try use text-shadow, but it sounds like you might actually have to use canvas
[01:54:46] <lejocelyn> jsfiddle is really amazing
[01:55:53] <joobie> Cork, hmm.. text-shadow might work, with an animate to sorta make the text shadow bigger and then smaller near the end of the move? maybe.. how does the canvas stuff work?
[01:56:28] <Cork> joobie: replace the text with a canvas and then you draw the text in the canvas as you like
[01:56:38] <Cork> you can do most what ever you want with it
[01:57:12] <joobie> Cork, sounds complex
[01:57:18] <Cork> it is
[01:57:52] <joobie> Cork, seen any examples of this sorta effect?
[01:57:59] <joobie> .. save me having to develop it :P
[01:58:08] <Cork> you would have to google
[01:59:21] <joobie> any ideas for what?
[01:59:31] <joobie> ive tried, no joy.. maybe not looking for the right terms
[02:00:41] <Cork> nope
[02:03:13] <Stephen-B> Can someone please have a look at my validation issue, it's driving me insane
[02:03:28] <Stephen-B> Validation plug-in problem, with the date of birth validation in my form. The standard date validation doesn't work for UK date format in Chrome, so I'm using dateITA in the additional-methods file. http://jsfiddle.net/badasafish/WQhSP/ (works OK), http://www.doble.co.uk/old/Apply-for-finance-online-date-test.asp (fails: Error: TypeError: $.validator.methods[method] is undefined Source...
[02:03:30] <Stephen-B> ...File:http://www.doble.co.uk/scripts/jquery-validation-1.11.0/dist/jquery.validate.js Line: 535)
[02:03:42] <kukabynd> folks, is there any way to select multiple elements except add()?
[02:04:33] <Cork> kukabynd: jquery does multi selection by default
[02:04:44] <Cork> just give it a selector that can match more then one element
[02:05:47] <kukabynd> nah, you mean something like this $("nav, #pookie, #footer").fadeOut();
[02:05:58] <kukabynd> what if all used objects are stored in vars?
[02:06:25] <Cork> uh, no i mean like $('.sliders').fadeOut();
[02:06:32] <lejocelyn> strange, with jsfiddle, when trying the json for ajax method source : "/echo/json", it replies "MOVED PERMANENTLY"
[02:06:52] <Cork> lejocelyn: you need to make a post
[02:07:13] <kukabynd> Cork, ok. What if 10 id elements are stored in vars and then i want to put all of them into queue of fadeOut?
[02:07:42] <Cork> '#' + arr.join(', #')
[02:07:58] <Cork> though that was my point, you shouldn't use ids for things like this
[02:08:14] <Cork> give them a grouping class
[02:08:22] <Cork> it makes things like this much easier
[02:08:33] <kukabynd> m.. not sure it is always possible.
[02:08:38] <Cork> (i always wonder why ppl keep being so afraid of classes...)
[02:08:44] <kukabynd> :))
[02:12:54] <Stephen-B> Cork, looks like you know what you are doing.  Would you be kind enough to have a look at my validation problem for me please?
[02:14:41] <Cork> Stephen-B: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/addMethod
[02:21:35] <Stephen-B> thanks for that, but the method is there and works fine in the jsFiddle but won't in my actual page - very confusing
[02:23:15] <Cork> Stephen-B: sounds like your code is running before the method is loaded
[02:25:00] <Stephen-B> oh, I think I found the problem.  There was some other validation on the page happening in a SSI and this is interfering.  Thanks for your help cork :)
[02:25:22] <Cork> heh, didn't really do much
[02:28:18] <Stephen-B> Follow on question Cork: How can I check if the validation script has already been included, and only include if it hasn't
[02:28:56] <Cork> Stephen-B: you might be able to check though $.validator.methods, but not sure
[02:29:17] <Stephen-B> OK
[02:29:21] <Cork> Stephen-B: i've only played with the validator plugin
[02:29:43] <Cork> i normally write small custom validation script when i need it
[02:29:57] <Stephen-B> I was using this: 		if($.isFunction(window.validate) == false){ but it doesn't seem to work
[02:30:03] <Happzz> so $('#x').tablesorter(...) doesn't work after a page is loaded with the back button (latest firefox)
[02:30:06] <Happzz> i tried to fire it again with on pageshow, but that didn't work at all
[02:40:27] <Nancy2012> hey guys.. i have a tiny bug on my calendar.. just trying to select whole month date while clicking on each month and the same for week.. http://jsfiddle.net/bJnHm/
[02:42:49] <Guest14413> Hi
[02:42:53] <dleonardi> is it just me or did the newest chrome break a shitload of things in older jquery versions?
[02:43:02] <Guest14413> I need some directions
[02:43:04] <dleonardi> i'm experiencing a gazillion sites not working
[02:43:11] <dleonardi> including big stuff like airbnb
[02:43:32] <Guest14413> i have some questions in xml
[02:43:54] <dleonardi> onone of my sites i get a "dom exception 8"
[02:44:24] <Guest14413> what channel should i go to?
[02:45:01] <dleonardi> Guest14413: try #xml ? no idea really. if all else fails, just post on stackoverflow
[02:45:12] <Guest14413> thanks
[02:51:20] <Stephen-B> Hi Nancy2012, I'm happy to look at this for you. Can you please reiterate your problem
[02:51:54] <Nancy2012> hey..
[02:52:22] <Nancy2012> i just want to select the whole month date on clicking each Month
[02:53:26] <lejocelyn> why is this bit of jquery ui code not correct :
[02:53:27] <lejocelyn> $(place).autocomplete( "option", "source", function(request, response){ response("The information could not be found in our database. Please add the data with the appropriate form.");} );
[02:53:49] <Nancy2012> it would be the same way for selecting  week, if i want to select all mondays of each month. then all mondays would be selected..
[02:53:50] <lejocelyn> I though I had the right to have a function for the source option
[02:54:35] <Cork> lejocelyn: it expects an array
[02:54:41] <lejocelyn> ah ok
[02:54:51] <Nancy2012> Stephen-B: have you got my problem??
[02:55:05] <Cork> lejocelyn: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[02:55:07] <Stephen-B> im looking at it Nancy2012
[02:55:17] <Nancy2012> thanks alto :)
[02:55:18] <Cork> check the data type
[02:57:14] <Stephen-B> so we never get into here $(this).find('td.dateSelected > a').each(function() {  as there are no td with that class
[02:57:43] <lejocelyn> Cork: I already tried : response(["The information could not be found in our database. Please add the data with the appropriate form."]);
[02:58:09] <lejocelyn> or with  response({label:"test", value:"teste"}
[02:58:21] <lejocelyn> nothing displayed
[02:59:58] <Cork> lejocelyn: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/MHgqq/
[03:08:49] <Krambiorix> hi, where can i paste my problem?
[03:09:00] <Krambiorix> html + jquery
[03:09:08] <Cork> type the question, but not the code
[03:09:10] <Cork> ?p
[03:09:10] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:10:42] <Krambiorix> Cork,  :D
[03:10:48] <Krambiorix> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/Ab6uG/
[03:10:54] <Krambiorix> my dialog doesn't open
[03:10:55] <steveccc> When i have $(this)   How can I specify a div with a class of selectme below this?
[03:11:11] <steveccc> or how can I select it should i say
[03:11:21] <Krambiorix> $(this).find('div.selectme')
[03:11:22] <Cork> steveccc: below, like a sibling, or like a child, or grand child?
[03:11:57] <bluesm> What is preffered, most redable event adding?
[03:12:05] <bluesm> But  $myEl.click  ?
[03:12:06] <Krambiorix> i get the same error: $(...).dialog is not a function
[03:12:07] <bluesm> Or "on"
[03:12:14] <Cork> Krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/Ab6uG/1/
[03:12:23] <steveccc> cork: a child
[03:12:54] <Cork> steveccc: then you want .children('selector') or .find('selector')
[03:13:07] <Cork> children only goes one level down
[03:13:17] <Krambiorix> Cork, what did you change?
[03:13:30] <Cork> Krambiorix: i added jquery ui (the checkbox)
[03:13:54] <Krambiorix> Cork, my code here doesn't work
[03:14:00] <Krambiorix> would it be a jquery ui problem?
[03:14:11] <Cork> if you get the not a function; yes
[03:14:56] <bluesm> I'm sorry could you repeat ? Problem with connection @Cork
[03:15:30] <Cork> bluesm: heh, nice how you expect that i answered :D
[03:15:31] <Krambiorix> Cork, solved, you were right
[03:15:38] <Krambiorix> thaaanks
[03:15:45] <bluesm> Cork: nope
[03:16:01] <bluesm> Cork: I missed the channell.
[03:16:04] <Cork> bluesm: .click and .on('click') is the preferred ways
[03:16:39] <Cork> though for delegation i think .delegate is more readable
[03:16:56] <Cork> though i'm not picky witch one is used
[03:17:40] <steveccc> cork: sorry i got straight into coding - thanks for the reply
[03:17:55] <bluesm> Cork: Why not myEl.click ()
[03:18:08] <bluesm> Cork: I mean when not using delegation
[03:18:11] <Cork> bluesm: that would be the first one i typed
[03:18:29] <Cork> <Cork> bluesm: .click and <--
[03:20:42] <Krambiorix> Cork, any idea why TEST isn't shown http://jsfiddle.net/Ab6uG/2/
[03:21:10] <dilonh> hello, i want to get mouse position relative to the canvas. someone said on stackoverflow to "add a onmousemove event listener to the canvas element". i'm not sure to get what he means. this is what i have :  http://jsfiddle.net/rfW8U/
[03:22:17] <Nancy2012> Cork: may you please help me out.. i just want to select all dates of each month while clicking on it… http://jsfiddle.net/bJnHm/
[03:22:33] <Cork> Krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/Ab6uG/3/
[03:22:56] <Cork> Krambiorix: you don't need to do the absolute, block dance, dialog does that by default
[03:23:12] <Nancy2012> i want that when i select on month the whole dates of that month would be selected..
[03:23:15] <fabioportieri> he means something like $("canvas").on("mousemove",function(e) {}); dilonh
[03:24:44] <Krambiorix> great, thanks again Cork
[03:25:11] <dilonh> thank you fabioportieri . this is my new code but the x value seems offseted by 8. http://jsfiddle.net/rfW8U/2/
[03:26:00] <steveccc> cork: is it possible to use not with $(".menulink").hover(function(){     so that I can use this selector to select all items that dont have a child a href with a class of active?
[03:27:00] <Cork> steveccc: you should never try to select an element based on its children
[03:27:10] <Cork> the dom isn't meant to do that and it's slow
[03:27:44] <Cork> you're better of moving the active class up to the parent you want the hover on
[03:31:20] <Nancy2012>  i just want to select all dates(month) when the month would be clicked… http://jsfiddle.net/bJnHm/
[03:32:41] <Cork> Nancy2012: that's not just though
[03:33:29] <Cork> and what do you mean by all months?
[03:34:08] <Nancy2012> if i click on May 2013, all dates of may 2013 would be selected.. that is thing what i want
[03:34:59] <lejocelyn> I've got problems with autocomplete and the response option, it always think ui.content.length === 0, http://jsfiddle.net/MHgqq/9/
[03:35:05] <Cork> is this a calender you've built your self or something?
[03:36:50] <Cork> lejocelyn: works fine here http://fiddle.jshell.net/MHgqq/9/show/
[03:38:10] <Cork> ontologycomplete is undefined though
[03:38:35] <lejocelyn> ah ok, I though I updated it

[03:40:01] <lejocelyn> Cork: and http://fiddle.jshell.net/MHgqq/9/show/ doesn't work for me :(
[03:40:07] <Cork> wah...
[03:40:24] <Cork> your calling auocmplete source in response...
[03:40:31] <Cork> that won't work
[03:41:02] <Cork> lejocelyn: http://fiddle.jshell.net/MHgqq/10/show/ and check the console output
[03:41:08] <Cork> works fine here
[03:41:16] <Cork> 10, 5, 0 + error
[03:43:19] <lejocelyn> doesn't work here :(
[03:43:30] <lejocelyn> the console log always tell 0
[03:44:30] <Cork> lejocelyn: load http://fiddle.jshell.net/MHgqq/10/show/ typ "asb" on character at a time
[03:44:46] <Cork> *type
[03:44:53] <Cork> sigh
[03:44:57] <Cork> *one character
[03:45:01] <Nancy2012> Cork: sorry for reply late.. yes.. this calenter is builded totally by myself..
[03:45:30] <Cork> Nancy2012: then you need to provide all the information about what is needed to do what you talk about
[03:45:32] <Nancy2012> but if u look at date selecting.. it works..
[03:45:59] <Nancy2012> selecting date by date.. it works..
[03:46:17] <Nancy2012> i wanna to do the same for selecting month by month..
[03:46:35] <Nancy2012> i m sure that you got me completely what i m looking for..
[03:48:37] <Cork> Nancy2012: don't have time to dissect the entire page in order to understand what your looking for
[03:49:36] <Nancy2012> seems it works now..

[03:49:43] <kukabynd> folks, any idea how to mimic native iOs date chooser on the web, but with different styles?
[03:49:46] <Nancy2012> one of guy fixed it up
[03:50:16] <Cork> kukabynd: i've seen widgets floating around for that
[03:50:22] <lejocelyn> Cork: I'm not sure it's the correct way to display this kind of message
[03:50:39] <Cork> lejocelyn: no, i don't think it is
[03:50:51] <kukabynd> it is almost impossible to hit bootstrap date chooser on touch devices
[03:50:58] <kukabynd> especially the ones with big or fat fingers/hands
[03:51:33] <kukabynd> there is a support of html5 date picker on ios
[03:51:44] <kukabynd> but no custom styling of what I know

[03:53:46] <Cork> kukabynd: just to mention one of the ones i found after a few secs of searching
[03:53:58] <kukabynd> :)
[03:54:18] <kukabynd> one thing is to find, another thing to recommend
[03:54:44] <Cork> can't recommend any of them really
[03:55:40] <kukabynd> btw, not open-source
[03:55:48] <kukabynd> tho what is these days
[03:59:36] <ryorky1> what could be causing me to get a Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'effect'  error msg?
[04:00:56] <Cork> ryorky1: too little context
[04:02:21] <ryorky1> Cork:  I'm using a rails gem called best_in_place and here is my js code and the error msg:  http://pastie.org/7979256
[04:02:58] <Cork> well jquery doesn't have a method effect
[04:03:11] <Cork> and the lib your trying to load isn't loaded
[04:03:13] <bluesm> IS there  a way to make something like "train" with slide effect ?
[04:03:34] <Cork> sure
[04:03:52] <bluesm> I mean to one div slide to the right (where is invisible) and another div is slide from left..
[04:05:15] <ryorky1> Cork:  here is a sample row from my html:  http://pastie.org/7983284
[04:05:34] <ryorky1> I have all of the necessary jquery files included
[04:05:50] <Cork> except a plugin that creates the $.fn.effect
[04:06:11] <Cork> .effect isn't a function in jquery or jquery.ui
[04:06:36] <ryorky1> Cork:  http://api.jqueryui.com/bounce-effect/
[04:07:03] <Cork> ryorky1: read the page again
[04:07:17] <notbrent_> hi there
[04:07:33] <notbrent_> alert($('<h1>hi</h1>').text()) in ie8 alerts nothing, while in normal browsers it gives me hi
[04:07:40] <notbrent_> using jquery 1.9.1
[04:07:43] <notbrent_> any ideas?
[04:08:06] <Cork> what does alert($('<h1>hi</h1>').html()) give you?
[04:08:28] <ryorky1> Cork:  well, what is the easiest way to get a div to just bounce?
[04:08:37] <Cork> ?.animate
[04:08:38] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[04:08:39] <notbrent_> also blank alert
[04:08:46] <notbrent_> ./cc ryorky1
[04:09:27] <notbrent_> gives me hi on chrome
[04:09:33] <notbrent_> as expected
[04:09:42] <Cork> uh... read the question again
[04:10:17] <notbrent_> it looks like downgrading to 1.8.3 fixes it
[04:10:23] <notbrent_> seems like a regression in 1.9
[04:10:55] <Cork> notbrent_: what about $.parseHTML('<h1>hi</h1>').text() ?
[04:12:40] <notbrent_> gives me an "object does not support this property or method"
[04:13:36] <notbrent_> referring to .text
[04:13:47] <notbrent_> well i'll just downgrade to 1.8.3 then
[04:13:56] <bluesm> Cork:   http://jsbin.com/bluesm/last
[04:14:14] <bluesm> Cork:  But I have problem that the "conteiners" are piling up ....
[04:15:05] <notbrent_> looks like IE support was dropped a bit too early, before 2
[04:15:13] <notbrent_> shame
[04:15:27] <notbrent_> anyways, thanks for the help Cork and thanks jQuery guys for the hard work
[04:17:18] <lejocelyn> I still can manage to display a specific answer when njo result  with jquery autocompletion: http://fiddle.jshell.net/MHgqq/19/  if any idea, your welcome
[04:17:19] <Cork> notbrent_: http://jsfiddle.net/QvcHy/2/ works just fine here
[04:17:39] <ryorky1> Cork:  I tried animate which got rid of my error msg, but I still cant get the tr to bounce, hre is my js and a smple row:  http://pastie.org/7983323
[04:17:53] <Cork> notbrent_: there is a bug in 1.9 and 2.0 where leading tabs and spaces trigger the parser think it's a selector
[04:17:57] <ryorky1> is my selector or chaining wrong?
[04:18:00] <notbrent_> Cork: you' re right, that is working in ie8
[04:18:16] <notbrent_> i wonder what the difference is in my local setup
[04:18:22] <Cork> notbrent_: if that is the problem you can try $($.parseHTML(string))
[04:18:29] <notbrent_> tried that too
[04:18:32] <notbrent_> same result
[04:18:36] <Cork> with the extra wrapping?
[04:18:38] <notbrent_> yeah
[04:18:48] <notbrent_> tried both with and without the wrapping
[04:18:51] <Cork> then it sounds like you have something wrong with your copy of jquery
[04:19:02] <notbrent_> i even tried switching to 1.9.1, same thing
[04:19:07] <notbrent_> somehow 1.8.3 fixes it
[04:19:49] <notbrent_> it could somehow be related to the massive amounts of other legacy javascript on the project - prototype & plugins for it, yui
[04:19:55] <notbrent_> hard to say how they might be interacting
[04:20:26] <Cork> ryorky1: sigh, read the api page for how the syntax works instead of just slapping the arguments and hoping it works
[04:20:48] <Cork> *arguments on the function
[04:21:04] <ryorky1> Cork, sry, will do.  Been up for 22 hrs, just trying to get this to work
[04:21:18] <Cork> notbrent_: ya, i would suspect it is
[04:21:39] <notbrent_> trying to phase those out ..
[04:22:47] <Cork> O_o
[04:23:09] <Cork> ryorky1: just saw that jquery ui has added an effect function to do the same  thing as animate
[04:23:21] <Cork> so ya... effect does exist if you use jquery ui
[04:23:27] <Cork> wtf...
[04:25:06] <Cork> bluesm: what is piling up?
[04:26:04] <bluesm> Cork:  http://jsbin.com/aququs/18
[04:26:23] <bluesm> Cork: One wrapper is above another.
[04:27:35] <Cork> bluesm: ya, its most likely from how the animation works
[04:36:55] <rgr> what are the standard css and js file permissions on a Linux system? I'm getting a forbidden error on a css file  - I set it to 755, 644 but still no joy.
[04:37:27] <deepy> This sounds like less of a #jquery question and more of a #yourwebserver question
[04:37:34] <Cork> rgr: read is all you need
[04:37:35] <rgr> Im guessing it might be a deeper problem (I just downloaded a newew jquery-ui setup) but chrome isnt saying much other than "forbidden".
[04:37:48] <deepy> 744 is working neatly for me
[04:37:49] <Cork> rgr: sounds like the webserver is blocking it for some reason
[04:38:01] <rgr> ok thanks folks.
[04:38:02] <Cork> check your htaccess isn't doing something
[04:38:25] <rgr> just wnated some confirmation. Must be something else.
[04:39:48] <lejocelyn> with jquery autocomplete, why can't you just modify ui.content to change what will be displayed to the user ?
[04:40:10] <lejocelyn> according to http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-response , that should be the case
[04:40:31] <lejocelyn> but http://fiddle.jshell.net/MHgqq/19/ doesn't work
[04:42:43] <anew> anyone using cycle plugin? it's so slow to load for me.  i dont load all the images on the page, so i have to download each one on cycle, but still it's very slow
[04:43:03] <Cork> lejocelyn: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/frUky/
[04:46:18] <dumbdell> hey Cork
[04:47:55] <dumbdell> you the extend prefixes function can it be made to return the actual css prefix instead of the dom's css function prefix :) ?
[04:48:03] <dumbdell> you know^
[04:48:15] <Cork> dumbdell: sure
[04:48:27] <Cork> just use the css prefix instead
[04:49:03] <lejocelyn> I'm not sure why didn't work :(
[04:49:36] <lejocelyn> thanks Cork, got it
[04:50:39] <Cork> lejocelyn: i slapped that function together on the fly when i got the pb, so it might not match all prefixes correctly and so on
[04:50:40] <dumbdell> k so elem.style[name[i]] != undefined will work if name[i] was -prefix-propeerty then ?
[04:50:56] <Cork> no
[04:51:20] <Cork> you would have to return the css type value when the dom type value matches
[04:51:55] <Cork> dumbdell: the -prefix-key solution is converted by jquery
[04:53:07] <dumbdell> ah i see
[04:55:49] <Vasa> hey I am trying to get a jsonp from a cross domain with this code: http://pastebin.com/m53An2MV  (in firebug console) , when I recieve something I can see in the net tab that i got it but the 'success' does not fire, and it keeps listening on what do i do wrong?
[04:56:30] <Vasa> but eventually it timeouts and the recieved command does run
[04:56:36] <Cork> Vasa: add an error callback
[04:57:57] <Vasa> cork: I tried that right now, it does not go out of the function
[04:57:59] <Vasa> it keeps listening
[04:58:14] <Vasa> I am sending it: func({"first_name": "Smithson"})
[04:58:25] <Cork> hmm
[04:58:32] <Cork> that should work
[04:58:38] <Vasa> when I repeatedly send it it still gets it but doesn't go out, maybe because i try things in fierbug?
[04:59:06] <Vasa> like in the net tab I can see i got func({"first_name": "Smithson"})
[04:59:26] <Vasa> but if i send it again, it adds a new line to the response
[04:59:50] <Cork> Vasa: try opening the built in error console and make sure it doesn't eat your error messages
[04:59:59] <Cork> i've had that happen in the past
[05:00:25] <Vasa> wow there is a surprise
[05:02:23] <dumbdell> so one way it just make another array say vendorpfix[] with "-vendorx-key" in the same order as the dom prefixes in names[] and return the  value from vendorpfix[i] instead
[05:02:38] <marlun78> Is there some one here that are deep into the Deferreds?
[05:05:34] <Vasa> cork: maybe it should be not tested using firebug, and the callback function must already exsist?
[05:06:14] <Vasa> or is the function made with jquery itself
[05:06:40] <Vasa> the problem is that it goes to the success callback only on timeout
[05:06:48] <Vasa> and not when it just recieves the data
[05:09:12] <dumbdell> Cork .. or  return { dom: names[i], css: vendorpfix[i] }
[05:12:57] <sie> Does sizzle have a preprocessor? I'm guessing that it doesn't.
[05:17:22] <Abhijit> hi
[05:17:31] <Abhijit> how can i read local json file ?
[05:17:38] <Abhijit> and then parse it in jq?
[05:17:50] <Abhijit> file not on the server
[05:18:53] <dumbdell> .parseJSON
[05:20:17] <dumbdell> and to actually open the local file you can do it with html5 fileReader
[05:21:27] <Abhijit> dumbdell, this line $.getJSON('json/eventData.json', function(data)  is not reading the file
[05:21:46] <Abhijit> it prints dummy obj, obj
[05:22:06] <dumbdell> yeah most probably because the $.getJSON method is basically an ajax method
[05:23:40] <Abhijit> dumbdell, then how do i do it?
[05:24:35] <dumbdell> there might well be a jquery specific way which i dont know of off the top of my head that will open local files ... but i know for certain you can read local files with the html5 fileReader and then .parseJSON the read data to make it into a JSON object
[05:24:57] <dan2k3k4> does calling $(elem).addClass("theClass"); multiple times, add the class multiple times to that element?
[05:25:03] <Abhijit> it sounds so long and complex
[05:25:15] <dumbdell> not really
[05:25:49] <dumbdell> it couldnt be simpler tbh .. its just that its only going to play nice on next gen browsers..
[05:27:30] <bluesm> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16834906/train-effect-with-jquery-ui-slide-effect
[05:28:32] <dumbdell> Abhijit im making your a fiddle
[05:28:51] <Abhijit> thanks
[05:29:09] <bluesm> Do you know how solve that problem ?
[05:31:24] <dumbdell> ah Abhijit you actually cant/shoulnt really .. unless the user selects the file for reading
[05:31:47] <Abhijit> this is not for user. some development work
[05:31:58] <dumbdell> if the file is local to the webserver it self then yeah its cool
[05:32:51] <dumbdell> but you cant really go trudging round peoples hdds like that its not really on :D the new browsers even took away file://
[05:34:47] <Abhijit> dumbdell, its not a webserver
[05:34:52] <Abhijit> plain .himl
[05:34:53] <Abhijit> html
[05:37:44] <dumbdell> i dont know how you could do it then with out file:// on older browsers its probably doable tho
[05:39:26] <dumbdell> why not install something like xampp
[05:39:35] <dumbdell> then your probably will go away
[05:39:47] <dumbdell> er problem*
[05:39:50] <motaka2> does any one knows what I should do when I send an ajax requet to a url but that url contains some code like header("location:{$url2}"); in these cases I want the javascript to send a second to url 2 request or somthing similar
[05:41:38] <Abhijit> dumbdell, ok
[05:42:11] <jugglinmike> motaka2: Are you saying that the URL contains within it another URL, and you'd like to send another request to that second URL, as well?
[05:43:56] <motaka2> jugglinmike: Yes suppose the server side language is PHP and I sent a request to a page and that page itself is containing header(location url2) , no I want js to call for tha address in the header
[05:44:58] <jugglinmike> motaka2: Are you curious about how to access the header? Or is it that you can access it, but you need help parsing the URL?
[05:45:14] <motaka2> jugglinmike: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199099/how-to-manage-a-redirect-request-after-a-jquery-ajax-call
[05:45:42] <dokma> I've got login and account creation forms. Login form also uses facebook login that will redirect user to facebook if not already logged in with them. I'd like to protect the user from losing form data in such a case.
[05:45:51] <dokma> Any good ways of doing this with jquery?
[05:47:21] <Abhijit> dumbdell, i put it in lamp and still getting this ct],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
[05:49:56] <jugglinmike> motaka2: That link doesn't really help me. Did you see my previous question?
[05:52:59] <dumbdell> try just console.log(data["some_key_you_know_exists"]); ?
[05:56:19] <Abhijit> dumbdell, anything wrong in this code var items = [];	$.each(data, function(key, val) {items.push('<li id="' + key + '">' + val + '</li>');});$('<ul/>', {'class': 'my-new-list',html: items.join('')}).appendTo('body');});
[05:57:15] <dumbdell> o-O
[05:58:37] <xec_> Abhijit: maybe. what is it supposed to do? what does it do instead? what is data?
[05:59:03] <xec_> any errors in console?
[05:59:07] <compact> hi. i have: http://jsfiddle.net/SJWwc/
[05:59:14] <compact> any idea why it keeps fading out then back in?
[05:59:17] <compact> not just once?
[05:59:36] <Abhijit> xec_, it is supposed to print the json data from file. i know that it can read the file but it is not printing the data of json file. istead it prints [object Object] the data is
[05:59:38] <motaka2> and care
[06:00:18] <Abhijit> xec_, data is first sample from here http://json.org/example.html
[06:00:22] <Abhijit> glossary
[06:00:32] <xec_> Abhijit: if i was you i'd inspect data to see what it really is, then go from there...
[06:01:12] <Abhijit> its a json sample
[06:01:48] <xec_> Abhijit: so you're looping through a single property?
[06:02:52] <Abhijit> just for testing. once this works i will write the actual json data. and singse or not the code shourd read the file?
[06:02:57] <xec_> compact: fadeout makes it disappear, so when you move the mouse it will trigger the mouseleave (before leaving the bounds of the original image)
[06:03:12] <compact> ah thanks, found another way of getting it to work
[06:03:58] <xec_> compact: http://jsfiddle.net/SJWwc/1/
[06:04:08] <dumbdell> http://jsfiddle.net/DRBGF/
[06:04:12] <dumbdell> nm
[06:04:13] <dumbdell> :)
[06:04:40] <compact> thanks xec_
[06:04:45] <compact> hwo would i get it to do floorplan-*
[06:05:05] <compact> so will work for floorplan-1 floorplan-2 etc
[06:06:02] <xec_> compact: the easy way? use a common classname http://jsfiddle.net/SJWwc/2/
[06:07:43] <xec_> compact: sorry bad demo, improved: http://jsfiddle.net/SJWwc/3/
[06:08:29] <compact> hahah thanks heaps, also one more thing (sorry to be annoying)
[06:08:38] <compact> on the fadeout, add text in the middle of the pic
[06:08:49] <compact> so Floorplan <number>
[06:09:42] <xec_> compact: that would need a different approach, as opacity is applied to all children as well
[06:10:22] <compact> fadeto?
[06:10:22] <xec_> compact: you could create a sibling and position it properly, or have an overlay that fades in (instead of the image fading out)
[06:10:54] <xec_> but i'm afk a little while, give it a whirl
[06:11:09] <compact> oki, thanks heaps
[06:18:54] <Abhijit> dumbdell, my code worts with this {"one": "Singular sensation","two": "Beady little eyes","three": "Little birds pitch by my doorstep"} but do not work with my own json data which is valid json data
[06:21:01] <Abhijit> dumbdell, i checked its validity using jsonlint dumbdell
[06:25:18] <dumbdell> Abhijit http://jsfiddle.net/DRBGF/1/
[06:27:55] <Abhijit> dumbdell, it fails with my json http://paste.opensuse.org/40961830 however i checket its validity
[06:28:52] <vladyn> hi people
[06:28:56] <bittyx-work> hi all! is there a nice way to generate urls via jquery? ie. assuming: var url = { protocol: "http", domain: "www.website.com", path: "/some/website/page", parameters: { search: "123", order: "asc" } }; - i want a function to return "http://www.website.com/some/website/page?search=123&order=asc" - i know this isn't particularly hard to do, but it seems like a really common problem, and i don't want t
[06:28:56] <bittyx-work> o reinvent the wheel
[06:29:42] <bittyx-work> in php i'd just do http_build_query() (or parse_url() for the opposite operation)
[06:30:22] <vladyn> what the .filter returns? is it returns the jquery element found?
[06:30:31] <vladyn> lame question - heh
[06:30:39] <Hooloovoo> bittyx-work: well the ajax function does it
[06:30:52] <Hooloovoo> have a look at the source and see if you can access that function
[06:31:00] <bittyx-work> Hooloovoo: but is there some helper method that does this specifically?
[06:31:01] <dumbdell> Abhijit http://jsfiddle.net/DRBGF/2/ <-- you json made of arrays so your going have to dig into the data to get the jam
[06:31:08] <bittyx-work> Hooloovoo: oh, okay, thanks, will do!
[06:31:42] <Abhijit> dumbdell, it still alert box the [object, object]
[06:34:03] <bittyx-work> Hooloovoo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L435 <--- found it here, thanks! for reference, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/ is the function that does that main part of the conversion
[06:34:34] <Hooloovoo> bittyx-work: No problemo!
[06:38:20] <^^jfc^^> hello there. I'm trying to code an script to work as an accordion.

[06:46:52] <anli_> When I use clearTimeout, can I be sure the event will not occur?
[06:47:03] <dumbdell> http://jsfiddle.net/DRBGF/3/ <--- that is kind of humerious but surely theres a better way
[06:48:08] <NoiseEee> anli_: providing you use the correct reference
[06:48:21] <anli_> Yes, and that there are no other syntax errors
[06:48:34] <anli_> Hm, maybe that will clear timeouts...
[06:48:42] <anli_> Is a script error causing that?

[07:05:47] <c4ptnh00k> morning gents
[07:12:34] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm getting on error when trying to make an AJAX exchange. Anybody know what's wrong? - Code: http://jsfiddle.net/xkL2T/   - Error: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'fail'
[07:12:42] <DeltaHeavy> I'm referencing some of my previous code, and I have NO idea why it's doing this
[07:13:41] <spillere> the only jquery function im using is slideDown() and slideUp(), what is the smallest version i can get for this?
[07:14:46] <NoiseEee> spillere: worry less about your JS size and drop an image, voila
[07:14:50] <DeltaHeavy> spillere: To be honest, assuming you're linking jQuery from a CDN, it's usually faster to just have the full version since the user probably already has it cached.
[07:15:01] <rosieres> Has anyone ever had the Issue with fancybox that the title attribute of the first image that is clicked is not shown ? If I switch to the next image and switch back it does appear ! Quite strange . . .
[07:15:02] <NoiseEee> lol @ people fretting over JS size
[07:15:30] <spillere> i'm linking http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.0.min.js, so i'm probably good right?!
[07:15:46] <DeltaHeavy> Ah, I'm using an old version of jQuery -_-
[07:19:50] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know where I can see the oldschool version of $.ajax with 'error' and 'success' references?
[07:19:59] <DeltaHeavy> Instead of .done, and .fail
[07:23:51] <c4ptnh00k> DeltaHeavy: Didnt know that was oldschool. Thats what i DO DAILY
[07:24:13] <DeltaHeavy> c4ptnh00k: It's depreciated :p
[07:24:33] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: success: function(){}, error: function() {} as far as I know.
[07:24:36] <c4ptnh00k> XD
[07:24:44] <c4ptnh00k> yup
[07:25:22] <BillCriswell> I'm pretty sure Chromes "Find On Page" is screwed up.
[07:25:36] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know why I'm getting 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier ' on this? - http://jsfiddle.net/HsjBQ/2/
[07:25:49] <DeltaHeavy> Error is in the jQuery file so idk where it is in the code =/
[07:26:25] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: You forgot a ,
[07:26:32] <c4ptnh00k> ,
[07:26:36] <BillCriswell> Between } and error.
[07:26:42] <c4ptnh00k> dang it bill lol
[07:26:57] <DeltaHeavy> Fantastic, thanks =D
[07:27:18] <BillCriswell> It's amazing what the console will tell you when you click the link number. =p
[07:27:26] <BillCriswell> s/link/line
[07:27:41] <c4ptnh00k> I need to be faster ...
[07:29:00] <BillCriswell> It's not as helpful as you'd think I bet haha
[07:37:27] <poseidon> When I do $( '#add-article' ).button() it only applies to the first button
[07:37:32] <poseidon> How can I get it to apply to all?
[07:37:48] <poseidon> all add-article buttons
[07:40:47] <BillCriswell> poseidon: $('#add-article button') I think is what you want?
[07:41:03] <BillCriswell> Unless #add-article is a button?
[07:41:14] <poseidon> It is a button
[07:41:25] <BillCriswell> Then you may need to use class="add-article" instead of id="add-article" and do $('.add-article').button()
[07:41:42] <Clex> How do I put "</script>" in a JavaScript string ? Browsers can't parse var foo = "<script/>";
[07:41:53] <BillCriswell> Ok then, drop that "may" haha.
[07:42:14] <poseidon> ah, thanks!
[07:42:20] <BillCriswell> poseidon: No problem.
[07:43:28] <BillCriswell> Clex: What do you mean by parse?
[07:43:47] <Clex> I get a parse error.
[07:44:11] <BillCriswell> var foo = "</script>"; works just fine for me, and I can just use it with with foo.
[07:45:51] <Clex> <html><head><script>var foo = '</script>';</script><body></body></html>
[07:46:13] <Clex> This causes a parse error on Firefox and Chrome.
[07:46:27] <Clex> +</head>
[07:47:40] <deepy> Is that only with inline JS?
[07:48:32] <Clex> I think so.
[07:49:13] <BillCriswell> Ah, I tried it in the console.
[07:50:42] <BillCriswell> Clex: http://jsbin.com/afejuj/1/edit works
[07:50:55] <BillCriswell> That's goofy.. sure there's a good reason for it, though.
[07:51:59] <womack> hello
[07:53:29] <Clex> BillCriswell: the answer is to use CDATA.
[07:53:36] <Clex> The parser parses XHTML and nothing else.
[07:54:05] <Dreamwinter> I have a question about using .append()
[07:54:11] <BillCriswell> Clex: foo = '<' + '/script>'; worked as well.
[07:54:17] <Dreamwinter> How do you include HTML tags?
[07:54:36] <Dreamwinter> I'm reading: http://api.jquery.com/append/
[07:54:53] <BillCriswell> Dreamwinter: Just put them in. $('#bio').append('<p>I am <strong>neat</strong></p>')
[07:55:13] <Dreamwinter> Yeah that's what the manual says but my tags show up :/
[07:55:36] <Dreamwinter> $("#codeerror").append('Name Error: <br>');
[07:55:39] <lejocelyn_> I'd like to have my buttons to add or remove forms displayed side to the last added <li><input>, any ideas : http://jsfiddle.net/sSbJU/1/
[07:55:47] <Clex> BillCriswell: except that my inlines are generated.
[07:55:47] <Dreamwinter> But <br> actually shows up.
[07:56:01] <megusta> hi, can someone help me with a js problem?
[07:56:06] <catphish> i am having trouble with performance of a short animate on android, are there simple ways to improve it?
[07:56:32] <RobW> don't use jquery for mobile
[07:56:59] <Dreamwinter> So I'm confused why it's not processing the HTML tags.
[07:57:01] <jedimind> mabe 2
[07:57:04] <jedimind> maybe*
[07:57:16] <RobW> use jquery mobile instead (iirc) or tailor something for your app
[07:57:24] <BillCriswell> Dreamwinter: http://jsbin.com/ogiqaq/1/edit doing anything different than here?
[07:57:25] <megusta> when i change background per css() in a for loop then only the last one is executed. how can i make them flash like disco lights? http://jsfiddle.net/uFL3F/2/
[07:57:59] <BillCriswell> Is coderror like a textarea or something like that?
[07:58:03] <RobW> megusta: you need to set it to timeout between changes
[07:58:10] <jedimind> using jquery 2 may be an option for mobile catphish  RobW  as it relies on css3 transitions and animations
[07:58:13] <jedimind> rather than using js
[07:58:24] <Dreamwinter> Yeah
[07:58:25] <RobW> what?
[07:58:28] <Dreamwinter> It's actually showing <br>
[07:58:38] <Dreamwinter> Not executing it
[07:58:38] <RobW> you can transition css w/regular javascript.. just takes some work lol
[07:58:40] <BillCriswell> Dreamwinter: A textarea will show a <br>.
[07:58:51] <Dreamwinter> It's not a text area, it's a span.
[07:58:59] <jedimind> RobW he was complaining that using jquery (im assuming 1.*) is laggy in android with transitions
[07:59:24] <jedimind> and i'm just saying that jquery 2 is better with that because its built for modern browsers, and may be a viable solution for mobile
[07:59:30] <BillCriswell> Dreamwinter: That should be fine. There's something else going on in the code causing the issue.
[07:59:31] <jedimind> but *shrug*
[07:59:36] <catphish> i'll try that if i can
[07:59:37] <catphish> thanks
[07:59:37] <megusta> RobW: can it be done without timeout? i make some calculations and after that i refesh a results map. can i add a callback function to css, so the next will only be triggered when the last had finished?
[07:59:49] <Dreamwinter> Yea i'm an idiot.
[07:59:51] <Dreamwinter> Double quotes.
[08:00:21] <BillCriswell> Dreamwinter: Not sure I'm following, but glad ou got it figured out haha.
[08:00:38] <RobW> megusta: ultimately, no - not really. you can use the jquery animation and "queue" up the transitions
[08:00:43] <RobW> but I believe it relies on settimeout
[08:01:43] <Dreamwinter> I don't know wtf was going on lol, I had "" instead of '', but when I switched back to "" it worked still.. so... uh.. yeah. User error somewhere. ;)
[08:01:54] <BillCriswell> Haha, nice.
[08:02:15] <megusta> RobW: cant use timeout cause i cant predict how long the calculations will last. animate queue cant be used either because i refresh about 100 boxes. i tried to do it with each() but that seems to have no callback either :(
[08:03:11] <megusta> RobW: thx anyway i will try an unqued animate() with a timer
[08:04:13] <RobW> megusta: you may want to look into using something else?
[08:04:33] <RobW> like canvas.. then write your own opengl code :D
[08:04:49] <Nightgunner5> What handler (if any) does $.ajax({ ifModified: true }) execute if the etag matches?
[08:05:16] <megusta> RobW: hm, thats a good idea. maybe a good opprtunity to look into raphael.js
[08:18:35] <anew> would you guys ever do a popup login form or keep it all with jq ?
[08:21:31] <xec> anew: i'm honestly not sure what that question means
[08:21:55] <xec> anew: by "popup" do you mean window.open() ?
[08:24:31] <gaa> how do i make certain fields in a form appear only when certain items of select are selected?
[08:25:56] <Dreamwinter> ugh
[08:28:42] <xec> gaa: you can listen to the "change" event of the <select>, and .hide() or show() depending on the current value
[08:29:24] <gaa> xec: got any link to elaborate on that?
[08:29:32] <Dreamwinter> lol wtf
[08:30:01] <xec> gaa: it's pretty straight-forward, what part did/didn't you understand?
[08:30:26] <Dreamwinter> Oh god lol I am dumb sometimes. ;)
[08:30:42] <sikor_sxe> hello, when i have a jquery object and i read its offset().left, then i get a result which is off by 5 px, when i use myObject.context.offsetLeft i get the correct value? anyone knows why the values are different?
[08:30:44] <^^jfc^^> hello there. I'm trying to code an script to work as an accordion. I got it with toggle() The only problem I have, is when clicking on a new element, the previous element should collapse and it does, but when clicking from bottom to top elements, some of the elements stay expanded: http://jsfiddle.net/UREff/
[08:31:09] <Elrinth2> is there any way to: on start event on draggable, to create a clone of the element you started moving, and move the clonse instead ?
[08:31:27] <xec> Elrinth2: yes, it's an option iirc
[08:31:50] <Elrinth2> I need to create the clone myself
[08:32:31] <Elrinth2> because I want to move the element from a div into another div, before I start moving it
[08:32:44] <Elrinth2> and appendTo won't work with IE8.
[08:33:06] <xec> appendTo won't work with IE8? how sure are you about that
[08:34:03] <xec> Elrinth2: anyway, with the "helper" option you can supply a function that returns whatever cloned node or whatnot i believe
[08:34:20] <xec> like, you can make your own dom elemtn
[08:34:23] <xec> element*
[08:35:52] <Elrinth2> xec basically I've got a system I've built for a client (you can build your own comic strips in it). the only last issue I have is with an IE8 bug. We're forced to use an old version of jquery, which probably has a bug in it.
[08:36:13] <Elrinth2> basically the appendTo doesn't generate "proper" html which internet explorer explodes when using.
[08:37:35] <gggritso> morning everyone
[08:37:54] <gggritso> would really appreciate some advice with a window resize problem, if anyone's around
[08:38:15] <xec> ^^jfc^^: all the others seem to close whatever order i click the titles. (ff)
[08:41:42] <gaa> xec: a working example would help
[08:42:11] <^^jfc^^> thx xec but they are not working properly when checking on my site
[08:42:15] <xec> gaa: make a demo with what you got so far. i'm not going to code your script for you ;)
[08:42:33] <^^jfc^^> they close properly from top to bottom, but not in the opposite order
[08:46:15] <gaa> xec: http://jsbin.com/ikeyez/1/
[08:47:21] <gaa> i want the number of persons field to appear only when business, friends, family or others are selected
[08:47:41] <gaa> (single person should automatically mean 1, and date 2)
[08:50:13] <supsup> gaa: prob would be easier to have an input for each type.
[08:50:45] <supsup> name=numberofFriends, numberofbusiness etc
[08:51:25] <supsup> then it would be trival to match the name of the selection option value to the name of the hidden field
[08:52:48] <gaa> i think it would be easier for users if i can manage it with the select field
[08:53:00] <supsup> it would appear the same as it appears now
[08:53:30] <gaa> how would i do it then?
[08:54:13] <anew> xec popup i mean a new window open for login or do it with jq lightbox
[08:57:28] <spanglesontoast> anyone know the correct way to secure an api for ajax to consume ?
[08:58:53] <xec> gaa: this should get you started http://jsfiddle.net/rYFj5/
[08:59:39] <xec> anew: either way works? probably easier without the popup
[09:00:03] <poseidon> Is there a way to limit the amount of text in a div via jquery?  ie I have a very long link that I want to show http://somelonglink.com/bla...
[09:00:03] <anew> xec yeah either way works, just wondering wht is more standard
[09:00:33] <poseidon> (though it is just text, not an href)
[09:01:02] <supsup> gaa: http://jsbin.com/ikeyez/3/
[09:01:36] <c4ptnh00k> poseidon: set the text as a var and then you can work with the .length()
[09:02:46] <supsup> or yeah like xec, the label reducdency in mine did not mean to do.  I'd rather have a server model that has seperate inputs tho
[09:04:23] <supsup> poseidon: there are plugins for that also.
[09:05:05] <supsup> search truncate jquery plugin or something, then you can look at their code to see hwo they do it
[09:05:10] <meLon> poseidon: You want to 'truncate' the text
[09:05:28] <meLon> Awww, supsup beat me :P
[09:05:34] <gaa> supsup: thanks, when i submit this form, how do i get the values for single/date though?
[09:05:49] <supsup> gaa: do you even have a backend?
[09:07:00] <supsup> server side uses names of the inputs to create an object.  thats outside realm of jquery tho
[09:07:19] <ankush> I have to upload 2 files on a form using ajax, it should be like a form submit with the 2 files and other input fields, not just a  file upload.  Can anyone suggest me an appropriate plugin for it?
[09:07:36] <gaa> supsup: not currently, but i can use php sendmail
[09:07:53] <supsup> i'd look into documentation on php sendmail then ;-0
[09:07:56] <supsup> i don't use php
[09:08:09] <supsup> i assume it would be based on the name of the inputs
[09:08:10] <gaa> no way i can do it via jquery?
[09:08:21] <supsup> i don't know scope of what your trying to do
[09:09:07] <supsup> you have to have a server setup to send an email (unless you do it manually) or you want the person filling out the form to email someone.
[09:10:25] <ankush> I have to upload 2 files on a form using ajax, it should be like a form submit with the 2 files and other input fields, not just a  file upload.  Can anyone suggest me an appropriate plugin for it? I tried many file upload, but they upload just one file, I cant find one which assists me to upload files with other data, lik a form submit
[09:11:05] <supsup> gaa: form data -> can be saved to a database, then work can be done on it later, or form data can be saved to memory and work can be done on it right away and then discarded. Or, both. Thats the three main uses of form data i do.  Perhaps there are others.
[09:11:36] <gaa> supsup: i can save the form to database via jquery?
[09:11:42] <supsup> no
[09:11:52] <supsup> well maybe via Rest Setup
[09:11:59] <supsup> buit technically thats not jquery
[09:12:02] <supsup> it's just calling ajax
[09:12:06] <supsup> to a rest server
[09:12:50] <supsup> only database jquery would be able to access is the new browser based one, via some plugin.  I don't know much about it.  Even then it would be local to the client not your server.
[09:13:19] <supsup> unless i guess your using node.js or something then prob so again don't know much about that either
[09:14:38] <ankush> supsup, gaa : any help on my query. please.
[09:15:38] <supsup> trying to think of a plugin name
[09:16:54] <xertion> hey guys. I'm doing a drag-n-drop design tool that creates html elements. I then save the HTML of the design in a database to be able to load later on. When I load the HTML into the page,
[09:17:11] <xertion> when I load the HTML into the page again from the database, the div's and other things no longer have .click, .draggable and so on again.
[09:17:28] <xertion> I've used delegate(); but it does not seem to work when I load HTML from the database.
[09:17:31] <inad922> hello
[09:17:34] <xertion> Any ideas how I should solve this?
[09:18:05] <inad922> How can I get the last child of a given element with a selector? ':last-child' doesn't seem to work... Gives back a list.
[09:18:32] <Elrinth2> anyone know a good regexp to fix image tag?
[09:19:00] <supsup> ankush: perhaps: https://github.com/Widen/fine-uploader
[09:19:10] <Elrinth2> <div><img a bunch of attributes here ></div> -> <div><img a bunch of attributes here /></div>
[09:20:21] <BillCriswell> Elrinth2: You can chain attribute selectors. $('img[attr1][attr2][attr3]')
[09:20:23] <supsup> inad922: perhaps .index() and .length
[09:21:10] <supsup> xertion, try adding the library via console command to see if you can attach events, if you can your just using your delegate wrong
[09:21:58] <xertion> supsup: I solved it, I was setting delegate() on a div that is replaced from the one from the database.
[09:21:58] <xertion> so that div was new aswell.
[09:22:01] <xertion> so I just put it on the parent that is never replaced.
[09:23:33] <inad922> supsup: thx
[09:24:35] <Dreamwinter> ugh my form is ignoring my radio buttons and I have 0 idea why.
[09:24:45] <gaa> supsup: on http://jsbin.com/ikeyez/3 the number of persons field is displayed at first even when 'single person' is selected
[09:24:56] <gaa> it disappears only when we select it manually again
[09:25:24] <supsup> gaa: css rule waswrong
[09:25:25] <supsup> http://jsbin.com/ikeyez/4/
[09:25:29] <supsup> forgot #
[09:25:43] <Dreamwinter> When you set a var in JS the default value is 0 right?
[09:25:57] <supsup> also i only did two examples you have to do the rest, that label you don't need to repeat as well if you don't want to
[09:26:01] <Dreamwinter> Like if an accurate value doesn't pass to the var
[09:32:07] <supsup> no set to undefined.
[09:36:19] <supsup> Dreamwinter: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined
[09:37:23] <Dreamwinter> Well then this makes no sense lol
[09:37:43] <supsup> sure it does, you just don't understand it.
[09:38:09] <Dreamwinter> I'm trying to obtain the value of an input field, which works for text boxes I have but it appears to ignore radio boxes
[09:38:34] <supsup> make jsfiddle example
[09:38:37] <gaa> supsup: now the field doesn't appear for *any* selection
[09:38:38] <supsup> sure you will get help then
[09:42:09] <josh3336> hi if  i have a bunch of div statements in html and i use a $(document).ready(function(){} to append more div statements for some reason the $('div').on('click',function(){} only works on the initial div statements and not the newly created ones.  how can i fix this?
[09:42:26] <Nicolas_Leonidas> hi
[09:42:37] <Xal_> O
[09:42:38] <Xal_> O
[09:42:55] <jonez> greetings. I need some help using timepicker. I have two date fields, and I want to be sure that the first field is not after the 2nd field. I've tried binding to onSelect and changing different params (maxDate and maxHour both). no luck so far. any help? :)
[09:43:08] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I'm using this to hide certain images before they are loaded http://pastebin.com/SdyeHyeL
[09:43:11] <utroda> josh3366 try $('body').on('click', 'div', function(){});
[09:43:23] <anew> can i only attach facebox onto <a> tags ?
[09:43:24] <Nicolas_Leonidas> but it's a hit and miss sometimes the function isn't called for some images
[09:43:34] <anew> i need to attach it to <input>
[09:43:56] <Xal_> I'm trying to use the UI datepicker, but I can't figure out how to get it to pop up when I click on the textbox instead of the button. I don't really need the button at all.
[09:44:01] <Nicolas_Leonidas> how do I do this better?
[09:46:06] <supsup> gaa: http://jsfiddle.net/3Zy7j/1/ --> switched to jsfiddle
[09:46:11] <supsup> don't like layout of that other site
[09:47:26] <josh3336> utroda: interesting that worked
[09:47:40] <d0100> Im trying to append html to a sourceless iframe, but it just appears then dissappears
[09:47:53] <josh3336> utroda: why is that? does it not get updated or something?
[09:48:00] <kzurawel> josh3336: what you just did is set up a click listener on the <body> element, that only responds when the actual thing clicked is a div
[09:48:37] <josh3336> kzurawel: how is that different from $('div').on('click',function(){}
[09:48:38] <kzurawel> josh3336: even when you add new divs inside of body, the click handler doesn't change.
[09:48:41] <supsup> off to lunch laterz
[09:48:51] <kzurawel> josh3336: $('div') only selects divs that currently exist on the page
[09:48:59] <utroda> josh3366: from the jquery docs for on, When a selector is provided, the event handler is referred to as delegated. The handler is not called when the event occurs directly on the bound element, but only for descendants (inner elements) that match the selector.
[09:49:41] <josh3336> utroda: cool thanks a lot
[09:49:51] <josh3336> kzurawel: thanks to you also
[09:50:01] <utroda> josh3336: np man
[09:51:38] <hxm> hello i have this http://pastebin.com/EsrPsfs5 which works, but when i change the regexp to /[0-9a-z]/ it does nothing
[09:53:47] <Xal_> Ok, I figured out how to set the datepicker options. Here's another issue, though. If I'm setting a calendar on multiple textboxes, do I have to set them separately? I have $("input[rel=datetimepicker]").datepicker(),  with two textboxes that match that, and when I select a date for one, the date goes in both boxes.
[09:56:04] <trinode> if anyone knows much about the new panel in JQM and can help, my Q is also on stack overflow if you want rep points :)
[09:57:08] <shoky> Xal_: you don't need to set them seperately.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QRRZg/
[09:58:02] <shoky> Xal_: just make sure they don't have the same ID
[09:58:12] <Xal_> They don't have the same ID
[09:58:32] <shoky> then it works fine, as you can see
[09:59:43] <Xal_> Ok, then why is mine not working?
[09:59:53] <shoky> how should i know?
[10:00:12] <shoky> reproduce the issue on jsfiddle
[10:00:20] <shoky> or link to your site
[10:01:14] <Xal_> They're being generated dynamically on a user action, and I'm setting the datepicker after that. Also, I'm using a timepicker addon.
[10:01:26] <Dreamwinter> Huzzah.
[10:01:26] <BillCriswell> Ugh. I have to choose between VERY slow and easy vs fast and difficult
[10:01:29] <Dreamwinter> Everything is working :)
[10:01:48] <Dreamwinter> Now time to polish :)
[10:03:06] <shoky> Xal_: like i said.. make a testcase so we can see, otherwise it's all working perfect in our mind
[10:03:14] <Xal_> working on that now
[10:05:45] <shoky> BillCriswell: choose simple. whether slow or fast.  (simple !== easy)
[10:06:09] <shoky> (not that i have any idea what you're tlaking about)
[10:06:15] <BillCriswell> Either way I'd make sure it's simple haha.
[10:07:24] <shoky> then i'm all for it
[10:07:29] <BillCriswell> I just feel like I'm going to need to make a cache of a bunch of data that I really don't care to since I don't want to worry about keeping it updated. The time my boss quoted is WAY off for this task haha.
[10:08:08] <shoky> that doesn't sound simple ;[
[10:08:40] <trinode> Using one of those new panels, we've a "global menu" and when we switch page, we .detach() and .append() to the new page, but the overlay div and content wrapper div (for shifting the page when the panel is shown) are both still on the original page, what's the correct way to "move" a panel and have it redo it's initialisation on the new page?
[10:08:41] <BillCriswell> It's either that or making 10-120 individual API calls per page request. =(
[10:09:21] <shoky> dang
[10:09:47] <BillCriswell> I think a MySQL database  is the only way to keep it from taking actual seconds to load. The API wasn't designed to grab what I need in one request.
[10:10:25] <BillCriswell> You'd think you could request all products in a given category in one call, but I'll need to collect each products ID individually and request them that way.
[10:11:07] <BillCriswell> Bah.
[10:11:14] <shoky> sry bro
[10:11:16] <BillCriswell> Haha
[10:11:20] <BillCriswell> It's ok. =(
[10:12:16] <BillCriswell> It has getProducts(array('brand_id' => 23)); but not getProducts(array('category_id' => 2));
[10:12:21] <c4ptnh00k> Need help with an ajax call problem http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/yrUkv/ basically having trouble accessing the returned json object
[10:12:59] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: is datatype and its value case sensitive?
[10:13:34] <shoky> dataType: 'json'   plz
[10:13:44] <c4ptnh00k> ah
[10:13:52] <shoky> dataType is definitely case sensitive, not sure about the value
[10:14:00] <BillCriswell> That's the only thing that jumps out at me.. without seeing the http headers at least.
[10:14:22] <BillCriswell> I'd imagine the dataType is the problem though.
[10:15:08] <c4ptnh00k> hmm basically seems like data is undefined when I am trying to assign these lbl values
[10:15:30] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Is the response sent as application/json?
[10:16:02] <shoky> c4ptnh00k check the request/response in your devtools..
[10:16:46] <shoky> and what do you mean, "seems like" ?
[10:16:53] <c4ptnh00k> return statement = return Json(client, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
[10:17:06] <anew> jQuery.facebox({ ajax: 'http://site.com/users/buttonlogin/' });  i'm trying to use facebox, when i enter this... it never displays the remote page.  am i using this config properly ?
[10:17:18] <anew> http://defunkt.io/facebox/
[10:17:20] <anew> from here
[10:17:32] <c4ptnh00k> seems like means it is ...
[10:17:36] <c4ptnh00k> sorry
[10:17:37] <shoky> c4ptnh00k:  check the actual request/response in your browser's devtools network tab.. not in your server code
[10:18:20] <anew> i *think this setting should be serving the remote page, but i'm not seeing anything
[10:18:40] <c4ptnh00k> yeah I get the response as [{"id":1048,"name":"Test","phone":"5555555555","phone2":null,"sbt":"TEST"   ...and so on
[10:18:57] <c4ptnh00k> thats how i expect it
[10:19:01] <shoky> c4ptnh00k:  and console.log('response data:', data)   gives you what?
[10:19:11] <G00d455> oooh, baby
[10:19:29] <shoky> oh
[10:19:30] <G00d455> any gays nigga's in here
[10:19:32] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: your json is an array
[10:19:36] <anew> shoky can u help
[10:19:39] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: but you're treating it as an object..
[10:19:54] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Look at the actual headers though as well just in case. Network tab.
[10:20:17] <shoky> content type doesn't really matter if you set dataType, afaik

[10:24:58] <ajpiano> sorry about that all
[10:25:04] <ajpiano> just got back to the computer
[10:25:07] <Xal_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enSYlCEz5VI
[10:25:08] <shoky> c4ptnh00k:  it's not an object, it's an array.... treat it like one
[10:25:14] <ajpiano> i wonder if that's the same troll from yesterday
[10:25:18] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: WHAT DO WE PAY YOU FOR
[10:25:22] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: and don't lie next time and say it's undefined ;]
[10:25:38] <c4ptnh00k> lol
[10:25:41] <iliketurtles> What would be the ideal way to determine when the FIRST key press occurs in a <form>? I don't really care what key was pressed, just that someone began entering text in a <form>
[10:25:51] <c4ptnh00k> fair enough
[10:25:54] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: It must suck having nothing to do but bother people in #jquery. =(
[10:26:00] <ajpiano> yah, seriously
[10:26:31] <ajpiano> shoky: i just gave you ops
[10:26:49] <ajpiano> as i am at a conf right now and not realyl around the comp too much
[10:26:59] <BillCriswell> Living the dream.
[10:27:33] <shoky> cool, thanks ajpiano ;]
[10:28:05] <ajpiano> :) gotta keep the peace
[10:28:48] <shoky> just testin'
[10:28:58] <BillCriswell> Flexing those IRC muscles.
[10:29:05] <rmill> hnnnngh
[10:29:14] <shoky> *crack*pop*
[10:29:47] <c4ptnh00k> shoky: how would I make that return as an object instead of an array?
[10:30:05] <BillCriswell> data = data[0];
[10:30:17] <BillCriswell> I fink.
[10:30:21] <BillCriswell> I was following kinda...
[10:30:42] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: ^ that.. or fix it serverside to output an object and not an array
[10:33:30] <BillCriswell> holy shit i don't want to work anymore.
[10:33:49] <c4ptnh00k> I appreciate the help shoky and bill. That was def stupid of me. at the end it clicked that the client "object" was actually an array from a resulting query on the back end.
[10:33:51] <shoky> let's go to hawaii-ee
[10:33:51] <jedimind> BillCriswell welcome to adulthood
[10:34:06] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: Agreed
[10:34:16] <shoky> np c4ptnh00k
[10:34:30] <BillCriswell> adulthood sucks.
[10:34:40] <BillCriswell> No problem c4ptnh00k.
[10:34:57] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: I am ready to retire.
[10:35:09] <Xal_> It does suck, but it still beats high school
[10:35:30] <c4ptnh00k> I cant even remember highschool. That was like 10 years ago
[10:35:32] <BillCriswell> Hawaii sounds fun.
[10:35:41] <Xal_> 25 for me
[10:35:53] <BillCriswell> It's not TOO hot there, right? Cause Philly is a sweat box right now.
[10:36:04] <BillCriswell> 28... I'm getting old.
[10:36:15] <c4ptnh00k> ... same lol
[10:36:45] <jedimind> 32 and counting
[10:36:54] <c4ptnh00k> well then stop counting
[10:36:59] <BillCriswell> I looked this up randomly this morning... it was one of my more interesting random Wikipedia lookups: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Crack_Corn
[10:37:31] <c4ptnh00k> wow thats boredom
[10:37:34] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Was 30 as bad as I'm thinking?
[10:37:54] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: I always learn something interesting when I'm bored on the el.
[10:38:03] <jedimind> BillCriswell its definitely worse
[10:38:17] <BillCriswell> Damn.
[10:38:17] <c4ptnh00k> hmm chicago was fun
[10:38:44] <c4ptnh00k> I'm not looking forward to 30 at all
[10:39:02] <jedimind> its not fun at all, my balls instantly sagged an extra inch the day i turned 30
[10:39:33] <c4ptnh00k> amyone live in the seattle area?
[10:39:38] <c4ptnh00k> anyone*
[10:40:00] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Brutal. =(
[10:40:05] <c4ptnh00k> I am thinking about moving there
[10:40:19] <jedimind> c4ptnh00k do you like rain and misery ?
[10:40:48] <c4ptnh00k> I like temps no higher than the low 80s on average. which is not the case in the south
[10:41:05] <BillCriswell> I like Twin Peaks.
[10:41:47] <shoky> gotta watch that again
[10:42:31] <BillCriswell> shoky: I've watched it a bunch. Weird addiction.
[10:43:11] <BillCriswell> https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=4mf_yNLlgic#! It sucks I just watched this now. =/
[10:43:17] <shoky> only watched it 1st time a couple years ago, it's so excellent
[10:43:19] <c4ptnh00k> Bill did you mean the show or san fran?
[10:43:33] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: The show.
[10:43:46] <c4ptnh00k> :(
[10:47:10] <c4ptnh00k> Now for the only thing I enjoy about my 830-530... Lunch break
[10:47:21] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Haha
[10:50:52] <Yeretik> Hi, anybody can offer me a good reference to create a floating menu bar like linkedin.com ?
[10:51:21] <not_mike> sec
[10:51:22] <Yeretik> I've been searching more than 2 hours and didn't find anything
[10:51:30] <not_mike> let me see what you're talking abotu
[10:51:57] <Yeretik> not_mike, Thanks
[10:51:58] <BillCriswell> Yeretik: position: fixed;
[10:52:02] <not_mike> are you talking abou position:fixed;?
[10:52:34] <Yeretik> No, the menu bar... the second
[10:53:00] <Yeretik> that scrolls up and hide and appear when scrolls down
[10:53:03] <diamonds> $(asdf).fadeIn(1000).then(... < why doesn't this work?
[10:53:18] <diamonds> I find the deferred api and it's relation to the rest of jquery confusing af
[10:53:52] <not_mike> both are position:fixed; for me. what browser are you using? so I can see what you are seeing
[10:54:04] <not_mike> (@yeretik)
[10:54:11] <BillCriswell> Yeretik: Are you looking at it on a mobile device or something?
[10:54:24] <Yeretik> iceweasel, firefox (not the same), chrome
[10:54:40] <Yeretik> BillCriswell, No
[10:54:50] <BillCriswell> It's just always fixed here.
[10:55:16] <Yeretik> not_mike, It's when you are logged in
[10:56:08] <Yeretik> The essence is: when you scrolls down, the bar move up and dissappear
[10:56:12] <not_mike> I've been logged in lol
[10:56:24] <not_mike> I'll try in firefox? I've been using chrome
[10:56:25] <BillCriswell> Yeretik: I can not duplicate that behavoir.
[10:56:50] <BillCriswell> Are you on a pro account or something along those lines?
[10:57:13] <Yeretik> And, when you scrolls up, wherever be the scroll position, the bar moves down and appear
[10:57:13] <not_mike> same thing
[10:57:25] <Yeretik> BillCriswell, No, a common account
[10:57:34] <BillCriswell> I don'tknow then.
[10:57:41] <not_mike> do you know of any other sites that do this? I think I know what you're talking about but I want to make sure, Yeretik
[10:58:05] <Yeretik> This behavior exactly, i'm not sure
[11:00:13] <Yeretik> not_mike, I'm tlking about the bar (when you're logged in), that have "Home    Profile   Network    Jobs    Interests"
[11:00:24] <Yeretik> not_mike, You know what i'm say?
[11:01:05] <BillCriswell> Yeretik: This thing isn't hiding.
[11:01:21] <not_mike> Yea, I see that bar, it is floaring right under the top bar for me the hold time, regardless of where you are scrolled on the page
[11:01:24] <not_mike> floating*
[11:01:29] <not_mike> whole*
[11:01:45] <not_mike> sec
[11:01:59] <Yeretik> Exactly !
[11:02:14] <BillCriswell> Yeretik: http://jsbin.com/ufaxil/2/edit this?
[11:03:11] <diamonds> how the hell do you use deferreds with animations
[11:03:21] <diamonds> why doesn't $().animate().then() work?!?
[11:04:06] <jedimind> you just do it in the callback of the animation diamonds
[11:04:15] <diamonds> callback
[11:04:17] <diamonds> so no promises
[11:04:19] <diamonds> oh whell
[11:04:21] <Yeretik> not_mike, red bar doesn't move on scroll
[11:07:00] <not_mike> yeretik: we still talking about linkedin here? I don't see a red bar. Right now I'm trying to find a site that I think does the same thing that you are talking about.
[11:09:04] <Yeretik> Uffff... The red bar comment was for BillCriswell
[11:09:27] <BillCriswell> Yeretik: I have no clue what you want.
[11:10:11] <BillCriswell> Holy shit today is slow.
[11:10:12] <diamonds> well that's not exiting at all
[11:10:18] <diamonds> it's the same as callbacks
[11:11:44] <BillCriswell> diamonds: What are you trying to accomplish?
[11:11:55] <diamonds> BillCriswell» chaining animations
[11:12:58] <BillCriswell> So wait for one to finish, do the next?
[11:13:12] <diamonds> yeah
[11:13:15] <BillCriswell> Paul Irish wrote a nice simple approach to this: http://www.paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[11:13:20] <diamonds> with a nice clean pretty chained api
[11:14:41] <diamonds> this is all for the same animation on a group of objects, sequentially
[11:14:56] <diamonds> kewl, but very narrow solution
[11:15:02] <diamonds> (doesn't speak to my situation right now)
[11:18:15] <not_mike> sorry, battery went out
[11:18:19] <not_mike> yeretik, you still there?
[11:19:30] <shoky> diamonds: https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/54829d408993526fe475
[11:20:53] <diamonds> shoky» so use the 'done' callback, correct?
[11:21:50] <naeluh> hey I am wondering why this wouldnt work ? http://jsfiddle.net/GspPH/
[11:21:53] <BillCriswell> Sucks that's a "Secret" gist haha
[11:22:30] <naeluh> any ideas it will do visibility:hidden; but wont go back to visible ?
[11:22:33] <BillCriswell> naeluh: That shoudl work. It might not be doing what you want though.
[11:23:03] <naeluh> BillCriswell: yeah it works but it wont go back to visible on the other click .back
[11:23:25] <BillCriswell> Are you sure the button has the class "action" on it?
[11:23:35] <BillCriswell> or whatever you're using to trigger the event.
[11:23:49] <naeluh> <a href="" class="action back"><span>Back to Map</span></a>
[11:24:03] <shoky> diamonds:  var promise = $.Animation(element, {top: 500}, {duration: 1000});
[11:24:13] <naeluh> BillCriswell: thats what it looks like
[11:24:23] <diamonds> shoky» then you can chian with promise.then()?
[11:24:48] <shoky> diamonds: it's a promise, yes
[11:24:56] <naeluh> either way if I put the a or not it still wont return to visible on click
[11:25:57] <diamonds> shoky» can you chain with .then()?
[11:26:07] <diamonds> oh you have to call $.Animation directly
[11:26:13] <diamonds> I'll try that
[11:26:29] <shoky> diamonds: you can chain things to promises with .then() yes..
[11:26:29] <BillCriswell> naeluh: http://jsfiddle.net/GspPH/1/ have it working here.
[11:28:23] <shoky> diamonds: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bAgCu/1/
[11:28:54] <Yeretik> not_mike, I'm back
[11:28:55] <diamonds> shoky» thanks!!
[11:29:02] <diamonds> that's what I'm looking for
[11:29:46] <shoky> gnarf has taken good care of us
[11:30:13] <naeluh> BillCriswell: weird yeah it still does the same thing it just wont reappear?

[11:33:44] <shoky> <3
[11:35:31] <BillCriswell> Damn shoky, tearing up Twitter.
[11:35:59] <shoky> lol ;]
[11:38:32] <BillCriswell> We had some social media company dude come in and it was terrible. He kept saying "titter" instead of "twitter".
[11:38:49] <supsup> you titter bro
[11:38:55] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[11:38:59] <shoky> :)
[11:39:20] <supsup> i wish our social media guy said titter.
[11:40:27] <jonez> greetings. I have a project to use jqueryui's slider widget in "range" mode (two handles). what is the proper way to configure the slider so that the 2nd handle's value can never be less than the 1st field's value?
[11:41:00] <jonez> I tried binding to onChange and using the 'option' method to change max, but it does not seem to change anything
[11:41:23] <jedimind> jonez it does that by default no?
[11:41:29] <jedimind> you mean so you cant take the right handle and move it past the left handle?
[11:41:42] <supsup> by default i think it's like that
[11:41:43] <jedimind> http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/slider/range.html
[11:41:44] <jonez> jedimind,  yes. and vice-versa
[11:41:51] <jedimind> yeah it does that by default
[11:41:55] <jonez> oh. ok.
[11:42:05] <jedimind> or http://jqueryui.com/slider/#range for more information
[11:42:25] <supsup> otherwise it would not be a range i think
[11:42:30] <supsup> a null range?
[11:42:34] <jedimind> it would break the universe
[11:42:43] <jedimind> it would divide by zero and then everything would explode
[11:42:43] <cwatson> dividing by zero
[11:42:45] <cwatson> lol
[11:42:47] <jedimind> jquery is powerful
[11:42:53] <jedimind> dont mess with it
[11:42:53] <jonez> heh. good point. I mixed up my different revisions. at the moment I am using two sliders instead of one slider with two handles
[11:43:46] <cwatson> Meh, there is a lot of things in space that defy the laws of physics and I'm still alive.
[11:43:54] <supsup> are you?
[11:43:56] <cwatson> <--- proud
[11:43:59] <supsup> maybe.
[11:44:34] <cwatson> are*
[11:45:24] <cwatson> supsup: The matrix is so 1999, lol jk
[11:45:45] <supsup> what you should of asked for is an extension to the range widget that lets you reverse the points.  so it would become everything Not in the range instead of stuff in the range.
[11:46:14] <cwatson> And we should of just said 42.
[11:46:15] <supsup> the colors would inverse on that widget page
[11:46:21] <supsup> i still live in 1999
[11:47:15] <BillCriswell> I'm giving up hope for finding a new job.
[11:47:17] <supsup> dang that still would not be it.  so nm anyway
[11:47:21] <jonez> supsup, I'm keeping track of a start and end time. I don't want the two handles to cross. at the moment I am using one slider for each field, when I need to have one slider with two handles that populates the form fields.
[11:51:33] <supsup> they should make an imaginary range.  then you could do it
[11:51:54] <supsup> mother f'n degree revolution will do the trip yep yep.
[11:52:06] <supsup> trick*
[11:53:34] <supsup> would only work if your start point is > the video start tho and the rotation lands less than the video start, for this hypothetical feature you do not want.
[11:55:22] <supsup> Adafruit has Raspberry pi cameras in stock for another 15 minutes or so
[11:58:31] <karlpinc> Hi.  I've a table cell that I'm changing the content of and I want the cell width to be static.  One of the content variants has an image in it.  What's the right way to get the width ensuring that the image has been loaded?  Do I set the content to one variant and use a .load() function that then sets the content to the other variant and again has a .load() function that compares the widths?
[11:59:51] <iliketurtles> I'm trying to use the jquery .submit() function and callback inside a normal JS function.  It works fine submitting the form using $(form).submit(), but as soon as I throw a callback function inside submit, ie. $(form).submit(function() { console.log('submitting'); } ); then the form no longer submits
[12:03:04] <supsup> try return true after console.log
[12:03:32] <karlpinc> Come to think of it, both content varients contain images.
[12:04:16] <gnarf> diamonds: also worth mentioning about .then()
[12:04:38] <gnarf> .then( naturalCompletion, stoppedCompletion( gotoEnd ) )
[12:04:46] <diamonds> ty
[12:04:55] <supsup> karlpinc $("#imageID").width() ?
[12:04:59] <c4ptnh00k> iliketurtles: should try adding a return statement like supsup suggested.
[12:05:05] <gnarf> diamonds: so if it gets .stop(true) - the "fail" functions run
[12:05:22] <karlpinc> supsup: It's not _just_ an image inside the table cell.
[12:05:34] <supsup> karlpinc make jsfiddle
[12:06:03] <Interbit> So if I have an a form and I do $("#formID").submit
[12:06:27] <Interbit> is this suppose to be the same as me doing .click on the input button which does submit i the html?
[12:06:59] <christophe_v_e> Hi, I'm looking to only load and play an HTML5 video when the thumbnail is clicked. Any suggestions?
[12:07:25] <DJTrey> apparently this isn't the right syntax for my jquery ajax call - var userObject = <cfoutput>'#VARIABLES.sso.customer#'</cfoutput>; any ideas?
[12:08:38] <supsup> christophe_v_e : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video
[12:09:07] <iliketurtles> c4ptnh00k: thanks, that works
[12:09:22] <iliketurtles> c4ptnh00k: however, I'm trying to run a mixpanel.track function in the submit callback, and it doesn't seem to be firing;  any idea why that might be?
[12:09:47] <iliketurtles> ie. $(form).submit(function() { mixpanel.track("blah"); return true; } ) is not getting run
[12:10:08] <supsup> can u call mixpanel.track("blah") from the console?
[12:10:15] <supsup> if not your prob missing something on global scope
[12:10:20] <iliketurtles> supsup: yes that works fine
[12:10:36] <karlpinc> supsup: I'm not sure I understand.  You're saying that $('<img src="foo">').width() will block until the image is loaded?
[12:10:56] <supsup> karlpinc: not sure what your reffing
[12:11:04] <c4ptnh00k> iliketurtles: check you calls. cant diagnose much without being able to test it. Maybe mock up a jsfiddle
[12:11:09] <karlpinc> supsup: make jsfiddle
[12:11:24] <karlpinc> supsup: And your reference to .width().
[12:11:26] <supsup> how do you go from that to something about blocking?
[12:11:41] <karlpinc> supsup: Because I don't know what I'm doing?
[12:12:04] <supsup> well the first thing is to learn how to make an example in jsfiddle.
[12:12:18] <karlpinc> supsup: Ok.  I don't know what jsfiddle is.
[12:12:23] <karlpinc> supsup: I'll go look.
[12:12:42] <christophe_v_e> Thank you supsup, I read that but I'm not sure how I would keep it from buffering until clicked with this..
[12:13:16] <supsup> on video element have preload=none?
[12:13:27] <karlpinc> supsup: (Although this is part of a larger project and I'm a bit reluctant to introduce a whole new api, or whatever just to solve this one problem.)
[12:13:44] <coldhead`> you couldn't just google that, supsup?
[12:13:55] <supsup> i'm not asking a question
[12:14:13] <supsup> he could of read the article I linked him tho sure.
[12:14:30] <supsup> guess i typed it wrong
[12:14:31] <s3b`> Hey! What would be the most optimized way to move an entire <div id="foo"> and place it into <div id="bar">
[12:14:46] <s3b`> I'm cloning it to another variable, appending it, and then removing the original bar. is there a better way?
[12:14:53] <s3b`> original foo*
[12:15:06] <supsup> karlpinc: use your imagination on how to break up your problem into a small example.  then you don't have to go into crazy detail on your top secret app.
[12:15:39] <supsup> read channel description too this is the common way to ask for help
[12:16:37] <christophe_v_e> supsup: I thought the preload was for audio only?
[12:16:57] <supsup> ahh i think your right too sorry.
[12:17:29] <supsup> perhaps build the video html...when they press the button christophe
[12:18:36] <skypce> hello
[12:18:37] <karlpinc> supsup: Fortunately, the app is oss.  https://github.com/kpinc/phppgadmin/blob/sigenhance/js/database.js  Lines 20-30 are racey on whether the images are loaded.
[12:18:39] <skypce> i have this site
[12:18:49] <christophe_v_e> Ok, any pointers on how I would do that?
[12:18:53] <christophe_v_e> I'm really new to this
[12:19:09] <skypce> http://skypce.chickenkiller.com/webcanteras/cocina.php how can resolve conflict of js files?
[12:19:17] <skypce> i was testing with noconflict
[12:19:25] <skypce> but dont work for me
[12:21:37] <supsup> karlpinc: yah i don't get that code, to me it seems like the if condition would never be true.
[12:22:04] <supsup> o nm maybe it would be
[12:22:14] <karlpinc> You might also see lines 661-672 of https://github.com/kpinc/phppgadmin/blob/sigenhance/database.php
[12:22:31] <christophe_v_e> supsup: turns out the video tag has a preload attribute
[12:22:34] <gnarf> diamonds: shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/bAgCu/2/
[12:22:40] <supsup> yah i don't know it would be a lot easier just to make a small example of what you want then have to read this lib.
[12:22:42] <iliketurtles> c4ptnh00k: only my form submit action happens (return true), nothing else: https://gist.github.com/Lordnibbler/5680227
[12:22:55] <supsup> christophe : cool
[12:22:58] <karlpinc> supsup: The php is just setting up the ajax call....
[12:23:13] <diamonds> gnarf» thanks
[12:23:27] <supsup> yah but i don't have a working example of what is wrong.  I'd have to figure out what your trying to do in the first place
[12:23:29] <gnarf> oops diamonds shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/bAgCu/3/
[12:23:37] <gnarf> forgot its (animation, gotoEnd)
[12:23:44] <karlpinc> supsup: I understand.  But the problem is I don't know the way to do it.  Let me try again....
[12:23:58] <supsup> look at how gnarf did one
[12:24:08] <gnarf> first arg to both functions are "anim"
[12:24:19] <gnarf> success and fail and progress actually
[12:24:22] <sekyms> Is there a good way around the IE 7 not supporting window.location.search?
[12:24:23] <c4ptnh00k> iliketurtles: honestly dont know
[12:24:24] <gnarf> first arg for all of em is the anim
[12:24:26] <gnarf> this === the element
[12:24:53] <diamonds> I have a collection of elems
[12:24:57] <iliketurtles> c4ptnh00k: blast
[12:24:59] <diamonds> and I want to delegate bind to them
[12:25:11] <diamonds> fb = $('.foo, .bar')
[12:25:26] <diamonds> can I $body.on('click',fb,function()...)?
[12:25:31] <gnarf> diamonds: no
[12:25:35] <gnarf> but you can
[12:25:37] <diamonds> how delegate bind to the collection
[12:26:16] <supsup> iliketurtles:  it's odd if you can  do the call in console.  the console.log does not come out either?
[12:26:28] <Interbit> I have two seperate php files
[12:26:33] <gnarf> diamonds: $body.on('click', function() { if ( !$(event.target).closest(fb) ) { return; } // ...... });
[12:26:36] <iliketurtles> supsup: nope, none of it comes up in console :|
[12:26:37] <Interbit> which handle two seperate forms
[12:26:46] <Interbit> can can i submit them both with one button click ?
[12:26:47] <diamonds> gnarf» ha! nice
[12:26:56] <diamonds> I'll just absract the selector and use it twice
[12:27:17] <Interbit> using jquery ofc ^^
[12:27:24] <gnarf> er you need a .length on that closest
[12:27:25] <gnarf> anyway
[12:27:27] <gnarf> lets try this
[12:27:38] <supsup> iliketurtles : are you sure you have the right selector?
[12:27:44] <supsup> put a return false in there instead
[12:27:52] <supsup> and see if the form is still submitting
[12:28:05] <gnarf> $body.on("click", function(event) { var thing = $(event.target).closest(selector); if (!thing.length) { return; } .... });
[12:28:07] <gnarf> diamonds: ^
[12:28:10] <supsup> it's odd how you are using dom to get form then switch to jquery
[12:28:22] <supsup> to me at least
[12:28:25] <diamonds> gnarf» that's how the delegation works internally more or less, no?
[12:28:36] <gnarf> diamonds: yeah - though i think it uses an optimized version of closest
[12:28:45] <gnarf> but really
[12:28:46] <gnarf> at that point
[12:28:50] <gnarf> if you're using a selector
[12:29:00] <gnarf> you can just $body.on("click", selector
[12:29:19] <supsup> iliketurtles: is there an ID on the form?  if so then just do $form = $("#formid") and then $form.submit
[12:29:45] <gnarf> diamonds: so like, just use the selector :)
[12:29:50] <karlpinc> Basically, I want to get the maximum .css('width') (by comparing .width()) of two hunks of html.  Neither of which is in the dom at the same time and both of which contain images and other stuff.  The problem is I need the images pre-loaded.  But how to tell when they are loaded?  Can I just make $('<img src="foo">') objects and call .load() on them?  But what's a sane way to get an event only when all images are loaded?  Enforcing
[12:29:50] <karlpinc> serialization seems ... wrong.  But I'm confused by how to tell they're loaded if I load them asychronously.
[12:30:09] <supsup> there is a load event
[12:30:11] <supsup> on images
[12:30:11] <gnarf> diamonds: if you want to match against a collection you're maintaining in a var, you can still use the closest method
[12:30:20] <gnarf> `imagesLoaded
[12:30:26] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded
[12:30:27] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[12:30:29] <diamonds> gnarf» selector = 'abc', $collection = $(selector); $body.on('click',selector...
[12:30:32] <christophe_v_e> I have a followup question: I have my video I want to play in a jqueryui selectable. So when I click my video .. it selects it .. but it won't play, since it is still using the selectable. Can I bind this somehow? See the first item: http://vaneerdt.be/app/step1.php
[12:30:37] <supsup> ah nice even better
[12:30:37] <diamonds> ^seems simplest
[12:30:49] <gnarf> diamonds: exactly
[12:30:51] <shoky> hmm gnarf, is that fiddle doing what you intended? that gotoEnd argument is always undefined, even if you do $(div).stop(true,true)
[12:30:59] <gnarf> shoky: check /3/
[12:31:07] <shoky> i am
[12:31:18] <gnarf> if its .stop() gotoEnd is false
[12:31:27] <karlpinc> supsup: I don't really want to load them serially, one after the other, so I can tell when they're all loaded.  I'll look at the url.  Thanks.
[12:31:48] <supsup> yah that plugin seems cool.
[12:33:02] <shoky> gnarf: i don't get it, heh. the button is just supposed to stop it?
[12:33:18] <gnarf> shoky: change the button to just .stop()
[12:33:20] <gnarf> it will stop
[12:33:42] <shoky> right, but what does that .fail(..) do?
[12:35:09] <karlpinc> It does seem cool.  But it seems I'll still have to tell the browser to first load one set of images, then the next, and so forth.  Because all my images are in the same element, so I'll have to cycle through the various contents.  It'd be nice to let the browser load asychronously.
[12:36:07] <karlpinc> Could I throw the various content into different hidden elements and do it that way?
[12:36:43] <karlpinc> (The sub-question being, do images load when in hidden elements?)
[12:37:37] <supsup> yep.  you could load them offscreen.  it seems like that lib can target a container tho
[12:37:45] <shoky> gnarf:  it only works for the last $.Animation i think
[12:38:00] <gnarf> hrm
[12:38:01] <torbjorn> with a buttonset, isnt there any easy way to figure out the value of the checked button?
[12:38:03] <gnarf> shoky: oh yeah
[12:38:12] <shoky> gnarf: actually no it doesnt heh
[12:38:14] <gnarf> shoky: been a while: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L144
[12:38:42] <shoky> ohh
[12:38:44] <gnarf> so .stop(true) goes to the then function
[12:40:14] <thibauts> how can i proxy calls, so $('#myid').foo() calls $('#myid').get(0).foo() ?
[12:41:05] <gnarf> shoky: hrm
[12:41:11] * gnarf shrugs
[12:41:18] <Dreamwinter> Welp I started learning JS/Jquery this morning and I believe my project is a success
[12:41:20] <Dreamwinter> http://qrcrossing.com/siggen/
[12:41:34] * shoky hugs gnarf
[12:42:08] <shoky> thibauts:  $.fn.foo = function() { return this.get(0).foo() }      ?
[12:42:36] <dcherman> shoky: infinite loop right thar :(
[12:42:36] <sekyms> developer.mozilla compatibility chart is terrible
[12:42:44] <jedimind> Dreamwinter i disagree
[12:42:45] <jedimind> but okay
[12:42:48] <shoky> dcherman: that's .get(0)   not .eq(0)
[12:43:11] <dcherman> shoky: back to lurking for me.  failed heckle :(
[12:43:15] <shoky> :P
[12:43:18] <Dreamwinter> jedimind, thanks for sharing!

[12:50:05] <dwarder> i have hard time finding it
[12:50:08] <dwarder> is there a simple tutorial to create a google chrome extension to send a form?
[12:55:00] <skypce> i have : http://skypce.chickenkiller.com/webcanteras/cocina.php
[12:55:17] <skypce> do you know where is loaded the jquery 1.4 ? the file thats load it please?
[13:06:29] <christophe`> Hey, I'm wondering how I'd play/pause any html5 video element that is clicked. And if one is clicked the other pauses.
[13:09:47] <uknownalgorithms> is this valid Jquery to change the background-image of a #div? jQuery('#logocontainer').css('background-image', 'images/redribbon.jpg');
[13:10:49] <BillCriswell> uknownalgorithms: You need the url() too.
[13:10:56] <BillCriswell> Gets everyone the first time!
[13:11:48] <uknownalgorithms> haha nice, so should it be?  'url('images/redribbon.jpg')'
[13:12:01] <chuwiey> hi all. is there any way for me to copy the callbacks registered on a deferred to a new deferred?
[13:12:32] <BillCriswell> uknownalgorithms: You can use " inside the 's or drop the ' quotes inside the 's all together
[13:12:38] <BillCriswell> I hope that made at least a little sense
[13:13:09] <uknownalgorithms> it did, thank you
[13:13:29] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:14:51] <Krambiorix> hi i just copied my web application to a vps server and when i do : $.get('./program/steps/export/exporttocaredocpopup.php?uid='+uid, function(data) {$('body').append('<div id="importdialog" >'+data+'</div>'); i get a 403 error in firebug... What can i do?!
[13:15:56] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Can you access that URL directly?
[13:16:05] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, no i can't
[13:16:32] <BillCriswell> Is there like.. weird permissions on the file?
[13:17:14] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, nope... -rwxr-xr-x 1 www-data www-data
[13:19:37] <aaas> newbie question: can someone help me understand some code?  i think im having a fundamental misunderstanding of how jquery works and this would be a big help.   on https://code.google.com/p/d7ux/source/browse/trunk/misc/ajax.js?r=220#293   line 288  where does 'ajax', 'response', 'status' come from
[13:21:05] <BillCriswell> aaas: They're supplied by jQuery
[13:21:27] <chuwiey> hi all. is there a way to copy the registered callbacks from a deferred to another?
[13:21:32] <aaas> BillCriswell thanks...but if i inspect $ i dont think i see them....though ill try again maybe im wrong
[13:21:51] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: If it's a 403 error it's just forbidden.
[13:22:21] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, i chmod-ed everything to 755
[13:23:53] <iliketurtles> supsup: sorry had to step out for a minute; yes I'm inheriting some messy code, and just trying to patch things up in the interim
[13:23:57] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, what do you mean "it's just forbidden" ?
[13:24:08] <jedimind> the authorities dont let him do it
[13:24:13] <jedimind> and he's not comfortable breaking the law
[13:24:20] <jedimind> so it's just forbidden, stop pushing him on it
[13:24:21] <jedimind> jesus
[13:24:30] <jedimind> some people
[13:25:15] <BillCriswell> That's what a 403 error is.
[13:25:22] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Haha
[13:25:28] <Krambiorix> jedimind, some people????
[13:25:42] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: You pushing me to break the law!
[13:25:45] <BillCriswell> Mwahahha
[13:25:54] <BillCriswell> I can't fucking wait to get home.
[13:26:56] <christophe`> I don't know what to do anymore, I can't figure this out. All I want is to get the ID of the video element above my button, I don't care if it's jQuery or plain js, I need to get this to work :s please have a look: http://vaneerdt.be/app/step1.php - Thank you so much.
[13:27:34] <BillCriswell> christophe`: $(this).prev('video').attr('id') ?
[13:27:54] <BillCriswell> Are you tlaking about that > / || button dealie?
[13:27:57] <christophe`> Well yes, but I can't seem to stick that right in .. and I don't know why.
[13:28:00] <christophe`> yes
[13:28:35] <christophe`> I've put that in now - and I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
[13:28:58] <aaas> BillCriswell  so i dont see it when i inspect $, but maybe im doing it at the wrong time.  is it a jquery object?  I'm looking through the jquery code and i see some mention of 'status' deep in the code.  So if I want to create a property how do i know to use those three (ajax, response, status)  i think i can call them whatever i want, right? so somewhere there is a function defined in the jquery code that has a function with those three ar
[13:28:58] <aaas> guments?
[13:29:11] <christophe`> I'm really new to this.
[13:32:43] <Krambiorix> ok anyone else who want to try to solve my problem?!
[13:33:10] <jstroem> Krambiorix: come again?
[13:33:46] <christophe`> I put it in like this: http://pastebin.com/eWnNVjnr
[13:35:27] <aaas> Krambiorix if you cant access it directly it's not jquery....can you access anything there? put any file there? what are the permissions of the directory? is it a symlink?  do you have shell access? if so log in as www-data and try and navigate to that dir one dir at a time and see where it gives you permission denied errors
[13:35:28] <BillCriswell> christophe`: Put a class on that button like... class="play"
[13:35:59] <BillCriswell> christophe`: Then you can do something like http://pastie.org/pastes/7985356/text
[13:36:11] <aaas> Krambiorix if still no go, then it's yoru web server, check the error.log access.log
[13:37:41] <christophe`> Ok, I'll try right now :)
[13:38:11] <BillCriswell> aaas: You're trying to understand it a little deeper than I understand it I think.
[13:40:04] <aaas> BillCriswell that's ok, thansk for trying...it is driving me up the wall...i run into these functions with arguments all the time, but no one seems to know.... i mean in most languages if you know about programming you can do some poor coding if you know the syntax, but this is one of those things whre if i got to the point i wanted to create a property for this command and I didn't ahve this example, how would I even know to use a function
[13:40:05] <aaas> with three arguments
[13:40:15] <aaas> ill probably post to stack exchange eventually
[13:41:46] <christophe`> BillCriswell:  Hooza!
[13:41:48] <christophe`> It works
[13:46:06] <BillCriswell> christophe`: Glad it works.
[13:49:45] <BillCriswell> aaas: I wouldn't know unless it was for documentation. Like a $.ajax({success: function( response, status, jqXHR ){}}); for instance.
[13:56:23] <BillCriswell> I should get paid for like... 16 hours today.. cause that's how long the day has felt.
[13:59:38] <christophe`> BillCriswell: any idea if my video has to load in it's entirity before it starts?
[14:00:11] <BillCriswell> I'm not tha familiar with the HTML5 video stuff. Should be a quick look up though. I highly doubt it.
[14:00:25] <christophe`> It seems they're not playing .. at all. But it worked with my shorter fragments..
[14:00:46] <boxmein> Hiya
[14:00:48] <boxmein> Anyone active?
[14:02:13] <kzurawel> boxmein: what's up
[14:02:14] <christophe`> Oh, BillCriswell - it seems when I have multiple it goes "undefined" TypeError: activeVideo is undefined (at least that's what I get http://vaneerdt.be/app/step1.php )
[14:02:49] <boxmein> Hi
[14:02:52] <boxmein> I was wondering..
[14:03:07] <boxmein> If I append a DOM element to another element will its children follow
[14:03:41] <christophe`> (I can't help you with taht boxmein - I would if I knew anything about this :x )
[14:03:44] <kzurawel> boxmein: yes. if you've got an element in the DOM already, and you use .append() to move it, it will move along with all its children
[14:04:09] <boxmein> $(".post-footer .post-controls").insertBefore($(".post-source")).remove(); should technically be what I wanted to do
[14:04:34] <christophe`> Somebody told me I'm getting the id of my video .. after I've already gotten the video - so the attribute part of the script could be left out. But then it suddenly says "activeVideo.pause();" is not a function, while pause is a standard function ..
[14:04:40] <boxmein> kzurawel: thank you
[14:04:55] <kzurawel> boxmein: anytime
[14:05:08] <BillCriswell> christophe`: Hmm..
[14:05:13] <boxmein> If you want to know, it's about what tumblr did with all the post controls
[14:05:25] <BillCriswell> I'm wondering what I was thinking with the code I sent you moments ago.. hate when that happens.
[14:05:53] <BillCriswell> var activeVideo = $(this).prev('video')[0]; should be what you want I think?
[14:06:06] <BillCriswell> Your videos don't seem to have ids now
[14:06:27] <BillCriswell> or I maybe made up the whole ID part?
[14:06:31] <BillCriswell> Either one would surprise me
[14:06:36] <christophe`> It is!
[14:06:48] <christophe`> It works - the [0] was missing.
[14:06:55] <christophe`> What does that do?
[14:07:14] <BillCriswell> It gets the video element before it in the source.
[14:07:19] <christophe`> My videos indeed don't have id's - but we're not getting id's, right? We're getting elements? I'm really not sure how this works..
[14:07:49] <christophe`> Good thing it works now though. Is is possible to pause all other videos when I start one .. with a simple command?
[14:07:52] <BillCriswell> christophe`: An id would just be an id attribute.
[14:08:03] <christophe`> Oh ok.
[14:09:44] <BillCriswell> $(this).prev()[0] should get the job done as well... not sure why you can apply a selector there now that I'm thinking about it.
[14:10:45] <walidvb> hi guys, I have a good one.
[14:10:59] <discorpia> don't think [0] is needed on .prev() but in general it's bette rto use .first() than [0]
[14:11:23] <christophe`> I might be putting some titles in between the video and the button, so .prev('video') is better, no?
[14:11:23] <walidvb> I'm trying to allow my users to navigate through my site (which is 10Kpxx10Kpx) like on google maps
[14:11:24] <BillCriswell> discorpia: The [0] gets the dom node. Not the first element.
[14:11:36] <walidvb> I would also like them to be able to zoom in and out.
[14:12:18] <walidvb> i use transform: scale for doing this, but I can't seem to find the way to keep the zoom centered on where i was!
[14:12:23] <walidvb> (there is a slider)
[14:12:37] <walidvb> live example: http://vbbros.net/aumbry
[14:12:49] <kzurawel> walidvb: there's a CSS3 rule called 'transform-origin'
[14:13:06] <kzurawel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin
[14:13:06] <walidvb> i tried that, but the origin has to change live
[14:13:12] <discorpia> BillCriswell: ah, missed that distinction. cool, thanks
[14:13:21] <jlang1> Greetings all, longtime jquery user and fan, new comer to the Jquery Channel.  I am facing an odd problem with a jquery mobile site I'm building it's only shown an issue with android 2.2 and the default browser.  I have a group of fieldsets with a label and select in each one. In android 2.2 when I press one of the drop downs button it is showing the native menu with the the options from the select tag that is after the the one that should've been shown. If that
[14:13:50] <kzurawel> walidvb: you'll need to calculate the "new" transform origin whenever the user scrolls (probably by comparing the full document's width/height to the viewport width/height)
[14:13:52] <walidvb> it has to be in what the middle of the viewport shows
[14:14:14] <walidvb> kzurawel: def. can't find the right combination, though :D
[14:14:34] <kzurawel> walidvb: How are you currently handling the scrolling? Are you changing a left:/top: value, or something else?
[14:14:44] <cwatson> Chrome does not support the .load() jQuery method? Weird.
[14:14:46] <walidvb> kzurawel: no, it's an overflow
[14:14:56] <kzurawel> oh so it has scrollbars....
[14:15:11] <walidvb> i have a .cont>.zoom>.content structure
[14:15:13] <walidvb> yes
[14:15:25] <walidvb> so i tried using scrollTop, too
[14:15:31] <shoky> cwatson: it sure does
[14:15:34] <walidvb> but it gets me nowhere close
[14:15:56] <kzurawel> walidvb: Right. scrollTop will get you the vertical offset; not sure how to deal with the horizontal offset though
[14:16:05] <cwatson> shoky: How? This is the only thing I have seen - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2990518/jquery-load-not-working-in-chrome
[14:16:06] <walidvb> well, same, why not?
[14:16:26] <walidvb> kzurawel: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9c6f100fcd57064a222e i have this so far
[14:17:06] <cwatson> shoky: It's also not working with a basic sample I created locally.
[14:17:10] <cwatson> It*
[14:17:14] <sekyms> any boston folks here?
[14:17:20] <shoky> cwatson: are you loading a local file from the file system?
[14:17:24] <shoky> cwatson: no web server?
[14:17:31] <cwatson> shoky: correct
[14:18:03] <shoky> cwatson: then you need that command line flag for chrome
[14:18:31] <kzurawel> walidvb: One potential error: What you get from scrollTop / outerHeight is just a number
[14:18:40] <kzurawel> walidvb: without a unit at the end, the browser doesn't know what to do with it.
[14:19:00] <cwatson> shoky: Ah, I'm so ignorant to Chrome. Thanks.
[14:19:05] <walidvb> 'px' is added auto
[14:19:39] <kzurawel> walidvb: Ok. You're better off though turning the scrollTop / scrollLeft into a percentage scrolled, though, then set the transform-origin to that percentage
[14:20:15] <kzurawel> walidvb: at least that's my opinion. :)
[14:20:19] <walidvb> percentage scrolled is what then?
[14:21:18] <kzurawel> walidvb: vertical percentage scrolled would be scrollTop divided by outerHeight
[14:21:23] <walidvb> (el.scrollTop -(el.outerHeight()-el.parent().height())/2)/el.outerHeight() or smth?
[14:21:36] <walidvb> hm ok
[14:22:03] <kzurawel> walidvb: I think yours is better - forgot that scrollTop gives you the... top, not the middle
[14:22:04] <walidvb> by container outerHeight. seems too simple
[14:22:21] <walidvb> kzurawel: ?
[14:22:46] <kzurawel> walidvb: so you'll need three numbers: the scroll position, the viewport height, and the document height
[14:23:29] <kzurawel> walidvb: (scrollTop + (0.5 * viewportHeight)) / documentHeight = % to use as your transform origin. (I think.)
[14:23:42] <walidvb> kzurawel: hehe let's see
[14:24:54] <walidvb> (scrollableContainer.scrollTop + contentHeight/2) / windowHeight, right?
[14:25:14] <kzurawel> walidvb: Swap content and window, I think.
[14:25:23] <walidvb> hm lets
[14:25:25] <kzurawel> walidvb: because your content is larger than the window, right?
[14:25:32] <walidvb> yes
[14:28:11] <jlang1> Any Jquery Mobile users here ?
[14:28:51] <jedimind> nope
[14:28:53] <jedimind> not a one
[14:28:56] <jedimind> anywhere, not just here
[14:30:12] <BillCriswell> Have a good night everyone.
[14:30:25] <walidvb> g'night
[14:35:30] <shoky> walidvb: you should set the transform-origin in a separate .css() call than the scale transform.
[14:35:44] <shoky> walidvb: also if you're using % then you need to multiply by 100
[14:36:03] <christophe`> Goodnight :)
[14:36:04] <walidvb> shoky: i'll try that. kzurawel technique doesn't do it either
[14:36:25] <shoky> walidvb: it'd be better to set the transform-origin when the user scrolls, not when changing the zoom
[14:36:29] <christophe`> Guys, I'm getting an error again .. activeVideo is undefined - can somebody please check what I'm doing wrong? http://vaneerdt.be/app/step1.php
[14:36:55] <shoky> walidvb: right now you're setting  like  0.05%
[14:36:59] <shoky> instead of 5%
[14:37:40] <walidvb> shoky: right. i am grateful for any other way of doing this, because this all seems clumsy so far
[14:39:52] <walidvb> i'm a bit lost as to how to achieve this
[14:40:26] <shoky> you're close
[14:41:06] <walidvb> shoky: which do you reckon was closest? my initial one or kzurawel one?
[14:44:15] <Krambiorix> hi, i keep getting 403 errors when trying to $.get('./program/steps/mail/export.php').....   Anyone?! I changed my fileperms already...
[14:45:28] <cwatson> I guess .load() isn't the best way to slide a whole page from left to right. Seems to slow down after while.
[14:47:34] <cwatson> Is there a 508-compliant IRC channel?
[14:47:35] <cwatson> lol
[14:51:44] <Krambiorix> does anyone pls want to help me...
[14:51:58] <Krambiorix>  i keep getting 403 errors when trying to $.get('./program/steps/mail/export.php').....
[14:52:22] <shoky> walidvb: i'd put position:relative on .main-container  and position:absolute; top: 0; left: 0;  on .main-zoom
[14:53:41] <walidvb> shoky: i need click&drag, too ;)
[14:53:48] <walidvb> but tell me more?
[14:54:53] <shoky> walidvb: if you do that then the origin is in the right place if you're on scale(1) , you can  scroll somewhere and then zooming out will work from the center of the viewport,
[14:55:37] <shoky> walidvb: but if you're already scaled  and then scroll,  chaning the zoom will make it jump. needs some more thinking about
[14:55:49] <walidvb> shoky: wow nice. still bugs, but at least it zooms straight out now
[15:00:59] <walidvb> well, set the value on scroll too, but that won't work, act. cause you can't change the origin while you scroll, otherwise it won't behave normally again..
[15:01:03] <Krambiorix> shoky any idea?
[15:02:12] <walidvb> Krambiorix: what happens if you visit that page?
[15:02:35] <Krambiorix> walidvb, the same error 403
[15:03:37] <walidvb> Krambiorix: this is prob not the right place to ask that, but you need to check server-side, whoever is serving you that page
[15:04:12] <Krambiorix> walidvb, i asked in httpd (apache) but they don't want to help me since the error is not in the error.log
[15:04:57] <walidvb> Krambiorix: hm, i doubt i can be of any help
[15:10:58] <vsync_> the alan watts riot, and the alan parsons project
[15:12:21] <christophe`> Wow I just noticed I can't mute HTML5 video when viewing on my mobile .. is this normal? Can I use js to stop this?
[15:12:44] <christophe`> it is set to be muted standard
[15:12:56] <relipse> i'm getting an Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation and I don't know why
[15:19:30] <walidvb> shoky: maybe using #container.scrollTop(y)? but what is y then?
[15:33:00] <christophe`> Can somebody tell me why in Firefox my audio elements are mostly hidden except for the first one http://vaneerdt.be/app/step2.php - it is also unplayable. And in Chrome they're visible but also unplayable?
[15:36:13] <christophe`> The files don't exist. Well that's obvious. Thank you, idiot me.
[15:39:50] <jshultz> hopefully someone here can help. i've got an issue where, once i click the back button, links on the page will stop working in jquery mobile.
[15:40:07] <jshultz> this mainly happens in iphone5
[15:40:25] <jshultz> i can click on the link, the top bar will drop, but the page won't go anywhere
[15:40:39] <jshultz> if i do a page refresh, then things start working again
[15:47:03] <serversides_> How would I add fadein(), fadeout() to every innerHTML and refresh it when the input is changed?  Here is the code http://pastebin.com/Xn0cDXJU
[15:48:11] <serversides_> the input values run through a function, so there are multiple outputs and change when any input value has changed.  Only thing is I cant fade it in and out as a transition :/
[15:49:06] <relipse> this line: var result = success.apply(frm, [ipt$.val(), {dlg:dlg$,frm:frm$,ipt:ipt$}]); is giving me Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation, what do I do?
[15:58:41] <shoky> relipse: what's success?
[16:01:08] <shoky> i'm guessing something native..
[16:02:36] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/f9gwN/ whats the correct way to do this because im clearly not doing it right
[16:06:13] <christophe`> Guys - any idea how I can quickly toggle the second-last button when clicked? I want it to be paused when it is playing. I have this: http://pastie.org/pastes/7986000/text
[16:06:25] <christophe`> can be seen here: http://vaneerdt.be/app/step1.php
[16:08:43] <shoky> unnu: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/f9gwN/2/
[16:09:56] <unnu> ty shoky
[16:11:56] <shoky> christophe`:  what second-last button? what does toggling it mean?
[16:12:27] <christophe`> Well I adapted it - It shows both a play icon and a pause icon. I just want a play icon when it is paused .. and a pause icon when it is playing.
[16:12:54] <shoky> $(this).text('►')
[16:13:00] <shoky> what's the problem?
[16:18:24] <christophe`> That was the problem.
[16:18:46] <christophe`> I thought I couldn't put it in my if - else because I thought it was targetting my video
[16:18:48] <christophe`> not my button
[16:19:26] <shoky> if/else don't target any elements
[16:19:48] <shoky> they wish they could
[16:50:07] <jacoluta> http://pastebin.com/gtenvt8X -- can some tell me why that only works once? After I click and the ajax call completes the on click event wont fire again
[16:51:33] <feathersanddown> Hi, I need to override jquery ui accordion css styles, someone know how or have something were to start
[16:54:41] <motaka2> I like to die
[17:05:45] <Squarism> There is so much maintainable .js in this world. No rotten code at all.
[18:25:25] <gaa> http://fuelyourcoding.com/scripts/infield/ how do i apply this only to selected fields?
[18:30:50] <gaa> anyone?
[18:32:14] <kkid> ls
[18:32:17] <kkid> cd ..
[18:32:21] <kkid> Hello
[18:34:47] <gaa> how can i apply jquery form effects to selected form fields?
[18:42:39] <brendal> gaa: Do you mean when the user selects them?
[18:43:16] <gaa> no i want some fields to be normal
[18:43:26] <gaa> and just some field to have the infield property
[18:44:16] <brendal> give the form elements you want to change a class
[18:47:11] <brendal> or an id since all the infields will probably be different
[18:48:11] <gaa> and how do i apply it to only that id or class?
[18:48:23] <not_mike> what does jsfiddle use to store its fiddles?
[18:48:26] <not_mike> sql?
[18:49:12] <brendal> a # at the front like in css. $('#my-elements-id')
[18:49:27] <brendal> for ids
[18:49:51] <brendal> for classes use a point. $('.my-class')
[18:50:10] <gaa> brendal: thanks, will try
[18:55:11] <brendal> not_mike: there must be a database but the content of the fiddle is probably in files
[18:56:04] <not_mike> when is it ever optimal to store information in json arrays instead of sql tables?
[18:56:45] <systemfault> sql table == storage, json = serialization format..
[18:56:57] <systemfault> You're comparing apples to oranges.
[18:59:25] <dylan9o4> hey guys
[18:59:49] <dylan9o4> anybody on?
[18:59:53] <brendal> ahoy
[18:59:53] <screamingbanshee> nope
[18:59:58] <dylan9o4> k lol
[19:00:23] <dylan9o4> just curious why this simple script doesn't work... http://jsbin.com/avegat/1/edit
[19:00:33] <robert_> has anybody ever come across a "relationship editor" akin to the one in MS Access?  (http://www.viksoe.dk/code/screenshots/relationship.gif)
[19:00:43] <robert_> in jQuery, I mean
[19:04:34] <brendal> dylan9o4: it works in the live preview
[19:18:06] <robert_> nobody?
[19:18:24] <ipc9> yah
[19:18:56] <christophe`> Hey guys, so I made this thing for school .. with a lot of help from this chat & stackoverflow. I was wondering if anybody had any remarks: http://vaneerdt.be/app/
[19:19:58] <ipc9> that url screams "insert credit card number to continue"
[19:20:31] <robert_> ipc9: me or..? lol
[19:21:04] <systemfault> It really looks like a school project to me..
[19:21:21] <robert_> that looks kinda neat, actually
[19:21:26] <innociv> Nothing even happens for me.
[19:21:37] <ipc9> how did you get the pic of the phone
[19:21:57] <ipc9> and how is the phone background the same as the webpage background
[19:22:17] <innociv> I guess I have to click "make your own"
[19:33:42] <christophe`> Woops - sorry was busy.
[19:34:51] <ipc9> you have a lot of css going on there
[19:35:29] <christophe`> Yeah - I planned on making it responsive .. but ended up having something responsive-ish without all the code for responsiveness.
[19:35:39] <christophe`> Well - for specific screen sizes
[19:36:02] <christophe`> The pic of the phone was a freebie I set the same background color in photoshop..- the goal is to show how music changes expectations and meanings of movie scenes..
[19:36:42] <christophe`> I'll take that css out - I forgot about it, thanks for reminding me ;p
[19:37:42] <gtsby> hi guys
[19:39:59] <christophe`> hi
[19:40:49] <DrPoole> g'day
[19:40:52] <DrPoole> http://pastebin.com/ShDwVTSZ
[19:41:01] <DrPoole> having an issue with this array.  im building it out from a previous json array
[19:41:13] <DrPoole> and my problem seems to be that each(foo,function(foobar,bar)
[19:41:24] <DrPoole> foobar (key) seems to increment from 0 rather than read the key of my array
[19:42:35] <DrPoole> cant seem to get passed this.
[19:44:54] <ipc9> wat
[19:45:51] <DrPoole> do you want me to type that again?
[19:45:52] <DrPoole> :)
[19:46:08] <ipc9> are you having a string/number conversion problem?
[19:46:39] <DrPoole> i guess my question is ... will each() always start the (int) key at 0?
[19:47:13] <DrPoole> line 18, i expected that to print 4436
[19:47:16] <DrPoole> the first key in my array
[19:47:20] <DrPoole> (on line 7)
[19:47:43] <DrPoole> ugh ... relipse
[19:47:49] <ipc9> you mean line 2
[19:47:50] <relipse>  javascript and jquery ninjas please help, this line is giving me an awkward Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation, any ideas: var result = typeof(success) == 'function' ? success.apply(frm, [ipt$.val(), {dlg:dlg$,frm:frm$,ipt:ipt$}]) : undefined;
[19:48:08] <relipse> didnt know you hang out in jquery as well
[19:48:11] <DrPoole> === 'function'
[19:48:14] <DrPoole> and shut up
[19:48:36] <relipse> i'm sorry you don't respect God nor his creation
[19:48:44] * DrPoole shakes his head
[19:48:48] <relipse> hope you repent before you burn in hell forever though :)
[19:48:55] <relipse> it would be nice to have a respectful conversation with you in heaven
[19:49:17] <DrPoole> absolutely.  quick question tho ... if i get a sloppy blowjob from a woman who isn't my wife ... is that a sin?
[19:49:21] <ipc9> DrPoole, you cant define array indexing, what you are actually creating is an object with a method called '4513' '3547', etc...
[19:49:27] <shoky> relipse: i asked you alrady, what's success?  something native?
[19:49:33] <relipse> success is a function
[19:49:36] <relipse> one sec let me show you
[19:49:37] <shoky> what function
[19:49:38] <DrPoole> hmm
[19:49:42] <shoky> your own?
[19:49:51] <relipse> https://github.com/relipse/jquery-dialogPrompt/blob/master/jquery.dialogPrompt.js#66
[19:49:57] <relipse> its one that was passed in
[19:50:15] <relipse> line 66
[19:50:43] <shoky> relipse: and what are you passing in?
[19:50:49] <DrPoole> i cant define indexes.  hmmm
[19:50:50] <silent_10010> HI, I'm using jquery ui autocomplete, a problem is when I paste some string to the 'input', it is not stable to trigger autocomplete
[19:51:05] <ipc9> DrPoole, nope
[19:51:19] <relipse> shoky it is a function, thats why i added the typeof(success) == 'function' check
[19:51:20] <ipc9> DrPoole, you can define object methods though
[19:51:21] <silent_10010> sometimes works. sometimes not
[19:51:24] <bobbobbins> hey, i'm using jquery mobile, and I'm checking it out on my phone, and everything looks really tiny, like its not sizing properly for it…any idea what causes this?
[19:51:30] <DrPoole> how can i process a json array and group some items
[19:51:41] <shoky> relipse: WHICH fuinction? your code doesn't show what you're passing in as 'success' argument
[19:51:44] <ipc9> DrPoole, depends on the data
[19:51:45] <DrPoole> in this case im getting all the penalties in a game and i want to group them by period_id
[19:52:09] <relipse>         addeditNote(obj, function(){
[19:52:09] <relipse>                   dpo.dlg.dialog('close');
[19:52:09] <relipse>                });
[19:52:20] <DrPoole> well, more accurate im grouping them by period_id and then time of penalty
[19:52:57] <shoky> relipse: that's not jQuery.dialogPrompt()  why is it so hard to answer the actual question i'm asking
[19:53:25] <relipse> sorry i meant this: https://pastee.org/g4pbh
[19:53:44] <DrPoole> http://pastebin.com/7CtkrdAD
[19:53:48] <ipc9> { period_id : null, timestamp: null }
[19:53:50] <DrPoole> this has become a bit....bad
[19:53:52] <DrPoole> in my testing
[19:55:58] <DrPoole> meh.  this all needs to be junked.  shame.
[19:57:16] <ipc9> where is jj defined?
[19:57:40] <ipc9> and wtf are you doing indexing arrays with double letters
[19:57:50] <DrPoole> starts as 0
[19:57:55] <ipc9> give it a meaningful name
[19:57:57] <DrPoole> above my paste
[19:58:29] <DrPoole> if i make the key a string
[19:58:41] <DrPoole> pah
[19:58:54] <DrPoole> i reckon my head is up my ass on this.  i need to re-think this.  wont waste your time.  cheers mate.
[19:59:23] <DrPoole> also, enjoy this guy relipse.  he's perhaps one of the most hated people on IRC.  he's banned from more channels than anybody ive ever met.  hah.
[19:59:35] <ipc9> seems like you have a lot going on in your object, try to refactor it
[20:00:04] <ipc9> haha
[20:00:15] <ipc9> nice, ill keep an eye
[20:00:17] <DrPoole> you may think he's a troll
[20:00:21] <DrPoole> but he's legit
[20:00:28] <DrPoole> (in that an absolute piece of garbage)
[20:01:02] <shoky> relipse:  what does console.log(success)  give you before that line?
[20:01:28] <shoky> relipse: got a live link? i don't see anything obvious
[20:02:51] <relipse> shoky
[20:02:54] <relipse> yeah
[20:03:31] <relipse> http://jim.clearbugs.com/members/ login: test_test_test username: admin password: testtest "View" any bug and then click + Note in the popup dialog
[20:04:19] <relipse> shoky the funny thing is it works using +Note on the list page, just not on the pop up dialog
[20:05:26] <shoky> relipse: i didn't get any error
[20:05:35] <shoky> oh i did when i clicked Ok
[20:05:40] <relipse> right yeah click ok
[20:06:07] <shoky> relipse but the error is coming from INSIDE the success function
[20:06:15] <shoky> the .apply worked fine
[20:06:24] <relipse> oh
[20:06:37] <relipse> can you point me to where inside the success  function it is coming
[20:07:20] <shoky> from inside addeditNote actually
[20:08:04] <shoky> something with the $.post call
[20:08:19] <relipse> inside the response or no?
[20:08:25] <shoky> no
[20:08:36] <shoky> the $.post call itself. trying to figure out what exactly
[20:09:10] <relipse> well the exact same $.post call works when using the +Note on the main page
[20:09:14] <relipse> (Not in the dialog)
[20:09:39] <relipse> try it if you will
[20:11:45] <shoky> relipse: you're sending an event object as data..
[20:11:53] <shoky> obj.bug_id is an event object
[20:12:04] <relipse> it is?
[20:12:07] <shoky> yerp
[20:12:14] <relipse> that little bugger
[20:12:18] <relipse> i'm filing a bug report for this
[20:12:23] <shoky> ;]
[20:12:25] <relipse> lol
[20:13:13] <relipse>                var obj = $(this).serializeForm();               obj.bug_id = bug_id;               obj.note = value;
[20:13:19] <relipse> thats where I get the bug_id
[20:13:28] <DaReaper5> can anyone here help me with a jqm input ordering issue
[20:13:35] <DaReaper5> i want to have a label after a checkbox. But I would like the label to nicely append to it (like other checkboxes would in a controlgroup)
[20:13:43] <DaReaper5> i know how to do this in bootstrap but can this be done in jqm?
[20:14:07] <relipse> oh ok:  $('#btnPopupAddNote').click(dlgAddNote);
[20:14:09] <shoky> relipse:  in dlgAddNote  the first argument is the event object, you called it bug_id
[20:14:23] <relipse> i meant to just call it with "undefined"
[20:14:40] <relipse> i suppose I can do !== 'string' or !== 'integer'
[20:14:48] <shoky> huh
[20:14:57] <angelazou> hi, I'm having a problem with a script, where I get Unexpected token < on jquery.js
[20:14:57] <shoky> just call it "event"
[20:15:11] <relipse> its not an event, in another case it is a bug_id
[20:15:19] <shoky> then that's wrong
[20:15:26] <shoky> dlgAddNote is an event handler
[20:15:27] <relipse>  $('#btnPopupAddNote').click(dlgAddNote); <-- thats whats wrong
[20:15:33] <relipse> no its a normal function
[20:15:35] <shoky> gotcha
[20:15:35] <angelazou> I'm not sure what to do
[20:15:37] <relipse> used as an event handler
[20:15:49] <relipse> i will just check if it is a string or 'integer' ??
[20:15:51] <DaReaper5> is this the proper irc for jquery mobile?
[20:16:12] <shoky> relipse:  .click(function() { dlgAddNote() })
[20:16:32] <relipse> oh nice
[20:16:34] <relipse> ty
[20:16:39] <shoky> yw
[20:17:17] <relipse> appreciate that
[20:18:35] <DaReaper5> is this the proper irc for jquery mobile?
[20:18:52] <shoky> DaReaper5 yeah
[20:19:12] <DaReaper5> i want to have a label after a checkbox. But I would like the label to nicely append to it (like other checkboxes would in a controlgroup)
[20:19:18] <DaReaper5> is this possible?
[20:19:28] <DaReaper5> or do i need to hack it or have custom css
[20:19:36] <DaReaper5> i know in bootstrap this is very easy
[20:20:47] <DaReaper5> OR can i have a label that has a "for" to the checkbox but a click does not actually change the value (instead it does something else)
[20:22:35] <brendal> DaReaper5:  like what?
[20:23:18] <DaReaper5> like this: http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/angularjs/#/
[20:23:42] <DaReaper5> checkbox and label/input are separate but nicely format together
[20:24:01] <DaReaper5> (i dont have to have the exact same styling)
[20:25:18] <relipse> hey shokyk
[20:25:21] <relipse> are you still there?
[20:25:28] <shoky> yup
[20:26:07] <relipse> if you are still on http://jim.clearbugs.com/members/ and you go to "View" and then click "+Note" the new dialog does not show up
[20:26:29] <relipse> (sometimes it does, but the screen goes modal and everything
[20:26:41] <relipse> its there because if you press ESC it goes away
[20:27:22] <relipse> basically it appears BENEATH the other dialog
[20:27:38] <relipse> and you can't drag and move the OTHER dialog because it has a modal screen on top
[20:28:09] <brendal> DaReaper5: It's a label for
[20:28:29] <brendal> DaReaper5: with its margin-left set
[20:28:51] <DaReaper5> brendal: ? but if i use "for" then clicking it will change the value of the checkbox. I do not want that
[20:29:04] <relipse> i guess maybe my question is, how can i ensure that my $.dialogPrompt() always shows ON TOP of everything and in the center of the viewport?
[20:33:43] <brendal> DaReaper5: It's not css alone. It's the javascript framework
[20:35:22] <shoky> relipse: obviously if you just change the position from absolute to fixed  when the page is scrolled, it won't appear in the middle anymore
[20:35:42] <DaReaper5> brendal: that is what i am afraid of
[20:36:23] <DaReaper5> brendal: is it so restrictive that I have no choice to use it like the demos... or is there form flexability
[20:36:53] <brendal> DaReaper5: You could just remove the for attribute
[20:38:31] <DaReaper5> brendal: yes but then how do i get the styling?
[20:40:17] <shoky> relipse:  set autoOpen: false,  then call .dialog('open')  AFTER setting the 'fixed' css
[20:40:33] <brendal> DaReaper5: Use your browsers dev  tools. If you use firefox: right click, inspect element
[20:40:58] <DaReaper5> brendal: so you are saying that i just copy and steal the css class used by jqm?
[20:41:53] <brendal> DaReaper5: no, just the ones you need.
[20:42:00] <relipse> shoky: thanks i'm trying it now
[20:42:49] <DaReaper5> brendal: ok, this feels like a hack but ok
[20:43:55] <brendal> DaReaper5: that will only provide the style though. It won't function the same without the framework.
[20:44:14] <shoky> relipse:  or just put position:fixed  on the class you put as dialogClass, i think that should do it too
[20:44:31] <relipse> shoky: well fixed is a property
[20:44:39] <relipse> user can pass in fixed:false
[20:44:50] <shoky> relipse:  so you can put a different class
[20:45:20] <relipse> actually i dont really want to make the user download a css class with my plugin
[20:46:14] <relipse> anyway, refresh the page, i think that fixed it
[20:46:30] <relipse> you have excellent work, it is refreshing to hear from someone with jquery and jqueryui expertise
[20:46:48] <shoky> :)
[20:58:36] <xertion> I'm creating a drag-and-drop designer tool where you can create designs in HTML and then store that design's HTML in the database.
[20:58:55] <xertion> When I load the HTML from the database to the tool again, I need to set .draggable(), .resizable() and so on on each element again.
[20:59:19] <xertion> When using .resizable it always adds that wrapping <div> on img's. But since It's already stored the HTML, all img already have that wrapping div.
[20:59:29] <xertion> so how do I make them resizable again without adding the wrapper twice?
[21:01:01] <Cork> xertion: you would have to clean up the html before storing it
[21:01:17] <Cork> as far as i know thats the only way
[21:02:18] <Cork> xertion: you could try running the destroy method on the images
[21:02:24] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/#method-destroy
[21:02:53] <Cork> i don't remember if the element keeps it's new dimension when that is called though
[21:02:58] <xertion> I'll check it out, but it looks like that will put the img back to it's normal size.
[21:03:04] <xertion> which will ruin the "design" that the user created.
[21:03:06] <Cork> it might ya
[21:03:22] <xertion> but maybe I can strip away the div like you say, then store it, then add div again.
[21:03:24] <Cork> if that doesn't work you would have to do it manually
[21:03:49] <Cork> uh, the point was to remove the div
[21:03:58] <Cork> if you add it again there would be no point
[21:04:21] <xertion> I mean, since it's dynamically loaded from a Database.
[21:04:26] <xertion> the element is no longer resizable
[21:04:39] <xertion> so I need to add .resizable() to all img elements that is loaded with ajax from the database.
[21:04:59] <xertion> and then it adds that div again.
[21:05:38] <xertion> So I'm saying I should then 1) Strip away ui-wrapper, 2) Store in database 3) When loaded, add .resizable() (and then automatically .resizable() adds ui-wrapper again)
[21:06:11] <Cork> yes
[21:08:48] <xertion> Cork: I just called .unwrap() before .resizable();
[21:08:50] <xertion> works fine.
[21:46:02] <bobbobbins> is there a way i can add an anchor tag to an image without jquery mobile adding its own classes to it? I tried data-role="none" but it still adds one
[21:47:04] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/QNumz/ whats wrong with the second function? i want it to turn it back into a <span>
[21:50:24] <delboy1978uk_> I'm trying to hide some buttons in a table, how do i grab all rows AFTER the one with the button I've just clicked?
[21:51:43] <delboy1978uk_> unnu no not mysql an html table :-P
[21:52:24] <Cork> unnu: when you replace the .title element, you don't give the new element the same class
[21:52:33] <unnu> aight
[21:52:58] <Eviltwin> delboy1978uk_: http://jsfiddle.net/NNDFN/
[21:53:14] <unnu> Cork, how am i supposed to do it then?
[21:53:23] <unnu> i want it so that if they cancel the edit it goes back to normal
[21:53:30] <unnu> and they can still hit edit
[21:53:32] <Cork> unnu: just give the new input element the same .title class
[21:53:37] <delboy1978uk_> nextAll()? Thats freaking awesome!
[21:53:48] <delboy1978uk_> i take it theres a prevail too?
[21:53:56] <Eviltwin> Not a prevail but a prevAll
[21:54:07] <delboy1978uk_> prevAll ()spellchecker :s
[21:54:13] <Eviltwin> I figured
[21:54:44] <delboy1978uk_> lol i hate spellchecker its always making mistakes with my perfect command of english
[21:55:02] <delboy1978uk_> this is what I'm trying to make: http://jsfiddle.net/aD7tA/
[21:56:06] <delboy1978uk_> if you try to book an appointment for say 3pm, i want the red buttons to stop once it hits another appointment
[21:56:35] <unnu> cork, its clearing all the data instead of replacing it
[21:58:05] <Cork> unnu: something like http://jsfiddle.net/QNumz/3/
[21:59:31] <meowcat> is there anything you can you do differntly with websockets that you cant do with AJAX? or are they really both offer the same functionality?
[21:59:57] <Cork> meowcat: you can push data to the client
[22:00:20] <Cork> so ya, websocket is a totally different beast then ajax
[22:00:57] <meowcat> so with ajax you need to keep polling to see if data is available whereas websockets has a listening function
[22:01:04] <Cork> server sent events is basically a native longpull solution though
[22:01:36] <Cork> meowcat: not really listening, your creating a mutexed connection
[22:01:45] <Cork> so you can send in both direction over it
[22:02:17] <Cork> and the connection stays active until you get networks error or explicitly close it
[22:02:22] <Eviltwin> delboy1978uk_: Something like this might work: http://jsfiddle.net/teTGK/
[22:02:55] <FuelNewb> Hello, Would anyone be able to point me towards a tutorial for the following situation: I would like to disable several checkbox's until a text-field has a valid e-mail inside it. then the checkboxes should be usable
[22:03:05] <meowcat> so ajax closes after the data has been recieved, but sockets stay open until closed
[22:03:17] <Cork> meowcat: so basically you can stream data over websocket without having to close the connection all the time
[22:03:38] <Cork> meowcat: no ajax gets the data when the connection has been closed
[22:04:08] <Cork> client connects to server > server process request > server sends data > browser gets data > server closes connection > javascript gets data
[22:04:25] <unnu> Cork, still removing instead of replacing http://jsfiddle.net/QNumz/4/,
[22:04:37] <delboy1978uk_> I'm playing with it :-P
[22:05:06] <meowcat> Cork: okay thanks, ill mess around with it :] pretty cool
[22:05:39] <Cork> meowcat: basically websocket is what it sounds like, its a web implementation of the normal socket solution
[22:05:49] <Cork> so, ya it is really cool
[22:06:14] <Eviltwin> FuelNewb: http://jsfiddle.net/9MRmb/
[22:06:29] <meowcat> im looking into that and node.js but i dont really see a use for node.js that i can think of right off the bat.
[22:06:56] <Eviltwin> Something that provides a WebSockets endpoint?
[22:06:59] <Cork> ya, i would go with python or go for websocekt
[22:07:20] <Cork> (personally i prefer go there)
[22:07:33] <FuelNewb> Eviltwin: wow thanks!  that's exactly what I need!
[22:08:22] <Cork> unnu: lol missed that you used val on span and text on input :) http://jsfiddle.net/QNumz/5/
[22:09:09] <unnu> ahhh
[22:09:13] <unnu> your the man cork
[22:09:15] <unnu> ;)
[22:10:00] <unnu> why did you use .each btw?
[22:10:02] <meowcat> are facebook messages done in ajax? or websocks?
[22:10:21] <Cork> unnu: just to create a scope for $(this)
[22:10:45] <Cork> meowcat: just based on how supported websocket is; i would say not websocket
[22:11:07] <Cork> and as i'm not using facebook, i can't really dig into what it uses :)
[22:11:16] <unnu> gotcha, is it hard to get each of those to talk to each other? i just realized that code takes what you type in and put it in there, i want it to go back to the original data.
[22:11:24] <unnu> or should i just reload it
[22:11:43] <Cork> unnu: not really
[22:12:02] <Cork> you could save the find data in a variable and use that instead of $(this)
[22:13:04] <unnu> arlight, ill try to figure that out
[22:16:31] <Eviltwin> meowcat: It's done with AJAX
[22:16:59] <unnu> i <3s me some ajax
[22:24:12] <delboy1978uk_> lookin good guys, thanks for pointing me in the right direction. nextAll rocks! http://jsfiddle.net/aD7tA/3/
[22:28:19] <lenswipee> hi, how to check if var $foo = 'some text'; $.trim($foo); is empty?
[22:28:43] <Cork> if($.trim($foo) == '')
[22:28:57] <FuelNewb> Eviltwin : if your still around would you be able to give me a similar example to the last ( http://jsfiddle.net/9MRmb/ ) but having one checkbox disabled until a second is checked... ?
[22:29:57] <lenswipee> Cork: == or ===
[22:30:05] <Cork> your choice
[22:30:27] <lenswipee> Cork: for a string you should use === correct?
[22:30:28] <Cork> meaning both works
[22:30:43] <Cork> not really a must no
[22:30:59] <Cork> === just means it does type checking
[22:32:03] <not_mike> I was confused for about 2 minutes
[22:32:15] <not_mike> Thought I was in ##php
[22:32:37] <not_mike> (was wondering why there was a period at the beginning of trim($foo)
[22:32:46] <FuelNewb> or anyone else to my question above :)
[22:33:47] <lenswipee> Cork: but for string 'foo' will evaluate to true on ==
[22:33:55] <shoky> FuelNewb: what've you tried so far that isn't working?
[22:34:15] <Cork> lenswipee: but trim will always return a string, so what is the problem?
[22:34:33] <lenswipee> Cork: i don't know anymore.
[22:34:34] <FuelNewb> shoky: No that example works fine. Now my question I would like Checkbox2 to be disabled until checkbox 1 is selected, how would I go abouts doing this
[22:34:59] <shoky> FuelNewb: i understood your question, and i asked you one in return
[22:37:00] <FuelNewb> shoky: sorry, I have this : http://jsfiddle.net/xCvMP/ : is there a more efficent way to do this though?
[22:37:54] <shoky> FuelNewb: that looks fine
[22:39:32] <shoky> FuelNewb: umm except for mixing 'checked' with 'disabled'
[22:40:24] <FuelNewb> hrmm it still doesn't seem to be working
[22:42:14] <FuelNewb> http://jsfiddle.net/xCvMP/6/
[22:43:02] <shoky> FuelNewb: you're confusing 'checked' with 'disabled'
[22:43:16] <FuelNewb> I've replaced that
[22:43:51] <shoky> FuelNewb: they're both not disabled on page load.. doing .prop('disabled', false)  will do nothing
[22:44:03] <shoky> just.. think :\
[22:44:08] <Cork> FuelNewb: http://jsfiddle.net/xCvMP/8/
[22:44:30] <Cork> i guess that is what you where trying to do
[22:44:46] <FuelNewb> Cork: what I am trying to-do is have box2 disabled until box1 is checked :)
[22:45:07] <FuelNewb> then reversely if box1 becomes unchecked it would disable box2
[22:45:16] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/xCvMP/10/
[22:46:00] <FuelNewb> Cork: exactly, except that in that one if I uncheck box1, box2 stays enabled
[22:46:03] <shoky> what's the next task you want someone to do for you
[22:46:14] <Cork> FuelNewb: so add the else case in the click
[22:46:21] <shoky> meh sorry disregard me.
[22:46:33] <Cork> or even simpler
[22:46:43] <FuelNewb> shoky: I asked earlier if someone could point me to a suitable tutorial
[22:46:45] <Cork> pass the prop('checked') value to the diable call
[22:47:13] <shoky> FuelNewb: alright, sorry for nagging
[22:47:17] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/xCvMP/11/
[22:47:17] <Cork> FuelNewb: this isn't really something you will find a tutorial for
[22:48:03] <Cork> or simply http://jsfiddle.net/xCvMP/12/
[22:48:06] <FuelNewb> Cork: is there some type of tutorial not speicifically for this but this type of logic / enabling, disabling other elements?

[22:59:11] <bot-t> Cork: "mm"
[23:00:43] <unnu> split is like php explode

[23:00:46] <unnu> :D
[23:01:07] <Cork> Abhijit: is date a javascript date object?
[23:01:20] <Abhijit> Cork, no. its json. then strigify

[23:04:54] <FilipNortic> cork: okey so no magic there... thanks anyway
[23:05:44] <ryorky1> hey guys, I know that /^[^\.]*$/ regex will find a period in a string, how can I check to see if just the first character before other characters is not a period.  I also need to allow leading whitespaces
[23:06:03] <ryorky1> or rather leading spaces
[23:06:27] <Cork> ryorky1: uh... no
[23:06:41] <ryorky1> Cork:  ???
[23:06:51] <Cork> that selects the content of the string if it doesn't have a period
[23:07:20] <Cork> /\./g would select the periods in the string
[23:07:42] <Cork> and /^\./ checks if the first character is a period
[23:08:55] <Cork> or if you want the inverted format that you had before /^[^.].*$/
[23:10:44] <Abhijit> i get error if i do this var mo = this.date; var mostr = mo.split('/')[1]);
[23:10:53] <Abhijit> Cork, ^
[23:11:02] <Eviltwin> You should probably match your parantheses
[23:11:05] <Cork> you have an extra ) there
[23:12:19] <unnu> lol cork, i can't spell category
[23:13:44] <Abhijit> ok
[23:14:33] <Abhijit> if i have 01 in my file.json and then i stringifi it in jquery and then i compare it then will 01==1 or not?
[23:14:54] <Abhijit> or i must compare with the exach data that in json file
[23:14:58] <Abhijit> that is 01
[23:15:03] <Cork> ?eval "01" == 1
[23:15:03] <bot-t> Cork: true
[23:15:06] <Cork> ?eval "01" === 1
[23:15:06] <bot-t> Cork: false
[23:15:11] <Cork> so it depends on how you check

[23:29:03] <unnu> was*
[23:29:32] <Cork> darmer??
[23:29:39] <farmer-duck> I'm having some issues with a script of mine... I'm trying to perform a full refresh with jQuery. Currently I use window.location.href to do so, but I think there should be a better alternative
[23:30:00] <Cork> farmer-duck: window.location.reload() ?
[23:30:30] <farmer-duck> that's the refresh indd...
[23:30:31] <unnu> location.reload();
[23:30:38] <unnu> shit, beat me to it
[23:32:32] <farmer-duck> but, jQuery offers a nice solution for a AJAX, but isn't there a way to it for a normal request...
[23:32:36] <farmer-duck> ?
[23:32:49] <Cork> why?
[23:33:03] <Cork> it can't make it much shorter then window.location.reload()
[23:33:30] <farmer-duck> yeah, that's the reload, but i also perform redirects,
[23:35:13] <Cork> not really redirects, but url changes and ya that is window.location = 'new url';
[23:36:27] <Abhijit> i can do var a,b,c=2; and var d,e,f=''; if jq right?
[23:36:46] <Cork> in jqeury no, in javascript yes
[23:37:03] <Cork> jquery isn't a language
[23:37:04] <Abhijit> then what the equivalent in jq?
[23:37:14] <Cork> there isn't one; jquery isn't a language
[23:37:32] <Cork> you write javascript, and jquery gives you helper functions
[23:37:32] <Abhijit> i am doing that inside jQuery(function($) and getting error
[23:37:57] <Cork> whats the error?
[23:38:39] <Abhijit> those are the conters. and the error is jq cannot assign value to them. the say undefined.
[23:38:44] <Abhijit> counter
[23:38:54] <Cork> ?p

[23:47:28] <Abhijit> thanks Cork for your time. i made it var a=1.b=1 and so on on one line
[23:50:52] <Abhijit> is there any way i can detect overlapping of two div?
[23:51:24] <Cork> you would have to calculate the offsets and height/width of the two elements
[23:51:33] <Cork> and then see if they are in each other ranges
[23:51:41] <Abhijit> ok
[23:53:10] <diverdude> Hello. How do i make a function globally available between different document ready methods? http://jsfiddle.net/VYDpK/
[23:54:22] <Cork> diverdude: declare it outside the ready callback
