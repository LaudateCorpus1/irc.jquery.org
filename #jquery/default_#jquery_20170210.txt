[02:41:24] <skywater> hi, sometimes users can only see change when they press ctrl+f5 is there an alternative way to see the change without pressing ctrl+f5
[03:30:41] <Cork> skywater: see what change?
[03:56:22] <jerit> So I have window.onload running a function that adjusts my site header when you scroll, but at the same time, I need to load meta tags into my <head>
[03:57:04] <jerit> DOH! I think I've just fixed my problem without jquery
[03:59:13] <Cork> jerit: just so you know, setting meta tags after page load have no effect
[04:00:26] <jerit> Cork that's the beauty of my alternate solution assuming it works as intended
[04:00:38] <Cork> ya, it prob does
[04:00:49] <Cork> cause you shouldn't need to do what you asked for
[04:01:17] <jerit> I'll load the meta data into the ASP.NET MVC ViewBag and then just add the meta tags in as <meta name="keywords" content="@ViewBag.Keywords" />
[04:01:28] <jerit> since ViewBag gets processed server side it should work perfectly
[04:02:04] <Cork> as long as it gets processed before the page is first rendered
[05:01:55] <jak2000> hi all
[05:02:17] <jak2000> parseFloat(wvar)      wich return if: wvar=""  ?
[05:03:06] <Cork> what's the question?
[05:04:20] <jak2000> if wvar=""  wich value return:  parseFloat(wvar) ?   0?
[05:10:41] <jak2000> solved :)
[05:10:42] <jak2000> || 0
[05:21:38] <Cork> jak2000: if you ask what parseFloat returns if the value isn't parsable it is NaN
[05:21:50] <Cork> it's stated here https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat
[05:22:06] <Cork> next time you might actually want to ask a question if you want an answer
[05:22:25] <Cork> (i'm still not sure what you asked)
[05:23:10] <jak2000> Cork escuse me,
[05:23:41] <jak2000> i evaluate: if parseFloat(wvar)<0 {  }
[05:23:48] <jak2000> but yes i see it return a nan..
[05:23:56] <Cork> uh
[05:24:11] <jak2000> thanks
[05:24:15] <jak2000> where are you from?
[05:24:19] <jak2000> europe?
[06:35:01] <PhpNoob> hi, can i make it with multiple select?
[06:35:02] <PhpNoob> http://jsfiddle.net/PvJau/2/
[06:35:05] <PhpNoob> this is an example
[06:37:30] <Cork> PhpNoob: sure, just styp using ids for everything you want to do
[06:37:41] <Cork> and possibly use delegated event listeners
[06:37:50] <Cork> btw don't put tag names infront of id selectors
[06:37:52] <PhpNoob> i dont know how to can you show me?
[06:37:53] <Cork> it is just wasteful
[06:38:23] <Cork> as $('form#container') is the same as (in what the browser has to do) as $('form').filter('#container')
[06:38:38] <Cork> the id is globally unique in the page so just do $('#container')
[06:39:06] <PhpNoob> if i change to  $('#container')  is that work?
[06:39:33] <PhpNoob> can you show me in jsfiddle
[06:39:39] <PhpNoob> Please
[06:39:57] <Cork> no that was a generic information about tag-name#id
[06:40:16] <Cork> (and that it is a bad idea to write selectors like that)
[06:40:31] <PhpNoob> can you show me in jsfiddle?
[06:40:38] <Cork> ...
[06:40:49] <PhpNoob> please :(
[06:40:51] <Cork> i'm working on a solution for your question
[06:41:01] <Cork> the comment had nothing to do with that
[06:41:26] <PhpNoob> its work for one select its create input field but with multi select its not work
[06:41:36] <Cork> wait... you're generating a form just for the input fields?!?
[06:41:47] <PhpNoob> yes generating input field
[06:41:49] <PhpNoob> did you run ?
[06:41:55] <PhpNoob> select 1 2 3 4 5
[06:41:59] <Cork> PhpNoob: do you understand what i meant about the $('form#container')
[06:42:26] <PhpNoob> not really
[06:42:26] <Cork> why have separate froms for the input fields?
[06:42:43] <PhpNoob> is it wrong?
[06:42:44] <Cork> PhpNoob: ids in a browser is mapped to a hash table in the browser
[06:42:46] <Cork> yes
[06:42:58] <Cork> the hash table is very very fast to do lookups in
[06:43:21] <Cork> classes is collected in a similar hash table, but allows multiple entries and is just slightly slower
[06:43:34] <PhpNoob> so what need it?
[06:43:39] <Cork> so doing $('#container') is a straight memory lookup for the browser
[06:44:04] <Cork> when you do $('form#container' though you ask the browser to traverse the dom collect all forms
[06:44:19] <Cork> and then filter out the form matching the hash entry for #container
[06:44:30] <Cork> i hope that makes it clear it is a bad idea
[06:44:41] <PhpNoob> for multiselect?
[06:44:46] <Cork> for selectors
[06:44:51] <Cork> any selectors
[06:46:38] <PhpNoob> https://jsfiddle.net/t32qbzq6/ you mean like that?
[06:46:53] <Cork> the select at line 2 too
[06:46:54] <PhpNoob> but multiple not work
[06:47:12] <Cork> but again, note this is not a solution to your problem (i'm still working on that),
[06:47:23] <PhpNoob> i see
[06:48:22] <MilhoDroid> hi people
[06:49:17] <MilhoDroid> anyone here does work with cordova/phonegap using jquery?
[06:49:28] <PhpNoob> me
[06:49:36] <MilhoDroid> nice!
[06:50:13] <MilhoDroid> I wanna start developing with phonegap, but don't have any idea from what to start from...
[06:50:39] <MilhoDroid> Can you recomend me something to study? I am Android Java developer...
[06:51:16] <PhpNoob> dont start it
[06:51:27] <PhpNoob> phonegap is sux
[06:51:53] <PhpNoob> if you are android java developer why you need phonegap?
[06:51:56] <PhpNoob> its not native.
[06:52:06] <MilhoDroid> I do need to develop multiplatform apps...
[06:52:18] <PhpNoob> cross platform
[06:52:25] <MilhoDroid> Android, iOS and Web
[06:52:29] <PhpNoob> i see
[06:52:30] <MilhoDroid> yes
[06:52:44] <PhpNoob> there is some alternative for that
[06:52:58] <MilhoDroid> what are the best ones in your opinion?
[06:53:03] <MilhoDroid> not xamarin, pls...
[06:53:25] <PhpNoob> do you want free?
[06:53:48] <MilhoDroid> at first, yes. I am starting a company, so have no much money for now...
[06:54:11] <MilhoDroid> whops, need to leave some minutes... brb. sorry.
[06:54:34] <PhpNoob> i have found before alternative but dont remember now
[06:54:38] <Cork> PhpNoob: something like http://jsfiddle.net/PvJau/10/
[06:55:04] <PhpNoob> Cork but its not multiple
[06:55:13] <Cork> uh... yes it is
[06:55:34] <Cork> unless you mean something else
[06:55:35] <PhpNoob> <select id="formName1" name="blockUnits" class="formNames"> its not multiple
[06:55:48] <PhpNoob> select multiple i mean
[06:56:02] <Cork> how would that make sense for this code?
[06:56:10] <Cork> what would multiple even do here?
[06:56:46] <Cork> pick one of the selected rows at random and show that number of input fields?
[06:57:28] <PhpNoob> i dont need 3 select i need only 1 select with multiple
[06:57:44] <Cork> sure, but you have to explain what multiple is suppose to do
[06:58:26] <PhpNoob> for example select : 1 create  1 input after select 2 create input 2 and there is 3 input field. if i unselect 1 1 field must be remove there
[06:58:29] <PhpNoob> thats all
[06:58:46] <Cork> and when one selects 1,2,3 and 4?
[06:58:55] <Cork> (as you want multiple)
[06:58:59] <PhpNoob> value total is 10
[06:59:07] <PhpNoob> yes multiple
[06:59:11] <Cork> O_o'
[06:59:17] <Cork> so sum them up?!?
[06:59:26] <PhpNoob> like that
[06:59:31] <Cork> why the *** do you want a confusing structure like that?
[06:59:38] <PhpNoob> :(
[07:00:24] <PhpNoob> if select breed create input and write price. if select honey create input write price because of that
[07:00:50] <PhpNoob> i will put all value 1 and that create 1 value each of them
[07:00:54] <Cork> ok, so the number has nothing to do with the number of input fields to create?
[07:01:04] <Cork> you example was a bit misleading there
[07:01:19] <PhpNoob> sorry
[07:01:28] <PhpNoob> but you understand now i think?
[07:08:59] <Cork> PhpNoob: so something like http://jsfiddle.net/PvJau/11/ ?
[07:09:30] <PhpNoob> yess
[07:09:49] <PhpNoob> thank you
[07:10:10] <Uhkis> that oneliner :D
[07:10:59] <Uhkis> Cork: have you given up on readability?
[07:11:17] <Cork> Uhkis: i find those quite readable actually
[07:11:56] <Cork> i usually don't create the container in js so that part i usually don't have
[07:12:04] <Cork> and ya, that makes it a little messy
[07:12:12] <Uhkis> Cork: oh, jsfiddle just made it look like one line
[07:12:35] <Uhkis> could still use some line breaks imo
[07:19:09] <PhpNoob> Cork do you know sumoselect
[07:19:34] <PhpNoob> i'm tried it your function with this http://hemantnegi.github.io/jquery.sumoselect/sumoselect_demo.html
[07:19:48] <PhpNoob> but its not work
[07:20:29] <Cork> uh, ya as it most likely is replacing the the select element with javascript generated elements
[07:20:42] <Cork> and there through making it not a select element
[07:20:56] <Cork> (and there by making all that code moot)
[07:21:27] <PhpNoob> i dont know whats wrong
[07:22:10] <Cork> you've written code for a select element and then use a plugin that replaces the select element
[07:22:16] <Cork> so the code doesn't work
[07:23:01] <PhpNoob> how can i solve it
[07:23:11] <Cork> write a solution that works with the plugin
[07:23:27] <PhpNoob> me?
[07:23:33] <Cork> it won't have anything to do with the solution i wrote though
[07:23:51] <Cork> ya, as you didn't share that you didn't plan to use select elements
[07:23:57] <Cork> and i have wasted enough time to day
[07:24:23] <Justice> you can use if(!!val) to check if its empty undefined but is this described somewhere ?
[07:24:36] <Justice> "le docs"
[07:24:52] <Cork> you can't use that to detect undefined
[07:25:00] <Cork> it will throw an error if you do
[07:25:25] <Cork> and !! is just dubble reverting of a boolean value
[07:25:40] <Cork> the first one is type casing the value to an inverted boolean
[07:25:44] <Cork> and the second one is inverting it
[07:26:43] <Justice> Pretty sure it worked for me when the value got undefined without actually throwing an error.
[07:26:57] <Cork> Justice: https://jsfiddle.net/nyfnju5y/
[07:27:17] <Cork> "ReferenceError: doesntExist is not defined"
[07:27:42] <Cork> opps missed the !! for the second version
[07:27:50] <Cork> (doesn't matter though)
[07:28:14] <Cork> the point is, you can check if a property exists through this, but not if a variable exists
[07:28:33] <PhpNoob> what are you talking about?
[07:28:33] <Cork> cause missing variables throws exceptions if they don't exist
[07:29:45] <PhpNoob> its not work with sumoselect :(
[07:32:41] <Justice> Cork: but is there a propper way to check against undefined?
[07:33:17] <Cork> Justice: for properties that works just fine, but for variables you need to use typeof(variable) == "undefined"
[07:33:49] <Cork> cause typeof is the only method allowed to touch variables that doesn't exist (without throwing exceptions)
[07:34:20] <Cork> Justice: also var v = undefined; if(!!v) {} is still fine :)
[07:35:21] <Justice> yeah =)
[07:35:27] <PhpNoob> Cork my jquery ver. is 1.9.0 is that problem?
[07:35:33] <Cork> no
[07:35:34] <PhpNoob> because your ver. is 1.9.1
[07:35:42] <Cork> you need to use jquery > 1.7
[07:35:47] <MilhoDroid> I'm back.... sorry
[07:35:47] <Cork> but that's it
[07:36:05] <PhpNoob> but in jsfield its 1.9.1
[07:36:45] <PhpNoob> hmm doesnt matter
[07:42:55] <PhpNoob> yes its work
[07:43:00] <PhpNoob> i changed function type :)
[08:40:31] <robsco> i have a div with other divs inside it.  i want to put another element after those div's.  how come .append() isn't doing what I want?  how else can i insert an element just before the closing tag of an an element?
[08:41:07] <robsco> .prepend() is doing it great when the element is first opened
[08:43:56] <lowbro> robsco: what is .append() doing what you think it shouldn't?
[08:45:13] <robsco> i use prepend to inject in a form tag when the div opens.  there are then some other div's statically in the div.  i then want to append the losing form tag at the end of the div, but the </form> is appearing straight after the opening form tag
[08:46:16] <robsco> tho even using .before() and .after() is giving the same result, well, with the form tag before the div in question, but still with the closing form tag immediately after it  :-/
[08:46:47] <robsco> https://nopaste.xyz/?e2ed36fb2ec60f0e#lgSv3uAkE9A9AcfvoSld4zxNvOE8iCvcIXPS21geKSk=
[08:48:14] <robsco> results in <form action="/login.json" method="post" id="login-form"></form> just before <div class="modal-content">
[08:49:01] <dglambert> morning
[09:30:03] <cp> hey guys, can someone tell me
[09:31:17] <cp> when you are using bindEvents function in one of your js class which basically sets up events using jquery how do you get to your prototype class?
[09:32:05] <cp> 'this' is bringing back the event element
[09:32:46] <cp> when i want it to bring back the class
[09:46:54] <themediator> Can anyone tell me why my $('.newtool').mousemove(function()) isn't working in https://jsfiddle.net/kL2a0emd/1/ this code?
[10:13:09] <taplar> themediator: when is that binding ran?
[11:59:10] <themediator> https://jsfiddle.net/g784spv5/  Why does the red square continue to disappear whenever I drag and drop it into the grey square?
[12:05:01] <robertmaxrees> gotta add sepcial handling for that.
[12:05:37] <themediator> Can you be a bit more specific?
[12:05:57] <themediator> shouldn't the accept:".drop" make it to where it will stick in that div?
[12:06:06] <robertmaxrees> the clone breaks that iirc.
[12:06:54] <themediator> So how is it supposed to work?
[12:07:00] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/10711784/923919
[12:07:05] <robertmaxrees> something like this/
[12:09:20] <jj15> Hey guys, any fix for this issue? I’m getting the same https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3157 … I can’t install jQuery migrate 3 because I’m developing a WP plugin that already has it’s own migrate (1.4.1) built into the core.
[12:09:33] <dumbo> Cork: you freelancing that D3 stuff by any chance?
[12:10:21] <robertmaxrees> jj15 why not set a particular version of jquery as a dependency and drop migrate out of your plugin?
[12:11:15] <dumbo> robertmaxrees :)
[12:11:19] <dumbo> man i remember u!
[12:11:31] <dumbo> helped me write most of my code...
[12:11:34] <dumbo> god damn ;)
[12:12:18] <jj15> robertmaxrees I am already using the latest version of jQuery in the plugin. Installed via npm, I’m using browserify. Migrate is loaded automatically by Wordpress by default.
[12:12:28] <robertmaxrees> jj15 eep.
[12:12:40] <robertmaxrees> wordpress plugin development blows my mind.
[12:12:49] <jj15> Same. I dislike doing it.
[12:12:58] <robertmaxrees> do you need to expose any jquery methods?
[12:13:05] <robertmaxrees> or can you conflict it instead?
[12:13:33] <robertmaxrees> *nconflict
[12:34:32] <cannap> can any see whats wrong whit this $(`[data-target="${target}"]`).addClass('lol')
[12:35:18] <cannap> i try to select by data-target="some"
[12:35:55] <robertmaxrees> how are you setting data-target?
[12:36:02] <cannap> ah
[12:36:06] <cannap> i had a space in the data-target
[12:36:19] <robertmaxrees> are you using .data() ?
[12:36:40] <cannap> for getting yea but my problem was data-target="hello "
[12:36:44] <cannap> the space after o "
[12:36:55] <cannap> now it works
[12:36:56] <robertmaxrees> fwiw I'd use .filter() for that instead.
[12:37:09] <robertmaxrees> attribute selectors can be a little funky.
[12:43:38] <jj15> robertmaxrees: I found the issue. It’s because there’s 2 versions of jQuery. The WP version, and the newer version I need. No conflict isn’t working though. It’s a headache because I didn’t even write this mess of JS I have to work with.
[12:44:21] <robertmaxrees> right - the 2 versions are the root cause of the issue.  i'm just poking at ideas
[13:27:10] <phelix> I am trying to modify the html returned from using the jquery autocomplete library. From all the documents and info I can find this seems to be the correct way, however It doesn't seem to be doing anything. http://pastebin.com/S1s9D7j0
[13:50:05] <robsco> how can i remove the submit event from a form, I want to update it with a different action
[13:50:13] <robertmaxrees> prevent it instead.
[13:50:25] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault() });
[13:52:40] <robsco> i've already set a submit action that returns false, so that's preventing the default, but now i want to remove my own event handler, and set a diff one
[13:53:17] <robertmaxrees> why not have one handler that checks for some condition and do one thing or another.
[13:53:21] <phelix> Anyone familiar with trying to change html output returned from autocomplete?? I can't for the life of me figure out why this is not working.
[13:53:35] <robsco> i'm re-using the form for a few different scenarios
[13:53:47] <robertmaxrees> robsco i mean, you can use .off()
[13:53:59] <robertmaxrees> but i'd avoid juggling event bindings.
[13:54:14] <robsco> okay, i'll see if i can go with just one
[13:56:24] <phelix> I can't even get it to spit anythingo ut in console.log inside my _renderItem function.. like it doesn't even exist.
[13:59:25] <robertmaxrees> is it data("ui-autocomplete") or data("autocomplete") ?
[13:59:30] <robertmaxrees> phelix
[13:59:42] <phelix> i get an error when trying to use autocomplete
[13:59:48] <phelix> but no errors using ui-autocomplete
[13:59:52] <robertmaxrees> what version of jqui and jq?
[13:59:56] <robertmaxrees> and what error were you getting?
[14:01:30] <phelix> jq 1.8.3
[14:02:14] <phelix> jqui 1.10.2
[14:03:44] <robertmaxrees> 'cause everything i'm seeing says .data( "autocomplete" )._renderItem = function( ul, item ) {
[14:03:53] <robertmaxrees> but without seeing the error, i'm not sure what the issue is.
[14:04:30] <robertmaxrees> oh interesting.   it depends on the version you're using.
[14:04:35] <phelix> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property '_renderItem' of undefined
[14:04:40] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/16372823/923919
[14:04:42] <phelix> is what I receive if I use autocomplete
[14:04:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, sounds like that changed a while back.
[14:04:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[14:05:05] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/SirDerpington/bx8Ye/143/
[14:05:13] <robertmaxrees> this seems to show the basic idea.
[14:05:36] <phelix> Yea, it looks like I am doing it right. However, I don't get anything. No errors and doesn't even display any console.log inside that function
[14:05:47] <robertmaxrees> does autocomplete work ata ll?
[14:06:26] <phelix> Yea, the autocomplete function is working fine.. Let me try to modify it and set it inside the create method instead.
[14:09:55] <phelix> no errors but still nothing using the way it was done on that example page using the create: function ()
[14:10:11] <robertmaxrees> can you share a fiddle using static data?
[14:10:30] <phelix> hm, maybe let me try
[14:28:07] <phelix> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/6mctux76/1/
[14:28:19] <phelix> not sure im adding the files correctly. Never used jsfiddle before
[14:30:13] <robertmaxrees> isn't jquery ui autocomplete apart of jquery ui?
[14:30:34] <phelix> don't think so. I'm using that plugin
[14:31:04] <phelix> hmm, maybe I am not. But don't get automplete not found
[14:31:28] <phelix> think your right actually.. Don't think what i am doing even uses this plugin
[14:36:51] <phelix> looks like we need ui.autocomplete
[14:37:04] <phelix> jquery.autocomplete.js
[14:37:30] <robertmaxrees> is that different from jqui'
[14:37:36] <robertmaxrees> *jqui's autocomplete?
[14:37:58] <robertmaxrees> because it already has http://api.jqueryui.com/1.10/autocomplete/
[14:38:06] <phelix> Well if I add it I no longer get a error about not finding autocomplete
[14:38:16] <phelix> https://jsfiddle.net/6mctux76/5/
[14:38:17] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting that plugin from?
[14:38:51] <phelix> https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery.devbridge-autocomplete/1.2.2
[14:39:09] <robertmaxrees> that's not the same thing.
[14:39:21] <robertmaxrees> which autocomplete are yopu trying to use?
[14:39:51] <phelix> I thought it was what comes with jquery.
[14:40:02] <phelix> But I am not sure why thte jquery in jsfiddle doesn't seem to include it
[14:40:11] <robertmaxrees> err, jquery doesn't have anything like that.
[14:40:16] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui does
[14:40:41] <phelix> https://jsfiddle.net/6mctux76/6/ I have jquery ui on here but getting error about it not existing.
[14:41:10] <phelix> ohh there it goes
[14:41:11] <phelix> weird
[14:42:21] <phelix> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/6mctux76/7/
[14:42:24] <phelix> ok I have fiddle working now
[14:42:44] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:42:51] <robertmaxrees> you're including jquery and jquery ui twice now heh.
[14:44:27] <phelix> hmm no way to deselect a framework once you have picked one..
[14:44:39] <robertmaxrees> just delete the external resouces.
[14:45:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/6mctux76/11/
[14:45:18] <phelix> yes ok. There it goes.
[14:45:32] <phelix> now to figure out why _renderItem seems to do nothing
[14:48:23] <phelix> can't even get a console log out of the create: event
[14:48:27] <robertmaxrees> sec
[14:49:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/6mctux76/14/
[14:49:02] <robertmaxrees> works.
[14:49:51] <phelix> wtf... doesn't look like I was doing anything that differently. in my initial code. Let me try this
[14:51:01] <robertmaxrees> except for including things all funny.
[14:51:36] <phelix> Yea, hmm. Just adding the .data part after autocomplete locally does not work. Did you change anything else?
[14:52:18] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:52:25] <phelix> hmm. so weird.
[14:52:28] <robertmaxrees> i just copied that method. to the right place.
[14:53:06] <phelix> http://pastebin.com/S1s9D7j0 this was my original code.. Seems same as what you just did
[14:53:10] <phelix> must be something else weird going on
[14:53:41] <robertmaxrees> any network tab issues?
[14:53:48] <robertmaxrees> like cors or 404 or w/e
[14:54:18] <phelix> there are on trying to load some fonts and some images. But shouldn't effect the site.
[14:54:26] <phelix> the auto complete is working and populating
[14:59:19] <robertmaxrees> link to the page maybe?
[14:59:45] <phelix> I am wondering if its because I am using 1.8.3
[15:00:01] <robertmaxrees> jquery 1.8.3?
[15:00:11] <robertmaxrees> try bumping version and see if that helps.
[15:00:42] <phelix> I did, breaks other things.. hmm.
[15:56:54] <blindMoe> is it possible to query for an element that has only one child using a single selector?
[15:57:32] <blindMoe> hrmm I think I found my answer... :only-child
[16:50:37] <MikeD_> .on('change keyup', function ... )  <-- is it a space separated list or comma?
[16:51:16] <MikeD_> space, sorry
[16:54:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:04:34] <taplar> any dam updates?
[17:05:57] <robertmaxrees> sounds like the spillway it totally wrecked.  just going to erode some of the ground by it but water is still getting to where it needs to go.
[17:06:17] <robertmaxrees> gonna have to open the emergency spillway, too.
[17:06:36] <taplar> hmm
[17:06:37] <robertmaxrees> fun fact: that resevoir has the tallest dam in the US.
[17:07:05] <taplar> is it just a reservoir or does it have any generator facilities/
[17:09:37] <robertmaxrees> yep - hydroelectric plant there too iirc.
[17:12:53] <robertmaxrees> basically, the inflows to the lake were hitting over 118,000 cfs (cubic feet per second).  the plant can take 13,000, and they were releasing around 35,000 via the spillway.
[17:12:59] <robertmaxrees> huge amounts of water
[17:17:46] <Confoozed> Hi everyone.  Can I please ask a question of any dev's who are familiar with the DatePicker widget of jquery?
[17:18:27] <Uhkis> yes, you can.
[17:18:38] <Confoozed> I need to display a calendar on my site, and when someone clicks on a day, they get re-directed to a website with that date attached in a certain format.  Is that possible with jquery UI?
[17:19:09] <taplar> there should be a callback option that you can use on date selection
[17:19:10] <Confoozed> When I say attached, I mean sent in the URL
[17:20:34] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onSelect possibly
[17:20:36] <Confoozed> possibly onSelect, but I can't quite get my head around how to use it - I'm very new and trying to teach myself
[17:21:20] <taplar> datepicker({ onSelect: function(){ ...blah your stuff goes here... }});
[17:21:34] <taplar> add that key value pair when you instantiate the datepicker
[17:21:43] <taplar> err, initialize
[17:22:28] <taplar> any of those listings you see under the Options column function like that
[17:23:51] <Confoozed> Ah, I see...  ok.  And I also saw getdate() - do you know if that would be required as well?
[17:24:18] <Confoozed> (a method, not an option)
[17:24:23] <taplar> possibly not, onSelect says it passes in the date text as a parameter
[17:24:43] <taplar> so i guess it depends on what format that text is in and if that works for you or not
[17:25:27] <Confoozed> Of course, so then I just need to format the date into day=??&month=??&year=???? somehow
[17:25:48] <Confoozed> Thanks taplar - that's given me something to have a play with at least
[17:26:02] <taplar> if that's the case it might be easiest to use getDate(), as it should give you a date object which should have methods to pull off each of those pieces
[17:26:34] <Confoozed> That's what I wondered.
[17:26:53] <Confoozed> Ok - off to play again.  I might be back soon.  Thanks again
[22:56:09] <skypce> hello all
[22:56:38] <skypce> can you help me with this? http://pastebin.com/1ikRmdc7  i need that < 767px insert a element after other
[23:20:13] <ar1a> hey all :)
[23:20:36] <ar1a> I was wanting to create a single page application, and figured i'd go back to basics and just use jquery. Can anyone recommend any resources for me to check out?
[23:47:21] <aiena> the function you bind to a click event can also be a named function right. E.g. $("#someId").click(someFunc(fixedParam1));
[23:47:33] <aiena> and that named function will trigger each time it is clicked
[23:51:34] <ar1a> aiena: like $("#someId").click(someFunc);
[23:52:04] <aiena> ar1a,  yes except somefunc could have some fixed parameters too
[23:52:20] <aiena> e.g. someFunc(i)
[23:52:42] <aiena> but ud the first works there is no reason why with fixed params it should not work
[23:55:06] <aiena> *if
[23:59:06] <aiena> hmm strange
