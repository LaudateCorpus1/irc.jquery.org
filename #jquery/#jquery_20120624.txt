[00:00:12] <Whirl3d_> StayInSkool, you'll have to tell us how it is...
[00:00:24] <xboi209> so no ones gonna help me :/
[00:00:54] <sacho> you have a higher chance of getting help if you ask smart questions
[00:00:59] <shoky> xboi209 it'd help if you didnt have html in your javascript
[00:01:31] <xboi209> o.o
[00:02:36] <LoneStar99> someprimetime:  ok works great, so animate will make it fade in and out?
[00:03:14] <someprimetime> LoneStar99: nah it just makes the transition smoother
[00:03:25] <someprimetime> you want to use hide().fadeIn() to fade something in and out
[00:03:45] <LoneStar99> ok let me look into animate
[00:05:32] <sacho> xboi209, the javascript portion of jsfiddle already embeds your code in a script tag, and in fact, in a specific loader function(one that you can pick from the left side). You don't need <script> tags there.
[00:08:20] <StayInSkool> Whirl3d_: which, the Katy Perry one?!?!

[00:15:59] <donnaR> hey is it possible to have an xmlhttprequest inside an xmlhttprequest callback, my browser doesnt seem responding to it
[00:16:38] <donnaR> $.get('test', function (){ $.get('test2'); } );
[00:17:53] <Blaster> how would I have to pass data to $.ajax in order to form a querystring like ?networks[]=1&networks[]=2  ?   My array is like [1, 2]
[00:35:28] <diverdude> in php, i can use Imagick to create an imagesignature from an image. Basically it loads the image and calculates a hash value from the binary data. Is anything like that actually possible to do on the client? It would save the server quite a lot of load if the client could do this job.
[00:39:30] <shoky> donnaR: it should work fine
[00:40:59] <shoky> Blaster: yeah you need to pass data. (unless you're appending it all to the url, but dont)
[00:41:27] <Quickq> hi all.. just curious, is there a way to print all the methods in a jquery object?
[00:41:35] <shoky> Blaster: whoops just saw your question started with 'how'
[00:41:47] <Dr-Bombay> diverdude: you can draw an image into a hidden canvas element and do whatever you want with the pixel values. It won't work for animations.
[00:42:41] <diverdude> Dr-Bombay: it should not do any kind of animation. just calculate hash value....canvas is only working in very new browsers right?
[00:43:00] <Dr-Bombay> somewhat new browsers
[00:44:02] <Dr-Bombay> quickg: foreach / typeof / instanceof
[00:44:31] <papelboyl1> Does anyone have any suggestion in accessing an xml in another domain? I'm getting a "no transport" error. thanks :)
[00:45:23] <papelboyl1> well I've searched and the only suggestion I found helpful is to set jQuery.support.cors = true but still not working.
[00:46:07] <shoky> Blaster:  { 'networks[]': [1,2] }
[00:49:37] <Whirl3d_> papelboyl1, you might look at tha ajaxian website. Someone posted a link earlier that made it sound pretty simple...Can't vouch for it, but it sounded good..
[00:49:42] <shoky> Blaster: if you're POSTing data though, or just want a way to build the querystring, use   $.param( { 'networks[]': [1,2] } )
[00:50:04] <papelboyl1> thank you. I'm looking now :)
[00:51:05] <Ancient> Who can I talk to about having a bug re-opened?
[00:52:12] <Ancient> Someone's already contributed a working patch to the bug, but trac-o-bot automatically closed it
[00:53:20] <Ancient> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11249 link for reference
[00:57:08] <donnaR> shoky, yeah sadly it doesn't
[00:57:55] <shoky> donnaR: what browser?
[01:00:02] <Whirl3d_> so, shoky, when you have to do a gallery script, do you keep the "current" item and the "current contents" (meaning all the items in the group of items you are viewing) in a global variable? or do you rely on the dom to keep that by manipulating classes/visibility and selecting for conditions indicating "current" ...?
[01:00:12] <papelboyl1> whirl3d: will I technically avoid the problem if I'm trying to access a php file that gives me an xml file?
[01:01:13] <Whirl3d_> papelboyl1, I have to be honest, it's way outside my skillset. I was just passing on the info that I heard earlier and added to my list of "explore later" topics. Sorry I can't be of more help.
[01:01:39] <papelboyl1> no problem. :)
[01:04:13] <Murg|e> I a jquery plugin runs on page load. Is there some restriction for it running again after $.ajax success: ?
[01:04:18] <Murg|e> *If a
[01:13:52] <Cerales> Can anyone tell me why the error() handler on $.ajax() would be called if the response code is 200?
[01:14:22] <Cerales> it looks like the 'error' attribute i pass to $.ajax is getting called with the response body, and the response body is what i expect it to be.
[01:53:05] <finspin> hi, jquery beginner here. im trying to figure out how to post a list of values to my django/python page via ajax call. Here is what I have so far. The problem is that only the first id is always posted. http://pastebin.com/g6DM3QyS. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[02:06:55] <Dr-Bombay> finspin: is your server expecting multiple ids in one call?
[02:10:10] <papelboyl1> I have a php code that return 2 numbers separated by comma. When I try to access it (it's on another domain), I'm getting an error. I thought cross-domain scripting is limited to xml? thank you
[02:11:53] <sacho> wat
[02:12:04] <sacho> What would lead you to think that?
[02:12:13] <Cerales> finspin: the values declaration line - shouldn't it be values = [1,2] ?
[02:12:20] <Cerales> rather than = (1,2)?
[02:13:39] <Cerales> papelboyl1: cross-domain scripting is a restriction applied to requests that use the XMLHTTPRequest object in a browser. despite the name, that object is used for all AJAX requests, regardless of content type.
[02:14:04] <Cerales> papelboyl1: However, if it's a simple GET request, you should be able to make the request as long as you use the appropriate headers on both the client and server sides.
[02:14:42] <papelboyl1> ohhh
[02:14:56] <papelboyl1> I never put any headers
[02:15:09] <Cerales> papelboyl1: this document is a bit convoluted, but if you look through it you'll get the idea: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control
[02:15:23] <papelboyl1> if I view source on the php, it'll literally just display "1,2,"
[02:15:28] <papelboyl1> I'll look into it
[02:15:30] <papelboyl1> thank you :)
[02:15:35] <Cerales> basically, the access-control-allow-origin headers on the server side are key,
[02:15:38] <MACscr> so if i want to validate a form field, lets say a phone number and i want to do it before the form is submitted, what method should I use? Should i do it when the field loses focus?
[02:15:58] <papelboyl1> thanks!
[02:16:18] <Dr-Bombay> let's see... no he's not on any other channels
[02:27:25] <sacho> huh?
[02:28:02] <sacho> MACscr, there's a lot of points in time "before the submit" when you could validate it, which one you pick is your choice
[02:28:27] <sacho> There's a list for built-in events for html elements on mdn.
[02:36:25] <MACscr> sacho: i got a solution thats working great in jsfiddle, but when i add it to my actual html, im getting Unexpected token ILLEGAL in console. I dont se whats wrong with it: http://pastie.org/4141938
[02:36:37] <MACscr> its pointing to the last line
[02:37:55] <sacho> seems like a completely unneeded function expression
[02:38:42] <Whirl3d> MACscr, this is gonna sound bogus, but I had that happen the other day and I couldn't find the problem...until I deleted the trailing spaces after my last line...apparently there was a hidden character or something...may not be your issue, but its worth a try?
[02:39:41] <sacho> anyway, do you have a page replicating the issue?
[02:43:27] <Whirl3d> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3143698/uncaught-syntaxerror-unexpected-token
[02:44:27] <Whirl3d> seems like I'm not the only one with the peculiar instance of hidden characters (or maybe tabs) causing an illegal token error.
[02:45:37] <MACscr> http://jsfiddle.net/GcATB/37/
[02:45:51] <MACscr> thats the code working, but again, i dont get the error there
[02:47:09] <MACscr> sacho: its in an admin area, so i dont have any public examples
[02:47:25] * sacho shrugs
[02:50:06] <MACscr> lol, i simply viewed the jsfiddle output from in firefox, then viewed its source and copy and pasted it from there to my script and it works perfectly now. LOL
[02:53:18] <Whirl3d> Chrome is doing some wierd things with it's encoding for tabs that other people have complained about. They appear to be blanks, but some editors trip up on them. They also indicate that this problem does not exist with Firefox. I'm not saying that's the issue, but it could be.
[02:55:01] <finspin> Cerales: you were right about the square brackets, thanks! Now onto the new problem :)
[02:59:55] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to jquery and have a question, I'm not sure if I'm doing it right … but i make an ajax call on an url like $get(/basket/add/item/32/, function(responseText) { console.log(response)});  it works fine, the backend receives the params of the url, and returns a json response like "ok" … i can see it in charles. but the response is not returned in the console. someone a hint for me what I'm doing wrong?
[03:01:59] <Dr-Bombay> probably not without seeing your actual get call. paste it on a pasting site
[03:05:19] <mightym> Dr-Bombay: the get call is just the url without passing an data
[03:06:25] <Dr-Bombay> I want to see exactly how you are using $.get
[03:08:40] <mightym> Dr-Bombay: http://pastie.org/4142066
[03:10:52] <Dr-Bombay> try logging (typeof responseText)
[03:11:16] <Dr-Bombay> also, check that your server is sending JSON as the content type
[03:11:31] <Dr-Bombay> (not literally 'JSON' but the content type for JSON)
[03:12:06] <mightym> Dr-Bombay: the problem is that the callback isn't called, i already checked by console.log('bla')
[03:13:54] <mightym> but the response header from the server is: 	HTTP/1.0 200 OK … Content-Type	application/json
[03:16:05] <Dr-Bombay> replace $.get with the $.ajax equivalent in the documentation for get, and add an error callback.
[03:25:16] <mightym> Dr-Bombay: yes i already that, same problem. maybe its not a good way to call i url with the data included in the url, maybe its better to pass the data, via an second argument in jquery
[04:04:04] <sketchy_fiction> hi channel
[04:05:06] <sketchy_fiction> i need to make a simple hover function so when i hover over a link the background will darken when im over a link
[04:05:13] <sketchy_fiction> any help?
[04:06:19] <ravenzz> can't you do that in css?
[04:06:39] <ravenzz> or are you talking about the body bg or what?
[04:06:54] <sketchy_fiction> yeah the body bg
[04:07:07] <ravenzz> ?hover @ sketchy_fiction
[04:07:08] <caniuse> sketchy_fiction: .hover(): Bind a single handler to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters or leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[04:07:36] <ravenzz> if you don't know how that can be done, you should read

[04:07:49] <ravenzz> ?g jqueryfundamentals
[04:07:50] <caniuse> ravenzz: jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/

[04:20:23] <risky_shenanigan> having problems with the reset() for resetting a form -> http://jsfiddle.net/HCXXB/
[04:42:32] <bid> is there a problem to do $(document).ready(function(){}) twice in the same js file? i mean beside the fact that it's ugly. i am now changing some old code and i see it showin up twice. so i want to understand why someone will do that or maybe it's just a bug...
[04:49:13] <ravenzz> bid you can, they well be executed in order
[04:49:14] <Haprog> bid: not really.
[05:05:18] <thanpolas> how is testAsync() different from using stop() / start() ?
[05:05:23] <thanpolas> (in QUnit)
[05:13:00] <bjensen> how do does one handle dom changes for for example date pickers? Its initialized in the document.ready, but new date pickers come in and isn't registered with it..
[05:14:40] <Haprog> bjensen: you could use .live or .delegate
[05:14:56] <Haprog> or better yet. run the datepicker initialization right after changing the dom
[05:14:57] <bjensen> Haprog: delegate works with plugins?
[05:15:15] <Haprog> in whatever code changes the dom
[05:15:34] <Haprog> why wouldn't it? it just watches for changes in the dom?
[05:15:48] <bjensen> Haprog: right but that would be very extensive wouldn't it? Having to reinit $(".datepicker").datepicker() each time a new dom element is being pulled in using ajax
[05:16:02] <Haprog> doh... not like that
[05:16:09] <Haprog> just apply it to the new element ofcourse
[05:16:14] <Haprog> not all of class datepicker
[05:16:55] <Haprog> depends on your html what selector you need to use to select only the new element
[05:17:07] <bjensen> yeah I was thinking of that..
[05:17:33] <bjensen> like make a random class for the new element and then bind it to that
[05:17:45] <laszlof> or just assign an id to it
[05:17:47] <laszlof> or use the name
[05:17:58] <laszlof> or use the parent class plus its own class
[05:18:16] <bjensen> yeah target it specifically
[05:18:26] <Haprog> or just create it as a jQuery object, then apply .datepicker() then append to DOM or whatever
[05:18:31] <laszlof> yup
[05:18:43] <laszlof> that would be the best way, but I'm not sure how you're creating them
[05:18:48] <bjensen> but I was hoping I could get away with something simpler.
[05:19:09] <laszlof> how are you adding new datepickers?
[05:19:26] <Haprog> like $('<div />').addClass('datepicker').appendTo(some_element).datepicker()
[05:19:32] <Haprog> or something like that
[05:19:33] <bjensen> its on ajax pages being loaded into the dom
[05:19:40] <bjensen> there are forms being loaded in
[05:19:48] <Haprog> but you probably need input instead of div
[05:20:12] <Haprog> so you basicly load readymade HTML and append that to the dom?
[05:20:14] <laszlof> bjensen: oh,thats easy.. on the success of the ajax call, just use the container of the ajax pages as a selector
[05:20:28] <Haprog> yeah, like laszlof said
[05:20:30] <laszlof> the id/class of the container, and .datepicker
[05:20:55] <bjensen> well I can't control how its being loaded in
[05:20:57] <Haprog> use the container as a context for the selector
[05:21:11] <laszlof> bjensen: you're loading the data into a div right?
[05:21:20] <Haprog> $('.datepicker', mycontainer).datepicker();
[05:21:28] <bjensen> Im loading the form into a modal container
[05:21:32] <laszlof> <div id="container">//ajax content here//</div>
[05:21:47] <laszlof> $('#container .datepicker').datepicker();
[05:22:56] <bjensen> cool thanks.
[05:25:28] <bjensen> Cant I listen to the changes of the modal? So it would say $(".modal").on("change", function(){$(".datepicker").datepicker();}) would that work?
[05:27:54] <bjensen> ping Haprog and laszlof :)
[05:28:08] <laszlof> im pretty sure .change is only for input elements
[05:28:21] <Haprog> hmm I just realized .on has superseded .delegate in 1.7
[05:28:55] <laszlof> try DOMNodeInserted and DOMNodeRemoved
[05:29:18] <laszlof> or DOMSubtreeModified
[05:29:24] <laszlof> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4979738/fire-jquery-event-on-div-change
[05:29:32] <bjensen> but isn't that a better idea?
[05:29:43] <laszlof> 6 of one, half dozen of another
[05:30:23] <bjensen> ok thanks
[05:32:39] <bjensen> I could also scan the incoming content when using $.get for the date picker class..if its present then invoke the date picker() on it. Don't know which is most expensive though
[05:33:26] <Haprog> bjensen: just do $('#container .datepicker').datepicker();
[05:33:42] <Haprog> always when the ajax update is finished
[05:34:27] <Haprog> that's probably the best method for your situation
[05:34:47] <bjensen> yeah I think your right..Im on my way  too deeo
[05:34:48] <bjensen> deep
[05:38:32] <shadykhan> im using a lightbox-esque plugin and i was wondering how can i go about disabling it on the mobile version only?
[05:48:04] <AcademyIntl> Hey there!  Really simple question:  I have a date object and am making a pretty ##:##:## HH:MM:SS display .  How do I force the 0 on numbers such as 05 for minutes and seconds?
[05:48:18] <AcademyIntl> Current: $(this).html('[' + dt.getHours() + ':' + dt.getMinutes() + ':' + dt.getSeconds() + ']');
[05:49:26] <bjensen> I am having this issue https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/issues/114 and I would like to help find a solution for it. Anyone have an idea for a starting point? Just need to get started
[05:49:26] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #114 on bootstrap-datepicker (jhlive; 2d, 21h ago): Don't set te value on text field
[05:49:41] <Haprog> AcademyIntl: for example http://www.electrictoolbox.com/pad-number-zeroes-javascript/
[05:50:22] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: Yes, I figured there was a more elagent solution given by locales or something within the Date object however.
[05:50:39] <Haprog> Not sure, I haven't used the Date object
[05:51:04] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: Example:  some sort of format_date function such as PHP's date('[h:i:s]', $timestamp); function.
[05:51:15] <shadykhan> im using lightbox on my website is there a way to disable it on the mobile version only?
[05:51:29] <AcademyIntl> shadykhan: Yeah, don't include the js file for lightbox on the mobile site..
[05:53:19] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: As I cam converting en masse thousands of timestamps on the page to this format (for the sake of local timezone from a utc unix_timestamp) doing string concatenation padding such as that would... be a great performance downfall for me, if it can be avoided.
[05:54:26] <Haprog> I'd guess basic string concatenation would probably be faster than any other alternative
[05:54:35] <Haprog> not sure though
[05:55:45] <Haprog> There doesn't seem to be any builtin method in JS to do that, but if you use jQuery UI there seems to be $.datepicker.formatDate()
[05:56:03] <Haprog> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/formatDate
[05:57:06] <Haprog> hmm I guess that doesn't handle times though..
[05:58:26] <Haprog> AcademyIntl: http://momentjs.com/
[05:58:34] <shadykhan> AcademyIntl, what do you mean not include the js file for the mobile site?
[05:58:49] <shadykhan> im using media queries for the css so it scales down appropriately
[05:59:00] <shoky> anybody know how to reload/refresh a file from disk in pico/nano :D
[05:59:01] <Haprog> lightbox is JS isn't it?
[05:59:29] <AcademyIntl> shadykhan: For lightbox to work; the lightbox js file needs to be loaded somehow (header, direct insert into a script tag, etc).  Just simply do not load this on the mobile site...
[05:59:41] <Haprog> shoky: close and reopen? :D
[05:59:55] <shoky> ;p

[07:41:58] <m1chael> ok i did.. nothing is showing in the console at all now ;/
[07:42:30] <m1chael> im still getting the hit on my web server
[07:42:45] <johnkpaul> m1chael: what browser are you using?
[07:43:05] <m1chael> firefox12
[07:43:17] <johnkpaul> m1chael: with firebug installed?
[07:43:32] <yotam> are you doing a cross domain request?
[07:43:47] <m1chael> im using the built-in web developer web console
[07:43:59] <johnkpaul> m1chael: installed firebug
[07:44:14] <m1chael> i am doing a cross domain request, and i have csrf protection disabled on my server
[07:44:15] <johnkpaul> also, answer yotam's question, that's a good thought
[07:44:29] <johnkpaul> m1chael: but did you also send the CORS headers?
[07:44:50] <m1chael> i dont know what CORS is
[07:44:58] <johnkpaul> ah, then taht's probably the problem
[07:45:06] <johnkpaul> ?g cross origin resource sharing @ m1chael
[07:45:08] <bot-t> m1chael, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
[07:45:18] <johnkpaul> ah, I was hoping for the wikipedia page
[07:45:32] <johnkpaul> m1chael: you need to add headers to your response for jquery to be able to successfully make a cross origin request
[07:45:46] <m1chael> http://dpaste.com/762931/
[07:45:55] <m1chael> ah
[07:46:18] <johnkpaul> m1chael: https://gist.github.com/1093416
[07:46:38] <johnkpaul> I'm making the assumption you're using django
[07:49:40] <m1chael> that was it!
[07:49:48] <m1chael> this is great
[07:50:20] <m1chael> i'm trying to make an app that will list items on ebay via an ajax checkbox
[07:50:57] <m1chael> so i need firebug in order to use console.log ?
[07:50:57] <bjensen> how can I make sure I don't use #on more than once? is there a way I can ask if its already enabled?
[07:51:03] <bjensen> for a given element ofcause
[07:51:33] <johnkpaul> m1chael: no, but firebug's console.log is nicer IIRC
[07:51:40] <johnkpaul> bjensen: what is #on?
[07:51:51] <bjensen> um the method on
[07:52:04] <bjensen> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:52:24] <johnkpaul> bjensen: you mean you don't want to add a handler twice?
[07:52:34] <johnkpaul> you could .off('click').on('click',handlr)
[07:55:19] <bjensen> johnkpaul:  but it doesn't seam to work for me. Im doing $("body).on("click", ".date_picker", function() { alert("hello world")}), if I try to do $("body", "click", ".date_picker") then it doesn't work..
[07:55:43] <johnkpaul> bjensen: the $ function has no signature like that
[07:56:45] <stakkit> hello everyone!
[08:01:37] <stakkit> i am a newbie of jquery.. i have this problem: i want to remove the url of tabs from url field of browser.. I use the plugin of Klaus Hartl.. this: http://www.dirittimusulmani.it/wp-content/themes/dirittimusulmani/js/jquery.tabs.js  I tried to find window.location.hash but there is not
[08:01:59] <stakkit> to remove url
[08:03:34] <stakkit> can anyone help me?
[08:03:37] <stakkit> thank you!
[08:43:59] <ScottG> Is there a way to get any kind of console debug output in jsfiddle?
[08:46:46] <shoky> ScottG: console.log in your fiddle should output to your browser's console
[08:47:08] <shoky> ScottG: you can also use 'jquery edge' and then check the firebug box
[08:47:14] <shoky> and have an embedded firebug in yer fiddle
[08:47:56] <ScottG> shoky: Oh you're right it does. Not sure why I didn't check this. Thank you!
[08:53:07] <bjensen> how is it again fi I want to select any item when using [] like I want to look for all elements that has a $("[rel=tooltip]"), i need to add something affront of the [ to tell its any item..
[08:56:44] <thomedy> i have a concern i have been googling about hash changes and i think im going to write my hash change a bit different then the usual plugin.... involving an array and .push() ... with a check for element n and n - 1
[08:57:02] <thomedy> but i also want to use html5's window.history.back()
[08:57:58] <thomedy> i read that i should write both to accomodate for browsers not ready for it... but (enter question) if i have to write both why not just write window.location.hash and run the array instead
[09:07:44] <Nebukadneza> heho
[09:08:03] <shoky> thomedy, why not use history.js ?
[09:08:19] <Nebukadneza> does someone know what happens to many simultaneous $.getJSON calls, all idleing with a long timeout ("COMET" style~)
[09:08:49] <Nebukadneza> because, sometimes it seems that some don't see a reply from the server, and just continue their timeout
[09:10:14] <shoky> bjensen: what?
[09:11:20] <thomedy> i get tired of using librarys that other people wrote... including all this files
[09:11:22] <Haprog> Nebukadneza: have you set a timeout for jQuery ajax?
[09:11:34] <Nebukadneza> yes, some 2 minutes or so
[09:11:41] <shoky> thomedy: use history.js
[09:12:18] <Haprog> thomedy: why are you at #jquery then if you don't like to use libraries? :D
[09:12:27] <thomedy> plus i was reading about the usual version of hash changes that use a setTimeout for the check on what hashs your onw
[09:12:40] <thomedy> and i agree haprog im close to going straight js pretty soon
[09:12:51] <thomedy> its just a thing in me
[09:13:01] <thomedy> animating and everything with js
[09:13:51] <thomedy> plus mozilla devel network doesn't have jquery in its tutes so going straight js will make me feel better i dont know i know that its a quirk but and in all likely hood it wont happen but... it wears on me
[09:15:56] <thomedy> jquery feels like cheating to me sometimes
[09:15:57] <shoky> none of that sounds like a good reason.. (except 'its a thing in me')
[09:16:56] <shoky> if you dont want it to feel like cheating, read the jquery source code
[09:17:05] <shoky> then you can pretend you wrote it yourself, if that makes you feel better
[09:17:08] <thomedy> i already got it
[09:17:09] <thomedy> so i can
[09:17:15] <thomedy> i just havent had time to yet
[09:17:21] <Nebukadneza> Haprog: but ... what does that tell us?
[09:17:26] <thomedy> i remember you or someone saying that earlier it seemd genius
[09:17:34] <shoky> most of us just prefer to get things done without repeating what others have already solved beautifully
[09:17:46] <Haprog> Nebukadneza: what?
[09:17:53] <thomedy> i hear that all the time... my thing is that i need all creative freedom i can
[09:17:59] <thomedy> its a big drive in  me
[09:18:27] <Nebukadneza> Haprog: i mean, yes, i set a timeout, but ... why does that change the behavior on handlers when data arrives?
[09:18:42] <thomedy> am i calling for the back button or am i looking for some other event
[09:19:05] <shoky> are we here or are we there
[09:19:22] <shoky> what doth laife
[09:19:25] <thomedy> im confused by that comment
[09:19:57] <Haprog> I have no idea what you mean. Setting the timeout shouldn't affect anything else.
[09:20:29] <thomedy> are you talking to me haprog
[09:20:40] <shoky> he isn't
[09:20:46] <thomedy> perfect cuz i was lost
[09:20:49] <shoky> ;D
[09:20:50] <thomedy> now im better
[09:22:04] <Haprog> thomedy: no
[09:22:48] <Nebukadneza> Haprog: well, yeah
[09:22:51] <thomedy> got it...... has anyone written their own hash change or am i stuck with history.js
[09:22:53] <Nebukadneza> but then what could be the problem?
[09:23:25] <thomedy> well im just curious if im calling on the back button click or if it is some other event before i ull window.location.hash
[09:24:21] <shoky> you seem to be stuck withOUT history.js :P
[09:26:47] <thomedy> nice pun shocky but think again.... im doing some googling too and i found window.onbeforeunload
[09:26:49] <thomedy> boom
[09:32:04] <Nebukadneza> argh
[09:32:15] <Nebukadneza> how to nicely add a enter keypress handler for a input field Oo
[09:32:23] <thomedy> oh better than that

[09:35:49] <Robbington> Hi, can anyone tell me why jQuery(iframe).contents().find('div') console logs out nothing?
[09:36:26] <Robbington> Or more specifically an empty node
[09:44:34] <thanpolas> can someone explain what effect QUnit.config.urlConfig.push('min');  has? --> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/index.html#L20
[09:54:52] <Robbington> Hi, can anyone tell me why jQuery(iframe).contents().find('div') console logs out nothing?  #
[10:03:47] <iamcurio> can anyone help me with putting a php inline inside js. currently have some issues. see example code here: http://pastebin.com/nLxFzzqX
[10:04:52] <Jon47> Robbington: generally querying the contents of an iframe from a window context will result in an unsafe access attempt
[10:04:54] <jonno11> I'm fairly experienced with javascript - but the inheritance (public/private) variable system still is confusing me… why is this not working? http://pastebin.com/T4X4PxUS
[10:05:47] <Jon47> just think about it, if you could open an iframe to another site and then modify it however you wanted, you could do all sorts of crazy things to the contents of that site, things the owner would never want you to do, it would ruin the interoperability of the web
[10:06:19] <Jon47> if the domain, protocol, and ports match you may be able to access it
[10:06:51] <Jon47> never tried that but theoretically it may work..
[10:07:07] <Nebukadneza> argh
[10:07:26] <Jon47> jonno11: the function creates a new scope
[10:07:29] <Nebukadneza> why is $("#someDiv").height() not updated when i .append() something to that div?
[10:07:30] <shoky> jonno11: why are you adding properties to 'this' ?
[10:07:32] <Jon47> so "this" changes
[10:13:02] <cognominal> is there a way to test in jquery that the element `elt` is not of class `foo`?
[10:13:03] <shoky> Nebukadneza: cause the div's height isn't changing :P
[10:14:18] <cognominal> shoky?
[10:14:24] <cognominal> can you help?
[10:15:21] <cognominal> ok, found it.   !$(elt).hasClass('foo')
[10:15:25] <finspin> jquery beginner here. how can i pass a list of values (e.g. [1, 2]) via jquery ajax? I'm trying to do this --> data: {terid: [1, 2]}, but when I parse terid on the receiving page it only picks up the second value. Here are the details of my problem http://stackoverflow.com/q/11176594/932210
[10:17:08] <wroathe> Hey guys. I'm having a problem with the jQuery UI accordion. When the page loads I'm trying to get an ID out of the query string and activate a panel with it. If I pass ?property=0 it tries to activate panel 0 (which is already active). But I want to re-activate that same panel because I'm relying on the changestart event to do it's magic.
[10:18:27] <cognominal> in #jquery, no one can hear you scream, very unlike #haskell  :(
[10:19:22] <cognominal> and the same amount of people, so the comparaison matters
[10:19:34] <MysterOnyx> what on earth is haskell programming language?
[10:19:51] <cognominal> wroathe, finspin. sorry I can't help
[10:22:00] <finspin> cognominal: no worries mate
[10:23:46] <cognominal> finspin, if you find yourselve the answer to your question, post it. It will help
[10:24:13] <rgr> Im looking for some advice/approaches (jquery and/or css) in making a tile on the screen have a bg image which is a section of a larger image depending on that tiles position on the screen. Any suggestions on best way forward?
[10:24:43] <tomasm-> hi, is it normal for a jquery dialog, when it opens, to automatically highlight (select) the first form field? sometimes there's a value already in the first form field and the habit is to start typing, but it'll write over the value instead of typing into the NEXT field. even with a focus() on the next field when the modal opens, it still keeps focus on the first form field. is this automatic or is there maybe some code somewhere doin
[10:24:43] <tomasm-> g this?
[10:24:43] <caniuse> tomasm-: This TV Home - The Bay Area - KTNC A free, premium channel for ... - http://www.thistv.com/
[10:25:10] <tomasm-> caniuse, WTF?
[10:27:28] <tomasm-> how do I go about debugging events on an object? I thought .data("events") was stripped out
[10:32:06] <MysterOnyx> I have a bunch of elements on my page that are populated by jquery AJAX from a database on page load. Would it be better to load the data into arrays rather than directly to the elements? I'm concerned about severely slowing down my site if every element and subsequent changes to those elements run AJAX at every turn.
[10:37:18] <tomasm-> MysterOnyx, if you're calling your db more than once, especially if it's only on page load, DONT.... switch it over to a single call and store the full form data into an array, then loop to load each field
[10:37:21] <thomedy> okay i broke down due to a long conversation with js people and i grabbed history.js
[10:37:33] <thomedy> now im teaching myself history.js
[10:38:17] <MysterOnyx> tomasm- so I'm clear, you're saying don't call the db more than once, but rather do a single call storing data into arrays
[10:38:31] <ravenzz> return a json object
[10:38:39] <MysterOnyx> right that's what I'm doing now
[10:38:43] <ravenzz> and populate the dom into the client
[10:38:47] <tomasm-> MysterOnyx, get data in bulk if it isn't a problem
[10:38:56] <comet`> im using something like that actually
[10:39:01] <MysterOnyx> now here's the thing
[10:39:10] <comet`> using hashs to show different content on the same page
[10:39:24] <comet`> what events fire on hash change though?
[10:39:59] <ravenzz> the hash is appended to the url when you click a link usually
[10:40:24] <MysterOnyx> at page load, I call a bulk of data. I have no problem storing said data into arrays / vars to be used on the page. However, when I modify an element, I'm going to send this modified data back to the DB. No problem there, but then after modification, I don't want to have the page recall the entire bulk of database data...
[10:40:51] <comet`> ravenzz: yeah, and then by dynamically changing the hash
[10:41:02] <MysterOnyx> what I mean is I don't want the result of AJAX success to be "ok let's repopulate the entire page"
[10:41:34] <tomasm-> MysterOnyx, you should have different urls for the json page load and the field modification
[10:41:39] <MysterOnyx> yea
[10:41:55] <tomasm-> to provide only the relevent information, but still keeping it efficient
[10:42:00] <MysterOnyx> but when the page is loaded, a single function called display() runs which populates all of the elements
[10:42:02] <MysterOnyx> and arrays
[10:42:11] <ravenzz> or have some logic on the backend that can handle both cases
[10:42:27] <tomasm-> MysterOnyx, so what's your problem?
[10:42:36] <MysterOnyx> so at the moment, when one element is modified, AJAX success calls display() which repopulates the entire page
[10:42:55] <MysterOnyx> seems unnecessary to repopulate the entire page, but maybe that's the best thing to do
[10:43:05] <tomasm-> MysterOnyx, so then fix that. field modification/validation should only really relate to that exact field
[10:43:10] <MysterOnyx> yea
[10:44:51] <MysterOnyx> I think I know how to solve this. I could make a separate function that refreshes certain groups of elements. then at page load, I can have display ( call function1() call function2() ); and then when I modify a certain element after the page has loaded, I can just do AJAX success: call function1(); for example
[10:45:38] <MysterOnyx> so on page load, all separate functions that refresh the elements are run at once, and after that, I can call individual functions to update specific parts of the page
[10:47:20] <yassine> anyone of you guys can sortout why im only seein the first slide of my carousel in here? http://atlasloewenherz.dyndns.org/carousel.html
[10:48:22] <ML74> can someone help me with a slight problem? i'm trying to add a class to a wordpress menu item on page load, but it doesn't seem to be working. is the following code correct:	jQuery(window).load(function() {
[10:48:22] <ML74> 		jQuery(".page-item-20").addClass("navhead");
[10:48:23] <ML74> 	});
[10:48:26] <yassine> i must be doing something wrong using the following plugin : http://thomaslanciaux.pro/jquery/jquery_carousel.htm
[10:49:28] <tomasm-> yassine, left is moving wrong, it's offsetting it to -960 each loop
[10:50:20] <ML74> can someone help me with a slight problem? i'm trying to add a class to a wordpress menu item on page load, but it doesn't seem to be working. is the following code correct:	jQuery(window).load(function() {
[10:50:20] <ML74>                   jQuery(".page-item-20").addClass("navhead");
[10:50:26] <ML74>          });
[10:50:33] <thomedy> does anyone know of a solid tut on history.js
[10:50:34] <yassine> tomasm-: i was thinking that is the correct behaviour since its alway offsetting to - n*960 which is my slide width
[10:50:43] <thomedy> i cant find anything like jquery.com has with its website
[10:50:47] <thomedy> i see stackoverflow
[10:50:52] <thomedy> and i see the github
[10:51:03] <thomedy> but im really hoping for a doc group and waht not
[10:51:35] <MysterOnyx> thomedy is your nickname a combination of thomas and comedy
[10:52:33] <thomedy> indeed
[10:52:39] <MysterOnyx> nice
[10:52:41] <thomedy> i was an improv comic in california
[10:52:46] <MysterOnyx> wow nice
[10:53:08] <thomedy> and want to move to chicago once i get  my businesses running in such a way that i can maintain a family of 2 kids and my wife
[10:53:28] <thomedy> my friend called me it once and i loved it
[10:53:53] <thomedy> do you know a good tut on history.js something like the api portion of jquery.com
[10:53:54] <MysterOnyx> it's clever
[10:54:05] <MysterOnyx> I don't unfortunately
[10:54:27] <thomedy>  i have been given less clever names too but usually my wife and are fighting when that happens
[10:54:48] <MysterOnyx> lol
[10:54:50] <thomedy> that was an easy joke and im not sorry
[10:55:03] <thomedy> now im laughing
[10:55:04] <thomedy> ha
[10:59:22] <Whirl3d> thomedy, you really should consider ben allmans hashcahnge plugin. Lots of folks use .bbq, but I found it to be too complicated for my needs..
[10:59:26] <Whirl3d> ?bbq
[10:59:27] <bot-t> BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[11:00:40] <thomedy> im at the point now where i have been going in circles and i just want something to work... if .bbq is it then fine with me
[11:00:51] <thomedy> your amazing i m just kinda frustrated
[11:02:10] <Whirl3d> just use the hashchange portion until you get more into it. The hashchange plugin allows you to handle navigation easily and provides the bookmarkable and back functions you need without all the deparameter stuff that you don't need right now...
[11:02:20] <sgp913_> hey everyone, i was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction to learn how to verify form input for a phone number, and check if there is a 0 in the front as well as the proper amount of digits, then just remove the 0 for the variable and tack on a country code
[11:02:48] <thomedy> i think im just goingt o use body onhashchange= 'function()' and then do it myself
[11:03:13] <thomedy> i grow tired of searching code to learn something when i could learn to write it myself
[11:03:14] <Whirl3d> Doesn't work on older browsers
[11:03:19] <thomedy> thank you
[11:03:22] <thomedy> good to know
[11:03:47] <Whirl3d> hence you need the plugin. It's unobtrusive...just load it and it gives you the same functions in all browsers.
[11:04:09] <Whirl3d> it doesn't feel like  aplugin with a complicated api or any of the bs that accompanies some plugins
[11:04:28] <thomedy> damn
[11:04:29] <thomedy> okay
[11:04:30] <thomedy> fine
[11:04:40] <thomedy> which one are we on .bbq
[11:04:47] <Whirl3d> no
[11:04:52] <Whirl3d> bbq gets complicated
[11:04:56] <thomedy> okay im listening
[11:04:59] <Whirl3d> just use the hashcnage plugin
[11:05:11] <thomedy> im sorry to repeat myself but which one
[11:05:22] <Whirl3d> all it does is provide the hashchange event to non-hashchange enabled browsers
[11:05:23] <thomedy> this is jus ta jquery hashchange plugin
[11:05:35] <Whirl3d> ?hashchange
[11:05:35] <bot-t> Ben Alman's hashchange enables very basic bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser HTML5 window.onhashchange event. http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[11:05:49] <TimTim> ^ Whirl3d ftw
[11:06:06] <Whirl3d> Bot-T is back! ...yeah. bot-t ftw!
[11:06:28] <thomedy> i thank you
[11:06:31] <thomedy> and im hungry
[11:07:01] <Whirl3d> TimTim, 8)
[11:07:47] <thomedy> peace out
[11:13:15] <shwaiil> hi
[11:13:34] <shoky> hellow
[11:14:12] <shwaiil> Q: If I have a UL LI's, where <li data-group="someGroup">. What's the best way to get only the elements with a given data-group ? Thanks for looking!
[11:14:42] <Haprog> shwaiil: attribute selector
[11:14:58] <Haprog> shwaiil: $('li[data-group="someGroup"]')
[11:15:14] <shwaiil> Haprog: thanks a lot for your attention!
[11:15:18] <shwaiil> :)
[11:16:21] <Haprog> Not sure if that would work if the data property is set dynamically with .data() though.
[11:17:07] <shwaiil> I'm thinking
[11:17:17] <shoky> it wouldn't
[11:19:53] <poppiez> if I have a bunch of attributes like so data-params-test="1" data-params-teest="2", how do I select all data-params-* attributes?
[11:22:40] <shoky> poppiez: whatcha mean by selecting attributes
[11:23:00] <poppiez> shoky: I want to build an object of all the data-params-* for an element
[11:23:08] <shoky> oh
[11:23:16] <poppiez> so in this case, it would be { test: 1, teest: 2 }
[11:23:54] <poppiez> there might be a nifty jquery feature I could leverage
[11:24:06] <Whirl3d> you can access the data-prefixed attributes in the data object but not the other way around. That is to say that adding "data" parameters does not necessarily add the data-prefixed attributes.
[11:24:36] <shoky> poppiez sec
[11:26:26] <poppiez> Whirl3d: yeah but they get uppercased
[11:26:35] <poppiez> Whirl3d: it would be paramsTest=1, paramsTeest=2
[11:27:55] <iLogic> has anyone faced the problem of loading a slideshow plugin after an ajax request? mine loads fine the first time, but after the second and specially after the third time the caption animation goes totally haywire :(
[11:28:37] <shwaiil> Q: Assuming <p class="foo">Hello world!</p> When doing var el = $('.foo'), if I wanted to place it in $(body).html(el); It wouldn't be valid, but is there a way to do it ? Tks
[11:28:39] <bluepnume> Does anyone know if it's possible to make an element both draggable and selectable with jqueryui?
[11:29:21] <shwaiil> I supose the answer is $(el).html() ?
[11:29:38] <shwaiil> yeah
[11:29:47] <Haprog> shwaiil: $('body').replaceWith(el) ?
[11:29:59] <Haprog> no wait..
[11:30:06] <Haprog> that'll replace the whole body
[11:31:05] <shwaiil> Haprog: actually is a really good tip, for what I want to do. I was now going to do a for each loop based on $(el).html(). maybe this is slow not sure
[11:31:18] <Haprog> shwaiil: $('body').empty().append(el) maybe
[11:33:04] <poppiez> shoky: sup? :)
[11:35:12] <yxz97> Hi
[11:35:32] <shoky> poppiez i can't find a simple way to do it :P
[11:36:06] <yxz97> I want to know what is the complex scenario to query for an object in theDOM using jquery.
[11:36:12] <shwaiil> Q: If we do $('parent').append('child'); Could we select it like $($('parent').append('child')) ? Is this valid ? I'll try it anyway =) tks
[11:36:41] <yxz97> I'm expert using Flex and Java EE…. but now I'm doing some Javascript and I chose to jQuery.
[11:37:09] <poppiez> shoky: hah, me neither :P
[11:37:24] <shwaiil> I supose it doesn't work
[11:37:45] <shoky> yxz97 what do you mean?
[11:38:05] <shoky> you don't need a complex scenario for a need to query the DOM
[11:38:38] <yxz97> Yeah.. I want to jquery for an object that does have a property, style, or id, or a child, with an ID, etc....
[11:38:42] <yxz97> got me idea???
[11:38:57] <shoky> dont understand your question..
[11:39:51] <yxz97> Man I'm expert in Adobe Flex, and JEE, but now I'm using jQuery to build some user interfaces..
[11:39:59] <shoky> shwaiil: X.append(..) returns the original context  (i.e. X)
[11:40:00] <dabear> shwaiil: it will return the parent wrapped in a double jquery object. so it does "work" but it is sub optimal, and doesn't do exactly what you wanted
[11:40:13] <yxz97> I need to know how is able jquery to get me objects I need.. the predicate..
[11:40:38] <shwaiil> Thanks :)
[11:40:44] <shwaiil> shoky, dabear  ;)
[11:40:55] <shoky> yxz97: huh?
[11:41:01] <shoky> smells like a troll
[11:41:25] <yxz97> Troll me cock asshole...
[11:41:42] <yxz97> I'm not a newbie..
[11:41:55] <yxz97> I'm not asking about how turn a computer..
[11:41:57] <yxz97> on
[11:42:07] <yxz97> I'm asking about predicates....
[11:42:16] <psyolus> In the success callback for jQuery.ajax, is it possible to access the post data that was used for the request?
[11:42:47] <jonno11> I'm a pretty competent JS developer - but I still don't fully understand how public/private vars work in JS. Can anyone tell me why this code is throwing an error?
[11:42:49] <jonno11> http://pastebin.com/T4X4PxUS
[11:43:02] <Whirl3d> poppies, what is the problem you are having? you need to de-camelcase your parameter names?
[11:43:19] <shoky> yxz97: LOL
[11:43:24] <shoky> predicates, you say
[11:47:01] <shoky> poppiez:  $.grep( $('#element')[0].attributes, function(attr) { return attr.name.indexOf('data-params-') == 0 } )
[11:47:27] <shoky> no idea if that .attributes is cross-browser safe though ;p
[11:47:31] <poppiez> shoky: nice solution. this is what I came up with: http://pastie.org/private/oojvv49byisznuiebqjk1q
[11:47:57] <shoky> ;P
[12:33:36] <Doxin> I keep getting "GET http://localhost/security_monitor/[object%20Object] 404 (Not Found)" while I never mention that url anywhere, what gives?
[12:35:54] <fuchstronaut_> (Doxin): post code
[12:36:11] <fuchstronaut_> obviously you are throwing in an object where there should be a string
[12:37:06] <yaazkal> Hello everyone I'm been around 2 days on this irc channetl looking for help. I've created a question on stackoverflow if you can help me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11180598/jquery-is-not-catching-click-on-some-content-loaded
[12:38:36] <Hippie_> yaazkal, why not just .click() ?
[12:39:24] <yaazkal> Hippie_, the contet is loaded trough ajax, so dosen't exist in the document at the first load. Using just .click() will not work
[12:39:38] <yaazkal> That's why I'm using .on() instead
[12:40:12] <yaazkal> and not .live() because as I read .live() is deprecated and .on() is replacing it
[12:52:26] <fuchstronaut_> (yaazkal): try delegate()
[12:52:29] <fuchstronaut_> ?delegate
[12:52:31] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[12:54:15] <innociv> What regexp would I need to filter out all "-" that are within {} brackets?  It's to sanitize css, removing negative values without removing .class-name { prop:val; }
[12:54:50] <yaazkal> fuchstronaut_, I'll try. I have no tried it because in the documentation says that .on() event replace .live() and .delegate() ... but I'll try to see what happens
[12:55:34] <gavimobile> where can I find support for google maps api?
[12:56:09] <imissmyjuno> gavimobile: what do you mean by support?
[12:56:47] <shoky> yaazkal you're having trouble using .on ?
[12:57:54] <yaazkal> shoky, the .on() event is working on the div.descripcion that is a dynamic element added. But is not working in the div.imagen element that is also a dynamic content loaded in the same div.step
[12:59:37] <shoky> yaazkal: how are you using it
[13:00:34] <shoky> yaazkal: looking at your links to the working/non working and i dont really see what you're talking about
[13:02:35] <yaazkal> shoky, I have tried some combinations of the .on() event. I have tried $(".step").on("click",".imagen",function(){ ... }); Dosen't work. Then I tried $("#nurse").on("click", ".imagen", function(){ ... }); and nothing
[13:02:49] <shoky> what is .step ?  what is #nurse?  what is .imagen ?
[13:03:59] <yaazkal> shoky, I have <div class=".step"></div> with nothing... the I load an .html file with ajax that will retrieve this:
[13:04:07] <shoky> class=".step" ?
[13:04:12] <yaazkal> <script language="JavaScript">
[13:04:13] <yaazkal>     new Image().src = "img/nurse_big.jpg";
[13:04:13] <yaazkal> </script>
[13:04:13] <yaazkal> <div class="descripcion">
[13:04:13] <yaazkal>     <p>Bla, bla, bla.</p>
[13:04:13] <yaazkal> </div>
[13:04:15] <yaazkal> <div class="imagen">
[13:04:17] <yaazkal>     <a href="img/nurse_big.jpg" class="zoom"> <img src="img/nurse.jpg" alt="Find the nurse" /> </a>
[13:04:19] <shoky> eh dont paste here
[13:04:19] <yaazkal> </div>
[13:04:33] <yaazkal> shoky, the code is in the stackoverflow
[13:04:39] <yaazkal> post
[13:05:08] <yaazkal> so take a look there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11180598/jquery-is-not-catching-click-on-some-content-loaded
[13:07:44] <shoky> and the 'step' div is static?
[13:08:08] <shoky> it's in the DOM already when you call $('.step').on('click', '.imagen', fn..) ?
[13:08:54] <yaazkal> yes, the .step is already in the DOM
[13:09:19] <fuchstronaut> re
[13:10:38] <yaazkal> shoky, if I use .on("click") it dosen't work in the .imagen div. But, If I use .on("mouseover") it works
[13:11:20] <yaazkal> that's the weird part
[13:12:01] <yaazkal> or "mousemove" it works
[13:12:26] <iwtu> hi. anybode here? :-)
[13:12:58] <min|dvir|us> I want to combine two sets of selected jQuery objects. Doable?
[13:13:21] <shoky> yaazkal the click is on the image
[13:13:48] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: see ?add
[13:13:49] <bot-t> min|dvir|us, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[13:14:00] <ajpiano> var foo = bar.add(baz);
[13:14:01] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, thanks. :)
[13:14:02] <shoky> yaazkal:  $("#arquitecta")  returns an empty set
[13:14:05] <iwtu> https://gist.github.com/2984720 I don't know why the $('#addBuoyButton').click(function() at the end.. is not execute when button is clisked
[13:14:11] <ajpiano> or if you want to augment an existing set, make sure to use an assigment
[13:14:14] <ajpiano> foo = foo.add(bar)
[13:14:21] <ajpiano> cause it doesn't modify the original reference
[13:14:25] <ajpiano> just fyi ;)
[13:14:30] <min|dvir|us> How do I get the empty jQuery collection?
[13:14:39] <ajpiano> $()
[13:14:51] <shoky> yaazkal:  $('.step').on('click', '.imagen img', fn...)
[13:15:05] <oojacoboo> I'm so sick of dealing with uploadify....
[13:15:11] <oojacoboo> anyone used this uploader?  https://github.com/valums/ajax-upload
[13:15:24] <oojacoboo> I saw it on Dwolla earlier this week, looks nice
[13:16:39] <yaazkal> shoky, dosen't work. Also tried with $('.step').on('click', '.imagen a', fn...) and even "div.imagen a" but nothing
[13:17:21] <fuchstronaut> (yaazkal): do you have a fiddle?
[13:18:37] <yaazkal> fuchstronaut, no. And I suppose that to have a fiddle I will have to paste the zoomy and the jmpress plugins, right ?
[13:19:08] <fuchstronaut> i don't know, I have not seen your code :-)
[13:19:45] <yaazkal> fuchstronaut, yes I guess I have to, that's why I've not created one
[13:19:57] <fuchstronaut> have you tried using delegate?
[13:21:00] <shoky> delegate just calls on
[13:21:22] <iwtu> someone, please.. :-(
[13:22:03] <oojacoboo> ?ask
[13:22:03] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:22:54] <fuchstronaut> right :)
[13:25:32] <shoky> yaazkal my guess is one of your plugins is stopping the propagation of the click event
[13:26:23] <shoky> yaazkal because  $(document).on('click', 'img', fn)  should work otherwise
[13:26:47] <yaazkal> shoky, seems that, I'm trying the answer of Esailija on StackOverflow... please let me try
[13:27:27] <shoky> ah, return false would do it :)
[13:28:02] <shoky> i like his last comment :)
[13:28:28] <shoky> don't use that plugin
[13:28:31] <min|dvir|us> Is there any way to save the current animation state?
[13:28:59] <min|dvir|us> I want to do $thing.fadeIn(); $thing.pause(); $thing.continue();
[13:29:07] <yaazkal> shoky, yes, it works now :) (using the solution of  Esailija). Big thanks for your time !
[13:29:16] <yaazkal> I'll post a comment and mark it as the answer
[13:29:18] <Whirl3d> shoky don't even mention it...it's not ready. LOL
[13:29:46] <Whirl3d> it's close, but not quite there.
[13:29:52] <shoky> min|dvir|us: Whirl3d is almost finished writing just the plugin for you
[13:29:57] <shoky> :D
[13:30:20] <shoky> np yaazkal
[13:31:40] <Whirl3d> min|dvir|us, I have been working on an animation plugin to manage animation states and provide a more granular syntax for animations. YOu could also look into the "animation" routine used by jquery core. It's different from the .animate method...James Padolsky has a great viewer for viewing the jquery code, Ill look it up.
[13:32:21] <Whirl3d> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.Animation
[13:32:33] <yaazkal> shoky, :) By now I will still use the plugin (I don't know another) and I will write to the developer. Thanks again :)
[13:34:27] <Whirl3d> another great animation plugin you might want to consider (which does allow pausing and state management) is jsTween. It's kind of old, but it works: http://jstween.blogspot.com/
[13:35:48] <gavimobile> imissmyjuno: im having a small jquery issue with my google map api v3
[13:36:17] <gavimobile> I think it's a jquery issue at least
[13:36:43] * yaazkal is happy
[13:37:02] <Whirl3d> and then one last animation reference that you might like is the upcoming 1.8 release of jquery. It has a new animation engine that looks pretty full-featured: https://gist.github.com/54829d408993526fe475
[13:44:28] <shoky> yay gnarf
[13:44:44] <oojacoboo> GOD I hate flash and uploadify
[13:45:05] <oojacoboo> https certificate doesn't match… throw random IO error with no debug info
[13:45:09] <oojacoboo> excellent idea!
[13:45:42] <andi> Hi
[13:47:11] <andi> I'm using jquery tabs and tinyscrollbar. When changing tabs I'm adjusting the size of the inner div according to the windows size. After adjusting size I'd like to relaod tinyscrollbar. Can somebody tell me if the select event of tabs is fired before or after the new tab is loaded?
[13:52:53] <shoky> andi it's fired before
[13:53:01] <shoky> the show event is fired after
[13:56:52] <andi> perfect, that works. Thanks shoky. ;)
[14:11:30] <sgp913> hi everyone, im a bit stumped on something javascript related. i have a script reading a json output and i want to make sure those variables are able to be used by other scripts. basically it's calling localization strings, and the localization script is not finding the variables. apparently the variables only exist in the script grabbing the json. is there a quick fix for this?
[14:13:42] <oojacoboo> sgp913, sounds like scope issues
[14:14:02] <oojacoboo> it also depends on how you're trying to access them and when
[14:15:25] <sgp913> http://pastebin.com/BFPu5E3d
[14:15:29] <sgp913> this is what i have now...
[14:15:51] <sgp913> then my localization script is just a bunch of $("span.i18n_67").html(i18n_t67);
[14:15:59] <alket> hi , how to : select onchange  > repopulate another select from mysql ?
[14:16:07] <sgp913> i mean t_67 i copy pasted wrong
[14:16:34] <sgp913> oojacoboo ^
[14:16:43] <oojacoboo> sgp913, I have no idea what you're trying to do and wouldn't even know where to start there
[14:16:48] <sgp913> then the localization function runs after that of course
[14:17:00] <sgp913> ok it's using services with drupal
[14:17:07] <oojacoboo> if you want to call functions to use variables from the json, you need to set those variables first
[14:17:09] <sgp913> i have all my strings as taxonomy in drupal
[14:17:11] <oojacoboo> or use calbacks
[14:17:19] <oojacoboo> callbacks*
[14:17:39] <oojacoboo> drupal has nothing to do with this
[14:18:23] <oojacoboo> I also have NO clue with taxonomy is
[14:18:24] <sgp913> that
[14:18:26] <sgp913> lol
[14:18:29] <oojacoboo> not that it matters
[14:18:38] <sgp913> thats what i thought the 'var' was for in the front
[14:18:46] <sgp913> a taxonomy is just a 'keyword' of sorts within drupal
[14:18:52] <oojacoboo> awesome?
[14:18:56] <sgp913> im using it to do multilingual
[14:18:59] <oojacoboo> I'm not a drupal fan
[14:19:02] <oojacoboo> ok
[14:19:09] <sgp913> that's probably because you just dont know how to use it properly
[14:19:10] <sgp913> haha
[14:19:14] <sgp913> drupal is AMAZING
[14:19:20] <sgp913> im building an iphone app in it now
[14:19:25] <oojacoboo> ...
[14:19:27] <sgp913> but javascript clearly is my weakness
[14:19:54] <systemfault> lol
[14:19:57] <sgp913> anyway, is "var" required before each statement?
[14:20:00] <systemfault> drupal is AMAZING
[14:20:02] <systemfault> !!1one
[14:20:07] <oojacoboo> systemfault, shhh
[14:20:15] <Nebukadneza> oh hell :( why are those connections randomly not working :(
[14:20:23] <Haprog> systemfault: var has nothing to do with statements..
[14:20:30] <Haprog> oops
[14:20:34] <Haprog> *sgp913
[14:21:05] <systemfault> var is to declare a "var"iable
[14:21:06] <Haprog> sgp913: var is for declaring variables local in the current scope
[14:21:11] <Nebukadneza> long-lived $.getJSON with a timeout of ~15s or so, server may return data or just let it turn out ... if i have many (~6 or more) of those connection open in one browser instance (firefox/chrome) some are "just not receiving data", without an error :(
[14:21:13] <sgp913> so then how do i get a variable set in a function to be available to other functions?
[14:21:18] <Nebukadneza> whhyyyy~ :(
[14:21:41] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, check your webserver?
[14:21:54] <oojacoboo> verify it's getting the requests
[14:21:58] <sgp913> im using this now eval("i18n_t" + obj.node.tid + "='" + obj.node.name + "';");
[14:21:58] <Nebukadneza> i've written my webserver myself in that case
[14:22:07] <sgp913> obj.node.tid and .name come from json
[14:22:08] <oojacoboo> well, likely the issue then
[14:22:10] <Nebukadneza> i does get all requests, it answers all of which it should answer
[14:22:15] <systemfault> lulz eval
[14:22:23] <sgp913> javascript noob, sorry
[14:22:24] <Nebukadneza> i've checked the sockets data with wireshark, there *is* data coming to the socket
[14:22:30] <sgp913> is there a better way
[14:22:40] <systemfault> sgp913: If you have a question… the answer is NEVER eval.
[14:22:44] <Nebukadneza> it gets lost somewhere in in/before firefox
[14:22:46] <sgp913> :-)
[14:22:54] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, it doesn't get lost
[14:23:06] <oojacoboo> unless your internet is intermittent
[14:23:12] <Nebukadneza> at least it doesn't make it into my complete-handler
[14:23:13] <Haprog> sgp913: you can declare the variable in some outer scope which includes the function within that scope. or declare a global variable.
[14:23:23] <Nebukadneza> i doubt the loopback interface CAN be lossy ;P
[14:23:32] <sgp913> what i want to do is create a variable i18n_t then the node id from json, then set the value to the name from json
[14:23:50] <Nebukadneza> fact is: i see outgoing data from the server, $.getJSONs complete() doesn't get it
[14:23:58] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, it's likely not the result of there being 6 but a couple of them being bad?
[14:24:17] <oojacoboo> have you tested each individually?
[14:24:21] <Nebukadneza> yes
[14:24:29] <oojacoboo> and they each work?>
[14:24:34] <Nebukadneza> it only occurrs when there are "many", one almost always works
[14:24:43] <sgp913> do you guys recommend a better way for the json results to dynamically create variables and set values that are available to all functions?
[14:24:52] <Nebukadneza> when there are multiple, most of them work, and some are just dead
[14:25:04] <Nebukadneza> (yes, i've raised all max_connection thingies in firefox...)
[14:25:12] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, does the xhr request continue to run?
[14:25:22] <Nebukadneza> oojacoboo: yes, it seems to run
[14:25:28] <oojacoboo> continue*
[14:25:33] <Nebukadneza> it just doesn't get the data and close from the server when it comes
[14:25:34] <oojacoboo> does it time out>?
[14:25:39] <Nebukadneza> it juts continus and times out
[14:25:40] <Nebukadneza> *just
[14:25:51] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, sounds like a server issue
[14:26:03] <Nebukadneza> as said, i've attached a wireshark, and there IS data
[14:26:05] <min|dvir|us> jQuery animation problem... http://jsfiddle.net/m3GJs/14/, enter the ID mentioned, skip to 0:40, and pause right when the cool comments start fading in (0:45). Then, when you resume, the comments will stay at partial opacity, even though fadeCommentIn is called again (you can see in the console). Any thoughts?
[14:26:19] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/m3GJs/15/
[14:26:19] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, your server is returning all 6+ requests?
[14:26:22] <min|dvir|us> Use that link instead.
[14:26:22] <oojacoboo> every single time?
[14:26:24] <Nebukadneza> yes
[14:26:25] <Nebukadneza> yes
[14:26:31] <Nebukadneza> definately
[14:26:37] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, did you check the headers on each of them?
[14:26:40] <Nebukadneza> yes
[14:26:54] <oojacoboo> I'd check the troll under the bridge then
[14:26:58] <Nebukadneza> wiresharks parser (although its no reference) finds it well-formatted each and every time (i do too)
[14:27:01] <Nebukadneza> lol :P
[14:27:26] <Nebukadneza> i tried looking under my bed *fg*
[14:27:29] <min|dvir|us> The JSfiddle is pretty cool, so even if you can't help, it's worth a look, I think. :)
[14:27:38] <Nebukadneza> there'd BE enough space for a troll
[14:28:39] <Nebukadneza> oojacoboo: i really don't know what to check anymore :(
[14:28:55] <oojacoboo> min|dvir|us, cool
[14:29:14] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, yea, I don't either, but something tells me you should start back from the beginning
[14:29:20] <oojacoboo> and double check everything I mentioned
[14:29:33] <min|dvir|us> oojacoboo, do you see the problem?
[14:29:34] <Nebukadneza> hm, so basically the server? :P
[14:29:58] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, the fact that you're using a custom server does tip me as a probable cause
[14:30:21] <Nebukadneza> hmm, i'm a little more sure that way actually, especially since i use many longlived connections, which would kill apache
[14:30:40] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, you can setup apache TTL
[14:30:45] <Nebukadneza> ttl?
[14:30:49] <oojacoboo> time to live
[14:31:11] <Nebukadneza> ah, yeah
[14:31:25] <Nebukadneza> but apache just doesn't play well with many connections
[14:31:54] <oojacoboo> the most popular web server in the world?
[14:31:59] <oojacoboo> we're talking about the same one?
[14:32:10] <Nebukadneza> yeees
[14:32:15] <oojacoboo> cool, just checking
[14:32:22] <Nebukadneza> its known not to handle many longlived connections well
[14:32:29] <Nebukadneza> its great for almost everything else though
[14:32:59] <oojacoboo> if you have connections that are living beyond a couple min, you should be handing these off to a job queue
[14:33:11] <min|dvir|us> Nebukadneza, Apache is good because it's widely-used and therefore widely supported. Other than that, I can't find a good reason to use it.
[14:33:13] <oojacoboo> so, that's certainly not a webserver issue and def more of a design flaw
[14:33:45] <oojacoboo> and many people would consider a couple min extreme
[14:33:55] <Nebukadneza> oh, i've seen hours used...
[14:34:05] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, that's stupid
[14:34:13] <Nebukadneza> works very well for google ;P
[14:34:14] <oojacoboo> absolutely stupid
[14:34:16] <oojacoboo> no
[14:34:20] <oojacoboo> it doesn't
[14:34:23] <Nebukadneza> C2DM push BoSH is like that
[14:34:30] <Nebukadneza> http timeuts of 3 hours
[14:34:31] <oojacoboo> I don't think so
[14:34:36] <Nebukadneza> do check ;P
[14:34:45] <Nebukadneza> they use jabber over http using bosh
[14:34:50] <oojacoboo> I don't think anything is establishing and HOLDING a conenction for that long
[14:35:23] <oojacoboo> the purpose of a webserver is to deliver data and move on
[14:35:27] <Nebukadneza> in this case its supported by the providers backbone, holding the http connection and sending gsm wakeup pings when datas there
[14:35:30] <oojacoboo> not sit and hold a connection for an hour
[14:35:42] <Nebukadneza> well, http can be used differently
[14:35:48] <Nebukadneza> it doesn't have to deliver web content too
[14:35:48] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, my guess is there is another socket listening
[14:36:02] <Nebukadneza> you mean for my problem? or for c2dm?
[14:36:09] <oojacoboo> c2whatever
[14:36:11] <oojacoboo> :)
[14:36:22] <Nebukadneza> k
[14:36:39] <Nebukadneza> well, as said, its opened and held from a cell providers backbone server
[14:36:44] <oojacoboo> but at any rate, you should be using a job queue
[14:36:47] <Nebukadneza> so it DOES hold and respond for s long
[14:36:54] <Nebukadneza> job quue on which side?
[14:37:01] <oojacoboo> server side of course
[14:37:03] <Nebukadneza> server is asyncore with queuing already
[14:37:20] <oojacoboo> then why wouldn't you just poll the server for the results?
[14:37:28] <oojacoboo> why would you hold the connection??
[14:37:36] <Nebukadneza> because only the server knows WHEN then updates happen
[14:37:44] <Nebukadneza> and the clients need to be notified instantly
[14:37:47] <oojacoboo> right, hence the polling
[14:37:49] <Nebukadneza> so they just open a connection, and wait
[14:37:54] <oojacoboo> or looking into some streaming delivery
[14:38:02] <Nebukadneza> so its non-busy polling
[14:38:24] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, and opens up a whole host of issues
[14:38:26] <Nebukadneza> or COMET as those web20 guys call it
[14:38:29] <oojacoboo> right
[14:38:38] <Nebukadneza> well, yeah ;/
[14:39:05] <oojacoboo> you also have meteor
[14:39:11] <Nebukadneza> the perl server?
[14:39:12] <Nebukadneza> never again
[14:39:14] <oojacoboo> yea
[14:39:15] <oojacoboo> ha
[14:39:17] <oojacoboo> I've never used it
[14:39:24] <Nebukadneza> it doesnt even support any friggin kind of authentication for FEEDING DATA
[14:39:36] <Nebukadneza> without hacking on it EVERYONE can just feed arbitrary data in there
[14:39:39] <Nebukadneza> what worth is that?
[14:39:41] <oojacoboo> I'm not talking about meteor the one Milk did
[14:39:41] <min|dvir|us> Why don't you use Socket.IO?
[14:39:44] <oojacoboo> or whomever
[14:39:57] <oojacoboo> but yea, meteor the perl server
[14:40:10] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, yep
[14:40:10] <Nebukadneza> min|dvir|us: as in websockets?
[14:40:12] <min|dvir|us> Or some other websocket wrapper, so you don't have to long poll?
[14:40:24] <Nebukadneza> hm, i'd like good support on all kinds of devices
[14:40:29] <Nebukadneza> and android and ios don't support websockets yet
[14:40:33] <min|dvir|us> Nebukadneza, that's what Socket.IO does.
[14:40:38] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, poll it at intervals
[14:40:41] <oojacoboo> problem solved
[14:40:43] <min|dvir|us> It's a fallback mechanism for realtime transport.
[14:40:52] <Nebukadneza> oojacoboo: won't be fast enough, increases server load *dramatically*
[14:41:03] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, what about the webserver overhead?
[14:41:09] <oojacoboo> how many instances are you supporting?
[14:41:10] <Nebukadneza> which?
[14:41:11] <lalle> what is index->products->televisions called? u know, that line wich tells you where you are on a page?
[14:41:14] <Nebukadneza> per connection state?
[14:41:17] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, right
[14:41:17] <Nebukadneza> minimal, few bytes
[14:41:24] <min|dvir|us> Many web browsers that support WS will use WS; those that don't will fall back to long polling or whatever other transports exist on the system.
[14:41:33] <oojacoboo> so you might have 1k server connections running?
[14:41:35] <oojacoboo> or more
[14:42:11] <Nebukadneza> min|dvir|us: where we'd just be at my current problem ;P
[14:42:41] <min|dvir|us> Nebukadneza, I guess I don't know what your current problem is, but using actual duplex is sure to make your performance increase.
[14:42:50] <systemfault> lalle: it's called Breadcrumb
[14:43:19] <oojacoboo> his problem is that he's using a love lived http server connection
[14:43:27] <oojacoboo> and somewhere, it's getting dropped
[14:43:35] <Nebukadneza> min|dvir|us: hm, thats a good point
[14:43:44] <oojacoboo> Nebukadneza, what happens when you user drops wifi?
[14:43:53] <oojacoboo> or their internet drops out
[14:44:02] <oojacoboo> mobile device on the go loses connectivity, etc
[14:44:15] <Nebukadneza> yes, but i can't do much then
[14:44:24] <Nebukadneza> just connect again as soon as the connections live again
[14:44:26] <oojacoboo> if you were polling, it'd still work
[14:44:43] <oojacoboo> you're backgrounding though… right?
[14:44:46] <oojacoboo> the actual job
[14:44:52] <Nebukadneza> well, at least on my android the socket gets reset when connectivity dis
[14:45:42] <Nebukadneza> s/the socket/the JS get request/
[14:45:42] <sonotos> moin Nebukadneza
[14:45:47] <Nebukadneza> oh, hi sonotos ;P
[14:46:19] <sonotos> searching for a comet server?
[14:46:26] <Nebukadneza> nopes
[14:46:28] <Nebukadneza> wrote one, works
[14:46:35] <sonotos> ahh :-)
[14:46:36] <Nebukadneza> just the clients exhibit undebuggable issues :(
[14:46:37] <Woet> i'm looking for a comet though, can you help me out?
[14:46:41] <sonotos> hrhr
[14:47:58] <sonotos> well normaly i propose node.js
[14:47:59] <Nebukadneza> Woet: sorry, i haven't even found one that met my needs :(
[14:48:07] <Nebukadneza> but i can recommend python asyncore and asynchat ;P
[14:48:40] <min|dvir|us> sonotos, Node.js is a JS runtime. Do you mean Socket.IO?
[14:49:24] <sonotos> min|dvir|us: node.js as server
[14:49:55] <min|dvir|us> Node.js doesn't itself deal with comet/realtime, though it has the mechanisms to perform such a task.
[14:50:36] <sonotos> min|dvir|us: well there should be a bunch of libs you can use to implement that
[14:50:44] <min|dvir|us> sonotos, like Socket.IO.
[14:50:50] <sonotos> min|dvir|us: correct
[15:00:26] <Nebukadneza> nachts um 12: "schau mal her ... es ist doch auch nur disassembly!"
[15:16:54] <J4M> I can't seem to get this to work: $('#bar').animate({right: -165});
[15:17:12] <J4M> is there an obvious syntax error there? thanks
[15:31:03] <Jon47> J4M: try '-165px'
[15:31:22] <Jon47> also, make sure the element is postioned either absolutely or relatively, or else the right property won't apply
[15:31:38] <J4M> hmm
[15:32:00] <J4M> It's a fixed bar, so I'm thinking. I was able to change it to right:0 though
[15:32:28] <J4M> I'm trying another method - to have jquery revert the style
[15:33:49] <ajustrun> hey guys, im trying to select the value field in the html element on line 9 in this gist https://gist.github.com/2985247
[15:33:56] <ajustrun> im trying $('#tagfield #tags').value but that isnt working, any ideas?
[15:34:05] <Murg|e> If I wanted to do some type of inline edit for a url link.  What would you all suggest as the best approach.  I dont want to have to edit html in the inline.  Just edit the actual url defined in href or the text between ></a>
[15:34:48] <ajustrun> Murg|e: just reassign the href value?
[15:35:01] <ajustrun> not sure what you mean by an inline edit
[15:36:54] <nFFF> ajustrun, why are you putting two ids as your selector
[15:37:07] <ajustrun> cause its a descendant of the first one?
[15:37:12] <ajustrun> not sure if thats correct
[15:37:58] <Murg|e> @ajustrum, http://70.68.155.133/mhl2 All the li are url links.  If you click on one, I'd like to edit the url and title but not see the raw html.
[15:38:25] <ajustrun> nFFF: is there a better way of doing it?
[15:39:07] <ajustrun> Murg|e: im no expert but make a .click that changes the values of title and href
[15:39:55] <ajustrun> also where are you hosting that?
[15:40:12] <Murg|e> Just a dev box.
[15:40:44] <ajustrun> where though?
[15:40:46] <ajustrun> on your computer?
[15:40:53] <Murg|e> Yea
[15:41:00] <ajustrun> how do you dot hat
[15:41:04] <ajustrun> (im a noob to web stuff)
[15:41:31] <Murg|e> Install a wamp package.
[15:41:37] <Murg|e> I personally use http://www.wampserver.com/en/
[15:41:51] <ajustrun> is it complicated?
[15:41:58] <ajustrun> oh also im on a mac
[15:42:13] <Murg|e> Ah, mac has a built in web server
[15:42:27] <Murg|e> You just need to turn it on.  Just google enable Mac web server or something like that.
[15:42:34] <ajustrun> thats so cool!
[15:45:34] <Whirl3d> does anybody know if the % operator works with - numbers? if I try console.log(-30%7) I get -2, but I am not sure if that's -(30%7) or not...Heck I don't even know for sure that -30%7  is not the same as -(30%7). Any advice?
[15:47:21] <Whirl3d> found it. It's called the modulus operator. Couldn't remember that to look it up for the life of me. nvm
[15:54:21] <nafg_> Whirl3d: You can use symbolhound.com
[15:56:11] <Whirl3d> nafg_, thanks I'll bookmark it for future reference. Never heard of symbolhound before.
[16:13:54] <ner0x> What a common file dialog multi-select that people are using now-a-days?
[16:14:05] <ner0x> Just need to be able to grab all the files in a dir and upload from there.
[16:21:32] <nafg_> ner0x: Have you seen valums?
[16:21:43] <nafg_> http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[16:24:22] <LoneStar99> onclick how would I place "cursor" in textbox?
[16:32:13] <Whirl3d> .focus()
[16:32:26] <ner0x> nafg_: That looks pretty nice.
[16:47:04] <Whirl3d> Just because I am drawing a blank at the moment: If I have a plugin that has an "eventList" property which is a list of event objects. Then inside each event object, I have a  $.Callbacks() object.  if ( cache the callbacks object and call it's add method (to add to the callbacks list), does it update the event object in my eventList or do I have to update it myself by this.eventList["someevent"].callbacks=cachedCallbacksVar?
[16:56:00] <Ilhami> hey...
[16:56:16] <Ilhami>  Hi I have an issue to be solved.  http://www.dirittimusulmani.it/ see this site.. click onthe white arrow in the red divtwice and see the login div is following it. how can I solve that?
[16:57:49] <johnline> nb: http://www.dirittimusulmani.it/wp-content/plugins/attentionGrabber_v1.5/js/attentionGrabber_js.php?ver=3.3.2 here is the file controlling this behaviour ^^
[16:57:53] <johnline> line 72
[17:21:47] <Whirl3d> if I have a handler bound to an event and I can trigger on that same event, how can I determine who triggered it so I don't get in an infinite loop?
[17:23:36] <Whirl3d> better yet...I want to setup a system whereby if one element fires an event another element's handler can handle it. But I want the same in reverse...element a. event a triggers a hanlder on element b   and element b event a triggers handler on element a...does that make sense or seem reasonable?
[17:55:07] <zamn> hey guys I'm trying to manipulate the following html: http://pastie.org/4145764 using jquery
[17:55:26] <zamn> basically im trying to make it so that when the user clicks on the artist link then the title div appears
[17:56:05] <zamn> so I have somehting like: $(".artist").click(function() { }); and im not usre how to say "check div to see if $(".title") is hidden"
[17:58:49] <kill-9_> check http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[18:02:42] <tomoyuki28jp> Is there a nice way or a framework to do MVC style development with jQuery?
[18:04:10] <coldhead> tomoyuki28jp: consider ember.js or backbone.js
[18:04:21] <coldhead> there are also many others
[18:04:29] <tomoyuki28jp> coldhead: will take a look at these. thanks a lot!
[18:04:45] <Hopsy> node.js!!
[18:05:01] <Hopsy> but that isnt a mvc I think?
[18:05:50] <coldhead> its not, Hopsy
[18:06:00] <coldhead> its a server side JS interpreter
[18:06:08] <coldhead> but you could run an MVC framework on it!
[18:09:42] <zamn> kill-9_: doesnt really help me
[18:11:57] <coldhead> zamn: it does, really
[18:12:23] <coldhead> if ($(".title").is(':hidden')) alert('HIDDEN')
[18:12:32] <zamn> thats not what i wanted
[18:12:37] <tomoyuki28jp> coldhead: ember.js or backbone.js, which one would you personally recommend?
[18:12:59] <coldhead> maybe you want the wrong thing, zamn
[18:13:27] <coldhead> tomoyuki28jp: i like backbone because it's small and i can get my head around it. ember is popular with rails people who like a lot of magic out of the box
[18:13:29] <coldhead> it's bigger
[18:13:35] <Hopsy> coldhead: where is Lua good for?
[18:13:43] <Hopsy> lua language
[18:13:51] <coldhead> games programming, apparently, Hopsy
[18:13:57] <tomoyuki28jp> coldhead: thanks a lot!
[18:14:06] <coldhead> and configuration files for bigger applications
[18:14:13] <zamn> coldhead: did you read what i said?
[18:14:15] <coldhead> my kid brother likes lua for games stuff
[18:15:01] <coldhead> zamn: "check div to see if $(".title") is hidden"
[18:15:12] <coldhead> if ($(".title").is(':hidden')) alert('HIDDEN')
[18:15:21] <coldhead> that seriously looks like what you were asking for, to me
[18:15:27] <Hopsy> lua is always opensource, it cant be compiled or something
[18:15:28] <coldhead> i am sorry, i'm very new to jQuery
[18:15:37] <coldhead> nonsense, Hopsy
[18:15:52] <Hopsy> hmm? why
[18:16:12] <zamn> coldhead: if i had that block 300 times
[18:16:14] <zamn> then how would you do it
[18:16:20] <zamn> thats what i meant to add
[18:16:39] <coldhead> can you show us the code you have so far, zamn?
[18:17:17] <coldhead> zamn: is there a title for each artist?
[18:17:28] <coldhead> is that what you're getting at?
[18:17:47] <coldhead> Hopsy: oh i see what you mean, you can compile the lua interpreter into other binary programs
[18:18:06] <coldhead> but you still supply the raw scripts that the interpreter uses
[18:18:09] <coldhead> uncompiled
[18:18:14] <coldhead> that's meant to be a Good Thing
[18:18:25] <coldhead> so the user can mess with the scripts
[18:18:40] <Hopsy> lol
[18:18:44] <Hopsy> verry good
[18:19:40] <Whirl3d> if I cache a collection of elements in a variable like var slides=$(".slide"); and then I want to get the first slide in the list, I would say var firstSlide=slides.first();   Does jquery search the dom for the firstSlide? or does it just search the cached collection (and therefore doesn't need to search the dom)
[18:21:06] <coldhead> zamn: http://jsfiddle.net/FV8QZ/ you trying to do something like this?
[18:21:41] <coldhead> it uses the cached stuff, Whirl3d
[18:21:47] <coldhead> you've already done the search
[18:22:27] <Whirl3d> so there's no significant cost in terms of time when using relative selectors on cached jquery objects...
[18:22:54] <coldhead> it depends on the selector
[18:23:09] <coldhead> first() is probably hella optimised to use [0] internally
[18:23:23] <coldhead> but if you're getting bottlenecked you can just use [0]
[18:23:30] <coldhead> and cut out the call to jQ
[18:24:23] <Whirl3d> naw, I've never gotten far enough to actually experience any bottlenecking. Though I have spent a great deal of time worrying about it. LOL
[18:25:28] <coldhead> ?optimization
[18:25:29] <bot-t> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[18:26:27] <innociv> Yeah don't worry about the traversing on a cached selector at all.
[18:29:08] <catcher> I'm building a site with responsive design - media queries are all good in css, but I need to animate a div by an amount depending on the media setting. Is there an equivalent available in js/jquery?
[18:29:28] <Whirl3d> item.siblings().first() will return the first element in the collection  that is not "item", right? So if item is the first in the collection, it wont return itself like item.parent().children().first() might?
[18:30:27] <coldhead> catcher: can you not animate via css?
[18:30:33] <coldhead> if that's where all is well?
[18:30:57] <catcher> coldhead, I have a feeling the answer is 'yes', but that would be news to me.
[18:31:30] <Hopsy> :( I am tireddd
[18:31:33] <catcher> coldhead, Basically something slides way left when a certain div is clicked. Is that doable in css?
[18:31:52] <coldhead> catcher: http://jsfiddle.net/FV8QZ/
[18:31:54] <coldhead> er
[18:31:58] <coldhead> wrong paste >: |
[18:32:03] <coldhead> catcher: http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/
[18:32:16] <coldhead> i'm only suggesting that because you're happy with modern css
[18:32:39] <coldhead> the jQuery way would probably be to get the width()/height()/offset() of the thng you care about
[18:32:44] <coldhead> and use those numbers in your animation
[18:33:04] <coldhead> ignoring the @media specifics and just going off what's actually occurring in the browser
[18:33:07] <Hopsy> its coldheads first day using jquery, and he already knows a lott!
[18:33:17] <catcher> coldhead, at this point, I'd like to stick with jquery only because it's already done & working for the most part.
[18:33:23] <Hopsy> anyway I am going to my beeddd
[18:33:35] <Hopsy> sleep tight all!
[18:33:45] <coldhead> catcher: cool, so you probably just want to keep it simple and use the numbers from the methods i mentioned
[18:33:49] <coldhead> goodnight Hopsy !
[18:34:01] <coldhead> catcher: without dragging @media specifics into your JS
[18:34:04] <Hopsy> y2! :D
[18:35:37] <catcher> coldhead, right now I'm shifting by a %, which is working well. I'm wanting to polish for iphone/ios, but the % vals aren't right after setting specific widths per media query.
[18:35:56] <coldhead> oh brother, that sounds tricky
[18:35:59] <catcher> after setting px-value widths instead of %, I mean.
[18:36:14] <coldhead> is setting %s an option?
[18:36:18] <catcher> coldhead, I had a feeling.. basically, I'd need to animate by different amounts depending on the device.
[18:36:24] <coldhead> even if you have to convert to %s with js
[18:37:18] <catcher> coldhead, ah, you're suggesting sticking with % in my queries, and just picking them better for my specific media queries?
[18:37:40] <catcher> coldhead, that makes sense, even if I'm misunderstanding you :)
[18:39:43] <coldhead> well you're taking my suggestion of "keep it simple and sexy" and applying it to your specifics
[18:39:48] <coldhead> that's fine <3
[18:44:28] <catcher> coldhead, the problem I need to solve is that I have a hide/show nav that covers 25% of the screen.  When I pinch-zoom some content on the page though, the nav gets huge and covers things up.
[18:44:55] <catcher> coldhead, I was hoping to set a specific max-width to handle that problem, but of course that won't work with px either. Any ideas?
[18:46:36] <coldhead> not without seeing a demo, catcher
[18:46:45] <coldhead> and even then, i don't have an iphone
[18:47:02] <coldhead> but someone here might be able to help once they see your issue live and loud!
[18:48:09] <catcher> haha
[18:49:04] <catcher> It's occurring to me that what I'm wanting is probably impossible from a physics standpoint. Unless I could shrink the percentage itself as zoom increases, which is silly and also impossible.
[18:50:01] <coldhead> can you maybe build your logic based on zoom level rather than pixel width?
[18:50:17] <coldhead> if (zoom > 2) $('#nav').hide() or something?
[18:50:25] <coldhead> i'm clearly not developing for mobile, huh
[18:50:46] <catcher> coldhead, that would only work for true browser zoom though, not mobile analog-style zoom, no?
[18:51:16] <coldhead> way out of my depth here, sorry buddy
[18:51:27] <coldhead> "they have internet on phones now?!"
[18:51:32] <catcher> I don't think pinch zoom is detectable. I could be wrong though, which would be awesome.
[18:51:33] <catcher> lol
[18:53:43] <catcher> what the f* is the internet?
[18:54:11] <coldhead> catcher: maybe try asking in #css
[18:54:18] <coldhead> those guys are way more into that stuff than us nerds
[18:56:12] <catcher> ty coldhead
[18:58:23] <Whirl3d> http://imgur.com/YgZvG
[18:59:14] <Whirl3d> given that screenshot, if you typed the closed bracket, would you expect it to read: addClass('current') or addClass('current)'  ?
[19:03:18] <kurol> the latter
[19:03:25] <Whirl3d> http://imgur.com/fB5xf is what you get. It adds the ) to the end of the string and places the insertion point just inside the brackets. I have some idiot at UltraEdit trying to convince me that that is expected behavior.
[19:04:33] <coldhead> that's too much magic
[19:10:51] * DinoDvornik hugs shoky!
[19:11:23] <coldhead> aw
[19:11:26] <bloof> what if you wanted a ) inside your string
[19:12:12] <coldhead> you'd have to use notepad
[19:38:33] <tash> I have several rows of things in a table that all have a checkbox, it's a loop essentially. So, the checkbox <td> has an id of "check-23" where the 23 comes from some php ... so each row is different, so I may have check-23, check-24, check-25 etc.  I'd like to know how to grab the id of the one I'm toggling and spit it out.  So, when I click on the checkbox, I want to grab its id ... and since there are several rows on the page with similar id's I can't do the 
[19:42:13] <tash> n/m that for now
[19:42:15] <tash> think i figured it out
[19:43:03] <coldhead> $(this).attr('id').split('-')[1]
[19:47:12] <tash> coldhead, thx
[19:47:22] <tash> got it with $(this).attr('id');
[19:47:26] <tash> I wanted the whole thing
[19:47:36] <ner0x> valums doesn't actually send a file to the server... Just a filename?
[19:48:07] <coldhead> you can't do ajax file uploads
[19:48:11] <coldhead> if that's what you're getting at
[19:48:22] <ner0x> I know that.
[19:48:31] <coldhead> oh good, now i know you know
[19:48:35] <coldhead> let's all take 5
[19:48:41] <ner0x> So why would valums say you can? I thought that was weird.
[19:49:14] <coldhead> that sounds like it's misconfigured
[19:49:25] <coldhead> or you're looking at the wrong thing on the serverside
[19:50:00] <ner0x> I'm looking at the server hit.
[19:50:04] <ner0x> It's not actually sending a file.
[19:50:09] <ner0x> Just a parameter via post.
[19:53:01] <coldhead> double check you're calling it right?
[19:53:05] <thomedy> iv got the most recent jquery and im using ben almans hashchange
[19:53:12] <coldhead> then i'd have a close look at the process with web inspector
[19:53:17] <coldhead> to see what's actually being transmitted
[19:53:28] <thomedy> but im getting a ($)function doesn't exist
[19:53:41] <thomedy> 	  })(jQuery,this);
[19:53:45] <thomedy> not defined
[19:54:35] <ner0x> coldhead: turned the debug and looked at the hit from chromes inspector. Good send, only sending a query string parameter.
[19:54:59] <coldhead> ?p @ thomedy
[19:54:59] <bot-t> thomedy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[19:56:08] <ner0x> coldhead: I believe I need to send the enctype="multipart/form-data" in order for it to be recognized by my server.
[19:56:08] <coldhead> ner0x: the project has 121 open issues on github... i'd try a different lib https://github.com/valums/file-uploader/issues
[19:56:15] <thomedy>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    i havent done anything yet i have in cluded benalmans hashchange and jquery 1.72
[19:56:29] <thomedy> oh sorri didn't realize the space return there
[19:56:33] <coldhead> thomedy: did you include jQuery first?
[19:56:40] <thomedy> oh crap of course
[19:56:41] <ner0x> coldhead: uploadify seems promising but uses flash. I assume most places have flash now-a-days.
[19:56:41] <thomedy> thank you
[19:56:43] <thomedy> im a bit tired
[19:56:48] <thomedy> cuz i worked both my jobs today
[19:56:52] <thomedy> thank for that simple fix
[19:57:21] <coldhead> ner0x: lots of people are happy with https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[19:57:23] <thomedy> all better
[19:57:27] <coldhead> it uses flash if it needs to
[19:57:33] <coldhead> but a bunch of other fallbacks first
[19:57:53] <ner0x> coldhead: Oh, that looks very nice.
[19:57:57] <ner0x> I'll take a look at it. Thank you sir.
[19:58:02] <ner0x> coldhead++ # being helpful
[19:58:04] <thomedy> im learning how to write my own using window.onUnload or has anyone used it yet
[19:58:07] <thomedy> hash change
[19:58:54] <coldhead> i've only used other people's, thomedy, like the router in backbone.js
[19:59:33] <thomedy> i was planning on writing my own using <body onUnload='function()'
[19:59:44] <thomedy> but im just going to use the plugin for now
[20:01:08] <coldhead> onunload is kinda painful
[20:01:13] <coldhead> with the timelimits and such
[20:02:02] <ner0x> coldhead: Only question, does it rely on the multiple="multiple" HTML5 for the <input> ?
[20:02:23] <coldhead> i'm not sure, i am sorry
[20:03:40] <Whirl3d> coldhead, would you mind looking at a plugin I just tried to write. I am missing something. I pasted the code in a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/yfkxu/30/, and the implementation is at  http://www.paigeharvey.net/gallery/main-6.html
[20:03:50] <thomedy> yeah im super tired im just going to use the plugin... but i need to know js straight so ican write my own plugins
[20:04:18] <ner0x> coldhead: No problem. I'll hit the docs/code.
[20:07:35] <coldhead> Whirl3d: so it's upset about the "new" call
[20:08:30] <Whirl3d> are you asking? or telling me. I am never sure how to implement it. Where do I put new controller
[20:08:56] <tash> if the id of something is blah ... and its a checkbox, how can I check to see if it is checked?   I tried: if ( $( "#blah" ).checked == true ) { console.log( "checked"); } but that ends up being false
[20:08:59] <coldhead> i am pretty rusty on this stuff, Whirl3d
[20:09:06] <coldhead> it's my first day, pretty much
[20:09:17] <coldhead> i'm not sure new works in this context
[20:09:50] <coldhead> i'm not sure the rest of your code supports new at this point
[20:09:57] <coldhead> it may well though, don't listen to me
[20:10:03] <coldhead> i haven't used new in like 5 years
[20:10:38] <Whirl3d> hmm. well thank you for looking. I'll start with "new" and see what I can figure out from there.
[20:10:43] <tash> n/m me
[20:10:44] <tash> got it
[20:10:52] <coldhead> Whirl3d: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new
[20:11:06] <coldhead> if you look at the examples, new is expecting a function, not an object
[20:11:14] <coldhead> and controller seems to be an object
[20:11:54] <Whirl3d> $.extend(controller.prototype, duh!
[20:12:24] <coldhead> you are way past my level here Whirl3d :)
[20:12:40] <coldhead> i seriously should learn javascript some day
[20:13:17] <Whirl3d> you were right about the new thing. Now that I have extended the prototype, I'm at least into the init func. Yay! Thanks.
[20:14:10] <coldhead> my debugger was right about the new thing :P
[20:17:29] <thomedy> i think i need a short nap nothing in my head is running
[20:18:27] <tash> what's the best way to get YYYY-MM-DD from Date(); ?
[20:18:46] <tash> so, var now = new Date(); // want that in 2012-06-24 format for example.
[20:22:30] <Whirl3d> is it possible to store an object in an element's data-prefixed attribute or do you have to use it's data-object?
[20:22:50] <coldhead> tash: i would use http://momentjs.com/
[20:23:00] <coldhead> because dates suck so hard in native js
[20:23:28] <coldhead> and i anticipate your wailing about having to use another library by suggesting you just copy the function you need :D
[20:25:00] <coldhead> works for me, Whirl3d http://jsfiddle.net/gZWjt/
[20:28:00] <Whirl3d> weird, when i set the data-conroller attribute with $(elem).attr("data-controller', this) it diddn't work. But $("elem").data('controller" works...
[20:28:25] <coldhead> oh i think maybe data- attrs get removed
[20:28:34] <coldhead> when jQuery processes them
[20:28:42] <coldhead> they get "moved" to .data()
[20:28:56] <coldhead> what is up with .attr(..., this) though
[20:29:04] <coldhead> i don't understand any of your code anymore, Whirl3d
[20:29:09] <coldhead> you're doing next level shit
[20:29:46] <Whirl3d> attr(data-something)    stores it on the element ....data doesn't
[20:30:01] <Whirl3d> data is only available as a convenience via jquery.
[20:30:49] <Whirl3d> so elem.attr("data-nose","picker") will give you elem.data("nose")=="picker"   but
[20:31:12] <Whirl3d> elem.data('nose', 'picker');   does not give you elem.attr('data-nose')=="picker"
[20:31:22] <someprimetime> ajpiano: you around?
[20:31:34] <coldhead> he's retired for the evening, someprimetime
[20:31:48] <someprimetime> coldhead: are you going to jquery con next weekend?
[20:31:48] <coldhead> Whirl3d: that's the kind of distinction i'd prefer not to be aware of
[20:31:53] <coldhead> i am not, someprimetime
[20:31:56] <coldhead> its very sad
[20:32:07] <someprimetime> bummer. wish there were tix still available
[20:33:41] <coldhead> you can probably hang out in the parking lot and hope someone pities you, someprimetime
[20:33:50] <coldhead> might be some no shows
[20:34:09] <someprimetime> coldhead: i work down the block so i don't think that's necessary
[20:34:23] <someprimetime> they've got to have more tickets though i feel like they're hoarding
[20:34:40] <coldhead> bastards!
[20:34:58] <coldhead> don't call them bastards though, it probably doesn't help your case
[20:35:51] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, you work in SF?
[20:35:59] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: yeah SOMA area
[20:36:08] <Whirl3d> You ever go to the EndUp?
[20:36:14] <someprimetime> haha i went there a couple weeks ago
[20:36:23] <Whirl3d> My favorite place on the planet
[20:36:26] <someprimetime> i wanted to drink but unfortunately they stop serving
[20:36:37] <coldhead> you
[20:36:43] <coldhead> 're in SF too Whirl3d ?
[20:36:45] <someprimetime> there is a really good speakeasy (or there was until they put it on hold) live jazz, bar on the 2nd level, beds on the top level
[20:36:50] <Whirl3d> I lived in SF for about 6 years.
[20:36:52] <someprimetime> it was on the corner of 7th and mission
[20:36:57] <coldhead> ah, those were the days
[20:37:20] <Whirl3d> of which I was in line to get into the endup every sunday mormning at 6am. God I loved that club.
[20:37:22] <someprimetime> i live in oakland (or did until my apt. burned on memorial day)\
[20:37:32] <someprimetime> staying in the city with a friend until we move back to rockridge area in oakland
[20:37:35] <Whirl3d> Man, sorry to hear about that
[20:37:42] <someprimetime> it's no worries, i had renter's insurance
[20:37:44] <someprimetime> i recommend getting it
[20:38:09] <someprimetime> yo Whirl3d you work in SOMA area?
[20:38:26] <Whirl3d> I wish. I moved to Atlanta around 1996...8(
[20:38:38] <someprimetime> ah i was in GA this past summer
[20:38:49] <someprimetime> up in roswell / alpharetta / woodstock
[20:38:50] <Whirl3d> it was HOT, i bet.
[20:38:58] <someprimetime> but we went to identity festival in ATL
[20:39:08] <someprimetime> yeah i'm not used to that humidity.
[20:39:23] <Whirl3d> hate it. Miss S.F. so much.
[20:39:54] <coldhead> you should go back!
[20:40:01] <coldhead> who goes to GA anyway?
[20:40:18] <Whirl3d> Good luck getting into the conference. I'll be rootin' for ya. I gotta steak on the grill waitin for me. 8)
[20:40:25] <Whirl3d> followed a love interest.
[20:40:26] <Whirl3d> lol
[20:40:34] <Whirl3d> bbl
[20:41:25] * coldhead faps
[20:41:29] <Haprog> wish we had jQuery events here in Finland
[20:42:09] <coldhead> you should organise one!
[20:42:12] <coldhead> that's all it takes
[20:42:25] <Haprog> :)
[20:42:27] <Haprog> maybe some day
[20:47:00] <Jeff_D> hey, guys, feeling like a n00b again, but having mental vapourlock on http://jsfiddle.net/593KT/
[20:47:41] <Jeff_D> a paragraph has two <a> elements in it with different classes, but when I try to select using one of the classes, I get both <a> elements back
[20:47:58] <tash> on a change event I'm executing some php code to get the server's current date and throwing it in a conole.log().  However, it keeps coming out as 1982!  console.log ( <?php echo date("Y-m-d"); ?> );  When I run that code alone in a php file it returns 2012-06-24.  Why the weird date of 1982 in my console.log ?
[20:48:40] <Jeff_D> 2012 - 6 - 24 = 1982
[20:49:10] <Jeff_D> your JS is evaluating that string as if it were an arithmetic expression
[20:49:27] <tw2113> that one time when you alter a jQuery plugin because it has obnoxious z-index values
[20:49:37] <tash> Jeff_D, interesting
[20:49:47] <tash> so I need to escape them I take it
[20:50:30] <Jeff_D> tash: yeah, or otherwise make sure you're not passing that to any code that's expecting to be able to evaluate an expression, because that's what you're getting
[20:51:41] <tash> console.log( <?php $time = time(); echo date("Y\-m\-d", $time);?> );
[20:51:49] <tash> those escape slashes don't work
[20:52:07] <tash> my code is a little overkill actually
[20:52:24] <Jeff_D> that's your first problem :)
[20:52:46] <tash> console.log( <?php $date("Y-m-d"); ?>  );
[20:52:52] <tash> that is what I originally was trying
[20:53:04] <tash> but I can't seem to escape the dashes
[20:53:55] <Jeff_D> you're running this via your browser-loaded JavaScript or some back end like node or backbone?
[20:54:05] <tash> browser
[20:54:20] <trollboy> I'm using $.ajax({...}).done(...);  is there a way I can throw a function on it loading as well?
[20:54:47] <Jeff_D> so you've got JS running in the browser and PHP running on your server, and you're having the JS write output to the browser that includes PHP tags… what's wrong with this picture?
[20:55:49] <Jeff_D> the console that JS writes to isn't the Web server console, you know
[20:56:18] <tash> yeah, let me re-think this
[20:56:49] <Jeff_D> Good. and good luck. No harm done :)
[20:56:56] <Jeff_D> it's Monday here, too
[20:57:35] <Jeff_D> unfortunately, I can't blame my facepalm on Monday, because I've been cracking my head since Saturday
[20:58:19] <tash> :)
[20:59:28] <Jeff_D> again, guys, http://jsfiddle.net/593KT/ — a paragraph includes two anchor tag pairs, with different combinations of classes; using  $('.class1') or $('#test1').children().select('class1'); (where class1 and class2 differentiate the two anchor pairs) gives me back the entire paragraph. Why?
[21:00:35] <Jeff_D> or, rather, seems to give me back both anchor pairs - one with 'class1' and the other with 'class2', even though I only asked for 'class1'
[21:00:59] <coldhead> your code has simple_test and your html has simple-test
[21:01:07] <coldhead> also they have no content
[21:01:22] <coldhead> and this doesn't do what you think it does http://api.jquery.com/select/
[21:01:43] <coldhead> why not $('#thing').find('a.simple_test') instead of .children().filter()
[21:01:49] <coldhead> which is what you probably meant
[21:02:15] <Jeff_D> right. thanks. sometimes you get too close to see anything :P
[21:02:25] <coldhead> oh man, i hear that
[21:02:50] <coldhead> it's like a woman's love
[21:08:26] <Jeff_D> coldhead: thanks. as soon as I scrape the henhouse (with lots of egg) off my face, I'm back to making (forward) progress :P
[21:38:22] <Whirl3d> so I have a library that includes animation properties including a callback. I extend my prototype function with this library, but I don't know how to reference the controller inside a callback. any suggestions?
[21:51:06] <innociv> You probably need to pass callback(this);
[21:51:28] <coldhead> controller is kind of a loaded term
[21:51:31] <Whirl3d> this is the animated element, however
[21:52:12] <Whirl3d> and I thought I could do $(this).parent().data("controller'").registerCurrent($(this)); but nooo
[21:52:42] <someprimetime> man i'm so ungry
[21:52:43] <someprimetime> hungry
[21:53:28] <Whirl3d> so then I bound a registerCurrent event to the parent element and a handler on the controller so that in the callback, I could say $(elem).parent().trigger("registerCurrent", $(this))
[21:56:02] <trollboy> I'm trying to make a semi transparent "loading" div over my content area.. I've set it with a higher z-index than my content div and use .hide() on it and .show().. its not showing up though and appears to be behind the content
[21:56:55] <coldhead> live demo, trollboy ?
[21:57:04] <coldhead> it works fine in my imagination
[22:06:53] <trollboy> sorry didn't see your reply, you still there coldhead
[22:08:08] <Whirl3d> so no data can be passed with .proxy? then it's more like crippledProxy isn't it? Why use proxy when you could use apply and pass data?
[22:12:03] <coldhead> because proxy has a cooler name?
[22:12:30] <coldhead> if two guys were vying for my attention, and one used and apply and the other used proxy, i know which one i'd go home with
[22:12:45] <coldhead> THE ONE WITH THE PLATINUM AMEX AMIRITE LADIES
[22:14:27] <Whirl3d> amex black or lump it...that's what I tell 'em
[22:17:41] <coldhead> sup gavin
[22:39:29] <coldhead> WHO CALLED, AND WHAT THE HELL DID THEY SAY
[22:39:38] <abjorn> I called
[22:39:39] <abjorn> and I said

[23:43:56] <mink> Hello :) Maybe anyone know how stop 'execute hover function' many time? I mean If user wave mouse a lot, it's executed 100 times
[23:44:29] <coldhead> ?stop @ mink
[23:44:30] <bot-t> mink, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[23:44:52] <Cork> mink: or if you want it to just run once at a time, set a variable and unset it when your done
[23:45:39] <mink> Thanks  (:
[23:48:03] <fRAiLtY-> whirled was helping me Friday but I've lost the fiddle he sent me :x http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing if you select drop-down 1 it highlights a row, drop-down selects a column and shows the price. drop-down 3 refreshes the table with new data, but loses the highlights, how can I re-apply the highlights after the ajax ?
[23:49:41] <coldhead> fRAiLtY-: http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/
[23:49:45] <coldhead> you can find it in the logs!
[23:51:46] <varnie> Hi.
[23:52:42] <coldhead> hey varnsy
[23:52:46] <varnie> I have a rather simple question: whether the following code correct? "var foo = $('input[name="bar"]'); if (foo && foo.val() != undefined) {alert(1);} "  ?
[23:53:00] <varnie> is the condition correct there?
[23:53:29] <varnie> varnsy..umm, okay,I'll be varnsy today;)
[23:54:13] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/g58J6/8/ gah I'm still confused
[23:54:22] <coldhead> the foo in if (foo will always return true
[23:54:40] <fRAiLtY-> Do I need to store the highlight action in a variable or smt?
[23:54:41] <coldhead> because $('something_that_doesnot_exist') returns an empty jQuery object
[23:54:45] <coldhead> which is still true
[23:55:01] <coldhead> so you can just use if (foo.val()..)
[23:55:14] <varnie> yeah, that was my guess. thanks, coldhead!
[23:55:52] <coldhead> Whirl3d: wanna revisit your assistance from last week?
[23:59:12] <juha_> varnie: you could also check foo.length, there is multiple ways of checking if your selector is valid
[23:59:49] <coldhead> var valid = confirm('Did the selector seem to work, dear user?')
