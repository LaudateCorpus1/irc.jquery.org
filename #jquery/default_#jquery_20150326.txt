[00:58:31] * DaFiN is scared of chat channels
[01:02:35] <IamTrying> I have this but its always failing to install the Plugin even the url is correct. e.g: function installExtension() { chrome.webstore.install('https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jQuery-kiosk/appid', success, fail); }
[01:02:52] <IamTrying> its always going to the fail callback.
[01:02:58] <Cork> IamTrying: wrong channel
[01:03:15] <Cork> you should ask that in a chrome extension development channel
[01:03:20] <IamTrying> OK -  Cork thank you
[01:21:24] <lilsammy> Anyone use Datatables.net much?
[01:27:59] <grandfatha> Programmatically building a jqm listview with links to another internal page. The links dont work, they only do if the listview has its link already in the dom on load, how can i dynamically add a listview of links?
[01:35:48] <runtyrobot> I'm trying to perform an action, whenever wordpress uploads a file. It does an async upload via POST to a particular url - is it possible to trigger on that event?
[01:40:42] <m_e> is it somehow possible to do this in jquery: $(this).each("option:selected", function(i, v) { ...
[01:41:12] <Cork> m_e: you need .find
[01:41:32] <m_e> Cork: but wouldn't find give me only 1 element?
[01:41:39] <Cork> no
[01:41:42] <m_e> i thought it just gives me the first element it found
[01:41:46] <m_e> ah ok nice gonna try that
[01:53:19] <m_e> damn doesnt work for some reason
[01:57:58] <dimi1947> could I make here a question related to vanilla js...it is something that might be able to be solved with jquery too
[01:59:16] <Cork> dimi1947: normally you should take vanilla questions to ##javascript
[01:59:22] <m_e> Cork: oh man... my fault... its working! thank you!
[01:59:26] <Cork> but ya, it is normalyl ok to ask here too
[02:00:15] <dimi1947> is this another irc channel?
[02:00:21] <Cork> ya
[02:00:29] <Cork> note the two ##
[02:00:34] <dimi1947> ok thanks....I will go first there
[02:03:44] <Omar-> good morning
[02:06:35] <Uhkis> i just made my first jquery plugin, anyone wanna test/review it?
[02:07:42] <Uhkis> http://uhkis.github.io/floatforms/
[02:08:27] <deepy> Uhkis: that is pretty cool
[02:09:00] <Lebbe> not bad ukhis
[02:09:11] <deepy> Uhkis: you should point it to httpbin though
[02:09:16] <Lebbe> should have some kind of validation, for instance if email addresses arent equal
[02:09:27] <guzzlefry> Is anyone using the jquery-file-upload plugin? The basic version without the UI. I can't for the life of me figure out how to limit the queue to a single file, and also clear it once uploaded.
[02:09:31] <Lebbe> shouldnt pop into the blue box on validation error :)
[02:10:04] <Lebbe> and should be more apparent that the fields in the blue box are editable, a pencil icon or something?
[02:10:11] <Lebbe> but great work uk
[02:10:13] <Lebbe> Uhkis:
[02:10:15] <Lebbe> :)
[02:10:27] <Uhkis> deepy: httpbin?
[02:10:40] <deepy> Yeah, make the form post to http://httpbin.org/post
[02:10:59] <deepy> in the demo
[02:11:11] <Uhkis> Lebbe: ill add that to todo-list
[02:12:11] <Lebbe> I can report them on issues on github if you like, so the plugin looks more active
[02:13:13] <Lebbe> validation support at least. the part about input items in blue-box are editable is a styling issues left to the designer perhaps
[02:13:19] <Uhkis> Lebbe: it's less then 4 hours old :)
[02:13:25] <Uhkis> *than
[02:14:02] <Lebbe> nice work
[02:15:39] <Uhkis> deepy: now it posts there, nice tool
[02:18:23] <Omar-> well done Uhkis
[02:24:16] <rominronin> hey
[02:24:25] <runtyrobot> HARRO
[02:24:33] <Omar-> hey
[02:24:51] <rominronin> does anyone know of any web design/development courses at university (Batchelor) level that I can study from home?
[02:26:01] <deepy> rominronin: what's your goal?
[02:26:05] <deepy> points or learning?
[02:27:17] <rominronin> getting a job in Vienna - Employers here value training more than experience (wasn’t the case in London), so being self-taught I’m having difficulty finding work
[02:28:42] <rominronin> My german isn’t yet good enough to access the local universities, so I’m looking for distance learning alternatives.
[02:28:51] <Uhkis> wow
[02:29:07] <rominronin> indeed
[02:29:17] <Uhkis> training over expertise makes no sense what so ever
[02:29:30] <Cork> ya
[02:35:40] <Lebbe> vienna is more infested with HR than london then
[02:36:09] <Xatenev> Heya
[02:36:11] <Xatenev> fast question
[02:36:50] <Xatenev> inside my ajax call, i have getCompanySession: true
[02:36:59] <Xatenev> is it somehow possible to pass it as a boolean instead of a string?
[02:37:03] <Xatenev> probably not right?
[02:37:17] <Lebbe> rominronin: i bet you have found sites like this on google allready? http://www.webdesigndegreecenter.org/affordable/web-design-schools-online/
[03:37:44] <varrg> http://jsfiddle.net/8fcp3f8s/ look at this madness. (click the leaves)
[03:38:08] <varrg> it's caused because -webkit-transform: translate() is being overridden
[03:38:23] <varrg> ping Cork & Omar-
[03:38:42] <midori-rus> hello there
[03:39:28] <Omar-> hi varrg
[03:39:45] <varrg> I've removed the third party plugin, and using more CSS
[03:40:02] <midori-rus> http://jsfiddle.net/symbios_zi/xf076zyd/ I am wanned to check if selected option became 0. But, it is doesn't works
[03:40:07] <varrg> thew "growing" animates looks cool now, with the leaf-specific coordinates and transforms
[03:40:20] <varrg> the*
[03:40:27] <midori-rus> Cork hello man. Doy you have one minute for me?
[03:41:05] <Omar-> varrg maybe using css transition is better than .animate()
[03:41:26] <Omar-> let me see first what's causing misplacing leaves before animation begins
[03:41:52] <varrg> I tried that aswell, but couldn't get it to work
[03:42:41] <varrg> Omar-, except for the misplacement at the start, the "falling animation" looks cool, with the translat()ing, but it won't matter. it can fall straight as well, as long as it rotates
[03:42:55] <varrg> but as it does now, looks more natural with wind and such
[03:43:39] <midori-rus> is it possible to check if all option become unchecked?
[03:45:38] <varrg> midori-rus, you'll up your changes if you paste a fiddle that actually runs
[03:45:45] <varrg> ie. a working example
[03:45:54] <varrg> chances*. God, what's with my English today
[03:47:43] <midori-rus> varrg I
[03:47:51] <midori-rus> I've found my mistake.
[03:48:14] <midori-rus> varrg is it possible to get selected by this?
[03:48:35] <midori-rus> $("#mySelect :selected").length; ===> $(this +":selected").length;
[03:48:38] <midori-rus> like this?
[03:48:51] <kokut> Hello, I need to create a div and attach it to the bottom of the screen
[03:48:54] <kokut> how can i do that?
[03:49:21] <varrg> midori-rus, no, this is an object. rather: $("#mySelect:selected")
[03:49:37] <Uhkis> kokut: css, position: fixed;
[03:49:57] <varrg> #mySelect :selected => #mySelect *:selected <- IE. any child element wijth :selected'
[03:50:26] <midori-rus> varrg I wanned to make a plugin without any classes and IDs
[03:50:42] <midori-rus> I cant understand how to use 'this' for select
[03:51:05] <kokut> Uhkis: yea i know but how do i create/attach the div
[03:51:33] <midori-rus> varrg this works fine console.log($("#mySelect :selected").length);
[03:51:40] <midori-rus> but i want to use this :(
[03:52:14] <midori-rus> this.find(":selected") doesnt work too
[03:52:18] <Uhkis> kokut: $('body').append($('<div>').attr('id', 'floater')); or something like that
[03:55:52] <Omar-> varrg the problem I assume is within var (now)
[03:56:01] <Omar-> you should start from last rotation
[03:56:07] <Omar-> i'm trying to fix it
[03:56:59] <frank_o> Sup guys
[03:57:31] <varrg> Omar-, okay. meanwhile I made some progress in css transition: http://jsfiddle.net/u7mx6gcr/1/
[03:58:05] <varrg> Omar-, I'm setting css.top with jquery because 100% is within #twig, not body, so I can't set a dynamic value with css
[03:58:47] <Uhkis> browser prefixes should be illegal
[03:59:23] <frank_o> yeah :/
[03:59:28] <frank_o> https://github.com/imsky/cssFx is cool though?
[03:59:49] <frank_o> sets browser prefixes so i dont have to worry about them
[03:59:53] <varrg> Uhkis, yea, I can be bothered to prefix other vendors in this early stage
[04:00:45] <frank_o> I'm trying to use ajax to check every 5 seconds if content on my server has changed since the user loaded it. I understand I must use advanced HTTP caching to make sure my server isn't hammered down to the ground because of this.
[04:00:49] <frank_o> My server is set up to return the `Last-Modified` HTTP header, including `302 Not Modified` if that is the case. I've set `ifModified: true`, as well as `If-Modified-Since` in `beforeSend` to the value of `Last-Modified`.
[04:00:53] <frank_o> But I'm having trouble understanding how all this fits together. Other than setting `If-Modified-Since`, where am I supposed to actually use it? Do I need to check for change inside `success`?
[04:00:57] <frank_o> Please see: https://gist.github.com/dt1973/fc7a3abb354457946fc8 -- not sure how to recreate this inside a fiddle, but I do have links to the Rails app on GitHub plus a live Runnable.com test case of it.
[04:04:26] <kokut> Uhkis: ty
[04:06:02] <varrg> Omar-, http://jsfiddle.net/u7mx6gcr/2/ looks good now.  EXCEPT it falls really fast the first 200 milliseconds. I wonder why
[04:09:09] <aro> rochadt: are you there?
[04:09:49] <frank_o> varrg: `ease` maybe?
[04:10:14] <varrg> frank_o, still looks odd
[04:11:11] <varrg> frank_o, oh, ease-in on top, looks good  though
[04:12:43] <Omar-> varrg sorry, I was trying to fix your first demo
[04:13:03] <Omar-> you can control spead of transition since you're using CSS
[04:13:06] <varrg> Omar-, np. I think I will leave animate(), and go with my latest fiddle
[04:13:19] <varrg> yeah, I like this http://jsfiddle.net/u7mx6gcr/3/
[04:13:38] <varrg> I'll probably play around with duration and timing-function to perfect it
[04:29:57] <giuseppesolinas> hello
[04:31:54] <giuseppesolinas> can someone answer this: I am binding a fuction like this: $(document).on('click', '.mydiv', function() {...}). I have all wrapped un in a function that I call to initialize my scripts when new content is loaded. If I call the 'main' function twice the 'click' function gets executed twice per click.
[04:32:04] <giuseppesolinas> how do I prevent this?
[04:32:25] <Xatenev> giuseppesolinas: .one?
[04:32:40] <Xatenev> I dont rly understand ur whole question but it sounds like ur searching for .one instead of .on
[04:32:49] <giuseppesolinas> Xatenev, I tried, but I need my function to get executed more than once
[04:33:13] <giuseppesolinas> if I use .one it works only the first time I click
[04:33:24] <giuseppesolinas> I need it to work everytime I click
[04:33:29] <Xatenev> ah i get u
[04:33:40] <giuseppesolinas> but it must execute once
[04:33:56] <Xatenev> hm
[04:33:56] <giuseppesolinas> not twice
[04:33:56] <Xatenev> mnaybe just unbind and bind again?
[04:34:07] <varrg> Omar-, next problem: http://jsfiddle.net/u7mx6gcr/6/ look how the translate() is not applied when it grows out again (after transition ends)
[04:34:19] <Xatenev> like $(urObj).off('click').on('click', yourFunction);
[04:34:25] <varrg> Omar-, checking what $.css(webkitTransform) contains, it contains a matrix()
[04:34:27] <giuseppesolinas> how do I unbind and re-bind if i bind with $(document).on() ?
[04:34:35] <Xatenev> giuseppesolinas: just .off
[04:34:45] <Xatenev> and .on again then
[04:34:58] <Xatenev> dont know if that is the best solution tho
[04:35:04] <giuseppesolinas> Xatenev,  tried, but if I do so every event bound on $(document) gets unbound
[04:35:34] <giuseppesolinas> and I use it everytime because I need to bind on new content I load
[04:35:46] <Xatenev> hm
[04:35:48] <varrg> giuseppesolinas, toggle a boolean variable
[04:35:55] <Xatenev> ye just thought about this aswell
[04:36:23] <varrg> var event_added;$fn= function(){ if (!event_added) { $(document).on(...); event_added = true; }
[04:36:24] <Xatenev> like if(EventNotBoundYet) {bind Event}
[04:36:29] <Xatenev> ya
[04:37:58] <giuseppesolinas> varrg, I'll try, they calling me now, lame
[04:38:00] <giuseppesolinas> later
[04:38:09] <giuseppesolinas> thanks Xatenev
[04:39:31] <frank_o> Omar-: keep me posted on the app, best use the jqm forums ;)
[04:39:47] <Omar-> varrg http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/sud45a5p/
[04:40:11] <Omar-> frank_o i want to add more deatures
[04:40:12] <frank_o> Omar-: im working on the brand / layout in my head every night before i go to sleep :D it's going to be awesome
[04:40:15] <Omar-> features
[04:40:22] <Omar-> lol
[04:40:29] <Omar-> i hope so ;)
[04:40:31] <frank_o> :D
[04:40:43] <frank_o> keep doing the do!!
[04:40:44] <frank_o> brb
[05:01:40] <lilsammy> trying to access a json object value like so "data['data'][0].company_name" that works fine but how can you do it like "data['data'][0].var_containg_key_name"
[05:02:18] <Uhkis> [var_containing_key_name]
[05:03:16] <Omar-> varrg http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/u7mx6gcr/7/ just clone it and replce leaf with its clone
[05:03:38] <Uhkis> i like how you can click the leaves away
[05:04:33] <varrg> I'll look at it in a sec, Omar- !
[05:06:02] <Omar-> this is better varrg http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/ttoLkcoo/
[05:09:35] <Omar-> varrg hmmm..if you animate more than one leaf at a time, it breaks
[05:09:39] <Omar-> i'm fixing it
[05:15:20] <giuseppesolinas> back
[05:15:32] <giuseppesolinas> I'll repost the question because I had to go away
[05:15:38] <giuseppesolinas> can someone answer this: I am binding a fuction like this: $(document).on('click', '.mydiv', function() {...}). I have all wrapped un in a function that I call to initialize my scripts when new content is loaded. If I call the 'main' function twice the 'click' function gets executed twice per click.
[05:15:46] <Omar-> varrg http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/o2u3smou/ fixed
[05:15:46] <giuseppesolinas> how do I prevent this?
[05:15:52] <Omar-> now works like a charm
[05:16:34] <decx> you already delegate future items with this syntax giuseppesolinas no need to do it everytime you generate a new element
[05:17:12] <Omar-> giuseppesolinas easy way .off("click", ".mydiv").on("click", ".mydiv", function () {});
[05:17:29] <decx> just say no
[05:17:34] <Omar-> better way, place listeners outside your function and call them once
[05:17:37] <giuseppesolinas> Omar-, I've tried but it still duplicates the event
[05:19:09] <Uhkis> event.stopPropagation();
[05:19:15] <varrg> Omar-, alright, I was out having a smoke, I'll look at it now
[05:19:28] <giuseppesolinas> decx at some point I need to re-initialize everythig
[05:19:31] <Omar-> varrg you reminded me, I need a smoke too..thanks!
[05:19:44] <Uhkis> dirty smokers!
[05:19:53] <decx> you probably don't giuseppesolinas fiddle up
[05:20:07] <Omar-> giuseppesolinas as decx said, you're already delegating
[05:20:15] <Omar-> no need to re-do the job again
[05:20:31] <Omar-> listeners are attached to current DOM elements and the ones to come
[05:20:45] * Omar- hands Uhkis a cig
[05:20:52] <Omar-> guys, where's Cork?
[05:21:04] <Uhkis> Omar-: i have my own, thanks tho
[05:21:16] <varrg> Omar-, looks cool!
[05:21:36] <Omar-> varrg 10 eur pls ;)
[05:21:45] <Omar-> i accept paypal
[05:21:46] <Omar-> haha
[05:21:56] <varrg> I'll throw you a cigarette ;)
[05:22:30] <Omar-> i'm rolling one, thanks ;)
[05:22:42] <Omar-> varrg you've done the hard part
[05:22:50] <kokut> Hello, I included jquery 2.x at the top of my site and jquery 1.1 after. I called it after with $ and it works on firefox but not in chrome, how can i fix this? with jQuery instead of dollar sign it doesn't work.
[05:22:51] <Omar-> i tweaked it a bit
[05:23:09] <decx> the trick is to not load 2
[05:23:17] <Omar-> kokut why 2.x and 1.1?
[05:23:18] <anli> Is there a mouseover but some tolerance so I can be near instead of over?
[05:23:27] <anli> but with some tolerance
[05:23:46] <kokut> Omar-: because i need 2.x for bootstrap and 1.1 is included by wordpress
[05:23:51] <decx> you can create a virtual bounding box anli
[05:23:59] <anli> Yeah, but that will suck
[05:24:09] <anli> I create a mousenear function instead
[05:24:19] <anli> Using http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7911604/function-for-mouse-near-an-element-in-jquery
[05:24:22] <decx> that would include creating a virtual bounding box
[05:24:32] <anli> No, I can react on mousemove on <body>
[05:24:43] <anli> And then do the required calculations
[05:24:56] <decx> that's what a virtual bounding box entails
[05:25:06] <decx> point location +- distance
[05:25:18] <decx> basic collision detection
[05:25:20] <varrg> Omar-, I don't seem to need to clone it: http://jsfiddle.net/o2u3smou/2/
[05:25:20] <anli> Well, I can use pythagorean distance as well
[05:25:34] <Uhkis> kokut: just tell wp not to include that
[05:25:38] <varrg> Omar-, also, performance wise, should I add the transitioneend with .one() inside the event. or keep it as I have?
[05:25:43] <decx> well what else are you gonna use for distance between points, that's just math ;D
[05:25:48] <kokut> Uhkis: where?
[05:25:52] <anli> :)
[05:26:19] <Uhkis> kokut: no idea, i don't use wp
[05:26:40] <Uhkis> i use decent cms's ;)
[05:26:41] <Cork> hmm?
[05:26:52] <Cork> Omar-: ever heard of lunch? :)
[05:27:08] <decx> even the fiercest support warriors have to eat
[05:29:51] <krambiorix> How can i set the values of an <input type="file" multiple /> ?
[05:30:10] <Cork> krambiorix: you can't
[05:30:33] <krambiorix> Ow
[05:30:34] <decx> like a virtual blob file?
[05:30:43] <krambiorix> Cork, and not multi?
[05:30:50] <krambiorix> Cork, a normal file input
[05:31:02] <Cork> krambiorix: file inputs is for a user to enter the file
[05:31:09] <Cork> the page can't add things to this element
[05:31:34] <krambiorix> Cork, can i create them?
[05:31:43] <Cork> create them?
[05:31:46] <Cork> as in?
[05:32:35] <krambiorix> Cork, create and append them to the page with the file set ?
[05:32:45] <decx> from where?
[05:33:02] <Cork> krambiorix: you can work with file objects, but you can't create them
[05:33:17] <Cork> meaning you can get a file object form an <input type="file"> but you can't create them you're self
[05:34:54] <krambiorix> Cork, how can i form an input type="file"  element from a file?
[05:35:04] <Cork> you can't
[05:35:08] <decx> what the hell does that even mean??
[05:35:30] <Cork> you can't fake a user input for an <input type="file"> element
[05:36:58] <decx> do you want to get an image from a url and have it replace your type="file" in your form?
[05:37:30] <Omar-> Cork how was your lunch? ;)
[05:37:39] <Cork> nice
[05:37:46] <krambiorix> Cork, i use dropzonejs to upload files. When the user selects his files (via a browser 'browse' popup) i get the file objects. FOr every file object i want to create a hidden file input.  So that's not possible?
[05:38:12] <Omar-> varrg your last fiddle looks much better. .on() is enough
[05:38:17] <Cork> krambiorix: as far as i know, no it isn't simplest solution is to use ajax
[05:39:23] <varrg> Omar-, alright. Thanks a bunch, you saved me from solving it in some highly questionable way. I'm done now. Off now as well. Cheers
[05:39:47] <Omar-> varrg you're welcome. good luck!
[05:39:48] <anli> I am not sure how to detect ie any longer
[05:39:57] <krambiorix> Cork,  is it possibe to merge 2 forms in one? :)
[05:39:58] <anli> My IE reports Mozilla/5.0
[05:40:06] <anli> How is that IE?
[05:40:22] <Cork> anli: you shouldn't detect browsers based on the ua
[05:40:31] <decx> your ie is clearly transvendor
[05:40:41] <anli> I need to do it because IE treats scrollbars differently
[05:40:45] <anli> hehe
[05:40:56] <anli> Oh, maybe its set to ie9
[05:41:12] <decx> test for something that ie can or cant do
[05:41:15] <decx> not ua
[05:41:36] <decx> for example these conditionals everyone puts around <html>
[05:41:38] <Omar-> this doesn't help? http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167820
[05:42:29] <Cork> decx: that is even worse
[05:42:39] <Cork> decx: you should not test for behavior to detect a browser
[05:42:45] <decx> hey it was just the first thing that came to mind
[05:43:04] <Cork> cause those solutions are what forces browser to keep broken behaviors
[05:43:49] <decx> <!--[if IE 7]><html class="no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8 lt-ie" like that
[05:44:05] <Cork> that is ok
[05:44:11] <Cork> doesn't work for ie9+ though
[05:44:26] <decx> just c/ped the first best i found ;)
[05:46:06] <anli> The browser was set to "edge"
[05:46:21] <decx> well good thing it didnt spear you then
[05:46:46] <anli> The thing is that I am still using browser detection by user agent substring matching
[05:47:07] <anli> Seems to be the only way of fighting inconsistent right edge/scrollbar calculations
[05:47:31] <decx> i cant remember what the problem was
[05:47:33] <Uhkis> box-sizing ftw
[05:47:46] <Cork> ya
[05:47:48] <decx> ie includes scrollbar in window width or something?
[05:47:58] <Cork> also test for the wrong calculation instead of "the browser i know has the problem"
[05:48:09] <Cork> that was my point before
[05:48:22] <Cork> cause if the browser fixes the problem, your page breaks
[05:48:56] <Cork> so instead test if the error exists in the browser, and handle it
[05:53:15] <decx> so how do you test that?
[05:55:14] <Cork> you could create an inline-block element out an element in it and check that the dimensions change as expected for example
[05:55:57] <Cork> the only two things i can think of that you can't test for like that is rendering bugs (it doesn't really exist so how could you test for it?)
[05:56:01] <Cork> and network stack bugs
[05:59:16] <De0Sama> I have some code to switch between business, and normal prices for my company's products (after they hit a button)
[05:59:22] <De0Sama> can anyone tell my why this code isn't working?
[05:59:42] <Dorf> because it doesn't exist
[05:59:51] <Uhkis> you have a bug in there
[05:59:57] <De0Sama> http://codepen.io/jcc2k4/pen/YPBbPy
[05:59:59] <De0Sama> haha
[06:00:02] <decx> magnets
[06:00:06] <De0Sama> I didn't want to post 4 lines of code in irc. :(
[06:00:09] <Dorf> how do they work?
[06:00:17] <De0Sama> basically, when you hit the "business" button
[06:00:24] <De0Sama> '#business'
[06:00:34] <decx> why do you change data?
[06:00:34] <De0Sama> it will go through each row of my table
[06:00:39] <decx> what do you expect that to do?
[06:00:50] <De0Sama> i want to set data-price = data-business
[06:00:55] <De0Sama> oh, wait
[06:01:03] <Dorf> put the html in there
[06:01:04] <De0Sama> doesn't it need to be data('businessPrice).val()?
[06:01:11] <De0Sama> or html?
[06:01:16] <decx> no
[06:01:42] <decx> so what do you do afterwards with data('price')
[06:01:56] <Uhkis> you would've saved so many keypresses by pasting the html there too
[06:01:59] <De0Sama> i do some other calculations on it
[06:02:09] <decx> how?
[06:02:34] <decx> you see this isnt exactly a working demo that shows the concept you are trying to achieve ;)
[06:02:51] <amigoo89> hi guys, I want you to ask a question but I can't copy a link from jsfiddle, do I need an account?
[06:02:55] <Dorf> value takes what's in the value.  put the actual html in the html section.
[06:03:00] <De0Sama> decx, updated: http://codepen.io/jcc2k4/pen/YPBbPy
[06:03:35] <De0Sama> decx can i PM you?
[06:03:45] <krambiorix> which file drag and drop to upload files is the best?
[06:03:54] <decx> amigoo89: there's a spam attack on jsfiddle and jsbin, they probably turned off anonymous saving
[06:04:09] <nmpribeiro> hi there mates. I'm looking for a way/plugin to automatically animate some divs position change (through parent width change or display change and so on...). haven't found anything meaningfull from google searches. thanks
[06:04:35] <amigoo89> okay nevermind, I use jsbin
[06:05:47] <GoSox> if i want to use a regular function as a call back, do i include the name of the function as a string? I can't find the actual syntax on this in teh docs
[06:06:05] <GoSox> $.post( ).fail( "http_fail" );
[06:06:08] <GoSox> like that?
[06:06:20] <Cork> GoSox: it shouldn't be a string
[06:06:24] <decx> De0Sama: i'm on my way out for lunch
[06:06:28] <Cork> its correct except for that
[06:06:40] <GoSox> ah ok
[06:06:48] <De0Sama> decx: ah, ok. no worries
[06:07:00] <GoSox> i'm having a hard time testing this code out because my phone is being "too smart" and not letting me even TRY to load a page if its internet is turned off
[06:07:15] <decx> looking over it i dont see the problem on first sight De0Sama
[06:07:29] <amigoo89> so guys: I programed a simple ajax request yesterday, I started to learn jQuery and ajax, so I wanted to programm a simple request, that reads a formular value of a select list, take this variable and do a database query. the result is also supposed to show on that same site. so far it works. my problem is now: since I pressed the submit button, it gives me an lag of 1 seconds, because I also sets an interval, that refrehes the ph
[06:07:36] <De0Sama> decx, hmmmmm yeah... it SHOULD be setting data-price... right?
[06:07:40] <amigoo89> that's the code: http://jsbin.com/qitojawuva/1
[06:08:03] <amigoo89> sorry: http://jsbin.com/qitojawuva/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:08:05] <Cork> De0Sama: .data() does NOT update the attribute on the element
[06:08:23] <De0Sama> cork oh, really?
[06:08:28] <decx> doesnt look like the attribute is used anywhere
[06:08:32] <decx> it's all data()
[06:08:40] <Cork> De0Sama: .data uses a cache that exists inside jquery
[06:08:45] <De0Sama> hmmm
[06:08:53] <Cork> De0Sama: this cache gets populated with data- attributes if empty
[06:08:53] <De0Sama> that throws a wrench in my design, haha
[06:09:10] <De0Sama> Cork, any idea how i could achieve what i'm trying to do?
[06:09:13] <Cork> De0Sama: if you absolute need to have the attribute use .attr
[06:09:13] <sacho> why?
[06:09:14] <De0Sama> hidden elements?
[06:09:25] <Cork> but note that you can't store anything except strings if you do that
[06:09:27] <sacho> why do you care if the attributes are set?
[06:09:37] <decx> i dont see how that affects you De0Sama you dont get attr anywhere
[06:09:47] <De0Sama> sacho, I need to display accurate prices to potential customers
[06:10:03] <Cork> De0Sama: so just use .data to get the value
[06:10:13] <Cork> and everything will work fine
[06:10:41] <decx> at first the demo did too little, now it does too much for a quick analysis ;)
[06:10:50] <Cork> amigoo89: you really should avoid calling ajax inside a setinterval
[06:10:53] <De0Sama> then i'd have to have checks for whether or not #business is selected every time i get data('price') everywhere in my code?
[06:11:18] <sacho> as opposed to..?
[06:11:19] <Cork> amigoo89: if the server takes more then a second to answer, you will not have the delay anymore
[06:11:32] <De0Sama> sacho, setting data-price when it's selected? :)
[06:11:44] <Cork> huh?
[06:11:46] <amigoo89> Cork: do you mean that the delay will be even higher?
[06:11:55] <sacho> De0Sama, you're adding 2+2 and getting 5, somehow
[06:12:08] <Cork> amigoo89: setinterval will queue an execution of the function every 1000 ms
[06:12:13] <De0Sama> sacho, i'm not sure i understand?
[06:12:15] <sacho> how does setting an *attribute* vs .data() change your logic?
[06:12:20] <Cork> it doesn't care if the function has run to compleation or not
[06:12:34] <Cork> amigoo89: you should use setTimeout in the success callback instead
[06:12:50] <Cork> that way you get a delay that starts when the connection is closes
[06:12:56] <sacho> De0Sama, you can set .data('price') when #business is selected as well - what's the difference?
[06:13:01] <amigoo89> setTimeout, does also reload the script of x-cycle?
[06:13:18] <Cork> amigoo89: uh, what?
[06:13:30] <De0Sama> sacho, that's why i'm here. My code isn't working to set data('price')
[06:13:32] <De0Sama> :)
[06:13:32] <Cork> settimeout works exactly like setinterval except it only fire once
[06:13:39] <De0Sama> sacho, can I PM you?
[06:13:50] <amigoo89> I used setInterval, in order to refresh it every second, Cork
[06:13:56] <Cork> De0Sama: you most likely won't get anyone wanting to help you over pm
[06:14:05] <Cork> amigoo89: but that is the problem
[06:14:39] <Cork> amigoo89: 1000. first ajax call, 2000: second ajax call is queued; 2001: first ajax call completes
[06:14:45] <amigoo89> why? the thing is that it is needed, since you press the button, the script is supposed to load and the refresh every second, in order to get the newest updates immediately
[06:14:53] <Cork> you don't get any delay if you have network latency
[06:14:57] <Cork> so you will hammer the server
[06:15:09] <Cork> you want to start the timeout when the response comes back
[06:15:29] <Cork> so if the response takes time you get longer update cycles instead of multiple connections per user
[06:17:25] <amigoo89> okay I'm not 100% sure, what you mean exactly... where is the difference between setInterval and setTimeout?
[06:17:52] <Cork> amigoo89: setInterval(func, 1000) queues a call every second no considerations made for anything
[06:18:25] <Cork> setTimeout(func, 1000) waits a second then calls the function, if you want to call it again you need to call a second setTimeout
[06:18:55] <Cork> so you can add logic to stall the queue if things get cogged up
[06:19:11] <Cork> like ex. wait for the last ajax call to complete before calling it again
[06:19:59] <Cork> so if say $.ajax in you're code takes 5 seconds to complete, it means you after 5 seconds will have 4 open connections
[06:20:07] <Cork> and after 10 have ~7
[06:20:09] <Cork> and so on
[06:20:29] <Cork> and at that point the browser will throttle the connections
[06:20:43] <decx> was about to say, "and so on" for one more connection ^^
[06:20:48] <Cork> and you will after a few minutes have a queue of a big load of ajax calls
[06:20:59] <decx> this pizza is amazing
[06:21:04] <decx> i should eat health
[06:21:05] <decx> y
[06:21:12] <decx> tomorrow
[06:21:17] <Cork> amigoo89: and as you never care about more then one call at a time
[06:21:30] <Cork> you should instead put a setTimeout in a complete/always callback
[06:21:44] <Cork> so you only start the timer when the previous connection has completed
[06:22:25] <amigoo89> okay now I get that thanks
[06:22:28] <amigoo89> but the thing is
[06:22:43] <amigoo89> I used setTimeout now, instead of setInterval, and it doesn't refresh it anymore
[06:23:07] <Cork> amigoo89: you need to call it after each itteration
[06:23:11] <Cork> that is the point :)
[06:25:45] <amigoo89> Okay and how, Cork?
[06:25:46] <amigoo89> http://jsbin.com/tilutuxadu/1/edit?js,output
[06:37:18] <Cork> amigoo89: http://jsbin.com/nutuvayasa/1/edit
[06:40:57] <Symes_Web> Hi, could anyone give a little review on my code? https://jsfiddle.net/Specksavers/9a2projy/2/
[06:41:19] <Cork> Symes_Web: ask specific questions
[06:41:31] <Cork> not for blanket "reviews"
[06:45:02] <Symes_Web> Sorry it's just codereview stackexchange is being a prat
[06:45:30] <decx> i can give a review, the effect looks great but i dont know how robust the implementation deals with more and more stuff being thrown at it
[06:46:32] <Symes_Web> Thanks, not sure how to really make the implementation better
[06:46:39] <Symes_Web> Guess thats what Im trying to get help with
[06:47:19] <decx> like if you already animate the contentelement from the buttons position to its center position, why not just scrap the button and only deal with a single element
[06:48:16] <Symes_Web> Not quite sure I understand what you mean
[06:48:34] <Symes_Web> If you mean get rid of the button - there would be nothing to click on
[06:48:53] <decx> well you do everything with js so it doesnt matter if you click a button or a div
[06:49:02] <Symes_Web> Oh do you mean make the button and container the same element
[06:49:09] <decx> right
[06:49:21] <Symes_Web> Yeah I thought of that but wasn't sure how to make it work
[06:49:26] <Cork> decx: it does actualy
[06:49:35] <Cork> jsut click on a div isn't accessable
[06:49:46] <decx> good point
[06:49:54] <decx> i guess you can wrap it all inside the button ^^
[06:50:19] <Symes_Web> Lol yeh but not much point really
[06:50:21] <decx> or have the button inside the content div
[06:50:40] <Symes_Web> I could make the button a div
[06:50:58] <Symes_Web> and have the div with the CLick me text displaed
[06:51:03] <Symes_Web> Then the text hides
[06:51:09] <Symes_Web> Div changes size and position
[06:51:14] <Symes_Web> New content shows
[06:52:08] <mekhami> what's the best way to append a bunch of markup after an ajax call? I've got some pretty long markup, the ajax call gets 10 or so of these objects, appends them to the dom etc. but it's pretty hefty and i don't wanna paste 40 lines of markup into a jquery function.
[06:52:39] <Cork> mekhami: you mean you create the markup in code?
[06:52:47] <Cork> and get like json from the server?
[06:54:04] <mekhami> well i already have the json
[06:54:05] <GoSox> so i just added a particular element to my page via .html( ) , how can I select one of those new items. $("#id") doesn't seem to do it
[06:54:07] <mekhami> i want to build up the dom elements
[06:54:20] <mekhami> but i dont' wanna paste 50 lines of html into a jquery function
[06:54:25] <mekhami> know what i mean?
[06:54:35] <mekhami> like i can append it to the dom as one big string but that's ugly and hard to adjust later
[06:54:56] <decx> if you get a html string from your json what else are you gonna do?
[06:55:26] <Symes_Web> Ive had the same problem mekhami
[06:55:34] <Symes_Web> If I understand you correctly
[06:55:46] <Symes_Web> Just ended up putting all the markup in the html file
[06:56:09] <Cork> mekhami: ya, that was why i asked, you should use a template engine
[06:56:28] <Cork> like jqote2 or handbrake, mushash or the like
[06:56:49] <Cork> having long blobs of html in js is very hard to maintain
[06:57:26] <Cork> you could also have a look at <template>, it is not cross browser yet
[06:57:36] <Cork> but might be interesting to read about for the future
[06:57:41] <Cork> ?mdn template
[06:57:46] <GoSox> for creating events on new elements, the google says to use .on( ), but what about when you are not setting events. What if you just want to do something to a new element, like set some attributes etc.
[06:57:52] <Cork> <_<
[06:58:05] <Cork> oh, no bot...
[06:58:49] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
[07:01:47] <Symes_Web> What would be a fairly advanced jQuery project to test me skills with?
[07:03:44] <delinquentme> ok I have no idea why this doesnt run: https://jsfiddle.net/x8f72os5/
[07:04:21] <Xatenev> delinquentme: first thing: its .addScenarioButton
[07:04:33] <Xatenev> aswell what the hell is class="" class=""
[07:04:39] <decx> delinquentme:  #addScenarioButton isnt .addScenarioButton
[07:04:46] <Xatenev> u put a class not an id there
[07:04:48] <Cork> delinquentme: cause there is no parents between secario2 and container
[07:05:06] <decx> oh there's more?
[07:05:07] <Cork> delinquentme: you most likely want .closest instead
[07:05:08] <decx> ^^
[07:06:01] <delinquentme> $('#scenario-02')
[07:06:11] <delinquentme> why do I get null when I place that in the console ?
[07:07:19] <Cork> delinquentme: https://jsfiddle.net/x8f72os5/1/
[07:07:49] <decx> why use scenario-02 as the origin anyway?
[07:08:15] <momomo> can someone please reopen the ticket ? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3400
[07:10:52] <GoSox> click-it or ticket
[07:12:26] <Cork> momomo: i would have to agree with the statement, it follows the spec
[07:12:50] <Cork> it is ok what it does
[07:13:10] <Cork> if you have problems with you you can include a plugin that replaces param, or use json instead
[07:13:55] <momomo> Cork, noo its not
[07:14:09] <momomo> I had this discussion yesterday, and we all agreed it does not do what it is supposed to do
[07:14:11] <Cork> uh, there is even a link to the spec in the ticket
[07:14:39] <momomo> but the spec is not broken by not replacing spaces with +
[07:14:46] <momomo> the default is spaces for %20
[07:14:52] <momomo> which is fine
[07:15:06] <snizzle> when doing .post, I get a returned object Object. How do I read display those errors?  http://pastebin.com/TgCBkVAH
[07:15:10] <momomo> in fact, decodeURIComponent does not expect +++ for spaces at all
[07:15:15] <Cork> the spec explicitly states you should escape ' ' as '+'
[07:15:45] <Cork> %20 works, but it is not according to spec
[07:16:56] <momomo> Cork, not according to this spec: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986
[07:17:17] <Cork> momomo: that is a more generic spec, the html spec trumps it
[07:17:24] <momomo> http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1
[07:17:26] <Cork> just like how url parsing does it
[07:17:56] <momomo> Cork, can you explain why decodeURIComponent is unable to decode that ?
[07:18:13] <Symes_Web> Is it better to use objects or prototypes?
[07:18:46] <Cork> momomo: no, i haven't looked into that part
[07:19:07] <Cork> momomo: but the spec is very clear on how the value should be encoded
[07:19:09] <momomo> are you saying, firefox, chrome, ie and all those companies which have their own js implementation chooses to encode and decode it differently?
[07:19:25] <Cork> momomo: its different specs
[07:19:35] <Cork> i would have to lookinto the different specs to answer that clearly
[07:19:53] <Cork> decodeURIComponent is defined in the dom spec
[07:19:54] <momomo> param clearly uses encodeURICompnent but then at the end it fucks everything up
[07:20:04] <delinquentme> any reason that my chrome developer tools removes any console history?
[07:20:14] <Cork> but that doesn't change it should follow the mimytype encodeing specifications
[07:20:15] <momomo> delinquentme, there is a check box
[07:20:31] <delinquentme> momomo:+1
[07:20:58] <Cork> momomo: i agree the spec is weird, but it is still the spec
[07:21:08] <momomo> Cork, you are following the wrong spec
[07:21:17] <Cork> it would be interesting to look up what the html live spec says
[07:21:26] <momomo> the only addition you are doing is adding this last bit to adhere to the "spec"
[07:21:39] <Cork> momomo: ietf is the wrong spec too
[07:21:41] <momomo> and meanwhile you are breaking compatibilty with everything
[07:21:44] <AlluringMe> How do I do something like this?? It does not seem to work
[07:21:46] <AlluringMe> http://pastebin.com/mdBrZBn9
[07:21:55] <AlluringMe> Works fine w/o a loop
[07:22:51] <Ricaz> I add a row to a table using .append() on the table. Now, I want to also bind a .click() event on the added row, that will delete it. How do I do this?
[07:23:04] <momomo> Cork, http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp
[07:23:14] <momomo> URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign or with %20.
[07:23:18] <momomo> OR
[07:25:30] <Cork> momomo: here is the correct spec https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#application/x-www-form-urlencoded-encoding-algorithm
[07:25:36] <Cork> If the byte is 0x20 (U+0020 SPACE if interpreted as ASCII)
[07:25:36] <Cork>     Replace the byte with a single 0x2B byte (U+002B PLUS SIGN character (+) if interpreted as ASCII).
[07:25:44] <Cork> so yes jquery is doing the correct thing
[07:26:00] <momomo> Cork, from wikipedia:
[07:26:01] <momomo> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding
[07:26:15] <Cork> momomo: that is url not www-form-urlencoded
[07:26:21] <Cork> that is different specs
[07:26:21] <momomo> The encoding used by default is based on a very early version of the general URI percent-encoding rules, with a number of modifications such as newline normalization and replacing spaces with "+" instead of "%20".
[07:26:48] <momomo> Cork, the problem is that jquery is the only ones that have actually implemented this new change
[07:26:57] <Cork> uh it isn't new
[07:27:18] <Cork> its been in wide useage for very very long
[07:27:42] <Cork> 4.01 is a really old spec by now
[07:28:25] <momomo> Cork, the spec you sent is flawed
[07:28:30] <Cork> sigh
[07:28:30] <momomo> probably written by an idiot
[07:28:45] <Cork> so file a bug to the whatwg group and get it changed
[07:28:55] <momomo> for instance: Let IDL value be the concatenation of contact, a U+0020 SPACE character, and the previous value of IDL value (which at this point will always be field).
[07:29:01] <Cork> don't complain to someone following the spec
[07:29:12] <momomo> it says U+0020 SPACE character, right?
[07:29:24] <momomo> it doesn't say replace a +
[07:29:59] <momomo> so while it says it should replace spaces for + .. on other places it doesn't mentioned replacing + with something else, but the old character %20
[07:30:08] <Cork> momomo: it says if the byte is a space replace it with a +
[07:30:38] <Cork> If the byte is 0x20 (U+0020 SPACE if interpreted as ASCII) <-- if the character after convertions is a space
[07:30:43] <momomo> yes, but when going back, it doesn't say replace + with space.. on many places it instead refers to the old %20
[07:30:52] <Cork> Replace the byte with a single 0x2B byte (U+002B PLUS SIGN character (+)
[07:31:10] <momomo> yes, you are talking about space -> +
[07:31:29] <Cork> momomo: the bug you pointed to was about why space was encoded as +
[07:31:31] <momomo> but yet, on many places it only talks about %20 -> to space
[07:31:39] <momomo> it fails to mention + -> space
[07:31:46] <Cork> its encoding
[07:31:51] <Cork> what you talk about is decoding
[07:32:00] <momomo> yes, now I am talking about decoding
[07:32:10] <momomo> which is why i am showing you the document is flawed
[07:32:19] <momomo> it takes into account going from space to +
[07:32:28] <Cork> momomo: "2. Replace any U+002B PLUS SIGN characters (+) in name and value with U+0020 SPACE characters."
[07:32:39] <Cork> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#application/x-www-form-urlencoded-decoding-algorithm
[07:33:07] <Cork> quite clear to me
[07:34:59] <momomo> yes, so mozilla, google, microsoft, apple are all wrong
[07:35:13] <momomo> which is why decodeURIComponent fails to convert the plus to a space
[07:38:23] <momomo> Cork, http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.1.3.2
[07:38:38] <momomo> i guess you have to choose between 10 differnt specifications
[07:38:47] <momomo> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent
[07:39:04] <momomo> question is which one is most compatible?
[07:39:19] <momomo> at least add a flag to the params method where one can ignore this
[07:39:37] <momomo> there are plenty of people who are having alot of problems with this one
[07:40:13] <Seedmanc> Is there still no way to have response type of ajax as blob? To get images, for example.
[07:40:33] <momomo> Cork, is that possible, a flag?

[07:43:38] <delinquentme> OK so Now I have my jquery DOM being updated ... but immediately the added elements are wiped and it seems like the page is reloaded from scratch
[07:43:42] <delinquentme> anyone know whats going on here?
[07:46:00] <midori-rus> I have a sting like --string-- and I am trying to remove -- --
[07:46:11] <midori-rus> varString.replace("--","");
[07:46:20] <midori-rus> this removes only first --
[07:46:23] <midori-rus> why?
[07:46:25] <skypce> guys what is wrong with this: v
[07:46:26] <skypce> 	$( "li" ).has( "strong" ).parent().addClass("no-bullet");
[07:46:44] <skypce> i want remove bullet from li
[07:47:25] <Cork> momomo: sadly enough decodeURIComponent is a javascript specification
[07:47:42] <Cork> momomo: and yes different specifications doesn't always say the same thing
[07:47:55] <momomo> Cork, can we add a flag so everyone wins?
[07:48:01] <momomo> a parameter
[07:48:19] <momomo> a third one to params
[07:48:26] <Cork> momomo: simplest is prob to just write a small plugin that replaces .param
[07:48:34] <Cork> if you need it
[07:49:44] <momomo> I would have to copy all of this: http://pastebin.com/014nargd
[07:49:59] <momomo> i am against non optimized code and shit lying around
[07:50:32] <momomo> a third argument is the best option in my opinion
[07:50:49] <momomo> it doesn't break compatibility either
[07:50:59] <Seedmanc> bump
[07:51:05] <AssassinsMod> bump
[07:52:00] <Cork> momomo: i would recommend taking this up on the whatwg mailing list
[07:52:27] <momomo> return bool ? s.join( "&" ) : s.join( "&" ).replace( r20, "+" );
[07:52:38] <momomo> i don't know wher ethat is
[07:52:58] <Cork> have you even looked?
[07:53:08] <Cork> https://whatwg.org/mailing-list#specs
[07:53:11] <momomo> i've spent enough time arguing for this the past two days
[07:53:27] <Cork> momomo: you argue it at the wrong place, so ya...
[07:53:50] <Cork> argue it with the ones writing the spec if you think it is wrong
[07:54:14] <gdutzdc> Hello~
[07:54:23] <AssassinsMod> hi
[07:55:25] <AssassinsMod> Pure offtopic: do you guys prefer vim or an IDE? (and also do you prefer a dark or white theme)
[07:55:57] <gdutzdc> Have you ever seen sizzlejs source code?
[07:57:01] <Xatenev> Heya
[07:57:03] <Xatenev> fast question mates
[07:57:11] <Cork> AssassinsMod: sublime or vim for me
[07:57:21] <Cork> vim if i need to edit in a console
[07:57:24] <Xatenev> I got an ul, and i wanna check if there is ANY *visible* span inside the <li> of the <ul>
[07:57:25] <Cork> else sublime
[07:57:30] <Xatenev> any ideas what functions i can use?
[07:57:50] <Cork> Xatenev: visible meaning?
[07:58:01] <Xatenev> display: block
[07:58:02] <Xatenev> or span
[07:58:06] <Cork> ah
[07:58:11] <Xatenev> everything except display: none :P
[07:58:17] <Xatenev> is that even possible?
[07:58:37] <Cork> $(ul).find('li span:visible').length > 0
[07:58:41] <delinquentme> ok designing sets of elements which could increase from 0-1000 elements... and I want to increment their ids with a number
[07:58:51] <Xatenev> Cork: trying :)
[07:59:02] <mekhami> i have this valid json object stored in the variable 'data'
[07:59:03] <mekhami> http://dpaste.com/3DYH235
[07:59:04] <AssassinsMod> He could just do $("ul > li > span:visible")
[07:59:12] <delinquentme> should I be starting and building #element-0001 ... #element-0999
[07:59:16] <mekhami> but when i try to console.log( data[0] );  I get the first character ([)
[07:59:24] <mekhami> it's treating it as just a string rather than a json object
[07:59:25] <Xatenev> AssassinsMod: hm seems shorter
[07:59:36] <Cork> delinquentme: i usually get suspisius when ppl want to have a number after an id
[07:59:44] <Cork> cause often they don't want an id in those cases
[07:59:53] <Seedmanc> Is there still no way to have response type of ajax as blob? To get images, for example.
[07:59:53] <Cork> so: are you sure you actually want an id?
[07:59:54] <delinquentme> or should I just start at #element-1 ... #element-10 ... #element-99
[08:00:02] <AssassinsMod> Xatenev: that is using advanced css selectors
[08:00:11] <delinquentme> Cork:I think you might be onto something.
[08:00:23] <Cork> delinquentme: or is a class what you actually want
[08:00:31] <delinquentme> Cork:you know me so well
[08:00:33] <delinquentme> how?
[08:00:39] <Cork> :)
[08:00:44] <Xatenev> Its Corks dojo mate
[08:00:45] <Xatenev> :D
[08:00:47] <Xatenev> #corks-dojo
[08:00:51] <AssassinsMod> fated persons
[08:03:19] <mekhami> anyone know why my json object is being teated like a string?
[08:03:24] <mekhami> treated/
[08:03:45] <Cork> mekhami: most likely cause the server doesn't set the correct Content-Type
[08:04:13] <Cork> (sets Content-Type: text/html instead of Content-Type: application/json)
[08:04:25] <mekhami> that's right. i forgot to add dataType to my ajax function
[08:04:26] <mekhami> thanks
[08:04:38] <Cork> mekhami: dataType doesn't control that
[08:04:45] <mekhami> sureeee seemed to.
[08:04:51] <mekhami> i change that and it's working.
[08:05:00] <Cork> mekhami: dataType affects what Accepts: is sent to the server
[08:05:15] <Cork> mekhami: so the server you're working with changes it content-type based on the request type
[08:05:23] <Cork> so, ok :)
[08:05:29] <AssassinsMod> Cork: maybe he did set up bad the request method and the issue was not caused by the server, could it be?
[08:05:41] <mekhami> it's wordpress
[08:05:44] <mekhami> just blame wordpress.
[08:05:47] <Cork> AssassinsMod: it is always controlled by the server
[08:06:01] <Cork> dataType changes what Accepts: type is included in the request
[08:06:19] <Cork> many frameworks handle this
[08:06:36] <Cork> if you write the code without a framework it normally doesn't do anything though
[08:07:23] <Cork> and ya, i assumed too much in this case :)
[08:07:53] <AssassinsMod> well, in the end everybody is happy :)
[08:08:03] <Xatenev> We need you guys @ #codeandphilosophy ! :P
[08:08:08] <Xatenev> More users!! :p
[08:08:12] <Xatenev> xD
[08:12:55] <anurag_> HI
[08:13:32] <anurag_> Can we access dialog/alert boxes from jquery
[08:14:31] <Cork> anurag_: you mean native ones?
[08:14:32] <sebaj> Been banging my head on this for four hours now: How do I find the index of the array [3,16] in the two-dimensional array [[1, 1], [1, 16], [2, 1], [2, 16], [3, 1], [3, 16], [4, 1], [4, 16]] ?  Using $.grep?
[08:14:42] <anurag_> yes
[08:14:46] <Cork> anurag_: no
[08:14:56] <Cork> sebaj: $.inArray
[08:15:09] <beaconwriter> Why would this fire an actual click event instead of setting an event handler?
[08:15:14] <beaconwriter> $("#foo").click(function(){alert('hello')});
[08:15:24] <anurag_> Like if a dialog box appear, and on clicking of OK button , i am redirected to new url..how can iknow that url before hand
[08:15:37] <Cork> beaconwriter: it shouldn't
[08:17:07] <Cork> sebaj: oh, sorry no inArray doesn't take a function
[08:18:36] <Cork> sebaj: best option is prob a $.each loop
[08:18:46] <Xatenev> Cork, AssassinsMod works great
[08:18:48] <Xatenev> thanks for the quick help :]
[08:19:54] <sebaj> @Cork ah yeah that should work - thanks so much!
[08:20:02] <rubyonrailed> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/99c421eb667a49c08a1f I'm appending the class "school-grade", but the top example won't work, while the bottom one does.  Can someone explain that to me
[08:20:37] <Cork> sebaj: http://jsfiddle.net/t0g5bnfm/
[08:21:26] <sebaj> Cork beautiful!  really appreciate it!
[08:22:46] <beaconwriter> I'm trying to write a tm script to help me checkout on target.com
[08:22:58] <beaconwriter> after you add something to the cart and go to checkout
[08:23:05] <beaconwriter> you enter your name and address
[08:23:22] <beaconwriter> and then need to click the button to "save & continue"
[08:23:34] <beaconwriter> I am trying to attach an event handler to that button
[08:23:36] <beaconwriter> http://jsfiddle.net/jzgeq6px/
[08:23:54] <beaconwriter> but the event handler keeps firing an actual click event
[08:27:13] <gdutzdc> http://jsfiddle.net/o2t7643o/
[08:27:25] <gdutzdc> beaconwriter:http://jsfiddle.net/o2t7643o/
[08:34:19] <beaconwriter> gdutzdc: nope, still firing click event
[08:34:30] <beaconwriter> changed it a bit, but still nothing http://jsfiddle.net/o2t7643o/2/
[08:36:35] <robertmaxrees> var continueButton = $("span.buttonText").filter(':contains("continue")')[0]; isn't what you want.
[08:36:39] <robertmaxrees> .eq(e) is what you want.
[08:36:40] <Omar-> hi
[08:36:43] <robertmaxrees> *.eq(0)
[08:42:03] <beaconwriter> robertmaxrees: That's it!!
[08:42:07] <beaconwriter> Thank you
[08:42:15] <beaconwriter> why did that make a difference?
[08:42:23] <robertmaxrees> using [0] will get you the underlying DOM node.
[08:42:29] <robertmaxrees> .on() only exists for jquery objects.
[08:42:47] <robertmaxrees> though if you're using .filter(), why not just grab the first one in there?
[08:44:23] <beaconwriter> like so?  var continueButton = $("span.buttonText").filter(':contains("continue")').first();
[08:44:58] <robertmaxrees> or use a function in filter to be more explicit.
[08:45:00] <robertmaxrees> just an idea.
[09:24:03] <Omar-> "me" when I resolve a problem https://imgur.com/gallery/5CEqmik
[09:25:31] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha niiiice
[09:26:42] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, I'm using div.body p:eq2 to get the second paragraph. but if I add something between with another paragraph it gets that too.  How do I select it so that it gets the direct second child
[09:26:45] <CocoStorm> and not nested ones?
[09:27:02] <Omar-> robertmaxrees haha..
[09:27:15] <Omar-> loadedmetadata is fired before video is fully loaded
[09:27:35] <robertmaxrees> CocoStorm you want something like .children() - $(body).children('p').eq(2)
[09:28:04] <CocoStorm> hmm tried that for some reason it's undefined
[09:28:14] <robertmaxrees> what's undefined?
[09:28:19] <robertmaxrees> err, '.body'\
[09:28:22] <robertmaxrees> not (body)
[09:28:55] <CocoStorm> tried that too hmm one sec
[09:29:15] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[09:29:24] <silverdust> How do I empty everything after like $(element).after(empty())
[09:29:44] <AssassinsMod> empty?
[09:30:02] <silverdust> That was a guess try. I need to remove every content/elements after this element
[09:30:12] <silverdust> or maybe remove is a better word
[09:30:19] <robertmaxrees> why?
[09:30:22] <AssassinsMod> if you have to purge it's sub-elements you could say $(element).children().remove()
[09:30:25] <AssassinsMod> i think
[09:30:48] <AssassinsMod> if you want to remove the element itself $(element).remove()
[09:31:04] <AssassinsMod> if you want to remove everything inside it you could try $(element).html("")
[09:31:47] <silverdust> I am doing a $(element).after('new content') and I want this new contents to replace the former contents after it
[09:32:26] <CocoStorm> robertmaxrees: ah it worked, thanks
[09:32:30] <CocoStorm> I was using .equals()
[09:32:32] <CocoStorm> java habbit
[09:32:35] <CocoStorm> eh lol
[09:32:54] <silverdust> instead it pushes former existing after content forward and puts the new ones directly after the element
[09:33:06] <m1su> CocoStorm: you could just do (".body > p").eq(1)
[09:33:10] <silverdust> I'll make a fiddle
[09:35:35] <CocoStorm> m1su: cheers
[09:36:03] <Juslintek> Hi anyone using phpstorms file watcher?
[09:36:15] <silverdust> I want to totally take out 'I'm not so cool' here http://jsfiddle.net/tatLycwk/
[09:36:46] <robertmaxrees> silverdust you'll need to rethink this then :)
[09:37:17] <silverdust> the button wouldn't be available anymore in the real application so they can't keep putting things after
[09:37:31] <silverdust> It's only once it's possible
[09:37:40] <robertmaxrees> is there any way you can wrap the other half of the text in an element?
[09:37:50] <robertmaxrees> the "I'm not so cool" part?
[09:38:10] <CausaMortis> silverdust, $('#js-cool span').text(); ?
[09:38:22] <silverdust> Yea I can. I think I'll just do that
[09:38:31] <robertmaxrees> because this is the other way: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tatLycwk/2/
[09:38:38] <robertmaxrees> given the strange markup.
[09:38:57] <robertmaxrees> CausaMortis $('#js-cool span') doesn't match anything in that fiddle.
[09:39:04] <decx> previousElementSibling.lastChild.textContent ^^
[09:39:16] <robertmaxrees> decx++ that's another way
[09:39:28] <silverdust> This is the exact kind of wizardry I was looking for
[09:39:38] <silverdust> $toKeep is new to me
[09:39:47] <robertmaxrees> it's just a var.
[09:40:05] <silverdust> oh I'm dumb
[09:40:12] <silverdust> I just read it well
[09:40:14] <robertmaxrees> the important takeaway is that you're specifying the content you want to keep, replacing everything with it, then appending after that.
[09:40:57] <silverdust> Yeea I perused it a second time and it makes sense
[09:41:04] <adavia> Is it quiet possible im not able to listen a click event because the content is being loaded remotly?
[09:41:15] <robertmaxrees> adavia pretty much.
[09:41:19] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[09:41:39] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {});
[09:41:44] <adavia> robertmaxrees: instead of preventdefault?
[09:41:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:41:54] <robertmaxrees> no...
[09:41:57] <CausaMortis> oh apologies.. I just briefly looked over the html :s
[09:42:01] <robertmaxrees> different event binding syntax adam_cameron
[09:42:05] <robertmaxrees> err, adavia
[09:42:08] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete.

[09:48:37] <Bogdaniel> arthurvr, http://forceful-storms-end-29-203213.euw1-2.nitrousbox.com:4000/land_page/ you can check here the live code for what i've done :D
[09:48:53] <Bogdaniel> arthurvr, the arrow from the left works when you hover the button
[09:48:54] <Bogdaniel> :D
[09:49:17] <arthurvr> k
[09:50:20] <arthurvr> Where does the code live?
[09:50:54] <Bogdaniel> arthurvr, just view the source it's in the head tags
[09:51:00] <arthurvr> ah I see
[09:51:08] <adavia> robertmaxrees: so suppose this a element is loaded remotly. is this how event delegation should work http://jsfiddle.net/UbpS6/36/
[09:51:50] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:52:05] <robertmaxrees> $('[data-toggle="modalPic"]') needs to be a parent element that exists on pageload.
[09:53:23] <adavia> dont get it
[09:53:48] <robertmaxrees> so is everything in that fiddle loaded via ajax?
[09:54:30] <robertmaxrees> give this a read: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[09:55:00] <arthurvr> Bogdaniel: You’re just trying to add the class when the animation finished? That seems like a fairly complicated way of doing that lol
[09:55:07] <adavia> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/UbpS6/38/
[09:55:24] <adavia> thats all the content being loaded via ajax
[09:55:31] <Bogdaniel> arthurvr, well i'm jquery noob :-D
[09:56:00] <arthurvr> Bogdaniel: Let me fiddle a little better example for you. Hope I get your intention right
[09:56:13] <Bogdaniel> arthurvr, ok :-)
[09:57:19] <Bogdaniel> arthurvr, what i'm trying to do is move the arrow to the left / right ( depends on the hovering button ) then fade it out and then when i hover out the button the arrow should return back but rotated at 180deg and then when it reaches the original position to rotate back to 180deg
[09:58:07] <robertmaxrees> adavia yeah, so the issue is that you're not able to bind to things that don't exist at the time of binding.
[09:58:24] <robertmaxrees> so you need to bind to an ancestor element that does exist instead.
[09:58:29] <adavia> robertmaxrees: i guess so
[09:58:39] <robertmaxrees> did you read the documentation i sent you?
[09:58:43] <adavia> yes
[09:58:57] <robertmaxrees> okay - so what element do you load all of this content into on your page?
[09:59:42] <adavia> robertmaxrees: <div class="photo-gallery">
[10:00:01] <robertmaxrees> so then you likely want something like $('.photo-gallery').on('click', 'a[data-toggle="modalPic"]', function(event) {
[10:00:22] <robertmaxrees> assuming .photo-gallery exists on pageload.
[10:00:41] <adavia> will try that out
[10:00:59] <chillsurf> hi there. I have this code in my site http://pastebin.com/E5bjm98k whichs works both on chrome and firefox. And I also have this code http://pastebin.com/r2jYDZaw , but it only works in chrome. In firefox it jumps to anchor without scrolling, which is my problem.How can i make it work to firefox too?
[10:01:58] <arthurvr> Bogdaniel: Give me an hour but I’ll fiddle something for you ;)
[10:02:02] <Bogdaniel> arthurvr, i was playing a little with the code and i discovered what's the problem but i'm still curious how can it be done better i will learn new things :D
[10:02:10] <Bogdaniel> arthurvr, no hurry :D
[10:02:38] <adavia> robertmaxrees: when you say .photo-gallery exists on pageload you mean the content exists when is loaded right?
[10:03:55] <adavia> because all of that content exists when loaded
[10:04:13] <robertmaxrees> i mean isn't brought in by AJAX
[10:04:33] <robertmaxrees> i mean "is apart of the page's HTML, not brought in through other means"
[10:04:56] <adavia> robertmaxrees: nooowww i get it then
[10:04:57] <paulvd> for (i = 0; i < $nodays; i++) { $nodays is a variable, is this usage correct?
[10:05:07] <robertmaxrees> paulvd probably not.
[10:05:09] <adavia> robertmaxrees: yeah now it works
[10:05:15] <adavia> thanks so much dude
[10:05:17] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[10:05:43] <paulvd> ok it is
[10:06:41] <robertmaxrees> paulvd huh?
[10:06:44] <robertmaxrees> what is $nodays in this case?
[10:07:35] <paulvd> a number
[10:07:42] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you can do that.
[10:07:44] <paulvd> it's working
[10:09:44] <paulvd> i have a div with two .event class inside, how can i get 2 as the number, it has other classes as well
[10:09:55] <paulvd> is there a class count kind of
[10:10:00] <robertmaxrees> $('div').find('.event').length
[10:10:20] <AlluringMe> I am struck :/
[10:10:59] <robertmaxrees> you're struck?!
[10:11:03] <robertmaxrees> by whom?
[10:11:14] <AlluringMe> Hey robertmaxrees :D How are you???
[10:11:24] <robertmaxrees> i've been better.  you?
[10:11:30] <AlluringMe> I am great, thanks.
[10:12:01] <AlluringMe> I meant I was not able to think further. I don't know how lol
[10:12:28] <robertmaxrees> i know - i was making a joke :)
[10:12:47] <AlluringMe> Haha, okay. My code works fine for now and does all it needs.
[10:12:59] <AlluringMe> Just a small issue; it isn't looping.
[10:13:10] <AlluringMe> http://bae.net16.net/3/login_success.php
[10:13:21] <AlluringMe> UN/PWD is test/test123
[10:13:39] <robertmaxrees> a test case fiddle would be nice.
[10:13:44] <AlluringMe> Hmm
[10:13:49] <AlluringMe> its server side code
[10:13:59] <robertmaxrees> then why are you asking in #jquery ? ;)
[10:14:12] <AlluringMe> I am working on displaying it on client side
[10:14:20] <AlluringMe> I fetch values from DB sorry
[10:14:22] <robertmaxrees> but it's server-side code...
[10:14:45] <AlluringMe> robertmaxrees, lol, I am not good at explaning
[10:14:56] <robertmaxrees> so create a fiddle we can all play with :)
[10:15:02] <AlluringMe> I am rebuilding DOM on browser when the data is coming to browser
[10:15:18] <AlluringMe> If I use a fiddle CSRF errors
[10:15:41] <robertmaxrees> right - you remove the Ajax part.
[10:15:45] <robertmaxrees> just leave the relevant bits.
[10:15:50] <robertmaxrees> unless the ajax part is what's broken.
[10:16:03] <AlluringMe> Naa, all that works good for now. :)
[10:16:41] <AlluringMe> I mean AJAX, store, retrive, update etc, etc,
[10:16:47] <robertmaxrees> take a read at this, then: https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[10:16:54] <robertmaxrees> and http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[10:17:10] <AlluringMe> Okay, thanks for the pointer. Let me read em.
[10:18:51] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: can somebody help me out? This code doersnt work in firefox but works in chromehttp://pastebin.com/r2jYDZaw
[10:19:09] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[10:19:12] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: its the same code from yesterday
[10:19:26] <robertmaxrees> i barely remember what i ate for breakfast ;)
[10:19:37] <chillsurf> https://jsfiddle.net/k9abeqt2/3/
[10:19:38] <chillsurf> hahah
[10:20:00] <decx> works in ff for me
[10:20:04] <robertmaxrees> same here.
[10:20:25] <paulvd> hm how can i pass the value of "i" in a for loop into js
[10:20:33] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ paulvd
[10:20:36] <paulvd> ih php its $i
[10:20:39] <paulvd> um
[10:20:39] <robertmaxrees> bad bot
[10:20:44] <robertmaxrees> share your code yo.
[10:20:51] <robertmaxrees> hard to help when we're not sure what you're doing.
[10:20:57] <paulvd> ok
[10:21:29] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k9abeqt2/4/ a little more readable.
[10:21:44] <AlluringMe> paul_k, PHP? like this  $( '<textarea id="<?php echo $hid; ?>" + class="edit">' + "<?php echo $hcontent; ?>" + '</textarea>' ).appendTo( "#1" );
[10:22:16] <AlluringMe> I mean you get the idea, maake the adjustments
[10:22:19] <decx> unreadable
[10:22:25] <robertmaxrees> and that's not what he's asking for.
[10:22:29] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure, at least.
[10:23:02] <AlluringMe> I am lazy, but, I am sure that's how it's done. lol
[10:23:19] <robertmaxrees> they're looping in js, not php.
[10:23:28] <decx> i dont know
[10:23:44] <decx> instructions unclear echo'ed dick
[10:23:58] <paulvd> something like this > jQueryival
[10:24:04] <paulvd> eh
[10:24:05] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/za7qo3nw/2/
[10:24:23] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:24:30] <robertmaxrees> what is jQueryi supposed to be?
[10:24:42] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do here?
[10:24:45] <paulvd> the value of count > i
[10:24:55] <paulvd> so first it should be event-1, then event-2
[10:25:06] <decx> your quotes are messed up
[10:25:08] <paulvd> i tried just i also
[10:25:11] <decx> that has nothing to do with jquery
[10:25:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/za7qo3nw/3/
[10:25:15] <decx> it's just i
[10:25:20] <robertmaxrees> something here smells to me.
[10:25:24] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[10:25:42] <paulvd> a calender
[10:26:02] <robertmaxrees> how does this loop relate to that?
[10:26:18] <paulvd> um
[10:26:36] <paulvd> if there are 2 events on a day, it would assign event-1 and event-2 to those, so that i can style them...
[10:26:49] <paulvd> in a*
[10:27:15] <robertmaxrees> you should probably use your server-side to do that instead, but if you need JS, use a foreach instead of a for loop.
[10:28:17] <paulvd> hm ok
[10:28:26] <paulvd> find('.event:eq(i)') now how would i pass i into this
[10:28:40] <robertmaxrees> that's DEFINITELY code smell.
[10:28:51] <paulvd> ?
[10:28:59] <paulvd> what code smell ?
[10:29:13] <bbclover> guys my $.post turns into a $.get on code minification
[10:29:24] <robertmaxrees> paulvd first off, that's not going to find anything with the classes you were generating before.
[10:29:39] <paulvd> what ?
[10:29:41] <robertmaxrees> second, dynamically finding things like that means you're looking at things from the wrong frame of reference.
[10:30:45] <paulvd> lol ?
[10:30:55] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:31:12] <paulvd> thats what loops are for..
[10:31:39] <robertmaxrees> for loops tend to not really be what you want - if you want to enumerate over elements, use .each() instead.
[10:32:13] <paulvd> hmm that's also a good idea
[10:32:19] <paulvd> am doing a .each already
[10:32:32] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: by using this code: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k9abeqt2/4/ , it doesnt work neither in chrome nor firefox
[10:32:41] <chillsurf> i just replaced only javascript
[10:32:44] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf that works for me.
[10:32:58] <chillsurf> i know it works in fiddle
[10:33:01] <chillsurf> not in my site
[10:33:02] <paulvd> but i would try again to do server side yeah
[10:33:03] <robertmaxrees> ...
[10:33:14] <paulvd> you just gave me an idea
[10:33:24] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf any console errors or anything on your site then?
[10:33:33] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're expecting me to do if i can't see the error happen.
[10:34:00] <chillsurf> https://jsfiddle.net/k9abeqt2/5/  this one does
[10:34:06] <gremlyn> I'm attempting an $.ajax call to post data (so I can set the content type), and my passed in content is getting lost on the other end, however $.post gets the content through fine (but with the wrong content type), anyone seen this before?
[10:34:07] <chillsurf> the only change is the javascript code
[10:34:18] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf that works for me, too.
[10:34:22] <chillsurf> the /5/ link works only in chrome and the /4/ in neither of those
[10:34:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm using FF and /5/ works for me
[10:34:53] <robertmaxrees> decx confirmed it worked for them in ff as well.
[10:34:54] <Symes_Web> Not very good question: but is becoming good in php faster than javascript ?
[10:35:06] <robertmaxrees> Symes_Web flawed question ;)
[10:35:30] <chillsurf> is there a way to compare the codes of two versions in jsfiddle?
[10:35:31] <robertmaxrees> gremlyn $.post() uses $.ajax() under the hood - you may have your $.ajax() call setup wrong.
[10:35:35] <chillsurf> so i check the changes?
[10:35:49] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf you said /5/ doesn't work in FF, right?
[10:35:54] <Symes_Web> In your opinion lol
[10:35:57] <gremlyn> robertmaxrees, https://gist.github.com/Gremlyn/501be91bff82a368baa3
[10:36:05] <robertmaxrees> Symes_Web in any experienced developer's opinion.
[10:36:05] <Symes_Web> You have a gun to your head Robert
[10:36:13] <robertmaxrees> two different languages, two different purposes.
[10:36:23] <robertmaxrees> people learn different things at different rates.
[10:36:32] <Symes_Web> Do you know them both?
[10:36:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.  but i know enough other languages to know that your logic is flawed :)
[10:36:58] <Symes_Web> Lol :p
[10:37:01] <Symes_Web> What do you know?
[10:37:01] <robertmaxrees> your first programming language will always take the longest.  after that, it gets MUCH easier.
[10:37:02] <chillsurf> no i said that it works in jsfiddle, but when I am replacing the /4/ with /5/ at my site it doesnt work neither in chrome nor firefox
[10:37:24] <robertmaxrees> can you show us the site then?
[10:37:42] <chillsurf> with which code running?
[10:37:47] <chillsurf> /4/ or 5
[10:37:48] <chillsurf> ?
[10:37:49] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf the one that breaks in ff.
[10:37:53] <chillsurf> ok
[10:38:03] <robertmaxrees> gremlyn try ditching the dataType from the ajax one.
[10:38:12] <gremlyn> ok
[10:38:15] <Symes_Web> Opinions on symes.tk ? Thats a URL btw
[10:38:21] <Symes_Web> Made it a while ago
[10:38:42] <robertmaxrees> Symes_Web i'd ask in #web or a similar channel.
[10:38:53] <Symes_Web> Kk sowwy
[10:39:04] <robertmaxrees> nbd.
[10:39:24] <chillsurf> http://axia.edu.gr/email-thunderbird-additional-settings/
[10:39:28] <gremlyn> robertmaxrees, no luck
[10:39:36] <robertmaxrees> gremlyn any console errors or anything?
[10:39:40] <robertmaxrees> what "isn't working" about it?
[10:39:51] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf that works for me in FF>
[10:40:06] <chillsurf> :S ?
[10:40:17] <robertmaxrees> are you running a really out of date version or something?
[10:40:31] <gremlyn> robertmaxrees, I'm using xdebug to catch it on the other end and inspect the request, and with the post call I get the data passed through (albeit with the wrong content type), but with the ajax call I get an empty request
[10:40:36] <robertmaxrees> what about it "Doesn't work" for you, chillsurf?
[10:40:58] <robertmaxrees> gremlyn look at the client side - check your network tab and make sure you don't see anything funky there.
[10:41:16] <chillsurf> how can i delete a sites cookies and data from browser in ff like in chrome ? in chrome i use ctrl +f5
[10:41:47] <naeluh_iframe> #html
[10:41:54] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf the same way - ctrl+f5
[10:43:28] <Symes_Web> How do I join this #web channel?
[10:43:41] <Symes_Web> Im new to all this IRC stuff
[10:43:45] <robertmaxrees> Symes_Web usually by typing /join #web
[10:44:17] <gremlyn> robertmaxrees, nothing looks weird
[10:44:21] <Symes_Web> Got it
[10:44:37] <robertmaxrees> gremlyn dunno then - something seems off to me.
[10:44:51] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're properly collecting data?
[10:45:15] <gremlyn> yeah, it works fine when I switch out the ajax for post
[10:45:20] <gremlyn> and change nothign else
[10:45:45] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ check the defaults i guess?
[10:45:50] <robertmaxrees> not sure what else to poke at.
[10:46:32] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: do you see the animation smooth scrolling working on firefox?
[10:46:39] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf nope.
[10:46:51] <robertmaxrees> is that what you meant by "doesn't work"?
[10:46:54] <chillsurf> yes
[10:47:05] <robertmaxrees> that's why i kept asking what you meant by that ;)
[10:47:13] <chillsurf> i am sorry
[10:47:18] <chillsurf> if i wasnt clear
[10:47:20] <robertmaxrees> page link again?
[10:47:28] <chillsurf> http://axia.edu.gr/email-thunderbird-additional-settings/
[10:48:07] <robertmaxrees> where is the javascript for the arrow?
[10:48:28] <chillsurf> I have another script for scrolling the steps at the start of the document body. 1. & 2.   they work on both if this helps you
[10:48:53] <robertmaxrees> reread my question ;)
[10:49:30] <chillsurf> in which file?
[10:49:34] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:49:48] <chillsurf> in the cchilds-theme/js/scrolltotop.js
[10:50:15] <robertmaxrees> there's another script that looks to be overriding this code btw.
[10:51:07] <chillsurf> maybe the one i told you about. you can see it in 1. 2. steps of text and it works in both
[10:51:30] <robertmaxrees> not sure what that means but try disabling that.
[10:52:52] <chillsurf> now i disables the forst script it works
[10:53:02] <robertmaxrees> so what does that first script do?
[10:53:28] <chillsurf> Its been my first time I make a script and I didnt know that there would be a conflict. Is it possible to use both scripts?
[10:53:36] <chillsurf> the first script is about scrolling
[10:53:59] <chillsurf> but for scrolling for other items
[10:54:02] <chillsurf> not scrolltotop
[10:54:04] <chillsurf> http://pastebin.com/E5bjm98k
[11:00:40] <gremlyn> robertmaxrees, I needed to stringify one of the objects i was sending through to get it to work how i wanted
[11:24:37] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: I managed to make both code work by pasting the second code in the original script file
[11:24:56] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf yeah, the preventDefault() was part of your headache in the first one.
[11:25:03] <chillsurf> but is there a way to make them both run from the childs-theme script file?
[11:25:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest reading about what that actually does
[11:25:16] <chillsurf> I will lose my code if the theme updatezx
[11:25:19] <chillsurf> *updates
[11:28:17] <rocking777> is there a way to tell jquery to not run asynchronously.. i know in ajax request, i can tell.. but in normal execution, is there a way? Bcoz i am setting a checkbox as chcked on some event and by the time the checked gets true, it is going to else condition
[11:29:31] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: preventdefault() was not theproblem, even if I remove it the arrow doesnt work from another file
[11:30:11] <paulvd> managed to get that in php

[12:27:53] <t4nk166> Hi, for some reason this is working for Google Chrome, but it is not working for both IE and Firefox... Anyone an idea why? element.closest('.form-group');
[12:28:00] <t4nk166> element.closest('.form-group'); is the function
[12:28:20] <decx> there's something else going on
[12:28:45] <t4nk166> I dont get why it's working for google chrome but not for the other ones :/
[12:28:53] <randomguy_> is there a way to stop the execution of an event in progress?  not the bubbling, but the actual executions.  say you have a custom handler for click, and if it is double clicked the second click would cancel the previous handling.  would you have to put something on the event for it to check in its processing to know if it should end prematurely, or is there something built in?
[12:29:22] <jekt> t4nk166: still experimental https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest#Browser_compatibility
[12:29:52] <t4nk166> jekt: auch :/ didnt know that..
[12:30:04] <t4nk166> is there an alternative to closest which achieves the same, more or less?
[12:30:37] <decx> jquery closest wont have that problem
[12:31:03] <decx> it's a loop through parentNodes
[12:31:59] <t4nk166> well that's a shame :<
[12:36:07] <t4nk166> got the issue.. it was $(element).closest instead of element.closest.. stupid of me..
[12:36:35] <t4nk166> yet surprising it worked on google chrome.
[12:39:25] <BillCriswell> t4nk166: There is an element.closest, never used it though.
[12:39:46] <t4nk166> ahh.. that might explain why
[12:39:46] <BillCriswell> t4nk166: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest
[12:39:50] <decx> jquery objects aren't vanilla element
[12:39:56] <decx> s
[12:40:07] <t4nk166> yes, I forgot to mention i was using jquery
[12:40:22] <decx> the channelname does that
[13:09:48] <kokut> Hello, I included jquery 1.1 and jQuery(document).ready(function(){}); is not working on chrome, it doesn't throw any errors, works on firefox tho, dollar sign is the same, what am i missing?
[13:10:11] <robertLunch> jquery 1.1 is pretty old, but should function.
[13:10:28] <robertLunch> mind showing your code?
[13:10:46] <kokut> it works on firefox but it doesnt work in chrome :\
[13:10:50] <kokut> no errors
[13:10:58] <robertmaxrees> sounds like an invalid page then.
[13:11:01] <robertmaxrees> does it validate?
[13:11:46] <kokut> 37 errors 4 warnings
[13:11:53] <kokut> how cute
[13:12:31] <robertmaxrees> if it's bad enough, that'll cause problems.
[13:12:37] <robertmaxrees> see if $(window).load(function() {});  works correctly.
[13:14:08] <kokut> robertmaxrees: well, i added console.log('log'); inside the jQuery(document).ready(function(){}); and it worked
[13:14:21] <kokut> on chrome
[13:14:27] <kokut> the rest of the stuff is not working
[13:14:54] <kokut> works on FF tho
[13:15:01] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a bad document to me.
[13:15:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd fix those errors.
[13:15:42] <kokut> robertmaxrees: u sure that could be the cause
[13:15:55] <robertmaxrees> without actually seeing anything, probably.
[13:16:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm about 85% sure that would be the cause.
[13:16:17] <robertmaxrees> also: use a more recent version of JQ.
[13:16:26] <kokut> its going to take a lot of work to fix all of that i dont even know where to start this webste wasn't made by me
[13:16:35] <_DB> sup guys
[13:16:40] <kokut> can't, already tried and broke everything :\
[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> kokut you're going to have to put in the effort then.
[13:17:19] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you drop in v 1.8?
[13:17:21] <robertmaxrees> does that work
[13:17:23] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:17:38] <kokut> 1.8 might work, i only tried 2.1.3
[13:17:40] <_DB> im trying to unselect a option from my select form through jquery but it doesnt seem to work it unselects it and selects the first one but the option still keeps its select attr in the background
[13:17:41] <_DB>    $("#artobject").prop("selected", false);                        $("#artobject option[value='']").prop("selected","selected");
[13:17:46] <_DB> ^^thats how im doing it
[13:18:11] <_DB> woah
[13:18:16] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:18:25] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[13:20:04] <kokut> robertmaxrees: including 1.8 didn't make it work for chrome, still works on FF
[13:20:11] <robertmaxrees> same problems though?
[13:20:29] <robertmaxrees> you could probably use 1.11 or 2.1.3 with the mirate plugin and at least alleviate some usage headaches.
[13:20:48] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/npbxrkf6/2/
[13:21:13] <_DB> when you hit the clickme button the selected option should be unselected btu it doesnt happen
[13:21:21] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:21:24] <kokut> robertmaxrees: migrate?
[13:21:27] <_DB> I was htinking of using .attr() but I read it doesnt work on all browsers
[13:21:33] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: you think i can somehow make the working script from the original file we talked about before, be moved into the new js file on the themes child? and make it work?
[13:21:57] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf did you ever read about e.preventDefault() like i told you to?
[13:22:05] <chillsurf> yes
[13:22:15] <robertmaxrees> because that'll explain everything you need to know.
[13:22:16] <chillsurf> can you please send this again?
[13:22:20] <kokut> robertmaxrees: i can't see how migrate plugin would help me in this scenario
[13:22:31] <chillsurf> *** my problem is different now
[13:22:33] <robertmaxrees> kokut it won't fix this particular problem, but it'll let you use a newer JQ version.
[13:22:40] <robertmaxrees> kokut you need to fix your markup.
[13:22:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise put your stuff in a window load and pray that works.
[13:23:01] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf not really - you need to read about what preventDefault() actually does.
[13:23:05] <robertmaxrees> it's in the docs :)
[13:23:43] <chillsurf> because the script from the original file is preventing other scripts from running, I found out that I can have both at the original scripts file which is gk.scripts.js and work great. Now I need both to be moved to the childs theme folders so I dont lose both of the codes
[13:24:13] <robertmaxrees> right.  so read about what preventDefault() does and everything will make a lot more sense :)
[13:24:42] <chillsurf> its different because now I achieved having a new code in child theme, so now I need to find a way to move the original code I had before, because I dont want to keep notes on what files I changed etc.
[13:24:45] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:24:49] <robertmaxrees> it's not.  trust me.
[13:24:56] <chillsurf> i then go in every update and modify all changed files.
[13:25:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:25:05] <robertmaxrees> don;'t modify anything.  read.
[13:25:11] <chillsurf> as a rookie i thought it wwas ok. But I understand its a pita
[13:25:14] <chillsurf> ok
[13:25:15] <_DB> chillsurf prevenDefault prevents the default action from ahppening
[13:25:25] <robertmaxrees> it can also cause issues with other event listeners.
[13:25:30] <chillsurf> but even if I remove prevent default it doesnt work
[13:25:39] <robertmaxrees> again, please go read the docs to understand how that impacts things.
[13:25:47] <chillsurf> ok
[13:25:47] <robertmaxrees> you have it in two places in the code on that page.
[13:25:55] <chillsurf> two?
[13:26:18] <chillsurf> I have found it in smooth animation scrolling code. Just once
[13:26:29] <_DB> run a find
[13:26:44] <kokut> robertmaxrees: $(window).load(function() { didn't work for chrome, it did for FF tho :\
[13:26:44] <_DB> btw robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/npbxrkf6/2/ (just incase you didnt see it lol )
[13:26:44] <robertmaxrees> check out the events bound to that button.  i recall there being three listeners on it.
[13:26:51] <kokut> robertmaxrees: anything else i can try?
[13:26:52] <robertmaxrees> kokut then you have another problem.
[13:26:56] <robertmaxrees> fix your markup.
[13:27:01] <robertmaxrees> check your console, etc.
[13:27:09] <robertmaxrees> _DB yeah i'm in the middle of a code review.
[13:27:11] <robertmaxrees> i'll do it in a second.
[13:27:23] <_DB> all good thanks bud appreciate it
[13:27:34] <kokut> robertmaxrees: the console doesn't show any errors
[13:27:38] <robertmaxrees> what exactly is the issue with yours again, _DB
[13:27:48] <robertmaxrees> kokut make sure jquery is actually loading before your code?
[13:28:02] <robertmaxrees> i can't divine a solution for you woithout seeing it in action, kokut
[13:28:07] <robertmaxrees> guessing games are never fun :)
[13:28:43] <kokut> robertmaxrees: if it wasnt loading before my code how it would would work in FF but not in chrome? also console.log('asd'); inside the document.ready is working
[13:28:52] <robertmaxrees> kokut then i don't know dude.
[13:29:03] <robertmaxrees> how do you expect me to know what the issue is without seeing any code?
[13:30:42] <robertmaxrees> _DB http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/npbxrkf6/4/
[13:35:12] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: so as I understand from the documentation, i should add e.prevent default() to my code so it works
[13:35:20] <chillsurf> right?
[13:35:35] <robertmaxrees> what does adding it actually do in the code?
[13:36:21] <robertmaxrees> (link to the page again pls)
[13:37:20] <robertmaxrees> try this - put a console.log('hello'); as the first line of code the the arrow click dealio.
[13:37:22] <robertmaxrees> what happens?
[13:37:28] <robertmaxrees> when you try to click it i mean.
[13:37:44] <_DB> robertmaxrees sorry was taking a vape break lol
[13:38:23] <_DB> but its still not working
[13:38:31] <kokut> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/s7ezgurq/
[13:38:38] <_DB> for some reason the select is still keeping the selected value
[13:38:43] <robertmaxrees> _DB try http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/npbxrkf6/5/
[13:39:26] <robertmaxrees> kokut is this broken in the fiddle?
[13:39:33] <robertmaxrees> because that code looks functional.
[13:40:08] <kokut> robertmaxrees: its broken when i try if ($.cookie('wantscookies') == 'yes'){
[13:40:17] <_DB> still doesnt work lol -_-
[13:40:21] <robertmaxrees> broken how, kokut?
[13:40:27] <robertmaxrees> _DB in the fiddle or on your site?
[13:40:35] <_DB> my site
[13:40:36] <robertmaxrees> _DB what browser?  "doesn't work" meaning...?  etc.
[13:40:39] <kokut> robertmaxrees: probably because i didn't include the jquery cookie library
[13:40:45] <robertmaxrees> _DB okay so it works in the fiddle?
[13:40:53] <robertmaxrees> _DB what version of jquery are you using on your site?
[13:41:01] <robertmaxrees> are you getting any console errors?
[13:41:16] <_DB> 1.11 and it still keeps the selected attribute im guessing I have to iterate through and remove it?
[13:41:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:41:34] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need to at least.
[13:41:35] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: i added the code console.log('hello'); at the beginning of my scrolltotop.js file but i dont see any change. I also have added e.preventdefault to the same file
[13:41:35] <kokut> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/s7ezgurq/1/ there
[13:41:37] <chillsurf> http://axia.edu.gr/email-thunderbird-additional-settings/
[13:41:41] <_DB> visually it selects another value, but when I submit it, it shows its still selected
[13:43:31] <robertmaxrees> _DB try this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/npbxrkf6/6/
[13:43:53] <robertmaxrees> kokut okay - so how is this fiddle broken?
[13:44:11] <kokut> robertmaxrees: i dont see it broken man you asked to see my code
[13:44:21] <robertmaxrees> kokut what isn't it doing that it should?
[13:44:38] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf you need jQuery('.scrollToTop').click(function(e){
[13:44:45] <kokut> that same code on my website works on FF but it doesnt work in chrome
[13:44:54] <robertmaxrees> or remove the e.preventDefault() since the return false; takes care of that.
[13:45:04] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: in what file?
[13:45:13] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf scrolltotop.js
[13:45:30] <robertmaxrees> kokut i'm looking at this in both browsers and they operate identically right now.
[13:45:50] <kokut> robertmaxrees: but not when its on my site
[13:46:00] <robertmaxrees> can you show me your site?
[13:46:10] <robertmaxrees> i don't kjnow how you expect me to help you when i cannot see the bug in action....
[13:46:28] <paulvd> robertmaxrees: how many times you have to repeat that sentence? :D
[13:46:53] <robertmaxrees> kokut so how do I replicate, since you PMed me the link.
[13:46:57] <robertmaxrees> how do I trigger the bug?
[13:47:14] <kokut> access the website through FF and then chrome and see the difference
[13:47:26] <robertmaxrees> they look identical to me.
[13:47:46] <kokut> there should be a "TEST" at the top of the page?
[13:47:56] <robertmaxrees> ah i see that now.
[13:48:44] <robertmaxrees> try $('#cookies').show(); instead of $('#cookies').removeProp('style');
[13:49:06] <kokut> k
[13:49:14] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work, try $('#cookies').removeAttr('style');
[13:49:54] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: i added e.preventdefault and  jQuery('.scrollToTop').click(function(e){ and still the same. i get hello though
[13:50:23] <kokut> robertmaxrees: it worked man, ty
[13:50:37] <kokut> why tho?
[13:51:27] <robertmaxrees> removeProp() and chrome probably don't agree.
[13:51:50] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf as far as i can tell, your smooth scroll plugin is what's causing your problems.
[13:52:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd extend that to handle your scroll to top arrow.
[13:52:26] <robertmaxrees> looks like you've already modified it anyway.
[13:52:30] <kokut> robertmaxrees: ty
[14:02:57] <varrg> what's a good plugin for a mobile-like sidemenu (the one used on mobile apps)
[14:03:06] <varrg> with the triple = sign to toggle its visibility
[14:03:19] <robertmaxrees> that's called a "hamburger icon" fwiw :)
[14:03:33] <_DB> robertmaxrees it works thanks lol forget to  reply
[14:03:46] <robertmaxrees> http://www.berriart.com/sidr/ varrg
[14:03:51] <robertmaxrees> tons of choices out there.
[14:05:18] <varrg> yeah, I am using sidr atm, but it won't drag to open
[14:13:42] <adavia> is there any other reason why i always get an empty input value other than having duplicates names?
[14:13:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:15:49] <adavia> robertmaxrees: like if i do 'detail': $('input[name=detail]').val() i always get an empty value
[14:18:53] <BinaryKitten> adavia - do you have multiple inputs with the same name?
[14:22:09] <adavia> BinaryKitten: nop.. i have already checked that
[14:35:36] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: how can I replace "(jQuery(this).scrollTop() < 1000)" so that its always 20% over the end of the page?
[14:45:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:45:45] <robertmaxrees> also: there are plenty of other people in here: one of them might know ;)
[14:46:12] <robertmaxrees> adavia $('input[name=detail]').val() will get the value of the "first" input with that name.
[14:46:18] <robertmaxrees> you need to only use each name once.
[14:50:29] <kokut> robertmaxrees: hey man i'm sorry to bother you again but u know why $.cookie("wantscookies", 'yes', { expires : 31 }); might work on FF but not in chrome? :\
[14:50:43] <robertmaxrees> are you having the same issue as before?
[14:50:55] <kokut> robertmaxrees: only that
[14:51:06] <kokut> robertmaxrees: it works on FF
[14:51:17] <robertmaxrees> how have you verified?
[14:51:26] <kokut> robertmaxrees: i deleted the cookie in chrome, could that be blocking it for being set again?
[14:51:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:53:04] <kokut> i'm trying to set a cookie using the jquery cookie plugin
[14:53:09] <kokut> it was working
[14:53:17] <kokut> now its not working anymore on chrome
[14:53:28] <robertmaxrees> how are you verifying it in chrome?
[14:53:50] <kokut> it just keeps popping up the notice
[14:54:48] <robertmaxrees> have you tried console.log()'ing out the cookie value?
[14:55:26] <kokut> robertmaxrees: it works now
[14:55:39] <robertmaxrees> lol okay
[14:55:48] <kokut> robertmaxrees: forgot to upload the last changes to the file, sry
[14:55:54] <robertmaxrees> always something simple.
[14:57:04] <adavia> robertmaxrees: didnt realize about that
[14:57:17] <robertmaxrees> the docs tell you :)
[14:58:05] <adavia> the thing is that all inputs have different names
[14:58:20] <robertmaxrees> wait what
[14:58:33] <sunscript> Can sizzle selector engine select all elements that got not a specific css property?
[14:58:42] <sunscript> Is that possible? Also performance-wise?
[14:58:56] <robertmaxrees> sunscript nope.
[14:59:14] <robertmaxrees> sunscript you can use filter though.
[15:00:04] <sunscript> robertmaxrees: a filter, a sizzle filter?
[15:00:07] <sunscript> and how fast would this be?
[15:00:13] <sunscript> will it let the page hang for minutes?
[15:00:52] <robertmaxrees> not sizzle.
[15:00:55] <robertmaxrees> .filter()
[15:00:56] <robertmaxrees> the jquery method.
[15:01:03] <robertmaxrees> and it entirely depends.  what are you trying to do?
[15:09:02] <sunscript> I use a hyphen polyfill (hypher) but it is very aggressive, I want to be able to prevent it being applied where I set hyphens: none (as in real life).
[15:09:13] <sunscript> chrome doesn't support hyphenations
[15:09:33] <robertmaxrees> erm.  that's a really risky thing to do.
[15:11:36] <sunscript> yes
[15:13:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not a polyfill.
[15:13:51] <robertmaxrees> just follow this: http://html5please.com/#hyphens
[15:16:54] <sunscript> oh damn
[15:21:04] <sunscript> https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator/blob/wiki/en_PublicAPI.md#void-hyphenatorconfigobject-settings
[15:21:18] <sunscript> But this cannot be configured to skip hyphen: none elements?
[15:22:58] <user_corrupt> I was using the following two JS scripts on a page, which dynamically load values via PHP… someone (a professional) told me that I really must load the scripts from external .js files, and then load the values from a means such as AJAX… I've created the external script to load, and I am now trying to figure out how to use jquery and $.ajax to do what apparently needs to be done.. can someone please give a tip as to how to start to figure out how to 
[15:22:58] <user_corrupt> this?
[15:23:08] <user_corrupt> http://pastie.org/10055952
[15:24:16] <robertmaxrees> sunscript i have no idea.  have you read the docs?
[15:25:13] <robertmaxrees> user_corrupt what is noCount and yesCount?
[15:25:21] <robertmaxrees> are those the vars ytou're trying to pull from your server?
[15:25:37] <sunscript> yes
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> same with the percents?
[15:27:02] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: yeah, here is the PHP that I had placed above those two .js scripts in my index.php: http://pastie.org/10056087
[15:27:08] <robertmaxrees> i don't know PHP :)
[15:27:09] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/pkt66yo/
[15:27:12] <robertmaxrees> so first you start here.
[15:27:31] <robertmaxrees> create actual functions that you can call that'll pass those values.
[15:28:13] <robertmaxrees> now you need to call these using $.ajax() - you'll need to setup an endpoint that returns a JSON object of the data you care about.
[15:29:24] <robertmaxrees> though i'm wondering why they said ajax.  do you need to run this code after the page loads?
[15:30:27] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: AJAX was one of three suggested options that "felt" the least inttimidaing to me.. I only need to run the code on page load
[15:30:39] <robertmaxrees> no need to use AJAX in this case.
[15:30:49] <robertmaxrees> what were the other options?.
[15:31:06] <user_corrupt> 1) ajax, 2) html data- attributes, 3) a <script type="application/json"> block that you parse from JS
[15:33:03] <robertmaxrees> you could also do a normal <script type="text/javascript"> block that has an object in it that's like window.myData = {noPercent: 50, noCount: 1501234124}, etc.
[15:33:09] <robertmaxrees> then just read that when running the functions.
[15:35:08] <user_corrupt> Hmm, I wish I understood. Would it be bad to use AJAX?
[15:35:17] <robertmaxrees> it makes no sense to use ajax in this case.
[15:35:23] <chillsurf> Is this possible?  elseif ((jQuery(window).width() < 940)&&(jQuery(window).width() > 140)) {http://pastebin.com/8RjCc0d1It seems something goes wrong when I try to add multiple logical operators in elseif. When I leave just if, it works
[15:35:45] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf is "else if"
[15:35:48] <robertmaxrees> two words
[15:36:51] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: did you just describe a way to pass arguments when including the scipt in my header? Is that where I can put the lines of PHP?
[15:37:05] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:37:16] <user_corrupt> oh, ok
[15:37:17] <robertmaxrees> let me try to illustrate
[15:37:17] <user_corrupt> heh
[15:37:32] <robertmaxrees> what your dev was trying to tell you is that you shouldn't be generating code.
[15:37:36] <robertmaxrees> which is a samrt thing.
[15:37:38] <robertmaxrees> *smart
[15:39:52] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/pkt66yo/#url=3a0t5k9
[15:40:04] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the PHP for that would look like, but this is what the JS would end up looking like.
[15:42:27] <user_corrupt> I see, so would entering the actual values from the database entail editing lines 1-8 of your code?
[15:42:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah, where you see those numbers now you'd fill in with data from your PHP.
[15:44:34] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: thanks a lot man
[15:44:44] <robertmaxrees> fsho - does that make a little more sense?
[15:44:50] <robertmaxrees> do you get what your dev was trying to show you?
[15:47:16] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: playing with it now to see if I can get it to work. I think it may sink in better after that
[15:48:29] <adavia> so now i see when i console.log($('input[name=description]')); i get an array of 3 input and the second one have the value i need
[16:14:55] <robertmaxrees> adavia you can't repeat names.
[16:21:01] <adavia> robertmaxrees: right i get that part, but i changed the name of the input with something unique and still shows an array of 3 inputs input.form-control
[16:21:15] <adavia> kinda weird
[16:21:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:21:44] <robertmaxrees> with that class selector or the class+attribute selector?
[16:23:30] <adavia> robertmaxrees: [input.form-control, input.form-control, input.form-control, prevObject: jQuery.fn.init[1], context: document, selector: "input[name=detail]", jquery: "1.11.2", constructor: function…]
[16:23:59] <robertmaxrees> then there are multiple inputs with that name.,
[16:24:47] <adavia> input[name=detail] is unique
[16:24:58] <robertmaxrees> if it's returning multiple inputs, it's not.
[16:27:53] <adavia> now i tried adding an id and its still not grabbing the value
[16:27:55] <adavia> =/
[16:28:09] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:28:21] <robertmaxrees> because that input is getting duplicated.
[16:28:37] <robertmaxrees> are you changing it in a template file somewhere?
[16:29:02] <adavia> robertmaxrees: its a form im loading it via ajax
[16:29:17] <robertmaxrees> any server-side templating or anything like that?
[16:29:22] <adavia> nop
[16:29:23] <robertmaxrees> is the ajax code loading it multiple times?
[16:29:29] <adavia> ohh well yes
[16:29:39] <robertmaxrees> that will cause your problems then.
[16:30:26] <adavia> make sense
[16:30:46] <adavia> im really stupid i didnt realize im rendering the form in a for loop
[16:30:59] <robertmaxrees> that's not stupid, just something to pay attention to :)
[16:35:06] <drei> hi, any idea why hide(); causes the first tab to collapse when scrolling on a mobile phone - https://jsfiddle.net/dq304adz/8/
[16:37:06] <guzzlefry> Is anyone using jquery-file-upload?
[16:37:22] <guzzlefry> I need to somehow prevent it from queuing files. :/
[16:37:47] <drei> robertmaxrees: any idea?
[16:38:22] <robertmaxrees> first off: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dq304adz/11/
[16:38:40] <robertmaxrees> second off: i don't see you using hide() in your fiddle.
[16:38:59] <robertmaxrees> drei ^
[16:39:43] <drei> :)
[16:39:52] <robertmaxrees> actually more like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dq304adz/12/
[16:40:15] <adavia> umm
[16:40:15] <robertmaxrees> but i don't see where your issue is since you don't have a .hide() anywhere in your code.
[16:40:18] <drei> sorry here is updated one - https://jsfiddle.net/dq304adz/10/
[16:40:46] <adavia> so this is the issue http://jsfiddle.net/3L6vrnLn/
[16:41:27] <robertmaxrees> drei https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dq304adz/13/ :)
[16:41:30] <robertmaxrees> thgat's what your code is doing.
[16:41:53] <robertmaxrees> adavia yuou really need to stop using duplicate IDs and Names.
[16:41:58] <robertmaxrees> that's going to cause nothing but headaches for you.
[16:42:22] <kevin> hey guys. i have a selector by class for a collection of <options> ... the parent select has multiple options matching my critera, but i only want the first one that matches for each select. how can i accomplish this? :first doesn't work as it returns just one, the first OPTION out of all the SELECTs. i need the first OPTION that matches for all SELECTs... any idea? and :first-child wont work because the option may not be the first child o
[16:42:22] <kevin> f the select
[16:42:44] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ kevin
[16:42:44] <b-ot> kevin: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:42:49] <adavia> robertmaxrees: yes sure
[16:42:55] <kevin> yeah was just thinkin that 1s
[16:43:09] <robertmaxrees> adavia issues like what you're facing right now.
[16:43:17] <robertmaxrees> it's not valid markup, so you're going to end up fighting it forever.
[16:43:50] <drei> thank you robertmaxrees!!
[16:45:17] <drei> robertmaxrees: is that a better way of writting  $(window).resize(function () {
[16:45:53] <robertmaxrees> drei resize event listeners (like scroll event listeners) are costly, so reducing the amount of work they do is always smart.
[16:47:56] <drei> the way I had it before was also giving some responsive issues when at the different screen sizes, I will deploy your fix and see if it fixes it
[16:48:19] <robertmaxrees> this won't necessarily fix everything, but it might fix a few minor issues.
[16:48:39] <robertmaxrees> also: be aware that most people won't resize their browser like that after pageload.
[16:49:07] <drei> which is the event listeners in this case?
[16:49:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:51:23] <drei> true that
[16:51:51] <drei> I meant which are the event listeners in this code?
[16:52:15] <drei> you mean the function?
[16:52:35] <drei> sorry, probably stupid question for most of you out there
[16:52:43] <robertmaxrees> i mean $(window).resize()
[16:52:44] <kevin> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/3svy52wx/ ... basically im getting bcfg but i only want bf
[16:52:46] <robertmaxrees> that's the listener
[16:52:47] <drei> still learning this stuff
[16:52:55] <kevin> (the first matching option in each select)
[16:53:09] <robertmaxrees> drei the function you pass to that resize() bit is the handler.
[16:54:39] <robertmaxrees> kevin this'll require a little more effort on your behalf.
[16:55:13] <kevin> do i gotta change it to like, loop through each select instead and do :first inside there?
[16:55:22] <kevin> that is the worst explanation i have ever given for anything
[16:55:34] <robertmaxrees> first question is why you're duplicating values in the first place.
[16:56:04] <kevin> its not values, it's something else. i just made a trivial example.
[16:56:12] <drei> thanks mate, you're a legend!
[16:56:18] <robertmaxrees> what's the something else, kevin?
[16:56:28] <robertmaxrees> does each group really have the same class surrounding it?
[16:56:49] <kevin> each select has the same class, and it's some data on the option
[16:57:07] <kevin> that is linked (provided?) on other areas of the form
[16:57:19] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[16:57:24] <kevin> so i just had to make it a trivial example, but basically the .filter() returns multiple
[16:57:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you don't want filter in this case.
[16:57:41] <robertmaxrees> becuyase your markup is kind of sideways.
[16:58:40] <robertmaxrees> so youy'd need to select off the value for some attribute i'm guessing?
[16:58:45] <robertmaxrees> this just seems so convoluted.
[17:02:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3svy52wx/2/ this could work, though it's obviously kind of a hack.
[17:03:30] <kevin> yeah thats what i thought
[17:03:43] <kevin> by "loop through each select instead" but
[17:04:07] <robertmaxrees> this really sounds like a funky markup problem to me, but meh.
[17:39:51] <Caspan> wondering if someone can help me with a wordpress and what i think is a jquery issues.
[17:39:58] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Caspan
[17:39:58] <b-ot> Caspan: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:39:59] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:40:02] <Caspan> I have a page http://llfa.ca/courses/standard-first-aid/ if you go there on desktop i get an error
[17:40:23] <Caspan> says fixedHeader does not exist
[17:40:33] <robertmaxrees> you're not loading it in time.
[17:40:35] <Caspan> but if i resize the browser so its in mobile view
[17:40:43] <Caspan> then it works fine
[17:41:06] <Caspan> curious why its erroring out only when the screen is of a certain size
[17:41:33] <Caspan> it should create tabs and accordion the page
[17:41:38] <robertmaxrees> var wwd = jQuery(window).width(); if( wwd > 999 ){ }
[17:41:52] <robertmaxrees> because it only runs that code when the page is more than 999px wide
[17:42:45] <Caspan> Uncaught ReferenceError: fixedHeader is not defined
[17:42:49] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:42:50] <Caspan> im getting that error though
[17:42:54] <robertmaxrees> you don't have that plugin loaded.
[17:43:17] <Caspan> what plugin loaded?
[17:43:23] <robertmaxrees> fixedHeader
[17:43:27] <robertmaxrees> that's not a nativepart of jquery
[17:43:41] <Caspan> why does it work when the page is small then?
[17:43:44] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't.
[17:43:48] <robertmaxrees> that code just doesn't run.
[17:43:56] <Caspan> okay resize it small
[17:43:59] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:44:02] <robertmaxrees> and the error goes away.
[17:44:06] <Caspan> see how you have the acordians
[17:44:06] <robertmaxrees> because the code does not run in that case.
[17:44:18] <Caspan> then i can stretch it and the tabs show up
[17:44:23] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:44:28] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with the error.
[17:45:05] <Caspan> humm
[17:45:09] <robertmaxrees> okay, do this
[17:45:10] <Caspan> so jsut dont run it at all
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:45:14] <robertmaxrees> in custom.js
[17:45:24] <robertmaxrees> see where that code runs?
[17:45:27] <Caspan> becuase that seems to fix it..
[17:45:35] <Caspan> 2 seconds
[17:45:37] <robertmaxrees> slow down and listen :)
[17:46:29] <guzzlefry> Is there a way to check if a certain event is already bound to an element?
[17:46:50] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry you can use your dev tools to see event bindings.
[17:46:50] <Caspan> oh crap my teme has that in it
[17:46:59] <Caspan> theme
[17:47:05] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: I need to do it programmatically.
[17:47:11] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry why?
[17:47:19] <robertmaxrees> Caspan right.  so in custom.js you try to run fixedHeader() when the window is wider than 999px
[17:47:27] <Caspan> it errors theere then stops runnin
[17:47:40] <Caspan> i removed the fixed header from this theme along time ago
[17:47:40] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:47:43] <Caspan> shit
[17:47:45] <Caspan> thank you
[17:47:46] <Caspan> !!!!
[17:47:52] <robertmaxrees> you need to kill off lines 6-12 it looks like.
[17:48:12] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry let me guess: you're loading something or generating something and need to re-bind an event listener?
[17:48:27] <Caspan> BINGO
[17:48:31] <Caspan> thank you
[17:48:34] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[17:49:01] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to work around this jquery-file-upload plugin. It has me binding a click event every time someone adds a file, which results in multiple queued files. For whatever reason, unbinding the submit button un-queues the files. There should be a method to do this, but I can't find it. :)
[17:49:16] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:49:27] <guzzlefry> yeah, major headache
[17:49:32] <robertmaxrees> "unqueue"?
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to remove files or something?
[17:50:44] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: 1) Activate file input and add file 2) click send button 3) sends the file via ajax 4) click send button again 5) sends that same file
[17:51:15] <guzzlefry> And if I add more files, it ends up sending several post requests, one per file, unless I unbind the submit button...
[17:51:27] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to clear out files instead.
[17:52:16] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: I've search a ton to find a way to do that. No luck.
[17:52:35] <guzzlefry> It's coming down to 1) ugly hacks 2) wasting more hours searching 3) starting over with something more sane
[17:53:57] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/21312734/923919 this doens't help?
[17:54:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing lots of info on removing files out of it.
[17:54:44] <guzzlefry> afaik that only works when using the UI. I'm using the basic plugin.
[17:54:52] <guzzlefry> yeah, most of that pertains to the UI version. :/
[17:54:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to play with it.
[17:55:23] <robertmaxrees> the issue with "programatically" looking at event bindings is that you're going to end up abusing private jquery APIs
[17:56:46] <guzzlefry> I'm probably just going to fallback to PLUpload unless there's a better solution. All I really need is an icon the user can click to upload a single file, remove the file from the form, show a progress bar, and submit that file along with the rest of the form data via ajax.
[17:57:03] <guzzlefry> I don't mind building the UI, but I need a sane API to work with.
[17:57:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah something tells me you can do that with the bluimp one, but i'd have to play with it to find out.
[17:57:17] <robertmaxrees> since that sounds really trivial.
[17:57:24] <guzzlefry> You'd think so.
[17:57:54] <guzzlefry> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/jquery-fileupload/queue Look how many times the question comes up. :P
[17:58:22] <adavia> wondering whats wrong with find() here http://jsfiddle.net/24A9b/12983/
[17:58:30] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry so ... http://stackoverflow.com/a/21350286/923919 ?
[17:59:06] <robertmaxrees> adavia data is undefined.
[17:59:12] <robertmaxrees> at least in that fiddle.
[17:59:20] <robertmaxrees> what is it on your site?
[18:00:14] <adavia> same thing.. i need to grab te class
[18:00:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:02:21] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go home.
[18:08:41] <limbera> i have 4 numerical input fields that i am validating. at the moment they each need a value for the form to submit
[18:08:51] <limbera> i want to be able to say "if 1 of them has a value, then you can submit"
[18:08:56] <limbera> this i my JS at the moment: http://dpaste.com/1PC1VH4
[18:09:36] <limbera> but as you can see on line 7, if ANY of the input's are not given a positive number then it won't validate
[18:09:47] <limbera> struggling to conceptually think of how to solve this problem
[20:13:07] <adamellsworth> can this library handle simultaneous uploads initialized at different times from the same form? https://github.com/malsup/form
[20:37:33] <ezek2k4> when i get data from json how i choose someting else than value
[20:38:26] <adamellsworth> ezek2k4 keys
[20:38:32] <adamellsworth> Object.keys(someObject)
[20:39:04] <adamellsworth> var keys = Object.keys(obj); obj[keys[N]]...
[20:39:15] <adamellsworth> or just the keys: keys[N]
[20:39:20] <adamellsworth> where N is an integer
[20:41:27] <ezek2k4> ok tyvm ill try to see how to integrate that
[20:51:45] <adamellsworth> ezek2k4 if you get stuck you can use !paste to show examples and most around would be happy to help
[20:51:56] <adamellsworth> oh nvm that's on the javascript channel
[20:52:06] <adamellsworth> just paste in bpaste, jsbin, etc
[20:54:11] <ezek2k4> oki :)
[20:54:13] <ezek2k4> tyvm
[21:08:43] <ezek2k4> https://jsfiddle.net/5e29e1zq/ ok this is what im trying to do when i choose something on the select it loads data from json to make an autocomplete field
[21:09:20] <ezek2k4> but i think im missing how to get city_name  instead of value
[21:11:27] <adamellsworth> sorry, stepped away for a bit
[21:11:51] <ezek2k4> np :)
[21:12:28] <adamellsworth> and you're sure that the return of cities.php is JSON?
[21:12:34] <ezek2k4> yes
[21:12:51] <ezek2k4> [{"0":"city1","city_name":"city1"}]
[21:13:07] <adamellsworth> generally, It seems more approprate to GET before you type, so as to reduce overhead
[21:14:00] <adamellsworth> Are you able to JSON.parse() the data?
[21:14:15] <adamellsworth> otherwise I'm pretty sure it'll still be a string.
[21:14:40] <ezek2k4> hmm how i can convert it to array ? someone told me to do that
[21:14:44] <ezek2k4> just didnt know how to
[21:14:50] <adamellsworth> JSON.parse(data1);
[21:15:04] <adamellsworth> That should either convert it for you or throw an error if it's invalid JSON
[21:15:21] <ezek2k4> ill try that
[21:17:53] <ezek2k4> hmm i dont get an error on firebug but it doesnt looks to convert the field to autocomplete
[21:21:52] <adamellsworth> hmm
[21:27:29] <adamellsworth> there are a few problems right off
[21:27:42] <adamellsworth> it should be $("input#cities").on('keyup', function(){...
[21:28:08] <ezek2k4> hmm i mean when i select a country then the cities should be loaded no?
[21:28:13] <adamellsworth> and you need to delegate data1 to a $.when().then(...) so you know your data isn't null
[21:28:23] <adamellsworth> no
[21:28:37] <adamellsworth> they aren't bound to one another
[21:28:57] <adamellsworth> 'test'
[21:29:01] <adamellsworth> n'test'
[21:29:08] <adamellsworth> anyway
[21:30:20] <adamellsworth> function(data1){ should be: success: function(data1){...}
[21:30:50] <ezek2k4> k
[21:31:57] <d3m0n> Can someone tell me why the button1 isn't hiding? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZYPGOm
[21:33:08] <d3m0n> err wrong param but even with the right one still didnt work
[21:34:23] <adamellsworth> ezek2k4: https://jsfiddle.net/j4fackod/
[21:34:31] <adamellsworth> that works on text input
[21:35:08] <adamellsworth> d3m0n: $.cookie is undefined
[21:35:35] <adamellsworth> it should be $("#cookie") with <button id="cookie">
[21:35:37] <adamellsworth> etc
[21:37:27] <d3m0n> adamellsworth: err it should work like that
[21:37:36] <d3m0n> I included the script, let me double check.
[21:39:16] <d3m0n> Somethings funky on codepen
[21:39:24] <d3m0n> Doesn't give me that error
[21:39:27] <d3m0n> Local*
[21:41:13] <d3m0n> adamellsworth: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JozdbP still getting the error?
[21:42:36] <d3m0n> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JozdbP
[21:45:36] <adamellsworth> d3m0n: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/raRVWP
[21:46:23] <d3m0n> Umm
[21:46:33] <d3m0n> I think you've missed what I was trying to accomplish completely.
[21:47:10] <adamellsworth> well your scope is all wrong, it needs a variable
[21:47:27] <d3m0n> Doc Read -> Check if Cookied Saved -> Show or Hide Load, Click Save -> Saves Cookie, Displays Load
[21:47:28] <d3m0n> How so?
[21:47:38] <d3m0n> I am following the docs
[21:47:43] <adamellsworth> what docs?
[21:47:49] <d3m0n> https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[21:47:58] <d3m0n> $.cookie('name', 'value');
[21:48:15] <adamellsworth> oh, that lib isn't available in codepen
[21:48:22] <adamellsworth> you need to inject it
[21:48:38] <d3m0n> I did, it's loaded in codepen via cdnjs
[21:49:43] <adamellsworth> oh my mistake
[21:50:38] <adamellsworth> console.log($.cookie('data')) === undefined
[21:50:50] <adamellsworth> not null
[21:51:14] <d3m0n> I really wish theyd say that. I read on stack is was null
[21:51:20] <adamellsworth> undefined !== null = true
[21:51:36] <adamellsworth> it's a js thing, undefined is false, null is true
[21:51:51] <adamellsworth> in this case
[21:52:05] <adamellsworth> technically it's 'falsey' which is a terrible word for false
[21:52:46] <adamellsworth> typeof(null) = object, so yeah
[21:53:03] <adamellsworth> ezek2k4 did that help?
[21:53:45] <adamellsworth> sorry for going off the deep end there d3m0n, i wasn't really looking at the intent of the functions
[21:58:19] <drei>  Need to change span class glyphicon-plus" to span class glyphicon-minus on the active li that has tab-content appended to it - https://jsfiddle.net/s3t6b6L2/1/
[21:59:10] <d3m0n> No problem adamellsworth, thanks for pointing that out but I still don't seem to be getting it right. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JozdbP
[22:00:15] <drei> -ie. trying to create the effect so that it shows a plus icon on collapse and and minus icon on close
[22:01:50] <adamellsworth> drei: https://jsfiddle.net/rauq4ct8/
[22:02:01] <adamellsworth> lines 5->7
[22:02:12] <d3m0n> It's like when it loads the page, the cookie gets set
[22:02:24] <adamellsworth> drei: only half works though
[22:02:30] <drei> thanks adamellsworth
[22:02:43] <drei> true
[22:02:45] <adamellsworth> if you click others while other's are open the other's close
[22:03:12] <drei> yep can see that
[22:03:28] <adamellsworth> which you need to do something like $('li').find('span:not(.thisSpansClass)').toggleClass(..)
[22:03:38] <adamellsworth> or i think jq has a .not() func
[22:04:28] <adamellsworth> and would probably be better spent on the parent id/class
[22:05:19] <drei> hmm not sure
[22:05:22] <adamellsworth> drei: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21166892
[22:05:28] <adamellsworth> .closest()
[22:07:30] <drei> adamellsworth where would I insert that?
[22:07:44] <drei> sorry pretty new to this stuff
[22:11:18] <drei>  
[22:13:01] <drei> adamellsworth you mean before declaring the enableTabs function?
[22:13:26] <adamellsworth> oh
[22:14:57] <adamellsworth> it's like checking closest('li').is('active', function () {...})
[22:15:29] <adamellsworth> oh wait, i think that's bad
[22:15:35] <adamellsworth> the same logic though
[22:16:09] <adamellsworth> if ($(this).closest('li').is('active')) {...}
[22:17:26] <drei> adamellsworth do you mind updating the fiddle?
[22:21:50] <drei> what I need I need to put ($(this).closest('li').is('active')) {...} in an if statment?
[22:22:03] <drei> *would not &what
[22:22:08] <drei> *what
[22:22:35] <drei> adamellsworth
[22:24:14] <se_busca_ayuda> Hi, I’m trying to implement JQuery with famo.us and i’m trying to implement a simple autocomplete box. It’s not working. Here’s my code: http://hastebin.com/sacamoloca.xml
[22:24:57] <Uhkis> se_busca_ayuda: you're missing # in front of autocom
[22:25:43] <Uhkis> se_busca_ayuda: $('#autocom').autocomplete
[22:26:08] <adamellsworth> drei: sorry, my boss is on me to get a feature fixed atm
[22:26:42] <drei> ok, no worries
[22:27:46] <se_busca_ayuda> Uhkis: OMG thank you
[22:30:16] <Uhkis> i wouldn't use that famo.us, their website is full of js errors :D
[22:30:24] <drei> Need to change span class glyphicon-plus" to span class glyphicon-minus on the active li that has tab-content appended to it. - https://jsfiddle.net/s3t6b6L2/1/
[22:30:52] <drei> use this fiddle instead - https://jsfiddle.net/rauq4ct8/1/
[22:31:43] <drei> half way there although when clicking on multiple tabs, not getting the desired effect
[22:44:00] <Uhkis> drei: https://jsfiddle.net/rauq4ct8/2/
[22:44:43] <drei> legend, thank you so much Uhkis!!!
[22:45:24] <Uhkis> np :)
[22:46:48] <drei> thanks again
[22:47:09] <Uhkis> that's what we're here for!
[22:48:01] <drei> actually Ukkis when you click on the active one again...it should show plus not minus
[22:48:53] <drei> sorry Misspelled Uhkis
[22:49:17] <drei> can you see what I mean Uhkis?
[22:49:27] <Uhkis> and do nothing else..?
[22:49:39] <drei> what you mean?
[22:50:15] <Uhkis> oh you mean it's reversed
[22:50:50] <drei> the above is not working when you close the current one you close
[22:51:03] <drei> the one that you are clicking
[23:00:52] <drei> any idea Uhkis?
[23:05:43] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/rauq4ct8/4/
[23:06:59] <guzzlefry> Is there something like .serialize() and .serializeArray() that generates an object instead?
[23:07:01] <drei> Uhkis absolute legend, thanks mate!
[23:15:39] <se_busca_ayuda> How do i include jquery into my .js files?
[23:16:41] <Uhkis> just include jquery before your other .js files in the html
[23:18:44] <se_busca_ayuda> uhkis so the html file will make it globally available to all subsequent .js files?
[23:19:57] <Uhkis> se_busca_ayuda: yes
[23:23:08] <adavia> this is weird
[23:24:05] <adavia> like im loading some remote content and it seems to overlap each time it loads
[23:31:50] <se_busca_ayuda> Can i extend jquery widget functionality to famo.us objects?
