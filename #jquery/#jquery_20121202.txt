[00:22:52] <Ghelere> Hello
[00:31:01] <Petazz_> Hi how can I use the basic dom creation to create strings?
[00:32:12] <nightfly_> document.createTextNode(string_here)
[00:32:16] <Petazz_> like element.innerHTML = $('<img />') but that ends up with [element]
[00:32:40] <Petazz_> or actually [Object]
[00:33:12] <Petazz_> So jQuery-objects don't have any function like toHTMLstring?
[00:33:53] <tw2113> ?html
[00:33:54] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[00:34:16] <tw2113> example, that actually sets the html, instead of gets
[00:34:17] <tw2113> $("div").html("<span class='red'>Hello <b>Again</b></span>");
[00:34:57] <Petazz_> Yea so $('<img />').html -> ""
[00:35:21] <Petazz_> What I would need is $('<img />').smthng() -> "<img />"
[00:35:39] <tw2113> $('div').html('<img/>');
[00:36:08] <tw2113> or $('body').html('<img/>');
[00:36:11] <Petazz_> But the I lose the benefits of the basic structure
[00:36:29] <Petazz_> so that was only an example, of course my img-html is a lot more :P
[00:37:21] <rue> Well, that’s too bad. Now you just have to use it
[00:37:52] <Petazz_> Hmm ok so there is no way to directly get an object as a string?
[00:38:04] <Petazz_> The only real way to do that is via appendTo()?
[00:43:21] <Petazz_> Well the manual way seems always better..
[00:46:06] <rue> Petazz_: ‘Get an object’ == get a new object?
[00:50:09] <Petazz_> rue: So in the essence I'm trying to dynamically create HTML and create part of it as string and part of it with jquery
[00:50:30] <Petazz_> But it seems that the only way to use the jquery-objects is to append those to an element
[00:50:43] <Petazz_> I cannot get them as text so I could just + them
[00:51:00] <tw2113> obj.part
[00:51:35] <tw2113> console.log the object to see what all is inside it, and use string notation to get to the individual parts
[00:53:59] <rue> Could you maybe do the trick where you call a function and lose the jquery context?
[00:54:06] <rue> I don’t remember
[00:55:02] <tw2113> Petazz_, quick example that i have that opens a json file and reads it http://pastebin.com/K0WnTNdM
[00:56:14] <Petazz_> tw2113: Yea but you're not creating any dom-elements with jQuery root type
[00:56:31] <Petazz_> Well, manual is just fine =)
[00:56:43] <tw2113> not following the jquery root type oart
[00:57:16] <tw2113> you mean like document.createElement() or whatever it is?
[01:00:18] <Petazz_> tw2113: Yea, or what would you call creating an element through $('<elem />')
[01:03:26] <djQuery> durning a loop using the .each(function(){    if(somecondition){ continue}})
[01:03:47] <djQuery> does the continue work as it normaly would inside a while loop?
[01:04:16] <ravenzz> just return
[01:05:18] <tw2113> Petazz_, i wonder if this applies to more than just mobile http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a1/experiments/api-viewer/docs/jQuery/index.html#creating-new-elements
[01:05:20] <djQuery> heyya ravenzz
[01:05:34] <ravenzz> hey djQuery!
[01:06:00] <sacho_> djQuery, no, it doesn't. continue is a language construct. You are passing a function to .each() which it will execute multiple times, but once your function starts executing, there's no loop to "continue" in it
[01:06:30] <ravenzz> as I said returne false or any falsy value
[01:06:47] <ravenzz> -e
[01:07:50] <sacho_> you mean return a non-falsy value.
[01:07:52] <tw2113> in those conditions, do console.log('you look very nice today'); return;
[01:07:54] <sacho_> returning a falsy value breaks.
[01:08:04] <ravenzz> ..
[01:08:28] <ravenzz> it will exit from the function
[01:08:42] <sacho_> it will also break the .each() loop
[01:10:55] <ravenzz> .,,
[01:11:08] <ravenzz> sacho_ djQuery http://jsfiddle.net/hLvy4/
[01:11:53] <sacho_> sorry, not falsy, false exactly.
[01:12:02] <ravenzz> ..
[01:12:06] <sacho_> http://jsfiddle.net/hLvy4/1/
[01:12:29] <ravenzz> wrong
[01:12:30] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/hLvy4/2/
[01:12:41] <sacho_> null is not false
[01:12:47] <ravenzz> is falsy
[01:12:48] <ravenzz> dude.
[01:12:59] <sacho_> <sacho_> sorry, not falsy, false exactly.
[01:13:02] <ravenzz> actually return; would return undefined still falsy
[01:13:04] <sacho_> *sigh*
[01:13:55] <ravenzz> actually I think that it doesn't matter what you return. It will go to the next iteration
[01:14:04] <sacho_> It does. Did you even look at my update?
[01:15:02] <ravenzz> oh yes sure. false = break, other falsy/true = continue
[01:25:18] <Petazz_> tw2113: Hmm that doesn't help me either
[01:41:49] <Heather_> question what is the difference between responseJSON and $.parseJSON ? I'm using this plugin that has responseJSON as an argument in the callback function. Dont you have to parse the json before you can access the values?
[01:48:49] <chid> What's an alternative way to do $('p span') using $('p')?
[01:49:35] <ravenzz> ?find @ chid
[01:49:36] <bot-t> chid, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[01:49:44] <chid> Thanks!
[01:49:47] <chid> that's perfect
[01:49:53] <ravenzz> yw
[02:37:14] <aqeel> ok guys any one knows about custom scrolling
[02:57:04] <jessica> how can i add an input field via jquery in this code at the place of <td>abc</td> - http://jsfiddle.net/gKJEs/7/
[03:57:23] <tintin> Anybody there? Can i ask now about .ajax() ?
[03:58:52] <tintin> ?
[04:06:34] <tintin> Anybody there? Can i ask now about .ajax() ?
[04:19:15] <tintin> Anybody there? Can i ask now about .ajax() ?
[04:20:07] <tintin> What is data: in .ajax() ?
[04:27:04] <ejo> don't ask to ask, just ask
[04:27:06] <ejo> ;)
[04:27:25] <ejo> the 'data' property in .ajax() is the data to send to the server
[04:28:46] <ejo> it typically points to a javascript object, a hash of keys and values, or bunch of json... depending on what type of request and content-type you need to do
[04:30:00] <ejo> the most common content of 'data' in .ajax() is for a POST request, a hash of keys and values which are converted to POST params.
[04:32:36] <jessica_> need 1 small help here- http://jsfiddle.net/gKJEs/11/
[04:32:52] <jessica_> how do i add a simple placeholder value to my textfield ????
[04:33:21] <jessica_> any1 there ??
[04:37:20] <jessica_> no1 there ??
[04:39:49] <ejo> which text field?
[04:40:01] <ejo> the input?
[04:41:08] <ejo> just use the placeholder attribute... assuming you're in HTML5
[04:58:19] <dns-away> can I using two times on one page datepicker with different class names and how ?
[04:59:21] <dns-away> onSelect make changes on first input only.
[05:06:52] <veQue> when i click on a text field i want it to addClass(currFocus) but and that part works great.  but It loses focus when i click an onscreen button.
[05:07:28] <veQue> the button gets focus
[05:07:34] <veQue> i dont want the button to get focus
[05:08:53] <bampersand> Hey guys, I'm trying to parse JSON. my code is http://pastie.org/5466401 .. firebug GETs the document fine with 200 OK but none of the code inside function(data){.. seems to be evaluated
[05:13:20] <veQue> is there a way i can set a focusable to false?
[05:13:26] <veQue> for onscreen buttons?
[05:20:16] <Pulak> hi
[05:33:13] <michelem> hello folks
[05:34:04] <dblosevn> :-)
[05:34:10] <michelem> how can I debug why some twitter bootstrap "popover" elements are not showing up when clicked?
[05:34:56] <michelem> I use the data-attributes only referencing, i.e. I have no js to actually trigger them. They should trigger automatically.
[05:35:35] <HardDisk_WP> hey
[05:35:52] <HardDisk_WP> how do i determine if element a is a child of element b?
[05:36:00] <dblosevn> sorry, im not a bootstrap guy, ive usually found it is that data attribs being wrong that causes that tho
[05:36:26] <dblosevn> HardDisk_WP: do you have a reference to `element b` ?
[05:36:47] <dblosevn> HardDisk_WP: or do you simply want to know if it has a b tag parent?
[05:36:59] <HardDisk_WP> unfortunately not, it happens in an event handler
[05:37:23] <HardDisk_WP> I got a DOM element for element b, and the event supplies me with element a
[05:37:32] <dblosevn> HardDisk_WP: if i assume you just want to know if there is a <b> thats its parent
[05:37:46] <HardDisk_WP> yes
[05:38:11] <dblosevn> HardDisk_WP: if ($(this).closest('b').length) {
[05:38:26] <michelem> I copy-pasted the line from the twitter docs page, so I exclude that
[05:38:36] <HardDisk_WP> ah, hold short, b is not a tag, b is an element
[05:39:00] <dblosevn> HardDisk_WP: paste me an example
[05:39:10] <HardDisk_WP> hold short
[05:39:21] <dblosevn> michelem: I had issues with the dialog reference page it does not work in the bootstrap docs
[05:39:50] <dblosevn> michelem: I had to change one of the data attribs to make it happen
[05:40:03] <michelem> thanks, I'll have a look.
[05:40:22] <HardDisk_WP> dblosevn, http://jsbin.com/afusec/1/edit
[05:40:33] <HardDisk_WP> I have an eventhandler for mouseout on paintarea
[05:40:59] <dblosevn> so what exactly is b?
[05:41:03] <HardDisk_WP> and it fires when the mouse either goes over the circle (in which case I want to do nothing) or when the mouse goes over textarea (where I want to do something)
[05:41:16] <HardDisk_WP> a is paintarea, b is either circle or textarea
[05:41:28] <HardDisk_WP> (or, any other element inside paintarea)
[05:42:23] <dblosevn> if ($(this).hasClass('circle') || $(this).prop('id') == 'textarea') {
[05:43:21] <michelem> dblosevn: I missed on this note later on: "For performance reasons, the Tooltip and Popover data-apis are opt in. If you would like to use them just specify a selector option."
[05:44:01] <dblosevn> michelem: ah lol
[05:44:48] <dblosevn> michelem: I seriously did have a problem with that example though, and i almost rememeber what it was, I think the data attribs werent prefixed with data-
[05:45:17] <dblosevn> it was something stupid like that
[05:46:40] <michelem> I believe you, easy :)
[06:01:35] <michelem> what's the right syntax to express: $(my selector).tooltip() ?
[06:01:53] <michelem> essentially, I want to call .tooltip() on all the objects matched by that selector
[06:02:29] <veQue> when i do a .css and need  filepath to an image. should i assume that jquery would look through path as though it was in the css folder?
[06:04:08] <dblosevn> michelem: in jquery that is it
[06:09:57] <veQue> -_-
[06:10:13] <veQue> why do these attempts have to be so many
[06:10:18] <warbler> Can someone recommend me the greatest jQuery buttons reference known to mankind? I want to replace the tacky ones on pointstackers.com
[06:24:15] <shoky> veQue: jquery doesn't do anything with the path. its the browser that will look in the path, relative to the html page
[06:24:34] <veQue> ok thnks
[06:25:49] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/YtysX/4/ i'm trying to comprehend this code that adds two background images through css. the green and blue swatches. but i lose it at the +
[06:27:09] <shoky> veQue: the + is just string concatenation
[06:27:30] <shoky> it takes the current background-image value and adds another url to it
[06:27:47] <veQue> oh i thought the parenthises would have to encapsulate all that starting at the csss(
[06:28:04] <shoky> _oCurr.css('background-image')
[06:28:10] <shoky> that's all they need to encapsulate
[06:28:15] <shoky> taking the current css value..
[06:28:19] <shoky> then the +
[06:29:23] <veQue> so the last line is equivalent to jQuery('#element).css('background-image',   ?
[06:29:45] <shoky> uh
[06:29:51] <shoky> var _oCurr = jQuery('#element');
[06:29:58] <shoky> so.. yes?
[06:30:23] <veQue> i mean can you finish?
[06:30:32] <veQue> jQuery('#element).css('background-image',   ?
[06:30:40] <veQue> where the questionmark is
[06:30:49] <shoky> why do you need me to do it?
[06:30:53] <shoky> heard of console.log ?
[06:30:57] <veQue> well i'll do it
[06:31:03] <veQue> you can tel me if i'm right or wrong
[06:31:23] <veQue> hmm ok i'll check firebug
[06:31:28] <veQue> good clue
[06:31:43] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/YtysX/9/
[06:34:09] <veQue> thanks man. that's a good bit of help.
[06:34:28] <veQue> i see the difference now

[06:52:54] <abhinav_singh> How should I make draggable to take entire width and height of droppable  ( I basically want draggable should overlap droppable when I drag it to droppable) http://jsfiddle.net/qd8fa/
[07:18:09] <veQue> ok i got it somewhat working. i may need a break.. it keeps adding a backgroundpic everytime i click
[07:18:36] <veQue> i gotta tell it when to take it off
[07:20:52] <veQue> so many ways of tackling this problem
[07:21:03] <veQue> that's good or bad
[07:41:57] <veQue> ok how do i check to see if a element has a background pic already and if so dont add another
[07:42:27] <veQue> hmm
[07:42:31] <veQue> maybe
[07:42:42] <veQue> ok i got it
[07:43:24] <veQue> addClass and i'll have two classes ...  first class will contain one background image and the other will contain two
[07:47:17] <star_prone> Hi
[07:47:29] <star_prone> how can I change the url in the browser?
[07:47:45] <star_prone> something similar with facebook when you open a picture
[07:51:50] <veQue> Can I have #AA{ background-image: url(..images/AA.png)}  AND #AA[data-x="3"]{background-image: url(../images/AA.png), url(../images/output.png}  ?
[07:54:50] <killtheliterate> having trouble using ajaxSubmit() within jquery.validate(). Get a typeerror that states "object has no method ajaxSubmit". Any idea how to solve this?
[07:55:18] <defaultro> folks , $('#unnamed').hide() works while I am in Firebug but doesn't work when in runtime :( What's wrong?
[07:56:13] <veQue> bah
[07:56:20] <veQue> this is crazy
[08:02:44] <veQue> I have #A #B #C  default css assigns them each a picture respectively a.png b.png and c.png.  but when my data-x attribute equals 3 (data-x=3) i need to add a second background image named output.png What's the best way of doing this?
[08:03:09] <veQue> by picture i mean background-image
[08:07:07] <veQue> can i have a class called  .output{background-image: , url(secondimage.png);} using the comma to denote that i already have a previous image and not to overide it?
[08:11:14] <veQue> how to call a function when an attribute changes?
[08:15:09] <niyazpk> defaultro: what error are you getting?
[08:15:43] <niyazpk> killtheliterate: please share some sample code
[08:16:11] <killtheliterate> niyazpk: this will be embarrassing... i'd forgotten to load the jquery.form plugin
[08:16:41] <niyazpk>  i thought so. no worries...
[08:20:31] <killtheliterate> niyazpk: thanks, though
[08:22:58] <veQue> how can i go about adding a second background image to something dynamically without overiding the default background image?
[08:27:14] <Darsain> hey guys, is it perverted to include something like this in jQuery plugin? :) https://gist.github.com/4189597
[08:28:00] <Darsain> the purpose of defining everything, and not just the difference from default is to override settings someone might have in linting plugins like SublimeLinter
[08:28:53] <shoky> Darsain: what for?
[08:30:49] <Darsain> shoky: for jshinting to lower the possibility of errors and some bad practices
[08:31:10] <shoky> when other people are developing your plugin?
[08:31:23] <Darsain> yes
[08:31:29] <defaultro> niyazpk, just got back. No error but it doesn't hide the unnamed id
[08:31:48] <defaultro> i am thinking the form isn't displayed yet
[08:33:00] <shoky> Darsain: seems a bit strict to me.. such jshint declarations should be part of the automated build, not part of each individual's development-experience with the IDE warning about things they disabled in the settings
[08:33:10] <shoky> Darsain: but it's your plugin.. so .. as you wish ;p
[08:33:48] <shoky> Darsain: and as part of the automated build, you wont need to override any IDE's settings
[08:34:06] <shoky> not that i have much experience with this myself.. just my thoughts.
[08:36:24] <Darsain> shoky: in automated build? like build that would correct my typos, fix errors, and replace bad practices? :)
[08:36:34] <Darsain> this is there specifically for automatic linting while coding
[08:36:36] <shoky> no, that's what your IDE is for
[08:36:44] <shoky> using your preferred settings
[08:37:01] <defaultro> i'll be back again

[09:29:02] <veQue> \o/ I am the champion
[09:29:06] <veQue> of the world!!!

[09:30:16] <jessica> help me plz
[09:31:11] <veQue> hmm
[09:31:31] <veQue> there's like a css thing that auto adds a scrollbar
[09:31:55] <veQue> i think it's overflow
[09:32:25] <jessica> update the jsfiddle if possible
[09:32:36] <veQue> is if height == Npx add a class with the overflow thing
[09:32:48] <veQue> hmm
[09:33:06] <jessica> update the fiddle if possibole with u
[09:34:02] <danheberden> jessica: http://jsfiddle.net/gKJEs/23/
[09:34:03] <danheberden> it's just css
[09:34:57] <mbrevda> I created a function to allow a multi-select to select multiple items with a single click. Its works great, it just dose this weird jumpy thing. To try it, click '#feedback' and then scroll down and select something at the bottom. Ideas?
[09:34:58] <mbrevda> http://jsfiddle.net/gLZ3R/
[09:42:15] <veQue> jessica: yeh what danheberden said
[09:42:27] <veQue> lol i was looking for how to do it with jquery
[09:42:32] <veQue> i have a lot to learn
[09:42:57] <jessica> same here :)
[09:43:31] <veQue> yeh just put the button outside the div
[09:43:39] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/gKJEs/24/
[09:43:47] <jessica> thinkin how to do it
[09:44:29] <veQue> just click above
[09:45:01] <jessica> great it needs 1 more thing, when i add a new row it should be visible, rite now its sinking inside...the scrollbar should work in reverse order
[09:46:00] <veQue> may be someway just moveing the scrollbar to bottom on click
[09:46:20] <jessica> danheberden please guide us on this
[09:46:45] <jessica> and whats this #thing in css and how is it working on our buttons ?
[09:47:17] <danheberden> jessica: the css *should* be pretty obvious - if it isn't, i suggest working on some basic css knowledge
[09:47:26] <veQue> #thing is the selector for the id
[09:47:30] <danheberden> the div with the id "thing" has a max-height of 300px
[09:47:38] <jessica> ahh got it
[09:47:39] <veQue> look at the html part you will see id=thing
[09:47:41] <danheberden> when you exceed that, it causes overflow
[09:47:48] <danheberden> you *could* hide that with overflow:hidden
[09:48:00] <danheberden> or :auto - which adds a scrollbar if necessary
[09:48:04] <danheberden> as for scrolling
[09:48:17] <danheberden> you could get the scrollHeight of #thing
[09:48:26] <danheberden> so, say you have 500px of content inside
[09:48:31] <jessica> and how to show my last added row , right now its sinking ??
[09:48:35] <danheberden> the #thing div is 300px high
[09:48:53] <danheberden> but your scrollHeight - the hight of how far you can scroll #thing, (in this example) is 500px
[09:48:58] <danheberden> so you would a) get the scrollHeight
[09:49:03] <danheberden> and b) set the scrollTop to that height
[09:49:37] <danheberden> something like `var $thing = $('#thing'); $thing.scrollTop( $thing.prop('scrollHeight') );`
[09:49:43] <jessica> and 1 last thing, how do i post the multiple text in a mysql table
[09:49:48] <mbrevda> why dose the list scroll when the last item is selected? http://jsfiddle.net/gLZ3R/
[09:50:23] <danheberden> jessica: this is support for jQuery - we've already extended enough into CSS land :)
[09:50:52] <jessica> :) i am so thankful, no 1 is replyin in php for this :)
[09:51:03] <jessica> all enjoyin sunday
[09:51:13] <danheberden> jessica: there is so much info out there already

[10:02:28] <jerkface0> What's the easiest way to pop up an error message in jquery mobile
[10:02:50] <jerkface0> I can show up an error page as a dialog, which works good, except that it's themed just like all the other pages, there is no red or warning button or anything to signify that it's an error
[10:02:53] <jessica> i can do a form submit
[10:02:59] <jessica> in loop is what my problem is
[10:11:23] <jessica> danheberden, i added these 2 lines but still my scrollbar is goin up - http://jsfiddle.net/gKJEs/25/
[10:13:27] <danheberden> jessica: what is scrollDown?
[10:13:39] <danheberden> and why isn't your web inspector open to see the console error?
[10:13:44] <danheberden> are you using chrome?
[10:13:53] <danheberden> or firefox?
[10:13:56] <danheberden> or safari?
[10:14:00] <jessica> i am using chrome
[10:14:06] <danheberden> open those dev-tools yo
[10:14:32] <danheberden> view > developer > developer tools
[10:14:34] <jessica> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'scrollDown'
[10:14:47] <jessica> i tried scrollBottom aswell
[10:14:57] <danheberden> why are you just trying method names?
[10:15:02] <danheberden> did you look them up on api.jquery.com?
[10:15:39] <danheberden> ?manipulation @ jessica
[10:15:40] <bot-t> jessica, Docs: Manipulation - All of the methods in this chapter manipulate the DOM in some manner. A few of them simply change one of the attributes of an element (also listed in the Attributes category ), while others set an ... http://api.jquery.com/category/Manipulation/
[10:15:52] <danheberden> look for scroll type methods on that page
[10:16:05] <danheberden> (hint: there are two)
[10:16:09] <jessica> kk
[10:16:21] <danheberden> (hint2: i already typed it out above)
[10:17:46] <jessica> u typed scrollTop
[10:18:19] <jessica>  $thing.scrollTop( $thing.prop('scrollHeight') );
[10:18:32] <jessica> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'scrollHeight'
[10:19:49] <mbrevda> in case anyone is looking - my issue (of the list items jumping onclick) doesnt happen in firefox. Ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/gLZ3R/
[10:21:33] <ph88> i've read the docs but still don't quite get when to use this or what it's benefits are http://knpbundles.com/sonata-project/SonataAdminBundle
[10:23:27] <jessica> i have to use something like thing - <script>$("div.demo").scrollTop(300); </script>
[10:24:52] <jessica> something like this ?  $("div.thing").scrollTop(300);
[10:26:32] <danheberden> jessica: you have the right idea that scrollTop wants a value
[10:26:38] <danheberden> i'm concerned how you took what i typed with scrollHeight
[10:26:42] <danheberden> and somehow tried to call a method
[10:26:49] <danheberden> $thing.prop('scrollHeight')
[10:26:54] <danheberden> GETS the scrollHeight
[10:26:58] <danheberden> which should be a number
[10:27:14] <danheberden> which is, well, the scrollable height of the element
[10:28:49] <jessica> but it still is going up, http://jsfiddle.net/gKJEs/26/

[11:33:18] <peterpops1> Hi, im trying to draw som graph in my jquery mobile web app, and trying to use jqplot, but I cant get it to work. Im using  $('#pagename').live('pageshow', function() { to draw the graph, but nothing shows up. Any idea why ?
[11:35:03] <jessica> fr4nk, when i click addrow a new row is inserted and after 4 rows a scrollbar comes, but the position of scrollbar is at the top, it should be at the latest row
[11:35:28] <fr4nk> http://jsfiddle.net/gKJEs/33/
[11:35:35] <fr4nk> i added
[11:35:36] <fr4nk> $('#thing').scrollTop( $('#thing').scrollTop()+30 );
[11:35:40] <fr4nk> in click event
[11:35:49] <fr4nk> hard coded +30^^
[11:39:36] <andrew9184> who else is working on a sunday ?
[11:44:11] <fr4nk> jessica you see my fiddle? hope that helps
[11:44:34] <jessica> thats awesome just lookin at what exactly u did
[11:44:56] <abjorn> andrew9184: I suppose that depends on your definition of working.
[11:45:17] <abjorn> If by working you mean drinking and coding something completely unrelated to my work then yes.
[11:46:25] <jessica> why did u add 30 ?
[11:46:52] <fr4nk> just a guessed number of the height of the new added <tr>
[11:47:49] <abjorn> it's actually 28 pixels but 30 is close enough
[11:47:51] <abjorn> :p
[11:48:12] <fr4nk> :D
[11:48:21] <jessica> kkk thanks a lot
[11:48:50] <fr4nk> better way is to get the new heigt of the added element but $('#table').closest("tr").css('height'); is undefined :-/
[11:49:01] <jessica> fr4nk, i am left with 1 small thing n that is how to save multiple data of these rows in my mysql tabe
[11:49:19] <jessica> i can save a form
[11:49:28] <jessica> but while it comes to multiple rows, i get confused
[11:49:31] <abjorn> that's because closest() traverses up the tree, fr4nk
[11:50:29] <abjorn> you want $("#table").find("tr:last-child").height()
[11:50:57] <abjorn> or $("#table").find("tr").last().height(), whichever floats your boat
[11:50:58] <fr4nk> nice, thats better
[11:51:20] <abjorn> hm i wonder which is faster
[11:51:21] <fr4nk> so jessica change the line to: $('#thing').scrollTop( $('#thing').scrollTop()+$("#table").find("tr:last-child").height() );
[11:51:26] <abjorn> I should find out
[11:51:39] <fr4nk> :)
[11:52:09] <fr4nk> saving form data can be done with php..
[11:53:15] <jessica> done, i can save a form, but getting confused on multiple rows
[11:53:19] <jessica> how do i post ?
[11:54:30] <abjorn> neato, :last-child is 34% slower than .last() in chrome
[11:55:21] <abjorn> same in ie9 c:
[11:55:30] <abjorn> anyways, BACK TO WHAT I WAS DOING
[11:56:09] <fr4nk> :D
[11:57:04] <ejo> jessica, there are several ways to save multiple rows like that.  One is to give each input a unique id (in the 'name' attr of the input elements) so that they all serialize distinctly into POST data.
[11:57:05] <abjorn> http://jsperf.com/last-child-vs-jquery-last <- if you're curious
[11:58:01] <ejo> jessica: another option is to write your own serializer that reads the values of the input elements and builds a list of objects that represents their values... then submit that to the server as JSON
[11:58:55] <jessica> for a new bie this line looks lil heavy to digest, it will be great if u can point me to any example and i can scratch my mind
[11:58:58] <ejo> I prefer the JSON technique because the data is more clearly structured, instead of attempting to express the serialization in key/id/name fields that often require yucky processing
[11:59:17] <jessica> i too will prefer json
[11:59:43] <andrew9184> is it possible to have a invisible div fire a hover event on a div underneath ?
[12:01:28] <andrew9184> ah, i had to do trigger('mouseenter'), mouseout
[12:02:59] <jessica> ejo , any example to suggest ?
[12:03:48] <djQuery_> how do you cause an input to focus after adding it.
[12:03:49] <djQuery_> http://jsbin.com/apifag/6/edit
[12:03:57] <djQuery_> last line in this
[12:04:02] <Kenjin> hello
[12:08:06] <jessica> ??
[12:08:21] <ejo> i'm pasting and formatting
[12:09:07] <jessica> kk
[12:12:32] <ejo> nah... my example is too complicated
[12:13:01] <ejo> my suggestion is learn backbone.js for things like this, it will take a few days to learn but then you will be able to make things like variable forms work very smoothly
[12:13:56] <djQuery_> jessica,  I missed it what are you trying to do
[12:14:25] <jessica> tryin to save data from multiple dynamic rows in mysql
[12:14:34] <jessica> using json
[12:14:46] <djQuery_> you are not saving as each row is added?
[12:15:56] <jessica> nopes , all at ones
[12:16:14] <sunbeam> any prettyphoto users in here?
[12:20:11] <fr4nk> jessica, how do you want process the form data? whats in the action attribute in your form?
[12:20:38] <fr4nk> or do you submit the form wit jquery and send the json with ajax to a script on the server?
[12:20:56] <fr4nk> json you can get easily with http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[12:21:15] <jessica> i wish to use the 2nd option coz it does refresh the entire page
[12:21:38] <jessica> something like this-
[12:21:39] <jessica> 	$(document).ready(function(){ 		$('#btnSubmit').click(function(){ 			$.ajax({ 				type: "POST", 				url: 'http://funiks.com/invoice/phonebook/submit_new_contact_ajax.php', 				data: "fname=" + $('#fname').val() + "&lname=" + $('#lname').val(), 				success: function(data){ 					$('#status').html(data); 					$('#fname').val(''); 					$('#lname').val(''); 				} 			}); 		}); 	});
[12:22:14] <jessica> now i have the php side code for this too, but i dont know how to do all this in multiple rows
[12:22:23] <jessica> ejo any update ?
[12:23:29] <fr4nk> just set the data to: data: $('#myForm').serializeArray(), i think thats all
[12:24:22] <ejo> I repeat my suggestion of picking up backbone.js
[12:24:32] <ejo> but fr4nk is right, you can just use serializeArray()
[12:24:45] <jessica> and what to do in the php side
[12:25:00] <ejo> only issue is you will have to deal with multiple items having the same key on the server side in that array when multiple rows are serialized
[12:25:02] <jessica> ejo ru typing any code to show me ??
[12:25:30] <ejo> no, I decided my example was too customized for my app and too complex to be helpful
[12:25:38] <jessica> kk
[12:25:45] <djQuery_> jessica, you will just need to build an array of items to be submitted.
[12:26:08] <djQuery_> it appears that you allreay have getting the items handled you just need to put them in an array
[12:26:20] <jessica> whats the simplest way djQuery_ , can u point me any example both jquery and php side
[12:27:10] <jessica> or u can update my jsfiddle and show me php code on pastebin or something
[12:27:17] <jessica> http://jsfiddle.net/gKJEs/35/
[12:27:42] <mbrevda> I created a function to allow a multi-select to select multiple items with a single click. Its works great, it just dose this weird jumpy thing. To try it, click '#feedback' and then scroll down and select something at the bottom. Ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/gLZ3R/
[12:28:40] <mbrevda> seems to work better in FF, trying safari atm
[12:28:59] <mbrevda> safari == same as chrome
[12:32:07] <fr4nk> jessica: http://stuff.fraenkysweb.de/ajax/
[12:33:28] <fr4nk> jessica: http://pastebin.com/v8FPBdBx
[12:33:59] <fr4nk> jessica: http://pastebin.com/5HZhNpxm
[12:34:08] <jessica> and the php code, how ru sending the data in mysql?
[12:34:18] <fr4nk> on php side you have to build a insert string and send it to the mysql db
[12:34:27] <fr4nk> i just echo it atm
[12:34:37] <jessica> kk
[12:34:52] <jessica> and if u wanna save it u got a use forloop
[12:35:08] <jessica> i wanna see that how to do it
[12:35:55] <jessica> i tried somethig like this, but its giving me error
[12:36:03] <jessica> http://mysql.chosd.com/41
[12:36:32] <fr4nk> just a sec, coding right now
[12:36:54] <jessica> kk
[12:45:07] <fr4nk> jessica: http://pastebin.com/LzDFbyrj and see source of http://stuff.fraenkysweb.de/ajax/
[12:45:24] <fr4nk> i changed the name attribute of the added inputs!
[12:45:24] <jessica> kk
[12:46:08] <jessica> kk gimme 5 mins system is slow, its rendering a heavy scene
[12:47:19] <fr4nk> do you ever coded php?
[12:50:40] <djQuery_> jessica, http://jsbin.com/avipub/2/edit
[12:50:51] <djQuery_> just missing the actual submit code
[12:51:23] <jessica> lil bil coded in php but i understand the basics
[12:51:56] <djQuery_> could probably searialze each row instead of looping through the inputs though
[12:52:27] <djQuery_> might want a hidden input with the ID of the row for when they edit existing rows
[12:53:32] <jessica> lookin at it
[12:53:59] <jessica> what just fr4nk showed, isnt that similar ?
[12:54:25] <fr4nk> i cant see the jsbin.com code o.O
[12:54:37] <djQuery_> didn't look as his is php and I dont know php that good
[12:55:12] <fr4nk> y i only see this: http://static.jsbin.com/images/jsbin_animated.gif
[12:55:16] <fr4nk> ?
[12:55:30] <fr4nk> noscript is allowed, adblocker?
[12:56:58] <djQuery_> but no it looks like his code is better
[12:57:15] <jessica> hmmm
[12:57:22] <jessica> fr4nk u there
[12:57:25] <jessica> i just PM ou

[13:08:52] <rindolf> djQuery_: nice nickname!
[13:08:59] <djQuery_> thanks
[13:09:26] <djQuery_> rindolf, limited imagination
[13:09:40] <rindolf> djQuery_: OK.
[13:09:53] <djQuery_> ftips.find('input').first().focus();    u no focus?
[13:10:16] <techquila> chur thanks djQuery_

[13:11:11] <djQuery_> are u saying I am posting it too much?
[13:13:15] <rindolf> djQuery_: what?
[13:14:40] <Cory__> can someone tell me why this is not working? $("#social li a:hover").hide();
[13:15:29] <ph88> i'm using jquery and jquery-ui  ever since i start to use them my table looks like this http://i.imgur.com/hRyR7.jpg  (with heavy markup) this is my HTML http://pastebin.com/hUPR9PdY. I'm not including any jquery css file (i did before) and still the markup stays. How do i get rid of it ??
[13:21:33] <zduffy> I have a question. When you are in a loop and you name a certain div what are the second third and so on div names?
[13:22:05] <djQuery_> div0 div1 div2
[13:22:47] <zduffy> So I have a div in the iteration we will call it div name="div"
[13:22:59] <zduffy> the second and third iterations are div1 div2 and so on?
[13:27:10] <djQuery_> dont know u didnt give much info
[13:27:37] <djQuery_> you can have more than 1 div with a NAME of div just not an ID of div
[13:29:44] <dblosevn> zduffy: use classes div doesnt even support the name attribute, so it will fail validation
[13:30:46] <zduffy> dblosevn: I have a while loop with two sets of radio buttons, I want the radio buttons to only control that record not the first. How is this possible
[13:31:16] <dblosevn> zduffy: I will need a little more then that
[13:31:23] <dblosevn> ?demo @zduffy
[13:31:23] <bot-t> zduffy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:32:30] <dblosevn> impossible to answer that without seeing the dom structure and the while loop
[13:33:46] <zduffy> Working on it dblosevn thank you
[13:35:57] <dblosevn> zduffy: no problem, but assuming that the target element is wrapped in the same parent as the radio and has a class of target lets say a div with a class of parent you could add a click handler to the radio and do something like $(this).closest('div.parent').find('target')
[13:36:35] <zduffy> Awesome I will show you an example shortly
[13:36:54] <dblosevn> zduffy: hence <div class="parent"><input type="radio" /> <div class="target"></div></div>
[13:38:06] <dblosevn> zduffy: oops $(this).closest('div.parent').find('.target')
[13:38:33] <zduffy> i think i understand. I will have an example to show
[13:38:46] <hugo_moss> is there a way to watch the amount of animation for a certain number of debug statements?
[13:38:59] <hugo_moss> while debugging in chrome, it shows the animation only after i finish debugging
[13:39:20] <hugo_moss> how can i view an animation between certain parts of my code?
[13:39:39] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: I thought there was a callback on each animation event?
[13:40:08] <hugo_moss> ?
[13:40:32] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: I know I have seen it before, although its not in .animate I think its in the easing plugin
[13:41:09] <hugo_moss> im not following
[13:41:32] <danheberden> "is there a way to watch the amount of animation for a certain number of debug statements?" doesn't make sense
[13:41:40] <danheberden> you are animating debug statements?
[13:41:45] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: your trying to debug where an animation is going wrong?
[13:41:51] <hugo_moss> yeah
[13:41:58] <hugo_moss> say i have a statement
[13:42:04] <hugo_moss> that uses .hide()
[13:42:04] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: so being able to debug each tick of the animation is probally what your looking for
[13:42:13] <hugo_moss> why wont that animation show in the browser after debugging that statement
[13:42:35] <danheberden> which is what "step" does see ?animate
[13:42:36] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[13:43:06] <hugo_moss> oh
[13:43:07] <hugo_moss> duh
[13:43:08] <djQuery_> any idea why my my focus is not happening ?   http://jsbin.com/apifag/12/edit
[13:43:12] <hugo_moss> im not stepping into that function
[13:43:14] <hugo_moss> thats why
[13:43:15] <dblosevn> danheberden: thats what i was trying to think of the step callback
[13:43:18] <hugo_moss> wait but
[13:44:17] <hugo_moss> what im not understanding
[13:44:21] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: on complete is fired after the entire animation is complete, step should be fired on every tick of the animation
[13:44:34] <hugo_moss> is why does the browser not update when debugging a statement like hide
[13:45:02] <hugo_moss> it only updates after im done debugging
[13:45:18] <hugo_moss> you know what im saying
[13:45:29] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: not really :-P
[13:45:36] <sunbeam> does anyone know what i do wrong with this ?
[13:45:39] <sunbeam> current_image = $("a[href='" + link_current_image + "']");
[13:45:41] <danheberden> dblosevn: try the native focus method
[13:45:45] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: better to show then tell lol
[13:45:46] <danheberden> .get(0).focus()
[13:45:50] <sunbeam> link_current_image = 'images/someimage.jpg'
[13:45:57] <zduffy> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/RvQ3Q/
[13:46:10] <zduffy> I know i don't have data hooked up to it, but I hope you understand
[13:46:10] <hugo_moss> ok, im saying, why does the animation of a .hide() not show in the browser window after stepping through that statement?
[13:46:17] <dblosevn> danheberden: me === lost i dont have a problem lol
[13:46:23] <hugo_moss> why does the browser not update
[13:46:38] <danheberden> you're asking why the browser doesn't update when you don't run the code yet?
[13:46:49] <hugo_moss> after you execute the statement
[13:46:54] <hugo_moss> of .hide()
[13:47:04] <hugo_moss> or .show()
[13:47:16] <danheberden> when does the animation fire, hugo_moss
[13:47:28] <hugo_moss> i dont know
[13:47:28] <dblosevn> zduffy: I see the radio buttons but where are the targets its supossed to update? thats what I really need to see as well as this while loop your speaking of
[13:47:35] <danheberden> you aren't making sense hugo_moss
[13:47:53] <danheberden> if you are stepping through function calls, you have to step through them for them to, you know, execute
[13:47:53] * dblosevn needs a drink
[13:48:08] <hugo_moss> right dblosevn
[13:48:11] <hugo_moss> right
[13:48:14] <sunbeam> current_image = $("a[href='" + link_current_image + "']"); // does anyone see whats wrong here?
[13:48:41] <danheberden> dblosevn: sorry, i meant djQuery_
[13:48:44] <hugo_moss> i have a body { something.show; something.hide(); etc etc }
[13:48:52] <hugo_moss> after i debug the first statement
[13:48:57] <rhizmoe> hi all
[13:49:00] <hugo_moss> the show animation should show in the browser window
[13:49:02] <hugo_moss> why doesnt it
[13:49:22] <hugo_moss> it only shows the whole entire animation after the whole body is executed
[13:49:50] <danheberden> is the animation a css3 animation?
[13:49:54] <danheberden> or the js of hide/show
[13:49:58] <hugo_moss> js of hide/show
[13:50:00] <hugo_moss> jquery
[13:50:32] <hugo_moss> you understand what im saying?
[13:50:34] <rhizmoe> does a large draggable that covers two distinct droppable targets create ambiguity?
[13:50:43] <danheberden> so executing something.show(1000); only actually shows over the course of 1000ms when you finally are done with .hide()?
[13:50:50] <djQuery_> danheberden, YEAH fixed
[13:50:53] <danheberden> hugo_moss: i guess, it just doesn't make sense
[13:51:05] <hugo_moss> you mean it shouldnt happen?
[13:53:03] <djQuery_> in case anyone was in suspense $('<input>', {type: 'number'}).prependTo(ftips).get(0).focus();
[13:54:24] <djQuery_> now to redo everything in sencha touch

[13:58:21] <dblosevn> warbler: http://jsfiddle.net/PQBHu/
[14:00:02] <dblosevn> warbler: or http://jsfiddle.net/PQBHu/1/ if your having a problem with it going to the root of the site on click
[14:00:42] <warbler> taking a look my good man
[14:02:20] <warbler> dblosevn you're my hero
[14:02:24] <warbler> <3
[14:04:38] <zduffy> ugh I can't figure out why this isn't working dblosevn
[14:04:56] <dblosevn> zduffy: wroks great in my fiddle :-)
[14:05:02] <dblosevn> works even
[14:05:02] <zduffy> I know it does lol
[14:05:27] <warbler> dblosevn the reason why I wanted it turned into a button was because of this little issue I'm having... take a look at the 'REGISTER' button top right of the page: http://pointstackers.com
[14:05:28] <dblosevn> zduffy: did you add my css class?
[14:05:34] <zduffy> Yes
[14:05:44] <zduffy> Im going to dump my code in paste bin if you don't mind
[14:05:53] <zduffy> I'm echoing though php and i just can't see my error
[14:05:56] <warbler> The text 'REGISTER' is higher for some dumb reason...(css probably)
[14:05:57] <dblosevn> zduffy: also add the target class to the CNum element
[14:06:03] <zduffy> Did that :)
[14:06:21] <dblosevn> warbler: give me a sec
[14:06:42] <warbler> dblosevn I updated the fiddle to include the required CSS http://jsfiddle.net/PQBHu/2/
[14:06:45] <dblosevn> zduffy: pm me a link so i can figure out what you did wrong
[14:06:56] <warbler> I will wait for you dblosevn. =)
[14:07:00] <zduffy> I think its because it wasn't on dom ready
[14:07:02] <zduffy> lol
[14:10:19] <sunbeam> Anyone in here ever used Prettyphoto jQuery plugin?

[14:19:33] <ph88> how to remove the default markup of jquery ui ??
[14:19:36] <ph88> i
[14:19:41] <ph88> i'm not even using a css file ...
[14:29:27] <warbler> dblosevn any idea why it isn't styling the button at all or...? http://jsfiddle.net/PQBHu/5/ <---everything is there, you can see how it's rendering on http://pointstackers.com as well
[14:29:36] <veQue> i think you can override it ph88
[14:29:42] <veQue> just add your own css file
[14:29:48] <warbler> This is the last issue I have and I can finally stand up and let the blood return to my feet...
[14:30:04] <ph88> veQue: i haven't add any css that comes with jquery .. what would i be overriding ?
[14:30:50] <dblosevn> zduffy: I am still with you im on the phone though so ill be a lil longer
[14:30:57] <veQue> ph88: what ever element is not behaving the way you want
[14:31:01] <dblosevn> also @warbler
[14:31:11] <zduffy> dblosevn: the encoding of my file was out of whack. I fixed that and now its doing the same as it was before
[14:31:12] <warbler> I will include the div it's referencing as well
[14:31:15] <veQue> ph88: maybe you can be moe specific

[14:33:23] <ph88> veQue: no i don't want any colors, i just want the default table view by my browser
[14:34:55] <veQue> I would think you can make a new style for #phrases_table{}
[14:34:55] <warbler> Now it's complete: http://jsfiddle.net/PQBHu/7/
[14:35:04] <warbler> The displaying of the problem that is....
[14:36:00] <ph88> veQue:  i have this as my own css: #phrases_table {  border-spacing: 4px; }
[14:37:06] <veQue> what happens when you add a background-color?
[14:39:42] <veQue> you dont any files in <head> that are .csss?
[14:39:43] <ph88> veQue: that works
[14:39:51] <veQue> -s
[14:40:31] <ph88> veQue: i have only my own css file in the head
[14:41:19] <veQue> yeh it's weird, i dont quite understand some of the things jquery does
[14:41:27] <veQue> but at least it's fixed
[14:41:51] <ph88> it's not fixed
[14:42:38] <veQue> ok
[14:42:46] <ph88> it looks like this now http://i.imgur.com/rWPtD.png
[14:43:45] <veQue> ok
[14:43:54] <veQue> you got to tell me what you are going for
[14:44:04] <veQue> you just want lines?

[14:44:53] <veQue> that's how i'd expect it to look
[14:45:53] <Log1x> so..i want a div to be hidden on homepage, show on anything not homepage. did it with php. now, the div im hiding, if u are on the homepage, i have a way of showing it by toggle. the div is also using ajax to pull info from other files. both are pulling a header. the header contains said PHP if statement to hide on homepage. when doing a transition with the div, its repulling the header to display:none and
[14:45:53] <Log1x>  instead of fadeOuting, its just calling the display:none instantly and creating a popping effect. this is a really stupid probelm, but does anyone happen to knwo how i could approch this so it works with/without js??
[14:46:43] <ph88> veQue:  i want this: http://i.imgur.com/tb5yw.png   how the table is rendered by default without any markup in firefox 17.0

[14:53:42] <veQue> oh check the jquery api
[14:53:44] <veQue> ?

[15:33:18] <dblosevn> your probally not wrapping my code in a dom ready
[15:35:18] <RingtailedFox> so, i have my website call upon jquery-1.8.3.js, but a script i like calls upon jquery-1.3.2.min.js... in the event the script doesn't like 1.8.3, can i have both running in tandem (at least, have it reference the older one, with the rest of the site getting 1.8.3)?
[15:35:22] <RingtailedFox> or will they conflict?
[15:35:55] <warbler> dblosevn|phone - wrapped it and now it shows up correctly but it doesn't do what it's supposed to do....this is driving me batcrap crazy i tell u
[15:36:48] <dblosevn|phone> warbler: back on the phone
[15:36:57] <warbler> ok I will wait! =)

[15:57:14] <hcumberd`> How to create two JQuery UI Sortable's where it is possible to drag and drop from one to another?
[15:57:24] <rhizmoe> with a droppable target, is a div/span with padding, containing a link, a better target than a bare link with padding?
[15:57:44] <rhizmoe> hcumberd`: same as any other
[15:57:52] <hcumberd`> idea is to have a list at the left, elements are copied due drag&drop

[16:17:49] <rmurphey> i see you trying to call the script
[16:17:59] <rmurphey> yes, just tried
[16:18:07] <rmurphey> http://d.pr/i/DFPL
[16:18:18] <rmurphey> other than that, the only occurrence of 'toc' isin the word 'protocol'
[16:18:32] <rmurphey> RingtailedFox: check your browser's console
[16:18:45] <rmurphey> http://d.pr/i/lhPu
[16:18:52] <RingtailedFox> hold on. i just purged the cloudflare cache
[16:18:53] <RingtailedFox> try again
[16:19:07] <rmurphey> the script is still 404
[16:19:12] <RingtailedFox> <div id="toc"></div>
[16:19:12] <RingtailedFox> <div id="wrapper"></div>
[16:19:36] <tw2113> is this loaded at all? <script src="jquery.tableofcontents.min.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
[16:19:43] <dns-away> <div id="clear:both();"></div> :-)
[16:19:43] <rmurphey> http://d.pr/i/30h3http://d.pr/i/30h3
[16:19:52] <tw2113> whether directly like that or concat into a different file
[16:20:03] <RingtailedFox> where's the console in opera?

[16:21:54] <RingtailedFox> o.O
[16:21:58] <RingtailedFox> ok, now i'm confused
[16:22:22] <tw2113> i was confused once, but then i got a name change
[16:23:04] <RingtailedFox> "Unhandled Error: '$("#toc").tableOfContents' is not a function"
[16:23:13] <rmurphey> RingtailedFox: that is because the script is not getting loaded
[16:23:18] <RingtailedFox> why not?
[16:23:19] <rmurphey> fix that first :)
[16:23:26] <RingtailedFox> mkay
[16:23:29] <rmurphey> i don't know, maybe you are trying to load it from the wrong location?
[16:23:33] <tw2113> your script file is 404ing
[16:23:46] <tw2113> http://www.mobianlegends.com/alpha/jquery.tableofcontents.min.js
[16:23:48] <rmurphey> there is no file at the location from which you are trying to load it, according to your server
[16:24:06] <RingtailedFox> yeah, i fixed it
[16:24:08] <RingtailedFox> still get the error
[16:24:19] <rmurphey> i don't know opera's dev tools, but chrome's dev tools make this very plain
[16:24:32] <tw2113> if only IE had decent tools
[16:24:37] <tw2113> they'd be with the big boys
[16:24:41] <rmurphey> the script is still 404, as is very clear from chrome's console RingtailedFox
[16:25:07] <RingtailedFox> yah, i have no idea hwy
[16:25:08] <RingtailedFox> *why
[16:25:18] <tw2113> file permissions? maybe the server can't read it
[16:25:29] <RingtailedFox> it's 644
[16:25:32] <RingtailedFox> isn't that what it should be?
[16:25:44] <dblosevn|phone> warbler: try that http://jsfiddle.net/fzNnC/2/
[16:26:19] <warbler> im just trying to figure out to style the <a>
[16:26:23] <rmurphey> RingtailedFox: there are any number of reasons it could not be working -- your server could be improperly configured, the script may not be where you are looking for it, etc
[16:26:28] <warbler> take a look http://pointstackers.com
[16:26:44] <rmurphey> you could have the filename wrong :)
[16:26:51] <dblosevn|phone> new approach lol
[16:27:09] <dns-away> RingtailedFox, you can check for .htaccess rules
[16:27:13] <rmurphey> it is very hard to say ... all that we can really say from what we see is that your server believes that there is not a file at the location from which you are requesting it
[16:27:20] <RingtailedFox> http://www.mobianlegends.com/js/jquery.toc/js/jquery.tableofcontents.js
[16:27:24] <RingtailedFox> apparently it's there
[16:27:53] <rmurphey> RingtailedFox: that's not where you're requesting it from
[16:28:01] <RingtailedFox> yes, i am
[16:28:07] <rmurphey> http://mobianlegends.com/js/jquery.toc/jquery.tableofcontents.min.js
[16:28:08] <rmurphey> is not
[16:28:14] <rmurphey> http://www.mobianlegends.com/js/jquery.toc/js/jquery.tableofcontents.js
[16:28:15] <RingtailedFox> <script src="/js/jquery.toc/js/jquery.tableofcontents.min.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
[16:28:16] <rmurphey> plainly
[16:28:31] <RingtailedFox> refresh the page
[16:28:40] <rmurphey> *now* it is loading
[16:29:03] <RingtailedFox> i have just a blue square there
[16:29:12] <RingtailedFox> well, rectangle
[16:29:42] <RingtailedFox> what's the next step here? we have the script loaded
[16:30:39] <rmurphey> RingtailedFox: have you read that ftj link?
[16:30:45] <rmurphey> if not, that is the next step :)
[16:31:23] <rmurphey> ?ftj
[16:31:23] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[16:31:52] <RingtailedFox> yeah,i'm reading that right now
[16:32:11] <RingtailedFox> i'm at "R U Steppin Me Bro?"
[16:32:15] <RingtailedFox> *Steppin To Me
[16:33:12] <RingtailedFox> did i go too far? not far enough?
[16:33:32] <rmurphey> RingtailedFox: this is basically a case of, we can do the debugging for you, or you can learn how to debug
[16:33:36] <rmurphey> i'd recommend the latter
[16:33:47] <RingtailedFox> i'd like to know how to debug
[16:33:53] <tw2113> to be fair, console isn't showing me anything in firebug
[16:33:53] <RingtailedFox> is it hard to learn?
[16:34:05] <RingtailedFox> same. it shows everything as loaded properly for me in Dragonfly (Opera's debugger)
[16:34:06] <rmurphey> RingtailedFox: it takes practice
[16:34:16] <RingtailedFox> that's fine with me. i have all the time in the world, since i'm unemployed
[16:34:18] <rmurphey> tw2113: that's when you resort to breakpoints
[16:34:24] <RingtailedFox> wait wait
[16:34:27] <RingtailedFox> let me back up to breakpoints
[16:34:36] <rmurphey> i'd probalby use the unminified version of the script in order to make breakpoints a bit easier to set
[16:34:43] <RingtailedFox> already done :)
[16:35:03] <RingtailedFox> refresh to see it's now the full version
[16:35:18] <RingtailedFox> this originally called on jquery-1.3.2.min.js... but i have jquery-1.8.3.js... is that fine?
[16:36:17] <RingtailedFox> i mean, i have jquery-1.3.2.min.js as well... just.. don't have it loaded in the head.php (the header)
[16:40:45] <rmurphey> RingtailedFox: depends on whether the plugin depends on any functionality that was changed or deprecated between 1.3.2 and 1.8.3
[16:40:49] <rmurphey> 1.3.2 was a long time ago
[16:40:54] <RingtailedFox> can i load both without issue?
[16:41:19] <rmurphey> RingtailedFox: you will need to use .noConflict
[16:41:38] <rmurphey> and possibly need to either modify the plugn or ensure proper loading order
[16:41:51] <rmurphey> as they both assign a value to window.jQuery by default
[16:42:04] <RingtailedFox> .noconflict? hmmmm
[16:42:49] <rmurphey> ?noconflict
[16:42:50] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[16:43:23] <RingtailedFox> inspecting
[16:43:30] <RingtailedFox> you know what? let's just test it with 1.3.2.min for now
[16:43:39] <RingtailedFox> if it works with that, then we'll figure out how to get them to play nice
[16:43:48] <tw2113> 1.3.2 is worth ditching
[16:43:50] <tw2113> imho :D
[16:44:03] <RingtailedFox> i know
[16:44:06] <RingtailedFox> but that's what this script calls upon
[16:44:11] <RingtailedFox> and it's the most-recent script i could find
[16:44:15] <rmurphey> no no no
[16:44:29] <tw2113> 1.3.2 was released in early 2009
[16:44:49] <tw2113> i had to look up 1.2.6 this weekend, so it's not the oldest i've seen
[16:44:58] <rmurphey> do not try to make a multi-year-old version work
[16:44:58] <rmurphey> make the current version work
[16:44:59] <rmurphey> ffs, a toc plugin is not that hard
[16:45:07] <rmurphey> you can fix it to work with 1.8.3 if need be
[16:45:38] <tw2113> we could pester doug and see if he knows of anything that'd prevent it from working with 1.8.*
[16:46:05] <dblosevn|phone> pester me?
[16:46:06] <rmurphey> chances are it's just labeled to work with 1.3.2 because that's what was current when he wrote it
[16:46:27] <tw2113> are you doug neiner, dblosevn|phone ?
[16:46:38] <dblosevn|phone> doug mcarthur lol
[16:46:46] <tw2113> close but not close enough
[16:47:28] <dblosevn> you didnt specify lmao
[16:48:08] <tw2113>  you weren't aware of the scope of the comment :P
[16:49:58] <RingtailedFox> should i try to get this script to work with 1.8.3?

[16:53:03] <dblosevn> yep bot-t is on smoke break
[16:53:09] <RingtailedFox> it's ok
[16:53:20] <RingtailedFox> anyway... reverting jquery from 1.3.2.min to 1.8.3
[16:53:20] <bot-t> RingtailedFox, No results found for 'Detroit, Michigan'.
[16:53:20] <bot-t> ...
[16:55:20] <bot-t> dblosevn, No results found for 'est'.
[16:56:10] <RingtailedFox> let's see what we have going on... the script loads, but... it has no way to put things into the box...
[16:56:11] <RingtailedFox> hmm.
[16:56:35] <tw2113> no, that's not reverting, that's upgrading
[16:57:10] <RingtailedFox> tw: well, i started with 1.8.3
[16:57:15] <dblosevn> tw2113: well it could be reverting if it was orginally 1.8.2 and he downgraded now is reverting
[16:57:17] <RingtailedFox> then went down to 1.3.2.min to see if that made a difference
[16:57:20] <bot-t> RingtailedFox, No results found for '48226'.
[16:57:34] <RingtailedFox> so, i went back to the newest version
[16:58:05] <RingtailedFox> even with the large articles with a crapload of headings and subheadings <h1> through <h6>, i may not be able to get this to work properly, and it may become more trouble than it's worth
[16:59:00] <RingtailedFox> is this a CSS issue, or a jquery issue?
[16:59:20] <bot-t> dns-away, No results found for '9000'.
[17:01:20] <bot-t> dblosevn, No results found for 'America/New_York'.
[17:03:17] <RingtailedFox> should i try with a different plugin?
[17:03:20] <bot-t> RingtailedFox, No results found for 'Detroit/Michigan'.
[17:03:47] <tw2113> wow, bot-t was lagged
[17:04:05] <tw2113> it's definitely more a jquery issue than css, because it's not contructing the list
[17:04:39] <RingtailedFox> *nods8
[17:05:29] <RingtailedFox> i just wonder why it wouldn't create the list in either 1.3.2.min or 1.8.3
[17:11:44] <RingtailedFox> how do we figure out why it's not loading?  i've not seen any errors
[17:12:18] <RingtailedFox> doi have the code inthe right place, even?
[17:12:29] <RingtailedFox> i know the first two go in <head>.... does the remainder go there, too?
[17:12:45] <RingtailedFox> or does it go where i want the table of contents to show up?
[17:15:29] <RingtailedFox> should i try with the original script i was using?
[17:15:37] <RingtailedFox> from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4912275/automatically-generate-nested-table-of-contents-based-on-heading-tags ?
[17:20:43] <RingtailedFox> tw2113,  and rmurphey i do thank you for helping me
[17:20:46] <RingtailedFox> likewise, oksushi
[17:20:53] <RingtailedFox> at least my page is HTML5 and CSS3 compliant
[17:32:51] <w00tner> can you recommend me a nice crop and resize for images
[17:37:12] <RingtailedFox> this looks way better: http://explosion-pills.com/development/jquery/plugins/headerlinks/
[17:37:16] <RingtailedFox> i just wish i could figure out how to implement it
[17:37:44] <tw2113> why can't you?
[17:40:50] <RingtailedFox> it doesn't say what goes where...
[17:41:09] <RingtailedFox> the page gives a fatal error if i wrap it in <? ?>, and it does not show up if i wrap it in <script></script>
[17:41:20] <RingtailedFox> <div id="table-of-contents"></div>
[17:41:20] <RingtailedFox> <script type="text/javascript">$("#table-of-contents").headerlinks();</script>
[17:41:39] <RingtailedFox> and yes, i've added it to my css file
[17:42:03] <tw2113> you mean the js file
[17:42:04] <tw2113> ?
[17:42:10] <RingtailedFox> <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.headerlinks.min.js"></script>
[17:42:11] <RingtailedFox> 		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/headerlinks_renderer.js"></script>
[17:42:15] <RingtailedFox> yes, those are also in /js/
[17:42:52] <tw2113> do you have a container with the ID of table-of-contents ?
[17:43:09] <RingtailedFox> i have <div id="table-of-contents"></div>
[17:43:14] <RingtailedFox> does that count?
[17:43:35] <tw2113> that'd be fine
[17:43:38] * RingtailedFox nods
[17:43:39] <veQue> hey
[17:43:44] <RingtailedFox> then yes, i do have a container with "table-of-contents"
[17:44:08] <veQue> i want to have 3 or more text inputs connected to an onscreen calculator... any help?
[17:44:14] <veQue> ideas
[17:44:16] <veQue> anything
[17:44:30] <veQue> i found code for a calculator
[17:44:47] <veQue> but i cant seem to connect it but for one text input
[17:45:00] <veQue> i'm trying understand the code but i cant
[17:45:11] <dblosevn> veQue: ask better questions no one could possibly give you a good answer, also try posting some code
[17:45:34] <dblosevn> ?demo @veQue
[17:45:34] <veQue> k
[17:45:34] <bot-t> veQue, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:46:22] <RingtailedFox> my question is, why am i not seeing anything with this script?  i have everything in place
[17:47:08] <dblosevn> RingtailedFox: got a link for me maybe i can spot something
[17:47:17] <RingtailedFox> mobianlegends.com/alpha/contact.php
[17:47:26] <RingtailedFox> css file is mobianlegends.com/css/sonic.php
[17:47:30] <RingtailedFox> *css
[17:47:34] <RingtailedFox> .css, not .php
[17:47:46] <RingtailedFox> if you want to see the code in play, replace contact.php with contact.txt
[17:48:21] <dblosevn> where am i supossed to see this table of contents?
[17:48:40] <RingtailedFox> it should be to the left of Please note that all links here have the "@" symb
[17:49:12] <tw2113> dblosevn, all these TOC plugins are supposed to grab all of the h# tags and populate inside an empty div
[17:49:24] <RingtailedFox> yet they do absolutely nothing
[17:50:00] <dblosevn> RingtailedFox: works great #table-of-contents is just display:none; show it and youll see
[17:50:36] <dblosevn> $('#table-of-contents').show();
[17:50:53] <veQue> https://github.com/Rockncoder/JQMCalculator ok i found this calculator. it comes with a text box at the top but i want to add another text box duplicated(line 18). but i can't seem to get the on screen buttons to display in the other text box. ( am trying to figure out the js file (app.js)
[17:51:30] <dblosevn> well it gets the first h1 anyways
[17:51:35] <tw2113> RingtailedFox, your markup is a bit odd
[17:51:43] <RingtailedFox> how so?
[17:51:48] <tw2113> <h1 class="title"><a name="headerlinks_ident0"></a><a name="headerlinks_ident0"></a><a id="About-Website">Contact</a></h1>
[17:51:50] <RingtailedFox> it's HTML5 compliant
[17:52:28] <RingtailedFox> that "headerlinks" thing must be from the jquery plugin
[17:52:38] <tw2113> ah, good point on that part
[17:52:50] <tw2113> what i get for copying from firebug
[17:53:00] <tw2113> nevermind then
[17:53:21] <RingtailedFox> that's alright
[17:53:24] <RingtailedFox> you had a very good question
[17:54:20] <tw2113> very odd
[17:54:35] <dblosevn> RingtailedFox: what i dont get is why its grabbing the first h1 and not the rest
[17:54:39] <tw2113> http://d.pr/i/VTwZ
[17:54:43] <tw2113> dblosevn, RingtailedFox
[17:54:52] <dblosevn> also why its adding display:none to the toc
[17:55:29] <RingtailedFox> it's not showing up for me in Opera
[17:55:32] <RingtailedFox> what browser are you using?
[17:55:38] <tw2113> firefox
[17:55:43] <dblosevn> chrome, its populating it, its just hidden
[17:55:44] <tw2113> and after i disabled display none
[17:55:53] <tw2113> and after i moved the toc div to the bottom
[17:55:54] <RingtailedFox> attempting with firefox 16
[17:55:57] <tw2113> is how i got that image
[17:56:04] <RingtailedFox> really? i have to move it to the bottom?
[17:56:13] <tw2113> i would hope not
[17:56:13] <RingtailedFox> is the <div id="container"> conflicting?
[17:56:16] <firstclassfunc>  http://pastebin.com/kSZB2mxG  -- is this a bad pattern?
[17:56:19] <RingtailedFox> yeah, that defeats the entire purpose
[17:56:25] <tw2113> but it seemed like it was pulling everything before it
[17:56:33] <RingtailedFox> let's see if firefox works
[17:56:48] <tw2113> like i said, i had to edit where the div was via firebug
[17:56:55] <tw2113> so it's not located at the top
[17:57:20] <RingtailedFox> if it's at the bottom, then there's no point to it
[17:59:51] <tw2113> the jquery part of the demo is a bit unique http://explosion-pills.com/development/jquery/plugins/headerlinks/#headerlinks_ident16
[17:59:54] <RingtailedFox> huh. it does not show in firefox either
[17:59:56] <RingtailedFox> hmm
[18:00:06] <RingtailedFox> wait, what do i have to modify for it to work?
[18:03:34] <dblosevn> im wondering if thats really the issue
[18:03:46] <dblosevn> im thinking if moving it worked then the code is running to early
[18:04:15] <dblosevn> its not necessarily the placement of the toc div as much as when your running the code to gen it
[18:05:29] <tw2113> *slaps forehead*
[18:05:43] <tw2113> there's no $(document).ready() wrapping
[18:06:00] * dblosevn oops lol
[18:06:21] <tw2113> there wasn't with the previous plugin either
[18:07:52] <dblosevn> they probally executted it inline at the bottom of the page then
[18:08:10] <tw2113> RingtailedFox, remove the $("#table-of-contents").headerlinks(); script block from where it's currently at
[18:08:25] <tw2113> and put this right before the closing </head> tag
[18:08:26] <tw2113> http://pastebin.com/spvsg6Xz
[18:09:19] <tw2113> does anyone else seem to get completely wrapped up in solving other peoples issues, that you temporarily neglect what you're currently doing at the time?
[18:09:41] <dblosevn> i did it 4 times tonight lol
[18:10:20] <dblosevn> made a couple hundred bucks in support though while on the phone in the process though so its whatever lol
[18:12:08] <tw2113> for as much google praises speed and whatnot, they sure have some apps that take a long time to download comparably
[18:12:18] <tw2113> i'm looking at plusone buttons and ads
[18:12:51] <tw2113> facebook isn't great either
[18:42:43] <firstclassfunc> deferreds rule
[18:44:51] <shoky> and that's a promise
[18:45:13] <shoky> :S
[18:46:00] <coldhead> hahahahahahah >: |
[18:54:46] <tw2113> shoky, is coldhead being a good boy his first day?
[18:56:42] <coldhead> good enough baby
[19:00:58] <RingtailedFox> tw2113, i'm on it
[19:03:39] <RingtailedFox> tw2113, it almost works: http://www.mobianlegends.com/alpha/contact.php
[19:03:52] <tw2113> by this time, i have the url memorized
[19:03:55] <tw2113> and leave it open in a tab
[19:03:58] <RingtailedFox> sorry
[19:04:05] <RingtailedFox> i had to be pulled away by family for a while, but i'm back
[19:04:49] <tw2113> hmm
[19:04:52] <tw2113> still no worky
[19:06:27] <RingtailedFox> doesnt' work for you?
[19:06:35] <tw2113> wait
[19:06:38] <tw2113> let me check 1 thing
[19:07:03] <tw2113> no, i'm not seeing anything inside it
[19:07:06] <RingtailedFox> same
[19:07:14] <tw2113> and it's not set to display none either
[19:08:11] <RingtailedFox> Dragonfly shows an error
[19:08:20] <RingtailedFox> Unhandled Error: Undefined variable: SyntaxHighlighter
[19:08:25] <tw2113> unrelated
[19:08:31] <RingtailedFox> line 13
[19:08:31] <RingtailedFox> hmm
[19:08:43] <RingtailedFox> headerlinks.renderer.js
[19:08:45] <RingtailedFox> you sure?
[19:08:54] <RingtailedFox> i'm starting to think this can't be done
[19:08:58] <tw2113> bs
[19:09:47] <RingtailedFox> it also claims to still be loading, stopped at 150/151
[19:09:47] <tw2113> hmm, maybe syntaxhighlighter is related
[19:09:50] <RingtailedFox> i think so
[19:09:52] <RingtailedFox> see?
[19:10:28] <tw2113> except the error is being shown in some addthis.com script
[19:10:37] <^Mike> Why would I be getting "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: link[@rel*=style][title]" after upgrading 1.5.2 -> 1.8.3? The code in question is http://p.hashbang.ca/72+#l26
[19:11:02] <RingtailedFox> dragonfly shows it in headerlinks_renderer.js and that addthis.com is clean
[19:11:54] <wroathe> test
[19:12:08] <RingtailedFox> hmm?
[19:13:51] <tw2113> where did you get that file?
[19:13:58] <tw2113> headerlinks_renderer
[19:14:13] <RingtailedFox> that file? from http://explosion-pills.com/development/jquery/plugins/headerlinks/_js/
[19:14:16] <misteroneill> ^Mike: looks like you've got some stray characters in there - Ã‚Â at line 27 after "function()"
[19:14:32] <^Mike> I also notice that my easeInOutQuad animation is suddenly not animating smoothly.
[19:14:54] <^Mike> misteroneill: Yes, those are HTML whitespace that got interpreted as UTF-8; they're irrelevant, and already fixed.
[19:15:02] <tw2113> RingtailedFox, going through http://explosion-pills.com/development/jquery/plugins/headerlinks/ it never prompts for that file
[19:15:15] <tw2113> just jquery.headerlinks.min.js
[19:21:24] <gates> I have am using sortable() on a box that is holding an iframe but its TERRIBLY slow ..yet i've notice that if i hide or remove the iframe it is a smooth drag and drop.. how do i create a button that enables drag and drop and also hides the iframes and turn it on/off
[19:22:16] <gates> do i use like data() to have states?
[19:22:19] <gates> or is there a better way?
[19:41:19] <RingtailedFox> PERFECT, tw2113!~
[19:41:22] <RingtailedFox> thank you!
[19:41:49] <tw2113> eh?
[19:42:14] <tw2113> hmm, it finally kicked in
[19:42:25] <tw2113> what changed?
[19:48:03] <DrDank> has anyone used TutsPlus - 30 Days to learn jQuery?
[19:48:19] <coldhead> i don't have that kind of time
[19:48:26] <tw2113> what's jQuery?
[19:49:26] <coldhead> $(this) is jQuery
[19:49:47] <tw2113> ohhhhhh
[19:49:52] <tw2113> money is jQuery
[19:50:54] <coldhead> cash money
[19:51:22] <tw2113> big money hustlas?
[19:52:29] <tina> i want to duplicate the same text 28 times and replace 1 value in it e.g. &n=1, &n=2. everything else is the same except the n value. how would i go about doing that?
[19:55:34] <coldhead> like this tina ? http://jsfiddle.net/ArNfL/
[20:00:39] <^Mike> Is there a mailing list for jquery release announcements?
[20:03:38] <tw2113> best i can think of is following the jquery blog
[20:05:40] <tina> thanks coldhead. that's the kind of thing i'm looking for but kinda different. i want to populate the body of an HTML document with an image whose source is a URL and then ends in the different n value, 28 times. i took what you gave me and tried to make it work in that context but i'm too new at this to really do it properly.
[20:06:22] <RingtailedFox> tw2113: i did whatyou said, removed one of the js files
[20:06:37] <RingtailedFox> removed headerlinks file
[20:08:04] <tw2113> the renderer one?
[20:09:15] <tw2113> bah, the rss for blog.jquery.com isn't validating
[20:10:03] <coldhead> tina: http://jsfiddle.net/DRDfT/ ?
[20:10:33] <w00tner> does anyone here uses jcrop ?
[20:10:59] <tina> hahahaha yes!
[20:11:02] <tina> thanks coldhead
[20:12:08] <coldhead> hooray
[20:13:59] <thinkxl> good night
[20:14:59] <coldhead> goodnight forever
[20:16:23] <thinkxl> how can I add a function to a <pre><code contentedit="true"> to highlight it
[20:16:29] <thinkxl> when you are typing
[20:16:40] <thinkxl> I tried keyup keydown and keypress
[20:17:41] <thinkxl> live demo: http://thinkxl.github.com/docss/
[20:19:17] <tina> thanks coldhead. when i put the URL i'm working into jfiddle it works but when i try to do it in my document.ready it doesn't work.
[20:19:40] <coldhead> thinkxl: http://jsfiddle.net/QnpDm/
[20:19:59] <coldhead> tina: is there a syntax error or something?
[20:22:51] <tina> yes it says there's a syntax error in the last line
[20:25:24] <tw2113> coldhead, did you syntax error all over yourself?
[20:26:06] <thinkxl> coldhead thanks but I want to add a function when I write code and only load one time using keypress
[20:30:17] <defaultro> collapsible question. What could be the reason why a collapsible after it's clicked, goes up again? However, the collapsible on top of it is fine.
[20:32:18] <tina> coldhead it says the syntax error is in the last line you provided. even if i add a semicolon still the same thing.
[20:32:50] <coldhead> ?p @ tina
[20:32:51] <bot-t> tina, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:33:02] <coldhead> it's probably adding a semicolon in the wrong place
[20:33:20] <coldhead> try to put the code inside the function () {} on a single line
[20:34:25] <tina> still the same error coldhead.
[20:34:56] <coldhead> paste the code
[20:36:09] <tina> oh! i got it to work, coldhead. it was weird, there was an invisible character in the html. when i pasted it into codepen it showed it but in my text editor it wasn't there. i've never seen that before.
[20:36:30] <tina> sorry, in the js not html
[20:37:03] <tina> it was after the last bracket for some reason but i twasn't a space it was just not visible.
[20:37:12] <tina> not sure what that's all about but your code works.
[20:37:23] <tina> thanks so much coldhead.
[20:37:23] <coldhead> jsfiddle has been doing that kind of thing lately
[20:37:29] <coldhead> it's not helpful
[20:37:34] <coldhead> happy hacking tina
[20:37:57] <coldhead> bot-t: tell thinkxl http://jsfiddle.net/QnpDm/1/ ya hooligan
[20:37:57] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[20:38:01] <coldhead> thanks babe
[20:38:46] <coldhead> THE ROOTS AND THE RUINS ARE THE SAME THING
[20:40:59] <dblosevn> tina: jsfiddle adds that crap char to the bottom of the code :-(
[20:43:13] <tina> thanks coldhead and dblosevn! i'll keep that in mind when using jsfiddle.
[20:54:42] <relipse> OnKeyDown and OnChange in input1, how do I put the lowercase value of input 1 into input 2?
[21:02:51] <coldhead> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/xaznJ/
[21:03:39] <coldhead> GET TO FIVE GREAT NAMES
[21:08:31] <relipse> coldhead: thanks but why the setTimeout?
[21:08:54] <coldhead> take it out and you'll see
[21:09:01] <coldhead> it's an ugly hack but i couldn't find a better way
[21:13:35] <dblosevn> coldhead: this.value.toLowercase()
[21:14:02] <dblosevn> little cleaner instead of making it a jqobj etting a string then lowercasing it
[21:15:22] <dblosevn> oh i misread the problem, id do keyup instead so the key is already in the box or add it to the box in the handler lowercase and return false
[21:17:36] <coldhead> i don't do non-jQuery JS
[21:17:39] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/FPx8N/
[21:17:41] <coldhead> the DOM terrifies me
[21:17:54] <dblosevn> no need to init a jq to get the dom element you already have
[21:18:15] <dblosevn> *a jqObj
[21:18:27] <coldhead> there is a need if you're scared of accessing .value directly
[21:18:28] <coldhead> which i am
[21:18:29] <w00tner> i have  div where i drop some elements... image and text... is it posible to save the content of a div and save it as a image ?
[21:19:00] <dblosevn> that handles it in one line, and eliminates the timeout
[21:19:34] <coldhead> it's a much nicer solution, dblosevn
[21:19:49] <coldhead> but it messes with things that i am not allowed to mess with
[21:20:01] <dblosevn> i dont get why on keypress though, the text isnt in the box yet
[21:20:22] <coldhead> it's a bitter mystery
[21:20:56] <dblosevn> well i actually understand im assuming keypress is a synonym for keydown, in which the key wouldnt be in the box yet and you could reject it if you wish
[21:21:53] <coldhead> there are three events: keydown, keypress and keyup
[21:21:58] <coldhead> i forget which order they go in
[21:22:08] <coldhead> but they are different
[21:22:12] <dblosevn> probally press, down, up
[21:24:26] <dblosevn> ah keypress and keydown are synonyms to an extent but keydown is only fired once if a user holds a key, keypress is fired each time a char is repeated
[21:25:00] <relipse> weird
[21:25:08] <relipse> that means keyup is the best
[21:25:11] <relipse> along with onchange()
[21:25:15] <relipse> just in case the user pastes
[21:25:21] <relipse> or maybe mouse click
[21:25:25] <dblosevn> which kind of makes sense, onchange is a little different isnt fired when youd like it to be
[21:25:39] <dblosevn> its not fired until blur in most cases in most browsers
[21:25:47] <relipse> true
[21:25:51] <relipse> but at least it is solid
[21:26:04] <relipse> works with pastes and stuf
[21:26:13] <dblosevn> i like keyup because even with the key repeating problem you eventually have to take your finger off the key
[21:26:34] <dblosevn> or keyup change
[21:26:35] <relipse> why not both keyup and click
[21:26:52] <relipse> orgname.keydown(texttypeorkeydown).keyup(texttypeorkeydown).change(texttypeorkeydown);
[21:26:52] <dblosevn> that would work to
[21:26:57] <relipse> i did that actually
[21:27:01] <dblosevn> hmm
[21:27:25] <dblosevn> ogname.bind('keyup click', function() {} ); would be cleaner
[21:27:31] <relipse> oh neat, thanks
[21:27:50] <coldhead> dblosevn++
[21:27:53] <dblosevn> np
[21:28:30] <dblosevn> sorry .on not bind bind is depreciated
[21:28:48] <dblosevn> damn memory of mine lol
[21:28:54] <relipse> what?
[21:28:54] <coldhead> they can stop me using bind() when they pry it from my cold head hands
[21:29:06] <dblosevn> dead even lol
[21:29:09] <relipse> so i use .on('keyup click')
[21:29:13] <dblosevn> ya
[21:29:13] <coldhead> oops :P
[21:29:16] <relipse> k thanks
[21:29:37] <dblosevn> i like bind, unbind much better then .on, .off
[21:30:04] <dblosevn> i think bind and unbind are a lot more clear, then on and off
[21:30:24] <dblosevn> even if it is a couple more chars
[21:32:04] <Cork> dblosevn: then use bind and delegate, its completely fine
[21:32:06] <coldhead> i don't think bind will really be removed in our lifetimes
[21:32:10] <Cork> they do the exact same thing anyway
[21:32:20] <Cork> me neither
[21:32:29] <coldhead> $.fn.bind = $.fn.on and case closed
[21:32:32] <Cork> theres no need to
[21:32:39] <Cork> coldhead: it already is
[21:32:42] <coldhead> there might be some day
[21:32:43] <dblosevn> i know but if its been "depreciated", some goof may actually remove them at some point lol
[21:32:47] <coldhead> when they remove the alias
[21:33:06] <coldhead> but we'll all be using mootools 4 by then
[21:33:06] <Cork> dblosevn: no bind and delegate isn't depricated
[21:33:11] <Cork> dblosevn: only live is
[21:33:39] <dblosevn> oh thought i got yelled at in here one day over bind, unbind and got preached to about on and off lol
[21:33:58] <relipse> oh geeze, why can't we just refer to the Actual documentation
[21:33:59] <Cork> heh, ya they "recommend" it in the docs
[21:34:14] <Cork> but thats completely different to deprecated
[21:34:32] <dblosevn> i just trusted it didnt feel like reading it
[21:34:38] <coldhead> if JS had a method missing we could do a version called proQuery where .anything() would invoke .on()
[21:34:47] <coldhead> then you could do $('fo').lightMyFire();
[21:34:48] <dblosevn> lol, cant rememebr who said it, was prolly Cork lol
[21:35:04] <Cork> dblosevn: definitely not
[21:35:11] <dblosevn> lol totally kidding
[21:35:15] <coldhead> it was probably rmurphey
[21:35:19] <Cork> i don't preach about on/off, never have never will :)
[21:35:21] <coldhead> that dude hates people using bind()
[21:35:41] <coldhead> BinaryKitten is up to yelling about it too
[21:35:48] <coldhead> made some kids cry
[21:35:53] <coldhead> but i suppose it's for the best
[21:35:55] <dblosevn> thats who it was lol
[21:36:00] <Cork> dblosevn: theres almost no need to remove support for bind; today this is all the code that exist for bind => bind: function( types, data, fn ) { return this.on( types, null, data, fn ); },
[21:36:17] <Cork> you would only save a few bytes by removing it...
[21:36:28] <coldhead> then it absolutely must be removed
[21:36:33] <Cork> lol
[21:36:37] <coldhead> think what we could use those 12 bytes for!
[21:36:44] <Cork> :D
[21:36:48] <dblosevn> porn :-)
[21:36:56] <coldhead> 6 smilies!
[21:37:01] <coldhead> or 3 smilies with noses!
[21:37:05] <dblosevn> get a partial mp4 header out of that
[21:37:10] <coldhead> hahahaha
[21:37:43] <dblosevn> why do people have to be idiots
[21:38:10] <coldhead> in my case it's due to a brain injury i incurred during the rigours of childbirth
[21:38:17] <Cork> lol
[21:38:29] <dblosevn> I hired a guy on elance to do a .net project for me i just really dont have time to do, from the US even and he only read half the specs then whined when i told him he was only half done and wants more money
[21:38:31] <coldhead> say what you like about my mother, she is not a big enough woman to pass a human skull undamaged
[21:38:31] <Cork> coldhead: you can alway make me laugh :)
[21:38:59] <coldhead> that sucks db
[21:39:02] <Forbidd3n> using the jquery validation plugin, anyone know how to set rules for required based on another fields select value?
[21:39:38] <Cork> i know it's doable, but no not much more then that
[21:39:47] <dblosevn> ill probally end up canceling the project and doing it myself, as it is ive already billed more hours consulting with him to get it done then were paying him
[21:40:04] <Cork> Forbidd3n: check its documentation or dig into its code
[21:40:06] <relipse> does anyone know how http://snag.gy/ allows pasting a file or image to work?
[21:40:07] <Forbidd3n> Cork: thanks. I figured it was doable, just can't seem to figure it out based on the documentation
[21:40:11] <Cork> Forbidd3n: its fairly easy
[21:40:32] <Forbidd3n> Cork: if it were that easy, I wouldn't be seeking help.
[21:40:34] <Forbidd3n> :)
[21:40:50] <Forbidd3n> I have the docs open, browsing through them.
[21:40:51] <dblosevn> relipse: ive wondered that myself about gmail
[21:40:51] <Cork> Forbidd3n: have you tried looking at the uncompressed plugin?
[21:41:27] <Forbidd3n> no, you would think it would be in the documentation instead of having to thumb through code. I guess if that is the only option, then...
[21:41:28] <Cork> relipse: prob onpaste event + data-uri
[21:41:34] <dblosevn> relipse: I paste screenshots in gmail all the time, and just never really had time to figure it out, it makes data urls out of it
[21:42:29] <Cork> ugg, no...
[21:42:50] <Cork> they'r using java and flash O_o'
[21:42:58] <Cork> applet : 'http://snag.gy/assets/Paster.jar',
[21:42:58] <Cork> appletClass : 'Snaggy_Pasting_Tool.class',
[21:42:58] <Cork> clipboard : 'http://snag.gy/assets/js/ZeroClipboard.swf',
[21:43:03] * Cork cries in a corner
[21:43:12] <dblosevn> lol i bet google doesnt require flash
[21:44:02] <Cork> its fairly easy to do in pure js too
[21:44:12] <Cork> not the best of browser support though
[21:44:32] <dblosevn> http://strd6.com/2011/09/html5-javascript-pasting-image-data-in-chrome/
[21:44:43] <dblosevn> theres a jquery plugin that does it
[21:48:50] * tw2113 gives Cork a $() to calm him
[21:49:56] * Cork snuggles with the $()
[21:50:19] <dblosevn> ya i just tried that in chrome, ff, and safari, only worked in chrome and firefox, i didnt even bother with ie lol
[21:50:44] <Cork> ya, cause it uses onpaste
[21:50:52] <Cork> ?mdn onpaste
[21:50:53] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "mdn onpaste" in jQuery Docs.
[21:50:54] <hateIE> hey i want to return the response the result of a ajax call in my function how can you do that..
[21:50:55] <Cork> ?mdc onpaste
[21:50:58] <bot-t> Cork, element.onpaste - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - The onpaste property returns the onPaste event handler code on the current element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.onpaste
[21:51:05] <Cork> hateIE: you can't
[21:51:44] <hateIE> well I am apauled and disgusted.
[21:51:50] <dblosevn> Cork++: harsh but true
[21:51:50] <Cork> hateIE: return the jqXHR object and use it's daisychain callbacks to get the data where you need it
[21:52:50] <Cork> hateIE: function test() { return $.ajax(); };  function other() { return test().done(function() {}); }; other().fail(function() {});
[21:52:56] <dblosevn> or simply call the function that needs the data from the callback
[21:53:40] <dblosevn> or even better make that function be the callback lol
[21:53:47] <coldhead> appalled*
[21:54:04] <dblosevn> lil late i was gonna let it slide coldhead: lol
[21:54:05] <hateIE> hah
[21:54:53] <coldhead> paul irish is gonna see that when he searches the logs for "paul"
[21:55:01] <coldhead> i didn't want to disappoint him by not correcting it
[21:55:04] <coldhead> we're all good now, carry on
[21:55:16] <coldhead> I SAID CARRY ON
[21:55:44] <Cork> lol
[21:56:07] <dblosevn> lol
[21:56:38] <coldhead> ¿Cómo puedo cargar un bollo de cerdo en jQuery?
[21:56:45] <hateIE> if you made a global jquery variable ... would that not work.. i dont really get why global js vars cant be assigned from the callback of $ajax/$post .. but yet you can can access dom elements with a selector
[21:56:49] <dblosevn> ?english @coldhead
[21:56:49] <bot-t> coldhead, Ingles por favor English Please Anglais s'il vous plait Englisch bitte..
[21:56:53] <Cork> hateIE: no
[21:57:05] <coldhead> hahaha
[21:57:10] <Cork> hateIE: ajax is async, so you would have race conditions if you don't use the callbacks
[21:58:06] <hateIE> well yeh im not suggesting to not use them .. i am suggesting tha global vars should be in there scope
[21:58:16] <coldhead> their*
[21:58:29] <dblosevn> hateIE: and yet the globals are in there scope
[21:59:00] <dblosevn> as well as the function that called the post to begin with
[21:59:20] <dblosevn> just because its a callback doesnt change how scope works in javascript
[22:00:13] <dblosevn> i myself try to never cloud the global scope though and find ways to not need global vars
[22:00:23] <dblosevn> *global namespace not scope
[22:01:30] <dblosevn> eg storing the data where its generally needed in the dome with .data for instance
[22:01:40] <dblosevn> *dom even wow i cant type lmao
[22:02:15] <dblosevn> or within the scope of the onready where ill be needing it
[22:16:38] <relipse> coldhead
[22:16:52] <relipse> can you help me with the 3 plans located here (css issues) http://clearbugs.com/register.php
[22:20:33] <tw2113> relipse, helps to mention the issues
[22:21:13] <relipse> tw2113: lol the issues are obvious
[22:21:19] <relipse> the text goes outside of the box
[22:21:22] <relipse> it looks just plain ugly
[22:22:38] <coldhead> you have to make the font smaller
[22:22:40] <coldhead> or the box wider
[22:22:50] <coldhead> or you can do .planbox {overflow:hidden}
[22:22:50] <tw2113> #css
[22:22:50] <tw2113> this is #jquery
[22:22:50] <tw2113> remove the px based height too
[22:22:53] <coldhead> but no one will like that
[22:23:24] <coldhead> or you can do .planbox {overflow:hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;}
[22:23:30] <tw2113> wars will be waged depending on how you handle
[22:23:31] <coldhead> which is elite but spluh
[22:25:21] <tw2113> god! you're such an elitist coldhead
[22:35:30] <coldhead> read a book sometime, tw2113
[22:35:48] <coldhead> et hoc genus onne
[22:51:28] <defaultro> hey guys, I'm trying to add a class to <div id="section1"> using $("#section1").attr('class','newClass'); but it's not adding it
[22:51:43] <tw2113> addClass
[22:52:35] <tw2113> $('#section1').addClass('newClass')
[22:52:37] <defaultro> i tried that too and it didn't work
[22:52:46] <defaultro> but when I try it in Firebug, it works
[22:53:06] <dblosevn> defaultro: then your doing it before the element exists in the dom
[22:53:07] <defaultro> maybe, it hasn't loaded yet
[22:53:16] <defaultro> yeah, that's what I ws thinkign
[22:53:46] <dblosevn> do it either in dom ready or if the element is being injected into the dom after injecting it
[22:54:03] <defaultro> k
[22:55:32] <defaultro> oh, it worked. What i wrote earlier was form.find('#section1').addClass('newClass');
[22:55:44] <defaultro> I changed form.find with $
[22:56:01] <defaultro> i'm just copying how the other developer used form.find
[22:57:01] <dblosevn> ya its worthless to do form.find an id should only exist on the page once... $('#section1') is correct
[22:57:04] <defaultro> is there a difference between this too
[22:57:26] <defaultro> $('.first.second') and $('.first .second')
[22:57:38] <dblosevn> ya
[22:57:41] <defaultro> second one has space
[22:58:04] <defaultro> <div class="first second">
[22:58:16] <defaultro> what's proper way of referencing to that
[22:58:29] <dblosevn> .first.second means the element has both classes first and second, .first .second means it will match an element with the class .second thats a child of .first
[22:58:48] <coldhead> same as CSS
[22:58:52] <defaultro> ah
[22:59:30] <defaultro> thanks! :)
[23:00:22] <defaultro> can i do this .attr('class','firstclass secondclass'); or should I separate them?
[23:00:31] <dblosevn> no....
[23:00:42] <dblosevn> attr class is totally wrong never ever use that
[23:00:43] <defaultro> so write 2 lines
[23:00:48] <defaultro> it worked for me
[23:01:01] <defaultro> i'll use addClass
[23:01:01] <dblosevn> thats a mott point, never do that
[23:01:05] <dblosevn> *moot even
[23:01:20] <dblosevn> .addClass('first second')
[23:01:24] <defaultro> k
[23:02:04] <dblosevn> if the element happens to have other classes assigned to it as well you will overwrite them with .attr and a class isnt even an attribute anyways className is a property
[23:02:46] <defaultro> cool
[23:14:04] <w00tner> guys
[23:14:13] <w00tner> how do i append a data contained in a variable
[23:14:15] <w00tner> $('#addTexto').append('<p class="customText"> valText </p>')
[23:15:38] <tw2113> $('#addTexto').append('<p class="customText">'+valText+'</p>')
[23:17:50] <w00tner> thanks
[23:20:46] <w00tner> i add the text to a div using a field form and it works great... it uses a class customText
[23:20:55] <w00tner> how can i change the font-face
[23:21:01] <tw2113> css
[23:21:05] <w00tner> addClass ?
[23:21:09] <relipse>  why does height: 80% work for a input element inside a <form> in Chrome but not in Firefox (really really small)
[23:21:29] <BinaryKitten> w00tner font-face or font-family/
[23:21:46] <tw2113> both of which are CSS
[23:22:02] <BinaryKitten> tw2113 true, but 1 you can add via jquery
[23:22:13] <relipse> tw2113: you ever go into a coffee shop and not talk about coffee?
[23:22:15] <BinaryKitten> the other not so much (well you can but not easy)
[23:22:22] <w00tner> yes but i want to give font types in a menu, when the user click on a Font it automaticaly changes the text
[23:22:39] <BinaryKitten> w00tner i would go with classes then
[23:22:52] <BinaryKitten> toggleClass
[23:23:00] <BinaryKitten> will add or remove a particular class
[23:23:01] <tw2113> set up some css classes that use each font you want
[23:23:07] <tw2113> and then use jquery to toggle the classes
[23:23:10] <BinaryKitten> ?.toggleClass @ w00tner
[23:23:10] <bot-t> w00tner, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[23:23:17] <w00tner> nice man
[23:23:21] <w00tner> just what i need
[23:24:15] <w00tner> is there a wway just to change one class ?
[23:24:37] <w00tner> oooh
[23:24:42] <w00tner> i can add multiple classes
[23:24:44] <w00tner> duh
[23:24:51] <w00tner> i just got it =)
[23:26:06] <tcberner> good morning
[23:27:05] <w00tner> good morning
[23:30:47] <tcberner> I have a dynamically created filter widget. http://user.math.uzh.ch/berner/files/filter.png . Now I want to add a keypress event so that one can press just "enter" instead of the + button
[23:31:03] <tcberner> How can I get witch textbox the keyevent came from?
[23:31:28] <Cork> this?
[23:32:32] <tcberner> I'm using $dcoument.keypress at the moment, so this is not really usefull  I think
[23:32:54] <Cork> $(document).on('keypress', 'input', function() {});
[23:33:27] <Cork> or $(document).delegate('input', 'keypress', function() {}); if you're on an older version
[23:34:27] <Cork> tcberner: that said; you should have a form around you're fields to capture the enter keys
[23:34:28] <BinaryKitten> $(document).on('keypress', 'input[type=text], textarea', function() {});
[23:34:47] <tcberner> Ok, so that would be similar to how I added the + function. $("#filter_hook").on('click', button_add_sl ,{moo}).
[23:35:51] <BinaryKitten> $(<closestParentThatDoesntChange>).on(event, 'child selector', evtFunction)
[23:36:11] <tcberner> can I call the dynamic button-click I created?
[23:36:20] <BinaryKitten> yep
[23:36:27] <tcberner> cool
[23:36:33] <BinaryKitten> but would be easier to and cleaner to click the button
[23:36:44] <BinaryKitten> buttonYouStoredEarlier.click()
[23:36:54] <tcberner> yes, but I was asked to add the key-event by the users
[23:37:00] <BinaryKitten> or $(buttonSelector).click();
[23:37:15] <BinaryKitten> tcberner i mean in code
[23:37:19] <BinaryKitten> rather than calling the function
[23:37:35] <BinaryKitten> that way if you change the function, this still works appropriately
[23:37:46] <BinaryKitten> you might also want a debouncer
[23:38:12] <BinaryKitten> ala http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[23:40:00] <tcberner> ok
[23:46:25] <w00tner> Binary, so i create a bunch of clases for each font, each color and each size
[23:47:57] <defaultro> is anyone still awake? :)
[23:48:17] <defaultro> because I would like to know what this code does
[23:48:57] <defaultro> if (!$(form.find("form")[0]).valid()) { ............... } else { .......... }
[23:49:25] <BinaryKitten> w00tner possibly   again the actualy implementation is up to you
[23:49:35] <defaultro> looks like it's searching for a form
[23:50:00] <BinaryKitten> yep
[23:50:05] <BinaryKitten> and doing it badly too
[23:50:20] <defaultro> is that for me BinaryKitten
[23:50:29] <BinaryKitten> yeah sorry defaultro
[23:50:43] <defaultro> oh ok. I didn't write it. What does it really do?
[23:50:56] <BinaryKitten> " if (!$(form.find("form")[0]).valid()) {  "  = find the form tag inside the element stored in the form variable
[23:51:00] <BinaryKitten> sorry
[23:51:08] <defaultro> k
[23:51:13] <BinaryKitten> find all form tags inside the element stored in the form variable
[23:51:27] <defaultro> k
[23:51:28] <BinaryKitten> then grab the 1st one and pass that back to jquery
[23:51:43] <BinaryKitten> then check if that's not valid
[23:51:57] <defaultro> k. It's failing
[23:51:59] <BinaryKitten> if (!form.find("form").first().valid()) {
[23:52:07] <BinaryKitten> would be a nicer way
[23:52:12] <defaultro> I'll try that
[23:52:19] <BinaryKitten> failing in what way?  not validating
[23:52:24] <BinaryKitten> or not doing anything
[23:52:35] <defaultro> it goes to the first { }
[23:52:40] <defaultro> since it's invalid
[23:52:45] <defaultro> but not sure why it's invalid
[23:52:54] <BinaryKitten> check the validation rules
[23:52:59] <defaultro> k
[23:53:14] <BinaryKitten> depending on the validation library these might be attached to the elements as data-valdate
[23:53:21] <BinaryKitten> or somewhere earlier in the code
[23:53:21] <defaultro> k
[23:53:37] <defaultro> so that code you wrote won't fix it?
[23:54:27] <BinaryKitten> if the form is invalid it's invalid
[23:54:33] <BinaryKitten> the code isn't broken
[23:54:36] <defaultro> got it
[23:54:59] <defaultro> looks like the form validation that was added is returning something that I cannot see in the form
[23:55:11] <BinaryKitten> but the code i gave you is a better form of the other one which is doing a pointless get item and wrap
[23:55:17] <defaultro> k
[23:55:39] <BinaryKitten> sorry can't be more help, am running late for work
[23:55:48] <defaultro> cool
[23:55:52] <defaultro> thanks a lot!!!
