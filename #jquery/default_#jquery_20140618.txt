[00:01:24] <jphase> yeah I don't really know what you're doing - a bit tough without seeing the html and such, but it looks like you're trying to load in images?
[00:01:46] <Oreolek> yes
[00:01:57] <jphase> not really sure what the reloadBanner() function is for with an interval either
[00:02:08] <Oreolek> every 10 seconds i need to rotate the banners
[00:02:22] <Oreolek> there are 4 .banner divs, several need to contain >1 image
[00:02:44] <jphase> okay
[00:03:35] <Oreolek> so on page load I load the list with every banner there is. Next every 10 or so seconds i fade them out, empty and switch new images
[00:04:05] <Oreolek> it works fast enough and i can show the banners in the order, not randomly
[00:04:24] <Oreolek> (yes, I have a horrible boss that wants to show all banners in order, not randomly)
[00:07:27] <jphase> well it looks like you have some async events happening so you'd want to call the fadeIn() from populateBanner() instead
[00:07:31] <jphase> no?
[00:07:50] <hocza> how is it possible to make a carousel pagination like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/dziiz2x8a76anyu/4.png
[00:09:51] <Oreolek> I dunno, but populateBanner is supposed to be synchronous. It's fadeIn/fadeOut that have an async callback.
[00:10:04] <Oreolek> but thanks anyway, i'll try that
[00:12:02] <jphase> well the loading of the images is what I meant as opposed to the async .get call
[00:12:12] <jphase> hocza: css?
[00:14:31] <hocza> jphase: anyhow. I just couldn't find any live example. But the designer provided me this as an 'ideal scene'
[00:15:10] <b0t> Hello guys
[00:15:12] <hocza> jphase: but IIRC I did not see anything like that. :)
[00:15:13] <b0t> One question
[00:16:01] <jphase> hocza: yeah it'd be something custom for sure - I use owlcarousel as my carousel of choice but styles like that for navigation would be custom
[00:16:29] <b0t> How to return the default values on ('.footer').css('display', 'inline-block');
[00:19:45] <hocza> hm the boss provided me a displayProduct plugin, and it uses jQuery OwlCarousel v1.29 :)
[00:20:03] <Cork> b0t: you can't
[00:20:19] <Cork> b0t: or if you mean reset it to the browser default
[00:20:26] <Cork> set .css('display', '')
[00:35:33] <antlong_> can anyone recommend a plugin for achievements, or badges? something for gamification
[00:42:24] <rethus> what means the ng shorcut in angular (for example: ng-app) What means ng ?
[00:51:59] <Tad3j> rethus, ng stands for angular, and you should basically look at the whole attribute name
[00:52:54] <Tad3j> also #angularjs might be a better place for related questions I believe
[00:53:25] <rethus> yes, but I only need a way to remember this shortcut. To know what it mean is a good way to remember the exact writing of it.
[00:53:34] <rethus> thanks you, now i see.
[00:53:49] <rethus> aNGular  = NG = ng.  :)
[00:55:20] <Bizari> Indeed! :)
[01:01:05] <DarsVaeda> somehow I don't see why only the second slider works and the first controls the second...I thought I kept the context to each? http://jsfiddle.net/5M6AE/

[01:02:04] <Cork> DarsVaeda: you're varialbes are global

[01:02:25] <DarsVaeda> where is that var gone -.-
[01:02:47] <DarsVaeda> thanks I could have looked at this for hours I'm sure ^^
[01:03:21] <DarsVaeda> I need a better highlighter :/
[01:06:51] <damiano> hello friends
[01:07:00] <damiano> i am using .slideDown() method...
[01:07:15] <damiano> the problem is that i can not assign an height to the element but ONLY min-height
[01:07:43] <damiano> how can i animate (show the div) to height:104px ?
[01:09:43] <tiblock> Hi. Is there any "books" about what you should do in jquery for optimization? Like "do not do like $('div span .message .block a') this will overload. Do ID in hrefs you need."
[01:11:25] <Cork> damiano: set the height to 104px in the css
[01:11:34] <Cork> and run .hide() on ready
[01:11:39] <damiano> Cork, i cant
[01:11:48] <damiano> i mean...if i set height:104px in the css
[01:12:04] <damiano> the height will be fixed (obviosuly) the problem is that inside this div
[01:12:22] <damiano> there is an element that overlay the div because its content increase
[01:12:32] <damiano> so i have to "follow" the height of the inner elements
[01:12:41] <damiano> with min-height it works perfectly
[01:12:44] <Cork> so you want to animate to 104 and then snap the last bit?
[01:12:55] <damiano> but slideDown() does not slide down...i see no effect
[01:13:06] <Cork> ya, you set min-height
[01:13:19] <damiano> Cork, i have this element #overlay... it has display:none;
[01:13:20] <Cork> slideDown animates by changing the height value
[01:13:30] <damiano> then i would like to show it with slideDown() effect
[01:13:45] <Cork> but as you have min-height the value will be ignored until it is at least as large as min-height
[01:13:45] <damiano> but i noticed that if i does not set up the height....the slidedown has no effects
[01:14:01] <damiano> cork try to use slideDown without height
[01:14:12] <Cork> what do you mean?
[01:14:13] <damiano> you will see the element without any slidedown() effects
[01:14:30] <damiano> i mean... slideDown(10000) it will keep 10 seconds to "open" the div
[01:14:41] <damiano> if i does not set the "height" i see all the height directly
[01:14:45] <damiano> without effects
[01:15:00] <damiano> if i set the height: 104px; i correctly see the effect
[01:15:11] <ThoMe> hiho
[01:15:13] <Cork> damiano: http://jsfiddle.net/8d279/
[01:15:26] <damiano> but as i told you before i can not set it...becase i need more height inside (if a specifc element height increase)
[01:15:28] <damiano> Cork,  i see
[01:15:52] <Cork> damiano: are you using float on the child elements?
[01:16:01] <ThoMe> how ii can with jquery mobile a label and select box in the same line and the distance to reduce between label and select box
[01:16:04] <ThoMe> ?
[01:16:27] <damiano> Cork, maybe because my @oerlay element is "displaY:none" at the beginning
[01:16:27] <damiano> ?
[01:17:00] <Cork> damiano: in this case, no http://jsfiddle.net/8d279/1/
[01:17:02] <Cork> but yes it might be
[01:17:18] <Cork> display: none will break things if the default display value for the element isn't block
[01:17:26] <Cork> cause then it will be display: inline
[01:17:29] <Cork> and things will break
[01:17:43] <Cork> so normally you want .hide() instead of display: none;
[01:18:49] <damiano> Cork, pardon... pvt
[01:34:33] <abishek> I have a basic question with removing items from an array. I have an array with 10 items. I am looping through array using $.each and removing an 3 specific items. When I remove them, the loop gets messed up and throws an error as it is not able to complete the loop because the items were removed during the loop. For a situation like this, how should I loop and remove them? $.each
[01:36:42] <systemfault> If you don’t need to support IE8 (Or you use es5-shim with IE8), you can use .filter
[01:40:41] <Cork> abishek: use $.grep
[01:41:25] <jphase> I keep forgetting about that
[01:42:56] <systemfault> If it didn’t have such a ridiculous name… it wouldn’t be as easy to forget it.
[02:10:24] <fpghost84> In the draggable docs, it shows that you can inoke a function on drag with "drag: function( e, ui ) {.....}", is it possible to call a function defined elsewhere here? e.g. "drag: myDragFunc(e, ui), "? I keep getting reference 'e' undefined like that, but it works if the func is defined inline...
[02:13:01] <Cork> fpghost84: drag: myDragFunc,
[02:14:05] <DarsVaeda> not sure this is exactly jquery...how are images loaded if I change the display property of the parent?
[02:14:24] <Cork> DarsVaeda: depends on the browser
[02:14:29] <DarsVaeda> will they be loaded on ie. display: block
[02:14:31] <fpghost84> Cork: ah thanks!
[02:14:35] <DarsVaeda> or are they just "hidden"
[02:14:44] <Cork> but most modern browsers fetch the source but doesn't render or decode it
[02:15:20] <DarsVaeda> hmm okay I have a content pushing issue I can't wrap my head around, I guess it is because the image space is not occupied when setting display: block
[02:15:31] <Cork> if they have been drawn and you then hide them again they are kept (and just hidden) until memory pressure makes the browser throw it away
[02:15:47] <DarsVaeda> oh okay then it is something else, thanks :)
[02:21:40] <ornerymoose_> ‘Please select’ is the initial value for the dropdown menu. The change method is not working when switched to other values nor when swithced back to initial values. How would I fix this? http://codeshare.io/HZRP6
[02:25:10] <Cork> ornerymoose_: don't use attr for disabled
[02:25:18] <Cork> it isn't meant for that; or cross browser supported
[02:25:28] <Anticom> Hi all
[02:25:30] <Anticom> hey Cork
[02:25:35] <Cork> you want prop('disabled', true/false);
[02:25:42] <Anticom> somehow i can't figure out, how to get this theme working: http://jquery-ui-bootstrap.github.io/jquery-ui-bootstrap/components.html#autocomplete
[02:25:56] <Anticom> in the github.io page i only see bootstrap and theme css included
[02:25:59] <Anticom> and there it works
[02:26:08] <Anticom> but when i do that on my site, the css breaks :/
[02:26:29] <ornerymoose_> cork: thank you, will try prop
[02:26:30] <Cork> Anticom: hard to say, might be your css conflict
[02:26:53] <Cork> ornerymoose_: basically don't use attr unless prop explicitly gives you the wrong result
[02:27:09] <Cork> (and it only does in some very specific cases)
[02:27:24] <Anticom> Cork found it... he's using bootstrap 2
[02:27:26] <Anticom> :/
[02:27:32] <ornerymoose_> ok will do, give me a moment here
[02:29:16] <ornerymoose_> cork: well i guess the bigger problem here is the .change method, because when i switch back to the initial value of ‘Please select’, it doesnt become disabled
[02:30:05] <Cork> ornerymoose_: please make a jsfiddle.net of the problem
[02:30:27] <ornerymoose_> sure one sec
[02:31:04] <Cork> (that means you need to include something to represent the select element and the one you want to disable)
[02:32:29] <Woodoo> hi
[02:37:13] <ornerymoose_> cork: so this is janky and kinda works, just not when u go back to the ‘Please select’ value: it should become disabled again http://jsfiddle.net/ggCAD/7/
[02:38:25] <Anticom> typo in my rel-attribute
[02:38:27] <Anticom> ba dum tssss
[02:39:05] <yocapybara> guys is there a usual suspect as to what is wrong when using jquery ui-sortable - it totally works fine on Chrome, but doesn't seem active on Safari? (but no errors in console?)
[02:39:37] <Cork> ornerymoose_: http://jsfiddle.net/ggCAD/8/
[02:40:02] <yocapybara> I can see in Safari that it is being assigned the ui-sortable class correctly, but dragging is dead
[02:40:09] <ornerymoose_> oh wow you can set an actual val in .prop…that is cool.
[02:40:27] <Cork> ornerymoose_: no it is a comparison
[02:40:35] <Cork> the ==
[02:40:54] <ornerymoose_> oh right sorry i mistyped. disable if the val is Please select
[02:41:03] <Cork> ya
[02:41:08] <ornerymoose_> right on, thanks man
[02:41:11] <Cork> np
[02:52:13] <glambert> anyone use the lazyload plugin and know of a way of displaying the image when it's rendered rather than when it's loaded?
[02:58:56] <hocza> when I receive $.get 's callback 'data', how can I select one element's content? forexample: data = "<h1>test<h1><span>1234</span>" and I want to get the span's content only. :)
[02:59:33] <sacho_> parse the data into dom elements, e.g. via $(data).
[03:01:43] <hocza> wow, works like miracle. :)
[03:01:49] <abishek> does someone here have experience with keymaster library? https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster I am trying to setup the combination shift+up, but can seem to attach to it
[03:01:50] <hocza> or something like that...
[03:01:53] <hocza> thanks sacho_ !
[03:02:26] <hocza> I did not think that it would be that easy. :)
[03:03:47] <Cork> note though if you are going to use unknown sources you might want to use $($.parseHTML(data))
[03:04:07] <Cork> as $(data) might break depending on the content of the html string
[03:08:22] <sacho_> yeah, actually, $.parseHTML is a better idea, but I still wouldn't use it on an untrusted source.
[03:08:42] <Cork> well i didn't mean fully untrusted :)
[03:08:53] <Cork> more just "source you don't have full control over"
[03:09:07] <Cork> as simple things like space at the wrong place might crash $(data)
[03:13:10] <[1]domino> hello!
[03:14:01] <[1]domino> i have a proble in understand how post and $.ajax works
[03:14:16] <Cork> you mean normal post or $.post?
[03:15:16] <[1]domino> i mean $.ajax({ url:'blalb', data: form.serializeArray(), ....
[03:15:40] <[1]domino> with prevent default
[03:16:56] <[1]domino> when i write data: form.serializeArray(),  in php i recive the $_POST whit all the field of the form as ['key'] => Value
[03:17:42] <sacho_> that's nice
[03:18:03] <[1]domino> but if i write data: {form: form.serializeArray(), morevalue : 'valueadd'}
[03:18:54] <Cork> you would get ['form[key]'] => Value
[03:19:00] <Cork> or rather
[03:19:09] <Cork> you would get ['form[0][key]'] => Value
[03:19:32] <Cork> [1]domino: you most likely don't want to do it like that
[03:20:03] <sacho_> [1]domino, serializeArray() returns an array - you could use .concat() to add more values.
[03:20:06] <[1]domino> i wold get ['form']['key']=>'value'
[03:20:22] <Cork> var fields = form.serializeArray(); fields.push({ key: 'morevalue', value: 'valueadd'});
[03:20:30] <Cork> and data: fields,
[03:22:05] <[1]domino> ok i'll try, but the other strange ting is that also when i write   data: form.serialize(),
[03:22:39] <[1]domino> i recive the $_POST whit all ['key'] => value
[03:23:02] <Cork> [1]domino: it isn't strange
[03:23:12] <[1]domino> but when i try to add more file not from the form the form became a serialized string
[03:23:20] <Cork> you're nesting the array under a key in the params string
[03:23:47] <Cork> [1]domino: and .serialize() generates a string so it isn't a good option for adding more values too
[03:23:51] <Cork> *to
[03:25:00] <[1]domino> ok
[03:25:07] <hocza> sacho_ & Cork: Luckily i have full control over the page that i'm going to $.get :)
[03:25:41] <hocza> however now lunchtime, see you :)
[03:25:42] <Cork> hocza: then note you will have to make sure you don't include leading spaces in the html you send
[03:26:02] <hocza> Cork: ok, i wont :)
[03:26:04] <Cork> or $() will think it is a selector and querySelectorAll will crash
[03:26:16] <Cork> or rather throw
[03:26:19] <hocza> thanks for the notification
[03:26:30] <hocza> *warning
[03:26:35] <hocza> or what:)
[03:26:50] <Cork> it was quite recently changed
[03:26:55] <[1]domino> Cork can i show you the pice of code?
[03:27:00] <Cork> this is a new limitation since 1.9
[03:27:15] <Cork> [1]domino: make a jsfiddle.net
[03:27:28] <hocza> see you
[03:28:26] <bongjovi> I'm trying to pass an XML document via $.ajax / POST to a php file but var_dump($_POST) returns an empty array
[03:28:40] <bongjovi> Seems like I'm not using $.ajax correctly, can anyone help? http://pastebin.com/R103Sisu
[03:29:16] <Cork> bongjovi: to start with, it is application/xml not text/xml
[03:29:37] <[1]domino> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=yb1nplG2CL
[03:30:03] <Cork> bongjovi: also dataType doesn't take a value 'text'
[03:30:37] <Cork> [1]domino: click the "save" button
[03:30:42] <Cork> and post the new url
[03:30:50] <bongjovi> Ah, okay thanks. Still the same result though with chose changes.
[03:30:57] <[1]domino> http://jsfiddle.net/L2gdw/
[03:31:56] <Cork> [1]domino: that code should work just fine
[03:32:19] <[1]domino> yes this work
[03:32:24] <[1]domino> but if i change
[03:33:06] <bongjovi> Cork: According to http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ dataType does accept "text"?
[03:33:14] <[1]domino> data: form.serializeArray(),  in data: {form:form.serializeArray(), test:'123'},
[03:33:55] <Cork> bongjovi: ah.. sorry i checked listing at the top not the longer version
[03:34:39] <bongjovi> np, I don't think it makes a difference anyway
[03:34:46] <bongjovi> in this situation
[03:36:20] <[1]domino> my $_POST became 2 array 1 [form][0][name]=>fieldname [form][0][value]=>fieldValue .... [form][n][name]=>fieldname [form][n][value]=>fieldValue, and seconcond array [test]=>123
[03:37:17] <[1]domino> i'll like to have inside [form]just [form][filendname]=>'value'
[03:38:04] <Cork> [1]domino: http://jsfiddle.net/L2gdw/1/
[03:38:35] <Cork> or you would have to convert serializeArray into an object
[03:40:55] <[1]domino> ok your modification is very close
[03:41:33] <[1]domino> but i recive [undefined] => 123 insted of [test]=>123
[03:41:46] <Cork> hmm
[03:42:10] <Cork> BAH
[03:42:13] <Cork> its name not key...
[03:46:44] <[1]domino> ok
[03:47:14] <[1]domino> now works
[03:47:31] <[1]domino> so in php an array can have key,name and value
[03:52:50] <jaccob> I think you can use indices or the keys to access the values
[03:53:25] <jaccob> similarily in javascript too I think
[03:53:43] <jaccob> or for sure in js but maybe in php. you have to look it up
[03:54:18] <bongjovi> Is it even possible to send an entire xml document via $.ajax POST?
[03:54:49] <jaccob> bongjovi, of course. although I never did it, I just send form data or json
[03:55:27] <bongjovi> Hmm, I really can't figure this out..

[06:06:02] <MacroMan> I can't seem to call any functions after .get(). eg $(this).get(0).hide(); gives me "undefined is not a function"
[06:06:40] <xec> MacroMan: .get() returns a native dom object, not jquery. maybe you want .eq() instead
[06:06:47] <decx> get returns an array with the native html element, you can.... yes what xec wrote
[06:07:02] <decx> damnyou -.-
[06:07:09] * xec high fives decx
[06:07:12] <decx> o/
[06:07:18] <xec> \o
[06:07:28] <MacroMan> xec, Cheers. That works now.
[06:08:03] <decx> d3m0n oh s owhen you have the feed inside twitter feed already then cycle works?
[06:08:50] <decx> maybe console.log(feed) in your success function. could be gremlins
[06:09:30] <d3m0n> Well, I see the twitter feed on my page too
[06:09:31] <DaAlexMax> I have a question for you guys.  How do cross-domain requests work?  I'm asking because there is a web service that I'm using that nominally doesn't have affordances for cross-domain requests, and I get an error whenever I use $.post() on it, but I find that for some reason the post goes through anyway.
[06:09:44] <d3m0n> The cycle() function just doesn't shoot off
[06:10:34] <DaAlexMax> In other words, I get an error in the console whenever I use $.post on it, but I find that whatever I posted shows up anyway.
[06:10:51] <DaAlexMax> What in the heck is going on here?
[06:11:11] <xec> shows up where? at the external domain server?
[06:11:28] <DaAlexMax> Yeah, I see the results of whatever I posted show up anyway.
[06:11:51] <decx> can you get a demo with some dummy tweets on jsfiddle where you can recreate the problem d3m0n?
[06:11:59] <d3m0n> Yeah sure
[06:12:00] <xec> DaAlexMax: what's the error you get in the console?
[06:12:19] <d3m0n> Oh wait that might be a problem, the api uses a php class file
[06:12:29] <minato> what happens when i give <a href="new.html">new</a> ?because jquery mobile is opening it in his own windows i believe. even though new.html is coded differently it inherits the jquery mobile page which called it.
[06:13:42] <decx> d3m0n just grab a feed locally from your success and just paste it in a var on fiddle ;)
[06:13:57] <d3m0n> I am wondering if that might not work because there would be no load time
[06:14:28] <d3m0n> Let me make up a testcase
[06:14:31] <decx> we're just gonna ignore the ajax part for now
[06:14:49] <d3m0n> Well I know for sure it works without ajax
[06:15:00] <d3m0n> I tested it on a basic list before I implemented with ajax
[06:15:18] <decx> oh, then we must both be missing something
[06:15:41] <decx> where are the attentive americans when you need em, get to work lads
[06:16:04] <d3m0n> It's like 5am for them :P
[06:16:29] <decx> so? what happened to that famous workethic
[06:16:32] <decx> ^^
[06:16:49] <d3m0n> Died in the 50's
[06:16:55] <DaAlexMax> xec: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://other.domain.com/forms/userSubmit.jsp. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://my.domain.com' is therefore not allowed access.
[06:17:03] <decx> log feed in your success function and paste that
[06:17:15] <DaAlexMax> So yeah, in theory, the request shouldn't be going through, but it is
[06:20:24] <d3m0n> Yep, just regular list http://pastebin.com/nmKiaV7r
[06:20:28] <xec> DaAlexMax: that does sound strange indeed. do you see the actual http request being made?
[06:21:20] <xec> like, with fiddler, or the network tab of devtools
[06:21:29] <DaAlexMax> xec: According to wikipedia, Same Origin Policy is only concerned with reading the response.
[06:21:39] <DaAlexMax> ANd yeah, I don't get any results back
[06:21:49] <DaAlexMax> actually not wikipedia
[06:21:52] <DaAlexMax> some stackoverflow post
[06:21:53] <DaAlexMax> "CSRF does not violate the Same-Origin Policy For JavaScript because the SOP is concerned with JavaScript reading the server's response to a clients request. CSRF attacks don't care about the response, they care about a side-effect, "
[06:22:47] <DaAlexMax> The problem is - I'm not sure that this is working in all browsers.  I suspect that some versions of some browsers might not even initiate the side effect.
[06:23:58] <xec> DaAlexMax: i guess it makes some sort of sense, how would you know what headers are present at the external resource without contacting it
[06:24:29] <d3m0n> wow hahahaha
[06:24:32] <xec> but i was under the same impression as you. what SO post are you reading?
[06:24:34] <d3m0n> Dang I am dumb.
[06:24:55] <d3m0n> It was working the whole time. I forgot to display none on all the list items and didnt take the time to wait and look js to make a full cycle
[06:25:04] <decx> haha
[06:25:11] * d3m0n smacks head
[06:25:12] <decx> had to be something like this
[06:25:29] <decx> are you the quake demon?
[06:26:13] <d3m0n> hexen d3m0n
[06:26:36] <d3m0n> lol no i dont go on that network
[06:26:46] <DaAlexMax> xec: Maybe if the cross-origin request simply sent a special kind of HTTP request before sending the real one
[06:26:49] <decx> man i played so much hexen in the 90s
[06:27:00] <DaAlexMax> Dunno
[06:27:14] <d3m0n> Haha, I just bought it on steam to replay it.
[06:27:39] <DaAlexMax> d3m0n, decx: http://www.osnanet.de/c.oelckers/gzdoom/index.html
[06:27:55] <DaAlexMax> This can play hexen at north of 35fps and in OpenGL
[06:28:13] <DaAlexMax> and with full mouselook
[06:29:21] <d3m0n> Haha nice, I literally just finished beating Doom 2
[06:29:38] <Daghdha> if i use async and defer and only start doing stuff in document.ready it can never go wrong right?
[06:29:47] <blowb> hey, i have a function that checks if the url contains a specific parameter value (copied from internet, is working well) http://puu.sh/9yZaj/31f122cfd9.png --- my problem is causes the javascript to not work if the parameter is not in the url. how can i get rid of it ?
[06:29:51] <decx> d3m0n how does .cycle come into play when your endpoint just serves a string with li's and that is includes into .twitter .feed ?
[06:30:16] <decx> is included*
[06:30:20] <xec> Daghdha: that depends on what you mean by "go wrong" i guess
[06:30:46] <d3m0n> decx: You're right I technically could unless I want to reuse it
[06:30:51] <drej> i dont understand how its 2014 and some "developers" still think that the best way to get help in a live forum is to paste SCREENSHOTS OF CODE.
[06:30:51] <Daghdha> By go wrong i mean a script element referring a not yet rendered/parsed section of my page
[06:31:31] <xec> Daghdha: assuming that element is present in the html (as opposed to generated/dynamic content) then yes
[06:31:35] <Daghdha> oh i see defer is good, async is bad. (for me at least) they are not usable simultaniously
[06:33:23] <bongjovi> Anyone used $.ajax POST to pass an xml document before?
[06:33:39] <bongjovi> http://pastebin.com/44WSe3EQ this won't work for some reason
[06:34:25] <xec> bongjovi: try dataType: 'xml'
[06:34:46] <xec> if that's what you're expecting back
[06:38:55] <Daghdha> Heh. xec. It did go wrong because i deferred jquery :) but if i leave that out of the deferring it seems to work fine. I use jquery to bind the onload event
[06:40:05] <xec> Daghdha: aha, i thought you were referring to defer and async as concepts, but you were talking about attributes on the <script> element?
[06:41:14] <Daghdha> yes. I already removed it, but it seems to work ok as expected. It's not realy an issue in this site.  But good to know :)
[06:41:30] <xec> Daghdha: if you want async loading of libraries that your script depends on, you can use a lib like require.js
[06:42:34] <xec> Daghdha: you can also just include your scripts at the end of <body> so the browser will render the page and not wait for the script download to finish
[06:43:37] <xec> and by "your scripts" i mean jquery too ;)
[06:43:38] <Daghdha> xec: My understanding was that when using defer it will be concurrent
[06:45:15] <xec> defer basically means "dont do this immediately"
[06:45:17] <diverdude> Hello, what do you guys use for unit testing in javascript?
[06:46:02] <Daghdha> defer the execution yes, not the loading.
[06:46:48] <Daghdha> as where loading the script in html will stop page parsing untill the script is loaded. At least that 's what i read earlier and then continue.
[06:48:02] <xec> Daghdha: i'm not sure i understand the distinction
[06:50:42] <Daghdha> "The current state-of-the-art is to put scripts in the <head> tag and use the async or defer attributes. This allows your scripts to be downloaded asap without blocking your browser."
[06:51:02] <Daghdha> Loading big scripts block the rendering. Untill the script is loaded.
[06:52:16] <Cork> Daghdha: biggest problem with it is that it has kinda poor support in ie
[06:52:17] <bongjovi> xec, not expecting xml back, but when I var_dump the $_POST it returns an empty array
[06:52:29] <bongjovi> which I guess means the ajax post didn't work correctly
[06:52:32] <Cork> so you can get quite sever performance hits there
[06:52:48] <Daghdha> poor supprt?  It wil just work as it works now without the tags.
[06:53:04] <xec> bongjovi: im not too familiar with php, but you could inspect the http request itself and see if it looks like you expect?
[06:53:08] <Cork> Daghdha: exactly, meaning blocking rendering
[06:53:41] <Daghdha> Yes, so it's not realy a problem with the tags. It's aproblem with the old browsers.
[06:53:51] <Cork> Daghdha: classically referred to as performance cliffs
[06:54:19] <Cork> Daghdha: well rather problem with using an attribute before it is "safe" to use it
[06:54:47] <Daghdha> cork: How is it not safe?
[06:55:04] <Cork> Daghdha: uh, we just talked about the problem with it
[06:55:15] <bongjovi> xec, yeah, it seems to send the post data fine, inspecting it shows it as valid xml, but the response is always an empty array, no idea why
[06:55:25] <bongjovi> nobody can seem to find a problem with the code i pasted above
[06:56:20] <Cork> bongjovi: are you sure the problem is client side?
[06:56:23] <xec> bongjovi: i can't see anything wrong with the jquery paste either
[06:56:45] <Cork> the .php makes me suspect server side
[06:57:00] <Cork> as php normally doesn't handle xml formated post data very well
[06:57:13] <Daghdha> cork: I don't see that as a problem, you don't use the defer attribute then the old and new browsers will work fine. You use the attribute defer then new browser will work faster and old browser will work like before. Maybe i'm not getting it.
[06:57:17] <mogaj> How to set a text box value while closing dialog box?
[06:57:19] <Cork> (or anything none www-form encoded)
[06:58:04] <xec> Daghdha: "work as before" in this case means blocking, but you can make old and new browser both fine by including scripts at end of body
[06:58:08] <Cork> Daghdha: the point is, until you don't get the performance hit you move the tags to the end of body instead
[06:58:54] <Daghdha> You can do both.
[06:58:55] <Cork> its not like you can't get fast script loading without defer/async
[06:59:12] <Cork> Daghdha: it doens't give you anything if you don't have it in heaad
[06:59:14] <Cork> *head
[06:59:22] <Cork> and it will hit old browsers if you DO use it in head
[06:59:24] <Cork> so no you can't
[06:59:47] <Daghdha> Okay, so if i get it right defer is only usefull for script tags in the head?
[07:00:29] <xec> Daghdha: there is also one additional drawback to using defer, it does nothing for inline scripts, so if you have an inline script (i often do that if there's a short snippet only valid on a single page) it will execute before the deferred lib and fail
[07:00:40] <Cork> Daghdha: it is already deferred if you have it at the end of body
[07:00:51] <Daghdha> xec: Yes, inline scripts are DEAD when you use defer
[07:01:02] <Cork> uh
[07:01:48] <xec> also, the browser is smart enough to look ahead in the code and download scripts in parallel without using defer or async attributes
[07:11:02] <Chuk> If I'm making a DELETE HTTP request and I want to pass parameters, is it best practice to append the params to the url (script.php?param1=value)?
[07:11:41] <Cork> Chuk: DELETE verb is basically just a get call
[07:11:47] <Cork> so you do it the same way
[07:11:57] <jomofcw> Hello !
[07:12:08] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { type: 'delete', data: { param1: 'value1' } });
[07:12:10] <Chuk> Gotcha. Thanks, Cork
[07:12:17] <Chuk> Waith
[07:12:19] <Chuk> *Wait
[07:12:27] <Chuk> data:{} doesn't work
[07:12:31] <Cork> it does
[07:12:44] <Chuk> I must be missing something then
[07:13:00] <dylan9o4> Hey guys, I ran into something and it doesn't make sense to me. When I click this button, there is a result function which will in turn click another div that will show a html popup, but for some reason this only works on pc, not working on mobile for me. help would be so much appreciated! http://www.phenoral.com/dIncludes/freePhenModalDebug.html
[07:13:03] <Chuk> It works in v 1.11.1?
[07:13:06] <jomofcw> Is there a way to call the default action of an event after disable it with e.preventDefault() ? i.e. : I've got a form I post with AJAX, if I detect a given element in the AJAX response, I would like to let the form be POST with the "normal" way.
[07:15:31] <BillCriswell> jomofcw: if (something) e.preventDefault();
[07:15:44] <Cork> Chuk: hmm opps sorry
[07:15:58] <BillCriswell> Don't do: e.preventDefault(); if (something) tryToUndoPreventDefault()
[07:15:59] <Cork> Chuk: jquery actually handles delete data wrong
[07:16:15] <Chuk> Cork: That's what's been puzzling me
[07:16:33] <Cork> Chuk: rnoContent = /^(?:GET|HEAD)$/
[07:16:46] <Cork> so it only handles it for get and head
[07:16:50] <Cork> not delete
[07:17:10] <Chuk> So the only way to pass params is in the url then?
[07:17:22] <seutje> jomofcw: e.target[e.type]() ? :D
[07:17:42] <Cork> Chuk: yes
[07:17:57] <Cork> Chuk: i would do it as url + $.param() though
[07:17:58] <Chuk> Cork: Cool. Thanks for the confirmation.
[07:18:11] <jomofcw> seutje hey =). Hm... what do you mean :x ?
[07:18:26] <Chuk> Cork: Ah. Makes sense.
[07:18:32] <Chuk> $.param that is
[07:18:34] <jomofcw> can I wait for the AJAX to be load before preventing the default of the event ?
[07:18:52] <seutje> jomofcw: I'm just guessing, but you probably want to have a conditional around the e.preventDefault() and then just run submit() on the element when you want to do regular submit
[07:19:09] <Cork> Chuk: opps make that url + '?' + $.param()
[07:19:14] <bongjovi> Cork: Thanks, sorry for late reply. Everyone in #php seemed to think the JS was wrong, but I think it's probably the php too.
[07:19:27] <bongjovi> I'm guessing var_dump won't return an xml document, I'll ask more at #php
[07:19:29] <Chuk> Cork: Noted.
[07:19:52] <Cork> bongjovi: i've only ever sent none params data to php once
[07:19:56] <Cork> and it was a pure hell
[07:20:10] <BillCriswell> "2px groove threedface"... what?
[07:20:21] <bongjovi> none params data?
[07:20:34] <Cork> bongjovi: params == www-form-encoded
[07:20:43] <bongjovi> ah okay
[07:21:18] <seutje> jomofcw: like $('form').data('checked', false).on('submit', function(e) { var $target = $(e.target); if (!$target.data('checked')) { e.preventDefault; do stuff;  $target.data('checked', true); e.target.submit(); } });
[07:21:34] <jomofcw> seutje OK, I shall try if the event will wait for the AJAX response before doing the default action.
[07:22:04] <seutje> jomofcw: scope it so you still have access to the $target from within the ajax success handler
[07:22:16] <seutje> then you can .submit() from there
[07:24:20] <jomofcw> seutje yup that's what I'm trying to do. I try.
[07:25:14] <dylan9o4> Hi does anyone have a minute to look at my code?
[07:25:29] <teamcoltra> Hey guys, I am trying to loop through a class and I have figured that out and all but each time I loop, it always gives the results of the first item. http://jsfiddle.net/dSkD6/ as you could see it should say "hello red" "hello blue" "hello red" but instead each time it just says "hello red"
[07:25:59] <teamcoltra> The console log shows each is being looped separately
[07:26:25] <rjonesx> Would $(".fa-link").attr("data-toggle","tooltip"); effectively add the data-toggle attribute to all elements with the class "fa-link"
[07:28:54] <Cork> rjonesx: yes
[07:28:59] <teamcoltra> Whoops I posted a bad link http://jsfiddle.net/dSkD6/1/ that is my updated version which works but doesn't. I get why each are appended three times, but why is it redredred instead of redbluered
[07:29:30] <Cork> rjonesx: or specifcally it would build a list of all elements with the class, then loop them add add the attribute to each of them
[07:30:16] <NoiseEee> teamcoltra: http://jsfiddle.net/dSkD6/2/
[07:30:58] <rjonesx> very cool
[07:32:17] <teamcoltra> NoiseEee thanks, though what did the "find" do that makes it different?
[07:32:49] <NoiseEee> you have the obj, which is the <div>, you want to find the element with the 'background' class
[07:32:50] <teamcoltra> NoiseEee Oh the obj there too which makes it set to that particular loop :) That makes sense
[07:33:26] <dylan9o4> anyone know why a click() event would trigger on pc but not mobile?
[07:36:04] <rjonesx> Cork: Would it apply to elements with multiple classes? ie: if the class is class="fa fa-link" ?
[07:38:00] <seutje> dylan9o4: most mobile devices have a 200ms delay before it fires, but it should still fire
[07:38:12] <seutje> (unless something blocks it within those 200ms, I suppose)
[07:38:23] <mikroskeem> hey
[07:38:36] <mikroskeem> does jquery support parsing html get methods?
[07:38:57] <e-anima> anyobody knows a script that converts a multiselect list to "chained select7dependent select"
[07:39:35] <mikroskeem> like http://example.com/post-here.html?foo=bar can be accessed
[07:39:40] <dylan9o4> seutje: well in this case, i am using .click() to trigger another handler hooked to it, but for some reason it only seems to work on pc
[07:39:42] <jomofcw> And so, seutje, it's the problem I was thinking about : the default action fire before the success event of the AJAX proceed... so, whatever I put in the succees method of the AJAX load, it submit the form by default :/.
[07:40:12] <jomofcw> seutje perhaps I have to disable the asynchroneous thing ?
[07:40:52] <NoiseEee> dylan9o4: try trigger()
[07:41:23] <teamcoltra> NoiseEee When I put it into my real script (which has image and dependency requirements making it hard to fiddle) I get GET http://127.0.0.1/undefined 404 (Not Found)  my new line is "myImage.src = $(obj).find('.myImage').attr('src');" is there something inherently wrong with that?
[07:42:08] <jomofcw> seutje with async:false it works ! Is there any "problem" using async false ?
[07:42:33] <NoiseEee> teamcoltra: don't know but you should try throwing 'debugger' in the function and seeing whats what
[07:42:59] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ teamcoltra
[07:43:26] <seutje> jomofcw: lol, yeah
[07:44:11] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: i got all excited, almost peed my pants. but it didnt work. this is what i have to demo.. http://www.phenoral.com/dIncludes/modal2.html
[07:44:11] <seutje> jomofcw: erm can you paste some code, cause it seems you didn't entirely get what I was gunning at
[07:44:15] <teamcoltra> Thanks NoiseEee
[07:45:41] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: sorry, not that page, that demos the fact that it works on mobile if you physically click it. this page link demos .click or .trigger not working... http://www.phenoral.com/dIncludes/freePhenModalDebug.html
[07:50:45] <seutje> jomofcw: http://jsfiddle.net/v5TLe/
[07:51:15] <seutje> wait lol, don't even need the checker, my bad!
[07:51:19] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee or seutje i broke it down to 50 lines, i can tell you that the click handler function is in "modalEffects.js"
[07:52:09] <seutje> jomofcw: there http://jsfiddle.net/v5TLe/2/
[07:52:17] <seutje> dylan9o4: sorry, I really gotta run now
[07:52:36] <dylan9o4> aw, k
[07:54:43] <NoiseEee> dylan9o4: jquery isnt included on that page
[07:55:12] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: its on line 4
[07:55:45] <NoiseEee> dylan9o4: not on http://www.phenoral.com/dIncludes/modal2.html
[07:57:30] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: i see, i actually didn't need it for that example, since that page was demonstrating that it works with a physical click, the event handler is in modalEffects.js, which uses the js querySelector
[07:57:39] <tandroid> anyone know of a live pastebin that lets me use jquery 1.4?
[07:57:58] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: http://www.phenoral.com/dIncludes/freePhenModalDebug.html
[07:58:22] <tandroid> Oh I guess I can include a custom library… nevermind
[07:59:07] <NoiseEee> dylan9o4: the problem there as defined in your console is trying to load scripts not obeying same origin policy
[08:00:03] <NoiseEee> one sec
[08:00:09] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: i saw, but it was for an .htc file, and I didn't think it would obstruct the integrity of the code, considering it still works on pc
[08:00:29] <dylan9o4> k
[08:01:11] <NoiseEee> dylan9o4: jQuery('button').on('click',function(){alert('clicked')});  jQuery('button').first().click(); works fine in console
[08:01:19] <NoiseEee> ahh bugger i said use trigger
[08:01:46] <NoiseEee> jQuery('button').on('click',function(){alert('clicked')});  jQuery('button').first().trigger('click'); @ dylan9o4
[08:02:08] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: i guess it's just not triggering the handler that is in modalEffects.js for some reason
[08:03:51] <NoiseEee> weird
[08:04:43] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: yes ive been pulling my hair for hours
[08:05:18] <NoiseEee> are you waiting until the lib is loaded before you trigger
[08:05:26] <NoiseEee> ie: from console it doesn't work?
[08:06:31] <beasty> afternoonish
[08:08:32] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: yes because it is only triggered when i click that button, so i can only assume it has loaded by then lol. and again only on mobile.
[08:10:37] <tandroid> Anyone have any ideas on how to get this to work in jquery 4.4? http://jsfiddle.net/nSyLJ/
[08:10:39] <NoiseEee> you can try triggering touchstart perhaps
[08:10:48] <NoiseEee> both click and touchstart
[08:10:55] <tandroid> The -=10 seems to be the issue
[08:12:25] <tandroid> So I figured I could do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/nSyLJ/1/
[08:12:29] <tandroid> but that doesn't work either.
[08:13:22] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: no such luck with jQuery('.md-trigger').trigger( "click" ).trigger("touchstart");
[08:16:29] <NoiseEee> dylan9o4:  jQuery('.md-trigger').first().trigger( "click" ) or "touchstart", and if that works, for multiples i guess try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11850625/jquery-trigger-multiple-events
[08:17:34] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: oh okay. there's only one trigger, that's why i didn't say .first()
[08:18:30] <tandroid> Ah, left was returning a pixel value so I just needed to use parseInt() if anyone was curious.
[08:19:52] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: ugh touchstart is a no-go. i really dont get it. ill move the code to jsbin so you can edit if you so please..
[08:20:10] <bberry> if i want to bind an argument on to a callback function but i want to preserve the 'this' variable inside the callback function, how do i call the .bind?
[08:20:29] <bberry> so i have like $("#foo").on('click', myFunction.bind(???, 'foo'));
[08:20:57] <kegster> if i have a regular UL/LI nav, how can i get each item to fit across horizontally or whichever? basically i want them going from end to end, spaced nicely
[08:21:03] <kegster> but not using a full nav framework or something
[08:21:33] <dylan9o4> NoiseEee: http://jsbin.com/fakic/2/edit
[08:21:50] <NoiseEee> dylan9o4: i'd just probably try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18059860/manually-trigger-touch-event or maybe peek at http://a-fung.github.io/jQueryTouch/touch.html  i'm off to work
[08:22:08] <thebope> Hey guys
[08:22:32] <thebope> When I'm in a .each loop, if I do a selector, does it automatically look within that element only?
[08:23:40] <thebope> Oh I could do a $(this).find I suppose
[08:29:01] <BillCriswell> thebope: You would have to use .find() on the element.
[08:30:11] <thebope> yea $(this).find is how I worked it out
[08:30:40] <thebope> I ended up answering myself up there haha
[08:31:23] <bberry> what i ended up doing (idk if this is the right way or not) is $("#foo").on('click', myFxn.bind($("#foo"), 'foo'));
[08:37:32] <thebope> You're binding a function every click?
[08:38:44] <bberry> lol no
[08:41:59] <NoiseEee> bberry: $('#foo').on('click',$.proxy(function(ev) { //some function}),this)) is likely what you're after
[08:42:12] <NoiseEee> but i dunno your case
[08:42:23] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.proxy/
[08:42:39] <iamntz> bberry, http://api.jquery.com/on/#passing-data doesn't help?
[08:45:43] <bberry> eh i just solved it another way. i was going to use the addition argument from the .bind as a way to determine what was clicked. but i can just use e.target to figure that out
[08:48:30] <onethfour> is it possible to hook an onfocus onto an iframe?
[09:24:26] <yocapybara> Just had a weird situation where I find a sortable list doesn't respond to drags in safari, but does in chrome.  Only then I restart safari and it then responds.  Anyone else got this behaviour anytime?
[09:25:09] <eugenmayer> i have a programatic selector. Can i somehow test if the selector is valid (syntax wise). IE11 throws an issue otherwise
[09:25:19] <eugenmayer> do i need to use a try / ctch block?
[09:25:20] <duch_kazatel> eugenmayer mind clarifying?
[09:25:30] <duch_kazatel> jqueyr selectors shouldn't throw errors.
[09:25:33] <duch_kazatel> *jquery
[09:25:47] <BillCriswell> yocapybara: I hate when restarting fixes things in a browser.
[09:26:22] <eugenmayer> they do in IE11 "wrong syntax" if you use a broken selector like '#'
[09:26:23] <Cork> eugenmayer: you don't need to do anything, as long as the syntax is valid
[09:26:31] <yocapybara> BillCriswell: me too, makes no sense and the last thing I was expecting.  I thought it was just plain busted until I tried it in chrome
[09:26:39] <eugenmayer> the syntax might _not_ be valid and thats what i want to test for
[09:26:56] <duch_kazatel> eugenmayer you should catch before you hit that selector, then./
[09:27:54] <BillCriswell> yocapybara: My biggest pet peeve is it's usually impossible to reproduce.
[09:28:20] <BillCriswell> Just have to hope it works for someone on the other end haha
[09:29:11] <jphase> afternoon gentlemen/ladies :)
[09:29:16] <duch_kazatel> gooood morning.
[09:29:27] <yocapybara> BillCriswell: yup, for real.  Unless I browse all the other sites I browsed since I opened safari, at the same time of the day, under the same memory/CPU conditions, I'm out of luck.  Mind you I thought it was broken, and it wasn't, so I've got that going for me
[09:29:49] <BillCriswell> yocapybara: I just like to think it's devtools making things a little wonky in the long run and a normal user won't have an issue.
[09:30:17] <onethfour> Is there anyway to put an onfocus on an iframe? I'm trying it but it's not working
[09:30:32] <yocapybara> BillCriswell: that's a good possibility, hadn't thought of that.  :) hope it is that!
[09:30:43] <NoiseEee> onethfour: what does that mean exactly
[09:30:45] <Cork> onethfour: it if, but yoy most likely ism't interested in that
[09:31:09] <Cork> onethfour: cause that is when the iframe has focus, and not somethign in the page inside it
[09:31:33] <onethfour> I'm using jhtmlarea which converts a textarea to an editable control using an iframe, but I need an onfocus event but it's not working
[09:31:35] <BillCriswell> yocapybara: Another thing I worry about is crappy Chrome extensions. There was someone in here not too long ago who had a chrome extension that was including jQuery and conflicting with a site they were working on.
[09:32:01] <onethfour> how do I detect when something inside the iframe has focus?
[09:32:03] <Cork> onethfour: you need to check focus on the document inside the iframe
[09:32:31] <onethfour> so like $(#myiframe document)
[09:32:33] <yocapybara> BillCriswell: eeeew that might be it, I've got evernote helper and 1password and a couple of other things in safari, and in the devtools it looks like they attach crap to allsorts
[09:32:59] <yocapybara> maybe not directly similar (conflicting jquery) but -something- conflicting
[09:33:09] <yocapybara> that has a ring of truth to the way it sounds
[09:33:40] <Cork> onethfour: $('#iframe').contents().on('focus' ...)
[09:33:54] <onethfour> oh cool thanks let me try that
[09:35:42] <onethfour> not working
[09:36:04] <NoiseEee> what does putting a document in focus mean, onethfour?
[09:36:22] <onethfour> $('#area').htmlarea('getIframe').contents().focus(function(){ console.log('inside iframe div'); });
[09:37:12] <onethfour> the control i believe has contenteditable
[09:37:21] <onethfour> so when you click inside it
[09:37:26] <onethfour> it blinks a cursor
[09:37:29] <onethfour> that would be on focus
[09:37:42] <freebird2> hy, I've this small situation, when you enter this page: http://tabacariabueno.com.br/diego/teste.html   and scroll down, you will see a menu, if you mouse over the last menu item, a submenu will show up, the problem is that it's showing under the div I want, z-index doesn't work at all, any help is appreciated, tks
[09:39:49] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 why is your height 0px on the header?
[09:40:06] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, hm, not sure man, I'll check, is that a problem ?
[09:40:17] <onethfour> is jsfiddle down?
[09:40:33] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 that's part of your problem, yeah.
[09:40:43] <duch_kazatel> yo're constraining things and then setting overflow: hidden;
[09:42:24] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, the header height, is set to auto, this was done by some template
[09:42:50] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 check the rendered styles after you scroll down.
[09:43:04] <duch_kazatel> also the header is set to overflow: hidden;
[09:43:13] <duch_kazatel> the whole header needs to be rebuilt.
[09:43:48] <freebird2> removing the overflow hidden changed nothing
[09:44:08] <duch_kazatel> that's one of many things you'll need to change.
[09:45:22] <duch_kazatel> you need to remove the 0px height on #header
[09:45:28] <duch_kazatel> the inline declaration.
[09:45:32] <duch_kazatel> remove overflow: hidden;
[09:45:34] <freebird2> set to what ?
[09:45:45] <duch_kazatel> remove it.
[09:46:19] <duch_kazatel> there's an extra div with background: #000; height: 200px; after the nav - that should be display: none; after the user scrolls down.
[09:48:16] <duch_kazatel> there's a min-height on #header that's breaking things as well.
[09:49:25] <duch_kazatel> you have a ton of redundant styles all over the place that's breaking your layout basically.
[09:49:42] <freebird2> I see
[09:50:18] <freebird2> because theres a lot more in the real page, this a small page, so I could put the problem apart
[09:50:26] <freebird2> I'll upload the chnages
[09:50:33] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/ZWXcKSx.png - I was able to get this pretty easily.
[09:50:51] <duch_kazatel> do what i said above.
[09:51:40] <onethfour> So it turns out firing the onfocus or onblur on an iframe isn't really possible, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5456239/detecting-when-an-iframe-gets-or-loses-focus , is this correct?
[09:51:52] <freebird2> cooll
[09:52:17] <duch_kazatel> onethfour why are you trying to focus on an iframe?
[09:52:29] <onethfour> i'm trying to detect when it gets focus
[09:52:33] <duch_kazatel> okay - whyfor?
[09:52:34] <freebird2> when I add the display , things stop showing
[09:53:04] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 you need to modify the way the header styles are getting applied.
[09:53:08] <duch_kazatel> your header is what's breaking things.
[09:53:20] <onethfour> becaus ethe iframe is editable converted from a textarea
[09:53:26] <freebird2> I added the #header to the file,
[09:53:31] <freebird2> and did the changes
[09:53:53] <duch_kazatel> okay, update the link and resend then.
[09:54:17] <duch_kazatel> i was able to play around with css in browser and it worked fine, so i'm not sure what you're doing differently.
[09:55:03] <freebird2> http://tabacariabueno.com.br/diego/teste.html
[09:55:05] <freebird2> duch_kazatel,
[09:55:30] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 are you using your developer tools at all?
[09:55:46] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, yes, it's still reading from the css right ?
[09:55:53] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:57:25] <duch_kazatel> again, when you scroll down, you want to remove the min-height: on #header.  or change that to 50px instead.
[09:57:30] <freebird2> lol,
[09:57:32] <freebird2> worked
[09:57:33] <freebird2> man
[09:57:44] <freebird2> I copyed the css
[09:57:56] <freebird2> changed the header as you said
[09:58:01] <freebird2> worked, tks again duch_kazatel
[09:58:19] <duch_kazatel> and finally, remove the overflow: hidden; on #header
[10:05:24] <BillCriswell> Chrome is being a dick today.
[10:06:45] <Jattenalle> today?
[10:07:03] <BillCriswell> Yes... it was cool yesterday, today it's being weird.
[10:07:12] <Jattenalle> what a dick
[10:07:26] <Jattenalle> did you try turning it off and on again?
[10:07:28] <BillCriswell> I wish I could use a Mac at work.
[10:07:32] <NoiseEee> much like the weather
[10:07:33] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Haha I just restarted it.
[10:07:37] * Jattenalle gasps loudly
[10:07:38] <Jattenalle> a mac!?
[10:07:40] <Jattenalle> to do work!?
[10:07:44] <Jattenalle> are you mad!
[10:08:04] <BillCriswell> Haha. I am a mac guy.
[10:09:31] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell most of our dev team chooses mac.
[10:10:13] <BillCriswell> I hate to say shit like this but.. it just  (95% of the time) works.
[10:10:31] <duch_kazatel> i was a mac fanatic in the pre-OSX days.
[10:11:09] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, yeah, mac's are expensive, so any company/person that use them also treat them with the respect a PC deserves
[10:11:15] <Jattenalle> while windows PCs are cheap
[10:11:20] <Jattenalle> so people smoke on them and ash into the keyboard
[10:11:26] <Jattenalle> and let their pet rat play inside the case
[10:11:33] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle unless you're at my company ;)
[10:11:35] <BillCriswell> I've been using a mac since like... 2000?
[10:11:42] <duch_kazatel> we do all laptops here
[10:11:49] <duch_kazatel> well, for dev/admin.
[10:11:58] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, do you let your pet rats play on the laptops?
[10:12:03] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:12:12] <Jattenalle> good call
[10:12:12] <duch_kazatel> we have really nice laptops, too.
[10:12:31] <Jattenalle> the only gripe i have with mac, to be honest, is the price
[10:12:38] <Jattenalle> and if people dont mind it, meh, i dont care
[10:12:40] <Jattenalle> it's just not for me
[10:12:53] <BillCriswell> I don't mind the price really.
[10:13:03] <BillCriswell> I get a lot of use out of it and it lasts a while.
[10:13:28] <duch_kazatel> i'll admit the laptops are really well built.
[10:13:41] <duch_kazatel> the hardware is great.  the software is what i'm not a fan of.
[10:13:43] <BillCriswell> $1,000 for something I'll use at least 8 hours a day for 3+ years.
[10:13:49] <Jattenalle> for the price they better be
[10:15:04] <BillCriswell> What does a good PC cost?
[10:15:16] <duch_kazatel> depends on what all you're buying.
[10:15:24] <kedgen> Does anyone know of a way to check if the user is actually using a phone versus whether they have just resized their browser window to be the size of a phone?
[10:15:31] <duch_kazatel> i did a new mobo/ram/cpu/cooler setup for around 600 not that long ago.
[10:15:32] <Jattenalle> a $1000 mac is about half as powerful as a PC for the same price
[10:15:38] <Jattenalle> you can get a very decent PC for $500
[10:15:47] <kedgen> Or put better: if their device is actually a certain size as opposed to the browser window being a certain size
[10:15:49] <Jattenalle> which would still blow any mac out of the water performance wise
[10:16:00] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle that's becoming less and less true.
[10:16:01] <Jattenalle> however, that's irrelevant if you dont play games or do any heavy work on it
[10:16:04] <Jattenalle> ie: video editing/rendering
[10:16:16] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, yeah, it used to be the PC was 4x as fast ;)
[10:16:17] <duch_kazatel> the latest mac pros disprove that.
[10:16:23] <duch_kazatel> now it's all the same hardware.
[10:16:38] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:16:39] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: My 3 year old mac feels quicker than a brand new PC out of the box. Not sure if it's just windows that's bad or what.
[10:16:40] <Jattenalle> but it costs more
[10:16:43] <Jattenalle> is what i was saying
[10:17:01] <duch_kazatel> check out the teardown on cost for the recent mac pros.  you'd be surprised.
[10:17:05] <silverdust> I have this http://jsfiddle.net/4dEeN/3/ and my selectors don't pick the templates in the <template> even when they are active
[10:17:18] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, sounds like you've seen shitty PC :P
[10:17:37] <Jattenalle> obviously, if you buy a pre-assembled, pre-installed BrandNamePC, it'll be bloated with shit
[10:18:01] <silverdust> Like <template><div id="foo"></div></template> and $('#foo') doesn't pick
[10:18:17] <Jattenalle> anyhow, as i said, i dont mind people who get mac's, if it works for them, good for them
[10:18:24] <Jattenalle> i do mind the crazy evangelists though...
[10:18:27] <Jattenalle> :P
[10:18:42] <BillCriswell> Haha I totally understand.
[10:18:48] <BillCriswell> Different strokes for different folks.
[10:19:18] <jphase> my strokes are identical to everyone elses, I'm void of all opinion
[10:19:21] <jphase> :D
[10:19:42] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[10:19:54] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: I don't even know where to go to get the specs in windows. =(
[10:20:05] <BillCriswell> I'm in System Information but I must be missing something.
[10:20:13] <Jattenalle> haha
[10:20:29] <BillCriswell> On OSX I click "Apple Icon > About This Mac"
[10:20:55] <Jattenalle> dxdiag gives you all the info you need, and more :)
[10:21:02] <Jattenalle> start, run, "dxdiag"
[10:22:29] <BillCriswell> 6GB of ram, 2.27GHz (4cpus)
[10:23:16] <BillCriswell> Intel Xeon CPU... is that older or newer than a Core 2 Duo?
[10:23:51] <BillCriswell> My Macbook Pro feels a lot quicker than this windows machine but it seems like the windows machine should be a lot faster.
[10:26:47] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, Xeon is Intel's "Server" CPU
[10:27:16] <BillCriswell> I feel like this machine should be running laps around my pro but it doesn't feel it haha
[10:27:17] <Jattenalle> if that's what you have for your workstation no wonder it runs weirdly.. probably has ECC RAM as well, not really optimized for desktop work
[10:27:24] <Jattenalle> more so for server stuff
[10:27:47] <BillCriswell> Ah, got ya.
[10:27:50] <Jattenalle> well it also depends on what programs you're using and how well made they are
[10:29:04] <BillCriswell> I barely use anything besides Chrome, Sublime Text and WinSCP
[10:31:04] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, yeah it should be blazing fast for that
[10:31:16] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, sounds like your IT guy did something :P
[10:32:39] <BillCriswell> It also probably has something to do with Windows XP haha
[10:34:03] <Jattenalle> wait, that machine is running windows xp? :/
[10:34:13] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:34:22] <BillCriswell> Chrome stopped being lame. Wonder what the issue was.
[10:34:41] <BillCriswell> It wouldn't let me drag tabs off or even move my external dev tools window.
[10:34:58] <Jattenalle> silly
[10:35:04] <Jattenalle> that poor machine though
[10:35:09] <Jattenalle> what has your IT tech done to it!
[10:36:49] <BillCriswell> Sabotaging me!
[11:04:09] <onethfour> anyone have any ideas for detecting an onfocus inside an iframe?
[11:04:43] <drej> onethfour you have to pass it back up from the child document to the parent
[11:04:47] <drej> no way to do it from the parent as far as i know
[11:04:48] <CloudyOne> ^
[11:05:01] <onethfour> the parent is creating the child iframe
[11:05:07] <CloudyOne> technically you can detect url changes
[11:05:18] <CloudyOne> so if the child had an onfocus that was changing the url
[11:05:34] <CloudyOne> then you could subscribe to the onchange from that iframe and validate against the url
[11:05:44] <onethfour> i just need the onfocus and onblur
[11:06:09] <CloudyOne> i need an onthefirstgimmemoney
[11:06:34] <onethfour> not sure what yo umean
[11:07:31] <drej> onethfour the iframe does what?
[11:07:34] <drej> load a document, right
[11:07:46] <drej> that document, has to have javascript that bubbles that focus event back up to the parent document
[11:07:48] <onethfour> the iframe actually acts with contenteditable
[11:08:05] <onethfour> it is for jHtmlArea
[11:08:29] <drej> $5 says jhtmlarea has hooks for you to track events from within their sandboxed thing.
[11:10:15] <execi> Using jquery 1.11.1, in an ajax call, success should still work, right?
[11:10:37] <duch_kazatel> execi it should, but you should prefer using .don() instead.
[11:10:50] <duch_kazatel> *done
[11:11:16] <execi> I have an ajax call to a php script, which returns json. For some reason my ajax call isn't entering the success block
[11:11:27] <duch_kazatel> any errors in the console?
[11:11:30] <execi> none
[11:11:37] <duch_kazatel> and the net panel?
[11:11:53] <execi> one second
[11:12:49] <execi> 200 OK
[11:12:55] <onethfour> drej there arent any hooks
[11:13:09] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ execi
[11:13:09] <b-ot> execi: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:13:46] <onethfour> i'm looking at their source code
[11:14:07] <onethfour> trying to figure out where I would have to put an onfocus and onblur drej
[11:14:15] <BillCriswell> "technology solutions" lol
[11:14:20] <drej> why in gods name are you looking at their source code
[11:14:26] <drej> and not the documentation
[11:14:41] <onethfour> docs arent that plentiful
[11:14:48] <onethfour> let me try their docs
[11:14:50] <drej> then use a different editor
[11:15:02] <onethfour> this one is light weight
[11:15:09] <drej> i mean, the point is, you cannot capture an event from an iframe unless you pass it back up from the child page
[11:15:13] <drej> that's it. period
[11:15:22] <execi> http://jsfiddle.net/J4VM5/ duch_kazatel . I removed the contents of the success block because they are irrelevant
[11:15:30] <onethfour> so do i add an onfocus inside the irame while it is  getting created?
[11:15:34] <drej> what the specific implementation is of this plugin, maybe ask them ?
[11:16:03] <duch_kazatel> execi and you do not hit this new alert instead?
[11:16:22] <onethfour> this.editor = this.iframe[0].contentWindow.document;
[11:16:30] <onethfour> that is the implementation
[11:16:33] <execi> I put the alert there in order to see whether it actually hits the block. It doesn't
[11:17:08] <execi> the php's 200 so i have no idea
[11:17:40] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see it in action then, sorry!
[11:19:26] <Cork> execi: (didn't see the start of the question) having problem with ajax call?
[11:19:41] <execi> yeah, trying something out
[11:19:59] <Cork> have you tried binding an .fail() handler (or errors:)
[11:20:11] <Cork> might be jquery fails to parse the data sent back
[11:21:58] <execi> apparently that's a problem, Cork
[11:22:37] <execi> Don't know why it fails, because the php returns 200
[11:22:50] <duch_kazatel> execi because the json isn't valid.
[11:23:10] <Cork> execi: firstly is your php script setting header application/json ?
[11:23:13] <duch_kazatel> jquery couldn't parse it for whatever reason.
[11:23:33] <execi> Cork: actually it isn't, I'll change that
[11:23:45] <Cork> execi: ok, so jquery will take it as text
[11:24:06] <execi> I have dataType specified in the call, thought that solves it
[11:24:11] <Cork> no
[11:24:16] <execi> alrightey
[11:24:24] <Cork> dataType sets what the browser asks the server for
[11:24:29] <Cork> the accepts: header
[11:24:43] <Cork> what the server sets as content-type still is what the server sends
[11:25:08] <Cork> a good example is where you request json and the server responds with a generic text/html error page
[11:25:42] <Cork> or an html login page
[11:26:28] <execi> Hmm thanks. Now I actually know what's wrong with this
[11:26:57] <execi> Heh. it was plain obvious. Don't think it's the header, but it's something being sent before that
[11:27:11] <Cork> execi: also the fail callback has a status argument
[11:27:22] <Cork> it contains the jquery.ajax reason if it fails there
[11:27:53] <Cork> and ya, the header isn't causing the call to fail
[11:28:03] <Cork> but it will prevent you from getting json in the success callback
[11:35:40] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/Anmh9/ <--- when you hover over the gold question mark in the preview, the text underneath should be displayed... however in my case, it is displaying for all instances and not just the section it is in. Can someone take a look at my loop and help me figure out what's going on here?
[11:35:59] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky i showed you how yesterday
[11:36:15] <duch_kazatel> you're taking 2 steps back.
[11:36:15] <bigLanky> yeah but its changed since then... used a different method
[11:36:25] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[11:36:29] <duch_kazatel> you're using the same method.
[11:37:11] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Anmh9/1/
[11:37:17] <duch_kazatel> don't bind inside of an .each()
[11:37:25] <bigLanky> ah
[11:37:29] <bigLanky> thank you very much duch_kazatel
[11:47:31] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: in this code http://jsfiddle.net/4dEeN/3/ , isn't selecting elements that came from <template>
[11:47:37] <silverdust> why is that?
[11:47:43] <wunz> how would i make the dropbox insert under the text? http://jsfiddle.net/d5G5Z/2/
[11:50:57] <Cork> silverdust: jquery selectors generates a snapshot in time
[11:51:23] <Cork> silverdust: so they will only contain a list of elements that existed when the selector ran
[11:52:18] <silverdust> Cork: Is there a solution to this. Will it be better if I just use getElementById() ?
[11:53:13] <Cork> wunz: good enough http://jsfiddle.net/d5G5Z/3/ ?
[11:53:29] <Cork> silverdust: getElementById does the same ting
[11:53:35] <silverdust> or to replace <template> with a display:none div
[11:53:48] <Cork> specifically $('#<id>') === $(document.getElementById('id'))
[11:54:09] <Cork> silverdust: what specific selector isn't working for you in the code?
[11:54:23] <wunz> Cork: how did that css solve it? but it should be below the images too
[11:54:31] <wunz> i think the image is supposed to be next to the text
[11:54:35] <wunz> then the dropdown shows under that
[11:54:40] <silverdust> #compform
[11:55:12] <silverdust> It handles the compform outside templates well but doesn't handle the one coming from templates
[11:55:17] <Cork> silverdust: change  $('#staffForm').on('submit' to  $(document).on('submit', '#staffForm'
[11:55:37] <silverdust> ok
[11:55:45] <Cork> that makes the event handler delegated
[11:56:02] <Cork> and it binds in on document and listens as #staffForm bubbles up the tree instead
[11:56:16] <Cork> so even if the element doesn't exist when you bind the event, it will still catch it
[11:56:45] <silverdust> same with #compform right
[11:57:05] <Cork> silverdust: same will all event handlers where the element doesn't exist when you add the handler
[11:57:23] <Cork> wunz: btw, style request, please use lowercase element names in the html
[11:57:28] <Cork> becomes easier to read
[11:57:54] <Cork> wunz: also you have a huge amount of invalid attributes
[11:58:01] <Cork> you should prefix those with data-
[11:58:06] <wunz> Cork: i would but its not my code, its generated by a CMS
[11:58:14] <Cork> ouch
[11:58:23] <Cork> a lousy cms then
[11:58:31] <wunz> welcome to microsoft ;p
[11:58:33] <wunz> SharePoint
[11:59:11] <Cork> wunz: ok, anyway
[11:59:21] <Cork> what exactly are you trying to do?
[11:59:57] <wunz> make the dropdown come after the text/images
[12:00:05] <silverdust> Now that that's done, it doesn't fix the problem. Do you think replacing <template> to a display:none <div> will fix the issue?
[12:00:05] <wunz> basically it needs a <br>
[12:00:32] <silverdust> since it'll be available in the code but it wouldn't just display on the page
[12:01:21] <drej> nothing _needs_ a <br>
[12:01:31] <Cork> silverdust: it shouldn't matter as long as you insert the text from <template> in the form when you want to use it
[12:01:50] <Cork> wunz: ugg that html makes my eyes bleed...
[12:02:21] <Cork> but ok so you basically want to change <select><br><a> to <a><br><select>
[12:03:31] <wunz> Cork: correcto
[12:03:46] <silverdust> you mean now that I have it as $(document).on(...); ?
[12:03:47] <wunz> lol, yes that html does make my eyes go nuts as well
[12:04:14] <Cork> wunz: http://jsfiddle.net/d5G5Z/4/
[12:04:43] <Cork> silverdust: yes when you have bound it to $(document) it listens for a form with that id
[12:05:01] <silverdust> ok thanks! 'll try it again
[12:05:02] <Cork> it doesn't bind it to a form with that id
[12:05:04] <Cork> so it should work
[12:05:21] <wunz> ahhh thats what i was looking for
[12:05:24] <wunz> thanks Cork !
[12:05:30] <Cork> wunz: np
[12:07:52] <silverdust> yea it works! Thanks Cork
[12:15:03] <silverdust> Cork: I have a case where I want to set a display: block on an element and also put data in its InnerHTML
[12:15:16] <silverdust> I'm writing this twice
[12:15:28] <silverdust> Is there a way to have it in a closure and have it once
[12:16:29] <silverdust> $('.class').html(Item,function(){$(this).css('display','block'); })
[12:16:35] <silverdust> Is that a valid code?
[12:16:42] <fission6> race condition question for yout channel http://dpaste.com/32C5P17
[12:18:32] <BulleTime> hi, anyone knows masonry or hopefully packery jquery pluigins?
[12:19:47] <BulleTime> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rHuyv  << its an example demonstrating the issue
[12:19:47] <silverdust> The world knows masonry
[12:20:16] <BulleTime> when the container goes below 600px the gap aint filled correctly
[12:20:34] <BulleTime> its with all the plugins and i tried all possible solutions
[12:21:15] <BulleTime> it should be 1 - 3 - 2 - 4 on my site
[12:21:43] <BulleTime> but it seems to hold the position of the divs
[12:27:17] <Cork> silverdust: so you want to set display on the .class?
[12:27:45] <Cork> silverdust: btw normally it is simpler to just use .show() instead of .css('display'...)
[12:28:05] <Cork> silverdust: if yes then do $('.class').show().html(Item);
[12:28:23] <Cork> or $('.class').html(Item).show() if you prefer that
[12:31:00] <Cork> fission6: only if the first one is inserted by a script that runs after the second
[12:31:08] <Cork> fission6: or if you move the orders
[12:32:21] <Fishy> How can i change the width of a jquery mobile drop down? When i set the width the drop down goes over the label.
[12:33:59] <fission6> Cork: this is the exact situation, http://dpaste.com/123PZ4G i dont see how some.js can work and use _Data if its defined below
[12:35:37] <Cork> fission6: the script writes the script tag with document.write
[12:35:49] <Cork> so it is fetched and executed AFTER the current script
[12:36:35] <Cork> document.write is horrible and shouldn't be used though
[12:39:12] <fission6> Cork: gotcha
[12:42:24] <fission6> thanks Cork
[12:43:13] <Cork> np
[12:43:14] <jkymmel> hey, I have a bit of a problem with my code: https://gist.github.com/jkymmel/562a8a41526d5439d4a3 It is supposed to be like that, It displayes 3 "tasks" but everything but the title is hidden (collapsed), so, if you click on the title, the title should change a class and the class hidden will be changed to open. But... it doesn't work...
[12:44:10] <Cork> jkarsrud: you bind the handler before the elements exist
[12:44:22] <jkarsrud> Cork: good to know :)
[12:44:29] <jkarsrud> I think that was for jkymmel
[12:44:34] <jkarsrud> ;)
[12:44:54] <jkymmel> wait what :D
[12:48:28] <Cork> jkarsrud: lol sorry
[12:48:39] <Cork> jkymmel: yes that was for you
[12:48:41] <bigLanky> duch_kazatel you still around?
[12:49:53] <jkymmel> can you explain like im five? im new to javascript and coming from different languages it looks like total nonsense to me :D
[12:50:47] <duch_kazatel> i am now yeah
[12:50:49] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/6LY9q/ <--- having some issues with my loop again... the same value is getting reused but each has a unique value
[12:52:35] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky what are you trying to do here?
[12:52:48] <Cork> jkymmel: line 5 depends on line 38 and down
[12:53:00] <bigLanky> so in the results, all of my descriptions (under the question marks) reads "Please describe what..."
[12:53:12] <bigLanky> but it should be pulling the value for that input based on .description
[12:53:25] <bigLanky> i removed the qtip code as that is now working
[12:53:33] <jkymmel> so I should just move it to the end of the "task" elements?
[12:53:34] <bigLanky> but its using the same .description value for all
[12:54:45] <Cork> jkymmel: at least, yes
[12:54:59] <Cork> jkymmel: preferably you should have it at the end of <body>
[12:55:20] <jkymmel> ok, gonna try it
[12:55:35] <Cork> jkymmel: also in the long run, you should move your js out of the html
[12:55:44] <Cork> and hold it in a separate js file
[12:56:05] <jkymmel> yeah, im gonna do that
[12:56:21] <jkymmel> havnt bothered to do it for a few lines tho
[12:56:32] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky ...
[12:56:35] <duch_kazatel> do you not see it?
[12:56:39] <Cork> and as a sidenote an alternative solution is to use the $(function() {}) wrapper around your code
[12:56:55] <bigLanky> no i dont
[12:56:56] <Cork> that is a short hand for $(document).ready
[12:57:11] <Cork> and it listens for an event from the browser when the dom is parsed and ready
[12:57:15] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky $('.tiptext .description') -> this selects all .description inside of all .tiptext
[12:57:23] <Cork> but you should basically have the code in <head> if you use it
[12:57:47] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky that selector doesn't care about the current context.
[12:58:10] <bigLanky> so remove .tiptext ?
[12:58:16] <bigLanky> or do i need to get more specific with it
[12:58:52] <fullhdpixel> How to check which element is the highest on the page out of a certain list of elements?
[12:59:01] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky it's like everything else - you need to relate it back to the current element.
[12:59:07] <duch_kazatel> "highest"?
[12:59:16] <duch_kazatel> like, vertically?
[12:59:19] <fullhdpixel> Yes
[13:00:05] <fullhdpixel> I want to add styles to a navbar depending on which content is visible
[13:00:35] <duch_kazatel> there are plugins that will do that for you.
[13:00:46] <duch_kazatel> "highest" is the wrong way to do it, either wya.
[13:00:48] <duch_kazatel> *way
[13:00:49] <fullhdpixel> okay, can you give me a name
[13:00:55] <duch_kazatel> jquery-scrollspy is one.
[13:01:00] <fullhdpixel> awesome thanks
[13:01:16] <duch_kazatel> the idea is pretty simple - you want to bind a listener on scroll and check each content area to see which is current visible.
[13:01:32] <duch_kazatel> *currently
[13:01:40] <bigLanky> duch_kazatel: shouldnt i already be in the current element based on the loop?
[13:01:58] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky that selector doesn't have context.  it's like if you were to run it anywhere else.
[13:02:14] <duch_kazatel> you have to relate it back to $(this).
[13:02:19] <bigLanky> ah ok
[13:04:14] <bigLanky> no luck :(
[13:04:28] <duch_kazatel> show me what you have.
[13:05:10] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/6LY9q/1/
[13:05:15] <bigLanky> just trying some things
[13:05:35] <duch_kazatel> sec
[13:05:54] <duch_kazatel> that selector won't work btw.
[13:06:17] <bigLanky> why not
[13:07:13] <duch_kazatel> .siblings() looks for a sibling that matches that selector.
[13:07:51] <bigLanky> ah that makes sense
[13:09:48] <bigLanky> is there an issue with using .description twice?
[13:10:05] <duch_kazatel> you're thinking too hard.
[13:10:25] <duch_kazatel> and doing things very strangely.
[13:10:40] <bigLanky> yeah... im still relatively new to jquery
[13:11:59] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6LY9q/2/
[13:12:02] <duch_kazatel> you can do this insteead.
[13:12:44] <duch_kazatel> build the thing you want to use, then put it in.  don't partially do it and then put it in, only to edit it again.
[13:13:09] <bigLanky> yeah... i had to change the structure but it should be good now
[13:13:15] <bigLanky> what is the ceWi part?
[13:13:23] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:13:40] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[13:13:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6LY9q/3/ there
[13:13:51] <duch_kazatel> moving too fast.
[13:14:09] <bigLanky> np
[13:25:04] <ornerymoose_> hello, i have this partially working: i need the button to stay disabled until an option is selected for BOTH dropdowns: whats the best way to implement? http://jsfiddle.net/ggCAD/25/
[13:25:19] <ornerymoose_> an option aside from the default, that is.
[13:26:03] <duch_kazatel> ornerymoose_ there a parent element that you can bind to instead?
[13:26:34] <ornerymoose_> i mean i could wrap the selects in a div…that what u mean?
[13:26:41] <duch_kazatel> let me show you.
[13:26:43] <ornerymoose_> but no currently not a parent element
[13:26:46] <ornerymoose_> sure
[13:26:58] <ornerymoose_> i mean i was trying with if/elses last night and the code got out of hand pretty quickly
[13:27:04] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:27:06] <duch_kazatel> i'll show you,.
[13:27:14] <ornerymoose_> cool
[13:27:19] <duch_kazatel> well, I mean, you'll use that, but you'll see what the deal is in a sec.
[13:27:41] <ornerymoose_> right on. yeah i feel if youre jquery is getting abnormally long for stuff like this, you’re doing it wrong
[13:28:07] <duch_kazatel> *javascript ;)
[13:28:18] <ornerymoose_> :)
[13:34:57] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/ggCAD/27/
[13:35:02] <duch_kazatel> i'd do something like this.
[13:36:10] <duch_kazatel> give each option a value, test that, and set data on the selects.
[13:40:27] <jaspertheghost> is there an alternative to jqeury mobile listview?
[13:40:51] <ornerymoose_> oh wow, thats awesome
[13:41:20] <duch_kazatel> let the code handle the hard bits for you.
[13:41:43] <ornerymoose_> damn, much appreciated man
[13:41:56] <ornerymoose_> that looks way better then the abomination i had going on last night
[13:42:58] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:43:02] <duch_kazatel> do you see the idea though?
[13:43:06] <duch_kazatel> the event delegation, especially.
[13:43:51] <ornerymoose_> well id never think (in this scenario) to set vars like that, for one.
[13:44:10] <ornerymoose_> but yeah line 13 and on makes perfect sense
[13:44:34] <duch_kazatel> setting vars is a good idea generally - makes reading things MUCH easier.
[13:44:40] <ornerymoose_> yea no kidding!
[13:44:44] <duch_kazatel> plus it means you're caching selectors.
[13:44:50] <duch_kazatel> which is a win.
[13:44:53] <ornerymoose_> i was just doing straight up selectors last night and it looked like a giant shitstain
[14:04:39] <Schalla> Hello folks, I got a conceptual question. We are curently developing a website and got a certain issue with AJAX Reload of Content and certain Plugins. When the content is loader later on, the plugins won't work on the elements, what is the best way to avoid this issue?
[14:05:37] <duch_kazatel> Schalla depends on the plugin
[14:06:04] <AndreYonadam> I have a question. I'm going to have a dynamic amount of tabs and containers on a site. Currently I'm using a meathod that stores that instance of which container is hidden and it doesn't use the .tabs() meathod from jQuery. The problem with that is that it only works with the first tab. I tried making it loop throguh all the tabs found by class on the page but it didn't work.
[14:06:04] <AndreYonadam> Is there anyway I can have a dynamic amount of tabs on a page and have them work?
[14:06:26] <duch_kazatel> AndreYonadam jquery doesn't have a .tabs() method - that's JQUI
[14:06:33] <duch_kazatel> can you share your code?
[14:06:37] <Schalla> duch_kazatel, that is true. But I would like to approarch the problem in general rather.
[14:06:43] <AndreYonadam> Sure
[14:06:44] <sacho_> AndreYonadam, why does it "only work for the first tab"?
[14:06:46] <AndreYonadam> I need to pull it up
[14:06:55] <duch_kazatel> Schalla you can't really.
[14:06:58] <Schalla> Would triggering the $("element").<plugin>(); again solve it?
[14:07:07] <duch_kazatel> Schalla some plugins need to be initialized again on the new content.
[14:07:19] <duch_kazatel> in other cases you need to add that content through the plugin's api.
[14:07:23] <sacho_> Schalla, depends on the plugin.
[14:07:27] <duch_kazatel> and in other cases you can avoid the problem entirely.
[14:07:33] <AndreYonadam> Experimental code: http://pastebin.com/Y71P485S
[14:07:35] <AndreYonadam> Doesn't work.
[14:07:35] <duch_kazatel> there is no single way to handle it.
[14:07:39] <AndreYonadam> It does without the loops and stuff
[14:08:35] <sacho_> AndreYonadam, don't put click handlers on each element.
[14:08:42] <sacho_> use delegation - see .on()'s documentation.
[14:09:02] <AndreYonadam> yeah I was just testing out to see if it works
[14:09:31] <sacho_> also, the whole data-current thing seems redundant - doing a quick select to see which element has the specific class and then toggling it off would be much less fiddly.
[14:09:36] <Schalla> duch_kazatel: I see, so it is kind of impossible. :) Thanks for your help! I think I will try what is the ebst approarch.
[14:09:54] <duch_kazatel> Schalla there is no general "best".
[14:09:57] <duch_kazatel> it's very situational.
[14:10:13] <AndreYonadam> duch_kazatel: Is it possible to make dyanmic tabs work.
[14:10:19] <duch_kazatel> AndreYonadam yep.
[14:10:26] <AndreYonadam> Woul
[14:10:31] <AndreYonadam> Without an external library?
[14:10:41] <AndreYonadam> With only like jQuery and javascript?
[14:10:46] <duch_kazatel> of course - jquery IS javascript.
[14:10:53] <AndreYonadam> yeah
[14:10:55] <duch_kazatel> it's all javascript.  very easy with just jquery.
[14:11:40] <AndreYonadam> How would you go upon doing it like generally? Give each tab and container a unique ID but same class and then set an on for each one with class and then find the nearest child when its clicked or something?
[14:11:44] <AndreYonadam> Would that work out?
[14:11:55] <duch_kazatel> not well.
[14:12:06] <Schalla> duch_kazatel: Well, that is true. The issue is that I have to find the approarch which is best suitable for the situation.
[14:12:27] <duch_kazatel> AndreYonadam I'd build a container for my tabs and bind a delegated listener to that parent and give each tab a data-contentArea or something like that
[14:12:40] <duch_kazatel> and have that data attribute be the ID of the content area i want to show.
[14:13:02] <AndreYonadam> alright
[14:13:07] <duch_kazatel> Schalla right - but each plugin is different.  you'll be best served by creating a sort of proxy function that handles the loading of new content.
[14:13:09] <AndreYonadam> I'll think about this
[14:14:13] <AndreYonadam> duch_kazatel: Should I have all the content visisble. A div for each tab. And then hide or display each one with css based on the tab clicked?
[14:14:35] <Schalla> duch_kazatel, the issue is taht it is a free opensource cms, so we kind of have to automatic that behaviour in case they add anything new, but that will be the best ofc.
[14:14:39] <duch_kazatel> AndreYonadam i'd set all but one to display: none;, but that's the basic idea.
[14:14:58] <duch_kazatel> Schalla then you need a way to register callbacks for pageloads.
[15:36:29] <melt7777> i am trying to pass multiple form inputs to a callback via jquery/ajax, i am using the awesome example provided by http://betweenbrain.com Matt Thomas and I have it working fine with the one input, but I cannot get the data to pass ajax-style (not in the query string) as an array or anything else. i just want to pass a whole array of values instead of the one. Can someone assist? I have been fighting/googling for 8 hours.

[15:37:35] <Ownix> Can someone tell me why on line 12 is reporting the varible on line 2 is undefined? http://pastie.org/private/hbufc3sv8pwbqddccg82hg#1,12
[15:39:35] <duch_kazatel> Ownix can you create a jsfiddle that demonstrates that breaking?  because it shouldn't.
[15:40:23] <duch_kazatel> melt7777 you want to pass data not in the querystring, but in the body of the page?
[15:40:28] <duch_kazatel> err, bdy of the post
[15:40:42] <Jattenalle> Ownix, is that your actual code?
[15:40:50] <Ownix> I figured it out
[15:40:55] <Ownix> Jattenalle: its a chunk of it
[15:40:56] <Ownix> Why?
[15:41:13] <Jattenalle> 'cause what you pasted should work fine, so soemthing else is breaking it
[15:41:16] <Jattenalle> what was the problem?
[15:41:32] <Ownix> I was calling the function above where I declared those new arrays
[15:41:47] <__joshua___> right.  what about the '@'?
[15:41:55] <Jattenalle> and that, kids, is why you should be careful with globals :3
[15:43:14] <antlong_> is there a recommend plugin for jquery websockets? https://code.google.com/p/jquery-graceful-websocket/
[15:43:36] <Ownix> __joshua___: ASP.NET C# MVC using the Razor view engine
[15:44:26] <duch_kazatel> i remember those days.
[15:45:20] <__joshua___> ah, good to know
[15:45:48] <__joshua___> antlong_:  you should probably use socketio
[15:46:06] <__joshua___> as a general piece of advice
[15:46:30] <Taggnostr> what is socketio?
[15:47:04] <antlong_> __joshua___ i am, but on 8080, my 80 is running nginx
[15:57:02] <KevinCollmer> Hi guys... I ran into an issue... I've got a jQuery Script running on document.ready. Its loaded in <head> and got a function. Im trying to call this function directly in html but "function is not defined"
[15:57:14] <KevinCollmer> am i missing something?
[15:58:42] <blindMoe> why is the function inside document.ready() ?
[15:59:06] <KevinCollmer> good question...
[15:59:17] <blindMoe> and normally you wouldn't call it in html.. you would call it from document.ready() or an event binding
[15:59:18] <duch_kazatel> no need for the function at that point.
[16:00:03] <KevinCollmer> thanks.
[16:00:05] <KevinCollmer> working :D
[16:00:08] <KevinCollmer> stupid me
[16:34:32] <tables> what is a good modal i can use to put my custom html in?
[16:34:43] <tables> something blank and something easily editable
[16:36:00] <damasceno> Hello. I'm trying to change the tab when the user clicks on "Proximo" but it doesn't work. Does anyone know why? This is my code, pretty simple: http://jsfiddle.net/RaaDV/919/ thanks.
[16:45:01] <decx> damasceno #nexttab not .nexttab
[17:01:24] <damasceno> decx: it does work on jsfiddle, but my code doesn't work. I get this error: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function  in this line "$("#tabs").tabs();". I'm using bootstrap, jquery and jquery-ui. :S
[17:06:44] <__joshua___> sounds like jquery (ui?) isn't loaded yet
[17:32:02] <jaspertheghost> is there an alternative to jqeury mobile for listviews that i can use for older android devices?
[17:51:30] <BlinkyBill> I have an element v.  For some reason $(v).val() and $('#'
[17:51:38] <BlinkyBill> opps... I'll try again
[17:51:42] <jaspertheghost> ...
[17:52:07] <BlinkyBill> I have an element v.  For some reason $(v).val() and $('#' + v.id).val() are different.
[17:52:44] <jaspertheghost> what kind of element is it
[17:53:09] <BlinkyBill> happening with both input and select
[17:53:44] <jaspertheghost> i have jus trecently used that function and done that … im not sure =/
[17:54:05] <jaspertheghost> wait
[17:54:11] <jaspertheghost> i dont think u can do (v) like that
[17:54:25] <jaspertheghost> maybe u can … whats the difference in value?
[18:03:52] <BlinkyBill> Sorry jasperdegroot, someone phoned me...
[18:04:18] <BlinkyBill> I have a bunch of element, and it works for some and not other ones.  Can't see any difference between them
[18:04:52] <BlinkyBill> I'll do up a gist to plunk to show what's going on.
[18:06:15] <Jattenalle> BlinkyBill, sounds like you have duplicate id's
[18:06:25] <Jattenalle> $(v) would access the specific element directly
[18:06:47] <Jattenalle> while $('#'+v.id).val() would get you the first element with that id, which might be a different one than v
[18:06:48] <BlinkyBill> that's what I thought too, but if I do $('#...') in the console, only one element is returned
[18:07:02] <Jattenalle> cant tell without code
[18:07:11] <BlinkyBill> yes, give me 10
[18:21:20] <BlinkyBill> Jattenalle, this is what I'm doing, but it's working here, so need to work out why not in my code. http://codepen.io/RhinoLance/pen/BJgei
[18:21:44] <BlinkyBill> I checked the length of the selector, and there only appears to be one element that matches
[18:31:05] <BlinkyBill> so debugging in chrome devtools, what's the easiest way to check which element in the dob a query is referencing?
[18:50:05] <jphase> BlinkyBill: by dob do you mean DOM or date of birth, and by query what do you mean exactly?
[18:50:42] <BlinkyBill> woops, should have read DOM.
[18:52:50] <jphase> and what do you mean by query?
[18:53:51] <BlinkyBill> if I do $('#...'), I want to see where in the dom that element is.  I'm haing issues with an element that appears to be detached.
[18:55:52] <jphase> BlinkyBill: I normally just view the source and search for it, then if you need the tree you can find it in dev tools
[18:56:34] <BlinkyBill> yes.  That's what I generally do too, just having troubles with identifying detached elements.  Will plug away here some more
[19:03:17] <jphase> BlinkyBill: oh like dynamically appended DOM nodes? you can search inside dev tools itself with cmd/ctrl + f to find those if that's what you meant
[19:04:19] <BlinkyBill> Yeah.  I think my issue is tat I need to re-evaluate my dom, so that jquery knows apended elements are attached to the dom.
[19:27:43] <jParkton> using jquery can I connecty to a database or do I need to use a library like the node sql one?
[19:31:23] <snover> what gives you the impression that you would be able to use jquery to do what you are asking?
[19:33:50] <jParkton> node has a module that does so maybe other libraries do too
[19:36:34] <jParkton> sup drej
[19:38:31] <__joshua___> JParkton: that is a very confusing question
[19:41:29] <jParkton> cool
[19:49:19] <melt7777> i am trying to pass multiple form inputs to a callback via jquery/ajax, i am using the awesome example provided by http://betweenbrain.com Matt Thomas and I have it working fine with the one input, but I cannot get the data to pass ajax-style (not in the query string) as an array or anything else. i just want to pass a whole array of values instead of the one. Can someone assist? I have been fighting/googling for 8 hours.  http://pastebin.com/XSkrhjA
[19:49:19] <melt7777> V i want the values to pass via ajax so it's "not" in the query string of the url (not manipulated by the visitors.)
[19:49:38] <melt7777> shit it cut off my pastebin url it was  http://pastebin.com/XSkrhjAV
[19:57:29] <BlinkyBill> jasperdegroot, thought I'd fill you in on what was causing my issue.  Within the loop, I was deleting and recreating some DOM elements I set the value of.  Because some elements were in the query, but later deleted from the dom, they were different to what was subsequently inserted into the dom.  All working now, so thanks for your help
[20:01:24] <Absolute0> Can I get .index() to return the index relative to what's visible?
[20:03:36] <arschmitz> Absolute0: yes
[20:04:06] <Absolute0> .index('.elm:visible')
[20:04:10] <Absolute0> like d'oh, bitch
[20:04:13] <arschmitz> $( "selector:visible" ).index( selector )
[20:04:35] <Absolute0> is it elem.index(
[20:04:49] <Absolute0> is it elem.index('.elem:visible')
[20:04:52] <Absolute0> or the other way around?
[20:04:53] <arschmitz> Absolute0: sorry i meant $( ".selector:visible.index( element )
[20:05:06] <arschmitz> $( ".selector:visible").index( element )
[20:05:20] <arschmitz> sorry my typing goes down hill this time of night lol
[20:05:23] <Absolute0> what does $elem.index('selector') do?
[20:05:57] <arschmitz> returns an integer indicating the position of the first element within the jQuery object relative to the elements matched by the selector. If the element is not found, .index() will return -1.
[20:06:31] <Absolute0> i mean is $(x).index(y) the same as $(y).index(x)?
[20:06:48] <arschmitz> Absolute0: no
[20:07:07] <Absolute0> whats the difference?
[20:07:25] <melt7777> approximately x - y, or z
[20:07:38] <arschmitz> melt7777:  lol
[20:08:00] <arschmitz> Absolute0: well the element you pas to the first function is the selection searched
[20:08:23] <Absolute0> I did elem.index(":visible") and go the right index
[20:08:25] <Absolute0> ...
[20:08:26] <arschmitz> the second is the element to get the index of
[20:08:42] <arschmitz> well thats not what you asked thats a mixed element and selector
[20:08:58] <Absolute0> let me see if your way works too
[20:10:22] <shoky> melt7777: didn't understand what your issue is
[20:11:07] <arschmitz> Absolute0: the difference between the two versions is what your looking for
[20:11:27] <arschmitz> Absolute0: yours will always return the index of the first element in the collection and only that element
[20:11:28] <Absolute0> they seem to be the same in my case
[20:11:42] <Absolute0> I have a child in a div
[20:11:48] <arschmitz> Absolute0: if you need to find the index of any other element in the collection you must use the other
[20:12:06] <Absolute0> child.index(.child:visible) == $(.child:visble).index(child)
[20:12:07] <Absolute0> weird
[20:12:28] <Absolute0> I need the index of child in the div with respect to all visible children
[20:12:31] <arschmitz> well if child is only one element?
[20:12:49] <Absolute0> there can be three visible children out of say 20
[20:16:16] <arschmitz> Absolute0: they are only equivilent if child is exactly one element
[20:16:23] <arschmitz> if child is a collection they are not
[20:17:18] <Absolute0> yeah child is one element
[20:23:50] <melt7777> shoky: my issue is two things:the part that says " I want to be able to have more than one input here,"   i want to have more than one field there. like i want the ajax to send an array of values behind the scenes. and all forum posts describing how, seemed to place everything in a serialized url querystring, which is incorrect for ajax
[20:24:23] <melt7777> shoky: #2 is, once i get it sent to the php file how i would decode that
[20:24:46] <shoky> melt7777: if you specified type: 'POST' then it shouldn't be sending those fields as part of the url
[20:25:26] <shoky> melt7777: you should handle the form's submit event (and call e.preventDefault() on the event argument)  instead of the submit button's click event
[20:26:18] <melt7777> so instead of $(document).on('click', 'input[type=submit]', i would use form[type=submit] ?
[20:26:32] <Absolute0> quit
[20:26:39] <jonclark> $('form').on('submit')
[20:26:45] <melt7777> ok let me try that.
[20:27:35] <melt7777> how do i add more things to value without serializing them, i tried using var value = { 'val1': 'test1', 'val2': 'test2' };  but that didn't work right
[20:28:10] <d3m0n> I am running jQuery 1.11.0, and using fadeIn on a list item. Has it always attributed "display: list-item" on lists and I've never seen it before? Or is this something new?
[20:28:20] <jonclark> you can always use serializeArray() instead of serialize() and you'll get an array of objects instead of a querystring
[20:28:29] <shoky> melt7777: you're already serializing them. you can't send things to the server without serializing them
[20:28:52] <d3m0n> Is there a way to explicitly set it to attribute "display: block"?
[20:28:54] <shoky> melt7777: and be specific about what's not working.
[20:29:48] <shoky> d3m0n: you can give them display:block  in the css file..
[20:30:11] <melt7777> when i submitted, it reloaded the page, and gave me domain.com/melt?upvotedata=123123&upvotedata2=asdasd
[20:30:21] <melt7777> which is not ajax
[20:30:23] <d3m0n> shoky: They have to be set at display: none
[20:30:36] <d3m0n> Then jQuery fades it in.
[20:30:38] <shoky> melt7777 then do what we said about handling the submit event
[20:31:33] <melt7777> http://i.imgur.com/SugTMrV.png
[20:32:17] <shoky> melt7777: is this running after the DOM is ready?
[20:32:22] <arschmitz> melt7777: your not preventind default anyhwere there
[20:32:29] <shoky> he's returning false
[20:32:40] <arschmitz> oh right missed that
[20:32:43] <arschmitz> i need to go to bed
[20:32:50] <shoky> melt7777 also you have a syntax error
[20:32:56] <melt7777> e.preventDefault() didn't do anything
[20:32:59] <shoky> look at your console..
[20:33:21] <shoky> $('form').on('submit', function(e) { ... });
[20:34:38] <melt7777> ok now the page doesn't reload but the query string hits the url on submit
[20:34:46] <shoky> what?
[20:35:17] <melt7777> [23:34] .:muaaaa:. show gratis (solo hooy) --> http://s422803032.mialojamiento.es/  <----- if you're going to spam at least get a real domain instead of a subdomain -- (ops?")
[20:35:32] <shoky> ah
[20:36:13] <melt7777> now that it's properly handling e, it doesn't reload the page, but the params do end up in the query string in the address bar.
[20:37:03] <melt7777> thank you for eliminating that fine gentleman, also
[20:37:04] <arschmitz> melt7777: did you make sure you reloaded the url without them after you hit submit last time?
[20:37:13] <shoky> they end up there?  but it's not reloading? not sure what that means
[20:37:23] <melt7777> yes
[20:37:31] <melt7777> ok so it reloads the page and they appear up there.
[20:37:40] <melt7777> so it's like ajax doesn't even exist
[20:37:53] <shoky> put a console.log('HI') in the submit handler
[20:38:04] <shoky> is your script running on DOM ready?
[20:38:21] <shoky> (in a $(document).ready(function() { ... })  or  at the end of <body> )
[20:38:35] <shoky> and does the form exist in the DOM when that script runs
[20:38:38] <arschmitz> not according to his pic
[20:38:58] <arschmitz> its just iife
[20:39:03] <melt7777> i started with this: https://github.com/Joomla-Ajax-Interface/Hello-Ajax-World-Module  and made my own module out of it, and now am trying to make it work with more than one form field, is all
[20:39:44] <arschmitz> melt thats a delegated handler
[20:39:53] <melt7777> it's basically abstracted out to MVC
[20:39:55] <arschmitz> melt7777: yours is not so that does not need to wait for doc read
[20:40:32] <arschmitz> melt switch to use a doc ready like shoky suggested or use a delegated hander like $( document ).on( "submit",
[20:40:49] <arschmitz> "form", function( e ) {
[20:40:54] <melt7777> okay i am sorry but i don't know what you mean by delegated handler
[20:41:06] <melt7777> i have code that works fine exactly right for one field
[20:41:08] <arschmitz> melt7777: it means its really listening on the document
[20:41:09] <shoky> melt7777: yeah use a doc ready.  wrap your current js code  with  $(document).ready(function() {  ....    });
[20:41:16] <arschmitz> not on the form
[20:41:29] <arschmitz> but for you doc ready will be better
[20:42:25] <melt7777> instead of the function ($) replace with the above?
[20:42:32] <arschmitz> no
[20:42:57] <shoky> inside that part
[20:42:58] <arschmitz> put it inside
[20:43:15] <melt7777> k
[20:45:41] <melt7777> no change in behavior
[20:45:56] <arschmitz> melt7777: can you post your code again
[20:45:59] <shoky> maybe you do need it delegated for whatever framework you're using
[20:46:12] <shoky> $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(e) { .... })
[20:46:31] <shoky> instead of  $('form').on('submit', function(e) { ... })
[20:46:44] <melt7777> http://i.imgur.com/SoYtPCE.png
[20:47:02] <shoky> line 24 is wrong
[20:47:07] <arschmitz> melt7777: you didnt fix your syntax error
[20:47:30] <melt7777> i added the e
[20:47:35] <arschmitz> its not that
[20:47:43] <shoky> $('form').on('submit', function(e) { ... })
[20:47:45] <arschmitz> you need to remove the ) after submit
[20:48:21] <melt7777> ouch
[20:48:32] <melt7777> nice if stupid dreamweaver would notify me
[20:49:03] <melt7777> ok
[20:49:08] <melt7777> now it is submitting properly
[20:49:27] <melt7777> but it is only passing one field
[20:49:49] <shoky> you can make "value" an array
[20:50:14] <melt7777> by using { var1: 'test1', var2: 'test2' }  right?
[20:50:23] <melt7777> json style?
[20:50:23] <shoky> no
[20:50:24] <arschmitz> melt7777: your likely looking to serialize()
[20:50:41] <arschmitz> on the form
[20:51:13] <melt7777> like this? var cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");
[20:51:18] <shoky> do you wanna submit all the form inputs?
[20:51:23] <melt7777> Yes
[20:51:41] <arschmitz> var value = $( this ).seralize()
[20:51:54] <shoky> that's an array yes, but  ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]  is nicer
[20:52:13] <arschmitz> melt7777: that will give you all your form data
[20:52:27] <shoky> well if he wants to submit more data then he'll need $(this).serializeArray()
[20:52:32] <shoky> and to add fields to tha
[20:52:33] <shoky> that
[20:52:56] <arschmitz> shoky: yeah but in his example he does not add anything
[20:53:06] <melt7777> okay so now it is placing the data in the address bar query string again.
[20:53:07] <arschmitz> oh wait never mind
[20:53:12] <shoky> he does though.  option, module, format
[20:53:14] <shoky> no?
[20:53:38] <melt7777> right now i have two text inputs, upvotedata and upvotedata2
[20:53:38] <arschmitz> melt7777: if it stoped again you likely have another syntax error
[20:53:43] <shoky> melt7777  probably you have an error again.  learn to check your browser's js console
[20:54:15] <arschmitz> melt7777: use seralizeArray()
[20:54:24] <arschmitz> it will do what you want
[20:54:50] <melt7777> nope
[20:54:52] <melt7777> querystring
[20:55:01] <arschmitz> melt7777: check your console
[20:55:03] <shoky> js console?
[20:55:06] <arschmitz> you probably have an error
[20:57:35] <shoky> melt7777:  var data = $(this).serializeArray();  data.push({name: 'option', value: 'com_ajax'}); data.push({name: 'module', value: 'example_configs_upvote'}); data.push({name: 'format', value: 'raw'});       $.ajax({ ... data: data ... });
[20:58:31] <melt7777> okay that is completely different from what i have
[20:59:58] <shoky> that's how you serialize the form inputs and add more fields of your own
[21:01:17] <melt7777> okay
[21:01:37] <melt7777> how do i unserialize them in php
[21:01:57] <shoky> using $_POST or whatever your framework supplies you with
[21:02:07] <shoky> it should be done for you automatically
[21:03:38] <melt7777> woohoo!
[21:03:42] <melt7777> i found it all in _POST
[21:03:50] <melt7777> okay thank god
[21:03:59] <shoky> groovy

[21:04:57] <shoky> thinks will keep taking you 16 hours if you just copy paste shit from unreliable places without a clue of what they're doing ;p
[21:05:04] <shoky> things*
[21:06:30] <melt7777> well thats sadly how i learn
[21:06:33] <melt7777> along with google
[21:06:54] <melt7777> usually works fine then when i really cant figure it out i'll ask
[21:07:23] <shoky> you can do better.
[21:09:06] <melt7777> hehe
[21:09:10] <melt7777> Yes i know

[21:47:44] <SuperPhly> Does anyone know of an extension that will allow me to automate Chrome (or some other browser) using jquery? I need to use it across multiple page loads.
[22:30:30] <mixlr_troubles> could anyone please confirm or deny whether this method (http://stanislav.it/display-content-from-external-url-using-jquery-load/) will work for loading specific elements from a mixlr livepage (example: http://mixlr.com/johndigweed/)
[22:30:34] <mixlr_troubles> would much appreciate it
[22:57:38] <mukesh> morning to all guys
[22:57:43] <mukesh> help for jquery
[22:58:17] <mukesh> how to get image width height for validate minimum size
[22:58:23] <mukesh> custom method
[23:22:27] <crocket> hi
[23:22:56] <crocket> I'm testing jquery 1.11 in IE8, and $('#file').text() returns "".
[23:22:58] <crocket> Why?
[23:23:07] <crocket> Is it because of modernizr?
[23:23:57] <Cork> crocket: is #file a <input type="file" id="file">?
[23:24:06] <crocket> It's <script type="text/plain" id="file">${file}</script> in <head>
[23:24:23] <Cork> try using .html() instead
[23:24:27] <crocket> Weirdly, $('#file')[0].text returns something.
[23:24:36] <Cork> uh
[23:24:57] <Cork> $().text() != $()[0].text
[23:24:59] <crocket> Cork : $('#file').html() returns '\n2.epub'
[23:25:16] <Cork> then that is what exist in that element
[23:25:27] <crocket> Should I call $('#file').html().trim()?
[23:25:48] <Cork> $.trim(...) not .trim()
[23:25:55] <crocket> damn
[23:25:56] <Cork> but ya, that should work
[23:26:10] <crocket> IE8 sucks donkey balls.
[23:26:29] <Cork> not really anything new there
[23:27:28] <Cork> crocket: but if the script tag only contains a file name you might want to use a better storage then a <script> tag
[23:27:52] <crocket> Cork, like?
[23:28:17] <Cork> a data-filename="2.epub" attribute on what ever element you like
[23:28:32] <Cork> like <head> even
[23:29:27] <Cork> then you just do $('element selector').data('filename')
[23:32:17] <lite_> Is it possible to find the first child of an element that had a certain attribute?
[23:33:20] <Cork> lite_: yes, though it is quite unperformant
[23:33:54] <Cork> $(this).find('[attribute_name]').first()
[23:37:08] <crocket> Cork : wow
[23:37:23] <crocket> Cork : what about <html data-filename="bleh">?
[23:37:38] <Cork> crocket: it is valid, though a bit hard to access
[23:37:51] <crocket> Why is it hard?
[23:37:52] <Cork> $(docuemnt.documentElement).data
[23:40:29] <crocket> Damn
[23:48:50] <crocket> Do es5-shim and modernizr help jquery parse XML?
[23:49:00] <crocket> var a= "xmlText";
[23:49:04] <crocket> $(a)
[23:49:06] <crocket> does it work?
[23:49:34] <crocket> Do es5-shim and modernizr help jquery execute $(a) if a is an XML text?
[23:50:02] <crocket> I'm testing jquery 1.11 on IE8.
[23:50:14] <Cork> crocket: you don't need anything except jquery to parse xml
[23:50:36] <crocket> Cork, how do I do it with jquery?
[23:50:37] <Cork> crocket: $($.parseXML(s))
[23:50:41] <crocket> Duh!!!
[23:50:43] <crocket> Doh!!!
[23:50:54] <crocket> Cork, $(s) just works in chrome and firefox.
[23:51:09] <Cork> crocket: it works in all browsers, but it isn't guaranteed
[23:51:24] <crocket> Cork, What isn't guaranteed?
[23:51:32] <Cork> if you feed html/xml to $() it might take it as a selector
[23:51:36] <Cork> and then it will crash
[23:51:42] <crocket> Woo
[23:52:48] <Cork> crocket: so basically the $.parseXML/$.parseHTML is recommended cause it means the sniffing mechanics of $() won't kick in
[23:55:57] <crocket> Cork, sniffing sounds dirty.
[23:56:14] <Cork> crocket: well if you have overloaded functions you have to
