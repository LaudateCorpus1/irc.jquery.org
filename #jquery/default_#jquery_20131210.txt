[00:11:48] <_rgn> values? same way as always
[00:11:56] <_rgn> keys? obj['hello.world']
[00:12:06] <_rgn> zumba_addict: ^
[00:12:15] <zumba_addict> yup, I got it
[00:12:18] <zumba_addict> :)
[00:12:21] <zumba_addict> took me a while
[00:15:37] <Jac0bz1> I'm trying to load an iframe, and when that is done, run a function inside that exists inside that frame... $("#frame").load(function(){ var $f = $(this); $f.get(0).contentWindow.runme(); });
[00:15:51] <Jac0bz1> But I get this error: Object #<S> has no method 'runme'
[00:18:38] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:19:33] <xec_> Jac0bz1: not sure, but wouldnt "var $f = $(this); $f.get(0)" be the same as just doing "this" ?
[00:20:24] <Jac0bz1> :) You are right.. but still didn't solve my problem :/
[00:23:11] <xec_> Jac0bz1: is the iframe served from the same domain?
[00:23:16] <Jac0bz1> yes
[00:25:33] <zumba_addict> why can't if change the display property of an object when using if?
[00:26:02] <fabioportieri> because you're doing it wrong
[00:26:46] <xec_> Jac0bz1: http://jsfiddle.net/sZ8Ur/ (and http://jsfiddle.net/8W8QN/)
[00:27:38] <zumba_addict> fabio,when I run it in console, it works
[00:27:46] <xec_> Jac0bz1: are you sure the runme function exists in global scope? (not inside a dom ready for instance)
[00:28:43] <fabioportieri> zumba_addict: and not in the page? which browser are you trying? have you any errors in console?
[00:28:43] <Jac0bz1> it's in global scope
[00:28:59] <zumba_addict> no errors in console
[00:29:10] <zumba_addict> maybe the data isn't in dom yet
[00:29:18] <xec_> Jac0bz1: does that demo i made work on your machine/browser ?
[00:29:42] <fabioportieri> zumba_addict: don't you use a document.ready?
[00:29:53] <zumba_addict> no
[00:30:02] <zumba_addict> it's backboneJS mixed with jquery
[00:30:03] <Jac0bz1> no.. Do you think is because I set the object like this? $("#itemID-"+id+"").find(':first-child'); current.load( ...
[00:30:27] <zumba_addict> i'll check if my oficemates used document ready too somewhere
[00:30:58] <xec_> Jac0bz1: as long as you end up with the iframe element, it should work. but was that a "no" to the demo i posting working? what browser?
[00:31:30] <Jac0bz1> the demo worked. But reproducing it didn't work
[00:31:32] <zumba_addict> nope, I don't see any (document).ready code
[00:31:59] <fabioportieri> zumba_addict: check if element is in the dom $("#id").length
[00:32:05] <zumba_addict> it is
[00:32:27] <zumba_addict> but maybe when IF statement is executed, the #id isn't there yet
[00:32:41] <zumba_addict> ah, i'll do that
[00:32:43] <zumba_addict> :)
[00:34:19] <zumba_addict> cehcking it now
[00:34:35] <zumba_addict> Is in dom?  0  :(
[00:35:31] <fabioportieri> so you'll need a document ready callback after all?
[00:35:41] <zumba_addict> yup
[00:35:55] <zumba_addict> but not sure if my officemates are going to reject my code
[00:36:05] <zumba_addict> i'll try updating the template instead
[00:37:19] <fabioportieri> yes, try it the backbone way first
[00:41:09] <Ububegin_> Is there any progressbar in Jquery UI, which can do this ? I will start an process from my page, it will start animating till the request comes back from the server.
[00:43:28] <Cork> Ububegin_: you could do that with the progress widget
[00:43:51] <Cork> Ububegin_: ex. http://jqueryui.com/progressbar/#indeterminate
[01:01:42] <Ububegin_> Cork: jsfiddle.net/kafAP/1 , how come it is not animating
[01:03:25] <Ububegin_> Anyways, I am looking for this http://jsfiddle.net/kafAP/2/
[01:03:58] <Cork> Ububegin_: good question...
[01:04:31] <Cork> ah
[01:04:34] <Cork> case
[01:05:46] <karelbarel> hello all, is there someone using bxSlider here please?
[01:06:05] <kuemm> I store the previous submited value in a cookie. Now on page ready I want to switch the selected form option to the value I stored in the cookie. This is what I've done so far but it does not work. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/Pa96G/
[01:06:33] <kuemm> karelbarel: I am, not sure if I can help though.
[01:10:07] <Aquaword> hi
[01:10:43] <karelbarel> kuemm>I'd like to hide its controls when the carousel is narrower than its parent element, I tried to disable the controls (and also add 'disabled' class to them) in the onSliderLoad handler but it did not work for me, would you have any hint please.
[01:11:31] <Cork> kuemm: groupsel is the select
[01:11:42] <Cork> so '#groupsel select' doesn't match anything
[01:13:49] <Aquaword> Cork, how are you today? :)
[01:13:59] <Cork> Aquaword: find thx
[01:14:02] <Cork> *fine
[01:14:07] <Aquaword> nice
[01:14:34] <Aquaword> yeah we are geeks: fine -> find :D
[01:15:16] <fabioportieri> i have a page which uses several js plugins.. on top of my page i have a set of function for handling this mashup.. now i want a maintanble solution for organize this code.. any suggestion? like wrapping it all into an oject literal pattern?
[01:16:22] <fabioportieri> master Cork, any hints?
[01:16:34] <Cork> not sure what your asking about
[01:17:06] <fabioportieri> maybe i should paste my current code
[01:21:20] <fabioportieri> http://pastebin.com/LNuJPcvM
[01:22:29] <Nuro-> d
[01:23:19] <Cork> fabioportieri: structure it in files for what it's for and concat it into one file before it is served for the web
[01:25:20] <fabioportieri> yes i suppose i can add a level of indirection by placing the init functions in a file for each widgets and glue it togheter in the main js
[01:37:45] <robdev> Is it possible to refresh a PHP include via php?  - the reason I'm asking is values are stored in a session variable.  The values are the carts contents.  So far the only value I'm able to output without a page refresh is the cart count.
[01:38:07] <robdev> I'm trying to get the dropdown of the carts contents to update without having to refresh.
[01:38:32] <Cork> robdev: no you can't refresh php content without a server request
[01:38:38] <Cork> you can do the request through ajax though
[01:38:50] <Cork> and get a partial you replace in the current page
[01:40:05] <robdev> is it best to eliminate the php include then?
[01:40:45] <Cork> robdev: doesn't really matter
[01:40:51] <Cork> you can't run php client side
[01:40:59] <Cork> so if you need to get content from php you need an ajax call
[01:41:00] <robdev> Right
[01:41:15] <Cork> robdev: so an include might be exactly what you want
[01:41:24] <Cork> so you can request the included file directly
[01:41:28] <Cork> and just grab that content
[01:41:30] <Cork> through ajax
[01:43:28] <robdev> The carts contents I believe are stored in a session variable.  I tried to see what this would output and it just returned the "no items in cart" - jQuery.get( window.location.protocol + "//" + window.location.host + "/wp-content/plugins/psCart/view/html/miniCart.php", function(data) { alert(data); }); as if it didn't return the statements with $_SESSION etc.
[01:43:59] <robdev> I'm sorry if I'm lost or seem confused.  I don't have much experiece at all in ajax to be honest.
[01:44:20] <robdev> I'd really like to learn though and not be told the answer so I can understand..
[01:49:17] <robdev> Sorry :s
[01:58:16] <iaj> Hi there ;=-)
[01:59:58] <Aquaword> hi
[02:02:32] <jop008> Any help on this? http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/106/
[02:02:54] <jop008> DOM traversing how to reach a parent element
[02:03:04] <Laban> Hello
[02:03:45] <iaj> Is there an easy way to have a h2 that has an active class.. and to either have a text "(click to open)" if its inactive or "(click to close)" in it if its active?
[02:05:06] <Cork> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/107/
[02:05:57] <jop008> thanks why is it prev?
[02:06:25] <Cork> jop008: cause h3 isn't a parent
[02:06:39] <Cork> so you need to find the closest sibling and then get the previous sibling to find it
[02:06:57] <jop008> So instead you walk to the parent witch collapsable content
[02:07:53] <Cork> jop008: you can do prev('h3') if you want
[02:07:55] <jop008> but from collapsable to h3 is not prev
[02:08:18] <Cork> jop008: it is
[02:08:19] <jop008> h3 is a child of collapse
[02:08:36] <Cork> check the generated structure
[02:08:42] <jop008> okay
[02:08:54] <Laban> I need some design advice. I need to set up a permission/access matrix of about 60 cols and 60 rows. Today I have it built up with select boxes in each cell, and it's very squeezed together.
[02:09:19] <Laban> I'm thinking to use multiple state checkboxes or something instead. What would you guys do?
[02:09:39] <Laban> It's also crucial that it works with keyboard navigation as well as clicking.
[02:10:11] <Laban> Each select box today have 3-4 options.
[02:16:38] <jop008> Is there a way to reach the h3 text ?
[02:16:52] <jop008> Adres and other fields in fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/108/
[02:16:54] <Cork> .text()
[02:16:54] <b-ot> Cork: usually nicer
[02:17:00] <jop008> okay
[02:17:13] <ghostlines> hey y'all, if I select an iframe via $('#iframe-name') why can't I run contentWindow commands like when I normally do getElementById('iframe-name') ?
[02:17:49] <ghostlines> or rather, how can i run these content window commands in the jquery way
[02:18:42] <jop008> with .text() I got also click to expand contents
[02:19:06] <Cork> jop008: then you need to use .find to find a closer child with just that content
[02:25:18] <xec_> ghostlines: $("#id")[0].contentWindow or $("#id").get(0).contentWindow
[02:25:46] <bigbugjava> I cant find the right way to load pages html(there div containers) and then load their javascript, it gets all messy, even with callback or preventDefault
[02:26:06] <xec_> ghostlines: or, if you do it inside the load event, just do this.contentWindow : http://jsfiddle.net/sZ8Ur/
[02:26:53] <ghostlines> haha thanks again man, you're in all these channels :)
[02:27:05] <xec_> :D
[02:28:03] <jop008> This is the HTML tree <span class="ui-btn-text">Adres<span class="ui-collapsible-heading-status"> click to expand contents</span></span>
[02:28:14] <jop008> How to get only adres?
[02:28:53] <bigbugjava> xec_ Hi, question, if you like to load a page into a place on index.html lets say content.html #container but you also like to load he's script thats inside content.html? ( tried loading content.html complete works, but crashs other links on nav when clicked).
[02:29:32] <BinaryKitten> jop008 var btn $('.ui-btn-text').clone(); btn.children().remove();  var txt = btn.text();
[02:29:54] <BinaryKitten> the clone is important to not break the items on screen
[02:30:34] <bigbugjava> jop008 you can also give it an uniq ID and get doc by ID, I think...try Binary first
[02:31:01] <jop008> Okay a lot of items with this on my site I try the btn way
[02:31:07] <BinaryKitten> bigbugjava giving it an id won't give only the Adres part
[02:31:16] <BinaryKitten> since the other items are inside it
[02:31:29] <BinaryKitten> bigbugjava. use a callback and parse it
[02:31:58] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[02:32:06] <bigbugjava> BinaryKitten tried callbacks
[02:32:08] <bigbugjava> no luck there
[02:32:13] <BinaryKitten> actually do the scripts appear in the #contaner
[02:32:14] <bigbugjava> driving me NUTS
[02:32:23] <bigbugjava> yeah..
[02:32:32] <BinaryKitten> and you're using .load?
[02:32:35] <bigbugjava> yes
[02:32:39] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[02:32:48] <jop008> Works fine! thx
[02:32:51] <BinaryKitten> have you thought about delegation?
[02:32:58] <BinaryKitten> jop008 np
[02:33:30] <bigbugjava>    $('article').load("pages/builder.html  #G_Container); loads div good, but without script $('article').load("pages/builder.html); loads it good with script, but crashs after
[02:33:36] <bigbugjava> delegation ? meaning?
[02:33:57] <BinaryKitten> what are the scripts meant to do?
[02:34:06] <BinaryKitten> ?delegation
[02:34:06] <b-ot> BinaryKitten: Info: http://pxlz.org/tZ Code: http://pxlz.org/ua
[02:34:20] <bigbugjava> BinaryKitten each page does something eles, some run to database, some load Facbook api
[02:34:24] <bigbugjava> Facebook
[02:34:35] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[02:34:38] <BinaryKitten> not sure then
[02:35:05] <BinaryKitten> normally delegation = $('#div_youre_loading_to').on('event, 'selector_of_child_items', function(evt) { });
[02:36:00] <bigbugjava> urg dunno how it helps.. not sure
[02:36:55] <xec_> bigbugjava: are the links that break inside the content you're overwriting?
[02:40:02] <bigbugjava> xec_ it simply dones't work after first click, becasuse js was loaded once, it doens't run again onload becuase that jquery funtion disables js load on page, or something like that I read
[02:40:10] <bigbugjava> tried calling it on callbacks
[02:40:18] <bigbugjava> tried preventDefault
[02:43:21] <bigbugjava> ummm the only solution I can think on is loading the div, and let user click to active JS, but it's poor
[02:51:17] <iaj> Hi there guys, guess I need a hand.. is there a way when I have a <h2>...<span class="foo">some text here</span></h2>  to have the "some text here" inside the span toggle when the h2 is clicked?
[02:51:58] <Cork> iaj: just set a class on the h2 and switch the span in css
[02:52:26] <iaj> How does a switch the span in css look like?
[02:52:44] <iaj> with :content?
[02:53:25] <Cork> h2.type2 .bar { display: inline } h2.type2 .foo { display: none; }
[02:53:50] <iaj> ah so I have two different spans there?
[02:58:00] <Cork> iaj: yes
[03:01:33] <iaj> like a charm, thank you
[03:01:45] <iaj> @ Cork
[04:03:18] <Promess> is there a way to do an if statment to see if a data count is 0 or not and then do a task?
[04:03:42] <Cork> Promess: "data count"?
[04:04:00] <Cork> that question is WAY to generic to answer
[04:04:04] <Promess> okay
[04:04:20] <Promess> i have a data-count="0" on an object
[04:04:35] <Cork> i guess you mean element?
[04:04:38] <Cork> not object
[04:04:40] <Promess> once it's clicked I want to set that data count to "1"
[04:04:51] <Promess> yeah, element
[04:05:06] <Promess> which will then fire off a ajax post
[04:05:18] <Cork> $(this).data('count') > 0
[04:05:26] <Cork> or $(this).data('count')++
[04:05:40] <Cork> (actually not sure if the second one parses)
[04:06:39] <Cork> ya ++ is invalid
[04:07:04] <Cork> or $(this).data().count++ works though
[04:07:16] <Promess> http://jsfiddle.net/a6u9V/2/
[04:07:39] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/a6u9V/3/
[04:10:32] <Promess> is there a way to set an if statement, so if it's data count is 1 that it won't work?
[04:11:47] <Cork> Promess: just a normal if
[04:13:22] <Promess> okay legit ty :)
[04:13:41] <Promess> if you lived close by cork, i'd buy you a beer.
[04:18:52] <fabioportieri> cork is terribly helpful here
[04:19:20] <Cork> "terribly", sad to hear that :P
[04:19:57] <fabioportieri> sorry i misspoke
[04:20:10] <Cork> lol i know what you meant, don't worry ^^
[04:20:12] <fabioportieri> i meant in an awesome way ehe
[04:22:53] <Promess> http://jsfiddle.net/a6u9V/6/
[04:23:00] <Promess> can you say if that js should work cork?
[04:23:52] <Cork> hmm
[04:24:51] <Cork> not sure SONG_ID is what you want it to be
[04:24:51] <Cork> actually i'm quite sure it isn't
[04:25:36] <Promess> why do you say that cork?
[04:25:40] <Cork> also the this you use in the success callback will be wrong
[04:25:48] <Cork> cause it isn't an id
[04:25:55] <Promess> what is it?
[04:26:02] <Cork> it is an object for all the data- you set to the .downarrow element
[04:26:04] <Promess> oh it's an object
[04:26:19] <Cork> you prob want data('song-id') or something
[04:26:26] <Promess> oprobably
[04:26:50] <Cork> also "$(this).data('count') > 1;" makes no sense
[04:27:02] <Cork> it results in true or false, but you don't store it
[04:29:30] <Promess> http://jsfiddle.net/a6u9V/7/
[04:29:41] <Promess> oh, so how do i change the value of the count to 1?
[04:30:01] <Cork> hmm data takes a string for the key
[04:30:13] <Promess> ahk
[04:30:16] <Cork> you will have parser error if you give it undefined variables
[04:30:33] <Cork> what should happen in the success callback?
[04:31:31] <Promess> the bg color of the parent div changes, and the count on the click object changes to 1 from 0
[04:31:54] <Cork> i think this is what you want http://jsfiddle.net/a6u9V/9/
[04:38:25] <holms> anybody knows is it possible to do something like this with jquerymobile only? http://wijmo.com/demo/v3/explore-mobile.html

[04:39:27] <corentin> hi
[04:40:11] <corentin> is there a way somehow to get my own callback called when a page is reloaded?
[04:40:47] <Cork> corentin: there is no reload events
[04:41:05] <Cork> there is unload an load
[04:41:10] <Cork> nothing else
[04:41:11] <corentin> Cork: i mean when the user press f5 for example
[04:41:20] <Cork> ya i know what you mean
[04:41:23] <holms> Cork: is there's any equivalent to that example? i don't know even how to call it
[04:41:48] <Cork> holms: i don't know much about jquery mobile
[04:42:00] <holms> regular UI would do also
[04:42:12] <holms> just want to get that menu with tab
[04:43:33] <Cork> holms: it a ton of features listed in that link
[04:43:41] <holms> check second one
[04:43:50] <kpl> A spinner by default seems to allow entering text, which doesn't make much sense. {numberFormat: "n"} doesn't block text entering. How can I do that? I tried using https://github.com/RobinHerbots/jquery.inputmask plugin, which blocks text entering text, but prevents using the spinner buttons when there are empty positions in the mask. Any ideas?
[04:43:52] <holms> that one is basic
[04:45:07] <holms> Cork: http://wijmo.com/demo/v3/samples/appview/overview/index.html
[04:45:31] <holms> would be nice to have widget like this
[04:45:48] <Cork> i think jqm can do it ya
[04:45:56] <Cork> or you could to it with simple css
[04:46:04] <Cork> that layout isn't hard
[04:46:53] <holms> Cork: i can find this kind of ui in jmobile
[04:46:59] <holms> i can't*
[04:47:23] <holms> i can go with fully custom one but this just will kill my day..
[04:47:58] <Cork> holms: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html ?
[04:48:02] <kpl> The solution with https://github.com/RobinHerbots/jquery.inputmask plugin is to use e.g. { "mask": "9", "repeat": 10, "greedy": false } as mask for 10 digits.
[04:48:25] <holms> Cork: thanks!!!
[04:52:17] <corentin> Cork: thanks for your answer
[05:06:24] <Dirkos> Is it possible to get the Source from an external WSDL?
[05:13:25] <fabioportieri> source of what?
[05:15:37] <iaj> In the page source I got already a funciton defined:   function changeAddressMode(flag) { … } which I dont have access to... can I somehow bind another action to when that function gets called?
[05:16:36] <kpl> Because it is possible to enter values outside the min-max range in a spinner, how do I activate instant user feedback through validation?
[05:16:49] <iaj> Or is it possible to have the onclick event from the radio button which currently is: onclick="changeAddressMode(this.checked)"    to 2 events?
[05:17:17] <Aquaword> if I have a code on local, that use Math functions (Jquery UI slider) and the same code on a live server  works different, is it possible? the slider handle has wrong height position..

[05:56:27] <CaptainHeavy> Hey everyone :)  I'm wondering if anybody may have some hard facts as to which method of iteration is quicker than the other.  My case is this:  I can either iterate through elements by doing:
[05:56:28] <CaptainHeavy> $(tableRow).find("td").each()
[05:56:45] <CaptainHeavy> or I can store the result of the selector and iterate over that so:
[05:57:00] <CaptainHeavy> var tableCells = $(tableRow).find("td");
[05:57:10] <CaptainHeavy> tableCells.each()
[05:57:51] <CaptainHeavy> I'm thinking that the second way is more efficient than the first with respect to performance but I can't find any numbers on the net about this.  What are your opinions?
[05:58:16] <fabioportieri> my opinion is this sort of micro optimization doesn't really impact on performance
[05:58:57] <fabioportieri> if you want to do something like that make sure there is a need to do so by profiling your webapp
[05:59:33] <fabioportieri> usually the css/markup part has a much bigger perfomance hit
[05:59:42] <fabioportieri> than the js part
[06:00:43] <CaptainHeavy> Well the app has tons of JS running on it so any increases in efficiency are welcomed
[06:00:57] <CaptainHeavy> plus its never good practice to introduce inefficiencies, it all adds up
[06:01:01] <fabioportieri> but that iteration does form a bottleneck?
[06:01:16] <fabioportieri> of course but we are talking micro optimization now
[06:01:36] <CaptainHeavy> Not in the wider context
[06:01:44] <fabioportieri> yes, in the wider context indeed
[06:02:12] <effortDee> any thoughts ravenzz?
[06:02:15] <fabioportieri> but you don't have to trust me, profile and see
[06:02:16] <CaptainHeavy> I'm just looking to produce the best code possible
[06:02:38] <CaptainHeavy> If I can optimize it, I will :)
[06:03:58] <CaptainHeavy> To me, the second way is more efficient since you only crawl the DOM once then use local memory to access the elements
[06:06:58] <fabioportieri> yes, chaching is faster
[06:07:10] <fabioportieri> caching
[06:23:13] <kpl> I have: <div><label for="nbrofrows">Number of rows</label><input style="width:40px;" id="nbrofrows"></div>      and: $("#nbrofrows").spinner({ numberFormat: "n", min: 1, max: 999 });     Which params to add here to get instant validation after each keyup? $("#nbrofrows").validate({
[06:26:40] <kpl> Currently my input has: novalidate="novalidate"
[06:29:21] <roflmaus> How do i programmatically attach an image to an <input type=file> so that it will be sent when the form is submitted?
[06:30:40] <slax0r> what kind of image?
[06:30:44] <slax0r> from where?
[06:30:53] <slax0r> from clients hdd?

[06:35:58] <Cork> heh
[06:35:59] <coRz> Hey
[06:36:19] <grafi> seutje wut
[06:36:20] <grafi> xD
[06:36:38] <coRz> did anyone stumble across jquery sortable offset top incorrect calc?
[06:36:54] <effortDee> hi i want to add an image when a submit button is passed for an email form and then add some attributes to the end of this image which has firstname, lastname, email, email confirm tags on it so that it gets sent to analytics
[06:37:00] <coRz> im draging a sortable element and seems like the offset top is way too high
[06:37:05] <effortDee> don't know what im looking at but so far i've written a submit
[06:37:49] <seutje> grafi: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnFr-DOPf8
[06:38:16] <grafi> nerd
[06:38:16] <grafi> :P
[06:59:08] <effortDee> hi, i'm trying to get an email form submission analytics tag(image) added to it when successful: http://pastebin.com/6DNTke8J I've done this so far were i add the image with the tags at the end but don't know if this is right? Any help would be mint
[07:00:31] <Cork> effortDee: well you are creating in incomplete <img> tag
[07:00:33] <Cork> in a string
[07:00:44] <Cork> what are you planing to do with it?
[07:01:06] <VictorCL> why jquery mobile shows what you can do .. but doestn show the code example on the docs?
[07:01:28] <VictorCL> like " You can also use listviews inside a collapsible set (accordion) to visually group the list and ensure that only a single item can be open at once. The example below shows a collapsible set with various listviews inside. "
[07:01:41] <effortDee> Cork
[07:01:41] <VictorCL> but it doesnt show you the code to achive that .. weird
[07:02:07] <effortDee> i'm trying to get the tags to the end of the img which should be fired when a submission form is created to sign up to an email newsletter
[07:02:27] <Cork> effortDee: uh, what?
[07:02:41] <Cork> you want to show an image when the form is submitted or what?
[07:02:46] <Cork> and where?
[07:02:54] <Cork> if that is the case
[07:03:07] <effortDee> i have an email submission form, i need an image which is the analytics firing with the tags at the end of the image
[07:03:35] <effortDee> so the image fires when the form is submmited with the tags at the end of it which are the information pulled in from that form
[07:03:52] <Cork> effortDee: image tags doesn't fire
[07:04:19] <Cork> but if you want them to make a request you have to append the img tag in the dom
[07:04:23] <effortDee> i would like the image to fire
[07:04:24] <effortDee> append
[07:04:26] <effortDee> thought so
[07:04:58] <effortDee> jQuery('#signup').append(imgSRC);
[07:04:59] <effortDee> like that?
[07:05:31] <Cork> that is one way to do it yes
[07:05:56] <kpl> Howto set validation for a single field with the jq validation plugin, i.e. instead of setting for a form and specifying element names?
[07:06:18] <effortDee> so im close to doing it
[07:06:22] <effortDee> as its confusing to me
[07:06:34] <effortDee> and im trying to work this out from scratch
[07:06:38] <effortDee> and i have ltd jquery
[07:07:41] <effortDee> and if i want to pull in the information for the firstname, surname and email i'd have to do:
[07:08:22] <effortDee> var fname = 'name';
[07:08:23] <effortDee> something like that
[07:10:04] <effortDee> mmmmmph
[07:16:04] <VictorCL> I dont understand the docs    http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/docs/lists/lists-nested.html
[07:16:12] <VictorCL> it just shows the example but not the code
[07:16:17] <VictorCL> where can I get code examples?
[07:17:02] <jedimind> inspect the page ?
[07:17:04] <jedimind> view the source?
[07:17:31] <VictorCL> jedimind cannot do that as jquery mobile transform the original html into something else
[07:17:43] <jedimind> ...
[07:18:07] <jedimind> the web developer toolbar lets you inpsect code currently in the DOM
[07:18:23] <jedimind> also what it transforms TO is not as important as what they wrote to get to that point
[07:18:33] <jedimind> anyway, you can always view it on github
[07:18:35] <jedimind> to see how they did each page
[07:18:58] <jedimind> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/demos
[07:19:15] <VictorCL> is dumb to make a doc like that without examples of code
[07:19:26] <jedimind> okay
[07:27:45] <bigbugjava> I had a question before about loading html pages with .load method.. that loads js only once on other nav clicks page loads without js, I read that jQuery.globalEval invokes ex.js, anyone knows how to use it?
[07:42:25] <furry_monkey> Hi all, I'm having a little trouble with a (very small) jquery plugin which allows me to replace checkboxes with my own icon. I've asked a question on StackOverFlow but no one has so far been able to help me. If any of you gurus fancied taking a look I'd be very grateful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20496054/jquery-custom-checkbox-not-updating-as-expected
[07:43:48] <effortDee> coudln't you just use a background image instead furry_monkey
[07:43:54] <effortDee> instead of the jquery
[07:43:57] <effortDee> on the checkbox
[07:45:19] <effortDee> set it as background none on the input
[07:45:21] <furry_monkey> effortDee I'm not really all that familiar with jquery at the minute, I'm learning fast though! I've come this far with this wee plugin, I'd like to just find out how to sort it for my own satisfaction.
[07:45:21] <furry_monkey> any ideas?
[07:45:45] <effortDee> and then add another class to the input just then control the new images you're adding as the radio buttons
[07:45:49] <effortDee> not really sorry, bit busy atm
[07:46:07] <effortDee> where are you learning jquery?
[07:46:24] <furry_monkey> I know if I click more than one of those inputs and hit refresh, then the correct number (1) of checkboxes are checked. So it's working at clearing the boxes, just not this extra bit
[07:47:02] <furry_monkey> I'm just learning on the internet by reading things as I need to
[07:49:25] <furry_monkey> is anyone else able to help me :(
[07:50:14] <effortDee> furry_monkey if you be patient someone will, good guys in here! :)
[07:51:47] <furry_monkey> thanks effortDee
[07:52:53] <effortDee> just ask every so often and someone should be along
[07:55:14] <pbodymind> yay
[07:55:52] <pbodymind> ppl is it possible to parse the name of a id.. so that if its formed like: goto_name1 or goto_name2 ... i will do an action based on the name ?
[07:58:25] <NoiseEee> pbodymind: sure, but it suggests you're using IDs for a reason other than intended, and you could probably put that other information in an attribute such as 'data-' or 'name'
[07:58:35] <NoiseEee> ie: codesmellish
[07:58:48] <pbodymind> yess that seems a better approach
[07:58:54] <pbodymind> i will do a fiddle now
[08:14:01] <ghostlines> hey, so basically all jquery scripts have to be surrounded by  (function($)  and  })(jQuery); to run?
[08:14:17] <ghostlines> I was always using the dollar sign but never wrote a script from scratch
[08:15:48] <myosotis> ghostlines, no, that's only necessary if you want to ensure the jQuery object is available as $, even when jQuery.noConflict() is called
[08:16:12] <ghostlines> ohh
[08:16:29] <furry_monkey> Hi all, I'm having a little trouble with a (very small) jquery plugin which allows me to replace checkboxes with my own icon. I've asked a question on StackOverFlow but no one has so far been able to help me. If any of you gurus fancied taking a look I'd be very grateful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20496054/jquery-custom-checkbox-not-updating-as-expected
[08:17:10] <ghostlines> so I just have to add the jquery script tag to my header and then I can just use the dollar sign in another script?
[08:18:12] <ghostlines> myosotis:  I'm getting some errors in the console about the dollar sign if I don't surround the script with what I just mentioned
[08:18:30] <myosotis> something is probably calling noConflict()
[08:18:53] <myosotis> which means that in this specific case, you have to surround your jQuery code with that wrapper you pasted if you want to use $ instead of jQuery
[08:19:14] <myosotis> you can just do things like jQuery('.myclass') instead of $('.myclass');
[08:21:37] <ghostlines> ahh k thanks will try that
[08:24:40] <ghostlines> ok but when I surrounded it with the wrapper I'm getting an error saying it can't find jQuery
[08:24:56] <ghostlines> how do I declare jQuery somewhere
[08:26:33] <insel> is there an ide or gui building tool that can handle responsive jquery/jqm structurs?
[08:26:50] <insel> other than the "great" tool on jqm-website
[08:28:51] <pbodymind> ei... im going around and around with this fiddle.. anyone can check why is my function not defined? http://jsfiddle.net/LD3ZB/21/view/
[08:28:53] <pbodymind> thank
[08:30:25] <pbodymind> sorry.. i meant this one http://jsfiddle.net/LD3ZB/23/
[08:30:34] <NoiseEee> pbodymind: because you're defining functions within a function
[08:30:47] <NoiseEee> and they're not in scope any longer when you try to call them
[08:30:59] <pbodymind> i missed a bracket?
[08:31:11] <pbodymind> i should be out of document ready?
[08:31:46] <NoiseEee> any functions that you plan on calling should definitely not be defined in the document.ready callback
[08:32:07] <Relequestual> I agree with NoiseEee . pbodymind, what you probably want to do is define a click action within the document ready function, which can then call the smoothscroolto function
[08:32:30] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/LD3ZB/25/ @ pbodymind
[08:33:54] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/LD3ZB/26/ really, but take out inline JS
[08:34:02] <NoiseEee> you should not be using inline JS.  good luck.
[08:35:46] * jedimind hugs NoiseEee

[09:03:02] <fosser_josh> I am populating data in callback function. But somehow it doesnot work 1st time. But when i press button again which calls callback function. it populate data in div
[09:05:21] <joroci> fosser_josh can you provide a test case?
[09:05:34] <portegno> joraci I can't access all objects by using

[09:35:42] <limpc> hi guys. i have a jquery carousel widget which is using overflow: hidden to hide images beyond the scroll panel.  I am trying to implement draggable on the images so they can be drag/dropped (via clone helper) to another div.  drag/drop works, but the dragged image disappears once you drag it outside of the div, until it is dropped.  is there any way to fix this?
[09:36:23] <fabioportieri> make it position : absolute, maybe
[09:37:01] <limpc> nm just solved it with appendTo
[09:48:48] <kpl> Howto select an element with a certain data value?  E.g. I have an element with data-something="somevalue". Howto select that element?
[09:50:10] <kpl> So I'm not asking for howto get the data value of a known element. But how to select (find) the element where data-something="somevalue".
[09:50:30] <kpl> Do I need to iterate manually and compare?
[09:52:26] <limpc> .data
[09:52:42] <NoiseEee> $('[data-something="someValue"]')
[09:52:58] <NoiseEee> .data won't work as a selector for 'data-' attributes
[09:53:12] <limpc> oh
[09:55:47] <kpl> NoiseEee: thanks, that seems to be the same as some other info I just found. It was claimed that I might need to use $('*[
[09:56:30] <NoiseEee> kpl: probably helpful if you know the element, ie $('p[data-something
[09:59:58] <kpl> Can I use several $(document).ready(function () {  in the same file?
[10:00:24] <NoiseEee> well ideally, you should be putting all your document.ready functions/inits into that one call
[10:00:55] <NoiseEee> $(document).ready(function() { firstThing(); secondThing(); new somethingElse(); })
[10:02:10] <kpl> But I MAY have several of them, which will all be executed at doc ready?
[10:02:27] <DjMadness> kpl: it will work ie multiple files etc
[10:04:14] <DjMadness> guys, is there any way to make this http://pastebin.com/zRHhX7id a bit more object oriented than i am doing now with an array ?
[10:04:24] <kpl> If I load a partial vie with ajax, and it contains $(document).ready(function () {, docready it wil be executed after the ajax load? And it will be executed for all of the current doc (i.e. not only my partial)?
[10:05:44] <NoiseEee> kpl: no it will not, the document has already loaded.
[10:06:36] <kpl> You mean docready is not supposed to run at all?
[10:07:20] <DjMadness> kpl: (document).ready is when the document has been loaded (the web page)
[10:08:41] <Cork> kpl: ready is a helper function that wraps two dom events
[10:08:49] <Cork> DOMContentLoaded and onload
[10:09:24] <Cork> those two fire when the original pages dom has been constructed, and secondly when external media has been loaded
[10:10:01] <Cork> it then keeps this info and if you give it a callback after any of these two events has fired it will just immediately call your function
[10:10:31] <Cork> so if you pass a function to ready in an ajax call it will run, but it won't wait for anything

[10:13:13] <Cork> skullcrasher: well check that the input field has a name and value in the form when you submit it
[10:13:19] <kpl> (html contains the partial to display). If this html contains script with (document).ready, then that docready seems to be executed.
[10:13:27] <Cork> skullcrasher: if that happens open your browser console and check what the params contains
[10:13:50] <Cork> kpl: yes, but they won't wait for anything
[10:14:09] <Cork> kpl: so if you run those before the element in the partial is added, the code will fail
[10:16:24] <kpl> Cork: OK, so docready script in the ajax loaded partial may be executed before the appendTo has completed. In this the docready script is part of the appendTo.
[10:16:58] <Cork> kpl: doc ready in a partial is EXACTLY the same as (function() {})() in a partial
[10:17:24] <Cork> kpl: so yes ready means nothing in partials
[10:17:30] <kpl> In fact, this is why I separated Data into Data.html and Data.script, to call appendTo first with Data.html and then eval(Data.script)
[10:18:07] <kpl> Should that be safer (when it comes to execution order)?
[10:18:28] <sparr> http://jsfiddle.net/sparr/78XQb/9/ How can I alert(foo+2) in addition to the exiting alert(foo), using only a userscript (that is, only by adding javascript outside of the existing script, not by modifying it)?
[10:18:30] <Cork> eh...
[10:18:43] <Cork> kpl: yes though eval....
[10:19:02] <Cork> on the other hand injecting script tags isn't any better
[10:19:31] <kpl> I cannot see why eval is worse than script tag injected into the html.
[10:20:22] <Cork> kpl: eval has a few scope problems
[10:20:30] <Cork> new Function() is better
[10:20:35] <ermadd> is jquery mobile moving away from data- calls instead going directly for class ui stuff? Inserting the class stuff would speed things up
[10:20:45] <Cork> kpl: anyway you basically have two options
[10:21:02] <Cork> 1. send html and script separately (like you just showed)
[10:21:10] <kpl> Cork: Do you have link to "new Function"?
[10:21:11] <Cork> 2. encode the html inside the js
[10:21:22] <Cork> ?mdn Function
[10:21:24] <b-ot> Cork: Function - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function
[10:22:38] <Cork> kpl: i used to go with option 2
[10:22:43] <kpl> I have also done your second option, creating html and js using c# string functions. Not much help from IDE there.
[10:22:48] <Cork> it is actually a quite nice solution
[10:23:11] <Cork> kpl: well just have a partial html and let the server serialize it into the string
[10:23:19] <Cork> then you get all the ide support you need
[10:23:50] <kpl> Yes, that's what I now do with a RenderRazorViewToString()
[10:24:14] <Cork> now days i've moved over to csp so none of these is an option :)
[10:24:59] <kpl> But then there is jQuery for the elements, and that's why I added that in a docready function in the razor view. But now I understand I have to separate that js.
[10:25:27] <Cork> kpl: html in js works
[10:25:31] <Cork> js in html doesn't
[10:25:47] <kpl> csp?
[10:25:55] <Cork> js and html separately and letting the site handle when things are called works too
[10:26:04] <Cork> kpl: Content Security Policy
[10:26:17] <Cork> basically it blocked new Function, eval and inline scripts
[10:26:22] <Cork> along with a few other things
[10:27:02] <kpl> Which server lang do you use?
[10:27:34] <Cork> mainly go, ruby and python
[10:27:39] <Cork> some php, but not much
[10:28:01] <grafi> go
[10:28:03] <grafi> cool
[10:28:04] <Cork> i try very hard to stay away from java and .net for server language
[10:28:13] <kpl> I come from general c++, and started using c# for web.
[10:28:27] <duch_kazatel> Cork why is that?
[10:28:34] <kpl> c# partly because my current collaborators use it.
[10:28:36] <Cork> duch_kazatel: cause they suck at it?
[10:29:02] <duch_kazatel> they do?  i've worked in a variety of server-side platforms and they're both just fine.
[10:29:06] <Cork> duch_kazatel: note, this is for web, they work ok for other parts
[10:29:16] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[10:29:20] <duch_kazatel> that's where i've used them.
[10:29:36] <Cork> duch_kazatel: .net have availability problems for web (big ones)
[10:29:42] <Cork> and java is just not structured for it
[10:29:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:29:56] <duch_kazatel> if you're running your own servers, .net is just fine.
[10:30:01] <duch_kazatel> but that can be expensive.
[10:30:10] <kpl> Tried mono?
[10:30:18] <Cork> mono?
[10:30:19] <duch_kazatel> it really depends on what you're doing, imo.  java works just fine, as well.
[10:30:30] <duch_kazatel> mono is a .net runtime for *nix, isn't it?
[10:30:42] <Cork> ya...
[10:30:54] <Cork> donno how it fits into the topic
[10:31:06] <kpl> Yes. I tested it to run mvc on RHEL. The simple things I tested seemed to work.
[10:31:06] <duch_kazatel> you said somebody about availability - what did you mean?
[10:31:18] <duch_kazatel> *something about availability
[10:31:48] <Cork> duch_kazatel: bah... sorry bad spelling correction
[10:32:10] <Cork> * scalability
[10:32:11] <kpl> duch_kazatel mentioned that .net was fine for won servers, but expensive. That's why I mentioned mono.
[10:32:21] <duch_kazatel> .net scales just fine.
[10:32:23] <kpl> "own servers"
[10:32:58] <duch_kazatel> it has its own quirks, but it scales just fine.
[10:33:37] <Cork> duch_kazatel: well to my experience it scales worse then rails, and it sucks at it
[10:33:39] <kpl> Just stay away from IE.
[10:33:50] <duch_kazatel> IE 11 is fine.
[10:33:54] <Cork> ya
[10:33:54] <duch_kazatel> quite snappy, in fact.
[10:33:58] <duch_kazatel> and the dev tools are great.
[10:34:01] <Cork> ie10 is ok
[10:34:10] <Cork> but ie11 is even usable :)
[10:34:16] <Velveeta> ie 5.5 is amazing
[10:34:17] <grafi> devtools know whats up, if i open them ie11 crashes xD
[10:34:36] <Cork> grafi: lol
[10:34:39] <Cork> that sucks
[10:34:52] <grafi> i find it amusing
[10:35:34] <Cork> i have had a fun problem on my home laptop where my browsers crashed if i didn't start them in gdb >_>
[10:35:52] <Cork> never managed to find what lib was broken; but a later update fixed it
[10:36:00] <grafi> ha
[10:36:01] <grafi> ^^
[10:36:54] <Cork> was a weird effect "ok lets see why this sucker crashes" "uh... or not..."
[10:37:01] <Cork> "ok, lets run it like this then..." XD
[10:37:08] <grafi> :P
[10:40:26] <Cork> grafi: btw where is another funny part... http://imagebin.org/index.php?mode=image&id=281642
[10:40:55] <grafi> ugh
[10:41:01] <Cork> "fine five errors"!
[10:41:02] <grafi> australis sucks balls
[10:41:21] <Cork> i seriously have a hard time telling them apart
[10:41:49] <grafi> well
[10:41:56] <grafi> yeah
[10:42:06] <grafi> except australis has the uglier curve to the tab
[10:42:07] <grafi> ...
[10:43:14] <grafi> i seriously dislike what that is going to be like ... had the nightly installed for 30minutes before forever switching to opera 12.01 xD
[10:43:57] <Cork> grafi: you mean the pre chromium skin opera?
[10:44:10] <grafi> i think it was 12.01 yes
[10:44:10] <grafi> ^^
[10:44:16] <Cork> heh
[10:44:36] <Cork> well luckely there are extensions written to make the new junk usable
[10:45:07] <grafi> i feel like thats a bad compromise
[10:45:28] <Cork> not really much option out there sadly
[10:45:34] <grafi> i can see the "need" to upgrade the ui, but it seems like its not configurable at all anymore
[10:45:44] <Cork> ya
[10:45:54] <grafi> cant even drag the menu around ...
[10:45:56] <grafi> bah
[10:46:00] <Cork> that was much of the "improvments"
[10:46:23] <Cork> basically customize is limited to moving extension buttons around
[10:46:33] <grafi> which sucks :P
[10:46:37] <Cork> ya
[10:46:59] <Cork> the funny part was when testers commented on this to the ux team
[10:47:18] <Cork> and they continued to hammer "we have improved the experience"
[10:47:36] <Cork> and the testers kept listing all the things that was removed
[10:47:41] <Cork> was a nice fight
[10:47:55] <grafi> I know that type of discussion ^^
[10:48:15] <grafi> that sounds like me defending changes someone somewhere up the food chain made ^^
[10:48:36] <Cork> i find it funny that the major part of it is removal of options; but they still list it as improvements
[10:49:13] <grafi> "different is always better"
[10:49:16] <grafi> <.<
[10:49:24] <Cork> improvement: navigation elements has been merged and locked -- uhh. no, that is a loss of functionality
[10:49:35] <Cork> improvement: small icons is removed
[10:49:37] <Cork> ...
[10:49:39] <grafi> yeah
[10:49:43] <grafi> thats shitty
[10:49:43] <Cork> improvement: toolbars removed
[10:49:46] <Cork> and... so on
[10:50:18] * Cork steps down from the nag chair
[10:50:19] <grafi> next thing is changing to blink :P
[10:50:26] <Cork> heh
[10:50:28] <Cork> not likely
[10:50:32] <grafi> ie slapping the firefox logo on a chrome build xD
[10:50:37] <Cork> they would have to scrap the entire browser to do that
[10:50:44] <Cork> ya
[10:51:05] <Cork> firefox is more dependent on the rendering engine then opera was
[10:51:13] <Cork> cause it is even used to render the browser ui
[10:51:26] <Cork> (including menus and buttons)
[10:51:44] <grafi> who knows what the future will bring :|
[10:51:54] <grafi> besides death and destruction
[10:51:55] <grafi> :p
[10:52:06] <Cork> :)
[10:57:20] <javalover> i'm not the greatest with vocabulary
[10:57:21] <javalover> http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists
[10:57:42] <javalover> i want to make a list like our file system has, with the +mystuff
[10:58:03] <javalover> so I can sort & group stuff together...is there a proper word for this? and an existing plugin?
[10:58:22] <grafi> oO
[10:59:25] <javalover> ya know like +[myfolder]   and then you hit the plus & it's like [myfolder]file1,file2,file3
[10:59:45] <javalover> but then if you hit the (minus) or (-)  it collapses the folder
[11:00:00] <grafi> so a file tree
[11:00:24] <grafi> http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/archived/jquery-fileTree/demo/
[11:00:44] <javalover> yeah probably
[11:00:49] <javalover> without files though I just want the list part
[11:01:34] <javalover> that's perfect i just need the drag & drop feature & i'm set
[11:01:44] <javalover> doesn't have to be files, it's just a list
[11:01:59] <javalover> and I can add like a save button
[11:02:11] <grafi> sounds weird
[11:02:12] <grafi> :P
[11:02:57] <javalover> no it's just a list
[11:03:05] <javalover> cmon you have never seen this?
[11:03:12] <javalover> here i find you a link
[11:03:44] <javalover> http://www.teacherclick.com/winxp/graficos/ventana_explorador.gif
[11:03:46] <javalover> see on the left
[11:03:55] <javalover> i just need that part, as a jquery plugin where I can create the lists
[11:04:05] <grafi> [20:00:01] <grafi> so a file tree
[11:04:15] <javalover> but a file tree is displaying files
[11:04:19] <javalover> I want one where I display just strings
[11:05:17] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/tumblr_inline_mir6vevmis1qz4rgp.gif
[11:05:33] <javalover> bro cmon
[11:05:50] <javalover> and lol that is kinda funny
[11:07:42] <javalover> i think it's called treenode or treeplugin
[11:09:18] <grafi> so like
[11:09:24] <grafi> maybe you should google that now
[11:09:39] <grafi> i found exactly what you want
[11:09:43] <grafi> by googling
[11:10:41] <javalover> what you think I been doing lol
[11:11:25] <javalover> found it!!!
[11:11:26] <javalover> http://dbushell.github.io/Nestable/
[11:11:56] <grafi> crazy
[11:13:51] <javalover> grafi I don't have a gf but you don't see me trolling on #jquery.  So please go be productive or something lol
[11:15:25] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/SDsuaEC.gif
[11:24:23] <kpl> Cork: When you had partial html serialized into a string, I suppose you also needed jQuery for the elements. You generated js using the same method and just inserted the html before executing the js?
[11:25:46] <diphtherial> hey, do any of you have recommendations for js (or preferably jq) charting libraries? i've been using flot, but i'm having trouble zooming in and out of my plots smoothly
[11:26:03] <Cork> kpl: the ajax calls request script instead of json or html
[11:26:14] <diphtherial> flot's especially hard to work with because the plot is a canvas instead of just normal DOM entities
[11:26:19] <Cork> kpl: and the script the server sent back did everything needed
[11:27:02] <Cork> diphtherial: you could look for a plotter that use svg
[11:29:07] <kpl> Cork: I see. I checked the link you pasted on new Function. I understand it says "new" is optional. Not being a js guru, what distinguishes Function from a fuction decl is the case and that the body is in the parameter list?
[11:30:14] <kpl> Iin "Function objects created with the Function constructor are parsed when the function is created", parsed means executed?
[11:30:47] <Cork> kpl: Function takes a string and compiles it into a code
[11:30:57] <Cork> function needs to be found by the parser
[11:32:36] <Cork> js> var something = 'return 10 * a'; var c = Function('a', something); print(c(5))
[11:32:41] <b-ot> Cork: 50
[11:33:30] <Cork> kpl: Function parses the string it gets for the body of the function
[11:33:43] <Cork> executing is done on the return value it gives you
[11:34:06] <Cork> kpl: Function basically gives you an anonymous function back
[11:37:19] <kpl> OK. So it is not executed before you actually do c(5)
[11:37:23] <imjakechapman> anyone in here familiar with grunt.js?
[11:37:43] <Cork> kpl: exactly
[11:37:58] <Cork> kpl: Function just do the parsing of the string
[11:40:16] <kpl> And then the function is available in which scope? I understand itself it can only access global variables.
[11:44:29] <kpl> So what is the diff between    function fn(a,b){return a+b;}   and   var fn=Function('a','b','return a+b;');
[11:45:47] <NoiseEee> kpl: why not learn javascript before attempting to program/write with it?
[11:45:56] <NoiseEee> kpl: just you know, spend a couple days. you seem like a bright fellow
[11:47:46] <NoiseEee> kpl: meaning the obvious difference between the two is that the second is not valid javascript
[11:48:33] <kpl> Guess you're right, "a javascript for C++ devs" tutorial / cheat sheet would be useful.
[11:50:48] <Forbidd3n> What is equivalent to this now in 1.10? if ($.browser.msie && $.browser.version == 10)
[11:53:45] <Forbidd3n> ?
[11:54:19] <kpl> NoiseEee: However, the latter I wrote: var fn=Function('a','b','return a+b;');  does indeed run in Firefox..  If I do alert(fn(3,4), I see a dialog displaying 7.
[11:54:33] <snover> Forbidd3n: the equivalent to that is kill yourself
[11:54:50] <snover> (use feature detection!!)
[11:57:43] <kpl> NoiseEee: Try this: function fnA(a, b) { return a + b; } var fnB = Function('a', 'b', 'return a+b;'); alert(fnA(2, 3)); alert(fnB(3, 4));
[12:00:05] <dcherman> kpl: they're equivalent, but there's *almost* never a reason to use the latter form.  the former is both clearer and safer.
[12:03:24] <Cork> kpl: the difference is that one is built from source while one is built from string
[12:04:07] <Cork> kpl: the later is needed if you get a string from a server and need to make it into code
[12:04:25] <Cork> kpl: this is what $.getScript does for example
[12:04:48] <Cork> dcherman: actually unless you don't ever add dynamic js to the page you need Functon
[12:04:54] <Cork> *Function
[12:05:40] <dcherman> Cork: example?  and $.getScript doesn't use function, it uses either window.eval if the script is on the same domain, or a <script> tag if its crossdomain.
[12:07:04] <Cork> dcherman: eval and Function is the same thing except you get a few extra nasty things from eval
[12:08:10] <kpl> If you dont assign a Function to a var, will you eve be able to call it?
[12:08:28] <Cork> only if you do () on the return value
[12:08:44] <Cork> Function('alert("hello");')()
[12:10:10] <jcontra> can someone tell me how I would make the "options" div slide in from the bottom of it's parent div? http://bootply.com/99669#
[12:16:04] <diphtherial> Cork: that's a good idea, about using an svg plotting library; i was considering d3
[12:16:16] <diphtherial> it unfortunately doesn't make things as easy out of the box as flot does
[12:16:24] <guideX> how do I set a select list box selected option by text, and the text has a comma in it? I keep getting "Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: "
[12:17:00] <Cork> guideX: how are you trying to do it now?
[12:17:11] <guideX> $("#cboModels option[text=" + tempModelText + "]").attr("selected", "selected");
[12:17:26] <guideX> .. or with encodeURIComponent
[12:17:28] <Cork> guideX: 1. not use attr for properties
[12:17:33] <Cork> use prop for that
[12:17:40] <guideX> oki
[12:17:43] <Cork> prop('selected', true/false)
[12:17:51] <guideX> ah oki
[12:17:56] <Cork> 2. val is prob what you want
[12:18:10] <Cork> $("#cboModels").val(tempModelText)
[12:18:13] <guideX> val is a number, but I don't have the number
[12:18:18] <Cork> ah
[12:18:18] <guideX> I only have the text
[12:18:23] <Cork> aha
[12:18:32] <Cork> that makes it a bit more complicated
[12:18:37] <guideX> I can't really use the number, because the backend data design is crapp
[12:18:39] <guideX> y
[12:19:41] <Cork> simplest is prob $("#cboModels option").filter(function() { return this.innerHTML == tempModelText; }).prop('selected', true)
[12:19:52] <guideX> hmm let me try it, thanks
[12:22:31] <guideX> hmm this is why I don't use prop, it always says "Object [object Object] has no method 'prop'
[12:22:44] <guideX> I wonder what jquery it works with..
[12:22:48] <guideX> checking,..
[12:22:52] <Cork> what version of jquery?
[12:23:00] <guideX> like 1.9ish
[12:23:15] <Cork> then prop should be there
[12:23:30] <Cork> do console.log($.fn.jquery)
[12:24:04] <guideX> 1.9.1
[12:24:48] <Cork> then prop should work just fine
[12:25:45] <Cork> guideX: the reason you shouldn't be using attr like that in later versions
[12:26:07] <Cork> is that it isn't cross browser supported to do dynamic updates of form fields
[12:26:16] <guideX> oic
[12:26:21] <guideX> well good to know thanks
[12:26:29] <Cork> some browsers doesn't monitor attributes for dynamic changes
[12:26:37] <Cork> they only check properties
[12:27:25] <Cork> and by later versions i mean jquery 1.5+
[12:30:03] <guideX> hmm this seems to work best.. http://pastebin.com/4VVpkDVs
[12:30:15] <guideX> even though it has the attr, and is long winded
[12:31:11] <guideX> I don't know why prop never works :/
[12:31:25] <guideX> it doesn't work accross all projects it seems, I always get "prop doesn't exist, blah blah"
[12:31:59] <guideX> oh well, least it's working :))
[12:33:21] <Cork> guideX: sounds like your using a broken version of jquery then
[12:34:02] <guideX> I don't know why, this happens with off the shelf jquery.. probably another lib I'm using with it
[12:35:03] <Cork> guideX: this one too http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js ?
[12:35:41] <guideX> that's what i'm using
[12:35:46] <guideX> hosted jquery
[12:35:51] <Cork> scary
[12:35:52] <guideX> actually the google version I think
[12:35:58] <Cork> try replace it then
[12:36:07] <guideX> oki
[12:36:07] <Cork> though i doubt google broke there version
[12:36:51] <NoiseEee> guideX: i'd bet dollars to donuts you get that error because you're not working with a jquery object
[12:37:11] <Cork> NoiseEee: $.fn.jquery is 1.9.1
[12:37:14] <Cork> :)
[12:37:40] <guideX> oic... hmm
[12:38:07] <NoiseEee> Cork: just saying i bet he's either working on a natural DOM element, or a javascript variable
[12:38:16] <NoiseEee> but hey, i'm not rich cuz of vegas
[12:38:24] <guideX> I tried it like this, but I get it with anything .prop ... $("#cboModels option").filter(function() { return this.innerHTML == tempModelText; }).prop('selected', true)
[12:38:34] <Cork> NoiseEee: we've kinda ruled out those options
[12:38:44] <NoiseEee> hmm, i'll go back to bed
[12:38:57] <Cork> guideX: ya, that should be a jquery object
[12:39:13] <Cork> especially if the console.log test on the same place gave you 1.9.1
[12:39:20] <guideX> yeah
[12:39:32] <guideX> 1.9.1 is kind of what I always use.. perhaps I should try different version
[12:39:34] <guideX> s
[12:39:39] <Cork> na
[12:39:49] <Cork> well 1.10 is fine too
[12:39:55] <Cork> tough there isn't much difference
[12:40:19] <Cork> 1.9+ and < 2.0 is normally the best choice
[12:40:37] <Cork> 2.0+ if you don't care about ie < 9
[12:40:50] <guideX> I use 1.9.1 because beyond that, I have problems with ... if (!$.browser.msie) {  ... which I need to still use
[12:41:01] <guideX> it's in old codes and stuff, and it'd be a nightmare to fix
[12:41:05] <Cork> guideX: that was removed in 1.9
[12:41:15] <Cork> so it sounds like you arn't using 1.9...
[12:41:17] <Velveeta> there's a migrate plugin also, which should put it back in
[12:41:18] <guideX> hmmmm it's still working
[12:41:21] <Cork> ya
[12:41:31] <guideX> yeah but migrate is for "while you develop" kind of stuff, not good for production
[12:41:52] <Velveeta> it has a silent mode that's perfectly suitable for production
[12:41:59] <Cork> guideX: well those browser tests is easy enough to replace
[12:42:00] <guideX> oh I'll have to try it :)
[12:42:09] <Velveeta> it's with the *intent* that you're going to get your code up to spec w/ the latest versions, but it's suitable for production if you disable notifications
[12:43:05] <Cork> i think i've only needed ua sniffing twice in the last 4+ years
[12:43:16] <Cork> and all of it has been to handle rendering bugs in specific versions of a browser
[12:43:20] <guideX> oh I remember now, I made my own jquery.browser.js so I can still use the $.browser
[12:43:31] <guideX> that's why it's still working heh
[12:43:45] <guideX> so I guess I could theoretically put my little toe in the water with jquery 2.0+
[12:43:51] <Cork> guideX: you should learn to do it in a compatible way instead
[12:44:11] <guideX> well there's certain video things, and certain url re-write things that don't work in ie, I don't know how to sniff them out
[12:44:17] <Velveeta> well, 2.0+ depends on what you need your browser support matrix to be
[12:44:21] <guideX> so I just say if(ie) { type stuff
[12:44:22] <Cork> feature sniffing is nice when you learn how things work
[12:44:28] <Velveeta> because i believe w/ the jump to 2.x, they're dropping support for legacy ie altogether
[12:44:35] <Cork> ya
[12:44:39] <grafi> wohoo
[12:44:40] <grafi> :p
[12:44:40] <Cork> ie < 9 is dead
[12:44:44] <guideX> for instance, sniffing what video codecs your browser supports isn't easy or even possible in ie
[12:45:00] <guideX> because it doesn't support the video tag.. also, ie doesn't support client side url rewrite
[12:45:06] <Velveeta> but they're supposed to keep 1.x and 2.x in feature parity going forward, so if you need to support ie 7/8 (without browser-checking for them), you can use e.g. 1.11 in place of 2.1, etc
[12:45:13] <guideX> these things force me to detect the browser
[12:45:25] <guideX> oic
[12:45:51] <Cork> Velveeta: i thing 1.x will die in say < 6 months
[12:45:58] <Velveeta> i sure hope not
[12:45:59] <snover> guideX: uh, wat?!
[12:46:03] <grafi> lets hope
[12:46:05] <Velveeta> because we have to support ie7 and 8
[12:46:05] <snover> that is absurd
[12:46:08] <guideX> which part snover?
[12:46:24] <grafi> Velveeta dont let yourself think like that xD
[12:46:25] <guideX> ie8 doesn't support the video tag, making impossible to snoop for video codec features
[12:46:28] <Cork> Velveeta: cause xp dies in april, and 3 months after that i don't think many will use that wormhole of security problems
[12:46:34] <snover> user-agent sniffing to detect what codecs a browser that does not support html video supports in html video???
[12:46:37] <Velveeta> and we're only just now being able to make the argument for dropping ie7, since our usage data is getting low and they're about to EOL support for XP
[12:46:40] <Cork> and vista and up has ie9+
[12:46:43] <guideX> yes snover
[12:46:44] <snover> if no html video element -> SUPPORTS NOTHING
[12:46:52] <snover> feature detection
[12:46:55] <snover> problem solved
[12:46:57] <Velveeta> vista briefly shipped with ie7 though, and then 8, before 9
[12:47:17] <guideX> maybe that's an acceptable answer fro you, and for those you're building websites for, but in most real life situations, it's not
[12:47:28] <snover> uhhh.
[12:47:40] <snover> i don’t even know how to respond to that.
[12:47:48] <Cork> guideX: how would you detect codec support when nothing is supported?
[12:47:49] <guideX> ie8/ie7 will still play these videos, if you fall back
[12:47:54] <Cork> that just sounds weird
[12:48:03] <snover> “fall back”
[12:48:05] <snover> to what?
[12:48:08] <Cork> or are you basing support on what flash supports?
[12:48:11] <Cork> or??
[12:48:18] <guideX> for instance, most ie7/ie8 will play in media player, or flash
[12:48:19] <snover> if you are trying to detect whether or not you can fallback then you can FEATURE DETECT THE VIDEO ELEMENT
[12:48:32] <snover> and the <object> tag is DESIGNED to allow for media fallbacks
[12:48:49] <Velveeta> stupid laptop running out of power, and stupid user forgetting to plug it in when i sat back down at my desk…
[12:48:58] <guideX> but what about the part where you need to fallback :P you must know what browser too
[12:48:59] <Cork> snover: video isn't though sadly
[12:49:00] <Velveeta> so yeah, vista briefly shipped with ie7 and then 8 before 9
[12:49:43] <guideX> I only have this issue with dynamically generated video tags
[12:49:43] <Velveeta> and we're a healthcare consulting company, meaning we deal with a crap-ton of users that are locked down by lazy IT departments that don't allow them to upgrade except once every 57 years, when the moon is in the proper phase
[12:49:56] <guideX> if it's on the page when ti's rendered, i'm screwed, it's browser detection time
[12:50:22] <snover> Cork: actually it does for the scenario that guideX is describing, but anyway, it’s also feature detectable, you do not need to UA sniff
[12:50:40] <Cork> snover: oh, definitely
[12:50:45] <Cork> i didn't talk about ua sniffing
[12:50:57] <Cork> ua sniffing is close to never needed
[12:51:14] <snover> yeah i am talking about the UA sniffing part
[12:51:25] <Cork> like i said only situation where i've needed it is when rendering breaks
[12:51:36] <grafi> you all have the sniffles
[12:51:37] <grafi> <.<
[12:51:39] <Cork> and element is drawn broken, but the dom is correct
[12:51:53] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/wpeGo05.gif
[12:51:59] <Cork> as far as know there is no way to detect that
[12:52:02] <Velveeta> yeah i've only needed it on a handful of occasions, like to detect when table layout has finished shifting in ie7, and the phantom ghost cell issue in ie9
[12:52:24] <guideX> yeah I need it for oddities like that too
[12:52:30] <grafi> phantom ghost cell, that was a mission impossible movie title wasnt it? ^^
[12:52:36] <guideX> in those cases, I don't know which feature is causing the visual glitch
[12:52:47] <guideX> ie is just such a peice of crap heh
[12:53:06] <Velveeta> and typically for those, i use conditional comments to add an ie7 or ie9 css class or something to the html tag, and use that to reference my rules
[12:53:14] <Cork> guideX: most of ie's glitches can be handled with css though
[12:53:26] <Cork> but ya, it is a pain plugging all the holes
[12:53:41] <Cork> Velveeta: ya, same here
[12:53:48] <Velveeta> i cannot wait until all users are on evergreen browsers
[12:53:58] <Cork> evergreen??
[12:54:14] <Velveeta> yeah, like chrome and ff that autoupdate themselves on regular release cycles
[12:54:25] <duch_kazatel> and now IE11.
[12:54:27] <Velveeta> keeping themselves constantly up to date, "evergreen"
[12:54:30] <Velveeta> right, like ie11
[12:54:31] <Cork> exactly
[12:54:38] <Cork> so all modern browsers :)
[12:54:41] <Velveeta> exactly
[12:54:44] <duch_kazatel> bingo
[12:54:48] <duch_kazatel> we're almost there!
[12:54:50] <Cork> but ya i agree there
[12:55:08] <guideX> hey, off topic, but do I need to/should I be testing on this tor browser I keep hearing about?
[12:55:12] <Cork> well we are almost there; on desktop
[12:55:20] <Velveeta> and hopefully dev departments will get their asses in gear and start feature detecting so that we don't have legacy code prompting IT departments to disable the autoupdate features themselves
[12:55:22] <Cork> we a F-A-R away on mobile
[12:55:26] <NoiseEee> guideX: no
[12:55:33] <grafi> dont be such a downer Cork
[12:55:34] <grafi> xD
[12:55:40] <grafi> i was just getting my hopes up
[12:55:44] <Cork> Velveeta: users move more and more to mobile
[12:55:48] <Velveeta> we're just starting to make the foray into mobile support
[12:55:50] <duch_kazatel> guideX depends on the use case (I just showed up)
[12:55:55] <guideX> oic
[12:55:56] <Cork> and it is more or less back to ie6 again
[12:55:58] <Velveeta> and i fucking hate it, it's like stepping back into the dark ages of IE in some ways
[12:56:00] <Velveeta> exactly
[12:56:01] <duch_kazatel> guideX in general, don't.
[12:56:03] <grafi> Velveeta cant wait to support watches xD
[12:56:07] <Velveeta> lol
[12:56:12] <Velveeta> watches can go to hell
[12:56:16] <guideX> it's just an old firefox right?
[12:56:27] <Velveeta> depends
[12:56:34] <Velveeta> could be old webkit
[12:56:35] <Cork> Velveeta: standard broken all over the place, browsers that is never updated
[12:56:40] <Cork> and ... cry
[12:56:58] <Velveeta> yeah, part of the problem is that almost all carriers fail to push OTA updates
[12:57:08] <Velveeta> because then they lose money on people buying new phones
[12:57:09] <Cork> Velveeta: just try to make a webpage behave on the built in android browser and ipad browser
[12:57:21] <Cork> you will long for ie7 is all i say >_>
[12:57:25] <Velveeta> which means that a lot of users are still stuck on crap like android 2.2, with a browser that doesn't even support svg
[12:57:38] <guideX> you can almost sniff mobile with media queries :P
[12:57:45] <Cork> Velveeta: well and same is true for 3.2
[12:57:55] <Cork> Velveeta: the built in browser was more or less never updated
[12:57:59] <Velveeta> yep
[12:58:03] <Cork> they just dropped it and moved to chrome
[12:58:33] <Cork> so even as late as none google versions of android 4.0 has a crap browser
[12:59:54] <Velveeta> it's not nearly as crappy as the older android ones though.. i've had to test some of our shit on ios 6+ and android 2.3+, and the later android versions, while still problematic, are tons better
[13:00:01] <Velveeta> they at least support stuff like position sticky
[13:00:23] <Velveeta> but it still makes my skin crawl
[13:00:41] <Velveeta> there's a front end engineer here that loves specializing in mobile crap
[13:00:53] <Velveeta> we just got him reallocated to our team, now i can dump all of that on him
[13:01:38] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta what industry are you in?
[13:01:45] <grafi> Cheese
[13:01:49] <duch_kazatel> derp
[13:01:52] <Velveeta> heheheh
[13:01:59] <Cork> Velveeta: ya, me too
[13:02:00] <guideX> no one asked but, back end (some front end) web agency stuff
[13:02:06] <Velveeta> healthcare consulting is the official term i think we fall under
[13:02:10] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaaaah okay
[13:02:13] <duch_kazatel> different beast :)
[13:02:18] <Cork> Velveeta: if you want REALY fun try to add a bar to the page :)
[13:02:20] <duch_kazatel> be glad you're not in ecommerce right nbow.
[13:02:34] <Velveeta> yeah, mobile for us is still more of a nice to have
[13:02:38] <Cork> position: fixed; is a blast
[13:02:43] <Velveeta> we're seeing higher demand for tablets than phones
[13:02:55] <Velveeta> but we have……. ambitious…. product managers also
[13:02:57] <duch_kazatel> i could see that,
[13:03:00] <Cork> scroll, scroll... *wtf* it just stopped scrolling
[13:03:19] <synth_> http://pastebin.com/6Zk6s4CQ could anyone tell me why the complete function is running twice when i run "window.scroll_to_hash('#some-hash-here');" ?
[13:03:22] <duch_kazatel> tablet is a big deal right now in ecommerce and folks want to apply it everywhere else.
[13:03:36] <Cork> or even better a bar at the bottom and it just craps out if you open the on display keyboard
[13:03:53] <duch_kazatel> Cork I hate that shit.
[13:04:32] <Misan> good morning guys!
[13:04:41] <duch_kazatel> Good afternoon, Misan.
[13:04:42] <guideX> morning
[13:04:57] <Cork> synapt: only reason i can see is that you call it twice
[13:05:26] <Cork> ah
[13:05:27] <Cork> no
[13:05:38] <Cork> synapt: $('html, body') <--
[13:05:44] <Misan> unfortunately I can't find such documentation here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/  Is there a way to combine both methods of using this function? {} and true? (result merged object AND recursive? )
[13:05:45] <Cork> that means you run the animation for each of them
[13:05:48] <jedimind> good lateafternoon
[13:06:19] <synth_> @cork you mean synth_ ?
[13:06:22] <Cork> Misan: finding what documentation?
[13:06:24] <synth_> :)
[13:06:27] <Cork> >_<
[13:06:29] <Cork> yes
[13:06:45] <Misan> Cork: if I can use both
[13:06:48] <synth_> that makes sense, let me see if i can do one or the other
[13:06:54] <Cork> Misan: both what?
[13:06:56] <Misan> I can't find any documentation/example on using both
[13:06:58] <Misan> true and {}
[13:06:59] <Cork> both extend?
[13:07:14] <Misan> .... combine both examples
[13:07:35] <Cork> Misan: so you want to deep merge with an empty object?
[13:07:37] <synth_> @Cork, that fixed my problem! Thank you!
[13:07:43] <synth_> completely spaced on that.
[13:08:15] <Misan> I want to deepmerge with two different objects and want to get the result (e.g. a = $.extend({}, b,c))
[13:08:26] <duch_kazatel> Err, the second version does that, doesn't it?
[13:08:51] <Cork> $.extend(true, {}, b, c) would create a new object
[13:08:51] <Misan> no.. {} does not act as deep merge
[13:08:58] <Cork> with a copy of all the values in b and c
[13:09:03] <Cork> with no link to them
[13:09:11] <guideX> oh also, do you know what I can do about this? event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.  and it's in the jquery file where the error is
[13:09:14] <Misan> so both parameters as input work,, okay
[13:09:22] <Misan> thank you, I will try that
[13:09:26] <Velveeta> guidex: that's a chrome issue
[13:09:28] <guideX> oic
[13:09:31] <Velveeta> it's supposed to be fixed with jquery 1.11
[13:09:33] <guideX> oki, not to worry then :)
[13:09:34] <duch_kazatel> guideX yeah ignore that.
[13:09:37] <Cork> Misan: if first argument is a bool true it means deep merge
[13:09:39] <Velveeta> but that doesn't have an official release yet
[13:09:48] <Cork> Misan: extend takes any number of arguments
[13:09:50] <furry_monkey> Hi all, I'm having a little trouble with a (very small) jquery plugin which allows me to replace checkboxes with my own icon. I've asked a question on StackOverFlow but no one has so far been able to help me. If any of you gurus fancied taking a look I'd be very grateful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20496054/jquery-custom-checkbox-not-updating-as-expected
[13:10:02] <Cork> Misan: and it will merge all of them in the first/second argument
[13:10:17] <Misan> oh
[13:10:37] <Cork> with the one later winning
[13:11:05] <kpl> Cork: So if I understand you correctly we cannot rely on docready in html passed by ajax. And we also cannot rely on <script>-blocks being executed after our html is fully loaded. If i wanted to keep the html and script in the same file for the benefits that have in the IDE, is there an easy way to extract all script blocks from my html/script string to split html and script, to be able to...
[13:11:06] <kpl> ...append html first, and then run Function(scriptpart)()?
[13:11:11] <Cork> $.extend({ key:1 }, { key:2 }, { key:3 }) will result with { key: 3 }
[13:11:56] <Cork> kpl: you can have the script tags at the end of the html snippet
[13:12:06] <Cork> that would work similarly to ready
[13:12:19] <Cork> though if you need to wait for images to load or similar, your out of luck
[13:13:00] <Velveeta> furry_monkey: following the link in the SO question, and logging in w/ the TestAdmin account, i don't see any checkboxes to click
[13:13:17] <kpl> OK, so we can rely on those scripts being run after the html part? However, the browser may handle loading of img etc async in the html=
[13:13:31] <Velveeta> also, your "remember me" option is a radio button, and you mention using checkboxes *as* radio buttons in your SO question, it seems like you might have their use cases backwards in your head
[13:13:38] <Misan> thank you a lot Cork :)
[13:14:12] <Velveeta> oh i see, your checkboxes are styled to look like radio buttons or something
[13:14:25] <furry_monkey> velveeta - just where is says jelly babies AM PM etc
[13:14:27] <Cork> kpl: well it is more predictable then th
[13:14:30] <Cork> *that
[13:14:33] <jedimind> why not use css for checkbox replacement
[13:14:35] <jedimind> instead of js
[13:14:41] <furry_monkey> velveeta: yup :)
[13:14:41] <Cork> kpl: html is always parsed as a stream
[13:14:52] <jedimind> http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/UQj3q/7/
[13:14:57] <Cork> kpl: so the elements are generated as the different tags are found
[13:15:15] <Cork> kpl: the script tags are handed to the engine when the parser finds the tags
[13:15:43] <Cork> kpl: so by definition the new elements will exist the the script runs (as they will exist before the script tag is parsed)
[13:15:50] <Cork> kpl: images is ALWAYS loaded async
[13:16:07] <Cork> and the delay in loading means it might be later then you run, or not
[13:16:14] <Cork> depending on how long it takes the browser to load it
[13:16:34] <furry_monkey> jedimind: this is just the way I've been trying to do it. It might not be the right way but I really want to understand it now having spent so long trying to figure it out
[13:17:36] <kpl> Cork: I see, many thanks for all info!
[13:19:16] <Forbidd3n> how do you check if it is IE10 with $.support?
[13:20:01] <Cork> Forbidd3n: you don't
[13:20:14] <Cork> you check if the feature you need is supported
[13:20:21] <Velveeta> furry_monkey: ok, part of your problem is that that script is hiding your checkboxes themselves
[13:20:24] <Cork> not if the browser is a version you know supports it
[13:20:44] <Velveeta> so you're setting the 'checked' property to false, but you're not viewing the checkbox on screen, you're viewing a span
[13:20:57] <Velveeta> so just setting that checked option isn't doing anything to redraw the UI that's being displayed
[13:20:58] <Forbidd3n> Cork: I need to add a class to the html tag for IE 10. How would I do this?
[13:21:08] <Forbidd3n> I need to add padding to a div for IE10 only
[13:21:37] <Cork> Forbidd3n: why do you need the extra padding?
[13:21:50] <furry_monkey> Velveeta, thanks for taking a look. I have tried doing: thisBox.click(); instead of: thisBox.prop('checked', false);  But that didn't work
[13:22:07] <furry_monkey> How can I get the UI to update?
[13:22:15] <Cork> Forbidd3n: what i mean is check for the cause not the effect
[13:22:18] <Forbidd3n> Cork: it isn't lining up right. If I add it then it messes up other browsers
[13:22:41] <Velveeta> furry_monkey: try thisBox.prev().click()
[13:22:58] <Velveeta> because thisBox is still the checkbox itself, not the actual span that's representing its view
[13:23:12] <Cork> so instead of x happens so i need to do z, check y is not correct so i need to correct z
[13:23:51] <Cork> Forbidd3n: ex. if an elements width isn't calculated correctly, or a font is wrong or...
[13:24:04] <Cork> look for the cause
[13:24:50] <furry_monkey> Velveeta: I tried but it stops working completely http://renegadeox.com/
[13:25:04] <Velveeta> oh yeah, that might be causing an infinite loop :D
[13:25:13] <Cork> Forbidd3n: and if you look for the cause you often find that you can just fix it generically by changing some assumption somewhere
[13:26:24] <Velveeta> furry_monkey: try something like this: "thisBox.prev.css('background-position', '0 0');"
[13:26:46] <Cork> Velveeta: missed a ()
[13:27:08] <Velveeta> ?
[13:27:18] <furry_monkey> whats the square looking thing on the end?
[13:27:19] <Cork> .prev. <--
[13:27:25] <Cork> .prev(). <--
[13:27:26] <Velveeta> oh yeah, good call
[13:27:41] <Velveeta> looks like that doesn't work either
[13:27:53] <Velveeta> my advice would be to go with a different plugin that's better written :D
[13:28:27] <Velveeta> because looking under the hood of that one almost made me throw up a little, it's extremely wasteful on dom parsing, and that's just a start
[13:28:27] <furry_monkey> :(
[13:28:38] <furry_monkey> lol
[13:28:59] <Velveeta> like, for every single click of those elements, it parses every single input in the whole document
[13:29:10] <Velveeta> and loops over them all, typechecking them
[13:29:17] <grafi> hahaha
[13:29:24] <grafi> that sounds fine to me ^^
[13:29:44] <furry_monkey> any suggestions or should I just be going with a different approch entirely?
[13:29:44] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/ByqvAJJ.gif
[13:34:03] <Velveeta> furry_monkey: you could look into css transforms
[13:34:19] <Velveeta> they're not gonna be supported across all browsers, but will in some
[13:36:35] <sparr> I understand why browsers have their own transform prefixes, but why do they not all support the un-prefixed version once they have good support for their prefix? That is, why can't I just say transform: and make it work in every browser?
[13:39:44] <grafi> because
[13:39:45] <grafi> :X
[13:50:45] <Cork> grafi: the idea was that they added the prefixed one as they tested the idea
[13:50:53] <jwmann> The docs say that trigger() supports callback functions however mine doesn't seem to be doing anything (no console.log or alert) the click trigger does initiate so it seems to be working…any ideas?
[13:51:06] <Cork> grafi: and when all of them had come to a resolve of how it would work, and the spec was defined
[13:51:14] <Cork> the prefixes was removed
[13:51:53] <Cork> grafi: this worked well until apple programmed that they won't ever remove a prefix
[13:52:03] <Cork> grafi: so that idea has been scrapped
[13:52:27] <grafi> hm what when how oô
[13:52:30] <Cork> grafi: and the new solution is that all new features are to be put behind prefs in the browser
[13:52:59] <Cork> so basically no new features hit the web before they have been agreed upon by all vendors
[13:53:11] <Cork> (thank apple)
[13:53:18] <grafi> sounds like a shitty solution to me ^^
[13:53:53] <Cork> well the prefix solution would have worked well if prefixed properties had existed for short times (say < a year)
[13:54:11] <Cork> some prefixes existed for close to ten years before they hit spec
[13:54:20] <Cork> so... they where really hard to get rid of
[13:54:40] <Cork> -moz-opacity was one of the worst ones
[13:54:58] <Cork> it has existed between 2004 and 2012 i think
[13:55:22] <Cork> might even have been added before 2004, don't remember
[13:56:00] <grafi> really hard to get rid of meaning being afraid to break stuff when removing it?
[13:56:19] <Cork> meaning it was used A LOT
[13:56:32] <Cork> and some of them without the fallback
[13:56:54] <grafi> just take it out, see the world burn
[13:56:56] <grafi> :Y
[13:56:56] <Cork> grafi: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=765645
[13:57:10] <Cork> that is a nice example :)
[13:57:23] <grafi> lol
[13:57:44] <Cork> the flame he throw was classic
[13:58:17] <grafi> when you read bugreports for fun
[13:58:23] <grafi> you know you should take a break ^^
[13:59:06] <Cork> grafi: i didn't read it for fun
[13:59:31] <Cork> i'm actually part of the group that triage them
[13:59:59] <Cork> and this one went on for weeks
[14:00:22] <Cork> he even wanted mozilla to pay for his time updating -moz-opacity to opacity
[14:00:34] <grafi> oh cool
[14:01:02] <grafi> yeah it seems like a great example why to include the unprefixed version ...
[14:02:38] <Cork> grafi: or why to use external css files instead of adding things inline
[14:02:48] <grafi> nah
[14:02:53] <Cork> or a good reason to learn how to use search and replace :)
[14:02:57] <grafi> inline css saves so much bandwidth
[14:02:58] <grafi> xD
[14:03:01] <Cork> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=765645#c13 <-- this one is really fun

[14:03:18] <grafi> ^^
[14:03:29] <Cork> well that specific comment; sure

[14:06:56] <Cork> yup
[14:07:05] <Cork> that is why it's so funny
[14:07:20] <grafi> im just reading the one where he wants to invoice for time spent xD
[14:07:21] <Cork> there is 3-5 comments on how to fix this in ~ 2-3 mins
[14:07:29] <Cork> ya
[14:07:34] <grafi> too helpful
[14:07:51] <Cork> and he talks about manually searching through every file on several domains
[14:07:59] <grafi> well
[14:08:06] <grafi> when you have inline styles
[14:08:08] <grafi> idk
[14:08:13] <grafi> maybe thats just the way he rolls

[14:51:41] <jwmann> How do I make data() always grab from the DOM and not cache its first grab?
[14:52:52] <JackBauer24> jwmann: use .attr() instead - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14038003/jquery-selectors-and-html5-data-attributes-set-dynamically
[14:52:53] <shoky> jwmann: you can't
[14:53:25] <jwmann> attr doesn't convert my attribute JSON
[14:53:45] <jwmann> I also just found http://api.jquery.com/removeData/
[14:53:50] <jwmann> So perhaps that might do it
[14:54:04] <shoky> JSON.parse parses json
[14:54:05] <Velveeta> you shouldn't be using the attribute to store the current state of your data
[14:54:13] <Velveeta> you should be using the data store
[14:55:39] <jwmann> Velveeta: The reason I have JSON in my data attribute is because it origins from PHP
[14:55:45] <mg983> Hi guys
[14:55:58] <Velveeta> jwmann: right, but that's the default state, i'm saying don't store the current state in that attribute
[14:56:09] <Velveeta> use that to default your data store and then modify the data store to track current state
[14:56:48] <jwmann> I'm a little confused as to what you're saying. Could you elaborate a bit?
[14:57:39] <Velveeta> sure, if you store data-address="{street: '123 abc ln', city: 'someplace', state: 'tx'}" in an attribute from php
[14:57:56] <Velveeta> and then you want to use that to, say, load into a form, and let the user edit it
[14:58:03] <Velveeta> and keep that info in memory somewhere, live
[14:58:18] <Velveeta> you could say $('#yourElement').data('address') and use those fields to populate your form fields
[14:58:36] <Velveeta> and then as they edit fields, and blur out of those fields, update your address object and store it back into that data store
[14:58:44] <Velveeta> not stringify the json object and store it back into the attribute
[14:59:48] <Velveeta> so you could say var address = $('#yourElement').data('address'); address.street = '234 bcd st'; $('#yourElement').data('address', address);
[15:00:13] <Velveeta> as opposed to address.street = '234 bcd st'; $('#yourElement').attr('dataAddress', JSON.stringify(address));
[15:02:32] <Forbidd3n> Cork: I can't seem to figure out how to check if browser is IE and the version with $.support
[15:03:03] <Velveeta> $.support is used for feature detection, not browser detection
[15:03:20] <Forbidd3n> Velveeta: I know. I worded it wrong.
[15:03:50] <Forbidd3n> I can't check the feature because I just need to add padding. I am doing it with multiple <html> tags based on browser comment check
[15:04:10] <Forbidd3n> and setting class on <html tag
[15:05:13] <jwmann> Velveeta: Oh, I see what you mean. That's not quite what I'm trying to accomplish though.
[15:06:13] <Velveeta> jwmann: what are you trying to accomplish?
[15:06:31] <jwmann> I have an event that grabs the data and I use that JSON array and iterate over it. However, one element with this attribute is dynamically changed and it works fine the first time but after that it caches the information.
[15:06:44] <Velveeta> forbidd3n: so you're using conditional comments to add a class to your html tag? did i read that right?
[15:07:08] <Velveeta> if so, you should just be able to use a generic css rule like: .ie8 myTargetElement { padding: whateverpx; }
[15:07:56] <Velveeta> jwmann: i'm not following, is there a jsfiddle you can whip up?
[15:08:30] <jwmann> Velveeta: Sure, I think I can.
[15:12:29] <grafi> dymagically
[15:14:27] <Forbidd3n> Velveeta: what do you suggest to accommodate IE mishaps?
[15:14:49] <Velveeta> like, display quirks? or some other mishaps?
[15:15:30] <Forbidd3n> yes
[15:16:08] <Velveeta> just what you're doing, using conditional comments to add a class to your html tag, and using that to add targeted css to tweak your styles as needed
[15:16:43] <Forbidd3n> ok, but I can't find one for IE10
[15:17:00] <Velveeta> ahhhhh yes, ie10 removed support for conditional comments
[15:17:50] <Forbidd3n> that is what I am trying to do not, that is why I was trying to use browser checking in jquery and append class ie10 to <html tag
[15:19:12] <Velveeta> well, you'll have to sniff the user agent yourself for that, depending on your jquery version, otherwise, if it's < 1.9, you can use $.browser
[15:19:24] <Velveeta> what's going wrong in ie10 that needs individualized tweaking?
[15:20:02] <Forbidd3n> padding is off - it works great in FF, Chrome, Safari, IE7,8,9 but in 10 it is off about 3 pixels
[15:22:23] <jwmann> Velveeta: Is it okay if I PM you the jsFiddle?
[15:22:31] <Velveeta> does it make that much of a difference? and are you using a css reset of some kind?
[15:22:36] <Velveeta> jwmann: sure
[15:24:10] <Forbidd3n> Velveeta: no and it does make a difference the line doesn't line up
[15:32:14] <Velveeta> maybe you should try a css reset file of some kind to zero out all of the margin and padding for any given browser, give you a clean slate to work from
[15:32:28] <Velveeta> then its padding rules should behave the same as every other browser
[15:38:44] <Velveeta> ok, i'm out, have some web meetup to go to, and need pre-alcohol to get me chatty

[16:15:32] <sdwrage> Hey all. Anyone know of a good modal carousel plugin that displays a big image and smaller images below it?
[16:15:46] <sdwrage> the display I described would be before modal
[16:24:14] <hetii> Hi :)
[16:26:44] <hetii> If i have a form like <form id="places_form" method="post"><ul><li><input type="checkbox".../><label>...</label></li></ul>...' , This is a proper selector to get all checked checkboxes inside this form? "#places_form:input:checked" ?
[16:28:00] <hetii> Or should i use class attribute for each checkboxes and then use '.theClass:checkbox:checked' ?
[16:31:23] <hetii> hmm looks like "#places_form input:checkbox:checked" works fine.
[16:32:34] <serban> any plugins i could use to save the whole current webpage(2000x2000) as a pdf?
[16:48:25] <delboy1978uk_> i have the weirdest problem, $('a').click(blah); isn't working with two of my <a> tags! works with the rest of them!
[16:48:29] <delboy1978uk_> :-s
[16:49:31] <delboy1978uk_> the only difference is that i said var html ='<a blah="blah>click!<a>'; and $('#container').html(html);
[16:50:17] <grafi> delboy1978uk_ what does the console say?
[16:50:33] <delboy1978uk_> not a lot hold on i'll look again
[16:50:49] <delboy1978uk_> nothing :-s
[16:51:21] <delboy1978uk_> i got it to alert on all the other buttons, just not these generated ones!
[16:51:29] <grafi> generated
[16:51:30] <grafi> aha
[16:51:39] <grafi> thats the problem then
[16:52:03] <delboy1978uk_> how do i get around it grafi?
[16:52:32] <grafi> try binding the handler to a common parent, that is not generated like $(parent).on('click', 'a', function() {})
[16:52:51] <grafi> where parent is a selector for an element that is not inserted at runtime
[16:52:58] <delboy1978uk_> ah! awesome, let me try that! :-)
[16:53:04] <grafi> if you are unsure what to put there use document
[16:55:47] <delboy1978uk_> this is so strange, i'm still getting nothing!
[16:56:06] <grafi> hm
[16:56:13] <grafi> okay then show some code ;)
[16:56:33] <delboy1978uk_> hold on :-)
[17:02:17] <delboy1978uk_> 81.152.130.131:8080
[17:02:33] <delboy1978uk_> and don't worry, nothings doing anything live just now
[17:02:45] <delboy1978uk_> its the two cancel buttons at the bottom
[17:03:22] <grafi> that looks awesome x_X
[17:03:29] <delboy1978uk_> hehe cheers
[17:03:58] <grafi> so the red x thingies on the left?
[17:04:16] <delboy1978uk_> yeah if you look in trader.js the code is at the top
[17:05:04] <grafi> i see you didnt read any furhter xD
[17:05:12] <grafi> [01:52:51] <grafi> where parent is a selector for an element that is not inserted at runtime
[17:05:12] <grafi> [01:52:58] <delboy1978uk_> ah! awesome, let me try that! :-)
[17:05:12] <grafi> [01:53:04] <grafi> if you are unsure what to put there use document
[17:05:19] <grafi> replace parent with document for now
[17:05:51] <delboy1978uk_> done
[17:06:08] <grafi> works for me now
[17:06:18] <delboy1978uk_> yup me too
[17:06:22] <grafi> cool stuff
[17:06:28] <delboy1978uk_> what's that telling us then?
[17:07:00] <grafi> how you mean?
[17:07:01] <delboy1978uk_> ah wait it would be parent().parent() !
[17:07:24] <delboy1978uk_> or would it ?
[17:08:07] <grafi> are you asking what you should use a the real parent element?
[17:09:13] <delboy1978uk_> yeah because i don't want it joing off with every a tag i click, just a.ttb-cancel-order, but thats not working as you can see now
[17:09:20] <delboy1978uk_> going
[17:10:02] <grafi> $(document).on('click', 'a.ttb-cancel-order', function() {})
[17:10:04] <grafi> then
[17:10:35] <grafi> and maybe replace document with the form that contains the orders or something
[17:11:50] <delboy1978uk_> awesome we are rock and rolling
[17:11:56] <delboy1978uk_> cheers grafi
[17:11:59] <delboy1978uk_> :-D

[17:17:44] <sunbeam> when i have a page where there is a full width google maps part, how can i avoid that scrolling users always need to avoid touching this?
[17:18:09] <grafi> hetii probably maybe not
[17:18:22] <hetii> hehe :)
[17:18:27] <hetii> cool answer :>
[17:18:53] <grafi> semi-informed answer :P
[17:19:55] <grafi> sunbeam can't touch this?
[17:23:20] <delboy1978uk_> yeah because it scrolls the map rather than continues scrolling the page, its a pain in the ass
[17:23:53] <delboy1978uk_> you could detect user agent and for mobiles make it a static map
[17:25:18] <sunbeam> delboy1978uk_: exactly
[17:25:28] <sunbeam> is there some type of fix for this?
[17:27:53] <delboy1978uk_> tell google maps you want a static non scrolling map, i can't remember how but it can be done

[20:47:42] <zulcc> i just ran into a late-binding issue with 1.10.2, its a fairly easy situation: $('.mydiv').on('click', function() { alert("clicked!"); }); works when it's initially on the page, but when its .load()ed, the alert does not show up anymore, clicking the same div as before. any ideas what i might be overlooking?
[20:53:56] <zulcc> the code does not throw any errors in the firebug console btw, so that is not the issue
[20:57:09] <shoky> zulcc: you can only bind event handlers on elements that currently exist in the DOM. you can delegate the event handling to some container element e.g.  $('#mycontainer').on('click', '.mydiv', function() { ... })
[21:00:51] <zulcc> shoky: i must have misunderstood something: i thought first live(), then bin(), then on() were fixing exactly that problem (after deprecating one after another)?
[21:01:02] <zulcc> s/bin()/bind()
[21:01:43] <shoky> zulcc:  live()  was a shortcut to $(document).on(event, selector, ...)
[21:01:54] <zulcc> Oh you mean the latebinding would indeed work for #id, but not for a .class directly?
[21:01:56] <shoky> zulcc: live() was using delegation too
[21:02:02] <shoky> but it was doing it behind your back
[21:02:08] <shoky> what? no
[21:02:20] <shoky> nothing to do with class/id
[21:02:42] <zulcc> alright, so the delegation behind my back was removed, so now it has to be inserted manually?
[21:02:49] <shoky> yes
[21:03:05] <zulcc> why was it removed?
[21:03:27] <shoky> because it was a bad API, you would do:  $('.mydiv').live('click', function..)
[21:03:38] <shoky> which looks like it searches for .mydiv elements and binds event handlers on them
[21:03:46] <shoky> but that's not at all what it does
[21:04:03] <zulcc> how does it matter if it matches exactly the expected functionality?
[21:04:12] <shoky> and it always uses the document element , instead of a closer ancestor element
[21:04:25] <shoky> it DOESN'T match the expected functionality
[21:04:36] <zulcc> i'm sorry, the expected result
[21:04:42] <shoky> $('.mydiv')   <-- that is expected to search for .mydiv elements
[21:04:49] <shoky> with live, that didn't happen at all
[21:05:02] <shoky> and instead it put an event handler on document, nothing i asked for
[21:05:14] <shoky> read the docs for .live, it probably has more reasons
[21:05:21] <shoky> `api live
[21:05:21] <b-ot> shoky: .live(): Attach an event handler for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[21:05:24] <zulcc> okay, thanks
[21:06:05] <zulcc> so what i want to do is take a parent for my binding that is on the page in the first place
[21:06:15] <shoky> yeap
[21:06:29] <zulcc> and select .mydiv down from that parent. alright, thanks a lot
[21:06:32] <shoky> if you don't have one you can always use 'body' or document
[21:06:39] <shoky> but best to use the closest one
[21:42:41] <zulcc> shoky: is there any way of combining it while listing the events like this http://apaste.info/ezSe
[21:44:33] <Cache_Money> Right now when I click this button it works, but subsequent times it won't  http://jsfiddle.net/zFptc/
[21:44:41] <Cache_Money> what do I need to change to make it work on subsequent clicks?
[21:47:45] <Cache_Money> The only solution I've been able to come up with was to add an onclick attribute within the HTML of the button and a corresponding function in my Javascript..
[21:52:03] <joroci> mooooooooorning
[22:07:29] <johngilbrough_> How does one turn off the static (time out, left server, etc.)?
[22:23:42] <johngilbrough_> Ignore that - I figured it out.
[22:27:30] <zulcc> how do i retrieve an anchors' data attributes' value within "this"? $(this + " a").data("language")
[22:29:26] <joroci> you could do
[22:29:40] <joroci> $('a,this).data()
[22:29:49] <joroci> $('a',this).data()
[22:30:42] <zulcc> joroci: thanks!
[22:30:44] <joroci> or $(this.className + ' a').data()
[22:31:04] <joroci> or id
[22:31:07] <joroci> whatever you got :
[22:46:05] <taherali> Anyone here know which plugin they're using for the image slider? http://www.kinfolk.com/
[22:49:59] <johngilbrough_> I'm working on my first jQuery autocomplete project.  I've got two servers, A & B that I've made identical in all respects.  The autocomplete business works great on server A but on server B things stop happening after the GET receives a 200 OK.  Any suggestions on how to figure out what's going on?
[22:51:17] <Snowleaksange> hmm so when i add/change rows with jquery my table shifts around on the page
[22:51:22] <Snowleaksange> how i make it not do that? :P
[23:08:25] <joebobjoe> Question: what happens if I make a selection, bind it to a variable, but then delete the underneath DOM nodes? What happens to the selection?
[23:16:32] <Cork> joebobjoe: your variable will keep the dom reference alive
[23:16:46] <Cork> joebobjoe: and unless you clear the variable you might have a memory leak
[23:37:06] <Snowleaksange> ok bb 2mor :)
