[01:18:52] <killer> hey
[01:19:56] <killer> if you open facebook login page , you will see under sign up ,first name ,last name,etc//.......I need to replace that text with something funny .I have been trying for long but nott succeeding
[01:24:20] <spobat_> is $(f) the same as $(document).ready(f) ?
[01:25:43] <killer> how can i change value of  input attribute using jquery
[01:27:32] <systemfault> spobat: yes
[01:27:51] <systemfault> killer: .val(theValueHere)
[01:29:00] <killer> systemfault: what i did was $(#<id of input here>).val('test');
[01:29:12] <systemfault> Should work
[01:29:18] <systemfault> Well
[01:29:32] <systemfault> You need to pass a string to $()
[01:29:58] <systemfault> $('#theId').val('test'); works… not $(#theId).val('test');
[01:30:37] <killer> I passed it as string ,forgot to place it here in irc
[01:32:39] <spobat> The main distribution of jQuery is not compatible with Closure-compiler :((
[01:52:36] <killer> ok,can i replace aria-label in input attribute using  jquery?
[01:52:59] <killer> if i know the id
[01:57:06] <p3lim> Anyone happen to still have the Google Reader Notifier and/or source code still?
[02:05:23] <killer> ok,can i replace aria-label in input attribute using  jquery?

[02:16:09] <Zitter> hi, why $(this) in line 4 doesn't refer to #yt0 node here: http://pastie.org/8137060 ? tia
[02:25:55] <killer_> ok,can i replace aria-label in input attribute using  jquery?
[02:26:17] <exalt> hello ive got this html "<div class="entry" id="1"> <div class="title"> title </div> <div class="content"> content </div> </div>" and i wonder if im able to do something like $('.entry').('.tile').click()
[02:29:12] <systemfault> exalt: Learn CSS :)
[02:29:44] <systemfault> exalt: $('.entry .title').click();
[02:30:14] <exalt> systemfault: you mean the entry class is useless ?
[02:30:20] <exalt> div*
[02:31:23] <systemfault> Well, depends… if you simply use $('.title') then ALL elements with the "title" class will be selected
[02:32:05] <systemfault> $('.entry .title') will select all elements with a "title" class that are INSIDE elements with an "entry" class
[02:32:27] <exalt> this is exactly my problem, i try to fond out how to fadeToggle the content sharing the id with the title
[02:40:09] <GoSox> hello
[02:46:34] <PapaSierra> does XHR actually support PUT and DELETE natively and correctly? or is jquery doing something dirty and hijacking the POST to support these?
[02:56:35] <passion_for_web> Hi, what is the alternative to select tr.product:nth-of-type(N) where N is variable in a loop
[02:56:53] <passion_for_web> I dont wana use :nth-of-type
[02:57:03] <passion_for_web> How can I do this alternatively
[03:00:00] <sahbeewah> PapaSierra, jquery doesn't do anything magical. whether the xhr object supports PUT/DELETE would be browser-dependent
[03:01:09] <PapaSierra> sahbeewah: so it's all up to the browser's XHR implementation? how can we know which do and which don't support PUT and DELETE?
[03:04:18] <sahbeewah> PapaSierra, not sure. but I'm pretty sure it's implemented by all major browsers
[03:04:31] <sahbeewah> inc ie6
[03:05:16] <PapaSierra> ok, that's not what i'm observing in the latest chrome, which, if you're right, must mean i'm doing something wrong
[03:08:09] <PapaSierra> sahbeewah: looks like i was doing something wrong ;)
[03:16:13] <motaka2> can anyone explain me how the delay function works? /msg NickServ identify <password>
[03:16:36] <motaka2> can anyone explain me how the delay function works in this code?  http://pastebin.com/jvejewZR
[03:16:47] <GoSox> only you can explain you
[03:16:59] <motaka2> GoSox: :D
[03:18:57] <GoSox> If you call addClass multiple times, adding the same class over and over, does it get added multiple times, or does it only get added once and subsequent 'recalls' are ignored because it's already there
[03:28:27] <Frantic> suppose I have a <form> with some inputs in it, is there an easy way to submit this form via ajax without manually picking each input?
[03:28:41] <JenniferB2> hi folks … I am including a script that have a method call in it … is there a way to figure out what the file or script name is of the method invoking it ? in firefox there is the currentScript … but this is not cross browser … any other hints?
[03:28:43] <GoSox> dropping old IE support didn't shrink jQuery 2 by as much as I thought it would :/
[03:29:06] <GoSox> i'll still be switching soon, I already actively block old IE from my site so i'll be glad to save some bytes
[03:29:34] <crab> i didn't notice much of a difference. what is it, a couple of kb?
[03:29:40] <Frantic> I'm thinking of doing $("form").submit(function() { var data = $(this).find("input").map(); $.post(this.action, data); })
[03:29:54] <GoSox> i think it was 10-15KB in minified form
[03:30:12] <Frantic> but I guess someone would have already done that by now, and probabably better, could someone point me to something like that if it exists?
[03:33:10] <crab> GoSox: 88K vs. 96K it seems
[03:33:38] <GoSox> 84k to 93k so says my Finder
[03:34:04] <JenniferB2> basically, in my script … i have this method call : doSomething() … in doSomething() I want to know what the script name was that included that piece …
[03:34:05] <GoSox> but OS X uses 1000 not 1024 to calculate sizes these days… although that should make my sizes bigger not smaller
[03:36:39] <crab> i think du is rounding up to 4KB blocks or something. it's 83612 bytes vs. 93107 bytes (== 81.65 vs. 90.92 KiB)
[03:37:05] <GoSox> still i'll take 9kb
[03:37:11] <crab> so about 9KB less, whichever way you look at it.
[03:37:17] <GoSox> 9kb x a billion adds up
[03:37:25] <GoSox> and yes i'm an optimist :)
[03:37:37] <crab> kilobillions!
[03:46:25] <passion_for_web> does anyone know an alternate way of selecting tr.product:nth-of-type(N)
[03:51:51] <GoSox> i hate how you the fancy animations sometimes make things happen out of order
[03:52:26] <GoSox> i wish there was an easier way to sometimes purposely do things not asynchronously
[04:02:47] <Lost123> hi i am trying to display only Us cities using remote autocomplete, but doesn't work. http://jsfiddle.net/MvcJr/
[04:06:32] <OnkelTem> Hi all. I'm trying to solve a problem with Javascript and associative arrays and then I thought - maybe jQuery has something for this?
[04:06:47] <OnkelTem> My original question was: What is the easiest way to create a stack of pairs {key: value} so that I can pop/push new pairs?
[04:06:50] <GoSox> jQuery does have "something" to solve "a problem"
[04:07:06] <OnkelTem> from MDN I came to this library: https://github.com/sid0/jsdict
[04:07:13] <OnkelTem> Actually, I'm trying to emulate call stack where keys are function names and values - their bodies
[04:08:27] <OnkelTem> GoSox: that is true!
[04:08:38] <OnkelTem> While in this case I have specific problem :)
[04:16:52] <vinky> Lost123, hm, I get a syntax error in jquery-ui when look at that
[04:31:09] <iRc123> Will this: $(this).closest('p').slideToggle("slow"); find the closest <p> from my this?
[04:31:37] <iRc123> and slide it*? :)
[04:37:04] <iRc123> ? :(
[04:37:05] <bot-t> :(
[04:40:50] <dabear> iRc123: yup, unless this also is a p element
[04:41:18] <dabear> in which case that's the element that will be slide()-ed
[04:46:30] <JenniferB2> does scripts included in the head load async or sync ?
[04:46:39] <iRc123> dabear: http://gyazo.com/a7d04fb16add82029ff0bfe6ee45916d, Any idea why that one won't work? :/
[04:46:57] <sunbeam> how can i find out which function is called when i submit a certain form?
[04:50:30] <dabear> sunbeam: $._data($("#someform")[0], "events")
[04:54:42] <sunbeam> dabear: I'm using a form plugin in WP called Contactform7. When the form has been submit, I would like to make sure that info is filled in correctly
[04:55:03] <sunbeam> dabear: so besides the javascript code that is delivered with this plugin, that basically handles the submit function
[04:55:17] <sunbeam> at the same submit i would also like to execute my own code IF the form is successfully checked
[04:56:44] <dabear> ok, don't know how that form  plugin works
[04:56:59] <iRc123> sunbeam get some values from the inputs
[04:56:59] <dabear> usually when a form is validated, it's submitted afterwards
[04:57:02] <iRc123> and check them
[04:57:03] <iRc123> ?
[04:57:04] <dabear> meaning a new page is loaded
[04:58:05] <sunbeam> dabear: yea?
[04:58:06] <sunbeam> ok
[04:58:25] <iRc123> What is it that you want to do exactly?
[04:58:27] <dabear> meaning your form is lost
[04:58:32] <sunbeam> $(".wpcf7-form").submit(function() { return false; }
[04:58:37] <sunbeam> this does nothing (no checking)
[05:01:09] <sunbeam> Anyway what I want to achieve
[05:01:15] <sunbeam> is add code after submitting
[05:01:19] <sunbeam> and I cannot edit the plugin files
[05:02:14] <iRc123> sunbeam: http://gyazo.com/44f1c06e8b53a9d7fc96b1f717ea6f7d
[05:02:16] <iRc123> ?
[05:03:04] <sunbeam> Contactform7 uses ajax
[05:04:26] <dabear> sunbeam: you can add an additional submit handler. you can also register a handler on the document to get any ajax posted by the plugin
[05:04:35] <dabear> $(document).ajaxComplete(function(){ ....}
[05:05:56] <sunbeam> sec
[05:10:13] <sunbeam> dabear: you're right, great thhnx
[05:21:56] <sunbeam> is this is the best way?
[05:23:38] <gaurav21r> Hi
[05:24:24] <iRc123> http://gyazo.com/a7d04fb16add82029ff0bfe6ee45916d, Any idea why this won't work? :/
[05:24:43] <gaurav21r> Im new to IRC
[05:26:50] <vinky> iRc123, what won't work?
[05:29:26] <iRc123> vinky: <p class="secretDiv"> - which is the closest and only <p> after (this) - won't slide
[05:29:58] <vinky> are those lines called?
[05:32:32] <iRc123> What do you mean?
[05:32:44] <vinky> are they executed?
[05:34:19] <sahbeewah> iRc123, your logic is not sound
[05:34:59] <iRc123> All I want to do is click .double_arrow_down and slideToggle the closest <p class="secretDiv">
[05:35:38] <iRc123> The code that I provided in the gyazo above was me attempting to do just that. It didn't work out ;P
[05:36:09] <sahbeewah> firstly, .closest() doesn't get the "closest" element, it gets the closest ancestor element
[05:36:51] <sahbeewah> also, the handler will only affect elements that have .double_arrow_down as an initial state, and never .double_arrow_up
[05:38:13] <sahbeewah> if it's "after" your element, you're probably after .next(), or nextAll(), or .siblings()
[05:45:15] <iRc123> sahbeewah, quick question.
[05:45:19] <iRc123> This worked: $(this).nextUntil('secretDiv').slideDown("slow");
[05:45:28] <iRc123> Why did I have to use nextUntil instead of next?
[05:45:41] <dabear> next only returns the immediate next sibling
[05:46:24] <dabear> that is, 0 or 1 elements will be returned bt next
[05:46:39] <dabear> by*
[05:47:07] <iRc123> what is the point of filling an argument into next e.g next(.selected) if it returns the immediate sibling?
[05:47:44] <dabear> iRc123: the argument is a filter
[05:48:11] <dabear> e.g. if it doesn't match the filter, the jquery object returned will have 0 elements
[05:48:25] <iRc123> ah
[05:48:53] <iRc123> My code feels sloppy, but it will have to do haha :)
[05:57:59] <dabear> iRc123: I guess you could create your own nextFirstMatch() method or something:p
[06:03:03] <obenns> Has anyone had issues before with .offset() and Mac?

[07:42:03] <Vasa> does jquery load itself asynchnously? as if when I just add at this exact moment the library into a page, are there any settimeout or intervals within that load more code?
[07:42:54] <Vasa> for instance when I am trying to add jquery into a page from within firebug, the code right afterward the library doesn't work unless i run it twice
[07:43:09] <dabear> Vasa: it loads it self completely. however, be aware that the dom might not be ready when jquery is loaded, that's why we have doc ready ..
[07:43:36] <Vasa> dabear then why those icidents happend
[07:43:46] <Vasa> as if it is not loaded instantly
[07:44:30] <dabear> jquery is loaded instantly
[07:44:50] <Vasa> so many weird behaviors nobody knows the answer to :P
[07:46:02] <dabear> maybe your code is weird:p
[07:48:53] <Vasa> hahahaha you might be right but how can my code be related to external libraries that just don't load right :P
[08:07:26] <jop008> this is my table        <table data-role="table" id="booking_data" data-mode="reflow" class="ui-responsive table-stroke" >
[08:07:36] <jop008> I don't want it 100% width
[08:07:57] <jop008> how to specify the width of a table?
[08:08:19] <jop008> jquery mobile
[08:11:36] <Vasa> jop008 I think the width of a table is affected by the elements within
[08:11:46] <Vasa> jop008 try to specify the width of the elements within
[08:11:54] <jop008> okay
[08:12:19] <jop008> specifying width with em;
[08:17:58] <jop008> specifying elements doesn't help
[08:19:27] <dabear> on mobile, you generally don't want many elements cramped up together, havinh a table with 100% width should be ok there..
[09:11:48] <sunbeam> dabear: here still?
[09:16:03] <fesener_> would someone please tell me whats wrong with this little code? http://pastebin.com/mekTKihf

[09:16:30] <sunbeam> how can i check if a form has just been submit (by another function in another script file) ?
[09:20:16] <fesener_> nvm -.- i just realized i've typed .html instead of .html()

[11:03:53] <mink> Hi guys. Maybe someone know where I can find boilerplate or tutorial how create plugins, with executions working like that >  $( '#elem' ).pluginName( 'pluginFunction' );    ?
[11:36:24] <JenniferB2> is html attribute names and values case insensitive nowadays ??
[11:50:40] <optiqal> @JenniferB2 - I believe they are
[11:54:20] <lanoxx> hi there, I have created an accordion menu using jquery which opens the submenus when i hover over the entry using mouseover and mouseleave callbacks
[11:54:54] <lanoxx> my problem is, when i move the mouse very quickly then the callback is triggered multiple times causing the submenu to begin swinging
[11:55:03] <danyd> hi
[11:55:19] <lanoxx> it quickly opens and closes multiple times
[11:55:42] <lanoxx> im wondering if there is any way to block the callback from getting queued until the animation is finished
[11:57:12] <ClamShell> lanoxx: I usually set a global var to toggle true and false when I have an action that's in progress, and I just use it to check in an if to break
[11:57:30] <optiqal> @lanoxx - Do you have a link?  You probably need to stop() the animation when you hover over another element.
[11:57:53] <lanoxx> unfortunately im testing on my local computer, but i can post a pase
[11:57:58] <lanoxx> hang on
[11:58:40] <lanoxx> http://pastebin.com/j3TuwVHF
[12:02:40] <lanoxx> http://pastebin.com/dJunkXbY  <--- with jQuery syntax enabled
[12:02:51] <lanoxx> optiqal, ^
[12:04:25] <optiqal> @lanoxx  - Sorry, I was afk.  Looking at it now
[12:06:46] <optiqal> Try changing the function to this
[12:06:47] <optiqal> function openSubMenu() {
[12:06:47] <optiqal>     $(this).next("ul").children("li").stop()
[12:06:47] <optiqal>     $(this).next("ul").children("li").slideDown("fast");
[12:06:47] <optiqal> }
[12:06:52] <optiqal> And see if that fixes it
[12:10:53] <lanoxx> optiqal, yes, that is much better
[12:11:09] <optiqal> @lanoxx - Great.  Glad it worked
[12:12:08] <lanoxx> optiqal, is is possible to add a small delay, so that the submenu only opens when the mouse hover stays there for more than 50ms or so
[12:13:32] <optiqal> $(this).next("ul").children("li").delay(400).slideDown("fast");
[12:13:49] <optiqal> maybe?  I think that will work
[12:18:38] <optiqal> @lanoxx - Did that work?
[12:18:52] <lanoxx> optiqal, im still experimenting a bit, but in generall yes
[12:19:11] <lanoxx> i have ended up with:
[12:19:12] <lanoxx>     $(this).next("ul").children("li").stop(true);
[12:19:12] <lanoxx>     $(this).next("ul").children("li").delay(600).slideDown(100);
[12:19:31] <lanoxx> and the same for closing
[12:20:48] <LUDIJAK> Hello doing $('div.time').html("<ol id=\"selectable\"><li class=\"ui-widget-content\">TEST</li></ol>"); Creates button but it's not clickable or have any controls, events? Any idea why?
[12:21:19] <lanoxx> optiqal, i think passing true to stop in combination with a small delay did the trick, so if i move the mouse around quickly the menu doenst come out immediately
[12:33:04] <boo> Any ideas why rm_callback is not handled properly on a ios device? https://github.com/thomassturm/ender-postmessage/blob/master/ender-postmessage.js

[13:14:30] <sunbeam> I need to manually submit a form with jquery, for this form I've got some HTML code
[13:14:46] <sunbeam> any ideas how I best do this?  I think the form name etc also have to correspond
[13:16:05] <mink> sunbeam, $("form").submit();   ?
[13:16:44] <sunbeam> mink: but i need to add the <form> with javascript aswell
[13:16:51] <sunbeam> mink: and it doesn't even need to be visible
[13:20:33] <mink> sunbeam,    $("<form></form>").appendTo("body");      $("form").submit();
[13:20:42] <mink> sunbeam, what you exactly want do?
[13:31:04] <sunbeam> mink: i've got a form, with some data, that i should also submit to another action
[13:31:09] <sunbeam> (with 3 hidden fields)
[13:36:44] <sunbeam> i've did it like you said now
[13:36:48] <sunbeam> probably not the best solution
[13:36:57] <sunbeam> can't think of a better way
[14:00:34] <cameron262> How could I arrange elements on a page by % coordinates but then rearange them automatically so that there's no overlap?

[15:25:50] <d4rklit3> hi
[15:25:56] <dabear> yo
[15:26:06] <d4rklit3> can anyone help me out with jcarousel? im trying to run carousel.next()/prev() but nothing is happening
[15:26:38] <dabear> d4rklit3: is there any errors in the console?
[15:26:47] <dabear> is/are
[15:26:59] <d4rklit3> none
[15:27:03] <d4rklit3> when i run it through console
[15:27:05] <d4rklit3> it just returns undefined
[15:27:06] <lol91> http://filepdf.tk/copy/test.php sorry for bad english. this dont work when i click first time, but later works. Can someone help me?
[15:27:27] <dabear> d4rklit3: jsfiddle it
[15:27:38] <d4rklit3> well
[15:28:01] <d4rklit3> thats difficult
[15:28:14] <dabear> create a reduced test case and post it on jsfiddle
[15:28:15] <d4rklit3> given the context
[15:28:21] <d4rklit3> alright
[15:28:21] <d4rklit3> lol
[15:28:28] <dabear> ?reduce @ d4rklit3
[15:28:29] <bot-t> d4rklit3, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[15:28:45] <d4rklit3> yeah you're prob right
[15:31:20] <d4rklit3> aah now i remember
[15:31:31] <d4rklit3> im assigning the events before the carousel inits
[15:33:57] <d4rklit3> actually didn't fix
[15:33:57] <d4rklit3> hmm
[15:47:15] <d4rklit3> ok so still doesnt work
[15:47:15] <d4rklit3> http://jsfiddle.net/mYGSY/
[15:47:37] <d4rklit3> crap jsfiddle brok it
[15:48:51] <d4rklit3> not really loading the plugin
[15:50:55] <zapsoda> If i have a button that runs a AJAX query that updates a database column for each of the selected rows on the page, Would it be better to make a javascript foreach loop that does "UPDATE `order_detail` SET `order_status`=[value-13] WHERE `order_id`=[The_order_ID_of_the_selected_row]" or should i have one query that does "UPDATE `order_detail` SET `order_status`=[value-13] WHERE `order_id`=[The_order_ID_o
[15:50:58] <dabear> d4rklit3: use the external resources on the left hand side
[15:51:03] <d4rklit3> i dont think i know how to get plugins into jsfiddle
[15:51:04] <zapsoda> f_the_first_row] OR `order_id`=[The_order_ID_of_the_second_row] OR `order_id`=[The_order_ID_of_the_third_row]....."?
[15:51:52] <d4rklit3> http://jsfiddle.net/uLhTr/ what am i doing wrong here?
[15:52:08] <d4rklit3> i even put jquery in the ext resouces to make sure it loads first
[15:52:10] <dabear> zapsoda: make one sql statement, but use WHERE order_id IN (2,5,22,55)
[15:52:30] <dabear> those values are obviously bogus, but you get the ide
[15:52:32] <dabear> idea
[15:52:37] <zapsoda> Thanks dabear
[15:52:38] <dabear> no OR-ing :)
[15:52:53] <zapsoda> I was hoping there was a better way lol
[15:53:04] <dabear> hm
[15:53:06] <dabear> wait
[15:53:15] <dabear> javascript generates the sql?
[15:53:39] <dabear> client side generation of sql code that is run on the server?
[15:53:40] <dabear> lol
[15:53:42] <zapsoda> Javascript will pass the select row ids to the ajax page that will gen the list
[15:54:18] <dabear> ok, as long as the js code doesn't generate any sql on its own :)
[15:54:40] <d4rklit3> dabear, jsfiddle wont pick jcarousel from the ext resources
[15:54:58] <zapsoda> Kk, Thanks dabear
[15:55:09] <d4rklit3> or something like that, like it doesn't detect jquery
[15:56:56] <d4rklit3> jsfiddle loads t he plugin before jquery
[15:56:59] <d4rklit3> come on
[15:57:45] <d4rklit3> seriously wtf
[15:58:11] <dabear> d4rklit3: you got to load both jcarousel AND jcarouselAutoscroll
[15:58:16] <d4rklit3> oooo
[15:58:18] <d4rklit3> lol wtf
[15:58:29] <dabear> http://fiddle.jshell.net/mYGSY/6/show/
[15:58:43] <dabear> view the source, should be easy to see
[15:58:53] <d4rklit3> ok
[15:59:01] <d4rklit3> not terribly familiar with al lthe jcarousel plugs
[15:59:16] <d4rklit3> anywyas, http://jsfiddle.net/LYnFc/
[15:59:17] <d4rklit3> this doesnt work
[15:59:21] <dabear> never used it my self
[16:02:39] <d4rklit3> lol seriously... this is annoying like im using the wrong lib
[16:04:53] <d4rklit3> ok i recreated my example but only using the jcarousel version i have locally
[16:06:24] <d4rklit3> ok here it is:  http://jsfiddle.net/WM7QJ/       all events are firing as they should but the carousel doesn't move. I would really appreciate any help here.
[16:12:02] <dabear> d4rklit3: did you try to compare with http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/static_vertical.html
[16:12:07] <dabear> which seems to work
[16:12:17] <xor_mind-> how can I fill out an input type='number' with an array of numbers?
[16:12:47] <d4rklit3> yeah iom doing that now
[16:12:50] <d4rklit3> i cant see what im doing differently
[16:13:15] <d4rklit3> my ul has same styles
[16:14:07] <d4rklit3> they are using a custom skin
[16:14:12] <d4rklit3> thats the only difference
[16:14:14] <d4rklit3> i dont want that
[16:14:17] <dabear> xor_mind-: that's kinda vague
[16:14:31] <d4rklit3> like inspecting the dom, it lokos like it should be chaning the top property
[16:14:40] <dabear> what specifically is the problem, xor_mind-
[16:15:46] <xor_mind-> dabear: <input type="number" name="numberPicker"/> and I have an array of numbers = [2,3,5,7,11..] I want to add those and only those numbers to my numberPicker input.
[16:16:14] <dabear> yep, and using val() is not an option?
[16:16:30] <dabear> or is numberpicker a plugin or whatever
[16:16:44] <d4rklit3> do i have to use a skin?
[16:17:16] <dabear> d4rklit3: probably not
[16:17:43] <xor_mind-> dabear: I'm a jquery noob, I didn't know val will append numbers to the list, i thought it would just set the current entry
[16:18:03] <dabear> xor_mind-: yeah, it will
[16:18:20] <dabear> it will set the current entry, that is
[16:18:41] <dabear> .val(foo.val()+"2,3") will append
[16:19:10] <xor_mind-> ty dabera, i'll get that code to work
[16:19:12] <xor_mind-> err dabear
[16:19:34] <tw2113> dabeer?
[16:19:35] <dabear> xor_mind-: tab completion, IRCs best friend
[16:19:42] <dabear> tw2113: old joke
[16:19:49] <dabear> :)
[16:19:56] <tw2113> SNL?
[16:19:59] <tw2113> da bears!
[16:20:14] <dabear> snl?
[16:20:19] <dabear> that show in the us?
[16:20:36] <tw2113> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=769A4mUY7g0
[16:22:22] <dabear> tw2113: yeah, that's not actually any funny at all. I just don't get it.. strange sense of humor
[16:22:35] <dabear> I loved d*ck in a box, though :9
[16:22:47] <tw2113> different styles for different people
[16:22:55] <tw2113> probably helps to be from Chicago too for this
[16:23:10] <dabear> <-different continent
[16:23:32] <tw2113> i like improv
[16:26:13] <d4rklit3> dabear, im going to seriosly give jcarousel auther a piece of my mind
[16:26:18] <d4rklit3> he doesnt include any base classes
[16:26:38] <tw2113> does it need to?
[16:26:41] <dabear> just copy that working example I gave you?
[16:26:55] <dabear> and then change it to suit your needs
[16:26:55] <d4rklit3> i got it to work
[16:27:06] <d4rklit3> did you add jcarousel specific classes?
[16:27:32] <dabear> that example was from googling
[16:27:34] <dabear> not mine
[16:27:45] <dabear> not my code :)
[16:47:51] <d4rklit3> hey
[16:48:05] <d4rklit3> is there somethign with jquery 1.10 where the jQuery object isn't present
[16:48:11] <d4rklit3> i haev $ but not jQuery
[16:50:39] <CWSpear> is $ actually jQuery, d4rklit3?
[16:50:44] <d4rklit3> yep
[16:50:47] <d4rklit3> should be same thing
[16:50:59] <CWSpear> And it's possible somewhere else could have set window.jQuery = undefined
[16:51:14] <d4rklit3> why in gods name would anyone do such thing?
[16:51:15] <CWSpear> I mean, $ could by prototype or another library
[16:51:22] <CWSpear> to mess with you
[16:51:26] <d4rklit3> haha
[16:51:30] <d4rklit3> there are several devs on this
[16:51:33] <d4rklit3> who im managing
[16:51:36] <d4rklit3> i will stake the one who did that
[16:51:39] <d4rklit3> if thats the case
[16:51:44] <CWSpear> heh
[16:52:13] <CWSpear> did you confirm in the console tho… something that's only jQuery-y? to make sure it's not prototype and jQuery isn't loaded at all?
[16:52:34] <d4rklit3> jquery is loaded cuz $ exists
[16:52:56] <d4rklit3> things using $ work
[16:53:23] <CWSpear> ok. I was just saying that other libraries use $
[16:53:36] <d4rklit3> i believe boostrap is here?
[16:54:02] <CWSpear> Bootstrap uses jQuery
[16:54:14] <CWSpear> My best guess is that it got unset somewhere
[16:54:30] <CWSpear> But I don't know of a good reason to do that on purpose
[16:54:48] <d4rklit3> not sure
[16:54:53] <d4rklit3> we are using grunt to build all our stuff
[16:55:44] <CWSpear> are you using RequireJS?
[16:56:04] <LaMakina> d4rklit3: as CWSpear said, it could be another lib. you can check it for yourself  ==>>  jQuery().jquery;  or $().jquery;  to check the version.
[16:56:26] <d4rklit3> ok i think im somewhere now
[16:56:34] <d4rklit3> i was loading this jCarouselSwipe
[16:56:36] <d4rklit3> and it was breaking
[17:00:20] <d4rklit3> https://github.com/felquis/jCarouselSwipe this is breaking it
[17:01:21] <CWSpear> it is version .1 and has several dependecies: jQuery, jCarousel, Modernizr, Hammer and jQuery Boilerplate
[17:01:28] <CWSpear> er
[17:01:43] <CWSpear> I'm not sure they are dependencies. it's kind of confusing
[17:02:07] <d4rklit3> yeah
[17:02:14] <d4rklit3> required plugins doesnt mention jquery boilerplate
[17:02:16] <CWSpear> oh yeah, it needs jCarousel, Hammer.js and modernnizr with touch check
[17:02:17] <d4rklit3> the authors do
[17:02:18] <d4rklit3> wtf
[17:02:24] <d4rklit3> i haev all these
[17:04:39] <d4rklit3> too many problems
[18:02:52] <Cameron> How could I arrange elements on a page by % coordinates but then rearange them automatically so that there's no overlap?
[18:09:41] <whallz> is there a quick way to unbind all click events from all elements in the dom?
[18:11:29] <Gazpacho> $('*').off('click')
[18:13:12] <wfpkhc> Hello - can anyone recommend any good books for learning jquery effects please?
[18:16:00] <wfpkhc> perhaps not :(
[18:18:06] <wfpkhc> ill be back later
[18:21:32] <whallz> Gazpacho: is that the best way to do that isnt that very consuming?
[18:21:57] <Gazpacho> consuming what?
[18:21:57] <whallz> isnt there like a list of all binds in jquery?
[18:22:05] <whallz> i mean bad performance
[18:22:19] <whallz> $('*') seems slow
[18:22:45] <Gazpacho> i'd suggest that you try it before assuming so
[18:23:19] <whallz> Gazpacho: im not assuming, im just saying that selector will go through each element and unbind the click event
[18:23:39] <whallz> im asking if theres an object within jquery which stores binded elements
[18:23:41] <Gazpacho> you're assuming that will be slow
[18:23:41] <whallz> or something like that
[18:23:52] <whallz> how can it not be slow?
[18:24:13] <Gazpacho> I'm not going to argue about it
[18:24:28] <whallz> im not looking for an argument either
[18:24:39] <whallz> i just want to find the best and most performant way to do it
[18:24:49] <whallz> anyway, ill try that, thanks for your help
[18:27:00] <whallz> anyone has another solution?
[18:27:39] <whallz> i want to access all dom elements that have a click event binded, and unbind them
[18:29:11] <shoky> whallz are you binding them yourself?
[18:29:21] <whallz> shoky: yup
[18:30:06] <whallz> does jquery store a list of binded elements or something like that?
[18:30:07] <whallz> or should i do it?
[18:30:29] <whallz> id like to avoid doing something like $('*').off('click')
[18:31:03] <shoky> jquery doesn't store such a list afaik. i think the best way is to either store a list of them yourself, or add a class to each of them and then select by class
[18:31:26] <chase> trying to use delegated events on an a tag $("a").on('click', '.class', … but it doesn't fire when the a tag with .class is clicked - any ideas?
[18:31:46] <shoky> chase: $("a").on
[18:31:55] <shoky> chase: $("a").on  binds an event handler to EACH <a>
[18:32:01] <chase> shoky: I know
[18:32:19] <chase> shoky: its actually $(".parent_class a") ...
[18:32:46] <shoky> you have an <a class="class"> inside an <a> ?
[18:33:18] <shoky> just asking cause you said "the a tag with .class"
[18:33:40] <shoky> `demo @ chase
[18:33:40] <b-ot> chase: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:34:05] <chase> I have a <div class="parent-class"><a href="" class=".replies"></a></div> and the jquery is $(".parent-class a").on("click", ".replies", ...
[18:34:16] <shoky> that's not how event delegation works
[18:34:29] <shoky> you delegate to an ancestor non-dynamic element
[18:34:40] <chase> yea
[18:34:44] <shoky> e.g.  $(".parent-class").on("click", "a.replies", ... )
[18:34:48] <chase> ah
[18:34:52] <shoky> assuming .parent-class is static
[18:34:56] <chase> it is
[18:35:22] <chase> huh
[18:35:42] <chase> let me re-read the .on api page
[18:35:51] <chase> i'll also try moving the a
[18:36:00] <shoky> no need to move it
[18:36:46] <chase> i mean move it in the jqueyr
[18:37:18] <shoky> $(".parent-class").on("click", ".replies", ... )  should work too
[18:37:49] <chase> true
[18:37:56] <chase> i get it now
[18:37:59] <Emy2> I'm making a userscript and getting the html from another webpage using an xml http request. How can I then use jQuery on that received html? I dunno if that makes sense, I'm still very new at this
[18:38:06] <chase> thanks for clarifying how it works
[18:38:59] <chase> now that that is working - would i have to manually do a 'toggle' functionality on a dynamic element using a data attribute?
[18:39:35] <shoky> you mean instead of using .toggle ?
[18:39:47] <shoky> yeah. don't use an attribute though, use .data()
[18:40:04] <chase> yes using .toggle
[18:40:09] <d4rklit3> would it be safe to say if my devs didn't use box-sizing for this responsive site that they fucked it up big time?
[18:40:11] <shoky> or well, a class could work fine too
[18:40:17] <chase> true
[18:40:18] <shoky> if it helps with the styling
[18:40:28] <chase> think data might be more appropriate here
[18:40:31] <chase> thanks man
[18:48:37] <shoky> Emy2: you could try  var dom = $.parseHTML( htmlString ), jqDom = $(dom);  but if it's a full html you might get some unexpected results
[18:52:41] <aartist> ,
[18:52:48] <aartist> ,help
[18:52:49] <b-ot> aartist: NO U!
[18:52:51] <Emy2> yeah, it's a full HTML I'm trying to parse
[18:52:57] <Moataz-E> hello everyone
[18:53:13] <nesoi> I'm writing an phonegap/jqm app which does some messaging. What's the best way to trigger some kind of update when a message is successfully sent? I want to change some indicator on the screen without refreshing the whole screen. The issue is that the data may or may not be displayed at any moment.
[18:53:24] <Emy2> shoky: yeah, it's a full HTML I'm trying to parse
[18:53:25] <Moataz-E> i'm having an issue with some form fields i am trying to hide/show depending on the value of a select field
[18:53:30] <Moataz-E> here is the code: http://pastebin.com/Pwbg4EQH
[18:53:31] <aartist> I am looking for a good sidebar with vertical dropdown. where I can find out?
[18:53:37] <nesoi> so I need some way to trigger updating that field, but the field may not be present at that moment
[18:53:41] <nesoi> what's a good way to do that?
[18:54:27] <Moataz-E> i am a total javascript noob by the way :(
[18:58:04] <Moataz-E> basically, i want to show fields with class "individual-option" and hide the ones with class "cooperate-option" when the select field has the option with value individual selected
[18:59:50] <shoky> Emy2: well read the docs for $() and know that it's the browser doing the actual parsing, and it can omit some tags like <html> and <body>
[19:01:05] <arcenierin> Evening...
[19:01:09] <Emy2> shoky: I particularly want to use jquery so I can do this: $('tr:contains("Last Post:")')  would it be possible to do that sort of parsing with .parseHTML?
[19:02:07] <shoky> Emy2: yeah probably.  $( $.parseHTML( htmlString ) ).find('tr:contains("Last Post:")')
[19:02:41] <Emy2> shoky: thanks a ton, I'll report back shortly with my results
[19:05:12] <Moataz-E> anyone has any feedback on why my simple js code isn't working?
[19:05:56] <shoky> Moataz-E: is that in a DOM ready callback? or at the end of <body> ?
[19:06:28] <shoky> Moataz-E: btw no need for $(":selected", this).val();   just use this.value
[19:07:25] <Moataz-E> shoky: it is at the end of <head>, i moved it to the end of <body> and still not working
[19:07:49] <shoky> `demo @ Moataz-E
[19:07:49] <b-ot> Moataz-E: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:08:15] <Moataz-E> shoky: will do it right now
[19:12:37] <Emy2> shoky: I'm getting Uncaught TypeError: Object function ( selector, context ) { 	// The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced' 	return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context ); } has no method 'parseHTML'  :/
[19:12:50] <Moataz-E> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/ApyUB/
[19:17:02] <Emy2> shoky: could I use noConflict() to release jQuery from the document and then .ready() it to the new HTML?
[19:24:14] <shoky> Emy2: you can use a newer jquery
[19:24:54] <shoky> Moataz-E: check your console
[19:25:17] <shoky> (after changing the select)
[19:41:54] <nesoi> anyone here use jqm? I'm having an issue where I tap on a button, the button has a function which does a mobile.changePage, and the pagechange event is never executed on the new page
[19:43:39] <Emy2> shoky: I feel so dumb, I never realized that I was using an incredibly outdated version of jQuery :( Thanks for your help, it works perfectly
[19:50:52] <nesoi> is it ok to have two different .on('pagechange') functions, or should I have only one?
[19:52:39] <Moataz-E> shoky: i get a "Empty string passed to getElementById()
[19:59:51] <Moataz-E> shoky: oh my god! can't believe this. so sorry i wasted your time
[20:12:30] <adamsilver> what is wrong with this: $("#username").closest(":button").addClass("disabled"); … the class is not being added
[20:13:51] <CWSpear> is :button valid?
[20:13:56] <CWSpear> I don't think I've seen that
[20:14:17] <CWSpear> apparently it is
[20:14:53] <adamsilver> yes, this is working: $(":button").addClass("disabled");
[20:15:13] <adamsilver> but i want to disable to closest only
[20:15:16] <CWSpear> adamsilver, what's the markup? is #username a child of your button?
[20:15:24] <CWSpear> closest finds the closest parent
[20:16:01] <CWSpear> `api closest @adamsilver
[20:16:01] <b-ot> adamsilver: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[20:16:44] <adamsilver> CWSpear: <div id="username">..</div><div class="control-group"><button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">...</button></div>
[20:17:03] <CWSpear> yeah, you're not using closest right
[20:17:28] <adamsilver> CWSpear: what should i use in this case?
[20:17:37] <CWSpear> You'd want something like $('#username').next('control-group').find(':button').addClass...
[20:18:23] <CWSpear> it depends on what you want to accomplish
[20:18:28] <CWSpear> but that is the most direct route
[20:18:43] <CWSpear> whoops, I had a type
[20:18:55] <CWSpear> .next('.control-group') <— forgot a period there, adamsilver
[20:19:52] <adamsilver> CWSpear: that worked, thanks a lot
[20:19:56] <CWSpear> but like I said… depending on what you're trying to do, you might just want to add a class to the button, like "username-button" and use $('.username-button').addClass('disabled');
[20:19:59] <CWSpear> No problem
[20:32:07] <nesoi> why would the pagechange event not get executed?
[20:38:42] <CWSpear> nesoi, because it failed?
[20:39:08] <CWSpear> there is a pagechangefailed
[20:39:55] <maxime-2> Hi all !
[20:45:30] <nesoi> CWSpear:  it actually changes to the requested page, but the pagechange event isn't triggered
[20:46:06] <CWSpear> is it refreshing the page, or ajaxing in new content or whatever?
[20:46:07] <Fire-Dragon-DoL> Anyone can help me with Load Remote data with Select2? I think I'm following correctly the API directions but keeps showing the load indicator (but the request is correctly sent and response received)
[20:47:01] <nesoi> CWSpear:  it's a phonegap app, so it's supposed to go to that page, then the pagechange event will refresh the page with new data
[20:47:18] <nesoi> it used to work, but now isn't working, no idea why
[20:48:01] <CWSpear> do you have a URL?
[20:48:15] <nesoi> CWSpear:  it's a phonegap app
[20:48:22] <nesoi> it's local on my phone
[20:49:08] <CWSpear> are you not testing anything in the browser or anything? can you open up the safari console and confirm that it's actually triggering a jqm page change, or is it creating a completely new request?
[20:51:50] <nesoi> CWSpear:  it would take a lot to get this working in a browser. It's using all kinds of phone data.
[20:53:27] <CWSpear> the only reason I can think of it not triggering is cuz of an error at some point in the process
[20:53:47] <darkpassenger> is there anyway i can loop over input elements insides a specific div ?
[20:53:51] <darkpassenger> in jquery %
[20:54:32] <nesoi> how would I debug that CWSpear?
[20:54:58] <CWSpear> darkpassenger, Dexter reference?
[20:55:01] <darkpassenger> yea
[20:55:10] <CWSpear> nesoi, what kind of phone do you have?
[20:55:33] <darkpassenger> CWSpear: but im stuck in the 7th season because I really can't deal with the computer guy :P
[20:55:33] <nesoi> android 4.1.1
[20:55:45] <CWSpear> darkpassenger, $('.div-selector').find('input').each(function() { console.log($(this)); });
[20:55:59] <CWSpear> I just got caught up with the first two episodes of this season
[20:56:00] <CWSpear> today
[20:56:05] <darkpassenger> thanks ill give it a shot !
[20:56:12] <darkpassenger> CWSpear: season 8 , is it ?
[20:56:17] <CWSpear> I think so?
[20:56:22] <darkpassenger> dont spoil bro :P
[20:56:29] <CWSpear> I won't
[20:56:39] <CWSpear> nesoi, Android is a lot harder to test
[20:57:01] <CWSpear> The only way I've been able to test is with http://debug.phonegap.com/, which seems to be down right now
[20:58:51] <CWSpear> nesoi, if it were up, it'd get you set up with weinre (source: https://github.com/apache/cordova-weinre). That sets up a remote debugger and you can check for errors
[20:59:11] <CWSpear> it's pretty slow tho. You can set up a local version of weinre. All a lot of work.
[20:59:25] <CWSpear> Android debugging sucks. That's the best I've been able to find.
[21:00:13] <nesoi> would that actually show anything though?
[21:00:20] <nesoi> what could I see?
[21:00:23] <CWSpear> it would show JavaScript errors
[21:00:41] <nesoi> I think I see those in the logcat anyway though
[21:00:44] <CWSpear> and it has a console
[21:00:47] <nesoi> or am I not seeing all of them?
[21:01:24] <CWSpear> Yes, there is log cat, I did forget about that. But it's hard to interact with, can only output strings and you'll have to set up good filters to make it usable
[21:01:36] <CWSpear> and it's not interactive
[21:01:42] <CWSpear> with weinre, you can interact with the console
[21:01:58] <nesoi> I'm not seeing any javascript errors in logcat
[21:02:25] <CWSpear> sorry, I don't have any other ideas without being able to look at it
[21:02:45] <CWSpear> See if you can make a reduced test case?
[21:05:18] <CWSpear> `reduce @nesoi
[21:05:25] <CWSpear> Dang you bot
[21:05:42] <CWSpear> `english
[21:05:59] <nesoi> seems like it would take hours to make a reduced test case...
[21:06:05] <nesoi> but maybe it would be worth it
[21:06:12] <nesoi> otoh, if the reduced case works, I'm left with no data
[21:06:22] <darkpassenger> is there a way to add the content of a string as the name of an object property ?
[21:07:11] <shoky> obj[str]='hi'
[21:08:55] <CWSpear> nesoi, that may not be the best solution, but I don't have any more ideas
[21:09:43] <nesoi> CWSpear:  any tips on creating a minimal test case?
[21:10:19] <CWSpear> create a page with a few links that change via JQM and see if you can break it by reproducing how the current version navigates
[21:10:45] <nesoi> the current version navigates all via javascript tap events
[21:12:32] <CWSpear> nesoi, does all the other jQueryMobile stuff work?
[21:18:35] <darkpassenger> thanks shoky
[21:18:51] <darkpassenger> i do have a ton of question
[21:18:52] <darkpassenger> :p
[21:18:57] <darkpassenger> haha
[21:21:35] <nesoi> CWSpear:  yeah, everything else is working.
[21:22:04] <CWSpear> so just the event isn't firing?
[21:22:08] <nesoi> yeah
[21:22:32] <CWSpear> I got nothing
[21:24:03] <nesoi> :(
[21:25:07] <nesoi> is there any way to manually fire the event?
[21:25:38] <nesoi> like do window.location.href="whatever"; event.pagechange.fire() or something?
[21:25:48] <CWSpear> $.mobile.changePage('/path/');
[21:26:17] <nesoi> in this case $.mobile.changePage("#message-page");
[21:26:34] <CWSpear> yeah
[21:26:40] <CWSpear> if that's a data-page
[21:26:50] <nesoi> I also did window.location.href = "#message-page"; and that worked a bit, but then stopped working too
[21:27:01] <CWSpear> maybe it's caching the page
[21:27:21] <nesoi> I tried {reloadPage: true} and it reloaded my entire app
[21:27:25] <CWSpear> and thus not triggering it
[21:27:30] <nesoi> which did not work
[21:27:54] <nesoi> thing is, it used to work fine
[21:28:00] <nesoi> it's not new code
[21:30:09] <CWSpear> weird
[21:30:31] <nesoi> I do have two $(document).on('pagechange', function(event) { in different js files
[21:30:36] <nesoi> but that wasn't a problem
[21:32:08] <nesoi> before…
[21:32:35] <nesoi> I wonder if it's a bad idea though. The syntax is odd. It's
[21:32:36] <nesoi> $(document).on('pagechange', function(event)
[21:32:49] <darkpassenger> :p
[21:32:55] <nesoi> but should really be $(document).on('pagechange', 'pagename', function(event)
[21:33:11] <nesoi> to be in compliance with other .on statements
[21:35:15] <CWSpear> does pagebeforechange or pagechangefailed get fired?
[21:51:28] <nesoi> hmm. that may have fixed it
[21:52:49] <CWSpear> what did you do, nesoi?
[21:53:55] <nesoi> but now something else is broken
[21:54:28] <nesoi> I had 3 different places where there was $(document).on('pagechange', function(event) {
[21:54:42] <nesoi> so I combined them into one and put them in the first javascript file to be loaded
[21:54:53] <nesoi> now that's getting fired, but my pageinit isn't!
[21:55:12] <darkpassenger> How do I add an array to an object (as a property of this object)
[21:55:15] <nesoi> wtf?
[21:55:29] <darkpassenger> maybe i asked in the wrong chan..
[21:56:04] <nesoi> object.array = array;
[21:56:31] <nesoi> object.myarraypropertyname = myarray
[21:57:35] <darkpassenger> nice
[21:57:39] <darkpassenger> thank you
[21:57:45] <nesoi> CWSpear:  how could pageinit not be fired???
[21:57:54] <CWSpear> same reason?
[21:57:55] <CWSpear> lol, no idea
[21:58:35] <nesoi> no, in the case of pagechange, you don't specify the entity
[21:58:43] <nesoi> but for pageinit you do, so you have to have multiple ones
[21:58:50] <CWSpear> oh, lol
[21:58:51] <nesoi> for pagechange it may be that you should only have one
[21:58:52] <CWSpear> typo?
[21:59:57] <nesoi> I haven't touched that code though since it was working! :(
[22:00:32] <CWSpear> hmm. sorry
[22:14:51] <nesoi> weird
[22:15:26] <nesoi> CWSpear:  the problem this time was a comment which was / comment instead of // comment
[22:15:39] <CWSpear> dang
[22:20:18] <nesoi> everything else worked but the event… very odd
[22:33:14] <darkpassenger> is there a way to concatenate .each(element) into a var ?
[22:35:39] <batdorf> Any clever way to let 0 ring true? for example, var speed = input || this.options.speed; If input is 0, it defaults to the option
[22:36:45] <darkpassenger> ..
[22:45:07] <lenswipee> darkpassenger: yes?
[22:50:42] <nesoi> CWSpear:  are you still there?
[22:50:48] <CWSpear> yes
[22:51:31] <nesoi> could you take a look at this for me by chance? http://pastebin.com/ZH5rkk9M
[22:51:53] <nesoi> I'm trying to figure out why recipients has no length property
[22:52:03] <CWSpear> objects don't have lenths
[22:52:09] <CWSpear> I just saw your message in ##javascript, lol
[22:52:21] <CWSpear> {}.length doesn't work
[22:52:40] <CWSpear> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5223/length-of-javascript-object-ie-associative-array
[22:52:41] <nesoi> hm
[22:53:33] <CWSpear> there's also http://underscorejs.org/#size
[22:53:46] <nesoi> thing is, it was created in a loop with this assignment statement currentMessage.recipients[i] = alreadySelectedContacts[i];
[22:53:51] <nesoi> so it should be an array, no?
[22:54:03] <CWSpear> alreadySelectedContacts[i] could be ANYTHING
[22:54:17] <CWSpear> an object, a function, an array, null, undefined, int, double, etc
[22:54:24] <CWSpear> what makes you say it should be an array?
[22:54:49] <nesoi> no, recipients should be an array of whatever alreadyselectedcontacts is
[22:55:08] <nesoi> because I create it with currentMessage.recipients[i]
[22:55:11] <nesoi> which is array notation
[22:55:32] <CWSpear> Huh?
[22:56:00] <CWSpear> that's not "array notation"
[22:56:02] <nesoi> isn't anything[index] an array?
[22:56:06] <CWSpear> no
[22:56:13] <CWSpear> try this:
[22:56:31] <CWSpear> var str = 'name'; var obj = { name: 'CWSpear' }; obj[str];
[22:56:44] <CWSpear> what's that output in the console?
[22:57:06] <nesoi> ok, so how do I make it an array?
[22:57:40] <CWSpear> why do you want to make it an array?
[22:57:58] <nesoi> I do the same thing all over my code and it always works except here…
[22:58:04] <nesoi> I wonder why?
[22:58:18] <nesoi> because I want to iterate across its length
[22:58:47] <CWSpear> I showed you two ways to find its length as an object
[22:58:59] <CWSpear> you can use underscore.js to convert it to an array: http://underscorejs.org/#toArray
[22:59:25] <nesoi> which way to find its length??
[22:59:40] <CWSpear> @nesoi: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5223/length-of-javascript-object-ie-associative-array
[22:59:41] <nesoi> I do this everywhere though and it works everywhere else…
[22:59:54] <CWSpear> I don't know what to tell you. You did something to turn it into an object
[23:00:07] <CWSpear> maybe it's an array elsewhere, but that code you pasted is an Object
[23:00:14] <nesoi> for (var i=0; i< alreadySelectedContacts.length; ++i){
[23:00:14] <nesoi>         currentMessage.recipients[i] = alreadySelectedContacts[i];
[23:00:31] <nesoi> so the thing I'm assigning had a length property
[23:00:43] <lenswipee> it should be i++
[23:00:48] <lenswipee> not ++i
[23:01:11] <CWSpear> yeah, the way you have it skips 0
[23:01:18] <nesoi> I thought so, but I started with code like that and it seems to work…
[23:01:22] <nesoi> it doesn't though
[23:01:25] <nesoi> which is really odd
[23:01:36] <CWSpear> array/objects are tricky in JS
[23:01:38] <nesoi> I'll look at that next
[23:02:03] <nesoi> but anyway back to the array question. I assigned something with a length property, so why would the new variable suddenly not have one?
[23:02:44] <nesoi> I guess I could assign the whole thing at once…
[23:02:54] <nesoi> but I'm doing something else in the loop
[23:03:29] <CWSpear> where is currentMessage.recipients defined?
[23:03:40] <nesoi> hmm… I'm adding a property to it
[23:03:57] <nesoi> var currentMessage = {};
[23:04:09] <CWSpear> what about currentMessage.recipients?
[23:04:10] <nesoi> should be [] maybe
[23:04:18] <nesoi> but there's only one of 'em
[23:04:35] <nesoi> oops. that's the problem
[23:04:36] <nesoi> :)
[23:04:37] <nesoi> thanks
[23:04:43] <CWSpear> heh
[23:05:06] <nesoi> I'm amazed I can do anything because I actually don't know javascript or jquery
[23:05:28] <CWSpear> seems to be slow going
[23:06:36] <nesoi> yeah
[23:06:46] <nesoi> you noticed?
[23:06:47] <nesoi> :)
[23:07:06] <CWSpear> nesoi, thought of hiring someone that does know JavaScript?
[23:07:22] <nesoi> am I that bad??
[23:07:32] <lenswipee> yes
[23:07:39] <nesoi> hahah
[23:08:04] <nesoi> I'm just getting started though!
[23:08:27] <nesoi> I have one friend working with me on the server side, and he expects me to do this client side coding, so I'm trying to live up to it.
[23:09:07] <nesoi> also, I've had bad luck hiring programmers, unless they work for me full time
[23:09:17] <nesoi> and that would requirefunding
[23:09:22] <nesoi> which I don't have
[23:09:23] <nesoi> so..
[23:10:06] <nesoi> I could do this android app in java! but I don't know that either.
[23:10:39] <CWSpear> bad luck hiring freelance programmers? just gotta know where to look
[23:11:07] <d4rklit3> i have been coding since noon
[23:11:12] <d4rklit3> so hungry :(
[23:11:20] <nesoi> the problem with freelance programmers is that good ones are expensive, and I don't have money
[23:11:22] <CWSpear> what timezone are you in?
[23:11:34] <CWSpear> nesoi exactly
[23:11:50] <d4rklit3> PST
[23:11:58] <CWSpear> lol, go get some food
[23:12:02] <d4rklit3> i ought to
[23:12:06] <lenswipee> nesoi: good programmers are about 3x faster, so ends up cheaper
[23:12:07] <nesoi> when I've managed programmers, I always try to pay them well, but I'm not in that position atm
[23:12:08] <d4rklit3> i could just have beer instead
[23:12:35] <nesoi> actually I haven't really programmed for a job since the 80s
[23:12:41] <nesoi> maybe a bit in the 90s but not much
[23:12:42] <CWSpear> not to mention generally better code, easier to maintain, works, etc
[23:12:58] <CWSpear> punch cards?
[23:13:06] <nesoi> yeah, my code is probably lousy
[23:13:11] <nesoi> lots of globals :)
[23:13:22] <nesoi> I did use punch cards, but that was the 70s
[23:13:42] <nesoi> ok, dinner break
[23:13:51] <nesoi> thanks for the help and…. encouragement (?)
[23:13:57] <nesoi> :)
[23:14:34] <CWSpear> haha, good luck
[23:14:38] <CWSpear> he's gone
[23:27:28] <darkpassenger> how was punchcard ? :p
[23:31:11] <CWSpear> that wasn't me
[23:31:13] <CWSpear> he's long gone
[23:31:38] <CWSpear> My dad did punchcards tho
[23:31:54] <CWSpear> 1 computer for the university… took up an entire room
[23:32:04] <CWSpear> at least got him to switch to a Mac, lol
