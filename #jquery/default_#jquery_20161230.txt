[08:09:27] <pippuccio76> Hi at all , im tryng to create a progress bar with ajax

[09:07:10] <Deusdeorum|away> I am having a hard time to get the state of a radio button before clicking it. With current behavior it obviously returns "checked" all the time, but I want the behavior to return "not checked" if it is getting checked for the first time https://jsfiddle.net/69o1zeyw/
[09:08:00] <Deusdeorum|away> (wops, not first time - bad sentence, more if it is not checked but getting checked)
[09:10:00] <MikeD_> do you know why it isn't working?
[09:13:16] <MikeD_> Deusdeorum|away: https://jsfiddle.net/69o1zeyw/2/
[09:13:42] <Deusdeorum> I am guessing the state changes before alert gets fired? HTML before Jquery?
[09:14:17] <MikeD_> yes, by the time your click handler runs the radio button is already checked.
[09:14:33] <MikeD_> but if you're trying to get a 'change' just use the change event :)
[09:16:25] <Deusdeorum> actually what i want to do is to uncheck and different events if it is checked or unchecked.
[09:17:15] <MikeD_> uncheckable radio buttons are an abomination of UI  (my $0.02)
[09:18:06] <Deusdeorum> not sure what you mean :-)
[09:18:30] <Deusdeorum> should i not use radio buttons for this?
[09:18:53] <MikeD_> i don't know what your use-case looks like - the simplified jsfiddle is too simplified to tell much
[09:19:41] <MikeD_> if you are thinking to make a radio button that can be toggled, then use a checkbox
[09:20:28] <MikeD_> "yeah but..." i know we CAN make this weird thing, but it is not an expected feature of a radio button so user experience is ... weird.
[09:20:55] <Deusdeorum> okey, but then i have to make the checkboxes behave like radio buttons ie not be checked at same time
[09:21:00] <Deusdeorum> isn't that weird as well?
[09:21:07] <MikeD_> yes
[09:21:13] <Deusdeorum> but less weird?
[09:21:52] <Deusdeorum> take SO
[09:21:52] <MikeD_> are you really allowing someone to select "none" as a choice?
[09:22:11] <Deusdeorum> ops, take SO's up- and downvote system.. are those checkboxes?
[09:22:15] <MikeD_> if yes, then you should use a 3 state radio button :  A, B, none
[09:22:35] <MikeD_> i thought they are buttons
[09:24:19] <Deusdeorum> im looking for that behavior really, thought i could do it with a form and radio buttons, backend is built for that at the moment
[09:24:53] <MikeD_> then make another radio button option for "neither up nor down"
[09:25:11] <MikeD_> and make THAT be the default value for the button group
[09:25:56] <MikeD_> or ignore everything I said and do what you want
[09:26:02] <MikeD_> that's always an option too
[09:26:47] <Deusdeorum> Haha, no, I value your input because I rarely work with these kind of things. I didn't know it was weird unchecking radio buttons..
[09:27:38] <MikeD_> you mentioned the up/down vote... are you making a form with ratings or such that you then submit??
[09:28:00] <MikeD_> idk why two ?, that was not incredulity, just a typo
[09:28:00] <Deusdeorum> Yes, exactly..
[09:29:31] <MikeD_> ok... i'm this far into it... i'll make a fiddle
[09:32:57] <Deusdeorum> wow, nice one, I didn't think i was that far away lol
[10:03:54] <MikeD_> sorry, was distracted by a coworker
[10:07:24] <Deusdeorum> no problems at all, still stuck though experimenting MikeD_
[10:09:18] <ExeciN> I want to upload the selected file right after the user selects a file on <input type="file"></input>. I plan to upload the file using .ajax() What event should I bind to do that? Should I use "change" and check the <input> every time it changes? Is there something a bit more slick than "change"?
[10:10:59] <taplar> i'd think change is fine
[10:11:14] <taplar> what is your concern with it?
[10:11:35] <MikeD_> Deusdeorum: https://jsfiddle.net/69o1zeyw/6/
[10:14:02] <Deusdeorum> nice, but what if the middle button was removed and 0 triggered by checking the same arrow again MikeD_
[10:14:09] <Deusdeorum> then i will be stuck where I started right?
[10:14:34] <ExeciN> taplar: change is too general and the event would be fired on every change but if this is what I have to use I'll use it.
[10:16:25] <taplar> afaik change on a file input would only fire if the file is set/changed/removed
[10:19:00] <taplar> i guess i'm not seeing the over generality
[10:20:28] <taplar> Deusdeorum: that fiddle uses radios.  double clicking the same label sequentially would only result in one change event
[10:22:56] <Deusdeorum> yes, sure, first thought was different click event on different state, i.e checked or not checked.
[10:24:23] <MikeD_> you could use change to 'set' the current value of the group... i'll do that too
[10:26:56] <ExeciN> taplar: wouldn't it get fired if I add/remove/change attributes?
[10:27:13] <dglambert> morning
[10:27:30] <taplar> ExeciN: attributes of the input?  no
[10:27:54] <taplar> 'change' fires if the value of the input changes
[10:28:40] <taplar> there is no event that fires on attribute changes.  this is part of the reason why mutation observers are being developed
[10:29:19] <MikeD_> how do we get the value of a named group?  ... via the radio button "name" attribute?
[10:30:22] <taplar> MikeD_: groupValues[this.name] = this.value ?
[10:30:49] <taplar> dglambert: morning
[10:31:51] <Deusdeorum> why not input:radio[name='name]:checked.val()
[10:32:22] <taplar> i thought this was going to be inside a change event handler or something
[10:38:50] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/69o1zeyw/9/
[10:39:28] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/69o1zeyw/10/
[10:40:03] <MikeD_> that was much more fun than what i'm supposed to be working on
[10:43:23] <Deusdeorum> Ha, that's nice! thank you!
[10:43:36] <Deusdeorum> diff between 9 and 10 though?
[10:43:44] <Deusdeorum> ah checked already
[10:43:46] <MikeD_> made the 0 default checked
[10:44:24] <Deusdeorum> really neat
[10:44:34] <MikeD_> obviously the float and list item stuff is laziness for the sake of the example
[10:44:38] <MikeD_> ymmv
[10:45:20] <MikeD_> for a real example you'll probably use a nice icon instead of ^ and v
[10:46:47] <Deusdeorum> well, that comes later - have to change some backend, but this is exactly what i was after!
[10:54:42] <MikeD_> it's a neat trick to use the radio button for the mutually exclusive nature but also hide the radio button so we aren't setting the expectation of "radio" behavior
[10:55:05] <Doman> Hi! is there any limit how much json object could i get on my page?
[10:55:25] <MikeD_> Doman - how much time and memory do you have?
[10:56:11] <Doman> i see problem but is there any automatic somthing that blocking it
[10:56:41] <taplar> what is the problem you are seeing?
[10:57:16] <Doman> that it could take more memory that i have but it should be masive file
[10:57:54] <Doman> and i dont think i have here masive file and still it gets only 34 persons from my list
[10:58:01] <Doman> https://jsfiddle.net/1vctd30y/
[10:58:13] <taplar> 'that it could' is theoritical
[10:58:23] <taplar> what actual problem are you seeing?
[10:58:55] <Doman> i want to add all persons to table but it end on 34
[10:58:58] <Deusdeorum> MikeD_ yes, now when you say it it makes sense, didn't think about it before!
[11:00:04] <taplar> Doman: look at the console, you have errors
[11:00:31] <taplar> errors can cause early termination of logic.  fix them first
[11:01:55] <Doman> ok thx for help
[11:48:17] <igcewieling> using $.when and .then.  I am seriously confused about something, though not sure what.  https://jsfiddle.net/jhy4zfLp/       The output is "starting" and "two: start".   I expected to see "one:start" "two start" and "three start" a well as the one, two, three, and done resolve/reject message.
[11:51:30] <snover> igcewieling: you are resolving $.when to a function object.
[11:52:02] <igcewieling> Hmm...I thought I was resolving it with the return value of a function.
[11:52:22] <snover> you would need to actually call the function if you want to call the function.
[11:52:59] <igcewieling> I cannot use an annonymous function?
[11:53:29] <snover> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[11:53:52] <snover> “If a single argument is passed to jQuery.when() and it is not a Deferred or a Promise, it will be treated as a resolved Deferred and any doneCallbacks attached will be executed immediately.”
[11:55:25] <igcewieling> I'll re-work the code into functions.
[11:58:41] <igcewieling> hmmm..maybe I don't have to use a when.
[12:01:57] <igcewieling> I want to execute one() then when one() resolves or rejects the deferred, run two(), same for three.
[12:06:09] <igcewieling> maybe something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/oea4v3mq/28/
[12:09:00] <snover> stop using Math.random, your promises are randomly being rejected before they are resolved…
[12:09:29] <snover> rejected promises do not go to the success-function of a `then` call, they go to the failure-function, which you have not provided
[12:09:37] <igcewieling> snover: how can get them run randomly to simulate an async task?
[12:11:47] <igcewieling> the missing .done was a copy/paste mistake.
[12:14:15] <snover> you don’t need to waste wall time to simulate asynchronous operations, zero seconds of delay is still asynchronous. presumably you would also want your simulation to be predictable, which it isn’t right now
[12:17:14] <igcewieling> I was hoping for it to not be predictable when experimenting
[12:18:10] <igcewieling> this is not the production code.
[13:55:43] <igcewieling> I had two functions  each returning a Deferred object.   I want the second function to run if and only if the first function resolve()s.   I thought this should work, but the 2nd function is always executed.  https://jsfiddle.net/2fxemkba/11/
[13:56:18] <MassDebates> you think it shouldn't because of .done ?
[13:57:29] <igcewieling> The .done docs says "Description: Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is resolved."  The first function rejects, not resolves so it should not run .done(), correct?
[14:01:38] <taplar> your calling two() instead of just giving 'two' to the done
[14:03:38] <MassDebates> Figured it out
[14:03:41] <MassDebates> OH CMON
[14:03:51] <MassDebates> Well
[14:03:54] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/2fxemkba/12/ here it is anyways
[14:05:10] <igcewieling> taplar: I don't think I'll ever understand why, but that seems to have fixed it.
[14:05:23] <taplar> because two() is invoking the method
[14:05:38] <taplar> done() expects a callback which -it- will invoke when the first deferred resolves
[14:05:54] <igcewieling> I thought two() is running a function. 8-|  I don't work with OO much.
[14:06:05] <taplar> so giving it just 'two' gives it the function of two without executing it
[14:06:11] <taplar> and done() will execute it when it is ready
[14:08:17] <taplar> it's similar to the issue that people have in regards to doing stuff like: setTimeout( someMethod(), 5000);
[14:08:25] <MassDebates> What taplar is saying (and correct me if I'm wrong) is that the parenthesis "()" after two make it run even if you don't want it to. Without the (), you're simply just referencing (kinda like 'pointing at') the function itself.
[14:08:38] <MassDebates> at least that's how I look at it.
[14:08:44] <taplar> right, () causing it to invoke/execute
[14:08:53] <taplar> causing=causes
[14:08:53] <MassDebates> You're giving it parameters
[14:08:57] <MassDebates> RIght?
[14:09:03] <taplar> no, just executing it
[14:09:11] <taplar> err, wait
[14:09:13] <MassDebates> Well, no parameters
[14:09:13] <taplar> 'it' ?
[14:09:23] <MassDebates> Yes, like
[14:09:31] <MassDebates> two() is diferent than two
[14:09:50] <MassDebates> because the two() has paramaters, which is two(" ") <--- empty, but still params
[14:09:51] <MassDebates> Right?
[14:09:52] <taplar> two is a function reference.  two() is the execution of the function referenced
[14:09:56] <MassDebates> YESSSS
[14:09:59] <MassDebates> FIST PUMPALICIOUS
[14:10:09] <MassDebates> I AM tHE JKWERTY MASTAR
[14:10:12] <igcewieling> If I was using .then() I would also do .then(two) instead of .then(two()), correct?
[14:10:17] <taplar> right
[14:10:25] <taplar> they want callbacks
[14:10:42] <MassDebates> For the record tho
[14:10:47] <MassDebates> I solved it on my own before I saw taplar
[14:10:56] <MassDebates> the reason why I helped you is because I thought nobody else was here
[14:11:07] <MassDebates> but then I forgot that taplar manually installed his consciousness inside of a server years ago
[14:11:11] <taplar> you should help anyway brah, ;)
[14:11:12] <MassDebates> So he's just like, always here
[14:11:27] <MassDebates> yeah but I don't want to get in the way of the good solutions with my shitty ones
[14:11:33] <igcewieling> [TK]D-fender is that on #asterisk.
[14:11:46] <MassDebates> ?
[14:12:01] <igcewieling> uploaded  consciousness to IRC
[14:12:20] <MassDebates> Oh yeah taplar's our human jquery cyborg
[14:12:52] <MassDebates> It's an honor, actually. You must have proven dedication and skill in order to be given that opportunity.
[14:13:27] <taplar> nah, just three monitors
[14:13:52] <igcewieling> MassDebates: I used to think that too.  Now I just think of it as a geek form of OCD.  lol
[14:14:07] <MassDebates> lol
[14:14:17] <MassDebates> In all seriousness, taplar is an excellent resource and has helped me out more than once
[14:14:23] <MassDebates> and so is duch
[14:14:24] <MassDebates> duc
[14:14:29] <MassDebates> hmm robe
[14:14:38] <MassDebates> Well, some other dude here is really helpful too.
[14:14:52] <taplar> duch_kazatel or robertmaxrees
[14:14:55] <taplar> same guy
[14:14:58] <MassDebates> That's the one!
[14:15:30] <taplar> but you can't forget shoky and decx and Uhkis
[14:15:49] <MassDebates> I've seen shoky but I've not encountered the other too
[14:15:58] <MassDebates> two*
[14:16:04] <MassDebates> God english
[14:16:13] <igcewieling> thanks taplar and MassDebates.
[14:16:15] <MassDebates> If english was a coding language I'd say it should be deprecated
[14:16:20] <MassDebates> And burned
[14:16:25] <MassDebates> No problem igcewieling !
[14:16:37] <MassDebates> I enjoyed the test, actually. It was something I could actually -DO-!
[14:16:51] <MassDebates> taplar:  bored?
[14:16:53] <taplar> MassDebates: i was actually thinking about that the other day.  after someone came in here or some where and suggested that to some people the language barrier hinders some people from becoming programmers
[14:17:07] <MassDebates> Oh yeah absolutely
[14:17:09] <MassDebates> It's not specs
[14:17:11] <MassDebates> think about URL
[14:17:23] <taplar> it's interesting that there are not like other things that allow them to code in their native language
[14:17:45] <MassDebates> Call me a tin-foil hat wearer, but I think it's intentional.
[14:18:04] <taplar> possibly
[14:18:07] <MassDebates> It's really funny to see it in documentation with chinese/japanese text, though.
[14:18:16] <MassDebates> Like all of these lines and shit and then in the middle is like "URL"
[14:19:23] <MassDebates> hey taplar I'm not going to bug you about a CSS challenge or anything
[14:19:24] <taplar> i dunno if it is intentional or if it is just based off of where the languages originated from
[14:19:41] <MassDebates> but What is something you think would make me 'stretch' my basic capabilities with jquery?
[14:19:58] <MassDebates> I wanna try doing something
[14:20:05] <MassDebates> but I don't want it to be too hard
[14:20:13] <MassDebates> but something I've not had to figure out before
[14:20:31] <MassDebates> (with jquery not specifically css/html)
[14:20:35] <taplar> i dunno that i can claim that i know the breath of your jquery experience
[14:20:56] <MassDebates> Assume bad cause I'm bad
[14:21:02] <MassDebates> er sorry
[14:21:06] <MassDebates> assume beginner because im beginner
[14:21:14] <taplar> what's your experience with unit testing javascript?
[14:21:25] <MassDebates> uh
[14:21:42] <MassDebates> Oh yeah
[14:21:43] <taplar> >:)
[14:21:45] <MassDebates> yeah I don't like that
[14:21:51] <MassDebates> Give me something fun
[14:22:02] <taplar> if you don't have much, i'd suggest trying to learn qunit or jasmine
[14:22:19] <MassDebates> This isn't my idea of jquery recreation
[14:22:21] <MassDebates> >.>
[14:22:25] <MassDebates> But okay
[14:22:26] <taplar> lol
[14:22:27] <MassDebates> I'll learn qunit
[14:22:33] <taplar> here's the thing though, and why i ask
[14:22:54] <taplar> if you have to test your stuff, it brings to light new thought processes about how you write your code
[14:23:12] <taplar> and it can lead to different practices and often better coding
[14:23:20] <MassDebates> I don't have any practices
[14:23:21] <MassDebates> Atm
[14:23:32] <MassDebates> It's about the equivalent to my amazon shopping practices
[14:23:49] <taplar> do you write just scriptlets?
[14:24:04] <MassDebates> more like scriptletsletslets
[14:24:15] <MassDebates> a few functions making something tied together is my biggest
[14:24:26] <taplar> do you have an example of something you've written?
[14:24:40] <MassDebates> yeah
[14:24:43] <MassDebates> 2 secs
[14:25:41] <MassDebates> Uh
[14:25:50] <MassDebates> I'd prefer you not share this - it's a private codepen
[14:25:57] <taplar> np
[14:27:23] <MassDebates> okay and its not clean
[14:27:24] <MassDebates> okay
[14:27:35] <MassDebates> actually its bad practice
[14:28:30] <taplar> that's fine.  you said you don't have any practices so i wanted to see something to written to possibly refute that statement, ;)
[14:28:40] <taplar> to=you've
[14:29:03] <MassDebates> Shit, I can't do anything about the links.
[14:29:10] <MassDebates> They go to one of my websites
[14:30:01] <MassDebates> PMing
[14:34:47] <MassDebates> I'll unit test this
[14:34:57] <MassDebates> But I won't like it.
[14:35:07] <taplar> heh, no one likes unit testing
[14:35:20] <taplar> until you have a big base of it and you go to change something and they save your ass
[14:35:26] <taplar> and then you quickly change your tune
[14:36:12] <taplar> and they are only as hard as you make them, really
[14:36:32] <taplar> if you have difficulty testing something, it can be an indication that possibly the logic needs to be rethought or broken up
[14:36:47] <MassDebates> How's the code in it though?
[14:36:48] <MassDebates> smelly?
[14:36:57] <taplar> that example you gave?
[14:37:02] <MassDebates> yush
[14:37:22] <taplar> the $$ declaration seems strage to me
[14:39:17] <taplar> and you could possibly reuse $$ in following places where you are using querySelector(All)
[14:39:32] <MassDebates> Hm
[14:39:38] <MassDebates> I was worried about my use of the timer
[14:39:45] <MassDebates> er, like a TTL i guess
[14:39:53] <taplar> the timeout?
[14:40:10] <MassDebates> yes
[14:40:21] <taplar> oh there are a couple
[14:42:07] <taplar> if you used a forEach for the links iteration, you could save having to build one of those functions to preserve the link, if i'm reading this right
[14:42:40] <MassDebates> $$('.mdl-drawer__link').forEach(function(element) {
[14:42:55] <taplar> you'd have to convert it to an array first
[14:43:08] <taplar> oh wait, your doing slice on it
[14:43:20] <taplar> i guess that turns it into an array?  so that would work if so
[14:44:08] <taplar> small side note though, instead of `[].slice.call` you can do `Array.prototype.slice.call` to save an unnecessary array instantiation
[14:44:55] <taplar> otherwise, most of the things that my eye is catching is just possibly personal preference.  like some things could use truthyness instead of checking >0 or whatever
[16:53:49] <SideFX> Is there a way I can use debugger or something in the browser to figure out what script is causing a drop down to appear?
[16:55:43] <wwspider> SideFX: yes, just google it.. for example for chrome
[16:56:00] <wwspider> I guess you mean something complementary to the standard developer tools, right ?
[16:57:38] <SideFX> I'm not sure
[16:57:59] <SideFX> Somethig to see when a mouseover is being activated
[18:44:21] <troop> hello.
[18:45:29] <troop> i have an id element which is assigned into a variable named element. it has some childs. how can i point some child and grandchild with using it for example $(element + ">.someclass>.someclass") is valid?
