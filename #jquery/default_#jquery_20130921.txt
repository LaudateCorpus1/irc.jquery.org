[00:47:58] <TF35Strike> hey all, I'm doing some simple coding with .replaceWith calls changing the background color of a div. I can't get the background color to change the 2nd time I execute this code and I'm not sure why. If someone could take a look it would be great (click the buttons I want the grey to remain on whatever button you clicked last, at the moment it only changes the first time you click) Any help would be great http://jsfiddle.net/Z6

[01:53:45] <Zackko> Is it safe (in terms of butchering the DOM) to take HTML that was entered in a textarea and spit it out in a <div> to show the user a preview of what they entered? If not, how can I do this safely?
[02:05:07] <grafi> as long as its valid html ...
[02:05:14] <grafi> so all tags closed and stuff
[02:05:28] <grafi> without javascript probably
[02:05:42] <grafi> could be a lot of work to sanitize Zackko
[02:15:27] <Zackko> grafi: Yea I can't bank on it being valid lol that's the issue. All I can think of is iframe :/
[02:15:44] <grafi> yeah
[02:16:14] <ph88> no
[02:33:41] <jon_x2> can someone help me with this.  I take a list, convert it to a dropdown and want to set the selected value.  For some reason I can't get the selected value to show/work and have tried different options
[02:33:42] <jon_x2> http://jsfiddle.net/KRg4u/
[02:34:01] <jon_x2> or better formatted I think
[02:34:02] <jon_x2> http://jsfiddle.net/KRg4u/1/
[02:35:11] <jon_x2> I've tried looping over the options, using val, using what I'm showing.. nothing.
[02:42:26] <sahbeewah> jon_x2, http://jsfiddle.net/ngbR3/
[02:44:20] <jon_x2> thanks sahbeewah was trying all the wrong approaches .. appreciate it
[02:45:14] <doug65536> I wish there were a way to addClass / removeClass but pass a boolean value which says whether I want it added or removed :|
[02:49:24] <mitzev_> i have a div with tabs
[02:49:35] <mitzev_> if u click each table title, the tab switches to that tab
[02:49:37] <Guest21584> doug65536 like toggleClass?
[02:49:38] <Guest21584> o√¥
[02:49:44] <mitzev_> how can i make it so a text link in one tab, activates the next tab
[02:52:00] <doug65536> grafi: thanks, never noticed that overload before
[02:54:11] <doug65536> I realized that bootstrap.wizard was buggy as hell so I am writing my own wizard plugin that actually works right
[02:54:42] <doug65536> had "did he even try it once" bugs
[02:54:50] <grafi> hm
[02:54:55] <grafi> who would have thought
[02:55:59] <doug65536> it calls callbacks so early in its initialization that its entire API is broken
[02:56:25] <doug65536> it hasn't even set itself up and it calls callbacks so you try to call the api and it crashes
[02:56:48] <grafi> sound like happy fun times
[02:57:12] <doug65536> for example, if you have a tabChange callback, and you use the api to find out about the wizard (current tab, count) it hasn't set its .data yet and crashes :|
[02:58:08] <doug65536> so I fixed that and found a bunch of hacks where he subtracts 1 and adds 1 at random places, apparently hacky fixes for something, or he doesn't like zero based tabs? who knows. I am writing my own
[02:58:21] <grafi> xD
[02:58:31] <grafi> dont forget to put it on github :D
[02:58:55] <doug65536> yeah, I probably will
[03:28:43] <HenryCH> http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_dim_innerwidth_height
[03:29:04] <HenryCH> if padding works inside the div, why is innerwidth/height greater than the div width/height?
[03:30:28] <HenryCH> shouldn't innerheight/width be 80 and 280?
[03:32:31] <joobz> HenryCH, padding adds to the width of the element
[03:37:48] <HenryCH> Ok, so what have I done wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/FMqZd/
[03:38:16] <HenryCH> shouldn't the bottom rectangle show 300 100 for both

[03:47:22] <joobz> ahh
[03:47:25] <joobz> it's your damn variable
[03:47:34] <joobz> $("#div2").html(txt);

[07:16:03] <cncvikto> hi everyone!
[07:17:26] <cncvikto> I'd like to ask something about jquery.. is it the right place? :D
[07:19:18] <dAnjou> cncvikto: of course not
[07:19:33] <dAnjou> the channel name is #jquery and the topic says jQuery 2.0.3 & jQuery 1.10.2 http://jquery.com
[07:19:50] <dAnjou> how can you think this would be the right place??
[07:20:02] <cncvikto> thank you so much dAnjoy!
[07:20:15] <cncvikto> it wos a joke (I hope..)
[07:20:26] <cncvikto> so the question..
[07:20:29] <cncvikto> I use a datepicker and I would like to pulsate the selected days. What do you suggest: to modify the datepicker (it is made by keith wood, its not the official datepicker) or..
[07:21:57] <cncvikto> ...or I know the style tag name of the selected tag, and connect the pulsate function to it?
[07:24:14] <cncvikto> the second solution seems to be easier but I should use event I think
[07:40:34] <dwarder> how do i get id (#) of the element i clicked on from an event object?
[07:47:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> dwarder: $(this).attr("id");
[07:49:19] <dwarder> ecky--ptang-zoob: not $(event).attr("id"); ?
[07:50:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what's your element?
[07:50:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and how do you catch the click?
[07:52:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $(document).on("click", "#someelement", function (e) { var id = $(this).attr("id"); })
[07:52:13] <dwarder> ecky--ptang-zoob: yes, like this thank you
[07:56:46] <dwarder> ecky--ptang-zoob: what should i do if i have nested "#someelelnt" and it is a class, so it got called several time,  event.stopPropagation(); doesn't seem to work
[07:57:05] <dwarder> times*
[07:57:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What do you mean nested in a class? Better paste your code :)
[07:57:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you can't nest elements in a class
[07:57:56] <dwarder> i have <li>a<ul><li>a
[07:58:12] <dwarder> i just shouldnt'
[07:58:14] <dwarder> i see
[07:58:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ???
[07:58:34] <dwarder> ecky--ptang-zoob: i assigned class to every li ..
[07:59:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it doesn't matter if #someelement is nested... # is a unique id - so you can select it with jquery
[07:59:43] <dwarder> ecky--ptang-zoob: no it wasn 'cause it was a class in my case, <li class="something"   yeah it was stupid :)
[07:59:46] <mintux> what is the light and easy way to encryption and decryption data between php and javascript ? i need it for ajax
[08:00:07] <dwarder> why do you need to encript?

[08:00:55] <codepython777> whats the syntax here in this 2 liner: http://bpaste.net/show/C6qLGmW1pkCXb1HlpYPm/ ?
[08:00:57] <mintux> ecky--ptang-zoob: json is simple convert i want to encrypt json with php then decrypt json with javascript
[08:01:24] <codepython777> Error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[08:01:25] <jp-> mintux, use ssl
[08:05:13] <dwarder> ecky--ptang-zoob: this got called 6 times $("#wrapper").on("click",".catalogs a", function(event) {
[08:05:21] <dwarder> ecky--ptang-zoob: one click made
[08:05:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How can I know why if I don't see the html of that??
[08:05:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I guess you have 6 links inside catalogs??

[08:20:17] <boytoy_> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/YYTMQ/ using Packery -- I have a bunch of photos that are all the same size. This makes for a very monotonous look, so I was wondering: Is there a way to randomly size my items? With extra emphasis on filling the empty space that usually appears to the right side of the browser window once all items are packed?
[09:10:14] <mdev> can i just make up info names to pass for html divs?
[09:10:36] <mdev> like <div="whatever" mymadeup=mydata></div>
[09:10:53] <mdev> using unique id can only go so far
[09:14:01] <mdev> jquery, one of the biggest channels, one of the quietest channels
[09:15:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> mdev: yes, but I don't think it will validate with W3C if you use xhtml
[09:15:30] <Zarthus> mdev: 5 minutes of patience is not a whole lot
[09:15:34] <mdev> thanks, any keywords you can give me to google?
[09:15:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but why don't you use classes?
[09:15:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you can select elements by class or multiple classes
[09:16:04] <Zarthus> ecky--ptang-zoob: It won't validate with w3 on any type of html probably
[09:16:12] <mdev> oh I already am but what i'm saying is I need to pass data too
[09:16:20] <mdev> not just a class name, but a variable with it that's unique
[09:16:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> In html5 you can do: <div class="x" data-ref="x" />
[09:16:32] <Zarthus> mdev: in a .. div?
[09:16:58] <mdev> yeah in a div...it's dynamically generated based on interaction so need to pass a few values on
[09:17:04] <mdev> and i'll google data-ref thanks
[09:17:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know how to use this? http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_object_object.js.html
[09:17:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It looks very useful but is has stuff like goog.object.
[09:17:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How to use in a real app?
[09:17:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> goog.provide('goog.object'); - will JS recognize this?
[09:19:56] <mdev> data-whatever="mystuff" is perfect
[09:19:57] <mdev> tanks

[09:57:12] <fission6> i am trying to call a function which makes a simple fetch to a url and returns the results, how do i do this so it doesn't block
[10:13:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Why does this not work? $(this) + " option:selected").text(); ? inside a "change" event handler
[10:17:31] <beachandbytes> $("option:selected", this);
[10:25:56] <fission6> anyone available to help with a promise/deferred question, need help refactoring this bit of code which fetches a web serves on a blur() https://dpaste.de/RqJmK/
[10:29:23] <HarryPitfall> or $(this).find('option:selected')
[10:34:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ty
[10:36:09] <shoky> fission6: https://dpaste.de/a6AqR/
[10:36:49] <fission6> shoky: thanks! i was actually on a similar path, with 'then' being what I needed
[10:36:57] <fission6> let me pop this in and see
[10:37:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if you loop over TDs, how would you retrieve the id of the container tr?
[10:37:36] <trinode> hey, if I have a url how do I compare it to the current URL in jQM?
[10:37:58] <shoky> fission6: oops i deleted  var $field = $(this);
[10:38:06] <Velveeta> $(this).parent().attend('id');
[10:38:08] <fission6> thats ok, reviewing
[10:38:11] <trinode> I realise this is a basic question
[10:38:21] <trinode> but a simple indexOf isn't working
[10:38:30] <Velveeta> Attr, not attend, stupid autocorrect
[10:39:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh right
[10:39:52] <Velveeta> Trinode: what indexof are you trying to execute?
[10:39:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can i do parent('tr') ?
[10:40:37] <Velveeta> Ecky: sure, our .closest('tr')
[10:40:45] <Velveeta> Or*
[10:41:09] <Velveeta> This is my first time on irc from a phone, I'm gonna murder this autocorrect
[10:44:17] <fission6> thanks shoky in a good sop tnow
[10:45:40] <trinode> Velveeta: a string ('file:///android_asset/www/mainScreen.html').indexOf('/android_asset/www/mainScreen.html') is always -1
[10:46:02] <trinode> those values are from $.mobile.activePage.data('url');
[10:46:07] <trinode> and a link
[10:46:30] <Velveeta> Hmmmm, that's weird
[10:46:55] <trinode> Velveeta: you're telling me, it's driving me insane
[10:47:03] <trinode> checked typeof
[10:47:06] <trinode> both strings
[10:47:41] <Velveeta> You could maybe try converting your search string into a	RegExp object and matching against the source string
[10:48:24] <trinode> Velveeta: I've spent 30 mins on this.... and I think I had my variables backwards
[10:48:27] <Velveeta> It'd definitely be more overhead that way, and I don't see why it should work over the indexof method, but there's one way to find out :D
[10:48:29] <trinode> O M G
[10:48:33] <Velveeta> Lol
[10:49:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have 5 javascript objects inside an array... Each object has an ID - How do I find the object with ID 5 in the array? Do I need to loop over all or can it be done simpler?
[10:50:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so array[object1, object2, object3] and object3 = {"id" : "5", "name" : "test"}
[10:50:35] <Velveeta> Ecky: there are abstracted methods for fond that to make it syntactically easier, but they all involve iterating over the array of objects, so no performance gain
[10:50:53] <Velveeta> For doing* that
[10:50:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> abstracted methods?
[10:50:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> where?
[10:51:15] <_rgn> _.findWhere(array, { id: '5' });
[10:51:16] <Velveeta> Look up jQuery.grep
[10:51:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> won't that be really slow for large objects?
[10:51:53] <Velveeta> Or yes, the underscore methods work nicely also, and are faster, if you already have underscore in your stack
[10:52:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is that standard in jquery?
[10:52:24] <Velveeta> Underscore is a separate library
[10:52:36] <Velveeta> But grep is standard jQuery
[10:52:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so how would that work in my example?
[10:53:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> grep
[10:53:08] <Velveeta> Go look up jQuery.grep
[10:54:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $.grep(myarray, function() { } );
[10:54:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I need to find that ID and change the name value
[10:55:15] <_rgn> use this as an opportunity to learn how to read jquery docs
[10:55:19] <_rgn> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[10:55:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm reading
[10:55:40] <Velveeta> You could always change the data format of that object to be an actual object, keyed by the id value, if id id unique
[10:56:09] <Velveeta> If id is* unique
[10:56:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no I'm not allowed to change it... it comes from server in json format
[10:56:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How about this? http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_object_object.js.html
[10:57:38] <Velveeta> If you're looking to drop in a whole other library to solve this problem, just go with underscore
[10:58:05] <Velveeta> But it's a simple enough problem that it could just be fixed with grep
[10:58:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the problem with that grep thing is that it expects an index as param
[10:59:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> And it's just the index I need to find,
[10:59:09] <Velveeta> No, it receives an index as a param, you can just ignore that
[10:59:43] <Velveeta> It receives the array index for the current item being examined, along with the item
[10:59:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the second param is a function
[11:00:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the docs just put a lame example with numbers in there
[11:00:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why don't they put something useful there?
[11:00:37] <Velveeta> Grep itself takes 2 params, the array and the callback per item
[11:01:08] <Velveeta> The callback receives 2 params per iteration, the array index for the current item,.and the current item
[11:02:22] <Velveeta> I found the documentation perfectly suitable for learning that function when I first needed to
[11:02:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ok I have this: $.grep(instances, function (item, index) {});
[11:03:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> item is 1 object then?
[11:03:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is i can do item["id"] ?
[11:03:32] <Velveeta> Right
[11:03:47] <_rgn> you wouldn't have to be asking these questions if you tried it out and used console.log()
[11:04:00] <Velveeta> And if it matches, return true, otherwise,.false
[11:04:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if (instance["id"] == instanceid) {
[11:04:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> return true;
[11:04:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> }
[11:04:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> N
[11:05:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so it finds a match, then what?
[11:06:23] <Velveeta> Read the docs,.examine your output
[11:07:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok ok
[11:12:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> does closest() also work for closest sibling?
[11:13:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a td ID and need to find the tr within the same table with a certain class
[11:13:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> not necessarily is that the wrapper tr of the td
[11:14:42] <Velveeta> Closest only works for the current element and it's parents, not siblings, you'd use the siblings method for that
[11:15:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, but i need to find the closest sibling HIGHER in the dom
[11:15:40] <Velveeta> Right
[11:15:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if lower in the dom is a closer sibling that matches, it should not return that
[11:15:54] <Velveeta> So chain in the siblings method
[11:16:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> must only go upwards
[11:17:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have this: $(this).closest("tr").siblings("tr.target").attr('id')
[11:18:19] <Velveeta> And does it work as expected?
[11:18:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yes, but it's not fullproof, it needs to go upwards only :(
[11:18:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if there happens to be a tr.target below the tr, it will pick that one
[11:19:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> actually no, this siblings thing returns all sigbling with class target
[11:19:24] <Velveeta> Right
[11:19:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that's not useful
[11:19:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so siblings("tr.target") - from that result, how to get the right tr?
[11:20:04] <Velveeta> Well then you need a better way of finding your target node
[11:20:25] <Velveeta> I have no clue, it depends entirely on your business logic
[11:20:46] <Velveeta> How am I supposed to know what the "right" target is?
[11:21:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I just told you, the tr with class target ABOVE the tr I have, the closest one upwards
[11:21:14] <Velveeta> You need to define a way that uniquely identifies your target,.and use that to locate it
[11:22:04] <Velveeta> Then use .closest('tr.target')
[11:22:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> then if there is a tr with target 3 rows higher and 1 row lower another one with class target, it will pick the row below
[11:23:16] <Velveeta> Closest only goes same level and up, not lower
[11:24:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> on what element do I apply the closest then?
[11:24:50] <Velveeta> Your td if that's what you want the closest tr.target for
[11:25:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it will find that tr even if it is not the parent of the td??
[11:25:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I get an error for that
[11:27:32] <Velveeta> If you want the closest target parent that's not the td's immediate patent, then you'll have to apply the search higher, like $(this).closest ('tr').parent().closest ('tr.target')
[11:29:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no, then it will select the parent and find the closest tr.target to the table
[11:30:12] <Velveeta> What the Fuck
[11:30:50] <Velveeta> What *exactly* are you trying to find? Give me an actual use case or a demo at jsfiddle
[11:30:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $(this).closest("tr.part").prev("tr.task").attr('id') - maybe like that
[11:31:12] <Velveeta> Because what you keep saying is just going in circles
[11:31:50] <Velveeta> You say you need a parent tr, then no, one of it's siblings,.then no, the closest parent to the patent, then no,.the prev tr
[11:32:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, let me make a paste
[11:34:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Here: http://pastebin.com/GEah7J7U
[11:37:06] <Velveeta> There's no way to uniquely identify that as a target with that markup, you would have to specifically mediately there with like .parent ().prev().prev() or something
[11:37:24] <Velveeta> Navigate*
[11:38:27] <Velveeta> Do you need the closest *previous* tr.target?
[11:38:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I think if I do prev("tr.target") it will find the first previous tr with that class?
[11:38:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes...
[11:38:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> like I said 100 times :p
[11:39:49] <Velveeta> That's not what you were saying, you said closest, you said patent, and you said sibling, there's a difference between that and parent's closest previous sibling
[11:40:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> closest parent, and from that parent, closest previous sibling
[11:41:01] <Velveeta> Use $(this).closest ('tr').prevAll('tr.target').first () should do it
[11:41:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> won't that select all tr with class parent and then pick the first tr in the table with that clas?
[11:41:41] <Velveeta> If not, try .last (), it'll depend on how jQuery constructs that collection
[11:42:36] <Velveeta> Just try it, my wife's eye exam is over, so I gotta go
[11:42:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, ty
[11:54:04] <sunbeam> how can i add the class selected to the first li of a ul ?
[11:54:06] <sunbeam> any idea
[11:54:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> does anyone know  how i can turn a regular progress bar into a circular one
[11:54:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> one where i can specify the amount completed
[11:54:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> preferably not a plugin
[12:01:04] <Velveeta> And we're at lunch now so I'm back

[13:54:39] <wer0ckz> hi. i'm using this plugin: http://keith-wood.name/countdownRef.html - i have a code: $('#countdown_'+prod_id).countdown({until: prod_date_exp, onExpiry: callwinner, alwaysExpire: true});	 to call the plugin. but that code is on a loop function with an increment variable called: prod_id
[13:55:11] <wer0ckz> it calls the function callwinner() . i want to insert the prod_id to callwinner function something like callwinner(prod_id). how can i do that?
[13:55:12] <wer0ckz> thanks
[13:57:23] <wer0ckz> $(document).ready(function() {  function callwinner(prod_id) { 		alert("and the winnder is..."+prod_id); } }

[14:09:54] <razzi> $(document).ready(  function callwinner(prod_id) { alert("and the winnder is..."+prod_id); } );
[14:09:55] <razzi> try that
[14:10:49] <wer0ckz> ok
[14:12:09] <wer0ckz> i got this:
[14:12:09] <wer0ckz> and the winnder is...function ( selector, context ) { 		// The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced' 		return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context, rootjQuery ); 	}

[14:28:47] <jned> I need help to create a special toggle type ui.  I want a .click(function() to toggle between two functions, like first, third, 5th.. click, run function1, and second, 4th, 6th... click run function2.  Is this possible? I can think of how it could be done
[14:29:29] <doug65536> jned: easy way: use .one('click' instead of .click, and use .one to setup the "next" handler in each handler
[14:29:30] <grafi> You can? Then do it!
[14:29:31] <grafi> :D
[14:29:47] <grafi> ugh doug65536
[14:29:48] <grafi> :P
[14:29:56] <jned> .one? never heard of it
[14:30:01] <doug65536> jned: probably not the best way to handle state but if you want to do it like that :)
[14:30:25] <doug65536> jned: yeah, it handles one event, then deletes the handler
[14:30:26] <grafi> just toggle a flag
[14:30:27] <grafi> :P
[14:30:29] <jned> actually, I realized .toggle will work, I thought it was just for show hide, but it can do exactly what I just mentioned

[14:46:26] <zmode> grafi: the user enters a start date and an end date and an array of dates is populated based on those two dates, including copying them to that array

[14:46:43] <grafi> i see

[15:00:20] <zmode> doug65536: that's how it should work. what made you pick closest()?
[15:00:30] <ChevyPL> the problem is when I'm trying toggle classes

[15:01:02] <ChevyPL> classes has been changed

[15:01:40] <ChevyPL> difficult to explain
[15:01:51] <ChevyPL> best ide
[15:01:53] <ChevyPL> idea
[15:02:01] <ChevyPL> is jus show the code
[15:02:12] <zmode> doug65536: parents() was working in the same way. i thought it was more relevant. but thank you either way. now to figure out why it only works for the first table in the actual page
[15:02:31] <doug65536> zmode: you can leave the html broken and wrong if you wish
[15:03:04] <zmode> doug65536: my html is right in the application. it partly works there too. the issue must be elsewhere
[15:03:27] <doug65536> zmode: are you reading anything I am saying? it is nonsense to have inputs as child of <table>
[15:03:39] <zmode> doug65536: i have <tr> and <td> in my application
[15:03:44] <zmode> doug65536: it was a mistake of mine in jsfiddle
[15:03:51] <doug65536> zmode: oh ok good
[15:04:01] <doug65536> zmode: closest will find the closest parent that matches
[15:04:08] <zmode> doug65536: your code works well and so does parents() instead of parent()
[15:04:36] <doug65536> zmode: you rarely want parents(), you almost always really want closest if you think you want parents()
[15:05:13] <tw2113> does closest() work both forwards and backwards? i was never sure
[15:05:15] <doug65536> .closest
[15:05:31] <doug65536> tw2113:  only looks at itself, and its parents
[15:05:38] <zmode> doug65536: thanks. i'll read on closest. the issue seems to be on some other javascript code

[15:12:03] <grafi> `factoid
[15:12:15] <ChevyPL> ok that is the code: http://chevy.horsemotor.com/ajax.js
[15:12:24] <grafi> `urbandictionary factoid
[15:12:40] <doug65536> ChevyPL: where is the <script> tag that loads that
[15:12:43] <ChevyPL> pupose is simply
[15:12:54] <doug65536> ChevyPL: in head?
[15:13:13] <ChevyPL> what you mena in head?
[15:13:18] <ChevyPL> mean
[15:13:44] <grafi> its all in your head
[15:13:50] <grafi> head tag of the thml he means
[15:13:53] <doug65536> ChevyPL: in the html. is it in the head tag
[15:13:54] <grafi> <head>
[15:13:55] <grafi> <:
[15:13:59] <grafi> </head>
[15:14:41] <ChevyPL> ok let me explain firstly than you decide that header are really required
[15:14:45] <ChevyPL> pupose is simple
[15:14:55] <ChevyPL> i have delete button
[15:15:22] <ChevyPL> when I click on it I'm sending request to server which works perfect
[15:15:44] <ChevyPL> but after that class name should change to revert button
[15:16:11] <ChevyPL> and then when I click again on the same place I should click on revert button (class toggle)
[15:16:20] <ChevyPL> and send request as revert
[15:16:22] <ChevyPL> to server
[15:16:36] <ChevyPL> class is toglle fine
[15:16:39] <ChevyPL> images changed
[15:16:50] <ChevyPL> but it's going same request to the server
[15:17:34] <ChevyPL> it'w works when I refresh website
[15:17:48] <ChevyPL> but that not make a sens whe I use jquery ;P
[15:19:35] <grafi> so basically toggleclass is not working for you?
[15:19:46] <ChevyPL> toggle class works
[15:19:57] <ChevyPL> because class has been change
[15:20:02] <ChevyPL> but
[15:20:11] <ChevyPL> selector not works
[15:20:35] <ChevyPL> when you click on $(icon_delete)
[15:20:56] <ChevyPL> it's going to toggle clas to $(icon_revert)
[15:21:06] <ChevyPL> and this level works fine
[15:21:46] <ChevyPL> but ajax request supose to be as /admin/revert
[15:22:11] <ChevyPL> even if classes has been change request to server is still same
[15:22:37] <grafi> i see
[15:23:10] <grafi> thats probably because the eventhandler is already bound to the elements
[15:23:23] <ChevyPL> maybe
[15:23:32] <ChevyPL> it's any chance to fix it
[15:23:42] <ChevyPL> ?
[15:23:51] <grafi> maybe bind to the element your items are all in
[15:24:11] <grafi> $(parent).on('click', '.icon-delete', function() {});
[15:24:20] <grafi> where the parent doesnt change
[15:24:30] <grafi> that could work
[15:26:23] <ChevyPL> but that have to be call instead current selector ?
[15:26:40] <ChevyPL> $(icon_rever)
[15:27:07] <ChevyPL> or somewhere nested
[15:27:32] <grafi> where is $(icon_revert) comming from?
[15:28:11] <grafi> or is this $(".icon_revert") it?
[15:28:15] <ChevyPL> sorry $(".icon_delete_all") that is selctro for delete button $(".icon_revert") that one is for revert
[15:29:24] <grafi> okay
[15:30:56] <grafi> ChevyPL http://pastebin.com/uSXZeup5 like that, you will have to fill in the parent selector though
[15:31:16] <grafi> the root element for all the items you are deleting an undeleting
[15:31:47] <grafi> if you're unsure try document, that should work for trying it out
[15:32:29] <ChevyPL> ok thx will try and let you know :)
[15:34:27] <Velveeta> so i have this giant glass mug that i only use on rare occasions, and i wanted something cokey, but i didn't want just coke, so i decided whiskey and coke, but we didn't have regular coke, we had cherry coke, so it's whiskey and cherry coke.. in a gigantic mug
[15:35:07] <Velveeta> and when i started pouring whiskey into it, the bottle was almost empty, so i decided to just kill it and poured the rest in, which almost filled the glass, so i brought it to the couch w/ the cherry coke and my wife was like "DAMN how much whiskey you got?!"
[15:35:26] <Velveeta> and i was like "no no no, see, it's like a long island, just a splash of coke for color" and splashed it
[15:36:49] <grafi> whiskey with cherry coke
[15:36:52] <grafi> oo^
[15:37:05] <grafi> does that actually taste good?
[15:37:10] <Velveeta> it's not *bad*
[15:37:18] <grafi> or cant you tell because you have no coke in there?
[15:37:19] <grafi> :D
[15:37:22] <Velveeta> lol
[15:37:28] <grafi> also: what kind of whiskey?
[15:37:30] <Velveeta> it's that "devil's cut" stuff
[15:37:34] <Velveeta> so it's not terrific on its own
[15:37:51] <grafi> so just the right stuff to mix with coke
[15:38:02] <Velveeta> exactly ;)
[15:42:18] <boytoy> Guys check out my Packery fancy intro: http://jsfiddle.net/desandro/Qd67z/5/

[15:42:57] <boytoy> hehe
[15:43:03] <Velveeta> heheheh
[15:43:12] <Velveeta> it'll take more than this to put me on my ass :D
[15:43:37] <boytoy> ha :)
[15:44:34] <doug65536> boytoy: very nice
[15:45:02] <boytoy> yup
[15:45:11] <boytoy> done by the author himself though
[15:45:12] <boytoy> desandro
[15:46:49] <boytoy> BillCriswell showed me something similar he did yesterday: http://jsbin.com/oFeKUyE/4/edit -- might try to do a little combo there
[15:47:49] <boytoy> i want girls to scream like im justin bieber when they see this
[15:48:10] <ChevyPL> grafi: that works excellent !!!
[15:48:14] <ChevyPL> big thanks!!
[15:48:27] <ChevyPL> <beer>
[15:49:36] <grafi> wohooo
[15:49:37] <grafi> beer
[15:49:38] <grafi> ^^
[15:50:15] <grafi> boytoy is a belieber
[15:51:05] <boytoy> haha
[15:51:06] <boytoy> yes sir
[15:51:11] <boytoy> =)
[15:54:31] <grafi> ugh
[15:54:34] <grafi> you're the worst
[16:02:04] <boytoy> grafi: why? :)
[16:02:24] <grafi> because
[16:04:28] <boytoy> grafi: it's easier getting chicks when you're the only guy in line for justin bieber concerts
[16:04:49] <boytoy> but nah, truth be told, the only time im a belieber is when i see him walking towards the ring with floyd mayweather.. because that's a dude i can believe in
[16:04:54] <grafi> 14 year olds and 40-ish moms?
[16:04:57] <grafi> :o
[16:05:14] <boytoy> lulz
[16:05:23] <grafi> brr
[16:05:52] <boytoy> not all the girls bring their moms
[16:06:07] <boytoy> some bring their big sisters
[16:06:27] <grafi> imo thats not worth it ^^
[16:06:39] <boytoy> more for me
[16:07:47] <grafi> so what does a bieber ticket go for these days? ^^
[16:07:57] <grafi> wouldnt you rather burn your money?
[16:07:57] <grafi> ^^
[16:08:21] <Velveeta> i think it's ridiculous seeing those moms screaming for justin bieber
[16:08:37] <Velveeta> because how would it look for a bunch of 40 year old guys screaming for a 16 year old britney spears or something
[16:09:22] <grafi> exactly the same?
[16:09:52] <Velveeta> yep, but it's somehow more acceptable i think, for the moms screaming for bieber
[16:09:55] <grafi> bieber is 19 though, everything is good :D
[16:10:00] <Velveeta> sure, he is now :D
[16:10:26] <grafi> yeah, because men have better taste in music, than to go to a hannah montana concert
[16:10:27] <Ziber> I'm trying to figure out why an ajax call is raising a JQuery error. http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/ - try entering text in the lists and hitting enter.
[16:11:40] <grafi> whats the error
[16:11:46] <grafi> im getting 200, OK
[16:11:57] <Velveeta> so am i
[16:12:20] <grafi> and its even saving stuff ^^
[16:12:30] <grafi> I think I fixed it
[16:12:34] <grafi> wohoo
[16:12:45] <Velveeta> good goin!
[16:13:11] <Velveeta> now, that being said, nothing's happening for me when i type something in and hit enter
[16:13:11] <Velveeta> i get the 200 OK response, but nothing happens to the list
[16:13:27] <grafi> well when you reload it will
[16:13:36] <Velveeta> fixed it!
[16:13:57] <grafi> xD
[16:14:38] <Ziber> Yes, I want it to happen immediately without refreshes too. But if you see, there's a jquery/ajax break and I'm trying to figure out why.
[16:14:50] <grafi> man the jackal is on tv, such a good movie :P
[16:15:05] <grafi> but nothing breaks :(
[16:15:31] <grafi> Velveeta come to speak of hannah montana ... shes naked now o√¥
[16:15:35] <Ziber> devtools says there's a break.
[16:15:49] <grafi> lemme open up chrome then o√¥
[16:16:46] <grafi> everything 200 OK for me...
[16:16:48] <Velveeta> grafi: yeah she is, lucky wrecking ball
[16:16:58] * Ziber blinks
[16:16:58] <grafi> idk
[16:17:10] <grafi> i think we have another spears situation there
[16:17:15] <Velveeta> ziber: i didn't see an ajax break, but what i did see is that you have no success function to handle the response
[16:17:33] <Velveeta> ziber: i saw a comment-out success function that did a load of some php page
[16:18:21] <Velveeta> actually i see multiple calls to ajax functionality, but am not sure which one is the right now, but can find it in a sec
[16:19:16] <Velveeta> yeah, it's in your initCreate() function, which has a commented out success function
[16:19:26] <Velveeta> so it's just ignoring any response status
[16:19:39] <grafi> na
[16:19:42] <grafi> only the good ones
[16:19:43] <grafi> :P
[16:19:47] <Ziber> http://caton.liber.in/~ziber/drag_ajax_break.png
[16:19:49] <Ziber> You're not seeing that?
[16:20:15] <Velveeta> that's in the bowels of jquery, i don't see an error in that screenshot, just a breakpoint
[16:20:55] <Ziber> Yeah, but isn't that the reason why it's not working?
[16:21:02] <Ziber> also, put the success function back.
[16:21:28] <Velveeta> isn't what the reason why it's not working? i don't see anything wrong in that screenshot, it's just paused in the debugger in a jquery function
[16:21:30] <Ziber> So it works, but not when I have devtools open?
[16:21:44] <grafi> it works everytime xD
[16:22:08] <Ziber> I like how it's multiplying what I'm writing each successive time.
[16:23:35] <Ziber> :)
[16:23:36] <Ziber> see?
[16:23:43] <Velveeta> yeah i see a shit-ton of multiplication
[16:23:53] <Velveeta> that's a metric shit-ton, btw
[16:23:59] <Ziber> course.
[16:24:03] <Ziber> and uh... why the hell?
[16:24:25] <Velveeta> not sure, let me see how many times it's calling certain things
[16:26:00] <Velveeta> so, from a fresh page load, each item i submit in that box yields a multiplier (per submission) of 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 12x
[16:26:25] <Ziber> Yeah.
[16:26:27] <Ziber> No idea why.
[16:26:28] <Velveeta> looks like you have your listeners being bound multiple times when you submit
[16:26:39] <Velveeta> probably from firing your init() function each time you get success
[16:26:44] <Velveeta> init() probably sets up those bindinds
[16:26:48] <Velveeta> bindings*
[16:26:50] <Ziber> I'm also not getting the exact same code on my local copy, which is absurd.
[16:26:57] <clime> hey what is plugin like jquery smooth scroll good for if I can use something like $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $(this.hash).offset().top }, 300);
[16:27:30] <Velveeta> the quick and dirty fix would probably be that in initCreate, you should do a $('#tableContainer').off('keyup') before binding your .on listener
[16:27:37] <Velveeta> to strip any existing keyup listener
[16:27:56] <Velveeta> you should clean it up properly after that, but that's the quick and dirty method to get it to stop stacking those bindings
[16:28:18] <Velveeta> clime: that's an excellent question‚Ä¶.. that's the end of my answer.
[16:28:33] <Velveeta> clime: welcome to the world of questioning the use of plugins that add little if any actual value ;)
[16:28:43] <clime> Velveeta: thanks :)
[16:28:44] <grafi> $(this.hash) probably doesnt exist?
[16:28:50] <Ziber> Velveeta: How would you suggest cleaning up properly?
[16:29:19] <grafi> also that line looks kinda weird
[16:29:23] <Velveeta> ziber: reevaluate firing your init() function as the callback for your ajax success method
[16:29:36] <Velveeta> do you really need to be re-init'ing on every ajax request?
[16:29:44] <grafi> no you dont
[16:30:09] <Ziber> I did that because otherwise the events didn't work after I triggered them once.
[16:30:28] <Velveeta> if that's the case, then something else is going on that needs to be corected
[16:30:31] <Velveeta> corrected*
[16:30:41] <grafi> corected needs to be corrected
[16:30:42] <grafi> :>
[16:31:15] <Velveeta> yeah, colloquy popped up a correction for it and i went "oh yay, it'll autocorrect it when i press enter" ...nope
[16:31:18] <Ziber> And, the problem with the debugger pausing the execution of it is that I can't see the ajax calls/returns to help debug it.
[16:31:22] <Velveeta> autocorrect only works to affect my life negatively
[16:31:47] <Velveeta> ziber: sure you can, set your breakpoint in the success function in your code, that's what i did
[16:32:09] <Ziber> ...How? I'm not terribly familiar with a) what breakpoints are b) how to set them.
[16:32:09] <Velveeta> ziber: set a breakpoint in initCreate inside your keyup listener, and another in the success function, that'll give you a before and after breakpoint
[16:32:21] <Velveeta> what browser are you viewing this in?
[16:32:26] <Ziber> chrome.
[16:32:30] <Ziber> im using devtools.
[16:32:37] <Velveeta> i should totally add an article in my next blog entry on debugging, it's an invaluable skill
[16:32:42] <Velveeta> that's it, that's what i'll write about next
[16:32:58] <Ziber> I know how to debug when doing code... are you just talking around writing like die() statements in code?
[16:32:58] <carpii> has anyone had any experience of mobile browsers which suffer from memory leaks using jquery? Im thinking for a long running web-application where its open for a period of hours all using the same page
[16:32:59] <grafi> javascript debugging
[16:33:05] <Ziber> or did you mean something in devtools?
[16:33:05] <grafi> we should write a book about that
[16:33:07] <Velveeta> ok, so chrome, open your devtools and go to your sources tab and pop out the arrow from the upper left corner
[16:33:28] <grafi> carpii nope
[16:33:29] <Velveeta> go to sandbox.jkode.us/drag/js/(program)
[16:33:50] <Velveeta> and within that, you'll get a view of your page source, plus line numbers in the left column
[16:33:57] <carpii> you can also issue a debugger; command from your javascript. This is useful when script is inserted into the dom (and so chrome only shows it as html and not a debuggable script)
[16:33:57] <doug65536> Ziber:  (you may have to go to the sources tab inside that popout - you do if you have adblock plus)
[16:34:04] <Velveeta> anywhere you want the code to stop (when it hits that point) click the line number for it and it'll set a breakpoint
[16:34:12] <grafi> too
[16:34:12] <grafi> much
[16:34:14] <grafi> help
[16:34:14] <Ziber> okay.
[16:34:16] <grafi> :P
[16:34:35] <grafi> isnt adblock plus evil doug65536 ?
[16:35:00] <doug65536> no, if you don't want your ads blocked, make them non-annoying and get whitelisted
[16:35:07] <Velveeta> damn skippy
[16:35:21] <carpii> isnt adblock plus the one who is started to allow advertisers to pay, to avoid being blocked?
[16:35:25] <grafi> evil as in whitelisting ads from people paying adblock for them?
[16:35:37] <grafi> i thought i read something like that some time ago
[16:35:55] <doug65536> I really don't care if they kill kittens... it blocks commercials in youtube and mostly does what I want :)
[16:35:57] <carpii> me too, but theres various extensions all with similar names
[16:36:15] <Velveeta> whaaaaaaaat, it blocks those friggin youtube commercials?
[16:36:19] <Velveeta> that's it, i'm a convert
[16:36:33] <grafi> fair enough
[16:36:49] <grafi> i have some proxy solution for that, so I dont use it :P
[16:36:53] * Ziber sighs
[16:37:50] <Velveeta> ark starting my debugging post
[16:38:05] <Velveeta> also, grafi, you asked a good question about js debugging vs devtools
[16:38:08] <grafi> debugging my start post
[16:38:14] <doug65536> Velveeta: I'm pretty awesome at debugging, if I do say so myself
[16:38:17] <grafi> me?
[16:38:18] <grafi> when
[16:38:23] <grafi> was I awake then?
[16:38:30] <Ziber> so where do you suggest i put these breakpoints?
[16:38:36] <Velveeta> i'll probably make a generic opening about debugging strategies in general, and then get into some more specific debuggers
[16:38:47] <Velveeta> grafi: sorry, it was yours and ziber's lines mixing together on my screen :D
[16:38:52] <doug65536> Velveeta: I've debugged C++ server apps in stress tests with hundreds of threads in a kernel debugger. web page debugging is a laugh in comparison
[16:38:56] <grafi> phew
[16:39:04] <grafi> I thought I was going crazy
[16:39:05] <grafi> :P
[16:39:05] <Velveeta> grafi: javascript debugging
[16:39:06] <Velveeta> Ziber: or did you mean something in devtools?
[16:39:15] <grafi> haha
[16:39:17] <grafi> yes
[16:39:26] <Velveeta> doug: i'm sure it is, but there are still too many people out there that don't know the tools available to them
[16:39:35] <doug65536> Velveeta: agreed 100%
[16:39:36] <grafi> [01:33:05] <grafi> we should write a book about that
[16:39:39] <carpii> i dont even know what you guys are talking about anymore
[16:39:58] <Velveeta> carpii: we're talking about game of thrones, try to follow along
[16:40:01] <Velveeta> jeez
[16:40:02] <carpii> oic
[16:40:04] <grafi> I mean how many people come in here using alert
[16:40:12] <doug65536> Velveeta: drop me a link if/when that's done, I'd love to give some feedback
[16:40:23] <grafi> also: credit me!
[16:40:24] <grafi> :D
[16:40:29] <carpii> alert has its uses :p
[16:40:30] <Ziber> Well, I've got something. event.keyCode is undefined when I try to match it...

[16:44:10] <grafi> you should start fixing your problem :P
[16:44:43] <Velveeta> ziber: for mouse and key events, jquery uses a 'which' property to try to normalize things like left/right buttons or keyCode vs charCode

[16:45:18] <Velveeta> most people are amazed to find out i actually own the 'velveeta' twitter account :D
[16:45:34] <Ziber> event.which.keyCode?
[16:45:44] <grafi> weird
[16:45:44] <Velveeta> just event.which
[16:45:51] <Ziber> okay.
[16:45:54] <grafi> the search didnt find you

[16:46:01] <Velveeta> http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
[16:46:05] <Ziber> i don't see that in my examination of the event variable.
[16:46:27] <Velveeta> hm, weird
[16:47:13] * Ziber shrugs and tries it
[16:48:23] <Ziber> event.which is undefined.
[16:48:39] <doug65536> Ziber: your callback takes a parameter called event, right?
[16:49:05] <Ziber> i don't that back...
[16:49:07] <Ziber> and yes, it does.
[16:49:09] <doug65536> .on(.... function(event) { ... })
[16:49:20] <Ziber> event.which = 74.
[16:49:54] <Ziber> there, i put it on the sandbox.
[16:52:50] <Ziber> xhr.send( ) has another breakpoint?
[16:53:31] <Ziber> HANG ON.
[16:53:36] <Ziber> I think... I'm beginning to understand this.
[16:54:29] <doug65536> Ziber: I haven't been following, but you know that you can click on the line number in the sources tab to toggle breakpoints right?
[16:54:47] <doug65536> Ziber: it will pause the program when it hits that line
[16:55:51] <Ziber> Yes, I understand how they work now.
[16:55:53] <doug65536> Ziber: and from there you can look at variables by mouseover hover (a tooltip will come up) or, you can highlight expressions and right click it and pick "evaluate in console"
[16:55:58] <Ziber> Right yeah.
[16:56:13] <Ziber> What I don't understand is why the callback function isn't loading the tables again as it should.
[16:56:16] <doug65536> or you can go over to console window and type in stuff to check, even selectors
[16:56:28] <grafi> loading the tables again o√¥
[16:56:39] <grafi> oh my
[16:58:38] <Ziber> :/
[16:59:16] <grafi> :)
[17:00:11] <Ziber> any thoughts to why the .load() isn't working? because obviously when reloaded on refresh, it's worked.
[17:02:32] <Ziber> ...
[17:02:54] <Ziber> Why the hell is it working on the sandbox when it's not working on my local code and it's exactly the same code?
[17:03:58] <doug65536> Ziber: obviously something is wrong/different
[17:05:33] <Ziber> Nothing can be different. This is a git controlled environment. I make a change, look at it locally, push it. Once pushed, it deploys to the web...
[17:06:29] <carpii> well something is different, else it would work
[17:08:34] <Ziber> It can't be.
[17:08:49] <carpii> theres no black magic in software :)
[17:09:03] <carpii> if its not working, then theres a reason for it. dont you agree?
[17:10:23] <Velveeta> oo! oo! i agree! oo! pick me!
[17:10:26] * Ziber sighs.
[17:10:30] <grafi> yes Velveeta
[17:10:34] <grafi> what is it
[17:10:35] <grafi> :P
[17:10:36] <Velveeta> i agree!
[17:10:38] <Velveeta> :D
[17:10:40] <grafi> ^^
[17:10:43] <carpii> :p
[17:10:59] <carpii> Ziber, what aspect of load() isnt working for you?
[17:11:18] <Velveeta> now, i'll say that there can be some performance differences between local code and production code, based on environment alone, even if the code is identical
[17:11:39] <Ziber> carpii: When I create a new list item on the sandbox version, and I hit enter, it shows up in the list. When I do that locally, it does not.
[17:11:43] <Velveeta> but that's generally only if you're referencing local assets in a local context and deploy to a production environment where they're not available
[17:11:52] <carpii> whats the sandbox version?
[17:12:03] <Velveeta> e.g. referencing something like /assets/css/blah.css or localhost/images/blah.png
[17:12:03] <Ziber> http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/
[17:12:10] <Ziber> Velveeta: I understand, and I'm not.
[17:12:14] <Velveeta> and maybe you should be referencing a can instead
[17:12:17] <Velveeta> cdn*
[17:13:08] <carpii> so you issue an ajax call to item_cerate, and then request the full table again via dynamic_tables.php ?
[17:13:34] <Ziber> Yes,.
[17:13:56] <carpii> but on localhost, dynamic_tables returns the same resultset even after the item was cerated?
[17:15:13] <Ziber> Yes.
[17:15:19] <abjorn> oh god i cant possibly finish all these cajun fries from five guys...theres...theres too many
[17:15:35] <Ziber> I confirmed that by running $("span.outer").load('dynamic_tables.php'); in the console.
[17:15:35] <carpii> so the first thing to check, is that the item_cerate is actually creating an entry in database, when issued from localhost
[17:15:47] <Ziber> *create
[17:15:51] <Ziber> and i'll check.
[17:15:59] <Enissay> Hi guys, I'm creating a table using var table_obj = $('<table>', {id: tableID}); then I add rows correctly, but I couldnt find how to add a <thead> node to my table... any suggestion please ?
[17:16:07] <Ziber> Also, just for proof:
[17:16:08] <Ziber> [ziber@caton] (~) $ diff -u sandbox.drag/ user_web/drag/
[17:16:11] <Ziber> Only in user_web/drag/: colorbox
[17:16:14] <Ziber> Only in user_web/drag/: Drag.sql
[17:16:16] <Ziber> Only in user_web/drag/: .git
[17:16:19] <Ziber> Common subdirectories: sandbox.drag/images and user_web/drag/images
[17:16:21] <Ziber> Common subdirectories: sandbox.drag/js and user_web/drag/js
[17:16:24] <Ziber> sandbox.drag/ is the webroot folder, user_web/drag/ is my local code.
[17:16:26] <carpii> means nothing to me Ziber
[17:16:28] <Velveeta> abjorn: i've had 5 guys exactly one time in my life
[17:16:37] <Velveeta> and i have to say, it was pretty frigging delicious
[17:16:40] <abjorn> ya
[17:16:40] <carpii> i dont think anyone is suggesting the live code differs form localhost
[17:16:43] <abjorn> those cajun fries bro
[17:16:46] <abjorn> i mean, the burgers too
[17:16:52] <Velveeta> but wahat wasn't delicious was the $12 bill for my double-cheeseburger, fries and drink
[17:17:00] <abjorn> yeaaaah
[17:17:13] <abjorn> i think its cause they give you an entire fucking bad of fries
[17:17:16] <abjorn> *bag
[17:17:17] <Velveeta> that's really the only thing that kept me from going back
[17:17:27] <Ziber> [20:15:35] < carpii> so the first thing to check, is that the item_cerate is actually creating an entry in database, when issued from  localhost <-- It is. Because when I refresh the page, it shows up.
[17:17:35] <Velveeta> lol, well in my case it wasn't, it wasn't even the size of like a wendy's great biggie fries
[17:17:50] <abjorn> at least around here, though, that's par for course if you're not getting cheap fast food like mcdonalds
[17:19:06] <Velveeta> dem mcdonald's fries, though
[17:19:32] <Velveeta> pretty much every other thing on their menu is awful‚Ä¶. except i do have the occasional guilty-pleasure-craving for a big mac, or a sausage biscuit at breakfasttime
[17:19:41] <Velveeta> but their fries are pretty good
[17:19:45] <doug65536> Velveeta: lol, "had 5 guys"... I'll let you guess how I interpreted that at first
[17:20:20] <doug65536> ..."it was delicious"
[17:20:23] <abjorn> five guys cajun fries best fries N/A
[17:20:42] <Velveeta> doug: i'm gonna guess that how you interpreted that was like "had 5 guys come in my back door, because it's the one that's always open, and come in my man cave, because it's the hot spot that nobody ever wants to leave, but eventually has to pull out of"
[17:21:01] <abjorn> this went to a place that i never intended
[17:21:04] <Velveeta> andre-from-the-league-interpretation for the win!
[17:21:12] <doug65536> seriously, I did an emergency re-read of that sentence and its context :P
[17:21:43] <Velveeta> i guess there are no fans of the league in here then :D
[17:22:05] <Velveeta> if not, you should totally watch it, it's available on netflix streaming
[17:22:29] <Ziber> So, it's been confirmed. It does actually create the entry.
[17:22:35] <carpii> Ziber, so if the item is being created in the database, then the request for the full table dta is not working properly. Its possibly being cached on the webserver, or maybe even the backend
[17:23:09] <carpii> try adding a timestamp parameter to your 'get full table data' api, just as a quick way to bypassing any httpd caching
[17:23:23] <Enissay> Please, How to set the <thead> part of my new created table  $('<table'); ?
[17:23:33] <Ziber> Isn't there a header I can set for no cache?
[17:23:56] <carpii> yes, you already set it from what i can see
[17:24:02] <carpii> but that doesnt mean the httpd is respecting it
[17:24:12] <Velveeta> enissay: we're gonna need more information than that, buddy
[17:24:12] <carpii> especially since it works on live but not on dev
[17:24:38] <carpii> alternatively change your api script to always return an empty table, and then try adding a new item
[17:24:53] <Ziber> always return an empty one?
[17:25:19] <Velveeta> this channel is such a wealth of critical thinkers, i wish you guys lived in austin so i could poach you for my company and get the referral bonuses :D
[17:25:26] <doug65536> Enissay: something like var tbl = $('<table/>'); var thead = $('<thead/>); tbl.append(thead); var row = $('<tr/>'); row.append($('<td/>').text('Cell!')); thead.append(row); ...
[17:25:42] <Velveeta> especially you, doug
[17:25:58] <Velveeta> any interest in relocating? ;)
[17:26:00] <doug65536> thanks :)
[17:26:18] <carpii> no job offer for me ?! :(
[17:26:37] <Velveeta> sorry carpii, i haven't seen much out of you, but you seem to have a solid head on your shoulders so far ;)
[17:26:44] <Velveeta> why, do YOU have an interest in it? :D
[17:26:52] <carpii> hehe ok thanks
[17:26:52] <doug65536> Enissay: although I probably wouldn't really do it that way - just directly answering the question
[17:27:05] <carpii> nope, not really. i left the 9-5 years ago and no intention of going back
[17:27:09] <carpii> so i was just teasing :p
[17:27:23] <Velveeta> let me tell you something‚Ä¶ i was a fucking badass before i came to this company‚Ä¶ and as much of a badass as i was, i realized almost right off the bat just how little i knew, and how much opportunity there still was *for* me to learn, it's been awesome
[17:27:32] <Ziber> Debating taking a break from this for dinner... I just can't figure out how the hell this is happening.
[17:27:41] <doug65536> Enissay: I prefer to let the html be the html and do selective cloning
[17:27:42] <Velveeta> it's literally like working side by side with paul irish or john resig, our FEE team constantly keeps each other on our toes
[17:27:48] <carpii> Ziber, it doesnt seem that difficult to me
[17:28:08] <carpii> Velveeta: thats cool. nothing like working in a progressive environment
[17:28:34] <Velveeta> ziber: sometimes taking a break *is* the answer‚Ä¶ you wouldn't believe how many breakthrough's i've had by just taking an hour or 2 away, or sleeping on it, and revisiting later with a fresh perspective after things have time to sink in
[17:29:12] <Ziber> carpii: I guess I'm just not understanding them.
[17:29:16] <Ziber> s/them/then/g
[17:29:19] <Velveeta> carpii: definitely, it's one of the main reasons i still love my job after 2 years at this company‚Ä¶ let's face it, in this line of work, there's very little holding a person to a given company for any length of time, anything over a year is almost considered 'stable'
[17:29:31] <doug65536> Velveeta: you were experiencing this before: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect
[17:29:39] <Velveeta> the market for front end engineers is hot right now, and has been for the last few years in general
[17:29:42] <carpii> Ziber, i thought we were making progress tbh. You just need to identify whether the backend script is returning stale results
[17:29:58] <carpii> or whether your client script is taking accurate results and failing to present them properly
[17:30:14] <Velveeta> carpii: absolutely: if you look at the very first post on my blog, one of the things i point out is how people overvalue their own skill set a lot of the time these days
[17:30:42] <carpii> velveeta, yeah frontend is not a common skill for good devs. Most devs can bosh together an interface but it often looks crappy and no respect to usability
[17:31:08] <Ziber> carpii: We have made progress. And the only thing dynamic_tables does is to issue an SQL select and build the tables.
[17:31:11] <Velveeta> we used to ask people to rate themselves in various categories, like native js vs jquery specifically, with 1 being "i think i heard of that term once" and 10 being "i could write the spec from memory right now"‚Ä¶ you wouldn't believe how many 8+'s we got, which, by the end of an hour of us tearing them apart in an interview, would reevaluate themselves more like a 3-4 :D
[17:31:14] <Ziber> no place to cache.
[17:31:35] <carpii> ok, but use Chromes web inspector to check if the actual http response includes your new item
[17:31:49] <doug65536> Velveeta: just test their knowledge of closures up front. if they don't get that, they are not competent
[17:32:01] <carpii> if it doesnt, then backend is caching. if it does, then your response parser is fubarred
[17:32:06] <Velveeta> doug: that's literally the 1st or 2nd question i usually ask a person
[17:32:18] <Enissay> Velveeta, doug65536 , was trying to give you more info... This is how i'm doing so far : http://pastebin.com/NtkHVgja
[17:32:31] <doug65536> Enissay: oh sorry, I missed it
[17:32:54] <Velveeta> i did too, looking at the link now
[17:33:10] <Velveeta> enissay: in my defense, i have 85% of a giant mug of whiskey in me by now
[17:33:16] <Velveeta> doug‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. has no defense
[17:33:27] <doug65536> lol
[17:33:27] <Enissay> lol
[17:33:52] <Velveeta> enissay: i see nothing in that code block about a thead element
[17:34:44] <Enissay> Velveeta, that's what' i'm trying to add... I tried many ways with no success... i'm trying now what doug suggested
[17:35:03] <doug65536> Enissay: I have doubts about the html: in line 15
[17:35:07] <Ziber> How do you get a timestamp in JS?
[17:35:10] <doug65536> Enissay: what is that supposed to do?
[17:35:10] <Ziber> time()?
[17:35:40] <Enissay> doug65536, apparently the same as  .text('xx')
[17:35:52] <Velveeta> doug: what's your doubt about that line? (15)
[17:36:10] <Velveeta> i don't see that format often, but it looks correct
[17:36:11] <doug65536> Enissay: ah neat. haven't tried that before
[17:36:16] <doug65536> nevermind
[17:36:23] <Velveeta> yeah, it's not one i use personally
[17:36:28] <Velveeta> but i think it does actually work
[17:36:31] <carpii> Ziber, if you change your load() to use ajax() instead, you can pass a cache: false option
[17:36:33] <doug65536> it does
[17:36:38] <Velveeta> so as for the thead part
[17:36:41] <carpii> which automatically adds a ?ts=463576437 param
[17:36:43] <Velveeta> *what* do you want to be in the thead?
[17:36:46] <doug65536> I stay away from html as much as possible. XSS security hole
[17:36:56] <carpii> atucally its ?_=748975489 not ts=
[17:36:59] <carpii> actually
[17:37:05] <Velveeta> doug: *that* one i'm not familiar with, can you explain?
[17:37:44] <doug65536> Velveeta: if you put user-entered content in a page, using .html, then they could "steal cookies" or do other nasty things, by posting something with a <script> tag
[17:38:13] <doug65536> so whenever possible, I use .text instead of .html
[17:38:40] <Velveeta> interesting‚Ä¶ i rarely actually use text‚Ä¶ but i also rarely ever inject unsanitized user content
[17:38:42] <doug65536> that user entered content would put that script tag in all viewer's pages...
[17:38:49] <Velveeta> in fact in my current role, i never do
[17:39:00] <Velveeta> so yeah, it's good to see multiple perspectives on development
[17:39:05] <Ziber> carpii: .ajax({ load: 'url', cache: false })?
[17:39:15] <doug65536> so it could send the PHPSESSID cookie or something to some malicious server
[17:39:17] <Ziber> I've got it working, appended my own ?ts=
[17:39:24] <carpii> ok, thats good enough
[17:39:37] <carpii> so adding ts= results in an accurate dataset being returned ?
[17:39:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey is there anyway using jquery/css to either: set an inputs max-width or on resize adjust the size (the width) to the container width
[17:39:49] <Ziber> yeah, working now.
[17:40:04] <carpii> ok Ziber, so development httpd is preferring to return a cached http response
[17:40:07] <doug65536> Enissay: you don't append that fragment to the page itself
[17:40:21] <Ziber> interesting. no idea why.
[17:40:49] <HD|Laptop> Hey
[17:40:53] <doug65536> Enissay: you need to .append or .insertBefore or something, it
[17:41:05] <HD|Laptop> How do I enable user/password autofill for fully AJAX-submitted login forms like on http://dtmp.vm-dg.de/rss/#op/login ?
[17:41:08] <doug65536> Enissay: into the page
[17:41:33] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: you can set a max-width with css...
[17:41:38] <Enissay> doug65536, that's what i'm trying to do... but when I display the html in console, it gives my only the tbody part... Is that normal ?
[17:41:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i know i tried but still not wokring
[17:41:57] <Enissay> doug65536, yes I know, still testing for now
[17:42:03] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: and, optionally, you could set its with to 100%, or on resize, calculate its parent's width and statically set its width based on that
[17:42:11] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: how did you try it?
[17:42:42] <Velveeta> hd|laptop: hey backatcha
[17:43:15] <doug65536> Enissay: I wouldn't expect that... let me try in console
[17:43:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/pF2tC/
[17:45:20] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: ok, so i'm looking at this, can you give me a workflow to follow to recreate your problem?
[17:45:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> i tried using max width on the input
[17:46:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> and after that didnt work
[17:46:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> i used width
[17:46:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> and tried using the window resize event to trigger the change in width of the input
[17:46:29] <Velveeta> oh ok, so i need to resize this thing
[17:46:31] <Velveeta> one sec
[17:49:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> k
[17:50:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: ping me when you got something
[17:51:52] <Velveeta> sorry, the wife was looking at a bunch of star wars costume fails and it was hard for me to divert my eyes.. i'm now into your code, i promise :D
[17:52:09] <Enissay> Velveeta, doug65536, the thead is added correctly http://pastebin.com/NtkHVgja ... but is the output correct ? how can I display the full code including <table> nodes ?
[17:52:22] <Velveeta> so first tell me the goal of those‚Ä¶ you ant the inputs to be what, 100% of their available width?
[17:54:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: yes
[17:55:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> if you see the orginal fiddle i gave you and resize the preview window
[17:55:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> you will see that the select "inputs" work fine
[17:55:26] <Velveeta> right, so it looks like the form container itself doesn't necessarily resize
[17:55:48] <Velveeta> ok, so yeah, the inputs looked fine enough, what was the problem you were trying to solve in that case?
[17:58:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> the inputs dont resize
[17:58:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> the select menu does but the inputs dont
[17:58:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> try a window width under 430px
[17:58:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> and you will see
[17:58:40] <Velveeta> ok thanks
[17:58:45] <Enissay> Velveeta, doug65536, nvm, found it, it was a bit tricky.. thks guys <3
[17:58:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> the selects resize the inputs dont
[17:59:30] <Velveeta> they do for me, in chrome anyway, what browser are you in?
[18:00:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> chrome beta
[18:00:47] <Velveeta> damn, i'm in chrome too, can you screenshot what you're seeing?
[18:00:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait a sec
[18:00:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> it is responding
[18:01:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold on is there anyway to add some margn on the right side
[18:01:39] <Velveeta> one sec
[18:02:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> the select menus have that margin
[18:02:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> but the inputs arent getting it
[18:03:16] <Velveeta> ok gotcha, i think i know what you're talking about
[18:03:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[18:10:52] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: here's where i would start: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4073768/how-to-get-equal-width-of-input-and-select-fields
[18:11:41] <Velveeta> and for everyone else‚Ä¶ that bigass glass mug i've been referencing, full of whiskey, here it is pressed up against the side of my skull for size comparison‚Ä¶ http://i.imgur.com/EpI1PMB.jpg ‚Ä¶also, here's a picture of my bigass skull‚Ä¶ time for round 2...
[18:12:53] <carpii> that is surely huge for a whisky glass
[18:12:59] <carpii> unless youve a really tiny head
[18:13:45] <Velveeta> to be fair, i'm a wood nymph
[18:13:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: got it used padding on the contianer
[18:14:09] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: ahhhhh good call :)
[18:14:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks for the help
[18:18:52] <doug65536> Velveeta: lol, my alcohol tolerance is very low. I would be hammered after drinking that much :D
[18:19:08] <Velveeta> my liver likes to swim :D
[18:20:17] <carpii> i can drink whisky and beer like water, but a few glasses of red wine and im ready to projectile vomit
[18:20:31] <Velveeta> well that's entirely different‚Ä¶ wine is disgusting :D
[18:20:48] <carpii> heh yeah, it is. but for the alcohol content, it doesnt make sense
[18:20:51] <Velveeta> my wife and i have had exactly 1 awesome wine experience
[18:21:13] <carpii> and the worst hangovers ever form wine, too
[18:21:19] <Velveeta> it was in a steakhouse in vegas, we had a hotel offer for a complimentary bottle of wine, and it paired perfectly with the meal
[18:21:22] <Enissay> Is there a way to use partially variable variables =D ... I mean var VARxxx;  where the xxx part can change in a loop ?
[18:21:34] <Velveeta> we tried, many many times, to recreate that experience upon arriving back home.. we never could
[18:21:37] <carpii> enissay, no that doesnt make sense
[18:21:43] <carpii> use an array
[18:21:51] <carpii> velveeta, which vegas restaurant ?
[18:21:54] <carpii> i love vegas
[18:22:15] <doug65536> Enissay: if you mean property names, you can. there's a way if you *really* had to. I won't mention its evil name
[18:23:10] <Enissay> yea, nvm, i'll do it in a different way <3
[18:23:40] <doug65536> js> var test = { something: 5 }; var name = "something"; print(test[name])
[18:23:47] <b-ot> doug65536: 5
[18:23:54] <Velveeta> carpii: this was at the flame restaurant at el cortez
[18:24:24] <carpii> ah, i dont know it :/
[18:24:32] <carpii> uk here, but visit vegas every year
[18:29:59] <Velveeta> carpii: we try to visit each year, but we like to really gamble it up when we go, which means we really have to save up for when we go :)
[18:30:37] <carpii> yeah me too :)
[18:30:53] <carpii> i normally stay at a villa right by the mountains in the northeast
[18:31:11] <carpii> but this year i got a penthouse suite for 5 days, and then MGM skylofts for 2 days
[18:31:24] <carpii> i think ill do the same from now on, it was pretty awesome
[18:34:24] <Velveeta> holy shit, nice score :D
[18:34:49] <carpii> hehe yeah, its about as luxury as it gets. not cheap though
[18:34:51] <Velveeta> we got an upgraded suite at bellagio for our last visit, with $300 in free dining credit and $300 in free play credit
[18:35:02] <Velveeta> but i would love to land a sky loft for a weekend :D
[18:35:06] <carpii> how is bellagio, ive looked at it in the past
[18:35:19] <Velveeta> we almost made it to platinum on this past visit, we were literally like 6000 point shy of it or something
[18:35:26] <carpii> mgm are not very generous when it comes to free gaming credits
[18:35:30] <carpii> oof
[18:35:41] <Velveeta> bellagio was nice for what we had, which was a slightly-above-average suite, so i can only imagine their nicer suites are‚Ä¶ well.. nicer
[18:36:22] <carpii> mgm skylofts are more expensive than their skyline terrace suite, but terrace suite is much nice
[18:36:27] <carpii> just you dont get a butler :(((
[18:37:03] <carpii> thanks, going again in march so Ill look into bellagio
[18:38:50] <Velveeta> i've seen some videos of their sky lofts, and they look pretty sweet.. (suite?) i don't know what i'd do with a butler, except to make him strictly into a bartender :D
[18:39:37] <carpii> ah mostly they just come in very silently and leave little chocolates and stuff
[18:39:47] <carpii> often youre playing pool and theyre in and out and you never realise theyve been
[18:39:54] <carpii> until suddenly theres some treats on the table
[18:40:07] <carpii> they have a secret door which they enter through :p
[18:40:32] <carpii> you can make special requests for stuff, but theres nothing we really wanted
[18:41:07] <carpii> and i imagine if you requested something itd be really expensive, its designed for rock stars with no concept of money i think :D
[18:47:25] <Velveeta> carpii: yeah, i most definitely have a concept of money, i just realize that i'm more-than-likely gonna be throwing it away in my visit :D
[18:47:40] <carpii> oh i wasn't saying you didnt :)
[18:47:43] <carpii> but yeah im the same
[18:47:52] <carpii> i go to vegas intent on spending a load of money and njoying it
[18:47:59] <carpii> rather than trying to gamble and walk away a winner
[18:48:23] <carpii> last time i visited sky combat ace, which lets you dogfight in a plane with your freind
[18:48:29] <carpii> was amazing :)
[18:48:34] <carpii> http://www.skycombatace.com/
[18:49:06] <carpii> do you know of any downtown casinos which are worth a visit ?
[18:51:58] <Velveeta> carpii: i actually prefer the downtown casinos to the strip casinos‚Ä¶ the strip ones are definitely more flashy, and have more eye candy ;) but the downtown casinos have more down to earth people and looser odds :D
[18:52:08] <carpii> yeah i agree
[18:52:15] <carpii> ive been to a few downtown and enjoyed them
[18:53:03] <carpii> but only about two or three, i suspect theres better ones we missed
[18:56:06] <Velveeta> so, my personal favorites downtown are the golden nugget, las vegas club, and el cortez (admittedly a more seedy casino, but i still love it)
[18:56:20] <carpii> cool thanks
[18:56:30] <carpii> been to golden nugget, the other two are new to me :)
[18:56:32] <Velveeta> i also used to love going to the fits on fremont, but they've since been bought out and renovated and remodeled into "The D" which i have yet to revisit, so i can't speak as to that
[18:57:12] <carpii> you go to vegas for vacation, or live closeby?
[18:57:14] <Velveeta> the las vegas club is on the "top" end of fremont street? i don't know if that's n/s/e/w but it's the farthest in, opposite end from binions and the heart attack grill :D
[18:57:25] <Velveeta> el cortez is about a block away from fremont, on 6th street
[18:57:36] <Velveeta> we live in texas, so we go there for vacation
[18:58:07] <Velveeta> our last trip was very much a compressed gambling trip, we left on a friday evening at like 8pm, came back sunday morning at 7am, spent about 8k in that 36 hours or so
[18:58:26] <Velveeta> mostly in bellagio, but also went across the street to paris
[18:59:01] <Velveeta> it hurt, coming back minus most of that‚Ä¶ but it was a fun weekend :D
[18:59:48] <Velveeta> like you said, we have to factor it in as entertaining fee vs actually trying to use it to "earn" money, it hurts less that way :)
[19:00:22] <carpii> hehe yea
[19:00:55] <carpii> oof, 8k in 36 hours
[19:01:00] <Velveeta> yuuuuup
[19:01:05] <carpii> i thought i was a big gambler, but ive not hit those figures yet :p
[19:01:20] <carpii> i did plant $1000 on a blackjack hand, and won though
[19:01:26] <carpii> table went crazy, which was fun
[19:01:35] <Velveeta> yeah, we don't have legal gambling in texas, so our closest casino is around 4-5 hours away in neighboring states if we drive
[19:01:47] <Velveeta> oh man i *bet* that table went crazy :D
[19:02:01] <Velveeta> my biggest blackjack win so far was $360 on a switch 21 table
[19:02:01] <carpii> we have casinos in uk, but theyre very low key, populated by bums and the dregs of society
[19:02:12] <carpii> not much fun at all
[19:02:29] <carpii> i wanted to take a pic of my stack, but the grumpy croupier said no :(
[19:02:39] <Velveeta> i remember when i first went to a casino, i was like "whaaaaat? who can play $5 a spin?! $25 a hand?! richies!"
[19:02:40] <carpii> security reasons i guess
[19:02:46] <carpii> aha
[19:02:51] <Velveeta> and now i *start* at $25 a hand and $5-10 per spin on slots :D
[19:03:06] <carpii> i like the people sitting on the $10 slots, just pressing buttons and not talking to anyone
[19:03:09] <Velveeta> as you get to be more and more comfortable with the concept of gambling, you get more ballsy :D
[19:03:16] <carpii> yea :)
[19:03:42] <carpii> i seem to play blackjack for a while and tread water, then get more ballsy and start making big bets
[19:03:46] <carpii> gradually losing money
[19:03:54] <carpii> then hit roulette where i win loads then lose it all :D
[19:04:03] <carpii> and go to bed happy and drunk
[19:04:10] <Velveeta> heheheh
[19:04:15] <Velveeta> man, roulette always eats my money
[19:04:28] <carpii> hehe yeah, it can be brutal sometimes
[19:04:29] <Velveeta> it's not so bad on the electronic tables where it's easier to make neighbor bets
[19:04:41] <Velveeta> trying to figure that stuff out on a legitimate table is a pain in the ass
[19:04:42] <carpii> and i dont like electronic tables much
[19:04:52] <carpii> just toss the chips to the dealer and ask them to place them
[19:04:59] <Velveeta> lol
[19:05:00] <carpii> so long as youre polite theyre fine with it
[19:05:07] <Velveeta> i suppose that's one way :D
[19:05:12] <carpii> hehe
[19:05:15] <carpii> they dont mind, really
[19:05:19] <Velveeta> we actually have decent luck w/ that kind of strategy with scratchoffs
[19:05:21] <carpii> better than reaching over and pushing people out the way
[19:05:28] <carpii> which a lot of people seem to do
[19:05:30] <Velveeta> we'll tell the person at the gas station "just pick us out a couple of $10's tickets"
[19:05:42] <Velveeta> that's another reason i hate roulette, and craps
[19:05:46] <Velveeta> that shoulder-to-shoulder aspect
[19:06:09] <Velveeta> especially because most people in the casino have been in there way too many hours, reeking of smoke and sweat, and with no shower
[19:06:47] <carpii> hehe yea
[19:07:03] <Velveeta> i like to think that at some point, we'll sell this house and retire to vegas
[19:07:23] <Velveeta> but then i also think that i'm gonna be on the corner by the end of the first week, selling my body for $5 a pop to go win it all back with
[19:08:07] <carpii> heh
[19:08:13] <carpii> i sometimes think id love to live in vegas
[19:08:15] <carpii> but at the same time
[19:08:21] <carpii> i know it would destroy me utterly
[19:08:29] <Velveeta> i have an aunt and uncle that live out there
[19:08:36] <Velveeta> but that's mostly because he's an autograph-hound
[19:08:40] <carpii> cool
[19:08:50] <carpii> though i think most vegas residents tend to avoid the strip anyway
[19:08:51] <Velveeta> he literally moved out there just for the opportunities to get autographs, his collection is like 2000+
[19:08:57] <carpii> wow nice
[19:09:04] <Velveeta> yeah most residents do avoid the strip
[19:09:19] <Velveeta> and he doesn't gamble often, he does walk the strip though, for opportunities :D
[19:09:37] <Velveeta> now, our last visit, we hired an escapade to take us to the airport at 5:30 in the morning
[19:09:59] <Velveeta> and our driver, we were spilling our guts to him, and he said that him and his wife had retired out to vegas for the same reasons, they loved gambling
[19:10:33] <carpii> i think it could be ok if you had the willpower to limit it
[19:10:36] <carpii> but i know i havent
[19:10:44] <Velveeta> he said it takes a little while to get into your groove, but once you figure it out, they routinely gambling on the weekends, at off-strip properties, and have such high points at those places that they get regular offers for dining, free play, events, etc
[19:11:08] <carpii> hm yeah, a lot of the less popular places could be good for that
[19:11:15] <Velveeta> and a lot of their weekends are entirely paid for in a lot of cases, sometimes with profit
[19:11:27] <carpii> lower table limits and more focused on turning over than rollercoaster up and downs :)
[19:11:53] <Velveeta> he said they get to eat for free a lot of the time, and go dancing and whatnot, and come out $1-200 up at the end of a weekend, so it's free play and entertainment plus a small amount of cash, which is a win overall
[19:12:37] <Velveeta> i have one friend that's *only* interested in poker tables.. if a casino doesn't offer poker tables, he doesn't want em..
[19:12:44] <Velveeta> i find that too narrow-sighted
[19:13:19] <Velveeta> i enjoy gambling for the thrill, no matter the game, there are some games i like less than others, like pai gow (the bonus bet pays in quarters? wtf kind of game is this?!)
[19:13:40] <Velveeta> but i sure as hell wouldn't write off a property just because they didn't have a poker room, and when they do have one, spend 100% of my time in it
[19:14:12] <carpii> oh wow, i love pai gow
[19:14:15] <Velveeta> for one thing, i think people like that see themselves like some kind of super-poker-gurus, like fucking Rounders or something
[19:14:30] <carpii> hehe yea
[19:14:36] <Velveeta> let me tell you guy, if you're that good at poker, you should be playing wsop, not private rooms
[19:14:36] <carpii> i dont bet the bonus in pai gow much though
[19:14:45] <carpii> its mostly a game where you just gently turn over oney, a bit like blackjack
[19:14:51] <carpii> except slightly more volatile
[19:15:00] <carpii> wuldnt expect to win big on it, or lose much either
[19:15:08] <Velveeta> right, a lot of card games are the kinds of games you can go up and down over a long period of time without a lot of turnover in your bankroll
[19:15:12] <carpii> yea
[19:15:17] <Velveeta> that's what i love about the tables in general
[19:15:20] <carpii> good for just having a drink and enjoying the ride
[19:15:30] <Velveeta> i can get my gambling fix over a long period for not a lot of money at the end of it all
[19:15:35] <carpii> which is why i leave roulette till last
[19:15:40] <Velveeta> and on occasion, i can have an awesome win
[19:15:47] <carpii> because it can be brutal if you hit a bad streak
[19:16:00] <Velveeta> i had a $3500 win a let it ride table once, it.. was.. *awesome* :D
[19:16:20] <Velveeta> caught a 4 of a kind, with a $25 bet on each circle, paid 50:1
[19:17:01] <carpii> wow nice
[19:17:11] <Velveeta> yeah‚Ä¶ those are few and far between of course
[19:17:20] <Velveeta> but when they hit, oh *man* do they feel great :D
[19:17:27] <carpii> you need a big bank for let it ride really
[19:17:37] <carpii> even though it doesnt go up and down lots
[19:17:51] <carpii> a few bad hands can eat away loads
[19:18:03] <Velveeta> i enjoy let it ride for the opposite reason, i don't think you need a huge bank for it, because you can pull back to 1 unit if you have to on each hand
[19:18:16] <carpii> i was playing let it ride in a uk casino, and i overheard the dealer say to the pit boss
[19:18:17] <Velveeta> i'll tell you one of my favorite games though, is mississippi stud, ever played it?
[19:18:28] <carpii> 'i just paid 3-1 for a flush, and that guy didnt even complaint'
[19:18:41] <carpii> no i dont know mississipi stud
[19:19:08] <Velveeta> so with mississippi stud, it's kind of the opposite of let it ride
[19:19:16] <Velveeta> instead of paying everything up front and retracting your bets...
[19:19:27] <Velveeta> you pay 1 unit up front and have to buy in for each additional card
[19:20:00] <Velveeta> the awesome thing though, is that at any time, you can triple up the rest of your bets, so if you know you have at least a push hand, you can triple up all the rest of your bets
[19:20:25] <Velveeta> so if you put out, say, $25 on the ante, and you get dealt pocket 6's, 6's-10's are a push, so you know you can't lose
[19:20:45] <Velveeta> so you can then put out $75 on each of your next 3 bets, and hope either the community cards pair up or have a 6 and give you trips
[19:21:06] <Velveeta> the problem with mississippi stud, though, is that you end up chasing a lot of losing hands
[19:21:32] <carpii> cool
[19:21:34] <Velveeta> you may get dealt like an A-K, and think "i *can't* fold these" and chase it through to the end at 1 unit, and have a 2/3/4 come up on the board, and get nothing
[19:21:36] <carpii> i dont think ive seen that game anywhere
[19:21:43] <carpii> im guesing its more downtown ?
[19:21:56] <Velveeta> so, mississippi stud i don't see often in vegas properties
[19:21:59] <carpii> strip just focuses on games which reap the most profit i think :p
[19:22:09] <Velveeta> we typically only get to play it in louisiana when we drive to those casinos
[19:22:14] <carpii> ah
[19:22:29] <carpii> i noticed strip seems to be focusing a lot more on slots this year than recent years
[19:22:31] <Velveeta> yeah the strip gives a lot of the most popular games, like 13 different varieties of blackjack
[19:22:42] <Velveeta> and let it ride, 3- and 4-card poker
[19:22:44] <carpii> not that surprising, given that its where they make the most profit
[19:22:50] <Velveeta> yepyep
[19:23:02] <carpii> but lots of tables full, and empty thables they werent opening
[19:23:27] <Velveeta> yeah i hate when they won't open new tables when their current tables are full
[19:23:32] <carpii> yea
[19:23:35] <Velveeta> because, like i said, i hate being shoulder to shoulder :D
[19:23:45] <Velveeta> it probably goes back to the fact that i'm a programmer and an introvert ;)
[19:23:47] <carpii> or they open them with stupid limits, like $50 blackjack
[19:23:54] <Velveeta> right
[19:23:58] <carpii> while the table next to it is full on $10 bj
[19:24:10] <Velveeta> i don't mind going *up* to $50 a hand on blackjack, but i hate it being the minimum
[19:24:16] <carpii> yea me too
[19:24:21] <Velveeta> i don't mind a $25 minimum and then playing $50
[19:24:22] <carpii> i like the option
[19:24:29] <Velveeta> but it hurts sitting at a $50 min table
[19:24:37] <carpii> and even the table limit, i play for a few hands then start increasing normally
[19:24:44] <Velveeta> right
[19:25:00] <carpii> but you know as soon as you sit at a $50 bj table
[19:25:05] <carpii> your first 10 hands are gonna suck :p
[19:25:09] <Velveeta> oh god yes
[19:25:11] <carpii> hehe
[19:25:21] <Velveeta> it's just like when you sit at any table minimum, and slowly work your way up
[19:25:25] <carpii> yea
[19:25:28] <Velveeta> as soon as you start playing outside your comfort zone
[19:25:32] <Velveeta> they eat it all
[19:25:45] <Velveeta> i'll sit at a $25 table and do great, raise it to $50, then $75, still be doing ok, up and down
[19:25:55] <Velveeta> go up to $100+, and all of a sudden, every single hand is a loser
[19:26:46] <carpii> hehe yea
[19:27:05] <carpii> i was doing ok on roulette, then put down $500 on a single number
[19:27:24] <carpii> the croupier did some odd stuff where he waited a long time after spinnign wheel
[19:27:27] <carpii> then let go of ball
[19:27:32] <carpii> which he hadnt done on any other hand
[19:27:44] <Velveeta> yowza
[19:27:45] <carpii> obv i didnt win, but was pissed off because he obviously made sure of it
[19:27:51] <Velveeta> right
[19:28:13] <carpii> not sure how accurate they can be, but i heard an experienced spinner can get it into a chosen quarter at least
[19:28:20] <Velveeta> with a good croupier, if he releases the ball at a consistent spot on each spin, with a consistent method of flicking, you can at least narrow down a range of where the ball is likely to land
[19:28:30] <Velveeta> when they completely deviate from that, you have a problem :D
[19:28:33] <carpii> yea
[19:28:46] <carpii> it was my mistake though, i should have placed my big bet after he released the ball
[19:28:49] <carpii> ill know for next time
[19:28:57] <carpii> you get a short period of time where you can still bet
[19:28:59] <Velveeta> good call
[19:29:01] <Velveeta> right
[19:29:28] <Velveeta> also, if you *do* have a croupier with a consistent pattern on how he releases the ball‚Ä¶ tipping them well (i've heard) can help ensure the continuation of that
[19:29:45] <carpii> ah i tend to tip quite well anyway
[19:29:45] <MACscr> Does my line 4 look wrong here? http://pastie.org/pastes/8345420/text. Just trying to do a simple replace on an a particular spans contents within a panel-group when its done animating
[19:29:49] <Velveeta> i would imagine especially if you drop comments like "keep doing what you're doing!"
[19:30:07] <carpii> ive not noticed much difference in winning tbh, but if they are chatty ill tip them
[19:30:21] <Velveeta> macscr: i don't see anything obvious with that that looks like it would be wrong
[19:30:27] <carpii> i hate the grumpy dealers who make you feel like they have better things to do than serve you
[19:30:33] <Velveeta> carpii: oh god so do i
[19:30:42] <Velveeta> it's so much better when they're chatty and funny
[19:30:45] <carpii> yea :)
[19:30:54] <Velveeta> if you're gonna take all my money, which you're probably gonna do, at least give me a good time while you do it
[19:31:23] <carpii> hehe ea
[19:31:33] <Velveeta> i will say that the el cortez that i mentioned earlier, the seedier side of vegas, their dealers are most definitely not of the "chipper" variety :D
[19:31:42] <Velveeta> they mostly just act like they're just punching a clock
[19:31:46] <carpii> we ended up at hooters casino one night, and had the funniest girl dealer ever
[19:31:57] <Velveeta> oh thanks for mentioning that
[19:32:01] <vladikoff> MACscr, what is `shown`
[19:32:07] <carpii> she was pointing out girls who were walking around just looking for escort business and stuff
[19:32:10] <Velveeta> because, being a man, i'm curious how that casino is :D
[19:32:27] <carpii> its kinda fun if you get a talkative dealer
[19:32:29] <Velveeta> vladikoff: he's using a collapse bootstrap plugin, which emits that event when it's done animating the expansion
[19:32:37] <Velveeta> carpii: i mean strictly based on eye-candy
[19:32:44] <carpii> but we went back the next night, and theres quite a lot of dumb girls who just deal and arent interested in banter
[19:32:53] <Velveeta> well that sucks
[19:33:03] <carpii> id say 1 in 5 are real eye candy
[19:33:11] <carpii> the rest are at the tail-end of their career, so to speak :)
[19:33:20] <Velveeta> so, las vegas club has a lot of girls behind the tables dancing on poles (just dancing, not "pole-dancing"), and the girls at the tables seem to be quite chatty
[19:33:29] <Velveeta> so it's kind of the best of both worlds, eye candy plus banter
[19:33:32] <carpii> cool
[19:33:43] <carpii> i remember a downtown one where they were dancing on tables and stuff
[19:33:46] <carpii> cant remember which
[19:33:50] <carpii> but they were all beautiful
[19:33:51] <Velveeta> we also have a good time at tropicana, south end of the strip
[19:33:57] <Velveeta> the dealers there were very cheery
[19:34:02] <carpii> oh yea, we visited tropicana before hoooters
[19:34:06] <carpii> i think its just over the road
[19:34:19] <Velveeta> the games were up and down, as opposed to just outright eating your cash, so it was a good balance between losses and dealer banter
[19:34:20] <carpii> might be wrong, admittedly i was quite drunk by then :p
[19:34:29] <Velveeta> yeah tropicana is right down the road from hooters
[19:34:33] <carpii> ah yea :)
[19:38:17] <carpii> welp, thanks for the vegas chat, was fun
[19:38:24] <carpii> i think i should try to do some work :(
[19:38:45] <carpii> or maybe have another beer while i decide what to work on
[19:44:57] <Velveeta> it was rather fun :)
[19:45:41] <Velveeta> and yeah, i have some unit tests to finalize before monday, when i tell my PM that "oh hey, since barely anybody's pulled down our latest package anyway, let's make this release twice as large and twice as long, instead of hitting our deadline of last monday, which we already missed!"
[19:56:44] <boytoy> Velveeta: what stuff are you working on?
[19:57:35] <Velveeta> boytoy: i maintain our internal UI widget library
[19:58:15] <Velveeta> so currently, i'm finishing up the revamping of 100 or so unit tests of said library, and then expanding our "selectr" widget to accept local client-side data sets as opposed to just strictly select/option nodes
[19:58:36] <Velveeta> and then i'm sure my PM will have a slew more improvements for me based on some meetings with our product teams over the last couple weeks
[19:58:58] <boytoy> cool
[19:59:02] <Velveeta> and we have one of our front end engineer leads coming in from our DC office this week‚Ä¶ and you know what that means‚Ä¶ company-sanctioned happy hour‚Ä¶ so i have to prepare
[19:59:17] <boytoy> so basically people in your company design apps and stuff, and they're all based on your library?
[19:59:37] <boytoy> like you're the man in charge of the building blocks?
[20:00:03] <Velveeta> so they develop apps, yes, and yes, i'm in charge of the building blocks‚Ä¶ their *designers* tend to deviate off the beaten path of our building blocks, which is something we're still trying to remedy :)
[20:00:10] <boytoy> hehe i love company happy hours.. as long as we don't return to the office after that :)
[20:00:17] <boytoy> every time you say PM i think prime minister.. it's confusing
[20:00:27] <Velveeta> which is what my recent jquery conference presentation was based on, breaking modules down into itty bitty components and stacking them from there
[20:00:43] <boytoy> nice
[20:00:45] <Velveeta> heheh in my case, PM = product manager, they determine our priorities for our upcoming releases
[20:01:04] <Velveeta> and in my case, being our platform team, our priorities are based on the priorities of the individual product teams that consume our product
[20:01:05] <boytoy> ah like that =)
[20:02:17] <boytoy> sounds like a big deal
[20:02:26] <boytoy> not everybody's got their own custom-made jquery ui / jquery mobile
[20:02:50] <Velveeta> yeah we're not jquery-mobile-ready yet, but i do have some ideas on how to make our widgets mobile-friendly
[20:03:02] <Velveeta> i shared some of them with the lead dev on the jquery mobile project at the austin convention
[20:03:18] <Velveeta> a lot of our widgets are based (internally) on handlebars templates to render their content
[20:03:53] <Velveeta> and i think we could make them multi-device-friendly by having the equivalent of media-queries in javascript, and setting js breakpoints for multiple templates to swap out
[20:04:13] <Velveeta> if you think about something like a table/datagrid, with a laptop/desktop interface, you could put 20-30 columns in that thing no problem
[20:04:44] <Velveeta> but when you shrink the interface to a table or a smartphone, it's not enough to just figure out how to reorganize the data you're displaying, you need to entirely reevaluate what data you're displaying
[20:04:57] <boytoy> i think i have a vague idea of what you mean
[20:05:03] <Velveeta> if you have 30 columns worth of data in full display mode, chances are not all 30 columns are absolutely relevant
[20:05:29] <Velveeta> at smaller interface sizes, you need to prioritize what's *actually* important for the display, maybe just a name and some contact info, and a link to display more info
[20:05:36] <boytoy> im just a layman though
[20:05:49] <Velveeta> and rather than just vertically tiling column data, that would be a nightmare on smartphones
[20:05:53] <boytoy> so basically it's kinda like a smart packery? where each item is displayed according to its importance?
[20:06:06] <Velveeta> imagine if you had to vertically scroll through 30 vertical tiles that represent 1 30-column record
[20:06:10] <boytoy> my latest packery fiddle btw -- http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/CRCtz/9/
[20:07:00] <Velveeta> well in this demo, you're displaying everything regardless of size‚Ä¶ the *size* of the items looks to be adjusted based on fitvids and some css rules, but the amount of content isn't changed based on size
[20:07:09] <Velveeta> what i'm saying is, imagine you're looking at a table of physician info
[20:07:40] <Velveeta> you have a column for the name, maybe some contact info, address, email, etc, and then 20-30 columns of various columns of data measures, average length of stay, average hospital charges, etc
[20:07:51] <Velveeta> on a smaller interface, not all of that is even necessary
[20:08:00] <Velveeta> you might only *really* need the physician name and address
[20:08:05] <boytoy> if you resize the window it'll rearrange stuff though which is kinda cool.. i figured yours were similar except it knew what stuff was most important
[20:08:18] <Velveeta> and really, that could be combined into 1 tile that you could scroll down vertically
[20:08:38] <boytoy> cool
[20:08:39] <Velveeta> yeah, i see that your stuff reorganizes itself vertically
[20:08:52] <Velveeta> but imagine if you have 30 columns of data, on a smart phone, per record
[20:09:06] <Velveeta> can you imagine having to scroll down 30 tiles worth of data just to bypass record #1 on a phone?
[20:09:25] <boytoy> ouch
[20:09:32] <boytoy> yeah i can see why that'd be tricky =)
[20:09:33] <Velveeta> all that extra stuff is for the most part unimportant, it's extra data that's nice to have on larger interfaces, but on smaller, not the heart of the data you're interested in
[20:09:58] <MACscr> What do you guys think is the best way to have a button that will copy a url to the users clipboard
[20:10:08] <Velveeta> so i'm proposing having multiple layout templates, so that on a desktop, you get all 30 columns, on a tablet, you get maybe 5-6 of the most important ones, on a smartphone, you get just the basic data
[20:10:27] <Velveeta> macscr: i think to copy stuff to the clipboard, you have to use embedded flash plugins
[20:10:43] <MACscr> or do think its just better to highlight it and have it ready to be copied
[20:10:51] <Velveeta> boytoy: and at various media-query breakpoints, e.g. < 700px wide, you swap out the template entirely
[20:11:04] <Velveeta> so you shrink the columns as you can to a certain point, and then you relayout the entire interface
[20:11:18] <boytoy> Velveeta: that might actually be very useful
[20:11:28] <boytoy> could probably sell it to a ton of hospitals worldwide too
[20:11:32] <Velveeta> and then you shrink that interface as you can to a certain point, and at (e.g. smartphone) a new size, you entirely swap out the layout again for something even less informative
[20:11:41] <boytoy> that is, assuming you run off with the idea yourself and dont show it to your PM =)
[20:11:51] <Velveeta> boytoy: i work for a healthcare consultant firm, so that's why i went the healthcare route ;)
[20:12:04] <boytoy> oh i see i see
[20:12:22] <boytoy> big fan of healthcare myself
[20:12:40] <Velveeta> but i proposed the same thing to alex schmitz, who's the lead dev on jquery mobile
[20:12:57] <Velveeta> that for their widgets, they consider multiple layouts based on media queries
[20:13:01] <tw2113> Velveeta, are we screwed with Obamacare? </offtopic>
[20:13:08] <Velveeta> versus just figuring out how to shrink existing interfaces
[20:13:27] <Velveeta> tw2113: that depends on whether you're a republican, democrat, or unaffiliated
[20:13:46] <tw2113> I voted for Gary Johnson
[20:14:00] <Velveeta> he was libertarian right?
[20:14:03] <tw2113> ya
[20:14:07] <Velveeta> then you're screwed
[20:14:47] <boytoy> Velveeta: would love to see how that turns out though
[20:15:14] <Velveeta> boytoy: yeah, so at some point soon, i'm gonna start working as a contributor for jquery-ui
[20:15:25] <Velveeta> once i can figure out how to jive it with my work schedule
[20:15:41] <Velveeta> and the ui and mobile projects are merging, so you have to write code that's viable in both
[20:16:03] <Velveeta> but at that point, i'll probably *re*assert that stance about essentially javascript media-query breaks for templates
[20:16:08] <Velveeta> and we'll see if it takes
[20:17:08] <boytoy> oh they are merging? thats great news
[20:17:26] <boytoy> best of luck with that
[20:18:02] <boytoy> god knows, being a dev is like a super power, every single one of us should have the ability to make millions within months if we so pleased
[20:18:04] <Velveeta> yep yep, so, ideally, mobile should extend jquery ui
[20:18:18] <Velveeta> but i think the goal is to make widgets work properly in any environment, including mobile
[20:18:41] <boytoy> yes indeed
[20:18:52] <Velveeta> and mobile might add some mobile-specific optimizations, i'm not sure, but as far as adaptive design and whatnot, it should work seamlessly in both
[20:19:19] <Velveeta> boytoy: "god knows, being a dev is like a super power, every single one of us should have the ability to make millions within months if we so pleased" -- don't i know it
[20:19:38] <Velveeta> i know that i could make a shit-ton of money if i could have a shit-ton-of-money-level idea‚Ä¶ my problem is the ideas :D
[20:19:43] <Velveeta> implementation is no problem :D
[20:19:53] <boytoy> hehe =)
[20:40:40] <MACscr> how do i get the cursor to highlight text in an input field for easy copy and paste? I know i cant without flash get it to actually copy it, but id like to make it as simple as possible on the user to at least have it already highlighted
[20:41:14] <Velveeta> $(input).trigger('focus')
[20:52:57] <MACscr> rofl, just spent 10 minute trying to find out why my div wasnt hiding by default and its because i was using display:hidden;. Even with inspector, it wasnt obvious to me. I think ive been coding to long today. =P
[20:53:20] <Velveeta> heheheheh
[21:16:13] <Velveeta> 2 glass mugs of whiskey down! though the 2nd was crown, which kind of doesn't count
[21:24:31] <Velveeta> holy shit miley cyrus has pasties under her mesh dress
[21:24:44] <Velveeta> she's a total whore and i find it entertaining
[21:24:56] <synapt> that seemed kinda random for this channel
[21:25:27] <Velveeta> that's true, but earlier, we discussed millet cyrus, so it was semi-apropos
[21:25:37] <Velveeta> miley, stupid colloquy
[21:25:47] <T13|sleeps> :0
[21:26:19] <T13|sleeps> She has pasties huh? lol
[21:26:57] <Velveeta> yassir, but it's vegas, so it's ok
[21:28:16] <Velveeta> also she has little people dancing for her
[21:28:39] <Velveeta> it's like a cosmological collision of memes to up her ratings
[21:30:14] <MACscr> if do something like so: http://pastie.org/pastes/8345576/text, will it wait to post the form before it opens the new link?
[21:30:20] <MACscr> if not, how can i make sure it does?
[21:30:37] <Velveeta> have you tested it yet?
[21:30:56] <MACscr> yes, doesnt look like it is, but i need to do some more testing
[21:32:11] <Velveeta> so, you have a preventDefault in that click handler, which posts your form
[21:32:44] <Velveeta> so it will absolutely post your form and then execute the manual invocation if your window.location = href statement
[21:55:56] <Velveeta> I still find it hard to believe that a) my first reaction to 30 Seconds to Mars is "hey, that lead singer looks a lot like Jared Leto with long hair" and b) the lead singer of 30 Seconds to Mars is Jared Leto with long hair  ..............c) his singing is not bad for a movie-star-turned-singer
[22:29:00] <LoneSoldier728> hey I am using require.js with jquery and for some reason I am having trouble anyone understand this
[22:29:03] <LoneSoldier728> here is the SO post
[22:29:10] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18940501/jquery-is-not-loading-when-using-require-js
[22:30:52] <fgh> LoneSoldier728, http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html seems relevant
[22:32:56] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[22:33:03] <LoneSoldier728> i did what it mentions in the documentation
[22:33:06] <LoneSoldier728> and still having problems
[22:34:06] <LoneSoldier728> look at my SO post
[22:40:03] <Velveeta> so, jquery has a beautifully partitioned AMD version of itself coming out soon
[22:40:17] <abjorn> jquerying myself into stardom
[22:40:20] <abjorn> aw ya
[22:40:30] <fgh> LoneSoldier728, your cdn url, seems to be missing the '.js' ext
[22:40:34] <Velveeta> in the meantime, i don't personally load my projects with it, i just load it separately and then require in my custom modules
[22:40:58] <Velveeta> but if fgh is right, then that's a perfect solution
[22:41:21] <fgh> not sure, might be related
[22:41:36] <fgh> a better channel might be #requirejs
[22:41:50] <Velveeta> (y)
[22:42:12] <Velveeta> #jquery == #javascriptingeneral
[22:42:46] <LoneSoldier728> ? it has the .js ext
[22:43:21] <Velveeta> lonesoldier728: is there a demo for us to see?
[22:43:33] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18940501/jquery-is-not-loading-when-using-require-js
[22:43:40] <LoneSoldier728> that is the code
[22:43:50] <LoneSoldier728> is that good Velveeta?
[22:45:01] <Velveeta> it's a good start, an actual jsfiddle demo would be better though, so we could actually play with the code and save updated veraions
[22:45:07] <LoneSoldier728> kk
[22:46:57] <LoneSoldier728> not sure how to make it with multiple js files?
[22:47:43] <Velveeta> i'm not exactly sure either :D
[22:48:03] <LoneSoldier728> heh, ya but this is driving me crazy
[22:48:11] <LoneSoldier728> as I am trying to learn require.js and right from the start
[22:48:14] <LoneSoldier728> I am having issues
[22:48:42] <Velveeta> so my own personal experience w/ require has all been server side
[22:48:54] <Velveeta> we precompile our js bundles for deployment
[22:55:49] <LoneSoldier728> how do u work with jquery then client side
[22:56:01] <LoneSoldier728> I am trying to use backbone but keep models and views separated
[22:56:39] <Velveeta> so we (from release to release) modify our backbone models/views/collections a lot more often than our libs
[22:56:59] <Velveeta> so we use a grunt file to concat our base libs of jquery, backbone, etc and uglify them
[22:57:17] <Velveeta> and then our modules get concat'd and uglified in a separate bundle
[22:57:43] <LoneSoldier728> hm
[22:58:03] <Velveeta> that way our modules, which are a lot more susceptible to change, get their cache busted more frequently
[22:58:03] <LoneSoldier728> but from my understanding if I was not to concat or have the file joined into 1
[22:58:07] <Velveeta> but our libs don't
[22:58:20] <LoneSoldier728> is there a way to keep models and views separated
[22:58:34] <LoneSoldier728> and "require" them in different files so they can be calle
[22:58:35] <LoneSoldier728> d
[22:58:38] <Velveeta> defined "separated" like, into separate physical files?
[22:58:45] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[22:58:49] <LoneSoldier728> like a views folder
[22:58:53] <LoneSoldier728> and a models folder
[22:58:54] <LoneSoldier728> etc.
[22:58:58] <Velveeta> sure, we do that ourselves
[22:59:16] <LoneSoldier728> but then how do u call them in other files
[22:59:17] <LoneSoldier728> ?
[22:59:29] <LoneSoldier728> like if the views file is using the model file
[22:59:37] <LoneSoldier728> how do u call the model file in the view file
[23:00:03] <Velveeta> we do something like this: define(['models/ourModel', 'collections'ourCollection'], function (ourModel, our Collection) {} );
[23:00:21] <Velveeta> use define to require in your model file from the view
[23:00:46] <LoneSoldier728> I can just call define or is define based off a tool?
[23:01:01] <LoneSoldier728> I was under the assumption that define was based on a tool
[23:01:10] <Velveeta> define is part of require
[23:01:15] <Velveeta> or rather, require implements define
[23:01:29] <Velveeta> you can get 'define' support from other amd libraries also
[23:01:47] <Velveeta> like we use almond in production, for file size
[23:02:09] <Velveeta> it provides the define function and the ability to crawl dependencies, which is all we need
[23:02:24] <Velveeta> and is something like 15k
[23:02:48] <LoneSoldier728> so
[23:02:55] <LoneSoldier728> i should be able to just use almond instead then
[23:03:23] <Velveeta> almond, for the *most* part, should be a drop in replacement for require, yes, with a smaller footprint
[23:04:25] <LoneSoldier728> hm but no clue why jquery is not loaded?
[23:04:36] <LoneSoldier728> do i need a map file or something along with just the min
[23:04:55] <Velveeta> you shouldn't
[23:05:08] <Velveeta> is there any error being thrown in the terminal or console?
[23:05:20] <LoneSoldier728> ya the console
[23:05:22] <LoneSoldier728> is getting this
[23:05:34] <LoneSoldier728> Get file error
[23:05:43] <LoneSoldier728> and then an uncaught Error: Script error for: jquery
[23:05:58] <Velveeta> than sounds like a bad address or something
[23:06:00] <LoneSoldier728> with this link actually
[23:06:00] <LoneSoldier728> http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#scripterror
[23:06:52] <LoneSoldier728> ya so it is error number 7
[23:07:03] <LoneSoldier728> that is linked to it... but i dont get why it is a bad address
[23:07:07] <LoneSoldier728> if i am using google's cdn
[23:07:16] <LoneSoldier728> and have it locally stored with the exact name
[23:08:11] <Velveeta> well one thing i see is that you're referencing //ajax.etc in that url, instead of http://ajax.url
[23:08:22] <Velveeta> could that make a difference?
[23:08:43] <LoneSoldier728> let me check
[23:09:55] <LoneSoldier728> hm
[23:09:56] <LoneSoldier728> nope
[23:10:23] <Velveeta> can i see some updated code?
[23:10:29] <LoneSoldier728> hm
[23:10:31] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[23:10:40] <Velveeta> even if you just paste the paths object here
[23:10:46] <LoneSoldier728> https://gist.github.com/lgavra/6657155
[23:11:08] <LoneSoldier728> underscore and backbone are not loading either now... but it loaded from the cache before somehow
[23:11:52] <LoneSoldier728> i tried the .js extension on underscore to see if that helped
[23:20:09] <LoneSoldier728> anything?
[23:26:39] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/50PATrdj
[23:26:42] <LoneSoldier728> getting that error
[23:39:58] <LoneSoldier728> well figured it out velveeta thanks tho
[23:59:05] <doug65536> Velveeta: you were right about the protocol - locally, it will assume file:// protocol. the other problem was his base url was not right and the paths to handlebars/etc needed to be relative to that, and the baseUrl is picked up automatically from the path to the main module
