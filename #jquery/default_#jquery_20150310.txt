[00:24:07] <wemini> i know about media queries, but i want not just a different css file, a different layout html/php file altogether for different devices / orientations. what is the technique for doing this?
[00:26:26] <nardev> hello, i get a json array from ajax request, and i need to set chartjs data, however, it seems that data is not encoded properly http://paste.debian.net/160492/   for example, i try to set --->   labels: [period_labelsX],   but it fails, although if hardcode an array there "val1", "val2", "val3"... it works ok...
[00:33:28] <nardev> how to convert string, received from ajax JSON  to an array for data in chartjs???
[00:33:54] <nardev> http://paste.debian.net/160492/   for example, i try to set --->   labels: [period_labelsX]
[01:07:44] <charpandnl> hi :0
[01:08:25] <charpandnl> does someone here has some advanced experience with jquery datatables.net together with the ColVis extension?
[01:08:59] <duch_kazatel> just ask your questions.
[01:09:05] <duch_kazatel> if somebody can help, they will.
[01:09:54] <charpandnl> ColVis normally puts a button on top of the grid after rendering. Instead I want it to attach as a additional span to the th elements.
[02:15:31] <anli> Is there a way to clear timeouts and intervals with script?
[02:15:35] <anli> I dont have those ids
[02:17:08] <anli> Seems like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3141064/how-to-stop-all-timeouts-and-intervals-using-javascript answers my question
[02:57:45] <HeyBro> Hello
[02:59:33] <HeyBro> I have a problem. I would like to download a file from an ajax request, but i have just seen it's not possible. Anyway, i have to make a plugin chrome which will call an ajax request in order to get a file to download
[03:01:04] <Cork> HeyBro: you can download a file through ajax
[03:01:12] <Cork> well at least in newer browsers
[03:01:29] <HeyBro> I didn't find how :/
[03:01:47] <Cork> you set the response type to blob
[03:02:05] <Cork> then you have to use the blob as a target for a link and then the user clicks the link to store it locally
[03:02:46] <Cork> ?mdn xmlhttprequest binary data
[03:02:47] <b-ot> Cork: XMLHttpRequest - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest
[03:02:50] <Cork> hmm
[03:02:56] <Cork> no
[03:03:04] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Sending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data
[03:04:02] <Cork> and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL
[03:05:11] <HeyBro> ok ok i will give a try. If i get it, i can't do this with Jquery ?
[03:05:16] <HeyBro> only with XHTML
[03:05:16] <Cork> that said, providing a normal link that can be used to download the source is normally better
[03:05:23] <HeyBro> XMLHttp*
[03:05:32] <Cork> ajax is xmlhttprequest
[03:05:51] <Cork> i have to check if you can actually get the responseType through it though
[03:06:04] <Cork> never needed it
[03:06:08] <Cork> (in jquery)
[03:06:24] <HeyBro> ok
[03:06:27] <HeyBro> thank you
[03:06:47] <HeyBro> i will give a try with this, even i would prefer use jquery but it doesn't change anything
[03:07:36] <HeyBro> You talk about blob but if my file can be a .docx, or a an Excel, or a pdf , etc… ?
[03:09:20] <HeyBro> But
[03:09:27] <HeyBro> it only works with MDN ?
[03:09:49] <HeyBro> can i use this in a plugin chrome ?
[03:10:43] <Cork> HeyBro: this is a web standard
[03:10:48] <Cork> mdn is just a good documentation
[03:11:08] <Cork> blob is a data access form similar to bytearray except it doesn't have to be in memory
[03:11:16] <HeyBro> Ok ok
[03:11:28] <Cork> looking around it looks like ajax doesn't support it
[03:11:39] <Cork> there seams to be a heated debate about it and a plugin though
[03:11:46] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1525
[03:11:51] <Cork> https://github.com/acigna/jquery-ajax-native
[03:12:24] <Cork> also
[03:12:24] <Cork> <HeyBro> it only works with MDN ?
[03:12:28] <Cork> opps
[03:12:31] <Cork> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11461
[03:15:23] <HeyBro> so the last code you give me should works perhaps
[03:33:22] <HeyBro> I don't get how to save my file with jquery
[03:33:30] <HeyBro> or even with javascript
[03:36:44] <Cork> HeyBro: the second link i gave you3
[03:39:29] <HeyBro> Oh
[03:39:42] <HeyBro> I create an url
[03:40:04] <HeyBro> ok then what should i do ? with this link i mean, how can i save the file ?
[03:40:29] <HeyBro> Sorry i am newbie ˆˆ
[03:41:32] <HeyBro> cause i get something like this : blob:http%3A//localhost%3A4242/25c92c38-edea-479a-b953-3833e9dd42c6
[03:45:41] <Cork> HeyBro: you have to present the link for the user so they can click it
[03:46:22] <Cork> HeyBro: though that said, note this is the rules for the web, chrome extensions might have other options to save files
[03:46:41] <Cork> (and this isn't the right channel that that question)
[03:53:47] <HeyBro> Is there anyway to guess the extension when i get the response with Blob ?
[03:54:04] <HeyBro> in order to set the right type
[03:54:21] <HeyBro> it can be a .docx, a .xls, etc...
[03:54:43] <Cork> HeyBro: the blob should contain the content type
[03:55:23] <HeyBro> I mean when i create it
[03:55:33] <Cork> uh, xhr creates it
[03:55:44] <Cork> it should include the content type the server sent
[03:55:58] <HeyBro> Ok but
[03:56:00] <HeyBro> for example
[03:56:05] <HeyBro> i have to do like this :
[03:56:22] <HeyBro> var blob = new Blob([oReq.response], {type: "??"});
[03:56:28] <Cork> no
[03:56:33] <HeyBro> No ?
[03:56:43] <Cork> oReq.respons is a blob already
[03:56:50] <Cork> *response
[03:57:15] <HeyBro> this is my code :var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
[03:57:15] <HeyBro> oReq.open("GET", "http://192.168.91.26:82/TH_Webservice/web/app_dev.php/document", true);
[03:57:15] <HeyBro> oReq.responseType = "arraybuffer";
[03:57:15] <HeyBro> oReq.onload = function(oEvent) {
[03:57:16] <HeyBro>     var blob = new Blob([oReq.response], {type: "application/octet-binary"});
[03:57:16] <HeyBro>     var objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
[03:57:17] <HeyBro>     console.log(objectURL);
[03:57:17] <HeyBro> };
[03:57:28] <Cork> don't paste multi lines in the channel
[03:57:32] <HeyBro> Sorry
[03:57:39] <Cork> also you use arraybuffer not blob
[03:57:49] <Cork> arraybuffer doesn't keep content type so you lose that there
[03:57:57] <Cork> use a blob instead
[03:59:45] <HeyBro> Oooo shit ok
[03:59:48] <HeyBro> I get it
[04:00:07] <HeyBro> One last thing, when i do like this i didnt get the same name
[04:00:48] <Cork> ya, you don't have a name so you have to set that on the link
[04:01:08] <Cork> set download on the a tag to the name you want it to have
[04:05:41] <HeyBro> You mean when i create the a element ?
[04:07:01] <Cork> HeyBro: yes
[04:08:26] <compact> hey. i have this plugin: https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js
[04:08:36] <compact> window.myPie = new Chart(ctx).Pie(pieData,options);
[04:08:50] <compact> pieData is the options. how can i get the options from url though? I've got it son encode etc
[04:08:51] <compact> json*
[04:09:20] <Cork> compact: just make an ajax call and pull in the data
[04:14:52] <compact> trying get
[04:14:54] <compact> pieData = $.get("/reporting/index/pie/");
[04:14:56] <compact> jquery
[04:15:05] <Cork> the data isn't a return value
[04:15:16] <Cork> you have a callback with the data
[04:15:25] <Cork> and no you can't access the data outside the callback
[04:55:28] <BrazenBraden> hey guys
[04:56:25] <BrazenBraden> I was wondering.. can you pass an object that has a punch of prototype functions in it to anotehr function which will then call one of the functions from inside that object? I will prepare a gist now
[04:59:54] <BrazenBraden> https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/d46ae1fbbad4ef37ce46
[05:01:55] <Cork> BrazenBraden: sure you can
[05:02:59] <BrazenBraden> Cork, assumed that much but the external function, when calling the object function, the object references the Window instead of the Contact object. Thought I would have to pass my reference or pointer or something.. i dunno
[05:03:25] <Cork> BrazenBraden: you have to call the function on the object
[05:03:34] <Cork> you can't pass the function without the object reference
[05:03:58] <Cork> meaning func(contact.doSomething) will disconnect doSomething from contact
[05:04:14] <BrazenBraden> oh really?
[05:04:19] <Omar-> hello everyone
[05:04:21] <BrazenBraden> so how do I keep it connected?
[05:04:38] <Cork> for example func(contact, 'doSomething')
[05:04:56] <Cork> and in newer browsers you can do func(contact.doSomething.bind(contact))
[05:05:13] <Cork> but if you need to support anything except really new ie you can't use .bind
[05:05:29] <Cork> you can also use an anonymous function to wrap it
[05:05:29] <BrazenBraden> Cork, interesting.. which is the preferred method?
[05:05:32] <BrazenBraden> right, so old method
[05:05:40] <sacho_> use a shim
[05:05:44] <Cork> if you don't need the support use .bind
[05:05:54] <Cork> no careful with extending native functions
[05:06:03] <BrazenBraden> ok.. let me give that try then :)
[05:06:11] <Cork> ?mdn function.bind
[05:06:11] <b-ot> Cork: Function.prototype.bind() - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[05:06:46] <BrazenBraden> Cork, brilliant!
[05:06:52] <BrazenBraden> you are amazeballs
[05:07:24] <BrazenBraden> Cork, so, this .bind(), is it the same as doing a .on() ?
[05:07:45] <Cork> check the support no
[05:07:57] <Cork> bind on a function has nothing to with jquery bind
[05:08:08] <BrazenBraden> ah right. so easy to get confused :S
[05:08:27] <Cork> BrazenBraden: like i was about to say, check the support section in mdn
[05:08:35] <Cork> so the browser versions you need is supported
[05:08:53] <BrazenBraden> well, latest chrome of firefox will be used
[05:08:58] <BrazenBraden> Maybe safari
[05:09:21] <Cork> safari might be a risk
[05:09:25] <Cork> depending on how up to date it is
[05:09:30] <Cork> 5.1+
[05:09:51] <BrazenBraden> Cork, regardless, we can dictate which browser we recommend to use this software with
[05:09:56] <DeoSama> Anyone think thety could help me figure out why my setTimeout() isn't waiting?
[05:09:57] <DeoSama> http://pastebin.com/R6CRFrhM
[05:11:10] <Cork> i highly doubt it doesn't
[05:11:33] <DeoSama> Cork, me?
[05:11:35] <Uhkis> well that paste was unreadable
[05:11:37] <Cork> yes
[05:11:46] <Cork> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/7y8gbqde/
[05:11:56] <Cork> i always copy messy js to fiddle
[05:11:59] <Cork> makes things much easier to read
[05:12:04] <Uhkis> :-)
[05:12:23] <Cork> there is a reason i push so hard for ppl to use jsfiddle :)
[05:13:03] <Cork> DeoSama: anyway start by looking through if the parser throws or something
[05:13:12] <Cork> or that the code executes at all
[05:13:20] <Cork> cause the timer looks fine
[05:17:20] <DeoSama> Cork, the code executes; however, it's not in the order I need it to. :(
[05:17:37] <Cork> DeoSama: you need it to wait for the network call?
[05:17:45] <DeoSama> Yeah
[05:17:46] <DeoSama> :(
[05:17:50] <Cork> then call it from the callback
[05:17:54] <Cork> a timer isn't a solution
[05:18:06] <Cork> it will always be racy
[05:18:14] <DeoSama> like, in the .done()?
[05:18:17] <Cork> yes
[05:18:20] <DeoSama> omfg
[05:18:24] <DeoSama> why didn't i think of that?
[05:18:33] <Cork> XD
[05:18:46] <atul> Hi Atul here.
[05:18:55] <Cork> man i love that response
[05:19:18] <atul> I want to get started for GSoC. Can you guys please help a li'l bit?
[05:19:37] <DeoSama> haha
[05:19:40] <Cork> atul: look at the references in the gsoc page
[05:19:53] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List
[05:19:54] <Uhkis> it's not summer yet!
[05:56:14] <dismist> do i need special configuration options in the .ajaxSetup for a plugin i'm using to be able to fetch pages using a relative path name
[05:56:30] <Cork> no
[05:56:47] <Cork> relative is always relative to the url the page loaded from though
[05:56:56] <Cork> not to where the script is located
[05:57:10] <Cork> (and is why you normally want to use absolute paths not relative)
[05:58:20] <dismist> man i dont know what the deal is... im pointing it to /cache/filename.txt to load... when echoing out the url in php i am able to copy it and paste into my browser and see my json... but datatables initializes and everthing just fine with no errors, claiming it cannot find that filename
[05:58:34] <dismist> absolute path did not work either but when i would paste in my browser i saw it
[05:58:50] <dismist> could it be some sort of crazy htaccess http->https for all requests on server issue
[05:58:52] <Cork> dismist: rename the file to .json
[05:59:01] <dismist> u think its  a header issue?
[05:59:07] <dismist> good thought
[05:59:10] <Cork> as .txt most likely will get the wrong content type header by the server
[05:59:30] <dismist> ill bark up that tree for a bit and let you know my findings
[05:59:37] <Cork> :)
[06:04:46] <dismist> im not going to be able to modify the extensions just kind of due to some restrictions with old coding in our framework, however are you sure jquery sees text/plain and text/json any differently?  is there a way to tell jquery that the page the plugin is fetching is https? the plugin has no switches as far as i can tell relating to https sites.  i wonder if i should try to get it onto another
[06:04:46] <dismist> server before jumping to conclusions that the problem is even there...http://prntscr.com/6f0ya5
[06:05:26] <Cork> dismist: json should have content-type: application/json
[06:05:30] <Cork> and yes the content type matter
[06:05:45] <Cork> dismist: you could override the content type with a .htaccess i guess
[06:05:47] <dismist> so is there a way to set it globally with .ajaxSetup ?
[06:06:05] <Cork> the content type is controlled by the server
[06:06:26] <dismist> ah.. my mistake.  i was thinking when you send data via post with the ajax command
[06:06:28] <Cork> you would have to add a custom parser that treat text/plain as json
[06:06:30] <dismist> you tell it text or json then ;)
[06:06:44] <Cork> you say what you want yes
[06:06:58] <Cork> but the server still is the one deciding
[06:07:09] <Cork> dataType controlls the "Accept" header the browser sends
[06:07:16] <dismist> so u really think the plugin's just not reading the file because its not being served as json?  even on datatables.net they tell you to use the txt extension
[06:07:26] <dismist> they dont really mention headers whatsoever
[06:07:29] <Cork> so if you have a path with multiple different data types it can choose the response type
[06:07:33] <dismist> and its a pretty big time plugin..
[06:07:46] <Cork> dismist: i think the plugin gets text and expects an array or object yes
[06:08:22] <dismist> i have it formatted
[06:08:35] <Cork> the content isn't sniffed for the type
[06:08:40] <Cork> the content-type header tells the client what it is
[06:08:46] <Cork> and currently you tell the client it is text
[06:08:47] <dismist> https://droppin.net/cache/testJE8AuD.txt
[06:09:27] <Cork> ah you don't tell it is anything
[06:09:32] <Cork> so the browser sniffs it
[06:09:42] <Cork> and will most likely take it as text/plain
[06:09:58] <dismist> yeah thats what i was thinking
[06:10:09] <dismist> text is text at that point since its not being encoded or anything would be my assumption
[06:10:12] <Cork> anyway the browser won't ever guess it is json
[06:10:15] <Cork> so you have to tell it
[06:10:19] <dismist> i think its something with port 443
[06:10:28] <Cork> huh?
[06:10:30] <dismist> and my htaccess forwarding to https improperly
[06:10:34] <Cork> port 443 has nothing to do with it
[06:10:42] <dismist> i have this funky rule in my htaccess for port 443 and im not really sure why
[06:10:50] <Cork> port 443 has nothing to do with it
[06:10:52] <dismist> im not real savvy server side
[06:11:13] <Cork> you need to add a custom content type rule
[06:11:21] <Cork> that says filename.txt is application/json
[06:11:32] <dismist> http://pastebin.com/M7kGzvz2
[06:11:39] <Cork> alternatively have .php read the text file and send it with the correct content-type
[06:11:44] <dismist> it was working before without the https forwarding i had on
[06:11:53] <dismist> but it was also a diff version of datatables
[06:12:03] <dismist> messed up and made 2 major changes simultaneously
[06:18:03] <dismist> hey Cork: does this screenshot tell u anything? http://prntscr.com/6f12uj
[06:18:39] <ice9> I created this example but it doesn't show the data table, just a plain html table https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7b4fd18983268b8bbc8e
[06:20:14] <Cork> dismist: except that the image doesn't load, no
[06:20:35] <Cork> ?g imagebin
[06:20:35] <b-ot> Cork: Imagebin - Somewhere to Store Random Things → http://imagebin.ca/
[06:20:44] <Cork> hmm wrong one
[06:20:54] <Cork> http://imagebin.org/
[06:21:10] <ice9> ok I figured out what's wrong!
[06:21:32] <dismist> ice: i am trying to pull in the data from the server (a .txt file containing a very large array)
[06:21:38] <dismist> its not actually json now that i think about it
[06:22:05] <dismist> but datatables tells you to use the argument: ajax: 'path_to_txt.txt', dataSrc:'',
[06:22:08] <Cork> dismist: like i said might be simpler to just have php handle the request
[06:22:11] <dismist> i dont understand why the dataSrc
[06:22:40] <dismist> cuz its kind of nice to keep the browser on the same page
[06:22:52] <dismist> and not messing up your back button
[06:23:00] <Cork> huh?
[06:23:06] <Cork> i meant make the ajax call to php
[06:23:20] <Cork> have php get the data from where ever it is and have php send the json back
[06:23:25] <Cork> with the correct content-type header
[06:23:38] <dismist> oh, because im using another plugin
[06:23:40] <dismist> called data tables
[06:23:46] <dismist> so it is making the call
[06:23:53] <Cork> ok?
[06:24:06] <Cork> what make php not a possible endpoint in that?
[06:24:07] <Omar-> Anyone knows what imgur.com is using to allow user to zoom in/out image/photo ONLY without affecting viewport or other elements?
[06:24:22] <dismist> i dont want to recode datatables man
[06:24:35] <Cork> not sure why you think you need to
[06:24:51] <Omar-> in your mobile phone, if you open any image, you will be able to zoom while viewport doesn't change
[06:25:03] <dismist> man i bet its something quirky with my server cert
[06:25:06] <Cork> Omar-: mobile has two viewports
[06:25:10] <dismist> and the http->https forced forwarding
[06:25:12] <Cork> a "real" one and a virtual one
[06:25:14] <Omar-> meta viewport user-scalabe=no
[06:25:25] <Omar-> Cork who can I achieve that?
[06:25:25] <dismist> god damn google for making everyone go https to compete in rankings
[06:25:44] <Omar-> dismist +1 god damn google for spying on us
[06:25:51] <Cork> dismist: sigh, forwarding to https isn't the source of the problem
[06:26:02] <Cork> like i've told you more times then i can count now
[06:26:13] <dismist> yeah man i caught this damn chrome icon in my tray the other day
[06:26:17] <dismist> when chrome wasnt even running
[06:26:29] <Cork> also just so you know http/2 is basically https only
[06:26:36] <dismist> and its got my google analytics and everythinhg else down there
[06:26:44] <dismist> was not aware
[06:26:49] <dismist> i just know i had this working before the https
[06:26:52] <Cork> so it isn't just google
[06:27:08] <dismist> come on man google is too powerful
[06:27:10] <dismist> you must admit
[06:27:40] <Cork> they are powerful, but they aren't actually powerful enough in this area
[06:27:49] <Cork> the push back for https everywhere is hard
[06:27:57] <Cork> and i find that to be utterly silly
[06:28:58] <dismist> i thought https has been under fire a lot lately
[06:29:04] <dismist> with heartbleed and those other big scares
[06:29:19] <Cork> well old ssl implementation sure
[06:29:23] <Cork> but not really https
[06:29:37] <Cork> and definitely not in anyway that http is better
[06:29:45] <dismist> thats why im still wondering if i didnt do it wrong
[06:29:48] <dismist> when i set it up...
[06:30:05] <Cork> well when i loaded the page the cert wasn't valid
[06:30:07] <dismist> most of my pages have the green badge though except for the ones i  need to clean up which link to http resources
[06:30:18] <dismist> no shit
[06:30:24] <Cork> so unless you've added an exception for the page you won't be able to do calls
[06:30:31] <dismist> i wonder if locally i made my pc override the cert error
[06:31:15] <dismist> i dont recall ever doing anythjing like that but i know im globally whitelisted for permission to all things through whm on my vps for whatever thats worth
[06:31:49] <Cork> dismist: you most likely is missing the intermediate cert

[06:48:29] <HeyBro> Hi again
[06:48:57] <HeyBro> Im currently using the Blob format
[06:49:11] <HeyBro> In order to get a file from an Ajax request
[06:49:26] <HeyBro> The fact i would like to get the format of the file
[06:52:19] <HeyBro> Here is an example : https://gist.github.com/Mirozh/c7e095c32136d0927f6d
[06:53:09] <Katharsis> hi
[06:53:25] <Katharsis> any tips how to set max_length for tinymce textarea field?
[06:53:42] <HeyBro> I don't get it cause early i was able to get the name and the right format, but now it only get the name (which i can change) but without the format. I have checked my PHP function and it works. SO the problem came from the ajax request. Is there any way to get the format file of the Blob ?
[06:53:57] <BinaryKitten> Katharsis - issue is is that once tinymce has been applied, it's not technically a textarea anymore
[06:54:37] <Lehl0r> hey there does anyone know i can get an svg text from a document with text "x" in it
[06:55:03] <BinaryKitten> Katharsis not technically a jQuery issue, but the tinymce have a maxlength in their api
[06:55:05] <BinaryKitten> http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/api4:setting.tinymce.ui.TextBox.maxLength
[06:55:22] <Lehl0r> so for instance i have <text dy=".32em" x="-9" y="0" style="text-anchor: end;">xyz</text>
[06:55:34] <Lehl0r> and i want to have that element using jquery
[06:55:46] <Katharsis> BinaryKitten: i know the attribute, but how to block the textarea if the limit is acquired?
[06:56:05] <BinaryKitten> that's definitely a tinyMCE issue and not really a jQuery one
[06:56:48] <Katharsis> oh, then show me a link for jquery based wysiwyg
[06:57:19] <Katharsis> i need simple, light and with maxlength inluded feature editor
[06:57:44] <BinaryKitten> sorry i don't have the time spare to do that for you
[07:01:03] <Es0teric> how do you insert an element after a specific element?
[07:01:44] <BinaryKitten> specificElement.after(newElem);
[07:02:08] <BinaryKitten> or newElem.insertAfter(specificElement);
[07:03:07] <Juslintek> Hi, how can I find img, not contained within some class container
[07:03:35] <mbrzuzy> $('.class img')
[07:03:40] <mbrzuzy> $('.class').find('img')
[07:03:45] <mbrzuzy> take your pick
[07:04:03] <mbrzuzy> @Juslintek
[07:04:05] <HeyBro> Anyone here know the Blob Format ?
[07:04:56] <Juslintek> mbrzuzy, well its not that simple, I want something like: $('.class').find('div:not(.box-txt) .img');
[07:05:00] <Juslintek> will it work like that?
[07:05:14] <Juslintek>  $('.class').find('div:not(.box-txt) img');
[07:05:21] <mbrzuzy> oh
[07:05:23] <Omar-> Juslintek it should work
[07:05:26] <mbrzuzy> I missed that, my mistake
[07:05:38] <mbrzuzy> but you would do that $('div:not()').find('img') or $('div:not() img')
[07:05:43] <Omar-> $('.class div:not(.box-txt)').find('img');
[07:06:02] <HeyBro> How can i get the content-type from a blob fil ?
[07:06:08] <HeyBro> Blob*
[07:06:27] <Juslintek> thanx, mbrzuzy and Omar-
[07:07:33] <Cork> :not on a parent selector is often hard to get to do what you want
[07:07:51] <Cork> as it will match all parents
[07:11:56] <Juslintek> mbrzuzy, Omar-, still this selector: owl11919.find('.owl-item div:not(.irasas-text)').find('img').css({ 'width':'100%' }); on http://idealine.lt/ picking up all images inside owlcarousel item.
[07:15:09] <mbrzuzy> Juslintek, try putting up a jsfiddle
[07:15:15] <mbrzuzy> it would be easier for everyone to help
[07:15:20] <mbrzuzy> unless your issue relates to what Cork suggested
[07:16:38] <hlvwrk> o_O
[07:35:53] <Omar-> what does .call() mean at the end of a function?
[07:36:08] <Omar-> e.g.e function foo () { bla bla }.call( this );
[07:36:12] <Omar-> e.g.
[07:45:37] <Cork> ?mdn function.call @ Omar-
[07:45:38] <b-ot> Omar-: Function.prototype.call() - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[07:47:22] <Omar-> thanks Cork, i was reading about it
[07:47:43] <Cork> it basically let you set the this variable inside the function
[07:47:55] <Cork> ?mdn function.apply
[07:47:55] <b-ot> Cork: Function.prototype.apply() - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[07:47:57] <Cork> is more interesting
[07:48:08] <Omar-> i'm trying to steal some code from here https://gist.github.com/Palestinian/5ab1872f8898efd251be
[07:48:10] <Omar-> haha
[07:48:20] <Omar-> its tooooooooooooo complicated
[07:48:35] <Omar-> imgur uses touchevents to scale images
[07:48:48] <Omar-> in mobile phones
[07:48:53] <Cork> lovely one letter function names...
[07:49:00] <Cork> has this been minified?
[07:49:07] <Omar-> yup, which makes it even harder
[07:49:11] <Cork> ya
[07:49:20] <Omar-> I dont know, maybe, you know better
[07:49:21] <Cork> might be worth trying to find the original
[07:49:37] <Omar-> i'll try now
[07:51:23] <Omar-> Cork, couldn't find it http://m.imgur.com/js/dist/imgur.mobile.lib.min.js?1425606359
[07:53:00] <Cork> doesn't look like it is open source

[08:08:46] <Lehl0r> that gives me every g where a text varx is contained
[08:08:52] <kavi> Hi I want to pass attributes to a jquery function from a html form . How can i do that ? here is the fidlle that am trying http://jsfiddle.net/y44rotf6/
[08:08:57] <Lehl0r> however i only want the g where it is equal
[08:08:58] <ZadYree> Hello! I'd like to know why, in my JS script, $("foo") is not equal to document.getElementById("foo") ? I'd like to know how to get exactly the same value as document.getElementById("foo") with jQuery.
[08:09:00] <kavi> please help
[08:09:12] <Lehl0r> is there an equals function ?
[08:11:50] <LiENUS> so whats hot in the comet servers world?
[08:15:21] <NoiseEee> didnt that world end already?
[08:15:57] <LiENUS> NoiseEee, is there some reason it would have?
[08:16:24] <NoiseEee> well generally its a websockets world
[08:17:14] <NoiseEee> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/websockets/basics/
[08:17:24] <NoiseEee> also https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/WebSockets
[08:18:50] <LiENUS> NoiseEee, not sure how the transport is relevant
[08:19:06] <LiENUS> its still push vs pull
[08:19:22] <NoiseEee> are you asking for a push tech/server solution?
[08:19:41] <LiENUS> im wondering what works well with jquery
[08:19:49] <LiENUS> for doing the comet design pattern
[08:19:53] <NoiseEee> its not really about jquery
[08:20:38] <NoiseEee> there's nothing in particular in jquery that 'works with' the pattern really
[08:21:06] <NoiseEee> thought a popular and easy set-up is Node and socket.io for implementation.
[08:22:00] <LiENUS> sadly the node database drivers for my server lack event support
[08:22:52] <NoiseEee> but you would use socket.io to pickup/listen to the event, and then you;d do your thing
[08:23:02] <maxvi> I use dropkick for form elements and I want to change value of some select programmatically in jQuery anybody know how can I do that ?
[08:23:15] <NoiseEee> have a peek at http://socket.io/ LiENUS
[08:23:59] <LiENUS> it would be an awful lot of work to write an entire database driver in javascript just to be able to listen for database events
[08:24:25] <NoiseEee> LiENUS: perhaps you should explain what you're after more clearly, as that is not what i am suggesting in the least.
[08:24:33] <NoiseEee> what problem are you trying to solve?
[08:24:40] <LiENUS> <LiENUS> sadly the node database drivers for my server lack event support
[08:24:47] <NoiseEee> what does that even mean?
[08:25:04] <LiENUS> it means the database drivers for my database server do not support events
[08:25:18] <NoiseEee> and how is that problem manifesting itself ?
[08:25:23] <NoiseEee> you are unable to do what?
[08:25:46] <LiENUS> i would think database events in the context of comet is pretty self explanatory
[08:25:51] <NoiseEee> good luck!
[08:25:59] <LiENUS> i feel you need more luck than i do
[08:32:11] <kavi> Is it possible to add functions to a selector that is there in another page in a site on onclick or onsubmit function?
[08:33:46] <BinaryKitten> kavi can you break that down a bit more for us please?
[08:35:17] <kavi>  <BinaryKitten> : i am not sure how to write fiddle for this .. but here is the code  http://pastebin.com/c2WS6Vpw
[08:35:57] <kavi> in the code as u can see, on the form submit am trying a basic addclass to a selector that is there in another page
[08:43:05] <oste> i am facing a problem where $('.item').width(); is too wide b/c the scroll bar is not present yet
[08:43:35] <oste> so on load it is 45px wide but after that is is only 30px
[08:43:45] <oste> the scrollbar is 15px
[08:43:47] <LiENUS> kavi, it sounds like you're trying to either modify the dom of a document you havent loaded yet or is loaded in another browser window/tab from the one you are executing the javascript in
[08:43:49] <LiENUS> is this correct?
[08:44:10] <oste> it is in the same tab
[08:44:26] <oste> the dom should be loaded b/c everything is inside $(function() {
[08:44:36] <oste> no iframes or anything
[08:44:40] <LiENUS> oste, i was talking to kavi
[08:44:46] <kavi> <LiENUS> : yes . correct .. am trying to modify the element in another tab
[08:44:47] <oste> haha ok
[08:45:06] <LiENUS> kavi, no you can't do that in fact most of what javascript does is make sure you can't do that
[08:47:20] <kavi> Is there any other way to do this ? i want basically to take attributes values from a form and apply to jquery function to an element that is loaded else where
[08:48:19] <LiENUS> kavi, not in javascript
[08:48:25] <LiENUS> and likely not at all in the manner you expect
[08:50:11] <kavi> <LiENUS>: Do you know if i can do this in php or something like that ?
[08:51:27] <LiENUS> kavi, not modifying an already loaded page
[08:51:42] <kavi> it can also be like it can modify the element when the function can loads the page  but has to be predefined somewhere else ..
[08:51:50] <LiENUS> you could redirect to the page in question and pass a querystring containing the data then either using js on the client or php on the server modify the page based on that querystring
[08:51:50] <NoiseEee> what problem are you trying to solve kavi?
[08:52:27] <hrusti> how do I format string? e.g. format('hello {1}', world) I want to output hello world
[08:52:30] <hrusti> ?
[08:54:00] <LiENUS> hrusti, i dont believe javascript has that functionality built in, you'd have to build it yourself
[08:54:20] <LiENUS> you could modify the string prototype to include a format function, or just write a format function that takes a string as first argument
[08:54:51] <kavi>  <NoiseEee>  : So, I have a form that collects several attributes required for a jquery function and it also collects the id of a selector . When i submit the form, i am calling a jquery function with the attributes specified in the form to the id in the form . When ever the page with the id loads it should apply the jquery function
[08:54:55] <kavi> makes sense ?
[08:55:44] <LiENUS> kavi, yo could either store those values in a cookie or pass them as a querty string to the other page
[08:56:04] <LiENUS> the cookie will only work if they are running in the same context (ie on the same domain effectively)
[08:56:13] <LiENUS> then have jquery running on the second page
[08:56:47] <LiENUS> and have some javascript to read either the cookie or the query string (or now that i think of it you would probably put this in a hashtag not query string) and apply the values according to it
[08:56:57] <LiENUS> you have to pass a message somehow between the two contexts
[08:57:08] <LiENUS> AND have control over the second page to be able to apply your own code
[08:57:19] <LiENUS> you can't generally apply your own javascript to another page outside of your control
[08:57:42] <LiENUS> there are some minor exceptions, security vulnerabilities, greasemonkey and the like
[08:57:58] <LiENUS> though one might argue if you can load greasemonkey technically the other page is under your control no matter what
[08:59:44] <kavi> <LiENUS> : Storing this cookie or hastag sounds interesting .. querystring will be weird because i will have so many attributes
[08:59:59] <LiENUS> hashtag is going to be about like querystring
[09:00:36] <LiENUS> modern javascript does also support datastorage functionality above and beyond cookies now that i think of it as well
[09:00:51] <LiENUS> it would probably fit the bill as well
[09:00:57] <LiENUS> it's not something i've ever needed or used
[09:02:03] <kavi> oh ok .. then probably cookie . so if i understand u correctly i have store the attributes,id of the selector in the cookie and when the document load read the cookie and apply the jquery function to that id witht he attributes rite ?
[09:03:21] <LiENUS> sure
[09:03:40] <LiENUS> storing the the actual selector would probably be wise
[09:03:45] <LiENUS> then you can reuse the same code for other porpoises
[09:04:36] <kavi> ok . i have not used cookies ..  do u have any examples u know on top of ur head .. if not . no problem i can search for them
[09:06:27] <Es0teric> can anyone tell me what is wrong with this?  $('.mag_image').append( $("<img/>").attr({ width: 300, height: 300, src: data.imgUrl }) ); it doesnt create the image src
[09:07:08] <LiENUS> kavi, javascript is roughly 1/20th of my job tbh if im doing something in javascript im not familiar with my go to is to look for a jquery plugin to do it
[09:07:30] <LiENUS> then i either tear down the plugin if its simple enough and learn how its done or i just use the plugin if its not a trivial piece of code
[09:08:12] <kavi> ok thanks .. will try n see
[09:10:43] <oste> anyone know why the scrollbar is not there on document.ready?

Usually i get the first event correct and then a second event that comes from the document
[09:15:50] <Es0teric> is there any way to target .append() to insert after a specific element?

[09:34:07] <ThePendulum> Uhkis: I was hoping for a more elegant solution
[09:34:43] <ThePendulum> I'm setting the value to '', how does that comma even make it there
[09:34:50] <mbrzuzy> Es0teric, you don't need it inside the append()
[09:34:50] <ThePendulum> there's no comma in '' :S
[09:34:56] <mbrzuzy> Just use $("<img/>").attr({ width: 300, height: 300, src: "http://placehold.it/300x300" }).insertAfter($('.mag_image h3'));
[09:35:15] <mbrzuzy> http://jsfiddle.net/wj7mrw8t/1/
[09:35:21] <ThePendulum> Uhkis: oh, I think I get it
[09:36:11] <Es0teric> mbrzuzy ohhh ok now i get it
[09:36:13] <Es0teric> thanks man
[09:36:59] <ThePendulum> oh, turns out I still don't
[09:39:04] <Uhkis> ThePendulum: var tag = $('#uploadTags').val(); tag.replace(',', ''); tags.push(tag);
[09:39:28] <ThePendulum> Uhkis: the comma ends up in the input, not in the tag
[09:39:40] <ThePendulum> I don't even know why it actually does -not- end up in the tag
[09:40:22] <randomguy> ThePendulum: have you tried preventing the event on key down?  I believe doing that would cause the , to not actually be added to the value
[09:40:33] <ThePendulum> randomguy: I think that's my problem
[09:40:38] <ThePendulum> it's triggered on keydown
[09:40:39] <mbrzuzy> No problem
[09:40:42] <ThePendulum> should be keyup
[09:40:52] <ThePendulum> but keyup doesn't accept backspace
[09:41:14] <Es0teric> mbrzuzy does .empty() empty out the contents in  a div?
[09:41:18] <ThePendulum> hence I went with keydown, which keeps the comma in the input after clearing it, as it gets added after the .val('')
[09:41:27] <mbrzuzy> Es0teric, i'm not sure, i'd check jquery's website
[09:41:33] <ThePendulum> I guess I need to separate those events
[09:41:57] <cjohnson> yeah it does ThePendulum http://jsfiddle.net/kc0pyqvt/
[09:42:09] <Uhkis> ThePendulum: oh, right. then you could just $('#uploadTags').val('');
[09:42:31] <cjohnson> I get this when I hit backspace on the input: Triggered! 0:8
[09:42:51] <ThePendulum> Uhkis: Yeah, and -then- I need to filter the comma from the tag. I had -everything- on keydown now which means the comma doesn't end up in the tag to begin with because the jQuery gets executed before the comma gets placed in the input field
[09:43:32] <randomguy> ThePendulum: did you try e.preventDefault() ?  That's what i mean by preventing the event on keydown
[09:43:40] <cjohnson> ^
[09:44:58] <ThePendulum> randomguy: this would stop the comma from being inserted into the input after the jquery is triggered?
[09:45:07] <rubyonrailed> I wan't to check if the value is equal to any of these letters. Not all of them.  `  if ($(this).val() == ["E", "F", "H", "K", "L"])`  How can I make that work without making multiple "ors"
[09:45:21] <randomguy> ThePendulum: preventDefault() on an event stops it from bubbling up the dom
[09:45:45] <randomguy> ThePendulum: which in the case of a key event, would cause following actions such as the actual insertion into the value
[09:45:50] <Clint0n> anyone?
[09:46:12] <ThePendulum> randomguy: that seems to work, cheers
[09:46:27] <randomguy> ThePendulum: you would only want to do that on enter or comma, however, so it doesn't break keys other than those
[09:46:31] <ThePendulum> and it's a bit faster than replacing the comma when adding the tag
[09:46:42] <cjohnson> rubyonrailed: regex. if $(this).val().match(/[EFHKL]/)
[09:46:52] <ThePendulum> randomguy: yeah, that's what it does now, while triggering everything with keydown
[09:46:56] <cjohnson> rubyonrailed: do you want the value to be only one character? or only contain those characters?
[09:46:59] <ThePendulum> (so it can include backspaces)
[09:47:07] <randomguy> ThePendulum: there ya go
[09:47:10] <randomguy> ThePendulum: :)
[09:47:40] <cjohnson> ThePendulum: again, backspaces happen on keyup as I demonstrated to you above
[09:48:39] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: huh, odd
[09:48:51] <rubyonrailed> cjohnson: The value can be any one of those letters, but it will never be more than one letter
[09:48:53] <ThePendulum> I tried this yesterday, it didn't work. I looked it up, everyone reported it indeed wouldn't work
[09:49:04] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: I get the idea jQuery might not be mapping it properly?
[09:49:08] <ThePendulum> as you are using vanilla JS
[09:49:36] <cjohnson> rubyonrailed: then you want if ( $(this).val().match(/^[EFHKL]$/) ){ /* it's only one character and only one of those allowed */ }
[09:49:42] <cjohnson> make it $/i if you want it to be case insensitive
[09:49:57] <cjohnson> ThePendulum: nope jquery just maps to the vanilla js event handlers
[09:49:59] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: odd, I -do- get it now
[09:50:03] <cjohnson> I can make a fiddle if you don't believe it ;)
[09:50:07] <ThePendulum> I don't know what was happening yesterday then
[09:50:16] <ThePendulum> and what these people were on about
[09:50:17] <cjohnson> always happens like that heh
[09:50:27] <cjohnson> rubber duck programming
[09:50:30] <cjohnson> debugging
[09:50:45] <Clint0n> Hi all, just written some jQuery to toggle some sections on and off http://dev1.eclarity.it/customer-care-team/ - When clicking the Orders the first time the "returns" section does not get toggled as expected, however when I click it again it does get toggled?? I have put IF statements in to try and stop this issue but it is almost like it is ignoring the IF statement or somehow it is evaluating to true. Here is my JS: http://pastebin.com/0B
[09:50:45] <Clint0n> 1WA2DD
[09:50:47] <Clint0n> broken link: http://pastebin.com/0B1WA2DD
[09:51:59] <Clint0n> Strangely it does not do it with the Returns toggle, only the Orders toggle
[09:52:12] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: odd, keyup has the exact opposite action than I'd expect. Whenever I have [tag1][tag2]hello and I removed 'ello', it removes tag2 the moment I remove the remaining 'h'
[09:52:30] <ThePendulum> keydown does exactly what I want, remove the 'h' of hello first, and the next hit removes tag2
[09:53:20] <cjohnson> it goes keydown -> if that doesn't return false, the letter is added -> keyup -> change
[09:53:26] <cjohnson> change might only happen on blur
[09:54:18] <cjohnson> Clint0n: if you're using an if statement like that, just use hide/show explicitly
[09:54:27] <cjohnson> also don't use 2 ifs with inverted conditions. merge those into if/else
[09:54:42] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: which effectively removes the letter from the DOM -and- then continues to remove the tag following it
[09:54:56] <ThePendulum> not quite desired :( luckily keydown does what I am expecting
[09:55:29] <Clint0n> cjohnson: ah so use .show and .hide rather than the toggle function?
[09:55:31] <t1> Clint0n, hide all on beginning
[09:55:35] <rubyonrailed> cjohnson: Thanks!
[09:55:44] <cjohnson> ThePendulum: well not knowing what your code is it's hard to tell what's going on... ;)
[09:56:06] <t1> Clint0n, then it works with toggle as well
[09:56:12] <cjohnson> Clint0n: exactly. toggle is if you don't want an if statement. but the if/else is better imo since it will work predictably regardless of default state
[09:57:16] <Clint0n> t1: Trouble is ideally I want the orders section to be shown when navigating to the page otherwise the footer does not stay at the botttom, looks unprofessional
[09:57:26] <Clint0n> cjohnson: Cheers mate, will give it a go
[09:58:00] <MalMen> what url should i use to test scripts ?
[09:58:24] <MalMen> http://jsfiddle.net/ got it :)
[09:59:34] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: http://pastie.org/private/ylwwokmgibo4utszvir8zw at the moment
[09:59:57] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: that 'tag' argument for that function is obsolete, just noticed
[10:00:09] <ThePendulum> oh nvm it's not
[10:00:19] <ThePendulum> oh it is* :P
[10:00:42] <randomguy> ThePendulum: remove it and see what breaks, >:-D
[10:01:20] <ThePendulum> I did, nothing broke!
[10:01:51] <cjohnson> cool if it works then go with it. seems to work okay to me
[10:01:53] <ThePendulum> I see a flaw though, that explains why I sometimes can't directly remove tags; I'm not checking the length of the tags array before adding it; even if no more tags are allowed to be added, it adds them to the array but simply doesn't display them
[10:02:22] <cjohnson> except your limit of 6 doesn't seem to work
[10:02:27] <cjohnson> yeah
[10:02:36] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: it does in the UI, but not in the code, yeah
[10:02:54] <ThePendulum> I'm limiting it at the wrong place
[10:02:59] <cjohnson> mhm exactly
[10:03:25] <microhaxo> Is it possible to make this more efficient memory and cpu wise? return self._ele.find('.div-scale:visible').find(".idf-page");
[10:03:50] <cjohnson> don't prematurely optimize
[10:04:07] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: moved that whole check block to the point they're actually being added; works better now :p
[10:04:13] <cjohnson> if it works and is readable and maintainable, leave it until you have specific reason to believe it runs exceptionally poorly
[10:04:24] <cjohnson> ThePendulum: awesome! I would also add the palceholder on page load
[10:04:27] <microhaxo> It is a little slow with over 5k items.
[10:04:41] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: which placeholder? there's already one on the HTML tag by default
[10:04:44] <cjohnson> right, the DOM is slow microhaxo
[10:04:54] <cjohnson> so limit the number of times you run that command if you can, but otherwise
[10:04:56] <cjohnson> don't worry about it
[10:05:03] <cjohnson> ThePendulum: ah good then, that's all I meant
[10:05:05] <microhaxo> Yea i figured so, i was just wondering if i could squeeze out any more perf.
[10:05:16] <oste> anyone ever experienced issues with .width() not accounting for the scroll bar???
[10:05:17] <microhaxo> Memory usage is close to 1gb as well
[10:05:30] <ThePendulum> oste: the window's scroll bar?
[10:05:35] <cjohnson> it's pretty hard to account for the browser scroll bar
[10:05:36] <oste> yes
[10:05:38] <cjohnson> there's no consistent way
[10:05:41] <oste> FML
[10:05:42] <ThePendulum> oste: you'd have to account for it manually
[10:05:43] <cjohnson> you should be using percentages and such anyway
[10:05:53] <ThePendulum> the scrollbar is technically not part of the DOM
[10:05:55] <cjohnson> there's no reason to be that pixel-specific
[10:05:56] <ThePendulum> at least not that one
[10:06:01] <oste> ok on document.ready it is not there
[10:06:10] <ThePendulum> because it's not in the document afaik
[10:06:17] <cjohnson> use percentages and let CSS figure it out
[10:06:28] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: you can see the tagger in effect here; http://passon.memody.com/new
[10:06:39] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: only issue is that it overflows when you add long tags; but that's a CSS one
[10:06:53] <ThePendulum> at least mostly
[10:09:09] <cjohnson> oste: scrollbars aren't consistent, it's up to your window manager. in some themes in linux it's not even part of the window. in os x, it's visually part of the web page but it disappears. in windows it's permanently there on the side of the window
[10:09:28] <cjohnson> so there's no predictable way to account for that. which is why you just use width: 100% or left: 0; right: 0; or something like that
[10:09:44] <ThePendulum> I wish I had more success styling scrollbars, I have a double one that I wish looked a bit lighter
[10:10:23] <microhaxo> what is the best practice to keep the ui thread mostly responsive on long running javascript tasks?
[10:10:34] <MalMen> jquery-ui problem, this function gets me to -> http://jsfiddle.net/Lmuj5gyj/ -> this strange dialog when i first click on it, after close the dialog the second time everything works great -> http://postimg.org/image/riligco0z/6d889353/
[10:10:44] <cjohnson> anything heavy should be broken up into ticks with setTimeout or other async operations microhaxo
[10:11:05] <cjohnson> instead of synchronously calculating 10k things, break it up into 4ms chunks allowing the rest of hte thread time to breath
[10:11:36] <microhaxo> cjohnson, i have some settimeouts set but i have to append html to the dom and i believe it locks up the ui thread for about ~ 1 second
[10:12:16] <cjohnson> batch your dom operations
[10:12:23] <ThePendulum> I remember writing a chat throttle with setTimeout until I realized it'd be much prettier to keep an array of the time in milliseconds of a specific range of past messages. Like a trajectory control.
[10:12:25] <randomguy> microhaxo: are you appending to the dom every time, or are you using a fragment and append that to the dom at the end?
[10:12:29] <cjohnson> instead of doing 1000 insertions, build the final output in a string and make it one insertion
[10:12:56] <cjohnson> ThePendulum: _.debounce and _.throttle are really handy for that sort of stuff
[10:13:05] <Omar-> anyone knows a good tutorial of handling two finger touch?
[10:13:05] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/amyseqmedia/dD99u/37/
[10:13:08] <microhaxo> I am collecting a large chunk, then appending to the dom
[10:13:09] <Omar-> fingers*
[10:13:22] <cjohnson> microhaxo: a single insertion won't lock up the ui thread for a second
[10:13:24] <Omar-> or a good js library
[10:13:28] <cjohnson> make a fiddle or link to your page
[10:13:28] <microhaxo> but it happens about 10 times
[10:13:37] <cjohnson> ok well that's what I'm saying. stop doing that
[10:13:38] <cjohnson> batch it
[10:13:39] <microhaxo> Basically i am pulling in 10 pages of content at a time, then appending to the dom.
[10:13:48] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: oh ffs >_<
[10:13:48] <cjohnson> make it one insertion
[10:13:58] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: about 90% of what I worked on in the past months turns out to be a lodash function
[10:14:01] <ThePendulum> lol
[10:14:13] <cjohnson> underscore* but yeah such is life
[10:14:22] <ThePendulum> well it's also part of lodash
[10:14:23] <Guest39607> hi, i have a problem,i have dynamically generated listview,when i press backbutton and come back to the same page effects are gone,when i inspect it i see that all the classes are removed..what to do?
[10:14:29] <cjohnson> I wrote a cool little wrapper to chaining async operations neatly only to discover promises
[10:14:44] <randomguy> microhaxo: another alternative would be, if your able to, to not load all 10 pages at one time, but load additional pages as the user scrolls down, similar to a few popular sites around
[10:14:58] <microhaxo> I load 10 pages first, then i have a set timeout of 2 seconds, then i recursively call my self to ajax in another 10 pages until i have reached my total page count. Every 10 pages gets appended to the dom.
[10:15:20] <ThePendulum> cjohnson: not sure if lodash/underscore's implementation offers everything I need though
[10:15:23] <Omar-> Guest39607 jquery mobile?
[10:15:27] <cjohnson> the lazy loading is a better approach microhaxo
[10:15:31] <Guest39607> Omar-: yes
[10:15:32] <cjohnson> wait until it's actually needed
[10:15:38] <cjohnson> 10 pages is enough buffer for the user not to notice it
[10:15:48] <Omar-> Guest39607 are you using single page model? each page in a separate HTML?
[10:15:55] <microhaxo> Well the document has to be fully loaded, this approach was so that they could atleast see some of the document first instead of a spinning wheel of waiting for ever.
[10:16:10] <cjohnson> you can make it fully load as they scroll down
[10:16:11] <Omar-> if yes, add data-dom-cache="true" to <div data-role="page"> of that page
[10:16:15] <Omar-> Guest39607 ^^
[10:16:22] <cjohnson> if you have a few pages of buffer it will be seamless. as if it had all loaded up front
[10:16:25] <cjohnson> without the overhead
[10:16:36] <microhaxo> however, if they scroll during this loading time, they get fluid response for ~2 seconds then 1 second of lockup then 2 seconds of fluid etc until its done loading entirely.
[10:16:47] <cjohnson> microhaxo: please make a fiddle. or link to your page, if you want specific suggestions
[10:16:54] <cjohnson> it sounds like you're doing something wrong, it shouldn't lock anything up
[10:17:08] <cjohnson> one insertion, even a big one, doesn't take a second
[10:17:19] <Omar-> e.g. foo.html => <div data-role="page" data-dom-cache="true"> <listview> </div> Guest39607
[10:17:27] <microhaxo> Right but isn't that the same thing im  doing, if im loading content while they scroll (NOT because they are scrolling) it locks up a bit, i would encounter the same problem if i loaded because they are scrolling.
[10:17:31] <microhaxo> how do i prevent the lockup
[10:17:39] <Guest39607> no,i am using a data-role =page  ,there is only one html file
[10:17:53] <cjohnson> microhaxo: again, paste what you've got, there *shouldn't* be a lockup for a single insertion
[10:17:54] <Omar-> Guest39607 all pages in one HTML file?
[10:18:03] <cjohnson> so you're doing something else wrong
[10:18:04] <Guest39607> yes
[10:18:20] <Omar-> Guest39607 weird, can you create a fiddle?
[10:18:27] <Omar-> it shouldn't happen
[10:18:53] <Guest39607> yes
[10:18:58] <Omar-> i'll be right back
[10:19:06] <microhaxo> cjohnson here is what i've got. http://pastie.org/10016638
[10:19:39] <cjohnson> need all of it
[10:19:47] <cjohnson> you call appendAdditionalContent but it's not defined here
[10:20:02] <microhaxo> that would be thousands and thousands of lines + 600mb pdf files
[10:20:09] <cjohnson> you call appendAdditionalContent but it's not defined here
[10:20:18] <cjohnson> don't be obtuse
[10:21:19] <microhaxo> cjohnson here is additonal content: http://pastie.org/10016647
[10:22:29] <cjohnson> what's the setTimeout for?
[10:22:52] <cjohnson> and what is self._ele? these are the kinds of things I want a more complete paste for ;)
[10:22:52] <microhaxo> nothing, i was randomly adding them to see if it would give the UI time to update.
[10:23:05] <cjohnson> link to the page?
[10:23:09] <microhaxo> self._ele is a reference to a jquery object (a div)
[10:23:24] <cjohnson> alright well then you're making multiple insertions
[10:23:27] <cjohnson> right
[10:23:32] <cjohnson> you're doing the appends in a loop
[10:23:42] <cjohnson> unless that div isn't attached to the DOM yet?
[10:23:46] <cjohnson> document*
[10:24:33] <cjohnson> other than that, there's no reason you should expect this to cause a lockup when it happens on scroll
[10:24:36] <microhaxo> all of those aren't attached yet, EXCEPT for self._ele so good catch on that one.
[10:25:05] <cjohnson> as long as you load enough pages in advance that they can scroll quickly
[10:25:27] <cjohnson> if you get that down to 1 insert and it's still really slow I'd have to say your pages are too big then
[10:26:37] <cjohnson> the realHtml business makes no sense either, you're adding it to a div only to search it and then discard it
[10:27:07] <microhaxo> Well here is the thing, i am loading these pages and as i scroll they are fluid for my call to  setTimeout(function () { self.LoadAdditionalContent(); }, 1000);  you see on the first page, as soon as that timeout runs out it locks up for about 1 second then the settimeout fires again.
[10:27:34] <cjohnson> link to a working page?
[10:27:47] <cjohnson> you've leaving too much to guess for me to say what's going on
[10:27:54] <microhaxo> cjohnson that was done because if i wrap rawhtml in jquery selector, it actually truncates a lot of the html. By wrapping it in a div it removes only the outer div leaving my rawhtml whole.
[10:28:15] <cjohnson> no it doesn't truncate it, we figured this out yesterday
[10:28:42] <microhaxo> more than half of the html is gone because it ignores the parent
[10:28:43] <cjohnson> your HTML has multiple top-level elements and you were trying to operate on only one of them (such as using .html() on the collection for instance)
[10:28:47] <microhaxo> so i had to wrap it
[10:28:49] <randomguy> is $() smart enough to know the inner object is already a jquery object.  noticed he is also double wrapping his realhtml and chunkhtml
[10:29:13] <cjohnson> it's not ignoring the parent it's ignoring the second top-level div because you used a method that expected only one node, .html
[10:29:56] <cjohnson> notice how it only gets a here: http://jsfiddle.net/rwf0401o/
[10:30:08] <microhaxo> what method would be appropriate for that then?
[10:30:10] <microhaxo> is there a
[10:30:14] <microhaxo> All html?
[10:30:34] <cjohnson> don't use methods expecting only one node. or use them inside a loop
[10:30:45] <cjohnson> $(html).length is 3 in my fiddle
[10:32:19] <cjohnson> check this out microhaxo http://api.jquery.com/andself/
[10:32:56] <microhaxo> Thank you, i've never seen that before. What i needed yesterday. lol
[10:33:10] <cjohnson> guess it's deprecated in favor of addBack (same thing)
[10:35:38] <cjohnson> maybe that's not what you want. what you have works I guess. anyway I'd have to see a working page to give you a better idea of what's causing the lockup
[10:35:46] <cjohnson> you could use your debugger btw and step through it all
[10:35:49] <cjohnson> or a profiler
[10:38:12] <Guest39607> can anyone help me please?i am using jquery mobile,i have generated listview dynamically on some page,when i press back button from that page and return to that page again all jquery classes are removed only the html i have generated dynamically is retained
[10:41:51] <Guest39607> someone there?
[10:42:46] <tasaif> patience
[10:44:23] <microhaxo> Could it be that the ajax is what's blocking my thread?
[10:45:36] <tasaif> Guest39607: can you put your problem in the form of a fiddle?
[10:49:28] <Guest39607> tasaif: there are many files,i have just put important part of code here http://jsfiddle.net/gh2ow5k9/
[10:50:34] <tasaif> Is this fiddle demonstrating the problem?
[10:52:31] <Guest39607> sorry but i cant demonstrate the problem,i am using many librarys,i just posted code which dynamically generates list view, basically the problem is in a multipage template when i click back button and come back all the styling done by jquery mobile(as seen the first time i opened page) is removed
[10:54:56] <Guest39607> when i first opened a page these classes were automatically added ui-li ui-li-divider ui-bar-b ui-first-child to list view but i when press back button and return i only see what i generated using script these classes which were added before are not added again
[10:59:29] <Guest39607> tasaif: any idea?
[11:00:01] <tasaif> I've never used jquery mobile
[11:00:46] <tasaif> are you making sure to call the same functions on the new elements as when you initialize the page?
[11:01:23] <tasaif> for example if you have a div.slider and you $('.slider').slider()
[11:01:36] <tasaif> then you remove it and put a new one, do you make sure to $('.slider').slider() again?
[11:02:02] <cjohnson> microhaxo: ajax is async. so no.
[11:02:16] <cjohnson> microhaxo: again if you want us to help further you'll have to link to a live page.
[11:24:49] <gannies> how can i convert this into a string? var obj = { tokenExpires: Date.now() + 3600000 }
[11:25:02] <cjohnson> JSON.stringify to turn objects into strings
[11:25:09] <tasaif> take it to a temple
[11:25:14] <gannies> cjohnson: yeah but also the keys
[11:25:18] <cjohnson> yes it includes the key
[11:25:24] <gannies> wont work
[11:25:46] <cjohnson> yes it does: http://jsfiddle.net/dqunddq2/
[11:25:51] <cjohnson> I get {"tokenExpires":1426015534013}  in the console
[11:25:58] <hrusti> I have table with number fixed to 8 decimals. What is the best way to change color to trailing zeros?
[11:26:16] <gannies> cjohnson: wont work if i need to store those values
[11:26:28] <cjohnson> gannies: clarify what you mean please
[11:26:33] <cjohnson> you can store a string just fine
[11:26:45] <cjohnson> then when you fetch it back out, new Date() the value to get a Date back
[11:27:26] <gannies> cjohnson: but i dont want to stringify the keys
[11:27:37] <tasaif> hrusti: what do you mean?
[11:28:05] <cjohnson> gannies: then you need to clarify what you mean
[11:28:13] <centrx> Why is there no source code in the docs?
[11:28:29] <gannies> cjohnson: is there any other way?
[11:28:44] <cjohnson> gannies: any other way to do what
[11:28:50] <cjohnson> you haven't clarified what your goal is
[11:29:08] <cjohnson> centrx: because the source code is in the source code. it's on github: https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[11:29:11] <gannies> cjohnson: i need to convert only the value into a string
[11:29:27] <hrusti> tasaif: if number 0.1 is in table I show it like 0.10000000. Now I want to have color red for 0.1 and color green for rest of zeros 0000000
[11:29:40] <cjohnson> gannies: ok then JSON.stringify(obj.tokenExpires) which is mostly redundant
[11:29:50] <cjohnson> gannies: tell me what you're *actually* trying to do
[11:36:07] <tasaif> hrusti: I would separate the content into two spans
[11:37:23] <hrusti> tasaif me too, but I process these numbers alot so it could get heavy to handle
[11:40:44] <hrusti> or maybe can I process it, convert it to string then check if last char is '0' I iterate from end an to first non-zero char and add zeros to separate span
[11:42:45] <tasaif> you could
[11:42:54] <cjohnson> spitting a number into two spans shouldn't be heavy to handle
[11:43:02] <cjohnson> unless you have millions of them?
[11:43:42] <tasaif> hrusti: maybe you could use regex to split it
[11:43:59] <hrusti> cjohnson: I dont mean like hevy for browser just for my logic :)
[11:44:02] <voidwalkr> what would be the usefulness of placing an img into canvas?
[11:44:05] <hrusti> tasaif: e.g. ?
[11:44:09] <cjohnson> hrusti: what you said sounds like it would work great
[11:44:12] <cjohnson> you got this
[11:44:17] <tasaif> nope, I'm not a regex expert
[11:45:04] <tasaif> maybe you could write a function that calls another function that recursively calculates the zeros then unwraps the content and rewraps with what you need
[11:45:23] <tasaif> throw some while loops in there with some case statements and you'll be all set
[11:48:06] <cjohnson> hrusti: does your output already contain the correct number of trailing 0s?
[11:48:16] <cjohnson> or are you trying to pad them in js as well?
[11:51:51] <tasaif> hrusti: f.toPrecision(6).split(/0*$/)
[11:51:57] <tasaif> that gives you the first part of the number
[11:52:55] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/srbwzgy9/
[11:52:57] <tasaif> s.match(/0*$/) gives you the second part
[11:53:56] <hrusti> tasaif: k, tnx
[11:54:24] <cjohnson> smart thinkin tasaif
[11:55:15] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/srbwzgy9/1/
[11:55:28] <tasaif> cjohnson: I updated your code to use the regexes
[11:55:46] <tasaif> thanks for doing all the heavy work
[11:55:48] <tasaif> :p
[11:56:26] <cjohnson> hah

[11:59:27] <rubyonrailed> When i'm using "check_box" form helper tag it's spliting my returned json up, but when I use "radio_button" the json is normal.  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b91fcd51bac0aa7390f4  Does anyone know why this is happening?

[12:01:41] <tasaif> sorry, #rubyonrails

[12:05:37] <tasaif> kundan: #jquery-dev
[12:07:37] <HeyBro1> Guys how can i send a file from an Ajax Request ?
[12:08:41] <HeyBro1> I have to use FormData() ?
[12:12:35] <cjohnson> HeyBro1: https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=formdata%20upload
[12:28:17] <testerbit> how can I open a modal defined in html on click?
[12:29:24] <arup_r> I don't want to do the Ajax call when data is empty.. how to do so ? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/b681a96ba4fbd66115f2#file-calender-js-L137
[12:29:24] <NoiseEee> testerbit: it would depend on the modal library you're using i guess, but what do you mean?
[12:30:14] <tasaif> $( ".selector" ).dialog( "open" );
[12:30:23] <tasaif> straight out of the doc http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-open
[12:30:45] <hrusti> how do I append two jquery elements on same level? not <div><div></div></div> but <div></div><div></div>
[12:31:32] <tasaif> hrusti: can you make a jsfiddle of the scenario?
[12:31:57] <cjohnson> arup_r: use an if statement around the ajax call
[12:32:21] <cjohnson> if (data) { return $.ajax(...) } else { return null; /* or whatever  */ }
[12:32:41] <cjohnson> but it would never be empty here. you define it on the line above
[12:33:08] <arup_r> I am thinking what should I put inside the else part too
[12:33:24] <arup_r> means?
[12:33:36] <arup_r> data can be empty sometimes....
[12:33:49] <cjohnson> not in the code you pasted
[12:33:56] <cjohnson> you define it and on the very next line you use it
[12:34:03] <cjohnson> in no scenario would data ever be empty in your paste
[12:34:21] <arup_r> I got error... because ajax  is calling with empty data and DB is giving error.. so I want to stop ajax call when data is empty
[12:34:38] <cjohnson> you either pasted the wrong code or are misunderstanding the error
[12:35:05] <arup_r> No.. check this function https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/b681a96ba4fbd66115f2#file-calender-js-L69-L87
[12:35:19] <hrusti> tasaif: https://jsfiddle.net/awg1aemy/2/
[12:35:29] <Es0teric> can anyone help me with this? http://pastebin.com/Nv7FphPQ
[12:35:40] <Es0teric> for some reason the $.post is executing twice
[12:35:49] <arup_r> ok sorry
[12:35:50] <hrusti> tasaif I dont want bar to be child of foo but sibling
[12:35:56] <arup_r> if dates are empty https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/b681a96ba4fbd66115f2#file-calender-js-L132
[12:36:19] <arup_r> cjohnson:
[12:36:54] <cjohnson> ok. then yeah, what I said
[12:36:58] <cjohnson> use an if check
[12:37:05] <cjohnson> to check that data.dates isn't empty
[12:38:02] <arup_r> what should I return in the else part ? cjohnson :
[12:38:18] <cjohnson> how would I know? it's up to you
[12:38:34] <notchris> How do I remove inlined html properties
[12:38:36] <notchris> in example
[12:38:36] <arup_r> :p that's true
[12:38:39] <Es0teric> anyone?
[12:38:43] <notchris> <div width=“100”></div>
[12:38:58] <cjohnson> notchris: http://api.jquery.com/removeattr/
[12:39:06] <notchris> Ah
[12:39:10] <notchris> So attr to change it
[12:39:12] <cjohnson> or better yet http://api.jquery.com/removeprop/
[12:39:20] <cjohnson> since you should usually be working with props not attrs
[12:39:49] <cjohnson> hrusti: if you want to add another element to a jquery collection, you can use .add
[12:40:11] <cjohnson> if you're wanting to insert another node after a given node on the document, you can use insertAfter
[12:41:23] <arup_r> cjohnson: I am thiking to put it inside a custom function then I will call the function if <cond> true otherwise null
[12:41:33] <arup_r> does it sound good
[12:41:34] <arup_r> ?
[12:41:49] <arup_r> to put it means the full ajax part
[12:42:02] <cjohnson> sure that works too
[12:42:04] <cjohnson> same difference
[12:42:24] <cjohnson> more boilerplate that way, I'd rather just use the if statement in the same method personally. but both work
[12:42:42] <arup_r> ok.. then in the custom function approach
[12:42:50] <arup_r> how would I pass the $ ?
[12:43:54] <cjohnson> I don't understand the question
[12:44:30] <Es0teric> ‹ arup_r ›	 how would I pass the $ ? <-- lolwut?
[12:45:10] <arup_r> Inside the same code I can use $.ajax(..) right? If I move the full code to a custom function.. then if I write $,ajax(,,,) will it work ?
[12:45:26] <Es0teric> arup_r only one way to find out
[12:45:49] <cjohnson> arup_r: well, it won't have access to any variables defined in the first function
[12:45:53] <cjohnson> so you would have to pass those as arguments
[12:45:59] <cjohnson> which is why I said it would be more boilerplate that way
[12:46:17] <arup_r> ok
[12:46:45] <arup_r> so we can
[12:46:49] <Es0teric> on an unrelated note, can anyone help me with this: http://pastebin.com/Nv7FphPQ ?
[12:47:11] <arup_r> we can't pass thw $ as the function argument ? Humm
[12:47:20] <cjohnson> you don't need to $ is global
[12:47:46] <cjohnson> it's the other variables that you declared in the function you would have to pass. such as data
[12:48:53] <cjohnson> I would just do it this way arup_r http://jsfiddle.net/xjheu6g6/
[12:48:56] <arup_r> ok got it
[12:49:18] <cjohnson> lines 126-131 and 138 to see my changes
[12:49:39] <tasaif> hrusti: https://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/awg1aemy/3/
[12:49:40] <tasaif> ???
[12:51:55] <arup_r> cjohnson:  Thats cool
[12:52:27] <arup_r> thanks
[12:52:33] <cjohnson> np
[12:52:55] <arup_r> you made my day
[12:53:07] <arup_r> I was thinking too much
[12:53:33] <cjohnson> actually you prob want this: http://jsfiddle.net/xjheu6g6/1/
[12:53:35] <arup_r> cjohnson: I can now sleep more.. bcoz you have reduced my work :D
[12:53:43] <cjohnson> you're checking isDragging before you define it
[12:53:59] <cjohnson> and my code was running before the filter_kitchen_dates which was my bad
[12:54:29] <cjohnson> maybe. actually I'm not sure what you're doing with that isDragging stuff
[12:54:48] <cjohnson> you define it after you pass it to filter_kitchen_dates
[12:55:05] <cjohnson> oh, nvm, I see now. don't mind me
[12:55:35] <arup_r> yes
[12:55:50] <arup_r> we can make the conditional return  just after the https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/b681a96ba4fbd66115f2#file-calender-js-L135
[12:56:10] <arup_r> right ?
[12:56:39] <cjohnson> sure. if (data.dates.length == 0) { return; }
[12:56:43] <arup_r> sorry after that https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/b681a96ba4fbd66115f2#file-calender-js-L127
[12:57:00] <arup_r> if elements are empty.. then date should be empty
[12:57:05] <arup_r> as per my code
[12:57:15] <arup_r> so I can return if elements are empty
[12:58:29] <arup_r> cjohnson: ^^
[12:59:36] <cjohnson> k
[12:59:48] <arup_r> if (data.dates.length == 0) { return; }is giving an error *illegal return statement* why so ?
[13:00:32] <cjohnson> because you put it before you declared data, probably
[13:01:36] <arup_r> same error from if ([].length == 0) { return; }
[13:01:42] <arup_r> for testing I did
[13:01:53] <cjohnson> [].length == 0 ?? where did you come up with that
[13:02:17] <cjohnson> if you're not sure, just use the paste I gave you: http://jsfiddle.net/xjheu6g6/1/
[13:03:16] <arup_r> as you said data is not defined that's why.. so I am telling you if I write like if ([].length == 0) { return; } then also giving the error.. means kind of syntax error it seems
[13:04:11] <cjohnson> I have no idea where you came up with if([].length == 0)
[13:04:22] <cjohnson> but again, if you're not sure, use the paste I gave you
[13:04:25] <cjohnson> it does what you want
[13:04:40] <arup_r> ok
[13:04:43] <arup_r> one min
[13:05:53] <arup_r> cjohnson: http://goo.gl/jHffL6
[13:07:26] <arup_r> ok it should be ===
[13:07:52] <arup_r> nah still same error
[13:09:38] <cjohnson> for the last time
[13:09:44] <cjohnson> if you can't figure it out, just use the paste I gave you
[13:10:36] <arup_r> ok
[13:11:52] <Aoi> hm .. guys.. does someone know? I am using jQuery UI slider, but its change ("sliderchange" event) triggers for each value (min, max and every subsequential handler); I would like to trigger it only once for min & max ... I wonder if this is possible :x? or am I not supposed to ask jquery ui questions in here?
[13:12:15] <arup_r> cjohnson: http://jsfiddle.net/yh85qf98/
[13:12:35] <arup_r> the error if you run it in the chrome web console
[13:12:50] <arup_r> why not in the JSfiddle I don't know
[13:16:27] <cjohnson> that isn't in the paste that I gave you.
[13:16:40] <cjohnson> stop using your own code if you can't figure it out. use the code I wrote for you.
[13:16:50] <arup_r> ok
[13:17:58] <arup_r> got it .. why was me wrong.. thanks
[13:18:35] <cjohnson> you didn't give me a full paste with your modifications so I have no idea
[13:25:17] <arup_r> I'll give you cjohnson :
[13:25:20] <arup_r> testing
[13:25:35] <cjohnson> well, if it works, I wouldn't worry about it
[13:28:08] <arup_r> works https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/b681a96ba4fbd66115f2#file-calender-js-L136
[13:31:27] <arup_r> cjohnson: Bye... to late here... going to sleep
[14:06:05] <Omar-> hi
[14:24:25] <Aoi> hm is there a particular best-practice (or way) how to publish a jquery ui widget? I have a rather simple thing, but it does what I want...
[14:26:38] <tasaif> try #jqueryui-dev
[14:26:54] <cluelesscoder> hey, my error and success ajax callbacks are both firing - is this stackoverflow comment correct in that sucess and error are replaced by done and fail?
[14:26:55] <Omar-> Aoi what r u trying to do
[14:26:58] <cluelesscoder> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18210769/jquery-ajax-call-firing-both-success-and-error
[14:27:31] <Omar-> tasaif jqueryui-dev is for developing jquery-ui and mobile not meant for help
[14:27:33] <Aoi> http://divstar.no-ip.org/ this combobox
[14:27:52] <cjohnson> cluelesscoder: this is your SO post? that's your code?
[14:27:59] <Aoi> it immitates the combobox for opening and closing and may contain any widgets in the dropdown box
[14:28:01] <cluelesscoder> no, not my code
[14:28:10] <cjohnson> well how can we possibly answer your question then?
[14:28:15] <cluelesscoder> it's a general question
[14:28:28] <tasaif> s/possibly //
[14:28:34] <cluelesscoder> the documentation is unclear as to whether .done and .fail are intended to replace success and error
[14:28:57] <tasaif> done just waits until it's done
[14:29:01] <Omar-> Aoi why not collapsible instead?
[14:29:03] <tasaif> it doesn't care about success or failure
[14:29:10] <Aoi> cluelesscoder - just a guess into the blue ... but does the server-side script responsible for sending a reply perhaps send both a success- and an error-header?
[14:29:18] <Aoi> then again I am not even sure that's possible
[14:29:33] <cluelesscoder> the documentation for jquery ajax says "The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callback methods introduced in jQuery 1.5 are deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead"
[14:29:43] <Aoi> @Omar - I wanted that button and I wanted it to open "on top" of the text/design beneath it
[14:29:56] <cluelesscoder> but I'm not sure this is talking about the options
[14:30:08] <cluelesscoder> good idea Aoi!
[14:30:11] <cjohnson> cluelesscoder: as a general question: no, success and error won't call on the same request
[14:30:23] <tasaif> I am a bold faced liar
[14:30:26] <cjohnson> .success is different from success:
[14:30:36] <Ajkthx> i need someone to help me before i lose my fucking mind
[14:30:40] <Ajkthx> im about to go homicidal
[14:30:43] <cjohnson> and .done/.fail are the deferred interface. success: is still valid
[14:30:50] <Ajkthx> i cannot figure out for the life of me why this plugin will not work
[14:30:52] <Ajkthx> http://www.elpasoconcretecontractor.com/
[14:31:31] <Ajkthx> there is a scroll box function im trying to implement on the bottom right corner of the page, you can see where it's overlapping and whatnot. i've looked at the demo page and tried absolutely everything and nothing is working
[14:32:18] <Ajkthx> the demo page that came with it works, and im doign the EXACT same thing, but it just will absolutely not work
[14:33:14] <Aoi> aren't you missing overflow property on the ul element?
[14:33:28] <jacquerie> Ajkthx, I see a 404 on jquery.simplyscroll.css
[14:33:36] <Aoi> oh hm it itself won't work I suppose
[14:34:28] <Ajkthx> 		<script src="jquery.scrollbox.min.js"></script>
[14:34:32] <Ajkthx> this is the actual file
[14:34:41] <Ajkthx> the other one is another failed attempt at a different plugin
[14:34:45] <Ajkthx> haven tremoved it yet
[14:34:45] <Aoi> that's an obfuscated version of the plugin :x
[14:35:03] <Omar-> <link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery.simplyscroll.css" media="all" type="text/css"> missing
[14:35:18] <Ajkthx> guys
[14:35:25] <Ajkthx> simplyscroll is not the same plugin
[14:35:30] <Ajkthx> different plugin alltogether
[14:38:22] <Omar-> Ajkthx before you commit suicide, which part of the page are you talking about?
[14:38:29] <Omar-> which button?
[14:38:39] <Omar-> in which browser are you testing the code?
[14:39:00] <Aoi> I think he said testimonials (bottom-right)
[14:39:10] <Omar-> i missed that
[14:39:12] <Omar-> thanks Aoi
[14:39:18] <Aoi> np :)
[14:39:25] <Omar-> i'm looking into your request btw, Aoi
[14:39:33] <Omar-> i'm just attacking on BoomBeach lol
[14:39:39] <Omar-> time to collect resources
[14:39:49] <Aoi> what's boombeach o.o?
[14:40:16] <Aoi> I am waiting on ArcheAge servers to be available again .. but since it might turn into a long night, I am also here (IRC is actually running on my server)
[14:40:59] <Omar-> Ajkthx wrap $('#demo').scrollbox(); in ready
[14:41:55] <Ajkthx> what?
[14:42:53] <Ajkthx> oh dear lord
[14:42:57] <Ajkthx> i think you're jesus
[14:43:00] <Ajkthx> can i pray to you?
[14:43:05] <Ajkthx> are you my savior?
[14:43:09] <Ajkthx> are you a wizard?

[16:25:28] <_BigWings_> anyone know how I would see which key is being pressed on chrome when using $(window).keypress callback, when a special key was also held down (ctrl alt or shift)
[16:25:57] <_BigWings_> on firefox the keycode doesn't change.. and the event argument also has a 'key' property which holds the actual key pressed
[16:26:33] <_BigWings_> chrome doesn't have the key property and the keycode is also not the same as when I don't hold a special key when i press a button
[16:26:51] <tasaif> http://www.epigroove.com/blog/check-for-modifier-keys-when-using-jquerys-keypress
[16:27:51] <_BigWings_> yes.. i know that.. but how do I know that 'z' was pressed when I pressed 'ctrl-z'
[16:28:45] <snover> because `which` is the keycode for z and and `ctrlKey` is true
[16:29:22] <_BigWings_> okay.. how do I get back to 'z' though
[16:29:46] <_BigWings_> is there a function to go from keycode to key?
[16:35:11] <_BigWings_> on firefox:  ctrl-z  -> e.which=122 e.key='z'      on chrome: ctrl-z -> e.which=26    e.key doesn't exist
[16:35:51] <_BigWings_> I'd like to add one event that fires on both chrome and firefox... so is there an automated way to convert one of these events into the other?

[16:38:25] <_BigWings_> it works in your example cuz the keycodes are the same on chrome and firefox
[16:38:42] <tasaif> cool
[16:39:04] <_BigWings_> I don't have the same keycodes.. but im not using coffeescript and Im on the 'keypress' event
[16:42:18] <_BigWings_> https://jsfiddle.net/6obq8047/1/
[16:42:37] <_BigWings_> thats giving me different codes on chrome and firefox
[16:42:44] <_BigWings_> when pressing ctrl-z
[16:42:52] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/xd2vhzqa/1/
[16:42:54] <tasaif> how about that?
[16:44:03] <_BigWings_> yes that works.. but you had to manually add the keycodes
[16:44:36] <tasaif> (shrug)
[16:45:05] <tasaif> are you looking for something like $('.blegh').on('undo') ?
[16:45:09] <_BigWings_> Id like to do something like    AddKeypressHandler({Key:"ctrl-z", Action:function(){myfunction()}})
[16:45:21] <_BigWings_> its not just undo.. thats just an example
[16:46:06] <_BigWings_> basically.. how do you add a keypress handler for ctrl, alt or shift presses in one go that works on both firefox and chrome
[16:46:44] <FFForever> Hey hey. How can I disable ajax form submission with jquery mobile (1.0)? the docs (http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.0/docs/forms/forms-sample.html) say to use data-ajax="false" but that's not working :\
[16:47:37] <ThePendulum> http://passon.memody.com/new <-- I have this tag input with a jQuery click event that should log some garbish into the console, but it doesn't seem to be firing. Any ideas?
[16:48:44] <tasaif> _BigWings_:  sounds like you want to write a jquery plugin
[16:48:51] <FFForever> Nevermind. I had a bad marge and ended up with two form tags.
[16:49:07] <m_zr0> _BigWings_:  i’ve used a method that detected like  if(shift.keypress && a.keypress) { stuff } )
[16:49:15] <m_zr0> kinda dirty, but it worked
[16:49:27] <tasaif> sounds like he wants a global solution
[16:49:33] <m_zr0> ah
[16:50:19] <_BigWings_> yes.. I can hardcode something for ctrl-z or whatever else but id rather not :)
[16:51:14] <_BigWings_> just knowing the math they use to go from keycode back to character pressed would be fine
[16:51:26] <tasaif> one moment
[16:51:30] <m_zr0> rofl my bad yeah i see there was a lot more to it than what i saw…scrolled up.  that sounds useful.
[16:53:40] <_BigWings_> hmm looks like chrome doesn't even get certain ctrl combinations at all... it fires on ctrl-z  but doesn't on ctrl-a for instance
[16:55:46] <ThePendulum> _BigWings_: what do you expect from ctrl-a that isn't happening?
[16:56:33] <_BigWings_> i expect it to fire the $(window).keypress event handler
[17:12:30] <tasaif> _BigWings_:  how's this?
[17:12:31] <tasaif> https://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/6obq8047/2/
[17:13:19] <tasaif> https://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/6obq8047/3/
[17:13:24] <tasaif> this one shows all options used
[17:13:24] <_BigWings_> how does it work? pressing ctrl-z doesn't do anything
[17:13:39] <tasaif> line 17
[17:13:49] <tasaif> you pass in the object that'll listen for the event
[17:13:51] <_BigWings_> btw I just found something online that will work as well
[17:13:54] <tasaif> next parameter are your options
[17:14:07] <tasaif> key, ctrl, alt, shift, and meta data
[17:14:15] <tasaif> last parameter is your handler
[17:14:51] <_BigWings_> http://www.gmarwaha.com/blog/2009/06/16/ctrl-key-combination-simple-jquery-plugin/
[17:14:57] <_BigWings_> cool
[17:15:04] <_BigWings_> lemmie check
[17:16:36] <_BigWings_> is it hooked up in the fiddle?
[17:16:41] <tasaif> yea
[17:16:43] <_BigWings_> it doesn't seem to do anything
[17:16:51] <tasaif> you need to select the text area
[17:16:59] <tasaif> that's what it's listening on
[17:17:25] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/uhnyyvd1/
[17:17:29] <_BigWings_> and then press ctrl-shift-a ?
[17:17:31] <tasaif> this is it in js
[17:17:34] <tasaif> yea
[17:18:19] <_BigWings_> doesn't seem to work for me on firefox
[17:18:21] <_BigWings_> :(
[17:18:22] <Dlabz> Hi all. How can I check if $ variable is jQuery, and not, in example, prototype.js?
[17:19:15] <_BigWings_> tasaif: but I got the online example to work though
[17:19:28] <tasaif> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ works for me on firefox
[17:19:37] <_BigWings_> http://www.gmarwaha.com/blog/2009/06/16/ctrl-key-combination-simple-jquery-plugin/
[17:19:44] <_BigWings_> that one...
[17:19:54] <_BigWings_> thanks a lot for the help :)
[17:20:02] <_BigWings_> appreciated
[17:20:14] <tasaif> np
[17:25:37] <scribblemaniac> Dlabz: try (typeof jQuery !== 'undefined' && $ === jQuery)
[17:26:36] <Dlabz> scribblemaniac: thanks
[17:28:53] <scribblemaniac> Dlabz: no problem
[17:30:45] <Dlabz> scribblemaniac: yup, this works. Thanks again
[17:38:07] <frabblerock> question. i want to be able to remove list items from my markup if a user clicks a checkbox, but then be able to add them back in when the user unclicks the checkbox - like completely remove the list item
[17:38:20] <frabblerock> is there a way to store removed items in an array, then add them back in?
[17:38:28] <frabblerock> where they originally were?
[17:45:15] <Guddu> I am generating a PDF on the Server and Launching a Modal to show that PDF in the same method that handles the Ajax Call and launches the modal. However, the modal shows up empty as the iframe was loaded during page load and PDF was not there at that time. WHat is he recommended way to go about this design?
[17:48:26] <scribblemaniac> Guddu: resetting the src should reload the iframe. The code would be something like this: $('#your_iframe').attr('src', $('#your_iframe').attr('src'));
[17:48:40] <Guddu> Thanks scribblemaniac
[17:53:35] <StanAccy> Im having some problems with event understanding. http://jsfiddle.net/6tzfyvjo/11/.
[17:54:55] <StanAccy> one sec, let me repaste
[17:57:32] <StanAccy> Ive got a scenario in a complex page where Im adding an event handler for a custom event, but after adding it, I cant see it in the Chrome inspector (and calls to trigger() dont trigger the event).
[17:58:05] <StanAccy> Ive create several jsfiddle's and they all work as expected, so its clearly something in the more complex page that I cant nail down
[17:58:22] <StanAccy> Just looking for suggestions on how to check whats registered on the element from an event standpoint
[17:58:34] <StanAccy> or what other things this sort of behavior could be caused by
[17:59:27] <lambdumb> what's the best way to execute an ajax call, load content, then reload every minute? right now my code looks like this http://pastebin.com/7ReX0avE
[17:59:51] <StanAccy> $.ajax() with a timer() on the success
[18:01:26] <lambdumb> i'm already using setInterval
[18:02:00] <Guddu> scribblemaniac, I tried that but same result. Could it be that the iframe is reloading itself very soon? Or even before the previous statement(server call) that generates the PDF completes?
[18:02:49] <Guddu> StanAccy, Could you please tell me more about this timer thing? May be it will help in my case.
[18:03:31] <Guddu> May be if i can cause a slight delay my problem will disappear?
[18:03:34] <StanAccy> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Code_snippets/Timers
[18:04:49] <lambdumb> StanAccy, i don't understand what you're implying
[18:05:34] <StanAccy> lambdumb: use $.ajax() and then set and interval timer in the ajax success function
[18:06:44] <lambdumb> http://pastebin.com/7ReX0avE like this?
[18:06:49] <scribblemaniac> Gudda: It's possible, perhaps a timer as you mentioned may help
[18:08:22] <scribblemaniac> Gudda: You said you were making some kind of ajax call. Do you have the code to show the modal and refresh the iframe in the callback function?
[18:10:25] <Guddu> scribblemaniac, The only thing I am doing post the ServerCall(that generates the PDF) is this
[18:10:36] <Guddu> $('#hr_pdf_iframe').attr('src',"/static_gdd_pdf/hr/LOAD_343015.pdf");
[18:10:49] <Guddu> Just setting the source. Nothing else. DO I need to call some reload etc?
[18:11:21] <Guddu> I tried using JQUery Modal instead of SemanticUI Modal and the .load() call loaded all Binary Garbage Text in the modal :-(
[18:11:22] <Guddu> Sigh
[18:11:54] <scribblemaniac> no you should need to do anything like that
[18:12:36] <Guddu> scribblemaniac, Does my code above look ok?
[18:14:27] <scribblemaniac> yeah, I don't know what could be going wrong unless your server is sending a response before the pdf generation is complete or your src is incorrect.
[18:18:53] <Guddu> scribblemaniac, Generally the code gets executed one line at a time is that right? So only when my method that generated the PDF via Ajax Call gets executed completely will it go to the next line where i launch the modal and iframe?
[18:28:41] <scribblemaniac> Guddu: Yes, normally that is the case, however it is different with ajax requests. You will have have to put your code in a function in the callback argument to guarantee that the request has complete.
[18:29:14] <Guddu> scribblemaniac, I do have a function callback for complete event though
[18:30:37] <Guddu> scribblemaniac, So that next line executes only after the complete callback  gets executed right?
[18:31:58] <scribblemaniac> Guddu, can you please upload a pastebin or a jsfiddle with what you are currently doing so I can say for sure whether or not the code is getting executed before the pdf generation is complete?
[18:34:43] <StanAccy> can I programatically see what event handlers are bound to an element?
[18:35:23] <Guddu> scribblemaniac, Please look at some relevant code here http://dpaste.com/27B8NSR
[18:35:48] <Guddu> I click in button with id visualize_hr and it has a click(function() asociated. That's where this starts.
[18:39:24] <scribblemaniac> have you tried putting your modal and attr statements inside the if (textStatus == "success")?
[18:39:25] <Guddu> scribblemaniac, I will also do some console.log statements to review the order of calls
[18:39:35] <Guddu> scribblemaniac, Will try now
[18:40:29] <Guddu> scribblemaniac, You are a Star
[18:40:43] <Guddu> :-)
[18:40:54] <scribblemaniac> Guddu: I'm guessing it worked :)
[18:40:58] <Guddu> Yes
[18:41:19] <Guddu> SO all this while I was living in oblivion. I always thought that code will execute in the same order in which it is coded.
[18:41:27] <Guddu> Thank you so much scribblemaniac
[18:41:53] <scribblemaniac> Guddu: no problem, glad I could help
[19:08:22] <StanAccy> If I create an element in jQuery, using $element = $('<div></div>'); and then append that to say, $('body'), is $element the "real" element in the DOM or is it just a temporary copy?
[19:23:40] <lambdumb> if i define and use a variable in plain javascript can i use it in jquery on the same page?
[19:37:10] <gWorldz> lets say I'm trying to get ui tabs working in wordpress admin but can't get it to work is this teh plac eto ask?
[19:49:17] <cavallari> Hi people... is there any way to wrap more than one element into a single div?
[20:10:27] <Trent> Can someone please be my hero? IE8 "unexpected call to method or property access" jQuery-1.11.2.js:5756 (append/appendChild)
[20:12:00] <Trent> Been struggling with this error for days... What sort of append() operation in IE8 might possibly cause that error?
[20:22:03] <huck5> ry
[20:22:36] <huck5> Woops. Hey! I need to select an <a href> tag, that holds a specific link. How can I do this?
[20:23:24] <huck5> I know that I can selectively replace all divs/tags with a specific ID or Class. How can I selectively choose an href by it's link-contents? For example: <a href="user/2"> <a href="user/3">. I only want to select The "user/2" ?
[20:27:32] <microhaxo> json parse not enough storage to complete on Ajax result of about 3mb??
[20:29:24] <kevireilly>  huck5: never tried it so I'm not sure it works, but in theory something like $('a[href=user/2])
[20:29:40] <kevireilly> err $('a[href=user/2')
[20:30:41] <kevireilly> $('a').find('[href=user/2]') may be more performant, or even $('a').each(...) and evaluate $(this).attr('href')
[20:31:30] <kevireilly> oh, and for the second part of your question, it would then be .attr('href') to get the href contents
[20:39:31] <huck5> kevireilly, That makes sense. I guess I wasn't specific enough; I don't know the link before-hand. It is specific to each user.
[20:40:01] <huck5> I.e. I need to access a User variable, to append its ID to the end of the anchor link. I'm working on an alternative solution now, though. But thank you nonetheless :)
[20:47:49] <kevireilly> huck5: same thing applies, just replace your variables in the selector string
[20:56:27] <huck5> kevireilly: Excellent! Your assistance is greatly appreciated. I'm hoping that my alternative solution will work; otherwise I'll be back ;)
[21:29:45] <huck5> Hi!
[21:30:01] <huck5> How can I refresh an entire page with jquery?
[21:30:14] <LiENUS> huck5, sure why not
[21:30:21] <LiENUS> you could do it without jquery too
[21:31:05] <huck5> LiENUS, I say "with jquery", because I am activating a .js script with Ruby on Rails. I need the script to refresh an entire page (as refreshing a specific div is not meeting my requirements)
[21:31:36] <LiENUS> i feel like refreshing a page isnt actually what you want
[21:31:42] <huck5> It isn't :D
[21:31:43] <LiENUS> but location.reload(); refreshes the pge
[21:32:29] <LiENUS> i feel like you probably want to load data into the page via ajax
[21:32:31] <huck5> Perfect :). That's somewhere to start at least.
[21:32:34] <huck5> I do!
[21:32:38] <huck5> I just have no idea how...
[21:32:44] <LiENUS> something like $('body').innerHtml is the place to start
[21:32:56] <huck5> 'body'; did not think of that.
[21:33:16] <huck5> I tried putting a 'form' into a partial; and re-rendering that, but it didn't update how I expected.
[21:33:23] <scribblemaniac> huck5: wow thanks for asking this question, I would've also suggested location.reload() by by searching I found a few alternateves: http://www.phpied.com/files/location-location/location-location.html
[21:33:23] <LiENUS> i usually make a content div though
[21:33:29] <LiENUS> so im not having to reload all of the menu
[21:34:15] <huck5> yeah, that makes good sense.
[21:34:54] <huck5> The outcome is intended to be an asynchronous update on an index-page that displays the information for a bunch of users. When a user 'submits' their edits, it should be reflected on all open-browsers.
[21:36:21] <huck5> anyways. I'll try refreshing the entire page.Ty!
