[00:01:03] <luvmyh0nda> i can get the raw image when i use the first ajax() call
[00:01:17] <luvmyh0nda> i need to move that source over to a remote server
[00:01:30] <luvmyh0nda> and save as a new image
[00:01:32] <ravenzz> ..
[00:01:49] <ravenzz> that's meant to be used into the browser
[00:01:58] <luvmyh0nda> attached to a client's file
[00:02:01] <luvmyh0nda> and viewed at a later date
[00:02:04] <ravenzz> again, its lifetime is tied to the document in the window on which it was created
[00:02:34] <ravenzz> if you want to upload an img there are many other ways to do that
[00:04:50] <luvmyh0nda> other than using a file selection
[00:06:52] <ravenzz> luvmyh0nda well where do you get the images from now?
[00:06:53] <ravenzz> server?

[00:14:06] <motaka2> 	hello can anyone check to see if this website is working key2persia.com
[00:15:18] <matchs> motaka2, it's taking too long to respond here
[00:15:47] <matchs> timeout actually
[00:16:35] <motaka2> matchs: What should I do ?
[00:16:41] <motaka2> It was working
[00:16:49] <motaka2> it is a host from webintellects
[00:16:55] <matchs> humm
[00:17:02] <matchs> idk... what happened?
[00:17:02] <motaka2> I cant even login into WHM to restart apache
[00:17:13] <luvmyh0nda> no response to ping
[00:17:31] <luvmyh0nda> a) the server is down b) the host's internet connectivity is down
[00:18:43] <motaka2> luvmyh0nda: how can I some other hosts on webintellects to see if the experience the same problem
[00:18:45] <motaka2> ?

[00:23:32] <okdamn> hey why my ajax method runs error statment also when it is successfull?
[00:23:49] <okdamn> i logged the error statment in console but wtf there is nothing
[00:23:50] <okdamn> readyState
[00:23:51] <okdamn> 4
[00:23:51] <okdamn> responseText
[00:23:51] <okdamn> "\nsuccess"
[00:23:52] <okdamn> status
[00:23:52] <okdamn> 200
[00:23:53] <okdamn> statusText
[00:23:54] <okdamn> "OK"
[00:24:12] <okdamn> seems all ok so why it runs the error:function(err){ console.log(err); }
[00:24:18] <okdamn> ? :(
[00:24:33] <matchs> okdamn, can u show us some code?
[00:24:54] <okdamn> yeah sure
[00:25:32] <okdamn> http://pastebin.com/N4NDGeYB
[00:25:45] <okdamn> when the ajax successfull it prints back a string
[00:25:54] <okdamn> and it is successfull and i see the string in body response
[00:25:59] <okdamn> once the request is finished
[00:26:07] <okdamn> i mean all works, but ajax shows error anyway :/
[00:26:46] <okdamn> i guessed it was a ajax dataType: issue
[00:26:51] <okdamn> so i tryed both json and script
[00:26:57] <okdamn> but it's the same soooo strange :D
[00:27:42] <matchs> okdamn, what are the responses from your server, and how are verifying it?
[00:27:53] <matchs> *how are you veryfing it?
[00:28:09] <okdamn> matchs:  i don't verify them, i mean, script is launched and script returns a string in response
[00:28:18] <okdamn> and request gets 200k without any problem
[00:28:32] <okdamn> but the error: runs too wtff :D
[00:30:28] <okdamn> oh oh matchs now i putted return true; at the end of the php script
[00:30:35] <okdamn> and it doesn't shows more the error
[00:30:48] <okdamn> probably i need a return instead of an echo
[00:30:51] <okdamn> right?
[00:31:02] <matchs> I don't think so
[00:31:15] <okdamn> oh good :D
[00:31:21] <okdamn> what you guess? :P
[00:31:24] <matchs> how are you doing your server responses, can you show me?
[00:32:21] <okdamn> response is  return true;
[00:32:29] <okdamn> and it returns 200 OK
[00:32:41] <matchs> and the response body?
[00:32:44] <okdamn> but now with the return true; instead of the echo 'success'; it WORKS
[00:33:00] <okdamn> i fixed i mean using return true; at the end of the php script
[00:34:11] <matchs> hehehehehe... okay then, I was trying to figure out what was the problem, but nevermind =D
[00:36:26] <matchs> well... have a good night everybody! (it's night here... and it's late already)... gotta get some sleep...
[00:37:31] <motaka2> okdamn: What should I do now?
[00:39:46] <okdamn> motaka2:  uh? nothing dude :D
[00:40:05] <okdamn> matchs:  well if you courious we can check it, i'm courious
[00:40:28] <okdamn> it's strange, probably dataType:'script' wants a server response and not a body response
[00:40:30] <okdamn> dunno :P
[00:43:15] <matchs> okdamn, Yes I'm curious. But it's almost 5am here and I didn't sleep yet, hehehehe, so, once you've already solved your problem, I'm going to let that pass for now. When we meet again I'm certainly going to ask you if you figured out why it wasn't working. Nice to meet you dude.
[00:43:29] <okdamn> oh lol np
[00:43:37] <okdamn> nice for met too buddy
[01:52:26] <okdamn> hey why this won't work ? http://pastebin.com/EyzJYC0F

[03:16:37] <chrisftw> hello
[03:16:43] <chrisftw> I have a simple question I think
[03:16:50] <temporary> Hello, I can't for the life of me get the following line to work (I want to remove a jquery-created li when it's clicked). I'm new to jquery so would appreciate any advice? Thanks :)
[03:16:54] <temporary> $("li").live("click", function() { $(this).remove();});
[03:17:18] <chrisftw> if I am using I have a question too
[03:17:36] <temporary> Sorry chrisftw, jumped in half way through your question ;)
[03:17:44] <chrisftw> hahah thats ok
[03:17:53] <chrisftw> ill ask later
[03:17:54] <chrisftw> = )
[03:18:28] <temporary> haha, go ahead - there's no queue!
[03:24:31] <iwastemporary> ah, I was being an idiot - somehow managed to miss the fact that .live() is deprecated...
[03:43:16] <jop008> Any hep on this form fill issue try to fill a textarea field. The ajax call to the DB is okay I have a filled record in variable field http://pastebin.com/ZpfMQ7uF
[03:47:58] <spobat> how can I make this faster:
[03:48:09] <spobat> $('#a-list').find('li:contains("'+name+'")').children('.unseen');
[03:51:00] <jop008> the id summary is causing my problems
[03:57:26] <ravenzz> spot using filter()
[03:57:32] <ravenzz> http://jsperf.com/jquery-contain-vs-filter
[03:58:09] <ravenzz> actually this could be done in vanilla js which would be even faster
[03:59:44] <jedimind> YOU could be done in vanilla js
[04:03:31] <ravenzz> spot there you go http://jsperf.com/jquery-contain-vs-filter
[04:04:07] * ravenzz slaps jedimind around a bit with a large trout
[04:05:26] <jop008> http://pastebin.com/M3GBC361 any clue on this?
[04:05:48] <jop008> It is about parsing a form
[04:07:56] <ravenzz> elements?
[04:08:02] <jop008> Yep
[04:08:05] <RabSimpson> hi folks. how would i set vars as global in jquery? i've got a few functions set to run on certain events and most of them use common variables, but in order for them to actually work i've had to declare them multiple times and inside the functions. any ideas?
[04:08:30] <jop008> sometimes it is okay but with two tetarea fields there is a problem
[04:09:06] <ravenzz> can you try to reproduce your issue on jsfiddle or jsbin?
[04:09:30] <jop008> neve done that
[04:10:02] <jop008> and it is very difficult to do it is part of a framework
[04:14:46] <boytoy> Hi, I'm trying to split this list into two columns (without actually putting it in two columns) http://jsbin.com/edisoz/1/edit -- is there an easier way to do this though?
[04:14:48] <jop008> when I chec fields <forn id="rental_object">
[04:14:56] <jop008> <forn id="rental_object"></form>
[04:15:08] <jop008> so it looks like my form doesn't have fields
[04:19:39] <jop008> I have this fields        = document.getElementById(cform); and then I try to use fields.elements
[04:19:55] <jop008> but that is not possible fields is filled
[04:24:30] <boytoy> jop008: i dont think ur gonna get much help unless u produce a jsbin or something man
[04:25:35] <jop008> I have this document.getElementById("rental_object").length but length is not defined
[04:25:59] <jop008> so my form is found but it has no property length
[04:28:49] <lilleman> Hello! I got this: $('form').bind('submit', function(e){ ... How can I find out, within this function, what button was pressed?
[04:33:20] <jop008> So I have this var x=document.getElementById("rental_object"); x is filled in but x.length is not possible

[06:08:25] <dpiwowarski> Hi

[08:20:24] <Danic> Hi there! Is there a way to use jQueryUI widget and remove the styles from it? I don't want to override every single style attached to it, instead just define my own three definitions.
[08:22:11] <geekbuntu> Danic: do you have a link -> try something in firebug?
[08:23:30] <Danic> Pretty basic actually. http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ If you type "ja" you see that the dropdown is styled and also the links are styled when hovered on.
[08:23:54] <Danic> I want all that functionality but without styles attached to it.
[08:24:07] <Danic> of course the classes should remain so I can style them myself.
[08:24:34] <geekbuntu> don't include the jquery-ui.css?
[08:24:56] <geekbuntu> and grep through the method in the plugin - just change classes to suit your site css?
[08:25:24] * Danic blusehs
[08:25:28] <Danic> oh man
[08:25:42] <Danic> i thought .. well, doesnt matter. thx
[08:25:50] <geekbuntu> it's all good
[08:25:56] <Danic> ^^
[08:29:07] <jop008> How can you display images correctly sometimes it is portrait and sometimes landscape
[08:33:53] <shoky> "correctly" ?
[08:34:19] <shoky> you prolly want a max-width or max-height
[08:35:38] <jop008> how can you display a picture in portrait using jqM?
[08:36:00] <shoky> ugh
[08:46:52] <Ortund> so this is hiding all the list items that aren't in the selected category, but I also want it to filter each category interchangably, but I can't figure out the .show part... any suggestions?
[08:46:58] <Ortund> err... link coming
[08:48:18] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/RjuEx/
[08:55:41] <xec> jop008: your question doesn't make sense
[08:55:51] <Ortund> oh I thought you were talking to me lol
[09:01:40] <jop008> why doesn't make it no sense?
[09:01:58] <jop008> when i view my page on the ipad the image is rendered fine in portrait
[09:02:06] <jop008> in chrome desktop it is landscape
[09:02:21] <jop008> so I want chrome also in portrait
[09:02:35] <jop008> there must be some way
[09:05:50] <okdamn> hi all

[09:10:04] <okdamn> any clue dudes? how can i dinamically change the iframe height binding event on a iframe's element?
[09:13:49] <okdamn> dudes........
[09:16:51] <shoky> okdamn: if it's on the same domain/origin, you can
[09:18:50] <andresdavia> One question.. im new to ajax and im wondering if its possible to download a file using ajax?
[09:20:29] <Ortund> why not just hyperlink to the item?
[09:20:58] <okdamn> shoky:  it's on same domain sure
[09:21:11] <okdamn> but how to change his size dinamically from inside it?
[09:21:33] <andresdavia> ?
[09:21:33] <okdamn> just calling iframe id from inside the iframe?
[09:21:45] <shoky> okdamn: you can get the parent window with "parent"
[09:22:00] <okdamn> shoky:  have you little example pls?
[09:22:07] <okdamn> you mean window.parent ?
[09:23:39] <shoky> okdamn: yes, same thing.

[09:25:58] <jop008> how can I influence the device portrait mode for my desktop browser my image is rotated in landscape mode but it is a portrait photo http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-07-20_at_6.24.39_PM-WYhFragC.png
[09:26:25] <jop008> on the ipad it is in portrait not depending on the ipad portrait or landscape mode
[09:29:27] <jop008> I use <img src= widh=> as HTML tag
[09:38:12] <Ortund> can anyone help me figure out what's happening with the toggles here? http://loganyoung.za.net/new/software/
[10:06:48] <defk0n> im think im going crazy, how do you work on html snippets in jquery?
[10:07:15] <defk0n> var resp = request.responseText;
[10:07:15] <defk0n> 		$('#mydocumentelement').html(resp).find('td').each(function(i){
[10:07:28] <defk0n> ?
[10:09:48] <defk0n> especially malformed html. i got this string of nasty looking html and im trying to parse it
[10:10:20] <defk0n> on node js/cheerio it works (not in jsdom, which emulates the dom sort off), but in jquery it doesnt. does jquery build the dom?
[10:10:30] <defk0n> is it possible to just let it search for tags?
[10:11:52] <eddiemonge> why dont you make it well-formed?
[10:12:10] <HarryPitfall> not all browser deals with malformed html nicely...
[10:12:30] <HarryPitfall> IE for example hate when you use .html() with something bad...
[10:12:35] <defk0n> i cant make it welformed, seeing its from a 3rd party site
[10:14:32] <Ortund> can anyone help me with my toggles here? they're working (more or less) except they're toggling 1 too many times I think... basically, I just want it to show/hide articles by the selected category http://loganyoung.za.net/new/software/#
[10:19:14] <defk0n> ortuned that looks pretty fun
[10:19:26] <defk0n> iwoudl leave it as is
[10:19:29] <defk0n> :P
[10:21:10] <Ortund> I don't think so...
[10:21:30] <Ortund> for one thing, every click ends the user up with an empty list
[10:21:48] <Ortund> not sure what's going wrong with it...
[10:24:09] <Ortund> I was going to use the show/hide functions, but I couldn't figure out what to to check to determine whether an item is visible or not
[10:26:05] <defk0n> you should post your specific jquery code though. people are not going to debug your whole sit
[10:31:18] <Ortund> no worries now... I thought outside the box for a second and tackled it from a different angle, works like a charm now :)
[10:36:32] <Ortund> just got an issue now with fixing the height of the container div...
[11:23:29] <windozer> Hello. I'm having an issue using the nextAll() method and select items.
[11:23:55] <windozer> For some reason, when I just <p> tags around my form items, nextAll() doesn't detect the items in the class I mentioned.
[11:23:59] <windozer> But when I remove them, it works fine.
[11:24:11] <windozer> Is there any way I have have it search outside of the scope of the <p>?
[11:29:21] <RabSimpson> hi folks. i'm having trouble with the height of an element when the orientation of my device changes and there isn't much content within it. here's the link: http://www.robertsimpson.co.uk/static/new.htm any ideas?
[12:24:35] <pl2> Can one of you fine fellows remind me how to restore 'this' reference back to my calling object from within a callback?
[12:25:54] <alexr2> pl2, you need to bind it into the function.  Not quite sure on how jQuery does it (i'm pretty sure it can), but I know that underscore.js or lodash.js has a _.bind function
[12:26:46] <pl2> hmm, i'll check that out. thanks!
[12:27:34] <alexr2> With those libraries you would just do something like _.bind(function() {}, this)
[12:47:42] <jugglinmike> pl2: Check out $.proxy for equivalent functionality in jQuery http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[12:48:02] <alexr2> knew there was some way to do it with jquery
[12:48:07] <jugglinmike> alexr2: ^
[12:48:16] <jugglinmike> ah, yes
[12:49:34] <pl2> Yes, that was the function I remember using a while back ;)
[12:50:06] <pl2> In my case, just now, i was able to get by with: var self = this; thanks again
[13:35:06] <tw2113> anyone in here ever created a list of logged in users via js/ajax alone?
[13:35:41] <tw2113> trying to come up with a way to create a list of logged in users to display to everyone
[13:38:17] <ko2in1> tw2113: display online users ?
[13:38:33] <tw2113> yeah
[13:39:38] <ko2in1> tw2113: you can mark the currently logged in users in the database when they logged in ..
[13:40:00] <ko2in1> tw2113: for example, logged_in: 1
[13:40:07] <tw2113> yeah
[13:40:24] <tw2113> but then i need to find a way to track when they leave the page i want to track them on
[13:40:57] <tw2113> and there's no guarantee they'll click a "log out" button
[13:41:04] <tw2113> they could just navigate away from the page
[13:42:04] <ko2in1> tw2113: you can use some js to invoke functions with onunload event to logged out these users ..
[13:42:14] <tw2113> hmm
[13:52:37] <uknownalgorithms> How can i add an if statement to my code to check if the parent div has a class and remove it if it does, add it if it doesn't. I have a simple toggle script http://jsfiddle.net/timur/bMfdD/5/
[13:53:06] <edoop> do you suggest me an easy  bottom gallery ?
[13:54:03] <shoky> uknownalgorithms: $(this).parent().toggleClass('tehClass')
[13:55:40] <uknownalgorithms> sweet thanks shoky
[14:01:37] <PhlowHome> I have a page that is using bootstrap modal to open a remote page.  That remote page has some google analytics code in it that is doing a document.write of a script element.  This is clearly bad news, is there any quick/dirty workaround for this?
[14:05:20] <tw2113> sup shoky ?
[14:06:41] <RandalSchwartz> I wonder why the "aria-controls" of jquery ui tabs isn't documented
[14:06:52] <RandalSchwartz> it's pretty slick... lets you have bookmarkable tabs
[14:07:18] <shoky> pretty spaced, tw2113. sups
[14:07:44] <tw2113> looking at bleeding edge WP features to help with this chatroom thing i'm mulling over
[14:08:31] <shoky> what chatroom thing
[14:08:52] <tw2113> a plugin from the company i work for. I'm trying to find a way to create a "current logged in users" list
[14:09:10] <tw2113> and keep it dynamic
[14:12:20] <shoky> haven't done it myself.. could think of several ways to go, prolly some combo is best. adunno
[14:12:38] <tw2113> my notes have a few ajax calls
[14:13:09] <tw2113> a post call once a user goes to the right place, updates a field in the db
[14:13:22] <tw2113> a timer + ajax get to fetch all users with that field set
[14:13:38] <tw2113> and then ajax post in onunload to remove that value once they leave
[14:14:45] <shoky> that'd work. need a session timeout or some kind of timeout too
[14:15:37] <shoky> can't be sure you'll get the chance to send the logout ajax
[14:15:56] <tw2113> noted down
[14:16:12] <tw2113> the fun i get to do when coding features for a "Pro" plugin
[14:16:39] <shoky> doesn't sound too bad
[14:17:24] <tw2113> nah, a nice challenge for me to get a headache over :D
[14:17:26] <tw2113> gotta go
[14:17:38] <shoky> ta~
[14:43:13] <dh5> Any chance someone can point out to me why I can't embed a small js into an html document? My js skills are non-existent atm.
[14:43:42] <dh5> Well, I can embed it, the script just doesn't work
[14:44:05] <pixelpimp> pastebin the code somewhere
[14:44:38] <dh5> http://pastebin.com/L50zZGt5
[14:45:20] <dh5> I'm sure it has something to do with the syntax, I'm just not far enough in js to figure it out
[14:45:54] <pixelpimp> I'm not familiar with twitch, but nothing seems out of place there
[14:46:03] <pixelpimp> what's your html look like?
[14:46:22] <dh5> Let me give you this link
[14:46:23] <dh5> http://codepen.io/svinkle/pen/qIyAE
[14:46:32] <dh5> That's where the code was originally found
[14:46:48] <dh5> it seems to work perfectly fine within codepen, but whenever I take it outside, it's just not doing it
[14:47:32] <pixelpimp> Doesn't look like that <iframe> has an id like it should though
[14:47:44] <pixelpimp> in your code, does it have id="twitch-widget"?
[14:47:56] <pixelpimp> oh wait, that's the <a> at the top
[14:48:04] <dh5> Yeah, its the one at the top
[14:48:46] <dh5> My code does, I basically dumped everything from that link into a small test HTML doc
[14:49:00] <pixelpimp> yeah, i see nothing wrong here either... seems to work just fine
[14:49:13] <pixelpimp> have it up live somewhere not working?
[14:49:43] <dh5> localhosting it
[14:49:45] <dh5> one sec
[14:50:53] <pixelpimp> could be that it's getting called too early -- maybe put it inside a $(document).read() call?
[14:51:01] <pixelpimp> err, .ready()
[14:51:57] <pixelpimp> $(document).ready(function() { /* put your code here */ });
[14:52:28] <dh5> Let me give that a try
[14:52:35] <dh5> Here is a pastebin of the file I have in localhost
[14:52:46] <dh5> it's basically just a dump of codepen into an html doc
[14:52:48] <dh5> http://pastebin.com/P2UhkKup
[14:54:06] <pixelpimp> yeah, try the $(document).ready() thing
[14:54:29] <pixelpimp> pretty sure it's just trying to change stuff that doesn't exist yet
[14:55:28] <dh5> hmmm, nothing
[14:55:36] <dh5> this is frustrating
[14:56:33] <dh5> ha
[14:56:36] <dh5> now it worked
[14:56:51] <dh5> made a typo spelling document :|
[14:57:16] <pixelpimp> :D
[14:57:33] <dh5> Thanks a bunch! :)
[14:57:57] <pixelpimp> yep, no problem
[14:59:42] <TitoN> hi i'm having problem getting objects to hide when i check a radiobutton.... anyone able to help?
[15:01:36] <pixelpimp> have code up somewhere?
[15:01:54] <TitoN> k 2 sek
[15:03:15] <pixelpimp> 2 swedish kronor
[15:04:34] <dannydagger> 2 swedish sekunder
[15:05:39] <TitoN> http://jsfiddle.net/C8HW6/
[15:05:44] <pixelpimp> 2 swedish kronor/2 swedish sekunder?  seems like a good deal
[15:05:47] <TitoN> hehe yes 2 sekunder
[15:06:12] <dannydagger> haha
[15:10:26] <TitoN> i just wont run :/
[15:10:27] <pixelpimp> you probably want to test on $(this) rather than $('input[name=customer]:checked')
[15:12:31] <TitoN> didnt work
[15:16:30] <TitoN> it doesnt even hide the div with the first line of setting css
[15:17:34] <pixelpimp> what's your div look like?
[15:17:56] <TitoN> i just added a div to the jsfiddle to test
[15:18:27] <TitoN> i want to show some fields in a registration form if the customer is a company
[15:19:52] <TitoN> so basic but i starred at this to long now i cant seem to get ti to work
[15:20:22] <TitoN> it should atleast hide the div when it finished loading
[15:21:29] <pixelpimp> http://jsfiddle.net/C8HW6/8/
[15:21:40] <pixelpimp> i think that's what you meant to do?
[15:22:14] <TitoN> exactly but where did i go wrong hmmm
[15:22:16] <TitoN> thx alot buddy
[15:22:21] <pixelpimp> a couple areas
[15:22:37] <TitoN> u added the source
[15:22:58] <pixelpimp> i think it's needed... didn't seem like jsfiddle lets you use jquery
[15:23:27] <TitoN> ahhh i see
[15:23:42] <pixelpimp> anyway, here's where you really went wrong:  first off, you check if they're clicking id="private", so the value will never be "company"
[15:24:22] <pixelpimp> then you test on all matches to 'input[name=customer]:checked' when you really only need to be checking the currently clicked item ($(this))
[15:24:56] <pixelpimp> then i just changed your .css('display', 'none') to a .hide() and added an else{} to hide it again
[15:25:12] <TitoN> $("#private").click(function(){           wouldnt this check if that is clicked
[15:25:22] <pixelpimp> only the private one, not the company one
[15:25:35] <TitoN> ahhh doh i never checked what i wanted LOL
[15:25:54] <TitoN> i feel stupid as i should
[15:26:26] <TitoN> hehe thx again and especially for pointing it out for me really appreciated
[15:31:09] <pixelpimp> TitoN: personally, this is how i'd do it: http://jsfiddle.net/C8HW6/9/
[15:31:19] <pixelpimp> an entirely different approach though, much simpler i think
[15:32:04] <TitoN> yea there u check which button is clicked and then change the status of div based on that
[15:32:17] <pixelpimp> yeah
[15:33:34] <TitoN> yea it works better. got more divs needed to change whether its privat or a company
[15:36:35] <TitoN> works spot on :-)
[15:49:20] <TitoN> hmmm it killed some other scripts running tho
[15:50:24] <defk0n> how to get form name after being submitted.
[15:50:30] <defk0n>  $('form').submit(function(e){
[15:50:30] <defk0n>     	e.preventDefault();
[15:50:30] <defk0n>     	var name = this.name;
[15:50:44] <defk0n> this is not working. unsuprisingly…….. >:(
[15:52:39] <shoky> defk0n: that should work. assuming the form actually has a name
[15:53:22] <defk0n> yea it has a name
[15:53:36] <shoky> works for me
[15:57:06] <defk0n> yea not working for me
[15:57:22] <shoky> jsfiddle it
[15:57:26] <defk0n> 2.03
[15:58:08] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/zZQua/1/
[15:58:12] <TitoN> $.noConflict(); fixed it
[16:00:39] <defk0n> i have 2 forms if that helps
[16:00:46] <defk0n> idont know why its not working for me
[16:00:51] <shoky> a jsfiddle would help
[16:05:36] <defk0n> fixed it, angularjs was interfering i suppose
[16:07:43] <dannydagger> can someone help me figure out the jQuery used on this site for the video? if i want to make a initial page like that, how can i use that jQuery for an image instead of a video? www.exponentpr.com
[16:08:29] <defk0n> but now it only submits one form, even if the other form is the one being submitted.
[16:08:30] <defk0n> http://jsfiddle.net/QAqtW/
[16:08:32] <defk0n> ug
[16:08:34] <defk0n> ugh
[16:08:49] <pixelpimp> just... put an image there instead?
[16:09:15] <shoky> defk0n:  if (name = "zip")  ...
[16:09:49] <defk0n> what do you mean?
[16:10:07] <shoky> that's bad..
[16:10:21] <defk0n> oh yea
[16:10:24] <defk0n> ===
[16:10:31] <shoky> if you please.
[16:10:51] <defk0n> still not working thou
[16:11:24] <RandalSchwartz> ok - got middleware working... now to build the webapp with Dart
[16:11:57] <shoky> defk0n:  you didn't properly close the first form
[16:12:07] <shoky> defk0n: nor the second.. ;]
[16:12:56] <defk0n> hehe
[16:13:03] <defk0n> ^_^"
[16:13:10] <defk0n> jquery is stressing me out. sry
[16:13:22] <shoky> no worries
[16:13:22] <defk0n> its working noa
[16:17:45] <aaairc> Does anyone know why this jQuery ajax request to the youtube data api isn't working? it was working a few months ago, and i just picked back up the code and it no longer works.
[16:17:54] <aaairc> you can see an example of the request here: http://jsfiddle.net/24v2b/
[16:17:56] <RandalSchwartz> oops... wrong channel
[16:19:01] <tw2113> aaairc, it's returning an object, you just don't do anything with it
[16:19:47] <aaairc> tw2113: its never getting into the .done() statement it seems like to me
[16:20:08] <aaairc> it creates the request, but the $.when().done() doesn't seem to work
[16:20:53] <tw2113> i see "done" in console and then "[object Object]" right after it
[16:21:13] <tw2113> which i figure is the youtube_response variable
[16:21:36] <dannydagger> pixelpimp: I think there is something in the jQuery preventing that from being responsive
[16:22:31] <dannydagger> because there is alot of video functions in there
[16:23:04] <aaairc> tw2113: what browser are you using? for some reason for me in Chrome Version 28.0.1500.71 for Mac its not printing out that "done" in my console.
[16:23:08] <tw2113> console.log(youtube_response.feed.title.$t); results in "Videos matching: bob dylan"
[16:23:15] <tw2113> firefox aurora
[16:24:09] <dannydagger> pixelpimp: I am just trying to logically understand how to simplify the jQuery to work for just an image and remove the video part alltogether
[16:24:37] <shoky> aaairc: working for me too, in chrome on windows
[16:24:47] <tw2113> aaairc, http://d.pr/i/UZ0M
[16:25:01] <tw2113> just tested in chrome stable on osx as well
[16:25:22] <tw2113> same version
[16:25:41] <pixelpimp> dannydagger: what jquery are you talking about?
[16:28:43] <dannydagger> pixelpimp: when you view the site on 1920p, the background video extends between the logo section and the navbar.. making the content below the navbar still invisible unless you scroll down first
[16:31:52] <aaairc> tw2113: hmm. it works for me in Safari and Firefox, but for some reason not working for me in Chrome OSX
[16:32:08] <pixelpimp> oh.. well i don't have a monitor even big enough to test that
[16:32:10] <tw2113> no idea
[16:32:38] <sammich> so, you can store arbitrary data in an element? when did this happen
[16:32:39] <sammich> ?
[16:32:48] <xboi209> how do i replace an element with a img from another element?
[16:32:48] <sammich> not using jQuery, that is
[16:32:55] <dannydagger> pixelpimp: if you minimize the window vertically you will see that the element height is automated
[16:33:50] <xboi209> how do i replace an element with a img from the same element?*
[16:33:54] <aaairc> tw2113: k thx. i'm hoping its just a quirk of my browser version then. what version of the Mac OS do you have? also what hardware when you test Chrome OSX?
[16:34:20] <tw2113> i have the late 2011 MBA and lion
[16:34:26] <tw2113> never bothered with mountain lion yet
[16:34:37] <tw2113> one would think those parts wouldn't matter with a console.log in chrome of the same version
[16:37:56] <aaairc> tw2113: k
[16:38:04] <aaairc> tw2113: thanks for testing
[16:39:42] <dannydagger> pixelpimp: i hoped there would be an easier way to do this responsive image thing in that div.. but it seems jQuery is the only way to go as far as i know
[17:14:55] <veQue> hi according to the top answer here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3352020/jquery-the-best-way-to-set-a-global-variable  "If you have to generate global variables in production code (which should be avoided) always declare them explicitly:". Is he right that global variables should be avoided? or is that his opinion?
[17:15:53] <systemfault> Of course global variables should be avoided..
[17:16:07] <systemfault> With JS though.. it's difficult to not have at least one.
[17:17:08] <veQue> hmm ok.
[17:17:31] <systemfault> They make code difficult to test...
[17:17:48] <systemfault> They lead to unnecessary coupling..
[17:18:03] <systemfault> Makes the code more difficult to understand.
[17:18:47] <veQue> It's really hard for me to see a way to avoid this. I have some functions and they both need at times access to the same variable
[17:19:02] <veQue> why wouldn't global be the solution?
[17:19:09] <veQue> what would be the solution too?
[17:19:37] <systemfault> You pass the parameters you need.
[17:20:00] <veQue> hmmm
[17:20:14] <systemfault> veQue: Do you have a specific case?
[17:20:37] <veQue> so instead of writing a function that takes no arguments make a function that takes some
[17:21:14] <systemfault> It really depends on the case.
[17:21:41] * veQue thinks
[17:21:55] <systemfault> In some specific cases, even though they should be avoided, a global variable _could_be_ the best approach to a problem.
[17:22:55] <veQue> understood
[17:28:55] <veQue> I fear I do not have the brain power to figure the proper way. I guess i going with the way that works for my current intelligence level.
[17:29:19] <veQue> I know it's a cop out. but I'll learn the better way later.
[18:44:14] <beshoo> i have a problem with jq : i have sthis style : #my-element{width:60%;} , now when i want to get the width by pixel : $('#my-element').outerWidth(true) it return "60"
[18:44:53] <beshoo> but the #my-element Width after rendering is over 590px
[18:45:57] <beshoo> why
[19:02:40] <jangoh> http://bootply.com/68820 Nested submenus are overlapping how do i fix
[20:53:43] <andrewSC> How would one recreate the transition that occurs when you hover over Werk, or Contact? http://www.blocklevel.nl/
[20:53:53] <andrewSC> seems like tween
[20:53:56] <andrewSC> but idk
[22:13:20] <xboi209> is it possible to have multiple :contains() inside a .filter()?
[22:13:39] <xboi209> or a :contains() with comparisons
[22:14:12] <xboi209> forget the last line i said
[23:01:56] <nesoi> is there a lazy loader that works with JQM which will load in reverse (ie: from the top rather than the bottom)?
[23:42:23] <erdos> hey yall
[23:44:12] <rakl> I have a map of the US with states that you can click on. Users can select multiple states and each new combination will fire an ajax call. Is there a standard way of waiting for a bit before firing off calls so it fires only when the user stops clicking?
[23:44:24] <rakl> so that if they click 5 states in a row, we don't have to make 5 api calls?
[23:49:05] <erdos> is it possible if i bind a click to div.tony, to tell if the fired event originally came from div.tony > div.someother > div.hithere ?
[23:49:28] <erdos> or... can i bind a click to div.hithere, and pass a message down to div.tony?
[23:53:01] <okdamn> hi all
[23:53:23] <okdamn> i'm trying submit() but if i have a form with file upload it doesn't submits the files what's wrong?
