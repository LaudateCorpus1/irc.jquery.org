[01:48:34] <IffyStiffy> hi
[01:48:50] <IffyStiffy> epecially @cork
[01:49:40] <IffyStiffy> Cork: so what do i call or search for if i have an array of names, and i dont want duplicates from the array to be printed
[01:50:39] <IffyStiffy> Sample: Ally, McBeal, Cork, Superman, Cork. So what do i do? im trying to do this in velocity template language, but juts to get an idea on how it should be done
[02:17:00] <Cork> IffyStiffy: just ask the question, don't highlight random ppl
[02:17:16] <IffyStiffy> its me honey
[02:17:54] <IffyStiffy> anyways i found it, if you wanna have a look at it, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7276608/how-to-remove-duplicate-elements-from-a-list-using-apache-velocity
[02:18:06] <IffyStiffy> what is that function called
[02:18:18] <IffyStiffy> i mean terminology or something, coz it was hell to find it
[02:22:08] <IffyStiffy> thanks hun
[04:41:34] <shai3489> Hello, need your help.. I would like to write code that extract string from long string and then perform some actions on that string and later on put it back to the same position in the long string any idea how I can do that?
[04:45:17] <Uhkis> step 1) go to ##javascript, step 2) show them your code
[04:48:57] <FilipNortic> that more or less assumes that step 0) was "Make a serious atempt at it by yourself"
[05:13:05] <nv-nov> #is this ( function( $ ) {    ( function() { })            ();      } )( jQuery );   a best solution to get rid from conflict issue with other lib or $ ?
[05:14:16] <Sendoushi> nv-nov: there is the "noConflict()" thing but I think that encapsulated function like you did suffices
[05:14:37] <nv-nov> Sendoushi: means ok that ?
[05:14:46] <nv-nov> it will not create conflict issue ?
[05:15:13] <Sendoushi> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[05:16:19] <nv-nov> Sendoushi: some time eerything fails
[05:16:46] <Sendoushi> anyway go with your function encapsulation
[05:17:12] <nv-nov> Sendoushi: just want to confirm is this a good solution means it will not create any issue ?
[05:17:20] <Sendoushi> the way I do things I don't have much issues. the only cdn / global thing i have is jquery and the rest is required through modules
[05:17:58] <Sendoushi> i don't know what you mean by "will not create any issue" it might or might not. it depends on how you're doing things. you should be ok with it
[05:18:05] <nv-nov> ok Sendoushi ;(function($){ wht is that means means ; ???
[05:18:44] <Sendoushi> just to force the new statement. i don't do those.
[05:19:09] <Sendoushi> i prefer to use the ; on the end of the statements and that is way good enough
[08:39:51] <flavioamorim1> Hi everyone, I'm trying to block areas that are not located in red to make the sortable, but when I start the start method, even removing like classes that allow sort, does not work. Like areas in red. As others do not.

[10:48:44] <rjCousineau> Hello.  I have a list of files with icons. I have a mouseover event where the user can hover over the icon and display a preview.  My issue is $(item).on('mouseout') event doesn't always fire (if the user moves over the icon very fast) and I often have 'previews' stuck open.  https://jsfiddle.net/ypfe6k5a/  -- I've tried many different solutions, including $(document).on('mouseover') to close
[10:48:44] <rjCousineau> the lightbox.. this works, but it feels wrong
[10:51:41] <AdamPDotty> first of all I'd need to know whwy you do not use hover state.
[10:53:09] <rjCousineau> because I need to delegate events to future elements
[11:02:12] <rjCousineau> This is a complete example of my problem.. the image stays 'stuck' on when mouseover too fast. https://jsfiddle.net/ypfe6k5a/1/
[11:02:59] <rjCousineau> I've been fighting with this one for a while, would anyone be able to see how I can handle capturing the events better?
[11:05:43] <Mo0O> hi there
[11:07:56] <Mo0O> given this exemple: http://jsfiddle.net/arunpjohny/z9jes/ do you know if it's possible to replace "Headline" by "whatever" if "a" tag content is "Headline" and vice versa
[11:07:57] <Mo0O> ?
[11:09:33] <rjCousineau> Mo0O: http://jsfiddle.net/z9jes/247/
[11:12:48] <Mo0O> rjCousineau: thanks, sorry I didn't explained well my problem, but I'm looking for a way to inspect "a" tags content in order to set "a" tags attribute, depending on the content
[11:13:42] <AdamPDotty> you could set data-now="Headline"; data-next="whatever", then juggle
[11:13:53] <rjCousineau> var $a = $('a');  $a.attr( 'attr', $a.text() );
[11:15:05] <AdamPDotty> a.text(a.data('next')); a.data('next', a.data('now')); a.data('now', a.text());
[11:15:49] <AdamPDotty> or you could have both texts in their own tags and toggle visibility
[11:17:05] <Mo0O> in pseudo code it more looks like this: if a.href == '/foo'; then a.href = a.href + '?query=' + a.text; else if a.href == '/bar'; then a.href = a.href + '?arg=' + a.content; done
[11:17:30] <AdamPDotty> <a><span>one</span><span class="hidden">other</span></a> a.find('span').toggleClass('hidden');
[11:26:20] <Dijok> Hi, can anyhelp me with some JQuery scripting? PM me please
[11:26:33] <Mo0O> yes, that's not as easy as simply replace without condition
[11:26:48] <Mo0O> Dijok: don't ask to ask just ask
[11:27:41] <Dijok> http://codepen.io/iMKay/pen/eWZzXE I'm having trouble printing out this script
[11:27:55] <Dijok> Just prints out the first result
[11:29:07] <Mo0O> Dijok: it's a fizz buzz game :D
[11:30:58] <Dijok> Just doing some random exercises ; ) How would I print out the whole string instead of just the first one?
[11:33:55] <whoisaCe> Has anybody used async.js before in here? And can help out in ##javascript? Thanks!!
[11:37:28] <Mo0O> Dijok: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bWpwdp
[11:38:21] <Mo0O> update with FizzBuzz :P
[11:38:53] <Dijok> @Mo0O I see, thanks a lot dude : )
[11:38:58] <Mo0O> np ;)
[11:40:25] <rjCousineau> Hi, the image becomes 'stuck' on when mouseover image too fast. https://jsfiddle.net/ypfe6k5a/1/  Does anyone know a solultion?
[11:41:02] <maslo> if I use $('[data-col=X]') to select all elements that have this attribute...is there anyway to select a range? all elements from X to x+3 kinda thing? (x being a number)
[11:42:41] <rjCousineau> maslo: that selector will be very slow, but you can .foreach() and if( $(this).data('col') == N
[11:44:53] <maslo> so loop all the elements with data-col and then do check afterward?
[11:45:04] <maslo> it was what I had thought of but I figured there must be something better
[11:45:55] <maslo> there shouldn't be more than let's say 10-20 elements with data-col but was still hoping for a better alternative
[11:47:59] <rjCousineau> $('[data-col=N1], [data-col=N2], [data-col=N3]')
[11:48:47] <maslo> not a bad idea
[11:49:08] <maslo> thank you very much
[12:18:36] <decx> no maslo
[13:03:37] <maslo> what decx?
[13:14:22] <decx> maslo get all you items in a collection and use filter()
[14:08:50] <mikesrike> Hello everyone. I want my script to work this way: select first element with class 'animated' and add class "after", wait one second and then add class 'after' to the next 'animated' element and so on for all the elements, but instead my script adds class 'after' to all 'animated' elements at once. Code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/691ae74c1260749bc5cedbaf02f5ede5
[14:09:27] <taplar_> setTimeout is a non-blocking method
[14:09:30] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:09:38] <taplar_> meaning it will each over every element performing that logic
[14:09:46] <mikesrike> Which method should I use?
[14:10:22] <taplar_> think of it like this
[14:10:32] <taplar_> perform logic on X
[14:10:43] <taplar_> err, hold on
[14:11:27] <taplar_> function doSomething (X) { /*....*/  setTimeout(function(){ doSomething(X + 1) }, 1000); }  doSomething(firstValue);
[14:11:43] <taplar_> should give you some thoughts
[14:13:45] <mikesrike> You forgot a semicolon
[14:13:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:14:00] <taplar_> i forgot alot of things
[14:14:05] <taplar_> it's just to get you started
[14:16:33] * taplar_ starts singing black eyed peas
[14:35:17] <decx> just set transitionDelay with an incremented by your indices before you add your class
[14:35:49] <decx> .css('transitionDelay', function(i){ return i*500+'ms'; }).addClass('active')

[15:39:39] <Es0teric> i have this.. https://jsfiddle.net/0gx1roq7/1/ i am trying to update the count on click to be a +1 or -1.. but it doesnt seem to be working
[15:40:23] <robertmaxrees> erm
[15:40:34] <robertmaxrees> where do you define "clicked"
[15:41:00] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees on the list item.. https://jsfiddle.net/0gx1roq7/2/
[15:41:02] <robertmaxrees> also: $emojiButton is also undefined there.
[15:41:13] <Es0teric> oh snap i forgot to add that lol
[15:42:03] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sh68bs6h/
[15:43:09] <robertmaxrees> open your console on that second one.
[15:44:07] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/0gx1roq7/3/
[15:44:32] <robertmaxrees> go look at that fiddle i posted and open your console
[15:44:36] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah i know... i just forgot to add the $emojiButton var
[15:44:37] <Es0teric> thats all
[15:44:41] <Es0teric> but thats the updated one
[15:44:42] <robertmaxrees> heh nope.
[15:44:49] <robertmaxrees> you also have to define clicked before you can use it.
[15:45:35] <Es0teric> https://jsfiddle.net/0gx1roq7/4/
[15:45:36] <Es0teric> yeah
[15:45:44] <Es0teric> i was doing that... totally forgot about that too =_=
[15:45:44] * taplar_ is thinking about adding "triage programming" to his linkedin skill set
[15:45:54] <Es0teric> lol taplar_
[15:46:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0gx1roq7/5/ Es0teric
[15:46:51] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i dont get it.. whats different?
[15:47:00] <robertmaxrees> i just added a console log.
[15:47:03] <robertmaxrees> helping you narrow down the issuer,.
[15:48:04] <robertmaxrees> here: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0gx1roq7/6/
[15:48:12] <robertmaxrees> that should help clarify some more.
[15:49:06] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecing .prev() to do here?
[15:49:26] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok so i was thinking that since the current target is the emoji button, since the count is outside of the anchor that i should just go up one
[15:49:56] <robertmaxrees> "up one"?
[15:50:01] <Es0teric> up one element
[15:50:05] <robertmaxrees> so do you want the previous element or the parent element?
[15:50:12] <Es0teric> previous
[15:50:19] <robertmaxrees> there's no previous element though.
[15:50:21] <Es0teric> i mean thats what made sense to me at the time =_=
[15:50:23] <robertmaxrees> a'
[15:50:31] <robertmaxrees> *the only sibling of that a is the next one.
[15:50:35] <robertmaxrees> there's no previous.
[15:50:41] <Es0teric> ok
[15:50:45] <Es0teric> so then how do i get the .count ?
[15:50:59] <robertmaxrees> well i just have you a big hint ;)
[15:51:52] <Es0teric> .next() /
[15:51:53] <Es0teric> ?
[15:52:08] <robertmaxrees> or just replace that .prev() with .parent()
[15:52:26] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees see i was thinking of doing that but i didnt think it would have worked
[15:52:32] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[15:52:37] <robertmaxrees> you want the parent element.
[15:53:28] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees but its still zero
[15:53:37] <Es0teric> its not what the .count class really contans
[15:53:39] <robertmaxrees> right, but now you have the correct element.
[15:53:43] <Es0teric> i mean .count div
[15:53:50] <robertmaxrees> *sub
[15:53:52] <robertmaxrees> not div
[15:53:56] <Es0teric> right
[15:54:04] <robertmaxrees> and you now have the right element - you're confused about what count++ does
[15:54:51] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Increment_()
[15:54:54] <robertmaxrees> read this real quick
[15:55:37] <Es0teric> clearly it increments the number representation that is stored in the variable
[15:55:40] <Es0teric> what else would it do?
[15:55:51] <robertmaxrees> dude
[15:55:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:55:53] <robertmaxrees> read the link.
[15:56:01] <robertmaxrees> the first two bullet points tell you the issue,.
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> "If used postfix, with operator after operand (for example, x++), then it returns the value before incrementing."
[15:56:51] <Es0teric> so then i want ++count
[15:56:53] <Es0teric> not count++
[15:56:54] <Es0teric> right?
[15:56:56] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:57:18] <Es0teric> because i want it to return whatever the value is before it adds it by one
[15:57:26] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:57:32] <robertmaxrees> you want the incremented value.
[15:57:36] <robertmaxrees> not the value before it's incremented.
[15:58:06] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees so then i want the same for count--
[15:58:06] <Es0teric> right?
[15:58:10] <Es0teric> it should be --count
[15:58:10] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:58:12] <robertmaxrees> err, yes
[15:58:16] <robertmaxrees> you want the previx notation
[15:58:27] <robertmaxrees> (*prefix
[15:59:14] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok so i have this spitting out the count
[15:59:20] <Es0teric> the text sub doesnt change
[15:59:25] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have now.
[15:59:36] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/0gx1roq7/11/
[15:59:47] <robertmaxrees> ... heh
[15:59:53] <robertmaxrees> you're not setting the text now.
[16:00:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0gx1roq7/12/
[16:00:10] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:00:18] <Es0teric> dude i had that there =_=
[16:53:46] <Es0teric> the var clicked doesnt seem to go between true and false.. https://jsfiddle.net/0gx1roq7/11/ every time a click occurs
[17:02:03] <taplar_> when would it be false?
[17:02:26] <taplar_> you're setting it to true on line 5
[18:37:52] <printForever> Can I e.preventDefault and then continue?
[18:37:58] <printForever> I have a <form> I want to submit
[18:38:14] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[18:38:17] <printForever> I wanted to check email field with jQuery before submiting
[18:38:31] <printForever> robertmaxrees: maybe with .trigger()?
[18:38:43] <robertmaxrees> you have a couple options:
[18:39:09] <robertmaxrees> 1: check the docs for trigger and on - have the trigger pass in a special flag that on looks for and prevent only if it doesn't exist.
[18:39:32] <robertmaxrees> 2: call the native dom submit() method, which basically bypasses jquery's handler entirely.
[18:41:39] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[18:42:17] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/w0332Lde/
[18:42:42] <printForever> it does
[18:42:56] <printForever> what am I doing wrong in my fiddle?
[18:43:09] <robertmaxrees> neither of the things I suggested.
[18:43:23] <robertmaxrees> first off
[18:43:24] <robertmaxrees> $('#pt-subscribe button').on('click', function(e) { should be $('#subscribe').on('submit', function(e) {
[18:43:51] <robertmaxrees> second, just do one of the two things I suggested.
[18:43:52] <printForever> sorry, updated it... https://jsfiddle.net/w0332Lde/1/
[18:44:03] <robertmaxrees> still using a click handler.
[18:44:20] <robertmaxrees> and those are both identical.
[18:44:32] <printForever> please check the fiddle
[18:44:37] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[18:44:42] <printForever> I'm using the submit buttons for 3 things
[18:44:56] <printForever> 1. open input field, 2. hide input field. 3. submit.
[18:45:07] <robertmaxrees> literally none of that changes my suggestion >.>
[18:45:13] <printForever> Thing that I can't do is 3.
[18:45:18] <printForever> ok
[18:45:55] <printForever> I have no idea what is preevent
[18:47:04] <printForever> oh sorry
[18:47:08] <printForever> its almost 1AM
[18:47:12] <printForever> prevent
[18:48:42] <Buoy172> printForever, why didn't you include jquery script tag there so we can actually run the fiddle
[18:49:12] <printForever> Buoy172 I did in an update
[18:51:40] <Buoy172> printForever: when you click 'subscribe' it should open up first, and then the second click should validate and send email, right?
[18:51:53] <printForever> yes
[18:52:03] <printForever> I added jQuery but it doesent work
[18:52:06] <printForever> it works locally
[18:52:54] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/w0332Lde/8/
[18:53:09] <printForever> but it always executes Buoy172, robertmaxrees
[18:53:22] <printForever> jsfiddle sucks
[18:55:55] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:56:10] <robertmaxrees> $('#pt-subscribe button') isn't the element you want.
[18:57:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/w0332Lde/14/
[18:57:22] <Buoy172> printForever: what are you trying to do? What's the problem?
[18:57:24] <robertmaxrees> this seewms to work.
[18:58:21] <Buoy172> idiot left
[18:58:25] <robertmaxrees> hey now.
[18:58:28] <robertmaxrees> no need to be nasty.
[18:58:34] <Buoy172> he left, so wtf
[18:58:36] <robertmaxrees> people get frustrated sometimes.
[18:58:42] <robertmaxrees> and get sidetracked.  no big.
[18:59:07] <Buoy172> I'm not insulting anyone here. He can't see what I said.
[18:59:23] <robertmaxrees> no need to call him an idiot.
[18:59:37] <Buoy172> I got angry because I worked on a solution and could help him
[18:59:45] <Buoy172> so he's an idiot :P
[18:59:46] <robertmaxrees> it happens :)
[19:00:00] <robertmaxrees> nah, not an idiot.  people get pulled away all the time.  i wouldn't take it personally.
[19:00:14] <Buoy172> whatever, I'm already over it :)
[19:00:39] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[19:06:05] <Motoservo> What’s the best way to watch for the last of a group of ajax calls that are fired after page load?
[19:06:28] <Motoservo> ajaxComplete is fired after every call, right?
[19:06:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd pop all the calls into an array and then use $.when()
[19:07:44] <Motoservo> Okay, I’ll look into this. Thanks, robertmaxrees
[19:07:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:23:20] <Motoservo> So, robertmaxrees, when there are numerous ajax calls coming from various places in the code, this wouldn’t be feasible?
[19:23:28] <robertmaxrees> kind of depends.
[19:23:36] <robertmaxrees> there are a variety of ways to accomplish it.
[19:24:04] <Motoservo> I’m trying to set up a timer that shows the page load and then adds in the time lapsed to the last ajax response.
[19:24:13] <robertmaxrees> erm, why?
[19:24:18] <robertmaxrees> your dev tools should have that already.
[19:24:20] <Motoservo> And it’s a big site, in Laravel. Broken up all over the place.
[19:24:29] <Motoservo> showing the user.
[19:24:35] <Motoservo> It’s an internal site.
[19:24:53] <robertmaxrees> so they care, but don't want to use the developer tools to do it?
[19:25:02] <Motoservo> They aren’t developers.
[19:25:17] <robertmaxrees> kinda weird that they care enough to know, but OK.
[19:25:29] <robertmaxrees> and you can still do this.
[19:25:38] <Motoservo> It’s for reporting purposes when they talk to the devs.
[19:25:58] <robertmaxrees> oh.  we do stuff like that, but we just track their userId and then let our reporting tools do the rest.
[19:26:00] <robertmaxrees> either wayu.
[19:27:00] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/d97be3cc057e
[19:27:04] <robertmaxrees> you can do something like this.
[19:27:30] <Motoservo> Okay, I’ll chew on that for a bit. Thanks.
[19:27:45] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/e22a49dc0d99
[19:27:56] <robertmaxrees> you'll wind up with something like this.
[19:29:20] <Motoservo> Looking over that first link. That would require updating each place there’s an ajax call?
[19:29:43] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:30:22] <Motoservo> Yeah could be awhile for me to track them all down. Was hoping for a catchall. We have big dashboards with up to 6 to 12 calls per page.
[19:30:44] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to have to be checking on intervals which will give you inaccurate data.
[19:30:46] <Motoservo> This answers my question though. I think I’ll need to leave the ajax portion of the time stamp out of it.
[19:30:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd look into some kind of RUM system instead.
[19:31:09] <robertmaxrees> plenty of those offer what you're looking for.
[19:31:35] <Motoservo> yeah, was thinking just setting a counter but that wouldn’t work if some ajax finished before others even started.
[19:31:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:31:51] <robertmaxrees> check out Real User Monitoring tho.
[19:32:09] <Motoservo> I think that’s where I snagged this part of what I’m doing…
[19:32:10] <Motoservo> performance.timing.navigationStart
[19:32:30] <robertmaxrees> why not just save the man hours and buy a solution?
[19:32:32] <Motoservo> But what I setup seems only good for time to load.
[19:32:55] <Motoservo> Yeah, might end up going that way. I’ll bounce it off of them. Thanks.
[19:41:48] <Motoservo> Actually, I think I got it. I just have each ajaxComplete add a now() to original load and write over the previous.
[19:42:17] <robertmaxrees> how do you know if they all fired?
[19:42:21] <Motoservo> a getTime, anyway. Speaking generally.
[19:42:24] <robertmaxrees> what if one of them errors?
[19:42:49] <Motoservo> Good point. Might be incomplete. But should et most of the way.
[19:43:03] <robertmaxrees> heh, i highly suggest looking into a service still.
[19:43:13] <Motoservo> I will, thanks. Curious now.
[21:30:37] <DillyD> Hey
[22:06:53] <DillyD> can someone help with a testdome question? its supposed to be on easy mode
[23:32:57] <raul782> Hey guys, I have an iframe that loads jquery 3.3.2 inside to display a modal, and on the main page, a jquery is loaded with an older version.
[23:33:14] <raul782> I get this error: Uncaught TypeError: $(...).find(...).modal is not a function
[23:33:39] <raul782> is that an indication that jquery is somehow having a conflict, so it seems like it hasn't been loaded?
[23:33:43] <raul782> or this is something else?
