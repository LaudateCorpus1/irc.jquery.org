[07:30:48] <diverdude> Why does this give 0? jQuery.inArray( "freehand", ["freehand","eraser","roi-box"])
[07:31:47] <diverdude> ahh its the index, ok
[07:42:06] <Cork> ya, inArray returns -1 if it doesn't exist
[20:01:38] <Unplesantry> o/
[20:01:56] <Unplesantry> how to find first form field in div
[20:02:03] <Unplesantry> any type
[21:10:51] <Sveta> $anchor.nextUntil( "h2" ) <-- how do I modify this line to include the case there is no next h2 and I want to just select everything that remains until the end of the parent?
