[00:02:34] <afidegnum> ok, I used a different script which seems to work
[00:23:00] <subdesign> hi, if a jquery function hasn't callback, how to run other jquery function if the prev. has finished?
[00:23:46] <shoky> subdesign: what function?
[00:23:58] <subdesign> attr
[00:24:00] <subdesign> paste:
[00:24:08] <shoky> subdesign: you just call the second one after the first..
[00:24:32] <subdesign> http://pastie.org/4689057
[00:24:55] <subdesign> shoky, ok but it seems not to work
[00:24:58] <shoky> .attr() returns immediately
[00:25:04] <shoky> you want to wait till the image is loaded?
[00:25:16] <subdesign> yes
[00:25:35] <subdesign> i want to scroll down to the form after new code generated
[00:25:48] <shoky> $('#captcha').attr('src',...).load( function() {  do the rest } );
[00:26:01] <shoky> actually maybe it's better to to the .load before the .attr
[00:26:06] <shoky> not sure
[00:26:16] <shoky> but that's safest if not sure ;p
[00:26:18] <subdesign> checking..
[00:27:41] <subdesign> first hind doesnt work
[00:27:44] <subdesign> hint
[00:28:04] <shoky> what?
[00:28:12] <subdesign> what you suggested first
[00:28:42] <shoky> then i said something possibly better
[00:29:50] <shoky> you know it'll put the same url on each click, yeah?
[00:30:05] <subdesign> yes
[00:30:09] <shoky> k
[00:30:21] <subdesign> generates always new codes
[00:31:01] <shoky> yea but.. from the same url
[00:31:27] <subdesign> you mean its security leak?
[00:31:30] <shoky> no
[00:31:59] <shoky> i mean, if the 'src' attr doesn't change, nothing new will get loaded, i think
[00:32:25] <subdesign> no, it works trust me :)
[00:32:39] <shoky> and the .load doesnt work?
[00:32:57] <subdesign> i try to find a way how to use .load
[00:33:06] <subdesign> $(" ? ").load() ?
[00:33:20] <shoky> ?
[00:33:43] <shoky> ?.load
[00:33:44] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[00:33:54] <subdesign> load this animate thing to what?
[00:34:32] <shoky> to the image element
[00:43:02] <shoky> subdesign: this might be a good way to do it http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KwLQn/
[00:44:21] <subdesign> shoky, the image loading works, but to scroll effect doesnt run
[00:44:51] <shoky> try it this way.
[00:45:22] <shoky> don't want to keep .load()ing on the same element on each click
[00:45:32] <subdesign> ok
[00:53:51] <subdesign> ok clear you give a solution getting new code clicking on the image :)
[00:59:58] <subdesign> oh year you rocks mate :)
[01:00:07] <subdesign> thx shocky
[01:00:13] <subdesign> shoky
[01:01:59] <shoky> ;]
[01:02:16] <subdesign> i even dont need to instantiate a new image as i see
[01:02:53] <subdesign> and had a big mistake in my code had two #captcha ids :/
[01:05:19] <shoky> if you don't instantiate a new image you'll keep stacking up the .load()s i think..
[01:06:44] <shoky> unless you do img.onload = function() { ... }
[01:15:18] <subdesign> i see
[01:16:16] <subdesign> i use it anyway with this animation has a nice user experience
[01:32:20] <Hopsy> how do I detect 404 image's?
[01:47:00] <shoky> Hopsy: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KwLQn/1/
[01:47:36] <shoky> error event
[01:49:13] <Hopsy> shoky: will this work in all browsers?
[01:49:31] <shoky> dont know if it's reliable
[01:50:02] <shoky> works for me in chrome/ff/ie9
[02:01:01] <optraz> when i submit a http post to the server, what is the way to refresh the data display in the client browser? what should i do or change in the code?
[02:13:51] <afidegnum> hello, pls I wan to find out if mobile devices support all jquery codes and extensions? or unless jquery mobile have to be integrated?
[02:16:41] <afidegnum> any anser ?
[02:53:45] <shoky> optraz: there is no 'the way'. what do you wanna do exactly, what have you tried so far
[02:56:54] <optraz> shoky: i have three drop down select, when user alter a drop down select field, i want the table below refresh automatically. what i have done so far is to post the field back to the server. i do not know what/how to refresh the data in the table.

[03:27:37] <Gandalf84> Hi
[03:27:45] * Hopsy Beethoven yeah
[03:27:52] <Gandalf84> can I take an object knowing part of its id?
[03:28:08] <beachandbytes> yes
[03:28:14] <Gandalf84> I have a form with ids: image_0, Image_1, ... I want to take all the Image_*
[03:28:53] <Gandalf84> how?
[03:30:20] <coldhead> Gandalf84: http://jsbin.com/axufus/1/edit
[03:31:02] <Gandalf84> thank you
[03:31:14] <coldhead> here are the docs: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[03:31:21] <Hopsy> nice website coldhead
[03:31:44] <beachandbytes> Gandalf84, $('[id^="image"]')
[03:32:20] <Hopsy> jsfiddle doesnt give the option to hide html/css/js
[03:32:34] <coldhead> its much fancier than jsfiddle
[03:32:38] <coldhead> and it updates live
[03:35:41] <Tobbi> Hello. So the issue I'm having is this one: I'm loading an external HTML file via jquery ajax and inserting a part of the document with a style attribute into another document. I can see the style attribute and it certainly is valid CSS, but I don't see the styles actually getting applied to the document. Anyone have any idea why?
[03:36:04] <Tobbi> (oh, and cross-origin-policy does not apply as both of these documents are on localhost.
[03:36:05] <Tobbi> )]
[03:36:20] <beachandbytes> Tobbi what is the style?
[03:36:42] <Tobbi> beachandbytes: style attribute of one of the elements is this: left: 15px; top: 175px; background-image: url(../img/Anonymous_Image.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: contain; width: 174px; height: 174px;
[03:36:48] <Tobbi> Is that what you wanted?
[03:37:19] <beachandbytes> do you have it inline or in a css style sheet?
[03:37:30] <afidegnum> hello, pls I wan to find out if mobile devices support all jquery codes and extensions? or unless jquery mobile have to be integrated?
[03:37:34] <beachandbytes> not that it should matter
[03:37:49] <beachandbytes> afidegnum jquery mobile
[03:38:24] <Tobbi> beachandbytes: It's inline.
[03:38:26] <afidegnum> beachandbytes: I don't understand
[03:38:42] <afidegnum> does it mean we have to use jquery mobile functions only ?
[03:38:46] <gen0cide> Im having a problem, Im trying to refresh a div which has an image that doesnt change. I have to click the submit button multiple times for the new version of the image to show up, even though its already been updated on the server
[03:38:53] <gen0cide> What could be  causing this?
[03:39:52] <beachandbytes> afidegnum, you should only expect jquery mobile functionality to work on a mobile site
[03:40:36] <gen0cide> I meant a div with an image inside with, which the name of the img doesnt change, but but the img itself does.
[03:40:36] <afidegnum> hmm ok
[03:42:05] <beachandbytes> gen0cide, caching is happening
[03:42:54] <gen0cide> beachandbytes: Im generating a random string at the end useing date().gettime()
[03:43:37] <gen0cide> beachandbytes:  http://pastebin.com/0iyLV4zJ
[03:48:45] <beachandbytes> gen0cide, it looks fine
[03:49:25] <gen0cide> beachandbytes: It doesnt work 100% though
[03:49:50] <gen0cide> I have to click the submit a couple of times for the new version to be displayed
[03:49:52] <beachandbytes> you should substring the image src and remove the query paramaters
[03:50:00] <beachandbytes> before appending more
[03:50:18] <beachandbytes> otherwise you will get image.jpg?random?random?random?random
[03:50:24] <beachandbytes> which may be why
[03:51:42] <gen0cide> beachandbytes: Alright, how would I do that? heh
[03:54:45] <beachandbytes> gen0cide, $('img').attr('src').substring(0,$('img').attr('src').indexOf('?');
[04:01:08] <sahbeewah> that will fail horribly if there isn't a '?'...
[04:03:03] <beachandbytes> add an if(string.indexOf('?' != -1))
[04:13:05] <Gandalf84> http://pastebin.com/FD860whH
[04:13:15] <Gandalf84> it says Invalid parameter number: number of bound variables does not match number of tokens
[04:15:49] <Gandalf84> am I creating a wrong query?
[04:23:39] <monsieur_h> hi there
[04:24:18] <pathou> hi
[04:28:49] <burg> hello. are there any known bugs to slideUp ? because in some situations it just acts like hide(), without animation
[04:29:52] <sahbeewah> doesn't work with table rows
[04:34:54] <burg> sahbeewah: yes, i was actually having problems with a table row. do you know any workaround?
[04:39:53] <sahbeewah> um yeah i remember a workaround
[04:40:09] <sahbeewah> you wrap the content in a div and slide that
[04:40:14] <sahbeewah> should be googlable
[04:40:45] <burg> thank you
[04:46:21] <beachandbytes> who was I helping with the QR code thing?
[05:01:51] <Drager> Any idea how I can fade in after a submit? I have poll and I want the poll to fadein when the users vote
[05:01:57] <Drager> then the results will be shown
[06:13:56] <optraz> i have 5 buttons, how do i write a general jquery code so when this button is click, the input is enable?
[06:14:11] <optraz> note: each input has its own button.
[06:17:40] <dns-away> api.jquery.com/click/
[06:17:52] <dns-away> $('#fieldName').attr("disabled", true)/false
[06:18:17] <dns-away> close/
[06:20:20] <optraz> dns-away: it enable all the five fields..
[06:20:27] <optraz> i only want the current field enable...
[06:20:44] <manu91> ciao
[06:20:46] <manu91> !list
[06:21:21] <sunbeam> i like to code my first psd design to a responsive template. any ideas where i can best start to learn this?
[06:22:43] <flying_fortress> using $.get('bla.html', function(data){ console.log($('body',data)) }); I should log everything inside the body element of the loaded bla.html document into the console, yes?
[06:42:41] <shoky> flying_fortress: you cant console.log into anything but the console
[06:42:44] <optraz> how do i change the text of a input when the button is click?
[06:43:20] <flying_fortress> shoky, I am merely trying to verify the data I get from the html document
[06:43:40] <shoky> flying_fortress: console.log(data)  and check your console..
[06:43:47] <flying_fortress> yes that works
[06:43:58] <flying_fortress> however, I only need the contents of the body element
[06:44:01] <shoky> oh
[06:44:13] <flying_fortress> and I can't for the life of me get them extracted
[06:44:35] <shoky> $(data).find('body') ?
[06:45:13] <shoky> that is - $(data).find('body').html()
[06:45:27] <shoky> i think
[06:45:50] <flying_fortress> the last returns 963undefined
[06:45:53] <flying_fortress> undefined
[06:45:59] <shoky> actually that wouldnt work if body is the root element
[06:46:28] <wolfehr> hey guys, when binding change() to a form, how can I determine which input has been changed when the change is called?
[06:46:28] <flying_fortress> we are talking about a valid html document
[06:46:43] <flying_fortress> including doctype and head etc
[06:47:09] <dns-away> /head
[06:47:29] <optraz> any idea?
[06:47:32] <optraz> how do i change the text of a input when the button is click?
[06:49:02] <flying_fortress> optraz, http://api.jquery.com/click/
[06:49:08] <wolfehr> ah, there's a target property which shows which child triggered the event
[06:49:33] <optraz> flying_fortress: i have that.. but i just dont how to access the input field before the input type button
[06:50:07] <flying_fortress> does it have a class, a name or an id?
[06:50:51] <flying_fortress> well, it should have a name
[06:51:36] <optraz> flying_fortress: yes, it have class and name
[06:52:30] <shoky> flying_fortress: some elements are stripped out so you can't count on <body> being there
[06:53:18] <flying_fortress> optraz => $('input[name="blaaa"]').attr('value','new text'); should work?
[06:54:34] <flying_fortress> shoky, I see, any idea about how to work around that?
[06:54:51] <shoky> flying_fortress: don't serve up a full html document, just the fragment you need
[06:54:54] <optraz> flying_fortress: thanks. but i wish not to hardcode the name.. i want a general case..
[06:55:00] <flying_fortress> not an option I am afraid
[06:55:14] <defaultro> hey folks, e.latlng.toString() is including the string "LatLng" in front of the string. How do I remove that?
[06:55:19] <optraz> flying_fortress: i have the input type text follow by a button. so whenever the button is click, the text of the previous input type text is change.
[06:56:01] <shoky> flying_fortress: then you might have to do some manual parsing or find some lib to help with it, donno
[06:56:18] <flying_fortress> mhhhh I see, thanks for the info :)
[06:56:52] <flying_fortress> optraz, <input /><button /> ?
[06:57:06] <optraz> flying_fortress: exactly
[06:57:13] <flying_fortress> http://api.jquery.com/prev/ ?
[06:57:32] <shoky> flying_fortress: but,
[06:57:43] <shoky> flying_fortress: you do have the contents of the body element when you do $(data)
[06:57:54] <shoky> they're just not in a <body> node perhaps
[06:58:00] <flying_fortress> + the title etc
[06:58:19] <shoky> for example when i do: $('<!doctype html><html><head><title>a</title></head><body><p>hehee</p></body></html>')
[06:58:51] <shoky> i get back a jquery collection of: [[<title>?a?</title>?, <p>?hehee?</p>?]
[06:58:53] <optraz> flying_fortress: thanks! prev() works.. i use .before()  just now dont work
[06:58:59] <shoky> er without the question mars
[06:59:01] <shoky> k
[06:59:23] <flying_fortress> meta tags etc. are also included
[06:59:47] <shoky> aye, it's browser dependent
[06:59:53] <flying_fortress> and as the documents will be valid html documents but presumably varying order of head elements and number of contents this would be problematic
[07:00:06] <shoky> aye
[07:00:11] <flying_fortress> hence my need to only grab the body parts :D
[07:02:28] <Chuguniy> Hi. Could someone take a look at this http://pastebin.com/AneCsurp function, why I can't get a value of resourceContent variable in function call? Thanks!
[07:05:32] <shoky> flying_fortress: you could try: $(/<body.*<\/body>/i.exec(data)[0])   :\
[07:06:31] <flying_fortress> TypeError: 'null' is not an object (evaluating '/<body.*<\/body>/i.exec(data)[0]') ?
[07:08:16] <shoky> worked for me :\
[07:08:30] <shoky> but on simple data: '<!doctype html><html><head><title>a</title></head><body><p>hehee<img/></p><p>lol</p></boDY></html>'
[07:09:32] <tash> looks like opacity isn't working in IE9, but is in FF.  Anyone ran into that before?
[07:10:29] <flying_fortress> mhhhh
[07:16:51] <victorkk> please, help

[07:19:09] <victorkk> anyone?
[07:20:02] <tash> victorkk: idk that plugin, have you checked out google to see if anyone else is reporting that? Or, checked with the plugin author?
[07:20:17] <tash> i'm not a jq expert by any means
[07:20:28] <flying_fortress> shoky, I guess bodyhtml= data.split('<body>').pop().split('</body>')[0]; will do for now >.>
[07:20:28] <victorkk> yes, digging in google all day
[07:21:15] <victorkk> no other reports, the plugin author is not developing this anymore
[07:21:23] <victorkk> the last changes are made in 2009 :(
[07:22:07] <tash> yikes
[07:23:56] <victorkk> tash, that's why i am asking here :/
[07:24:19] <victorkk> i know it is a big plugin... but if you check the test case... with 1.7.2 works fine
[07:24:26] <victorkk> maybe something deprecated?
[07:27:47] <victorkk> anyone?
[07:29:34] <tash> victorkk: not sure, are you getting error in firebug?
[07:29:46] <tash> idk how much help I can be as I still consider myself a n00b

[07:39:21] <victorkk> plese, anyone?
[07:40:27] <scar> victorkk: try to contact the plugin maker.... i did not look into the details of your question though
[07:41:00] <victorkk> the plugin maker is a company, the plugin page is with closed comments...
[07:42:15] <victorkk> scar: can you take a look in jsbin? maybe you can help
[07:51:42] <scar> victorkk: i am not sure i would be able to help on that :\

[09:57:39] <wfq> hi guys
[10:01:04] <wfq> is there anyway to get an element that is contained within another one but that is not a direct child. Something like div->div->ul... I'd like to get the ul which is two levels away from the first div. Unfortunately I just know the id of the firt div
[10:01:28] <wfq> the class of the ul is the same for several elements, hence I did not try by using the class name
[10:01:43] <Couto> wfq div.querySelector('div ul');
[10:02:10] <callumacrae> wfq: .find
[10:02:11] <Spikes> Or $('initSelector').find('another element deep inside');
[10:02:16] <callumacrae> If I can work out how to use the bot…
[10:02:17] <callumacrae> ?find
[10:02:24] <callumacrae> Nope xD
[10:02:28] <Couto> oh right… I forgot this was the jquery room =P
[10:02:33] <wfq> hahaha
[10:02:55] <wfq> thanks guys for your help
[10:03:10] <callumacrae> No problem

[10:10:09] <Chuguniy> How to trigger .animate() without a .click() or other simillar event? I need it to activate when the code is executed.
[10:25:26] <defaultro> hey folks, I'm doing an ajax call. I am able to see the object fine in console.log while still inside the ajax via .done(function(json) {}. Inside this function, I have a return json; code. The function that called this is saying it's undefined
[10:26:11] <defaultro> .done(function(json) { return json; }) is  my code
[10:26:55] <defaultro> then on my calling function, I call it like this, var myOjbect = showallitems(); myOjbect is undefined
[10:27:56] <timwis> Hey guys, I'd like to create a single html file for 3 pages, and have the content for each 'page' fetched (ajax) when the page is loaded. Is there a common framework for this or should I just hook #hash changes and exec my code?
[10:28:13] <defaultro> I am sure the return json; is getting called because I placed a breakpoint using Firebug
[10:31:14] <defaultro> http://jsfiddle.net/ARhWY/ is there something wrong with the code?
[10:32:29] <ranza> is there anyway to extract the tap event from jquerymobile only?
[10:32:40] <ranza> i dont really need anything else than the tap event
[10:39:19] <masak> I'm currently reading up on the DOM and its event model. besides the w3c documents, does anyone have good resources on this topic?
[10:40:38] <ravenzz> ?g DOM mdn

[10:40:46] <ravenzz> ^
[10:41:10] <masak> thank you.
[10:41:17] <ravenzz> yw
[10:45:16] <defaultro> damn, passing object via return is not working
[10:45:31] <defaultro> it becomes undefined once it exits out the file
[10:46:34] <monsieur_h> It should be kept between files
[10:46:48] <monsieur_h> Are you sure you returning to the right function?
[10:46:50] <defaultro> no, I am using return
[10:46:53] <defaultro> yes
[10:47:09] <defaultro> i only have one function and I also placed breakpoint and it stepped over the code
[10:47:28] <monsieur_h> pastebin it?
[10:48:00] <defaultro> one sec
[10:50:34] <defaultro> almost done
[10:51:32] <defaultro> here, http://jsfiddle.net/vk6zz
[10:52:01] <defaultro> the first console.log shows the object properly
[10:53:00] <defaultro> monsieur_h, are you seeing any issues on my return code?
[10:53:55] <monsieur_h> That's not the return code itself
[10:54:05] <monsieur_h> It the way you handle your AJAX
[10:54:07] <defaultro> but i want to return that value
[10:54:13] <monsieur_h> A is for Asynchronous
[10:54:27] <defaultro> how come json contains the values i need
[10:54:58] <monsieur_h> So in your main file, your button triggers that ajax function, and immediatly passes through console.log(). Not waiting for the ajax request to complete
[10:55:08] <defaultro> ah'
[10:55:12] <defaultro> i got that part
[10:55:13] <monsieur_h> So your console.log() in main is of course, empty
[10:55:17] <defaultro> yup
[10:55:20] <defaultro> so I do I get it?
[10:55:29] <monsieur_h> You have plenty of ways
[10:55:39] <defaultro> cool :) can't wait to hear solutions
[10:55:48] <monsieur_h> If you intend to display it in your html ?
[10:56:00] <defaultro> yes
[10:56:07] <monsieur_h> -if +Do
[10:56:10] <defaultro> i should use .html()
[10:56:16] <monsieur_h> You can
[10:56:20] <defaultro> k
[10:56:23] <monsieur_h> But, use it in your callback function
[10:56:29] <monsieur_h> not in you main
[10:56:35] <defaultro> k
[10:56:40] <Couto> fire an event when your callback is ready, and just listen for the event to update your html (or something… there's a lot of options)
[10:56:45] <defaultro> callback is the one with ajax code right?
[10:56:53] <monsieur_h> yes
[10:56:55] <defaultro> k
[10:56:59] <Couto> is the .done(function () {}) part
[10:57:06] <defaultro> k
[10:57:34] <monsieur_h> I feel weird, that's the first time I'm not ASKING something on IRC xD
[10:57:52] <defaultro> ?
[10:57:57] <wfq> Ho can I do something like myUlElement.children('li a').each(function(i) {} in order to get the element a of each of my 'li' child?
[10:58:07] <monsieur_h> Most of time, I'm the one begging for answers =)
[10:58:11] <defaultro> wfq, find
[10:58:33] <defaultro> it means you'r learning
[10:59:11] <wfq> I have used find before but I want to iterate at the same time. Can I do find().each()?
[11:00:01] <defaultro> what if I don't want to put it in html, I want to put it in var so I can access it on my main file?
[11:00:08] <wfq> wow that is unbelievable
[11:00:32] <wfq> at the end of the day I am returning a llist of object I can guess. Thanks
[11:00:53] <Couto> defaultro just declare the variable outside of the callback scope and assign it during the callback
[11:00:54] <defaultro> Couto and monsieur_h, that question was for you
[11:01:07] <defaultro> Couto, I did that but it didn't work
[11:01:26] <defaultro> i did it this way
[11:01:29] <Couto> defaultro you still need to realise that is asynchronous so you have to wait for the callback
[11:01:34] <defaultro> var jsonResult: {},
[11:01:51] <defaultro> yup, you're right
[11:02:10] <defaultro> I guess, I have to put my call inside $(document).ready
[11:02:16] <defaultro> right?
[11:02:29] <defaultro> but it's a button call
[11:02:48] <Couto> $(document).ready  has nothing to do with your problem…
[11:02:57] <defaultro> yup, i realized it earlier
[11:03:38] <defaultro> so how can my main use that variable from the other file?
[11:04:56] <monsieur_h> Couto talked about adding an eventlistener
[11:05:02] <monsieur_h> that's a solution
[11:05:03] <defaultro> got it
[11:05:18] <monsieur_h> Or just call the function that deals with your var FROM the .done()
[11:05:20] <defaultro> that would be something cool to learn today
[11:05:29] <monsieur_h> Gotta, cook my BBQ, see ya :)
[11:05:34] <defaultro> cool
[11:06:12] <defaultro> Couto, can you please give me more information about the eventlistener, I'm still confused
[11:06:23] <Couto> The thing is:
[11:06:36] <Couto> you're only able to access the information
[11:06:43] <Couto> after the request is done
[11:06:46] <defaultro> k
[11:06:59] <Couto> so there's no point in thinking about saving it before the request
[11:07:13] <defaultro> k
[11:07:17] <Couto> the event idea
[11:07:27] <Couto> is a way of avoiding callback hell
[11:07:34] <defaultro> k
[11:07:40] <Couto> that is when you have a lot of callback dependent of eachother
[11:07:46] <Couto> your case is simple
[11:07:53] <Couto> so just call the function
[11:08:05] <Couto> you need to call to update the DOM
[11:08:10] <Couto> in the request callback =P
[11:08:23] <defaultro> either by using .html() right
[11:08:34] <Couto> yes
[11:08:37] <defaultro> k
[11:08:50] <defaultro> let me think on how I can iterate to the results
[11:09:18] <defaultro> i figured out now
[11:09:30] <defaultro> i'll make a function that massages the json result
[11:09:42] <defaultro> then I'll call that function in .done or success
[11:10:12] <defaultro> i have to put in my head that javascript is asynchronus
[11:10:14] <defaultro> ous
[11:14:11] <erwagasore> Hi, I have an issue the click event only execute once. And I have used live. Need help
[11:14:50] <Couto> erwagasore can you reproduce that in a jsfiddle.net ??
[11:15:45] <erwagasore> Couto let me do it.
[11:23:40] <defaultro> Cuoto, I'm facing an issue iterating thru my json object
[11:24:15] <defaultro> the jsonResult is an object which contains an object but with a randomly named value
[11:24:39] <defaultro> i converted the json string that I generated from MongoDB into a real json object
[11:24:57] <defaultro> so underneath the random value are my real fields
[11:25:31] <Couto> so it's something like? var obj = { randonKey: {  } }
[11:25:34] <Couto> ??
[11:26:04] <defaultro> json yes
[11:26:08] <defaultro> i mean, Couto yes
[11:26:20] <defaultro> it is autogenerated by mongob
[11:26:21] <Couto> are you worried about IE8 support?
[11:26:47] <defaultro> no
[11:27:00] <Couto> Object.keys(jsonObj)
[11:27:08] <Couto> it will return an array of keys
[11:27:13] <Couto> if you only have one
[11:27:17] <defaultro> ok
[11:27:26] <defaultro> let me show you how I coded it
[11:27:34] <Couto> that you just have to do jsonObj[Object.keys(jsonObj)[0])
[11:27:43] <defaultro> k
[11:27:49] <Couto> but show me
[11:27:51] <Couto> it's better
[11:28:35] <defaultro> http://jsfiddle.net/dBYdU
[11:29:19] <defaultro> items there is wrong
[11:29:29] <defaultro> i was still troubleshooting it in Firebug
[11:29:39] <defaultro> but lat and lon fields are what I need
[11:30:54] <Couto> what's the original json structure?
[11:31:02] <defaultro> like what you wrote above
[11:31:05] <defaultro> double checking
[11:31:31] <defaultro> json is the object
[11:31:46] <defaultro> then inside it is another object but with random name
[11:31:54] <defaultro> inside this random object are lat and lon
[11:32:11] <defaultro> if i where to access it, it would be like this
[11:32:23] <defaultro> json.504cb02c4.lat
[11:32:28] <defaultro> json.504cb02c4.lon
[11:33:21] <Couto> var key = Object.keys(json)[0]; var lat = json[key].lat; var lon = json[key].lon
[11:33:28] <Couto> that ought to be enough
[11:33:35] <defaultro> cool
[11:33:39] <defaultro> trying now
[11:34:02] <Couto> I'm assuming the JSON Object only has one key
[11:34:13] <defaultro> you mean the random key?
[11:34:20] <defaultro> if so, no, there are tons
[11:34:33] <Couto> then you really need the each
[11:34:47] <defaultro> how do I change that code you wrote for each?
[11:35:00] <Couto> $.each(json, function(i, item){
[11:35:00] <Couto>                                 var lat = item.lat,
[11:35:00] <Couto>                                     lon = item.lon
[11:35:00] <Couto>                         });
[11:35:05] <Couto> sorry for the flood
[11:35:11] <defaultro> np
[11:35:55] <defaultro> that won't work for me because of the random object name
[11:36:33] <Couto> give it a try =)
[11:36:44] <Couto> otherwise just show me the error message=)
[11:36:49] <defaultro> k
[11:39:30] <defaultro> BAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[11:39:35] <defaultro> :D
[11:39:43] <defaultro> is the var key needed?
[11:39:50] <defaultro> i think it;s not anymore
[11:39:57] <defaultro> am I right?
[11:40:06] <Couto> for that last example… it's not
[11:40:20] <defaultro> that is so sweet!!!!!!!!!!!
[11:40:20] <Couto> i was assuming you only had one key
[11:40:33] <defaultro> I am so extremely happy!!!! :D
[11:40:37] <defaultro> thank you so much!!!
[11:40:53] <Couto> np
[11:41:25] <defaultro> when I clicked the button, Show Markers, the markers got displayed. I feel like my map exercise looks more professional, hahaha
[11:42:42] <defaultro> this is enough for this hour, :D, I'll help my wife first, hehehe
[12:01:35] <SomeDude> hi all
[12:02:11] <SomeDude> i have a question using the ".on" function to bind an event
[12:02:32] <Couto> and the question is? =)
[12:06:41] <SomeDude> hey sorry
[12:06:49] <SomeDude> so here's what i want to accomplish
[12:07:07] <SomeDude> i want that everytime a div with a specific attribute "xyz"
[12:07:16] <SomeDude> if found in the dom to perform a routine on it
[12:07:52] <SomeDude> so even if i add the attribute using .attr to also launch that routine on it
[12:08:34] <SomeDude> any ideas?
[12:09:05] <Couto> not yet… since DOM Mutations event is not fully implemented yet by the browsers =)
[12:09:43] <Couto> you could keep a collection of divs with that attr and every time you add that attr to a div
[12:09:52] <Couto> you add that div to the collection
[12:10:02] <SomeDude> yeah
[12:10:33] <Couto> it's not perfect but it would work
[12:10:37] <SomeDude> right
[12:10:59] <Couto> on the other hand… if that routine is based on a user action
[12:11:06] <Couto> you could just use event delegation
[12:11:24] <SomeDude> t's not
[12:11:27] <SomeDude> it's not
[12:11:52] <SomeDude> im thinking maybe a custom event on all elements with that div
[12:12:08] <SomeDude> so say .on("myEvent")
[12:12:31] <SomeDude> and when i add the attr("xyz","").trigger("myEvent")
[12:13:09] <Couto> SomeDude that would work
[12:15:18] <SomeDude> thanks Couto
[12:22:36] <SomeDude> worked like a charm
[12:36:49] <gen0cide> beachandbytes: Just woke up, trying to figure out why the bash script isnt working heh
[12:56:02] <gen0cide> works now, yes
[13:24:06] <cYmen> Is it possible to send messages from the webserver to the client or do I have to poll regularly?
[13:24:58] <ryanneufeld> cYmen: I think you can use websockets for that
[13:25:00] <johnkpaul> ?g server sent events @ cYmen
[13:25:00] <b-ot> cYmen, Server-sent events - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events
[13:25:04] <ryanneufeld> though they aren't uinversally supported
[13:25:28] <johnkpaul> you can use the "Event source api" in not-IE
[13:25:33] <johnkpaul> but I think there are polyfills
[13:25:41] <johnkpaul> or shims? I never remember
[13:26:33] <cYmen> k, thanks!

[13:29:25] <timwis> Hey guys, does anyone know if the dataTables plugin has a way I can add an attribute to each column? I'd like to add "data-row" so I can make my table responsive
[13:35:27] <Boze> is there jquery or js for running a script only once when the page loads (if they go back to the page it won't run again)?
[13:39:56] <cYmen> Hm...is it possible that SSEs don't work too well with firewalls interfering?
[13:43:47] <johnkpaul> cYmen:I don't think it's doing any HTTP fanciness like websockets
[13:44:03] <johnkpaul> but tbh, I don't know the details
[13:44:40] <johnkpaul> cYmen: you can get more info here - http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/
[13:44:57] <johnkpaul> "SSEs are sent over traditional HTTP. That means they do not require a special protocol or server implementation"
[13:47:03] <cYmen> Yeah, I was actually looking at that and asked because the sample is always "disconnected" for me. :)
[14:05:14] <phonebook_> hi, i know im notorious here and if im not i should be
[14:05:39] <phonebook_> ...just had an idea and is maybe slightly off topic but it would basically be prototyped in jquery
[14:05:56] <phonebook_> someone say go on or something
[14:06:03] <shoky> why?
[14:06:22] <phonebook_> i dont know, because life is boring and ultimately pointless
[14:06:36] <shoky> word
[14:07:02] <phonebook_> i think tablet keyboards can be drastically improved
[14:07:18] <phonebook_> easy to prototype that in jquery
[14:07:58] <phonebook_> in fact it makes me angry at humanity that they are so bad
[14:08:00] <phonebook_> #$@@#$
[14:08:26] <phonebook_> an on screen QWERTY keyboard on a tablet..... #@$@#%^
[14:08:40] <phonebook_> no on cares?
[14:08:42] <phonebook_> as usual
[14:08:48] <shoky> not one bit, really
[14:08:54] <phonebook_> awesome
[14:09:06] <phonebook_> what are you working on then that is so cool?
[14:09:17] <phonebook_> cooler than "bleeding edge" blah blah blah
[14:09:18] <tash> i'm sure I've asked this before, and for some reason I dont' remember how to do it.  I want to check the value of a <td> in a <tr> and do "X"... if 'jobfinished' has a value, hide 'jobend' in that same row.
[14:09:28] <tash> and there are several rows, so has to be an .each I'm sure.
[14:09:30] <shoky> i'm not working on anything too cool
[14:09:46] <phonebook_> tash i can help
[14:10:02] <phonebook_> does the td have any identifiers like a class or id?
[14:10:14] <tash> class
[14:10:18] <phonebook_> perfect
[14:10:21] <tash> class="jobend"
[14:10:21] <phonebook_> so..
[14:10:27] <tash> and jobfinished
[14:10:34] <phonebook_> $(".jobend")......?
[14:11:16] <tash> i want if td[class^=jobfinished] isn't null, hid the jobend in that same row
[14:11:34] <tash> or has a value, not sure 'isn't null' is the correct verbiage
[14:11:55] <shoky> it isn't, but neither is 'has a value'
[14:12:09] <shoky> say what you mean instead of what you think its called
[14:12:21] <tash> k
[14:12:38] <phonebook_> you know about .val()? var x = myElement.val(); x == "undefined"; !x
[14:12:39] <shoky> you might want the text inside the <td> for example
[14:12:53] <tash> if <td> whose class is 'jobfinished' doesn't containt a date, I want to hide the date in <td> whose class is 'jobend'
[14:13:04] <shoky> you probably dont want .val() if we're talking about a td's text
[14:13:12] <phonebook_> x !== undefined.. that logic was not meant to be perfect, just to put the ideas out there
[14:13:17] <phonebook_> .text()
[14:13:24] <phonebook_> er
[14:13:25] <phonebook_> .html
[14:13:45] <tash> yeah, I'm sure it's .html(''), I just can't remember how to do the loop logic
[14:14:08] <shoky> tash, now you're saying "doesnt contain a date" ?
[14:14:14] <phonebook_> $.each(selector, function() {  var myVar = $(this); });
[14:14:26] <shoky> so , if it contains something else and not a date?
[14:14:27] <tash> shoky: yes, the only value in it is a date
[14:14:40] <tash> sorry guys ... I didn't explain that well
[14:14:49] <phonebook_> you need to do date validation too?
[14:14:56] <tash> jobfinished will only ever have a date in it like 2012-12-25 or it will be empty
[14:14:58] <shoky> what's wrong with 'the text inside the <td>' :\
[14:15:07] <phonebook_> good
[14:15:08] <tash> if it isn't empty, hide jobend, like .html('') on jobend
[14:15:18] <phonebook_> so step 1 is get the value of job finished. can you do that?
[14:15:22] <tash> this is what I attempted before asking for help http://pastie.org/4692194
[14:15:37] <tash> which I'm sure is all kinds of jacked up
[14:15:45] <tash> was taking a stab at it w/o asking for help though.
[14:16:41] <phonebook_> ah
[14:16:47] <phonebook_> you want .length == 0
[14:16:50] <phonebook_> or
[14:17:01] <phonebook_> ...yeah just use taht
[14:17:11] <phonebook_> you could be super cool but == 0 is best
[14:17:17] <shoky> $('td.jobfinished:empty').siblings('td.jobend').empty()
[14:17:33] <phonebook_> if( $(this).find( 'td[class^=jobfinished]' ) > 0 )
[14:17:43] <phonebook_> .length
[14:17:44] <phonebook_> fuck
[14:17:49] <phonebook_> this is why people hate me
[14:18:04] <phonebook_> if( $(this).find( 'td[class^=jobfinished]' ).length > 0 )
[14:19:46] <tash> still not working, but not sure why ... no errors in firebug, gonna have to do some debugging.
[14:19:56] <shoky> tash pastebin some html..
[14:20:04] <shoky> better yet a fiddle
[14:20:05] <tash> k
[14:20:14] <phonebook_> or put it in jsfiddle and we can figure it out in two seconds
[14:24:53] <phonebook_> ^to be fair people hate me because i usually end up getting realy drunk and telling everyone how i feel
[14:25:21] <phonebook_> i do have a cool idea though
[14:25:23] <shoky> at least now you're only telling others how they feel.
[14:25:32] <phonebook_> exactly
[14:26:06] <tash> making a fiddle now, which is pissing me off, b/c it looks like it is working in the fiddle
[14:26:15] <phonebook_> ahha hhaa HAAA
[14:26:28] <tash> wtf
[14:26:45] <tash> I only put 1 row in the fiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/E3wMX/
[14:26:48] <phonebook_> sry, was trying to be funny
[14:26:56] <tash> it seems to be working in the fiddle
[14:27:03] <tash> not sure why it isn't in my app though.
[14:28:24] <phonebook_> thats exactly how it should be
[14:28:37] <phonebook_> 100%correct
[14:28:51] <tash> yeah, working in fiddle not in my app? :D
[14:28:57] <tash> exactly how it should be huh? hahaha
[14:29:01] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/E3wMX/1/
[14:29:58] <tash> shoky: tried that too, not working in my app, hmm
[14:30:02] <tash> I better check cache
[14:30:32] <tash> still no dice
[14:30:33] <tash> hrm
[14:31:04] <phonebook_> whats not happening that should be happening?
[14:31:33] <tash> the jobend value ( which happesn to be a date like 2012-08-27 ) is still showing up on the page.
[14:31:38] <phonebook_> a lot of times i will put a border around the thing i am trying to access. like .css("border", "1px solid Red") to make sure its working right
[14:31:39] <tash> I want it to be hidden
[14:32:52] <shoky> tash: break it down
[14:33:02] <tash> i would, but I don't have a mic
[14:33:04] <shoky> first run the first part   $('#search-results-table td.jobfinished:empty')
[14:33:21] <shoky> see what that returns, (console.log it or its length, whatever)
[14:34:06] <shoky> or even first run $('#search-results-table')
[14:34:25] <shoky> debug that shit, step by step
[14:35:14] <tw2113> delouse it while you're at it
[14:35:18] <tw2113> oops, wrong topic
[14:36:11] <shoky> relevant. code's full of lice
[14:36:46] <shoky> strings are slowly being consumed
[14:39:59] <tash> i got it
[14:40:02] <tash> i'm a dumbass
[14:40:30] <tash> forgot that i changed some code, using DataTables, so my table is doing all this async stuff
[14:40:39] <tash> just did the check on success in all that jazz and works now.
[14:41:15] <phonebook_> i have this http://jsfiddle.net/E3wMX/8/
[14:41:23] <phonebook_> you have probably already solved the problem 10 times
[14:41:45] <tash> yep, with other things
[14:41:51] <tash> I looked at it and said 'duh'
[14:41:53] <tash> psh
[14:42:17] <phonebook_> none of us make enough money. thats the one thing we can be sure of
[14:42:33] <tw2113> what's money?
[14:42:42] <shoky> i cant even pronounce it
[14:42:42] <tw2113> oh you mean Romney's toilet paper
[14:43:02] <phonebook_> you use it to get monitors and tablets
[14:43:06] <shoky> what's toilet paper?
[14:44:14] <phonebook_> hold on
[14:44:20] <phonebook_> i can make my js fiddle better
[14:44:58] <shoky> phonebook_: he wanted the <td> to be empty, not to be non-existent
[14:45:38] <shoky> the .jobfinished one, that is
[14:47:12] <shoky> actually, who knows
[14:53:48] <phonebook_> ah perfect
[14:53:50] <phonebook_> http://jsfiddle.net/E3wMX/10/
[14:54:33] <phonebook_> wait...

[14:57:51] <phonebook_> where did everyone go?
[15:00:40] <xboi209> yo
[15:00:47] <xboi209> how do i check if an option is selected?
[15:01:20] <phonebook_> :selected
[15:01:21] <phonebook_> or
[15:01:34] <phonebook_> :not(:selected)
[15:01:44] <phonebook_> if its already a jqm object
[15:02:29] <phonebook_> something like .has(":selected") or .filter(":selected)......  there
[15:02:41] <xboi209> ok
[15:03:33] <phonebook_> better answers here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/149573/check-if-option-is-selected-with-jquery-if-not-select-a-default
[15:03:53] <phonebook_> why just ok?
[15:03:59] <phonebook_> ok like thanks man
[15:04:28] <phonebook_> or okay like i have no respect for you but sort of dont want you to feel bad because i dont agree and my opinion somehow matters
[15:14:17] <phonebook_> so the ok where i ask an extremely basic question about jquery on then get an answer i dont like from someone who doesnt respect me because if i actually cared i would easily know but then i say ok
[15:14:28] <phonebook_> irc..... all 5000 ppl in here
[15:14:30] <phonebook_> youre the best
[15:21:17] <odigity> I just learned jquery and jquery-ui today.  I hate Microsoft, but their video series was the best intro I found (went through several): http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Javascript-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners
[15:21:43] <odigity> I also watched the jquery conf keynotes from the last few years where they talk about 1.9-1.11.  I see that 1.9 beta 1 was released a few weeks ago
[15:22:06] <odigity> so, since I'm starting now for the first time, should I start with 1.9 beta 1 so I don't have to learn APIs later?  or should I still go for 1.8?
[15:22:42] <odigity> one concern is that I'm learning Ember.js right now with Ember-1.0-pre, which depends on jquery 1.7.2, which is not compatible with jquery 1.9 beta, so I might have to stick with jquery ui 1.8.23 for now
[15:35:57] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:48:30] <arielser_> odigity: stick to 1.8
[15:56:46] <odigity> arielser_: ok
[16:18:55] <L1> I have a $get request, which just sin't firing.   http://pastebin.com/tdZUEmmj    Pretty standard, but in my browsers network tab I see no requests made. Any clues as to tracking down the issue?
[16:20:32] <L1> Ah got it. Bad copy pasting, has {} wrapping everything
[16:20:34] <vladikoff> L1, are you sure the click event works?
[16:20:42] <vladikoff> L1, cool!
[16:42:57] <voidet> Hi there, wondering how to use the $().on() function with multiple selectors in the selector param
[16:53:06] <coldhead> voidet: $(document).on('click', 'a,input,img', ...) ?
[16:54:05] <voidet> thanks coldhead
[17:15:13] <nayers1981> Hey all i am a noob at programming and have a question about using jquery. I want to be able to click on my link within my nav bar and it pull information from another page on my server grabbing the information from a div tag. is there anyone that would be willing to try and help me?
[17:16:17] <coldhead> do you know how to do a click handler, nayers1981 ?
[17:16:45] <nayers1981> .click()
[17:16:58] <coldhead> okay so inside your click handler
[17:17:03] <coldhead> you want to use ?ajax
[17:17:08] <nayers1981> yes
[17:17:17] <coldhead> bot is broked >: |
[17:19:41] <coldhead> nayers1981: http://jsfiddle.net/pDJvY/
[17:19:53] <coldhead> that's a surprisingly simple example which works
[17:20:06] <coldhead> it loads jsfiddle.com and replaces the div
[17:20:08] <coldhead> with #info
[17:20:43] <nayers1981> wow thanks i believe i can use that
[17:21:54] <coldhead> check the docs for how load() works if you need to do anything fanicer
[17:22:27] <coldhead> good luck, nayers1981
[17:23:01] <nayers1981> thank you that helps alot i ll try it now see if itll work how i need it to.
[17:33:41] <howardgrigg> hey guys I'm wanting to form a bookmarklet which has a serialized array as part of it but I'm unsure how to precede - this is what I've got http://pastie.org/4692977
[17:48:05] <scar> Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Window] is not a function
[17:48:13] <scar> but im using $(document).ready(function() { });
[17:48:16] <scar> lol
[18:06:19] <azbyin> hi all..
[18:07:23] <azbyin> in $(document).ready(function() { ... }); is it guaranteed that all scripts (instantiated by <script>) have been loaded ?
[18:09:12] <azbyin> i.e.  <script type="text/javascript"> $(document).ready(function(){ //callmyfunc;  myfunc(); }); </script> <script src="dodo.js_containing_myfunc"></script>
[18:14:14] <coldhead> no azbyin
[18:14:25] <coldhead> it means the document is ready
[18:14:35] <coldhead> <body> has been parsed
[18:14:39] <coldhead> some scripts take forever
[18:17:46] <azbyin> umm.. ok. but if my other script(that is instantiated in a script tag at the bottom of body) does nothing other than define myfunc() it should be available in $(document).ready, right?
[18:18:21] <coldhead> not necessarily
[18:18:35] <coldhead> you want load() instead of ready()
[18:18:36] <coldhead> perhaps
[18:19:43] <azbyin> umm.. isn't js parsed in order? i.e. whatever scripts appear before are parsed earlier than later ones, right?
[18:20:18] <azbyin> so i can simply make sure i put the document.ready() in a later script and be sure that the earlier script has made myfunc() available, correct?
[18:22:29] <elguapo99> I am just learning jquery.  looking for example where I have buttons that make a <div> slide like in an iPHONE app.
[18:22:35] <elguapo99> any sugestions?
[18:23:14] <coldhead> yes that sounds right, azbyin
[18:38:42] <nayers1981> I wasnt able to get it to work. Here is what im starting with... http://pastie.org/4693170 and i would like to be able to click on one of the links in the nav bar and it display the content from a div on a second page such as test.html thats on my server. i cannot get the code to show just the contents from the div ..
[18:41:07] <coldhead> nayers1981: did you see in my example how i added a selector after the url?
[18:41:39] <coldhead> so if you want the #other div you would say $('.some_target').load('/test.html #other')
[19:25:38] <fruitFly> hey :).. I'm new.. how can I search the jquery functions for the effects I want?
[19:26:38] <fruitFly>  hey :).. I'm new.. how can I search the jquery functions for the effects I want?
[19:26:53] <arielserafini> fruitFly:  http://api.jquery.com/
[19:27:15] <fruitFly> Thanks!
[19:32:32] <fruitFly> I didn't have much programming stimuli when younger and I was peer pressured into becoming an engineer, about 5 years later I quit my job and just want to learn programming. I just want to meet some like minded people and am curious as to what technical interests others have
[19:32:59] <ericelliott> fruitFly: where do you live?
[19:33:24] <ericelliott> fruitFly: http://html5devconf.com/
[19:33:30] <fruitFly> I'm from Jamaica but am in greenbay right now
[19:35:48] <fruitFly> looks really interesting.. do you have to pay?
[20:31:47] <offlim> can someone guide me in the right direction im using ajax for my form and im trying to get the php response for a specific $_POST php throws back and put it in jquery http://codepad.org/L087W44p
[20:32:34] <offlim> now everything works on it but when i log data everything in the php file is returned instead of targetting a specific post value
[20:33:04] <offlim> i tried data.email but that didnt work, i kinda knew it was a little too easy for that to work...
[20:59:47] <digs> Is there anyway to know if a user arrived at a page with the back button or not?
[20:59:58] <ai__> im loading a form from my menu using ajax.. when i fill in the form and i save it dissapears.. why is that happening?
[21:00:30] <digs> What the action of the form and what is the code responding to the action?
[21:02:19] <ai__> digs:  look http://pastebin.com/Tg4DJR6V
[21:03:20] <digs> Wait, why are you adding a form to the page through an AJAX call?
[21:03:31] <digs> Is the form dynamically built?
[21:03:40] <ai__> because i have a menu
[21:03:54] <ai__> when i click in the menu i need to show the page with the form
[21:04:05] <ai__> i mean when i click the link
[21:04:26] <digs> I am sorry, but I don't see why you need an AJAX call to do that.
[21:04:44] <digs> It should be in a hidden div and just .show();
[21:04:54] <digs> Or, just go to that page.
[21:05:37] <ai__> going to the page means it will be reload it
[21:05:42] <digs> Also, you code doesn't show me the answer to the question I asked. I need to see the contents of add_employees.php
[21:05:50] <digs> your*
[21:07:26] <ai__> digs:  what i meant is that i need to show the form next to the menu i dont want to be linked to the page.. just show the form in the same page
[21:08:58] <offlim> can someone guide me in the right direction im using ajax for my form and im trying to get the php response for a specific $_POST php throws back and put it in jquery http://codepad.org/L087W44p
[21:17:38] <digs> He never did show me the right code :/
[21:17:42] <digs> Ahh well.
[21:18:00] <jcp_> what's a good way to draw lines between multiple divs?
[21:18:09] <digs> bordres.
[21:18:15] <digs> borders even.
[21:30:12] <oojacoboo> zomg firefox's scratchpad
[21:32:01] <tw2113> i love it
[21:32:26] <tw2113> handy for quick jquery stuff when it's too inefficient to make fiddles
[21:32:37] <oojacoboo> tw2113, better than that
[21:32:56] <oojacoboo> trying out new code on your site so you don't have to refresh the browser
[21:33:33] <oojacoboo> I just want to see inline editing of the js source, then the ability to rerun the js
[21:58:07] <funny200012> helo
[22:06:44] <dtr> test
[22:09:43] <coldhead> http://twitter.com/_iAmCrack/status/244898854829428736
[22:22:43] <AlexWaters> coldhead: nice. that guy's inspirational
[22:22:54] <AlexWaters> coldhead: what are you working on?
[22:24:11] <ibodi> what is the % of sites not supported js ?
[22:28:31] <coldhead> AlexWaters: a lame mobile site
[22:38:25] <oojacoboo> firefox's js engine just doesn't compete with chrome :/
[22:38:30] <oojacoboo> the rendering is good though
[22:38:49] <oojacoboo> I've been on Chrome for about 1.5 years from using Firefox before
[22:38:57] <AlexWaters> just got my jquery form written. feels good
[22:39:00] <oojacoboo> testing out FF again… the js is lacking
[22:45:21] <fruitFly> in js how can I instantiate an array with it's name coming from another function
[22:46:17] <oojacoboo> fruitFly, return a string of the name
[22:46:25] <fruitFly> Thanks
[22:46:35] <fruitFly> I figured but just wanted to make sure.
[22:46:47] <fruitFly> so variable name types are strings then
[22:46:59] <oojacoboo> ?
[22:47:13] <oojacoboo> the function would just return the string so you'd know
[22:47:21] <oojacoboo> then you'd create an array with that string
[22:47:53] <oojacoboo> fruitFly, why not just return the array?
[22:48:42] <fruitFly> ahh.. I get you oojac
[22:49:40] <fruitFly> what I'm trying to do is put arrays in an an array.. like in the array log I'll create array1, array2, array3... whenever something prompts it's creation
[22:50:17] <oojacoboo> so return an array, assign that as a var, and put that within an array in your function
[22:51:15] <fruitFly> I will try
[22:51:26] <fruitFly> you gonna be around ooj?
[22:51:38] <oojacoboo> not a whole lot longer
[22:52:40] <fruitFly> :(
[22:54:01] <libin> hello everyone. how do i disable zoom on header and footer in a jquery mobile app?
[22:54:39] <oojacoboo> this isn't jquery mobile
[22:55:30] <libin> i thought someone will know it since its a jquery forum. It is related
[22:55:56] <morficus> try #jquerymobile
[22:56:00] <oojacoboo> libin, looks like you found it already
[22:56:26] <libin> yes. i did. thanks
[23:23:35] <modn> Hey guys
[23:23:51] <modn> has anyone used the fastclick for mobile?
[23:25:18] <modn> sorry not fastclick, i meant fastbutton
[23:42:23] <Ayush> I want to add global event to jQuery Dialog when they will create ... how can i do ?
[23:44:09] <Admax81> you can bind event with live function
[23:44:28] <Ayush> yah but i want to add one event to all dialog which will create on future..
[23:44:30] <Ayush> at once..
[23:44:37] <Ayush> so no need to add again n again.
[23:45:39] <DobreJoe> hi, if I hide the first child in a collection of divs the first child just disappears?
[23:45:43] <Admax81> $(".selector").live("click",function(){//this code was work and for new created elements});
[23:46:06] <Ayush> but i just want to add that event only when dialogs open..
[23:46:07] <Ayush> :/
[23:46:27] <coldhead> i don't understand, DobreJoe: "when i do a thing then that thing happens?"?
[23:46:35] <Ayush> when ever any dialog opens i want to run the code..
[23:47:36] <Admax81> if so, u must edit dialog script. u can't add js code after page is loaded
[23:49:21] <DobreJoe> coldhead, with a click I'm doing $('span.entry:first-child').hide(); but the following clicks don't remove the, my guess, next new first-child.
[23:49:42] <DobreJoe> maybe first:visible
[23:50:04] <coldhead> ah, yes i see what you mean
[23:50:09] <coldhead> hide just sets display: none;
[23:50:11] <coldhead> it's still in the dom
[23:50:20] <coldhead> it still counts as the first-child
[23:50:43] <coldhead> i would probably try $('...:visible').first();
[23:52:50] <DobreJoe> thanks, trying with :fisible.first();
[23:52:52] <Ayush> I got the way to do that : $('.ui-dialog').live('dialogopen',function() { 	alert('hello world');	 });
[23:53:33] <Admax81> :D
[23:53:57] <Ayush> Thankx .
