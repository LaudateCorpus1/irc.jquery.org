[02:13:20] <hellyeah> hey anyone around?
[02:44:45] <Qria> Hi, I have a div tag listening for click event but jQuery.click() does not trigger it. Do they refer to different events?
[02:56:49] <Cork> Qria: $('div').click looks up the existing divs and binds click events to them
[02:56:58] <Cork> it won't catch events for events that you add later
[02:57:04] <Cork> you need delegation for that
[02:57:52] <Qria> I'm sure I called .click after everything loaded, because I did it on chrome devtools console
[02:58:25] <Cork> Qria: well the page might replace the element with a new element with the same content
[02:58:30] <Cork> it is still considered a new element
[02:58:46] <Cork> ex. $('parent-selector').html(newHTML)
[02:59:16] <hellyeah> may i ask algorithmic question here?
[02:59:28] <Qria> can jquery trigger events not bound by jquery?
[02:59:44] <Cork> yes
[03:00:24] <Cork> uh
[03:00:49] <Cork> btw just to be sure you are talking about .trigger('click') or .click() right?
[03:00:59] <Qria> yes
[03:01:13] <Cork> ya it runs the elms .click() function as the last action
[03:01:29] <Cork> so it should fire the none jquery event handlers
[03:03:12] <Qria> What if the element doesn't have a .click() ? I inspected the element with dir() and it did not have .click()
[03:03:23] <Qria> but still the chrome devtools says it listens to 'click' event
[03:03:41] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click
[03:03:46] <Cork> all elements do
[03:04:51] <Qria> Huh, but it doesn't do anything when I do: jQuery('#gt-src-listen')[0].click()
[03:05:07] <Qria> now it became a javascript problem, hmmm :/
[03:07:17] <Cork> Qria: https://jsfiddle.net/f67qcxhx/
[03:07:51] <Cork> Qria: make sure you don't for example have multiple elements with the same id
[03:08:17] <Cork> $('[id="gt-src-listen"]').length === 1
[03:08:24] <Cork> if length > 1 you have a problem
[03:08:30] <Cork> if it is 0 the element isn't found
[03:10:08] <Qria> jQuery('#gt-src-listen').length === 1 // returns true
[03:10:18] <Cork> [id=""] not #
[03:10:24] <Cork> # always only returns one match
[03:10:40] <Cork> as your making an id lookup and by definition it can only ever be one at most
[03:10:58] <Qria> jQuery('[id=gt-src-listen]').length === 1 // still true
[03:10:58] <Cork> (so if you have multiple only one of them is ever found)
[03:11:02] <Cork> ok
[03:11:15] <Cork> then i don't know why it isn't working for you
[03:11:23] <Qria> :'(
[03:11:27] <Cork> as you see in the jsfiddle it works
[03:11:36] <Cork> you could try reproducing the problem in a fiddle
[03:11:53] <Qria> Can i embed a website in fiddle?
[03:11:57] <hase091> hello, is there a problem with the demos of https://jqueryui.com/ ? it didn't work for me in firefox and chrome today. sorry for my english
[03:12:15] <Qria> because what I'm trying to do is click a button in a website
[03:12:58] <Cork> hase091: yup
[03:13:09] <Cork> i'll ping the infrastructure
[03:13:55] <hase091> ok, thanks Cork.
[03:14:52] <Cork> hase091: bootstrap.js has apparently gone bye bye
[03:14:57] <Cork> https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/draggable/default.html
[03:15:11] <hase091> i see
[03:15:57] <hase091> should i need to open a topic on the forum?
[03:16:26] <Cork> na, like i said i've pinged the infrastructure guys
[03:17:01] <Cork> most of them live in the us though, so might take a while
[03:17:38] <hase091> ok, np
[03:17:56] <Cork> hase091: you could just view source and run that in jsfiddle though
[03:18:41] <hase091> yea sure, thanks! :)
[03:46:28] <dasd32> Hi there, would it be wiser to store 6 vars about a single element in seperate vars, or simply in its own object?
[03:46:46] <Gridsurf> Anything wrong with jQuery UI website? None of the demos showcasing the UI thingies are working for me in at the moment.
[03:47:16] <dasd32> var tt1 = 1, tt2 = 2, tt3 = 3, tt4 = 4; or var ttObj = {...};
[03:58:58] <Cork> dasd32: normally an object is easier to read
[03:59:24] <Cork> if you create it a lot of times objects cause more gc though
[04:24:40] <cannap> jQuery.Deferred is now Promises/A+ compatible
[04:35:03] <QssT> How do I populate a textboxt field with value on selecting the field?
[04:38:09] <QssT> ##javascript
[04:52:46] <Cork> QssT: you mean you want to append to it?
[04:53:18] <Cork> else just $('input').on('focus', function() { $(this).val('something') });
[06:28:21] <hellyeah> i know it is simpple question but i gotta ask
[06:29:00] <hellyeah> in line 16 why i cannot get value of input box .from you create and you pick value then you click create http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/573/
[06:32:41] <hellyeah> humm
[07:34:29] <multi_io> https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[07:35:01] <multi_io> anyone familiar with this thing? I see no API or anything for setting the available and chosen options dynamically.
[07:36:09] <multi_io> oh, I guess you have to trigger that event
[07:43:46] <misterpilou> Hi everyone, i want to calculate the interval beetween to height in a column, for that i did that piece of code : https://jsfiddle.net/jxc319t8/ but when i test it with debugger, the a parameter is set to toRad and the b is set at function(). Can Someone help me?
[07:46:53] <misterpilou> Hi everyone, i want to calculate the interval beetween two heights in a column, for that i did that piece of code : https://jsfiddle.net/jxc319t8/ but when i test it with debugger, the a parameter is set to toRad and the b is set to function(). Can Someone help me?
[07:50:15] <multi_io> is there a way to create an HTML element from a structured JS object?
[07:51:08] <hellyeah> append iit to body?
[07:51:09] <multi_io> e.g. from ['div', {id:'foo", style:"width:100px"}] or something like that
[07:51:30] <multi_io> so you don't have to do all the quoting yourself
[07:52:45] <misterpilou>  Hi everyone, i want to calculate the interval beetween two heights in a column, for that i did that piece of code : https://jsfiddle.net/jxc319t8/ but when i test it with debugger, the a parameter is set to toRad and the b is set to function(). Can Someone help me?
[07:55:01] <hellyeah> anypmne knopw jquery datepicker?
[07:56:24] <multi_io> i.e. something like https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.10/dojo/dom-construct.html#dojo-dom-construct-create
[08:01:40] <multi_io> using sth like $('select').append($('<option/>').val(5).text('lala')) now, good enough I guess
[08:20:17] <cannap> is jquery 3 now more modular? can i use import $,{somemodule} from 'jquery' ?
[08:20:33] <hellyeah> from.push(clone.find('.from').val().replace('-',''));
[08:20:44] <hellyeah> what do i need to add for make this recursive?
[08:29:16] <cannap> hellyea each?
[08:29:21] <cannap> @hellyeah
[08:30:15] <hellyeah> each
[08:30:16] <hellyeah> ?
[08:30:33] <hellyeah> cannap: pls check line 18 how can i make replace method recursive http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/580/
[08:33:42] <cannap> why are you replace
[08:33:44] <cannap> this?
[08:34:18] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:34:28] <hellyeah> because in datepicker there is mindate thing
[08:34:34] <hellyeah> and it get number
[08:34:48] <hellyeah> i will do to - from to get a number
[08:35:11] <hellyeah> and i use date number for example minDate: - (to - from)
[08:35:21] <cannap> no plan sry
[08:35:24] <hellyeah> so i will bve able to disable dates in "to"
[08:35:30] <hellyeah> plan?
[08:35:34] <hellyeah> what do you mean?
[08:38:23] <cannap> no idea
[08:48:00] <worknick> how can i implement infinite scrolling in a fixed height div?
[08:48:34] <Cork> worknick: check the scrollTop and scrollHeight in the element
[08:48:37] <Cork> on scroll event
[08:48:47] <Cork> when you gex x px from the max of the scrollHeight
[08:48:51] <Cork> pull more data
[08:48:59] <worknick> ok.
[09:16:30] <Mark__> can anyone help me with the mouseleave event on this particular case? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34810509/how-can-i-remove-the-class-when-the-mouse-is-out-of-the-main-menu/34810929#34810929
[09:32:00] <iamcenz> hello
[09:32:26] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/n3ns2f44/1/
[09:32:35] <Kartagis> Mark__: I updated it
[09:43:00] <iamcenz> hey can anyone help me out with something thats prolly really simple but i just cant seem to figure out.
[09:43:19] <hellyeah> did you fiddle it?
[09:43:25] <iamcenz> yes i did
[09:43:53] <hellyeah> where is it? i didnt see it
[09:44:02] <hellyeah> i am not expert but i may help you
[09:44:27] <iamcenz> https://jsfiddle.net/iamcenz/54b1rg2x/ i cant seem to figure out if i hover over another event to close the orginal instantly and not delay a fade out.
[09:45:10] <iamcenz> you might have to move the windows around to get it to desktop mode.
[09:46:29] <taplar> you don't want the delay?
[09:46:47] <iamcenz> i do if you move off the menu all together
[09:47:05] <iamcenz> but if you go from account to search i dont
[09:47:10] <Cork> iamcenz: i would recommend to use mouseenter/leave instead
[09:47:19] <Cork> and delegate it to the navbar
[09:47:50] <Cork> finally you can check if the new target is a nav-popup and skip the animation if it is
[09:48:36] <Cork> iamcenz: actually an even simpler solution is to add the hide for mouseleave from the bar
[09:48:56] <Cork> and do fadein unless the bar has a "hovering"
[09:49:17] <iamcenz> would you mind showing me an example, because im not getting what you mean.
[09:49:21] <Cork> and a hide "all" and show the next when you move from one to the next
[09:49:32] <Cork> sadly i don't have time to code it
[09:49:35] <iamcenz> ok
[09:50:07] <iamcenz> ill try to figure out what you mean.
[09:50:42] <Cork> but $('.navbar-header').on('mouseleave', function() { $(this).addClass('hovering'); $('.popups').fadeout(); }).on('mouseenter', function() { $(this).removeClass('hovering'); });
[09:50:59] <Cork> that should clean up the popups and mark the bar when entering
[09:51:21] <Cork> the rest is a .on('mouseenter', '.nav-popup', function() {});
[09:51:31] * Cork runs back to what he should do
[09:52:43] <iamcenz> ok ill see what i can do, thanks alot Cork
[10:08:13] <hellyeah> anyone know about jquery datepicker
[10:08:14] <hellyeah> ?
[10:10:45] <ExtraSteve> hellyeah: as they say - don't ask to ask, just ask

[10:11:55] <hellyeah> pls check line 32 i try to disable dates in "to" i got the dates value from "from" and "to" then do some operation but it doesnt work. Can you help me to figure out why http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/586/
[10:12:58] <hellyeah> probably from and to array are empty but i have to pass the value to mindate

[10:29:48] <yanchai> hi guys
[10:30:02] <yanchai> anyone here know jquery for mobile nav menu?
[10:30:38] <taplar> hellyeah: ok, broke it up into some functions so it's a little more readable.  http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/592/
[10:31:18] <taplar> hellyeah: so on line 37 we're getting the last datepicker
[10:33:04] <hellyeah> ic
[10:33:11] <hellyeah> thanks for clearing it up
[10:33:17] <taplar> so what do you want to do with that last one
[10:33:20] <hellyeah> but disabled functionality didnt work
[10:33:26] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:33:36] <taplar> i didn't fix it.  i just cleaned it up a bit
[10:33:45] <hellyeah> if last one is not empty
[10:33:55] <hellyeah> then  when you create new one
[10:34:00] <hellyeah> disable pervious
[10:34:30] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:34:36] <hellyeah> it is almost off time for work
[10:34:42] <hellyeah> i will join here
[10:34:47] <hellyeah> after 2 hours
[10:34:56] <hellyeah> can we continue?
[10:35:07] <taplar> i may be gaming.  we'll see, :)
[10:35:18] <hellyeah> which game?
[10:35:21] <taplar> ddo
[10:35:44] <hellyeah> dungeons and dragons
[10:35:45] <hellyeah> okey
[10:35:47] <taplar> yeah
[10:35:59] <hellyeah> thank you for helping me out
[10:36:11] <taplar> np, before you go incase i am out i wanted to mention
[10:36:13] <hellyeah> i always apprciated your help
[10:36:20] <taplar> look at your click binding
[10:36:25] <hellyeah> hmm i am reading
[10:36:42] <taplar> we're calling the disable method before the method that creates the next new datepickers
[10:36:56] <taplar> so the last one we get in the disable function will be the one you want to conditionally disable
[10:36:56] <hellyeah> line 50
[10:36:57] <hellyeah> ?
[10:37:24] <hellyeah> hmm okeyt
[10:37:29] <hellyeah> basically you mean
[10:37:37] <hellyeah> call this function in if and else
[10:37:42] <taplar> no
[10:38:16] <taplar> i'm saying the last datepicker we find on line 37, after the click handler has completed, it will be the next to last datepicker
[10:38:37] <taplar> so if you were possibly thinking that you might need to do a prev() you don't
[10:38:42] <hellyeah> prev()
[10:38:45] <taplar> you just need to do your evaluation
[10:39:06] <hellyeah> okey thanks
[10:39:20] <hellyeah> i may see today evening
[10:39:53] * taplar thinks it's time to kills some dump ai enemies
[10:40:03] * taplar can't spell
[10:52:36] <jquery852> I am unable to capture form submission in js. When I press submit, I receive the form element, but the textarea tag is empty. Here's my simple html + js code: http://dpaste.com/35DSEGJ Any idea what mistake I am doing?
[10:54:16] <taplar> fwiw, do your binding with on() instead of inline'ed in the markup
[10:54:39] <jquery852> taplar: was that to me?
[10:54:48] <taplar> and from that snipplet 'replyBox' looks like it's the form so it'd be like $(replyBox).find('textarea').val()
[10:54:52] <taplar> yep
[10:55:44] <jquery852> taplar: is it wrong to bind on onsubmit of form attribute?
[10:56:16] <taplar> inline bindings have limitations to them.  also, from a decoupling standpoint your mixing your logic in with your markup which isn't ideal
[10:58:12] <jquery852> taplar: all the examples I checked requires binding a form with ID. Thing is, my HTML will have multiple forms (I am trying to implement nested comments like reddit) So I added event based on the classes, but it isn't capturing. The function doesn't get called at all
[10:59:20] <taplar> you can bind using any manner, so long as you can lookup the target form.  it can be id, or class, or tag name, or another attribute (not ideal)
[11:01:09] <jquery852> taplar: is there anyway to prevent submit action, when I use `onsubmit`
[11:01:35] <taplar> you can pass in the event and do e.preventDefault() on it.  or optionally return false
[11:01:50] <taplar> preventDefault() is preferred
[11:02:08] <jquery852> taplar: I will look into passing the event. Thanks!
[11:06:44] <jquery852> taplar: can you tell me what mistake I am making here? I think the event is not getting registered - http://dpaste.com/219JP4F
[11:07:45] <taplar> your not getting the alert?
[11:08:23] <jquery852> taplar: no. is it because I have added some js functions before and then document.ready?
[11:08:38] <taplar> nah.  check your console.  see if you have an errors
[11:09:04] <jquery852> no errors
[11:09:12] <jquery852> and server also not getting any hits
[11:10:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/fjstyazv/  you got something else going on
[11:11:17] <taplar> does your form exist already when the page loads?  or is it being created dynamically?
[11:11:35] <jquery852> taplar: sorry, server is getting hits, but event is not being captured
[11:12:46] <jquery852> taplar: oh yes you are right. . it does not exist when page is loaded. I am adding it dynamically. Basically I have form in string and I use `after` a div. I think this is the issue. Anyway i can add the event also
[11:13:05] <taplar> :)
[11:13:28] <jquery852> sorry, I meant, is there anyway I can add event also?
[11:13:40] <taplar> bind after you add the form to the page
[11:14:15] <jquery852> okay trying with bind, http://api.jquery.com/bind/ *fingers taped*
[11:14:28] <taplar> oh, use on() instead
[11:14:47] <taplar> $(selector).on('submit', function(e){ /* do stuff */ });
[11:20:05] <taplar> woah
[11:20:15] <taplar> heh
[11:22:12] <jquery852> lol
[11:28:30] <arup_r> Is there any hidden convention to preced `$` before variable name in JS ?
[11:28:43] <arup_r> or it is a simply a variable ?
[11:29:16] <taplar> most people preceed a variable name with $ to denote it is a jquery variable
[11:29:27] <taplar> so they know later they don't have to $() it
[11:29:39] <taplar> but that's all itis
[11:29:43] <jeko> Howdy folks, I know this is a shot in the dark to get help, but I'm using jquery, webpack, and a slew of other tools on a large multipage ecommerce site, and I'm having trouble knowing a good place to look for help with requirements like mine. I figured some of the great people here might be able to point me in the right direction.
[11:31:03] <taplar> arup_r: but there are also chases were people just do it as they have a php brackround, so it's comfortable to them
[11:31:19] <arup_r> oh I see.. thanks taplar
[11:31:35] <taplar> *cases
[11:33:26] <taplar> jeko: what do you mean by help with requirements?
[11:33:59] <roger_padactor_> $('#id input:checkbox).each(function(){ $(this).prop('checked') })  but all its printing is an array of checkboxes in the console, I dont get why.
[11:34:22] <jeko> taplar: I'm having a hard time finding resources for webpack and jquery users
[11:34:38] <jeko> most of it is for angular and react stuff
[11:34:42] <jeko> SPAs
[11:35:21] <taplar> by resources do you mean people or...?  are you looking for help solving a problem, or are you looking for people who you can hire to solve it?
[11:36:18] <taplar> roger_padactor_: what are you trying to do?  that's statement should be printing anything
[11:36:27] <taplar> *shouldn't
[11:36:32] <jeko> solving problems, best practices, maybe people to hire to consult
[11:36:41] <roger_padactor_> i was expecting it to print out false false false false
[11:37:01] <taplar> roger_padactor_: your just referencing it.  if you want it to print out you need to console.log() it
[11:37:10] <roger_padactor_> ah
[11:37:11] <roger_padactor_> ok
[11:37:14] <taplar> console.log(this.checked)
[11:37:17] <taplar> no need to wrap it
[11:37:47] <roger_padactor_> im in the console testing it out thats why i didn't think I had to do a console.log again
[11:38:16] <taplar> jeko: well this room is all about asking jquery related questions so feel free to ask and anyone who knows can pipe in if they are available and know what your asking.  there is a #react or #reactjs room you might try for questions related to that
[11:38:41] <taplar> as far as hiring peeps, i think, don't hold me to it, there is a #freelance or #freelancer room
[11:38:45] <taplar> you might give a shot
[11:39:30] <taplar> probably an angularjs room too
[11:41:37] <jeko> yeah thanks taplar, I'm not looking for react
[11:42:05] <jeko> or angular though
[11:42:14] <jeko> jquery with webpack
[11:42:17] <taplar> oh, lol, sorry for some reason i substituted react for webpack
[11:42:20] <jeko> if anyone is doing it
[11:43:06] <jeko> seems everyone using webpack is using angular or react
[11:43:07] <Es0teric> how do i move one div container to a different location in the dom?
[11:43:23] <taplar> you can just append it to the new location
[11:43:39] <jeko> I'm looking for old skool jquery users that are leveraging the awesomeness of webpack
[11:44:27] <jeko> Es0teric: clone() the one you want to move and append() it where you want
[11:44:37] <taplar> ah, well you might try a little later.  there are some guys that come on a little later that are more front end guys than i am
[11:44:42] <jeko> remove() it frome where it was
[11:44:49] <taplar> no, just append it
[11:44:51] <jeko> okay thanks
[11:44:55] <taplar> jquery will detach it
[11:45:00] <taplar> a dom element can only have one parent
[11:45:21] <jquery852> taplar: I got the event to trigger. But I am not able to access the data in `textarea`. I attached `$this` of form to the event handler, but it is still empty. Here is my code: http://dpaste.com/3W9333X and the  document.formdata is empty when I check in console.
[11:45:59] <jquery852> sorry, I meant, textarea in `document.formdata` is empty
[11:46:12] <taplar> what is 'replyBoxForm'?
[11:47:11] <jquery852> taplar: its the form div
[11:47:16] <taplar> a fiddle showing the issue would be nice.  it's hard to see the context of your issue with this paste
[11:47:31] <jquery852> taplar: sorry, let me show you the code
[11:57:47] <jquery852> taplar: I am unable to reproduce it on JSFiddle. thing is I am generating dynamically from django and I am not able to figure out how do I reproduce. However here is the js code: http://dpaste.com/20TH1Q4 . `displayCommentBox` is responsible for adding comment on the fly.
[11:58:26] <jquery852> and its okay if the code is not much... I will try to get help locally
[11:58:30] <jquery852> Thanks!
[12:01:29] <taplar> lets see
[12:01:54] <taplar> ok, so are you sure that it is doing that logic?
[12:02:21] <jquery852> you mean submit being triggered? yes
[12:02:22] <taplar> have you tried putting a console log before the replyBox.on() and see if that prints?
[12:03:53] <taplar> also a side note, in the displayCommentBox most of those variables are already jQuery objects, so it's unnecessary to wrap them in $()
[12:04:54] <taplar> and your repeating line 11 and 18
[12:05:07] <taplar> oh, cause of the append
[12:05:31] <jquery852> taplar: I see, I did not know that. I will make those changes. I printed `replyBox` before `on` and it does prints form
[12:05:37] <taplar> k
[12:05:59] <jquery852> taplar: yup. I check if I have already appended it or not. If I have appended, then I just hide the reply box
[12:06:27] <taplar> ok, and you are or are not seeing the 'triggered' message from the postComment function?
[12:07:26] <jquery852> taplar: I can see `triggered` but I am not able to figure out how do I access the data from the form
[12:07:38] <taplar> ah, ok
[12:07:49] <taplar> well, the 'form' your passing in is the reply box
[12:07:58] <taplar> is that the actual form object?
[12:08:26] <taplar> looks like it is the outer div
[12:08:27] <jquery852> taplar: its the jqquery form object, but textarea is empty
[12:08:37] <_TWG_> Was wondering if someone could tell me if this is a bad practice to use.  I have an API I need to get data from but it's really lacking in features.  I have a form on my page setup to take searchText and searchType(dropdown).  The API does not allow me to send values back to query against.  Would it be okay if I loaded the data into arrays ahead of
[12:08:37] <_TWG_>  time in the background and then just search the array?
[12:09:18] <taplar> jquery852: try this: console.log(form.find('.reply.form').serialize());
[12:09:47] <jquery852> taplar: I will do that. but there can be multiple forms right?
[12:10:10] <taplar> yep, but your looking inside the context of the replyBox that was submitted
[12:10:48] <jquery852> taplar: I see. let me check
[12:14:13] <jquery852> taplar: prints empty line :(
[12:14:25] <taplar> humm
[12:14:54] <taplar> console.log(form.prop('outerHTML'));
[12:15:17] <jquery852> `document.formdata` also does not have the content
[12:16:21] <jquery852> taplar: teh second line printed this http://dpaste.com/096B8VQ but it does not have textarea content
[12:17:53] <jquery852> taplar: `document.replyBoxEvent.target` is also empty
[12:18:02] <jquery852> I mean textaera is a empty
[12:19:00] <taplar> console.log(form.find('.reply.form textarea').val())
[12:20:33] <jquery852> taplar: oh my...this had the content!!! can you tell me what was the mistake I was doing
[12:20:43] <taplar> that printed it?
[12:20:46] <jquery852> yes
[12:21:00] <taplar> ok, so the outerHTML was just showing what the html was, not what the dom had for values
[12:21:11] <taplar> which change
[12:21:22] <taplar> ok, so i would suggest one of two things
[12:21:53] <taplar> either change the variable name of the function from 'form' to something like 'formcontainer' or whatever, so it's clear it is not the actual form.  or change the calling of it to pass in the actual form so it matches
[12:22:04] <taplar> and then like we just did you can lookup the elements
[12:22:12] <jquery852> please go ahead. btw `console.log(form.find('textarea').val());` also worked.
[12:22:28] <taplar> yeah, cause it's a child
[12:22:42] <taplar> but as the code was 'form' is misleading as it's not the form, it's a parent of the form
[12:22:49] <jquery852> I am still not able to understand it :(
[12:23:01] <taplar> which part?
[12:23:15] <jquery852> wait, I will try to reread
[12:24:41] <jquery852> can you explain this: or change the calling of it to pass in the actual form so it matches
[12:24:58] <taplar> ok, so the variable name is 'form', so we'd expect it to be a reference to the form
[12:25:07] <taplar> but as we see it's not, it's the parent div
[12:25:11] <jquery852> yes
[12:25:21] <taplar> so when you do this
[12:25:24] <jquery852> I have changed it to formContainer
[12:25:41] <taplar> postComment(event, $(this))
[12:25:46] <taplar> your giving it the container
[12:25:58] <taplar> if you didn't want to change the variable name, you could just change that line to be
[12:26:04] <taplar> postComment(event, $(this).find('form'))
[12:26:14] <taplar> or the class selector for the form you were using
[12:26:22] <jquery852> I see, let me try that.
[12:27:00] <jquery852> one last question, why console wasntt showing dom values?
[12:27:18] <taplar> serialize really should have, so i don't get that
[12:27:27] <taplar> but for the outerHTML, that is showing you the markup
[12:27:36] <taplar> which is not the dom
[12:27:48] <taplar> it's loaded into the dom, but the dom can change without it reflecting in the markup
[12:28:12] <jquery852> I think serializer didn;t have cos I was accessing the parent element
[12:28:15] <taplar> whole point of markup is to generate the constructs in the dom.  after that, it's not really necessary to keep it insync
[12:28:32] <jquery852> oh! I thought its synced always
[12:28:36] <taplar> nope
[12:28:52] <taplar> which is why some people view source and get confused when stuff isn't shown
[12:29:24] <taplar> inspect element is a little better as I believe, don't hold me to it, but the inspectors try to show what is in the dom
[12:29:50] <jquery852> great
[12:30:02] <jquery852> thank you very very much taplar :D
[12:30:07] <duch_kazatel> they DO show what's in the dom.
[12:30:08] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:30:09] <taplar> np
[12:30:16] <taplar> welp there ya go, :)
[12:30:39] <jquery852> :D
[12:31:15] <bonks> Hey guys, how do I show data- attributes from the outerHTML property?
[12:31:42] <taplar> outerHTML is going to give you a string.  not sure what your asking
[12:32:10] <duch_kazatel> why not .closest() the element and use .data() from there?
[12:32:13] <bonks> taplar: I want to output the data- attributes within that string.
[12:32:26] <bonks> duch_kazatel: The string is required as a "template" for kendoui
[12:32:35] <bonks> So it cannot contain objects
[12:34:19] <bonks> ie: $('<img />').data('storeId', 1)[0].outerHTML
[12:34:25] <bonks> output: <img>
[12:34:40] <taplar> lol, we just taked about this
[12:34:42] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[12:35:08] <taplar> data() puts it in the dom, not in the markup
[12:35:19] <Cork> uh
[12:35:19] <taplar> outerHTML is the markup
[12:35:36] <Cork> no data() puts in in an object inside jquery
[12:35:36] <bonks> Oops I was switched windows when I asked the question
[12:35:49] <Cork> the markup is never updated
[12:35:52] <Cork> the dom is though
[12:35:56] <taplar> yeah
[12:36:25] <Cork> bonks: if you want the data values inside the dom use .attr('data-storeId', 1)
[12:36:32] <Cork> though note attributes can only be strings
[12:37:23] <bonks> Cork: Hmm that is what I did originally but something was making my attribute names all lowercase
[12:37:30] <Cork> also $('<img />', { attr: { storeId: 1 } })[0].outerHTML == '<img data-storeId="1">'
[12:37:37] <bonks> So I thought using .data() would fix this
[12:37:39] <Cork> ah correct
[12:37:49] <Cork> bonks: cause attributes are lowercase
[12:38:01] <Cork> they are case insensitive
[12:38:24] <bonks> Cork: Does that include data names?
[12:38:33] * hlvwrk strips down to his boxers.
[12:38:35] <Cork> as they are attributes so...
[12:38:40] * hlvwrk runs around #jquery
[12:38:47] <Cork> it is just a prefix in a normal attribute
[12:38:57] * hlvwrk puts on a top hat.
[12:39:10] <taplar> didn't know you were a girl hlvwrk
[12:39:25] <hlvwrk> me neither. :o
[12:39:39] <taplar> my condolences
[12:51:51] <taplar> how to tell your in a room filled with dudes.  you make a size joke and it goes quiet
[12:57:31] <reactjs593> Hi!
[12:57:39] <reactjs593> I got an question regarding Ajax and ES6
[12:57:47] <reactjs593> is " success: (res) => {} " okay to use?
[12:58:01] <duch_kazatel> i'd use .done() instead, but that should be fine.
[12:58:47] <reactjs593> Got an example here
[12:58:48] <reactjs593> http://pastebin.com/tmpUXvK6
[12:59:06] <reactjs593> I am using it in a React component, and the React thread pointed me towards you guys
[12:59:07] <duch_kazatel> your 'this' isn't going to be what you think it is fwiw.
[12:59:28] <reactjs593> do I need to do a var self = this?
[12:59:38] <reactjs593> outside of the ajax function
[12:59:46] <duch_kazatel> or .bind(), or don't rely on context, or...
[12:59:53] <shoky_> arrow functions preserve "this", no?
[13:00:04] <reactjs593> the arrow functions bind
[13:00:06] <reactjs593> so they should
[13:00:10] <reactjs593> not sure though
[13:00:12] <duch_kazatel> shoky_ but wouldn't 'this' be the ajax call be the ajax call?
[13:00:22] <reactjs593> true
[13:00:32] <duch_kazatel> i could have that totally wrong.
[13:00:35] <duch_kazatel> you could give it a try :)
[13:00:40] <reactjs593> but this has worked before, but with using React.createClass ES5
[13:01:01] <duch_kazatel> just not with a fat arrow ;)
[13:01:09] <duch_kazatel> also, i'd check out .done() instead.
[13:01:53] <reactjs593> so $.ajax({blablabla}).done(code)?
[13:02:05] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[13:02:10] <reactjs593> allright
[13:02:46] <shoky_> i think "this" inside would be the same as "this" outisde (with an arrow function), even if $.ajax tries to change it with .call/.apply
[13:02:58] <shoky_> because arrow functions ;p
[13:03:07] <duch_kazatel> you could very well be right.
[13:03:16] <duch_kazatel> i'm not a fan of arrows personally, so I haven't played with them.
[13:03:25] <shoky_> ( ()=>{console.log(this)} ).call('foo')    seems to confirm it
[13:03:31] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[13:04:11] <reactjs593> Indeed
[13:04:58] <reactjs593> wait wtf
[13:05:12] <reactjs593> doesnt  .done() take res as parameter?
[13:05:12] <reactjs593> http://puu.sh/mwQ7O/89ad11b4b5.png
[13:05:25] <duch_kazatel> it can.
[13:05:26] <reactjs593> so .done(function(res){});
[13:05:34] <reactjs593> however
[13:05:35] <shoky_> you don't have to specify arguments if you don't use them
[13:05:57] <reactjs593> when I run $.get(url).done((res) => {console.log(res);});
[13:05:59] <reactjs593> I dont get anythinig
[13:06:16] <shoky_> should work
[13:06:38] <duch_kazatel> check your network tab maybe?
[13:07:19] <reactjs593> hmm
[13:07:24] <reactjs593> the .done doesnt run at all
[13:08:01] <duch_kazatel> is the network request successfully firing?
[13:09:26] <duch_kazatel> also: i just used a fat arrow for the success of an ajax call and my `this` was the window object.
[13:10:23] <shoky_> well it was probably window outside too?
[13:10:31] <reactjs593> It works now
[13:10:46] <duch_kazatel> within jQuery(function($) {});
[13:10:54] <reactjs593> problem was, I had a componentWillReceiveProps function. It never recieved new props
[13:11:01] <reactjs593> so componentDidMount saved the day
[13:11:21] <shoky_> duch are you saying that was unexpected, or just confirming?
[13:11:23] <reactjs593> and $.get(url).done((res) => { 	this.setState({}); }); worked
[13:11:52] <duch_kazatel> shoky_ confirming that the "this" context within success/done are the window object.
[13:12:13] <shoky_> kk
[13:18:33] <hfp> Hi, I am using jQuery 2.1.4 and I have an array of nodes. Some of the nodes are text, others are text wrapped in elements. On the text nodes, I can do `node.text()` and get the actual text. But on the elements, I need to to `node.outerText` because .text is undefined. Is there a single method that would return these values that would be safe to call on any nodes?
[13:18:54] <duch_kazatel> how are you selecting these elements?
[13:19:29] <hfp> It's in a Knockout component, so Knockout takes care of selecting them
[13:19:51] <duch_kazatel> .text() should work for all jquery objects, so something here feels off.
[13:33:35] <Cork> duch_kazatel: notes not elements
[13:33:49] <Cork> hfp: jquery isn't really geared for working with text nodes
[13:34:02] <Cork> you are normally better of using native js there
[13:34:13] <duch_kazatel> was making sure there wasn't confusion about "jquery objects are arrays of nodes"
[13:34:18] <shoky_> also don't use .outerText :S
[13:34:39] <Cork> not even sure what outerText would do on a text node...
[13:34:46] <shoky_> it's only "useful" as a setter
[13:34:54] <shoky_> as a getter it's exactly the same as innerText
[13:34:59] <shoky_> and it's non-standard anyway
[13:35:03] <bonks> Hey, so back to the case insensitive attributes topic.. do you guys use all lowercase even when setting data() values? Or hyphenated words?
[13:35:19] <duch_kazatel> i tend to just use lowercase personally.
[13:35:24] <shoky_> oh, you asked on a text node, yeah, text nodes don't have it
[13:35:30] <Cork> bonks: there is a standard in the dom/css world
[13:35:53] <Cork> bonks: attributes is [a-z]+"-"[a-z]+
[13:36:17] <Cork> properties are [a-z][A-Z][a-z]+
[13:36:25] <Cork> css is same as attributes
[13:36:40] <Cork> so an attribute is data-my-magic-property
[13:36:52] <Cork> and that becomes dataMyMagicProperty as a property
[13:37:11] <Cork> i would recommend following that standard
[13:37:30] <bonks> Got it. I come a c# background and was hesitent to use hyphens
[13:38:43] <bonks> Ah for some reason I was thinking I'd access data attributes as properties. I think that thought kind of swayed my opinion on using hyphens
[13:38:54] <Cork> and to reference from css -webkit-background-color becomes style.webkitBackgroundColor
[13:39:59] <bonks> Oh? Are those two different members with similar names or does the latter automatically know to reference --webkit-background-color?
[13:40:28] <hellyeah> hey
[13:40:50] <Cork> bonks: well that specific one is a vendor prefixed one so it doesn't actually have to do that conversion
[13:41:12] <Cork> bonks: but standard properties follows that naming conversion
[13:41:25] <Cork> bonks: it is separate apis, and invalid css isn't kept
[13:41:38] <Cork> so no it isn't magically converted by the browser
[13:41:42] <Cork> it is hardcoded apis
[13:41:45] <bonks> Good to know. Saving this convo :D Thanks!
[13:41:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  you there? or you are in game? :XD
[13:41:55] <taplar> both
[13:42:35] <hellyeah> do you have time to help me?
[13:42:41] <taplar> sure
[13:42:51] <hellyeah> thanks god bless you
[13:43:33] <claytonzaugg> Anyone know a good channel I can ask questions about parallelization of our CDN for web optimization?
[13:43:43] <hellyeah> the issue is disabl input box "pervious" when they are not empty. http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/592/
[13:44:11] <taplar> yup, so we have ln 37 now
[13:45:03] <hellyeah> i guess i need to modify my if statement.
[13:45:47] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:46:01] <hellyeah> we got last datapicker
[13:46:46] <hellyeah> okey we call disable before creating
[13:49:52] <hellyeah> somehow i need to ensure datapickers are empty or not
[13:49:56] <hellyeah> right?
[13:50:16] <taplar> as you have described the issue to me, yep
[13:53:20] <hellyeah> okey here it is
[13:54:00] <hellyeah> but  line 33 just give me the val of first input box. Is it enough or do i need to do smt else? http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/594/
[13:54:52] <taplar> describe to me what your trying to do
[13:55:23] <hellyeah> well i try to see input box val is undefined or some real value
[13:55:33] <taplar> describe how you would do that
[13:55:50] <hellyeah> thanks to this i can do if(blah !== undefined') disable input box
[13:56:15] <hellyeah> i try to describe in last line
[13:56:52] <hellyeah> first find datapicker then get the last one then find inputboxes that has .input class and get the value of them
[13:56:59] <hellyeah> doesnt it make sense?
[13:57:06] <taplar> go on
[14:00:16] <hellyeah> taplar:  i got the value
[14:00:36] <hellyeah> when you select a date in input box i got the date
[14:00:55] <hellyeah> but when you first create it is undefined
[14:01:06] <hellyeah> but it is not important
[14:01:21] <hellyeah> when you click create button it will check input box is empty or not
[14:01:32] <taplar> which one?
[14:01:51] <taplar> there are two right?
[14:01:58] <hellyeah> yes there are two
[14:02:01] <taplar> :o
[14:02:02] <hellyeah> the problem is
[14:02:13] <hellyeah> i can get the value of one of them
[14:02:20] <taplar> why is that a problem?
[14:03:56] <taplar> first off, how do you know if you have a datepicker at all?
[14:04:01] <taplar> could be the first click
[14:05:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:06:06] <hellyeah> i guess first i need to check element exist at first place
[14:08:22] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/596/
[14:08:53] <taplar> looks familiar
[14:08:59] <taplar> ln 35
[14:09:32] <hellyeah> is it false?
[14:09:40] <taplar> like i've seen it some where else in the code before
[14:10:28] <taplar> and yeah that's bad
[14:10:32] <taplar> it's always going to be true
[14:10:46] <taplar> objects are truthy
[14:11:02] <taplar> but back to my previous point.  i've seen this some where else
[14:11:08] <hellyeah> when this doesnt exist it is also truthy
[14:11:12] <hellyeah> i dont remember
[14:11:38] <taplar> ln 35, you see that any where else?
[14:12:26] <hellyeah> i didnt see in current code?
[14:12:30] <taplar> no?
[14:13:40] <hellyeah-home> hey
[14:14:05] <hellyeah-home> taplar: i am sorry i didnt see that piece of code anywhere else
[14:14:10] <taplar> no?
[14:14:25] <hellyeah-home> yes
[14:14:26] <taplar> line 33 looks interesting
[14:14:51] <hellyeah-home> $datePicker = $datePart.find('.datepicker').last().find('.input').val(); ?
[14:15:06] <taplar> we're looking at the same fiddle dude.  yes
[14:15:32] <hellyeah-home> it is similar but not same ::X
[14:15:38] <taplar> oh?
[14:16:06] <taplar> looks like your finding datepicker in date part in both parts
[14:16:59] <hellyeah-home> giver me a sec
[14:18:11] <hellyeah-home> is it better now http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/597/ ?
[14:18:47] <taplar> where'd your last go?
[14:19:38] <hellyeah-home> sorry http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/598/
[14:20:20] <taplar> alright, so we got the last datepicker, and then we're checking if that object exists
[14:20:39] <taplar> but we know, as I said earlier, objects are truthy
[14:20:50] <hellyeah-home> what do you mean by that?
[14:21:01] <hellyeah-home> when object does not exist
[14:21:06] <hellyeah-home> how is it truthy?
[14:21:06] <taplar> it does
[14:21:11] <wa5ted> so i have this video file that i select via an input file select native element, I am taking said video and injecting it into a dynamically created video element (using base64 code), however on mobile (chrome, nexus 6p) I run into the issue of the video not loading, no errors in the mobile debug, any ideas?
[14:21:19] <wa5ted> http://ef978e8b.ngrok.io
[14:21:21] <taplar> the jQuery object that is the result of the find exists
[14:21:23] <wa5ted> ^ can use this to test
[14:21:32] <taplar> it doesn't contain anything, but that object does exist
[14:21:39] <hellyeah-home> ops sorry
[14:21:50] <hellyeah-home> you click create for firing that function
[14:21:59] <hellyeah-home> you are right
[14:22:11] <taplar> that's not relevant
[14:22:24] <taplar> $('#idOfSomethingThatDoesntExist')
[14:22:29] <taplar> that's going to return an object
[14:22:39] <taplar> doesn't contain anything.  has .length of zero
[14:22:42] <taplar> but it is an object
[14:22:58] <hellyeah-home> yes
[14:23:08] <hellyeah-home> because it is in html markup? right
[14:23:14] <taplar> no, it's a jquery object
[14:23:18] <taplar> which find() returns
[14:23:30] <hellyeah-home> but find return html element
[14:23:33] <taplar> no
[14:23:34] <hellyeah-home> true?
[14:23:36] <hellyeah-home> hmm
[14:23:39] <taplar> it returns a jquery object
[14:23:47] <taplar> containing a reference to that dom element
[14:23:50] <taplar> or elements
[14:23:53] <taplar> or no elements
[14:24:27] <hellyeah-home> i understand
[14:24:45] <hellyeah-home> okey
[14:24:58] <hellyeah-home> can we go on :p
[14:25:10] <taplar> we still have our issue
[14:25:18] <hellyeah-home> yes
[14:25:28] <hellyeah-home> object exist one way or another
[14:25:47] <hellyeah-home> i dont know what to check :p
[14:26:10] <taplar> (1:22:34 PM) taplar: doesn't contain anything.  has .length of zero
[14:27:55] <hellyeah-home> yes
[14:27:58] <taplar> yup
[14:28:17] <hellyeah-home> right but has a length of zero also means val of input box is undefined?
[14:28:23] <hellyeah-home> is it false?
[14:28:23] <taplar> nope
[14:28:32] <taplar> zero means they are not there to begin with
[14:28:34] <duch_kazatel> it's an empty string.
[14:28:46] <duch_kazatel> :) undefined and '' aren't the same, but they're both falsy.
[14:29:00] <hellyeah-home> is it js thing?
[14:29:06] <hellyeah-home> i am kinda confused
[14:29:16] <taplar> truthyness is shared by a few languages
[14:29:21] <hellyeah-home> i mean if string is empty length is zero
[14:29:25] <taplar> no
[14:29:30] <taplar> we're talking about different things
[14:29:30] <hellyeah-home> but it is defined
[14:29:40] <taplar> $datePicker is not a string.  it is a result set
[14:29:57] <hellyeah-home> set has zero element
[14:30:01] <_TWG_> I have this snippet of code that is copying the contents of an API into an array.  When it has finished copying and I console.log the new array, it's empty.  So I added a console.log inside the each and all the data writes out just fine.  What did I do wrong?  http://kopy.io/MmMT4#3xWvhHnbPqHFzV
[14:30:02] <taplar> could
[14:30:05] <hellyeah-home> but set is defined
[14:30:06] <taplar> might be > 0
[14:30:08] <taplar> yes
[14:30:26] <hellyeah-home> okey if i check datapicker.length is zero
[14:30:36] <taplar> you can just do .length
[14:30:43] <hellyeah-home> i dont need to check datepicker.find(.input).val is undefined
[14:30:45] <taplar> anything other than 0 is truthy, in regards to numbers
[14:30:52] <hellyeah-home> i dont need that if
[14:30:58] <taplar> your going to fast
[14:31:05] <taplar> you haven't gotten past the result set has stuff in it yet
[14:31:09] <taplar> fix that first
[14:31:29] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ but your console.log('Name: ' + item.Name + '      ID: ' + item.Id); is showing the right things?
[14:31:48] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel yes it writes every line out from the API.
[14:32:15] <hellyeah-home> taplar: are we good here? http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/599/
[14:32:38] <taplar> what are you doing?
[14:32:41] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ that seems unusual.  i'd have to see the data coming back from your server.
[14:33:59] <_TWG_> Okay.  So I moved the console.log up to right after my $.each and it writes out the data.  Why won't it write it out after the ajax call? duch_kazatel
[14:34:12] <duch_kazatel> back way up, _TWG_
[14:34:19] <_TWG_> Okay
[14:34:22] <duch_kazatel> so your code now matches http://kopy.io/MmMT4#3xWvhHnbPqHFzV?
[14:34:52] <duch_kazatel> but before that console.log(departments); was after the ajax call, right?
[14:35:23] <hellyeah-home> taplar: it was silly
[14:35:46] <_TWG_> I hand typed that over and put the console in the wrong spot the first time on kopy.io.  It was after the ajax call.  Now it's inside the done call.
[14:35:57] <_TWG_> Do I need to use a promise again to wait for it to run?
[14:36:01] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[14:36:06] <duch_kazatel> .done() IS using promises.
[14:36:13] <_TWG_> oh, okay
[14:36:25] <duch_kazatel> so anything that relies on departments needs to be in that callback.
[14:36:29] <duch_kazatel> or called from there
[14:36:43] <duch_kazatel> in fact, you don't need the departments var at that global scope at all :)
[14:37:11] <hellyeah-home> taplar: get last result set
[14:37:28] <taplar> last of the result set
[14:37:50] <taplar> which becomes a result set of just one (or none)
[14:37:55] <_TWG_> Gotcha.  The thing I'm running into is that someone create a internal API and I'm trying to pull all of our departments out for a search box.  The way they wrote the API I can't append anything to it to search the JSON so I'm needing to write the data to a local array so I can search it. duch_kazatel
[14:38:12] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ really lost with that.
[14:38:41] <_TWG_> Let me code it up real quick to show you.
[14:38:43] <duch_kazatel> you have an api that returns a bunch of data and you'd like to search through it to find something?
[14:39:02] <hellyeah-home> taplar: line 34 http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/600/
[14:39:29] <taplar> ok, think about what your doing
[14:39:45] <taplar> you got your datepicker, and your finding the inputs
[14:39:54] <taplar> inputS
[14:40:03] <taplar> and trying to get the value
[14:40:05] <taplar> THE value
[14:40:20] <_TWG_> Yes.  I have a departments, buildings, and employees.  I have a form where a user can type in what they are looking for and then pick one of those areas out of it and then I was going to use jquery to search the data and display the results. duch_kazatel
[14:40:40] <taplar> and again, your jumping the gun
[14:40:40] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ yeah, that's easy.  bummer that you're just getting back all the data.
[14:40:54] <taplar> fix your conditional to check if there is a datepicker or not
[14:40:57] <duch_kazatel> but there's a way to do that a little easier.
[14:41:05] <_TWG_> Yes.  I don't think who wrote it really understood ASP.NET enough to know how to code it correctly.
[14:41:08] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ have an example of the data?
[14:41:19] <_TWG_> Sure, let me write it up.
[14:41:21] <hellyeah-home> taplar: i suppose you meant value of input boxes with result set
[14:41:32] <taplar> no, look
[14:41:45] <taplar> when you look up elements, you get a jquery object with a result set inside
[14:41:55] <taplar> that result set is basicly an array of all those elements
[14:42:01] <taplar> which can be empty
[14:43:08] <taplar> if we're going to operate on the last element, which would be the only element in the result set, we need to know that there is actually an element in it
[14:43:27] <taplar> *only element because of our last()
[14:44:29] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ just making sure you're not making a full example?"
[14:44:36] <duch_kazatel> Just want an example of the data.
[14:45:33] <_TWG_> No, just a small sample of the data the API returns.  http://kopy.io/8wVg6#0gDMxk1MwvVQll duch_kazatel
[14:45:39] <duch_kazatel> rad
[14:45:41] <_TWG_> sorry, had someone walk into my office asking a question.
[14:45:49] <duch_kazatel> okay cool.
[14:45:55] <hellyeah-home> taplar: only element in it
[14:46:15] <duch_kazatel> that's not valid JSON _TWG_
[14:46:15] <hellyeah-home> because we work with last()
[14:46:19] <_TWG_> I probably don't have the brackets setup correctly
[14:46:23] <duch_kazatel> you'
[14:46:27] <hellyeah-home> and this only element shouldnt be empty right
[14:46:31] <duch_kazatel> *you're missing quotes around all those strings :) but one sec.
[14:46:40] <_TWG_> sorry, was quickly typing
[14:46:42] <hellyeah-home> taplar: there is actually two cases i need to handle
[14:46:43] <duch_kazatel> it
[14:46:44] <taplar> we don't care if it's empty just yet
[14:46:47] <duch_kazatel> *it's fine.  one sec.
[14:46:56] <taplar> we're trying to test if it even exists right now
[14:46:59] <taplar> fix that
[14:47:03] <hellyeah-home> okey no problem what i mean is there must be 1 element everytime
[14:47:14] <_TWG_> I'm also having to use JSONP because it's coming from an https domain
[14:47:19] <hellyeah-home> because we are working ith last()
[14:47:21] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.
[14:47:31] <taplar> must, no
[14:47:36] <taplar> can be, yes
[14:47:51] <hellyeah-home> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/601/
[14:47:54] <taplar> the last of an empty set is still an empty set
[14:48:23] <taplar> what are you doing?
[14:48:35] <taplar> on ln 35
[14:49:55] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ https://jsfiddle.net/4ndydq6k/ i gotta bounce, but here's the basic gist.
[14:50:40] <_TWG_> thanks duch_kazatel
[14:51:25] <hellyeah-home> taplar: sorry i forgot .length http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/602/
[14:51:48] <taplar> alright!
[14:52:05] <taplar> so, inside that if we know that a datepicker exists and it has two nested inputs
[14:52:25] <taplar> what now?
[14:52:55] <hellyeah-home> now it is time to check those nested ,nputs value are undefined or not
[14:53:06] <taplar> do it man
[14:58:53] <hellyeah-home> taplar: one last issue here i couldnt get both input bpxes value http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/603/
[15:00:06] <taplar> so lets say what we're trying to do again
[15:00:38] <taplar> you want to disable one?  both?   when?  when one is empty?  when both are empty?  both are filled in?
[15:01:17] <hellyeah-home> the value of input box is not "undefined" false disable the pervious element of last element
[15:01:27] <taplar> "the value of input box"
[15:01:29] <taplar> there are two
[15:01:33] <taplar> that's not a clear statement
[15:01:37] <hellyeah-home> taplar: i want to disable both when there are filled in
[15:01:44] <taplar> ok
[15:01:52] <hellyeah-home> the value of each input boxes
[15:02:00] <hellyeah-home> is it okey now?
[15:02:05] <taplar> so if either one of them are empty, you don't want to disable them
[15:02:58] <taplar> ?
[15:03:03] <hellyeah-home> yes
[15:03:07] <hellyeah-home> umm
[15:03:13] <hellyeah-home> sec
[15:03:15] <taplar> so how can we check if either one of them doesn't have a value
[15:04:05] <taplar> or check that both do
[15:04:34] <hellyeah-home> http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/604/
[15:04:43] <hellyeah-home> make sense?
[15:05:06] <taplar> that works, :)
[15:08:11] <hellyeah-home> but just one of them is disabled http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/605/
[15:08:44] <taplar> that sucks.  why's that?
[15:09:04] <hellyeah-home> i seperate disable into two parts
[15:09:11] <hellyeah-home> i assume needs to be disabled
[15:09:13] <taplar> $($datePicker)
[15:09:17] <taplar> -_-
[15:09:23] <hellyeah-home> re wrapping?
[15:09:29] <taplar> u tell me
[15:09:52] <hellyeah-home> sorry
[15:09:56] <hellyeah-home> i forgot again
[15:10:11] <taplar> do the least amount of work to get your result :P
[15:10:38] <hellyeah-home> okey nothing changed :o http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/606/
[15:11:04] <taplar> ok, so why is disable in two parts?
[15:11:09] <taplar> and what's with the prev()
[15:11:31] <hellyeah-home> when you create second element
[15:11:39] <hellyeah-home> first element is not last anymore
[15:11:43] <taplar> what second element?
[15:11:47] <hellyeah-home> so there is new one as last
[15:11:56] <taplar> we have our $datePicker
[15:12:02] <hellyeah-home> when you click create third time
[15:12:09] <hellyeah-home> you will get second element
[15:12:13] <taplar> so?
[15:12:23] <hellyeah-home> well i will show you
[15:12:28] <taplar> no dude
[15:12:37] <taplar> we HAVE the last element before the next one is created
[15:12:48] <taplar> that's the context we are working in
[15:12:53] <hellyeah-home> aha
[15:12:57] <hellyeah-home> :p
[15:13:22] <hellyeah-home> i just make my life unbaerable sometimes
[15:13:24] <hellyeah-home> i fixed that
[15:13:28] <taplar> if you had to do that, why would you not have had to have done it in the if?
[15:13:52] <hellyeah-home> we have last
[15:14:08] <hellyeah-home> because we create new element after disabling last elemnet right
[15:14:13] <taplar> yep
[15:14:59] <hellyeah-home> i guess
[15:15:05] <hellyeah-home> what i need to learn is
[15:15:19] <hellyeah-home> back myself off little bit from code
[15:15:26] <hellyeah-home> take some breather and look again
[15:16:08] <hellyeah-home> anyway may be you wonder why i did this
[15:16:13] <hellyeah-home> what is my purpose
[15:16:17] <taplar> nah
[15:16:26] <taplar> i don't need to know those things, :)
[15:17:19] <taplar> if I had to know all about a persons app to be able to help them with js, i'd quit, :P
[15:18:09] <hellyeah-home> taplar: ic
[15:18:32] <taplar> that's why being modular is important
[15:18:39] <taplar> having small self contained pieces
[15:18:39] <hellyeah-home> but please allow me to this at least tell it make sense or not just one sentence
[15:19:06] <hellyeah-home> ic
[15:20:25] <snowman44> duch_kazatel you happen to be here? :D
[15:21:21] <taplar> he said something about bouncing.  might have a meeting or some work or something
[15:22:10] <snowman44> ahh shoot. thanks taplar ^^
[15:22:17] <hellyeah-home> anyway i have other cases to take care off
[15:22:23] <hellyeah-home> damn
[15:23:01] <taplar> k, well fiddle with them.  don't forget to take breaks.  i'm going to hop back in my game, :D
[15:23:17] <hellyeah-home> thanks
[15:40:51] <duch_kazatel> back from lunch
[15:47:40] <user_corrupt> I am calling a facebook share dialog script, and trying to modify the width of its ".generic_dialog_popup" in the following manner: http://jsbin.com/fijupexapi/edit?js    "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ." is the error that I am getting..
[15:51:55] <user_corrupt> ok, $(".generic_dialog_popup").css({"width": "749px"});  is what I am trying now
[15:52:40] <duch_kazatel> user_corrupt $(.generic_dialog_popup).css('width', '749px'); doesnt work because it needs to be a string.
[15:53:35] <z1haze2> I am trying to add in the hostname and protocol via jquery but its literally just adding in ' + location.protocol ... instead of the actual protocol
[15:53:45] <user_corrupt> duch_kazatel: please bear with me... does "$(".generic_dialog_popup").css({"width": "749px"});" look any better?
[15:53:45] <z1haze2> what could I be doing wrong?
[15:55:21] <z1haze2> ... <img src="' + location.protocol + '//' + location.hostname + '/banners/' + newVal + '" ...
[15:55:42] <z1haze2> why would that output 'location.hostname'
[15:57:04] <z1haze2> actually its right here that's doing it: $('#banner-container img').attr("src", "' + location.protocol + '//' + location.hostname + '/banners/" + newVal);
[16:09:12] <user_corrupt> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/fijupexapi/edit?js is how I have it now, but it's not having any effect...
[16:11:47] <duch_kazatel> user_corrupt .generic_dialog_popup does this element exist on pageload or after the popup is created?
[16:14:39] <user_corrupt> duch_kazatel: yeah, it does, but come to think of it, editing it in the style window has no effect.. I have to edit the value in the markup area for it to have any effect
[16:58:06] <_TWG_> Can anyone help me with using .unique with an array?
[16:59:28] <shoky_> $.unique ?  you shouldn't really be using that
[17:00:45] <PCatinean> Would anyone know why jquery ui datetime picker would not work in a firefox browser on xp when on newer windows and ubuntu it works
[17:00:53] <PCatinean> customer reported the field looks disabled
[17:02:23] <duch_kazatel> PCatinean what version?
[17:02:37] <_TWG_> shoky_ why is that?
[17:02:42] <PCatinean> Latest firefox, downloaded like a week ago duch_kazatel
[17:03:41] <shoky_> _TWG_: because it only works on arrays of DOM elements, and because its docs say "You probably will never need to use it."
[17:04:08] <_TWG_> So what do I use to test remove duplicate entries in my array?
[17:04:19] <shoky_> not jquery ;p
[17:04:21] <PCatinean> so wierd
[17:04:33] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229645/remove-duplicates-from-javascript-array
[17:04:35] <duch_kazatel> lots of ways to do that.
[17:05:03] <_TWG_> thanks for the resource duch_kazatel
[17:05:22] <duch_kazatel> quick google search, really.
[17:05:44] <_TWG_> Well I came up with the unique and another page that had something similar to what you sent me.
[17:06:20] <duch_kazatel> the docs for unique are pretty clear at explaining that it's not really something you need in this case :)
[17:09:18] <snowman44> ah duch_kazatel you're back
[17:10:19] <duch_kazatel> ?
[17:10:22] <snowman44> the people over reactjs couldn't help me out with this, thought you might have an idea. why does <TrackSeparator onMouseDown={function() {console.log("hey");}} /> not work, but <TrackSeparator onMouseDown={console.log("hey")} /> does?
[17:10:39] <duch_kazatel> neither of those use jquery fwiw.
[17:11:20] <duch_kazatel> and actually, inline handlers are gross.
[17:11:36] <snowman44> i was told there are no other event handlers in react
[17:11:45] <duch_kazatel> erm.
[17:11:48] <duch_kazatel> then that's a question for them?
[17:11:49] <duch_kazatel> brb
[17:13:26] <_TWG_> This is what I ended up with creating my own unique function.  I need to check it on the id of each array item.  http://kopy.io/eyOQT#l1VhFUvjrDR0R0
[18:10:57] <empedokles78_> What am I doing wrong?: https://jsfiddle.net/rnr2wgv6/4/ -> https://github.com/jonthornton/jquery-timepicker#timepicker-plugin-for-jquery
[18:42:28] <DRE_> hi guys, anybody know where I could browse documentation for jquery 1.11?
[19:36:54] <SeanJAnderson1> I need assistance with a little script im writing up for myself. attempting to gather some data via ajax, with CORS.
[19:36:54] <SeanJAnderson1> Here is the code. http://jsfiddle.net/Sja91/zuq7vtLg/1/
[19:37:07] <duch_kazatel> Oh.
[19:37:13] <duch_kazatel> you're not going to be able to do that :(
[19:37:25] <duch_kazatel> the header thing has to do with the server you're pulling data from.
[19:37:43] <SeanJAnderson1> I'd like to note in the console i'm getting "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE"
[19:38:05] <SeanJAnderson1> duch_kazatel: any suggestions?
[19:38:18] <duch_kazatel> why do you think you have a CORS problem?
[19:38:25] <duch_kazatel> or is that just an aside?
[19:38:36] <SeanJAnderson1> I'm not 100% on what my problem is
[19:38:43] <duch_kazatel> okay
[19:38:45] <SeanJAnderson1> if i remove the header i get a different error
[19:39:07] <duch_kazatel> so you don't want that header at all - that's some they control, not you.
[19:39:16] <Sean_A91> thats what i thought
[19:39:47] <Sean_A91> I'm getting a " No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."
[19:39:51] <Sean_A91> error
[19:39:52] <duch_kazatel> right.
[19:39:55] <duch_kazatel> you cannot control that.
[19:39:59] <Sean_A91> so... basically i cant do anything
[19:40:02] <duch_kazatel> their server doesn't want you pulling from them.
[19:40:17] <Sean_A91> this is btw, where i got it from, http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Grand_Exchange_APIs
[19:40:45] <duch_kazatel> right, so they may not allow you to do this on a page.
[19:40:49] <duch_kazatel> but i'm seeing a response come back.
[19:40:49] <Sean_A91> So basically if i want to do this, I have to write a program instead of a web page.....
[19:41:19] <Sean_A91> Bummer
[19:41:27] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[19:41:46] <duch_kazatel> I'm getting data back.
[19:42:57] <Sean_A91> Oh?
[19:42:59] <Sean_A91> With jquery?
[19:43:12] <duch_kazatel> yep - why are you using such an old version btw?
[19:43:19] <Sean_A91> old version of jquery?
[19:43:26] <duch_kazatel> that fiddle was using 1.6.4
[19:43:29] <duch_kazatel> that's ancient.
[19:43:43] <Sean_A91> hah
[19:43:46] <Sean_A91> ok sorry
[19:43:55] <Sean_A91> must've clicked the wrong one by accident
[19:44:15] <Sean_A91> So, how did you get data? did you have to preflight it?
[19:45:14] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[19:45:19] <duch_kazatel> it's the network requeast itself working.
[19:45:55] <Sean_A91> Hm?
[19:46:09] <duch_kazatel> go to your network tab.
[19:46:15] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[19:48:52] <duch_kazatel> yeah, something is wacked here.
[19:49:34] <duch_kazatel> ah, firefox kind of works fine, but chrome doesn't.
[19:49:43] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you'll need a server-side setup to handle the fetch for you.
[19:49:58] * Sean_A91 sighs
[19:50:04] <Sean_A91> it was going to be such a simple thing
[19:50:23] <duch_kazatel> it's a security measure.
[19:50:29] <Sean_A91> yeah but
[19:50:36] <Sean_A91> what is the point of an API thats so closed down?
[19:50:36] <duch_kazatel> and you could do something pretty quick with restify and node.
[19:50:43] <duch_kazatel> give people access to data
[19:50:53] <Sean_A91> Well I guess i'll go see if i can do this in google spreadsheets, if that fails- yeah node will be my next client side choice
[19:51:01] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[19:51:05] <duch_kazatel> node isn't client-side...
[19:51:14] <Sean_A91> well
[19:51:18] <Sean_A91> let me reword that
[19:51:19] <Sean_A91> on my pc
[19:51:20] <Sean_A91> =p
[19:51:36] <duch_kazatel> hah okay.
[19:52:04] <duch_kazatel> it'll be pretty easy, either way
[19:52:09] <Sean_A91> mhm
[19:52:13] <Sean_A91> Thanks for the help duch_kazatel
[19:52:17] <duch_kazatel> definitely.
[19:52:46] <Sean_A91> I would report this issue with runescape but.... uh, ya, they don't have open ended support >_> its all lists and checkboxes and stuff
[19:52:57] <Sean_A91> nor any email or phone number stuff
[19:53:00] <duch_kazatel> they likely did that on purpose.
[19:53:05] <Sean_A91> lol yep
[19:53:13] <duch_kazatel> to protect user accounts
[19:53:19] <duch_kazatel> probably a limitation of how their system works.
[19:53:47] <Sean_A91> Nah, i'm sure its more, so they don't have to deal with things. they go through great lengths to hide any other sort of contact info
[19:53:56] <duch_kazatel> i mean the api lockdown.
[19:54:09] <Sean_A91> Oh
[19:54:11] <Sean_A91> right
[19:54:38] <Sean_A91> its not hard to allow requests from CORS for anyone on just that address though, if im not mistaken
[19:54:57] <duch_kazatel> again, system limitations./
[19:55:06] <duch_kazatel> if you're not careful, you expose a whole lot of private data.
[19:55:22] <duch_kazatel> they may also do it because they want to minimize the extra load.
[19:56:44] <duch_kazatel> anyway, enjoy.
[20:29:28] <sri66le> Is there a way to not allow to pick something another element?
[20:29:54] <sri66le> I have stripe setup with Laravel and I submit the form but it grabs the data from another form with a similar ID
[20:29:55] <sri66le> http://pastebin.com/jsrjTpXs
[22:04:50] <alturic> Hey guys, I'm looking for a way to tweak my current code (http://pastebin.com/raw/m8PHRKC0) but be able to make the dateregion var "unique" for the data var. The way it stands, regardless of the data var selected, if it contains something in the dataregion var it uses both values. So if you look at "500mb_height" as an example. In a simplistic way, I'm looking to do something to where "gfs"
[22:04:50] <alturic> has it's own 500mb_height since the "gfs" wouldn't contain both CONUS and EUROPE. I can't figure out a way that can allow me to get that to work. :-/
