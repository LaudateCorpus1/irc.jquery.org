[00:00:56] <markholmes> something like this will check if it isn't there: if ( !$("#post_form").length ) { }
[00:01:31] <markholmes> wait, sorry. you want to see if it _does_ exist and replace it?
[00:01:38] <arup_r> yes
[00:02:25] <markholmes> okay, well similar.
[00:02:30] <markholmes> if ( $("#post_form").length ) { }
[00:02:45] <markholmes> that will tell you if #post_form exists
[00:02:58] <arup_r> what is the function to replace ?
[00:03:21] <arup_r> ok got it http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/html_replacewith.asp
[00:03:27] <markholmes> don't use w3schools
[00:03:33] <markholmes> http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[00:03:35] <arup_r> and what about to add as a first child..
[00:03:39] <arup_r> markholmes: sure..
[00:03:53] <markholmes> to add it as the first child, use .prepend
[00:04:06] <arup_r> ok.. thanks
[00:04:11] <arup_r> let me try now

[04:01:48] <pyemkey> Hello peeps. Anyone can help me figure out why function is not executing inside setTimeout https://gist.github.com/pyemkey/195e998360778f1034ba I am getting error saying that policy_insurer_loader is not a function
[04:38:20] <delboy1978uk> hi guys
[04:38:51] <Tennis> hello del
[04:38:55] <Tennis> how you doing son
[04:39:06] <delboy1978uk> not 3 bad
[04:39:34] <Tennis> are you in the south? this weather is pants
[04:40:15] <delboy1978uk> i have a magento site here, and you can click shopping basket and a wee popup appears. I’d like to be able to click anywhere else outside the box and for it to close. how would i go about doing that?
[04:40:30] <delboy1978uk> i’m in scotland, and the weather looks nice but its cold
[04:42:26] <Tennis> $(document).click( function(){
[04:42:26] <Tennis>     $('#popup').hide();
[04:42:26] <Tennis> });
[04:42:50] <pyemkey> Hello peeps. Anyone can help me figure out why function is not executing inside setTimeout https://gist.github.com/pyemkey/195e998360778f1034ba I am getting error saying that policy_insurer_loader is not a function
[04:43:57] <Tennis> is that coffee script ?
[04:44:26] <delboy1978uk> pyemkey: then policy_insurer_loader is not a function. where is that function defined?
[04:44:33] <delboy1978uk> yeah it is coffee script
[04:44:38] <Tennis> i'm not too familiar at what line would you say the function is declared ? 8 ? or in another file?
[04:44:41] <delboy1978uk> which ive never used
[04:45:16] <pyemkey> I'm using backbone and function is outside. That's why I am using @ before function
[04:45:41] <pyemkey> When I move code from this function and put instead of what I have now everything works correctly
[04:45:50] <pyemkey> sorry for my english :)
[04:46:29] <Tennis> http://www.craigmdennis.com/articles/close-dropdowns-clicking-outside-jquery important that you have an onlick event for the popup too del
[04:47:42] <pyemkey> delboy1978uk: Uncaught TypeError: this.policy_insurer_loader is not a function this is what I can read from my console
[04:48:48] <delboy1978uk> where is the very first mention of policy_insurer_loader?
[04:49:12] <delboy1978uk> pyemkey: found this :-) https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-outside-events
[04:49:50] <pyemkey> delboy1978uk: I don't think plugin is what I need
[04:50:06] <pyemkey> I'm sure that there is way without plugin :)
[04:50:08] <delboy1978uk> oops sorry that was for Tennis
[04:50:16] <delboy1978uk> for my own problem :P
[04:50:24] <pyemkey> ok
[04:50:45] <delboy1978uk> find the function declaration (if there is one, it says it hasnt been defined)
[04:50:49] <Tennis> yeah i'm growing to love plugins
[04:51:00] <decx> dont
[04:51:01] <Tennis> playing with some emoji plugins atm
[04:51:25] <delboy1978uk> i made a few jquery plugins
[04:51:52] <decx> most of the time there is no reason for anything but a helperfunction
[04:52:01] <decx> instead of tacking everything on $
[04:52:11] <delboy1978uk> everyone loved my flipswitch plugin https://github.com/delboy1978uk/flipswitch
[04:52:25] <Tennis> is coffee script just preference in this instance or does it have advantages pyemkey ?
[04:52:49] <delboy1978uk> coffee script is a higher level language than javascript, thats all
[04:53:09] <decx> coffee script is just for peopel coming from another language
[04:53:18] <decx> and to confuse everyone who doesnt use it
[04:53:22] <delboy1978uk> so a coffee command is probably a shorter and easier way of calling more complex javascript
[04:53:30] <decx> it's not easier
[04:53:41] <Tennis> hmm , switches look cool
[04:53:46] <delboy1978uk> its quicker once you get used to it
[04:54:11] <Tennis> syntax is less syntaxxy right?
[04:54:13] <delboy1978uk> and a cookie bar
[04:54:14] <delboy1978uk> https://github.com/delboy1978uk/jquery.cookiebar
[04:54:31] <decx> you wrap this 27 times in your plugin
[04:54:35] <decx> start caching selectors
[04:55:10] <delboy1978uk> can you make a github issue with suggested fix?
[04:55:27] <delboy1978uk> or even fix it and send a pull request? :-D
[04:56:10] <decx> look http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/ZqSVH/12/
[04:56:22] <decx> on line 30 you cache $(this) into obj
[04:56:23] <delboy1978uk> this one was fun to build https://github.com/delboy1978uk/jqbezier
[04:56:35] <decx> and 2 lines later you use $(this) again instead of obj
[04:56:42] <delboy1978uk> ah lol
[04:56:52] <decx> all throughout the script there's $(this)
[04:56:52] <delboy1978uk> ok i’ll sort that when i get the chance
[04:57:00] <Tennis> i've totally seen the beizer curve one before, and thought i recognised your username
[04:57:02] <decx> so that means this will get wrapped into a jquery object every time
[04:57:27] <Tennis> #reddit ?
[04:58:35] <delboy1978uk> probably not on reddit, i dont use that much
[05:08:34] <delboy1978uk> tidied up, thanks decx https://github.com/delboy1978uk/flipswitch
[05:12:17] <PCatinean> People can use jquery.ui in commercial software yes?
[05:12:36] <PCatinean> Also what lightweight tooltip script would you guys recommend?
[05:14:15] <randomguy1> "You are free to use any jQuery Foundation project in any other project (even commercial projects) as long as the copyright header is left intact."
[05:14:46] <randomguy1> https://jquery.org/license/
[05:16:29] <randomguy1> what do you mean by tooltip script?  like the jquery ui tooltip?  or something extra?
[05:17:15] <Wes-> PCatinean: I recommend using the title attribute
[05:17:42] <randomguy1> lol, :)
[05:19:10] * Wes- is a minimalist
[05:19:48] <randomguy1> i was thinking i may know a couple ui/ux'ers who would argue if you design it right, it doesn't need a tooltip
[05:23:01] <Wes-> randomguy1++
[05:23:30] <Wes-> My boss keeps thinking giant paragraphs of tooltip tutorial is the key to an easy to use application
[05:24:13] <Wes-> He makes my head bleed a lot
[05:24:22] <randomguy1> lol
[05:26:12] <randomguy1> i dunno, i've seen both ends of the spectrum.  last project i was on was all about making it very obvious so that the learning curve was very shallow, as the user base has high turnover.  a few times I questioned stuff that looked like it was duplicates, but they had reasons, due to the previous sentence.  i understood it but.... lol, that can hurt too
[05:26:57] <randomguy1> those situations were you ask yourself, "seriously, how dumb are our users?"
[05:28:16] <Wes-> randomguy1: Yeah. I like to champion discoverability.  Too many docs get tl;dr even from well-meaning lusers
[05:29:05] <Wes-> randomguy1: but what I hate most is when you build an app that is supposed to be "easy to learn" and make it "hard to use" for anybody who is not stupid and has used it for more than an hour
[05:29:31] <Wes-> I once proposed a dancing paperclip that helps people in a meeting
[05:29:51] <Wes-> Not everybody knew I was being sarcastic
[05:30:01] <randomguy1> lol
[05:31:47] <Fogest> I'm happy the projects are work on are for other computer people in our department to use :P.
[05:42:41] <ramsub07> hello guys, I've commented my problem in the fiddle. please help me with that . http://jsfiddle.net/b07megcz/5/
[05:46:14] <simonfunk> how can i have dynamical access to an object? i tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/urarL3t8/ with no success
[05:50:41] <randomguy1> simonfunk: what error do you get?
[05:57:52] <randomguy1> simonfunk: seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/urarL3t8/1/
[06:00:57] <randomguy1> ramsub07: from your fiddle comment, it seems like you want to do an ajax request for the first submit, and then possibly another for the second one, or probably a regular submit for the second one as your apparently trying to download files
[06:01:15] <simonfunk> oh, chrome has outputted a wrong error information, firefox told me that a comma is missing. sorry and thanks
[06:01:33] <randomguy1> ramsub07: but right now your doing multiple submits which i'm sure is causing issues
[06:02:34] <ramsub07> randomguy1: yeah, the second one is fine with me, how to ensure that the clicking of button would submit a form with the value of radio button selected ?
[06:02:34] <simonfunk> ramsub07, i cleaned a little bit the code to check it better: http://jsfiddle.net/hz6ov14m/4/ you're code seems to work and i get the post request. of course, the other submit won't be executed if you don't make it with ajax
[06:02:53] <ramsub07> simonfunk: the second submit works as randomguy1 said
[06:03:19] <ramsub07> but I want a POST request to the URL that is there in action="" when the button is clicked
[06:07:33] <simonfunk> ramsub07, ah, so wait shortly
[06:08:54] <ramsub07> simonfunk: sur
[06:08:55] <ramsub07> *sure
[06:09:17] <simonfunk> ramsub07 http://jsfiddle.net/hz6ov14m/5/ check it, but it's not a good solution anyway
[06:09:57] <simonfunk> cause you make something like an infinity loop, cause you submit in the submit function so you call the function in the function itself again and again
[06:10:25] <randomguy1> ramsub07: i came up with this http://jsfiddle.net/b07megcz/6/  not sure that all the syntax is correct but for an ida
[06:10:28] <randomguy1> ^idea
[06:10:45] <simonfunk> i would recommend to exculde that in functions and interact with ajax
[06:11:49] <simonfunk> ok you grap there twice the submit..
[06:17:10] <simonfunk> ramsub07 this should do the trick: http://jsfiddle.net/hz6ov14m/7/
[06:17:47] <simonfunk> i didn't tested it but from logic it should work ;)
[06:18:46] <randomguy1> the issue with the second ajax call is, if he's expecting that request to do a file download, ajax and file downloads don't work well together
[06:18:59] <randomguy1> from my understanding
[06:20:47] <simonfunk> yea but then you could give back the filename and path open that in a new windows to download
[06:21:15] <randomguy1> true
[06:22:02] <ramsub07> simonfunk: thanks, this should be inside $(document).ready(function() right ?
[06:23:09] <simonfunk> ramsub07 yeph except the function. function definitions can also be outside
[06:23:43] <simonfunk> maybe you also need to add a e.preventDefault at the end
[06:23:46] <Sal> can someone tell me whats wrong with this: http://i.imgur.com/dJG9t3r.png
[06:23:58] <Sal> the div doesn't get the correct width
[06:24:14] <Sal> it just cuts on content width
[06:24:30] <delboy1978uk> check display isnt inline
[06:24:30] <simonfunk> Sal try css('left')
[06:25:18] <Sal> simonfunk, left?
[06:25:24] <Sal> i have problems with width
[06:25:31] <Sal> left is positioning well
[06:25:37] <Sal> delboy1978uk, was that for me?
[06:25:47] <delboy1978uk> yeah
[06:25:48] <BillCriswell> Sal Did you set display inline?
[06:25:54] <Sal> no
[06:25:56] <BillCriswell> Oh, delboy1978uk  already asked that.
[06:25:59] <Sal> its that?
[06:25:59] <delboy1978uk> inline boxes just have a width the size of the content
[06:26:01] <Sal> let me try
[06:26:22] <delboy1978uk> try inline-block or block
[06:26:22] <Sal> oh, no, mine isn't inline
[06:26:29] <BillCriswell> Also, make sure abW isn't 0.
[06:26:34] <Sal> its just a diso i think default is block
[06:26:36] <Sal> right?
[06:26:40] <delboy1978uk> it is
[06:26:50] <Sal> abW isn't zero
[06:27:00] <Sal> i debugged it and saw the right value in it
[06:27:14] <BillCriswell> Are you sure thisSubHeader is what you think it is?
[06:27:39] <randomguy1> a fiddle would be nice
[06:27:48] <BillCriswell> Oh you said left was working... well the issue isn't that code.
[06:27:53] <delboy1978uk> yeah make a jsbin.com paste
[06:28:21] <delboy1978uk> jsbin is nicer than jsfiddle imho
[06:28:25] <Sal> none
[06:28:46] <Sal> no block, inline-block or inline change it
[06:28:57] <Sal> seems that its not getting the width
[06:29:09] <Sal> i looked inside dt, and didn0t see any width assigned
[06:29:40] <Sal> do i need to assign an initial balue to width?
[06:29:46] <BillCriswell> No.
[06:29:47] <Sal> balue=value
[06:30:19] <Sal> these are the classes: http://i.imgur.com/C2KPLZX.png
[06:30:25] <Sal> seem normal to me
[06:32:47] <Sal> ok, the problem is that jquesry is not assigning the width
[06:33:05] <Sal> because if i put the width manually using tools, it works
[06:33:17] <Sal> does anyone know why jauqery is doing this?
[06:33:56] <Sal> should i use widyh(n) instead of css?
[06:35:27] <BillCriswell> widyh
[06:35:28] <BillCriswell> ?
[06:35:31] <BillCriswell> Oh, lol
[06:35:33] <BillCriswell> typo.
[06:35:40] <Sal> :)
[06:35:40] <BillCriswell> Sal: http://jsbin.com/cojobi/1/edit?html,css,js,output your code is fine, there's something else.
[06:35:59] <Sal> hmmm
[06:37:36] <Sal> hmm, its in a scroll event handler... so maybe some code could change things
[06:37:41] <Sal> let me check better
[06:37:42] <Sal> thanks
[06:37:52] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[06:43:57] <Wes-> Is there a way to tell jquery-ui to use a better number-picker in the date-picker?  The select boxes really suck on touch screen
[06:47:28] <delboy1978uk> no. you would do that in CSS
[06:49:40] <Wes-> delboy1978uk: So, "no".  I don't want differently-looking select boxes, I want to use something other than select boxes.
[06:50:17] <delboy1978uk> oh. you probably want to extend the existing code then. maybe someone has written a plugin alread yfor this>?
[06:50:20] <Wes-> Hm. I wonder how hard it would be to add a render hook to the datepicker so I can pound some new DOM in there
[06:51:02] <Wes->  delboy1978uk: Hm, good thinking. *googling*
[06:52:03] <delboy1978uk> this guy is doing some interesting stuff http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[06:52:15] <delboy1978uk> adding functionality - a timepicker!
[06:52:38] <delboy1978uk> https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon
[06:53:02] <randomguy1> i was thinking for touch screen, making the dates a vertical spinner would be interesting
[06:53:07] <Wes-> delboy1978uk: Not bad, getting in the right direction
[06:53:13] <Wes-> randomguy1: I was thinking the same thing
[06:53:40] <Wes-> Maybe I should do a momentum-scrolling version of <SELECT> that just goes and marks up the DOM at load time  (and also datepicker render time)
[07:28:21] <delboy1978uk> ok how can i give this alert a delay of say 3 seconds before appearing? http://jsbin.com/latonedivo/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:33:00] <Fogest> delboy1978uk, setTimeout

[07:40:16] <d[10]> https://jsfiddle.net/0mjww2kz/ why ?
[07:40:55] <Tennis> the remaining a's?
[07:41:25] <d[10]> Tennis: ?
[07:42:02] <Tennis> I was enquiring into your cryptics
[07:42:05] <Tennis> why what?
[07:42:10] <Tennis> the remaining a's?
[07:43:41] <dsockwell> I have a potential XSS vulnerability of the form $(window.location.hash).find('.static_class_string').click()
[07:44:07] <dsockwell> Is there any way for a selector derived from window.location.hash to bypass the find statement if the selector there is hard coded?
[07:44:35] <Tennis> https://jsfiddle.net/0mjww2kz/1/ thats my quick fix :P
[07:46:34] <dsockwell> alternately, is there a way to introduce an element within the jQuery() call by appending to a string that begins with '#' ?
[07:49:57] <d[10]> Tennis: open, wait!
[07:51:43] <delboy1978uk> hi again guys. i’m rather shit at debugging javascript in firebug, can anyone help? i have a ‘show shopping cart’ button which brings a popup window into focus. i need to find the bit of code that triggers when its clicked
[07:52:11] <delboy1978uk> dsockwell: like $(‘#’+element_name_here);
[07:52:15] <delboy1978uk> sure
[07:52:53] <dsockwell> delboy1978uk: but then element_name_here would need to be of class 'static_class_string' to be click()'d, right?
[07:53:46] <Tennis> class id or element
[07:54:30] <Tennis> ctrl+f "#id" , ".class" , "span"
[07:54:39] <Tennis> firebugs great
[07:54:52] <dsockwell> oh
[07:54:57] <dsockwell> coder used that class for everything
[07:55:00] <dsockwell> thanks, guy
[07:55:54] <delboy1978uk> isnt there a way of stepping through code like xdebug does for php? you know, setting breakpoints etc?
[07:56:06] <dsockwell> yeah i'm using that right now
[07:56:08] <spyyke> there certainly is
[07:56:09] <dsockwell> in firebug
[07:56:21] <dsockwell> open the scripts tab, right click your script, and set a breakpoint
[07:56:30] <dsockwell> it's got the eclipse buttons for step into, step over, etc
[07:56:34] <delboy1978uk> ok i’ll give it a try
[07:56:38] <delboy1978uk> cool
[07:56:49] <delboy1978uk> eclipse sucks though lol, i love phpstorm
[07:57:17] <delboy1978uk> which is the same as pycharm for python or intellij for java
[07:57:53] <delboy1978uk> haha ive never noticed the ability to set breakpoints before!
[07:58:29] <dsockwell> it wouldn't deserve 'bug' in its name without debugger features
[07:58:37] <dsockwell> check out the stack and watch-expression stuff too
[07:59:20] <delboy1978uk> watch expression, that sounds like what i need
[07:59:29] <delboy1978uk> i’m interested in a.view-minicart
[08:00:03] <delboy1978uk> dsockwell: good point about the name lol

[08:24:26] <delboy1978uk> thanks guys
[08:24:44] <robertmaxrees> you could do (function($) { /* your code here */ }(jQuery))
[08:24:48] <robertmaxrees> and then $ will work again.
[08:27:30] <NonSecwitter> If WebForms makes an Ajax request and I get a 504 error, would that be a symptom of the data store not responding quickly enough?
[08:28:09] <robertmaxrees> http://www.checkupdown.com/status/E504.html NonSecwitter
[08:28:24] <robertmaxrees> basically, yes.
[08:28:26] <NonSecwitter> I read that
[08:28:27] <NonSecwitter> Okay
[08:28:44] <delboy1978uk> yup its definitely a conflict
[08:28:54] <delboy1978uk> i added $ = jQuery.noConflict();
[08:29:01] <robertmaxrees> that's... weird.
[08:29:01] <NonSecwitter> Same system, different problem... reports aren't reporting
[08:29:13] <truda> hey
[08:29:18] <delboy1978uk> now i get this: 	element.dispatchEvent(event);
[08:29:22] <NonSecwitter> I don't know whether the SQL server and IIS are hosted on the same system
[08:29:24] <delboy1978uk> as an error in the console
[08:29:27] <truda> how do I clear the queue of an element using .queue()?
[08:29:36] <delboy1978uk> coming from a prototype script
[08:29:45] <arthurvr> truda: if you really want to use .queue() you can alwayse pass an array as second argument: $('#el').queue('name', []). Though I'd suggest you to use .clearQueue('name') which does the same but clearly expresses your intent.
[08:29:56] <robertmaxrees> delboy1978uk that means you need to leave noConflict mode on
[08:30:12] <robertmaxrees> you could assign your own replacement for $, or wrap your code in the IIFE i showed above so you can use $ again
[08:30:19] <truda> is arthurvr a bot or just fast as hell?
[08:30:24] <arthurvr> beep beep
[08:30:25] <robertmaxrees> fast as hell :)
[08:30:34] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr the boy wonder.
[08:30:51] <truda> any recommended articles on custom queues?
[08:31:00] <arthurvr> http://learn.jquery.com/effects/queue-and-dequeue-explained/
[08:31:03] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: lol :p
[08:31:07] <robertmaxrees> ++
[08:31:16] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr makes me wonder wtf i was doing when i was a teenager.
[08:31:46] <NonSecwitter> WOW!... An error occurred during local report processing.
[08:31:47] <NonSecwitter>  An error has occurred during report processing.
[08:31:47] <NonSecwitter>  Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.
[08:31:47] <NonSecwitter>  
[08:31:47] <NonSecwitter>  
[08:31:53] <NonSecwitter> sorry
[08:31:56] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[08:31:57] <NonSecwitter> didn't mean to do that
[08:32:05] <truda> is it a good article or you just because it's the official document robertmaxrees arthurvr?
[08:32:14] <robertmaxrees> truda it's both
[08:32:35] <arthurvr> I wrote it so that’s why I suggested this one :lollipop:
[08:33:44] <truda> arthurvr: thanks :)
[08:33:49] <truda> thanks everyone!
[08:33:52] <truda> other q?
[08:34:02] <arthurvr> Totally feel free.
[08:34:38] <robertmaxrees> s'why we're here.
[08:35:37] <DietDrK> http://jsfiddle.net/cyysg630/ works on Chrome but not on IE. When rectangle is clicked the form on the bottom should be populated with the text of the SVG element, not the default 'stuff'. How to fix this?
[08:36:13] <truda> what are common jQuery performance pitfalls? I have been trying to improve perf for really long now.
[08:36:24] <robertmaxrees> truda are you having performance problems?
[08:36:38] <truda> no just wondering in general where I should be aware of
[08:36:40] <arthurvr> I think you should use the tools and don't ask for rules.
[08:36:49] <arthurvr>  Though be aware of big doms, :hidden (and similar), don't act on absent elements, append outside of loops, ... the classical things ya know.
[08:36:56] <NoiseEee> caching selectors or repeated elements for manipulation goes a long way truda
[08:37:34] <DietDrK> are one of the selectors in the javascript not allowed?
[08:37:38] <decx> dont do heavy lifting on rapid fireevents like mousemove/resize/scroll
[08:37:47] <robertmaxrees> code for readability at first.  don't prematurely optimize in general.
[08:37:53] <robertmaxrees> DietDrK huh?
[08:38:00] <arthurvr> yea NoiseEee and decx++. the classic (but important!) things. Though if you have problems analyize using serious tools instead of learning many of those rules by hard.
[08:38:13] <arthurvr> jQuery specific selectors too
[08:38:36] <DietDrK> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/cyysg630/ if you click on "Dog" and look at the box, the text input will be populated with "Dog" in Chrome. Not so in IE.
[08:39:24] <DietDrK> I feel like this isn't firing in JS: var NodeName = $(this).parents().children('text').html();
[08:39:28] <robertmaxrees> DietDrK you're aware you're not using fiddle right, yeah?
[08:39:29] <truda> where do I find those tools?
[08:39:35] <robertmaxrees> truda the api docs ;)
[08:39:42] <arthurvr> those, as well :)
[08:39:42] <DietDrK> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[08:39:43] <robertmaxrees> DietDrK start here: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cyysg630/3/
[08:39:49] <decx> old ie doesnt have the placeholder attribute
[08:39:57] <arthurvr> and your profiler/timeline in devtools
[08:40:04] <DietDrK> Very cool!
[08:40:15] <truda> timeline?
[08:40:26] <arthurvr> truda: what browser are you using?
[08:40:33] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com truda
[08:40:41] <truda> chrome
[08:40:49] <arthurvr> hit command shift + I and magic happens
[08:40:50] <DietDrK> robertmaxrees: on http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cyysg630/3/ the <input type=text" doesn't work correctly on IE in JSFiddle.
[08:41:19] <truda> the window at the bottom?
[08:41:30] <DietDrK> ok. I replaced line 12 with var NodeName='words'; and it will reset it to words. that means that it must be a problem with the parents().children() line.
[08:41:31] <arthurvr> yes sir! No go do some good reading about devtools. They rock.
[08:42:16] <truda> where do I find good reads?
[08:42:26] <arthurvr> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools and #chrome-devtools :)
[08:42:38] <DietDrK> I suppose there is a problem with using $(element).html() for getting a value in IE, yeah?
[08:42:56] <decx> might just be ie being stubborn with svg
[08:42:57] <robertmaxrees> iirc IE and SVG is always a weird combo.
[08:43:09] <DietDrK> seems that <text> isn't a valid tag. I need to think of a workaround.
[08:43:12] <b-ot> DietDrK: No output.
[08:43:27] <DietDrK> b-ot: what do you mean?
[08:43:28] <b-ot> DietDrK: it is certain.
[08:43:32] <robertmaxrees> it's a bot ;)
[08:43:33] <decx> try children('text')[0].textContent
[08:43:53] <arthurvr> DietDrK: excuse our buggy bot :p
[08:44:12] <decx> i dont even know what prefix i have to use anymore with the b-ot
[08:44:32] <arthurvr> decx: don’t the normal things work anymore?
[08:44:34] <arthurvr> ?api html
[08:44:34] <b-ot> arthurvr: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[08:44:34] <decx> is it `, ? or something new
[08:44:37] <arthurvr> `api html
[08:44:39] <b-ot> arthurvr: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[08:44:44] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ arthurvr
[08:44:47] <robertmaxrees> !paste
[08:44:48] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:44:53] <decx> i could've sworn ` didnt work the other day
[08:44:54] <robertmaxrees> the @ setup broke.
[08:44:54] <arthurvr> all still works no?
[08:45:02] <decx> `ftj
[08:45:02] <b-ot> decx: Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[08:45:08] <arthurvr> decx: b-ot was down for a long time
[08:45:09] <DietDrK> children('text')[0].textContent works!
[08:45:18] <DietDrK> now... that seems strange.
[08:45:20] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr we used to have the !paste @ person setup
[08:45:36] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: arg is it broken?
[08:45:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[08:45:41] <arthurvr> `paste @ robertmaxrees
[08:45:46] <arthurvr> yeah seems like it.
[08:46:04] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: any idea who generally fixes things regarding the b-ot?
[08:46:16] <arthurvr> I’ll ping somebody if you want that
[08:46:18] <robertmaxrees> I think it's gnarf's?  i could be wrong though.
[08:46:43] <decx> ?delegate
[08:46:45] <decx> ^^
[08:46:46] <robertmaxrees> i can always bug them about it if need be.  i just hate buggin' y'all
[08:46:51] <DietDrK> Ok. So that works. children('text')[0].textContent; Where can I go to read about why?
[08:47:12] <decx> cant believe it worked
[08:47:19] <decx> and html() didnt
[08:47:27] <DietDrK> How did you guess that?
[08:47:28] <decx> oh well, bottoms up
[08:47:44] <robertmaxrees> DietDrK svg and html aren't the same thing.
[08:47:44] <decx> just a guess
[08:47:47] <decx> right
[08:47:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery is primarily for html.
[08:48:01] <DietDrK> Should I look for another tool?
[08:48:50] <robertmaxrees> check out the various plugins for it maybe?
[08:48:56] <robertmaxrees> or just learn the actual DOM APIs for it.
[08:49:04] <decx> so html() only didnt work in ie then?
[08:49:22] <DietDrK> decx: correct... and android 2.x default browser
[08:49:29] <robertmaxrees> which is basically chrome.
[08:49:48] <DietDrK> at first I thought it was because <polygon ... /> vs <polygon.... > </polygon>
[08:49:54] <decx> imho html() should normalize across browsers, we should investigate
[08:50:04] <decx> svg or not
[08:50:28] <DietDrK> I read online one sentence: "<text> is not a valid tag, so IE stops reading it and JS never sees it"
[08:50:32] <b-ot> DietDrK: No output.
[08:50:33] <DietDrK> Something to that a/effect
[08:51:16] <DietDrK> Should I treat this as a 'gotcha' and quirk of IE/HTML and move on?
[08:51:28] <decx> if you want to be productive yes
[08:51:33] <decx> blame ie, save time
[08:52:02] <arthurvr> The day you drop off support for IE (even the latest version) is sooo beautiful by the way
[08:52:10] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[08:52:16] <robertmaxrees> so much hate in here ;)_
[08:52:48] <decx> hate is such a strong word
[08:52:57] <arthurvr> Actually IE isn’t the worst anymore. Safari is being sooo stupid lately
[08:53:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:53:06] <robertmaxrees> this all day.
[08:53:09] <decx> safari? ... disgust, now there's a fitting word
[08:53:24] <decx> or new ie as we call it here
[08:53:33] <DietDrK> would it be appropriate to just design for Chrome?
[08:53:46] <decx> if you dont like money
[08:54:18] <decx> ff all day tho
[08:54:26] <DietDrK> I think I'm almost done with the GUI stuff
[08:54:26] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[08:54:30] <robertmaxrees> i can't ++ harder.
[08:54:31] <DietDrK> So hopefully not too many more IE gotchas
[08:54:39] <DietDrK> everything else is C++/PHP
[08:54:54] <robertmaxrees> DietDrK that's why we use jq - it generally smooths out those differences.
[08:54:56] <sloowmo> robertmaxrees: decx: you use ff for development?
[08:55:05] <robertmaxrees> i do yeah
[08:55:12] <decx> why wouldnt i, it's awesome
[08:56:07] <sloowmo> who do others use? Isn't chrome the most popular?
[08:56:20] <robertmaxrees> chrome's really popular.  IE11's dev tools are surprisingly good these days.
[08:56:28] <robertmaxrees> FF has gotten really good imo.
[08:56:28] <arthurvr> dunno what’s the most popular but I use opera or chrome.
[08:56:47] <robertmaxrees> sloowmo it's all about what "feels" best to you.
[08:57:08] <arthurvr> FF is really good (also the devtools) I just feel like I spent days learning the chrome devtools in detail so I can’t imagine switching these days
[08:57:27] <decx> my market is also 40-50% ff users (germany)
[08:57:34] <robertmaxrees> decx that's... interesting.
[08:57:34] <sloowmo> OPERA? nooooo
[08:57:45] <robertmaxrees> sloowmo opera is just chrome these days.
[08:57:52] <arthurvr> yes totally yes it’s chrome but clean
[08:58:06] <arthurvr> It’s like google chrome but without the google :p
[08:58:21] <robertmaxrees> decx have you tried FF with E10S yet?
[08:58:40] <decx> i'm fine with single process
[08:58:49] <decx> if it's anything like chrome
[08:58:56] <robertmaxrees> i was, and then i tried multi.  it's a whole new browser.
[08:58:59] <decx> them overhead
[08:59:01] <robertmaxrees> still a little buggy.
[08:59:50] <arthurvr> I feel like the last new things in chrome were all useless (not to say I totally dislike them)
[08:59:58] <decx> i'll give it a go when it's matured a bit more
[09:00:13] <decx> yeah chrome a few years ago was great
[09:00:32] <decx> only thing getting better is the devtools
[09:00:38] <decx> twoedged sword
[09:00:57] <arthurvr> array methods are still the slowest things ever in chromium but they just tend to ignore those things and build new features
[09:00:57] <samssh> robertmaxrees, Have you dove at FF x64 yet?
[09:01:03] <samssh> dived?
[09:01:12] <robertmaxrees> *dove into
[09:01:19] <decx> it's obviously duff
[09:01:21] <samssh> *tried
[09:01:30] <robertmaxrees> and i'm on dev edition, so i'm not sure.
[09:01:39] <samssh> I can't even speak my first language. No wonder I never learned a second...
[09:02:12] <samssh> You have to do a full install, 64bit doesn't come down the pipe on its own.
[09:02:22] <robertmaxrees> ah, then no.
[09:02:58] <samssh> I like to run FF dev for actual dev work, and FF stable for browsing.
[09:03:16] <robertmaxrees> i just use FF for everything.  i actually kind of prefer the theme.
[09:03:36] <truda> In chrome canary is stable enough to use all day someone told me
[09:03:42] <arthurvr> truda: years ago that was true
[09:04:15] <rindolf> Hi all.
[09:04:21] <arthurvr> hey rindolf
[09:04:30] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[09:04:56] <samssh> I tend to do media stuff in Chrome. Like Pandora. Used to use Grooveshark, may it RIP.
[09:05:31] <robertmaxrees> i use chrome mostly for stuff that's going to be open all the time and for google webapps like gmail and calendar.
[09:05:33] <robertmaxrees> that's about it.
[09:06:21] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: just wondering are google webapps any better on chrome than they are on firefox?
[09:06:45] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr i've found that's generally the case.
[09:06:55] <arthurvr> no surprise
[09:06:56] <samssh> robertmaxrees, In what ways? Faster?
[09:06:57] <arthurvr> though sad
[09:06:58] <robertmaxrees> they're just a tad smoother in chrome.
[09:07:13] <samssh> I like FF pin tabs for Gmail at home.
[09:10:34] <decx> i never used gmail
[09:10:45] <decx> thunderbird evrry day
[09:11:38] <arthurvr> I love gmail. Can’t use it all day due to school things :(
[09:11:49] <robertmaxrees> when i was handling loads of email, outlook was my lord and savior.
[09:12:08] <decx> well i still use gmail for the space but i have all my taskstuff in thunderbird
[09:12:50] <decx> might be worth changing workflows at some point, people keep saying how awesome google integration on the new android is
[09:13:00] <robertmaxrees> very.
[09:15:52] <sloowmo> how does jQuery work together with SVG?
[09:15:59] <robertmaxrees> not very well.
[09:16:09] <hlvwrk> in what sense?
[09:16:25] <arthurvr> well you might be surprised by https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/20aaed367f993f3c2aa204183d82d0d73efa114f
[09:16:28] <decx> svg is a fickle beast
[09:16:39] <robertmaxrees> ^ arthurvr++
[09:16:43] <arthurvr> but for the time being that’s the only thing
[09:16:47] <robertmaxrees> the issue is SVG isn't really HTML.
[09:16:56] <robertmaxrees> jquery is primarily for HTML DOM, right?
[09:17:39] <decx> neat
[09:17:56] <arthurvr> http://contribute.jquery.org/wont-fix/#svg-vml-or-namespaced-elements-bugs is our stance at it
[09:18:14] <robertmaxrees> boom
[09:18:14] <arthurvr> ++ to robertmaxrees. jQuery is about HTML DOM.
[09:19:00] <arc_> is svg also something else other than scalable vector graphics
[09:19:10] <NoiseEee> no arc_
[09:19:23] <arc_> then i guess i must just have no idea how that format works
[09:19:29] <NoiseEee> its XML
[09:19:35] <arc_> i see
[09:19:44] <robertmaxrees> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics - "Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation."
[09:20:15] <arc_> does anyone actually use this for interactivity
[09:20:26] <decx> the format is surprisingly adept at a lot of stuff
[09:20:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:20:39] <arc_> any examples you know of that you could link?
[09:20:46] <arthurvr> gotta leave. Have fun over here
[09:20:49] <decx> d3.js
[09:20:55] <decx> bye arthurvr
[09:21:00] <arthurvr> bye decx
[09:21:18] <NoiseEee> arc_: sure, all the time. http://snapsvg.io/ is a great lib
[09:21:33] <decx> is snap really that good?
[09:21:47] <decx> i've been using native js in the few instances i had to deal with svg
[09:21:51] <arc_> lol, crazy
[09:22:23] <NoiseEee> snap is helpful, yep
[09:22:32] <NoiseEee> depends on what you're doing i guess
[09:22:38] <decx> gotta come up with something to use it for
[09:22:40] <decx> ^^
[09:22:43] <arc_> it'd be nice if all non-photographic content were done in svg
[09:22:58] <decx> eh
[09:23:03] <decx> lossy png is pretty awesome
[09:23:38] <arc_> yeah but then you have to do dpi scaling stuff
[09:24:12] <arc_> with svg it doesn't matter the dpi of the screen, it always looks native resolution
[09:24:23] <decx> you'd be surprised how little that matters to endusers
[09:24:34] <arc_> oh i'm sure it doesn't
[09:24:36] <arc_> but it matters to me :p
[09:24:36] <DietDrK> Should I go somewhere else for JQuery Mobile help?
[09:24:39] <decx> haha
[09:24:54] <decx> no here is okay
[09:25:09] <DietDrK> You guys are so peachy.
[09:25:21] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[09:25:22] <decx> you peaked when i was in the shower huh
[09:25:32] <randomguy1> i prefer to be marioy
[09:25:49] <decx> is that an adjective?
[09:25:56] <randomguy1> is now
[09:26:07] <decx> when you have a mustache and where a red overall
[09:26:14] <randomguy1> lol
[09:26:15] <decx> wear
[09:26:19] <decx> the brainfart
[09:26:35] <decx> now i know how "should of" happens
[09:28:06] <DietDrK> for the jquery mobile popup in http://jsfiddle.net/j7uznjh2/ , the popup changes width according to the selection because <input type='text'> is wider than other elements. Is there a way to set the width up to the maximum width element off the bat so it doesn't change as selections are made?
[09:29:34] <decx> huh
[09:29:44] <randomguy1> you could set a min-width for the container
[09:30:03] <DietDrK> and then I'd inspect it on the highest width and set that as the minimum by hand?
[09:30:11] <decx> when does it change width?
[09:30:15] <decx> i dont see it
[09:30:21] <DietDrK> click "Add Child Node"
[09:30:28] <DietDrK> and then "Delete Node"
[09:30:48] <decx> ah
[09:30:50] <decx> subtle
[09:31:38] <randomguy1> i'm assuming your showing and hiding the inner inputs?
[09:31:44] <DietDrK> That's right.
[09:31:57] <randomguy1> alternatively you could set their height to 0 so their width still effects the container
[09:32:03] <randomguy1> might be 'dirty' though
[09:32:04] <DietDrK> Radiobox selection dictates which child inputs are shown.
[09:32:14] <DietDrK> Oh, that sounds interesting.
[09:33:35] <DietDrK> I think perhaps .outerWidth() might solve my problem.
[09:33:49] <decx> you shouldnt need js for that
[09:33:51] <decx> it's a css thing
[09:33:58] <jayjo> I'm trying to update a input value for many fields, and I'm doing it with a class to try and get them all changed at once. Is there a way to do that with classes or do they each need ids?
[09:33:58] <robertmaxrees> ^ yep
[09:34:18] <decx> val has its own each
[09:34:42] <DietDrK> I was thinking of .outerWidth() on all elements in form, then setting a coveted INLINE STYLE to the popup window to set its width to the maximum element.outerWidth()
[09:34:51] <robertmaxrees> DietDrK don't do that.
[09:35:17] <decx> jayjo: http://jsfiddle.net/kgrbkkc9/
[09:35:19] <jayjo> decx: right, so I have multiple inputs, can I give them all a class and change all of the values?
[09:35:23] <jayjo> ok
[09:35:39] <decx> all to the same value?
[09:35:41] <DietDrK> then perhaps I'll make a pHide() function which sets the height to 0 on everything, and have a pShow() function which sets it back to normal?
[09:35:44] <decx> then you dont even need the function
[09:36:46] <randomguy1> DietDrK: http://jsfiddle.net/j7uznjh2/1/
[09:37:35] <DietDrK> randomguy1: I had to increase the number to ~210 for it to be consistent
[09:37:42] <randomguy1> boom
[09:37:48] <DietDrK> Anyways, I suppose that's a number I could do by hand
[09:37:50] <DietDrK> I appreciate it
[09:39:17] <DietDrK> Hm... doesn't work well with inlight CSS
[09:39:21] <decx> alternatively http://jsfiddle.net/j7uznjh2/3/
[09:39:54] <DietDrK> decx: that one still changes the width when selecting Edit/Delete node
[09:40:02] <DietDrK> You're using Chrome, yeah?
[09:40:10] <decx> oh it doesnt in ff
[09:40:18] <decx> disregard that then i suck cocks
[09:40:25] <DietDrK> noted
[09:40:33] <randomguy1> wow
[09:41:01] <sillyslux> just joined.. sounds funny here, whats going on?
[09:41:17] <decx> vintage memeing
[09:41:25] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[09:41:28] <robertmaxrees> oldschool
[09:41:31] <randomguy1> decx started describing some of his past times.  and no one asked
[09:42:00] <robertmaxrees> http://bash.org/?5775
[09:42:08] <DietDrK> http://bash.org/?5775
[09:42:14] <DietDrK> no timestamp on that guy?
[09:42:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:42:40] <decx> i have one quote on bash
[09:42:47] <decx> from like 10 years ago
[09:42:48] <robertmaxrees> they asked you to not include timestamps on quotes.
[09:43:05] <robertmaxrees> decx++ sennheister
[09:43:09] <robertmaxrees> *sennheiser
[09:43:28] <sillyslux> :D
[09:43:36] <DietDrK> I just wonder what year it was added
[09:43:46] <robertmaxrees> DietDrK many ago.
[09:44:06] <DietDrK> I remember seeing that at least 10 years ago.
[09:45:17] <DietDrK> decx: keep at it
[09:45:22] <gooddesignusa> Does anyone know of a plugin to transform one DOM element in to another with an animation. I swear I saw the plugin the other day but can't seem to find it today :( I think it is somewhat new
[09:45:34] <decx> yeah i remember that
[09:45:37] <decx> was on hn frontpage
[09:45:43] <decx> but i couldnt find it agaibn
[09:45:55] <DietDrK> the 'site codes itself while you watch' one?
[09:45:57] <decx> the transformation was pretty smooth too
[09:46:00] <gooddesignusa> ok so I am not going crazy ;p I've been looking for an hour now
[09:46:01] <decx> no
[09:46:11] <decx> it spleened containers into another container
[09:46:19] <decx> like in the old flash days
[09:46:23] <gooddesignusa> yeah
[09:46:32] <decx> if you find it again post it here
[09:46:35] <gooddesignusa> I thought I saw it on jqueryrain but I went through 20 pages
[09:46:37] <decx> i was looking for it too the other day
[09:47:08] <Es0teric> how do i target a element inside an iframe?
[09:47:41] <gooddesignusa> I've searched for a buch of different things but couldn't find it. Transform element into another, etc
[09:47:54] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric .contents()
[09:48:04] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric assuming CORS isn't a problem.
[09:48:09] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees it shouldnt be
[09:48:12] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/contents/
[09:48:38] <gooddesignusa> decx: what website did you think you saw it. I will go through all the past posts and try to find it
[09:49:04] <robertmaxrees> https://news.ycombinator.com/ gooddesignusa
[09:49:04] <decx> http://news.ycombinator.com
[09:49:07] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[09:49:13] <gooddesignusa> Ah yeah thats the one I think I saw it on!
[09:50:54] <gooddesignusa> found it!
[09:50:59] <robertmaxrees> linky
[09:51:28] <gooddesignusa> I think I had it bookmarked too but the the plugin had a weird name. Ramjet
[09:51:46] <gooddesignusa> http://www.rich-harris.co.uk/ramjet/
[09:51:59] <decx> yeah that's the one
[09:52:02] <decx> nice
[09:52:04] <gooddesignusa> I did have it bookmarked. WTF, way to much time wasted!
[09:52:11] <decx> well you helped me out
[09:52:17] <decx> has been bugging me for days
[09:52:19] <gooddesignusa> I would of never found it if you didn't remember where you saw it
[09:52:29] <decx> socialism !
[09:52:41] <gooddesignusa> I wonder how it will work with an image to an iframe of a youtube video
[09:53:03] <randomguy2> wut
[10:04:03] <arc_> i found the best website
[10:04:05] <arc_> http://www.remcographics.com/
[10:04:26] <randomguy2> please don't link porn sites...
[10:04:43] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:04:54] <DietDrK> As someone who does business in China... lol
[10:05:03] <randomguy2> he said it was a 'best' site.  i just assumed...
[10:05:25] <Uhkis> randomguy2 has weird definition of porn
[10:05:27] <arc_> sfw, nsfl
[10:05:34] <randomguy2> don't judge me!
[10:05:54] <arc_> i'm not sure how long it's been since i saw a "website" that was completely done in flash
[10:05:59] <arc_> also, look at the page title
[10:06:04] <Uhkis> whatever gets you going lol
[10:06:22] <DietDrK> I know who made this
[10:06:26] <DietDrK> Adama
[10:06:28] <DietDrK> I can tell by the style
[10:07:00] <DietDrK> calls herself Dr. Adama
[10:07:30] <DietDrK> she did the same thing in Guangzhou until she started teaching at another school in ShenZhen
[10:07:42] <arc_> i mean ... it says right in the about page who made it
[10:08:44] <randomguy2> doesn't really scale well, or at all, for wide screens
[10:09:12] <DietDrK> Chinese graphics companies don't really operate under their own company name if it's hosted outside of Mainland China
[10:09:58] <randomguy2> and holy cow that's a long page title
[10:10:09] <DietDrK> 23.141281, 113.344482 is the 'software center' of southern China
[10:10:13] <DietDrK> but you won't find any sites they made
[10:10:48] <randomguy2> woah!
[10:11:01] <randomguy2> read that title, death stuff...
[10:11:41] <DietDrK> " Praise the Lord Jesus Christ...The Son of the Living God and ONLY God!!, INSTANT DEATH TO ALL ISLAMIC AND MUSLIM EXTREMISTS AND INSTANT AND IMMEDIATE DEATH TO ALL ISIS MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES...AND I MEAN INSTANT!!!, Mess with the U.S. and meet your maker"
[10:11:51] <robertmaxrees> welp
[10:12:25] <DietDrK> I feel like they should have declared UTF-8 before going on that rant.
[10:12:31] <randomguy2> lmao
[10:14:05] <DietDrK> "$2000 minimum payment amount for the first exclusive meeting with a company in mainland China" <--- marco polo syndrome to the max
[10:14:59] <sillyslux> "peoples republic of" china... is that an official slogan?
[10:15:33] <DietDrK> Republic of China= Taiwan
[10:16:11] <DietDrK> South Korea= Republic of Korea, North Korea= Democratic People's Republic of Korea
[10:16:23] <sillyslux> that complicates things a little..
[10:16:46] <DietDrK> Take note... if you add "Peoples'" to your country's title, you probably have limited internet resources and need to design for IE6
[10:17:36] <sillyslux> that makes it a little easier to understand ^^
[10:17:41] <randomguy2> i feel the "people" part is unnecessary.  i mean, what else is there?  Democratic Martian's Republic of Korea I could understand, and be interested in
[10:18:01] <Uhkis> so taiwan doesnt have people :-D
[10:18:09] <randomguy2> or i guess you could do with an animal of some kind
[10:18:17] <DietDrK> ie6, a peoples' browser
[10:20:11] <randomguy2> lol, 0.92% of the market share.  still hanging on
[10:21:20] <DietDrK> It's also big in South Korea because of banking
[10:21:31] <DietDrK> Can't buy things on Taobao in China without IE6
[10:21:50] <DietDrK> or their spinoff- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360_Secure_Browser
[10:22:13] <DietDrK> I'm just happy I don't have to be compatable with that stuff anymore
[10:22:31] <randomguy2> "The high usage numbers are in large part due to the software being very difficult to uninstall. "
[10:23:12] <DietDrK> bank of china, china construction bank, ICBC all require IE6 for internet banking
[10:23:26] <randomguy2> someone needs to inform those people about vms
[10:23:31] <DietDrK> I just spent 11 years there
[10:24:09] <randomguy2> guess i'm in the dark.  what's the security reason for forcing ie6?
[10:24:33] <DietDrK> everyone uses GhostXP. IE6 is as high as it goes or something
[10:24:45] <robertmaxrees> randomguy2 it's more about the fact that most people haven't upgraded their computers from XP
[10:24:52] <robertmaxrees> cost/etc are factors.
[10:25:15] <DietDrK> Ghost7 is $1 at the coordinates I posted, but nobody likes reinstalls, nobody knows how to upgrade an OS there
[10:25:25] <randomguy2> :(
[10:25:38] <DietDrK> and external hard drives are very difficult to buy there. easier to go to HK than buy it in GZ/SZ
[10:26:11] <randomguy2> and not knowing how to upgrade would also play a part in not switching to say a linux flavor too
[10:26:24] <DietDrK> They're pushing out a flavor of linux this year and next
[10:26:34] <DietDrK> Kylin
[10:26:58] <DietDrK> My bad... by 2020
[10:28:43] <randomguy2> look at that, ubuntu stepping up it's game
[10:30:04] <arc_> facebook apparently added gif support. anybody care to guess how?
[10:30:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:30:28] <robertmaxrees> they... display the gif?
[10:30:38] <arc_> sorry, but as obvious as it may seem, no
[10:30:54] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand the question i guess.
[10:30:56] <arc_> it embeds it into a swf
[10:31:34] <arc_> facebook processes every image you post to it, and prior to now, when you post a gif it would just come out as a jpeg
[10:31:40] <arc_> their big solution to that was to process the gif into a swf
[10:31:50] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[10:31:51] <randomguy2> y?
[10:31:54] <arc_> I HAVE NO IDEA
[10:32:00] <arc_> flash is end of life
[10:32:08] <arc_> and it isn't supported on any mobile platform
[10:32:20] <markholmes> twitter's solution is a lot better
[10:32:27] <robertmaxrees> they have a mobile app, so that takes care of that part.
[10:33:11] <arc_> i'm not really sure what they think they're accomplishing with this
[10:33:28] <arc_> i guess they just don't want to allow any way for a user to post a completely unprocessed image
[10:37:48] <ilhami> robertmaxrees, sup?
[10:38:34] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/DCgG what am I doing wrong with the promises here?
[10:41:18] <robertmaxrees> busy duder.
[10:41:20] <robertmaxrees> ask the channel ;)
[10:42:24] <ilhami> heh I did.
[10:44:00] <randomguy2> what is the intent of using the deferred object?
[10:44:22] <ilhami> I want to return it.
[10:44:27] <ilhami> and use it in my other function.
[10:45:55] <randomguy2> well, i'm new to this object, but from https://api.jquery.com/jquery.deferred/ i don't see a listing for promise() and from your code I don't see any attachments of a done() handler
[10:46:09] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/wPUV I didn't post all the code
[10:46:12] <ilhami> check this paste
[10:48:06] <decx> i don't get it
[10:48:14] <randomguy2> ah
[10:48:57] <randomguy2> i think you have an issue with your getId()
[10:49:04] <randomguy2> it returns the id
[10:49:15] <randomguy2> but it won't have an id until a tr is clicked
[10:49:22] <randomguy2> causing the done to process
[10:49:54] <decx> the whole thing doesnt make sense to me but it's been a long week
[10:50:44] <randomguy2> you probably want your deleteEmployee in your done
[10:50:54] <ilhami> randomguy2, yeah lol
[10:50:57] <ilhami> what I was thinking.
[10:51:02] <earational> hey
[10:51:18] <ilhami> but it should work like that anyway. :/ it's weird.
[10:51:39] <randomguy2> also pull your binding out of returnId
[10:52:20] <randomguy2> doesn't bind until you try to return an id
[10:52:32] <randomguy2> and will bind multiple times if you do it like that
[10:53:06] <ilhami> so I can't actually return that id?
[10:53:18] <ilhami> It works when I put the deleteEmployee inside that getId function :P
[10:53:37] <ilhami> I will remove the function then.. :P
[10:53:48] <randomguy2> i'm assuming deleteEmployee can happen multiple times?
[10:54:09] <ilhami> Yeah one at a time :P
[10:54:51] <randomguy2> alright, so you getId(), inside that it gets the promise, which binds to the tr elements, and after a tr is clicked it does it's work
[10:55:13] <randomguy2> next time you call getId() it creates another promise, and double binds on the same parent element
[10:55:26] <randomguy2> and on and on and on
[10:55:53] <ilhami> maybe I misunderstood promises heheh :P
[10:56:09] <ilhami> anyway it works when I put the deleteEmployee in the .done handler
[10:56:18] <robertmaxrees> promises are just a way to handle async operations.
[10:56:39] <decx> i still dont get it, so you want your clicks on tr to give you something?
[10:56:59] <randomguy2> the id to delete
[10:57:01] <randomguy2> it seems
[10:57:07] <decx> well where does that go
[10:57:18] <ilhami> yeah I want that id of the row.
[10:57:23] <ilhami> using datatables.
[10:57:27] <robertmaxrees> ilhami why are you trying to use promises here?
[10:57:46] <ilhami> so I can return the id .
[10:58:05] <decx> but you can just call your function on click
[10:58:06] <ilhami> it works fine now. it's solved.
[10:58:07] <robertmaxrees> this isn't an appropriate use case for that.
[10:58:17] <robertmaxrees> don't use promises/deferreds.
[10:58:23] <robertmaxrees> *in this particular case, i mean.
[10:58:45] <ilhami> I like to have everything in functions. :) and separated
[10:58:51] <robertmaxrees> so use functions.
[10:58:56] <robertmaxrees> don't use deferreds here.
[10:59:04] <ilhami> I don't see a problem.
[10:59:13] <randomguy2> the point here is that the id is readily available.  there is no time delay in retrieving it
[10:59:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:59:32] <ilhami> oh ok.
[10:59:33] <robertmaxrees> deferreds are for async operations.  this isn't really an async operation.
[11:00:11] <decx> see i dont even get how that setup even worked at all so maybe there is some deeper context
[11:01:23] <decx> then again, bye
[11:02:06] <ilhami> it doesn't work when I just return the id.
[11:02:14] <robertmaxrees> because you don't return it./
[11:02:18] <robertmaxrees> you use callbacks in this case.
[11:02:52] <ilhami> so how should I return it?
[11:02:59] <robertmaxrees> you don't
[11:03:10] <randomguy2> in your tr click handler, you have it, so use it
[11:03:43] <ilhami> I want to return it though.
[11:03:53] <robertmaxrees> that's confusing code.
[11:04:08] <robertmaxrees> you're really convoluting click handlers and making things confusing.
[11:04:32] <randomguy2> if your wanting to keep it modular, there is nothing that says by 'using it' you don't pass it to another function
[11:04:43] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:05:11] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/agQX so where would I put the deleteEmployee function?
[11:05:15] <ilhami> call
[11:05:32] <randomguy2> line 19
[11:05:34] <randomguy2> probably
[11:05:43] <robertmaxrees> if (data.id) { getId(data.id) };
[11:06:17] <robertmaxrees> also, your event binding should not be within getId()
[11:06:25] <randomguy2> :)
[11:06:39] <ilhami> can you give me an example or show me how this should be done?
[11:06:48] <decx> gladly
[11:06:57] <randomguy2> 'can' be done
[11:07:01] <randomguy2> many ways to skin a cat
[11:07:09] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/54keb9q/
[11:07:12] <ilhami> it won't work at all if I put the function call on line 19.
[11:07:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:07:34] <robertmaxrees> look at the fixee.
[11:07:55] <decx> what's with the rogue table.
[11:08:09] <robertmaxrees> wait is this a backbone view or something?
[11:08:24] <decx> context ! i knew it
[11:09:07] <ilhami> ok it works now robertmaxrees :D
[11:09:13] <robertmaxrees> I know ;)
[11:09:53] <ilhami> that wasn't too hard :P heh
[11:10:44] <robertmaxrees> you'
[11:10:48] <robertmaxrees> *you're making things too hard.
[11:11:09] <ilhami> yeah I was.
[11:11:35] <randomguy2> *resisting the urge to make a broken promise joke*
[11:11:43] <ilhami> :P
[11:57:55] <walruslt> wazzup
[11:58:18] <walruslt> anyone could helpe me here a little biyt
[11:58:19] <walruslt> bit
[11:58:25] <randomguy2> ask away
[11:58:39] <rindolf> walruslt: hi, I'm fine, blogged about a Vim tip.
[11:59:20] <randomguy2> is the bot in here?
[11:59:22] <randomguy2> !ask
[11:59:22] <b-ot> randomguy2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:59:32] <walruslt> i saw one plugin long long time ago and now i think i need it but i dont remember website where i found it
[12:00:23] <walruslt> the idea of plugin is like
[12:00:38] <walruslt> mind map
[12:01:07] <walruslt> like, i would like to open my website. and then see my project categories as links
[12:01:25] <walruslt> but in mind-map
[12:01:26] <walruslt> way
[12:01:46] <walruslt> there should be links A, B, C
[12:02:02] <walruslt> and they should have strings attached together
[12:02:12] <walruslt> and maybe even move around a little bit
[12:02:23] <walruslt> ?
[12:05:06] <randomguy2> your not talking about this are you? http://drichard.org/mindmaps/
[12:06:31] <randomguy2> related github: https://github.com/drichard/mindmaps
[12:07:26] <walruslt> randomguy2: similar, similar. but elements(boxes) should be links
[12:07:37] <randomguy2> or this one
[12:07:38] <randomguy2> http://kenneth.kufluk.com/google/js-mindmap/
[12:07:57] <randomguy2> github: https://github.com/kennethkufluk/js-mindmap
[12:08:02] <walruslt> exactly that one!!!
[12:08:04] <walruslt> http://kenneth.kufluk.com/google/js-mindmap/
[12:08:09] <walruslt> hehehehe
[12:08:10] <walruslt> :P
[12:08:14] <walruslt> cheers!
[12:08:19] <randomguy2> happy friday
[12:08:24] <walruslt> yay!
[12:08:25] <walruslt> :)
[12:09:28] <walruslt> beer fo you!
[12:14:31] <Es0teric> has anyone here been able to mute a youtube video ?
[12:16:14] <arc_> o_O
[12:16:21] <arc_> i guess you must mean with jquery
[12:16:29] <walruslt> ranomguy2: maybe, maybe, maybe
[12:16:35] <walruslt> randomguy2: maybe, maybe, maybe
[12:16:46] <walruslt> you know something something more new?
[12:16:46] <randomguy2> mmm?
[12:17:03] <randomguy2> oh i just found that on the googs.
[12:17:05] <walruslt> last uptdate for js-mindmap was 4 years ago
[12:17:17] <walruslt> what query on goog you use?
[12:17:36] <walruslt> to find it
[12:18:28] <randomguy2> something like mind-map, javascript or mind-map html5.  something like that.  already closed the tab
[12:18:40] <walruslt> ok
[12:18:42] <walruslt> cheers
[12:19:22] <randomguy2> the actual post that led me to it was a stack overflow question about it
[12:21:29] <walruslt> i see ok
[12:50:21] <user_juan> Hi.  I need a script to count time passing by based on a particular start time. Basically multiple records pulled from a db and each field has it's own start time.  Anything available?
[13:01:48] <Fogest> user_juan, it needs to actually just say how much time is between that database time and the current time, or does it need to start adding to that time from what the database value was at?
[13:02:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds you need moment.js
[13:03:00] <robertmaxrees> *sounds like
[13:05:53] <jeffmjack> does anyone know what you call the thing/behavior that happens in google maps on a phone when you look up a business? The map is still the main thing going on, but there is a div at the bottom of the phone stating the business name etc, which, if you swipe it up, pulls up a modal-ish window that gives more detail about the biz. Swiping down sets it back down
[13:05:53] <jeffmjack> to the minimal-looking div
[13:05:59] <ilhami>  anyone who has every integrated their application with LinkedIn? :P
[13:14:28] <user_juan> Fogest, It needs to say how much time is between the database time and current time.  So, its counting seconds, minutes, hours, days (if it's up on the screen that long).
[13:14:58] <Fogest> user_juan, it sounds like you may want to use moment.js like robertmaxrees suggested :)
[13:15:23] <user_juan> ahh, I didn't see that.  glasses misplaced ;)
[13:15:41] <user_juan> but thank you both
[13:15:57] <Fogest> user_juan, not a problem :). Hopefully that makes it nice and painless to get what you need done :)
[13:24:19] <Synthead> is there a name for the kind of serialization that happens when jQuery's $.ajax converts data in GET requests to a URI?  As an example, {foo: [5, 6]} turns into ?foo[]=5&foo[]=6
[13:26:44] <robertmaxrees> not that i'm aware of.
[13:26:51] <robertmaxrees> just that it encodes it as a URL.
[13:27:22] <gambl0re> is a class and a constructor the same thing? also a method is basically a function that is part of an object?
[13:27:33] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:27:46] <robertmaxrees> constructors are how javascript creates "new" objects.
[13:28:29] <robertmaxrees> classes are a "template" of sorts.
[13:28:39] <gambl0re> like a constructor..
[13:28:52] <robertmaxrees> sort of, expect javascript doesn't use classical inheritance.
[13:29:17] <robertmaxrees> javascript doesn't have classes, but people try to pretend like it does.
[13:29:39] <gambl0re> so it's a constructor not a class?
[13:30:15] <robertmaxrees> basically.  javascript uses prototypes, no classes.  some people like to treat constructors kind of like classes, but it's not really the same thing.
[13:31:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:32:12] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep bouncing between channels?
[13:32:19] <gambl0re> so the consturctor is the class?
[13:32:44] <robertmaxrees> i'll let them handle it from here :)
[13:33:25] <gambl0re> yea sorry...just trying to get help.
[13:33:28] <gambl0re> thanks
[14:23:23] <cardguy1000> I have a listview and for only one of the list items I'd like it to contain a collapsible list view.  I can't seem to get this to work properly, there is a margin all around Item 2.  I'm using jquery mobile version 1.4.5 with jquery 2.1.4.  Any ideas?  http://pastebin.com/ECQiJpAX
[14:25:16] <robertmaxrees> cardguy1000  of the list items I'd like it to contain a collapsible list view.  I can't seem to get this to work properly, there is a marg
[14:25:17] <robertmaxrees> woops
[14:25:21] <robertmaxrees> meant http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xa18nrtf/
[14:26:43] <cardguy1000> robertmaxrees, See how there is a margin all around item 2?  I'm trying to get ride of that so that it looks just like another item in the list
[14:26:52] <robertmaxrees> the use CSS>
[14:26:55] <robertmaxrees> *then
[14:28:35] <cardguy1000> It seemed like it was a markup problem that I didn't want to hack with a css fix.
[14:28:55] <robertmaxrees> not a hack with css.
[14:29:08] <robertmaxrees> you want to change the way it looks - that's what CSS is for :)
[14:34:05] <cardguy1000> This may be a ridiciulously simple question, but how do you add jquery mobile to jsfiddle.  Do you use an external resource or is it built in somewhere?
[14:34:12] <robertmaxrees> see the upper left?
[14:34:48] <cardguy1000> Under Frameworks & Extensions on the left I see Jquery in the dropdown
[14:34:51] <cardguy1000> but no mobile
[14:35:06] <robertmaxrees> select "jquery 2.1.0"
[14:35:17] <cardguy1000> Ah
[14:35:18] <cardguy1000> thanks
[14:36:14] <cardguy1000> See in 1.4.0 they did it all in just markup: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/listview-collapsible-item-flat/#Regularlistview
[14:36:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:36:59] <cardguy1000> Well the listview they didn't need to apply any CSS to add a collapsible listview inside a listview
[14:37:09] <robertmaxrees> that's because it was a default probably.
[14:38:21] <robertmaxrees> actually - there are css changes.
[14:38:53] <cardguy1000> Ohhhh right you are sir
[14:39:02] <cardguy1000> I didn't see that collapsed panel
[15:09:52] <pauled> Hi, how can I apply the same background color for each same content in a list? http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/sme2adk2/
[15:10:53] <pauled> the problematic is I don't know in advance the name of each element
[15:11:06] <pauled> can be random
[15:12:11] <Siphion> mh...
[15:12:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:12:46] <robertmaxrees> you want each LI to have the same background color?
[15:13:24] <pauled> I want each foo have the same but not same as bar
[15:14:03] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:14:06] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any "foo" in there.
[15:15:16] <pauled> foo can me any li that contain a unique <a>
[15:16:06] <robertmaxrees> so you want each li with Vincent-VVP do have the same color?
[15:16:13] <pauled> yes
[15:16:16] <robertmaxrees> and each li with ferrari9182 to have another.
[15:16:18] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[15:16:22] <pauled> yeah
[15:16:25] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[15:16:51] <pauled> you mean .each()?
[15:17:04] <robertmaxrees> i mean why do you want to do this?
[15:17:10] <pauled> wanted to start with that
[15:17:14] <pauled> ah
[15:17:32] <pauled> to discern conversation
[15:17:38] <pauled> like in hexchat
[15:18:09] <robertmaxrees> there are a few different ways to do this.  they're all going to be uglky.
[15:18:27] <pauled> the less ugly :)
[15:18:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah that doesn't really exist.
[15:20:31] <robertmaxrees> honestly, I'd map out a new array of all the usernames, then forEach() through those and go from there.
[15:22:28] <Siphion> yeah robertmaxrees
[15:23:14] <Siphion> or an each that check a dictionary
[15:23:27] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't .each() in this case personally.
[15:23:36] <Siphion> why not?
[15:23:49] <robertmaxrees> where would you use it?
[15:24:28] <Siphion> http://fiddle.jshell.net/Siphion/sme2adk2/2/ robertmaxrees something like this?
[15:24:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah i wouldn't .each() in that case.
[15:24:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd forEach() through the array and find the relevant element.
[15:27:29] <robertmaxrees> honestly though 6 one way 1/2 dozen the other.
[15:27:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm obsessed with .map() and arrays and stuff lately.
[15:27:55] <Siphion> yeah me too :)
[15:28:12] <Siphion> but in this case i would prefer doing in one trip
[15:28:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah i can see that.
[15:30:53] <pauled> Thanks guys
[15:30:56] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[15:31:01] <robertmaxrees> fp 4 lyfe
[15:31:35] <Siphion> high programming bro
[15:31:59] <Siphion> high *order* programming bro xD
[15:32:39] <pauled> realy smart code, I see you associated each name with a color
[15:33:54] <pauled> I mean you translated each name to code color
[15:34:03] <robertmaxrees> you see why they did that, yeah?
[15:34:12] <pauled> nope
[15:34:16] <pauled> why?
[15:34:23] <robertmaxrees> de-duped list of names.
[15:37:22] <pauled> hard to me to understand how
[15:37:34] <robertmaxrees> it's using an object.
[15:37:46] <robertmaxrees> property names in objecxts need to be unique.
[15:38:28] <robertmaxrees> that's what the colorContents[keyContent] === undefined check is for.
[15:40:24] <pauled> undefined mean $(e).text() is empty?
[15:40:34] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:40:50] <robertmaxrees> means  colorContents[$(e).text()] === undefined
[15:40:55] <robertmaxrees> as in it hasn't been pushed in yet.
[15:41:07] <pauled> ah right
[15:41:16] <pauled> I got it this part
[15:44:13] <pauled> How a user have always the same color?
[15:44:27] <Siphion> weeeeel
[15:44:41] <pauled> I mean if I reload the page, the color change
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> $(e).css('background-color', colorContents[keyContent]);
[15:44:52] <Siphion> you could try to generate the color using the name
[15:44:56] <pauled> I want it keep the same color
[15:45:53] <robertmaxrees> not easy.
[15:45:56] <robertmaxrees> without localstorage.
[15:46:34] <pauled> maybe hashing the name? or length ?
[15:46:43] <robertmaxrees> that's one way to do it.
[15:47:37] <Siphion> if there's not a problem that different users connected will see different colors, the right solution is the one proposed by robertmaxrees: storing in the browser
[15:47:56] <Siphion> using local storage or cookies
[15:47:57] <robertmaxrees> he's making a userscript for himself basically.
[15:48:58] <Siphion> there's a jquery plugin which do a great work to store in the browser: jquery.cookie
[15:49:06] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use that in this case.
[15:49:12] <robertmaxrees> cookies have limitations.
[15:49:13] <pauled> an entry in localstorage for each name? it will be a lot, there is many users connected
[15:49:21] <robertmaxrees> one.
[15:49:24] <robertmaxrees> with all names.
[15:49:32] <Siphion> sorry: jquery cookie + https://github.com/julien-maurel/jQuery-Storage-API
[15:50:01] <Siphion> 4k cookies right?
[15:50:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd use localstorage here tbh.
[15:50:23] <Siphion> so... there's a lot to store key values...
[15:50:43] <robertmaxrees> the potential amount of data he'll have makes cookies not work long-term
[15:51:04] <Siphion> yeah, i would prefer too.. but i'm the one who have to support IE8.. :'(
[15:51:11] <robertmaxrees> i do, too.
[15:51:12] <robertmaxrees> he doesn't.
[15:51:16] <robertmaxrees> userscript for chrome :)
[15:51:53] <pauled> it's 3000 users average connected per time with in/out
[15:51:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:52:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd just generate on the fly imo.
[15:53:15] <pauled> but I can keep the first way, no color keeped
[15:53:34] <pauled> it's a great feature already
[15:53:59] <Siphion> :) but i would remove that random color getter!
[15:55:16] <pauled> I replace getRandomColor(); with something like var colors = ["f00", "0f0", "00f", "ff0", "0ff", "f0f"]; ?
[15:57:30] <Siphion> just a function that does not return wrongs colors like black or dark blue
[15:58:00] <Siphion> or you could not see the content
[15:58:30] <Siphion> i'm not telling you to use, but check this: https://github.com/Fooidge/PleaseJS http://www.checkman.io/please/
[16:06:03] <pauled> thanks, in one chat session there is not much users
[16:06:17] <pauled> I can keep a list of colors
[16:07:37] <pauled> like this; http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/sme2adk2/3/
[16:10:09] <pauled> but that one http://www.checkman.io/please/ is nice :) I will try to use it
[16:37:39] <gsds> hello?
[16:39:01] <gsds> what is it with people not answering a simply question like "hello?"?
[17:03:45] <pauled> hmm
[17:03:58] <pauled> hello, you happy?
[17:04:06] <robertmaxrees> they left a while ago.
[17:04:41] <pauled> I just saw his agressive message,
[17:04:48] <robertmaxrees> it's okay.
[17:04:51] <robertmaxrees> not a big deal :)
[17:05:18] <pauled> I removed the option that show in/out users
[17:06:35] <robertmaxrees> i figured.
[17:15:59] <pauled> the chat now it look nice :) http://i.imgur.com/BXfhTSu.png http://i.imgur.com/swTTkni.png
[17:16:30] <pauled> I added 2 icons button, one to clear the chat and the second to fullscreen
[17:17:08] <acidjazz> pauled: cool site
[17:17:16] <acidjazz> pauled: whats the back end?
[17:17:20] <robertmaxrees> pauled those are the userscripts for it, right?
[17:17:30] <pauled> yeah very nice chess site, open source also
[17:17:42] <pauled> robertmaxrees: yes
[17:17:57] <arc_> what do the userscripts do
[17:18:02] <acidjazz> pauled: who did that menu hamburger at the top right?
[17:18:08] <pauled> acidjazz: seems it's wrttend in scala
[17:18:12] <robertmaxrees> it's js that he's running from his browser.
[17:18:16] <robertmaxrees> like, for himseflf.
[17:18:19] <robertmaxrees> *himself
[17:18:38] <arc_> i know what a userscript is, i'm asking what functionality he added to the site :p
[17:19:20] <pauled> acidjazz: I don't know, you could ask in #lichess, #lichess-dev or look into github/ornicar
[17:20:10] <pauled> link of source is in hamburger menu
[17:20:29] <Siphion> lot of tabs D:
[17:20:37] <robertmaxrees> i was JUSt about to say that hahahaha
[17:21:03] <acidjazz> https://github.com/ornicar/lila
[17:21:27] <robertmaxrees> ooh.
[17:21:29] <robertmaxrees> play framework.
[17:25:15] <pauled> it's the hamburger menu that brought me here to make a topmenu userscript when they replaced the topbar with the hamburger menu. But since one week they have backtracked and back the topbar menu.
[17:26:51] <pauled> they are shuffling with features
[17:27:05] <robertmaxrees> good :0
[17:27:29] <pauled> some time it add something usefull, sometime it remove it or move in another place
[17:41:44] <Poppabear> quick noob question, how do i post the addition "params" with this http://pastebin.com/XJdmb5yB
[17:42:08] <robertmaxrees> two ways.
[17:42:28] <robertmaxrees> 1 - add it to the form in hidden inputs and let the serialize handle it instead.
[17:42:48] <robertmaxrees> 2 - manually append it in the correct format to the serialized URL.
[17:42:55] <robertmaxrees> do the first one.
[17:43:48] <Poppabear> well those params values are generated via jquery response from an api, so i will not be able to use option 1
[17:44:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:45:03] <Poppabear> sec i will post the whole thing here
[17:46:57] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: maybe this will clear it up http://pastebin.com/DW7XCdhh
[17:47:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah that doesn't change my point.
[17:48:20] <Poppabear> how would i use the hidden input with values from the jquery ?
[17:48:23] <robertmaxrees> in the success callback, add those as inputs.
[17:48:32] <Poppabear> maybe that should have been the question :P
[17:48:35] <robertmaxrees> where's the form?
[17:49:28] <Poppabear> local to the jquery
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> 'cause it'd basically be $('form').append('<input type="hidden" value=' + userid + '</input>');
[17:49:50] <Poppabear> ahhh .. duh
[17:50:00] <Poppabear> that makes sense .. thanks
[17:51:11] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i disappear into the night!
[17:51:13] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[19:23:37] <DietDrK> My JQuery mobile form closes on every letter input into a form. What should I be looking at?
[19:25:33] <DietDrK> perhaps the keyboard takes away focus or something from the popup?
[19:37:39] <DietDrK> figured it out. predictive text on my android takes up more screen space, so popup has to resize/reposition, then it closes my keyboard in doing so, resizing again.
[20:02:17] <DietDrK1> I figured out all I have to do is find a way to stop repositioning
[20:16:13] <ChrisBinge> has anyone ever done any work getting font size to take the most of a containers size?
[22:14:56] <ramsub07> hello guys
