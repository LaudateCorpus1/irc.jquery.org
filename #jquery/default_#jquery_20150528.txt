[00:00:02] <E1> i just create live chat, and now it's working with any browsers,,but it didn't work for android phone and blackberry
[00:00:06] <Cork> *end even went*
[00:00:17] <Cork> why do my fingers keep typing even/event in reverse >_<
[00:00:21] <Uhkis> Cork: well cut/copy ain't that bad
[00:00:30] <E1> when user click to input name, no pop up keyboard for android
[00:00:39] <Cork> Uhkis: the onpaste event already exist
[00:00:55] <Cork> ?mdn onpaste
[00:00:56] <b-ot> Cork: HTMLElement.onpaste - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/onpaste
[00:01:57] <Cork> (also all browsers support it as far as i know
[00:02:06] <Cork> i think mozilla was the last one to implement it
[00:02:17] <Cork> E1: not sure what the question is
[00:02:46] <Uhkis> wow
[00:03:04] <Cork> Uhkis: but the onpaste event is quite sane actually
[00:03:16] <Cork> you can only grab the content when a paste is made in the page
[00:03:19] <Uhkis> yeah, it can be disabled :D
[00:03:25] <Cork> and you can't keep a reference to it outside the event handler
[00:03:44] <Cork> Uhkis: and it is among the first things i disable when i create a browser profile :)
[00:03:54] <Cork> Uhkis: but that is more cause of the oncopy event
[00:03:56] <E1> i dont know how to explain my problem
[00:04:08] <Cork> that many sites use to inject "ads" in the content you copy from there site
[00:04:29] <Uhkis> Cork: that's SO ANNOYING
[00:04:41] <Cork> ya, and hence why i disable it
[00:05:25] <sammych1> when you copy excerpts from iBooks, it puts all the attribution in with it
[00:05:59] <sammych1> I don't go the dodgy sites that hijack my copy text anyway. Haven't had it happen to me in recent memory
[00:06:20] <Cork> Uhkis, sammych1: http://bavotasan.com/2010/add-a-copyright-notice-to-copied-text/
[00:06:59] <Uhkis> hahaa!
[00:07:14] <Uhkis> about:config > stupid copy event!
[00:07:14] <sammych1> yeah, I figured that's what was happening
[00:07:47] <Cork> there is useful things the event can be used for too
[00:07:56] <E1> for android, when i click field to input name, the input field disappear,
[00:08:01] <Cork> but ya, today it is more used for messing with the user then anything else
[00:08:22] <Uhkis> well what isn't these days
[00:08:54] <Cork> ya, if it can be abused; it will
[00:09:09] <Cork> heck even scroll position, or page content height got abused >_<
[00:09:10] <Uhkis> especially for "marketing"
[00:09:20] <Cork> or onbeforeunload
[00:09:41] <E1> hmmm
[00:09:55] <Cork> E1: that is very little info to go on
[00:10:07] <Cork> is this specific to when you load jquery or what?
[00:10:08] <Uhkis> Cork: "please don't go away" confirm dialogs?
[00:10:44] <Cork> Uhkis: more like "please send $x to this bitcoin address to unlock closing this tab"
[00:11:11] <Uhkis> hahaha, haven't seen that kind of browser kidnapping
[00:11:31] <E1> i load jquery function when element was clicked, and field the box, when field the box was touch, field box was disappear,,this is happening with android only
[00:11:47] <sammych1> nah, the best one is the opening an app store link on page load
[00:12:17] <Uhkis> doesn't matter
[00:12:41] <Woet> hi Uhkis
[00:13:19] <Cork> Uhkis: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=908289

[01:42:13] <DRSK> Hello, quick question. LazyLoadXT offers events for binding, but I'm not sure how to use them. Anyone able to give a hint? https://github.com/ressio/lazy-load-xt/blob/master/README.md#events Simply console.log on lazyinit will do, I just don't get the pattern.
[01:47:25] <Uhkis> $(element).on('lazyinit', function() { console.log('init'); });
[01:51:54] <DRSK> Uhkis » yeah I've tried :p

[03:10:32] <qua> hi guys! I have got some problems of comprehension :( someone there?
[03:11:13] <lee__> hi
[03:11:59] <lee__> is there any way to trigger an event when data gets loaded into a div which is happening from devexpress control
[03:13:05] <lee__> can we register any event on any element for a data load?
[03:15:19] <qua> Hey, I want to make a post-request on a sub-page from a super-page. Via javascript / jquery. I have no idea what i need - my guess ist jquery.pos() / jquery.ajax() - but everytime I send the request everything I get is the source-code of the sub-page
[03:16:18] <lee__> jquery.ajax should work
[03:16:47] <lee__> <qua> what is that you want to get/post?
[03:18:22] <qua> lee__: I am not sure how to answer it - there is a <form> with an action I want to change a value inside the form ans submit
[03:20:40] <lee__> <Qua> i dont understand
[03:22:20] <qua> <form methode="POST" [....] action="issue5"> And <input type="text" name="sequenze">    This is on the subpage. but on the other webpage I need to create an function that will make the POST request
[03:22:39] <qua> "on" the subpage.
[03:31:03] <lee__> <qua> is it like you want to trigger the submit of subform from another form
[03:31:06] <lee__> then $('form#myForm').submit();
[03:31:36] <qua> lee__: I am nur sure about that
[03:32:33] <ddio> I have an form <form method="post" accept-charset="utf-8" id="PasswordEditForm" role="form" action="/PasswordLists/edit/67"> and want to preventDefault with $('body #PasswordListEditForm').on('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault() }), but it doesn't work... can anyone help?
[03:33:10] <ddio> I guess my selector isn't firing but I have another form similiar and there this selector works
[03:33:32] <benjaminschoch> maybe try an additional return false within the callback function?
[03:33:52] <qua> to be concret: I am on the webpage: http://localhost:8917/demo/ And on the webage: "http://localhost:8917/demo/issue5" there is a form. This form is submitted by a "POST". I want to trigger exactly this request on the webpage "http://localhost:8917/demo/issue5" from the other webpage "http://localhost:8917/demo/".
[03:34:22] <lee__> put $(' #PasswordListEditForm').on() and see
[03:35:49] <benjaminschoch> i got a question regarding selector extension in jquery. i know about jQuery.extend(jQuery.expr[':']..., but I want to generally "prepare" the given selector before it is passed the jquery. is there a method for that?
[03:36:22] <ddio> lee__: no the form still gets executed
[03:37:12] <lee__> <ddio> troubleshoot by putting debugger; and see whether the selector is firing or not
[03:37:26] <ddio> benjaminschoch: you mean $('body #PasswordListEditForm').on('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault() }, false)  ??
[03:38:05] <ddio> lee__: when I do $('body #PasswordListEditForm').on('submit', function(event) { console.log("test"); event.preventDefault() }), it doesn't get logged
[03:38:13] <benjaminschoch> ddio: $('body #PasswordListEditForm').on('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); /* whatever */ return false; })
[03:38:49] <benjaminschoch> ddio: ok so the suggested solution doesnt work neither if the selector is not matched
[03:39:40] <ddio> benjaminschoch:yes, with return false the form is still executed
[03:39:57] <qua> lee__:  to be concret: I am on the webpage: http://localhost:8917/demo/ And on the webage: "http://localhost:8917/demo/issue5" there is a form. This form is submitted by a "POST". I want to trigger exactly this request on the webpage "http://localhost:8917/demo/issue5" from the other webpage "http://localhost:8917/demo/".
[03:40:05] <Uhkis> ddio: your selector is wrong..
[03:40:28] <ddio> Uhkis:could you be a bit more precise?:)
[03:40:29] <benjaminschoch> ddio: id="PasswordEditForm"
[03:40:30] <Uhkis> ddio: $('body #PasswordEditForm')
[03:40:43] <benjaminschoch> :)
[03:41:14] <aep> anyone knows a plugin for laying out game cards in a stack?
[03:42:31] <ddio> Uhkis: benjaminschoch: omg fml thx
[03:43:29] <lee__> <qua> $('input#submitButton').click( function() {     $.post( 'some-url', $('form#myForm').serialize(), function(data) {          ... do something with response from server        },        'json' // I expect a JSON response     ); });
[03:45:27] <lee__> <Uhkis> is there any way to trigger an event when data gets loaded into a div which is happening from devexpress control
[03:46:21] <Uhkis> lee__: those <> aren't a part of nick
[03:46:28] <Uhkis> lee__: what's devexpress control?
[03:47:02] <benjaminschoch> another try: someone has experience with selector extending / rewriting before triggering the actual jquery selector call?
[03:47:54] <lee__> <uhkis>  In dev express control the datasources are defined while designing the dashboard.
[03:48:00] <qua> lee__: Thanks - i will try this - what can I co with "data"
[03:49:36] <lee__> <uhkis> the generated xml is renedered in the devexpress viewer
[03:49:37] <Uhkis> lee__: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/ maybe?
[03:50:41] <lee__> <uhkis> but i have got a clientside event where i can register an event for a td where the data will be loaded
[03:54:19] <qua> lee__: when I add 'json', the function cannot be called. When I make this function without 'json'. "data" contains the source-code of the target page. I am not sure what to do with this "data".
[03:56:26] <lee__> <quo> but is the subform is getting submitted?
[03:58:49] <qua> lee__: I can not really tell. I am not even allowed to give the form a proper "id". I have to use the name wich is "itemSynopsis". I hope jquery can get along with that : "  $('form[name="itemSynopsis"]').serialize(),  "
[03:59:06] <Jattenalle> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU
[04:01:33] <qua> lee__: according to my debugger, there is a post request. returned "200"
[04:05:18] <lee__> <qa> 200 is good right?
[04:05:45] <qua> lee__: dunno. I expeted 302. but well - I have no idea
[04:06:02] <Uhkis> lee__: so you're looking for trigger('event') instead?
[04:06:27] <lee__> <uhkis> i tried ajaxcomplete but no luck
[04:06:57] <Eagle__> hi :) I'd like to reset  sessionStorage after refresh  (f5) how can i do this? thx
[04:07:14] <lee__> <uhkis? how can i reister an event on td for a data load?
[04:08:21] <lee__> <uhkis> did you mean td.trigger('load',function(){});
[04:09:19] <qua> lee__: I made the post: $.post( 'issue5', $('form[name="itemSynopsis"]').serialize(), function(data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {console.log("data: " + data);} );   -   and data contained the whole source-code of the web-page. I still want to modify the data inside the <form> on the subpage automaticly.
[04:09:34] <qua> (and submit / post - whatever)
[04:09:49] <Uhkis> lee__: if ajaxComplete isn't doing it for you, no clue
[04:09:49] <delboy1978uk> how do i select a before element to change its content? span.expand-indicator:before
[04:16:29] <benjaminschoch> delboy1978uk: it's not that easy, as pseudo elements are not part of the DOM. you can go with a hack solution by modifying the parent containers class and defining different contents in the CSS content property.
[04:17:12] <delboy1978uk> yes i’m noticing its all fun and games lol
[05:06:38] <rindolf> Hi all.
[05:11:11] <CaptObvious_> When doing $("myForm").submit(); from an HTTPS page it's trying to submit to http://.... - I can't find in the docs how to fix this
[05:11:17] <CaptObvious_> Any ideas?
[05:11:51] <benjaminschoch> CaptObvious_: what is the target of the form element?
[05:12:04] <CaptObvious_> there isn't one
[05:12:10] <CaptObvious_> it's supposed to submit to the current page
[05:12:12] <Cork> you sure?
[05:12:25] <Cork> cause it should inherit the protocol in that case
[05:12:30] <CaptObvious_> <form id="addPsForm" autocomplete="off" method="POST">
[05:12:53] <Cork> that should be https if the page is
[05:12:57] <CaptObvious_> it's not
[05:13:15] <CaptObvious_> the site is only served over HTTPS, it doesn't respond to HTTP
[05:13:20] <CaptObvious_> submit the form, nothing
[05:13:39] <CaptObvious_> looked at it with chrome dev tools and it's trying to POST to http://....
[05:13:42] <Cork> CaptObvious_: have you checked in the browser networks tab so it actually is using http?
[05:13:44] <Cork> ah
[05:13:47] <pauled> Hi, is that it's correct to write a varlable like this? if ($('body').hasClass('dark')) { var color = "white"; } else { color = "black";}
[05:13:52] <skullcrasher> how can I check with a delegate click handler, if anything inside an element is clicked?
[05:13:53] <skullcrasher> http://pastebin.com/wPsgnWrG
[05:14:25] <benjaminschoch> CaptObvious_: did you try to add the target url including https:// into the form tag
[05:14:31] <pauled> ah nevermind, I must put var before
[05:14:34] <xelim> CaptObvious_: do you have any redirects in you .htaccess file ?
[05:14:49] <Cork> benjaminschoch: that isn't needed
[05:14:59] <CaptObvious_> benjaminschoch: I'd rather not specify the full URL, as the site is accessed over various hostnames (alpha, beta, prod)
[05:15:05] <benjaminschoch> CaptObvious_: yes, just wanted to make sure that that works
[05:15:28] <CaptObvious_> xelim: I don't use apache, it's uwsgi with Flask/Python
[05:15:29] <benjaminschoch> to find out if it is a server or code issue
[05:15:53] <obert> flask!
[05:15:56] <CaptObvious_> oh.  I think I know what it is.
[05:16:08] <CaptObvious_> It's behind a load balancer which does SSL termination
[05:16:17] <CaptObvious_> the web server speaks to the load balancer over plain HTTP
[05:16:39] <ramsub07> hello guys, I'm new to JQuery, can someone please explain me what .find() does ?
[05:16:47] <Cork> CaptObvious_: https://jsfiddle.net/kL9ute0y/
[05:16:51] <obert> I got a project with flask :P
[05:16:53] <Cork> can't reproduce
[05:16:54] <CaptObvious_> ramsub07: https://api.jquery.com/find/
[05:17:17] <CaptObvious_> Cork: yeah, I think jQuery thinks it's HTTP as it's behind a load balancer
[05:17:21] <Cork> no
[05:17:30] <Cork> CaptObvious_: jquery doesn't run behind the load balancer
[05:17:30] <CaptObvious_> wait, no, that makes no sense
[05:17:32] <CaptObvious_> yeah
[05:17:54] <Cork> CaptObvious_: the only reason it could have that effect is if you have something server side that adds the url to the form dynamically
[05:18:20] <Cork> but then yes that could cause the server to see the url behind the loadbalancer, and those are normally http
[05:18:45] <CaptObvious_> view source -> <form id="addPsForm" autocomplete="off" method="POST">
[05:18:58] <Cork> CaptObvious_: you have a base in the header?
[05:18:59] <xelim> well you have a loadbalancer service that the user connects to via ssl and the load balancer communicates to the server via plain http
[05:19:14] <Cork> xelim: exactly, but that only affect server side
[05:19:15] <xelim> ohh never mind
[05:19:39] <CaptObvious_> one sec, I'll grab headers
[05:19:42] <xelim> yes ... the browser should just use the client's protocol
[05:20:05] <Cork> not shouldn't, it doesn't know anything else
[05:20:20] <CaptObvious_> request URL in the headers is https://
[05:20:36] <Cork> CaptObvious_: you could just check the pages url
[05:20:41] <Cork> the header doesn't really matter here
[05:20:50] <CaptObvious_> Cork: what do you mean?
[05:20:51] <Cork> what i asked for is in the <head>
[05:20:53] <CaptObvious_> Oh
[05:21:01] <CaptObvious_> you said "in the header"
[05:21:15] <Cork> <base href="">
[05:21:19] <CaptObvious_> nope
[05:21:29] <Cork> doesn't make any sense then...
[05:21:38] <Cork> and you're not loading the form through ajax?
[05:22:38] <ramsub07> CaptObvious_:  so what does .find(' input, select');  do ?
[05:23:24] <Cork> ramsub07: it will search for children of the element it is ran on that match those selectors
[05:23:40] <CaptObvious_> Cork: nope, standard form
[05:23:42] <Cork> to expand a bit $('selector') === $(document).find('selector')
[05:23:58] <ramsub07> Cork: you mean the select inside input will be searched ?
[05:23:58] <Cork> CaptObvious_: then the problem makes no sense
[05:24:03] <Cork> no
[05:24:07] <CaptObvious_> I agree, which is why I'm here :)
[05:24:36] <Cork> ramsub07: sounds like you need to read up on selectors
[05:24:39] <Cork> ramsub07: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors
[05:25:03] <Cork> ah, they don't talk about it >_<
[05:25:41] <Cork> ah, stupid documentations...
[05:25:50] <Cork> ramsub07: comma has the meaning or "or" in css
[05:26:02] <ramsub07> oh
[05:27:07] <Cork> there we go
[05:27:08] <CaptObvious_> Cork: I don't understand why this isn't working :(
[05:27:16] <Cork> ramsub07: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#grouping
[05:27:32] <Cork> CaptObvious_: ya, and i can't help without seeing it
[05:28:00] <CaptObvious_> it's an internal system unfortunately :(
[05:28:26] <Cork> ya, all i can say is; 1. shouldn't happen so look broader, 2. can't reproduce
[05:28:34] <Cork> and 2 is not helpful at all :/
[05:28:55] <Cork> hmm
[05:28:56] <Cork> actually
[05:28:59] <CaptObvious_> gonna try a different browser, maybe it's chrome weirdness
[05:29:18] <Cork> heh CaptObvious_ have you checked so you don't have a on('submit', func) or submit(func) handler=
[05:29:19] <Cork> *?
[05:29:26] <Cork> it might be messing with it
[05:29:38] <Cork> CaptObvious_: no the test case i made was tested on both firefox and chrome
[05:30:34] <CaptObvious_> yeah, it failed in firefox too
[05:31:14] <Cork> would be very surprised if it didn't
[05:31:38] <CaptObvious_> Cork: I have a validation function that runs like this: $(document).on("click", "input[type='submit']"
[05:31:48] <Cork> ouch
[05:31:58] <Cork> that should be on submit not click (of the form)
[05:32:00] <CaptObvious_> not my code :P
[05:32:03] <Cork> but ya, prob doesn't matter
[05:32:15] <Cork> still badly written >_>
[05:32:20] <CaptObvious_> hmm
[05:32:21] <CaptObvious_> $(document).on("click", "input[type='submit']", function(e) {
[05:32:29] <Cork> O_o'
[05:32:32] <CaptObvious_> does it matter that there's no close parenthesis?  :P
[05:32:54] <Cork> you don't have }); ?
[05:33:10] <CaptObvious_> at the end of the function yeah
[05:33:19] <Cork> then it is as it should
[05:33:26] <Fogest> I want to when I hit edit on an element, have it not include the extra stuff in the brackets, only the mac address. Here is a sample of the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/vuc586Ln/
[05:33:28] <CaptObvious_> okay, that's weird syntax
[05:33:39] <CaptObvious_> <- python guy
[05:33:43] <Cork> CaptObvious_: not really, its an inline function
[05:34:14] <Cork> its the same as var tmp = function() {}; $(document).on('click', 'input[type="submit"]', tmp)
[05:34:37] <CaptObvious_> that's a lot of punctuation.
[05:34:48] <CaptObvious_> <Cork> heh CaptObvious_ have you checked so you don't have a on('submit', func) or submit(func) handler=
[05:34:51] <Cork> uh, its exactly one
[05:34:52] <CaptObvious_> it doesn't appear so
[05:35:18] <Cork> CaptObvious_: desperation, try disabling javascript and see if it still sends it to http
[05:37:04] <CaptObvious_> submits to https:// without JS
[05:37:15] <CaptObvious_> I've done a search of all of our js for "http" and there is none
[05:38:10] <Cork> CaptObvious_: ok, so you have some event handler somewhere messing with you
[05:39:36] <CaptObvious_> it seems so, but I don't see how if "http" isn't in the code at all
[05:40:15] <Cork> could be a replace(/s/, '') or replace(/s:/, ':')
[05:40:42] <Cork> CaptObvious_: best might be to put a breakpoint at .submit() and start stepping through it
[05:41:09] <Cork> it will be stepping hell, and jquery loves to recurse
[05:41:15] <Cork> but... i don't see what else you could do
[05:42:35] <ramsub07> Cork: it selects all the selectors named "input" ?
[05:42:55] <Cork> ramsub07: it selects all elements matching "input" or "select"
[05:43:17] <Cork> that is a child of the element your running it on (not just one level deep)
[05:50:30] <vivekananda> hi everyone. I still trying to figure out. I want to do an ajax "PoST" to self and then refresh so that the page has the posted info. Is there a good way to do this. I tried two ways. 1. redirect in the .success(){} of ajax and nothing happens  2. do a location.href = "self.php" but I know this is silly as ajax is asyncrhonous so this wont be reliable
[05:51:38] <vivekananda> I was discussing this yesterday and did get some good alternative solutions but still unsure of what to use
[05:52:09] <Uhkis> posting ajax and refreshing the page makes no sense
[05:53:16] <Uhkis> what you're describing is the normal way to submit a form
[05:56:20] <lucastockmann1> Hello everybody. I got a problem. I try to access an instance of a plugin (slick.js). After initalizing I use the same selector and context in another js file. But I'm not able to call methods on the instance. Is this by design or is it me doing something wrong?
[05:57:38] <vivekananda> Uhkis, yeah it doesn't . The problem is . well nevermind. I guess I have to do it completely either via js or via a proper form submit.
[06:06:14] <lucastockmann> Hello everybody. I got a problem. I try to access an instance of a plugin (slick.js). After initalizing I use the same selector and context in another js file. But I'm not able to call methods on the instance. Is this by design or is it me doing something wrong?
[06:09:12] <lucastockmann> http://pastebin.com/sqs4muxR additional to the text i wrote. ^^
[06:09:37] <Fogest> vivekananda, well if you want to submit it via ajax and then refresh you can do that with js/jquery, but I don't see a reason to do it that way.
[06:10:53] <Fogest> vivekananda, like you can just use location.refresh() (http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_loc_reload.asp) to refresh it after the ajax but seems odd. Would make more sense to do a submit. With ajax the query could fail and you would need proper checking to verify it worked before refreshing.
[06:11:54] <Fogest> lucastockmann, make sure file 2 is being loaded on the page AFTER file 1.
[06:12:59] <ismithers> I have a link to a YouTube video, how can I show this video in a jqueryui dialog?
[06:13:31] <Fogest> ismithers, try this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4532210/jquery-ui-popup-a-youtube-video-modally
[06:14:23] <vivekananda> Fogest, it is just that I am stuck. HOw you ask ? . Well the index.php I have has sections ( big chunks of html) which enable/disable based on php variables. I was happy doing php prg(post request get paradigm)  and stuff. Along comes google login. It only works via a callback ( in my limited knoweledge ). now I have a callback which is receiving -- 'okay , user logged in.Now change index.php to reflect this with the
[06:14:24] <vivekananda> changed values'. Now I am stuck . I cannot manipulate php variables from callback ( is js/jquery) :(. I will have to just delete huge node chunks and attach new ones. The last option is to post on the page and then refresh!
[06:15:54] <Fogest> vivekananda, well if you look at how other places do it I guess that may be the way some of them do it. You hit login via Google, you get a little loading icon, and then the page refreshes.
[06:22:28] <vivekananda> Fogest, so my last method ie ajax via jquery and then refresh is the way to go ? Can you gimme a link to any example that uses this ? Also I have been trying to use it but I don't know how exactly to do it to make it reliable
[06:23:01] <Fogest> vivekananda, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11482296/google-plus-connect-api-using-jquery-ajax
[06:31:54] <vivekananda> Fogest, the detailed sourcce code there uses ajax and then deletes and adds nodes to html. I guess that is the best way so I will have to do that. Just that my jquery function length will go through the roof doing this !
[06:32:03] <vivekananda> https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/javascript/start/start-js
[06:33:17] <Fogest> vivekananda, that isn't much jquery :P
[06:33:53] <vivekananda> Fogest, yeah , more js but the flow is what i am talking about :)
[06:34:34] <Fogest> vivekananda, Yeah I just mean in general what is there is not that much code for doing a whole authentication with a 3rd party. Especially if you minify your js :)
[06:35:40] <vivekananda> Fogest, I didn't get that. could you rephrase
[06:36:44] <Fogest> vivekananda, Well the code on that page isn't really that big. It is a small amount of code and it accomplishes a lot. You can also use a minifying program to make your javascript be more "compressed"
[06:39:15] <xebra> hi, I'don't think I understand the difference between using clone() with withDataAndEvents = true
[06:41:48] <Fogest> xebra, if you look at one of the examples on the jquery page (https://api.jquery.com/clone/) they have $elem.clone( true). Look above that line and noticed how they have the element being set with .data()
[06:42:09] <Fogest> xebra, when you use clone() with the boolean set to true, things such as that .data() will be copied too
[06:42:22] <Fogest> As well as any events that are attached to it will also be attched to the cloned element
[06:44:00] <vivekananda> Fogest, so you mean to say I can use equivalent code for my program and then minify my js. Two problems there  1. The code you see there just changes one element or two( in step 6) . My code has to change much more .  2. I tried minifying my js already but gives me errors.  :(. but will try again. also Can I minify other js too with this 'minifying' program. you have a link to something good ?
[06:45:20] <xebra> Fogest, thanks. I'm more worried about events, actually. I cloned some form fields that have validation, I cloned them just with clone(), and the validation still works on the cloned elements. This means the events are attached, even though I cloned with withDataAndEvents = false. That's what I don't get
[06:45:45] <Fogest> vivekananda, you don't have to minify your code. I just suggested it as an option if you think it is needed. I don't have a suggestion. There are many ways people set up such things. You definitely do not want to code using minified code. Too hard to read and follow, minified code is only for serving to the user not working with.
[06:46:32] <Fogest> xebra, but what do your selectors look like for that validation? Could be that the selector is still picking up the newly cloned one.
[06:47:55] <vivekananda> Fogest, I know that ( about it being useful only during serving up). I asked coz I didn't know of a good program to do it but no worries I will look for one :)
[06:49:38] <Fogest> vivekananda, There are ways to set it up so it does it on the fly when the page is requested, some CDN's can be setup to autmatically minify. You can have build scripts that will do it, and you can do it manually using programs or even pasting it into a website. A lot of choices, I don't know which route you want.
[06:50:37] <vivekananda> Fogest, never used a CDN wonder if drupal is one or has one built in ?
[06:51:27] <xebra> Fogest, I wish I could find it, the code is pretty complex. Anyway, I guess that if I wanted to be sure that I am really cloning something (html + related javascript), I'd better use withDataAndEvents = TRUE. Right?
[06:52:15] <Fogest> vivekananda, uh a CDN is a content delivery network. It would be a 3rd party company that you pay to serve your website from multiple locations around the world. If you don't know what it is you likely don't have one. Drupal has some functions for auto minify it seems: http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/57358/how-to-minify-js-and-css-in-d7-without-using-modules
[06:53:43] <Fogest> xebra, if you wanted to make sure you have all the attached events and any .data() you have attached to them, than yes, otherwise you don't need to. The clone'd elements will still have the same id's and classes as the element it was cloned from so in most cases the jquery selectors will apply to the cloned element as well due to this.
[06:54:49] <vivekananda> Fogest, I knew a little but wasn't too sure how CDNs worked. Thanks for clarifying
[06:55:21] <Fogest> vivekananda, yeah you likely don't have one, nor do you really need one unless you are a larger site.
[06:55:34] <vivekananda> yep I guess.
[06:57:22] <vivekananda> Fogest, another question, somewhat unrelated. one of my jquery functions does a sql query on a table and gets the total count. This function delays the page loading. I was wondering if there is a way that I can do this in the background and free the page from it holding the page up. Would jquery be a good choice for persistent data or should I do something else
[06:57:24] <CSWookie> Hey, all.  I'm having problems with memory leaks in displaying a jqgrid, which eventually takes down Firefox.
[06:58:24] <Fogest> vivekananda, I am assuming that jquery is making an ajax call to a php file that then does the sql query, correct?
[06:58:52] <xebra> Fogest, hmm... but if you bind an element to a click event when the document is ready, and then you clone that element LATER ON... will the cloned element be attached to the click event? I think I'm going to try
[06:59:01] <Fogest> CSWookie, maybe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21990063/memory-leak-with-jquery-dialog-e-jqgrid
[07:00:38] <Fogest> xebra, .click() should not add to newly created elements, only to ones existing on page load. You can use the .on('click') function if you wanted it to be added to elements added after page load
[07:03:38] <xebra> Fogest, uh, I didn't know that difference between click() and on('click) ...I guess I should just use clone() with withDataAndEvents to avoid problems, so it'll clone everything. Thanks
[07:03:59] <Fogest> xebra, no problem. Good lcuk :)
[07:06:27] <vivekananda> Fogest. Currently it is just php inside the html that does it but what you suggested can be done too. Just that I want that value to be accessible to the page
[07:07:43] <mento> Hi i got a lot of status text on my website, those are enums in my DB such as "OrderConfirmed, OrderUnconfirmed, OrderCancelled, etc" i want to display them on the website in a more user friendly way such a "Order confirmed , Order unconfirmed". Whats the best way to do this with jQuery? I want to change the display of the text using jQuery
[07:07:53] <pauled> In http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/ I don't understand $( "#foo" ).toggleClass( className, addOrRemove );
[07:08:10] <Fogest> vivekananda, no it is fine leaving it the way it is. Does the PHP execute the query on page load for the first time, or is it called with jquery's ajax when page loads?
[07:08:17] <pauled> I don't see what mean AddOrRemove in http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/xx7540nw/
[07:08:36] <pauled> getting this error; Uncaught ReferenceError: className is not defined
[07:09:13] <Fogest> mento, so for all of them you want to add a space between them, or how exactly do you want to change them?
[07:09:38] <mento> not just a space, in some cases the text is different
[07:10:17] <Fogest> pauled, those need to be strings, you are not using strings. You need quotation marks.
[07:11:11] <pauled> Fogest: it's correct in that way? http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/xx7540nw/1/
[07:11:22] <NCS_One> hi
[07:12:07] <Fogest> pauled, that would work. However I don't think you are understanding the function correctly.
[07:12:26] <Fogest> The first element is the class to be toggled. So it will be removed if it exists, or added if it doesn't
[07:12:45] <Fogest> NCS_One, hi
[07:12:47] <NCS_One> how can I prevent the element "option" to be dropped into another "option" but only in the "select"? https://jsfiddle.net/ekkoyo7y/
[07:12:59] <NCS_One> hmm
[07:13:26] <pauled> yes ;( getting trouble to understand function, Wanting to change (not adding or removing) the classe on clic
[07:13:31] <NCS_One> bad English :/
[07:13:35] <Fogest> NCS_One, I am confused what you want to do :/
[07:14:10] <Fogest> pauled, so you want to change which class the element has?
[07:14:22] <NCS_One> how can I prevent the element "option" to be dropped into another "option". I only want to drop in the "select" elements? https://jsfiddle.net/ekkoyo7y/
[07:14:36] <mento> Fogest: not just a space, in some cases the status text is different
[07:14:38] <pauled> yes
[07:15:08] <pauled> maybe I have to use .is() or .hasClass()
[07:15:12] <NCS_One> Fogest: if you try the example you can drop an "option" into another "option", I wanto to prevent it
[07:15:25] <Fogest> mento, you can iterate through the elements and check if the text matches one of the texts you want to change. If it does then you can change it with .text()
[07:15:53] <mento> Fogest:  i was thinking about a switch statement, is that useful in this case?
[07:16:07] <Fogest> pauled, well those would be used to check if they have a specific class or not, not actually change it
[07:16:21] <Fogest> mento, yes that is what I would suggest using.
[07:16:50] <Fogest> NCS_One, the drag and drop is not working for me
[07:17:09] <mento> Fogest: okay thanks, than i was on the right track :) thanks for the heads up
[07:17:42] <pauled> Fogest: currently I am trying to understand $( "#foo" ).toggleClass( className, addOrRemove ); I updated http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/xx7540nw/3/
[07:17:57] <Fogest> mento, yep you are definitely on the right track. You said you are getting this data from the database though. You could have the PHP side modify stuff before sending it to the page?
[07:19:02] <NCS_One> Fogest: what browser?
[07:19:05] <pauled> what mean ( className, addOrRemove )
[07:19:08] <Fogest> NCS_One, chrome
[07:19:32] <Fogest> pauled, the addORRemove part is assentially a true or false value. But this can be determined with an expression.
[07:19:47] <Fogest> pauled, look at there example: $thisParagraph.toggleClass( "highlight", count % 3 === 0 );
[07:22:19] <NCS_One> Fogest: doesn't work in chrome :/
[07:22:20] <pauled> My goal is to append a button to toggle fullscreen
[07:22:26] <NCS_One> damn
[07:22:40] <Fogest> NCS_One, Well that mayyy be a problem you want to fix first :P
[07:23:03] <Fogest> pauled, if you want to append a button why not use .append()
[07:24:07] <pauled> Fogest, it's in next step, trying to understand the toggle() to change the state of a button
[07:24:29] <NCS_One> Fogest: right
[07:24:59] <Fogest> pauled, can you tell me what it is that you want to do and I can help you figure out the correct function you need to use?
[07:25:22] <Fogest> NCS_One, cross site browser compatibility is pretty important :)
[07:25:46] <pauled> Fogest: yes, making a fiddle
[07:26:07] <Fogest> pauled, okay cool
[07:31:42] <xckpd7> question: I need some help finding a carousel that allows me to render buttons overlapping on the bottom. 1 slide may have 1 button, another may have 2
[07:32:10] <xckpd7> the best jquery carousel plugin as far as I know is slick but I don't know if that's possible with that plugin
[07:40:49] <pauled> Fogest: http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/j9m5pd4j/
[07:43:47] <benjaminschoch> yet another try: some knows how to catch jquery selector calls like $('.element'), rewrite selector i.e. to '.el' and pass it back to jquery selector method? without having to rewrite all $('...') calls?
[07:43:47] <Fogest> pauled, your selector is "control" when it should be ".control". The .toggle should be done in the function. I'll alter it one sec
[07:44:49] <pauled> ah yes, wow it dispear now :))
[07:45:04] <ramsub07> hello people, I have a form and bunch of input elements inside it. I'm filtering all the input and select fields by .find('input, select') . I've a couple of radio buttons in the form which i want to exclude. Is there any way by which I could do that ?
[07:46:19] <Fogest> pauled, why not have the button in the original html?
[07:46:48] <pauled> because it's an userscript, I can't control the serverside
[07:47:04] <benjaminschoch> ramsub07: what about .find('input[type=text], select')
[07:47:06] <Fogest> pauled, ahh
[07:47:09] <pauled> Making a GM script
[07:47:43] <ramsub07> benjaminschoch: there are choices field there as well, so could I avoid that also ?

[07:48:04] <benjaminschoch> ramsub07: .find('input[type=text], input[type=checkbox], select')
[07:48:17] <Fogest> pauled, modifying it still hangon
[07:48:20] <ramsub07> benjaminschoch: yeah, thanks
[07:50:08] <ramsub07> but couldn't this be done in the other way, like excluding what's not necessary ?
[07:50:12] <ramsub07> benjaminschoch:
[07:50:49] <benjaminschoch> ramsub07: with a find('...').not('input[type=radio]')
[07:51:29] <benjaminschoch> ramsub07: but it would be slower
[07:52:59] <Fogest> pauled, sorry I am taking so long
[07:53:30] <pauled> it's fine, I am trying in another way
[07:53:55] <ramsub07>  benjaminschoch , hmm fine
[07:54:17] <ramsub07> I'll do this way, but for knowledge's sake, could you please tell me how to do that ?
[07:54:17] <Fogest> pauled, how about this: http://fiddle.jshell.net/j9m5pd4j/2/
[07:54:40] <pauled> also here is mine http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/j9m5pd4j/3/
[07:55:37] <Fogest> pauled, that way will work too. I used the .hasClass() method. Also your chaining together or the .removeClass() and .addClass() was a valid method like you had before.
[07:55:40] <benjaminschoch> ramsub07: how to do what? I just wrote the alternative method to filter specific selectors via .not() on a collection
[07:56:28] <kavi> hi how do i refer to an element inside the attribute : say if i have < a href="http://google.com" rel="test[photo][<p> <a href="http://cnn.com" title"> </p>]"> i want to insert some text after [photo]
[07:56:37] <pauled> Fogest: can be done with toggleClass?
[07:56:46] <kavi> what is the selector i should use?
[07:58:03] <pauled> kavi: $('a[href='http://google.com'")
[07:59:04] <kavi> how does this work ? i want to talk to an element inside the rel attribute
[07:59:49] <decx> selector is there to select elements, not properties
[08:00:00] <decx> prop('rel') will have it
[08:00:10] <kavi> i want to say something like $('a[rel ['p']] ).insertBefore
[08:00:17] <decx> no
[08:00:58] <decx> why does that rel include html anyway?
[08:01:01] <decx> that's ridiculous
[08:01:10] <kavi> decx : prop('rel') will have the entire text rite?
[08:01:30] <kavi> tats how lightbox insert elements
[08:01:35] <decx> shit lightbox then
[08:01:46] <decx> or just old
[08:01:58] <decx> like 10 years old
[08:05:32] <Fogest> pauled, toggleClass() is to toggle the class, not change it to another one.
[08:06:18] <decx> both works
[08:06:26] <pauled> Fogest: I see. thanks, I will use RemoveClass/AddClass then, thanks :)
[08:06:35] <decx> class="blah" -> toggleClass('blah notblah') -> class="notblah"
[08:06:59] <Fogest> pauled, decx has a point that toggleClass could be used.
[08:07:29] <pauled> it remove the first node?
[08:07:42] <decx> if it's there and is toggled it's gone
[08:07:43] <Fogest> pauled, well it toggles every class that is there
[08:08:19] <pauled> no it keep class="notblah"
[08:08:31] <decx> because it wasnt there before
[08:08:36] <decx> hence the toggling
[08:08:36] <pauled> ah yes
[08:08:43] <pauled> sorry ;)
[08:08:50] <pauled> ah cool
[08:09:15] <Fogest> pauled, http://fiddle.jshell.net/j9m5pd4j/4/
[08:09:55] <pauled> wow nice !! in one line !!! :)))
[08:10:15] <pauled> Thanks decx Fogest
[08:10:44] <decx> that's my good deed for the day, back to pushing old ladies down stairs and doing drugs
[08:12:55] <pauled> hehe
[08:14:14] <Fogest> decx, please don't push me down the stairs
[08:17:19] <amunak> hello, I have a <tbody> element with <tr class="no-data"></tr> inside. When I call .remove() on the tbody, the tr disappears. When I call tbody.remove('.no-data'), it remains. How is that possible?
[08:18:29] <decx> remove without argument will remove the callee, with argument it'll kill that instead
[08:18:38] <decx> iirc
[08:18:58] <shoky> amunak: tbody.remove('.no-data')  means:  remove tbody if it has class no-data
[08:19:13] <amunak> oh... so I need like childNodes there
[08:19:15] <amunak> Im dumb
[08:19:22] <decx> ah right
[08:19:25] <decx> that was it
[08:20:53] <faulix> Hello guys
[08:23:13] <Fogest> faulix, hi
[08:24:03] <faulix> I hope it's fine that I approach you with a problem of a website I develop right now: http://c2m.stefankuhn.biz/what-we-accomplished - I want that the text hides/shows when I click on the list-item and use toggle for that. If I try my code standalone it works totally fine, but on that site somehow it doesn't work at all and I tested so much (hours) and I have no idea why. Hopefully someone can give me some hints (don't expect final so
[08:25:58] <robertmaxrees> faulix that cut off for me.
[08:26:19] <robertmaxrees> faulix share the test case in a fiddle - even if it works, it'll point us in a direction.
[08:26:31] <faulix> You mean the text was too long?
[08:26:38] <robertmaxrees> yes, your message was too long.
[08:26:45] <robertmaxrees> not realy important though :)
[08:27:14] <kavi> hmm may be but i need to find a way to talk to html element inside the attribute ..is it possible ?
[08:27:44] <faulix> http://c2m.stefankuhn.biz/what-we-accomplished - I want that the text hides/shows when I click on the list-item and use toggle() for that.
[08:27:56] <robertmaxrees> faulix shoe me the test case you mae that works.
[08:27:57] <faulix> If I try my code standalone it works totally fine, but on that site somehow it doesn't work at all and I tested so much (hours) and I have no idea why.
[08:28:03] <faulix> okay wait ;)
[08:28:08] <robertmaxrees> faulix oh.
[08:28:09] <robertmaxrees> nvm.
[08:28:11] <robertmaxrees> open your console ;)
[08:28:49] <faulix> javascript console of chrome?
[08:28:55] <faulix> you mean the developer tool?
[08:28:55] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[08:28:58] <robertmaxrees> yes
[08:29:23] <Fogest> faulix, you have a syntax error
[08:29:36] <faulix> lol I didn't see that before O.o how embarassing
[08:29:48] <faulix> a ")" missing
[08:29:48] <robertmaxrees> faulix you either don't have jquery loaded or you're in noconflict.
[08:30:30] <robertmaxrees> I'm getitng a "$ is not a function" error
[08:33:05] <robertmaxrees> oh, you have 2 copies of jquery, faulix
[08:33:22] <robertmaxrees> you're double-loading a lot of things, actually.
[08:34:19] <faulix> so what should I do now
[08:34:33] <robertmaxrees> remove the duplicate scripts.
[08:34:48] <faulix> because that case I never had.so I have it loaded twice most probably with noconflict and that's why it doesn't load?
[08:35:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:36:55] <faulix> I don't see 2, I load 1.11 and 1.2 migrate, isn't the migrate exactly to make it compatible with new version?
[08:37:28] <faulix> ah now I see it, sorry
[08:37:31] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[08:39:53] <faulix> I cleaned it out, but it doesn't change anything. Why can't I call $(function() {}) at this point and get a syntax error?
[08:40:15] <faulix> or actually a TypeError
[08:40:16] <robertmaxrees> because of noconflict.
[08:40:40] <robertmaxrees> replace $(function() { with jQuery(function(e) {
[08:40:46] <robertmaxrees> err $(function() { with jQuery(function($) {
[08:41:30] <faulix> So I need to call it with jQuery( document ).ready(function( $ ) { ?
[08:42:08] <robertmaxrees> or just jQuery(function($) {
[08:42:08] <faulix> mine is the long version of your snippet, right?
[08:42:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[08:42:56] <faulix> works, great, thanks :)
[08:43:52] <faulix> now also for my sustainable learning: noconflict ensures that global variables get unset to ensure that other javascript don't create a conflict. that's the reason why I need to call it with jQuery to reference to jQuery global variables. Is that correct?
[08:44:03] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[08:44:04] <robertmaxrees> no.
[08:44:35] <robertmaxrees> all noConflict does is relinquish the $ variable back to whatever had it before jquery ran.
[08:44:37] <faulix> O.o okay then I didn't get it
[08:44:51] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't "unset" any "global variables"
[08:45:15] <faulix> just hide them?
[08:45:29] <robertmaxrees> again, " all noConflict does is relinquish the $ variable back to whatever had it before jquery ran."
[08:45:45] <faulix> ah now I see. thanks :)
[08:45:54] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/ for more.
[08:55:04] <pauled> can I toggle style=""? because I have to overwrite this div.side_box { margin-left: 0px!important; width: 196px!important;}
[08:57:10] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to toggle?
[08:57:18] <robertmaxrees> like, why are you removing the styles?
[09:02:09] <pauled> I want to change the width to 100% with !important but since the site use !important I can't overwrite to 100% until I write it in style=""
[09:02:24] <robertmaxrees> err.
[09:03:22] <arc_> the joys of working on a site you have no control over
[09:04:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hhk05etw/
[09:04:04] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the issue is.
[09:05:32] <arc_> me either
[09:06:22] <pauled> robertmaxrees: here I have function to toggle class, but want in it to toggle style too http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/j9m5pd4j/
[09:06:51] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[09:06:52] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:06:59] <arc_> lol
[09:07:13] <pauled> in $('button.control').click(function () {
[09:07:20] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/robertmaxrees/j9m5pd4j/11/
[09:07:54] <robertmaxrees> don't leave in commented out code, yo.
[09:07:59] <robertmaxrees> and this isn't really a test case.
[09:08:42] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're trying to solve?
[09:09:12] <arc_> it's always better to describe what you're trying to do than how you're trying to do it
[09:09:15] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:09:36] <robertmaxrees> on account of the fact that if you don't understand what's not working, you probably can't describe the details of what's broken.
[09:09:50] <pauled> wait, I will update the code
[09:09:57] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:10:00] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[09:12:57] <kevireilly> pauled: just a heads up, that even with !important, the more specific selector will take precendence. For example, while not a great idea, `body div.class` will take precedence over `div.class` even when it comes to !important declarations
[09:13:19] <robertmaxrees> kevireilly this is inlined
[09:13:57] <kevireilly> kind of sounded like style was being used as a last ditch effort to overcome !important, but I’ll wait for the updated code also ;)
[09:14:01] <pauled> kevireilly robertmaxrees : http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/j9m5pd4j/12/
[09:15:28] <pauled> as you see the 100% width doesn't work
[09:16:35] <pauled> even if you add !important
[09:17:45] <christoph_> hey my ajax request fails, can anybody tell me why ? (is it possible that ajax will abort if it takes to long) ?
[09:17:51] <pauled> oh sorry, it should be like this http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/j9m5pd4j/13/
[09:18:33] <robertmaxrees> pauled right, because of specificity.
[09:18:33] <christoph_> if i use GET instead of POST it works fine but i thought i should use post because of data size
[09:18:41] <LiENUS> anyone familiar with jqueryvalidator.org? it's counting a space in a field as an empty field and im trying to find a way to disable that, it should view a space in a number field as an invalid number
[09:18:49] <NoiseEee> christoph_: christoph_what does the network tab say?  is the backend prepared to deal with a POST even??
[09:19:45] <pauled> ok, Myabe I have to remove/toggle the class .side_box then
[09:19:53] <NCS_One> t
[09:19:59] <NCS_One> sorry
[09:20:03] <robertmaxrees> pauled you're fighting inline styles.
[09:20:25] <robertmaxrees> you need to kill them first - .removeProp('style');
[09:20:37] <robertmaxrees> if you want to restore them later, you'll need to save that property value somewhere.
[09:20:39] <christoph_> NoiseEee, i cant say we use a custom browser
[09:21:02] <NoiseEee> christoph_: well unfortunately the channel crystal ball is broken
[09:21:25] <christoph_> :D
[09:21:32] <NoiseEee> christoph_: but you'll have to analyze the server response somehow, and again, if the API/XHR point is expecting a GET instead of a POST then of course things will not work
[09:21:32] <christoph_> we are using javafx.scene.web.WebView  (webkit)
[09:21:37] <christoph_> but there are no debug tools :D
[09:22:28] <christoph_> both post and get work perfectly fine but in this paticular case not and i do not know why
[09:22:47] <christoph_> i thought the time of execution might be a problem
[09:23:09] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ it can be, but i doubt that's the problem.
[09:23:51] <kidto> I'm a little bit shit a jquery, but I have a website loaded that uses some kind of crazy dynamic angular.js view within a view nonesense, and I can chrome tools inspect elements within it, but I can't select them with the dev tools console using their ids, names, classes, etc. When I select all, they're not in the returned list. Does this sound familliar to anyone?
[09:24:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:24:39] <NoiseEee> christoph_: usually you won't get the .fail() because of a timeout
[09:24:52] <NoiseEee> christoph_: it is also insane to try to debug without debug tools so good luck!
[09:25:18] <christoph_> jeah it is hilarious :D
[09:25:25] <christoph_> and in chrome it works fine
[09:25:29] <christoph_> but thanks anyway
[09:25:30] <kidto> For example, there is a field with id "formField" being rendered. I can inspect it with inspect element, but it's not in the source. It's also not selectable using $("#formField")
[09:25:41] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ fwiw chrome doesn't use webkit any more.
[09:25:58] <christoph_> really ?
[09:26:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah - they forked a few years ago.
[09:26:12] <robertmaxrees> kidto viewing "page source" and using the dev tools are different things.
[09:26:45] <kidto> robertmaxrees: I know, I just said that to illustrate that it's not static, but I can't find it dynamically, either
[09:26:56] <robertmaxrees> kidto you said you can select it using the dev tools.
[09:27:12] <robertmaxrees> kidto are you running that selector in the console?
[09:27:18] <kidto> robertmaxrees: yeah! That's what's confusing me. I can select it with dev tools but not jquery...?
[09:27:28] <robertmaxrees> shadow dom maybe?
[09:27:42] <kidto> robertmaxrees: no, selecting with the right click -> inspect element. It's def. in the rendered html
[09:28:02] <robertmaxrees> right, but what happens if you run that jquery selector in the console?
[09:28:11] <kidto> robertmaxrees: returns [] :(
[09:28:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, sounds like an angular thing then.  i'd ask in the angular channel.
[09:28:51] <kidto> robertmaxrees: why angular why D:
[09:29:02] <kidto> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the help <3
[09:30:24] <kevr> is there some type of jquery mechanism for waiting for something to be done animating before executing?
[09:30:42] <robertmaxrees> .done()
[09:30:48] <kevr> oh, oh i see
[09:30:51] <kevr> thanks.
[09:30:51] <robertmaxrees> jquery animations use promises.
[09:30:57] <kevr> nice.
[09:32:08] <kevr> looks like i still need to keep some type of safeguard so it doesn't execute more than it should.
[09:32:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:32:17] <kevr> mm, i'll figure it out. .done() is legit, thank you.
[09:33:24] <kevr> robertmaxrees: basically, i have a keyup bind on an input text field that checks its contents against some database, and shows a green check or a red x, kinda like taken username thing
[09:33:43] <kevr> it's working, it's just not graceful.
[09:34:26] <robertmaxrees> debounce it.
[09:34:34] * Fogest bounces
[09:39:50] <kevr> i see, interesting
[09:39:52] <kevr> thanks, again
[09:45:29] <pauled> chrome console are evil http://i.imgur.com/RSkY6zV.png
[09:46:12] <pantsofchocolate> anyone ever have problems with affix bottom having to be negative or is that a new standard?
[09:46:27] <NoiseEee> pauled: why, what SHOULD it look like when you're set up that way?
[09:46:32] <NoiseEee> pauled: detach that thing man
[09:46:44] <NoiseEee> or do it on a horizontal pane, etc
[09:47:16] <pauled> yeah I was kiding
[09:47:35] <NoiseEee> oh
[09:50:39] <decx> they give you the option to make it that way so making stuff like this unusable is just bad ux
[09:54:05] <pantsofchocolate> lol chrome debug has been very helpful trying to find this affix offset problem except when it gets in the way
[10:15:00] <pauled> there is a scrollbar that are supposed to be under the chatbox, how I can avoid this? http://i.imgur.com/JZiveHc.png
[10:17:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:17:24] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to remove that scrollbar on the side?
[10:20:48] <pauled> you see the red mark?
[10:21:06] <robertmaxrees> yes - you question said something about a scrollbar being "under the chatbox"
[10:21:24] <robertmaxrees> what you asked and the screenshot are incongruous with one another.
[10:22:18] <pauled> but I mean the scrollbar of a div under the chat fullscreen
[10:23:17] <robertmaxrees> still not making sense lol
[10:29:24] <randomguy1> that is a lot of browser tabs, btw
[10:29:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:29:59] <randomguy1> first thing i've said yet today, and that was it.  *proud*
[10:30:25] <arc_> that's painful
[10:30:38] <arc_> if you can't see favicons, make another window
[10:30:53] <robertmaxrees> or, y'know, close tabs.
[10:31:13] <robertmaxrees> something tells me there are a bunch of SO pages and jquery api docs open there.
[10:31:13] <arc_> it's not even possible to know what tabs to close in that case without going through every single one :p
[10:31:19] <randomguy1> i hear they created a new feature a few days ago.  what was it.... ummm, booooook mark?  maybe?
[10:31:26] <robertmaxrees> declare bankruptcy and start over.
[10:31:31] <arc_> lol
[10:37:34] <pauled> it can't happen with firefox, it has min-size of tab
[10:37:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah that starts scrolling tabs instead, which is almost worse in some ways.
[10:37:58] <robertmaxrees> why do you have every page on the internet open?
[10:40:56] <pauled> Because I don't close it. Why I don't close it? Because you can't bookmark a text area, and also it's a session. I will not bookmark everything I browse
[10:41:05] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:44:11] <pauled> wow I have 82 tabs :>
[10:44:31] <pauled> It does not look like that :))
[10:44:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's a little much.
[10:45:02] <randomguy1> for some reason I feel like 'tab' isn't appropriate anymore in this case
[10:45:45] <pauled> but now with the Great Suspender extension, that's fine :)
[10:45:50] <randomguy1> maybe once you get so many, at that point you just have tubs
[10:46:00] <randomguy1> sounds bigger
[10:47:05] <randomguy1> GS ext?  crap, your going to make me google
[10:47:34] <arc_> it just automatically takes tabs out of memory when you don't use them for a while
[10:47:43] <randomguy1> cool
[11:07:31] <Ryein> how can i redirect to a specific page after ajax success?
[11:07:46] <Ryein> i tried window.location.replace(""); but it isn't working
[11:08:08] <robertmaxrees> window.location.href = 'someurl.com'
[11:09:21] <gambl0re> whatever you can do in jquery you can do the exact same in javascript except that it may be harder?
[11:09:34] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re basically?
[11:10:07] <randomguy1> gambl0re: jquery also handles some of the browser different ways of accomplishing the same goal
[11:11:03] <gambl0re> im learning javascript now. is it best that i skip all the DOM and events and just laern that in jquery?
[11:11:25] <robertmaxrees> you should know both.
[11:12:13] <gambl0re> really?
[11:12:20] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[11:12:29] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a library, it's not a replacement for the language.
[11:25:04] <Ryein> my ajax is getting an error but ajax request is still working
[11:26:17] <Ryein> status 200 OK
[11:26:23] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[11:27:07] <Ryein> should i just remove this for an empty response? dataType:"json",
[11:27:17] <Ryein> or should I always have a response?
[11:27:23] <robertmaxrees> you should always have a response.
[11:27:26] <Ryein> ok
[11:27:45] <robertmaxrees> if it's empty, send back valid empty JSON
[11:29:00] <Ryein> robertmaxrees, thanks works great
[11:30:55] <scrandaddy> Hello. Is there a way to change the default window object that jQuery uses?
[11:31:01] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[11:31:14] <robertmaxrees> scrandaddy why are you trying to do it?
[11:31:20] <scrandaddy> I need to manipulate the parent dom from an iframe my script is loaded into.
[11:31:55] <robertmaxrees> you need to reference window.parent.document
[11:32:27] <robertmaxrees> that assumes you have access to the parent frame, btw.
[11:32:49] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: I should, it's all on the same domain
[11:33:01] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, just access through window.parent.document
[11:33:21] <robertmaxrees> $(window.parent.document).find('.someElement').html('lol');
[11:34:05] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: I am reusing a library built without that assumption in mind
[11:34:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:34:34] <scrandaddy> is there a safe way to override the root window that jquery uses?
[11:34:40] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:34:45] <robertmaxrees> because that's now how you do that.
[11:34:53] <robertmaxrees> you want to access the window.parent.document
[11:35:02] <robertmaxrees> not override anything.
[11:35:36] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: ok, i think i see what  you're saying
[11:35:53] <robertmaxrees> you literally can do $(window.parent.document) and access the parent window
[11:36:07] <scrandaddy> i was worried about jquery internally referencing window, but trying to operate on window.parent
[11:36:15] <robertmaxrees> no, that won't be an issue.
[11:36:30] <scrandaddy> perfect, thanks for clarifying!
[11:36:40] <robertmaxrees> well, it shouldn't be - you won't have access to the plugins and things from the parent window.
[11:36:57] <robertmaxrees> if you need to access those, you should go through window.parent.document.$() instead.
[11:38:03] <randomguy1> might be useful for the child to trigger an event in the parent, at which point all it's work would be in the parent scope
[11:38:12] <ramsub07> hello guys,new to jquery, I've a form and two buttons in the form. If I submit by clicking one button, I need action1 to happen and if button 2 is clicked, I need action 2
[11:38:28] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ ramsub07
[11:38:40] <robertmaxrees> awww bat b-ot.
[11:38:50] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 http://jsfiddle.net/ - setup an example here :)
[11:39:13] <Fogest> .paste
[11:39:13] <b-ot> Fogest: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:39:24] <robertmaxrees> wtf why'd the b-ot shortcut change?
[11:39:29] <Fogest> !paste
[11:39:29] <b-ot> Fogest: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:39:38] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ robertmaxrees
[11:39:39] <Fogest> Both of them :P
[11:39:48] <Fogest> !paste @ robertmaxrees
[11:39:51] <Fogest> hmm
[11:39:51] <robertmaxrees> so the @ is busted.
[11:39:52] <robertmaxrees> lame.
[11:40:03] <Fogest> The docs website doesn't work either
[11:40:06] <Fogest> !commands
[11:40:06] <b-ot> Fogest: http://bot-t.com/docs/
[11:40:43] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[11:40:46] <snover> b-ot: how dumb are you?
[11:40:46] <b-ot> snover: outlook good.
[11:41:27] <Fogest> And since I can't find docs on it I don't even know if there is any github repo I could grab to run a fixed bot from.
[11:41:53] <Fogest> .paste robertmaxrees
[11:42:28] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees:  http://jsfiddle.net/xxvmo2bj/
[11:43:11] <Fogest> ramsub07, can't you use a $("selector").click() on them?
[11:43:21] <robertmaxrees> that's not what he's asking.
[11:43:25] <Fogest> ah
[11:43:46] <robertmaxrees> he needs to get the one that was clicked.
[11:44:12] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: +1
[11:44:36] <randomguy1> if they were actual submit button, wouldn't the clicked name, value pair be passed to the back end?
[11:44:51] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works.
[11:45:52] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of complicated tbh.
[11:46:19] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: would it make it simple if i have a radio button instead ?
[11:46:42] <robertmaxrees> you're kind of stuck with somethng like http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xxvmo2bj/1/
[11:46:50] <robertmaxrees> and then you have to make sure you're using ajax.
[11:46:58] <robertmaxrees> it's smarter if you use a radio, yeah.
[11:50:00] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: does the code that you've pasted differentiates between the two buttons ?
[11:50:22] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 err, all that code does is show you how you'd start with soimething like that.
[11:50:36] <robertmaxrees> you need to look at the element within the click event listener.
[11:51:25] <tswartz> http://jsfiddle.net/uertnh2a/ I want to add a class to the div class "form-group" but only the one with the input id companyPhone. How do I select that form-group div?
[11:51:56] <robertmaxrees> $('#companyPhone')
[11:52:10] <robertmaxrees> since IDs are unique, just select based on that :)
[11:52:29] <tswartz> But I want to select the div that holds that
[11:52:49] <Fogest> .parent() ?
[11:52:52] <robertmaxrees> .parent()
[11:52:55] <tswartz> o_0
[11:52:57] <robertmaxrees> or .closest('div');
[11:53:00] <Wes-> Hi, all. I am trying to use the jquery-ui datepicker.   It works, except it inserts <p><input type="text" id="datepicker"></p>  right in the middle of my document.  Is there a way to control where that paragraph gets inserted, so I can hide it?
[11:53:20] <tswartz> Heh. I just learned something. Thanks guys
[11:53:43] <Fogest> tswartz, good luck :)
[11:55:36] <gtwy> Wes-: dont you use the datepicker by calling $(element).datepicker()
[11:56:04] <gtwy> Wes-: did you look at this? https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[11:57:13] <gtwy> the datepicker will always go where the #id is of the text box you are putting it on
[11:57:29] <gtwy> if done correctly it goes away on its own
[11:57:33] <gtwy> when you click outside the box
[11:57:42] <gtwy> if for some reason you actually need to control it and tell it to go away
[11:57:47] <Wes-> ..........................I'm an idiot. I pasted that into my html source somehow :facepalm:
[11:57:53] <gtwy> the datepicker ID is ui-datepicker-div
[11:57:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:57:59] <robertmaxrees> Wes- ++
[11:57:59] <gtwy> Wes-: glad to hear its resolved
[12:00:15] <Wes-> I can't believe I burned a half-hour RTFMing when I should have read my own damn code. LOL. Where did that COME from?!!
[12:00:52] <gtwy> if you read the manual for 30 minutes it wasnt time wasted
[12:00:53] <gtwy> you learned
[12:01:02] <gtwy> and if you already knew most of that stuff you strengthened your knwoeledge
[12:02:07] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I have a very weird question, please forgive me in advance if I can't explain well :)
[12:02:18] <robertmaxrees> pauled 2 things
[12:02:23] <kevr> debounce is a plugin?
[12:02:53] <pauled> robertmaxrees: it's possible to grab and keep a div from a page to another one?
[12:03:07] <robertmaxrees> that's highly dependent.
[12:03:13] <robertmaxrees> but there are over 750 people in the channel
[12:03:18] <robertmaxrees> no need to address me directly ;)
[12:03:25] <pauled> robertmaxrees: yeah sorry
[12:03:34] <robertmaxrees> kevr it's more of a technique.  there are plugins and stuff out there though.
[12:03:50] <kevr> ah, gotcha
[12:04:56] <gambl0re> does javascript count the months starting from 0?
[12:05:08] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re like many other languages, yes.
[12:05:16] <pauled> so I retry to everone: it's possible to grab and keep a div from a page to another one? it's a local html page chat box want to keep on every page I browse on the same site
[12:05:33] <robertmaxrees> pauled you want the box to persist, you mean?
[12:05:38] <robertmaxrees> and not reload?
[12:05:39] <pauled> yeah
[12:05:43] <robertmaxrees> that involves ajax.
[12:06:07] <pauled> yeah that need be updated of course
[12:06:12] <pauled> it'a a chab box
[12:06:16] <pauled> chat*
[12:06:28] <robertmaxrees> right - the entire rest of the page would need to be ajaxed in and out.
[12:06:55] <Fogest> Or you could allow it to reload and store data in html5 storage?
[12:07:08] <robertmaxrees> except that then the box will reload with each page change.
[12:07:34] <Fogest> Correct.
[12:07:50] <Fogest> iframe lol
[12:07:53] <Wes-> or, if you're willing to go old-school (and probably compromise your layout) .... put the chat page in one frame and the rest of the site in another
[12:08:02] <pauled> My goal is to make a chat box from a chessboard to everyone use the greasemonkey userscript
[12:09:24] <Wes-> Fogest: reload with each page change can lose messages..depending what the back end of the chat engine is
[12:09:31] <pauled> yes frame may be an option
[12:10:15] <Fogest> Wes-, well not if you're storing the logged messages in an html5 storage and playing them back.
[12:10:27] <pauled> there is similar script that use ajax for my goal?
[12:11:12] <Wes-> Fogest: you can't store messages you don't receive - if the message transmission doesn't have a way to ensure that clients receive each message, messages that are sent during page reload get lost
[12:12:13] <Fogest> Wes-, yeah but ideally you could make a ajax call to get the chat messages
[12:12:34] <gtwy> i never really thought about this
[12:12:39] <gtwy> how does facebook do it
[12:12:43] <gtwy> the URL bar clearly changes
[12:12:47] <gtwy> yet the chat window stays up
[12:12:50] <Wes-> Fogest: that depends entirely on the back end.  Something analogous to IRC, for example, will not be able to do that because messages are not stored centrally.
[12:13:07] <gambl0re> could somebody take a look at this code and tell me why the discounted price isnt being caluclated. thanks http://jsbin.com/qowixofige/2/edit?js,console
[12:13:17] <Wes-> Fogest: A common chat implementation is to broadcast to all connected clients -- that are connected via something like comet (ajax long poll)
[12:13:19] <gtwy> i would guess they are just re-opening the chat window on every page as you browse
[12:13:26] <gtwy> and they are caching all the chat elements in the browsers
[12:13:30] <gtwy> so that it reloads much faster
[12:13:32] <Fogest> gtwy, exactly
[12:14:11] <gtwy> pauled: depending on how much content you have, you could jimmy rig an ajax to change the content of the page
[12:14:18] <gtwy> pauled: but that would mean that /urls/ would be worthless
[12:14:22] <Fogest> Wes-, See I would just send the message to a database and have the clients polling that database every 10 seconds or so.
[12:15:18] <Wes-> Fogest: that means that it takes an average of 5s for clients to receive messages....it also means, potentially, a lot of storage
[12:15:29] <randomguy1> unless websockets are an option, :)
[12:15:39] <gtwy> pauled: id recommend using a pre-built xmpp javascript chat
[12:15:40] <Wes-> Fogest: if you want persistent chat across reloads with fast updates, usually a blend of both techniques is used
[12:15:43] <gtwy> ive used them beforfe
[12:15:49] <gtwy> maybe not your end-all solution
[12:15:53] <gtwy> but see how its done
[12:15:55] <gtwy> and how it works
[12:16:07] <Fogest> gambl0re, which line is not working in here?
[12:16:35] <pauled> gtwy: I can't use another chat system, because we will lose users profile/name
[12:16:45] <gtwy> pauled: set it up as test
[12:16:56] <gtwy> find a good xmpp chat system with lots of documentation
[12:16:59] <gtwy> see how *they* solved it
[12:17:57] <gtwy> https://conversejs.org/
[12:18:11] <gtwy> https://www.jsxc.org/
[12:18:23] <Wes-> XMPP solves a lot of their problems with server smarts....I don't think they support offline message storage, though. But I could be wrong, been a long time since I've worked with that stuff.
[12:18:30] <pauled> gtwy: I see, but I do not have enough sharpened eyes to discern the correct code.
[12:19:02] <robertmaxrees> pauled you've been in here a lot lately with a pretty broad range of questions.
[12:19:08] <gtwy> its kind of an edge case
[12:19:11] <robertmaxrees> you sure you don't need to hire a developer or something?
[12:19:20] <gtwy> and you will be hard to find someone with that exact way of doing it
[12:19:33] <Fogest> robertmaxrees, pretty sure he is just making a userscript to work with a website
[12:19:34] <gtwy> so my advice would be to attempt to implement one of those temporarily for test purposes
[12:19:37] <gtwy> see how it behaves
[12:19:42] <gtwy> and then code from there
[12:20:18] <robertmaxrees> Fogest i'm well aware, but he seems less interested in learning anything and more interested in his particular use case.
[12:20:38] <Fogest> robertmaxrees, yes that is true.
[12:22:01] <pauled> but I am not professional, I need concrete case that interest me
[12:22:26] <robertmaxrees> pauled are you interested in learning how to code though?
[12:23:08] <gtwy> pauled: just throwing this out there but im sure someone in here would be willing to take on contract work to get whatever youre doing done for you
[12:23:08] <pauled> yes, but learning something I like to use
[12:23:27] <robertmaxrees> gtwy i usually discourage people setting up contracts in here fwiw :)
[12:23:43] <gtwy> robertmaxrees: why? get burned before?
[12:23:51] <robertmaxrees> it's counter to the purpose of the room.
[12:24:22] <gtwy> i know, but if he isnt interested in learning, the room also isn't a place to have others code for you
[12:24:28] <robertmaxrees> exactly ;)
[12:24:33] <MikeD_> does the "this" object get changed by calls inside a deferred's .done() / promise.resolve() ?
[12:24:46] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ it can, yes.
[12:25:16] <pauled> eh, I am learning, currently I made with the room help and internet a couple of userscript
[12:25:17] <Fogest> robertmaxrees, I didn't know you were a mod here. Do mods in this channel not have OP status?
[12:25:24] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: if I have two radio buttons and a normal button inside a form, I need actionA of radio button A is selected and action B if radio button B is selected. When the button is clicked, the form is submitted. how do I proceed ?
[12:25:35] <robertmaxrees> Fogest like all of freenode, we only op when we need to use it.
[12:25:45] <robertmaxrees> instead of being opped all the time.
[12:26:02] <Fogest> ah okay!
[12:26:09] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 update the fiddle :)
[12:26:16] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: sure
[12:26:52] <robertmaxrees> pauled i'd suggest then that you pair down your problems to test cases.  screenshots and full copies of pages aren't really good test cases.
[12:29:47] <xckpd7> anyone good with slick carousel? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30514577/slick-carousel-buttons-inside-of-slick-carousel-that-can-overlay-the-carousel
[12:29:51] <pauled> live site then :p
[12:29:59] <robertmaxrees> pauled not live sites, either.
[12:30:22] <hiMMm> hey what is the right speed for programmers to be typing on? I'm on 60 WPS and I kinda feel bad about that.
[12:30:45] <arthurvr> hiMMm: you shouldn’t care to much I’d say
[12:31:00] <gtwy> hiMMm: typing CODE?
[12:31:08] <robertmaxrees> pauled http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions - this should be a good place to start :)
[12:31:20] <hiMMm> gtwy: no regular text
[12:31:26] <robertmaxrees> i side with arthurvr on that one - programming is much more about problem solving, not about typing.
[12:31:46] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/9yzpvnp3/
[12:31:50] <gtwy> hiMMm: i type pretty quick. it doesnt help me code though
[12:32:07] <arthurvr> you get better at it in time, hiMMm. Typing fast is an adventage but if you want to be more productive try to improve other tooling.
[12:32:08] <gtwy> hiMMm: especially since i use auto complete to fill in function names anyways
[12:32:11] <pauled> oh god yet another tab of the 82 :D
[12:32:26] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 "then need to perform .submit() on different //.attr(). " - could you clarify this?
[12:32:46] <hiMMm> no but really what speed are you guys on? would love to know that. It will make me care less I guess
[12:32:53] <randomguy1> the tubs return!
[12:33:24] <gtwy> hiMMm: when doing easy words that i know i have hit 150wpm, when doing a "real" typing test with big words / hard to spell words, its more like 100
[12:33:29] <randomguy1> hiMMm: i don't track my typing speed.  i track my solution accuracy
[12:33:39] <gtwy> hiMMm: ive never come close to those speeds when porogramming
[12:33:47] <randomguy1> hiMMm: and the bosses are pretty happy so far
[12:33:50] <gtwy> hiMMm: im also captain typo in chat
[12:34:20] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: something like ,                     $("form").attr('action','{{SITE_ROOT}}/search/plot/dump/').submit(); for one radio button and $("form").attr('action','{{SITE_ROOT}}/search/plot/save/').submit(); for the second radio button
[12:34:47] <gtwy> ramsub07: make a jsfiddle please
[12:34:55] <Uhkis> hiMMm: what test are you using
[12:34:56] <robertmaxrees> gtristan he did.
[12:35:03] <robertmaxrees> err, gtwy http://jsfiddle.net/9yzpvnp3/
[12:35:10] <arthurvr> again you shouldn’t care but if that makes you feel better I was around 70 WPM years ago and it just improved w/o I had to do anything for that. I think I’m around 100 too these days.
[12:35:15] <robertmaxrees> Ramaniscence that doens't make sense.
[12:35:21] <hiMMm> motivates me. thanks arthurvr
[12:35:29] <hiMMm> and gtwy ;))
[12:35:32] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 what are you actually trying to do?  change the URL you're submitting to?
[12:35:43] <ramsub07> yeah
[12:35:54] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 i'd avoid that.
[12:36:03] <ramsub07> actually both of them triggers a download, one for a .png file, the other for a .tsv file
[12:36:07] <gtwy> ramsub07: one sec
[12:36:09] <arthurvr> hiMMm: if you feel like you’re not productive enough just try to improve your tooling (editor, grunt, tests, whatever..)
[12:36:20] <arthurvr> so much more time to save there
[12:36:20] <robertmaxrees> submit to one url and have your backend decide what to do based on the value of the radio instead.
[12:36:39] <Uhkis> always with the testing! :)
[12:36:49] <randomguy1> m-po-tant
[12:36:50] <arthurvr> Uhkis: ;)
[12:37:28] <arthurvr> I think you’ll save so much more time by getting to know your editor better than by spending hours trying to type faster.
[12:37:29] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9yzpvnp3/1/
[12:37:37] <robertmaxrees> it'd roughly look like this with what you're trying to do though.
[12:37:41] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr ++
[12:38:12] <hiMMm> ok so my conclusion is that I shouldn't care - thanks all of you
[12:38:18] <randomguy1> i luvs me some intellij
[12:38:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, intellij, ecplipse, visual studio, sublime text...  knowing one (or many!) of those tools can make your life so much easier.
[12:40:21] <pauled> robertmaxrees: http://www.twitch.tv/chesswhiz on visual studio programming chess application
[12:40:32] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[12:40:45] <gtwy> ramsub07: http://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/9yzpvnp3/2/
[12:40:48] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: can that code distinguish which radio button is selected before the submit button is pressed ? If so, could you please explain me with something like an if statement there ?
[12:41:05] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 you really need to hit up learn.jquery.com
[12:41:10] <gtwy> ramsub07: i like robertmaxrees's more
[12:41:18] <gtwy> ramsub07: i may have misunderstood what you were trying to do
[12:41:41] <ramsub07> gtwy: yes, i wanted what you sent me
[12:41:52] <robertmaxrees> don't do it on submit fwiw.
[12:41:53] <hiMMm> do you think it's valuable to learn vim for example?
[12:41:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9yzpvnp3/3/
[12:42:01] <robertmaxrees> hiMMm if you want to use it.
[12:42:04] <arthurvr> I love vim but am not the right one to answer that question. I haven’t toyed much with other editors since quite a while. Also don’t think it will improve your productivity in a really really serious way.
[12:42:06] <randomguy1> can be handy
[12:42:10] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: agreed, it was today that I've started learning something that people in this room have been doing for years :)
[12:42:20] <randomguy1> nano is also nice
[12:42:30] <robertmaxrees> ramsub07 right, that;'s why learn.jquery.com is great :)
[12:42:30] <Uhkis> no it's not :D
[12:42:34] <robertmaxrees> gets you up to speed ;)
[12:42:36] <gtwy> ramsub07: if you dont actually need to submit a form, just use <button> and do on click
[12:43:03] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees++ :)
[12:43:18] <robertmaxrees> actually http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9yzpvnp3/4/ - ramsub07 but look at this.  better event choice.
[12:43:22] <randomguy1> heh, robertmaxrees is mutable
[12:43:23] <Uhkis> hiMMm: you need a bunch of plugins to vim in order it to be more efficient than <idehere>
[12:43:24] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: sure ! :)
[12:43:24] <ramsub07> gtwy , I was like that previously and I didn't like
[12:45:04] <arthurvr> Uhkis: hiMMm: just want to add to what Uhkis said that you really don’t need to deal with all those plugins from the beginning. Some people provide their awesome vim config online and open source.
[12:45:26] <arthurvr> though you know I really don’t feel like a vim vs {{ randomIDE() }} discussion today
[12:45:51] <hiMMm> thanks for the wise advise.
[12:46:07] <Uhkis> yeah, like https://github.com/Uhkis/dotfiles/blob/arch/.vimrc :D
[12:46:35] <Uhkis> i should really update that..
[12:46:39] <arthurvr> Uhkis: your vimrc is 21 lines really? lol
[12:46:49] <arthurvr> I think mine is about to reach 500 lollipop
[12:47:04] <gtwy> robertmaxrees: on change, i like it
[12:47:11] <gtwy> robertmaxrees: i need to go update some forms i have now
[12:47:13] <robertmaxrees> gtwy that's the "right" event here.
[12:47:17] <robertmaxrees> for inputs, at least.
[12:47:44] <hiMMm> I am going to /part
[12:47:56] <Uhkis> arthurvr: gotta recheck tomorrow when i get back to work, altough i am fine with a lot of plugin defaults
[12:48:05] <gtwy> ramsub07: if you are using a form why do you need to do anything with js
[12:48:19] <gtwy> ramsub07: why not just POST it and then have the PHP / back end look at which was clicked
[12:48:20] <robertmaxrees> ^ i started asking this earlier.
[12:48:28] <robertmaxrees> *look at the value of that radio.
[12:48:51] <ramsub07> gtwy: i was working on what you just said for the past 2 days almost, it became more complex and blew up..
[12:50:25] <gtwy> ramsub07: is your form larger than what youre showing here
[12:50:32] <gtwy> or is this it
[12:50:45] <robertmaxrees> even if it's larger, it should be trivial to handle it server-side.
[12:51:13] <ramsub07> gtwy: it's larger, didn't copy paste those stuffs as it'd make you guys read more redundant code
[12:51:52] <gtwy> ramsub07: do you know about this php code:
[12:52:04] <gtwy> header ('Location: http://whatever');
[12:52:37] <ramsub07> gtwy: I don't know PHP, I use django :)
[12:52:43] <gtwy> oh
[12:54:13] <Wes-> parseInt("sdflkj")
[12:56:32] <ilhami> sdjsodjosadjosdoa
[12:58:39] <hiMMm> ilhami: good to know thank you
[13:04:41] <ilhami> hehe
[13:15:43] <bojanglz> Hey there. Is there a way to override jQuery to always be called in a given context?
[13:16:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:16:15] <bojanglz> such that $('#myDiv') is called the same as $('#myDiv', myContext)?
[13:16:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:18:07] <testerbit> I'm looking at https://medicaid-genius.com/ and wondering why when clicking on "features" features does not get highlighted on initial click, only after click when navigation menu changes?
[13:22:57] <Kartagis> if JSON.stringify(textStatus) is giving me status among many others, how do I capture that?
[13:24:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:24:26] <robertmaxrees> don't pass it through stringify
[13:25:19] <robertmaxrees> testerbit probably bad js that's not detecting the way it should.
[13:25:39] <robertmaxrees> oh there are two navigations on that site.
[13:25:53] <arc_> scroll activate doesn't work until you scroll down and click on one of the popup nav buttons
[13:26:03] <arc_> then scroll activate works, unless you go back up and click on one of the top nav buttons
[13:26:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's a funky setup.
[13:26:16] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/8bn5dn4r/2/
[13:26:16] <NCS_One> hi
[13:26:32] <arc_> normally it responsively moves the top nav into the popup nav position
[13:26:36] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: give it any credentials
[13:26:38] <arc_> so you dont' get conflicts like this
[13:26:39] <Kartagis> false
[13:26:40] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:26:42] <NCS_One> so on chrome browser "option" elements are not draggable?
[13:26:44] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis uh...
[13:26:50] <robertmaxrees> why are you asking me and not the channel?
[13:26:50] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/8bn5dn4r/2/
[13:26:55] <NCS_One> https://jsfiddle.net/pLoyja2g/
[13:29:13] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis literally no reason to use JSON.stringify in any of those cases.
[13:29:42] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8bn5dn4r/3/
[13:30:06] <robertmaxrees> textStatus is already text, errorThrown is already text, and you want the status property off of XMLHttpRequest
[13:31:03] <Kartagis> sorry, it was xmlhttprequest
[13:31:05] <Kartagis> aye
[13:31:31] <arc_> this site has jquery.nav.js and headhesive.js and doesn't seem to be using either one as far as i can tell
[13:37:08] <testerbit> arc_ which site are you referring to?
[13:37:20] <arc_> yours, but i found where it's using it
[13:38:42] <arc_> so don't you need to put "scrollChange = true"
[13:38:46] <arc_> it defaults to false
[13:39:46] <testerbit> arc_: for which function?
[13:40:17] <arc_> $('.learn-more').onePageNav({
[13:40:30] <arc_> sorry, no. $('.navigation-bar').onePageNav({
[13:40:47] <arc_> idk why there are multiple onepagenavs AND also headhesive
[13:40:50] <testerbit> scrollChange : true? or changeHash: true?
[13:41:03] <arc_> scrollChange: true
[13:41:03] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: I needed statusCode: { 401: function() { alert('Wrong credentials'); }},
[13:41:48] <arc_> changeHash presumably makes it put the # into the address bar
[13:43:33] <testerbit> arc_: tried adding scrollChange: true, but same result
[13:44:38] <testerbit> arc_: seems like scrollChange is passed a function?
[13:46:43] <arc_> i don't know. the documentation for this plugin is not great
[13:47:39] <testerbit> arc_: is there another plugin that has better documentation that can be substitutued?
[13:49:07] <arc_> testerbit your real problem is that you have two navbars
[13:49:35] <arc_> you click on one, and expect the other to change
[13:50:27] <NCS_One> s there some good plugin like http://loudev.com/    but with drag and drop, and buttons to move all?
[13:50:55] <testerbit> arc_: in the html it seems there is one navigation-bar
[13:51:49] <arc_> <nav class="navigation navigation-header fixmenu-clone fixmenu-unstick">
[13:51:52] <arc_> is separate from
[13:52:02] <arc_> <nav class="navigation navigation-header">
[13:52:24] <arc_> the first one is what appears when you scroll down
[13:56:13] <arc_> i don't quite understand why the scrolling change doesn't work until after you click on one of the nav bars
[13:59:07] <arc_> actually ... it works now
[13:59:12] <arc_> did you change something?
[13:59:34] <arc_> oh, no. it just works on refresh until you click one of the nav bars
[14:01:27] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: the code that you sent me detects if either of the radio button is selected or submitted as a request to the form ?
[14:06:13] <testerbit> arc_: I did not change anything
[14:07:25] <arc_> i know
[14:08:45] <arc_> if you reload the page and scroll, it works as expected. there's something about clicking on one of the nav bars that prevents the other nav bar from working properly. i don't know what it is
[14:56:58] <ramsub07> hello guys, how do i check if the radio button inside a form is selected or not ?
[14:58:02] <robertmaxrees> could see if $(':radio:selected').length
[14:58:07] <robertmaxrees> (i think it's selected.
[14:58:14] <Talow> thought it was checked
[14:58:23] <robertmaxrees> or $('form').find(':radio:selected');
[14:58:25] <robertmaxrees> might be checked.
[14:59:46] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: Hello. I went through learnjquery. :) . I now tried what you first said, didn't work. Will try using .find()
[15:00:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah it's checked.
[15:00:18] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r9a06fLf/
[15:01:05] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: how to know which one is checked if I have two ?
[15:01:29] <robertmaxrees> do you understand the concept of a selkectoir?
[15:01:31] <robertmaxrees> *selector
[15:01:47] <ramsub07> I need to do $('#form-id').find('$input=[radio]').val() ?
[15:01:58] <robertmaxrees> woah no.
[15:02:12] <ramsub07> yeah, css selector
[15:02:27] <robertmaxrees> you wanted the one that was chgecked, right?
[15:02:48] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r9a06fLf/2/
[15:02:56] <robertmaxrees> $('form').find(':radio:checked') will get you the checked one.
[15:03:18] <robertmaxrees> if you want to know if ANY were checked, you can look at the .length of that - $('form').find(':radio:checked').length will be 0 if there are none.
[15:03:47] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: okay (y)
[15:03:59] <ramsub07> henceforth, i'll try in console before asking here..
[15:05:00] <ramsub07> ok, that's a json type object and you're getting it's length by .length ?
[15:05:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:05:58] <robertmaxrees> $() is an array-like object.
[15:08:32] <ramsub07> ohh
[15:08:54] <rubyonrailed> How would I scope this form, so the submit function only runs when that form is submitted? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/000427fa294e113bd15f
[15:09:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:09:59] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed what do you mean "scope this form" - you mean bind your listener to ONLY that form, and no others on the page?
[15:10:06] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: is he referring to having the .on('submit' .. inside $(document).ready(function() ?
[15:10:14] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: Yes, sorry for the confusion
[15:10:19] <robertmaxrees> target the ID.
[15:10:22] <robertmaxrees> it's guaranteed to be unique.
[15:10:29] <robertmaxrees> #edit_user_31960
[15:10:44] <rubyonrailed> Well the id will be different for every user id
[15:10:50] <rubyonrailed> so it could be #edit_user_33
[15:10:59] <robertmaxrees> then i don't understand the question.
[15:11:17] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you want the code in the submit handler to only read code from that particular form?
[15:11:28] <robertmaxrees> err, i mean data from that form.
[15:11:38] <rubyonrailed> I have multiple forms in my app.  I only want use this function when that certain form is submitted, not any other form.
[15:11:53] <robertmaxrees> what makes that form different from the others?
[15:12:00] <robertmaxrees> you need to have something uniquely identifiable about it.
[15:13:17] <ramsub07> robertmaxrees: how do match 2 strings ? if ($a == $b) {} would do ?
[15:13:22] <ramsub07> to*
[15:13:26] <robertmaxrees> use === ramsub07
[15:13:35] <robertmaxrees> if (a === b) {}
[15:13:50] <robertmaxrees> also, convention is to prepend $ onto variables that hold dom elements usually.
[15:13:54] <robertmaxrees> not strings or other data.,
[15:19:54] <NCS_One> hi
[15:20:26] <NCS_One> where can I read more about something like this:   !_.contains...
[15:20:36] <NCS_One> what is the !_
[15:20:38] <NCS_One> ?
[15:21:33] <robertmaxrees> _ is a library called "underscore"
[15:22:10] <robertmaxrees> you can find the docs here
[15:22:11] <robertmaxrees> http://underscorejs.org/
[15:23:47] <NCS_One> robertmaxrees: thanks
[15:33:22] <blindMoe> Can anyone recommend a plugin that will create a fullpage div that pops when scrolling but all the other content under it scrolls like a normal site?  PagePiling.js and FullPage.js both seem to do one or the other
[15:33:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:35:01] <blindMoe> want the initial landing on the page to be a fullscreen div and when the user starts to scroll have it auto scroll to the next section.  This is easily done using pagepiling.js or fullpage.js but the problem is that both of those expect the entire page to work as slides and not have one slide just scroll normally
[15:35:44] <robertmaxrees> ah, so you want a particular slide to have an area that have a scrollbar?
[15:35:47] <wacemindu> Hello. I have a div containing imgs wrapped in a tags. I am listening for clicks on the images, but that is overriding the onclick of the a tags. Is there a way to ensure that the events will continue up to the link?
[15:35:58] <blindMoe> robertmaxrees: yeah basically
[15:36:21] <blindMoe> robertmaxrees: something like this: http://www.etq-amsterdam.com/collection
[15:36:24] <Sal> hey guys, need help to find a bug
[15:36:30] <Sal> i'm getting crazy on it
[15:36:31] <robertmaxrees> blindMoe should be pretty doable.  might need to add a child of that "slide" that's overflow: scroll;
[15:36:50] <Sal> i set a fixed class to a div, but the dicv continues to scroll and doesn't stick
[15:36:53] <robertmaxrees> wacemindu got a fiddle?
[15:37:08] <blindMoe> robertmaxrees: problem I seem to be running into is that when I do that the plugins either break or try to change my scrolling div into a slide
[15:37:24] <robertmaxrees> blindMoe i'd have to see a fiddle at this point then.
[15:37:37] <Sal> don't know if i should ask here or in #css
[15:37:44] <robertmaxrees> Sal probably in #css
[15:37:48] <blindMoe> robertmaxrees: I will try to get one setup.. need to dig through their code a bit to see if I can break it apart.. don't want to waste your time
[15:37:58] <Sal> ok
[15:38:12] <wacemindu> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/j99t8kdy/
[15:39:00] <robertmaxrees> wacemindu that's not how you do that.
[15:39:24] <wacemindu> robertmaxrees: do you recommend a better way?
[15:39:35] <robertmaxrees> and are you using anything like return false; or e.stopImmediatePropagation(); in that img handler?
[15:39:40] <blindMoe> wacemindu: https://jsfiddle.net/j99t8kdy/2/
[15:39:47] <blindMoe> you didn't have jQuery included
[15:40:22] <robertmaxrees> don't use onclick= :(
[15:41:21] <robertmaxrees> but https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j99t8kdy/4/
[15:53:28] <wacemindu> robertmaxrees: ok here's the catch - this is on a client's website that my script is getting loaded onto. I am unable to change that.
[15:53:46] <robertmaxrees> so they have onclick on there?
[15:54:16] <acidjazz> HERE"S THE CATCH i'm usin gonclick=
[15:54:19] <acidjazz> using*
[15:55:24] <Es0teric> how do i load a css file and append it to the <head>?
[15:55:29] <Es0teric> load an external css
[15:55:34] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you append a script tag.
[15:55:41] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees say what?
[15:56:01] <wacemindu> robertmaxrees: yeah, that's right
[15:56:12] <robertmaxrees> $('head').append('<style type="text/css" src="lol.css" />'); Es0teric
[15:56:28] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i have an external css to load
[15:56:40] <robertmaxrees> an external stylesheet, right?
[15:56:41] <Es0teric> so would it be append($.load('path/to/css'))
[15:56:43] <Es0teric> ?
[15:56:47] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:56:49] <robertmaxrees> just append the tag.
[15:56:53] <Es0teric> again
[15:56:56] <Es0teric> its an external css
[15:56:59] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:56:59] <Es0teric> from somewhere else
[15:57:06] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[15:57:06] <Es0teric> oh
[15:57:07] <Es0teric> OH
[15:57:09] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:57:11] <Es0teric> i didnt see the src there
[15:57:15] <Es0teric> lol sorry bout that
[15:57:37] <robertmaxrees> wacemindu https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j99t8kdy/5/
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - that happens by default.
[16:03:55] <Sal> hey
[16:04:09] <Sal> what happens if i continue to add a class that is already addede?
[16:04:16] <robertmaxrees> using .addClass()?
[16:04:18] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[16:04:22] <Sal> a class that contains position: fixed ?
[16:04:27] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[16:04:41] <Sal> does that take off fixed for a sec and then reassigns it?
[16:04:53] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't.
[16:06:11] <Sal> i can't find another reason why a fixed div continues to move around jumping everytime i wheel scroll
[16:06:26] <Sal> getting crazy on this
[16:06:35] <robertmaxrees> did you try not running the addclass?
[16:06:37] <robertmaxrees> if so, did that fix it?
[16:06:49] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees have you worked with google dfp (doubleclick)?
[16:06:57] <Sal> do a hasClass before?
[16:07:07] <Sal> let me try
[16:07:24] <robertmaxrees> Sal addClass checks before doing anything else.
[16:07:33] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric their ad platform? not in a long time.
[16:09:01] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees well i am just trying to include an external stylesheet
[16:09:19] <Es0teric> it seems that dfp doesnt play nice with external stylesheets
[16:10:16] <wacemindu> robertmaxrees: hmm, after messing around a lot it looks like there was a problem with that function in the onclick looking for a certain pattern of elements instead of by selector. got it working now.
[16:10:26] <acidjazz> Es0teric: why in js
[16:10:33] <wacemindu> thanks so much for all your help i wouldn't have a job without you ;)
[16:12:17] <Es0teric> acidjazz because dfp loads ads as iframes
[16:18:53] <sammych> take 2: anyone want to take a look at a problem I'm facing with jQM? https://gist.github.com/sammich/bc1c2957fb2d64f0ffc1
[16:21:14] <robertmaxrees> sammych that's a bug.
[16:21:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd submit that to the jquery mobile site team.
[16:21:44] <sammych> 'site team'?
[16:22:06] <robertmaxrees> or, more specifically, to the repo for the jquery mobile site.
[16:22:21] <sammych> I wasn't sure on the support for old releases
[16:22:29] <sammych> but obviously, it's worth a shot
[16:23:28] <robertmaxrees> at the very worst, they'll say they don't support it any more and tell you "no"
[16:23:46] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com
[16:24:32] <sammych> well, I suspect it's a problem with the release of jQM not the site itself
[16:24:43] <robertmaxrees> it could be either.
[16:24:44] <sammych> (I see what you mean by 'site' team, now. doh)
[16:24:53] <robertmaxrees> but i'd say submit it to the site first.
[16:25:25] <sammych> I have the issue on a production app, so it's not exclusively jqm.com releated
[16:25:33] <robertmaxrees> then you want to link to your app.
[16:25:42] <robertmaxrees> or an isolated test case on your app.
[16:25:49] <sammych> the online demo is my isolated demo
[16:25:53] <robertmaxrees> or otherwise explain you're seeing similar behavior.
[16:25:53] <sammych> test*
[16:26:06] <Lencl> is there a pager in jquery that will not slow down the page if there's 5,000 items?
[16:26:22] <robertmaxrees> sammych the current gist doesn't make it clear at all that you're having the same issu elesehwere, so make sure you clarify that.
[16:26:26] <robertmaxrees> Lencl "pager"?
[16:27:06] <Lencl> robertmaxrees, basically.. a method of putting 10 elements at a time while hiding the other 4,990
[16:27:12] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:27:28] <sammych> yeah, paging, like a table
[16:27:28] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of content on a given page.
[16:27:34] <robertmaxrees> ajax, yo.
[16:27:35] <Lencl> but even if I do display:none in all except 10 of them.. the page slows down
[16:27:43] <sammych> the solution is to use server delivered content
[16:27:49] <Lencl> ah ok so ajax the best for this
[16:27:57] <robertmaxrees> or server-side paging.
[16:28:12] <robertmaxrees> buit storing that much in the document at once is going to present you some uniquye challenges.
[16:28:21] <robertmaxrees> you could store JSON and only render the 10 things you want at a time.
[16:28:52] <sammych> can you use a plugin like datatables?
[16:29:06] <sammych> or any decent *Table plugin?
[16:30:15] <Lencl> never used it
[16:30:30] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> something tells me they don't have tabular data.
[16:31:14] <sammych> use angular ;)
[16:31:21] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[16:31:27] <robertmaxrees> solve the problem, don't create more :)
[16:33:23] <sammych> for mostly static apps, stick with jQ, but I'll be damned if I don't use a MV* framework for a webapp
[16:33:39] <robertmaxrees> yuck.
[16:33:54] <robertmaxrees> if you HAVE to, stick with backbone.  otherwise, react.
[16:34:31] <sammych> angular2.
[16:34:40] <robertmaxrees> i don't live MV* period.
[16:35:01] <robertmaxrees> *like
[16:35:11] <sammych> any particular reason?
[16:35:27] <robertmaxrees> i prefer a more functional approach
[16:36:03] <robertmaxrees> MV* is great for classical languages - javascript isn't really a classical language (even in ES6), so it always feels awkward.
[16:36:34] <sammych> define: 'classical'
[16:36:40] <robertmaxrees> classical inheritance
[16:41:15] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok so it looks like <script type="text/css" src=""></script>
[16:41:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:41:23] <Es0teric> is not loading
[16:41:27] <robertmaxrees> right...
[16:41:39] <robertmaxrees> text/css isn't a script.
[16:42:02] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i mean <style
[16:42:14] <robertmaxrees> it should load fine.
[16:42:31] <robertmaxrees> doubleclick might not allow you to do that fwiw.
[16:42:31] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees it doesnt
[16:42:49] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees so what would be an alternate way of doing it?
[16:43:01] <robertmaxrees> if google doesn't let you, you don't.

[16:43:48] <robertmaxrees> you need to make sure you play by their rules.
[17:04:15] <skinux> How do I submit a form?
[17:04:20] <robertmaxrees> .submit()\
[17:26:40] <ilhami> form.submit skinux :P
[17:26:51] <robertmaxrees> that's a method btw.
[17:26:56] <ilhami> yeah :P
[17:26:56] <skinux> Yeah, I got it working.
[17:31:09] <ilhami> what should I use for message dialog? Like an OK / cancel dialog?
[17:56:56] <skinux> Is this right for setting a form element value? $('#select_category#category').value = cat;
[17:58:47] <sammych> skinux: .value is for vanilla JS. if you're referencing a jQuery object, use .val(newVal)
[17:58:57] <sammych> vanilla JS element*
[17:59:30] <sammych> you can get at the HTMLElement by using array notation $(selector)[0]
[18:01:13] <skinux> It's still not changing the value
[18:51:29] <jqueryius> hi
[18:51:47] <jqueryius> I am using jquery 'load()' to load my header.html file
[18:52:00] <jqueryius> because the header will be the same on all pages, i figure I could just put it in one file and include that
[18:52:12] <jqueryius> So I use $("#header").load("header.html");
[18:52:22] <jqueryius> But I am finding the hover effects on the header no longer work
[18:52:28] <jqueryius> what reason could this be?
[18:55:08] <Es0teric> anybody still here?
[18:55:51] <jqueryius> I have to head off for a bit, but if anyone knows the answer please let me know or reply at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30519859/jquery-load-causing-effects-to-stop-working if you use SO
[18:55:55] <jqueryius> thanks
[20:45:18] <GeekDude> Which should I use, .find('a').attr('href') or .find('a')[0].href ? I know it's kind of a subjective question, but I still want an answer
[20:47:52] <GeekDude> I would assume the only real difference is a stylistic choice, and being in #jquery that would mean the second one
[20:48:40] <rcyr> GeekDude: Forget that attributes exist :)
[20:48:50] <rcyr> You pretty much never need .attr
[20:48:54] <rcyr> Use properties (.prop)
[20:49:48] <GeekDude> I'm not sure what the difference is
[20:50:09] <GeekDude> prop appears to do some normalization stuff that really isn't needed for href, but I guess could be nice
[20:50:41] <rcyr> GeekDude: "prop" accesses the actual node fields.
[20:50:47] <shoky> actually for "href" you want .attr many times since that gets you exactly what was put into the href attribute. prop is the runtime value which can be different
[20:50:48] <GeekDude> so you would recommend .find('a').prop('href')?
[20:51:24] <rcyr> GeekDude: Depends... like shoky said, "sometimes" for href, you want the actual value and not the "expanded one"
[20:51:26] <GeekDude> shoky: If the runtime value was different wouldn't I indeed want the runtime value to be that?
[20:51:45] <shoky> GeekDude: depends what you're looking for
[20:51:57] <GeekDude> Also, in another spot I'm doing $("<a>[Open]</a>").attr("href", "ahk:" + e.href)
[20:52:07] <GeekDude> would .prop be appropriate for that as well?
[20:52:10] <rcyr> GeekDude: Example <a href="#lol">a</a>   .attr('href') would return #lol and .prop('href') would return http://www.whatever.com/path#lol"
[20:52:42] <shoky> for "href" just use .attr i think. usually that's what people want
[20:52:43] <GeekDude> The expanded one is preferable in my case. However, it's already expanded in the source
[20:52:45] <rcyr> But.. that's pretty much the only time you might actually need .attr('href')
[20:56:01] <GeekDude> Well then, would you recommend `$("<a>[Open]</a>").prop("href", "ahk:" + $(e).prop("href"))` more so than `$("<a>[Open]</a>").prop("href", "ahk:" + e.href)`?
[20:56:26] <shoky> $(e).prop('href')  is just e.href
[20:56:32] <shoky> so no reason to wrap jquery
[20:57:32] <GeekDude> if ".prop('href')
[20:57:48] <GeekDude> if ".prop('href')" on a jquery object is just the same as .href on a normal element
[20:57:57] <GeekDude> Then why don't I just do .find('a')[0].href
[20:58:05] <GeekDude> it's shorter than .find('a').prop('href')
[20:58:16] <rcyr> GeekDude: If you want to unwrap the node, sure
[20:58:27] <shoky> you can do that too. it's less readable and hardly shorter tho ;p
[21:00:09] <Shebbi> .find('a').prop('href') <-- more readable for me
[21:04:05] <GeekDude> .prop doesn't seem to let me set the inline style attribute
[21:04:31] <rcyr> Can't you use .css
[21:04:34] <rcyr> ?
[21:04:48] <GeekDude> I'm trying to copy the css from another element
[21:04:59] <GeekDude> I'm writing a greasemonkey extension, trying to make my element blend in
[21:05:09] <shoky> the .style property isn't a string like the style attr
[21:05:14] <rcyr> Then take the attribute
[21:20:21] <john2x> x-post from #javascript. why aren't request headers readily available in an jqXHR object?
[21:22:52] <rcyr> Wouldn't that be stupid? If you set them then you know what they are :)
[21:24:18] <rcyr> For the response headers, you can access them on the jqXHR object with getAllResponseHeaders or getResponseHeader
[21:24:28] <rcyr> john2x: ^
[21:33:12] <john2x> rcyr: ah I'm thinking in terms of debugging methods.. but yeah, i'm just logging them as they are set at the moment. was wondering if there was a better way.
[23:52:47] <arup_r> I am looking for a way to replace the form if it exist, otherwise add..
[23:52:55] <arup_r> https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/839d9206f71233571e6c#file-ask-html-L2
[23:53:02] <arup_r> What is the way to do?
[23:53:24] <arup_r> I need Jquery function names
[23:58:10] <markholmes> you just want to check if the form with the id #post_form exists?
[23:59:37] <arup_r> yes.. if exists replace it with a new form... or simply add it as the first child of the <div>
