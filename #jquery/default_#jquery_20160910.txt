[00:59:20] <jonez> greetings. I am getting a "type error" on my console while using 3.1.0. the specific error is "a.indexOf is not a function". any help is appreciated :)
[00:59:39] <jonez> I was previously using 1.12-ish
[01:03:57] <jonez> never mind.. backed down to a recent 1.12 version, no errors.

[10:43:08] <monkeyKat> hello
[10:57:17] <aro> does anyone know of a good plugin to animate out an element on ajax load?
[10:57:27] <aro> i cant seem to find anything for a single element in a page
[11:27:45] <aro> is there a way to pass a parameter to a function, which makes a step in that function complete ONLY when an ajax call has finished?
[11:27:57] <aro> like function a - initiate ajax request
[11:28:01] <aro> immediately execute function b
[11:28:16] <aro> then function b holds until the ajax request has completed
[11:28:18] <aro> is that possible?
[11:55:49] <floown> Hello
[11:56:20] <floown> I have a little prob with jquery in a Drupal 7 : http://pastebin.com/xWhUtbWX
[11:56:39] <floown> The "abeille" doesn't display
[11:57:25] <floown> on page loading
[12:12:19] <z1haze> anyone use nvd3 charts? I am trying to figure out how to replace the data for a chart
[12:46:08] <ajpiano> floown: abeille display is not an attribute, it's a css class
[12:46:17] <ajpiano> name
[13:26:44] <floown> sorry, I have modify the code and I have that now : https://jsfiddle.net/pew3tfnh/5/
[13:26:53] <floown> ajpiano:
[13:27:15] <floown>  $(".abeille").show(); does not apply
[13:29:26] <floown> and I wanted that the show apply only for : @media (min-width: 740px)
[13:30:30] <ajpiano> floown don't use show and hide, use add/removeClass
[13:30:34] <ajpiano> then it'll work with your media queries
[13:30:46] <ajpiano> in this case, i don't think the events are happening in the order you expect
[13:31:00] <ajpiano> but if you use classes you should be able to do it all in css anyway
[15:49:10] <\monster\> Hey guys, is it possible to somehow extand jquery into a custom object so that this would be compatible:  $('#boo').append(new CustomObj());   ?
[15:52:51] <johnnycadelco> hi guys
[15:53:24] <johnnycadelco> got a question need a bit of help
[15:53:29] <johnnycadelco> here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/2tL973c0/
[15:54:00] <johnnycadelco> my goal is simply to search spotify's API and populate the results in a <div> there
[15:54:28] <johnnycadelco> that's pretty much it
[15:57:01] <johnnycadelco> my question is how I can how i populate that data here? when they press the search button depending the query
[15:57:05] <\monster\> ah think i figured it out, you just return from the constructor
[15:58:20] <johnnycadelco> here's an example of one that works.. but I think it's a bit complex
[15:58:37] <johnnycadelco> and it uses ajax.. which is fine: http://jsfiddle.net/JMPerez/0u0v7e1b/
[15:59:14] <johnnycadelco> but for the first fiddle should be simpler.. that second example i don't get
[17:11:38] <RottenCore> anyone home today?

[19:45:50] <adamsilver> "Extending $.fn.embed.settings.sources allows you to use other proprietary embeds." how can I extend in jQuery? This is overwriting the entire array: $.extend($.fn.embed.settings.sources, {youtube: {name: 'xxx'}});
[21:19:50] <aro> how do i animate an object to move to the left without making it absolutely positioned..?
[21:32:31] <aro> i tried using margin-left, but it leave the right most edge in place still
