[03:36:08] <T0nttu> any insight on this, guys: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/triggering-other-events-with-accordion-open-close
[03:37:47] <sunbeam> hi, some site of me was infected with bad code, every Javascript file has this code,
[03:37:51] <sunbeam> what can i do best to remove this?
[04:04:28] <FrameFever> I want to splice an array where the length is bigger then the array length
[04:04:39] <sjeijk> hi I know its OT, but can any1 recommend website backup software?
[04:04:39] <FrameFever> like in PHP
[04:05:03] <FrameFever> is there some jquery helper function for that?
[04:19:19] <hobote_> sunbeam: hard of grep?
[04:19:22] <hobote_> heard*
[04:19:29] <hobote_> :D
[04:19:54] <hobote_> I honestly wouldnt trust it a quick search and replace though, better to reinstall the files from a known good source

[05:19:25] <abcdef> Hi! I'm using blueimp file uploader. Can I select the uploaded files via JavaScript?
[05:22:12] <Noeble> question: I declare a global variable in my main document. Then I load dynamic content that I append in a container. I want this dynamic content to be able to set a value to the variable I declared earlier
[05:22:17] <Noeble> is this posible?
[05:25:59] <brass> Noeble, sure.
[05:26:37] <brass> abcdef, that is interesting you say this. What do you mean select? You have the name of the file path name yes
[05:26:59] <brass> as i told you in your email
[05:27:40] <Noeble> brass: how? =) I tried but they values dont seem to update
[05:28:29] <brass> Noeble, var = othervariable;   ?
[05:29:26] <Noeble> brass, tried. Does not work..
[05:29:27] <brass> Noeble: you are loading dynamic content. Asynchonous call? success: function(response){ var = response.var }
[05:29:29] <abcdef> yes, i'd like the name of the files
[05:30:30] <Noeble> brass: yes, using ajax to load
[05:30:53] <brass> abcdef, I don't have the blueimp code handy, but you will need to locate the code that selects the files. You are already selecting the files (note: the files aren't at all uploaded to the server at this point)
[05:31:18] <Noeble> brass: I load a whole document including html and everything that I append
[05:32:13] <brass> Noeble: and you want to this string to the global variable right? Have you tried setting the variable? What does your code look like. you can PM me if you like
[05:34:43] <abcdef> brass: I'm using auto uploading. therefore they are already at the server. but when I submit the form, the files Variable is empty
[05:36:52] <brass> abcdef: with auto upload it must reset the files variable?
[05:50:34] <scarlet_razor> how to get li id value ?
[05:50:35] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/wTE7F/
[05:51:27] <scarlet_razor> anyone please spare a moment ?
[05:57:31] <shoky> scarlet_razor: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/wTE7F/1/
[05:57:59] <shoky> also.. <li> shouldn't be a child of <div> ;p
[06:13:49] <abcdef> brass: seems that auto upload resets the files variable. it would be nice if it is not beeing reset or if i can read the filenames from anywhere else
[06:19:08] <scarlet_razor> shoky:  so much thanks.... :)

[07:01:38] <Gestahlt> i have a accordion that can drag and dro
[07:01:39] <Gestahlt> drop
[07:01:41] <Gestahlt> 2 accordions
[07:01:49] <Gestahlt> and i can drop stuff into the content
[07:01:55] <Gestahlt> from an expanded item
[07:01:58] <Gestahlt> should not happen
[07:02:02] <Gestahlt> how can i prevent that?
[07:04:23] <patie> help - i have anonymouse function in ajax call http://pastebin.com/vQUZ4r6W .. but return dont work.. is there way to return something in this case ?? thanks
[07:05:28] <alexr2> patie, Ajax calls are asynchronous, you aren't returning to anything.
[07:05:48] <patie> alexr2: aha :/
[07:06:05] <alexr2> Look into writing callbacks
[07:09:01] <scarlet_razor> why my fadeout not work, http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/wTE7F/2/
[07:09:17] <patie> alexr2: what callback you mean ? complete is also callback imo
[07:09:39] <alexr2> scarlet_razor, $(this) != title
[07:10:12] <alexr2> It is a callback, but i'm assuming you want your delete function to return something?
[07:11:30] <scarlet_razor> alexr2: so sorry.... any guide how select it ?
[07:12:13] <alexr2> scarlet_razor, just do title.fadeOut() instead of $(this).fadeOut()
[07:16:53] <scarlet_razor> alexr2: unfortunately it remove all http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/wTE7F/4/
[07:17:44] <alexr2> scarlet_razor, well what are you trying to do?  $("#feed div") captures ALL divs inside of <div id="feed">
[07:17:52] <patie> alexr2: yes i want return something after successful removing item from server
[07:18:57] <scarlet_razor> if found spesific id (in this case 44) it will remove the <div id =  44>
[07:19:22] <scarlet_razor> is there any misuse in my script logic alexr2
[07:19:23] <alexr2> scarlet_razor, use ?each
[07:19:24] <bot-t> scarlet_razor, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[07:19:42] <alexr2> you have to loop over each div for that to work
[07:19:44] <scarlet_razor> oh.. thanks... i take that one...
[07:19:49] <alexr2> that's when you can use $(this)
[07:21:07] <alexr2> patie, take a look at this and see if you can make something like that work with your code: http://jsfiddle.net/XMtRx/
[07:21:40] <patie> alexr2: aaaaaaa this way, imho it will be work thank you
[07:22:56] <alexr2> patie, you can put the callback right in the ajax as well, but it's not going to be able to do a "return" or anything.  You need to use another function to process it individually
[07:23:21] <patie> alexr2: no problem, thanks
[07:24:42] <cawa> hi can some one help me with twitter bootstrap modal
[07:25:04] <alexr2> cawa, easier to ask your question directly rather than asking to ask a question

[07:41:58] <crab> hi.
[07:44:38] <Jerbot> what's up?
[07:45:01] <Jerbot> Aw man, I'm having a really rough time with this code.
[07:46:02] <Jerbot> crab, you able to field any q's?
[07:46:21] <alexr2> Jerbot, post your question, someone will answer it if they can
[07:46:59] <Jerbot> I'm just trying to get some php into my jquery....
[07:47:38] <alexr2> That's not a question :-)
[07:47:46] <Jerbot> I have an input field that asks for a title
[07:48:49] <Jerbot> and when the complete name of a title is typed in, I'd like to execute an sql statement SELECT content FROM rack WHERE title = val
[07:48:56] <Jerbot> see what I mean, basically?
[07:49:06] <alexr2> Following so far
[07:49:30] <Jerbot> So I wrote some PHP that hits the database and pulls out the right stuff, but I still need to pass in a variable on-select.
[07:49:43] <Jerbot> the variable should contain the val, right?
[07:50:01] <Jerbot> someone told me that it was possible, to write a php wrapper, I think he called it.
[07:50:05] <alexr2> An input field or a select dropdown?
[07:50:07] <Jerbot> and to use ajax
[07:50:15] <Jerbot> I'm sorry 'on keyup'
[07:50:40] <alexr2> So bind the keyup event to the input.  Get the value of the keyup, use an ajax call to send the value to the server
[07:50:59] <rode> hey :)
[07:51:10] <rode> can someone help me on this plugin http://keith-wood.name/countdownRef.html#format
[07:51:10] <rode> ?
[07:51:12] <alexr2> rather get the value of the input
[07:51:39] <rode> i have Y-m-d H:m:s date format on mysql and php, and i can't understand how to format to use that plugin
[07:51:50] <Jerbot> right get the value of the input after keyup and send the value to the server asap, --
[07:52:05] <Jerbot> You know exactly what I mean, I think.  I actually made a video, but it's purely htlm.
[07:52:06] <Jerbot> html*
[07:53:04] <alexr2> So where is the problem coming in?
[07:53:24] <Jerbot> not knowing how to do that. XD
[07:53:33] <alexr2> Which part?  Any of that?
[07:53:34] <Jerbot> pass the variable in
[07:53:42] <Jerbot> 'to the server via an ajax call'
[07:53:53] <alexr2> You're okay with binding events though, correct?
[07:53:59] <crab> if i have a bunch of HTML as a string (returned in response to a .get() or .post()), how do i extract all, say, <script> elements from it? just do $(responseText) and loop over the resulting array?
[07:54:01] <alexr2> ?ajax @ Jerbot
[07:54:02] <bot-t> Jerbot, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:54:46] <prometh> hi
[07:55:54] <prometh> let's say i have $("input[type=text]") and it returns multiple elements.... how might i best narrow through that list to find [name=something] ?
[07:55:58] <prometh> just use find() ?
[07:56:03] <crab> yes.
[07:56:11] <prometh> or is there a faster way using eq() and index() ?
[07:57:21] <prometh> ..
[07:58:41] <crab> i guess you could use .filter(function ...), but i doubt it would be worth it.
[07:58:52] <crab> benchmark and see if it really matters.
[07:59:05] <Jerbot> $(document).ready(function() { $("#input").keyup(function() { var val = $("#input").val(); .alert("<?php echo $val } shouldn't work, right?
[07:59:15] <crab> sorry, let me rephrase. if it really matters, benchmark both and see which is faster.
[07:59:39] <Jerbot> Because $val in php doesn't equal val in js?
[07:59:53] <prometh> filter(), cool, thanks.. i didn't knowabout that
[08:00:03] <prometh> oh, it requires a function
[08:00:18] <prometh> ah, takes a selector :)
[08:01:05] <Jerbot> i think it definitely requires ajax.
[08:01:40] <alexr2> Jerbot, you need to send it to your server using ajax

[09:59:13] <scarlet_razor> hello anyone.... ??
[10:09:53] <wiremaster> hey there
[10:10:39] <wiremaster> I can call anonymous functions assigned to a variable with var_1();
[10:10:49] <X-warrior> Is there an option to resume Vegas background plugin? So I can resume a paused slideshow?
[10:11:08] <wiremaster> var_1 = function(){return "hello there";} var_1(); //says hello there in the console
[10:11:47] <scarlet_razor> bad time...
[10:12:10] <wiremaster> but immediately after that, if I assign a property to var_1, it only returns the function
[10:12:12] <wiremaster> why is that
[10:12:48] <wiremaster> ar_1 = function(){return "hello there";} var_1(); var_1.someproperty = "something else"; // the first var_1() no longer works
[10:13:41] <alexr2> wiremaster, var_1.someproperty turns var_1 into an object, not a function
[10:13:52] <alexr2> so the original function gets overwritten
[10:14:05] <wiremaster> does javascript wait until end of execution to return things?
[10:14:12] <alexr2> it's the equivalent of doing var_1 = function...; var_1 = {}; var_1.someprop = "test"
[10:14:25] <wiremaster> I thought it spits out anything it sees the moment it sees it
[10:15:05] <wiremaster> when I first say var_1(), it is supposed to execute that lambda, *then* overwrite it into an object, right?
[10:16:24] <alexr2> it executes as you go... if you do var abc = function(){}; abc() <-- it executes here; then you do abc.test = "test"... now abc() will now longer work
[10:16:59] <wiremaster> yep, that is my question: abc() is not working, by virtue of code written *after* the fact
[10:17:40] <wiremaster> it is not showing "hello there" in firebug, not unless I do console.log(var_1())
[10:18:57] <alexr2> ?demo @ wiremaster
[10:19:00] <bot-t> wiremaster, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:20:37] <scarlet_razor> sorry alexr2 for bothering can u spare a moment to check my script http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/wTE7F/11/
[10:21:12] <alexr2> scarlet_razor, put a variable in there with what data would be returning please so I can see what I'm workign with
[10:23:20] <wiremaster> alexr2, for some reason this outputs "wire master" on my Firebug but nothing on JsLint? http://jsfiddle.net/2q3Vx/
[10:23:30] <crankharder> exit
[10:23:30] <wiremaster> uhm, JsFiddle, sorry
[10:23:44] <scarlet_razor> alexr2: http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/wTE7F/15/
[10:24:07] <alexr2> wiremaster, what were you expecting it to output?
[10:24:21] <wiremaster> "wire master", of course... just like on Firebug...
[10:24:48] <alexr2> you're not printing it out anywhere on jsfiddle
[10:24:55] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net/2q3Vx/1/
[10:25:38] <alexr2> scarlet_razor, you never showed me what data is... ?
[10:27:19] <gnarf> alexr2: earlier, .children().last().remove() is probably a little better than suggesting the use of :last :)
[10:27:44] <wiremaster> well hmm, firebug shows output without any need for document.write()
[10:27:50] <alexr2> yeah?  does .children(":last") not work?
[10:27:56] <wiremaster> so I cannot simulate what I am seeing with jsfiddle
[10:28:13] <gnarf> alexr2: it works, but those non-standard positional selectors just aren't great
[10:28:17] <alexr2> ahh
[10:28:18] <alexr2> okay
[10:28:40] <gnarf> alexr2: I usually try to only use real CSS selectors, but it's probably just a preference
[10:29:17] <wiremaster> essentially, the first code I linked to, outputs "wire master" on firebug
[10:29:27] <wiremaster> but this code: http://jsfiddle.net/euRzK/ only outputs "hey there";
[10:29:44] <wiremaster> when I actually expect it to output "wire master hey there"
[10:30:09] <alexr2> works fine here... http://jsfiddle.net/euRzK/1/
[10:30:24] <alexr2> remember debuggers aren't perfect
[10:31:04] <wiremaster> because I made var_1 into an object *after* running the lambda
[10:31:23] <wiremaster> ah, okay... I'll chalk this up to a Firebug peculiarity
[10:31:53] <wiremaster> yes, as long as you use something to output explicitly, it works fine
[10:32:06] <wiremaster> only when I rely on the debugger to do the outputting, do I see issues
[10:32:37] <alexr2> wiremaster, it's generally an output buffer issue.  By the time it's written out, the buffer is overwritten
[10:32:41] <alexr2> Or something of that sort
[10:32:53] <alexr2> I'm not too great with that stuff, but that's what was told to me once
[10:32:59] <wiremaster> there's an output buffer involved here? that explains... everything lol
[10:33:16] <alexr2> Javascript executes a lot faster than firebug can work its magic :-)
[10:33:19] <wiremaster> so Firebug is not a 'pure js just spit out what you see'
[10:33:26] <gabrieluk> hello there. I'm using jquery and 2 jquery plugins. fittext.js, to make the text "responsive" and sticky.js, to make a certain div display: fixed. Everything works, expect when i use fittext inside a sticky.js div. question: is that compatibility problem? using 1 script inside another usually will give me headache?
[10:33:42] <wiremaster> thanks alexr2, this would have surely kept me up at night
[10:33:49] <alexr2> No worries
[10:35:40] <wiremaster> so functions cannot have properties... this being JS I assumed anything was possible ;)
[10:36:12] <wiremaster> holy mind bending batman
[10:36:16] <wiremaster> it IS possible!
[10:36:30] <alexr2> Is it?
[10:36:34] <wiremaster> functions can still have their own properties...
[10:36:58] <alexr2> Weird... that just seems wrong!
[10:37:16] <hallas> .. ?
[10:37:18] <hallas> jk?
[10:37:20] <Lucky--> im a little confused with jquery's .deferred. I've read the documentation which is crap at explaining things. so i would create the object, setup my .done callbacks and call it with .resolve which is the function that kicks it off?
[10:37:26] <wiremaster> check it out alexr2 http://jsfiddle.net/PfdMt/
[10:37:57] <alexr2> I don't like it :-P
[10:38:02] <wiremaster> :D
[10:42:41] <wiremaster> I just wonder how much more there is to discover in this weird and wonderful rabbit hole
[10:44:37] <tw2113> i'd dare say wiremaster has only dipped 1 toe in so far
[10:44:51] <wiremaster> haha! yes
[10:45:11] <gnarf> alexr2: What do you think jQuery.each or any of those other methods are - jQuery is a function :)
[10:45:17] <wiremaster> I was always afraid of JS... only touching enough to get my sliders or photo galleries working
[10:45:32] <wiremaster> now I'm taking this head on, and 3 hrs in I discover this
[10:45:35] <alexr2> Meh... I don't like it anyways!
[10:45:59] <wiremaster> gnarf, well... whoah, okay
[10:47:23] <gabrieluk> man, this moments i see how important is to know js before jquery. codecademy.com is a good place to learn js
[10:47:35] <gnarf> ?101
[10:47:36] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[10:47:43] <gnarf> ^^^ one of the best JS books I've ever read
[10:47:44] <z3yo> Hi there
[10:47:53] <wiremaster> no, please don't tempt me with more books :)
[10:48:03] <wiremaster> I got a solid recommendation to read the big green rhino
[10:48:07] <wiremaster> then 'the good parts'
[10:48:14] <gabrieluk> wiremaster, the link i sent is not a book, it is interactive
[10:48:39] <gabrieluk> eloquent, is also interactive, not at the same level
[10:49:22] <wiremaster> and I'm just skimming around stackoverflow, demystifying things that scared me the most: weird variables that could contain entire functions...
[10:49:39] <wiremaster> now I know some cool words like 'lambda' and 'closure' and stuff :P
[10:50:25] <dabear> anyone here tried typescript yet?
[10:51:15] <z3yo> When I do "$container.append($proto.replace(/\$\$name\$\$/g, index++));" I have a Reference Error : require is not defined
[10:51:31] <z3yo> But I can't find a "require" in my code
[10:53:04] <z3yo> Any idea … ?
[10:54:08] <dabear> what's $proto?
[10:54:11] <wiremaster> I couldn't find a 'require' anywhere in jquery source either
[10:54:17] <wiremaster> maybe a plugin...
[10:54:25] <dabear> ?demo @ z3yo
[10:54:26] <bot-t> z3yo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:02:11] <Lucky--> require is require.js an asyncronous module loader
[11:04:43] <Lucky--> dabear: yes
[11:05:08] <Lucky--> dabear: typescript is great in concept, horrible in implementation, its a pita because it wants you to code one way or the other
[11:05:26] <Lucky--> and it gets confusing
[11:06:33] <wiremaster> "Client-side JavaScript does not exhibit the nonlinear cross-reference problem nearly to
[11:06:33] <wiremaster> the extent that the core language does"
[11:06:44] <wiremaster> what... is nonlinear cross-reference?
[11:08:19] <wiremaster> np if it is not possible to answer without context, I found that in 'definitive guide'
[11:08:38] <wiremaster> context would mean pasting the whole previous paragraph here, probably
[11:15:49] <lampe2> hey i got a question i got a html where i include all my js files and iam uesing in a main.js file jquery ui methods but they dont work. if i put them into the html directly it works can someone help pls ?
[11:16:26] <wiremaster> lampe2, did you include main.js after jquery.js?
[11:16:54] <lampe2> wiremaster, yes
[11:18:05] <lampe2> oh i found the error :)
[11:19:27] <shoky> wiremaster: he explains that on pg. 3 , he's talking about cross-references in the book and in learning material for new programming languages
[11:19:55] <wiremaster> oh, okay, that...
[11:20:06] <wiremaster> thanks shoky =)
[11:24:12] <scarlet_razor> alexr2: sorry i dont have any idea how to include json data in there http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/wTE7F/17/
[11:24:30] <alexr2> scarlet_razor, you're getting some kind of data back from the server, just paste that data in there
[11:24:32] <scarlet_razor> is there something wrong with my ileterate
[11:26:00] <star_prone> Hi
[11:26:13] <scarlet_razor> if u mean the this['id'] it just a record form tabel id
[11:26:38] <star_prone> how can i avoid doing something like this: $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().siblings("#my-id")?
[11:26:55] <tone> can i not .append("html") to a div?
[11:26:59] <alexr2> star_prone, $(this).closest("#my-id")
[11:27:11] <alexr2> but with ids, you don't need to do $(this)... you can just do $("#my-id")
[11:27:21] <tw2113> so you want the string "html" to be at the end of some div tone?
[11:27:56] <tone> <div id="container"></div>, i want to be able to insert html into the inside of #container on the fly
[11:28:06] <scarlet_razor> alexr2: as i know and analyze i guess it just somekind a looping problem... can u help me to check it
[11:28:17] <tone> but when I $("#container").append("value"); i don't see it
[11:28:29] <tw2113> $('#container').append('<p>html</p>');
[11:28:31] <scarlet_razor> is there somekind of mistake i create in jquery looping
[11:28:36] <cusco> $(#container).innerHTML = "<a href='xpto.html'>click-me</a>";
[11:28:42] <alexr2> scarlet_razor, when you do the ajax request, you get some sort of data back.  you put that data in an $.each loop.  that will loop over an array of "data".  the this, at that point, refers to the current item it's on
[11:28:45] <cusco> or append
[11:29:47] <tone> oh duh, i was missing the # that's why it wasn't appending
[11:29:48] <wiremaster> thanks everyone for being so friendly and receptive of questions
[11:29:55] <scarlet_razor> alexr2: the json result you mean ?
[11:29:56] <tone> i seriously do that 3 times a day
[11:30:03] <tone> thank you tw2113 and cusco
[11:30:06] <wiremaster> I will come back later, gotta get some work done now...
[11:30:07] <alexr2> yes
[11:30:09] <wiremaster> bye!
[11:30:31] <star_prone> alexr2: thanks
[11:30:39] <alexr2> no problem
[11:30:58] <alexr2> gotta go for a bit, scarlet_razor, there are plenty of people here that can help you
[11:31:35] <star_prone> can I animate the change of class?
[11:31:35] <scarlet_razor> thanks... for u attention at least :)
[11:33:37] <scarlet_razor> anyone.... can someone give some advice...
[11:33:42] <dabear> yes
[11:33:46] <dabear> go take a break
[11:33:50] <dabear> good advice
[11:33:56] <scarlet_razor> :)
[11:34:12] <scarlet_razor> good advice.. u know... im still curious
[11:34:21] <scarlet_razor> why myscript not going well
[11:34:45] <scarlet_razor> dabear: my be u can help me so i can Rest In Peace... :D
[11:35:06] <dabear> myscript?
[11:35:19] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/wTE7F/17/
[11:35:37] <Cronoh> scarlet dont u use some kind of javascript debugger
[11:35:37] <scarlet_razor> i think i got some ileterate or looping mistake
[11:35:45] <scarlet_razor> firebug
[11:35:47] <scarlet_razor> yes...
[11:35:50] <Cronoh> so why dont u debug ?
[11:35:55] <Cronoh> you need to learn to debug your own code
[11:35:59] <scarlet_razor> nothing saying by firebug
[11:36:04] <scarlet_razor> the json work fine
[11:36:10] <scarlet_razor> it just literation problem....
[11:36:15] <scarlet_razor> i think...
[11:36:29] <Cronoh> remove the iteration code, change it to just an alert or something
[11:36:33] <Cronoh> to help you debug values
[11:36:47] <scarlet_razor> i already doing it....
[11:37:00] <Cronoh> ....
[11:37:11] <scarlet_razor> i just need someone who has knowledge or experience in jquery to help me.. is there any other possiblility...
[11:37:17] <Cronoh> hahaha
[11:37:41] <Cronoh> you will ALWAYS need someone with experience to fix your code if you do not learn how to debug yourself
[11:37:45] <Cronoh> your code is very simple to debug...
[11:38:30] <scarlet_razor> u know.. i attempt to fix it in about 5 hours... by doing alone...
[11:38:39] <Cronoh> hold on i will show u code to debug..
[11:44:10] <hallas> turkish programmers...
[11:44:24] <hallas> really should take a step back and learn to do things properly
[11:45:36] <Cronoh> ok
[11:45:42] <Cronoh> scarlet are u there
[11:45:52] <scarlet_razor> yeah...
[11:46:04] <Cronoh> this is what i mean on how u should try simple debug to your code
[11:46:06] <Cronoh> http://jsfiddle.net/wTE7F/18/
[11:47:29] <scarlet_razor> Cronoh:  thanks i try it on my server... :)
[11:47:52] <Cronoh> you should find out when u look at that if u see values is undefined or something, then you know something is wrong
[12:00:03] <Sonderblade> any way in jquery to get selected text?
[12:00:31] <hallas> Sonderblade nope
[12:02:25] <Sonderblade> window.getSelection and document.selection seem to work, but i also need an event to fire when the selection is changed
[12:22:23] <scarlet_razor> Cronoh: i found your debuging code help but making me more confuse...
[12:27:50] <fusion271> You guys does this eventually crash your browser if you keep clicking reassign? http://caseywise.com/?p=2242
[12:28:06] <fusion271> I can't figure out why or how to debug this one… :|
[12:57:35] <PhonicUK> is there an event I can trap that fires when a element first appears on the page?
[12:57:58] <PhonicUK> more specifically, when its container has overflow:auto, and the element moves up such that it's visible within its parent
[13:01:44] <foofoobar> Hi, is it possible to re-run bindings? Because I'm using a script which shows an overlay by getting some content of my div with $('#mydiv').html() and .appends() it into the overlay
[13:01:53] <foofoobar> But with this method, binding or selectors does not work anymore
[13:02:33] <foofoobar> e.g. $('.myclass').click() works fine on #mydiv. But when I get the source of #mydiv and .append it into another div, the $('.foo').click() is not called when I click it
[13:03:11] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @foofoobar
[13:03:11] <bot-t> foofoobar, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:03:23] <foofoobar> ryanneufeld: It's more a general question
[13:04:13] <ryanneufeld> foofoobar: you can use ?on
[13:04:13] <bot-t> foofoobar, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:04:38] <ryanneufeld> foofoobar: though I'm not clear what you're asking, I think that will help
[13:04:53] <foofoobar> all right, if it does not work I will try to build an example
[13:04:54] <foofoobar> thanks
[13:06:09] <Imaginativeone> is there a resource for working with jQuery ONLY on IE8?
[13:06:52] <foofoobar> ryanneufeld: look's like you guessed right, it works
[13:07:12] <ryanneufeld> foofoobar: guessing wasn't a factor :P
[13:07:22] <ryanneufeld> Imaginativeone: wat?
[13:08:27] <foofoobar> hehe
[13:08:49] <danheberden> Imaginativeone: yeah, it's api.jquery.com
[13:09:59] <ryanneufeld> Imaginativeone: I forgot my mind reading hat at work, you'll have to be more specific in your question.
[13:20:21] <WebDragon> I was pretty sure I understood how .on() worked, for adding control to elements that get added to the DOM after the document.ready, but apparently I'm DoingItWrong™ : http://msc.client-proof.com/floorplans.php when you click the images loaded from picasa, I expect to be able to trigger a fancybox event, only I can't even get it to alert() let alone preventDefault() ... where did I screw it up?
[13:21:20] <WebDragon> hopefully someone's around that can help; I'm stumped... I don't even get error msgs in the console
[13:24:08] <ravenzz> WebDragon did you read the doc?
[13:24:38] <WebDragon> for .on() ? yeah
[13:25:03] <WebDragon> I evidently missed something, and having a thinko in progress, I evidently missed something
[13:25:16] <WebDragon> department of redundancy department, here
[13:25:17] <WebDragon> heh
[13:25:20] <WebDragon> whups :)
[13:25:39] <ravenzz> read it again http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:25:52] <WebDragon> can you tell I've not had enough coffee to code properly? can't even think straight (plus got that hurricane coming in too, tomorrow)
[13:26:19] <WebDragon> ok; sometimes just asking the question out loud is sufficient to solve the problem :)
[13:26:26] <WebDragon> we'll see...
[13:26:30] <CodesStuff> Anyone here use Instagram at all?
[13:26:32] <ravenzz> the answer is there
[13:26:48] <ravenzz> I don't, I think it is lame
[13:26:54] <CodesStuff> Likewise.
[13:26:55] <foofoobar> <ul><li><a href=#>foo</a><div class='selector'>bar</div></li><li>…</li></ul> I have an .on("click",..) on the 'ul li a'. How to get from this to the .selector? next() gives me the .selector element of the next <li>
[13:28:52] <ravenzz> foofoobar I think you are looking for find()
[13:29:37] <WebDragon> ravenzz: AHA I see where things went wahooni-shaped
[13:29:47] <ravenzz> :D
[13:30:15] <ravenzz> it is pretty straightforward
[13:32:12] <WebDragon> http://msc.client-proof.com/floorplans.php works now
[13:32:28] * WebDragon slides the carafe of DragonCoffee™ over to ravenzz 
[13:32:45] <WebDragon> kind of you to make me think again -- brain needed a jump-start :D
[13:33:42] <WebDragon> and yeah it is; I'd just forgotten one of the fundamental aspects of it, and was using the selector that had been added rather than the wrapper that was in the base html
[13:34:26] <ravenzz> yo
[13:34:46] <WebDragon> can't wait to finish this project :D soooo close. just need to do the floorplans, edit the homepage image to fade it properly, and do the necessaries to get the navbar and contents working responsively
[13:35:01] <WebDragon> oh yeah and fix the forms
[13:35:19] <ravenzz> it is alwasy good to give the user a visual feedback, you should add a loading message/icon
[13:35:49] <WebDragon> on the fancybox? it should do that automatically. the picasa images themselves load very fast, but there IS a holding message that flashes briefly while it does
[13:36:02] <WebDragon> (loads the thumbs, I mean)
[13:36:37] <ravenzz> ah yes you are correct, sotty
[13:36:41] <ravenzz> rry
[13:38:03] <ravenzz> but why are you loading them that way? can't you cache them/its url and serve as html?
[13:40:30] <fALSO> salamalekos
[13:40:40] <ravenzz> hgroups can't contain element diffrent from heading ones btw
[13:40:54] <ravenzz> lol
[14:02:17] <Foxhoundz> Hello jQ
[14:02:19] <Foxhoundz> why so quiet
[14:04:20] <ryanneufeld> Sunday
[14:04:54] <alexr2> We're all simultaneously preparing for Sandy
[14:05:19] <Foxhoundz> Ahhh
[14:05:45] <Foxhoundz> I guess everyone in the jQuery community lives on the east coast
[14:05:56] <alexr2> North east
[14:13:56] <fission6> is there a preferred way to do populate a dictionary so that if the key exists then push() to the value array, if it doesn't then add new [value]
[14:15:20] <ryanneufeld> something like dictionary[key] = dictionary[key].push(value) || value
[14:15:25] <ryanneufeld> might work
[14:16:11] <ryanneufeld> fission6: or rather something like dictionary[key] = dictionary[key].push(value) || [value]
[14:16:12] <fission6> dictionary[key].push(value) || [value]
[14:16:18] <fission6> yea i can tru
[14:16:47] <fission6> its kind of weird though right
[14:17:05] <fission6> i dont htink thats opitmal is it cause am i assigning a whole new Array
[14:17:23] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it means that easch value would be wrapped in an array
[14:17:57] <jrajav> Um, I don't think push does what you think it does
[14:18:30] <ryanneufeld> jrajav: what is it you think I think it does?
[14:18:54] <alexr2> fission6, if (dict[key] != undefined) dict[key].push(val); else dict[key] = [val]
[14:18:55] <jrajav> Return the array it's being applied to, apparently
[14:19:02] <ryanneufeld> jrajav: no
[14:19:06] <jrajav> It returns the new length of the array
[14:19:11] <ryanneufeld> oh
[14:19:12] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:19:13] <jrajav> So you're going to be overwriting your keys
[14:19:22] <ryanneufeld> I see the problem with the code there
[14:19:26] <fission6> alex yea
[14:19:34] <fission6> can i not use 'in'
[14:19:46] <alexr2> no, this isn't python :-)
[14:20:13] <alexr2> in can only be used in for (var index in array) {}
[14:20:18] <jrajav> I would do it like this: if (dict.hasOwnProperty(key)) dict[key].push(val) else dict[key] = [val]
[14:20:25] <fission6> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in
[14:20:35] <fission6> its an operator
[14:20:44] <alexr2> oO
[14:20:51] <alexr2> i feel like i've tried that before but it hasn't worked
[14:21:00] <jrajav> "hasOwnProperty" is effectively the same as checking 'typeof dict[key] === "undefined"' here, but hasOwnProperty is more broadly applicable
[14:21:19] <jrajav> When you're working with object properties and not variables, at least
[14:21:56] <alexr2> ahh... works by key... how about that
[14:21:57] <ryanneufeld> jrajav: actuall, that's nice way of doing it.
[14:22:15] <alexr2> learn something new every day
[14:22:55] <jrajav> ryanneufeld: push probably *should* return the array :)
[14:23:00] <jrajav> Alas, Javascript
[14:23:31] <ryanneufeld> jrajav: yeah, I shouldn't have had the left hand side of that assignment
[14:23:45] <ryanneufeld> dictionary[key].push(value) || dictionary[key] = [value]
[14:23:51] <ryanneufeld> I think that would work better
[14:24:13] <jrajav> Eh, I don't like writing side-effect statements into boolean logic like that
[14:24:15] <ryanneufeld> though you still have the case where now everything is an array. which may be a pain
[14:24:18] <jrajav> Just use 'if' at that point
[14:24:32] <ryanneufeld> jrajav: yeah, but when you minify the code, that's often what it does
[14:24:52] <ryanneufeld> this example is a bad one
[14:25:00] <ryanneufeld> cause it could throw an error
[14:25:03] <jrajav> Well, let's ditch 'break' and just use goto for everything in C then
[14:25:15] <jrajav> It will all turn into a JMP instruction in the assembly anyway
[14:25:15] <ryanneufeld> the way I've written it isn't great
[14:25:15] <jrajav> :P
[14:25:29] <ryanneufeld> jrajav: apples and oranges
[14:25:40] <ryanneufeld> your mehod of hasOwnProperty is safer
[14:25:47] <fission6> is there a unique collection in javasceipt?
[14:25:49] <jrajav> Is it? The reason we don't use goto is because it breaks up the code flow, making it harder to read and maintain
[14:25:53] <ryanneufeld> And I'd probably use that
[14:25:56] <jrajav> I'd argue the same thing for boolean logic being misused
[14:26:28] <ryanneufeld> I just wrote it off the top of my head man
[14:28:28] <jrajav> fission6: Closest thing I can think of is 'uniq' function in prototype and underscore
[14:28:49] <jrajav> Running that function on every add operation for a custom collection would result in a unique set
[14:29:23] <fission6> yea

[14:34:04] <Kit-10> hi.  Trying to load a list of json files based upon a list. i populate a list on the return/success. once the list is complete i then call another function with the completed list (rendering)
[14:34:33] <Kit-10> the issue i have is that the list never completes as the list length is not the same as the items found/loaded
[14:34:44] <Kit-10> anyone know of a way around this
[14:34:45] <Kit-10> ?
[14:34:49] <ryanneufeld> ?demo

[14:35:03] <sente> that's one hell of a list
[14:35:11] <danheberden> can someone here do me a favor?
[14:35:17] <ryanneufeld> wassup?
[14:35:20] <danheberden> go to http://jqueryy.org
[14:35:24] <danheberden> and tell me if you get redirected
[14:35:26] <danheberden> to jquery.com
[14:35:32] <ryanneufeld> I does
[14:35:34] <sente> yes
[14:35:34] <danheberden> yay!
[14:36:40] <sente> why yay?
[14:36:44] <sunbeam> I need to code a design to a template using twitter bootstrap, but have never done this, is this hard?
[14:37:21] <sente> danheberden: now i'm not getting redirected
[14:37:25] <ryanneufeld> sunbeam: if you've never done it. It might be
[14:37:30] <sunbeam> ryanneufeld: ok
[14:37:40] <sunbeam> ryanneufeld: you use this often?
[14:37:42] <ryanneufeld> no
[14:37:51] <ryanneufeld> but you're asking a very subjective question
[14:37:51] <sente> ahhh your url is yy
[14:37:51] <ryanneufeld> I
[14:38:09] <ryanneufeld> sunbeam: I have never climbed a mountain, or ran a marathon
[14:38:28] <danheberden> sunbeam: yeah, it's someone that is scraping our site
[14:38:31] <ryanneufeld> sunbeam: So those things, while easy for some, will be very hard for me (cause I'm fat)
[14:38:34] <danheberden> but also hotlinking to our JS
[14:38:45] <sente> lol

[14:38:51] <Kit-10> my example/demo; http://jsfiddle.net/D2Crw/1/
[14:38:57] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: so, did you make the JS redirect?
[14:39:18] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: yeah, all i could do
[14:39:19] <sente> danheberden: i see
[14:39:22] <sente> so what's the point of this?
[14:39:27] <sente> the whole jqueryy.org -> jquery.com
[14:39:39] <ryanneufeld> sunbeam: jqueryy.org is NOT a legit site
[14:39:44] <ryanneufeld> sente: ^^
[14:39:50] <danheberden> it's old, clogs up google
[14:39:54] <sente> heh
[14:39:58] <sente>   $( 'head' ).prepend( '<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NONE">' );
[14:40:05] <sente> is that even going to work on robots?
[14:40:08] <ryanneufeld> sente: no
[14:40:10] <ryanneufeld> it will not
[14:40:11] <sente> yeah
[14:40:13] <danheberden> sente: google *does* parse js
[14:40:14] <sente> seemed pretty silly
[14:40:32] <danheberden> so figured worth a shot
[14:40:34] <sente> yeah i mean i know it wont work on robots.txt robots
[14:40:35] <sente> gotcha
[14:40:36] <danheberden> in the odd case that it does work
[14:40:46] <danheberden> if not, whatever
[14:40:50] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: it won't parse that
[14:40:54] <danheberden> it's still an FU
[14:41:10] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: we've tested to see what google parses, and they don't seem to parse conistently
[14:41:13] <sente> so jquerry.org is a bad site? and it's referencing .js files you control?
[14:41:16] <sente> that's what's going on here?
[14:41:19] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: oh, well, oh wells
[14:41:34] <danheberden> sente: yuppers
[14:41:35] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: if they parse it, I don't think they execute it
[14:41:53] <ryanneufeld> this is why hotlinking is bad
[14:42:07] <ryanneufeld> cause the people who you're hotlinking to can ruin your day
[14:42:42] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: i wonder if i obliterate the html?
[14:42:44] <sente> shouldn't you test for jqueryy.org
[14:42:46] <sente> not just jqueryy
[14:42:48] <danheberden> would that help google from indexing it?
[14:43:02] <danheberden> i mean, i know google will respond follow click handlers 'n shit
[14:43:23] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: #infra
[14:43:38] <Kit-10> I have an issue with loading items via jQuery - http://jsfiddle.net/D2Crw/1/  the issue is that not all items in the list exist. As such the someOverFn never fires

[15:27:26] <mr_daniel> Did I just found a bug in jQuery? I created a code snippet to get $(div).css('margin'); The snippet works for Chrome, but fails for Firefox returning an empty string: http://pastebin.com/Ju62nbCE
[15:28:58] <mr_daniel> Basically I programmatically create a div with JavaScript, clone it and append it to the body. The div gets margin through a CSS-class
[15:37:45] <lampe2> hey is there a way for a resizeable element to give it an array like: [0,12,59,80,100]. so in the Y axis it only can have this values ?
[16:07:38] <lampe2> hey iam looking for something that i can change in size on the x and y axis and give it some values to which they snap like: xval[0,12,50,70,100] . i was doing this with resizable but i cant give it the values...
[16:21:29] <devslash> can you add a jquery control to a jquery ui tab ?
[16:21:43] <devslash> i tried doing that but the control doesn't appear.
[16:23:57] <jtomasrl> im trying to make an ajax request to send some json data, but the data is not beeing send as json through the wire
[16:23:59] <devslash> is anyone here
[16:24:17] <jtomasrl> i get some Line-based text data: application/json
[16:34:42] <brend_> hello
[16:34:50] <brend_> did anyone tried uploadify here?
[16:37:41] <alexr2> jtomasrl, make sure you're setting the datatype as json, see ?ajax
[16:37:53] <alexr2> grr
[16:37:57] <alexr2> ?ajax @ jtomasrl
[16:38:09] <alexr2> dead bot?
[16:39:01] <brend_> ?
[16:42:35] <jtomasrl> alexr2: i did
[16:43:06] <alexr2> jtomsarsl, jsfiddle.net please
[16:44:48] <brend_> is it something wrong here as im still not getting nothing when i upload http://pastie.org/5129712
[17:17:32] <fission6> is there a simple one liner to help me generate an array to use for pagination ajax request, meaning if there are 1000 items and i get 100 at a time, and i pass in a query param start_element, i want to generate [0, 100, 200, 300, 400, ....]
[17:21:10] <rmurphey> fission6: no one-liner but it's simple enough, just push values to an array til you get to the max value you want
[17:21:22] <rmurphey> using a for loop or a while loop
[17:22:33] <fission6> i realized i am already using _., so i can use _.range
[17:27:57] <syskaw> Hi, sorry for my english i'm french.  In this code : http://pastebin.com/ZDzz9Qk2 I try to execute redraw function in clicked function but I fail, if someone has an idea how to ? thanks you
[17:28:36] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[17:31:57] <brend_> im dealing a lot to upload files using ajax
[17:32:04] <brend_> still cant make it work
[17:33:26] <Cronoh> u should follow a tutorial
[17:34:39] <brend_> there is not to much information on the topic.. just a few pluggins
[17:35:35] <alexr2> ?g jquery form @ brend_
[17:35:43] <alexr2> man is the bot dead or somethin?
[17:35:55] <alexr2> brend_: http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/
[17:36:30] <fission6> lets say i make 50 ajax calls through when(ajax...ajax50) does the browser still queue those, cause clearly it wont open 50 connections right?
[17:37:10] <alexr2> fission6, it should queue them
[17:37:18] <alexr2> that's a lotta ajax calls though
[17:37:25] <alexr2> kinda breaks the whole point of the protocol
[17:37:34] <alexr2> why not just send it with one call?
[17:37:53] <brend_> alexr2:  should i have to change my php upload script with this pluggin?
[17:38:18] <alexr2> not much brend_
[17:38:27] <alexr2> it can upload as a regular POST request
[17:46:17] <fission6> alexr2: sorry what
[17:46:20] <fission6> what do you mean
[17:46:31] <fission6> why not just send it with one call
[17:46:54] <alexr2> you're making 50 calls.... combine all the data you're sending into 1 call, and send just the 1 call
[17:48:01] <fission6> they are all gets to an api
[17:48:11] <fission6> i have to paginate :(
[17:48:23] <fission6> 100 items at a time, 10,000 items
[17:48:34] <fission6> this is in a chrome plugin, not a typical user experience
[17:48:35] <alexr2> the point of ajax is to get data as you go... not get all the data at once, and then handle it later on
[17:49:24] <fission6> alexr2: i agree
[17:49:36] <fission6> butin the case things are a bit different
[17:49:46] <fission6> or "outside" the normal web dev paradigm
[17:50:53] <alexr2> think you might need to rethink the way you're making your program then :-P  50 ajax requests that you NEED to be done immediately means that it could be a while before a user can even use your plugin
[17:55:33] <fission6> alexr2: lag is expected
[17:55:40] <fission6> again, this is a one off internal tool
[17:55:53] <fission6> they needs to aggregate a bunch of calls and provide a report to a user
[17:56:35] <alexr2> okay, the one thing i would worry about is that some of the requests may time out
[17:56:44] <alexr2> so you might want to put in handling for that if it happens
[17:56:50] <alexr2> and redo the time'd out requests
[18:09:49] <tff> Hi, is there any consensus as to what the 'best' jquery-based rich text editor is these days?
[18:09:59] <tff> (Or non-jquery for that matter, I guess)
[18:10:17] <tff> Seems like there are a lot of random editor plugins that are decent
[18:10:23] <ShawnRisk> how come the top left images are not working in my pastebin code: http://pastebin.com/1gyFvaTn but in my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/19/ they are?
[18:11:36] <alexr2> tff, tinyMCE seems to be the most popular one imo
[18:14:03] <mg983> Hi guys -- I can't figure out why this is happening, (make sure you expand the Result pane to be a fair amount wider). http://jsfiddle.net/3aU9t/  There are a number of steps to replicate this -- drag from the left side "First" to the #2 spot. Drag the dropped (orange) rectangle to the #3 spot, back to the #2 spot and then when you try to drag and drop it the div does not actually move… anyone know what is causing this?
[18:17:16] <tff> alexr2, Ah, that's right, I checked that out at one point. Seems pretty well supported
[18:17:36] <alexr2> tff, I've only used it once, but didn't have any issues
[18:20:18] <devslash> how do i have an event when my control has finished loading ?
[18:24:26] <alexr2> devslash, what do you mean?
[18:24:45] <devslash> i have a jquery file tree and I'm trying to run code only when it has fully loaded
[18:24:53] <devslash> but i can't seem to figure out how to do it
[18:25:02] <alexr2> devslash, look into LABjs
[18:25:22] <devslash> ???
[18:25:24] <devslash> whats that
[18:25:45] <alexr2> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=LABjs
[18:26:16] <devslash> thats not what I'm looking for
[18:26:27] <alexr2> That's what you asked for though :-)
[18:28:05] <mbrochh> hey friends. since .serialize() does not submit data from file input fields, how do I upload images when posting a submit via AJAX?
[18:28:06] <alexr2> You can also use $(document).ready(function() {})
[18:28:09] <azbyin> hi all.. I've got a image/png data uri as the href for an anchor element.
[18:28:22] <alexr2> mbrochh, look into jquery form
[18:28:30] <azbyin> how would i force the browser to save this image on clicking the a element?
[18:28:38] <brend_> mbrochh:  im dealing with the same issue
[18:29:02] <devslash> no it isn't
[18:29:30] <devslash> $(document).ready(function() {}) doesn't work either as it doesn't activate when my control has fully loaded
[18:29:32] <ShawnRisk> how come the top left images are not working in my pastebin code: http://pastebin.com/1gyFvaTn but in my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/19/ they are?
[18:29:42] <alexr2> azbyin, add an onclick event, use preventDefault(), and handle the attribute with .attr('href')
[18:29:43] <mbrochh> alexr2: you mean the jquery form plugin?
[18:29:48] <alexr2> mbrochh, yes
[18:29:54] <mbrochh> ok thanks
[18:30:02] <alexr2> It can ajax submit forms with files attached
[18:30:16] <azbyin> alexr2, what do you mean by 'handle the attribute with .attr('href') ?
[18:30:28] <alexr2> devslash, then I'm assuming your control loads after the page has loaded, so you need a callback function
[18:30:45] <azbyin> i understand you want the default action prevented, but how exactly is it 'handled' ?
[18:30:45] <devslash> how do i assign a callback
[18:31:06] <alexr2> devslash, show me some code of how it currently looks.  jsfiddle.net if you need a place to show code
[18:31:26] <alexr2> azbyin, do you know about binding click events?
[18:31:35] <devslash> alexr2: can i pm you the link
[18:31:40] <brend_> mbrochh:  let me know if u make it work
[18:31:41] <alexr2> sure devslash
[18:32:03] <azbyin> yeah. and what to do in the click event apart from simply preventing the default behaviour ?
[18:33:02] <nitrix> Hi, I have a link with CSS properties as follow: a{color:#something} and a:hover{color:#FFFFFF}. The jQuery callback "click" is binded to it, so that when I click the link, it shows a div and also its text. That works, the problem is my link stays white until I mouseover it again.
[18:33:08] <alexr2> azbyin, use the .attr() jQuery function to get the uri that you need
[18:33:15] <alexr2> Once you have it, you can save it however you want
[18:33:51] <nitrix> Basically, the browser doesn't know my mouse left the link, so its still white. I tried to trigger mouseover and everything with jQuery but since it's a CSS property, it doesn't seems to work.
[18:34:10] <nitrix> Anybody has an idea?
[18:34:19] <devslash> alexr2:  see the pm
[18:35:13] <azbyin> right, you misunderstood the question. The data uri is obtained by calling a func within the canvas api.  var imgtosave = $("#mycanvas")[0].toDataURL();  $('body').append('<a href="'+imgtosave+'">Click</a>');
[18:36:02] <azbyin> this simply shows the image. i want it to be saved when the link is clicked. if i add target='_blank'  it simply opens in a new window/tab(depending on the browser)
[18:36:44] <alexr2> right azbyin, use an .on() event on body.  click handler as the event type, and "a" as the element type to watch
[18:36:49] <azbyin> "save" as in popup a file save dialog
[18:37:02] <alexr2> the function() should prevent default functionality (so it doesn't follow the link)
[18:37:11] <alexr2> and from there you can popup a dialog of any kind you want and handle it at that point
[18:37:25] <azbyin> err.. how would i popup the file save dialog?
[18:37:38] <azbyin> this 'handling' is exactly what i want to know about
[18:37:50] <azbyin> you have told me everything else around it!
[18:37:58] <alexr2> Look into modal dialogs.  I recommend bootstrapjs by twitter
[18:38:01] <alexr2> Very easy to use
[18:38:05] <azbyin> what? no
[18:38:18] <azbyin> i want the browser default file->save dialog to show up
[18:38:36] <alexr2> Ahh
[18:38:47] <azbyin> finally :)
[18:38:48] <ShawnRisk> How come my problem didn't get looked at?
[18:38:50] <alexr2> haha
[18:39:04] <alexr2> So like right click, save as?
[18:39:08] <azbyin> basically i want the same thing to happen when a pdf link is clicked
[18:39:30] <azbyin> browser usually pops up a save dialog (assuming the browser doesn;t have builtin pdf viewer)
[18:39:39] <azbyin> yeah, like right-click -> save image as
[18:40:13] <alexr2> Hmm
[18:41:38] <azbyin> i think i can force it if i change the mimetype of the data uri from image/png to application/octet-stream  but then the save dialog will not show an extension and the user might forget to add the .png extension and they will not know what the heck they just saved
[18:42:17] <alexr2> azbyin, I've never tried overriding default behavior of the browser
[18:42:25] <alexr2> I can't imagine that's cross browser compatible type stuff
[18:42:56] <azbyin> this is not really overriding.. just enabling one of the other builtin behaviours
[18:43:12] <alexr2> (in other words, overriding default behavior)
[18:43:14] <alexr2> :-)
[18:44:31] <ShawnRisk> alexr2: did you look at my problem?
[18:45:59] <alexr2> ShawnRisk, I have no clue what your problem is
[18:46:09] <ShawnRisk> :(
[18:46:20] <ShawnRisk> alexr2: see the top left images
[18:46:37] <ShawnRisk> I am wondering if you know what is wrong in my pastebin code that is making them not work?
[18:46:39] <alexr2> ShawnRisk, I have no clue what you're talking about man, show your full question
[18:47:12] <ShawnRisk> alexr2: above is the full question
[18:47:25] <aaronkwhite> I'm having issues getting my dynamically generated form fields to auto-focus, here is the code: https://gist.github.com/3970936
[18:47:47] <aaronkwhite> I think it's something simple… been staring at the code for a few days
[18:48:18] <ShawnRisk> alexr2: if you have no idea that is okay I will try again later
[18:48:47] <alexr2> aaronkwhite, try  jQuery("#dynamic_fields").next().focus();
[18:50:04] <aaronkwhite> tried that, didn't work
[18:50:50] <aaronkwhite> also tried: jQuery("#dynamic_fields :input").next().focus();
[18:54:35] <alexr2> 1 sec aaronkwhite
[18:54:50] <aaronkwhite> yep
[18:59:29] <alexr2> aaronkwhite, what are you trying to do with the code?
[19:00:09] <aaronkwhite> add new input dynamically and have the cursor drop in the new input field automatically
[19:01:02] <aaronkwhite> so i type text, and hit 'Return/Enter'
[19:01:12] <aaronkwhite> new input shows up and my cursor is already in the new input bo
[19:01:14] <aaronkwhite> box
[19:04:38] <alexr2> aaronkwhite, give me 2 mins
[19:07:56] <alexr2> aaronkwhite, look at http://jsfiddle.net/f83rE/1/
[19:08:19] <aaronkwhite> Thx alexr2!
[19:08:23] <alexr2> no problem
[19:08:24] <aaronkwhite> I'll give it a whirl
[19:09:12] <shoky> azbyin: you need to also set a header to set the content-name if you want the .png extension
[19:09:42] <azbyin> shoky, thats the problem.. the whole process is done client-side!
[19:10:06] <azbyin> img = $("mycanvas")[0].toDataURL("image/png");
[19:10:28] <azbyin> now theres no header to set because the image is already available to the client!
[19:10:37] <shoky> oh it's not an actual url?
[19:10:42] <alexr2> I honestly doubt that's even possible
[19:10:48] <alexr2> It's too much of a security risk
[19:11:28] <shoky> yah you'd need to send that back to the server, which would prepare a download link
[19:11:34] <shoky> i think.
[19:12:37] <alexr2> shoky, I've done that with files that the browser can't generally handle (like excel spreadsheets and such), but I feel like doing that with a png or jpg would also require overriding default browser functionality
[19:12:48] <alexr2> Which I'm not sure you can down with regular js
[19:13:02] <shoky> sending it back to the server?
[19:13:17] <shoky> why wouldn't that be possible
[19:13:20] <alexr2> naah not that
[19:13:29] <alexr2> sending it back to the client after it's at the server
[19:13:41] <alexr2> and having it go directly to the "download", rather than "view in browser"
[19:13:58] <shoky> if you set the headers right..
[19:14:02] <alexr2> yeah?
[19:14:04] <alexr2> *shrug*
[19:14:09] <shoky> content-disposition: attachment  bla bla
[19:14:23] <shoky> then i think it should work fine. been a long time since i played with that tho
[19:14:28] <shoky> so i might be totally off
[19:14:32] <alexr2> hehe , i have no clue
[19:17:19] <fission6> is there any plugins or tools to use on a webpage to dump json / js objects for debugging, like something more intuitive then console
[19:18:49] <shoky> azbyin, seen this? http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas2image/
[19:19:02] <alexr2> fission6, a lot of people like firebug for firefox
[19:19:04] <fission6> something that letes you collabse fielfs and such

[19:28:19] <klatoo> hmm how would i make it so that for the whole session, it doesn't slide down again? O_o
[19:28:23] <klatoo> any ideas?
[19:28:34] <klatoo> otherwise it keeps sliding down every page load
[19:30:10] <shoky> klatoo: make a demo of the issue on jsfiddle.net
[19:30:46] <klatoo> oh, interesting
[19:30:48] <shoky> choose jquery on the left
[19:30:50] <klatoo> never seen that before
[19:30:55] <shoky> ?jsfiddle
[19:30:55] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[19:31:53] <klatoo> cool gonna try it out
[19:32:37] <aqeel> hi room
[19:33:11] <aqeel> firefox say....resolution 1024x768 but ie says resolution 983x737
[19:33:15] <aqeel> any idea why
[19:33:27] <aqeel> where actual resolution is 1024x768
[19:33:33] <shoky> where does ie say that..
[19:33:39] <shoky> and.. what ie
[19:33:44] <aqeel> online resolution checking
[19:34:00] <aqeel> ie8 on xp sp3
[19:34:12] <aqeel> http://www.whatismyscreenresolution.com/
[19:34:51] <shoky> well.. either ie is dumb or the site is dumb
[19:35:10] <shoky> i dont think there's much more to say about the subject ;p
[19:35:47] <shoky> anyway, a browser shouldn't be able to know (or care) about my screen resolution :\
[19:36:00] <shoky> emphasis on should
[19:36:22] <aqeel> opera and safari also detetcs correctly
[19:36:28] <fission6> see this is cool http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/ but need that to embed on my page
[19:36:55] <shoky> aqeel: it's ie8. who cares what it thinks the resolution is?
[19:37:11] <shoky> who cares what any browser thinks what the resolution is
[19:37:23] <shoky> or any site that checks what the browser thinks
[19:37:37] <shoky> or life, or god, or the bible.
[19:37:59] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> When you do $('body').append(html); how can you know when the newly appeneded content is ready?
[19:38:11] <shoky> NICOLAS_Leonidas: what do you mean by ready?
[19:38:20] <klatoo> http://jsfiddle.net/jWzpZ/
[19:38:26] <aqeel> well people are still using 800x600 and i had a site that displays nothing any resolution less than 1024x768....and this could be huge problem for those why ahve set resolution at 1024x768 and se nothing
[19:38:28] <shoky> NICOLAS_Leonidas: it's already in the DOM by the time .append returns
[19:38:28] <klatoo> cool got it to work at fiddle lol
[19:38:29] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> shoky: so that I can select it in the next line, the same way document.ready works
[19:38:35] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> yeah?
[19:38:38] <shoky> NICOLAS_Leonidas: you can select it in the next line
[19:39:40] <shoky> klatoo: problem solved?
[19:39:46] <klatoo> i want for the #notice div to not slide Down after the user has clicked the X once (in subsequent page refreshes)
[19:39:56] <klatoo> do you know what i mean?
[19:40:07] <klatoo> would i use like PHP for that?
[19:40:20] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> shoky: doesn't look like it, I'm trying to use jquery ui .dialog() when I call it right after the injection it fails, but if I type it in console it works
[19:40:25] <klatoo> to somehow detect whether the user has already clicked on the X once in the session
[19:40:27] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> it seems like there is a delay
[19:41:11] <Cronoh> lkatoo you could use cookies if you didnt wanna interact with php for it
[19:41:12] <shoky> klatoo: for persisting data between page refreshes.. you need to persist the data somewhere ;P
[19:41:15] <Cronoh> lkatoon
[19:41:21] <Cronoh> your name is hard to type
[19:41:26] <klatoo> lol
[19:41:44] <shoky> ?demo @ NICOLAS_Leonidas
[19:41:44] <bot-t> NICOLAS_Leonidas, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:41:46] <klop> there, easier :)
[19:41:49] <Cronoh> lol nice
[19:42:02] <Cronoh> are you making like a one time ad for vising your site or something?
[19:42:17] <klop> no, its just a notice for using a coupon code
[19:42:21] <klop> for reddit visitors : )
[19:42:32] <klop> i am making a store
[19:42:35] <Cronoh> well functionally though, a popup that occurs basically once per session ?
[19:42:42] <klop> yes
[19:42:45] <Cronoh> or what rules are the none popup
[19:42:58] <klop> it will be a URL like
[19:43:06] <klop> www.mysite.com/?source=reddit
[19:43:09] <klop> and based on that
[19:43:10] <Cronoh> i think the simple way is using cookies, since javascript can read the browser cookies and set them, but i am no expert
[19:43:16] <klop> it will display the coupon code
[19:43:20] <klop> oh ok
[19:43:23] <klop> yeah cookies sounds good
[19:43:39] <Cronoh> just set like _couponDisplayed = 1 or whatever
[19:44:43] <Cronoh> ofcourse then users without cookies enabled will get it every page lol
[19:44:56] <klop> darn!
[19:45:24] <Cronoh> but who doesnt have cookies enabled: P
[19:45:29] <b1lly> well, if the webserver supports php, you can use sessions
[19:45:37] <b1lly> to recognize a user
[19:45:43] <b1lly> or set serverside cookies
[19:45:49] <b1lly> & set
[19:45:50] <b1lly> *
[19:45:56] <Cronoh> sure sessions would be simple you just have to use both then, output a session variable to whever you are outputting javascript
[19:46:21] <klop> alright
[19:46:33] <klop> i think i will do the jquery way first
[19:46:42] <klop> then trying to add php way
[19:46:45] <shoky> it's not a jquery thing
[19:46:54] <klop> oh ok
[19:47:03] <shoky> tho you can try $.cookie plugin
[19:47:15] <klop> oh ok so just javascript then
[19:47:18] <Cronoh> just google how to read and write cookies with javascript
[19:47:26] <klop> doing!
[19:48:13] <klop> this is my current website: http://memegoods.com/
[19:48:30] <klop> (im making a new version, which is what i will be querying you guys about : )
[19:48:31] <shoky> $_$
[19:48:39] <klop> but any things about that site are appreciated as well
[19:48:44] <klop> the cart doesant work in IE lol
[19:49:04] <klop> but i've resigned to that reality until a time when i figure out why
[19:49:12] <Cronoh> lol a decent idea for banking off the meme crave
[19:49:29] <klop> Cronoh: yes lol, i've had over 2,000 customers in 2 years
[19:49:35] <Cronoh> nice congrats
[19:49:39] <klop> good beer money
[19:49:48] <klop> but i feel i can penetrate the market even more this christmas
[19:49:54] <klop> last year christmas was great
[19:50:01] <klop> but first i want a very smooth UI
[19:50:16] <Cronoh> yea it definitely could use a facelift
[19:50:24] <fission6> hmm doesn't look like anything is neatly packaged
[19:50:33] <klop> what is 'packaged'?
[19:50:59] <Cronoh> Troll Face StickerTroll Face Sticker
[19:50:59] <Cronoh> $1.39
[19:51:06] <Cronoh> Shipping with Tracking to USAShipping with Tracking to USA
[19:51:06] <Cronoh> $15.95
[19:51:08] <Cronoh> lmao
[19:51:21] <klop> what's funny lol
[19:51:24] <klop> O_O
[19:51:26] <klop> D:
[19:51:37] <fission6> like i can just say $('#somediv').jsonDUMP()
[19:51:41] <Cronoh> lol just funny shipping is so expensive
[19:51:45] <Maverick|MSG> is it better to parse bbcode server side or client side (jquery/js/etc)
[19:51:59] <fission6> like i can just say $('#somediv').jsonDUMP(some_object) and populate that element with a interactive json viewer
[19:52:04] <klop> Cronoh: yes canada post has expensive tracking :(
[19:52:06] <snover> Maverick|MSG: yes.
[19:52:06] <b-ot> snover, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[19:52:20] <Cronoh> in usa tracking is included
[19:52:21] <Cronoh> :>
[19:52:29] <klop> yeah i wish i lived in usa for this lolol
[19:52:35] <klop> 95% of my customers ar USA
[19:52:38] <Maverick|MSG> thanks snover
[19:52:46] <klop> but honestly people dont care much about shipping to warrant paying for the tracking
[19:52:49] <Cronoh> you actually hold stock of these items and ship them from your house?
[19:52:51] <klop> (for stickers)
[19:52:52] <snover> Maverick|MSG: you’re welcome!
[19:52:55] <klop> yes Cronoh
[19:53:10] <klop> the stock isn't accurate there (working on that too, so it updates automatically)
[19:53:14] <Cronoh> who makes them?
[19:53:24] <klop> i do, through a print shop
[19:53:33] <klop> but i make all of the files and outlines and such
[19:53:33] <Cronoh> oh nice
[19:53:40] <klop> i need a gallery to show them off better
[19:53:43] <klop> they're pretty nice actually
[19:53:47] <klop> i used to have crappier ones
[19:53:57] <klop> but they're good for the car
[19:54:06] <klop> they don't fall off or get wet or soggy
[19:54:20] <Cronoh> nice
[19:54:23] <klop> ye
[19:54:30] <klop> its been fun as a source of beer money :)
[19:54:35] <Cronoh> yea
[19:54:43] <Cronoh> you should continue you could make it more than that
[19:54:46] <fission6> is there a plugin or module for logging to a dom element vs console
[19:54:54] <klop> im glad you think so
[19:55:06] <Cronoh> memes are large i havent looked but im not sure how many places sell the items, i am sure you compete with like cafepress
[19:55:15] <klop> yeah
[19:55:22] <klop> i used to advertise on reddit a bunch
[19:55:33] <klop> and it made me have like 100-150 visitiors per day from google
[19:55:34] <Cronoh> but if you could present clear advantages to using a site like cafepress, you could make a lot of money with it
[19:55:39] <shoky> fission6: well, there's stuff like embedded firebug
[19:55:47] <klop> but now its like only 30 visitors per day
[19:55:55] <klop> but still the conversion is like pretty high
[19:56:06] <klop> hmm advantages, yes
[19:56:09] <fission6> shoky: yes i know, but i want to sort of mimic that stuff in the dom / page for the user to see a few things
[19:56:18] <klop> thanks for the encouraing words Cronoh
[19:56:27] <Cronoh> you're welcome best of luck
[19:56:37] <shoky> shrugs
[19:56:41] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[19:56:52] <shoky> y u no shrugs
[19:56:52] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[19:56:57] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[19:56:58] <klop> lol i used to have like 600 likes on facebook
[19:57:06] <klop> for the domain memestickers.ca
[19:57:13] <klop> but then i switched it to memegoods and it went to 0
[19:57:21] <klop> sad times
[19:57:28] <Cronoh> ya that sucks
[19:57:35] <Cronoh> building a name is one of the hardest things to do
[19:57:41] <fission6> is there not a convenient plug in to print things to a dom element
[19:57:53] <klop> i hated the name memestickers.ca so i changed it but now i regret it
[19:57:57] <klop> lolol
[19:57:58] <klop> oh well
[19:57:59] <Cronoh> lol
[19:58:05] <Cronoh> decision is done
[19:58:08] <Cronoh> do it even better this time
[19:58:08] <klop> yup
[19:58:14] <klop> trying !
[20:04:06] <shoky> can't keep both?
[20:12:42] <tw2113> question for you shoky
[20:12:59] <tw2113> eh, nevermind
[20:13:02] <tw2113> was mis-reading something
[20:13:50] <shoky> y u tease
[20:13:51] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[20:14:32] <tw2113> i know
[20:14:52] <tw2113> i'm dealing with trying to update "views" on items in a slider, with a mix of jquery, maybe ajax, and php
[20:14:59] <tw2113> all from in a slider
[20:15:10] <tw2113> i'm not getting very far
[20:16:41] <shoky> break it down, piece by piece, divide&conquer, and all that . .
[20:16:48] <shoky> is my heartfelt advice
[20:16:55] <tw2113> <3
[20:17:15] <tw2113> the task was easy when it was youtube videos i was dealing with
[20:17:18] <tw2113> they track that already
[20:17:23] <tw2113> i just need to grab the data from them
[20:17:51] <tw2113> now i'm dealing with user submitted stories to the client, and no real way of tracking that out of the box
[20:17:53] <shoky> not so smooth without your youtubes, are youuu
[20:18:18] <tw2113> nope
[20:19:04] <shoky> tomorrow is "fun" day at work, outdoor activities all day.
[20:19:12] <shoky> i'm sooo staying home
[20:19:16] <mouse-_> what, sandbag the storm?
[20:19:20] <mouse-_> that's a fun game lol
[20:19:59] <shoky> not everyone lives on the east coast (or in the US) and is gonna get slaughtered by the wind tonight
[20:19:59] <mouse-_> if the power cuts out at work..you could encounter some risque coworker situations
[20:20:13] <shoky> < in israel
[20:20:17] <mouse-_> nod ;D
[20:20:31] <shoky> we had our first storm 3 days ago. it lasted ~30 minutes
[20:20:44] <nights> hi
[20:20:59] <nights> is this a bad practise? $('#ORDER_LINK_*').click(function(){ ...
[20:21:09] <shoky> probably
[20:21:19] <nights> what is better?
[20:21:30] <shoky> i donno, what's #ORDER_LINK_*  ?
[20:21:43] <nights> i have a list of orders
[20:22:01] <nights> and when user press one i want to toggle a simple class on that
[20:22:19] <nights> but if i use a class as the selector for the click
[20:22:34] <shoky> better is to give them a shared class, then use event delegation like:  $('#container').on('click', '.order_link', function(e) { ... });
[20:22:36] <nights> then all objects would be toggling a class
[20:22:51] <Cronoh> $('id^=ORDER_LINK'). ?
[20:22:53] <nights> im not sure why i havnt ran into this before
[20:23:04] <nights> Cronoh: isnt that the same as the wildcard operator tho?
[20:23:07] <shoky> Cronoh: that's not good practise
[20:23:17] <Cronoh> oh lol
[20:23:29] <nights> i dont think it is easier
[20:23:32] <nights> must be very slow
[20:23:39] <nights> if you have like a 1000 objects
[20:23:44] <nights> ?
[20:23:46] <shoky> use event delegation
[20:24:01] <shoky> like i showed, only one event handler, even if you have a million links
[20:24:08] <nights> yeah
[20:24:13] <nights> thats what i mean
[20:24:47] <nights> shoky: dont every object need a unique id tho?
[20:25:03] <nights> container can be padded with order id?
[20:25:21] <shoky> i donno what you're doing..
[20:26:20] <nights> i have a list of orders and when user press one i want to toggle a simple class on that
[20:26:21] <shoky> probably they don't need a unique id. the data might need ids, but not the DOM elements. unless you have something that depends on the ids in the DOM elements, which would be bad practise
[20:26:40] <nights> ok
[20:26:43] <nights> thats great
[20:27:21] <nights> but whats up with container then?
[20:27:28] <nights> theres only one of that?
[20:28:04] <shoky> it should be the closest container element that has all the links, yea
[20:28:29] <nights> ok
[20:28:41] <shoky> if there is no such container, either make one, or you can always use $(document).on('click', '.order_link', ...
[20:29:16] <nights> hm yep
[20:29:17] <nights> there is
[20:29:30] <nights> just full of some inline style markups too :(
[20:29:54] <nights> hope that doesnt interfere
[20:30:18] <shoky> shouldn't
[20:31:42] <nights> so
[20:31:53] <nights> $(this).toggleClass('order_selected');
[20:31:57] <nights> what should be instead of 'this'
[20:31:58] <nights> ?
[20:32:02] <nights> e?
[20:32:19] <shoky> still this
[20:32:32] <nights> doesnt work then :(
[20:33:04] <shoky> put a demo up on jsfiddle.net
[20:33:23] <nights> put an alert inside and that doesnt get called either
[20:33:24] <nights> ok
[20:34:38] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> shoky: you were right my friend, the problem was from something else
[20:34:43] <shoky> also did you look at your javascript console
[20:35:25] <nights> yes
[20:35:26] <nights> no errors
[20:36:54] <nights> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/LFJSa/
[20:37:14] <nights> very simple example
[20:37:20] <nights> basically covers what i want to do
[20:37:38] <shoky> nights: if you choose jquery on the left, it works
[20:38:01] <nights> oh wow
[20:38:07] <nights> hmm thanks
[20:38:12] <shoky> ;p
[20:38:19] <nights> then i guess its probably the style messing it up
[20:38:34] <nights> ok perfect, very simple and neat. thanks vm
[20:38:47] <shoky> yw
[20:45:05] <nights> shoky: wonder if it could be because the content inside orderview_panel is ajax loaded?
[20:45:14] <nights> and the event needs to be rebound or something?
[20:45:48] <nights> also there is a onclick attached to the ORDER_LINK
[20:48:13] <nights> no diff.
[20:48:55] <Akki> Guys, hope u can help me with this, I am use a Jquery dropdown and just below that I have a content Slider also a plugin for Jquery (Basic JQuery Slider) now when I hover over the dropdown its fine it opens up but as soon as the pointer goes above the area of the slider the dropdown vanishes
[20:49:18] <Akki> I guess its the hover of the Slider that might cause the problem
[20:49:30] <Akki> any ideas how to get around this?
[20:49:45] <nights> lol
[20:49:45] <nights> ok
[20:49:49] <nights> found the "error" :)
[20:53:14] <Akki> any idea guys?
[20:53:44] <klop> what is the default expiration for javascript cookies?
[20:53:45] <Akki>  I am using a Jquery dropdown and just below that I have a content Slider also a plugin for Jquery (Basic JQuery Slider) now when I hover over the dropdown its fine it opens up but as soon as the pointer goes above the area of the slider the dropdown vanishes
[20:55:07] <Jakobud> hey everyone, quick question: if I have form elements that are in an array, like name='product_ids[]' how would I get the values of that array in jQuery?  For example, <input type='hidden' name='product_ids[]' value=1/> <input type='hidden' name='product_ids[]' value=2/>, how would I get the product_ids array in jQuery?
[20:55:34] <Jakobud> I tried serializeArray() but that gives an array of objects
[20:56:32] <nitrix> 5
[20:56:43] <nitrix> How do you have a cron execute something every 15 minutes?
[20:56:49] <nitrix> I'm always confused by the nomenclature.
[20:57:08] <nitrix> 0 * * * * is every hours?
[20:57:28] <coldhead> that is the least #jQuery question i have seen in a lonnng time :)
[20:57:42] <coldhead> man cron
[20:57:44] <nitrix> Ah crap, My Alt+5 didn't work.
[20:57:49] <nitrix> That's why, sorry guys.
[20:58:02] <crab> hi coldhead.
[20:58:08] <coldhead> hey crabsy
[20:58:41] <crab> if i have a bunch of HTML as a string (returned in response to a .get() or .post()), what's the best way how do i extract all, say, <script> elements from it? $(responseText) and loop over the resulting array?
[20:59:09] <crab> s/how do i/to/ (sigh, that'll teach me to try to edit things i wrote earlier)
[20:59:42] <Akki> Hi coldhead, crab , can I bother u guys with a small problem I am facing?
[21:01:00] <crab> ask your question. someone will answer if they can.
[21:01:27] <Akki> I have a Jquery menu and a Jquery plugin slider
[21:01:54] <asdflkasjdflka> hello, can anyone here help me with this programming?
[21:01:56] <asdflkasjdflka> or editing swf
[21:02:04] <Akki> problem is when I hover over the dropdown menu but its in the area of the slider the menu vanishes
[21:02:32] <asdflkasjdflka> anyone?
[21:02:55] <asdflkasjdflka> can anyone help me with something? i'm editing swf
[21:03:08] <Akki> i have set the zindex for the slider very low and I have increased the zindex for the menu
[21:03:37] <coldhead> crab: $(ur_ajax_data_here).find('script') // or whatever ?
[21:03:52] <coldhead> Akki: it works fine in my imagination, do you have a live demo somewhere?
[21:04:38] <Akki> nope the code is not with me right now
[21:05:01] <Akki> but I will try to make a small example and pass it
[21:05:14] <shoky> .filter('script') more like
[21:05:41] <Akki> well I am using the basic jquery slider
[21:05:46] <coldhead> .filter('script').find('script').andSelf() more like
[21:06:10] <coldhead> i understand, Akki, but the basic jquery slider is the one that works perfectly in my imagination
[21:07:09] <Akki> ok I will try to create an example but unfortunately I dont have a server right now :(
[21:07:23] <coldhead> can you host it on jsfiddle>
[21:07:48] <Akki> thanks Coldhead :)
[21:11:16] <brend_> hi.. can anybody please tell me why im not getting the form clean and the alert message here.. thanks http://pastie.org/5130552
[21:13:08] <coldhead> brend_: line 9 is very weird
[21:13:21] <coldhead> if it's a function call you probably want to append ()
[21:13:31] <coldhead> and you might also want to check the spelling
[21:14:02] <brend_> coldhead:  have u ever used the pluggin?
[21:14:32] <coldhead> no i haven't, it's my first day using jQuery
[21:14:59] <brend_> coldhead:  i mean the jquery form pluggin
[21:15:07] <Foxhoundz> coldhead: your JSON is broken
[21:15:12] <Foxhoundz> I mean, brend_*
[21:15:24] <brend_> json?
[21:15:43] <brend_> im not using jason data
[21:16:47] <brend_> the data is being send perfectly i just want to clean the form and send message after submit
[21:17:23] <coldhead> but line 9 is just a reference to a variable
[21:17:36] <coldhead> and if the variable is misspelt then the JS will die there
[21:17:40] <coldhead> with an error in the console
[21:17:45] <coldhead> are you seeing an error in the console?
[21:17:54] <Foxhoundz> disregard that...I wasn't looking closely
[21:18:33] <janthony> I am trying to find out the best manipulation for an insert. I have a table with class'es on the tr.'s. the first 3 tr.'s may have a class of "foo" and the the 4th and 5th tr.'s may have a class of "bar". I want to insert a tr after the last tr with a class of "foo". any ideas?
[21:19:11] <brend_> let me check
[21:22:10] <brend_> well for some reason return false is not working
[21:24:21] <Jakobud> does anyone know how to return from a function if you are in a closure that is within the function?
[21:25:26] <coldhead> closures are for variable scope, not execution paths
[21:25:41] <coldhead> returning from a function returns to the point where the function was called
[21:25:48] <coldhead> regardless of the closure scopes
[21:26:24] <janthony> n/m, figured it out. used .before() instead .after()
[21:27:07] <GoSox> is there a way I can pass an argument to a callback function ?
[21:27:41] <GoSox> $("#id").slideDown( my_function($variable) );
[21:27:58] <coldhead> $("#id").slideDown( function () { my_function($variable) } );
[21:28:16] <GoSox> really? that seems soooooo awkard
[21:29:22] <Foxhoundz> GoSox, probably because it's displayed all in one line
[21:29:52] <coldhead> GoSox: the alternatives are even more awkward
[21:30:06] <GoSox> fair enough
[21:30:09] <coldhead> it would be less awkward if you didn't have to type "function () {"
[21:30:24] <coldhead> in which case see coffeescript or ecmascript 6
[21:30:33] <coldhead> which have a nicer function syntax
[21:30:37] <coldhead> but until then i am sorry :(
[21:30:55] <coldhead> it's awkward to type but it's elegant executably
[21:38:17] <randomdev> Could someone help me figure out why when the checkbox is checked, the div is not hidden? http://jsfiddle.net/Y98eZ/
[21:41:14] <tw2113> randomdev, i don't see any div with an ID of output-shipto-display
[21:41:16] <snowfox_ben> randomdev, what div is supposed to be hidden?
[21:41:23] <snowfox_ben> looks like you are hiding the wrong div to me
[21:41:26] <randomdev> i tried changing the div to that name didnt seem to help ?
[21:41:28] <snowfox_ben> output-shipto-display does not exist
[21:42:06] <randomdev> http://jsfiddle.net/Y98eZ/3/
[21:43:04] <snowfox_ben> that is a class not ID
[21:43:25] <randomdev> ah thanks
[21:43:31] <randomdev> i knew it had to be something obvious
[21:43:37] <snowfox_ben> :)
[21:44:13] <tw2113> might want to display the checkbox somehow both ways, in case someone accidentally clicks or changes their mind
[21:44:33] <snowfox_ben> Right. I agree with tw2113, I would move that label out of the div
[21:45:20] <randomdev> yup, thanks
[22:11:45] <GoSox> i used to write html and php, but i feel like all i do these days is write javascript
[22:11:49] <GoSox> and i don't even like javascript!
[22:12:38] <snowfox_ben> Its a good thing to know...
[22:14:16] <snowfox_ben> Alright, JS wizards...
[22:14:17] <snowfox_ben> http://jsfiddle.net/RTKbe/1/
[22:14:55] <snowfox_ben> When a checkbox is checked, I need to add/remove something from a HREF in an effort to create a custom URL generator…of sorts
[22:15:16] <snowfox_ben> basically, if a box is checked, I want to add something to a HREF value, if it is unchecked, remove it
[22:15:22] <GoSox> your HTML is like 90% classnames
[22:15:36] <snowfox_ben> Yeah, welcome to Drupal land :P
[22:15:50] <GoSox> ummm no thanks ill stay home
[22:15:59] <snowfox_ben> Population: Millions of websites
[22:16:34] <snowfox_ben> Its distracting, I will remove it, but that has nothing to do with my issue
[22:16:59] <GoSox> i have no doubt you are right but i can't even read your html
[22:17:18] <snowfox_ben> its more of a JS issue, nothing wrong with the html
[22:17:22] <snowfox_ben> I am cleaning it up tho
[22:19:45] <snowfox_ben> Cleaned up…same problem: http://jsfiddle.net/RTKbe/2/
[22:20:20] <GoSox> so what is the problem?
[22:20:25] <GoSox> and what is it that you want to happen
[22:20:48] <snowfox_ben> When a box is checked, maculate the anchor's href
[22:20:51] <snowfox_ben> for example
[22:21:26] <snowfox_ben> 3-5th grade is checked, so I would like the url to be something like
[22:21:42] <snowfox_ben> example.com/grade=7
[22:21:48] <GoSox> ok soooo sound like you need a little switch in there
[22:21:50] <snowfox_ben> 7 is the value of that checkbox
[22:22:04] <snowfox_ben> but if two boxes are checked I would want
[22:22:15] <snowfox_ben> example.com/grade=7&grade=8
[22:22:19] <GoSox> ah
[22:22:32] <GoSox> php has a function for turning an array into a nice GET string
[22:22:35] <GoSox> i don't think javascript does
[22:23:54] <GoSox> snowfox_ben: i do something very similar on this page
[22:24:36] <GoSox> well the page isn't actually working but
[22:24:48] <snowfox_ben> heh
[22:24:56] <GoSox> every time a checkbox is clicked, i just if () through all checkboxes, building a string
[22:25:09] <snowfox_ben> Yeah, that sounds like what I want to do
[22:25:31] <snowfox_ben> only dif is will set the string to the href value
[22:26:00] <GoSox> Pastebin is currently undergoing some planned system maintenance
[22:26:02] <GoSox> sun of a bitch
[22:26:06] <GoSox> son even
[22:26:35] <GoSox> snowfox_ben: http://jsfiddle.net/9YBJA/
[22:26:47] <GoSox> thats the general idea
[22:26:56] <GoSox> ill show you it in action in a second...
[22:28:37] <snowfox_ben> Ok, I will hold
[22:29:12] <GoSox> snowfox_ben: http://www.menulizard.com/by-zip-code/
[22:29:17] <GoSox> type in 01801 as your zip code
[22:29:20] <snowfox_ben> You love slideUp btw :P
[22:29:31] <GoSox> then check filters
[22:29:57] <GoSox> if you're going to go with that whole "AJAX" style, you might as well go with it completely
[22:30:42] <snowfox_ben> I am using AJAX
[22:30:49] <GoSox> i know i'm just saying
[22:30:58] <GoSox> lots of slideups and slidedowns
[22:31:05] <snowfox_ben> Oh, yeah, gotcha
[22:31:29] <snowfox_ben> The other day you were asking about slideUP, as I recall
[22:31:35] <GoSox> so just do what i did, and then instead of doing a GET, add your built string to the domain name, and add it as the attribute
[22:31:48] <GoSox> yeah issues with slideUp/Down and google maps
[22:31:52] <snowfox_ben> Right
[22:31:56] <GoSox> http://www.menulizard.com/by-nearby/
[22:32:26] <snowfox_ben> Neat
[22:32:52] <GoSox> on that page, teh Cuisine box is just a layout test, they don't actually DO anything. but the filter checkboxes all do real actual STUFF
[22:34:45] <fission6> is there a good style guide for writing clean"er" code that has a lot of call backs and nested functions
[22:35:24] <GoSox> i don't know but i can tell you this, taking the time to clean up your code is always time well spent
[22:35:41] <Auger> does anyone know of a script i can use that has text that floats around in a circle?
[22:35:48] <fission6> yes i know, trying to find a good style guide to clean up my code a bit
[22:35:54] <coldhead> fission6: http://kevzettler.com/Programming/2012/09/30/write_your_javascript_like_its_lisp.html
[22:36:06] <fission6> thanks coldhead
[22:36:21] <coldhead> that is both cleaner AND you can say "look it's like lisp" and you will get mad respect for being an oldschool beardy comp sci guy
[22:36:47] <fission6> thanks coldhead
[22:37:00] <Auger> would lub you forever
[22:37:29] <fission6> any other references coldhead
[22:38:14] <coldhead> i've seen a few other docs that make the same point: avoid anonymous functions
[22:38:52] <GoSox> i use an uncommon style of indenting that most people find odd, but i find it makes my code very readable
[22:39:05] <coldhead> there is also this https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js/ but that doesn't have anything about callbacks that i can remember
[22:39:14] <GoSox> http://www.menulizard.com/js/findby.js
[22:39:25] <coldhead> ya gosox, consistency is more important than herd mentality
[22:40:08] <GoSox> i also start variable names with $, because that's what i've been doing in PHP for a decade. And if it doesn't start with a $, it doesn't look like a variable to me D:
[22:40:26] <fission6> hmm
[22:40:29] <coldhead> GoSox: people are gonna hate on that { indent style :)
[22:40:36] <coldhead> but kudos for going your own way
[22:40:44] <GoSox> coldhead: luckily that doesn't bother me one bit :)
[22:40:59] <phiz> yeah where did you make that up from
[22:41:06] <coldhead> GoSox: the code where you keep testing properties and setting things, if ( $("#open").prop("checked") )
[22:41:10] <coldhead> i would make that a function
[22:41:11] <GoSox> i dunno, i've been doing it that way foreever
[22:41:13] <phiz> i've never seen that { } style before
[22:41:36] <coldhead> maybeSet('selector', 'prop', '&get=whatever');
[22:41:43] <coldhead> a better fn name i suppose
[22:41:48] <coldhead> but then you'd get them in a line each
[22:42:12] <GoSox> coldhead: it is itself inside a function. I don't think i can benefit much more by making MORE functions in that existing function
[22:42:22] <coldhead> let me demonstrate then!
[22:42:32] <GoSox> plus sometimes being a little verbose can help make it easier to change things 18 months from now
[22:44:41] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/hVdMg/
[22:44:49] <coldhead> if i had to edit a lot of them i'd much prefer the second form
[22:45:06] <coldhead> rather than have to worry about {s and }s for every prop
[22:45:25] <coldhead> yes of course, it's a matter of taste
[22:45:47] <phiz> tastes good to me
[22:45:57] <GoSox> yeah i see what you did there, but… meh
[22:46:09] <phiz> coldhead: your way is more elegant
[22:46:46] <GoSox> testprop is a custom function right?
[22:47:00] <GoSox> so you have to add that function to teh code as well
[22:47:07] <GoSox> so at the end of the day, you're saving like 4 lines
[22:47:18] <GoSox> i'd rather just leave it as is
[22:47:23] <snowfox_ben> ok…almost got this...
[22:47:24] <GoSox> maybe later when i'm doing many many more
[22:47:35] <GoSox> it will make more sense to switch over
[22:47:42] <phiz> i could see someone that is used to using a hammer (php) everything starts looking like a nail.
[22:47:57] <coldhead> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/hVdMg/1/
[22:48:02] <coldhead> that's how i'd implement testprop
[22:48:29] <coldhead> i like how that lets you keep the getString in a closure and add to it programatically
[22:48:41] <coldhead> and then you get it via another function whenever you want it
[22:49:09] <GoSox> but i'm always going to want it, and i'm only going to want it, immediately after doing all my checks.
[22:49:18] <GoSox> for my actual usage, i just don't see much benefit
[22:49:32] <GoSox> other than saving just a few lines of code
[22:49:41] <GoSox> also your indent style is so werid!
[22:49:42] <GoSox> :P
[22:49:47] <coldhead> GoSox: for me the benefit is only having to write one if () {}
[22:49:58] <coldhead> rather than a whole new if for every prop()
[22:50:13] <coldhead> aside from being less actual typing, it's less code to screw up
[22:50:22] <GoSox> yeah but we're only talking about 9 total if's
[22:50:33] <coldhead> fewere places for the browser to say "unexpected }"
[22:50:43] <coldhead> 9 ifs is a lot :)
[22:51:25] <coldhead> i'm sorry, i will remove my didactic hat and put on my "smiling otter pictures" earwarmers
[22:51:25] <snowfox_ben> Here we go: http://jsfiddle.net/RTKbe/4/ Last wrinkle
[22:51:40] <snowfox_ben> Two sets of checkboxes
[22:52:54] <CWSpear> Sorry, I'm just not joining the conversation, but is there a reason you're not using serialize() for that last fiddle?
[22:52:56] <snowfox_ben> to build my string (a URL), I need the checkboxes with the name "field_grade_tid[]" to have that value prefixed, and items with the name field_program_type_tid[] prefixed with that value, and then the value
[22:53:34] <snowfox_ben> CWSpear, me?
[22:53:40] <CWSpear> yeah
[22:53:53] <snowfox_ben> I don't know what you are talking about- so maybe that explains it
[22:53:55] <phiz> GoSox: it is hard to learn stuff when you refuse to admit there are better ways of doing things.
[22:53:59] <CWSpear> I think with the correct markup, you could get everything you want with a $('form').serialize()
[22:54:18] <snowfox_ben> looking it up...
[22:54:21] <CWSpear> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[22:55:18] <snowfox_ben> oooo
[22:55:49] <snowfox_ben> going to try this out immediately...
[22:57:35] <snowfox_ben> holy smokes, CWSpear!
[22:57:43] <CWSpear> What is it, Robin?
[22:57:58] <snowfox_ben> That worked great
[22:58:02] <CWSpear> Sweet
[23:00:46] <mdedetrich> php is the ugliest language that is still being massively used
[23:00:50] <mdedetrich> I wish it would dioe
[23:00:56] <mdedetrich> oh wow
[23:00:58] <mdedetrich> scroll fail
[23:01:11] <snowfox_ben> heh
[23:01:27] <CWSpear> JavaScript's right up there. Well. Sorta
[23:01:42] <CWSpear> maybe not in function naming scheme
[23:01:55] <snowfox_ben> JS is the most "popular" language, so its got that going for it
[23:02:31] <CWSpear> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXEgk1Hdze0
[23:02:44] <CWSpear> ex de facto, but because it is a great language
[23:03:14] <mdedetrich> JS is no way near as bad as PHP
[23:03:33] <mdedetrich> JS is actually quite a nice language in that it has really good constructs around OO and functional programming
[23:03:43] <mdedetrich> PHP is a giant mess
[23:04:02] <CWSpear> I won't disagree with you there, but you should definitely check out the video.
[23:04:04] <mdedetrich> JS biggest problem is missing module support, which is being fixed now, that and it has a retarded type coercion system
[23:04:49] <mdedetrich> CWSpear: yeah I know, the famous NaN thing in J
[23:04:51] <mdedetrich> *JS
[23:04:59] <mdedetrich> again thats the type coercion I'm talking about
[23:05:06] <CWSpear> I'm digging the batman references tonight
[23:06:14] <CWSpear> So what's causing you bring up PHP tonight?
[23:10:54] <mdedetrich> CWSpear: my scroll was one hour behind
[23:10:55] <snowfox_ben> GoSox mentioned in passing that he does PHP - typical conversation eventually ensued.
[23:11:01] <mdedetrich> and there was a conversation around PHP
[23:11:34] <GoSox> it was only a matter of time i suppose
[23:11:46] <snowfox_ben> Of course.
[23:11:57] <mdedetrich> Im sorry, but you mention PHP to a 'proper' computer scientists
[23:12:00] <mdedetrich> and you get a mob after you
[23:12:10] <mdedetrich> its like one of those scary internet mobs
[23:12:31] <GoSox> what server side language do proper computer scientists use?
[23:12:41] <mdedetrich> anything thats not php
[23:13:05] <CWSpear> Haha, I went to school for Computer Science, too, and I will agree PHP is awful in a lot of regards, but I still use it.
[23:13:27] <CWSpear> Almost exclusively on a good framework.
[23:13:46] <mdedetrich> even then, I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole
[23:14:08] <CWSpear> So do you have a preferred language you work in?
[23:14:52] <snowfox_ben> I work in PHP but don't know if I prefer. Learning Python now
[23:15:20] <GoSox> i've been working in php for about a decade, and its awesome
[23:15:21] <GoSox> i love it
[23:15:25] <snowfox_ben> well, I just started learning Python and Ruby…want to test drive both for a bit then decide
[23:15:36] <GoSox> i get so much more joy working on php server side stuff than i do jS client side stuff
[23:15:48] <synapt> mdedetrich: In all honesty what people view as 'proper computer scientists' probably aren't doing things right to begin with, seeing as that's not usually a title you see used in any legitimate development role
[23:16:14] <mdedetrich> CWSpear: I worked in java,scala,ruby,node.js
[23:16:16] <synapt> PHP is fine, if you don't fall into the drowning crowd of people who use things like w3schools and wordpress as their 'examples' of learning from
[23:16:16] <GoSox> 10 years ago i was thinking about going with apple's WebObjects, but ended up going with php. THANK YOU GOD for that one
[23:16:44] <synapt> or school, have yet to see any form of PHP taught in school that was done even remotely correctly...
[23:17:03] <CWSpear> You've seen a school that teaches it?
[23:17:14] <mdedetrich> synapt: Even with good frameworks, you still have great PhP issues
[23:17:24] <mdedetrich> synapt: the minute you try to scale outside of your framework
[23:17:43] <synapt> CWSpear: There are schools that teach a variety of web languages, they're generally all horrible though and taught by people who have no idea what they're doing
[23:17:47] <GoSox> what is so terrible about php?
[23:17:54] <synapt> mdedetrich: Don't agree with that at all
[23:18:03] <GoSox> i agree function names are inconstant but that's not that big a deal
[23:18:06] <mdedetrich> GoSox: its a completely non deterministic that has no structure or design principles
[23:18:13] <synapt> Seeing as my current client uses one of the most horrendous PHP frameworks there are, and we still have it scaling fairly well
[23:18:17] <mdedetrich> GoSox: its basically a massive mix of global functions
[23:18:39] <mdedetrich> synapt: with no proper currency support, compared to anything else out there, PHP is probably the worst language you can scale
[23:18:46] <CWSpear> Neither do a lot of languages at their base.
[23:18:50] <synapt> mdedetrich: Like I said, don't really agree at all
[23:18:56] <mdedetrich> CWSpear: actually they do
[23:19:00] <synapt> PHP scales rather impressively if you -know- how to, lol
[23:19:05] <CWSpear> The structure comment
[23:19:10] <synapt> most people don't because they never look into making decent and optimized code
[23:19:15] <mdedetrich> synapt: Its not a thing of agree or disagree, it doesn't support concurrency
[23:19:28] <mdedetrich> you have to scale horizontally if you want to scale at all
[23:19:40] <mdedetrich> the best you can do is running multiple PHP process's
[23:19:42] <synapt> mdedetrich: As a web based language, it's fine, I'm not saying use it to write something that will act persistant and listen like some form of daemon
[23:20:00] <mdedetrich> synapt: you were talking about scalability, not persistance
[23:20:12] <mdedetrich> CWSpear: it doesn't have any structure
[23:20:26] <mdedetrich> CWSpear: I mean compared to the other main web languages
[23:20:28] <synapt> Sorry misread your line, though you're talking now like someone who's never used PHP outside of like apache and cgi
[23:20:33] <mdedetrich> its the least structured out of all of them
[23:21:11] <CWSpear> Ruby has better structure out of the box? Classic ASP?
[23:21:22] <mdedetrich> well the thing is, scaling with PHP is completely reliant on your framework, which is not a good thing
[23:21:38] <synapt> It's reliant on your setup
[23:21:41] <mdedetrich> CWSpear: ruby as a language design, has much better structure
[23:21:52] <mdedetrich> its a pure OO language which proper classes and whatnot
[23:21:58] <mdedetrich> with proper functional programming as well
[23:22:07] <synapt> ie; Run with lighttpd+php-fpm compared to apache+cgi
[23:22:13] <synapt> not -just- the framework
[23:22:31] <mdedetrich> synapt: its not just that
[23:22:33] <coldhead> they're all just turing machines, people!!!
[23:22:40] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[23:22:45] <mdedetrich> PHP for example is also blocking, even if you use lighhttpd threading hacks
[23:23:00] <synapt> like I said, my current client has one of the worst PHP frameworks running their site, and we still managed to scale it to impressive performance
[23:23:13] <GoSox> coldhead: so i didn't use your idea on that particular lump of code, but i did use your idea on another lump of code elsewhere in my site
[23:23:23] <synapt> a lot of it comes from caching, a lot of it comes from our own optimizations, and a lot came from when we put it on lighty and php-fpm
[23:23:26] <mdedetrich> synapt: yup, and my main point is, if you coded it the other languages I mentioned, it would have scaled much better
[23:23:33] <mdedetrich> the only reason PHP scales well is because of caching
[23:23:35] <synapt> mdedetrich: Still don't agree
[23:23:52] <mdedetrich> synapt: no thats pretty much true
[23:23:55] <synapt> Other languages (and yes I play with other languages too) still need caching at some level
[23:24:00] <coldhead> oh cool GoSox, i hope it saves you or some maintainer a few seconds sometime in the future
[23:24:20] <GoSox> i wish my editor could color code function names
[23:24:23] <mdedetrich> synapt: you have to realize, when I make a statement that PHP has scaling issues, I mean in comparison to all the other main web languages out there
[23:24:25] <synapt> mdedetrich: Here's the thing, it's not true when people disagree, so do stop trying to push it off as fact just because it's -your opinion-.  Facts !== Opinions, massive massive difference :P
[23:24:44] <mdedetrich> synapt: it is a fact that PHP runtime scales worse than all the languages I mentioned ;)
[23:24:57] <CWSpear> So jQuery...
[23:25:03] <synapt> I know well what you're saying, I've heard it many times before, just as I've heard it about other languages too, fact is it comes down to the person or people doing the code, and most of the time the people complaining of PHP really never worked it actively or got into it, lol
[23:25:08] <synapt> CWSpear: Sup?  lol
[23:25:09] <CWSpear> Pretty awesome, eh?
[23:25:20] <synapt> CWSpear: To be honest, I find it a bit bloaty, but it does have it's uses :P
[23:25:33] <mdedetrich> synapt: well I am making an assumption that in all cases (PHP and the other languages) the person generally knows what they are doing
[23:25:41] <mdedetrich> and my statement still holds true for that
[23:25:46] <GoSox> to be honest, i find it a bit weird that i mention php in passing, and mdedetrich has been going on and on for 25 minutes now about how much he doesn't like it
[23:26:05] <mdedetrich> PHP was good in that it was the main driver for exploding the web
[23:26:12] <synapt> mdedetrich: Well I'd say your assumption is a bit naive then, if you had any clue anything about doing proper PHP, you'd already know what you were saying isn't accurate
[23:26:13] <synapt> :P
[23:26:14] <CWSpear> that's probably my fault. I did ask why he brought it up
[23:26:22] <mdedetrich> because it was very easy for non CSE type people to approach and make websites
[23:26:26] <mdedetrich> but that does have its downsides
[23:26:51] <mdedetrich> synapt: does PHP do proper non blocking for any type of operation + concurrency support
[23:26:54] <synapt> every language has downsides, it'd be boring if there was one absolute perfect language
[23:27:24] <mdedetrich> synapt: I am saying right now, if you chose a well supported and fast framework to code a PHP website in
[23:27:38] <CWSpear> agree to disagree, already
[23:27:41] <mdedetrich> and you used a well supported and fast framework in something like node.js
[23:27:52] <mdedetrich> the node.js will outperform PHP, even with lighthttp and whatnot
[23:28:14] <synapt> lol
[23:28:51] <mdedetrich> and there isn't anything that you can do about it in PHP, because PHP gives you no control over blocking or concurrency
[23:28:52] <synapt> CWSpear: People who've never worked long or perhaps at all in something they vividly dislike will never agree to disagree
[23:29:01] <synapt> it's like asking an apple fanboy to admit androids have similar features
[23:29:17] <mdedetrich> my main problem with PHP is that its not a proper language
[23:29:26] <mdedetrich> the things I said are proper features of a language
[23:29:29] <GoSox> synapt: bad example, all apple fanboys think androids do have similar features because they copied them all. just ask me :)
[23:29:29] <CWSpear> omg, Android sucks. It can't do anything Apple phones can
[23:29:33] <mdedetrich> thats really a fact, its nothing to do with fanboyism
[23:29:56] <synapt> mdedetrich: I'm guessing you've never actually looked into the socket features of PHP at all
[23:30:07] <synapt> mdedetrich: Your opinion and apparently limited experience with PHP, definitely not fact
[23:30:36] <synapt> GoSox: In all honesty the original iPhone took some of it's features from other things, so, if android phones really did 'copy' them, then they're just doing what apple did
[23:30:39] <mdedetrich> synapt: yes I know PHP sockets
[23:30:45] <mdedetrich> synapt: that doesn't prove your point at all
[23:30:59] <mdedetrich> I'm not talking about sockets…..
[23:31:00] <GoSox> synapt: good idea, lets have two unrelated debates at the same time!
[23:31:32] <CWSpear> I was totally kidding. I'm fine with either phone and I personally have an HTC Amaze
[23:31:44] <synapt> GoSox: Well it technically founded the point, you just defended apple on something, but you apparently like apple, without realizing there were devices before even an iPhone that had similar functionality >.>
[23:32:05] <synapt> mdedetrich: If you knew PHP sockets you would know there are some non-blocking functionalities, I was just using sockets as an example
[23:32:36] <GoSox> i don't even remember what my point was, because i'm mostly focusing on this code i'm writing
[23:32:40] <GoSox> yay menulizard.com !
[23:32:59] <mdedetrich> except that its not a direct non blocking interface, its using sockets which does non blocking. If you are going to use sockets to do non blocking stuff, you are going to chock the IO of your website lol
[23:33:04] <synapt> Though admittedly like I said earlier, I still wouldn't necessarily use it, as even with PHP being my main thing, I admit I don't find it fitting in any form of persistant thing
[23:33:21] <CWSpear> Not trying to strike up another debate, what IRC client do you Mac users use? I use Adium, and maybe it's just the theme I'm using, but it always seems to assign people similar colors, so it's hard to identify who is speaking by color.
[23:33:33] <mdedetrich> CWSpear: I use textual
[23:33:39] <GoSox> CWSpear: colloquy and i hate it, but it's the least worst one i've found
[23:33:43] * synapt is used to a lot of people using coloquy
[23:33:57] <synapt> there's always irssi too, but I amusingly managed to segfault it my first time using it
[23:33:59] <GoSox> CWSpear: colloquy has good color picking
[23:34:19] <snowfox_ben> hey CWSpear_, that worked great on change, but if I need that same serialize function to work on page load..that should work too?
[23:34:26] <CWSpear_> Say something crazy, like you're wearing woman's underwear
[23:34:36] <phiz> excuse me?
[23:34:44] <CWSpear_> everyone's orange
[23:34:52] <mdedetrich> synapt: unless I am wrong, as far as I am aware, PHP does not provide a generic non blocking interface, all of the implementations interface with some C library or use message queues, which have obvious overhead
[23:35:02] <phiz> heh
[23:35:37] <synapt> mdedetrich: Primarily no, but I believe that was stuff to eventually come in the now-defunct 6 unfortunately
[23:35:40] <mdedetrich> in any case, doing generic non blocking code in PHP is very ugly, because it has no real language structure to support it
[23:36:05] <mdedetrich> in JS you have callbacks, and scala you have actors
[23:37:22] <CWSpear> snowfox_ben: yes, if they are checked
[23:37:51] <mdedetrich> its just the way that PHP was designed, its just a massive collection of functions that are called (with no real concept of first order functions or classes or objects), so coding any kind of generic non blocking/concurreny is going to be very ugly in PHP and will cause lets of issues in determisn
[23:38:47] <mdedetrich> *determinism
[23:39:17] <mdedetrich> I'm not surprised non blocking IO didn't make it in the language, it probably would have broken it in some way
[23:41:23] <csehl> when using jQuery.address, i will inevitably end up having the # in the url, because it doesnt use pushState?
[23:45:02] <CWSpear> csehl: I'm not sure I understand the question. What's jQuery.address? Is it a plugin you're using?
[23:47:02] <csehl> CWSpear: yes, its similar to history.js http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/docs/#sample-usage
[23:48:20] <CWSpear> I'm not sure. Why are you using this instead of History.js if you want pushstate stuff?
[23:49:07] <csehl> CWSpear: because its extremely simple to use along the structure and click events i have already built up
[23:51:37] <GoSox> what the 'and' operator in JS again?
[23:51:57] <CWSpear> GoSox is it not the same thing as &&?
[23:52:53] <mdedetrich> GoSox: its &&
[23:53:41] <CWSpear> csehl: I'm not sure, it doesn't really say. I'd have to actually try it out. Are you using it and it has # in your URLs? It looks like that's what it's purpose IS according to the one short paragraph on that main page.
[23:57:09] <Cork> csehl, CWSpear: history.js uses # as fallback if .pushState isn't supported
[23:57:09] <csehl> CWSpear: yes, im using it and it works flawlessly at the moment, the only thing disturbing me is, that countrary to most modern ajax apps i will have the #/ in the url and eventually in a bookmark, too
[23:57:27] <Cork> and yes # is a known hack to do the same thing as pushState
[23:57:46] <CWSpear> Cork, I've used history.js a lot, but he's asking about address: http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/
[23:58:10] <Cork> CWSpear: i know
[23:59:05] <csehl> Cork: yep, history is offering that pushState in the first place. but since 'address' is very easy to implement into my code without any major changes, im wondering if i can achieve the same effect with it somehow.
[23:59:34] <Cork> csehl: read the code, thats normally the simplest way to get that info
[23:59:53] <csehl> because from what ive seen from history.js examples so far, i would need to turn my whole application upside down to make it compatible
