[01:04:46] <SudoNull> can somebody help me decode a jq script?
[01:53:35] <FilipNor1ic> decode?
[01:59:12] <Cork> i think he means understand
[01:59:48] <Cork> SudoNull: also don't ask for someone; ask the question
[02:00:20] <Cork> else ppl have to ask for the question to know if they can answer it, making the likelihood you will get an answer MUCH lower
[02:00:27] <SudoNull> nvm i go it figured out
[03:41:57] <mike_papa> What can be wrong if $('select').find('option[value="1"]'); works, and $('select').find('option[text="tag test"]');? Shouldn't it? It's hard to misspell 'tag test', but to make sure I even copy-pased it.
[03:42:19] <Cork> mike_papa: it isn't text it is content
[03:42:26] <Cork> so you can't select it like that
[03:42:50] <mike_papa> Cork: 'option[content="tag test"]'?
[03:43:26] <Cork> $('select option').filter(function() { this.innerText == 'tag test'; })
[03:43:33] <Cork> it isn't an attribute
[03:45:28] <mike_papa> Cork: ok... I'll do that then. But on the other hand this works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/nmvf6/1/ . That confuses me a bit.
[03:46:28] <Cork> eh... donno, that shouldn't match anything
[03:47:46] <Cork> might be some compatibility hack for old html or something
[03:48:02] <Cork> butg ya, normally that should give you an empty collection
[03:48:06] <Cork> but*
[04:01:01] <mike_papa> When using .autocomplete, I do, what I need with selected value in 'select' callback. Now I want to clear the input. If I do it in select callback it still gets selected value (I checked with debuger - it gets cleaned, but after select callback finishes, it gets populated again). Where can I stop it? What's called after 'select' callback?
[04:03:30] <Cork> mike_papa: there isn't one, you can return false from the select event though
[04:07:22] <Cork> mike_papa: that said, a better option might be to store the alternative value in a hidden field
[04:07:23] <mike_papa> Cork: Thanks. I cannot really find that in docs. Returning false will stop populating input, and returning anything else, or not returning at all will force it. There is lot of magic there.
[04:07:32] <Cork> so the display value stay consistent
[04:08:01] <Cork> mike_papa: no no magic, it is normal callback logic
[04:08:47] <mike_papa> Cork: I still can't see where input gets populated with selected autocomplete value. It's happening after select callback finishes.
[04:09:15] <Cork> it happens in an if case when the select event has been completed (if the return value is not false)
[04:09:41] <mike_papa> Cork: inside JqueryUI machine?
[04:09:59] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widgets/autocomplete.js#L302
[04:10:29] <Cork> mike_papa: inside the autocomplete widget
[04:12:30] <mike_papa> Cork: Thanks. That explains a lot. I'm not used to js or jQuery specific 'normal behavior' (like checking false from callback, and doing default things), and it's not mentioned in (at least that part) of docs.
[04:12:54] <Cork> mike_papa: the docs doesn't explain exactly what the code does
[04:13:11] <Cork> some of i you will have to look at what it does
[04:13:28] <Cork> also the false from callbacks is normal for any event handler
[04:13:33] <Cork> it isn't jquery specific
[04:16:35] <mike_papa> Cork: That's a good lesson for js begginer. Thanks.
[04:17:15] <Cork> mike_papa: that said, for normal events (select is a fake event) you should not use return but event.preventDefault()
[04:17:46] <Cork> ex. $().on('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault() });
[04:18:38] <mike_papa> Cork: ok. I'll keep that in mind. Seems like useful thing.
[04:18:54] <Cork> it lets you prevent browsers default action
[05:27:51] <Lope> I've got a web-app that I use regularly which us useful but a little tedious. So I've hacked it up using greasemonkey. My script adds my own event handlers to their interface. I re-add event handlers every time certain types of things happen, to ensure I catch the new elements etc. Problem is I think I've got duplicate event handlers being added. Meaning when I add an event hander to call function foo on element x, it doesn't replace the previous one, it adds
[05:27:51] <Lope>  another call to function foo for element x. So I think I'm gaining event handlers exponentially. The browser tab eventually crashes after using it for a while. How can I avoid this happening?
[05:28:14] <Lope> Is there some simple jquery mechanism to write an event handler to an element only if it doesn't exist?
[05:28:36] <Lope> Or do I need to store all the elements in an array and only add the event handler to new elements that have been found?
[05:28:59] <Lope> Or maybe mark the elements data-gothandler='1'
[05:30:32] <Cork> Lope: the correct solution is to add the event handler to a static parent
[05:30:41] <Cork> then you won't need to update it at all
[05:30:58] <Cork> (it's called delegated event handler)
[05:31:12] <Cork> Lope: read http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[05:31:39] <Cork> .bind and .delegate has been merged into .on now days, but that page is still a good read before you go to .on
[05:35:08] <mike_papa> .on and .off are pretty nice. More human-like approach than .bind and .delegate, at least in matter of naming. It's just so many events in js start their names with "on", that I was getting ".on" meaning wrong for a while. ;)
[05:48:23] <LeGorille> hi guys, how can I restrict an input field to show only integer > 0
[05:57:03] <froyos> I have a lot of divs with the class '.text' and each div is of varying heights. Now I want to write a jquery function such that it'll find only those instances of '.text' whose height is above 50px and change them to 50px
[05:57:06] <froyos> How can I do this?
[05:58:39] <froyos> I want the ones that have heights below 50px to be unchanged
[05:59:36] <LeGorille> $('.text').map(function() {   do your thing here   });
[06:12:18] <granden> Hi, I found this jsfiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/wq3zsdsu/  which does pretty much exactly what I want. Execpt I would like .getDate to return the date in full format. Like '2016-09-22' instead of just the day of month.
[06:12:32] <granden> Because I got an array of dates that I want to enable and going to check agoinst that instead.
[06:24:08] <froyos> @LeGorille Thanks! How do you say 'greater than 50px'?
[06:25:44] <froyos> I tried both -- height = (this).css 'height' ; if height > '50px'
[06:25:49] <froyos> both with and without quotes
[06:25:54] <froyos> and neither works
[06:26:15] <froyos> $(this).css*
[06:27:29] <froyos> ahh never mind i got it
[06:38:35] <AdamPDotty> granden: "dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd'," before th function should do that
[06:40:27] <granden> AdamPDotty: I tried it, http://jsfiddle.net/wq3zsdsu/3/ and it still returns as day of month.
[06:58:35] <tjz> hello guys
[06:59:20] <tjz> any ideas how we can achieve the 'language' and 'country' dropdown like shown at youtube bottom page?
[08:25:35] <bjornkri> I’m working on some legacy code that’s giving problems. A click should be intercepted, a request sent to a thing for tracking purposes, and then the link followed. Something like this:
[08:26:00] <bjornkri> Er. Wait, let me bin this
[08:28:44] <bjornkri> This is what I’m dealing with: http://jsbin.com/siyuhugija/edit?js and as mentioned in the comment, this is preventing users from opening links in a new window, because it just sets window.location in the callback.
[08:29:29] <bjornkri> My question is: is that necessary? Since we’re not doing anything with the response in the callback, I don’t really need to preventDefault and then set the window.llocation, right?
[08:30:08] <bjornkri> I’m missing some basic terms here so I don’t know how to google that :p
[10:26:44] * taplar dances
[10:55:37] <Dan39> what is the button() method? i dont see it in api, but a jquery-ui demo uses it. it looks like it just does jqelm.find('button')
[10:55:54] <Dan39> im guessing its a deprecated method..
[10:56:27] <taplar> button is a tag name
[10:56:36] <taplar> it's finding <button>'s
[10:56:43] <Dan39> -_-
[10:56:46] <Dan39> no shit
[10:57:01] <taplar> then i don't understand the question
[10:57:45] <Dan39> actually i think we are both wrong
[10:58:07] <Dan39> yep
[10:58:27] <Dan39> button() is added by jquery-ui and turns the selected element into a jquery-ui themed fancy button
[11:00:23] <taplar> ah, i read that as you were saying button() was just doing jqelm.find('button')
[11:00:32] <taplar> like a wrapper or something
[11:05:08] <Dan39> taplar: i said thats what i thought
[11:05:22] <Dan39> but wasnt sure because the jquery site doesnt have it in api reference :P
[11:05:26] <Dan39> which is why i asked here
[11:37:03] <catbadger> so i have two tables, one is a jqgrid, one is a seperate table for headers (as we need multiple rows of custom headers) making them line up is hell.
[11:37:07] <catbadger> the 8th circle
[11:46:35] <anli_> Should $.parseXML be aware of <?xml?>
[12:08:02] <pokerpoker> if i have $('.class') and i want to exclude one selector from being picked up, how can I do that?
[12:08:15] <pokerpoker> every .class, except when id=123
[12:08:25] <Gsham> hey poeple. I am making a page with a grid of profile images. When you click one I show more info in a box up top about this user
[12:08:33] <Gsham> should I make all those boxes and hide them?
[12:08:44] <Gsham> or should i use like json to hold all the info and then change one box
[12:19:11] <catbadger> Gsham yes. make them and hide them is probably best if you don't want to build the form dynamically. how many profile pics?
[12:19:22] <Gsham> 30
[12:19:50] <Gsham> and then when u click one i was gonna make the text inside the box change by grabbing data from an array of the 30 items
[12:19:52] <catbadger> pokerpoker google for  "css selector :not"
[12:19:56] <Gsham> but u say just make 30 hidden boxes/
[12:20:40] <catbadger> Gsham the most efficient way would be to get the data via ajax and build your form dynamically.
[12:20:49] <catbadger> like get each user's data on the click event
[12:21:07] <Gsham>  i was told for 30 thats not as good
[12:21:09] <Gsham> getting it at once would be better
[12:21:17] <Gsham> its not like 100 or 500
[12:21:30] <catbadger> so you'll never need to scale it up
[12:21:31] <catbadger> ?
[12:21:40] <catbadger> i always build for a million+ users lol
[12:21:45] <Gsham> its WordPress. u press next ppage to see mroe only 30 at a time
[12:22:14] <Gsham> more than 30 would be overwhelming
[12:22:16] <catbadger> ...
[12:22:33] * catbadger wanders back to real work
[12:22:34] <Gsham> its pagnated
[12:22:35] <taplar> pokerpoker: $('.class').not('#123')
[12:22:48] <Gsham> catbadger dont leave me!
[12:25:00] <catbadger> 1. you're wrong. 2. you're arguing against my advice. 3. I'm at work.
[12:28:02] <Gsham> oh boy.... one of those… ok nevermind. so many of those type on irc lately. arguing is good. we learn fomr it. get used to it
[12:31:57] <elit3x> Why does messageTeaser provide value, but teaser does not? -- var messageTeaser = String($('#message_content').text());   var teaser = messageTeaser.substring(1,4);
[12:32:41] <taplar> how long is messageTeaser?
[12:32:48] <AdamPDotty> a char?
[12:33:30] <elit3x> probably around 50 ? Ill look
[12:33:34] <elit3x> its going to vary though
[12:33:49] <AdamPDotty> Whats the point of String() here?
[12:34:36] <elit3x> AdamPDotty : Forgot that was still there.... I tried without string and it did same thing
[12:35:03] <elit3x> i am new to this language and thought for somereason maybe .text() was not returning actuall text
[12:35:26] <pokerpoker> can you do :  $('div').find('.one').find('.two').on('change',function() {} );  and have both .one and .two setup with on change event?
[12:35:40] <AdamPDotty> even then new String(text) or text.toString() would be more obvious
[12:36:38] <AdamPDotty> pokerpoker: $('div').on('change', '.one, .two', function(){}); should work
[12:37:06] <pokerpoker> is there a way to see which selector triggered the function?   either .one or .two?
[12:37:12] <elit3x> i would imagine neither is required in this scenarior since im using text() on the div content
[12:37:22] <AdamPDotty> you have "this" inside the function
[12:37:39] <AdamPDotty> like $(this).hasClass('.one')
[12:38:05] <AdamPDotty> elit3x: yes, just saying
[12:38:40] <AdamPDotty> so substring should work, if it does not, we need more information.
[12:46:41] <elit3x> AdamPDotty : I eliminated everything extra and still can not get it to work --> https://dpaste.de/hNm9
[12:52:17] <pokerpoker> #test.select   will match   <div id="test"><select>, correct?
[12:55:58] <AdamPDotty> wrong
[12:56:40] <AdamPDotty> elit3x: basically tested it and got spaces as result. Maybe same happend for you.
[12:57:01] <AdamPDotty> e
[12:58:16] <AdamPDotty> I just took the page you sent and removed the event handler and took a simple "div" instead of "#message_content".
[12:59:06] <AdamPDotty> pokerpoker: you want "#test select" or $('#test').find('select')
[12:59:47] <elit3x> yea it looks like it printed spaces in the log... i get the same result when i try to print teaser.length
[12:59:49] <pokerpoker> AdamPDotty, $(this).has('#test') does not seem to work?
[13:02:09] <arc_> pokerpoker .select would be a class called select. '#test select' will match that. or '#test > select' if you want it to be limited to direct descendants
[13:21:40] <elit3x> AdamPDotty : I used trim() and got the result i needed :) Didnt notice the blank lines
[13:23:42] <FieryCod> Hello
[13:24:41] <FieryCod> I got a question connected with a slide effect on clicking the specific link.a(href='#skills-container') Skills. How can I add a slide effect on click?
[13:24:55] <robertmaxrees> FieryCod use an event listener.
[13:25:37] <FieryCod> you mean id_of_a_link.on('click',function(){}) ?
[13:25:50] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:33:41] <Dan39> why doesnt $(this)('selector') work?
[13:33:52] <robertmaxrees> because $(this) doesn't return a function.
[13:34:03] <robertmaxrees> so there's nothing to pass to it.
[13:35:35] <Dan39> hmm
[13:36:09] <robertmaxrees> plus it'd be really confusing if it returned a function PLUS a bunch of methods.
[13:36:29] <Dan39> right
[13:36:42] <Dan39> so using find() is the proper way to do it...?
[13:36:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:37:31] <robertmaxrees> There's a way to smash all of that inside of $(), but i've always found it relatively unreadable.
[13:40:11] <Dan39> thats what i was getting at
[13:40:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd personally avoid it and just use .find()
[13:40:26] <Dan39> using find is fine i guess
[13:40:31] <Dan39> gotcha
[13:40:38] <robertmaxrees> it's much easier to read.
[13:40:47] <Dan39> thats what i have in many places already and its working well
[13:41:37] <robertmaxrees> that's what jquery uses internally for the other thing i was mentioning.
[14:25:04] <mmmveggies> for $('.child', '.parent') ?
[14:34:32] <robertmaxrees> mmmveggies yeah.
[15:07:48] <codecutter> how can I add a string at the end of a href attr, which already has a value, i'd like to add it at the end
[15:38:34] <plamb_> am i thinking about the fadeIn part of this code right
[15:38:35] <plamb_> $(this).attr('value','256').fadeIn(3000);
[15:38:53] <plamb_> doesnt seem to change how fast that attr appears
[15:49:24] <catbadger> nope
[15:49:28] <catbadger> that's not how you use that
[15:49:41] <catbadger> fasdeIn applies to elements
[15:49:50] <catbadger> @plumb^^
[15:49:58] <catbadger> @plamb_^^
[15:50:32] * catbadger wanders back to his desk and continues debugging this infuriating js issue
[15:55:22] <plamb_> how would you fade in an attribute
[15:55:25] <plamb_> or is that impossible
[15:55:52] <anli_> Isn't it ul.treview() for jquery ui treeview?
[15:56:06] <anli_> oops, meant ul.treeview();
[16:11:52] <shoky> plamb_ you can't fade an attribute like that, you'd have to keep changing the attribute on a timeout,  you can use .animate() for it if you want, if you supply your own `step` function.  what kind of element is this? what are you trying to animate
[16:13:50] <plamb_> its not that important
[16:13:53] <plamb_> was just wondering
[16:14:40] <shoky> fadeIn is just for opacity
[16:14:51] <plamb_> yeah
[16:15:05] <plamb_> basically on an <input> focus i wanted to fade the value attribute in
[16:15:11] <plamb_> but its not super important
[16:15:13] <shoky> oh..
[16:15:23] <shoky> thought you wanted the value to keep changing
[16:15:38] <shoky> that might be possible with some simple css transition

[17:49:06] <vacho> I have an inputfield for dollar value. I am using a jQuery plugin for formatting text-input fields with dollar formatting. This plugin ads a dollar sign ($) automatically to my input field. I am using jQuery Validate to validate my forms and now my validation broke because there is a $ sign in the input, so it cannot recognize the number. How can I fix this?
[18:12:45] <catbadger> server side validation is best validation.
[18:17:47] <jonez> catbadger, agreed
[20:51:25] <bolovanos> hithere
[20:52:41] <bolovanos> is there any reason why "$(document).on('activate.bs.scrollspy', function(e) {" is not being trigered on Chrome unlike IE ? http://bolovanos.atspace.cc/bootstrapTest/example/scrollspy.html
[20:54:42] <bolovanos> second - in IE it is triggered once, even if it should be triggered at the same time as "ScrollSpy.prototype.activate" in http://bolovanos.atspace.cc/bootstrapTest/example/scrollspy.js
[21:03:19] <bolovanos> ok - this could be solved be removing include of local jquery.min.js
[21:05:10] <bolovanos> in IE that attached event is triggered even if function to whitch it is attached is not being called
