[11:49:06] <dimi1947> when using ajax I never set the content type...as such the data dooes not go as JSON in the server...it goes with the default forma(form-url-encoded)....id it bad that does not go to ther server as JSON?
[11:54:19] <unCork> if you send data that isn't url encoded you should set the content-type ya
[11:54:50] <unCork> else you basically depend on the server not following the spec
[12:01:00] <dimi1947> no I am not syaing that...I am saying that data does not go as JSON...and if this is bad..for whatever reason
[12:27:00] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 do you mean it's being sent as formencoded?
[12:27:44] <dimi1947> yes...if you do not specify contenttype in an ajax reuest this is the format it goes
[12:27:53] <dimi1947> no json
[12:28:18] <robertmaxrees> that's fine... so long as the server is expecting that and you're expecting that, you're OK.
[12:28:26] <robertmaxrees> if JSON would be a better format, then use that.
[12:29:36] <dimi1947> what determines if JSON is better foram or no?
[12:29:44] <dimi1947> format
[12:30:07] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: your preferences.  if you want the contents of the data to be human-readable.
[12:33:05] <dimi1947> I see...
[12:33:41] <robertmaxrees> you'll find most folks are using JSON these days for that reasons.
[12:33:45] <robertmaxrees> *reason
[12:36:38] <dimi1979> you mean...to be readable?
[12:36:56] <robertmaxrees> human readable, yeah.
[12:39:18] <dimi1979> hmmm
[12:39:28] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:37:15] <CuirPig> is a new jquery object instance created every time a query happens or every unique time a query is called. In other words let x=$(".someclass") is different from some other time when you said, let y=$(".someclass");
[13:38:35] <robertmaxrees> indeed it is a new object each time.
[13:39:03] <CuirPig> could you create an object that stored unique query objects in a cache based on selection criteria and use that instead of querying the dom each time?
[13:39:08] <robertmaxrees> and that object only captures what exists at the time the object is created.
[13:39:17] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:39:41] <robertmaxrees> your 'x' and 'y' objects are "cached"
[13:40:18] <CuirPig> But the y object searches the domain a second time. Whereas if it just looked up the selection criteria and found a predefined x it might be faster
[13:40:55] <robertmaxrees> it would be faster - that's why a lot of people will initialize their plugin or whatever and make that "cache" part of the process :)
[13:41:16] <robertmaxrees> because those objects aren't "live", you need to manage that big yourself.
[13:41:28] <CuirPig> AHA! You are billiant. Thanks.
[13:41:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:42:24] <CuirPig> I am still working on my alignment methods and wondered if I could add a persistent alignment to a jquery object easily. By caching the jquery object the first time I aligned them it would work, maybe.
[13:45:08] <CuirPig> Adobe Illustrator, in which I do most of my work, the alignment panel is a total bust. It sucks. I finally have the ears of the devs for the alignment panel and was trying to emulate an illustrator environment showing the benefits of a new alignment paradigm.
[13:45:53] <robertmaxrees> ah, so you're just trying to build a PoC as a demonstration?
[13:46:33] <CuirPig> Exactly. They can't seem to understand why you would want to align a bunch of objects by their bottom to another object's top, for example.
[13:47:09] <CuirPig> I suggested that having a bunch of elements off-screen would align their bottoms to the window's top. They were having a hard time seeing it.
[13:47:10] <robertmaxrees> erm,
[13:47:15] <robertmaxrees> you mean edge-snapping?
[13:47:26] <CuirPig> Sort of.
[13:47:37] <CuirPig> More like aligning objects by predefined  points.
[13:48:07] <robertmaxrees> or just making sure two edges are aligned even if they're not next to each other?
[13:48:21] <CuirPig> Illustrator only allows the 6 standards: left, center, right, top, middle, bottom
[13:48:30] <CuirPig> that appliles to all objects
[13:48:38] <CuirPig> but sometimes you want to align a top to a bottom
[13:48:42] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[13:48:45] <CuirPig> can't do it easily in illustrator.
[13:49:20] <CuirPig> So by creating a reference object that you define an alignment point relative to, then you can align all object based on their relative points to that reference.
