[01:16:41] <_savage> If I have a jQuery object that contains a set of already selected elements (e.g. a bunch of <p>) and if I then have one of those elements, how can traverse the elements in the selection? For example, I'd like to get the next <p> in the selection given a specific one.
[01:17:22] <_savage> .next() refers to the sibling in the DOM.
[01:17:54] <robertmaxrees> generally people enumerate over the collection using .each() - can you clarify your use case a bit more?
[01:19:57] <_savage> robertmaxrees: for example, a "cursor down" event when a <p> has the focus should go to the next <p> in my selection, not the sibling of that <p> element.
[01:20:40] <_savage> robertmaxrees: you mean using .eq() and an enumeration that I manage in addition to the set of matched elements?
[01:21:10] <robertmaxrees> i was referring to .each()
[01:21:41] <robertmaxrees> but it sounds like maybe you're doing some kind of keyboard shortcut where you're trying to find the prior or following element in the collection?
[01:22:02] <robertmaxrees> might need to lean on .index() and .eq() to accomplish this.,
[01:25:43] <_savage> robertmaxrees: oh! I had missed indexâ€¦
[01:27:06] <_savage> robertmaxrees: I guess since I have $(this) as the current <p> and I have the collection, I can:  $collection.eq(index($(this)) + 1)
[01:27:35] <_savage> robertmaxrees: well, $collection.index() that is
[01:30:44] <_savage> robertmaxrees: that's the best I can do, huh?
[05:34:10] <paule32> hello
[05:34:59] <paule32> i have an .png icon on browser as ".iconA { background-image ..."
[05:35:07] <paule32> the icon will be displayed
[05:35:51] <paule32> but $(".iconA").draggable();  let me drag me the icon around within the browser
[05:36:06] <paule32> but x or y scroll bars will not be displayed
[05:36:30] <paule32> so, when icon comes out of frame view, the icon disappears
[05:37:29] <paule32> i have a "<div id="box" ...
