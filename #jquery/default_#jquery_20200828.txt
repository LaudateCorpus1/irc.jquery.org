[15:49:28] <shukryzablah> Hey, I'm trying to use jquery in a project using vanilla js without any build tools. Is there a way I can import jquery from node_modules or do I have to clone the jquery source from github?
[15:50:46] <shukryzablah> import jQuery from "../../node_modules/jquery/src/jquery.js" doesn't work.
[15:56:51] <shukryzablah> For now I had to include it with a script tag and basically assume it's existence in the modules.
[15:56:51] <shukryzablah>  
[18:43:56] <robertmaxrees> shukryzablah yeah, pretty much you'll have to copy it to a directory that's getting served.
[18:44:11] <robertmaxrees> you don't generally serve up the contents of node_modules :)
[18:47:47] <shukryzablah> Thank you
[18:48:16] <shukryzablah> What a silly ecosystem

[19:28:28] <robertmaxrees> audioburn not sure i'm clear about the jquery relevance to the question? :)
[19:28:43] <audioburn> robertmaxrees: datatables is a jquery plugin
[19:28:46] <audioburn> \o/
[19:29:03] <robertmaxrees> audioburn none of the code in that SO question is using jquery :)
[19:29:18] <robertmaxrees> might go ask in a django or python channel instead.
[19:29:50] <audioburn> robertmaxrees: don't tell me what to do
[19:29:54] <audioburn> robertmaxrees: jk i asked there too
[19:30:03] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: keep it over there then.
[19:30:04] <audioburn> got an answer on SO
[19:30:10] <robertmaxrees> not really relevant to this channel either way. :)
