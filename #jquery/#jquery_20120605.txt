[00:16:48] <pneftali> guys
[00:17:18] <pneftali> how do you hide/fadeOut/remove a div which is created dynamically in javascript ?
[00:17:41] <Hippie_> $(#id).hide();
[00:17:58] <pneftali> Hippie_: it doesnt
[00:18:53] <pneftali> ooops
[00:18:56] <Hippie_> add to your css .......... .hide { display: none !important; } ...... then use $('#id').addClass('hide');
[00:19:19] <pneftali> my bad thanks
[00:19:30] <Hippie_> what did you do wrong
[00:20:41] <pneftali> it's not working when i use class selector
[00:21:06] <ximarin> hi all, question: I have a select and the first option of it is disabled. How can I tell jquery to select this first disabled option? $("select:option:disabled").attr("selected", true); does now work
[00:22:11] <ximarin> answered myself: $("select option:disabled").attr("selected", true); works...
[00:28:39] <youngin> what yall think of coffeescript?
[00:28:53] <youngin> any reasons against it
[00:29:23] <tw2113> i heard it's exciting, but that may just be the caffeine youngin
[00:29:28] <youngin> he he he
[00:33:49] <someprimetime> is there a way to count the number of pixels scrolled in all browsers with the mousewheel event?
[00:39:52] <hooloovoo> someprimetime: think so. check out the scrollTop() function
[00:39:56] <hooloovoo> should work in all browsers
[00:40:55] <someprimetime> so something like.. $('#container').bind('mousewheel', function() { console.log($(this).scrollTop()); }); ?
[00:41:45] <hooloovoo> someprimetime: well if you wanna know how much has scrolled on just one event trigger you gotta compare to the previous scrollTop()
[00:41:48] <hooloovoo> and not really
[00:41:53] <someprimetime> hooloovoo: yeah this isn't gonna work
[00:41:57] <hooloovoo> it's $(document).scrollTop(); i think
[00:41:59] <someprimetime> i'm gonna need to use like event.delta
[00:42:00] <someprimetime> or some shit
[00:42:09] <someprimetime> event.wheelDelta
[00:42:14] <hooloovoo> someprimetime: oookay... you do that.
[00:42:15] <someprimetime> gah this is turning to be a PITA
[00:42:21] <someprimetime> thanks hoover
[00:42:56] <hooloovoo> just a thought tho, why don't you wanna to it the scrollTop() way?
[00:43:42] <hooloovoo> and what are you trying to do?
[00:45:22] <hooloovoo> ok nvm
[00:52:02] <nowotny-dev> hello... should jquery's .on() work like the old .live() on it's own or is some additional tinkering necessary...?
[00:52:34] <hooloovoo> nowotny-dev: it's a little different
[00:52:56] <hooloovoo> .live automatically attach events to document
[00:53:15] <hooloovoo> while .on works more like .delegate()
[00:53:48] <hooloovoo> $(docuemtn).on("click", "#yourelement", function() {  }); is more or less exactly like the old live
[00:58:17] <nowotny-dev> ok... that seems to work... :) thanks...
[00:58:39] <nowotny-dev> do you happen to know a good tutorial on that matter... documentation is a bit confusing...
[00:58:41] <hooloovoo> ofc you have to spell document right for it to work =P
[00:58:59] <nowotny-dev> :)
[00:59:18] <hooloovoo> nowotny-dev: hmm, sec.
[00:59:55] <hooloovoo> nowotny-dev: this lets you know why it works as it does, it doesn't really specify the jquery function tho http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[01:00:24] <hooloovoo> but if you understand that you'll find it much easier to use events like this in jquery
[01:01:07] <skylamer`> what's the "right" way to bind elements to handlers when they're not existing yet
[01:01:23] <hooloovoo> skylamer`: use .on() on a parent element
[01:01:24] <skylamer`> is that with specificing their parent and with on() call
[01:01:26] <skylamer`> ye
[01:01:28] <skylamer`> thx :)
[01:01:28] <hooloovoo> see previous link =P
[01:04:39] <nowotny-dev> hooloovoo: thanks... I'll check that out...
[01:07:27] <wroos> Hi. Is it possible to change this script http://www.techerator.com/2010/11/how-to-make-a-css-background-slideshow-with-jquery/ so that the content (the elements inside that div) isn't fading, just fade the background? Or does sombody know of any script that could do that? Fade a background image but not the text.
[01:09:22] <nowotny-dev> wroos: you can't fade the background alone... you'd have to have two divs on top of each other and then fade the bottom one...
[01:09:27] <hooloovoo> wroos: you can make one. i donk know of any that does it, though i guess there are plenty.
[01:15:32] <wroos> should i change the z-index of the inner elements? :S
[01:19:14] <wroos> my content is also fading...
[01:21:16] <poppiez> I've created this slideshow that allows modal windows to open on top of it. I've made it so that you can hit "Esc" to close the modal window but this causes all the current AJAX requests to abort. what would you recommend I do?
[01:21:47] <hooloovoo> ev.preventDefault() in your keydown event
[01:21:49] <hooloovoo> maybe?
[01:21:54] <hooloovoo> you can try
[01:22:35] <poppiez> that seems to do it
[01:22:37] <poppiez> thx!
[01:22:52] <klawd_prime> guys. i want to get this into jquery ui li.ui-tabs-selected a {outline: none;}
[01:23:00] <klawd_prime> wjat would i have to do to get it into the release?
[01:24:30] <hooloovoo> poppiez: no
[01:29:08] <Whirl3d> poppiez, lets see your slide show

[01:35:28] <ZUZ3L> Hi guys... I'm trying to send a Date (comma seperated) as function parameter, but because it's comma seperated it thinks that it's multiple parameters... what to do? http://jsfiddle.net/ZUZ3L/8nqQs/1/
[01:37:32] <WasserDragoon> hi, change event will fired on a radio button when it get's checked, but how to fire it as well when it gets unchecked? do i need to use the click event? because i'm using a label element as well...
[01:38:02] <SleepyPikachu> Morning all, did you miss me? :P
[01:38:16] <tw2113> with every spitball we could wet, SleepyPikachu
[01:38:21] <tw2113> :)
[01:38:41] <Cork> WasserDragoon: its triggered on the element thats checked
[01:38:46] <SleepyPikachu> That's because even the sleepiest of Pikachu's are ninjas :P
[01:38:52] <Cork> WasserDragoon: a radio element is never unchecked
[01:39:01] <SleepyPikachu> I'm fighting with this script - http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex1/ddsmoothmenu.htm
[01:39:12] <SleepyPikachu> on http://www.edesix.com/?page_id=392
[01:39:37] <SleepyPikachu> It's showing up something but not in the correct position and not what I would expect to see
[01:39:45] <WasserDragoon> Cork ok i should use the name attr instead of an id, Cork sure i'm using two radio buttons of the same name
[01:39:58] <WasserDragoon> so the one gets unchecked when the other one gets checked ;-)
[01:40:25] <Cork> WasserDragoon:  $(parent).on('change', 'input[name=""]', function() {})
[01:42:22] <WasserDragoon> Cork parent?
[01:43:44] <ZUZ3L> Can you see what's wrong here? I'm trying to send a date string to be converted to a real date, but it doesn't act the way I thought... http://jsfiddle.net/ZUZ3L/8nqQs/1/
[01:43:53] <Cork> WasserDragoon: a parent element
[01:44:02] <Cork> WasserDragoon: document if you don't have a better one
[01:44:06] <WasserDragoon> Cork yes, but why checking a parent element?!
[01:44:18] <Cork> its not, its a delegated event listner
[01:44:24] <Cork> so you don't bind one for each element
[01:45:58] <skylamer`> Ч"real date"Ч, ZUZ3L ?
[01:46:11] <ZUZ3L> I specified the function parameters as hours, minuts etc... that helped...
[01:46:40] <ZUZ3L> Does anybody see my msgs here or am I speaking to myself? :)
[01:47:29] <ZUZ3L> @skylamer: You know, not a string... :)
[01:47:44] <ZUZ3L> @skylamer: I fixed it, but thanks anyway :-)
[01:48:51] <Whirl3d> ZUZ3L considering it's 4:45 am est where I am at, you're lucky you aren't talking to yourself.
[01:49:11] <WasserDragoon> Cork ah ok i see, sorry didn't saw the second param
[01:49:17] <WasserDragoon> thanks
[01:49:28] <ZUZ3L> heheh, okay I didn't think of that. It's 9am here in Denmark :)
[01:49:29] <SleepyPikachu> that makes it 9:45am here in the uk ;)
[01:49:38] <ZUZ3L> 11am that is
[01:49:46] <SleepyPikachu> Denmark is crazy if it's currently on the hour
[01:49:57] <SleepyPikachu> UST is 09:49 right now
[01:50:05] <ZUZ3L> Lol... 10:50 :)
[01:50:09] <Whirl3d> <--stuck in Atlanta, GA US here
[01:50:56] <ZUZ3L> Well then go to bed guys... And thanks for your time... :-)
[01:51:18] <Whirl3d> bed is for the weak minded...lol

[01:53:35] <Whirl3d> I'm strictly a day3 person...day 1 is a fog, day 2 is okay, day 3 and I can focus, things make sense, life is good. of course day 4 and I'm halucinating, so I try to sleep around day 3.5 lol
[01:54:48] <xec> lol Whirl3d, what day are you on at the moment?
[01:55:04] <Whirl3d> about 1.5...just starting to focus a little.
[01:56:06] <Whirl3d> xec, how have you been? Anything fun in the ole todo bin?
[01:56:26] <xec> fun? no. just a booooring slider
[01:56:39] <xec> struggling with implementing it in the stupid cms
[01:57:03] <Whirl3d> which cms?
[01:57:08] <xec> ez publish
[01:57:22] <Whirl3d> it's stupid, huh? any good ones out there?
[01:57:28] <xec> not that i know of
[01:58:14] <xec> it's not horrible to be honest, but i have no idea why they named it "EZ", you would have thought they wanted to make it "easy", but failed miserably at that
[01:58:44] <Whirl3d> so are you working on the development side of it or the consumer side?
[01:59:27] <xec> it's for our company website, so consumer
[02:00:25] <xec> of course, the people who are in charge of our website have basically no idea what they are doing so they go ahead and buy some crappy service and then i need to help out with just about every little thing
[02:00:29] <xec> story of my life :P
[02:00:58] <Whirl3d> keeps you employed though. that's a good thing
[02:01:17] <xec> well that's just it, i have more than enough other stuff to do
[02:01:28] <xec> which is actually exciting work
[02:01:34] <xec> but this? gah! :D
[02:01:55] <Whirl3d> What industry is this?
[02:02:55] <xec> we're a sort of application service provider, except we deliver sort of everything, from networks and computers to monitoring and support
[02:04:52] <Whirl3d> just be glad you aren't working with attorneys
[02:05:06] <Whirl3d> or artists...lol

[03:11:32] <KrizOne> hi guys, just after some advice more than trouble shooting, what jquery file upload plugin is the best? Im having a hard time getting blueimp to work how it should, are there any others out there that offer progress bars and drag and drop uploads?
[03:11:33] <Xotix> hi, i have a html page  (doctype header body etc) as a string. Now i need to get the value of $('body').attr('style') hwo can i do that? e.g. if i have the string stored within the var myHtml i cant do $(myHtml).find(body), this doesn't work. also a console log of the jquery obj just shows the body's content
[03:16:25] <shoky> Xotix: jquery uses the .innerHTML property for that, and browsers tend to strip off some of those elements.. (doctype,html,head..)
[03:16:50] <shoky> Xotix: you're better off having an html string of just <body>'s content
[03:18:15] <shoky> or just search for stuff inside body and not body itself
[03:18:46] <Xotix> hmm ok i'll just add it as a property to my json stuff. thanks
[03:24:59] <Trudko> guys document ready trigges when DOM is loaded not when whole document is drawed? I am asking because I am setting text for label elements in document . ready(it could for 100 labels +-) and I worry that on slow PC it will be seen. PS for now lets say i have to set the labels like this...
[03:27:04] <shoky> Trudko it triggers when the DOM structure is ready, but before images finish loading and stuff.. setting 100 labels programattically on a slow PC/browser might be noticed, donno :P
[03:29:08] <shoky> if you're worried about it, do that shit serverside.
[03:35:52] <Trudko> shoky: ok
[03:36:10] <Trudko> thx
[03:36:11] <Christer_> Could anyone of you have a look at this problem : http://highslide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=18004 - Thanks :)
[03:38:57] <shoky> Christer_: you might mention that its HighCharts related..

[03:48:32] <BUCKY> HI Guy's
[03:48:39] <xec> HI BUCKY
[03:48:48] <BUCKY> xec: hi XEC
[03:52:00] <Trudko> shokz itt seems that I will have to use pure javascript , what I can do though is use getElementById and InnerHtml and not to use jquery at all
[03:52:26] <shoky> HI XEC
[03:52:31] <shoky> hm
[03:52:35] <xec> HI SHOKY
[03:53:24] <xec> Trudko: all you're doing is setting label content?
[03:53:25] <shoky> Trudko: yerp
[03:53:45] <BUCKY> xec: i want to upload a image using Jquery
[03:53:45] <Trudko> xec: yes
[03:54:09] <Trudko> xec its workaround around limitation of platform I am working on for multi language support
[03:54:20] <shoky> /DCC SEND xec me_nude_2008.jpg
[03:54:23] <shoky> er
[03:54:27] <xec> rofl
[03:54:37] <BUCKY> xec: ?
[03:54:44] <xec> did you mean me_nude_2008.jpg.exe ?
[03:54:51] <shoky> l0l0l0l i thought u wouldnt notice
[03:54:58] <shoky> u r savvy
[03:55:06] <xec> hehehe
[03:55:20] <xec> i would double click the sh*t out of that
[03:55:28] <shoky> ;]
[03:55:48] <xec> BUCKY: cool, what have you tried so far?
[03:55:52] <shoky> fackkk. ill go to work. BAI
[03:56:42] <xec> Trudko: i doubt jquery will be noticably slower than native js for that sort of thing, but if you don't need jquery, don't use it ;)
[03:57:32] <xec> Trudko: the thing that stumped me was "getElementById", if you got a lot of labels...
[03:58:00] <Trudko> why did it sumped you?
[03:58:12] <xec> because an ID means *one* element
[03:59:52] <Trudko> xec yes and  ? :) I will run it for each label
[04:04:02] <skylamer`> how can i append some "html" every four element of some parent?
[04:04:20] <skylamer`> $("*:gt(4)").append("html") ?
[04:04:41] <xec> :nth-child(4n)
[04:05:59] <skylamer`> ye
[04:06:04] <skylamer`> so to mix jquery with css, thnx
[04:06:28] <xec> the selectors in jquery is css, yes
[04:07:34] <skylamer`> parent > *:nth-child(4n) that's works
[04:07:43] <xec> no need for the star
[04:07:58] <xec> but yes, that should work
[04:08:19] <xec> if performance is an issue you should avoid the > though, use .children() instead
[04:08:30] <skylamer`> hmmm
[04:08:42] <skylamer`> but its appending in the inner of the element
[04:08:51] <skylamer`> how can i insert a new element between this and the next element?
[04:09:04] <xec> ?after
[04:09:04] <caniuse> xec: .after(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[04:09:26] <skylamer`> :D)
[04:09:40] <xec> skylamer`: http://jsfiddle.net/CTk3U/
[04:09:49] <xec> errr
[04:09:54] <xec> i used append, which is wrong
[04:09:55] <xec> lol
[04:10:08] <xec> but you get the point :) http://jsfiddle.net/CTk3U/1/
[04:11:15] <skylamer`> thank you
[04:15:12] <phryk> can anyone tell me what valid options for jquery-cycles' 'easing' option are?
[04:17:12] <xec> only two from core, "swing" and "linear" if i remember correctly
[04:17:27] <xec> but there are a lot more available in the easing plugin
[04:18:32] <xec> http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/easing.html
[04:19:06] <Cork> xec: if i remember correctly all the effects exist in core
[04:19:09] <phryk> xec: Thanks.
[04:19:14] <xec> oh really?
[04:19:28] <phryk> "The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called swing, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called linear."
[04:19:30] <Cork> they imported the complete easing plugin
[04:19:36] <phryk> Is what api.jquery.com/animate tells me
[04:20:18] <Cork> ah, wait it was imported into ui, not jquery
[04:33:10] <stenno> good day, am i correct that:   $(myarray).map(function(item) { console.log(item);}); is the same as $(myarray).map(function() { console.log(this);}); ?
[04:34:56] <stenno> seems
[04:35:24] <xec> yes
[04:37:36] <a|ex|alt> helloo
[04:37:47] <rethus> hi
[04:38:03] <stenno> how does that work: internally is it (this === arguments) ?
[04:38:42] <xec> what?
[04:39:23] <xec> no
[04:39:24] <stenno> i mean, how come that 'this' is the argument to the map function?
[04:39:55] <xec> stenno: it uses .call()
[04:39:57] <stenno> i would expect it to be either the function or the myarray
[04:39:58] <stenno> eh
[04:40:16] <xec> first argument of .call() becomes the this
[04:40:21] <xec> eh, so to speak
[04:40:33] <xec> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[04:41:03] <legoney> I have an $(object).mousemove(e) and i want to get the mouse position for the document, not that object. Is it possible to refer to $(document)s e.pageX and e.pageY?
[04:41:30] <legoney> I don't want a $(document).mousemove :)
[04:41:37] <a|ex|alt> I have a textarea and would like to set color tot green via jquery. I am trying to do so with following snip:   http://jsfiddle.net/eff77/ This doesnt work out, any idea why?
[04:41:37] <xec> stenno: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.7.2&fn=jQuery.fn.map
[04:42:23] <xec> stenno: internally it uses $.map() and .call() on the callback
[04:43:15] <legoney> a|ex|alt: Looks green to me? If it should load automatically you have to run it inside $(document).ready
[04:44:14] <stenno> xec, thanks, will look into thjis
[04:44:15] <stenno> this
[04:44:52] <pachet> legoney: mousemove events always give event.pageX and event.pageY relative to the document
[04:46:59] <a|ex|alt> legoney: I wrapped this in $(document).ready but it doesnt work for me
[04:47:18] <a|ex|alt> I thought "this" refers to the wrong obj
[04:48:45] <legoney> pachet: Doesn't seem like it. Read the jquery manual and top 10px is 10px from the top of the element the mouse is over
[04:49:11] <legoney> a|ex|alt: Try to skip the function part, only include $("#test").css("color", "green"); in ready
[04:49:58] <legoney> a|ex|alt: But it's kind of unneccessary to do it with jquery/js if it always should be green, better to do it with CSS
[04:50:43] <a|ex|alt> I know but I am trying to figure out to work with this
[04:50:53] <a|ex|alt> its just for testing
[04:51:06] <legoney> ok
[04:51:15] <a|ex|alt> in fact I am trying to get codemirror running on a textarea on my Drupal Site#
[04:51:33] <a|ex|alt> been trying for a while already ;)
[04:51:35] <ZUZ3L> hej
[04:51:53] <a|ex|alt> so I wanted to test some little things like that
[04:51:53] * ZUZ3L quits for today...
[04:52:04] <pachet> ZUZ3L: lol
[04:52:26] <a|ex|alt> so I'd like to avoid skipping the function part and solve it with "this"
[04:56:30] <legoney> pachet: Doesn't seem like it. Read the jquery manual and top 10px is 10px from the top of the element the mouse is over
[04:57:44] <pachet> legoney: event.pageX: The mouse position relative to the left edge of the document.
[04:57:49] <pachet> from http://api.jquery.com/event.pageX/
[04:57:53] <pachet> seems pretty clear to me
[04:58:34] <legoney> pachet: Heh it does. Sorry. But look at the demo...
[05:00:02] <pachet> legoney: its an iframe
[05:00:52] <legoney> pachet: Argh, it is! Why wouldn't they say so in the code above the demo
[05:01:38] <jeffsmykil> Sometimes I feel like the web is scry and moves too fast for me to keep up
[05:01:41] <legoney> pachet: Well I have a code where pageX and pageY is not where the mouse is. Have to figure out why
[05:01:43] <jeffsmykil> there I said it
[05:01:57] <legoney> jeffsmykil:  :D
[05:02:16] <jeffsmykil> I'm being serious
[05:02:29] <jeffsmykil> Canvas scares the shit out of me, seems so hard
[05:02:36] <pachet> its pretty easy
[05:02:56] <pachet> if you understand that the 0,0 origin coordinate is the top left corner of the canvas, you're golden
[05:03:06] <pachet> the rest is just turning pixels on and off
[05:03:08] <jeffsmykil> im not use to having to draw things in code
[05:03:09] <ZUZ3L> lol
[05:04:09] <hooloovoo> pachet: sometimes 0,0 is top left =P
[05:04:30] <ZUZ3L> I've been developing websites for over 12 years now, and I understand where you're from jeff... I feel some what the same about it....
[05:04:50] <ZUZ3L> But wasn't that the same when you first looked at jQuery?
[05:04:54] <ZUZ3L> It sure was for me... :9
[05:04:55] <ZUZ3L> :)
[05:05:02] <jeffsmykil> and then there is ember, which seems really neat, but I'm not an engineer, it seems like javascript is moving towards engineering lol
[05:05:25] <jeffsmykil> i need a more solid programming background
[05:05:27] <pachet> hooloovoo: isnt that what i said?
[05:05:35] <jeffsmykil> i feel like javascript cant be your first language anymore
[05:06:19] <hooloovoo> pachet: i understood it as 0,0 is always top left
[05:06:59] <jonocosa> jeffsmykil, yes webapp era lol
[05:07:37] <jeffsmykil> I liked when "engineers" hated and were afraid of javascript lol
[05:07:41] <legoney> jeffsmykil: The longer you have been programming the the smaller the stage to the "next level" seems. So new technologies are not very hard after a while, mostly its a releif
[05:07:51] <pachet> hooloovoo: oh i see
[05:08:14] <jeffsmykil> legoney: yeah that makes sense, but I'm stil not sure I will ever get used to drawing pictures in code
[05:08:38] <pachet> so yeah, to be thorough jeffsmykil, you can translate the grid offset -- maybe this is actually helping prove your point
[05:08:58] <legoney> jeffsmykil: Never tried it myself, seems like fun :) I think most people use a graphical editor and saves it to SVG
[05:09:16] <jeffsmykil> oh yeah I have been doing svg graphics in an editor for like 10 years
[05:09:21] <ximarin> hm, problem: I ahve a table and when I hover the rows, I highlight them. But some of the rows initially have another color and this color gets lost when I hover out (they get transparent). How can I let them keep the color they had before hovering?
[05:09:40] <pachet> ximarin: use classes
[05:09:49] <hooloovoo> jeffsmykil: it's not a drawing board. it's just one of all the things it can do.
[05:09:50] <jeffsmykil> pachet could he use toggle with classes?
[05:10:02] <jeffsmykil> hooloovoo: another valid point
[05:10:18] <hooloovoo> jeffsmykil: using it to manipulate images is great, and you don't have to know how to draw =)
[05:10:43] <pachet> jeffsmykil: yeah, it sounds like he's using inline styles on the elements with the preset color -- he should really be using classes so that its easier to negotiate the css precedence
[05:10:47] <pachet> ximarin:^
[05:11:00] <tocka> Is it possible to sum all the checked fields of the form? (im only having radios and checkboxes with numerical values)
[05:11:09] <tocka> and show the result as it changes?
[05:11:37] <pachet> of course
[05:12:16] <tocka> alright then, how to do for all the checked values of the form?
[05:12:20] <tocka> I know how to do it seperately
[05:12:25] <tocka> :/
[05:12:40] <jeffsmykil> I just wanted to voice my insecurities to a channel that might understand
[05:13:27] <Cork> tocka: var sum = 0; $('form :checked').each(function() { sum += parseInt($(this).val(), 10); });
[05:13:28] <legoney> pachet: I was just uploading my code for you to see, but there it worked :D ok, some container-thingy that messes things up
[05:15:11] <tocka> Cork thank you
[05:15:13] <jeffsmykil> I really want to go to this http://training.bocoup.com/html5-game-dev/
[05:18:08] <pachet> tocka: oh i thought you wanted to update them as they changed
[05:18:14] <pachet> var total, myInputs = $('input:radio input:checkbox').on('change.mynamespace', function(){total+=($(this).is(':checked'))?1:-1;}); total = myInputs.filter(':checked').length;
[05:19:43] <ximarin> pachet: ok, tried this in a fiddle and it works. So an added class takes precedence of an existing class if it alters an attribute both classes use?=?
[05:20:38] <pachet> its the order they appear in the browser's compiled css definition for the page
[05:21:27] <ximarin> oh, ok, so the last one called is the one used...
[05:21:51] <ximarin> thx :)
[05:24:20] <poppiez> any tips/tricks to speed up jquery animations?
[05:24:30] <poppiez> I'm animating the left value
[05:25:36] <johnkpaul> poppiez: speed up meaning the animations are jerky?
[05:25:50] <poppiez> johnkpaul: yes
[05:26:01] <poppiez> primarily in opera and <=IE8
[05:26:14] <johnkpaul> ah, I was going to tell you to switch to jquery transit, but they won't help those browsers
[05:27:03] <poppiez> johnkpaul: yeah, I'm using jquery animate as a fallback too. I've tried to set the $.fx.interval to 20; but still jerky
[05:27:22] <poppiez> IE8 is doing the animation quite well but the last 30 pixels are insanely fast
[05:27:27] <poppiez> almost like it "snaps" at the end
[05:27:44] <johnkpaul> poppiez: some of that is just because of how poor the setTimeout resolution is on older IEs
[05:28:19] <johnkpaul> it's funny, I still have this open in chrome from ajpiano sending it yesterday - http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2011/12/14/timer-resolution-in-browsers/
[05:28:56] <poppiez> will give that a read
[05:30:05] <pachet> its one of those areas where you quickly come to question how much effort is worth it
[05:30:08] <pachet> :[
[05:30:41] <johnkpaul> yeah, definitely not worth the time unless you're being paid per hour
[05:30:45] <Haprog> I'd just disable animations for older suckier browsers if they didn't work out that well.
[05:31:23] <Haprog> unless the whole point of the page is the animation
[05:32:08] <poppiez> Haprog: it's a slideshow so it's pretty fundamental. tough to learn that <=IE8 are pretty much doomed and nothing I can do. IE8 still has quite the market share
[05:32:43] <hooloovoo> poppiez: let people know it'll look like shit if they don't upgrade?
[05:33:14] <pachet> that argument will only take you up so many rungs of the corporate decision-ladder
[05:33:43] <mantas322> Hello
[05:33:45] <poppiez> I don't have anyone to answer to so it's my own decision, fortunately :)
[05:33:53] <poppiez> I just don't want to discriminate on browser
[05:34:13] <Hippie_> http://pastie.org/4031359
[05:34:31] <Hippie_> 'event is not defined'
[05:34:32] <thinkerbell> Hi, I was wondering, I have two commands. $("#DIV1").somePlugin(); $("#DIV2).somePlugin(); When I run the page, both the plugins start at the same time, Is it possible for my second command to run only after the first has completed?
[05:34:48] <mantas322> hey guys what can I do to reduce the size of of my buttons
[05:34:49] <mantas322> in IE
[05:34:57] <Hippie_> thinkerbell, callback function
[05:35:02] <mantas322> They stretch across the  the entire page
[05:35:12] <thinkerbell> Hippie_, exactly, how would I do that?
[05:35:13] <mantas322> in other browsers I can surround with div width
[05:35:18] <mantas322> however in IE it ignores that
[05:35:19] <ximarin> pachet: hmm, this does not work, can you eventually see why? http://jsfiddle.net/Twra6/4/
[05:35:23] <mantas322> anyone got any suggestions?
[05:35:30] <hooloovoo> poppiez: well there's nothing you can do about it. it's better to let them know what's wrong that having them think you're a bad programmer.
[05:35:33] <hooloovoo> =)
[05:35:45] <thinkerbell> Hippie_, I guess I have to look into the plugin and see if it supports callbacks eh?
[05:35:46] <Hippie_> thinkerbell, http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_callback.asp
[05:35:59] <johnkpaul> poppiez: http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/
[05:36:33] <Hippie_> thinkerbell, I think all animations have callbacks
[05:37:03] <pachet> ximarin: http://jsfiddle.net/9ksGP/
[05:37:07] <mantas322> How can I reduce the size of my button controls in jquery IE
[05:37:11] <pachet> ^ just switch the order they appear in your stylesheet
[05:37:32] <ximarin> erm, wtf
[05:37:37] <Anticom> hi all
[05:37:38] <ximarin> not funny anymore -.-
[05:37:48] <pachet> ximarin: ?
[05:37:49] <Anticom> is there a way to register a keyup event when the page is still loading?
[05:38:08] <gianbalex> ThiefMaster`, try this: $("div1").hide(); $("#div1").show(0,function(){ $("#div2").show() })
[05:38:09] <Anticom> i want to toggle a simple scroll-function for a page where content is flushing from the server constantly
[05:38:15] <thinkerbell> Hippie_, hmm, but in my case, I am using a plugin
[05:38:16] <gianbalex> thinkerbell, * sorry
[05:38:35] <ximarin> that it still depends on the order in a textfile is ridiculous...
[05:38:42] <pachet> its not a textfile
[05:38:53] <gianbalex> but if you use a plugin, check if your plugin have callback
[05:38:54] <Hippie_> thinkerbell, what plugin are you using?
[05:39:00] <johnkpaul> Anticom: scroll on the window? I think that you can add that pre-domready, have you tried it?
[05:39:00] <pachet> its a css ruleset that is added to the page's definition
[05:39:16] <Anticom> johnkpaul never heard of it tbh
[05:39:20] <pachet> and there's a very established order of precedence with regard to class-based style instructions
[05:39:27] <Anticom> johnkpaul any reference?
[05:39:27] <thinkerbell> https://github.com/dmrschmidt/jquery-typewriter
[05:39:28] <johnkpaul> ?scroll @ Anticom
[05:39:28] <caniuse> Anticom: .scroll(): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[05:39:39] <Anticom> no i have a scroll function already
[05:39:50] <Anticom> problem is registering the keyup event before document has loaded
[05:39:54] <poppiez> hooloovoo: johnkpaul: don't get me wrong. I'm all about graceful degradation and doing so right now. I just don't like having to _inform_ the user about using a terrible browser and suggesting other ones. I'd be annoyed at this myself
[05:40:11] <Anticom> because it takes like 5 minutes to load everything... i want to be able to toggle that scrolling on a key event
[05:40:29] <thinkerbell> http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/jquery-grab-bag/text-effects.html
[05:40:40] <johnkpaul> oh I see Anticom, the keyup event on the document should still work
[05:40:41] <ximarin> pachet: ok, accepted :D but still thx for your help!
[05:40:42] <Zhy> I'm using the validate plugin http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ and redirecting to a php function via this {validate:{remote:'/users/ajax_validate'}} , now my problem is, how can I use what my function returns to determine what to display (success/error/etc) ?
[05:41:14] <Anticom> johnkpaul $('document').keyup(...); ??
[05:41:35] <Anticom> oh without quotes around document*
[05:41:52] <Xotix> Zhy probably you have a callback and the stuff echoed by your php script is available within this callback. never used validate but read teh docs for a callback func
[05:42:24] <Hippie_> thinkerbell, doesn't have a callback
[05:42:39] <hooloovoo> poppiez: ok, so let them have slow animations and no idea why =D
[05:42:44] <johnkpaul> Anticom: did you try that?
[05:42:54] <johnkpaul> $(document).on('keyup', func) as well Anticom
[05:43:34] <Zhy> Thank you Xotix , just looked again at the documenation and noticed I had overlooked all the options and callbacks :O :D
[05:43:50] <codecab> $(window).height() under FF returns the body height instead of the iframes viewport height... any idea why?
[05:43:56] <gianbalex> thinkerbell,
[05:44:15] <gianbalex> you need to set "callback" object
[05:44:20] <Anticom> johnkpaul like so? http://jsfiddle.net/8U8va/3/
[05:44:23] <gianbalex> read this https://github.com/chadselph/jquery-typewriter
[05:44:42] <gianbalex> scroll bottom of page and read the README
[05:44:46] <Anticom> johnkpaul doesn't work that way :/
[05:45:00] <thinkerbell> Hippie_, hmm, thanks for looking
[05:45:02] <Anticom> problem is that i can't register the event unless document has finished loading
[05:45:07] <thinkerbell> gianbalex, thx
[05:45:09] <Xotix> zhy np echo a json. e.g. json_encode($array) and parse it with jquery back to an obj.
[05:45:51] <thinkerbell> Hippie_, gianbalex found the callback
[05:46:24] <Zhy> Ok I will try that, thanks again Xotix
[05:46:25] <gianbalex> thinkerbell, you use this: https://github.com/dmrschmidt/jquery-typewriter
[05:46:35] <gianbalex> try https://github.com/chadselph/jquery-typewriter
[05:46:44] <johnkpaul> Anticom: hmm, I don't know enough about how this works to help significantly, but I'd assume that there is a way to add events before the dom is completely loaded because you _can_ put script tags inside the body after html
[05:46:47] <gianbalex> it's same plugin but with callback support :)
[05:50:32] <thinkerbell> Hippie_, oops, no, it was a different plugin, one that has call back support.
[05:50:45] <thinkerbell> gianbalex, thx, actually that download link is broken
[05:52:21] <gianbalex> thinkerbell, save html page of this: https://raw.github.com/chadselph/jquery-typewriter/master/jquerytypewriter.js
[05:54:07] <thinkerbell> gianbalex, oh sweet, thx
[05:54:30] <gianbalex> thinkerbell,  ;)
[05:54:32] <RonaldoMcDonald> Does anyone know how I can makes settings adjustments to jscrollpane after initialization?
[05:55:03] <Funkt> Hi there I'm using a local scroll script that moves to an anchor id on the page when a button is pressed, The problem I have is when I make any button to open a new window the localscroll seems to kick in and roll the page down by about 20px everytime and I cant seem to see why?
[05:55:25] <Funkt> anyone know of or know of a work round this?
[05:55:40] <codecab> $(window).height() returns different values for IE and FF when used inside of an iframe. FF fails in getting the actual viewport height and returns the body height instead.. why? am i doing something wrong?
[05:56:32] <gianbalex> codecab, no, its' correct, but IE and FF return dirrefferent response
[05:56:41] <gianbalex> like: AUTO
[05:57:02] <gianbalex> try $(document).width()
[05:57:27] <gianbalex> after $(document).ready
[05:58:11] <thinkerbell> gianbalex, the callback functionality isn't working I'm finding.  I wrote:  $("#atyper1").typewrite({  	'callback':  $("#atyper2").typewrite()  }); And well, it doesn't wait for the first command to complete
[05:58:11] <codecab> .width() aint the problem. .height() isnt working as expected
[05:58:44] <truk77> I need a recipe to pop up a floating div that I can put a brief status message into (e.g. "data saved").  Can anybody point me to something I might use for that?
[05:58:48] <xec> thinkerbell: callback should be a function
[05:58:58] <thinkerbell> xec, oh yeah, thx
[05:59:23] <gianbalex> thinced, you need to set callbacl: function(){ $("#atyper2").typewrite()}
[05:59:31] <gianbalex> thinkerbell, sorry ( again )
[05:59:48] <thinkerbell> gianbalex, thx
[05:59:57] <gianbalex> :)
[06:00:20] <gianbalex> codecab, what return height?
[06:01:05] <Hippie_> gianbalex are you a genious?
[06:01:11] <gianbalex> and then, you call .height() funcion after the page loading?
[06:01:34] <gianbalex> Hippie_, no, i think lol
[06:01:43] <Hippie_> dam :/
[06:01:50] <tocka> Wanted to ask, why doesnt it update the div info live?

[06:22:20] <gianbalex> tocka, nope, mom
[06:22:30] <xec> and if you only supply the id $("#textareaid") jquery will internally use the more performant getElementById
[06:23:11] <tocka> ?
[06:23:50] <a|ex|G> so smth like this? var $textarea = $(getElementByID('#edit-edit'));
[06:24:15] <gianbalex> tocka, http://pastebin.com/xu1ZbpMA
[06:24:39] <gianbalex> a|ex|G, what? :\
[06:24:55] <a|ex|G> not?
[06:25:20] <gianbalex> var $textarea = document.getElementById("#edit-edit")
[06:25:25] <a|ex|G> oh
[06:25:27] <gianbalex> if you don't want jquery object
[06:25:40] <tocka> gianbalex still its the same :) page loads, it shows the total number but if I check more options the numbers doesnt change
[06:25:42] <xec> you'd need to lose the # as well
[06:26:01] <gianbalex> sorry no # before edit-edit
[06:26:03] <xec> a|ex|G: what i wrote is sufficient. you know css selectors?
[06:26:06] <gianbalex> xec, riith
[06:26:08] <gianbalex> right*
[06:26:54] <a|ex|G> xec: u mean IDs classes and tags?
[06:27:03] <a|ex|G> kinda
[06:27:13] <xec> a|ex|G: ".classname" will select all elements with class "classname" and "#someId" will select the element with ID "someId"
[06:27:17] <a|ex|G> I know CSS but in a simpler way
[06:27:31] <a|ex|G> in that drupal its all bit confusing
[06:27:38] <xec> a|ex|G: so $("#someId") will select the element with ID "someId"
[06:27:57] <a|ex|G> ok
[06:28:00] <gianbalex> tocka, you need $("form checkbox :checked").each()
[06:28:10] * SleepyPikachu is sleepy
[06:28:34] <tocka> it doesnt matter, as I have :checked
[06:28:38] <gianbalex> and you need to add: $("form checkbox").click(function(){})
[06:28:40] <xec> a|ex|G: an ID is a unique identifier, which is why you don't need to do $("textara#id") when $("#id") does the same, but quicker
[06:28:46] <gianbalex> to update your sum everytim
[06:29:15] <a|ex|G> kk
[06:30:03] <a|ex|G> I think I already tried with all the IDs and classes I dont know how lont been sittin here with that one particular problem
[06:30:35] <gianbalex> tocka, try this http://pastebin.com/fF5A6mbw
[06:30:41] <a|ex|G> seems to be a long process for me
[06:30:55] <a|ex|G> k I am trying out ur topps
[06:30:56] <a|ex|G> tipps
[06:32:30] <xec> a|ex|G: i haven't really been following the discussion, only commented on the $("textarea#textareaid") thing, what exactly are you doing?
[06:32:53] <gianbalex> sorry tocka it's wrong, this is correct code: http://pastebin.com/ZcFLdsWB
[06:33:20] <a|ex|G> trying to get codemirror working with my form
[06:33:56] <a|ex|G> drupal site, own module with a form textarea... and I simply would like to replace that textarea with the codemirror in xml mode
[06:34:24] <a|ex|G> and I am struggling with that since yest morning :(
[06:34:36] <xec> ouch
[06:34:53] <xec> CMSes can be a b*tch =(
[06:34:54] <a|ex|G> ye thats how I am feeling ;)
[06:35:00] <a|ex|G> ye so true
[06:35:08] <xec> i'm struggling with my own at the moment so i feel you
[06:35:13] <a|ex|G> hehe
[06:35:27] <a|ex|G> thanks god I am not alone ;)
[06:39:07] <a|ex|G> gianbalex: what do u mean if I dont want jquery obj with var $textarea = document.getElementById("edit-edit")??
[06:39:41] <a|ex|G> I guess I need it as jquery obj
[06:40:08] <gianbalex> $textarea = jQuery("#id")      save entire jQuery("#id") object into $textarea. Now if you call $textarea.text()  is give text into textarea
[06:40:38] <gianbalex> $textarea = document.getElementById("id")  get che DOM object.
[06:40:49] <a|ex|G> ah ok
[06:40:56] <gianbalex> :)
[06:42:03] <a|ex|G> oooh myy good
[06:42:05] <a|ex|G> ness
[06:42:09] <a|ex|G> thats it
[06:42:27] <RonaldoMcDonald> Does anyone know how I can makes settings adjustments to jscrollpane after initialization?
[06:42:28] <a|ex|G> first time I cann see that damn code highlight in my form
[06:42:35] <a|ex|G> thanks a lot
[06:42:44] <gianbalex> a|ex|G, YEAAAAAAAH :9

[07:13:07] <rufsketch1> so ummm. . . how do I internet explorer?
[07:13:17] <rufsketch1> Or, more specifically
[07:13:35] <rufsketch1> What does "Unexpected call to method or property access." mean?
[07:14:04] <xec> have you tried double clicking the big blue "E"?
[07:14:05] <rufsketch1> If I understand the error reporting syntax correctly, it ays the problem is in line 3 odjquery-1.7.2.min.js
[07:14:22] <rufsketch1> xec: Yeah. I managed that so far. It was mostly trial and error though.
[07:14:34] <rufsketch1> ays = says
[07:14:51] <rufsketch1> odjquery = of jquery
[07:14:55] <rufsketch1> god I need sleep.
[07:15:04] <xec> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide4
[07:15:07] <johnkpaul> rufsketch1: switch to the unminified jquery, or else you have pretty much no hope of debugging this
[07:15:35] <rufsketch1> johnkpaul: so I'm reading the error correctly then? It does indeed think it's happening within the jquery file?
[07:16:17] <xec> rufsketch1: garbage in, garbage out - most likely some jquery method is used incorrectly (invalid input perhaps)
[07:16:25] <johnkpaul> rufsketch1: yes, you are reading the error correctly, but that doesn't mean that jQuery itself is the problem
[07:16:46] <rufsketch1> johnkpaul: right. Alright, hang on. Switching over.
[07:17:07] <johnkpaul> switch to the uminified jquery, use the js debugger to put a breakpoint wherever that is, and poke around
[07:19:31] <rufsketch1> wow, that's a hell of a compression ratio
[07:19:40] <rufsketch1> We just jumped from line 3 to line 5847.
[07:20:32] <rufsketch1> johnkpaul: it seems that the error occurs on this line this.appendChild( elem );
[07:21:07] <johnkpaul> ok rufsketch1, so what is the value of this at that time?
[07:21:16] <johnkpaul> also, look up the callstack and see where your code is calling into jquery
[07:21:37] <rufsketch1> johnkpaul: what does one use for IE js debugging?
[07:22:00] <johnkpaul> did you read xec's link?
[07:22:12] <johnkpaul> what version of IE? IE8+ has built in debuggers
[07:22:48] <rufsketch1> IE8. Just found the debugger. Should I still read xec's link?
[07:23:12] <johnkpaul> rufsketch1: :) you ask that as if it would take you a very long time to make that decision yourself
[07:23:29] <johnkpaul> you should read xec's link anyway, it is a good resource to understand how to debug jquery
[07:24:10] <rufsketch1> johnkpaul: right. Let me rephrase. I am in a ridiculous rush to get this working. Is xec's link going to save me time debugging this or should I wait until after?
[07:24:22] <xec> rufsketch1: it will save you time
[07:24:43] <rufsketch1> xec: alright.
[07:24:45] <xec> rufsketch1: unless you're already familiar with the debugging tools
[07:24:52] <rufsketch1> barely. So okay.
[07:25:11] <Guest36031> hi folks, i've been away from coding now, like 3 years :P How much has jquery grown these past years?
[07:25:35] <johnkpaul> Guest36031: http://www.onato.com/2010/02/jquery-size-over-time-with-the-google-visualization-api/ ;P
[07:26:25] <johnkpaul> actually, that's only till 2010, Guest36031 http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size
[07:26:56] <RonaldoMcDonald> Could someone recommend me a scrollbar replacement script other than jscrollpane?
[07:26:58] <Guest36031> hang on;D gt change browser.. this IE is killing me
[07:29:43] <Guest36031> haha you really took that "grown" part literally johnkpaul ;)
[07:30:26] <johnkpaul> Guest36031: yes, that's why the ;P
[07:30:33] <johnkpaul> if you really want to learn the major developments, just google for jquery release notes
[07:30:37] <johnkpaul> and check out the 1.7 and 1.6 release notes
[07:30:46] <johnkpaul> they'll give a run down of the big changes and additions
[07:32:37] <rufsketch1> oh god
[07:32:42] <rufsketch1> the IE debugger
[07:32:44] <rufsketch1> oh god
[07:33:00] <rufsketch1> after every step IE freezes for 5 seconds
[07:36:51] <SonicX> hey... how to access a heading element which is before a div with class x ?
[07:40:18] <rufsketch1> SonicX: clarify?
[07:42:58] <SonicX> rufsketch1:  i have <h1>some text <h1> <table>data</table> now my "this" object  is table and i want to access the text inside h1 element .
[07:45:10] <xec> ?prev @ SonicX
[07:45:10] <bot-t> SonicX, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[07:45:49] <SonicX> xec : thanks :)
[07:46:35] <rufsketch1> $(this).parent().find(h1)?
[07:47:46] <xec> it's not a parent, .prev() will do the job, assuming it is indeed the previous sibling
[07:48:05] <SonicX> wont that return all the h1 's in the dom ? i need only the prev one .. i think prev will work
[07:48:08] <xec> unless you want all headers that are siblings
[07:48:16] <xec> or descendants of siblings
[07:59:28] <tocka> How can I show 2 digits after the dot?
[07:59:35] <tocka> or how to convert 0.4 to 40?

[08:00:11] <xec> *100`
[08:00:14] <xec> ?*
[08:00:16] <xec> right :p
[08:01:58] <xec> whose bot is caniuse?

[08:03:58] <murr4y> i've specified an ajax 'beforeSend' function. can i add another beforeSend function for another specific ajax call without removing the first one?
[08:05:42] <murr4y> (the first was specified with ajaxOptions)
[08:05:50] <murr4y> ajaxSetup*
[08:06:02] <xec> murr4y: you can add multiple listeners iirc
[08:06:40] <murr4y> aha, well it did not call the first listener when i attempted this
[08:07:16] <xec> hold on
[08:07:22] <xec> http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events
[08:07:34] <xec> looks like the beforeSend is local event
[08:08:25] <murr4y> aha, i need to use the global one, ajaxSend?
[08:08:25] <xec> and if i understand the docs correctly that means 1 per ajax call, as it is defined as an option
[08:08:37] <murr4y> yeah, i see
[08:08:57] <rvsjoen_> anyone aware of any plugins that creates multi-level select lists ?
[08:09:10] <murr4y> xec: you're probably right, i'll try it out. thanks a bunch!
[08:09:16] <rvsjoen_> or cascading selects, or whatever the frick they're called

[08:12:43] <LordThumper> The response has the header Content-Type: text/html

[08:36:28] <endberg> hi everyone
[08:36:33] <Famic> is there a good reference for nested accordion menus ?
[08:41:34] <batdorf> someone want to help me with a sorting problem?
[08:43:42] <kryl> hi
[08:44:22] <batdorf> i have four divs in a row, if someone clicks on one of the divs, i want that div to magically become the second in the row, meanwhile keeping the order of the divs. So for example, {1, 2, 3, 4] and someone clicks on 3, it will become {2, 3, 4, 1}
[08:46:19] <endberg> I'd like to know, how to insert just a div opener tag (<div>) to the begining of an element (like a specific div, or a paragraph).  I tried  .prepend, but it automatically closes the div. : http://jsfiddle.net/BuTKW/3/
[08:47:03] <NoiseEee> endberg: you don't insert just an opener tag.  you insert a complete element
[08:47:09] <Famic> endberg: you can't insert invalid markup in the DOM
[08:47:15] <NoiseEee> endberg: if you need, compose the element before appending it
[08:48:05] <endberg> I see my error now, so I have to create a string variable first, with all the markup, then insert it into the div. Thanks for helping!
[08:48:18] <BillCriswell> endberg: It sounds like you're on the trail of needing "wrap
[08:52:39] <Synthesetic> can anyone take a look at this and tell me why its calling the same exact data in each call of this function?
[08:52:40] <Synthesetic> http://www.ohiopylecabinrentals.com/rental-properties/
[08:52:51] <Synthesetic> each of those should be a different property
[08:54:33] <Synthesetic> oh, because I'm an idiot, thats why
[09:01:55] <tocka> Synthesetic
[09:01:56] <tocka> lol
[09:01:57] <tocka> :D

[09:08:36] <beta0x64> Hey, I am trying to clear a textarea with .val, .text, .html anything really. If I populate it with JS, it clears just fine. If I type into it, then try to clear it, it sticks. Everything else changes though. Any ideas?
[09:09:16] <beta0x64> I have just never had inexplicable problems with jQuery like this.
[09:10:12] <skylamer`> fiddle ?
[09:10:17] <BillCriswell> beta0x64: Can we get some example code?
[09:10:30] <beta0x64> Hmm, let me try to reproduce it in JS fiddle
[09:12:15] <endberg> My whole problem comes from this: I have to columnize a div (which contains paragraphs) to display multicolumn newspaper style, widhtin a specific height window. My idea was this: I traverse the p-s with the each.method, measure their height, and if the paragraphs height is bigger than the windows height, I start a new div.
[09:13:07] <kryl> Please, how to test if the return of AJAX jquery post is in json datatype or in other format ? my remote script can return 2 different type ...
[09:15:17] <skylamer`> kryl idk may be you can get the dataType from the request somewhere
[09:15:51] <beta0x64> http://jsfiddle.net/p532y/ it's kinda like this, but the fiddle works :(
[09:19:09] <globe_tmp> hi guys
[09:19:56] <kryl> skylamer`, not sure to handle what u want to mean
[09:19:59] <globe_tmp> guys any help plz with this http://pastie.org/4032547
[09:20:09] <globe_tmp> after i try to setup he cookie
[09:20:14] <globe_tmp> it return to me null
[09:21:18] <beta0x64> BillCriswell: This is really strange. :( It works in jsFiddle just fine.
[09:21:41] <BillCriswell> beta0x64: A fiddle is good for a sanity check.
[09:21:53] <beta0x64> BillCriswell: what's really confusing is that if I alert the value of the textarea after clearing it, it's empty.
[09:22:01] <beta0x64> but it's still there . . .
[09:23:19] <BillCriswell> Are you using .val() for all input?
[09:23:38] <globe_tmp> anything wrong with my code ?
[09:23:44] <beta0x64> BillCriswell: I am using text() for textarea
[09:24:45] <BillCriswell> beta0x64: I think .val() is set to handle all the textarea stuff properly. The element keeps the initial value in it somewhere for things like a "reset" event.
[09:25:49] <BillCriswell> Which I think is what the alert gets.
[09:25:49] <beta0x64> BillCriswell: replacing all of it with val seems to work. Thank you! what a head-scratcher
[09:26:37] <endberg> Can I do something like this? There are for example 6 <p> in a div, and I like to wrap a container around the first 3 and another around the second 3.
[09:26:39] <BillCriswell> beta0x64: Oh, it'll get ya.
[09:29:40] <`poo> endberg: var els = $('div p'); els.slice(0,3).wrapAll('<div />'); els.slice(3,6).wrapAll('<div />');
[09:30:19] <globe_tmp> any cookie lover around here :d ?
[09:30:24] <globe_tmp> jquery cookies :d
[09:31:46] <endberg> poo thanks thats what Im looking for!

[10:01:44] <Funkt> Hi there im using jquery localscroll on a page & the page scrolls by setting id anchor points which Is fine, the problem I am having is when I create a link to an image for example to open something like a lightbox which has no id anchor point and it seems to scroll the page by 20px or so does anyone know of a fix for this or why it may be happening?
[10:01:52] <drojas> the problem is that inside the post method the $(this) method returns an unexpected object.. I can't figure out what is it
[10:02:17] <ngharo> drojas: console.log() it and you'll see what it is
[10:02:49] <ngharo> Funkt: not familiar with that plugin, perhaps a demo would help
[10:02:56] <drojas> I guess $(this).attr('class') should return the classes of the object triggering the post but it is not
[10:04:14] <Funkt> ngharo: http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[10:05:08] <ngharo> i meant a demo of your problem :)
[10:05:13] <ngharo> ?demo @ Funkt
[10:05:14] <bot-t> Funkt, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:05:21] <Funkt> Oh I see........
[10:05:32] <Funkt> thatll take some time
[10:05:39] <Funkt> I'll have to get back to you
[10:05:44] <Funkt> thanks all the same!
[10:09:40] <steveoh> anyone know if jquery ui 1.8.20 will be hosted on google cdn in the near future?
[10:17:31] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all. could someone look at this and tell me if I am on the right track or not: http://jsfiddle.net/7cxtp/5/
[10:18:21] <Whirl3d> I realize that I am configuring 3 elements in very much the same way, but I can't quite abstract it enough to configure each element in a factory pattern...

[10:20:01] <Whirl3d> woops forgot to load the images all together.
[10:22:51] <Whirl3d> I'll check back in a while if anyone gets a chance/feels inclined to comment. Thanks in advance for any help/support.
[10:24:59] <batdorf> Is there a good way to use a .shift() function on a jquery "array"?
[10:26:40] <_trev> Define "good way". :)
[10:27:57] <endberg> hi
[10:28:07] <endberg> Im making a script for a Samsung Smart Tv, That tv's browser allows cross domain ajax requests. Is there a way to tell the jquery to allow it too? (I know that I can work around the problem with various methods, but it will be simple if I could switch on the cross domain ajax on)
[10:29:23] <batdorf> good way = any way ;-)
[10:33:16] <ezakimak> endberg, jsonp?
[10:34:51] <endberg> I know, I can work around the problem with jsonp, but if I can "switch" jquery to allow it anyway, it would be easyer (in earlier versions, If I remember correctly, there was a switch for that)
[10:35:13] <johnkpaul> endberg: if the server supports it, and the browser supports it, there's nothing that jquery needs to do to make it work
[10:36:07] <endberg> I'll try then. Thanks.
[10:36:08] <ezakimak> anyone here know how to get a wijinputmask to load from a knockout data-bind attribute?
[10:36:14] <endberg> bye
[10:36:42] <_trev> batdorf, I don't think there is any shift method, but you could use filter and filter off the first index
[10:37:33] <johnkpaul> ?toArray @ batdorf _trev
[10:38:05] <johnkpaul> batdorf: _trev you can use $jqObj.toArray().shift()
[10:38:11] <_trev> johnkpaul, that woul dbe another functional option
[10:38:40] <batdorf> ill try it out
[10:43:15] <_trev> batdorf, http://jsfiddle.net/7CzP5/ - example of a jquery plugin for shift
[10:43:38] <_trev> batdorf, recogonize that it doesn't return the shifted item...
[10:44:14] <_trev> so i suppose that's crap haha
[10:44:59] <batdorf> ha ha
[10:45:29] <batdorf> heres what im trying to do in case you see a better way
[10:45:31] <batdorf> i have four divs in a row, if someone clicks on one of the divs, i want that div to magically become the second in the row, meanwhile keeping the order of the divs. So for example, {1, 2, 3, 4] and someone clicks on 3, it will become {2, 3, 4, 1}
[10:46:44] <_trev> I do like magic.
[10:47:24] <batdorf> jQuery can't easily do magic though, so i must use slight of hand instead
[10:48:07] <BinaryKitten> ah
[10:48:22] <batdorf> it seems pretty simple, filter through each div shifting each one until you reach one before the clicked div
[10:48:29] <BinaryKitten> so you want it to not magically cecome
[10:48:49] <BinaryKitten> become would end up 1,3,4,2
[10:48:57] <_trev> Aye
[10:50:14] <_trev> $li.click ( function () { $(this).before( $(this).prev()); } ); ???
[10:50:48] <_trev> or div...
[10:50:53] <BinaryKitten> while (indexcheck = 1 /* 0 based indexes */) { var item = $(this); item.insertBefore(item.prev(dev));}
[10:51:28] <BinaryKitten> don't actually use that code
[10:51:36] <BinaryKitten> it's only pseudo idea code
[10:52:57] <batdorf> yeah
[10:53:02] <batdorf> hmmm
[10:53:49] <batdorf> maybe i can combine detach and appendto
[10:55:40] <johnkpaul> _trev: batdorf http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/7CzP5/1/
[10:56:16] <johnkpaul> I just got really distracted by figuring out how to actually implement shift, but jQuery's public API doens't have any way to modify a jqobj in place
[10:56:18] <BinaryKitten> batdorf nope you won't be able to
[10:56:59] <BinaryKitten> batdorf if you were just moving that itme it would be fine
[10:57:08] <BinaryKitten> it's the moving of the other items that becomes the problem
[10:57:46] <_trev> Yeah, that's why I suggested filter.
[10:57:55] <_trev> But it's not quite the same as it doesn't return the object.
[10:58:14] <johnkpaul> well, if you want to keep the same semantics as Array.prototype.shift, it's necessary
[10:58:36] <_trev> Right.
[10:58:54] <johnkpaul> I don't know how much that really matters, my solution works, it's just breaking a layer or two of encapsulation
[10:59:53] <procrastubator>    $(".ContactFade").hover(function(){$(this).fadeOut(100);$(this).fadeIn(500);});  would this line affect everything that inherits the .ContactFade class?
[11:06:03] <johnkpaul> procrastubator: what do you mean by "inherits"? it will only affect the elements that have the class .ContactFade, not the descendants of such elemtns
[11:07:18] <BinaryKitten> batdorf i'm working on this lil problem
[11:07:19] <BinaryKitten> :)
[11:07:24] <batdorf> thanks johnkpaul , BinaryKitten , and _trev
[11:07:26] <BinaryKitten> about 50% the way through
[11:07:26] <Whirl3d> why can't you just $("elementclicked").after("elementclass:first"); jqobj=$("elementclass");
[11:07:56] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d not just moving 1 element
[11:08:08] <Whirl3d> won't the jquery object refresh with the correct dom order?
[11:08:27] <batdorf> btw, is there a way to break from .each() based on a condition?
[11:08:31] <Whirl3d> In other words, caching the jqobject before hand won't work, but recaching it after moving?
[11:16:22] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/8haEG/3/
[11:17:13] <Whirl3d> Here is some weird behavior....why is it that if you click on the first element, it drops one element? And why isn't jquery selecting them in dom order?
[11:22:43] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/8haEG/6/
[11:22:43] <stilist> what's the trick to make .on actually replicate the functionality of .live? as far as I can tell it doesn't, at all
[11:23:01] <Whirl3d> .live is just .on at the document level
[11:23:31] <Whirl3d> whereas it's much more efficient to use .on on the immediate parent of the elements you wish to manage
[11:23:52] <stilist> well, what I'm trying to do is something like $(".foo").on("click", blah)
[11:24:05] <Whirl3d> okay
[11:24:08] <stilist> but have it work even if I kill the existing .foo and replace it
[11:24:29] <stilist> if I have to go up a level I guess that works, but it seems kinda lousy
[11:24:31] <Whirl3d> so $(".foo").parent().on("click", ".foo", blah);
[11:24:51] <stilist> hm, okay
[11:24:55] <Whirl3d> then no matter how many .foo you add/replace etc. it will work
[11:25:38] <stilist> probably worth noting that in the docs, since .on makes no mention
[11:25:50] <stilist> and the closest I'm seeing on .live is binding to document
[11:26:54] <Whirl3d> right, which depending on the complexity of your document, could have to sort through hundreds of elements to filer the one that needs a click handler...
[11:27:40] <stilist> yeah, I'm not gonna go that route
[11:27:51] <stilist> parent-delegate it is
[11:27:52] <BinaryKitten> batdorf  - http://jsfiddle.net/7CzP5/3/
[11:28:38] <batdorf> bingo
[11:28:42] <batdorf> :)
[11:29:19] <stilist> thanks for the help, whirl3d!
[11:29:33] <batdorf> will this work if i have 10 divs?
[11:29:37] <BinaryKitten> urm nope
[11:29:46] <BinaryKitten> only works for 4
[11:29:58] <BinaryKitten> but you could expand on the concept
[11:30:17] <batdorf> yeah
[11:30:18] <BinaryKitten> let me change it slightly
[11:30:19] <batdorf> ill do that
[11:30:21] <batdorf> thanks
[11:32:00] <procrastubator> Hmm... so a li has the class "ContactFade" but this doesn't seem to do antyhing:    $(".ContactFade").hover(function(){$(this).fadeOut(500);function(){$(this).text("New Text");}});
[11:32:14] <procrastubator> Even though it fades without the second function?
[11:32:22] <procrastubator> Is that an incorrect way of changing text?
[11:33:03] <RonaldoMcDonald> I've noticed a few times that when i cache a jquery instance in a variable, that sometimes later on when I use it, it doesn't work. Anyone know why this may be?
[11:33:29] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/8haEG/8/
[11:33:57] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, isn't this the same?
[11:34:00] <Whirl3d> ^^
[11:34:52] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d pretty much where i was heading next
[11:35:18] <BinaryKitten> the only difference is that i'm trying to fiigure out how to move item 0 with the same code
[11:35:37] <Whirl3d> ah, I see the problem. Thanks.
[11:36:59] <Whirl3d> %
[11:39:48] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/8haEG/15/
[11:40:06] <Whirl3d> works now. I forgot to use %
[11:41:35] <Whirl3d> procrastubator, in your hover command, you don't terminate your mouseenter and mouseleave functions correctly.
[11:43:58] <RonaldoMcDonald> I've noticed a few times that when i cache a jquery instance in a variable, that sometimes later on when I use it, it doesn't work. Anyone know why this may be?
[11:44:24] <chustar> hello?
[11:44:29] <Whirl3d> RonaldoMcDonald, without seeing your implementation, it's hard to tell.
[11:44:38] <Whirl3d> hello chustar
[11:45:07] <chustar> i have a possible bug, just wanted to check if it was valid or not
[11:45:25] <Whirl3d> setup a test case on jsfiddle and pos the link here
[11:45:31] <chustar> irc.freenode.net
[11:45:45] <chustar> ah, i mean
[11:45:45] <chustar> http://jsfiddle.net/9vdAk/
[11:46:13] <RonaldoMcDonald> Whirl3d, it's a bit complicated and I regret that I don't have the time to whip up an example on jsfiddle at the moment.. was hoping someone may had this issue and could offer quick advice. Perhaps a little later!
[11:46:47] <chustar> i call toggle on the inner div, it should be set to be invisible. Then when the outer div is shown, the inner one should stay invisible, I think
[11:46:50] <Whirl3d> sounds good. I have had the same issue, it's just that it was complicated as well.
[11:48:08] <sunbeam> is there a proper way to detect whether the user visiting my site uses a mobile (ipad, android, ios, iphone) device?
[11:49:11] <Whirl3d> chustar, I don't think toggle works in this case because the element is no longer in the dom when it's parent is set to display:"none"
[11:49:13] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/9vdAk/4/
[11:49:31] <Whirl3d> by setting opacity of .outer to 0 it works the way you intended.
[11:50:40] <chustar> thanks whirl3d
[11:50:48] <Whirl3d> np
[11:51:41] <chustar> whirl3d, sortof weird that hide would work though
[11:51:42] <chustar> http://jsfiddle.net/DQ3aA/
[11:52:11] <Whirl3d> true...
[12:00:26] <dipser> how do i get all attribute values as text of one element?
[12:01:09] <_trev> $("element").attr("type" )
[12:01:25] <dipser> without the type ^^
[12:02:21] <dipser> i need something like $('*[*=:contains(xyz)]')
[12:03:24] <johnkpaul> dipser: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Node.attributes
[12:03:25] <explodes> is jquery 1.7.2 backwards compatible with 1.6 ?
[12:03:27] <johnkpaul> I don't know the browser support
[12:04:52] <dipser> thanks
[12:06:42] <procrastubator> Guys I rewrote some code and tried to turn it into a function, however it doesn't seem to work when in function format. Any input with this: http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:06:55] <procrastubator> I mean this* http://jsfiddle.net/JPRWj/
[12:06:59] <procrastubator> lol sorry
[12:09:51] <Whirl3d> procrastubator, are you using console to view errors and such?
[12:11:35] * shoky burps
[12:12:00] <Whirl3d> pizza for lunch, eh?
[12:12:23] <shoky> worse, mcnuggets
[12:12:26] <aberrant> if I have a table, and a ul with a given class in a td, how do I reference all the tds with a ul of that class?
[12:12:51] <Whirl3d> $("ul.class td"); ?
[12:13:04] <shoky> ul in teh td
[12:13:05] <aberrant> the ul is in the td
[12:13:05] <Whirl3d> wait
[12:14:19] <Whirl3d> $("td:contains("ul.class")").....not sure about the syntax. but something like that. I'll look it up
[12:14:42] <aberrant> Whirl3d: thank you. I'm very new to this. I'm trying to change the background of the <td> if the ul exists within.
[12:14:43] <shoky> i'd prolly just do $('td ul.class').closest('td')
[12:15:18] <aberrant> shoky: and then .attr(…)?
[12:15:25] <shoky> :contains is for text
[12:15:37] <shoky> aberrant: ya
[12:15:45] <aberrant> k, lemme try that.
[12:15:49] <shoky> better yet .css(...)
[12:16:00] <aberrant> closest seems a bit kludgy but perhaps it's deterministic enough
[12:16:06] <aberrant> .css. Need to look that up
[12:16:07] <shoky> wat?
[12:17:13] <shoky> why kludgy
[12:17:50] <aberrant> shoky: perfect: 	$('td ul.errorlist').closest('td').css('background','red');
[12:17:58] <shoky> yarr
[12:18:07] <aberrant> because "closest" isn't absolute. What about "parent" or something?
[12:18:31] <shoky> you said the ul is in the td. you didn't say the ul is a direct child of the td
[12:18:39] <shoky> i am only following your orders sir
[12:18:53] <aberrant> hehehe
[12:18:57] <aberrant> no, I appreciate it. Thank you.
[12:19:01] <aberrant> I'm keeping it :)
[12:19:01] <shoky> ;p
[12:19:23] <shoky> a "cleaner" way would be $('td').has('ul.errorlist')
[12:19:24] <aberrant> if the ul is a direct child of the td, is "parent" better?
[12:19:29] <shoky> but that would be less performant
[12:19:30] <aberrant> oh.
[12:19:33] <shoky> i believe
[12:19:47] <shoky> because jquery's sizzle engine parses selectors from right to left
[12:19:49] <aberrant> maybe, but it's easier to read
[12:20:03] <shoky> then go for it ;p
[12:20:10] <shoky> unless you have tons of tds :S
[12:20:18] <Whirl3d> shoky, your advice on how to abstract this. I have three views of the same model that I need to prepare, this seems a little redundant: http://jsfiddle.net/7cxtp/9/
[12:20:20] <shoky> and only a few of them with that ul.errorlist
[12:20:35] <aberrant> I have lots of tds, but hopefully very few w/ errors.
[12:20:42] <aberrant> lots = < 100
[12:21:07] <shoky> well thats probably not a lot, maybe on IE6 or something it'd be noticable ;p
[12:21:28] <rbennacer> hey guys
[12:21:54] <rbennacer> is there a way to tell how many google +1 a page has with javascript
[12:22:23] <aberrant> damn, shoky, this is awesome. Thank you.
[12:22:35] <shoky> Whirl3d: hmm it'd be much easier if there was context. could you put some html/js that calls your API ?
[12:22:44] <shoky> aberrant np
[12:23:02] <Whirl3d> sure. gimme just a second.
[12:23:14] <sunbeam> jQuery('#container').css('background-image','images/html_background_old.jpg');
[12:23:28] <sunbeam> does anyone know how come background-image doesn't work as value for jquery function .css
[12:23:38] <rbennacer> i feel like there have no API
[12:23:52] <shoky> sunbeam: it should work fine, as a string
[12:24:04] <sunbeam> shoky: really doesn't seem like
[12:24:27] <shoky> oh
[12:24:29] <fantasyxdream> HI
[12:24:30] <fantasyxdream> ALL
[12:24:32] <shoky> you need the url( )
[12:24:43] <shoky> @ sunbeam
[12:24:55] <rbennacer> any idea?
[12:24:59] <sunbeam> oh probably i need to use the url yea sorry
[12:25:01] <sunbeam> full url i mean
[12:25:18] <shoky> no i mean you need to put 'url(images/html_background_old.jpg)'
[12:25:43] <fantasyxdream> CAN SOME ONE TELL ME HOW TO CODING THE DATEPICKER? I WANT TO SET THE INFOMATION IN TO THE DAY, AND CHECK IT OUT WHEN I NEED
[12:25:55] <fantasyxdream> ANY ONE KNOW HOW TO DO?
[12:25:59] <shoky> fantasyxdream: stop yelling , calm down, and ask your question in lowercase.
[12:27:15] <sunbeam> shoky: hmm still doesn't
[12:27:33] <sunbeam> shoky: oh wait jquery on ipad doesn't properly work?
[12:27:35] <fantasyxdream> yes, I am making a remind list, and also want to write some text in the day, i use the datepicke but I don't know how to add information on it
[12:27:42] <fantasyxdream> anyone help me?
[12:27:54] <shoky> sunbeam: jquery works on browsers with javascript
[12:28:39] <BinaryKitten> also jquery works on other platforms that support the DOM
[12:28:40] <sunbeam> dont know if ios ha sthat
[12:28:41] <sunbeam> i guess
[12:28:46] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: oh
[12:28:49] <RonaldoMcDonald> Whirl3d, I think I figured it out. My problem was I needed $.proxy to gain access to the calling object which held my jquery instance. Similar to your case?
[12:28:54] <sunbeam> then i reall have no clue how come this dnot work
[12:28:54] <shoky> sure, but that has nothing to do with his question
[12:28:59] <sunbeam> jQuery('#container').css('background-image','images/html_background_old.jpg');
[12:29:06] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam so, iOS doesn't by default
[12:29:16] <BinaryKitten> but you can write wrapped apps that do
[12:29:17] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: doesn't?
[12:29:24] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: why not
[12:29:29] <shoky> doesn't?
[12:29:31] <BinaryKitten> no iOS does not have DOM
[12:29:38] <BinaryKitten> safari does
[12:29:48] <BinaryKitten> safari runs on iOS
[12:29:51] <fantasyxdream> he guys can you tell me how to set the cookie in jquery?
[12:29:52] <BinaryKitten> etc etc
[12:29:57] <shoky> ..
[12:30:04] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: so it should work
[12:30:11] <sunbeam> because other things also work
[12:30:13] <shoky> sunbeam have you tried url( )
[12:30:17] <sunbeam> i mean jquery works perfectly
[12:30:21] <sunbeam> shoky: argh
[12:30:29] <BinaryKitten> shoky that would help :D
[12:30:29] <shoky> ?
[12:30:36] <BinaryKitten> wish i had noticed that ...
[12:30:40] <shoky> i've said it 3 times already..
[12:30:42] <fantasyxdream> I mean... set the cookie when i refash page... it still in that case
[12:31:12] <sunbeam> sorry shoky and BinaryKitten
[12:31:24] <BinaryKitten> fantasyxdream be careful using cookies
[12:31:39] <fantasyxdream> ? why?
[12:31:43] <BinaryKitten> there is legal rules that involve cookie usage
[12:32:11] <fantasyxdream> I learning how cookie work in jquery
[12:32:17] <BinaryKitten> if your site is accessible to EU citizens you need to have "opt in" for non system cookie usage
[12:32:20] <ciss> hi, using jquery 1.7.2, what is the recommended way to handle global custom events that are not related to a specific element: should i trigger them on document? should i use a global object instead? or am i completely off?
[12:32:27] <BinaryKitten> fantasyxdream they don't directly..
[12:32:52] <fantasyxdream> do you have some advise for the jQuery? binarykitten?
[12:33:26] <BinaryKitten> fantasyxdream you can use the jquery cookie plugin, which does a bit of manual work for you..   or write them directly using the standard javascript ..
[12:34:15] <fantasyxdream> ho thanks... let me check it out
[12:34:51] <sekretskwerl> how can one populate data into a x-jquery-tmpl without using .tmpl() somewhere? doesn't seem like it should be possible, but I'm looking at some code here where data is being populated into a script id "clients-row-template" and that text is found nowhere else in the entire code.
[12:35:07] <ciss> hm, this ticket seems to suggest document: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11717
[12:35:09] <shoky> ciss: i usually use <body> for that. prolly document/window is fine too, not sure
[12:35:23] <fantasyxdream> hey you guys know the mootools and jquery which one is more active?
[12:35:39] <BinaryKitten> fantasyxdream for hte plugin https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[12:35:45] <procrastubator> Whirl3d: SOrry, got off my seat for a bit, how do I use a console if I am developing locally (on my hard drive?)
[12:35:49] <BinaryKitten> fantasyxdream they are both as active as each other
[12:35:56] <BinaryKitten> they are both different beasts though
[12:36:14] <ciss> shoky: thanks, i guess i'll go with document then
[12:36:35] <fantasyxdream> <BinaryKitten> the drag and drop in mootools so great...
[12:37:09] <sekretskwerl> is it possible to feed data with .tmpl into something besides script id? even if its the root dom element?
[12:37:17] <fantasyxdream> BinaryKitten thanks very much for the cookie
[12:39:43] <Whirl3d> procrastubator, check out chrome dev tools or firebug
[12:40:20] <Kogster> so, I have this menu, and I have colors associated with each item on the menu that changes colors on other parts of the page. I want to know if I can do something like <div id='menu1' name='#010101'> and then get the 'name' property through jquery
[12:40:56] <BinaryKitten> yep you can
[12:41:07] <Kogster> how do I get the property?
[12:41:12] <Kogster> is my question
[12:41:14] <BinaryKitten> ?.attr
[12:41:16] <sekretskwerl> $(#menu1).attr('name')
[12:41:18] <ciss> i wonder if firequery will someday support .on() the same way it did with .bind()
[12:41:23] <Kogster> oh
[12:41:24] <Kogster> sweet
[12:41:32] <sekretskwerl> but with "" around the dom element id.
[12:41:32] <Kogster> can I make my own attributes?
[12:41:36] <BinaryKitten> Kogster but recommend using something like <div id="menu1" data-color="#010101">
[12:41:51] <BinaryKitten> then using $('#menu1').data('color')
[12:41:57] <Kogster> oh
[12:42:01] <Kogster> can I make my own data?
[12:42:03] <Kogster> like data-foo
[12:42:06] <BinaryKitten> yep
[12:42:08] <Kogster> sweet
[12:42:09] <ciss> being able to inspect event handlers on an object was an extremely useful feature
[12:42:09] <Kogster> that's awesome
[12:42:24] <Kogster> I keep having nerdgasms playing with jquery~
[12:42:29] <BinaryKitten> data-color="red" data-background="pppp"
[12:42:32] <Kogster> thanks BK, sekretskwerl
[12:42:48] <Whirl3d> shoky, this is still terribly rough.. Just trying to abstract my "view" creator so that addSlide isn't so literal...
[12:42:49] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/7cxtp/15/
[12:43:47] <procrastubator> Also if the CSS settings set the font and the size in a div (it's assigned using a class), how come changing CSS properties using .css() doesn't override it?
[12:43:49] <sekretskwerl> im not finding any way that it is possible to populate a x-jquery-tmpl without directly calling the script id with .tmpl()
[12:43:55] <procrastubator> As in the font gets changed, but the font size does not....
[12:43:58] <sekretskwerl> and if that's the case, I can't figure out how this table is getting its data.
[12:44:38] <shoky> Whirl3d:  you missed a dot :P holder.find("contentPanel");     (and 2 more)
[12:45:48] <digs> What can I use to replace this line: $('#quote').live('DOMSubtreeModified',function(){ ... });  -- DOMSubtreeModified is deprecated and I am not sure of its support currently, (it works in chrome). However, this one line does what 10 lines do it accounts for 2 other cases I _have_ to cover.
[12:46:05] <dilvie> digs: why would you get flogged for that?
[12:46:39] <digs> Because I have found the other channel to be abusive for doing things outside of standard practice
[12:47:13] <Whirl3d> thanks....I am sure there are other typos in there...
[12:47:27] <digs> And for using a deprecated elements.
[12:47:30] <digs> -s
[12:47:37] <shoky> Whirl3d i get ajax SOP eror ;<
[12:47:58] <Whirl3d> I'll pos the data manually. brb
[12:52:00] <dilvie> digs: there is no working replacement
[12:52:09] <aaronmason> .
[12:52:16] <dilvie> in DOM level 3
[12:52:22] <dilvie> DOM level 4 has mutation observers
[12:52:23] <dilvie> http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#mutation-observers
[12:52:53] <digs> dilvie, what is the support level of this? Will it work in IE, FF, etc ? I couldn't find that information because I don't know where to look and the links I found didn't seem to tell me.
[12:53:16] <digs> dilvie, yeah, I noticed that... seems like it will be a while before those are available cross broswer/platform
[12:55:16] <dilvie> digs: some support coming in Chromium. MDN has not updated their mutation events docs, so support in FF? I don't know. MDN warns, "Adding DOM mutation listeners to a document profoundly degrades the performance of further DOM modifications to that document (making them 1.5 - 7 times slower!). Moreover, removing the listeners does not reverse the damage."
[12:55:24] <dilvie> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Mutation_events
[12:55:45] <Whirl3d> hmmm....http://jsfiddle.net/7cxtp/22/
[12:55:50] <dilvie> basically, observing changes to DOM is not currently well supported in any browser.
[12:56:51] <dilvie> the feature is deprecated because the original spec was not well designed, and it's likely to vanish entirely in future (current?) versions of the browsers.
[12:57:06] <dilvie> so we're waiting for DOM level 4 mutations to land in the new browsers.
[12:58:24] <Whirl3d> I just can't help but feel that a "buildView" method would be better and then I could call buildView (gallery, viewname, config)  where viewname would be "slide", "thumb", "index"....
[12:58:56] <Whirl3d> so that later I could add a view easily
[12:58:56] <digs> dilvie, so... what can I do?

[13:01:22] <diverdude> Normally when  i submit a form i invoke the submit button, and the entire form is submitted to the server. Is there a similar way to submit the whole form in a ajax call?
[13:02:46] <BinaryKitten> yep
[13:03:15] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, is it possible to prevent alt text from popping up without deleting alt tag?
[13:03:21] <BinaryKitten> easiest way is the ajax form plugin.. http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[13:03:42] <BinaryKitten> d3f4ultr0 give a title of "" ?
[13:04:07] <d3f4ultr0> they don't want to delete the value
[13:04:08] <BinaryKitten> but if that doesn't work, and no guarentee it will, no. As it's a browser behaviour
[13:04:14] <d3f4ultr0> ah
[13:04:23] <BinaryKitten> d3f4ultr0 not alt .. title
[13:04:40] <BinaryKitten> title = default for hover titles, followed by alt
[13:05:03] <d3f4ultr0> you're right. I see title
[13:05:29] <shoky> Whirl3d: hmm sure you could make a buildView function if the views are kinda the same.. (and it seems the 'slide' view is pretty different from the other 2 right now)
[13:05:31] <BinaryKitten> diverdude: sorry if you caught it, but give this plugin a try http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[13:05:34] <chrisbdaemon> I have some javascript and an iframe in a page, the iframe takes a really long time to load and the $(window).load() code doesn't seem to run until after the iframe is loaded.. is there a way to get the code to not wait for the iframe to load?
[13:06:02] <BinaryKitten> chrisbdaemon why are you waiting on window load?
[13:06:14] <shoky> Whirl3d: also i would've prolly used just put .data() on only one element. but i dont really know how you're gonna use those
[13:06:21] <BinaryKitten> $(document).ready()
[13:06:32] <Whirl3d> see the issue is that I have a "relative" view where I get the user's height and generate a picture of a person standing next to the image for perspective...
[13:06:34] <shoky> Whirl3d: other than that.. adunno ;P
[13:06:50] <chrisbdaemon> BinaryKitten: its code i didn't write.. i'm just trying to fix it, does load wait till all the resources are loaded compared to ready waiting for only the dom?
[13:07:10] <Whirl3d> and of course, I'll need a "coverflow-esque" view, I am sure
[13:07:11] <BinaryKitten> chrisbdaemon it's waiting for everying in the window to load
[13:07:13] <BinaryKitten> thus the iframe
[13:07:17] <chrisbdaemon> ah, thanks
[13:07:40] <BinaryKitten> change it from $(window).load(function     to      $(document).ready(function   or even $(function
[13:08:01] <chrisbdaemon> BinaryKitten: yea, i'm familiar with the code i need, thanks :)
[13:08:43] <BinaryKitten> chrisbdaemon no worries.. best to be safe than sorry on these ones
[13:08:55] <chrisbdaemon> BinaryKitten: thanks for the help
[13:09:12] <shoky> Whirl3d hmm sorry i dont really know how you intend to use that code (and what kind of stuff you might add to it), but it doesn't seem like a big issue in your code, to me
[13:09:59] <Whirl3d> I was wondering how to use .pipe with an indeterminate number of iterations...or is that possible...
[13:10:25] <shoky> o i was wondering how come you pipe the image loading
[13:11:07] <Whirl3d> If an image fails, I want to remove it and replace it with a "default" if necessary...
[13:11:20] <Whirl3d> all except the main slide of course
[13:11:45] <shoky> mmm why does that lead to piping?
[13:12:13] <Whirl3d> I thought it would be best to load sequentially.
[13:12:25] <Whirl3d> so one loads, then loads the next, then the next
[13:13:07] <shoky> oks, tho i'd trust the browser to know what's best
[13:13:34] <Whirl3d> so just give it all the loads at once and let it figure it out?
[13:13:47] <jeffsmykil> What is the prefer method for mainting minified and development code and deploying it to a customer?
[13:13:55] <shoky> yepp, i think
[13:14:34] <Whirl3d> would you load all of the images at once or just use lazy loading to load them as neeeded?
[13:15:05] <shoky> mmm if there are many then prolly lazy loading
[13:15:05] <Whirl3d> always less than 30 images..
[13:15:20] <shoky> big ones?
[13:15:47] <Whirl3d> only for the "detailed" view...maybe only lazy load those
[13:16:24] <shoky> with regards to the order of the slides, you MAY want to pipe/make it sequential. i was just asking about piping those 3 loads of the image and its thumb/index
[13:17:02] <shoky> mmm
[13:17:05] <Whirl3d> So I just figured out something...I'll configure the view to take over it's presentation of gallery data and each view will have it's own "addSlide" method...
[13:17:41] <Whirl3d> So when I switch views, I can just rebuild the slides as needed using the new "addSlide" method borrowed from the view
[13:18:57] <shoky> sounds good to me. polymorphism++
[13:19:46] <shoky> sry im not of much help today ;]
[13:20:34] <freeed> Hey guys.. I'm trying to get the numerical index of a li item that has a certain class.. this is working http://d.pr/n/qh6R  but seems clunky.. anyone know of a cleaner approach?
[13:20:44] <Whirl3d> R U kidding? It's always good to have your input...
[13:21:46] <shoky> ;G
[13:21:50] <freeed> like, is there a .attr() that would give me the element index? i.e. $('li.some-class').attr('index…. ?
[13:23:05] <shoky> freeed:  .index() ? one of its variants can probably help you
[13:23:35] <BinaryKitten> freeed yep .index knocking a demo up for you now
[13:23:49] <freeed> cool! :p thanks yall
[13:24:23] <FunnyLookinHat> How do I remove the .draggable() from an element?
[13:24:34] <FunnyLookinHat> So that I can temporarilly make it resizable() ?  :D
[13:24:59] <shoky> FunnyLookinHat: it can be both :P  also,  .draggable('destroy')
[13:25:11] <BinaryKitten> freeed  http://jsfiddle.net/3bSnk/1/
[13:25:19] <FunnyLookinHat> shoky, I tried both but it doesn't seem to...
[13:25:20] <FunnyLookinHat> oh
[13:25:23] <FunnyLookinHat> I should set the handle ?
[13:25:32] <FunnyLookinHat> shoky, They don't play nicely together
[13:25:41] <freeed> Awesome! Thanks BinaryKitten :D
[13:25:46] <shoky> mmm i remember i got it working once
[13:26:25] <shoky> or maybe i did the resizing stuff on my own, could be
[13:27:43] <shoky> ah i used 2 different elements for it, one inside the other
[13:27:58] <shoky> nvm.
[13:28:22] <aghouseh> can someone take a look at a snippet for me? http://pastebin.com/rPLiV5BW I'm trying to cache some ajax'd data, but jq <1.5 does not allow a jqxhr object with a success() method for me to return the data if its not cached. anyone know a workaround?
[13:28:50] <shoky> aghouseh: does not allow ?
[13:29:17] <aghouseh> there is no success() function on the jqxhr object .. as that was 1.5+
[13:29:20] <digs> This has got to be the most frustrating darn thing. I can't believe there is not good way to do this.
[13:29:34] <aghouseh> so if i try jqxhr.success() on my comment, it errors
[13:30:03] <shoky> aghouseh yeah you just have the success callback in the ajax call
[13:30:15] <FunnyLookinHat> shoky, one inside the other - link me to example?  You  mean like... <div><span class="handle"></span></div>
[13:30:29] <shoky> aghouseh: btw , your code wouldn't work on any jquery
[13:30:33] <aghouseh> shoky: so how do i return the json data to the parent function to be returned?
[13:30:54] <shoky> aghouseh: you're trying to synchronously access data from an asynchronous ajax call..
[13:31:03] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ aghouseh
[13:31:07] <shoky> damnit
[13:31:21] <shoky> aghouseh: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[13:31:34] <akahn> Can I 'cancel' some markup that is styled with :hover by using mouseout()? It doesn't seem to work.
[13:31:46] <aghouseh> hmm
[13:32:50] <shoky> FunnyLookinHat: sorry i dont have an example to give you, and it might've been messier than i remember ;P
[13:33:57] <aghouseh> hmm
[13:34:22] <shoky> aghouseh: use newer jquery plz :)
[13:34:32] <aghouseh> shoky: i wish! cant :)
[13:34:38] <shoky> yack :P
[13:35:33] <Carlitta87> I'm trying to create a slideshow but the large image won't appear : http://demo.devmediastudios.com/neighbours2/nmcms.php?snippet=properties&p=viewpropertydetails&pid=17360#
[13:35:47] <Carlitta87> wen using firebug the image is there but for sum reason its not showing on my site
[13:35:57] <digs> Is there any other way I can detect when the inner contents of a div change/
[13:36:57] <BinaryKitten> digs for what purpose
[13:37:15] <aghouseh> hm
[13:38:39] <digs> https://www.fdanconia.com/ten-variety -- Add a product to the cart... click checkout... fill out a valid address -- shipping quotes ajax calls are fired when on blur of the zip code... or when you scroll down and click on the "calculate shipping" button. I have 0 control of those events. However, the div #quote contains the shipping quote info.
[13:38:50] <digs> I need to use that info in another place on the page.
[13:39:27] <poppiez> when uploading a file in a form using a type="file" input field, what format is it sent in? I want to be able to programatically upload a file in a form without selecting one. should it be the data URI or?
[13:40:20] <BinaryKitten> digs you can look at delegation
[13:40:30] <digs> So, #quote is empty when the page is first loaded... and then is filled via an AJAX call. I just need to know when it is filled or when it changes so that I can fire my own event.
[13:40:32] <BinaryKitten> if you're looking to bind an event to #quote
[13:40:46] <NoiseEee> poppiez: " I want to be able to programatically upload a file in a form without selecting one"  you don't get to do that
[13:40:57] <BinaryKitten> but there is no event saying "this has new content"
[13:41:07] <digs> BinaryKitten, can you elaborate some please. I do not understand.
[13:41:43] <BinaryKitten> ok digs you can delegate event to a parent item that says when an event happens inside me on an item that meets this criteria .. do X
[13:41:44] <digs> well... at this point... I have to hack something together... I realize there isn't an event. I just need some way to do this that will work in all browsers.
[13:42:16] <digs> but what event?
[13:42:20] <BinaryKitten> any
[13:42:29] <digs> But there isn't an event that detects change.
[13:42:31] <xid> how can I insert text inside the contents of an element?
[13:42:32] <BinaryKitten> but that won't tell you that the content has change
[13:42:34] <poppiez> NoiseEee: I need to upload a file to an API on a server but I don't have the image locally. so I was thinking it's possible to download the image using jquery and then send the image data to the API
[13:42:44] <xid> append() seems to be making the contents some kind of array
[13:42:45] <digs> Correct... so that does nothing to solve the problem.
[13:42:47] <xid> which is not what I want
[13:43:17] <BinaryKitten> does the code need to run as soon as the new content gets inserted
[13:43:19] <BinaryKitten> OR
[13:43:29] <BinaryKitten> can it be run at a later time afterwards
[13:43:36] <digs> define later
[13:43:38] <BinaryKitten> like on user interaction with a certain part
[13:44:00] <digs> I have to assume there will be no user interaction I can bind to.
[13:44:19] <BinaryKitten> ok so what are you going to do with the data in the div?
[13:44:22] <poppiez> NoiseEee: basically, is it possible to send the base64 of the image to the API
[13:44:51] <xid> like, I don't want to do .val(), but i want to append to the contents of the <option> without making it a multipart object
[13:45:07] <digs> $('#quote input:radio:checked').each(function() { $.get(\"https://www.fdanconia.com/uc_fedex_jquery_callback/\"+ $(this).val()); });
[13:45:10] <xid> it's coming out <object>"content 1" \n "content 2"</object>
[13:45:25] <BinaryKitten> urm ouch?
[13:45:31] <xid> append() has an undesirable effect
[13:45:46] <digs> I mean, my LAST resort is to just do that every half a second.
[13:45:47] <BinaryKitten> only 1 can be checked, why the each?
[13:46:10] <digs> Do I not need the each?
[13:46:17] <BinaryKitten> nope
[13:46:18] <shoky> Carlitta87:  it has to do with the overflow:auto and position:relative  that you have on .slideshow class
[13:46:19] <digs> okay.
[13:46:26] * digs didn't know that.
[13:46:36] <BinaryKitten> since it's looping over 1 item
[13:46:36] <xid> oh i need to use .html() duh
[13:46:39] <xid> thanks for nothiun
[13:46:47] <BinaryKitten> digs ok..
[13:46:55] <BinaryKitten> is #quote always there?
[13:47:12] <shoky> Carlitta87: and also the line-height on the <img> element is making it display in the wrong place
[13:47:44] <digs> Yes.
[13:47:49] <BinaryKitten> awesome
[13:48:41] <BinaryKitten> digs a pastebin coming your way
[13:49:18] <digs> Thank you very much for your help.
[13:49:35] <digs> It has been... 8 hours of work thus far on this :/
[13:49:50] <aghouseh> shoky: so yeah i knew about the async thing, but my problem is how do i implement it to work without using .success() ? :o
[13:50:07] <aghouseh> since i do not have that jqxhr.success() available to me
[13:50:18] <shoky> aghouseh: you have the success callback available to you
[13:50:27] <aghouseh> but how do i return it to the parent function
[13:50:30] <shoky> you dont
[13:50:45] <aghouseh> hm
[13:51:31] <aghouseh> so i guess im at a loss as to how to structure this so i can just call some data via ID and have it either get via ajax and then return the data or if the array item exists, just return that
[13:51:56] <BinaryKitten> digs http://jsbin.com/olizuv/2/edit
[13:52:00] <aghouseh> maybe im thinking about it backwards
[13:52:02] * digs loks
[13:52:20] <shoky> aghouseh: whatever needs to happen after the ajax call you do in your callback(s)
[13:52:36] <BinaryKitten> if you need a pre 1.7 version let me know
[13:52:54] <aghouseh> i just updated the paste.. http://pastebin.com/rPLiV5BW
[13:52:56] <digs> I do actually.
[13:53:18] <BinaryKitten> digs which version of jQuery
[13:53:24] <digs> 1.4
[13:53:26] <aghouseh> thats the full function
[13:53:31] <shoky> aghouseh: well you're not returning anything in one case ;P
[13:53:45] <aghouseh> right i know because i havent figured out the right way yet
[13:53:52] <shoky> i told you the right way
[13:53:55] <shoky> dont :)
[13:53:55] <BinaryKitten> digs 1.4   1.4.1  1.4.2 ?
[13:53:59] <aghouseh> hah
[13:54:00] <digs> sorry.
[13:54:11] <digs> 1.4.2 I am 99% sure... let me double check.
[13:54:14] <BinaryKitten> don't be, it's not usually important
[13:55:03] <shoky> aghouseh: whatever is calling that function, if it gets back something that isn't 'undefined' then that means there wont be any ajax request so do whatever you want with the returned value
[13:55:23] <digs> 1.4.4
[13:55:29] <shoky> aghouseh: and if undefined is returned, then dont do anything yet, because the stuff is only gonna happen in the success callback
[13:55:40] <aghouseh> shoky: but the same thing has to be done in either case
[13:55:41] <BinaryKitten> digs awesome
[13:55:41] <aghouseh> i see.
[13:56:39] <aghouseh> im just thinking of it backwards i guess
[13:56:55] <BinaryKitten> digs http://jsbin.com/olizuv/3/edit
[13:56:55] <shoky> aghouseh: 1.4.x is backwards :P
[14:00:10] <BinaryKitten> digs that make sense?
[14:01:43] <digs> Makes sense... but doesn't seem to work.
[14:02:02] <BinaryKitten> ok
[14:02:33] <digs> ahh....
[14:02:49] <digs> I need to wrap it $(window).bind('load', function() {
[14:03:23] <BinaryKitten> nope
[14:03:33] <BinaryKitten> not a bind, not a load
[14:03:34] <digs> it works when I do though
[14:03:36] <BinaryKitten> a ready
[14:03:45] <BinaryKitten> load and ready are different things
[14:03:52] <BinaryKitten> $(document).ready
[14:04:08] <digs> okay.
[14:04:09] <BinaryKitten> or even $(function() { // your code here })'
[14:04:34] <BinaryKitten> window.load is a very different event it can be held up by other things on the page
[14:04:42] <shoky> aghouseh: if you want it to look a bit more as if you're using the jqxhr.success()  you can do something like: http://pastebin.com/ESbe1L9K
[14:05:17] <shoky> or something liek that.
[14:06:48] <BinaryKitten> anyway .. glad you got it working deg
[14:06:54] <BinaryKitten> *digs
[14:08:09] <shoky> oh my, jqueryUI 1.8.21
[14:09:21] <digs> hm
[14:09:51] <digs> I thought it was working and it is not... I have to head home though and I will get back on in like 20 min. Will you be here?
[14:12:18] <drakythe> Weird question: I have a commerce site I'm iframing into another site (same company, 2 different incompatible platforms, so the commerce is just iframed in) Natively, the commerce site has a jump happening when a button is pressed (the scrollbar goes back to the top) but it won't do that to the iframe's scroll bar. Is there a way around that?
[14:12:40] <digs> BinaryKitten, this is the code... http://jsbin.com/amumih/edit#javascript,html,live  -- the page is https://www.fdanconia.com/cart/checkout -- you have to add something to the cart first.
[14:12:42] <drakythe> (The jump is happening via js)
[14:12:53] <digs> I will be back in a about 20-30 mi.
[14:15:48] <shoky> drakythe: got the code for the jump?
[14:16:43] <tw2113> would jsfiddle handle a jquery plugin full code?
[14:16:55] <tw2113> or should i put the plugin code into a remote file and link to it?
[14:17:09] <shoky> either is fine in my experience
[14:19:05] <drakythe> Shoky: sorry, my corwork is the one who put the code in place, I'm pulling it into a place where I can view the raw code, one minute
[14:19:57] <aghouseh> shoky:  thanks for the help!
[14:20:00] <aghouseh> you da man
[14:20:20] <shoky> ;]
[14:20:52] <tw2113> shoky, haven't managed to get the append to work. Here's what I have for a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/VhqeM/
[14:21:02] <tw2113> actual plugin https://raw.github.com/tw2113/tweetQuery/master/tweetquery-000003.js
[14:21:24] <tw2113> i'm questioning if my use of "this" in the success callback is targeting the right thing
[14:22:22] <drakythe> shoky: my site's jump code: http://jsfiddle.net/NLBaA/
[14:26:02] <shoky> tw2113: you want to just access the jq obj you called it on, right?
[14:26:38] <shoky> tw2113: just cache that bitch  var self = this;
[14:26:45] <tw2113> yeah, i want to return the resulting data to the $('#tweets')
[14:27:05] <tw2113> inside the success callback?
[14:27:22] <tw2113> or like right below the myoptions extension?
[14:27:29] <shoky> no, as first line in $.fn.tweetQuery
[14:27:57] <tw2113> ooh
[14:27:59] <tw2113> that works
[14:28:04] <shoky> ;P
[14:29:02] <tw2113> this may almost be ready for closer production use now
[14:29:14] <shoky> ;-D
[14:30:51] <tw2113> thanks :D
[14:31:57] <shoky> ;P didnt yo momma teach you to be wary with 'this' y'all
[14:32:15] <tw2113> this is my first jquery plugin and it's been awhile since I touched it
[14:32:50] <shoky> oo sweet. so.. be wary, be very very wary
[14:32:51] <tw2113> i haven't even minimized it yet
[14:33:08] <shoky> i haven't minimized anything ever yet ;<
[14:33:50] * drakythe minimizes his chat window D'oh!
[14:33:55] <shoky> luckily the company i work at barely has any clients so we dont give a shit about the bandwidth/response time
[14:34:08] <shoky> u can minimize windows???
[14:34:38] <drakythe> Fancy new features of this "Windows" OS, or somesuch nonsense ;)
[14:35:26] <shoky> schmancy
[14:39:29] <Whirl3d> can you unbind multiple bindings using an array? $(element).unbind([next, prev, enter, exit]); ?
[14:39:33] <shoky> drakythe: it works here :P http://jsfiddle.net/NLBaA/2/   (button is at bottom of iframe doc)
[14:40:13] <digs> BinaryKitten, I am back.
[14:40:16] <drakythe> shoky: Alright... that is just plain odd, guess I'll do some digging
[14:40:20] <shoky> Whirl3d: event namespaces no gewd ?
[14:40:23] <BinaryKitten> digs
[14:40:23] <BinaryKitten> ok
[14:40:29] <BinaryKitten> looked at the page
[14:40:37] <BinaryKitten> seems that jQuery is running, but not as $
[14:40:42] <BinaryKitten> as $ returns undefined
[14:40:57] <digs> I have to wrap it.
[14:41:05] <Whirl3d> shoky, good point. Not sure why I didn't implement them in the first place. I'll do that now.
[14:41:13] <digs> (function ($) { ... })(jQuery);
[14:41:17] <BinaryKitten> :)
[14:41:20] <BinaryKitten> or
[14:41:25] <shoky> Whirl3d: :D:D
[14:41:32] <BinaryKitten> jQuery(function($) { ..... })
[14:41:36] <digs> heh.
[14:41:44] <BinaryKitten> which gives you onReady and $ mapping
[14:42:21] <BinaryKitten> also i couldn't get it to show radios
[14:42:32] <BinaryKitten> so couldn't figure out past that small part
[14:42:57] <digs> Oh... you have to fill out a valid address in the ship to.
[14:43:08] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[14:43:15] <digs> Then you can click calculate shipping button or on blur from the shipping zip code.
[14:43:21] <BinaryKitten> ah
[14:43:29] <digs> Those events are triggered ajax calls that I can't bind to.
[14:43:29] * BinaryKitten is not a US peep
[14:43:33] <digs> ahh.
[14:43:38] <digs> here is an address...
[14:43:47] * BinaryKitten needs to go to sleep for work though
[14:43:56] <BinaryKitten> 11pm here now (well 1/4 to)
[14:44:05] <digs> 26860 Jefferson Ave. Murrieta, CA 92562
[14:44:10] <digs> ahh :/
[14:44:28] <BinaryKitten> hopefully wrapping jQuery will fix it, otherwise I'm sure someone else will help take up the torch if you ask
[14:44:34] <BinaryKitten> sorry I can't stay longer
[14:44:58] <digs> No problem.
[14:45:02] <digs> I completely understand.
[14:45:07] <BinaryKitten> :D
[14:45:11] <digs> Thank you for your help thus far.
[14:45:24] <BinaryKitten> no problem. gnight
[14:45:31] <digs> night
[14:47:02] <someprimetime> i'm detecting the mousewheel event and positioning an overflow-y: scroll; div to move up and down depending on the delta, which moves the container, but the scrollbar doesn't scroll like it normally should.. any ideas?
[14:50:36] <diverdude> i have an array of input type=hidden elements. I need to remove all input type=hidden elements in a container except for those in the array. How do i do that?
[14:51:19] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, use arielFleischer's scrollTo plugin with the mousewheel extension?
[14:51:37] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: yeah i'll check that out thanks this is becoming a PITA
[14:51:46] <Whirl3d> or maybe get some insight into how they did it
[14:51:49] <Whirl3d> PITA?
[14:51:53] <Whirl3d> nvm
[14:51:54] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:52:18] <diverdude> any1?
[14:54:39] <Whirl3d> var lst=arr.join(", "); $("input:hidden").not(list); ?
[14:55:03] <Whirl3d> wait, wrong...sorry
[14:56:57] <Whirl3d> $.each(arr, function (element) {$(element).addClass("keeper");}); $("input:hidden").not(".keeper").remove();
[14:57:32] <Whirl3d> basically, add a class to the hidden elements in your array and then use .not to select all the hidden elements not of that class
[14:58:42] <Whirl3d> can you do $([items]) to successfully convert an array to jqobject?
[15:00:29] <diverdude> Whirl3d: why is this not working? $(this).parent().find("input[type=hidden]").not($(this).find("input[type=hidden]")).remove()
[15:01:23] <Whirl3d> id need to see it in context, really.
[15:01:23] <diverdude> Whirl3d: the elements found with $(this).parent().find("input[type=hidden]") and $(this).find("input[type=hidden]") are correct
[15:02:12] <Whirl3d> but without the remove() what subset are you getting?
[15:02:39] <Raydiation> i have a div that has a max-height of 300px and overflow auto. how can i animate it to get the full height?
[15:02:47] <Raydiation> e.g. remove the overflow and max-height
[15:03:39] <Whirl3d> remove the overlflow and maxheight using .css and animate to the new height...you'll prolly have to use scrollHeight to calculate the new height, but I am not sure...
[15:05:45] <Whirl3d> something like $("element").css({max-height:undefined, overflow: 'none'}).animate({height:newHeight}, 800);
[15:09:33] <Raydiation> its possible with css transitions http://jsfiddle.net/leaverou/zwvNY/
[15:11:52] <Raydiation> imo getting the height with js would be a bit hacky
[15:13:11] <Whirl3d> so, you answered your own question then?
[15:13:28] <Raydiation> well, dunno, id like an elegant way with jquery
[15:13:35] <Raydiation> if nothing works, ill go for css transitions
[15:14:11] <Whirl3d> define elegant?
[15:14:55] <Raydiation> Whirl3d: built in
[15:15:23] <Whirl3d> lol
[15:15:33] <Whirl3d> elegant is a matter of perspective now isn't it.
[15:16:15] <Raydiation> well, why manually get the height and then scroll to it if there could be a way to use this with a standard function
[15:16:18] <Whirl3d> some would classify a builtin method to animate the max-height and overlow properties of element as anything but elegant...more like bloat
[15:16:52] <Whirl3d> the scrollheight is a property that determines how much you can scroll
[15:17:05] <Whirl3d> you add that to your max-height to get the final height of the element
[15:17:09] <Whirl3d> no scrolling involved
[15:17:40] <Raydiation> Whirl3d: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9209228/jquery-animate-height-to-auto ?
[15:18:12] <Whirl3d> precisely
[15:22:05] <Raydiation> Whirl3d: ty
[15:22:13] <Whirl3d> np....
[15:26:02] <rgrinberg> Say I had an array of image urls. What would be the best way to create a 5 by x table to show these images?
[15:26:55] <blindMoe> I would most likely do that with php unless the images were being loaded by ajax or something
[15:27:31] <Whirl3d> blindMoe, really?
[15:27:47] <kanja> is there a function that will tell me which nth child an element is?
[15:28:03] <Whirl3d> how about the nthChild selector?
[15:28:31] <kanja> I have the elment already - it's responding to an event.
[15:28:36] <kanja> Whirl3d: ^
[15:28:40] <Whirl3d> http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[15:28:55] <Whirl3d> huh?
[15:29:06] <Whirl3d> which nthChild?
[15:29:11] <blindMoe> Whirl3d: depends on what the end goal is
[15:29:26] <blindMoe> responding to an event.. would use jquery obviously :)
[15:29:26] <kanja> Whirl3d: I need the reverse of that - from an element give the n, rather than from the n select the child
[15:29:43] <Whirl3d> index()
[15:29:45] <blindMoe> is that what $.indexOf() does?
[15:29:47] <Whirl3d> $(this).index();
[15:29:50] <blindMoe> or year.. just .index
[15:29:55] <blindMoe> err "yeah"  :)
[15:29:59] <kanja> index
[15:30:01] <kanja> awesome
[15:30:07] <kanja> I knew there had to be something
[15:38:44] <rgrinberg> blindMoe: ya I'm trying to avoid refershes
[15:38:54] <rgrinberg> making an ajax call to get the list of images
[15:38:59] <rgrinberg> and then display them on the page
[15:39:18] <rgrinberg> I agree doing it on the server side would be easier but I'm asked to do it specifically this way
[16:37:50] <Chuguniy> Hey guys! Does anyone know a way how to wait until google map is fully downloaded and only then output it, like prefatching?
[16:38:45] <sh1ps> I actually have a question regarding Google Maps too
[16:39:33] <sh1ps> I can't for the life of me get the full google map to display without grey blocks
[16:39:42] <sh1ps> I've tried a million different solutions
[16:40:00] <cmw72> I have an text input and a jquery ui button ... i'm trapping the .keyup event to see if it's keycode 13 (enter key).  Unfortunately ... in Internet Explorer, the button grabs the keypress despite the fact that the text box has focus.  It works fine in firefox, opera, and chrome.  How can I get IE to behave like the other browsers?  event.preventDefault() does not seem to do anything.
[16:40:05] <sh1ps> http://jsfiddle.net/Jf4JH/2/ < --- that seems to be the most applicable, but that doesn't seem to help either
[16:40:27] <sh1ps> cmw72: what version of IE?
[16:41:11] <cmw72> IE 8
[16:42:42] <sh1ps> mind putting your js into a fiddle or something?
[16:42:49] <sh1ps> or letting me see the product?
[16:47:06] <BinaryKitten> cmw72 is the field in a form?
[16:47:44] <BinaryKitten> the issue with keyup is that it's the 3rd key event
[16:47:56] <BinaryKitten> down, press, up is the order of triggering
[16:48:07] <BinaryKitten> on press is when forms are submitted
[16:48:28] <BinaryKitten> so you'll need to match that or be lower in the ordering to beat the submission
[16:48:41] <Inv1s1ble> I'm trying to do a confirm dialog for a submit button...well..several submit buttons. There is a delete button for several dynamic elements on my page. I tried using this to attach an event to each: http://pastebin.com/NXdypHwn
[16:49:06] <Inv1s1ble> I can show the dialog, but I'm not sure how to trigger the element's parent form submits (each button is in its own form)
[16:49:38] <Inv1s1ble> The $(this) in the dialog is the dialog...how do I get the previous button and via it, the parent form to continue the submit() ?
[16:49:51] <cmw72> I don't have it in a form ... essentially, i'm pulling ajax results in realtime based on user input, so i'm polling for a change to that text box, and if it's changed, after a second of inactivity, i pull the results, but i have it set up to pull instantly on enter key.
[16:50:23] <BinaryKitten> ouchy
[16:50:42] <BinaryKitten> ok so what is happening that shouldn't
[16:51:48] <BinaryKitten> have you tried diabling the jquery ui button.
[16:52:11] <BinaryKitten> there is a lot that can't be seen
[16:52:28] <BinaryKitten> anyway.... thought i could help with the keypress thing, but need sleep
[16:52:31] <BinaryKitten> night
[16:52:35] <cmw72> thanks
[16:52:37] <cmw72> g'night
[17:08:38] <c0pp3rnick> how can i trigger event after element is deleted?

[17:16:06] <southpointingcha> So I have a jQuery problem. I've been trying to put together the slider found in MrNickFrosty's video series (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey9_6IqBAPQ).
[17:16:12] <southpointingcha> But for some reason, when the PHP is supposed to start bringing the images through, it doesn't. I don't know why
[17:16:19] <southpointingcha> I'm not really a jQuery/php person
[17:16:57] <southpointingcha> here is my index.php file: http://pastebin.com/qTGYZTnY
[17:17:03] <southpointingcha> here is my css file (the slider stuff is at the bottom): http://pastebin.com/wY8CefDt
[17:17:10] <southpointingcha> and here is my javascript file: http://pastebin.com/ZgfXbfZr
[17:17:16] <southpointingcha> Please let me know if I can help anyone help me. I need to get this done and I'm stuck.
[17:20:13] <lenswipe> hey guys
[17:20:50] <Whirl3d> hey lenswipe
[17:20:55] <lenswipe> can someone help me? im trying to get the trending topics on twitter and the twitter API is giving me back a JSON object filled with arrays as properties (WTF? - I knows)
[17:20:57] <lenswipe> i know*
[17:21:06] <lenswipe> my issue is i want the last array in the object
[17:21:47] <runvnc> trending[trending.length-1]
[17:24:36] <southpointingcha> Does anyone have any suggestions for my slider issue?
[17:33:59] <lenswipe> runvnc, it doesnt like .length
[17:34:03] <lenswipe> runvnc, can you help?
[17:34:08] <lenswipe> southpointingcha, more lube?
[17:34:20] <Whirl3d> what can cause a function to become undefined? I am wroking on a plugin where I use a generic function object to attach methods via prototype inheritance and though the object logs to the console in the script, if I try to type it into the console manually, it is not defined.
[17:34:22] <runvnc> lens can you make a jsfiddle or something or put it on the net
[17:34:44] <runvnc> if there is no length then its not an array
[17:35:07] <lenswipe> runvnc, sure two seconds
[17:35:25] <runvnc> maybe you ended up with an object with properties that look like array indexes but arent or something like trending.0
[17:35:39] <Whirl3d> lenswipe, you could try this: var lst=[]; for (var prop in results) {lst=results[prop]}   then lst will be the last array
[17:35:49] <lenswipe> ill make a fiddle
[17:36:17] <shoky> Whirl3d: where's your function declared
[17:37:03] <lenswipe> runvnc, Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/wHFtG/
[17:37:06] <runvnc> I think whirl3d the console's scope is window and your generic function object is not in that scope, its not a property of window
[17:37:11] <Inv1s1ble> If I add a submit() to a form element, but there are multiple submit buttons with different values...how do I get the value of the one that's clicked?
[17:37:45] <southpointingcha> any suggestions for me... other than lube?
[17:41:22] <shoky> southpointingcha: i dont see any element with id "slider"  ?
[17:41:58] <runvnc> lenswipe, http://jsfiddle.net/t5JTf/1/
[17:42:09] <runvnc> I think actually that won't really work though
[17:42:25] <runvnc> It looks like response.trends is not an array
[17:42:27] <southpointingcha> shoky, all the slider stuff is in "main-slider"
[17:42:27] <runvnc> its an object
[17:42:43] <runvnc> the property names of the trends are a date/time
[17:42:43] <southpointingcha> thank you for your help
[17:43:01] <runvnc> so I think you need to parse those date/times on all of the properties of response.trends
[17:43:10] <aghouseh> best way to run a function from a variable name? ala var direction = "next"; $(element).{direction} or whatever?
[17:43:23] <shoky> southpointingcha: yes there's main-slider but no 'slider'
[17:43:42] <southpointingcha> should there be?
[17:43:54] <shoky> your code has:  $('#slider').nivoSlider();
[17:44:00] <shoky> and:  $(".slider").jslider({
[17:44:02] <southpointingcha> oh
[17:44:04] <southpointingcha> one sec
[17:44:14] <lenswipe> thanks runvnc

[17:44:32] <lenswipe> "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL"
[17:44:34] * lenswipe calls the police
[17:44:49] <southpointingcha> shoky, oops, those were from the nivo slider, which I tried later
[17:44:52] <southpointingcha> they are nto part of this
[17:44:55] <southpointingcha> sorry
[17:45:02] <shoky> southpointingcha: isolate the issue in a jsfiddle
[17:45:14] <southpointingcha> um... I'm very sorry, but I don't know what that means
[17:45:16] <shoky> dont make us rummage through unrelated code..l
[17:45:24] <southpointingcha> ok

[17:45:26] <shoky> southpointingcha: www.jsfiddle.net
[17:45:36] <shoky> or better: www.jqfiddle.net
[17:45:43] <southpointingcha> ok
[17:46:19] <southpointingcha> and then I post the url here?
[17:46:32] <shoky> yap. but make the fiddle work ;P
[17:46:37] <southpointingcha> will do
[17:46:37] <runvnc> lenswipe, http://jsfiddle.net/t5JTf/2/
[17:46:39] <southpointingcha> thank you
[17:46:51] <runvnc> I did not get a syntax error, what line gives you a syntax error?
[17:47:17] <runvnc> If you have trouble with javascript Date() parsing the date/time, this might work with a slight modification http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1308720/javascript-wont-parse-gmt-date-time-format
[17:49:13] <lenswipe> runvnc, i fixed it :)
[17:49:17] <lenswipe> it was just a character issue
[17:51:47] <runvnc> ok I don't see any character issue though
[17:58:52] <southpointingcha> shoky, here's what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/api/post/jquery/1.7.1/

[17:59:34] <shoky> eh php
[18:00:06] <southpointingcha> yeah, I looked, it didn't have that option for the html tab
[18:00:14] <southpointingcha> er, panel

[18:00:52] <shoky> southpointingcha: can you put the php's output instead ?
[18:01:44] <southpointingcha> shoky, man, being incompetent is embarassing - I don't really know what that means
[18:02:22] <southpointingcha> I believe the issue I'm having is related to the php
[18:02:22] <shoky> southpointingcha: the php echos html output and that's what the browser receives (i.e. the browser doesn't see any php code)
[18:02:47] <southpointingcha> so how do I find what it would echo?
[18:03:03] <shoky> do you have it online anywhere?
[18:03:11] <southpointingcha> no, I'm hosting it locally
[18:03:13] <southpointingcha> but I can fix that
[18:03:18] <southpointingcha> if it would make it easier on you
[18:03:33] <tw2113> you're not incompetent, you're just not as educated yet
[18:03:38] <shoky> well it would but you can get it locally, just go to that php page in your browser,
[18:03:42] <shoky> and view-source
[18:03:45] <southpointingcha> ok

[18:14:41] <RonWhoCares> I am trying to make a jquery api so when a graphic submit button (representing to delete) is clicked the corresponding record in the database is erased.  I need help sorting out what to do.  If I post code would someone help me?
[18:15:16] <southpointingcha> let me go back to the tutorial
[18:15:23] <southpointingcha> and make sure I did everything at the end
[18:15:30] <southpointingcha> I'll be back if there are still issues
[18:15:36] <southpointingcha> I really appreciate this
[18:15:42] <runvnc> ok later
[18:17:19] <abisson> Hey guys! Quick question. In this code http://jsfiddle.net/ZfQGp/, in the receive function, is it possible to get the element that was just dropped? UI returns me the element that WAS dropped, but not the new one that was just dropped in the droppable. I want to immediately change the one that was drop in the droppable. (hope it makes sense)
[18:17:51] <runvnc> Whirl3d, are you sure you're not supposed to add all of the methods or functions to the object before you pass it to the plugin maker?
[18:18:09] <Whirl3d> I was just following the example.
[18:18:52] <Whirl3d> Besided I did  in that fiddle./
[18:19:46] <RonWhoCares> my question is @ http://pastebin.com/dVd2T9Ze (including some Jquery and PHP )
[18:20:42] <runvnc> Whirl3d, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[18:21:32] <southpointingcha> so i'm back
[18:21:41] <southpointingcha> it's still not sliding
[18:21:46] <shoky> Whirl3d:   if (_init) {  init.apply(this, $.makeArray(arguments).slice(1)); }
[18:21:53] <shoky> Whirl3d: isn't that supposed to be _init.apply ?
[18:21:53] <southpointingcha> i'm getting the following code in the console:
[18:21:54] <southpointingcha> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://localhost/VoicesForSudan/styles/slider.css
[18:21:54] <southpointingcha> Object

[18:22:11] <southpointingcha> but that's weird
[18:22:18] <southpointingcha> because it shouldn't be acessing that
[18:22:29] <southpointingcha> so let me figure it out a bit more
[18:22:50] <shoky> Whirl3d: also, you're slicing the arguments that you pass to the 'old' init, but that old init is  function(el, opts)  just like the 'new' one
[18:22:54] <abisson> Anyone knows when will the fact that drop() gets called twice with a sortable/droppable be fixed?
[18:23:00] <shoky> Whirl3d: right?
[18:23:06] <Whirl3d> I swear I used to be able to type console.log($("#test")) and it would show me the test div. Now it's null
[18:23:37] <runvnc> whirld3d I thought the point of this was to create a class hierarchy.. I don't see a derived class
[18:23:57] <shoky> i think he didn't get to the subclassing part yet :P
[18:24:16] <southpointingcha> ok, so yeah, just stupidly calling the sheet after I left it
[18:24:26] <southpointingcha> so I'm still at the "not sliding icons not working"
[18:24:35] <southpointingcha> http://jsfiddle.net/CW6pW/3/
[18:24:44] <southpointingcha> shoky, runvnc, thoughts?
[18:27:51] <runvnc> whirl3d I get this console.log($('#test'))
[18:27:51] <runvnc> [div#test]
[18:27:51] <runvnc> undefined
[18:28:04] <runvnc> so its like it prints the div and also undefined
[18:28:07] <runvnc> on chrome
[18:28:39] <shoky> southpointingcha:  if( $("#slide-image-"+slide).is(":hidden") ){
[18:28:46] <shoky> hint: the error is in that line.
[18:28:53] <southpointingcha> hmmm
[18:28:53] <southpointingcha> ok
[18:29:11] <southpointingcha> lol, I don't know javascript
[18:29:17] <southpointingcha> but lets see
[18:29:22] <shoky> its not a javascript issue :)
[18:29:25] <southpointingcha> ah
[18:29:35] <shoky> but also:
[18:29:38] <Whirl3d> runvnc, why am I not getting the same thing when I log $("#test")   I just get nulll
[18:29:41] <shoky> you have that inline <script> tag in your html
[18:29:47] <shoky> that runs:  slider_select_next();
[18:29:51] <southpointingcha> correct
[18:30:30] <shoky> southpointingcha: ah nevermind the 2nd thing
[18:30:34] <southpointingcha> ok
[18:30:38] <runvnc> whirl3d I dunno but what happens if you comment out the ppluginmaker call
[18:30:47] <Whirl3d> ok. console.log($("body")) gives me null
[18:30:51] <shoky> southpointingcha:   "slide-image-"  <--- is wrong
[18:30:58] <shoky> no more hints!
[18:30:58] <southpointingcha> oh
[18:31:01] <southpointingcha> lol
[18:31:20] <southpointingcha> oh!
[18:31:22] <southpointingcha> slider-image
[18:31:23] <southpointingcha> no?
[18:31:24] <shoky> ;D
[18:31:27] <shoky> try it ;p
[18:31:28] <southpointingcha> excellent
[18:31:28] <runvnc> Whirl3d, I mean that and the whirl3d call
[18:31:47] <shoky> (dont forget to click run.. :P)
[18:31:49] <southpointingcha> !
[18:31:52] <southpointingcha> you're the best
[18:31:54] <southpointingcha> thank you so so much
[18:32:00] <shoky> ;D no probz
[18:32:06] <southpointingcha> I greatly appreciate your help shoky and runvnc
[18:32:28] <southpointingcha> i do code thigns that work generally
[18:32:32] <runvnc> whirl3d can you set a breakpoint and step through starting on this line var itm= $(this);
[18:32:33] <southpointingcha> but then there are those times...
[18:32:41] <southpointingcha> going by a tutorial is always tricky
[18:32:41] <shoky> ;)
[18:32:42] <southpointingcha> thank you
[18:32:42] <runvnc> near the top of pluginmaker
[18:32:56] <shoky> yeah learning javascript/jquery would be a good next step(s) ;P
[18:32:57] <runvnc> and before that set a watch on $('#test')
[18:33:12] <southpointingcha> yep, I've just started the codecademy tutorial for javascript
[18:33:18] <shoky> ah neat
[18:33:21] <southpointingcha> i love codecamedy
[18:33:26] <shoky> haven't tried it
[18:33:42] <southpointingcha> i've only really done games (byond) and database stuff before
[18:33:50] <southpointingcha> but my job wanted html and css
[18:33:52] <southpointingcha> so i learned it
[18:34:02] <southpointingcha> next step javascript
[18:34:18] <southpointingcha> then finish php
[18:34:24] <southpointingcha> then... the world!!!! ;)
[18:34:53] <Whirl3d> aha It's the keyword NEW that I kept forgetting. LOL
[18:35:20] <shoky> lol was that it?
[18:36:04] <shoky> hm where else did you need 'new' ?
[18:36:52] <fantasyxdream> hi everybody
[18:37:00] <fantasyxdream> I want to ask some help
[18:38:09] <fantasyxdream> I want to count the day in a month, but you know, mybe there are 6 week in a month, because the start day maybe is the last day in the week before
[18:39:04] <Whirl3d> I still don't get why I can't log an element....I mean how can you do anything if your dev tools arean't working? I need a mac or any machine other than a windows box. wah 8(
[18:39:31] <fantasyxdream> anyone help me
[18:39:48] <fantasyxdream> any one help with the weekly count?
[18:40:10] <Whirl3d> fantasyxdream count the days in a month?
[18:40:28] <Whirl3d> or the weeks in a month
[18:40:43] <fantasyxdream> I want to count the day in a month, but you know, mybe there are 6 week in a month, because the start day maybe is the last day in the week before, and the last day in a week maybe the last day in the next week, so there are 6 week in a month buy how do I math this?
[18:41:04] <fantasyxdream> sorry
[18:41:25] <fantasyxdream> count the week in a month
[18:42:13] <Whirl3d> got it. you could get the week number for the start and end days of each month and subtract them to come up with ho many weeks/month
[18:43:18] <fantasyxdream> I can get these is 25-2012, 25 is the number of the week
[18:43:59] <Whirl3d> number of the week for what? the start day? the end day?
[18:44:18] <shoky> Whirl3d: what can't you log ?
[18:44:32] <Whirl3d> any item in the dom, for starters
[18:44:41] <Whirl3d> nor any variables
[18:44:44] <fantasyxdream> I don't know how to count the start day and the end day in the week
[18:44:49] <Whirl3d> from the console
[18:45:03] <Whirl3d> how are you getting your date information?
[18:45:59] <shoky> Whirl3d: 3 seperate issues in one line and it seems to me your plugin thing is working..
[18:46:03] <fantasyxdream> date("W-Y");
[18:46:14] <shoky> Whirl3d: from:  init.apply(this, $.makeArray(arguments).slice(1));
[18:47:14] <shoky> Whirl3d: to:    _init.apply(this, $.makeArray(arguments));
[18:47:23] <shoky> whoops thats 2, now where was that 3rd
[18:47:34] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/6FGag/14/
[18:47:53] <fantasyxdream> date("W-Y") <-- i get the week number in php like this
[18:48:00] <Whirl3d> but I still can't check the data object for test to see if the plugin is there....because I can't log $("#test")
[18:48:12] <Whirl3d> nor $("#test").data("whirledView");
[18:48:23] <shoky> Whirl3d: ah,  new plugin(this, options);    -->   new plugin(itm, options);
[18:50:01] <shoky> Whirl3d: that firebug shit doesn't show you errors ;)
[18:50:08] <Whirl3d> console.log($("body")) returns null
[18:50:10] <shoky> at least not in your fiddle ;S
[18:50:10] <jherichard> hey, i need to do a replaceWith() without removing the element from the dom so i don't trigger event handlers for remove. is there any way to do that?
[18:50:30] <shoky> Whirl3d: huh i dont get null
[18:50:46] <jherichard> i could append to the parent but then i don't get the same spot
[18:51:26] <Whirl3d> I know. I get it in both firefox and chrome
[18:51:49] <shoky> wait, in the browser's console?
[18:51:54] <Whirl3d> yes
[18:51:59] <shoky> ah, of course, its jsfiddle
[18:52:03] <shoky> its an iframe
[18:52:08] <shoky> with its own document
[18:52:30] <shoky> either log stuff in the js code
[18:52:40] <shoky> well yea.
[18:52:59] <shoky> if you set a breakpoint though, then you can do stuff in the console
[18:53:00] <Whirl3d> I do, and it works fine. Wow. I can't believe this entire time I swear I thought I could do it before. LOL
[18:53:03] <shoky> i think
[18:53:22] <shoky> LoL
[18:54:07] <shoky> Whirl3d: and when that firebug console in jsfiddle is on, you wont see any errors in your browser's console
[18:54:12] <shoky> so beware dat shit
[18:54:42] <Whirl3d> I still can't believe someone hasn't hacked the iframe security bs.
[18:55:13] <Whirl3d> You'd think that someone would have a hacked version of chrome that overrode those protections
[18:55:35] <shoky> that wouldn't be of much help for hackers tho
[18:56:03] <shoky> they'd need other people's browsers to be vulnerable to it ;P
[18:56:40] <Whirl3d> if I could get the source code for some of the shit that loads in an iframe, I'd probably find some fun stuff to do with it.
[18:56:55] <shoky> mm
[18:56:58] <shoky> wat
[18:57:21] <Whirl3d> shoky, if you have to make a gallery script, what plugin do you use?
[18:57:22] <shoky> oh the source code..
[18:57:31] <shoky> you mean serverside code?
[18:57:42] <Whirl3d> sure
[18:57:49] <Inv1s1ble> how do I select all input elements with the name "from_date[]" ?  I tried $('input[name="from_date\\[\\]"')
[18:57:59] <Inv1s1ble> but that doesn't return any elements
[18:58:02] <shoky> er serverside code q was regarding the iframes
[18:58:24] <shoky> uhh about a gallery - no idea, i'd look for neat stuff ;P
[18:58:25] <Inv1s1ble> The input itself is <input type="text" name="from_date[]" ...
[18:58:30] <wookiehangover> nicovalencia: listen to this motherfucker
[18:59:25] <Whirl3d> wookiehangover, say wat?
[18:59:29] <nicovalencia> haha wookiehangover - he's backlogged reading out all the meta crap
[18:59:39] <nicovalencia> haha there it went - jen lol'd
[18:59:39] <wookiehangover> Whirl3d: https://gist.github.com/2879382
[18:59:45] <jherichard> anyone? a way to replicate replaceWith() without removing the original element from the dom?
[18:59:56] <Inv1s1ble> any help please?
[19:00:53] <shoky> Inv1s1ble:  $('input[name="from_date[]"]')
[19:01:15] <Whirl3d> herichard, what are you talking about?
[19:02:41] <Inv1s1ble> shoky, Thanks!
[19:03:10] <jherichard> Whirl3d: is there a way to replace an element in the dom without removing it like replaceWith() does?
[19:03:22] * shoky squints
[19:03:50] <jherichard> i need to move an element somewhere else without removing it, because that calls remove event handlers, and i want to replace it with a different element.
[19:04:06] <shoky> jherichard: .detach() ?
[19:04:38] <shoky> ?detach
[19:04:39] <bot-t> .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[19:04:45] <shoky> oh hi bot-t
[19:05:22] <jherichard> well i can move the original element to it's new place in the dom fine, i just don't know where to insert the replacement element afterwards
[19:06:21] <shoky> jherichard: wherever the other one was, no?
[19:06:43] <jherichard> i think my problem is that i don't know how to describe that location
[19:06:51] <shoky> bot-t: def is It boils down to this: if you make a (proper) jsfiddle of what you've already tried, someone will definitely (try to) help you
[19:06:53] <bot-t> shoky, "is It boils down to this: if you make a (proper) jsfiddle of what you've already tried" is not in the dictionary.
[19:07:01] <shoky> fack u
[19:07:17] <shoky> bot-t: definitely is It boils down to this: if you make a (proper) jsfiddle of what you've already tried, someone will definitely (try to) help you
[19:07:18] <bot-t> shoky, Stored "definitely".
[19:07:19] <jherichard> i could just insert the replacement element right after the original, then move the original?
[19:07:38] <shoky> jherichard: sure
[19:11:12] <jherichard> cool thanks!
[19:39:37] <jgspratt> hi.  I have this problem with this code: http://hastebin.com/buqekitoqu.lisp : it fires three click events when I load the page, but what I wanted was to use first variation listed on http://api.jquery.com/click/
[19:39:59] <jgspratt> how can I fix this problem so that the update_hidden() is only fired after I click the relevant IDs?
[19:44:28] <tomasm-> hi what could cause a input[type=submit] to not submit a form (ie input.click() does nothing), and yet form.submit() works?
[19:44:46] <tomasm-> I don't believe there are event handlers on the buttons
[19:46:20] <tomasm-> the form tag has no 'action', but it does have a 'submit' handler
[19:56:00] <shoky> tomasm-: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/gD5VL/
[19:57:24] <shoky> jgspratt: remove the ()  , you're calling update_hidden when you do update_hidden()
[19:57:49] <shoky> jgspratt:  -->  .click(update_hidden);

[20:12:25] <systemfault> Use a pastebin next time
[20:12:30] <danieljamesbertr> my success function returns NOTHING when I do this.
[20:12:51] <tw2113> you're not passing anything into the function or doing anything to display the data
[20:13:04] <danieljamesbertr> no I know that
[20:13:26] <tw2113> so you know your issue
[20:13:30] <tw2113> and are asking anyway
[20:13:36] <shanky_ty> sfdhhgh
[20:13:37] <danieljamesbertr> NO
[20:14:22] <tw2113> success: function(data)
[20:14:32] <tw2113> and then inside the function, console.log(data)
[20:14:36] <danieljamesbertr> That was not code that I was using.... just to talk to you guys about. what parameters in the success function hold the HTTP response headers/ returned HTML?
[20:14:55] <shoky> the docs tell you all of that, i thought
[20:15:19] <systemfault> danieljamesbertr: Also.. your web inspector should show you everything from the request/response
[20:15:34] <danieljamesbertr> yes I see that in Firebug.
[20:15:52] <danieljamesbertr> I get a 200 Ok but nothing else.
[20:16:00] <systemfault> Headers?
[20:16:23] <systemfault> Is CORS enabled?
[20:17:47] <danieljamesbertr> this is what I absolutely have to find out. (If CORS is enabled)
[20:18:18] <shoky> no headers?
[20:18:46] <tw2113> personally i want to see the actual code you're using, not an example paste
[20:18:55] <danieljamesbertr> the response headers that come back just give me a PHP session cookie.
[20:19:44] <shoky> why async:false ?
[20:20:11] <systemfault> lawlz.
[20:20:24] <systemfault> Why he is using a callback then o_O
[20:20:40] <shoky> so thats why its empty!!
[20:20:55] <danieljamesbertr> Hey I just started javascript last week. Give me a break.
[20:21:00] * systemfault whistles the final fantasy fanfare
[20:21:20] <danieljamesbertr> that code is not what I use!
[20:21:22] <shoky> danieljamesbertr: ok from here on out don't use async:false
[20:21:31] <shoky> and don't go near people that do :P
[20:21:38] <shoky> they smell like tuna
[20:22:12] <shoky> did i overdo it
[20:22:19] <danieljamesbertr> I am asking for guidance on the proper way to ensure I get data when doing a jQuery post, cross-domain. That is why I am here. How can I ensure this.
[20:22:43] <systemfault> You pray.
[20:22:44] <shoky> the only way to ensure you get data is to get it..
[20:22:46] <danieljamesbertr> If you are a cat then they smell pretty good!
[20:23:06] <systemfault> That's pretty much the only thing left to do… since you're not giving us something to work with..
[20:24:43] <shoky> danieljamesbertr btw did you try what tw2113 said:  success: function(data) { console.log(data) }
[20:24:50] <danieljamesbertr> ok it is a REST style API that uses GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to create, manipulate and destroy resources.
[20:25:17] <tw2113> good ole passing data into the function
[20:26:23] <rodd> Say you have a popover plugin, what's the best scenario? 1) Insert the popover container with data defined by user and leave it in the dom for (possible) later use (as display none) - 2) Insert popover and then remove it from dom after closing - 3) use a single popover container, update its content for each popover (on user interaction)
[20:26:36] <shoky> 4) profit$$$
[20:27:24] <rodd> ?
[20:27:49] <systemfault> danieljamesbertr: Cool story bro...
[20:28:05] <systemfault> danieljamesbertr: Is there any way you could set up a test we could "see"?
[20:28:22] <shoky> rodd: definitely not 2 unless you've got a lot of them
[20:28:39] <shoky> rodd: and im not sure i understand the diff between 1 and 3
[20:29:53] <rodd> shoky well yeah there isnt much difference, you'd leave the markup for each popover on 1), then u'd just show again on user interaction
[20:30:10] <rodd> on 3) you'd need to update its content
[20:30:21] <rodd> maybe that could cost
[20:31:00] <rodd> you'd end up doing less manipulation i guess
[20:31:38] <shoky> mmm yea so either 1 or 3 depending on how much different popovers you can end up showing
[20:31:46] <shoky> i guess
[20:32:53] <shoky> oh i forgot its for a plugin
[20:33:03] <shoky> too sleepy.
[20:39:48] <procrastubator_> So if I were to change the text of a <li> , and right after an event finishes, I set the source of the <li> to be an image, shoudl this work?
[20:39:57] <procrastubator_> Right now, the text stays even after the event finishes
[20:40:17] <procrastubator_> I'm unsure if I implemented badly or that's not supposed to work
[20:40:18] <systemfault> The source of the  <li> ?
[20:40:32] <procrastubator_> systemfault: What about the source of the <li>?
[20:41:32] <procrastubator_> systemfault: Oh sorry, as in image source src
[20:41:35] <systemfault> procrastubator_: Hmm.. forget it.. Show me the code. (Use a pastebin)
[20:42:23] <procrastubator_> Sure thing
[20:42:49] <procrastubator_> Before posting it, this is what I was trying to do: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1219679/765409
[20:44:19] <systemfault> Can't see any <li>s
[20:44:31] <procrastubator_> http://jsfiddle.net/F8Zmw/1/
[20:45:04] <procrastubator_> Well, no, but I figure the source could be changed like it was in the link
[20:45:33] <procrastubator_> Also, look at only the first hover button, I'm still working on the second
[20:46:39] <systemfault> $(this).src("images/telephone.png"); <-- bad
[20:47:21] <systemfault> It would be something like: $(this).find('img').prop('src', 'theimagehere.png');
[20:47:55] <procrastubator_> Let me try that
[20:55:01] <prefixed> has anyone in here worked with the jPlayer before?
[20:59:58] <Bernie711> hi guys, am getting some jquery validation, am not sure where it has came from :s could anyone tell me what it is? it appears for the email input
[21:02:06] <systemfault> What? :/
[21:03:15] <Bernie711> lol
[21:03:21] <Bernie711> www.highaccess.nl/contact.php
[21:03:56] <Bernie711> if u enter invalid email data, u get a jquery popup,  i dont know why that is appears, i did not ask for the visual
[21:04:50] <systemfault> 404 :/
[21:04:57] <Bernie711> wat
[21:05:15] <Bernie711> www.highaccess.nl/contact.php
[21:05:23] <Bernie711> isnt that what i wrote :s
[21:05:43] <systemfault> I cannot access that URL.. perhaps it's my connection.
[21:05:47] <Bernie711> np
[21:06:10] <systemfault> Bernie711: What is the markup for that element?
[21:06:41] <Bernie711> the jquery popup?
[21:06:47] <systemfault> No, the <input>
[21:06:56] <systemfault> For the email
[21:07:12] <tw2113> it may be php based
[21:07:18] <Bernie711> email
[21:07:27] <systemfault> Bernie711: type="email" ?
[21:07:32] <tw2113> this? http://www.highaccess.nl/img/error.png
[21:07:32] <Bernie711> yeah
[21:07:38] <Bernie711> no tw
[21:07:45] <systemfault> Bernie711: Then it's your browser's native validation..
[21:07:48] <Bernie711> type=email
[21:07:55] <Bernie711> thank god
[21:08:01] <tw2113> ah
[21:08:04] <tw2113> gotcha
[21:08:06] <tw2113> i see now
[21:08:14] <Bernie711> i was thinking i dont remember setting that up
[21:08:28] <tw2113> welcome to html5 form elements
[21:08:35] <Bernie711> i like it
[21:09:12] <Bernie711> can it be disabled to use own popupts?
[21:09:15] <Bernie711> popups
[21:09:24] <systemfault> That.. I don't know
[21:09:54] <Bernie711> wats your view on captcha ?
[21:10:04] <Bernie711> security input data
[21:10:13] <Bernie711> i personally hate them
[21:12:48] <systemfault> They seem like a necessary evil..
[21:13:07] <Bernie711> they scare users awa
[21:13:08] <Bernie711> away
[21:13:41] <systemfault> Like I said… necessary evil.
[21:14:02] <systemfault> You prefer to have bot flooding you with new accounts?
[21:14:03] <tga> hello
[21:14:09] <systemfault> Hi
[21:14:11] <someprimetime> i've got a number that is changing to negative and positive on each mousewheel but i'd like to just cast all of them to positive numbers.. best way to do this?
[21:14:16] <tga> jquery mobile question: the f
[21:14:22] <systemfault> someprimetime: Math.abs
[21:14:28] <someprimetime> systemfault: thanks man that was quick
[21:14:41] <systemfault> ?eval [Math.abs(10), Math.abs(-10)];
[21:14:43] <bot-t> systemfault: [10, 10]
[21:14:48] <someprimetime> so good :D thanks
[21:14:56] <tga> the first time I changePage(), the location hash changes but the framework doesn't pick that up
[21:15:01] <tga> any idea what would cause this?
[21:15:16] <systemfault> Sorry, never used jQ mobile
[21:15:17] <Bernie711> cant we set a simple catcha
[21:15:23] <Bernie711> posing a question to the user
[21:15:31] <systemfault> Bernie711: Simpler for you… simpler for the bots
[21:15:36] <Bernie711> 1 + 3 =
[21:15:52] <Bernie711> so they add 4 to the input, or is that not good enough?
[21:16:06] <systemfault> Bernie711: Do you think a "computer" who can do billions of calculations per second cannot find that?
[21:16:14] <Bernie711> so i need a capthca on my contact form?
[21:16:27] <Bernie711> damn it
[21:16:28] <systemfault> Not really
[21:16:42] <Bernie711> i do not want bots spamming
[21:16:48] <Bernie711> as you said :(
[21:16:59] <systemfault> Bernie711: Spamming a contact form?
[21:17:08] <systemfault> It's going to happen anyway
[21:17:33] <systemfault> What you don't want are bots creating fake accounts and use them for malicious purposes.
[21:18:49] <Bernie711> so just use capthca with memberships
[21:18:59] <Bernie711> user registration
[21:19:11] <systemfault> I wouldn't personally use a captcha on a contact form :)
[21:19:14] <systemfault> Yeah..
[21:19:22] <Bernie711> another on the do list
[21:19:41] <systemfault> Even if you get spam… You should already have a spam filter on your mail server :P
[21:19:47] <Bernie711> would u just have validation with php for contact form?
[21:19:54] <Bernie711> yeah has spam filter:)
[21:20:02] <Bernie711> its so good it filters out the non spam too
[21:20:10] <Bernie711> pain in the arse
[21:20:36] <systemfault> :/
[21:20:51] <Bernie711> users can enter ratings, i cant imagine that having a capture
[21:21:07] <Bernie711> am preventing against sql injection
[21:21:26] <Bernie711> so am hoping that is alrite
[21:21:28] <systemfault> You should do that serverside..
[21:21:48] <Bernie711> using php
[21:22:13] <systemfault> Ok...
[21:22:31] <systemfault> Then validate everything… use prepared statements, etc..
[21:22:49] <maja> how does one take jquery serlised data and unserlize it with php
[21:23:11] <systemfault> maja: Using a format that both language understand… JSON
[21:23:15] <Bernie711> gonna haev a fiddle with some code for abit then goto slepe
[21:23:19] <Bernie711> thanks for your time
[21:23:21] <otherj> maja: did you even google that?
[21:23:23] <systemfault> Bernie711: :)
[21:23:24] <otherj> SO has like 5000 results
[21:23:28] <Bernie711> take it easy
[21:31:03] <maja> otherj: i did but not a good string
[21:50:05] <Whirl3d> I like the human computation validations.  The ones where they give you a word problem that is really simple, but requires you to respond in a way that only a human would. It's light on security but I went from about 500 bounced spam messages a week to 0 after I added it.
[21:51:15] <ndss56> Whirl3d: is there a jquery plugin for it?
[21:53:33] <Whirl3d> not that I have seen. my favorite is the one where you have to drag an element from one spot to the other...On a recent law site, I had a user drag a gavel onto the gavel pad to show they were human
[21:54:47] <Whirl3d> the dragging effect is easy to tell if it's a human or machine effecting the dragging. If it's a human an dthey have gone to all the trouble of entering spam in your form, it's not a real threat.
[21:57:21] <ndss56> Whirl3d: I would like to implement something like that. Where do I start?
[21:57:54] <Whirl3d> what is the context of your form? What kind of client is it? What industry?
[22:00:22] <ndss56> Whirl3d: Context: user_login; E-commerce
[22:00:28] <rubyglow> hi all
[22:00:29] <rubyglow> using jquery I want to open a URL as pop and when accessing the website in  pop , the jquery should capture the request and reponse passed in pop window
[22:00:40] <Whirl3d> okay, what industry?
[22:00:40] <rubyglow> is that possible to do in jquery
[22:01:09] <Whirl3d> that's not possible due to sop
[22:01:15] <Whirl3d> ? SOP
[22:01:16] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[22:01:43] <ndss56> Whirl3d: Industry: Toys
[22:01:47] <tw2113> woo, MDN links
[22:01:58] <Whirl3d> Perfect!
[22:03:25] <Whirl3d> so, you could have a series of 3 images of cute toys, one household blende, and a trashcan. Your line would read: Drag the element inappropriate for children to the trash.r
[22:03:52] <Whirl3d> that would be hard to simulate as a bot
[22:04:07] <Whirl3d> or better yet
[22:04:31] <Whirl3d> you could have a set of batteries on the left and 3 images of stuffed animals and one electric race car.
[22:04:42] <Whirl3d> Drag the batteries to the toy that requires batteries
[22:05:33] <ndss56> Whirl3d: I get the concept and example now. How do I implement this?
[22:05:51] <Whirl3d> simple enough using jquery UI and draggable and droppable
[22:06:43] <Whirl3d> make all the images draggable, but only make the one droppable. It enters a value in a hidden field based on successfully dropping the batteries on the droppable
[22:06:55] <ndss56> Whirl3d: Are you able to mock-up that example on jsfiddle for me please?
[22:07:25] <Whirl3d> Hmmm....you mean would I be willing to do your job for you?  I'll think about it. LOL
[22:08:27] <ndss56> Whirl3d: I'm new to jquery, and I particularly like the battery example.
[22:10:14] <prefixed> Could someone in here explain why my .trigger() code on line 195 of jplayer.js is not executing properly on the following page: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[22:10:42] <prefixed> the content should be shifting to the next page once the last player halts play
[22:16:04] <eladk> hwllo
[22:16:28] <eladk> somone can help me with plugin dataTable?
[22:21:15] <prefixed> if I replace .trigger('click') with .hide(), the element is hidden as expected
[22:23:01] <Whirl3d> ndss56, I'm working on it. It's quite a bit of work though. Here are the images I picked..you'll want to use images that are transparent...
[22:23:11] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/ZkFZQ/4/
[22:23:34] <ndss56> Whirl3d: I appreciate it. Let me take a look.
[22:24:10] <prefixed> this is hilarious, I can use trigger() in the console, and use hide() inline, but I can't use trigger() in the code. what in the actual fuck?
[22:24:30] <ndss56> Whirl3d: All images look good.
[22:25:19] <ndss56> Whirl3d: Umm.. you can't make it transparent in JQuery or CSS?
[22:25:31] <prefixed> why did yall break jquery?
[22:26:22] <systemfault> Lawlz
[22:29:38] <rubyglow> hello
[22:29:54] <rubyglow> using jquery I want to open a URL as pop and when accessing the website in  pop , the jquery should capture the request and reponse passed in pop window
[22:30:31] <prefixed> is this the correct way of using trigger()? ($('.view').find('.pager-next a')).trigger('click');
[22:33:32] <Whirl3d> imo, if you tell your browser to close (or any mf application for that matter). it should close...immediately...not when it feels like it
[22:33:36] <Whirl3d> now
[22:47:34] <prefixed> Could someone in here explain why my .trigger() code on line 195 of jplayer.js is not executing properly on the following page: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[22:47:52] <prefixed> the content should be shifting to the next page once the last player halts play
[22:48:02] <prefixed> if I replace .trigger('click') with .hide(), the element is hidden as expected
[22:55:59] <Whirl3d> I'm drawing a blank on how to get droppable to work.
[22:56:08] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/ZkFZQ/27/
[23:00:03] <Whirl3d> seriously, you expect someone to look through ALL That code...Drupal even, and see if they can find where your binding for the click event on element is failing? seriously. That's why you get paid the big bucks.
[23:02:07] <prefixed> DUPLO!
[23:02:11] <Whirl3d> And here's another thing: your classes are minimized, making it impossible to help
[23:02:20] <prefixed> I'll give you the relevant code
[23:02:21] <prefixed> one sec
[23:02:57] <prefixed> http://pastebin.com/ZVVZYxjc
[23:03:10] <prefixed> Whirl3d none of those work when executed in the code
[23:04:04] <Whirl3d> just use click()
[23:04:11] <prefixed> actually, no. The code in /* */ sorta works, but it appears to omit the ajax rendering
[23:04:40] <prefixed> Whirl3d click() doesnt work
[23:04:55] <Whirl3d> there is no "pager-next" if it is the last page, right?
[23:05:34] <prefixed> yes, but we're on the first page in this instance, and click() works if i call it in console
[23:05:45] <Whirl3d> try console.log("your selector for page-next a".attr('disabled'));
[23:05:54] <Whirl3d> or .prop('disalbed'); is more appropriate
[23:06:18] <prefixed> Whirl3d I have already tried the hide() method. it works as expected
[23:06:46] <Whirl3d> what does that have to do with it being disabled?
[23:08:32] <Whirl3d> you don't have a "nextpage function or something?
[23:08:33] <prefixed> $('.view').find('.pager-next a').prop('disabled');
[23:08:33] <prefixed> TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'prop'
[23:09:27] <Whirl3d> console.log($(sel).attr("href"));
[23:10:11] <prefixed> $('.view').find('.pager-next a').attr('href');
[23:10:11] <prefixed> "/main?page=1&js=1&view_name=main_content&view_display_id=default&view_args=&view_path=main&view_base_path=null&view_dom_id=12&pager_element=0"
[23:10:14] <Whirl3d> console.log( $('.view').find('.pager-next a'));

[23:11:05] <RonWhoCares> My question is at this web page
[23:11:37] <prefixed> Whirl3d both of those last commands work
[23:11:49] <Whirl3d> so prefixed, rather than pushing the click handler, just load the page from the href attr
[23:12:16] <prefixed> Whirl3d how do I do something liek that?
[23:12:22] <tw2113> RonWhoCares why not use CSS?
[23:12:28] <phoenixson> <phoenixson> has any had problems with the nivo slider in Firefox?
[23:12:38] <Whirl3d> location.href= $('.view').find('.pager-next a').attr('href');
[23:13:02] <prefixed> Whirl3d that reloads the entire page
[23:13:12] <RonWhoCares> tw2113: I don't know how I would; The input is loaded based on the user's decision.  It is specific to the decision.  This is why I am loading it "after the fact"
[23:13:19] <Whirl3d> what were you wanting to do?
[23:13:38] <tw2113> ah
[23:13:49] <Whirl3d> because presumably clicking the link would do the same
[23:13:55] <prefixed> Whirl3d go to the bottom of the page and click "Older Entries >" http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[23:14:12] <prefixed> only a portion of the page is reloaded
[23:15:04] <prefixed> running the code within jplayer.js doesn't work, but running the code (i.e. $('.view').find('.pager-next a').click();) in the console on that page works
[23:15:33] <prefixed> Whirl3d do you see what I mean?
[23:15:42] <prefixed> there is something extremely strange occuring here
[23:15:44] <Whirl3d> maybe you need to fix the errors first
[23:15:57] <prefixed> those two errors are nto relevant to the code in question
[23:16:19] <Whirl3d> there are four in my list
[23:16:24] <prefixed> what four?
[23:16:26] <RonWhoCares> I am trying to make a jquery delete
[23:17:30] <prefixed> Whirl3d pastebin the errors please
[23:17:32] <Whirl3d> also, i have no idea what the problem is. It appears to load fine
[23:18:16] <prefixed> Whirl3d I need the page to shift when the final track on the page completes playing
[23:18:46] <prefixed> if you play the last track on the page (it's five seconds long), you'll see that nothing happens
[23:19:06] <prefixed> aside from some console output that displays that the functions aren't breaking
[23:19:15] <Whirl3d> pastebin sux ass I swear. It's the only service that I can't log into for some fucked up reason.
[23:20:31] <tw2113> so don't use it
[23:20:35] <Whirl3d> http://pastebin.com/Z0h0Ffpk
[23:22:17] <prefixed> Whirl3d none of those errors are related to the script in question
[23:22:32] <prefixed> see my above comments for information on what *isn't* working
[23:23:42] <Whirl3d> Sorry, I'm not interested in helping you any more. I have my own things to handle and this is really way outside the scope of my skillset. Sorry
[23:24:10] <prefixed> cool. it looks like I've found a bug with jquery
[23:24:58] <systemfault> Cool story bro…. jQuery 1.3.2...
[23:26:39] <prefixed> systemfault the script in question juses the lates stable jquery
[23:26:48] <prefixed> bro
[23:26:48] <caniuse> prefixed: http://cache.gyazo.com/f548b1702e557f4938a4f2fbf1c2b278.png
[23:28:30] <systemfault> $.fn.jquery in the console disagrees with you bro.
[23:29:50] <prefixed> systemfault oh boy, there are two versions of jquery loaded on the site. one for the CMS and one for jplayer.js. I'm really not trying to be a dick here.
[23:30:04] <systemfault> prefixed: They conflict...
[23:30:13] <systemfault> The 1.3.2 one is used.
[23:31:36] <prefixed> systemfault if I use console.log($.fn.jquery) in the script in question, it returns 1.7.2
[23:31:57] <prefixed> now, what is this acout conflicting versions, and what can I do to fix the issue?
[23:32:50] <systemfault> There's jQuery.noConflict for that
[23:33:45] <systemfault> http://blog.nemikor.com/2009/10/03/using-multiple-versions-of-jquery/
[23:33:46] <prefixed> whoa
[23:36:24] <systemfault> I hope it helps… as you really have a conflict ($.fn.jquery) shows 1.3.2 when entered in the console but 1.7.2 when console.log'ed from your code..
[23:38:02] <prefixed> hm
[23:38:06] <prefixed> well
[23:38:34] <prefixed> I think this may be part of the issue
[23:39:05] <prefixed> the "pager" elements are part of the CMS, which uses jquery 1.3.2 (which is a limitation of drupal6)
[23:39:56] <prefixed> can I actually do what I need to do (automate a click on the pager) using jquery 1.3.2 inline with the method you just provided?
[23:40:52] <systemfault> I don't have any experience about dealing with conflicting jQuery versions :(
[23:41:11] <devinceartas> Jquery can't be upgraded in drupal6? Does it break things if you do? I didn't know that
[23:41:22] <systemfault> He probably cannot..
[23:41:32] <systemfault> 1.3.2 is prehistoric.. too much changed since.
[23:41:39] <ryanaz> hey systemfault
[23:41:43] <prefixed> devinceartas it breaks a ton of stuff on the backend
[23:41:43] <tw2113> oh drupal
[23:41:44] <systemfault> ryanaz: Hey :)
[23:41:54] <devinceartas> Bummer
[23:42:06] <prefixed> I would upgrade to drupal7, but this site has far too much custom functionality
[23:42:10] <snover> so many excuses
[23:42:24] <tw2113> i heard drupal is good at breaking upgrades
[23:42:30] <systemfault> ryanaz: What's up with your website?
[23:42:32] <snover> can’t upgrade jquery because it breaks things (even though there is a drupal 6 jquery upgrade module)
[23:42:33] <tw2113> for backwards compat
[23:42:37] <snover> can’t upgrade drupal because it breaks things
[23:42:52] <ryanaz> systemfault:  Going good... got one last thing to punch through and we're done with phase 1...
[23:43:00] <systemfault> Win
[23:43:02] <ryanaz> yup
[23:45:48] <BinaryKitten> there is a drupal module snover that will allow you to use the later ones. the Drupal team at work use it.
[23:46:22] <snover> BinaryKitten: i already said that
[23:46:27] <snover> why are you telling me? :)
[23:46:28] <BinaryKitten> ah sorry
[23:46:36] <snover> WHO DO YOU THINK I AM
[23:47:02] <BinaryKitten> obviously, someone who has amnesia
[23:47:27] <BinaryKitten> otherwise you'd know who you were and who you are and that would be good enough
[23:47:27] <prefixed> it looks like I'm going to have to upgrade drupal if I can't get this working
[23:47:34] <prefixed> what an effing pain in the ass
[23:47:38] <tw2113> snover...what is this?
[23:47:42] <tw2113> think man, think!
[23:49:20] <prefixed> BinaryKitten were you talking about a module which allows for the use of later versions of jquery?
[23:49:33] <BinaryKitten> prefixed i was
[23:50:33] <prefixed> yeah
[23:50:36] <prefixed> I use that as well
[23:51:10] <BinaryKitten> from what i gathered it doesn't upgrade, but run alongside
[23:51:14] <prefixed> exactly
[23:51:19] <prefixed> hence the conflict herein
[23:51:57] <prefixed> I'm praying to the grat computer god that I can just use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/ to fix this issue
[23:53:34] * BinaryKitten gives up trying to be helpful for today and goes to work instead
[23:57:27] <prefixed> how would one actually use jQuery.noConflict() to invoke a different version of jquery?
