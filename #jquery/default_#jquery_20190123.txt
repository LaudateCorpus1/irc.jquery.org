[02:48:36] <devi8> how do you apply values in css for things like transforms? $(this).css("transform","scale(.3)")? or $(this).css("transform:scale",.3)?
[02:54:28] <pavonia> Why would it be the latter?
[02:56:23] <devi8> I guess I was thinking perhaps that the value passed to the css property needed to be a simple data type like string or number. So passing scale(x) would be like passing a function. so why not font-size:scale(3);
[02:57:55] <Cork> devi8: you apply it as a string
[02:58:05] <Cork> "transform","scale()"
[03:17:23] <devi8> thank you. if I say var fontsize=$(this).css("font-size"); fontsize++; $(this).css("font-size", fontsize); doesn't work because css("font-size") returns the "px" as well, is that correct? or is there another issue here?
[03:23:36] <devi8> I have been struggling to find a simple way to resize text to take up it's parent container's width. I tried the resizeText script on gitHub but it didn't work.
[03:24:01] <devi8> So here's the very first attempt on my own. It's ugly and needs a lot of work, but it works! https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/MLYQQR?editors=1111
[05:06:45] <mehalee> yo folks! whats would be the proper way to change a document's  CSS? I need the style to be applied to newly added elements as well.
[05:07:59] <Woet> mehalee: why?
[05:08:40] <Cork> mehalee: you don't want to do that dynamically
[05:08:50] <Cork> it forces the browser to rerender the entire page
[05:09:06] <Cork> it is better to have the css use a class or similar and just add that to the new element
[05:10:08] <mehalee> Cork: so, its better to have some if before inserting element and adding a css class to it?
[05:10:31] <Cork> mehalee: it is better to keep the css document static, yes
[05:10:39] <mehalee> ok, thanks!
[07:31:21] <spinningCat> is there arabic version od datetime picker or should i need to implement by myself
[07:31:23] <spinningCat> https://jsfiddle.net/75fnohmv/
[07:36:04] <Cork> jquery ui should have a locale option
[07:36:22] <Cork> not sure if it exists for arabic (i usually don't use the locale feature at all)
[07:36:47] <spinningCat> implement with your own?
[07:37:22] <Cork> you would have to check what is in the locale database
[07:39:21] <spinningCat> I see
[07:40:01] <spinningCat> it is here https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/datepicker/localization.html
[11:11:38] <jcrawford> hello everyone, I am trying to parse an html document for algolia indexing, I need to be able to get all p after h1 but only after h1 so if I have h1 > p > h2 > p h5 > p p p I would only want to grab the p under h1, how can I do that not knowing what the next tag might be?  I am using nodejs as well with Cheerio for processing.  I thought about nextUntil but do not know what the until would be.
[11:20:49] <jcrawford> is there a way to list multiple elements for the nextUntil such as nextUntil('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6')?  I am basically looking for a way to index with importance weights based on where the paragraph is located.
[11:21:54] <jcrawford> trying to re-create this in nodejs for a static site generated with metalsmith: https://blog.algolia.com/how-to-build-a-helpful-search-for-technical-documentation-the-laravel-example/ but cheerio allows me to use jquery selectors so still trying to figure out the best way to accomplish this
[11:25:11] <pavonia> nextUntil() with multiple alternatives should work
[11:25:59] <pavonia> nextUntil('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6', 'p')
[11:38:10] <jcrawford> let me give that a shot thanks
[11:40:07] <jcrawford> when I use that it appears to select things like h3 > p p p > h3 > p p p so i end up with all 6 paragraphs in one when I would only want the first 3
[11:40:13] <jcrawford> then the second 3 etc
[11:40:43] <jcrawford> jQuery('h3').nextUntil('h2,h3,h4,h5,h6', 'p'); <-- ran that as a test
[11:42:42] <pavonia> Which seems correct. The first query matches all <h3> elements, each of them having multiple <p>s
[11:45:07] <jcrawford> hmm ok
[13:12:04] <r00twrh> I have a select menu with an id of 'myselect'.  From the js console is can do $('#myselect'').html(); and it outputs the current contents... If I do a .empty() on it, it clears (validated by checking .html() again)... but that change is not reflected in the page itself.  Any advice?  I'm using a creativetim bootstrap template that has various other jQuery compnents. When I put the simple js and select into jsFiddle, it works fine.
[13:12:04] <r00twrh> Any help would be GREATLy appreciated!
[13:12:19] <robertmaxrees> can you show =us in a fiddle?
[13:12:30] <robertmaxrees> or some other similar site.
[13:12:39] <robertmaxrees> ah wait
[13:12:58] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id="myselect"]').length)
[13:13:03] <robertmaxrees> what does this output on your page?
[13:13:50] <r00twrh> 1
[13:13:55] <robertmaxrees> on your page?
[13:14:38] <r00twrh> No, in the console.. The contents of the page did not change as result of that... There are still the original 500+ items in the select menu
[13:14:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:15:09] <robertmaxrees> i meant when you run that log against your page and not the fiddle - was just checking.
[13:15:17] <robertmaxrees> so you have bootstrap involved here?
[13:15:21] <r00twrh> Yes
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> did your fiddle include bootstrap?
[13:15:40] <r00twrh> No, it does not
[13:15:45] <robertmaxrees> that may be the issue, then.
[13:15:49] <r00twrh> I'll try to add that to see if makes a difference
[13:25:48] <r00twrh> @robertmaxrees thanks, it was one of the css classes from the template that was preventing the change
[13:25:54] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:26:28] <r00twrh> huge help!  thanks
[15:47:10] <Forbidd3n> Is it possible to convert a block jQuery draggable item to text so I can insert it as html to a wysiwyg editor?
[15:47:25] <robertmaxrees> convert to text or convert to inline?
[15:50:32] <Forbidd3n> hi again robertmaxrees. I'm still trying to get this to work.
[15:50:39] <robertmaxrees> get what to work?
[15:50:48] <Forbidd3n> I need to insert the draggable item to the point of where the mouse drops it
[15:51:03] <robertmaxrees> weren't you using telerik?
[15:51:08] <Forbidd3n> Currently it just appends it to the bottom of the content
[15:51:10] <robertmaxrees> and the answer was that you can't do what you want?
[15:51:30] <Forbidd3n> no, I was using the issue as though it is relevant to my issue
[15:51:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:51:48] <Forbidd3n> I have tried TinyMCE, CKEDitor and Jodit
[15:52:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:52:09] <Forbidd3n> The link I posted yesterday was a link explaining the same concept as my issue
[15:52:35] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) sorry, having a hard time remembering exactly what the issue was.
[15:52:48] <robertmaxrees> either way - i don't think jqui will be able to support what you want easily.
[15:53:16] <Forbidd3n> This was my example - https://jsfiddle.net/blupointmedia/g3szd715/13/
[15:53:39] <Forbidd3n> I need to drag and item to the content area and drop it where my pointer is
[15:54:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, dunno that you're going to be able to really do that without some heavy lifting.
[15:55:42] <Forbidd3n> I thought about using a canvas, but then I would have to allow for editing of text objects and I would have to store all object in an array with coordinates to save to db
[15:57:14] <robertmaxrees> fyi that fiddle doesn't work.
[15:57:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a7zu1ngx/ this fixes the issue.
[15:59:08] <Forbidd3n> umm my fiddle worked fine for me
[16:00:34] <Forbidd3n> ahh it is https://jsfiddle.net/blupointmedia/g3szd715/14/ not /13/
[16:02:27] <taplar> i'd be tempted to not use a table for this
[16:02:58] <taplar> i'd think it would be easier to have the two columns as divs that were each drop zones
[16:03:03] <Forbidd3n> taplar: I am trying to create a html builder with drag and drop database fields to store in db to create reports
[16:03:48] <taplar> doesn't really mean that the presentation of the build has to match the output
[16:05:04] <Forbidd3n> either way, with or without table. I need to figure out how to drag and element and drop it where the mouse lets it go
[16:05:31] <Forbidd3n> kind of like if you grab anything on a webpage and drag it to the table you will see the cursor and allow you to drop it in that location
[16:05:44] <taplar> exactly where the mouse drops?  As in if they drop down the table, past the total number of rows, it should still drop in that exact place?
[16:06:32] <Forbidd3n> using my example you would drag the draggable element to the drop area and drop it where the mouse clicks to drop it
[16:07:33] <taplar> exactly where it drops
[16:07:54] <Forbidd3n> when the user let's go of the draggable item
[16:08:18] <Forbidd3n> where the user let's go of the draggable item
[16:08:24] <Forbidd3n> lets
[16:08:28] <Forbidd3n> ugh can't type today
[16:08:29] <taplar> yeah, just at a glance that's fairly involved.  because you are going to have to calculate where it dropped, how that relates to the total number of table rows needed to put it there, and all that
[16:08:57] <Forbidd3n> no it should just drop it there. forget the tables
[16:09:19] <taplar> so assume you remove the table?
[16:09:23] <Forbidd3n> for example click the logo on the left and drag it to the table and you will see a cursor and it will drop it there
[16:15:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pcqotj89/ is sorta it, though I can't see the draggable now
[16:28:56] <Forbidd3n> taplar: it doesn't drop it where the mouse lets it go
[16:29:57] <taplar> I assume it is, but the point of your arrow is at the top left of the element that is added.  So the text is down and right of it.
[16:34:47] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/cwaxtm5L/  yeah, thats' what it is
[16:38:56] <Forbidd3n> taplar: I need it to go inline with the text. If you add a bunch of text to the canvas and then grab the blue and white logo on the top right and drag it inside of the text you will see what I mean
[16:39:56] <taplar> i don't see any logo.  all i see are item 1-3
[16:40:31] <Forbidd3n> the top right of browser the jsfiddle icon
[16:40:37] <Forbidd3n> well the user icon top right
[16:40:49] <Forbidd3n> just drag that down into the contenteditable area
[16:41:10] <taplar> you're wanting to drag the jsfiddle icon onto the droppable element in your fiddle?
[16:41:51] <Forbidd3n> yeah so you can see what I mean by placing it where it is dropped and it continues to be draggable and droppable
[16:42:27] <taplar> the jsfiddle icon does not drop in the area for me, and I wouldn't expect it to.  jsfiddle wouldn't know that your dropzone exists
[16:44:18] <Forbidd3n> ugh it works if you just drag it and drop it in the drop zone areaa
[16:44:20] <Forbidd3n> area
[16:44:38] <taplar> not for me
[16:44:47] <robertmaxrees> taplar i think they mean youir user icon
[16:44:49] <robertmaxrees> from the top right
[16:45:15] <taplar> i'm not logged in so i don't have one, so i can't test that
[16:45:30] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[16:45:49] <taplar> in any case, this change shows a potential way of using the event layerX/Y to know where to potentially position the element that is dropped
[16:48:50] <robertmaxrees> iirc inline elements should do what they want without extra js.
[16:51:01] <taplar> hmm?
[16:51:47] <Forbidd3n> this is frustrating to me, sorry :/
[17:12:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/q4b29oat/  now it's centered.  not sure what robert is referring to if there is an easier way
[17:13:20] <robertmaxrees> from what i can tell, Forbidd3n wants to drop into a text field and have the object drop at where the mouse drops it.
[17:13:43] <Forbidd3n> correct, but not over top of the text. I want to push it inline with where it drops
[17:13:51] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:14:28] <taplar> drop into a text field?  like an <input type="text"> ?
[17:14:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[17:14:40] <taplar> eeeegh
[17:14:53] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:14:59] <Forbidd3n> no not drop into a text field
[17:15:06] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:15:09] <Forbidd3n> taplar: do you see a logo add on the bottom left?
[17:15:12] <robertmaxrees> oh a contenteditable, right?
[17:15:31] <taplar> no
[17:15:35] <Forbidd3n> you can drag that in the contenteditable and you will see what I mean, but first add text to the contenteditable
[17:16:47] <Forbidd3n> when you are dragging it over the text you can see the cursor moving with the mouse on where to drop it if you drop it in the middle of the text it will push the image in the middle of the text
[17:16:49] <Forbidd3n> inline
[17:17:08] <Forbidd3n> I meant a logo add on the bottom left
[17:17:13] <Forbidd3n> a Carbon ad
[17:17:17] <robertmaxrees> so just to ask the obvious question
[17:17:26] <robertmaxrees> why use jquery ui for this?
[17:17:28] <Forbidd3n> a logo ad, can't type worth a sh*t today
[17:17:28] <taplar> ok, i see the behaviour on https://jsfiddle.net/blupointmedia/g3szd715/14/
[17:17:42] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I am open to suggestions
[17:18:22] <Forbidd3n> I just need to be able to create a drag and drop template with db fields (end result) store in db to generate reports or pdf's from it
[17:18:31] <Forbidd3n> What would you suggest?
[17:19:15] <Forbidd3n> canvas and svg seem to be a little overkill for my end result I think
[17:19:26] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14678451/precise-drag-and-drop-within-a-contenteditable
[17:19:36] <robertmaxrees> lots of reading material coming up with a google search.
[17:19:40] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I have tried that, it doesn't seem to work
[17:19:52] <Forbidd3n> at least not for cross-browser
[17:20:00] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that jquery ui draggable isn't the right tool for this job.,
[17:20:31] <lurkashflake> $('#submit').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); return false; }); when I click submit the page reload, I want to prevent the form from submitting
[17:20:53] <robertmaxrees> lurkashflake show us a fiddle?
[17:21:06] <robertmaxrees> ah wait - is #submit the button itself?
[17:22:04] <lurkashflake> yes
[17:22:14] <robertmaxrees> that's why - you need to bind that listener to the form.
[17:22:20] <lurkashflake> :) thank you
[17:22:25] <robertmaxrees> the submit event is emitted by the form, not the button :)
[17:22:51] <taplar> though that brings up the question of why you're cancelling the form submit
[17:23:03] <robertmaxrees> ajax submission maybe? :)
[17:23:43] <lurkashflake> stopping the form from sending is the first step before adding validation that trigger it to not send on false
[17:24:13] <taplar> you mean to trigger it to send on true
[17:24:45] <lurkashflake> yes
[17:24:56] <taplar> k
[17:26:11] <taplar> you're also going to validate on the backend, yes?
[17:27:30] <taplar> @ lurkashflake
[17:31:56] <taplar> non-denial is confirmation
[17:32:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:33:08] <taplar> how goes it?
[17:33:38] <robertmaxrees> eh.  it's going.  some not-so-wonderful things happening in my personal life.  just trying to move forward.
[17:34:46] <taplar> ah, sorry to hear that
[17:35:00] <taplar> continuation of the drama, i take it?
[17:35:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  the ex is trying to get more money.  pulling some other stuff, too.
[17:35:34] <robertmaxrees> just wanna be done with it all and move on.
[18:04:04] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees / taplar: any other suggestions on what I could use?
[18:05:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/q0ghLypw/1/
[18:05:27] <robertmaxrees> so why can't you just do this?
[18:08:29] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: it could work, but the element I am dragging has attributes I need to add to a the dropped element.
[18:09:28] <robertmaxrees> "i need to add to a the dropped element" - why for?
[18:09:57] <Forbidd3n> I have data attributes I need to pass with the dragged item and append to the dropped item
[18:10:06] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:11:01] <robertmaxrees> any other requirements?
[18:11:22] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: sorry. I didn't put them all, but since the concept is changing there are a few
[18:11:44] <robertmaxrees> so i would back up and look at the bigger picture.
[18:12:37] <Forbidd3n> My end result.. I have a draggable item. It is a database column, I drag it to the area and drop it, I need to make that dropped item draggable within the editor so I will be making it not selectable so the element stays contained
[18:12:57] <robertmaxrees> wait back up.
[18:13:20] <robertmaxrees> so you need a drag and drop that you can, say, order?
[18:13:39] <robertmaxrees> so you're dragging and dropping these items and ordering them in relation to each other, right?
[18:13:44] <Forbidd3n> So draggable item would be Customer First Name and when dropped it turns to {{Customer.FirstName}} which is draggable within the content area as well
[18:14:15] <robertmaxrees> right, but there won't actually be freeform text in this control, just these column names.
[18:14:18] <Forbidd3n> I am building a pdf template that will later be read in and variables (like twig) would replace it with data
[18:14:40] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[18:14:44] <Forbidd3n> yes, there is freeform text. They can add images and headers/footers and so one and plugin variables
[18:15:02] <robertmaxrees> so you're really building a drag and drop WYSIWYG webapp
[18:15:35] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: well I am up for using what is already out there. I am currently using Jodit Editor
[18:15:38] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[18:15:54] <Forbidd3n> and that is creating the editor in a contenteditable field
[18:15:57] <Forbidd3n> div rather
[18:16:17] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[18:16:37] <robertmaxrees> you've got your work cut out for you.
[18:16:54] <Forbidd3n> I just need the damn drag and drop concept to work :)
[18:17:23] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that's not really doable using something like jquery ui.  what you're building is actually kind of complex.
[18:17:37] <robertmaxrees> it'd be easier to have buttons to insert those placeholders instead.
[18:18:21] <Forbidd3n> not sure I follow you
[18:18:45] <robertmaxrees> instead of a drag+drop paradigm, have buttons to insert those "columns" instead.
[18:19:02] <robertmaxrees> or find some other way to handle that interaction.
[18:19:19] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you're looking at some hacks to get this working
[18:19:27] <Forbidd3n> ok so I can make the list items clickable, but how do I determine where to place it in the contentarea and the user will have to drag it around if they want to move it
[18:19:57] <robertmaxrees> and even then it won't be perfect since the WYSIWYG and the PDF could differ in final presentation.
[18:20:24] <Forbidd3n> the wysiwyg is just html and most pdf creators except html
[18:20:30] <Forbidd3n> it should come out correctly
[18:20:44] <Forbidd3n> I have worked with this concept in the past. I am only having issues with the damn drag and drop
[18:20:48] <robertmaxrees> there's a good chance it won't since rendering engines all behave differently but meh.
[18:20:53] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[18:21:07] <robertmaxrees> there's a ton of hits on google for "insert element at cursor contenteditable"
[18:21:36] <Forbidd3n> questions or solutions...? I have seem many questions, very little solutins

[19:34:26] <DopeBacon> I'm attempting to consume a third-party API that authenticates users by reading the api key, and another key, from the URL parameters. I would like to create some client side code that utilizes the API, but they keys give access to some other endpoints that I definitely don't want a malicious user to make use of. Is there a service or a simple way to proxy these requests where I can hide the API key and only provide access
[19:34:26] <DopeBacon> to endpoints that won't harm the third-party service I'm using? I know it can be done in node (a server), but I'll be doing this for multiple people with different API keys and I don't think it will be worth hosting a node service for each of these people who are paying a one time fee. Any suggestions?
[23:51:17] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: you still around?
