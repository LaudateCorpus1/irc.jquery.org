[06:29:23] <seven-eleven> hi
[06:29:53] <seven-eleven> what method should i use to read an html fragment from a string to a dom tree so I can use find() or closest() method on it
[06:30:16] <seven-eleven> the string looks like: <div class="some-class"> .... </div>
[06:45:20] <ThijsW> Hi is there anybody out here?
[06:47:04] <Uhkis> nope
[06:56:37] <ThijsW> damn
[07:10:25] <ThijsW> I'm directing to page2.html with javascript: window.location.href ("page2.html") but the ajax load icon shows and then everything hangs
[07:13:17] <Woet> ThijsW: did you check your console?
[07:50:16] <ThijsW> I'm checking the console... just a sec.
[07:56:47] <ThijsW> jquery-1.11.1.min.js:4 XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///D:/Thijs/Documents/Development/Phonegap/PBI/PB%20Indicator/www/index.html?radio-choice-h-2=on. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https.
[07:56:53] <ThijsW> this shows up when i hit the button
[07:57:02] <ThijsW> in the console
[08:09:54] <ThijsW> I'm also getting lots of jquery.js errors
[08:09:55] <ThijsW> jquery-1.11.1.min.js:4 [Deprecation] Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
[08:12:25] <Uhkis> ThijsW: you need a webserver for ajax calls
[08:16:13] <ThijsW> I know, It's on my NAS to try it out. I have removed a timeworker.js script, now the buttons work ? no idea how/why
[08:40:11] <sine0> so im a noob and a few month back i made a little js calculator with jquery which works well, however the output updates only when you click off of the selection window, such as the input box. the dropdown boxes are ok because the action of selecting through them updates, however im finding that some users click the button and the outputs have not updated because there is still an input selected
[08:40:33] <sine0> $('#g_edge').on('change', function(e) {
[08:40:35] <sine0> etc
[09:45:23] <April[m]> dead?
[10:06:29] <cannap> what
[10:08:38] <April[m]> I'm looking for a way to get the time elapsed from 1970
[10:08:57] <April[m]> the typical way gives the unix timestamp, which doesn't count leap seconds, and thus is behind what it should be
[10:09:09] <April[m]> so I'm wondering if there's a way to get atomic/TAI time
[10:09:22] <April[m]> or maybe fetch from a list somewhere that has leap seconds counted out
[10:16:45] <cannap> https://time.is/de/ :P
[10:16:52] <cannap> https://time.is
[10:18:48] <cannap> just use new Date() - what you need
[10:18:53] <cannap> i dont understand it 100% sry
[10:26:37] <April[m]> new Date() grabs unix time, which is currently 27 seconds slow
[10:26:59] <April[m]> I made that mistake while originally writing my code
[10:28:08] <April[m]> I don't see any way of correcting unix time on time.is, nor any way to get what I need through jquery/js
[11:12:27] <rizonz> hi guys

[14:30:46] <Dejavu86> Hi, i'm looking for a way to write an if-query to the value of an name-attribute. The query always goes in the else branch.
[14:30:46] <Dejavu86> https://pastebin.com/F0QarqTd
[14:58:26] <ahoo> in my function i pass an optional array of options. how do i merge an object that has default values with the passed in options overriding defaults?
[14:59:57] <ahoo> lol never mind :D
[17:52:56] <thoraxe> https://gist.github.com/thoraxe/af9360bd1f4c2b9011b97711ee7b4b8b ok, i am really not understanding what's going wrong here... seems like jquery is loaded, but not?
[18:01:08] <thoraxe> i feel like this is a super basic error
[18:05:08] <thoraxe> aha it was the slim jquery
[18:05:09] <thoraxe> ok
[18:05:15] <thoraxe> now i probably need a "server"... sigh
[18:09:04] <thoraxe> so i guess this is a dumb question but if I'm just minimally messing with html/js is there something even less than apache I can use to "serve" this stuff?
[18:11:53] <thoraxe> jquery grabbing files from the filesystem doesn't seem to work
[18:12:20] <April[m]> you can use pure html/js and host on ZeroNet
[18:12:44] <April[m]> no need to worry about backend servers, hosting fees, uptime, etc
[18:13:14] <April[m]> albeit, your site can only be accessed by people on zeronet, or through a proxy
[18:33:00] <thoraxe> yeah i just ran apache
[21:49:50] <tumble4ya> hi all, my vmouseup event is not firing
