[01:27:52] <red82> hi there.  I’m working on a e-commerce store and I’ve run into a jquery related issue.  I have two modules each of which bundle their own minified jquery, and one is a different version than the other, which is obviously bad.  I’m in the process of updating the modules so that only one gets added, but in the meantime, is there a downside to making the minified files be identical?
[01:31:33] <Guest13669> is it magento?
[01:36:39] <whoisaCe> Question, I want to check if one of two variables exist, then use the one var that does exist, how can I do that?
[01:42:24] <Cork> whoisaCe: is the variable global?
[01:42:32] <red82> Guest13669: yes
[01:43:20] <Cork> red82: the risk is that the plugin isn't compatible
[01:43:33] <Cork> but ya, scripts bundling jquery is really bad
[01:43:56] <red82> Cork: its (possibly) affecting the checkout, which is worse than the plugin not working
[01:43:59] <Cork> i would recommend filing a bug to the creator to at least produce a version without it
[01:44:48] <whoisaCe> Cork: Yea I think so, it's coming from the dataLayer.
[01:44:49] <Cork> (and for some weird reason this is most commonly a problem with internet shop plugins...)
[01:45:08] <Cork> dataLayer?
[01:45:32] <Cork> whoisaCe: could you create a jsfiddle with the snippet where the variable is set?
[01:45:40] <Cork> (doesn't have to work)
[01:45:44] <whoisaCe> sure
[01:48:35] <Guest13669> i would try and find another module #magentopurgatory
[01:49:06] <whoisaCe> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/0skotne3/
[01:49:27] <Cork> whoisaCe: ah, those aren't globals
[01:49:34] <Cork> are you use the "var" exists?
[01:49:58] <whoisaCe> Well the Arrays are from the dataLayer
[01:50:05] <whoisaCe> https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/reference
[01:50:12] <Cork> those are objects not arrays btw
[01:50:32] <whoisaCe> yes, correct sorry
[01:51:34] <Cork> whoisaCe: while i write an example you could try if window.cart_List or window.product_List gives you the variable
[01:51:41] <Cork> if it does things becomes much easier
[01:54:00] <whoisaCe> Cork: nope undefined, guess not
[01:54:09] <Cork> pitty
[01:54:11] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/0skotne3/1/
[01:55:06] <Cork> whoisaCe: if it would have been on window: https://jsfiddle.net/0skotne3/2/
[01:56:18] <whoisaCe> What's the difference between type_of and typeof
[01:56:25] <Cork> opps typo
[01:56:30] <Cork> it should be typeof
[01:56:46] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/0skotne3/3/ <-- this is another option if you can modify the variable structure
[01:56:48] <whoisaCe> yea was wondering, never seen type_of xD
[01:56:51] <Cork> :)
[01:56:55] <Cork> too much ruby :/
[01:58:20] <whoisaCe> Hehe, magic - but yes, thank you, I understand bit more now, I starred the examples for future references.
[04:01:06] <dminuoso> Hi. So Im using bootstrap and I'm collapsing some elements like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9cbca640fef4691b79af2bbb2ae5b799 // It works nicely, until you toggle the checkbox while the collapse animation is happening. I get "hiccups" where suddenly the checkbox is checked, but the element not collapsed.
[04:01:22] <dminuoso> (Or the other way around, where the checkbox is unchecked, but the element remains uncollapsed)
[04:08:20] <effsss> hey can someone help me understand the req, res , i'm readin a lot of examples about it but dont really get it, why do we need it?
[04:09:48] <shoky> effsss: req, res  is usually seen in node.js code, not jquery..  it's the http request and response objects (used to read stuff from the request, and write stuff to the response). you probably want #Node.js :p
[04:26:03] <Sourcey> Im having trouble setting min and maxDate on jquery datepicker. It shows both wrong year and dates. Anyone know this? https://jsfiddle.net/mo93cnjj/
[04:29:04] <dminuoso> Sourcey: So look at the format you used in the strings, and the string format you specified.
[04:29:07] <dminuoso> Look at it real hard..
[04:29:56] <Sourcey> if u mean yy - datepicker outputs yyyy, so it seems to have no effect. I have also tried to change it
[04:33:27] <doublel93> hey there,  I have this code  https://jsfiddle.net/rgqmwjzh/ , it's not assigning the on click function to my element,  but if I open the web console and paste the same command, then it assigns it, someone knows why would this happen ?
[04:33:31] <dminuoso> Sourcey: Look at it again, closely.
[04:33:51] <dminuoso> Sourcey: The formats simply don't match.
[04:34:17] <dminuoso> Sourcey: yy is correct, as it just means 4 digit year.
[04:34:33] <Sourcey> lol, yes i see it now. facepalm
[04:34:48] <Sourcey> thx
[04:35:00] <dminuoso> Be glad Im not an SAP consultant, or this would have cost you $4,500.
[04:35:49] <Sourcey> How can I update the value dynamicly?
[04:35:57] <shoky> doublel93: could be many things... could be jquery was not included yet, could be wrong selector, could be the DOM is not ready yet, could be the element does not exist yet.. etc.  make a jsfiddle showing the problem if you want more help
[04:36:18] <dminuoso> doublel93: The question is when do you install the event handler..
[04:36:31] <doublel93> on document.ready
[04:36:38] <doublel93> gonna check about the jquery not included yet
[04:36:45] <dminuoso> doublel93: Does the element exist at that time?
[04:37:15] <doublel93> it should exist on document.ready right ?
[04:37:19] <dminuoso> doublel93: How should I know.
[04:37:22] <dminuoso> I dont know your website.
[04:37:40] <doublel93> I'm lacking knowledge here, on document.ready shouldn't everything be loaded ?
[04:37:46] <dminuoso> doublel93: No.
[04:37:52] <dminuoso> doublel93: document.ready is when the DOM is ready.
[04:37:53] <shoky> everything that was in the initial html, yes
[04:38:11] <dminuoso> doublel93: But JavaScript can modify the DOM afterwards freely and modify it.
[04:38:12] <shoky> those elements would exist, that is
[04:38:20] <doublel93> yeah sorry for lacking the detail, there is nothing dinamically added
[04:38:40] <dminuoso> doublel93: A very simple example: you have a button that triggers some ajax, and when done it inserts that element in the DOM tree. No document ready event will get fired.
[04:38:42] <doublel93> gonna make it a complete fiddle
[04:41:33] <doublel93> here it is,  https://jsfiddle.net/feud2327/1/
[04:42:14] <dminuoso> doublel93: So at least have the courtesy and delete these commented out blocks of code..
[04:42:31] <shoky> doublel93:  so, wrong selector?
[04:43:07] <shoky> oh sorry nevermind
[04:43:20] <dminuoso> doublel93: https://jsfiddle.net/feud2327/2/
[04:43:21] <doublel93> dminuoso: I'm really sorry, I have 4 other tasks that I'm doing almost simultaneosly and rushing because of an important presentation, will clean it in a sec
[04:43:22] <dminuoso> Your fiddle sucks.
[04:43:23] <dminuoso> It works.
[04:43:37] <dminuoso> Try my version out.
[04:44:34] <doublel93> ok so for you it works, for me still doesn't
[04:44:47] <doublel93> it means for sure that is the camera video code that is causing the problem, thanks a lot
[04:45:02] <dminuoso> Nice, making assumptions already.
[04:45:12] <shoky> doublel93 you can check the devtools network tab and see if the request is sent or not..
[04:46:28] <doublel93> shoky: the last request is the videocamera one, hanging there for 10-15sec, problem found
[04:46:30] <doublel93> thanks a lot
[04:47:35] <shoky> always reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle first
[04:48:24] <doublel93> shoky: I don't know how I would go about it, the camera is local
[04:48:25] <dminuoso> Or better yet, use git to its strengths and prepare the test case on your local environment where it's much faster.
[04:48:49] <dminuoso> (Creating a testcase on jsfiddle can be hairy)
[04:49:14] <dminuoso> Just delete code until the problem disappears. You often immediately then find the cause. ;-)
[04:49:51] <doublel93> well now I'm confused because even with the video loading problem now works, and I didn't change anything in the code
[04:50:54] <doublel93> anyways learned a lot from this experience =p
[04:51:36] <dminuoso> doublel93: Is your source code versioned?
[04:52:15] <doublel93> nope, this is something started today, to have web page control a remote light
[04:52:20] <doublel93> for a presentation on monday
[04:52:21] <BulleTTime> hi, i use jquery $.get to get a html document. however when i do anything with the returned html $(html) the browser starts resolving the resources like images etc.
[04:52:29] <BulleTTime> how can i prevent that?
[04:52:31] <dminuoso> doublel93: Then gitify it.
[04:53:01] <dminuoso> BulleTTime: Not pass it to $() ?
[04:53:28] <BulleTTime> dminuoso: how can i then use filter :) ?
[04:54:20] <BulleTTime> or do anything with the html string..
[04:55:15] <shoky> you can try $.parseHTML
[04:57:14] <BulleTTime> shoky: what would solve that ?
[05:38:30] <effsss> what does it mean when a series of functions are connected with by dots
[05:39:50] <decx> it's called spread
[05:41:07] <effsss> it was like var x = function().functionb().functionc()
[05:41:40] <decx> well function gives you back something that has a functionb which gives you back something that has a function c
[05:42:36] <effsss> what do i call this would like to read up more
[05:42:44] <decx> chaining
[05:44:39] <effsss> thanks! wasn't getting any search results
[05:47:21] <effsss> i'm reading about it here: http://schier.co/blog/2013/11/14/method-chaining-in-javascript.html  if you set something up for method chaining does that mean the regular method bob.setName('Bob'); won't work because its returning "this"?
[05:48:17] <effsss> or the return just disappears?
[06:53:18] <momomo> clickin on two elements directly after each other, seems to cancel the first, $e$.find('>[item=channels]').click(); $e$.find('>[item=remote]').click();
[06:53:31] <momomo> the first one is never actually clicked
[06:54:11] <momomo> trigger is behavind the same way
[06:54:45] <momomo> this is wierd, because you would expect to be able to bind methods at one place and use the element to trigger them were you need
[06:54:59] <momomo> as a method call and they would have the same context and arguments
[07:04:30] <AdamPDotty> strange things going on there :-)
[07:04:40] <AdamPDotty> $e$ is jQuery?
[07:05:14] <AdamPDotty> starting with '>' does not seem obvious to me.
[07:06:15] <AdamPDotty> Then if both handlers influence the same elements, I would not expect a chronological order of manipulation.
[07:12:12] <momomo> yes
[07:12:44] <momomo> no, it is the child elements of the $e$ ... to find ..
[07:12:52] <momomo> the click is on different elements
[07:13:05] <momomo> with a setTimout to zero .. it works fine
[07:13:17] <momomo> but it is a bit strange
[07:15:13] <AdamPDotty> if you want a child use .children() not .find()
[07:15:43] <momomo> anyhow .. not the problem right now thouhg :)
[07:16:04] <AdamPDotty> and maybe you want element1.click().then(function (){element2.click();});
[07:57:47] <jose3_> anyone here ever use lynx ?
[07:59:10] <slax0r> the teerminal browser? sure
[07:59:14] <slax0r> terminal*
[08:46:18] <mooru> Hello guys. is there a way to get the react kind of DOM update of an element with jquery
[08:56:37] <bomb> mooru: Virtual DOM? None that I know of. Virtual DOM being faster than actual DOM is a myth, FYI.
[09:38:11] <jose3_> slax0r like you really use it? or you've used it ?
[10:02:30] <BulleTTime> hi, how do i check if a user can see an element ?
[10:02:53] <BulleTTime> (sometimes its not visible as the user needs to scroll down..
[10:10:50] <krisppp> hey guys... in a situation where, in a cms, I can't use #anchors in a URL. Can I use javascript to transform a query string to an anchor?
[10:14:39] <jose3_> is there a cleaner way to write this without the inclusion of additional libraries ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bea5cc58ebacbf1c626f70146b11f775
[10:17:42] <krisppp>  I can't do http://www.domain.com/#anchor but I could do http://www.domain.com/?goto=anchor - could I use js to make it have the same effect?
[10:42:11] <momomo> if I need to scroll a container to an element position .. element.offset().top seems relative to the scrollbar ... is there a way to get the desired value to use for container.get(0).scrollTop = ??
[11:06:03] <taplar> jose3_: i started looking at your snipplet, but two things stuck out at me as errors
[11:06:22] <jose3_> yes ?
[11:06:32] <taplar> at the beginning and end of your each your conditionally appending a starting div and ending div
[11:06:57] <taplar> when you append with jquery it appends dom nodes, so the closing tag doesn't make sense, and the first open div will automatically be closed
[11:07:29] <taplar> it's not appending the 'text' your giving it
[11:07:59] <jose3_> index === "confirm2" ? $("#tag-based-data").append("</div>") : null;
[11:08:09] <jose3_> so this is not being made or it is making an extra one ?
[11:08:11] <taplar> ya, that doesn't make sense
[11:08:26] <taplar> not sure how jquery would treat that
[11:08:35] <taplar> but the first one is definately being auto closed
[11:08:47] <taplar> as i said, it appends dom nodes, not html
[11:09:30] <jose3_> ohhhm i didnt know that. Ill look into it now
[11:09:31] <jose3_> thanks
[11:09:52] <taplar> other than that issue, i would suggest you could use a template for your record to make your script a little smaller.  you could do so without an extra library
[11:11:00] <taplar> i'll throw together a little snipplet to show
[11:22:03] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/e1zd4x98/
[11:23:50] <taplar> i think it was decx who had a smaller version of that once
[11:32:42] <BulleTTime> hi, anyone knows a good subscribe plugin?
[11:33:05] <BulleTTime> so id like to inform people when the site is changed
[11:37:20] <BulleTTime> is there anything more outhere rather then the jetpack subscriptions?
[11:54:19] * taplar does the half day dance
[11:55:49] <jose3_> hmmm
[11:56:04] <jose3_> taplar: thanks Im looking at it meor
[11:56:06] <jose3_> w
[11:56:13] <taplar> cool
[11:56:26] <jose3_> Ohh i see
[11:56:40] <taplar> if you like that, that's a basic thing, but (it would be another plugin) handlebars does that and more
[11:56:52] <taplar> or mustache
[11:56:52] <jose3_> thats kinda what I was hoping for, something like that without all the +
[11:56:59] <taplar> :)
[11:57:22] <jose3_> this is neato
[11:57:28] <taplar> yeah, we do that some where we are creating things and don't want the markup in the scripts
[11:57:48] <taplar> if you wind up doing it a ton, i'd recommend one of those libraries
[12:05:44] <docmur> What is the right away to find this element: $("img[data-reactid='".0.6.1.0.0.0.1.1.0.1.$xx.1:$6.0.0.0"']").html()
[12:06:43] <taplar> filter would probably be better
[12:07:22] <taplar> $('img').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('reactid') === ''; })
[12:24:34] <iamawesome> Hi, what is websocket? What can i do with websocket? When do i need websocket?
[12:24:53] <iamawesome> Can someone please answer?
[12:25:11] <taplar> websockets are a protocol that browsers can use the create persistent sockets between clients and the server
[12:25:39] <taplar> it allows for a free flow of messages between the client and the user without user interaction
[12:25:40] <iamawesome> What is persistent socket?
[12:25:46] <taplar> a socket that stays open
[12:26:35] <iamawesome> Is websocket allowed/permitted by all browser?
[12:26:50] <taplar> i can't speak to that, but the major browsers should support them
[12:28:02] <robertmaxrees> http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets
[12:29:47] <taplar> is there a ##web ?  might be a better quesiton for some room like that
[12:31:46] <taplar> as far as when do you need them
[12:32:04] <taplar> websockets are ideal when you want your server to be able to push out changes to the users
[12:32:34] <taplar> the easy use case example would be a chatroom such as this
[12:32:35] <iamawesome> taplar: Server means apache server?
[12:32:45] <taplar> any server that supports websockets
[12:34:23] <taplar> websockets start off as a normal http request that gets upgraded to a ws request.  so the server has support/understand that upgrade process
[12:35:08] <iamawesome> taplar: How can i know if a server like apache supports websocket or not?
[12:35:24] <taplar> google is a good resource, :)
[12:40:48] <iamawesome> Is it possible to make websocket with jquery?
[12:41:04] <taplar> define 'make'
[12:42:13] <iamawesome> Creating websocket.
[12:42:22] <taplar> jquery can be used on the frontend to open websocket connections, manage them, and process message.
[12:42:51] <robertmaxrees> iamawesome you should check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API
[12:43:01] <robertmaxrees> there are also tons of other great resources out there for them.
[12:43:23] <taplar> all of which require that the server supports websockets
[12:43:29] <jquery564> What does it mean if your conditionals are being ignored?
[12:43:44] <robertmaxrees> jquery564 you have a formatting problem usually.
[12:43:44] <taplar> define 'ignored'?
[12:43:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:44:04] <taplar> lol, looks like i'm going to be the question a question guy today, ^_^
[12:44:10] <robertmaxrees> :D
[12:44:18] <robertmaxrees> it's a good thing ot be.
[12:44:20] <robertmaxrees> *to
[12:44:37] <jquery564> I am trying to append 2 different buttons, 1 if the my nav has a class, and the other if the class isn't them. It always just serves up my 'else' statement no matter what
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> show us the code.
[12:44:51] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle.
[12:44:56] <taplar> and/or debug your if
[12:45:34] <iamawesome> "WebSockets is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server." which server is it talking about?
[12:45:38] <iamawesome> robertmaxrees: ^
[12:45:49] <robertmaxrees> iamawesome have you tried searching google?
[12:46:12] <iamawesome> robertmaxrees: google about server?
[12:46:20] <taplar> it's whatever server the website is on
[12:46:20] <robertmaxrees> iamawesome about how to make a server that supports websockets.
[12:46:48] <iamawesome> Normally i put php website on apache web server.
[12:47:01] <robertmaxrees> "server" in this case is referring to both.
[12:47:02] <robertmaxrees> the combo.
[12:47:09] <taplar> you put it on the server, that has apache running on it
[12:47:11] <robertmaxrees> http://socketo.me/
[12:47:49] <jquery564> So it works on my jsfiddle... but not on site
[12:47:53] <jquery564> here is my code: https://jsfiddle.net/pyL3qd9g/
[12:48:12] <taplar> do you have duplicate ids?
[12:49:02] <taplar> console.log($('[id="hs-nav-v3"]').length);
[12:49:09] <robertmaxrees> i love that trick.
[12:49:24] <taplar> i'm always afraid peeps will take that and use it as an actual selector
[12:50:05] <jquery564> I've already tried to do it using length? :c
[12:50:17] <taplar> no, run that in your console on your site
[12:50:20] <taplar> what does it log?
[12:50:40] <iamawesome> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API , here under Tools, i see most of them are related to node.js, why is this?
[12:50:52] <taplar> node was one of the first to implement websockets
[12:51:00] <robertmaxrees> iamawesome ask in one channel at a time.
[12:51:08] <robertmaxrees> stop bouncing back and forth between here and ##javascript.
[12:51:18] <taplar> or go ask around in #web
[12:51:33] <robertmaxrees> he's already getting help in ##javascript getting what he needs.
[12:51:38] <taplar> ah
[12:51:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:51:46] <taplar> so he's off topic in two places, ^_^
[12:51:51] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[12:51:59] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[12:52:05] <jquery564> it returns 1 on a page that I'm logged in
[12:52:10] <taplar> cool
[12:52:24] <jquery564> returns 1 on the page that would have the signed out class
[12:52:30] <robertmaxrees> good.
[12:52:33] <taplar> so if it always fails, then i'd say it never has that class
[12:52:37] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:52:40] <robertmaxrees> use a console.log()
[12:52:54] <jquery564> I'm looking at it in inspect right now and it definitely has that class :s
[12:52:56] <robertmaxrees> and log out the .prop('class') of the element before the if.
[12:53:36] <jquery564> <div id="hs-nav-v3" class="external-nav  nav-width-flex with-app-dropdowns single-product current-product-marketing signed-out-nav"> </div>   is in the inspect
[12:53:46] <robertmaxrees> bro
[12:53:58] <robertmaxrees> console.log() the .prop('class') before the if.
[12:53:59] <robertmaxrees> check that.
[12:54:03] <robertmaxrees> you might be surprised :)
[12:54:06] <jquery564> trying now
[12:56:42] <jquery564> console.log('$("#hs-nav-v3").prop("signed-out-nav")'); returns "$("#hs-nav-v3").prop("signed-out-nav")" like 30 times :o
[12:56:51] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[12:56:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked.
[12:56:57] <robertmaxrees> .prop('class')
[12:57:03] <robertmaxrees> not the classname.
[12:57:05] <jose3_> taplar: oh you structured the data differently as well
[12:57:11] <robertmaxrees> but the actual word 'class'
[12:57:18] <jquery564> Oh haha my mistake
[12:57:21] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:57:46] <taplar> jose3_: just for the demo for you
[12:57:54] <jquery564> console.log('$("#hs-nav-v3").prop("class")');    just to make sure, run this. correct?
[12:58:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:58:13] <robertmaxrees> make sure you actually see the class in there.
[12:58:23] <Uhkis> just remove the apostrophes
[12:58:36] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.
[12:58:46] <robertmaxrees> console.log($("#hs-nav-v3").prop("class"));
[12:59:04] <jquery564> oops, yeah just caught on it was just printing the string :S
[12:59:53] <jquery564> Both pages return "nav-width-flex placeholder-nav"
[13:00:03] <jquery564> logged in or not
[13:00:23] <robertmaxrees> so do they have the class you're looking for?
[13:00:29] <jquery564> Nope
[13:00:36] <robertmaxrees> so there's your problem :)
[13:00:55] <jquery564> The class is in it through inspect element though/
[13:00:56] <jquery564> ?
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> that means it's getting added after the fact.
[13:01:11] <robertmaxrees> that means that when the code runs, that class isn't there.
[13:01:22] <robertmaxrees> the js won't magically re-run or anything.
[13:03:20] <jquery564> So I need a way to run the code once $('.signed-out-nav').length?
[13:03:27] <robertmaxrees> what's adding that class.
[13:04:05] <jquery564> I'm not sure, it's on our main JS file. it's used to see whether someone is logged in or not. if logged in, a new nav is generated w/o that class
[13:04:16] <robertmaxrees> right, so you need to modify that main JS.
[13:04:19] <robertmaxrees> to call this code.
[13:04:52] <jquery564> Alright, I'll look into it, thanks for the debugging help guys!
[13:04:59] <robertmaxrees> a-hyup
[13:09:21] <jose3_> taplar: ok i implemented that, thanks!
[13:10:02] <pqnst> hey guys , i started learning jquery so i am trying to add titles from my json , but i can't match images to be above text... currently it looks like this : https://gyazo.com/087d0816c71bba4a83ef2e9bedfcc249 ,  which is bad... code is here : https://jsfiddle.net/00ksjefr/2/ .... anyone :) ?
[13:14:04] <jquery709> Just wanted to loop back in here, I fixed it by using "$(window).bind("load", function() { });" which admittedly, isn't the most elegant, but can work for the time being
[13:14:07] <robertmaxrees> lol waited almost 60 seconds before leaving hahaha
[13:14:13] <robertmaxrees> jquery709 that'
[13:14:22] <robertmaxrees> *that's not a good idea, but alright.
[13:14:47] <jquery709> I know it's not the best, but is load time the only thing bad about it?
[13:15:12] <robertmaxrees> you also can't guarantee that the binding will happen before, that the other code will happen after, etc.
[13:15:24] <robertmaxrees> why can't you modify the main app?
[13:16:13] <jquery709> It's a weird set up, my team is web-team, they are app team. I pinged them on hipchat but haven't heard back yet lol
[13:16:26] <robertmaxrees> so then wait?
[13:16:41] <robertmaxrees> it'd be muuuuch better to do this "the right way"
[13:16:57] <robertmaxrees> why can't you make the change yourself?
[13:17:05] <jquery709> Yeah but our page is life so I atleast need something working so customers dont get trapped in a loop or sent to the wrong place
[13:17:20] <jquery709> I dont have write permissions on app files, only web
[13:17:39] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:17:58] <robertmaxrees> wait you guys don't just like, ad-hoc push changes live do you?
[13:17:59] <jquery709> liv*
[13:18:08] <jquery709> live*
[13:18:17] <robertmaxrees> either way, if you really need to use window load, use $(window).load()
[13:18:27] <robertmaxrees> and avoid .bind() these days unless you're using an ancient version of jquery.
[13:18:55] <jquery709> We do, but I can't push live on their server. The nav is generated in our product, so on the app. Then using a custom server code, is placed on the web page lol
[13:19:06] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[13:19:09] <robertmaxrees> that sounds so weird.
[13:58:17] <hwdyki> how can i use jquery to set the selected value of a select box?
[13:58:35] <hwdyki> tried $( "#id" ).val( xxx ) didn't work.
[13:58:38] <taplar> val() will get you the value of the select
[13:58:38] <robertmaxrees> use .prop()
[13:58:53] <robertmaxrees> oh a select box.
[13:58:59] <taplar> oh, set
[13:59:09] <robertmaxrees> use .val() and set it to the val of whetever you want to be selected.
[13:59:16] <taplar> you can use val() to set it, it just has to match the value="" of an option
[13:59:47] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:00:24] <taplar> yay, my half day begins!  later all!  :)
[14:06:07] <AwkwardCough> lucky guy
[14:06:28] <mooru> Hello guys. I am trying to implement the functionality on this site (http://alpha.org/watch/) with jquery. When the vidoes are clicked. IS there any plugin?
[14:06:37] <robertmaxrees> what functionality?
[14:06:49] <robertmaxrees> that expando thing?
[14:07:38] <mooru> pls see the site. when the image is clicked it plays in the top header video. like a DOM update thingy
[14:07:54] <robertmaxrees> i did see the site - i wasn't clear what you were looking to accomplish.
[14:08:35] <robertmaxrees> looks like they're animating a box in there.
[14:08:40] <mooru> when you click on one of the images it play a video on the same page instead of a different url
[14:08:44] <mooru> yes
[14:08:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  pretty simple to build yourself.
[14:09:12] <mooru> yikes.... bafffled
[14:09:28] <robertmaxrees> open your element inspector and check it out.
[14:09:40] <robertmaxrees> look for the element with the ID alpha-overlay
[14:09:48] <robertmaxrees> watch that when you open the vide.
[14:09:50] <robertmaxrees> *video
[14:10:11] <mooru> it seems to have some javascript thats not available in chrome dev tools sources
[14:10:22] <robertmaxrees> that's... not possible :()
[14:10:24] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[14:10:57] <robertmaxrees> there's a handler bound to .play-video that runs Site.alphaOverlay.open();
[14:11:05] <robertmaxrees> in watch.js
[14:13:10] <mooru> for some reason i can't open watch.js
[14:13:23] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[14:14:35] <mooru> reading the contents of the file thats is
[14:14:44] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[14:15:32] <mooru> ok. just saw it.
[14:18:05] <robertmaxrees> a whirlwind of excitement.
[14:18:59] <mooru> you can say that again
[14:23:15] <lulul> <a rel="next" href="/app_dev.php/admin/list/2">Next&nbsp;»</a> how can i execute some js code on this but without sending the user to that page ? D  i tried with e.preventDefault() at the end of the method but it didn't work still sends me to the href attribute
[14:23:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:23:32] <robertmaxrees> you mean run the actual page?
[14:25:10] <lulul> robertmaxrees when i click next it sends me to that link =D but i would like to stop that event and run the code from my function which would replace the content with an ajax
[14:25:20] <robertmaxrees> you need an event listener.
[14:25:23] <robertmaxrees> show us what you tried.
[14:28:30] <lulul> http://notey.it/n/dGcy
[14:28:58] <lulul> and in ready function i call it like $(document).on('click', 'a.next', getPagination);
[14:29:26] <lulul> getPagination actually means nextPage() :D my bad
[14:29:38] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[14:29:52] <lulul> no errors
[14:30:14] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure the class selector is right?
[14:30:23] <robertmaxrees> try moving that preventDefault() call to the top.
[14:31:29] <lulul> same =D
[14:31:35] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle then.
[14:42:34] <taplar> mmm, i'm waiting for the day that we tell someone to go make a jsfiddle and they end up making a competing website
[14:44:21] <jonez> taplar, greetings
[14:44:28] <taplar> yo yo
[14:44:37] <jonez> do you have that problem often?
[14:44:49] <taplar> which one?
[14:45:03] <jonez> telling someone to do <x> and they wind up making a competing website
[14:45:25] <taplar> not yet, but a person can dream, :)
[14:45:32] <jonez> is that a goal? ;)
[14:45:38] <taplar> y not
[14:45:52] <jonez> you dream about an employee breaching their NDA?
[14:45:58] <jonez> or non-compete?
[14:46:08] <taplar> i dont follow
[14:46:47] <jonez> perhaps I'm making too many assumptions
[14:47:03] <jonez> I am a business owner. I know about an NDA and the "non-compete clause" it often contains
[14:47:15] <taplar> lol, dude it was a joke
[14:47:35] <jonez> so for you to say you dream about someone being told to make a jsfiddle and they wind up making a competing website is a little.. troubling :)
[14:47:44] <taplar> -_-
[14:47:49] <jonez> no hate
[14:48:21] <jose3_> right yeah seeeee
[14:48:36] <taplar> if we're going to get technical, how would an NDA keep a person from making a jsfiddle like site?
[14:48:49] <taplar> they'd have to work for jsfiddle
[14:48:53] <taplar> and an NDA be present
[14:49:19] <jonez> I am bound by at least one NDA
[14:49:27] <jonez> one of them is from 15 years ago
[14:49:49] <taplar> NDA's typically apply strictly to the area you work for, from my understanding
[14:49:50] <jonez> my question is... what causes someone to honor that type of contract?
[14:50:02] <taplar> and NDA for like.... macy's, would apply to doing something for Jcpenny
[14:50:08] <taplar> but not for like.... Lego
[14:50:13] <taplar> they don't sell the same stuff
[14:50:38] <jonez> ah
[14:51:24] <jonez> I do info systems
[14:51:58] <jonez> I talked to my client about the NDA I bound by, and he said I cannot do *anything* like what is in the original contract
[14:52:05] <taplar> sure
[14:52:21] <taplar> well, i'm probably question that
[14:52:29] <jonez> which is a bummer because the concept is brilliant and somebody should get it to work.
[14:52:30] <taplar> s/i'm/i's
[14:52:30] <b-ot> Correction, <taplar> well, i's probably question that
[14:52:33] <taplar> crap
[14:52:56] <jonez> s/i's/I'd/
[14:52:56] <b-ot> Correction, <taplar> well, I'd probably question that
[14:53:01] <taplar> :D
[14:53:04] <jonez> :)
[14:53:08] <taplar> what kind of info systems?
[14:53:16] <Uhkis> that joke escalated quickly
[14:53:21] <taplar> heh
[14:54:12] <taplar> info systems like database development?
[14:54:42] <jonez> all hats.. front end (js, etc), backend (php), tools (python), database (postgresql)
[14:54:58] <jonez> I am learning django
[14:55:00] <taplar> but did you use those, or contribute to their actual source?
[14:55:16] <jonez> I wrote my own php-based framework called "bbsengine"
[14:55:34] <taplar> did you write it while working for that other company?
[14:55:42] <jonez> actually now in v3
[14:55:47] <jonez> no
[14:56:00] <taplar> is it in direct competition with that their business was?
[14:56:12] <jonez> bbsengine was written before I knew that company. also it is important that he is ok with my open source projects and even funded a couple of them
[14:56:47] <jonez> I did not say I have a competing project, I said that I have an NDA that prevents me from writing anything like what is in the original contract
[14:57:12] <jonez> aka "a competing project"
[14:57:30] <taplar> ah, ok.  it kinda sounded like you were saying they were claiming the nda prevented you from writing anything in the languages you used before
[14:57:40] <taplar> which is why i was asking if you had contributed to source, :)
[14:58:01] <jonez> no. I am prohibited to write anything close to what is in that NDA
[14:58:09] <taplar> sure
[14:58:16] <jonez> the project never went production
[14:58:23] <jonez> the customer went out of business
[14:58:42] <jonez> er... my customer's customer went out of business
[14:58:58] <taplar> but you still wrote it for your customer, so they still own it, used or not
[14:59:22] <jonez> taplar, granted. my relationship with my customer is solid. he trusts me not to break the NDA
[15:01:23] <jonez> taplar, I don't get to implement a similar concept
[15:01:34] <jonez> even if I wrote it "from scratch"
[15:01:36] <taplar> right
[15:01:57] <jonez> it bums me out but I'm ultimately ok with it
[15:03:55] <jonez> taplar, have you heard of something called jquery.smoothstate?
[15:04:08] <taplar> nope
[15:05:40] <taplar> seems like an animation like plugin
[15:05:41] <jonez> it's a full page transition plugin.. a bit of a hack, but really cool for UX
[15:08:26] <taplar> lol, is it sad on some of the examples i feel like they're trying to turn websites into powerpoint slides?
[15:12:05] <robertmaxrees> you're not wront.
[15:12:07] <robertmaxrees> *wrong
[15:50:24] <jose3_> okay
[15:50:32] <jose3_> so when do I know I am ready for a real job
[15:50:41] <robertmaxrees> apply and see if they take you.
[15:50:46] <jose3_> so no then
[15:50:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:50:57] <robertmaxrees> keep applying.
[15:51:00] <robertmaxrees> no reason not to.
[15:51:03] <jose3_> Ive applied for many
[15:51:09] <jose3_> most of the time I just get spam
[15:51:11] <robertmaxrees> and what do they come back with?
[15:51:43] <jose3_> nothing just a bunch of recruiter bs, if I get a real interview I never really hear back from anyone though
[15:51:57] <robertmaxrees> "just a bunch of recruiter bs" like what?
[15:52:19] <jose3_> like a bunch of guys calling me and leaving me messages for senior web development jobs
[15:52:26] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[15:52:30] <robertmaxrees> for other places or...?
[15:52:46] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have to play some of that game.
[15:52:46] <jose3_> just any job positions they have really
[15:53:02] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, keep applying.  do you have any on the job experience?
[15:53:34] <jose3_> yes I have a years working experience
[15:53:41] <jose3_> but its not best practice working experience
[15:53:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:53:56] <jose3_> its more like i get atask and finish it any way possible
[15:54:08] <robertmaxrees> welcome to development.
[15:54:22] <jose3_> and no version control
[15:54:26] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[15:54:26] <jose3_> ...or framework
[15:54:38] <robertmaxrees> so are you still there?  if not, why?
[15:54:53] <jose3_> im at that company right now
[15:55:01] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[15:55:03] <jose3_> im actually at work for another 5 minutes
[15:55:13] <jose3_> Ive stayed here because I have no other experience
[15:55:19] <robertmaxrees> might just be that you need to keep applying and need to keep getting experience.
[15:55:33] <jose3_> yeah I would say so
[15:56:30] <jose3_> *sigh*
[15:56:47] <jose3_> I will be going to 42 usa next month
[15:57:05] <robertmaxrees> the coding camp thing?
[15:57:10] <jose3_> yes sir
[15:57:13] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[15:57:14] <jose3_> in Cali
[15:57:19] <robertmaxrees> that won't help you get a job fwiw.
[15:57:19] <jose3_> yeah im pretty excited
[15:57:26] <robertmaxrees> but getting more experience will always help.
[15:57:38] <jose3_> I think it will if I actually get in
[15:57:45] <jose3_> but not for the month no
[15:58:15] <jonez> it might indirectly help you get a job... shake a lot of hands, meet everyone you can, see what happens
[15:58:18] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:58:22] <robertmaxrees> network, etc.
[15:58:26] <jonez> yup
[15:58:36] <jose3_> i mean the rel program has multiple internships
[15:58:38] <robertmaxrees> (i work with hiring new devs - i know how this works ;) )
[15:58:57] <jose3_> I believe I have a better shot there than traditional networking
[15:59:10] <robertmaxrees> it's still "traditional networking" lol
[16:00:59] <jonez> jose3_, better still.. *define* "traditional networking"
[16:01:15] <jose3_> talking to people, vs actually working
[16:01:33] <jonez> I would argue that networking *is* work
[16:01:44] <jonez> you need to do both
[16:01:50] <jose3_> I believe that working at a company interning is different than talking to people at meetups
[16:02:32] <arc_> if you know somebody you are 1000 times more likely to get a position they have some influence in getting for you
[16:03:01] <jonez> and the more field experience, the better
[16:03:20] <jose3_> words
[16:03:35] <jose3_> gents Im going to go drive through the rush hour traffic
[16:03:40] <jose3_> God Speed
[16:03:44] <AwkwardCough> and if all else fails, bribery works too... unless they have standards in which case run
[16:03:50] <jonez> jej
[16:03:52] <jonez> heh
[16:03:52] <jose3_> hah
[16:05:50] <jonez> you can't get and keep a good job on social contacts alone.. you need to have just enough field experience that you are not a complete newb.
[16:08:16] <robertmaxrees> i with that were true.
[16:08:29] <robertmaxrees> *wish
[17:01:39] <roflmyeggo> is _.max() recommended for getting the max value of a jQuery object array? Such as maximum height
[17:01:52] <roflmyeggo> instead of just iterating through using .each()?
[17:02:32] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use underscore on a jquery object.
[17:04:29] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: thats what i figured, thanks
[17:05:17] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: any particular reason for that recommendation (curious)
[17:05:40] <robertmaxrees> jquery gives you ways to do what you need without it.
[17:05:48] <robertmaxrees> what do you need that element for?
[17:07:31] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: yeah i initially tackled it just by iterating with each() and getting the maximum height by checking against a variable set above
[17:07:53] <roflmyeggo> a colleague suggested i use _.max() instead
[17:08:22] <roflmyeggo> regardless, i have underscore at my disposal on the page anyways
[17:08:44] <roflmyeggo> but i couldnt find any examples using _.max on jquery objects
[17:09:57] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could use it, but jquery objects aren't really arrays.
[17:10:00] <robertmaxrees> they're similarish
[17:11:19] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: yeah it seemed like a bit of a grey area to me
[17:12:23] <roflmyeggo> its kind of odd.. when you pass a jquery object to max, you are required to reselect it in the function body
[17:12:27] <roflmyeggo> for example:
[17:12:58] <roflmyeggo> _.max($obj, function(obj) { return $(obj).height() };);
[17:13:12] <roflmyeggo> even though you are passing in the object, it needs to be reselected again
[17:16:47] <shoky> roflmyeggo: same thing when you iterate a jquery object using  .each() or .map() or whatever
[17:16:59] <roflmyeggo> shoky: yeah thats true i was just thinking that ^_^
[17:17:20] <shoky> that's because the items inside the jquery collection are not themselves jquery objects
[17:17:39] <roflmyeggo> shoky: ohhhhh
[17:18:06] <roflmyeggo> you would think it would save on reselection by keeping them jquery objects?
[17:18:11] <roflmyeggo> so then you wouldnt have to do $(this)?
[17:18:39] <shoky> if you need it as a jquery object you can wrap it,  if you don't then you're good ;p
[17:19:00] <shoky> it's not reselection, anyways
[17:19:09] <shoky> it's just iterating the items in a collection
[17:19:41] <roflmyeggo> shoky: the $(this) isnt selecting it?
[17:20:34] <shoky> oh i thought you meant the .max or .each  is reselecting.  but anyway $(this) is not selecting , it's just wrapping `this` inside a jquery object. it doesn't query the DOM for anything
[17:20:45] <shoky> for selecting, you need a selector :P
[17:20:58] <roflmyeggo> shoky: oh okay
[17:21:00] <shoky> e.g.  '.foo' in $('.foo')
[17:21:02] <roflmyeggo> clearly my jquery is not up to snuff
[17:21:17] <roflmyeggo> shoky: thanks for the explanation :D
[17:21:25] <shoky> shure
[17:41:03] <jak2000> i have 1 click event for 2 classes.... (2 different buttons) how to ask something: if $(this).class='class1' ... ?
[17:41:16] <robertmaxrees> .hasClass('class1')
[17:41:18] <robertmaxrees> or use two listeners.
[17:43:06] <jak2000> understand about 2 listeners.... but.... is same jquery code, only change 1 line
[17:43:24] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just pointing out the other way to do it.,
[17:46:41] <jak2000> robert: http://jsfiddle.net/vHvLh/49/
[17:46:47] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:46:50] <jak2000> how to paint the cell with color White ?
[17:46:56] <jak2000> here i try: http://jsfiddle.net/vHvLh/49/
[17:47:11] <robertmaxrees> youy realize you don't have jquery included, right?
[17:47:21] <jak2000> yes
[17:47:26] <jak2000> j query includded
[17:47:38] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vHvLh/51/
[17:47:40] <robertmaxrees> now it's included.
[17:47:43] <robertmaxrees> so whats the deal?
[17:47:52] <robertmaxrees> you want the cell and not the button?
[17:47:58] <robertmaxrees> then use .closest() to get the cell.
[17:48:36] <jak2000> yes
[17:48:37] <jak2000> cell
[17:48:40] <jak2000> not buton
[17:48:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use .closest() to nab the cell.
[17:49:33] <jak2000> .closest() where in the td? or
[17:49:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:50:15] <robertmaxrees> you want the td and not the button, right?
[17:50:18] <rhizome> $('#button').closest('td')
[17:50:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:50:30] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('td')
[17:50:33] <robertmaxrees> c'mon.
[17:50:34] <rhizome> well yeah
[17:50:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:50:57] <robertmaxrees> trying to get him to think about it.
[17:51:19] <jak2000> $(this).closest('td').css('background-color', '#fff');
[17:51:20] <jak2000> work
[17:51:22] <rhizome> by the same token i was trying to illustrate the base case. ^5
[17:51:45] <jak2000> and how to coloring the background of the next cell(next down
[17:51:59] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to get the current one and use .next9)
[17:52:01] <robertmaxrees> * .next()
[17:52:02] <rhizome> you get three guesses
[17:53:13] <jak2000>  $(this).next('td').css('background-color', '#fff');
[17:53:16] <jak2000> not work :
[17:53:20] <robertmaxrees> read the docs.
[17:53:21] <robertmaxrees> please.
[17:53:22] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/vHvLh/55/
[17:53:35] <jak2000> robertmaxrees wich docs recommend me read please
[17:53:40] <rhizome> you need to get to the td from where you want to operate on the next one
[17:53:43] <robertmaxrees> the docs for .next()
[17:53:48] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the button.
[17:53:52] <robertmaxrees> you need the current TD first.
[17:54:37] <jak2000> $(this).closest('td').next('td').css('background-color', '#fff');
[17:54:46] <robertmaxrees> or just .next()
[17:54:52] <robertmaxrees> like the docs explain
[17:55:05] <jak2000> coloring... the next, but next td to right
[17:55:12] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:55:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:55:17] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[17:55:19] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:55:54] <plamb_> if im using $ajax().done(...) to run some code after someone presses "submit" (say shows a loading spinny)
[17:56:16] <jak2000> i want next td but down
[17:56:18] <jak2000> not right
[17:56:23] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 go to learn.jquery.com
[17:56:29] <robertmaxrees> and learn how to do these things.
[17:56:30] <plamb_> would i bind a focus event to the input associated with the submit within .done()
[17:56:34] <plamb_> or outside of the ajax call
[17:56:39] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ huh?
[17:56:41] <plamb_> say after everything is done
[17:56:41] <plamb_> like
[17:56:51] <plamb_> press submit, spinny shows, everythign works
[17:57:00] <robertmaxrees> then hide the spinner?
[17:57:01] <plamb_> then when someone focuses the input again i wanty the spinny to dissappear
[17:57:07] <plamb_> yeah
[17:57:14] <robertmaxrees> just hide it in the .done()
[17:57:22] <robertmaxrees> or in the focus for the input i guess.
[17:57:25] <plamb_> hmm
[17:57:32] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you'd hide it then.
[17:57:53] <plamb_> im trying this after the spinny timeout
[17:57:55] <plamb_> $('#searchbox').on('focus', function(){console.log("lol!"); $searchSubmit.text("submit");});
[17:58:00] <plamb_> within the .done
[17:58:03] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[17:58:06] <robertmaxrees> oh, sure?
[17:58:19] <plamb_> but the console.log isnt firing on focus
[17:58:32] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle?
[17:59:50] <plamb_> hmmm
[18:00:42] <plamb_> before i do that
[18:00:48] <plamb_> does this actually look like correct code
[18:00:50] <plamb_> http://pastebin.com/1SprSmnp
[18:01:32] <robertmaxrees> don't bind in the done.
[18:01:38] <robertmaxrees> bind outside.
[18:01:43] <plamb_> so just after the ajax code
[18:01:51] <robertmaxrees> or before.
[18:02:47] <plamb_> oh duh
[18:02:57] <plamb_> all of this is within a click event on searchSubmit
[18:03:01] <plamb_> no wonder it isnt working
[18:03:03] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:03:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[18:03:36] <plamb_> it doesnt need to replace that spinny though outside of the click event
[18:03:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:03:54] <plamb_> if i bind it outside of the click event
[18:04:02] <robertmaxrees> not following still.
[18:04:02] <plamb_> anytime someone focuses the input, it will run right
[18:04:10] <robertmaxrees> what will run?
[18:04:13] <plamb_> regardless of whether or not submit has been pressed
[18:04:19] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:04:29] <robertmaxrees> what will actually be in that handler?
[18:04:45] <plamb_> $('#searchbox').on('focus', function(){$searchSubmit.text("submit");});
[18:04:54] <robertmaxrees> you can set a flag using data attributes.
[18:05:11] <plamb_> i see
[18:36:03] <efftter> hey i'm using the javascript var date = new Date(); but how do I update the date model to reflect now
[18:36:14] <robertmaxrees> just get a new one.
[18:36:32] <efftter> i tried to use date.now() but I can't seem to get change
[18:36:44] <robertmaxrees> right, just do datew = new Date(); again.
[18:37:11] <efftter> really, it's not better to recall? ok, if you say so
[18:38:03] <robertmaxrees> you'll effectively have to do the same thing
[18:38:36] <efftter> is there anyway to put new Date(); in a funciton parameter without setting it to a temp variable inbetween?
[18:39:08] <robertmaxrees> theFunctionYouAreCalling(new Date());
[18:39:15] <efftter> oh i didnt know u could do that
[18:39:18] <efftter> thanks robert
[18:39:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:41:38] <efftter> cool, thanks its working
[18:41:58] <tables> how do i write a loop in jquery/
[18:42:01] <tables> ?
[18:42:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:42:11] <robertmaxrees> you mean a for loop?
[18:42:11] <tables> i want to constantly load a page
[18:42:13] <tables> yea
[18:42:18] <tables> how do i constantly load a page?
[18:42:26] <robertmaxrees> "constantly load a page" meaning.....?
[18:42:37] <tables> constantly do load
[18:42:41] <tables> with a loop or something
[18:42:46] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[18:42:56] <tables> i want to load html contents into a div constantly
[18:43:11] <robertmaxrees> you can use a recursive ajax call.
[18:43:17] <robertmaxrees> but that's a really strange thing to want to do.
[18:43:19] <efftter> like timeinterval?
[18:43:30] <robertmaxrees> don't use intervals.
[18:43:45] <robertmaxrees> you can't guarantee the last load completed before firing the next.
[18:43:50] <tables> how do i do recursive ajax call?
[18:44:03] <tables> i don't need the guarantee
[18:44:05] <robertmaxrees> call the function in the .then()
[18:44:09] <robertmaxrees> you do actually.
[18:44:19] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you'll slow the browser to a crawl.
[18:44:26] <tables> oh
[18:44:32] <tables> then nevermind
[18:44:44] <tables> how do i constantly load a page without slowing the browser?
[18:44:45] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get data as soon as its available?
[18:44:51] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[18:44:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:44:58] <robertmaxrees> could you explain a bit more about your use case?
[18:44:59] <tables> yes thats what i'm trying to do
[18:45:08] <tables> i'm trying to make a chat program thats why
[18:45:18] <robertmaxrees> then you want websockets.
[18:45:18] <tables> i just want to constantly append to a div
[18:45:19] <robertmaxrees> not ajax.
[18:45:27] <tables> for starters
[18:45:32] <robertmaxrees> or any other push technology.
[18:45:41] <robertmaxrees> ajax/jquery are not the proper tools for the job.
[18:46:41] <tables> i just want to constantly append to a div
[18:46:47] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:46:49] <robertmaxrees> using websockets.
[18:46:54] <robertmaxrees> ajax is the wrong thing to use here.
[18:47:25] <tables> with a sleep 1
[18:47:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:47:33] <robertmaxrees> okay, fine.
[18:47:33] <tables> can i do it with ajax though?
[18:47:41] <robertmaxrees> the a recursive ajax call with a timout set toi 1 second.
[18:47:50] <robertmaxrees> that's the wrong way to do it, but you refuse to listen sooooo.
[18:48:17] <robertmaxrees> oh cool you're getting help in ##javascript. carry on.
[18:54:26] <tables> how can i append content from a url to a div in jquery?
[18:54:37] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[18:54:40] <robertmaxrees> great resource.
[18:56:08] <robertmaxrees> tables you're never going to get much help if you keep going into multiple channels barking the same thing over and over.
[19:03:45] <jak2000> hi all
[19:04:38] <robertmaxrees> sup
[19:04:46] <jak2000> :)
[19:06:05] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: not show me anything: https://api.jquery.com/next/
[19:06:17] <jak2000> i am ok in the documentation correct?
[19:06:18] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 show us what you tried.
[19:07:43] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/vHvLh/56/
[19:08:04] <robertmaxrees> okay, so what's the cofusion?
[19:08:18] <jak2000> Press the first button, please.. and coloring the next cell (at the right) but i want cooring the next cell (down) understand me?
[19:08:30] <jak2000> pressing button 1,1 coloring the cell 2,1  not 1,2
[19:09:06] <robertmaxrees> for that, you need to get the index of the current td, then go up to the closest tr, get the next tr from that, then find the td in that next tr with the same index.
[19:10:28] <jak2000> ok :)
[19:10:32] <jak2000> reading
[19:12:02] <robertmaxrees> also, no need for .next('td') in there.
[19:15:03] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: $(this).closest('td').rowIndex   ?
[19:15:09] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:15:50] <robertmaxrees> .index()
[19:15:54] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:16:30] <jak2000> ok $(this).closest('td').index();
[19:16:32] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vHvLh/59/
[19:16:39] <robertmaxrees> this is much cleaner so car.
[19:16:41] <robertmaxrees> yes
[19:17:03] <jak2000> yes
[19:17:04] <jak2000> working
[19:18:06] <jak2000> get index: http://jsfiddle.net/vHvLh/61/
[19:18:18] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:18:21] <robertmaxrees> $currentCell.index()
[19:18:25] <robertmaxrees> also use console.log()
[19:18:28] <robertmaxrees> alerts() are annoying.
[19:19:15] <jak2000> <robertmaxrees> for that, you need to get the index of the current td,  DONE
[19:19:27] <jak2000> <robertmaxrees> then go up to the closest tr,  WORKING
[19:20:18] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[19:20:49] <jak2000> <robertmaxrees> then go up to the closest tr,  DONE: $currentRow.closest("tr").index()    http://jsfiddle.net/vHvLh/63/
[19:21:02] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:21:03] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:21:10] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you keep giving me status updates lol.
[19:21:18] <jak2000> and: get the next tr from that, then find the td in that next tr with the same index.  <-- how to :(
[19:21:41] <rhizome> do you remember how you got the next td when that was your question?
[19:21:46] <robertmaxrees> ^ ;)
[19:21:51] <robertmaxrees> building on knowledge you alreayd have.
[19:23:01] <jak2000> yes
[19:23:35] <jak2000> something like that: $(this).closest('td').next('td').css('background-color', '#fff');
[19:23:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:23:51] <robertmaxrees> stop with .next('td')
[19:23:56] <robertmaxrees> you need the next tr
[19:24:20] <robertmaxrees> get the current tr then get the next one.
[19:25:54] <jak2000> $(this).closest('tr').next('tr').css('background-color', '#fff');   <-- if click on button 1,1 paint entire row 2,1 nad 2,2 cells
[19:26:10] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:26:10] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:26:23] <robertmaxrees> you want the child td of that tr whose index matched the current one.
[19:30:20] <jak2000> $(this).closest('tr').children('td').eq($currentRow.closest("tr").index());   :(
[19:30:49] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:30:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:30:58] <robertmaxrees> read that that says.
[19:31:01] <jak2000> yes
[19:31:26] <robertmaxrees> ....
[19:31:32] <robertmaxrees> step through it
[19:31:51] <robertmaxrees> where's the part where you get the next tr?
[19:32:18] <jak2000> $(this).closest('tr').next();
[19:32:51] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:32:55] <robertmaxrees> so what do you do with that?
[19:33:44] <jak2000> get the child
[19:33:47] <jak2000> $(this).closest('tr').next().children('td').eq($currentRow.closest("tr").index());
[19:33:54] <jak2000> not work too
[19:34:07] <robertmaxrees> why do you think that is?
[19:34:19] <jak2000> i get the next tr: $(this).closest('tr').next()
[19:34:22] <robertmaxrees> why do you care about the index of the parent tr.
[19:34:53] <jak2000> from here i get the td with same index
[19:34:57] <jak2000> of previous cell
[19:34:58] <jak2000> not?
[19:35:30] <jak2000> done:   $(this).closest('tr').next().children('td').eq($currentRow.closest("tr").index()).css('background-color', '#fff');
[19:35:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.  no need for the 'td' in children btw.
[19:35:42] <jak2000> i am a Genious right?
[19:35:44] <robertmaxrees> and use classes.
[19:35:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vHvLh/73/
[19:35:54] <jak2000> how to? tech me please
[19:36:00] <robertmaxrees> ^ ;)
[19:36:50] <jak2000> beautiful
[19:41:20] <jak2000> its ok:     $(document).on("click", ".btnCopiaAbajo, .btnCopiaDerecha", function () {     separated by commas?
[19:41:38] <robertmaxrees> are you asking for permission?
[19:42:19] <jak2000> the 2 classes
[19:42:26] <robertmaxrees> did you try?
[19:42:27] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:43:34] <jak2000> if ($(this)..hasClass('btnCopiaAbajo')) { not work
[19:43:38] <jak2000> what i am wrong?
[19:43:41] <jak2000> ooo
[19:43:50] <jak2000> ..
[19:44:14] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:45:56] <jak2000> done....
[19:46:19] <jak2000> robert. a cell can be draged to other cell? if yes how to?
[19:46:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:46:59] <jak2000> DRAG FROM POS 1,1 TO 1,2
[19:47:03] <jak2000> sorry for caps
[19:47:09] <robertmaxrees> define "drag"
[19:47:19] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to be able to drag and drop them to different places?
[19:47:38] <jak2000> yes
[19:47:44] <jak2000> 1 cell (all content)..
[19:48:13] <robertmaxrees> possible, though I woudln't use a table for that.
[19:48:20] <robertmaxrees> check out the drag and drop stuff.
[23:08:23] <momomo> Is there an event one can listen to when a css file has done parsing? or for instance when html inserted into an element has actually done rendering ?
[23:36:45] <nivyaj> Hey there
