[06:51:43] <stitched_unicorn> hi - got a question, anyone around?
[07:07:36] <devi8> ask away
[07:11:22] <bunny3> is the argument to $("") regexp?
[07:11:54] <devi8> huh?
[07:12:05] <bunny3> is the argument to $( arg ) regexp?
[07:12:39] <devi8> no
[07:13:47] <devi8> it's a sizzle selector (I think) or a css selector $("#item") selects the element with id='item'
[07:20:11] <Cork> bunny3: it is regex too, for the jqeury extensions
[07:20:32] <Cork> when that filter is done it is fead to document.querySelectorAll()
[07:20:51] <Cork> (extensions are things like :eq, :first, :last, :last-child and so on)
[07:22:29] <bunny3> can you select all #a.* IDs for example?
[07:25:04] <Cork> bunny3: not with that syntax, and you should not do that
[07:25:14] <devi8> do you mean all elements whose id attribute starts with a
[07:25:16] <Cork> id and classes has hash tables in the browser
[07:25:28] <Cork> so if you want to select a group of elements, use a class
[07:26:24] <Cork> if you want to select elements based on a patial id value you would have to fall back to attibute selectors
[07:26:32] <Cork> and those has no lookup table at all
[07:26:45] <Cork> (so you effectively work around the browsers optimizations)
[07:28:25] <bunny3> devi8: yes
[07:36:03] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/CuirPork/adhpo7un/3/
[07:36:59] <devi8> $("*[id^='a']")   says select all elements with an id attribute that starts with "a"
[07:37:44] <Woet> don't do that though
[07:37:48] <Woet> for the reasons Cork mentioned
[07:37:51] <devi8> agreed
[07:45:24] <bunny3> iirc, you want to use jquery to store variables in dom-objects?  rather than myElement.variable = 123; there's a jQuery thing for that?
[07:47:15] <Cork> bunny3: .data()
[08:26:22] <bunny3> is it bad to appendChild(myVar) and removeChild(myVar) back and forth and keep myVar around?
[08:26:52] <bunny3> iirc, jQuery had a thing for that too and recommended you to not do the above?
[08:30:24] <Cork> bunny3: append and detach an element isn't costing much no
[08:30:41] <Cork> jquery has .append() and .detach() for the same purpus
[08:31:24] <bunny3> shouldn't matter whether I use .detatch() or removeChild?
[08:31:50] <Cork> they do the same thing
[08:31:51] <bunny3> I mean with regards to whether it's safe and sane to keep myVar around
[08:31:59] <bunny3> ok :)
[08:32:08] <Cork> they remove the parent link from the element
[08:32:19] <Cork> jquery remove() is not the same as dom removeChild though
[09:57:00] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:58:29] <jomofcw> Before submiting a form using jQuery (trigger submit) I preprend to it a hidden input... but the data of this input seems to not be submited :/... is it normal, please ?
[09:59:03] <Cork> jomofcw: from where are you modifying the form?
[09:59:51] <jomofcw> Hello Cork ^^.
[10:01:24] <jomofcw> Cork, in a select change event. I get the closest form to that select and trigger it. Code there : https://gist.github.com/jomofcw/d370a1fc73f6c035f7a0d4d1d6b91d20
[10:02:32] <Cork> would prob use $(this.form) instead, but ya, that should work fine
[10:02:43] <Cork> note though if you ever fire that twice the old value will win
[10:02:57] <Cork> i would prob just have a static hidden input and modify it instead
[10:03:21] <Cork> other then that it should work fine
[10:03:49] <jomofcw> Hm you're right, I'll modify an existing hidden input. I try this, thanks ^^.
[10:03:54] <Cork> (also i would prob delegate the event to the form instead of binding it on the totaux_pays field)
[10:04:20] <Cork> oh, btw the if case isn't needed either way
[10:04:27] <Cork> jquery handles it internally
[10:04:56] * Cork afk
[10:06:24] <jomofcw> Works ! TY Cork :).
[10:54:56] <juslintek> Hi is animate no longer working or what? https://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/z2ojan3x/1/
[10:55:05] <juslintek> why its not changing backgroundColor?
[10:58:21] <shoky> juslintek: animate only works on numeric properties.  there's some plugin for adding support for background animation.  or best to just use css transitions: https://jsfiddle.net/6qx8v9kp/
[11:24:03] <juslintek> shoky, yeah I was for some unknown reason very sure, that animation could animate colors, then I've read more and I saw that it can't jquery-ui adds that kind of functionality and some other plugins.
[12:31:28] <bunny3> can you store functions with dom elements?
[12:36:42] <pavonia> You could store them as strings and eval() afterwards, but do you really want that?
[13:09:58] <djbozzz> Hey all -- for JS dev w/ jQuery, how do you organize events? Do you encapsulate all events on DOM elements in a single class/object & then pass in dependencies to be called accordingly?
[13:10:26] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what you mean?
[13:14:20] <djbozzz> I just have a ton of events on different DOM elements -- was wondering if I should encapsulate them in a single class -- or if thats an anti-pattern
[13:14:52] <robertmaxrees> the reason i'm asking for an example is because you don't "have a ton of events" - you're binding event listeners.
[13:15:22] <djbozzz> Sorry, yes. Poor word choice.
[13:15:22] <robertmaxrees> and it all depends.  depending on what your code is doing, you'll want to organize your logic in particular ways.
[13:15:59] <robertmaxrees> if your logic is all interrelated, i'd question why you're bidning so many listeners.  maybe delegation is a better idea.  maybe it's not.
[13:17:40] <djbozzz> I'm creating a dynamic editor(like wordpress's template editor) so binding events from editor changes to update an HTML doc
[13:18:35] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to approach something like that.
[13:19:09] <robertmaxrees> though i might argue that jquery is the wrong tool for a job like that, you're probably best off binding delegated listeners to the editor component.
[13:19:27] <robertmaxrees> and then use classnames to map actions to methods.  or something along those lines.
[13:20:29] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: Yeah thats what I'm doing -- but I have 10-20 events (button clicks etc...) that are hard-coded and the rest are dynamically generated based on input type & className
[13:20:51] <robertmaxrees> "the rest are dynaimically generated" - what do you mean?
[13:21:02] <djbozzz> I dynamically generate a event listener per class-name to update some targeted class in the HTML template
[13:21:10] <robertmaxrees> can you show me how you're doing that?
[13:21:14] <robertmaxrees> becuase, generally, that's a bad idea.
[13:22:52] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/v17ghnxr/
[13:23:19] <robertmaxrees> so why do you think you need to dynamically generate listeners?
[13:23:38] <robertmaxrees> instead of just using delegated listeners?
[13:23:40] <djbozzz> The tool is an email newsletter generator
[13:23:55] <robertmaxrees> okay?  what does that have to do with my question? :)
[13:23:57] <djbozzz> And we have multiple templates with different fields
[13:24:09] <djbozzz> ha trying to give generic background on thought process
[13:24:18] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with delegated handlers?
[13:24:24] <djbozzz> No JS knowledge is subpar
[13:24:51] <robertmaxrees> okay - if you see me using terminology you aren't familiar with, you'll want to call that out.
[13:24:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:25:01] <robertmaxrees> so i'm guessing you went with these dynamic handlers because you'
[13:25:08] <robertmaxrees> *you're dynamically generating content, right?
[13:25:15] <robertmaxrees> and you needed a way to bind to newly created elements.
[13:25:17] <djbozzz> Yeah, exactly
[13:25:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:25:24] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to do that.
[13:25:56] <robertmaxrees> there's a built-in way to handle that.
[13:25:57] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:26:10] <robertmaxrees> and also: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[13:26:45] <djbozzz> Okay, awesome! Would jQuery be the right tool for the job
[13:27:21] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i'd question why you're budiling our your own WYSIWYG when there are tons out there already,
[13:29:50] <djbozzz> The WYSIWYG is dynamically generated and not necessarily a WYSIWYG because it just edits direct text
[13:30:32] <robertmaxrees> ah.  your references to there being "10-20" handlers made it seem like it was more fully featured than a text editor.
[13:31:45] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, without seeing more details it's hard to suggest anything heh.
[13:31:55] <djbozzz> nah just generic text editor -- but we have a "save" button to save fields of a template into a DB, "retrieve" to fetch a newsletter -- basically a CRUD app --
[13:32:24] <djbozzz> hahah yeah was trying to give generic background
[13:32:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah the issue is "generic background" isn't really helpful
[13:32:36] <djbozzz> Most of the 10-20 events are things that are similar across multiple templates
[13:32:48] <djbozzz> Valid
[13:32:56] <djbozzz> Any other suggestions besides delegated-events?
[13:33:02] <djbozzz> Or... is jQuery even the right tool for this?
[13:33:06] <robertmaxrees> *delegated handlers
[13:33:11] <robertmaxrees> and again, no clue
[13:33:30] <robertmaxrees> without seeing more and understanding your app, i can't really give advice.
[13:33:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd tentatively suggest something like react or vue, but they may be entirely inappropriate.
[13:35:36] <djbozzz> I think React isn't possible because of the editor itself is created off the cuff based on the template that is chosen and doesn't have many consistencies across the board
[13:35:53] <robertmaxrees> react would be fine for something like that.
[13:36:17] <robertmaxrees> just need to change your mental model about how it works heh
[13:36:41] <djbozzz> Isn't that an anti-pattern lol
[13:36:52] <robertmaxrees> isn't what an anti-pattern?
[13:38:03] <robertmaxrees> ah nevermind, you're getting help in ##javascript :) good luck!
[13:38:53] <djbozzz> Using react to generate dynamic content and updating non-existent dom elements -- I could probably do it with refs but they are just a way ref dom nodes/components in Reacts render tree -- where the HTML document/template Im loading to edit would not be in Reacts render tree -- since its not "safe" javascript
[13:40:08] <djbozzz> Which is why I moved away from React -- though don't know much about Vue
[13:40:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:41:08] <djbozzz> Background: Loadiing a HTML template with blank tables from s3 -- then HTML components that are in db are loaded into the template based on subTypes that are turned on or off and you can then edit those components based on subType fields
[13:41:19] <robertmaxrees> okie.
[13:41:23] <robertmaxrees> good luck!
[13:41:42] <djbozzz> Ha thanks! Any other suggestions would be awesome :D
[13:42:02] <robertmaxrees> fwiw it's frowned upon to ask the same question in multiplt channels at the same time.
[13:42:59] <djbozzz> Ah.... my bad had no idea!
[13:43:22] <djbozzz> Originally asked q in ##javascript was told to ask here but followed the convo there!
[13:43:46] <djbozzz> appreciate the help & advice though, thank you!
[14:12:27] <bunny3> is it bad to store jquery objects in an array for later use?
[14:31:44] <bestdesign> hello
[14:31:50] <bestdesign> whats up?
[14:31:53] <bestdesign> hi :D
[14:32:06] <bestdesign> i have a jsfiddle
[14:32:15] <bestdesign> about js how i can make less line?
[14:32:18] <bestdesign> is about scroll
[14:32:19] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/Lc6n0jez/
[14:32:55] <bestdesign> i mean to not repeat .animate 4 times
[14:37:56] <shoky> bestdesign: here's one way  https://jsfiddle.net/38tjkuv2/
[14:38:50] <bestdesign> shoky thanks!
[14:39:28] <shoky> bestdesign: https://jsfiddle.net/38tjkuv2/1/  also does 4 -> 1  now
[14:40:22] <bestdesign> ty!
[14:56:08] <AndresInSpace> how would I compare a non-jquery elm to a jquery object (array of elms)
[14:56:15] <AndresInSpace> if my node is in that object
[14:56:39] <AndresInSpace> aka e.target.parentNode is in object-array
[14:58:28] <bunny3> how do you reference to other jquery objects?
[15:05:03] <shoky> AndresInSpace: $jqObj.is( element )
[15:21:51] <pavonia> bunny3: Why would you have several jQuery objects loaded at once?
[15:23:58] <bunny3> as references
[15:24:14] <robertmaxrees> why in an array?
[15:24:35] <robertmaxrees> like, it's not bad to select once and then reuse, but putting them in an array is... an interesting choice.,
[15:24:46] <bunny3> array indexes as coordinates in a 2D-grid that references to their dom cells
[15:25:11] <bunny3> ill just reference to the dom elements, not jquery objects wrapping the elements
[15:31:24] <AndresInSpace> ok so is this code alright ? anyone see issues with it? https://jsfiddle.net/m6fswLpt/
[15:31:54] <robertmaxrees> couple things
[15:32:07] <robertmaxrees> 1: though you CAN do a length check, it's not really needed.
[15:32:34] <robertmaxrees> 2: don't declare functions inside of if statements.
[15:33:26] <AndresInSpace> the functions get hoisted dont they
[15:33:48] <robertmaxrees> it's all about readability imo.
[15:33:50] <AndresInSpace> yeah true
[15:34:04] <MassDebates> Good thing you checked in with ol'e robertmaxrees
[15:34:06] <AndresInSpace> well i placed them inside cause they should never be accessible from outside
[15:34:12] <MassDebates> That dusty old bastard can spot anything
[15:34:35] <robertmaxrees> AndresInSpace are you reusing "onAccordions" anywhere?
[15:34:43] <robertmaxrees> or are you declaring that just so you have that scope?
[15:35:06] <MassDebates> I figured it was just necessary for the fiddle.
[15:35:08] <AndresInSpace> i was planning on this being just globally run on  a page, so whatever accordino groups are there all get picked up
[15:35:36] <robertmaxrees> AndresInSpace so you need onAccordions but don't want any of the other functions accessible?
[15:35:40] <AndresInSpace> yeah
[15:35:45] <AndresInSpace> I could make this OOP
[15:35:48] <AndresInSpace> prob better
[15:35:59] <robertmaxrees> sec
[15:36:12] <AndresInSpace> but i digress, not that important to have this 100% max efficient , i got other stuff on my plate.. long as it is good and bug free
[15:36:43] <AndresInSpace> I'm still considering innput hacks MassDebates
[15:36:44] <AndresInSpace> ;)
[15:37:04] <MassDebates> Oh no way man
[15:37:07] <MassDebates> Stick with this
[15:37:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fm9owqeb/2/
[15:37:09] <AndresInSpace> ahahahaha
[15:37:17] <robertmaxrees> then just do something like this ^
[15:37:29] <MassDebates> I always hate things like line 27
[15:37:30] <robertmaxrees> relying on hoisting is gross imo
[15:37:33] <MassDebates> I like breaking those out on multiple lines
[15:37:47] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates for iifes?
[15:37:49] <AndresInSpace> interesting
[15:38:21] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees, yeah. It makes me see htings more easily
[15:38:21] <AndresInSpace> you just made it a scoped function tot he variable , to define the 'private' methods and return function for logic
[15:38:36] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates most people prefer the version i used.
[15:38:43] <robertmaxrees> rarely see that broken out otherwise.
[15:38:46] <MassDebates> I know.
[15:38:46] <MassDebates> I hate it
[15:38:48] <MassDebates> lol
[15:38:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:38:55] <MassDebates> I have a hard enough time with this shit
[15:39:19] <MassDebates> and people gotta lump a bunch of brackets and parenthesis to close shit off at the end, okay, I get that, but there's little benefit to smushing that shit together
[15:39:24] <AndresInSpace> robertmaxrees: why the wrapping () on the onAccordion function
[15:39:33] <robertmaxrees> AndresInSpace that's an IIFE.
[15:39:52] <AndresInSpace> ah
[15:40:01] <robertmaxrees> basically a way to run a function without needed to declare it and then call it separately.
[15:40:03] <MassDebates> immediately invoked thingy thing
[15:40:13] <robertmaxrees> immediately invoked function expression
[15:40:19] <AndresInSpace> so does that run it and then retain reference?
[15:40:21] <MassDebates> yeah that
[15:40:51] <robertmaxrees> AndresInSpace yep!  it's similar to declaring a function and then running it, but skips the part where you store the function itself in a var.
[15:40:51] <AndresInSpace> cool beans
[15:40:56] <AndresInSpace> gotcha
[15:41:04] <AndresInSpace> thanks robertmaxrees you've been very helpful
[15:41:20] <robertmaxrees> my pleasure :)
[15:42:16] <AndresInSpace> I just made this cause I didnt like all the ones that use jquery 'slideUp' and 'slideToggle' etc
[15:42:28] <robertmaxrees> for accordions you mean?
[15:42:31] <AndresInSpace> ye
[15:43:15] <AndresInSpace> seems like alot of unnecessary js when css can handle almost all of it
[15:43:38] <MassDebates> I am a fan of class swaps too
[15:43:38] <robertmaxrees> all about the right tool for the job, but yeah.
[15:43:55] <MassDebates> what is a good use for slide up/toggle etc robertmaxrees ?
[15:44:03] <MassDebates> Like, something that can't be done otherwise in a relatively easy manner?
[15:44:27] <robertmaxrees> as a rule, i never use toggles.
[15:44:34] <MassDebates> http://api.jquery.com/slidetoggle/ doesn't make me feel good
[15:44:37] <MassDebates> Ah
[15:44:38] <robertmaxrees> i require that people pass in booleans.
[15:44:41] <MassDebates> so i wasn't crazy
[15:45:09] <robertmaxrees> slideup and slidedown effects, eh.  i prefer to avoid them, but i also don't stress a ton for smaller projects.
[15:45:16] <AndresInSpace> ^
[15:45:24] <robertmaxrees> i just avoid overengineering things in practice./
[15:45:32] <AndresInSpace> css for everything  you can manage
[15:45:37] <MassDebates> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[15:45:38] <AndresInSpace> my philospophy
[15:45:52] <MassDebates> Yeah, I think a lot of things are inherently overengineering if you can use css instead without detriment
[15:45:54] <robertmaxrees> yar.
[15:46:04] <MassDebates> css input hack for example, is somethign that has some detriment because of support and accessibility
[15:46:21] <MassDebates> I miss taplar
[15:46:22] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates that's not necessarily always accurate though.
[15:46:26] <AndresInSpace> oh i had that if(group.length) cause i wanted to add another event listener
[15:46:27] <robertmaxrees> not really a straightforward comparison.
[15:46:35] <AndresInSpace> cause i need to kill this/unset it if it's dekstop
[15:46:36] <robertmaxrees> AndresInSpace huh?
[15:46:52] <robertmaxrees> 'kay./
[15:46:59] <AndresInSpace> if(group.length){ eventForResize; group.on(../) }
[15:47:19] <robertmaxrees>  eventForResize
[15:47:20] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:47:30] <AndresInSpace> placeholder
[15:47:31] <AndresInSpace> lol
[15:47:40] <robertmaxrees> you're not using .trigger(), right?
[15:47:42] <AndresInSpace> no
[15:47:47] <robertmaxrees> okay cool
[15:47:54] <MassDebates> or else he'd be triggered
[15:47:59] * MassDebates couldn't resist
[15:48:25] <AndresInSpace> I lied
[15:48:34] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:48:44] <AndresInSpace> it's using $j(window).trigger('delayed-resize',e);
[15:48:48] <robertmaxrees> nonononono
[15:48:50] <AndresInSpace> to trigger that event
[15:48:50] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[15:48:59] <AndresInSpace> yeah this is native code from app, i can change tho
[15:49:05] <AndresInSpace> (magento 1,x)
[15:49:19] <AndresInSpace> robertmaxrees: what do you recommend to trigger events?
[15:49:20] <robertmaxrees> :/
[15:49:28] <robertmaxrees> you don't trigger them at all.
[15:49:29] <MassDebates> Don't change it.
[15:49:31] <robertmaxrees> you want to call a function.
[15:49:40] <MassDebates> Err, I wouldn't change the mage
[15:49:50] <robertmaxrees> neither would i
[15:49:50] <AndresInSpace> MassDebates: this is theme js
[15:49:55] <MassDebates> Oh
[15:49:55] <AndresInSpace> not core js
[15:49:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:49:58] <MassDebates> Oh sorry
[15:50:02] <AndresInSpace> i am not that special
[15:50:02] <MassDebates> okay, I'll just be quiet now.
[15:50:06] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, call a function instead.
[15:50:07] * MassDebates goes back to his hole
[15:50:27] <AndresInSpace> robertmaxrees: whys it so bad?
[15:51:02] <jjrabbit> hello
[15:51:12] <robertmaxrees> AndresInSpace you're adding an extra layer to calling a functions
[15:51:17] <robertmaxrees> don't proxy that through the DOM :)
[15:51:39] <jjrabbit> anyone know where i would place this bit of js code?
[15:51:44] <jjrabbit> https://jsfiddle.net/gdeh3qrk/
[15:51:51] <AndresInSpace> well i will come back to it with your remarks in mind
[15:52:08] <robertmaxrees> jjrabbit uhh, in a js file?
[15:52:17] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're asking.
[15:52:29] <jjrabbit> where in my js would it go though
[15:52:45] <robertmaxrees> anywhere?
[15:52:53] <robertmaxrees> i feel like we're missing an important detail.,
[15:53:10] <jjrabbit> so i know the $(window).on..... can go anywhere
[15:53:17] <jjrabbit> but there is also var resizeTimer;
[15:53:32] <jjrabbit> if i just place it anywhere isn't var resizeTimer going to be a global variable?
[15:53:46] <robertmaxrees> you can wrap that in an iife.

[15:54:12] <robertmaxrees> now resizeTimer isn't global
[15:54:22] <jjrabbit> robertmaxrees: awesome
[15:54:26] <jjrabbit> i didn't know about iife's
[15:54:37] <jjrabbit> doing it this way is preferrable right?
[15:54:38] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/ for more reading
[15:54:49] <robertmaxrees> preferable to what?  have global vars?
[15:54:52] <robertmaxrees> *having
[15:55:02] <jjrabbit> yea, preferrable to my original snippet i mean
[15:55:06] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:55:11] <robertmaxrees> you want to avoid global vars when possible.
[15:55:20] <jjrabbit> so a common way is to wrap in iife?
[15:55:44] <robertmaxrees> depending on what you're trying to do.
[15:55:46] <robertmaxrees> but yeah
[15:56:10] <jjrabbit> yea for something like this where it gets randomly called
[15:56:16] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:56:34] <jjrabbit> normally i would wrap all that in a function
[15:56:42] <jjrabbit> well like a function with a name and stuff
[15:56:48] <jjrabbit> declared function i guess
[15:56:59] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:57:24] <jjrabbit> learn something new everyday
[15:57:27] <jjrabbit> thanks robert!
[15:57:42] <robertmaxrees> my pleasure :)
[18:54:41] <bunny3> is jquery less powerful compared to JS since JS got forEach and query selector and such?
[18:55:02] <bunny3> excellent grammar
[18:56:27] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:56:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript
[18:56:54] <robertmaxrees> and many jquery features inspired javascript features (like queryselectorall)
[18:57:33] <bunny3> has the convenience gap between jquery and the latest JS versions become so narrow now that jquery isn't as alluring anymore?
[18:57:41] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[18:58:08] <robertmaxrees> jquery has a rich plugin ecosystem, and there are still some libraries and frameworks that rely on it.
[18:58:23] <bunny3> I can buy that
[18:58:34] <robertmaxrees> also: cross-browser support without webpack and/or babel can be nice.
[18:58:38] <robertmaxrees> all about the right tool for the job.
[18:59:01] <bunny3> I'm new to jquery and I feel that I just lost its golden age
[18:59:16] <bunny3> lost/missed
[18:59:59] <robertmaxrees> ish?
[19:01:19] <HewloThere> hey! i'm having an issue using ternary operator in jquery.append() function, i'm getting "unexpected token ) on line 36" (21 in this case), but if line 21 is commented it works
[19:01:39] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us?
[19:01:43] <HewloThere> err sorry
[19:01:44] <HewloThere> http://paste.hewlothere.me/ocexizoyop.xml
[19:01:49] <HewloThere> i meant http://paste.hewlothere.me/ocexizoyop.js
[19:03:07] <HewloThere> (the value from soc[0]["announced"] is either 0 or 1, but i did try both == 1 and === 1 and === true and == true
[19:03:16] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a closing square.
[19:03:19] <robertmaxrees> or have an extra square
[19:03:29] <robertmaxrees> ([soc[0]["announced"] ? "Yes" : "No")
[19:03:47] <robertmaxrees> the [ just in front of soc is never closed.
[19:04:25] <HewloThere> smh, not sure how i didn't notice that! didn't even need the [ in front of soc. smh. thanks guys!!!!
[19:12:11] <djbozzz> :robertmaxrees: Just wanted to say thanks for the event delegation suggestion earlier -- really cleaned up my code significantly -- no more recursive functions to create event listeners!
[19:16:23] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:16:26] <robertmaxrees> keep it easy.
[19:18:01] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: HA would love too much I had no idea event delegation was a thing! Yah learn something new every day
[19:22:21] <robertmaxrees> djbozzz i might give http://learn.jquery.com/ a runthrough :)
[19:22:41] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: Will do!
