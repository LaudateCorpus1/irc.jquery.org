[00:01:14] <ParadoxQuine> i did google it, yes, and im not using other libs
[00:01:24] <ParadoxQuine> it seems to occur on a replaceWith call
[00:01:38] <ParadoxQuine> but...$(this) is a valid node
[00:01:48] <ParadoxQuine> and it actually does replace it correctly
[00:02:25] <ParadoxQuine> that same node has another problem though: using .parents() and such to look up the dom heirarchy shows nothing...but if i look at the source in the page it's in there and has a parent div
[00:03:07] <Trudko> Hi guys I wanted to implement Observer pattern. I have object which have method and everytime it is used every listener should be notified and do whatever they want to do I tried this http://jsfiddle.net/sWj2Y/
[00:03:36] <Trudko> and I hoped that because i did obj.test() alert("Moja funkcia") should be triggered
[00:04:06] <Trudko> if I try $(document).trigger("MyObject.test") then only  alert("Moja funkcia"); is shown but no alert("test") I  hope its clear.
[00:05:03] <ramkam001> ParadoxQuine: try putting a sample in http://jsfiddle.net
[00:06:15] <ParadoxQuine> i would but i'd have to put like 3 diff full js files in to make it happen - i have a dozen other replaceWith calls in simpler scenarios and they all work
[00:08:27] <ParadoxQuine> are there some circumstances under which jquery will lose track of something within the dom?
[00:08:42] <ParadoxQuine> i have a hierarchical list and i'm doing a lot of replaceWith calls to replace chunks of it
[00:12:01] <ParadoxQuine> i set a breakpoint at the line and printed out $(this) and it's totally fine, as is the code i'm trying to replace it with
[00:17:11] <ParadoxQuine> it...suddenly stopped erroring
[00:18:46] <ParadoxQuine> i guess "disable cache" in the dev channel wasn't working properly today
[00:19:25] <Trudko> Hi guys I wanted to implement Observer pattern. I have object which have method and everytime it is used every listener should be notified and do whatever they want to do I tried this http://jsfiddle.net/sWj2Y/

[00:19:29] <Trudko> and I hoped that because i did obj.test() alert("Moja funkcia") should be triggered
[00:21:22] <ParadoxQuine> i don't have an answer for you or else id try to help trudko, sorry
[00:21:31] <ParadoxQuine> but i did think about it!
[00:21:55] <ParadoxQuine> oh uh
[00:21:58] <ParadoxQuine> actually let me take a look
[00:22:01] <Trudko> ParadoxQuine: heh don't worries! But thanks :)
[00:22:45] <camo2> hey, can someone help me? im at the final stages of finishing this site but i think im have a jquery conflict problem
[00:22:54] <camo2> the url is http://247sec.com/
[00:23:10] <camo2> when you click on SEC VIDEO and then back to SEC NEWS the slider jquery stops working
[00:24:24] <ParadoxQuine> Trudko: are you sure you can use Trigger that way?
[00:24:42] <Trudko> I can :D it just don't do what I expect it do to
[00:24:51] <ParadoxQuine> haha
[00:24:54] <Trudko> maybe I am doing it wrong completely
[00:25:06] <ParadoxQuine> unless im missing something, it's just sending a custom event string to the doc
[00:25:07] <Trudko> Do you get what I am trying to do in first place?
[00:25:26] <ParadoxQuine> it looks to me like you're trying to trigger a custom event AND call a method on your object
[00:25:49] <Trudko> I have object which have function test and I want to allow client to write whatever code which will be triggered after my function Test will be called everytime. I am trying to do observer pattern
[00:26:10] <Trudko> I did using pure javascript , but heard that jquery could make it easier for me
[00:26:27] <ParadoxQuine> why not have, inside MyObject.test, a call to document.trigger?
[00:27:33] <ParadoxQuine> then anything they do that calls MyObject.test will trigger the event
[00:27:52] <ParadoxQuine> without them having to be exposed to any of the innerworkings of test and your event system
[00:29:02] <Trudko> ParadoxQuine: not sure what do you mean? Are u saying I should $(document).trigger("MyObject.test"); inside of MyObject.test ?
[00:29:15] <ParadoxQuine> well, would that solve your problem?
[00:30:18] <ParadoxQuine> ack, gotta go to bed, meeting in the morning, good luck trudko
[00:41:28] <camo2> i figured it out
[00:42:02] <prabesh> hello
[00:42:46] <prabesh> $('a.remove_button').click ->
[00:42:47] <prabesh>     answer = confirm "Are you Sure?"
[00:42:51] <prabesh> I have 9 elements that match
[00:43:17] <prabesh> I thought everytime I click on element with the match it will call the event once
[00:43:28] <prabesh> but each time it is calling 10 times instead of once
[00:43:41] <prabesh> any suggestions ?
[00:44:25] <prabesh> do I need to stop the event to prevent it from being called multiple times ?
[00:44:42] <dr0id> prove or it didn't happen
[00:46:24] <prabesh> hmm..
[00:46:29] <prabesh> ok I will send you the link
[00:48:53] <prabesh> http://4hnj.localtunnel.com
[00:49:00] <prabesh> can you see the remove link there
[00:49:02] <prabesh> ?
[00:49:55] <prabesh> ($ document).ready ->
[00:49:56] <prabesh>   $('a.remove_button').click ->
[00:49:56] <prabesh>     answer = confirm "Are you Sure?"
[00:49:59] <prabesh> that is being called with
[00:50:02] <prabesh> the above jquery
[00:50:28] <prabesh> :dr0id are you there ?
[00:52:32] <dr0id> I can see the remove link
[00:53:20] <prabesh> ok , when you click on that one, it is being called 9 times instead of just once
[00:53:46] <dr0id> ok
[00:54:21] <prabesh> can you suggest why ?
[00:54:38] <dr0id> because you are doing it so
[00:55:55] <prabesh> dr0id: how do I add event to all link with remove_button class but run the confirm only for the link I click
[00:55:56] <prabesh> ?
[00:56:11] <Peeter> Does anyone have any info on how exactly .html handles adding a string to the dom (string is html with a script tag)
[00:56:33] <dr0id> bind a click event and confirm() or some custom modal
[00:56:37] <dr0id> ?click
[00:56:38] <bot-t> .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[00:57:24] <prabesh> dr0id: ok I will try with bind
[00:58:07] <prabesh> $("p").click(function () {
[00:58:07] <prabesh>       $(this).slideUp();
[00:58:07] <prabesh>     });
[00:58:21] <prabesh> dr0id: but in the example in the page you just sent they have above one working fine which doesn't use bind
[00:58:37] <prabesh> dr0id: why is it different with my case ?
[00:58:47] <dr0id> because you are doing something different
[00:59:18] <prabesh> This method is a shortcut for .bind('click', handler) in the first two variations, and .trigger('click') in the third.
[00:59:28] <prabesh> all should have been same
[01:00:07] <prabesh> ($(document)).ready(function() {
[01:00:08] <prabesh>   return $('a.remove_button').click(function() {
[01:00:08] <prabesh>     var answer;
[01:00:09] <prabesh>     return answer = confirm("Are you Sure?");
[01:00:11] <prabesh>   });
[01:00:13] <prabesh> });
[01:00:15] <prabesh> I am using coffeescript and it is converted to
[01:00:17] <prabesh> above code
[01:00:35] <prabesh> is there anything I should have done differently ?
[01:02:01] <dr0id> yes
[01:02:21] <prabesh> hmm.. which part ?
[01:02:46] <dr0id> my first sentence
[01:03:28] <prabesh> add click on bind or trigger ?
[01:07:24] <prabesh> dr0id: same result with bind
[01:08:23] <dr0id> my first sentence
[01:08:36] <prabesh> I didn't get you
[01:08:38] <prabesh> which one ?
[01:08:47] <dr0id> prove or it didn't happen
[01:09:03] <prabesh> it is happening , how do I prove ?
[01:09:21] <dr0id> ?testcase
[01:09:21] <prabesh> I send you the link , you can see it there

[02:06:53] <Fandekasp> hi people
[02:08:48] <Fandekasp> I'm trying to write some tests about my javascript. I'd like to get a page, and then execute its javascript. Once I get the html code with $.get(), how can I make it execute the js ? In my case, I want to see the google map code and test that my marker is on it.
[02:09:28] <Fandekasp> But $.get() will just grab the template and won't execute its js code, so the google maps code isn't there. Any idea how to load it ?
[02:14:52] <Trudko> I have object which have function test and I want to allow client to write whatever code which will be triggered after my function Test will be called everytime. I am trying to do observer pattern bassilz
[02:15:40] <Trudko> I tried this http://jsfiddle.net/sWj2Y/ but I can't get test() function and then function inside of bind to trigger
[02:49:36] <daGrevis> Hey! Is there anything special with change() event? If I pass anonymous function to it - it executes. if I pass normal function name to it like $('#x').change(x()) and I have function x() - it doesnt calls
[02:49:42] <daGrevis> why is that?
[02:52:42] <daGrevis> work-around i found is change(function() { x() });

[03:37:04] <Trudko> I tried this http://jsfiddle.net/sWj2Y/ but I can't get test() function and then function inside of bind to trigger
[03:56:10] <mazzachre> Anyone have a minute to critique this? http://jsfiddle.net/QLsjR/28/ It is a fontselector widget, and seems to be functioning with a few issues marked as comments... But is it OK to do it this way? Or am I over complicating things?
[04:08:05] <dabear> mazzachre: seems nice. however, shouldn't you keep the <input> updated with the font value as well?
[04:08:22] <dabear> so that a form can be .submit()ed
[04:09:10] <dabear> mazzachre: instea of var foo = new Array; you can use var foo = [];
[04:10:14] <dabear> mazzachre: avoid having many event handlers, use .delegate, .live or .on instead
[04:10:53] <dabear> mazzachre: avoid doing lots of .append() calls. creating the html string and then doing an append at the end is a lot faster
[04:12:47] <Dreamstar> Anyone know a nice "load data on scroll" function?
[04:13:22] <mazzachre> dabear: OK, thx... I do keep the original input updated. The dialog is modal, so you should not "submit the form" in the middle of selection...
[04:14:31] <mazzachre> dabear: And thx for the pointers... I will look that over... In other code I have also generated the code one place, and I am using delegate where it is needed I think... In the font family list selection part.
[04:14:56] <dabear> hm, I see now that the value is indeed set
[04:15:05] <dabear> strange my console doesn't pick that up
[04:15:17] <VictorCL> I read it was a good practive to wrap code in a function like   function() {  codee  } so it wont conflic with other code
[04:15:22] <VictorCL> how was the syntax for this?
[04:15:44] <VictorCL> (function(){code.. })  ?
[04:16:31] <dabear> (function($){code.. })(jQuery)
[04:17:46] <dabear> mazzachre: would anyone ever want to override the font weights?
[04:19:12] <ravenzz> mazzachre I would use this markup instead http://jsfiddle.net/5Ydu5/
[04:20:28] <mazzachre> dabear: I don't know... I hope not :)
[04:21:00] <Dreamstar> Anyone know a nice "load data on scroll" function?
[04:21:42] <mazzachre> ravenzz: But what about size, weight, style, variant, line height etc.? If it was just the family sure, but that is not the case in my app...
[04:22:01] <mazzachre> dabear: Should I just move the weights to private? :)
[04:22:22] <dabear> mazzachre: I don't know, your call
[04:22:55] <dabear> mazzachre: the dialog inputs should probably have arrows to allow increasing/decreasing values
[04:23:07] <dabear> kinda like <input type="number"> in html5

[04:25:50] <mazzachre> dabear: Ya, I thought about that too... It might be in a later revision :)
[04:31:17] <Slartibart> I've got a (huge) html table, a div as container for it and other html as well. I've delegated a click handler to a div above the container, with the container as selector and handler using originalTarget to dtetermine which td was clicked. Am I right assuming that the event travels downwards from root element first(capturing phase). Down to.. *all* individual tds? And then bubble back up to root?
[04:31:42] <Slartibart> Because the page is noticeably slower with larger tables than with small.
[04:32:08] <Slartibart> ..and I'm trying to find out, and understand, why..
[04:33:31] <Slartibart> Slower reacting to clicks that is. But key events as well(moving a cursor around the table using arrow keys)
[04:37:18] <Slartibart> jQuery delegate triggers on bubbling events, right?
[04:46:09] <mazzachre> Slartibart: Many possibilities... If the table is truely huge, then that can cause it by itself... Otherwise having handlers or fancy css can cause problems aswell
[04:47:52] <Slartibart> mazzachre: ~350k td elements? But the code is the same regardless of table size, so I guess something in my code isn't scaling very well(?). I'd just like to find out what it is..
[04:49:48] <Slartibart> I mean, I'm not *moving* the table while pressing a key, or something like that. I guess that would not be very nice to the browsesr :-]..

[04:52:50] <bot-t> Dreamstar, #7841 (Explicitly triggered $(window).scroll ... - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 12 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7841
[04:56:26] <mazzachre> Slartibart: Well check the page responsiveness without your code... if it is still sluggish you should consider paginating or something, if not, then review your code and try enabling it in blocks
[04:56:35] <zChris> Hello, im trying to copy a <img /> with var clone = $('traversing to img parent').clone(). And then i want to add it to the page and i do this with $('html').add($(clone)); but i dont see another image.
[04:58:28] <mazzachre> zChris: probably add it is an element that is shown.. like body or a div...
[04:59:02] <mazzachre> s/is/to
[04:59:31] <zChris> mazzachre, alright ill try that. Can i perhaps use append or html aswell?
[04:59:33] <Slartibart> mazzachre: Fair enough. Guess there's no magical shortcut around that ;-7. Can you say if I was correct about the event traveling part?
[05:00:11] <BinaryKitten> zChris don't wrap a jquery object
[05:00:13] <mazzachre> zChris: using $('body').html() will not show you multiple pictures... In that case, append is the way to go...
[05:01:04] <BinaryKitten> clone returns a jQuery object wrapped copy of the original, wrapping that in $() is excess processing
[05:01:12] <mazzachre> Slartibart: Basically... An event will be transported down the tree until a handler takes it (and stops the bubbling)
[05:02:04] <waza-ari> Hey all, im relativly new to jquery and faced to problems yesterday, maybe someone can help me? 1.) When using appendAll to insert new code, i cant use a selector to select one of the inserted element. 2.) .html() on a TR-element is not working in IE 7/8 cause its "not supported on that element", Is there a way around?
[05:03:22] <mazzachre> Slartibart: So no... you are not correct, the td will get the event, it does not have any handler, so it will bubble up to the tr (with the td as original) that does still not have anything, so the tbody gets it, then the table, then the div...
[05:04:42] <mazzachre> Slartibart: All events eventually bubble to the document and if no handler is found, is thrown away...
[05:04:54] <mazzachre> Slartibart: Or rather, handled by the default handler..

[05:07:10] <BinaryKitten> Dreamstar  you know pestering the bot like that won't give you different answers
[05:07:28] <Dreamstar> BinaryKitten: Yea, I guess
[05:07:48] <BinaryKitten> you might want to google for jQuery way points
[05:07:56] <Slartibart> mazzachre: Makes sense with the td as original target. But now I'm less sure about the capturing abd bubbling phases. Afaik jQuery uses the bubbling phase, nothing bad with that, but the capturing phase is still there. I'll have to google around and read up I guess. Thanks for helping :).
[05:08:10] <Dreamstar> BinaryKitten: Done and done
[05:08:17] <Dreamstar> Nothing that works that great
[05:08:32] <BinaryKitten> jquery WayPoints works great for event handling
[05:08:41] <Dreamstar> Alright, but
[05:08:44] <Dreamstar> I got a code
[05:08:45] <zChris> Whats the css positioning to put a image over another
[05:08:50] <BinaryKitten> you might need to add additional waypoints within the newly added dom stuff
[05:08:57] <BinaryKitten> got a code
[05:08:59] <BinaryKitten> ?

[05:13:48] <dabear> waza-ari: there is no appendAll method in jquery
[05:15:14] <waza-ari> dabear: lol, your right. im using .append()... sometimes it helps to think before writing...
[05:16:23] <Dreamstar> Okay, I've got a problem with this code; http://pastebin.com/g6umgH9J Lets say it fetches 5 rows of data. The problem is when you scroll down it copies the already fetched data.
[05:17:13] <dabear> waza-ari: use .append for tr elements in ie
[05:18:04] <waza-ari> dabear: i need the inner html of that tr element
[05:18:24] <waza-ari> sorry, i need the tr element itself including the inner html
[05:18:42] <dabear> waza-ari: you can still read the innerhtml without issues
[05:18:51] <dabear> you are looking for outerhtml

[05:28:30] <waza-ari> Dreamstar: i know :)
[05:28:51] <Dreamstar> You don't have to code towards ie7 anymore
[05:29:19] <waza-ari> Dreamstar: but it does not work in ie8 either, and thats the most current ie version available in XP for example
[05:29:30] <Dreamstar> Yea
[05:29:45] <Dreamstar> You should work towards ie8, thats right

[05:30:07] <Dreamstar> ;<
[05:30:21] <Chib> yah, mine too sadly lol
[05:30:30] <Dreamstar> :)
[05:30:31] <Chib> oh well, we all have ff installed
[05:30:35] <Chib> ff 3.4! yeahhhhh
[05:30:36] <Dreamstar> yea
[05:30:39] <Dreamstar> :D
[05:30:59] <waza-ari> So any idea to get .html() reading from tr element working in ie8?
[05:33:16] <Dreamstar> Not rly, sorry
[05:33:16] <Dreamstar> ;<
[05:33:49] <ciro_nunes> anybody uses jshint or jslint?
[05:34:15] <waza-ari> Damn it... any other way to get the inner html in ie8
[05:34:29] <aljoscha> Hey, I wanted to use a custom theme for jquery ui and tried the themeroller. but the include of jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css doesn't have any effect. any idea why?
[05:34:55] <aljoscha> tried it with the tabs code from the demo
[05:37:31] <zChris> Is there away to get pixels to screen of a div?
[05:42:35] <Chib> so the js .outerHTML doesn't work either waza-ari?
[05:49:57] <waza-ari> Chib: I'll give it a try, one second please
[05:53:22] <Sean-Der> Whats the best answer for realtime updates from PHP? Just do a .load or .get every X seconds?
[05:53:57] <Sean-Der> Or do a small check that checks if the DB has had a change THEN do a major query
[05:56:35] <zChris> Hmm, my animation works in correctly in Firefox and Chrome but not IE. It animates css properties left, top and height.
[05:56:56] <kkuno> uff
[05:56:58] <kkuno> hi :|
[05:57:08] <zChris> Ah i think i had "old kompability" on in ie :)
[05:57:21] <kkuno> I need a way to pass an additional parameter to ajax success callback
[05:58:19] <kkuno> mmm wait
[05:58:21] <kkuno> I got it
[05:58:26] <zChris> rolleyes :)
[05:58:56] <waza-ari> Chib: its the same error when using .html() - this object does not support that method
[05:59:47] <Trudko> I have object which have function test and I want to allow client to write whatever code which will be triggered after my function Test will be called everytime. I am trying to do observer pattern bassilz
[05:59:49] <Trudko> I tried this http://jsfiddle.net/sWj2Y/ but I can't get test() function and then function inside of bind to trigger
[06:01:13] <waza-ari> Chib: the JS outerHTML is not implemented in FF, while in IE innerHTML and outerHTML is not working. crap...
[06:04:45] <jstonne> Trudko: I think the use of .bind() here is incorrect.
[06:05:35] <Trudko> jstonne: would not be supprised :) i mean it does not work :) Do you understand what I wanted to do? If yes how to achieve that?
[06:06:18] <ahandy> question.. im working on a custom scrollbar.. i need to know how to check if the content inside a page doesn't fit inside the browser height. how would i do that
[06:10:12] <jstonne> Trudco: You could add another function called MyObject.onTest(function(){}); that receives a callback function.. keep it somewhere as a private variable inside your MyObject scope, and execute it when test(); is executed.
[06:13:41] <jstonne> Trudco: http://jsfiddle.net/3eznN/1/
[06:15:26] <jstonne> ahandy: $(document).height(); returns you the height of your document. $(window).height(); returns you the height of the viewable area.
[06:17:53] <jstonne> ahandy: So from here I think you should know how to carry on? :-)
[06:20:02] <Dreamstar> Okay, I've got a problem with this code; http://pastebin.com/g6umgH9J Lets say it fetches 5 rows of data. The problem is when you scroll down it copies the already fetched data.
[06:20:09] <jstonne> ahandy: In case you're dealing with custom scrollbar within a <div> container… the best way to determine the content height is to use the native scrollHeight property. $('div')[0].scrollHeight.
[06:21:17] <sphinxxx> dreamstar, any code in window.scroll event should be debounced
[06:21:32] <sphinxxx> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[06:22:07] <Dreamstar> What are you saying?
[06:22:10] <dagon666> hello. I would like to pass an array to the php script via post request. The problem is that the array is generated dynamically and its length can vary. It works when I do i.e: { 'data[1]' : 'val1', 'data[2]' : 'val2' }, but I dont know how to generate such object dynamically
[06:22:47] <sphinxxx> you don't want to run code directly in window.scroll because its inefficient
[06:23:09] <sphinxxx> if you throttle or debounce it (see that plugin I linked), it prevents the code from running constantly
[06:23:55] <Dreamstar> sphinxxx: Alright, thanks
[06:25:53] <jstonne> dagon666: It's best to json.stringify your javascript array, and json_decode() it into php array.
[06:29:47] <dnsdds> Inside the drop event of a jQuery UI droppable, how can I select the original draggable element?
[06:30:21] <jstonne> dagon666: Oh you might want to check out $.param() too.
[06:33:18] <jstonne> dnsdds: drop: function(event, ui) { ui.draggable; // This is the item that is being dropped };
[06:34:10] <dnsdds> jstonne: Awesome, thanks so much!
[06:35:42] <jstonne> dnsdds: You're welcome.
[06:36:06] <jstonne> I'm totally bored. Ask me anything.
[06:40:26] <Eviltwin> jstonne: Where do babies come from?
[06:40:52] <aple> Anyone know how to do this slideout effect? http://thechristmastree.org.uk (if you scroll down a little, the sign starts sliding out to the left - depending on how fast you scroll down)
[06:43:03] <jstonne> Eviltwin: Well, it's best if I demonstrate. :)

[06:53:13] <djQuery> yeah I just had to move it up into scope
[06:54:33] <waza-ari> hey, i have on last question for today: Suppose i insert an <tr> element via .append() like $(someObject).append('<td id="myTr">...</tr>); After inserting i cannot access it via $('#myTr'). Why?
[06:55:57] <jstonne> waza-ari: That someObject, is it already on the document body?
[06:56:20] <rahmen> Hi! I have a function that fetches information and then populates a table. I want to loop this so I always get up-to-date information in the table. But the updates might take a while. So I have this execute function and want to call it after it's done or maybe even wait X seconds after it's done and then call it again. How do I achieve this?
[06:56:32] <Eviltwin> waza-ari: http://jsfiddle.net/e5bKe/
[06:56:42] <waza-ari> jstonne: it was, yeah. But i was removed though.
[06:56:51] <Eviltwin> rahmen: setTimeout
[06:56:55] <Eviltwin> Google it
[06:57:08] <VictorCL> if I have set an element with click .. how can I disable this click on this element when some event happens?
[06:57:24] <Eviltwin> VictorCL: see ?.unbind
[06:57:30] <VictorCL> ok
[06:57:46] <jstonne> waza-ari: Assign your tr to a variable. var myTr = $('<tr></tr>');  $(someObject).append(myTr); myTry.doSomethingjQuery();
[06:58:31] <chrisvwebdev> hello all
[06:58:33] <waza-ari> jstonne: thats hardly possible, since i have to use it in two entirly different functions
[06:59:03] <jstonne> There's no way of accessing it via its id selector if it's not on the document body.
[06:59:33] <Eviltwin> No way of accessing it via any non-context selector
[06:59:54] <rahmen> Eviltwin: I want to loop it, setTimeout will only work once? Here's my first try with setInterval(): http://pastebin.com/XbXLqFLL But execute returns before the fetchInfo() is returned...
[07:00:04] <Eviltwin> rahmen: Look up setInterval
[07:00:19] <Eviltwin> Or use setTimeout recursively
[07:01:03] <jstonne> Eviltwin: I'm trying to beat your speed in replying I guess I'm slow in forming my words.
[07:01:57] <rahmen> Eviltwin: I have looked up setInterval. The problem is that I want to wait for fetchInfo() before I return the execute function.
[07:02:16] <Eviltwin> Then you use setTimeout recursively
[07:03:12] <Eviltwin> http://pastebin.com/JrGf8RY6
[07:04:44] <rahmen> Eviltwin: Ok... that should work, yes. Thanks!
[07:05:08] <djQuery> VictorCL: I like using on for these type of things   $(document).on('click', '.clickable', function(){$(this).toggleClass('clicked'); }) then when I want to make it not clickable I just remove the .clickable class from the elemenent...     $('.clickable).removeClass('.clickable').addClass('.clickableDisabled');
[07:05:22] <jstonne> rahmen: http://pastebin.com/WCEZYFy2  (Eviltwin beat me to it)
[07:05:56] <VictorCL> djQuery,  thanks that's another way of doing it :)
[07:06:43] <waza-ari> Eviltwin: What do you mean by non-context selector? Suppose i only have the id of a recently inserted element. No way to select it?
[07:07:18] <Eviltwin> waza-ari: Did you recently insert it into the DOM or just some arbitrary collection somewhere?
[07:07:48] <jstonne> waza-ari: Get it back via $(someObject).find('#myTr');
[07:08:01] <jstonne> Eviltwin: It's not in the DOM.
[07:08:11] <jstonne> Eviltwin: (and I just assumed it) ;-)
[07:08:14] <waza-ari> Eviltwin: i used append() on a jquery  object of a table
[07:08:29] <waza-ari> so jstonne is right i guess :)
[07:08:31] <Eviltwin> ...
[07:08:34] <Eviltwin> Is the table in the DOM?
[07:09:02] <Eviltwin> Here: http://jsfiddle.net/e5bKe/
[07:09:04] <Eviltwin> See?
[07:09:10] <Eviltwin> It works just fine when it's in the DOM
[07:09:20] <waza-ari> Seems i have some heavy unterstanding gaps...
[07:09:50] <Eviltwin> Start here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[07:09:54] <waza-ari> Hm... the table is not inserted dynamicly, if thats your question
[07:09:55] <Eviltwin> Really understand everything there
[07:10:08] <Eviltwin> Then once you're done with that, start this: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[07:10:11] <Eviltwin> And also really understand it
[07:17:30] <shaDykhaN> can someone explain how open source license work?
[07:17:57] <shaDykhaN> just for example say if i use twitter bootstrap for a website and some company wants to buy it
[07:18:12] <shaDykhaN> would there be issues selling it?
[07:18:31] <jstonne> What type of license is it first? GPL/MIT/Apache/BSD?
[07:18:45] <Eviltwin> Apache looks like

[07:19:37] <Meekoh> Question on .widget(): I want to access and edit a variable local to the widget instance inside a draw loop (i.e. setInterval() ). Is there a best practice on where to put the data?
[07:19:40] <shaDykhaN> thank you
[07:21:04] <ajpiano> Meekoh: store it on the widget instance
[07:21:35] <ajpiano> this.drawLoop = setInterval( $.proxy( this.draw, this ), 250 );
[07:22:03] <Meekoh> ajpiano: Blowing my mind. I will check out this $.proxy
[07:23:14] <ajpiano> the proxy part isn't really relevant
[07:23:27] <ajpiano> that will just make it so that the function (this.draw) stays in the same 'this
[07:23:30] <ajpiano> 'this'
[07:23:42] <Meekoh> Well, the problem I am always having working on this stuff is that I never understand what 'this' is.
[07:23:58] <Meekoh> So in my callback, 'this' kept being set to the window object and I couldn't access my local data anymore.
[07:24:14] <Eviltwin> Meekoh: That's what the proxy is for
[07:24:28] <Meekoh> Eviltwin: Yeah I get it. I'd never seen that before.
[07:24:36] <Eviltwin> It effectively locks "this" to be whatever you specify
[07:25:25] <ajpiano> oh, yeah, that ^^
[07:25:33] <ajpiano> so the proxy is a useful thing for you to have also :p
[07:25:42] <ajpiano> but not what i was attempting to demonstrate, just used to running into that problem
[07:25:54] <Eviltwin> I ususally take the other approach
[07:26:06] <Eviltwin> Where you shove this into a var
[07:26:14] <Eviltwin> And then use an anonymous function
[07:26:15] <ajpiano> i got really bored of that
[07:26:41] <WebDragon> anyone worked with the new Fancybox 2.0.4 yet?
[07:27:32] <VictorCL> how can I check if an array exists inside an object¿
[07:27:41] <VictorCL>  dataObject.id
[07:27:42] <Eviltwin> You can use a truthy test
[07:27:51] <VictorCL> if(dataObject.id.lenght)   ?
[07:28:03] <Meekoh> Can you use $.proxy with .click(function()) and other triggers too?
[07:28:14] <Eviltwin> Meekoh: You can use $.proxy anywhere something takes a function
[07:28:19] <ajpiano> Meekoh: yes, for everything
[07:28:24] <Meekoh> hawwwt.
[07:28:34] <Eviltwin> Including outside of jQuery
[07:28:34] <ajpiano> Meekoh: $.proxy is essentially logically equivalent to
[07:28:39] <Meekoh> this is my new favorite thing
[07:28:40] <ajpiano> ?mdn function.prototype.bind @ Meekoh
[07:28:44] <Meekoh> GET IT??? :D :D
[07:28:47] <Eviltwin> Like setTimeout($.proxy(this.myfunc,this),1234)
[07:28:48] <ajpiano> damn botty
[07:29:09] <Eviltwin> It achieves the same effect, just slower
[07:29:12] <WebDragon> having trouble figuring out how to properly set the defaults for fancybox without modifying fancybox itself
[07:29:21] <ajpiano> Meekoh: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[07:29:32] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: ya, that's why i said "essentially logically equivalent"
[07:29:40] <ajpiano> :D
[07:30:32] <WebDragon> the documentation on the new fancyapps page mentons $.fancybox.defaults but doesn't have any examples of usage, and what I've tried so far based on how I thought it worked failed totally
[07:30:37] <Eviltwin> What pisses me off is that (at least in Chrome), you can't step into a bound function
[07:30:42] <Eviltwin> Or at least in the version I have
[07:30:56] <Eviltwin> It just resumes when you try to step in
[07:30:59] <WebDragon> then again I didn't have a lot of time to spend on it at that moment so I probably missed something
[07:31:45] <Eviltwin> WebDragon: I've had numerous occasions where I didn't have enough time to learn the ins and outs of a plugin so I wrote one myself
[07:31:51] <Eviltwin> Not sure if I advocate it
[07:31:54] <WebDragon> heh
[07:32:12] <Meekoh> So is this the "normal" way to deal with this problem? in .widget::create() you set a bunch of stuff this.localvar = "whatever"; and then do this.element.click($.proxy(function(){ ... }, this));  ?
[07:32:18] <WebDragon> in every other respect it does what I want, the way I want it done. and the new FB 2.04 is a vast improvement over the previous model
[07:32:31] <WebDragon> no need to reinvent the wheel here
[07:32:35] <ajpiano> Meekoh: yes it is
[07:32:49] <Meekoh> ajpiano: Awesomeness.
[07:32:51] <WebDragon> just wish the defaults-setting process was more thoroughly documented for the new refactored release
[07:32:53] <ajpiano> Meekoh: those aren't "local variables" per se, they are instance variables
[07:32:56] <Eviltwin> Meekoh: Of course now "this" doesn't refer to the clicked element but rather whatever "this" was in the previous scope
[07:33:12] <Meekoh> Yup yup I get it. I want them stores on the instance of the widget.
[07:33:31] <WebDragon> it mentions it here http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#docs but doesn't say whether it's a variable, function, or object
[07:33:51] <Eviltwin> Alternatively you can do this.localvar = "whatever"; var widget = this; this.element.click(function(){ widget.localvar });
[07:34:04] <Eviltwin> Which is what I prefer to do when it's not a named function
[07:34:12] <ajpiano> WebDragon: "You can pass these options as key/value object to fancybox()"
[07:34:15] <WebDragon> I can pass the values to the .fancybox() call
[07:34:20] <Pallet> Hi all
[07:34:25] <WebDragon> but I want to set these options globally
[07:34:32] <WebDragon> preferably without modifying fancybox itself
[07:34:36] <Eviltwin> WebDragon: You might be SOL
[07:34:45] <WebDragon> it mentions right below that point about $.fancybox.defaults
[07:34:49] <Meekoh> Eviltwin: makes sense. I think I'm going to name most of these since they are complicated enough but will keep that in mind.
[07:34:59] <ajpiano> WebDragon: i assume that's also an object
[07:34:59] <WebDragon> I was just hoping anyone here had done that, and knew how the thing worked
[07:35:09] <ajpiano> $.fancybox.defaults.width = 400;
[07:35:14] <Pallet> I need a scrollable grid, that's simple, I need to load it with a php object with is a list of company addresses, anyone got any suggestions ?
[07:35:36] <Eviltwin> jwysiwyg was pissing me off the other day
[07:35:54] <xrated> Pallet, create a table with the data and use one of the many jQuery table plugins?
[07:35:55] <WebDragon> oh so individual elements should work that way?
[07:36:14] <WebDragon> and here I was, trying to figure out how to pass it a hash of the defaults like you can within the function
[07:36:21] <Eviltwin> $.extend($.fancybox.defaults, { /* your global customization */});
[07:36:32] * WebDragon blinks
[07:36:52] <WebDragon> clearly I spend way too much time being a jack-of-all-trades and not enough time mastering any one of them
[07:36:52] <Pallet> xrated, "create a table with the data" excuse my stupidity, but what do you mean by that bit ?
[07:37:06] <queso> Is there a way to specify an element that does not have a class?  Like, p^.class?
[07:37:15] <WebDragon> I need to alter my job requirements :D
[07:38:57] <jstonne> I'm not sure if :not() could help.. p:not([class])
[07:39:09] <Eviltwin> p:not(.class)
[07:39:20] <Eviltwin> queso: p:not(.class)
[07:39:28] <Eviltwin> queso: http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[07:39:38] <Meekoh> queso: Do you mean elements that have NO class, or elements that do not have the specific class "ClassName" ?
[07:39:56] <Eviltwin> I assume he meant does not have a specific class
[07:40:01] <Eviltwin> But I could be wrong about that
[07:40:06] <Meekoh> Right, it was unclear.
[07:40:11] <queso> Yes, you're right Eviltwin.

[07:53:32] <ajpiano> Meekoh: they're the html5 slide deck from google, http://slides.html5rocks.com/
[07:54:00] <Meekoh> ajpiano: Thanks
[07:54:23] <ajpiano> which has subsequently had some nifty features added to it
[07:55:43] <Pallet> all the grid/table scrollers I'm looking for a super over the top,
[07:55:44] <Pallet> ;)
[07:56:00] <Pallet> i just want a simple scrollable selectable grid
[07:58:30] <nail_> (quite off-topic) Say I have a bunch a "tracking pixels" to add on a page, but I don't want any impact for the user (so no blocking "Waiting for...." idling at the bottom when the page loads if some tracker is under heavy load).. Does https://gist.github.com/9fe61be4923edbf076c2 looks like an acceptable solution?
[07:59:21] <nail_> Or would you have any other suggestion?
[08:01:08] <Eviltwin> Probably
[08:01:10] <Eviltwin> Try it and see
[08:02:23] <nail_> As far as I tested that makes it, but it looks too simple to be bulletproof :)
[08:03:38] <nail_> I'm wondering if setTimeout(...,0) will really append the handler to the event loop for any browser so it really executes after the onload event
[08:03:49] <Eviltwin> JavaScript isn't designed to take bullets
[08:03:54] <Eviltwin> At best its bullet-resistant
[08:04:25] <Eviltwin> nail_: In most browsers I work with, it does
[08:04:36] <Eviltwin> Some people use like 1 or 7 to be safe
[08:04:49] <Eviltwin> I think 13ms is about the true granularity
[08:05:01] <Eviltwin> Based on Resig's research
[08:05:01] <Eviltwin> http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/
[08:07:05] <cambrian> I have a page with a bunch of dynamicly generated drop downs, all with the same class name. On form submit, I want to look at all of the drop downs with that class name and make sure they chose a value of 1,2, or 3. If they didn't choose an option (option 0) then they get an alert message. How can I do this?
[08:07:31] <Pilate> iterate over the dropdowns and check their selectedIndex
[08:07:42] <Pilate> if you find something you dont like, alert
[08:08:44] <Eviltwin> Or use a disgusting selector but get it done without having to loop yourself
[08:09:16] <Eviltwin> Likely a performance hit but not sure
[08:10:03] <cambrian> Should I use the class name selector with the .each() method and have my logic in there?
[08:10:32] <Eviltwin> cambrian: Either $(".dropdownclass").each(function(){switch($(this).val()){case 1:case 2:case 3:break;default:alert("Failure!");return false;}});
[08:10:43] <Eviltwin> I apoligize for the one-lineness, you can jsbeautify that
[08:11:07] <nail_> Eviltwin: ok, what I was afraid of is the timer event being inserted in the events stack inbetween the registered onload events, (so, say we have func1 and func2 registered, with func1 having some setTimeout(func3, 0), I'd expect it to always execute in the func1/func2/func3 order
[08:11:14] <cambrian> Eviltwin: Thank you for your help. I will try that out.
[08:11:22] <Eviltwin> Or if($(".dropdownclass:not([value=1]):not([value=2]):not([value=3])").length){alert("Failure!")}
[08:12:22] <chrisvwebdev> +++++rep for fixingjquery.com
[08:12:29] <Meekoh> That was like my favorite slideshow ever.
[08:12:39] <Meekoh> ++++++rep, I guess?
[08:12:55] <Meekoh> esp slide titled "IE will straight up kill you if..."
[08:15:46] <Eviltwin> cambrian: http://jsfiddle.net/A4mry/
[08:16:39] <Eviltwin> If the only bad value is 0, you can simplify both to: http://jsfiddle.net/A4mry/1/
[08:17:35] <cambrian> Eviltwin: Thank you, that is exactly what I needed, and it works!
[08:18:33] <cambrian> Eviltwin: What is Failure Y indicate? There seems to be two ways to provide feedback. Is there a reason to provide both?
[08:18:47] <Eviltwin> cambrian: Sorry, I was saying you could do either of those
[08:18:52] <Eviltwin> They're effectively identical
[08:19:16] <TehRabbitt> okay, i'm trying to grab the input from a form, and process the input onclick() using the submit button on that page.  So far i'm able to pull the data from the form, but i'm not able to do the onclick since the button's ID= changes... only saving grace is that the end of the submit button's ID will always end with " :printButton"
[08:19:19] <cambrian> Eviltwin: Yeah, got it. Thank you.
[08:19:23] <TehRabbitt> any ideas?
[08:19:55] <TehRabbitt> var printButton = document.getElementById('auditLaptop:printButton');
[08:19:55] <TehRabbitt> printButton.onclick = function()
[08:19:59] <TehRabbitt> thats what I *was* using
[08:20:02] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: Usually if IDs are changing, you've done something horribly wrong
[08:20:05] <TehRabbitt> but the ID changes so it doesn't work
[08:20:25] <Trudko> Guys as far I as I know IE8 does not support target.event ?!
[08:20:32] <Eviltwin> It it an <input> or <button>?
[08:20:34] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: Well I didn't design the form, i'm just desiging the code to grab the data from it... it's for a label printer... and the IDs are supposed to change since it's dynamic (xhtml using jsf)
[08:21:21] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: It's using Jakarta / Tomcat to parse the xhtml pages into HTML, so id=printbutton becomes laptopAudit:printButton or systemAudit.printButton, or serverAudit.printButton or etc....
[08:21:28] <TehRabbitt> theres many many many possibilities
[08:21:39] <Eviltwin> If it's an input, try $(document).on("click","input[id$=printButton]",function(e){...})
[08:21:45] <TehRabbitt> depending on what page you're on "systemAudit.xhtml"
[08:21:46] <Eviltwin> Actaully
[08:21:46] <Eviltwin> Screw it
[08:21:51] <Eviltwin> If it's an input, try $(document).on("click","[id$=printButton]",function(e){...})
[08:22:04] <Eviltwin> Now if anything is clicked whose ID ends with "printButton"
[08:22:07] <Eviltwin> You'll be notified
[08:22:19] <TehRabbitt> hm so if i place that in the onload it would notify me?
[08:22:26] <Eviltwin> Assuming you're using jQuery 1.7+
[08:22:32] <TehRabbitt> i'm using the latest jQuery yes
[08:22:34] <djQuery> why would you change the id when the id never gets submited to the server does it just the name.
[08:22:34] <Eviltwin> You can place it anywhere you please
[08:22:45] <RLa> how one constructs list of dom jquery object representing list of dom objects?
[08:22:50] <TehRabbitt> djQuery: i'm not changing the ID.. Jakarta is.
[08:22:56] <Eviltwin> djQuery: Creative namespacing solution? :P
[08:22:57] <TehRabbitt> again that side of it is not my code
[08:23:37] <TehRabbitt> djQuery: honestly I find it rather annoying / retarted, but I have to work around it, if it didn't change, I would have been finished with this by now :-\
[08:24:31] <kkuno> hi I'm experiencing a weird problem loading a php file with ajax:
[08:24:46] <kkuno> if I use an element   "<title>"
[08:25:00] <kkuno> I can't search for elements inside that element
[08:25:04] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: so as long as try $(document).on("click","[id$=printButton]",function(e){...}) is on the page somewhere, it would display if I click something with the id PrintButton?
[08:25:08] <TehRabbitt> printButton*
[08:25:24] <kkuno> if I use any other names, it works..
[08:25:38] <kkuno> so is "title" a special word somehow?
[08:27:04] <kkuno> something is going wrong :|
[08:28:33] <jstonne> kkuno: <title> is used in the <head>?
[08:29:19] <jstonne> kkuno: Is that like an XML file? You're better off doing $.parseXML
[08:29:33] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: It works via magic, yes
[08:29:36] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: lol
[08:29:41] <TehRabbitt> 		try $(document).on("click","[id$=printButton]",function(e){alert("IT WORKED!";})	
[08:29:41] <TehRabbitt>  should work?
[08:30:00] <TehRabbitt> becuse it doesnt :-(
[08:30:06] <TehRabbitt> no alert window
[08:30:23] <Eviltwin> Oh sorry, it's probably because its not quoted
[08:30:29] <TehRabbitt> huh
[08:30:35] <kkuno> jscheel, well the same file with .xml extension works good
[08:30:37] <Eviltwin> $(document).on("click",'[id$="printButton"]',function(e){alert("IT WORKED!";})
[08:30:43] <Eviltwin> Try that
[08:30:44] <kkuno> but not if I use a .php
[08:31:01] <kkuno> oh yeah that's the problem :D
[08:31:11] <kkuno> (maybe) title is used in head
[08:31:20] <jstonne> kkuno: in your ajax options, you'll probably need to set the content type to xml.
[08:32:15] <jstonne> kkuno: dataType: 'xml'
[08:32:38] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: http://jsfiddle.net/wNsF2/
[08:32:45] <jstonne> kkuno: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/  (see dataType)
[08:34:39] <kkuno> jstonne, yeah thanks, I used datatype xml before, I was sure there were problems with it
[08:34:46] <kkuno> it works now
[08:34:53] <jstonne> ok kuno
[08:35:30] <queso> Is there a way to select elements where the css property display is not 'none'?
[08:35:43] <Eviltwin> queso: Look at http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[08:35:43] <jstonne> :visible
[08:35:57] <queso> Eviltwin, jstonne: ty
[08:36:03] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: no dice X_X

[08:46:51] <DofLeFou> Anyone knows of a good Inline Source Code Editor
[08:47:26] <DofLeFou> I have some .css and .js …. I would like to endble the user to edit from the web
[08:47:57] <WebDragon> jsfiddle ;D
[08:48:18] <DofLeFou> can that be added to an app
[08:48:48] <DofLeFou> I m currently using trying TinyMCE …. but that is not a source code editor
[08:49:43] <WebDragon> I was being facetious :)
[08:49:58] <DofLeFou> do you know of a good one/

[08:50:53] <sorahn> hey guys, how hard is it to strip off the hashtag on a url?
[08:51:07] <sphinxxx> sorahn for what purpose?
[08:51:27] <Pallet> does anyone know of a simple version of http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/select_single_row.html
[08:51:50] <Pallet> basically I need a scrollable, row selectable table?
[08:52:04] <sorahn> our login tracker uses a hashtag to track the logins, but jquery mobile uses hashtags to load pages.  So if our tracking tag is present the jquery mobile pages don't load at all.
[08:52:08] <Pallet> I've been looking at loads and they are all complicated
[08:52:09] <sorahn> sphinxxx: ^
[08:53:28] <sphinxxx> sorahn i don't know that javascript can change the url without actually redirecting
[08:53:30] <Pallet> anyone ?
[08:55:06] <Pilate> sphinxxx: html5 history api
[08:56:49] <cambrian> Eviltwin: Hi again, I am having an issue where the code you helped me right is conflicting with a .validate() method.  The error message is tirggering but the form submit is still going through. https://gist.github.com/25ca959d839a8c5ab709
[08:58:08] <imarklee> join #jquery-dev
[08:59:50] <sphinxxx> ah
[09:05:35] <KevinFlint> Textarea's placeholder overlaps the ul-li list on Chrome => http://jsfiddle.net/kevinflint/G7yrY/  anyone already got this one fixd?
[09:05:58] <imarklee> sorry typo, not meant to spam
[09:07:04] <djQuery> KevinFlint: looks fin to me on chrome
[09:07:27] <djQuery> KevinFlint: chrome 17.0.963.12 dev-m
[09:08:41] <KevinFlint> djQuery: I'm using v16.* and it is kinda annoying to see the placeholder overlaps when not focused :(
[09:10:01] <djQuery> cambrian: just get a blank white page on that link
[09:10:04] <queso> Is there a convenient way to select elements of a table column?
[09:11:09] <djQuery> queso: you mean like the 3rd td of every row or something?
[09:11:27] <queso> djQuery: Yeah
[09:11:28] <Meekoh> What does extending $.ui.mouse get you exactly?
[09:11:34] <djQuery> KevinFlint: got it to open
[09:12:53] <djQuery> KevinFlint:  $("#classAttendanceForm").submit(function(e) {      then in the part where you have determined that they havent filled it in correctly you need to do a e.preventDefault()
[09:14:11] <KevinFlint> djQuery: Wrong send bro? :)
[09:14:49] <djQuery> cambrian:  where you currently have $("#classAttendanceForm").preventDefault(); needs to be e.preventDefulat(); and the function that is bound to the be like $("#classAttendanceForm").submit(function(e) {
[09:14:59] <djQuery> KevinFlint: yeah sorry bro
[09:15:16] <KevinFlint> djQuery: heh no problem bro
[09:16:22] <PlaqueSaque> anyone knows why http://jsfiddle.net/BrS2Y/ doesn't show the current day per default?
[09:17:05] <PlaqueSaque> and if it's not possible to show the current day per default, is it possible to click on the 'Today' button via jquery?
[09:17:14] <djQuery> PlaqueSaque: you would proably want to ask in the google caledar channel there is nothing jquery realted to that
[09:17:31] <PlaqueSaque> see my second line ;)
[09:19:16] <Meekoh> Aha you need to call this._mouseInit() in your _init function for any of the stuff to kick in.
[09:20:46] <djQuery> PlaqueSaque: no because the iframe is a different domain than the main page
[09:21:03] <PlaqueSaque> damned!
[09:21:29] <djQuery> PlaqueSaque: There is most likely a parameter that you can pass in the url of the iframe to tell it what day if you ask in google calendar rather than here
[09:22:20] <PlaqueSaque> well, i've been searching for hours already
[09:23:26] <cambrian> djQuery: Thank you. That worked!
[09:27:08] <Meekoh> is there a touch equivalent to $.ui.mouse (in development)?
[09:28:45] <Eviltwin> Like this? https://github.com/jhlagado/Mouse.Touch
[09:30:10] <djQuery> queso: $('tr>td:nth-child(3)');
[09:31:18] <queso> djQuery: if I have a col element selected, is there a way to figure out which nth-child # it is?
[09:31:28] <djQuery> .index
[09:31:43] <djQuery> queso: was allready makin an example give me a min
[09:31:52] <queso> djQuery: nice, thanks
[09:48:44] <devoldmx> Hi, I have a question about jquery
[09:50:09] <devoldmx> how can I persist a Json Object I created
[09:53:49] <djQuery> queso: http://jsbin.com/oqizif/edit#javascript,html,live
[09:54:29] <djQuery> devoldmx: var x =yourobject
[09:56:35] <angryasian> hey guys.  I'm trying to send a get request from page A to page B.  I need to know in jquery mobile when is the earliest the window.location.search field gets updated so that I can use that data
[09:56:59] <angryasian> this may be considered as a general question and not really specific to jquery mobile
[09:57:21] <devoldmx> @djQuery Thanks, I did that but when I try to aceess that object from another page it doesn't load. I know that's a expected behavior is there any other way to persis it?
[09:58:07] <robin_sz> is this the place to post my new years wish?
[09:58:14] <queso> djQuery: thanks!
[09:58:48] * robin_sz wishes for a Jquery UI  drag-and-drop visual design tool, like FlashBuilder, but without flash :)
[09:59:08] <dabear> robin_sz: nobody stops you form creating that your self
[09:59:18] <robin_sz> dabear, not true
[09:59:34] <dabear> yes, it is not not true
[09:59:46] <robin_sz> my lack of time and talent prevent me
[10:00:08] <dabear> yeah, so pay someone to do it for you :p
[10:00:15] <robin_sz> I'd try, but it would be an un-holy mess
[10:01:19] <robin_sz> hmm, it might even be possible as a browser app ...
[10:01:26] <MightyMike> is fadeIn a destructive method?
[10:02:36] <djQuery> devoldmx: oh you mean persist it across different pages? then you would need to save it to a cookie or such. hml5 has a lot of new storage methods.
[10:04:21] <djQuery> robin_sz: cloud9?
[10:05:26] <foxhoundz> Odd question
[10:05:34] <foxhoundz> Why is jQuery called jQuery?
[10:05:40] <foxhoundz> What's the "Query" for?
[10:06:04] <erichynds> querying the DOM
[10:07:16] <dabear> the better question is what does the j in jquery stand for?
[10:07:52] <todd_work> john?
[10:08:16] <dabear> john query?
[10:08:17] <dabear> heh
[10:09:24] <MightyMike> Haha "John"? wth? Lol I think it stands for Javascript
[10:10:14] <foxhoundz> >Document
[10:10:22] <foxhoundz> hay. Where's our resident JavaScript interpreter
[10:10:38] <Meekoh> I'm extending $.ui.mouse and need to do something on _mouseDown, but if I overwrite _mouseDown then I lose all the $.ui.mouse functionality. How do I just add some behavoir rather than override it?
[10:10:48] <todd_work> MightyMike: is joke.
[10:10:56] <todd_work> john resig.
[10:11:23] <MightyMike> Lol i know... I just thought it was funny
[10:11:32] <ajpiano> Meekoh: $.ui.mouse.prototype._mouseDown.apply( this ); doSomeOtherSutff();
[10:11:51] <Meekoh> ajpiano: Ahhh makes sense.
[10:12:06] <ajpiano> Meekoh: in ui 1.9 there will be a super method for that sort of thing but not in 1.8
[10:12:17] <MightyMike> can anybody tell me if fadeIn a destructive method?
[10:12:50] <ajpiano> what do you mean by "destructive" ... it leaves a style attribute on the element, but that's about it
[10:13:06] <kelly1212> im dumbfounded
[10:13:44] <WebDragon> it eats your brains?
[10:14:13] <MightyMike> Destructive as in, it brakes chaining. I can never seem to get the fade effect work onChaining
[10:14:24] <ajpiano> MightyMike: it definitely doesn't break chaining
[10:14:25] <WebDragon> and then in a fit of paradox, devours itself and disappears into a chronosynclastic infundibulum
[10:14:34] <Meekoh> ajpiano: Seems not quite right. Shouldn't you need to pass in the event too somehow?
[10:14:47] <ajpiano> Meekoh: yah, you probably need to do .apply( this, arguments );
[10:15:01] <kelly1212> for some reason i can get this page to wor
[10:15:02] <kelly1212> k
[10:15:04] <kelly1212> https://gist.github.com/1528967
[10:15:07] <Meekoh> ajpiano: Not quite it either ;) I'lll poke around.
[10:15:08] <dood4> Does anyone know of a jquery plugin where you can combine multiple rssfeeds into one?
[10:15:13] <dood4> sorting by date and such
[10:15:23] <kelly1212> but when i put the jquery in my rails app i need to use a comma between the css xelectors #list and .clickbale
[10:15:37] <MightyMike> I use SimplePie for PHP for Multiple RSS
[10:17:06] <todd_work> kelly1212:  try $(this).find('.hidden').slideToggle();
[10:18:39] <dood4> Does anyone know of a jquery plugin where you can combine multiple rssfeeds into one?
[10:18:45] <Meekoh> ajpiano: $.ui.mouse.prototype._mouseDown.call( this, event );  seems to be the winner
[10:18:52] <ajpiano> ya that would do it too
[10:19:08] <Meekoh> I guess apply needs an array at the end... I am learning slowly.
[10:20:23] <todd_work> dood4: i don't. but you could extend an object with JSON from each RSS return, i suppose.
[10:20:55] <todd_work> dood4:  i'll mock up a fiddle.
[10:21:28] <dood4> todd_work - yeah that could work. I'm currently using gfeed, that uses googles reader api they provide some functionality, but oddly enough not combination of feeds
[10:21:42] <dood4> todd_work - thanks a bunch that would be awesome
[10:22:22] <todd_work> dood4:  this one? http://jquery.malsup.com/gfeed/
[10:22:57] <dood4> todd_work - yeah that's the one I'm using - I have already extended the jquery plugin a bit, but not with a full "combine feeds" functionality
[10:27:42] <kelly1212> whyyy wont it work without a comma???
[10:32:48] <asdf_> kelly1212, isn't the problem that the elements are span (not block level) and initially set to hidden which conflicts w/ the slideToggle ? o_O
[10:36:30] <saba> I've got a table with 10 rows and 10 columns in each row and I need to add class 'foo' to each of the 5 last columns of each row. Now, I'm doing this like $('table tr').each(function(){ $('td', this).slice(5).addClass('foo');  });
[10:36:41] <hashpuppy> i have an on click event on this li element, where <li><a href="#">click</a></li>.  problem is that it seems to actually go to # and thus jump to the top of the page when someone clicks it.  i've added e.stopPropagation() and e.preventDefault();, but I still get this behavior.  any ideas?
[10:36:53] <oudee> anybody knows how getjson works?
[10:37:00] <saba> how can I optimize this further? Like selecting 'table tr td' and using slice () on that directly, requireing two dimensions?
[10:37:15] <saba> oudee: what about it?
[10:37:20] <oudee> especially the last example on api.jquery.com page?
[10:37:38] <oudee> i don't understund these parameters in it
[10:37:52] <saba> hashpuppy: use href="javascript:;" instead
[10:38:09] <todd_work> dood4:  http://jsfiddle.net/WSuU8/2/
[10:38:10] <saba> or even javascript:void(0);
[10:38:13] <asdf_> hashpuppy: what does the handler look like?
[10:38:14] <oudee> an example of this test.js file it refers would be good
[10:38:29] <todd_work> i can't see what feedcontrol is returning but if it's a JSON object, you can see where i was headed.
[10:38:39] <hashpuppy> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/526995/
[10:38:45] <todd_work> dood4:  oops. 1 sec
[10:38:53] <dood4> todd_work -> yeah the google doc is so shitty can't find the feedcontrol either
[10:39:15] <dood4> todd_work -> and thank you, that's really nice of you :)
[10:39:31] <todd_work> dood4:  try revision 3. in any case. you should be able to build an array before returning this.
[10:40:32] <dood4> todd_work -> yeha I must be able to get it in JSon
[10:40:58] <oudee> is it first fetching json data from server and then adds into that those name:"john", time:"2pm" or how it works?
[10:41:42] <kelly1212> ok so the problem is that i have code that is loaded within my model, (Rails) and it doesnt show up on page source but it does show up when i inspect element, is there a way to tell jquery to look for the element anyways?
[10:41:45] <oudee> i think who ever wrote that example should have put up that test.js file too
[10:42:47] <oudee> ..anyway it says after it that this channel offers help if i have any questions about it :)
[10:43:02] <yan_nick> hey guys, what is the best way to save the content of a contenteditable div?
[10:43:57] <asdf_> hashpuppy: maybe the function is returning before reaching preventDefault ?
[10:44:08] <oudee> perhaps it filters out the data but i don't know, anybody know this?
[10:45:44] <BrotherRodriguez> Hey everybody. I'm trying to return a JSON file from my server for use in a some charts/tables (handled by google visualization). Some of the elements in the file are javascript Date Obj. I want to pass these as date objects instead of strings because of how they're handled by the google API. However, "eval is evil" and when I try to parse with $.parseJSON or $.ajax({dataType: 'json' ... });
[10:45:44] <BrotherRodriguez> I get a parse error. Any hints? This jsfiddle illustrates the problem in extremeley simplified terms: http://jsfiddle.net/beej/MVhSV/
[10:46:14] <BrotherRodriguez> basically, is there a "jquery eval" that is safer
[10:46:31] <BrotherRodriguez> that is bound to ajax
[10:46:53] <oudee> somebody else is asking the same thing on comment section but unfortunatly there isn't an answer
[10:52:12] <hlveheart> Eyo dudes. what's the best way to trigger a sound at a javascript event?
[10:52:41] <dollz> any new /cool techniques to show/fetch contents on 1 page [homepage] ?
[10:52:48] <dollz> like mediafire.com
[10:53:19] <hlveheart> Assuming using something like whileloading()?
[10:55:24] <kelly1212> hey guys, I'm having a little issue with the following jQuery and Rails code
[10:55:25] <kelly1212> https://gist.github.com/1529169
[10:59:14] <RLa> kelly1212, so what is the issue?
[10:59:19] <hlveheart> ^^ what's the best way to trigger a sound at a javascript event? currently I have a div to the dom with a youtube set to autoplay ... but it's super laggy.
[10:59:50] <RLa> "something screws up" is not very specific
[11:00:25] <kelly1212> the issue is that the jQuery only recognizes the list as a whole (#markers_list) but none of the li (.clickme) elements
[11:00:41] <kelly1212> im pretty sure the reason is because the html is not showing in the page source
[11:00:49] <RLa> kelly1212, i think you might want $.on
[11:00:54] <kelly1212> because when i hard code the list into the page using the same jquery
[11:00:56] <kelly1212> it work
[11:01:02] <kelly1212> $.on?
[11:01:15] <RLa> because handlers do not end up on elements added later than handlers
[11:01:40] <kelly1212> where would i add that to the jquery?
[11:02:40] <RLa> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:02:49] <RLa> read the manual, it's not so trivial
[11:03:29] <h0st1le> what do i have to do to make my jquery ajax request return as a static file that is downloaded and not a jquery object?
[11:03:34] <RLa> also see that it works since 1.7, make sure you do not have older version
[11:03:46] <RLa> on older versions there was .live()
[11:04:26] <kelly1212> still not working
[11:05:10] <kelly1212> same effect
[11:05:50] <wycks> can jquery do path animations somewhat easily or should I use something else ( for example animate an object along a path like so, http://draw.to/D3ZeoHW )
[11:07:11] <Chetic> how can I put my own form submit function after the one that's already applied?
[11:08:15] <Chetic> using a validation library, which relies on the submit function returning false to not submit if it is not valid
[11:08:28] <h0st1le> can someone tell me what im doing wrong here? The response i want to return as a static file that is downloaded to the user. but the following code returns the response as a jquery object not a download. Any help?
[11:08:29] <h0st1le> http://pastebin.com/R4w0r5iA
[11:08:43] <sphinxxx> wycks, try using sencha animator
[11:10:06] <wycks> sphinxxx wow ty no idea such a tool existed
[11:10:53] <robin_sz> djQuery, whats cloud9?
[11:11:25] <wycks> robin_sz cloud9 is an online ide
[11:12:04] <robin_sz> does it do drag-and-drop jquery UI components?
[11:12:52] <asdf_> kelly1212, maybe the DOM is not ready: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[11:12:58] <wycks> it supports github and bitbucket typically your store your code there
[11:13:09] <wycks> suports some other stuff I forget
[11:14:30] <robin_sz> uh huh ... I dont really care where it stores it, so long as it does drag-and-drop Jquery UI components
[11:14:59] <ajpiano> what do you mean by "darg and drop jQuery UI Components"
[11:15:12] <wycks> ya no idea what that means
[11:15:28] <ajpiano> a webapp that lets you design a frontend from jquery ui widgets by dragging and dropping them into place?
[11:15:31] <ajpiano> no such thing exists
[11:15:37] <ajpiano> afaik
[11:15:58] <robin_sz> wonder why djQuery recommended cloud9 then? oh well.
[11:17:04] <kelly1212> how would i convert this jquery to coffescript?
[11:17:05] <kelly1212> https://gist.github.com/1529169
[11:17:09] <wycks> actually one does exist but it's not recommended for actual production, more prototyping
[11:17:55] <djQuery> robin_sz: wycks: actualy u can run it from your own machine as well. It runs on top of node.js
[11:18:37] <robin_sz> djQuery, whatever, it does not seem to have the drag and drop of jquery UI components
[11:19:07] <Eviltwin> kelly1212: Why would you want to?
[11:19:08] <djQuery> robin_sz: what are u wanting to drag and drop?
[11:19:09] <djQuery> https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9
[11:19:10] <robin_sz> seems like a sort of online version of eclipse, but slower and you have to pay for it?
[11:19:43] <djQuery> robin_sz: opensource doesnt have to pay for the online version and like I said you can run it from your machine
[11:19:49] <kelly1212> hallefuckinlujag
[11:19:50] <wycks> basically, but it works with the cloud so it will/is more integrated
[11:19:52] <kelly1212> basbdhsada
[11:20:08] <robin_sz> euuuuw. nasty
[11:20:17] <Eviltwin> kelly1212: Put ``'s around it and boom, it's CoffeeScript :P
[11:20:25] <kelly1212> lol
[11:20:39] <kelly1212> put ' 's and delete )};
[11:21:08] <robin_sz> djQuery, yeah, I'll pass. it doesnt do what I need and I dont write opensource code either.
[11:21:26] <ch3mical> Boo! Hiss!
[11:21:30] <Eviltwin> I've never written CoffeeScript before but I think it's something like this: http://pastebin.com/MPReUfb4
[11:21:45] <ajpiano> wycks: what's the link to that tool, we should really send robin_sz on their way and be done with this insipid subject
[11:22:11] <wycks> ajpiano it's called ixedit
[11:22:24] <robin_sz> I shall have a look :)
[11:23:18] <robin_sz> woah, cloud9 does have one really nice feature I wish more sites had
[11:23:30] <robin_sz> that is truly nice.
[11:23:56] <robin_sz> a one click "delete your account and sign out" button ... awesome.
[11:24:21] <ch3mical> What if I want to delete my account and stay signed in? o_o
[11:26:12] <robin_sz> hold the alt key
[11:27:08] <robin_sz> or if on a mac, ctr-shift-altgr, option esc 7
[11:31:53] <robin_sz> I guess you can;t beat hand-coded html and javascript
[11:35:30] <Chetic> how do I make a button click act the same as beforeunload?
[11:36:16] <kelly1212> hey guys how would i change the following code so that when a li element is clicked the hidden div appears but on the other li elements that mightve been active the li disappears
[11:36:17] <kelly1212> https://gist.github.com/1529323
[11:36:53] <sphinxxx> anyone know much about Gifsicle (gif compression tool)
[11:37:02] <djQuery> function myBeforeUnlod(){}    $(document).unload(myBeforeUnload); $('.mybutton').click(myBeforeUnload);
[11:37:16] <djQuery> Chetic: ^^^^^^
[11:37:34] <ravenzz> kelly1212 you don't need those presentational classes
[11:37:47] <basalt79> hi all, i have a 5 links with the same class and i want to add an click function which returns false, but if the first was clicked, and false was returned, the others will not be notified ?!?
[11:37:53] <kelly1212> huh?
[11:38:35] <Eviltwin> kelly1212: Run that by me one more time
[11:38:58] <kelly1212> hey eviltwin! finally solved that problem you were helping me with yesterday
[11:39:52] <kelly1212> now, i was wondering what you'd have to add to the jQuery so that only one hidden element appears at a time, basically, you click on an li and the hidden div appears but the hidden div disappears on the previously active li
[11:39:55] <kelly1212> https://gist.github.com/1529323
[11:39:58] <djQuery> $(this).siblings().find('.expanded').slideUp().removeClass('expanded');
[11:40:07] <djQuery> kelly1212: ^^^^
[11:40:14] <Chetic> djQuery: my beforeunload function is just return "blabla lose data"; and that wouldn't work if I made a button click run it
[11:40:18] <Eviltwin> Or simply: http://jsfiddle.net/kyXcL/2/
[11:40:46] <basalt79> hi all, i have a 5 links with the same class and i want to add an click function which returns false, but if the first was clicked, and false was returned, the others will not be notified ?!?
[11:40:47] <tgodar> im adding a .dblclick() event handler on a table but on document ready the table is not instantiated yet. I added it instead to a callback. There any issue with adding the dblclick handler over and over that way? Does it go on a stack or just over write the one that was there?
[11:41:43] <Eviltwin> tgodar: You can attach as many event listeners as your heart desires
[11:41:47] <Eviltwin> They get added to a list
[11:41:51] <Eviltwin> In the order you added them
[11:42:04] <basalt79> if i use the click function return false, all other a will not be called in jquery
[11:42:10] <jaequery> if i have a date object, how can i convert this into 2011-12-25 11:00:00 format?
[11:42:21] <Eviltwin> basalt79: What?
[11:42:32] <djQuery> Chetic: well thats not what you asked
[11:43:09] <ravenzz> kelly1212 what are you trying to do? it doesn't make sense
[11:43:09] <kelly1212> genius
[11:43:17] <kelly1212> eviltiwn thank you once again
[11:43:25] <solidus-lake> hey guys, how do you get script retrieved and ran from the server via an ajax request to raise errors on the javascript console
[11:43:27] <kelly1212> djquery thank you as well
[11:43:34] <solidus-lake> right now my server side script just silently fails
[11:43:37] <basalt79> Eviltwin: 5 links with the same class, all get the click function, link 1 was clicked, function was called, function returned false, link 2 was clicked, function was not called
[11:43:43] <ravenzz> If i understood correctly you want to show the clicked one and hide any other .hidden ?
[11:43:44] <solidus-lake> by server side i mean retrieved from a string response to an ajax call
[11:43:59] <Eviltwin> basalt79: Try clicking link 2 first and see what happens
[11:44:17] <tgodar> Eviltwin: so if this is just the same one getting added over and over on each pass thru callback... seems wrong.  A way to clear them?  or is this ok?
[11:44:25] <Eviltwin> solidus-lake: It should do that automatically
[11:44:55] <Eviltwin> tgodar: Use the delegate-style event listener
[11:45:59] <basalt79> Eviltwin: sorry seems to be a id and class missmatch, sorry, thx
[11:46:08] <tgodar> Eviltwin..."now or in the future"... thats the aspect I was looking for - thanks!
[11:46:31] <robin_sz> solidus-lake, pack your error up as a string, or hatver, return it as the "error" field in a json-encoded result
[11:46:49] <robin_sz> then "do something" with it on your browser
[11:49:52] <melii> hi, i have a problem by sending a post with ajax, if i send the formdata at the first time all will work perfect, if i send it a second time the data is still the same like first time and cant be change
[11:49:56] <melii> http://jsfiddle.net/GLm9B/
[11:51:31] <Eviltwin> melii: Don't use .live
[11:52:05] <alessioalex> How come I get an array of 1 element when doing $('#my_id') instead of just the element directly?
[11:52:17] <Eviltwin> You also have doubly nested document ready's plus its actually inside an onLoad for the jsFiddle
[11:52:41] <Eviltwin> alessioalex: Because elements don't have things like .slideToggle()
[11:53:05] <alessioalex> ?
[11:53:05] <Eviltwin> It's also part of the magic of jQuery
[11:53:15] <Eviltwin> $("...").click(function(){...})
[11:53:22] <Eviltwin> It doesn't matter how many elements the selector matched
[11:53:30] <alessioalex> oh
[11:53:34] <Eviltwin> That code's going to bind to all of them
[11:53:38] <alessioalex> ok maybe I just had the wrong impression
[11:53:43] <Eviltwin> Even if it didn't match anything or only matched one thing
[11:53:46] <alessioalex> thanks
[11:54:11] <Eviltwin> Because it's basically always working on arrays of elements
[11:54:12] <melii> thanks eviltwin
[11:57:24] <melii> http://jsfiddle.net/xxbJx/ whats wrong now? i change live to click
[11:57:36] <melii> the content don´t open in the dialog
[11:57:46] <melii> its open a new site
[11:58:14] <Eviltwin> ?demo
[11:58:14] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[11:58:44] <melii> http://jsfiddle.net/xxbJx/
[12:00:00] <iateadonut> when you use $.each(... is there some variable that keeps track of how many iterations have gone through?
[12:01:01] <sphinxxx> iatedonut, yes, 'index' or 'i' in the function
[12:01:23] <sphinxxx> .each(function(i) {
[12:02:20] <melii> with the livefunction the content open in the dialog but with click it dont, crazy
[12:04:19] <someprimetime> is it better to change the value of an attribute like attr('disabled', false) or remove the attribute altogether like removeAttr('disabled')?
[12:04:35] <iateadonut> sphinxxx thanks.
[12:06:17] <erichynds> someprimetime: neither - use prop("disabled", false)
[12:10:41] <someprimetime> erichynds: i'm getting a uncaught error on that for some reason: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'prop'
[12:11:10] <erichynds> what version of jquery?
[12:11:30] <someprimetime> 1.5.2
[12:11:32] <someprimetime> ah that's why
[12:11:35] <someprimetime> it's only 1.6 and up
[12:11:39] <erichynds> use attr("disabled") then
[12:11:44] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[12:11:47] <Eviltwin> Yeah, it's right there
[12:14:11] <imanc> hey can anyone explain how this works?  function loadPlugins(el){     $('.share_popup', el).each(function(){
[12:14:19] <someprimetime> erichynds: since we're staying with 1.5 for now, would removeAttr() be appropriate when using attr('disabled')?
[12:14:38] <wycks> sphinxxx I ended up with a framework called jsanim instead of that sencha thing (tried it and its a bit complex to learn quickly)
[12:14:39] <erichynds> i'm not sure if removeAttr also toggles the property, but attr() definitely does in 1.5
[12:14:39] <imanc> The site is using html5 boilerplate, and I need to add some new jquery, but don't know how loadplugins works, so I'm unsure how to add the new code
[12:14:51] <someprimetime> ok, i'll look into it more thanks
[12:15:01] <erichynds> it probably does
[12:15:03] <erichynds> try it and see..
[12:15:06] <Eviltwin> imanc: What don't you understand?
[12:15:07] <someprimetime> doing that now :)
[12:15:49] <imanc> specifically what loadPlugin(el) is doing
[12:15:52] <wathek> Hi everyone
[12:16:10] <Eviltwin> I don't believe jQuery has a loadPlugin method
[12:16:25] <Eviltwin> Perhaps you need to start here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[12:16:39] <melii> how can i check if my response contains the string errors?
[12:16:47] <wathek> is it possible to put the name of the element in a var and then try to get the elem whose name is in that var ? something like this : var elem = '#mydiv'; $(elem).slideUp();
[12:17:39] <Eviltwin> wathek: $("input[name=foobar]") is how you select inputs with name "foobar"
[12:17:53] <melii> something like $(response).contains('errors')
[12:18:12] <Eviltwin> melii: Is response text?
[12:18:14] <wathek> Eviltwin, that has nothing to do with my question
[12:18:28] <melii> yes
[12:18:39] <Eviltwin> wathek: That will select the element with id "mydiv"
[12:18:42] <Eviltwin> If that's what you're looking to do
[12:18:48] <wathek> yes
[12:18:58] <wathek> select the element with id "mydiv"
[12:18:59] <Eviltwin> melii: Look at JavaScript's indexOf
[12:19:01] <Eviltwin> For a string
[12:19:09] <wathek> however "mydiv" is stored in a var
[12:19:18] <Eviltwin> $("#"+myvar).slideUp()
[12:19:22] <wathek> ah
[12:19:25] <wathek> ok thankyou
[12:19:39] <Eviltwin> I assumed you had the other half
[12:19:43] <Engin> wtf! getJSON on foo.com/bar?q=x&a=b works, foo.com/bar/x?a=b is cancelled by browser (chrome) for being cross domain
[12:19:48] <Eviltwin> And you were asking how to select something by name instead of ID
[12:20:12] <Eviltwin> Engin: Where is the page right now?
[12:25:05] <Engin> Eviltwin: localhost :)
[12:25:14] <melii> how can i check if my response contains the string errors?
[12:25:17] <Eviltwin> Engin: That causes problems
[12:27:56] <Engin> well, i can't explain how does the URL makes the differnce
[12:28:16] <melii> my response is htmldata
[12:28:59] <someprimetime> http://jsbin.com/isaliq/edit#javascript,html so both of those work
[12:29:09] <someprimetime> removing the attribute and setting the attribute value
[12:29:12] <Woet> Engin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3849200/localhost-cross-domain-ajax
[12:29:16] <someprimetime> performance wise, what makes more sense?
[12:29:23] <someprimetime> removing a dom element or just changing an existing one?
[12:29:39] <Woet> Engin: localhost is even stricter than the internet because it has local file access
[12:30:18] <Engin> Woet: read my question again please
[12:30:21] <Eviltwin> melii: http://jsfiddle.net/G6dbw/
[12:30:37] <Woet> Engin: i've read it. you cannot access different folders on localhost
[12:30:43] <Woet> Engin: hence /bar/ won't work.
[12:30:51] <Eviltwin> It varies from browser to browser
[12:31:08] <Eviltwin> Some browsers let you access anything via file:// if you're file://
[12:31:11] <melii> oh very nice..thank u eviltwin
[12:31:18] <Eviltwin> Others only let you access yourself
[12:31:27] <Eviltwin> Others only let you access subdirs
[12:32:22] <Chetic> is it possible to submit an event to be fired after all submits are finished?
[12:32:35] <Eviltwin> "submit"?
[12:32:47] <melii> but i only need true or false if it would found
[12:33:33] <Eviltwin> Then let me be more specific: http://jsfiddle.net/G6dbw/1/
[12:33:45] <Eviltwin> I hope you can figure out how if statements work
[12:34:43] <Engin> Woet: http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=X&alt=json works http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/X?alt=json does NOT work
[12:34:48] <Engin> Woet: does that explain it ?
[12:35:08] <Woet> maybe because the last URL says "Invalid id" ?
[12:35:09] <Woet> or what?
[12:35:39] <Woet> i'm not sure what your question is, Engin, but as mentioned, crossdomains work completely different on localhost
[12:37:09] <Chetic> is it possible to add an event to be fired after submits are finished?
[12:37:10] <Engin> my question is simple, what is the different between those two URLs that makes one work and the other not
[12:37:25] <Woet> [21:35:08] <Woet> maybe because the last URL says "Invalid id" ?
[12:37:32] <Engin> they are quite similar in function too
[12:37:49] <Engin> what does it mean ?
[12:37:51] <melii> eviltwin i know but i get hundred of falses
[12:38:36] <Eviltwin> Chetic: Rephrase the question
[12:39:26] <Eviltwin> Engin: .getJSON attempts to parse the data it receives as JSON
[12:39:36] <Chetic> gosh darnit
[12:39:39] <Eviltwin> Engin: The first one returns valid JSON and the second does not
[12:39:49] <Eviltwin> Therefore the second is considered a failure
[12:40:17] <Chetic> does $("form").submit(funcname); replace whatever function had been put in there before it?
[12:40:17] <BinaryMaster> Question: I am trying to write a basic form validation plugin to jQuery but when I try to loop through the form elements the id's become undefined code is here [http://pastebin.com/uWBhD8mE] thank you for any help!
[12:40:29] <Eviltwin> Chetic: No
[12:41:13] <Chetic> Eviltwin: so does it place the new function last in a queue?
[12:41:20] <Eviltwin> BinaryMaster: Where? What line?
[12:41:26] <Engin> Eviltwin: no, chrome simply throws exception and cancels request
[12:41:27] <Eviltwin> Chetic: Last in the list, yes
[12:41:31] <Engin> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/2-8n6rTH6Ns&alt=json. Origin http://192.168.1.107 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[12:42:03] <BinaryMaster> Eviltwin, from what I can tell with my alerts when it hits line 143
[12:42:20] <Eviltwin> Engin: Can you throw this in a jsFiddle?
[12:42:44] <Chetic> Eviltwin: is there a way to stop that list from being executed? return false doesn't seem to be working
[12:42:46] <BinaryMaster> I think my problem is in the line 140 that says $(this).children().each(function(){
[12:43:12] <Eviltwin> Inside that function, "this" refers to the particular child, not the form any more
[12:44:03] <BinaryMaster> right which is what I expect but when I alert $(this).attr('id') its undefined
[12:44:36] <Eviltwin> Okay
[12:44:42] <Eviltwin> You know elements don't have to have IDs, right?
[12:44:45] <BinaryMaster> and I know the form field has id
[12:44:49] <BinaryMaster> yes
[12:44:56] <Eviltwin> First, see ?alert
[12:44:57] <bot-t> First, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[12:45:32] <Eviltwin> I'll also give you a heads up right now
[12:45:44] <Eviltwin> 90% of forms don't have the inputs immediately inside the <form> tag
[12:45:44] <BinaryMaster> okay
[12:45:53] <Eviltwin> They're nested in a layout inside the form
[12:45:58] <Eviltwin> So .children() will not be sufficient
[12:46:13] <Eviltwin> I suggest you use a .find() and search for inputs, buttons, etc
[12:46:25] <BinaryMaster> okay
[12:46:46] <BinaryMaster> that makes a lot of sense
[12:46:52] <BinaryMaster> thank you
[12:46:58] <BinaryMaster> I will try that out
[12:47:21] <Eviltwin> I used .find("input,select,textarea,button")
[12:47:24] <Eviltwin> Not sure if that covers everything
[12:47:41] <BinaryMaster> Thank you
[12:48:05] <Eviltwin> You can probably drop "button" for your purposes
[12:48:08] <BinaryMaster> I would then add my .each( to the end of that
[12:48:10] <Eviltwin> As the user's not changing the butotn's value
[12:48:14] <Eviltwin> Correct
[12:48:26] <BinaryMaster> thank you
[12:52:21] <BinaryMaster> Eviltwin, Thank you very much that fixed it!
[12:52:25] <iateadonut> i've got a script that does something like:    var plot = $.plot(..., and after i call this, i can find some information this way: alert ( plot.getData()[0].color );  - the problem is, i need to use that information to create the original variable.
[12:54:34] <Eviltwin> Good luck then
[12:55:33] <iateadonut> Eviltwin, thanks.
[13:01:53] <tfitts> is there a jquery method for preloading images with any advantage over plain javascript?
[13:04:20] <Eviltwin> tfitts: Uh...
[13:04:23] <Eviltwin> jQuery is JavaScript
[13:04:28] <tfitts> I know
[13:04:39] <tfitts> it's a library
[13:04:45] <Eviltwin> So whatever jQuery's doing could be done in just JavaScript
[13:04:46] <tfitts> with some things having overhead
[13:04:51] <tfitts> right
[13:05:07] <tfitts> ok, thanks
[13:06:01] <Eviltwin> There's no way to get a performance gain by using jQuery
[13:06:13] <Eviltwin> But it will probably save you a lot of headaches of your own
[13:06:24] <Eviltwin> With generally little overheard (aside from loading the whole thing in the first place)
[13:06:58] <Krinkle> Eviltwin: Not entirely true. Chances are that more advanced traversals are done more efficiently in jQuery than most people would do by hand
[13:07:04] <Krinkle> since it's the mind of the community together
[13:07:19] <Krinkle> surely simple things like .prop() or .each() will go faster in plain javascript.
[13:07:53] <tfitts> excellent, I was hoping to start a debate on the efficiencies of jQuery with my question... ;)
[13:08:01] <Krinkle> and strictly speaking everything is faster if you just write function-less pure javascript that does exactly what you need right away.
[13:08:11] <iateadonut> can i change a javascript object into a jquery object?
[13:08:23] <snover> sigh.
[13:08:27] <Krinkle> but jQuery vs. non-jQuery isn't realistic. I'd say jQuery vs. average javascript being written, jQuery is likely faster.
[13:08:28] <snover> iateadonut: that question makes no sense.
[13:10:09] <Eviltwin> Krinkle: There's still no way jQuery can outperform well-written JavaScript for the job
[13:10:15] <Eviltwin> And that was my point
[13:10:39] <Eviltwin> jQuery makes it a lot easier to do things well
[13:10:50] <Krinkle> Eviltwin: Depends, one could argue jQuery is well-written JavaScript. What are the requirements ? Fast in Chrome ? Or compatible with IE6 ?
[13:10:53] <Eviltwin> But at the cost of some extra function calls and abstraction overhead
[13:10:54] <Krinkle> or both at the same time ?
[13:11:42] <Krinkle> If you'd write your own addClass, live() etc. what would it eventually be
[13:11:49] <iateadonut> jquery can be applied on variables as javascript objects, then?
[13:12:05] <Eviltwin> The real benefit of jQuery is is that it forces at least some organization
[13:12:27] <iateadonut> nevermind.
[13:12:27] <Eviltwin> And the methods are optimized as much as they can be without losing their abstraction
[13:14:31] <PW-toXic__> hi, how can i check if two elements are the same?
[13:14:48] <PW-toXic__> or lets say, if two variables hold the same element as a jquery object
[13:15:10] <Eviltwin> PW-toXic__: Is it one element each?
[13:15:13] <Eviltwin> Or not always?
[13:15:22] <iateadonut> how do i select the third element with class '.class1'?
[13:15:38] <PW-toXic__> Eviltwin, it should be one element each
[13:16:22] <PW-toXic__> Eviltwin, both variables are the result of an each(function() { $(this)});
[13:17:02] <iateadonut> actually, the nth element
[13:17:03] <PW-toXic__> Eviltwin, i need this function in order to hide all ul lists but the one that is already selected
[13:17:39] <rknLA> does anyone know if it's possible to put a file upload into a nested json object as .ajax data?
[13:17:47] <rknLA> (and/or how to do it)
[13:18:34] <Eviltwin> PW-toXic__: $("#id")[0] === this is one way for one element
[13:19:09] <PW-toXic__> Eviltwin, works, thanks
[13:19:25] <Eviltwin> You can also do something like $(".all").css("display","none"); $("#foo").css("display","block") without any sort of visible flash
[13:20:02] <rknLA> so that the server gets something like this: https://gist.github.com/1529793
[13:30:49] <kompost> somebody out there to help me with a jquery problem?
[13:30:58] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ kompost
[13:30:58] <bot-t> kompost, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:33:32] <kompost> i have got an hashchange event in my code. in a certain function i set a flag to false, to not execute the events function. i modify the hash then. when the function finished, the flag is set to true. but then the hashchange event occurs, that i prohibited before. help?
[13:34:40] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ kompost
[13:34:40] <bot-t> kompost, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[13:36:41] <melii> eviltwin i tested something and u were right that the live()-method was the problem but i load the content which contains the class iframe via ajax, -->look here pls http://jsfiddle.net/P5tR4/
[13:40:48] <rknLA> updated gist with more code: https://gist.github.com/1529793 re: nesting json with file uploads
[13:41:30] <Eviltwin> rknLA: What was the issue?
[13:42:22] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ kompost
[13:42:22] <bot-t> kompost, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[13:42:49] <rknLA> Eviltwin: augh.. gist and its alphabetizing.. so, i'm getting the actual params by using the form and js posted, but i need a way to get the ideal params listed at the bottom (i.e. to nest the file upload into a JSON object that gets POSTed)
[13:43:28] <rknLA> actually.. now that i look at it, i'm not even sure if that js is getting called.
[13:44:19] <Eviltwin> I don't understand this stuff with the #'s
[13:44:37] <Eviltwin> Forms don't send that way
[13:44:57] <rknLA> ah, that's how ruby on rails sees the file on the server side
[13:45:05] <Eviltwin> So that's RoR's parsing of it
[13:45:11] <rknLA> yeah
[13:45:12] <Eviltwin> Makes it difficult to connect the two
[13:45:38] <Eviltwin> I'm going to guess that the ideal isn't possible, unfortunately
[13:46:44] <rknLA> well, it's certainly possible to do.  i'm actually getting that server-side in my test cases, but those use ruby on rails, rather than a browser
[13:47:01] <rknLA> it's just a matter of making the browser do it
[13:47:19] <Eviltwin> I'm saying I'm not sure it's possible to make the browser send it the way you want
[13:47:44] <rknLA> ah
[13:56:27] <rknLA> hmm..
[13:56:43] <rknLA> i think i might be able to use the input field's .files attr
[13:56:52] <rknLA> (this is more pure js than jquery now though.. heh)
[14:01:11] <melii> eviltwin?
[14:02:24] <xrated> Ask for the good one
[14:02:27] <xrated> he might be here
[14:03:28] <rknLA> =P
[14:03:49] <jrm2k6> hi all; why here : http://jsfiddle.net/jrm2k6/zDZ8s/ if i put a return 'something' in the function of FB.api('/me', function(response){..} the returned variable is always undefined
[14:04:16] <Eviltwin> jrm2k6: It's because you're failing to understand asynchronous programming
[14:04:23] <iYuri> hi guys
[14:05:03] <jrm2k6> Eviltwin, ok, that's clear but..how could i be less ignorante, I've searched about it but found nothing relevant
[14:05:08] <jrm2k6> ignorant*
[14:05:23] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to return to?
[14:06:06] <jrm2k6> it was just to test, let's say I want to return a string with value 'blabla'
[14:06:10] <Eviltwin> This is an example of a synchronous function and an asyncronous function: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/
[14:06:14] <Eviltwin> And how they work differently
[14:06:15] <jrm2k6> ok thank you, I check
[14:06:32] <Eviltwin> A synchronous function returns the interesting information
[14:06:48] <Eviltwin> An asyncronous function calls a callback function you specify with the interesting information
[14:07:12] <Eviltwin> This version is labeled with letters that represent the order things actually run in: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/1/
[14:07:37] <Eviltwin> A being the first line to run and R being the last
[14:07:41] <jrm2k6> ok
[14:07:51] <melii> why u ignore me? sry, if i went on your nerves
[14:08:41] <Eviltwin> melii: You you sent wasn't a working example
[14:08:46] <jrm2k6> wow thanks Eviltwin I begin to get it
[14:08:48] <Eviltwin> I clicked links and it sent me to a 404
[14:08:55] <iYuri> Hope somebody could help me: I have a menu that loads a list -> each item of that list loads a image gallery
[14:09:04] <Eviltwin> jrm2k6: Good, I'm just about to leave so I can't explain too much more unfortunately
[14:09:10] <iYuri> I would display the slideshow with this script
[14:09:10] <iYuri> http://pastebin.com/xYSChZYy
[14:09:33] <jrm2k6> I will try to figure it out by myself :) thanks for the indication :)
[14:09:34] <iYuri> http://fancybox.net/
[14:09:40] <BrotherRodriguez> Eviltwin, thanks for that jsfiddle on asynchonous programming. I'm saving that as an example.
[14:09:52] <danzik17> Eviltwin: just curious - assuming you use one, what's your preferred templating engine?  ( evaluating a bunch for use at the moment )
[14:09:58] <Eviltwin> BrotherRodriguez: Yeah, I had that on hand
[14:10:02] <rknLA> what happens when you pass an anonymous function into jquery? like in this example: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin
[14:10:05] <iYuri> the problem is: if I put the short code in the same page of the gallery: it seems like it loops
[14:10:06] <Eviltwin> danzik17: For HTML templating?
[14:10:10] <danzik17> yep
[14:10:17] <Eviltwin> I ended up hacking my own thing together that's not really finished
[14:10:40] <iYuri> if I put it in the index <script> tag
[14:10:43] <danzik17> ah k, fair enough
[14:10:44] <BrotherRodriguez> Eviltwin, do you have other's like that posted? Similarly basic tutorial fiddles? I'm coming from a PHP background and am having trouble quickly switching to the idea of asynchonous programming.
[14:10:51] <iYuri> it doesn't work
[14:11:00] <iYuri> what should I have to use?
[14:11:04] <iYuri> maybe .bind?
[14:11:26] <Eviltwin> iYuri: $(document).ready(function(){...})?
[14:11:51] <kensanata> I have a HTML string (starting with a DOCTYPE declaration) in local storage and want to replace the current page with this string. How would I do this: $("html").html(window.localStorage.getItem(id)) seems to work but I wonder...
[14:12:14] <kensanata> After all, what happens to the headers element?
[14:12:49] <snover> kensanata: that is wrong and terrible
[14:12:54] <Eviltwin> BrotherRodriguez: Here are a couple of things from my jsFiddle collection that might possibly be helpful: http://pastebin.com/XsCRJj9E
[14:13:03] <BrotherRodriguez> Gracias.
[14:13:04] <rknLA> in that example, is that just shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {…})?
[14:13:06] <kensanata> snover: I suspected as much. :) What should I do insteaad?
[14:13:19] <iYuri> Eviltwin: I already have an $(document).ready(functio
[14:13:21] <snover> kensanata: don’t try to do what you are doing
[14:13:22] <iYuri> I load all my elements with that
[14:13:27] <Eviltwin> 5/6 are an example of why you shouldn't use "async: false"
[14:13:30] <iYuri> using .click() or .delegate() if the element is in a lower page
[14:13:47] <Eviltwin> For AJAX
[14:13:53] <Eviltwin> 6 being what happens when you use it
[14:14:31] <Eviltwin> BrotherRodriguez: These are all things I've had people ask about more than once in here
[14:14:34] <snover> kensanata: what exactly is it you are trying to do anywaY?
[14:14:34] <Eviltwin> So I kept a copy handy
[14:14:40] <melii> i cant give u a working example with jsfiddler because i load external files with jQuery.load(), in this external files are links who contains class=iframe int the tag-><a class="iframe" href="link1.html"> and now i try to grab the iframe to get a dialog with $('.iframe).live({shows me the dialog}), $('.iframe).click({can´t show me the dialog because there is no data with class="iframe"})
[14:14:41] <kensanata> snover: I'm storing a bunch of pages in local storage in order to build an offline app.
[14:14:43] <BrotherRodriguez> For sure.
[14:14:55] <snover> kensanata: you’re doing it wrong. you don’t build pages for offline apps.
[14:15:06] <snover> not like that anyway.
[14:15:24] <Eviltwin> Well, at least you shouldn't do it that way
[14:15:53] <iYuri> would it be possible something like this?
[14:15:53] <iYuri> http://pastebin.com/nENnj0Hf
[14:16:05] <snover> kensanata: go look at mulberry or something
[14:16:16] <kensanata> snover: ok...
[14:17:08] <kensanata> snover: Do you have an URL? The first bunch of Google results seem very off topic.
[14:17:39] <snover> http://mulberry.toura.com/
[14:17:53] <kensanata> snover: Thanks.
[14:19:32] <Yurii> Eviltwin
[14:19:34] <Yurii> would it be possible something like this?
[14:19:36] <Yurii> http://pastebin.com/nENnj0Hf
[14:20:01] <Eviltwin> Maybe? I don't use fancybox
[14:20:26] <Yurii> this is the original call like
[14:20:26] <Yurii> http://pastebin.com/xYSChZYy
[14:20:41] <Yurii> I would like to find something similar to .delegate
[14:20:50] <kensanata> snover: It would seem to me that this won't work on my laptop -- this is a PhoneGap replacement or something similar. Is there something I am missing? Sure, I might be using it on my iPad, but I'd be nice if the resulting web app were a truly stand-alone HTML5 thing that also works on my Xubuntu laptop...
[14:21:02] <Eviltwin> Then probably not
[14:21:16] <Yurii> i thought to .bind(), but .fancybox() must be attached directly to the a tag
[14:21:23] <snover> kensanata: I didn’t say you should use it, I just said you should look at how it works because it does it the Right Way
[14:21:53] <Eviltwin> .delegate is used to replace a call to .bind
[14:22:09] <Eviltwin> (Or .click/.mouseover etc)
[14:22:17] <Eviltwin> In their listener forms
[14:33:08] <progrock`> I'm using jquery ui's resizeable with a custom resize function.  I'm using the second argument, "ui" to calc heights (its resizing height only by dragging the top)... chrome works eprfect.. FF it visually appears wrong
[14:33:39] <progrock`> any insight would be great,.. I'm sure someone has ran into this inconsistancy
[14:40:12] <progrock`> wow, don tknow if I''ve seen this channel so dead
[14:40:19] <progrock`> does jquery ui have its own channel?
[14:40:43] <someprimetime> this channel isn't dead
[14:40:50] <someprimetime> there has been plenty of activity today
[14:40:59] <someprimetime> people just aren't constantly monitoring it for questions 24/7
[14:41:58] <ngharo> helping is hard without bot-t :'(
[14:45:26] <draginx> _drag.draggable("option", "revert", true); any reason why this wouldn't revert?
[14:47:10] <melii> http://jsfiddle.net/s2T9n/ ok, now i create a live demo..pls be so nice and check it out
[14:49:32] <someprimetime> melii: datatype should be dataType fwiw
[14:49:51] <someprimetime> still don't know what you're trying to do
[14:50:09] <melii> oh allright thanks
[14:52:19] <melii> i use the moethod live
[14:52:24] <melii> change it to click
[14:52:36] <melii> and see that the dialog don´t will open
[14:53:06] <ngharo> melii: http://jsfiddle.net/s2T9n/2/
[14:53:39] <melii> what u change?
[14:54:05] <ngharo> html in the script window, didn't select jquery from the "Choose framework" on left
[14:54:39] <melii> its just an example which only run on localsite
[14:55:07] <melii> because load() can only load internal sites, not external
[14:55:40] <ngharo> yep
[14:55:53] <melii> ngharo thanks but dataType wasnt my problem
[14:56:06] <ngharo> what is your problem?
[14:58:22] <melii> my problem is the live() method which prevents my data be submitted correctly
[14:58:46] <melii> i tested the same with the click() method and it works perfect
[14:59:21] <someprimetime> try on('click', ?
[14:59:45] <melii> i tried but it didnt work
[15:00:59] <AntoineSolutions> I think I am seeing a bug in jquery 1.4.4 and came here per the bug reporting guidelines before reporting the bug. Here is a link that I found to a similar bug report that was closed due to inactivity of the reporter: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8816
[15:01:50] <AntoineSolutions> I am not sure if this is a Chrome or a jQuery bug, that is why I have come here first.
[15:02:22] <AntoineSolutions> jsFiddle does not reproduce the problem as the problem is dependent on using chromes "refresh" button.
[15:04:37] <AntoineSolutions> The issue I am seeing is that when first visiting a page, images are loaded before jquery is run, perhaps because they are not cached. When refreshing a page, the jquery is running before the image is loaded and therfore is reporting an incorrect height for the wrapping element.
[15:06:04] <jstonne> Antoine: I've encountered this height/width issue a very long time ago…. but not related to images.
[15:07:04] <jstonne> It just went away as time goes by I guess either Chrome fixed itself or jQuery did.
[15:07:11] <AntoineSolutions> so perhaps the image loading/not-loading is just a coincidence? But I am still wondering if this is a jquery issu?
[15:07:42] <AntoineSolutions> I see... I am using the latest jquery 1.4.4 and the latest stable chrome release.
[15:07:58] <AntoineSolutions> latest jquery in the 1.4 release cycle that is ;)
[15:08:32] <exnihilo> not 100% jquery related, but if I have a complex page with media and callbacks and what not, what is the best way to save it correctly with history.pushstate?  I'm currently getting an error on some scripts when I use the back button.
[15:09:08] <kamo> hello all
[15:09:22] <kamo> I am having a wierd problem
[15:09:35] <draginx> Is there anyway to "refresh" jquery-ui's selectors?
[15:09:57] <kamo> IE 9 is aborting POST requests when not in compat. mode
[15:10:22] <kamo> Any ideas why on this?
[15:10:36] <kamo> And the URL is the same in the requests
[15:11:49] <jstonne> Antoine: I remembered manually adding width + margin width + border width to get the final outer width.
[15:13:02] <AntoineSolutions> jstone: appreciate the info. I just tested with jquery 1.7.1 and it is still reproducible. I think I'll go ahead with the bug report but will use your method as a work around!
[15:13:40] <jstonne> Antoine: It could be 2 completely different issue yeah. :-) I'm just saying.
[15:14:17] <AntoineSolutions> jstonne: Yes, our issues could be unrelated. I'll still try out your workaround and hopefully it will work =D
[15:17:16] <jstonne> kamo: It might be doctype related. I'm not sure.
[15:17:43] <kamo> This is the DOCTYPE

[15:18:17] <jstonne> kamo: Hah okay so we're both talking different things then. Sorry. :-)
[15:19:05] <kamo> LOL I thing so
[15:19:42] <jstonne> draginx: what do you mean by "refresh"?
[15:19:56] <hopsy_> hey coldhead
[15:20:35] <hopsy_> I asked a new ninthfloor account :p
[15:21:24] <inki> hi
[15:21:45] <inki> I'm using append() to dynamically append lots of spans inside a wrapper span
[15:22:11] <inki> problem is that the spans don't wrap but grow infinitely to the right
[15:22:32] <inki> when I grab some dozens of the dynamically created spans and hardcode them, they span nicely
[15:22:52] <kamo> IE 9 is aborting POST requests when not in compat. mode
[15:22:56] <kamo> And the URL is the same in the requests
[15:25:10] <jstonne> inki: put your code on jsfiddle/pastebin
[15:30:21] <inki> jstonne: http://nopaste.me/paste/4220437784efba67e58e1b
[15:30:34] <inki> I am appending lots of these
[15:30:54] <inki> and there's no way to stop them growing to the right
[15:31:19] <draginx> jstonne: adding new objects to dom
[15:32:48] <inki> ?
[15:34:28] <pur3forlyphe> is their a way of delaying a function i.e. functionName().delay(1000); - which is not working
[15:35:28] <jstonne> inki: Are you saying *visually* growing to the right? Because <span> tags are inline elements, they display inline .
[15:35:38] <cpgo> setTimeout? pur3forlyphe
[15:36:06] <inki> jstonne: yes, visually
[15:36:12] <inki> they break the outside container
[15:36:32] <inki> i will deploy it on the testing machine, hold on
[15:36:47] <pur3forlyphe> nice one thanks cpgo
[15:37:03] <jstonne> inki: You gotta look into your CSS man.
[15:37:32] <inki> no, it weird, when i hardcode those spans there, they wrap nicely
[15:37:41] <inki> it comes from the dynamic adding
[15:38:14] <jstonne> inki: Your seeing this issue on IE or all browsers?
[15:39:06] <inki> I'm seeing it in ff and chrome
[15:39:09] <inki> not touching ie
[15:39:14] <jstonne> ooh.
[15:40:56] <asdf_> use <div> instead or change span to display: block in your css ?
[15:45:07] <asdf_> inki: unless you actually want them to wrap like that visually?
[15:45:22] <inki> tried that
[15:48:34] <inki> jstonne, asdf_: I've msgd you credentials
[15:48:59] <draginx> Anyway to get a draggable to revert back to it's original position even if the contianment was true?
[15:51:56] <draginx> How can I get a draggable object to revert within an ajax block that's being called within the draggable block?
[15:52:03] <draginx> draggable-drop block
[15:53:47] <exnihilo> is there a good way to fire events on a page load regardless of if it was initiated by the back button or directly?
[15:54:14] <exnihilo> I'm losing all my events and dom manipulations on back for some things (I think because as part of the page transition I need to set the innerHTML to "" in some elements)
[16:05:42] <asdf_> inki: maybe easiest solution would be just to float: left those story nodes
[16:23:47] <djaquay> calling $.post, response says content-length of 23k, but my callback isn't getting called
[16:25:16] <djaquay> code is at http://djaquay.homelinux.org/xj.js
[16:31:09] <inki> asdf`: works, thanx!
[16:31:11] <inki> night
[16:31:11] <djaquay> the response is coming back "application/json"
[16:31:33] <djaquay> my call: $.post(url, JSON.stringify(request), displaySearchResult, "json");
[16:34:31] <rknLA> anyone in here used valum's ajax-uploader?
[16:35:35] <draginx> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8662710/jquery-ui-draggable-doesnt-work-inside-an-ajax-block
[16:36:29] <rknLA> i'm trying to modify the generated input to include multipart, since for some reason it doesnt
[16:47:28] <djaquay> any ideas why calling $.post() would result in a 200 OK, but not have the callback getting called?
[16:55:46] <abjorn> coldhead: I cannot tell you how many times I ran myisamchk at work today
[16:55:48] <abjorn> cause it was a lot
[16:55:53] <abjorn> fuckin mysql
[16:57:16] <draginx> Can ui.draggable be applied within an ajax block?
[17:00:35] <aghouseh> anyone have a quick way to find out if an input is the last one inside a given container?
[17:01:13] <aghouseh> i can get the last input and compare it against another obj, but its not testing as true when i do ==

[17:05:03] <someprimetime> is this a decent way to make a slideshow?
[17:05:03] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/BgJDC/
[17:05:12] <someprimetime> it's very early stage, but just something i mocked up real quick
[17:08:14] <djaquay> ok, switching to $.ajax, to get proper error call
[17:08:30] <CantUnplug> someprimetime why not make it into a plugin?
[17:08:40] <someprimetime> CantUnplug: what do you mean?
[17:08:43] <CantUnplug> perfectly fine not too, just curious.. seems like perfect 'plugin' thing
[17:08:48] <someprimetime> ah
[17:08:52] <someprimetime> to use a plugin?
[17:09:03] <CantUnplug> to use.. or to put your code and make it one
[17:09:13] <someprimetime> i'm doing it a) for the learning portion and b) to make it fully customizable with our current website
[17:09:21] <CantUnplug> $('#yurUL').slideshow();
[17:09:38] <someprimetime> right
[17:10:03] <CantUnplug> cool.  didnt mean to say 'do it this way' .. just curious
[17:10:41] <someprimetime> yeah, no worries ;)
[17:24:29] <djaquay> so i'm calling $.ajax(), getting error() callback, but textStatus is "error" and errorThrown is blank.  not really useful.  am i missing something?
[17:26:24] <XPherior> I feel pretty noob, but I've never seen a selector like this. What's it mean? $('.item img')
[17:26:39] <XPherior> Used to seeing something like "img .item"
[17:27:01] <someprimetime> all images within the class item
[17:27:06] <melii> why i get more than 1 dialogboxes when i click twice? how can i destroy a dialog? http://jsfiddle.net/ngspQ/
[17:27:21] <XPherior> someprimetime: Hm, that's what I thought. Wonder why it's not working for me. Back to the drawing board!
[17:27:32] <someprimetime> what's not working?
[17:27:41] <XPherior> <img class="item" ...
[17:27:46] <XPherior> It should select that, right?
[17:28:04] <someprimetime> what you posted means <div class="item"><img src="blah.jpg"></div>
[17:28:15] <someprimetime> it'll apply whatever to that image within that div/span container
[17:28:27] <someprimetime> +whatever rule you specify
[17:28:50] <XPherior> someprimetime: Why does it apply on a div? I find that kind of weird.
[17:28:51] <someprimetime> if you want to target <img class="item" you'd just do $('.item')
[17:28:59] <someprimetime> because that's the first selector you chose
[17:29:08] <XPherior> Oh balls. That makes sense.
[17:29:20] <someprimetime> it's structured like the dom so whatever you put after the parent selector is affected too
[17:29:57] <XPherior> someprimetime: Yeah, that seems reasonable. Thanks. :)
[17:30:03] <someprimetime> np
[18:04:20] <BinaryMaster> working to long brain fart if(!$(sel).hasClass()) works right

[19:22:43] <systemfault> pythonirc1011: Try to select the element and call .click() on it?
[19:24:17] <pythonirc1011> systemfault: So, I guess i should create a hidden element, change its link to what i want and call click() on it?
[19:56:41] <Smashcat> Hi, I've used ($window).bind("mousedown"), mousemove and mouseup to check when the mouse is being dragged over something on the page. It works the first time ok, but the next time (unless I click somewhere else on the page) the mouse tries to drag the content of the page. Is this a bug in jquery or Firefox (the browser I'm using)?
[19:57:46] <Smashcat> I've tried using stopPropagation() on the event, but it still allows the user to drag content out.

[20:11:22] <kevinpunya> hello there
[20:11:40] <kevinpunya> i need assistant, i'm new in jquery, i'm not sure how to theme a table
[20:11:56] <kevinpunya> any pointers?
[20:13:12] <systemfault> Use CSS.
[20:13:55] <kevinpunya> i included the redmond theme and my table hasn't changed
[20:14:27] <kevinpunya> i've included the file correctly, do i need to add additional things on to the table?
[20:14:37] <kevinpunya> like an id, or execute a function?
[20:16:49] <tfitts> is it not possible to preload images from a different domain?
[20:17:19] <tfitts> I've got a preload function and I can see it preload the images in firebug, but then when I use jquery to change the page so the image will actually show up it just loads it again
[20:24:01] <tgodar> wanted to use a plugin that used new 1.7 on/off methods.  Now I'm getting the sense that using any other jQuery UI plugins is going to be difficult.  Even .dialog() broke .

[20:31:34] <xrated> Rndnick, what's your javascript knowledge like
[20:31:45] <tgodar> was thinking something like load two versions of jQuery, use one for the other plugin
[20:31:52] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ xrated
[20:31:53] <bot-t> xrated, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[20:32:25] <xrated> I know jQuery >.<
[20:32:27] <xrated> Sorta
[20:32:28] <xrated> maybe
[20:32:33] <xrated> Only on days that end with y
[20:32:48] <Rndnick> my problem is not understanding jquery
[20:32:51] <Rndnick> its that it doesnt work
[20:33:05] <Eviltwin> jQuery doesn't work?
[20:33:11] <Rndnick> it doesnt
[20:33:17] <xrated> It does
[20:33:19] <Eviltwin> jQuery does exactly what its supposed to do
[20:33:23] <Rndnick> it doesnt
[20:33:25] <tgodar> is there a channel just for venting?  There should be
[20:33:26] <xrated> Rndnick, pastie the code you're working with
[20:33:28] <Rndnick> why else would i ask question here
[20:33:37] <Rndnick> sure
[20:33:42] <xrated> tgodar: #jesus

[20:37:12] <kevinpunya> any assist for applying the redmond theme into a table i'm having?
[20:37:20] <Eviltwin> Rndnick: What doesn't work?
[20:37:31] <Rndnick> If I click the <p>, nothing happens
[20:37:38] <Rndnick> There is no slide
[20:37:40] <tomoyuki28jp> I wanna place images in the shape of a heart. Is there a easy way or library that I can use?
[20:37:49] <Eviltwin> Rndnick: What makes you think there would be a slide?
[20:37:51] <Smashcat> Rndnick: Check you're using a web browser, and not a potato
[20:38:00] <Eviltwin> Rndnick: What browser are you using?
[20:38:08] <systemfault> Potato 3.1? :D
[20:38:12] <Rndnick> I tried in 3 browsers
[20:38:17] <Rndnick> Chrome, IE, Firefox
[20:38:32] <Eviltwin> Okay, channel
[20:38:37] <Eviltwin> Anyone else here
[20:38:39] <xrated> Do you have something like NoScript installed?
[20:38:45] <Eviltwin> Open this: http://jsfiddle.net/mQABA/
[20:38:47] <Rndnick> No
[20:38:51] <Eviltwin> In the bottom right corner
[20:38:54] <Rndnick> It works on jsfiddle.net
[20:38:57] <Eviltwin> Click the lines
[20:38:59] <Eviltwin> .........
[20:39:04] <Eviltwin> So it works just fine
[20:39:16] <Eviltwin> Something YOU are doing is the problem, not jQuery
[20:39:17] <ajpiano> Rndnick: if you can't show us an example of it failing that you are experiencing, we will be unable to assist you further
[20:39:38] <Rndnick> Eviltwin : ?
[20:39:51] <Eviltwin> It works on jsFiddle
[20:39:53] <Eviltwin> So it works
[20:40:04] <Rndnick> I said it works on jsFiddle
[20:40:16] <Rndnick> But I dont want to show it on jsFiddle
[20:40:20] <Eviltwin> That means that you're doing something incorrectly in the version that's not working
[20:40:21] <Rndnick> I want to show it on another site
[20:40:26] <ajpiano> Rndnick: we are not looking at what you are looking at, the fact that you're saying it doesn't work in your test page is irrelevant
[20:40:41] <ajpiano> unless we can see the same test page

[20:41:01] <ajpiano> Rndnick: don't do that.
[20:41:25] <ajpiano> we all saw the code, pasting it into the channel again is not the same as seeing the code fail in a browser
[20:41:33] <Rndnick> I don't think you saw it well
[20:41:44] <ajpiano> Rndnick: you should make sure that jQuery is actually loading properly and that there are no errors in your console
[20:41:55] <Rndnick> Where do I check for errors ?
[20:42:06] <Eviltwin> Rndnick: Your tone is beginning to cross a line

[20:42:07] <xrated> If you're using Chrome you can hit CTRL+SHIFT+I
[20:42:12] <ajpiano> you use your debugger, in firefox you use firebug or in chrome you use the chrome developer tools

[20:43:43] <Eviltwin> You don't actually have to read the docs if you know everything in them :P
[20:43:43] <ajpiano> Rndnick: can you post that exact test page somewhere on the internet
[20:44:23] <ajpiano> and then we can all see it not working?
[20:44:35] <Rndnick> The one I just posted in channel ?
[20:44:39] <Eviltwin> ...
[20:44:43] <xrated> Yeah, host it somewhere.
[20:44:47] <Eviltwin> We want to see a URL
[20:44:50] <Eviltwin> That in our browsers
[20:45:00] <Eviltwin> Will have a bunch of <p> tags that don't disappear when you click them
[20:45:00] <ajpiano> not the string contents of the html and javascript, an actual site we can visit in a browser ^^
[20:45:10] <Eviltwin> Yet has everything you just showed us
[20:45:26] <Eviltwin> If you click on line 14 in the pastebin, it won't disappear

[20:46:41] <kevinpunya> how do i apply a theme to a button? --> http://jsfiddle.net/AXn3K/
[20:46:55] <systemfault> CSS :D
[20:46:56] <Eviltwin> kevinpunya: I believe that's CSS-based
[20:47:02] <Eviltwin> So you need to include the appropriate CSS
[20:47:09] <tfitts> if a file has an expires Fri, 21 Dec 2012 12:00:00 GMT in the header is there a reason my browser would keep requesting it?
[20:47:20] <Eviltwin> And I think you can read more about it here: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[20:47:23] <tfitts> probably more of an httpd question I guess
[20:47:49] <Rndnick> $ is not defined
[20:47:51] <Rndnick> on line 6
[20:48:06] <Rndnick> http://pastebin.com/uqiQjn7i
[20:48:11] <Eviltwin> tfitts: Depending on the Cache-control settings, it might check with the server to verify that it hasn't changed
[20:48:11] <ajpiano> kevinpunya: if you actually load the css properly (using the add resources thing on the left) and include jquery and jqueryui , it works http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/AXn3K/1/
[20:48:19] <ajpiano> Rndnick: that means that jQuery is not being loaded properly
[20:48:33] <Eviltwin> Rndnick: fixingthesejquery.com
[20:48:36] <ajpiano> it means that likely the path to jquery.js is wrong
[20:49:00] <tfitts> Eviltwin: how about fully redownloading them even if they haven't changed
[20:49:26] <Eviltwin> tfitts: Do you have a debugger or something attached right now
[20:49:33] <tfitts> just firebug
[20:49:34] <Eviltwin> Are you in some sort of private browsing mode?
[20:49:40] <Eviltwin> These all adjust cache policies, I believe
[20:49:41] <tfitts> no
[20:50:16] <kevinpunya> Eviltwin: CSS hmm...
[20:50:40] <ajpiano> kevinpunya: did you see the message i just sent you
[20:50:54] <tfitts> does preloading images with javascript ignore caching?
[20:51:05] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: i've seen it thanks, but how to we do it in the codes?
[20:51:10] <ajpiano> what
[20:51:14] <Eviltwin> tfitts: I think it depends on how you preload them
[20:51:38] <Rndnick> ajpiano : it doesnt work both locally and with link to google
[20:51:40] <ajpiano> kevinpunya: you "do it in the codes" by including jquery, jqueryui, and the jquery ui css in a web page and then having the javascript aht you had
[20:51:49] <Eviltwin> Rndnick: Define "works"
[20:51:51] <ajpiano> Rndnick: we can't help you unless we can see the page that it's failing on
[20:52:00] <ajpiano> that is just how it is
[20:52:17] <Rndnick> ajpiano : bullshit
[20:52:21] <Eviltwin> You just told us $ is undefined
[20:52:27] <Rndnick> ya
[20:52:31] <Rndnick> thats all you will see too
[20:52:31] <Eviltwin> Rndnick: We've shown you working examples...
[20:52:34] <ajpiano> Rndnick: watch your attitude, seriously.
[20:52:46] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: hmm ok, where is the FLICK theme defined?
[20:52:49] <tfitts> Eviltwin: turning it off and loading the images with the page(no preloading) and revisiting the page they are cached
[20:52:53] <Rndnick> jesus fucking christ
[20:52:59] <Rndnick> <Eviltwin> Rndnick: Define "works"
[20:53:01] <tfitts> so I'm pretty sure it's the preload method I'm using
[20:53:01] <Rndnick> WTF
[20:53:08] <xrated> I think you should calm down
[20:53:18] <Eviltwin> Rndnick: You need to calm down right now
[20:53:19] <Smashcat> Rndnick: Dude, you're a complete idiot. Don't you have an adult there to look after you?
[20:53:26] <ajpiano> kevinpunya: on that fiddle, or in general?
[20:53:38] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: on the fiddle
[20:53:38] <ajpiano> in the fiddle it's defined by being included in the "Add Resources" panel on the left side
[20:53:39] <xrated> Well, hopefully he doesn't do anything important.
[20:53:48] <ajpiano> i mean Manage Resources
[20:53:59] <vladikoff> lol
[20:54:04] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: i'm trying to learn how to theme a table, but i can't even theme a button property =/
[20:54:35] <ajpiano> kevinpunya: in jsfiddle, the "css" pane is for actually writing css, not linking to css
[20:54:45] <ajpiano> manage resources is for including arbitrary external js/css resources
[20:54:53] <systemfault> kevinpunya: HTML then CSS then Javascript the jQuery.
[20:55:14] <systemfault> In that order.
[20:55:29] <Eviltwin> I wonder if Rndnick ever gets the help he's looking for
[20:55:30] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: I see, but how do you theme the button in your example? in Fiddle?
[20:55:42] <systemfault> Eviltwin: Idiots never get helped.
[20:55:56] <ajpiano> kevinpunya: the .button() method adds all the appropriate classes to the element
[20:56:02] <tfitts> Eviltwin: that kind of help costs a lot of money
[20:56:17] <Smashcat> Not being funny, but if he's having problems even cutting and pasting code from a webpage, he should maybe start with the basics - learning simple html first.
[20:56:34] <systemfault> Good html can be difficult.
[20:56:36] <xrated> Has he been in this channel before?
[20:56:39] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: oh! so if i change the css file i could change the theming of that button! ok got it!
[20:56:44] <ajpiano> kevinpunya: yup!
[20:56:49] <ajpiano> xrated: no he is new
[20:56:50] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: next question, table! hehe
[20:57:08] <ajpiano> kevinpunya: a table is considerably different, because there isn't a jquery ui widget (presently) that applies theming/behaviour to tables
[20:57:49] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: i saw that in the http://www.tablefixedheader.com/fullpagedemo/ the table could be changed...wondering how it is done
[20:58:11] <ajpiano> it's a plugin that manipulates the table...
[20:58:27] <ajpiano> and it supports jquery ui themes
[20:58:43] <ajpiano> so if you include this plugin and apply it to a table, it should do the trick
[20:59:11] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: have you any place i can find an example on theming a table? without the plugin?
[20:59:28] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: or just to theme a table =)
[20:59:35] <ajpiano> look at the themes that plugin applies, and apply them yourself manually
[20:59:38] <ajpiano> :|
[21:00:02] <kevinpunya> i just saw the trigger to change the class from the buttons
[21:00:24] <kevinpunya> i think it's the "resultset" used in table's class
[21:00:38] <kevinpunya> well then i'll try to look further =/
[21:03:16] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: i didn't manage to find any thing linking to the resultset class
[21:03:31] <ajpiano> that's because it's that plugin that made the custom table styling
[21:03:37] <ajpiano> (in all likelihood)
[21:04:42] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: i don't understand, is that a plugin that is not in the source?
[21:05:02] <ajpiano> it isn't an official jquery ui plugin
[21:05:35] <dytrivedi> ?carousel
[21:05:35] <bot-t> Roundabout is a jQuery plugin that converts a structure of static HTML elements into a highly customizable turntable-like interactive area. (And now, not just turntables, but many shapes!) http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout/
[21:05:52] <ajpiano> it just is a plugin that uses and extend the jquery ui theming conventions
[21:06:47] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: i have to stop here, probably giving up searching now...can't find out how do he does it...=(
[21:08:15] <kevinpunya> ajpiano: thanks a lot for your assistance =)
[21:08:20] <ajpiano> kevinpunya: https://github.com/benjaminleouzon/tablefixedheader/blob/master/javascript/jquery.fixheadertable.js#L422
[21:08:51] <ajpiano> he does it by writing javascript that enhances the existing talbe and applies the css classes that are a mix between those applied in the jquery ui theme and some stcutual classes he creates in his own css
[21:09:12] <ajpiano> https://github.com/benjaminleouzon/tablefixedheader/blob/master/css/base.css
[21:09:27] <ajpiano> anyway, welcome :)
[21:12:09] <ppl> hi ajpiano
[21:12:31] <ajpiano> hello
[21:16:01] <kevinpunya> q
[21:16:31] <kevinpunya> whoopsi cant q with q hehehee have a nice day and happpppy new year! =)
[21:37:56] <ruby_on_tails> is there any plugin to make nice trees or networks, like molecular structures from a UL LI or something similar ?
[21:38:07] <ruby_on_tails> imagine a family tree sort of thing
[22:03:13] <groklinux> fairly new to jquery and i'm wanting to make sure that i'm going about this in the right way. i need to query a website (usda) for info that i'm loading into a db. there's a lot of data and i need to go back for at least a few years. is it possible and/or smart to have a page with a simple start and end date on it, have that passing a weekly or monthly increment to the page that's doing the...
[22:03:15] <groklinux> ...downloading/inserting the xml into the db. i could (and have) do the incrementing by hand but it's late and i don't feel like staying up all night waiting/changing dates and i'm trying to avoid timeouts.
[22:04:36] <jstonne> Are you trying to make an ajax call to a cross-domain site to retrieve information?
[22:05:47] <groklinux> no the ajax call is withing the domain...i basically just want to give it a couple year start/end date and have it feed the php page weekly or monthly start and end dates. it does the pull down from the usda and inserts it into the db
[22:08:19] <groklinux> my thinking being that if i have it fire off the next iteration of the loop when i get a return from the php script, it'll keep it from timing out/admins freaking out from seeing something running for hours
[22:08:49] <Eviltwin> Are you using jQuery to take data from the USDA's database and put it in a different database?
[22:09:15] <Eviltwin> Perhaps I'm misunderstanding
[22:09:31] <jstonne> He said no. So I assume his PHP script is doing that part.
[22:09:32] <groklinux> no, that's already being handled by the php script...i'm basically lazy/tired and don't feel like feeding the php script fresh start/end dates all night
[22:10:01] <groklinux> it takes about 5-10 minutes to run a month's worth of data
[22:10:22] <Eviltwin> 5-10 minutes to query USDA or for all that data to trickle from PHP?
[22:11:11] <groklinux> to get it from the usda to the host is what takes the time
[22:11:24] <Eviltwin> From USDA to the server?
[22:11:40] <groklinux> yeah
[22:11:50] <Eviltwin> What format does it get sent it?
[22:11:53] <groklinux> xml
[22:12:12] <Eviltwin> Can you be parsing it as its being transmitted?
[22:12:38] <jstonne> so grok basically you're saying that you want to use jquery to automate the work of making a php request to your server, so that your server pulls a months worth of data from USDA… month to month.
[22:12:55] <groklinux> no, that'd be nice...it basically sends a post query to the usda server and then am using a get_contents to pull it in
[22:13:08] <groklinux> yessir
[22:13:11] <jstonne> grok you increased your timeout in your php.ini is that it?
[22:13:22] <jstonne> i mean 5 to 10 minutes.. dude.. php script times out in 60 seconds default.
[22:13:44] <groklinux> yeah i bumped it up already but like i said, i didn't want to freak the admins out because it's probably going to run for a few hours
[22:13:57] <jstonne> Ah now I see where you're headed.
[22:14:32] <groklinux> lot's of little bites instead of one giant gobble lol
[22:14:39] <jstonne> lol
[22:15:41] <groklinux> i thought about cron jobbing a bunch of wgets and then process the files in the morning but i thought this might be easier and give me an excuse to do some simple jquery
[22:16:55] <Eviltwin> Does this old data change?
[22:17:13] <Eviltwin> Oh is this a one-time one-off thing?
[22:17:21] <jstonne> well okay I do not know if there's a browser timeout imposed on each ajax request…
[22:17:31] <groklinux> no, it's that day's current prices for every fruit and vegetable being offered for sale that day...so only historical data
[22:17:41] <jstonne> but i foresee you might need to have 2 parts to it… one that polls for an indication of whether or not the current pulling job is successful..
[22:17:50] <jstonne> and the other makes a request to start the next batch job.
[22:18:21] <jstonne> kinda like those comet chat thingy thing… right? eviltwin?
[22:18:26] <groklinux> yeah i thought i might run into that as well, that's why i was thinking maybe shortening it down to weekly
[22:18:27] <Eviltwin> It sounds like the data the USDA is offering is a dump, something designed to be downloaded once and thrown in a relational database for your queries
[22:18:59] <Eviltwin> Not pulled frequently
[22:19:19] <Eviltwin> In fact you might even be violating their TOS by pulling frequently
[22:19:29] <groklinux> et - it is, and i thought about just running a single *large* query and pull it in by hand...but where's the fun in that?
[22:19:56] <Eviltwin> There's fun in not having the USDA block your IPs
[22:19:59] <groklinux> no, they don't mind, i have talked to their admin and explained what we're doing
[22:20:28] <groklinux> and we're big enough that they're willing to accommodate us :)
[22:21:04] <groklinux> there's simpler ways to go about this...if i wanted, i could simply ask them for a dump via ftp but again, lack of fun
[22:22:08] <Eviltwin> Based on (what I've read of) what you've said (which isn't much), jQuery doesn't sound like the answer
[22:22:21] <Eviltwin> But I must leave now
[22:22:33] <Eviltwin> Was just dropping in for a few minutes
[22:22:48] <jstonne> grok, i did worse by batch downloading lynda video tutorials with a jquery script that runs as a firefox add-on. (oops i shouldn't be saying that)
[22:22:54] <Soleino> Hello i'm a newbee in jquery
[22:22:59] <jstonne> that was after i paid my month subscription that is. ;)
[22:23:12] <groklinux> thanks ET...sanity check was what i was looking for
[22:23:21] <Soleino> i want to know please how to correctly write a line
[22:23:24] <Soleino> $('.image-caption').html(this.img);
[22:23:26] <groklinux> i love lynda
[22:23:32] <Soleino> $('.image-caption').html(this.p);
[22:23:34] <Soleino> :p
[22:23:43] <Soleino> sorry
[22:23:47] <Eviltwin> Soleino: Completely dependent on what "this" is and what "p" is
[22:23:54] <groklinux> sorry for screwing up your paste Soleino
[22:24:04] <Soleino> this is a div a p is a text
[22:24:27] <Soleino> i want to put the p content into .image-caption
[22:24:29] <Eviltwin> Did you see ?.text
[22:24:29] <bot-t> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[22:25:00] <Chibby_> p content? just the text() ^^^ or the html? .html()
[22:25:02] <zChris> I cant find javascript api. Anyone that can point me to a good site?
[22:25:05] <Soleino> this is a div that content an img and a p
[22:25:24] <Soleino> lets try text() :)
[22:25:40] <Chibby_> zChris: i use http://www.javascriptkit.com/ don't know if it's good though!
[22:25:42] <Eviltwin> zChris: "JavaScript API"?
[22:25:48] <Eviltwin> JavaScript is a language
[22:26:01] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ zChris
[22:26:01] <bot-t> zChris, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[22:26:05] <Soleino> in a sample it was this.alt
[22:26:16] <Soleino> for this=img and alt, the img alt
[22:26:30] <Soleino> in my case i've this=div and the alt is a p :p
[22:27:37] <zChris> Chibby_, thanks :)
[22:30:55] <zChris> I assume that this points to the calling object in a function. Can i use it somehow to traverse through DOM structure with jQuery? For example i have a link <a> that calls functionX() can i then use this to get <a>'s parent ?
[22:37:49] <motaka2> Hello, How can I add one element right after another?
[22:38:11] <jstonne> .next()?
[22:38:32] <jstonne> insertAfter i think
[22:38:48] <jstonne> oh its .after();
[22:38:57] <Chibby_> yah
[22:50:59] <Soleino> $('.paginate').html(str);
[22:51:06] <Soleino> how to say excluvely for this
[22:51:24] <Soleino> not all .paginate in the page
[22:51:48] <Soleino> plz ..
[22:52:32] <Chibby_> exclusively for what?
[22:52:46] <Chibby_> oh
[22:52:48] <Chibby_> you mean
[22:52:50] <Soleino> is this correct for example
[22:52:52] <Soleino> $.next('.paginate').html(str);
[22:52:52] <Chibby_> $(this).html(str);
[22:53:03] <Soleino> this '.paginate'
[22:53:04] <Soleino> :p
[22:53:09] <Soleino> i dont know how to write it
[22:53:22] <Chibby_> uh..
[22:53:29] <Soleino> or next .paginate only
[22:53:55] <Chibby_> you want all elements after elements with class paginate to have html set to str?
[22:54:01] <Soleino> no
[22:54:10] <Chibby_> which ones then?
[22:54:12] <Soleino> only and exclusively the next one
[22:54:22] <Chibby_> next one after what?
[22:54:36] <Soleino> after the 'this'
[22:54:37] <Soleino> :p
[22:55:01] <Chibby_> it's the very next element after 'this'?
[22:55:20] <Soleino> yes
[22:55:29] <Chibby_> $(this).next().html(str);
[22:56:37] <Soleino> i mean .. not really the next one
[22:56:40] <Soleino> wrapper by two divs
[22:56:49] <Soleino> wrapped
[23:13:19] <AlbireoX> Hi, anyone here know of a good graphing library?
[23:15:39] <systemfault> highcharts?
[23:16:22] <AlbireoX> thanks
[23:16:42] <AlbireoX> systemfault: lol, you were in the other room
[23:17:27] <systemfault> I'm spying on you.
[23:23:58] <zChris> Will animate stop working in chrome when they remove event.layerX and Y ?
[23:24:14] <motaka2> jstonne: Thanks
[23:24:23] <systemfault> Probably.
[23:25:04] <systemfault> layerX and layerY... are probably prehistoric :P
[23:25:43] <zChris> hmm, are there ideas on a workaround?
[23:28:09] <systemfault> Can you upgrade to 1.7?
[23:28:43] <systemfault> Or perhaps it's one of the plugins you use..
[23:28:57] <Soleino> hello
[23:29:04] <Soleino> re(hello) :p
[23:29:12] <Soleino> im trying to customise jquery.cycle
[23:29:13] <Soleino> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/goto.html
[23:29:20] <zChris> systemfault, im not using a plugin as far as i know :)
[23:29:41] <Soleino> how can i go to the last page in this case ? (dynamicly)
[23:29:42] <jstonne> oooh layerX/layerY….. somebody just brought me back to the netscape days
[23:30:13] <systemfault> zChris: But can you upgrade to 1.7?
[23:30:19] <systemfault> zChris: If yes... do it.
[23:30:46] <systemfault> If you currently use 1.6, it shouldn't break anything.
[23:31:18] <systemfault> And as a bonus, you'll get the new cool .on/.off functions for event handling.
[23:33:06] <zChris> systemfault, alright i will look to it. But what is on and off ?
[23:33:23] <systemfault> The new cool way to handle events
[23:33:45] <systemfault> it basically does .bind/.live/.delegate...
[23:35:19] <zachera> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLCanvasElement> has no method 'attr'
[23:35:20] <zachera> :(
[23:36:35] <systemfault> Wrap it bitch!
[23:36:39] <systemfault> :/
[23:37:03] <systemfault> $(le_canvas_variable).attr('lulz');;
[23:37:34] <motaka2> hello lets say I need several edit boxes in a webpage which work like google suggest edit box ,  they all send request to one address
[23:38:01] <motaka2> but every one need it a div to open as suggest options
[23:38:43] <motaka2> I dont know how to start coding
[23:38:55] <motaka2> Can anyone help me ?
[23:43:51] <zachera> $(ctx).attr('width') => undefined
[23:46:13] <systemfault> zachera: Do you have a width attribute in the markup?
[23:46:30] <systemfault> Like <mytag width="245">
[23:46:55] <systemfault> Because that's what .attr is going to get.
[23:50:08] <morficus> zachera: you might be looking for $(ctx).css('width')
[23:50:25] <motaka2> no suggestion ?
[23:50:49] <morficus> motaka2: your question a little too broad. be a bit more specific
[23:51:47] <morficus> saying "I don't know where to start coding" is not a good place to start haha
[23:53:03] <motaka2> morficus: I have a page in which we set two(or N) locations form inputs, those inputs will suggest the users the name of a place. so if the user type in each of those two inputs he needs to see some suggestions.
[23:53:26] <motaka2> morficus: You are right . I am trying to be more specific
[23:55:40] <woozly> cant understand how to serialize an array?
