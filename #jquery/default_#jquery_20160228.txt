[04:50:28] <bobdobbs> which call should I use to get the first 'source' element from 'audio' in that paste?
[04:50:36] <bobdobbs> and then the second 'source' element in another operation?
[04:50:51] <bobdobbs> find, nth-child or children?
[07:23:39] <iDentity1337>         $('#notification').html('<a>'+data[i].text+'</a>');
[07:23:52] <iDentity1337> How can I add a href tag to that <a> ?
[07:24:09] <iDentity1337> which needs to be a variable 'data[i].url'
[07:25:26] <shoky_> var a = $('<a>').attr('href', data[i].url).text(data[i].text);  $('#notification').html(a);
[07:30:27] <iDentity1337> Thank you, shoky_
[07:30:28] <Gnjurac> hi 1 kinda dumb question but do i need normal js at all in my page cuz i guess 99% of stuff can be done with Jquery
[07:36:54] <shoky_> Gnjurac  jquery is for DOM manipulation and ajax, more or less. there are plenty of other things you can do that jquery is not for. like adding numbers.  also all jquery code is normal js code ;p
[07:41:08] <Gnjurac> how is it normal js it has difrent sytax
[07:41:37] <Gnjurac> i know it works in browser in js but coding part is difrent
[07:42:55] <dalbuschat> Gnjurac: It's still JavaScript, not a different language. It's merely a library that provides useful facilities.
[07:43:36] <Gnjurac> ye i dont know to eplain normal what i wanted to sey
[07:47:48] <fumk> Gnjurac: it depends on your needs
[07:49:38] <fumk> Gnjurac: and as dalbuschat said, in shorter way, if you use jquery, you use js
[07:54:55] <jancoow> Hi. I'm trying to get "jquery-knob" to work. I included the script and do exactly what they are saying on the github page. But the kno isn't generated.. https://jancokock.me/f/6f64f
[07:55:07] <jancoow> can someone see what i'm doing wrong?
[07:55:11] <jancoow> there are no errors in the log
[07:55:18] <jancoow> *consol
[08:08:47] <shoky_> jancoow: works fine  https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7hjLf3s0/
[11:20:01] <tlund> I am trying to manipulate a webpage via tampermonkey. It has an inputfield with: data-bind="value: idNumber, valueUpdate: ['keyup', 'propertychange', 'input']" and focusing that field and pressing a button makes the "submit" link work, but I seem to be unable to trigger that using jquery after I have done .val("blah") to fill in some data. any pointers?
[11:21:11] <tlund> The webpage in question is https://secure.sebkort.com/nis/m/sase/external/initEidLogin?method=sbid-mobil (and then click on "Mobilt BankID")
[11:21:18] <shoky_> tlund: that's a knockout.js binding.. you might be able to get the knockoutjs model data with  ko.dataFor(element)
[11:21:27] <shoky_> and update the model directly
[11:22:42] <tlund> shoky_: hmm, how do I specify the correct element to ko.dataFor?
[11:23:31] <shoky_> tlund: you just pass it.  if you have a jquery object you can get the dom node with [0] or .get(0)
[11:23:40] <tlund> foo = $(".text-input.id-number-input")[0]; ko.dataFor(foo);
[11:23:44] <shoky_> yes
[11:23:49] <tlund> "undefined" :(
[11:23:54] <shoky_> sec
[11:24:29] <shoky_> tlund: it's not undefined for me..
[11:24:35] <tlund> oh
[11:24:42] <shoky_> it's undefined before it's visible, yea
[11:25:00] <tlund> ah, oops
[11:25:05] <tlund> hadn't clicked :)
[11:25:18] <shoky_> so what action exactly do you want to emulate
[11:25:42] <shoky_> i happen to know knockout.js pretty good ;p
[11:26:10] <tlund> I want to fill out the textfield, enable the "Fortsätt" button and then simulate a click on that button
[11:26:21] <tlund> (but its not a button)
[11:26:39] <shoky_> what text makes it enabled?
[11:26:50] <shoky_> just for my testing..
[11:27:06] <tlund> 123456789012
[11:29:21] <shoky_> var vm = ko.dataFor( $(".text-input.id-number-input")[0] );   vm.idNumber('123456789012');
[11:29:24] <shoky_> that fills it in,
[11:30:23] <tlund> woohoo! :)
[11:30:27] <tlund> that worked, thanks
[11:30:51] <shoky_> ko.dataFor( $('.ok:visible')[0] ).gotoNext()     should "click" the button
[11:32:14] <tlund> it does indeed
[11:32:43] <shoky_> though   $('.ok:visible').click()  is fine too
[11:32:48] <tlund> shoky_: are you ok with me asking another question in /query so we don't bog up the channel, or do you want me to ask here? :)
[11:32:54] <shoky_> sure
[11:40:41] <shoky_> tlund btw if you dont wanna mess with ko stuff for updating inputs you can also do  .val('123456789012').trigger('change')
[11:41:15] <tlund> ah, ok
[11:41:40] <tlund> i was trying .trigger with keypress, that didn't work :(
[11:41:59] <shoky_> keyup would probably work, as it has the binding   valueUpdate: ['keyup', 'propertychange', 'input']"
[11:42:15] <shoky_> and change is the default that ko uses anyways
[11:42:22] <tlund> ok
[11:50:10] <jak2000> HI ALL good morning
[12:09:34] <jak2013> hi friends: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/8dutxncq/1/    <--- i detected in wich tr was clicked, my question is, how to specify the table name here:   $("tr").click(function() {  thanks
[12:12:40] <shoky_> jak2013 what do you mean by "specify the table name"
[12:13:24] <shoky_> .closest('table')  gets you the containing table
[12:14:26] <jak2013> i have 3 html tables, in all tables alert when user click. on a tr(row) i only want alert on a table named: "MytableItems"
[12:16:05] <shoky_> .closest('table')  gets you the containing table
[14:29:17] <xinming> Just curious, in html, Is that <div attr> the same as <div attr=""> ??
[14:29:45] <xinming> How do we write selector to select the div with exactly the <div attr></div> ?
[14:37:13] <Uhkis> $('div[attr]') should work
[14:46:20] <xinming> Uhkis: Thanks.
[14:46:32] <xinming> Uhkis: But, if we have <div attr></div>   <-- What does this mean?
[14:46:46] <xinming> <div attr=""></div>  <-- Means this?  or <div attr="attr"></div>
[14:57:33] <Uhkis> afaik it means the property is true
[15:12:44] <Nye> Hello, I have a problem with setting a svg as a background. https://jsfiddle.net/on2aypzc/3/ I tried encodeURIComponent and base64 encoding, but the svg doesn't want to show up in the background. Adding it to the css file manually works.
[16:55:16] <islalobo> What's the best way to check if and value is set in jquery ex $variable['value']['text'] vs $variable['value']['arrayName']
[17:55:46] <asidjazz> you want the js version of php arrays?
[17:56:05] <asidjazz> if (var['value']['text'] != 'undefined')
[17:56:29] <asidjazz> !== is better
[17:56:36] <asidjazz> .
[17:58:37] <shoky_> doubt you want to compare it to the string 'undefined' ;p
[18:17:29] <Wayland> Hey. I need help. Urgent help.
[18:18:02] <Wayland> Im trying to use AJAX with $.getJSON. And im having issues.
[18:19:13] <shoky_> yes?
[18:19:18] <Wayland> My code is $.getJSON('/short_url', { url_string: $('#url_string').val() }, function(data) { $("result").val(data.hash) });
[18:19:42] <Wayland> The thing is , i dont get return values. It sends the request but dosent catch the response
[18:20:07] <Wayland> If i try curling, it returns the json, but the js code isnt catching it.
[18:20:21] <shoky_> Wayland: put a console.log in the callback.  also  $("result")  looks for <result> elements ;p
[18:20:43] <Wayland> Yeah in the code is #result, typo :P
[18:21:22] <shoky_> check your console for errors.  add an error callback to the getJSON call and log the arguments.  check your browser's network tab and see what's happening with the request
[18:22:28] <Wayland> shoky_: 1- The console.log dosent appear to be called, as there is nothing on the console
[18:22:47] <Wayland> shoky_: 2- It just shows a red box with GET in the side
[18:22:55] <Wayland> (The network tab)
[18:23:03] <temhaa> hello
[18:23:06] <shoky_> Wayland: you can't expand it or something?  what browseR?
[18:23:38] <Wayland> shoky_: firefox
[18:23:46] <shoky_> Wayland:  and add an error callback e.g.  $.getJSON(...).fail(function(xhr, err, status) { console.log('ERROR', err, status) })
[18:25:16] <temhaa> I want to do load more content (scroll loading )like twitter. I tried this code to understand if I am at end of page. But It is not working for me. http://jsfiddle.net/ysho43vo/ this code is working in jsfiddle but its now working in my local. because of everytime $(document).height() is equal to $(window).height()
[18:25:45] <Wayland> shoky_: Its calling the fail callback.
[18:26:03] <shoky_> Wayland: you should be able to see more stuff about the request in the network tab by clicking on the request
[18:26:18] <shoky_> and see the headers and response on the right
[18:26:37] <shoky_> Wayland: and what is it logging
[18:27:01] <Wayland> shoky_: Thre are no responses. Also, the connection type is keep-alive
[18:27:46] <shoky_> what did the error callback log?
[18:28:08] <Wayland> Wait
[18:28:54] <Wayland> shoky_: "ERROR error"
[18:29:45] <shoky_> Wayland try running it in chrome and see if you get an error in the console
[18:30:11] <shoky_> though that's usually useful for cross-domain issues, which you cant be having if your url is really just '/short_url'
[18:31:18] <shoky_> Wayland are you running your site from the filesystem btw, or on a webserver
[18:32:51] <Wayland> shoky_: 1- In chrome, i can see two line breaks for a second and then they disappear. Also the AJAX dosent work too. 2- Its a Flask app running on localhost:5000
[18:33:09] <shoky_> two line breaks where? what do you mean
[18:33:34] <Wayland> shoky_: In the console, two empty lines for a sec and then they disappear
[18:33:49] <shoky_> uhm weird.
[18:34:00] <shoky_> and no error?  what does the network tab show
[18:34:17] <shoky_> maybe screenshot it, donno :S
[18:34:42] <Wayland> shoky_: Not even showing the request
[18:35:18] <shoky_> are you sure the code is running
[18:35:46] <TheWarlord> Hey all!
[18:35:50] <Wayland> shoky_: Yes, i can see the app runing on my terminal
[18:36:49] <Wayland> shoky_: And its doing what its supposed to do. Also when i click the button it clearly makes a response
[18:37:30] <shoky_> Wayland: donno , can't help much more without seeing it for myself,  not much of what you're describing makes any sense ;p
[18:37:42] <Wayland> shoky_: Yeah
[18:38:01] <Wayland> shoky_: I have used getJSON multiple times and i never got that
[18:38:13] <shoky_> the url is really '/short_url'  ?
[18:38:28] <Wayland> shoky_: Yup.
[18:39:08] <shoky_> reproduce your issue on jsfiddle or a testcase or share a live link to your site ;p  sry
[18:39:46] <Wayland> shoky_: Okay. may take some time
[18:40:05] <TheWarlord> Get it done!
[18:40:08] <TheWarlord> lol
[18:40:20] <Wayland> (TheWarlord is the one that requested the thing, btw)
[18:41:30] <TheWarlord> I just can't figure it out, I am taking a look and just experiencing the same problems.
[18:41:35] <shoky_> btw a fiddle probably is not going to help here, i pretty much meant a link to a live testcase/your siet
[18:41:50] <shoky_> just in case you were starting to make a fiddle.
[18:42:51] <Wayland> shoky_: Im deploying it on Azure, but it may take up to 15 mins
[18:42:55] <Wayland> really depends
[18:43:08] <shoky_> that's alright
[18:46:38] <Wayland> Oh lol
[18:46:48] <MSAzure> :)
[18:51:12] <Wayland> FTP is transfering a large chunk of 30kb.
[18:51:22] <Wayland> FTP is really fast, huh?
[18:51:55] <shoky_> ftp speed is fine ;p
[18:51:57] <temhaa> I need to help
[18:52:29] <temhaa> always $(window).height is equal to $(document).height
[18:53:30] <temhaa> my code something like that: https://jsfiddle.net/14po8o32/   it's working normal and true in jsfiddle but I guess I forgot something. What is reason of my problem.
[19:00:29] <Wayland> Its on 104.45.156.250:5000
[19:03:24] <shoky_> Wayland: connection is timing out
[19:04:12] <Wayland> shoky_: Forgot to set the firewall :P
[19:05:52] <Wayland> shoky_: Working now?
[19:06:03] <shoky_> Wayland: nope
[19:07:30] <Wayland> shoky_: Let me see
[19:09:00] <temhaa> anybody are there to help me
[19:29:52] <Wayland> shoky_: 192.81.214.33:5000
[19:32:39] <shoky_> Wayland: ah. the form is getting submitted too, which cancels the ajax request
[19:32:47] <shoky_> Wayland: add type="button"  on your <button>
[19:33:55] <Wayland> shoky_: OH.
[19:34:00] <shoky_> Wayland: and it does appear in chrome but gets erased when the form submit reloads the whole page. you can check "Preserve Log" to see it
[19:34:00] <Wayland> shoky_: Yeah, works
[19:35:35] <Wayland> shoky_: Thanks so much!
[19:36:20] <shoky_> np
[19:42:55] <z1haze> how would i go about getting a data-attr from the selected option in a html select
[19:43:44] <shoky_> z1haze:  $('select').find(':selected').data('attr')
[19:44:01] <z1haze> thank you
[19:44:18] <z1haze> how come i can use $(this).val() to get the value
[19:44:27] <z1haze> but i cant use $(this).data('id')
[19:44:43] <shoky_> because the selected option's value is automatically copied to the <select>'s value
[19:44:47] <shoky_> by the browser
[19:45:00] <z1haze> ok
[19:45:03] <z1haze> thank you
[19:45:52] <z1haze> can i use $(this).find(...
[19:46:02] <shoky_> if `this` is the <select>, sure
[19:46:26] <z1haze> cool
[22:46:04] <aro> is there a way to restrict connectWith sortable lists to the ones they came from?
[23:02:43] <tash> I don't know whether to ask this here or in the php forum.  I'm not sure why, but I'm not getting the "confirm" dialog box, but the sql in the if statement is still being executed. http://pastebin.com/Y2K37dKL
[23:03:13] <tash> I don't want to execute the sql unless the user presses OK and confirms, but as I said, the confirm doesn't show up.  If I should ask in ##php that's fine, I will. Thought I'd try here first.
[23:04:32] <devslash> how do i set the selected value of an option dropdown using $(this)
[23:44:28] <chesty> hey, I'm looking for a way to set priority on a scale of 1 to 5, and display priority. jquery ui has a slidebar that might work, is there anything else you can think of that would suit setting/seeing priority better?
[23:45:55] <chesty> maybe a volume type scale, will try some google searches using volume
