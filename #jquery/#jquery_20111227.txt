[00:00:37] <dogarrhea2> guess it's a bug
[00:54:34] <GyroB> hi all
[00:55:11] <jstonne> hi
[01:15:33] <ssj> .
[02:37:46] <T-Co> Hey, does someone care to point me to a right direction with image preloading with deferreds? I want to preload and show images after doc ready and then when all images are done have a callback...
[02:37:50] <T-Co> I was drafting something like this: http://pastebin.com/d2zXa2sj
[02:37:54] <T-Co> But apparently I'm doing it wrong :)
[02:40:32] <T-Co> Oh, and $def.resolve(); of course
[02:45:48] <jstonne> T-Co: I can see that you are returning Deferred object within the $.map() function, basically, you're replacing the image element with the deferred element, which is wrong.
[02:46:23] <jstonne> Oh...
[02:48:02] <T-Co> ?
[02:48:54] <jstonne> Nothing. :-)
[02:49:49] <T-Co> I'm not sure if I'm using the deferred object correclty. Can someone verify?
[02:55:06] <jstonne> T-Co: It looks fine to me. resolve() the deferred object when the image is loadedâ€¦. and execute the callback when the deferred is resolved.
[02:59:03] <T-Co> jstonne, Yeah. However the done get's fired before the deferreds are resolved :(
[03:00:45] <mazzachre> I have this widget that creates a dialog and some other hidden stuff in the dom. Is it better to create one set of all this pr. widget or one for all of the widgets and update them on display?
[03:10:21] <jstonne> T-Co: I spot the issue. .apply(this, deferred);  the arguments are on the second param.
[03:13:27] <jstonne> mazzachre: It depends. If they are displayed one at a time you could reuse the same private widget. If not, then you're gonna have to clone() them and insert the contents and display.
[03:18:28] <mazzachre> jstonne: They won't be displayed at the same time... it is a modal dialog window, and the other stuff is auxiluries for that dialog...
[03:19:10] <mazzachre> On a side node, how do I make sure that my auxilury stuff is shown on top of the dialog? So far I have set the zindex to 10000 but I guess there is a better way?
[03:37:14] <lauxley> hi, how would i changed the displayed value of select to be the value attribute of the option, not the text node ?
[03:37:18] <lauxley> -d
[03:45:29] <sunscreen> .playlists ul::-webkit-scrollbar {
[03:45:29] <sunscreen> width: 8px;
[03:45:29] <sunscreen> }
[04:02:12] <T-Co> "Uncaught TypeError: Function.prototype.apply: Arguments list has wrong type"
[04:03:04] <Kit-10> Context pleas T-Co
[04:04:49] <T-Co> I was drafting something like this: http://pastebin.com/d2zXa2sj
[04:05:46] <T-Co> http://pastebin.com/qr1b3y7U fixed version
[04:06:12] <Arun_> hi there.. what is the difference between these two statements : element.click(); & element.trigger('click');
[04:06:36] <T-Co> So I'm trying to apply bunch of Deferred promise objects to jQuery.when
[04:07:32] <Kit-10> Arun_ yes the 1st has to check whether you've passed anything before calling hte 2nd
[04:08:00] <Andreas2k4> hey, i have a textarea with text selected by mouse, i couldnt find the apropriate jquery function to get just the selected text and not the entire text. is there one?
[04:08:02] <Arun_> sry, didn't get you.. could you elaborate please
[04:08:19] <Arun_> element.click(); & element.trigger('click'); difference between these two.. could you elaborate please
[04:08:31] <Kit-10> Arun_  .click takes in arguments, if none are passed it calls .trigger('click')
[04:09:19] <Kit-10> T-Co  the issue is the .apply
[04:09:34] <Kit-10> where are you getting that from?
[04:09:34] <T-Co> el.click() binds an click event to the element and el.trigger('click') triggers the bound event (click)
[04:09:50] <Kit-10> T-Co .click also triggers
[04:09:56] <T-Co> Kit-10, Modernizr has a similar thing with their test "framework"
[04:09:59] <Kit-10> but it has to do a check
[04:10:29] <Kit-10> T-Co the .when seems to be a function
[04:10:42] <Kit-10> when you use .apply on a function it does somethng different
[04:11:11] <Arun_> i mean, i have already bound an eventhandler function to 'click' event.. so now i use this statement : element.click(); it'll execute the eventhandler function
[04:11:15] <Arun_> but if i write instead element.trigger('click'); then, is there any difference between these above two statements ?
[04:11:23] <Kit-10> T-Co see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[04:11:41] <Kit-10> Arun_ YES there is a difference
[04:11:48] <Arun_> so, what is it ?
[04:12:00] <Kit-10> .click() checks for arguements, then calls .trigger('click') if finds none
[04:12:12] <Kit-10> .trigger('click') just does the triggering
[04:12:52] <Arun_> .click() checks for arguements, couldn't get this point :(
[04:13:00] <Kit-10> T-Co check to see if $.when is a function  because you might need $.when().apply
[04:13:19] <Kit-10> Arun_ do yo know what arguments are?
[04:13:32] <Arun_> yeah.. i know, arguments are passed to functions
[04:13:44] <Kit-10> ok so if nothing is passed to the click function
[04:13:52] <Kit-10> it means there are no arguments
[04:14:02] <Arun_> oh.. k, got it now =)
[04:14:03] <Kit-10> but it has to check that before calling .trigger
[04:14:13] <Arun_> was just a little puzzle.. Thank you ;)
[04:14:18] <Kit-10> :) no worries
[04:14:41] <delight> can someone tell me how i can receice the value of a certain inputvield in jquery ? the main problem for me is the css selector <input type="hidden" name="_token" value="abc123def456" />
[04:14:42] <delight> unfortunatly there is no id or class on the input field
[04:14:51] <delight> inputfield
[04:15:18] <Kit-10> $('input[name=_token]').val()
[04:15:30] <delight> Kit-10: thnx a lot
[04:17:31] <T-Co> Kit-10, Now I have this: http://pastebin.com/VjL4mcxs and still the done gets fired before deferreds are being resolved...
[04:17:56] <Kit-10> delight no worries, be careful with that though.. it's not the best selector in the world, if you can add an id added to the input it would make things a lot simpler
[04:18:57] <Kit-10> T-Co ok let me look, not completely au fait with deffereds
[04:19:08] <T-Co> Kit-10, Thanks
[04:19:15] <Arun_> Kit-10 can we write the above statement which you mentioned as $('input[name="_token"]').val() ?
[04:19:29] <Arun_> with quotes around the name attr
[04:20:01] <Kit-10> Arun_ no Don't add quotes
[04:20:11] <Arun_> oh... k
[04:20:14] <Kit-10> since it's not around hte name attribute
[04:20:18] <Kit-10> it's part of hte selector
[04:20:33] <Arun_> k, thnx
[04:20:46] <Kit-10> you could add them, but it's not required and causes more processing
[04:21:14] <Arun_> k, sure.. got it =)
[04:21:14] <Kit-10> T-Co let me look
[04:24:12] <T-Co> Kit-10, Yeah, for some reason the apply doesn't work...
[04:25:28] <Kit-10> are you applying to the returned deferred
[04:25:54] <Kit-10> sorry to the promise!
[04:26:10] <T-Co> Kit-10, For the array of deferred promise objects
[04:26:21] <T-Co> Kit-10, map returns an array
[04:26:49] <Kit-10> right.. i can see what you're trying to achieve
[04:27:02] * Kit-10 has done it without deferred/promise etc
[04:29:30] * Kit-10 is out of ideas T-Co as not done a lot of work with deferred/promises etc
[04:29:47] <T-Co> Darn
[04:29:56] <Kit-10> sorry
[04:30:11] <Kit-10> http://binarykitten.me.uk/dev/jq-plugins/107-jquery-image-preloader-plus-callbacks.html
[04:30:19] <Kit-10> thats how i did it without
[04:31:11] <Kit-10> though there's an issue with teh code display plugin
[04:31:28] <Kit-10> need to see why it's messing up like that
[04:32:55] <T-Co> Kit-10, Exactly why I wanted to use deferred objects... It's a bit harsh...
[04:33:11] <Kit-10> ? what's a bit harsh?
[04:33:12] <bot-t> Kit-10, .append() - Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[04:33:34] <T-Co> Kit-10, Using deferreds would be much simpler than your solution...
[04:33:44] <Kit-10> my solution is old
[04:34:16] <T-Co> Yeah, I understand that, do need to be offended ;)
[04:34:17] <Kit-10> as soon as i figure out deferreds properly i might update it
[04:34:27] <Kit-10> do need?
[04:34:31] <T-Co> s/do/no/
[04:34:45] <T-Co> Great typo :D
[04:35:21] <Kit-10> the example is multiple parts.. there is a CSS image preloader in there
[04:36:05] <Kit-10> but the principle still stands
[04:39:30] <Kit-10> T-Co taking a guess here..
[04:44:22] <Kit-10> taking a guess.. but the resolution is happening on 1 item.. you only want it to fire on all items ?
[04:46:32] <khmer_> heh, it's funny how the array-then-callback pattern in your solution sort of anticipated AMDs
[04:47:13] <Kit-10> AMDs?
[04:48:16] <khmer_> asynchronous module definition
[04:48:17] <khmer_> http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html
[04:48:38] <Kit-10> in who's solution anyway ... mine?
[04:48:43] <khmer_> if commonjs.org was working right now, i'd link you to the official doc!
[04:48:44] <khmer_> and, yes
[04:48:51] <khmer_> Kit-10: yours :)
[04:48:53] <Kit-10> heh
[04:49:14] * Kit-10 is using requireJS now for a project with certain things loaded
[04:49:27] <khmer_> so i'm sure you've seen the ghostly similarity
[04:49:39] <Kit-10> urm not really
[04:49:45] * khmer_ is building a RIA with require, backbone, jquery, underscore, omg, wtf
[04:49:47] <Kit-10> lol not looked at the preloader code for months
[04:49:59] <kkuno> hi
[04:50:11] * Kit-10 is not falling for that trap
[04:50:21] <kkuno> how can I check if an element is the first child of its parent?
[04:50:55] <Kit-10> $elem.is($elem.parent().children().first())
[04:50:57] <T-Co> Kit-10, When all items have finished (resolved) then done should be called
[04:51:34] <Kit-10> ok understood T-Co
[04:51:47] <kkuno> Kit-10, ok thx
[04:52:01] <khmer_> Kit-10: what, building a RIA with jquery as an ingredient?
[04:52:14] <Kit-10> T-Co the issue i get is that I'm not sure which item is triggering the resolution
[04:52:54] <Aldus> hello everyone. The change() event on a textfield occurs only when I click away from the textfield. How do I trigger it every time the text changes, even if changed by javascript?
[04:53:25] <Kit-10> are you sure you've hooked change?
[04:53:26] <mazzachre> Is there an idiom for singleton instantiation in jqueryui widget? Or do I do "the obvious" and put a data object on 'body' to store an "initialized" or somewhat to read and check against?
[04:53:36] <Kit-10> sounds like you've hooked blur Aldus
[04:54:46] <Aldus> Kit-10, http://pastebin.com/utnRML6F
[04:55:11] <Aldus> it's an autocomplete field from Drupal, I need to make a check every time an autocomplete value is picked
[04:56:17] <Kit-10> ah drupal.
[04:56:25] <khmer_> Aldus: that's expected behavior, actually, esp. in IE
[04:56:28] <Kit-10> let me guess drupal's 1.2.6 version?
[04:56:56] <khmer_> Aldus: the change event will fire when the value changes, but that's platform-dependent; in IE, the text field is a system control, so the DOM value is not really changing until the value is committed!
[04:57:04] <khmer_> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536912(v=vs.85).aspx <-- Aldus
[04:57:14] <Aldus> khmer_, sounds good, but it doesn't work on my Chrome under ubuntu :(
[04:57:34] <Aldus> Kit-10, Drupal has no 1.* version
[04:57:34] <khmer_> doubtless chrome implements it the same way
[04:57:39] <khmer_> FF is an outlier here
[04:57:39] <Aldus> D6 btw
[04:57:47] <Kit-10> Aldus what version of jquery?
[04:58:07] <Kit-10> when i looked they had a modified version of 1.2.6 in D6
[04:58:20] <Aldus> Kit-10, 1.3.2
[04:58:53] <Kit-10> is it local or CDN
[04:58:56] <Aldus> local
[04:59:07] <Kit-10> check for modificaton..
[04:59:38] <Kit-10> again what khmer_ said makes sense
[04:59:41] <Aldus> btw seems like it works this way as designed...
[04:59:46] <khmer_> Aldus: suggestion: if you absolutely NEED to be monitoring the text field value every second, you'll have to do a setInterval, or my recommendation, a recursive setTimeout
[05:00:03] <Kit-10> or monitor the keyup
[05:00:17] <khmer_> unfortunately that won't work on a mouse-initiated paste
[05:00:21] <khmer_> which he did explicitly mention
[05:00:34] <Kit-10> true true, but just block the context menu :p
[05:00:45] <Aldus> khmer_, the problem is that the autocomplete returns a title and a key, which would be displayed both on the textfield, and I would like to instantly take out the key and put it in another (hidden) field for not creating confusion to the end user
[05:00:51] <khmer_> Kit-10: step into my office
[05:01:35] * Kit-10 kicks the door down
[05:01:46] <khmer_> Aldus: wait, so you want to do something when an autocomplete widget has returned results?
[05:01:56] <khmer_> Kit-10: you're fired for trying to block OS functionality
[05:02:17] <khmer_> Kit-10: i'd order you to fix my door but i have an open-door policy
[05:02:21] <Aldus> after i click one of the autocomplete's results, it populates its textfield. I want to do stuff immediately after this is done
[05:02:32] <khmer_> Aldus: is this a jquery ui autocomplete?
[05:02:56] <Aldus> khmer_, i think it's not, it's built-in autocomplete of drupal
[05:03:14] <Aldus> but may be pretty close or identical to the jquery_ui one
[05:03:26] <khmer_> Aldus: does it have an autocompletechange event?
[05:03:43] <khmer_> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#event-change <-- Aldus
[05:03:44] <khmer_> ;-)
[05:04:00] <Aldus> no idea :| let me check
[05:06:46] <Aldus> seems like works are in progress.. http://drupal.org/node/675446
[05:07:00] <Aldus> we have some autocomplete event, but they are not the same
[05:08:34] <khmer_> sound like you'll either have to set that setTimeout, modify the widget
[05:08:42] <khmer_> or use a different widget type
[05:10:56] <Aldus> khmer_, seems like I found a trick that does it
[05:11:09] <Aldus> $('#edit-emp-lname').change(function() { doChange(); }).attr("onchange", function() { doChange(); }).blur( function() { doChange(); });
[05:32:55] <Guest11018> Does anybody know how to change an element's :hover css, using the .css() method? (And not the .hover())
[05:34:29] <daGrevis> Any way to determine on what line event for clicking on some node is written?
[05:34:46] <daGrevis> like when I click <div id="x" /> something happens
[05:34:53] <daGrevis> but I dont know where is that .click
[05:34:55] <daGrevis> shit :D
[05:35:28] <Guest11018> Doesn't that div has an ID? to do ("#x").click()?
[05:35:49] <Guest11018> $("#").click() ...that is
[05:36:08] <sadmicrowave> bot-t, tell kborchers whats up
[05:36:08] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, Okay.
[05:36:47] <daGrevis> Guest11018, it was just an example. i dont know is it selected by class, id or some other hierarchy
[05:36:56] <sadmicrowave> $(#me).owns('world')
[05:38:05] <Guest11018> It doesn't have an ID or Class at  all? Is it a member of a parent element with ID or Class?
[05:40:19] * Guest11018 still wondering if there is a way to use pseudo selectors with .css() method...
[05:40:20] <sadmicrowave> daGrevis, put an alert inside the .click() event you think it is and continue adding the alert to other .click events until you find the one that triggers
[05:40:25] <daGrevis> Guest11018, it has ID, it has class. I has parents with IDs and classes. I just dont know by what its asigned. like by ID or by class or what?
[05:40:35] <daGrevis> i could get that node and by using this
[05:40:45] <daGrevis> determine, SOMEHOW, what other events are assigned to it
[05:41:01] <daGrevis> sadmicrowave, yee. thats the old-school way :(
[05:41:15] <sadmicrowave> lol old-school == tried and true
[05:41:20] <daGrevis> works but sux
[05:41:25] <daGrevis> there must be a better way
[05:41:30] <sadmicrowave> not to my knowledge
[05:41:37] <daGrevis> too bad for both of us
[05:41:46] <sadmicrowave> is it triggering an error?
[05:41:50] <daGrevis> na
[05:42:18] <sadmicrowave> oh then nevermind, if it was, then pop it into FF and check the error console which will give you line#
[05:42:29] <sadmicrowave> then*
[05:42:41] <daGrevis> ff console sux as well :D
[05:42:45] <daGrevis> try chrome's one
[05:42:45] <sadmicrowave> oh crap, -then
[05:42:50] <daGrevis> dont be sad :(
[05:42:56] <daGrevis> be just microwave
[05:42:59] <sadmicrowave> you are making me sad
[05:43:09] <sadmicrowave> stop being difficult
[05:43:10] <daGrevis> drink coke
[05:43:17] <daGrevis> (:
[05:43:58] <sadmicrowave> Guest11018, did you get your problem figured out?
[05:44:30] <Guest11018> Nope!
[05:44:46] <sadmicrowave> is it a div with no class or id defined in the tag?
[05:44:55] <Guest11018> I searched and it seems there is no straight way to do that. Only small hacks.
[05:45:46] <sadmicrowave> Guest11018, maybe paste your html somewhere
[05:46:03] <sadmicrowave> just the portion you are trying to act upon (including the parent)
[05:46:21] * Guest11018 (Shares his tip on debugging: I just put a div with id#debug and send all debug logging there, instead of sending them to the console or alert)
[05:47:15] <Guest11018> @sadmicroware: the div has a css: #box: hover { ... }
[05:47:34] <sadmicrowave> so the div ID is #box
[05:47:53] <Guest11018> I want to change that with something like $("#box").css(":hover", "...");
[05:48:12] <sadmicrowave> when hovered upon?
[05:48:17] <sadmicrowave> or clicked...or what?
[05:48:30] <Guest11018> @sadmicrowave: It's a hover css so when hovered...
[05:48:57] <Guest11018> Server: irc.freenode.net
[05:50:16] <Guest11018> I am dynamically changing a menu buttons images to another language. So when "it" is clicked all of the buttons backgroundImage are changed to Italian version. But what about the :hover css attribute? I can not change that with .csS().
[05:50:38] <Guest11018> "it" is a button that changes the language...
[05:52:21] <sadmicrowave> and whats wrong with .hover()?
[05:52:35] <Guest11018> I might be missing something here, but the jQuery API does not seem to have a css :pseudo selector support...
[05:52:56] <Guest11018> Just making the code a little bit better and easier...
[05:53:15] <Guest11018> Just wanted to check if there is an alternative to that...
[05:53:50] <Lobosque> Hello guys. Please take a look here: http://pastebin.com/urZ7XQth  I think what I'm trying to do is pretty straightforward, but it does not work. what I'm doing wrong?
[05:54:45] <Guest11018> Have you tried .hover(in, out)?
[05:56:48] <Lobosque> I tried, but looks like in already exists or is a reserved word
[05:56:57] <Lobosque> with other name it works =]
[05:57:02] <sadmicrowave> Guest11018, I'm not seeing an alternative man
[05:58:12] <sadmicrowave> Lobosque, why does it have to be named in() and out()? change it to hoverIn() and hoverOut()
[05:59:39] <Moshe> Hi, I'm having trouble with the patch for bug #5280 for jQuery UI, is someone here who was involved with it? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5280
[06:00:39] <Eviltwin> Moshe: I suggest checking #jqueryui-dev
[06:00:47] <Moshe> Eviltwin: ok, thanks
[06:01:10] <Moshe> The contact page for jquery ui tells me to go here
[06:01:27] <kkuno> I want to add parameters to the callback function of show:
[06:01:38] <kkuno> el.show(speed,function(){})
[06:01:51] <kkuno> what can I do?
[06:02:17] <Eviltwin> Moshe: You can come here for getting questions like "How do I do X?" etc answered
[06:02:35] <Eviltwin> Moshe: But if you're questions are about development of jQuery/jQuery UI, that's what the dev channels are for
[06:02:50] <Eviltwin> kkuno: What kind of parameters?
[06:03:02] <Eviltwin> And why can't you use closure?
[06:04:05] <sadmicrowave> Lobosque, http://jsfiddle.net/6YLp3/
[06:04:32] <kkuno> Eviltwin, i want to pass a simple integer
[06:04:35] <kkuno> or boolean
[06:04:40] <kkuno> what is closure?
[06:05:06] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave, Lobosque: http://jsfiddle.net/6YLp3/1/
[06:05:39] <sadmicrowave> that will work too :p
[06:05:50] <Lobosque> thanks guys

[06:07:57] <Peter__> sadly.. this won't work
[06:08:01] <Peter__> any ideas?
[06:08:02] <Eviltwin> Peter__: see ?.html or see ?.text
[06:08:07] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[06:08:11] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/html/
[06:08:15] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/text/
[06:08:15] <Peter__> .text didn't work either
[06:08:33] <Peter__> as did .html
[06:08:44] <sadmicrowave> Peter__, you can't use javascript and jquery like that
[06:08:58] <sadmicrowave> document.getElementById('footer').innerHTML = 'text';
[06:09:11] <sadmicrowave> or $('#footer').text( 'text' );
[06:09:15] <kkuno> Eviltwin, yeah but it doesn't work in my case, because I have many elements that animate at the same time
[06:09:26] <kkuno> uhm no
[06:09:27] <kkuno> wait
[06:09:29] <kkuno> you're correct
[06:09:45] <Peter__> uhh.. silly mistake -.-
[06:09:53] <Peter__> thanks sadmicrowave
[06:09:57] <sadmicrowave> np
[06:10:11] <Eviltwin> kkuno: I usually am
[06:10:41] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: Or $("#footer")[0].innerHTML
[06:11:15] <sadmicrowave> right but the [0] 'converts' it back to javascript format so innerHTML works
[06:11:27] <sadmicrowave> if you want to call it 'converting'
[06:11:38] <Eviltwin> I'd rather you didn't
[06:11:40] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:11:48] <Eviltwin> Since there's no converting happening
[06:12:17] <mazzachre> Is there an accepted way of handling singletons in jqueryui widget (or jquery)? I am making a widget that have it's own dialog. And I would like to just make one dialog and set some data for it when it is shown (it is modal)...
[06:12:57] <Eviltwin> mazzachre: Create it in the constructor, store it in "this" and then use it when it comes up
[06:13:02] <mazzachre> Currently I am considering adding a data field to 'body' (or 'html'??) and check in _create if that data element is actually there or not, and skip that part of the initialization if it is there...
[06:13:22] <Eviltwin> You mean every instance of the widget shares one?
[06:13:27] <mazzachre> Eviltwin: Yes
[06:14:00] <held> hey guys how do i access the form of the selector that was clicked? the selector has an id #filter but the form doesn't have one
[06:14:13] <held> i guess there's some way to find the parent form or something right?
[06:14:30] <mazzachre> held: $(this).parentUntil('form') or somewhat...
[06:14:51] <held> mazzachre: thanks i'll try that
[06:14:55] <mazzachre> held: No, use closets
[06:15:00] <mazzachre> closest
[06:15:02] <mazzachre> even
[06:15:09] <RLa> mazzachre, is that sharing good idea at all?
[06:15:26] <mazzachre> held $(this).closest('form'); in event handler
[06:16:05] <Eviltwin> mazzachre: I would suggest something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/UjVqP/
[06:16:14] <mazzachre> RLa: I don't know... It is an options dialog... I will, on show, set all values to what is currently selected in the formated input field that the widget hides
[06:16:40] <Eviltwin> If you want to use the singleton approach
[06:17:33] <RLa> i would avoid sharing, and create some highly usable helper function/prototype for constructing it when needed
[06:18:49] <RLa> with sharing you would have to clear old values in the dialog, won't you?
[06:22:24] <mazzachre> RLa: Yes, but that would be done anyways. Since the dialog reflects an input field (which I hide) I am not sure if I should force the value I thought was in it, or if I should take the value actually in it every time the dialog is shown...
[06:23:23] <RLa> I should take the value actually in it every time the dialog is shown <- that sounds most sensible
[06:23:36] <mazzachre> For my own page, I could ofcause decided that only the widget changes the value, and then go with that, but since it is an input field in the background, I might want to change the value with .val('something formated'); and then see that value when user next opens the widget
[06:24:13] <mazzachre> On the other hand, the widget would not by itself update the value in the placeholder button I set for it in the first place... So perhaps I need to make it do that...
[06:24:35] <mazzachre> Eviltwin: Thx, that is what I was looking for :)

[06:34:22] <jita> One success of this function i want to reload the content of some division, how should i do that? http://dpaste.org/Ww1nt/
[06:35:00] <Eviltwin> Depends on what you want to load it with
[06:39:33] <jita> Eviltwin, just want to refresh it, not load it with anything
[06:39:58] <Eviltwin> $("#foobar").load("/this/page #foobar")
[06:40:06] <Eviltwin> See http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:42:23] <jita> Eviltwin, i cant do that using http://dpaste.org/Ww1nt/
[06:42:57] <jita> Eviltwin, so when the function is executed successfully, the division shouled be reloaded, can you have a look at the code please ?
[06:42:58] <Eviltwin> Then do it a different way
[06:43:13] <Eviltwin> If you refuse to do it my way
[06:44:15] <Eviltwin> You realize that this code is almost useless to me, right?
[06:46:53] <jita> Eviltwin, Sorry i am new. Actually GET url request makes changes to database but does not return anything, so i have to refresh the division in order to reflect the database changes
[06:47:15] <Eviltwin> So I want you to read http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:47:31] <Eviltwin> And understand what $("#foobar").load("/this/page #foobar") does
[06:47:47] <Eviltwin> And then understand why that should go inside the success
[06:50:02] <joikus> just an FYI, for those who decided to use css3pie for IE7, rounded corners behave oddly on IE7 under IE9's compatibility mode, but in fact works FINE on a real IE7 - so you don't waste hours and hours like I did :P
[06:50:04] <Moshe> Eviltwin: Not much going on in #jqueryui-dev, I submitted a bug report for the problem: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7972
[06:57:16] <jita> Eviltwin, the url in load should return the full page ?
[06:58:05] <abstrusenick> why event delegation doesn't work on iOS?
[07:00:35] <Tomashe> hey guys
[07:01:03] <Tomashe> how do i find image after specific image? i was trying that with no use :/ var n = $(".thumb").find("img").before("img[src='"+src+"']");
[07:04:42] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/before/
[07:05:09] <Eviltwin> You probably want to use nextAll and first
[07:05:45] <Tomashe> hmm
[07:18:26] <whateverb> why doesn't $(window).trigger("resize");   trigger automatically: $(window).resize(function() { // Do something });
[07:24:47] <hashpuppy> i have $(":button").button(); which fails if there is no button.  Is there some method that will only try that if the button exists?  Is that what live is?  Or is that not effecient and I should just test for $(":button") first
[07:26:46] <whateverb> if ($(":button").length ){ $(":button").button(); }  ?
[07:29:55] <Eviltwin> whateverb: http://jsfiddle.net/DRdH8/
[07:32:18] <whateverb> thanks, Eviltwin...I had wrong sequence  and tried triggering first than resize func itself :)
[07:34:27] <hashpuppy> whateverb: yeah, i couldn't find anything that already existed in the library that was better than that
[07:34:48] <hashpuppy> only thing i could come up with was creating my own function for what you've defined
[07:34:49] <hashpuppy> onExists($(":button"), function(o) { o.button(); });
[07:39:49] <Eviltwin> Huh, jQuery was designed around operating on empty collections just fine
[07:40:05] <Eviltwin> And just not doing anything
[07:44:28] <opius> how can i load data from an external site using .load? (in iframe first?)
[07:44:47] <Pilate> create an iframe element, load into it?
[07:45:46] <opius> yeah, that's what i thought.. but can i then "load" the data to format and manipulate ?
[07:46:29] <Lobosque> is there a jquery animation for css3 rotate? for example, rotate 90 degrees in 800 miliseconds
[07:56:12] <Eviltwin> Lobosque: jQuery can animate any numberic CSS property
[07:56:33] <Eviltwin> But that doesn't necessarily mean every browser supports that property
[07:58:06] <Lobosque> Eviltwin can you give me an example with rotate? how can I animate transform: rotate(45deg); ?
[07:59:14] <asterisk-Tester> hey, is there an easy way to validate an input of type text, to allow only chars and numbers : abcde...z12345 ... including spaces and excluding special chars such as !@#$%^&*() [],./;' ....
[07:59:38] <Eviltwin> Lobosque: If you're using CSS3, why aren't you using CSS3 animations?
[08:00:43] <Eviltwin> asterisk-Tester: input.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+$/)
[08:02:53] <Lobosque> Eviltwin rotate is well supported in all major browsers. is it possible to use jquery animate() with transform: rotate(45deg)?
[08:03:18] <Eviltwin> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3789984/jquery-how-do-i-animate-a-div-rotation
[08:04:10] <Lobosque> thank you
[08:05:36] <sphinxxx> lobosque, you can combine css3 and jquery, have a class that does the rotation, and assign css transitions to that class, then you can trigger it by adding the class to your element via jquery
[08:06:56] <kaeferli> hi guys, i need some help....im trying to catch with an if-statement whether $(this) has a bigger 'width' or a var-jquery-object (if ($(this).css('width') > var.css('width')) { do_this } else { do_that }  .... unfortunately it sometimes works (for some vars) and sometimes not (for other vars) .... the vars are correct and if i alert the var.css('width') i get the right alert-box. any help? i.e.: i want to prohibit the bigger divs to be placed
[08:06:56] <kaeferli> the smaller test-file: http://arthoria-plus.bplaced.net/test/hanoi/tuerme.html - thanks
[08:11:40] <asterisk-Tester> Eviltwin: Should it be smthg like this ?  http://pastebin.com/J0jcbPmr
[08:11:55] <Eviltwin> kaeferli: Use .width() instead
[08:12:09] <Eviltwin> asterisk-Tester: Sure
[08:12:15] <Eviltwin> Err
[08:12:20] <Eviltwin> $('#myInput').val().match
[08:13:14] <kaeferli> Eviltwin: thx..now working...are there bugs in the css-width or wheres my problem?
[08:15:20] <asterisk-Tester> Eviltwin: ok thx, worked great !
[08:15:47] <Eviltwin> kaeferli: .css("width") returns a string
[08:16:07] <Eviltwin> And "150px" < "50px" because 1 comes before 5 in lexographic order
[08:16:35] <kaeferli> Eviltwin: oh..thx .. width() obviously then returns an integer
[08:16:44] <Eviltwin> Yes
[08:18:17] <ramkam001> Hello !
[08:20:41] <ramkam001> I am looking for a slider plugin that allows to update the list of images that are shown (a large collection of image, i want to preload only a few at a time). Any recommendations ?
[08:21:09] <Eviltwin> A slider?
[08:21:20] <Eviltwin> This is a slider: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[08:21:49] <ramkam001> can i change the list of images without wrecking havoc ?
[08:22:11] <Eviltwin> Um...probably?
[08:22:16] <Eviltwin> You're not being very specific
[08:23:12] <ramkam001> An images showcase. I have 10k+ previews i want to go through. Cant load them all at a time ...
[08:23:45] <ramkam001> Ideally i'd be able to bind touchStart / touchEnd events
[08:23:58] <sonotos> http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic/
[08:24:34] <ramkam001> i want to have n images loaded at a time, (say i am at image 103, i'd preload, 100 to 102, show 103, and preload 104 to 106)
[08:24:36] <sonotos> you can trigger the events by slider
[08:26:15] <ramkam001> Interestings, that looks like it
[08:26:37] <ramkam001> Do you know if it supports doing the same but with div elements ?
[08:26:44] <ramkam001> (the thumbnail pages :-) )
[08:27:07] <ramkam001> (i'd have 2 layers, one for the previews, one for the thumbnails)
[08:29:43] <sonotos> like http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic/example-5.html
[08:30:25] <sonotos> well there are a bunch of events you can use for customizing the behaviour, also number of images in prefetching etc.
[08:31:39] <ramkam001> yep, looks well done, thanks i'll give it a try
[08:32:47] <ramkam001> thanks, there's so many plugins out the we ne ver know which one is good
[08:50:19] <DashNY> I have a <div id="d1"> ... </div> with other divs inside of it. How would I insert another <div> into d1 as the first element (e.g. before other inner divs)?
[08:56:31] <Eviltwin> DashNY: Take a look at the :first-child selector and http://api.jquery.com/before/
[08:57:21] <instanceoftom> using jquery modal dialogs, is it possible to add content to the semi-transparent background div?
[08:57:56] <Eviltwin> What kind of content
[08:58:14] <instanceoftom> additional divs
[08:58:33] <RLa> can't you just add another layer on top of it
[08:58:35] <Eviltwin> For the purposes of showing...
[08:58:52] <RLa> as it's usually done with those overlays
[09:00:36] <instanceoftom> actually probably better to ask it this way: i am trying to do something similar to google+ image gallery, when you click a photo the photo comes up in a modal like window, but the background gets a set of buttons and controls. Would using the modal features of jquery-ui make sense here?
[09:02:13] <Eviltwin> The background gets it?
[09:02:26] <Eviltwin> Can you make an HTML/CSS example of the look you're going for at jsFiddle.net?
[09:03:09] <instanceoftom> sorry, better to say the modal layer which hides the page content gets some controls
[09:05:15] <instanceoftom> yeah ill see if i can get a jsfiddle up, might solve the problem in the process
[09:06:21] <Eviltwin> I'm just asking for appearance-wise what you're trying to achieve
[09:06:32] <jita> Any idea why this is not working? http://dpaste.org/ZehXQ/
[09:06:34] <instanceoftom> do you have google plus?
[09:06:36] <Eviltwin> Not necessarily the JS to trigger it
[09:06:52] <Eviltwin> I do but I don't understand what you mean about the buttons being "in" the background
[09:07:11] <instanceoftom> i phrased that poorly
[09:07:17] <Eviltwin> jita: 401 means Not Authorized
[09:07:50] <jita> Eviltwin, In my app, it just redirects to login page hence the 302
[09:07:50] <Eviltwin> 302 means Found and is a form of success that is indistunguishable from 200 in most contexts
[09:08:16] <Eviltwin> When an XHR hits a 302, if the destination doesn't violate SOP, it makes the next request and so on
[09:08:46] <jita> Eviltwin, so statusCode doesnt work in this case ?
[09:09:28] <jita> Eviltwin, isnt there any solution for this ?
[09:09:52] <Eviltwin> http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#infrastructure-for-the-send-method
[09:10:47] <Eviltwin> All of the redirects are transparently followed as long as they are SOP
[09:10:58] <Eviltwin> And if they're aren't SOP, it's a network error
[09:11:12] <Eviltwin> You either need to be able to recognize the actual login page
[09:11:20] <Eviltwin> Or have a different result returned
[09:12:15] <Eviltwin> XHR != cURL
[09:41:48] <hellais> some of you may be interested in: http://hellais.wordpress.com/2011/12/27/how-to-improve-javascript-cryptography/
[09:43:06] <Eviltwin> JavaScript's not particularly ideal for cryptography
[09:50:44] <hellais> Eviltwin: yes, but it is something that is important, that a lot of people would benfit from
[10:04:47] <iman> hi, how can I change css property in jquery, for example change height: 20px to height: 40px, is there any way except removeClass and addClass ?
[10:06:13] <sphinxxx> iman, .css
[10:06:28] <sphinxxx> .css('height','40px')
[10:07:50] <Woet> they should name those functions better
[10:07:50] <iman> sphinxxx, thanks a lot, it works correctly
[10:07:55] <Woet> who would think to use .css to change css
[10:08:10] <Woet> and they should create documentation or something
[10:08:17] <Woet> so people don't have to run to IRC and ask their question straight away
[10:09:23] <Tyler__> Woet: seriously, their docs and examples are the WORST
[10:10:43] <Woet> and maybe they should create some site
[10:10:46] <Woet> that searches the internet or something
[10:10:51] <Woet> so you can enter "jquery change css"
[10:10:58] <Woet> and you get some results
[10:11:06] <Woet> oh well, maybe in a few years
[10:11:12] <Tyler__> that's ridiculous, it's such a broad and vague term
[10:11:19] <Tyler__> it could mean anything
[10:12:11] <Tyler__> even if it was possibly, it could bring up dozens of sites all with different variations and examples to accomplish the same thing.
[10:12:23] <Tyler__> how would you know who was right?
[10:19:03] <barraponto> js hackers, is it possible to set tab status to loading?
[10:19:27] <barraponto> i'd like to have the loading indicator on the tab while an ajax is loading
[10:19:41] <barraponto> or while something is being processed.
[10:19:54] <BrotherRodriguez> document.title
[10:20:13] <BrotherRodriguez> change the property for while your ajax is loading
[10:20:28] <BrotherRodriguez> you could store the previous title in a variable and restore it when the ajax request is complete
[10:20:58] <BrotherRodriguez> $(document).attr("title", "New Title");
[10:21:04] <BrotherRodriguez> would be better, I suppose
[10:29:22] <t4nkd> Is the best way to get a sibling inside a function for another element to use $(this + "sibling"); ?
[10:29:38] <t4nkd> or, "+ sibling" I guess it would be
[10:30:27] <bot-t> t4nkd, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
[10:30:54] <t4nkd> ah yes, that's the best way to describe what I want, use an element reference as the context for a search
[10:31:28] <Eviltwin> Who triggered that bot-t?
[10:31:35] <t4nkd> Someone epic
[10:31:45] <Eviltwin> Is there a command for that response?
[10:31:56] <Eviltwin> I see a lot of people trying to do that
[10:31:56] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: concatobj :;)
[10:32:03] <Eviltwin> K
[10:32:12] <t4nkd> I'm actually a little creepyed out, I'll be honest, but thanks for helping :D
[10:37:46] <barraponto> BrotherRodriguez: i actually wanted the loading icon firefox and chrome displays when a document is loading, do you know what i mean?
[10:38:07] <barraponto> BrotherRodriguez: of course setting the favicon and tab title would work as well.
[10:38:55] <BrotherRodriguez> barraponto: I mis-read then. My guess would be to set the favicon.
[10:39:57] <BrotherRodriguez> favicon is cached, though, so it might not work well
[10:41:41] <barraponto> BrotherRodriguez: there is no native way to set window status to loading, then? chucks.
[10:42:37] <BrotherRodriguez> barraponto: not that I know of.
[10:42:55] <barraponto> BrotherRodriguez: thanks :) i'll se what i can do from favicons.

[11:02:55] <Ortund> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/yE4yQ/9/ it didn't work
[11:03:18] <Eviltwin> Ortund: See my previous message
[11:03:55] <Ortund> each on the left column or the right column?
[11:04:58] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/yE4yQ/11/        <<< that didn't help anything
[11:05:24] <Eviltwin> You know that just makes it run the exact same thing twice instead, right?
[11:05:29] <Eviltwin> Ortund: see ?.each
[11:05:30] <bot-t> Ortund, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[11:05:46] <Eviltwin> Hint: There will be a "this" involved
[11:06:32] <Ortund> remind me, which function is used to find the nearest iteration of an element? Is it find()?
[11:06:44] <Eviltwin> "iteration"?
[11:07:02] <Eviltwin> I think you're talking about next/nextAll
[11:07:29] <Ortund> I'm thinking that for each div.message, I want to find the closest div.author to it
[11:07:43] <Ortund> I think that would work
[11:08:38] <Eviltwin> This also feels very tabley
[11:09:11] <Eviltwin> You shouldn't use JavaScript to solve a problem HTML already does
[11:09:21] <Eviltwin> That's what CSS is for :P
[11:10:12] <melii> hi
[11:14:32] <melii> i have a memberlist on my site. every action opens a jquery dialog where users can be create, delete or update. the problem is, when the dialog clos after action the content is still the same like before
[11:14:50] <melii> how can i update the specific content?
[11:17:36] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ melii
[11:17:37] <bot-t> melii, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[11:17:44] <blueadept> would anyone might know why if javascript might be failing to init a click event after a mustache.js template has loaded data on to the screen?
[11:17:53] <blueadept> same html, markup, but after mustache.js loads the new data, jquery events no longer work
[11:18:16] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ blueadept
[11:18:16] <bot-t> blueadept, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[11:18:48] <blueadept> ah cool
[11:21:04] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/yE4yQ/13/         <<< It still doesn't work ... Eviltwin, how is there a css solution for this?
[11:21:44] <melii> http://jsfiddle.net/gndVN/ here is my code
[11:23:47] <Ortund> yes, melii, and?
[11:23:55] <Eviltwin> Ortund: And not everyone is here to help you
[11:24:38] <Eviltwin> melii: jsFiddle doesn't do PHP can you maybe copy from the View Source of your browser instead of pasting your PHP source?
[11:24:42] <Eviltwin> So we can see what actually goes there
[11:25:02] <sunscreen> muhaha
[11:25:11] <sunscreen> i nicked youtubes blue button
[11:25:29] <Eviltwin> I also don't understand why you're making a brand new iframe into a dialog
[11:25:36] <Eviltwin> And not adding it to the DOM
[11:25:36] <Ortund> Eviltwin I never said everyone was here to help me... melii pasted code and never said what was wrong with it
[11:25:43] <melii> i have a memberlist on my site. every action opens a jquery dialog where users can be create, delete or update. the problem is, when the dialog close after action the content is still the same like before
[11:25:49] <Eviltwin> Ortund: He did up above
[11:26:17] <Ortund> So I don't read the screen all the time, there's no need for you to get shitty about it
[11:26:34] <sunscreen> i swear youtube learned how to use multiple css class's
[11:27:14] <melii> Eviltwin, waht u mean with brand new?
[11:27:35] <Eviltwin> melii: $('<iframe src = "' + site + '">') constructs a new iframe
[11:27:52] <melii> u have a better solution?
[11:27:56] <Woet> IFRAME IFRAME IFRAME?
[11:28:02] <Eviltwin> Reuse an existing iframe?
[11:28:06] <Woet> did someone travel me back in time in my sleep?
[11:28:09] <sunscreen> hah
[11:28:19] <melii> i donÂ´t know how to do this
[11:28:49] <Eviltwin> melii: So these are actually showing up?
[11:28:52] <Eviltwin> These frames?
[11:28:59] <melii> yes
[11:29:00] <Woet> why are you using an iframe melii?
[11:29:35] <Eviltwin> Which content is not changing? The stuff inside the dialog or outside?
[11:30:22] <melii> because the sites exists and i didnÂ´t knew a better solution first. i know itsnot perfect
[11:30:29] <melii> outside
[11:30:33] <Woet> "the site exists"
[11:30:34] <Woet> what?
[11:31:13] <melii> sry my english is very bad
[11:31:17] <Eviltwin> melii: What's the purpose of the $('.iframe[href$=1]')?
[11:31:31] <Woet> melii: no, i wasn't talking about your English
[11:31:33] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to select?
[11:31:39] <Woet> melii: WHY are you using iframes?
[11:31:59] <Eviltwin> Woet: There are still many usecases for iframes
[11:32:16] <Eviltwin> Usually with pre-built stuff
[11:32:16] <Woet> Eviltwin: correct, and I'm very sorry melii's use case isn't one.
[11:32:18] <Eviltwin> But also for sandboxing
[11:32:21] <Woet> -sorry +sure
[11:32:22] <shesek> why not $('<iframe>').attr({src: site}) instead?
[11:32:50] <Eviltwin> Actually $("<iframe>",{src:site}) works too
[11:33:01] <melii> i select the content to change userinformation or delete a user
[11:33:18] <Eviltwin> melii: Is $('.iframe[href$=1]') supposed to refer to the same thing they clicked to trigger this?
[11:33:29] <melii> something like change user/id/22
[11:34:08] <Woet> okay, you all have fun using iframes where it's absolutely not necessary and working around their issues
[11:34:17] * Woet goes back to the year 2011
[11:34:35] <melii> no the refer goes only to the site who it shows up me a userform to edit the user
[11:35:03] <Eviltwin> Woet: While we try to encourage good practices, when people come here with specific questions, we don't generally force them to uproot their design before helping them
[11:35:23] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: you should save that into a bot-t :D
[11:35:32] <Eviltwin> Heh, yeah
[11:35:38] <Woet> Eviltwin: i thought the general consensus was that people ask what they are trying to do, so we can give them the proper and right solution
[11:35:44] <melii> ok so u mean i should do that without an iframe?
[11:35:50] <Woet> rather than just believing that the way they are solving it is the correct one
[11:36:02] <Eviltwin> Woet: So give him a solution or let him keep doing what he's doing
[11:36:14] <Woet> Eviltwin: or ask him what he's TRYING to do, so we can give the right solution
[11:36:27] <Woet> he is trying to solve X by asking how to do Y
[11:36:35] <Woet> if he just asks how to do X, the world would be a better place.
[11:37:04] <melii> maybe u can show me an example for a better solution?
[11:37:46] <Woet> melii: you would get the content using ajax, then put it in the dialog
[11:37:57] <Woet> melii: and then post the data using ajax when someone clicks 'OK' in the dialog
[11:38:52] <melii> allright but how can i  realize that the site behind the dialog get update?
[11:39:11] <melii> i mean thats not the problem by the iframe i think
[11:39:14] <Woet> melii: the site behind the dialog?
[11:39:39] <Woet> melii: you mean, how does the dialog know when to close?
[11:40:03] <Eviltwin> ?helping
[11:40:04] <bot-t> While we try to encourage good practices, when people come here with specific questions, we don't generally force them to uproot their design before helping them
[11:40:06] <Eviltwin> :D
[11:40:15] <melii> yes it shows me a userlist, i click edit by user 123, it shows me the editform from user 123 in a dialog, i edit them...click ok and than the dialog close
[11:40:31] <Woet> melii: okay, then use ajax to get the editform and use ajax to post the editform
[11:40:42] <Woet> ?ask
[11:40:42] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:40:49] <Woet> http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:40:50] <melii> ok thanks guys
[11:40:56] <Woet> "Describe the goal, not the step"
[11:41:08] <Woet> Often, people who need technical help have a high-level goal in mind and get stuck on what they think is one particular path towards the goal. They come for help with the step, but don't realize that the path is wrong. It can take substantial effort to get past this.
[11:41:32] <ajpiano> Woet: there's a balance
[11:41:39] <Eviltwin> If the step is step 12 of 14 of a design that will work but maybe's not ideal,
[11:41:48] <Eviltwin> I'm going to help them with step 12
[11:42:20] <ajpiano> sometimes the person is working on a project that has been around for awhile on a team with other people -- "just rewrite it completely diferently' isn't a viable solution sometimes
[11:42:42] <ajpiano> however in this case it probably is possible to avoid an iframe :p
[11:42:42] <Woet> then they can state so :)
[11:42:51] <ajpiano> but i haven't been paying that much attention so i don't know
[11:43:06] <Woet> if they know what they are doing and know what they are doing is bad, they will tell so
[11:43:59] <sunscreen> holy cow
[11:44:03] <Eviltwin> ?iframe
[11:44:03] <bot-t> "iframe: Avoid, if at all possible"
[11:44:09] <sunscreen> <button> is awesome
[11:44:14] <sunscreen> its like a macro
[11:44:27] <sunscreen> for span and img
[11:45:10] <Eviltwin> If I could make two changes to jsFiddle (or at least the version we refer here)
[11:45:23] <Eviltwin> It would be to automatically select jQuery instead of MooTools
[11:45:27] <necromanger> hey there
[11:45:33] <Eviltwin> And to force the saved code to be tidied up
[11:45:36] <Eviltwin> HTML and CSS as well
[11:45:56] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: they're mootools guys :p - but it would be nice if they localstorage'd or cookie'd etc the user's preference
[11:46:08] <sunscreen> yeah it should remember which one you used last with a cookie or something
[11:46:21] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: I'd like to see a query param or hash so we can refer people with it
[11:46:47] <necromanger> having a prob with jquery if anyone could help me out in clarify some stuff
[11:46:49] <riyonuk> I set a div to have a top of, whatever the height of the div is above it. It works fine. When I increase the font, the div expands, and I would expect to other div to expand as well (cause its doing calculations). Why isn't it? :/
[11:46:53] <necromanger> i would be apreciated
[11:46:58] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ necromanger
[11:46:58] <bot-t> necromanger, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:47:23] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ riyonuk
[11:47:24] <bot-t> riyonuk, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[11:48:54] <necromanger> im doing a type of infinite caroussel that copies the last <li> and plances it has the first <li> on the list, but when i try to click on the images of that cloned element, jquery cannot recognise them has img
[11:49:05] <necromanger> i dunno if i made my self clear on that
[11:49:10] <Eviltwin> Not entirely
[11:49:23] <Eviltwin> Why are you copying instead of moving?
[11:49:56] <necromanger> im moving and copying
[11:50:18] <Eviltwin> How?
[11:51:02] <necromanger> it copies the last <li> element with html() and then it inserts it before the first <li>
[11:51:29] <riyonuk> Eviltwin: mmkay, here you go. http://jsfiddle.net/mnxPa/
[11:51:41] <Eviltwin> Why not $("#foo li:first").before($("#foo li:last"));
[11:51:54] <Eviltwin> Why not just move it and preserve event listeners / data etc
[11:52:11] <necromanger> if i dont move the images the click works. but if they are moved its like it knows they are there and the caroussel moves the same but i cant just click on the images
[11:52:38] <necromanger> thats what im doing
[11:52:57] <necromanger> except im passing it through a variable lol
[11:53:02] <necromanger> maybe thats the problem
[11:53:46] <necromanger> let me test it brb
[11:55:42] <Woet> Eviltwin: www.jqfiddle.net
[11:55:54] <Woet> i was bored.
[11:56:14] <Woet> that's the least ugly way i could think of to make it select jquery by default :p
[11:57:22] <Eviltwin> That's pretty ugly :P
[11:57:43] <Woet> got a better idea?
[11:58:21] <Eviltwin> Forking the project :P
[11:58:33] <Woet> is their source on github?
[11:58:38] <Woet> because i could only find their api and docs there
[11:58:42] <ajpiano> Woet: i think you can pick a custom slug somehow
[11:58:57] <ajpiano> then it could be updated and kept in sync with most current jquery etc
[11:59:05] <Woet> (p.s, i did this since you suggested it a few minutes ago)
[11:59:54] <Woet> Eviltwin: only their chrome app, chrome extensions, docs and stack overflow plugin are on github
[12:00:03] <Woet> ajpiano: how do you mean?
[12:01:57] <necromanger> this is nuts, doesnt work either, its like after the elements get placed into place after the moving, they no longer are recognised has being images
[12:03:58] <devmikey> How do you include jquery on a secure page without generating warnings about unauthenticated content?
[12:04:05] <devmikey> Can you?
[12:04:22] <avium> can anyone explain to me why $(a).click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $('#whatever').load( $(this).attr('href') ); return false; }); would seemingly reload the whole page?
[12:05:13] <avium> if i add a callback to the "load" call, in which i preventDefault, that seems to prevent it from reloading the page
[12:05:17] <avium> but then the ajax call fails
[12:05:25] <avium> or something
[12:05:50] <Woet> ajpiano / Eviltwin: highlight me when you get a better idea, for now it's just a forward
[12:06:00] <Woet> ajpiano / Eviltwin: jqfiddle.com jqfiddle.net and jqfiddle.org all work
[12:08:36] <avium> never mind
[12:08:39] <avium> i think i see the problem
[12:09:20] <avium> document.write call in the html i'm injecting
[12:11:01] <devmikey> How do you include jquery on a secure page without generating warnings about unauthenticated content?
[12:11:03] <devmikey> Can you?
[12:12:39] <Eviltwin> Host it on the secure page?
[12:12:50] <beardbar> simple accordian, trying to use toggleClass to switch .plus to .minus when clicked. http://jsfiddle.net/uB8wv/11/ any help would be rad, thanks!
[12:17:19] <devmikey> Eviltwin: nope
[12:18:27] <Wolf_22> Finally getting some time to teach myself jQuery and I'm unable to find anything explaining what "jQuery("#blah").delegate("a", "mouseenter mouseleave", function(e){...}" is. My main question about this pertains to the jQuery() part... Is this a jQuery constructor? (Obviously, I know nothing about this stuff just yet...)
[12:18:38] <Eviltwin> devmikey: Try using https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js
[12:19:00] <Eviltwin> Wolf_22: How strong do you think your knowledge is of JavaScript
[12:20:04] <Wolf_22> Eviltwin: I know enough about it to use it for standard form validation, etc. I've used it to control certain visual elements, too... So I'm not sure how I should answer that. Ha. I guess "okay"?
[12:20:44] <Wolf_22> (Let's just say I feel stronger with PHP than I do with JavaScript.)
[12:21:26] <Eviltwin> I suggest you poke a this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[12:21:43] <sunscreen> oops youtubes broken
[12:21:47] <riyonuk> Hey guys, another question. When I hover over element A, can it pretend that it's also hovering over element B? Can jQuery do that?
[12:21:48] <Eviltwin> And try to understand at least the majority of the advanced concepts
[12:22:00] <Wolf_22> k, thanks.
[12:22:13] <Eviltwin> Closure is super important
[12:22:22] <Eviltwin> Probably one of the coolest features of JavaScript
[12:22:28] <Eviltwin> And jQuery likes to use it everywhere
[12:22:37] <Eviltwin> So if you don't know what it is, you'll probably be kind of lost
[12:29:22] <shaDykhaN> best way to transition from freelancering to running my own company?
[12:31:00] <jeffmoss> when say $(el).on('mouseover', function(){ ... }); it seems like the listener is trigger for el and every child of el independently, is this normal behavior?
[12:32:58] <Eviltwin> shaDykhaN: Start signing every piece of paper you see
[12:33:06] <RLa> shaDykhaN, first find people who will work there for you
[12:33:13] <Eviltwin> jeffmoss: "independently"?
[12:33:50] <jeffmoss> Eviltwin: el is an actual Element reference, when el has children in the HTML the mouseover is called multiple times, as I'm going over each child
[12:34:06] <jeffmoss> and I just want it to fire once when I enter the el container
[12:34:07] <Eviltwin> That's called Event Bubbling
[12:34:08] <Eviltwin> Google it
[12:35:46] <jeffmoss> I think I understand event bubbling that's what I suspected was happening, can you give me a recommendation for how to proceed and only capture the one event? I've inspected the event object nothing is standing out as an indication which element I've entered
[12:36:27] <spersaud> so when a user types something this is the .keypress() event ??
[12:37:00] <spersaud> I am looking to make a search form for django ... similar to how google works
[12:37:25] <Eviltwin> jeffmoss: ?g jquery event.target
[12:37:31] <Eviltwin> jeffmoss: see ?g jquery event.target
[12:37:32] <bot-t> jeffmoss, event.target – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[12:38:19] <jeffmoss> I see bind has a parameter to turn off bubbling, does the recommended "on" have a better way of doing this other than checking the event target?
[12:39:12] <m3t4> I have keyup function, but how can i use two selectors in one function ? $('input[name=vat_price]').keyup(function() {
[12:40:08] <Eviltwin> jeffmoss: The solution isn't "turning off" event bubbling
[12:41:15] <Eviltwin> Actually, look at mouseenter
[12:41:48] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[12:41:51] <Eviltwin> Scroll down to the demo
[12:45:18] <kelly1212> hey guys, I'm trying to use the jQuery slideToggle function to create a slideDown for every element in a list, however the way it's coded, when an element in the list is clicked, EVERY slideDown event is run instead of just the slideDown for the individual li
[12:45:27] <kelly1212> here's the gist
[12:45:28] <kelly1212> https://gist.github.com/1525060
[12:50:08] <Eviltwin> Do you know why?
[12:53:00] <Eviltwin> kelly1212?
[12:54:14] <kelly1212> ?
[12:54:25] <Eviltwin> kelly1212: Do you know why it's triggering all of them?
[12:54:26] <kelly1212> yea i understand why they all drop down when the list is clicked
[12:54:33] <Eviltwin> Why?
[12:54:34] <kelly1212> yea because they all have the same class name
[12:54:40] <kelly1212> .clickme
[12:54:55] <Eviltwin> $('.book') finds every element with class "book"
[12:54:57] <Eviltwin> No context
[12:55:05] <Eviltwin> Not looking inside any particular element
[12:55:09] <Eviltwin> That's actually what the problem is
[12:55:11] <kelly1212> yea
[12:55:17] <Eviltwin> To fix it, you need to give it a context
[12:55:21] <Eviltwin> So it finds the right one
[12:55:24] <kelly1212> hmmm
[12:55:31] <kelly1212> how do i do that?
[12:55:45] <Eviltwin> The DOM element what was clicked is stored in "this"
[12:56:00] <Eviltwin> Do you can use find on that
[12:56:09] <Eviltwin> $(this).find(".book")
[12:56:15] <Eviltwin> Or simply $(".book",this)
[12:56:26] <kelly1212> ahhh
[12:56:27] <Eviltwin> Which is basically an alias for that first thing
[12:56:29] <kelly1212> that's genius
[12:56:41] <kelly1212> is it like calling the function itself?
[12:56:47] <kelly1212> sort of like self in rails?
[12:57:11] <Eviltwin> Nope, not even close
[12:57:21] <Eviltwin> :D
[12:57:24] <kelly1212> hahaha
[12:57:24] <tom___> can chrome devtools tell me the Xpath of a page element?
[12:57:27] <kelly1212> ok :(
[12:57:37] <kelly1212> so 'this' just calls the DOM element that was clicked?
[12:57:47] <Eviltwin> The original idea is kind of like in rails
[12:58:36] <Eviltwin> Like this idea: http://jsfiddle.net/8VWzM/
[12:58:46] <kelly1212> hmmm when i make the 'this' addition, the function still works, however the same thin happens where all books slide down
[12:59:42] <kelly1212> wow jsfiddle is sweet
[13:00:55] <Eviltwin> So there it's maybe similar to Rails
[13:01:09] <Eviltwin> "this" refers to the object the function was part of when you called it
[13:01:39] <Eviltwin> But jQuery (and other frameworks) tend to abuse "this" for other purposes
[13:01:59] <Eviltwin> In jQuery, it usually refers to a specific DOM element
[13:02:05] <Eviltwin> Like the one you just clicked or whatever
[13:03:10] <kelly1212> awwww
[13:03:13] <kelly1212> that's awesome
[13:06:10] <Eviltwin> You have something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/yd7LX/
[13:06:23] <Eviltwin> You need to add the context to get something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/yd7LX/1/
[13:06:34] <kelly1212> exactly
[13:06:46] <erie> hi
[13:06:49] <kelly1212> but i'd like it if you clicked only one of the tabs and the little bar pops up for that tab
[13:07:23] <Eviltwin> Are you looking at this? http://jsfiddle.net/yd7LX/1/
[13:07:40] <kelly1212> yes
[13:07:42] <Eviltwin> Note the very important "1" at the end
[13:08:07] <kelly1212> hmmm
[13:08:09] <kelly1212> i dont see it
[13:08:19] <Eviltwin> Then open this link: http://jsfiddle.net/yd7LX/1/
[13:08:21] <erie> i'am working with jsp+jquery
[13:08:50] <kelly1212> the '1' at the end of the jquery?
[13:09:03] <kelly1212> im not seeing a one sadly :(
[13:09:06] <Eviltwin> The URL....
[13:09:09] <kelly1212> oooo
[13:09:10] <kelly1212> my bad
[13:09:12] <kelly1212> yes i see that
[13:09:19] <Eviltwin> Now click one of the black boxes
[13:09:28] <kelly1212> cha ching!
[13:09:31] <kelly1212> badass
[13:09:38] <erie> i would like to use to render some dom elements with some data in it
[13:09:49] <erie> is there any good way to doit?
[13:10:07] <Eviltwin> erie: That was exceptionally vague
[13:10:13] <erie> sorry
[13:10:23] <erie> i want to use jquery.data
[13:11:00] <erie> is it possible to use jsp to put data on some dom elements?
[13:11:34] <Eviltwin> You can put it in the tags themselves
[13:12:01] <erie> yikes
[13:12:08] <Eviltwin> <div id="foo" data-password="hunter2"></div> --> $("#foo").data("password") === "hunter2"
[13:12:37] <Eviltwin> It all depends on the use case
[13:12:53] <erie> i didnt know that
[13:13:10] <Eviltwin> Then you clearly didn't read http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:14:51] <rdot> Hey, someone available for a quick question?
[13:14:56] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ rdot
[13:14:56] <bot-t> rdot, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:15:39] <erie> Eviltwin: you mean html5-data*
[13:15:41] <erie> ?
[13:15:44] <kelly1212> Eviltwin, thanks for all of the help, for some reason if i include a comma between the two elements '#list' and '.clickable' it still continues to toggle all hidden elements, and if i don't include a comma it doesn't work at all
[13:15:50] <kelly1212> but it clearly works on your code
[13:15:57] <Eviltwin> erie: Under that heading, yes
[13:16:14] <rdot> My bad, I'm working on a magento site, and I'm trying to use replaceWith in order to rewrite the <select> and <option> tags while keeping their variables, by only using the match of "<select" et cetera, it doesn't seem to be matching, but in the examples it doesn't look like I need to unescape
[13:16:18] <Eviltwin> kelly1212: Send what you're doing
[13:16:21] <Eviltwin> A paste
[13:16:54] <Eviltwin> rdot: I don't quite understand
[13:16:56] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ rdot
[13:16:56] <bot-t> rdot, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[13:17:43] <rdot> Sec. http://pastie.org/3081333  http://tartcollections.com/shop/long-dresses/beth-maxi
[13:18:32] <rdot> Between the two of those, I think it should be sufficient enough. Magento's wrapper.phtml creates the array of the configurable options, and wraps them inside a select for a dropdown. I'm trying to manipulate that to be a set of radio buttons/buttons that I can skin to look more appealing
[13:18:33] <Eviltwin> Oh, you're totally misunderstanding what $("...").replaceWith("...") does
[13:18:43] <erie> generally i skip the html5, so it is going to work on all browsers?
[13:18:45] <rdot> WOW. I am feeling mad dumb.
[13:18:56] <rdot> Where am I wrong if you don't mind
[13:19:27] <JaxCodeMonkey> Okay, I have a tricky question if anyone is up for it.
[13:19:44] <Eviltwin> rdot: The first thing to understand is that JavaScript doesn't interact with HTML, it interacts with the DOM
[13:20:13] <Eviltwin> You're trying to find/replace the HTML source
[13:20:19] <Eviltwin> But that's not what JavaScript operates on
[13:20:37] <rdot> When I need to be replacing the output of the script that's creating that html?
[13:21:32] <Eviltwin> Really, yeah, this looks like something you should be doing server-side
[13:21:44] <JaxCodeMonkey> I'm working on some code that will be a snippet dropped on other websites other than my own. It requires jQuery 1.7. I can test for whether or not jQuery is being used. I can test for whether or not it's a compatible version. But what do I do if it's not a compatible version? How do I load jQuery 1.7 in a way that won't break their old version of jQuery?
[13:22:02] <Eviltwin> rdot: If you don't have any other way to do it, look at http://php.net/manual/en/function.ob-start.php and preg_replace
[13:22:58] <Eviltwin> JaxCodeMonkey: http://benalman.com/projects/run-jquery-code-bookmarklet/
[13:23:26] <rdot> Well thank you very much Eviltwin  I may be back
[13:23:27] <JaxCodeMonkey> I should have known Cowboy would have a solution.
[13:23:43] <Eviltwin> rdot: Talk to #php
[13:23:51] <rdot> <3
[13:23:53] <rdot> ttyl
[13:25:35] <KyouJin-SaMa> hello guys
[13:26:40] <KyouJin-SaMa> i've seen this thing in a website couple of years ago, it's like you take a camera and rotate it 360Â° in a place while it's recording, then what you recorded is used as an image rotated by mous gestures in the website
[13:26:58] <KyouJin-SaMa> i can't figure out how to do that nore what to even google
[13:27:11] <KyouJin-SaMa> googling 3D rotation with jquery didn't pay off
[13:27:52] <KyouJin-SaMa> does anyone have an idea? or at least some key words to look for?
[13:28:44] <kelly1212> does the 'this' function work the same in jQuery Eviltwin?
[13:29:32] * KyouJin-SaMa googles that
[13:29:52] <Eviltwin> kelly1212: What?
[13:30:15] <kelly1212> using 'this' in the function, does it work in jQuery like it does in javascript?
[13:30:34] <Eviltwin> jQuery is JavaScript so yeah
[13:34:09] <kelly1212> so this is what im working with now EvilTwin
[13:34:10] <kelly1212> https://gist.github.com/1525229
[13:34:56] <Eviltwin> Do you know what a CSS selector is?
[13:35:33] <kelly1212> yea ".clickme"
[13:35:37] <kelly1212> and #markers_list
[13:35:48] <Eviltwin> Do you know what it means when there's a comma in one?
[13:36:18] <kelly1212> that the function runs on each individually
[13:36:19] <kelly1212> ?
[13:36:33] <Eviltwin> What does "#markers_list, .clickme" select?
[13:38:13] <kelly1212> the li element with a class of clickme within the element with an id of markers_list
[13:38:18] <Eviltwin> Nope
[13:38:22] <kelly1212> :(
[13:38:33] <kelly1212> does it just select both?
[13:38:41] <Eviltwin> It selects the element #markers_list and any element with class .clickme
[13:39:03] <Eviltwin> If you want any .clickme inside #markers_list
[13:39:04] <kelly1212> ooo
[13:39:06] <Eviltwin> That's #markers_list .clickme
[13:39:10] <Eviltwin> No comma, just a space
[13:40:28] <kelly1212> hmm i saw how the space works with your code, but for some reason when i do a space it just kills the entire slidedown
[13:41:04] <Eviltwin> Well, is there more than one thing with ID "makers_list"?
[13:42:21] <kelly1212> nope
[13:44:25] <Eviltwin> kelly1212: http://jsfiddle.net/kyXcL/
[13:49:05] <kelly1212> does it matter where on the page the script is?
[13:49:24] <Eviltwin> Oh, look at this: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:50:55] <JaxCodeMonkey> Eviltwin: That code from Allman's site isn't working for some reason.
[13:52:28] <Eviltwin> Well what are you trying to do exactly?
[13:53:59] <JaxCodeMonkey> I have been asked to right some code that will need to run on various e-commerce platforms. It's essentially just a snippet that they will include on their pages. The code from Allman's site that you linked to was intended to work in a bookmarklet and doesn't appear to be liking just being thrown on a page.
[13:54:06] <JaxCodeMonkey> wrr, write some code
[13:54:49] <Eviltwin> The thing you ended up with
[13:54:57] <Eviltwin> Did it start with "javascript:"?
[13:55:02] <JaxCodeMonkey> Yes.
[13:55:04] <JaxCodeMonkey> No
[13:55:09] <JaxCodeMonkey> I removed that, and only that.
[13:55:27] <Eviltwin> Then it's still (partially) escaped
[13:55:32] <JaxCodeMonkey> And I put it in some script tags.
[13:56:06] <Eviltwin> Try running an unescape() on it
[13:56:07] <JaxCodeMonkey> Okay, how do I finish removing the escaping?
[13:56:10] <JaxCodeMonkey> oh.
[13:56:10] <Eviltwin> And putting that in
[13:57:12] <JaxCodeMonkey> What am running unescape() on? The entire code snippet from Allman's site?
[13:57:40] <Eviltwin> Less the javascript:
[13:57:44] <JaxCodeMonkey> Gotcha.
[13:57:47] <Eviltwin> And then once you have the unescaped version
[13:57:52] <Eviltwin> You're going to put that in the <script> tags
[14:00:26] <JaxCodeMonkey> I am screwing this up somehow.
[14:00:43] <Eviltwin> Not surprised
[14:01:00] <Eviltwin> :P
[14:01:19] <Cokegod> Is there a way to update jQuery keeping the plugins attached to it? (I'm building an addon to a website that is using an old version of jQuery)
[14:01:35] <JaxCodeMonkey> I'm not certain this needs to be unescaped.
[14:01:51] <Eviltwin> Try this instead: http://pastebin.com/U2TMYi4F
[14:02:50] <Eviltwin> Cokegod: Can you explain further?
[14:03:45] <Cokegod> never mind
[14:03:52] <bennymack> hey guys, not sure if it's ok to ask tablesorter questions here but it seems like when I define a custom parser with addParser, the thing that gets passed into the format function is different in IE8 from FF8
[14:04:03] <Cokegod> but another question: is it possible to convert an XHR object to jqXHR?
[14:06:37] <Eviltwin> Cokegod: Why...
[14:08:27] <waza-ari> Hey all, i have a relativly specific plugin request: Does anyone of you know a plugin which allows me to drag and drop (or somehow other move them) elements from one table to another?
[14:08:38] <Woet> did you think of a better way yet Eviltwin
[14:08:39] <Woet> :(
[14:08:55] <Woet> hold on, i thought of one
[14:09:17] <Cokegod> Eviltwin: i'm trying to do something which invloves an XHR object, and i'd like to use it as a jqXHR object
[14:09:30] <JaxCodeMonkey> Eviltwin: Still not working. Your code pastebin was almost identical to my attempt.
[14:10:38] <Woet> yay Eviltwin
[14:10:40] <Woet> it's better now
[14:11:10] <Woet> www.jqfiddle.net
[14:11:49] <Eviltwin> Cokegod: Again, why?
[14:12:17] <Eviltwin> Woet: nice
[14:12:28] <Woet> can someone update all factoids from bot-t? :p
[14:12:30] <Woet> if needed
[14:18:59] <JaxCodeMonkey> Eviltwin: You
[14:19:15] <Eviltwin> JaxCodeMonkey: Dude, it works for me
[14:19:30] <JaxCodeMonkey> Eviltwin: You're going to kill me, but I can admit when I've screwed up. It's been working the entire time.
[14:20:09] <JaxCodeMonkey> I'm using the firefox Web Developer toolbar, and Information>View Javascript doesn't show it, but it's there anyway, and it works.
[14:20:33] <Eviltwin> Ha
[14:20:54] <JaxCodeMonkey> Thank you for your help.
[14:21:05] <pythonirc1011> For some reason added_url never gets called -- http://pbin.be/show/326/ -- can anyone tell me what i'm doing wrong? alert( Just made ajax call for: ) -- does fire...and i do get the ajax call in the server...
[14:29:00] <TehRabbitt> okay, i'm trying to do an onclick() event on a submit button on an HTML form, but the button's ID changes depending on what the content of the page is, the only thing that stays the same about the button's ID is the last part of the ID... Example: test:blah    test2:blah  test3:blah  where "blah" is the id of the button I want  the test*: is just added in front and is not needed
[14:29:24] <TehRabbitt> I tried over in ##Javascript but since i'm using jquery for parts of my code, they feel i shoudl try using it for this too
[14:30:54] <Vaerros> any way to not have the 'Today' button included in the datepicker button panel? Trying to get it to where only the 'Done' button is inserted
[14:33:40] <waza-ari> Okay, me again... Suppose i have two tables. Is it possible to move one element from table1 to table2 when clicking on it at table1? It should be inserted in correct alphabetical order in table2
[14:38:12] <TehRabbitt> can anyone point me in the right direction?
[14:38:22] <khmer_> `appendTo @ waza-ari
[14:38:26] <khmer_> dangit
[14:38:28] <khmer_> ?appendTo
[14:38:29] <bot-t> .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[14:40:16] <feeeR> TehRabbitt Put the button always the same class and capture the click on the class and not on the id
[14:40:31] <TehRabbitt> feeeR: http://paste.debian.net/150337/
[14:40:44] <TehRabbitt> feeeR: what do you mean the same class?
[14:40:46] <waza-ari> khmer_: this way i could add a new row to a table. But how can sort it then?
[14:41:18] <khmer_> waza-ari: sounds like you need a ui sortable!
[14:41:24] <khmer_> ?sortable @ waza-ari
[14:41:25] <bot-t> waza-ari, UI/API/1.8/Sortable - The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortable
[14:41:47] <TehRabbitt> feeeR: what do you mean by class
[14:42:06] <waza-ari> khmer_: When moving an element from table1 to table2, table2 should be sorted automaticly, for example by name. The user should not be able to sort the table
[14:42:17] <feeeR> the class of the button
[14:42:37] <waza-ari> (sorry when asking silly questions, im relativly new to jquery
[14:42:39] <TehRabbitt> feeeR: not sure what you mean by that
[14:43:08] <TehRabbitt> http://paste.debian.net/150338/
[14:43:12] <TehRabbitt> thats the HTML side of things
[14:43:28] <TehRabbitt> <input id="auditLaptop:printButton" type="submit" name="auditLaptop:printButton" value="Save" onclick="printTag(this.form)" class="inputclass" />
[14:44:39] <feeeR> // Lets grab the form elements and intercept them before being passed to tomcat!
[14:44:39] <feeeR> 		// also only match the last half of the form's ID values and ignore everything before the ':'
[14:44:39] <feeeR> 		//debugger;
[14:44:42] <feeeR> sorry
[14:44:49] <feeeR> Want to capture the text of the input text by giving the button?
[14:44:58] <TehRabbitt> basically, what i'm trying to do is this
[14:45:22] <TehRabbitt> I have a form that I didn't design, someone else did... I have to make a wonderful Dymo Label Printer work with said form WHILE it sends data over to tomcat / works like a regular form
[14:45:33] <TehRabbitt> I was able to get by ID if I set the ID Statically
[14:45:49] <TehRabbitt> but since the ID changes based on what page i'm on, it only works on one out of something like 57 pages
[14:45:53] <khmer_> waza-ari: sorting a table is an operation that requires every row in the table to be modeled so that it has one property that can be given to a comparator. it's not a native DOM operation to reorder DOM elements like that
[14:46:07] <khmer_> waza-ari: if you don't want to write the sort yourself, you're better of using something like jquery-datatables
[14:46:14] <TehRabbitt> all 57 pages, have in common, the fact that the submit button ends with :printButton  for it's id
[14:46:25] <TehRabbitt> whereas the first part of the id changes based on which page it is
[14:46:27] <TehRabbitt> Thanks to JSF
[14:46:44] <TehRabbitt> The rest of the code works, perfectly pretty much
[14:46:53] <TehRabbitt> it's just the "submit" button doens't do onclick()
[14:48:41] <TehRabbitt> any ideas?
[14:49:22] <waza-ari> khmer_: i thought of somethink like http://tinysort.sjeiti.com/ tinysort, but im not quite sure whether i can get it to work on tables
[14:50:20] <waza-ari> Ah there is an example of using it with tables
[14:50:23] <khmer_> waza-ari: no reason why it shouldn't!
[14:51:16] <waza-ari> I think i'll first try to go that way, a combination of .appendTo, tinysort and some self-written JS. Lets give it a try, i can go on and use DataTables after i have failed :)
[14:51:45] <waza-ari> Thanks for your help khmer_
[14:52:04] <khmer_> good luck!
[14:52:19] <waza-ari> Thanks :)
[15:02:52] <dabloem> TehRabbitt, is the actual problem (onclick not functioning) JSF related?
[15:07:04] <melii> ok now i use ajax to load the members
[15:07:34] <melii> eviltwin? are u there?
[15:09:33] <panzi> is there a way to navigate like in Prototype (up/down/next/prev) in jQuery? (next/prev of jQuery has different semantics)
[15:09:43] <panzi> ?
[15:12:44] <melii> try nextAll /prevAll
[15:13:16] <panzi> hmm..., its basically: $(e).up(sel)==$(e).parents(sel).first(); $(e).down(sel)==$(e).find(sel).first(); $(e).next(sel)==$(e).nextAll(sel).first(); $(e).prev(sel)==$(e).prevAll(sel).first();
[15:14:24] <panzi> things like find are immediately evaluated, or aren't they? Is there a way to tell these functions that they may stop at the first found element?
[15:16:12] <dabear> panzi: actually, it would in most cases be a lot faster to select all items and then using .first() than implementing what you're wanting
[15:16:18] <danzik17> panzi: either :first-child or :first depending on your selector.  or use document.querySelector directly ( assuming its supported in your target browsers )
[15:17:30] <dabear> panzi: .filter can also be used with a function, so you can filter out only the elements you need based on custom or more advanced rules than can be expressed using css
[15:18:00] <panzi> danzik17: no that's not what I want
[15:19:22] <panzi> dabear: how can it be faster when you know that you can stop at the first found element instead of searching through a whole bunch of child nodes?
[15:21:00] <snover> panzi: native code vs interpreted code
[15:21:11] <snover> not that that applies here
[15:21:37] <panzi> snover: querySelector does stop at the first found element (and is a native function, if exists)
[15:21:39] <dabear> panzi: kinda depends on your use case really
[15:21:46] <danzik17> panzi: Sizzle ( the selector engine ) uses querySelectorAll underneath the hood.  that returns all elements that match, then processes a psuedo selector like :first.  if you REALLY want to stop at first, you need to use querySelector manually
[15:23:41] <panzi> ok, so I have to use the .first() version. its ok for what I'm doing right now, but I guess it could make problems for another project which I have to eventually prot from prototype to jquery
[15:23:47] <dabear> like danzik17 says, parsing that jquery-only syntax will take up more resources than just using the .first() method of jquery
[15:24:54] <Meekohi> I'm confused about functions and scope inside of plugins. How should I assign options inside .init() such that I can retrieve them later in .play() or whatever?
[15:26:18] <Meekohi> Basically I can never figure out what "this" actually is.
[15:26:39] <dabear> Meekohi: a plugin should in general only have one method exposed on the jquery prototype
[15:27:21] <Meekohi> dabear, Right. Then I check what the string "action" is to that main function, and I have some private functions I want to call based on the string.
[15:27:37] <dabear> Meekohi: yep. jsfiddle some code
[15:27:55] <Meekohi> And inside those functions I want to access the options the user set at the beginning. k one sec.
[15:36:00] <Meekohi> http://jsfiddle.net/m7Wck/3/
[15:37:48] <Meekohi> http://jsfiddle.net/m7Wck/4/ rather.
[15:37:51] <Meekohi> Forgot to save.
[15:42:13] <Meekohi> Baaaah figured it out.
[15:43:25] <dabear> hehe
[15:46:18] <dabear> Meekohi: do tell what you ended up with. did you define the settings variable outside the of the function?
[15:47:19] <Meekohi> I put settings = ... inside the this.each() function, and removed the var (which I guess was making it global scope? Not really sure)
[15:48:40] <Meekohi> Still not really sure what "this" represents inside of init() though.
[15:48:53] <Meekohi> I'm surprised there are no tutorials on this kind of thing, seems like common usage.
[15:50:03] <Meekohi> Makes me want to just get rid of the private functions and slap it all in the main function.
[15:51:12] <dabear> if you have no variable declaration (eg. with "var") the variable will automatically have a global scope if you use it with settings =..
[15:51:56] <Meekohi> dabear, Blargh that is exactly what I do not want...
[15:52:53] <dabear> also, that behavior will break with es5 ( "use strict")
[15:53:46] <Meekohi> dabear, Okay so maybe the thing to do is this.settings = ..., and then pass this into init()?
[15:54:02] <Meekohi> Then the settings are set on each element I guess.
[15:54:07] <Meekohi> Which seems reasonable.
[15:54:40] <dabear> you could do that
[15:55:32] <dabear> do these options need to be per invoction specific, or per element specific?
[15:55:51] <Meekohi> per-element specific might make the most sense.
[15:56:34] <iElectric> can anyone explain why ajax strips script tags here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L216
[15:56:44] <dabear> you might wanna look into jquery ui's Widget factory ( which can be used standalone from the rest of jquery ui)
[15:57:05] <dabear> Meekohi: or you can just attach data to each element
[15:57:22] <dabear> eg with $.data or $(...).data
[15:57:50] <Meekohi> dabear, Huh interesting, I will check that out.
[16:01:18] <dabear> Meekohi: the widget factory also gives you mapping of functions in the widget to a common method on the jquery object for free.
[16:01:26] <dabear> not sure if that made any sense :p
[16:02:06] <dabear> e.g. a widget Foo with methods bar and bas can be accessed through $("dib")
[16:02:28] <dabear> e.g. a widget Foo with methods bar and bas can be accessed through $("div").foo("bar") and $("div").foo("baz")
[16:02:30] <dabear> *
[16:03:53] <Meekohi> dabear: Yeah this looks very useful, I hadn't seen it before.
[16:29:08] <pythonirc1011> If I have to send a file from my server to the client for download/saving, what is the easiest way to do this using jquery/ajax?
[16:36:27] <kelly1212> hello
[16:55:40] <Asone> Ohai o/
[16:56:23] <Meekohi> dabear: Thanks for the tip about .widget, this is making life a lot easier.
[16:57:02] <Asone> i haz a little problem, i got this -> 	$('stats',this).eq(0).append('<'+city_year[j]+'\>'+city_year_count[year]+'</'+city_year[j]+'>'); to generate some lulzy xml. But instead of appending usual '<' and '>' symbol i haz &lt; and &lg; appended; Anyone has an idea about the why of it and/or how i can resolve that ?
[16:57:55] <Asone> ( sorry the bad english ^^' )
[16:57:58] <Asone> +for
[18:01:56] <destryalhmns> if anyone has been closely following my viewport problems and wants to know the ACTUAL answer I am willing to share
[18:02:02] <destryalhmns> for a nickel
[18:02:18] <destryalhmns> i dont see how i should have worked so hard for that knowledge just to give it away for free
[18:03:07] <jstonne> yeah i do wanna know.
[18:03:18] <destryalhmns> okay
[18:03:18] <destryalhmns> so
[18:03:27] <destryalhmns> you know what the meta viewport tag is?
[18:03:31] <jstonne> yeah
[18:03:36] <jstonne> no i don't
[18:03:39] <jstonne> what does it do
[18:03:40] <jstonne> :-)
[18:03:53] <destryalhmns> you gotta tell me what it is just so i know youre not messing with me
[18:04:05] <destryalhmns> just a vague description
[18:04:45] <jstonne> okay it sort of defines the dimension of your site layoutâ€¦ and the initial scaling size of the layout etc?
[18:04:52] <destryalhmns> okay, yep
[18:04:56] <destryalhmns> SO
[18:05:09] <destryalhmns> if you ever have to do anything mobile you will need the viewport tag
[18:05:32] <jstonne> yeah and..?
[18:05:33] <destryalhmns> and you will follow all the instructions and then test it out and then WTF... everything works except the viewport tag
[18:05:46] <destryalhmns> maybe, maybe not, depends on how you test
[18:05:50] <jstonne> umm okay.
[18:05:56] <destryalhmns> trust me
[18:06:02] <jstonne> so why doesn't the viewport tag work?
[18:06:02] <destryalhmns> anyway long story short..
[18:06:20] <destryalhmns> because if you do it locally the ipad doesnt respect it (need to test on a droid tablet tommorow)
[18:06:34] <destryalhmns> i uplaoded it to my website (the EXACT same code) and it worked
[18:06:47] <destryalhmns> does not work locally, does work on a website
[18:07:00] <destryalhmns> rememer that, it may save you some sanity
[18:07:06] <jstonne> ah so it doesn't work locally.
[18:07:11] <jstonne> got it!
[18:07:11] <destryalhmns> apparantly
[18:07:31] <destryalhmns> see to me that it like really valuable information
[18:07:40] <destryalhmns> and to you its like 2 pennies worth of info, but WHATEVER
[18:07:42] <jstonne> yeah i can totally imagine thatâ€¦.. it's likeâ€¦.. trying to locate that missing semicolon in your javascript
[18:07:56] <destryalhmns> way harder
[18:08:00] <jstonne> haha
[18:08:04] <destryalhmns> it was like solving an invisible problem
[18:08:13] <destryalhmns> i deserve a medal for figuring it out
[18:08:24] <destryalhmns> anyway
[18:08:29] <destryalhmns> so now everyone knows
[18:09:07] <jstonne> yeah you gotta tweet it.
[18:09:33] <destryalhmns> i cant figure twitter out, so complicated
[18:09:41] <jstonne> LOL
[18:34:16] <platzhirsch> Does $('#id > tag') in jQuery mean: get me the first occurence of the defined tag in id ?
[18:38:20] <Meekohi> platzhirsch: I thought that mean get all children of #id who are of type tag http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[18:38:49] <Meekohi> So possible multiple, not just the first.
[18:40:25] <platzhirsch> Meekohi: thanks
[18:43:01] <abjorn> coldhod

[18:43:05] <abjorn> calhad
[18:43:08] <abjorn> soup
[18:45:18] <LordThumper> What is the difference between jQuery UI containment: "window" and containment: "document"?
[18:46:28] <nexus2911> I was wondering about a comprehensive list of properties jQuery can animate.  For example, margin-top = marginTop
[18:48:56] <coldhead> hey abjsy
[18:48:59] <nexus2911> So is that the syntax? padding-left = paddingLeft?
[18:49:01] <coldhead> seasons skreetings
[18:49:12] <nexus2911> is it that way for every hypenated css property?
[18:49:27] <coldhead> nexus2911: that syntax is just because javascript thinks - is a minus
[18:49:39] <coldhead> so if there's a - in a CSS property you can camelCase it
[18:49:41] <abjorn> skreetings lols
[18:49:43] <coldhead> to make it work
[18:49:47] <abjorn> what'd you get for coldmas
[18:50:00] <nexus2911> coldhead: ah...so Jquery automatically knows to deal with the hyphen?
[18:50:03] <coldhead> oh precious things, abjorn, precious things
[18:50:10] <abjorn> aka money?
[18:50:22] <coldhead> nexus2911: not exactly automatically, but it translates it for you
[18:50:42] <coldhead> nexus2911: and if that bugs you you can use the - form but you have to quote it: 'padding-left'
[18:50:47] <nexus2911> coldhead: ok great.  thanks.  coming from Flash => jQuery...very cool
[18:50:50] <nexus2911> oh ok
[18:51:06] <coldhead> otherwise it things you're trying to subtract left from padding
[18:51:22] <coldhead> books and music mostly, abjorn
[18:51:33] <coldhead> and the back to the future card game
[18:51:39] <coldhead> how about yourself?
[18:52:23] <abjorn> kitchen stuff for the new apartment
[18:52:25] <abjorn> and money
[18:52:42] <abjorn> oh, and a leather jacked because apparently I'm the fonz
[18:53:04] <wookiehangover> heyyy
[18:53:23] <coldhead> i was going to say, abjorn, you do seem cooler
[18:53:26] <nexus2911> coldhead: if i use 'margin-top' for example, how do i format the colon and then the value?
[18:53:27] <coldhead> and now we know why
[18:53:27] <abjorn> lol
[18:53:50] <coldhead> $('div').css({'margin-top': '99em'})
[18:53:54] <abjorn> the presents i got myself are better
[18:54:02] <coldhead> me too, abjorn
[18:54:05] <coldhead> i know me so well
[18:54:10] <abjorn> right?
[18:54:14] <coldhead> i didn't get myself a white polo shirt
[18:54:21] <coldhead> UNLIKE CERTAIN AUNTS
[18:54:27] <abjorn> oh you have that aunt too?
[18:54:35] <coldhead> WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?!
[18:54:42] <abjorn> the one that gets you clothing that does not match your personality or style in any way?
[18:54:53] <abjorn> like the aunt that gave me the leather jacket
[18:54:53] <nexus2911> coldhead: that syntax isn't working
[18:54:58] <coldhead> give me white supremacist underpants and no one will ever know, but a white polo shirt advertises the fact that i am a cunt
[18:55:11] <krz> how do i put <div>foo</div> before <ul>?
[18:55:16] <coldhead> no no, you rock the leather jacket, abjorn
[18:55:18] <coldhead> grow into it
[18:55:20] <krz> prepend puts it inside <ul>
[18:55:26] <coldhead> nexus2911: i'll do a demo to prove it does :)
[18:55:42] <abjorn> I missed it when she gave me clothes that skater kiddies wear
[18:55:49] <nexus2911> coldhead: ok...for me it only works with marginTop: '200px'
[18:55:53] <abjorn> except i dont miss it at all
[18:56:04] <krz> anyone?
[18:56:29] <abjorn> krz: put up a jsfiddle with an example
[18:56:43] <coldhead> nexus2911: http://jsfiddle.net/ZKK7B/
[18:57:12] <krz> abjorn: its simple. have a <ul>â€¦</ul> element. i need to place <div>foo</div> before the ul element
[18:57:14] <coldhead> here's one with margin top: http://jsfiddle.net/ZKK7B/1/
[18:58:45] <abjorn> ?before @ krz
[18:58:45] <bot-t> krz, .before(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/before/
[18:58:47] <nexus2911> coldhead: I could kick myself...it wasn't the syntax...i didn't close out a comment
[18:58:52] <abjorn> use that on the parent of <ul>, krz
[18:59:06] <coldhead> live and learn, nexus2911 :) good luck
[18:59:28] <krz> thanks: $('ul').before('<div>foo</div>');
[18:59:33] <abjorn> yeah
[18:59:46] <abjorn> looks like i read it wrong lol never used .before()
[18:59:51] <abjorn> just knew of it
[18:59:52] <abjorn> :p
[19:00:18] <nexus2911> coldhead: thank you!
[19:18:45] <shadykhan> is there a good cms for auctioning?
[19:23:27] <coldhead> ebay?
[19:23:53] <E289> if i have a .submit event binded on a form and a .click event binded on a submit button, which will be executed first?
[19:24:14] <sheila> hello E289
[19:24:24] <E289> hi sheila
[19:24:26] <coldhead> it should be the click, E289
[19:24:27] <sheila> im newbieh here
[19:24:33] <coldhead> it should bubble up
[19:24:38] <E289> okay thank you!
[19:24:42] <coldhead> but try it and see
[19:24:48] <sheila> hi coldhead ...
[19:25:32] <sheila> is there any body who know what is the jquery plugin that www.about.me used to edit someone profile ?
[19:26:06] <coldhead> hi sheila, i'm sorry i don't know
[19:26:42] <sheila> well
[19:26:47] <sheila> here is the screen shoot
[19:27:50] <sheila> coldhead ... : http://prntscr.com/4wno1
[19:27:58] <sheila> that is the screenshoot
[19:28:07] <sheila> hello norhwoods
[19:29:04] <sheila> E289 can you tell me what jquery plugin it is : http://prntscr.com/4wno1
[19:29:42] <E289> by checking the source you will be able to do that
[19:30:14] <E289> unless it was intentionally hidden. do you haev the link
[19:30:18] <coldhead> or you can just fucking quit, you stupid sheila
[19:30:40] <coldhead> bot-t: tell sheila thanks for waiting around, it looks like they're using tinymce http://www.tinymce.com/tryit/ajax_load_save.php
[19:30:41] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[19:30:57] <E289> :)
[19:37:15] <kelly1212> can anybody explain to me why the following code wouldn't work?
[19:37:17] <kelly1212> https://gist.github.com/1526074
[19:40:28] <coldhead> works for me, kelly1212 http://jsfiddle.net/TrZJW/
[19:40:32] <kelly1212> really?
[19:40:50] <kelly1212> why doesnt it work if it's in one file?
[19:41:07] <coldhead> are you sure jquery is included?
[19:41:23] <kelly1212> yes, but i dont think that command uses jquery
[19:41:33] <kelly1212> i think it's only javascript
[19:41:36] <coldhead> the $s in your code are definitely jQuery
[19:41:47] <kelly1212> you are right
[19:41:56] <kelly1212> my mistake
[19:42:19] <coldhead> here it is all in one blob http://jsfiddle.net/ELy3Z/
[19:42:22] <coldhead> it still works
[19:43:30] <aple> How do I accomplish the effect seen here? http://madebycrunch.com/
[19:43:38] <aple> Where you scroll a bit and THEN something happens.
[19:44:19] <kelly1212> for some reason it's not working with the space between $(#markers_list .clickme)
[19:44:30] <kelly1212> only works when i put a comma between them
[19:45:14] <coldhead> aple: looks like they're binding to the scroll event in this file: http://madebycrunch.com/scripts/application.js
[19:45:34] <coldhead> line 26
[19:45:45] <coldhead> that shows and hides the menu
[19:45:58] <coldhead> i'm not sure where the code is to change the selected item
[19:46:05] <coldhead> but it's probably something similar
[19:46:38] <coldhead> it means different things with a space, kelly1212
[19:46:54] <kelly1212> whats the difference?
[19:46:56] <kelly1212> :(
[19:47:05] <coldhead> .parentclass .somechildclass as opposed to .parentclass.alsohasthisclass.andthisone
[19:47:50] <coldhead> the first will match children with class="somechildclass" and a parent with class="parentclass"
[19:48:08] <coldhead> the latter matches class="parentclass alsohasthisclass andthisone"
[19:48:54] <coldhead> for your example: with no space it matches <div id="markers_list" class="clickme"
[19:49:01] <kelly1212> awww
[19:49:19] <coldhead> with a space it's <div id="markers_list"> <div class="clickme" /></div>
[19:49:21] <coldhead> capiche?
[19:49:43] <abjorn> CAPICHE
[19:49:49] <kelly1212> :) capiche
[19:49:54] <kelly1212> what does it mean with a comma?
[19:49:57] <coldhead> good work everyone, take 5
[19:50:01] <kelly1212> lol
[19:50:06] <coldhead> oh a comman means you're matching different things
[19:50:12] <coldhead> they're separate selectors
[19:50:28] <kelly1212> hmm can you give me an example?
[19:50:32] <aple> coldhead: Ah, thanks. ;)
[19:50:33] <coldhead> so if i want to match all gypsy classes and all aids classes it's $('.gypsy, .aids')
[19:50:57] <coldhead> that selects either gypsies or aids or gypsies who have aids
[19:51:39] <coldhead> $('.gypsy .aids') selects aids classed elements with a parent gypsy
[19:51:53] <coldhead> and $('.gypsy.aids') only matches class="gypsy aids"
[19:52:00] <coldhead> not just one or the other
[19:52:28] <coldhead> you might want to brush up on your CSS selectors, kelly1212
[19:52:36] <coldhead> jquery uses them a lot
[19:52:54] <abjorn> they are an integral part of the qweries
[19:52:59] <kelly1212> definitely
[19:53:05] <abjorn> also...web development in general...
[19:53:32] <kelly1212> the comboniation of the selectors is what confuses me
[19:53:56] <abjorn> how so
[19:55:51] <coldhead> i am gonna take 5, srsly
[19:56:01] <abjorn> lol
[19:56:16] <abjorn> 5 what coldhead, 5 leather jackets, cause i have one you can have
[20:02:50] <Pritchard> Really upset.  I build a form for another site in good ol' HTML, click submit and it posts.  Make the same request in AJAX and I'm getting cross-origin errors since I'm not submiting to my site.
[20:02:57] <Pritchard> How to get around this?
[20:06:24] <LordThumper> Use JSONP
[20:06:47] <LordThumper> instead of JSON as Datatype
[20:08:02] <coldhead> ?sop workarounds @ Pritchard
[20:08:03] <bot-t> Pritchard, workarounds for the same-origin policy: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/capturing-live-html-page-to-a-jquery-object#14737000000617405
[20:09:32] <vladikoff> sopa workarounds?
[20:09:51] <LordThumper> lol
[20:10:02] <Pritchard> Thanks, guys.
[20:11:53] <Pritchard> Whee!  It appears to have worked :)
[20:12:01] <LordThumper> JSONP?
[20:12:21] <LordThumper> ah nice
[20:16:07] <shesek> Anyone knows how to get Google Closure Compiler to let methods I'm adding on `jQuery.fn` pass through? It seems like it doesn't understand they're really used, and considers them as dead-code.
[20:17:58] <Eviltwin> jQuery doesn't support advanced closure optimizations
[20:20:15] <shesek> Eviltwin, I'm not trying to compile jQuery using closure, I'm trying to compile my own code
[20:20:30] <shesek> Just thought there's some trick to get it working, other than attaching it to the global object
[20:21:18] <shesek> Removal of assignments into `$.fn.stuff` is the only thing stopping me from using it :-\
[20:27:01] <Pritchard> Hi guys.
[20:27:41] <Pritchard> So using dataType: "jsonp" prevented cross-origin errors.
[20:28:03] <Pritchard> When I send my request, the result I'm getting now from my error callback function is "parsererror".
[20:28:28] <Pritchard> All I wanted was to build a script which could delete the 2000+ bot comments from my user page on an external site :(
[20:32:47] <vladikoff> Pritchard, how do we know that you're not the bot
[20:33:01] <Pritchard> Does it matter?
[20:33:04] <Pritchard> o_o
[20:34:14] <Eviltwin> Pritchard: Is your API a JSON API?
[20:34:23] <Pritchard> Eviltwin:  "my" API?
[20:34:29] <Pritchard> This isn't my site.
[20:34:54] <Pritchard> It's a wiki.  I saw a list of comments.  Each comment's given its own form and a button to delete it.
[20:34:59] <Eviltwin> So you're attempting to have your site run code on another site?
[20:35:13] <Eviltwin> You can run code on the page itself
[20:35:15] <Pritchard> I'm attempting to have my PC make form submits on another site.
[20:35:23] <Eviltwin> Via Firebug of the WebKit Deveoper Tools
[20:35:27] <Eviltwin> or*
[20:35:36] <Eviltwin> Developer*
[20:35:47] <vladikoff> Pritchard, basically do it through a javascript console
[20:36:00] <vladikoff> Pritchard, why bother with all the requests
[20:36:00] <Pritchard> Ho'okay.
[20:36:13] <Pritchard> vladikoff:  I don't know what you mean?
[20:36:51] <vladikoff> Pritchard, do you know how to use firebug?
[20:37:13] <Pritchard> I've never used it, so not instantaneously.
[20:37:37] <vladikoff> Pritchard, chrome developer tools?
[20:37:50] <vladikoff> Pritchard, IE F12?
[20:38:16] <Eviltwin> Intro: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[20:38:18] <Pritchard> I've never used any of them extensively, or for JS.
[20:38:37] <vladikoff> Pritchard, well you should. do you use Chrome?
[20:38:50] <Pritchard> Yes.
[20:41:45] <vladikoff> Pritchard, ok open the page in Chrome. Press F12 (opens Developer tools), bottom left corner, second button (looks like '>=' ) opens the console.
[20:41:56] <Pritchard> Cool.
[20:42:04] <vladikoff> Pritchard, you can write your JS there
[20:42:34] <Pritchard> The input's only one-line input.
[20:42:45] <Pritchard> What am I supposed to do with that?
[20:42:46] <kelly1212> why wont this code work if I change the selectors from #markers_list .clickme to ol li?
[20:43:07] <vladikoff> ?paste @ kelly1212
[20:43:07] <bot-t> kelly1212, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:43:19] <vladikoff> kelly1212, can u paste the source you are working with ^
[20:43:25] <kelly1212> https://gist.github.com/1526074
[20:43:39] <kelly1212> SORRY!
[20:43:41] <kelly1212> wrong selectors
[20:43:50] <Pritchard> Yes, I'm confused now.
[20:43:52] <kelly1212> but if you look at line 39
[20:44:05] <Pritchard> Okay, from #list .clickable to what?
[20:44:08] <kelly1212> why cant i change that to ol li
[20:44:20] <kelly1212> $(ol li).click....
[20:44:27] <vladikoff> Pritchard, you can paste multiline code
[20:44:32] <Eviltwin> kelly1212: console.log($("#markers_list")[0]);
[20:44:34] <Pritchard> vladikoff:  Thanks.
[20:44:38] <vladikoff> kelly1212, $("ol li") ?
[20:44:45] <kelly1212> yea\
[20:45:02] <vladikoff> kelly1212, got the quotes in ?
[20:45:15] <kelly1212> yea
[20:45:17] <kelly1212> single quotes
[20:45:22] <kelly1212> does it matter if they are single or double?
[20:45:26] <vladikoff> no
[20:47:01] <vladikoff> kelly1212, works here http://jsfiddle.net/96YYW/
[20:49:11] <Pritchard> -_-... Okay, so I'm debugging and modifying the scripts on this web page, but it doesn't include jQuery.
[20:49:38] <kelly1212> im so confused why it doesnt work in my app :(
[20:50:19] <Pritchard> kelly1212:  View source and make sure the javascript is being updated?
[20:50:22] <Pritchard> Refresh page, etc.
[20:50:31] <vladikoff> Pritchard, add jquery to that page then
[20:50:45] <kelly1212> yea its updating
[20:50:50] <kelly1212> and jquery is included
[20:50:59] <kelly1212> does it matter where on the page the script loads?
[20:51:15] <Pritchard> kelly1212:  When I was talking about jQuery, I was referring to a problem I was having.
[20:51:30] <vladikoff> Pritchard, http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/12/jquerify-bookmarklet
[20:55:27] <Pritchard> vladikoff:  Is this feature included in Chrome by default?
[20:55:36] <Pritchard> Or do I have to get FireBug or use FireFox?
[20:55:45] <kelly1212> oh
[20:55:57] <kelly1212> i still cant figure out why the selectors wont work without a comma?
[20:56:10] <Pritchard> kelly1212:  Those are two different selectors.
[20:56:31] <Pritchard> You're then registering a click event for both li and ol if you're using "ol, li"
[20:56:49] <vladikoff> Pritchard, http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/04/better-stronger-safer-jquerify-bookmarklet/ sorry use this
[20:56:58] <vladikoff> Pritchard, should work eveywhere
[20:57:31] <Pritchard> Thanks :)
[20:57:41] <kelly1212> ooo
[20:57:56] <Pritchard> Well, there's work tomorrow.  Couldn't solve my problem.  This sucks.  Even though I woke up at 10 PM.
[20:58:00] <kelly1212> and ol li refers to an li element in an ol
[20:58:33] <Pritchard> Yes.
[21:00:02] <kelly1212> what does "<a href="javascript:void(0);"> mean?
[21:04:03] <vladikoff> kelly1212, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void
[21:07:32] <Pritchard> >_>...

[21:40:19] <destryalhmns> i just got booted from another channel, probbaly for being too smart, and wanted to make sure everything was still working right
[21:42:22] <destryalhmns> that was a bad joke
[21:42:38] * destryalhmns remembers this is a serious channel
[22:05:11] <cpgo> input box of type text doesnt get change event, to check for this its keyup?
[22:27:02] <ravi1986> HI
[22:29:10] <vladikoff> bye!
[22:41:45] <camo2> hey can someone help me? im at the final stages of finishing this site but i think im have a jquery conflict problem
[22:41:55] <camo2> the url is http://247sec.com/
[22:42:42] <camo2> when you click on SEC VIDEO and then back to SEC NEWS the slider jquery stops working
[22:46:19] <vladikoff> camo2, you need to reinitialize the awShowcase gallery
[22:46:19] <camo2> anyone?
[22:46:49] <camo2> vladikoff: how would i do that?
[22:47:00] <camo2> could you point me in the right direction?
[22:47:30] <vladikoff> camo2, in the nav, you load it via ajax right?
[22:47:45] <vladikoff> camo2, "Video" for example
[22:48:47] <camo2> im using http://pastiebin.com/?page=p&id=4efabbbcf12f3
[22:50:49] <vladikoff> camo2, ok see here http://api.jquery.com/load/ , do you see ''Load was performed.'' example? you need to add that to your .load, instead of the alert call a function that calls the $("#showcase").awShowcase(..) stuff again
[22:52:47] <camo2> ok im going to try
[22:59:47] <camo2> i use $("#showcase").load(awShowcase()) right?
[23:00:21] <vladikoff> camo2, no
[23:04:17] <vladikoff> camo2, for now copy your "$("#showcase").awShowcase(...)" code and paste into "function showNewContent() { ... }"  after $('#content').show('normal',hideLoader());
[23:12:51] <camo2> i just dont know what $("#showcase").awShowcase(...) is
[23:13:15] <camo2> it this closer $('#content').load(.awShowcase());?
[23:13:53] <vladikoff> camo2, no. view the source and search for that , you will find it (line 173)
[23:19:32] <camo2> are you talking about search in the jquery.aw-showcase.js file?
[23:20:13] <camo2> what source file are you talking about?
[23:20:34] <vladikoff> camo2, view source of your website
[23:23:51] <camo2> i see now do i have to do the .load?
[23:23:51] <lijzz> hi could somebody please tell why the site behaves when changing resolution?
[23:28:58] <lijzz> somebody here?
[23:29:25] <ramkam001> echo "hello" : "lo" "lo" "lo" ...
[23:29:46] <lijzz> ramkam :)
[23:30:01] <vladikoff> lijzz, What do you mean? "why the site behaves" explain
[23:30:10] <[1]Cody> hi. what it means?
[23:30:14] <[1]Cody> )) lol
[23:30:15] <lijzz> u see this site http://www.peastilburg.net/
[23:30:34] <lijzz> and now you try to reduce the resolution
[23:31:09] <lijzz> <vladikoff>
[23:32:25] <vladikoff> lijzz, it's using CSS Media Queries, please see 'style.css' for that page, line 2316
[23:32:27] <camo2> vladikoff: i think i kind of understand what you are saying http://pastiebin.com/?page=p&id=4efac5c803c73
[23:33:00] <lijzz> is that becoz of that overflow -x : auto
[23:33:32] <vladikoff> camo2, get rid of  "$('#content').load('normal', function() {" stuff and just call : " $("#showcase").awShowcase(..) " stuff
[23:36:38] <camo2> vladikoff, i tried that and im getting the same results
[23:40:47] <vladikoff> camo2, sorry i gotta sleep, but again, the javascript for the awShowcase needs to run again. when you go to 'VIDEO' it destroys your gallery
[23:41:45] <camo2> vladikoff, ok thanks for your help
