[00:21:21] <litenull> guys, i need some help
[00:22:30] <litenull> on the viewport i set the initial scale and maximum scale. how do i zoom only one div, and not the whole page ?
[00:32:20] <the_dark_knight> Hi, this is how my codeIgniter dir structure looks like - http://i45.tinypic.com/2a4o5yh.jpg. I have a common.js file in js folder. In common.js file, this is my jquery code to refresh a <div> - "$("#secondaryDivId").load("/accountServiceProviderInfo.php #secondaryDivId");". #secondaryDivId is the id of a div present in accountServiceProviderInfo.php view. Currently this doesn't work because I think the jquery can't access the .php file as the pa
[00:41:53] <Selfarian> hi, i'm trying to get jquery working für 2 fields and i didn't get it working
[00:41:55] <litenull> why isnt the auto-hide toolbar documented in jquery mobile documentation ? i'd like to disable it
[00:42:17] <Selfarian> *autocomplete... maybe you could help me: http://jsfiddle.net/g4stL/235/
[00:44:10] <Selfarian> Problem is: the autocomplete works only for the first field and the second field should be filled if you take a choice in the first one. but nothing happens... also the "popup" doesnt really work, if you click on one value, nothing happens...
[00:45:12] <Selfarian> wait... wrong link: http://jsfiddle.net/g4stL/237/
[00:45:49] <DJDan> When i disable droppable the box goes dim.. how do i make it not go dim, and just show the text?
[00:51:12] <litenull> Selfarian: item is not defined ?
[00:52:54] <brantje> I can't get $.on to work
[00:53:07] <brantje> $('#accountscontainer').on('click','.twitterreply',function (){
[00:53:07] <brantje>         console.debug($(this).parent().parent().attr('id'))
[00:53:07] <brantje>          return false;
[00:53:07] <brantje>     });
[00:53:47] <brantje> If i click an item with the class twitterreply it doesn't work
[00:54:08] <litenull> it seems ok
[00:54:16] <brantje> All content is ajax loaded
[00:54:26] <brantje> could that be the problem?
[00:54:53] <litenull> can you make a fiddle ?
[00:55:25] <Cork> brantje: is #accountscontainer also ajax loaded?
[00:55:35] <brantje> Nope, thats static
[00:56:01] <Cork> btw, don't use return false;
[00:56:06] <Cork> use event.preventDefault()
[00:56:06] <brantje> Ok
[00:56:16] <Cork> you will break other event listeners if you use return false
[00:56:35] <Cork> and that might actually be what hitts you here
[00:57:22] <brantje> Even with $(document).on('click','.twitterreply', function (){
[00:57:22] <brantje>         console.debug($(this).parent().parent().attr('id'))
[00:57:22] <brantje>     });	
[00:57:25] <brantje> not working
[00:57:38] <litenull> it works for me, prolly the ajax thing is messing your stuff
[00:57:54] <Cork> the return false; wouldn't cause problem for this event listener; but if you have another event listener on the page it could break this one
[00:58:14] <Cork> brantje: but ya, try to reproduce the problem in jsfiddle
[00:59:17] <litenull> http://jsfiddle.net/g4stL/238/ is this what you're trying to do ?
[00:59:35] <brantje> yea
[00:59:38] <brantje> well
[00:59:41] <brantje> just a sec
[00:59:41] <litenull> it works .. ?
[00:59:53] <litenull> the dynamic loading could be the problem
[01:00:10] <Cork> no, not with delegation
[01:00:38] <litenull> yeah that crossed my mind
[01:02:33] <brantje> http://jsfiddle.net/g4stL/238/
[01:02:43] <brantje> meh
[01:03:19] <krad> hi.  i have an element.. $(element), how can i select its first child?
[01:03:23] <brantje> litenull
[01:03:26] <litenull> yes
[01:03:27] <brantje> this is what i got
[01:03:28] <brantje> http://jsfiddle.net/uHMBH/
[01:04:15] <brantje> Most left image is the twitterreply class
[01:04:30] <krad> $(element).children().first() ?
[01:04:39] <brantje> ty :)
[01:05:44] <Cork> brantje: $('#accountscontainer').length == 0
[01:05:58] <Cork> i suspect thats one of the reasons :)
[01:06:01] <brantje> Nopes
[01:06:12] <litenull> brantje: just a sec my screen is small :D
[01:06:12] <Cork> on that fiddle yes it is
[01:06:24] <Cork> run it your self if you like
[01:06:34] <Cork> console.log($('#accountscontainer').length)
[01:07:51] <brantje> updated it
[01:08:03] <brantje> http://jsfiddle.net/uHMBH/1/
[01:08:16] <brantje> i have serval accounts in the accountscontainer
[01:08:36] <litenull> it works in the new fiddle ?
[01:08:37] <brantje> contained in ".accountupdated"
[01:08:51] <brantje> There it does :/
[01:09:11] <brantje> damn guy's slap me
[01:09:17] <Cork> brantje: so hunt through your code for return false;
[01:09:20] <brantje> was looking at the wrong console -_-
[01:09:26] <Cork> and make sure its event.preventDefault() instead
[01:09:32] <Cork> might be what breaks you
[01:09:37] <brantje> i really need a coffee i assume -_-
[01:09:42] <brantje> Feel really stupid now
[01:09:47] <litenull> :)

[02:18:33] <Joestar79> hi all
[02:19:34] <Joestar79> is it possible using jQuery, to access a table without any id or class or anyother property,knowing only it is a child of an HTML element, a fieldset with a class="module"?
[02:19:49] <Joestar79> I need to dynamically add tr's to that table
[02:20:18] <Joestar79> but the HTML is autogenerated and I must work on it as it is
[02:20:28] <brantje> $('htmlelement > table')
[02:20:50] <jost> Joestar79, "$('fieldset.module > table') " should give you the table
[02:21:02] <brantje> what i said :p
[02:21:10] <Joestar79> thx guys, going to try right away
[02:22:14] <jost> brantje, yep, sorry
[02:22:21] <brantje> np :p
[02:22:30] <brantje> You were just not fast enough :P
[02:23:03] <Joestar79> jost: I needed your line, because I didn't know htmlElement.class syntax either :D
[02:25:59] <Joestar79> actually I have to access tbody with is under table
[02:26:25] <Joestar79> should I just add .tbody?
[02:26:44] <Joestar79> "$('fieldset.module > table.tbody') ?
[02:27:35] <Joestar79> or as soon as I have got my table using the same trick again to get to the tbody?
[02:28:11] <jost> you could use 'fieldset.module > table > tbody', or 'fieldset.module tbody'. The latter would select *every* table-body under that fieldset,  the first only the table bodies directly under the tables that are childs of the fieldset.
[02:28:19] <sacrilicious> good morning
[02:28:52] <jost> Joestar79, probably you should get familiar with this first: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp

[02:30:05] <jost> sacrilicious, $('div:not(#foo)').on('whateverevent', function() { alert('buh'); });

[02:49:38] <wfq> hi guys
[02:50:34] <wfq> what is the best way of creating a simple class to keep my "methods" and "attributes" "encapsulated"? In reality all that I want is to isolate them to not provoke conflicts because I will integrate my little library with other code
[02:50:56] <wfq> I do not need inheritance at all, just a couple of classes. That's all
[02:54:21] <jost> wfq: use the prototype... Constructor: YourClass = function(...) {...}; YourClass.prototype.method1 = function(...) {...};

[02:59:40] <fernandodutra> Hi every one, i'v the following issue: By AJAX the page receive a request JSON and it has a field with HTML, like message: '<p>test</p>', but when i put the value of this field is returned &lt;p&gt;test&lt;/p&gt;. How can i decode it to HTML again?
[02:59:43] <brantje> but i use on('click','.twittersubmitreply',function(){})
[03:00:03] <brantje> fernandodutra, you have to decode the html
[03:00:18] <brantje> var decoded = $("<div/>").html(encodedStr).text();
[03:01:40] <fernandodutra>  brantje: Thank's, i will try to do this!
[03:02:31] <philhutchinson> i dont understand brantje
[03:02:45] <philhutchinson> You want to get the text from the text area when someone clicks the button?
[03:03:19] <brantje> yes :)
[03:03:37] <philhutchinson> why can't you use $("#id").val() ?
[03:04:06] <brantje> well, i create them dynamiclly, and an user can have multiple dialogs open
[03:04:23] <brantje> so them $('#id') won't work
[03:04:42] <becom33> I have a simple menu problem
[03:04:46] <brantje> hmm not an elegant solution
[03:04:52] <brantje> would be like this
[03:04:57] <becom33> was wondering where can I paste it to show it to you guys
[03:05:05] <philhutchinson> becom33: http://jsfiddle.net
[03:05:12] <brantje> id="#id-'+ anumber +'"
[03:05:25] <philhutchinson> or use name=anumber
[03:05:37] <brantje> ah oke :)
[03:05:39] <seutje> don't put a pound in the actual id :P
[03:05:40] <philhutchinson> then use $("input[name='somenumber']").val();
[03:05:51] <philhutchinson> or rather
[03:05:59] <philhutchinson> $("textarea[name='somenumber']").val();
[03:06:11] <brantje> Ok thanks :)

[03:09:48] <brantje> fernandodutra i have no clue

[03:11:19] <seutje> brantje: sure, if there's more after that
[03:11:28] <seutje> like a comma, a function and a closing brace :P
[03:11:33] <brantje> yea :p
[03:12:09] <philhutchinson> I had difficulty getting keyup to work on previous occasions
[03:12:18] <philhutchinson> if that doesn't work try $(document).keyup(
[03:12:49] <brantje> philhutchinson its for ajax / dynamiclly created content

[03:25:02] <Armistice> Guys, what is that tool that will show all issues with jquery?
[03:25:15] <Armistice> Like any warnings, deprecated issues ... I forgot what the tool was called.
[03:25:21] <Kambfhase> migrate
[03:25:35] <Kambfhase> or do you meann lint?
[03:26:46] <Kambfhase> i dont think, jquery-lint is still maintained. (last update 2years ago)
[03:27:00] <Armistice> Migrate is what I'm after I think.
[03:27:54] <the_dark_knight> brantje: Looking into it.
[03:30:03] <Armistice> Hm... the reason I asked is because I'm using a jQuery masonry plugin, and whenever I resize the browser it'll move each item underneath each other. It's suppose to be responsive but no luck there. Here is the masonry: http://213.249.219.79/projects/ShielaLeonard/index.php I wanted to find out if there was any warnings or anything but nothing came up.
[03:33:12] <hip2p> anyone have a recommendation on setting the cursor position of a dynamic element? Seems like all of the examples online talk about onload elements
[03:33:28] <Armistice> I'll try making another div inside the content... maybe that could be bugging it up that i dont have it.
[03:34:22] <Armistice> no that's not it.. hmm, odd.
[03:36:56] <fernandodutra> seutje: Thanks for your suggestion, it's worked!
[03:38:58] <mhn23> @Armistice: did you check the docs? http://goo.gl/ueMy9
[03:41:21] <Armistice> Yep, I was looking at basic single column, because that's all I want.
[03:41:25] <Armistice> just single columns, mhn23
[03:42:33] <mhn23> try to set columnWidth to just the width of one column
[03:42:51] <mhn23> but i don't see the point of using a third party plugin to move div's below each other
[03:43:15] <mhn23> (if they are in one column)
[03:43:53] <Armistice> Multi-columns are when there are items that span across multiple columns.
[03:44:13] <Armistice> Single-column is when the items are in single columns only.
[03:44:47] <Armistice> of course I could have just 2 columns... like two separate divs or 3 or 4... but these results would be from the database.
[03:45:01] <mhn23> yeah but in your example you move these fixed width divs just below each other
[03:45:06] <mhn23> you could do that with css
[03:45:16] <Armistice> SO it'd be dynamically loaded... and it's just easier to have masonry do it... but I have managed to get masonry to work before... it just wont work this time.
[03:45:31] <mhn23> but i think in the <script> tag is wrong
[03:45:40] <mhn23> its not like in the example
[03:46:26] <mhn23> this might confuse masonry
[03:47:52] <Armistice> http://vvcap.net/db/lDDpiFfqXoDQkJ8TROO5.png it's suppose to look like that ... but when you resize the window horizontally, it's suppose to collapse it into 2 collumns, then into 1.
[03:48:03] <Armistice> http://vvcap.net/db/GpUatcAZSqvC-utmqo3q.htp both the masonry calls are the same.
[03:48:11] <Armistice> but with different class names...
[03:48:59] <Armistice> and the fact I check if the container exists.
[03:51:10] <Armistice> but also one thing I have noticed, the container on the example expands the full width ... mine doesn't.
[03:51:13] <Armistice> That could be why
[03:54:23] <reloadz> hi! as i scroll page how can i read the how many px i have scroled from top of the page?
[03:55:17] <Armistice> oh. I think it was the clearfixes inline-block styling
[03:56:03] <Armistice> seems like it.
[03:56:40] <Armistice> yep that was it
[03:58:29] <mindis|wurk> i hate writing rich text editors. what a goddamn mess every time
[04:09:48] <brantje> how can i execute an fuction when an element with "timeago" class is shown via an ajax call
[04:14:27] <Kambfhase> brantje: there is no crossbrowser compatible way of listening to DOM manipulation events
[04:14:53] <brantje> well i don;t use IE for my application
[04:15:00] <brantje> FF / Chrome
[04:16:46] <Kambfhase> well it might be easier, to either explicitly call that function or do that via custom events
[04:17:33] <brantje> $(document).on('contentchanged','.timeago',function(){})
[04:48:46] <noregret> anybody uses the tooltip in jquery-ui 1.10 ? is <br/> not suppoerted anymore or is it a bug ? it was fine in 1.9
[04:49:28] <computer2000> how can i trigger an event as soon as an element receives a certain class? i'd need to listen on that element for this to happen somehow
[04:50:01] <Kambfhase> ?trigger @ computer2000

[04:51:47] <computer2000> Kambfhase: how can i use .trigger to listen for class name changes
[04:51:59] <computer2000> dont think thats possible that way
[04:52:22] <quicksilver> computer2000: you can't do it.
[04:52:25] <Kambfhase> no, but when you change the class,  you can trigger an event
[04:52:47] <quicksilver> there are no reliable/crossbrowser events automatically triggered by class changes or other DOM changes.
[04:53:17] <quicksilver> if you have control of when it's happening you can wrap it / trigger something yourself; otherwise you'll just have to check periodically or when you think it might have changed.
[04:53:29] <computer2000> quicksilver: ok thx

[05:05:22] <frosch> Hi! If I have a form and I want to enable / disable the submit button if the user has entered something into an input field I would attach some keyup event to the input field.  But what if the submit button should be enabled if the user has entered some text in one of three input fields?
[05:06:14] <noregret> Kambfhase: no i didn't, but i'll give it a shot
[05:06:14] <Kambfhase> frosch: why not use a validation plugin?
[05:06:19] <frosch> Should I handle multiple input fields the same as one? Should I add a class to each of the input fields instead? Whats the best practice for something like that?
[05:08:21] <Dover> Hmm, I'm looking for a solution where I can replicate form inputs when clicking on a + button. The problem is the + buttons is wrapped inside the same div as the form element, so I can't just clone the parent and place it after the current parent
[05:08:58] <Dover> Anyone got any good addons that do this, or an article/code snippet to point me in the right direction
[05:09:11] <gnarf> noregret:
[05:09:16] <Kakera> I need to set a timeout for a socket, but only for connection. Should I: 1) call setTimeout(0) after a successful connection, and setTimeout(n) before reconnecting, or; 2) use the callback in setTimeout(n, callback), which, I suppose, is equivalent to socket.once('timeout', callback)

[05:09:58] <elephphant> Hi, I am generating an image over ajax (mime return type is png). I am then trying to pass it to another to save that image. Is there alterations i need to do to the reponce that is added on ?
[05:10:02] <frosch> Kambfhase: I'm in the process of looking at some form validation plugins (like diryform, form wizard) but it's more that I'm generally interested in whats the best practice to handle multiple input fields. Code replication vs using (css)-classes?
[05:10:05] <elephphant> response *
[05:10:16] <gnarf> if you give it a content: function() { return $(this).attr("title"); } option it should go back to the old behavior
[05:10:32] <Kakera> I don't like the first solution because it keeps changing the timeout, and I don't like the second because I'd be re-assigning the same timeout handler every time I reconnect
[05:11:30] <litenull> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10545540/jquery-mobile-disable-tap-to-toggle-fixed-header-and-footer Is there a better solution to this ?

[05:28:01] <CptCaptain> I tried to $.post an object which contains a couple of Date objects. The JSON representation of those Date objects seems to be created with toString(), which creates some weird localized Date string ("Wed Jan 30 2013 14:22:48 GMT+0100 (MitteleuropÃ¤ische Zeit)"). Is there a way to make it use a standard date string format?

[06:10:51] <Trisox> Two4: you could also use Selected on a option to pre select the dropDownHidden
[06:12:21] <Trisox> Two4: like $("#"+$("#someNiceId option:selected").val()).show();
[06:12:47] <Trisox> there http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/wRpw9/5/
[06:13:49] <Mottie> noregret: You can pass data an object, jQuery serialize it for you
[06:14:49] <Two4> cool, might be better
[06:15:14] <Trisox> yes if your use a flow and use back button ;-) it pre selects the right value

[06:17:41] <johnkpaul> BadCodSmell: th's are treated specially by dom creation methods
[06:17:51] <johnkpaul> because they have to be inside of tables or something, tbh, I dont' remember

[07:04:47] <mbrzuzy> Kingsy, probably a scope issue
[07:05:03] <Kingsy> well yeah, but I am asking why its that way
[07:05:20] <Kingsy> the logic LOOKS fine to me.. I don't get it
[07:05:33] <Kingsy> it works on a regualr foreach() {}
[07:05:44] <mbrzuzy> because in the each statement this is in the scope of $('.lightbox')
[07:06:09] <Kingsy> is it possible to use a variable declared outside?
[07:06:17] <mbrzuzy> yeah
[07:06:19] <Kingsy> i.e pass it in and out like a regular function?
[07:06:48] <Kingsy> mbrzuzy: could you show me a little example?

[07:09:07] <mbrzuzy> Kingsy, declare album as album = [];
[07:09:16] <mbrzuzy> then when you access it do self.album
[07:10:34] <Kingsy> mbrzuzy: naa it needs to be this.album so I can access it in different functions in the same class
[07:11:04] <mbrzuzy> Kingsy, you would be able to, but would need to access it with self

If I reset the left/right styles of the element inbetween, it works better. Anyone knows how I can avoid side effects when calling position() twice with exact same parameters on the same element?
[07:13:38] <gnarf> Danwe: you're using UI's position extension?
[07:13:43] <Kingsy> mbrzuzy: thanks, it makes sense, of course this in the each is going to reference a different object.
[07:13:48] <Kingsy> DUH
[07:13:50] <Kingsy> mbrzuzy: thanks
[07:13:56] <gnarf> Danwe: also, do you have a demo for me to look at? see ?demo
[07:13:57] <bot-t> Danwe, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:13:58] <mbrzuzy> no problem :P
[07:16:21] <Dover> Hi, how can I get the name of a DOM element by class with jquery? Not the actual DOM element itself, but just something like "input" or "div" is what I'm after
[07:16:55] <Kambfhase> this.tagName
[07:18:19] <Kambfhase> ?eval jQuery("<div/>")[0].tagName @ Dover
[07:18:19] <bot-t> Dover: undefined
[07:18:30] <Kambfhase> ?eval jQuery("<div/>")[0].tagName
[07:18:31] <bot-t> Kambfhase: undefined
[07:18:34] <Kambfhase> dafuq?
[07:18:36] <raygerrard> kingsy instead of using proxy you could to var that = this; before your .each then use that.property inside the each
[07:19:08] <Brodingo> ?eval $.fn.jquery
[07:19:09] <bot-t> Brodingo: "1.4.2"
[07:19:31] <Brodingo> ?eval $('<div>').length
[07:19:32] <bot-t> Brodingo: 1
[07:19:40] <Brodingo> ?eval $('<div>').[0].tagName
[07:19:41] <bot-t> Brodingo: SyntaxError: missing name after . operator
[07:19:42] <Bonieky> Hi, anyone have could invite me to #php channel?
[07:19:50] <Brodingo> ?eval $('<div>')[0].tagName
[07:19:51] <bot-t> Brodingo: undefined
[07:19:51] <Dover> ?eval jQuery("<div/>)[0].nodeName
[07:19:52] <bot-t> Dover: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
[07:19:56] <Brodingo> no dom
[07:19:57] <Bonieky> i am trying to access but it said only for invited users
[07:20:03] <Brodingo> ?
[07:21:00] <Bonieky> hi Brodingo
[07:21:11] <Bonieky> are you able to access #php?
[07:21:24] <Brodingo> i dont know
[07:21:36] <Brodingo> it might be private
[07:22:03] <Dover> Kambfhase: Thanks for pointing me in the right direction, it's nodeName
[07:22:30] <Dover> I was looking for [0] (or get(0)) already but wasn't aware of .nodeName
[07:23:03] <Kambfhase> yeah .tagName and .nodeName are same same, but different
[07:24:03] <Bonieky> Brodingo, did you know someone who has access?
[07:24:19] <Brodingo> nope
[07:24:49] <Bonieky> Brodingo, where are you from?
[07:24:57] <g0bl1n> if one toggle() an element, how can one test if its visible or not ?
[07:25:14] <Kambfhase> ?:visible @ g0bl1n
[07:25:14] <Brodingo> Bonieky land of lobsters
[07:25:15] <bot-t> g0bl1n, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[07:25:23] <g0bl1n> ty
[07:25:28] <Dover> Kambfhase: same same but different :P?
[07:25:45] <Bonieky> g0b|1n, you can do $(OBJECT).is(':visible') or put directly into the selector, like: $('#test:visible')
[07:29:09] <Kambfhase> Dover: there is a difference between tag and node, i just cant seem to find the appropriate article
[07:32:11] <Bonieky> Kambfhase, i guess "tag" is the "src" from <img src=""> and node is "img"
[07:32:14] <Bonieky> if you know what i mean
[07:32:27] <Kambfhase> err, nope
[07:32:33] <Kambfhase> thats an attribute
[07:32:55] <Kambfhase> a node ist <p> ... </p> with all the html in between
[07:33:04] <Kambfhase> <p> and </p> are both tags
[07:33:31] <Kambfhase> Hence there are text nodes, but no text tags
[07:35:09] <Bonieky> Kambfhase, yes you're right.. From javascript point of view, that's correct... I was talking with html concepts..
[07:36:43] <xec> Bonieky: the terminology is the same. src is an attribute
[07:37:27] <xec> Bonieky: a "tag" is basically what starts with a < and ends with a >
[07:38:22] <Joestar79> how do I get the whole content of <script type="text/html" id="caricoprodotti-template"> using jQuery?
[07:38:32] <Joestar79> I need to retrieve that template to use with underscore.js
[07:38:51] <Kambfhase> a script with type=text/html?
[07:39:02] <Kingsy> is it easy enough to disable and enable events on elements?
[07:39:37] <xec> Bonieky: so, "</p>" is a tag, while "<p>text</p>" would generate a paragraph node containing a text node in the DOM
[07:40:44] <Joestar79> Kambfhase: that's the way I need to define to stick HTML inside it and use it with underscore.js
[07:40:46] <Bonieky> xec, thank you. I was cofunding the names
[07:41:26] <Danwe> gnarf: I am using this position thingy, says it is jQuery core: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Position
[07:41:26] <Kambfhase> have you tried $("#whatever-templ").html() ?
[07:44:12] <gnarf> Danwe: that is a jQuery UI extension to .position()
[07:44:34] <gnarf> Danwe: http://jqueryui.com/position/
[07:44:48] <Danwe> gnarf: right... anyhow, its loaded and used
[07:45:11] <Danwe> I'll try to generate a demo
[07:45:13] <gnarf> http://api.jqueryui.com/position/
[07:45:49] <faraway> Joestar79: i think you need to use .text() or .html() depending if you use IE or other browsers
[07:46:21] <Joestar79> fraway: .html() didn't work, I'm gonna try with .text()
[07:46:51] <Joestar79> faraway I don't have a div inside the template but a tr with some td
[07:46:55] <Joestar79> could it be the problem?
[07:48:07] <Joestar79> faraway: thx man! text() worked! I've struggling with this for so many hours. Thx a lot!
[07:48:08] <faraway> Joestar79: don't think so ... the content of the <script type="text/html" ... > is plain text and not parsed as html
[07:55:20] <faraway> Joestar79: i did this:  var content =  $(element).text()||$(element).html()   so that it will work with all browsers .. but i'm not sure anymore if you get the the <script ...> also ... so you should check this
[07:56:20] <Joestar79> faraway: going to test on IE9, thx
[07:56:45] <Cork> uh... why wouldn't text() work on any browser?
[07:57:28] <Joestar79> faraway: it worked with .text() as well Should I test against all other browser version as well?
[07:59:00] <niix> What's the deal with defining a jQuery function like this: !function ($) { }(window.jQuery);
[07:59:01] <faraway> Cork, Joestar79: i'm not sure anymore, but i the test file i have locally, i have a note that it does not work every where with .text(), but sadly the not where it is not working is missing.
[07:59:28] <faraway> note
[07:59:45] <Cork> faraway: all major browsers support innerText == .text()
[08:00:13] <Cork> well correction
[08:00:20] <Cork> textContent && innerText
[08:00:27] <Cork> gecko uses textContent
[08:00:44] <faraway> Cork: the time i tested was with jquery 1.7.1
[08:01:02] <Cork> faraway: this has been true for ages
[08:01:15] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, I need this counter to countdown to 11AM every morning, then restart, but I can't seem to figure out the timings. Can anyone assist? http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/7/
[08:01:24] <Cork> i've used it cross browsers back in jquery 1.2.3
[08:01:33] <johnkpaul> niix: so you don't have to override window.$ in order to use the shorthand $
[08:02:07] <niix> johnkpaul: I see, and when would that become useful?
[08:02:52] <johnkpaul> niix: when you use $.noConflict() and you still want to be able to use $ in code that you know that should use jquery as $
[08:03:09] <k610> e.g i got two div 50% & 50%, how can easily make the second go bellow the first if the window size is < e.g 70% of screen width
[08:04:57] <raygerrard> can you not use media queries?
[08:05:30] <k610> im using bootstrap but it seems their responsive classes don't do this
[08:06:11] <k610> maybe theirs something like columnal or skeleton that's compatible with bootstrap ?
[08:07:46] <faraway> Cork: in ie 6-8 i only get the script content with .html() not with .text()
[08:08:19] <Cork> ah for scripts
[08:08:27] <Cork> ya, that would be logical
[08:08:35] <Cork> didn't know that was the target element
[08:12:46] <faraway> Joestar79: for IE 6-8 you need the .html() fallback
[08:13:26] <Joestar79> faraway: thx alot for confirming this man
[08:13:31] <VinSpee> does mobile safari not support $.keypress?
[08:14:07] <faraway> Joestar79: no problem, i would have looked a this the next days again anyway.
[08:24:09] <computer2000> whats the most recommended way to execute things just before one leaves a page? $(window).unload() seems strange... sometimes executes, sometimes doesnt
[08:27:11] <monk3y> computer2000: yeah I've just dealt with that 'old chestnut', and still can't be confident that it's the best way.
[08:27:32] <monk3y> Unfortunately different browsers respond differently, but there's heaps of pages of people dealing with the same question.
[08:27:42] <computer2000> monk3y: diving right into it...
[08:27:45] <monk3y> (all using .unload, .beforeUnload, etc)
[08:27:46] <Cork> ?mdc beforeunload @ computer2000

[08:28:55] <Darkstar1> Hi all. I have a puzzle I can''t quite figure out why a jquery scrolll bar isn't displaying: http://5.39.50.84/monassier/index.php?id=363
[08:29:10] <computer2000> i need to execute a function as soon as someone leaves the page
[08:29:37] <Darkstar1> If you click on the second grey bar on screen it' like it's loaded the scroll bar but something's disabled it
[08:31:31] <Cork> computer2000: you can't execute anything when the user leaves, but you can when a use plans to leave
[08:32:09] <computer2000> Cork: hmm well
[08:32:34] <Cork> and unless you throw up a dialog preventing the user from leaving (return false;) network calls will be dropped when that happens
[08:32:53] <Darkstar1> Anybody pls?
[08:34:05] <scar> how can i use jQuery slide down if the element is display:none; with css?
[08:35:03] <Cork> scar: don't hide it with css
[08:35:11] <Cork> hide it with .hide() on dom ready
[08:35:49] <ravenzz> or hide with CSS but read this http://paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/
[08:36:37] <scar> ahh
[08:36:39] <scar> ;)
[08:36:46] <scar> i was trying to figure out the complicated way
[08:38:03] <Darkstar1> Would appreciate any hints
[08:39:37] <morganestes> @Darkstar1, which second grey bar?
[08:39:44] <morganestes> which text is is?
[08:39:50] <ravenzz> I was going to ask the same question
[08:40:02] <Forbidd3n> How would I get the checked radio button value - name of the attributes being - Account[rate_class_id]
[08:40:02] <Darkstar1> morganestes: the one with Pole Entreprise
[08:40:03] <ravenzz> Darkstar1 do you mean Pôle Entreprise et Patrimoine?
[08:40:09] <Darkstar1> ravenzz: yeah
[08:40:40] <Darkstar1> The text area is meant to be scrollable and I have used it elsewhere but for some reason, it's disabled on this element class.
[08:40:47] <ravenzz> and what do you mean by jquery scroll? is that a plugin?
[08:40:57] <Darkstar1> as if the size isn't reconized
[08:41:07] <Darkstar1> Yeah
[08:41:22] <Darkstar1> I use this plugin: http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/
[08:41:31] <Kambfhase> Darkstar1: you have overflow: hidden
[08:41:52] <Kambfhase> should be overflow:scroll
[08:42:04] <Darkstar1> On what?
[08:42:25] <morganestes> Darkstar1: on the element div.mCustomScrollBox#mCSB_2 the inline style
[08:42:49] <computer2000> anyone knows this: in theory, it should be possible to save images to browser localStorage/sessionStorage? as strings?
[08:43:01] <computer2000> how much space is allowed for sessionstorage?
[08:43:07] <dblosevn> probally base64 encdoed
[08:43:12] <computer2000> dblosevn: yea
[08:43:50] <dblosevn> =man my back hurts
[08:43:54] <Darkstar1> morganestes: That's from the plugins' code. changing that shows the normal system scroll bar
[08:44:07] <dblosevn> missed my damn flight, stuck at the airport for hours now
[08:44:09] <Darkstar1> I'm replacing that with one from this plugin
[08:44:22] <morganestes> computer2000, you can use base64 to save to localStorage. each site has 5MB on browsers that support it
[08:44:35] <computer2000> morganestes: 5MB?? thats a lot!
[08:44:44] <dblosevn> and wtf plastick knife to eat a steak
[08:45:16] <Kambfhase> yeah, real man eat steack with their claws
[08:45:22] <morganestes> that's using Web SQL, but it's not being actively supported anymore
[08:45:32] <morganestes> try http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage
[08:46:01] <dblosevn> id rather not get steak juice on my computer
[08:46:22] <dblosevn> whos bright ass idea was it to put an outback in an airport anyways
[08:47:19] <dblosevn> beers good at least lmao
[08:48:00] <Forbidd3n> How would I get the checked radio button value - name of the attributes being - Account[rate_class_id]
[08:49:34] <amcsi_work> hi
[08:50:00] <dblosevn> $('input[name="account\\[rate_class_id\\]:checked"]').val();
[08:50:00] <amcsi_work> how can I determine whether a value won't die of syntax error if I try to read one of its properties?
[08:50:27] <Cork> amcsi_work: what do you mean?
[08:50:32] <amcsi_work> if (val && ('function' == typeof val || 'object' == typeof val)) is a bit long :/
[08:50:40] <Forbidd3n> dblosevn: thanks I will try it. I wasn't escaping the []
[08:50:49] <keirlav87> i'm trying to us msIndexedDb for ie < 10,  but I get the following error LOG: TypeError: Unable to get value of the property 'open': object is null or undefined  - anyone familir with this?
[08:50:52] <dblosevn> make sure to double escape
[08:50:57] <tomasm-> hi, if I have a form that has an onSubmit, and also uses ajaxForm(), how can I ensure the ajaxForm only fires IF the onSubmit is true? or do I need to copy the onSubmit code (and erase the original) as a check before the ajaxForm()
[08:51:10] <dblosevn> first escape is for the interpreter second for jquery
[08:51:15] <amcsi_work> I don't want to ensure that val won't throw 'val is not an object' as an error
[08:51:29] <Cork> amcsi_work: and val is a variable or what?
[08:51:34] <amcsi_work> yea
[08:51:41] <Cork> or is it a member of an object?
[08:51:54] <amcsi_work> it can be anything in the world
[08:52:21] <Cork> then you couldn't have val first
[08:52:35] <NoiseEee> amcsi_work: anytime you try to access <doesn'tExist>.property you will get an error.
[08:52:35] <lil-murph> in 1.8+, how would I use deferred.then() to check the return of an ajax and cause a 'success' to be a 'failure' if some specific data was returned?
[08:52:36] <amcsi_work> it can be a simple object, an extended object, an array, a function, null, undefined, a number etc
[08:52:36] <Cork> if that variable is undefined it will crash
[08:53:08] <amcsi_work> <NoiseEee> This is exactly the reason I am asking for help here
[08:53:17] <NoiseEee> amcsi_work: there's no getting around it
[08:53:26] <Cork> amcsi_work: you have to first test typeof(val) == 'undefined'
[08:53:35] <amcsi_work> So what's the easiest way to test whether a value can have its property read
[08:53:46] <NoiseEee> amcsi_work: thats not your question
[08:53:51] <Cork> exactly
[08:53:53] <amcsi_work> like I said:  if (val && ('function' == typeof val || 'object' == typeof val)) is too long, I'd like to ask for a shorter one
[08:53:57] <Forbidd3n> dblosevn: getting undefined
[08:54:06] <NoiseEee> amcsi_work: your question is 'how can i make sure something exists before i ask for a property of it'
[08:54:17] <dblosevn> ?demo @ Forbidd3n
[08:54:17] <bot-t> Forbidd3n, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:54:21] <Cork> amcsi_work: from what you just said, that check is faulty
[08:54:22] <amcsi_work> ok, pardon my phrasing
[08:54:41] <NoiseEee> amcsi_work: if(typeof Whatever!=='undefined') { //Whatever exists, so grab some properties }
[08:54:44] <Guest68543> 404 Not Found  The server can not find the requested page:      www.jquerye.com/jquery-1.6.3.min.js (port 80)...how can i get rid of this error
[08:54:57] <amcsi_work> I know how I'd ensure it once I find out the right way to check it. If it fails, I just make it into an empty object.
[08:54:59] <NoiseEee> amcsi_work: that being said, you'll also have to check for 'somethingElse' if you want Whatever.somethingElse.anotherProperty
[08:55:02] <dblosevn> quit trying to include that file that doesnt exist...
[08:55:10] <lil-murph> I guess I'm looking for an example of a failFilter for a Deferred.then() that causes some success cases to now be error cases. Does anyone have one?
[08:55:17] <amcsi_work> NoiseEee: not good, because scalar types cannot have their properties checked
[08:55:25] <dblosevn> @ Guest68543
[08:55:30] <NoiseEee> amcsi_work: then you can just if(!something)
[08:55:44] <Guest68543> yes @dblosevn
[08:55:59] <tomasm-> is it possible to stop event propagation from within an 'onSubmit' handler? (as inserted into the form tag) I'm just not sure if there is an 'event' var to access
[08:56:09] <amcsi_work> oh wait, scalar types can have their properties read
[08:56:27] <dblosevn> Guest68543: quit trying to include that file that doesnt exist... include jquery from one of the many places its hosted for free eg google apis etc
[08:56:31] <amcsi_work> except null and undefined :/
[08:56:40] <BillCriswell> If you want to get reggy with it! /^(function|object)$/.test( typeof val )
[08:58:58] <amcsi_work> oh wait
[08:59:08] <amcsi_work> I have the easiest answer then
[08:59:16] <amcsi_work> I just test for if (val)
[08:59:40] <amcsi_work> if it passes, I am guaranteed not to get a syntax error if I read val.someProperty
[08:59:41] <scriabin> I'm trying to get some jquery included in twitter-bootstrap to work on my RoR site.  I can see the jquery I have added in the inspector, and the tags in the DOM are accessible from the console, but when I run the function, it fails.  http://imgur.com/Mly52TW  I don't understand why this is happening.
[08:59:41] <amcsi_work> thanks!
[09:00:14] <philhutchinson>  tomasm-: nah theres no event, just use return false;
[09:00:16] <scriabin> can anyone suggest some troubleshooting steps?
[09:00:32] <BillCriswell> scriabin: What does $ return?
[09:00:45] <philhutchinson> oh wait tomasm-: do you mean to prevent submit?
[09:00:47] <tomasm-> philhutchinson, the problem is there are several event handlers on it, and the one in onSubmit needs to prevent the others from happening (some via onSubmit attribute, some via jquery)
[09:00:55] <scriabin> BillCriswell: function (e,t){return new v.fn.init(e,t,n)}
[09:01:06] <philhutchinson> if its not to stop the actual submit
[09:01:10] <philhutchinson> you can use
[09:01:21] <philhutchinson> .submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[09:01:24] <tomasm-> philhutchinson, onSubmit has a handler for required fields, and if that fails, it shouldnt let any other submit handlers (ie ajaxForm()) take place
[09:01:25] <philhutchinson> if thats helpful
[09:01:30] <keirlav87> what property can i check with $.support to check indexeddb?
[09:01:37] <philhutchinson> oh
[09:02:07] <philhutchinson> tomasm-: paste your submit stuff to http://jsfiddle.net and ill take a look
[09:02:31] <BillCriswell> scriabin: Can you use like $('foo').addClass() and things like that?
[09:03:57] <scriabin> BillCriswell: I'm sorry.  I'm clueless what that means.  When I type $('foo').addClass() I see [ ]
[09:04:41] <keirlav87> is there any indexeddb support in ie < 10?
[09:04:45] <BillCriswell> scriabin: I'm thinking there's just something wrong with the  popover plugin.
[09:05:04] <keirlav87> even vendor prefix-ed support like window.msIndexedDb
[09:05:35] <scriabin> my intuition is that the error _init undefined means that there is no popover plugin (like I've failed to include the javascript) - is that possible?
[09:06:02] <BillCriswell> See what $.fn.popover returns
[09:06:38] <BillCriswell> scriabin: It's probably something as simple as not including it haha.
[09:06:51] <tomasm-> philhutchinson, it's hard to pastebin since it's scattered in lots of places, but essentially, I have two submit handlers and I want the first to stop the second from triggering. but event.stopPropagation() isn't working, even though the event object exists. I suspect it has to do with using an onSubmit attribute in one place and a jquery event handler (bind) in another place
[09:06:53] <scriabin> it returns a bunch of stuff
[09:07:05] <scriabin> $.fn.popover function (i){var s=typeof i=="string",o=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,1),u=this;return i=!s&&o.length?e.extend.apply(null,[!0,i].concat(o)):i,s&&i.charAt(0)==="_"?u:(s?this.each(function(){var r=e.data(this,n),s=r&&e.isFunction(r[i])?r[i].apply(r,o):r;if(s!==r&&s!==t)return u=s,!1}):this.each(function(){var t=e.data(this,n);t?t.option(i||{})._init():e.data(this,n,new r(i,this))}),u)}
[09:07:37] <BillCriswell> have the url of the plugin?
[09:07:40] <philhutchinson> tomasm-: is there any reason you're binding to the event iself?
[09:07:47] <BillCriswell> I looked it up but I think I'm looking at the wrong one.
[09:08:06] <tomasm-> philhutchinson, it's some old code I don't think I can change....
[09:08:14] <philhutchinson> if not, bind the first one to the event, and call the second one from the first one (with all the parameters) once the first one completes successfully
[09:08:44] <scriabin> BillCriswell: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
[09:08:52] <tomasm-> philhutchinson, I can't call them nested like that, one is generalized for modal dialogs that happens irrelevant of what else happens
[09:09:04] <DarkKnightCZ> how to make image preloader working in IE? $("<img/>")[0].src = url; doesnt work
[09:09:42] <scriabin> BillCriswell: is it true that if things were working, typing $("a[rel=popover]").popover() should cause the popover to appear in the browser?
[09:09:52] <scriabin> I'm confused about what that does
[09:09:57] <BillCriswell> How until you click it based on the default options.
[09:09:58] <philhutchinson> cant you just pass a parameter to tell it that this is a specific case
[09:10:23] <BillCriswell> I hate sticky navigations on the left side of the screen.
[09:10:38] <dblosevn> DarkKnightCZ: you have to actually append it to the dom to make it load them image and why not $('<img />').attr('src', url);
[09:10:53] <BillCriswell> s/How/Not *
[09:11:01] <tomasm-> philhutchinson, the two event handlers are totally irrelevant (and instantiated from separate library files) so I cant have them communciate to each other. but seems that stopImmediatePropagation() does something stopPropagation() doesnt
[09:11:39] <jfisk1987> hey all
[09:11:47] <jfisk1987> how can i clone an jquery object to another?
[09:12:00] <dblosevn> .extend
[09:12:01] <jfisk1987> like $newObject = $("#someOtherObjectIWannaCopy")
[09:12:02] <BillCriswell> scriabin: Probably much easier to figure out if given the direct link.
[09:12:14] <BillCriswell> jfisk1987: with .clone()
[09:12:24] <dblosevn> that too lol
[09:12:31] <philhutchinson> ah ok tomasm-
[09:12:35] <philhutchinson> hmm im not sure then
[09:12:55] <tomasm-> anyone know what the diff is between stopImmediatePropagation() and stopPropagation() ?
[09:12:56] <BillCriswell> var $copy = $('#original').clone(true); The argument is for copying events as well.
[09:13:03] <scriabin> BillCriswell: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap
[09:13:08] <jfisk1987> thank you BillCriswell
[09:13:23] <DarkKnightCZ> dblosevn: still doesnt work in IE, in every other browser it works
[09:13:28] <philhutchinson> scriabin: whats the issue? it doesnt appear?
[09:13:33] <BillCriswell> scriabin: I understand, but depending on how YOUR code is set up it could be different.
[09:16:14] <litenull> tomasm-: stoppropagation will prevent any parent handlers from being executed while stopimmediatepropagation will prevent all handlers from being..
[09:16:53] <tomasm-> litenull, not sure I understand the difference... "parent" handlers?
[09:17:28] <tomasm-> you mean the same handler for an ancestor node?
[09:18:28] <litenull> i suggest you to read this: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[09:19:08] <tomasm-> so stopPropagation would simply stop a document.click, for example, and not other click() on the object?
[09:19:14] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, I need this counter to countdown to 11AM every morning, then restart, but I can't seem to figure out the timings. Can anyone assist? http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/7/
[09:19:58] <scriabin> philhutchinson: the popover function doesn't work
[09:20:26] <litenull> tomasm-: the stoppropagation stops the ancestor nodes but allow other event handlers
[09:21:15] <philhutchinson> No piss take but are you sure the bootstrap JS library is loaded? it's not loaded by default
[09:21:48] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: would suggest using requestAnimationFrame instead
[09:22:18] <fRAiLtY-> Cork, how would that affect the timer though?
[09:22:22] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: that wouldn't fix the timing problem, but it would make the page more well behaved
[09:22:30] <scriabin> philhutchinson: I *think* it's loaded.  RoR has an asset pipeline, so it minifies all the js into a single application.js file.  so I may not be loading it.  How do I confirm this from the console?
[09:22:36] <fRAiLtY-> Ok, what about the timing issue as that's the "main" one
[09:22:39] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: what is it that fails with the timer?
[09:24:17] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: that it doesn't sync with the target time?
[09:24:45] <fRAiLtY-> It's odd, every time you refresh, it "starts" again
[09:25:03] <fRAiLtY-> So for example it's approx18hrs until 11am tomorrow, but it's not showing that
[09:25:27] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: do you actually look for the target date ?
[09:25:29] <fRAiLtY-> Everytime you refresh, it starts again from 23:59:59
[09:25:34] <Cork> that is the next 11am time?
[09:25:57] <fRAiLtY-> I think ts
[09:26:00] <litenull> still on the timer :)))
[09:26:28] <Cork> ah, ok
[09:26:33] <Cork> let me dig into this a bit
[09:26:37] <Ansikt> Is requestAnimationFrame being used by jQuery 1.9?
[09:26:39] <fRAiLtY-> litenull:  Yes, it's f'ing me off!
[09:26:50] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Thank you, highlight me if you have any queries
[09:26:56] <litenull> fRAiLtY-: i know that feel
[09:26:58] <philhutchinson> scriabin: run $("#element").popover({ trigger : 'hover'});
[09:27:12] <philhutchinson> and check the error console
[09:27:15] <Ansikt> I find a bunch of posts saying that it was pulled during the 1.6 series, and that there were plans to add it back in 1.7, but I saw no final verdict on this
[09:27:38] <philhutchinson> scriabin: you need bootstrap-tooltip.js loaded too
[09:27:39] <philhutchinson> just fyio
[09:27:41] <philhutchinson> fyi*
[09:27:45] <wfq> guys
[09:27:55] <gnarf> Ansikt: what?
[09:28:23] <wfq> what is the best way to execute a script if a particular id is present in the html please?
[09:28:25] <gnarf> Ansikt: http://plugins.jquery.com/requestAnimationFrame/
[09:28:30] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: btw when you set the time you could just do ts.setHours(11 + (ts.getHours() > 11 ? 24 : 0));
[09:28:39] <wfq> I adding my own javascript library to a existing cms
[09:28:53] <Ansikt> Ah.  So, it's not in jQuery proper?
[09:29:05] <Ansikt> Still, that plugin was exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks
[09:29:20] <gnarf> Ansikt: no problem
[09:29:20] <Ansikt> gnarf: ^
[09:29:31] <gnarf> Ansikt: always happy to plug my plugin
[09:29:32] <gnarf> :)
[09:29:53] <philhutchinson> wfq: if ($("#element").length == 0) { // id exists } else { // id does not exist }
[09:29:56] <gnarf> Ansikt: feel free to point those "articles on the internet" at my plugin too ;)
[09:30:10] <Kambfhase> philhutchinson: != ;)
[09:30:15] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: on line 141?
[09:30:16] <philhutchinson> shirte
[09:30:17] <philhutchinson> shite
[09:30:23] <philhutchinson> wfq: if ($("#element").length != 0) { // id exists } else { // id does not exist }
[09:30:26] <Kambfhase> shit ?
[09:30:33] <philhutchinson> oops ;p
[09:30:38] <Kambfhase> ^^
[09:30:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: line 139 - 147
[09:30:50] <Cork> instead of that
[09:30:56] <wfq> philhutchinson, really? I thought there was a built-in function for it
[09:30:57] <wfq> thanks
[09:31:04] <philhutchinson> well
[09:31:35] <philhutchinson> wfq: you can use if (document.getElementById("element")) { // id exists } else { // doesnt exist }
[09:31:44] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: though so, now counts down 18hrs, but "restarts" on each refresh http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/7/
[09:31:59] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/CQkL8/8/
[09:32:20] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: it wasn't a fix but it was a simplification of the code
[09:32:20] <wfq> well I knew that one but I prefer to use jquery. Probably the latter has a better performance but it is alright
[09:32:21] <wfq> thanks
[09:32:25] <Cork> i'm still getting to the counter :)
[09:33:02] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  But it has altered the value to a more realistic value, it seems it's not able to countdown from mid-way through an hour or something? Each refresh triggers it to start, in this case, from 18:00:00
[09:33:15] <philhutchinson> no worries wfq
[09:33:57] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: give me ca 10-15 mins to trace through this
[09:34:09] <Cork> can't talk too much about it before i know it beter
[09:34:13] <Cork> *better
[09:35:08] <[fields]> I'm attempting to utilize jQueryUI tabs.  I am testing this in Firefox,Chrome,IE9,Safari & Safari for iPad.  There seems to be an icon for each tab nav item that I didn't intend on being there.  I do not see this icon on the theme-roller.  Does anyone know how to easily remove these tab nav item icons?
[09:35:23] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: btw why don't you just ask the date object for getHours(), getMinutes(), getSeconds() instead of doing it your self?
[09:35:42] <BadCodSmell> Why would appendTo destroy my scope?
[09:36:09] <Kambfhase> ?p @ BadCodSmell
[09:36:10] <bot-t> BadCodSmell, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:36:12] <BillCriswell_> .some() is a weird method name for what it does.
[09:36:49] <Kambfhase> well, it returns true, if some of the elements are truthy
[09:37:17] <BillCriswell_> Kambfhase: It returns true if any of them are truthy. It exists on the first truthy.
[09:37:24] <BillCriswell_> it exits*
[09:37:28] <BadCodSmell> function in object1 calls a function in object2. When the script returns from calling the function in object2, I am now in object2's scope still!
[09:37:46] <BadCodSmell> I call other functions and they do not do this
[09:37:51] <BadCodSmell> but appendTo does
[09:37:59] <wfq> philhutchinson, found a way it to wrap it up: jQuery.fn.exists = function(){return this.length>0;}
[09:38:14] <BillCriswell_> .atLeastOne() maybe? haha.
[09:38:15] <Kambfhase> BillCriswell: you should not think about functional programming like that.
[09:38:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/9/
[09:38:34] <BillCriswell_> Kambfhase: I probably am thinking about it wrong. :-/
[09:39:04] <BadCodSmell> How can I append using jquery without destroyingthe scope?
[09:39:19] <Kambfhase> you should not care about the order in with things happen to the list, only the result is important
[09:39:28] <scriabin> philhutchinson: can I load that from the console?
[09:39:44] <Kambfhase> ?p @ BadCodSmell
[09:39:44] <bot-t> BadCodSmell, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:39:56] <BadCodSmell> It's too big
[09:40:02] <philhutchinson> scriabin: yeah you should be able to
[09:40:04] <philhutchinson> lol
[09:41:07] <Kambfhase> just the important bits.
[09:41:36] <BadCodSmell> Just tell me why append would nuke the scope
[09:41:45] <kamoricks> JQuery doesn't seem to be sending POST content for a $.ajax request using CORS. Why not?
[09:41:50] <BadCodSmell> How is it even possible?
[09:41:53] * Cork pokes fRAiLtY-
[09:42:03] <BadCodSmell> append must be doing something very obviously funky
[09:42:21] <BadCodSmell> to make it return to a different but the same scope
[09:42:24] <Kambfhase> append cannot do anything to your scope. the problem is your code
[09:42:49] <MacDada> Hi! I want to prevent my form from being sent when user hits "enter" on his/her keyboard. I listen for "keyup" event, preventDefault and return false. Yet, the form is still submitted. Any ideas? https://gist.github.com/4675031
[09:43:03] <BadCodSmell> I walked through with a debugger and it happens right after calling afunction that does nothing but append
[09:43:04] <fission6> whats the appropriate way to listener for an input check box being checked?
[09:43:32] <Darkstar1> Need help with a jquery plugin if anyone can spare me some time.
[09:43:40] <Kambfhase> ?change @ fission6
[09:43:41] <bot-t> fission6, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[09:43:43] <fission6> ok thanks
[09:44:35] <philhutchinson> MacDada: try .live('keyup', instead
[09:44:46] <MacDada> philhutchinson: ok
[09:44:53] <philhutchinson> I've often found it works better
[09:45:23] <litenull> philhutchinson: live is deprecated, btw
[09:45:48] <MacDada> philhutchinson: live doesnt work either
[09:46:01] <Mottie> live was removed in 1.9
[09:46:07] <litenull> MacDada: which jquery are you using ?
[09:46:22] <litenull> MacDada: use .on
[09:46:36] <tw2113> live() is removed from 1.9
[09:46:47] <MacDada> litenull: 1.8.3 and there is no way I'm gonna upgrade to 1.9, so don't worry, live will work ;)
[09:47:06] <BadCodSmell> its firebug being screwy
[09:47:12] <litenull> MacDada: :D
[09:47:26] <tw2113> it's still recommended to use .on() though
[09:47:31] <MacDada> well, at least either live or on should workâ€¦
[09:47:35] <Cork> live was a plague that just shouldn't have been in there to begin with
[09:47:52] <softmanpetro> I've created a dialog with $("<div class='popupDialog'>Loading...</div>").dialog({... how to close it please ?
[09:47:58] <tw2113> Cork survived the live plague
[09:48:15] <Cork> ya, cause i never got infected by it
[09:48:18] <Cork> :)
[09:49:05] <litenull> :)
[09:49:18] <softmanpetro> $('.ui-widget-overlay').on("click", function() {$("<div class='popupDialog'>Loading...</div>").dialog("close");
[09:49:26] <MacDada> Cork: my coworkers are infected by "live". No matter how many times I explain them advantages of "on". Now, when somebody decides we should upgrade, I won't change a letter in the code :P
[09:49:26] <softmanpetro> dows not work
[09:49:30] <philhutchinson> MacDada: try keydown
[09:49:31] <leaetmika> Hi guys i am trying to use google map API
[09:49:34] <leaetmika> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-map/wiki/jquery_ui_map_v_3_tutorial
[09:49:36] <litenull> softmanpetro: $('#popupDialog')
[09:49:48] <litenull> use that
[09:49:53] <leaetmika> anyone use that before /
[09:49:57] <philhutchinson> and stick an alert in the top of the handler to check its actually firing
[09:49:58] <Cork> MacDada: heh lovely
[09:50:11] <leaetmika> not sure how to get the coordinate of my destination
[09:50:20] <Cork> MacDada: delegate has been part of jquery almost as long as live, and its a MUCH better option to do the same thing
[09:50:37] <litenull> its also more logic
[09:50:45] <Cork> ya
[09:50:53] <Cork> you actually understand what the command do
[09:51:02] <tw2113> MacDada, scream that your coworkers are holding back the internet and throw a pile of papers up in the air, maybe tip over a desk, kiss the nearest decently attractive female, then walk out of the building
[09:51:04] <Cork> contrary to what live "looks" like it does
[09:51:17] <Cork> while it actually does something completely different
[09:51:44] <MacDada> philhutchinson: THX! keydown event works :)
[09:51:46] <softmanpetro> litenull $("#popupDialog").dialog("close"); does not work
[09:52:02] <Cork> softmanpetro: its a class not an id
[09:52:13] <Cork> $(".popupDialog").dialog("close");
[09:52:31] <litenull> sorry :)
[09:53:12] <jesterea> Hi everybody, i'm looking for an online book / tutorial I stumbled over a few month ago but can't find anymore. If somebody could help me with finding it that'd be great. It was an introduction to javascript which would guide you through the jQuery source (the first thing you were asked was to download the source) and which would guide you through the library, explaining the techniques used in more detail. Any ideas where to find it
[09:53:13] <jesterea> again? I think it was free and open source, but I might be wrong there.
[09:53:22] <kamoricks> Does $.post() simply ignore the data parameter when doing CORS? It doesn't seem to be sending a message body, despite me providing a PlainObject.
[09:53:27] <softmanpetro>  $(".popupDialog").dialog("close"); not good too...
[09:53:32] <softmanpetro> are you sure is that ?
[09:53:41] <Cork> kamoricks: you can't do post cors
[09:53:49] <kamoricks> Cork: Uh. Why not?
[09:54:10] <Cork> Kambfhase: unless you mean modern cors where the server on the other ends sets a header
[09:54:16] <litenull> softmanpetro: the syntax is right.
[09:54:33] <Cork> *kamoricks:
[09:54:41] <kamoricks> Cork: Yeah, I'm sending Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * and Access-Control-Allow-Headers: x-requested-with
[09:54:49] <Cork> ah
[09:54:56] <Cork> then ya that should work
[09:55:02] <Cork> except in ie that is
[09:55:09] <softmanpetro> was created with $("<div class='popupDialog'>Loading...</div>").dialog({          autoOpen: true,          closeOnEscape: true,          height: 'auto',          modal: true,          show: 'fade',          width: 'auto' Cork
[09:55:11] <Cork> ie doesn't support cors
[09:55:12] <MacDada> well, so now that I do preventDefault(), my input doesnt send the form on hitting enter, butâ€¦ it also stops other listeners o.O
[09:55:35] <softmanpetro> all i need is to see it closes when click on overlay
[09:56:18] <softmanpetro>     $('.ui-widget-overlay').live("click",  is doing that :)
[09:56:21] <softmanpetro> huuh
[09:56:25] <Cork> softmanpetro: you want to remove the dialog completely?
[09:56:31] <kamoricks> Yeah, I know, IE I'll have to do an XDomainRequest. But I'm testing in Opera and Chrome 22, and they both claim that there's no body sent despite me providing a data param. http://jsfiddle.net/CT3Qa/ is the exact code I'm using.
[09:56:37] <softmanpetro> yes coaster
[09:56:40] <softmanpetro> Cork
[09:56:46] <softmanpetro> oops coaster
[09:56:50] <Cork> then $(".popupDialog"),remove() is prob what you want
[09:57:00] <Cork> close doesn't remove the dialog from dom
[09:57:02] <softmanpetro> thx
[09:57:21] <Cork> softmanpetro: and like we just said; don't use live
[09:57:24] <Cork> use delegate or on
[09:57:37] <softmanpetro> on does not work
[09:57:42] <Mottie> jesterea: was it this site? http://ejohn.org/apps/workshop/intro/#2
[09:57:54] <softmanpetro> $('.ui-widget-overlay').on("click", function() { it does not work
[09:58:09] <softmanpetro> is the syntax right ^ ?
[09:58:17] <Cork> softmanpetro: $(document).on('click' ,'.ui-widget-overlay-', function() {})
[09:58:21] <Cork> no
[09:58:25] <jesterea> Mottie: No, but i'll check it out. It was more like a book than a slideshow.
[09:58:26] <softmanpetro> ah
[09:58:27] <discorpia> softmanpetro: for live binding you put the selector in the on statement and use it on document
[09:58:39] <softmanpetro> k
[09:58:47] <jesterea> And it had a Homepage with links and everything...
[09:59:20] <kamoricks> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/CT3Qa/1/ has code, proper version of JQUery used, request, and response. Any idea why JQuery isn't including the body?
[09:59:48] <softmanpetro> works like a charm
[10:01:19] <Cork> kamoricks: do you have a possibility to not run it on localhost?
[10:01:33] <Cork> that is a bit of a special case, and might cause problem
[10:01:45] <Cork> not saying that is the cause though
[10:02:01] <kamoricks> Cork: Sure, I can edit my hosts file.
[10:02:20] <jesterea> But I think i'll start watching this: http://paulirish.com/2010/10-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/
[10:02:25] <Cork> kamoricks: no its actually the ip not the hostname
[10:02:29] <Mottie> jesterea: lol ok this one? http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[10:02:37] <Mottie> jesterea: yeah that's a good one
[10:02:40] <kamoricks> Cork: Then not in any convienent way.
[10:02:47] <Cork> ok
[10:02:51] <kamoricks> Cork: Actually, looking at the MDN docs, it seems like this request shouldn't be preflighted at all.
[10:02:52] <Mottie> jesterea: but it's not beginning level
[10:03:20] <wfq> guys if I have function MyObject() {} and then MyObject.foo = function () {} and MyObject.bar = function () {} How could I call foo from bar? this.foo() from bar does complaint and say that foo isn't a funciton
[10:03:21] <jesterea> I wanna learn advanced JS, I'm reading the good parts and I'd like to see some of it in action
[10:03:22] <wfq> *funciton
[10:03:43] <kamoricks> wfq: "this" isn't bound like you think itis.
[10:04:06] <jesterea> Mottie: Thx, that one looks good too, but I can skip the basics I think
[10:04:28] <Mottie> jesterea: oh ok :P
[10:04:37] <kamoricks> wfq: MyObject.bar.call(obj); will cause 'this' to refer to obj in that invocation of MyObject.bar
[10:04:38] <wfq> kamoricks why and what should I do then please?
[10:04:53] <jesterea> Mottie: I mean i can skip the first chapters and i can see what he's doing object-encapsulating - wise etc.
[10:05:24] <Cork> js> function test() {  }; test.prototype.a = function() { this.b(); }; test.prototype.b = function() { print('hello'); }; var t = new test(); t.a()
[10:05:27] <b-ot> Cork: hello
[10:05:40] <Mottie> jesterea: then check out this book about design patterns: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[10:05:41] <Cork> wfq: that's how this is related
[10:05:56] <litenull> that is one advanced bot :D
[10:06:01] <kamoricks> (Note the difference: He's adding the methods to the object's prototype, not to the instance of the object.)
[10:07:01] <jesterea> Mottie: I like the first one, it's cool, dig the console / interpreter, nice work. The Design Patterns thing looks nice! Very nice.
[10:07:24] <kamoricks> Alrighty. Looks like we'll just use $_GET for this, SNI issues be disregarded.
[10:10:10] <wfq> Kamoricks,Cork, Sorry but I use a prototype constructor yet I get the following error in line 142: TypeError: _this_.composeRow is not a function. Please see here: http://dpaste.com/900553/
[10:11:51] <Cork> wfq: you need to store the this variable before you use callbacks
[10:12:07] <Cork> wfq: each function get its own this variable
[10:12:17] <Trisox> Cork: o/
[10:12:25] <wfq> Cork, yeah sorry . I realized about that error while posting
[10:12:26] <Cork> so what you have inside done and fail isn't the this you think of
[10:12:34] <wfq> I have fixed it now
[10:12:36] <wfq> thank you so much
[10:12:44] <Cork> a simple var self = this; before ajax should solve that
[10:12:55] <Cork> Trisox: o/
[10:12:55] <wfq> that's exactly what I have done
[10:13:02] <Trisox> var that = this :d
[10:13:07] <Trisox> thats what i always do
[10:13:12] <Trisox> sup
[10:13:18] <wfq> kamoricks, Cork, thanks again guys
[10:13:27] <wfq> Trisox, actually it is a good idea
[10:13:35] <Cork> Trisox: nothing much
[10:13:39] <wfq> thanks for tip, very descriptive
[10:13:49] <Trisox> what do you guys use for validation ?
[10:13:56] <Trisox> client side
[10:14:11] <Cork> i normally just write a simple validation function
[10:14:22] <Cork> that validate based on classes i set on the input field
[10:14:40] <Trisox> jquery validate
[10:14:44] <Cork> but i know many use jquery validator
[10:14:45] <Trisox> i use that
[10:14:59] <Trisox> this looks promising also http://parsleyjs.org/documentation.html
[10:15:17] <Cork> just configuring it would be almost as much code as the entire validator when i write it my self :)
[10:15:22] <Cork> so i find it kinda pointless
[10:15:40] <Trisox> mwah dont agree
[10:16:10] <Trisox> jquery validator is verry flexible
[10:16:27] <Cork> and if i did a new project with that need now days i would most likely write it around html5 validaton
[10:16:32] <Cork> Trisox: ya it is
[10:16:41] <kamoricks> Hmm. $.ajax() seems to be ignoring data:, even for GET requests.
[10:16:44] <Cork> but its also quite chubby cause of all that
[10:16:53] <kamoricks> Even without CORS. Even with isLocal: false. Why?
[10:17:08] <Cork> kamoricks: that sounds really wrong
[10:17:19] <Cork> especially without cors
[10:17:23] <Trisox> chubby yea true
[10:17:28] <Cork> and with cors shouldn't be a problem
[10:17:46] <Trisox> brb dinner :D
[10:18:34] <kamoricks> Cork: Okay. My bad, it works fine with { 'test': 'test' }, but fails with {'Login_Submit_User': 'test'}. Any idea why?
[10:20:47] <kamoricks> Cork: Because it ignores key/value pairs whose value is 'undefined'. Awesome. Thanks.
[10:20:54] * kamoricks should probably take a break.
[10:22:04] <Cork> lol
[10:22:19] <Cork> so the second example wasn't the truth
[10:22:39] <Cork> and that's prob why your original post solution failed :)
[10:23:15] <kamoricks> Yes, it indeed was.
[10:25:20] <vsmith> Hey guys I was wondering if anyone can help me with a problem on a site where I had a jquery image slider that worked before but out of nowhere stopped working
[10:25:31] <vsmith> I dont see any js errors.
[10:25:55] <vsmith> the site is www.docupro1.com
[10:26:24] <vsmith> seems like none of my jquery scripts are working
[10:26:39] <Brodingo> vsmith theres 3 errors
[10:26:39] <litenull> vsmith: there are 3 errors
[10:26:50] <litenull> msie, superfish
[10:28:40] <Brodingo> vsmith the site is using google's jquery which was probably recently updated to 1.9
[10:28:48] <fission6> man this is killing me, i have a page which works fine with ff, safari, and chrome, the i try it out on my iPad and it does not work, any theories?
[10:29:16] <losted> Hello everyone, I'm trying to use jQuery UI Sortable with Tabs just like the demo on the jQuery UI website at http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists-through-tabs but just like the demo I get the error "Uncaught Error: no such method 'select' for tabs widget instance". Does anyone know how to get around this? thanks
[10:29:41] <chriys> fission6 are you running flash on it ?
[10:29:47] <vsmith> okay
[10:29:57] <fission6> sorry wrong channel
[10:30:16] <Brodingo> vsmith browser was removed in 1.9 so just revert to 1.8
[10:30:29] <vsmith> okay thanks
[10:30:39] <vsmith> thank you Brodingo
[10:30:39] <Brodingo> though that might not fix the super fish error
[10:30:45] <Forbidd3n> is there any way to only allow one decimal point in a text field with digits only
[10:30:52] <Brodingo> but its a good first step
[10:30:57] <Forbidd3n> meaning they can't type in 0.45.54.6
[10:31:14] <Forbidd3n> should only be able to do 0.4534
[10:31:20] <chriys> Forbidd3n see for regalar expression
[10:31:27] <chriys> regular*
[10:34:07] <chriys> Forbidd3n here is a little tutorial http://www.designchemical.com/blog/index.php/jquery/form-validation-using-jquery-and-regular-expressions/  you can adapt it to your situation. If you need more comprehension look to siteduzero.com or google.com :)
[10:36:20] <lxsameer> i'm writing a plugin, but when i use "$.on(....)" in my plugin body, i get an error that says "$ is not defined" why?
[10:36:40] <kamoricks> lxsameer: Because you don't have jquery in the current scope.
[10:37:05] <lxsameer> kamoricks: why ? i pass JQuery as a argument
[10:37:31] <codepython777> Would someone be interested in taking a stab at this: http://www.dpreview.com/challenges/ChallengeSlideshow.aspx?ID=7862&EntryID=700254&View=Results using jquery?
[10:37:35] <monk3y> jQuery as the argument '$', or 'jQuery'?
[10:38:17] <chriys> lxsameer: what they mean is that $.on selects nothing
[10:38:33] <Mottie> codepython777: check out http://galleria.io/
[10:39:18] <chriys> you have to tell to your script to apply some operation on a selected object on your page if noone is select nothing will happens and you will have error
[10:39:30] <codepython777> Mottie: its not close to the dpreview one. At least the classic/free looks are not
[10:40:07] <Cork> lxsameer: the plugin shouild be wrapped in (function($) {})(jQuery);
[10:40:28] <codepython777> Mottie: Another problem with galleria: https://github.com/aino/galleria/issues/281
[10:40:28] <b-ot> codepython777: Issue #281 by pythonmobile (4h 18m ago): Another dead project?
[10:41:15] <codepython777> Mottie: time to redo galleria I think?
[10:41:58] <Mottie> src was updated a day ago
[10:42:15] <codepython777> Mottie: thats surprising.
[10:42:26] <codepython777> Mottie: Seems like the dead project question did get them moving.
[10:42:28] <Mottie> https://github.com/aino/galleria/commit/b06068dc04b85dad6f9ecf31d730a15e398b7615
[10:42:28] <b-ot> Mottie: David Hellsing (23h 51m ago): no swipe while zoomed
[10:43:31] <Mottie> You can probably make your own theme to make it look like you want.
[10:43:33] <codepython777> Mottie: why arent the devs fixing the issues reported then?
[10:43:44] <Mottie> I am not a mind reader
[10:44:51] <Nocte> hi?
[10:44:57] <Mottie> although, I bet you're thinking about chocolate now that I've mentioned it
[10:44:58] <codepython777> Mottie: I'm a newbie in jquery. Do you know how to do the dpreview type theme for something like galleria? How much work is it?
[10:45:08] <scriabin> Mottie I'm thinking of a sandwich.  Which sandwich am I thinking of?
[10:45:15] <Mottie> reuben
[10:45:32] <Nocte> can anybody help me with little problem?
[10:45:47] <Cork> ?ask @ Nocte
[10:45:48] <bot-t> Nocte, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:45:50] <Darkstar1> I need help debugging why the scrollbar isn't appearing on this page: http://5.39.50.84/monassier/index.php?id=363
[10:45:50] <Mottie> codepython777: sorry, I have no idea, I've never used galleria
[10:46:02] <Darkstar1> it should appear left of the content area
[10:47:01] <codepython777> Mottie: what about doing the dpreview type album from scratch?
[10:47:15] <Mottie> Darkstar1: you can't move the built-in scroll bar, but you can simulate one with javascript... I didn't dig through your code, so I'm not sure what you are trying
[10:47:29] <Nocte> I'm trying to use the autocomplete with a remote mysql and php, the process is working well but it doesn't show the suggestions
[10:47:33] <Mottie> codepython777: that will take more time than I have
[10:48:01] <tomasm-> anyoe know why I get "object doesnt support this property or method" when I call jQuery(event).stopImmediatePropagation() In IE7? it works fine in firefox
[10:48:31] <Darkstar1> Mottie: not trying to move the built in scrollbar. I'm essentially using this: http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/ plugin and I've managed to make it work everywhere else except for this site. I'm at a loss as to why it just won't work on this site.
[10:49:02] <Darkstar1> Mottie: like it can't detect the height of the content so it disables scrolling by default
[10:49:52] <Nocte>  I'm trying to use the autocomplete with a remote mysql and php, the process is working well but it doesn't show the suggestions, what the hell can I do?
[10:49:53] <Darkstar1> styling on the class scroll_Area
[10:50:46] <Mottie> Darkstar1: where are you initializing the scroll bar?
[10:51:03] <chriys> i have a dream, the day that IE will never be used
[10:51:25] <Darkstar1> Mottie: on the document ready event
[10:51:26] <Mottie> http://www.saveie6.com/ !!!!
[10:51:27] <tomasm-> anyone know how I can convert a standard event object into the jquery (wrapped Event object) version?
[10:52:02] <Mottie> Darkstar1: which file? and maybe it would be better to put it inside a $(window).load() event
[10:52:33] <Darkstar1> Mottie: scrollEtude
[10:53:29] <johnkpaul> tomasm-: I am pretty sure you can just use new $.Event(eventObj)
[10:54:03] <tomasm-> johnkpaul, ah! i was stupidly using $(eventObj)
[10:54:27] <johnkpaul> tomasm-: ah, that's not stupid, you just didn't know
[10:54:37] <tomasm-> habot
[10:54:38] <tomasm-> habit
[10:54:39] <tomasm-> even
[10:54:42] <johnkpaul> tomasm-: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.7.2&fn=jQuery.Event
[10:54:47] <johnkpaul> bookmark the source viewier
[10:54:49] <johnkpaul> it's really useful
[10:56:40] <Darkstar1> Mottie: if you want to see it working I have it on another site
[10:57:23] <Mottie> Darkstar1: the height of scroll_area is only 100px... is the css loaded?
[10:57:55] <Darkstar1> Mottie: yeah. The css is loaded by jquery
[10:58:06] <Mottie> I don't see it
[10:58:14] <Mottie> I don't think
[10:58:39] <Nocte>  I'm trying to use the autocomplete with a remote mysql and php, the process is working well but it doesn't show the suggestions, what the hell can I do?
[10:59:41] <rhelic> I'm not seeing any links to jQ2 beta on the site, what's the URL?
[10:59:43] <rhelic> minifiied please
[11:00:18] <Darkstar1> Mottie: Thanks. You just gave me the missing semi-colon annuerism
[11:00:32] <Mottie> LOL sorry
[11:01:26] <shoky> rhelic http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.0b1.min.js
[11:03:17] <Darkstar1> 3 hours
[11:03:40] <Mottie> so that was it?
[11:04:21] <Darkstar1> Missing cSS
[11:04:39] <Mottie> YAY
[11:04:42] <rhelic> I got it
[11:04:48] <rhelic> shoky: oh thanks anyways :)
[11:05:07] <rhelic> I made the mistake of going to the download page, not to the blog
[11:09:06] <TelFiRE> Hey guys. I'm having troubles getting correct values from outerHeight. I am getting values that are far too small. But if I run the same code in the browser it does exactly what I want. Pretty simple code see here: http://pastebin.com/Bbcv99BX
[11:09:11] <djQuery> ?tell djdan .draggable({ helper: "clone", appendTo: "body" })
[11:09:12] <b-ot> djQuery: Iâ€™ll tell djdan about that.
[11:09:12] <bot-t> djQuery, Okay.
[11:12:20] <monk3y> TelFiRE: it *may* be the use of 'this'.
[11:12:36] <monk3y> I'm not 100% sure .. have you debugged what obj that is on each iteration?
[11:13:07] <TelFiRE> monk3y: but the $(this) works as expected with the exact same whole function run in browser
[11:13:13] <TelFiRE> console
[11:13:28] <TelFiRE> let me try logging it
[11:14:30] <monk3y> But .. the line that you say you run in the console; it doesn't reference 'this' in it.  It directly finds a 'div.front' child and calc's its outerheight.
[11:15:34] <TelFiRE> monk3y: no, the whole function run in browser
[11:15:36] <TelFiRE> the whole thing
[11:15:39] <TelFiRE> it has a this
[11:15:49] <chriys> how to verify opened port on my network and the one that my ISP blocked ?
[11:16:23] <monk3y> TelFiRE: ah right.
[11:16:35] <NoiseEee> chriys: not with jquery
[11:16:39] <TelFiRE> right now it's getting like, basically what seems to be about half value
[11:17:02] <TelFiRE> Did a console.log on this and it is the element I expect
[11:20:20] <Nocte> is anyone there?
[11:25:01] <Forbidd3n> Nocte: yep
[11:25:02] <Nocte> hi?
[11:25:21] <Forbidd3n> Nocte: what's up?
[11:25:34] <Nocte> Forbidd3n can you help me with an autocomplete problem?
[11:25:56] <gnarf> ?ask @Nocte
[11:25:57] <bot-t> Nocte, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:26:31] <TelFiRE> When the code runs on document.ready, I get values of 158, 180, and 130. When I run the VERBATIM code in console I get 293, 315, and 265. ZOMG! I'mma cry
[11:27:41] <Nocte> Ok, I'm making a form that works with an autocomplete field wich source is a php file that makes a query, the query works but it doesn't show the suggestions
[11:30:10] <TelFiRE> WHOA! It's a chrome bug >< *mind blown*
[11:31:10] <Forbidd3n> Nocte: how are you returning the result in?
[11:46:15] <sunbeam> when prettyphoto (jquery plugin) is showing the image. i like to avoid that pressing the left and right arrow is used to navigate other galleries/carousels
[11:46:18] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[11:49:33] <BillCriswell_> You want to remove functionality that you can't even tell exists really?
[11:53:20] <Nece228> hi
[11:54:05] <santamaria> Hi guys. Is it a known issue that using 'sortable' on nested lists causes multiple 'receive' events to be fired? Or is it an error on my part?
[11:56:15] <sunbeam> BillCriswell_: how do you mean?
[11:56:32] <BillCriswell_> Do you want to keep the keyboard from navigating the images?
[11:58:25] <jacta> I have a ul called id="categories" - inside that is li's with span tag inside, how to connect to spans? $("#categories > span") ?
[11:58:29] <jacta> seems not right :\
[11:58:32] <sunbeam> no, i just want the keyboard to navigate for prettyphoto only
[11:58:36] <sunbeam> when prettyphoto is showing
[11:58:59] <BillCriswell_> sunbeam: You don't want the arrows to show at all?
[11:59:00] <litenull> jacta: $("#categories > li > span") ?
[11:59:47] <jacta> nothing happens :\
[12:00:00] <jacta> $("#categories > li > span").click(function(){ console.log(1); });
[12:01:14] <jacta> there could be multiple ul's inside too - can I target a span with category_id as attribute instead?
[12:01:29] <jacta> <span class="folder" category_id="52">Vin</span> <-- this is an item i want to hit
[12:01:52] <chilversc> jacta: sure, just us a standard css attribute selector
[12:02:02] <NoiseEee> jacta: you should *really* have that attribute as "data-categoryid" but yes, you can
[12:02:23] <jacta> span[category_id=] ?
[12:02:25] <NoiseEee> $('[category_id="52"]')
[12:02:52] <jacta> but there are many spans with that, i want to fetch not only that one
[12:03:15] <chilversc> jacta: oh, so you want all the spans that have a category_id regardless of value?
[12:03:24] <jacta> true :
[12:03:26] <jacta> :)*
[12:04:18] <chilversc> jacta: then don't put = or a value in there
[12:04:47] <jacta> $('span[category_id]') --> like this?
[12:05:08] <chilversc> jacta: what happened when you tried it?
[12:05:40] <jacta> actually nothing happens :\
[12:06:15] <chilversc> jacta: odd, that should work
[12:06:26] <jacta> ill try again then
[12:06:51] <litenull> it works
[12:06:56] <litenull> :)
[12:07:42] <litenull> my example works too. where are you trying this stuff
[12:08:09] <jacta> Seems to work now, cleared cache :)
[12:08:54] <jacta> if I want to catch the category_id - is that something with $(this).val(ue)(?)
[12:09:05] <Nece228> how to find attribute?
[12:09:17] <nimzie> I'm pretty new to jquery and loving it. Trying to do something with clicking on a header and hide / show the list underneath - like an accordion. I have this code, and am wondering if someone could help me learn how to identify / bind each header to a click so that only its list shows / hides instead of all the lists firing at once? http://pastebin.com/w8H8KWwE
[12:09:20] <Gho5t> []
[12:10:03] <litenull> jacta: .attr('category_id')
[12:10:53] <chilversc> jacta: .val() would try and get the value from an input, you want .attr to get the value of a specific attribute
[12:11:46] <scar> can i use .attr() to retrieve any attribute? even one i made up? such as <img src="" slot="my_slot" id="img"> .. using $("#img").attr("slot"); -- i ask bc i tried this, and am not getting the value
[12:12:07] <litenull> yes
[12:12:26] <litenull> :)
[12:12:50] <scar> ok then i am def doing somethign wrong
[12:12:57] <scar> just making sure the answer wasnt "you cant do that"
[12:12:58] <scar> lol
[12:12:59] <scar> thanks
[12:17:12] <scar> should i use .ancestor() instead of .parent() if i want to get a level higher than the first parent
[12:17:13] <scar> ?
[12:17:34] <rasu> hello i have this line if(file_exists('session/'){... is it possible to check what path the function file_exists checks for? i have the dir session but it returns false
[12:17:50] <scar> rasu, ##php maybe?
[12:18:01] <rasu> oops wrong tab
[12:18:06] <scar> i do it all the time ;
[12:18:10] <litenull> hahahaha :)
[12:18:58] <Forbidd3n> OK, I have the regex working with digit and decimal, anyway to allow only one decimal?
[12:18:59] <Forbidd3n> str.replace(/[^0-9.]/g,'');
[12:19:13] <scar> litenull, are you aware? if i have .foo .bar .tab, how can i get the closest foo parent? $(".tab").parent(".foo") does not work
[12:19:59] <scar> Forbidd3n, you can replace the decimal in a separate step and compare the lengths
[12:20:03] <scar> if more than 1 char less, then boom
[12:20:21] <litenull> Forbidd3n: i suggest you to use http://refiddle.com/ useful tool
[12:20:32] <litenull> scar: lemme see your question
[12:20:33] <djQuery> oh wow VW 2012.2 is getting git support
[12:20:43] <djQuery> too bad I aint on windows no more
[12:21:04] <djQuery> besides being slow and crashy I liked it
[12:21:59] <litenull> scar: http://api.jquery.com/parent/ see the example
[12:22:55] <litenull> it does what you want t odo
[12:22:57] <litenull> to do*
[12:23:30] <scar> litenull, what about grandparents
[12:23:37] <scar> .parent() works for grandparents? i cant get it to work
[12:23:43] <nimzie> if I've got a page with header, list â€¦ header, list and I want to behave like an accordion, how would I go about binding header x with list x. currently I click any header, and all the lists toggle
[12:24:10] <NoiseEee> scar: http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:24:25] <scar> nimzie, would help to see your code. the accordion doc shows clearly how to designate a header lol
[12:24:42] <scar> NoiseEee, yeah i thought about using .closest() but figured there might be a different one menat for this
[12:24:44] <scar> such as ancestor
[12:24:48] <scar> idk :D
[12:24:48] <nimzie> scar - this code is output from the cmd, and I'm trying to play nicely http://pastebin.com/w8H8KWwE
[12:24:53] <nimzie> cmd=cms
[12:25:12] <scar> nimzie, i think you need the content wrapped in <div>
[12:25:32] <scar> wrap your <ul> into <div> and remove the <div> around each block
[12:25:59] <scar> <div class="item-list"></div> remove those, and enclose your <ul></ul> in <div>
[12:26:19] <litenull> scar: closest is the answer.
[12:26:40] <scar> nimzie, such as this: http://pastebin.com/FGBBmz2y
[12:26:45] <scar> k ty litenull NoiseEee
[12:26:46] <nimzie> scar - thanks, will try that .. I'm trying to write the jquery by hand and not use libraries
[12:26:57] <scar> nimzie, well, did you even LOOK at the accordion doc?
[12:27:10] <scar> ?ui.accordihttp://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[12:27:11] <nimzie> scar - I did .. and had it hooked up, kind of
[12:27:12] <bot-t> scar, Couldn't find "ui.accordihttp://jqueryui.com/accordion/" in jQuery Docs.
[12:27:23] <scar> nimzie, you diodnt follow the example at all then...
[12:27:24] <scar> lol

[12:27:50] <nimzie> scar - just working off html from the systemâ€¦ i'll try again. this is like my second day tooling with jq
[12:28:26] <nimzie> awesome, thanks scar, and Eviltwin .. appreciate the help. will study and apply :)
[12:28:28] <nimzie> ++
[12:30:52] <nimzie> eviltwin, thank you thank you thank you  .. I will be able to learn a lot from just that example.. it's been a banner couple of days, and I've done some cool things, but this is a key piece, as well as ajax bits (coming later to a brain near me!) ++
[12:42:48] <lil-murph> Using Deffered objects (in >= 1.8), is there an appropriate way to chain two ajax calls together (one-after-the-other). I've ended up with them nested which I feel is wrong: http://ideone.com/h4qhiy
[12:44:58] <thinboy> Hi, I used swipe.js to make in my mobile site slider. I want to make my slider images clickable, it seems that swipe.js wont allow click to work. Can anyone help me how to do that?
[12:45:30] <litenull> lil-murph: http://jsfiddle.net/sandhyasriraj/AaHZv/ ?
[12:45:58] <thinboy> *to make a slider
[12:46:54] <noregret> what pagination plugin is recommended ?
[12:49:47] <lil-murph> litenull: that seems unnecessarily complicated somehow.
[12:54:25] <lil-murph> I thought maybe I could do a $.when(differed_one).then(do_ajax_call_2), but that didn't seem to work (maybe it fired before the original .done and .fail's?)
[12:57:41] <lil-murph> oh wait, the when/then worked, i just had another bug.
[12:57:43] <lil-murph> cool.
[12:58:29] <litenull> lil-murph: your idea is ok
[12:59:12] <lil-murph> It's taken me all morning to get used to deffereds for some reason -_-
[12:59:19] <lil-murph> but I think i'm finally getting there.
[13:00:31] <litenull> happy for you :)
[13:07:07] <boink__> hi, I have a plugin (fancy box) with is returning a very unlikely mistake on its source code (f.browser is undefinedSource File: http://localhost/uli/js/jquery.fancybox.pack.jsLine: 5)  what could be wrong?
[13:07:38] <litenull> f.browser is undefined ? :)
[13:07:52] <boink__> hehe
[13:07:56] <litenull> :P
[13:08:10] <boink__> heap, but as I said, it seems unlikely that such a well known plugin would have that mistake
[13:08:28] <litenull> which jquery are you using
[13:08:28] <litenull> ?
[13:08:59] <boink__> latest  from code.jquery
[13:09:01] <litenull> see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[13:09:10] <litenull> its removed
[13:09:13] <litenull> browser
[13:09:30] <boink__> ahh okie
[13:09:38] <boink__> so my version of fancy box just became obsolete last week
[13:09:48] <litenull> i suggest you to use an older version
[13:09:59] <litenull> of jquery
[13:10:01] <boink__> yes, I guess I will have to do that
[13:10:17] <boink__> thanks, this has been driving me crazy for an hour and I naturally assumed it was my fault :)
[13:11:02] <litenull> when seeing errors think what you changed in the last revision
[13:11:13] <litenull> and ask here :)
[13:11:36] <boink__> I will. :) thanks again
[13:12:35] <thinboy> I implemented swipe.js into my mobile site slideshow but seems that it wont allow slider image link to be click. anyone knows how to solve that?
[13:12:48] <litenull> can you make a fiddle ?
[13:13:23] <thinboy> my fiddle is in written in other language. i cant understand it.
[13:13:41] <grafi> Ã´o
[13:14:11] <litenull> thinboy: change the class of the element to noSwipe which excludes elements of swipe
[13:14:15] <litenull> if this helps :))
[13:15:14] <thinboy> I did not get that. Can you explain that further?
[13:15:37] <litenull> your slideshow wrapper, add a class noSwipe
[13:15:45] <litenull> and tell me if it helps
[13:15:49] <thinboy> ok
[13:16:06] <thinboy> a second litenull
[13:22:54] <thinboy> litenull it does not work.
[13:23:06] <litenull> also create a class noSwipe in your style, did you do that ?
[13:24:41] <thinboy> litenull may I know what style attributes will I put on the the class .noSwipe {}
[13:25:11] <litenull> doesnt matter actually
[13:25:14] <litenull> just a sec
[13:26:07] <BillCriswell_> Whenever I use ems they bite me in the ass.
[13:30:07] <amh345> i've got a .ajaxStart .ajaxComplete showing an hiding a loader.  it seems to work pretty well for the most part.  only the .ajaxComplete executes as soon as it gets a response back, turning off the loader as soon as i get 'waiting for xyz.com' . is there something i can do to make sure the complete only executes when the page is about to be redirectect?
[13:30:41] <thinboy> litenulle Did not add any style on class noSwipe yet. Let me know what to put in there
[13:30:52] <thinboy> litenull
[13:30:58] <litenull> thinboy: im trying to recreate the problem sec
[13:31:09] <thinboy> okay
[13:31:17] <thinboy> litenull thanks
[13:31:20] <amh345> is a setTimeout the best way to fix this?  create a long time out that will close automatically when the page redirects?
[13:35:44] <bil`> var foo = (function(){â€¦}()  <-- does that run once when a is declared or every time foo is used?
[13:37:22] <gf3> bil`: Minus the syntax error, it runs once
[13:37:52] <bil`> cool thanks
[13:54:01] <theBrettman> how can I turn some html into a page with jquery mobile using code say like if it's already in a page cuz I'm using wordpress and so I end up making the html inside of another page. I don't see the methods for the page plugin in the docs
[13:56:55] <theBrettman> do I just use data-role="page" and then $.mobile.changePage()? cuz just using the data attribute isn't working
[13:58:18] <raygerrard> can you explain the problem a bit better?
[14:00:26] <theBrettman> wordpress has  a dynamic header and footer so the header for the page is in that file and the footer is in the footer file. in the content file, I want to make two other mobile pages. they're activate by a button but don't work
[14:01:02] <theBrettman> they have data-role="page" but they are already inside of another page with data-role="page" and I think that's why they won't work
[14:01:35] <theBrettman> I tried to appendTo('body'); on them but that works sometimes and sometimes it don't
[14:01:49] <theBrettman> I know there's some kind of page create method
[14:02:20] <theBrettman> so I'm thinking I could call that to turn the fragment into a page and it will automatically move it for me
[14:02:47] <theBrettman> just like it does when it uses ajax to fetch a page instead of loading the page
[14:02:54] <raygerrard> am i right that you would like the entire page to update instead of just the page content?
[14:02:56] <thinboy> litenull still there?
[14:03:10] <litenull> check pvt thinboy
[14:03:10] <theBrettman> no? I want a fragment turned into another page

[14:03:16] <b-ot> litenull: Issue #126 by stat30fbliss (3mon 4d ago): Buggy anchor link behavior in loaded slides
[14:03:22] <litenull> thats the issue
[14:03:43] <litenull> its a bug
[14:04:38] <thinboy> Can anyone help me how to implement click on swipe.js for my image slider? Currently it accepts swipe but does not accept click. I already added a href to my images.
[14:05:04] <litenull> thinboy: i just replied to you :) its a bug
[14:05:09] <litenull> https://github.com/bradbirdsall/Swipe/issues/126 check this
[14:05:10] <b-ot> litenull: Issue #126 by stat30fbliss (3mon 4d ago): Buggy anchor link behavior in loaded slides
[14:08:33] <raygerrard> you would need to have multiple pages, header content and footer in the same template
[14:09:01] <raygerrard> give each page an id and then link to them by hashlink
[14:10:19] <theBrettman> I know there's a way to do it by fragment but I just don't understand how yet
[14:11:06] <raygerrard> what do you ran by fragment?
[14:11:13] <raygerrard> mean
[14:11:25] <raygerrard> just the page content?
[14:13:38] <litenull> theBrettman: are you saying you want to change to the dynamically created page ?
[14:13:52] <litenull> you could use : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6050384/dynamically-create-jquery-mobile-page-via-javascript-after-clicking
[14:14:43] <theBrettman> I'm saying, I've created with php another fragment, a div with an id and data-role="page" attribute. then there is a button to activate it. but it's inside of another page...
[14:14:51] <theBrettman> it's inside the page I'm on
[14:14:58] <theBrettman> and it's not working when I click the button
[14:15:08] <theBrettman> I think because it's inside of the page
[14:15:13] <litenull> check the example and fire the create when the dom is ready
[14:15:14] <theBrettman> when I put it outside the page, it works
[14:15:19] <litenull> oh, ok
[14:15:21] <litenull> :D
[14:15:40] <theBrettman> so I want to run a function on that fragment so that jquery mobile moves it for me
[14:16:15] <raygerrard> oh ok brettman
[14:16:19] <theBrettman> with it's method to create pages like when it retrieves the data attribute or when it does an ajax call and injects the html into the page
[14:16:30] <raygerrard> you are looking to trigger the create event on it
[14:17:20] <theBrettman> http://ampac.brettwilliamson.info/testers/elongation-testers/nova-112/
[14:17:30] <theBrettman> I think that's what I need to do
[14:17:37] <theBrettman> going to test it in the console
[14:17:44] <raygerrard> if you are manipulating widgets that have already been mobilised you would trigger refresh on the page, if you are adding new elements you should trigger create
[14:17:45] <theBrettman> id="photos"
[14:18:03] <theBrettman> well it has to be added
[14:18:40] <thinboy> theBrettman do you know how to do it?
[14:18:46] <theBrettman> if I do jQuery.mobile.changePage('#photos'); I get undefined
[14:19:09] <litenull> photos div is undefined
[14:19:17] <raygerrard> .trigger("create")
[14:19:30] <theBrettman> maybe jQuery.mobile.createPage('#photos'); ?
[14:20:03] <theBrettman> so jQuery('#photos').trigger('create');?
[14:20:28] <litenull> there is no photos div in your dom ?
[14:20:34] <theBrettman> yes there is
[14:21:03] <theBrettman> it has the data-role="page" but it's not turning it into a page
[14:21:19] <raygerrard> did you trigger create on the page?
[14:22:20] <litenull> well i cant see it, i did a search and theres no photos..
[14:22:21] <theBrettman> yes but it still don't work
[14:22:50] <theBrettman> I see it just fine
[14:23:42] <theBrettman> it's in the div#content
[14:24:06] <theBrettman> there's also #videos
[14:24:12] <thinboy> litenull are you talking to me?
[14:24:31] <litenull> no, to theBrettman
[14:24:53] <jamiejackson> Datepicker: i'd like the datepicker to populate its input onClose. what's the normal way to do this? here's my cheesy start: http://jsfiddle.net/5SuL2/1/
[14:25:21] <thinboy> litenull I see. Have you continued checking about my issue?
[14:25:22] <theBrettman> right click on the photos button and inspect element. scroll down and see 2 divs
[14:26:21] <raygerrard> brettman can you put a fiddle up, this will be easier
[14:28:03] <litenull> yolo :)
[14:29:05] <theBrettman> no, that won't be easier, lol
[14:29:12] <theBrettman> how would it be any easier?
[14:29:22] <litenull> http://ampac.brettwilliamson.info/testers/elongation-testers/nova-112/
[14:29:26] <litenull> on this link
[14:29:35] <litenull> where is the photos button
[14:29:35] <litenull> ?
[14:29:43] <theBrettman> the button with the camera icon
[14:29:52] <theBrettman> below description
[14:30:17] <raygerrard> sorry didn't see the link
[14:30:24] <theBrettman> it's ok
[14:37:20] <raygerrard> when i click the image button i get a new page with your image
[14:38:12] <theBrettman> sometimes it works, sometimes it don't cuz I have $('#photos').appendTo('body'); in .ready()
[14:38:31] <raygerrard> you don't want it in doc ready
[14:38:50] <theBrettman> oh yeah, lol
[14:38:53] <theBrettman> duh
[14:39:03] <raygerrard> $(document).bind("pageinit", yourFunc);
[14:39:22] <theBrettman> still, moving it with .appendTo isn't really the right way to do it
[14:39:34] <thinboy> Does anyone knows how to make image links work with swipe.js? Im using it in a slider.
[14:39:40] <theBrettman> how can I turn that fragment into a page?
[14:40:08] <raygerrard> $("#page").trigger("create");
[14:40:27] <raygerrard> after you inject it
[14:40:30] <raygerrard> not in ready
[14:40:35] <theBrettman> I tried that in consule, it didn't work
[14:40:39] <theBrettman> *console
[14:40:55] <litenull> do this on init
[14:40:58] <raygerrard> did you then change page after?
[14:41:09] <theBrettman> yes and it didn't work
[14:41:37] <theBrettman> I tried clicking the button and I tried jQuery('#photos').changePage();
[14:41:52] <raygerrard> its working every time for me
[14:42:23] <theBrettman> TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'changePage'
[14:43:03] <litenull> $.mobile.changePage('#photos')
[14:43:18] <devslash> is there a way to prepend js into the beginning of a page instead of appending it to the end using .append ?
[14:43:21] <raygerrard> $.mobile.changePage
[14:43:39] <raygerrard> prepend
[14:43:51] <devslash> .prepend
[14:43:51] <litenull> $.mobile.changePage('#photos', 'pop', false, true)
[14:43:54] <devslash> ?
[14:44:50] <litenull> also do a $('#homeDIV div[data-role="content"]').page(); to refresh the css
[14:45:58] <litenull> does it work ?
[14:50:14] <theBrettman> still get undefined when I use changePage
[14:50:34] <litenull> hmm
[14:50:42] <litenull> thats strange
[14:51:36] <raygerrard> what if you do jQuery.mobile.changePage('#photos');
[14:52:10] <theBrettman> ha, my script isn't being imported, lol
[14:52:19] <theBrettman> I neeed to put it  in the page
[14:52:24] <litenull> grrrr
[14:52:25] <litenull> :)
[14:52:31] <litenull> lol
[14:52:34] <theBrettman> how do I make that page load hard?
[14:52:39] <theBrettman> that and the first page
[14:52:45] <theBrettman> that will fix everything
[14:53:09] <theBrettman> as in do a real page load on those pages
[14:53:45] <theBrettman> and maybe I should've been using loadPage?
[14:54:32] <litenull> i actually dont understand your question :)
[14:54:45] <litenull> you mean how to inject your script ?
[14:55:27] <raygerrard> makes two of us
[14:55:29] <TonkaTruck> MediaElement.JS!  Any y'all know how to access the player instance via the video tag?  Ain't nothin in data() jackasses.
[14:56:19] <litenull> is this channel turning in some pirate bay at this time ?
[14:56:26] <TonkaTruck> MediaElement is all "ooh look at me I'm responsive" but doesn't properly observe changes to parent box via css media queries.
[14:57:33] <theBrettman> my script will load if I do a hard load of the page. if you went to the home page and hit refresh and then navigate to that tester page, you'll see gallery.js is missing. hit refresh and it appears
[14:57:47] <theBrettman> because I'm loading it with wordpress
[14:58:10] <theBrettman> there's an option to make it not fetch that page with ajax but do a hard load instead
[14:58:25] <litenull> TonkaTruck: $('video, audio') ?
[14:58:34] <raygerrard> data-ajax="false"
[14:58:38] <theBrettman> thx
[14:58:41] <TonkaTruck> ack!
[14:59:08] <theBrettman> I'll have to build that into the home button too
[15:00:02] <theBrettman> damn, gonna have to add that with a script, lol
[15:00:19] <litenull> where is the problem of <script> ?
[15:00:24] <theBrettman> cuz the page is dynamic
[15:00:37] <litenull> you dont have a wp template or someth ?
[15:00:40] <theBrettman> oh, I just would rather load that page anyway
[15:00:47] <TonkaTruck> jesus christ I figured it out.  $("video")[0].load() redraws the player.
[15:00:59] <litenull> TonkaTruck: yep
[15:01:26] <theBrettman> I also want to reset the history on the home page so that they can exit easier using the phone's back button
[15:01:35] <theBrettman> I already know how to do that tho
[15:01:58] <litenull> :)
[15:02:25] <theBrettman> history.back(history.length); history.replaceState(history.state); or something like that
[15:05:35] <TonkaTruck> litenull: thanks homes.
[15:05:43] <litenull> np
[15:06:32] <TonkaTruck> Now, does anyone know what to tell a client that thinks every break point in a responsive layout deserves 400 design feedback iterations?
[15:06:57] <raygerrard> on your own there
[15:06:58] <tfitts> More $$$?
[15:07:17] <TonkaTruck> tfitts: Yeah, I'm basically going to charge per breakpoint from now on.
[15:10:05] <litenull> TonkaTruck: aggree
[15:10:06] <litenull> :))
[15:10:21] <litenull> agree
[15:10:21] <litenull> *
[15:11:49] <theBrettman> oh, I can put data-ajax="false" on the links! that makes life easier
[15:12:33] <theBrettman> crap, stupid wordpress. can't do that either
[15:12:53] <theBrettman> they need to make it so you can add data attributes to stuff
[15:13:21] <litenull> add them via jquery ? :)))
[15:13:34] <litenull> jk
[15:36:41] <guide_X> anyone know how to build a custom button into prettyphoto
[15:36:48] <guide_X> that I can reach with my own jquery code
[15:37:19] <guide_X> I have my custom html in the popup, but I wish to do something when someone clicks a button with jquery
[15:42:49] <xboi209> What's the pure javascript equivalent of jQuery's .before()?
[15:44:49] <systemfault> insertBefore
[15:45:13] <systemfault> There's no perfect equivalent thoughâ€¦ as jquery is higher level
[15:45:30] <jrajav> In particular, insertBefore only works on a single Node
[15:45:42] <xboi209> :/
[15:45:50] <systemfault> Of course.
[15:46:01] <systemfault> Just use jquery..
[15:46:13] <systemfault> Or any other lib.
[15:46:36] <xboi209> well
[15:46:47] <xboi209> I wanted to use pure javascript to quickly add something to a page
[15:46:52] <systemfault> lol
[15:46:55] <xboi209> as if it were originally part of the pagre
[15:47:02] <xboi209> so that stuff won't get pushed down
[15:47:04] <xboi209> when loading
[15:47:21] <jrajav> It won't be any "quicker" with vanilla, at least not in any fundamental way
[15:47:25] <systemfault> "pure javascript" and "quickly add" are mutually exclusive.
[15:47:38] <xboi209> ._.
[15:47:57] <systemfault> pure javascript/dom is verbose..
[15:48:00] <xboi209> I was assuming jQuery is slightly slower than pure javascvript, am i wrong?
[15:48:52] <jrajav> You're not wrong, but the overhead in this case is going to come from the fact that you *have* to wait for the DOM to be ready before you can traverse and manipulate it. Oh, and then you have to traverse and manipulate it
[15:49:03] <jrajav> What jQuery adds on top of that will not be enough to notice
[15:49:52] <fede> hi
[15:49:53] <jrajav> We're talking in precise terms here, by the way - in all likelihood you will not actually SEE it happen. Particularly on desktop.
[15:49:58] <jrajav> It depends on how much you're adding, though
[15:50:07] <xboi209> Just some simple text I'm adding
[15:50:17] <xboi209> I'm just trying to find a way to prevent the page from being pushed down
[15:50:44] <xboi209> it's like not adding width and height tags to image elements, the page gets pushed down when the image starts loading
[15:51:03] <jrajav> Well, you can do it with vanilla, it may be worth a try. We're just forewarning you that it's not likely to be a silver bullet.
[15:51:23] <jrajav> You would start by getting the elements in question somehow - easiest way if you don't need old browsers would be querySelector(All).
[15:51:28] <jrajav> Then loop over them and insertBefore
[15:51:46] <xboi209> document.getelementbyid?
[15:51:49] <xboi209> what about that?
[15:51:51] <jrajav> That would work too
[15:58:10] <jedimind> if i have a nested json object how do i make an array of all objects' nested specific value
[15:58:20] <jedimind> ... if thats not english, i dont know what is
[15:59:01] <jedimind> http://pastie.org/5976207 i want to $.getJSON and return an array of just tags.title
[15:59:04] <jedimind> but my brain is borked
[15:59:53] <systemfault> Just iterateâ€¦ $.map would be a perfect candidate for that.
[16:00:17] <TonkaTruck> There's something really funny about Safari failing to play an mp4 that Chrome plays without a problem hahaha.
[16:08:29] <jtal> if I myStuff.html(allKindsOfStuff)
[16:08:39] <jtal> are the elements in allKindsOfStuff in DOM?
[16:08:48] <jtal> i.e. accessible with jquery selectors
[16:11:35] <aghouseh> anyone know offhand if its possible to override the default configuration for jquery tooltips globally?
[16:11:48] <aghouseh> save from editing the source, of course :p
[16:39:34] <coldhead> and watch the waves and move the fader
[17:07:57] <BryanRuiz_> I have an inline style with a z-index:10 ;   but for some reason, this is returning auto
[17:07:58] <BryanRuiz_> $j(images[x]).parent().css('z-index'));
[17:08:50] <BryanRuiz_> it would be <a style="z-index:10;"><img></a>
[17:18:22] <BryanRuiz_> typo
[17:31:17] <jrockjiggz> i'm facing an interesting problem where if i'm trying to add <form> element inside a <form> jQuery.html() strips <form>
[17:31:50] <systemfault> Then don't do something stupid?
[17:32:21] <systemfault> It's HTML basics...
[17:32:42] <jrockjiggz> systemfault: html?
[17:32:49] <BryanRuiz_> whats html?
[17:32:51] <BryanRuiz_> :)
[17:32:54] <jrockjiggz> ;o
[17:33:03] <systemfault> Yeahâ€¦ basic HTML, forms cannot be nested.
[17:33:07] <jrockjiggz> I replicated the issue with console.log http://jsfiddle.net/9Sc6v/
[17:33:29] <jrockjiggz> yo dawg.. i heard you like forms
[17:33:51] <jrockjiggz> so we put a form inside a form so you can submit your form while filling out a form
[17:34:16] <jrockjiggz> badum-tsh
[17:34:29] <systemfault> Why are you trying to do it if it's stupid?
[17:34:52] <jrockjiggz> not my code.. now i gotta fix it
[17:35:22] <jrockjiggz> the idea is if user selects 'other' from a dropdown, another form loads in place for you to fill in and submit
[17:35:54] <jrockjiggz> its interesting that it works the first time, but upon clearing the container div, and loading in the form, the 2nd time the <form> tags are stripped
[17:37:02] <BryanRuiz_> what am I doing wrong here? alert($('a').css('z-index'));
[17:37:04] <BryanRuiz_> er
[17:37:18] <BryanRuiz_> http://jsfiddle.net/vLA6S/3/
[17:37:30] <BryanRuiz_> i cant seem to get an inline css property
[17:37:58] <jrockjiggz> BryanRuiz_?
[17:38:01] <systemfault> BryanRuiz_: Your sample works fine here.
[17:38:12] <BryanRuiz_> it returns auto instead of 10
[17:39:10] <systemfault> It returns 10 in your testcase.
[17:39:16] <BryanRuiz_> weird
[17:39:22] <jrockjiggz> for me it returns auto
[17:40:11] <systemfault> Hmm.. auto on chrome, 10 on firefox
[17:40:28] <BryanRuiz_> isnt that awesome
[17:40:34] <BryanRuiz_> i got another way i think
[17:40:42] <BryanRuiz_> this.style.zIndex
[17:41:27] <systemfault> If you do something less stupid than setting z-index on a element with static positioning.. it works on both http://jsfiddle.net/vLA6S/4/
[17:41:55] <jrockjiggz> BryanRuiz_: http://jsfiddle.net/vLA6S/5/
[17:41:58] <BryanRuiz_> i wouldnt say stupid
[17:42:02] <jrockjiggz> position: relative; is required
[17:42:07] <BryanRuiz_> got it, thanks guys
[17:42:14] <systemfault> BryanRuiz_: z-index with static positioning is stupid.
[17:42:23] <systemfault> (It doesn't work)
[17:42:26] <BryanRuiz_> i havent got to the css stuff yet, saving that for last
[17:42:29] <BryanRuiz_> now i know
[17:42:46] <systemfault> You'll write bad jquery if you don't know CSS.
[17:43:04] <BryanRuiz_> i mean i started writing the jquery before i styled in css
[17:43:12] <systemfault> Ahh ok
[17:43:27] <BryanRuiz_> thanks
[17:46:26] <BryanRuiz_> alriight lets see if i can get help with this..
[17:47:26] <BryanRuiz_> notice inside here, I set thisClass = this
[17:47:33] <BryanRuiz_> https://gist.github.com/26926ae637e453a429b0
[17:47:59] <Marcky> how come I cant do this : http://jsfiddle.net/5qbMf/6/
[17:48:06] <BryanRuiz_> this way I can store the zIndex, and then recall it in mouseout of hover
[17:48:21] <BryanRuiz_> but it doesnt work
[17:48:29] <BryanRuiz_> im not sure what concept im not grasping
[17:49:48] <otherj> can anyone give me a hint as to why my add/remove class isn't working here? https://gist.github.com/c49e21a31dee1d0c93cd
[17:49:56] <otherj> i'm trying to show a div when the upload starts and hide it when it finishes
[17:50:02] <otherj> but it never shows it
[17:51:06] <grafi> because you "instantly" .addClass('hidden') again?!
[17:52:09] <otherj> i realize that, but i'm not sure how to better to tie it to the upload completing
[17:54:18] <Marcky> can anyone help me o.O
[17:54:49] <otherj> man, i get the feeling that i need to be using textual or linkinus
[17:58:38] <grafi> otherj doesnt load() have a complete callback? why not put it there?
[17:58:42] <vitor-br> Guys, I'm using jquery ui 1.9.2 and custom classes of dialog buttons are not being applied
[17:59:31] <jrockjiggz> vitor-br: thanks for sharing
[17:59:47] <BryanRuiz_> ... does jquery pass strings by reference?
[17:59:49] <BryanRuiz_> :-x
[18:00:56] <otherj> yeah, but i think i'd need some kind of start() to remove the class first if i do it this way?
[18:01:07] <vitor-br> jrockjiggz, What might be happening? This is a known bug?
[18:01:27] <grafi> that would be the click event?
[18:01:33] <AtomicDog> Can anyone please tell me how, during the drop: callback, can I tell what the dropped element used to be dropped into before it was moved to this?
[18:01:40] <grafi> which you are already using to remove the class
[18:01:41] <AtomicDog> Of Draggable
[18:01:49] <raj> gets always loop through multiple selected items or sets? ...like if I run a get/set method on $('.someclass')
[18:01:54] <otherj> let me try it
[18:02:04] <AtomicDog> Objects are always references
[18:02:04] <otherj> something nags at me that i can't use th ecallbackm which is why i didn't
[18:02:12] <AtomicDog> "stringds" are always values
[18:03:21] <otherj> wouldn't it be like this? https://gist.github.com/c49e21a31dee1d0c93cd
[18:04:05] <jrockjiggz> vitor-br: http://jeff.jones.be/technology/articles/how-to-ask-for-help-on-irc/
[18:04:38] <AtomicDog> Can anyone please tell me how, during the drop: callback, can I tell what the dropped element used to be dropped into before it was moved to this?
[18:05:03] <jrockjiggz> vitor-br: basically, i have no idea what you are doing, your statement is very unhelpful when asking for help
[18:07:02] <vitor-br> jrockjiggz, sorry
[18:07:19] <jrockjiggz> np :)
[18:07:22] <otherj> oh, i just need to leave the first arg blank
[18:08:00] <otherj> do I really want .load(function(){}.function(){ â€¦ my stuff â€¦); though? seems like i should be able to omit that first function
[18:09:10] <raj> jrockjiggz, what do you call it when you have multiple items with a selector?
[18:09:20] <raj> looping?
[18:09:58] <jrockjiggz> ?
[18:10:19] <jrockjiggz> you can iterate a jquery object with each() if its necessary
[18:11:25] <PineappleCLock> is there any way in firefox or chrome to find out what jquery events are attached to a certain DOM object
[18:12:22] <vitor-br> When I create buttons in dialog, the classes of the buttons are not being applied. https://gist.github.com/4679355
[18:12:41] <jrockjiggz> PineappleCLock: i recommend visual events bookmarklet http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[18:23:18] <BryanRuiz_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14617381/why-is-my-private-variable-changing-here any help with this is appreciated
[18:53:18] <thinboy> I just use flex slider on my WP site but why is it that my slider images dont swipe just like what is on the demo page. It just fades and moves to next image when being swipe (on mobile)
[18:54:05] <thinboy> And this code does not work on my site: $(window).load(function() {
[18:54:06] <thinboy>   $('.flexslider').flexslider({
[18:54:06] <thinboy>     animation: "slide"
[18:54:06] <thinboy>   });
[18:54:06] <thinboy> });
[18:55:28] <thinboy> But this works: $(window).load(function() {
[18:55:29] <thinboy>  
[18:55:29] <thinboy>     	//simple FlexSlider call
[18:55:29] <thinboy>     	$('.flexslider').flexslider();
[18:55:29] <thinboy> 		
[18:55:29] <thinboy>   	});
[18:57:23] <tw2113> the last one uses defaults, the first one you try to pass in a custom setting
[18:57:29] <tw2113> did you check your console for errors?
[18:58:11] <thinboy> hmmm
[18:59:11] <tw2113> when dealing with js, the console is your husband/wife
[18:59:22] <tw2113> if you're legally married to a human, they're aiding you in cheating
[19:00:23] <thinboy> tw2113 There are few errors on console but it does not deal with the code i am referring. what do you think is the problem?
[19:01:28] <tw2113> thinboy, this would be an issue http://dev.pietysurfboards.com/wp-content/themes/PhotopurePress/js/jquery.min.js
[19:01:41] <tw2113> 404ing
[19:01:59] <tw2113> and fuck..should have chopped off the main url
[19:02:19] <tw2113> sorry for that part
[19:02:38] <otherj> nutty ol' wordpress
[19:04:28] <thinboy> hmmm. thats bad you should have cut the url. but its okay.
[19:11:10] <thinboy> tw2113 I dont know what is the cause of that error.
[19:13:01] <sparuvu> hey guysâ€¦. quick questionâ€¦â€¦ what is the best way (DIVs vs Tables) to present a very large dataset in html. And also I need to do some jQuery animations on the rows
[19:13:18] <jrockjiggz> tables
[19:13:27] <sparuvu> if I use tables does the animations work well
[19:13:36] <jrockjiggz> you can
[19:13:40] <sparuvu> http://jsfiddle.net/FSGuK/2/
[19:13:52] <sparuvu> I created this fiddle where tables doesnt animate well
[19:14:47] <jrockjiggz> oh man. class="div" ? lol
[19:15:33] <sparuvu> hehehehe just for the fiddle bro
[19:17:24] <b1lly> sparuvu: animations dont work on tables
[19:17:48] <sparuvu> b1lly: man that sucks
[19:18:05] <sparuvu> but my company people are killing me to use tables
[19:18:25] <b1lly> well
[19:18:27] <b1lly> you can use fade
[19:18:29] <b1lly> just not slides
[19:19:04] <b1lly> you can wrap your table td elements in divs? maybe
[19:19:32] <sparuvu> hmmmmm
[19:20:34] <b1lly> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/467336/jquery-how-to-use-slidedown-or-show-function-on-a-table-row
[19:20:39] <b1lly> look at response #14
[19:23:51] <BryanRuiz_> hm
[19:24:19] <BryanRuiz_> i want to cancel a mouse out event if the person clicks the element and do something else, is that possible?
[19:24:28] <raj> what's the best way to select an element in an array?
[19:24:47] <BryanRuiz_> nvm i got a better idea
[19:25:04] <raj> a jquery object, I should say
[19:25:15] <raj> what is the best way to select a jquery object in an array?
[19:25:27] <raj> I want to use classes
[19:25:35] <raj> to select
[19:25:38] <jrockjiggz> b1lly: cool it works http://jsfiddle.net/FSGuK/4/
[19:25:45] <jrockjiggz> sparuvu: ^^
[19:25:58] <raj> $.inArray is the best way?
[19:26:02] <raj> any alternates?
[19:26:10] <b1lly> raj: what do you mean
[19:26:36] <b1lly> you want to iterate through an array and check for jquery object?
[19:26:45] <jrockjiggz> raj(jqueryObject).find('el')
[19:26:49] <raj> oh, so I have to iterate?
[19:26:55] <b1lly> raj: i'm asking
[19:26:57] <raj> jrockjiggz, the jqueryObject is what I'm looking for
[19:26:58] <b1lly> I dont understand the question
[19:27:09] <jrockjiggz> $(jqueryobject).find('el')
[19:27:29] <thinboy> In flex slider: Why is complex call wont work? $(window).load(function() {
[19:27:30] <thinboy>   $('.flexslider').flexslider({
[19:27:30] <thinboy>     animation: "slide"
[19:27:30] <thinboy>   });
[19:27:30] <thinboy> });
[19:27:31] <sparuvu> jrockjiggz: seriously â€¦ it takes that much code to animate a table row
[19:27:33] <raj> if I have $(data), which has 4 divs at the same level, of which 2 have the same class
[19:27:54] <sparuvu> anyways thanks and definetely helps me to switch to divs
[19:28:05] <jrockjiggz> sparuvu: its a plugin, you include it once.
[19:28:09] <b1lly> sparuvu: the example uses without divs
[19:28:40] <raj> so data is = [<div class='thing'>...</div>, <div class='thing'>...</div>, <div class='thing2'>...</div>, <div class='thing2'>...</div>]
[19:28:54] <raj> sorry $(data) is equal to that
[19:29:06] <raj> and i want to select 'thing'
[19:29:09] <raj> both of them
[19:29:18] <raj> .find('.thing') won't work
[19:29:18] <b-ot> raj: @work: RT @dtrinh: The Lonely Island - YOLO (feat. Adam Levine & Kendrick Lamar) http://t.co/lv0Y4TOM
[19:29:20] <raj> because it's top level
[19:29:35] <jrockjiggz> filter()
[19:29:44] <raj> really?
[19:29:59] <jroes> hey guys, trying to use a div as like a "viewport" or "canvas" almost - so I'm adding elements to it and moving them around. I want to write a function called "focusTo()" that basically just moves the screen so that a particular div is the center. anyone have any advice on how to accomplish this?
[19:30:00] <raj> yeah, that works
[19:30:12] <raj> nice
[19:30:13] <raj> thanks jrockjiggz
[19:30:35] <b1lly> try $(data).find('.thing') ?
[19:30:43] <b1lly> oh
[19:31:24] <b1lly> yeah, iterate through it
[19:32:47] <jrockjiggz> jroes: i would think to keep your canvase inside a <div> and hide the scrollbars, and then find the elements x,y values and scrollTo that position
[19:33:27] <L1> Anyone know how to access the window object, when I appear to be stuck with jquerys local cached copy?  http://jsfiddle.net/u4Tkx/
[19:33:39] <raj> b1lly, filter is cleaner
[19:33:44] <raj> iterates for me
[19:33:55] <b1lly> i agreew
[19:34:23] <b1lly> L1 you should still have access to window.ko from inside that function
[19:35:38] <L1> b1lly: Any suggestions why it is crashing on me then? "Cannot call applyBindings on undefined" (window.ko.applyBindings(model))
[19:37:07] <L1> I can type "window.ko" into the dev tools console at any time and see the object, /except/ inside that event
[19:37:32] <jroes> jrockjiggz: you talking about scrollTop or the jQuery.scrollTo plugin?
[19:38:03] <RA3OR> $(this).closest('input').attr('value'); whats wrong here?
[19:38:15] <RA3OR> its an input type hidden
[19:38:22] <tfittsy> is there an easy way to post a form that contains a multiple select using ajax?
[19:38:53] <tfittsy> if I .serialize() the form I get param=Value1&param=Value2&param=Value3 so when it posts I only get param=Value3
[19:39:02] <jrockjiggz> jroes: havent done anything like that
[19:39:02] <b1lly> tfittsy:  look at .submit()
[19:39:17] <jroes> jrockjiggz: np
[19:39:19] <b1lly> tfittsy: oh you mean with ajax
[19:39:36] <tfittsy> yeah
[19:39:55] <b1lly> serialization doesnt do it?
[19:40:05] <jrockjiggz> tfittsy: you should be able to data: $(this).serialize()
[19:40:10] <RA3OR> $(".formDeleteNote").submit(function(event) { wont give me params, but $("#formDeleteNote").submit will
[19:40:36] <RA3OR> problem is, i cant use #id, because its a #id<integer here>
[19:40:49] <tfittsy> jrockjiggz: see my above comment about .serialize();
[19:41:27] <jrockjiggz> tfittsy: paste?
[19:41:33] <tfittsy> if I .serialize() the form I get param=Value1&param=Value2&param=Value3 so when it posts I only get param=Value3
[19:42:05] <jrockjiggz> RA3OR: $('#formId').submit() will
[19:42:06] <tfittsy> I'm specifically asking about a multiple select.  serialize() repeats the same parameter instead of doing param[]= or something
[19:42:47] <RA3OR> jrockjiggz: i have a dynamic $('#formId<id here>').submit()
[19:42:49] <jrockjiggz> tfittsy: <select name="name[]"> ?
[19:43:34] <RA3OR> its a table where action is <form id=thisid<+int, autoincrement>....
[19:43:49] <RA3OR> i have multiple forms
[19:43:55] <jrockjiggz> RA3OR: this is a a sorts of hack, but you can $('form').find('[id^=formId]'). //^ starts with
[19:43:56] <RA3OR> through which i want to delete
[19:43:57] <tfittsy> jrockjiggz: brilliant! can't believe I didn't think of that.
[19:44:19] <tfittsy> thanks
[19:44:26] <jrockjiggz> np :)
[19:44:42] <RA3OR> tfittsy: also use multiple=multiple
[19:44:51] <RA3OR> if needed
[19:45:35] <RA3OR> jrockjiggz: any other solution?
[19:45:47] <jrockjiggz> $('[id^=formId]','form') //cleaner
[19:46:35] <jrockjiggz> RA3OR: can this form submit like a normal page, or are you preventing default behavior?
[19:46:42] <RA3OR> question: why doesnt $(".formDeleteNote").submit(function(event) { submt the form params?
[19:46:54] <RA3OR> im preventing it
[19:47:05] <jrockjiggz> RA3OR: i don't see why it wouldnt?
[19:47:06] <RA3OR> thru html post works perfect
[19:48:14] <RA3OR> jrockjiggz: ?
[19:48:40] <RA3OR> thru class name it doesnt pass the params to $.post
[19:49:13] <jrockjiggz> RA3OR: http://jsfiddle.net/uVdCR/1/
[19:49:35] <RA3OR> jrockjiggz ?
[19:49:40] <RA3OR> wait, ill paste mine
[19:52:10] <jedimind> silly question, maybe more #javascript related

[19:53:37] <jedimind> coldhead, i like it when its ankle hih
[19:53:38] <jedimind> high
[19:55:06] <amh345> $(this).attr({ "rel": "true"});  got it.

[19:57:07] <RA3OR> i hope it makes any sense
[19:58:39] <jrockjiggz> RA3OR: it working here http://jsfiddle.net/uVdCR/3/
[19:59:08] <RA3OR> err, what?
[19:59:44] <RA3OR> jrockjiggz: what works there? the post?

[20:01:42] <RA3OR> jrockjiggz: i have a set of forms in a table, i want to be able to $.post thru my function, this way : ajaxCall('deleteNote'); with note_id param to serialize, NOT ajaxCall('deleteNote<randomID>')
[20:02:06] <RA3OR> have to ask
[20:02:22] <RA3OR> having multiple <form id='myId'... is bad
[20:02:24] <RA3OR> right?
[20:02:46] <jrockjiggz> no its fine, as long as their not embedded
[20:03:06] <RA3OR> and $(".formDeleteNote").submit(function(event) { doesnt give me the params
[20:03:14] <jrockjiggz> this depends on how ajaxCall() works
[20:03:23] <RA3OR> but $("WformDeleteNote").submit(function(event) { will
[20:03:28] <RA3OR> W=#
[20:04:41] <RA3OR> ajaxCall grabs the 'deleteNote<randomID>' and posts it to my.php, where i have if (isset($_POST['deleteNote'])) {
[20:04:53] <RA3OR> i cant have if (isset($_POST['deleteNote<IDs here>'])) {
[20:05:55] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/gnfxF/1/
[20:05:56] <RA3OR> $("#formDeleteNote<+anyIDhere>").submit would work for me
[20:05:59] <jrockjiggz> not really seeing the issue
[20:06:45] <RA3OR> i know it works, but php doesnt get the note_id
[20:06:53] <RA3OR> in html post it does
[20:06:58] <RA3OR> thru jquery it doesnt
[20:07:30] <RA3OR> because .submit(function(event) { works with ID not with class
[20:07:40] <RA3OR> bah
[20:07:47] <jrockjiggz> it does. that isnt your issue
[20:08:07] <jrockjiggz> you haven't shared how saveAjax works
[20:08:18] <RA3OR> hmm
[20:08:19] <jrockjiggz> ajaxCall()
[20:08:21] <RA3OR> this is it
[20:08:22] <RA3OR> 	var formID = '#form'+ucfirst(whatFor);
[20:08:22] <RA3OR> 	var serializedData = $(formID).serialize();
[20:08:25] <RA3OR> the problem
[20:08:29] <RA3OR> hardcoded
[20:08:35] <RA3OR> crap
[20:08:54] <RA3OR> hold on
[20:11:50] <MeMReS> Hello everyone
[20:13:02] <RA3OR> oh snap
[20:13:09] <RA3OR> I hate hardcodations
[20:13:23] <RA3OR> jrockjiggz: works
[20:30:03] <MeMReS> what is a constructor?
[20:30:32] <coldhead> it's a method which initializes an object when you create a new instance
[20:30:40] <Cork> function maker() {}; var v = new maker() <-- constructor
[20:31:07] <MeMReS> so maker() is the constructor?
[20:31:14] <Cork> in that case yes
[20:31:26] <Cork> a function you call with new is a constructor
[20:31:54] <MeMReS> gotcha, thank you
[20:31:56] * coldhead takes notes
[21:00:26] <MeMReS> just watched a video called JavaScript essentials where the host talks about anti-patterns, and i'm pretty sure i've used every single antipattern there is
[21:00:58] <hg_> on youtube?
[21:01:01] <MeMReS> yeah
[21:01:17] <hg_> was it a talk by crockford?
[21:02:25] <MeMReS> it's one by Travis Tidwell
[21:03:47] <MeMReS> it's really an intro to JS for developers
[21:05:43] <hg_> oh ok
[21:08:04] <divxkorea> Hi All,
[21:08:20] <divxkorea> I would likte to ask EasyTabs plugin
[21:08:49] <divxkorea> EasyTabs plugin problem is inner iframe select tab.
[21:11:11] <coldhead> it's not as Easy as advertised is it!
[21:11:13] <coldhead> HAHAHAHAHA
[21:11:39] <MeMReS> lol
[21:11:44] <divxkorea> ?

[21:15:08] <RA3OR> anyone knows how i can delete a row in datatables with jquery ?
[21:15:50] <RA3OR> im doing $('#'+noteID).delay(100).fadeOut('200');
[21:15:51] <RA3OR> 				$('#'+noteID).html('');
[21:16:16] <RA3OR> but its still "
[21:16:16] <RA3OR> # 	Note content	Date Added	Action
[21:16:16] <RA3OR> 1	sd asdas d	2013-01-31 07:10:22	
[21:16:16] <RA3OR> Showing 1 to 2 of 2 entries
[21:16:37] <RA3OR> But its still "Showing 1 to 2 of 2 entries" (sorry)
[21:17:19] <destinydriven> I'm getting a weird error using jquery cycle. http://dev.slmda.org/    Firebug reports "
[21:17:19] <destinydriven> [cycle] terminating; zero elements found by selector"   but this element 'div.slideshow' exists.
[21:17:54] <MeMReS> RA30R: http://datatables.net/api#fnDeleteRow  ?
[21:19:16] <coldhead> destinydriven: i think that means it can't find elements WITHIN .slideshow
[21:19:26] <coldhead> paris is stale and it's war if we fail
[21:19:40] <destinydriven> coldhead, bummer
[21:30:50] <destinydriven> coldhead, I'm not sure I understand because when I look at the markup. all the contents of .slideshow is there   .NewsSummary
[21:34:22] <coldhead> destinydriven: your code isn't wrapped in $(document).ready()
[21:34:29] <coldhead> so that selector runs before the page has loaded
[21:34:31] <coldhead> and matches nothing
[21:34:33] <coldhead> and it gives up
[21:34:39] <destinydriven> its in window.load
[21:34:41] <coldhead> wrap it in ready and it should work better
[21:34:44] <coldhead> it isn't
[21:34:50] <coldhead> oh it is
[21:34:53] <destinydriven> so ready is better than load?
[21:35:10] <coldhead> ready runs sooner
[21:35:13] <coldhead> so it's used more often
[21:35:19] <coldhead> i would expect window load to fire as well though
[21:35:22] <coldhead> i'd try ready
[21:35:31] <destinydriven> ok I'll give that a go
[21:35:33] <coldhead> the code works when i run it from the console
[21:35:38] <coldhead> so it sure feels like a timing thing
[21:35:43] <destinydriven> k
[21:36:31] <destinydriven> coldhead, same thing happens with ready
[21:36:50] <coldhead> GUH
[21:36:51] <destinydriven> this is weird cuz this is the exact code I used here :  stlucianic.org
[21:38:14] <coldhead> are you loading content into .slideshow dynamically?
[21:38:22] <destinydriven> yeah
[21:38:50] <destinydriven> jquery cycle
[21:39:24] <coldhead> you misunderstand me
[21:39:36] <coldhead> i mean are you adding new html to the <div class="slideshow">
[21:39:41] <coldhead> other than what is there when you load the page
[21:39:45] <destinydriven> ohcibi, nope its just hidden
[21:40:00] <destinydriven> @coldhead ^
[21:40:18] <coldhead> is it possibly a conflict with nivo slider?
[21:40:24] <coldhead> does it work if you comment that out?
[21:40:31] <coldhead> it's unusual to use both
[21:40:33] <destinydriven> lemme try removing nivo
[21:41:20] <destinydriven> its not nivo conflicting
[21:41:32] <coldhead> zuh
[21:41:43] <coldhead> it just wigs me out that it works in the console and not in the <script>
[21:41:56] <destinydriven> me too
[21:42:16] <coldhead> next i would try adding console.log( $('.slideshow') ); just before you try applying cycle()
[21:42:23] <coldhead> just to see what's actually being matched there
[21:42:49] <coldhead> click in the log to open the matched element (if any) and see if it really has children
[21:43:13] <destinydriven> ok
[21:44:43] <destinydriven> the content is in there 3 elements
[21:48:31] <destinydriven> coldhead, I would have understood if I  were using ajax to get the content but in this case it just doesn't work when everything else looks fine
[21:50:15] <coldhead> AND YET IT WORKS ONCE THE PAGE IS LOADED
[21:50:23] <coldhead> i would be trying crazy stuff at this point
[21:50:51] <coldhead> like move the cycle() code to a separate <script> with a $(document).ready at the very end of the page
[21:51:36] <destinydriven> ok I'll try that
[21:51:46] <destinydriven>  althought I think I may have tried something like this already
[21:52:18] <coldhead> i would also try commenting out the options piece by piece in case they're breaking it
[21:52:23] <coldhead> esp. the next and prev selectors
[21:52:29] <coldhead> it MIGHT give up if it can't find them
[21:53:29] <coldhead> and pageer
[21:53:53] <destinydriven> ok
[21:54:34] <coldhead> and failing that i would mess with the code for cycle.js and find the bit where it logs that error message and start debugging
[21:54:38] <MeMReS> distiny
[21:54:44] <coldhead> or just go home and get fucked up
[21:54:46] <coldhead> whatever works
[21:54:48] <MeMReS>  div class="NewsSummarySummary">  <----
[21:55:00] <MeMReS> on the second one
[21:55:21] <destinydriven> MeMReS, hmm?
[21:55:34] <MeMReS> look at your code your missing a <
[21:55:50] <destinydriven> ok lemme take a closer look at this
[21:56:01] <destinydriven> its being generated by a smarty template
[21:56:04] <coldhead> yes invalid html is a dealbreaker :)
[21:56:09] <coldhead> well spotted MeMReS
[21:56:19] <MeMReS> ty ;)
[21:58:13] <destinydriven> ahhh, its in the news article itself
[21:58:26] <destinydriven> was looking at the template all along
[21:58:39] <destinydriven> makes sense that it would be somewhere in there
[22:00:55] <MeMReS> any good IDE's for JQuery?
[22:02:09] <MeMReS> dual booting OSX and Windows on my PC either OS is fine
[22:02:44] <RA3OR> if i have this $.post(ajaxURL, serializedData, function(response) { inside a function, can i access response from outside that function? from another function
[22:03:07] <coldhead> that fix things destinydriven ?
[22:03:17] <destinydriven> I haven't found it yet
[22:03:24] <coldhead> oh god
[22:04:23] <RA3OR> clones
[22:05:04] <MeMReS> I'm just learning JS but i think you can return the function
[22:08:46] <destinydriven> MeMReS, I
[22:08:50] <destinydriven> MeMReS, I
[22:09:14] <destinydriven> MeMReS, I'm not seeing where  I have missing braces in my code
[22:09:48] <destinydriven> I've stripped the article contents  to bare minimum and went through the template code with a fine tooth comb. My page also validates
[22:09:56] <MeMReS> I saw it when there was 3 articles
[22:10:30] <destinydriven> I thought that was the case too. But I've cleaned up so i can spot anomalies easier and the problem still persists
[22:14:53] <BryanRuiz_> alright
[22:15:00] <relipse> is there a way to chain ajax functions simply in jquery?
[22:15:05] <BryanRuiz_> i need to cancel a mouseout from a hover if i click
[22:15:11] <BryanRuiz_> im not sure how to do thatr
[22:15:32] <relipse> $('foo').send().send().send().send(); all 4 sends should send one after the other
[22:16:11] <kamoricks> relipse: .then(). It's detailed in $.ajax, as well as $.get and $.post
[22:17:14] <relipse> kamoricks: i dont see any examples that i was looking for
[22:18:05] <kamoricks> relipse: $('foo').send().then(function() { foo.send().then(function() { foo.send().then(function () { foo.send(); }); }); }); });
[22:18:39] <relipse> ughghg

[22:28:38] <the_dark_knight> Hi, is there any better way to update some part of a view / web page than using jquery's get / post method to add / append the updated data to the <div>? please help.
[22:32:16] <destinydriven> MeMReS, removing jquery-ui.js on the page fixed things

[22:56:02] <raver> Hi.. I'm using jquery-ui datepicker and i want to run multiple instances on a single page.. however it seems that the calendar does not want to run on jquery generated fields... Basically i have a jquery function which creates a new date field, but the calendar does not apply to it
[22:56:23] <raver> any idea how i can get it to run?
[22:59:13] <Pal> Hi to every one.... Not able to accessing the Dom elements after the iframe html page  loaded. i tried $('selector').contents()....but i am getting error in console as .contents is not a function
[22:59:55] <faraway> raver: do oyu call .datepicker() on the newly generated elements ?
[22:59:57] <Pal> Please share your knowledge if known
[23:00:02] <trinadh> raver: initialize datepicker on the field after it is generated
[23:00:32] <raver> yes, right after append
[23:00:44] <raver> like so: $("div.trips").append(content);         $( ".datepicker" ).datepicker({ minDate: 0, dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy' });
[23:00:55] <raver> where content is the new field, obviously :)
[23:03:46] <faraway> raver: and if you do $( ".datepicker" ).css({"border":"1px solid red"}); the elements you want to use as datepicker get a border ?
[23:09:07] <AtomicDog> Yes.
[23:10:23] <chriys> does someone can try this website and tell me if it works. Im verifying if its accessible from outsite thanks

[23:23:37] <digitalmediaguy> Anyone ever seen this sucker? Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLImageElement> has no method 'closest'  I get that when I try to use a selector at the bottom of an animation with several nested levelsâ€¦ Any thoughts on why? I can alert from the same spotâ€¦ but when I use .closest it gives that error?
[23:23:50] <relipse>  argg i tried addClass('error'); and it is not doing anything
[23:24:08] <kamoricks> digitalmediaguy: Because #<HTMLImageElement> has no method closest.
[23:26:18] <kamoricks> digitalmediaguy: You've already got a single element, and it's not JQuery-based. You need to wrap your var in $() if you want to call closest, but however you're doing it, you've already gotten a single item.
[23:27:43] <digitalmediaguy> thanksâ€¦ the line looks like this $(this).closest('.item').hide();     So it's do to "this" ? that must be getting the wrong thing?
[23:29:40] <digitalmediaguy> http://jsfiddle.net/PNrxZ/   line 46
[23:29:49] <larsemil> xec: okay, will look into the add method. thanks
[23:32:02] <digitalmediaguy> My goal is to remove a masonry "item" and then reload masonry at the end of the animationâ€¦ So I was just placing some code at the end of the animation to do it?â€¦. perhaps someone knows a better way? fiddle above

[23:54:43] <djQuery> raver1, were on jquery ui asking about a datepicker?
[23:55:07] <raver1> yes, i managed to fix it though :)
[23:55:45] <raver1> trouble was i was cloning some html which already had that class, and datepicker saw it had the class hasDatepicker
[23:55:45] <djQuery> $(document).on('focus', 'input', function(){ $(this).datepicker(); });
[23:55:57] <djQuery> ahhh
[23:55:58] <greek> Hello, how do you fellas manage your upgrading of jQuery? We have a situation where we have lots of little custom software modules written for lots of different clients, but that all share a reusable codebase. Each time a new version of jQuery is released, we upgrade it on the reusable codebase. But we're running into the issue now where our custom modules are breaking due to lack of backwards compability. This is perfectly fair. I'm just w
[23:55:59] <greek> ondering what the best way to manage this is... skip out on upgrading jQuery? Upgrade every module every time a new version of jQuery comes out?
[23:56:02] <raver1> actually, this was the solution: $("div.trips").find('.datepicker').removeClass("hasDatepicker").datepicker({ minDate: 0, dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy' });
[23:56:04] <fRAiLtY-> You'll all be pleased to know I've had some success, http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/CQkL8/8/ now correctly counts down the hours to 11am, however it still effectively "restarts" the countdown from the whole hour (currently 4) on each refresh, why?
[23:56:22] <raver1> a bit ugly, but it works
[23:57:28] <djQuery> raver1, I typicaly use a template engine instead of cloning for reasons like this
[23:58:15] <djQuery> raver1, err might I make a suggestion
[23:58:38] <djQuery> that will apply to every datepicker on the page right?
[23:59:26] <djQuery> when you clone it add a class, then only search for items that have both the cloned class and the hasdatepicker class
[23:59:30] <djQuery> remove both classes
[23:59:43] <djQuery> then apply datepicker
