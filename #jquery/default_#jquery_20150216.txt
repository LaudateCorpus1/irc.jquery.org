[00:52:44] <Zumochi> Hello! I'm trying to make a table where only 2 out of the 7 columns are visible at the same time. I made a function that hides columns. Now the problem is not all columns have content. So if I hide columns 3-7, the last 2 rows in columns 1 and 2 don't have content. Now I can't get my function to hide empty rows if the columns that are visible don't have content to work. Any ideas? :) Do note
[00:52:44] <Zumochi> I'm fairly novice at jQuery.
[01:13:26] <drag0nius> is there .find that includes node we are calling it on?
[01:14:37] <sacho> erm
[01:14:48] <sacho> $().find(selector).addBack(selector), maybe
[01:15:29] <drag0nius> like var $tables = $('table'); ... $table.notnot('skip-filters').tableFilter();
[01:15:53] <drag0nius> missing 's' there
[01:16:28] <Cork> drag0nius, sacho: no need for a selector in addBack
[01:16:33] <Cork> the rest is correct
[01:16:41] <Cork> $().find(selector).addBack()
[01:16:54] <sacho> why?
[01:17:02] <sacho> would the element be filtered by the selector?
[01:17:18] <Cork> addBack adds the elements $() had found
[01:17:35] <drag0nius> Cork: thanks
[01:17:52] <Cork> if you add a filter there it will only add the elements from the original set that matches
[01:17:54] <sacho> I know what it does..I assumed he wanted them filtered by the selector as well.
[01:18:19] <drag0nius> i'm kinda dumb, simple .not() was enough
[01:19:08] <drag0nius> but shouldn't it be like $().addBack().find()?
[01:19:17] <Cork> no
[01:19:30] <Cork> $() creates a set .find creates a new set
[01:19:38] <Cork> .addBack merges these two sets
[01:19:49] <drag0nius> sounds like ur suggestion would add previous set unfiltered
[01:19:57] <Cork> yes
[01:20:08] <Cork> that is what you asked for
[01:21:55] <drag0nius> what i actually wanted to know is $().filter() ;d
[01:22:15] <Cork> he
[01:22:19] <Cork> *heh
[01:22:43] <Cork> you need to explain what you need a bit more next time :)
[01:23:59] <drag0nius> so what i should ask is "is there .find that searches over nodes we are calling it on?"
[01:24:18] <Cork> ya
[01:24:44] <Cork> or "searches the elements you run it on instead of children"
[01:25:11] <Cork> the part where you don't care about children matters
[01:34:02] <prohobo> if i have a path selected in jquery
[01:34:21] <prohobo> can i overlay the path with an icon?
[01:34:26] <Cork> a path?
[01:34:26] <prohobo> like a warning !
[01:34:37] <prohobo> yeah an SVG path
[01:34:40] <Cork> ah
[01:34:53] <Cork> svg don't have nesting like that no
[01:35:15] <Cork> you would have to create an image element and put it where you want it
[01:35:21] <prohobo> ah
[01:35:24] <Cork> in relation to the path
[01:35:28] <prohobo> i guess i'd get the position
[01:35:37] <prohobo> and just absolute an img over it
[01:35:39] <prohobo> hmm
[01:36:13] <prohobo> ty
[01:38:04] <DRSK> var productHash = window.location.hash.replace( '#!/', '' ) || false; <-- that's false if there isn't a hash otherwise it's set to the current hash without #!/ stuff. How would I go about adding another condition to that same declaration of productHash so that if the value of the hash equals 'something' productHash will be 'something'
[01:38:09] <DRSK> oupos, somethingElse I meant
[01:38:14] <DRSK> as well as false if nothing.
[01:39:02] <DRSK> productHash = window.location.hash.replace( '#!/', '' ) == 'something' == 'somethingElse' || false; or something ;p I'm just curious how to go about it rather than using a couple of IF else stuffs :)
[01:39:37] <Cork> hash will always be a string so the false section isn't needed
[01:39:44] <Omar-> morning
[01:39:47] <Cork> so just add a second replace
[01:40:05] <Cork> DRSK: var productHash = window.location.hash.replace('#!/', '').replace(/^something$/, 'somethingElse')
[01:40:36] <DRSK> Oh, and what would the string be if there's no hash? cause I'm using !== false on productHash to check if it's not set at all, should I simply just do !== '' ?
[01:40:43] <Cork> ''
[01:40:52] <DRSK> Ah okay!
[01:41:29] <Cork> note i used regex for the second replace
[01:41:35] <Cork> so you don't risk getting partial matches
[01:46:46] <drag0nius> anyone ever used picnet's tablefilter? How do i skip some columns?
[01:49:09] <prohobo> is there a channel for d3js?
[02:04:17] <drag0nius> can i add same node to multiple places?
[02:04:29] <drag0nius> should i bind .click() before or after adding it?
[02:04:36] <Cork> no
[02:04:44] <Cork> an element is always unique
[02:04:49] <Cork> if you want a copy you have to clone it
[02:05:15] <Cork> also you should use delegated event handlers in those cases
[02:05:21] <Cork> instead of adding it to each element
[02:05:49] <drag0nius> http://wklej.org/hash/856c8c2974f/ this
[02:06:15] <Cork> O_o'
[02:06:26] <Cork> you update the page in a setInterval??
[02:06:32] <drag0nius> it's global script
[02:06:39] <Cork> you REALLY should avoid that
[02:06:45] <drag0nius> adding stuff to every table
[02:06:45] <Cork> for several reasons
[02:06:49] <drag0nius> in the whole app
[02:06:58] <drag0nius> i can't call ready every time can i?
[02:07:05] <Cork> no
[02:07:09] <Cork> what are you doing?
[02:07:22] <drag0nius> i'm running ajaxified app
[02:07:29] <drag0nius> every table in whole app needs this
[02:07:37] <drag0nius> except 1 or 2
[02:07:38] <Cork> and why do you need the setInteval?
[02:08:25] <drag0nius> how else can i run this code globally without changing every file i have table in
[02:08:42] <Cork> that isn't an answer
[02:08:45] <Cork> why do you need it
[02:08:52] <drag0nius> i know this is not perfect, but looks good enough in this particular case
[02:09:04] <Tawre> hey Cork, you're amazing
[02:09:14] <drag0nius> because i'm dynamically loading html
[02:09:17] <Cork> drag0nius: if it is cause you modify the tables from ajax
[02:09:31] <Cork> you should bind callbacks from the ajax calls or ajaxComplete instead
[02:09:39] <Cork> setInterval is a horrible idea
[02:09:47] <Cork> Tawre: uh... thx?
[02:10:12] <drag0nius> the code normally resides in the script tag at the end of templates
[02:10:45] <Cork> drag0nius: setInterval will fire every second for ever no matter how long the code needs to wait
[02:10:50] <Cork> or if the computer goes to sleep
[02:10:59] <Cork> or the cpu get busy
[02:11:07] <Cork> queuing up the functions
[02:11:21] <drag0nius> hmm, that indeed looks bad
[02:11:27] <Cork> and as this seams like a lazy way of handling "i modified the dom" it is REALLY REALLY BAD
[02:11:38] <drag0nius> can i hook into jquery ajax?
[02:11:41] <Cork> yes
[02:11:45] <drag0nius> how?
[02:11:56] <Cork> if you need to do it globally use ajaxComplete
[02:12:02] <Cork> ?api ajaxcomplete
[02:12:02] <b-ot> Cork: .ajaxComplete(): Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete. This is an <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events">Ajax Event</a>. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[02:12:03] <Meir`> depends how you load the table data in first place?
[02:12:09] <Cork> ya
[02:12:18] <Cork> there is too little context to give a good answer
[02:12:32] <Cork> but setInterval is basically the worst possible solution you could use
[02:12:34] <Meir`> and what's this: $(this).toCSV('dane.csv');
[02:12:45] <drag0nius> i just told i'm running ajaxified application
[02:12:59] <Cork> drag0nius: that word doesn't mean anything
[02:13:00] <drag0nius> custom function turning table into csv file
[02:13:23] <Cork> it just means "i don't reload the entire page when doing updates"
[02:13:31] <Cork> nothing about how you update the page
[02:13:44] <drag0nius> it's when you load most stuff with ajax, but sending rendered html instead of json
[02:14:09] <Cork> eh, no it isn't
[02:14:11] <Cork> but what ever
[02:14:13] <drag0nius> it's loaded with $().load()
[02:14:18] <IzaacJ> hey, I'm having some issues with my jQuery. I'm not so familiar with it, so if anyone could take a look and maybe understand why the $(addressPicker).on() function doesn't do anything: https://gist.github.com/IzaacJ/199fedbd5b61bd253da4
[02:14:21] <Cork> there you go
[02:14:27] <drag0nius> or actually i'm loading with load
[02:14:34] <Cork> drag0nius: so best option is to bind the .done callback on the .load call
[02:14:39] <drag0nius> not sure anyone else in the project is doing this
[02:14:56] <drag0nius> saw some raw ajax calls when i came
[02:15:15] <Cork> time to look through the code and clean it up then
[02:15:22] <drag0nius> so right now, i could debounce/throttle ajaxComplete
[02:16:06] <Meir`> drag0nius, by which conditions  .tableFilter() and ).tablesorter() are filtering and sorting?
[02:16:14] <drag0nius> what you mean?
[02:16:31] <Meir`> i assume they should filter and sort
[02:16:45] <Meir`> how is it done?
[02:17:11] <drag0nius> .tableFilter() adds second thead row with search textboxes, and .tablesorter() sorts by columns on thead click
[02:17:50] <Meir`> so why do you need to add those every second?
[02:18:19] <drag0nius> i'm not
[02:18:29] <Meir`> so why it's inside setInterval?
[02:18:34] <drag0nius> .tableFilter's row has class .filters
[02:18:46] <drag0nius> bye checking it's presence i know the code was already run
[02:20:49] <Meir`> and when the class .filters is added to a row?
[02:21:07] <drag0nius> somewhere during filters initialization, it's 3rd party lib
[02:22:17] <Meir`> i still don't understand why you should run it every second
[02:22:31] <drag0nius> we just resolved that issue
[02:22:51] <drag0nius> i'm gonna move it into debounced ajaxComplete
[02:23:57] <Meir`> yeah, that's the acceptable way, but i would consider not using .load() if you wish to keep the dom
[02:24:06] <Meir`> ajax is powerful
[02:24:24] <Meir`> you should think about loading only the data, or at least only the rows
[02:24:30] <drag0nius> trust me, if it was up to me i'd not render html server side
[02:24:43] <Meir`> i see
[02:24:54] <drag0nius> the project was started this way since i was ill for over a month
[02:25:09] <drag0nius> by ppl having no clue about Django (server side) or javascript
[02:25:33] <Meir`> and you're forced to build things on top of their failures?
[02:26:16] <Meir`> convince the man in charge that you need to start from scratch
[02:26:31] <drag0nius> it's actually 2nd version
[02:26:32] <Meir`> sometimes it's much more efficient and wise
[02:26:54] <drag0nius> first was complete mess, while i was ill they came to conclusion they couldn't write it anymore and started without me again
[02:27:31] <drag0nius> at least this time they had any experience
[02:27:37] <drag0nius> so it's not so big mess
[02:28:56] <drag0nius> hopefully we'll be done with it this week
[02:30:22] <drag0nius> we were to do that last week, but some global features requirements emerged
[02:32:50] <drag0nius> there isn't nodelist.each()?
[02:33:39] <Cork> $(nodelist).each
[02:37:37] <drag0nius> is there some built-in debounce in jquery?
[02:37:52] <Cork> debounce? you mean animation?
[02:38:27] <drag0nius> debounce like in delaying stuff until events spam is over
[02:39:59] <IzaacJ> anyone? I'm having some issues with my jQuery. I'm not so familiar with it, so if anyone could take a look and maybe understand why the $(addressPicker).on() function doesn't do anything: https://gist.github.com/IzaacJ/199fedbd5b61bd253da4
[02:41:14] <drag0nius> kind of opposite of throttling (running function immediately, but then not-launching it until timeout)
[02:42:36] <jop008> hi friends what is a good component for editng n:m relationships having  search, reorder items, and (de)select all?
[02:44:00] <Cork> IzaacJ: you run an event handler on a javascript object
[02:44:18] <Cork> so unless AddressPicker generates jquery fake events nothing will fire there
[02:44:52] <drag0nius> how do i add a function to base jquery object?
[02:45:17] <Cork> drag0nius: you would add it to the prototype of jquery
[02:45:26] <Cork> $.fn.newFunctionName = function()
[02:45:29] <drag0nius> not $.fn?
[02:45:38] <Cork> $.fn is a shorthand for prototype
[02:46:02] <Cork> note though, this adds it to all jquery objects
[02:46:04] <IzaacJ> Cork: Doesn't really know if AddressPicker does that, but I've just modified the call from the example here: https://github.com/sgruhier/typeahead-addresspicker/blob/master/demo/index.html#L76
[02:46:05] <Cork> not just a specific one
[02:47:36] <Cork> IzaacJ: addressPicker.bindDefaultTypeaheadEvent($('#address1')) ?
[02:47:40] <Cork> might be why?
[02:48:03] <Cork> hard to say without knowing how that constructor works
[02:48:06] <IzaacJ> Cork: okey. I'll add that above.
[02:50:05] <IzaacJ> Cork: that made no difference. Hmm. Wish I had more jQuery experience, then I might've been able to figure this out.
[02:50:35] <Cork> IzaacJ: the problem has quite little to do with jquery and a lot to to with that constructor
[02:53:05] <IzaacJ> Cork: okey. so if that constructor was 'correct' for this use, as they show in their example, my code should put the returned latitude and longitude in the inputs that have ID 'lat' and 'long'?
[02:53:35] <IzaacJ> Just to make sure my code in the on() function ain't wrong
[02:54:11] <Cork> IzaacJ: well the constructor defines the api, so by definition its "correct" :)
[02:54:21] <Cork> but what it expects depends on that function not jquery
[02:54:46] <Cork> IzaacJ: your code is wrong as the other snippet works
[02:54:57] <Cork> but how it is wrong is where things gets hard to answer
[02:56:54] <IzaacJ> Cork: okey. hmm...
[02:58:31] <surianup> Hi
[02:58:32] <surianup> all
[02:58:39] <surianup> I need some help
[02:59:05] <surianup> I want to get the span text
[02:59:12] <surianup> i am doing like this
[02:59:13] <surianup> $(function(){
[02:59:13] <surianup>    $(".numbformat").find(function(c, obj){
[02:59:13] <surianup>       $(obj).text(addCommas(parseFloat($(obj).text()).toFixed(2)));
[02:59:13] <surianup>    });
[02:59:13] <surianup> });
[03:01:43] <MajorWork> document.getElementById("span_id").innerHTML;
[03:01:46] <drag0nius> $('.numbformat').each(function(i,obj){var $obj = $(obj).text(parseFloat($obj.text()).toFixed(2))
[03:01:52] <Cork> ?code
[03:01:53] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:02:02] <Cork> don't paste code in the channel unless it is single lines
[03:02:25] <drag0nius> ***var $obj = $(obj); $obj.text***
[03:03:00] <Cork> (was mainly directed at surianup)
[03:03:07] <drag0nius> basically what you wrote, but with .each() not .find()
[03:03:50] <surianup> drag0nius I was doing with .each() but it is not working
[03:04:24] <drag0nius> surianup:  are you sure addCommas returns right valu?
[03:04:25] <MajorWork> What is the function doing?
[03:04:35] <MajorWork> or intending to do
[03:04:51] <drag0nius> you probably want to do something like parseFloat(...).replace('.',',')
[03:05:00] <drag0nius> you probably want to do something like parseFloat(...).toFixed(2).replace('.',',')
[03:06:42] <surianup> Yes drag0nius
[03:06:42] <surianup>  Iam giving you all code
[03:07:01] <drag0nius> put it on jsfiddle
[03:08:53] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/wr0nsevt/
[03:09:52] <IzaacJ> Cork: could it be that my code runs on Query(document).ready() ? they do not seem to use that in their code.
[03:10:26] <drag0nius> $(function(){...}) === $(document).ready(function(){...})
[03:10:33] <drag0nius> and there was 3rd option i don't remember
[03:10:46] <drag0nius> they're all equivalent
[03:11:04] <Cork> no there is only two versions
[03:11:11] <IzaacJ> drag0nius: thanks. Good to know in the future :)
[03:12:34] <surianup> drag0nius
[03:12:45] <surianup> have you seen the link
[03:12:45] <surianup> ?
[03:13:00] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/wr0nsevt/1/
[03:13:01] <drag0nius> yeah, but you should also include html in the future
[03:13:24] <surianup> yes I have update the already
[03:13:28] <surianup> yes I have updated the already
[03:13:38] <MajorWork> lol
[03:14:09] <surianup> MajorWork
[03:14:09] <surianup>  why you are laughting?
[03:14:22] <MajorWork> sorry
[03:14:35] <surianup> np
[03:14:35] <MajorWork> I added /1/ to see if you had added the html and you have
[03:15:11] <MajorWork> im just tired
[03:15:54] <drag0nius> you didnt include jquery there
[03:16:14] <surianup> drag0nius where
[03:16:15] <Cork> surianup:
[03:16:15] <Cork> <surianup> I want to get the span text
[03:16:16] <surianup> ?
[03:16:17] <Cork> opps
[03:16:21] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/wr0nsevt/2/
[03:17:23] <surianup> Cork
[03:17:32] <surianup> what was the mistake
[03:17:33] <surianup> ?
[03:17:39] <surianup> please tell me
[03:17:57] <drag0nius> surianup:  http://jsfiddle.net/wr0nsevt/3/ this
[03:18:38] <surianup> Cork  in my page not working
[03:18:47] <drag0nius> i think there is something wrong with your addCommas
[03:19:08] <drag0nius> dumb question, but are you including jquery before your code?
[03:19:26] <Cork> its not?
[03:19:28] <Cork> works fine here
[03:19:29] <drag0nius> checked console for errors?
[03:20:01] <drag0nius> i changed your code a bit for debugging and it was working fine
[03:20:22] <IzaacJ> Cork: they have another example that looks almost like mine here: https://github.com/sgruhier/typeahead-addresspicker#events
[03:21:06] <Cork> IzaacJ: https://github.com/sgruhier/typeahead-addresspicker#events
[03:21:15] <Cork> so ya, the bindDefaultTypeaheadEvent is important
[03:21:56] <IzaacJ> Cork: even with it the code doesn't do as supposed :(
[03:21:57] <surianup> drag0nius
[03:21:58] <surianup>  I ma working in the JS file
[03:22:11] <Cork> IzaacJ: is the selector matching the correct element?
[03:22:13] <surianup> and also jquery is working in that page
[03:22:31] <surianup> but why this scode does not works for me
[03:22:36] <surianup> totally pissed off
[03:22:47] <Cork> surianup: what in /2/ doesn't work?
[03:22:51] <drag0nius> if you copy over my code to your file it doesn't work?
[03:23:00] <Cork> ah
[03:23:07] <drag0nius> it probably means you don't have jquery at all on your page
[03:23:16] <Cork> it might be scope problems too
[03:23:34] <Cork> surianup: btw you have a ton of global variables in addCommas
[03:23:37] <Cork> you should fix that
[03:24:20] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/9tvm9pbf/
[03:24:40] <surianup> this si the link and there are working jquery you can see
[03:24:51] <IzaacJ> Cork: yes it is. a div containing inputs with ID's #address, #lat, #long, all of type="text"
[03:25:48] <Cork> surianup: any errors in the console?
[03:25:49] <surianup> drag0nius
[03:25:49] <surianup> I have jast copied and paste code but it is not working for me
[03:26:16] <surianup> Cork
[03:26:17] <surianup>  no error in console
[03:26:42] <Cork> and console.log($(".numbformat").length) before var $matches = $(".numbformat");
[03:26:44] <Cork> gives you what?
[03:27:25] <surianup> lat me check
[03:28:10] <surianup> Cork it showing 0
[03:28:27] <Cork> surianup: there's your problem
[03:28:42] <Cork> nothing happens cause you have no elements matching .numformat
[03:28:58] <surianup> means
[03:28:59] <surianup> ?
[03:29:05] <Cork> nothing happens cause you have no elements matching .numformat
[03:29:19] <Cork> it means nothing to loop
[03:29:38] <narcarsiss> Hello. I'm trying to On selecting "Selling Format" Hide the <li> element  Fixed Price or Auction start Bid. Depending on which one is Selected.  If "Fixed" Then "Auction Start Bid" will be Hidden. and Vice Versa.   http://jsfiddle.net/xLzem9n7/4/
[03:30:52] <surianup> But there is <span class="numbformat">14702.17 </span>
[03:31:00] <surianup> present
[03:31:26] <Cork> not when the selector runs
[03:31:28] <surianup> drag0nius  you there?
[03:31:51] <Cork> most likely the element is added through ajax
[03:31:54] <Cork> so it doesn't exist yet
[03:32:24] <Cork> also don't use this $("#switchtoMap").attr("checked") == "checked"
[03:32:25] <drag0nius> pretty much what cork said
[03:32:31] <Cork> use $("#switchtoMap").prop("checked")
[03:32:42] <Cork> the former is buggy
[03:32:52] <Cork> (it isn't intended for that use)
[03:34:02] <Omar-> narcarsiss http://jsfiddle.net/xLzem9n7/6/
[03:34:33] <Omar-> how to extend this function? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L125
[03:34:51] <Omar-> or overwrite for testing purposes
[03:36:12] <narcarsiss> Thankyou Omar-:
[03:36:29] <surianup> Cork  I ma addding the html element when ajax response back
[03:36:40] <surianup> but is not there any solution?
[03:36:59] <Cork> surianup: you want to do the selection in the success/done callback from the ajax call
[03:37:15] <Cork> cause where you do it now is way earlier
[03:37:52] <Omar-> narcarsiss you're welcome :)
[03:39:18] <surianup> I don't know what I have to do
[03:39:29] <surianup> stuck now
[03:39:41] <Cork> surianup: $.ajax().done(function() { $('.numformat').each(...) });
[03:39:46] <Cork> THAT is what you need to do
[03:39:51] <Omar-> narcarsiss you also have mixed values of acution/fixed in select. http://jsfiddle.net/xLzem9n7/7/
[03:47:47] <narcarsiss> Strange it works in JSfiddle but not in any of my Browsers :|
[03:48:06] <surianup> sorry Cork it is not working
[03:49:13] <surianup> why this hell not workign very frustrated today
[03:53:01] <prohobo> surianup: ajax is not instant
[03:54:07] <prohobo> err the output for an ajax call is not sequential with your control flow
[03:54:11] <IzaacJ> Cork: dunno if you answered to my reply about the div and ID's, my computer messed up xD haha Win10 TP for the win :P
[03:54:19] <prohobo> you have to wait for it to fire the callback
[03:55:02] <surianup> prohobo what can I do
[03:55:10] <surianup> to fic my issu
[03:55:23] <surianup> I am new in these things
[03:55:41] <surianup> I have not most knowledge about thes things
[03:55:50] <surianup> that's why i have stuck
[03:56:27] <prohobo> ajax calls have a 'success' callback
[03:56:44] <prohobo> read it http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[04:00:25] <surianup> prohobo
[04:00:33] <surianup> I have read but

[04:18:07] <lolmaus> Cork: thx
[04:18:39] <badasafish> Hi all, I'm trying to amend a jQuery plugin to use a different reference for jQuery, i've assigned jQuery to $j due to conflicts with prototype.  I'm confused as to how to amend this file: http://www.doble-shop.co.uk/Scripts/jQuery.mmenu-master/src/js/jquery.mmenu.min.all.js
[04:19:40] <Cork> badasafish: you've done all you should need already
[04:20:24] <caper> hey is there any way to find the user click
[04:20:26] <surianup> prohobo
[04:20:27] <surianup>  when I call the function it has not call to there
[04:20:30] <Cork> badasafish: though i strongly recommend NOT to mix multiple versions of jquery
[04:20:47] <Cork> caper: the user click?
[04:20:57] <badasafish> cork: unfortunately I have no choice in this matter, due to the integration of magento
[04:21:13] <Cork> badasafish: and you can't use the older version?
[04:21:22] <surianup> on the success of ajax I want to call the other function name is addcomas but call is not going there
[04:21:34] <surianup> prohobo
[04:21:53] <badasafish> cork: the problem is because the prototype library is also used, hence the $ variable explodes
[04:22:02] <Cork> ah
[04:22:11] <Cork> badasafish: jquery has built in support for that
[04:22:23] <Cork> just call $.noConflict()
[04:22:30] <Cork> or jQuery.noConflict()
[04:22:45] <Cork> plugins (if written correctly) can stay unchanged
[04:22:45] <badasafish> cork: i've used that and used it to assign jQuery to my $j variable
[04:23:19] <Cork> badasafish: ya, that's fine, but you don't need to patch the plugins
[04:23:44] <badasafish> cork: well if a plugin references $ won't that be the prototype $?
[04:23:45] <Cork> that is what (function($) {})(jQuery) are for (all plugins should be wrapped in this)
[04:23:56] <Cork> badasafish: not if wrapped in that ^
[04:24:16] <Cork> or !function($) {}(jQuery);
[04:24:26] <Cork> (basically the same thing)
[04:24:44] <badasafish> Cork: do you have an IM i can contact you on? I would like to discuss this problem with you
[04:24:51] <Cork> no
[04:25:08] <Uhkis> what is irc if not an im
[04:25:17] <badasafish> haha yeah I guess
[04:25:50] <badasafish> cork: well the plugin works fine, but there are some other javascript includes on various pages that break this script and I'm trying to get to the bottom of why this is occuring
[04:26:14] <Cork> badasafish: most likely it isn't cause of that plugin
[04:26:21] <Cork> looks like it was written correctly from the start
[04:26:45] <badasafish> cork: yeah, I was tring to tackle the problem kind of back to front, as I couldn't figure it out any other way
[04:26:58] <Cork> badasafish: you have a link?
[04:27:46] <badasafish> cork: http://www.doble-shop.co.uk/shop/scorpion-exo-1000-type-e-11-air-dog-rage-helm.html
[04:28:38] <badasafish> cork: through trial and error I found that this file was causing the plugin to break: http://www.doble-shop.co.uk/shop/js/infortis/jquery/plugins/jquery.colorbox.min.js
[04:29:15] <badasafish> cork: I was able to fix this issue by changing the $ to $j in the colorbox file
[04:29:41] <badasafish> but the problem reoccurs on other pages with other js, so I'm trying to get a better handle and find a global fix
[04:32:13] <badasafish> cork: have I explained that in an understandable manner? lol
[04:43:02] <Cork> badasafish: sorry got busy
[04:43:26] <badasafish> cork: that's fine, I appreciate you even taking the chance to speak to me about it
[04:45:12] <Xatenev> Heya
[04:45:13] <Xatenev> fast question
[04:45:18] <Xatenev> $(document).ready(function(){
[04:45:18] <Xatenev>    $('video').on('ended',function(){
[04:45:18] <Xatenev>       console.log('Video has ended!');
[04:45:18] <Xatenev>    });
[04:45:18] <Xatenev> });
[04:45:23] <Xatenev> displays nothing when the video ended
[04:45:25] <Xatenev> whats wrong? :(
[04:45:39] <Uhkis> you pasting to irc, not to paste service ;-)
[04:45:56] <Xatenev> I was like: that small code, naa
[04:45:57] <Xatenev> xD
[04:46:16] <xec> it helps to have a live demo (with the video etc)
[04:46:23] <xec> try jsfiddle
[04:47:19] <Cork> badasafish: i would start by loading none minified versions of jquery
[04:47:24] <Cork> makes debugging easier
[04:49:02] <badasafish> cork: OK, that jQuery is called by Magento so please give me a moment to figure out how to change that include, I will get back to you shortly.
[04:54:17] <Cork> badasafish: the scripts is evaled so that makes finding where it comes from really hard
[04:54:44] <badasafish> cork: the include jQuery one?
[04:55:18] <Cork> no the jquery one is kinda a last resourt as the source of the problem isn't accessible
[04:55:35] <Cork> ah there it is
[04:57:46] <badasafish> cork: found what you needed to see?
[04:58:19] <IzaacJ> any tips on why the #lat and #long fields don't get a new value when #address changes? using typeahead-addresspicker and followed their example w/o luck. My Code: https://gist.github.com/IzaacJ/199fedbd5b61bd253da4 Their Example: https://github.com/sgruhier/typeahead-addresspicker#events
[04:58:30] <Cork> badasafish: you need to find where you call offCanvas
[04:58:44] <Cork> evaling makes this really hard so ya, good luck
[04:58:55] <badasafish> cork: thats part of the mmenu plugin
[04:59:07] <Cork> the plugin most likely isn't the cause
[04:59:11] <Cork> but what calls it is
[04:59:45] <Cork> somewhere you call $().mmenu(<something> <-- this is prototype not jquery
[05:00:01] <Cork> that is about as far as i've gotten in the code
[05:00:06] <Cork> and about all the time i can spend on this
[05:01:09] <badasafish> cork: ok, well I appreciate your help
[05:09:37] <andywww> is it generally considered bad to send markdown through json?
[05:10:13] <Xatenev> Question:
[05:10:28] <Xatenev> is it possible to trigger .next() inside an UL?
[05:10:40] <Xatenev> like i only want the next() element in list
[05:10:41] <xec> andywww: i'd say no, but what makes you ask?
[05:11:09] <xec> Xatenev: what do you mean by "trigger next"? it's not an event?
[05:12:14] <andywww> i’m feeding a javascript app data with a rails backend which spits out json. of all the data i want to serve, 1 of the fields is free text and i don’t want to have to break that down into seperate database fields in the back end
[05:12:46] <xec> Xatenev: also, "next" is relative, doing $("ul.something").next() will be the element following the ul (not a li)
[05:13:20] <andywww> i’m wondering if some sort of intermediate markdown to json parser is on the cards
[05:13:50] <xec> andywww: i would probably just send the markdown as a string
[05:14:06] <andywww> is there any encoding best practices?
[05:14:11] <xec> i mean, markdown to json doesn't make much sense to me
[05:14:33] <andywww> no, it’d need to be ‘undone’ on the other end i suppose
[05:14:52] <andywww> i just wanted to get some opinions before ploughing into it
[05:15:00] <Cork> andywww: simplest is normally to just send the same data you have client side to the server
[05:15:11] <Cork> and let the server do the handling
[05:15:48] <xec> andywww: markdown is just text. i'd just treat it as a string and be done with it ;)
[05:16:09] <andywww> yeah, its the linebreaks etc i’m concerned about
[05:16:12] <andywww> i’ll have a play
[05:16:14] <andywww> thanks
[05:16:48] <xec> there's no issues with having linebreaks in a string
[05:18:22] <Cork> "multi\nline\messages"
[05:18:29] <Cork> :o
[05:18:32] <Cork> "multi\nline\nmessages"
[05:18:34] <Cork> :)
[05:23:35] <Xatenev> Guys, i have a <ul>
[05:23:43] <Xatenev> an inside that <ul> i got for example 10 <li>s
[05:23:52] <Xatenev> with data-loc attributes
[05:24:06] <Xatenev> is it possible in Jquery now to get a list of all those lis with its data-loc attributes
[05:24:18] <Xatenev> like 0 > data-loc-attribute-of-li-1 1 > data-loc-...
[05:24:23] <Xatenev> u get me? :p
[05:25:25] <xec> Cork: lol. it took me way too long to spot the difference :)
[05:25:47] <Cork> :D
[05:26:47] <Cork> Xatenev: $.map($('ul li'), function(elm) { return $(elm).data('loc'); })
[05:27:44] <Xatenev> Cork: o>o
[05:27:51] <Xatenev> so i have to call .map then? .p
[05:27:58] <Xatenev> or how does that work xd
[05:28:01] <Cork> ya
[05:28:10] <Cork> else you would have a set of jquery elements
[05:28:16] <Xatenev> can u give me an example on how i call it?
[05:28:19] <Cork> Xatenev: not i used $.map and not $().map
[05:28:23] <Cork> it isn't the same function
[05:28:25] <Xatenev> <ul class="playlist">
[05:28:30] <Xatenev> for example
[05:28:33] <Xatenev> how do i call it then? x
[05:28:41] <Cork> Xatenev: $.map($('.classlist li'), function(elm) { return $(elm).data('loc'); })
[05:28:59] <Xatenev> how do i call it then
[05:29:15] <xec> Xatenev: make a demo with your markup and your attempt
[05:29:23] <Xatenev> theres no attempt
[05:29:32] <xec> then try first, before you ask
[05:29:32] <Xatenev> cause i have no idea how to call that function actually
[05:29:45] <xec> cork just gave two examples. read the docs.
[05:29:53] <Xatenev> Yup he did
[05:30:00] <Cork> Xatenev: $() selects the elements
[05:30:05] <Cork> $.map loops them
[05:30:07] <Xatenev> like normal yeah
[05:30:13] <Cork> function() grabs the loc section
[05:30:21] <Cork> and $.map returns you an array of the result
[05:30:27] <Xatenev> yup i understand that
[05:30:39] <Cork> then what are you asking about?!?
[05:30:44] <Xatenev> Cork: I just dont get how to call the function
[05:30:49] <Xatenev> like i have to write $.map(array or something
[05:30:50] <Cork> ?
[05:31:00] <xec> the () after a function/method calls it :P
[05:31:00] <Cork> you call it exactly as i gave you
[05:31:01] <Xatenev> cause its returning something, so i have to call the function somewhere
[05:31:26] <Cork> var listIOfValues = $.map($('.classlist li'), function(elm) { return $(elm).data('loc'); })
[05:31:49] <Cork> listIOfValues will then hold the array of values
[05:32:05] <Xatenev> ah rofl
[05:32:09] <Xatenev> i was completly confused
[05:32:11] <Xatenev> thanks ><
[05:32:18] <Cork> ya, i showed
[05:32:29] <Cork> you asked how to call an exact full line
[05:32:37] <Xatenev> I thought i have to call the function defnition somewhere
[05:32:38] <Cork> something that was hard to make more specific :)
[05:32:40] <Xatenev> and didnt get its already called
[05:32:49] <Xatenev> sorry ><
[05:37:12] <Xatenev> another question
[05:37:17] <Xatenev> not sure if its suited for jquery channel though
[05:38:19] <Xatenev> nevermind
[05:38:20] <Xatenev> solved
[05:39:21] <Xatenev> not solved :D
[05:39:36] <Xatenev> i got a global variable "var counter = 1;" and inside a function i make window.counter++; > doesnt work
[05:39:40] <Xatenev> why?
[05:43:25] <bacobart> Xatenev, that should work. are you sure your counter var is defined in global scope?
[05:45:20] <Xatenev> it worked like this now:
[05:45:27] <Xatenev> var counter = 0; outside and inside counter = 1;
[05:45:34] <Xatenev> but its not working with window. somehow
[05:45:40] <Xatenev> No idea why actually but it works now..
[05:45:59] <bacobart> ehm okay
[05:46:02] <caper> http://jsfiddle.net/2bygewcq/3/
[05:46:16] <caper> i want to find the id of li
[05:46:21] <caper> how ca i do that
[05:46:48] <ExtraSteve> this.id
[05:47:10] <ExtraSteve> You don't even need $(this).id - just this.id will do
[05:48:08] <caper> ExtraSteve i used same thing and also get the id but not li
[05:48:39] <ExtraSteve> oh, you could use $(this).parent.id, I think
[05:48:58] <ExtraSteve> or .parent().parent().parent()...
[05:49:06] <ExtraSteve> How ever many levels up you need to go
[05:50:05] <ExtraSteve> Looks like 2 levels if I read your html correctly. So $(this).parent().parent().id should do the trick
[05:50:34] <caper> doesnot matter how much level
[05:50:58] <ExtraSteve> I don't like doing it that way because if you change your DOM topography then it breaks your code also
[05:51:47] <caper> any other suggestion
[05:57:43] <ExtraSteve> Well, first you have two things with id=0
[05:58:06] <ExtraSteve> Which is illegal
[05:58:25] <ExtraSteve> ids should be unique throughout the entire document
[05:58:41] <caper> ok i will channge it
[06:01:48] <ExtraSteve> Also, I don't think you're allowed to start ids with numbers
[06:02:19] <ExtraSteve> Maybe that's just html4 though
[06:02:37] <caper> again i changed it
[06:02:44] <caper> actually it's test fiddle
[06:03:03] <caper> that's a reason i do some wrong thing
[06:03:18] <ExtraSteve> aahh
[06:05:15] <caper> so sorry for doing mistake
[06:05:53] <caper> i just want to know that how can i know the li id while clicking on delete button
[06:07:23] <ExtraSteve> Apparently the best future-proof way is to use .closest()
[06:07:27] <ExtraSteve> $(this).closest("li").attr('id');
[06:07:49] <ExtraSteve> That'll traverse up the DOM to find the closest parent element that is an 'li'
[06:08:05] <ExtraSteve> Regardless of how deep $(this) is
[06:08:36] <ExtraSteve> Which is ideal, because if you wrap it in another tag in the future (like an extra <span> or <b> or something) then it'll break everything if you use .parent()
[06:12:11] <ExtraSteve> caper: here's a working version: http://jsfiddle.net/2bygewcq/19/
[06:12:17] <ExtraSteve> I cleaned up some of the IDs for you
[06:12:25] <ExtraSteve> And fixed your selector
[06:20:18] <fabiobik> hi guys
[06:20:20] <caper> That's great it's work
[06:20:28] <fabiobik> how do i select a multiselect with jquery?
[06:20:50] <fabiobik> the multiselect has the options hardcoded
[06:21:13] <fabiobik> hardcoded = hand inserted
[06:34:40] <gr3yh47> https://dpaste.de/qbWA dJsonData and aJsonData both log to the console as objects with a fields attribute, but dJsonData.fields and aJsonData.fields both log as undefined, and i get an error that dJsonData.fields is undefined.
[06:34:56] <gr3yh47> i've spent a few hours on this and don't know why this is happening
[06:35:42] <DRSK> I'm doing some code with jQuery(function($){ stuff }); but that stuff is depending on a jQuery.plugin existing. Can I somehow, rather than wrap the entirty in if( jquery.plugin ) { jquery(function(... do something else?
[06:36:39] <Valduare> mornin guys
[06:37:05] <Valduare> I need to learn how to pass variables to php when opening a modal
[06:37:21] <Valduare> specifically trying to pass an id to the php in a modal
[06:37:32] <Valduare> so I know what the user clicked to open the dynamic generated modal
[06:37:36] <xec> DRSK: you could check for the plugin on the first line of the ready handler, and just return if it doesn't exist
[06:38:16] <DRSK> xec » if( ! jQuery.plugin ) return; jquery(function($).... ?
[06:38:25] <xec> no
[06:38:45] <DRSK> ohh in the ready, sorry I misread so basically first line of the *code* checks and returns false if not present?
[06:38:52] <xec> DRSK:  jQuery(function($){ if(noplugin) return; })
[06:39:01] <DRSK> thanks, that is much prettier
[06:39:45] <xec> you might also want to log a message about missing the plugin, to help yourself in the future ;)
[06:40:13] <DRSK> Ahh sweet, that is great. Good point; although some browser have issues with console.log right? So can I do something like if( console.log ) console.log() ?
[06:40:32] <DRSK> or if( window.console !== undefined ) or something ^^
[06:40:39] <xec> right
[06:41:06] <xec> or window.console && console.log("whatever")
[06:41:46] <DRSK> Care to elaborate on that one? It looks a lot like a one liner thing, would it actually execute if but in a statement?
[06:41:53] <DRSK> but=put'
[06:42:16] <xec> the && would only execute the left hand operand if it is falsy
[06:42:45] <xec> meaning it would only call console.log if console exists as a property on window
[06:43:01] <DRSK> if( ! jQuery.plugin && window.console && console.log( 'Plugin is missing' ) ) return; ~ish?
[06:43:58] <DRSK> erm, you clearly said if it's falsy it continues so that wouldn't work out too good; might wanna wrap those two at the end in their own () ?
[06:44:34] <xec> DRSK: no, i said executes *only left*
[06:44:46] <xec> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/sjv0c3us/
[06:45:42] <DRSK> Ah right, thanks xec !
[06:47:34] <DRSK> I have another question for you xec if you have the time to explain: if I do $( document ).on('click.my-thing-here' would that bind an event listener "named" my-thing-here by name only and not anything to do with a class .my-thing-here ?
[06:47:55] <xec> correct
[06:48:17] <xec> it's called an event namespace
[06:48:46] <DRSK> namespace, figures.. basically by doing that I can simply "unbind" that specific one without unbinding the entire click ?
[06:49:09] <xec> i haven't used it myself, but I would expect so
[06:49:17] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/event.namespace/
[06:49:29] <xec> doesn't say, should be easy to test though
[06:50:10] <DRSK> how about this then, umm. In that jQuery(function($){ thing }); in the thing I have a few var someThing = function() { do stuff }, 3 of them actually, such as *helpers* which are frequently used here and there in that same snippet to do stuff. But in one place I'm calling 3 of these functions, should I make a function to call them all and use that or call 3 functions separately?
[06:50:28] <DRSK> trying to put down some do's and dont's kinda thing
[06:51:37] <EC_Joe> hey guys I'm trying to use jquery's $.param function for creating a url, unfortunately in IE one of my parameters starts with reg_ so when param builds the string it's building &reg_ which is being converted to a registrtion symbol and thus breaking the url. Is there a better way to be doing this?
[06:52:03] <xec> DRSK: the namespace works as expected: http://jsfiddle.net/sjv0c3us/1/ (only namespaced is unbound)
[06:52:45] <gr3yh47> https://dpaste.de/qbWA dJsonData and aJsonData both log to the console as objects with a fields attribute, but dJsonData.fields and aJsonData.fields both log as undefined, and i get an error that dJsonData.fields is undefined.
[06:53:02] <xec> DRSK: if you're only calling the three functions *one place* i wouldn't make a separate function for it
[06:53:11] <gr3yh47> i'm not sure if this is some bizarre promise scope issue or what
[06:54:40] <xec> EC_Joe: have you looked at encodeURIComponent() ?
[06:54:50] <DRSK> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent
[06:54:54] <DRSK> ugh I was too slow ^^
[06:55:00] <xec> :D
[06:55:31] <EC_Joe> lemme give that a shot... basically I would need to just encode all key/value pairs?
[06:56:00] <xec> EC_Joe: i'm honestly not sure if it might just create new problems
[06:56:20] <xec> what you want is &amp; instead of &
[06:56:34] <xec> so a simple .replace() is probably better
[06:56:46] <EC_Joe> I guess is there a reason that the $.param function wouldn't work that way to begin with?
[06:57:08] <EC_Joe> i was going to try a .replace but figured there must have been a reason not to do that since it wasn't implemented there?
[06:57:57] <xec> EC_Joe: i'm sort of surprised the &reg gets converted, do you know exactly when that happens?
[06:58:22] <xec> EC_Joe: i mean, if it's part of a url and not displayed on the page
[06:58:55] <EC_Joe> I'm building a set of query parameters based on filters that are dynamically added to a page
[06:59:29] <DRSK> Are you building it with a hash or a GET kinda thing?
[06:59:37] <EC_Joe> GET
[06:59:50] <EC_Joe> it's ultimately being passed to window.open
[06:59:54] <xec> and you get a registration symbol on the url?
[06:59:56] <EC_Joe> to download a csv file
[07:00:03] <EC_Joe> only in internet explorer....
[07:00:04] <xec> in*
[07:00:10] <EC_Joe> but yup
[07:00:43] <xec> EC_Joe: well, &amp; instead of & should work in any browser
[07:01:13] <EC_Joe> i'll do a replace... but can anyone answer why it's not like that by default for the param function?
[07:02:00] <EC_Joe> is that function used for other stuff besides building url's or something?
[07:02:31] <xec> it should work with just & too, but i guess IE is being silly :P
[07:02:43] <EC_Joe> quite so....
[07:02:47] <xec> &amp; is a relic from the xhtml days
[07:02:59] <caper> http://jsfiddle.net/2bygewcq/20/
[07:03:10] <xec> dunno if doctype might change any behaviour
[07:03:18] <caper> not working i want to find the click item li id
[07:05:21] <xec> caper: you want to listen to clicks on the buttons or what? at the moment you're selecting "ol li" inside ".Usermodul4e , .Usermodule"
[07:06:24] <caper> Sub user user
[07:06:33] <caper> Sub user , user
[07:06:59] <xec> ? so the text that says "1. User"?
[07:07:40] <xec> caper: http://jsfiddle.net/2bygewcq/21/ for clicking buttons
[07:07:50] <EC_Joe> so... would you believe that IE is converting &amp; to & on window.open.....
[07:08:08] <xec> EC_Joe: sure
[07:08:19] <EC_Joe> which is then putting me right back to &reg
[07:08:26] <EC_Joe> which is then converting to a registration symbol :P
[07:08:33] <xec> lo
[07:08:35] <xec> lol*
[07:08:37] * EC_Joe hates IE so much....
[07:08:44] <xec> so it's converting twice? thats strange
[07:08:51] <EC_Joe> ya..... you're telling me..
[07:08:58] <EC_Joe> I'm tempted to url encode the r in reg....
[07:09:06] <EC_Joe> err character encode?
[07:09:25] <EC_Joe> there has got to be a better way...
[07:09:26] <xec> i have no idea what you should do
[07:09:40] <xec> do you own a machine gun and a gps?
[07:09:44] <caper> xec it's work but when i try this same function at my workspace it's not run
[07:10:06] <xec> HELLO NSA
[07:10:56] <xec> caper: well, there's something different then :)
[07:11:14] <caper> nothing it's same
[07:11:30] <caper> the whole click function is not run
[07:11:30] <xec> obviously not, or it would work :)
[07:11:50] <caper> i tried but not result
[07:14:13] <caper> actually my class contain image
[07:17:49] * EC_Joe cries
[07:18:04] <EC_Joe> so.. apparently chrome doesn't honor &amp; as a parameter separator?
[07:19:22] <EC_Joe> and now I know why the replace doesn't exist in the $.param function...
[07:19:23] <sacho> what?
[07:20:03] <guy> I have an element with 'mouseenter click' events. On mobile, both events are triggered after touch event. I have tried stopPropagation and stopImmediatePropagation to ensure that just one of them is. That did not work.
[07:20:06] <guy> How do I do it?
[07:20:19] <EC_Joe> script.php?a=1&amp;b=2 isn't treating b as a 2nd parameter when I use chrome :'(
[07:20:46] <sacho> why would it..?
[07:21:18] <sacho> also, "isn't treating"? who isn't treating it as a second parameter?
[07:21:29] <sacho> because browsers don't have a concept of query parameters
[07:22:17] <EC_Joe> sacho, well it's passing it forward as amp;b as the 2nd parameter instead of converting it to an ampersand
[07:22:46] <bacobart> so whatever is generating an url like that, shouldn't :P
[07:22:54] <EC_Joe> well the problem is
[07:22:58] <EC_Joe> if I have a url like
[07:23:00] <sacho> use less it
[07:23:02] <bacobart> because the server is right to interpret the variable name as "amp;b"
[07:23:30] <EC_Joe> script.php?a=1&reg=2 ie converts &reg=2 to the registration symbol = 2 when it sends it
[07:23:37] <EC_Joe> so I need to figure out some way around that >.>
[07:23:53] <EC_Joe> and IE's answer is "convert your &reg to &amp;reg"
[07:23:57] <gr3yh47> https://dpaste.de/qbWA dJsonData and aJsonData both log to the console as objects with a fields attribute, but dJsonData.fields and aJsonData.fields both log as undefined, and i get an error that dJsonData.fields is undefined.
[07:23:59] <gr3yh47> i'm not sure if this is some bizarre promise scope issue or what
[07:24:12] <sacho> gr3yh47, make a runnable example on jsfiddle
[07:24:19] <gr3yh47> sacho, i can't
[07:29:42] <Xatenev> Heya
[07:29:50] <Xatenev> I wanna select all elements with the attribute type="video/ogg"
[07:30:02] <Xatenev> $('#test[type="video/ogg"]')
[07:30:06] <Xatenev> Whats wrong hereß :(
[07:30:11] <Cork> you already have an id
[07:30:17] <Xatenev> ay
[07:30:17] <Cork> you can't be more specific then that
[07:30:22] <Xatenev> I wanna select all inside test
[07:30:25] <Cork> it will always match at most one element
[07:30:31] <Xatenev> Like I wanna select all elements with type="video/ogg" inside #test
[07:30:31] <Cork> ah your missing a space then
[07:30:40] <Cork> $('#test [type="video/ogg"]')
[07:30:46] <Xatenev> Lol really?
[07:30:51] <Xatenev> doc examples have no spcae
[07:30:52] <Xatenev> space
[07:31:15] <Cork> $('#test[type="video/ogg"]') == select the element with the id test that has an attribute type="video/ogg"
[07:31:32] <Cork> $('#test [type="video/ogg"]') == select the element that has an attribute type="video/ogg" and a parent of #test
[07:31:41] <Xatenev> Oh yea it works great now
[07:31:47] <Xatenev> what a small difference which rekt my work here :D
[07:31:50] <Xatenev> thanks<3
[07:31:54] <Cork> np :)
[07:38:33] <anix> is jQuery data() a reasonable method to store/access arbitrary data? typically arrays and objects that are less than 10k in total
[07:39:26] <anix> i just updated to query 1.11.1, if that is important
[07:52:48] <Valduare> im having hard time sending data attribute via ajax to a php script...
[07:52:56] <cjohnson> Xatenev: you could read that as #test *[type="video/ogg"] to make it more obvious what's happening
[07:53:06] <cjohnson> or you could do $('#test').find('[type="video/ogg"]')
[07:58:53] <Zumochi> If I have a jQuery function to open a new tab when a user clicks on a table row element, can I show them what URL I would direct them to? Like you would see at the bottom of your browser if you used a normal anchor.
[08:00:27] <cjohnson> you can use a tooltip
[08:00:37] <cjohnson> I don't think you can change the status bar in JS consistently anymore though
[08:09:03] <BillCriswell> Zumochi: I'd be careful about expecting new tabs to open.
[08:09:13] <Zumochi> ?
[08:09:27] <Zumochi> What do you mean?
[08:09:47] <BillCriswell> You can't guarantee something will open in a new tab.
[08:10:12] <Zumochi> How so?
[08:10:49] <BillCriswell> Because you can't do it reliably. You have no say over how the users preferences are setup.
[08:11:43] <Zumochi> Fair enough.
[08:11:51] <Zumochi> So I'm better off just using an anchor?
[08:12:29] <cjohnson> use an anchor with a target="_blank" or whatever the new HTML5 standard for that is
[08:12:33] <cjohnson> but yeah
[08:12:36] <BillCriswell> I don't know enough about the entire situation. I just read "open a new tab" and wanted to let you know you can't do that consistently.
[08:12:39] <cjohnson> you can't guarantee the browser won't capture it
[08:15:33] <BillCriswell> Wouldn't want you getting too far down the road and someone is like "This isn't opening in a new tab for me."
[08:18:13] <Zumochi> Roger that, thanks.
[08:21:57] <Kage> Is it considered acceptable to have a presistent promise for a loaded resource?
[08:24:53] <nitrospectide> If I have an API kicking out reviews in JSON, how involved is it to get a jQuery script put together that pulls that in and parses it into some markup I define?
[08:25:39] <BillCriswell> nitrospectide: Not very involved at all.
[08:25:59] <BillCriswell> $.get('reviews.json').done(function(reviews) { /* Loop through reviews and put them somewhere */ });
[08:28:41] <nitrospectide> BillCriswell: From a pseudocode/logic perspective, that makes sense, and sounds very simple. I don't think I have the necessary jquery/javascript chops to do it myself, though. I'm asking because I want to know what my expectation should be for scope if I am asking someone else to do it. It sounds like it should be less than an hour? Less than 30 min?
[08:29:53] <nitrospectide> Assuming I provide the simple markup template, and I do the CSS… the scripter just does the API tap & parsing
[08:32:13] <BillCriswell> It depends on the persons skill level. Then it can also depend on the number of fields involved, if you'd need to do any type of logic inside the fields, etc, etc. My gut is telling me no more than 2 hours, but it can be as low as 30 minutes.
[08:32:27] <BillCriswell> There's too much grey area for a hard number.
[08:33:48] <nitrospectide> BillCriswell: Completely understood. I appreciate your "sanity check" numbers.
[08:34:00] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:49:07] <jcrawford> hey guys can a jquery mobile listview be styled something like this: http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/index.html
[08:49:34] <jcrawford> i am new to jQuery UI which is why I wanted to ask before venturing down hours of r&d
[08:58:43] <Kage> how do I set a custom json parser
[08:58:47] <Kage> for ajax calls
[08:59:04] <Kage> cause json sucks and should support comments but it doesn't so I have to
[09:01:15] <Omar-> jcrawford its possible, you need to play with CSS
[09:01:29] <jcrawford> ok cool thanks i will dive in :)
[09:01:38] <BillCriswell> Kage: Would it break anything to just add a comment property?
[09:01:52] <Kage> yes
[09:07:46] <BillCriswell> Kage: Ah... yeah I dunno.
[09:08:03] <BillCriswell> Kage: What's the comment needed for? Curious
[09:45:03] <Valduare> hey guys im not having any luck passing a post_id .. im making a bootstrap modal that shows the post   so I need to get the id the user clicked on and pass it to php with some ajax
[09:45:08] <Valduare> but nothing i try is working
[09:50:19] <robertmaxrees> what have oyu tried?
[09:50:53] <Valduare> been through all the guides
[09:50:57] <Valduare> what would make it easiest
[09:51:09] <Valduare> is if I could put the modal within the loop
[09:51:17] <Valduare> but then it messes up and shows behind the backdrop
[09:51:32] <Valduare> so trying to learn a new skill and send it with ajax etc
[09:51:35] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your UX, give the modal a data-postid in your html and grab that value for the ajax.
[09:51:47] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your code, i have no context, though.
[09:52:11] <Valduare> aye I set a data-postid
[09:52:27] <Valduare> and the ajax part im having trouble with - yet it looks so simple
[09:52:36] <Valduare> so
[09:52:36] <robertmaxrees> then paste up an example of your code, because i have no clue what you're stuck on :)
[09:52:49] <Valduare> say I put my modal   template in   custom.php
[09:53:02] <robertmaxrees> it's really going to be a lot faster if you just make a fiddle.
[09:53:04] <Valduare> then in my footer.php <script> block i can put the ajax and url: custom.php
[09:56:37] <Valduare> working on fiddle robertmaxrees
[09:56:41] <robertmaxrees> awesome!
[09:58:03] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: sloppy fiddle but here are the parts http://jsfiddle.net/3ej9wjd2/
[09:58:13] <Valduare> js is in footer.php
[09:58:27] <Valduare> modal template is in inc/claim-business.php
[09:58:32] <robertmaxrees> :(
[09:58:35] <robertmaxrees> gimme the html.
[09:58:37] <robertmaxrees> not the php.
[09:59:06] <Valduare> claim-business.php is just a typical bootstrap basic modal
[09:59:09] <Valduare> it is showing the modal
[09:59:12] <robertmaxrees> and this looks about right.  this should work.
[09:59:13] <Valduare> but just not passing the id
[09:59:39] <robertmaxrees> is the click event handler even firing?
[10:00:16] <Valduare> oh ya I forgot to re-edit that
[10:00:26] <Valduare> I had given the anchor tag a class of that launcher
[10:00:54] <robertmaxrees> have you verified that the handler is even firing on your code though?
[10:00:57] <robertmaxrees> outside of this fiddle?
[10:01:18] <Valduare> forgive me , what is the handler :P
[10:01:29] <robertmaxrees> the .on('click', function() {}) part.
[10:01:36] <robertmaxrees> the function, specifically, is the handler.
[10:02:14] <robertmaxrees> this is why a (mostly) functioning example would've been nice - my guess is that the handler never actually fires, so the ajax call in turn doesn't fire, either.
[10:04:22] <Valduare> [Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error) (claim-business.php, line 0)
[10:04:43] <robertmaxrees> so that error happens when you click?
[10:04:53] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to fix your PHP, then.
[10:06:49] <Valduare> is that the right method using the click handler?
[10:07:07] <robertmaxrees> assuming that the code is running every time you click, yes.
[10:07:12] <Valduare> I was attempting to capture the data-postid of the element that was clicked
[10:07:21] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you might need a delegated listener instead though.
[10:09:03] <gr3yh47> robertmaxrees: i figured out that undefined issue with the getjson promise
[10:09:32] <gr3yh47> in .done, the arguments are arrays appropriate to the positional arguments of the getjson callback
[10:10:06] <robertmaxrees> gr3yh47 i have no clue what you're talking about :)
[10:10:09] <robertmaxrees> context?
[10:10:37] <gr3yh47> https://dpaste.de/qbWA
[10:10:44] <gr3yh47> you helped me with this on friday
[10:10:55] <robertmaxrees> oh this.
[10:10:59] <gr3yh47> and we were getting ajasondata.fields is undefined
[10:11:19] <gr3yh47> the .done gives you arrays of callback positional arguments
[10:11:20] <robertmaxrees> i vaguely remember that.
[10:11:28] <robertmaxrees> "callback positional arguments"?
[10:11:51] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah.
[10:11:56] <robertmaxrees> i see what you're saying.
[10:12:00] <gr3yh47> .getjson callback has 3 positional arguments you can use
[10:12:01] <gr3yh47> yeah
[10:12:14] <gr3yh47> so the solution was simply ajsondata[0].fields
[10:12:25] <robertmaxrees> you don't normally say "positional arguments" - and that means i munged up the callback, but awesome.
[10:12:40] <gr3yh47> what should i say instead?
[10:12:45] <robertmaxrees> just arguments.
[10:12:49] <gr3yh47> oh
[10:12:55] <gr3yh47> well as opposed to named arguments
[10:13:07] <robertmaxrees> javascript doesn't really have true "named arguments", so that's implied.
[10:13:16] <gr3yh47> i didn't know that
[10:13:22] <gr3yh47> well
[10:13:28] <gr3yh47> i probably did at some point
[10:13:51] <robertmaxrees> though this seems... weird to me.
[10:15:16] <robertmaxrees> i could have sworn that each arg in the .done() callback corresponded to each deferred passed to .when() in order.
[10:15:22] <robertmaxrees> wonder why i'm confused about that.
[10:18:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the arguments passed to the callback in .done() are each supposed to be the data passed from whatever resolved the deferred.
[10:18:07] <robertmaxrees> hrm....
[10:18:43] <gr3yh47> it doesnt
[10:18:48] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hmxa8ryy/11/
[10:18:50] <gr3yh47> it gives you all of the args in an array
[10:18:59] <robertmaxrees> not in what i just linked.
[10:19:10] <robertmaxrees> wonder what the discrepancy is.
[10:32:29] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I'm using slick slider for a carousel and would like to change the cropping proportions based on screen size.  For example, large screens would get the full image at say 3:1, and small screens would get the left and right cut off for a 1:1.  Any thoughts on how to do this?
[10:32:56] <robertmaxrees> responsive images.
[10:33:07] <MarcGuay> I will google dat.
[10:36:02] <MarcGuay> robertmaxrees: Do you suggest a particular method?  Seems to be highly debated.
[10:36:49] <MarcGuay> Ah, looks like foundation has a solution built-in, I will roll with that.
[10:36:57] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to fill in behavior on older devices, but...
[10:37:01] <robertmaxrees> hah, there you go.
[10:37:42] <MarcGuay> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[10:38:32] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/3ej9wjd2/1/
[10:40:32] <Kage> BillCriswell: Really?  What do you use comments for?
[10:42:00] <BillCriswell> Kage: To document some logic usually.
[10:42:54] <Kage> BillCriswell: to document.  there you go, that is what my comments are for
[10:43:33] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: no errors and it is successfully opening the modal with it setup this way
[10:43:35] <BillCriswell> Yeah, but there really shouldn't be any logic in JSON.
[10:43:38] <Valduare> but still null
[10:46:09] <BillCriswell> Kage: It seems like wanting to throw comments in a database table.
[10:46:32] <Kage> It isn't a database table
[10:46:47] <Kage> relational database won't work for this task
[10:46:53] <Kage> or it would be very ugly
[10:48:30] <robertmaxrees> Valduare no clue then.  try a console log of the data before you run the ajax?
[10:48:31] <Kage> not to mention massive
[10:48:43] <Valduare> k
[10:48:48] <robertmaxrees> "logic in JSON" :shudder:
[10:49:13] <robertmaxrees> Valduare if that comes up correctly, you need to fix your PHP, which I'm really no good with.
[10:49:41] <Valduare> it comes up in console.log
[10:50:01] <robertmaxrees> then you need to fix your PHP.
[10:50:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:50:52] <Valduare> in claim-business2.php  all I have is echo $_POST[‘id’];
[10:51:41] <robertmaxrees> try data: {id: id},
[10:51:46] <robertmaxrees> instead of just data: id
[10:51:55] <Valduare> k
[10:52:08] <Valduare> what does that translate to in english    ie what is that doing differently
[10:52:23] <robertmaxrees> data: id is just tossing accross the value of the id variable.
[10:52:51] <robertmaxrees> {id: id} is an object literal with one property named "id" whose value is set to the 'id' variable from before.
[10:53:20] <Valduare> still null
[10:53:21] <Valduare> hmm
[10:53:31] <robertmaxrees> dump out the entire post object in PHP.
[10:54:41] <Valduare> var_dump($_POST);  ?
[10:55:10] <robertmaxrees> i just told you I don't know anything about PHP.
[10:55:21] <ExtraSteve> Assuming you're posting the data, yes, that's how
[10:55:21] <Valduare> k heh
[10:55:45] <ExtraSteve> You can also use $_REQUEST which contains post, get, and sometimes cookie and put data
[10:55:57] <ExtraSteve> Depending on how php is configured
[10:56:10] <Valduare> array 0 is what it shows dumping $_POST
[10:56:23] <ExtraSteve> So nothing is getting posted at all
[10:56:30] <samssh> ExtraSteve, Valduare, Except that it is highly recommended that you never use $_REQUEST.
[10:56:32] <gr3yh47> robertmaxrees: thanks again for your help on that
[10:56:40] <robertmaxrees> gr3yh47 deffo
[10:56:41] <gr3yh47> promises json thing
[10:56:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[10:56:49] <ExtraSteve> samssh: yes, it's pretty dangerous.
[10:57:02] <ExtraSteve> Real easy to write over variables
[10:57:03] <robertmaxrees> for troubleshooting that shouldn't be a big deal though right?
[10:57:40] <ExtraSteve> Not for debugging, it shouldn't - but it's hard to tell whether the data was posted or getted
[10:57:59] <ExtraSteve> Valduare: are you using firefox or chrome?
[10:58:10] <samssh> Valduare, If you haven't already, you should follow the guidelines in https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Security_Cheat_Sheet
[10:58:20] <ExtraSteve> Valduare: you can inspect the request in your network console and see exactly what was sent
[10:58:26] <ExtraSteve> And how
[10:58:45] <robertmaxrees> samssh for context, they're not going to use this in production code - they're trying to figure out why an ajax call isn't working.
[11:00:28] <samssh> Yep, just trying to spread good security practice. :D
[11:02:24] <robertmaxrees> which is cool, but context can be important.
[11:04:02] <guy> I must be going insane.
[11:04:30] <guy> I have $('.element').on('blur', function (e, data) { console.log(data); });
[11:04:48] <guy> and $('.element').trigger('blur', [{foo: 'bar'}])
[11:04:55] <guy> I get data === undefined
[11:06:48] <robertmaxrees> works fine here; http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6jze5po1/1/
[11:07:39] <robertmaxrees> guy ^
[11:08:19] <guy> OMG, it gets event weirder
[11:08:27] <guy> If I do it
[11:08:27] <guy> addressInput.trigger('blur', [{foo: 'bar 1'}]); addressInput.trigger('blur', [{foo: 'bar 2'}]);
[11:08:40] <guy> then first time it is undefined, second it is {foo: 'bar 22'}
[11:08:42] <guy> 2*
[11:08:52] <guy> the two statements are after one another
[11:08:56] <guy> even*
[11:09:06] <robertmaxrees> then you have something else going on.
[11:09:07] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess.
[11:13:48] <guy> http://jsfiddle.net/fmt0m5fc/4/
[11:13:53] <guy> am I going crazy..?
[11:15:52] <robertmaxrees> let me poke.  one sec.
[11:16:15] <robertmaxrees> works for me.
[11:16:27] <guy> http://jsfiddle.net/fmt0m5fc/8/
[11:16:34] <guy> here... you are getting all console log output?
[11:16:36] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:17:05] <guy> I have tried on multiple browsers. No way this is working for you.
[11:17:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:17:12] <ExtraSteve> Doesn't work for me
[11:17:21] <ExtraSteve> When it blurs, at least
[11:17:32] <robertmaxrees> you need to submit.
[11:17:33] <ExtraSteve> clicking submit works
[11:17:37] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:17:55] <guy> Oh, just to be clear – I am clicking enter.
[11:17:57] <robertmaxrees> IE11, Chrome, and FF all work fine for me.
[11:18:12] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[11:18:17] <robertmaxrees> enter on your keyboard?
[11:18:19] <guy> Yes
[11:18:27] <guy> (which initiates "submit" event)
[11:18:29] <robertmaxrees> you're triggering the listener twice in that case.
[11:18:36] <robertmaxrees> right, it also blurs the input manually.
[11:18:55] <robertmaxrees> you're getting the same listener twice in that case.
[11:19:01] <robertmaxrees> one of which will read "undefined"\
[11:19:03] <guy> If thats the case, then where is the "bar 1" gone?
[11:19:31] <robertmaxrees> the preventDefault(); might be causing headaches?
[11:19:56] <guy> well, preventDefault ensures that form is not actually submitted.
[11:20:10] <robertmaxrees> right - i'm wondering if that and the blur are interacting in some weird way.
[11:20:12] <guy> what you say would make sense if the output was data undefined; data bar 1, etc.
[11:20:13] <robertmaxrees> i can now replicate the bug.
[11:20:31] <guy> thank God. I thought I am going insane
[11:21:14] <robertmaxrees> iiinteresting.
[11:22:12] <BillCriswell> What's going on?
[11:22:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/fmt0m5fc/8/
[11:22:23] <robertmaxrees> hit enter on the text form to submit.
[11:22:35] <robertmaxrees> notice that first trigger doesn't have data
[11:22:55] <robertmaxrees> becuase that entire trigger almost seems like it's getting 'skipped'
[11:23:03] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fmt0m5fc/10/ wtf
[11:23:13] <BillCriswell> I'm seeing them all?
[11:23:25] <robertmaxrees> hit enter on your keyboard.
[11:23:35] <robertmaxrees> inside of the search box - not by clicking "search"
[11:24:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing there's something about the combo blur/submit trigger that's causing headaches maybe?
[11:25:30] <robertmaxrees> using the input event instead works.  that must be the headache.
[11:26:42] <BillCriswell> If you throw in an extra dummy input it seems to work, so just some event order stuff getting all weird.
[11:26:50] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[11:26:53] <BillCriswell> blur before/after submit race type thing?
[11:26:59] <robertmaxrees> probably?
[11:28:28] <BillCriswell> Not sure how you'd see exactly what happens when you press enter form an input.
[11:29:03] <BillCriswell> enter from*
[11:31:36] <Velveeta> i don't think enter from an input is supposed to trigger blur
[11:31:45] <robertmaxrees> in this case it does.
[11:31:51] <Lencl> hello
[11:32:20] <Lencl> I have this: $('.joinClass').on('click', window.location='');
[11:32:22] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah, doing it here.
[11:32:32] <Lencl> this says when the class joinClass is clicked, it does the window.location=''
[11:32:33] <BillCriswell> Lencl: Need to put that in a callback.
[11:32:36] <Velveeta> but only because you're specifically triggering blur from within your submit handler right?
[11:32:49] <robertmaxrees> Lencl that code isn't value.
[11:32:51] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Just removed the trigger and the blur still happens though.
[11:32:56] <Velveeta> hmmm
[11:33:03] <robertmaxrees> you need to do .on('click', function() { /* your code here */ });
[11:33:09] <BillCriswell> Lencl: You'd need to do .on('click', function () { window.location = ''; })
[11:33:31] <robertmaxrees> Lencl are you just trying to reload the window?
[11:33:40] <Velveeta> if i remove those manual trigger calls, i don't get blur behavior
[11:33:42] <Lencl> well that code was an example. my real code is $('.joinClass').on('click', goToLink);   and goToLink function has the window.location=''
[11:33:57] <Lencl> the problem is it keeps reloading the page
[11:34:13] <robertmaxrees> that's what window.location = ''; will do, Lencl
[11:34:26] <Lencl> but it does it without a click
[11:34:30] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/fmt0m5fc/11/ nothing here?
[11:34:35] <Lencl> as soon as page loads, it does that
[11:34:37] <robertmaxrees> something is triggering the click or firing the function.
[11:34:44] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Lencl
[11:34:44] <b-ot> Lencl: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:34:47] <Velveeta> nope
[11:34:47] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I was mistaking I think.
[11:35:15] <Velveeta> robertmaxrees: what browser are you seeing the blur happen in
[11:35:27] <robertmaxrees> FF.
[11:35:33] <robertmaxrees> i could check everything else though.
[11:35:36] <Velveeta> ok let me check it there, i'm in chrome
[11:35:50] <robertmaxrees> happens in chrome.
[11:36:07] <robertmaxrees> IE11 is a little different.
[11:36:09] <Velveeta> yeah, in FF it's not happening for me either
[11:36:18] <robertmaxrees> on http://jsfiddle.net/fmt0m5fc/8/ ?
[11:36:25] <Velveeta> on 8 i believe it is
[11:36:30] <Velveeta> but not on v11
[11:36:48] <Velveeta> but that's because in v8 you're manually triggering blur inside your submit handler
[11:36:54] <robertmaxrees> IE11 is... interesting:  either
[11:36:55] <robertmaxrees> [2015:02:16:11:36:18] <robertmaxrees> on http://jsfiddle.net/fmt0m5fc/8/ ?
[11:36:55] <robertmaxrees> [2015:02:16:11:36:26] <Velveeta> on 8 i believe it is
[11:36:55] <robertmaxrees> [2015:02:16:11:36:30] <Velveeta> but not on v11
[11:36:56] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[11:36:58] <Lencl> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/
[11:36:59] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/Cgv5fHP.png
[11:37:08] <Velveeta> right
[11:37:10] <Lencl> oops
[11:37:14] <robertmaxrees> Lencl need to save first ;)
[11:37:16] <Velveeta> but that's happening by design, the way it's written
[11:37:30] <robertmaxrees> hrmm...
[11:37:39] <Velveeta> because your submit is triggering blur on that field
[11:37:41] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:37:51] <robertmaxrees> but FF and Chrome ignore that first trigger.
[11:38:06] <robertmaxrees> aaaah - I get it - preventDefault() is preventing the blue that'd happen on that input maybe?
[11:38:07] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:38:09] <Velveeta> but i see the first trigger right there in that screenshot
[11:38:41] <Velveeta> the first trigger is with {foo: 'bar 1'} and appears in the console
[11:40:49] <Lencl> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/vdqy4ykq/2/
[11:42:19] <Velveeta> lencl: you need to wrap that call in another function wrapper
[11:42:34] <Velveeta> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/vdqy4ykq/3/
[11:43:17] <Lencl> ah
[11:43:32] <Lencl> how come that is the case?
[11:43:41] <Lencl> cause when it binds it calls it right away?
[11:44:16] <Velveeta> then way you'd written it actually invokes that function and returns its result as the "function" being passed as the click handler
[11:44:46] <Velveeta> since that function doesn't actually return a result, its return is undefined, so you were essentially writing code that was interpreted like this:
[11:45:07] <Velveeta> joinClass(joinClassUrl); $('.joinClass').on('click', undefined);
[11:45:42] <Lencl> ah
[11:46:08] <Velveeta> by wrapping it in that function wrapper, you're passing that function as the callback, which when executed, then invokes your joinClass function
[11:50:31] <albedoa> http://pastebin.com/4ByQ5XaV can anyone tell me what i'm missing here? the .append function isn't appending anything
[11:51:30] <robertmaxrees> need a document ready
[11:51:34] <Velveeta> ^^ that
[11:52:04] <sacho> albedoa, there's no element with the addLine id when your code is executed
[11:52:11] <sacho> try placing your code just before the closing body tag
[11:52:18] <robertmaxrees> or using a document ready.
[11:52:23] <robertmaxrees> either/or will accomplish what you need.
[11:52:47] <guy> robertmaxrees: was there a solution at the end? or is it a bug.
[11:53:43] <albedoa> derp, i'm an idiot. thanks robertmaxrees sacho Velveeta
[11:54:02] <robertmaxrees> guy my guess is that the preventDefault() is preventing the blur from happening as well - might be worth filing a bug since you have the test case good to go.
[11:55:28] <Velveeta> but that preventDefault is being fired on the event received for the submit callback...
[11:55:53] <guy> OK
[11:55:58] <robertmaxrees> right, i'm wondering if that's also getting interpreted incorrectly in some browsers?
[11:55:59] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[11:56:12] <Velveeta> i still haven't been able to recreate whatever issue you guys are seeing...
[11:56:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/fmt0m5fc/8/ - place cursor in input, hit "enter" on keyboard.
[11:56:51] <robertmaxrees> don't click "search" - need to specifically hit "enter" on your keyboard.
[11:56:53] <notchris|work> I’m trying to remove a class from a div that is added via Facebook
[11:57:04] <notchris|work> .removeClass, and some other methods have been unable to remove this class
[11:57:25] <robertmaxrees> notchris|work is the element in an iframe or anything like that?
[11:57:41] <notchris|work> robertmaxrees: I don’t believe so, then I’d be certain it was that
[11:57:47] <notchris|work> robertmaxrees: http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/
[11:57:53] <notchris|work> on “#fb-root”
[11:58:03] <notchris|work> I cannot remove “.fb-reset”
[11:58:06] <steeze> would it make sense to add a function to a sortable.stop that updates the class names with the location in the list?
[11:58:28] <steeze> new to jquery and wondering if that's the best way to get the order of a sortable list
[11:58:39] <steeze> order of items in a sortable list*
[11:58:55] <robertmaxrees> notchris|work i was able to just fine.
[11:59:01] <robertmaxrees> because it's fb_reset.
[11:59:05] <robertmaxrees> $('#fb-root').removeClass('fb_reset'); works.
[11:59:43] <notchris|work> robertmaxrees: Still no luck with that, perhaps it’s my placement
[11:59:46] <notchris|work> Shouldn’t be though
[12:00:07] <robertmaxrees> try inside of a $(window).load()
[12:00:13] <robertmaxrees> instead of a document ready.
[12:00:18] <robertmaxrees> because that worked from within my console.
[12:00:50] <Valduare> $("#claim-business-Modal-" + $(this).data('postid')).modal();       this in a click function  should append the postid   data attribute   to the end of #claim-business-Modal-   no?
[12:01:14] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:01:34] <Valduare> i added an alert in the click function and it shows the alert
[12:01:40] <Valduare> but its not changing the id
[12:01:47] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[12:01:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to "change" anything.
[12:01:59] <notchris|work> Hmm
[12:02:04] <robertmaxrees> that's just going to select something, Valduare
[12:02:15] <notchris|work> robertmaxrees: Still no luck with window load
[12:02:17] <notchris|work> interesting
[12:02:17] <Valduare> oh
[12:02:18] <guy> robertmaxrees: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2095
[12:02:40] <robertmaxrees> guy yep - i'm in the dev chat channel, too :) saw it.
[12:02:48] <robertmaxrees> share one of your fiddles in there.
[12:02:51] <robertmaxrees> *the bug report, i mean.
[12:02:56] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: I was doing some more tinkering and apparently the ajax was not posting anything
[12:03:07] <robertmaxrees> Valduare weird.  wonder why.
[12:03:12] <guy> Done
[12:03:14] <guy> Got to go
[12:03:17] <robertmaxrees> guy ++ thank you!
[12:03:25] <Valduare> no clue, so im trying to find another way to get the id into the modal
[12:03:38] <robertmaxrees> setup a functioning fiddle please.
[12:03:40] <Valduare> basically im just trying to open a post in a modal
[12:03:55] <robertmaxrees> you're going ot bang your head against the wall trying to get help until you do that.
[12:04:08] <Valduare> its so heavily tied up in wordpress
[12:04:16] <Valduare> no clue how i’d setup a functional jsfiddle
[12:04:17] <robertmaxrees> the html and js aren't.
[12:04:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kqpcesft/ this has jq and bootstrap included already for you.
[12:04:56] <robertmaxrees> just needs your code.
[12:05:08] <narcarsiss> Does anyone know why Jquery is not Firing untill i Resize my browser Window?
[12:05:28] <robertmaxrees> narcarsiss i doubt that's the case.  you probably have logic reliant on a window resize event.
[12:05:30] <BillCriswell> I imagine you have your code wrapped in a resize event.
[12:05:47] <Valduare> k i’ll take a look at it
[12:06:09] <Valduare> how can I setup a functional fiddle if I cant have it feed to a php script to process the ajax post?
[12:06:14] <narcarsiss> robertmaxrees: I'll re check my code. thanks.
[12:06:23] <robertmaxrees> Valduare you can comment out the ajax call bit for now.
[12:06:29] <robertmaxrees> but supply all of your code.
[12:06:32] <robertmaxrees> *relevant code.
[12:07:58] <Valduare> k
[12:10:01] <narcarsiss> bait: Long time no see D:
[12:10:06] <bait> hey hey
[12:10:54] <bait> so still having this issue with jquery plugins not firing immediately
[12:11:08] <bait> 2-3 sec delay or immediate if you resize window
[12:11:44] <robertmaxrees> bait no way for us to know without seeing your page.
[12:11:50] <bait> http://rgd.deft-dev.com.au/residential
[12:11:59] <bait> dont judge too harsh haha
[12:12:04] <bait> its the sliders
[12:12:06] <robertmaxrees> your document ready is taking forever to fire.
[12:12:22] <narcarsiss> I have the same Issue. I'll keep an eye on you two.
[12:12:36] <robertmaxrees> bait you have a javascript error first thing on the page.
[12:12:37] <robertmaxrees> fiux that.
[12:12:55] <ircbaako> 6
[12:13:59] <notchris|work> robertmaxrees: http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/
[12:14:04] <notchris|work> Look at fb-root
[12:14:11] <notchris|work> And look at how font-size is crossed out
[12:14:14] <robertmaxrees> notchris|work it shows as fb_root for me.
[12:14:18] <notchris|work> Exactly
[12:14:25] <notchris|work> Unclick the crossed out property
[12:14:41] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/kqpcesft/2/
[12:14:41] <notchris|work> It will still only show the crossed out property
[12:14:44] <robertmaxrees> you realize i use a different browser, right, notchris|work ?
[12:15:05] <notchris|work> robertmaxrees: I didn’t realize that until you just told me that information.
[12:15:08] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:15:14] <notchris|work> ;)
[12:15:17] <robertmaxrees> notchris|work if you have a CSS problems, i'd check out #css and see what they have to say.
[12:15:30] <notchris|work> AKA hit up emerson
[12:15:32] <notchris|work> lol
[12:15:36] <robertmaxrees> or the whole channel.
[12:15:49] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: I didnt know exactly what you wanted to comment out the ajax so i left it as its part of the call model
[12:15:54] <Valduare> modal
[12:16:24] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kqpcesft/3/ this is what i was trying to get you to do earlier.
[12:17:08] <bait> robertmaxrees ok i have fixed that js error - that was a joomla error (my hatred for joomla increases)
[12:17:20] <Valduare> ya it just wont pop up the modal if the ajax does not succeed.
[12:17:37] <Valduare> would have to switch it to data-target in the anchor to pop it up
[12:18:05] <Valduare> but getting the modal to pop up isnt hte problem   its how do I pass the post id into the modal to use as php variable
[12:18:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kqpcesft/5/ try something like this.
[12:18:39] <robertmaxrees> with the ajax uncommented obviously.
[12:18:57] <robertmaxrees> if you still get errors, then I dunno what to tell you.
[12:19:25] <robertmaxrees> bait the other issue is your document ready takes a while to fire.
[12:19:46] <bait> ok, but wouldnt that just effect the initial loading?
[12:19:58] <robertmaxrees> and all the stuff that relies on it firing to load.
[12:20:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd read this to dissuade you from carousels in the first place.: http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[12:20:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd also highly suggest that you compress your images as much as possible.
[12:20:39] <robertmaxrees> becuase your page is pretty heavy.
[12:20:54] <bait> the main issue i am having, is when you click on a different on a different tab in the accordian, there is a 2-3 sec delay
[12:21:26] <robertmaxrees> even after evertything has loaded?
[12:21:29] <bait> yes
[12:21:40] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: is it suppose to change my browser url?
[12:21:50] <Valduare> im not familiar with ajax at all heh
[12:21:55] <robertmaxrees> Valduare nope.
[12:21:59] <bait> at the moment, i have the same slider on a couple of the tabs, and even tried pre-loading the images
[12:22:20] <bait> it doesnt seem to be an issue with the loading speed
[12:22:21] <robertmaxrees> eeeh...
[12:22:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's becuase of the cutesy animations.
[12:22:43] <robertmaxrees> is there any way i could encourage you to not use carousels in the first place?
[12:22:51] <bait> talk to the guy im doing the site for
[12:22:54] <bait> lol
[12:23:00] <bait> ive already tried talking him out of it
[12:23:26] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm.
[12:25:17] <bait> the entire delay is actually in processing the js... but noone else that uses same plugin finds any issue with it.... ive tried other plugins like owl carousel, and they had same issue
[12:25:41] <robertmaxrees> "in processing the JS"?
[12:28:01] <catuca> I wrote code to pull gallery photos from Flickr. Nothing fancy dance. Just something to start learning JS. Here is my mess: http://pastebin.com/KXVHYpRS How do I pass this.result into the getGalleryPhotos method?
[12:28:53] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass around callbacks.
[12:28:58] <bait> robertmaxrees http://i.imgur.com/z80cXkn.png
[12:29:00] <robertmaxrees> because ajax, async, and race conditions :D
[12:29:09] <catuca> robertmaxrees: oh jeez..you are right
[12:29:12] <robertmaxrees> bait right - "painting"
[12:29:21] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: maybe this has something to do with the files all this code is in?
[12:29:26] <bait> 0.100ms of the time is "painting"
[12:29:29] <catuca> robertmaxrees: wait a minute...let me rethink that
[12:29:35] <robertmaxrees> bait crr related.
[12:29:42] <robertmaxrees> *css
[12:30:09] <robertmaxrees> you're using carousels inside of accordions, which is pretty hacky to begin with.
[12:30:09] <bait> out of 3.01s only 0.100ms is "painting" tho
[12:30:43] <robertmaxrees> what does your click event handler look like?
[12:30:46] <robertmaxrees> for those accordions?
[12:31:07] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Can you help me?
[12:31:17] <bait> it did the same thing outside of the accordions just using .hide() and .show()
[12:31:40] <robertmaxrees> i need to see your code.
[12:31:47] <robertmaxrees> catuca you said you need to rethink it... what do you need?
[12:31:55] <catuca> robertmaxrees:  http://pastebin.com/KXVHYpRS
[12:32:06] <robertmaxrees> catuca i can read - what specifically?
[12:32:10] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass around callbacks.
[12:32:42] <catuca> robertmaxrees: look at line 91
[12:32:57] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:33:00] <robertmaxrees> what are you confused about?
[12:33:10] <catuca> robertmaxrees: that needs to be passed into getGalleryPhotos
[12:33:14] <robertmaxrees> instead of this.result = result; you need to call gallery.getGalleryPhotos instead.
[12:33:29] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I tried that...it doesn't like "gallery"
[12:33:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:33:45] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I know. I am puzzled too
[12:33:50] <catuca> robertmaxrees: let me try this again
[12:33:52] <robertmaxrees> fiddle.
[12:34:01] <catuca> robertmaxrees: alright, will fiddle it
[12:34:17] <catuca> robertmaxrees: but you won't be able to run it without an API KEY and a valid gallery ID
[12:34:24] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[12:34:25] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[12:34:36] <catuca> robertmaxrees: let me retry it...be back soon
[12:36:33] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'gallery' of undefined
[12:37:00] <catuca> robertmaxrees: that happens if you call getGalleryPhotos from within the callback for compoundId
[12:37:06] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:37:09] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k
[12:38:25] <robertmaxrees> var gallery = new flickr; isn't right btw.
[12:38:38] <catuca> robertmaxrees: advise?
[12:38:39] <robertmaxrees> var gallery = new flickr();
[12:38:52] <catuca> robertmaxrees: oh
[12:39:14] <catuca> robertmaxrees: flickr is a contructor method...not a class, right?
[12:39:22] <robertmaxrees> javascript doens't have classes ;)
[12:39:28] <catuca> robertmaxrees: lol ;)
[12:39:32] <robertmaxrees> it really doesn't.
[12:39:42] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I come from a server side world...sorry
[12:39:56] <robertmaxrees> you can try to do pseudoclassical inheritance with it, but you'll wind up scratching your head a lot because its inheritance mechanism is based on prototypes.
[12:40:08] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k
[12:40:24] <robertmaxrees> this is why i usually push people away from constructors and to go towards a more functional style.
[12:40:47] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I will get there..just not yet. I need to learn how to make this code work
[12:41:02] <catuca> robertmaxrees: it is puzzling that it won't call a method within another method callback
[12:41:03] <robertmaxrees> easy peasy
[12:41:20] <robertmaxrees> why are you using constructors here?
[12:41:28] <robertmaxrees> do you plan on creating a bunch of flickr instances?
[12:41:52] <catuca> robertmaxrees: That pattern allows me to set all those settings variables and then share it across all methods. that's what I need
[12:42:31] <robertmaxrees> there are ways to do that with POJOs and a functional style, but if you're set on constructors, one sec.
[12:42:39] <catuca> robertmaxrees: you will instantiate it once and then call the methods
[12:43:03] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I am not set on my ways...let's talk funtional then
[12:44:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wpyvpf1w/
[12:44:30] <robertmaxrees> you'
[12:44:39] <catuca> checking it out
[12:44:42] <robertmaxrees> *you'll have ot fill in the caps for your prototypes, but the basic gist works.
[12:44:50] <robertmaxrees> if you want the different style, let me know and i'll show you.
[12:45:09] <zagrippa> does anyone have a good method of finding out what is holding up the DOM from being ready on a page? the page appears to be loading and loading but doesn't finish, so the things I do in the jquery dom ready function don't run for several minutes. any tips?
[12:45:27] <robertmaxrees> open your network panel and see.
[12:45:43] <zagrippa> robertmaxrees: yeah i've done that on Chrome
[12:45:51] <robertmaxrees> and nothing?
[12:45:54] <zagrippa> it indicates that it has loaded faster than it does
[12:46:05] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[12:46:06] <zagrippa> also, i seem to have worse problems on mobile but don't know how to troubleshoot that
[12:47:03] <catuca> robertmaxrees: You didn't do anything that I hadn't already done
[12:47:12] <catuca> robertmaxrees: That code causes an error
[12:47:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:47:18] <robertmaxrees> no it doesn't.
[12:47:35] <robertmaxrees> I'm seeing the console.log you're looking for.
[12:48:01] <catuca> robertmaxrees: This method flickr.prototype.getGalleryPhotos = function(data) { never gets data
[12:48:26] <robertmaxrees> in that fiddle?  sure it does.  works fine.
[12:49:03] <catuca> robertmaxrees: the fiddle does, not my code which is doing the same thing as yours
[12:49:19] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[12:49:25] <robertmaxrees> you weren't running the constructor as a function.
[12:49:32] <catuca> catuca: i changed the last lines to have the getGalleryPhoto pass result from within the other method callback
[12:49:50] <robertmaxrees> and you're doing var gallery = new flickr(); right?
[12:49:52] <robertmaxrees> not var gallery = new flickr;
[12:50:11] <catuca> robertmaxrees: checking...
[12:50:42] <catuca> robertmaxrees: can I paste 4 lines of code here without getting banned?
[12:50:47] <robertmaxrees> fixee it pls.
[12:50:53] <catuca> k
[12:52:03] <catuca> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/wpyvpf1w/1/
[12:52:26] <robertmaxrees> and what was the error you were getting?
[12:52:37] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'gallery' of undefined
[12:52:43] <catuca> robertmaxrees: line 31
[12:53:02] <robertmaxrees> that means the data is not structured the way you think it is.
[12:53:33] <robertmaxrees> because in lookupGalleryCompoundId, you don't pass anything to that callback.
[12:53:36] <robertmaxrees> you just invoke it.
[12:53:58] <robertmaxrees> also, success: myCallback() doesn't do what you think it does.
[12:54:02] <catuca> robertmaxrees: looking it up
[12:54:07] <robertmaxrees> it's running the function immediately and then assigning the return value to success.
[12:54:10] <robertmaxrees> drop the ()
[12:54:31] <robertmaxrees> should just be success: myCallback,
[12:54:36] <catuca> robertmaxrees: wow..that was the issue
[12:54:47] <catuca> robertmaxrees: you nailed it
[12:55:17] <catuca> robertmaxrees: cool thank you
[12:55:31] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[12:55:38] <catuca> robertmaxrees: now..let me ask you a question
[12:55:59] <catuca> robertmaxrees: when you look at that code...as far as it being modular and such..what do you think of it?
[12:56:17] <robertmaxrees> i think it's a little heavy-handed personally.
[12:56:46] <catuca> robertmaxrees: explain and please don't be afraid to criticize
[12:57:01] <robertmaxrees> i hate constructors.  a lot.  they always wind up missing the mark.
[12:57:15] <robertmaxrees> especially in cases like this where you're only instatiating one object, not many.
[12:57:26] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k
[12:57:35] <catuca> robertmaxrees: mind showing a better route than that?
[12:57:36] <robertmaxrees> also, what's with that $.each(); ?
[12:57:58] <cannap> Hi
[12:58:02] <catuca> robertmaxrees: well, I need to loop over the response and append every photo to the grid
[12:58:08] <catuca> robertmaxrees: don't I need to use an each?
[12:58:25] <cannap> any know why $('body').mouseleave is not working all the time? any time i see console.log('out') but then i try again nothing...
[12:58:41] <robertmaxrees> catuca then just grap the photosize.
[12:58:43] <cannap> yes i know jsfiddle
[12:58:47] <robertmaxrees> instead of through everything.
[12:58:51] <catuca> robertmaxrees: That would be the equivalent to "for looping" in syncronous code.
[12:59:10] <robertmaxrees> catuca i know what loops are ;)
[12:59:11] <catuca> robertmaxrees: What if I need everything?
[12:59:19] <robertmaxrees> why are you assigning a bunch of extra vars you don't need them now?
[12:59:30] <catuca> robertmaxrees: let me look over the code again
[13:00:17] <catuca> robertmaxrees:  You are right. I don't have a need for it now. But I am thining of getting those now for use later. anything wrong with that?
[13:00:32] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:00:34] <robertmaxrees> wasting memory.
[13:00:37] <catuca> robertmaxrees: bandwidth
[13:00:40] <robertmaxrees> mental overhead for other people.
[13:00:41] <catuca> robertmaxrees: memory
[13:00:51] <robertmaxrees> tons of reasons to not declare unused variables.
[13:01:00] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:01:02] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Talk to me about the object oriented part of it. How did I do?
[13:01:06] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k
[13:15:55] <catuca> robertmaxrees: following you on github
[13:35:56] <_blizzy_> so, I'm running this, https://gist.github.com/VBlizzard/5ef12b071f83f58985fd, however, it won't alert that it's done. however, it still deletes the object.
[13:38:15] <bait> _blizzy_ have you tried success instead of "done"
[13:40:47] <sacho> _blizzy_, use your developer tools to provide a more meaningful description of what's going on
[13:41:04] <sacho> for example, in chrome's developer tools, you could look at the network tab and see the request you made and the response you got
[13:41:19] <sacho> also, you can use its debugger to figure out which parts of your code were called
[13:41:58] <_blizzy_> well I'm using firefox. c:
[13:42:00] <_blizzy_> but ok.
[13:42:30] <bait> _blizzy_ i would try something like http://pastebin.com/k0YNC2Uw
[13:43:38] <sacho> _blizzy_, firefox also has developer tools with the same functionality
[13:44:12] <sacho> _blizzy_, also add a .fail() handler and add a breakpoint in it to figure out if it's being called
[13:45:51] <jayjo> Is it possible to have jquery 'observing' items that are appended to the page with javascript/jquery?
[13:46:23] <jayjo> Eg. $('#newly-created-link').click( function () { //do stuff here}); when #newly-created-link is being created with javascript
[13:47:17] <sacho> see the delegation documentation on .on()
[13:49:38] <_blizzy_> so, I'm getting a 500 error
[13:49:45] <_blizzy_> however, it still deletes it.
[13:51:46] <jayjo> sacho: thanks
[13:54:57] <_blizzy_> idk why I'm getting a 500 error.
[13:58:18] <sacho> well, debug your backend
[14:06:11] <robertmaxrees> also: .done() is the sexy new hotness - i usually suggest you use that instead of success;
[14:10:59] <Lencl> is there anything wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/vdqy4ykq/2/
[14:11:16] <Lencl> I get the error that e is not defined
[14:11:47] <robertmaxrees> we talked about this earlierl.
[14:11:52] <robertmaxrees> $('.joinClass').on('click', joinClass(joinClassURL)); isn't what you want.
[14:12:39] <Lencl> ohh my bad
[14:12:42] <Lencl> I didn't save it
[14:12:59] <Lencl> here's the link again: http://jsfiddle.net/vdqy4ykq/4/
[14:13:25] <robertmaxrees> you don't have jquery on that fiddle
[14:14:39] <robertmaxrees> you're also tripping yourself up with variables and scope. declare that function before your document ready.
[14:16:03] <Lencl> is that for better style?
[14:16:11] <robertmaxrees> that's to make it work.
[14:16:16] <robertmaxrees>  var purchaseClass = function(e) {
[14:16:17] <robertmaxrees>  	e.preventDefault();
[14:16:17] <robertmaxrees>  	console.log("purchaseClass called");
[14:16:17] <robertmaxrees>  }
[14:16:18] <robertmaxrees> fff
[14:16:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vdqy4ykq/6/
[14:17:46] <Lencl> ah
[14:17:48] <Lencl> what's fff
[14:18:24] <robertmaxrees> lol ignore that.
[14:18:33] <robertmaxrees> i accidentally pasted the hanbdler code in chat.
[14:18:40] <robertmaxrees> that was a bad thing to do.
[14:18:47] <Lencl> lol ok
[14:22:43] <Lencl> hmm
[14:23:43] <Lencl> i have another code that does not give me that error and yet the function is after the document.ready with the variables
[14:40:25] <fartface> This is probably a simple question, but I can't for the life of me think of how to write the query.  I've got some HTML (http://pastebin.com/6BfZuhsn), and I'm looking to get back <p>Some Text</p> but NOT <p>More Text</p>.  I'm trying using $('div.group p').each(), but that'll give back both instances
[14:40:45] <robertmaxrees> use .filter();
[14:41:51] <robertmaxrees> is this your actual HTML?
[14:42:17] <fartface> No, it's a gross simplification lol
[14:42:20] <fartface> Want the actual HTML?
[14:42:31] <robertmaxrees> you're not actually nesting the same class within itself though, right?
[14:43:35] <fartface> Yes, but there are no styles associated with it--it's purely for function.
[14:43:47] <robertmaxrees> that's not generally what you want to do.
[14:44:00] <fartface> In this case I think it's necessary.
[14:44:06] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to nest classes like that, i'd try to be a little more semantic with how you're doing it.
[14:44:37] <fartface> How so?
[14:44:54] <robertmaxrees> depends on the case.
[14:45:07] <fartface> One sec
[14:45:58] <fartface> http://pastebin.com/h4JKseD1
[14:46:26] <fartface> So basically I've got a dataset loaded in via xml (don't ask--it's not preferred), and I'm using jQuery to populate this form.
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2wr8w3qd/ sure
[14:46:49] <robertmaxrees> so where are you nesting?
[14:47:08] <robertmaxrees> *the same class in itself i mean.
[14:47:51] <fartface> div.repeating-group
[14:49:18] <fartface> robertmaxrees: But I'm only querying by ID, not by the class there
[14:49:35] <robertmaxrees> but you want the "outer" one.
[14:49:52] <fartface> robertmaxrees: So I'm trying to query for each input, select, and textarea within each group, but not anything deeper than one .repeating-group level
[14:50:00] <fartface> Exactly
[14:50:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's hacky.
[14:50:38] <fartface> Without taking too much of your time, what should I search to learn more about a better way to do it?
[14:50:42] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:50:58] <robertmaxrees> rename stuff.  class="repeating-group outer" and then use classnames on the inputs you care about.
[14:51:12] <robertmaxrees> source-group-internal and source-group-external or w/e
[14:51:33] <robertmaxrees> the way you're doing it now, you're saying that the outer and inner repeating-group are the same, but they're not.
[14:52:34] <fartface> But they *are* related though
[14:52:38] <robertmaxrees> they're related.
[14:52:40] <robertmaxrees> but they're not the same.
[14:52:52] <robertmaxrees> what's the difference between the two?
[14:54:11] <fartface> How do you mean?
[14:54:19] <fartface> logically?
[14:54:26] <robertmaxrees> in practice - ignore code.
[14:54:34] <robertmaxrees> what's the distinction between them?
[14:55:08] <fartface> Think of them like a nested object, I guess--I'm trying to think of how to describe it.
[14:55:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:55:19] <robertmaxrees> you're trying too hard.
[14:55:56] <robertmaxrees> in the UX, what's the difference?  think of the statement "the outer one is X, while the inner one is Y"
[14:58:59] <robertmaxrees> "
[14:59:31] <robertmaxrees> "well, the other one contains all of the contact groups, while the inner ones are each of the individual contact groups"
[15:00:27] <fartface> Ah, I understand what you're saying, but the answer to that varies on the group
[15:01:10] <robertmaxrees> lol you're being overly specific - "the outer one is a group of things, the inner one is an individual thing"
[15:01:13] <robertmaxrees> right?
[15:02:41] <fartface> In a sense--the inner one can also be a group of things as well, they can be nested
[15:03:01] <robertmaxrees> how deeply can that go?
[15:03:05] <robertmaxrees> indefinite?
[15:03:08] <fartface> Yeah
[15:03:28] <fartface> I'm building an interface for this completely janky assed system that I absolutely hate, if I'm being honest.
[15:03:40] <robertmaxrees> we can make iot less painful :)
[15:03:52] <fartface> If only that were actually true lol
[15:03:58] <robertmaxrees> that's what we're doing now.
[15:04:03] <fartface> But from this perspective, that's what I'm working on now--exactly lol
[15:04:17] <fartface> Assuming that I have no control over the HTML, though
[15:04:20] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:04:23] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you'd rather just move on
[15:04:31] <robertmaxrees> so you want .filter and .parents()
[15:05:49] <fartface> Cheers, I'm looking into filter, but can't connect the dots as I've been working on this project (not this specific issue) for days and my brain is mush lol
[15:06:21] <fartface> And I apologize for seemingly wiping my ass with a hula hoop on this one (i.e. going round and round but accomplishing nothing) with my questions lol
[15:06:28] <robertmaxrees> it's fine.
[15:20:36] <fartface> robertmaxrees:  I feel like I'm close with .filter(), cheers.
[15:21:42] <fartface> My function that's using the query is passed the outer group ID, so I'm creating a filter rule that says "if $(this).closest('.repeating-group').attr('id') === group_id, include this"
[15:21:44] <fartface> If that makes sense
[15:22:11] <Velveeta> you just want the top level group right?
[15:25:43] <fartface> Yeah, basically if the input is contained within a div with the class of repeating-group, and the ID of repeating-group matches the ID that's passed, include that.
[15:26:12] <Velveeta> gotcha
[15:26:37] <fartface> ID of the *closest* repeating-group matches the ID that's passed
[15:29:02] <Velveeta> yeah, you could also generically do it (without knowing the id of the outer group) by doing something like: $(this).parents('.repeating-group').length === 1
[15:32:18] <fartface> But then when I want to apply the same function to the inner groups, it wouldn't work
[15:32:38] <Velveeta> i didn't think you wanted to apply the function to the inner groups, just the outermost ones
[15:36:20] <fartface> Ah, I see where the confusion is.
[15:36:38] <fartface> I *do*, but I want them to be processed separately.
[15:36:56] <knownasilya> hello all! is it possible to do an ajax request with FormData and json?
[15:37:05] <fartface> lol I think I'll just figure it out and then paste the solution because I think I've confused everyone.
[15:38:31] <fartface> Got it!
[15:39:17] <fartface> Here's how I did it: http://pastebin.com/vEvsyM54
[15:40:16] <fartface> This way I can have another function that goes through and finds each ".repeating-group" and populates it accordingly without trying to go into the deeper groups--the '.repeating-group' each function will handle them accordingly.
[15:40:54] <Velveeta> also, are those inputs/selects/textareas direct children of the groups you're targeting?
[15:41:04] <fartface> No, they're not
[15:41:07] <Velveeta> ok
[15:41:08] <fartface> That's why it's tricky.
[15:41:28] <fartface> And while I'll have control of the HTML for the next iteration of this project, for this iteration, I won't.
[15:41:28] <Velveeta> you should also be able to simplify that somewhat by using "#group_id :input"
[15:41:38] <Velveeta> :input should also target selects and textareas
[15:41:47] <fartface> Oh?  Well shit, thanks!
[15:41:50] <Velveeta> :)
[15:41:53] <fartface> That *does* simplify the code.
[15:42:31] <fartface> Yep!  that works a treat, awesome!
[15:42:36] <Velveeta> knownasilya: you should be able to pass an ajax request with both formdata and json, but you'd have to pass the json as just another form field of data, which the back end would know it needed to decode
[15:43:20] <wa5ted> Velveeta: mind directing me to some info on :input, ive heard of it, seen it a few times, but want to read more o nthe spec
[15:43:36] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[15:43:50] <wa5ted> so its for jquery only
[15:43:54] <wa5ted> or is it a css selector
[15:44:09] <Velveeta> it's jquery only
[15:44:21] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure anyway
[15:44:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, JQ only.
[15:45:16] <wa5ted> i see, no wonder
[15:45:19] <wa5ted> interesting
[17:43:28] <ruibritopt> hey people, I am loading dynamic pages into a div with no problem, but how do I add the js and css of that page when I load them into the div?
[17:58:24] <trewd6> how come this line execute on page load? $("body").click(function () {
[18:12:15] <trewd6> how come the function executes on page load? $("body").click(function () { }
[18:27:44] <w1z> hey
[19:05:49] <chequers> hi, what's the sensible way to add an element to another? I have been using $( "whatever" ).append("<img src="foo" class="bar">") -- but is it recommended to append things in one line like that, or do people typically compose the subobject in a couple of lines
[19:07:20] <cjohnson> depends on how much code is involved for hte sub object
[19:07:24] <cjohnson> or if I need to retain a reference to it
[19:07:48] <cjohnson> in your case I'd feel okay with that. but any more attributes and I'd look at breaking it apart
[19:08:04] <chequers> makes sense
[19:08:11] <cjohnson> also obviously you have a syntax error ;P
[19:08:18] <chequers> indeed :)
[19:18:45] <symfonius> hello - what are the common causes for jquery not running?
[19:18:51] <symfonius>     $(document).ready(function() {         alert('test'); }
[19:18:56] <symfonius> ie. that isn't producing an alert
[19:19:12] <symfonius> <script src="{{ asset('bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js') }}"></script> is *before* that code
[19:19:40] <symfonius> jquery.min.js is definitely being loaded
[19:21:07] <cjohnson> step one in javascript: open your console
[19:22:17] <cjohnson> also, don't give us server psuedo-code
[19:22:21] <cjohnson> just give us the HTML it outputs
[19:42:51] <_blizzy_> so, this is working. https://gist.github.com/VBlizzard/1f06dee01635360278ef I get a 200 status, which is good. however, the alert won't happen.
[19:42:59] <symfonius> cjohnson: 1) yes i had looked in my console. I changed alert to console.log and nothing is output
[19:43:06] <symfonius> 2) this is my exact code: http://pastebin.com/8yNGukmc
[19:43:36] <symfonius> It's not psuedo code, I'm using symfony and that's they way assets like js files are included
[19:44:30] <cjohnson> symfonius: view the source for the page. *That* is the real HTML
[19:44:50] <cjohnson> whatever your backend is, it doesn't matter. don't paste your backend code, paste the rendered HTML output (from view: source)
[19:45:56] <cjohnson> symfonius: where is your <script> from the paste located in the page?
[19:46:42] <symfonius> cjohnson, this is the code as copied from view source
[19:46:42] <symfonius> http://pastebin.com/Ms0YSSEV
[19:46:44] <cjohnson> you're getting nothing whatsoever in the console? that code is just running, doing nothing, and not spitting out any errors? no "$ is undefined" or anything? check network tab and filter to js files
[19:46:53] <symfonius> the script is at the bottom of </body>
[19:47:17] <symfonius> (ie. the next line after that is </body>)
[19:47:48] <cjohnson> right
[19:47:53] <symfonius> that's right cjohnson - no errors in console
[19:48:01] <cjohnson> can you link me to your page
[19:48:09] <_blizzy_> so.
[19:48:10] <symfonius> it's on localhost
[19:48:13] <symfonius> so no :(
[19:48:14] <_blizzy_> about what I posted.
[19:48:23] <cjohnson> upload it somewhere maybe
[19:48:29] <cjohnson> what you're saying doesn't add up
[19:48:53] <cjohnson> or give me your IP if you're not behind a firewall even
[19:49:12] <symfonius> I'll try and do something on jsfiddle, i'm using the SB admin bootstrap template so perhaps i can recreate it
[19:50:21] <_blizzy_> so, https://gist.github.com/VBlizzard/1f06dee01635360278ef, I'm getting a 200 status code, however, the alert isn't happening.
[19:53:22] <cjohnson> maybe the error callback is being called?
[19:55:57] <_blizzy_> hmm, IDK, cjohnson.
[19:56:28] <symfonius> I tried it on the sbadmin template and it worked :(
[19:57:27] <symfonius> if I do alert('test'); outside of the $(document).ready() then it works fine
[20:04:57] <_blizzy_> thanks, symfonius and cjohnson.
[21:12:14] <symfonius> hello
[21:12:27] <symfonius> say I have 3 buttons which act as dropdown menus (bootstrap)
[21:12:34] <symfonius> they all have the class .dropdown-menu
[21:12:50] <symfonius> I currently use this to update them:
[21:12:51] <symfonius>     $(".dropdown-menu").on('click', 'li a', function(){         $(".btn:first-child").text($(this).text());         $(".btn:first-child").val($(this).text());     });
[21:13:06] <symfonius> but that means whenever any dropdown is clicked, it updates the text on ALL three
[21:13:19] <symfonius> how do I make it just update the box that was clicked and not the others?
[21:15:13] <hanuman> hi

[21:34:25] <symfonius_> opensourceress: I lost my internet connection for a moment
[22:32:55] <PenguinMan98> I have an established site that has been running for two years with a bit of jquery code to show/hide a panel
[22:33:10] <PenguinMan98> Today, that panel isn't working in Chrome but it is in Firefox
[22:33:24] <PenguinMan98> I would love to believe this is some temporary problem with just my chrome
[22:33:32] <Woet> link the site or reproduce it on www.jsfiddle.net
[22:33:38] <PenguinMan98> Other users using chrome claim it works fine
[22:33:51] <PenguinMan98> I'll work on it, thanks
[22:35:00] <Uhkis> sounds like some addon breaking it
[22:48:09] <PenguinMan98> Well, it's odd because a console log statement runs just before it enters an animation but the one that should execute after the animation finishes never fires.
[22:49:19] <PenguinMan98> And the effects of the animation do not display
[22:49:38] <PenguinMan98> but if I manually change the css, it works
[22:50:00] <PenguinMan98> And as I said, it works perfectly in Firefox
[22:50:14] <PenguinMan98> maybe I should just reboot the pc
[22:50:58] <PenguinMan98> other javascripts on that page aren't firing either
[22:51:06] <PenguinMan98> but no errors are in the console
[23:17:10] <PenguinMan98> reboot didn't help. dammit
[23:22:50] <MeaCoder> Hi, is jquery UI is best select for create a website UI.....i think jquery Ui is very heavy for making a for example wordpress template?
[23:23:15] <MeaCoder> is my think true....
[23:24:03] <PenguinMan98> jQuery UI automates some normally onerous coding tasks.  You need only include the code for the tasks you want and not the rest.
[23:24:13] <PenguinMan98> onerous = difficult
[23:25:07] <PenguinMan98> jquery 1.11?
[23:25:11] <PenguinMan98> holy crap
[23:25:20] <PenguinMan98> Why am I using such an old version?
[23:29:06] <sacho_> what version are you using
[23:38:46] <symfonius_> if you call hide() on something that is already hidden, are there any side effects?
[23:41:21] <sacho_> not generally
[23:53:44] <PenguinMan98> OK. the problem doesn't reproduce in jsfillde
[23:53:48] <PenguinMan98> jsfiddle
[23:54:27] <PenguinMan98> http://jsfiddle.net/kykw5fvz/
