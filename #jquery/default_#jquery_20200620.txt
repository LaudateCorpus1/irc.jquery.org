[11:19:36] <GrandMoffTarkin> hi, I a js file flagged in Google Page Speed for unused code, the file only has this code and when I look under coverage in chrome it shows this, should it be written some other way to not get flagged? https://i.imgur.com/8rfN7dZ.png
[11:20:05] <GrandMoffTarkin> s/I a/I have a/
[11:25:19] <Waldkauz> Do those elements even exist on the page? That can be the only reason this code is never executed
[11:27:05] <GrandMoffTarkin> Waldkauz:  yes, it is on all pages, it controls the nav and a footer popup, its definitely used
[11:27:31] <GrandMoffTarkin> im guessing its something about the way it is written which is what I was trying to see if you guys knew right away
[11:31:37] <Waldkauz> Well, it's weird that you would even flag this kind of pattern unless you're absolutely sure about the semantics of the function taking the function argument
[11:34:07] <GrandMoffTarkin> looks pretty standard, I didn't write it, but ie if you look at the first, its basically a click on the mobile hamburger link to add a class to show a menu
[11:37:24] <Waldkauz> Yes, that's what I mean. If you flag this pattern, you have to make sure that no such elements occur on the page, because adding a handler is the effect of $().click
[11:38:43] <saradt> Hi humanoids! Is there a way to make a listener on a class, which works both on existing, but also future added elements? So I don't have to add the listener everywhere that adds new elements of that type.
[11:39:15] <GrandMoffTarkin> Waldkauz:  yeah im scratching my head
[11:46:34] <Waldkauz> GrandMoffTarkin: This post indicates it might have to do with code being in the "wrong" place, i.e. Google perhaps wants to encourage you to split or move your code  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62065117/remove-unused-code-google-page-speed-and-others-errors
[11:47:46] <GrandMoffTarkin> saradt:  you can add the class using a higher level selector that exists like body for instance, so if you class was say, .item then instead of $('.item') you would do $('body .item') as a simple example or $('#some_other_selecter_id .item') etc
[11:48:50] <saradt> GrandMoffTarkin - And if I do $(..).click(func.... before the element exist, on the above class, it will work when new children are added?
[11:49:01] <GrandMoffTarkin> yes
[11:49:03] <saradt> sorry on a parent objec to it.
[11:49:25] <saradt> That's a very nice approach, then I could really define my click listeners at the start.
[11:49:54] <saradt> As I already know pretty specific where they will be inserted! Awesome, I'll try that. Thanks GrandMoffTarkin <3
[11:51:03] <GrandMoffTarkin> saradt:  body is generally safe and I used it for the example, but if you have a wrapper container that is closer to the elements that might be more efficient to use
[11:51:19] <saradt> Yeah I figured, and I do :)
[11:51:21] <GrandMoffTarkin> it could be any selector
[11:52:00] <Waldkauz> Hhm, are you sure this works? I think you need a delegated event handler instead
[11:53:56] <GrandMoffTarkin> Waldkauz:  I don't think I have had a problem with it, saradt if it doesn't work for you try $(document).on('body','.item', function() {
[11:54:49] <GrandMoffTarkin> Waldkauz:  yeah I have been going thru those docs since about 12 hours now but haven't found what I need to change
[11:55:17] <GrandMoffTarkin> Waldkauz:  is my last suggestion to saradt more inline with what you were saying ?
[11:56:07] <GrandMoffTarkin> saradt:  https://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:56:47] <Waldkauz> GrandMoffTarkin: Yeah, this is what I had in mind
[11:57:13] <GrandMoffTarkin> saradt: sorry was too obsorved in what I was doing, ignore my first recommendation of $('body .item') just noticed that was wrong
[11:57:30] <saradt> Roger that :)  Will check out using delegates.
[11:57:57] <GrandMoffTarkin> I had the latter in mind but somehow ended up typing that, happens when you are staring at the same thing for hours
[11:58:09] <GrandMoffTarkin> thanks for the correction Waldkauz
[11:58:27] <saradt> No harm done :)
[12:03:50] <GrandMoffTarkin> guess im going to have to go to the source to find the answers I am looking for, literally
[15:49:35] <isin> hello
[15:50:36] <isin> есть живые?)
[15:59:30] <isin> интересно, этот чат юзает сокет.ио?
[16:25:29] <ckb> Hi guys! When I call .html() is there some kind of delay? If I execute code manually through console, it works as intended after .html is called, but even with .promise().done(fn) I'm still not getting desired results.
[16:40:29] <Waldkauz> .html() is called immediately/synchronously
[17:02:22] <robertmaxrees> ckb show us more code - sounds like maybe there's something else going on.
[17:06:11] <ckb> robertmaxrees: it's a bootstrap issue :( it's ok
[17:06:22] <robertmaxrees> Oh!  Fair enough :)
[17:06:51] <ckb> if you're still willing to help me troubleshoot this, then I would be grateful
[17:06:57] <robertmaxrees> SUre!
[17:07:08] <ckb> Move over to #bootstrap or PMs?
[17:07:22] <robertmaxrees> just in the channel is fine.
[17:07:49] <robertmaxrees> *in this channel, rather.
[17:08:32] <ckb> Well okay, so it seems like injected HTML and trying to call bootstrapSwitch() on inserted checkboxes doesn't give desired results.
[17:08:53] <robertmaxrees> can you show the code in a jsfiddle?
[17:10:14] <ckb> I'm really not familiar with jsfiddle... does it have jquery by default?
[17:10:29] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with any code pasting sites?
[17:10:37] <robertmaxrees> that allows you to run things
[17:10:58] <ckb> yes of course I am. I've used jsfiddle for testing other people's code, but not familiar setting up use cases.
[17:11:55] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/0G4vbUt.png so you use taht dropdown on the "Javascript" pane to select jquery.  on left left, there's a "resources" group - that's where you add the deps for bootstrap.
[17:12:50] <robertmaxrees> or you might see this banner when you hit the site, which includes a button for a bootstrap boilerplace - https://i.imgur.com/r7vUPQ9.png
[17:14:59] <ckb> not sure how to add bootstrap CSS/JS to this
[17:15:10] <ckb> Ahh resources
[17:16:05] <robertmaxrees> ;) it's like i'm a few steps ahead already.
[17:17:07] <ckb> do I need a full HTML document? or just simple elements ok? (<html>...</html> etc
[17:17:22] <robertmaxrees> literally just the bits to replicate the problem.
[17:17:25] <robertmaxrees> not a whole page.
[17:17:34] <robertmaxrees> assume you have the full page already - so just the widgets or w/e
[17:25:42] <ckb> Well looks like I can't even get the external library to work
[17:26:13] <ckb> Does jsfiddle support scss?
[17:27:02] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/rL8cg4A.png ;)
[17:27:18] <robertmaxrees> can at least get your code in and we can try to get it going then?
[17:27:39] <ckb> for resources?
[17:27:43] <ckb> https://jsfiddle.net/7oc146yb/
[17:27:45] <robertmaxrees> just your specific code.
[17:28:15] <ckb> I can't get the bootstrap switch to display
[17:28:30] <robertmaxrees> well yeah - your markup is broken for starters :)
[17:28:56] <robertmaxrees> and your JS has an extra parenthesis
[17:29:22] <ckb> I forgot a quote, my appologies
[17:29:22] <robertmaxrees> also: bootstrapSwitch  looks like a separate plugin from bootstrap itself - need to include that, too.
[17:29:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/856rvc27/1/ for the html and js fixes.,
[17:30:37] <ckb> https://jsfiddle.net/7oc146yb/1/
[17:31:05] <ckb> however, I'm pretty sure I can't add scss into resources
[17:31:13] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah you need to use css.
[17:31:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/48tzg9ew/
[17:31:32] <ckb> one moment
[17:31:34] <robertmaxrees> this is what you're looking for :)
[17:31:54] <ckb> HOW DO YOU DO THAT SO FAST
[17:32:01] <ckb> okay one second
[17:32:05] <robertmaxrees> :) been doing this for a while.
[17:32:14] <robertmaxrees> also: you have the name attribute on that input twice.
[17:33:34] <ckb> bare with me here... one second
[17:35:33] <ckb> https://jsfiddle.net/mL6wnhp7/5/
[17:35:42] <ckb> okay SO this doesn't work for me on my app :(
[17:36:04] <robertmaxrees> but it does in the fiddle?
[17:36:09] <ckb> I'm also using handlebars that generates the HTML
[17:36:18] <ckb> but I don't see that causing problems
[17:36:42] <robertmaxrees> for starters, just to simplify things, you don't need that .each() - you can just do $("input[data-bootstrap-switch]").bootstrapSwitch();
[17:37:25] <ckb> sigh ok well something else is going on
[17:37:31] <robertmaxrees> second, if it works fine in the fiddle, not sure what to tell ya.  are you getting any console errors when on your side?
[17:38:00] <ckb> one sec
[17:38:17] <ckb> https://jsfiddle.net/mL6wnhp7/7/
[17:38:20] <ckb> Notice the "checked"
[17:38:31] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:38:45] <robertmaxrees> What about it?
[17:38:49] <ckb> I missed something critical one second
[17:39:53] <ckb> Okay something else is going on and I'm not sure
[17:40:12] <robertmaxrees> never answered my question btw
[17:41:31] <ckb> https://jsfiddle.net/mL6wnhp7/13/
[17:41:41] <ckb> No console errors
[17:42:00] <robertmaxrees> so is this showing the bug??
[17:42:19] <ckb> that's the code excerpt I'm having issues with
[17:42:34] <ckb> I can't reproduce it in jsf :(
[17:42:43] <robertmaxrees> sounds like the issue isn't this code then.
[17:43:21] <ckb> I can log the checked prop and it's true before I run bootstrapSwitch(...)
[17:43:38] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the specific bug you're having?
[17:43:44] <ckb> without the timeout, the switch gets displayed but wrong value
[17:44:25] <ckb> I don't know.. Thanks for trying to help.
[17:44:28] <robertmaxrees> what is user_template?
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> mind showing that code?
[17:45:47] <ckb> There's PHP code in it
[17:45:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:46:05] <robertmaxrees> can you show just the javascript part?
[17:46:13] <ckb> One second
[17:46:13] <robertmaxrees> or are you dynamically generating JS using PHP?
[17:47:19] <ckb> I'll show you... one moment
[17:48:18] <ckb> https://jsfiddle.net/mL6wnhp7/15/
[17:49:00] <ckb> it's the engine EmberJS/GlimmerJS uses for templating
[17:50:06] <robertmaxrees> gotcha - so this is taking the template in-page then prepping it for use later.
[17:50:32] <ckb> yes, you can precompile the template in production for super quick and responsive remplating
[17:50:42] <ckb> so user_template returns raw HTML
[17:50:44] <robertmaxrees> yea, reading the docs now.
[17:51:37] <ckb> you know...
[17:52:26] <ckb> it might have SOMETHING to do with .edit being tied to bootstrap Modals
[17:52:56] <robertmaxrees> i would doubt that.
[17:53:03] <robertmaxrees> that's all synchronous.
[17:53:07] <ckb> but without the interval, it STILL will display the switch
[17:53:17] <robertmaxrees> what's the "json" var all about?
[17:53:31] <ckb> just userdata
[17:53:35] <robertmaxrees> got an example?
[17:53:39] <ckb> eh
[17:53:39] <robertmaxrees> trying to get the fiddle working.
[17:53:44] <ckb> one second
[17:53:55] <robertmaxrees> you can fake it with "foo" and "bar" and stuff.
[17:54:23] <ckb> I have to redact a lot
[17:54:28] <robertmaxrees> lol 1 sec.
[17:54:28] <ckb> just one second
[17:54:37] <robertmaxrees> let me show you what you need :)
[17:55:48] <ckb> how can I export json to notation in console?
[17:55:50] <ckb> possible?
[17:55:54] <robertmaxrees> JSON.stringify
[17:55:56] <robertmaxrees> but no need.
[17:55:59] <robertmaxrees> i figured it out.
[17:56:27] <ckb> oh?
[17:56:37] <robertmaxrees> just needed to stub it out :)  i'll show you.
[17:56:47] <ckb> I appreciate it so much
[17:57:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7gc9kerx/6/
[17:57:14] <robertmaxrees> something like this?
[17:57:18] <robertmaxrees> though that still works fine.
[17:57:37] <ckb> yes. :(
[17:57:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, dunno then.  https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7gc9kerx/8/
[17:57:50] <ckb> not using a modal for the edit button
[17:58:01] <robertmaxrees> can try adding the modal, but that's likely not going to make a difference.
[17:58:12] <ckb> that's what I was talking about
[17:58:31] <ckb> now the Interval will display the correct value
[17:58:49] <robertmaxrees> timeouts fixing things usually means you've got an async operation happening somewhere.
[17:59:16] <ckb> but if you look at the comment
[17:59:49] <ckb> In my fiddle, it's literally .html() -> .bootstrapSwitch()
[18:00:19] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  without seeing it broken, I'm gonna have to assume it's either an async issue, or you have an error happening somewhere.
[18:01:50] <ckb> Now the other thing
[18:02:03] <ckb> The post data isn't being send with the form call
[18:02:15] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:02:17] <ckb> s/send/sent
[18:02:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the relevant code for that.
[18:03:34] <ckb> Just kind of over it. It's going to be easier for me to just use seperate pages
[18:03:52] <robertmaxrees> uh.  ok heh.
[18:03:55] <ckb> I appreciate your help
[18:03:57] <ckb> so much
[18:04:19] <ckb> I don't know how to test a form with jsfiddle
[18:04:27] <robertmaxrees> you mean an ajax call?
[18:04:43] <robertmaxrees> or just general forms?
[18:04:45] <ckb> well if you notice the toggle doesn't toggle the checked value
[18:05:04] <robertmaxrees> let me go back to a previous test case.
[18:06:02] <robertmaxrees> so what, you toggle the input and the "checked" property doesnt' change?
[18:06:24] <robertmaxrees> like, how are you seeing that it doesn't work the way you expect?
[18:06:24] <ckb> right using that 3rd party
[18:06:39] <ckb> well, inspect the toggle switch
[18:06:46] <robertmaxrees> so in the dev tools?
[18:07:05] <ckb> yes, toggle the switch and watch the input not change
[18:07:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:07:11] <robertmaxrees> that's expected.
[18:07:18] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you.
[18:07:52] <ckb> I wish this was personal code and I could just give you access :(
[18:08:04] <robertmaxrees> i don't heh
[18:08:09] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't be able to afford it ;)
[18:08:17] <ckb> ahhhhh
[18:08:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/afu2qwvg/3/
[18:09:02] <robertmaxrees> so this is a common misconception about checkboxes.
[18:09:15] <robertmaxrees> actually about most form inputs.
[18:09:20] <ckb> it's crazy, because postdata includes the "permission" it's just completely empty
[18:09:40] <robertmaxrees> the element attribute never changes, nor does the element in the inspector, but the underlying DOM node DOES change.
[18:09:42] <ckb> no matter if a toggle is on/off
[18:09:49] <robertmaxrees> you care about element properties, not attributes.
[18:10:10] <ckb> how to check?
[18:10:20] <robertmaxrees> did you look at the fiddle I just shared?
[18:11:16] <ckb> I'm getting nothing in console
[18:11:35] <robertmaxrees> are you filtering things out?
[18:11:51] <ckb> console.log should show? I use it all the time
[18:12:03] <ckb> OH
[18:12:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:13:28] <ckb> Okay so I'm fine with the interval but I can't figure out why it won't send the post data... let me try something
[18:13:39] <robertmaxrees> you need to fix the interval thing.
[18:13:49] <ckb> >:(
[18:14:00] <robertmaxrees> the more issues you're describing, the more convinced I am that they're all related.
[18:14:16] <ckb> prop checked is true on the input
[18:14:51] <ckb> oh wait
[18:15:04] <robertmaxrees> where's your form tag btw?
[18:15:10] <robertmaxrees> and submit button?
[18:15:29] <ckb> .... I'm sanitizing the data
[18:15:47] <ckb> It's just the interval issue I need
[18:15:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:16:10] <robertmaxrees> you mean the checkbox isn't going through due to sanitizing the data?
[18:16:43] <ckb> yes. I looked over me sanitizing data.
[18:16:53] <ckb> JUST the interval is what I'm worried about right now
[18:17:23] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so are there any ajax calls or anything at play here?
[18:17:27] <ckb> the form is the modal wrapper
[18:17:32] <ckb> no ajax on this app at all
[18:17:49] <robertmaxrees> then let's take a kick at the modal.
[18:18:06] <ckb> I can show you all the JS that's being loaded on the page
[18:18:16] <ckb> (that I have written)
[18:18:24] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:18:48] <robertmaxrees> I get why you're offering that, but what that means is "I can show you all this code for you to dig through without context".
[18:19:05] <ckb> It's not much more than what I've shown you
[18:19:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:19:21] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:19:46] <ckb> disabling autocomplete on focus, then an empty user model for a createUser that uses that form
[18:20:05] <ckb> and a handlebars directive for {{#ifCond}}{{/ifCond}} in the template
[18:20:35] <ckb> could the autocomplete thing be causing it?
[18:20:51] <robertmaxrees> I highly doubt it.
[18:20:58] <ckb> Nope
[18:21:04] <robertmaxrees> so back up.
[18:21:23] <robertmaxrees> i think you're getting lost in the weeds here - the idea is to slowly add in features until the bug shows up.
[18:22:31] <robertmaxrees> that's how we make test cases.
[18:24:31] <ckb> just getting frustrated. no ajax is going on. let me check network real quick
[18:24:48] <robertmaxrees> maybe add the modal portion and we can see if there's something there?
[18:25:04] <ckb> to the fiddle?
[18:25:08] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:27:54] <ckb> https://jsfiddle.net/rpnfh0yq/2/
[18:28:07] <ckb> Not quite sure the modal isn't displaying?
[18:28:40] <ckb> ah hold on
[18:29:39] <ckb> https://jsfiddle.net/rpnfh0yq/4/
[18:30:09] <robertmaxrees> problem still isn't there though hah.
[18:30:29] <ckb> but it is
[18:30:36] <robertmaxrees> ah, there we go.
[18:30:40] <ckb> name="permissions[p123124]" checked
[18:30:43] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so let's see what's up.
[18:31:01] <ckb> I need to run to the bathroom.... been staring this beast down for 4 hours now
[18:38:48] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/javascript/ - "
[18:39:07] <robertmaxrees> "All programmatic API methods are asynchronous and returns to the caller once the transition is started but before it ends."  this is your core issue.
[18:40:17] <ckb> Okay
[18:40:33] <robertmaxrees> so my first question - why are you waiting to do this on click?
[18:40:41] <ckb> so is it better to call set innerHTML on the javascript object?
[18:40:49] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[18:41:06] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a jquery html/native innerhtml thing.
[18:41:18] <robertmaxrees> so why are you waiting to do this until the button to add an input is clicked?
[18:41:45] <ckb> on click displays the modal, generates the HTML, and inserts the HTML
[18:41:56] <robertmaxrees> ol
[18:41:58] <robertmaxrees> *lol
[18:42:06] <ckb> "edit a user"
[18:42:08] <robertmaxrees> why generate the html and insert it on click?
[18:42:19] <robertmaxrees> aaaah gotcha.
[18:42:22] <ckb> table full of users with an edit button
[18:42:51] <ckb> hence the json variable with all the data
[18:42:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:43:19] <ckb> rather than generating x amount of forms for x users...
[18:43:37] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:43:44] <ckb> I tried .html().promise.done(...)
[18:43:48] <robertmaxrees> again.
[18:43:58] <robertmaxrees> html is synchronous, so doing that won't change anything.
[18:44:01] <robertmaxrees> also: the issue isn't jquery.
[18:44:12] <robertmaxrees> it's that bootstrao treats things like showing modals as async events.
[18:44:27] <ckb> I misunderstood here
[18:44:48] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:45:09] <ckb> My question is... why does $("#modal .modal-body").html() work in this case?
[18:45:26] <robertmaxrees> because it does?
[18:45:34] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean why does that work but your plugin doesn't?
[18:45:40] <ckb> correct
[18:46:23] <robertmaxrees> then ask that ;) and it's convoluted.  last i looked, the way bootstrap manages modals involves cloning markup and some other weird jank.  so the modal that gets displayed isn't a 1:1 representation of what it actually copied from./
[18:46:31] <ckb> would the best solution be to have the entire content there and modify input values THEN call the plugin?
[18:47:10] <robertmaxrees> that might be one option.  i would also research to see how to get bootstrap to respect what's in there already.
[18:48:06] <ckb> it's just happenstance that .html() runs right after bootstrap creats the modal?
[18:48:14] <robertmaxrees> that's nopt what i said :)
[18:49:07] <ckb> This is a bit complex for me
[18:49:14] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:49:51] <ckb> I don't understand how the HTML can be there, the plugin notices the attribute, but doesn't apply it.
[18:50:06] <robertmaxrees> last i checked, bootstrap basically clones the modal before moving it and displaying it to the user.  that clone might not be picking up all properties/attributes set on elements.  so the html is good to go, but it might be having issues with the bootstrap switch plugin.
[18:50:17] <robertmaxrees> it's just a quirk of working with the dom.
[18:50:40] <robertmaxrees> the plugin is getting initialized, but its state isn't getting properly retained after that cloning operation.
[18:50:43] <robertmaxrees> that's a total guess though.
[18:51:06] <ckb> Gotcha
[18:52:11] <ckb> But if you get rid of the plugin on click, the input displayed reflects the correct value.
[18:52:15] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet the plugin you're using is maintaining state in an unusual way, causing the headache you're seeing here.
[18:52:25] <robertmaxrees> correct, because the issue is the plguin specifcally.
[18:52:33] <ckb> understood.
[18:52:46] <robertmaxrees> how many users are there per page here?
[18:52:57] <ckb> the one I'm specifically working on? 3
[18:53:24] <robertmaxrees> i mean under normal circumstances, how many will be on the page?
[18:54:11] <ckb> what this all stemmed from is me creating a "sub accounts" feature for my app, and give them certain permissions.
[18:54:20] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[18:54:26] <ckb> so I would say no more than 5? but I don't know?
[18:54:31] <robertmaxrees> let me clarify:
[18:55:04] <robertmaxrees> if you're talking about a handful of users (which should be the case - pagination and search/filtering are rad :)), then I might just forgo this dynamic version entirely.
[18:56:05] <ckb> I'm not quite sure how search/filters/pagination would help here? unless we're talking about pulling this form out and putting it on an entirely new page load
[18:56:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that if you're not going to be displaying more than a few to the user, there's really no benefit to dynamically building out the contents from the modal.
[18:56:47] <robertmaxrees> and instead you can just have the modals ready to go right on the page.
[18:57:55] <ckb> I do have the super admin area that I might want to convert this all over to with maybe 250 users
[18:58:09] <ckb> parent accounts / sub accounts information
[18:58:34] <ckb> (search is already there, pagination not)
[18:58:43] <robertmaxrees> I would implement pagination for those cases then.
[18:59:04] <robertmaxrees> though that solution may/may not fix this case.
[18:59:14] <robertmaxrees> have you searched to see if anybody else has had this issue?
[18:59:30] <ckb> that's why I'm here :(
[18:59:35] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:59:45] <ckb> because I searched for atleast 30 minutes
[18:59:49] <robertmaxrees> (when I ask questions, i'm genuinely looking for an answer, not an obtuse response)
[18:59:54] <robertmaxrees> so has anybody else had the same issue?
[19:00:00] <robertmaxrees> if so, what fixes could you find, if any?
[19:00:11] <ckb> couldn't find anything except someone talking about .live() lol
[19:00:21] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[19:00:32] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/Bttstrp/bootstrap-switch/issues/95
[19:00:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:00:56] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/Bttstrp/bootstrap-switch/issues/95#issuecomment-62135326 this looks like a good candidate.
[19:01:18] <ckb> :O
[19:01:35] <ckb> wait a second.
[19:01:52] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, it might be good to find another similar widget.
[19:03:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, looking at this code I can see a few minior issues that point to this not playing nicely with modals like this.
[19:03:52] <ckb> it works perfectly tbh
[19:03:57] <ckb> but there's a delay
[19:04:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's waiting until the modal fires the "shown" event.
[19:04:17] <robertmaxrees> so once that animation is done, it'll show.
[19:04:24] <ckb> I just applied it all modals, and it will work.
[19:04:29] <ckb> just not like 100%
[19:04:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i think this plugin might just not be the best.  looks like is hasn't even been touched in over a year.
[19:05:41] <ckb> okay, well I really appreciate your help understanding this, because I couldn't wrap my head around it one bit
[19:05:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:05:51] <robertmaxrees> s'what we're here for.
[19:06:18] <ckb> always been here. THANK YOU
[19:07:08] <ckb> sorry to bother you on your Saturday afternoon
[19:07:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:08:06] <robertmaxrees> if I didn't want to help, I wouldn't be here ;)
[19:11:42] <ckb> Do you have any other suggestions for a "switch"? Build my own?
[19:12:19] <robertmaxrees> I haven't used Bootstrap in years so no clue.  I'd search Google and see what else it out there.
[19:12:39] <robertmaxrees> though tbh i avoid those kinds of controls as much as possible.
[19:12:46] <ckb> I feel like I'm way too deep in the mud, and next provision to the UI, I might when I get more help
[19:13:04] <ckb> a lot of our clients are 55+
[19:13:17] <robertmaxrees> OK?
[19:13:20] <ckb> just REALLY easy for them to understand
[19:13:28] <ckb> unless you have an alternative?
[19:13:30] <robertmaxrees> Sure - checkboxes are pretty universally understood.
[19:13:50] <ckb> just like a large checkbox?
[19:14:01] <robertmaxrees> Sure - make the default one bigger.
[19:14:08] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to re-invent that language.
[19:14:37] <ckb> okay, I'm going to go relax a bit. Thank you so much Robert.
[19:14:45] <robertmaxrees> Def!  Good luck :)
