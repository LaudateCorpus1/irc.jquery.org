[00:09:07] <lemonsparrow> like the way they say it is done
[00:11:26] <Eviltwin> Oh good, everything didn't go to shit
[00:38:48] <coldhead> RandalSchwartz: your git intro video is amazing, i'll be showing people this in class and taking it easy for the 2 hours duration <3
[00:41:23] <tw2113> what about this coldhead ? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4PFDKIc2fs
[00:44:20] <coldhead> hmm, topical
[01:33:23] <silv3r_m00n> if i include jquery at the bottom of the page, but in the middle somewhere there is some jquery code like $(function() { .....});   then what happens ?
[01:36:44] <tw2113> try it and see
[01:37:38] <Eviltwin> silv3r_m00n: You're going to have a bad time
[01:38:43] <tw2113> *assumes the nuclear threat position*
[03:13:30] <JuniorJS> hi
[03:15:10] <JuniorJS> I've used localstorage to save items entered into an input field. These items are displayed in another window on the same machine. How do I force an update (note full reload) of the other window?
[03:16:47] <JuniorJS> I don't want to use PHP or something else on the server side
[03:17:32] <FortuneDays> I actually did exactly that a very very very long time ago for ... something to do with my CMS
[03:17:47] <FortuneDays> oh, a lot of it was based off of that actually
[03:17:52] <FortuneDays> for configuring modules
[03:17:57] <JuniorJS> FortuneDays: hmm how did you solve it?
[03:18:11] <FortuneDays> I can't remember. I'm going through my emails now because I remember boasting about it.
[03:18:34] <FortuneDays> And -nothing- server-side? because it would be pretty easy in node, though I entirely agree with your hesitation
[03:19:21] <FortuneDays> And it's a separate window entirely? Not an iframe?
[03:19:28] <JuniorJS> FortuneDays: yes
[03:19:30] <FortuneDays> I'm sure an iframe could- oh
[03:19:57] <JuniorJS> FortuneDays: sure, but I'ts another window. I've used this already during a concert once more or less successfully.
[03:20:53] <JuniorJS> JuniorJS: Meta Refresh or browser plugins taht refresh the window are ugly.
[03:21:07] <JuniorJS> eh.. writing to myself. hahahaha
[03:21:14] * JuniorJS needs coffee
[03:21:19] <FortuneDays> heh
[03:21:21] <FortuneDays> 4:30 am here, too
[03:21:25] <FortuneDays> figuring out some design things
[03:21:32] <FortuneDays> There's a plugin that does what you need, but that isn't the best way to do it
[03:21:52] <FortuneDays> I wish I could remember how I did that; I set it up for dragging and dropping elements across windows for legacy browsers that didn't support the HTML5 draggable api
[03:22:01] <JuniorJS> FortuneDays: I know how I can do that with a server, but I'm looking for a way to do it without a server running php or something
[03:22:07] <FortuneDays> I don't have access to the indev source atm, either :(
[03:22:17] <FortuneDays> http://www.sfpeter.com/2008/03/communication-between-browser-windows-with-jquery-my-new-plugin/
[03:22:20] <FortuneDays> maybe take a look at this?
[03:22:42] <FortuneDays> oh no, huh
[03:22:46] <FortuneDays> this one also does child windows and what
[03:23:39] <JuniorJS> JuniorJS: because the guys at concert only know sound/light tech. And we've tried doing that with a virtual machine, it's working, but totally unreliable due to the unreliable network connections they have at concert
[03:24:22] <FortuneDays> between two different systems' windows?
[03:24:27] <FortuneDays> I'm confused as to the solution you're trying to get
[03:25:42] <JuniorJS> FortuneDays: no, it's on one machine only. One control window and many receiver windows display with beamers and large flatscreens
[03:25:52] <coldhead> .g postmessage
[03:25:52] <b-ot> coldhead: window.postMessage - Web API reference | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.postMessage
[03:26:03] <coldhead> JuniorJS: that will let you talk between windows
[03:26:12] <coldhead> not sure if works in ie
[03:26:47] <JuniorJS> coldhead: :) I've teached them to use Firefox, because they can't install Chrome without Internet access.
[03:27:21] <JuniorJS> Maybe WebRTC/WebSockets can do that, but I don't know
[03:27:34] <coldhead> postMessage works in Fx fine
[03:28:14] <JuniorJS> coldhead: this requires the target window to be created by the parent window, right?
[03:34:46] <JuniorJS> coldhead: that only works with "window.open" or frames or iframes. Is there a way to send a message to a window on an other machine? Maybe with WebRTC/WebSockets or something?
[03:37:13] <coldhead> oh i didn't realise it was for a remote machine
[03:39:56] <coldhead> JuniorJS: this seems to mention some options for the kind of thing you're after http://blog.printf.net/articles/2013/05/17/webrtc-without-a-signaling-server/
[03:40:14] <coldhead> i've never tried sockety stuff peer to peer
[03:40:43] <JuniorJS> coldhead: crazy, how such a simple use-case requires the use of the very latest technologies..
[03:41:03] <coldhead> ah but it's not so simple
[03:41:08] <coldhead> web is client servery
[03:41:11] <coldhead> and you just want all clients
[03:41:37] <coldhead> the simplest fix is to use a server
[03:41:53] <JuniorJS> yeah, I basically need client2client communication without a server.
[03:42:08] <coldhead> you can't make one of the clients a server?
[03:42:32] <coldhead> the one with the source data?
[03:44:01] <JuniorJS> coldhead: The network is unreliable there, it's really used during concerts. (there is one machine they use to control effect and some other they use to control sound/light)
[03:45:46] <JuniorJS> it's just that they enter data in window A for window B;C;D;E;F;etc and want to display updates when pushing a button on window A for B or C etc.
[03:46:10] <JuniorJS> one sender multiple receivers.
[03:46:50] <JuniorJS> or multiple senders and multiple receivers, depending on the event. If there is a lot of data to enter then two people will enter it instead of one
[03:51:56] <coldhead> i don't get it
[03:52:07] <coldhead> if the network is unreliable then that will affect p2p as well as client server stuff
[03:55:18] <JuniorJS> coldhead: oh.. that's true.. argh.. well then they have to rely on one pc and I guess the open.window approach would suffice
[03:56:17] <JuniorJS> Internet access can't be count ont, but altough network access is available, one show has proven that it's not reliable enough for this.
[03:57:53] <iaj> How can I move a div inside a certain div?  Like move .foo inside of .bar?
[03:58:03] <JuniorJS> coldhead: there is something like this on the receiver.. http://image-upload.de/image/9Dvo9K/2d462c87c8.png
[04:01:43] <coldhead> JuniorJS: i did something like that for a festival but it was sponsored by a phone company so they made sure the network worked
[04:02:01] <coldhead> then we just had clients on the big screens and they polled the server
[04:02:13] <coldhead> it was simple and it worked
[04:03:21] <JuniorJS> coldhead: yeah it's similar here, the last show we had two people sitting on the control station and worked with a easy to run appliance, but the network went down during the show, luckily I made a version that also worked without a server.. puhh
[04:04:04] <coldhead> well good luck with that, sorry i couldn't be more help
[04:04:10] <coldhead> i'm from a broken home
[04:04:49] <gordian> $('home').fix();   ??
[04:04:51] <JuniorJS> coldhead: you've been of help already. Thank you for being there!  & FortuneDays too
[04:20:24] <Danny^^P> Hi! I'm using a jQuery UI Accordion. Is it possible to assign custom css classes instead of the default ones?
[04:21:46] <nbw> Hey all. Here is a rather basic question but I could not figure it out over the past two hours.. Hope you can help me. I have a function that fills and array in random order, but than I have to read items from this array in other function.. for the live of me I can't figure out how to make the array content global. Here is my JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/YcWnb/
[04:26:00] <iaj> Is there some easy way to move the div .foo inside the div .bar? Sorry.
[04:28:30] <someone235> Hey, there's a way to "append" event handlers? for example, something like this: http://pastebin.com/8UJWY8CN that will show me two alerts: 123, 456
[05:07:59] <sammich> okay, I'm not sure if I'm missing something really obvious here, but in jQM, I'm trying to bind events to the radio 'buttons' (vertically stacked radio) but it seems the default handlers only listen to the 'click' event.
[05:09:09] <sammich> <a> tags (such as buttons) have vclick, tap and click on them, but my poor radio rows don't have any non-click event listeners. which is a pity since of the 300ms delay on mobile
[05:10:11] <sammich> so, question is, can I give the radio 'rows' the listener for 'vclick/tap' and have it delagate to jQuery for handling
[05:11:05] <sammich> I'd really just love to use 'tap' for every element
[05:11:21] <sammich> which I think is just a fastclick implementation
[05:21:28] <hirsty> Hey all trying to do a focusout on a div to toggler it but it doesnt seem to be working :(
[05:22:10] <hirsty> Basically making a popout form using a tab and when they want to hide it, just move their mouse from it
[05:25:18] <hirsty> vm got it
[05:40:45] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, I have a jquery script to change some css in a hover() function.  I'd like to do this for multiple divs which all have an id #buyButton .  Problem is, only the first button is being changed upon hovering and I'm assuming that it's because the script only works on a div with a unique id.  Does this mean I have to change every single button I have and have a separate script for them all? Is the
[05:40:45] <CocoStorm> re a more efficient way of doing this?
[05:41:17] <sammich> #id only returns the first element
[05:41:22] <hirsty> you can do this with just CSS if your just changing coloours
[05:41:25] <sammich> you can do [id=yourid]
[05:42:03] <hirsty> using #youridhere:hover
[05:43:07] <CocoStorm> sammich, well actually i'm adding a whole class each time it's hovering
[05:43:12] <CocoStorm> hmm but i'll try
[05:43:27] <CocoStorm> hirsty, ^
[05:43:41] <sammich> you'll find that all of jQuery UI applies classes on hover, instead of using css:hover
[05:43:57] <sammich> I'd prefer using CSS, since it's easier to inspect
[05:44:10] <hirsty> Coco u got a jstoggle version?
[05:44:33] <hirsty> @CocoStorm
[05:48:04] <CocoStorm> hirsty, makig one now
[05:48:10] <hirsty> k
[05:54:02] <LennyLinux> Hello
[05:54:15] <newtothis> should i use $('#someid').html('...') to write something inside a span or is the document.getEelemntById('someid').innerHTML='...' portable?
[05:54:54] <LennyLinux> I can't find the source code of $.fn.data function, could you help me, please??
[05:54:55] <sammich> pretty sure jQuery is written to be portable
[05:55:12] <dominicwatson> I've been told I need to test a registration form on a siteâ€¦ I've got Grunt and grunt-contrib-jasmine installed but think these are for unit-testing "headless" as in not an actual DOM browser test?
[05:55:51] <CocoStorm> hirsty, http://jsfiddle.net/wj46X/
[05:56:02] <CocoStorm> sammich, ^^
[05:56:18] <dominicwatson> I'm rather confused about it all at the momentâ€¦ how should I be testing that sayâ€¦ a registration process works and how would this work inside a build process?
[05:56:31] <hirsty> so what you wanting it to do in addition?
[05:56:36] <newtothis> (ti's mentioned here, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.innerHTML but no details about portability)
[05:56:46] <hirsty> @ CocoStorm
[05:57:09] <hirsty> o nvm
[05:57:19] <CocoStorm> hirsty, nothing, I just want all the buttons to .shine on hover
[05:58:11] <newtothis> sammich, yes i'm wondering about doing this kind of thing without jquery - i'm try to lighten up some stuff :) (not for any real need, it's fast enough just out of curiosity)
[05:58:47] <sammich> CocoStorm: use css :hover
[05:58:50] <LennyLinux> newtothis: on MDN you have all the infor you need
[05:59:41] <CocoStorm> sammich, I've tried but it doesn't give the same effect
[05:59:43] <hirsty> @CocoStorm so you would use: #buyButton:hover{ class details here }
[05:59:51] <CocoStorm> i did that hirsty
[05:59:53] <CocoStorm> wait
[06:00:02] <sammich> I think you have different values for the colours
[06:01:26] <sammich> css doesn't change the markup either, not that I think it has a big impact either way
[06:02:02] <CocoStorm> sammich, http://jsfiddle.net/wj46X/2/
[06:02:09] <CocoStorm> hirsty, ^^
[06:02:51] <CocoStorm> it just goes a bit mental
[06:02:52] <CocoStorm> lol
[06:03:35] <hirsty> where your shine2 class?
[06:03:58] <LennyLinux> I can't find the source code of the $.fn.data function, could you help me, please?? Where can i find it?
[06:04:00] <hirsty> nvm got it
[06:05:03] <hirsty> height: 00px;
[06:05:09] <hirsty> thats why lol
[06:05:13] <sammich> the hover rule adds to the css of the non:hover
[06:05:19] <sammich> so you don't need to redefine it all
[06:05:53] <sammich> just the stuff you want to change on :hover
[06:06:07] <sammich> it has a higher precedence for the non :hover css rules
[06:06:21] <sammich> higher than*
[06:06:49] <CocoStorm> ahh i see
[06:07:00] <CocoStorm> i've added a height of 20px and it still does the same http://jsfiddle.net/wj46X/4/
[06:07:06] <hirsty> @CocoStorm rather trying to add a gradient
[06:07:30] <sammich> you have two definitions for height
[06:07:34] <hirsty> because with that class you are assigning a background
[06:07:47] <hirsty> which is white
[06:08:20] <CocoStorm> hirsty, but it worked before
[06:08:31] <sammich> hah, it is white
[06:08:38] <hirsty> yes you were adding additional classes
[06:08:48] <sammich> that gradient you copied might be better suited to a non-white background
[06:09:46] <sammich> start simple: comment /* out */ all your gradient stuff, and just put in something obvious, like red
[06:09:54] <hirsty> http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ - try this to get the right gradinet then add that to buyButton:hover
[06:09:56] <CocoStorm> oh I thought you said :hover adds to a class
[06:09:57] <sammich> background-color: red
[06:10:21] <hirsty> no it replaces
[06:10:48] <sammich> crap, sorry. It replaces as it has a higher precedence
[06:11:04] <hirsty> as with the jquery method your adding some white with a full alpha for the rest of it
[06:11:18] <sammich> #button { background-color:black } #button:hover { background-color:red; }
[06:11:58] <CocoStorm> hirsty, a full alpha?
[06:11:59] <sammich> you can have as many rules in the #button ruleset, but only what you want changing in :hover
[06:12:03] <CocoStorm> also i've done it http://jsfiddle.net/wj46X/5/
[06:12:09] <hirsty> alkpha = transparency
[06:12:12] <CocoStorm> ah
[06:12:16] <sammich> opacity
[06:12:21] <hirsty> same thing :P
[06:12:50] <CocoStorm> so with the jquery i'm adding to the class, whereas with css it replaces it?
[06:12:54] <sammich> yeah but you can't set opacity: 1 can you :o
[06:12:55] <sammich> :p
[06:13:09] * hirsty shrugs
[06:13:10] <sammich> then again, the a in rgba is alpha, so...
[06:13:52] <sammich> why are you changing the height in :hover
[06:14:00] <sammich> and the width...
[06:14:27] <CocoStorm> sammich, cos when it was height:00px width:50px the button was smaller
[06:14:29] <CocoStorm> when i hovered over it
[06:14:50] <sammich> remember, only whatever you want changing in :hover
[06:14:56] <CocoStorm> try it
[06:15:04] <CocoStorm> I'm not sure what that is
[06:15:05] <CocoStorm> :S
[06:15:31] <sammich> don't think I'm seeing it
[06:15:32] <CocoStorm> *why
[06:16:26] <CocoStorm> sammich, http://jsfiddle.net/wj46X/6/
[06:17:18] <sammich> just get rid of the width/height
[06:17:20] <sammich> in the hover
[06:18:01] <CocoStorm> sammich, oh yeh lol
[06:18:04] <CocoStorm> thanks
[06:18:08] <CocoStorm> thanks hirsty too
[06:18:14] <sammich> only stuff that changes
[06:18:14] <hirsty> np ;)
[06:18:21] <sammich> yw
[06:18:30] * hirsty kicks Wordpress Â¬.Â¬
[06:18:35] <sammich> there's one more thing though
[06:18:38] <CocoStorm> and for the onclick, it's juts :visited?
[06:18:54] <CocoStorm> yeah?
[06:18:55] <sammich> that, or ':active'
[06:19:08] <sammich> iirc, I haven't done heaps on that
[06:19:23] <hirsty> its :active
[06:19:28] <sammich> :visited is only for clickthroughs
[06:19:30] <hirsty> :visited is for hyperlinks
[06:20:03] <CocoStorm> ah
[06:20:26] <sammich> in your first document.ready(), if you want to unset $el.css, just set it to a blank string
[06:20:45] <sammich> because you're currently setting it to the wrong colour
[06:20:56] <sammich> and that colour has the higest precedenence
[06:21:19] <CocoStorm> sammich, ahh in the mousedown function?
[06:21:20] <sammich> inline styles are pretty high
[06:21:26] <sammich> yeah
[06:21:43] <sammich> so make that #000 in the mouseup to be ''
[06:21:58] <CocoStorm> sammich, awesome, thanks
[06:23:43] <sammich> glad to help
[06:26:17] <sammich> unconventional use of hide()
[07:22:39] <platinoid> I am looking to implement something like a pop up box on clicking a list that has all the list elements with an option to edit remove that option. This involves mysql delete queries. can someone point me in the right direction
[07:24:22] <platinoid> hello?
[07:28:59] <fission6> maybe google 'select2'
[07:29:01] <fission6> could help
[07:29:37] <fission6> are you prototyping something plastinoid
[07:34:01] <jax> how do i get all inputs of $(form) ?
[07:34:17] <fission6> do you want the values
[07:34:27] <fission6> i.e. - what do you want to do with the inputs?
[07:34:46] <jax> call a function on them
[07:34:53] <jax> .tooltip('disable')
[07:35:47] <fission6> $('form :input')
[07:36:00] <fission6> thought how do you enable the tool tip
[07:36:16] <fission6> maybe you want to consider your selector
[07:38:15] <motaka2> using http://pastebin.com/y3DBusFT i get all forms inputs, but among checkboxes I just need checked check boxes. what should I do ?
[07:38:54] <fission6> ':checked' maybe
[07:40:04] <jax> can i check if an input has focus currently?
[07:40:42] <jax> found it
[07:42:37] <jax> and how do i find the first input which has a certain class set?
[07:43:35] <motaka2> fission6: no it does not work
[07:47:55] <motaka2> using http://pastebin.com/y3DBusFT i get all forms inputs, but among checkboxes I just need checked check boxes. what should I do ?
[07:49:21] <platinoid> fission6:not prototyping, actually building. So say I have some tasks for the day, a list basically. when I click on edit buttin it displays a pop up where I can edit or delete these
[07:49:35] <fission6> ok
[07:49:42] <fission6> well get your web services in place
[07:49:52] <fission6> then built a simple ui to hit the web services
[07:49:59] <fission6> then do ajax for calling ghtem
[07:50:02] <fission6> i sense your working backwards
[07:50:48] <jax> $(form).find("div[class=error]").filter(":first") should find the first div in the form with class="error" right?
[07:51:45] <fission6> $('form div.error:first')
[07:51:48] <fission6> something like that could work
[07:52:49] <platinoid> fission6:I will look into that, thanks
[07:54:33] <motaka2> platinoid: using http://pastebin.com/y3DBusFT i get all forms inputs, but among checkboxes I just need checked check boxes. what should I do ?
[07:55:55] <jax> and how can i get the first input inside $('div.error:first', form) ?
[07:56:19] <jax> just hook another find on there ?
[07:58:12] <motaka2> why no one answers my question ?
[08:01:26] <SinnerNyx> motaka2, can you explain the $form.find(':input') line to me?
[08:02:04] <SinnerNyx> shouldn't it be $form.find('input'), motaka2
[08:02:06] <SinnerNyx> ?
[08:02:47] <motaka2> SinnerNyx: Well the first one simply works
[08:03:09] <SinnerNyx> motaka2: I don't think it should. Makes me wonder what HTML you're running this against
[08:03:40] <SinnerNyx> motaka2: nevermind I just found it
[08:03:43] <SinnerNyx> interesting
[08:04:29] <SinnerNyx> ok, well if you want JUST the checkboxes, you can do inputs.filter('[type=checkbox]')
[08:05:09] <SinnerNyx> Sorry, you want just the checked checkboxes, then you can do inputs.filter(':checked')
[08:06:27] <SinnerNyx> motaka2: Let me know if that doesn't work for you.
[08:07:40] <SinnerNyx> motaka2: note that the :checked selector will also show radio buttons and select elements. If you want JUST checkboxes you'll need to do inputs.filter('[type=checkbox]:checked')
[08:13:53] <motaka2> SinnerNyx: No thats not what I want, what I want is to have all input values but among check boxes I just need checked ones
[08:14:46] <SinnerNyx> motaka2, ok I gotcha now try this then:
[08:16:04] <SinnerNyx> inputs.not('input[type=checkbox]').add($form.find('input[type=checkbox]:checked'))
[08:18:07] <SinnerNyx> or
[08:18:55] <SinnerNyx> inputs.not('input[type=checkbox]:not(:checked)')
[08:19:44] <motaka2> SinnerNyx: What is that ? I have $form not inputs
[08:20:38] <SinnerNyx> motaka2: var inputs = $form.find(':input');
[08:20:42] <SinnerNyx> you create an inputs
[08:20:47] <SinnerNyx> I'm just further filtering that
[08:22:28] <SinnerNyx> if you want you can replace that with: var inputs = $form.find(':checked(:not(input[type=checkbox]:checked))')
[08:22:31] <SinnerNyx> I think..
[08:22:41] <SinnerNyx> just not very readable
[08:22:49] <SinnerNyx> ugh, screwed it up
[08:22:58] <SinnerNyx> if you want you can replace that with: var inputs = $form.find(':checked:not(input[type=checkbox]:checked)')
[08:23:06] <SinnerNyx> I think that's right
[08:23:39] <banisterfiend> why is it that keyup can detect keys that keydown does not?
[08:23:40] <banisterfiend> such as backspace
[08:23:44] <banisterfiend> seems really weird and inconsistent
[08:23:47] <banisterfiend> but is there a reason for it?
[08:24:38] <SinnerNyx> banisterfiend: I think that's a per-browser thing. Some browsers associate the "backspace" key with the browser back button. So it gets blocked on the script I think.
[08:24:53] <banisterfiend> SinnerNyx: but surely jquery should wrap that all in a reasonable way?
[08:24:57] <banisterfiend> oh
[08:27:15] <banisterfiend> SinnerNyx: how can i do a keydown-like event that detects backspace?
[08:29:31] <SinnerNyx> actually a random google search seems to indicate that keydown should grab it
[08:29:44] <SinnerNyx> banisterfiend: can you create a jsfiddle of your case?
[08:46:35] <banisterfiend> SinnerNyx: hmm, u're right
[08:46:45] <banisterfiend> SinnerNyx: seems the 'ace' editor is stopping propagation
[08:47:31] <SinnerNyx> banisterfiend: I'm not sure about this 'ace' editor thing. is that a WYSIWYG control for webpages or something?
[08:47:47] <banisterfiend> SinnerNyx: it's an editor
[08:47:56] <banisterfiend> SinnerNyx: i mean pure javascript editor
[08:48:00] <banisterfiend> it's a jquery plugin
[08:48:08] <banisterfiend> SinnerNyx: ace.ajax.org
[08:48:10] <SinnerNyx> banisterfiend: I see.
[08:48:29] <SinnerNyx> banisterfiend: I've needed something like that before. I'll look into it soon. Thanks :)

[09:13:59] <JuniorJS> Hi
[09:15:16] <JuniorJS> I want to set the value of a textarea to the content of localstorage, but somehow it displays it wrong. http://jsbin.com/asuxow/1/edit
[09:16:02] <JuniorJS> I'm getting ["Lorem","Ipsum","Dolor"] instead of Lorem\nIpsum\nDolor
[09:16:18] <JuniorJS> each on it's own line
[09:17:37] <JuniorJS> oh and when I use $('#area') instead of  document.getElementById("area") I get an error..
[09:21:57] <iaj> jquerylers.. Is there some easy way to move a div inside another div with jQuery?
[09:24:54] <JuniorJS> iaj: $("#source").appendTo("#destination");
[09:25:28] <JuniorJS> iaj: there is also prependTo()
[09:26:01] <shoky> JuniorJS: http://jsbin.com/asuxow/2/edit
[09:26:41] <shoky> JuniorJS: no need for that Array.prototype thing http://jsbin.com/asuxow/3/edit
[09:27:30] <JuniorJS> shoky: and how about converting this to jquery? I mean textarea for example causes an error
[09:27:31] <shoky> JuniorJS: and of course you get an error when using $('#area')  .. you're not including jquery
[09:27:40] <JuniorJS> shoky: you've just read my mind :)
[09:28:18] <shoky> JuniorJS: http://jsbin.com/asuxow/4/edit
[09:36:26] <JuniorJS> shoky: hmm.. that appears to work perfectly!  I'm still bugging around with my code. That was a minimal example.
[09:37:26] <Norbo11> http://pastie.org/8049157
[09:37:33] <Norbo11> is this correct usage of Ajax in Jquery?
[09:37:37] <Norbo11> It doesn't seem to be working
[09:38:03] <Norbo11> http://pastie.org/8049160
[09:38:07] <Norbo11> this is my logout.php file
[09:40:23] <JuniorJS> Norbo11: how is that supposed to work? use session_destroy();
[09:40:35] <shoky> Norbo11: the jquery looks fine. i donno php much.. but don't you need to close that <?php
[09:40:56] <shoky> Norbo11: check your browser's devtools network-tab and look at the actual response
[09:41:14] <shoky> also add an error handler to the $.ajax call
[09:41:34] <JuniorJS> shoky: nope, php is weird, you don't need to close it.
[09:42:02] <shoky> weird indeed
[09:42:33] <JuniorJS> Norbo11: honestly, don't write authentification stuff yourself. Use a framework's library instead. Otherwise you will definately make errors that **** up your security.
[09:43:23] <JuniorJS> I've seen so many sites been blown away by hackers, it's cheese easy to hack sites using php... so many of them don't care or ignore security. makes one sad :(
[09:43:52] <vsync_> so rather use a library that doesn't care / ignores security! win!
[09:44:05] <vsync_> why not write you rown, that cares / does not ignore...
[09:44:43] <Norbo11> shoky, you don't need a ?> at the end of a file
[09:44:56] <vsync_> Norbo11: you still probably want a page refresh after a logout...
[09:44:59] <vsync_> so why ajax?
[09:45:04] <Norbo11> in fact, you shouldn't have one, as putting a space at the end of a ?> at the end of a file causes errors
[09:45:21] <JuniorJS> vsync_: you negate what I say, but I guess you know abuot taht. Norbo11 here's a slim framework, which is easy to use. http://fatfreeframework.com/home
[09:46:07] <vsync_> JuniorJS: but your assumption is that, everyone who writes their own authentication stuff are a bunch of clueless f*cks
[09:46:18] <vsync_> assumption, or more like generalization
[09:46:34] <Norbo11> thanks for that JuniorJS but I'm only playing about a little bit for now, i'm new to web development
[09:47:01] <vsync_> okay JuniorJS point taken afterall
[09:47:13] <vsync_> *lol*
[09:47:14] <Norbo11> i'll be trying out CodeIgniter soon
[09:47:26] <Norbo11> but thanks vsync_, you're right.. I shouldn't be using ajax
[09:47:27] <Norbo11> derp
[09:47:42] <JuniorJS> Norbo11: CI is nice.
[09:48:10] <JuniorJS> vsync_: that's rude, I wouldn't say it like that. But it's very true that a lot of php developers don't have a clue about security, it's not that easy after all.
[09:49:02] <Norbo11> I'll keep secutiry as a priority when developing an actual web application that I care about
[09:49:13] <Norbo11> for now I'm just trying to replicate a sort of facebook for gamers ;)
[09:49:28] <vsync_> Nothing is 'hard' per se, it's about gathering information
[09:50:35] <banisterfiend> is there a nicer way of referring to 13 (enter key press) in jquery?
[09:50:44] <banisterfiend> or i just have to test for e.which == 13
[09:50:49] <banisterfiend> is there anything like ENTER_KEY built in?
[09:51:28] <shoky> banisterfiend: don't think there's anything built in
[09:52:53] <shoky> banisterfiend: there's built-in constants in jquery-ui if you're including that
[09:53:06] <shoky> $.ui.keyCode.ENTER
[09:53:14] <banisterfiend> thx
[09:57:22] <JuniorJS> shoky: The console spits out Lorem\nIpsum\nDolor but the textarea contains only "Dolor". Here's the current code http://jsbin.com/asuxow/5/edit
[09:58:22] <JuniorJS> shoky: I'm sorry I don't know howto create the same localstorage array in the jsbin demo as I have localy. Maybe it would help when you could show how to display the entire content of "todo-orders"
[10:01:24] <JuniorJS> shoky: ah ok I got it, chrome shows the content of localstorage. I have "todo-counter" =3; "todo-orders"="todo-1,todo-2,todo-3" but the most interesting part is todo-1="Lorem" todo-2="Ipsum" and todo-3="Dolor"
[10:02:29] <boytoy> Trying to implement this awesome bezier easing plugin https://github.com/rdallasgray/bez -- how come it won't work though? http://jsfiddle.net/HquWH/
[10:04:30] <jedimind> boytoy: that plugin hasnt been touched in 2 years
[10:04:37] <jedimind> i would expect it doesnt work with latest jquery
[10:05:00] <shoky> JuniorJS: http://jsbin.com/asuxow/6/edit
[10:05:06] <boytoy> oh yeah ur right
[10:05:12] * ThomasWaldmann is thinking about whether using jquery mobile for MoinMoin Wiki (2.0) is a good idea.
[10:05:40] <shoky> JuniorJS: you kept overwriting the previous value
[10:06:08] <JuniorJS> shoky: wow that's brilliant! I'll try that out, hah feeling stupid now.
[10:06:11] <JuniorJS> :)
[10:06:39] <boytoy> https://raw.github.com/rdallasgray/bez/master/src/jquery.bez.js is only 4 months old but same thing there
[10:07:19] <JuniorJS> shoky: wohooo it works! :)
[10:07:31] <JuniorJS> shoky: how did you learn javascript?
[10:07:46] * ThomasWaldmann was also looking at bootstrap (license incompatible) and gumby (looks rather simplish, maybe less users/devs)
[10:08:04] <JuniorJS> ThomasWaldmann: checkout zurb's foundation
[10:08:17] <EwokFartPorn> JuniorJS: He learned it carefully.
[10:08:19] <EwokFartPorn> jk
[10:08:25] <shoky> JuniorJS: heh.. reading, and playing around with stuff until i got it
[10:08:39] <ThomasWaldmann> JuniorJS: yeaj, looked at that also. somehow i am undecided a bit. :D
[10:09:08] <JuniorJS> nahh no way,.. been doing the same, well admitedly I just learned jquery a little without knowing javascript
[10:09:17] <vsync_> OMG!
[10:09:21] <shoky> ?learn
[10:09:23] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[10:09:26] <vsync_> ewok fart porn =D
[10:09:31] <vsync_> best nick ever omg ilu<3
[10:09:35] <JuniorJS> ^^
[10:09:41] <ThomasWaldmann> can someone point me to a rather complex desktop web site / web app made with jquery-mobile?
[10:09:41] <EwokFartPorn> vsync_: Why thank you.
[10:10:08] <JuniorJS> vsync_: thanks for the links.
[10:10:24] <JuniorJS> it's time to learn thouroughly
[10:10:26] <shoky> JuniorJS: and i learned a ton just being here and helping out people
[10:11:03] <EwokFartPorn> Yup, learning enough to help out people is the way to go.
[10:11:04] <JuniorJS> shoky: thanks by the way. that really helped me.
[10:11:11] <shoky> np
[10:11:27] <JuniorJS> are you freelancing?
[10:11:50] <shoky> a bit, but mostly a regular 'office' job
[10:12:33] <JuniorJS> wow, thought that's impossible.. gotta be fun projects then only right? Or is your main job not paying well?
[10:13:10] <boytoy> Ok update: Trying to implement this awesome bezier easing plugin https://github.com/jaukia/easie -- how come it won't work though? http://jsfiddle.net/HquWH/1/
[10:13:14] <shoky> what's impossible?
[10:13:22] <JuniorJS> main job + freelancing
[10:13:51] <EwokFartPorn> I'm sure many people in here do it.
[10:14:13] <shoky> welp i can't say my main job pays great, i stay there cause other than the pay it's really nice conditions for me
[10:14:16] <EwokFartPorn> It looks like the job pays enough for him/her to have an internet connection and help people.
[10:14:46] <shoky> and yea the freelance stuff i've done was mostly fun ;]
[10:28:35] <JuniorJS> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/HquWH/3/ hmm idk if it works.
[10:29:47] <boytoy> JuniorJS: ah like that
[10:29:47] <JuniorJS> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/HquWH/4/ little cleaner
[10:30:03] <boytoy> it works very well indeed thanks a lot
[10:32:25] <JuniorJS> http://jsbin.com/ is better than jsfiddle.com
[10:32:28] <EwokFartPorn> http://jsfiddle.net/HquWH/5/
[10:32:31] <boytoy> yeah i think so too
[10:32:39] <EwokFartPorn> Does jsfiddle have an error checker?
[10:33:07] <JuniorJS> nope, afaik
[10:33:18] <EwokFartPorn> I don't think so either.
[10:33:23] <EwokFartPorn> Curious though.
[10:33:26] <JuniorJS> there is only jshint
[10:33:34] <EwokFartPorn> jsbin has one.
[10:33:43] <EwokFartPorn> Which is more helpful.
[10:43:01] <boytoy> JuniorJS: do i really have to specify animate though? shouldnt slideUp suffice? http://jsfiddle.net/HquWH/6/
[10:43:26] <JuniorJS> boytoy: idk, haven't looked through the source of the plugins
[10:43:54] <boytoy> ah ok cool
[10:44:53] <JuniorJS> boytoy: maybe this is better though http://jsbin.com/onavaq/1/edit
[10:46:45] <boytoy> JuniorJS: a bit beyond my level i think :D
[10:50:35] <boytoy> JuniorJS: gonna run wit this http://jsfiddle.net/HquWH/7/ THANK YOU
[10:51:15] <JuniorJS> boytoy: nice, now it works. I'm an amateur too :)
[10:51:17] <gnarf> boytoy: { duration: ..., easing: $.easie } should work
[10:51:39] <boytoy> gnarf: oh for real?
[10:52:22] <gnarf> the easie examples use the crappy easy to not know wtf is going on argument order :)
[10:52:36] <gnarf> $.fn.animate(props, opts) is always easiest
[10:52:43] <boytoy> gnarf: ooh weeeeee =)
[10:53:04] <cuhevox> Hi! How would I do this with regex pure javascript? $('a[href^="mailto:"]') - not work document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="mailto:"]')
[10:53:20] <boytoy> gnarf: much better like this, thank you as well
[10:53:47] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/HquWH/8/
[10:54:46] <gnarf> cuhevox: qsa should work with attribute starts with

[11:28:52] <motaka2> using http://pastebin.com/y3DBusFT i get all forms inputs, but among checkboxes I just need checked check boxes. what should I do ?
[11:29:09] <motaka2> I am trying to get help for more than 10hrs
[11:31:31] <Ebonwumon> How can I call a callback function whenever a change occurs to the html of a div?
[11:31:42] <Ebonwumon> .change() doesn't look like the event I want.
[11:39:04] <motaka2> Ebonwumon: using http://pastebin.com/y3DBusFT i get all forms inputs, but among checkboxes I just need checked check boxes. what should I do ?
[11:39:16] <BlueShark> Hi, I'm trying to check the status code of a URL and display it if it's 200 with `if (data.header.match(/200/))`, but it doesn't work. Demo: http://techswipe.com/foo/ What am I doing wrong?
[11:40:41] <Ebonwumon> motaka2, use a more creative selector. "$form.find('input[type=checkbox]:checked')"
[11:40:55] <Ebonwumon> Double check that "checkbox" is the right type name, I can't remember.
[11:41:09] <Ebonwumon> But that should return you inputs of the type checkbox that are checked
[11:45:12] <Kirito_kun> I have a question about jqueryui 1.10.3 (in conjuction with jquery 2.0.2). I am trying to do an animation between the hide(slide effect) and the show(slide effect) of the next tab. Using beforeActivate it will run my animation before the old content is hidden. and using activate does the animation after the new tab is already shown
[11:47:12] <Kirito_kun> So I wondered how I will be able to put my own animation between those 2 effects
[11:48:39] <motaka2> why no one cares about my problem ?
[11:50:52] <Ebonwumon> motaka2, not only is that incredibly entitled of you, but I also answered your question already
[11:51:05] <Ebonwumon> <Ebonwumon> motaka2, use a more creative selector. "$form.find('input[type=checkbox]:checked')"
[11:51:05] <Ebonwumon> <Ebonwumon> Double check that "checkbox" is the right type name, I can't remember.
[11:51:05] <Ebonwumon> <Ebonwumon> But that should return you inputs of the type checkbox that are checked
[11:52:40] <shoky> Ebonwumon: as to your question.. you can't.. not in a nice cross-browser way
[11:53:50] <Ebonwumon> yeah shoky I kind of got that impression after googling. I made a different solution by binding a 'mychange' event to my div and then whenever I change the html I .trigger('mychange')
[11:54:00] <Ebonwumon> Not as elegant as what I wanted, but it's functional.
[11:55:15] <shoky> ya if you have control over what's changing the html, that's a fine solution
[11:56:01] <Ebonwumon> That's the problem. I'm fearful that I'll always have control over the change, but I guess I can just refactor later down the road if it becomes a problem.
[11:56:01] <shoky> also more elegant, imo
[11:59:05] <motaka2> shoky: using http://pastebin.com/y3DBusFT i get all forms inputs, but among checkboxes I just need checked check boxes. what should I do ?
[11:59:42] <shoky> motaka2: didn't Ebonwumon answer your q ?
[11:59:50] <shoky> twice
[11:59:51] <motaka2> I cant find it
[12:00:19] <shoky> <Ebonwumon> motaka2, use a more creative selector. "$form.find('input[type=checkbox]:checked')"
[12:00:38] <motaka2> shoky: Ebonwumon I really couldnt see that
[12:01:12] <motaka2> shoky: does that cover text inputs and text areas ?
[12:01:33] <shoky> motaka2:  does type=checkbox seem like it would?
[12:02:18] <alaing> text input, use .val() or simple use this.value. text areas you need to use .text()
[12:02:27] <motaka2> shoky: no, I think no, and my question starts from here, cause I know that filter
[12:02:36] <shoky> alaing: nah, textareas you use .val() or this.value  also
[12:03:02] <alaing> really?
[12:03:28] <alaing> not sure why I thought it was differnet
[12:03:39] <alaing> possible an ie7 this?
[12:03:42] <alaing> this=thing
[12:03:43] <shoky> alaing: probably because of how you set the initial value in HTML
[12:03:58] <alaing> ah, possible
[12:04:28] <shoky> motaka2:  have you seen .serialize() and .serializeArray()  ?
[12:04:38] <motaka2> shoky: no
[12:04:47] <motaka2> is that the answer to my question
[12:04:48] <shoky> motaka2: they do more or less what you're trying to do there
[12:05:23] <motaka2> shoky: can u please give me a link and may please tell me if what I am doing is abnormal ?
[12:05:50] <shoky> motaka2:  but anyway if you wanna filter out unchecked checkboxes the way you did it.. you can do  $form.find(':input:not(:checkbox), :checkbox:checked')  for example
[12:06:36] <shoky> or .find(':input').filter(function() { return !$(this).is(':checkbox') || this.checked })
[12:06:38] <motaka2> shoky: may u please paste somewhere, it changes like avatars on thunderbird
[12:06:39] <alaing> I have a sass query, does anyone here has experience with sass (scss)?
[12:06:49] <shoky> motaka2: time to get a new irc client..?
[12:06:58] <alaing> i know there #sass but the room is pretty dead
[12:07:02] <motaka2> shoky: What do u suggest ?
[12:07:11] <shoky> motaka2:  or if its the joins/quits/etc thats bothering you.. find how to hide them
[12:07:50] <Kirito_kun> I am trying to put a custom animation between the hide and show effects for my tabs. http://jsfiddle.net/WnDV9/123/ (this is the part I have for the sliding). But using beforeActivate triggers before the hide and activate triggers after the show. Is there a possible way to put a animation between those 2 effects in jqueryui 1.10.3 and if so would you be so kind to point me in the right direction?
[12:08:06] <shoky> motaka2: i donno, i use mirc on windows cause i'm used to it. there are prolly better ones
[12:08:35] <Kirito_kun> sorry wrong link http://jsfiddle.net/WnDV9/126/
[12:08:52] <motaka2> shoky: for instance I try your second suggestion I mean this one find(':input').filter(function() { return !$(this).is(':checkbox') || this.checked })
[12:09:54] <motaka2> shoky: Thank you very much , the second one works absolutely perfect
[12:13:42] <motaka2> shoky: I didnt try your first suggestion
[12:14:48] <motaka2> shoky: was it better?
[12:17:31] <shoky> motaka2: nope
[12:18:11] <motaka2> shoky: So I'll try the second one but I comment the first one because it is beautiful
[12:19:26] <shoky> lol
[12:19:48] <shoky> Kirito_kun: i don't think it's possible
[12:21:00] <motaka2> shoky: how can I add tect areas and selects ?
[12:21:22] <shoky> ?:input @ motaka2
[12:21:23] <bot-t> motaka2, :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[12:21:27] <motaka2> shoky: var inputs = $form.find(':input,select,textarea').filter(function() {
[12:21:28] <motaka2>         return !$(this).is(':checkbox') || this.checked;
[12:21:28] <motaka2>     });
[12:21:42] <shoky> motaka2: no need
[12:21:47] <motaka2> shoky: thank you
[12:21:56] <motaka2> shoky: What about radios ?
[12:22:03] <shoky> radios are inputs
[12:22:23] <motaka2> shoky: Whats the best IDE/Editor for js?
[12:22:46] <shoky> motaka2: notepad and chrome devtools
[12:23:07] <motaka2> shoky: I prefer sublime
[12:23:17] <shoky> k ;p
[12:23:26] <Kirito_kun> shoky: hmm was slightly afraid of that. kinda wanted to let content slide out>make the wrapper the size of a tab and slight away behind the tab>let the "new" wrapper slide out from the selected tab and then let the content slide back in
[12:26:06] <sharpy> hey can anybody tell me why i am still getting a cannot call method substring of undefined even with this check???
[12:26:31] <sharpy> http://paste.schredder.me/1413/14107861/
[12:26:35] <sharpy> just dont get it
[12:26:57] <sharpy> i even tried it with a typeof
[12:27:01] <sharpy> but no success
[12:30:41] <shoky> sharpy:  i guess it has no id..
[12:31:01] <sharpy> it is not finding an element
[12:31:04] <sharpy> with that id
[12:31:05] <shoky> sharpy: and that firt line doesnt make any sense without typeof btw.
[12:31:07] <shoky> first
[12:31:39] <sharpy> corrected it
[12:32:03] <sharpy> but still not working
[12:32:05] <shoky> sharpy: make a jsfiddle with html and code if you want more help
[12:46:55] <BlueShark> Hello, I'm trying to display a gif image while retrieving data with getJSON. Here's my code: http://jsfiddle.net/Jqdh4/ I added a `$("#loading").hide();` there, but it doesn't hide the loading.gif image even after the request is finished. What's wrong? Could someone help?
[12:52:59] <dylan9o4> hey guys, why does this simple script not work? http://jsbin.com/udawap/1/edit
[12:54:52] <peepsalot> dylan9o4, probably because google.com doesn't return valid json?
[12:55:55] <dylan9o4> anybody on?
[12:56:24] <dylan9o4> oh, well what can I do to get the html from x-domain peepsalot ?
[12:56:45] <JuniorJS> shoky: I wanted to add a simple typewriter effect like this http://jsfiddle.net/Meligy/jDQnB/ to the code, but I get "TypeError: srcText[i] is undefined" here's what I have http://jsbin.com/asuxow/8/edit
[12:57:38] <peepsalot> dylan9o4, if you don't own the other domain, you'll probably need a server side script that can query it for you and echo it back
[12:57:41] <JuniorJS> shoky: It's weird, but the example works in jsbin. But not in the browser.
[13:01:10] <shoky> JuniorJS: you should use setTimeout repeatedly instead of setInterval.  and clearInterval(this)  is totally wrong
[13:02:18] <shoky> JuniorJS: do you want it to write letter by letter or word by word?
[13:02:35] <JuniorJS> letter by letter
[13:03:20] <dylan9o4> peepsalot: okay, I'll resort to php then
[13:04:58] <jax> i have 2 buttons in a form.. one is "copy address infos" and the other one is a submit button. the problem is, that when you hit enter it fires the first button which is the copy one. how can i get around this?
[13:06:07] <shoky> JuniorJS:  http://jsbin.com/asuxow/9/edit
[13:07:27] <JuniorJS> shoky: crazy how it takes you a minute what takes me an hour
[13:07:33] <jax> fixed it
[13:08:15] <shoky> JuniorJS: well, copying bad code from someone else will hold you back a while :P
[13:09:58] <JuniorJS> shoky: hahaha, yeah. That's how I do, and why I suck at fixing js code. I'll have to read a javascript book until next month. Just got one for beginners
[13:10:16] <velcrow> Can someone please take a look at this code? http://pastebin.com/AXkuD3RD When you hover over login, the div which shows acts oddly. If I remove the "blind" effect, it works fine. Thank you so much!
[13:13:40] <shoky> velcrow: include jquery-ui
[13:15:04] <velcrow> shoky, Wow! I would have never figured that out! Works great!
[13:15:23] <velcrow> shoky, Thanks a lot. Just curious to know why it seemed to semi-work without jquery ui.
[13:20:31] <shoky> velcrow: it was trying to just animate it in with jquery's default show animation (where you put a duration as first argument)
[13:22:14] <shoky> velcrow: and it jumps down like that because its outer width got to be bigger than its container or something, and because of the floating behaviour. dont know the exact details of whats goin on there
[13:23:15] <velcrow> shoky, No problem, thanks anyway. It works beautifully now, and so do my other pages.
[13:23:37] <shoky> sweet
[13:29:46] <adamsilver> How do I say this: add class "abc" to every label that is located under <div class="control-group">
[13:30:05] <imsky> $(".control-group > label").addClass("abc")
[13:31:01] <jedimind> that's assuming the label is the immediate child of .control-group
[13:31:03] <jedimind> fyi
[13:31:21] <iop> y only .control-group label
[13:32:32] <jedimind> what
[13:32:53] <adamsilver> imsky: that worked, thank you
[13:33:12] <jedimind> adamsilver: you can also just use that as a selector with css
[13:33:15] <jedimind> and nto add a class at all
[13:33:17] <jedimind> just fyi
[13:33:34] <jedimind> .control-group label { do whatever .abc was going to do }
[13:33:42] <jedimind> or .control-group > label { } rather
[13:36:04] <adamsilver> jedimind: that's a good idea but .control-label comes from twitter bootstrap framework and I don't want to copy the class content
[13:36:30] <jedimind> it would be less taxing on the client, and you wont get a flicker of styles (waiting for js to apply it)
[13:36:40] <jedimind> you dont have to copy the class content, just append whatever the custom styles are for that label in your own css file
[13:36:53] <jedimind> it'll still apply whatever is default, you just make your adjustments - whatever you would've done with .abc { â€¦ }
[13:37:16] <imsky> yw adamsilver
[13:37:16] <jedimind> keep in mind the style will look that way until js kicks in and adds that class, so you're going to get a flicker of unstyled or wrongly styled conentent
[13:37:21] <jedimind> content*
[13:38:35] <iop> jedimind $('.control-group label').addClass(); i think
[13:38:55] <jedimind> iop: the > means that its an immediate child
[13:39:00] <jedimind> and not just any label inside .control-group
[13:39:04] <jedimind> which is why we suggested that
[13:40:44] <iop> y i know ... sry i thought that he want all of them
[13:41:04] <adamsilver> jedimind: http://bpaste.net/show/f2WN7VCCH63HPXhSFGR4/
[13:41:05] <alaing> I have a sass query, does anyone here has experience with sass (scss)?
[13:41:07] <iop> no only immediate child
[13:41:08] <alaing> i know there #sass but the room is pretty dead
[13:42:01] <adamsilver> jedimind: i don't get it how will i have that added without copying the class content of control-label
[13:42:01] <adamsilver>  to my .control-group > label
[13:42:05] <jedimind> alaing:  youre probably better off in #css
[13:42:31] <jedimind> adamsilver: ah you're adding .control-group to it
[13:42:32] <alaing> jedimind: quiet true ;-P thanks
[13:42:33] <jedimind> which is an alraedy existing class
[13:42:52] <jedimind> i mean, i would still duplicate the css out of .control-group personally into .control-group > label { â€¦ {
[13:42:53] <jedimind> personally
[13:42:58] <jedimind> or if you want, edit the bootstrap css and simply add
[13:43:06] <jedimind> .control-group, .control-group > label { â€¦ }
[13:43:10] <jedimind> so it applies it to both
[13:43:43] <adamsilver> jedimind: ok thanks, i will look into that
[13:44:39] <jedimind> im also being super finicky, it really makes no huge difference
[13:51:37] <malorie> I'm trying to send some data to my server and store it in a file, but I can't seem to get it to work. that's what I have so far: http://ideone.com/AGEfm7
[13:51:57] <malorie> it isn't writing the test string to the file. what am I doing wrong?
[13:52:37] <malorie> also, eventually I'd like to write the contents of the passed object to the file
[13:53:47] <tw2113> you'll need to grab the data from the actual $_POST global that gets sent
[13:54:12] <tw2113> right now all you're doing is creating a variable that you don't even use on the php side
[13:54:19] <tw2113> and then running file_put_contents on 2 strings
[13:56:38] <malorie> I see. I thought the first argument to file_put_contents was the file name
[13:57:24] <tw2113> is that "testfile" a file on the server?
[13:57:58] <tw2113> not jQuery related, but http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-put-contents.php
[13:58:17] <tw2113> checking if it returns false or not?
[13:58:32] <tw2113> and you'll still need to grab the ajax sent data somehow
[13:58:40] <malorie> it's a file, yes
[14:02:35] <malorie> tw2113: I don't know what I should do with the information whether it succeeds or not
[14:02:50] <tw2113> process it
[14:02:57] <tw2113> why are you sending this data to the server?
[14:03:00] <tw2113> to save to a file, right?
[14:03:03] <malorie> yes
[14:03:14] <tw2113> well you need to fetch the data first, before you can write to a file
[14:03:34] <malorie> but right now not even the test case is working :\
[14:04:03] <tw2113> then that's your first step to solve
[14:04:10] <tw2113> and both of these steps are php based instead of jquery
[14:04:17] <tw2113> so you may want to start there
[14:04:23] <malorie> fair enough
[14:22:40] <nastus> could anyone tell me why this wouldnt post? http://jsfiddle.net/X8Gaf/3/
[14:29:42] <nastus> could anyone tell me why this wouldnt post? http://jsfiddle.net/X8Gaf/3/
[14:35:16] <RRR2_> Post where?
[14:36:30] <nastus> it posts to a php file RRR2_ , but i cant add that into the jsfiddle so I didnt include it
[14:36:51] <nastus> but its not even reaching that file, yet anyways because something in the javascript is messing up
[14:37:43] <tw2113> the url to the php file
[14:37:46] <RRR2_> You mean, even if you put the "website" it doesn't reach it?
[14:39:50] <nastus> you know what RRR2_, you made me realize that I didnt include the file I needed to define that... derp thanks lol
[14:40:09] <RRR2_> ...
[14:40:39] <nastus> its always the smallest things in the biggest projects >.>
[14:41:30] <shoky> nastus: that's what the js console is for.. Uncaught ReferenceError: website is not defined
[14:41:41] <nastus> it wasnt popping up
[14:41:46] <nastus> because I checked that lol
[14:41:50] <tw2113> console is my bff with js
[14:41:56] <shoky> then figure out why
[14:42:10] <shoky> you need to see errors ;p
[16:30:57] <skypce> hi all, what is wrong with this code, i want that by each .class element that is hovered trigger a function
[16:30:57] <skypce>     $(".one_five").each(function() {
[16:30:57] <skypce>         $(this).mouseover(function() {
[16:30:57] <skypce>            TweenMax.to($(this), 1,{css:{opacity:1}});
[16:30:57] <skypce>         });
[16:30:58] <skypce>         $(this).mouseout(function () {
[16:31:00] <skypce>             TweenMax.to($(this), 1,{css:{opacity:0.5}});
[16:31:02] <skypce>         });
[16:31:04] <skypce>     });
[16:31:07] <skypce> sory
[16:31:09] <skypce> sorry
[16:31:11] <skypce> http://jsfiddle.net/qqBRe/
[16:37:22] <shoky> skypce: the code is triggering the functions fine
[16:37:52] <skypce> something is wrong, when i hover a div class .one_five nothing appends
[16:38:18] <shoky> skypce: then make a demo showing the problem
[16:38:19] <skypce> shoky
[16:38:25] <skypce> ok
[16:38:27] <skypce> thank you
[16:38:49] <shoky> you don't need the .each  btw
[16:40:50] <skypce> shoky
[16:40:55] <skypce> when i dont use each
[16:41:01] <skypce> the jquery works
[16:41:09] <skypce> but in all elements of class
[16:41:12] <skypce> all at same time
[16:41:25] <shoky> skypce: i dont know what you're doing if i cant see it happen
[16:42:32] <shoky> by not using .each i meant:  $(".one_five").mouseover(...).mouseout(...);
[16:43:57] <Foxhoundz> If anyone is familiar with the Collusion Firefox/Chrome addon, what JS library did they use to make the canvas web
[16:46:35] <skypce> Foxhoundz: try with createjs
[16:46:41] <skypce> createjs use canvas
[16:46:47] <skypce> and vectors
[16:46:47] <shoky> Foxhoundz: if i get what you're referring to.. they're using d3
[16:49:14] <tw2113> mmm d3
[16:49:30] <skypce> shoky
[16:49:33] <skypce> this is correct?
[16:49:33] <skypce>  $(".one_five").mouseover(function() {
[16:49:33] <skypce>            TweenMax.to($(".one_five"), 1,{css:{opacity:1}});
[16:49:33] <skypce>         });
[16:49:41] <tw2113> stop pasting directly into the chat
[16:49:51] <shoky> skypce: i have no idea what TweenMax is or how you're supposed to use it
[16:50:07] <shoky> skypce: but that's how you call mouseover.. sure
[16:50:51] <shoky> skypce:  and i thought you wanted $(this) inside, not $(".one_five")
[16:52:02] <skypce> the code doesnt works
[16:52:05] <skypce> :S
[16:52:15] <skypce> ok thank you anyways shama
[16:52:17] <skypce> shoky:
[16:52:29] <shama> you're welcome
[16:52:38] <shoky> skypce: maybe you're using TweenMax wrong.. for example maybe they don't want a jquery object as first argument, but a dom node
[16:53:07] <skypce> nono tweenmax is right
[16:53:54] <shoky> they want a jquery object as first param?
[16:54:28] <skypce> yes it accept jquery
[16:54:31] <skypce> and direct selectors
[16:58:06] <skypce> shoky
[16:58:08] <skypce> i solved it
[16:58:10] <skypce> thanks
[16:58:11] <skypce> :D
[16:58:31] <shoky> yerp
[17:00:50] <tw2113> derp shoky
[17:01:40] <shoky> shoky the derp
[17:02:30] <shoky> sup tw2113
[17:02:53] <tw2113> drowning my tears and cyncism with honey flavored whiskey and jelly beans
[17:03:15] <shoky> does it really taste like honey
[17:03:33] <tw2113> yeah, there's a very noticable honey taste to it
[17:03:37] <shoky> it's been too long since i've had whiskey
[17:04:16] <tw2113> purposely due to issues with it? or just lazy/poor?
[17:04:43] <shoky> lazy i guess. no special reason
[17:05:03] <tw2113> if you're curious which one: http://cdn2.maxim.com/maxim/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_main/public/BOTD_0321_Barenjager_L1.jpg?itok=L8zTgOks
[17:06:13] <shoky> looky tasty
[17:07:55] <and_j> hey shoky you helped me last day with a chart.. one question.. i need to trigger the graph once i submit my form with ajax so i was wondering if including the projectChart() function in searchFormProjectsRep() is the correct way ?  http://jsfiddle.net/j3sss/
[17:07:57] <shoky> i only enjoy red wine or whiskey when it comes to alcohol
[17:10:55] <shoky> and_j: donno what you mean..
[17:11:08] <and_j> lol hehe
[17:11:49] <shoky> especially what you mean by "include"
[17:12:09] <shoky> you can call the function from inside the success callback.. sure
[17:12:52] <shoky> or from outside the success function if you don't need to wait for it..
[17:13:45] <and_j> shoky:  i was wondering if i need to add projectChart() inside the ajax of searchFormProjectsRep() in order to show it
[17:14:19] <shoky> and_j: you can put "projectChart()" (call the function)  from wherever you want it to be called..
[17:14:55] <and_j> i see
[17:15:22] <and_j> damn this is driving me crazy
[17:16:17] <shoky> give more details or a live link if you got a problem
[17:20:06] <and_j> guess ill have to do a live example
[17:24:15] <RandalSchwartz> Codepen is pretty cool
[17:24:25] <RandalSchwartz> I'm liking it better than jsfiddle, since it's live
[17:24:35] <RandalSchwartz> are there other sites like that?
[17:28:36] <shoky> RandalSchwartz: www.jsbin.com
[17:30:47] <shoky> also tinkerbin.com
[17:30:59] <shoky> prolly a dozen more
[17:43:27] <RandalSchwartz> oooh.  jsbin looks cool
[17:43:46] <Foxhoundz> jsbin is awesome
[17:43:51] <Foxhoundz> much better than JSFiddle imho
[17:44:02] <RandalSchwartz> is it live?  if two people viewing at the same time, does it multi-update?
[17:44:40] <Foxhoundz> open two tabs and find out
[17:44:42] <Foxhoundz> or rather
[17:44:43] <Foxhoundz> browsers
[17:44:48] <Foxhoundz> cookies might get in the way
[17:46:32] <RandalSchwartz> oooh - /watch = follow a Code Casting session
[17:46:39] <RandalSchwartz> so I bet yes, you can watch people edit text
[18:11:18] <Omermuneer> Hi guys
[18:11:36] <Omermuneer> any beginners tutorial you guys can refer?
[18:37:49] <RandalSchwartz> any idea where to find the jquery-ui 1.7 docs?
[18:40:05] <RandalSchwartz> I'm trying to upgrade something from 1.7 to 1.10, but I can't figure out what I was doing calling the 1.7 interface (for tabs)
[18:42:02] <dogCuddler> hi guys ive got a question about my js function
[18:42:17] <dogCuddler> is there anybode who has any idea about it?
[18:42:41] <RandalSchwartz> paste it in jsbin.com, and we might help
[18:46:01] <dogCuddler> there it is   http://jsbin.com/oxaxuw/4/
[18:46:16] <dogCuddler> never used jsbin before, and i dont know how to run it...
[18:46:38] <dogCuddler> and its supposed to be my reduce function in mapreduce algorithm in riak
[18:46:47] <RandalSchwartz> the HTML shouldn't be your JS
[18:47:06] <RandalSchwartz> oh wait...
[18:47:10] <RandalSchwartz> you're not working with jquery?
[18:47:13] <RandalSchwartz> why are you here?
[18:47:31] <dogCuddler> http://jsbin.com/oxaxuw/4/edit
[18:47:53] <dogCuddler> i think its some basic problem for someone who's got an idea about js
[18:48:02] <RandalSchwartz> this is not a general javascript channel
[18:48:09] <dogCuddler> i have to get it done in a short time, and im looking everywhere i can
[18:48:13] <dogCuddler> im desperate
[18:48:20] <RandalSchwartz> and in particular, the stuff about mapreduce in riak isn't related to jquery in any way :)
[18:48:32] <RandalSchwartz> pay someone then
[18:48:35] <dogCuddler> i googled js and this channel popped up
[18:48:48] <RandalSchwartz> yes, because jquery is about javascript manipulation of the DOM
[18:48:55] <RandalSchwartz> not about javascript in general
[18:48:56] <dogCuddler> ok, your enemies will be killed as a payment
[18:49:04] <RandalSchwartz> I have no enemies.
[18:49:18] <dogCuddler> your friends with be rewarded then
[18:49:38] <dogCuddler> please can you take a quick look, to check if there're any basic syntax mistakes?
[18:49:48] <RandalSchwartz> I. do. not. know. riak.
[18:51:04] <dogCuddler> basically, this function takes as a parameter a list of two element lists like so [["a",1],["b",1]]
[18:52:40] <dogCuddler> it should count ocurrences of of every distinctive character, and return the result in the same form as the input param
[18:53:01] * RandalSchwartz shrugs
[18:53:06] <RandalSchwartz> again, you're in the wrong place
[18:53:45] <dogCuddler> i will rape your dog then
[18:53:58] <RandalSchwartz> try /join #javascript
[18:55:48] <dogCuddler> ty ;}
[18:56:14] <NCS_One> hi
[18:56:33] <NCS_One> is there someway of having a timestamp like "2013-06-29 21:00:00.000001+01" and convert it to JS date?
[19:07:19] <RandalSchwartz> maybe Date.parse() ?
[19:08:24] <RandalSchwartz> nope.  just dates. :(
[19:09:32] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - looks like a mess: http://blog.dygraphs.com/2012/03/javascript-and-dates-what-mess.html
[19:11:10] <RandalSchwartz> Oh - it will do times if you're careful
[19:11:55] <RandalSchwartz> nope... I guess not
[19:58:41] <oste> how can I override a function in this plugin https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.fileupload-ui.js
[19:59:13] <oste> that plugin is already extending the main plugin found here https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.fileupload.js
[19:59:29] <oste> just not sure what the proper way is to override the ui plugin
[20:25:25] <laszlo> Hey everybody! I am struggling with a very weird problem, just a few hours before project finish. Would anyone have the time and inclination to help me out?
[20:29:48] <Eviltwin> szucslaszlo4873: Just ask your question, don't ask to ask
[20:32:05] <szucslaszlo4873> Allright, so here it comes: links are loaded with ajax, with different ids. A specific bunch of ids do not pick up any event handlers attached to them, even though they clearly exist in the dom, just before trying to attach event handlers on them. If I write an alert() before attaching the event handlers, everything works fine!
[20:34:05] <szucslaszlo4873> I already tested a hundred times, with .length to check if the selector matches the correct elements, I can print out whatever I want, related to the matched link element with the specific id, but if I try to attach a click event handler on it, it would not work - only if I do an alert() right before the attaching. I am quite confused, as to what's going on.
[20:34:41] <szucslaszlo4873> I am using jquery 1.10
[20:35:30] <RandalSchwartz> no duplicate ids, right? :)
[20:36:04] <szucslaszlo4873> Nay.
[20:36:36] <RandalSchwartz> can you reproduce on jsbin?
[20:37:19] <szucslaszlo4873> I'll try, but I'm not sure if the ajax stuff will work.
[20:40:43] <k_sze[work]> Somehow it appears that ($.browser.msie && window.XDomainRequest) is not necessarily truthy in IE8.
[20:40:48] <k_sze[work]> Can somebody check that for me?
[20:41:50] <snover> you can disable xdomainrequest by group policy
[20:42:40] <k_sze[work]> snover: assuming the default.
[20:42:58] <k_sze[work]> I mean, if I test for $.browser.msie and window.XDomainRequest individually
[20:43:05] <k_sze[work]> the former is 'true', the later is an object
[20:43:42] <snover> this is actually ie8 and not some newer ie in ie8 emulation mode?
[20:43:51] <k_sze[work]> IE8 in Windows XP mode.
[20:44:17] <k_sze[work]> (which is a Windows XP virtual machine running under Windows 7 Pro)
[20:44:44] <snover> canâ€™t say i have seen that happen in ie8
[20:45:24] <k_sze[work]> is `($.browser.msie && window.XDomainRequest) == true` supposed to return `true`?
[20:47:15] <snover> no
[20:47:22] <k_sze[work]> why not?
[20:47:31] <snover> because object is not equal to true
[20:48:06] <k_sze[work]> I thought JavaScript truthiness would coerce it into true, no?
[20:48:27] <snover> no, it coerces it into a string
[20:48:30] <Eviltwin> If you want the boolean, use !!($.browser.msie && window.XDomainRequest)
[20:49:38] <snover> object == true -> object.toString() == 'true'
[20:50:06] <k_sze[work]> I see.
[20:50:21] <snover> itâ€™s actually a little more complicated than that
[20:50:22] <k_sze[work]> but wait
[20:50:34] <snover> but that is the gist of it
[20:50:47] <k_sze[work]> why doesn't the && operator coerce the object into true first?
[20:51:01] <snover> && returns the value, it does not coerce
[20:51:08] <Eviltwin> Because && is so much more useful if it doesn't
[20:52:31] <k_sze[work]> So a more proper test would be ($.browser.msie && !!(window.XDomainRequest)) or ($.browser.msie && typeof window.XDomainRequest === 'object')
[20:53:05] <Eviltwin> You can just do !!($.browser.msie && window.XDomainRequest)
[20:53:23] <snover> why are you explicitly comparing to a boolean anyway?
[20:54:18] <k_sze[work]> I had `if ($.browser.msie && window.XDomainRequest) { /* this */ } else { /* that */ }`
[20:54:26] <k_sze[work]> I was getting 'that' instead of 'this'.
[20:56:31] <k_sze[work]> according to the logic you just described, `if ($.browser.msie && window.XDomainRequest)` should become effectively `if ([object])`, no?
[20:56:42] <k_sze[work]> But then [object] should be truthy, no?
[20:57:00] <Eviltwin> If it's an object
[20:57:20] <Eviltwin> If window.XDomainRequest isn't an object (i.e. is not available) it should be undefined
[20:57:20] <k_sze[work]> typeof window.XDomainRequest tells me it's an object.
[20:57:23] <Eviltwin> Which is falsy
[20:57:31] <snover> why are you even sniffing the browser
[20:57:39] <Eviltwin> Very good question, shoky
[20:57:42] <Eviltwin> Err, snover
[20:57:45] <Eviltwin> Wrong completion
[20:59:17] <Eviltwin> k_sze[work]: It should be unnecessary to do typeof window.XDomainRequest === 'object'
[20:59:26] <Eviltwin> It should be sufficient to do if (window.XDomainRequest) { ... } etc
[20:59:51] <Eviltwin> Assuming you haven't done something stupid like window.XDomainRequest = 12;
[21:00:00] <k_sze[work]> no, of course not.
[21:00:12] <k_sze[work]> I can still use window.XDomainRequest properly in my script.
[21:01:52] <k_sze[work]> So somehow window.XDomainRequest is not immediately available (at least at the time the condition was evaluated when the page was first loaded)!?
[21:02:22] <k_sze[work]> That would be so weird and so wrong.
[22:12:59] <john___> I'm interested in generating nested forms dynamically after an AJAX POST. I haven't had extensive experience working with Jquery or any other AJAX library and i'm a bit stuck, so any hints would be helpful.Code/more info here: http://pastie.org/private/dkop3tgmp3vewzqvoemg .
[22:14:18] <john___> and the promptForm.click() should have been something like promptForm.find(.btn.....), but you get the idea
[22:14:56] <RandalSchwartz> nested forms?  Ick
[22:15:19] <RandalSchwartz> technicaly not allowed
[22:15:50] <RandalSchwartz> see 4.10.3 of the HTML spec
[22:16:44] <john___> RandalSchwartz: I'm unsure how else I would have a series of fields that I can serialize and then associate with some parent object, and then have a visual representation of that to the end user.
[22:16:48] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#the-form-element
[22:17:01] <RandalSchwartz> well - don't nest forms
[22:17:34] <RandalSchwartz> if you have a submit button, you could wire it to submit only a portion of the data
[22:17:39] <RandalSchwartz> but don't put a form inside a form
[22:17:49] <grafi> formception
[22:17:57] <RandalSchwartz> grafi++
[22:18:25] <shmoon> hey guys
[22:18:33] <RandalSchwartz> presuming guys, but ok
[22:18:41] <RandalSchwartz> since most of us probably are. :)
[22:18:45] <grafi> SyntaxError: invalid increment operand
[22:19:05] <RandalSchwartz> should have delcared graif as a var. :)
[22:19:12] <RandalSchwartz> and even grafi
[22:19:16] <grafi> xD
[22:19:52] <RandalSchwartz> I presume anyone posting here is variable :)
[22:19:54] <shmoon> i set data variables on elemens using .data('price', px); - next I do $('.bids') - i want to find elements with a particular `px` - how do I go about doing that
[22:19:57] <shmoon> ?
[22:20:08] <grafi> still you cant increment a string
[22:20:15] <RandalSchwartz> sure I can
[22:20:29] <RandalSchwartz> in perl: $x = "perl"; $x++; print $x # prints "perm"
[22:20:50] <grafi> but this is not #perl
[22:20:50] <grafi> :P
[22:21:04] <shmoon> anyone?
[22:21:12] <RandalSchwartz> but jquery is written by a Perl fan
[22:21:21] <grafi> really?
[22:21:22] <RandalSchwartz> so if there's an .inc method, it'd work that way
[22:21:30] <RandalSchwartz> yes - I interviewed Resig for FLOSS Weekly
[22:21:35] <RandalSchwartz> he said he's a huge Perl user/fan
[22:22:14] <grafi> shmoon loop trough the elements and check the values?
[22:22:19] <grafi> hm perl
[22:22:29] <john___> RandalSchwartz: so make one $(form) object, serialize and POST the fields I do have, and then create a brand new $(form) object with the existing data + additional fields?
[22:22:43] <john___> ad infinitum
[22:23:24] <shmoon> grafi: is that the only way, no jquery inbuilt method to do it ?
[22:23:57] <RandalSchwartz> the built-in ways want to take an entire form, yes
[22:24:54] <grafi> idk, looping through them all and searching 1 by 1 will at least definately work
[22:25:24] <john___> RandalSchwartz: alright I'll try that then. I have no business writing client code right now, but here I am. :)
[22:34:35] <shmoon> no ones alive :/
[22:35:14] <grafi> you're dead shmoon ?
[22:35:18] <grafi> poor you
[22:52:20] <shmoon> super lightweight html5 wysiwyg editor recommendations?
[22:55:46] <Cork> shmoon: contentEditable?
[22:55:51] <grafi> yeah
[22:56:07] <Cork> <div contentEditable="true"></div>
[22:56:16] <Cork> doens't get much more lightweight then that :D
[22:56:52] <grafi> the ultralightweightest
[22:58:07] <Cork> shmoon: though it's not really "html5"
[22:58:27] <Cork> no buzz about an attribute supported for the last 10+ years
[23:00:06] <RandalSchwartz> that's what I say about "recent versions of perl" :)
[23:00:56] <Cork> RandalSchwartz: well "html5" has two options, either it means absolutely nothing, or it means everything you can do in a browser
[23:01:29] <RandalSchwartz> and the answer is "yes"
[23:02:37] <Cork> @keyframe, @font, websocket, <canvas>, transision, transform, h264, webm, weba, webp, javascript jit, svg, svg animations, gpu acceleration, webgl....
[23:02:51] <Cork> so ya, i hate the term "html5"
[23:12:13] <Gazpacho> cork: maybe if you
[23:12:28] <Gazpacho> maybe if you'd read just one HTML spec document you'd hate it less
[23:12:59] <Cork> Gazpacho: the html spec is html, "html5" is just a buzz word
[23:13:33] <Gazpacho> cork: actually no http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/introduction.html#is-this-html5?
[23:13:43] <Gazpacho> it's a buzzword, but not just a buzzword
[23:14:06] <Cork> heh
[23:14:59] <Cork> Gazpacho: the point of the term got lost when eveyone that wanted to promote a new feature they where working on called it html5
[23:15:40] <Cork> and ya, html is a living standard now days, so it doens't have a version
[23:15:52] <Cork> (there of the <!doctype html> doctype)
[23:18:50] <Gazpacho> i admit i did get tired of shitbag recruiters asking me whether i know html5 as if there were no previous specifications
[23:23:05] <zzz123> ?
[23:23:16] <shmoon> i like the wikimedia wysiwyg edito, is it open source anywhere?
