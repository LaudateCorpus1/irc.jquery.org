[00:46:22] <ShadeS> if I type in $('div').first().remove(); into the console it will remove the first div
[00:48:49] <ShadeS> if I have $('.roll').on('click', function(event) { var Index = streams.home.length -1; while(Index >=0) {$('div').first().remove(); Index -= 1; }  NOTHING happens!
[00:52:40] <Uhkis> ShadeS: make a fiddle
[00:57:04] <ShadeS> Uhkis: it won't work there's external libraries that genrate data
[00:57:07] <ShadeS> that aren' going to work
[00:58:06] <Uhkis> just put them there statically
[00:58:56] <ShadeS> i'm not sure how to do this cause data is being generated
[00:59:05] <ShadeS> and stuff is just wonky
[00:59:54] <Uhkis> anyways, your streams.home.length is probably 0 in the start and it never enters the while loop
[01:04:39] <ShadeS> no no, it grows
[01:04:40] <ShadeS> over time
[01:05:58] <Uhkis> are you sure?
[01:07:09] <Uhkis> meaning: have you console.log()'d that index of yours
[01:07:33] <ShadeS> yeah i put in a setTimer(function() { console.log(sterams.home.length); }, 1000); it grows
[01:07:46] <Uhkis> put it in the click handler, that wont help at all
[01:08:34] <Uhkis> also i'm assuming that code isn't the full code since it's missing stuff
[01:13:13] <ShadeS> erm yeah i'm trying a handful of more things before i give up 8 /
[01:13:56] <ShadeS> ok it's kinda sorta doing what i want
[01:13:58] <ShadeS> but not exactly
[01:21:26] <duckxx_> what is the thing called that makes a variable do something as in: jQuery('#blah').val()  ---- what is the val() called? is it called  a function? or a method ?
[01:21:43] <duckxx_> i want to be able to write a conditional to detect if that exists or not.
[01:21:55] <duckxx_> but not sure what thats called.
[01:22:29] <arc_> val() is a method because it works on a jquery object
[01:22:37] <arc_> method is a subset of function
[01:23:01] <duckxx_> ok i have a method called .multiselect()
[01:23:09] <duckxx_> how do i detect if that exists or not
[01:23:29] <duckxx_> do i used isfunction() ?
[01:23:43] <arc_> that should work..
[01:23:53] <ShadeS> i spent too much time on this stuff today
[01:23:56] <ShadeS> i'm going to get some rest
[01:24:24] <Uhkis> have a nice REST! ;)
[01:24:31] <duckxx_> thx
[01:25:12] <Mark____> how do i give delays to jquery addclass?
[01:26:26] <Mark____> is there a way i can give jquery addclass delays one by one?
[01:29:04] <Uhkis> addclass().delay().addclass().delay() not working?
[01:30:31] <Mark____> it’s all the same <tr> im giving addclass to
[01:30:31] <Mark____> jQuery('tr').addClass('animated flipInX');
[01:30:41] <Mark____> how do i make delays in between?
[01:31:20] <Mark____> i thought there can be a genius way to go around this
[01:33:06] <Uhkis> Mark____: https://jsfiddle.net/u0pbnd4w/
[01:40:48] <Mark____> hmm,i’ll take a look at it Uhkis thanks.
[01:58:22] <Mark____> does anyone know the reason why this custom scroll bar won’t be applied on my webpage? http://manos.malihu.gr/repository/custom-scrollbar/demo/examples/scrollbar_themes_demo.html
[03:03:05] <hellyeah> morning
[03:11:45] <rindolf> Hi all . Sup?
[03:11:53] <hellyeah> not much
[03:11:59] <hellyeah> need little bit help
[03:12:31] <rindolf> hellyeah: ah , with what?
[03:14:21] <hellyeah> i am into a problem right now
[03:14:21] <hellyeah> may i ask you may suggest something to me create two datespicker and select the dates you will see below calendar is colorized thats nice so far  then click first pencil button and second pencil button it will remove color  http://jsfiddle.net/rsw4z8tw/6/  but then create two datepicker select the date then click second pencil button and first penc
[03:14:21] <hellyeah> il button  you will see the weirdness.  dont understand why it happened  hmm  actually i understand i guess  but i dont know how to solve it . Problem is in li,ne 87
[03:15:30] <rindolf> hellyeah: I find you hard to understand.
[03:16:05] <hellyeah> okey let me try to simplify it
[03:16:12] <hellyeah> create datespickers two
[03:16:16] <hellyeah> select the dates
[03:16:30] <hellyeah> you will see below calendar is colorized did you see that?
[03:18:57] <hellyeah> then click second pencil button you will see the error
[03:19:30] <rindolf> hellyeah: once I select a date - I cannot select an earlier date.
[03:19:31] <ShadeS> ok so i have this jquery thing <script> $(document).ready(function(){ var $body = $('body'); $body.html(''); ... setInterval(function(){ console.log(streams.home.length) }, 2000); }); </script> thing
[03:19:47] <ShadeS> in my console.log I see a number that grows with each invocation to the setInterval every 2 seconds
[03:20:27] <ShadeS> instead of waiting for setInterval to display when streams.home.length grows, how can I console.log the length of streams.home everytime streams.home grows ??
[03:22:21] <arc_> ShadeS for debugging purposes, you can use this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/watch
[03:22:53] <arc_> if you're using firefox
[03:23:26] <ShadeS> i'm using chrome devs tools
[03:29:59] <arc_> ShadeS then you would have to insert console.log into whatever function is updating that value, after it updates
[03:30:52] <ShadeS> arc_: yeah I don't have access to that file
[03:30:58] <ShadeS> or rather i'm told not to modify that file
[03:31:02] <ShadeS> otherwise that would be kinda easy
[03:31:25] <ShadeS> there's a data_generator.js file that i'm told not to futz with
[03:37:00] <arc_> ShadeS then .. if you know the name of the function that is modifying that value, you can use a callback https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[03:37:44] <ShadeS> what's the deal with event.stopPropagation();
[03:37:52] <arc_> what do you mean
[03:37:59] <ShadeS> when I havea n on('click', do I need this in there?
[03:38:10] <ShadeS> I added something that kinda does what i want
[03:38:15] <ShadeS> but when I did so it broke something else
[03:38:18] <hellyeah> just disable button
[03:38:19] <ShadeS> it broke my onclick thing
[03:38:29] <arc_> no, you don't need it. you only need it if you need it
[03:38:31] <hellyeah> event.StopProgonation doesnt effect click event
[03:38:38] <hellyeah> and even.StopExecution()
[03:38:41] <ShadeS> ok let me bpaste something then
[03:38:48] <arc_> i'm sorry? how doesn't it affect a click event?
[03:38:53] <ShadeS> what's the diff betweewn stopExecution() and stopPropogation?
[03:39:07] <hellyeah> afaik you use both together
[03:39:42] <ShadeS> the tutorial on try.jquery.com didn't really explain it that well
[03:40:08] <arc_> i have never heard of stopExecution. are you sure you're not thinking of preventDefault or something ..
[03:41:13] <ShadeS> https://bpaste.net/show/234412742233
[03:41:31] <ShadeS> yeah preventDefault and stopPropogation
[03:42:29] <hellyeah> ops
[03:42:33] <hellyeah> preventDefault
[03:42:35] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[03:42:45] <hellyeah> but that doesnt effect button
[03:42:55] <arc_> ShadeS most javascript events bubble up. the event will fire on the event target and then on each parent element, but nothing happens if there are no event handlers bound to those parent elements
[03:43:17] <arc_> this is because you may have a span covering part of your div for example, but you want the whole div to accept click events
[03:43:26] <ShadeS> so the above code keeps adding new twats, but the below code is supposed to populate .row.third. with the users timeline
[03:43:26] <arc_> if it didn't bubble up, the span would prevent the div from accepting click events
[03:43:44] <arc_> however sometimes you don't want events to bubble, so stopPropagation prevents that from happening
[03:44:10] <arc_> do you understand
[03:44:18] <ShadeS> erm note sure
[03:44:27] <ShadeS> arc_: can you look at that code to maybe get a better idea of how to word it to me?
[03:46:33] <arc_> the code is kind of irrelevant. if you don't want an event to fire on the event target AND all of the event target's parent elements, then you need to use stopPropagation. otherwise, you do not need to use it.
[03:46:52] <arc_> however, it usually isn't going to break your code
[03:47:08] <ShadeS> but generally I should put i tin?
[03:47:09] <hellyeah> just disable button
[03:47:56] <arc_> ShadeS no, generally you should not put it in. it has a specific purpose and should be used only if you know you need to use it
[03:48:14] <arc_> much like pretty much everything in programming
[03:48:27] <arc_> there's no "best practice that i don't understand but people say it's what to do so i'll do it"
[03:48:40] <arc_> you need to understand what the thing does to use it
[03:48:59] <ShadeS> i don't know what it means for the event to 'bubble up' to the parent node
[03:49:19] <arc_> it simply means that it fires on the event target and the parent elements.
[03:49:27] <arc_> this is because of what i said earlier
[03:49:43] <arc_> say you have a div that is acting as an interactive element. a menu of some kind
[03:49:55] <ShadeS> yes i guess that's what this kinda is
[03:50:04] <ShadeS> when a div is clicked on a behavior happens, that makes it interactive
[03:50:05] <arc_> you want the whole menu item to be interactive so you bind an event handler to the whole menu item
[03:50:35] <arc_> actually that's a bad example
[03:50:46] <ShadeS> in my case it's the $('div') to be interactive . .
[03:51:22] <arc_> i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to come up with an example of when to use stopPropagation right now. it's very situational
[03:51:58] <hellyeah> stopProgonation(); work for button?
[03:52:07] <arc_> yes, why wouldn't it?
[03:52:08] <hellyeah> button is still fired when you use this
[03:52:38] <arc_> it's preventing the event from firing on the parent elements, not the element itself
[03:53:11] <arc_> ShadeS anyway, regarding your code, when people say "adding this code breaks what's below it" that always makes me think it's a syntax error
[03:54:46] <hellyeah> arc_: it is still fired https://jsfiddle.net/york5b6m/
[03:54:52] <hellyeah> ah
[03:54:55] <hellyeah> understand
[03:54:56] <hellyeah> sorry
[03:55:15] <ShadeS> arc_: that 'what's' a syntax error
[03:55:24] <ShadeS> can you define it?
[03:55:34] <arc_> are you asking me what a syntax error is?
[03:55:47] <ShadeS> with that set interval functoin the new twatts get generated but the 'div' onclick didn't
[03:55:48] <hellyeah> syntax error is like missin {
[03:55:50] <ShadeS> arc_: no
[03:56:11] <ShadeS> define it: "makes me think it's a "
[03:56:29] <arc_> try moving the setinterval function below the div event binding and see what happens
[03:56:57] <ShadeS> arc_: that's actually where it is right now
[03:56:59] <arc_> wait
[03:57:03] <ShadeS> i just pasted it first into the bpaste
[03:57:15] <arc_> are you trying to click these divs that are being generated by the setinterval function
[03:57:40] <ShadeS> yes
[03:57:44] <ShadeS> that's a thing i'd like to happen
[03:58:04] <arc_> ok. then it's not working because you need to use event delegation
[03:58:28] <arc_> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[03:59:40] <arc_> what you're doing is running code at the time the page runs, which sets static event listeners on all of the divs that exist on the page at that time
[03:59:49] <arc_> any divs that are added later will not have any event listeners bound to them
[04:00:17] <arc_> so you need to instead bind your event listener to a parent element, and listen for events that fire on child divs
[04:00:46] <arc_> this is made possible by the event bubbling i was talking about earlier
[04:01:16] <arc_> there are no event listeners bound to those divs you are generating, but the parent element's listener can see the event.target, which is the div you are clicking on
[04:01:45] <ShadeS> well the event is supposed to happen /on click/ so there wouldn't be an event listener bound until a click happens, right?
[04:02:24] <arc_> no. an event listener is bound when the page runs. it then listens for whatever event you specified, in this case clicks
[04:03:57] <ShadeS> 8 |
[04:04:04] <ShadeS> this makes things difficult for me
[04:04:08] <arc_> howso
[04:04:09] <ShadeS> once I add things, i can't click them
[04:04:17] <arc_> i just explained how to do that
[04:04:26] <ShadeS> with 'event-delegation' ?
[04:04:28] <arc_> yes
[04:04:36] <arc_> [04:00:20] <arc_> so you need to instead bind your event listener to a parent element, and listen for events that fire on child divs
[04:04:49] <arc_> that page i linked explains how it works and shows you the syntax
[04:08:01] <ShadeS> so "$( "#list a" ).on( "click", function( event ) {" == undelaged event  && "$( "#list" ).on( "click", "a", function( event ) { " === delegated to 'a' ??
[04:08:23] <arc_> correct
[04:09:08] <ShadeS> if I'm understanding it right then i have to $($section or better $('.row.one').on('click, 'div', function ( event . . . for it to start behaving properly again?
[04:09:54] <arc_> the first selector is usually the first parent element that contains all of the target elements you want the event to fire for
[04:10:07] <arc_> without seeing your html i can't really say what exactly that would be
[04:10:16] <arc_> but just from what you are showing me, i would say that is probably what you need to do
[04:10:27] <PayMeInSteak> would anyone be able to help me figure out why this hover ani wont work?  when i have it as a css :hover it works, but not as an .addClass jquery function https://jsfiddle.net/vfaemLsj/
[04:10:35] <ShadeS> all the <divs> are children of a <section> element, which is the first section element on the page
[04:10:46] <ShadeS> that section element has the class names "row first"
[04:11:25] <arc_> then you could just use .first as the selector, assuming that's unique
[04:12:02] <ShadeS> probably
[04:12:10] <ShadeS> i'm hoping to not create a bucnh of work for myself doing stuff on first
[04:12:18] <ShadeS> cause it turns out the thing i have in row 2 i might want to move to row 1
[04:12:27] <ShadeS> and the stuff i have in row 1 i might want to now have in row 2
[04:12:31] <ShadeS> ;(
[04:13:13] <arc_> i'm sorry, i can't really help you without being able to see your html and know what you're doing
[04:13:19] <arc_> but it's not really that hard to create another event binding
[04:13:21] <Uhkis> PayMeInSteak: seems to work fine. https://jsfiddle.net/vfaemLsj/1/
[04:13:23] <arc_> for now just see if this works
[04:13:46] <arc_> Uhkis i think he wants it to animate
[04:13:52] <PayMeInSteak> 0.o
[04:14:05] <arc_> at least that's what "ani" means to me
[04:14:24] <Uhkis> PayMeInSteak: what i did was: add jquery from the javascript menu
[04:14:38] <arc_> lol : /
[04:15:15] <ShadeS> no, I've just been at this stuff all day
[04:15:19] <ShadeS> doing various precourse work stuff
[04:15:24] <ShadeS> i was struggling with some recursion stuff before
[04:15:24] <Uhkis> arc_: not sure if it's the new UI or do people just assume jQuery is globally enabled everywhere :D
[04:15:38] <arc_> probably sometimes one sometimes the other
[04:16:07] <arc_> i wonder how hard it would be for jsfiddle to try to detect that you're using jquery and have a notification saying "it looks like you're trying to use jquery. do you want to enable it?" or tell you how to do it
[04:16:53] <arc_> we see that issue several times per day
[04:16:54] <Uhkis> arc_: sounds pretty simple if it would just check $( or something
[04:19:47] <ShadeS> arc_: is there a handy way of copying all the HTML that's been generated after the page loads?
[04:20:21] <ShadeS> like, what's rendered, not the js stuff that renders it
[04:20:35] <arc_> umm... not really
[04:20:42] <arc_> what are you actually trying to accomplish
[04:20:44] <ShadeS> tahts' really unfortunate
[04:20:48] <ShadeS> copying it so you could look at it lol
[04:21:08] <arc_> i mean .. you could put it into a container
[04:21:14] <Uhkis> should be doable with mutationobserver
[04:21:41] <arc_> hmm, never seen that
[04:21:53] <Uhkis> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[04:23:59] <Uhkis> there's also deprecated https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Mutation_events
[04:26:50] <ShadeS> ok somethings not quite right with this event handler bidness
[04:26:59] <arc_> howso
[04:27:27] <ShadeS> even before i try to put any new ones on when i changed ('div').on('click', function(event) { to ('one').on('click', 'div', function(event) { ... it doesn't work anymore
[04:27:52] <arc_> it's $('.one').on
[04:27:54] <Uhkis> ShadeS: your selector for one is wrong
[04:28:16] <ShadeS> oh it should be .one
[04:28:20] <arc_> yes
[04:28:34] <Uhkis> tag .class #id
[04:28:53] <ShadeS> $('.one').on('click','div', function(event) { doesn't work either
[04:29:07] <arc_> sigh
[04:29:25] <arc_> can i see your code as it is now
[04:29:28] <ShadeS> Uhkis: yeah I forgot
[04:29:35] <ShadeS> yeah sure I guess i can bpaste the whole thing
[04:30:43] <arc_> including the relevant html
[04:31:02] <ShadeS> the code is within the html
[04:31:15] <ShadeS> i'd like to just give you the whole post generated html code but idk how to easily copy it
[04:31:26] <arc_> don't worry about it
[04:31:30] <arc_> i don't need that
[04:31:39] <ShadeS> https://bpaste.net/show/7142eed89f18
[04:32:18] <arc_> okay, why is your script in body
[04:32:26] <ShadeS> as it stands right now, if i cilck on a user's name or more particualrly the initially generated divs, then the behavior for the $('div').on('click' works just fine
[04:32:32] <ShadeS> arc_: that's how the skeleton was given to me
[04:33:23] <ShadeS> it deliberately had var $body = $('body'); and $body.html(''); in it so I couldn't just add <section> tags in myself, I /have/ to use jQuery to manipulate /everything/
[04:33:29] <arc_> the div.row.one does not exist at the time the page is run
[04:33:35] <arc_> it is also being generated by the script
[04:33:39] <ShadeS> yes that's true
[04:33:45] <arc_> so you cannot use it for your binding
[04:33:58] <ShadeS> the way it is right now
[04:34:01] <ShadeS> as soon as the page loads
[04:34:24] <ShadeS> it stuffs 11 tweets with that first while loop in there (which is what the skeleton had)
[04:34:57] <ShadeS> i then later impelmented the $('div').on('click' thing and the behavior in that function WORKS
[04:35:21] <arc_> ignore that
[04:35:28] <arc_> the first available parent element is unfortunately body
[04:35:47] <arc_> you don't really want to bind an event listener to body that listens to all click events on all divs inside body
[04:35:56] <arc_> so how about you assign a class to these generated divs
[04:36:04] <arc_> on line 32
[04:36:18] <arc_> then instead of delegating to div, you can delegate to the class
[04:36:26] <ShadeS> well that's not really 'forbidden' and there wasn't anything saying I ouldn't do that but I just didn't think to do so
[04:36:51] <arc_> i understand. i'm just telling you it's not really a good idea to bind an event listener to body that listens to all click events on all divs inside body
[04:36:58] <ShadeS> as it stands, as soon as I click the append button, the div.onclik thing only works for the stuff that was on the page before appen appended to the page
[04:37:03] <ShadeS> yeah I hear you
[04:37:28] <arc_> so do you understand how i'm saying to proceed from here?
[04:37:38] <ShadeS> almost
[04:37:49] <arc_> what are you confused about
[04:37:57] <ShadeS> i'm still processing the bind an event listener to body that listens to all click events on all divs inside that body
[04:38:02] <ShadeS> and trying ot understand what that means
[04:38:29] <ShadeS> '<div class="tweets"></div>' is now my line 32
[04:38:55] <arc_> ok. so now you can do $('body').on('click', '.tweets', function () { ... });
[04:39:44] <ShadeS> is it generally bad to bind it to the WHOLE BODY ? i thought you typically want to bind things you're clicking on, to the specific thing that's being clicked on
[04:40:12] <arc_> it depends on the situation. unfortunately there's nothing in your page that exists when the page runs
[04:40:55] <arc_> it doesn't matter that much though. like i said earlier, events bubble up, so they would be firing on body anyway.
[04:41:15] <arc_> as long as you're selecting the .tweets class, the function will only run when you click on a .tweets div
[04:41:20] <ShadeS> there's so much to this jquery stuff and it's hard to have it all sink in at once
[04:42:31] <arc_> actually, you didn't even have a section with class 'one'. it was 'first'
[04:42:56] <arc_> anyway, it should work doing it the way i mentioned
[04:43:26] <arc_> and this way, if there are .tweets divs loaded into the other rows, those will also work with the same binding
[04:43:38] <ShadeS> aaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeeeeeesome.
[04:43:49] <ShadeS> i think it's starting to work the way I'm being asked to impelement it
[04:43:57] <ShadeS> while also getting a slightly better understanding of jquery
[04:44:06] <arc_> i hope you do understand
[04:44:13] <arc_> that's more important than just getting it to work
[04:44:30] <delboy1978uk> has anyone here used http://editor.datatables.net?
[04:44:39] <ShadeS> well we were initially working on a premise of <section class="row one"> being in the html
[04:44:47] <ShadeS> then you found out the html is entirey blank and the only thing there is 'body'
[04:45:02] <arc_> it's row first :p
[04:45:13] <arc_> it helps if you remember your html too
[04:45:25] <ShadeS> and in my specific circumstance i can't do any dynamic behavior click handling on anything EXCEPT body, since it's all dynamically generated
[04:45:34] <ShadeS> except for the initial page generation apparently
[04:45:36] <ShadeS> which i don't get
[04:46:01] <ShadeS> arc_: why did $('div').on('click' work initially for the first ten tweets that were put on the page when the page loaded
[04:46:16] <ShadeS> but not after any ones that were appended after that
[04:46:23] <ShadeS> since the first ten were also dynamically generated
[04:46:27] <ShadeS> that's what i odn't get
[04:46:31] <arc_> okay
[04:46:57] <arc_> the code runs in order
[04:47:06] <arc_> the binding is below that code on the page
[04:47:27] <arc_> so you can bind to those divs that are generated by javascript
[04:47:44] <arc_> but the setinterval function runs after the page loads
[04:47:50] <arc_> so you cannot bind to those divs
[04:48:20] <arc_> i made a mistake in thinking you could not bind to section.row.first
[04:48:37] <arc_> it wasn't because it didn't exist, it was because you said the class was 'one' when it was 'first'
[04:48:47] <arc_> you can bind to that, because it's before the binding in your code
[04:49:31] <arc_> but setinterval is always going to run something after the page loads, by its very nature
[04:49:40] <arc_> so if you're generating html in there, you can't bind to any of it
[04:51:39] <ShadeS> setInterval is commented out now
[04:51:44] <ShadeS> as i wanted that behavior to really be done on click
[04:51:56] <ShadeS> well i was asked to do it either onclick or as new tweets roll in
[04:52:03] <ShadeS> and i'm not sure how to do it on new tweets being rolled in
[04:52:08] <ShadeS> so i set a timer
[04:52:15] <Uhkis> there's probably an event for that
[04:52:45] <ShadeS> idk how this jquery stuff works
[04:52:49] <ShadeS> i'm less than 48hrs into it
[04:52:57] <ShadeS> like X-treme jNub
[04:53:05] <arc_> you would have to look at data_generator.js and figure out what function is adding new tweets, then bind a callback to it
[04:53:20] <ShadeS> i'm burnt out for the night
[04:53:24] <ShadeS> idk if i could do this
[04:53:26] <ShadeS> meaningfully
[04:53:32] <ShadeS> since i don't know how to bindcallbacks even
[04:53:40] <arc_> it's pretty simple
[04:53:52] <arc_> but if you're burnt out, take a break
[04:53:53] <ShadeS> i see a var generateRandomTweet function defined
[04:54:45] <ShadeS> this looks like it do, var scheduleNextTweet = function() { generateRandomTweet(); setTimeout(scheduleNextTweet, Math.random() * 1500) };
[04:55:31] <arc_> okay, so you can bind a callback to generateRandomTweet https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[04:56:01] <arc_> i guess this is for a class or something?
[04:56:40] <ShadeS> arc_: precourse work
[04:57:36] <arc_> i guess i don't know what that is, but it doesn't really matter
[04:57:52] <ShadeS> arc_: it's stuff I have to finish before I an be even accepted INTO the class
[04:57:56] <arc_> oh
[04:58:09] <ShadeS> yeah, it's /like that/
[04:59:29] <ShadeS> so briefly looking at this
[04:59:55] <ShadeS> i have to create a variable forthese call backs
[05:00:09] <ShadeS> var callbacks = $.Callbacks();
[05:01:09] <ShadeS> then I have to add the function i wanna call back, in my case scheduleNextTweet, as so callbacks.add(scheduleNextTweet );
[05:01:12] <arc_> basically the variable becomes a name for a list of callbacks
[05:01:15] <arc_> in case you want multiple lists
[05:01:21] <arc_> but you don' thave to worry about that
[05:01:34] <ShadeS> the only thing I'm not sure of is how it would work since scheduleNextTweet isn't in my <body><script></script></body> it's in a separate file
[05:01:42] <arc_> that doesn't matter
[05:01:55] <ShadeS> it.. doesnt?
[05:02:01] <arc_> no
[05:02:08] <ShadeS> oh yeah i see it's in the head
[05:02:13] <ShadeS> that mean anything in it i can now use
[05:02:19] <arc_> correct
[05:02:24] <ShadeS> or have access to rather
[05:04:22] <arc_> i'm sorry .. i may have fundamentally misunderstood what this is
[05:05:03] <arc_> now that i'm looking at this fully i actually don't understand what the purpose of it is at all
[05:07:07] <ShadeS> arc_: lolol
[05:07:09] <ShadeS> purpose of what
[05:07:45] <arc_> these callbacks lists
[05:08:29] <PayMeInSteak> how does jquey know what css file to take classes and id's and elements from?
[05:08:51] <arc_> it doesn't. it uses the computed styles
[05:09:10] <Mark____> i have a question : is it possible to make contents become invisible or at least have opacity value as i scroll through, so that they become gradually invisible?
[05:09:27] <arc_> sure
[05:10:14] <Mark____> hi arc.
[05:10:32] <ShadeS> so to reiterate what I learned what that I cannot bind to the divs that were beign dynamically generated ON click, but I could bind to the ones that were in the original loop because they weren't in any on click
[05:10:55] <arc_> hi
[05:11:03] <ShadeS> =does that make sense?
[05:11:24] <arc_> ShadeS it's the difference between something that existed before your binding was run in the code, and something that didn't exist until after your binding was run in the code
[05:11:46] <arc_> yes what you said makes sense
[05:11:52] <arc_> i'm just being more precise
[05:17:24] <Mark____> is it possible to make contents become gradually invisible as i scroll through?
[05:17:42] <arc_> "sure" was an answer to that
[05:17:51] <Mark____> but how?
[05:18:00] <Mark____> i can think of addclass but that’s not really solution
[05:18:21] <arc_> bind on scroll event and set css opacity to some math function based on the scroll position
[05:18:27] <Mark____> ...
[05:18:30] <Mark____> um.
[05:18:44] <Mark____> my knowledge doesn’t let me start from scratch
[05:18:52] <arc_> okay
[05:18:53] <Mark____> can you be more precise in helping as well?
[05:19:21] <arc_> well that's a pretty involved problem
[05:19:40] <ShadeS> arc_: thanks
[05:19:44] <arc_> np
[05:19:47] <ShadeS> i might need a refersher in the morning on what i learned
[05:19:59] <ShadeS> it was k^H^H^H^^H is very late
[05:20:52] <arc_> Mark____ i'm sorry but i can't really get into that right now. i was hoping a nudge in the right direction would be all you needed
[05:21:02] <Mark____> okay. thanks though
[05:24:01] <Mark____> okay.
[05:24:08] <Mark____> so this will work. https://jsfiddle.net/fjfj97zf/1/
[05:24:16] <Mark____> but how do i make it *gradually* disappear
[05:24:18] <Mark____> that’s the question lol
[05:25:46] <arc_> Mark____ do you want it to animate away once you scroll past a threshold or do you want the opacity to actually be based on the scroll position
[05:26:02] <Mark____> second one.
[05:26:06] <Mark____> tricky/
[05:27:26] <arc_> then you need some math function that will return 1 for any value of the scroll position that is less than or equal to where you want it to start fading out
[05:27:46] <arc_> and return something between 0 and 1 for any position between where you want it to start fading out and where you want it to finish fading out
[05:27:55] <Mark____> sounds insanely complicate.
[05:27:57] <Mark____> *d
[05:27:57] <arc_> and return 0 for anything greater than or equal to where you want it to finish fading out
[05:28:05] <Mark____> my math skill won’t do.
[05:28:08] <Mark____> that’s C++ work.
[05:28:30] <arc_> there's no reason that can't be done in javascript. i'm sure all the same math functions are available
[05:28:46] <Uhkis> Mark____: something like this https://jsfiddle.net/aqc7fx7o/2/
[05:29:25] <Mark____> hmm
[05:29:26] <Mark____> interesting.
[05:29:28] <Mark____> sec
[05:29:43] <arc_> yeah something like that, except i'm guessing it has to start at a certain position and end at a certain position
[05:36:05] <Mark____> Uhkis:  what is this ‘opacity: newOpacity’ thing?
[05:36:14] <Mark____> cani just type in new opacity?
[05:36:45] <arc_> newOpacity is a variable
[05:36:49] <Mark____> i see.
[05:36:56] <arc_> it's defined in there
[05:37:04] <Mark____> OH
[05:37:08] <Mark____> sorry.missed it
[05:41:26] <Mark____> there is one more problem.
[05:41:47] <Mark____> if i use the code you gave me Uhkis, it ALL fades out
[05:42:05] <Mark____> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/request
[05:42:42] <Mark____> instead, i need only the ones that reaches certain scroll to be faded.
[05:45:00] <arc_> that's what i was saying
[05:45:04] <Mark____> okay.
[05:45:12] <arc_> he wasn't trying to solve your whole problem, just give you a demonstration :p
[05:45:16] <Mark____> i know.
[05:45:26] <Mark____> im trying for the solution right now, and im working my * off
[05:45:45] <Mark____> but can;’t really think of any.
[05:47:46] <bounceman> Hi, I replace a string with the following code http://codepad.org/DQVVxqzb what if I want to replace both "fm" and "em" with "" ?
[05:47:53] <bounceman> since it's a return
[05:48:28] <delboy1978uk> can anyone help? I’m trying to set a value in an object http://jsbin.com/rosojodezo/edit?js,console
[05:50:14] <bounceman> nvm I got it
[05:56:12] <Mark____> i don’t know if anyone knows how to do this, but is there anyway i can make only the item that’s exactly on the vertical center more standout than others? i don’t even know what’s the proper term for this effect.
[05:56:50] <Mark____> so as i scroll through, only the item that’s on the center become enlarged,
[05:57:06] <Mark____> and go backs to shrink as i scroll down.
[05:58:14] <arc_> yes that's also possible, but probably significantly more complicated than the opacity thing
[05:58:55] <delboy1978uk> how do i get the name of a key from a POJO? http://jsbin.com/rosojodezo/edit?js,console
[05:59:16] <Mark____> yeah i assume so. it’s this one https://note19.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/statepicker.jpg
[05:59:37] <Mark____> i think it’s more like css 3d thing.
[06:01:22] <arc_> that's a prebaked ios interface element
[06:02:19] <Mark____> hmm im guessing it’s hard to expect any help from irc channel.
[06:02:23] <Mark____> stackoverflow it is
[06:09:07] <jquery141> yesaagh
[06:10:22] <arc_> Mark____ it's also sometime between 3am and noon for a large portion of the channel
[06:10:36] <Mark____> oh okay.
[06:10:37] <Uhkis> 13:10!
[06:10:40] <arc_> so sleeping or at work
[06:13:36] <Uhkis> hopefully not sleeping at work
[06:22:31] <arc_> Uhkis can you possibly give me any kind of example of what this would ever be used for https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[06:23:12] <arc_> the examples they give are completely barebones
[06:25:53] <apter> Hi! I would like the fullscreenbutton on an HTML5 <video> remap to a javascriptfunction is this possible?
[06:33:02] <xec> please don't sue me :(
[06:36:06] <Uhkis> arc_: can't think of any really
[06:36:18] <arc_> lol, all right thanks
[06:36:32] <arc_> i certainly can't either
[06:36:42] <hellyeah> hey
[06:37:55] <rindolf> hellyeah: hello-yeah
[06:38:17] <Uhkis> arc_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8070894/when-would-i-use-jquery-callbacks even SO has that question :D
[06:39:15] <hellyeah> you can create many datepckers here. When you select dates you will se e pencil button i want to remove spesific range of dates belongs to spesific datepicker. You will see date of range is colorized in jqx calendar. Actually it is kinda spesific question. Any idea here? http://jsfiddle.net/rsw4z8tw/9/
[06:40:39] <Uhkis> the word is specific :)
[06:41:27] <arc_> Uhkis lol. nice
[06:41:57] <hellyeah> this is very spesific
[06:44:20] <Mark____> does anyone know how to make the edges rotate like this one? https://note19.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/statepicker.jpg
[06:45:08] <arc_> i think that's just an optical illusion
[06:45:44] <Mark____> well,
[06:45:55] <Mark____> it not really delusion, there is acutall effect on it
[06:46:28] <arc_> yeah there's a gradient on the thing that rotates
[06:46:40] <arc_> but the text doesn't change shape or size
[06:46:58] <Mark____> they do actually, if you look at it closely
[06:47:13] <Mark____> they areslightly more bent towards upperside and downside
[06:48:27] <Uhkis> yeah, that's the optical illusion
[06:50:09] <Mark____> too many questions to ask.. to achieve this simple graphic effects.. sigh
[06:50:31] <arc_> i opened the image in photoshop and typed over the word
[06:50:36] <arc_> it's literally the exact same pixels
[06:51:08] <Uhkis> jquery mythbusters :D
[06:51:23] <arc_> lol
[06:52:51] <Uhkis> https://marinovdh.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/use-the-iphone-uipickerview-control-as-a-selectbox-on-your-website-with-jquery/ someone has actually made that picker
[06:53:55] <arc_> please only use that on mobile
[06:53:57] <Mark____> itdoesn’t look as real.
[06:54:13] <Mark____> besides, im not using that as picker
[07:09:02] <Martin___> hi
[07:13:27] <Martin___> Can make some images convert to animation(.svg) with JS or jquery ?
[07:19:32] <decx> wat
[07:20:17] <decx> whatever you want to do with svg, jquery wont do it
[07:20:23] <decx> js can do everything tho
[07:20:50] <hellyeah> decx: do you know about jqx calendar?
[07:23:19] <decx> i know all about those 600 line fiddles ^^
[07:23:49] <hellyeah> no
[07:23:51] <hellyeah> :XD
[07:23:56] <hellyeah> this is short one
[07:23:58] <hellyeah> :X:D:D:D:D
[07:24:07] <anli> Can I open the development tools using js?
[07:24:10] <decx> only 300 this time is it
[07:24:20] <decx> no
[07:26:04] <hellyeah> create two datepickers pls select the dates each time you created you will see pencil button you should create datepickers twice when i want to click pencil button i want to remove range of dates belongs to spesific datepickers but it removes all any ideas or tips http://jsfiddle.net/rsw4z8tw/9/
[07:30:58] <hellyeah> any ideas?
[07:31:29] <hellyeah> is it possible to get css class name frpm a selector?
[07:39:30] <decx> like you would any other attribute
[07:41:46] <hellyeah> i mean
[07:41:47] <hellyeah> but
[07:42:05] <hellyeah> i have several class like special1, special2 ... special25
[07:42:15] <hellyeah> commnon word is special
[07:42:27] <hellyeah> i want to know which one is it by using special keyword
[07:43:09] <hellyeah> you understand?
[07:48:06] <decx> no
[07:48:28] <hellyeah> okey
[07:48:33] <hellyeah> not important
[08:18:13] <definity_>  Hi  Im using snap snap SVG. I was wondering if it possible to place text inside a circle?
[08:35:51] <decx> i dont know about snap svg but you just add a text element to the svg, not inside the circle element
[08:37:00] <decx> just have them in the same g to create a clear separation
[08:45:56] <Katot> Hello
[09:02:38] <afidegnum> hello, how do i append  input type='hidden'  the this javascript code? http://hastebin.com/quludafeli.xml
[09:06:06] <decx> you already create and element with an attribute and append it, what holds you back doing the same thing again
[09:06:11] <decx> an element*
[09:12:26] <afidegnum> decx: is it correct ? http://hastebin.com/kosomevobi.sm
[09:13:42] <decx> why do you use different creation patterns?
[09:14:01] <afidegnum> i just copy this snipped
[09:14:03] <decx> now that's just confusing ^^
[09:14:20] <afidegnum> ok,
[09:14:35] <decx> $('<element>', { myattr: val, }) like for the img works well enough
[09:14:40] <decx> but attr works as well
[09:14:44] <decx> up to you
[09:14:52] <decx> it's just better to stay consistent
[09:16:32] <afidegnum> http://hastebin.com/avigawaluy.sm
[09:16:50] <afidegnum> what about this?
[09:22:03] <decx> you dont need to rewrap #Thumb
[09:22:10] <decx> appendTo already does that for you
[09:22:25] <decx> also it's worth trying to minimize appends
[09:22:45] <decx> like you could do img.add(input).appendTo('#Thumb')
[09:22:52] <decx> to add both at once
[09:31:26] <afidegnum> ok
[09:32:44] <afidegnum> decx: can you please check this ?
[09:32:46] <afidegnum>  http://hastebin.com/fohuhoheri.xml
[09:33:03] <decx> that should do yes
[09:33:39] <afidegnum> ok, thanks, let me apply
[09:37:12] <jolink> hello. I am little bit confused with this icon http://prntscr.com/a1fylu can anyone please tell me its name and its site link of which it is the logo
[09:37:25] <jolink> i don't know whether to ask this question here or not?
[09:37:45] <jquery495> how to get a div inside a div inside a div? without writing like this $('div > div > div')
[09:39:03] <jquery495> jolink : http://i.imgur.com/BhpNxUn.png
[09:39:33] <jolink> jquery495: i don't get your point
[09:40:04] <jquery495> jolink: like u asked: please tell me its name and link
[09:40:25] <jolink> lol
[09:40:31] <jolink> I have asked it
[09:40:46] <jquery495> =)
[09:41:09] <jolink> don't mind it plz.
[09:55:44] <afidegnum> decx: http://hastebin.com/uxetegiyef.sm   Uncaught ReferenceError: hidden is not defined
[09:56:00] <decx> no quotes
[09:56:07] <decx> so it looks for the variable hidden
[10:01:03] <afidegnum> ah, ok,
[10:01:09] <Dfar> Hi all, is there any way to have more than one icon inside a listview entry https://jsfiddle.net/nfLab0bL/
[10:04:14] <decx> they are positioned absolutely so now
[10:04:32] <decx> just use your own alignment, with blackjack and hookers
[10:04:37] <decx> in fact, forget the icon
[10:05:47] <hellyeah> hey there
[10:06:01] <hellyeah> &who's shoky
[10:06:10] <hellyeah> ops
[10:06:28] <marduk198> can i alert the prev page url?
[10:07:37] <decx> you mean document.referrer?
[10:08:47] <marduk198> decx exacly that. thanks
[10:09:51] <decx> i'm on a roll today
[10:09:59] <decx> give me all you got hellyeah ^^
[10:12:57] <hellyeah> decx: create one datepicker and select the date then create second datepicker select the date you will see pencil button beside first datepicker click first pencil button you will see it removed spesific date also first day from second datepicker. My aim is to remove dates from below calendar which is colorized when you click spesific pencil button
[10:12:57] <hellyeah> . Is there anyway you can suggest to me for doing this? Hope my question is understandable http://jsfiddle.net/rsw4z8tw/10/
[10:14:29] <decx> what's with the sudden let
[10:14:56] <hellyeah> sudden let?
[10:15:02] <hellyeah> what do you mean?_
[10:15:04] <decx> let inside a function gives 0 benefit compared to var
[10:15:17] <decx> and without the version attribute doesnt work in firefox
[10:15:24] <hellyeah> humm
[10:15:34] <hellyeah> i just try to learn it
[10:15:42] <hellyeah> i can change it to var
[10:15:55] <decx> let has its main benefit in blocks
[10:16:01] <decx> like if or for
[10:16:10] <decx> so you can have a local local var
[10:16:25] <hellyeah> let in if or for gotcha
[10:18:19] <decx> what you want to do is set the date range
[10:18:29] <decx> which is done with the beforeShowDay function
[10:18:30] <hellyeah> for removing
[10:18:36] <decx> yeah it's the same thing
[10:18:41] <hellyeah> well this is jqx calendar
[10:18:51] <hellyeah> not jquery ui datepicker
[10:18:57] <decx> doesnt that just use ui datepicker
[10:19:25] <hellyeah> i am using datepicker for selecting dates
[10:19:37] <hellyeah> and these range of date are colorized in jqx calendar
[10:19:56] <hellyeah> when i click pencil button i want to remove spesific range of date from jqx calendar
[10:20:02] <Es0teric> if i am using jquery ui sortable, how do i take the index of a sortable item?
[10:20:04] <hellyeah> i mean remove the special dates
[10:20:05] <Es0teric> and replace it
[10:20:06] <spacebiscuit> i have a listener on a radio input field
[10:20:16] <decx> sure i'd knew how to do it in ui datepicker ^^
[10:20:17] <spacebiscuit> when it is clicked the page scrolls to the top
[10:20:27] <spacebiscuit> i tried preventDefault(en)
[10:20:38] <Dfar> Is there a better way to have two button inside a listview, like this https://jsfiddle.net/rgpjxma6/ ?
[10:20:42] <spacebiscuit> but no matter what it scrolls, how to stop it?
[10:21:10] <hellyeah> decx: is it possible to make it in jquery datepicker?
[10:23:37] <decx> well yeah
[10:23:50] <decx> probably also in jqx
[10:23:56] <decx> somehow ^^
[10:24:21] <hellyeah> i can colorize the calendar in jqx calendar
[10:24:32] <hellyeah> i cannot remove special dates from calendar
[10:24:37] <hellyeah> but hey i found an example
[10:24:58] <hellyeah> decx: that can help
[10:26:51] <hellyeah> decx: any particular help may be small demo :X
[10:27:29] <Es0teric> i have an h3, how do i remove items inside of the h3 and add a new text in it or something
[10:27:53] <hellyeah> $('h3').val("")
[10:28:07] <decx> val is for form elements
[10:28:13] <hellyeah> ah sorry
[10:28:16] <hellyeah> :p
[10:28:17] <decx> use html(), text()
[10:28:49] <Es0teric> hellyeah i am using jquery ui sortable on update and i have this: ui.item.find('h3').val(ui.item.index());
[10:28:59] <Es0teric> so its function(event, ui) }
[10:29:06] <Es0teric> * function(event, ui) {}
[10:29:36] <hellyeah> decx knows better then me
[10:30:57] <Es0teric> hellyeah ok
[10:31:22] <juslintek> Can anyone consult me. Here go to this link: http://www.kiekreikia.lt/#menu-item-405
[10:31:29] <juslintek> press the focused link
[10:31:37] <juslintek> Popup comes up
[10:31:49] <juslintek> And when you scroll down you should see even grid which is very small.
[10:31:58] <juslintek> But when you switch tabs
[10:32:13] <juslintek> and come back it grows to its size. What might cause this?
[10:32:34] <juslintek> Its Essential Grid used
[10:33:14] <hellyeah> i guess i will go for datepicker
[10:35:09] <juslintek> And popup script is popmake
[10:41:06] <Es0teric> anyone here know jquery ui?
[10:43:32] <arup_r> Hi.. Need one idea. This exactly what I need http://jsfiddle.net/XQ8Fw/ .. except I want the dropdown to show results, on input but no on focus ?
[10:43:38] <arup_r> How to do it ?
[10:59:11] <Es0teric> ok so i am stuck on this right here...
[11:17:35] <ckb> Hey guys, not sure if this is a jq issue or css, but I have a scrollable div, and I'm trying to add an overlay only for that div. is there a way I can simply get the "height" of a div with overflow: scroll;?
[11:17:58] <decx> scrollHeight
[11:18:13] <ckb> $("#el").scrollHeight is returning undefined?
[11:18:36] <decx> scrollHeight is a native property
[11:18:44] <decx> $('#el').prop('scrollHeight')
[11:18:55] <ckb> thanks a bunch!
[11:19:18] <ckb> Why doesn't .eq(0).scrollHeight work? .eq returns a jQ object?
[11:19:26] <decx> yes
[11:19:54] <ckb> Works perfectly, thanks deck!
[11:19:58] <Brodingo> you could use .get(0) or [0]
[11:19:59] <ckb> auto correct bleh
[11:20:06] <Es0teric> i have 5 items in a list that are sortable using jquery ui sortable -- how would i go about changing the index of each item since the position is supposed to start at 1 ?
[11:25:16] <Es0teric> anyone?
[11:25:56] <Ty_> Hey guys, what's goin on?
[11:28:39] <Ty_> Can you use "if($('.class-name).hasClass('specific-class')) { } to show/hide content between divs that are positioned absolute?
[11:38:08] <taplar> hmm?
[11:39:51] <Ty_> If i have my slides that are positioned absolute (so they are out of page flow) and so is my timeline, can I use an if statement to check if a slide has a certain class and show hide content based of it's class?
[11:42:01] <taplar> sure
[11:42:31] <taplar> i mean
[11:42:50] <taplar> the classes are just used for selecting elements and testing
[11:43:06] <taplar> anything related to what the css does, that's not really related
[11:43:35] <Ty_> Well I was wondering since they are out of the flow, that it can't pick it up?
[11:43:50] <taplar> what do you mean out of the flow?
[11:44:03] <Ty_> remember how I had multiple timelines? I brought it down to 1, but since it's pos. absolute, it's not inside any specific div
[11:44:18] <taplar> so it's detached?
[11:44:25] <Ty_> Yep :)
[11:44:48] <taplar> ok, well then there are two approaches to that, which is really css approaches
[11:45:19] <taplar> your either going to change the css for specific elements (inline styling) or your going to structure your css rules so that they are based on nesting
[11:45:31] <taplar> the later doesn't care when the elements are attached
[11:47:02] <Es0teric> i have 5 items in a list that are sortable using jquery ui sortable -- how would i go about changing the index of each item since the position is supposed to start at 1 ?
[11:47:55] <Ty_> The problem with nesting is, that I can't base it per section of the slider
[11:48:39] <taplar> nesting may have been a bad choice of words.  basicly the difference between stylesheet rules vs inline rules
[11:49:47] <Ty_> So you're saying to do :   .target-panels > connect-sub{
[11:49:51] <Ty_> display:none;
[11:50:11] <taplar> that could be a solution
[11:50:22] <Ty_> But I don't believe that would work, since the timeline isn't nested
[11:50:38] <taplar> when you attach the timeline, what are you attaching it to?
[11:51:29] <Ty_> It's floating outside of all wrappers
[11:51:40] <taplar> so it's just an element on the body
[11:51:55] <Ty_> so it's like <body> <timeline> <wrapper> <slide></body>
[11:51:58] <Ty_> yup
[11:52:52] <taplar> ok, so that's fine.  you could define your styles on the timeline, or if you want to conditionally change the styling on the child of the timeline you could define other classes that when paired with the timeline change the behavior
[11:53:42] <Ty_> Is that still specific to css? or are we now looking into JS?
[11:54:14] <taplar> it's both.  the css would be the rules, the js would be responsible for adding/removing the classes that change the behavior
[11:54:32] <Ty_> Okay, I think that's what I've been trying to do
[11:55:04] <Ty_> I hid all the subsections, then was going to use the if statement to find when the active panel had a class of target, to display:block the target subsection
[11:55:46] <taplar> so why not do .class-name.specific-class { display: block; }
[11:56:15] <Ty_> Because it has to change based on what slide they're on
[11:56:38] <taplar> you only want them to be display block when the specific class is on them, yes?
[11:56:55] <Ty_> Yes, but it's not a class on the timeline
[11:57:00] <Ty_> it's a class on the slide
[11:57:16] <taplar> ok so
[11:57:24] <Ty_> currently have: if($('.active-tour').hasClass('target-panel')) {       $(".target-sub").css("display", "block"); }
[11:57:38] <taplar> target sub is a child of active tour?
[11:58:36] <taplar> or what is their relation?
[11:58:56] <Ty_> Target sub is class of the UL nested in an LI of the timeline
[11:58:57] <Ty_> http://pastebin.com/De0CpNp9
[12:01:10] <taplar> ok, so active-tour does not belong to any of that
[12:03:47] <Ty_> No
[12:03:57] <Ty_> active tour is a class given to the current panel showing
[12:04:05] <taplar> so sure, that statement is fine
[12:04:38] <taplar> provided those elements are in the dom
[12:06:21] <Ty_> They should be in the dom, but it's not throwing any errors either
[12:06:40] <taplar> thought you said something was detached
[12:06:59] <Ty_> What do you mean detached?
[12:07:20] <Ty_> I mean , if you position something relative, it is on a different plane than something positioned absolute
[12:07:37] <taplar> detached means it's been removed from the dom, but you have a variable reference to it
[12:07:45] <Zzaichik> well…. not really.
[12:08:09] <taplar> *not attached, be it removed or never attached in the first place
[12:08:52] <taplar> var blah = $('<div>'); would be a detached div
[12:08:55] <Ty_> Well it is brought in, in the body, then positioned absolute
[12:09:04] <taplar> ok so your fine
[12:10:19] <Ty_> if I search: $('.active-tour'); in my console, it returns []
[12:10:35] <taplar> so they don't exist
[12:10:49] <taplar> hold on
[12:10:51] <Ty_> I suppose not
[12:10:53] <taplar> on your site or in fiddle?
[12:11:11] <Ty_> I have my site: https://preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/template/multi?template_layout_id=3862706608&is_buffered_template_layout=true&portalId=494351&tc_deviceCategory=DESKTOP
[12:11:16] <taplar> yeah, so they don't exist
[12:12:18] <Ty_> hmm, is that due to the JS on them?
[12:12:53] <taplar> dunno, i'd assume so
[12:14:03] <Es0teric> can anyone help me with my jquery ui sortable issue?
[12:20:23] <Ty_> So do you think your solution would still apply?
[12:21:52] <taplar> make sure those elements exist in the dom when you do that statement with a console log
[12:22:11] <taplar> if they are detached, you can still do that logic, but you would have to do the actions on the variables with the references
[12:28:59] <Es0teric> is there anyone here
[12:29:01] <Es0teric> that can help me with my jquery ui problem?
[12:29:58] <Ty_> Whats the issue?
[12:31:10] <Es0teric> Ty_ i basically have an index issue.. i want to use jquery ui sortable and have the first index start at 1 and then anything after that would be a + 1 or a - 1
[12:31:58] <Ty_> JS array/indexes start at 0
[12:32:19] <Es0teric> Ty_ i know rthat
[12:32:29] <Es0teric> that *
[12:33:23] <Es0teric> Ty_ i still want it to start at 1 from that sortable index context
[12:34:07] <Ty_> You could use an if statement
[12:34:28] <Ty_> so if your var === 0, to return true;
[12:34:59] <Es0teric> Ty_ i want to do this on the update method of the sortable
[12:35:18] <Ty_> Do you have your code?
[12:36:04] <decx> why start at 1
[12:36:10] <decx> i dont get it
[12:36:20] <Es0teric> decx because i am returning positions from the database
[12:36:28] <decx> so?
[12:36:29] <Es0teric> database has 1-5 not 0-4
[12:36:51] <Es0teric> my requirements are not going to change
[12:36:54] <decx> do that when you itneract with your db
[12:36:59] <Es0teric> i want the index to start at 1
[12:37:05] <decx> not gonna happen
[12:37:43] <Es0teric> so you're saying, decx that if i have a sortable update i cannot have the index start at 1?
[12:37:53] <Es0teric> or end at 1
[12:38:02] <Es0teric> if the position is actually 0
[12:38:28] <decx> yes
[12:39:42] <Es0teric> decx alright so if i do it at the db level
[12:39:59] <Es0teric> how would i do that? if pos == 0 pos+1 ?
[12:40:02] <Es0teric> before i insert
[12:40:49] <decx> i can only speculate
[12:42:01] <daslicht> just keep teh db's index and modify when you get the results
[12:43:46] <huck5> I'm trying to replace a datepicker with a selectmenu. I've got something like this going on ... https://gist.github.com/Huck5/94774564116f47fbea41 . I keep getting "NotFoundError: Node was not found", and I'm not sure why..
[12:44:03] <huck5> What's the best way to replace one jQuery UI element with another, and keep the jQuery styling?
[13:02:33] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to get the id of an element that has triggered an event. $(event.target) gives me [div#176241.medication, context: div#176241.medication] How can I get the id (I've tried $(event.target.id) which is what most solutions seems to state, but that doesn't work for me)
[13:02:49] <robertmaxrees> this.id
[13:03:04] <robertmaxrees> or event.target.id
[13:03:07] <robertmaxrees> no need to $().
[13:03:07] <quangl> how do i get an angular is the worst
[13:03:32] <taplar_lunch> is that a sentence?
[13:04:39] <decx> a markov chain bot invaded #jquery huh
[13:05:01] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:06:07] <taplar> not meaning to be rude if it's a language issue, but huh?
[13:07:30] <decx> the markov chain process can be used to create "natural" sentences if you have a big enough dataset
[13:07:43] <taplar> i was following up on my previous statement
[13:07:48] <taplar> but cool, :)
[13:07:57] <decx> ^^
[13:08:05] <islalobo> robertmaxrees++
[13:08:54] <huck5> Why would calling .textinput('destroy') an a text-input element cause a "TypeError: a is undefined" ?
[13:09:16] <robertmaxrees> .textinput() is a method?
[13:10:51] <huck5> robertmaxrees, jQuery UI widget... https://api.jquerymobile.com/textinput/#method-destroy
[13:11:08] <huck5> Which means I'm in the wrong channel, doesn't it..
[13:11:12] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:11:12] <taplar> nope
[13:11:15] <robertmaxrees> you're in the right place :)
[13:11:27] <huck5> Oh ok, thought maybe there was a jquery-mobile specific channel.
[13:11:42] * taplar points at the chatroom subject
[13:12:25] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7567
[13:12:28] <robertmaxrees> here's why.
[13:12:46] <decx> lmgtfy'ed
[13:12:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:19:03] <sigdk> hello. I'm having problems with the encoding at the backend. Is there any way to specify the encoding at the ajax request ?
[13:19:30] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:19:38] <Malgorath> What is a good open source method to sort rows in a table?
[13:21:09] <huck5> robertmaxrees, ah. Thanks! That makes sense.
[13:21:12] <robertmaxrees> Malgorath lots of choices.
[13:21:45] <decx> yeah depends what you need Malgorath, starts at a 20 line snippet and ends at giant table sorter libs
[13:21:46] <robertmaxrees> a google search turns up tons of results.
[13:22:18] <Malgorath> Thats why I'm asking what you guys would suggest, lots of choice I'm looking for the most efficient method
[13:22:41] <robertmaxrees> Malgorath "efficient" is overrated ;) what all do you need?  just the ability to sort rows?
[13:23:18] <Malgorath> sort rows, ability to limit rows seen sort multiple rows
[13:23:47] <decx> what does wikipedia use
[13:23:51] <robertmaxrees> so you want more than just the ability to sort rows :) datatables seems really popular though really confusing.
[13:24:11] <Malgorath> ah yes forgot datatables
[13:24:39] <taplar> say what you will about datatables, but it is nice that they have the different plugins for different sorting methods
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> oh absolutely.  we just get a LOT of people asking for support here.
[13:25:06] <taplar> yeah
[13:25:15] <decx> still no channel eh
[13:25:21] <decx> "we do it on our forum"
[13:25:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.  they didn't want to make one.
[13:25:32] <robertmaxrees> i really don't understand why.
[13:25:52] <taplar> heh, probably afraid to get lots of 'improvement' requests live
[13:25:54] <decx> well if you're not already using irc it doesnt make sense to staff a channel
[13:26:13] <robertmaxrees> they don't even need to staff it imo.  just park it and let people find it and start supporting each other.
[13:26:26] <decx> then it might as well be ##
[13:26:31] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:26:49] <taplar> is that the significants of # vs ##?
[13:26:57] <robertmaxrees> topic vs project.
[13:27:30] <taplar> # being topic?
[13:27:34] <decx> # is official
[13:27:36] <robertmaxrees> project.
[13:27:38] <robertmaxrees> "official"
[13:27:39] <taplar> k
[13:27:42] <decx> like this is the official channel for jquery
[13:28:04] <game0> guys, I'm trying to read from json file but there's a problem in my code and I don't know where?
[13:28:10] <robertmaxrees> game0 bummer.
[13:28:16] <game0> it's showing only the first line of json response only
[13:28:17] <decx> blame minorities
[13:28:24] <taplar> fiddle?
[13:28:25] <robertmaxrees> game0 show us what you're doing.

[13:28:40] <game0>  http://pastebin.com/2zaAMyPe
[13:28:42] <robertmaxrees> what does the data look like?
[13:28:54] <game0>  http://pastebin.com/bj5h12Pt
[13:28:59] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[13:29:07] <decx> you create #ask in #ask
[13:29:14] <decx> and then you do it again
[13:29:16] <anternat> hello ,i am working on a dynamic drop down menu on this link : http://phppot.com/jquery/jquery-dependent-dropdown-list-countries-and-states/. How do i modify it so that state appears AFTER the country is selected.(My dropdown menu is 3 level)
[13:29:17] <decx> world of hurt
[13:29:17] <robertmaxrees> skip the ajax call and just do the success method.
[13:29:43] <decx> anternat: if you want an autocomplete use autocomplete and not select2 ;)
[13:30:03] <taplar> game0: also if it's an array, use either forEach() or $.each instead of $().each()
[13:30:21] <anternat> decx>> i do not need a.complete,iwant it to be like this: http://demos.99points.info/ajax_dropdown/
[13:30:38] <anternat> robertmaxrees>> were you referring to me?
[13:30:47] <robertmaxrees> anternat nope.  was talking to somebody else.
[13:30:55] <anternat> okay
[13:31:22] <robertmaxrees> anternat uh, so you want it to be like the second link?  why not start there?
[13:32:11] <anternat> robertmaxrees>> already finished coding including php+mysql parts,the easiest choice by now would be to modify the current one  :/
[13:32:22] <anternat> wish i  found the second link earlier
[13:32:33] <decx> i dont get it
[13:32:36] <decx> use typeahead?
[13:32:38] <decx> instead of select2
[13:32:46] <decx> no changes to your backend required
[13:33:08] <decx> wait you have another link now ^^
[13:33:32] <decx> oh i see
[13:33:36] <anternat> okay
[13:33:45] <decx> somebody else had the same kind of issue earlier
[13:33:50] <decx> and repeated again and again
[13:33:57] <decx> i thought you were them sorry ^^
[13:34:01] <anternat> i was thinking a lil modification would give me what i want,am i right?
[13:34:07] <game0> https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/tp2n8br5/
[13:34:27] <game0> but I don't know how to add the json to this
[13:34:43] <anternat> it might have been me decx :D but this is my fist time in the channel
[13:34:45] <taplar> just stick it in some where, heck even in the css area
[13:34:46] <robertmaxrees> game0 skip the ajax part and just use the data directly instead.
[13:34:53] <game0> http://pastebin.com/2zaAMyPe
[13:35:05] <helvetet> anyone here who understands internet explorer's privacy settings? if its on high and my cookie contains some json stuff it gets blocked by ie, but cookies with just a true/false value doesn't
[13:35:13] <decx> anternat: no i had to check it and it was somebody else, similar request with dropdown but completely different
[13:35:16] <robertmaxrees> also, don't do $(data.questions).  you want data.questions.forEach()
[13:35:35] <taplar> oh!
[13:35:37] <anternat> okay decx :)
[13:35:37] <taplar> hah
[13:35:40] <taplar> he's using html()
[13:35:42] <taplar> not appending
[13:35:58] <decx> also #ask in #ask
[13:36:14] <robertmaxrees> game0 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tp2n8br5/1/
[13:36:18] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, you're using .html
[13:36:26] <robertmaxrees> you want to append instead.
[13:36:49] <decx> yeah but #ask yourself if you would put #ask in #ask
[13:36:55] <taplar> wtf
[13:37:01] <robertmaxrees> hahaha what are you even talking about decx?
[13:37:03] <taplar> decx is stuck in a loop, someone help
[13:37:09] <anternat> :)
[13:37:12] <decx> are you not seeing this
[13:37:20] <robertmaxrees> seeign what?
[13:37:22] <decx> #ask.html(<div id=ask)
[13:37:27] <taplar> nope
[13:37:33] <taplar> well, only just then
[13:37:50] <robertmaxrees> oooh.
[13:37:52] <robertmaxrees> i see what you mean.
[13:38:08] <robertmaxrees> game0 you're appending a div with the same ID as the element you're targeting.
[13:38:11] <taplar> ah
[13:38:15] <robertmaxrees> can't repeat an ID on a page.
[13:38:17] <decx> HA!
[13:38:28] <taplar> i didn't know what you were going on about, lol
[13:38:55] <taplar> at first i thought you were trying to tell someone about another channel
[13:39:00] <decx> that's on my business card "no idea what he's going on about but he's probably right"
[13:41:29] <taplar> mine says "registered up man"
[13:41:31] <game0> ok, robertmatmaxrees I didn't get your point exactly
[13:41:43] <taplar> then they go "what'san up man"
[13:41:58] * taplar abandons the joke
[13:42:35] <decx> an id is supposed to be unique
[13:42:43] <decx> you know like in the name: identifier
[13:42:51] <robertmaxrees> game0 there were a few - you were using the wrong each, you were appending an element to another but they were both using the same ID, and you were using .html(), which was replacing the same element over and over.
[13:43:05] <arup_r> How should I add this http://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/ in JS fiddle to play something
[13:43:06] <arup_r> ?
[13:43:26] <robertmaxrees> use https://github.com/LeaVerou/awesomplete with rawgit.
[13:44:11] <arup_r> ok
[13:44:25] <arup_r> where you saw it? :)
[13:44:32] <robertmaxrees> saw what?  the github link?
[13:44:37] <arup_r> ohh
[13:47:29] <arup_r> is it possible to open the dropdown when user will start typing into ti? https://select2.github.io/examples.html#multiple right now on focus it opens u
[13:47:33] <arup_r> up*
[13:49:47] <game0> yes, I got you robertmaxrees, then I want to add correct sign or wrong sign after the question once the user press on submit
[13:49:54] <game0> how can I do that ?
[13:49:57] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:50:01] <robertmaxrees> fix the other three issues first.
[13:50:04] <robertmaxrees> then go there :)
[13:50:30] <game0> yes, I've made something like this .before
[13:51:24] <game0> I've had the submit button with id submit, so I've add $('#submit').before()
[13:51:34] <game0> then do write the questions
[13:51:38] <arup_r> is it possible ?
[13:51:39] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with the errors you need to fix....
[13:51:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:51:54] <robertmaxrees> arup_r why change it?  jsut curious.
[13:52:16] <game0> I'm very beginner with jquery
[13:52:45] <robertmaxrees> game0 okay?  i'm really confused.  you need to fix those three things i pointed out above.
[13:53:45] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: Actually, I found this helpful http://jsfiddle.net/XQ8Fw/ .. I will have a dropdown where I want to add values from dropdown as well as new items(emails). but now say I have 300 users on focus it will display all 300 ..
[13:54:00] <arup_r> I want it to show when I start typing..
[13:54:05] <robertmaxrees> arup_r slow down.
[13:54:11] <arup_r> ok
[13:54:13] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to reduce the amount of network requests?
[13:54:53] <arup_r> yes, and I don't want to do Ajax call.. I will have all data(options) loaded on page load..
[13:54:59] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:55:00] <robertmaxrees> what?
[13:55:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm really lost lol
[13:55:08] <arup_r> ok..:)
[13:55:54] <arup_r> I want to have a dropdown with preloaded values.. and now I want to search there.. and if I found the serach, I will add it.. and if not found I can add it also to dropdown
[13:56:20] <robertmaxrees> but why not just show the dropdown on focus?  don't understand why that's a concern.
[13:56:41] <arup_r> ok, so if have 300 emails, it will be a long list.
[13:56:47] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:57:13] <robertmaxrees> that's why you have that search box.
[14:01:01] <robertmaxrees> game0 fwiw we told you exactly what ##javascript told you ;)
[14:01:11] <game0> OK, robertmaxrees I've changed the .html to .append and it worked
[14:01:21] <taplar> who'd a thunk
[14:01:22] <robertmaxrees> i know ;) you also have other issues you need to fix.
[14:01:28] <arup_r> hmm. now the problem is I don't to do Ajax. And searching can't be done on select input element, but on input element.. so how would I add the data source ?
[14:01:49] <robertmaxrees> arup_r you wnat to use ajax for select2?
[14:02:02] <robertmaxrees> https://select2.github.io/examples.html#data-ajax
[14:02:20] <arup_r> no.. I want the data to loaded on page load. not ajax..
[14:02:34] <robertmaxrees> then don't do ajax.
[14:02:40] <robertmaxrees> loat it on pageload.
[14:02:43] <robertmaxrees> *load
[14:02:45] <houlihan> Hey all, I'm kind of new to this and I'm trying to get a thing to work. Can somebody please tell me where I'm going wrong?
[14:02:46] <houlihan> https://jsfiddle.net/sxn16Lu1/
[14:03:03] <robertmaxrees> houlihan you don't have jquery included on your fiddle :)
[14:03:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sxn16Lu1/1/
[14:03:28] <robertmaxrees> if you click the gear icon in the javascript box you see a "libraries and frameworks" dropdown :)
[14:03:47] <houlihan> The idea is that you pick the div in the first select box, then pick a gray shade from the second one and it changes the relevant div's color
[14:03:58] <houlihan> Ah OK
[14:04:18] <robertmaxrees> the second issue is scoping and how you use vars.
[14:04:29] <robertmaxrees> var selectedDiv = $("#selectDiv").val() that var only exists in that first change function.
[14:04:34] <Uhkis> third issue is quoting the variable which makes it just a string
[14:04:50] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis yeah, that's what I meant by "how you use vars"
[14:05:05] <houlihan> OK I just picked JQuery 2.2.0
[14:05:08] <robertmaxrees> houlihan you can't access that var outside of that function unless you move the declaration up to a higher scope.
[14:05:30] <houlihan> Aha! OK let me fix that
[14:05:31] <houlihan> Thanks
[14:05:35] <robertmaxrees> also, $("selectedDiv") isn't what you want - "selectedDiv" is a string.
[14:05:42] <robertmaxrees> you're literally searching for <selectedDiv> with that.
[14:05:47] <robertmaxrees> yopu want $('#' + selectedDiv);
[14:05:49] <Uhkis> and please use the tidy button up there ;)
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> 'selectedColor' is similar - you're using that literal value.  you want selectedColor without quotes.
[14:06:15] <houlihan> https://jsfiddle.net/sxn16Lu1/2/
[14:06:58] <robertmaxrees> of you'r eincluding the # in your values.
[14:07:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not the right way to do that...
[14:07:28] <game0> robertmaxrees, the json file is like sample from another system
[14:07:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sxn16Lu1/5/
[14:07:39] <game0> your talking about the json file
[14:07:42] <game0> is the problem
[14:07:50] <robertmaxrees> game0 i mean your js code.
[14:07:52] <robertmaxrees> not the json file.
[14:08:15] <game0> what is the other problem, please :)
[14:08:20] <robertmaxrees> i listed them earlier.
[14:08:24] <robertmaxrees> houlihan https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sxn16Lu1/7/ this is what you want.
[14:08:33] <robertmaxrees> game0 you were replicating an ID on the page.
[14:09:09] <robertmaxrees> and you can't do $(yourData).each()
[14:09:16] <decx> dejavue?
[14:09:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to use either yourData.forEach() or $.each(yourData, function() {});
[14:09:24] <game0> ok yes, I've changed the id
[14:09:34] <robertmaxrees> i already explained all of that a few times :)
[14:09:37] <game0> from ask tp askme
[14:09:40] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the disconnect is at this point.
[14:09:48] <robertmaxrees> game0 except that's still nto valid.
[14:09:53] <robertmaxrees> because you're appending multiple items.
[14:09:57] <robertmaxrees> they can't all share the same ID.
[14:10:20] <houlihan> https://jsfiddle.net/sxn16Lu1/9/
[14:10:34] <houlihan> I seem to be missing something here
[14:10:36] <robertmaxrees> houlihan i have you exactly what you want.
[14:10:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sxn16Lu1/7/
[14:10:44] <robertmaxrees> compare.
[14:11:12] <robertmaxrees> $(selectedDiv).css('background-color', 'selectedColor'); doesn't make sense.  you don't want selectedColor the string, you want its value.
[14:11:20] <robertmaxrees> also you want to declare the var higher up.
[14:11:33] <robertmaxrees> am i not explaining things well today?  nobody is reading what i have to say.
[14:11:46] <taplar> :)
[14:12:26] <Uhkis> in a perfect world it would be you
[14:12:35] <robertmaxrees> after my experience last night it just sort of makes me want to stop doing this.
[14:12:43] <taplar> what happened?
[14:12:53] <taplar> err, i can read logs
[14:13:07] <robertmaxrees> somebody just had some really choice words for me and was being pretty rude.
[14:13:19] <decx> we need an idiocrazy mashup from the hospital scene with different design patterns on the buttons
[14:13:22] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:13:33] * NoiseEee takes robertmaxrees for some beer and semi-legal canadian grass
[14:13:48] <robertmaxrees> hah, i actually don't smoke anything but cigars.  thanks though ;)
[14:14:02] <NoiseEee> i'll get ya some cubans then
[14:14:12] <NoiseEee> wait, can you americanos finally buy cuban cigars now
[14:14:13] <game0> robertmaxrees, thanks dude
[14:14:13] <NoiseEee> ?
[14:14:20] <game0> http://pastebin.com/u7UN47BW
[14:14:36] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee not online yet.  we can bring back up $100 of cubanos.
[14:14:51] <robertmaxrees> which is like 3 cigars.
[14:15:01] <robertmaxrees> game0 still not goo.
[14:15:07] <NoiseEee> heh... but you can travel/go on vaction to cuba now right robertmaxrees?
[14:15:09] <robertmaxrees> <div id=\"ask\"></div>correct<br><br>"); - you're appending this div multiple times.
[14:15:23] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee haha i wish.  i'm actually doing a 2 week trip to europe this summer.
[14:15:28] <taplar> game0: if you surround the strings with '' instead of "" you can avoid the escaping
[14:15:33] <game0> yes, just testing
[14:15:34] <taplar> fwiw
[14:15:36] <NoiseEee> robertmaxrees: well thats awesome
[14:15:52] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee yeah very.  after 2015 and the start of this year i need a break.
[14:16:08] <game0> how can I make that once the user press on the submit it should show either correct or wrong sign
[14:17:02] <game0> I'm not getting the idea of that
[14:17:17] <robertmaxrees> game0 you still need to fix the duplicated IDs.
[14:17:19] <taplar> fix your id issue first
[14:17:35] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: where in europe?
[14:17:58] <Uhkis> those logs were pretty funny btw, "i dont have the time to read the docs, do it for me" :D
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis we're going to paris and Florence/Rome/a few other spots in italy.
[14:18:05] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis hahahaha yeah....
[14:19:19] <Uhkis> lets hope france is more stable when your trip is due
[14:19:51] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis absolutely.  i think it'd be good for me to gain some perspective on what it's like over there right now.
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> i've been overseas twice so far.  each time i learn a LOT about other cultures and it really helps me gain perspective on things.
[14:20:53] <Uhkis> you should come to finland. in january! :D
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha.  i actually need to go to sweden some day.  lots of family history there.
[14:21:50] <taplar> taplar wrote this > var CustomAdapter = Utils.Decorate; {
[14:21:50] <Uhkis> so you might actually survive!
[14:21:52] <taplar> huh?
[14:22:20] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis i LOVE the cold.  I did march in prague/berlin and LOVED it.
[14:22:32] <robertmaxrees> taplar heh yep.  i asked them to not drag other people into that conversation.
[14:23:25] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: that sounds like +10ish
[14:23:30] <Uhkis> celcius that is
[14:23:47] <robertmaxrees> it was colder than that.  prague snowed a little.
[14:23:59] <robertmaxrees> it gets down into the teens where i live.
[14:24:57] <NoiseEee> its going to be -20C this weekend here in Toronto, its been warm all winter though
[14:25:14] <Uhkis> http://www.radionova.fi/mediabank/image/54057_article.jpg ill just leave this here :D
[14:26:45] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee we've been loving the weather this winter.  finally getting a little water!
[14:27:04] <jancoow> Hi. I have a table with 2 columns and in both of these columns i have a <select>. When the <select> in the first collumn calls a method with onchange , it has to do something with the <select> in the second column. How can i reach this one? Can i do this iwth the next() statement?
[14:27:22] <robertmaxrees> jancoow we'd need to see the HTML, but probably not.
[14:27:31] <decx> precache both if it's just the 2
[14:27:31] <Uhkis> NoiseEee: that can be called cold :)
[14:27:31] <robertmaxrees> you'll want a combination of .closest() and .find() i'm guessing.
[14:27:42] <robertmaxrees> otherwice, precache and give them unique IDs or classes.
[14:28:15] <jancoow> yeah, i wanted to look for another solution of giving it a class name, because the rows can be added dynamicly!
[14:28:35] <jancoow> so i was curious if it could be done with a next() statement or something, will send you some html
[14:29:32] <jancoow> https://jancokock.me/f/aff7c
[14:29:48] <robertmaxrees> you could still use a class for each one.  if they're both in the same TR, you can .closest('tr') and then .find('someClassName')
[14:30:05] <robertmaxrees> also, you don't wnat onchange.
[14:30:08] <robertmaxrees> use .on()
[14:30:17] <jancoow> why?
[14:30:32] <robertmaxrees> html is a bad place for logic.
[14:30:38] <NoiseEee> Uhkis: way too cold!
[14:30:44] <robertmaxrees> js files exist because that's where you should put your JS.
[14:31:26] <jancoow> yeah, some controller - view
[14:31:36] <Uhkis> NoiseEee: that -27 week we had in january was too cold! :D
[14:31:37] <robertmaxrees> or just in your JS files ;)
[14:35:51] <game000> https://jsfiddle.net/r01msxhj/
[14:36:41] <robertmaxrees> still not what you want :)
[14:36:42] <jancoow> robertmaxrees: thanks, your solution works :)
[14:36:47] <jancoow> thanks for the help
[14:36:55] <robertmaxrees> game000 you're appending the same ID multiple times.
[14:37:04] <robertmaxrees> jancoow definitely :)
[14:37:47] <robertmaxrees> game000 you see the <div id=\"ask\"></div>correct<br><br>");?  you're appenmding that html to the page multiple times.
[14:38:07] <game000> ok, ok I got it
[14:39:36] <decx> i believe it when i see it
[14:41:27] <decx> also you never close your label
[14:41:43] <decx> guess what that shit is hard to see when you create html with a string
[14:42:21] <taplar> heh, so lots of empty labels
[14:43:33] <taplar> the first label also has an id on it
[14:43:39] <houlihan> Hey robertmaxrees, thanks for the help
[14:43:53] <robertmaxrees> houlihan yeah definitely :)
[14:43:54] <robertmaxrees> any time.
[14:44:29] <Nargooz> j #javascript
[14:47:29] <game000> ok, now it's good I think https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/3amodLvr/
[14:48:12] <taplar> any reason your not using a class?
[14:48:55] <arup_r> I am getting error as "Error: No select2/compat/inputData" ...but why? https://jsfiddle.net/nq0L98xr/4/
[14:49:49] <game000> robertmaxrees, I've changed the code and id
[14:49:56] <duch_kazatel> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/select2/yifYbU1HPOY arup_r
[14:50:13] <robertmaxrees> arup_r quick google search tells you.
[14:50:42] <arup_r> my quick search gives https://www.google.co.in/search?q=yahoo&oq=yah&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60l3j69i57.758j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8 which is not relevant
[14:51:00] <robertmaxrees> arup_r huh?
[14:51:00] <arup_r> opps sorry
[14:51:11] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=No+select2%2Fcompat%2FinputData&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 this is all you need.
[14:51:12] <arup_r> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30235909/using-select2-get-error-error-no-select2-compat-query
[14:51:37] <robertmaxrees> that's not the same error.
[14:51:57] <robertmaxrees> "Support for `<input />` tags is only available in the full builds of Select2. You should be using "select2.full.js" and we should be providing a better error message about it."
[14:52:01] <robertmaxrees> from the link i tossed out.
[14:53:48] <arup_r> hmm
[14:53:59] <robertmaxrees> so use the full file for select2 :)
[14:54:10] <decx> there you are
[14:54:18] <decx> scrap select2 and use any autocomplete
[14:54:24] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:54:25] <decx> it's not a select
[14:54:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah i don't really understand why you insist on select2 for an autocomplete.  everything you've been asking for so far is exactly what an autocomplete does.
[15:01:49] <arup_r> its ok, I removed select2. I now picked up http://arendjr.github.io/selectivity/#example-2 it is ok, but no idea how to add the value which is not found in the dropdown while searching..
[15:02:26] <robertmaxrees> arup_r could you clarify what exactly you're trying to accomplish with this UI?
[15:02:34] <robertmaxrees> becuase you just traded one plugin for another that does the same thing.
[15:02:43] <arup_r> I said.. again sayin.. np
[15:03:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:03:41] <arup_r> I will be having a dropdown, or anything like that. With the input field I will search emails, if I find it I will select it, and if not find, then also want to add it..
[15:03:51] <arup_r> most plugin does either one.. not both :(
[15:04:03] <robertmaxrees> but is for one email at a time, right?
[15:05:10] <arup_r> yes..
[15:05:15] <robertmaxrees> so why do you need the tagging thing?
[15:05:26] <arup_r> toggling means ?
[15:05:49] <robertmaxrees> tagging - as in, you enter something and it fills the box with a little tag of that result.
[15:06:27] <arup_r> ok, because the dropdown has to be multiselect..
[15:06:54] <arup_r> I would like to select more than one emails.. it is a kind of invitee..
[15:07:28] <arup_r> Like we have in Google calender
[15:07:53] <arup_r> you can add as invitee both google users as well as outside of google users
[15:09:17] <decx> typeahead and jquery autocomplete let you extend your dataset with arbitrary data, so you can ajax in your dataset and then add whatever you a writing as another option
[15:10:45] <decx> like you ajax in a json, map your values into an array and then just push this.value in there
[15:11:01] <decx> if that's what you're up to ^^
[15:11:23] <robertmaxrees> or don't ajax them and just init them that way.
[15:11:32] <decx> right
[15:12:51] <decx> most likely works with select2 too
[15:13:02] <decx> pretty agnostic approach
[15:14:36] <arup_r> I didn't get,, can select handle what I said? I am not seeing though
[15:15:24] <robertmaxrees> select2 shouldn't be adding values that you don't want.
[15:16:38] <arup_r> Then what plugin I should use to do what I want?
[15:16:56] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don't understand how what you want is different from select2 lol
[15:18:53] <arup_r> ok. Say, my dropdown has 3 values {a@email.com, b@email.com, c@email.com} .. now I am searching dude@email.com .. so what will be the search result? no data. In this case, I want to add the email to the dropdown also.. and if the email found, then also I want to add
[15:19:05] <arup_r> kind of adding system internal and external users
[15:19:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:19:59] <hellyeah> hey there
[15:20:07] <robertmaxrees> ooooh.
[15:20:22] <robertmaxrees> so you want to add the value to the dropdown list AND add it to the list of valid entries.
[15:20:34] <decx> i looked back at the first fiddle you posted http://jsfiddle.net/sherbrow/bwdmm/2/ so the only problem is that it opens on focus instead of input?
[15:20:45] <decx> wait
[15:20:48] <decx> wrong fiddle ha ^^
[15:21:12] <decx> this one http://jsfiddle.net/XQ8Fw/
[15:21:35] <freezevee> how can I attach a variable to the DOM ?
[15:21:57] <freezevee> I need to use it in Rails actually and I have no other way than "hide' a variable in the html
[15:22:01] <robertmaxrees> freezevee... huh?
[15:22:05] <freezevee> it's a simple integer
[15:22:08] <robertmaxrees> you don't "attach a variable to the DOM"
[15:22:13] <freezevee> hide ?
[15:22:16] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do?  pass a value in a form?
[15:22:19] <hellyeah> element
[15:22:21] <arup_r> decx: yes, that is the only problem.
[15:22:41] <freezevee> robertmaxrees: attach to the window element ?
[15:22:54] <robertmaxrees> freezevee that's all global vars, but rails won't see that inherently.
[15:22:57] <arup_r> but now new select2 stopped supporting to work with input element. It works with only dropdown
[15:23:00] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to actually do?
[15:23:17] <arup_r> me ?
[15:23:21] <robertmaxrees> no, freezevee
[15:23:24] <arup_r> ok
[15:23:44] <freezevee> robertmaxrees: any other ideas ?
[15:23:51] <robertmaxrees> freezevee your question doesn't make sense.
[15:24:01] <robertmaxrees> which is why i'm asking what you're actually trying toi do.
[15:24:03] <robertmaxrees> *to
[15:24:04] <freezevee> I want to take the id from the url e.g. /user/2
[15:24:04] <hellyeah> hey when you create two elements, change event wont be fired in first element. Why is that? http://jsfiddle.net/rsw4z8tw/6/
[15:24:16] <decx> freezevee: use data-* attributes
[15:24:42] <freezevee> decx: but I must have an html dom element right ?
[15:24:51] <robertmaxrees> freezevee yes.  what are youa ctually trying to do?
[15:25:00] <robertmaxrees> explain why you think you need to "attach a variable to the DOM"
[15:25:22] <decx> let's say you have a list of users and want to use some path or value that is relevant for your js, just add a data attribute
[15:26:43] <freezevee> robertmaxrees: get the variable by jquery to pass it to a channel for websockets
[15:26:47] <hellyeah> data-* is flexible
[15:27:00] <robertmaxrees> freezevee yeah, use a data attribute.  otherwise, just pull it from your URL or whatever.
[15:27:03] <hellyeah> freezevee: keep it in data attribute
[15:27:18] <freezevee> hellyeah: how should I use it ?
[15:27:26] <robertmaxrees> freezevee you attach it to a node.
[15:27:33] <freezevee> hellyeah: I mean do I simply set an html tag ?
[15:27:37] <robertmaxrees> data-somename="avalue"
[15:27:40] <robertmaxrees> on an html tag.
[15:27:43] <hellyeah> .attr()
[15:27:44] <freezevee> ok got it
[15:27:46] <robertmaxrees> .data
[15:27:49] <robertmaxrees> not .attr()
[15:27:53] <freezevee> thank you guys
[15:27:53] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[15:27:55] <robertmaxrees> use use .data() to then get the value.
[15:28:14] <taplar> hellyeah: what change are you talking about?
[15:28:48] <hellyeah> freezevee:   https://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:29:02] <hellyeah> taplar: i just shortened fiddle :D
[15:29:53] <hellyeah> when you create two element in one time first one become useless
[15:30:13] <taplar> where in the code
[15:31:11] <hellyeah> well the things i changed i added element to the body
[15:31:34] <taplar> please update your fiddle, share it, and tell me a line number, :/
[15:31:45] <hellyeah> i called that function createANewDatepickerSection() in line 130
[15:32:31] <taplar> so your calling that every time you click the new button?
[15:33:08] <hellyeah> yes
[15:33:12] <hellyeah> + button
[15:33:22] <taplar> $('.updateButton').on('click', function() {
[15:33:27] <taplar> what is that doing?
[15:33:34] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:33:51] <hellyeah> when you create fdatepickers and select the dates
[15:33:58] <hellyeah> the below calendar is colorized
[15:34:04] <taplar> what is that line doing
[15:34:27] <hellyeah> it is not working correctly i try to remove dates colorized in below calendar
[15:34:45] <hellyeah> each datepickers have updateButton
[15:34:47] <taplar> i'm going to repeat my question, :)
[15:35:26] <hellyeah> that line binds click event to updateButton is that what you asked?
[15:35:31] <taplar> which ones?
[15:36:31] <hellyeah> line 97
[15:36:38] <taplar> no, which update buttons?
[15:36:47] <freezevee> hellyeah: isn't it how you get it var device = $(this).attr("data-device"); ?
[15:36:49] <hellyeah> all updateButton is functional
[15:36:56] <taplar> ok
[15:36:59] <taplar> and when do you do that?
[15:37:14] <freezevee> hellyeah: do I need var device = $(this).attr("data-device").val() ;
[15:37:18] <hellyeah> freezevee: you should read this https://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:37:55] <hellyeah> taplar: let say you create datepickers and select two dates then inputboxers is disabled and updateButton showed up
[15:38:08] <hellyeah> taplar: then updateButton is functional
[15:38:18] <taplar> i know when it's executing.  i'm asking you to make you read/think about the logic
[15:38:36] <hellyeah> freezevee: you should define something to your data attribute
[15:38:45] <hellyeah> val() is using for getting value of element
[15:38:52] <hellyeah> if i am not mistaken
[15:38:56] <freezevee> hellyeah:  I did a <div data-device="2"></div>
[15:39:04] <freezevee> but I see undefined on the console
[15:39:49] <taplar> attributes don't have values
[15:39:49] <hellyeah> freezevee: ryou should read link
[15:39:51] <taplar> they are values
[15:39:54] <hellyeah> and fiddle it
[15:40:05] <hellyeah> then people can help you more
[15:40:13] <hellyeah> jsfiddle.net
[15:41:00] <hellyeah> taplar: well when you click updateButton it gets the value of spesific dates from datepickers
[15:41:04] <adis> imal ko iz Bosne za razgovor?
[15:41:15] <taplar> i'm not talking about what that handler is doing
[15:41:16] <hellyeah> is that what you asked?
[15:41:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:41:26] <taplar> i'm talking about what it is binding to and how often that binding happens
[15:42:23] <hellyeah> when user think to change dates after assigining some dates
[15:42:38] <hellyeah> i mean they made mistake and want to change it
[15:42:42] <hellyeah> it can happen anytime
[15:42:49] <taplar> disregard that
[15:43:00] <taplar> how many times should you bind an event handler to a given element?
[15:43:09] <hellyeah> well
[15:43:23] <hellyeah> everytime dates are choosen
[15:43:27] <hellyeah> chosen*
[15:43:27] <taplar> y?
[15:43:45] <hellyeah> yoh
[15:43:47] <taplar> what's the point of a single element having the same binding multiple times?
[15:43:48] <hellyeah> sorry
[15:44:03] <hellyeah> when you create element updatebutton is also created
[15:44:08] <taplar> a new one
[15:44:15] <hellyeah> new one i mean
[15:44:19] <taplar> your selecting ALL of them and binding on ALL OF THEM
[15:44:30] <hellyeah> taplar: they can want to change the dates more then once
[15:44:42] <hellyeah> global lookup?
[15:44:45] <taplar> yep
[15:44:50] <hellyeah> not again
[15:44:53] <hellyeah> :/
[15:44:54] <taplar> oh yeah
[15:45:01] <taplar> multiple places
[15:45:13] <taplar> also
[15:45:16] <taplar> $('.this')
[15:45:19] <taplar> what the heck is that?
[15:45:31] <hellyeah> which line?
[15:45:41] <taplar> 113
[15:47:40] <hellyeah> taplar: i have this ine 113 $('.updateButton').attr('disabled',false);
[15:48:13] <taplar> i'm looking at /10.  you never gave me an updated fiddle
[15:48:37] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[15:49:21] <hellyeah> did you mean this  $('.this').attr('disabled', true);
[15:49:25] <taplar> yep
[15:50:26] <taplar> your also doing $(this).closest('.datePicker') all over the place
[15:50:30] <taplar> cache man
[15:50:58] <arc_> doing that also makes it easier to read
[15:50:58] <hellyeah> well
[15:51:44] <hellyeah> taplar: actually right now i am not sure that line make sense
[15:51:55] <taplar> the $('.this') line?
[15:52:02] <hellyeah> yes
[15:52:10] <taplar> i completely agree
[15:52:11] <hellyeah> i plan to disable updateButton
[15:52:17] <hellyeah> if two dates are not selected
[15:52:20] <taplar> a class of 'this' tells you nothing about it
[15:53:00] <hellyeah> it is totally waste :X
[15:53:03] <taplar> but anyway, start working on fixing your global lookups and then reduce your redundant lookups
[15:53:24] <taplar> *redundant wrappers and lookups
[15:54:01] <game000> guys, I want to my code the correct sign after every question how?
[15:54:25] <game000> https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/3amodLvr/
[15:54:29] <game000> this is my code
[15:54:29] <taplar> game000: can you repeat that question?
[15:54:39] <hellyeah> taplar: i removed if http://jsfiddle.net/rsw4z8tw/11/
[15:54:43] <hellyeah> ops else
[15:55:40] <game000> I want once the user press the check answer button it should show either correct sign or wrong sign after all questions
[15:56:01] <game000> how?
[15:56:09] <taplar> 'correct sign' ?
[15:56:28] <game000> let's say correct word for now
[15:56:55] <taplar> k, easiest way would be to put a span or something in there some where with a class on it.  then when you need to set it, target that class and set the html() of it
[15:57:18] <game000> give me 5 min, I'm going to toilet
[15:57:22] <game000> sorry
[15:57:28] <taplar> shit happens
[15:58:44] <ckb> hey fellas, can I trigger a click on an element in an iframe?
[15:58:56] <taplar> you can if it's the same domain
[15:59:21] <ckb> then how do native clicks in an iframe work?
[15:59:34] <taplar> you clicking vs javascript clicking are different
[15:59:47] <ckb> I'll get XSS errors?
[16:00:07] <taplar> yep
[16:01:04] <ckb> Essentially, I'm trying to add a join group button for Facebook... best way would be to potentially shrink the iframe / scroll to button?
[16:01:25] <taplar> no clue
[16:01:34] <taplar> FB may have something in one of their APIs?
[16:01:41] <ckb> but the clicking definitely won't work?
[16:01:44] <ckb> Unfortunately, not.
[16:01:52] <taplar> no, you can't click across domains
[16:02:06] <taplar> programatically
[16:02:13] <ckb> I guess that makes sense due to advertising issues (leads, etc)
[16:02:28] <taplar> imagine a website opening a hidden iframe to gmail
[16:02:29] <ckb> thanks for the advice, tap
[16:02:33] <taplar> clicking delete all
[16:02:56] <taplar> how many people are always logged into gmail?
[16:02:57] <taplar> :)
[16:04:16] <hellyeah> taplar: is it better http://jsfiddle.net/rsw4z8tw/12/
[16:05:40] <decx> wow only 138 lines, that's downright minimalistic for your standards
[16:05:42] <taplar> tidy your code dude.  also you declared it as $closest but your referencing closest
[16:06:17] <taplar> take your time.  this isn't a race for updates
[16:07:07] <taplar> also, $closest.  could that be named better?
[16:07:18] <taplar> what is it?
[16:07:24] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:07:29] <hellyeah> closest datepickers
[16:07:42] <ckb> taplar: unfortunately Facebook iframe aren't allowed
[16:07:44] <hellyeah> taplar: this is minimal functionality.
[16:07:58] <taplar> get in the habit of naming your variables what they are
[16:08:00] <hellyeah> taplar: i got closest datepickersç
[16:08:06] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:08:16] <hellyeah> like closestDatePickers ?
[16:08:20] <taplar> sure
[16:09:02] <taplar> if you can read the  variable and you know what it is, win
[16:10:57] <hellyeah> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/rsw4z8tw/14/
[16:11:39] <taplar> alright, keep going
[16:12:19] <hellyeah> are you gone?
[16:12:23] <hellyeah> :p
[16:12:29] <taplar_busy> i'm observing.  but i may not reply
[16:13:58] <taplar_busy> just remember, don't rush it.  name your variables what they are.  if your doing a global lookup, make sure you need to be doing that.  keep that in mind as you refactor what you have
[16:14:24] <taplar_busy> + cache and reuse things you do repeatedly
[16:15:30] <hellyeah> fixed errors
[16:15:57] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/rsw4z8tw/15/

[17:24:42] <Gasher> Hello. How can I access the information of which site is currently opened? Like reading from the link, so example.com/tools, example.com/about -- the tools and about part.
[17:28:12] <stan_man_can> I have a table, the rows alternate classes parent/child. I need to allow drag/drop to re-order the rows, but you can only drag/drop a tr with "parent", and it has to bring the following "child" with it. Possible with jquery ui drag/drop?
[17:28:48] <taplar_busy> iirc, jquery ui draggable does not work with tables
[17:28:58] <taplar_busy> <table>'s that is
[17:30:29] <stan_man_can> taplar_busy: it would be more sortable than dragggable
[17:30:39] <taplar_busy> same thing
[17:31:01] <taplar_busy> <table>'s have strong relations between their elements as opposed to other html elements
[17:31:19] <taplar_busy> ah, wait
[17:31:24] <taplar_busy> u said sortable
[17:32:21] <taplar_busy> honestly i'm not sure
[17:32:29] <taplar_busy> i have the feeling it would be the same issue
[17:32:32] <stan_man_can> taplar_busy: I can do the sortable easy enough
[17:32:38] <stan_man_can> it's bringing the following row with it that's an issue
[18:32:25] <huck5> I am having an incredibly hard time replacing a jQuery UI (mobile) textinput with another element...
[18:33:05] <huck5> I want to destory a textinput, then call .replaceWith on it, and pass in a new element (a selectmenu, but I'm having trouble replacing it with any element)
[18:37:33] <taplar> fiddle?
[18:39:42] <arc_> can you chain anything more after destroy
[18:39:54] <arc_> doesn't that remove the node you're trying to replaceWith
[18:40:01] <arc_> i don't get why you need to destroy it if you're replacing it
[18:42:45] <huck5> arc_, perhaps I don't.. I'll get a fiddle, one moment :)
[18:45:15] <huck5> arc_, something like this... https://jsfiddle.net/h00w0uuz/
[18:46:05] <huck5> Is basically what is happening. The text-input gets the jQuery UI style removed.. but doesn't actually get replaced by the new element... It just seems to remove the input's containing-div?
[18:46:08] <taplar> i don't see a destroy in there
[18:46:26] <huck5> that's without the destroy, sorry. I omitted it because it was not changing the behaviour
[18:48:19] <huck5> taplar, here is an update, with the destroy (and a button to initaite the attempted change) https://jsfiddle.net/h00w0uuz/1/
[18:51:23] <taplar> looks like it is replacing it, course the type isn't being put on it
[18:51:40] <huck5> Hm..
[18:52:19] <huck5> But if I try the same thing with "<select/>" (with some added options), the exact same thing happens. I'm not really convinced it's replacing anything..
[18:53:04] <huck5> I've also tried this by replacing the parents html with an html string, and calling the $(...).selectmenu() on it.. but the same behavior occurs.
[18:53:08] <taplar> so i guess i'm confused about the issue, as your saying it does replace it  but... ?
[18:53:43] <huck5> taplar, Oh no.. I don't think it is replacing it.
[18:53:54] <taplar> why not?
[18:54:21] <huck5> Because when I inspect the element after the call, the only difference is that the containing div has been removed (The one containing all the jquery ui classes)?
[18:55:24] <huck5> If I alter the id of the newInput so that it does not match that of the original, the id of the original is still present after the function call.
[19:02:32] <taplar> the fiddle is throwing some error: https://jsfiddle.net/h00w0uuz/4/
[19:03:55] <huck5> Hm... and if i bypass the .textinput('destroy') call, another error is thrown on the .replaceWith ...
[19:04:28] <taplar> well i don't see where the textinput is being initialized so that error is possibly with the destroy not knowing what your talking about
[19:04:36] <taplar> in regards to that element
[19:04:44] <huck5> Ah ok, that could make sense.
[19:05:29] <huck5> But if you comment out that 'destroy' line (as it seems unneccessary), the .replaceWith() is still throwing an error...
[19:10:59] <taplar> yeah, not sure.  i'm missing something
[19:11:02] <iLogic> hey i’m using a plugin called lightSlider that you initialize like this: var slider = $(‘element’).lightSlider and can control for exemple slider.stop() .. it works nice for one element, but i’m trying to use it with 3 other elements and if the selector returns more than one when I call a method like stop() it doesn’t exist .. I’m wondering if I could automate the initialization with a loop for each element, but how can I create dynamic vari
[19:11:02] <iLogic> names for each method calling?
[19:11:30] <robertmaxrees> iLogic what's the selector you're using?
[19:12:28] <iLogic> robertmaxrees: for instance $(‘.cards ul’) where there is <div id=“card1” class=“cards”> and <div id=“card2” class=“cards”>
[19:12:42] <huck5> taplar, ok, well I really appreciate you taking the time to have a look!
[19:12:52] <robertmaxrees> you could each through the collection of elements and hit your methods that way i guess iLogic.
[19:12:55] <taplar> huck5: https://jsfiddle.net/h00w0uuz/6/  so that seems to work.  doesn't explain why the other is failing though
[19:13:01] <robertmaxrees> kind of surprised their api doesn't do that for you though.
[19:13:19] <iLogic> robertmaxrees: but how do i declare variables with dynamic names?
[19:13:28] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[19:13:28] <huck5> taplar, brilliant. That gives me something to work with :)
[19:13:31] <robertmaxrees> do an object instead.
[19:13:36] <robertmaxrees> with properties that match.
[19:13:39] <robertmaxrees> or use an array.
[19:14:03] <iLogic> if declare them in an array can i do like arr[‘card1’].stop() ?
[19:14:12] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:14:18] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to filter through it to get the one you want.
[19:14:28] <iLogic> how will i call the methods for each element?
[19:14:36] <taplar> anyway, i'm out. c u peeps tomorrow
[19:14:43] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.  let's step through it iLogic :)
[19:15:07] <iLogic> dude it’s really generic, maybe i’m not explaining myself clearly
[19:15:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:15:33] <robertmaxrees> enjoy then.
[19:16:08] <iLogic> var something = $(‘#id’).plugin() lets me call something.method() .. I wanna do that for each element in a class
[19:16:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm telling you the plugin should be doing that already.
[19:16:32] <robertmaxrees> if it's not, then just use .each()/
[19:16:37] <iLogic> i thought that too
[19:16:38] <robertmaxrees> $('.someClass').each(function() {});
[19:23:01] <masterand> Hello
[19:23:19] <robertmaxrees> iLogic does that make sense?
[19:24:21] <iLogic> robertmaxrees: i’m trying with $(‘.class’).each(function() { $(this).lightSlider() }) and it works to init, but can’t find the object where to call the methods
[19:24:35] <shiftins> hey is this a chan to talk about jquery/globalize ?
[19:24:40] <robertmaxrees> shiftins yep.
[19:25:05] <robertmaxrees> iLogic if you need to call them separately, then you create an object beforehand whose props contain the elements.
[19:25:17] <robertmaxrees> and you do the assignment within that each.
[19:25:20] <shiftins> great, is it a known issue about globalize/plural.js using the (new Function) constructor and incompatiblity with CSP headers ?
[19:25:37] <iLogic> robertmaxrees: i get it
[19:25:47] <robertmaxrees> shiftins sounds like you have a potential bug - i'd head to #jquery-dev and/or check the repo.
[19:26:08] <robertmaxrees> iLogic though afaict you could also just select them by id anyway.
[19:26:15] <robertmaxrees> no need to savew the object it looks like.
[19:27:17] <masterand> I have a jwplayer 6 issue that relates to moving it between html elements
[19:27:38] <robertmaxrees> masterand you're not likely to get much help here for that.
[19:27:51] <masterand> :(
[19:27:55] <iLogic> robertmaxrees: the thing is, when i do var something = $(‘elem’).lightSlide() and console.log(something) it has the method attached to that object .. when it’s more than one selector it doesnt have the methods attached and with .each() i can find the method either
[19:28:23] <robertmaxrees> interesting.,  weird plugin.
[19:28:29] <masterand> I tried JW forums but no luck.
[19:28:36] <robertmaxrees> masterand that doesn't change the topic of this channel :)
[19:28:45] <masterand> Haha ok
[19:29:07] <robertmaxrees> iLogic i thought maybe if you did like $('#element1') or $('.someClass').eq(0) that it would work.
[19:29:10] <robertmaxrees> maybe not though.
[19:29:15] <masterand> It's related to jquery functions
[19:29:25] <robertmaxrees> masterand okay, so then what's your question?
[19:29:39] <iLogic> robertmaxrees: i’m trying to avoid initializing them manually
[19:29:48] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying to init them manually.
[19:30:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying do the init and then access them individually.
[19:30:16] <robertmaxrees> that's why i was asking for a fiddle earlier :) show you what i meant.
[19:31:12] <masterand> Are there parameters/functions etc I can use in conjunction with prepend or append in order to maintain all state info for jwplayer
[19:31:24] <robertmaxrees> masterand not sure i follow, but probably not.
[19:33:05] <masterand> When I move jwplayer around the DOM, depending on the browser, it may maintain it's play state or pause or go to 00:00
[19:33:47] <robertmaxrees> so it's really hard for us to help if we can't see it break, but it's unusual to move a video around like that.  i'm also a little confused about what that has to do with jquery :)
[19:34:24] <masterand> I use append() and prepend()
[19:34:43] <robertmaxrees> right, so the issue is that jwplayer is breaking.
[19:34:53] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/append/
[19:35:01] <masterand> Yes.
[19:35:14] <robertmaxrees> the docs don't have anything in them about maintaining state info for plugins/other libraries.
[19:35:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:36:29] <masterand> Yeah. That's why I'm stumped.
[19:36:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need support from jwplayer.  if somebody here knows, that's cool, but i wouldn't count on it.
[19:48:52] <iLogic> robertmaxrees: i ended up filling a previously created empty object in a each() loop using the index as key and the init method as property.. will try the call the methods now
[19:49:01] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:49:06] <robertmaxrees> don't use the index as a key
[19:49:10] <iLogic> why?
[19:49:15] <robertmaxrees> you want to access them by name, right?
[19:49:32] <iLogic> not really, i can call the methods by mirroring the index() of the elements
[19:49:53] <robertmaxrees> then use an array :)
[19:49:56] <robertmaxrees> not an object.
[19:50:08] <iLogic> i asked if i could do that earlier dude
[19:50:26] <iLogic> if stored in an array can I call the methods from there?
[19:50:32] <robertmaxrees> you then said you wanted to do someObject['someName']
[19:50:36] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that with an array.
[19:50:50] <iLogic> so i cant use an array
[19:51:04] <iLogic> i need to store an object to call methods from
[19:51:10] <robertmaxrees> if you want to use te notation above.
[19:51:59] <iLogic> well it worked with an array
[19:52:04] <iLogic> the same way
[19:52:08] <iLogic> i’ll try to call the methods
[19:53:27] <robertmaxrees> it'll work with an array, but you can't name the properties on an array.
[19:53:28] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[20:15:11] <iLogic> robertmaxrees: worked like a charm :)
[21:05:37] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[22:10:55] <danielyaa5> Hey everybody, I'm having a lot of trouble with jQuery resizable when I resize the width of #v1 there is some weird behavior that happens. https://jsfiddle.net/danielyaa5/6c3ujp1p/
[22:19:00] <taplar_> i think it's a conflict with resizable and flexbox
[22:19:51] <taplar_> if i change the #r1 to style without flex it horizontally adjusts fine: https://jsfiddle.net/6c3ujp1p/1/
[22:30:36] <danielyaa5> taplar: do you know alternative ways to do this?
[22:30:46] <taplar_> i'm still looking at it.
[22:30:53] <taplar_> but i'm just tinkering, :)
[22:33:47] <danielyaa5> taplar_: haha thanks, I can't seem to find other ways of doing this unless i manually create something which sound pretty difficult
[23:14:39] <blindMoe> Anyone here used Footable and had it not response to specific breakpoints?  Even with default settings mine only seems to hide columns on 'tablet' breakpoint but not phone
[23:14:59] <blindMoe> I know it is somewhat of a vague questions but I am looking for someone who has specifically had this issue
[23:20:12] <blindMoe> Just in case anyone ever uses footable and runs into an issue where their custom breakpoints are acting very odd... here is your solution: https://github.com/fooplugins/FooTable/issues/288
[23:25:22] <taplar_> danielyaa5: the more i mess with this the more i'm not sure if this is the best approach
[23:26:23] <taplar_> resizable not only changes the width of an element, but it sets an inline left.  so it's moving and resizing
[23:33:38] <AzMoo> Hello! I have a template I’m trying to load for handlebars and I was wondering if I could do this: <script type=“x-handlebars-template” id=“foo” src=“/path/to/foo.html”></script> <— And then load the contents into a string somehow? I’ve been trying to use .html() and .content() and stuff like that but they’re all empty. How can I get the content?
[23:35:09] <taplar_> AzMoo: is it actually making the src request?
[23:35:34] <AzMoo> taplar_: Yep, I can see the content of it in the Resources section of the Developer Tools
[23:35:54] <taplar_> how are you trying to get the contents?
[23:36:09] <danielyaa5> taplar_: I got something working! I put a resizable table inside the row div. THe only thing is my table wont stretch to the height of the row. Any ideas on whats up? https://jsfiddle.net/danielyaa5/6c3ujp1p/3/
[23:36:34] <AzMoo> taplar_: I’ve been trying to find something on $(“#foo”) that contains them, but can’t see anything. From there I’m out of ideas.
[23:37:00] <taplar_> have you tried $('#foo').text() ?
[23:37:06] <taplar_> or html()?
[23:37:29] <AzMoo> taplar_: Yes, both, they’re both empty strings.
[23:37:47] <taplar_> is that inside any doc ready or anything?
[23:37:56] <AzMoo> Yep, inside a doc ready
[23:38:08] <taplar_> try putting in a document on load
[23:38:15] <taplar_> spitballing
[23:41:43] <PayMeInSteak_> wait do I have to download a library of some sort to use jQuery?
[23:41:58] <taplar_> danielyaa5: i think you have to put 'e, s' as your handles so it will resize on the south side
[23:42:15] <taplar_> PayMeInSteak_: you have to include the jQuery library
[23:42:56] <PayMeInSteak_> oh okay. Im guessing I can find an API somewhere easily?
[23:42:59] <danielyaa5> taplar_: Ya I got that but I dont know why the table height wont fill the row initially
[23:43:18] <taplar_> PayMeInSteak_: jquery.org has the documentated api
[23:43:26] <PayMeInSteak_> thanks!
[23:43:39] <taplar_> sorry, http://api.jquery.com/
[23:45:18] <_SLM_> I have several elements with name attributes called, for example, 'obj.tree', 'obj.house', 'obj.dog'. How do I search for 'input[name=obj]' and match them? Only for example, obj.dog matches that, but obj seems to not find it. Expecting an exact match?
[23:45:49] <taplar_> [name^="obj"] will match elements that begin with
[23:45:49] <_SLM_> I mean, it doesn't find partial matches
[23:45:57] <_SLM_> ah! thank you!
[23:46:06] <taplar_> ^= begins with, $= ends with
[23:46:12] <taplar_> and i think ~= is contains
[23:46:30] <_SLM_> very nice :)
[23:46:41] <_SLM_> thanks for helping
[23:46:43] <taplar_> sure
[23:47:05] <PayMeInSteak_> do i need to download the jquery api or just include the <link> to the page in my html doc?
[23:47:48] <taplar_> the api is just for your reference.  all you need is to include the source, either by downloading it, hosting it yourself, and including it on your page from there, or just including it from one of the various CDNs
[23:48:37] <taplar_> http://jquery.com/download/ lists the jquery CDN from MaxCDN as well as some others, including googles
[23:48:57] <PayMeInSteak_> oh okay so i can include a google api just like CSS fonts and such
[23:49:04] <PayMeInSteak_> good to know google has my back
[23:49:12] <taplar_> it's just a javascript file, :)
[23:49:16] <PayMeInSteak_> right!
[23:50:03] <taplar_> are you brand new to jQuery?
[23:50:09] <PayMeInSteak_> So if i have my jquery all coded but not the library hosted/linked somehow, nothing will work? thats probably why none of my jquery is working
[23:50:11] <PayMeInSteak_> yes
[23:50:27] <taplar_> you should give learn.jquery.com and try.jquery.com a peruse
[23:50:40] <PayMeInSteak_> *enters peruse mode*
[23:50:44] <taplar_> yes, without the include, and your scripts appearing after that include, you will not be able to use the methods
[23:53:01] <taplar_> i'm fixing to crash though.  late here.  have a good night all.
