[00:17:41] <rizonz> I always need to think about LEGO when I' doing jquery
[02:41:17] <t3q2gs> Hello
[02:45:38] <undefined_bob> morning
[02:46:01] <t3q2gs> undefined_bob you're welcome
[04:02:22] <undefined_bob> when the breakpoint is triggered the menu bar didn't get small enough. On small screens I get a horizontal scroll bar. I think there is something wrong with the @media screen code. would be nice if someone could give me a hint how I could solve this issue
[04:02:40] <undefined_bob> this is the test page: http://undefined.bplaced.net/
[04:02:52] <undefined_bob> and here is a codepen: https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/EvzgQJ
[04:03:15] <undefined_bob> but the result looks awful on codepen (but works well on the test page)
[04:35:27] <Al_nz1> how is this possible that the dom shows a value but I cant seem to retreive it by class? http://imgur.com/a/WDDI3
[04:39:29] <pavonia> There probably is another match before that element which has value=""
[04:39:50] <pavonia> .val() gives the value of the first matched element
[04:50:06] <Al_nz1> pavonia: its Eonasdan selectdate pick
[04:50:08] <Al_nz1> picker
[04:50:21] <Al_nz1> whats in the DOM is not whats in the page source
[04:50:39] <Al_nz1> trying to replicate in a fiddle
[04:53:04] <Cork> Al_nz1: ya, many styling libs replace the dom element and on things like submit populate the original hidden field with the new value
[04:53:19] <Cork> you would have to use there custom getters to access the values correctly
[05:40:21] <undefined_bob> Cork: do you have hint for me why the menu bar didnt get small enough when the browser window hit the breakpoint?
[05:40:54] <Cork> might be you have a width for the ul or nav that is too big?
[05:41:40] <undefined_bob> but it must be in the @media screen code, right?
[05:41:59] <Cork> yes
[05:42:09] <undefined_bob> thank you :)
[05:42:09] <Cork> well one of them
[05:42:16] <Cork> one is for large screens one is for small ones
[05:42:47] <undefined_bob> @media screen and (min-width:900px)
[05:43:19] <Cork> don't remember the code anymore but that sounds like the other way around
[05:43:23] <undefined_bob> because when size get smaller than 900px the bar hide and you have to click a button to see the bar again
[05:43:29] <Cork> that is for screens wider then 900px not smaller
[05:43:42] <undefined_bob> :o
[05:43:47] <Cork> min- <--
[05:44:36] <undefined_bob> I know what you mean but I'm confused now
[05:45:44] <undefined_bob> because everything I change in the code outside of the @media screen and (min-width:900px) affects the bar on large screens
[05:45:50] <Cork> if i remember correctly there was a something like @media (min-width: 400px) {} and one @media (max-width: 399px) {}
[05:45:53] <Cork> or something like that
[05:47:28] <undefined_bob> there is only one which is for the menu bar
[05:49:00] <Cork> then you have changed it too much from what i once wrote for me to comment too much on it
[05:50:29] <undefined_bob> in the code you wrote in your fiddle are two. 500 and 501 px
[05:52:29] <undefined_bob> but I also tried to get the old code running
[05:53:30] <undefined_bob> it works quite nice now beside a few bugs at small screens
[05:53:40] <undefined_bob> http://undefined.bplaced.net/
[06:26:41] <Rixon> Hi, I'm having a problem in Edge: I'm trying to use a data attribute - in css I'm using .selector:after{ content: attr(data-count); } - works in firefox with .attr('data-count', count), but Edge can't create that attribute - just says member not found or name unknown... firefox has no trouble with this. If i just use .data() then the attribute never gets created so css can't see it... any ideas?
[06:36:45] <toothfairy_> Would be happy if someone could show, how I could simplify the following? As you can see both functions uses similar ajax call https://www.pastiebin.com/59b7aafb6e678
[07:13:13] <Cork> Rixon: the reason .data doesn't work is cause it is stored inside jquery in an internal cache
[07:13:23] <Cork> Rixon: attr('data-count') should work though
[07:17:10] <Cork> Rixon: just tested this and it worked just fine https://jsfiddle.net/f1046kg2/
[07:21:13] <Sircle> Is there a way to assign the json to a global variable <script src="../config.config.json"></script>?
[07:21:49] <Cork> if you want to store it globally just create a variable and hold it
[07:22:03] <Cork> $.ajax().done(function(data) { window.lastData = data; })
[07:22:17] <Cork> but not it will still be async so syncron code won't see the change
[07:22:24] <Cork> but note*
[07:24:37] <Cork> toothfairy_: why are you using FormData when you don't do file uploads?
[07:27:05] <Sircle> Cork,  the file is outside the web directory
[07:27:19] <Cork> Sircle: uh, what?
[07:28:01] <Sircle> Ajax can only get the file if its inside the project dir
[07:28:11] <Cork> Sircle: then you can't provide it to the browser at all
[07:28:27] <Cork> only option would be to dynamically generate a script tag inline with the data
[07:28:37] <Sircle> I can by  <script src="../config.config.json"></script>
[07:28:53] <Cork> then it isn't outside the project directory
[07:29:03] <Cork> if a src can access it so can ajax
[07:29:20] <Cork> if it isn't web accessable you have to use server scripts to get it
[07:29:33] <Cork> and then <script src> won't help
[07:30:18] <Cork> a warning though, ../ is a relative path so it might differ depending on where you use it
[07:31:23] <Sircle> Cork,  should this work? https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9032200
[07:35:16] <toothfairy_> Cork: I'm not sure, used it from an example, anything better to replace it with?
[07:42:58] <Cork> toothfairy_: if you have a form just data: $(form).serialize(),
[07:43:13] <Cork> Sircle: no, not at all
[07:44:07] <toothfairy_> Cork: unfortunately I have no form, only the "mail_id" which I set manually
[07:44:49] <toothfairy_> its for a like button type thing, click somewhere and update to true/false
[07:45:38] <Cork> toothfairy_: i would recommend using a form for it anyway
[07:45:43] <Cork> it is normally a cleaner solution
[07:46:04] <Cork> toothfairy_: if you can provide an example snippet of the button (in a jsfiddle) i would help better
[07:46:16] <Cork> would==could
[07:46:38] <MikeD_> yeah, make a fiddle because i'm curious too
[07:46:55] <Cork> there are plenty of ways to do this but what is the correct one is very dependent on what you are actually trying to do
[07:47:08] <Cork> you could use data- attributes too, but might be the wrong answer
[07:47:16] <MikeD_> and because this early i need to see it before i can form words to talk about it
[07:48:43] <Cork> Sircle: you would have to explain why <script src="../config.config.json"></script> would work, but $.ajax('../config.config.json') would not, cause that makes no sense what so ever
[07:49:30] <Cork> unless the server explicitly checks the request header for request-with: xhr and reject the request if it is true, those two queries should be no different what so ever
[07:49:38] <Cork> excpet the second can be json
[07:50:06] <MikeD_> does the $.ajax(..) also run the script?
[07:50:14] <Cork> it isn't a script
[07:50:16] <Cork> its json
[07:50:35] <Sircle> Cork,  if I can make the <script work and put the result in a variable, my problem is solved
[08:00:28] <forgotmynick> afternoon chaps
[08:03:05] <forgotmynick> i have an element that animates when you hover over it or touch it on iPhone. the animation makes the image "flip" over (animates to hide one image and then shows another image). it works fine on all browsers except on safari on iphone. what approach should i use to resolve this?
[08:04:37] <MikeD_> how many safari on iphone users does your site see and what percentage is that?
[08:04:56] <MikeD_> i'm not being flippant about it, this is an ROI calculation
[08:05:49] <MikeD_> as long as basic functionality is available, the cool animation can just not be there for that < 2% population
[08:07:26] <MikeD_> ... unless i'm wrong. :p
[08:13:11] <forgotmynick> i feel you and i personally don't like apple, webkit or safari. the problem is the elements that flip can be accidentally touched on during scrolling which means the user could miss what's on the front
[08:13:57] <forgotmynick> i see touchstart, going to check it out
[08:14:27] <MikeD_> yeah, i wasn't suggesting that i don't like those products... it's just that fixing an animation for a small number of users is sometimes a huge waste of time and risks stability for the majority when you're hacking a fix
[08:14:55] <MikeD_> if UX is bad, it's probably bad regardless of browser
[08:15:29] <MikeD_> but yeah, the user story needs to be completed this sprint... the UX philosophy discussion goes into the backlog for discussion never
[09:59:30] <gamersenior> Hey
[10:03:02] <undefined_bob> hi
[10:04:35] <gamersenior> Could you gimme a little help? I have this little post function and I can't get it to work properly.
[10:04:37] <gamersenior> https://jsfiddle.net/nv2vkvt6/
[10:05:30] <gamersenior> I have this form on my page, I have a controller handling the post request on another url, but somehow the post isn't going to the url I specified.
[10:05:45] <gamersenior> Any ideas?
[10:08:41] <Cork> gamersenior: i would recommend binding submit on the form instead of click
[10:09:09] <Cork> also contexto isn't specified in the fiddle so hard to say what i contains
[10:10:02] <gamersenior> Oh sorry, I'm using JSPs, context is defined in my view as the pageContext
[10:10:16] <gamersenior> I know it's value is correct because other fuctions depends on it.
[10:10:28] <Cork> if you do console.log(contexto, "/menu/efetuaCadastro") what do you get?
[10:10:37] <Cork> (right before the $.post)
[10:12:04] <gamersenior> I get this: /clinica /menu/efetuaCadastro
[10:12:13] <Cork> is that the url you expect?
[10:12:23] <gamersenior> Yes
[10:12:58] <Cork> ok, if you check the browsers network log do you see that url?
[10:13:57] <gamersenior> It's posting on the currect context, not on the url I've specified.
[10:14:17] <Cork> the correct context?
[10:14:28] <Cork> you don't provide any callback handle
[10:14:50] <Cork> so you're just pushing data to and url and ignoring the results
[10:14:54] <gamersenior> I have a github of my project if it's of any help.
[10:14:57] <gamersenior> https://github.com/GamerSenior/gioandbill/
[10:15:32] <Cork> doubt it will
[10:15:47] <gamersenior> Haha
[10:16:12] <Cork> also the code in question isn't in there
[10:16:25] <gamersenior> Okay, I'll try to make a callback handle.
[10:16:31] <gamersenior> You mean the JS?
[10:16:35] <Cork> ja
[10:16:50] <gamersenior> It's here https://github.com/GamerSenior/gioandbill/tree/master/src/main/webapp/assets/js
[10:17:07] <Cork> no there is only gets there
[10:17:37] <gamersenior> Kek, I've just pushed the damn things.
[10:17:41] <gamersenior> Just a sec, sorry for this.
[10:18:03] <gamersenior> refresg
[10:18:17] <gamersenior> Should be there now.
[10:18:49] <Cork> but ya, if you want the same behaviour you most likely want $.post().done(function(data) { $('#main').html(data); })
[10:20:33] <gamersenior> Right after the post?
[10:20:44] <gamersenior> Didn't knew this done method.
[10:21:03] <Cork> $.post(your post is this).done(function(data) { $('#main').html(data): })
[10:21:31] <Cork> .done is deferred, it is the replacement for the old jquery success property callback
[10:21:58] <Cork> so $.post(url, data, callback) => $.post(url, data).done(callback)
[10:22:31] <gamersenior> Oh, Ive read that somewhere
[10:26:18] <gamersenior> Gosh, I can't get this to work
[10:27:27] <gamersenior> It's posting to the actual context intead to the context + url as in the JS.
[10:28:01] <gamersenior> What may be causing this behavior? Can't figure it out.
[10:28:01] <Cork> what does "posting to context" mean?
[10:28:12] <gamersenior> The current page I'm at.
[10:28:36] <gamersenior> Sorry, english isn't my main language.
[10:30:21] <gamersenior> I'm debugging my program, and the request doesn't even hit my controller.
[10:32:40] <gamersenior> You mentioned binding the submit to the form. Would that help anyhow?
[11:11:10] <JordiGH> I have a btn-enabled and btn-disabled CSS class. I want to smoothly transition my button into being disabled. How can I do this?
[11:14:25] <MikeD_> JordiGH: i don't even understand what that would mean
[11:16:08] <JordiGH> The button looks one way with class btn-enabled. It looks a different way with btn-disabled. I want to show the button in several intermediate appearances via an animation.
[11:18:57] <MikeD_> do you know the properties that you're setting things TO with the disabled class?
[11:19:17] <JordiGH> I guess I do.
[11:19:36] <JordiGH> But eh, if it's tricky maybe I'll just forego the animation.
[11:19:44] <MikeD_> otherwise, you'll have to set the class, read the properties, set back to the from, then dynamically generate the animations, ending up with the to state
[11:19:54] <MikeD_> forego the animation is my suggestion  :)
[11:20:02] <MikeD_> but i'm a minimalist
[11:20:09] <JordiGH> The internet told me that .toggleClass() could add a delay for an animation, but I guess the internet lied.
[11:20:25] <MikeD_> nah, the internet told you the truth... but it's not what you thought
[11:21:45] <JordiGH> What does the delay do? Just... delays? No animation?
[11:22:38] <MikeD_> i'm not sure specifically... if you mean fadeout has an interval over which the animation takes to complete, then you can set 500ms or 2000ms
[11:22:52] <JordiGH> No, I meant toggleClass.
[11:23:02] <JordiGH> It *seems* to accept a number as a second argument.
[11:23:15] <MikeD_> idk, that seems weird to me
[11:23:23] <MikeD_> i avoid .toggle*
[11:23:37] <MikeD_> ... been burned by it too many times
[13:40:24] <guideX> with the jquery ui slider, with the "change" event, it fires every number while you're sliding, but what about when you're done sliding? there doesn't appear to be a 'slide complete' event or anything
[13:47:11] <MikeD_> can you use the .blur event on that control?
[13:52:15] <guideX> It doesn't blow up but it doesn't seem to trigger
[13:52:17] <guideX> MikeD_
[13:54:32] <MikeD_> did you click/tab out of the control?
[13:54:58] <guideX> click or tab doesn't raise blur or click actually
[13:54:59] <guideX> only change
[13:58:15] <chasepeeler> is there an easy way to do a case-insensitive :contains()? My current thinking is to store an all lowercase version in an attribute, and then select based on the attribute contents, using an all lower case query.....
[13:59:24] <MikeD_> that's weird - blur should happen
[14:08:06] <guideX> ooo this is working $('.slider-primary').on('mouseup', '.ui-slider-handle', function () {
[14:08:31] <guideX> I think this is a pretty good solution idk
[14:15:41] <MikeD_> it's a good-ish solution, i have no idea how that affects touch-based ui
[14:23:21] <MikeD_> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#event-stop
[15:20:21] <relipse> I have a function ALLOW_SUBMIT() that allows the submit to go through if returns true, or does not if false.. how do I append more functionality to this ALLOW_SUBMIT function?
[15:21:29] <robertmaxrees> "append more functionality" as in...
[15:21:50] <robertmaxrees> 'cause like normally you just write more code in the function.
[15:21:50] <relipse> add a new allow_submit function that gets queued up
[15:22:34] <robertmaxrees> why not just add more logic to your handlers?
[16:00:21] <Levin^> hi there
[16:01:10] <Levin^> I wanted to make a "magnifying glass" effect n a small text that's overflowing its parent element's width
[16:01:20] <Levin^> as a reference: http://mark-rolich.github.io/Magnifier.js/
[16:01:38] <Levin^> but, I just need it to move horizontally, without zooming in
[16:02:04] <Levin^> it's just to be able to read the whole content as you move the cursor through the text
[16:02:22] <Levin^> is there any library that does that?
[16:03:31] <Levin^> and it'll apply the effect on the same text the cursor is hovering
[16:29:22] <chasepeeler> This appears to be working right, but, I just want to make sure I'm not just getting lucky: https://pastebin.com/kdcw36rw  Basic idea is that I need to pull in some values for a select list, and I'll be doing it multiple times, but I only want to make one ajax call. So, I do that if the values aren't cached. However, since I'm returning a promise to $.when(),  I need to also return a promise that contains the
[16:29:23] <chasepeeler> cached value.
[16:30:30] <robertmaxrees> that paste is private btw
[16:30:36] <chasepeeler> ugh, sorry, hold on
[16:31:10] <robertmaxrees> woops.,
[16:32:18] <chasepeeler> https://pastebin.com/FqRX8LXA
[16:32:34] <robertmaxrees> erm
[16:32:51] <robertmaxrees> soooo.,
[16:32:56] <robertmaxrees> you're overthinking this :)
[16:33:15] <robertmaxrees> you just wanmna run that json call once, right?
[16:33:19] <chasepeeler> correct
[16:33:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're making this mor difficult than it needs to be.
[16:34:16] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/80ad2c9fd820
[16:34:19] <robertmaxrees> can literally just do this.
[16:34:59] <robertmaxrees> .then() will run immediately if the promise has already resolved.
[16:35:31] <robertmaxrees> oh and you can kill that callback for the $.getJSON call.
[16:35:58] <chasepeeler> okay... give me a second to try and wrap my head around it
[16:36:02] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/f2985738d102
[16:36:41] <robertmaxrees> basically, you're trying to reimplement part of the reason promises exist heh
[16:37:07] <robertmaxrees> any time you need to use fieldTypes, just make sure you do fieldTypes.then()
[16:37:16] <robertmaxrees> abd pass your callback to taht.
[16:37:55] <chasepeeler> so when would I use when?
[16:37:59] <taplar> you know i never thought about doing that
[16:38:06] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:38:21] <robertmaxrees> chasepeeler $.when comes in when you have multiple promises
[16:38:46] <robertmaxrees> taplar that's one of my favorite features of promises - think of them as future values.
[16:39:27] <taplar> yeah for some reason i never thought of keeping a resolved promise around like that that you could put a then() on to get those values
[16:39:39] <taplar> i'm always like, use it, process it, done
[16:40:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[16:40:22] <robertmaxrees> part of that whole "it resolves once" thing.
[16:41:25] <taplar> heh, little bit of a mind blown here
[16:41:34] <robertmaxrees> rad
[16:41:39] <robertmaxrees> anyway, gotta go.
[16:41:41] <chasepeeler> Now, that's not going to wait until I first need the data to pull it, right? I'm going to have to pull it at some point during load, since the promise will be global... right? In this case, the data is small, so, preloading isn't a big deal... just curious about a situation where I might have a lot of data and not want to pull it unless needed
[16:41:53] <robertmaxrees> erm
[16:42:05] <robertmaxrees> chasepeeler there's a slightly different way to handle that case then.
[16:43:21] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/0844b247e8c7
[16:43:30] <chasepeeler> and, is promise.then(function) equivalent to $.when(promise).done(function())... when dealing with a single promise?
[16:43:38] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> and check out that last paste.
[16:43:58] <chasepeeler> cool... thanks....
[16:44:01] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[16:44:22] <robertmaxrees> aaaaand meeting time.
[16:44:25] <chasepeeler> and taplar, glad to know I'm not the only one that didn't know it (although, I'm pretty new to promises in general)...... yes it does
[16:44:26] <chasepeeler> thank you
[16:45:34] <taplar> it's always fun to learn things that make you break out of the box
[16:54:20] <Es0teric> if i have this -> $('.container_incommon_top').find('.IdPSelectPreferredIdPImg').is('visible')  on an if statement to hide something... why is it not working?
[16:54:44] <Es0teric> so yes, i want to check for display: none
[16:56:06] <taplar> :visible
[16:57:40] <Es0teric> ahhh there we go
[16:57:41] <Es0teric> thanks man
[16:59:32] <Es0teric> @taplar
[17:00:53] <taplar> np
[17:23:03] <energizer> Is there such a selector as "<td> that has a checkbox in it"?
[17:27:07] <taplar> sure, a td can have lots of things in it
[17:27:32] <taplar> but a selector i'd probably recommend
[17:28:12] <taplar> $('td').filter(function(){ $(this).children('input:checkbox').length; });
[17:28:29] <taplar> err
[17:28:37] <taplar> $('td').filter(function(){ return $(this).children('input:checkbox').length; });
[18:16:22] <Slinky_Pete> taplar: yup
