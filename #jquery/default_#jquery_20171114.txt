[04:27:27] <k_sze[work]> Just me or there's a bug in the empty() method?
[04:27:46] <k_sze[work]> $('#mytable>tbody').empty() empties not only the tbody, but also the thead.
[04:27:58] <k_sze[work]> What am I doing wrong?
[04:34:16] <localh0st> k_sze[work]: maybe your table is not correct? it works for me
[04:34:24] <localh0st> k_sze[work]: https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/18582/
[04:34:52] <k_sze[work]> Hold on... why did Firefox stick my head row into the tbody?
[04:39:10] <Cork> k_sze[work]: did you append them to thead?
[04:39:31] <Cork> if you don't have tbody and thead when it parses the html you will get that effect
[04:44:07] <iamarun> help i have a bootstrap invoice page and i was told to use jquery ui ( it alone ) . i have implemented it. But the background is as https://ibb.co/mkUBDG
[04:44:22] <iamarun> how to show jquery ui theme
[04:44:28] <iamarun> and mkae it work
[04:46:16] <k_sze[work]> Cork: I wrote a tr in my thead, in static HTML, but when I check the DOM tree in FF, the tr ends up in the tbody. No idea why.
[04:46:46] <Cork> k_sze[work]: could you make a jsfiddle?
[04:47:18] <Cork> iamarun: you need to include the theme you want to use
[04:47:28] <Cork> looks like you only include the core css file
[04:50:31] <k_sze[work]> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/2hL9zLcx/
[04:50:36] <iamarun> oh! and how should it be included ( any rule like before bootstrap css after ? )
[04:51:13] <Cork> uhh...
[04:51:28] <Cork> k_sze[work]: did you really mean to do $('tr') on line 10?
[04:52:03] <Cork> cause ya, that will move the tr from thead to tbody
[04:52:42] <Cork> k_sze[work]: i suspect you intended to do https://jsfiddle.net/2hL9zLcx/1/
[04:54:39] <k_sze[work]> Wait.. why did it insert numbers instead of fruit names?
[04:54:58] <iamarun> Cork, thanks i included good jquery version and it works now
[04:55:08] <iamarun> Cork, google *
[04:55:36] <Cork> k_sze[work]: cause you use for in on an array
[04:56:40] <Cork> k_sze[work]: https://jsfiddle.net/2hL9zLcx/2/
[04:57:19] <k_sze[work]> Or for .. of?
[04:57:26] <Cork> .forEach
[04:57:49] <Cork> or for(var i=, length=length;i<length;i++) {}
[04:57:57] <Cork> never use in or of on arrays
[05:02:21] <Dro> Hello, Trying to uncheck a radio input with jquery using ".prop("checked", false)" , but it make the radio not checkable at all
[05:02:37] <Dro> how can I simply uncheck it and let the possibility to check it again
[05:03:16] <Cork> Dro: make it a checkbox
[05:03:28] <Cork> radio buttons isn't meant to be unchecked
[05:04:21] <Cork> radio buttons are meant to be a set of options where one of them is always true
[05:05:14] <Dro> Cork: yes thats what I need, but when I click one of the radio the checked radio still checked
[05:05:34] <Cork> Dro: they need to have the same name
[05:05:38] <Dro> I'm not using the same name for radios, for a CMS restriction
[05:05:51] <Cork> then they can't be a group
[05:06:09] <Dro> the only way to make them work together is to use the same name Cork ?
[05:06:16] <Cork> yes
[05:06:26] <Cork> reliably at least
[05:06:49] <Cork> you could have a hidden field and populate it with values from a psudo field name on submit
[05:07:05] <Cork> it will mean it blows up if js is disabled but...
[05:07:21] <Cork> (better option is to modulate that data server side)
[05:12:30] <Dro> Cork: well my problem is all radio inputs return "" in submit (if I use a same name for all inputs)
[05:12:57] <Dro> thats why I eliminated the 'name' prop, and I'm trying to manage this with javascript
[05:13:05] <Cork> $('input[name="the-name"]:checked').val()
[05:13:35] <Dro> Trying to find a way to do this: when radio A is checked, uncheck B and C, and same for B and C
[05:13:35] <Cork> unchecked radio buttons don't send the value in normal forms
[05:13:55] <Cork> Dro: just do it correctly and things will be much easier...
[05:14:47] <Dro> Cork: well I told u, its a restrictions of CMS.. :( can't do nothing.. just have to find an other way
[05:15:52] <Cork> Dro: you can handle this in a form native way even in that case easily
[05:16:20] <Cork> but rebuilding the entire field navigation and interaction in js won't ever be stable
[07:07:48] <Rouless> Hi, anyone can help me with some jquery? I'm doing a masonry grid with css (using relative and absolute, with column counts) and as i have the problem that the parent div has less height than the child (who has an img), I've tried to fix it with some jquery:
[07:07:49] <Rouless> <Rouless> $(window).load(function() {
[07:07:49] <Rouless> <Rouless> $('.item').css('height', $('.item img').css('height'))
[07:07:49] <Rouless> <Rouless> });
[07:07:49] <Rouless> <Rouless> but the problem is that all items have the same height than the first item (or first image), how can i do to apply this for each img, and not apply the height of the first image?
[07:08:28] <Cork> Rouless: make an example in jsfiddle.net
[07:12:26] <Rouless> Cork: i've uploaded it to http://josepcano.com/php/index3.php
[07:12:31] <koa75> hi, is it possible to make this code shorter? http://jsbin.com/kogokuguje/edit?js,output
[08:49:20] <Rouless> Anyone knows how i can do to affect all the divs with the same class, but with different values depending on the div? (I affect the height of many divs with same class, but the height depends on the height of a child img, and for every div this img height is different)
[08:50:36] <Rouless> It affects all the divs, but with the value of the first img child, I've tried with id's and a for, but it doesn't works at all, maybe im coding it bad?
[08:50:46] <Rouless> $(window).load(function() {
[08:50:46] <Rouless>     for (var i=0; i< <?php  mysql_numrows($query) ?>; i++){
[08:50:46] <Rouless>        $('#product-'+i).css('height', $('#product-'+i+' img').css('height'));}
[08:50:46] <Rouless>   });
[08:52:50] <localh0st> oh god,  for (var i=0; i< <?php  mysql_numrows($query) ?>; i++){
[08:52:51] <localh0st> nice
[08:54:01] <localh0st> Rouless: what is the class of the divs?
[08:54:12] <Rouless> it's very bad to mix php and jquery?
[08:54:15] <Rouless> the class is items
[08:54:46] <Rouless> before i had
[08:54:47] <Rouless> $(window).load(function() {
[08:54:47] <Rouless>        $('.item').css('height', $('.item img').css('height'));
[08:54:47] <Rouless>   });
[08:55:00] <Rouless> but it affects all the divs with the height of the first img
[08:55:12] <Cork> Rouless: you would have to use a for loop
[08:55:28] <Cork> Rouless: and don't paste  multi line code in the channel
[08:55:45] <localh0st> Rouless: if I understand your task, I'd use .each() to go through all elements, for every element I'd get the child img and it's height, and I'd set height on item element
[08:56:14] <Cork> and ya... split your backend code and javascript
[08:56:49] <Rouless> Sorry for pasting multiline code :S but, if i split the backend code and javascript, how i know how many loops have to do the for?
[08:57:14] <Rouless> localh0st: i'll look for the each() function, i'm new to jquery so i don't know many functions ^^'
[08:57:29] <Cork> Rouless: you could have something like <ul data-rows="<?php echo mysql_numrows($query) ?>">...
[08:57:47] <Cork> and then just $(elm).data('rows')
[09:02:13] <Rouless> yeeeeaaaaa
[09:02:21] <Rouless> ive tried with each() and it works perfect!!
[09:02:44] <Rouless> thank you very much both of you! I've been all morning with this stupid problem jajajaj
[09:50:55] <jonah> hi can anyone help me out with a slider that is driving me mad! I get console error: 2TypeError: $(...).responsiveSlides is not a function" - Yet everything looks right and I've followed the exmaple on http://responsiveslides.com/
[09:51:09] <jonah> My site with the problem is here: http://www.inyorkholidays.co.uk/test.html
[09:57:36] <codecutter> This works fine i.e. when i hover over the link, a popup box is appended and i'm able to move the cursor onto the popup box without it disappearing - https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/46njng3n/1/
[09:57:41] <codecutter> problem is when i add multiple links, notice how when you hover over one link to another, the popup remains the same (should remove old and create new) https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/46njng3n/2/
[09:57:46] <codecutter> how do i fix this?
[09:58:16] <codecutter> Cork: stop hiding :)
[09:58:33] <Cork> oh, been busy >_>
[10:00:28] <taplar> what if, while it's open, clear the timeout, and then make the new popup?
[10:01:37] <Cork> jonah: you're loading multiple versions of jquery
[10:01:39] <codecutter> show me
[10:01:55] <jonah> Cork: ah thanks!
[10:02:03] <Cork> jonah: so you're loading 1.8.2 and then loads responsiveslider into it, and then you replace it all with 3.2.1
[10:07:29] <codecutter> taplar: i can't get it to work, did you try it?
[10:07:37] <Neo1> Hi
[10:07:43] <codecutter> can i see it?
[10:07:53] <Neo1> Who know how to create anymation on jQuery?
[10:08:01] <taplar> yeah, still playing.  i got it to swap, but the exiting of the popup didn't remove it if you didn't go to a link
[10:08:09] <Cork> Neo1: less generic question?
[10:08:22] <codecutter> tyt
[10:08:40] <Neo1> Cork: wait, I'll prepare
[10:09:24] <Neo1> Cork: wait I'm preparing now
[10:09:26] <Neo1> *
[10:09:42] <taplar> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/46njng3n/3/  so that does the swap, but the timer is broken now for some reason i'm still looking at
[10:13:41] <codecutter> i see the swap now :)
[10:31:01] <codecutter> sorry got disconnected
[10:31:05] <codecutter> tapler *
[10:32:24] <taplar> no worries, i've gotten pulled away
[10:33:46] <codecutter> Cork mind taking a look  https://jsfiddle.net/46njng3n/3/
[10:33:50] <codecutter> timer is not working
[10:34:29] <taplar> yah, i'm not sure why
[10:47:43] <t532> .
[10:53:56] <Cork> codecutter: sorry but, damn thats one messy code structure...
[10:54:15] <codecutter> feel free to clean it up :)
[10:54:22] <Neo1> I am thinking about creating chat
[10:54:29] <codecutter> i'm just trying to get the darn thing to work
[10:54:32] <codecutter> :)
[10:54:41] <Neo1> I'm going to create chat
[10:55:34] <Cork> codecutter: check the console https://jsfiddle.net/46njng3n/4/
[10:56:11] <Cork> so the code works if you never move over the popup
[10:56:17] <codecutter> what i'm looking for?
[10:56:17] <Cork> if you do it stays for ever
[10:56:24] <codecutter> right
[10:56:33] <Cork> the rapidly spinning hover event?
[10:56:53] <codecutter> i can see the problem, how do i fix it?
[10:57:14] <Cork> as i said before, you can't really
[10:57:30] <Cork> you can add an extra mouseleave event on the popup and hide it if it fires
[10:57:39] <Cork> but then it will hide if you move over the link
[10:57:42] <Cork> and.. so on
[10:57:56] <Cork> this is why i said what i said back then
[10:58:09] <Cork> (this is just going to be the start of this wackamole)
[10:58:34] <Cork> anyway i gtg
[13:33:36] <codecutter> see comment https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/46njng3n/5/
[13:34:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.
[13:34:35] <robertmaxrees> codecutter so do you want the popup to disappear if the mouse moves off of the link?
[13:35:38] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: hover over one of the links (don't move the cursor onto the popup) then move cursor onto somewhere else, see how the popup disappears?
[13:35:42] <codecutter> i'll wait
[13:35:51] <robertmaxrees> right...
[13:36:03] <robertmaxrees> so you want it to do the same if the mouse moves onto the popup
[13:36:03] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:36:13] <codecutter> yes
[13:36:41] <codecutter> if the moves moves onto the popop then moves aways, it should close the popup
[13:36:43] <codecutter> remove
[13:37:22] <codecutter> understand?
[13:37:42] <robertmaxrees> lol yeah.
[13:37:57] <codecutter> smart man.
[13:38:28] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're being so condescending?
[13:38:57] <robertmaxrees> and your fix is simple: you're binding listeners to the popups.
[13:39:04] <robertmaxrees> kill those and you're g2g
[13:40:22] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: ican't it get it to work, can i see a jsfiddle?
[13:40:32] <robertmaxrees> get what to work?
[13:40:39] <robertmaxrees> just delete the handlers on the popover...
[13:40:43] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're trying?
[13:40:59] <codecutter> what lines?
[13:41:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:41:19] <robertmaxrees> popup.addEventListener
[13:41:21] <robertmaxrees> these
[13:41:27] <codecutter> both?
[13:41:30] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:41:36] <codecutter> 1 sec
[13:41:58] <codecutter> bruh!
[13:42:06] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:42:08] <codecutter> then i can't hover over the pop
[13:42:10] <codecutter> popup*
[13:42:15] <codecutter> try it
[13:42:17] <codecutter> sorry
[13:42:22] <codecutter> i did not xplain it properly
[13:42:26] <codecutter> my bad
[13:42:30] <robertmaxrees> you said you want the popup to disappear if the users mouse laves the link period.
[13:42:50] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to say the bug is that the popup isn't disppearing after the mnouse enters the popup?
[13:43:25] <codecutter> i want the popup to disappear if the cursor is no longer on the link or the popup
[13:43:34] <robertmaxrees> that works fine here.
[13:43:43] <robertmaxrees> your original fiddle does that,.
[13:44:27] <codecutter> right, but notice the popup does not diappear if the curshor is moved onto the popup then moves away
[13:44:38] <codecutter> moved away*
[13:44:46] <robertmaxrees> it does for me.
[13:45:02] <robertmaxrees> ah, chrome is broken.
[13:45:16] <codecutter> which browser were using ?
[13:45:19] <robertmaxrees> \ff.
[13:45:22] <codecutter> i'm on chrome
[13:45:26] <codecutter> does it work ff?
[13:45:27] <codecutter> let me see
[13:45:29] <robertmaxrees> can you change the markup?
[13:45:36] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, ff worked fine for me.
[13:45:37] <codecutter> no
[13:45:47] <codecutter> i'm stuff with markup
[13:46:20] <codecutter> ah!
[13:46:26] <codecutter> works perfectly on ff
[13:46:32] <codecutter> :)
[13:47:22] <codecutter> safari, too
[13:47:54] <robertmaxrees> either way, simple bug.
[13:48:02] <codecutter> whats the fix?
[13:48:05] <robertmaxrees> chrome is busted because when you mouseenter, you clear the timeout.
[13:48:14] <robertmaxrees> the simple fix is to chjange the markup.
[13:48:31] <codecutter> i don't have the luxuary
[13:48:32] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll need to find a different way to handle that hover/timeout functionality.
[13:48:43] <codecutter> that*
[13:49:25] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: help me out...
[13:49:32] <robertmaxrees> how can i help?
[13:49:38] <codecutter> lol
[13:50:00] <codecutter> help me fix it
[13:50:05] <robertmaxrees> right, so how can i do that?
[13:50:43] <codecutter> anyone else have a solution?
[13:51:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:51:13] <robertmaxrees> are you asking for someone to, like, do it for you?
[13:51:21] <robertmaxrees> super lost about your expectations atm.
[13:51:25] <codecutter> thats exactly what i'm asking!
[13:51:33] <robertmaxrees> oh
[13:51:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah, wrong place for that.
[13:51:38] <codecutter> cause i have no idea how to fix it
[13:51:44] <robertmaxrees> we can help you work through it.
[13:51:51] <robertmaxrees> but we generally won't just do it for you.
[13:51:53] <codecutter> bruh!
[13:51:57] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:52:00] <robertmaxrees> them's the breaks :)
[13:52:02] <codecutter> this aint no homework
[13:52:10] <robertmaxrees> and labor ain't free ;)
[13:52:18] <codecutter> if you can't help then feel frre to just move aisde
[13:52:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:52:24] <codecutter> thanks for the advice
[13:52:27] <codecutter> tho
[13:52:34] <codecutter> but stuff with bullshit
[13:52:37] <codecutter> stop*
[14:13:26] <robertmaxrees> codecutter so you see the issue with that hover handler?
[14:13:37] <robertmaxrees> look at your console.
[14:17:06] <codecutter> it's suppose print 'wat' only once right?
[14:17:24] <robertmaxrees> and it's not :)_
[14:17:36] <codecutter> instead it's triggers on every move
[14:17:39] <codecutter> yeah
[14:17:44] <codecutter> it*
[14:18:32] <robertmaxrees> so there's your first problem.
[14:18:53] <robertmaxrees> and that lets us reframe the issue a bit.
[14:19:02] <codecutter> is it a problem i can fix or is a bug thats out of my hands?
[14:19:14] <codecutter> ok
[14:19:27] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't be adding/removing markup like that.
[14:19:39] <robertmaxrees> that explains why chrome and other browsers are behaving differently.
[14:20:24] <robertmaxrees> did you do the timer for any particular reason?
[14:21:05] <codecutter> timer is there to enable me to move the cursor onto the popup without it disappearing
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[14:21:26] <robertmaxrees> so... any reason you can't just hide things when the mouse leaves the navbar?
[14:22:04] <codecutter> will that help?
[14:22:26] <codecutter> i think handle hide() instead of remove()
[14:22:31] <codecutter> i think i can handle*
[14:22:43] <codecutter> if it helps
[14:22:47] <robertmaxrees> so basically
[14:22:59] <robertmaxrees> you should get rid of all your timeout logic and just hide/show the popup instead.
[14:23:17] <robertmaxrees> then, instead of binding to mouseover and mouseout, use mouseenter and mouseleave
[14:24:34] <robertmaxrees> mouseenter on .hover and .popup should open the popup.  mouseleave on the .navbar should hide the popup.
[14:24:36] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[14:27:07] <codecutter> i set the css for .popup to display none?
[14:27:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd make a utility class called hide or hidden and add/remove that.
[14:27:45] <robertmaxrees> it would set display: none;
[14:27:52] <codecutter> ah, yes
[14:31:57] <codecutter> that works!
[14:33:18] <codecutter> have i missed anything? https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/46njng3n/9/
[14:33:23] <codecutter> seems to work
[14:35:53] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: spot anything?
[14:36:28] <codecutter> I mean have i missed anything?
[14:37:12] * robertmaxrees slaps one_zero around a bit with a large trout
[14:37:17] <robertmaxrees> woops hahahaha
[14:37:18] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[14:37:23] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was away for a sec.
[14:37:38] <robertmaxrees> get those handlers out of the hover logic.
[14:37:50] <robertmaxrees> in fact, your hover/hide should be a lot more simple than that.
[14:38:07] <robertmaxrees> they should just add/remove the class.
[14:38:41] <robertmaxrees> no need to check the open/close states, either.
[14:39:40] <dan_j> Hi, I'm using datatables and using multiselect option. I'm loading the data via ajax. I have a field called 'inuse' and I want to disallow selection of rows where that field is true, but can't seem to find a way to do this. Has anyone got or seen a code example to prevent selection of certain rows?
[14:39:56] <codecutter> how about now? https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/46njng3n/10/
[14:40:18] <codecutter> forgot to remove 'open'
[14:43:05] <robertmaxrees> so what are you using the open var for? :)
[14:43:56] <robertmaxrees> and any reason you're not using jquery for your handlers
[14:43:56] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:44:43] <codecutter> its removed
[14:44:54] <robertmaxrees> and jquery for handlers?
[14:44:56] <codecutter> i'm working on the jq handlers now
[14:45:06] <robertmaxrees> :) can get rid of even more code that way.
[14:46:37] <Malgorath> Hey gang, I was wondering if someone could help me with an idea I'm trying to figure out. I have a table that loads and displays fine. I have a confirmation field on every tr that must be filled in and it compares to the first row correctly, but each time I move the cursor after confirmation is successful it adds +2 then +3 then +4 and I'm confused, I've posted the gist at: https://gist.github.com/malgorath/6a76739c88d0935dff5c085e32f4022f
[14:47:10] <codecutter> https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/46njng3n/12/
[14:47:22] <Malgorath> This is literally a rought sketch of something I might try for work but wondering if I can get it to work before I pitch the idea
[14:49:29] <robertmaxrees> yeahhhhhh codecutter :)
[14:49:42] <codecutter> now i need to try this out on my actual script, it should work
[14:49:52] <codecutter> thanks to you, man!
[14:50:14] <codecutter> robertmaxree: we're cool?
[14:50:24] <codecutter> no hard feelings, bruh! :)
[14:50:35] <robertmaxrees> Malgorath erm. "adds +2 and then +3" etc - could you clarify?
[14:51:04] <robertmaxrees> codecutter all good duder :)
[14:51:14] <codecutter> :)
[14:51:17] <codecutter> thanks, again
[14:51:19] <codecutter> bye
[14:51:36] <robertmaxrees> Malgorath hard to solve the bug when I don't have a text case in front of me.
[14:51:45] <Malgorath> robertmaxrees, for instance, I fill in the first confirmation on Row 0 press enter, it moves to Row 1 confirmation fine, I fill it in, press enter, it moves to row 3(skipping row 2)
[14:52:24] <robertmaxrees> so row_index is getting the wrong row?
[14:52:36] <Malgorath> I have it console.log(row_index) and its saying 0,1,3
[14:52:42] <robertmaxrees> what's with the duplication of that ID?
[14:53:27] <robertmaxrees> i get the feeling that's related.
[14:53:30] <Malgorath> robertmaxrees, I've avoided using jQuery as I don't like depending on client side processing in the past, but I'm making an effort to move towards a balance.
[14:53:41] <robertmaxrees> Malgorath doesn't answer my question :)_
[14:53:43] <Malgorath> So I'm not sure what you mean by duplication of that id
[14:54:06] <robertmaxrees> i don't know PHP but it looks like you're doing  echo "<td><input id='confirmation' type='text' autofocus /></td>"; in some kind of loop.
[14:54:10] <robertmaxrees> that correct?
[14:54:16] <Malgorath> yes
[14:54:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not valid.
[14:54:24] <Malgorath> thats just the confirmation field
[14:54:26] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat an ID.
[14:55:14] <Malgorath> umm in the script it seems to work I even looked up that its valid. Did something change since 2015? (was the date of the tutorial I found)
[14:55:28] <robertmaxrees> duplicate IDs are invalid.
[14:55:36] <robertmaxrees> have been since way early in HTML world.
[14:55:51] <robertmaxrees> using $('[id="confirmation"]') is a hack around that.
[14:56:17] <taplar> https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-id
[14:56:35] <robertmaxrees> so that's a red flag.
[14:57:02] <robertmaxrees> but if row_index is bad, t.row($(this).parent()).index(); isn't doing what you think it's doing.
[14:57:53] <robertmaxrees> also: odd that you're doing a $(this).on() binding inside of an .each()
[14:57:56] <robertmaxrees> any reason for that?
[14:58:23] <Malgorath> robertmaxrees, I'm learning this as I try Ideas out, something are probably not best practice
[14:58:41] <robertmaxrees> that's fine :) just asking if there was a rationale.
[14:58:46] <robertmaxrees> .on() does an implicit each for you.
[14:59:03] <robertmaxrees> so $('.someclass').on() will bind a handler to all elements with that class.
[14:59:40] <Phil-Work> extremely puzzled... not used jQuery for a while however I have a simple <button id="answer">Answer</button>
[14:59:46] <Phil-Work> and I'm trying to do: $('#answer').hide();
[14:59:53] <Phil-Work> this doesn't hide the button... why?
[15:00:34] <Malgorath> robertmaxrees, I'm sorry for the delay, I'm trying to understand what you mean
[15:00:48] <Malgorath> And back to the duplicating ID, is there a better way to do this?
[15:01:45] <Malgorath> should I make it a class instead of an ID?
[15:03:03] <taplar> Phil-Work: is that the only element on the page with that id?
[15:03:10] <Phil-Work> yes
[15:03:32] <taplar> console.log($('#answer').length); and see what that says
[15:03:40] <Phil-Work> I can see in console that $('#answer') is an [button#answer]
[15:03:48] <Phil-Work> length is 1
[15:04:01] <robertmaxrees> taplar that console log will always return 1 or 0.
[15:04:08] <taplar> i know
[15:04:08] <robertmaxrees> gotta do it as an attribute selector instead :)
[15:04:10] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[15:04:13] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[15:04:21] <taplar> do you have any css rules for that element?
[15:04:22] <robertmaxrees> Malgorath you want to use a class in that case instead, yeah.
[15:05:05] <Phil-Work> taplar, no
[15:05:16] <taplar> then i'd need to see a fiddle demonstrating the issue
[15:05:25] <taplar> cause nothing that you've said would cause that to not work
[15:06:29] <robertmaxrees> dynamically creating the element?
[15:06:34] <Malgorath> robertmaxrees, made those changes but still getting a +1 added on to the row_index (visually) while the number still remains the same
[15:07:08] <robertmaxrees> Malgorath "visually"?  are you still getting the logs that say 0, 1, 3?
[15:07:23] <Malgorath> Row 0 filled in, press enter, skips to row 1 filled in, skips to row 3
[15:08:41] <Phil-Work> ah! I was being a tool. Forgot about the whole $(document).ready() thing
[15:08:57] <Phil-Work> funny how much you forget when you haven't used something for a few years
[15:09:13] <taplar> wait, so are you hiding the element on page load with js?
[15:09:38] <Malgorath> robertmaxrees, yes still getting the skipping row_index 0,1,3
[15:10:10] <Malgorath> robertmaxrees, the thing that concerns me most is that I am not incrementing that number to move from 0 to 1, it 'just works' that way and I find that odd
[15:10:21] <Phil-Work> taplar, not any more - I was just trying to get something working to see what hide() did with it
[15:10:25] <Phil-Work> I've added a style now
[15:10:32] <taplar> k, ^_^
[15:27:24] <Malgorath> robertmaxrees, I think the purpose from what I understand fo the $(this).on() is a per <input> keypress catch not just a universal check, but thats my guess, i kind of got that from an online example
[15:33:26] <robertmaxrees> Malgorath you can still do $('.someClass').on('keydown' and it'll do the same thing.
[15:34:07] <Malgorath> robertmaxrees, so the $('.confirmation').each(function () { is not needed?
[15:42:04] <Malgorath> I got it robertmaxrees
[15:50:23] <robertmaxrees> awesome :)
[18:17:55] <joe__> first time here
[18:18:12] <joe__> quiet.
