[01:08:39] <jak2000> hi all, is possible change the color on a PNG with Jquery? (sample, the green by a white?) its correct PNG format or need be a jpg? thanks
[01:50:51] <du_> i've used event.preventDefault(); return false; a thousand times. but for some reason, it's just not working.
[01:51:13] <du_> the weird part is that if developer tools is open, it works
[01:51:24] <du_> i feel like i'm going crazy
[01:52:11] <du_> i'm trying to click a link and replace the child img with a youtube video
[01:52:25] <du_> but even when i reduce the problem, i still experience issues.
[01:52:37] <du_> for example, if i remove the whole youtube api code. it still doesn twork
[02:06:38] <Uhkis> du_: show your code
[02:07:31] <jak2000> Uhkis!
[02:08:10] <Uhkis> ?
[02:12:25] <jak2000> hi all, is possible change the color on a PNG with Jquery? (sample, the green by a white?) its correct PNG format or need be a jpg? thanks
[02:13:10] <Uhkis> i'm fairly sure one can not edit images with javascript on the fly
[02:20:17] <konrados> jak2000 that's why there is svg
[02:25:41] <jak2000> konrados give me please a magic words for try search on googe.com p ls
[02:28:09] <konrados> jak2000 first: javascript svg to learn the basics, then: javascript svg library to find and compare some svg libraries (to make your life easier :) )
[02:31:21] <jak2000> ok thanks
[02:31:32] <jak2000> konrados off topic quesiton, know about mysql?
[02:32:25] <konrados> jak2000, yes, although I'm not an expert, but please bear in mynd there is a #mysql channel and there are good guys there too :)
[02:32:52] <jak2000> join please to #mysql
[02:33:19] <konrados> ok
[02:35:02] <du_> Uhkis: i figured it out
[02:35:03] <du_> it was the context of the click event
[02:35:08] <du_> i was defining it in the .load method of an image
[03:05:49] <hellyeah> yo
[03:05:53] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[03:06:33] <Uhkis> nope
[03:08:43] <hellyeah> i implemented something with using datepicker and dialog you can click datepicker title to get month list. When you select a month , input box is filled with current date. Is there anything you can suggest me to avoid that. It is custom logic what i did here but you may suggest me something to avoid situtation https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/x1j739pt/
[03:10:17] <hellyeah> i can make input box empty when you click box2
[03:10:32] <hellyeah> but what i wonder is, is there any better solution?
[03:12:12] <Uhkis> hellyeah: where in that is the month list stuff, it's a bit big fiddle
[03:12:44] <hellyeah> just a sec
[03:13:33] <Uhkis> well, doesnt even matter, you could just do $(el).val('');
[03:14:02] <hellyeah> line 51- line 143 i may comment out setDate line
[03:14:16] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  this is what i thought
[03:14:22] <hellyeah> does it seem decent solution?
[03:14:52] <Uhkis> it's simple and should work, what's better than that
[03:16:16] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  okey thanks for that
[03:16:36] <hellyeah> btw this feature is implemented in datepicker with different way
[03:16:45] <hellyeah> what i wonder is my implementation looks good
[03:16:47] <hellyeah> _
[03:42:45] <hellyeah> i have two input boxes and two datepicker. input boxes are .from and .to i want to do title of datepicker clickable. For that, i bind an event ui-dateppicker-title thats fine
[03:43:10] <hellyeah> but i want to do different thing in each title how can i select datepicker ininput box .from and .to seperately?
[03:43:50] <hellyeah> any idea?
[04:29:08] <hellyeah> anyone around? :)
[04:44:55] <steveOrElse> guys, stuck with unexplainable
[04:45:49] <steveOrElse> doing a GET request with ajax. Getting back a SeeOther (303) code with Location to redirect. But the browser does nothing about it. Shouldn't that redirect be happening anyway?
[05:41:55] <suexec> In this selector, $('.tree li.parent_li > span') <--- what does the ' > ' signify ?
[05:53:40] <FilipNortic> suexec: direct decdent
[05:54:24] <suexec> FilipNortic, thanks!
[05:57:43] <suexec> FilipNortic, will .parent() with a selector find ALL parents or just the direct ?
[06:01:54] <cryptopsy> how can i load a page into a div from my server? (locally grab, not grab from a different server)
[06:02:47] <cryptopsy> like when an href is clicked, load that link in a div
[06:10:51] <robertparkerx> jQuery(".clicked-href").click(function() { jQuery("#container").append('<div>blah</div>'); });
[06:14:11] <cryptopsy>  was trying   $('#logo').click(function(){ $('.file').load($(this).attr('href')); return false; }); , but it would just open the external link
[06:14:31] <cryptopsy> .file is a class that has an href in it
[06:15:01] <cryptopsy> example:      .file: <a href="computing/bootstrapping-parser.html">bootstrapping-parser.html</a>
[06:15:38] <cryptopsy> .file is in jade syntax, but its <div class=file><a href ...> .. </a> </div>
[06:39:33] <hellyeah> hey there
[06:39:39] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[06:39:51] <AdamPDotty> hell yeah
[06:49:35] <hellyeah> hey
[06:49:41] <hellyeah> i need some help
[06:49:43] <hellyeah> ..:op
[06:49:48] <AdamPDotty> get a doctor
[06:50:03] <hellyeah> you can be my doctor xD
[06:52:43] <hellyeah> in line 5 i bind click event to datepicker-title but if i have more then once input box it binds same event to every datepicker title. What i want is to bind an event spesific datepicker title like . from > .datepicker-title. In my original example i have .from and .to i want to do different things in datepicker-title that is pop up when you click .to input box how can i do this seperation? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/x1j739pt/,
[06:52:50] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/x1j739pt/
[06:55:42] <AdamPDotty> have you tried .on('click',  '.from .datepicker', function ... ?
[06:55:47] <AdamPDotty> not sure, if that does it
[06:56:47] <AdamPDotty> ah there on the bottom
[07:01:42] <AdamPDotty> Could work with the right selector, but its probably cleaner to rehang the handler. $('.from').siblings('.ui-datepicker').find('.ui-datepicker-title').on('click', ...
[07:01:44] <hellyeah> .from .ui-datepicker .ui-datepicker-title you mean AdamPDotty  ?
[07:02:08] <hellyeah> let me try
[07:03:58] <hellyeah> AdamPDotty:  not working here can you check https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/x1j739pt/21/
[07:14:20] <taplar> hellyeah: the last fiddle linked has the switches still in it.  why did you change that back?
[07:14:23] <AdamPDotty> It is possible datepikcer catches the standard events and provides its own.
[07:14:59] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:15:02] <hellyeah> did it
[07:15:06] <hellyeah> let me take a look
[07:15:49] <hellyeah> op yea
[07:15:54] <hellyeah> different fiddle i am cofused
[07:15:57] <hellyeah> xD
[07:16:06] <hellyeah> a sec
[07:16:50] <AdamPDotty> taplar: the .find() part apparently does not work. I do not know why.
[07:17:22] <taplar> which line?  gotta open the fiddle again
[07:17:46] <AdamPDotty> he wrote my idea at the very bottom
[07:17:59] <tmoe> Hi, experiencing selected event fires twice in .selectable() when clicking on a selectable table row and coming from, e.g. other application window. Coming from another tab in browser eerything is working fine.
[07:18:08] <AdamPDotty> so 378
[07:18:20] <tmoe> Ideas where to look at?
[07:18:23] <AdamPDotty> seems, the find returns empty set
[07:18:25] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/x1j739pt/22/
[07:19:48] <hellyeah> taplar:  last three lines on fiddle
[07:21:57] <taplar> werid
[07:22:36] <hellyeah> taplar:  weird?
[07:23:03] <hellyeah> i have .from and .to
[07:23:12] <hellyeah> i have to bind click event to title
[07:23:27] <hellyeah> but i have to do something different in .from and in .to
[07:23:55] <taplar> it doesn't have children according to the dom
[07:24:47] <hellyeah> this is just AdamPDotty  suggestion i couldnt come up with an idea about selecting datepicker-title with .from
[07:25:03] <AdamPDotty> dev tools show children
[07:25:48] <taplar> yah
[07:26:11] <taplar> but the selector.children() is empty and prop('outerHTML') shows it without anything nested inside
[07:26:57] <hellyeah> i checked dom
[07:27:03] <AdamPDotty> $('.ui-datepicker-title').length is 0
[07:27:20] <hellyeah> i couldnt find any visible connection with ui-datepicker and .from
[07:27:38] <taplar> in any case, what's the problem this morning?
[07:27:56] <taplar> btw you still haven't condensed your bottom switch that we said yesterday and the day before that you could probably make smaller
[07:28:18] <taplar> and your repeating lookups all over the place, -_-
[07:28:23] <taplar> how many times do i have to tell you about that
[07:29:13] <hellyeah> i wrote this very quick :p
[07:29:26] <taplar> so why did you repeat lookups?
[07:29:41] <taplar> just cause you did it quick?
[07:29:46] <hellyeah> yes
[07:29:52] <hellyeah> i will fix everything
[07:29:53] <taplar> you should ALWAYS try to do the best practices so they are second nature
[07:30:08] <hellyeah> you are right
[07:30:13] <taplar> otherwise your going to spend more time later cleaning up your stuff
[07:30:30] <hellyeah> yes
[07:30:36] <hellyeah> thats the lesson i have to practice more
[07:31:04] <hellyeah> i need more practice
[07:31:16] <taplar> so jump on it!
[07:31:33] <hellyeah> okey first i need to solve this problem
[07:31:39] <hellyeah> any particular suggestion
[07:31:40] <hellyeah> ?
[07:31:40] <taplar> no, you should clean up first
[07:31:52] <taplar> it will be much easier to see what the problem actually is then
[07:32:27] <taplar> you don't build an addon to a house with a bad foundation and then fix the foundation.
[07:32:49] <hellyeah> okey then i will do it
[07:34:15] <taplar> this is also an important point cause it can help you break the mind set of after you fix something, "I should clean it up....... but it works so...... nah."
[07:35:26] <hellyeah> actually you are right
[07:35:35] <hellyeah> i feel lazy to clean it up the code i wrote
[07:35:43] <taplar> i'm aware, ;)
[07:35:43] <hellyeah> i have to do it write in first time
[07:35:53] <hellyeah> :p
[07:36:32] <hellyeah> let me see what i can do
[07:39:23] <hellyeah> taplar:  let me ask a question ab out functionality
[07:39:31] <taplar> sue
[07:39:40] <taplar> *sure
[07:39:52] <hellyeah> when you click the title you will get monthList and when you click any month. Datepicker show that month. Thats good
[07:40:07] <hellyeah> will you open datepicker when you click month
[07:40:16] <hellyeah> or is it enough to change the month only
[07:40:20] <hellyeah> what do you think?
[07:40:42] <taplar> i'd probably show the month
[07:40:53] <hellyeah> so you show datepicker
[07:40:56] <hellyeah> i understand
[07:41:18] <hellyeah> btw is my idea good do i have improvement?
[07:41:20] <taplar> yeah simply because the chances of them wanting the same day in the other month are probably low, so they'd have to click it again to make it show anyway
[07:41:55] <taplar> it's fine if it solves a problem the users have
[07:42:03] <hellyeah> i couldnt find how to remove current day to show
[07:42:05] <taplar> if your doing it just to do it then well...
[07:42:45] <hellyeah> understood
[07:43:08] <hellyeah> thanks for pointing me out right direction
[07:43:17] <hellyeah> you know mostly people wouldnt do that
[07:43:28] <hellyeah> i couldnt get any support from my collegue
[07:43:29] <hellyeah> thats so bad
[07:43:52] <taplar> in what regard?  i thought you were kinda the only js person they have
[07:44:31] <hellyeah> they should know some js
[07:44:33] <hellyeah> right?
[07:44:37] <taplar> idk
[07:44:42] <hellyeah> also i am developing whole algorithms
[07:44:47] <taplar> i'd say the majority of people in my shop don't know it
[07:44:48] <hellyeah> i find what i use
[07:45:05] <hellyeah> i did everything including writing js
[07:45:19] <hellyeah> and i am doing everything they request
[07:45:31] <hellyeah> they try to rule me out now
[07:45:37] <hellyeah> that sucks
[07:46:09] <taplar> sounds like you need to get really good at it and then go shopping around for other places that need you more
[07:46:52] <taplar> though obviously i don't know your situation so, just me talking
[07:47:52] <hellyeah> sure
[07:48:01] <hellyeah> i am looking for another job now
[07:48:14] <hellyeah> there are many places for shopping
[07:48:17] <hellyeah> tbh
[07:48:31] <taplar> that's good then, if your skill set is in demand
[07:52:50] <hellyeah> i wrote backend also frontend
[07:52:59] <hellyeah> they should give me some advantages
[07:53:05] <hellyeah> anyway back to the code
[07:53:07] <hellyeah> :)
[07:54:47] <neo12> Works if I call the function from a script block inside the html but get error when called script file Uncaught TypeError: $(...).imageScale is not a function on line 25
[07:54:57] <neo12> http://pastebin.com/59WdRUiW
[07:58:56] <codecutter> here is the function script https://github.com/gestixi/image-scale
[07:59:15] <taplar> i don't know much about require.  but that would seem to say that it has not been added to the jQuery namespace by the time you try to use it
[08:01:18] <codecutter> right. how do i fix it?
[08:02:47] <taplar> dunno.  maybe hit up #requirejs and see what they have to say
[08:03:04] <suexec> I have a fairly large nested <ul><li> list . Is there any way I can transcend the tree from the last element and outwards - and hide elements in the process based on certain criteria ?
[08:03:37] <taplar> ascend the tree you mean?
[08:04:03] <suexec> Thank you. My English is a bit .. poor.
[08:04:12] <codecutter> I didn't know room exists
[08:04:20] <codecutter> thx
[08:04:21] <codecutter> :)
[08:04:23] <taplar> sure
[08:04:39] <taplar> suexec: can you describe it more?  just to make sure i know what your wanting
[08:05:59] <suexec> taplar, I am creating a css based tree view of a file system. I would like to ascend the structure, and if all elements contained within a directory check out, I would like to collapse the folder. However, if any of the elements contain whatever criteria, I need the folder to be open.
[08:06:40] <taplar> so like a folder/file filter
[08:19:51] <suexec> taplar, something like that I guess. I have attribute markings for files and folders etc .. I just need to "collapse" the ones that I want closed. The problem is that the tree I am using is CSS based and used "display:none" to hide elements ..
[08:20:33] <Uhkis> show() hide() also uses that on the element
[08:20:38] <codecutter> got it
[08:20:48] <codecutter> got it
[08:24:21] <suexec> Uhkis, taplar , Is there any way I can apply a function each element of a find() result? i.e $('.tree li:has(ul)').find('[data-filetype="directory"]').each(function(element) { .. .})
[08:24:51] <taplar> suexec: little quick and dirty possibility https://jsfiddle.net/aytoce3q/
[08:30:10] <Uhkis> taplar: not to mention not working! :D
[08:30:17] <taplar> hmm?
[08:30:35] <Uhkis> taplar: typing anything hides everything except the root files
[08:30:53] <taplar> you can put class="folder" on the outer li to take care of that
[08:30:56] <Uhkis> doubt that was what suexec wanted
[08:31:57] <suexec> taplar, here's an example of what I have: https://jsfiddle.net/59f6gs82/
[08:31:59] <taplar> and he only said collapsing folders.  he didn't say anything about hiding non-matching file names, :)
[08:33:04] <suexec> taplar, so pretty much I would like "Folder 2" to be "collapsed", because everything beneath is "ok". But in Folder 1, there is an element that is "NotOk", and therefore it must be shown
[08:33:44] <taplar> what defines 'not ok'?
[08:34:16] <Twirl> hi, how do you remove "TEXT" from <a href="#"><img src="1.jpg">TEXT</a> ?
[08:34:19] <taplar> the filestatus i gues
[08:34:36] <suexec> taplar, when I generate the tree, I set attributes via php code .. so I know before hand if a file is "NotOk" or is good.
[08:34:49] <Uhkis> Twirl: .text('');
[08:35:20] <taplar> here's a small question then
[08:35:28] <taplar> why is the folder 'ok' when a child is 'NotOk' ?
[08:36:14] <suexec> taplar, because the md5 of the folder itself checks out and exists on both server and client. But in theory, I suppose the folder should be marked as not ok as well
[08:36:24] <taplar> i would agree
[08:37:23] <Twirl> Uhkis: wrong answer
[08:37:29] <taplar> wow
[08:37:41] <Twirl> anyone else?
[08:37:47] <taplar> maybe be nicer?
[08:37:49] <Uhkis> Twirl: do tell the right one then
[08:38:31] <Twirl> Uhkis: i'm asking because I dont know and thought maybe it was faster to just ask here than to try stuff myself or google it
[08:39:09] <Twirl> i know a couple of ways of doing it, but which one is the right one
[08:39:13] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/7a1gb7kk/
[08:39:17] <Uhkis> i dont see any text there
[08:39:36] <Twirl> Uhkis: are you retarded or a troll?
[08:39:40] <Twirl> anyways, ignored
[08:39:53] <taplar> Uhkis: i'm pretty sure that removes the img as well
[08:40:22] <Twirl> how is this person here giving advice, idk, seriously
[08:40:32] <Twirl> irc chat quality keeps declining
[08:40:41] <Uhkis> taplar: interesting, it shouldnt
[08:40:51] <taplar> Twirl: we don't have to help you if that's what you want
[08:41:31] <Uhkis> i like this Twirl, comes to ask for free help and starts throwing out tantrums :-)
[08:41:32] <Twirl> taplar: no you don't have to do anything, i know
[08:41:53] <Twirl> taplar: it's just, generally i consider good manners to only answer a question if I actually know the answer
[08:42:16] <Twirl> but that's just me
[08:42:19] <taplar> there's also such a thing as sound boarding
[08:42:31] <Twirl> i guess other people would rather say w/e crosses their mind
[08:42:44] <taplar> but regardless both people asking and answering questions are intended to follow the chat guidelines
[08:43:16] <Twirl> yea i will just sit here and w/e question arises i will just tell them to turn off and on the computer
[08:43:28] <Twirl> if that's not trolling, idk
[08:43:34] <taplar> sure, good luck with your question then
[08:43:57] <Twirl> well, it's not like i had luck before
[08:45:31] <Twirl> where is cork when u need him
[08:47:08] <suexec> Twirl, https://jsfiddle.net/j0fyv7u7/
[08:47:25] <Twirl> suexec: yea i thought that
[08:47:30] <Cork> Twirl: there is two options
[08:47:43] <Cork> either wrap the text in a separate element
[08:47:49] <suexec> taplar, any idea how I can crack my problem given the setting I put in the fiddle? :)
[08:47:53] <Cork> or you have to use nodes instead of elements
[08:48:33] <Uhkis> Cork: and now you taught him temper tantrums work!
[08:48:35] <taplar> suexec: ah, i thought you were going to change the folder to reflect 'NotOk', ;)  in which case it'd be a simple selector thing
[08:48:39] <Twirl> Cork: well, the text is there i have to remove it manually, maybe with suexec solution, storing the <img> and then using it to replace the contents of the parent
[08:49:09] <Cork> Twirl: that solution will replace everything inside the outer element
[08:49:18] <Cork> so all event handlers that could be there would be lost
[08:49:24] <Twirl> but maybe there was something jquery like $('#').removeText() or w/e
[08:49:29] <Cork> no
[08:49:41] <Cork> you would have to grab all the nodes of the parent
[08:49:47] <Cork> loop over them and check if it is a text node
[08:49:51] <suexec> taplar, problem is that the parent folder is generated before the file , so "ok" is already set for the folder :(
[08:50:14] <taplar> ah so it's not like in an array or something that you can change?
[08:50:27] <taplar> boooooooo, :D
[08:50:38] <Twirl> Cork: alright, gotta try it out
[08:50:54] * Cork goes back to what he needs to do
[08:51:03] <Twirl> Cork: ty
[08:51:10] <Twirl> suexec: nice doggy
[08:52:01] <suexec> taplar, it's a bit complex. My file list is an array ... but not a sorted one. I then have a second function that parses the output and creates the html for the tree.
[08:52:50] <taplar> i was assuming your array would be a nested array similar to the generated tree
[08:53:06] <taplar> lets see though
[08:55:15] <suexec> taplar, it's not nested. I pretty much create one entry pr folder and a list of contained items.
[08:55:52] <taplar> so one entry per folder with a list of contained items.  what if one of those items is a folder?
[08:55:56] <suexec> Maybe I would be better of making the initial array nested though, and then just set everything there
[08:56:13] <suexec> That will then create another root elements, being that folder and a list of items.
[08:56:20] <suexec> another root element*
[08:56:32] <taplar> how do you then know that it is a sub folder of another folder?
[08:57:03] <suexec> Attribute given to the file/folder, dictating what's the parent
[08:57:11] <taplar> ok
[09:08:41] <suexec> taplar, any bright ideas? :P I've been messing with this sh*t all day :(
[09:08:55] <taplar> what about this? https://jsfiddle.net/59f6gs82/1/
[09:11:47] <suexec> is span[data-filestatus!=""] a valid selector?
[09:12:07] <taplar> probably
[09:14:09] <AdamPDotty> can not find !, just  $, *, ~, |
[09:14:39] <AdamPDotty> but there is ":not"
[09:14:50] <suexec> https://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/
[09:14:52] <suexec> looks ok
[09:14:53] <taplar> i was just going to say or the not() filter
[09:17:57] <suexec> taplar, works :) But it's hella slow as I have to loop a couple thousand files :P
[09:18:06] <taplar> egh
[09:18:53] <suexec> I'm going to do some array sorting in php and add attributes there I think
[09:20:45] <Uhkis> suexec: why are you trying to do this yourself?
[09:21:14] <Uhkis> suexec: https://www.jstree.com/ doesnt suit your usecase?
[09:25:39] <_TWG_> Just hoping to pick someones brain.  I'm just looking for suggestions of "best practice".  A shove in the right direction would be great.  I'm working on a map project with leafletjs.  I have all my data setup in 3 different JSON files and when my jquery starts, I call the files once and store them in an array.  From there I need to read the catego
[09:25:39] <_TWG_> ry on one of the arrays and put them in category lists.  Each point can belong to multiple categories.  What would be the best way to do this?
[09:32:40] <suexec> Uhkis, I was using that previously. I'll keep hacking some more at it and see if I can make that work properly.
[09:38:26] <Twirl> jQuery("li[data-normalized-text='<span class=" + '"text"' + ">Mansion</span>']").attr('data-normalized-text', '<span class="+ '"text"' +">House</span>'); missing ) after argument list?
[09:38:54] <Twirl> how am i supposed to put the class in the attribute without " or ' ? maybe create the string in a variable?
[09:41:08] <taplar> it looks like your appending in your attr set is missmatched quote types
[09:41:21] <taplar> '<span class="+
[09:42:39] <Twirl> it should be data-normalized-text="<span class="text">House</span>", that's how it shows in the Elements tab
[09:42:55] <taplar> right but your trying to concat strings there
[09:43:08] <taplar> so it's either ''+'' or ""+"" or the like
[09:43:19] <taplar> '  "+ is not matching quotes
[09:43:21] <Twirl> isn't "" closing the string
[09:43:31] <taplar> no cause you started with '
[09:43:55] <taplar> '<span class="'+
[09:46:13] <Twirl> Alright
[10:56:12] <codecutter> line 4 on this block of code behaving strange, sometimes runs, other times I get "Uncaught TypeError: this.select(...).imageScale is not a function"  http://pastebin.com/zje5pjcm
[11:02:59] <decx> the is select doing there
[11:03:02] <decx> isnt that an event
[11:03:06] <decx> hell
[11:07:29] <_zsc_> anybody here?  I'm just learning and trying to hide a div based on a button click, but it's not wokring for me.  Where am I going wrong?  Thanks - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/48cf8bdc4a73bd8cf545347989feb900
[11:07:50] <taplar> would the 'this' there even be the element?  isn't .onload = ... the same as an inline binding?
[11:10:59] <Uhkis> _zsc_: looks fine, did you include jquery before that part?
[11:13:11] <_zsc_> Uhkis: Yes, I did.  All of the other Jquery functions are working fine, excpet the one that hides the #basicFunctions div
[11:13:53] <AdamPDotty> you have to prepend the id with #
[11:15:09] <_zsc_> I got it thanks
[11:15:31] <_zsc_> my div had an id="#basicFunctions", rookie error
[11:15:35] <_zsc_> thanks all the same
[11:16:13] <AdamPDotty> ...
[11:16:22] <Uhkis> _zsc_: on another note, there's toggle() for show/hide
[11:16:57] <_zsc_> ok, so it will show if hidden; and hide if visible?
[11:17:02] <Uhkis> yes
[11:17:08] <_zsc_> that's great thanks
[11:17:35] <_zsc_> awesome!
[12:00:13] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeee
[12:00:30] <taplar> :)
[12:01:08] <taplar> oh yeah, i was meaning to gloat when you showed up
[12:01:29] <taplar> 4in of rain today!
[12:01:37] <robertmaxrees> jeeeerrrrk!
[12:01:40] <taplar> ;)
[12:01:43] <robertmaxrees> we're actually doing a LOT better now.
[12:01:49] <taplar> good deal
[12:03:25] <robertmaxrees> http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?CA
[12:03:53] <taplar> ouch
[12:03:58] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:04:27] <NoiseEee> gotta bake it real good before it falls into the ocean
[12:04:37] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[12:04:53] <robertmaxrees> i get the sense this is going to be a weird summer.
[12:05:30] <taplar> given that we didn't have a winter, insects are going to be crazy this year
[12:05:39] <robertmaxrees> oooh?
[12:06:10] <taplar> no snow or really any ice.  so nothing to help kill them off a little
[12:06:29] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy.  that'll be rought.
[12:06:32] <robertmaxrees> *rough
[12:06:40] <Uhkis> drought? warmth? what on earth are you talking about? BR. finland
[12:06:51] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis hahaha
[12:06:54] <robertmaxrees> lucky you.
[12:07:21] <taplar> doesn't finland get attacked by russia all the time?
[12:08:22] <Uhkis> taplar: yeah, like once in a century
[12:09:33] <taplar> lol.  i may be misinformed.  i remember in my youth talking in chat with a dude who either lived there or in sweden, talking about the standing army cause russia was always pulling crap on them
[12:10:31] <Uhkis> taplar: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9cHkMILP4_A/Su8p3GFJJOI/AAAAAAAABHc/yywQlkVuUD4/s800/fdccax.jpg
[12:10:38] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:10:41] <MEGAGHZ> is finland cool?
[12:10:47] <robertmaxrees> my favorite factoid of wwii
[12:11:25] <Uhkis> MEGAGHZ: not at the moment, +12C
[12:11:37] <MEGAGHZ> -?
[12:11:55] <MEGAGHZ> is that cold?
[12:12:21] <Uhkis> cold?! that's almost too hot :D
[12:12:24] <awkwardCough> 53.6F for Americans
[12:12:45] <taplar> you need to cough at your own statement
[12:12:50] * awkwardCough 
[12:13:27] <MEGAGHZ> omg
[12:13:33] <MEGAGHZ> you are in summer now
[12:16:13] <Uhkis> yeah, but only a few months until winter!
[12:16:25] <taplar> i can't deal with cold.  fk that
[12:16:44] <Uhkis> cold is awesome, a cold is not :D
[12:17:15] <taplar> i'll take bikini's over snow bunnies any day
[12:24:30] <NoiseEee> im sick of cold weather
[12:24:38] <NoiseEee> the older i get the less i'm into it
[12:24:40] <merced> i want more cold weather
[12:24:42] <NoiseEee> gimme snow, but f the cold
[12:25:17] <robertmaxrees> i love cold weather for the most part.
[12:25:36] <robertmaxrees> but I hate rain.
[12:25:49] <awkwardCough> im with the cold crowd, moving south is sometimes the most lukewarm mistake ive made
[12:26:05] <MEGAGHZ> with cold you can actually think
[12:26:19] <taplar> sure, "brrrr, fk, brrrr"
[12:26:53] <awkwardCough> comparatively, "man its hot here today"
[12:28:35] <taplar> lol, i didn't mean to take the room this much off topic, but that brings up an interesting question
[12:28:56] <taplar> in places that are predominantly colder, is the flu going on there year round?
[12:29:52] <taplar> or have the immune systems been tempered enough that they laugh at it, heh
[12:29:57] <decx> do you have a cold a winter long?
[12:30:01] <decx> all
[12:30:50] <taplar> no, but i mean the whole thing with the flu spiking in winter due to people staying in doors more in more enclosed air places more frequently.  you know the whole deal
[12:31:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd bet people in colder climates aren't as bothered by it being cold as may not stay indoors as much.
[12:31:40] <robertmaxrees> but i could have that wrong.
[12:31:49] <taplar> true
[13:19:02] <ks> how do I add and remove rows to table? here's my jquery code http://jsbin.com/reyimunopu/edit?js  the problem is that it appends a lot of rows, while I need to re-create it on change event
[13:20:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:20:20] <robertmaxrees> .append() and .remove()
[13:21:09] <ks> robertmaxrees:  append works fine, I just wonder how do I remove previously created rows :)
[13:21:16] <robertmaxrees> .remove()
[13:21:30] <robertmaxrees> not sure what else you need to know heh.
[13:23:01] <taplar_lunch> or $('#filtered').empty();
[13:23:12] <robertmaxrees> sure.  there are a few different ways.
[13:23:44] <ks> robertmaxrees:  i'm just a beginner
[13:23:52] <robertmaxrees> ks so what are you confused about?
[13:23:58] <ks> taplar_lunch: would it remove entire table?
[13:24:05] <taplar_lunch> empty removes the children
[13:24:08] <robertmaxrees> depends on what #filtered is.
[13:24:25] <robertmaxrees> ks do you mean you're havign a hard time removing specific rows?
[13:24:48] <ks> robertmaxrees: yes, i'm rebuilding rows on change event
[13:24:57] <robertmaxrees> why rebuild?
[13:25:03] <robertmaxrees> why not add/remove the specific ones you need?
[13:25:18] <taplar_lunch> or is the set changing, or are you optionally only showing a subset?
[13:25:31] <robertmaxrees> ^ i feel like a more fleshed out fiddle/bin would be nice.
[13:25:34] <taplar_lunch> cause a subset would be like show hide
[13:25:37] <ks> robertmaxrees: it's a filter by price, so easier to provide already filtered array
[13:25:54] <robertmaxrees> so then really you want to clear the table and redo the whole thing/
[13:26:28] <ks> the html is pretty simple  <table id='filtered' ><tr>...<td>Price</td></tr></table>
[13:26:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:26:54] <taplar_lunch> do you have column headings?
[13:27:19] <ks> my code appends new rows to this table
[13:27:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/
[13:27:46] <ks> taplar_lunch:  yeah, I just removed it to not pollute the channel
[13:28:05] <robertmaxrees> ks that's why you paste into a fiddle or bin instead :)
[13:28:09] <taplar_lunch> ^make that fiddle represent your situation
[13:28:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:28:22] <ks> ok, give me one sec
[13:29:11] <ks> https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/1/
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> so what's the array?
[13:30:15] <ks> robertmaxrees: it's a json array with elements containining objects
[13:30:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:30:23] <robertmaxrees> i know what arrays are.
[13:30:23] <taplar> personal side note, i think your going to want a thead
[13:30:27] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[13:30:33] <robertmaxrees> i mean can you share an example of your data?
[13:30:47] <ks> taplar: ok, so that it stays iuntouched, right?
[13:30:52] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:30:57] <robertmaxrees> that way you can target the tbody
[13:32:21] <ks> changed https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/4/
[13:32:26] <taplar> and another side note, you don't have to escape your " in that string
[13:32:41] <robertmaxrees> ks that's not how you use thead.
[13:32:44] <robertmaxrees> look at my last fiddle.
[13:33:39] <ks> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/3/ < this one?
[13:33:46] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:33:51] <robertmaxrees> <thead> goes around a <tr>
[13:34:03] <robertmaxrees> could you provide an example of your array?\
[13:35:30] <ks> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/5/
[13:36:01] <robertmaxrees> raaaad
[13:36:03] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:36:34] <robertmaxrees> so instead you'll want to .appendTo('#filtered tbody');
[13:36:55] <robertmaxrees> and before you do anything you'll want to empty that selection instead - BUT there's a slightly cleaner way to do this.
[13:38:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jz5jga78/6/
[13:38:54] <robertmaxrees> do something like thi instead.
[13:38:56] <robertmaxrees> *this
[13:39:27] <taplar> or map to save redraws
[13:39:45] <decx> you dont draw anything when you createElement
[13:39:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:39:51] <taplar> when you append?
[13:39:59] <robertmaxrees> not to a fragment.
[13:40:02] <decx> yeah but that doesnt touch the dom
[13:40:10] <robertmaxrees> at least, not the rendered DOM.
[13:40:15] <taplar> oh! i see what you did
[13:40:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:40:39] <robertmaxrees> also ks i might consider using a templating engine if it gets more complex than this.
[13:40:46] <decx> still ugly 2way
[13:40:47] <decx> right
[13:41:01] <taplar> i'm confused how that escape is not fubaring the images
[13:41:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jz5jga78/7/ here
[13:41:21] <robertmaxrees> fix'd the escape :)
[13:41:59] <ks> robertmaxrees:  thanks, I'm trying it now :)
[13:43:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/8/ header was being lost
[13:43:27] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:43:33] <robertmaxrees> m'bad
[13:46:05] <ks> doesn't change with range slider
[13:46:14] <robertmaxrees> ....
[13:46:20] <robertmaxrees> because none of that includes a change handler?
[13:46:24] <ks> sec, I'll provide more details
[13:46:57] <robertmaxrees> take a look at the docs for the slider and find stuff related to the change event.
[13:47:17] <taplar> the example illustrates how to do the replace of the body.  just a matter of pluging that in your change event
[13:47:21] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:47:22] <taplar> *tbody
[13:47:33] <robertmaxrees> I'm guessing your data is coming from an ajax call.
[13:48:28] <ks> robertmaxrees: no it's a static data, I'm just filtering it in jquery
[13:48:33] <taplar> :D
[13:48:40] <robertmaxrees> *javascript fwiw.
[13:48:53] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, just hook into your change event.
[13:49:09] <taplar> i'd show/hide personally if it's static
[13:49:24] <robertmaxrees> That's one way.  I'd do the wholesale replace.
[13:50:44] <ks> how do I include UI elements?
[13:50:49] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[13:50:56] <ks> in jsfiddle
[13:51:06] <robertmaxrees> lol i mean by "ui elements"
[13:51:08] <robertmaxrees> you mean jquery ui?
[13:51:12] <ks> have a look https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/9/
[13:51:23] <taplar> change it to 2.1.4 and ui will be an option to select
[13:51:27] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:52:44] <taplar> you don't have to do a jquery closure in that top function
[13:53:15] <taplar> your calling it from a function that is called from inside a jq closure
[13:53:31] <robertmaxrees> you mean doc ready?
[13:53:38] <taplar> yah
[13:53:42] <ks> yeah jquery ui - slider is not rendered, tried a couple of options still don't show it properly
[13:53:48] <robertmaxrees> 'cause jquery closures are those things that protect $
[13:54:02] <robertmaxrees> ks look at what taplar suggested.
[13:54:20] <taplar> ah, so your consider jQuery(function($){}) a jqclosure, not $(function(){}) ?
[13:54:28] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:54:37] <robertmaxrees> (function($) {}(jQuery));
[13:54:43] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.
[13:54:50] <taplar> heh, i just call that an iife, :)
[13:55:05] <robertmaxrees> it's also that - but it's an IIFE to protect $.
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:55:56] <robertmaxrees> ks i don't see a slider-range anywhere in your HTML./
[13:56:16] <ks> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/11/
[13:56:39] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:56:47] <taplar> 2.1.4 dude
[13:56:56] <robertmaxrees> ks drop jquery down to 2.1.4 and then check the jquery ui checkbox.
[13:57:32] <ks> robertmaxrees:  thanks, now it works :)
[13:57:55] <ks> i mean, I can see slider
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[13:58:12] <gambl0re> hi robert
[13:58:17] <robertmaxrees> hey gambl0re
[13:58:35] <gambl0re> i want to ask you if you had lunch yet but i know you dont like it so i wont ask
[13:58:46] <taplar> lol
[13:59:10] <robertmaxrees> that stopped being funny a long time ago.
[13:59:34] <gambl0re> what?
[14:00:26] <merced> lol wow
[14:00:38] <robertmaxrees> Moving on!
[14:00:48] <robertmaxrees> ks that all making more sense now?
[14:00:59] <gambl0re> i dont know why he kicked me
[14:01:01] <gambl0re> anyways
[14:01:14] <taplar> ks as far as providing the array to give to the display when a change happens, look into using filter
[14:01:22] <ks> robertmaxrees: sorry i was distracted by this slider thing, might missed important stuff you suggested
[14:01:56] <robertmaxrees> It's all good :)
[14:01:57] <taplar> and you may or may not want to do some parseInt or parseFloat in there
[14:02:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:02:09] <ks> taplar: not sure I completely understand :)
[14:02:18] <taplar> are you familiar with array filtering?
[14:03:02] <ks> taplar: ah, some array manipulation ?
[14:03:18] <taplar> just filter.  what kind of IE support do you have to have?
[14:03:57] <ks> taplar:  minimal if at all
[14:04:12] <taplar> so not concerned with older IE versions
[14:04:30] <taplar> specifically < 9
[14:05:31] <taplar> in that case you can use the native filter function to get only the elements you want
[14:05:50] <robertmaxrees> alternatively you can include es5-shim and not worry about it :)
[14:06:12] <robertmaxrees> es5-shim + jquery makes your life a lot easier when handling older browsers.
[14:06:18] <taplar> arr.filter(function(){ /* logic goes in here testing 'this' to see if it should be included in the results.  return true for those that should */ });
[14:07:17] <Lucchia> Anyone who can help with jquery accordion?
[14:07:27] <robertmaxrees> Lucchia plenty of people can.
[14:07:36] <robertmaxrees> put your question in the channel. if somebody can help, they will :)
[14:07:52] <ks> taplar: like this ? https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/12/  < i've added new function
[14:07:58] <Lucchia> I'm trying to get an accordion to open up when I click on a link
[14:08:57] <robertmaxrees> Lucchia alright  so where are you stuck?
[14:08:59] <taplar> ks: yeah, now the only thing you need to do is make sure all of those things are numbers
[14:09:20] <Lucchia> I've put my accordion code
[14:09:38] <Lucchia> And the accordion is set to be collapsed always, because it's pretty big
[14:09:52] <Lucchia> And I want it to be displayed only when a link with a given ID is displayed
[14:10:06] <robertmaxrees> Lucchia can you make an example using https://jsfiddle.net/ ?
[14:10:16] <Lucchia> Sure
[14:10:17] <taplar> ks: you can console.log(typeof <variable>) to make sure they are all "number"
[14:12:30] <Lucchia> https://jsfiddle.net/superrodris/1u1wdwf4/
[14:12:36] <Lucchia> Here I have the paragraph with the link
[14:12:41] <Lucchia> and below's my accordion code
[14:13:05] <Lucchia> Let me know if something's missing
[14:13:13] <ks> taplar:  like this? https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/13/
[14:14:03] <taplar> you don't need the slice.  and i checked the min, max, and the hotelPrice and it looked like they were all numbers so you don't have to convert anything
[14:15:21] <Lucchia> I have my full accordion here http://codepen.io/mlrodriguez/pen/aNjEKX
[14:15:34] <robertmaxrees> Lucchia that's not how you includde jquery and jquery ui :)
[14:15:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1u1wdwf4/2/
[14:15:42] <robertmaxrees> also: that's not your full accordion.
[14:15:49] <robertmaxrees> mind acutally fleshing that out a bit?
[14:17:29] <ks> taplar:  updated https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/15/
[14:18:04] <Lucchia> Ok
[14:18:19] <Lucchia> https://jsfiddle.net/superrodris/1u1wdwf4/4/
[14:18:22] <Lucchia> That's the whole thing
[14:18:31] <Lucchia> The link I'm trying to get to work is the one that says
[14:18:41] <Lucchia> For more detail on these three methods, check the Excel, CSV, Documents and Images section.
[14:18:48] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[14:18:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use fiddle :)
[14:19:13] <Lucchia> I'm used to Codepen, sorry :S
[14:19:20] <robertmaxrees> then just use that.
[14:19:23] <robertmaxrees> linky to the pen?
[14:19:24] <taplar> ks: more like https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/17/ but for some reason right now the range check is not working unless one of the values matches the min or max so something funky is going on
[14:20:12] <taplar> oh! hah
[14:20:20] <taplar> your passing in the same value as the min and max
[14:20:54] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jz5jga78/20/

[14:22:25] <taplar> what you didn't believe us? ;)
[14:23:13] <ks> taplar:  thanks a lot, and robertmaxrees < kudos, you are real jquery ninjas
[14:24:38] <robertmaxrees> s'what we do.
[14:24:48] <MEGAGHZ> such a lib!

[14:32:44] <codecutter> can you load a local file in jsfiddile, if so how?
[14:33:06] <robertmaxrees> not without opening yourself up to a very dangerous vulnerability.
[14:33:14] <robertmaxrees> need to host it somewhere.
[14:33:27] <codecutter> do you know place?
[14:33:49] <robertmaxrees> is it something you wrote or is it a library or something.
[14:34:09] <codecutter> https://github.com/gestixi/image-scale/blob/master/image-scale.js
[14:34:17] <robertmaxrees> use rawgit for that instead.
[14:34:24] <robertmaxrees> https://rawgit.com/
[14:34:27] <codecutter> it complains
[14:34:31] <codecutter> tried it
[14:34:34] <robertmaxrees> which si why you use rawgit.
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> it fixes that.
[14:34:46] <codecutter> i did try rawgit
[14:35:01] <codecutter> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gestixi/image-scale/master/image-scale.js
[14:35:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cv7tczuf/
[14:35:10] <robertmaxrees> no errors here...

[14:35:34] <codecutter> my bad
[14:35:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:50:22] <luist> hey guys, how can i display this tooltip for only 5 seconds? is there a timeout or something? $(e.trigger).attr('title', 'Copied!’).tooltip('fixTitle').tooltip('show');
[14:50:39] <robertmaxrees> what tooltip lib ar you using?
[14:50:44] <robertmaxrees> *are
[14:55:04] <codecutter> what does this error mean? cover-ui.js:37 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).imageScale is not a function
[14:57:19] <codecutter> is it the function or the selector?
[14:58:52] <Jagst3r15> anyone know why in chrome I get undefined:1 Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a call to pause().
[14:58:55] <luist> robertmaxrees: not a tooltip lib i think… i use clipboard.js to copy stuff to clipboard and theres a success event
[15:01:36] <robertmaxrees> codecutter that means imageScale isn't defined yet.
[15:01:47] <codecutter> i see
[15:01:48] <robertmaxrees> luist you're bringing in something that defines .tooltip.
[15:01:54] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to figure out what that is.
[15:02:10] <luist> robertmaxrees: i use $("#embed-content").tooltip({'placement':'bottom'}); and it works
[15:02:20] <robertmaxrees> luist yeah, there's a library defining .tooltip()
[15:02:23] <luist> robertmaxrees: maybe i can define durations the native way
[15:02:29] <luist> oh
[15:02:36] <robertmaxrees> codecutter you usually get that when you run your code before a plugin is defined.
[15:03:04] <Jagst3r15> :/
[15:03:39] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 search google?
[15:04:18] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 http://stackoverflow.com/a/36898221
[15:04:50] <codecutter> Here is my script i can't seem to figure out what is causing problem at line 36 (function is part of the image-scale)
[15:05:04] <codecutter> http://pastebin.com/fNQeNckf
[15:05:32] <robertmaxrees> codecutter image-scale may not play well with require.
[15:05:54] <robertmaxrees> might need to use a shim.
[15:06:07] <codecutter> it appears so... whats the fix?
[15:06:14] <robertmaxrees> "might need to use a shim."
[15:06:38] <codecutter> you mean require shim?
[15:06:42] <codecutter> let me try that
[15:06:48] <robertmaxrees> a shim in require, yes.
[15:08:55] <codecutter> added the following      require('bower_components/es5-shim/es5-shim');
[15:09:01] <codecutter> no luck
[15:09:36] <merced> ./bower_components
[15:09:46] <merced> maybe
[15:11:04] <codecutter> path is ok
[15:44:47] <Vivekkkkk> Hello Guys, can anyone help me with this question ? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36943082/form-displayed-using-jquery-submits-successfully-but-no-submit-response?noredirect=1#comment61450639_36943082    any help would be greatly appreciated
[15:45:05] <robertmaxrees> codecutter that's not what i meant.
[15:45:15] <robertmaxrees> codecutter http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html#shimconfig
[15:46:35] <robertmaxrees> Vivekkkkk that's a lot to read - what's the question?
[15:49:24] <Vivekkkkk> robertmaxrees: hmm, basically I want to display form on http://formrnd.byteck.com/test-form/  to http://form.byteck.com I am using ajax to get source code from http://formrnd.byteck.com/test-form/  and putting it on forms.byteck.com , form takes input but the response is not shown. ( like whether submitted successfully or not )
[15:49:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:50:10] <Vivekkkkk> for those who joined late, question is , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36943082/form-displayed-using-jquery-submits-successfully-but-no-submit-response?noredirect=1#comment61450639_36943082
[15:50:19] <robertmaxrees> that question doesn't really make sense.
[15:50:21] <robertmaxrees> it's not clear.
[15:51:19] <Vivekkkkk> robertmaxrees: how ? I just want to put some html from one site to another using ajax, whats wrong ?
[15:51:29] <robertmaxrees> okay, that makes more sense.
[15:51:43] <robertmaxrees> so which page are you grabbing HTML from?
[15:52:26] <Vivekkkkk> its http://formrnd.byteck.com/test-form/
[15:52:39] <robertmaxrees> 'okay.  so you want to display the html from that page on another page - what's the other page?
[15:53:01] <Vivekkkkk> that other page is http://forms.byteck.com
[15:53:19] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so http://forms.byteck.com/ uses ajax to pull the contents of http://formrnd.byteck.com/test-form/ onto it, right?
[15:53:31] <Vivekkkkk> yes exactly
[15:53:41] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so that part works.
[15:53:47] <robertmaxrees> so what's the bug?
[15:54:16] <robertmaxrees> that the ajax handler for the form doesn't work?
[15:54:27] <Vivekkkkk> the bug is that there is a contact form on http://formrnd.byteck.com/test-form/ which is working properly on http://formrnd.byteck.com/test-form/, but not on http://forms.byteckcom
[15:55:02] <Vivekkkkk> yes the confirmation for form submission is not shown on http://forms.byteck.com
[15:55:12] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:55:18] <robertmaxrees> because you're not including any of that javascrpt.
[15:55:41] <robertmaxrees> or at least it's not binding - which menas it's not loading or running.
[15:55:43] <Vivekkkkk> those javascripts will be included I guess
[15:55:52] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing this like this?
[15:56:03] <robertmaxrees> why not just duplicate the page server-side?
[15:56:20] <robertmaxrees> or route so that those urls go to the same page?
[15:56:46] <Vivekkkkk> because I want to use forms on static sites ( those sites which don't have php or anything running, only static )
[15:56:58] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:57:30] <robertmaxrees> why?  why not just require that they include html + js + css?
[15:58:53] <Vivekkkkk> hmm ? I am not getting you. I want to use forms on static sites which don't have php support. hence I am including form from other page which has static support using ajax
[15:59:12] <robertmaxrees> static sites can use html.
[15:59:29] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: that did. th dude
[15:59:32] <codecutter> thx*
[15:59:36] <codecutter> did it*
[15:59:43] <robertmaxrees> codecutter awesome! :)
[15:59:59] <robertmaxrees> Vivekkkkk so instead of trying to use ajax to copy things over, you just make them include html, js, and css.
[16:00:24] <Vivekkkkk> yes but what about form submit action ?  robertmaxrees
[16:00:30] <robertmaxrees> your javascript handles that.
[16:00:38] <robertmaxrees> you wire that all up like you did before
[16:01:04] <Vivekkkkk> I mean there should be some php that handles mail such things robertmaxrees
[16:01:12] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:01:18] <robertmaxrees> what?
[16:01:27] <robertmaxrees> the ajax thing your doing doesn't change taht part.
[16:01:33] <robertmaxrees> unless you're trying to submit back to your server.
[16:02:02] <robertmaxrees> in which case, you need to use ajax to submit to the proper location.
[16:02:12] <robertmaxrees> and make sure that particular endpoint is opened up for CORS.
[16:02:25] <Vivekkkkk> CORS is open
[16:02:30] <robertmaxrees> then you're fine.
[16:02:34] <robertmaxrees> the other site doesn't need php.
[16:05:03] <Vivekkkkk> robertmaxrees:  it will still not work
[16:05:07] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:05:11] <Vivekkkkk> see the new code at http://forms.byteck.com/new.html
[16:05:30] <Vivekkkkk> I have just copied the source code of  http://formrnd.byteck.com/test-form/
[16:05:40] <robertmaxrees> so what's broken now?
[16:05:58] <Vivekkkkk> the form is not working mate
[16:06:06] <robertmaxrees> the submit is working.
[16:06:10] <robertmaxrees> where's the relevant javascript?
[16:06:19] <Vivekkkkk> submit is not working
[16:06:33] <robertmaxrees> my network tab says differently :)
[16:06:35] <Vivekkkkk> is it giving you response on successfull submit ?
[16:06:42] <robertmaxrees> the ajax post works.
[16:06:56] <robertmaxrees> where's the javascript that handles the ajax?
[16:07:23] <Vivekkkkk> http://formrnd.byteck.com/wp-content/plugins/contact-form-7/includes/js/scripts.js
[16:07:29] <robertmaxrees> where in there is it?
[16:07:46] <Vivekkkkk> its included, you can see the sourcecode
[16:07:47] <robertmaxrees> success: $.wpcf7AjaxSuccess, ?
[16:07:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to read hundreds of lines of code, duder :)
[16:08:03] <robertmaxrees> throw me a bone here.
[16:08:43] <Vivekkkkk> can't you just search for your text using Control + F ?
[16:08:48] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:08:52] <Vivekkkkk> btw wait I will tell you line number
[16:08:52] <robertmaxrees> what am i searching for?
[16:09:02] <robertmaxrees> .then()? .done()?  success: ?
[16:09:47] <Vivekkkkk> $.wpcf7AjaxSuccess this one ?
[16:09:56] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea how any of this code is wired up.
[16:10:02] <robertmaxrees> is that the success handler?
[16:10:38] <Vivekkkkk> it is on line no 27 and 79,,http://formrnd.byteck.com/wp-content/plugins/contact-form-7/includes/js/scripts.js
[16:10:52] <samsagaz> guys, i have an Object { json_list: Array[19] } i need to create two grids with it, i need to "filter" using an datafield named "location" all my object have just two locations, understand my question?
[16:10:53] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  thanks!
[16:11:09] <samsagaz> (sorry for my english)
[16:13:40] <Vivekkkkk> robertmaxrees: have you gave up ?
[16:13:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:13:44] <Vivekkkkk> :)
[16:13:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm doing free work for you buddy.
[16:13:57] <robertmaxrees> be a little patient ;)
[16:14:01] <Vivekkkkk> ;)
[16:14:07] <robertmaxrees> so the init isn't working correctly.
[16:14:15] <robertmaxrees> the success handler isn't bound at all.
[16:14:21] <Vivekkkkk> I was not impatient, I was just curious
[16:14:46] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('div.wpcf7 > form').length) - try running this before you do $('div.wpcf7 > form').wpcf7InitForm();
[16:14:49] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[16:16:50] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:16:54] <robertmaxrees> you're getting an error.
[16:17:02] <robertmaxrees> dataType: 'json', is wrong.
[16:17:13] <robertmaxrees> <textarea>{"mailSent":false,"into":"#wpcf7-f4-p5-o1","captcha":null,"message":"One or more fields have an error. Please check and try again.","invalids":[{"into":"span.wpcf7-form-control-wrap.your-email","message":"The e-mail address entered is invalid.","idref":null}]}</textarea>
[16:17:16] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a valid response.
[16:17:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to fix whatever is generating the response.
[16:17:35] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't have textareas around it.
[16:17:49] <Vivekkkkk> hmm
[16:18:02] <Vivekkkkk> its a very well known plugin for wordpress
[16:18:08] <robertmaxrees> good for it?
[16:18:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm telling you what's causing the error :)
[16:19:12] <Vivekkkkk> I am not sure where and how you're getting that error
[16:19:23] <robertmaxrees> my debugger.
[16:19:29] <Vivekkkkk> btw i am really new to JavaScript Ajax and all
[16:19:34] <robertmaxrees> if you look at the ajax config, it says it's expecting json.
[16:19:42] <robertmaxrees> but the response is wrapped in <textarea> tags.
[16:19:45] <robertmaxrees> which is breaking it.
[16:19:48] <robertmaxrees> so you're getting an error.
[16:20:25] <robertmaxrees> my guess is that using the formbuilder thing is causing you headaches when trying to use it on different sites.  why do you want to generate via php?
[16:20:37] <robertmaxrees> and if you really need this, just use an iframe or something.
[16:21:11] <Vivekkkkk> there are many restrictions on iframe, can't apply css in iframe
[16:21:17] <Vivekkkkk> also mobile device
[16:21:25] <Vivekkkkk> responsive issue
[16:23:15] <robertmaxrees> so then this form builder is not the right solution for what you need.
[16:23:57] <Vivekkkkk> okay
[16:24:13] <Vivekkkkk> thanks for help
[16:24:48] <Vivekkkkk> bye
[16:34:07] <alket> hi, how do I do something like this: $(this+" tr").each...
[16:34:20] <merced> $("tr",this)
[16:35:42] <alket> merced, is not working :(
[16:36:07] <merced> whats this?
[16:37:32] <alket> $("tr",this).each(function( index ) {
[16:37:41] <alket> I am trying to find each tr in the table
[16:37:49] <alket> but from the same table it was clicked
[16:38:24] <merced> try $(this).find('tr').each
[16:39:58] <alket> merced, doesn't work :(, tried it before
[16:40:27] <merced> pastebin me your code
[16:42:35] <alket> merced, http://paste.ubuntu.com/16135413/
[16:44:12] <merced> well, that should work
[16:45:34] <alket> it works with just $("tr").each
[16:46:38] <merced> console.log(this)
[16:59:55] <alket> merced, logs nothing
[17:04:33] <adamsilver> How can I determine the current select when I use multiple id selectors with .change(function () {?
[17:04:56] <adamsilver> **current selector
[17:05:47] <NoiseEee> presumably it's this?
[17:06:07] <NoiseEee> or you can .. function(e) { var el = $(e.target);  }   ?
[17:07:40] <adamsilver> NoiseEee: thank you, that worked
[17:08:38] <Jagst3r15> Hi, anyone have any idea why the code from lines 88 to 104 (http://pastebin.com/eHHXvZCh) would not fire each time a new slide is loaded? When I click on the curbside-consult on a new slide it plays the previous slides video
[17:08:41] <Jagst3r15> that is really odd
[17:11:01] <Jagst3r15> I can't figure it out :/
[17:14:59] <NoiseEee> whats a slide?
[17:15:10] <NoiseEee> are 'new slides' being added after this script has run?
[17:19:07] <Jagst3r15> I think something may be wrong
[17:19:28] <Jagst3r15> NoiseEee I think I need those lines after the else on line 58 as well
[17:19:48] <Jagst3r15> because otherwise it won't fire the main-video-wrapper's video when it iterates to the next one
[17:20:11] <NoiseEee> try to reduce it and make a fiddle
[17:21:04] <Jagst3r15> but does that make sense what I said?
[17:22:38] <NoiseEee> are you literally searching for a class that is name true  and a class named false Jagst3r15 ?
[17:22:45] <Jagst3r15> yes
[17:23:01] <Jagst3r15> that class name is spit out in php
[17:23:08] <Jagst3r15> based on a conditional
[17:23:10] <NoiseEee> well its impossible  to know whats going on without error messages in the console etc
[17:23:35] <Jagst3r15> well what happens is that each slide should have a case-video
[17:24:06] <Jagst3r15> it fires on load and plays that first main video then the quiz pops up, but when you pick true, it should go to the next case video, but it skips directly to the questions slide
[17:24:11] <Jagst3r15> so my logic is screwed up
[17:24:31] <Jagst3r15> you can see the case video stuff around line 79
[17:24:43] <NoiseEee> i recommend debugging, its difficult to assist you with such a large script and being blind
[17:24:44] <Jagst3r15> but I think we need to tie that back into lines 58 or something..
[17:24:52] <NoiseEee> and not getting any error console msgs
[17:25:02] <Jagst3r15> well i dont think its an error
[17:25:07] <Jagst3r15> i think my logic is just wrong
[17:25:12] <NoiseEee> ok :)
[17:25:33] <Jagst3r15> the problem is when i click on that consult button
[17:25:43] <Jagst3r15> it plays the consult video from the first slide
[17:25:51] <Jagst3r15> not from the current active-slide
[17:26:10] <Jagst3r15> my head is gonna explode :(
[17:26:26] <NoiseEee> debug, man
[17:26:36] <NoiseEee> stop and step through the code
[17:26:40] <NoiseEee> see where the logic goes wrong
[17:26:55] * taplar head exploding, surprisingly not the #1 cause of programmer death
[17:27:39] <NoiseEee> https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tut_debugging @ Jagst3r15
[17:28:02] <NoiseEee> thats awful but there are good resource s out there on debugging / setting break points
[17:28:19] <NoiseEee> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging @ Jagst3r15
[17:28:23] <NoiseEee> ^^ much better
[17:28:55] <NoiseEee> https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/breakpoints/add-breakpoints?hl=en
[17:28:56] <NoiseEee> etc
[17:29:04] <NoiseEee> man they need to consolidate all that stuff
[17:30:12] <taplar> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[17:31:53] <Jagst3r15> i'm trying lol
[17:31:54] <Jagst3r15> struggling
[17:32:38] <NoiseEee> later folks!
[17:36:29] <Jagst3r15> anyone else have any idea?
[17:46:02] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/x1ha09o6/ so the video does start playing?
[17:46:29] <Jagst3r15> taplar I think the problem is here: http://pastebin.com/pPn043VM
[17:46:37] <Jagst3r15> the case-video does not play after you answer true
[17:47:12] <taplar> that block should only run once
[17:47:24] <taplar> and ftw you really don't need the each
[17:47:27] <taplar> *fyi
[17:47:30] <Jagst3r15> ok
[17:47:33] <Jagst3r15> thanks
[17:47:45] <taplar> slides.eq(0).addClass...
[17:48:07] <Jagst3r15> i think the issue is maybe on line 59 then
[17:48:52] <Jagst3r15> when it goes to the next case-slide it is not firing the code that runs like it does when you first visit the site
[17:49:08] <taplar> right, it wouldn't the way you have it
[17:49:17] <Jagst3r15> thus the case video is not playing and it skips directly to the quesiton list
[17:49:30] <Jagst3r15> i've been going nuts trying to figure out where the lapse in my logic is
[17:49:57] <Jagst3r15> do you have any idea?
[17:50:37] <taplar> so one thing that is striking me is that your doing a binding (ln 42 in the fiddle i linked) inside an event handler
[17:50:55] <Jagst3r15> yeah
[17:51:01] <taplar> there's potential there for double binding
[17:51:09] <Jagst3r15> oh
[17:51:14] <Jagst3r15> is that causing this issue?
[17:51:17] <Jagst3r15> or a seperate one
[17:51:21] <taplar> unless they can't click the same question list li more than once
[17:51:32] <Jagst3r15> they can
[17:51:38] <taplar> so yeah you got a problem there
[17:51:48] <Jagst3r15> crap
[17:52:01] <Jagst3r15> is that casuing the case video not to play?
[17:52:03] <Jagst3r15> or is that another issue
[17:52:23] <taplar> can't tell with out a working example of the issue.  but double bindings will the majority of the time cause issues
[17:53:05] <Jagst3r15> :/
[17:53:15] <Jagst3r15> to make a working example would take a while haha
[17:53:39] <taplar> just stating it.  i can only look at the logic as it is
[17:54:03] <Jagst3r15> are you sure the double binding may cause that?
[17:54:12] <Jagst3r15> I think I am literally just missing some logic after line 59
[17:54:16] <Jagst3r15> when it goes to the next slide
[17:54:54] <taplar> are you seeing any of your logs repeated multiple times when they should not?  you have a couple in there in that binding doing the activeIndex and a couple other messages
[17:56:21] <Jagst3r15> The video is not playing shows up twice
[17:56:28] <taplar> :)
[17:57:11] <taplar> wait, the ln 21 one?
[17:57:49] <Jagst3r15> taplar yes
[17:58:00] <Jagst3r15> but that doesn't explain why the case-video isn't playing
[17:58:08] <taplar> ok, so that could just be both the videos are ending
[17:58:17] <Jagst3r15> yeah
[17:58:32] <taplar> do you see the 'video has ended' any where?
[17:59:11] <Jagst3r15> yes it triggers as expected when the question's corresponding video has ended
[18:00:51] <taplar> put a console log in the else of that one.  see if you ever see it log
[18:01:01] <Jagst3r15> in which else?
[18:01:12] <taplar> ln 49
[18:01:37] <Jagst3r15> line 49 only trigges when there are no slides left
[18:01:47] <Jagst3r15> that is the concluding video and that is working
[18:01:49] <taplar> right i want to confirm that it is firing
[18:01:54] <Jagst3r15> ok 1 sec
[18:02:14] <Jagst3r15> yes
[18:02:17] <Jagst3r15> I see "The concluding video should be showing"
[18:02:32] <taplar> i wonder something
[18:03:09] <Jagst3r15> what's that
[18:03:11] <taplar> ok, i believe ln 46 is wrong
[18:03:35] <taplar> are all of these case-slide's siblings?
[18:03:42] <Jagst3r15> yes
[18:03:50] <taplar> dang, lol, so that's fine, -_-
[18:03:59] <Jagst3r15> yeah
[18:04:02] <Jagst3r15> that actually works
[18:04:04] <taplar> and they are the only siblings in their parent
[18:04:07] <Jagst3r15> the class changes when it iterates up
[18:04:23] <Jagst3r15> it adds active-slide
[18:04:28] <Jagst3r15> to the next one
[18:04:46] <Jagst3r15> I am pretty sure the error is in the else on 58
[18:04:57] <Jagst3r15> are we missing logic to fire the next case-slide's video>
[18:05:12] <taplar> ok, so throw that in there
[18:06:19] <Jagst3r15> throw video.get(0).play(); in there>
[18:06:21] <Jagst3r15> ?*
[18:06:53] <taplar> does changing the active slide update the player to be the right video?
[18:07:26] <Jagst3r15> in the markup?
[18:07:33] <taplar> the dom
[18:07:57] <taplar> you can throw that play in there, but it may be the wrong video unless your updating it some where else in the logic
[18:08:30] <taplar> or are there multiple videos?
[18:08:36] <taplar> '.case-video'
[18:08:46] <Jagst3r15> yes there are
[18:08:53] <taplar> ah
[18:08:57] <Jagst3r15> when i throw video.get(0).play(); in there it plays the first one!
[18:09:04] <Jagst3r15> but not the current active slide's one
[18:09:05] <Jagst3r15> -_-
[18:09:08] <taplar> yeah you gotta get the one related to your active index
[18:09:12] <Jagst3r15> crap!
[18:09:36] <Jagst3r15> hmm how would I achieve that? in an if statement?
[18:09:49] <taplar> video.get(this is the index no?).play()
[18:10:12] <Jagst3r15> I put activeIndex in there?
[18:10:43] <taplar> +1 since you adjusted your active slide no?
[18:11:00] <Jagst3r15> crap you are right
[18:11:02] <Jagst3r15> let me test it
[18:11:10] <taplar> which you should probably remove it from the old one also
[18:11:32] <Jagst3r15> hmm
[18:11:34] <Jagst3r15> I get TypeError: t.get(e+1).play is not a function. (In 't.get(e+1).play()', 't.get(e+1).play' is undefined)
[18:11:43] <Jagst3r15> when I use video.get(activeIndex +1).play();
[18:12:16] <taplar> try video.last().get().play()
[18:12:48] <Jagst3r15> no luck
[18:12:49] <Jagst3r15> :/
[18:12:58] <taplar> dunno about that then
[18:13:00] <Jagst3r15> TypeError: t.last().get().play is not a function. (In 't.last().get().play()', 't.last().get().play' is undefined)
[18:13:52] <taplar> console.log( video.last().get() )
[18:15:49] <Jagst3r15> 1 sec taplar
[18:16:47] <Jagst3r15> taplar I get [<div class="js-media-player plyr case-video plyr--video plyr--stopped">]
[18:16:54] <taplar> :)
[18:17:08] <taplar> so you have case-video on things that are not videos
[18:17:22] <taplar> is that the case?
[18:17:52] <taplar> what is console.log( video.first().get() ); ?
[18:18:05] <Jagst3r15> crap
[18:18:29] <Jagst3r15> the generic video class is case-video
[18:18:42] <Jagst3r15> the main videos only have the class of main-video
[18:20:44] <Jagst3r15> taplar does that help at all?
[18:21:00] <taplar> try logging the first of the video
[18:21:07] <Jagst3r15> k 1 esc
[18:21:41] <Jagst3r15> [<video class="main-video case-video">] (1)
[18:21:56] <taplar> yeah that makes more sense
[18:22:40] <taplar> ok for your video selector on ln 79 change it to 'video.case-video'
[18:23:06] <Jagst3r15> k
[18:23:12] <Jagst3r15> what about video.main-video?
[18:23:30] <taplar> if that matches all the videos that you are concerned about, sure
[18:23:42] <Jagst3r15> yea it does
[18:24:07] <Jagst3r15> holy crap
[18:24:12] <Jagst3r15> video.get(activeIndex + 1).play(); works
[18:24:16] <taplar> :)
[18:24:18] <Jagst3r15> when I change it to main-video
[18:24:26] <taplar> cause now your trying to play an actual video instead of a div, ;)
[18:25:13] <Jagst3r15> i didnt even change it to video.main-video though
[18:25:29] <taplar> that's fine so long as that class is only on video elements
[18:25:33] <Jagst3r15> because main-video is the video class
[18:25:34] <Jagst3r15> yeah
[18:26:57] <Jagst3r15> taplar I can hear the video playing but cant see it
[18:26:58] <Jagst3r15> damnit
[18:28:58] <taplar> console.log( $('.question-video').length, $('.main-video').length );
[18:29:26] <Jagst3r15> where?
[18:29:43] <taplar> any where
[18:29:56] <taplar> heck, throw it in your console
[18:31:07] <Jagst3r15> I get 9 and 2
[18:31:38] <taplar> so that's possibly an issue
[18:31:54] <Jagst3r15> well
[18:32:01] <taplar> another thing, the videos your trying to play, are they a child of the case-slide?
[18:32:35] <Jagst3r15> If you check this https://jsfiddle.net/y6v8m1Lc/1/
[18:32:50] <Jagst3r15> don't I need stuff like on lines 39 down
[18:33:03] <Jagst3r15> 33 down
[18:33:04] <Jagst3r15> sorry
[18:33:26] <taplar> no clue, maybe
[18:33:45] <Jagst3r15> I dont think this is a thing tho: ideo.get(activeIndex + 1).on('ended',function(){
[18:34:02] <Jagst3r15> video.get(activeIndex + 1).on('ended',function(){
[18:34:04] <Jagst3r15> *
[18:34:12] <Jagst3r15> TypeError: t.get(e+1).on is not a function. (In 't.get(e+1).on', 't.get(e+1).on' is undefined)
[18:34:26] <taplar> no cause your breaking out of the jquery object
[18:34:34] <taplar> use eq instead of get in that instance
[18:34:53] <taplar> but again, is the video you are trying to play a child of your active slide?
[18:34:54] <Jagst3r15> video.eq(activeIndex + 1).on('ended',function(){ ?
[18:35:00] <taplar> yes
[18:41:15] <Jagst3r15> that works taplar
[18:41:16] <Jagst3r15> (:
[18:41:31] <taplar> cool
[18:42:07] <taplar> you still haven't answered my q though, :P
[18:42:17] <Jagst3r15> what was that
[18:42:28] <taplar> is the video you want to play a child of the active slide
[18:42:44] <Jagst3r15> it is a div within an li
[18:42:51] <Jagst3r15> where the li is the active-slide
[18:42:57] <taplar> so yes
[18:42:59] <taplar> lol
[18:43:20] <taplar> so to reference it you could just do $('.active-slide').find('.main-video')
[18:43:26] <taplar> not index needed
[18:43:29] <taplar> *no
[18:43:29] <Jagst3r15> oh
[18:43:47] <Jagst3r15> well there is one more issue, the stupid curbside consult video plays when it goes to the next video
[18:43:49] <Jagst3r15> https://jsfiddle.net/y6v8m1Lc/2/
[18:44:15] <Jagst3r15> I try to hide it on 54
[18:44:37] <Jagst3r15> but it it showing while the new main-video is playing underneath it
[18:45:31] <taplar> are you seeing the concluding video should be showing message log again?
[18:47:19] <Jagst3r15> taplar i see the console but the video is set to display none
[18:47:27] <Jagst3r15> not by me
[18:47:52] <taplar> if your seeing that log after your logging for the else, then your handler is processing again
[18:48:12] <Jagst3r15> what do you mean
[18:48:23] <taplar> did you take out the logging for the else block?
[18:48:41] <Jagst3r15> the concluding video plays taplar
[18:48:46] <Jagst3r15> i jsut cant see it
[18:48:49] <taplar> that's not the else block
[18:50:10] <Jagst3r15> taplar what do you mean
[18:50:17] <taplar> else { this is an else block }
[18:50:28] <Jagst3r15> on line 50?
[18:50:35] <taplar> yes, do you have any logging in that?
[18:51:14] <Jagst3r15> no what should i add
[18:51:31] <KataiKou> I'm having trouble messing with dynamic elements in jquery.  My website basically reads a remote file, formats it (converts it into html, essentially), and writes it into a div.  Now I want to be able to jump to a specific line (using scrollIntoView?), however $("#line30") doesn't return any elements to scroll to, since they were dynamically created
[18:51:33] <taplar> dunno, something like console.log('advancing to next video')
[18:51:39] <KataiKou> I'm not sure what I can do
[18:51:47] <taplar> see if you see that and then the concluding log before the concluding log should show
[18:52:10] <taplar> KataiKou: when are you doing that selector?
[18:52:31] <Jagst3r15> taplar advancing to next video shows
[18:52:58] <Jagst3r15> and so does The concluding video should be showing
[18:53:06] <KataiKou> taplar: $("#log_panel").append(myDiv);   console.log( $("#line30"));
[18:53:08] <taplar> it logs when it should log?
[18:53:40] <taplar> KataiKou: that's in your success callback of whatever is getting the file with ajax?
[18:53:54] <KataiKou> taplar: yes, this is all within the callback
[18:54:03] <taplar> should work then, :S
[18:54:31] <KataiKou> what should work?  I can't access the element
[18:54:40] <KataiKou> Object { context: HTMLDocument → logs.html, selector: "#line30" } <-- there's nothing in here
[18:54:56] <Jagst3r15> taplar the issue is that the consult video shows when you advance to the next slide, but that should be hidden and only shown when you click on the curbside-consult button
[18:54:57] <taplar> what do you get if you console.log( $('#log_panel').length );
[18:55:32] <KataiKou> taplar: I get 1
[18:55:56] <taplar> ok, and what do you get for logging the 'myDiv'?  if it's fairly large, put it in a fiddle or something
[18:56:43] <Jagst3r15> I don't think jQuery('.curbside-consult-wrap').hide(0); is working :S
[18:57:05] <taplar> Jagst3r15: you really don't need the zero, but i wouldn't think that would be killing it
[18:58:39] <KataiKou> taplar: I get pretty much what I put into the myDiv
[18:58:54] <taplar> can i see?
[18:59:46] <Jagst3r15> taplar the damn thing adds a display: block inline so I don't think my jQuery('.curbside-consult-wrap').hide(); is working
[19:00:20] <taplar> Jagst3r15: then something is unhiding it.  hide() puts an inline display:none
[19:00:35] <Jagst3r15> hmm
[19:03:09] <Jagst3r15> found it taplar haha
[19:04:30] <taplar> cool
[19:04:57] <Jagst3r15> thank you
[19:05:16] <taplar> np, glad i could poke at the code, :)
[19:06:28] <Jagst3r15> my head is swimming
[19:07:00] <taplar> only other things i might say is your logic could possibly be a little cleaner looking if you put it in an iife so you could use $ instead of jQuery.  but aside from that, your doing the same jQuery(...) repeated in a few places.  storing those in a var and reusing those could get you a little performance boost
[19:07:23] <Jagst3r15> yeah
[19:07:24] <Jagst3r15> I agree
[19:08:18] <arc_> in most cases i'm not really worried about the performance aspect of that, it just makes the code more readable
[19:08:41] <taplar> i'm always mindful of how many times i'm hitting the dom, :)
[19:08:57] <arc_> ya i mean obviously you may as well
[19:09:21] <Jagst3r15> taplar in chrome I get a weird issue
[19:09:24] <Jagst3r15> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36803176/how-to-prevent-the-play-request-was-interrupted-by-a-call-to-pause-error
[19:09:40] <Jagst3r15> any idea why the video playback would break like that, i found that but am not sure how to resolve
[19:09:53] <Jagst3r15> i pooped this open in chrome and when you click in the video or pause it rbeaks
[19:10:36] <taplar> no clue about any of that.  haven't messed with videos really
[19:12:06] <taplar> though that last comment on the OP links to an open chrome ticket on it
[19:12:27] <Jagst3r15> yeah
[19:12:33] <Jagst3r15> so do you think it is something I need to fix
[19:12:36] <Jagst3r15> or a chrome bug?
[19:12:51] <taplar> looks like a chrome bug.  doesn't happen in ff?
[19:12:59] <Jagst3r15> no or safari or opera
[19:13:26] <taplar> how urgent is it that you get this out to production?
[19:13:43] <taplar> and do you have any idea of the % of your users that use chrome?
[19:16:59] <taplar> either way if you want to try a work around until they patch chrome, that issue is related to using one of the vanilla js methods, so you might find more support for that in #javascript
[19:18:48] <taplar> or ##javascript i forget which it is
[19:19:28] <Jagst3r15> hey taplar, one last little thing, I fixed everything except the chrome issue and an issue where the curbside video button plays the previos slides video
[19:19:33] <Jagst3r15> here is the latest code: https://jsfiddle.net/p43zvnaq/1/
[19:19:53] <Jagst3r15> I think it has something to do with 110-115
[19:21:02] <taplar> how many curbside-consult's are there?
[19:21:08] <Jagst3r15> one per slide
[19:21:30] <taplar> your always getting the first one
[19:21:36] <Jagst3r15> oh :/
[19:22:05] <taplar> what's the relation of the curbside-consult to the curbside-video?
[19:22:43] <taplar> and think in terms of parent, (nested) child, sibling, etc
[19:23:37] <Jagst3r15> let me see
[19:24:48] <Jagst3r15> curbside-video is the video class
[19:25:07] <Jagst3r15> and the curbside consult button is outside of the curbside consult wrap
[19:25:13] <Jagst3r15> down in another div
[19:25:23] <taplar> do they have a shared parent?
[19:26:01] <Jagst3r15> no
[19:26:31] <Jagst3r15> taplar well yes, case-slide
[19:26:36] <taplar> ok
[19:27:02] <taplar> so you can find your video with $(this).closest('.case-slide').find('.curbside-video')
[19:27:13] <taplar> get it?
[19:27:27] <Jagst3r15> where would that go
[19:27:42] <taplar> inside 111-114
[19:27:57] <taplar> your wanting to play the curbside video related to the consult you clicked
[19:28:17] <taplar> anything in that block that is contextual to the consult that you clicked, you need to do something like that
[19:28:34] <taplar> global lookups like ln 113 are going to find too much crap
[19:28:35] <Jagst3r15> should I set var curbsideVideo to that?
[19:28:44] <taplar> yep yep
[19:37:48] <Jagst3r15> works
[19:37:49] <Jagst3r15> thanks taplar
[19:37:55] <taplar> cool
[19:37:56] <Jagst3r15> im gonna have some beers now
[19:37:59] <taplar> lol
[19:38:16] <Jagst3r15> learned a lot
[19:38:18] <Jagst3r15> thank you
[19:38:25] <taplar> good deal.
[19:45:38] <taplar> heh, i'm surprised you didn't bust me on the your again Uhkis
