[03:15:56] <deez_nuts> hi there
[03:17:00] <deez_nuts> ill have a function which gets several queries from a datastore and does something when it resolves
[03:18:04] <deez_nuts> so it is this.query("blabla").then(function(resolvedObject){ doSomething... })
[03:18:13] <deez_nuts> so now this is wrapped in a for loop
[03:18:25] <deez_nuts> because there are several different queries
[03:18:54] <deez_nuts> how can i get rid of the "Don't make functions within a loop."
[03:19:26] <deez_nuts> problem is basically just how can i call a function in the then part with a parameter ?
[03:28:22] <deez_nuts> how can i transform this.getPromise.then(function (something){
[03:28:59] <deez_nuts> into something like this.getPromise.then(myfunction(something))...
[03:40:43] <kenaniah> I’ve got a site running jQuery 2.2.4. Exact same site is deployed to two different domains. Servers return the same response headers for a request, both have the same SSL cert, but one of the sites apparently doesn’t have AJAX support — at all. Literally, $.support.ajax == false. What would cause AJAX support to be completely disabled?
[03:41:31] <kenaniah> Interestingly, both FF and Chrome appear to send a different set of headers to the two different URLs
[05:47:30] <xenaxon> hi
[05:47:51] <xenaxon> I'm having a problem! Trying to use .focus() to focus an input. I'm using the correct id, but it's not focusing
[05:48:01] <xenaxon> can someone tell me what could be wrong?
[05:53:16] <safinn> xenaxon make sure your selector is a string with a hash at the start if its an id like this: `$('#idHere').focus();`
[06:20:02] <safinn> Hope someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong here: http://codepen.io/Safinn/pen/qNpdAO?editors=1010 The animations should stop on hover and resume when the mouse is moved but they start moving at different speeds :(
[06:23:19] <AdamPDotty> looks funny though
[06:24:27] <AdamPDotty> cool effects
[06:26:08] <safinn> broken haha :(
[06:31:38] <AdamPDotty> I lack experience there. Are you sure the resume-function replaces the update-function and does not add on top of it?
[06:32:29] <AdamPDotty> And please do not use the same function over and over again. Use a variable!
[06:36:04] <Clint0n> Hi all, can anyone see anything wrong with this simple dropdown script? http://pastebin.com/XwbfhkKM  - Dropdown isn't working at all and I'm very stumped as all looks good to me. Also tried setting the CSS properties using .css
[06:39:37] <AdamPDotty> so many levels
[06:40:07] <AdamPDotty> first: Use CSS for :hover!
[06:40:38] <AdamPDotty> second: you probably want isVisible() or such
[06:41:23] <AdamPDotty> third: if you use .css(), work with console.log() to check it
[06:42:10] <AdamPDotty> fourth: have a look at .toggle() !
[06:42:36] <Clint0n> Apologies more of a backend dev :D Thanks mate will work through those points
[06:50:10] <codecutter> is there a way to listen if a class is removed from child1 and added to child2?
[06:51:25] <codecutter> http://pastebin.com/f26g2zhw
[06:52:10] <codecutter> tigger not fire if its same link
[06:53:36] <codecutter> nvm
[07:07:10] <PCatinean> hey guys
[07:16:52] <safinn> If I perform an animation and set the translateX value to -1000, will that move the element 1000 pixels to the left from its current position or to the -1000 position on the document?
[07:21:57] <AdamPDotty> well you did not provide the unit px
[07:22:23] <AdamPDotty> I would expect it to be a distance, not a position
[07:27:25] <waterCreature> hi, the toggleClass doesn't seem to be working? https://jsfiddle.net/kgb8u2cv/3/
[07:27:54] <waterCreature> https://jsfiddle.net/kgb8u2cv/4/
[07:28:02] <waterCreature> i mean it doesn't go to blue
[07:46:56] <PCatinean> What is the best selector for "All select inputs that have 3 options out of which one is "x" and another is "y"
[07:46:57] <PCatinean> as a label
[07:47:18] <PCatinean> I've got this far: $('select').has('option:contains("X")').has("option:contains('Y')")
[08:36:04] <krisis> PCatinean: $('select').has('option:contains("X")').has('option:contains("Y")').filter(function (index, element) { return ($(element).children().length === 3)? true: false; });
[08:39:14] <runtyrobot> Quick question - on submit, when I do a serializeArray and JSON.stringify on the the form - I get it out in the form with the name and value seperate - like [{"name":"chip_tag","value":"E2005169651502410490E545"}] -- is it possible to, somehow, get name:value ?
[08:49:03] <taplar> runtyrobot: try using serialize() instead of serializeArray() on the form
[08:49:10] <simbalion> Hi, I'm trying to use fancybox with Wordpress and it appears to be loading, there are no errors in the console, but it's not actually doing anything. Can someone help?
[08:50:56] <taplar> simbalion: you did all this stuff? http://fancybox.net/howto
[08:52:35] <simbalion> taplar: I followed the instructions here: http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/ however I copied the fancybox.js content to my already-loading scripts.js, to reduce load times, and copied the css to my theme's stylesheet. I've tried it loading fancybox.js seperately but that did not make a difference
[08:53:09] <simbalion> I'm loading it in the footer, instead of the header, otherwise I think I followed the instructions to the letter
[08:53:09] <runtyrobot> taplar: It got me closer but I found a serializeObject function which seems to get me there :) Cheers
[08:53:31] <simbalion> I tried loading it in the header as well just for testing but that did not seem to help
[08:54:15] <taplar> simbalion: are you using 'jQuery' instead of '$' with your script as your on wordpress?  or are you running your logic in a jquery closure or an IIFE passing in jQuery as $ ?
[08:55:05] <simbalion> taplar: uh.. I think I'm using jquery closures? I understand how wordpress uses compatibility mode, I'm not seeing any errors about $() not being a function, so I think I did it right
[08:55:22] <taplar> mmm, not sure then.
[08:55:58] <simbalion> taplar: Yeah I'm stumped, this isn't my first time using jquery plugins with wordpress, I dunno why it doesnt work
[08:56:22] <taplar> and you have your logic at the bottom of your page or in a doc ready?
[08:57:25] <taplar> +you've verified that the selector your calling fancybox on has found elements
[08:57:39] <simbalion> Ah, yes that is the last thing loaded in my scripts.js
[08:57:52] <simbalion> the fancybox code is directly before that
[08:58:48] <simbalion> I dunno if the order matters
[08:59:08] <taplar> you want your jquery import, your fancybox import, then your logic
[08:59:53] <taplar> jquery is your base.  fancybox extends it, so it has to come second.
[08:59:59] <taplar> your logic depends on both, so it comes last
[09:00:28] <simbalion> I am telling wordpress to enqueue scripts.js with jquery as a dependency, so it loads jquery, then scripts.js.
[09:00:41] <flyz_> Hey does anybody know how to solve this: http://prntscr.com/bv8e9j error, this is the code: https://bpaste.net/show/58b1e2040246
[09:01:47] <taplar> flyz_: your endpoint server is returning a 500
[09:02:22] <flyz_> yeah but it shouldnt
[09:02:36] <flyz_> when i do a post request via the postman plugin it works perfectly fine
[09:03:10] <taplar> ok, i'm not familiar with that, but if its a browser plugin then you can look at your network tab and see how it makes the request and see how the two are different
[09:06:08] <flyz_> ok ill try..
[09:06:12] <Biganon> Hi ! I have <img> next to each other on my page and they have a little margin between them ; but when I prepend() those images in another div, they get put in the div but with no margin between them
[09:06:40] <Biganon> how can I keep the default image margin style, even with dynamically added elements ?
[09:07:06] <taplar> jquery doesn't change anything like that with dynamic things.  it will be the css you have defined
[09:07:16] <taplar> *doesn't change by default
[09:08:32] <Biganon> weird, it seems I haven't applied any particular styling at all regarding these elements
[09:08:32] <taplar> my guess is your seeing some margin due to whitespace css rules, but I could be wrong.  i'd hit up ##css about it
[09:09:39] <Biganon> ok thanks
[09:10:00] <taplar> most likely a white space issue then
[09:10:19] <taplar> if you have new lines between your markup, your browser can interpret those as white space and put some spacing between
[09:10:28] <taplar> where as an append would put things all together
[09:11:23] <taplar> i know i've ran into that in the past and I either made them all contiguous without any new lines to fix the issue, or i changed the font-size to 0 for text to fix it
[09:11:31] <taplar> but i'm a laymen with css, :)
[09:12:32] <Biganon> ha it seems you're right
[09:25:55] * taplar wonders what ever happened to hellyeah
[09:29:54] <AwkwardCough> hes in a better place
[09:30:03] <AwkwardCough> or on vacation
[09:30:05] <taplar> heh, canada
[09:30:51] <taplar> amsterdam!
[09:30:59] <taplar> which i can't spell
[09:33:45] <Biganon> any way to do something like $(image).fadeOut("slow").appendTo("#galerie").fadeIn("slow"); ?
[09:34:02] <Biganon> have the image fadeOut where it is, THEN be appended somewhere else, then fadeIn
[09:34:14] <Biganon> because with this code my image gets appended immediately
[09:34:17] <taplar> iirc fadeOut should have a complete callback
[09:34:37] <tom_____> Good Afternoon, can anyone tell me why my flot chart is disappearing when it's redrawn? https://jsfiddle.net/hufhu62x/1/
[09:35:12] <taplar> Biganon: https://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/#fadeOut-duration-complete
[09:35:28] <taplar> give fadeOut a function as the second parameter.  do your append and fade in, in there
[09:37:55] <tom_____> Ok nevermind i made it work
[09:37:56] <tom_____> very odd
[09:38:55] <simbalion> taplar: if I load the logic using jQuery(document).ready(function($) I get an error saying fancybox() is not a function, but if I load it using (function($), I don't see any errors, but it doesn't work. Does it matter which one I use?
[09:39:19] <Biganon> taplar: https://dpaste.de/XWbw I tried this, but only the fadeOut works
[09:39:19] <taplar> tom_____: looks like your giving it an array of the method results up top but not in the interval
[09:40:08] <taplar> Biganon: try wrapping $( this )
[09:40:27] <taplar> simbalion: if your logic is at the bottom you don't have to do the ready()
[09:40:50] <Biganon> taplar: thanks it works ! I never know when I have to put $() or not
[09:41:25] <taplar> if your in a callback on a jquery object usually they provide the raw dom element as the 'this'
[09:41:55] <taplar> more often than not, in my opinion, your going to have to wrap 'this' :)
[09:42:09] <tom_____> Ah taplar!
[09:42:13] <taplar> :)
[09:42:21] <tom_____> Thank you
[09:42:53] <simbalion> taplar: thanks
[10:09:31] <simbalion> Can someone tell me why this gives a syntax error?: :not([href*=/wp-admin/])
[10:11:55] <simbalion> nevermind seems it needs to be :not([href*='/wp-admin/']) is all
[10:12:49] <simbalion> however I'm having a different issue I could use help with, if I have $(document).on("click", "a[href^='"+siteUrl+"']:not(.fancybox):not([href*='/wp-admin/']):not([href*=/wp-login.php]):not([href$=/feed/])" the :not(.fancybox) seems to be ignored but if I have $(document).on("click", "a[href^='"+siteUrl+"']:not(.fancybox)" then it works
[10:16:40] <simbalion> ah seems it's better to use .not()
[10:22:48] <Ziberius> hello
[10:23:23] <Ziberius> I'm trying to set an $(".class").on('click',function(){}); on a button i have on all rows in a datatable
[10:23:43] <Ziberius> I execute that after loading the table yet it doesn't register
[10:23:59] <Ziberius> If I execute it manually it works
[10:24:17] <Ziberius> Seems to be a problem of sequence but not sure what is causing it
[10:24:33] <Ziberius> Is there a good way of managing sequential execution in jquery?
[10:34:33] <geoid> greetz
[10:34:35] <geoid> how can I load and parse an HTML string into a sort of virtual DOM (i.e. one that can be manipulated as if it were a DOM but which is not attached to the actual browser window)?
[10:36:21] <Ziberius> geoid: how about using iframe?
[10:37:17] <geoid> like in mootools one would just do: var div = new Element('<div>blah</div>')
[10:37:35] <geoid> then you have a virtual element that you can manipulate using selectors etc.
[10:37:49] <geoid> but it's not attached to the browser's DOM display in any way just yet.
[10:37:55] <taplar> you can do the same with $(htmlString)
[10:38:20] <taplar> what your calling a 'virtual DOM' is a DOM Fragment
[10:48:31] <geoid> taplar tx.. when I try $(htmlString) I get an object back with indexes as keys and the elements as values... so if I do $(htmlString).find('#someid')  it doesn't work
[10:48:58] <taplar> find works on children.  if #someid is a top level element it won't find it
[10:49:55] <taplar> either change it to filter or do something like $('<div />').append(htmlString).find('#someid')
[10:53:06] <PCatinean> krisis, that looks sexy, let me try
[10:53:51] <PCatinean> krisis, wow...worked with the first shot, damn man!
[10:53:56] * PCatinean tips hat
[10:53:58] <PCatinean> thank you sir
[11:09:25] <geoid> taplar that worked thanks!      ... is there a way to cut an element out of that fragment?   e.g. $(htmlString).find('#some_id_inside_fragment').remove(). Is that the right approach?
[12:33:03] <arc_> okay so
[12:33:23] <arc_> say i have like 10,000 divs inside a container div and i want to delete half of them
[12:33:34] <arc_> i can manually find the first div, and i want to delete everything after that
[12:33:41] <arc_> how do i select all that
[12:33:56] <shoky> .nextAll()
[12:34:01] <arc_> o ok lol thx
[12:34:09] <shoky> there's also .nextUntil if that helps
[12:34:23] <arc_> i've used nextuntil before but that doesn't work in this situation
[12:36:50] <lulul> hey guys quick question first time i'm using text/template for a partial section of html. how can I use jquery to load the code from there as html ? I tried with append and .html but withoutluck
[12:37:20] <duch_kazatel> can you show us what you're trying to do lulul?
[12:37:35] <lulul> duch_kazatel: sure thing mate
[12:37:42] <duch_kazatel> rad
[12:40:21] <lulul> https://jsfiddle.net/xca5t58u/
[12:40:22] <lulul> here u go
[12:40:31] <robertmaxrees> woah what
[12:40:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:41:01] <robertmaxrees> why are you escaping your markup like that?
[12:41:19] <lulul> well my markup is generated by symfony
[12:42:14] <robertmaxrees> any way you can make it NOT output escaped like that?
[12:42:45] <lulul> umm I think I escaped it :D
[12:42:55] <lulul> let me see :D
[12:42:59] <robertmaxrees> right, so don't escape it.
[12:43:28] <arc_> got it, thx shoky. this page was performing pretty miserably with all those divs
[12:44:01] <arc_> hate when devs make tables for reports by positioning thousands of divs with css left and top
[12:44:16] <lulul> arc_:  :)))
[12:45:42] <arc_> haha damn it. it doesn't matter because when i hit back, it's back to normal again : (
[12:47:27] <arc_> 'back' within their ui, not the browser back button
[13:02:25] <JD-Robbs> Hi guys, jquery-ui 1.12.0 draggable now resets negative top/left values to "0" every time it is initialised. There's nothing about it in the Changelog and I have no clue how to fix this. Has anyone got an idea? Thanks a bunch! :)
[13:03:27] <robertmaxrees> JD-Robbs is it giving you problems?
[13:03:41] <JD-Robbs> It certainly is :)
[13:03:47] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[13:04:09] <robertmaxrees> since you're asking for a fix but not really showing us what issue you're having :)
[13:04:27] <JD-Robbs> Well, my app requires negative left/top values sometimes for draggable elements/layers on a canvas. Since 1.12.0, however, negative left/top values are reset to "0".
[13:04:57] <JD-Robbs> And the changelog makes no mention of this change of behaviour.
[13:05:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd bet they fixed a bug that now triggered this problem for you.
[13:05:32] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe you're not using containment properly?
[13:06:50] <JD-Robbs> I'm not using the containment option because, otherwise, I wouldn't be able to partially drag my elements outside of the canvas.
[13:07:09] <robertmaxrees> So are you able to create a standalone test case of your problem?
[13:07:28] <JD-Robbs> Good point! I'll throw one together on jsfiddle.
[13:07:31] <robertmaxrees> Awesome :)
[13:20:28] <JD-Robbs> Right, having done that, I realised this was me being super f'ing stupid.  I also wired left/top to a ui-spinner which had "min=0". Shame on me :-/
[13:20:47] <robertmaxrees> :) That's half the reason we have people do the fiddles.
[13:20:53] <robertmaxrees> No reason to be hard on yourself though!
[13:20:57] <robertmaxrees> you figured it out.
[13:21:09] <JD-Robbs> Aye aye, and thanks for putting me on the path :)
[14:01:46] <ChrisBinge> how would I get the value of anything between brackets []? I could use substr() but that wouldn't account for variable length
[14:01:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:02:02] <taplar> '[somethingweeeeee]' ?
[14:02:09] <robertmaxrees> are you still using the single cloumn with a single row to store all of your site data?
[14:02:16] <ChrisBinge> haha hey guys
[14:02:17] <ChrisBinge> nah
[14:02:49] <ChrisBinge> I am using the section as it's own row with the items as values
[14:03:19] <taplar> ok, so each row has a column with json in it?
[14:03:45] <ChrisBinge> not jso
[14:03:49] <ChrisBinge> *json
[14:03:55] <ChrisBinge> array
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:04:09] <taplar> something[key]=blah is in a column?
[14:04:41] <ChrisBinge> yeah
[14:04:46] <taplar> don't do that
[14:04:49] <robertmaxrees> that's not an array fwiw.
[14:04:52] <robertmaxrees> and that's a bad data format.
[14:04:57] <robertmaxrees> the column names should describe the data.
[14:05:23] <ChrisBinge> err it's more like *section name* is the key column in the db
[14:05:28] <taplar> is the 'something' the same for all the pieces?
[14:05:35] <ChrisBinge> and the value is a serialized array
[14:05:50] <taplar> here's the thing
[14:05:57] <taplar> your wanting to get smaller pieces of the data
[14:06:05] <taplar> that is telling you you need to break up the data more
[14:06:13] <taplar> database wise
[14:06:26] <ChrisBinge> so save each input as it's own column?
[14:06:34] <ChrisBinge> err row
[14:06:49] <taplar> if you have a fixed number, columns work
[14:06:58] <ChrisBinge> variable number
[14:07:04] <taplar> if there are a variable number you'd be looking at some sort of reference table
[14:07:10] <robertmaxrees> variable number, but fixed set of options?
[14:07:20] <ChrisBinge> nope variable options
[14:07:25] <robertmaxrees> and by "variable number" you mean a variable number of groups, right?
[14:07:32] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[14:08:37] <ChrisBinge> menus, so for each menu there could be a section for soups + salads and variable items in each section i.e. tomato soup, $8
[14:08:54] <robertmaxrees> is this a menu builder?
[14:09:00] <ChrisBinge> yeah
[14:09:03] <taplar> yeah, i'm seeing multiple tables
[14:09:09] <robertmaxrees> then you're confused about how this works :)
[14:09:13] <taplar> table one, menus
[14:09:21] <taplar> table two, menu options
[14:09:36] <robertmaxrees> there's another menu of groups of options, or "section"
[14:09:38] <taplar> menu one has an id that is on table two's rows to identify which ones go with it
[14:09:52] <robertmaxrees> and you use table three to get your groupIds.
[14:10:08] <robertmaxrees> so you can identify appetizers vs entrées
[14:11:22] <ChrisBinge> right, I've just been trying to do this within the wordpress framework how it is setup, maybe I'll have to look into creating custom tables
[14:11:31] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^
[14:11:51] <robertmaxrees> wordpress was originally a blogging framework.
[14:11:59] <robertmaxrees> which isn't really sufficient for making menus.
[14:12:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:12:38] <ChrisBinge> true, was just hoping I could tweak a few things with the custom meta boxes and make it work
[14:12:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:12:51] <ChrisBinge> MVP haha
[14:14:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:17:41] <taplar> heh, i keep wanting to suggest an article on normal forms, but i'm holding back, :D
[14:17:54] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[14:18:14] <taplar> eh, he appears to be learning the whole rdb concept more
[14:18:29] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[14:18:30] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[14:20:22] <ChrisBinge> i've read a few articles on normal forms, I'm definitely no pro on data structuring, I just was being stubborn trying to mash it into existing wp tables
[14:20:34] <ChrisBinge> love banging my head into walls
[14:23:26] <robertmaxrees> welcome to programming :D
[14:23:35] <akkufomk> Thanks!
[14:23:48] <akkufomk> I like being welcomed to programming

[14:57:09] <_RPG_1> https://jsfiddle.net/yp2r4jja/2/ here it's reproducible at least
[15:05:31] <shoky> _RPG_1:  put  tabindex="-1"  attribute on the dialog <div> element
[15:06:31] <shoky> might work on the <pre> too
[15:06:38] <_RPG_1> shoky: nice trick, thanks! Shouldn't be that documented?
[15:07:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue most folks probably aren't using dialogs like that.
[15:07:33] <robertmaxrees> plus that has more to do with element focus than dialogs themselves :)
[15:07:40] <shoky> yah ^
[15:10:16] <_RPG_1> btw it works only if I click inside dialog
[15:10:23] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:10:27] <robertmaxrees> because of element focus.
[15:12:03] <_RPG_1> tabindex="1" autofocus="true" in pre works for me
[15:12:38] <shoky> should be just autofocus  without ="true"
[15:13:13] <_RPG_1> even without autofocus, just tabindex="1" not -1
[15:14:04] <shoky> yeah the rules for that are documented here  http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[15:14:12] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:14:32] <robertmaxrees> well i'll be.
[15:15:39] <_RPG_1> Ctrl+F "tabindex" == /dev/null
[15:15:52] <shoky> look at the Focus section at the top
[15:16:12] <robertmaxrees> like, scroll down just a little.
[15:16:12] <shoky> they link to :tabbable  which mentions tabindex

[15:35:59] <pr0tocol> hey everyone!
[15:36:04] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[15:37:12] <pr0tocol> this heat isn't making very tolerable, but it's good nontheless.
[15:37:38] <robertmaxrees> we're actually getting a break from our normal summer 110+ temps here :D
[15:37:49] <pr0tocol> i have a question which i hope i can get some assistance with. is there any way of removing a div from a page after it has been loaded if it does not contain an id or a class?
[15:37:59] <pr0tocol> 110+? o_O
[15:38:07] <pr0tocol> that's a bit... high lol
[15:38:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:38:17] <robertmaxrees> and sure. you can do that.
[15:39:47] <pr0tocol> the only info i see loaded on the page is <div style="border:3px solid #F8C868; width: 90%; padding: 5px;">
[15:40:18] <pr0tocol> This div is being loaded from another js file on a server, though. so i'm looking at how we can remove this after the page has already been loaded.
[15:40:20] <robertmaxrees> is there anything about the div that is unique?  some text?  maybe a parent or a specific child?
[15:40:32] <robertmaxrees> .remove() is how you'd remove it.
[15:40:45] <robertmaxrees> selecting it will be the harder part :)
[15:41:32] <pr0tocol> parent div has a class named "maintenance-message"
[15:41:44] <robertmaxrees> is it the only child div of that parent?
[16:14:20] <pr0tocol> hey robertmaxrees sorry about that. had to step away
[16:14:28] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[16:14:44] <pr0tocol> to answer your question, yes. it seems like it's the only child to the parent div
[16:14:51] <robertmaxrees> then target through that parent.
[16:15:10] <robertmaxrees> $('.maintenance-message div').remove()
[16:16:11] <pr0tocol> would i need to specify anything to execute on page load? or would placing this right before </body> suffice?
[16:16:26] <robertmaxrees> so that's the next step: what loads this?
[16:16:39] <robertmaxrees> because "page load" is ephemeral.  you said this is happening from an ajax call, right?
[16:17:34] <pr0tocol> robertmaxrees: looking at it, it seems that this is being loaded from a portion on the index.html. more specifically, <script src=/loing/all-classes.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[16:17:55] <robertmaxrees> so it's just some plain JS injecting it?  no ajax call?
[16:18:19] <robertmaxrees> if that's the case, you want $(window).load(function() {});, though that can take some time to fire.
[16:18:45] <pr0tocol> hrm... when i check the sources in dev tools, looks like a file called "ajaxmaintenanceinfo.js" is responsible for loading the aforemntioned div style
[16:19:03] <robertmaxrees> so why are you trying to remove a maintenance message?
[16:19:23] <pr0tocol> trying to remove the styling around it not necessary the message itself ;)
[16:19:53] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want to remove the message, you just want to modify styling?  there an API or something you can hook into?
[16:20:04] <pr0tocol> there isn't no.
[16:20:10] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[16:20:13] <robertmaxrees> seems strange.
[16:20:28] <pr0tocol> and to answer your question, no, i don't want to remove the message. just modify the styling as you said.
[16:20:55] <robertmaxrees> this seems really odd.  so there's a maintenance message from a third party injecting onto your side and you can't control it?
[16:21:08] <robertmaxrees> that's unusual, but you'll need to look at hooking into the global ajax events.
[16:21:21] <robertmaxrees> no other real way to guarantee you fire at the right time.
[16:22:12] <pr0tocol> right.
[16:22:25] <robertmaxrees> sounds like something you should ditch then.
[16:22:33] <pr0tocol> lol i wish
[16:22:38] <robertmaxrees> why can't you?
[16:22:42] <pr0tocol> it's an internal company tool that i'm using
[16:22:48] <ianertson> isn't Jquery quite bloaty?
[16:23:01] <robertmaxrees> pr0tocol then just update the internal tool's code?
[16:23:13] <robertmaxrees> ianertson *jQuery, and not really.
[16:23:18] <pr0tocol> so what happens is that when i upload a completely finished package onto a production system, the aformentioned file is forced to load onto each package
[16:23:29] <pr0tocol> robertmaxrees: if i had access to it, I 100% would :D
[16:23:40] <robertmaxrees> pr0tocol so you're trying to circumvent an internal tool?
[16:23:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:23:45] <ianertson> Vanilla Javascript <3
[16:23:48] <pr0tocol> robertmaxrees: shhhhhh
[16:23:55] <pr0tocol> :D
[16:24:08] <robertmaxrees> as a developer that has to handle users doing that all the time, please don't.
[16:24:34] <pr0tocol> robertmaxrees: which is why i decided to ask how to override it lol. i'd never do anything like that to begin with
[16:24:40] <pr0tocol> could cause a plethora of other issues
[16:25:08] <robertmaxrees> i mean doing client-side tweaks like you are.
[16:25:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd talk to the devs instead heh
[16:25:31] <pr0tocol> touche
[16:25:49] <robertmaxrees> those kinds of things have a habit of snowballing and causing problems :)
[16:26:20] <pr0tocol> yea -- and i guess i can gauge as to why
[16:27:02] <robertmaxrees> heh.  so do whatcha want, but i'd actualyl speak with your helpdesk or devs or whatever.  something tells me the problem you're really trying to solve isn't the one you're working with right now :D
[16:28:18] <pr0tocol> i'll touch base with devs. the border that they're pushing to the style conflicts with client requests. so a yellow border, for example, won't be aesthetically pleasing to a client who wants no border
[16:29:08] <pr0tocol> i'll definitely take what you're saying as wisdom and not do anything on the client side but, instead, escalate this to the maintainers to at the very least ammend that line in the file so that we can control that portion of the style
[16:29:21] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ that's what you want to do.
[16:29:33] <robertmaxrees> though since it's a maintenance message, a little visual clash might be a good thing :)
[16:31:47] <pr0tocol> robertmaxrees: thanks for that input -- appreciate it
[16:32:00] <robertmaxrees> your devs will thank you :)
[16:39:55] <taplar> robertmaxrees: finally get rain?
[16:40:19] <snowmizer> hey guys!!! I've got a chart container that I've set up with attr("class", 'chart resizable ui-widget-content') and then am creating a variable (newChartDiv) using $(".chart:last-of-type")....that is used to create a variable newNode = newChartDiv.resizable().draggable()[0]. The only handles that appear are the top and bottom. I want to be able to resize from the lower right corner dragging up towards the low
[16:40:20] <snowmizer> er left corner. How do I get these handles?
[16:41:18] <robertmaxrees> snowmizer that was a lot.  got a fiddle or something to show us?
[16:41:21] <taplar> so your resizable is on on the top and bottom?
[16:41:32] <snowmizer> taplar: yep
[16:41:48] <taplar> resizable has an option that you pass in that tells it which corners to be able to drag from
[16:41:59] <taplar> look at the docs for it
[16:42:39] <snowmizer> I tried setting the option "handles" to "all" but it gives me an error that the options can't be set on initialize
[16:43:15] <robertmaxrees> taplar the major resevoir would be lake oroville - there's this picture.  left was pre-drought, right was probably 2013 or so: http://organics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shocking-california-drought-before-after-11.jpg
[16:43:23] <robertmaxrees> then there's this: http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/45/26/63/9792712/4/1024x1024.jpg
[16:43:49] <robertmaxrees> we got just enough rain and snow pack (and show pack is what we really want) to come back a bit.  still not great, but much better.
[16:44:07] <taplar> dang
[16:44:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[16:44:32] <snowmizer> robertmaxrees: here's a sample of my code
[16:44:52] <snowmizer>             var chartContainer = d3.select(myEl)
[16:44:52] <snowmizer>                 .append("div")
[16:44:52] <snowmizer>                 .attr("class", 'chart resizable ui-widget-content');
[16:44:54] <snowmizer>                 .attr("id", "container");
[16:44:55] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[16:44:56] <snowmizer>             var newChartDiv = $(".chart:last-of-type");
[16:44:58] <snowmizer>             var newNode = newChartDiv.resizable( "option", "handles", "all").draggable()[0];
[16:44:58] <taplar> fiddle please
[16:45:00] <robertmaxrees> hey - don't paste into the channel.
[16:45:02] <robertmaxrees> use jsfiddle.
[16:45:18] <snowmizer> don't have it in jsfiddle
[16:45:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'd probably need to make one :)
[16:46:24] <taplar> in the initializing use the object notation
[16:46:36] <taplar> resizable({ handles: 'all' })
[16:46:47] <snowmizer> ahhh....let me try that
[16:47:11] <taplar> what's with the [0] at the end, btw?
[16:47:29] <snowmizer> not sure...:D I copied this from another sample
[16:48:02] <snowmizer> haven't had the thought to remove it
[16:48:17] <taplar> your aware of what it is doing though, right?
[16:48:24] <taplar> you're
[16:49:47] <snowmizer> normally I would say it's referencing an index of an array
[16:50:04] <robertmaxrees> it kind of is - that's grabbing a raw dom node.
[16:50:05] <taplar> [#] off of a jQuery object breaks the element out of the stack
[16:50:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:50:23] <snowmizer> cool...I'm new to jquery, d3, etc...
[16:50:26] <taplar> so going forward if you reference that guy, it will not have access to the jQuery methods
[16:50:35] <taplar> if you don't want that, use eq(#)
[16:50:48] <taplar> or in this case, since you only have one element in the stack, you could drop it
[16:52:39] <snowmizer> yeah I'm not going to have more than one element
[16:53:25] <snowmizer> so it looks like I've got the handles (although they're showing up right next to each other so I'll trim them down)
[16:57:50] <snowmizer> thanks guys
[17:08:44] <goddard> if I have multiple tab blocks setup how can I get the currently selected tab id for items inside the current tab?
[17:08:55] <goddard> like when I click a button inside the tab how can i get the tab id?
[17:09:19] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('.tab').prop('id')
[17:09:54] <robertmaxrees> unless you mean something else.
[17:12:21] <taplar> optionally if they have some sort of active class on them, $('.tab.active')
[17:12:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:12:30] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways to do it.
[17:12:39] <taplar> not sure which is faster
[17:13:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd guess $(this) buuut i have no idea.
[17:13:32] <taplar> yeah i was thinking going up the dom tree might be faster
[17:13:39] <goddard> robertmaxrees: i tried something similar, but didn't work i will try your suggestions though
[17:13:58] <robertmaxrees> goddard you have to be more specific - what tabs are you using?  what does the markup look like?
[17:13:58] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[17:14:10] <goddard> .tabs("option", "active").prop("id");
[17:14:20] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui?
[17:14:23] <goddard> yes
[17:14:42] <goddard> i have a jquery button that is clicked inside the tab
[17:15:07] <goddard> a tab represents an inspection number so I wanted to check which tab we are on when the user clicks a button
[17:15:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah your version should work.
[17:16:02] <goddard> robertmaxrees: getting uncaught typeerror
[17:16:05] <taplar> i think ('option', 'active') only returns the value for that configuration option
[17:16:09] <taplar> not the active tab
[17:16:09] <goddard> currentTab.prop is not a function
[17:16:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that sounds about right.
[17:17:24] <goddard> taplar: ahh so don't need prop?
[17:17:35] <taplar> no, i'm saying your not grabbing the correct thing
[17:17:51] <taplar> i didn't see which method you needed when i quick glanced at the docs.
[17:17:58] <taplar> side tracked for a sec
[17:20:34] <taplar> .ui-tabs-active or .ui-state-active
[17:20:48] <taplar> from inspecting one of the demo, these classes are added to the active tab
[17:21:15] <taplar> if a method cannot get it for you
[17:21:47] <goddard> taplar: thanks ill look at that
[17:23:50] <taplar> though i'm kinda curious why you would need that.  wouldn't you already know what tab your in by which element is being interacted with?
[17:24:48] <goddard> taplar: the tabs are created by the user as well
[17:24:57] <goddard> then the content is generated on creation
[17:25:01] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[17:26:05] <goddard> im always open to suggestions
[17:26:10] <taplar> are you storing data-* keys or something on the tab that your trying to get to?
[17:26:21] <goddard> the tab represents an inspection
[17:26:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about what them being user created has to do with anything.
[17:27:32] <goddard> i dont know anything about the tab or even the form inside them until the user clicks the button
[17:27:43] <goddard> the forms are generated from a database
[17:27:46] <robertmaxrees> are you using an event handler or something?
[17:27:53] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to understand where you're confused :)
[17:28:08] <taplar> ya, i'm trying to understand what information is on the tab that you need
[17:28:25] <goddard> im not really confused i am just trying to get the active tab id to pass to my ajax to put into the database
[17:28:36] <robertmaxrees> are you inside of a click event listener?
[17:29:01] <goddard> yeah the buttons click event
[17:29:19] <taplar> do you have any control over the generated forms?
[17:29:38] <goddard> yeah the type of form and some extra meta data for saving it the proper way
[17:29:52] <goddard> like the type of field
[17:30:01] <taplar> could you put the tab id as a form element or such?
[17:40:04] <goddard> taplar: yeah probably
[18:04:24] <Nemo_> hello good people !
[18:05:05] <Nemo_> does anyone happen to know a little bit about supersized, a code who takes care of site's background ?
[18:06:45] <taplar> nope, looks interesting though
[18:08:25] <Nemo_> i think it is, but right now i found it on a wordpress theme that i have to use and i can't rigure how to make it work properly hehe ^^'
[19:13:30] <iamcurio> how in json can i get .each day of the week
[19:13:31] <iamcurio> http://pastebin.com/rHugFZyH
[19:13:54] <robertmaxrees> in a list or what?
[19:14:37] <robertmaxrees> var daysOfTheWeek = json.times.openTimes.map(function(currentDay) { return currentDay.dayOfWeek });
[19:16:52] <robertmaxrees> iamcurio ^
[19:17:15] <iamcurio> yeah just a list
[19:17:22] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, just use a map.
[19:17:36] <iamcurio> sweet
[19:17:43] <robertmaxrees> gets you an array of all of them.
[19:18:43] <iamcurio> perfect thats what i need
[19:18:48] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[19:29:24] <iamcurio> @robertmaxrees - what about this here this the same process? http://pastebin.com/ECAQn8Ud
[19:29:40] <iamcurio> commented it out in how im trying to display it
[19:29:50] <iamcurio> the rest is working
[19:29:52] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:29:58] <robertmaxrees> so don't use .each() for that.
[19:30:23] <robertmaxrees> and you want .map() still.
[19:30:32] <robertmaxrees> and don't use onclick.
[19:32:30] <iamcurio> okay cheers
[19:32:39] <robertmaxrees> check out event delegation :)
[19:34:49] <iamcurio> cool having a read about it
[21:48:06] <Markthemark> could anyone tell me how i can load a python content inside the targeted div using ajax?
[21:54:56] <elosz> Hello. Here's a trimmed down version : https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=NymPcIVCqA . Basically, if a user clicks on button with id 00, I want to change all buttons starting with 0 like 01, 02 etc
[21:55:07] <elosz> how do I go about it using jQuery?
[22:05:45] <red^> HTML5 Spec: The value must be unique amongst all the IDs in the element's home subtree and must contain at least one character. The value must not contain any space characters.
[22:28:23] <taplar> elosz: change how?
[22:30:59] <elosz> taplar: change the contents. But I figured it out finally. Ty!
[22:33:56] <taplar> Markthemark: that would be a question for a python room about how to return the content on the request
[22:34:18] <Markthemark> k
[23:03:19] <poseidon> if I have 100 divs in a parent container, then I click one of them, is there a way for me to know which nth div I clicked?
[23:03:29] <poseidon> without labeling them id=n
[23:03:47] <taplar> you can select them all and do $(theselector).index(this)
[23:04:30] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/index/
[23:09:12] <elosz> hello, if I want to do this : $('input[name^="group"]').each(function (index) {
[23:09:22] <elosz> but the group part is in a variable, how do I do it?
[23:09:56] <elosz> var grpName = "group1" ; $('input[name^=grpName).each(function (index) { something like that
[23:10:24] <sillyslux> $('input[name^='+grpName).each(function (index) {
[23:10:36] <taplar> either $('input[name^="'+ grpName +'"]')
[23:10:36] <sillyslux> $('input[name^='+grpName+']').each(function (index) {
[23:11:02] <elosz> ty taplar and sillyslux
[23:11:04] <taplar> or $('input').filter(function(){ return this.name.indexOf(grpName) === 0; })
