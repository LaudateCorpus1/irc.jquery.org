[00:20:39] <sammichToo> really happy at having found the most obvious solution ever, for some reason
[00:25:36] <martisj> http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/w2qtQ/
[00:26:22] <martisj> Anybody know how i can make a variable for $(this) in the dialog({...}) part?
[00:26:25] <martisj> from line 5
[00:35:33] <Gazpacho> martisj: the way you already did it
[00:35:52] <martisj> but i can't store it in a variable?
[00:36:00] <martisj> in side the dialog callback function?
[00:36:21] <Gazpacho> you already stored it in a variable that is visible in the callback function
[00:36:39] <Gazpacho> so now use that variable
[00:40:29] <sammichToo> var obj1 = {hi:true}; var obj2 = obj1; var obj3 = obj2; obj2 = undefined; console.log(obj3.hi); // true;
[00:43:14] <martisj> but that is referring to the link, and not the dialog, bur Gazpacho
[00:44:52] <Anticom> hi all
[00:45:07] <Anticom> i want to include the taphold event from jquery mobile to my project without actually using jq mobile
[00:45:23] <Anticom> is there anything similar in "regular" jq?
[00:49:26] <voidPirate> take the taphold code from jquery?
[00:49:41] <Anticom> voidPirate if i got it right it's only in jq-mobile
[00:50:08] <Anticom> but i'm not developing a mobile page... i just want to maintain usability when used with a tablet etc. since there is no right click
[00:50:29] <voidPirate> https://github.com/richadams/jquery-taphold
[00:50:31] <voidPirate> this may help
[00:52:03] <Anticom> hmm works fine in the browser at least
[00:52:07] <Anticom> think i'll give it a shot
[00:52:11] <Anticom> ty
[00:52:22] <interop_madness> i have created a jQuery control for which i want to .trigger() custom lifefcycle events such as beginInit, endInit and so on. since they are lifecycle events, i need to react on them during initialization. i tried $(selector).myControl().on("beginInit", function(){/*...*/});   but of course it's too late
[00:53:03] <interop_madness> because "beginInit" is bound only after initialization has completed. is there any way to bind event handlers for trigger()'ed events earlier?
[00:53:27] <interop_madness> before that, i have used callback functions, but i would like to get rid of them if possible
[00:53:50] <voidPirate> anticom: should work fine in mobile also, it checks for that
[00:54:31] <Anticom> voidPirate well since this is what it's intended to do, it better should :D
[00:54:54] <voidPirate> anticom: :p
[00:55:37] <Anticom> just not sure yet, wether it's worth starring the repo
[00:56:38] <Cork> Internet13: revert the order
[00:56:40] <Cork> oppås
[00:56:50] <Cork> *interop_madness:
[00:56:56] <Anticom> howdy Cork
[00:56:59] <Cork> o/
[00:57:00] <Anticom> :>
[00:57:09] <Anticom> u alright?
[00:57:16] <Cork> interop_madness: $(selector).on("beginInit", function(){/*...*/}).myControl();
[00:57:19] <Cork> Anticom: ya, sure
[00:58:53] <voidPirate> Anticom: you can also generate your own plugin with vanilla JS
[00:58:54] <interop_madness> Cork, cool that worked. is this considered good/acceptable style btw? i am thinking of jQuery controls which may need XHR data for initialization, the request of which may succeed/fail and have .always()-code...
[00:59:14] <Anticom> voidPirate thank's captain obvious. I've wrote a few already ;)
[00:59:24] <Cork> interop_madness: creating events for init, sounds kinda wrong; i would go with callbacks instead
[00:59:42] <Anticom> but software engeneers have the common property of beeing as lazy as possible :D
[00:59:56] <interop_madness> Cork, the problem is, we might need to attach n>1 functions for any given event
[00:59:58] <Cork> interop_madness: $(selector).myControl({ initStart: function() {}, initEnd: function() {} });
[01:00:00] <voidPirate> wouldn't say that :)
[01:00:17] <Cork> interop_madness: so use delegate or $.callbacks
[01:00:24] <Cork> sorry *deferred
[01:00:46] <Cork> interop_madness: or simply accept an array of callbacks
[01:01:16] <interop_madness> ok, but why is that better than using trigger()/on()?
[01:01:37] <Cork> cause events bubbles, and is kinda costly
[01:01:47] <interop_madness> apart from the somewhat strange style of first-registering-callbacks-then-creating-control
[01:01:54] <interop_madness> hm ok
[01:01:57] <Cork> and they only make sense if the event can happen after creating the widget
[01:02:34] <Cork> having them for when the widget is created and then never again, is kinda broken (as they won't trigger if you bind them)
[01:03:47] <interop_madness> ok, will consider. thanks for all the info
[01:03:59] <Cork> interop_madness: and with $.Callbacks or deferred you can create almost the same syntax
[01:04:21] <interop_madness> yeah im looking into $.Callbacks right now
[01:04:25] <Cork> $().myControl().initEnd.add(function() {}).add(function() {}).add(function() {}) for example
[01:08:11] <interop_madness> Cork, but how would i attach a callback function on beginInit? from what i understand i have to create a new $.Callbacks object, which i can only do during creation of the jQuery control, i.e. too late
[01:09:09] <Cork> hmm true
[01:10:02] <Cork> interop_madness: so the array of callbacks to the function then
[01:10:11] <interop_madness> ok
[01:10:54] <interop_madness> is the performance impact of trigger() substantially smaller if stopPropagation is called inside all handlers?
[01:11:20] <Cork> the performance cost isn't that big
[01:11:53] <Cork> and no stopPropagation wouldn'
[01:12:00] <Cork> *wouldn't make much difference
[01:12:19] <interop_madness> because in terms of syntax i would prefer trigger()/on() instead of $(selector).onWhatever.push(function(){ /*...*/});
[01:12:28] <Cork> interop_madness: but what you generate isn't by definition an event
[01:12:33] <Cork> and thats why it doens'
[01:12:37] <Cork> stypid '...
[01:13:01] <Cork> *and that's why it doens't really belongs as events
[01:13:12] <sCoRpi> what kind of crazy feature is this in chrome
[01:13:13] <sCoRpi> you just type in an id, without anything else
[01:13:13] <sCoRpi> and it gives you back the correct element
[01:13:13] <sCoRpi> O_o
[01:13:16] <sCoRpi> automatic "undefined variable to getElementById" selector
[01:13:37] <Cork> interop_madness: well but as the event listener needs to be bound before the function is called for them to work kinda shows that it isn't what they are meant for
[01:14:41] <interop_madness> ok, but apart from that, in terms of performance, all other things being equal, i might as well use events?
[01:14:45] <Cork> sCoRpi: as far as i know, that is common practice
[01:14:52] <interop_madness> not that i insist on it, just weighing the options...
[01:15:05] <Cork> interop_madness: except that it doesn't make sense as an event yes it "works"
[01:15:12] <interop_madness> ok
[01:15:15] <sCoRpi> Cork: it is? didn't know  that, but seems like rather bad practice to match undefined things to dom elements
[01:15:55] <Cork> sCoRpi: name="" from elements becomes global functions in js; you think that is better?
[01:17:37] <Cork> sCoRpi: opps, sorry, it was id not name; remembered wrong
[01:17:50] <Cork> sCoRpi: so the id part is just how js works
[01:17:53] <sCoRpi> Cork say what?
[01:18:10] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/wgXJG/
[01:19:38] <sCoRpi> Cork: wasn't aware of that, but yeah, you seem to be right :)
[01:20:01] <Cork> even scarier is that attributes becomes accessible the same way
[01:22:10] <Cork> sCoRpi: but much of this is only for inlining, so it isn't as big a problem if you run with unobstructive js
[01:22:35] <Cork> (in other words, keep your js out of the html)
[01:23:09] <sCoRpi> Cork: that's obvious
[01:23:17] <sCoRpi> i just stumpled upon this, while i i renamed a var which previously was named lke the id
[01:23:20] <sCoRpi> and the code didn't break
[01:24:19] <sCoRpi> this is in general somethign i'd stay away from
[01:25:06] <Cork> sCoRpi: heres another fun one http://jsfiddle.net/wgXJG/1/
[01:25:20] <Cork> (might work in your browser depending on how up to date it is)
[01:26:01] <Cork> you should get something like "TypeError: download is not a function @ http://fiddle.jshell.net/wgXJG/1/show/" if the browser is fairly modern
[01:28:46] <Anticom> huston we got a problem

[02:51:18] <jeremy--> has anybody ever used jquery tablesorter plugin on a table that is being created dynamically
[02:51:37] <jeremy--> I'm finding its not working and I've ensured that it has the required thead/tbody which is the usual suspect for issues
[02:54:13] <rabbi1> can .map () return the attr instead of just this.id ?
[02:55:11] <JPeterson> is there a problem with fadeTo duration in chrome in 1.9.1/jquery.min.js?
[02:55:24] <JPeterson> it has the expected result in firefox
[02:55:42] <JPeterson> f.e. duration 5000
[02:55:48] <rabbi1> var links = $('a').map(function() { return this.href }).get()  . what is the functionality of get() here ?
[02:56:15] <JPeterson> in chrome the opacity is unchanged until 5000 and then change rapidly
[03:04:31] <Cork> rabbi1: don't use $().map if you want anything other then elements out
[03:04:53] <Cork> var links = $.map($('a'), function() { return this.href });
[03:05:29] <Cork> rabbi1: the function of .get() in the other solution is try try to unwrap the responses from the jquery it gets wrapped with
[03:05:35] <rabbi1> Cork: ok, if i need entire elements then will use your prior suggestion right ?
[03:05:40] <Cork> and is really a workaround from using the wrong function
[03:05:45] <Cork> yes
[03:05:50] <rabbi1> ok, sure thanks
[03:06:10] <rabbi1> As of now i just need the attribute and nothing else
[03:07:06] <Cork> oh btw no that was wrong
[03:07:06] <rabbi1> cool, any link which explains the difference ?
[03:07:19] <Cork> rabbi1: var links = $.map($('a'), function(elm) { return elm.href });
[03:07:30] <Cork> $.map doesn't set this in the callback function
[03:07:37] <Cork> ?jquery.map
[03:07:37] <bot-t> jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[03:07:39] <Cork> ?map
[03:07:40] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[03:08:18] <rabbi1> what does 'elm' refer to ?
[03:08:34] <Cork> like i said $.map doesn't set this, so you can't do this.something
[03:08:42] <JPeterson> answer: a css transition is itnerfering with fadeTo
[03:08:44] <Cork> you need to take the value that is the first argument
[03:08:45] <rabbi1> any element inside the 'a'?
[03:08:50] <Cork> no
[03:09:05] <rabbi1> ok, got it
[03:09:47] <Cork> $('a').map(function() { return $(this).attr('href') }); => $.map($('a'), function(elm) { return $(elm).attr('href'); });
[03:13:35] <tangorri> hi
[03:13:36] <rabbi1> $.map($('#div .links'), function('a') { return $('a').attr('href'); });
[03:14:17] <tangorri> I try to do something like $(this).parent("class selector") but I really don't get it
[03:14:31] <rabbi1> Cork: what does 'elm' here ?
[03:14:46] <Cork> uh...
[03:14:55] <Cork> rabbi1: no you totally missed the point
[03:15:05] <rabbi1> $.map($('#div .links'), function('a') { return $('a').attr('href'); }); this returns nothing
[03:15:12] <Cork> rabbi1: $.map loops over the array from $('selector')
[03:15:26] <Cork> and elm in function is the current element in the loop
[03:15:46] <Cork> rabbi1: also function('a') {} isn't valid javascript
[03:16:07] <Cork> ?.closest @ tangorri
[03:16:08] <bot-t> tangorri, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[03:16:15] <Cork> ?.parent @ tangorri
[03:16:16] <bot-t> tangorri, .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[03:16:34] <Cork> tangorri: parent only checks if the direct parent matches, and return nothing if it doens't
[03:16:41] <Cork> you most likely want .closest
[03:16:54] <rabbi1> I am trying to get the href value of all the elements inside a div
[03:17:32] <rabbi1> elements with a particular class name
[03:17:35] <tangorri> well I tried https://gist.github.com/tangorri/5933569
[03:17:58] <Cork> rabbi1: something like $.map($('#div a'), function(elm) { return elm.href; }); then
[03:18:02] <tangorri> ok Cork
[03:19:06] <Cork> tangorri: and just the code doesn't help when you have selector questions, the dom structure is very important
[03:20:20] <rabbi1> what is elm here ?
[03:21:21] <Leo___> hay guys is there any other was i can shorten this code

[03:22:43] <kilianv> Hi all. I'm writing tests and bumping into asynchronicity problems. Is there an easy way to force jquery's animation to 'animate' instantaneous without changing the actually .animate() call that i'm testing?

[03:23:06] <kilianv> *the actual
[03:23:08] <Cork> tangorri: so when a .nice-list-toogler is clicked you want the find the parent with .nice-list-selection ?
[03:23:18] <tangorri> iep exactly
[03:23:33] <Cork> tangorri: $(this).closest('.nice-list-selection')
[03:23:37] <tangorri> ok
[03:23:40] <sfdcNoob> Leo___: avaoid spaces alerts and comments lol :D
[03:23:57] <Cork> rabbi1: yes, it loops over each link in the result
[03:24:06] <Cork> rabbi1: and that is what you said you wanted
[03:24:28] <Leo___> can you help me sfdcNoob
[03:24:31] <rabbi1> yeap
[03:25:00] <Leo___> im using the alerts for testing
[03:25:44] <rabbi1> Cork: but href is returning me the complete path including http://www.example.com/#linkid â¦. i just wanted the 'linkid'
[03:27:03] <Cork> rabbi1: yes, cause you're using the prop not the attr
[03:27:23] <Cork> $(elm).attr('href') or elm.getAttribute('href')
[03:28:23] <rabbi1> Cork: return $(el).attr('href'); used this
[03:28:37] <rabbi1> yeah, perfectâ¦ thanks

[04:04:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> any idea why?
[04:04:50] <superdoo> why is it possible that if I want to hide a loading spinner div with code, I cant, only from the chromedevtools console?
[04:04:52] <grafi> maybe you can't css?

[04:32:20] <tankblergh> its basically "read values from a css file"
[04:37:57] <superdoo> xec_, strangely is hidden doesnt work as the counterpart of is visible in a special case
[04:38:26] * xec_ is confused
[04:38:27] <superdoo> so now I use is visible with and empty { } and then put all code to the else statement

[04:47:47] <notmoose> would it be possible to check through jquery if inside an iframe, html is being added?
[04:48:04] <notmoose> to set some sort of event on an iframe, and see when content is being added to it?
[04:49:10] <relix> I'm using fadeIn() on a div that's set to display:none
[04:49:24] <relix> it jumps to completely visible, then slowly fades out (!) after jumping to completely visible agian
[04:50:02] <relix> it actually fades out to halfway, then fades in again
[04:50:04] <relix> it's so strange
[04:50:06] <relix> no idea what to do
[04:52:34] <ravenzz> ?demo @ relix
[04:52:34] <b-ot> relix: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[04:52:59] <relix> ravenzz yeah I'm guessing as soon as I break it down to the simpler components it will work as expected
[04:53:16] <ravenzz> do that then :)
[04:53:26] <relix> ravenzz then the layout won't be the same
[04:53:30] <ravenzz> ?newContent @ notmoose
[04:53:30] <bot-t> notmoose, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[04:53:34] <relix> I'm guessing it's got something to do with the display: table

[04:56:46] <ravenzz> eheh
[04:56:51] <anli> Isnt there a onmouseleaveoutside even or something?

[04:58:23] <relix> http://jsfiddle.net/kBBZS/3/
[04:58:34] <relix> because jquery probalby thinks it's already shown due to there not being a dislay:none
[04:58:42] <notmoose> ravenzz: im trying this: http://jsfiddle.net/ with the newContent plugin, am I doing it wrong?
[04:58:48] <relix> which wasn't in the docs as far as I can tell
[04:58:55] <relix> should use .animate manually, I suppose?
[05:00:07] <ravenzz> relix yeah
[05:00:19] <ravenzz> fadeIn doesn't alterate the opacity
[05:02:14] <ravenzz> notmoose did you accidentally give me the wrong link?
[05:03:33] <notmoose> yes

[05:04:06] <notmoose> its the twitter embedded timelines widget, and i want to know when the content is loaded inside the iframe
[05:04:41] <ravenzz> relix you could use fadeTo instead

[05:07:13] <ravenzz> notmoose what browsers do you want to support?
[05:07:49] <noregret_> can I use the data object to get the current time in such format "ddmmyyyyHHMM"
[05:07:53] <noregret_> date *
[05:08:12] <systemfault> Yeahâ¦ but you'll have to do the fomatting yourself...
[05:08:23] <systemfault> If you want a lib that sucks less that Date, try moment.js
[05:08:36] <notmoose> ravenzz: firefox chrome ie i guess
[05:09:32] <notmoose> all i want to know is when the widget is done loading, but it doesnt have a callback function so now i need to figure it out to see when the dom is manipulated
[05:09:35] <notmoose> but i cant get it to work
[05:09:40] <relix> thanks ravenzz
[05:13:29] <superdoo> any tool to slow down a browser (eg. see loading spinner working) ?

[05:36:18] <audiotek> hey guys, simple question.. how can I select the next input on an onkeypressevent (enterkey)
[05:36:38] <Cork> depends on the dom structure
[05:36:47] <audiotek> $('this:next').focus()
[05:36:49] <audiotek> aint working
[05:37:01] <audiotek> can't I chain next with this
[05:37:02] <audiotek> ?
[05:37:07] <Cork> if they are siblings you can do $(this).nextAll(':input').focus()
[05:37:39] <audiotek> how about $(this:nextAll:input)
[05:37:44] <audiotek> ill try that
[05:37:52] <Cork> if they arn't siblings you could do something like var inputs = $(':input'); inputs..eq(inputs.index(this) + 1).focus
[05:37:59] <Cork> *var inputs = $(':input'); inputs..eq(inputs.index(this) + 1).focus()
[05:46:18] <audiotek> onkeypress=" if (event.keyCode == 13) {$(this).nextAll(':input:visible').focus()}"
[05:46:23] <audiotek> nope..
[05:46:25] <audiotek> how about starting from a div and selecting the second input
[05:46:27] <audiotek> ('#form:input:visible:nth-child(2)') ?
[05:46:54] <Cork> audiotek: ther are no element called this you can't search for it
[05:46:57] <Cork> audiotek: this is a variable pointing to a dom element, so you need to base the search from that element
[05:51:39] <grafi> oÃ´
[05:53:16] <thump_> ?after
[05:53:16] <thump_> ?.after()
[05:53:16] <thump_> ?.After()
[05:53:16] <thump_> is bot down?
[05:53:17] <HarryPitfall> audiotek, I suggest that you add a "class" to all "focusable" itens (since textarea and select can be also focused), and do something like $(document.activeElement).next('.js-focusable').focus()
[05:53:17] <Cork> audiotek: and how you would do that depends on the dom structure
[05:53:17] <Cork> HarryPitfall: :input focus both inputs, selects, and textareas
[05:53:17] <Cork> uh *:input selects
[05:53:17] <HarryPitfall> didn't know that
[05:53:17] <Cork> ?:input
[05:53:17] <HarryPitfall> I need to find a doc about theses meta-selectors
[05:53:17] * Cork pokes bot-t 
[05:53:17] <Cork> `api :input
[05:53:17] <b-ot> Cork: :input Selector: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[05:53:17] <Cork> HarryPitfall: it's all in the api dos
[05:53:17] <Cork> *docs
[05:53:18] <Cork> damn... lot of splits today...
[05:53:18] <Cork> audiotek: we need the dom structure to tell you how you can select the next input
[05:53:18] <Cork> audiotek: though var inputs = $(':input'); inputs.eq(inputs.index(this) + 1).focus() should work regardless of structure
[05:53:19] <Cork> thump_: bot-t is down ya
[05:53:19] <Cork> `api after
[05:53:19] <b-ot> Cork: .after(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[05:53:50] <Cork> ugg
[05:53:54] <sammich> boot
[05:53:54] <thump_> Cork: what is the correct function for inserting an element as first-child given selectot?
[05:54:14] <Cork> thump_: insertAfter or after
[05:54:26] <sammich> .prepend?
[05:54:34] <Cork> depending in what direction you want (also use api.jquery.com)
[05:54:43] <Cork> sammich: that would be IN the element not after
[05:58:46] <Bloomberg> morning guys!!
[06:30:02] <shoky> why synchronously
[06:41:08] <DannyZB> when binding a custom context menu in jquery , on a right click , the item below doesn't get a right-click event
[06:41:11] <DannyZB> how do I fix that ?
[06:59:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hello, I have a modal form dialog where users can upload files...Doing an ajax call to process the form values in a php script... The text values are sent, but how can I pass the file itself via an ajax call?
[07:08:50] <PixelGrinch> @ecky--ptang-zoob : this might help: http://tutorialzine.com/2013/05/mini-ajax-file-upload-form/
[07:10:23] <Doggie52> Is there any way I can listen for changes in two separate elements at the same time?
[07:10:28] <Doggie52> i.e. using change()
[07:14:56] <BillCriswell> Doggie52: You can do $('.classOnBothElement').on('change', function(){ ... });
[07:14:58] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ujoqad/1/edit
[07:15:15] <Doggie52> BillCriswell, true, but what if there is no common class or other denominator?
[07:15:17] <Bloomberg> Why doesn't  do what I need
[07:15:26] <BillCriswell> $('.el1, .el2').on('change', function(){ ... });
[07:15:42] <Doggie52> aah the comma sign
[07:15:44] <Doggie52> jesus me
[07:15:45] <Bloomberg>  I need show me the id of tab
[07:15:59] <Doggie52> Michael your tabs aren't in the HTML
[07:16:12] <Bloomberg> why?
[07:16:17] <Bloomberg> ok
[07:16:21] <Doggie52> Well I can't see them at least
[07:16:36] <Doggie52> Maybe my browser is selectively hiding output from you
[07:17:09] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ujoqad/3/edit
[07:17:13] <Bloomberg> This is all
[07:17:42] <Doggie52> I'll go through it when I have time, which unfortunately isn't now :(
[07:17:44] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You can add jquery and jqueryui with two clicks.
[07:17:44] <berryciderspider> guys how do i select multiple classes, e.g. $('.first-class .second-class')
[07:17:54] <BillCriswell> berryciderspider: ,
[07:17:56] <NickTomlin_> put a comma between your selectors
[07:17:56] <Doggie52> lol berryciderspider
[07:18:06] <Doggie52> we're in the same boat!
[07:18:27] <berryciderspider> Doggie52: great minds think alike!
[07:18:44] <Doggie52> ;)
[07:18:53] <BillCriswell> berryciderspider: Unless you want an element like <div class="first-class second-class"> then you want .first-class.second-class
[07:19:53] <BillCriswell> but if you want <div class="first-class"> and <div class="second-class"> the , is the right thing to do .first-class, .second-class
[07:20:11] <berryciderspider> BillCriswell: thanks for that
[07:23:47] <ph88> i can't modify css before adding it to the dom ??  http://pastebin.com/KxgL5cVU
[07:25:01] <systemfault> That should work.
[07:25:06] <shoky> ph88 are you sure those .find()s are finding anything?
[07:25:24] <berryciderspider> guys what's wrong with this? http://dpaste.com/1290219/
[07:25:25] <ph88> shoky: no i don't think they are finding ...
[07:25:40] <shoky> then there's nothing to set css on, yay?
[07:25:54] <ph88> i checked   template.find()   in console but it returns  jQuery(   )
[07:26:07] <ph88> why is find not working ?
[07:26:13] <shoky> .find only looks for descendants
[07:26:18] <shoky> maybe you want .filter
[07:26:39] <ph88> shoky: ah that's a good idea thx
[07:26:48] <berryciderspider> thanks shoky
[07:27:02] <shoky> berryciderspider i was talking to ph88 ;p
[07:27:33] <Doggie52> hmm when using $(' class1, class2 ').change() it only catches changes to the first class
[07:27:39] <Doggie52> Not both
[07:27:56] <shoky> those ain't classes
[07:28:11] <Doggie52> .class1, .class2 i mean
[07:28:27] <shoky> $('.class1, .class2') will do it for elements matching either of the classes
[07:28:43] <Doggie52> Yeah but it doesn't in my case. It only catches the element matching .class1
[07:28:54] <shoky> ?demo
[07:28:55] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[07:32:48] <Doggie52> Well this is odd, I get http://jsbin.com/abanax/1/edit to work
[07:34:15] <Doggie52> Oh I'm such an idiot
[07:34:20] <Doggie52> I mistook an input for a select
[07:35:09] <horacsio> I'm looking for a collaborator keen in jquery
[07:35:22] <horacsio> anyone?
[07:36:13] <shoky> you should probably give some more detail than that..
[07:37:28] <driador> morning everyone... quick question.  I have a form with two pages, the parent and the child.  I have an event bound to an element on the child that should select a radio button on the parent and trigger an event bound to it.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck having to code around IE 7's shortcomings.  I've tried using click() and trigger("click") on my element selector.  Both throw the error 'Jscript object expected'.
[07:38:33] <driador> Anyone have any suggestion on how to code around IE 7's issue here?
[07:39:35] <horacsio> I can give more details
[07:39:58] <horacsio> let me see where I can post the job first
[07:41:20] <webguy024> hello, pressing enter in a form fires a buttons click event - is there a way to fix it? Just press enter in the form anywhere (chrome browser) -> http://tinker.io/0a6dd/8
[07:43:15] <systemfault> It triggers submit, not a click
[07:44:05] <webguy024> systemfault: that is what I would expect, but it hits the button element first
[07:44:41] <systemfault> In forms, you should always handle the submit event, not the click.
[07:46:02] <webguy024> i use a button element for error flash messages (close button), since it is first pressing enter will terminate on that button. I guess I could return true to let it propagate, but that seems like a shortcut.
[07:46:38] <shoky> you can take the button out of the form
[07:47:29] <webguy024> i did think that first, but I'm just a cog in the machine and that is not my position :D
[07:48:01] <webguy024> however that might be the easiest thing to do
[07:49:41] <SinnerNyx> The first time I run ".animate" on any of the elements on my page there is about a half second pause before the animation begins. Any ideas why that could be?
[07:50:03] <shoky> SinnerNyx
[07:50:09] <webguy024> well its not the easiest thing to do, the damn css is scoped through the form. Surprised that it doesn't trigger the 'submit' input button instead of the first button it finds in the form.
[07:50:10] <shoky> SinnerNyx: not without seeing it
[07:50:32] <SinnerNyx> shoky fair enough. I'll try to figure out a minimum case and post it here when I do. bbs
[07:51:02] <ph88> does jQuery stop for 1 second at a fadeTo(1000, 1);  event or can i use a callback here ?
[07:51:28] <SinnerNyx> is jsfiddle down?
[07:51:37] <grafi> yup
[07:51:38] <shoky> webguy024: put type="button" on the button
[07:51:54] <webguy024> thanks shoky I'll try that now
[07:52:24] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/uhoqin/1/edit
[07:52:26] <Bloomberg> I have this
[07:52:31] <SinnerNyx> its apparently been down for 8 hours.. I've neverr had that issue with them.. Is there anything similar?
[07:52:32] <Bloomberg> but now I'm getting a problem
[07:52:45] <webguy024> shoky that worked great - thanks for the pointer
[07:53:01] <grafi> jsbin.com, tinker.io, codepen.io @ SinnerNyx
[07:53:03] <Bloomberg> I show the new tab and show me the last data and actual data and so on
[07:53:18] <SinnerNyx> grafi: thanks :)
[07:53:29] <grafi> no worries
[07:57:52] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[07:58:14] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/okiron/1/edit
[07:58:19] <Bloomberg> I have a problem with this!
[07:58:19] <shoky> Bloomberg: you're adding a click handler to the spans each time an <a> is clicked
[07:58:27] <shoky> that's most likely not your intention
[07:58:28] <Bloomberg> That is doing
[07:58:32] <Bloomberg> I don't need that
[07:58:45] <shoky> huh?
[07:58:58] <Bloomberg> I need each time I click the span show me the id of wrapper tab
[07:59:11] <horacsio> ok here's the proposal: http://pastebin.com/6wq5tNRe
[07:59:25] <shoky> don't put the span .on('click'  inside the <a>'s .on('click'
[07:59:29] <horacsio> with some links to understand better the idea
[08:00:23] <Bloomberg> shoky: But If I put it outside the event show me undefined
[08:00:53] <shoky> Bloomberg: first of all, if you wan't help with it, put some html there and make a working demo that shows the issue
[08:01:30] <Bloomberg> Ok
[08:01:49] <shoky> also, i'm sure you can figure out why it's showing undefined, and maybe even think of how to solve it
[08:01:59] <shoky> but don't nest the click handlers inside each other, for sure
[08:02:43] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/iridod/1/edit
[08:02:47] <Bloomberg> That is complete
[08:03:01] <horacsio> shoky: did you saw the proposal?
[08:03:46] <shoky> horacsio: i saw what you're looking for, more or less. i wouldn't call it a proposal ;P
[08:04:02] <horacsio> whatever. can you do it?
[08:04:55] <shoky> don't know exactly what you need done there, but.. probably
[08:05:22] <Bloomberg> I need for eaxmple when click in the plus logo show me the id of actual tab actived
[08:05:44] <grafi> shoky can do everything <:
[08:06:14] <shoky> Bloomberg: why so many separate <script>s  :\
[08:06:29] <Bloomberg> each one is a ajax call to a controller
[08:06:34] <Bloomberg> each one call info
[08:07:06] <shoky> that's no reason for them to be separate
[08:07:13] <Bloomberg> Ok
[08:07:30] <Bloomberg> But what you suggest me for get the id in each one click
[08:08:43] <horacsio> shoky: please take a look to the links
[08:10:17] * BillCris_ takes a nap.
[08:11:30] <shoky> horacsio: i did
[08:11:39] <Bloomberg> shoky: Understand what I need to do
[08:11:41] <Bloomberg> ?
[08:13:21] <horacsio> shoky: IT's a toggle which need to transform a div into a dotted line through a minus and plus icons, with a click.
[08:15:32] <SinnerNyx> alright I figured out my issue. Thanks guys :)
[08:15:48] <grafi> good job SinnerNyx
[08:16:00] <SinnerNyx> :P
[08:17:34] <grafi> so horacsio what do you actually need done?
[08:25:30] <RonWhoCares> I am trying to setup a jQuery AJAX which triggers on the click of a radio button.  The purpose is to rate a website on a scale of 1 to 10.  Does anyone see what I have done wrong?  http://jsfiddle.net/8WwXb/
[08:28:48] <RonWhoCares> I justy found your weather
[08:28:57] <RonWhoCares> oops, wrong window about the weather
[08:33:48] <Bloomberg> shoky: Are you there?
[08:44:12] <shoky> Bloomberg: now ya
[08:44:40] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/agajew/1/edit
[08:44:43] <Bloomberg> Now I have this
[08:45:17] <Bloomberg> But doens't show me the id
[08:50:29] <shoky> Bloomberg: http://jsbin.com/iridod/2/edit
[08:50:45] <shoky> your tabs html is wrong
[09:00:25] <Bloomberg> shoky: Show undefined!
[09:00:43] <shoky> Bloomberg: my jsbin? does not
[09:00:50] <Bloomberg> yes
[09:01:19] <shoky> when i click on the plus, i see the ID of the active tab in the console..
[09:01:28] <Bloomberg> really?
[09:01:32] <Bloomberg> I cannot see nothing
[09:01:46] <shoky> i thought you saw undefined...
[09:02:19] <Bloomberg> you changed something to html?
[09:02:29] <shoky> yes
[09:02:40] <shoky> removed the div you had around the tab divs
[09:02:47] <shoky> because that was wrong
[09:04:56] <Bloomberg> <shoky>: Ok, is working well, but before of show the id show undefined
[09:05:00] <Bloomberg> So alert two times
[09:05:09] <Bloomberg> first with "undefined" and second with id
[09:05:11] <Bloomberg> Why?
[09:05:14] <shoky> i dont know what you're doing man
[09:06:37] <farid> Hi I have a very easy question....:) .... I am generating text boxes from a recordset and they are named as  txt13, text2, txt54 - where the number is the id of the record. .. how can i read the value of txt13 when in my jquery code i am getting the id which is 13
[09:07:09] <farid> I am trying to make it as 'txt' +13
[09:07:52] <shoky> trying how
[09:08:04] <shoky> your question isn't clear
[09:08:40] <farid> i get id as var id = $(this).parent().parent().attr('id');		
[09:09:01] <shoky> 'txt' + id
[09:09:01] <shoky> ?
[09:10:04] <farid> and i want to get teh value of the text box that is named as txt13 and id txt13.
[09:10:53] <shoky> and what's the problem
[09:11:51] <farid> waht is the syntax
[09:12:18] <shoky> $( id_here ).val() ?
[09:12:44] <farid> I thought so too.. but it aint wokring .. let me give it a shot again
[09:12:47] <shoky> er well, $('#' + id_here).val()
[09:13:13] <shoky> if it ain't working make a small demo
[09:14:57] <farid> I dont know how and why.. it just started working wno :)
[09:15:15] <farid> now*
[09:15:36] <farid> I think all i needed to do was to talk to you :)
[09:15:40] <farid> Thanks
[09:15:50] <shoky> ;]
[09:26:51] <wolfehr> any reason why I can't (when 'element' does exist inside o$object) $object.find('element',function(){} when $object = $('foo').parents('bar:first');
[09:27:21] <shoky> find doesn't have a callback argument
[09:27:38] <wolfehr> and that would be exactly my problem :P
[09:27:49] <wolfehr> cheers
[09:28:56] <`RobW> hey all
[09:29:04] <`RobW> i have a json string in K:V format
[09:29:19] <shoky> not in json format?
[09:29:23] <`RobW> it is
[09:29:32] <shoky> ok then
[09:29:42] <`RobW> it's coming from some table output.. but what I have a problem with is iterating over each element
[09:29:50] <SporkSpork> How can I put the word "Subscribe" on this tab, before it slides out? http://jsfiddle.net/FHK2J/8/
[09:30:11] <`RobW> tried $(json).each(function(k, v) { console.log(k, v); }); -- but k = 0, and v = object
[09:30:14] <`RobW> this doesn't make sense.
[09:30:30] <shoky> `RobW: json is a string?
[09:30:55] <`RobW> no json is an object
[09:31:04] <`RobW> (it's already parsed)
[09:31:06] <shoky> make a demo
[09:31:11] <shoky> (it's not json after it's parsed)
[09:31:25] <`RobW> I know.. but in my example that's how I reference the json object
[09:31:31] <NoiseEee> sounds like you have an array of objects?
[09:34:12] <`RobW> http://jsfiddle.net/pxB2q/
[09:34:47] <shoky> you want $.each(json, function..
[09:34:53] <shoky> not $(json).each
[09:36:06] <`RobW> ah crap
[09:36:07] <`RobW> duh
[09:36:10] <`RobW> thanks

[10:05:42] <msouth> I have a menu like the one shown here: http://jqueryui.com/menu/ .  I want it to be a popup/drop-down (not sure what term people use, I mostly work backend) menu for populating a form element.
[10:06:03] <msouth> I need the multiple level/hierarchical stuff
[10:06:03] <klusias> hello. how is possible to get cursor position in dialog()? i can get pageX, etc, but these positions are not relative to dialog
[10:06:35] <msouth> but it takes up the whole form if it's expanded.
[10:36:56] <DarkGhost`> hello, I know there is .parent(), but is there like a .next() to get <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> from the first td to the third one?

[10:37:26] <DarkGhost`> lol thnaks
[10:53:33] <tryingtovacation> Hi everybody, i have a jquery modal that fails silently in IE7 / 8 only. no IE console output or debugging errors. Thoughts as to how i can start to narrow down what might be going wrong?
[11:00:27] <BillCriswell> tryingtovacation: Hard to know without looking.
[11:00:54] <BillCriswell> Is it relying on weird CSS to show up? No errors would suggest CSS oddness to me.
[11:02:17] <tryingtovacation> BillCriswell: hey, thanks for the reply. the element doesn't even seem to exist in browsers it works for post-click, which is odd to me. i usually stray away from jquery modals but i inherited this codebase...
[11:02:42] <tryingtovacation> BillCriswell: as in the element does not appear in source post-click
[11:03:17] <BillCriswell> Are you doing "View Source" or viewing it through the Developers Tools?
[11:03:39] <tryingtovacation> BillCriswell: doesn't exist in source, does exist in developer tools (chrome)
[11:04:26] <BillCriswell> tryingtovacation: So I guess the plugin fails when it tries to add the element to the DOM. Not sure why it would fail in IE7 or 8 in that case.
[11:05:41] <tryingtovacation> BillCriswell: my thoughts exactly, very strange -- works in IE 9+, FF Chrome
[11:06:02] <momomomomo> tryingtovacation: What does?
[11:07:09] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: [13:53] <tryingtovacation> Hi everybody, i have a jquery modal that fails silently in IE7 / 8 only. no IE console output or debugging errors. Thoughts as to how i can start to narrow down what might be going wrong?
[11:07:49] <momomomomo> tryingtovacation: Do you have a doctype declared on the page?
[11:08:59] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: content="IE=edge,chrome=1"
[11:09:16] <momomomomo> tryingtovacation: Do you have a doctype?
[11:09:20] <momomomomo> ie: <!doctype html>
[11:09:33] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: <!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM "about:legacy-compat">
[11:10:58] <momomomomo> Don't know tryingtovacation, IE is very finicky about semicolons, html structure, etc. Could be anything. I'd double check your code and markup
[11:11:30] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: T_T it's a HUGE spring mvc web app (spaghetti code) that i inherited
[11:11:51] <momomomomo> Best of luck my friend
[11:12:01] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: know any common quirks that would cause silent failure?
[11:12:38] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: what's weird is that it works on some other modals on the site
[11:12:44] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: just this one is failing
[11:13:50] <momomomomo> tryingtovacation: If you're running on intranet and this is .net, typically old IE browsers force compatability mode and like ie7 for some reason
[11:14:56] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: we hard declare ie edge in the meta tags
[11:15:01] <momomomomo> you might try adding a http://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/httpprotocol/customheaders to ie 8
[11:15:20] <momomomomo> tryingtovacation: meta tags don't matter for IE if you want it to listen to you
[11:15:46] <momomomomo> tryingtovacation: You need to forcefully send through an HTTP header; and also, ie=edge won't work in all cases for ie8, so you may have to force ie8 for all IE
[11:18:40] <momomomomo> see tryingtovacation  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/deviations/archive/2009/05/07/how-to-enable-ie-8-compatibility-view-for-your-whole-web-site-or-for-specific-web-site-directories.aspx
[11:31:24] <zizzl> Hey guys when I have different sized content hidden in jQuery accordions, is there a way to get the page view to make sure the heading of that accordion is at the top of the window?
[11:38:07] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: thanks for the suggestions
[11:38:15] <momomomomo> tryingtovacation: Did that work for you?
[11:38:59] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: no :( there are also other UX bugs so im just going to disable features until ppl are back into office on monday
[11:39:34] <momomomomo> You could try disabling scripts one at a time and see if your modal works after disabling one of them
[11:55:29] <tryingtovacation> momomomomo: that's probably what i'll have to do, but not this wknd
[11:55:49] <tryingtovacation> there are probably a few hundred permutations to attempt (not on my vacation) :)
[12:04:55] <czytacz> hi, is there a way to make jQuery triggers work with elements that have been appended after the site has loaded? I have a div that changes its class after a click, but the defined actions for this class don't work with this element. I presume it's because the DOM has been generated earlier and the script doesn't monitor the page for any changes...
[12:07:15] <czytacz> I have a class .active that i'm adding to a div by clicking on it. Unfortunately, I can't make $(".active") work with this element, because it has changed it's class after the DOM has been loaded
[12:19:32] <Guest30926> so..
[12:20:14] <Guest30926> Is there a clever way to keep track of the whole event bubbling propagation chain?
[12:20:30] <NoiseEee> keep track of? other than knowing how it works?
[12:20:38] <Guest30926> lets say I have a click handler on some element nested deep inside a table
[12:21:02] <Guest30926> I have my listener set on the table, and I want to know the path, so I know from within which tr the event came from
[12:21:18] <Guest30926> rather than the target element itself
[12:21:45] <NoiseEee> Guest30926: you'd have to ask about the .closest('tr') of the element
[12:22:16] <BillCriswell> Guest30926: http://jsbin.com/aconec/1/edit like this?
[12:22:32] <BillCriswell> Oh, closest('tr') would be the right stuff.
[12:22:38] <Guest30926> NoiseEee, sadly it won't work for me because its a very messy nested dom structure -- so imagine tables nested inside trs of tables a few levels
[12:23:33] <Guest30926> BillCriswell, not quite
[12:23:41] <NoiseEee> Guest30926: well, you can always know the element that fired the handler, from there its really up to you and how you've designed your page (nested tables being, well, you know)
[12:24:06] <Guest30926> NoiseEee, I didn't design the page, the dom structure is not up to me :)
[12:24:16] <Guest30926> (I'm making a browser extension)
[12:25:02] <Guest30926> I can obviously just start walking up the tree from the event.target with ParentElement.ParentElement.. but I'm wondering if there's a more elegant way
[12:25:38] <weeb1e> Hi everyone, I am trying to find out how to stop child elements inside a draggable element from being seperately draggable. I have found multiple "solutions" to this issue and not one of them has had any effect.
[12:29:30] <dopie> hey guys
[12:29:40] <dopie> i want to do this feature but without the tabbing

[12:51:06] <czytacz> ops :)
[13:11:09] <dopie> hey guys
[13:11:13] <dopie> why isnt this working
[13:11:24] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/5936884
[13:12:54] <dopie> its working
[13:12:57] <dopie> freaking awesome
[13:12:57] <dopie> :)
[13:18:53] <Bloomberg> ho can I to do some like ::  $(src:eq(2)).css('display', '');
[13:19:00] <Bloomberg> If src is a var
[13:19:03] <Bloomberg> how*
[13:19:24] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: $('.class').eq(foo)
[13:21:08] <Bloomberg> $(src):eq(2).css('display', '');?
[13:21:30] <BillCriswell> No.
[13:21:36] <BillCriswell> $(src).eq(2).css('display', '')
[13:24:01] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: Man, why  I set on load document this :: src.css('display', 'none');
[13:24:26] <Bloomberg> Show good, but I need the space is empt
[13:24:28] <Bloomberg> empty*
[13:24:51] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: visibility: hidden; is probably what you want.
[13:25:02] <Bloomberg> empty*
[13:25:04] <BillCriswell> BAsically like setting the opacity to 0
[13:25:10] <Bloomberg> maybe, I'm going to test it!
[13:26:59] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: Man not
[13:27:07] <Bloomberg> I need don't save the space
[13:27:21] <Bloomberg> Show me all list white
[13:27:24] <Bloomberg> Like invisible
[13:27:42] <Bloomberg> I need to hidde the space
[13:27:45] <BillCriswell> display: none; pretty much removes the element, visiblity: hidden; hides the element but keeps the space it takes up.
[13:32:47] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ukipot/1/edit
[13:32:51] <Bloomberg> See that plz
[13:33:39] <Co-Leader> o/
[13:34:29] <BillCriswell> What are you tyring to do?
[13:34:42] <Bloomberg> Is a menu of tabs
[13:35:08] <Bloomberg> So dinamycally get the id and if is = to something show me only specific inputs
[13:35:18] <jtal> does jquery click() happen when enter is pressed? it seems to (I dont want it to)
[13:35:30] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: http://jsbin.com/ukipot/2/edit like this?
[13:36:02] <Bloomberg> What do you changed?
[13:36:17] <BillCriswell> display block if you want show it.
[13:36:34] <BillCriswell> Also, $(src) is redundant, src is already a jquery object.
[13:36:51] <BillCriswell> s/is/was
[13:37:22] <Bloomberg> But why doesn't hidde the spcaes
[13:37:25] <Bloomberg> spaces*
[13:37:35] <BillCriswell> because of the <br>s
[13:38:19] <BillCriswell> Get rid of the <br>s and just do input {display:block; } and you'll see the diifference.
[13:38:44] <Co-Leader> oh hay
[13:38:52] <Co-Leader> i thot u gaize were on vacation
[13:38:58] <Co-Leader> dafuq

[13:39:08] <BillCriswell> about to be.
[13:39:29] <jtal> ah, difference between submit and button input types
[13:39:32] <Co-Leader> lol dotn use br
[13:39:42] <Co-Leader> isnt br about to deprecate
[13:39:58] <BillCriswell> Co-Leader: I doubt it. Still has very valid uses.
[13:40:31] <Co-Leader> ok nm
[13:40:44] <Bloomberg> Is well this  ::::  src.css('float', 'left', 'display', 'none');?
[13:41:14] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: No, would need to do src.css({float: 'left', display: 'none'});
[13:41:40] <Co-Leader> argh
[13:41:43] <Co-Leader> keep css in .css
[13:41:51] <Bloomberg> Thanks man, I'm sorry for asking many times.. thank you again
[13:41:53] <Co-Leader> watevs not my code
[13:41:57] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[13:42:02] <BillCriswell> Have a good weekend guys!
[13:42:15] <Bloomberg> Same for yo!
[13:42:17] <Bloomberg> you*

[13:44:00] <Co-Leader> this.model.save
[13:44:30] <Co-Leader> oh does jquery have slideto side
[13:44:42] <Bloomberg> If I need to break a line and I need to put the property block on display but also I need to put display none, how can i get it?
[13:44:45] <Co-Leader> besides slideout
[13:47:13] <Bloomberg> some like, src.css({display:'none', display:'block'});
[13:47:20] <Bloomberg> But just takes he block display
[13:47:26] <Bloomberg> the*
[13:47:30] <Co-Leader> i cant tell what u need
[13:47:35] <SporkSpork> I have a div slider that is sliding beneath instead of on top of the website's main div. How do I force the slider to stay on top?
[13:47:50] <eddiemonge> SporkSpork: z-index
[13:48:04] <Co-Leader> umm id try to avoid zindex
[13:48:16] <Co-Leader> unless u cant nest
[13:48:27] <Co-Leader> in a desired maner
[13:48:29] <eddiemonge> Bloomberg: do you mean you want visibility: hidden?
[13:48:50] <Bloomberg> no
[13:48:53] <SporkSpork> eddiemonge: oh, okay. thanks
[13:49:46] <eddiemonge> Bloomberg: well you cant have display: block and display: none at the same. they are opposite values
[13:50:13] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ukipot/3/edit
[13:50:23] <Bloomberg> Is that
[13:50:44] <Bloomberg> I can't to use <br /> break lines becauseshow me the white spaces
[13:51:18] <Bloomberg> So, I need to show them a vertical list (like <br />) but also I need to use display none
[13:51:23] <Bloomberg> how you will do it?
[13:52:45] <Bloomberg> Solve it
[13:54:11] <zizzl> Hey guys when I have different sized content hidden in jQuery accordions, is there a way to get the page view to make sure the heading of that accordion is at the top of the window?
[13:55:31] <Bloomberg> How can I to do some like  :::  ({$(src).eq(2), $(src).eq(3)}).css('display', 'block');
[13:55:45] <Bloomberg> I need to set that property more than one object
[13:58:44] <jwmann> Can I use the data() method to check for value?
[13:59:17] <Bloomberg> how you will do it?
[13:59:27] <jwmann> Yea
[13:59:49] <jwmann> I want to select an element with a specific data-type value
[14:00:14] <Bloomberg> yes of course
[14:00:19] <Bloomberg> if(){}
[14:00:43] <Bloomberg> if($(this).data('some') == "something"){ do this }
[14:01:22] <Bloomberg> like this?
[14:02:45] <jwmann> I figured I could do it like that but I'm imagining something like this: $('#parentelement').child().data('mydatatype', 'this value').dosomething();
[14:03:38] <utroda> I'm using mousemove to scroll a list vertical on hover. On mobile I'm trying to use touchmove, but its delayed, and its trying to scroll the whole document, any advice on how to get this to work?
[14:04:06] <eddiemonge> Bloomberg: what are you trying to do?
[14:04:25] <Co-Leader> lol
[14:04:26] <Bloomberg> to set a same property for several selectors
[14:04:30] <Co-Leader> tel him Bloomberg
[14:04:36] <Bloomberg> Like this  ::  ({$(src).eq(4), $(src).eq(2)}).css('display', 'block');
[14:04:39] <eddiemonge> jwmann: is the element something like <a data-type="something" ?
[14:04:53] <jwmann> Yes
[14:04:55] <Bloomberg> Exactly is like this
[14:04:56] <eddiemonge> ?add @ Bloomberg
[14:04:57] <bot-t> Bloomberg, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[14:05:08] <Bloomberg> You can set that property with any thing
[14:05:09] <eddiemonge> jwmann: $('[data-type="something"]')
[14:05:21] <jwmann> Perfect!
[14:05:25] <eddiemonge> Bloomberg: but i think thats not what you want
[14:05:37] <jwmann> Thanks eddiemonge!
[14:05:51] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ukipot/3/edit
[14:06:03] <Bloomberg> I need to do it different to that
[14:06:34] <Bloomberg> will be only an array and setting the property to array
[14:07:05] <Bloomberg> Understand me?
[14:08:08] <eddiemonge> not really. explain what you want to without that example
[14:08:37] <Bloomberg> I need to simplify
[14:09:01] <Bloomberg> Like this works with one input  ::   $(src).eq(4).css('display', 'block');
[14:09:20] <eddiemonge> forget code. explain the problem you want to solve
[14:09:29] <Bloomberg> But If i need to set the ('display', block') property at five elements
[14:09:59] <Bloomberg> I will repeat many script doing this way
[14:10:06] <Bloomberg> Is for simplify
[14:10:30] <eddiemonge> Bloomberg: without any jquery or javascript, explain what you want to do
[14:10:42] <Co-Leader> lol
[14:11:02] <Bloomberg> oh my god!!!
[14:11:04] <Co-Leader> he many confuz
[14:11:07] <Bloomberg> I need to do that
[14:11:08] <Co-Leader> :(
[14:11:11] <Bloomberg> I'm explain you
[14:11:19] <Co-Leader> ya but
[14:11:25] <Co-Leader> not understand
[14:11:38] <Bloomberg> In my page I have a horizontal menu with tabs of widget jquery
[14:11:44] <Co-Leader> try moer clear
[14:12:07] <Co-Leader> Bloomberg: try on a non holiday weekend
[14:12:18] <Bloomberg> According the tab selected I need to show different information
[14:12:46] <eddiemonge> ok, thats what tabs are for: to show different information based on the selected tab
[14:12:59] <Bloomberg> yes
[14:13:05] <Bloomberg> bingo!!
[14:13:14] <slick-> I have a client that sucks at speaking english, and keeps reporting jquery errors i can't replicate
[14:13:18] <slick-> what do I do
[14:13:20] <eddiemonge> so whats the problem? you described the use case for jquery tabs
[14:13:27] <slick-> no matter what the fuck i can't replicate the problem
[14:13:41] <Co-Leader> ok dun wory
[14:13:41] <eddiemonge> slick-: charge them for your time spent
[14:13:55] <eddiemonge> slick-: share their screen so they can replicate it in front of you
[14:14:08] <slick-> im so confused
[14:14:12] <Bloomberg> The problem is in the same page I have a list of many input text
[14:14:14] <slick-> I'm dealing with fucking morons
[14:14:28] <slick-> but the money is good so i don't wanna say no
[14:14:33] <eddiemonge> slick-: welcome to irc
[14:14:40] <Bloomberg> According the selected tab I need to show only for example the eq(4) and eq(8)
[14:14:50] <slick-> olol thx
[14:14:59] <eddiemonge> Bloomberg: so outside of the tab area, you want to show information but based on the current tab?
[14:15:08] <Bloomberg> But If I do that list I'm going to repeat many times  this line   ::  $(src).eq(4).css('display', 'block');
[14:16:38] <eddiemonge> Bloomberg: why dont you give the groups a class and then on the activate event for tabs, show that group class?
[14:17:29] <Bloomberg> For each one to do one group?
[14:18:31] <eddiemonge> ?
[14:18:51] <Bloomberg> var one = {$(src).eq(2), $(src).eq(4), $(src).eq(6)}; 	if(index == "tabs-1"){ 		one.css('display', 'block'); 		}
[14:19:25] <eddiemonge> no. stop using .eq()
[14:19:31] <eddiemonge> forget that exists
[14:19:54] <Bloomberg> So?
[14:26:13] <jwmann> Did they change the way the click() method world in 1.10?
[14:26:56] <NoiseEee> click() is a method that is long outdated
[14:26:59] <NoiseEee> what are you trying to do?
[14:27:29] <jwmann> A basic 'on click', 'do this'
[14:27:37] <NoiseEee> use .on()
[14:27:50] <jwmann> kk
[14:27:54] <NoiseEee> something.on('click',function(e) { doSomething();});
[14:28:19] <Bloomberg> do like this :: $('#your_id').on('click', function(){})
[14:28:27] <megalomix> hi
[14:28:50] <jwmann> NoiseEee: Perfect, thank you!
[14:28:59] <megalomix> guys i have: <td> <a> </td><td> <a> </td><td class="cur"></td><td> <a> </td>
[14:29:12] <megalomix> how can i get the a tag AFTER td.cur ?
[14:32:26] <Foxhoundz> .children();
[14:32:30] <dopie> hey all
[14:32:41] <dopie> how do i call markdown on this
[14:32:54] <dopie> to get the text and apply markdown syntax to it
[14:33:21] <Foxhoundz> or parent > child if you want to target just the first child element

[14:33:47] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5937399
[14:34:05] <Foxhoundz> dopie: or what
[14:34:07] <Foxhoundz> that*
[14:34:08] <megalomix> NoiseEee, yes i was seeing this example: $('li.third-item').next().css('background-color', 'red');
[14:34:11] <NoiseEee> megalomix: var aTag = $('td.curr').next().find('a');
[14:34:15] <megalomix> exactly
[14:34:15] <megalomix> ok
[14:34:18] <megalomix> perfect i try
[14:34:27] <dopie> Foxhoundz,  what?
[14:34:43] <eddiemonge> Bloomberg: http://jsbin.com/ukipot/5/
[14:35:49] <jwmann> Hmm my initial problem was that the data() method wasn't finding my data-foobar data typeâ¦ hmm
[14:35:57] <utroda> anyone every have the issue of links inside of a touchmove area not being clickable?
[14:37:41] <eddiemonge> dopie: what?
[14:38:06] <Bloomberg> eddiemonge: Works well, but honestly I don't understand what did you do!
[14:38:21] <dopie> eddiemonge,   I have design_description then an i have preview
[14:38:31] <dopie> how do i call markdown on preview
[14:38:31] <eddiemonge> what i said to do. group your inputs with classes, then hide or show depending on which tab gets clicked
[14:38:45] <eddiemonge> Bloomberg: study the code until you understand what is going on
[14:38:59] <eddiemonge> dopie: do you have a markdown plugin?
[14:39:04] <dopie> yes
[14:39:15] <dopie> Im using redcloth with rails
[14:39:29] <eddiemonge> dopie: i mean a javascript markdown plugin
[14:39:41] <dopie> no not yet
[14:39:45] <eddiemonge> im assuming you are trying to do this on the front end and not post to the backend right?
[14:39:57] <dopie> correct
[14:40:42] <eddiemonge> dopie: then how do you expect to convert to markdown if you dont have a compatible markdown plugin?
[14:40:53] <dopie> https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js   would that be it?
[14:40:54] <Bloomberg> eddiemonge: newTab is a function of tabs widget?

[14:46:27] <boytoy> But I can't for the life of me get it to recognize the clicks: http://jsbin.com/avujix/8/edit -- anybody know?
[14:52:32] <eddiemonge> boytoy: you wanna do what?
[14:52:40] <jwmann> Am I using this data() method incorrectly? Why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/RyuMU/
[14:53:30] <Bloomberg> eddiemonge: how works when you put  inside class separated values  :::   class='my_class another_value and_another_value'
[14:54:05] <eddiemonge> jwmann: what does $('a') match?
[14:54:25] <eddiemonge> a single element or multiple elements?
[14:54:29] <jwmann> Every anchor (this is just for testing)
[14:54:44] <jwmann> Multiple
[14:57:50] <eddiemonge> jwmann: read http://api.jquery.com/data/#data2 , specifically the description and that should tell you why your example doesnt work
[14:59:53] <jwmann> So basically it only works if it finds 1 elements
[15:01:07] <eddiemonge> jwmann: no, it only returns the result from the first item. see ? each
[15:01:08] <bot-t> jwmann, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:01:35] <Bloomberg> Bye guys!!
[15:01:40] <Bloomberg> Nice weekend!
[15:02:13] <jwmann> eddiemonge: Oh so it returning the value from the first anchor in the list which happens to not have a data-type
[15:02:15] <jwmann> I see.
[15:11:09] <Eiam> Is there a way to have .toggle do one thing for a show, and another for a hide?
[15:12:09] <Eiam> like .toggle({in:{'slide',{direction:'right'}},out:{'slide',{direction:'left'}})
[15:12:22] <Eiam> or rather in/out would say "show/hide"
[15:16:09] <eddiemonge> Eiam: you could not use toggle and create the toggle function yourself
[15:16:36] <Eiam> well, sure, then I've got to write code to check the state and if its already in progress animating etc
[15:16:42] <Eiam> basically, do what I want jquery to do for me =)
[15:17:23] <majuscule> Is there any simple way to have a 'done' function run only *once* when run on a selector? What I mean is, I'd like `myfunc()` to run only once in this example: $('.myclass').fadeOut('fast', myfunc())
[15:17:37] <eddiemonge> Eiam: duck punch it then. overwrite toggle to do what you want
[15:17:39] <Eiam> eddiemonge: so that sounds like "no there is no way to have toggle do one thing for a show, and another thing for a hide"
[15:17:53] <eddiemonge> majuscule: um it will
[15:18:02] * Eiam tries to decide how badly he wants this effect
[15:18:21] <majuscule> eddiemonge: err, i guess you're right. a better example is $('#foo, #bar'), sorry
[15:18:24] <majuscule> :-)
[15:19:35] <eddiemonge> majuscule: set a flag and check for that in the function
[15:22:32] <Eiam> eddiemonge: just ended up doing https://gist.github.com/anonymous/af7170328599b0910393
[15:22:40] <msouth> I have a menu like this: http://jqueryui.com/menu/  .  I want it to be a dropdown, populating a form field.
[15:23:01] <msouth> I'm a bit of a newbie
[15:23:41] <eddiemonge> Eiam: you really should cache $(element)
[15:23:55] <eddiemonge> msouth: then you want autocomplete, not menu
[15:24:23] <Eiam> eddiemonge: hmm? oh, i guess it already is as var element = $(blahblah)
[15:24:30] <Eiam> so the $(element) is redudant
[15:49:27] <jwmann> How can I ignore click events while an element is already animating (so clicking animation doesn't perform multiple times)
[15:52:52] <cusco> jwmann: when you start the animation to use the .on() again
[15:52:55] <cusco> i guess
[15:53:47] <jwmann> Can you elaborate? I'm a little confused.
[15:54:35] <cusco> I can't think on how to remove the onclick, but I can think of: $("p").on("click", function(){ return false; });
[15:54:50] <cusco> when you start the animation
[15:54:58] <cusco> and add the onclick again, when you stop the animation
[15:54:59] <cusco> ...
[15:56:20] <offlim> how would i do this. 200 + 10% = 220?... Im trying to add up a number plus the percent
[15:56:41] <offlim> and im having a problem with the percent part
[15:56:55] <jtal> 200 * 1.1 ?
[15:57:48] <Eiam> okay, I'm trying to figure out how to do a bounce or animate with an easeOutBounce where each bounce is 'less'
[15:58:07] <Eiam> the effect("bounce") unfortunately is the same size bounce distance each bounce
[15:59:44] <Eiam> nvm its got built in easing
[15:59:48] <Eiam> it was so subtle I barely noticed it
[16:00:01] <offlim> jtal what if the percent number is 50?
[16:01:34] <cusco> 1.5
[16:01:56] <cusco> *1.6 to add 60%, * 0.8, to take 80%
[16:02:03] <cusco> basic math
[16:02:04] <offlim> im trying to do this in jquery.. i was told you do,  total = number + (percent/100)
[16:02:36] <offlim> I know basic math just trying to do it in jquery
[16:02:41] <cusco> why jquery?
[16:02:46] <cusco> how does jquery relate to math?
[16:02:48] <jtal> its the same in jquery or any other kind of language
[16:02:58] <shoky> like algebra
[16:02:59] <jtal> its number * percent/100
[16:03:13] <jtal> sorry
[16:03:39] <jtal> thats the difference
[16:04:41] <offlim> Ok Thanks jtal
[16:04:49] <jtal> number * (1+(pct/100)) got it?
[16:05:40] <Goopyo> how do you live a hover in 1.10?
[16:06:00] <Goopyo> i.e detect hovering on items added after the dom is loaded
[16:06:43] <shoky> Goopyo: event delegation with .on()  and mouseenter/mouseleave events
[16:07:04] <swimrr> hey all
[16:07:14] <Goopyo> shoky: so I have this http://pastebin.com/rzmET92E
[16:07:20] <shoky> and if you don't know what event delegation is, read this link see ?on
[16:07:21] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:07:30] <swimrr> I'm using gallerific, and my <a name> link is only loading the <name> element at the bottom of the page, not the top
[16:07:35] <shoky> Goopyo: that's not using event delegation
[16:07:38] <swimrr> any ideas what setting could be causing this?
[16:07:38] <Goopyo> anything wrong there? $('li.result_item') works in the debugger
[16:08:06] <shoky> Goopyo: read the link i gave you, especially the part about event delegation
[16:08:15] <Goopyo> shoky: thanks reading now
[16:08:47] <offlim> jtal: got it thanks
[16:11:25] <Goopyo> shoky: so am I understanding this correctly? A) Id do something like $('li').on('mouseover', '.result_item ,  â¦ ");
[16:11:34] <Goopyo> B) You need one item in there for it to work?
[16:11:40] <Goopyo> B*)
[16:12:01] <Goopyo>  By picking an element that is guaranteed to be present at the time the delegated event handler is attached, you can use delegated events to avoid the need to frequently attach and remove event handlers.
[16:12:09] <Goopyo> i.e the first element must guranteed to be there
[16:12:12] <shoky> Goopyo: isn't the <li> the same element with result_item class?
[16:12:34] <Goopyo> yeah thats bad I should do $('ul').on("mousover" , "li.result_item", ...)
[16:12:43] <shoky> you got it
[16:12:46] <Goopyo> thanks mate
[16:17:18] <swimrr> I think my issue must be some sort of js load command, b/c if I hit F5 it loads with the <name> element at the top
[16:48:32] <superscott[8]> can anybody tell me if i'm doing this wrong? it works, but i'm sure they're probably a better way to do this.   https://gist.github.com/superscott/5937836
[16:48:55] <superscott[8]> there is*
[16:55:26] <adavia> is this correct $("#errorproperties").show().html(resp); ?
[17:02:51] <shoky> superscott[8]: http://jsbin.com/oyahuc/1/edit
[17:04:15] <shoky> adavia: yes
[17:07:03] <superscott[8]> shoky: thanks :D i think i took the long way around that
[17:17:03] <adavia> shoky:  do you have any idea why i need to click twice to get the messageerror class displaying here http://jsfiddle.net/RE27m/
[17:21:19] <Foxwell> Is anyone here? I'm having a problem with my site and I could use some help.
[17:23:36] <Foxwell> o.O theres 753 people in here. All of you are idling?
[17:35:58] <shoky> adavia: i dunno.. my first guess would be something is up with the ajax response the 1st time. but i'd need to see more of the code or a demo of the problem
[17:36:18] <shoky> ?anyone @ Foxwell
[17:36:18] <bot-t> Foxwell, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[17:36:18] <b-ot> Foxwell: Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
[17:36:38] <shoky> er i meant ?ask
[17:36:42] <adavia> shoky:  ill set that up
[17:41:01] <adavia> shoky:  http://jsfiddle.net/RE27m/2/
[17:41:08] <adavia> shoky:  thats all im doing
[17:43:46] <Foxwell> I've run into a little snag on the site I'm building. It seems to happen in internet explorer. I'm using spriteley to animate an image squence that was compiled into a single image. When I use the scroll bar the animation lags and it's more apparent the faster I scroll. Has anyone had a problem like this before or have any ideas on what could cause it?
[17:45:08] <Foxwell> only in internet explorer*
[17:45:56] <snover> old ie is slow
[17:46:02] <snover> does that help?
[17:46:56] <Foxwell> yes and no. see I first noticed this when testing in IE8
[17:47:18] <Foxwell> in IE8 the animation either completely stopped or was so laggy it seemed that way
[17:47:22] <Foxwell> at least with the sprite animations
[17:47:51] <Foxwell> in IE9 it's more of an apparent lag, but I know there must be more to it than the limitations of the browser
[17:48:14] <Foxwell> after all there are lots of sites with good functioning sprite animations many at far higher resolutions than the one I've used
[17:53:07] <shoky> adavia: does it send the request the first time you click? check your devtools network tab, and add an error handler to the $.ajax call
[17:53:23] <adavia> shoky:  yes
[17:53:27] <adavia> it does
[17:53:53] <adavia> shoky:  the request is being sent.. it just not display the message  the first time
[17:54:24] <shoky> adavia: ok do what i said
[17:54:39] <shoky> adavia: and add a console.log to your success handler to see if it's being called or not
[17:54:48] <adavia> ok
[18:00:45] <adavia> shoky:  im getting the correct response from the server but not the class
[18:12:19] <adavia> shoky:  the problem seems to be when i  do addClass('messageerrors')  if i remove that part it works fine the first time
[18:16:03] <adavia> shoky:  fixed it.. the problem is that show(); should be at the end $("#errorproperties").addClass('messageerrors').html(resp).show();
[18:16:16] <adavia> didnt realize about that
[18:38:35] <gehrc> Hey everyone -- jQuery noob here. I'm trying to get a dynamic select box to work on my site but it's giving me trouble. The sample I'm following worked though. Pastebins following:
[18:38:41] <gehrc> http://pastebin.com/ZCUfM4Hc -- Main HTML
[18:39:28] <gehrc> PHP to grab results: http://pastebin.com/iJ5e2qjR
[18:40:02] <gehrc> Aaaand the JS to tie them together
[18:40:02] <gehrc> http://pastebin.com/LYNn8Xcu
[18:40:27] <gehrc> Also, the instructions I was using: http://www.ssdtutorials.com/tutorials/series/dependable-dropdown.html
[18:41:07] <metaxy> When I create an element by append()ing some HTML, is the element guaranteed to be there by the next line?
[18:41:31] <gehrc> I've ruled out the PHP as the problem, as I can call that PHP file directly and it'll show me the same output on both sites
[19:26:09] <shoky> metaxy: pretty much
[19:33:39] <Ramaniscence> >_>
[19:33:50] <Ramaniscence> sorry mt
[20:43:08] <dzarzagza> can u store multiple classes in a variable? like this $newlist = $('.classone', '.classtwo');
[20:45:41] <dzarzagza> nvm, got the thing to work with $newlist = $('.classone, .classtwo');
[20:46:55] <eph3meral> dzarzagza: yeah it's just regular CSS selectors, anything you can do with CSS selectors you can do with jQuery
[20:47:10] <eph3meral> dzarzagza: and better, because jQuery doesn't need to rely on CSS3 support in the browser
[21:25:55] <joelteon> how do I determine which handle the user is using during a resize function?
[21:26:13] <joelteon> event*

[21:59:51] <nights> god im really starting to HATE git
[22:01:18] <tw2113> you just don't git git
[22:04:27] <greg5green> i see what you did there
[22:06:56] <tw2113> greg5green, if we take a cue from gif pronounciation, he doesn't git jit
[22:07:35] <greg5green> hah
[22:07:57] <greg5green> my new years resolution was to pronounce gif like he wanted it pronounced
[22:08:02] <greg5green> it lasted like two days
[22:28:01] <dopie> hey all...
[22:28:03] <dopie> i have this
[22:28:04] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/5938769
[22:28:22] <dopie> i would like when I click on the inputbox for the placeholder text to dissapear
[22:28:30] <dopie> but fadeout
[22:28:34] <dopie> how would i accomplish this
[22:29:31] <abjorn> ?fadeOut
[22:29:42] <abjorn> aw no bot-t
[22:29:45] <abjorn> http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[22:29:59] <dopie> abjorn,  where would i add that tho??
[22:30:41] <tw2113> ack!
[22:31:21] <abjorn> oh do you mean you want the placeholder text to fade out?
[22:31:29] <abjorn> fuck
[22:31:32] <dopie> yes
[22:31:32] <abjorn> wasnt paying attention
[22:31:36] <abjorn> uh
[22:31:37] <abjorn> lol
[22:31:38] <abjorn> WELL
[22:32:01] <dopie> pretty much i got the placeholder working on all platforms
[22:32:03] <dopie> with that code
[22:32:18] <dopie> now i want to make it fadeout when the box is in focus
[22:32:27] <abjorn> you'd have to manipulate css to fade the color of the placeholder text to white (or whatever the bg color of the input is)
[22:32:44] <dopie> ok
[22:32:44] <tw2113> ^
[22:32:44] <abjorn> which is annoying because there are different ways for styling placeholder text in different browsers
[22:33:16] <dopie> but with the jquery i used i pretty much made it goto jquery
[22:33:16] <dopie> ?!
[22:33:30] <abjorn> what
[22:33:35] <dopie> nothing
[22:33:38] <dopie> its my designer brain speaking
[22:33:45] <tw2113> potato
[22:33:55] <dopie> tw2113,  pretty much
[22:33:56] <greg5green> you only trigger that if the browser doesnt have placeholder support? right?
[22:34:04] <greg5green> right??!?
[22:34:08] <abjorn> ?!?!?!
[22:34:12] <dopie> #?@!#?@!#?@!?#@!?#@
[22:34:18] <dopie> greg5green, i would think so yes
[22:34:22] <abjorn> Well
[22:34:23] <dopie> i havent yet tested it out
[22:34:37] <abjorn> if you trigger that placeholder shim or whatever you want to call it everywhere, it would make the fadeout easier
[22:34:46] <greg5green> I mean, placeholder text is confusing as shit to normal people
[22:35:00] <abjorn> then you just have to fade out the normal text color of the input to white (then back to it's normal styled color after you're done)
[22:35:02] <greg5green> and to possibly override their browser's default actions would be even more confusing
[22:35:08] <dopie> hhaha
[22:35:22] <tw2113> so wait
[22:35:35] <dopie> tw2113,  is that a reference to tradewars?
[22:35:35] <tw2113> the desire is to have the placeholder text fade out instead of automatically disappear?
[22:35:42] <dopie> yes
[22:35:50] <abjorn> tbh, i think if an input isn't obvious without placeholder text i think youre doing something wrong in your design but thats just me
[22:36:05] <abjorn> tw2113: yeah thats what hes wanting
[22:36:05] <dopie> its pretty obvious
[22:36:15] <dopie> just something the client to go... ooh cool
[22:36:16] <dopie> :)
[22:36:27] <nights> btw
[22:36:31] <nights> how do you guys pronounce PNG?
[22:36:35] <nights> (the image format)
[22:36:40] <abjorn> P-N-G
[22:36:41] <tw2113> i would hope they were impressed enough to see the text in the input in the first place
[22:36:47] <tw2113> the way abjorn said
[22:36:54] <tw2113> no on tradewars
[22:37:00] <nights> people in japan pronounce it PING
[22:37:02] <greg5green> ping
[22:37:02] <nights> and i hate it
[22:37:02] <dopie> oh ok
[22:37:10] <nights> why?
[22:37:16] <greg5green> because its easy to say
[22:37:18] <abjorn> well that's not the weirdest thing the japanese people do so
[22:37:19] <greg5green> i also url as earl
[22:37:22] <greg5green> and json as jason
[22:37:31] <abjorn> fuck that
[22:37:35] <nights> well if its easy to say
[22:37:36] <abjorn> you'll just confuse me
[22:37:43] <tw2113> json is a sexy manbeast
[22:37:45] <abjorn> I'll be like "who is jason and what does he have to do with this"
[22:37:48] <nights> but you wouldnt believe its the official way to pronounce it would you
[22:37:58] <greg5green> i would
[22:38:03] <tw2113> how is json supposed to be pronounced?
[22:38:08] <tw2113> lets ask Crockford
[22:38:08] <nights> j-son?
[22:38:11] <abjorn> "j-son" is the typical
[22:38:19] <nights> jason
[22:38:19] <tw2113> j-son...jason...what's the difference
[22:38:20] <abjorn> it's the only way ive ever heard it pronounced, anyways
[22:38:26] <greg5green> i actually think its jason, but i hear J SAN at work all the time
[22:38:31] <greg5green> usually
[22:38:32] <greg5green> as
[22:38:34] <greg5green> J SAN OBJECT
[22:38:37] <abjorn> I don't pronounce jason "j-son"...
[22:38:41] <greg5green> and then my head explodes
[22:38:47] <nights> god what did i start
[22:38:49] <abjorn> I pronounce jason "jay-son"
[22:38:54] <abjorn> ya'll are weird
[22:38:59] <tw2113> no you're weird abjorn
[22:39:01] <greg5green> j-son and jay-son is the same
[22:39:02] <greg5green> :P
[22:39:04] <abjorn> not as weird as coldhead though
[22:39:09] <nights> PING is not correct anyway
[22:39:10] <tw2113> he's australian
[22:39:11] <nights> eat that
[22:39:14] <abjorn> i know, right
[22:39:16] <abjorn> what a weirdo
[22:39:22] <greg5green> damn convicts
[22:39:51] <greg5green> sorry, thats a sort point isn't it?
[22:39:54] <abjorn> i wonder what time it is in australia right now
[22:40:00] <abjorn> i bet hes asleep or something
[22:40:11] <abjorn> or hibernating or whatever they do in australia
[22:40:19] <tw2113> http://www.worldtimezone.com/
[22:40:30] <tw2113> looks like early afternoon
[22:40:31] <dopie> explosion
[22:40:33] <greg5green> he might be snowed in
[22:40:33] <nights> its like 14.40
[22:40:43] <greg5green> i saw on the news there is some snow storm in southern australia or something?
[22:40:44] <abjorn> I assume they've learned to sleep with one eye open since everything living in australia is specially designed by satan himself to kill
[22:42:20] <nights> hm
[22:42:21] <nights> So what is PNG, and why is it worthy of its own home site? PNG (pronounced "ping") is the Portable Network Graphics format, a format for storing bitmapped (raster) images on computers. Unofficially its acronym stands for "PNG's Not GIF.
[22:42:24] <nights> i guess i was wrong
[22:42:31] <nights> never going to admitt that though
[22:42:41] <greg5green> :P
[22:43:17] <Foxhoundz> why is jquery so awesome?
[22:43:33] <nights> my pride is set back badly :(
[22:43:33] <greg5green> the hard work of the jquery team
[22:44:03] <tw2113> it's all about the $() fox
[22:44:05] <nights> Foxhoundz: its too awesome to describe in one line
[22:44:05] <tw2113> Foxhoundz,
[22:44:06] <abjorn> these people and their recursive acronyms
[22:44:20] <coldhead> Foxhoundz: because john resig is awesome
[22:44:21] <greg5green> JSON (/ËdÊeÉªsÉn/ jay-sawn, /ËdÊeÉªsÉn/ jay-sun), or JavaScript Object Notation, is a text-based open standard designed for human-readable data interchange.
[22:44:22] <abjorn> and here I thought stallman was the only one insane enough to like recursive acronyms
[22:44:23] <greg5green> jay sun
[22:44:26] <greg5green> excellent
[22:44:31] <abjorn> oh hey coldhead youre not dead
[22:44:33] <coldhead> and because you're awesome, Foxhoundz
[22:44:42] <tw2113> oh hi coldhead
[22:44:46] <Foxhoundz> coldhead: does he still maintain it? Or has turned into the next Linus
[22:44:46] <greg5green> LAME Is Not An MP3 Encoder
[22:44:47] <tw2113> we were just discussing you
[22:44:56] <abjorn> coldhead you should totes come to jqconf austin
[22:45:06] <coldhead> Foxhoundz: i don't think he uses gombuters anymore
[22:45:12] <abjorn> with the head in austin right now you should feel right at home
[22:45:15] <coldhead> abjorn: yeah was thinking of it
[22:45:23] <coldhead> might propose a talk
[22:45:27] <abjorn> niace
[22:45:46] <abjorn> work is buying me a tikkit
[22:45:56] <coldhead> thanks werk!
[22:45:59] <abjorn> cause that shit is $$$
[22:46:04] <coldhead> isit?
[22:46:06] <coldhead> fuck
[22:46:12] <coldhead> have to get a proposal in then
[22:46:18] <abjorn> well, to me
[22:46:22] <abjorn> i dont know how these things usually run for
[22:46:35] <coldhead> "i could buy two whole tacos with that money!!"
[22:46:47] <abjorn> $374
[22:46:54] <coldhead> i will pay up to $29 for a good conf
[22:47:00] <coldhead> if that includes alcohol
[22:47:01] <greg5green> lo
[22:47:09] <greg5green> so you will pretty much go to no conferences
[22:47:10] <coldhead> otherwise they can fuck off
[22:47:12] <greg5green> fair enough
[22:47:19] <abjorn> he could probably go to some perl conferences
[22:47:21] <abjorn> that's about it
[22:47:25] <greg5green> hah
[22:47:28] <coldhead> $haha
[22:47:35] <abjorn> %lol
[22:47:38] <greg5green> but theyd be too obfuscated to figure out where they are located
[22:48:25] <abjorn> it really is pretty pricey but luckily i dont have to worry about that
[22:48:38] <abjorn> it aint nothing but a thang to a company so
[22:48:48] <abjorn> MEANWHILE AT MY LAST JOB
[22:48:57] <coldhead> if that's 2 days it's not too expensive
[22:49:13] <coldhead> if you work it out per hour
[22:49:20] <coldhead> you could easily drink the ticket price
[22:49:23] <coldhead> if it includes drinks
[22:49:33] <coldhead> it will include drinks, it's texas
[22:49:39] <coldhead> drinks are mandatory
[22:50:28] <abjorn> well considering i usually drink scotch i guess i could drink that in two days, yeah
[22:51:58] <tw2113> abjorn, earlier i tweeted my theory that whiskey can be/is medicine
[22:52:24] <coldhead> it can certainly be used to sterilise equipment when performing home surgery
[22:52:28] <coldhead> also as anaesthetic
[22:52:35] <tw2113> i meant headcold medicine
[22:52:41] <tw2113> slight pun intended coldhead
[22:52:48] <coldhead> trepanning?

[22:53:33] <b-ot> tw2113: @tw2113: Science: Drink some whiskey when have head cold. Head cold eventually goes away. Credit whiskey. Closing argument: whiskey can be medicine
[22:54:29] <adavia> im starting to think im crazy or my operating system renders like shit but im seeing totally different font sizes in firefox and opera comparing chrome
[22:54:32] <coldhead> ah causality
[22:54:38] <abjorn> guess next time i have a head cold ill drink a fifth of jameson
[22:54:55] <tw2113> adavia, i'd blame the browser makers there
[22:55:01] <tw2113> and a bit of the os
[22:55:14] <adavia> im using linux
[22:55:18] <abjorn> could also be bad reset, or lack of one
[22:55:20] <tw2113> ah, even worse
[22:55:22] <abjorn> well theres your problem right there
[22:55:22] <tw2113> lack of fonts
[22:55:29] <abjorn> linux font rendering it lols
[22:55:31] <abjorn> *is
[22:56:05] <adavia> http://imgur.com/a/ceY3V
[22:56:37] <adavia> thats crap
[22:56:47] <tw2113> yeah, it's going to happen
[22:57:06] <tw2113> looks like font substitution
[22:57:31] <adavia> tw2113:  font size 13 is chrome is 11 in firefox
[22:57:37] <adavia> 13px
[22:58:09] <tw2113> font types aren't necessarily standardized either, and like i said, it looks like the fonts are different between "Margonari"
[22:58:21] <tw2113> notice the lack fo serif on the right side of the G
[22:58:38] <tw2113> on the bottom image
[22:58:43] <adavia> yes
[22:58:51] <abjorn> I wouldn't put it against linux to cut off the serif on the G
[22:58:52] <adavia> Also the color of the image next to
[22:58:59] <abjorn> ive seen linux font rendering do weird shit like that
[22:59:07] <tw2113> use inspector tools to see the rendered fonts
[22:59:18] <abjorn> I do think it's a font substitution, though
[22:59:21] <abjorn> just a very...good one
[22:59:26] <abjorn> you know, minus the different font size
[23:00:25] <adavia> font is the same.. what changes is size
[23:00:33] <adavia> anyways
[23:00:42] <adavia> ill check this later in windows
[23:00:58] <tw2113> don't rely on what you specified to be the font
[23:01:03] <tw2113> check computed styles
[23:20:17] <chovy> .
[23:20:49] <tw2113> choves
[23:41:30] <ashitvora> Hi Guys. I want to modify the autocomplete plugin to use it like Facebook's tagging UI. I want to trigger auto complete only when user enters # or @ and I want to trigger auto complete multiple times in the text box. how can I do that?
[23:43:42] <ravenzz> ashitvora something like this http://podio.github.io/jquery-mentions-input/ ?
[23:45:37] <ashitvora> ravenzz yes. thanks :)
[23:45:48] <ashitvora> you saved alot of my time :)
[23:46:21] <ravenzz> eheh usually it is worth to spend 10 minutes searching on google for an existing solution
