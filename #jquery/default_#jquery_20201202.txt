[02:57:42] <ijjj> :)
[02:58:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[02:59:22] <undefined_bob> lol
[02:59:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[03:00:15] <robertmaxrees> welp
[03:02:13] <undefined_bob> at least he was kind
[03:03:36] <robertmaxrees> hahaha - drive-by smilies are always a good time.
[03:04:14] <undefined_bob> yeah
[04:54:45] <martin__> Hey, how can I tackle this? https://pastebin.com/raw/wB5Vmb5Z I am checking the closest checkbox when clicking the tr row, but my change event is not triggered when I do this only  when I press the checkbox directly.
[04:56:17] <robertmaxrees> changing the prop doesn't fire the event.
[04:56:30] <robertmaxrees> abstract out that handler and call it directly instead.
[04:59:09] <robertmaxrees> martin__
[05:00:22] <Cork> alternatively there is trigger('change'), though ya it is better to not use them unless needed
[05:00:44] <robertmaxrees> ^ exactly.  avoid proxying logic through the DOM when possible.
[05:06:09] <martin__> robertmaxrees: yeah, good call. I take it from here
[15:37:03] <z1haze> if I have a variable like const myVar = $('<div id="something">blah blah</div>'); $('body').append(myVar); ... can i then access that object in the dom through myVar?
[15:37:14] <robertmaxrees> have you tried? :)
[15:43:57] <z1haze> yep
[15:44:07] <z1haze> does not work, but i think it should
[15:44:10] <z1haze> hence my asking
[15:44:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qv2wbk9a/
[15:45:08] <robertmaxrees> does work, so there's something else going on.
[15:54:03] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/wrn78pj5/3/
[15:54:36] <robertmaxrees> mind clarifying what should happen vs what's currently happening?
[15:54:51] <z1haze> swap out line 49 for $(`#${opts.id}`).modal('show') and you'll see
[15:55:15] <robertmaxrees> mind describing the bug?
[15:55:19] <z1haze> error one one, not on the other..
[15:55:38] <robertmaxrees> sure - mind describing what's happening vs what you're expecting to happen? :)
[15:56:07] <z1haze> well in the case of this fidde, the text 'some-title` should appear
[15:56:20] <robertmaxrees> it's appearing for me.
[15:56:24] <z1haze> however it gets an error of $modal.modal is not a function
[15:57:20] <z1haze> the issue is that calling $modal.modal('show') causes and error, but re-querying for the same object and calling .modal() on that, works fine
[15:57:32] <robertmaxrees> because there's no 'modal' method on strings.
[15:58:02] <robertmaxrees> woah wait $modal gets reassigned a few times.
[15:58:18] <z1haze> it does pretty much what i asked earlier, does it not?
[15:58:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:58:32] <robertmaxrees> $modal = getModalTemplate(opts); is returning a string.
[15:58:43] <z1haze> ahh ok thats my goof
[15:58:45] <z1haze> right on
[15:58:53] <robertmaxrees> even if it returned a jquery object, your code wouldn't work becuase it would be a new one each time.
[15:59:19] <z1haze> what do you mean a new one?
[15:59:35] <robertmaxrees> getModalTemplate returns a string currently.
[15:59:57] <z1haze> right
[16:00:12] <robertmaxrees> even if it returned a jquery object, once you hit $modal = getModalTemplate(opts);, $modal is now going to be a completely different jquery object.
[16:03:58] <z1haze> thats the only object i care about
[16:04:12] <z1haze> if you see all im doing before that is removing it if it exists
[16:04:31] <robertmaxrees> okay? lol
[16:05:56] <z1haze> anyway you got me what i needed, so thanks
[17:53:45] <Alina-malina> how can i force an overlay window to have a z-index and be on top of all other layers?
[17:54:07] <robertmaxrees> set its z-index to something crazy high
[17:55:01] <Alina-malina> ye i tried this .css("z-index","10000"); but it still under the top header bar
[17:55:08] <Alina-malina> its making me crazy
[17:55:08] <robertmaxrees> then z-index: 99999
[17:55:17] <robertmaxrees> but also: stacking context
[17:55:54] <Alina-malina> same with 99999
[17:55:59] <Alina-malina> stacking context?
[17:56:22] <robertmaxrees> head over to ##css ask ask about z-index and the like :)
