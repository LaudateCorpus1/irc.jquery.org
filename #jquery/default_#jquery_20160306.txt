[00:11:42] <copyjosh> acidjazz: I mean that in the public/dist/images folder, is a 'uploads' folder
[00:12:50] <copyjosh> but it's copying everything from resources/assets/images/*  and overwrites the uploads folder with a new, empty, uploads folder.
[00:14:40] <copyjosh> realizing maybe an easier fix is to just move the uploads folder out to public/uploads/ instead...
[00:16:44] <acidjazz> imagemin cool
[00:16:50] <acidjazz> does imagemin do resizing too
[00:17:34] <copyjosh> not sure, someone else i'm working with put this together

[11:03:46] <pyemkey> Hello. I'm looking for API with company list. For example I have experience tab where I can start type company name and from select I can choose company with logo. Anything?
[12:35:34] <GrundeLL> Hello, trying to create an array of items that are filtered and sorted to sent to handlebars, the problem i get is that i get double two arrays from the function returned (https://jsfiddle.net/x69kt7q1/2/) see line #42 and #69,
[12:35:45] <GrundeLL> Is anyone able to help me with this?
[12:40:16] <shoky> GrundeLL: .push doesn't return what you think it does, and it mutates the array, unlike .concat. don't know why you'd get double array tho, whatever that means
[12:44:19] <GrundeLL> shoky: So i tried both .push()/.concat() what it gives me back is the same array (in this case i have 5 matching results in "needle") https://jsfiddle.net/x69kt7q1/4/
[12:44:35] <GrundeLL> so it sends back 5 arrays that are identical...
[12:45:00] <shoky> GrundeLL: .push doesn't return an array
[12:45:20] <GrundeLL> It pushes something in to an array i assume ?
[12:45:41] <GrundeLL> There for i created an array earlier to fill with the .push
[12:45:54] <shoky> yes, and it returns the new length of the array
[12:46:01] <shoky> so if you do  item = item.push(..)
[12:46:05] <shoky> item will now be a number
[12:46:19] <GrundeLL> shoky: oh okay,
[12:47:00] <GrundeLL> shoky: so how do i loop through my sorted items find my "needle" (matching results of maturity) and send them back to an array to print out?
[12:47:27] <shoky> to push to an array you just do:  item.push(..)
[12:47:33] <shoky> that should work fine
[12:47:53] <GrundeLL> (line #40 - #59 in the sheet)
[12:48:09] <shoky> if it's not working fine, put some actual data in the fiddle so it shows the problem happening
[12:48:46] <GrundeLL> Right 2 sec
[12:49:16] <shoky> i'd prolly just use .filter  tho
[12:49:59] <shoky> for loops are nasty, hardly any reason to ever use them, especially in javascript. use .forEach/.map/.filter/.reduce
[12:50:20] <shoky> but with that said i didn't see a problem with your loop
[12:56:31] <GrundeLL> shoky: okay, so rather go foreach to make my life simpler?
[12:56:45] <GrundeLL> shoky: its a pain moving this script in to actual data...
[12:57:15] <shoky> GrundeLL: yea so you don't mess with useless indexes [i] stuff. in your case tho i think .filter will be more useful
[12:58:16] <GrundeLL> shoky: right so simply keep the first loop and then create a .filter function to get the objects with maturity that is equal to my needle?
[12:59:15] <shoky> what first loop?  i donno what you're doing with that maturityClean/Devide/Write  stuff so it's hard to answer..
[13:02:31] <GrundeLL> shoky: Sorry first i get my  #36 response and sort the list depending on the index_smalan (ie input value) from there i have a loop that loops through my sorted results #46
[13:03:02] <shoky> GrundeLL: ya so i suggested replcing the for loop with a .filter
[13:03:59] <shoky> GrundeLL: smth like..   response.sort(...);  var needles = response.filter(item => item.maturity === needle);  var needlesAnnualInterest = needles.map(item => item.annual_interest);
[13:04:11] <GrundeLL> shoky: inside that loop i do a month / year check (maturityClean #48) after that i have the loop searching for my needle (#58 sorted[i].maturity == needle)
[13:04:20] <GrundeLL> shoky: this is where the problem is
[13:04:40] <shoky> GrundeLL: your maturityClean stuff isn't ddoing anything, at least in the code you paste
[13:04:42] <shoky> pasted
[13:04:58] <shoky> GrundeLL: i've yet to see a problem (except the  item = item.push(..)  thing)
[13:05:23] <GrundeLL> shoky: nope i have cleaned the data it returns, this is the full list http://xn--norskeln-g0a.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=loan_search&amount=10000
[13:05:56] <shoky> uh ok
[13:06:26] <GrundeLL> shoky: Didn't se a reason to actually add all of it you know, just a crapload of data...
[13:07:00] <shoky> if you want us to see the problem, you'll need to add some data ;p
[13:08:06] <GrundeLL> yeah, hmm... let me try a thing,
[13:15:37] <GrundeLL> shoky: right this is a bit fucked up...
[13:15:57] <GrundeLL> shoky: http://xn--norskeln-g0a.com/smalan/ it you check the console i logged the results
[13:16:27] <GrundeLL> On the server it only gives me one array, while my local env gives me 5
[13:16:54] <shoky> GrundeLL: uh i'm not gonna look at minified code, thanks ;p
[13:18:28] <GrundeLL> no just the console,
[13:18:50] <GrundeLL> did a console.log(item); as i have it on my local...
[13:18:57] <GrundeLL> shoky: but anyway...
[13:19:46] <shoky> still don't see any problem
[13:21:04] <GrundeLL> yeah the thing that was weird... I get one array of 5 items in the production, while i get 5 in local
[13:21:42] <shoky> donno what you expect us to do about it ;p
[13:26:07] <GrundeLL> shoky: i have no idea ;) Im trying to recreate the problem in a fiddle atm
[13:26:18] <GrundeLL> shoky: ill get back when im there :D
[13:26:27] <shoky> :)
[16:47:14] <Wayland> Hey! I need some help.
[16:48:17] <Wayland> Is there a way to register a click event only when its not in any element?
[16:49:53] <shoky> meaning what?
[16:52:59] <Ichy> Hello, i need some help.
[16:57:29] <Ichy> ... Anyone?
[16:57:59] <shoky> you might want to ask your question. though you already did and i responded: <shoky> meaning what?
[16:58:43] <Ichy> shoky: Lol, that didn't appear on my IRC.
[16:59:11] <Ichy> Anyways, is there a way to listen to a click event on the document only if its not clicking in a element?
[16:59:22] <Ichy> Like, clicking the BG = Listen
[16:59:31] <Ichy> Clicking in a <p> = Not Listen
[17:00:40] <shoky> Ichy: you can catch click events on the element and call .stopPropagation() on the event argument, so it doesn't bubble up to document
[17:01:04] <shoky> or you can check event.target on the document click
[17:01:17] <Ichy> shoky: Thanks!
[17:57:38] <elGr33k0> Hello
[17:58:06] <elGr33k0> I have this css celector
[17:58:09] <elGr33k0> selector
[17:58:10] <elGr33k0> #main > div > div > div > div.col.col-content > div.product-list > div > ul > li:nth-child(1) > div.head > h2 > a > span.name
[17:58:24] <elGr33k0> and i want to get all elemets of a webpage that share it.
[17:58:28] <elGr33k0> with jquery
[18:03:22] <sadtaco> jesus that's a long selector
[18:03:59] <elGr33k0> it is ;)
[18:04:09] <elGr33k0> actually the site is invia.cz
[18:04:16] <elGr33k0> if you inspect the element
[18:04:21] <elGr33k0> there is a line that says
[18:05:25] <elGr33k0> http://dovolena.invia.cz/?nl_country_id%5B%5D=28&nl_country_id%5B%5D=28&nl_locality_id%5B%5D=21&d_start_from=03.06.2016&d_end_to=13.06.2016&nl_length_int%5B%5D=7%7C9&nl_transportation_id%5B%5D=3_1&nl_transportation_id%5B%5D=3_2
[18:05:29] <elGr33k0> this is the link
[18:06:15] <elGr33k0> if you inspect the li.item.hotel-box
[18:06:26] <elGr33k0> you will see that the hotel summetime village has a code prefix
[18:06:39] <elGr33k0> 46475
[18:06:44] <elGr33k0> this is an identifier
[18:07:13] <elGr33k0> I need to extract this element and the css channel send me to you guys
[18:08:20] <sadtaco> I don't see the code prefix
[18:09:10] <elGr33k0> {"id":"899072","name":"46475 - Summertime Apartments","dimension7":"Corfu","dimension8":"Greece","dimension9":"Air conditioning, Bar\/minibar, Calm location, Outdoor pool, Sport activities, Suitable for children, Wifi internet","dimension13":"7.2","dimension15":"3","dimension19":"11390"}
[18:09:11] <sadtaco> But if you want to get all the span.name like that first one why dont you just "#main div.product-list li> div.head > h2 > a > span.name"?
[18:09:46] <sadtaco> Then look for .closest('.hotel-box').attr('data-ua')
[18:10:03] <elGr33k0> how can i type that at the console to export that ?
[18:10:26] <shoky> better to use .data    .closest('.hotel-box').data('ua').name
[18:10:45] <elGr33k0> but in chrome the console needs a $........
[18:10:56] <shoky> elGr33k0: $(selector)
[18:12:02] <shoky> to get all those ids - $('.hotel-box').map(function() { return parseInt($(this).data('ua').name,10) })
[18:12:39] <elGr33k0> that is what I was looking for :)
[18:12:45] <elGr33k0> Thank you Shoky
[18:18:09] <elGr33k0> last question
[18:18:12] <elGr33k0> not to be greede
[18:18:15] <elGr33k0> greedy :D
[18:18:27] <elGr33k0> is there a way to download those results to a json?
[18:18:30] <elGr33k0> or csv?
[18:20:17] <shoky> elGr33k0: var ids = $(..).map(..);   var json = JSON.stringify(ids);   from the console if you want to copy it to clipboard you can write  copy(json)
[18:20:30] <shoky> and you can save that to a file ;p
[18:20:50] <elGr33k0> I owe you big time
[18:21:10] <elGr33k0> how can i repay you?
[18:21:33] <shoky> your thanks is good :)

[21:29:43] <amincd> hi, how can I load the content of a local file using jQuery without running a webserver?
[21:31:25] <amincd> Or alternatively, how can I load the HTML content of a http:// file without running a webserver? When I try to access an external page, I get this error: XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://website-URL. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
[22:14:34] <sadtaco> amincd, have all the resources locally like the html page
[22:14:52] <amincd> sadtaco: I do
[23:30:26] <amincd> how do I load the content of a local text file? .load?
[23:34:57] <NotreDev> i’m building a third-party js widget. i’m attempting to load jquery into my namespaced object. I’m successfully doing this, but i’m also polluting the global namespace for $ and jQuery. How should I prevent those variables from being created?
[23:36:54] <NotreDev> this is what I have; http://pastebin.com/EYKXsZ3H
[23:37:35] <NotreDev> i want to believe it’s as simple as commenting out lines 18-20, but I feel like i should instead be setting “noGlobal”
