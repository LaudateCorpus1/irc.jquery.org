[00:32:19] <jak2000> hi all
[00:32:41] <jak2000> how to get the name of class clicked? same as: var xId=$(this).attr('id');   ?
[00:54:17] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 "of the class clicked"?  .prop('class')
[00:54:26] <robertmaxrees> though that may or may not be what you want.
[01:08:13] <jak2000> testing
[01:09:04] <robertmaxrees> ?
[01:17:04] <jak2000> the button have these classes: btn-mini btn-block clchkEmbF01
[01:17:31] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 cool.
[01:17:37] <Cork> are you looking for .hasClass() ?
[01:17:40] <jak2000> $(document).on("click", ".clchkEmbF01", function () { var xClass=$(this).prop('class');   alert(xClass);  show: "btn-mini btn-block clchkEmbF01"  only want to know: clchkEmbF01
[01:17:57] <robertmaxrees> erm,
[01:18:06] <robertmaxrees> if that event handler fired, it has that class.
[01:19:03] <jak2000> the alert... i want only display clchkEmbF01
[01:19:17] <robertmaxrees> super confused lol
[01:19:18] <robertmaxrees> jha
[01:19:49] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what makes that particular class important?  why do you want to "alert" it?
[01:20:30] <jak2000> the alert is innecesary...
[01:20:35] <jak2000> my final goal is:
[01:21:02] <jak2000> $(document).on("click", ".clchkEmbF01, .clchkEmbF02, .clchkEmbF03, .clchkEmbFormat67", function () {
[01:21:18] <jak2000> if user click on clchkEmbF03 i want to know wich class was clicked....
[01:21:21] <robertmaxrees> are you doing to do something different for each one of those?
[01:21:26] <robertmaxrees> *going to do
[01:22:24] <robertmaxrees> depending, you either want .hasClass(), or re-factor youur code into separate event handlers since that seems like what you really want.
[01:22:48] <Cork> or use a data-clckEmb="F02" attribute
[01:22:53] <robertmaxrees> ^
[01:22:55] <jak2000> i have in this funciton so so 20 lines.... the 3rd change.....
[01:22:59] <jak2000> ok data- interesting
[01:23:01] <jak2000> okay
[01:23:22] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 there are a ton of ways to build what you want in an abstracted way so you aren't repeating a bunch of code :)
[01:23:27] <Cork> then you just need one class
[01:38:41] <jak2000> <button type='button' class='btn-mini btn-block clchkEmbF01' data-servlet='servletEmbF01'>..</button>
[01:38:54] <jak2000> how to get data  value?
[01:39:03] <robertmaxrees> .data('servlet')
[01:39:07] <Cork> or .attr('data-servlet')
[01:39:25] <robertmaxrees> just be consistent with what you choose.
[01:56:18] <jak2000> thx
[01:56:22] <jak2000> test
[01:56:58] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep saying "test"?
[02:06:25] <jak2000> done thanks
[02:06:59] <robertmaxrees> ? lol k
[10:25:56] <michael28> Hello, is the jqueryui download offline? I've been trying to download it since last week
[11:10:21] <kittonian> hi all. what am I missing here? I am trying to change the button text to say logging in when clicked. I can get the background color to change just fine but not the innerHTML. https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/RwaxmjW
[11:16:36] <kittonian> nevermind. jquery wants .html not innerHTML. got it working
[23:12:56] <TMC> Hi
[23:13:07] <robertmaxrees> good evening.
[23:13:46] <TMC> robertmaxrees how are you?
[23:14:01] <robertmaxrees> well enough.
[23:14:55] <TMC> you can help me with a somewhat confusing matter
[23:15:32] <robertmaxrees> that's the point of the channel - if you haev a question, just ask.  if somebody can help, they will :)
[23:15:39] <TMC> https://jsfiddle.net/caacastellanosc/7gmcL6wy/1/
[23:16:23] <robertmaxrees> ?
[23:16:25] <TMC> It only works for me in jsfiddle and codepen, if you do the exercise of paar it to a compound html it does not work
[23:16:52] <robertmaxrees> "compound html?
[23:16:57] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow.
[23:17:42] <TMC> create only html
[23:17:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[23:17:57] <Obsdark> people, i'm trying to jump from one part of a page to another without making a click but still can't manage to make it work, this is the code, what i'm doing wrong and how can i fix it? https://jsfiddle.net/qzxbL63a/1/
[23:18:08] <robertmaxrees> TMC can you be more specific?  maybe show it not working?
[23:18:16] <TMC> I need to make it work in a single html
[23:18:41] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark how do I replicate your issue?
[23:18:54] <Obsdark> in the jsfiddle
[23:18:57] <Obsdark> all is there
[23:19:07] <Obsdark> it should load and go to the place but it doesn't
[23:19:12] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark your first issue is you don't have jquery included - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gh18xfzr/
[23:19:24] <robertmaxrees> second issue is $("#marcaJump" + $("#bufferPart").val()).offset().top isn't working.
[23:19:29] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do with that?
[23:20:09] <Obsdark> well, what i'm really trying to do is make than, when a function is called, the page jump to a location on itself
[23:20:20] <Obsdark> without the need of a click from part of the user
[23:20:51] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark yeah, you're not selecting anything with $("#marcaJump" + $("#bufferPart").val()) :)
[23:20:52] <Obsdark> it doesn't not need to be triggered by a click, certainly, so if there is another option to achieve this could be fine too
[23:21:22] <Obsdark> right, sorry, the bufferpart is part of the original script
[23:22:03] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark so - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gh18xfzr/3/
[23:22:07] <robertmaxrees> does this not do what you want?
[23:22:54] <Obsdark> it doesn't generate the jump at the moment i enter it
[23:23:19] <Obsdark> let asume a number in the bufferPart
[23:23:20] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark that's working fine here :shrug:
[23:23:27] <Obsdark> well, that's intresting
[23:23:46] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark try this one: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gh18xfzr/7/
[23:24:18] <Obsdark> wonderfull, thank you robertmaxrees
[23:24:25] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark i didn't do anything special.
[23:24:26] <Obsdark> that last one actualy work :)
[23:24:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because i fixed that selector.
[23:25:06] <robertmaxrees> sounds like #bufferPart doesn't have a value.
[23:25:43] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gh18xfzr/9/
[23:26:04] <robertmaxrees> though this seems kind of strange.  why go through a click handler?
[23:27:02] <robertmaxrees> can just do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gh18xfzr/10/
[23:28:08] <Obsdark> the idea was to actualy use an a like button to generate the movement
[23:28:11] <TMC> robertmaxrees do not forget me
[23:28:31] <robertmaxrees> TMC i asked you a question earlier - need you to show it not working before i can help.
[23:28:39] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark huh?
[23:28:52] <Obsdark> an hyperlink
[23:29:02] <Obsdark> for make the jump, that was the think i though in the moment
[23:29:11] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark there's a much easier way to do that.
[23:29:19] <Obsdark> so the marc one is the actual place to go, and the source is, well, for activate
[23:29:20] <Obsdark> really?
[23:29:30] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark i assume you want the slow scroll animation?
[23:29:40] <Obsdark> not really, but i think it would be a plus
[23:29:51] <Obsdark> not necesary tho
[23:29:51] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark that's default browser behavior without the animation :)
[23:30:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gh18xfzr/11/ :)
[23:30:22] <Obsdark> xD
[23:30:35] <robertmaxrees> if the animation is important, then it's pretty simple.  one sec.
[23:30:45] <Obsdark> ok, i get it, i mean i need to provoke the movement without the user intervention
[23:30:59] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark then use a hash in the URL.
[23:31:13] <robertmaxrees> literally append #marcaJump1 to the link and you're done.
[23:31:19] <TMC> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/caacastellanosc/7gmcL6wy/3/
[23:31:44] <robertmaxrees> TMC that seems to work fine here :shrug:
[23:31:46] <Obsdark> will try, now that you said it i don't know why i don't think on that before, thanks robertmaxrees
[23:31:53] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark def :)
[23:32:03] <TMC> If you copy what's in html and post it locally, it doesn't show the videos, it keeps loading
[23:32:19] <robertmaxrees> TMC are you just editing a file you have open in a browser?
[23:32:23] <robertmaxrees> ie not running a server locally?
[23:33:17] <TMC> exact, no server
[23:33:25] <robertmaxrees> that's why.,
[23:33:51] <robertmaxrees> at the very least, those relative urls (like '//www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems';) aren't able to work when you're not running on a server.
[23:34:17] <robertmaxrees> gotta fully qualify them, though even then that may not work.
[23:35:42] <TMC> como podria hacerlo funcionar?
[23:35:55] <TMC> how could i make it work?
[23:36:12] <robertmaxrees> you need to change those relative URLs to be absolute.
[23:36:40] <robertmaxrees> so any time a URL starts with //www. you need to add a protocol to the front, so make it http://www.
[23:36:44] <robertmaxrees> err, https://
[23:36:49] <robertmaxrees> you get the idea.
[23:37:00] <robertmaxrees> and make sure you include jquery, have a valid document, etc.
[23:37:29] <robertmaxrees> so you need something like https://bpa.st/WRVQ
[23:37:39] <robertmaxrees> or do the right thing and setup a local development server.
[23:38:35] <TMC> wow perfect
[23:38:55] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what your issue was now?
[23:39:03] <TMC> yes
[23:39:10] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[23:39:14] <TMC> https no get
[23:39:22] <TMC> get //googleapis....
[23:39:24] <TMC> one last favor, i need to make it responsive
[23:39:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[23:39:35] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[23:40:02] <TMC> bootstrap ?
[23:40:24] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[23:40:40] <robertmaxrees> or learn responsive css.
[23:47:29] <TMC> a little help
[23:47:36] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[23:48:25] <Obsdark> finally i fix it with a document.getBlablabla.scrollIntoView() because i see than the url solution can't be done because other contrains
[23:48:43] <Obsdark> but thanks robertmaxrees, you help me a lot in finding the answer :)
[23:48:45] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark what other constraints?
[23:49:10] <Obsdark> in my module i just have the front end of the application, and pass things through get wasn't an option
[23:49:27] <robertmaxrees> hrm, ok.
[23:49:30] <Obsdark> by request that is, so i cannot deliver that solution
[23:49:50] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  alright.
[23:49:52] <Obsdark> but hey, thanks a lot (y) (y)
[23:57:19] <TMC> http://www.consorcioibinesferreo.com
[23:57:27] <robertmaxrees> that's not a question.
