[01:07:49] <Aashrith> Hi
[03:02:29] <Chulbul> TypeError: document.getElementById(...) is null , what is the easiest way to find why this error is happening and how to resolve it.
[03:05:28] <Chulbul> var feeObj = document.getElementById(feetype); this is where it says null value but when I alert 'feetype' it displays value.
[03:05:46] <Chulbul> but its returning TypeError: document.getElementById(...) is null

[03:55:38] <silverdust> Anyone here?
[03:56:55] <silverdust> I want to know how best I can handle having an element like a dropdown or modal that can be closed by clicking any other part of the document body but itself
[03:57:59] <silverdust> I'd do $("body:not('.myDropDown')").click(function(){ // close dropdown });
[03:59:03] <silverdust> but I already have an event $('.myDropDownInit').click(function(){ // toggleVisibility });
[03:59:47] <silverdust> Now is there a way to contain the former even within this single event such that it will be triggered to close if any other thing is clicked but it
[04:03:57] <arc_> you can't use a visibility toggle because you aren't using the same event to trigger show and hide, so you need different logic for each one
[04:07:24] <arc_> so basically just bind whatever you click to show the menu and use show(), and then bind a click event to document with something like ... if (!$(this).closest('#yourmenu').length) { if ($('#yourmenu').is(':visible')) { $('#yourmenu').hide(); } }
[04:08:20] <arc_> the first if statement tests if #yourmenu is not an ancestor of the element that was clicked
[04:10:49] <arc_> (silverdust)
[04:11:32] <silverdust> yes that makes sense. I'm still trying to understand !$(this).closest('#yourmenu).length role
[04:12:07] <silverdust> .closest() gets the menu's ancestors
[04:12:28] <silverdust> and body is an ancestor to the menu
[04:12:44] <arc_> when you are using a click event, $(this) returns the element that was clicked on
[04:13:01] <arc_> so if you click on a menu item, #yourmenu is an ancestor of that
[04:13:15] <arc_> which means it will NOT hide the menu
[04:13:32] <arc_> if you click somewhere else, #yourmenu is not an ancestor, which means it will hide the menu
[04:13:47] <silverdust> okay that makes complete sense now. Thanks
[04:13:54] <arc_> you're welcome
[04:44:14] <Qria> Hello, is it possible to prompt file upload and then send it to server with a single click on a image? I've heard that it might by impossible because of security reasons and I would like to know if it is possible before I delve into implementing it.
[04:59:42] <KnightsOfNi> does anyone know how to do this https://rosspenman.com/pushstate-jquery/ but with keeping the current page as a dimmed background?

[06:18:04] <afidegnum> hello good morning all,
[06:18:50] <afidegnum> what jquery libraries can I use to display maps of States, Counties, cities? a kind of hierarchical display.
[07:02:10] <Seswu> Does anyone know how to turn caching off? :]
[07:13:43] <phyrexia> How do I get the contents of scriptOutput?? https://dpaste.de/trx7
[07:13:55] <phyrexia> scriptOutput contains several HTML tags such as <br/> and </p>
[07:17:39] <shoky> .html()
[07:18:41] <Seswu> @phyrexia Unless you can path into it with $table/h3/tbody/tr/td/p or something, I have no idea sorry. Beginner here :]
[07:18:57] <phyrexia> shoky: what do u mean .html()?
[07:19:23] <phyrexia> Seswu: I can path into it, it just stops getting the text once it hits a HTML tag.
[07:19:33] <phyrexia> I tried using |striptags (included in django to remove HTML tags) and it does not work either
[07:19:48] <shoky> phyrexia: .html() gets you the contents including html tags such as <br> and <p>
[07:20:02] <shoky> which is what i thought you wanted. guess not though..
[07:20:52] <phyrexia> It's fine if the HTML tags come along, I don't mind.
[07:20:59] <phyrexia> Yet it does not work.
[07:21:04] <shoky> your html has lots of errors btw
[07:21:12] <phyrexia> I'm aware of that.
[07:22:16] <shoky> is your selector right?  you're doing  $("#table"+id+ ...   while your table id is  table-id ...
[07:24:05] <shoky> also you're going over ALL td's and getting scriptName-* and scriptOutput-* from each TD, but each td has only one of those..

[08:14:22] <asdad> hello
[08:14:24] <asdad> just out of curiosity, how much would it cost to build an web-based application that allows customers to design a car?
[08:20:02] <hellyeah> hey,
[08:20:32] <hellyeah> can yo look at line 17 why i cannot give text to buttonText https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/13/
[08:25:59] <stg934> Hello, can someone help me, why there is always false existance variable even when i give a real name? there is the paste http://pastebin.com/MepNrYtz
[08:26:16] <shoky> hellyeah: $('.buttonText')  searches the page's current DOM, but it's not in the DOM yet.  you probably want row.find('.buttonText').text(i);
[08:27:33] <shoky> stg934: line 13 happens much earlier than line 8. because line 13 happens much earlier than when the ajax callback is called. ajax is asynchronous
[08:27:34] <hellyeah> but i used html() before giving its name
[08:27:40] <hellyeah> it is not in dom
[08:27:42] <hellyeah> mm
[08:27:56] <hellyeah> i suppose html method will construct dom tree
[08:28:57] <shoky> hellyeah: that's why i said "the page's current DOM", i.e. a descendant of `document`
[08:29:20] <shoky> it's only part of the document after you append it to some element in the document
[08:29:56] <stg934> shoky, then when am I supposed to return this value or when can it understand that my value change?
[08:30:42] <shoky> stg934: you are not supposed to return that value. whatever you want to happen in response to the ajax request, has to happen inside the success callback
[08:31:43] <stg934> Is it ok if the value is returned inside the if statement?
[08:31:46] <shoky> can also use the promises API to make it nicer  e.g.   var request = $.getJSON(...);  return request;     then somewhere else    request.done(function(data) { ... })
[08:31:59] <shoky> stg934: no. you are NOT supposed to return that value, period.
[08:32:30] <shoky> this is what it means that ajax is asynchronous.  stuff happens only later in the callback
[08:32:36] <hellyeah> shoky: thanks
[08:46:46] <JanusPatrus> guys, do you take notes while reading tech books&
[08:46:54] <JanusPatrus> ?
[08:54:05] <stg934> shoky, I tried to rewrite it but still dont work : http://pastebin.com/ifEec6DF
[08:55:31] <stg934> Is it impossible to change my var to true when doing the function?
[08:57:13] <shoky> it's possible, but you'll only see the new value if you check it AFTER it has changed.  which will only be much later, and you can only know when that is inside the callback. so returning anything from it to outside is useless because the stuff outside has already finished running much earlier
[08:57:33] <shoky> just do whatever you want to happen, INSIDE the callback
[08:57:40] <shoky> if you do that, everything will work fine.
[08:58:05] <shoky> dont try to return stuff from inside it to outside. just do stuff inside.  i'm off, good luck ;p
[09:00:23] <stg934> what can i do to have a function that return true (or false)???\
[09:01:01] <stg934> it's weid that the code isnt executed line by line
[09:01:48] <shoky> no it's not weird. that's how asynchronous code is. think of it like events.. the ajax callback is an event handler. it only runs much later, when the event actually happens.
[09:02:16] <shoky> you don't return true or false. you just do whatever you wanted to do with that return value, inside ;p  now i'm really off.
[09:02:34] <stg934> i can do a if(the code is executed)
[09:02:53] <shoky> thinking about it the old way will get you nowhere buddy
[09:03:17] <shoky> re-read everything i said a couple times.  put console.log's in different places in the code to see the behaviour. bye ;)
[09:06:14] <km4> guys I need show this.select.$el.show(); this but reverse, select is my array
[09:12:48] <slax0r> I want to identify on which part the mouse cursor currently is in an image, is html map, and jquery mouse position with predefined sections the only option?
[09:17:33] <jmdrawne_> When targeting an element that doesn't have something unique to use as a selector, what is the best(performance wise?) way to target it? ie jQuery('#id fieldset').length; or jQuery('#id).find(fieldset').length;  Is there a performance difference?
[09:29:25] <savitha> How to use .css()? help me

[09:33:30] <CausaMortis> anyone here that can put event delegation into a ELI5 answer for me? I dont fully understand why $(document).on('blur', '.custom-broker-field', function() {} works on all my custom-broker-fields (some of which are added dynamically) but a handler attached the element itself does not
[09:35:03] <CausaMortis> 'Direct events are only attached to elements at the time the .on() method is called.' still dont get it :S how is that on not called when I append element with said class?
[10:09:24] <Simplar> Hello. I'm using ddSlick: http://designwithpc.com/plugins/ddslick#demo  || How to print something which is stored as 'data'? Thanks!
[10:17:53] <afidegnum> hello, i m still not been able to work it out
[10:18:26] <afidegnum> I have a current data in the database but how do i build my migration? do I use db init? or db.create_all()?
[11:04:17] <afidegnum> hello, i m stil having errors about sqlmigrations already exists, any hint please?
[11:06:34] <taplar> what is that?
[11:07:10] <taplar> doesn't should like a jquery thing
[11:21:38] <afidegnum> hello, pls when i run the db upgrade on sqlalchemy, it has created new columns instead of using existing ones, how do i transfer data from one cells to the new ones?
[11:22:27] <taplar> afidegnum:you didn't answer my previous question.  what is sqlmigrations?
[11:22:43] <afidegnum> sorry sorry sorry
[11:22:46] <afidegnum> wrong room
[11:27:54] <lindii_> am i doing this correctly https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/15422/
[11:29:52] <taplar> lindii_:what are you concerned about?
[11:30:36] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ how are you submitting the form?  ajax?
[11:31:29] <taplar> there doesn't appear to be any actual error checking.  it's just putting the errors on the fields regardlessly
[11:31:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:31:49] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: yes
[11:32:20] <lindii_> taplar: well just checking if theres a better way to do that
[11:32:28] <taplar> 'that' ?
[11:32:46] <taplar> what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:32:50] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ do what?  you're not event validating anything.
[11:32:58] <lindii_> i mean to match the json errors with each input field
[11:32:58] <robertmaxrees> you're saying "if this field exists, mark it as an error.
[11:33:16] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ oh, use selectors instead.
[11:33:17] <taplar> so is 'errors' a dummy variable for this fiddle?
[11:33:41] <lindii_> taplar:  yes.. the json comes from an ajax response
[11:33:45] <robertmaxrees> nesting enumerators is a bad idea.
[11:33:48] <taplar> ahh, makes more sense
[11:34:57] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: you mean selector for the form?
[11:35:04] <robertmaxrees> for the fields.
[11:35:17] <robertmaxrees> you're basically doing a whole lot of extra work for no reason.
[11:35:55] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/15450/ for a starter
[11:36:02] <robertmaxrees> your errors object should probably be an array whose objects have the error message, validation information, and a unique selector for the element it's related to.
[11:36:59] <lindii_> taplar: thats is showing duplicate errors on each field
[11:37:07] <taplar> i left in the original logic
[11:37:21] <taplar> just so you could see both
[11:37:27] <lindii_> ohh ok
[11:38:02] <lindii_> taplar: so that ex is what robertmaxrees is referencing?
[11:38:12] <robertmaxrees> not entirely.
[11:38:21] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't have my other suggestion, but close.
[11:38:42] <taplar> yeah, it's just a first step.  probably other refactors could make it better
[11:39:34] <lindii_> looks like a better apporach
[11:39:42] <lindii_> approach
[11:39:47] <robertmaxrees> that way you don't have to work as hard.
[11:42:01] <lindii_> thanks guys
[11:42:13] <taplar> happy holidays
[12:50:22] <taplar> so dead during the holidays
[12:50:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:15:40] <Uhkis> or just the moday effect
[13:15:56] <robertmaxrees> nah, about 50 fewer people are logged right now.
[13:16:03] <taplar> manic monday?
[13:17:01] <decx> you helped all the people
[13:17:07] <decx> gotta wait for new ones to get born
[13:17:14] <robertmaxrees> welp time to pack it in.
[13:17:16] <Uhkis> :D
[13:17:17] <robertmaxrees> that was it - good run smellas.
[13:17:22] <taplar> lol.  achievement obtained!
[13:17:25] <decx> ththththththat's all folks
[13:29:44] <z1haze> can someone please explain what determines failure() coming from ajax?
[13:29:53] <robertmaxrees> failure or fail?
[13:30:06] <z1haze> well in ajax there is a success function and failure
[13:30:18] <z1haze> i dont understand how to write my php in order to return the proper 'failure' message
[13:30:29] <robertmaxrees> there is no "failure" - there's success/error and done/fail
[13:30:31] <z1haze> or error:
[13:30:36] <z1haze> sorry, error
[13:30:45] <robertmaxrees> and that's based on error codes/data validityu.
[13:31:37] <z1haze> so like
[13:31:41] <z1haze> if theres an exception thrown
[13:31:51] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating it.
[13:31:57] <robertmaxrees> it depends on the response code in that case.
[13:32:03] <z1haze> ah
[13:32:05] <z1haze> perfect
[13:32:10] <robertmaxrees> your box could throw an exception but return a 200 ;)
[13:32:10] <z1haze> thats all i needed xD
[13:32:14] <robertmaxrees> that that it should.
[13:32:17] <robertmaxrees> *not that
[13:32:30] <z1haze> thank you
[13:33:12] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src/ajax you can walk the code and see what's going on yourself.
[13:36:31] <taplar> z1haze:are you familiar with how to set the response code?
[13:36:46] <z1haze> yep
[13:36:49] <taplar> k
[14:55:54] <eindoofus> hi, how can one persist data locally even after the browser is closed? just need for store a few string variables
[14:56:58] <taplar> eindoofus:cookies or localSession
[14:57:12] <taplar> err, localStorage
[14:57:21] <eindoofus> taplar, what's the lifetime of localStorage?
[14:57:32] <taplar> localStorage acts like a cookie
[14:57:58] <eindoofus> taplar, guessing it's not cleared out when a user clears out cookies from their browser?
[14:58:10] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
[14:58:40] <eindoofus> thanks
[15:02:30] <_TWG_> Is there something else I should be using instead of .done in my code?
[15:03:06] <taplar> what are you using it for?
[15:03:10] <decx> depends, maybe you want to reset some things regardless of success or failure, then you'd have .always()
[15:04:02] <_TWG_> Well I'm calling some code to query data out of a CSV to return to an array in my angular $scope
[15:04:49] <taplar> so when should that logic happen?  good case?  bad case?  always?
[15:05:04] <_TWG_> always
[15:05:12] <_TWG_> here is my code so far.  https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/ax6p1e7n/3/#&togetherjs=TPwUJ9qhL5
[15:07:11] <taplar> i think your actually after the good case, in which done() is what you want
[15:08:08] <taplar> though can i say it looks a bit strange that your doing the same ajax call over and over
[15:08:38] <_TWG_> Well I needed to do it on 12 different CSV files.  One for each month.
[15:08:51] <_TWG_> This is my first attempt at this so I'm trying to learn as I go.
[15:09:05] <taplar> ah
[15:09:16] <_TWG_> Is there a better way to do it?
[15:09:46] <taplar> nah, you just have the '' on all the method invocations so that was throwing me off
[15:10:29] <_TWG_> taplar are you very familiar with angular?
[15:10:46] <taplar> not yet, :)
[15:11:13] <_TWG_> okay.  running into an issue where I don't think my data going through the 3 functions is returning correctly.
[15:11:40] <taplar> well another thing your not doing a return of the CSV2JSON(data); results
[15:11:52] <taplar> that function returns something, but the done doesn't
[15:12:29] <taplar> though thinking about that more, that seems odd with the deferred
[15:13:37] <taplar> you may have to rethink this approach.  you may have to do all your calls and wait for them to finish before building your object
[15:13:47] <_TWG_> I've been trying to piece things together from the web.  like I said I'm pretty new at jquery
[15:14:00] <taplar> look at it this way
[15:14:07] <taplar> the ajax call is returning a deferred
[15:14:14] <taplar> meaning it will finish *someday*
[15:14:22] <taplar> to which your attaching a done handler to it
[15:14:30] <taplar> and that is being assigned to your 'data' elements
[15:14:40] <taplar> but, i believe, what your really after is the result of the done callback
[15:14:51] <_TWG_> Yes that is what I want.
[15:15:17] <taplar> so yeah, your probably going to have to execute those ajax calls and set those data elements after they are done
[15:15:44] <_TWG_> Okay.  So should I just ready everything into a temp array and then load the $scope based on it?
[15:16:03] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3709597/wait-until-all-jquery-ajax-requests-are-done
[15:17:26] <_TWG_> Awesome taplar, I will into that.  Thanks for the help
[15:17:32] <taplar> np
[15:20:13] <eindoofus> i'm a bit new to jquery plugins, is there a downloadable js file for this?:
[15:20:16] <eindoofus> https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie
[15:20:52] <eindoofus> seems odd that i would need to compile or install, or do anything besides copy a js file for a plugin. a bit confused
[15:21:25] <taplar> i believe you can just download the js.cookie.js from the src directory
[15:22:50] <eindoofus> that's a lot more convinient. thanks
[15:23:04] <taplar> btw, if you end up using that make sure to minify it
[15:32:57] <ABM_Dan> Say I want to create a plugin with only one parameter, can I pass it without passing an entire object?
[15:33:39] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:33:58] <ABM_Dan> How does that work?
[15:34:12] <robertmaxrees> you just pass in the argument.
[15:34:22] <robertmaxrees> and have it be whatever value, instead of using an object.
[15:36:03] <gagi> Hey guys, need some help with an assignment, It was suppose to be an easy one but got me really confused, help will be really appreciated.
[15:36:08] <gagi> http://pastebin.com/WsGLRNsN
[15:36:11] <robertmaxrees> gagi jsut ask your question.
[15:36:33] <gagi> it's too long , it's easier to show....
[15:36:33] <_TWG_> still on taplar
[15:36:41] <robertmaxrees> gagi then make a fiddle.
[15:36:43] <taplar> yup
[15:36:53] <robertmaxrees> gagi ask pointed questions - we can't read your mind.
[15:37:16] <gagi> ok, one sec
[15:37:22] <_TWG_> I updated that link with the link to the CSV file.  You can see now what it's doing on all of the tabs except for the "Dec" since it's getting hardcoded JSON.
[15:37:39] <taplar> share the link again?
[15:38:03] <_TWG_> https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/ax6p1e7n/3/#&togetherjs=TPwUJ9qhL5
[15:39:10] <taplar> k.  did you have a question or?
[15:39:38] <_TWG_> I'm trying to figure out right now why some rows are populated but blank on each tab.
[15:40:17] <taplar> you still have your deferreds assigned to your data elements
[15:40:25] <robertmaxrees> gagi so start with your first question.
[15:40:42] <_TWG_> yeah.  I was about to start trying to figure that part out.
[15:44:02] <gagi> I am trying to select links that there href attribute is "#" and there siblings anchers href attribute is the current pages, and also ones that don't have siblings but are the current page. I hope it makes some sense.
[15:44:17] <robertmaxrees> start with that first one.
[15:44:54] <gagi> https://jsfiddle.net/dxu0arvp/
[15:46:07] <_TWG_> taplar so I'm looking at the $.when() function but I'm not sure where I would put it.  The $.ajax(); call is called inside the $scope.
[15:46:09] <robertmaxrees> missing jquery in there - also missing a closing } gag
[15:46:11] <robertmaxrees> *gagi
[15:46:25] <gagi> oops.
[15:46:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zjary7u9/1/ added here - so using this example, what links should have a red border?
[15:47:15] <robertmaxrees> like, let's say the path is 'html_query&cat_id', what should be active in that case?
[15:47:18] <sportman> is there an alternative to .html() to store a div in a javascript opbject?
[15:47:23] <taplar> _TWG_: so all your getCSV() methods are returning the deferreds that you need to wait on
[15:47:32] <robertmaxrees> sportman what do you mean?
[15:47:56] <sportman> i have an undo feature that basically works by grabbingt he html of the form before edit and when undo is clicked it just replaces the html with the original that was stored in a global var
[15:47:58] <_TWG_> yes taplar
[15:48:15] <sportman> but for some reason when i try and refresh the .html() it always shows the first stored until a page refresh happens
[15:48:22] <taplar> _TWG_: so you can make all of those and use the returned deferreds in the $.when()
[15:48:30] <sportman> robertmaxrees ill just make a quick js fiddle
[15:48:40] <robertmaxrees> sportman i'd have to see it, but it sounds like you need to create an array of objects to work with instead.
[15:48:43] <gagi> the first "fathers" of the selected second links.
[15:48:46] <robertmaxrees> and let that be your back/forth.
[15:48:53] <gagi> "father"
[15:49:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zjary7u9/2/ gagi so here - what should actually be highlighted?
[15:49:27] <robertmaxrees> the "some cat name" that's the "parent" of those "some subcat name"s that are highlighted there?
[15:52:09] <gagi> https://jsfiddle.net/zjary7u9/3/ updated the example hope it's a little more clear
[15:52:54] <robertmaxrees> that's actually more confusing.
[15:53:09] <robertmaxrees> could you describe the use case here maybe?>
[15:57:28] <gagi> Ok I'll try, let say that you have a navigation bar, and you have some dropdowns which are links but just href="#" , in those dropdowns you have links that are actually the links of pages you can go to, I need to somehow make the link that have "#" which is the first ancestor of the link that I clicked(the page I am on) be "active"/selected.
[15:57:40] <gagi> that's the first part.
[15:58:04] <robertmaxrees> okay - let's start there.
[15:59:24] <robertmaxrees> are you allowed to change the html?
[15:59:49] <gagi> not by much...
[15:59:52] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm, no need.
[15:59:56] <robertmaxrees> you alreayd have the classes you need.
[16:00:03] <gagi> yeah
[16:00:12] <gagi> I guess...
[16:00:34] <gagi> cause maybe I need some additional ones..
[16:00:37] <robertmaxrees> so you want to 2-step it.
[16:00:48] <robertmaxrees> go through all categories and see if any children match your criteria.
[16:00:58] <robertmaxrees> that'll take care of your first question.
[16:01:40] <gagi> sure , and how do I have the first "father" of this current link selected?
[16:01:45] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[16:01:52] <gagi> ok
[16:01:56] <robertmaxrees> you're overthinking it :)
[16:02:00] <gagi> :)
[16:02:07] <robertmaxrees> you want to go through all parent categories.
[16:02:09] <robertmaxrees> start with that.
[16:02:11] <taplar> l8r all
[16:02:53] <gagi> actually , I wanted go through all the sub categories and traverse up..
[16:03:21] <gagi> But we can do it ether way...
[16:03:41] <robertmaxrees> it'd make it easier if you gave a class to the ULs directly under .nav
[16:03:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm giving you the way to do it that fits your current html.
[16:04:06] <gagi> ok.
[16:04:56] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec let me fix your html.
[16:05:03] <gagi> lets call them cats
[16:05:09] <robertmaxrees> that's confusing.
[16:05:16] <robertmaxrees> call them categoryGroups
[16:05:19] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec
[16:05:20] <sportman> robertmaxrees would it be fine if i sent you that quick fiddle?
[16:05:28] <robertmaxrees> sportman post it in the channel.
[16:05:31] <robertmaxrees> that way anybody can help.
[16:05:39] <sportman> makes sense :)
[16:05:43] <robertmaxrees> gagi https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zjary7u9/4/
[16:05:45] <sportman> https://jsfiddle.net/agLb4hfw/10/
[16:05:47] <robertmaxrees> better indentation.
[16:05:50] <gagi> sure.
[16:06:10] <robertmaxrees> oh wait the category is what we care about - you can just .closest('.category')
[16:06:20] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i didn't understand the markup earlier.
[16:06:29] <sportman> essentially you can see the problem if you type into the fields, click save once, type something else and click save again then click undo it keeps reverting back to the first save
[16:07:09] <gagi> That's what I tried to do but it selected all the categories, instead of only one.
[16:07:21] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[16:07:57] <robertmaxrees> sportman yeah, you don't want to do it this way.
[16:09:00] <sportman> is there a way this could be done without trying to do something specific for each input?
[16:09:10] <sportman> the real use case has about 20 different forms that would want the undo feature
[16:09:28] <robertmaxrees> sportman then you need to look into something a little more substantial.
[16:09:43] <sportman> with all diff types of inputs and fields for each form
[16:09:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to save the form's HTML - you need state management.
[16:10:04] <sportman> makes sense robertmaxrees
[16:10:13] <robertmaxrees> and you want to push every "save" into an array.
[16:10:28] <robertmaxrees> if you had, say, backbone, you could create a view for each form.
[16:11:17] <gagi> https://jsfiddle.net/zjary7u9/5/
[16:11:20] <sportman> so each save actually updates the db through ajax
[16:11:48] <robertmaxrees> you also save that history client-side so you can step back as much as you want.
[16:12:08] <robertmaxrees> gagi because $(this).closest() will ALWAYS be truthy.
[16:12:13] <robertmaxrees> you're not actually testing anything there.
[16:12:29] <robertmaxrees> also, use curly braces.
[16:13:06] <sportman> ill do some reasearch on statemangement with backbone then i suppose
[16:13:11] <gagi> so, how do I test it in js/jquery? right, right, curly braces..
[16:13:19] <robertmaxrees> gagi what are you testing?
[16:13:28] <gagi> if it exsits.
[16:14:01] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you want in this case :)
[16:14:12] <gagi> why not?
[16:14:21] <robertmaxrees> just selec tthe right thing instead.
[16:14:29] <robertmaxrees> *select
[16:15:01] <gagi> how would you go for it?
[16:15:47] <robertmaxrees> did you want the active class on the <a> tags or the <li> tags?
[16:16:57] <gagi> the a tags, because the way I see it's ether from the current link up or from the # link down to every link.
[16:17:09] <gagi> it***
[16:18:49] <gagi> the matching that is...
[16:19:00] <robertmaxrees> your matching is a little unusual, but ok.
[16:20:00] <robertmaxrees> I'd enumerate through all .subcat instead
[16:20:03] <gagi> that's because I am defently doing it wrong... :)
[16:20:27] <robertmaxrees> and go from there.
[16:21:21] <gagi> ok , and than you will check if you have a parent "a[href=#]" right? and select it ?right?
[16:21:32] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the checkl.
[16:21:43] <robertmaxrees> you just get the .closest('.category')
[16:22:05] <robertmaxrees> and find the anchor from there.
[16:22:21] <robertmaxrees> the <a> itself isn't a parent of the subcategories.
[16:22:33] <gagi> but how do you know that it there will be only one?
[16:23:05] <robertmaxrees> .closest() only gets the first element that matches starting at the current element and goes up the tree.
[16:23:11] <gagi> and I also need to know that it even exists...
[16:23:15] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:23:18] <robertmaxrees> you're being really vague.
[16:23:58] <robertmaxrees> like, this is really easy.  https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zjary7u9/6/
[16:24:20] <gagi> I know, I am sorry for that, that's because of the second part of my question...
[16:24:33] <robertmaxrees> look at the fiddle.
[16:24:34] <robertmaxrees> see?
[16:30:06] <robertmaxrees> gagi see what i've been trying to say now?
[16:30:06] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:31:45] <gagi> wow , kind of close but still not I am aiming for, : I am aiming for this https://jsfiddle.net/zjary7u9/7/
[16:31:57] <robertmaxrees> so you just wanted the parent?
[16:32:03] <gagi> yeah
[16:32:06] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[16:32:13] <gagi> lol
[16:32:15] <robertmaxrees> what do you need the child for then?
[16:32:47] <gagi> to know which parent to select.
[16:32:50] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:32:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:32:55] <robertmaxrees> then there's a much easier way to do this.
[16:33:15] <gagi> ok, I am listening...
[16:35:45] <robertmaxrees> you can just filter categories that match your criteria.
[16:36:21] <gagi> which one there all "#"
[16:36:26] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:36:28] <robertmaxrees> stop with #
[16:36:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:36:33] <robertmaxrees> you really don't need it.
[16:36:45] <gagi> ok, :)
[16:39:09] <robertmaxrees> just use .filter()
[16:39:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zjary7u9/10/
[16:42:39] <gagi> ok thanks, I think it will do...
[16:42:47] <robertmaxrees> do you understand the idea there?
[16:43:22] <gagi> not really , but it looks like its' working...
[16:43:28] <robertmaxrees> then don't use it.
[16:43:37] <gagi> why not?
[16:43:43] <robertmaxrees> it's an assignment - you should know how it works.
[16:44:43] <gagi> filter() is a new thing for me I should read the api to see what's does...
[16:44:53] <gagi> never seen/used it before...
[16:44:54] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[16:45:00] <robertmaxrees> pretty quick thing to do :)
[16:45:17] <gagi> thanks, that was lightning fast...
[16:45:28] <robertmaxrees> quick google search.
[16:45:41] <gagi> Sure you are not a bot ? :)
[16:46:03] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+filter literally all it takes half the time.
[16:48:43] <gagi> yeah , thank you so muck robert  you were a great help and a great companian, I guess I am not thinking straight because It's almost midnight and I have to go bed and finish the assignment tomorow i'll read what the api says about it and go to bed.
[16:48:55] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:48:57] <robertmaxrees> heh, 'k
[16:49:09] <gagi> thanks again man, your the best(Y)
[16:57:41] <superlinux> hi. I have a complaint at jquery itself.. it makes my laptop overheat for no reason. I wish people stop using it!!!
[16:57:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:57:52] <robertmaxrees> that's... not jquery's fault.
[16:58:52] <superlinux> to me .. it's the root , I wish it can be irradiated!
[16:59:16] <robertmaxrees> Sorry to hear you feel that way.  you can feel free to file a bug, but this really isn't the right place to talk about that.
[17:02:18] <wa5ted> https://rjuaqjwrtn.localtunnel.me
[17:02:40] <arc_> lol wtf
[17:02:48] <wa5ted> im having some trouble with something, if you scroll down and notice the square grids, i cannot figure out for some reason why the boxes have a little bit of yellow sticking out
[17:03:01] <robertmaxrees> is that a jquery question?
[17:03:11] <wa5ted> ##css right?
[17:03:13] <robertmaxrees> looks like a css issue.
[17:03:17] <DrRush> can someone help me figure why a plugin isn't working
[17:03:30] <robertmaxrees> DrRush sure - just ask and we'll help if we can.
[17:03:32] <claytonzaugg> Quick question, what was the best way to populate an array during an intteration?
[17:03:37] <DrRush> plug-in http://builtbywill.com/code/booklet/
[17:03:50] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg you don't - use another method instead.
[17:03:52] <claytonzaugg> *itteration
[17:03:53] <DrRush> test case: http://pastebin.com/usEbKEzY
[17:03:54] <robertmaxrees> like .map)_
[17:03:56] <robertmaxrees> *.map()
[17:04:03] <claytonzaugg> Okay cool, thanks robertmaxrees
[17:04:45] <robertmaxrees> DrRush what's your question?
[17:04:54] <DrRush> http://prntscr.com/9gzgol what I'm getting
[17:05:18] <robertmaxrees> DrRush use jsfiddle and make it instead.
[17:06:42] <DrRush> I would but I have no idea how to import external files to it
[17:06:53] <robertmaxrees> there's an "extrernal resources" tab on the left.
[17:11:25] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need anything but the plugin though.
[17:26:30] <DrRush> robertmaxrees: there is no CDN for the plugin I am using
[17:29:10] <DrRush> so I can't load into jquery
[17:30:45] <robertmaxrees> is there a github repo for it?
[17:32:36] <DrRush> yes
[17:32:45] <robertmaxrees> you can use that with rawgit to link it.
[17:32:53] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that the stuff you gave us earlier isn't really helpful.
[17:33:22] <DrRush> rawgit?
[17:33:33] <robertmaxrees> https://rawgit.com/
[17:44:03] <Fall> Morning all. Is there anyway I can check for a specific data part on an element?
[17:44:10] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[17:44:57] <Fall> $.hasData('.element') && $('.element').data('something').length
[17:45:06] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:45:11] * Fall sighs
[17:45:15] <robertmaxrees> just do if $('.element').data('something');
[17:45:22] <Fall> ok, thanks
[17:45:24] <robertmaxrees> * if ($('.element').data('something')) {};
[17:45:53] <Fall> Thanks, I'll try that.
[17:46:02] <robertmaxrees> get the idea?
[17:46:16] <Fall> Yup, totally get it. Thanks.
[18:02:47] <DrRush> robertmaxrees: okay there we go
[18:02:50] <DrRush> https://jsfiddle.net/6u1e7jv1/2/
[18:03:04] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:03:07] <robertmaxrees> you don't need all of that.
[18:03:13] <robertmaxrees> also; consoel errors.
[18:03:45] <robertmaxrees> you need to use rawgit for https://github.com/builtbywill/Booklet/blob/master/booklet/jquery.booklet.latest.js
[18:04:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6u1e7jv1/3/

[19:27:49] <cmrabet> hi all
[19:28:09] <cmrabet> i'm trying to use .toggleClass but is not working for me.
[19:28:39] <cmrabet> This line doesn't replace the class that the DIV has (expanded): $('#dashboard-panel').toggleClass('collapsed');
[19:28:46] <cmrabet> any one knows what it could be?
[19:28:56] <robertmaxrees> should work.
[19:29:00] <robertmaxrees> sure your selector is right?
[19:29:17] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: yes, because when I replace toggleClass with addClass I can see the class being added
[19:29:24] <cmrabet> I'm using Chrome
[19:29:38] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[19:29:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[19:30:08] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming?
[19:30:32] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/0v1mu791/
[19:30:52] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming?
[19:31:16] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: with the Chrome inspector
[19:31:32] <robertmaxrees> use css instead.
[19:31:35] <robertmaxrees> with a dummy class.
[19:31:39] <cmrabet> When I click on the element that triggers the toggleClass, I can see the class attribute highlighting but it doesn't change
[19:32:50] <robertmaxrees> wonder if you're having weird bubbling issues.
[19:33:03] <robertmaxrees> put a console.log() and see how many times it fires.
[19:33:33] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0v1mu791/1/
[19:35:16] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: ok
[19:35:35] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: I've updated my fiddle
[19:35:45] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: and still doesn't work there
[19:35:46] <robertmaxrees> hit update and send the new link,.
[19:37:22] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/0v1mu791/5/
[19:37:37] <robertmaxrees> open your console ;)
[19:37:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0v1mu791/6/
[19:38:41] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: shit, it works there
[19:38:52] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: let me see the console
[19:39:48] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: it toggles twice each click?
[19:40:12] <robertmaxrees> are you binding twice?
[19:40:24] <robertmaxrees> perhaps there's some bubbling killing you?
[19:40:45] <cmrabet> that's all the javascript I have for now, I'm doing an on('click'..
[19:41:03] <robertmaxrees> if i can't see it broken, i can't really help ;)
[19:41:21] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: I'm using Bootstrap and using a <button>..
[19:41:34] <robertmaxrees> then replicate that in the fiddle.
[19:41:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46spy0a1/
[19:41:58] <robertmaxrees> here, a fresh one with jquery and bootstrap included.
[19:43:19] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: still works, https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46spy0a1/
[19:43:29] <cmrabet> wth is going on...
[19:43:33] <robertmaxrees> you need to hit update first and send me a link to it.

[19:44:13] <robertmaxrees> what about on your site?  any console errors?
[19:44:16] <robertmaxrees> can you share the page source?
[19:44:54] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: I have no errors, and this is a local script I'm working on, I've just started, there is no much
[19:45:12] <robertmaxrees> how else to you expect me to help then?>
[19:45:15] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:45:25] <robertmaxrees> use bpaste or something.
[19:45:32] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[19:45:47] <robertmaxrees> your js isn't like in the head not in a doc ready or anything like that, right?
[19:45:56] <robertmaxrees> either way - just share the page source.
[19:46:07] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: my javascript is at the bottom of the page
[19:46:53] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: found the issue, I'm including the script twice.. for some reason
[19:47:03] <robertmaxrees> so you ARE running the code twice :)
[19:47:20] <robertmaxrees> awesome - simple fix :D
[19:48:48] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: I'm using jekyll.. so I have the page split into many sub-templates.. I called the script from the main one, and then.. forgot and called the script from the sub template where the code is .. my mistake :), man I was going crazy here
[19:48:59] <robertmaxrees> eep.
[19:49:17] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: thanks for your help
[19:49:23] <robertmaxrees> def.
[19:49:30] <cmrabet> I need a punch in the face
[19:49:36] <lindii_> fender, jackson or ibanez?
[19:49:44] <lindii_> ups wrong room
[19:49:44] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ fender.
[19:49:46] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:50:24] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: definitely haha
[20:16:36] <lindii_> can i do something like $("form").find("button").remove("i").removeAttr("disabled"); ?
[20:18:03] <shoky> lindii_ no that doesn't make sense.  the .remove("i") especially
[20:19:26] <lindii_> shoky: well thats what im dealing with
[20:19:37] <shoky> what do you want it to do?
[20:20:17] <lindii_> remove the i element and the disabled attr inside the button
[20:20:25] <shoky> and btw don't do .removeAttr("disabled")  you should do  .prop("disabled", false)  for that
[20:20:43] <shoky> the disabled attr is on what element?
[20:21:13] <lindii_> sorry the disabled attr button
[20:21:39] <shoky> var buttons = $("form").find("button");   buttons.find("i").remove();   buttons.prop("disabled", false);
[20:23:25] <lindii_> shoky: should i also use prop in a case like $("form").find("button").prepend("<i class='fa fa-spinner fa-spin'></i> ").attr("disabled");
[20:23:57] <shoky> lindii_:  .attr("disabled")  doesn't do anything..?
[20:24:13] <shoky> you should use prop yeah if you want to read the value
[20:24:39] <lindii_> shoky: yes but whats the diff between prop and attr?
[20:24:43] <shoky> but don't chain things like that
[20:24:45] <vincere> can someone help explain to me how to get .hover to call a function?
[20:24:46] <shoky> even if it works
[20:24:52] <shoky> it just makes your code less readable
[20:24:56] <vincere> i am trying to do this
[20:24:57] <vincere>         desktop_nav.find('li').hover(move_psuedo_under( this ), move_psuedo_under('ul.nav.navbar-nav .active'));
[20:24:57] <shoky> and hence it makes your code worse
[20:25:13] <lindii_> shoky: thanks for the advice
[20:25:16] <vincere> but it calls the function when it loads, rather then when it is hovered
[20:26:28] <shoky> lindii_:  one gets the property and one gets the attribute ;)  it's kinda complicated the real detailes of the diffrences between them,  and how browsers can make it confusing.  but in general, properties are the run-time values you should work with at run-time. and attributes are the stuff you put in your initial html on the html tags
[20:27:27] <shoky> lindii_: since you want to know the run time value here (you want to know the run time state of the button - is it disabled or not), then using the property is the right one here.  but sometimes using the attribute instead can still work - because browsers sync them sometimes making it confusing )
[20:28:35] <shoky> vincere: .hover(function() {  fn1(this);  fn2('whatever');  });
[20:28:42] <lindii_> i should read a bit more about that
[20:28:48] <lindii_> thanks shoky
[20:29:06] <shoky> np
[20:36:12] <vincere> shoky: shoudn't it be to seperate function() bits with a comma inbetween?
[20:36:25] <vincere> as i am trying to call the mouseenter, and mouse leave
[20:37:57] <shoky> vincere: oh i forgot bout that way to call it.  .hover(fn, function() { fn('whatever'); })
[20:38:20] <shoky> vincere:  or  .hover(function() {  fn(whatever)  }, function() { fn(whutever) })
[20:38:47] <vincere> shoky: yeah cool, that makes sense
[21:01:54] <vincere> hmm
[21:02:58] <vincere> i tell jquery to give an element a left:300px, and then tell it to put on a transition:all 2s; but the the original left:300px is still animated
[21:05:54] <shoky> add the transition in a setTimeout(fn, 0)   i guess
[21:06:00] <shoky> why are you doing that ?
[21:06:43] <shoky> nevermind, goodnight;p
[21:09:28] <vincere> it worked
[23:34:04] <jknfvvs> where can i get cheatsheet of jquery ?
