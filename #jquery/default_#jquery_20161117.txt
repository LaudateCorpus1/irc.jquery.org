[00:03:07] <Moses777> I can't manage to select a specific element. what am i doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/179xefsm/5/ tried with parents() too. I want to find this parents child element
[00:05:03] <Moses777> oh sorry i misspelled it runs now
[01:06:50] <Chulbul> $(document).on("pjax:end", function() { ... }); I need to stop it on one pjax container, that is #pjax-container-alert-message, so I'm trying to change the code like $(document).not('#pjax-container-alert-message').on(...), but it's not working. Any suggestions please.
[01:25:53] <ISmithers> How do I detect when an <asp:Hidden> field's Value changes in jQuery?

[01:45:27] <nopacienc3> hi
[01:45:48] <nopacienc3> is this a feature or bug ? https://jsfiddle.net/9vkmhaLt/
[01:47:48] <systemfault> Why the hell do you use .html?
[01:56:49] <nopacienc3> systemfault: talking with me ?
[01:57:32] <systemfault> Yes.
[01:57:36] <systemfault> .html is for HTML
[01:57:50] <nopacienc3> and ?
[01:57:59] <systemfault> You're not giving it HTML
[01:58:33] <systemfault> You're misusing a function then you wonder why it acts strangely.
[01:58:57] <nopacienc3> i want it to console.log after the input is re-appended into the page.
[01:59:38] <systemfault> .html exists to transform HTML (string) to a fragment (Nodes)
[01:59:49] <nopacienc3> i want it to respect the events i set earlier on my_input element. after i remove it from the page
[01:59:50] <Uhkis> nopacienc3: you're doing it wrong.
[01:59:52] <nopacienc3> hmm
[01:59:54] <systemfault> So, if you want to remove an element, use .remove or .detach
[01:59:55] <nopacienc3> then i should do .append
[01:59:59] <systemfault> nopacienc3: Yes.
[02:00:06] <nopacienc3> right
[02:00:07] <systemfault> .append is for appending either HTML or nodes
[02:01:27] <nopacienc3> https://jsfiddle.net/9vkmhaLt/1/
[02:01:29] <nopacienc3> like this ?
[02:01:34] <nopacienc3> still dont work
[02:02:26] <Uhkis> nopacienc3: you need to make a delegated event listener, not recreating it every time
[02:02:44] <systemfault> nopacienc3: Come on...
[02:02:53] <systemfault> read the difference between .remove() and .detach()
[02:02:56] <systemfault> please.
[02:03:21] <systemfault> You could use a delegated event listener but that's not "required"
[02:03:56] <nopacienc3> ok
[02:05:19] <nopacienc3> bah..
[02:05:39] <nopacienc3> should have used detach before
[02:06:24] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/9vkmhaLt/4/ see how it works fine with delegation
[02:08:27] <nopacienc3> deletaged would be nice too, i will check its supported on this jquery version (bit older)
[02:08:33] <nopacienc3> 1.5 i think
[02:08:58] <nopacienc3> thanks so much Uhkis, systemfault
[03:48:52] <TotallyNotKim> hey im using https://github.com/peachananr/interactive_3d to compose multiple images into a 3d object, which wokrs fine on desktops, but kinda laggy on tablets. I thought it might be better to convert all pictures into a webm (say 1frame/s), set it to loop and control the rotation using forward/rewind mapped to the drag and drop events
[03:48:57] <TotallyNotKim> What do you think?
[03:49:30] <TotallyNotKim> site in question is http://www.gsd-software.net/index.php?id=43
[03:49:35] <TotallyNotKim> on the bottom
[04:26:05] <mechanist> hello
[04:28:16] <mechanist> http://pastebin.com/4mKiX7Yu why the spinner isn't disappearing when the file is uploaded? $("#spinner").hide(); http://pastebin.com/4mKiX7Yu
[04:30:19] <TotallyNotKim> open developer tools of browser and try setting a breakpoint in the event, check if its even fired
[05:00:15] <mar77i> hmm.
[05:00:38] <mar77i> so I'm writing a display layer here, and it's kind of strange
[05:01:10] <mar77i> I'm loading images and inside the .ready() callback, I get image.width() and image.height() == 0
[05:01:51] <mar77i> I thought this would be better if I added the element before the ready, but that seems not to help
[05:02:21] <mechanist> TotallyNotKim: the function call $("#spinner").hide(); doesn't appear on the debugger at all
[05:02:34] <mechanist> but it's in the pag
[05:02:35] <mechanist> pag
[05:02:37] <mechanist> page
[05:03:07] <TotallyNotKim> I would say you hvae cache problems then
[05:03:12] <TotallyNotKim> try a hard reload
[05:03:18] <TotallyNotKim> CTRG-Shift-R
[05:03:21] <TotallyNotKim> in chrome atleast
[05:03:41] <TotallyNotKim> otherwise every browser should allow you to clear the cache in settings somewhere
[05:03:58] <TotallyNotKim> you could give me a link too, if you like
[05:06:44] <mechanist> you was right
[05:07:01] <mechanist> ctrl+shift+R and now it appears
[05:08:47] <TotallyNotKim> ^_^
[05:10:40] <mechanist> TotallyNotKim: now the text "success" doesn't appear
[05:10:59] <mechanist> I have this:
[05:11:10] <mechanist> complete: function(xhr) { status.html(xhr.responseText); $("#spinner").hide(); }
[05:11:46] <mechanist> can I declare the function two times? --> function(xhr) { status.html(xhr.responseText);} and function(xhr) {$("#spinner").hide(); }
[05:12:09] <TotallyNotKim> no
[05:12:19] <TotallyNotKim> its correct the way you're doing it now
[05:12:22] <Cork> mechanist: use the deferred syntax and you can
[05:12:22] <mechanist> I ask it because it could be because it could hide the text object too status.html(xhr.responseText);
[05:12:23] <TotallyNotKim> im looking for the error
[05:12:38] <Cork> $.ajax().always().always()
[05:12:54] <TotallyNotKim> Cork: http://pastebin.com/4mKiX7Yu htats what he has
[05:12:58] <TotallyNotKim> thats*
[05:13:00] <mechanist> here's the link: http://thief.massimilianogoi.com/upload.html
[05:13:58] <Cork> cleaned up https://jsfiddle.net/axzm6erw/
[05:14:32] <Cork> what is the problem exactly?
[05:14:36] <TotallyNotKim> #status {
[05:14:36] <TotallyNotKim>     color: #ffffff;
[05:14:36] <TotallyNotKim> }
[05:14:40] <TotallyNotKim> thats the problem
[05:14:48] <TotallyNotKim> white on white isnt exactly visible
[05:15:32] <Cork> also $(function() {}) is the same as $(document).ready(function() {  })
[05:15:36] <Cork> so no need to have both
[05:15:45] <mar77i> oh I tried .load instead of .ready and it worked \o/
[05:15:46] <TotallyNotKim>  thanks for the fiddle btw
[05:16:01] <mechanist> cork: it's identical
[05:16:08] <Cork> mechanist: yes
[05:16:12] <mar77i> images seem to be special unicorns when it comes to .load() vs .ready()
[05:16:20] <mechanist> dangit
[05:16:23] <TotallyNotKim> mechanist: redundant tho
[05:16:27] <mechanist> [11:14] <TotallyNotKim>     color: #ffffff;
[05:16:31] <Cork> mar77i: more like .ready is special
[05:16:33] <TotallyNotKim> you only need one of them
[05:16:41] <mar77i> Cork: care elaborate?
[05:16:49] <mechanist> if this is true I'm a real dumb
[05:16:50] <mar77i> Cork: I'm lost :)
[05:16:51] <Cork> .load is a default dom event, while .ready is a jquery special callback
[05:16:54] <Cork> it isn't even an event
[05:16:59] <TotallyNotKim> mechanist: it is true, trust me :P
[05:17:01] <mar77i> ah.
[05:17:04] <mechanist> ok I am
[05:17:05] <mechanist> lol
[05:17:17] <mar77i> yeah. that makes some sense.
[05:17:44] <Cork> and $(document).ready is deprecated in jquery 3.1 so i recommend using $(function() {})
[05:18:32] <TotallyNotKim> mechanist: https://jsfiddle.net/axzm6erw/1/ this should be working too
[05:18:39] <TotallyNotKim> threw out some of the redundant stuff
[05:19:29] <TotallyNotKim> also make sure that there is no way to get user data into xhr.responseText, otherwise XSS could happen
[05:20:00] <TotallyNotKim> you might want to use .text() if you only send strings back
[05:24:18] <mechanist> cool
[05:24:23] <mechanist> thank you guys
[05:25:01] <mechanist> what a xss is? I'm a really dummy in javascript/jquery
[05:25:53] <mechanist> Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all
[05:25:53] <mechanist> security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007.[1] Their effect may range from a petty nuisance to a significant security risk, depending on the

[05:26:12] <Cork> and don't dump the text into the channel >_<
[05:26:27] <mechanist> unbelieveble... and i had no knowledge about it
[05:26:57] <Cork> the solution is fairly simple, NEVER trust user input
[05:27:13] <mechanist> that's what I'm asking but, you know, this is just a test
[05:27:31] <mechanist> when the function will be ended everything will be allright

[05:31:18] <TotallyNotKim> oh I'm banned :(
[05:31:48] <mechanist> haha
[05:31:56] <mechanist> going to see your datas
[05:32:09] <TotallyNotKim> have fun fidling with my firewall
[05:32:19] <TotallyNotKim> fighting*

[05:32:31] <mechanist> Munich, Germany Linux Chrome 54.0.2840.100 1680x1050
[05:32:32] <TotallyNotKim> :)
[05:32:45] <TotallyNotKim> no in munich actually
[05:32:56] <TotallyNotKim> ip based location is very inaccurate
[05:33:01] <mechanist> I know...
[05:33:35] <mechanist> that's why we were on the same frequency... you're german
[05:33:44] <TotallyNotKim> right
[05:34:04] <TotallyNotKim> doubt it has to do with any nationality but who knows :P
[05:35:13] <mechanist> my wife is german too
[05:35:27] <TotallyNotKim> also I don't think you can translate "Auf einer Wellenlaenge" to "on the same frequency." tho
[05:35:29] <TotallyNotKim> haha
[05:35:46] * TotallyNotKim nips his beer
[05:35:50] <mechanist> I don't understand german though
[05:35:52] <mechanist> XD
[05:36:07] <TotallyNotKim> jk it's just 11:30
[05:37:11] <mechanist> https://translate.google.it/#de/en/Auf%20einer%20Wellenlaenge
[05:37:14] <mechanist> same meaning
[05:39:50] <TotallyNotKim> is there a way to see uploaded files?
[05:39:56] <mechanist> yeah
[05:40:04] <mechanist> through ftp at the moment
[05:40:14] <TotallyNotKim> oh wow haha
[05:41:00] <mechanist> after i've finished with javascripts I'll pass to the same old php/mysql pattern
[05:41:22] <TotallyNotKim> i thought I could play with it and execute funny db commands
[05:41:39] <mechanist> nope
[05:41:46] <mechanist> no database is linked
[05:41:58] <TotallyNotKim> get rid of php tho :P
[05:42:01] <TotallyNotKim> php is ouuuuut
[05:42:02] <mechanist> but you could try with the login form
[05:42:11] <slax0r> since when is php out?
[05:42:16] <slax0r> what would you use instead of php then?
[05:42:20] <mechanist> i'm asked to learn it
[05:42:32] <TotallyNotKim> im soooorry
[05:42:35] <mechanist> there is rubyrails now
[05:42:37] <TotallyNotKim> it's out for _me_
[05:42:50] <TotallyNotKim> im using rest only websites
[05:42:55] <slax0r> there's nothing wrong with php, if you learn it properly and use it properly...
[05:43:02] <mechanist> that'strue
[05:43:09] <TotallyNotKim> backend rest api running c#
[05:43:18] * TotallyNotKim vanishes 
[05:43:33] <slax0r> still better than rest api running with c++
[05:43:34] <mechanist> c# isn't for microsoft servers?
[05:43:56] <TotallyNotKim> running on mono with hyperfastcgi and nginx
[05:44:02] <TotallyNotKim> fast as hell
[05:44:05] <slax0r> there are libraries that allow you to run it on non m$ servers
[05:44:20] <mechanist> can't believe it
[05:44:26] <slax0r> but that's like...strapping rubber weels on a tank just so you can drive it on the road
[05:44:35] <mechanist> too bad I don't own the server...
[05:44:37] <TotallyNotKim> also mickysoft is slowly turning to linux
[05:44:58] <TotallyNotKim> slowly, but it's happening
[05:45:27] <mechanist> yes, I did notice the changing, from 8 to furthers
[05:45:51] <slax0r> a change for the better I'd say, but still terrible
[05:45:58] <TotallyNotKim> true
[05:46:24] <slax0r> if I wasn't a nerd, I'd probably never use it
[05:46:25] <mechanist> I don't mind, my computer is really fast and modern games runs smoothly
[05:46:39] <TotallyNotKim> aint booting windows other thanfor  gaming and photoshop / after effects
[05:46:40] <mechanist> I could only be tempted if the binaries would run faster than in windows
[05:46:43] <TotallyNotKim> or adobe in general
[05:47:18] <TotallyNotKim> also VisualStudio
[05:47:25] <TotallyNotKim> but that's a thing that they did right
[05:47:25] <slax0r> god no
[05:47:30] <TotallyNotKim> god yes
[05:47:36] <TotallyNotKim> ;D
[05:47:48] <slax0r> haven't used an IDE in like 10 years
[05:47:52] <mechanist> I'm tempted to linux also because in win 10 there's a spy application inside
[05:47:55] <mechanist> that sucks
[05:48:21] <slax0r> cute, you think earlier versions didn't spy on you
[05:48:29] <mechanist> lol
[05:48:37] <TotallyNotKim> slax0r: depends on what comfort level you on I would say
[05:48:43] <TotallyNotKim> and what you're programming in general
[05:48:45] <mechanist> at least it wasn't official :D
[05:49:01] <TotallyNotKim> python etc go straight into a text editor
[05:49:16] <slax0r> TotallyNotKim: oh lots of different languages
[05:49:26] <slax0r> once you get used to a specific tool it's hard to switch away from it
[05:49:37] <TotallyNotKim> thats with me and vs
[05:49:47] <TotallyNotKim> what i can do in there, im doing in there
[05:49:51] <mechanist> I only use text editors
[05:49:58] <slax0r> let's just say, if I try to use a conventional editor/ide my file gets filled with 'hjkl' and other random chars
[05:50:11] <TotallyNotKim> haha
[05:50:19] <TotallyNotKim> needs more brainfuck I would say
[05:50:20] <mechanist> I did try Dreamweaver but it's not for me, too difficult
[05:50:27] <TotallyNotKim> ewww
[05:50:30] <TotallyNotKim> go
[05:50:31] <TotallyNotKim> away
[05:51:20] <slax0r> I guess it all depends on how you define "comfort level"
[05:51:35] <slax0r> I personally hate when I have to move my hands of the keyboard
[05:51:48] <slax0r> and have no problem of using regex while searching in or for files
[05:51:56] <slax0r> problem with*
[05:52:04] <TotallyNotKim> using i3 too, huh? :P
[05:52:14] <slax0r> aye
[05:52:15] <TotallyNotKim> Screw window managers
[05:52:49] <slax0r> I am either obvious or you found my config on github :P
[05:53:14] <TotallyNotKim> oh let me check that
[05:53:22] <TotallyNotKim> i actually did get something from github
[05:55:43] <mechanist> I've always used drag&drop and dialogs, but Dreamweaver is really non-user friendly
[05:57:16] <TotallyNotKim> not your config
[05:57:19] <TotallyNotKim> ah
[05:57:25] <TotallyNotKim> using macbooks too
[05:57:35] <TotallyNotKim> nice starter website tho
[05:57:45] <TotallyNotKim> looks decent
[05:58:43] <mechanist> $( "p" ).text( 'success' );
[05:58:46] <mechanist> not correct
[05:59:25] <TotallyNotKim> that would replace every single p text with success
[05:59:28] <mechanist> 11:57] <TotallyNotKim> nice starter website tho
[05:59:28] <mechanist> [11:57] <TotallyNotKim> looks decent
[05:59:43] <mechanist> I've spent something  like two months before buying it
[05:59:52] <earational> hey
[05:59:53] <mechanist> doing investigations
[06:00:16] <TotallyNotKim> were reffering to slax0r 's github but... okay I guess? haha
[06:00:22] <mechanist> lol
[06:00:44] <mechanist> why $( "p" ).text( 'success' ); isn't working?
[06:01:00] <slax0r> wait
[06:01:01] <slax0r> wut?
[06:01:07] <slax0r> I fell out of the loop here
[06:01:07] <slax0r> :D
[06:01:35] <TotallyNotKim> https://github.com/slax0r
[06:01:38] <TotallyNotKim> not you?
[06:01:50] <TotallyNotKim> I thought the name was pretty unique soo.. haha
[06:02:07] <slax0r> no, that's not me
[06:02:11] <slax0r> https://github.com/slax0rr
[06:02:12] <slax0r> that's me :P
[06:02:42] <TotallyNotKim> ah the classical "If name is taking repeat last character -> repeat" tactic
[06:02:50] <TotallyNotKim> taken*
[06:03:10] <TotallyNotKim> using nagios
[06:03:11] <TotallyNotKim> awesome
[06:03:16] <TotallyNotKim> would change to icinga tho
[06:03:28] <TotallyNotKim> it's getting a bit old
[06:03:45] <slax0r> ...
[06:03:46] <slax0r> how?
[06:03:48] <slax0r> where?
[06:03:55] <slax0r> do you like...know me?
[06:04:13] <slax0r> I was setting up nagios/icinga in the previous workplace
[06:04:18] <TotallyNotKim> hehe
[06:04:22] <slax0r> and yes, repeat :P
[06:06:39] <TotallyNotKim> check this out: https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt
[06:06:51] <TotallyNotKim> maybe you like it too
[06:07:07] <TotallyNotKim> thought I was in heaven after I installed it
[06:08:53] <TotallyNotKim> mechanist: in case you didn't figured it out yet, $('p') isn't working because you're not using a single p element in the site
[06:09:18] <TotallyNotKim> just use $('#status').text()
[06:27:04] <Duikb00t> o/
[06:27:14] <TotallyNotKim> o7
[06:27:23] <Duikb00t> So far I made this: https://jsfiddle.net/zqeztzgL/3/  as ( demo )
[06:27:33] <Duikb00t> Is there a way I can 'repeat' all elements inside my container easily?
[06:27:50] <Duikb00t> I would like to 'infinite' scroll the elements available.
[06:27:58] <Duikb00t> I can clone but that's ust once
[06:28:23] <TotallyNotKim> mhmm
[06:28:31] <TotallyNotKim> background-repeat hit my head
[06:28:45] <TotallyNotKim> not sure how we could use it for that yet
[06:28:49] <Duikb00t> but that's just for an image.. I would like to repeat the dom elements.
[06:29:11] <TotallyNotKim> oh it doesn't actually have to be an image
[06:29:13] <TotallyNotKim> okay
[06:29:13] <Duikb00t> I would like to create something similar like this: demo.stylishthemes.co/diva/#
[06:29:22] <Duikb00t> http://demo.stylishthemes.co/diva/#
[06:29:37] <FilipNortic_> there is clone
[06:30:15] <Duikb00t> Like I mentioned isn't clone just being for 1 time?
[06:30:22] <Duikb00t> Can I clone oo times?
[06:30:48] <FilipNortic_> why would you need to just save a copy and add on the fly
[06:31:21] <TotallyNotKim> ^this
[06:32:22] <Duikb00t> Im just unsure about how to load the first image again after the lastest one is being shown
[06:32:47] <TotallyNotKim> put the html for them in a variable
[06:32:52] <Duikb00t> yes
[06:32:57] <TotallyNotKim> and then you can do .append(images) or something
[06:34:45] <Duikb00t> to the container
[06:34:55] <Duikb00t> lik eso https://jsfiddle.net/zqeztzgL/4/
[06:36:44] <TotallyNotKim> give me a sec
[06:49:00] <TotallyNotKim> okay, dont have time to write the actual code for you atm, but i think you'll have to switch to jquery animations and tie the append to something like (container height + image height) / image height and append enough so you wont run out of pictures while scrolling
[06:49:34] <TotallyNotKim> once you're up all the way you should be aple to reset the animation and it should be visible, because you reset to the exact same position
[06:49:41] <TotallyNotKim> at least thats how i would try it
[06:50:05] <TotallyNotKim> might aswell keep the css animations tho
[07:00:15] <Duikb00t> ok
[07:00:16] <Duikb00t> thx
[07:11:45] <shai3423> Hello, I would like to split sentence by spaces into array, the problem is that split not keeping the new line char "\n", every \n become empty element inside the array, any idea how to split and keep \n?
[07:14:33] <Cork> what?
[07:15:17] <Cork> shai3423: 'a\nb c\nd e f g h'.split(' ') works just fine
[07:15:21] <Cork> the \n is kept
[07:17:10] <Cork> as proof 'a\nb c\nd e f g h'.split(' ')[0].charCodeAt(1) == 10
[07:19:33] <shai3423> Cork: when I use string.split(/\s/); (\s = whitespace) then it removed also the \n but when I use your code split(' ') its working great, but my question is why the \s also removing the new line char?
[07:19:52] <Cork> ya, cause \s is separator not space
[07:20:07] <Cork> and that includeds among other line breaks
[07:21:12] <Cork> "Equivalent to [ \f\n\r\t\v\u00a0\u1680\u180e\u2000-\u200a\u2028\u2029\u202f\u205f\u3000\ufeff]"
[07:22:01] <shai3423> Cork: you are the king :) thank you - was very helpful
[08:38:09] <TotallyNotKim> Duikb00t: like this? https://jsfiddle.net/zqeztzgL/6/
[08:38:28] <Duikb00t> oO :D haha
[08:38:28] <Duikb00t> yes
[08:38:31] <Duikb00t> insane
[08:38:37] <TotallyNotKim> code is trash I think, so you should rewrite that I suppose
[08:38:42] <Duikb00t> yes yes
[08:38:46] <Duikb00t> ill rewrite
[08:38:49] <Duikb00t> but that's exactly what I need
[08:38:53] <TotallyNotKim> but you get the idea
[08:38:57] <Duikb00t> and when I hove I want to stop it
[08:38:59] <Duikb00t> nice
[08:38:59] <Duikb00t> thanks
[08:39:13] <TotallyNotKim> just add a parameter to your recusive function
[08:39:21] <Duikb00t> okkk
[08:39:32] <TotallyNotKim> like function(stop) and then if (stop) return or something
[08:40:45] <TotallyNotKim> im here if you need something
[08:41:05] <MassDebates> Why not use raw CSS for this?
[08:41:20] <MassDebates> This is one of those times that I wonder if the usage of #jquery at all is even appropriate.
[08:43:36] <TotallyNotKim> he wants to duplicate dom elements, not necessarily images
[08:43:41] <TotallyNotKim> at lest thats what he said
[08:43:46] <TotallyNotKim> least*
[08:44:25] <MassDebates> I think this may be a case of the X Y problem
[08:44:43] <MassDebates> He may have just wanted to duplicate dom elements to repeat the animation
[08:45:20] <TotallyNotKim> he said > but that's just for an image.. I would like to repeat the dom elements.
[08:45:25] <TotallyNotKim> so I gave him what he wanted
[08:45:31] <Duikb00t> I need this effect :) demo.stylishthemes.co/diva/#
[08:45:43] <Duikb00t> http://demo.stylishthemes.co/diva/# MassDebates
[08:45:49] <Duikb00t> Btw: Yo! MassDebates
[08:46:33] <TotallyNotKim> not sure if one could accomplish this in css only
[08:47:01] <anexit> Nah
[08:47:04] <anexit> You need js
[08:47:18] <TotallyNotKim> thats what I thought
[08:47:34] <TotallyNotKim> you may get the image loop going with css
[08:47:44] <TotallyNotKim> but everything else just makes it weired
[08:48:17] <anexit> That site is using canonical
[08:49:07] <MassDebates> howdy, Duikb00t !
[08:49:22] <TotallyNotKim> also its one of this times they are using wordpress for a gallery
[08:49:35] <TotallyNotKim> don't understand this ppl
[08:49:44] <MassDebates> ?
[08:50:16] <TotallyNotKim> well they have pretty good media management to be honest
[08:50:41] <MassDebates> yeah, and maintenance is turned into a breeze.
[08:51:06] <MassDebates> And marketshare is awesome for wordpress, making it easy to get support from either other people resolving the same problem in the past, or having so many experts out ther that they're a dime a dozen
[08:51:55] <TotallyNotKim> have to agree with that
[08:51:56] <MassDebates> Sure, there's some issues with its mangling of redirects and httpd, and I guess it can be criticized for some of its deeper plugin management, but I think there's a point where the CMSs responsibility ends and the plugin developer's responsibility begins.
[08:52:17] <FilipNortic_> and u need to be careful of all the automated script that the kiddies run and kook for wp vunrabilities
[08:52:21] <anexit> http://buildinternet.com/2009/03/sliding-boxes-and-captions-with-jquery/
[08:52:38] <MassDebates> Ah, yeah, security can be an issue if not properly addressed
[08:52:46] <anexit> That would be your best bet, he calls an ajax image galery that causes it to scroll
[08:52:51] <MassDebates> but then again, I'd like to see someone secure Magento more easily than wordpress.
[08:53:01] <MassDebates> keyword: easily
[09:53:35] <lng> Hi! How do I skip the first item in set? https://jsfiddle.net/11jkpjLn/6/
[09:54:02] <lng> e.g. 0 should be kept
[09:58:18] <AdamPDotty> $('set').eq(0);
[09:58:57] <AdamPDotty> or do you mean "kept" = "not hidden"
[09:59:06] <lng> yes
[09:59:11] <lng> not hidden
[09:59:30] <AdamPDotty> $('set').not(':first'); should do
[10:00:25] <lng> awesome!
[10:00:30] <lng> thanks so much!
[10:00:35] <AdamPDotty> next!
[11:18:19] <dglambert> yo
[11:18:40] <ExoUNX> greetings
[11:18:44] <ExoUNX> and real quick
[11:19:27] <ExoUNX> I have a jQuery toggle that covers a whole div. When I click a hyperlink it works but closes the div, how can I stop it from closing if I click a link
[11:19:48] <taplar> couple ways
[11:20:03] <ExoUNX> "best" way?
[11:20:10] <taplar> either bind a click on the children that you want to ignore and stopPropagation in those handlers
[11:20:30] <taplar> or in your handler check event.target or originalTarget to see if the element that was clicked was the div
[11:26:40] <ExoUNX> taplar thanks I did stopProp....
[11:50:04] <__ddd__> anyone know of a good/modern alternative to jquery.Batch? https://github.com/mlmorg/jquery.batch
[11:50:40] <__ddd__> tldr: I'm looking to batch get requests and send them as a single post request, and let the server handle subrequests
[11:51:57] <taplar> that's...... weird
[11:52:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[11:52:13] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you don't just send a single request yourself.
[11:52:20] <taplar> the whole concept of an endpoint is it performs a unit of work
[11:53:11] <__ddd__> it's orders of magnitude faster than sending 50 get requests at once
[11:53:28] <taplar> your not understanding us
[11:53:37] <taplar> that one endpoint can know to do those 50 requets
[11:53:38] <robertmaxrees> heh - why not craft the single request yourself?
[11:53:54] <taplar> but you don't usually tell an endpoint the further requests to make
[11:54:25] <taplar> further more allowing a client to direct a server to make ajax calls is..... smelly
[11:54:52] <__ddd__> i don't think you understand...
[11:55:01] <taplar> do tell
[11:55:18] <robertmaxrees> taplar this just modifies the multiple requests into one to the server.
[11:55:29] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with having the server make other requests afaict
[11:55:39] <taplar> ah, ok i inject that part
[11:55:55] <taplar> but i still refer to the single unit of work part
[11:56:00] <__ddd__> the server makes 'subRequests' which aren't real http requests, they're just calls to other routes
[11:56:07] <robertmaxrees> __ddd__ why not build this out yourself?
[11:56:16] <__ddd__> build what out myself?
[11:56:34] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don't see why you need a plugin to build out the data for a request.
[11:57:18] <__ddd__> robertmaxrees the plugin I linked to lets you add in regular jquery $.get calls to the batch, does its magic, and sends the post request with the serialized get requests
[11:57:47] <robertmaxrees> right - i see what it does.  it'd be relatively trivial to build out something you call yourself that does very similar stuff.
[11:57:51] <taplar> so, multiple ajax requests
[11:57:51] <robertmaxrees> just without calling $.get()
[11:57:52] <__ddd__> I'm surprised this is a confusing strategy... taplar: what exactly do you direct
[11:57:59] <robertmaxrees> it's not confusing.
[11:58:00] <robertmaxrees> it's weird.
[11:58:07] <robertmaxrees> why not just build the single request yourself?
[11:58:16] <__ddd__> because I need this to happen dynamically
[11:58:18] <taplar> so that plugin does not do a single ajax call, it just does them all for you?
[11:58:28] <__ddd__> and I'm not going to build an endpoint for every permutation of requests
[11:58:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying you should.
[11:58:39] <taplar> so it's building the when().then() 's
[11:58:46] <taplar> ?
[11:58:48] <robertmaxrees> but it should be relatively trivial to accomplish exactly this without a plugin.
[11:59:24] <robertmaxrees> in fact, i'm doing basically that right now - a series of api calls for a variable number of things and then handling when those things finish.
[11:59:24] <__ddd__> taplar: the plugin does a single ajax call, that it builds from $.get calls. really handy when switching from lazy loading to background loading. way faster than using a webworker for each get request
[11:59:48] <taplar> 'that it builds from get callS'
[11:59:51] <__ddd__> do you realize how much time you waste making 50 round trips instead of one?
[11:59:57] <taplar> that makes no sense
[12:00:05] <robertmaxrees> __ddd__ heh we get you're not making 50 calls now.
[12:00:07] <__ddd__> taplar it overrides default jquery behavior
[12:00:08] <robertmaxrees> you're making 1.
[12:00:23] <robertmaxrees> which is great.  but why do you need to replce $.get to accomplish that?
[12:00:45] <_genuser_> fellow jquery users...
[12:00:55] <__ddd__> convenience for one. they are $.get calls right now
[12:00:57] <taplar> __ddd__: your saying that if I give that batch method three get calls, it will only perform one ajax call?
[12:01:21] <robertmaxrees> __ddd__ so you're gonna have a hard time doing this without modifying your original code.
[12:01:22] <__ddd__> taplar yes, it sends a POST request that has serialized GET requests in the body
[12:01:33] <taplar> i don't believe that at all
[12:01:36] <_genuser_> I have an array of strings. I want to see if x is in the array. Is there an easy/fast(performance wise) way to do if (x in array) work();   ?
[12:02:10] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ how big is the array?
[12:02:11] <__ddd__> taplar what don't you believe?
[12:02:24] <robertmaxrees> taplar that's really what that plugin does.
[12:02:35] <robertmaxrees> it takes a bunch of calls to $.get() and combines them into a single $.post()
[12:02:36] <taplar> that you can take multiple get requests, potentially going to different urls, and it would only make one ajax call to do all of them
[12:02:38] <robertmaxrees> it's... interesting.
[12:02:52] <robertmaxrees> something tells me they'd all be the same url, right?
[12:02:59] <taplar> who says?
[12:03:01] <_genuser_> indexOf() looks like it will work.
[12:03:10] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ you could also use .some()
[12:03:13] <taplar> does the plugin force that?
[12:03:19] <robertmaxrees> lots of options.  but don't worry about performance.
[12:03:20] <__ddd__> look if you guys have a better way to batch together get requests as one request, I'm all ears
[12:03:24] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: it's an array of 30'ish items for now. But I'm looking thru it for _every single_ tag added to the document.
[12:03:44] <robertmaxrees> __ddd__ i'd just create an object and ship that.
[12:03:48] <robertmaxrees> instead of overriding $.get
[12:03:52] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ woah uh
[12:03:54] <robertmaxrees> why?
[12:04:05] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: even if I console.log every single item - it bogs the browser down and increases the load time hugely. and if I iterate over an 30long array for each item, I figure it will do similarly
[12:04:22] <__ddd__> robertmaxrees: what do you mean all the same url? every get request is to a different url
[12:04:28] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ i mean - why are you iterating through the entire document like that?
[12:04:34] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: as to why: each item added, I want to see if its class exists in teh 30 long array. If so, delete it.
[12:04:57] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ so you want all items with one of 30 classes to be removed?
[12:05:02] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: yes, I can use adblock, ghostery. Now it's just a nerd fun matter to finish the extension I started writing.
[12:05:12] <robertmaxrees> there's a much easier way to do that.
[12:05:33] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: any item in the document (as it's being added), if it has a "blacklisted" class name, delete it.
[12:05:47] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: I know I could wait for document load, and then do $(".classname").remove();
[12:05:54] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[12:05:57] <_genuser_> but by then it has loaded and even shown on the page.
[12:06:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:06:11] <robertmaxrees> why not just use css to hide them instead?
[12:06:15] <_genuser_> AND, it may have embedded iframes which could start adding cookies, OR downloading other stuff.
[12:06:25] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:06:26] <__ddd__> taplar, robertmaxrees: if you know of a better way to aggregate GET requests to one request, I'd love to use it
[12:06:32] <_genuser_> if they're hidden, not removed, they're still setting cookies and possibly loading other stuff.
[12:06:38] <taplar> manually?
[12:06:41] <taplar> just do it
[12:06:43] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ i'm well aware of how that all works.
[12:06:48] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ i work in ecom ;)
[12:07:13] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: didn't mean to be know-it-all rude. Just explaining why I'm doing it that long hard way. :)
[12:07:16] <robertmaxrees> __ddd__ that's a really specific request and kind of strange.  i don't know of any plugin except for the one you showed.  i'd just refactor that that point.
[12:07:34] <__ddd__> _genuser_ why not just make an event for adding items? then remove when that event fires
[12:07:39] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ you're also circumventing revenue generation for those sites buuut something tells me you don't care.
[12:07:48] <robertmaxrees> __ddd__ he's not adding the elements himself.
[12:07:57] <robertmaxrees> he's modiying other pages using a usertscript.
[12:07:58] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:08:26] <__ddd__> robertmaxrees: it's pretty much what GraphQL does, isn't it?
[12:08:28] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: well, I do see your point on revenue generation. And I'm thinking it's better to just not visit the site altogether, if it has such low returns as a user.
[12:08:45] <arc_> it's like actually ridiculous how often people come in here trying to embed other websites in an iframe
[12:08:59] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: however, the matter of geek curiosity is altogether a separate one.
[12:09:56] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: additionally, I"d still be ok, removing facebook tracking from other sites, I visit. (does the site lose facebook provided revenue? Or does facebook lose tracking revenue? not clear, who pays who (whom?)
[12:10:52] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: intersting read on stackoverflow. I saw a post by them about this topic. they said they don't mind if people use adblock on stackoverflow. Along with a description.
[12:10:57] <_genuser_> it was an interesting read.
[12:10:59] <__ddd__> _genuser_ just scan the page every N seconds, if new element is detected then fire event. then listen for that event and remove the class
[12:11:37] <_genuser_> __ddd__: that would remove the annoying factor. but the item/script/object will still have loaded, added cookies, started other downloads, etc.
[12:12:27] <__ddd__> _genuser_ do you already have a way of avoiding all of that, but performance is still an issue?
[12:13:05] <__ddd__> maybe you can use a webworker to load it first and sandbox that environment somehow
[12:16:39] <_genuser_> __ddd__: I already have a way of iterating thru each element as it's being added (via mutation observers). I'm now trying match its class name to a blacklist.
[12:17:10] <_genuser_> __ddd__: so I was asking how to check if string s exists in array X. something straightforward like if (s in X) something();
[12:17:11] <__ddd__> gotcha. indexOf is what I would do
[12:17:33] <_genuser_> ah, I was trying out some along with indexOf. kinda neat how .some() works.
[12:17:51] <__ddd__> not familiar with some, tldr?
[12:18:35] <_genuser_> some(func), allows you to pass a func which is called for each element and you can return true/false based on your logic.
[12:19:04] <_genuser_> in this case  .some(presentInBlackList)==true would trigger a delete.
[12:19:22] <__ddd__> yeah just read the docs. that's pretty cool, I bet indexOf is faster though
[12:20:02] <_genuser_> __ddd__: both are arrays. :) className (is space separate list of classes.
[12:20:13] <_genuser_> so I end up check is array 1 items are present in array 2.
[12:20:23] <_genuser_> currently, doing array1.foreach(), ...
[12:20:39] <_genuser_> within there, going to array2.indexOf each item
[12:20:54] <__ddd__> there is probably a better way for comparing two arrays
[12:20:58] <__ddd__> php has array_diff
[12:22:19] <_genuser_> hmm, that's a good google search to compare arrays in javascript. let me googel that.
[12:23:02] <__ddd__> for something like this I'd just try to find the highest-level JS prototype to do what I'm trying to do, I'd imagine it executes faster than stringing together lower-level functions
[12:23:16] <__ddd__> not to mention is easier to read
[12:25:27] <__ddd__> while there's some quiet, I've got a question: does anyone in here dynamically batch get requests together and send them off in a single post request? or am I a leper?
[12:28:27] <taplar_lunch> is there a reason you can't build the single request yourself?
[12:28:42] <__ddd__> yes because doing things dynamically is better. more efficient of my time.
[12:28:51] <taplar_lunch> not in this case
[12:28:58] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:29:02] <__ddd__> sick burn dawg
[12:29:07] <robertmaxrees> but you can still built it dynamically.
[12:29:09] <robertmaxrees> *build
[12:29:15] <taplar_lunch> how is writing two ajax calls and letting script modify it for you faster than just writing the single call?
[12:29:20] <taplar_lunch> two = many
[12:30:24] <__ddd__> because each page has different ajax calls on it? I'm not sure what's hard to understand about the utility of this lol
[12:30:40] <robertmaxrees> because it's super easy to write something similar yourself.
[12:30:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm not doubting the utlity of sending a single request vs 50.
[12:31:46] <taplar_lunch> so each page with different ajax call batches, your going to create multiple functions with the multiple ajax calls in it that you want to batch up
[12:32:07] <__ddd__> robertmaxrees: what i'm trying to understand is why dynamically combining requests is not a common practice.
[12:32:24] <robertmaxrees> __ddd__ you're getting really hung up on the idea of replacing $.get()
[12:32:26] <taplar_lunch> cause most people design their endpoints as a unit of work, like i said before
[12:32:29] <__ddd__> taplar_lunch: it looks more like batch.add(function(){$.get(...);}
[12:32:37] <robertmaxrees> posting a single object is pretty common.
[12:32:43] <robertmaxrees> so just build the object.
[12:32:48] <robertmaxrees> or array.
[12:32:50] <taplar_lunch> ^
[12:33:08] <robertmaxrees> that's all that plugin is doing for you - it's creating an object to post to your server.
[12:33:10] <__ddd__> so the part you take issue with is that this piggybacks on jquery $.get functionality?
[12:33:23] <__ddd__> robertmaxrees: no it handles the response too
[12:33:30] <robertmaxrees> you can do all of that yourself.
[12:33:39] <taplar_lunch> personally the issue i take is you are making the effort to make multple ajax calls, vs just making one
[12:33:41] <robertmaxrees> why are you so resistant to building something out yourself?
[12:33:44] <taplar_lunch> and using a plugin to combine them
[12:33:55] <taplar_lunch> seems like you are interjecting an extra step.  more work
[12:34:08] <__ddd__> taplar_lunch i'm refactoring code
[12:34:20] <__ddd__> as I mentioned at the beginning of this conversation
[12:34:25] <robertmaxrees> __ddd__ so why not just write the trivial setup yourself?
[12:34:25] <__ddd__> the $.get requests exist already
[12:34:39] <robertmaxrees> if you're refactoring, then just to the refactor.
[12:35:47] <__ddd__> "why not build it yourself". because time.
[12:36:01] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty quick, but okay :)
[12:37:27] <__ddd__> this object you're talking about sending... is it a collection of GET requests?
[12:37:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:37:44] <robertmaxrees> it's just an object with whatever pertinent data you need to get your data.
[12:37:51] <__ddd__> so you're talking about specifying every data point I need?
[12:37:54] <__ddd__> no thank you.
[12:37:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:38:10] <robertmaxrees> you could have a "type" property.
[12:38:17] <robertmaxrees> and your backend knows how to handle that.
[12:38:27] <robertmaxrees> but you seem pretty set in how you want to do this so (shrug)
[12:38:29] <robertmaxrees> good luck i guess
[12:40:36] <__ddd__> I already have the individualized endpoints, that sounds like duplicated work. Any solution that doesn't utilize existing endpoints is duplicated work and/or more convoluted than it needs to be. I'm not 'set in how I want to do this', otherwise I wouldn't be here.
[12:40:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:41:01] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[12:42:35] <robertmaxrees> you already have get requests pointing to different endpoints.  you can easily create names for each of those and in your array have a type property for each object that describes the same thing.
[12:42:50] <robertmaxrees> there's no duplicated work - you're fully replacing the current get requests.
[12:43:47] <__ddd__> ok if that's your point then you're disagreeing over nothing lol
[12:44:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:44:11] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're not understanding what we're trying to tell you but alright.
[12:44:13] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:44:28] <__ddd__> you're just adding in an abstraction that I don't need
[12:44:35] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:44:42] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what that plugin would do.
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> sooooo
[12:46:35] <__ddd__> you're saying send in a name, and have the server call the endpoint with that name. I'm saying send in the path and have the server jump right to that endpoint.
[12:46:47] <robertmaxrees> then do that.
[12:47:32] <__ddd__> I will. I thought you were suggesting more than an aesthetic difference based on your insistence that I'm doing it wrong.
[12:48:02] <taplar_lunch> wrong is emotional, :)
[12:48:03] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[12:48:07] <taplar_lunch> incorrect is logical
[12:48:09] <taplar_lunch> ;)
[12:48:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:48:46] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[12:48:56] <taplar_lunch> you get what i'm saying
[12:49:20] <robertmaxrees> these allergy meds are still screwing with me.
[12:49:22] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[12:50:02] <__ddd__> 'wrong' was the right choice, because my technique is just as valid and practically identical to what you described. with the only difference being that I want to piggyback off of $.get calls in my code
[12:50:19] <taplar_lunch> code has no morality to it
[12:50:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:50:28] <robertmaxrees> alright alright alright.
[12:51:01] <robertmaxrees> __ddd__ i was more getting a sense that you thought my entire idea was just absurd - I suggested you do that because you seemed to take issue with the idea that you'd just put the whole path in there.
[12:51:05] <robertmaxrees> looks like i misunderstood.
[12:53:23] <__ddd__> robertmaxrees: I really just wanted to get a feel for the ways in which my approach will deviate from best practices. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that I'm piggybacking off of $.get . Really just want confirmation of that, I'm not suggesting that you're method wouldn't work as well.
[12:53:38] <__ddd__> *your
[12:53:55] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.  i always tell people to not override core methods.
[12:54:28] <__ddd__> its only overridden when it's inside the plugin's context, but point taken
[13:01:04] <taplar_lunch> did we get a resolution?  i'm still lost in my french fries
[13:01:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:01:20] <robertmaxrees> i think we did.
[13:02:43] <__ddd__> yes. thank you robertmaxrees
[13:04:56] <laravelnewbie> hello
[13:05:06] <taplar> aloha
[13:05:07] <MassDebates> hello lara
[13:05:14] <MassDebates> laravelnewbie *
[13:05:37] <laravelnewbie> I dont know if this could be done with jQuery, but I can ask though
[13:06:02] <laravelnewbie> So, I have a button that open up another website, I need to check if that website was really visited
[13:06:18] <taplar> already ?
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> laravelnewbie you mean if the user actually went to the other site?
[13:06:51] <laravelnewbie> yes robertmaxrees
[13:07:08] <taplar> you mean as opposed to like a popup blocker stopping it?
[13:07:10] <robertmaxrees> that's a really tough one.
[13:07:30] <robertmaxrees> taplar as in they want to verify the user actually looked at it instead of just opened.
[13:07:39] <taplar> ouch
[13:07:43] <laravelnewbie> taplar no popup
[13:08:03] <taplar> sorry i equate new tabs still to popups
[13:08:05] <laravelnewbie> something like <a href="#" target="_blank">Open</a>
[13:08:21] <robertmaxrees> you can't really check.
[13:08:26] <MassDebates> well
[13:08:30] <MassDebates> Google Analytics has some stuff you can use
[13:08:33] <robertmaxrees> you can only verify that the page opened.
[13:08:43] <robertmaxrees> laravelnewbie do you own the other site?
[13:08:44] <MassDebates> but it can be largely inaccurate, especially if they don't touch the destination site
[13:08:46] <taplar> is the page you are opening on the same domain?
[13:08:55] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:08:59] <taplar> :D
[13:09:00] <MassDebates> Answer robert and taplar first
[13:09:00] <laravelnewbie> robertmaxrees: that website could be facebook page or something else
[13:09:13] <taplar> welp, there goes my idea
[13:09:14] <MassDebates> Oh, yeah, you're in a bitchin' spot there.
[13:09:17] <MassDebates> LOL
[13:09:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there's not really much you can do there.  you can't really check that.
[13:09:26] <laravelnewbie> :/
[13:09:42] <laravelnewbie> so sad
[13:09:49] <robertmaxrees> you can only confirm that they clicked the button.
[13:09:58] <laravelnewbie> yeah, I know how to do that
[13:10:12] <laravelnewbie> I just wanted to know if they actually opened it
[13:10:36] <laravelnewbie> do you guys know gleam.io ?
[13:10:47] <taplar> slept with my sister
[13:10:49] <taplar> the bastard
[13:10:53] <laravelnewbie> xD
[13:10:54] <robertmaxrees> sounds vaguely familiar.
[13:11:02] <laravelnewbie> it's a giveaway website
[13:11:43] <laravelnewbie> they have an option where you put "visit 'somepage' on facebook", there's the button. I tried to just click it, but it doesnt work like that
[13:11:48] <laravelnewbie> you have to visit the page
[13:12:23] <robertmaxrees> check to see if focusing your window on any other page works.
[13:12:23] <__ddd__> you load the page in an iframe off your domain?
[13:12:28] <__ddd__> *can you
[13:12:43] <laravelnewbie> no __ddd__
[13:13:03] <taplar> it is possible to target an iframe with an a tag.  might not make business sense though
[13:13:15] <laravelnewbie> what you mean robert?
[13:13:15] <taplar> if this is a business thing
[13:13:15] <robertmaxrees> and not all sites will load in an iframe.
[13:13:33] <robertmaxrees> laravelnewbie have another window open for another site.
[13:13:43] <__ddd__> ok what if you load a blank page, then onfocus navigate to the real destination
[13:13:45] <robertmaxrees> when you click for facebook or whatever, click on your other window instead.
[13:13:56] <robertmaxrees> then go back - does it register the view?
[13:14:13] <robertmaxrees> __ddd__ that's basically the same as a click :) but it is a step closer.
[13:14:18] <laravelnewbie> let me check robert
[13:14:40] <MassDebates> I just realized
[13:15:01] <MassDebates> If you say "JQ" with an accent (like abbreviating jquery) it sounds like you're saying Gentleman's Quartlery
[13:15:04] <MassDebates> Quarterly*
[13:15:10] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:15:38] <taplar> like an australian accent?
[13:15:40] <laravelnewbie> it does robertmaxrees
[13:15:45] <robertmaxrees> laravelnewbie hahahahahaha
[13:15:52] <MassDebates> taplar
[13:15:56] <robertmaxrees> laravelnewbie then there's your answer.  they just check if the window lost focus.
[13:15:56] <MassDebates> if you have to ask you can't afford it
[13:16:00] <MassDebates> er wait
[13:16:00] <laravelnewbie> but it was opened though
[13:16:08] <taplar> heh, that's true without asking
[13:16:10] <robertmaxrees> sure - but you didn't actually VISIT the page.
[13:16:15] <MassDebates> Fuck it, I'm sticking with that one :P
[13:16:38] <laravelnewbie> I didn't close it robert
[13:16:43] <laravelnewbie> so it can count it's a vist
[13:16:48] <laravelnewbie> visit*
[13:16:51] <robertmaxrees> laravelnewbie huh?
[13:16:54] <robertmaxrees> laravelnewbie i think you're lost.
[13:16:55] <laravelnewbie> no ?
[13:17:03] <robertmaxrees> it looks like the window is just checking if it lost focus.
[13:17:13] <laravelnewbie> ah
[13:17:16] <robertmaxrees> so it's not checking if you went to a particular page, just if the current page lost focus.
[13:17:20] <laravelnewbie> I got ya
[13:17:39] <taplar> side question, kinda related
[13:17:45] <taplar> do you control the page they are going to?
[13:17:51] <laravelnewbie> no :(
[13:18:04] <taplar> so no chance of putting a tracking beacon or something on there
[13:18:31] <taplar> boo
[13:18:37] <laravelnewbie> no problem. I got robert's thinking :)
[13:18:45] <al_nz1> morning peeps
[13:19:18] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning
[13:19:19] <laravelnewbie> thanks robertmaxrees taplar and MassDebates ;)
[13:19:24] <robertmaxrees> laravelnewbie good luck!
[13:21:17] <laravelnewbie> just one more question robertmaxrees. Can I stop jquery to see if it's actually focusout() ?
[13:21:24] <robertmaxrees> "stop jquery"?
[13:21:30] <robertmaxrees> you can bind an event listener.
[13:21:41] <laravelnewbie> in console ?
[13:21:44] <robertmaxrees> sure
[13:21:59] <laravelnewbie> how would I do it?
[13:22:12] <robertmaxrees> bind an event listener?
[13:22:32] <laravelnewbie> yes
[13:22:37] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[13:22:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:23:05] <MassDebates> HA
[13:23:09] <MassDebates> Robert and taplar
[13:23:15] <laravelnewbie> okay
[13:23:16] <taplar> hmm?
[13:23:31] <MassDebates> you guys suck at this game. I can get just as much gratitude as you guys without doing -ANY- of the work
[13:23:36] <MassDebates> pls noobs
[13:23:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:24:15] <taplar> i don't really consider chatting work, :P
[13:24:23] <robertmaxrees> oh hahahahaha
[13:25:00] <MassDebates> Regardless, I'm winning, which is what matters most.
[13:25:14] <MassDebates> Pretty sure It's Mass/Rob/TappyTaps: 1/0/0
[13:25:18] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[13:25:19] <taplar> :O gah, what was that guys name
[13:25:29] <taplar> winning!
[13:25:45] <taplar> whatever, not important
[13:29:42] <taplar> charley!
[13:35:48] <taplar> and now i'm humming kesha.  interesting day
[13:40:22] <AwkwardCough> tick tok
[13:48:09] <taplar> yep, :)
[14:25:08] <lemonsparrow> is there a way to identify between mouse click and enter press key 13 ? right now I dont want mouse click to trigger key 13 press event..
[14:25:44] <taplar> those are two different events man
[14:26:11] <taplar> 'click' vs 'keydown'/'keypress'/'keyup'
[14:26:24] <lemonsparrow> taplar: yes but right now when I click on text field also the event is triggered
[14:26:41] <lemonsparrow>     $(document).bind('keypress', function(e) {         if (e.which == 13) {
[14:26:45] <lemonsparrow> this is my code
[14:26:56] <taplar> and your saying that click it fires that?
[14:27:08] <lemonsparrow> but it is working for both enter press in keyboard and click event as well.. I dont want click on input to trigger event
[14:27:16] <lemonsparrow> taplar: yep
[14:27:23] <taplar> can you make a fiddle showing that?
[14:27:30] <taplar> and use on() instead of bind()
[14:27:43] <lemonsparrow> taplar: ok let me try that
[14:28:16] <lemonsparrow> taplar: no use
[14:28:32] <taplar> can you show the issue in a fiddle?
[14:28:41] <lemonsparrow> ok
[14:28:58] <lemonsparrow> taplar: 1 minute
[14:30:49] <lemonsparrow> taplar: strage.. works fine in fiddle.. something wrong with my code perhaps
[14:30:51] <lemonsparrow> il check
[14:30:57] <taplar> :)
[14:35:13] <lemonsparrow> taplar: resolved it :)
[14:35:44] <MuzlL0dr> @lemonsparrow Curious what the problem was...
[15:09:59] <aphpperson> I went to a random site (canva.com) and was looking to replicate the unblur background image in the place of the mouse hover only. Does anyone know if something like this comes from a jQuery framework? Or is this some custom thing that I'd have to replicate?
[15:10:48] <robertmaxrees> a what now?
[15:11:02] <robertmaxrees> like unblur an image on hover?
[15:11:21] <aphpperson> like, having a blurred image, but when you move over specific portions a radius around the cursor unblors
[15:11:27] <aphpperson> unblurs*
[15:11:49] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[15:11:55] <robertmaxrees> there may be a plugin for that.
[15:11:56] <robertmaxrees> no idea.
[15:12:38] <aphpperson> ah, okay. just figured I'd ask in case it was a well known library. Am looking to adapt something like this for mobile
[15:36:59] <MuzlL0dr> Could you do it by just adding/removing a class?
[15:38:06] <MuzlL0dr> Oh wow, I should look at the timestamp before I reply... :rolls eyes: Sorry.
[16:51:21] <JIds> I have mulitple .slot selectors
[16:51:36] <JIds> I want to delete all apart from bottom .slot:last-child
[16:51:42] <JIds> How would I write that?
[16:51:49] <robertmaxrees> use .not()
[16:52:05] <robertmaxrees> $('.slot').not(':last-child').remove();
[16:52:13] <JIds> Good idea
[16:52:30] <JIds> I was thinking use .lenth to count it  and then use each loop to remove each one
[16:52:31] <rjCousineau> Hi. I have a <tr class="group1"> .. then a bunch of <tr> and then another <tr class="group2">  how can I select before() the tr.group2 from tr.group1?  $('tr.group1').nextUntil('.group2').before() seems to select all <tr>?
[16:52:34] <JIds> your is better
[16:54:29] <MassDebates> you could use other selectors too, and your way -is- possible, but rob's solution is simplest, easiest, and best.
[16:54:33] <MassDebates> @ JIds
[16:55:48] <JIds>  rob's solution  is awesome
[16:55:56] <JIds> How do I send him some cookies?
[16:56:49] <robertmaxrees> haha
[16:58:14] <JIds> :)
[16:58:20] <JIds> Do you think of vue.js
[16:58:23] <JIds> I like it.
[16:58:51] <robertmaxrees> i don't use it.
[17:00:04] <JIds>  var $clone = $(thisAddSlotBtn).closest('.time-container:last-child').clone().appendTo(".time-slots");
[17:00:20] <JIds> This code is working but it does not get the :last-child ?
[17:00:37] <JIds> It seem it getting the first-child
[17:01:00] <robertmaxrees> do you want the last-child of .time-container?
[17:01:12] <JIds> yep
[17:01:26] <robertmaxrees> you're currently selecting the last .time-container.
[17:01:52] <robertmaxrees> you could do $('.time-container').children().last()
[17:03:54] <JIds> Ahhh I know what the problem
[17:04:14] <JIds> It is getting last-child but it is not selecting the correct option
[17:04:35] <JIds> <option> </option>
[17:05:08] <JIds> It is not getting the selected option from the last-child.
[17:05:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see code i guess.
[17:06:54] <JIds> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/atg5m6ym/8046/
[17:07:10] <JIds> select day and then click on "Add More Shift"
[17:07:24] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:07:28] <robertmaxrees> don't use .clone() for this.
[17:07:42] <robertmaxrees> get you some client-side templating.
[17:08:35] <JIds> I can't use template system right now :/
[17:08:45] <robertmaxrees> why?
[17:09:44] <JIds> which template do you like?
[17:09:52] <robertmaxrees> you could just use a string in this case.
[17:10:09] <robertmaxrees> or at least grab the clone on pageload instead of every time the user clicks the button.
[17:10:14] <quechon> before using jquery i used to send back to server a variable when the the form was submitted example <form key={{ var }}> i was able to retrieve the key value in the server-side
[17:10:30] <quechon> how can i do that with jquery
[17:10:37] <robertmaxrees> quechon $.ajax()
[17:10:40] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, a normal form.
[17:11:32] <quechon> im using ajax to submit data from text boxes already but i need to send back a user id at the same time
[17:11:50] <robertmaxrees> quechon to the page you mean?
[17:12:19] <quechon> to the server that way i know you posted the data
[17:12:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:12:38] <robertmaxrees> you just said you're sending it already though.
[17:16:30] <quechon> with flask using request.args i was able to retrieve a variable containing the user id without the user knowing that used to happened automatically
[17:16:50] <quechon> but with jquery form normal behavior doesnt work
[17:17:08] <quechon> so i can no longer get tha var
[17:17:10] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do anything you don't tell it to do.
[17:17:16] <robertmaxrees> so show me some code or something.
[17:28:49] <quechon> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/0dWbJeW10psVBKI7qNO5/
[17:29:00] <quechon> hope this explain what i mean
[17:29:19] <quechon> passing a argument back to the server
[17:29:47] <robertmaxrees> the data will be formatted differently.
[17:30:10] <robertmaxrees> you're senting an object back over - check out your framework's documentation for info on how to handle JSOn in post bodies.
[17:30:45] <robertmaxrees> *sending
[17:52:24] <quechon> <input id="hide" type="hidden" name="data" value="{{ a }}">
[17:52:38] <quechon> was able to retrieve the value using this
[17:52:49] <quechon> dont know if it is a good way
[17:53:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:53:20] <robertmaxrees> are you evenm using the js any more?
[17:53:25] <robertmaxrees> *even
[17:53:27] <quechon> yes
[17:53:31] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:53:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost but ok.
[17:54:50] <quechon> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/gejbYgCVmfw2j8c9LPSH/
[17:55:13] <robertmaxrees> oh, you weren't including that in the post body.
[17:55:14] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[17:55:31] <robertmaxrees> anything you want to send to the server has to be explicitly included in that data object.
[17:56:29] <quechon> ok thanks
[19:23:14] <ahhughes> I'm trying to convert an Element into a jQuery object, but its not working.... should the following work.....  $(document.body)  because it currently returns undefined
[19:25:06] <robertmaxrees> that works.
[19:25:13] <robertmaxrees> just checked here.
[19:36:29] <Jacob144> Hey, I'm trying to follow this tutorial, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxyfLUx7iBk and I copied everything as I saw it but it isn't working, would someone review my code? http://codepen.io/Jacob144/pen/zooLRV?editors=1010
[19:37:00] <robertmaxrees> you haven't loaded jquery there :)
[19:37:27] <robertmaxrees> oh, looks like it should be.
[19:37:28] <robertmaxrees> hrmm.
[19:37:48] <robertmaxrees> oh you got jquery ui but not jquery itself.
[19:37:53] <Jacob144> That's my problem
[19:38:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:38:21] <Jacob144> changed it but it still isn't working
[19:38:33] <robertmaxrees> and you're loading jquery before jquery ui?
[19:39:20] <Jacob144> and now?
[19:39:23] <MuzlL0dr> On your var declarations.
[19:39:28] <MuzlL0dr> You have "toatalSlides"
[19:39:31] <MuzlL0dr> instead of "totalSlides"
[19:39:43] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah that too.
[19:39:46] <robertmaxrees> open yer console.
[19:39:48] <robertmaxrees> thjat'll help.
[19:40:16] <qakhan> hi all, please see my following working link. i have "Driver" and "Group" tables.if i double click on Driver table record it moves to Group table and vise versa. if i click on Driver table record and click >> button it moves to Group table and vise versa. I want to create Groups by pressing Add group button and add records by double click or single click as i am doing now to newly created group.
[19:40:16] <qakhan> i get driver table data from DB. once group created with all its record save them to DB, so next time user can see his/her created groups.
[19:40:21] <MuzlL0dr> Also, in the preloader, "totalslides" instead of "totalSlides"
[19:40:29] <qakhan> here is my code https://jsfiddle.net/qb06o0zh/19/
[19:40:50] <robertmaxrees> qakhan that's a whole lot of description.
[19:40:55] <robertmaxrees> can you condense that down at all?
[19:41:30] <qakhan> it was detail what i want to achive
[19:41:54] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the issue?
[19:41:56] <robertmaxrees> where's the error?
[19:42:01] <robertmaxrees> or have you not tried the new thing yet?
[19:42:11] <qakhan> main goal is create groups in table and add records from t1 to t2 gourps
[19:42:41] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the question?
[19:42:54] <robertmaxrees> you've stated what you';re trying to do but not where you're getting hung up.
[19:44:12] <Jacob144> MMM, still not working,
[19:44:16] <qakhan> i can create group
[19:44:44] <qakhan> but it add as cell in t2, i want to add it as whole row
[19:45:08] <robertmaxrees> so you want to append a row, not a cell?
[19:45:14] <robertmaxrees> then grab the row instead.
[19:45:23] <qakhan> then select that newly created group and add records from t1 by double clicking on records
[19:45:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:45:59] <MuzlL0dr> Jacob144: Double check your spellings and cases.
[19:46:03] <robertmaxrees> so break that down into each step.
[19:46:11] <robertmaxrees> Jacob144 update and toss out a new link :)
[19:46:16] <taplar> what what little i'm seeing your going to have an issue because you are creating new rows without datatables involvement, qakhan
[19:46:35] <MuzlL0dr> Jacbo144: "new image();" has to be "new Image();"
[19:47:20] <Jacob144> http://codepen.io/Jacob144/pen/zooLRV?editors=1010
[19:47:47] <MuzlL0dr> Jacob144: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PbbBVO?editors=1011
[19:47:47] <Jacob144> It seems to be working better but how do I remove the list dot, In CSS?
[19:47:48] <qakhan> robertmaxrees i selected tr only but again its adding as 1st cell
[19:47:56] <robertmaxrees> qakhan look at what taplar said.
[19:48:04] <MuzlL0dr> Oh, nvm, looks like you got it.
[19:48:34] <MuzlL0dr> Jacob144: <ul style="list-style: none;">
[19:48:34] <qakhan> taplar table is already thee
[19:48:39] <qakhan> there*
[19:48:41] <taplar> does not matter
[19:48:50] <taplar> datatables keeps an internal reference to the data it draws
[19:48:56] <taplar> so it can handle paging and such
[19:49:14] <taplar> ln 85 and on is creating a new row and adding it to the table, without using the datatable methods
[19:49:15] <robertmaxrees> doesn't DT have an api for adding/removing stuff?
[19:49:19] <taplar> yep
[19:49:24] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[19:49:28] <robertmaxrees> use that.
[19:49:39] <qakhan> ok, so what should i do?
[19:49:44] <taplar> and he's doing something like that, or along the lines, on ln 68
[19:50:15] <taplar> you'll have to look at the docs.  there are methods for adding rows and such
[19:50:25] <Jacob144> Muzil0dr: Why does both pictures show up in till the first animation plays?
[19:50:37] <Jacob144> Shouldn't it hid the other image?
[19:52:07] <taplar> https://datatables.net/examples/api/add_row.html
[19:52:29] <MuzlL0dr> Jacob144: Until jQuery has loaded and started doing its thing, you're going to see whatever is in the HTML.
[19:53:12] <taplar> and you are going to have to add enough data for every cell of the table, otherwise DT is going to flip it's shit
[19:55:03] <Jacob144> Ah
[19:57:35] <taplar> (slideCount < totalSlides - 1) ? slideCount ++ : slideCount = 0; :s
[19:58:24] <Jacob144> Just following the tutorial, PS: I'm new
[19:58:29] <taplar> slideCount = ++slideCount % totalSlides;
[20:00:01] <Jacob144> taplar: I didn't see anything change
[20:00:10] <taplar> same logic, a little less typing
[20:00:20] <Jacob144> ah
[20:00:41] <taplar> you can use modulus in that case instead of ternary
[20:01:03] <qakhan> taplar i am looking at row.data()
[20:01:39] <qakhan> i ll let you know
[20:01:49] <u2fly> Chuck
[20:01:58] <taplar> lol
[20:02:23] <qakhan> but i want whole row be as heading of records
[20:02:43] <taplar> i'm not exactly sure how your going to do that part
[20:07:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qb06o0zh/31/ <-- the row is being added atleast
[20:07:59] <taplar> have you seen an example of a datatable that does grouping?
[20:08:55] <taplar> holy crap, https://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/row_grouping.html
[20:08:59] <taplar> it exists, :)
[20:10:23] <taplar> yet my hatred still burns...
[21:16:48] <qakhan> taplar i am working on it
[22:34:34] <jak2000> how to remove the commas on a text field? this not work: $(this).val($(this).val().replace(/,/g,''));
[22:37:32] <systemfault> Of course it won't work... lol
[22:37:44] <systemfault> You're modifying the string that is returned from val...
[22:37:52] <systemfault> Instead of passing the result _to_ val
[22:38:20] <jak2000> error
[22:38:21] <jak2000> work

[23:25:35] <GeekMonkey> Hey all
[23:25:55] <GeekMonkey> I have this script and ONLY on ios I get an error unexpected token >
[23:25:57] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KWpfW2C1ivgtrqa5KDZ
[23:26:02] <GeekMonkey> this is the script
[23:26:09] <GeekMonkey> any thoughts why that would happen
[23:26:44] <GeekMonkey> line 4,7,14 seem to be the issue
[23:27:19] <GeekMonkey> You can edit the code if you want
[23:27:27] <shoky_> GeekMonkey: probably no arrow functions in the browser version you're using
[23:27:40] <shoky_> they are kinda new
[23:27:42] <shoky_> in js
[23:29:06] <GeekMonkey> shoky_ any thoughts on how to rewrite the js
[23:29:13] <GeekMonkey> I am using this https://github.com/camwiegert/in-view
[23:29:17] <shoky_> GeekMonkey: don't use arrow functions
[23:29:20] <shoky_> use regular functions
[23:29:52] <shoky_> function(el) { ... }     instead of:    el => { ... }
[23:30:18] <GeekMonkey> ah
[23:30:27] <shoky_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
[23:31:08] <GeekMonkey> Just updated my code
