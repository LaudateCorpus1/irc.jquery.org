[02:35:03] <ifohancroft> I have an array in a file. How do I get it inside a variable in a jQuery script so I can iterate over it? I've tried whatever I could think of and it couldn't work. If I just copy paste it into a var into the script and console.log it shows up properly and says it's array
[02:35:32] <ifohancroft> It has the following syntax: ['element','element']
[02:47:56] <ifohancroft> the array is generating by php doing json_encode on a php array
[02:48:21] <ifohancroft> i've been trying for a very long time but for the life of me I couldn't get jQuery to get the array from file and be able to use it
[03:02:39] <ifohancroft> I've tried:
[03:02:40] <ifohancroft> var json = JSON.parse('createPlaylist.php');
[03:02:40] <ifohancroft> console.log(json)
[03:02:44] <ifohancroft> But I get:
[03:02:50] <ifohancroft> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data[Learn More]
[03:03:04] <ifohancroft> However I checked the syntax of the json using an online json validator and it was valid
[03:03:54] <ifohancroft> I am desparate :X
[03:12:30] <Uhkis> ifohancroft: make a fiddle
[03:21:32] <ifohancroft> Uhkis I am not ok with sharing my json. Should I just share the jQuery code
[03:42:26] <Uhkis> ifohancroft: well if the part that's broken is unshareable, we can't really help
[09:46:59] <momomo> $(document.activeElement)
[09:47:03] <momomo> when I do $(element).focus() the element is scrolling to the top despite the element already scrolled .. is there a way to prevent that ?

[22:45:35] <themediator> I'm having some trouble with my $.ajax() function. It seems to be adding the contents of the "data" attribute to the end of the URL that it is sending the request to. Does anyone know how to stop it from doing that?
[22:46:21] <themediator> My URL is in the form of url: '{% url "ajax:submitform" %} for use in django
