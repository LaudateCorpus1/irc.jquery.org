[00:12:06] <chovy> is there a way to delete an item from a jquery collection?
[00:12:18] <chovy> i have $els = $('.foo');
[00:12:33] <chovy> and i want to loop over them and manually delete that item from $els
[00:12:39] <chovy> inside the loop
[00:20:32] <twilight> chovy: you can use $(".foo").each(function(index) { // Here the code }); Replace "// Here the code" with a condition to find the element you want to remove, or use another array variable that will contain all the items in the .each() loop except the ones you don't want. If you need to remove the item from the DOM, too, then use http://api.jquery.com/remove/ on it
[00:23:24] <dan2k3k4> with $(elem).tabs() -> how can I set the class of all previous tabs to "active" (or add/remove some other class)?
[00:23:57] <dan2k3k4> as in tab 0 -> active; but when tab 1 -> active - then also leave/make tab 0 appear active too... it's to sort of show 'step' progression
[01:01:31] <Omar-> good morning everyone!
[01:01:52] <drale2k> Guys i am looking for a sticky header lib whihc supports multiple elements. So when it hits the next element. it will overtake and stick to the top and so on
[01:04:39] <tacoshellmcgee> Good morning *nerds*
[01:20:09] <prohobo> jesus christ
[01:20:17] <prohobo> HTML5 isn't HTML5 at all! it's JS!
[01:20:23] <prohobo> i had no idea
[01:20:31] <Cork> no html5 is marketing
[01:20:38] <Cork> its everything under the sun
[01:20:42] <prohobo> why are we making games with a language designed in a week?
[01:20:45] <prohobo> why
[01:21:00] <Cork> the html specs name is "html"
[01:21:04] <Cork> not html5
[01:21:07] <prohobo> yeah
[01:21:27] <prohobo> honestly Cork, i used to think HTML5 was an actual language for HTML
[01:21:33] <prohobo> the way people made it out
[01:21:43] <prohobo> but it's literally the HTML canvas + JS
[01:21:47] <prohobo> a ton of JS
[01:22:07] <Cork> plus "interactivetly" + css + video + "every thing cool"
[01:22:08] <Uhkis> well it came with a few nice non-js changes
[01:22:26] <Uhkis> like the placeholder attribute
[01:22:29] <prohobo> yar
[01:22:30] <Cork> the living standard has a long list ya
[01:22:41] <Cork> like <template> for example
[01:22:51] <Cork> and <datalist>
[01:22:58] <Cork> and <nav> and...
[01:24:06] <Cork> prohobo: also js has gotten qute a bit further then what was designed in the min 90's
[01:24:17] <Cork> and is quite powerful now days
[01:24:23] <prohobo> it is
[01:24:32] <Cork> if it could just get a replacement for the dom api life would be niffy
[01:24:45] <prohobo> still
[01:24:49] <Cork> (dom't isn't actually part of js)
[01:25:02] <prohobo> when i found out an HTML5 game is a JS game i facepalmed
[01:25:09] <prohobo> wtf are people even talking about
[01:25:17] <Cork> well ya, how else would you have logic?
[01:25:27] <prohobo> i dunno, i really thought there was a new framework
[01:25:41] <Cork> also note flash uses js too
[01:25:49] <Uhkis> for some time i had the energy to correct people about html5 and js, lost cause
[01:25:50] <Cork> it just hides in a binary blob
[01:26:08] <Cork> Uhkis: i'm halfway there
[01:26:19] <Cork> but when they start asking "why isn't html5 supported" i cry
[01:26:31] <Cork> as it is impossible to know what they are asking
[01:27:07] <Cork> so i do a half lame attempt to stem the tide
[01:29:41] <prohobo> flash doesnt use JS
[01:29:50] <prohobo> flash is ECMAscript
[01:29:50] <Cork> it does
[01:29:55] <prohobo> its similar to JS
[01:29:56] <Cork> it uses actionscript
[01:29:59] <prohobo> ye
[01:30:14] <Cork> and actionscript is an implementation of ecmascript just like javascript is
[01:30:27] <Cork> javascript is actually only the ecmascript implementation in mozilla
[01:30:35] <Cork> ms use jscript
[01:30:43] <Cork> and apple.. don't remember the name there
[01:30:49] <Lebbe> what about google?
[01:30:49] <prohobo> actionscript is better than javascript imo
[01:30:50] <Cork> never heard a name for chrome
[01:31:18] <Cork> prohobo: i suspect you think of "javascript" as ecmascript 3.0
[01:31:30] <Cork> as that is basically the only thing that is supported cross browsers
[01:31:35] <prohobo> kind of, more like an offshoot of it
[01:31:42] <Lebbe> v8 javascript engine
[01:31:43] <Cork> javascript has gotten a long way from then
[01:31:53] <Lebbe> looks like google call their variant javascript as well
[01:31:59] <Cork> Lebbe: the engine ya, but not the name of the language implementation
[01:32:08] * Cork nods
[01:32:39] <Cork> prohobo: have a look at harmony/js7
[01:32:53] <Cork> and you WILL find how far js has gotten from what is cross browser today
[01:33:19] <Cork> it is actually what drives the entire ui in firefox
[01:33:38] <Cork> (js7+xul+css+html)
[01:33:46] <prohobo> hm
[01:34:14] <Cork> and they have a farly long going flash player implemented in js7 :)
[01:34:39] <Cork> but as you have to reverse enginere flash to get support it takes time to get it working
[01:34:51] <Cork> (there is no spec)
[01:34:57] <Cork> ?g shumway
[01:34:59] <b-ot> Cork: Shumway → http://mozilla.github.io/shumway/
[01:35:14] <prohobo> so
[01:35:22] <Cork> there is also
[01:35:23] <prohobo> flash is an obsolete version of JS
[01:35:24] <Cork> ?g pdf.js
[01:35:26] <b-ot> Cork: PDF.js → http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/
[01:35:39] <Cork> prohobo: its an obsolete animation solution
[01:35:44] <prohobo> that i know
[01:35:46] <Cork> eol by adobe even
[01:35:57] <Cork> and no you can't implement i soly in js
[01:36:22] <Cork> you need canvas + <video> and a few other bits and peaces too
[01:36:52] <Cork> pdf.js is used in release firefox btw
[01:37:08] <prohobo> interesting
[01:37:16] <Cork> not THAT special
[01:37:28] <Cork> something i find interesting and that actually shows how powerful js really is is
[01:37:34] <Cork> ?g emscripten
[01:37:35] <b-ot> Cork: kripken/emscripten · GitHub → https://github.com/kripken/emscripten
[01:37:51] <prohobo> i think i'll make my next game in js
[01:37:52] <Cork> ^ lets you compile programs to js
[01:38:27] <Cork> qemu (a virtualization platform) has been compiled for example
[01:38:41] <Cork> and the linux kernel has been ran in it -- IN YOUR BROWSER! :D
[01:41:32] <prohobo> jesus
[01:41:41] <prohobo> JS is the future it seems
[01:41:51] <prohobo> why is the language still all messed up though?
[01:42:03] <Cork> the language is quite solid
[01:42:10] <Cork> the dom spec is a mess though
[01:42:13] <abailarri> Hello. I have this script and I want to get a concret date formal. Whan can  I do? http://jsfiddle.net/bvLgupg6/1/
[01:42:27] <prohobo> yeah the DOM is a mess, i hate doing CSS
[01:42:37] <Cork> uh dom != css
[01:42:42] <Cork> css is quite fine
[01:42:46] <prohobo> it styles the dom though
[01:42:59] <Cork> the dom is what you use when you modify elements in the dom tree
[01:43:06] <Cork> dom == Document Object Model
[01:43:07] <Erwat> i hate life
[01:43:19] <tacoshellmcgee> Don't hate life anymore bby
[01:43:21] <prohobo> yeah
[01:43:28] <Erwat> i don't see myself ever figuring this shit out
[01:43:33] <Erwat> and i just don't know what to do at this point
[01:43:55] <tacoshellmcgee> It takes steps
[01:44:03] <tacoshellmcgee> What can't you figure out?
[01:44:03] <Erwat> tacoshellmcgee: why? there's literally nothing in it
[01:44:06] <Erwat> it's a piece of shit
[01:44:12] <tacoshellmcgee> What's a pos? lawl
[01:44:18] <Erwat> life
[01:44:35] <Erwat> and it doesn't matter what problem i have, because it's just not possible to help me
[01:44:37] <tacoshellmcgee> Well what in life is troubling you? learning jquery?
[01:44:45] <Cork> abailarri: you would have to create the date string you're self
[01:44:51] <Cork> dates SUCKS in js
[01:44:58] <Cork> its really horribly bad
[01:45:14] <Lebbe> it seems standard implementation of dates sucks in most languages
[01:45:15] <Erwat> #jquery to me is the javascript channel where you can get actual answers
[01:45:53] <Cork> Lebbe: true, though you at least have format print in basically every other language
[01:46:00] <abailarri> Cork, then, how can I convert unix timestamp (var exp_date) to date like 08/09/2015?
[01:46:10] <Erwat> i hope i get hit by a car or something when going for lunch so i don't have to deal with this shit anymore
[01:46:15] <Cork> abailarri: date.getFullYear() and so on
[01:46:19] <Cork> ?g mdn Date
[01:46:20] <b-ot> Cork: Date - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[01:47:23] <Cork> (also i hate those date formats why do ppl still use them -_-')
[01:47:42] <Cork> is that sep of 2015 or oct?
[01:47:48] <Cork> - answer: depends -_-'
[01:47:58] <Erwat> just use 08.01.2015
[01:48:05] <Cork> ya... so much better
[01:48:08] <Lebbe> well
[01:48:13] <Lebbe> same questions apply
[01:48:18] <Lebbe> is that januaru or august
[01:48:22] <Cork> exactly
[01:48:23] <Lebbe> january*
[01:48:34] <Cork> there is an iso standard that only allows one format
[01:48:38] <Cork> yyyy-mm-dd
[01:49:07] <Cork> simple and unambiguous
[01:49:20] <Lebbe> i either use dd mm yyyy or yyyy mm dd. the most stupid shit I see is mm dd yyyy.
[01:49:25] <Cork> and even better! it sorts!
[01:49:46] <Cork> Lebbe: dd mm yyyy has the problem of not sorting
[01:49:52] <Lebbe> yes
[01:49:54] <Erwat> i don't think there's a single accepted standard out there where you do mm.dd.yyyy
[01:49:57] <Lebbe> only americans use that crazy stuff
[01:50:01] <Erwat> i think all of them are dd.mm.yyyy
[01:50:18] <Lebbe> hmm good
[01:50:18] <Cork> Erwat: the iso standard i talk about is what is dictated for most apis
[01:50:21] <Cork> its quite common
[01:50:40] <Lebbe> but what is wrong with ms since 1970
[01:50:48] <Cork> and is actually the only sain format Date.parse accepts
[01:50:58] <Cork> Lebbe: no timezone
[01:50:59] <Lebbe> not possible way to interpret that wrong
[01:51:08] <Lebbe> utc
[01:51:15] <Cork> if only
[01:51:19] <Erwat> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Date_format_by_country.svg cyan does day month year
[01:51:59] <Cork> http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15
[01:52:36] <Cork> YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ <-- i just love that the "T" isn't optional -_-'
[01:53:56] <Erwat> i would just like to point out that the cyan one is the majority of the world in population
[01:55:29] <Erwat> but just to make sure there's no confusion just write things down with the name of the month
[01:55:53] <Erwat> especially if you speak a language like japanese or chinese
[02:08:33] <prohobo> hey
[02:08:54] <prohobo> im having trouble with a script that won't finish
[02:09:16] <Omar-> ?ask prohobo
[02:09:28] <prohobo> https://dpaste.de/QJj8
[02:09:37] <prohobo> this loop totally kills my browser
[02:09:44] <prohobo> when there are 28 objects in the array
[02:11:40] <Cork> webchat...
[02:11:44] <Cork> weeee...
[02:11:55] <prohobo> sorry
[02:11:59] <prohobo> my computer crashed
[02:12:03] <Cork> ouch :D
[02:12:13] <Cork> prohobo: don't append content to the dom in a loop
[02:12:17] <Cork> it will kill performance
[02:12:18] <Omar-> prohobo you clone and then prepend and then clone the prepended element?
[02:12:19] <prohobo> yeah i figured
[02:12:26] <prohobo> no Omar~
[02:12:29] <Cork> build an array and then append them in one go
[02:12:31] <prohobo> there's only 1 element i clone
[02:12:45] <Omar-> i second Cork
[02:13:03] <prohobo> you mean like $(container).prepend(array)?
[02:13:09] <Omar-> prohobo then make the clone outside the loop since you clone it once
[02:13:09] <Cork> yes
[02:13:12] <prohobo> okay ty
[02:13:28] <prohobo> Omar~ but it needs to be cloned for each new element
[02:13:40] <Cork> make the selection outside
[02:13:44] <Omar-> ok
[02:13:46] <Cork> and clone the variable
[02:14:03] <prohobo> hmm
[02:14:04] <Cork> basically touch the dom as little as you can
[02:14:06] <prohobo> good idea :P
[02:20:14] <prohobo> nice thanks for help
[02:20:19] <prohobo> it works like it should now
[02:42:46] <hanzo2001> hello, this is my first time here, I don't want to report a bug just ask some questions about some strange behaviour
[02:43:16] <Uhkis> just ask
[02:45:10] <hanzo2001> strange behaviour: $(selector).append(element); throws typeerror ... ;; but $(selector)[0].appendChild(element[0]) works as intended
[02:45:28] <Uhkis> ?demo @ hanzo2001
[02:45:28] <b-ot> hanzo2001: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:46:00] <hanzo2001> ok... this might take some time. Thank you I'll be back when I have it online
[02:54:42] <krambiorix> hi , i want to add html code to an iframe coming from the database... http://jsfiddle.net/j4ktast2/  -> i get the error: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal  doc.write("<!DOCTYPE html>     anyone?
[02:57:10] <Cork> krambiorix: have you thought about the error?
[02:57:16] <Cork> it is quite descriptive
[02:59:14] <Uhkis> and the demo works fine after setting those missing vars
[02:59:21] <eilgin> hi there
[02:59:52] <eilgin> does anyone know a little about DOM ?
[03:00:18] <Uhkis> i'd say we know a lot
[03:00:48] <eilgin> i've got an issue with text insertion on input[type=text] in ie8
[03:01:03] <krambiorix> Cork, yes, i'm looking to escape the string
[03:01:27] <eilgin> idk how to do it properly, it just prepend the text not inserting at the caret position
[03:02:07] <DRSK> Cork » given the example you helped me with yesterday @ http://jsfiddle.net/xpb5tqk3/5/ how could I make the "clones" be surrounded by <div>'s as well? Right now it's duplicating <label>stuff</label> but omitting the <div>. I tried on line 22 to do .add( '<div>' + fields.clone() + '</div>' ); but it didn't want to function properly. ;p
[03:02:12] <eilgin> i saw the msdn doc (awful doc) but it seems not to work correctly either
[03:03:35] <Cork> krambiorix: you need to escape the string server side most likely
[03:03:54] <Cork> cause i suspect you do something like doc.write("<?php echo content; ?>");
[03:04:03] <Cork> and "content" has line breaks and breaks js
[03:04:32] <Cork> DRSK: why do you want those divs?
[03:05:08] <Cork> DRSK: i added the div to be able to identify the "template" element
[03:05:12] <Cork> so it doesn't get removed
[03:05:16] <DRSK> Ah
[03:05:31] <Cork> you can clone the div instead of the labels
[03:05:44] <Cork> but then you would have to mark the first div with a class or something so you don't remove it
[03:05:59] <DRSK> All right! Thank you :)
[03:08:13] <krambiorix> Cork,  yes indeed
[03:10:19] <Omar-> what's the difference between $(selector).append( $(foo).html() ) and $(selector).append( $(foo).children() )
[03:10:49] <Cork> the second one adds the children dom elements while the former adds the innerHTML string
[03:11:17] <Cork> so the first one serializes the content to an html string and then parses it again (including text in the parent)
[03:11:29] <Cork> while the former selects the dom childern and just moves them
[03:11:37] <Cork> (excluding text in the parent)
[03:12:07] <Cork> so $(selector).append($(foo).html()) is somewhat similar to $(selector).append($(foo).children().clone())
[03:12:24] <Cork> except for the text in the parent not getting copied
[03:12:35] <eilgin> this doesn't work in ie8 : http://jsbin.com/qasaxupero/1/edit
[03:12:50] <Omar-> Cork well said, thanks!
[03:13:07] <Cork> eilgin: please don't use jsbin
[03:13:11] <Cork> it loses changes
[03:14:14] <krambiorix> Cork, adding addslashes doesn't do the trick
[03:14:39] <Cork> krambiorix: you need to use c like escape
[03:15:11] <Cork> eilgin: the selection code for ie doesn't look right
[03:15:17] <Cork> are you sure that should work?
[03:15:28] <krambiorix> Cork, how do you mean?
[03:15:37] <eilgin> no i'm not that why i'm here :)
[03:15:47] <krambiorix> Cork, something like str_replace("'", "\'", ... ) ?
[03:16:21] <Cork> krambiorix: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/escape
[03:16:35] <Cork> note the "new line" section
[03:17:01] <Cork> krambiorix: simplest is to use the languages json encoder
[03:20:59] <eilgin> Cork : actually, it works on ie 8
[03:21:05] <eilgin> http://jsfiddle.net/cyj8d1sj/embedded/result/
[03:28:50] <krambiorix> Cork,     doc.write('<? echo json_encode(preg_replace("/`/", "", $page->content)); ?>');         ->    Error: missing ) after argument list
[03:29:26] <Cork> doc.write(<? echo json_encode($page->content); ?>);
[03:29:52] <hanzo2001> This is not a question, just informative! resolved strange behaviour! $(div).append(form-> throws TypeError ;; $(div)[0].appendChild(form[0]) -> works as intended ;; REASON: contained input element had attribute name "nodeName" and screwed up access to FORM.nodeName
[03:31:04] <Cork> hanzo2001: you mean you've added custom attributes to the element outside of data-?
[03:31:19] <Cork> or how would the nodeName be invalid?
[03:31:48] <hanzo2001> no. The html contained an <input> element with attribute name="nodeName"
[03:31:56] <Cork> ah
[03:32:00] <Cork> bad choice of name
[03:32:26] <hanzo2001> yes, this is bad practice I presume... all is corrected. thank you
[03:32:37] <hanzo2001> uhm, how do I quit?
[03:32:45] <Cork> /quit
[03:35:52] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks but when i use that , the iframe body is empty
[03:35:53] <krambiorix> :s
[03:36:21] <Cork> well that is another problem and not part of this
[03:37:45] <krambiorix> Cork, okay thanks!
[04:03:14] <Philip> Need some help
[04:03:15] <Philip> $scope.callflowJson[length].$scope.str1
[04:03:17] <Philip> after writing this its gives error $ is undefined
[04:03:31] <Philip> $scope is undefined
[04:03:38] <Cork> ?paste
[04:03:38] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:04:08] <Omar-> angularjs?
[04:04:13] <Philip> in jquery is there any way to add the $scope.str1 to $scope.callflowJson[length].
[04:04:21] <Philip> this is angular js code
[04:05:03] <Omar-> hmmm..angularjs has its own functions, similar to jquery ones
[04:05:31] <Omar-> maybe it's more feasible to use angularjs functions..
[04:05:40] <Omar-> IMHO
[04:05:54] <mooncup> if I pass the ajax function a multidimensional array, will it automatically convert it to a POST or GET array?
[04:06:30] <mooncup> for example will {id : [1,2,3] } => ?id[]=1&id[]=2&id[]=3
[04:06:50] <Omar-> !api serialize
[04:06:50] <b-ot> Omar-: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[04:06:55] <Cork> mooncup: yes
[04:07:22] <Omar-> Cork is it same as .serialize() ?
[04:07:34] <Cork> its the same as $.param
[04:07:36] <Omar-> or stringify()
[04:07:38] <Cork> ans .serialize uses that
[04:07:41] <Omar-> oh true param
[04:07:56] <Omar-> !api param
[04:07:57] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[04:08:01] <Omar-> !api $.param
[04:08:02] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[04:08:07] <mooncup> excellent. thanks Cork
[04:08:13] <Cork> data: $.param({id : [1,2,3] }) is identical to data; {id : [1,2,3] }
[04:08:19] <Cork> * data: {id : [1,2,3] }
[04:09:10] <Cork> mooncup: if you want to know what $.ajax will do just do console.log($.param(data))
[04:09:27] <Cork> unless what you have is a formData object that is :)
[04:11:15] <mooncup> ah that's vcery handy
[04:11:17] <mooncup> thanks
[04:19:10] <mooncup> hm it seems to be encoding it weirdly
[04:28:52] <paul_true> hi helpful helper, i got two short questions. how do i remove only leading whitespaces from a string? and is there a way to ingore case when using the .replace()- method?
[04:30:19] <Inspiral> hey guys, can anyone explain why this isn't working: http://jsfiddle.net/rcu6xjpc/ ?
[04:31:38] <Uhkis> Inspiral: how is it not working?
[04:31:57] <Inspiral> the <dt> tags are not having display: none applied to them
[04:32:26] <Uhkis> it works fine here
[04:32:32] <bacobart> works for me too
[04:32:53] <MeiR-> Inspiral - works for me
[04:32:58] <Inspiral> hmm, i had a domain blocked - sorry :s
[04:34:06] <MeiR-> Inspiral: jquery.com was blocked?
[04:34:27] <Inspiral> i have a script blocker, things are blocked by default, i didnt notice
[04:36:38] <MeiR-> paul_true : for both of your questions, i think you better use regex
[04:38:37] <MeiR-> i can help if you provide your current code
[04:40:11] <esko> hi guys! never touched jquery (sort of), was doing some web development in late 90s and early 2k, now all over sudden im supposed to grab stuff of an api and format and so forth, looking forward to embark on my journey :-)
[04:40:51] <jakery> welcome to the world of tomorrow!
[04:41:26] <esko> very much so jakery. css3, html5 wow :), and jquery and whatnot libs.
[04:41:28] <MeiR-> esko, actually, jquery has very friednly and clear tutorials
[04:41:40] <MeiR-> with plenty of examples and source codes
[04:41:46] <paul_true> @MeiR already solved with the help of @jakery but thanks ;)
[04:42:11] <MeiR-> oh ok, good to know
[04:42:20] <Uhkis> damn twitter ruined irc
[04:42:24] <Cork> jakery: if you like what you see with jquery you should see what is comming in the latest js standard
[04:42:38] <jakery> compared to what it used to be... developing for the web is like going to disneyworld when it used to be like washing angry chickens in an abandoned barn
[04:42:41] <Cork> it implements most of what jquery contains nativly in the language
[04:42:42] <MeiR-> Uhkis: twitter, then facebook, then whatsapp
[04:43:01] <mooncup> Cork: that's sweet
[04:43:08] <Cork> it uses different names though
[04:43:10] <Uhkis> MeiR-: it was twitter who started that annoying @nick trend
[04:43:22] <mooncup> however we'll have to keep using jquery for at least another 10 years for compatability :<
[04:43:24] <MeiR-> oh you mean the "at" sign
[04:43:26] <MeiR-> :)
[04:43:28] <jakery> eh as soon as I found out about document.querySelectorAll I kinda just stopped using jquery xD
[04:43:54] <Uhkis> mooncup: you mean we get to use jquery.. :)
[04:43:57] <Cork> jakery: its what jquery has used for ever
[04:44:04] <MeiR-> thought you refer to the activity decrease on irc
[04:44:05] <Omar-> Uhkis it was common on irc back in 90's
[04:44:17] <Omar-> i mean @nickname
[04:44:20] <Cork> the main reason for jquery was to add a compatibility layer for ies querky document.all and so on
[04:44:45] <Cork> not to forget the .attachEvent -_-'
[04:44:50] <Uhkis> Omar-: i can't recall anyone using that, unless newb talking to an op and thinking its part of their nick
[04:44:53] <Cork> *yuck*
[04:44:58] <mooncup> 13:43 < Uhkis> mooncup: you mean we get to use jquery.. :)
[04:45:06] <jakery> thankfully i develop internal apps for a linux workshop! they only care about FF also, but I test all my stuff on chrome because I likes it better
[04:45:14] <mooncup> I love jquery, however it would be nicer for it to be native in all browsers :P
[04:45:18] <Omar-> Uhkis haha, true
[04:45:21] <Cork> jakery: wow, that is rare
[04:45:45] <Cork> jakery: linux only is fine, but most neardy places like that tend to adore google
[04:45:55] <Cork> (it sure is here)
[04:46:09] <MeiR-> Cork, who works on js standard anyway?
[04:46:18] <FinStick> what does linux have in common with google?
[04:46:20] <MeiR-> [too lazy to google]
[04:46:41] <Cork> MeiR-: you want names or what?
[04:46:46] <MeiR-> no
[04:46:47] <Cork> js standard is the ecmascript
[04:46:47] <Uhkis> "they made android" i guess
[04:47:11] <Cork> Uhkis: computer geeks tend to like google
[04:47:14] <jakery> welp most of them develop for custom hw/kernel that has a fucked up version control, combined with a stupid internal package manager that requires all of the desktops to use openSuSe 11.
[04:47:22] <Cork> and most linux users tend to be computer geeks
[04:47:33] <FinStick> so google made android. but what has android got to do with linux?
[04:47:38] <Cork> i stick out like a sore thumb there though
[04:47:43] <jakery> android is a linux distro
[04:47:46] <Uhkis> Cork: well the search engine part is awesome
[04:47:47] <Cork> no
[04:47:57] <Cork> android is a completely different beast
[04:48:11] <Cork> the only thing it has incommon with linux is the kernel
[04:48:18] <Cork> everything else is separate
[04:48:23] <jakery> then how can I get a bash (albiet gimped) prompt on my phone
[04:48:42] <Uhkis> there's bash for android?
[04:48:50] <Cork> cause you can go below android and run it directly ontop of the kernel
[04:48:58] <jakery> yeah but if you're not rooted good luck doing anything
[04:49:00] <Cork> and then you have a android app that can show the content
[04:49:04] <Cork> (of bash)
[04:49:18] <FinStick> <Cork> jakery: linux only is fine, but most neardy places like that tend to adore google
[04:49:23] <Cork> Uhkis: you don't have bash for android you have a terminal
[04:49:33] <Cork> the terminal then just runs the linux process
[04:49:35] <FinStick> that's why I asked my original question
[04:49:45] <Uhkis> Cork: that was my point ;)
[04:50:00] <jakery> well every engineer here is either running linux or mac, neither of which like to be sullied by IE
[04:50:11] <Cork> lol
[04:50:37] <jakery> at least not since like ox 10.1 for mac or something like that
[04:50:42] <jakery> back when I was.. 11 or something
[04:50:53] <Uhkis> those were the days
[04:50:55] <Cork> i'm ok with supporting ie10+
[04:51:00] <Cork> but not older
[04:51:19] <Cork> hack i have more problems with webkit bugs then ie11...
[04:51:34] <jakery> im gunna be honest, I dont have any fallbacks for `display: flex;`
[04:51:51] <Cork> ouch
[04:51:57] <Cork> not even display: flexbox; ?
[04:52:09] <jakery> nope
[04:52:14] <jakery> no vendor prefixes either
[04:52:21] <Cork> wow...
[04:52:38] <Cork> that really limits what browser you can support :)
[04:52:44] <Cork> as webkit still love prefixes
[04:53:04] <FinStick> Cork: you a geek?
[04:53:07] <is_actually_diab> doesnt need em though, unless you're in gradient rendering
[04:53:08] <is_actually_diab> brb
[04:53:13] <FinStick> Cork: you a linux or google?
[04:53:21] <Cork> linux -google
[04:53:32] <Cork> i stay away from google as much as i possibly can
[04:53:40] <Cork> and has for years
[04:53:53] <Uhkis> why?
[04:54:21] <Cork> they creaped me out me out back in ~2006
[04:54:23] <FinStick> He think it's cool
[04:54:37] <FinStick> what happened in 2006
[04:54:38] <Cork> and is getting worse and worse with how they try to track ppl
[04:54:44] <Uhkis> Cork: when they announced their upcoming browser? :D
[04:54:50] <MeiR-> try and succeed...
[04:54:58] <MeiR-> but you can't avoid them
[04:55:02] <Cork> no before they announced anything
[04:55:09] <Cork> and was basically only google.com + gmail.com
[04:55:14] <MeiR-> if you use web, u definately use google
[04:55:32] <Cork> but when they started to talk about "personal web experience"
[04:55:33] <FinStick> cmon you must use the google search engine
[04:55:46] <Cork> meaning "we know who you are so we can find your interests"
[04:55:53] <Cork> THAT creeped me out like mad
[04:56:08] <MeiR-> FinStick probably he does that without being logged in to any google account
[04:56:14] <Cork> i switched to scroogle.com about then :)
[04:56:22] <Cork> and haven't use google much at all since
[04:56:39] <Cork> FinStick: no, cause they still track you
[04:56:52] <MeiR-> google have really nice tools
[04:56:59] <Cork> by fingerprinting you based on ip, ua, cookies and so on
[04:56:59] <MeiR-> Drive and Maps and Sheets etc.
[04:57:12] <MeiR-> Gmail is a wonderful web mail client
[04:57:20] <MeiR-> sorry, cross-platform*
[04:57:26] <Cork> ya, and it lets google read all your mail...
[04:57:37] <Cork> or "index it for adventicement"
[04:57:39] <MeiR-> they are dominate the web
[04:57:43] <MeiR-> so i don't care anymore
[04:58:52] <MeiR-> the main use of their "personalisation" is for targeting ads
[04:59:15] <MeiR-> and you know what? if i see ads anyway, i prefer to see the ones that can relate to me
[04:59:36] <MeiR-> besides, we all turned into banner blinds anyway
[04:59:43] <FinStick> How long does it take for one person (1 day a week) to make a site like facebook? estimates anyone?
[04:59:44] <Uhkis> nowadays the personalization actually modifies your search results
[05:00:10] <MeiR-> FinStick: 1 day a week?
[05:00:15] <FinStick> yes
[05:00:17] <Uhkis> FinStick: lifetime
[05:00:24] <MeiR-> he'll die before
[05:00:30] <FinStick> cmon now
[05:00:58] <MeiR-> seriously.
[05:01:23] <FinStick> your overestimating facebook
[05:01:24] <DRSK> 18.9 years to be exact
[05:01:36] <Uhkis> FinStick: no, you're seriously underestimating it
[05:01:39] <MeiR-> i don't overestimate
[05:01:39] <FinStick> DRSK lol!
[05:01:50] <MeiR-> they currently have very large teams, that's a fact
[05:02:02] <FinStick> I started out as one guy!
[05:02:04] <FinStick> *it
[05:02:19] <MeiR-> it didn't have all these features
[05:02:37] <MeiR-> and this one guy worked for months or years, by daily manner
[05:02:39] <DRSK> My guesstimate anyway ;p 1 day a week is 12 hours thats roughly 650 or so each year and seeing as it might be well over 13k hours needed well there you have it ~20yrs. Better get crackin!
[05:03:02] <FinStick> MeiR-: nah, he worked on it for about 3 months
[05:03:25] <MeiR-> ok, but you're talking about the first release of facebook
[05:03:26] <Uhkis> FinStick: but it was mainly a static forum at that time
[05:03:40] <MeiR-> i think i didn't even have private messaging
[05:04:06] <FinStick> OK, How long to make a porno website then 1 day a week still?
[05:04:18] <Omar-> 5 mins
[05:04:25] <Uhkis> define porn website
[05:04:34] <MeiR-> with user uploaded videos, or me filming? :)
[05:04:36] <Uhkis> single <img> tag isn't that hard to type :D
[05:04:53] <Omar-> iframes and link other porno sites
[05:04:56] <FinStick> lol MeiR-
[05:05:13] <FinStick> more the user filming and uploading.
[05:05:26] <MeiR-> one day if you're professional
[05:05:40] <FinStick> wow thats easy
[05:05:49] <MeiR-> what's your point? :)
[05:05:53] <Uhkis> and if you use a cms, it's about an hour or so
[05:05:53] <MeiR-> will u tell us?
[05:05:56] <FinStick> 1 day for porno site but 20 years for facebook
[05:06:02] <Cr0vaX> hi there, if I click plus button I want the fields to appear right under the "original" ones, anyone can help? http://jsfiddle.net/3ze6f4ct/8/
[05:06:12] <MeiR-> you said 1 day a week
[05:06:22] <Uhkis> FinStick: that's why theres million of porn sites and only one facebook :D
[05:06:27] <MeiR-> lol
[05:06:29] <Uhkis> millions*
[05:06:50] <FinStick> Uhkis: not quite. There are others like twitter and such.
[05:06:54] <MeiR-> perhaps we really over estimated facebook
[05:07:13] <FinStick> I think so
[05:07:33] <MeiR-> after all, it's all based on different variations of a profile page
[05:07:36] <MeiR-> posts and photos
[05:07:37] <Omar-> Cr0vaX you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/3ze6f4ct/9/?
[05:07:41] <Uhkis> FinStick: but twitter isn't anything like facebook
[05:08:30] <FinStick> nah, same idea; different flavour.
[05:08:30] <MeiR-> Uhkis, FB looks big because of the user amount and application amount
[05:08:44] <Cr0vaX> Omar-: no If you click Plus button, new fields will appear, but not aligned horizontally with the original ones
[05:09:06] <MeiR-> but actually, you should implement registraion, login, posting, messaging, settings, and groups
[05:09:12] <Uhkis> MeiR-: and stuff like xhprof, chat, user tracking, apis, etc, etc
[05:09:14] <MeiR-> and advertising if you wish
[05:09:39] <MeiR-> well, i'm still not sure to what fb version FinStick meant
[05:09:53] <FinStick> porno fb
[05:09:58] <MeiR-> but no doubt that the first release was basic
[05:10:22] <MeiR-> there is already some porno fb site
[05:10:38] <MeiR-> sex fb to me more precise
[05:10:41] <FinStick> ok then a free prono fb site
[05:10:57] <Uhkis> FinStick: https://www.drupal.org/project/commons there, 5mins :D
[05:11:02] <MeiR-> u mean meeting girls and guys for a night?
[05:11:27] <MeiR-> btw, it's comepletely off-topic in #jquery, is this okay? :D
[05:11:32] <MeiR-> i'm quite new to this channel
[05:11:51] <MeiR-> i don't see any link to rules url in topic
[05:11:54] <FinStick> i dont use drupal
[05:12:16] <Uhkis> MeiR-: there's a lot of off-topic chitchat usually
[05:12:17] <FinStick> ill use jquery to implement to make it on topic :)
[05:12:35] <MeiR-> lol
[05:12:48] <Uhkis> FinStick: you think drupal doesn't use jquery?
[05:13:04] <Omar-> Cr0vaX this? http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/3ze6f4ct/10/
[05:13:06] <FinStick> i just dont use drupal
[05:13:09] <MeiR-> $("<img src='girl.jpg'>").naked();
[05:13:09] <FinStick> i use wordpress
[05:14:02] <FinStick> cool
[05:14:24] <FinStick> anyway, a porno fb site sounds fantastic.
[05:14:42] <FinStick> please don't copy my idea.
[05:14:47] <MeiR-> what's so wrong about redtube?
[05:14:51] <mooncup> awesome my new code is so fast it broke our reporting
[05:15:01] <Uhkis> already copied and implemented, i'm getting rich!
[05:15:26] <FinStick> MeiR-: nothing wrong with redtube other than I dont own it.
[05:15:46] <MeiR-> well, big ones always will beat you
[05:16:32] <FinStick> MeiR-: well that just sucks a big hairy one
[05:18:10] <Omar-> Cr0vaX use .closest(selector) better than .parent().parent().parent().parent()
[05:19:37] <FinStick> ?closest
[05:19:46] <FinStick> .closest
[05:19:53] <FinStick> >closest
[05:19:59] <FinStick> is there a bot here
[05:25:44] <MeiR-> !api closest
[05:25:44] <b-ot> MeiR-: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[05:27:26] <TuomasL> I'm animating numbers and found a nice plugin. Problem is my number is 22 digits long so the result is e.g. 4E21... any clue if I can get around that?
[05:27:34] <TuomasL> Plugin being: https://github.com/aishek/jquery-animateNumber
[05:28:25] <Cork> TuomasL: could you try making a demo in jsfiddle?
[05:28:39] <TuomasL> I am :) Just realized might be useful.
[05:28:57] <Cork> i think i know what is going on, and might be hard to do much about
[05:29:04] <Cork> but i want to be sure before saying it
[05:29:51] <TuomasL> just a moment
[05:37:30] <TuomasL> Cork you can see here, I start the actual thing on line 167, but the plugin is before that unminified so you can see. http://jsfiddle.net/sj48wb4f/1/
[05:38:56] <Cork> hmm
[05:39:01] <Cork> ya, was afraid of that
[05:39:08] <TuomasL> I want to actually see the zeroes.
[05:39:23] <Cork> console.log(3000000000000000000000)
[05:39:25] <Cork> 3e+21
[05:39:29] <Cork> this is what bites you
[05:39:29] <TuomasL> mm
[05:39:36] <TuomasL> indeed.
[05:39:47] <Cork> javascript arithmetic is 32bit
[05:41:12] <callumacrae> Heya! I need promises help. Basically I want the .fail() function at the bottom to be called when the $.getJson request returns a 404; currently it dies silently. How can I do this?
[05:41:16] <callumacrae> https://gist.github.com/callumacrae/3c5e2d842048f2920561
[05:41:43] <Cork> so the plugin would have to be modified to split the values into separate number (or to use a string) to get around this problem
[05:42:53] <Cork> callumacrae: why are you using .then instead of .done?
[05:42:53] <TuomasL> Yeah. I am animating lots of numbers, that's the only really large one. Others are fine. Perhaps in this number's case we'll skip the animation. Perhaps create it using another method.
[05:43:30] <Cork> TuomasL: you could strip out the first number and just tick it down manually
[05:43:36] <Cork> and just animate the rest
[05:43:44] <callumacrae> Cork: Not sure
[05:43:51] <Omar-> maybe statusCode: { 400: function () { $.getJson } }
[05:44:16] <Cork> that isn't what the code does
[05:44:34] <TuomasL> Cork, or remove the last number and add it at the end. It's basically for show anyway
[05:44:47] <callumacrae> Cork: I'm using .then() because the result is changing every time
[05:44:50] <TuomasL> Not sure people who aren't looking will notice.
[05:45:37] <Cork> TuomasL: .then(func1, func2) == .done(func1).fail(func2)
[05:45:52] <Cork> but you only give it the done handler so i don't see the point
[05:46:25] <callumacrae> Think you meant to highlight me there
[05:46:28] <callumacrae> Oh you mean on line 10?
[05:46:33] <Cork> lol
[05:46:36] <Cork> ouch ya, sorry
[05:46:52] <Cork> callumacrae: line 3, 4, 5 and 10
[05:47:10] <Cork> you use .then() as .done()
[05:47:12] <callumacrae> lines 3, 4 and 5 return something different, using .done() wouldn't work
[05:47:22] <callumacrae> No I don't, .then() and .done() behave differently
[05:47:27] <Cork> ah
[05:47:44] <callumacrae> `promise` returns 123
[05:47:44] <Cork> well then you can't do much
[05:47:57] <Cork> as you replace the return value
[05:48:01] <callumacrae> promise.then(function(){return 456}).then(function(x){x==456})
[05:48:07] <callumacrae> with .done() x would equal 123
[05:48:29] <Omar-> TuomasL http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/2xgczw91/ just a hint for splitting/joining large numbers
[05:48:35] <Cork> promise.then(); promise.fail();
[05:48:39] <Cork> the best you can do
[05:48:53] <Cork> as long as none of the .then in the something function replaces the promise
[05:49:06] <Cork> cause then you don't have access to it at all
[05:49:08] <callumacrae> I guess I need to do this then? https://gist.github.com/callumacrae/3c5e2d842048f2920561
[05:49:29] <callumacrae> oh, and return `promise` instead of the $.getJson promise
[05:49:30] <Cork> you should start by stating what you're trying to do
[05:49:48] <Cork> instead of something ins't doing what i want
[05:49:56] <callumacrae> I did. When the .getJson request fails it throws an error
[05:50:00] <Cork> no
[05:50:13] <Cork> why is the .then functions replacing the return values?
[05:50:13] <callumacrae> And I want to catch that error
[05:50:46] <callumacrae> https://github.com/Lostmyname/monkey/blob/master/js/monkey.js#L35
[05:50:50] <Cork> as i suspect what you want is most likely return $.when($.getJSON(), $.getJSON(),$.getJSON())
[05:50:52] <callumacrae> For readability, mostly
[05:50:52] <Cork> or something like that
[05:51:13] <Cork> ah
[05:51:23] <Cork> then ya, use a separate deferred
[05:51:24] <callumacrae> It's a pretty massive library :p
[05:51:35] <callumacrae> Alright, I'll try that :) thanks
[05:51:44] <Cork> or possibly a separate $.Callbacks
[05:51:50] <Cork> you can attach it to the original deferred
[05:52:30] <callumacrae> Or I could wrap the entire thing in a try-catch, but that doesn't seem very nice
[05:53:23] <callumacrae> TIL $.Callbacks exists. Never heard of that before
[05:55:16] <eilgin> hi gals
[05:55:28] <callumacrae> o\/
[05:55:30] <callumacrae> \o/*
[06:01:36] <callumacrae> wat
[06:01:47] <callumacrae> does $.getJSON not let me use .fail?
[06:01:54] <callumacrae> Seems to throw the error and not call the handler
[06:03:32] <Cork> ah, wait
[06:03:36] <Cork> are you doing jsonp?
[06:03:44] <callumacrae> yep
[06:03:54] <Cork> <script> doesn't trigger fail no
[06:04:01] <Cork> so ya, that is the cause
[06:04:08] <callumacrae> oh right, of course
[06:04:31] <callumacrae> Any way I can work around that?
[06:06:33] <Cork> don't use jsonp
[06:06:39] <Cork> or don't relay on 404
[06:06:54] <Cork> alternatively you can jump to jquery-2.x
[06:07:00] <Cork> and drop support for ie
[06:07:07] <Cork> jsonp fires .fail there
[06:07:16] <Cork> (older ie doesn't support onerror on <script> tags)
[06:07:25] <callumacrae> have to support IE8, that's why we're using jsonp in the first place :(
[06:07:34] <Cork> then you're kinda out of luck
[06:07:54] <Cork> you could proxy the json call over you're own server so you don't have to use jsonp
[06:07:54] <callumacrae> I'll just get them to stop firing 404s
[06:08:01] <callumacrae> It's an API that get data for a given name
[06:08:08] <callumacrae> When the name is invalid, it throws a 404
[06:08:30] <callumacrae> I'm writing code that will be used on other peoples websites at some point
[06:10:02] <Cork> ah
[06:10:10] <Cork> ya, 404 in a jsonp api is bad design
[06:10:22] <Cork> it is common for restful json apis though
[06:10:34] <Cork> but should be avoided for jsonp
[06:17:18] <eilgin> i need your expertise on dom range : this fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/cyj8d1sj/1/embedded/result/) works on ie 8 but the function inside it (insertAtCaret) doesn't work in my app. Something must have happened that modified document.selection (because the caret position is set to 0) but how can i know that ? i already trapped "onselectionchange" but it doesn't help...any ideas ?
[06:33:11] <eilgin> what do you do when you want to resolve dom range issue (specifically on ie 8) ?
[06:33:41] <bacobart> cry
[06:33:54] <eilgin> after that ?
[06:34:34] <BillCriswell> eilgin: Crying is usually my final step so go home.
[06:34:58] <BillCriswell> eilgin: Honestly I'm not sure what a DOM range issue. I'll google haha.
[06:35:33] <BillCriswell> eilgin: Ah, I see now.
[06:38:18] <BillCriswell> eilgin: I assume you tried this, but any luck with this? http://stackoverflow.com/a/169873/191226

[07:10:31] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm using $.when for the first time and I'm curious as to why the data value in line 39 returns as undefined. It's set in the $.ajax success function on line 57. I think I'm misunderstanding when $.when executes it's functions or something. Any help is appreciated!      https://pastee.org/9pczm
[07:18:07] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: seems like you're calling $.when on 2 variables that aren't defined yet. also, if you're gonna read it with .data() then you should also write it with .data()
[07:18:31] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Oh damn I didn't think of that. Let me do that
[07:19:15] <BillCriswell> Damn, shoky beat me to it.
[07:19:23] <BillCriswell> Shocking.
[07:19:30] <shoky> ;p
[07:34:57] <GregRH> anyone know how to trigger an event when a page is loaded from the back/forward cache? i.e. when using the browser navigation to get to the page
[07:42:02] <DeltaHeavy> I still can't get my $.when to work. Anybody know why? Neither the always, fail, or done function execute - https://pastee.org/6aem5
[07:43:50] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Try putting your $.when shit at the bottom.
[07:44:04] <BillCriswell> Oh wait no.
[07:44:33] <GregRH> anyone know how to trigger an event when a page is loaded from the back/forward cache? i.e. when using the browser navigation to get to the page
[07:44:56] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Let me try to set up a simplified example right quick.
[07:45:09] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks!
[07:47:23] <pentagrass> Is there a way to know what a file is named on the local machine once it is selected for upload?
[07:48:26] <dglambert> https://gist.github.com/dglambert/451121bfb25eb9fb96af
[07:49:06] <dglambert> So i have this ajax call and I want to access my JSON in my complete instead of my success and I am getting an exception now saying result.DATA is undefiened
[07:49:25] <dglambert> it works fine in success
[07:51:01] <dglambert> any obvious reasons why I cant access result the same way
[07:58:30] <BillCriswell> dglambert: The callback for complete isn't the same as success.
[07:59:09] <BillCriswell> success is function (data, status, xhr) and complete is function ( xhr, textStatus)
[07:59:43] <dglambert> ah ok
[07:59:46] <dglambert> thanks
[08:00:11] <BillCriswell> dglambert: Should be using .done() and .always()
[08:00:25] <dglambert> yeah I saw that too
[08:00:27] <BillCriswell> which is consistent.
[08:00:31] <BillCriswell> dglambert: Sweeeeet
[08:00:38] <dglambert> same arguments?
[08:00:42] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:01:30] <cariveri> Hi. how do I select an element by id and his number? like id="chair_5"
[08:01:31] <BillCriswell> function ( data || xhr, textStatus, xhr || error ) essentially
[08:01:43] <BillCriswell> cariveri: $('#chair_5')
[08:04:25] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: again, you're calling $.when passing it 2 undefined variables (hasProductDescription and hasMagnified). they're only assigned later on..
[08:05:01] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: I'm assigning them at the very top now on line 11 - https://pastee.org/kp2n7
[08:05:13] <cariveri> BillCriswell: oh I mean when the nubmer is not known. I want to selet a div which is the next after the clicked element. and the target looks like id="chaire_NUM". I dotn care for the number.
[08:05:53] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: oh. but 1) you're assigning both to the same $.Deferred().  2) you're RE-assigning them later on to new $.Deferred's
[08:05:59] <cariveri> BillCriswell: I expected somethin like    clicked.clostest('#chair_[*]');
[08:06:03] <DeltaHeavy> OH damn
[08:06:04] <DeltaHeavy> I'm dumb
[08:06:05] <DeltaHeavy> lol
[08:06:33] <BillCriswell> cariveri: You can do .closest('div[id^=chair_]')
[08:07:13] <DeltaHeavy> IT WORKS!
[08:07:23] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks shoky + BillCriswell
[08:07:31] <shoky> yey
[08:08:48] <BillCriswell> Wooo
[08:10:35] <cariveri> BillCriswell: I got : $(this).closest('div[id^=grid_row_w]').find('.content_area'); and it wont work.
[08:10:56] <BillCriswell> cariveri: Is it a div?
[08:11:11] <cariveri> BillCriswell: yes it is a div. grid_row_ without w at the end.
[08:11:33] <BillCriswell> Are you sure `this` is what you think it is?
[08:12:16] <GregRH> anyone know how to trigger an event when a page is loaded from the back/forward cache? i.e. when using the browser navigation to get to the page
[08:13:27] <cariveri> BillCriswell: I jsut checked, it is correctly the clickable element.
[08:13:49] <R13ose> On this site: http://ecosanity.org how do I stop the background images from cycling when I hover over the thumbnails and back out?
[08:14:36] <cariveri> BillCriswell: where should I paste you a sample ?
[08:14:45] <BillCriswell> cariveri: Making one now to make sure I'm not nuts.
[08:16:30] <BillCriswell> cariveri: http://jsbin.com/tinuwipawe/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:16:44] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/tinuwipawe/2/edit *
[08:18:25] <BillCriswell> cariveri: Are you sure you're understanding .closest() ?
[08:18:59] <BillCriswell> It goes through the nodes ancestors.
[08:20:06] <mikecmpbll> what's the deal with jquery file uploads? I've read a bunch but every single article seems to say something different
[08:20:15] <mikecmpbll> can you upload a file with $.ajax() ?
[08:20:47] <cariveri> BillCriswell: yes . the clickable elem is inside a table and outside of the table the next div is what is wanted. so thats why I tried closest.
[08:21:02] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Sorry, ended up in a meeting for a bit of that time. http://jsbin.com/reserutixi/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:22:06] <BillCriswell> cariveri: So like.. <table id="chair_5"><tr><td><clickedthing></td></tr></table><div>I want this</div> ?
[08:23:05] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: No problem, got it all fixed up anyway.
[08:23:10] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Sweet.
[08:27:14] <R13ose> Any thoughts on my question?
[08:29:05] <cariveri> BillCriswell: yes. thats about it. I took the wron id, but that does not change anything: $(this).closest('div[id^=content_area_]').find('.content_area');  with markup: table(clickable) then div id ="content_area_5" class=content_area
[08:30:41] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Is the .content_area div you're looking for INSIDE of #content_area_whatever?
[08:31:30] <BillCriswell> Er, cariveri ^^
[08:31:47] <R13ose> oh :P
[08:32:08] <BillCriswell> R13ose: What plugin are you using to accomplish that?
[08:32:21] <R13ose> BillCriswell: cycle
[08:33:34] <BillCriswell> You can do $('#whatever-element-the-slider-is').cycle('stop') on mouseenter of a pager thingie.
[08:33:35] <cariveri> BillCriswell: no actually the div with id content_area_NUM has also the class content_area
[08:34:20] <BillCriswell> cariveri: Ok.. so .closest('content_area') should be enough?
[08:34:24] <cariveri> BillCriswell: where do you save what I edited? I have put the markup into your paste.
[08:34:41] <BillCriswell> cariveri: It should have given you a new url.
[08:35:39] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Something like $('.pager').one('mouseenter', function () { $('#whatever-element-the-slider-is').cycle('stop'); });
[08:36:35] <R13ose> BillCriswell: would you be able to look at the code within slideshow.js and see what I am doing wrong?
[08:37:25] <cariveri> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/topukokaga/2/edit
[08:38:56] <cariveri> BillCriswell: can you see that X is supposed to trigger content_area_2 to show up ?
[08:40:17] <cariveri> BillCriswell: its jsut the markup so far of course.
[08:40:42] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Do you want to stop the advancing completely after a single hover or do you want it to keep going after you hover out?
[08:41:40] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I want to stop the cycling altogether at any point.
[08:41:59] <BillCriswell> cariveri: How are you associating X to content_area_2 ?
[08:42:07] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Oh.
[08:44:24] <cariveri> BillCriswell: not at al yet. but Im intending to extract X from the trigger's id and make a 2 from it or so. in any case the next div after the table should be selected at least.
[08:44:49] <BillCriswell> There's two divs after the same table.
[08:45:35] <cariveri> BillCriswell: yes. so Y will is meant to trigger area_1 . I could rename it to content_area_Y  .
[08:47:04] <cariveri> BillCriswell:  I thought closest would fidn the next one and I would then do something with it.
[08:47:26] <robertmaxrees> cariveri .closest() goes up through parent nodes.
[08:47:45] <BillCriswell> .closest() would get you out of the table then you'd use .nextAll or .next to get the things after the table.
[08:47:47] <robertmaxrees> starting with the element itself.
[08:48:28] <BillCriswell> R13ose: http://jsfiddle.net/v6mwdhc3/ so somehting like this esssentially?
[08:48:41] <BillCriswell> Haha sounds like a snake said that.
[08:50:12] <R13ose> BillCriswell:  I believe so but I am not sure why my code is not working like that.
[08:53:33] <BillCriswell> R13ose: What's with the $('.slidenav') mouseleave?
[08:53:34] <cleopatra> hey
[08:53:38] <cleopatra>  some there
[08:53:41] <cleopatra> xD
[08:53:47] <cleopatra> happy new year :O
[08:54:20] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I think that was to make the text above the thumbnails, the text of the current background image.
[08:56:44] <cariveri> BillCriswell: ok. I went the easy road:  var $target = $(this).closest('table').next('div');
[08:57:17] <BillCriswell> R13ose: I think you can change that .hover to be .mouseenter
[08:57:34] <BillCriswell> If you do .hover() with one function you're doing the same function on mouseenter and mouseleave I believe.
[08:57:51] <robertmaxrees> yep
[08:57:53] <R13ose> BillCriswell: trying
[08:57:58] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/hover/#hover-handlerInOut
[08:58:14] <BillCriswell> cariveri: That doesn't help you get to the second one though.
[08:59:15] <BillCriswell> cariveri: It seems like you essentially want tabs.
[08:59:55] <cariveri> BillCriswell: yes somehow.
[09:00:15] <R13ose> BillCriswell: change this: $('.slidenav img') or something else?
[09:04:59] <BillCriswell> R13ose: http://pastie.org/pastes/9820481/text how close does this get you?
[09:06:02] <delboy1978uk> how to scroll to a certain #id?
[09:06:26] <BillCriswell> cariveri: http://jsbin.com/fidefuzese/1/edit?html,js,output are you shooting for something like this?
[09:06:51] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: $('#id').offset().top and .animate() scrollTop on html and body.
[09:07:05] <robertmaxrees> only if you want it animated.
[09:07:22] <BillCriswell> Ah, true... kind of assumed there.
[09:07:32] <robertmaxrees> that's probably what they want anyway.
[09:07:37] <BillCriswell> location.hash = '#id'; will do that job haha
[09:07:46] <BillCriswell> I think?
[09:08:00] <robertmaxrees> location.hash = 'id';  iirc.
[09:08:46] <BillCriswell> I might even remember that being inconsistent between browsers.
[09:09:09] <BillCriswell> At least reading it, some would return #id where others just id.
[09:09:48] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah, return values vs. set values and all that.
[09:10:01] <BillCriswell> Bunch of bologna
[09:10:38] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Looks like it worked?
[09:11:08] <R13ose> BillCriswell: that gets me very close.  I kept $('.slides a').hover but if you want me to remove this I can.  The only other thing I would say that should be changed is when I mouse out of the thumbnails box, I should go back to the first image.
[09:12:11] <cariveri> BillCriswell: yes its nice. but $links and $div would be selecting to much from the whole page.
[09:12:27] <BillCriswell> cariveri: You can localize it more.
[09:13:20] <BillCriswell> cariveri: http://jsbin.com/fidefuzese/2/edit?html,js,output
[09:15:28] <delboy1978uk> BillCriswell: hi again and thanks for that, i can get location.hash working but probably not keying in your offset stuff correctly, can you elaborate a little?
[09:16:18] <BillCriswell> R13ose: You can do $('.thumbnail-box').on('mouseleave', function () { cycle.cycle(0); }); (Just remove .thumbnail-box with what you actually need.
[09:16:39] <R13ose> BillCriswell: okay
[09:16:53] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: http://css-tricks.com/examples/SmoothPageScroll/ would be way more helpful than me.
[09:17:08] <delboy1978uk> thanks
[09:21:20] <cariveri> BillCriswell: ok , I adapted it. worked. but the first page shouldnt be visible on default and the opening effect is rather boring. thought it is rocking fast!
[09:22:08] <cariveri> *though
[09:23:09] <R13ose> BillCriswell: thanks that worked but I revert to your last version as I need to ask the owner of the site  one thing.
[09:23:12] <BillCriswell> cariveri: remove the .eq(0).trigger('click') and add some animationy stuff.
[09:23:21] <BillCriswell> R13ose: No problem.
[09:23:27] <R13ose> BillCriswell++
[09:25:23] <cariveri> BillCriswell: ok. but how do I prevent the first tab to show by default? Im surpirsed it is there, because I $(.content_area).hide(); at the beginning
[09:25:55] <BillCriswell> cariveri: I just explained that.
[09:27:59] <R13ose> afk
[09:28:21] <dglambert> Hey BillCriswell I'm trying to implement the new always() syntax, not sure how I am supposed to pass the data to the always()
[09:28:38] <delboy1978uk> BillCriswell: thanks for that :-)
[09:28:43] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: No problem.
[09:36:17] <cariveri> BillCriswell: you explained about the animation. the first was shown because I made a mistake in placing the all.hide()
[09:36:41] <cariveri> BillCriswell: but  anyway, I think I get going from here. thnak you very much
[09:38:53] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:39:04] <BillCriswell> dglambert: I'd have to read up on that a bit.
[09:39:23] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: tumaru is spamming.
[09:39:37] <robertmaxrees> gracias.  one sec.
[09:42:32] <robertmaxrees> lemme know if they bug you again.
[09:42:37] <BillCriswell> Will do.
[09:42:37] <robertmaxrees> dglambert what's your question?
[09:55:37] <dglambert> BillCriswell, I got it
[09:55:57] <dglambert> I wasn't sure on what the data: syntax was in the ajax call, I realized thats just the alias
[09:56:21] <_DB> sup guys I have a ajax request and it returns  this along with other data  [{exhibit_id: 16, exhibit_type_id: 0, exhibit_name: "Senri", exhibit_address: "Senri Towers",…}]
[09:56:48] <_DB> how can I run a foreach and print out the exhibit_id  of each exhibit?
[09:57:09] <_DB> would i do data.exhibits.each(){function }
[09:57:10] <dglambert> or maybe not
[09:57:43] <robertmaxrees> data.forEach(function() { console.log(this.exhibit_id) })
[09:58:08] <_DB> data.exhibits.forEach?
[09:58:29] <robertmaxrees> _DB where that data is stored, yeah.
[09:58:32] <_DB> ok
[09:58:34] <_DB> thansk bro!
[09:58:37] <robertmaxrees> no clue what you're passing to that callback.
[09:59:51] <_DB> its game data lol
[10:00:06] <_DB> creating a DB structure for a game
[10:00:08] <robertmaxrees> right, but i don't know the exact structure and all that.
[10:00:27] <_DB> i hear ya
[10:07:16] <_DB> robertmaxrees hmm seems i got a error  i got undefines
[10:07:19] <_DB> d*
[10:07:25] <robertmaxrees> show me your data then.
[10:07:26] <Omar-> goodnight everyone!
[10:07:43] <_DB> the data im returning is data.exhibits[] <-- a array
[10:07:51] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ _DB
[10:07:51] <b-ot> _DB: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:08:34] <_DB> I should paste the return of data.exhibits?
[10:08:41] <robertmaxrees> all of data
[10:08:45] <robertmaxrees> or an example of it.
[10:09:25] <_DB> how do I grab it I used console log but it has a bunch of extra things in it
[10:09:47] <robertmaxrees> console.log(JSON.stringify(data));
[10:13:10] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/ar7kfup5/
[10:14:10] <pentagrass> How do I make an option selected? I tried to do $("#myselect").val("0"); but that ends up setting all options to have a value of zero. I just want the option with the value of 0 to be selected. Any ideas?
[10:14:43] <cjohnson> you can set the select's val to the value of the option you want to select, I think
[10:14:49] <alexclark> is it possible to trigger a momentary hover of an element?
[10:14:50] <cjohnson> or set selected=true on the option itself
[10:15:14] <cjohnson> alexclark: you can .trigger('hover') and that will run any hover event listeners but it won't, for example, apply the css :hover style
[10:15:51] <_DB> "exhibits":[{"exhibit_id":1 ... more here ]}
[10:16:07] <devJunk> pentagrass: $("#myselect option[value=0]").prop("selected",true); where 0 is the value of the option you want to select
[10:16:17] <robertmaxrees> _DB one sec.
[10:16:26] <cjohnson> I think $('#myselect').val('0') would already do that devJunk
[10:16:29] <_DB> alright
[10:16:52] <alexclark> cjohnson: dang, thats what im trying to do. Is there anyway to hit that css state?
[10:17:00] <devJunk> cjohnson he said that it doesn't work and that it sets all options to 0 in his question
[10:17:20] <pentagrass> devJunk: I actually found a SO article.. I used the comment with 46 votes: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13343566/set-select-option-selected-by-value
[10:17:40] <cjohnson> devJunk: then he's doing something wrong, I think.  http://jsfiddle.net/a0j8b40b/
[10:17:43] <cjohnson> it works fine here
[10:17:52] <cjohnson> alexclark: move your mouse over it ;)
[10:18:00] <cjohnson> alexclark: you could, alternatively, use a class
[10:18:14] <robertmaxrees> _DB sorry my bad - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ar7kfup5/1/
[10:18:16] <cjohnson> .foo.hover, .foo:hover { your hover styles here }
[10:18:20] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach for reference
[10:18:24] <cjohnson> and then programmatically you can just addClass('hover')
[10:18:46] <robertmaxrees> _DB though be aware that [].forEach() doesn't exist in IE9 and below.
[10:18:53] <alexclark> cjohnson: and then set a timeout to remove it?
[10:19:00] <cjohnson> if that's what you want to do
[10:19:07] <_DB> oh really
[10:19:13] <_DB> crap
[10:19:18] <_DB> might cause problems
[10:19:23] <robertmaxrees> _DB yeah.  use a for loop in those cases.
[10:19:24] <cjohnson> _DB you can use es5shim
[10:19:48] <devJunk> cjohnson: you're right :)
[10:19:48] <robertmaxrees> if you have underscore or lodash already, those have functions available for this
[10:19:57] <robertmaxrees> jquery has a $.each();, though I tend to avoid it.
[10:20:16] <_DB> .each works on ie?
[10:20:23] <robertmaxrees> err...
[10:20:28] <robertmaxrees> $.each() from jquery does, yes.
[10:20:32] <robertmaxrees> because it's browser agnostic.
[10:20:45] <robertmaxrees> as long as you're in the 1.x series of JQ, that is
[10:21:05] <_DB> ok
[10:21:46] <_DB> would I be able to do a $.each of that data where would I put the variable name?
[10:21:56] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs ;)
[10:22:10] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[10:22:15] <_DB> thanks!
[10:24:23] <_DB> cool got it working thanks bro!
[10:26:05] <dandaman> I need a bit of help figuring out this super weird behavior with the left arrow on this image carousel which uses slick carousel. When you load the page and try to click the left arrow it doesn't work. Then mouse out of the arrow's area, mouse back in, it'll work. Then mouse out and mouse back in, it wont work… This doesn't happen with the right arrow, https://pax-dev.herokuapp.com/flights/show
[10:26:16] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[10:26:57] <robertmaxrees> dandaman can you create a reduced test case of your problem?/
[10:27:58] <dandaman> the page is built with partials, so i can easily separate the carousel from all the other parts
[10:28:11] <dandaman> it'll be a pita putting it up though :\
[10:28:27] <robertmaxrees> it's a bigger PITA trying to troubleshoot al;l your minified code ;)
[10:28:50] <robertmaxrees> but that kind of behavior means you're doing some kind of event binding within anbother event binding.
[10:29:32] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: I can gist my javascript file
[10:29:37] <robertmaxrees> at last, usually that's what it means.
[10:29:45] <robertmaxrees> eh, you can try to gist just the relevant bits.
[10:29:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to sift through everything tbh.
[10:30:08] <notchris> Hey everyone
[10:30:46] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: yep
[10:31:28] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/dsauerbrun/294ecb7531fb6dc3dcde
[10:32:31] <dandaman> the carouselListener isn't really relevant, but i figured i'd leave it in there in case you spot something I did not :\
[10:32:44] <dandaman> it's really just the carouselInitializer()
[10:32:53] <robertmaxrees> something else is going on here.
[10:33:22] <robertmaxrees> there's a mouseenter or similar event binding elsehwer.e
[10:33:38] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: that's why I'm here for help :( I'm not doing anything with that prevArrow
[10:33:49] <robertmaxrees> event bubbling is a real thing ;)
[10:33:50] <dandaman> just binding it to the slick carousel
[10:33:59] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: any tips for troubleshooting?
[10:34:08] <robertmaxrees> do a fiddle.
[10:34:13] <robertmaxrees> they're helpful for troubleshooting.
[10:34:17] <dandaman> a fiddle?
[10:34:24] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.net
[10:34:46] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, check all of your event bindings and make sure something isn't bubbling up and messing with you.
[10:36:53] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: jsfiddle seems like it'll be a pita to do, i'll start with event bindings. any good tool for that? There's the event listeners thing in chrome, is that pretty solid?
[10:37:01] <robertmaxrees> mostly.
[10:37:11] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[10:37:13] <robertmaxrees> read this, too.
[10:37:15] <Katharsis> how to open new tab with jquery but with old session?
[10:37:20] <robertmaxrees> Katharsis you can't.
[10:37:26] <Katharsis> why?
[10:37:43] <robertmaxrees> the browser dictates if a link opens as a new tab or window.
[10:37:46] <robertmaxrees> you can't hijack
[10:38:21] <Katharsis> robertmaxrees: what if I copy session keys form old to new tab?
[10:38:26] <Katharsis> with jquery-session
[10:38:30] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[10:38:30] <robertmaxrees> wat.
[10:38:39] <robertmaxrees> sessions aren't tab-centric the way you think they are.
[10:38:46] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue you're trying to solve?
[10:39:03] <Katharsis> ok, i will describe the problem
[10:39:08] <desophos> in jquery mobile forms, does the name attribute matter? it's the same as the id in some tutorials (http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/forms/) but different in others (http://api.jquerymobile.com/textinput/), and i can't find a mention of it
[10:39:46] <Katharsis> user clicked on button, then I send ajax to view which create object with url arg, the url arg is returen in JSON, then I use jquery to redirect user (new tab) on this url
[10:40:03] <robertmaxrees> Katharsis you can't force a "new tab"
[10:40:25] <Katharsis> ok, so what can I do now? i cannot set url to href
[10:40:27] <robertmaxrees> you can ask the browser to open the url in a new thing, but it decides if it's a tab or a window.
[10:40:53] <robertmaxrees> is this a URL on your site?
[10:41:10] <robertmaxrees> becuase you should change the way you're storing your session data on the client to persist
[10:41:20] <Katharsis> yes
[10:41:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then adjust your session management instead.
[10:43:16] <_DB> what does .append do?
[10:43:28] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery append
[10:43:29] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .append() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/append/
[10:43:35] <robertmaxrees> _DB ^
[10:43:47] <notchris> I have a script that is loaded on a calendar page that has some json in it
[10:43:48] <notchris> http://pastebin.com/MzqH9TC5
[10:43:49] <_DB> cool
[10:43:52] <_DB> thanlks
[10:44:03] <notchris> Do I need to separate the json from the script if I want to use that info elsewhere?
[10:44:12] <robertmaxrees> i would, yes.
[10:44:29] <notchris> @robertmaxrees Based on the script, it’s assigning the variable “events” to the json
[10:44:34] <robertmaxrees> also - since it's in a document ready, that info is scoped to that function - not accessible elsewhere.
[10:44:39] <notchris> How would I instead set “events” to the json file
[10:44:49] <robertmaxrees> generate both server-side instead.
[10:45:14] <notchris> So just load the script in my header?
[10:45:20] <notchris> So it’s loaded site-wide?
[10:45:25] <notchris> or footer
[10:45:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, without a document ready or anything.
[10:45:35] <robertmaxrees> totally depends on how you're loading your assets.
[10:45:44] <notchris> Throught functions.php (WP)
[10:45:47] <notchris> through*
[10:45:51] <robertmaxrees> no clue about that part.
[10:45:56] <notchris> Right, either way..
[10:46:03] <notchris> Once that json info is available site wide
[10:46:07] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: going the jsfiddle way :\
[10:46:12] <notchris> I can use it pretty easily?
[10:46:15] <robertmaxrees> notchris yes
[10:46:20] <robertmaxrees> notchris i might setup a global namespace to put these objects in, though.
[10:47:08] <notchris> @robertmaxrees I’m not sure what that means
[10:47:53] <robertmaxrees> instead of shotgunning objects into the global namespace, create a sort of sitewide structture.
[10:48:16] <robertmaxrees> so you'd have something like ctScience = {};, and then everything is added as properties to that object.
[10:48:27] <robertmaxrees> brb
[10:49:53] <desophos> do name and id attributes matter to jquery mobile? that is, can i set them to anything i want or do certain ids trigger some magic?
[10:53:55] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: i cant reproduce the issue in my jsfiddle :( http://jsfiddle.net/kzv2328w/9/
[10:55:17] <notchris> @robertmaxrees Well for the time being I’ve loaded the script only for the index
[10:55:21] <notchris> And the calendar page
[10:57:50] <dglambert> how can I use the result of the previous call in javascript, isn't that 'this'
[10:58:19] <dglambert> trying to do, document.URL.substring(this.indexOf('//')+2)
[11:01:20] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: think this could have to do with positioning in css?
[11:06:14] <dandaman> i think it had to do with position: relative on my carou-arrow-row class
[11:07:20] <desophos> i'm using django with jquery mobile; is it possible to make django-dynamic-formset work with jquery mobile?
[11:07:48] <desophos> for reference: https://github.com/elo80ka/django-dynamic-formset
[11:08:11] <desophos> jquery mobile seems to interfere with it somehow
[11:15:20] <shoky> dglambert: no, it's not 'this'. store the previous result in a variable and use that
[11:15:52] <dglambert> yeah I was more wondering if it existed already as a syntax
[11:15:55] <dglambert> that I didn't know about
[11:31:01] <guideX> how do I change <input type="radio" checked /> to <input type="radio" /> and back to <input type="radio" checked />
[11:31:11] <guideX> and not checked="checked"
[11:31:12] <robertmaxrees> .prop('checked', false)
[11:31:14] <guideX> ah ok
[11:31:22] <guideX> thanks lemme try
[11:32:32] <guideX> hmmm
[11:32:44] <robertmaxrees> don't look at the HTML
[11:32:52] <robertmaxrees> that won't accurately reflect the checkbox.
[11:33:13] <guideX> ah there it goes :) (had it backwards lol)
[11:33:21] <guideX> thanks!
[11:33:26] <robertmaxrees> sure
[11:33:26] <guideX> I always forget about .prop and go for .attr
[11:34:34] <guideX> I need a midget sitting next to me who slaps me everytime I use old jquery syntax
[11:34:55] <guideX> or maybe like a little avi of that jurrasic park guy popping up saying "NUH UH UH!!"
[11:35:09] <Uhkis> lol
[11:41:53] <Sagar> hello i am trying to validate email, http://pastebin.com/NRpPnbs1 this is my code, i want my code to echo the error in the <ul> tag while if the email is valid, i want it to echo in <input> tag of email. How can i do that?
[11:42:20] <robertmaxrees> Sagar ask in ##php
[11:42:30] <Sagar> ok
[11:48:33] <desophos> is the information here still true? http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-scripting.html
[11:48:44] <robertmaxrees> for version 1.2, yes
[11:48:54] <desophos> sorry, i meant for 1.4.5
[11:49:14] <desophos> because i can't find anything about it in the 1.4.5 docs
[11:49:15] <desophos> oh wait, i'm looking at the demos stuff :p
[11:49:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:52:49] <desophos> regardless, that seems a lot more detailed than what i can find in the 1.4 api doc
[11:52:50] <desophos> s
[11:55:03] <desophos> so how much of that is still true for 1.4.5? it seems like what it describes is happening to me (not loading scripts in <head>)
[11:55:14] <Alina-malina> is the jquery equivalent of this navigator.platform; is accurate?
[11:56:23] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina what is the jquery equivalent?
[11:56:54] <Alina-malina> ohnok
[11:57:02] <Alina-malina> i thought it has equivalent
[11:57:33] <robertmaxrees> desophos i'm lost - are you running 1.4.5?  have you looked at http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/ ?
[11:57:54] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina old versions had a browser detection feature, but that's been removed.
[11:58:09] <Alina-malina> oh i see
[11:58:32] <Alina-malina> by the way, is it possible to compile into java t he jquerymobile app? or it just works inside browser? i need it to work as separate app for android?
[11:58:39] <desophos> robertmaxrees: yes and yes, but i can't seem to find this information in those docs
[11:59:23] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina javascript and java have nothing to do with one another - you need another platform to run the "app" as if it were native.
[11:59:46] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina phonegap and cordova are two popular choices.
[11:59:50] <robertmaxrees> desophos what problem are you having?
[12:00:00] <Alina-malina> lol ok
[12:01:00] <desophos> robertmaxrees: it appears that scripts in a page's <head> don't load
[12:01:13] <desophos> when i load the page, that is.
[12:01:15] <robertmaxrees> when you navigate to them?
[12:01:17] <desophos> right
[12:01:18] <robertmaxrees> or load them directly?
[12:01:30] <robertmaxrees> because the <head> doesn't reload when using jquery mobile.
[12:01:36] <robertmaxrees> just the contents of the page.
[12:01:51] <desophos> ok, that's the problem i'm encountering then
[12:01:56] <robertmaxrees> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/pages/ describes everything you need.
[12:02:20] <robertmaxrees> you can turn off the ajax features IIRC and load them as per usual if you wnat.
[12:02:59] <desophos> i've read that page and it doesn't mention not reloading <head> as far as i can tell
[12:03:12] <desophos> not specifically at least
[12:03:15] <robertmaxrees> desophos it addresses how the pages work.
[12:03:19] <robertmaxrees> which is the important part here.
[12:05:35] <desophos> robertmaxrees: i guess the caching is the reason <head> scripts aren't reloaded?
[12:05:56] <cariveri> hey gain: this wont work: if (! ( $carea.is(':visible') ) ){    :why?
[12:06:07] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ cariveri
[12:06:07] <b-ot> cariveri: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:06:46] <robertmaxrees> desophos it's not caching, it's that the <head> literally isn't touched.
[12:06:58] <robertmaxrees> the contents of <head> aren't reloaded in a default setup for jqm.
[12:07:27] <desophos> hm, okay. well, i think that should be made clear and described along with ways to handle page-specific scripts
[12:07:34] <robertmaxrees> it is described there.
[12:07:38] <robertmaxrees> read the entire page lol
[12:08:55] <robertmaxrees> cariveri btw the code you shared could be simplified to if (!$carea.is(':visible')) { - check http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/ to see how to define "visible"
[12:11:09] <desophos> robertmaxrees: i did several times, but i don't see a specific mention anywhere of what you're talking about
[12:11:26] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* you need to read the documentation to grok the concepts behind what's happening.
[12:11:28] <cariveri> thanks. I found it myself
[12:11:44] <robertmaxrees> using that knowledge, you hook into related events and page data to run the code you want.
[12:12:58] <robertmaxrees> you can't really rely on an FAQ for every little problem that might arise.
[12:14:21] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know if you can use AJAX in a 'mutation observer' instance?
[12:14:33] <robertmaxrees> clarify?
[12:15:47] <desophos> well, i read as much of the docs as seemed relevant, and i had no idea why my scripts weren't being loaded; i guess the docs assume some familiarity or skill with JS that i don't have. i also would have no clue how to go about forcing my scripts to execute on page reload were it not for the 1.2.0 docs i found -- why are those so much more detailed?
[12:16:04] <robertmaxrees> desophos they're detailed in a different way.
[12:16:14] <robertmaxrees> the current docs are much clearer and more focused imo.
[12:16:29] <robertmaxrees> not having familiarity with JS would be a bit of an issue, though.
[12:16:40] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees:  I'm using mutation observer to detect if an element is created into the DOM.  If it is, then I inject values into the element using AJAX, or values from the server
[12:16:47] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque that's a bad idea.
[12:16:50] <jeffreylevesque> i got the mutation observer working
[12:16:58] <robertmaxrees> you'll trigger the observer for every change you make.
[12:17:24] <robertmaxrees> but the short answer is yes, you can call ajax (or any other code, really) within that callback.
[12:18:44] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: my ajax causes the browser to freeze - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/a299719a131b84fb951b67f802463241eab03eb3/src/js/ajax_session.js
[12:19:08] <robertmaxrees> right - because you're triggering the mutation observer every time you change the document.
[12:19:14] <robertmaxrees> which is why you avoid them like the plague.
[12:19:37] <robertmaxrees> s/document/that element
[12:19:46] <jeffreylevesque> but, i set it to 'form'
[12:19:53] <jeffreylevesque> so, when the form changes
[12:19:57] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:20:23] <robertmaxrees> every time you touch it, you fire the ajax, which changes it, which triggers the observer, which fires the ajax, which changes it...
[12:20:47] <jeffreylevesque> wait, is it an infinite loop?
[12:20:54] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:21:32] <robertmaxrees> this is why you don't use mutation observers if you can avoid it ;)
[12:21:36] <jeffreylevesque> so my ajax is running infinitely, instead of when a specific element is created? I thought i put some conditional logic
[12:21:52] <robertmaxrees> think about how that's working ;)
[12:22:05] <robertmaxrees> it's still firing the observer.
[12:22:43] <robertmaxrees> use direct callbacks instead of mutation observers
[12:23:50] <jeffreylevesque> my form is generated dynamically using jquery.  If i replace the MO, do i define the callbacks within the scope of the js scipt that conditionally creates the form?
[12:24:16] <robertmaxrees> are you calling things to generate them?
[12:24:21] <robertmaxrees> or are they just running?
[12:24:30] <robertmaxrees> that is to say, did you define functions that you call out to?
[12:24:52] <jeffreylevesque> https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/html_form.js
[12:24:56] <jeffreylevesque> that creates my forms
[12:25:01] <robertmaxrees> woah
[12:25:03] <jeffreylevesque> bunch of nested 'on' methods
[12:25:10] <robertmaxrees> don't next event handlers.
[12:25:15] <robertmaxrees> *nest
[12:26:56] <jeffreylevesque> how do i detect whether a form field is created using my 'html_form.js'?
[12:27:05] <robertmaxrees> you're doing this the wrong way imo.
[12:27:25] <robertmaxrees> define functions that you explicitly call to create things, and define callbacks in those functions to move forward.
[12:30:26] <desophos> at the risk of sounding terribly uninformed, what is ".selector"? e.g. http://api.jquerymobile.com/page/#event-create
[12:30:43] <desophos> i looked it up but really can't find anything useful... and http://api.jquery.com/selector/ says it was removed in 1.9
[12:31:18] <desophos> "A selector representing selector passed to jQuery()" tells me nothing
[12:39:32] <DeltaHeavy> I have an element that looks like the following and $('#IPTV|6a0fee7b-cb77-4996-af88-050e42137329') won't select it
[12:39:43] <DeltaHeavy> <li class="mte-device-modal__device" id="IPTV|6a0fee7b-cb77-4996-af88-050e42137329" data-producturl="/Fibe_TV/Products/Nova_Remote" data-continueurl="/Fibe_TV" data-alias="Nova_Remote" data-showmodaltype="SaveToCookie" data-popupimageurl="/Styles/tv/all_languages/all_regions/catalog_images/large/accessories/Nova_remote.png">
[12:43:20] <robertmaxrees> desophos that's an example selector.
[12:43:25] <robertmaxrees> like a CSS selector.
[12:43:34] <desophos> oh haha, just a placeholder?
[12:43:40] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy probably need to escape the |
[12:43:50] <robertmaxrees> desophos yep
[12:44:05] <desophos> alright, makes sense then, thanks
[12:44:11] <DeltaHeavy> $('#IPTV\|6a0fee7b-cb77-4996-af88-050e42137329') won't work
[12:45:53] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy two backslashes, not one.
[12:46:00] <robertmaxrees> $('#IPTV\\|6a0fee7b-cb77-4996-af88-050e42137329')
[12:47:04] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xvhw0j1b/
[12:56:22] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Not working in IE8-10
[12:56:32] <DeltaHeavy> Don't have access to 11 atm but I need it to work as low as IE8
[12:56:34] <DeltaHeavy> So odd
[12:56:46] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you on?
[12:58:23] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xvhw0j1b/ works fine in 11 for me.
[12:58:37] <DeltaHeavy> 1.7...
[12:58:43] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:58:48] <DeltaHeavy> 1.7.2
[12:58:55] <robertmaxrees> 3 years old.
[12:58:57] <DeltaHeavy> IE10's console is pretty damn useless too
[12:58:58] <DeltaHeavy> And yup
[12:59:08] <robertmaxrees> ie10's console is fine-ish.  one sec.
[12:59:16] <DeltaHeavy> When I give it a selector
[12:59:17] <DeltaHeavy> It just returns
[12:59:21] <DeltaHeavy> [Object, object]
[12:59:24] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:59:27] <DeltaHeavy> And a bunch of other useless information lol
[13:00:06] <robertmaxrees> your markup is valid, right?
[13:00:29] <robertmaxrees> IE10 works fine.
[13:00:39] <robertmaxrees> with 1.7.2 - http://jsfiddle.net/xvhw0j1b/1/
[13:00:40] <DeltaHeavy> It's not perfect
[13:01:23] <robertmaxrees> it does exactly what it's supposed to do - selects the given element.
[13:01:29] <robertmaxrees> IE9 works, as well.
[13:01:45] <DeltaHeavy> And clicks it
[13:01:48] <robertmaxrees> that selector is fine accross each 9, 10, and 11.  not sure about 8, but it's probably fine.
[13:01:51] <DeltaHeavy> $(('#' + productID).replace('|', '\\|')).find('a').click();
[13:01:55] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[13:02:01] <robertmaxrees> .click() is tricky in old IE.
[13:02:07] <DeltaHeavy> Even IE10?
[13:02:13] <robertmaxrees> can be, yeah.
[13:02:18] <DeltaHeavy> Christ
[13:02:24] <DeltaHeavy> Cancer on everybody who uses IE
[13:02:25] <robertmaxrees> part of why i tell people to not route logic through the DOM like that.
[13:02:35] <robertmaxrees> cancer on people who use the DOM to route logic ;)
[13:02:38] <robertmaxrees> IE is fine IMO.
[13:02:51] <DeltaHeavy> It's by far the easiest way to do this without doing TONS and TONS of shit due to TONS of developers working on this shit
[13:02:54] <DeltaHeavy> 'Making unmodular shit
[13:02:58] <DeltaHeavy> Just trying to fix a bug any way they can
[13:03:10] <cjohnson> well cancer on the people who set things up so horribly :P
[13:03:11] <DeltaHeavy> So I have to resort to this bullshit or spend 100 hours on something I'm allotted only a couple hours to do
[13:03:16] <DeltaHeavy> Cancer on IE users the most
[13:03:18] <DeltaHeavy> Literally worse than hiterl
[13:03:30] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy i hate chrome more than IE.
[13:03:37] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy are you trying to run an event handler on that link?
[13:03:37] <DeltaHeavy> Why?
[13:03:38] <robertmaxrees> or what?
[13:03:43] <cjohnson> blasphemey chrome is god
[13:03:44] <DeltaHeavy> 2 good 2 handle?
[13:03:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery core has more fixes for webket/blink than any other browser ;)
[13:03:54] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: I do have one yes
[13:04:03] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy is that what you're trying to run with that .click()?
[13:04:13] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: No, it's from elsewhere.
[13:04:29] <robertmaxrees> back up - what exactly are you trying to accomplish with that .click() then?
[13:04:33] <robertmaxrees> just go to the URL?
[13:04:38] <DeltaHeavy> Nvm
[13:04:39] <DeltaHeavy> It's not a link
[13:04:40] <DeltaHeavy> It's a <li>
[13:04:47] <robertmaxrees> same diff.
[13:04:48] <DeltaHeavy> With some data-* for links
[13:04:57] <DeltaHeavy> I can't just append this button onto the event handler
[13:04:59] <DeltaHeavy> It causes 1000 issues
[13:05:00] <robertmaxrees> basically, abstract out the event handler instead.
[13:05:14] <robertmaxrees> and call it explicitly, instead of implicitly through the DOM.
[13:05:27] <DeltaHeavy> It fucks shit up to some nth degree of hell for reasons I have no idea about
[13:08:00] <DeltaHeavy> I feel like there's a huge problem in my work where JS is seen as "scripting" not not REAL programming like C#.NET so they all ass about it thinking it's ezmode shit and end up writing the most awful JS of life
[13:08:04] <DeltaHeavy> Cuz not reaaal
[13:08:36] <DeltaHeavy> I will never understand how people make a distinction between "programming" and "scripting" like that. scripting is a sub-set of programming...so yes...it's programming.
[13:09:09] <robertmaxrees> not just that, JS is a full-fledged language in its own right.
[13:09:35] <robertmaxrees> i started making my coworkers recognize that JS is a real thing and we should treat it as a first class citizen in our frontent codebase.
[13:09:35] <DeltaHeavy> Of course
[13:09:43] <robertmaxrees> once we did that, bugs and shit started going away.
[13:09:54] <robertmaxrees> i did a few presos on the language and its pitfalls and niceties.
[13:09:57] <robertmaxrees> went over really well.
[13:16:02] <Robdgreat> what do they reckon is the difference between a scripting language and a programming language? compilation?
[13:16:14] <Robdgreat> if so, it's a silly distinction
[13:16:18] <DeltaHeavy> Yup
[13:16:21] <robertmaxrees> probably just the miscon-
[13:16:23] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:16:24] <DeltaHeavy> SO many programmers I talk to even on Freenode think like that.
[13:16:27] <robertmaxrees> so python is a scripting language?
[13:16:30] <DeltaHeavy> YEP
[13:16:34] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:16:36] <DeltaHeavy> NOT RL PROGRMMNG
[13:16:39] <DeltaHeavy> LOLSCRUUUB
[13:16:43] * DeltaHeavy head explodes
[13:16:50] <Robdgreat> "it differs from what I use"
[13:16:52] <robertmaxrees> except they ARE compiled...
[13:16:54] <robertmaxrees> sooooo...
[13:17:10] <DeltaHeavy> Most people don't know the difference between a progrmaming language and an implementation of one
[13:17:22] <Robdgreat> hell, I don't know that I do
[13:17:23] <robertmaxrees> javascript vs ecmascript.
[13:18:09] <DeltaHeavy> C -> gcc and whatever the hell else
[13:18:34] <NoiseEee> i like eggs
[13:23:29] <R13ose> BillCriswell: On this page: http://ecosanity.org/ How come the thumbnails in the box when you hover over the background image are not clickable?  Might be the preventDefault() but can't be sure.
[13:24:05] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault(); in that handler it looks like.
[13:26:12] <R13ose> I am using the jquery cycle plugin, so how do I fix this?
[13:26:25] <BillCriswell> R13ose: I'm thinking the .cycle(index) prevents the default action?
[13:27:52] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Also, you're relying on hover way too much here. Someone without a mouse wouldn't be able to navigate this at all.
[13:28:43] <phelix> So I have a long site.. its broken into sections with containers like id="first" id="second" etc... I have a position:fixed element at the bottom of the page that will have an UP and a DOWN link to navagate back to the section above or the section below.. But if you free scroll using the sidebar how can the I configure the up or down box to know where to go next? This make any sense?
[13:28:44] <robertmaxrees> R13ose you've been asking a lot of basic questions lately.  have you considered going through the jquery learning center and covering the basics?
[13:28:48] <phelix> is there a solution for this?
[13:29:18] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: basic questions?  I know jQuery but could brush up my knowledge.  Is this wrong to ask basic questions?
[13:29:37] <R13ose> BillCriswell: okay and using mouse events are better?
[13:29:47] <robertmaxrees> it's fine to ask questions, but you're asking the same questions pretty regularly.
[13:30:27] <BillCriswell> phelix: You can keep track of the offset().top of the secitons and put them into an array, and when the button is clicked look at the scrollTop of the window and decide where to go from there by looping through the array.
[13:30:56] <phelix> hmm... ok, let me look into that thank you
[13:31:20] <BillCriswell> If up is clicked go to the first one that's offset().top is >= scrollTop, otherwise do the same thing and just go back an array item.
[13:31:36] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: the same question, I would not say they are.  They are similar but not the same.  After this question is answer I will be quiet for awhile.
[13:31:51] <robertmaxrees> lots of basics about event handling and stuff.
[13:31:54] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[13:32:07] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: what kind of questions should I ask??
[13:32:25] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I commented out cycle.cycle(index); and didn't help me be able to click the image to go to another page.
[13:32:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying you should go through the tutorials in the learning center :)
[13:33:04] <BillCriswell> R13ose: I didn't see the event.preventDefault() robertmaxrees was talking about but if that didn't do it then what robertmaxrees would be it.
[13:34:07] <robertmaxrees> bbiab lunch
[13:34:09] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: how would I get rid of e.preventDefault()?
[13:34:16] <robertmaxrees> delete the line of code.
[13:34:54] <robertmaxrees> ah that's in jquery cycle.  nvm.  you don't.
[13:34:59] <robertmaxrees> sorry - didn't see that bit.
[13:35:03] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[13:36:13] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: hahaha, thanks.
[13:36:21] <phelix> BillCriswell: using that offset method you were talking about.. What if they change the size of the browser? Will it mess that up since the offset changes?
[13:36:44] <BillCriswell> phelix: I'd regrab those on resize events.
[13:36:50] <phelix> hmm ok
[13:37:01] <BillCriswell> phelix: You know what... might be able to do this without that.
[13:37:09] <BillCriswell> Let me try something.
[13:37:14] <phelix> sure
[13:37:20] <R13ose> BillCriswell: any other thoughts?
[13:45:28] <joeyDB> wizards of jquery...i summonnnn youuuu...
[13:45:38] * joeyDB waves staff
[13:45:50] <joeyDB> i'm looking for a plugin that does this: http://maryjaneansell.squarespace.com/9jt4jssoq4t1f7sz913xvcy8c4vj80
[13:46:01] <joeyDB> and I'm going to extend the shit out of it
[13:46:08] <joeyDB> anybody?
[13:52:19] <BillCriswell> It's getting to that point in the day where I'm missing obvious stuff.
[13:53:00] <R13ose> BillCriswell: like?
[13:53:13] <BillCriswell> The thing I'm writing up for phelix.
[13:53:51] <R13ose> okay
[13:55:15] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I thought you were looking at my problem but I know you are always busy.
[14:01:09] <Omar-> hi everyone
[14:01:33] <joeyDB> oh hi bill
[14:01:58] <BillCriswell> Jesus Christ.
[14:02:00] <BillCriswell> joeyDB: Oh hi hha.
[14:02:06] <BillCriswell> This was working all along I'm just slow.
[14:02:23] <BillCriswell> Wait no it isn't.
[14:02:40] <phelix> BillCriswell: http://hastebin.com/pahugimaca.coffee
[14:02:49] <phelix> im trying something like this.. I think this might work
[14:04:12] <BillCriswell> phelix: That's not a good approach in the long run.
[14:04:24] <phelix> really?
[14:04:47] <FoolsRun> Hello, I'm having a problem with .split(). The string I'm giving it occasionally only includes a single value, and split() fails when that happens. How can I correct for that?
[14:06:22] <BillCriswell> Yeah, when you want to add other sections you're screwed.
[14:06:28] <Omar-> FoolsRun: string example?
[14:06:47] <coach_McGuirk> i have a newbie jquery question if anyone is interested in answering
[14:07:03] <FoolsRun> Omar-: "1,2,3"  or "1"
[14:07:18] <phelix> Yea, would need to add more jquery to accomidate new sections
[14:10:32] <BillCriswell> phelix: http://jsbin.com/sedasageqa/1/edit?html,js,output
[14:10:34] <BillCriswell> there we go.
[14:10:49] <R13ose> that is amazing
[14:10:59] <FoolsRun> Omar-: any thoughts?
[14:11:37] <phelix> BillCriswell: Ahh nice, this is much cleaner :) thank you very much, let me play with this
[14:11:45] <BillCriswell> Good luck!
[14:12:18] <R13ose> BillCriswell++
[14:14:27] <R13ose> BillCriswell: can I pm you?
[14:14:37] <BillCriswell> R13ose: I'm actually about to pack up and head home
[14:14:42] <BillCriswell> If I'm on tonight I'll ping you.
[14:15:11] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I have a 2 meetings tonight so will not be on tonight but thanks for the help.
[14:15:21] <BillCriswell> R13ose: No problem.
[14:15:26] <BillCriswell> Take care!
[14:17:15] <coach_McGuirk> anyone interested in taking a newbie jquery question?
[14:17:45] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ coach_McGuirk
[14:17:45] <b-ot> coach_McGuirk: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:17:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:20:38] <Omar-> FoolsRun sorry I was AFK
[14:21:02] <coach_McGuirk> im trying to grab the data-file from a li tag to associate which CSS id i want to toggle using jquery.  I tried using a function but it only just displays in console the function itself not what im trying to do with it.  If I try to use a jquery command it only grabs the first li not the li chosen.  Im doing this with draggable and droppable jquery UI
[14:21:32] <FoolsRun> Omar-: I think I figured it out. I'm passing the string via a data attribute and apparently the jQuery data() function can be weird about strings. attr() is working better.
[14:22:25] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ coach_McGuirk
[14:22:25] <b-ot> coach_McGuirk: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:22:41] <coach_McGuirk> http://jsfiddle.net/sys_kmburke/4mfmqnyf/
[14:22:41] <Omar-> FoolsRun you can do something like string.toString().length
[14:24:21] <Omar-> FoolsRun nevermind, ignore my previous
[14:24:22] <robertmaxrees> coach_McGuirk that code is tossing an error btw.
[14:24:30] <Omar-> comment
[14:25:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4mfmqnyf/1/ coach_McGuirk with jquery ui added.
[14:25:04] <coach_McGuirk> oh, i just snipped a bit of it not the whole thing.  Should i do the whole thing?
[14:25:27] <robertmaxrees> should the snippet you provided basically work?
[14:25:34] <robertmaxrees> also, console.log(getThumbID); doesn't work.
[14:26:02] <robertmaxrees> you need to run the function by placing () after.
[14:26:17] <robertmaxrees> and then pass in the ui object.
[14:26:23] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: let me try this again
[14:26:36] <FoolsRun> Omar-: Fixed it. Used attr() rather than data() and made absolutely sure my vars were set to "" if nothing was returned. Working now.
[14:26:44] <FoolsRun> Omar-: You got me thinking in the right direction. Thanks!
[14:27:18] <robertmaxrees> coach_McGuirk also, just doing $(ui.draggable).data('file'); in that function just reads the value - it doesn't necessarily do anything else with it.  you want to return that value.
[14:27:25] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/sys_kmburke/4mfmqnyf/2/
[14:27:33] <Omar-> FoolsRun you're welcome, though, I did nothing ;)
[14:28:26] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: there is a google analytics error, i dont know whats causing that. not sure if you see that or not
[14:28:31] <robertmaxrees> coach_McGuirk one sec
[14:29:51] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: yea, im just trying to return the value of the data-src so i can i add that to a jquery toggle
[14:30:06] <robertmaxrees> coach_McGuirk yeah, lemme show you what's up.  one moment.
[14:30:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4mfmqnyf/4/
[14:31:00] <robertmaxrees> okay, so check this out.
[14:31:07] <robertmaxrees> it's still broken, but we'll deal with that in a sec.
[14:31:11] <robertmaxrees> see the difference?
[14:31:52] <coach_McGuirk> yea, i actually tried prop src but couldnt get what i wanted with that
[14:32:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:32:21] <robertmaxrees> no, the function.
[14:32:32] <robertmaxrees> getThumbID() - see what i'm doing differently there?
[14:32:36] <robertmaxrees> the way it's defined and called?
[14:32:55] <coach_McGuirk> ohh
[14:33:05] <coach_McGuirk> yea thats a bit diff
[14:33:51] <robertmaxrees> also, the ui.draggable object is the img itself.
[14:33:52] <coach_McGuirk> so the returns are just like any OO lang in jquery?
[14:33:54] <robertmaxrees> not the LI.
[14:34:00] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't a language.
[14:34:03] <robertmaxrees> javascript is.
[14:34:26] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, returns in JS work like any other language.
[14:34:40] <robertmaxrees> except ruby, which assumes you want to return the last expression iirc.
[14:34:54] <coach_McGuirk> ok good to know
[14:37:00] <robertmaxrees> see the issue with your .data() call on ui.draggable ?
[14:37:37] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: you mean the console.log at the bottom?
[14:37:42] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:37:57] <robertmaxrees> return ui.draggable.data('file'); will always return undefined in your case.
[14:38:50] <joeyDB> how do you prevent, say, bootstrap's carousel click event?
[14:39:06] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:39:07] <coach_McGuirk> is that because i dont want to return ui.draggable but the li instead?
[14:39:25] <robertmaxrees> coach_McGuirk either that, or move the draggable class to the LIs instead.
[14:39:27] <robertmaxrees> either/or.
[14:39:35] <robertmaxrees> joeyDB that doesn't make sense.
[14:39:57] <coach_McGuirk> oh, i didnt try that yet
[14:39:58] <joeyDB> hah well i want to replace the click event...overriding the functionality to slide the slider
[14:40:14] <joeyDB> i don't want to use bootstrap's carousel functioanltiy
[14:40:21] <joeyDB> god i'm so tired i can't spell anymore
[14:40:22] <robertmaxrees> you can preventDefault() on the click event, yeah.
[14:40:46] <joeyDB> yeah it still slides though
[14:40:52] <robertmaxrees> share the code?
[14:42:35] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/5ndngwvz/1/ at the very bottom there is a UP and a DOWN link.. the up link seems to be working ok but I can't seem to figure out what is causing the DOWN link not to work properly... Anyone have an idea?
[14:44:25] <joeyDB> you know what nevermind robertmaxrees. I'm just going to remove an attribute that triggers it from the link
[14:45:00] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: i guess it works, however it broke the functionality so i need to figure out whats going wrong
[14:45:38] <coach_McGuirk> it takes me a bit to understand whats going wrong
[14:45:44] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[14:53:06] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: how come my url comes back undefined if i move the class droppable to the li?
[14:53:17] <coach_McGuirk> *draggable
[14:53:34] <robertmaxrees> because now you're changing the object you're looking at :)
[14:54:07] <robertmaxrees> ui.draggable is now the <li>, not the <img>
[14:54:31] <coach_McGuirk> oh, of course
[14:54:53] <robertmaxrees> and don't do $(ui.draggable).prop('src'); - ui.draggable.prop('src'); is sufficient
[14:55:10] <phelix> robertmaxrees: Anyway I could talk ya into checking out that fiddle.. Really stuck on why the down doesn't work properly..
[14:56:10] <Omar-> goodnight everyone
[14:56:40] <robertmaxrees> phelix because you
[14:56:49] <robertmaxrees> *you're hitting goTo = index; each time.
[14:57:39] <robertmaxrees> that first if statement is your issue.
[14:57:41] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: thanks man, im gonna try to figure out the rest
[14:58:00] <robertmaxrees> awesome duder.
[14:58:04] <phelix> if (top >= offsetTop) { this one here?
[14:58:20] <robertmaxrees> err, the first one inside of that.
[14:59:24] <robertmaxrees> if (top === offsetTop && !goingUp) { - this one.
[14:59:47] <phelix> yeah, trying to look at that one now.
[14:59:50] <robertmaxrees> basically, right now the only way you can increase index is if top === offsetTop and you're "going down"
[14:59:54] <robertmaxrees> the "and" is the issue.
[15:01:01] <phelix> ok there we go. I think I got it now
[15:01:15] <robertmaxrees> this is where debuggers really shine.
[15:03:22] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to change an attribute dinamically when I click, but it only changes one time: http://jsfiddle.net/cagdea4p/1/
[15:03:28] <abailarri> any suggestion please?
[15:03:55] <robertmaxrees> you're mixing your .data() and .attr() usage.
[15:04:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cagdea4p/3/
[15:04:18] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[15:06:35] <reynierpm> hi, in a set of span elements as for ex <span class="label label-default" data-country="1">Span1</span>, <span class="label label-default" data-country="2">Span2</span>, <span class="label label-default" data-country="3">Span3</span> how do I remove the span with data-country=¨2¨?
[15:06:38] <CapnKlutch> Can someone please tell me why doesn't this work
[15:06:41] <CapnKlutch> http://jsfiddle.net/mbwcqnq2/
[15:07:02] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm $('[data-country="2"]').remove();
[15:07:17] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mbwcqnq2/1/
[15:07:21] <robertmaxrees> you put your code in the wrong box.
[15:07:31] <CapnKlutch> lol yap I just realized that
[15:07:40] <robertmaxrees> and use console.log() instead of alert :)
[15:08:00] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, thanks
[15:08:20] <robertmaxrees> abailarri when using data attributes, use .data() only.
[15:08:30] <abailarri> ok robertmaxrees
[15:08:39] <reynierpm> thanks robertmaxrees I will try
[15:10:36] <CapnKlutch> Okay so here is the situation, I need to make the content editable on click and also be able to click the link, this works fine on a pc but not on mobile. is there anyway to make it work on mobile? - http://jsfiddle.net/mbwcqnq2/3/
[15:10:50] <robertmaxrees> first, use .prop()
[15:11:00] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees take a look to this code http://jsbin.com/muyiregoqa/1/edit if $('.tagsInputFab-' + data.ent.idFabricanteProductoSolicitud) is empty then the first time the code gets executed this will be added <span class="label label-default" data-pais="' + ev.val.id + '">' + ev.val.text + '</span> otherwise will be this one <span class="label label-default" data-pais="' + ev.val.id + '">, ' + ev.val.text + '</span>, I am right?
[15:12:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:12:21] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, can you help me?
[15:12:30] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch use .prop() - startthere.
[15:12:48] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees nevermind, let me try first and if I got any problem I get back to you asking for help with more info
[15:12:52] <robertmaxrees> second, .click() won't work on mobile for what i think are obvious reasons :) search google about how to do event bindings for desktop and mobile.
[15:13:52] <CapnKlutch> I do use event bindings on my app just not on the fiddle
[15:14:02] <CapnKlutch> and how would I use .prop()
[15:14:28] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch you want .on(), not .click, and you want .prop() instead of .attr()
[15:14:41] <robertmaxrees> wait, what part of your code doesn't work on mobile?
[15:14:56] <CapnKlutch> You can take a look at my app
[15:15:01] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:15:05] <CapnKlutch> please
[15:15:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather you just explain it :)
[15:15:10] <CapnKlutch> Ok
[15:15:18] <robertmaxrees> does the fiddle illustrate it?
[15:15:24] <CapnKlutch> it is a todo list
[15:15:41] <CapnKlutch> and when the user clicks on the item it becomes editable
[15:16:10] <CapnKlutch> and I have some jQuery to make link text into links.
[15:16:27] <CapnKlutch> So when the user clicks the link it opens it as usual
[15:16:30] <robertmaxrees> wait so the fiddle doesn't illustrate the problem?
[15:16:58] <CapnKlutch> but on mobile it makes it editable and doesn't open the link
[15:17:02] <CapnKlutch> well it does
[15:17:18] <robertmaxrees> because your fiddle is broken for me on desktop.
[15:17:37] <CapnKlutch> I tried the fiddle on mobile and it is the same behavior as my app
[15:17:50] <CapnKlutch> This one? - http://jsfiddle.net/mbwcqnq2/3/
[15:17:57] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees how do I check if td is empty (not contain any text) or does not? $('.tagsInputFab-' + data.ent.idFabricanteProductoSolicitud).text() === ¨¨ ? that approach is not working for me
[15:18:02] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch yep.
[15:18:10] <CapnKlutch> What is broken about it
[15:18:19] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch clicking the link on desktop doesn't work.
[15:18:29] <CapnKlutch> What browser>
[15:18:30] <CapnKlutch> ?
[15:18:34] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm that's how you test if there's no text.
[15:18:35] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch ff
[15:18:54] <CapnKlutch> And then that is good, if we fix that it will for sure work for mobile
[15:18:57] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees weird let me dig into my code to see where I am messing up
[15:19:16] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm first try console.log($('.tagsInputFab-' + data.ent.idFabricanteProductoSolicitud)) and make sure you're selecting the right thing.
[15:19:26] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch what you're trying to do seems really awkward imo.
[15:19:50] <CapnKlutch> Yes but I dont see another way robertmaxrees
[15:20:29] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch you need to set those links as NOT editable.
[15:20:37] <CapnKlutch> should I have a listner for .text a and open the link and return false?
[15:20:56] <CapnKlutch> That will be user entered text
[15:21:12] <robertmaxrees> you can't have everything you want in this case.
[15:21:25] <CapnKlutch> So it isn't possible?
[15:21:34] <robertmaxrees> not as far as I can see.
[15:22:01] <CapnKlutch> can I say .text not .text a
[15:22:12] <CapnKlutch> is that possible
[15:22:23] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty nonsensical.
[15:23:24] <CapnKlutch> Well I'll keep trying and I'll let you know what happens
[15:23:31] <CapnKlutch> Thanks for your time robertmaxrees
[15:23:36] <robertmaxrees> good luck i guess >.>
[15:38:27] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: still around for questions?
[15:38:41] <coach_McGuirk> about the jquery i was working on
[15:39:00] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ coach_McGuirk
[15:39:00] <b-ot> coach_McGuirk: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:39:01] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:40:44] <coach_McGuirk> going back to my jquery i moved the class draggable to the li tags from the img tag.  The problem i have now is that I have to find another way to target the img src since class draggable is not on the same level.  How do i get to the level inside the li?
[15:40:54] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[15:41:06] <robertmaxrees> .find('img')
[15:42:36] <coach_McGuirk> so .find will put the cursor on the img?
[15:42:54] <coach_McGuirk> then i can use the prop command to get the src?
[15:47:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?  cursor?
[15:47:21] <robertmaxrees> share the fiddle again.
[15:47:47] <coach_McGuirk> ok let me update it
[15:49:02] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/sys_kmburke/4mfmqnyf/5/
[15:49:23] <robertmaxrees> woah
[15:49:32] <robertmaxrees> stop wrapping $() around everything :)
[15:49:48] <robertmaxrees> var href = ui.draggable.find('li').prop('src');
[15:49:56] <coach_McGuirk> i thought you have to, to let it know you are working with jquery
[15:50:08] <robertmaxrees> ui.draggable is already a jquery object.
[15:50:26] <robertmaxrees> and .prop('src') returns a string - you don't want to wrap that string in $()
[15:51:22] <coach_McGuirk> i guess that makes sense, i didnt look at it like that
[15:51:32] <robertmaxrees> doing $() is expensive, too.
[15:51:49] <robertmaxrees> so avoid doing it whenever possible.
[15:51:58] <coach_McGuirk> ill remember that
[15:54:20] <coach_McGuirk> i sorta got it
[15:54:40] <coach_McGuirk> its saying syntax error but its at least printing out the url again
[15:54:47] <robertmaxrees> on what line?
[15:55:22] <coach_McGuirk>             var href = ui.draggable.find('img').prop('src');
[15:55:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing an error.
[15:56:28] <coach_McGuirk> i get this "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: http://burkeoutdoors.com/kburkesandbox/assets/portfolio_images/WalzEq.jpg"
[15:56:58] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:57:37] <robertmaxrees> $(href).html("<img src='" + href + "'"+"width='750'"+ "height='500'">"");
[15:57:41] <robertmaxrees> this line is why.
[15:58:41] <coach_McGuirk> ohh
[15:59:09] <coach_McGuirk> i dont remember what that line did with my previous solution, i just knew it worked
[15:59:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:59:33] <coach_McGuirk> i took what was being printed out and adding some stuff to it
[15:59:58] <coach_McGuirk> oh well, it works now
[16:00:00] <coach_McGuirk> thank you sir
[16:00:02] <robertmaxrees> sure
[16:00:24] <coach_McGuirk> how many years of experience do you have with jquery if you dont mind me asking?
[16:00:39] <robertmaxrees> i... can't remember hahaha
[16:00:51] <robertmaxrees> a few years.
[16:01:04] <coach_McGuirk> oh ok, not something that u learned recently
[16:01:08] <robertmaxrees> probably like 3 and a half or something?
[16:01:26] <coach_McGuirk> im trying to be patient and hoping it will click soon
[16:01:26] <robertmaxrees> nah, but the API docs and basic javascript knowledge make it pretty simple.
[16:01:34] <robertmaxrees> are you learning javascript alonside it?
[16:01:43] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: no
[16:01:46] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[16:01:54] <robertmaxrees> you're writing javascript anyway.
[16:02:57] <coach_McGuirk> robertmaxrees: makes sense.  I took a class several years ago in javascript and forgot most of it.  At the time i was told if you understand javascript basics you can move right to jquery.  that prob doesnt apply when you forgot it all though
[16:03:16] <robertmaxrees> just takes some practice.  you'll pick it all back up.
[16:03:52] <coach_McGuirk> cool man, good advice.  Im out
[16:04:00] <coach_McGuirk> adios
[16:04:36] <h2mster> hi
[16:05:14] <robertmaxrees> sup
[16:06:02] <h2mster> is it ok to ask a question on datatables.net here?
[16:06:17] <robertmaxrees> you can try, but you might not have very much success.
[16:06:26] <robertmaxrees> their forums are generally better.
[16:06:43] <h2mster> are there any?
[16:06:59] <robertmaxrees> forums?  yeah.
[16:07:37] <tw2113> http://datatables.net/forums/
[16:07:54] <tw2113> listed right in the sidebar
[16:07:55] <robertmaxrees> (i was gonna let them find the link on the homepage that says "forums"
[16:07:56] <robertmaxrees> )
[16:08:08] <h2mster> mm thx  i hoped it was more irc..
[16:08:27] <robertmaxrees> h2mster i suggested that they set up an irc channel and they didn't want to.
[16:09:16] <tw2113> bunch of heathens
[16:09:22] <robertmaxrees> just weird imo.
[16:13:38] <h2mster> it's rather a design question anyway ;)   so..   i set up an editable table ... i click on a row and get an id.  by this id it it possible to load additional tables .  the question is : would one go by the datatables api to invoce these additional tables? it seems to be more efficant to use the pid to load the other editable tables and set em nicely by css on the page..
[16:14:06] <Miles8of9> http://pastebin.com/XxQhijUp   i want to clear autocomplete text box after user has selected a value... is this the right way?
[16:14:13] <h2mster> as there are 3 mysql datatables anyway
[16:14:39] <h2mster> by blur?
[16:14:46] <h2mster> oh pastebin
[16:15:42] <Miles8of9> i want to clear text box contents after user has selected a value
[16:16:21] <Miles8of9> blur just removes focus?
[16:16:42] <h2mster> yes  to do things afterwards
[16:17:01] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 that's basically how you do it.
[16:18:25] <Miles8of9> no... at moment after clicking the value from autocomplete dropdown, the textbox still has focus
[16:18:40] <robertmaxrees> wait waht?
[16:18:48] <robertmaxrees> i thought you wanted to clear the input.
[16:18:53] <Miles8of9> yes
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[16:19:08] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to do something else, as well?
[16:19:38] <Miles8of9> no... just those lines of code
[16:19:46] <robertmaxrees> okay, and the input isn't clearing?
[16:20:22] <Miles8of9> it is clearing but only if i use the  event.preventDefault();
[16:20:43] <robertmaxrees> There you go then.
[16:20:55] <Miles8of9> ok thanks
[16:29:40] <guideX> how do I select only the first tr's in a table, and not the nested within another table
[16:30:19] <guideX> so if I have, <table><tr><td><table><tr><td>Hi!</td></tr></table></td></tr></table> there should be exactly 1 tr
[16:30:59] <tandroid> guideX: http://api.jquery.com/first-of-type-selector/
[16:31:15] <tandroid> Or this would probably work http://api.jquery.com/first/
[16:31:16] <guideX> thank you :)
[16:51:16] <guideX> when I use this, $("ul.tabs li").click(function(e) {  it picks up the buttons inside
[16:51:24] <duch_kazatel> event bubbling.
[16:51:30] <Valduare> is there any reason this would not work on ios devices $(document).on( 'click', '.my-modal-launch', function () {
[16:51:35] <guideX> event bubbling..
[16:51:58] <duch_kazatel> events bubble up through documents.
[16:52:14] <duch_kazatel> guideX http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:52:20] <Valduare> ya need touchstart
[16:52:26] <duch_kazatel> Valduare yep.
[16:52:37] <Valduare> ty for help :)
[16:53:12] <guideX> oic, ok thanks!
[16:53:57] <guideX> ok wait..
[16:54:06] <guideX> I'm not controlling how the buttons even works
[16:54:15] <guideX> it's like an asp.net imagebutton
[16:54:23] <guideX> *event works
[16:54:23] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[16:54:28] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[16:54:31] <guideX> ah ok
[16:54:32] <robertmaxrees> the event still bubbles.
[16:54:42] <robertmaxrees> events happen no matter what.
[16:54:51] <robertmaxrees> whether or not you assign listeners is up to you.
[16:55:06] <guideX> ah ok, so how do I let the specific butttons "slip through"
[16:55:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:55:19] <guideX> I guess I'm not following, if I'm not controlling the button events
[16:55:22] <robertmaxrees> you mean not trigger the handler?
[16:55:30] <robertmaxrees> right, nor do you control the button events.
[16:55:33] <guideX> yeah, meaning, the li is picking up the buttons events..
[16:55:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:55:41] <robertmaxrees> that's how bubbling works.
[16:55:43] <robertmaxrees> it happens by default.
[16:56:18] <robertmaxrees> you can assign a listener to the buttons and do e.stopPropagation(); on those, or modify your other event listeners to exclude the buttons.
[16:56:34] <guideX> ah ok, but the buittons must be handled without me
[16:56:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:56:44] <guideX> the buttons js is setup without me
[16:57:01] <robertmaxrees> okay, then you need to bind a listener to them and run e.stopPropagation() on them.
[16:57:08] <guideX> I just do like an <asp:ImageButton .. type stuff, the li on the other hand, i'm handling the "return false" myself
[16:57:23] <Valduare> next question -   on touch devices it does not seem like there’s any sort of touch delay
[16:57:26] <guideX> if I stop propogation, the button doesn't work  though
[16:57:34] <guideX> I need the button event to be raised like normal
[16:57:36] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ guideX
[16:57:39] <b-ot> guideX: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:57:46] <robertmaxrees> something isn't clicking here.
[16:57:50] <Valduare> ie when im scrolling up by swiping on my cart   if I slide over a add cart button it adds it instantly even though im scrolling
[16:57:55] <guideX> ok 1 second, altghough I can't jsfiddle an asp.net imagebutton
[16:58:02] <guideX> so you'll have to imagine it
[16:58:02] <robertmaxrees> guideX you can fiddle the html.
[16:58:08] <robertmaxrees> asp outputs markup.
[16:58:20] <guideX> ok one second..
[16:58:22] <robertmaxrees> so give me the markup.  that's what the javascript knows about, too.
[17:02:15] <guideX> http://jsfiddle.net/890zLes5/1/
[17:02:31] <guideX> the image event is of course rendered by asp.net
[17:02:38] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:02:53] <robertmaxrees> valid markup up./
[17:02:56] <robertmaxrees> *yo
[17:03:18] <guideX> http://jsfiddle.net/890zLes5/3/
[17:03:20] <guideX> sorry
[17:04:27] <robertmaxrees> is this missing something?
[17:04:32] <robertmaxrees> i click an li and get the console.log()
[17:04:44] <guideX> ah, but I wanna do something else when the button is clicked
[17:04:52] <guideX> you see, the problem is, i'm not deciding what that something is
[17:05:01] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:05:14] <guideX> asp.net imagebutons render down to <input's
[17:05:16] <robertmaxrees> so there's already a listener bound to those buttons?
[17:05:19] <guideX> yeha
[17:05:21] <guideX> yeah
[17:05:35] <guideX> it's (the events of tyghe buttons) are rendered by asp.net
[17:05:57] <guideX> trying to micromanage them is like an effort in futility
[17:06:06] <robertmaxrees> stop talking about asp.
[17:06:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:06:15] <robertmaxrees> just ignore that part :) http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/890zLes5/4/
[17:06:17] <robertmaxrees> so like this.
[17:06:42] <robertmaxrees> so you want clicks on those inputs to not trigger the handler on the <li>?
[17:06:48] <guideX> yeah
[17:07:02] <guideX> I need like a selector that says "these li's, but not anything else
[17:07:10] <robertmaxrees> actually, no.
[17:07:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:07:11] <guideX> like nothing underneath
[17:07:12] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:07:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/890zLes5/5/
[17:08:01] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[17:08:41] <robertmaxrees> or something like it.
[17:08:42] <guideX> yes, I tghink this is it
[17:08:45] <guideX> or close
[17:08:46] <guideX> thanks!
[17:08:56] <guideX> it's the e.target I think is the key
[17:09:59] <desophos> hi, it seems jquery mobile isn't playing nice with django-dynamic-formset; i can't get the remove form button to render, and i think it has something to do with the script being called before jquery mobile renders the forms. this is django-dynamic-formset: https://github.com/elo80ka/django-dynamic-formset/blob/master/src/jquery.formset.js
[17:10:43] <desophos> i believe the relevant code is lines 99-125
[17:10:54] <robertmaxrees> desophos okay - then have them fix it?
[17:10:55] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:11:00] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10998022/integrating-django-dynamic-formsets-with-jquery-mobiles-radio-buttons
[17:11:02] <desophos> and row.is(':visible') returns false
[17:11:03] <robertmaxrees> this might be pertinent
[17:11:34] <guideX> yes! yes it works fine
[17:11:36] <guideX> few...
[17:14:22] <desophos> robertmaxrees: hmm... i don't seem to be having that problem; my add button works fine but the remove button simply doesn't appear
[17:14:53] <robertmaxrees> Dessimat0r you're asking us to troubleshoot blind here, and the cloning of the form seems pertinent here.
[17:14:55] <robertmaxrees> but i could be wrong.
[17:15:42] <robertmaxrees> err, desophos
[17:15:45] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete.
[17:17:12] <desophos> well, the remove button should appear even before i clone the form; i think the problem is that row.is(':visible') returns false (during the initial execution) for some reason when it should return true (as it does when i try it in the console)
[17:17:21] <desophos> i can dpaste my django code if needed
[17:17:36] <robertmaxrees> desophos that's a question for a channel about django >.>
[17:17:42] <robertmaxrees> i'd start googling.
[17:18:12] <robertmaxrees> without a functioning, self-contained example it's really hard knowing how to help.
[17:21:13] <desophos> i did ask in #django, but no responses there. it's pretty difficult to recreate this issue in a self-contained example because it involves django; thanks for the response though
[17:21:38] <robertmaxrees> well, actually, the frontend can be self-contained and separated ;)
[17:21:44] <desophos> the best i could do would be to paste my relevant code, but it's django
[17:22:15] <desophos> hmm, i guess; i'll look at it
[17:30:24] <desophos> robertmaxrees: https://dpaste.de/MBVr
[17:31:10] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle?
[17:33:40] <desophos> well... it works in the fiddle i just set up :p
[17:33:45] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:34:05] <desophos> http://jsfiddle.net/zhf1wmc1/
[17:34:19] <robertmaxrees> mmk.
[17:37:46] <desophos> but like i said: that row.is(':visible') on line 120 returns false when the page is loading, but returns true after the page has loaded
[17:38:12] <robertmaxrees> you need one to happen after the other explicitly.
[17:38:21] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a race condition.
[17:39:11] <robertmaxrees> what's the order?
[17:39:51] <desophos> the order of what?
[17:39:58] <robertmaxrees> that things need to load in?
[17:41:23] <desophos> i guess jqm needs to finish rendering (?) the page and then the formset JS needs to check the formset HTML after that
[17:41:40] <robertmaxrees> okay - then load the formset script AFTER jqm is done.
[17:42:45] <desophos> i currently have my page-specific scripts in div.ui-content
[17:42:54] <robertmaxrees> one sec, let me show you what i mean.
[17:43:00] <desophos> yes please
[17:44:40] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/p77lo90/
[17:44:43] <robertmaxrees> rough idea.
[17:44:47] <robertmaxrees> (that won't work copy/paste)
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> also, don't put script tags in the body of your page like that.  load everything in the head and set it up using event delegation or something similar.
[17:48:07] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/4438019/923919 this will help you a bit, too.
[17:50:42] <desophos> ok, i see
[17:51:48] <desophos> i was going to go with the single .js file, but that requires each page to have a unique id, right? and i'm using django templates to DRY as much as possible, but i can deal with a little repetition
[17:52:28] <robertmaxrees> the unique IDs are a good thing in this case.
[17:52:35] <robertmaxrees> and classes.
[17:52:42] <robertmaxrees> to separate logic from markup.
[19:10:33] <rook_flood> is it possible to trigger an event bound via jQuery (e.g. `$('div').on('mousedown', function(){})`) with methods available natively to the DOM?
[20:46:55] <XVicarious> Two questions about the datepicker:  1)  When I click on the button I use to trigger said datepicker, I have to unfocus it and click it a second time to active it. The previous contents of the function came up right away.  2)  is there a way to have the picker NOT replace the text on the button that triggers it when it is done?
[20:47:33] <robertmaxrees> can you show an example?
[20:48:56] <XVicarious> Yeah give me a second
[20:51:16] <XVicarious> http://xvicario.us/time  Username:test Password:test  Click on "Maurer, Brian"  The button next to Mon 01/05.
[20:51:23] <robertmaxrees> err...
[20:51:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:51:28] <XVicarious> I know lol.
[20:51:38] <robertmaxrees> a self-contained example would be nicer.
[20:51:42] <XVicarious> Oh.
[20:52:37] <robertmaxrees> either way, your first problem sounds like you have the init code in a click handler for that button.
[20:55:25] <XVicarious> Here: http://xvicario.us/time/admin/test.php
[20:55:30] <XVicarious> Oh
[20:55:42] <XVicarious> Well i mean it worked perfectly for the dialogs
[20:56:09] <robertmaxrees> err.
[20:56:16] <robertmaxrees> dialogs and datepickers are different.
[20:56:59] <XVicarious> Okay, I suppose.  So I just move said datepicker out and then do a show it?
[20:57:14] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[20:57:28] <robertmaxrees> as far as the changing text, i'd have to hit up the api docs.
[20:57:44] <XVicarious> Okay, let me figure out this first part.
[20:58:07] <robertmaxrees> $('.newDate').datepicker({
[20:58:35] <robertmaxrees> oh actually, $('.newDat').each(function() { /* old code here */ });
[20:58:49] <robertmaxrees> instead of the click event.
[21:00:07] <robertmaxrees> *click event handler
[21:01:33] <XVicarious> The .newDate are made by Ajax, and I found that unless you use $(document).on it won't work.
[21:01:50] <robertmaxrees> wat.
[21:02:10] <robertmaxrees> ah, i see why.
[21:02:14] <XVicarious> Okay.
[21:02:18] <robertmaxrees> don;t use an event binding for that part either way.
[21:03:27] <XVicarious> So how could I work around it then? because I tried it on the real page and $('.newDate').each doesn't work.
[21:03:43] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[21:03:50] <XVicarious> No.
[21:03:54] <robertmaxrees> also: why ajax for that data?
[21:04:24] <robertmaxrees> ah posting it.
[21:04:25] <robertmaxrees> i get it.
[21:04:28] <XVicarious> Yes.
[21:04:48] <robertmaxrees> $('.newDate').each() should work there.  could you pull out the relevant bits into a jsfiddle?
[21:05:27] <XVicarious> I'm not sure.  It works with a local database.
[21:05:35] <robertmaxrees> the ajax part doesn't matter.
[21:05:42] <XVicarious> Okay
[21:06:22] <robertmaxrees> and btw you have invalid attributes on some elements.
[21:06:27] <XVicarious> i mean, it all works if the button ISN'T ajax.  The example page I posted */test.php worked with your thing
[21:06:44] <XVicarious> but the ajax'd data did't.
[21:06:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[21:07:20] <robertmaxrees> an .each() instead of that event binding should basically do the trick.
[21:08:00] <XVicarious> But it isn't working with the button that was made from the pulled in AJAX data.
[21:08:10] <XVicarious> It worked otherwise.
[21:08:32] <robertmaxrees> where are you generating a button with AJAX?
[21:08:43] <robertmaxrees> because i'm not going to read through all of your JS>
[21:09:15] <robertmaxrees> i gotta ditch out soon, but you can't init that in an event binding like that
[21:09:19] <robertmaxrees> init on pageload instead.
[21:09:28] <XVicarious> Lines 13 - 29, from the file masterTime.php
[21:10:00] <robertmaxrees> and you'll need to manually open the datepicker, instead of using the defaults to take care of your second issue.
[21:10:01] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[21:52:51] <Valduare> hey guys - is there a way to make a bootstrap dropdown button  operate as  form select
[22:02:17] <Valduare> is there a way I can do that?
[22:21:35] <Philip> hey is there any way to add the value to the array
[22:21:59] <Philip> var c = $scope.updatedChild;
[22:22:15] <Philip> $scope.callflowJson[length].c = voicemailJson;
[22:22:38] <Philip> it's add the the c but i want to add  only c value
[22:28:57] <renzyyy> scope.callflowJson[length][c]
[22:34:01] <Philip> hey renzyyy
[22:34:13] <renzyyy> hey
[22:34:25] <Philip> that's my code
[22:34:27] <Philip> $scope.callflowJson[length].children._.children._.children._
[22:34:48] <Philip> i put the value in c  c = .children._
[22:35:07] <Philip> when first time i call it's return  c = .children._
[22:35:22] <Philip> and on secone time c= .children._.children._
[22:36:00] <stompdaroach> i feel dizzy
[23:59:23] <daylum> hey. when having the first argument both as a way to specify enhancements to the default configuration and as a way to execute commands ("show", "hide", "close", just as in jQM), is there some special unusual pattern required to accomplish that?
[23:59:51] <daylum> other than checking if arguments[0] isPlainObject or not
