[04:13:41] <jsdoodl> If I havent click anything I want be able to check ALL in same table --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/103/
[04:15:03] <jsdoodl> If I check "white", "blue" , then I want to also check "yellow"
[04:15:55] <jsdoodl> so If all checkboxes is empty let me check "one row" full
[04:47:21] <latemus> my ShowFeed function is displaying erratic results. see the section '// READ VIEW' at termbin.com/exo2
[04:47:35] <latemus> almost like a race condition
[04:47:51] <latemus> but fails to display all but one or two records at most
[04:59:24] <jsdoodl> someone know =) ?
[05:03:20] <FilipNortic_> latemus: if you have serveral ajax request and the order of callbacks matters then you'll have racy code unless you handle it
[05:29:34] <jsdoodl> hi , someone know how to get this working :) -> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/103/
[05:46:25] <schiu> hi all. noob question: what would be the selector for the input field #options_7_text when I can use only the class .unitprice and not the dynamically created "options-7" stuff https://pastebin.com/knWYWS5h
[05:51:59] <rapha> hi!
[05:52:26] <rapha> given https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/256ab69261cb55e9390bc8cad6f50435, why do i see the alert(), but the preventDefault() doesn't prevent the link from being followed?
[05:55:20] <jsdoodl> how to allow to only filter each other in same box --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/105/
[05:55:28] <jsdoodl> to not*
[05:57:08] <Uhkis> jsdoodl: just use radiobuttons instead
[05:58:09] <latemus> FilipNortic_: thank you
[05:58:18] <jsdoodl> Uhkis: but in this one --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/104/          ... I want to able to check every one in same box if the others is not checked
[06:01:45] <jsdoodl> Uhkis: oh, this one --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/107/
[06:02:19] <jsdoodl> Uhkis: if I wanna check,  "bike"  "car"  "bus" , I cant
[06:03:57] <Uhkis> jsdoodl: maybe add a class or id to separate those filters?
[06:06:35] <jsdoodl> Uhkis: how ?
[06:07:09] <Uhkis> <fieldset class="filter-grp" id="colorfilter">
[06:07:40] <jsdoodl> Uhkis: yes, how do you mean by filter it up then?
[06:12:58] <Uhkis> jsdoodl: huh?
[06:14:20] <jsdoodl> Uhkis : now I have color- , car- and size- filter --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/108/
[06:15:05] <jsdoodl> so If only color is checked, I want be able to check all in color
[06:15:20] <jsdoodl> right now, color is filtering itself
[06:15:27] <rapha> What reason could there be for preventDefault() to work in https://jsfiddle.net/c0pp1npo/10/, but not on my actual project? (Don't know how to debug it since it works fine in the fiddle)
[06:19:30] <Uhkis> jsdoodl: http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/109/ something like that
[06:20:27] <Uhkis> rapha: maybe there's an earlier eventhandler
[06:22:43] <jsdoodl> what did you do? =)
[06:23:45] <Uhkis> jsdoodl: change the handler to use fieldsets instead, add that id if on #21
[06:24:01] <jsdoodl> Uhkis: Can I do same with all fieldsets (carfilter and sizefilter too)
[06:24:38] <Uhkis> jsdoodl: of course
[06:26:07] <jsdoodl> Uhkis _ if ($(this).parents('fieldset').attr('id') != 'colorfilter' || 'carfilter' || 'sizefilter' )
[06:26:23] <rapha> Uhkis: i do see the alert() ... so the event is being handled. it's just that the preventDefault() has no effect.
[06:26:38] <Uhkis> jsdoodl: that's not the correct syntax
[06:26:56] <jsdoodl> || or ?
[06:27:04] <jsdoodl> or which one is failing
[06:27:34] <Uhkis> you always need to compare to that $(this).parents('fieldset').attr('id')
[06:29:59] <jsdoodl> Uhkis --> like this http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/110/
[06:33:26] <jsdoodl> Uhkis isnt that right syntax?
[06:33:28] <jsdoodl>  || fieldsetID != 'sizefilter'
[06:33:34] <jsdoodl> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/111/
[06:34:05] <Uhkis> jsdoodl: yes, but i think you need a lot more than that to make it work
[06:36:21] <jsdoodl> Uhkis the check I need to do is:  if checkbox is checked in this fieldset and not in any other fieldsets, make this thing you did else not
[06:37:16] <Uhkis> jsdoodl: so start writing it :P
[06:37:29] <jsdoodl> yeap :P
[06:47:46] <jsdoodl> Uhkis: shouldnt it be same result if I change  ---> (fieldsetID != 'colorfilter') ?
[06:47:52] <jsdoodl> to if (fieldsetID != fieldsetID)
[06:49:35] <Uhkis> that would never go into the true block
[06:50:53] <Uhkis> it was just an example, you need something like if (fieldsetId == 'colorfilter') { do this } else if (fieldsetId == 'otherfilter') { do this }
[09:22:39] <jsdoodl> Hi how to filter not on itselfs --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/111/
[09:23:28] <jsdoodl> so I can check "white    blue    yellow "
[09:51:06] <latemus> can you chain seletors, as in the following: [ref="task"].myClass
[09:51:30] <AdamPDotty> first: yes
[09:51:43] <AdamPDotty> second: possibly have to do it the other way around
[09:51:51] <latemus> okay
[09:51:56] <latemus> :) thanks
[09:51:59] <AdamPDotty> so class first
[09:52:07] <latemus> ok. how do i delimit them
[09:52:17] <latemus> no space?
[09:52:25] <Cork> space means separate elements
[09:52:27] <AdamPDotty> right, same element then no space
[09:52:33] <latemus> ok kk
[09:52:36] <latemus> cool
[09:52:39] <Cork> [ ] . # are selector separators
[09:53:17] <Cork> (oh, and :)
[09:53:34] <latemus> ok. so .myClass[ref="task"] will match an element having BOTH the class .myClass AND an attribute called ref which has the value task?
[09:53:43] <Cork> yes
[09:53:50] <latemus> perfect! thanks
[09:53:52] <latemus> both of you
[09:53:58] <Cork> or [ref="task"].myClass
[09:54:01] <Cork> they are identical
[09:54:07] <latemus> ok
[09:54:20] <AdamPDotty> ok, have not yet seen the later version, so I was not sure, it works too
[09:55:19] <Cork> feels weird but you can do .myClass[rel="task"]div
[09:55:35] <Cork> though you commonly type it as div[rel="task"].myClass
[10:18:58] <AdamPDotty> now he left
[10:19:07] <AdamPDotty> anyway jsdoodl: http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/113/
[10:23:41] <AdamPDotty> Is there a bot around to leave a message?
[10:30:03] <Cork> no, not anymore
[10:30:18] <Cork> there used to be a bot in here but its dead since long ago
[10:41:51] <Uhkis> RIP
[14:07:21] <jsdoodl> Hi,, I have made a filter that works nearly like I want :) have one thing left I hope someone can help me with
[14:07:30] <jsdoodl> here is the link --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/115/
[14:08:41] <jsdoodl> My problem: If I know check in box "COLOR", I can check all
[14:09:11] <jsdoodl> but there is no results, how can I get results, any ideas?
[14:11:01] <jsdoodl> robertmaxrees: Do you know a good solution for my jquery code
[14:11:35] <robertmaxrees> i didn't see your question.
[14:12:03] <jsdoodl> ok, its cool =) can explain it again
[14:12:09] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:12:13] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle or something?
[14:12:20] <jsdoodl> yes http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/115/
[14:13:11] <jsdoodl> it almost done, the last part is : If I just check one of boxes full I dont get any results.
[14:13:44] <jsdoodl> for example, do I only check the box "COLOR", I want to have results on all colors been clicked
[14:14:07] <robertmaxrees> right, you want everything that contains white OR blue OR yellow
[14:14:26] <Proteus^> jsdoodl, your problem is that your white blue bus small element does not contain the class blue
[14:14:41] <jsdoodl> yes, and same if I only click "vehicle" or " Size"
[14:15:59] <Proteus^> you have this <li class="white bus small">white blue bus small</li>
[14:16:10] <Proteus^> so when you check blue and it filters by blue then it removes that result
[14:16:10] <robertmaxrees> Proteus^ that's not the issue he's having :)
[14:16:16] <jsdoodl> oh, that text failes :P fixed --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/116/
[14:16:26] <jsdoodl> Proteus^
[14:16:51] <robertmaxrees> jsdoodl your $.each on selectedClasses seems suspect.,
[14:16:52] <jsdoodl> this one http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/117/
[14:17:39] <jsdoodl> robertmaxrees: I did get some help with that one, so that maybe correct
[14:17:52] <robertmaxrees> think abnout what it's doing.
[14:17:53] <Proteus^> what functionality are you wanting it to do?
[14:18:25] <robertmaxrees> Proteus^ he wasn't it to match inclusively, so when he check white AND blue, he wants everything with white OR blue
[14:19:04] <robertmaxrees> *wants it to
[14:19:23] <robertmaxrees> jsdoodl so walk through that each - do you see the issue there?
[14:19:48] <robertmaxrees> also: if (selectedClasses) { is a bad test.
[14:19:53] <robertmaxrees> empty arrays are truthy.
[14:19:58] <jsdoodl> Proteus^ : for example: If I only check 1 box full (Color) and not the others boxes (Vehicle: Size:) I want color to filter
[14:19:59] <robertmaxrees> you want if (selectedClasses.length) {
[14:21:22] <jsdoodl> robertmaxrees tried that, but didnt work
[14:21:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:21:42] <robertmaxrees> works fine here.
[14:22:10] <robertmaxrees> either way, i'd change that $.each to instead be a filter - for each element split the class into an array, use .some() to test those classes against the selectedClasses.
[14:22:12] <robertmaxrees> boom done.
[14:23:35] <jsdoodl> http://imgur.com/a/QMFGg
[14:23:54] <robertmaxrees> right?
[14:24:00] <robertmaxrees> i just told you how to fix that.
[14:24:30] <robertmaxrees> the .length thing was because your current test is faulty.
[14:24:38] <robertmaxrees> also technically unnecessary.
[14:24:46] <jsdoodl> ok, I just changed the lenght
[14:24:53] <jsdoodl> do you have jsfiddle on that one
[14:24:59] <robertmaxrees> on what one?
[14:25:03] <Proteus^> here is a quick way to do it without modifying much http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/120/
[14:25:04] <robertmaxrees> my suggestion on how to fix?
[14:25:16] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:25:54] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[14:26:01] <Proteus^> =D
[14:26:23] <robertmaxrees> heh, preferable to not hand out solutions
[14:26:35] <robertmaxrees> let him figure it out ;)
[14:26:53] <jsdoodl> phone was ringing :P im back
[14:27:35] <jsdoodl> Proteus^ your fiddle didnt work ?
[14:28:06] <Proteus^> works on my machine :)  maybe forgot a var if your browser is picky :)
[14:28:21] <jsdoodl> got chrome
[14:29:17] <jsdoodl> Proteus^ I can check all in same box, but if I click in another box it doesnt filter
[14:29:54] <Proteus^> you're close, meeting time!
[14:30:19] <jsdoodl> nah :P
[14:31:34] <robertmaxrees> cripes internet
[14:32:04] <jsdoodl> robertmaxrees I will try your solution. Is it $.each i should add
[14:32:06] <jsdoodl> ok :S
[14:33:04] <robertmaxrees> the other dude gave you a solution that's basically what i was suggesting.
[14:33:28] <jsdoodl> he gave me this one --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/120/
[14:33:33] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:33:40] <robertmaxrees> very similar to my suggestion.
[14:34:28] <jsdoodl> now I can click all checkboxes in filter, example "Color"
[14:34:55] <jsdoodl> but if I want to check all colors and then filter on bus, nothting happens
[14:35:14] <robertmaxrees> do you want any bus with any of those colors?
[14:36:40] <jsdoodl> robertmaxrees yes, if I click all colors and bus, it should give me = white bus
[14:37:05] <robertmaxrees> then you need to categorize your selections and get more complex.
[14:38:40] <jsdoodl> but this works like I want, but only not show any results when I click a full "box" http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/117/
[14:39:54] <jsdoodl> I dont want to filter if just one box is checked
[14:40:50] <jsdoodl> if only Color or Vehicle or Size checkbox all = checked , then dont filter
[14:41:32] <jsdoodl> only filter if a checkbox is checked in two or more different boxes/categorys
[14:49:28] <taplar> sounds like you know what your logic should look like
[14:54:47] <jsdoodl> taplar: yes, i feeling close, but really need some help :(
[14:54:52] <jsdoodl> im*
[15:55:18] <Proteus^> jsdoodl, here is a non complete example that should get you in the right direction.  http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/123/
[15:56:04] <Proteus^> the if selectedcolors should be a function that you can pass various arrays to and i did not implement size.  I also did not mess with your disable checkbox logic which would require some work as well.
[15:56:08] <jsdoodl> Proteus^ oh man, thats awesome :D
[15:56:28] <Proteus^> :)
[15:56:29] <jsdoodl> save my day :P
[15:56:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:57:11] <jsdoodl> its true! :D
[15:57:24] <Proteus^> just know i hacked that together in about 2 minutes, you should properly format it and create that function like i mentioned :)
[15:57:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:59:07] <ELektroBug>         }
[16:00:15] <robertmaxrees>          {
[16:00:26] <Proteus^> }
[16:01:17] <jsdoodl> Proteus^ ok, there is some code left I see :P
[16:01:24] <Proteus^> :)
[16:02:48] <jsdoodl> sizes seems not to have any hacks :P
[16:05:10] <Proteus^> generally copy/paste code several times is bad :)  should just be a function that takes a parameter
[16:05:34] <taplar> crazy talk
[16:05:56] <taplar> that defeats job security
[16:06:04] <Proteus^> lol
[16:06:37] <jsdoodl> I copied your selectedCar to do a selectedSizes, but can sort from sizes (all checked) to cars
[16:06:43] <jsdoodl> update v. http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/124/
[16:07:22] <jsdoodl> *not
[16:20:06] <Rasec8me> hi
[16:20:17] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[16:22:01] <jsdoodl> Proteus^ : you have some syntax error on that fiddle you send me, if u check console it says something about "."
[16:22:30] <poboy> Is anyone familiar with flot?  This is new to me and I'm just trying to make a line chart that compares 5 sets of data
[16:22:48] <robertmaxrees> jsdoodl he said it wasn't done :)
[16:23:02] <robertmaxrees> just to give you an idea of what to do?
[16:23:05] <robertmaxrees> *.
[16:23:15] <Proteus^> ^
[16:23:45] <jsdoodl> isnt this type of filter "standard".?
[16:24:03] <jsdoodl> It should been done before,
[16:24:25] <Proteus^> everythings been done before :)
[16:27:07] <Rasec8Me> Hola
[16:27:12] <robertmaxrees> hello
[16:27:36] <Proteus^> well good bye?
[16:27:55] <robertmaxrees> that's the second time they've done that.
[16:28:09] <jsdoodl> you know any good sites for javascripts codes?
[16:28:28] <robertmaxrees> jsdoodl copy/paste isn't really a sustainable solution.
[16:28:32] <jsdoodl> where I can search and use a script? like bootstrap
[16:29:06] <da_wunder> jsdoodl: google ?
[16:29:34] <jsdoodl> da_wunder: have googled this for 2 days .. nothing founded
[16:29:43] <robertmaxrees> jsdoodl what have you searched for?
[16:29:50] <da_wunder> jsdoodl: what are your searching ?
[16:30:22] <jsdoodl> a lot with --> filter jqery checkbox
[16:30:26] <jsdoodl> jquery*
[16:30:31] <robertmaxrees> eh./
[16:30:31] <Proteus^> my going contract rate is $100 an hour.  I dont mean to be rude but i've given you everything you need to solve your problem lol
[16:30:42] <Proteus^> short of doing it all fo ryou
[16:30:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:30:57] <robertmaxrees> jsdoodl try tinysort maybe?
[16:30:59] <robertmaxrees> that might help.
[16:31:15] <da_wunder> jsdoodl: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8796472/filtering-with-checkboxes-using-jquery ?
[16:31:28] <robertmaxrees> the issue is his filtering is semi-complex
[16:31:42] <robertmaxrees> he wants inclusive within the same group, but exclusive between groupos.
[16:31:46] <robertmaxrees> *groups
[16:32:07] <Proteus^> and i wrote it for him 75% of the way done lol
[16:32:17] <robertmaxrees> copy/paste programming :)
[16:32:32] <jsdoodl> yes, it a bit complex for me, Im just a beginner
[16:32:34] <da_wunder> so in backend side WHERE soemid IN(12,34,56...)
[16:32:42] <robertmaxrees> he wants it in the UI ;)_
[16:32:55] <jsdoodl> I really preciate it robertmaxrees, thats true! =)
[16:33:14] <robertmaxrees> though he could expose an ajax endpoint and run it that way but i'm going to guess that's a little complex for where he's at.
[16:33:33] <da_wunder> imho that is simpler one
[16:33:42] <Proteus^> jsdoodl, look at the differeences between the last two examples i gave ya.  If you can figure out why i did that you can solve the problem
[16:34:34] <jsdoodl> Proteus^ : ok, in this one --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/124/
[16:34:42] <robertmaxrees> da_wunder sure, but he likely has no context for how to set those things up :)
[16:34:52] <da_wunder> hmm and btw how is this related to "23:28 < jsdoodl> you know any good sites for javascripts codes?"
[16:36:22] <robertmaxrees> he's looking for a copy/paste solution :)
[16:38:07] <da_wunder> ok, that explains
[16:38:38] <jsdoodl> robermaxrees: this is a bit complex, and I just know the basics in jqery, so yes, a copy/paste or something like that
[16:39:01] <nickdavis> How can I iterate over Object {3: 54, 528: 33, 537: 225, 548: 54, 561: 338, 562: 146}
[16:39:02] <taplar> not really the purpose of this room man
[16:39:05] <robertmaxrees> jsdoodl i can see why you think you want that, but it's a bad idea.
[16:39:11] <taplar> it's a teaching room
[16:39:17] <robertmaxrees> nickdavis trhat's a really strange object.
[16:39:34] <robertmaxrees> but you can use a for in loop.  though I'd question the format of it to begin with.
[16:40:08] <nickdavis> I'm trying to create an object of Rows / Columns that contain mines in minesweeper
[16:40:18] <nickdavis> and I can't think of an efficient way to do it.
[16:40:28] <robertmaxrees> nickdavis are those supposed to be x/y coords?
[16:40:36] <taplar> [ { row: #, col: #} ]
[16:40:42] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[16:40:46] <robertmaxrees> what i was about to get at.
[16:40:53] <robertmaxrees> then it's just a clean forEach
[16:41:32] <taplar> and more self documenting
[16:41:35] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[16:41:53] <nickdavis> I'm assuming I would need to create my own object type for that?
[16:42:02] <robertmaxrees> it'
[16:42:08] <robertmaxrees> *it's just an array of object.
[16:42:16] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean by your question.
[16:42:40] <nickdavis> Oh see yep np
[16:43:08] <robertmaxrees> using an object whose keys are a piece of data is awkward :)
[16:43:26] <robertmaxrees> also you limit the ability to have, say, 2 things on the same axis.
[16:43:33] <Proteus^> nickdavis, for your object you need a for in loop with hasownproperty
[16:43:45] <robertmaxrees> but his loop isn't sustainable at all.
[16:43:49] <robertmaxrees> *object
[16:44:10] <taplar> you can make a poor solution work, or make a better solution
[16:44:24] <robertmaxrees> and you can still use forEach with objects.  just a little awkward.
[16:46:46] <Proteus^> https://pastebin.com/8Xe8i3HN
[16:47:11] <robertmaxrees> heh i wouldn't do that bug (shrug)
[16:47:16] <robertmaxrees> *but
[16:47:28] <robertmaxrees> for var obj will get hoisted to the top of the current scope.
[16:51:00] <Proteus^> true enough :)

[23:06:46] <latemus> i need to use $.post to send form data to my api as JSON. .serialize() and .serializeArray() produce identical query-format strings, which i can confirm using an intercepting proxy to view the post request in transit. How can i convert a query-string to a json object containing pairs?
[23:07:57] <latemus> Shall i manually build the object by iteration on the query-string or does jquery provide a method for this?
