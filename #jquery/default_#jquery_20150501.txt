[00:59:51] <unnu> I hate wordpress still
[01:08:19] <unnu> quick question: would $('input[data-bogus="blah"]) be a valid selector?

[01:22:13] <HarryMilnes> Hello, I'm using JQueryUI and the Overlay seems to be overlapping the ui-dialog, is there anyway to fix this?
[01:22:33] <HarryMilnes> I've had so such luck using CSS
[01:46:39] <JosefDe> Hey guys. I'm using fineuploader's jquery plugin. The problem is: In Safari, as soon as I click a button, the file select menu occurs. But in Firefox, no file select menu occurs, instead   a new page is loaded. How can I fix this  bug?
[01:52:35] <krambiorix> how can i propose the user to install an extension in Firefox?
[02:12:53] <joris> Hi. My .val() calls inside a change() event appear to be taking the before-change values of input fields. Any ideas?
[02:15:47] <Guest11596> #html is dying
[02:15:49] <Guest11596> it's not good
[02:16:10] <arthurvr> joris: do you have a fiddle/jsbin?
[02:16:15] <joris> arthurvr: http://pastie.org/private/d4mcbuugajebzg9jbz37mg
[02:16:45] <arthurvr> joris: that’s just a paste of your code, a *reduced* testcase would be nice.
[02:17:00] <arthurvr> just to make sure it’s a problem with .val() and not with anything else :-)
[02:17:09] <arthurvr> and to make it as simple as possible to debug
[02:17:21] <HarryMilnes> Can someone help me with JQueryUI ?
[02:17:36] <arthurvr> `ask @ HarryMilnes
[02:17:37] <b-ot> HarryMilnes: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:18:03] <HarryMilnes> The ui-overlay is overlapping my ui-dialog, I'm not sure how to fix it so the dialog shows ontop properly
[02:18:08] <HarryMilnes> I've had no luck when using CSS
[02:18:22] <arthurvr> HarryMilnes: same to you, maybe try to create a fiddle?
[02:18:25] <joris> arthurvr: I'll try to reduce it
[02:18:30] <arthurvr> awesome
[02:20:30] <HarryMilnes> Got it, I'm sorry to bother you guys
[02:26:28] <joris> arthurvr: Found the problem while reducing, as you may have guessed. Thanks for your trouble.
[04:21:48] <Crucials> any obvious reason why my $(element).scrollLeft(int) doesnt work :(
[05:02:58] <pi-> Can I condense `document.querySelector('#volume').value = vol;` using JQuery?
[05:03:27] <pi-> `$('#volume').value = vol;` doesn't work.
[05:04:36] <decx> when you wrap an element with $() it has its own methods and properties attached to it
[05:04:44] <decx> for value that's val()
[05:04:49] <decx> as a getter and setter
[05:07:49] <pi-> Thanks
[05:08:34] <pi-> https://gist.github.com/p-i-/845d5e19723e190dd28c <-- this is what I've got now.  Is it possible to improve this code, something like what I'm trying on line 13?
[05:09:21] <decx> yeah here you're mixing that up again
[05:09:31] <decx> you want to use http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:09:43] <decx> for any kind of event handler
[05:16:05] <pi-> $('#density').on( 'input',  function(x) {$('#volumeLabel').val(x)} ); // sets volumeLabel to "[object Object]"
[05:16:49] <pi-> I can't see what's going on here..
[05:18:28] <bepolite> pi-: x is the event object i think
[05:18:58] <bepolite> pi-:  Try $('#density').on( 'input',  function(x) { console.log(x)} );
[05:19:15] <decx> with a range slider you want change instead of input
[05:21:55] <pi-> Aha, yes! /s/x/x.target.value fixes: $('#densitySlider').on( 'input',  function(x) {$('#densityLabel').val(x.target.value)} );
[05:22:45] <pi-> decx: they both seem to do the same thing. Neither of them catch the initial value which is a pity.
[05:23:02] <decx> what are you doing anyway?
[05:23:09] <pi-> It seems to negate the benefit of my above one-liner, as I need to specifically set the initial value.
[05:24:21] <pi-> Just making a slider for controlling a parameter in an music demo (average number of random notes generated per second)
[05:26:11] <unnu> hey guys, just wanna get some general opinions, if you have a tooltip for a desktop browser view of a page, what is the "best" way to to display that information on mobile?
[05:26:43] <unnu> i know there is no best way, hence the quotes . . . just looking for some ideas on how to show the data for mobile users.
[05:29:11] <pi-> https://gist.github.com/p-i-/7ee3e06033fd31b89623 <-- the only remaining problem is that I need to change the slider in order for the label to show the value. Is there a clean fix?
[05:31:33] <pi-> i.e. When the page initially loads, the label doesn't display anything. It seems a pity to meet that the `change` event doesn't trigger on load. Because that is a change!
[05:31:52] <pi-> ^/s/meet/me
[05:32:55] <decx> add .trigger('change')
[05:32:58] <sammich> ^
[05:34:15] <pi-> Splendid!
[05:55:00] <LAN_Lord> General question for you jquery folks
[05:55:31] <LAN_Lord> I have a table ..... its about 4,000 rows.  I have it in a scrollable box on the page.
[05:55:54] <LAN_Lord> I want the headers to stay in place when you scroll down.  Any ideas where to start?
[05:56:23] <LAN_Lord> JS? PHP? can HTML alone do this?  The only thing that comes to mind for ME ... is a z-index of sorts ... which .... yeahhh
[05:57:01] <robmal> datatables.net
[05:58:13] <decx> on scroll you save the y position and compare that to the y position of your table header, if it's bigger then you change the headers to css position: fixed
[05:59:05] <LAN_Lord> Cool!!  Thanks folks.  Quick and easy.  I'll give datatables.net a try and CSS fixes you recommended.
[05:59:14] <LAN_Lord> Should be a good start.
[05:59:38] <LAN_Lord> I also see there is a css channel here on Freenode :D
[08:10:39] <cyberbrai> 	http://jsfiddle.net/9Ymvt/3512/ is there any function in factory method when i cann my create button so it can append the new input box
[08:14:55] <cyberbrai> any help
[08:57:51] <monk3y> Hey folks.  Anyone know of a good source (or the right search-terms) to find dynamic menus with sub-menu items, that can be dynamically modified or highlighted based on a search-term?  Similar strategy to OSX and Win control-panel UIs.  You type in a term, and they focus on item(s) that relate to the term.  Basic example using jQuery: I'd want to type a term, and highlight the menu items that
[08:57:51] <monk3y> contain that word.
[09:04:57] <Uhkis> like chosen?
[09:08:07] <monk3y> Uhkis: didn't know about that but just checked it out.  Similar idea, yeah, but not for selects/drop-downs - for menus with sub-menu items.
[09:08:34] <monk3y> Uhkis: so not to remove invalid sub-menu items etc, but more to highlight menu & sub-menu items that contain or relate to the search-term.
[09:09:21] <monk3y> This is for complex/comprehensive menus where you simply can't have too many wordy sub-menu items, so to help the user, they can type their search-phrase and be guided a little.
[09:15:27] <Uhkis> well you could just get the names and use chosen for it
[09:26:58] <monk3y> Uhkis: yeah sounds viable.
[10:09:03] <robertmaxrees> gooooood morning #jquery!
[10:16:18] <Uhkis> evening robertmaxrees
[10:34:33] <brettfrable> anyone here use mCustomScrollbar before?
[10:34:42] <robertmaxrees> you know what i'ma tell you mang :)
[10:40:12] <Lencl> hey ^^
[10:40:22] <Lencl> http://76.79.253.139//~midev1/miwebsite/index.php
[10:40:47] <Lencl> if you click on Edit Right column , it comes out quick... then after that, click Edit left column
[10:40:53] <Lencl> why would it be slower???
[11:24:31] <kevireilly> felipedvorak: figure it out?
[12:07:35] <weaksauce> anyone have trouble with numbers in function names when dealing with google maps, jquery addresspicker and jquery autocomplete?
[12:08:00] <robertmaxrees> that's an awfull strange question.
[12:08:09] <weaksauce> it's a perplexing problem
[12:08:29] <weaksauce> google maps doesn't work if the id's and functions have a number inside it
[12:08:51] <robertmaxrees> contain a number, or start with a number?
[12:09:10] <weaksauce> contain
[12:09:25] <weaksauce> location123_map vs. location_map
[12:10:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see an example to explore why.
[12:10:34] <robertmaxrees> though i can't think of a case where I'd actually want my functions to have numbers in their names.
[12:10:58] <cleopatra> :P
[12:11:05] <weaksauce> the idea was to pass in an object id to have multiple maps on the same page and just dynamically generate the javascript on the backend
[12:11:17] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:11:21] <weaksauce> it's not awesome code
[12:11:25] <weaksauce> don't get me wrong
[12:11:28] <robertmaxrees> avoid generating code like that.\
[12:13:18] <weaksauce> usually do yeah.
[12:19:37] <felipedvorak> kevireilly: Nope... I just can't understand it... sometimes I think giving up is the only solution :D
[12:26:10] <zeroquake> is there a difference between $([]) and [] ?
[12:37:38] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:38:06] <zeroquake> what do i search for to find more information about this
[12:38:49] <robertmaxrees> let's back up real quick - what got you to that question?
[12:39:10] <zeroquake> i see it being used in a plugin
[12:39:28] <zeroquake> var x = $([])
[12:39:57] <robertmaxrees> what plugin?
[12:40:44] <zeroquake> https://github.com/nkmrshn/fixedTblHdrLftCol/blob/master/jquery.fixedTblHdrLftCol.js  line 81,84
[12:41:33] <sergez> hi
[12:42:53] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake that's a really bizarre pattern.
[12:43:14] <robertmaxrees> they're basically creating an array-like jquery objkect that they can push elements into.
[12:43:27] <zeroquake> but why jquery object?
[12:43:29] <robertmaxrees> it's likely because they're not aware of .add() or they're afraid of some overhead.
[12:43:41] <robertmaxrees> check out getFixedHeadHeight
[12:43:45] <sergez> does anybody still use mootools?
[12:44:04] <robertmaxrees> in that function, they do var rows = getHeadFirstRows(table);, and that function does a similar pattern.
[12:44:13] <robertmaxrees> sergez some people do.
[12:44:17] <robertmaxrees> not many i'd guess.
[12:45:13] <zeroquake> creating a jquery object means , all jquery methods are accessable to that arrAY?
[12:45:20] <robertmaxrees> sort of, yeah.
[12:45:26] <robertmaxrees> it's a really unusual way to do it.
[12:45:37] <robertmaxrees> basically, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-elementArray is what they're doing.
[12:46:07] <Lencl> anyone know about jquery mobile panels?
[12:46:19] <sergez> I do Lencl
[12:46:20] <robertmaxrees> Lencl lots of peopl do, i'm sure.
[12:46:28] <Lencl> oh ok
[12:46:35] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, just ask :)
[12:46:48] <Lencl> I increased the panel width... but the click area isn't recognized
[12:47:05] <Lencl> here's what I mean
[12:47:06] <Lencl> http://76.79.253.139//~midev1/miwebsite/index.php
[12:47:11] <zeroquake> i think he did that to use jquery .each method on the array
[12:47:22] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake it's an array of dom elements.
[12:47:26] <robertmaxrees> look at the documentation i linked you.
[12:47:37] <Lencl> Click on the left panel then try to click on the text box from the far right of it
[12:47:51] <Lencl> it acts as if it I clicked outside the panel
[12:48:01] <zeroquake> yup , thank you , going thru it
[12:48:57] <robertmaxrees> Lencl you probably need to override the styles for ui-panel-dismiss
[12:49:04] <robertmaxrees> or .ui-panel-dismiss-open.ui-panel-dismiss-position-left rather
[12:49:06] <Lencl> oh I see
[12:49:17] <robertmaxrees> your dev tools can tell you a lot ;)
[12:58:41] <tw2113> it's like they have purpose
[12:58:56] <robertmaxrees> haha
[13:44:33] <joy4u> i am using jquery validator and getting Cannot read property 'settings' of undefined in console what can be the reason for that
[14:04:18] <joy4u> can anyone have any clue why this error occurs?
[14:05:38] <joy4u> i am using jquery validator and getting Cannot read property 'settings' of undefined in console what can be the reason for that
[14:10:21] <Zzaichik> sounds like it's not recognizing the element id/classname
[14:12:23] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:12:56] <Azrael_-> i'm using jquery.datatables with a table as data source. how can i set the column names? is it possible to be done in the html code?
[15:35:28] <Azrael_-> what is the better approach? select objects based on class and .eq to get a specific one or use ".myclass:nth-child(index)" ?
[15:35:37] <robertmaxrees> the former.
[15:35:39] <robertmaxrees> .eq()
[15:35:44] <Azrael_-> ok, thanks
[15:36:01] <Azrael_-> does eq use the same index as nth-child or is it one less?
[15:36:17] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[15:36:23] <Azrael_-> k
[15:36:29] <robertmaxrees> "An integer indicating the 0-based position of the element. "
[15:37:19] <Azrael_-> thanks
[16:16:52] <sadtaco> how can I extend the dom manipulation of jQuery?  When I append, insertAfter, prepend, html, etc any html, I want to do something along side it.
[16:17:07] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[16:17:53] <sadtaco> Like when I .append('<span class="foo">bar</span>'); I want to change the text of span.foo to match some property.
[16:18:15] <robertmaxrees> you could write your own plugin to do that instead.
[16:18:24] <robertmaxrees> but it sounds like waht you really want is a templating setup.
[16:18:30] <sadtaco> Yes. That's what I want to do but I'm not sure where to start. Where do I extend jQueries dom manipulation?
[16:18:35] <sadtaco> eh.
[16:18:39] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that.
[16:19:28] <sadtaco> Right now I have listeners that find a class and change its property to match the properties when those properties change.  But when I want to add a new element after a property is already set, with dynamic keys, well I can't unless I can see every time html is added
[16:19:47] <sadtaco> I don't like the way Reactjs templating works.
[16:20:09] <robertmaxrees> this smells to me.
[16:20:27] <robertmaxrees> you can write your own appendWithChange(), but that seems really awkward.
[16:21:49] <sadtaco> Yeah... no because like I said, it needs to work for every jQuery function that manipulates html.
[16:21:57] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea.
[16:22:01] <sadtaco> .... why?
[16:22:05] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't replace the basic jquery functions like tht.
[16:22:06] <robertmaxrees> *that
[16:22:15] <sadtaco> I would though.
[16:22:22] <robertmaxrees> then write your own lib.
[16:22:23] <sadtaco> All I'm doing is adding something on top of them.
[16:22:28] <robertmaxrees> you'll end up confusing the hell out of others.
[16:22:56] <robertmaxrees> and yourself.
[16:23:03] <sadtaco> I don't see how it's different than any other plugin that extends a jquery function to add some extra functionality without changing how it actually behaves normally
[16:23:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out a templating library of some kind and go with that instad.
[16:23:58] <robertmaxrees> that really sounds like what you want.  otherwise, check out api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/
[16:24:03] <sadtaco> Can't you just tell me if there is some core function there to extend that all jquery html manipulation uses so I can see if the class I'm looking for is there on set?
[16:24:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:24:09] <robertmaxrees> tjhere is no.
[16:24:18] <robertmaxrees> there is not a singular point for you to hook into to do what you want.
[16:24:57] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to update all of them.
[16:25:54] <sadtaco> That's not true
[16:26:01] <robertmaxrees> oh okay.
[16:26:04] <robertmaxrees> (wat)
[16:26:05] <sadtaco> .after is an alias for this.parentNode.insertBefore()
[16:26:09] <sadtaco> wat indeed
[16:26:09] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:26:14] <robertmaxrees> what are you talking about?
[16:26:35] <sadtaco> ... what are you talking about?
[16:26:38] <robertmaxrees> you're asking if there's a core function that all the dom manipulation methods run through or something?
[16:26:40] <sadtaco> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=2.1.3&fn=jQuery.fn.before http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=2.1.3&fn=jQuery.fn.after
[16:26:50] <sadtaco> You said I'd have to change EVERY one.
[16:26:54] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:26:58] <sadtaco> There's a few core functions that do the dom manipulation
[16:27:05] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:27:09] <sadtaco> Ok. Done talking to you. Ty.
[16:27:42] <robertmaxrees> try refining your question and being a little less combative.
[16:27:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm willing to be helpful.
[16:27:54] <sadtaco> I was clear. You're the one being combative.
[16:28:10] <robertmaxrees> okay.  back to the first question: " how can I extend the dom manipulation of jQuery?  When I append, insertAfter, prepend, html, etc any html, I want to do something along side it."
[16:28:29] <robertmaxrees> you can manually extend each method to do that.
[16:29:49] <sadtaco> Yes, except I don't have to extend them all. There's only a few.  .html() uses .append. I only see 2 functions and the rest are layers ontop of those. I asked what those core functions are. A helpful answer would be a list of them, or "I don't know", not "all of them" when that's wrong and then arguing with me when I say that's wrong.
[16:30:34] <sadtaco> I'll just go and look through them all.
[16:31:56] <robertmaxrees> i was trying to suggest that really what you want is a templating engine, since extending core jquery methods generally leads to headaches down the road.
[16:33:07] <robertmaxrees> and i think you'll find that messing with $.fn.append() won't actually do everything you think it will in this case.
[16:50:11] <sadtaco> I don't see how adding some code to check if what you're adding has a class that matches a property could create issues. If it does, I'll find them when that happens.  But anyway, I want to avoid templating how Reactjs does it where it all must be there at the very begnning. I need "templating" to work at any point an app is running to set the text of a certain class that's newly added.
[16:50:39] <sadtaco> I'm looking around to see if I can find something else useful...
[16:51:21] <robertmaxrees> there's always bone stock options that requre a little extra work, or you could write your own helpers to do that.  i guess i've been bitten by that sort of stuff too many times in the past.
[16:53:31] <sadtaco> Basically what Reactjs wants to do, I want to do. And I do it, by using jQuery to find classes that match keys and changing them to those values. But it doesn't do it for newly added elements until the value changes.  But I find Reactjs to just be rather ugly, not JS-like, and it requires everything intialized at the start.
[16:54:16] <robertmaxrees> react is very js-like if you think is a more functional style.
[16:54:38] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you really just want .clone() and .text(), either way.
[16:55:15] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, feel free to try extending the base methods yourself.
[16:55:22] <sadtaco> Well the JSX isn't.  The compiled JS is, except it's ugly.
[16:55:41] <robertmaxrees> i think it's all very js-like personally.
[16:55:49] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[16:56:03] <sadtaco> Erm well I'm using .text() to change its text to update the property.  It's just a matter of that only happening when a property is set/changed.
[16:56:05] <robertmaxrees> i don't care about the compiled stuff personally.
[16:56:16] <sadtaco> Here I'll give more detail on the actual app.
[16:56:25] <robertmaxrees> could you make a simplified example?
[16:56:31] <sadtaco> kinda
[16:56:39] <robertmaxrees> that would be fantastic.
[16:57:15] <sadtaco> A simple example will still be like 100-150 lines I think. :|
[16:57:18] <sadtaco> But the concept is simple.
[16:57:24] <robertmaxrees> i can work with that.
[16:57:30] <robertmaxrees> just don't wan an entire site tbh :)
[16:58:36] <sadtaco> Well let me say this and hope it makes sense instead of trying to make a "simplified" example.
[17:00:12] <sadtaco> I'm using Object.observe() to listen for updates to an object.  And I have a wrapper around it.  It's an API I'm using for my own apps. So I can do something like someObject.onChange('add', function(change){ $('#'+ someObject.id +' .'+change.name).find('.value').text(change.prop) });
[17:00:34] <robertmaxrees> heh, that explains a LOT
[17:00:44] <sadtaco> So I can listen for changes to some object from the server, and then it updates its values. But I'm struggling to find a simple way to set them like that to begin with
[17:01:52] <sadtaco> The obvious answer is have the html be like $('<p class="'+foo+'><span class="value">'+someObject.foo+'</span></p>').appendTo(...);
[17:02:03] <sadtaco> But... er it's hard to explain why that is not a good solution.
[17:02:12] <robertmaxrees> or use some basic underscore templating or something similar.
[17:02:24] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, any reason you can't ship them correct data in the first place?
[17:02:47] <robertmaxrees> because normally the way you'd do this is through a more isomorphic setup and/or with some templating.
[17:02:52] <sadtaco> One, the object may not even exist at that point...  Two, it may exist at a very different part of a large code base.  None of that is nearly as clear cut and sensical as the update code is.
[17:03:38] <robertmaxrees> right, which explains a lot.
[17:03:41] <sadtaco> It's also that like... someObject isn't the actual property name. It comes from a hash, or reference.
[17:03:50] <robertmaxrees> an object, right.
[17:04:13] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of an unusual setup.
[17:04:31] <sadtaco> http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2411-using-underscore-js-templates-to-render-html-partials.htm hm like this?
[17:04:45] <robertmaxrees> are you already using react?
[17:04:47] <sadtaco> Yeah well it's... "extremely real time". There isn't much of an application on load.
[17:04:48] <sadtaco> No.
[17:04:49] <robertmaxrees> you kept mentioning it?
[17:04:53] <sadtaco> I rather don't want to. I just looked at it.
[17:04:54] <robertmaxrees> oh...
[17:05:30] <robertmaxrees> heh, i thought you were alreayd using it.  underscore's templating system is pretty basic.  it might offer some advantages.
[17:05:35] <robertmaxrees> might be worth looking at.
[17:05:36] <sadtaco> http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2411-using-underscore-js-templates-to-render-html-partials.htm Like this? Well what happens if I don't have these fancy pointers there on dom load, and instead they are added with jquery afterward?
[17:05:56] <robertmaxrees> check out the underscore docs instead.
[17:06:24] <robertmaxrees> http://underscorejs.org/#template
[17:06:28] <sadtaco> Because the problem is I need something that works when I'm doing $('<h2><%- rc.listTitle %></h2>') and it is seeing that pointer and properly setting it.  I'm not finding something that does that.  I'm finding things that work only when the pointers are there on dom load
[17:06:47] <robertmaxrees> by "pointer" i assume you mean variable?
[17:07:21] <robertmaxrees> and you can compile any template at any time.
[17:07:27] <sadtaco> the <% things.  I didn't want to say variable and confuse it with a JS variable.
[17:07:43] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean the placeholders.
[17:07:50] <sadtaco> Yeah placeholders
[17:07:59] <robertmaxrees> or interpolater values or whatever you want to call them.
[17:08:09] <robertmaxrees> read the underscore docs for templates - http://underscorejs.org/#template
[17:08:30] <sadtaco> underscore template looks like what I need
[17:08:41] <robertmaxrees> iirc react can do the same kind of thing.
[17:08:56] <robertmaxrees> but that's more suited to be your enbtire view layer, not just your templating solution.
[17:09:16] <robertmaxrees> underscore's a decent library and has a lot of other functionality in it that you might find useful.
[17:09:39] <sadtaco> I use underscore quite a bit. Never used that part.
[17:09:44] <robertmaxrees> it's really nice.
[17:11:11] <sadtaco> It'll just say undefined if those properties don't exist, right?
[17:11:21] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember.
[17:12:46] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like it.
[17:13:00] <sadtaco> What does it do? Empty?
[17:13:06] <robertmaxrees> referencerror.
[17:13:09] <sadtaco> I just also wish it were more... "automatic". Which is why I was thinking of extending jQuery things
[17:13:11] <sadtaco> Ah.
[17:13:14] <robertmaxrees> because it returns a function.
[17:13:32] <robertmaxrees> you should really be feeding it good data in the first polace.
[17:13:34] <robertmaxrees> *place
[17:14:21] <sadtaco> It's jsut that sometimes some html could be set for something that's not visible, but by the time it's visible the data would be there.
[17:15:02] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like a race condition you should be avoiding.  why are you rendering something if you don't have data for it?
[17:15:37] <sadtaco> I'm actually not sure if I ever will be, but just as a precaution.
[17:15:57] <robertmaxrees> imo you should guard against that problem.
[17:16:08] <robertmaxrees> since otherwise you're rending before you have data, which doesn't really make sejnse.
[17:17:12] <sadtaco> Hm well it's generally game stuff.  Say, building the way some interface looks at dom load, but you don't have player data from the server until after dom is loaded.  Could wait for player to load and have a loading screen or whatever, but why if it all works out fine?
[17:17:38] <robertmaxrees> note i didn't say *everything*
[17:17:40] <robertmaxrees> just each component
[17:17:48] <robertmaxrees> why render a thing if you don't have what you need for it?
[17:19:56] <sadtaco> I probably won't, like I said. It's still nice to have the option.
[17:20:10] <sadtaco> It's still nice to "just work".
[17:20:25] <robertmaxrees> eh, i guess that's one of those things that's kind of a basic "critical" thing.
[17:20:45] <robertmaxrees> if you don't have data to render something, it doesn't seem like there's anything to render.
[17:21:46] <robertmaxrees> i totally get where you're coming from, just seems kind of strange.
[17:22:43] <sadtaco> I generally agree, and I don't think I'll end up doing that. Just wanted to know that it wouldn't just throw an error and stop.  I don't actually have instances now where I'm trying to create html when the variables don't exist, which is why I had this problem. :P
[17:22:58] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:23:16] <robertmaxrees> imo you should fix that problem, then.
[17:23:51] <sadtaco> No I mean I have the problem of the variables wouldn't be set until they're changed, since only the change thing worked.
[17:24:05] <sadtaco> but uh.
[17:25:06] <sadtaco> I guess if I want to make sure things are set I need to <% if( someObj.prop ){ %><span class="value"><%= someObject.prop %></span><% }) %> A bit ugly.
[17:32:18] <robertmaxrees> i feel like they should be set by default.
[18:24:48] <Zeranoe> is it possible to select an element by its input name="" ?
[18:24:53] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:24:58] <robertmaxrees> using an attribute selector.
[18:25:12] <robertmaxrees> $('input[name="someName"]');
[18:25:28] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Thank you
[18:25:45] <robertmaxrees> thta can be a little slow, so be careful with how much you use i.
[18:25:46] <robertmaxrees> *it
[18:26:57] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Does it support wildcards at all? an example name being name="action-2132" and I'd want to apply it to all action-* ?
[18:27:16] <robertmaxrees> you want an attribute starts with selector.
[18:27:23] <robertmaxrees> but at that point i'd just give the inputs a shared class instead.
[18:27:59] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Much faster selecting classes?
[18:28:03] <robertmaxrees> muuuuch
[18:28:12] <robertmaxrees> and that's part of what classes are for.
[18:28:22] <robertmaxrees> if you really need it: https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[18:29:02] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Nah, I just threw a class in there
[18:29:08] <robertmaxrees> :) awesome.
[18:29:36] <robertmaxrees> there are certainly use cases for for those, but selecting isn't one.
[18:31:01] <Zeranoe> Can jquery force a tab to the next <input> when x amount of characters have been entered? I think I've seen this before in phone number inputs
[18:31:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can do that.
[18:31:55] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery tab to next input

[18:38:09] <sigtau> Hey guys, having a really bad brain-fart here.  Probably burnt out but just curious if I'm doing anything wrong.
[18:38:30] <sigtau> $(".fade-after-delay").load(function(){ $(".fade-after-delay").delay(500).fadeOut(); }); // A div with the .fade-after-delay class applied to it doesn't appear to ever fade out.
[18:38:40] <robertmaxrees> .load()?
[18:38:52] <sigtau> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[18:39:04] <robertmaxrees> right - what element is that?
[18:39:13] <sigtau> Oh jesus.
[18:39:14] <sigtau> document.
[18:39:19] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:40:04] <sigtau> Nevermind.  I'm an idiot.
[18:40:10] <robertmaxrees> 'kay :)
[18:40:16] <robertmaxrees> youy probably meant $(window).load()
[18:40:24] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Hm, not quite getting that to work.. http://jsbin.com/ravuqabohu/1/
[18:40:38] <sigtau> Yeah, you've got me there.
[18:40:39] <sigtau> Thanks for helping me come to.  Rubber duck method, 'n all that.
[18:40:59] <Zeranoe> Looking for it to tab to the next when the first input is filled with 3
[18:41:28] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe did you evemn read the ciode?
[18:41:30] <robertmaxrees> *code
[18:44:19] <Zeranoe> Does that example depend on a user selecting from the autocomplete?
[18:44:31] <robertmaxrees> that example depends on you reading the code :)
[18:44:45] <robertmaxrees> .closest('form').find(':input') is the first part of your problem.
[18:45:16] <robertmaxrees> also, the change event doesn't fire until the element has lost focus.
[18:47:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/demafugexo/1/edit?html,css,js,output Zeranoe
[18:49:00] <robertmaxrees> woops i mean http://jsbin.com/yukuzamobu/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[18:49:02] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go.
[18:50:46] <bambanx> guys why my table is not sortable here : http://codepen.io/bambanx/pen/JddZqb
[20:29:05] <Zeranoe> Should validation be done on the client side or the server side?
[20:29:44] <rcyr> Both
[20:30:48] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Sadly some older browsers do not support HTML5 validation methods. Does jquery help with this/
[20:31:39] <rcyr> Not really... but some plugins do (Client-side validation)
[20:33:04] <Zeranoe> rcyr: It looks like some bigger sites use little to none client validation. How important is it to make sure everything is perfect before sending it to the server
[20:33:15] <rcyr> It's not.
[20:33:26] <rcyr> Client-side validation is a matter of user experience.
[20:33:31] <rcyr> Nothing more.
[20:34:54] <rcyr> Any "input" from a user must be seen as a thread and needs to be properly validated/sanitized on the server-side
[20:35:07] <rcyr> Err
[20:35:13] <rcyr> *threat, not thread
[20:35:41] <Zeranoe> Right
[20:36:14] <rcyr> So, you want client-side validation because you want to give the user "feedback" without having to reload the page if there's an error
[20:37:13] <Zeranoe> But as long as it's "close" allow it to be sent to the server to allow a full sanitation
[20:39:18] <rcyr> Yup :)
[20:40:46] <Zeranoe> How do I bind to the press of a <input type="submit"> ?
[20:42:42] <rcyr> You don't :) It's one of the "gotcha" with forms
[20:42:45] <Zeranoe> .submit() i see
[20:42:55] <Zeranoe> ?
[20:42:57] <rcyr> You bind to the "submit" event of the <form>
[20:43:19] <Zeranoe> As, but not to the input element
[20:43:24] <Zeranoe> Ah*
[20:43:45] <rcyr> Exactly.
