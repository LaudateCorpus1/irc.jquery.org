[00:01:34] <tash> :)
[00:01:51] <tash> inherited code, needs a complete revamp, and I'm not an expert so learning as I go
[00:02:20] <Uhkis> so you wanted border on the bottom of the notes tab?
[00:02:46] <tash> yeah, but so that it doesn't seem double bordered/too bold on page load...
[00:02:58] <tash> you noticed that when you click Notes, it looks dumb with no border on the bottom
[00:06:34] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/s1ornz8a/3/ something like this?
[00:09:57] <tash> Yeah, now I just need to understand what you did. Thanks. I'm looking things over
[00:15:40] <surianup> Hi all
[00:15:58] <surianup> I need to access the data
[00:15:59] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/2ou2oxvr/1/
[00:16:10] <surianup> and images needs to access dynamically
[00:16:14] <surianup> can you please help me
[00:17:17] <tash> Uhkis: I didn't want to straight up steal your stuff, so I'm trying to implement those changes in my previous fiddle.  Why isn't it working? I'm not seeing what I'm missing: https://jsfiddle.net/s1ornz8a/7/
[00:18:30] <Uhkis> tash: check the css part of mine, i made the #content-title-container a lot simpler
[00:18:35] <Cork> surianup: http://jsfiddle.net/2ou2oxvr/3/
[00:18:42] <Uhkis> tash: currently your border-style breaks it
[00:19:03] <Uhkis> tash: line 6 of the css
[00:21:14] <surianup> Thansk Cork
[00:21:21] <surianup> thankyou ver much
[00:22:09] <tash> Uhkis: so I lose the pretty rounded corners? :)
[00:23:52] <Uhkis> tash: #6 has nothing to do with rounded corners
[00:25:10] <tash> line 6 being content-body-container, right?
[00:25:22] <tash> you said content-title-container, so I was getting confused at what I was looking at
[00:26:01] <Uhkis> tash: line 6 of the css (there's line numbers in the fiddle)
[00:26:28] <tash> ah, I got it
[00:26:37] <tash> sorry about that...I need to go to bed!
[00:27:07] <tash> thx once again for your help
[00:27:13] <tash> I need some zzz's, later
[00:27:19] <Uhkis> sleep tight!
[00:46:08] <r000ty_> what's the effect on the image here called guys? http://jacksonmee.com/
[00:47:56] <Cork> r000ty_: shutter
[00:48:16] <r000ty_> Cork, are you from Cork? if so I owe you a guiness big chap!
[00:48:33] <Cork> if you mean the initial effect, then yes
[00:49:01] <happyKatt> 0.0
[00:49:29] <Uhkis> i think he meant that matrix3d thingy that follows your mouse
[00:49:58] <happyKatt> page took forever to download
[00:50:10] <r000ty_> Uhkis, yes the 3d matrix thing that follows your muose
[00:50:14] <Cork> in that cause, no clue
[00:50:18] <r000ty_> So Cork, nope not Shutter.
[00:51:05] <happyKatt> i used to have my mouse icon as a peeling banana.  those were the good old days!
[00:52:00] <happyKatt> then one of the v.p.'s of the company had to use my computer while i was out for the day...very embarrasing
[00:54:46] <r000ty_> you can just imagine his/her face as they moves it around the desktop
[00:54:53] <r000ty_> "what have we employed here..."
[01:37:04] <JosefDe> Hey guys. How can I prevent a special div from being converted into an accordion
[01:37:05] <JosefDe> ?
[01:43:31] <JosefDe> anyone an idea?
[02:00:48] <JosefDe> Has anyone an idea?
[02:28:04] <JosefDe> hello? anyone online?
[02:45:12] <Uhkis> ?anyone
[02:45:12] <b-ot> Uhkis: Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[04:26:01] <FilipNortic> not sure I know how to turn a div in to an accordion, hard to go about reversing it
[04:28:21] <taplar> FilipNortic: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse-example-accordion
[04:30:52] <dimi1947> I have added some images in the DOM dynamically...the click handlers though do not work on them though...what to do?
[04:31:09] <taplar> got a fiddle?
[04:31:39] <taplar> make sure your binding to them after they have been added to the dom, or your using a delegated binding
[04:33:56] <dimi1947> I will prepare a fiddle....give a minute or so
[05:09:16] <DarsVaeda> I have an array of jquery dom elements, I want to turn them into a jquery "array" to do something like $(array).hide() or so...do I ust "$().add(object).add(object)..." for that?
[05:10:29] <taplar> uh, you could do $.each(basicArray, function(obj){ obj.hide(); });
[05:11:20] <Cork> DarsVaeda: $(array).hide() should work just fine
[05:11:58] <Cork> (though why have an array of arrays)
[05:12:42] <DarsVaeda> hmm thanks I'll try that
[05:13:39] <Cork> hmm no it doesn't
[05:13:42] <DarsVaeda> I have them grouped by some hash for faster selecting
[05:14:10] <taplar> classes can facilitate that
[05:15:21] <taplar> outside of css, kinda the point of classes, grouping
[05:16:02] <Cork> i guess $($.map(arr, function(jq) { return jq.get() })).hide() could be an option :)
[05:17:07] <DarsVaeda> I'll give you an example of what I try...maybe it's stupid anyway ^^
[05:18:51] <printForever> I'm looking for a plugin that does this http://i.imgur.com/WHwyNoU.jpg
[05:19:53] <DarsVaeda> I was as far as this: http://jsfiddle.net/0aurn6ry/ - I want to click a filter and hide all element that do not have the hash
[05:20:53] <taplar> yeah, why not use classes?
[05:21:45] <xec> is "filer" supposed to be "filter"?
[05:22:09] <DarsVaeda> ah yeah right, typo sorry
[05:22:22] <DarsVaeda> taplar, you mean to hide the "hiding" functionality?
[05:22:31] <taplar> yeah
[05:23:04] <DarsVaeda> I thought I might overdo it
[05:23:25] <taplar> so instead you created an entirely seperate construct, seeded it, and used that
[05:23:29] <taplar> heh
[05:23:57] <DarsVaeda> okay yeeeahhh if you put it like that :D
[05:27:39] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/0aurn6ry/1/
[05:28:12] <taplar> might have the show/hide backwards
[05:28:14] <printForever> Cork, taplar
[05:28:23] <printForever> can you recommend something for this? http://i.imgur.com/WHwyNoU.jpg
[05:28:54] <taplar> printForever: I dunno a plugin that does that off the top of my head
[05:29:13] <printForever> taplar, what should I search for?
[05:30:01] <taplar> maybe something like 'floating child within parent' or something?  not sure
[05:30:10] <printForever> ok
[05:30:23] <PCatinean> Hey guys, if I have something like 32400 how do I always put a . for the last 3 numbers/
[05:30:27] <PCatinean> so I end up with 32.400?
[05:31:21] <taplar> is it 32400 or '32400'?
[05:31:49] <PCatinean> ahhh wait nvm, I can do that in python and just send the final string like this :D
[05:31:53] <PCatinean> thanks!
[05:32:35] <printForever> https://github.com/yairEO/stickyfloat
[05:33:27] <taplar> kinda looks like it
[05:36:57] <printForever> I used this one http://leafo.net/sticky-kit/
[05:37:19] <taplar> cool
[05:46:30] <taplar> so i was just told that apparently today is 'national punctuation day'.  or as i like to call it, 'shatner day'
[05:47:15] <Cork> punctuation day??
[05:47:19] <Cork> heh...
[05:47:27] <taplar> yes, Cork, punctuation.... day
[05:47:54] <taplar> we're americans.  we're stupid like that
[05:48:00] <Cork> ppl are defining days for anything now days
[05:49:24] <PCatinean> hahah :))
[05:50:14] <tommy_s> hey, I have an element I created in Jquery which I want to be deleted in a diffrence scenerio on the program. thing is, I can't choose the element using the $('') way, so.. is there another way to do it?
[05:50:35] <taplar> if you can't select it it isn't in the dom
[05:50:39] <taplar> or your selector is bad
[05:50:41] <Cork> tommy_s: you could keep a reference to it
[05:51:16] <tommy_s> var x = $('name').appendTo("body") you mean?
[05:51:29] <taplar> uh, that's not valid
[05:51:46] <tommy_s> var x = $('<div />').appendTo("body") you mean?
[05:51:47] <tommy_s> :|
[05:52:00] <taplar> sure
[05:52:08] <tommy_s> thanks, ill try it!
[05:52:14] <taplar> though appendTo($('body')) maybe
[05:53:01] <taplar> but if you make it a var you'll have to be careful about the scope for later use
[05:53:21] <taplar> i'd just stick an id or class on it to select by later and call it done
[05:54:05] <tommy_s> its actually works like magic, thanks!\
[05:54:17] <tommy_s> didnt knew that appendTo had a return value
[05:54:26] <taplar> whatever is operated upon
[05:54:40] <Cork> appendTo takes a selector
[05:54:44] <Cork> so you don't need $() there
[05:54:46] <taplar> ah, cool
[05:55:27] <Cork> tommy_s: also appendTo returns the original jquery object, like most jquery functions
[05:55:54] <Cork> $().css().text().append().html().appendTo().toggleClass()
[05:56:05] <tommy_s> thanks
[05:59:58] <zumba_addict> good morning, how can this be better written? Just saw it today in one of our files. All I know is to always make sure we don't use eval because it's evil. http://pastebin.com/s0qZQ57F
[06:00:40] <taplar> i'm assuming data is json logic?
[06:00:44] <taplar> err, java
[06:00:46] <taplar> script
[06:00:47] <taplar> man
[06:01:27] <Cork> zumba_addict: if what you get is javascript there isn't much you can do about it
[06:01:41] <Cork> eval is how you handle javascript sent over ajax
[06:01:42] <zumba_addict> k
[06:01:53] <Cork> $.getScript => $.globalEval
[06:02:03] <Cork> $.globalEval => window.eval
[06:02:06] <zumba_addict> i was hoping if I can share a better code to our app
[06:02:08] <zumba_addict> :)
[06:02:14] <zumba_addict> got it
[06:02:26] <taplar> well, you could include it on the page already instead of fetching it
[06:02:31] <Cork> zumba_addict: i've moved to setting csp on the site, and statically loading all the js ahead of time
[06:02:35] <taplar> and just execute it when you need to
[06:02:50] <Cork> zumba_addict: it forced me to look into none js sending solutions and actually cleaned up the code a lot
[06:02:59] <zumba_addict> that's a nice idea Cork. I think csp is related to security something?
[06:03:06] <Cork> yes
[06:03:15] <Cork> it forbids eval, inline scripts and so on
[06:03:17] <zumba_addict> would love to see a snippet if it's ok?
[06:03:21] <Cork> (you can pick what to forbid)
[06:03:39] <Cork> zumba_addict: i define all functions in an object structure
[06:03:51] <zumba_addict> k
[06:03:54] <zumba_addict> that's a great idea too taplar
[06:04:04] <taplar> it's pretty much what Cork is talking about
[06:04:05] <Cork> then i send group, function name, and a json argument
[06:04:26] <zumba_addict> do you have a small jsfiddle of it?
[06:04:30] <Cork> zumba_addict: app[group][funcname](arguments);
[06:04:37] <taplar> i can show you how i structure my namespaces
[06:04:44] <zumba_addict> k
[06:04:47] <Cork> or rather app[group][funcname](data)
[06:04:50] <taplar> might be a little overboard, but i like it for my purposes and testing
[06:05:12] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/site-editor/blob/master/public/scripts/src/loggingService.js
[06:05:20] <zumba_addict> looking
[06:05:30] <Cork> zumba_addict: and the namespace is just (function() { window.app = { something: function() {}, .... } })
[06:05:40] <Cork> opps missed the ending ()
[06:05:44] <Cork> (function() { window.app = { something: function() {}, .... } })()
[06:05:45] <zumba_addict> for iife?
[06:06:06] <zumba_addict> i'm also interested in the csp part
[06:06:17] <Cork> ?mdn csp header
[06:06:18] <b-ot> Cork: Using Content Security Policy - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Using_Content_Security_Policy
[06:06:25] <Cork> it is quite simple
[06:06:42] <Cork> handing the consequences requires getting used to though :)
[06:06:54] <Cork> but when you do you don't want to go back
[06:07:12] <zumba_addict> k
[06:08:14] <zumba_addict> i'm looking at your code taplar, i'm thinking how I can load the script
[06:08:19] <Cork> what we use is quite simple in nginx
[06:08:33] <Cork> add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'";
[06:08:46] <taplar> mine are structured so that when you want to use them, you do WhateverService.getInstance().publicfunction()
[06:08:58] <Cork> (cause forbidding inline styles is a bit too much for me as of yet :) )
[06:09:23] <taplar> functions in 'api' are public, those in 'functions' are private, so it's a conscious decision which ones to expose
[06:09:43] <Cork> taplar: you can do that without using functions though
[06:09:56] <taplar> yeah, i just like this structure, :)
[06:10:04] <zumba_addict> ah so those server config changes are required?
[06:10:08] <Cork> everyone for there taste :)
[06:10:22] <Cork> zumba_addict: the server is what activates csp
[06:10:39] <Cork> it then dictates what the browser should allow happen
[06:10:43] <zumba_addict> ok, if I go with that route, i'll have to submit a change request
[06:10:59] <Cork> zumba_addict: make sure the page works with it first :)
[06:11:05] <zumba_addict> yup
[06:11:10] <zumba_addict> it's a one time change right
[06:11:41] <Cork> well ya, but it means all event attributes has to go
[06:11:53] <Cork> and all <script>someting</script>
[06:11:57] <Cork> and all eval()
[06:12:02] <Cork> and new Function()
[06:12:13] <zumba_addict> ah
[06:12:16] <Cork> so it is quite a big change :)
[06:12:20] <zumba_addict> so new Function() is also bad?
[06:12:27] <Cork> ne Function is the same as eval
[06:12:33] <zumba_addict> wow
[06:12:40] <Cork> only difference is it returns a function you can execute
[06:12:44] <zumba_addict> that's why i read to use object literals is better?
[06:12:46] <zumba_addict> am I right?
[06:12:50] <Cork> yes
[06:12:55] <Cork> cause it doesn't execute anything
[06:13:01] <zumba_addict> we have tons of new Fn
[06:13:32] <zumba_addict> maybe better to use it on a new project
[06:13:33] <Cork> the problem with eval and function is that if anyone can manage to get random text in there they can xss you
[06:13:43] <zumba_addict> gotcha
[06:13:50] <Cork> while if someone gets random text into obj[keyname]()
[06:13:59] <Cork> it just means they execute your predefined function
[06:14:08] <Cork> and that should be safe, unless you write it really badly
[06:14:11] <zumba_addict> i like the part now that you're talking about because I like security so much :)
[06:14:40] <zumba_addict> last night I attended Trojaned Gems
[06:14:57] <zumba_addict> it's a Chicago Security Meetup
[06:15:15] <zumba_addict> it was ok
[06:15:22] <Cork> btw unless you knew event attributes mean ex <div onclick="something()">
[06:15:31] <Cork> or onmouseover=""
[06:15:34] <Cork> and so on
[06:15:34] <zumba_addict> wow, that has to go away too?
[06:15:41] <Cork> yes cause that is eval too
[06:15:56] <zumba_addict> so how do we make a button call the fn we need to call?
[06:16:01] <zumba_addict> listenTo?
[06:16:02] <zumba_addict> .on
[06:16:13] <Cork> $('selector').on('click', func);
[06:16:15] <Cork> yes
[06:16:18] <zumba_addict> got it
[06:16:21] <Cork> keep js out of the html
[06:16:42] <Cork> the html should only have <script src=""></script> elements
[06:16:43] <zumba_addict> i remember an xss attack which uses onclick onmouseover, et
[06:16:46] <Cork> no other js in there
[06:16:54] <zumba_addict> got it
[06:16:55] <Cork> ya, they are common
[06:16:56] <zumba_addict> nice
[06:17:11] <Cork> and onload and onerror (the most common)
[06:17:14] <zumba_addict> so csp really puts the app in better secured shape
[06:17:19] <Cork> yes
[06:17:34] <Cork> and when we're at it throw "use strict"; when your at it :)
[06:17:39] <zumba_addict> now once we implemenent it, we will get used to programming securely
[06:17:48] <Cork> *; in there when you're at it :)
[06:17:52] <zumba_addict> yup
[06:18:20] <Cork> one downside is that data-uri css images won't work
[06:18:28] <Cork> but that is ok i think
[06:18:38] <zumba_addict> i think it's fine
[06:19:01] <Cork> you can enable data uris
[06:19:12] <zumba_addict> gotcha, that's nice
[06:19:16] <Cork> but that enables some attack vektors
[06:19:24] <Cork> csp is quite configurable
[06:20:02] <zumba_addict> got it, i'll read more on that link
[06:20:20] <Cork> ya, that link is good, it should tell you everything you need
[06:20:40] <Cork> except possibly what attack vectors the different prefs open
[06:20:45] <zumba_addict> cool
[06:21:17] <Cork> something i would have liked to have for some of the more obscure things
[06:21:29] <zumba_addict> i'm just amazed how hackers read this documentation over and over and over
[06:21:41] <zumba_addict> we should do more than what they do
[06:21:50] <zumba_addict> got it
[06:22:00] <Cork> ya
[06:22:17] <Cork> well hackers read each security patch to find what exploit it fixed
[06:22:31] <zumba_addict> yup
[06:22:33] <Cork> i don't expect site developers to do the same >_>
[06:22:37] <zumba_addict> that's what I got to start doing
[06:23:06] <Cork> each security patch for each browser release?
[06:23:12] <zumba_addict> because I like to become very good at web application penetration, ethically though
[06:23:13] <Cork> you don't have time to do much else XD
[06:23:20] <zumba_addict> :D
[06:23:50] <zumba_addict> i almost got in trouble at work, my first week
[06:23:54] <Cork> zumba_addict: also note that csp doesn't mean you can lax on escaping/filtering js server side
[06:24:01] <zumba_addict> i felt i was going to get let go quickly
[06:24:06] <Cork> it is meant to be an extra layer of protection if something slipped though
[06:24:08] <zumba_addict> ah
[06:24:34] <Cork> and there are loads of browsers out there that doesn't support csp
[06:24:59] <zumba_addict> ah
[06:25:15] <zumba_addict> mobiles too can be affecteed
[06:25:22] <Cork> sure
[06:25:55] <Cork> and tvs and refrigerators and door displays and... :)
[06:26:19] <Cork> every freaking thing have a browser now days >_>
[06:29:38] <zumba_addict> :D IoT
[06:30:15] <zumba_addict> i was part of building IoT and found and exploited vulnerabilities at work
[06:30:50] <Cork> ya, those things are horrible when it comes to security
[06:30:51] <zumba_addict> the boss didn't agree with all the not so good approach that was implemented in backend
[06:31:39] <zumba_addict> the boss didn't agree with me that the way he implemented backend was bad
[06:34:51] <taplar> people are touchy about their code
[06:35:29] <Cork> well some are
[06:36:05] <taplar> i'm not saying its a bad thing.
[06:36:18] <taplar> the bad thing is when valid reasons for improvement are given and ignored
[06:36:35] <Cork> i don't agree
[06:37:24] <Cork> code is code, there shouldn't be any feelings about how it works (one can argue about how readable it is but not the function)
[06:38:01] <Cork> the thing i have the biggest problem with is the language wars
[06:38:16] <taplar> ?
[06:38:18] <Cork> "you should use x cause it is better then y" sigh
[06:38:46] <Cork> to the point of ppl writing enterpreter in language x to run language y in it >_<
[06:38:57] <taplar> ah
[06:39:55] <Cork> i even saw a page using a php vm written in js to run php on the page :/
[06:40:02] <Cork> made me want to puke
[06:40:16] <taplar> wtf
[06:40:28] <jcrawford> hello everyone, so in my code i have something like the following var tableRow = $('.delete').closest('tr').find('td').fadeOut(), I am getting an error that find is not a function.  I have done a console.log($('.delete').closest('tr')); and it is showing the tr element with children td's, any reason why this would not like the find function>?
[06:41:30] <Cork> jcrawford: are you sure $ is jquery in that part of the page?
[06:41:37] <Cork> cause ya that make no sense
[06:41:49] <Cork> closest ALWAYS return a jquery object
[06:41:50] <jcrawford> hmm let me check
[06:41:54] <Cork> so .find should always exist
[06:43:03] <jcrawford> when I alert($); i get the following: function (a,b){return new m.fn.init(a,b)}
[06:43:17] <jcrawford> this is being used in a success closure for $.post
[06:44:03] <puneet28> hELLO
[06:45:14] <taplar> jcrawford: if u change $('.delete') to jQuery('.delete') what happens?
[06:45:45] <jcrawford> sorry let me pastebin my code as i am not using $('.delete') rather $(this) as the element was clicked
[06:46:07] <Cork> jcrawford: don't use alert, test with console.log($.fn.jquery)
[06:46:11] <jcrawford> here is my "probably crappy" code :)
[06:46:12] <jcrawford> http://jsfiddle.net/1xow8vqc/
[06:46:26] <Cork> it should give you the jquery version as a string
[06:46:37] <Cork> if it gives you undefined then $ isn't jquery
[06:46:55] <jcrawford> i event tried setting var element = $(this); up by user_name and then referencing element in the success function
[06:47:18] <puneet28> Is it possible to drag and drop rows from excel file on to a html page so that the data dropped can be saved
[06:47:28] <Cork> AH
[06:47:45] <jcrawford> oh i got it
[06:47:52] <Cork> jcrawford: that is inside the callback from the $.post
[06:47:59] <Cork> this isn't the clicked element there
[06:48:13] <jcrawford> yep my issue was i was doing var element = this; and not $(this);
[06:48:22] <jcrawford> and referencing with element. not $(element).
[06:48:29] <jcrawford> all set thanks for pointing out my issues here :D
[06:48:33] <Cork> well ya and you do var tableRow = $(this).closest('tr');
[06:48:50] <taplar> what is ln 22-24?
[06:49:07] <taplar> oh, nvm, spacing threw me off
[06:49:12] <robhol> undefined (¬u¬)
[06:49:20] <taplar> that's an unnecessary anonymous function
[06:49:31] <taplar> you can just give it tableRow.remove
[06:49:32] <Cork> taplar: no it isn't
[06:50:01] <Cork> if you give it tableRow.remove it will lose the assosiation with tableRow
[06:50:15] <taplar> how so?
[06:50:38] <jcrawford> not only that i want to remove it after fading out for the animation :)
[06:51:03] <jcrawford> ah i see you mean remove() vs remove
[06:51:17] <Cork> taplar: var a = { me: "yes", example: function() { return this.me; } }; var b = a.example; b(); == exception
[06:51:22] <Cork> cause window.me isn't defined
[06:51:53] <Cork> tableRow.remove.bind(tableRow) is an alternative
[06:51:59] <Cork> but i'm not a big fan of bind
[06:53:12] <Cork> taplar: the reason for the problem is cause the "object." is what defines what "this" is
[06:53:27] <Cork> if you lose that this gets the default value == window
[06:54:10] <taplar> wow, gah. lol
[06:54:36] <Cork> taplar: and another interesting example
[06:54:38] <taplar> so it only works if you don't use 'this'
[06:55:11] <Cork> js> var a = { me: "yes", example: function() { return this.me; } }, b = { me: "bu" }; b.test = a.example; print(b.test())
[06:55:28] <b-ot> Cork: bu
[06:55:35] <penw> Hola beautiful people
[06:55:37] <taplar> yeah, that makes sense
[06:55:38] <penw> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/388a2cd92e932fac5ed3
[06:55:51] <penw> why does the keypress never occur on load? :)
[06:55:54] <Cork> taplar: well ya, but that means you won't use prototype
[06:56:03] <Cork> taplar: and that basically means no jquery :)
[06:56:17] <taplar> i've did that before when doing domain functions and i'd tie the getters setters like that
[06:56:27] <penw> (however it works when I run it from console..)
[06:56:31] <Cork> penw: that is keyup not keypress
[06:56:46] <penw> keyup it is!
[06:57:00] <penw> but it's not firing on load
[06:57:03] <Cork> penw: also what are you trying to do?
[06:57:19] <penw> I am trying to simulate a key press in a textbox on load
[06:57:33] <Cork> what even have you bound on the input field?
[06:57:36] <Cork> *event
[06:58:01] <penw> I am looking for keyups on the input field
[06:58:14] <penw> it works as expected when I run it from the console in chrome
[06:58:15] <Cork> so .on('keyup', func)?
[06:58:24] <penw> $('#filter').keyup(function() { });
[06:58:27] <Cork> ok
[06:58:38] <Cork> $('#filter').trigger('keyup') should work
[06:59:09] <Cork> not sure if which actually works on $.Event
[06:59:15] <puneet28> Cork: is it possible to drag and drop rows from excel file on to a html page so that the data dropped can be saved
[06:59:19] <penw> Does not work
[06:59:30] <Cork> penw: also i would recommend using a <form> around the input field, and bind the submit event on that instead
[06:59:41] <penw> The keyup works as expected when ran from the console in chrome
[06:59:42] <Cork> it doesn't work around the browser
[06:59:47] <Cork> it usually makes things more stable
[06:59:52] <penw> it just doesn't work when I load the page
[07:00:06] <penw> tested with trigger('keyup'), same result
[07:00:33] <penw> Hm, alright
[07:02:48] <Cork> penw: my recommendation: http://jsfiddle.net/8s5nzzcs/
[07:03:54] <Cork> (might want to add a search button for good measure :D )
[07:04:07] <Cork> but that's optional except for older ie
[07:04:25] <penw> thanks, I'll have a look
[07:13:08] <penw> the issue Cork is that I filter every time the user types something in the filter field
[07:13:36] <Cork> penw: that should happen on an on('input', func) on the input field
[07:13:44] <Cork> the 13 check shouldn't though
[07:13:47] <penw> it works as expected when the browser has loaded the web page fully
[07:14:13] <dimi1947> I have observed that when elements are added to the DOM dynamically..the click handlers do not work on them...what can I do in such a a case
[07:14:16] <penw> but since I also check for input in the hash I need to trigger the keyup on load
[07:14:21] <penw> which does not work before the page has loaded fully
[07:14:46] <Cork> penw: an option (if that is what you want would be .on('input', function() { $(this).closest('form').trigger('submit'); });
[07:15:02] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/jj20gvrt/
[07:15:12] <Cork> penw: keyup is a poor event to use for input
[07:15:24] <Cork> it doesn't trigger for a lot of inputs
[07:15:49] <penw> alright
[07:15:52] <Cork> (like paste, cut or so on)
[07:15:56] <Cork> d&d
[07:16:20] <Cork> and you need to check for none printable inputs
[07:16:34] <penw> I don't really mind about cut paste etc
[07:16:45] <Cork> or and it doesn't catch repeated inputs (holding a key down)
[07:17:01] <penw> it's just filtering a table
[07:17:30] <Cork> copy pasting should be something you want to support
[07:17:34] <Cork> but ya, that's just me
[07:18:53] <penw> the only issue I have right now is that the bound keyup does not register keyups before the browser has fully loaded the page
[07:19:27] <Cork> penw: are you sure that is the problem and not that the event expects other things?
[07:19:45] <Cork> or ex. that the event handler isn't bound yet
[07:19:50] <penw> yes, I executed it from the chrome developer console
[07:19:59] <penw> and it filtered after that
[07:20:05] <Cork> you most likely run the console after the page load
[07:20:18] <penw> yes
[07:20:21] <Cork> so that isn't really a safe benchmark
[07:21:03] <penw> so how could I actually trigger the keypress after page load?
[07:25:20] <penw> ok
[07:25:22] <penw> figured it out
[07:26:11] <penw> turns out adding elements asynchronously messes it up :-)

[08:26:33] <Hornet-Wing> Hi all, I am looking to sync the scrolling position between 2 users. The way I was planning on accomplishing this was to have a bound scroll event send across the scrollTop position to the other user. My issue is when the 2nd user gets scrolled to that position the event is triggered again. I have looked into unbinding while a function moves the scroll and rebinding after but that doesnt seem to stop the event execution.
[08:26:45] <Hornet-Wing> Here is a simplified JSFiddle of the issue http://jsfiddle.net/j3ccwLoh/1/ . Any ideas?
[08:39:32] <krambiorix> hi, i have divs with different widths and heights. Is there any plugin that puts the boxes nicely on the page?
[08:39:57] <krambiorix> something like : http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KBi5zDIOMOQ/VSeyr16AH3I/AAAAAAAAAtE/cKfr4lPLbLM/s1600/collabco-jisc-rsc-presentation-2013-4-638.jpg
[08:40:14] <duch_kazatel> masonry maybe?
[08:51:58] <anli> Is there an event occuring in a textbox if it was automatically filled in by chrome because of its autofilling of forms?
[08:53:03] <duch_kazatel> chrome triggers a change iirc.
[08:53:08] <mooncup> anli: interesting question
[08:54:00] <mooncup> my googling only leads me to old articles
[08:54:16] <mooncup> you should probably test each browser if you want to be sure unless someone here happens to know
[09:02:03] <krambiorix> anyone?
[09:02:22] <duch_kazatel> already responded hth
[09:04:37] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, ow i thought that was for someone else
[09:04:56] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, what you want to build is pretty basic.
[09:05:03] <krambiorix> ow?
[09:05:19] <duch_kazatel> bunch of boxes that are the same width/height all basically floating left.
[09:06:22] <shoky> Hornet-Wing: you can use a boolean flag to disable the scroll handler (e.g. var disable = false;), set it to true before setting the scrollTop, and then set it back to false in a setTimeout(function() { ... }, 0)
[09:13:47] <shoky> Hornet-Wing: hmm nevermind i guess. could've sworn that worked ok for me,  doesn't seem to be working great now
[09:16:57] <Hornet-Wing> Yeah, i tried that version too.
[09:17:29] <zumba_addict> is it possible to make a Deferred function?
[09:17:42] <zumba_addict> I remember doing it before in AngularJS
[09:17:44] <Hornet-Wing> shoky: the browser seems to check and complete the events AFTER I rebind it rather than when it scroll happens
[09:17:46] <duch_kazatel> wat
[09:17:56] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict you can have a function that returns a deferred object.
[09:18:12] <zumba_addict> yup, i want to do that. Do you have any example?
[09:18:18] <shoky> Hornet-Wing: yeah it's pretty annoying
[09:18:35] <duch_kazatel> var myFunction() { return $.Deferred(); };
[09:18:44] <shoky> maybe duch will have an idea
[09:18:50] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?

[09:19:27] <shoky> and this is what i've been testing with now - http://jsfiddle.net/j3ccwLoh/2/
[09:19:44] <zumba_addict> ok, checking duch_kazatel
[09:19:50] <shoky> even setTimeout of 100 doesn't do it
[09:20:19] <duch_kazatel> check to see what triggered the scroll event and have your listener conditionally fire the logic.
[09:20:56] <shoky> well i'm doing a check via that boolean flag, doesn't seem to do it
[09:21:03] <shoky> or you mean a better way to check?
[09:21:03] <duch_kazatel> or add some payload data to the thing that triggers the scroll and go from there.
[09:21:05] <zumba_addict> i'm still confused duch_kazatel on how to use it
[09:21:16] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict i think you're confused about waht you want.  could you clarify?
[09:21:26] <zumba_addict> one sec
[09:21:45] <zumba_addict> I posted this earlier http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32765530/js-code-is-intermittent-in-safari
[09:21:51] <duch_kazatel> shoky you can test e.originalEvent - if that's undefined, you can pretty safely assumed the event was synthetically triggered.
[09:21:52] <shoky> welp the thing that triggers the scroll is just setting the .scrollTop
[09:22:00] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[09:22:05] <duch_kazatel> hrm...
[09:22:05] <zumba_addict> i'd like to make var views = this.getViews use $.Deferred
[09:22:22] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict so you want this.getViews to be a Deferred object?
[09:22:26] <zumba_addict> so that this.mobileView = views.contentView; will really get the value
[09:22:29] <zumba_addict> yeah
[09:22:55] <zumba_addict> right now, I'm doing   if (views) { .... } and it's working
[09:23:04] <zumba_addict> if I remove it, there are times it will fail in Safari
[09:23:36] <zumba_addict> and looking at our code, it sure will fail sometimes
[09:24:09] <duch_kazatel> testing an idea.
[09:24:10] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[09:24:16] <zumba_addict> cool :)
[09:24:49] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8snh3gjj/ zumba_addict
[09:24:54] <zumba_addict> looking
[09:25:15] <duch_kazatel> the window.setTimeout(function() { section could be your ajax code or any other async operation.
[09:25:26] <Hornet-Wing> shoky: found a fix
[09:25:58] <zumba_addict> yup
[09:26:18] <Hornet-Wing> my previous code but using $(scrollContainer).scrollTop(pixels) instead of scrollTop = ...
[09:26:52] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict the other way is do do http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ukwka6yw/
[09:26:55] <zumba_addict> sweet! Thanks a lot!
[09:26:59] <zumba_addict> looking
[09:27:00] <duch_kazatel> *to do
[09:27:07] <duch_kazatel> i'd go with the first personally.
[09:27:32] <zumba_addict> cool
[09:27:37] <Hornet-Wing> still not really sure why that works apart from its jQuery as opposed the just JS
[09:27:39] <isthisreallife> how to change '.beauty .article-info-block:after' background-color property using js??
[09:27:43] <zumba_addict> it's more readable
[09:27:54] <shoky> Hornet-Wing   if scrollContainer is a DOMElement, then  scrollContainer.scrollTop=pixels   should do the same as $(scrollContainer).scrollTop(pixels)
[09:27:57] <duch_kazatel> isthisreallife you can't.
[09:28:05] <duch_kazatel> isthisreallife :after isn't apart of the DOM.
[09:28:17] <shoky> Hornet-Wing: so what's the fix?
[09:28:19] <zumba_addict> now i need to search the whole app who are using this getViews method
[09:28:25] <zumba_addict> so i won't break anything :)
[09:29:18] <Hornet-Wing> http://jsfiddle.net/j3ccwLoh/3/
[09:30:03] <Hornet-Wing> using jQuery scrollTop doesnt show the "sent message" message
[09:30:07] <shoky> Hornet-Wing: heh that's not a fix, that doesn't really set the scrollTop property
[09:30:31] <shoky> Hornet-Wing: you're just setting a .scrollTop property on a jquery object, not on the DOM element.
[09:30:31] <Hornet-Wing> doesnt it?
[09:30:31] <zumba_addict> is promise the same as deferred?
[09:30:39] <shoky> Hornet-Wing: so that's not causing the element to scroll
[09:37:06] <shoky> zumba_addict: a promise is the same as a deferred, except you can't resolve or reject it yourself (can't call .resolve or .reject on a promise).  so usually some library/function would create a deferred and have code that eventually resolves/rejects it. and this lib/function will only return the .promise() of the deferred so that the lib user can only query it for its eventual result/error
[09:37:21] <zumba_addict> ah
[09:37:43] <shoky> zumba_addict: it's basically a subset of the deferred methods
[09:37:53] <zumba_addict> got it. Thanks a lot
[09:37:54] <shoky> a more limited view/interface
[09:39:21] <shoky> for example,  if $.ajax returned a deferred instead of a promise, then you could call .resolve or .reject yourself on the returned deferred.. and.. that doesn't even make sense ;p
[09:39:44] <shoky> (technically $.ajax returns a jqXHR, which is also a promise)
[09:40:44] <duch_kazatel> couldn't you technically describe "promise" as more of an "interface"?
[09:41:03] <duch_kazatel> i always get the mental model for that distinction twisted up.
[09:41:33] <shoky> more of an interface, as opposed to the implementation?  sure that works
[09:41:52] <shoky> a deferred is the guts of a promise ;p
[09:42:00] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's what i'm getting at.
[09:42:05] <duch_kazatel> shoky++
[09:43:31] <zumba_addict> duch_kazatel: the deferred worked but the render on the view got affected. It happened first before the resolve :(
[09:43:38] <zumba_addict> hunting it down
[09:44:05] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict everything needs to be on the .done() callback.
[09:44:16] <zumba_addict> yup
[09:55:22] <Hornet-Wing> shoky: You're right, I made a typo and didnt rebind the event. Any ideas how I can complete the task?
[09:55:24] <zumba_addict> so the deferred that I just added, I found out that it was also wrapped with the promise returned by BackboneJS
[09:55:43] <duch_kazatel> so then just pass through the promise instead.
[09:57:28] <zumba_addict> what i've done inside the .done, I have this.mobileView = data.someprop.  How will I change it to pass promise instead?
[09:57:55] <duch_kazatel> i need to see your original code.
[09:57:58] <zumba_addict> k
[09:59:23] <shoky> Hornet-Wing:  doesn't seem there's a great solution for this  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7035896/detect-whether-scroll-event-was-created-by-user
[09:59:50] <shoky> maybe something there might work for you ;\
[10:03:21] <Hornet-Wing> ok, thanks. Seems similar to what you tried in your JSFiddle
[10:04:32] <zumba_addict> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/avG5Xrrb
[10:04:53] <zumba_addict> the "this.getViews" is a new one where you helped me earlier
[10:05:03] <duch_kazatel> wut
[10:05:05] <duch_kazatel> i'm way lost.
[10:05:31] <zumba_addict> I mean, this.getViews is now Deferred
[10:05:48] <duch_kazatel> you said something about the original code returning a promise.
[10:05:49] <zumba_addict> it's the same as this code you gave me - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8snh3gjj/
[10:06:00] <zumba_addict> yeah, look at the first line
[10:06:09] <zumba_addict> this.allPromises = [this.promise, this.secondPromise];
[10:06:11] <duch_kazatel> wut
[10:06:19] <duch_kazatel> okay - so how does this relate to getViews?
[10:06:40] <duch_kazatel> (you're assuming i know a lot more about your code than i do)
[10:06:54] <zumba_addict> k
[10:07:45] <zumba_addict> what happens is that when this.promise is done, it calls getViews which was previously a plain function, now converted into a deferred because of the issue i saw in safari
[10:08:06] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:08:10] <shoky> zumba_addict: i don't really see how promises/deferreds have to do with your core issue, something being undefined in safari
[10:08:16] <duch_kazatel> " so the deferred that I just added, I found out that it was also wrapped with the promise returned by BackboneJS"
[10:08:20] <shoky> if that's still the issue you're talking about
[10:08:33] <duch_kazatel> you're not relaly explaining yourself very well.  you need to back WAY up and clarify.
[10:08:37] <zumba_addict> k
[10:08:39] <zumba_addict> :)
[10:08:48] <zumba_addict> here is what I am thinking
[10:09:12] <zumba_addict> it's because there is a new issue saying the footer is undefined
[10:09:44] <zumba_addict> i think i see the issue now
[10:09:59] <zumba_addict> so both promises are done and it doesn't care what is inside the .done
[10:10:16] <zumba_addict> inside the .done is a new deferred
[10:10:28] <zumba_addict> which is the this.getViews
[10:10:52] <zumba_addict> now that this.allPromises is fullfilled, it will execute the code at the bottom
[10:11:06] <zumba_addict> it doesn't care if the deferred i added inside .done is fulfilled
[10:11:16] <zumba_addict> that's the problem i'm seeing
[10:13:15] <duch_kazatel> i feel like you need to make an abstracted fiddle to illustrate the problem.
[10:13:21] <zumba_addict> and it's weird that their doing a promise and not even using the return data
[10:13:34] <zumba_addict> this code - $.when(this.promise).done(_.bind(function() {
[10:13:42] <zumba_addict> i think it should be $.when(this.promise).done(_.bind(function(response) {
[10:13:47] <zumba_addict> then use response
[10:13:56] <zumba_addict> just like your example
[10:13:57] <duch_kazatel> if you need to use the data, sure?
[10:14:01] <zumba_addict> yup
[10:14:13] <duch_kazatel> if the promise resolves with the data.
[10:14:20] <zumba_addict> and I have never seen any single line of code that has function(response)
[10:14:25] <zumba_addict> k
[10:14:33] <zumba_addict> I agree with that
[10:14:49] <shoky> zumba_addict: show us the function getViews
[10:17:42] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict for what it's worth, there's nothing to "agree" with about my last statement.  the only way you can use the response like that is if the resolve call on the deferred actually passes that data.
[10:18:11] <zumba_addict> sorry, someone was here
[10:18:27] <zumba_addict> it's passing data that was in "this"
[10:18:31] <zumba_addict> got it
[10:18:42] <django_> for jquery UI can i do $('#makeMeDraggable div').draggable
[10:18:53] <django_> all children of #makeMeDraggable which are divs
[10:18:58] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:19:17] <shoky> better to give them a class though
[10:19:22] <duch_kazatel> ^
[10:19:30] <duch_kazatel> because it'll be any div, even divs within divs.
[10:20:17] <zumba_addict> I'll just remove the deferred that I added and just check if views is undefined like what I have earlier
[10:20:31] <shoky> zumba_addict: in case you didnt see - show us the function getViews  ;p
[10:20:34] <zumba_addict> however, I learned a lot from a deferred function
[10:20:40] <zumba_addict> oh
[10:21:01] <zumba_addict> it's a really simple function, no ajax, just object parsing and return
[10:21:33] <zumba_addict> then i wrapped it with $.Deferred()
[10:21:42] <zumba_addict> equal to duch_kazatel example
[10:22:45] <shoky> so simple you can't show it ?
[10:23:04] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:23:53] <django_> $('#dragGrape').draggable({alert('draggable')});
[10:23:56] <django_> unexpected string
[10:24:11] <shoky> does that look right to you, django_
[10:24:11] <duch_kazatel> that's not how you use that function./
[10:24:16] <django_> yes :s
[10:24:25] <duch_kazatel> {} is an object - key value pairs.
[10:24:25] <shoky> what is {alert()}
[10:24:38] <django_> oh you cant pass it anything?
[10:24:45] <duch_kazatel> not to an object.
[10:24:50] <duch_kazatel> you want the callback.
[10:25:03] <shoky> django_ look at the examples in the docs
[10:25:16] <duch_kazatel> https://jqueryui.com/draggable/#events
[10:27:23] <django_> i have .cont inside i have divs with images in side..i did: id='draggable' next to the .cont
[10:27:28] <django_> $('#draggable div img').draggable();
[10:27:36] <django_> getting this: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined
[10:28:31] <duch_kazatel> mixing and matching jquery and jquery ui versions.
[10:28:47] <duch_kazatel> update your jquery ui version.
[10:31:14] <duch_kazatel> fwiw that was a quick google search away :)
[10:31:23] <Hornet-Wing> shoky: ok, this time i've got it for real i think! http://jsfiddle.net/j3ccwLoh/6/
[10:31:53] <Lindrain> Hey. If I have a $.Deferred() and want to chain two handlers. Is var d = $.Deferred(); d.always(...); d.always(...); equivalent to d.always(...).always(...)?
[10:32:03] <Lindrain> I believe so, but want to make sure.
[10:32:15] <Hornet-Wing> because scroll seems to fire no matter what I might as well use it to reset the event switch.
[10:32:26] <duch_kazatel> Lindrain -> "Since deferred.always() returns the Deferred object, other methods of the Deferred object can be chained to this one, including additional .always() methods."
[10:32:51] <Lindrain> Yeah, but is the execution order identical in both cases?
[10:33:08] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:33:14] <duch_kazatel> oh, should be yes
[10:33:50] <Lindrain> Alright good
[10:36:35] <Dr-007> i'm preventing a <button> from submitting a form in a jquery onclick() function with e.preventDefault(); the button stopped submitting the form. which is good
[10:36:40] <Dr-007> now how do i submit the form?
[10:36:50] <Dr-007> i thought $(this).click()
[10:36:52] <duch_kazatel> hit the enter key in the form.
[10:36:54] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[10:36:55] <Dr-007> haha
[10:37:03] <duch_kazatel> bind to the form's submit handler.
[10:37:10] <duch_kazatel> prevent that depending on some external criteria.
[10:37:24] <Dr-007> but i need it to be on the button
[10:37:30] <duch_kazatel> why?
[10:37:35] <Dr-007> i'm showing a http://ethaizone.github.io/Bootstrap-Confirmation/
[10:37:36] <duch_kazatel> why not the entire form's submit?
[10:37:45] <Dr-007> on a 'delete' button
[10:37:47] <duch_kazatel> manually fire that instead of using the click.
[10:38:12] <Dr-007> huhmmzz
[10:38:20] <Dr-007> will you take a quick look if i pastebin it?
[10:38:23] <Dr-007> for a pointer
[10:38:27] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise a user can just hit "enter" and bypass your entire setup.
[10:38:37] <duch_kazatel> check out the docs for .trigger() and .on() for how to send data around.
[10:38:39] <duch_kazatel> pretty simple.
[10:38:42] <Dr-007> yeah, but enter saves the form
[10:38:47] <Dr-007> not delete
[10:38:53] <duch_kazatel> wat
[10:39:04] <duch_kazatel> then the button shouldn't be submitting the form....
[10:39:05] <Dr-007> there's multiple submit buttons :p
[10:39:10] <duch_kazatel> that's... not a good thing.
[10:39:26] <Dr-007> they're being recognized in php by the value of the button i think
[10:39:40] <duch_kazatel> the markup/js for that is wonky.
[10:39:40] <Dr-007> its pretty awesome actually
[10:39:43] <duch_kazatel> but okay.
[10:39:52] <Dr-007> ok
[10:39:55] <duch_kazatel> either way, you want to mess with the form submit.
[10:39:56] <duch_kazatel> not the click.
[10:40:01] <Dr-007> oki doki
[10:40:39] <Dr-007> this is it: http://pastebin.com/1EqXpyjn
[10:40:44] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[10:40:56] <duch_kazatel> standalone, etc.
[10:41:12] <duch_kazatel> also, el.click(); is a no-no :) don't use the DOM to proxy logic.
[10:41:15] <duch_kazatel> call functions instead.
[10:41:33] <Dr-007> how so?
[10:41:41] <Dr-007> el = $('.disable_vpn');
[10:41:44] <duch_kazatel> abstract the function out and call the function,
[10:42:00] <Dr-007> i dont understand what you're saying
[10:42:05] <Dr-007> abstract the function out?
[10:42:05] <duch_kazatel> the only case where that's OK to do is to .trigger() the submit.
[10:42:07] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[10:42:10] <duch_kazatel> so instead of .on('
[10:42:23] <duch_kazatel> err, .on('event', function() { console.log('lol') });
[10:42:45] <Dr-007> but this works, so why is it a no-no?
[10:42:50] <Dr-007> its exactly the same as:
[10:42:51] <duch_kazatel> you do var myFunction = function() {console.log('lol') }; then .on('event', myFunction);
[10:42:59] <duch_kazatel> then call myFunction() when you want that logic.
[10:43:03] <Dr-007> $('.disable_vpn').click() { console.log('lol'); } right?
[10:43:07] <duch_kazatel> because it's cleaner.  the DOM is not meant ot proxy your logic.
[10:43:38] <shoky> Hornet-Wing: ah nice one
[10:44:15] <Dr-007> the DOM?
[10:44:18] <Dr-007> heh
[10:44:23] <Dr-007> well.. call me stupid
[10:44:38] <Dr-007> but i still dont understand WHY :(
[10:44:39] <duch_kazatel> the DOM is the interface the browser gives you to work with HTML.
[10:44:43] <duch_kazatel> it's much, much cleaner.
[10:44:49] <duch_kazatel> separations on concern, easier to work with.
[10:45:07] <duch_kazatel> you end up calling functions explicitly, instead of the weird implicit call you're doingnow.
[10:45:17] <Dr-007> but why can't i use el.click(), but it is okay to do $('.disable_vpn').click() ?
[10:45:37] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[10:45:40] <duch_kazatel> you do neither.
[10:45:40] <Dr-007> could you provide a little example?
[10:45:44] <duch_kazatel> you always abstract out.
[10:46:03] <Dr-007> because i'm having problems 'destroying' the confirmation buttons
[10:46:14] <Dr-007> so i think what you're saying should fix that
[10:46:16] <duch_kazatel> what does that have to do with event binding?
[10:46:31] <Dr-007> i dont know!
[10:46:32] <Dr-007> lol
[10:46:35] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:46:39] <duch_kazatel> i didn't say anything about that part ;)
[10:46:46] <Dr-007> i'm a PHP nerd
[10:46:51] <django_> $( ".selector" ).draggable( "option", "containment", "parent" );
[10:46:57] <django_> how does it know if parent is id or class
[10:47:11] <Dr-007> sometimes i do a little jquery to make stuff better. but i'm no pro at it
[10:47:19] <django_> n/m
[10:47:21] <shoky> django_: parent is an element
[10:53:59] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, so this is what you mean i should do? -> http://pastebin.com/gMY5MJqU
[11:02:02] <django_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/jKcGCegx/
[11:02:07] <django_> how come that doesnt work
[11:02:16] <duch_kazatel> is it unemployed?
[11:08:19] <django_> lol
[11:08:32] <django_> i added drop:myFunc in in myFunc alert('called'
[11:08:35] <django_> nothing happens
[11:08:38] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[11:12:31] <django_> fixed
[11:12:39] <django_> damn syntax error lol
[11:12:48] <django_> drop: 'myFunc' instead of drop: myFunc
[11:47:36] <django_> http://pastebin.com/BEGjLwfv
[11:47:42] <django_> how does that handleDrop function work?
[11:47:44] <django_> with the event,ui
[12:03:58] <bbb_> test
[13:38:07] <plamb> what am i doing wrong here

[13:40:11] <plamb> that feel
[13:40:29] <plamb> same exact code in my project but its not working :(

[13:41:40] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[13:41:45] <duch_kazatel> does that ID actually exist on pageload?

[13:41:54] <plamb> no it doesnt
[13:41:56] <plamb> Lol1OL!oL!lo1
[13:42:17] <larzen> Question -- can I do something liket his var x = jQuery('.item');   jQuery('.someInner', x).addClass('test'); <-- is this possible?
[13:42:35] <larzen> so, basically perform a query on another jQuery result (array)
[13:42:43] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[13:42:51] <duch_kazatel> like, all .item that's also .someInner"?
[13:43:16] <larzen> so X houses the result of  jQuery('.item') -- which is an array of dom elements...
[13:43:23] <duch_kazatel> not an array.
[13:43:24] <plamb> thanks robert
[13:43:41] <larzen> then i do jQuery('.someInnerItgemthatLivesInsideOfX', x) <-- will this return things?
[13:44:04] <duch_kazatel> larzen that's an implicit .find() which isn't what you want.
[13:44:14] <duch_kazatel> unless i'm not understanding your description.
[13:44:28] <duch_kazatel> is .someInner a child element of x?
[13:44:35] <larzen> duch_kazatel: yes it is.
[13:44:44] <duch_kazatel> then yes, that will work, but you should use .find() instead.
[13:44:56] <larzen> duch_kazatel: and the result of the query stored in "x" is cached in that variable for future use.
[13:44:58] <duch_kazatel> the other syntax is awkward and just uses find under the hood.
[13:45:01] <larzen> ohh ok
[13:45:02] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[13:45:11] <duch_kazatel> just do the .find() in the first place then.
[13:45:54] <larzen> hmm, still doesn't work even with find
[13:46:06] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle?
[13:46:25] <larzen> yup one sec =)
[13:48:34] <larzen> duch_kazatel: fiddle works! hmm
[13:55:37] <duch_kazatel> weeeeelll then.
[14:08:31] <Kricir> does jquery accept += equations, I can't remember what they are called... or -= equations to apply to itself
[14:11:19] <borden> quick question. I noticed that jquery doesn't seem to support cors requests on IE9. You can get away with these requests if you use IE's XDomainRequest feature. Is there a plan to integrate this with $.ajax() or a reason why not?
[14:12:01] <borden> My apologies if this isn't the right place to ask
[14:13:27] <derstrom> Kricir: Are you referring to shorthand assignment operators? This is a JavaScript feature.
[14:13:50] <derstrom> They'll work fine in your jQuery code.
[14:14:03] <Kricir> so I can write var = 0; var += 5;
[14:14:25] <Kricir> so then it must be something else I am doing wrong...
[14:15:02] <derstrom> Can you put your code on jsfiddle so we can see?
[14:15:44] <Kricir> it's just a simple math equation I was testing, I just couldn't remember if jquery could do the shorthand math
[14:16:34] <Kricir> Is there a way to force a int value to be a decimal with two places even if they're .00
[14:17:20] <derstrom> There is no reason why it wouldn't. The only thing to watch out for (based on your question) is to convert any strings that are actually numbers into integers before doing assignment operations. i.e. parseInt($(this).val())
[14:17:33] <duch_kazatel> .toFixed()
[14:18:05] <duch_kazatel> native JS method for numbers
[14:18:50] <duch_kazatel> borden JQ 1.x supports CORS in old ie iirc.
[14:24:32] <borden> duch_kazatel i am using JQ 1.10
[14:25:30] <borden> and I seem to have to explicately use XDomainRequest instead of jQuery.ajax() on IE9 when doing cors requests
[14:25:45] <duch_kazatel> borden i forgot there's a case where ie9 and below fail - my bad.
[14:25:52] <borden> it's cool
[14:26:29] <borden> i bet it could be patched in. Is there an official way to request/suggest/volunteer adding this?
[14:26:49] <duch_kazatel> heh./
[14:27:02] <duch_kazatel> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8283
[14:27:16] <rhizome> what can i read to learn about moving from functions like "openModal($(...));" to defining them in terms of $(...).openModal?
[14:27:18] <duch_kazatel> was closed a looong time ago as a "not going to support in core"
[14:27:30] <duch_kazatel> rhizome learn.jquery.com has a plugin guide.
[14:27:39] <rhizome> thanks
[14:27:42] <duch_kazatel> rhizome but be aware that making plugins is a little...funky.
[14:27:57] <rhizome> hah. should i not really worry about it?
[14:28:02] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't.
[14:28:09] <rhizome> i actually have a more pressing question. not sure how i started on that one.
[14:28:14] <duch_kazatel> what's that question?
[14:29:06] <rhizome> i have $(document).on('click', '#foo a.bar', someFunc) and $(document).on('click', '#foo a', otherFunc) and the latter always seems to take precedence. how do i prevent that?
[14:29:18] <duch_kazatel> why are you using both?
[14:29:19] <rhizome> first one has a class on the a, second doesn't
[14:29:23] <duch_kazatel> why not combine into one?
[14:29:24] <rhizome> i don't know!
[14:29:38] <rhizome> and have the function decide?
[14:29:44] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[14:30:14] <rhizome> sounds good. the links just have differerent roles, so that's how that logic seeps in
[14:30:24] <rhizome> thanks
[14:30:32] <derstrom> just do .hasClass() if you need to do something when the class is "bar"
[14:30:47] <duch_kazatel> this is part of why delegated listeners on document are kind of a bad call.
[14:31:00] <rhizome> heh, what's the alternative?
[14:31:22] <duch_kazatel> lower in the document.
[14:31:41] <rhizome> i'm not sure i understand the spatial relationship
[14:32:03] <duch_kazatel> depends on your hierarchy, rhizome
[14:33:28] <rhizome> naturally. i just down know whether lower refers to being closer to the element itself, or more "global"
[14:33:42] <duch_kazatel> "lower" always means "closer to the element"
[14:33:51] <duch_kazatel> like, more widgetized.
[14:40:08] <borden> thanks for your help duch_kazatel
[14:40:12] <rhizome> gotcha
[14:40:12] <rhizome> in a way i think that's what i'm trying to do, but i'll try the single delegation thing first
[14:40:29] <duch_kazatel> i would avoid single delegation is it's two completely different actions.
[14:42:39] <rhizome> ok, so that leaves me with the more general case overriding the specific one, the #foo a clobbering #foo a.bar
[14:43:12] <duch_kazatel> why not give the ones that don't have the class a different class?
[14:43:24] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, can you make a basic fiddle to demonstrate the differences?
[14:43:30] <rhizome> yeah, i can wrap them
[14:51:38] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:53:04] <duch_kazatel> hello!
[14:53:10] <Azrael_-> i'm displaying some input-fields in a modal popup, but as soon as i close the popup and later submit the form, the input-fields of the popup aren't sent. why and how can i change this?
[14:53:33] <duch_kazatel> are the inputs actually in the form?
[14:53:39] <duch_kazatel> *at time of submission
[14:54:26] <Azrael_-> duch_kazatel: yes, if i didn't open the popup at all, then the inputs are sent, but as soon as i had it open once, they aren't sent any more. at the start i hide the div for the popup with "displa:none"
[14:55:38] <duch_kazatel> i'd need to see your code.
[14:56:06] <Azrael_-> one second
[14:58:04] <Azrael_-> http://pastebin.com/jHJgdb8u <-- hope this helps
[15:00:41] <sekyms> Is anyone familiar with an issue in IE 11 where find only returns the parent element, and none of the children?
[15:01:04] <duch_kazatel> sekyms that sounds off.  fiddle?
[15:01:26] <duch_kazatel> Azrael_- wat
[15:01:45] <Azrael_-> just building a fiddle
[15:02:01] <duch_kazatel> Azrael_- the reason you won't see data is because the inputs are empty or not actually apart of the form.
[15:02:04] <duch_kazatel> so that's the issue.
[15:02:07] <duch_kazatel> fix that and you're fine.
[15:05:13] <Azrael_-> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=9AlQwHGGLT
[15:05:24] <duch_kazatel> can you actually save it instead of the togetherjs version?
[15:05:31] <duch_kazatel> that always makes my browser freak out.
[15:05:33] <Azrael_-> currently getting "{"error": "Please use POST request"}"
[15:05:55] <Azrael_-> http://jsfiddle.net/w8uagp46/
[15:06:11] <duch_kazatel> uh
[15:06:16] <Azrael_-> doesn't seem to work, i just can't find out why
[15:06:23] <duch_kazatel> that's the css area.
[15:06:47] <Azrael_-> argh, yeah. sorry, not familiar with jsfiddle
[15:07:19] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/w8uagp46/1/
[15:09:51] <Azrael_-> ok, http://jsfiddle.net/w8uagp46/3/ <-- the save doesn't seem to be allowed
[15:10:13] <duch_kazatel> not in jsffiel.
[15:10:21] <duch_kazatel> but that's not what i'm worried about here.
[15:10:35] <Azrael_-> i'm open to all comments
[15:10:44] <Azrael_-> i know i'm not really good at js
[15:11:31] <duch_kazatel> so the issue is things are getting moved by dialog out of the form iirc.
[15:11:36] <duch_kazatel> can't remember exactly how that works.
[15:11:48] <duch_kazatel> but the inputs in the dialog are not the same as the inputs in the form.
[15:12:01] <duch_kazatel> so you need to copy those values over when you close the dialog.
[15:12:03] <Azrael_-> oh.. interesting
[15:12:09] <Azrael_-> hoped to avoid this
[15:12:34] <Azrael_-> need to hook into the closing-event if somebody uses the X-button :)
[15:13:40] <Azrael_-> fortunately the documentation is nice
[15:13:46] <Azrael_-> thanks for the hint
[15:19:07] <esaym153> is "$(document).ready(function() {..})" and "$(function(){...})" the same thing?
[15:19:14] <duch_kazatel> pretty much.
[15:19:21] <esaym153> didn't know that, hmm
[15:19:49] <esaym153> some online course I took basically stated to always use the $(document).ready(function() style
[15:19:55] <esaym153> I thought it had some reason
[15:20:01] <duch_kazatel> much clearer to newbies.
[15:21:21] <esaym153> k
[15:59:14] <rares> Hi, I am trying to create a new ticket on  http://bugs.jqueryui.com/newticket and I get "Submission rejected as potential spam (Akismet says content is spam, Maximum number of posts per hour for this IP (127.0.0.1) exceeded)". Is there a workaround?
[17:35:35] <scranorphio> Hey there. I am setting the css content attribute of a meta tag and trying to retrieve it in jQuery. This works great in chrome, but on ie 11 i am getting back "normal" instead of the value of the content attribute, which I can see is set correctly in the DOM inspector. Is there something I'm missing here? Is this an expected behavior?
[19:31:26] <sdwrage> hey all. Is it possible to do multiple .click(function(){...}); on the same element with different event handlers?
[19:42:49] <sdwrage> anyone around?
[19:44:24] <happyKatt> me
[19:44:38] <happyKatt> multiple .click functions w/ multiple event handlers?
[21:45:59] <halvors> Hi.
[21:46:17] <halvors> How can i select the first instance of a form? I have a class name for it.
[22:09:11] <Uhkis> $('.class').get(0);
[22:13:22] <halvors> Yeah, but if i want to select the form of the select box that w're in, how would i do that=
[22:14:12] <Uhkis> make a fiddle
[22:14:21] <Uhkis> ?demo
[22:14:21] <b-ot> Uhkis: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:44:19] <halvors> I have multiplie forms with the same class. I want to submit just the current one, just all of the forms, how whould i do that?
[22:52:56] <Uhkis> $(form).submit();
[22:54:42] <halvors> Where does that go?
[22:56:27] <Uhkis> again, make a fiddle
[23:04:09] <puneet28> hello
[23:04:47] <puneet28> Is it possible to drag and drop rows from excel file on to a html page so that the data dropped can be saved?? PLEASE HELP!
[23:04:49] <halvors> Uhkis: Will do :)
[23:08:15] <tash> Uhkis: picking up where I left off last night. https://jsfiddle.net/s1ornz8a/11/ - Is there a way to apply the title-border on page load, and not quite so bold ( double border ) on toggle?  Basically if there are no notes on load, don't show content-body-container, but also don't want the notes tab to look weird
[23:11:34] <Cork> puneet28: define "can be saved"?
[23:11:55] <halvors> Uhkis: Here is my jsfiddle, i want to do this but only submit the form that this checkbox i click is in :) http://jsfiddle.net/yd9k8nnc/
[23:13:05] <halvors> Is there a good way to do that? :) Right now it's submitting all the forms at once.
[23:15:57] <Cork> halvors: http://jsfiddle.net/yd9k8nnc/2/
[23:16:51] <Cork> halvors: http://jsfiddle.net/yd9k8nnc/3/ -- don't use this in side .ready it doesn't make any sense
[23:19:05] <toomus> Hi all
[23:25:47] <halvors> Cork: Thanks, but the problem with that is that the "$(this).closest('form').trigger('submit');" is not posting my form, nothing at all happends.
[23:26:02] <halvors> Also the alert is not called from the on submit funciton.
[23:26:32] <Cork> halvors: uh, the alter doesn't trigger for you in that jsfiddle??
[23:27:33] <halvors> In fiddle it does, but not in my actual code.
[23:27:41] <halvors> Doing exactly the same...
[23:27:48] <Cork> halvors: well then you have to find what differs in your page
[23:27:54] <halvors> Nothing at all.
[23:27:57] <Cork> halvors: you can't be doing the same thing
[23:28:01] <Cork> cause then it would work
[23:30:46] <halvors> Cork: Any ideas?
[23:31:03] <Cork> halvors: ya, like i said you have to check what you do different
[23:31:21] <Cork> ex if you load the forms dynamically for example
[23:32:29] <halvors> Cork: Seems like some other script is interfering here.
[23:32:34] <halvors> Thanks for help :)
[23:33:18] <Cork> ya, problem someone doing return false in an event handler
[23:33:25] <Cork> *probably*
[23:34:22] <toomus> I don't know why Opera and Safari remove my cookie set yesterday. Chrome doesnt't.
[23:34:57] <Cork> browsers are getting more and more aggressive at removing cookies
[23:35:04] <Cork> it is used for tracking way to much
[23:36:13] <halvors> Cork. Hmm seems like removing all other scripts that jquery didn't do the trick.
[23:36:29] <halvors> Only the example from jsfiddle and jquery and still doesn work :(
[23:37:03] <toomus> I set cookie value when user logs in. And when he back tomorrow is still logged in, but cookie is undefined.
[23:38:20] <halvors> Cork: Any idea what to do?
[23:38:25] <Cork> ...
[23:38:29] <Cork> ya, problem someone doing return false in an event handler <--
[23:38:45] <Cork> opps wrong line
[23:39:11] <Cork> halvors: i'm not psychic i can't read the code you haven't shown me...
[23:39:33] <Cork> halvors: you have to do one of two things 1) reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[23:39:45] <Cork> or 2) figure out where your code differ from the fiddle
[23:39:49] <halvors> I could show you if you want :)
[23:40:07] <Cork> find i could give it a quick look
[23:40:17] <Cork> but i'm not digging through a rats nest page...
[23:40:36] <halvors> Well, i reproduced the same code on jsfiddle, then it work just fine.
[23:40:50] <Cork> if it does then you haven't reproduced the same code
[23:41:01] <Cork> code is code, it is reproducable when it does the same thing
[23:41:07] <halvors> And tried with a simple page on my webserver, then it works as well.
[23:41:14] <Cork> if it isn't reproducable, it isn't the same code
[23:41:58] <halvors> If i only have the javescript from your jsfiddle and jquery there is no other javascripts interfering and no possible way that there could be event handler returning false...
[23:42:03] <halvors> You agree with that?
[23:42:53] <Cork> if you only have the code from the jsfiddle and nothing else you will not have jquery loaded in the page
[23:44:01] <Cork> halvors: do you want me to look at the page or not?
[23:45:17] <halvors> Cork: Well, it's much PHP code as well. But i could pinpoint to the actual page.
[23:45:51] <halvors> Just notice that i'm, using a "include script" in PHP. So that the query script is defined in another file than the actual page.
[23:46:10] <halvors> https://github.com/InfectedLan/InfectedCrew/blob/fix/jquery-issues/v2/site.php
[23:46:24] <halvors> https://github.com/InfectedLan/InfectedCrew/blob/fix/jquery-issues/v2/pages/event-checklist.php
[23:46:38] <Cork> i'm not reading your php scripts...
[23:46:39] <halvors> https://github.com/InfectedLan/InfectedCrew/blob/fix/jquery-issues/v2/scripts/event-checklist.js
[23:46:50] <Cork> if you want me to check something it has to be the rendered html
[23:47:10] <halvors> I see.
[23:47:16] <halvors> See line 50 - 67 in first file.
[23:47:21] <Cork> no
[23:47:31] <Cork> either give me a ling to the live page
[23:47:50] <Cork> or open the live page and save the view source to a file and give me that
[23:48:03] <Cork> never ever look at server side code and expect to see what happens client side
[23:48:07] <halvors> ok
[23:48:15] <Cork> ling==link
[23:49:41] <halvors> Cork: Here you go: https://gist.github.com/halvors/b38e7fcad00d16ae7f00
[23:50:48] <Cork> there is no jquery code in that page, or any reference to event-checklist
[23:51:01] <Cork> halvors: do you even know how this page sticks together?
[23:51:09] <halvors> And here: https://gist.github.com/halvors/065348878207eabc8018
[23:51:10] <halvors> Yeah.
[23:51:43] <halvors> See line 74: https://gist.github.com/halvors/b38e7fcad00d16ae7f00#file-gistfile1-txt-L74
[23:51:45] <Cork> also "no other js" i see 9 script tags in that page...
[23:52:00] <halvors> I tried removing them, could try again, 2 sec.
[23:52:14] <Cork> so ya, that one is way to complex to solve by just looking at the html
[23:52:27] <Cork> it needs to be running to tell why it breaks
[23:53:14] <Cork> halvors: again either a live link or a jsfiddle reproducing the problem
[23:53:23] <Cork> dead text dumps won't help
[23:55:10] <halvors> Cork: This is my simple example reproducing the problem.
[23:55:12] <halvors> https://crew.test.infected.no/v2/test.php
[23:55:19] <halvors> But that works just fine.
[23:55:43] <halvors> Could this be related to non-js stuff as well?
[23:55:51] <Cork> you're running legacy html
[23:55:59] <halvors> No?
[23:56:00] <Cork> add the doctype <!doctype html>
[23:56:14] <halvors> Yeah for that example, i know.
[23:56:32] <Cork> you should never skip the doctype
[23:56:47] <Cork> the browser goes into legacy mode and does a lot of weird things
[23:56:48] <halvors> I do have the "<!DOCTYPE html>" on the actual page that is not working.
[23:57:13] <Uhkis> tash: https://jsfiddle.net/s1ornz8a/12/ like this?
[23:58:27] <halvors> Cork: Indeed? Lower or uppercase doesn't matter right? For the doctype i mean.
[23:58:34] <Cork> ya
