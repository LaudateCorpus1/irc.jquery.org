[03:20:48] <Rockwood> hi guyz
[06:07:23] <Ice_Strike> var oversell = $(".oversell-inline-input").is(":checked") ? 1 : 0;
[06:07:34] <Ice_Strike> why it return 1 even it is not checked?
[06:08:22] <Cork> $(".oversell-inline-input").length == $(".oversell-inline-input").length ?
[06:08:30] <Cork> opps typo
[06:08:33] <Cork> $(".oversell-inline-input:checked").length == $(".oversell-inline-input").length ?
[06:08:49] <Ice_Strike> Hmm
[06:09:30] <Ice_Strike> That don't seem right
[06:09:35] <Cork> :D
[06:10:11] <Cork> Ice_Strike: what i meant by that test is; make sure .oversell-inline-input matches the amount of elements your expecting
[06:10:39] <Ice_Strike> I see.
[06:15:30] <Ice_Strike> I know what I did wrong!! :)
[06:15:38] <Ice_Strike> I forgot to add , blockTr)
[06:15:48] <Ice_Strike> $(".oversell-inline-input:checked", blockTr)
[06:22:12] <rooty_> can anyone help me out with my array map? https://jsfiddle.net/y4f0ffmg/1/
[06:22:28] <rooty_> Need to rearrange it slightly. Need both values in the array...
[06:23:20] <Cork> rooty_: both values in the array?
[06:23:25] <Cork> what do you mean?
[06:23:38] <rooty_> Check my comment in that jsfiddle Cork
[06:23:59] <Cork> except they make no sense
[06:24:10] <Cork> you want to convert the object to an array?
[06:24:19] <rooty_> yeah
[06:24:19] <Cork> so you get a multi dimentional array?
[06:24:22] <rooty_> indeed
[06:24:25] <Cork> just use Object.values()
[06:24:41] <rooty_> Ah
[06:24:46] <rooty_> That makes more sense..
[06:25:48] <rooty_> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/y4f0ffmg/2/
[06:38:39] <netSys> Hello all
[06:40:01] <netSys> How I can get a value typed into <input type="text" wihout send it uses ID. If I use tbody input[type="text"] shows value. But, I want to perform a loop that's tells all values of inputs.
[06:42:07] <netSys> For example, If I use alert($("#input-1").attr('value')); shows undefined. .val() shows same. However, If I use alert($("tbody input[type='text']").val() shows me the one only value of course. The mean is shows all values inside at loop
[06:50:23] <netSys> I'm trying with .each(function) this show all input
[06:52:02] <Cork> netSys: .attr grabs the attribute for the element
[06:52:21] <Cork> you NEVER want to grab attributes for states of elements (and normally should avoid it)
[06:52:27] <Cork> what you want to use is .prop()
[06:52:35] <Cork> though .val() is a shorthand for that
[06:53:27] <Cork> var values = $.map($('input[type="text"]'), function(elm) { return elm.value; });
[06:53:35] <Cork> will give you an array
[07:05:10] <netSys> Cork: thanks a lot
[07:35:10] <codecutter> why does the color disappear when you minimise the chart screen (right)? https://jsfiddle.net/pLgctdng/
[07:36:41] <codecutter> make '1y' is selected then try minimising the that chart (extend screen to see color)
[07:36:46] <codecutter> make sure*
[08:01:53] <jerit> any reason why this isn't working? I'm trying to replace &lt; &gt; with < > respectively
[08:01:56] <jerit> https://jsfiddle.net/yrbbo54d/
[08:05:18] <pavonia> jerit: You are only replacing it locally and discarding the result, you have to set the replaced string as the new text for the element
[08:09:28] <jerit> meh fixed it server-side
[08:09:44] <jerit> probably better since I've already got a lot of client-side stuff going on anyway
[08:25:04] <codecutter> anyone?
[08:28:56] <codecutter> here it is again https://pastebin.com/3z8jfN8Q
[08:29:53] <Cork> jerit: .text() will replace &lt; and &gt; with < and > before you get it
[08:30:27] <Cork> jerit: also replace on the result from text() won't modify the content in the page, it returns a string that isn't connected to the displayed content
[08:30:50] <pavonia> codecutter: I don't see any colors in that chart
[08:31:07] <codecutter> right.
[08:31:15] <codecutter> thats the iissue
[08:31:24] <Caspan> can you register a listener on a .click function?
[08:31:36] <Caspan> that way the listener is only there is if it clicked on first
[08:31:47] <codecutter> https://pastebin.com/xzCjANQg
[08:32:54] <codecutter> pavonia: to see color, make the screen size lager but selecting divider and moving it left
[08:33:02] <codecutter> by*
[08:35:56] <pavonia> Caspan: You could unbind the handler in the click event handler
[08:38:56] <codecutter> Cork: any suggestions? https://pastebin.com/xzCjANQg
[08:41:08] <Cork> codecutter: => #highcharts
[08:41:15] <Cork> this channel is for jquery
[08:41:23] <codecutter> those guys are dead
[08:41:49] <codecutter> nvm
[08:41:55] <Cork> then http://forum.highcharts.com
[08:42:03] <Cork> its offtopic for this channel
[08:43:06] <Cork> Caspan: you can, but i would recommend controlling it by a class or a variable value
[08:43:24] <Cork> Caspan: it gets quite messy if you do a lot of adding and removing of event handlers to control code flow
[09:00:18] <Caspan> ok
[09:04:29] <robinsmidsrod> I'm trying to get this code to work? https://gist.github.com/robinsmidsrod/5267a8fc00454320275591ced60c7198 - can you give me some pointers?
[09:04:52] <robinsmidsrod> it's basically an audio player that should start playing the next audio file when the previous finishes
[09:06:27] <robinsmidsrod> I'm thinking that I need to do something funky with .get(..) or .index(...) together with $(this) and the selector, but I can't find out how I find the array of matched elements
[09:07:10] <robinsmidsrod> basically I need to find my own index in the array of matched elements, add one to it and trigger the click on that other DOM element
[09:13:26] <Cork> robinsmidsrod: .audio_mpeg matches what?
[09:13:43] <Cork> (would recommend creating a jsfiddle with the html and the js related to the question)
[09:14:22] <robinsmidsrod> Cork: just a div that responds to the portfolio:finish event, but it's dynamically injected
[09:15:02] <Cork> robinsmidsrod: if there is just a div how do you expect to find a button?
[09:15:09] <robinsmidsrod> Cork: the audio player itself is a bit complicated, and the only thing I'm trying to figure out is how to trigger and event on the _next_ item that was matched in the delegated event handler
[09:15:23] <robinsmidsrod> Cork: it's the div with the UI for the player
[09:15:40] <robinsmidsrod> the find().click() part is not the one I have problems with
[09:15:50] <Cork> ok, you will have to wait for a psychic that can read your mind, or provide the needed info
[09:16:11] <Cork> i can't tell you what you need to do to find something i don't know where it is
[09:16:30] <robinsmidsrod> I'm trying to rewrite the example to something that can be tested
[09:21:07] <robinsmidsrod> Cork: I've updated the example to not reference third-party code: https://gist.github.com/robinsmidsrod/5267a8fc00454320275591ced60c7198
[09:21:55] <robinsmidsrod> so with that example I basically want the code to trigger clicks on all three links if I click link1, but only link2 and 3 if I click link2
[09:22:48] <Cork> robinsmidsrod: check if you have more structure you can depend on then that
[09:22:56] <Cork> cause currently you have no wrapping info at all
[09:23:44] <robinsmidsrod> Cork: well, that's what I'm trying to work out how to avoid
[09:24:29] <Cork> robinsmidsrod: what i tried to tell you is the example was too much a construct and to far removed from the problem you're actually trying to solve
[09:24:29] <robinsmidsrod> the question is "when I'm at that first A element, how can I find the next A element inside the root (body)
[09:24:51] <robinsmidsrod> inside the event handler
[09:24:54] <Cork> if any element A in body is fine then sure
[09:25:04] <Cork> but that will mean it can go outside the player
[09:25:19] <robinsmidsrod> well, I want to use the selector specified in the .on() call
[09:25:24] <Cork> $('a').eq($('a').index(this) + 1)
[09:26:13] <robinsmidsrod> ...and the root
[09:26:26] <Cork> but ya, again if you want help provide a useful set of dom elements
[09:31:59] <robinsmidsrod> Cork: well, thank you for your help, that was indeed what I needed to get it to work. Here is the code working the way I need: https://gist.github.com/robinsmidsrod/5267a8fc00454320275591ced60c7198
[09:42:23] <Caspan> https://3bit.io/tjx98
[09:42:27] <Caspan> having a small issue
[09:42:37] <Caspan> i have a TR that has a calss .clickable on it
[09:42:55] <Caspan> i want to then add a class called .selected to it
[09:43:00] <Caspan> or remove it if its there
[09:43:55] <Caspan> i dont think i have this wuite right
[09:44:11] <Caspan> ohh  think I am selecting and then listining for children on clicks..
[09:46:13] <Caspan> any ideas
[09:46:27] <Caspan> $('.clickable') selecte the TR
[09:46:32] <Caspan> selects the TR
[09:46:51] <Caspan> .on('click', '.selected', function () {   then i want to do that is the TR has .selected
[09:46:58] <Caspan> has that class
[09:49:12] <Caspan> it seems like ON only will select decedents
[09:49:17] <Caspan> time to rethink
[09:49:34] <Caspan> either that add it to the tbody
[09:54:47] <Cork> Caspan: please create a jsfiddle with the htmp + script you want to ask about
[10:22:07] <__hassoon__> anyone knows of some image gallery management plugin that allows you to select an image from an availabe gallery, zoom through it and move over its zoomed-in/zoomed-out surface ?
[10:22:34] <__hassoon__> i've been googling but i end up with unrelated solutions
[10:37:58] <fuchstronaut> Is there something special I have to do to make jQuery work iwth browserify?
[10:38:05] <fuchstronaut> Simply importing it doesn't seem to work
[10:42:25] <z1haze_work> how are you including it
[10:43:35] <z1haze_work> normally, something like window.$ = window.jQuery = require('jquery'); will work
[10:58:26] <MassDebates> taplar you around?
[10:58:30] <MassDebates> Ah shit
[11:01:18] <hlve> doesn't look like it
[11:12:56] <keka> anybody used jqgrid ?
[11:56:59] <kbeflo> how would you go combining two posts in one block? currently online one line posts https://hastebin.com/egifopoyep.cs
[11:57:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:57:39] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[11:58:12] <robertmaxrees> use an object theere.
[12:00:17] <robertmaxrees> kbeflo
[12:00:21] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/c01e8b82ae2a
[12:01:33] <kbeflo> wait i'll go try
[12:03:02] <kbeflo> robertmaxrees, you're awesome. thanks man
[12:07:50] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[12:35:30] <z1haze_work> if I have an click listener for an <a>, can i have a click listener on a <span> inside the <a> without triggering the click event on the <a>?
[12:35:58] <z1haze_work> without doing some stuff like if(e.target .. ) { return false } kinda stuff
[12:36:05] <taplar> you can stopPropagation() on the span event
[12:37:15] <z1haze_work> thanks
[13:36:18] <bjsnider> i don't understand the point of the var elem = $( this ); lines in the documentation
[13:36:25] <bjsnider> why bother?
[13:36:45] <taplar_lunch> if you are doing $(this) a lot, it saves on jquery overhead
[13:37:07] <taplar_lunch> also if you are wanting to ensure context within another nested function that is one way of doing it
[13:38:40] <bjsnider> yes, but the documentation usually has simple functions, with one line or two, often using alert or console.log
[13:38:56] <bjsnider> but, whatever tickles your funny bone
[13:39:42] <taplar> less over head is typically a good thing
[13:42:41] <bjsnider> by overhead you mean memory use?
[13:43:15] <taplar> i mean every time you do $() it creates a completely new jquery object, with all the methods extended onto it and everything.
[13:43:30] <taplar> all the $.fn methods that is
[14:02:18] <MassDebates> taplar: got that cloth demo
[14:02:30] <MassDebates> taplar:  possibly? I'm looking to compare fiddle and codepen again
[14:56:59] <taplar> tons of stuff to do today.  can't play much
[14:57:07] <robertmaxrees> i hear that.
[14:57:10] <taplar> i got a bullet list on my white board of shit to do, lol
[14:58:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm exploring code quality tools for scss today
[15:03:20] <bjsnider> i guess i could use on load instead of document.ready?
[15:03:28] <robertmaxrees> fwut
[15:03:32] <robertmaxrees> *wut
[15:03:42] <robertmaxrees> you skipped the beginning and middle parts to that question bjsnider
[15:04:23] <bjsnider> i don't think i can use delegation with doc.ready
[15:04:27] <bjsnider> i think i need on.something
[15:04:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:04:46] <robertmaxrees> you can use delegation with document reayd just fine.
[15:04:52] <robertmaxrees> .on() is how you use delegation.
[15:05:48] <robertmaxrees> you just have to make sure the element you're binding to exists and that it's an ancestor to the element you cared about.
[15:06:02] <bjsnider> there is no event
[15:06:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:06:17] <bjsnider> it's a method, not an event
[15:06:24] <robertmaxrees> what is?
[15:06:46] <robertmaxrees> did you ever share that code out yesterday?
[15:06:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah, looks like you did.
[15:07:10] <bjsnider> https://jsfiddle.net/8maeesfy/
[15:07:24] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you're trying to initialize autocomplete on an element that doesn't yet exist?
[15:07:55] <bjsnider> a new copy that doesn't exist
[15:08:06] <robertmaxrees> so how are you making the copy?
[15:08:43] <robertmaxrees> because traditionally the way you handle that is by selecting the element when you create it and initialize.
[15:08:58] <bjsnider> it's just a button with some jquery
[15:09:26] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you'll do it inside that event handler.
[15:13:08] <hlve> robertmaxrees, you're an event handler
[15:13:13] <robertmaxrees> OH MAN.
[15:14:34] <hlve> :P
[15:23:08] <Caspan> https://3bit.io/bejaf
[15:23:29] <Caspan> i am using that to successfully hide some table rows under the thead tag
[15:23:50] <Caspan> i am curious if there is a way to say only toggle items below this selected item
[15:24:02] <Caspan> i know i should use $this but how would i use it in this case
[15:24:07] <robertmaxrees> depends on what "selected item" means
[15:24:15] <robertmaxrees> and how it relates to this js.
[15:24:27] <Caspan> $('.PaidTable tr').toggle("slow")
[15:24:42] <Caspan> that is very spacific to the table
[15:24:51] <robertmaxrees> right, not helpful because i don't know how that relates to your html.
[15:24:57] <Caspan> I want to make it relative to the table head that was jsut clicked
[15:24:59] <robertmaxrees> show us that part, too :)
[15:25:11] <robertmaxrees> is .PaidTable tr a child of the thead?
[15:25:36] <Caspan> its the class for the tbody
[15:25:56] <robertmaxrees> so a sibling of the thead that was clicked?
[15:26:03] <Caspan> i basically want to toggle all TR elements under the tbody of that table that was jsut clicked
[15:26:20] <robertmaxrees> can you share your markup?
[15:26:28] <Caspan> sure ill try to mock it up
[15:26:28] <robertmaxrees> this'll go 100x faster, promise :)
[15:26:36] <Caspan> i agree sorry i know better
[15:27:04] <Caspan> what is the place called to show the mock up?
[15:27:08] <Caspan> i always forget the site
[15:27:21] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.
[15:27:21] <Caspan> fiddle
[15:27:24] <Caspan> thats it\
[15:27:30] <robertmaxrees> or you could just use that service ytou just used.
[15:34:45] <Caspan> thats my site
[15:34:51] <Caspan> not very good for doign this stuff
[15:35:00] <Caspan> i jsut use it for simple shares so that it expires
[15:36:09] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/qr46r7jv/
[15:36:16] <Caspan> okay so if you look at that fiddle
[15:36:22] <Caspan> i hide the paid table
[15:36:37] <Caspan> then when you click on the header it toggles all thr TR tags to show below it
[15:37:17] <Caspan> i want to write a single statement so that it will work for all tables that have a class of collapsible
[15:37:29] <Caspan> insted of write the same code 4 times for 4 different tables
[15:38:01] <Caspan> so when the user clicks on $('.collapsible thead')
[15:38:28] <Caspan> $('.PaidTable tr').toggle("slow")   that i want to be relative to the table they just  clicked on..
[15:39:18] <Caspan> so basically   $(this) all trs below the thead tag  .toggle("slow")
[15:39:42] <Caspan> robertmaxrees: ^
[15:41:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:41:34] <robertmaxrees> sorry was away.
[15:41:45] <robertmaxrees> so first off you're missing that collapsible class on alkl the other containerTables
[15:42:00] <Caspan> $($(this) + 'tbody tr').toggle("slow")
[15:42:04] <Caspan> yes sorry
[15:42:07] <Caspan> not there yet
[15:42:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:42:12] <robertmaxrees> should be.
[15:42:20] <Caspan> 2 seconds
[15:42:35] <robertmaxrees> second, what's the generic class you can replace .PaidTable with?
[15:42:52] <robertmaxrees> ClickableTableBody ?
[15:43:41] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/qr46r7jv/1/
[15:43:46] <Caspan> there classes have been added
[15:44:10] <robertmaxrees> the easiest way would be to go up to the table and then use .find() from there.
[15:44:14] <Caspan> now if you click any header it will toggle the Paid bills
[15:44:15] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('table')
[15:44:36] <robertmaxrees> but you need to use a generic class to find the TRs you care about.
[15:44:47] <Caspan> they are all under tbodt
[15:44:50] <Caspan> tbody
[15:44:56] <robertmaxrees> then you can use that.
[15:45:02] <Caspan> so any TRs under tbody
[15:45:07] <robertmaxrees> then there you go.
[15:45:10] <robertmaxrees> ezpz
[15:45:35] <Caspan> closset table will go up?
[15:45:40] <Caspan> will match up?
[15:45:58] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/closest/
[15:50:14] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[15:53:29] <tocka> Hi guys :) I need to make this one page shop, could you maybe suggest something? :|
[15:53:30] <tocka> https://www.dropbox.com/s/8x1c3z91xb7915f/Screenshot%202017-03-28%2022.52.54.png?dl=0
[15:53:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:53:48] <robertmaxrees> what are we suggesting?
[15:55:24] <hlve> I suggest you get into the pet business, tocka. I hear it's profitable. People love the ever loving shit out of dogs.
[15:55:31] <hlve> Suggestion. made.
[15:55:38] <tocka> hehe
[15:55:42] <tocka> good suggestion is good
[15:55:44] <tocka> i guess..
[15:55:44] <tocka>  :|
[15:56:03] <robertmaxrees> tocka but seriously - what are you looking for?
[15:56:05] <hlve> robertmaxrees,  did I just get hehe'd.
[15:56:14] <robertmaxrees> that's a really broad question >.>
[15:56:18] <tocka> Im looking for a basket/cart plugin
[15:56:20] <tocka> or something like that :|
[15:56:29] <robertmaxrees> not really a good place for that.
[15:56:39] <tocka> Well.. I thought I could try asking
[15:56:41] <hlve> Idk if you understand web development if you think there's a plugin for that.
[15:56:41] <hlve> lol
[15:56:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:56:58] <tocka> a plugin would save a lot of time :)
[15:57:01] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i'm sure somebody's made a WP cart plugin or something.
[15:57:06] <robertmaxrees> but that's really not for this channel tbh.
[15:57:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in a channel for whatever backend you're using.
[15:57:21] <tocka> Thats the point, i dont want a WP plugin :)
[15:57:28] <hlve> Oh, wordpress. sure. Those are plugins. but a jQuery 'plugin' isn't really a feature-adding solution
[15:57:31] <tocka> I thought there might be just a jQuery/js thing
[15:57:33] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:57:37] <robertmaxrees> not for an entire cart page.
[15:57:43] <tocka> FAQ
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> not really something you'd want to power via frontend js
[15:57:46] <tocka> i mean fuk
[15:57:46] <tocka> :|
[15:58:06] <tocka> thanks :)
[15:58:17] <hlve> Look into Shopping cart solutions, tocka. Then you implement them using their API and custom jQuery/vanilla JS
[15:58:26] <robertmaxrees> or just build your own.
[15:58:39] <hlve> That too. but if you think that a plugin does that kind of thing, chances are, you don't know what goes into that.
[15:58:41] <hlve> lol
[15:58:45] <hlve> Not trying to be a dick.
[15:58:59] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just popping out suggestions.
[15:59:05] <robertmaxrees> It's not like I work in ecom or anything ;)
[15:59:20] <tocka> well i tried asking and i got my answers
[15:59:25] <tocka> keeping the pet shop idea tho
[15:59:26] <tocka> haha
[15:59:32] <hlve> <;]
[16:11:30] <Caspan> robertmaxrees: $(this).closest('table').find('tbody tr').toggle("slow")
[16:11:33] <Caspan> :) :) :)
[16:11:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd use classes instead, but sure.
[16:12:14] <Caspan> my tables are all structured the same way with a head and foot to them
[16:12:23] <Caspan> but you are correct i should select them by class
[16:12:23] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[16:12:27] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:12:35] <Caspan> be spacific with selects
[16:12:39] <Caspan> that way you get what you want
[16:13:00] <robertmaxrees> more like "use classes that describe your content so things make more sense.
[16:13:08] <Caspan> that too
[16:13:51] <robertmaxrees> less about specificity
[16:16:10] <Caspan> now i just have to use ajax to remember the states of the tables on page changes
[16:16:14] <Caspan> :)
[16:22:52] <Caspan> now if only you could do slide in and outs fo tables i would be really happy
[16:23:08] <Caspan> any other ideas then fading them to animate their fading?
[16:23:24] <robertmaxrees> use accordions instead.
[16:23:33] <robertmaxrees> have the headings not be part of the table.
[16:23:35] <Caspan> can you do that on tables?
[16:23:42] * hlve shudders
[16:23:43] <hlve> Tables.
[16:23:52] <robertmaxrees> nest the table under a div and have that be the content.
[16:23:58] <Caspan> its tabliture data i know its a necessay evil for this personal project
[16:23:59] <robertmaxrees> tables are fine if you use them for tabular data.
[16:30:30] <Caspan> i could use divs and jquery to size all them the same but man that woudl be a pain to maintain
[16:30:41] <robertmaxrees> which is why you don't do that.
[16:30:58] <Caspan> :)
[16:53:43] <jquery251> Hi everyone, I was reading over the jquery docs for 'promise()' but still don't quite understand what it's used for, could someone explain further? So far the only thing I think it would work for is to run a timeout function until the promise is resolved?
[16:53:52] <robertmaxrees> ajax.
[16:54:01] <robertmaxrees> ajax uses deferreds (which are promises)
[16:54:18] <jquery251> You don't have to be on ajax to use it though, correct?
[16:54:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:54:40] <robertmaxrees> you could use it for all kinds of things where you want to only do something after one or more other things have happened.
[16:55:16] <jquery251> So it's like a stop in your functions? So it won't run any other functions until the promise is resolved?
[16:55:18] <robertmaxrees> say you wanna launch something on click, but only if an ajax call finished.  or they did some other action on page.
[16:55:23] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:55:26] <robertmaxrees> it's an alternative to callbacks.
[16:55:49] <robertmaxrees> it's for things that happen in an asynchronous/out of order manner.
[16:56:28] <jquery251> so if I wanted to a run a function (only after an object is appended) I would want to use promise when checking if the div exists?
[16:56:53] <robertmaxrees> in that case i'd just run your logic in the thing that appends the function.
[16:56:58] <jquery251> er, well stop a running function, only after the div returns true
[16:56:59] <robertmaxrees> since you'd resolve it there anyway.
[16:57:08] <robertmaxrees> promises don't stop anything.
[16:57:12] <robertmaxrees> your code still normally runs.
[16:57:17] <robertmaxrees> it's just a different way to register callbacks.
[16:57:42] <jquery251> but if the promise gets resolved, will it stop the function that it's a callback to?
[16:57:52] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[16:57:57] <robertmaxrees> it has nothing to do with starting/stopping code.
[16:58:24] <jquery251> Is it the same as setting a var to true/false?
[16:58:35] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:58:39] <jquery251> shit
[16:58:48] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to solve?
[16:59:13] <jquery251> Nothing at the moment, I was just looking over some code someone wrote to check when a user is logged in
[16:59:26] <robertmaxrees> any ajaxy operations in there?
[16:59:45] <jquery251> (we load add a class on a nav if logged in) and promise was used to check for the class over and over, until it existed
[16:59:59] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:00:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange way to do that.
[17:00:07] <taplar> oh, so they made a promise and logically resolved it?
[17:00:13] <jquery251> Yeah
[17:00:18] <robertmaxrees> that's not checking over and over
[17:00:24] <robertmaxrees> something else is manually resolving that.
[17:00:32] <jquery251> well it was, cause it was a callback function
[17:00:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:00:42] <jquery251> then once the length of div returned > 1
[17:00:43] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[17:00:47] <jquery251> the promise got resolved
[17:01:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/voa5us94/
[17:01:54] <robertmaxrees> here's a contrived example.
[17:02:15] <robertmaxrees> that setTimeout could be an ajax call, another event, etc.
[17:03:04] <jquery251> https://jsfiddle.net/hsreby0a/
[17:03:18] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad way to do that.
[17:03:20] <robertmaxrees> wowzer.
[17:04:20] <jquery251> I didn't write it, but should I not use it as an example to learn from?
[17:04:25] <taplar> is resolve/reject in that case a window method?
[17:04:39] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't imo.
[17:04:52] <robertmaxrees> jquery251 also, read the MDN docs on promises since this is using native ones.
[17:04:56] <jquery251> Im not sure taplar
[17:05:04] <jquery251> Awesome, thanks for the help guys!
[17:05:26] <taplar> i don't see it in the docs
[17:05:31] <taplar> that's just werid
[17:05:33] <jquery251> gotta run to a meeting!
[17:05:37] <robertmaxrees> see what in the docs?
[17:05:55] <taplar> reject/resolve on window
[17:06:21] <robertmaxrees> they're only available within Promise()
[17:06:25] <taplar> ln 8/12/16 not being called on a promise/deferred threw me off
[17:06:25] <robertmaxrees> you pass them in.
[17:06:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, look at line 2.
[17:06:36] <robertmaxrees> you pass 'em in.
[17:06:44] <taplar> aaaaah, gotcha
[17:18:18] <dandanrevolution> I'm using a little script to make my div clickable:
[17:18:19] <dandanrevolution> $(".singleAlbum").click(function(){ window.location=$(this).find("a").attr("href"); return false; });
[17:18:46] <dandanrevolution> but can't figure out how to skip it if it doesn't find the a tag
[17:19:10] <taplar> as a single line you mean?
[17:19:21] <dandanrevolution> Doesn't have to be a single line
[17:19:43] <taplar> so you can do .length off of the find to see if it is found
[17:20:06] <dandanrevolution> There's a bunch of different divs with the class .singleAlbum, some don't have a tags
[17:20:08] <dandanrevolution> so shouldn't be clickable
[17:20:31] <taplar> so you don't want to even bind on those?
[17:20:45] <taplar> why not give another class to those that actually are applicable for the logic?
[17:20:48] <dandanrevolution> the code should only work on those with a tags
[17:21:04] <dandanrevolution> Oh... didn't think of that
[17:26:43] <dandanrevolution> Nice. Thanks
[18:42:09] <taplar> think i knocked out my last two bullet points, whoo hoo
[18:44:07] <robertmaxrees> noice
[20:53:48] <bjsnider> if you are returning an object with two columns per row, and you want to do the same thing with the other item, how would you do it given this example? https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#multiple-remote
[20:54:09] <bjsnider> that example assumes one object per row
[20:54:13] <bjsnider> and one input field
[20:54:41] <robertmaxrees> gotta be able to tie the return objects back to the inputs somehow.
[20:54:55] <bjsnider> yeah, one is already tied in that example
[20:55:12] <robertmaxrees> the data format in that example wouldn't be sufficient.
[20:55:35] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to change it.
[20:56:05] <robertmaxrees> though I'm confused about why you have autocomplete filling multiple inputs in one call.
[20:56:37] <bjsnider> in my view it's the example that's incomplete
[20:56:41] <bjsnider> what would you use that for?
[20:56:46] <robertmaxrees> a single input.
[20:56:52] <bjsnider> to do what?
[20:57:00] <robertmaxrees> autofill based on user input.
[20:57:01] <bjsnider> you're making a list why?
[20:57:09] <robertmaxrees> not terribly uncommon.
[20:57:16] <robertmaxrees> intead of some kind of multiselect.
[20:57:17] <bjsnider> but what are you using the resulting user input for?
[20:57:23] <robertmaxrees> whatever you need.
[20:57:33] <robertmaxrees> could be tagging based on predefined tags on the backend.
[20:57:57] <bjsnider> ok, well, what i think you're doing is posting it and either inserting new rows or updating existing ones
[20:58:10] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:58:12] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[20:58:20] <bjsnider> if you're not using a db in this then i'm not sure what good that input field is
[20:58:30] <robertmaxrees> nobody saiud you can't use this with a db.
[20:58:35] <robertmaxrees> maybe you want to validate or limit the input.
[20:58:41] <robertmaxrees> that's what this handles.
[20:59:10] <robertmaxrees> not an uncommon thing at all.
[20:59:13] <bjsnider> if you're tagging one post multiple times you certainly mist be using 3 tables, one for the posts, one for the tags and one for the posts_tags
[20:59:18] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:59:28] <bjsnider> otherwise you must only allow one tag per post
[20:59:29] <robertmaxrees> the tags could be in a separate table.
[20:59:35] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[20:59:47] <bjsnider> now how do you identify the tags? you have your serial column
[20:59:49] <robertmaxrees> your posts table could have a column for tags.
[20:59:58] <robertmaxrees> and could accept multiple tags
[21:00:02] <bjsnider> thus, you need thos id numbers
[21:00:07] <robertmaxrees> right, separate table of tagnames.
[21:00:20] <robertmaxrees> with an ID and Name for each.
[21:00:20] <bjsnider> the name is just something friendly for the user, but you have to get and post the ids
[21:00:26] <robertmaxrees> ... right?
[21:00:40] <robertmaxrees> hence my entire point.
[21:00:54] <bjsnider> but that example makes no mention of ids, only bird names
[21:01:01] <robertmaxrees> because it's a simplified example.
[21:01:08] <bjsnider> and therefore it's basically not good for anything
[21:01:10] <robertmaxrees> hard to make a usecase that satisfies everybody's taste.
[21:01:18] <robertmaxrees> it's good to illustrate how to use the widget.
[21:01:28] <robertmaxrees> how you back that up with your server is up to you.
[21:01:39] <bjsnider> well, the example above it already deals with multiple in a simple way
[21:02:06] <robertmaxrees> multiple tags?
[21:02:20] <bjsnider> it's the same example minus the remote sourcing
[21:02:26] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[21:02:36] <robertmaxrees> they're just basic examples.
[21:02:37] <bjsnider> it assumes a local array is supplied
[21:02:48] <robertmaxrees> and the remote shows you how to not use a local array...
[21:03:08] <robertmaxrees> your server could return anything and you could handle that however you'd like...
[21:04:04] <bjsnider> well, in my case, and i think most people's cases, the "response" will be a json object with labels and values
[21:04:19] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange way to return that data. but ok.
[21:04:32] <bjsnider> why is it strange?
[21:04:44] <robertmaxrees> because traditionally you'd represent a collection of search results as an array.
[21:05:15] <robertmaxrees> though you could easily adapt these examples to use your object.
[21:05:18] <robertmaxrees> it's just an example.
[21:05:24] <robertmaxrees> it leaves the implementation details up to you.
[21:06:01] <bjsnider> yes, to php it's an associative array, which i build up and then json_encode
[21:06:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd have it pump out a javascript array to make life easier (shrug)
[21:06:58] <bjsnider> a javascript array with names and id numbers?
[21:07:05] <robertmaxrees> aye
[21:07:08] <bjsnider> associated with each other somehow?
[21:07:13] <robertmaxrees> no.
[21:07:17] <robertmaxrees> not an associative array.
[21:07:19] <robertmaxrees> an array.
[21:07:35] <robertmaxrees> javascripts objects are kind of like associative arrays but order isn't necessarily guaranteed.
[21:08:22] <bjsnider> if the two aren't associated then you must be using some kind of match or something to matcht he name to the id
[21:08:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[21:08:45] <robertmaxrees> no, an array of objects.
[21:08:50] <bjsnider> i meant some kind of math\
[21:09:22] <bjsnider> as in the odd keys are the namkes and the even keys are the ids or whatever
[21:09:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[21:09:31] <robertmaxrees> array of objects is what i'm talking about.
[21:09:46] <robertmaxrees> though i don't see how the ID is helpful, maybe you're using it in some way.
[21:10:03] <bjsnider> it's helpful in the database, right?
[21:10:17] <robertmaxrees> how are you going to use that with the autocomplete widget?
[21:10:42] <jak2000> hi all
[21:10:47] <robertmaxrees> sup jak2000
[21:10:53] <jak2000> exist a way that user press a button and clear the cache?
[21:11:03] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 the browser cache?
[21:11:22] <bjsnider> the autocomplete widget builds up the ids into an input, which is then posted and i can explode it and use it in a db transaction
[21:11:45] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider then yeah, array of objects with Id and name properties.
[21:12:29] <bjsnider> by array of objects you're taling about [{name: name, value: value}, {repeat x number of times}]
[21:12:35] <robertmaxrees> si
[21:12:51] <jak2000> yes
[21:12:55] <jak2000> browser cache
[21:13:00] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 back up - why?
[21:13:59] <bjsnider> well, maybe that would be better, maybe not, but i'm not having trouble with the object, just trying to figure out how to properly fill up the id input field
[21:15:32] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[21:15:49] <robertmaxrees> along with http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select
[21:16:33] <jak2000> no.... no backup
[21:16:35] <jak2000> erase all cache
[21:16:45] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 then no.
[21:16:46] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that.
[21:16:58] <robertmaxrees> i was saying back up because i was trying to understand what you actually wanted.
[21:17:04] <bjsnider> that's what i'm already building
[21:17:05] <robertmaxrees> since erasing all of the browser cache is a really bad idea.
[21:18:06] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider fwiw: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4815330/jquery-ui-autocomplete-with-item-and-id
[21:18:21] <robertmaxrees> lots of SO questions with answers ont he subject.
[21:18:46] <robertmaxrees> fa
[21:18:52] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window.
[21:33:24] <jak2000> some users not understand how to erase the cache :)
[21:54:48] <Alturic> Hey guys, I have a form that has a field inputs and selects disabled by default, and if another input's value is 1, it removes the disabled state and allows for user-input to occur. It works as expected, however I do indeed need to submit the disabled input and selects (primarily a 0 for no) so what I'm doing is what feels like a hack-ish approach and that's removing the disabled state on form
[21:54:48] <Alturic> submission in order to get those fields to submit. The problem I'm running into, is that form.find(':disabled').prop('disabled', false).val(1) works swell (as in it sets the val's to "1"), but form1.find(':disabled').prop('disabled', false).val(0) seems to set the val to null?
[21:55:20] <Alturic> Just because of the hack-ish feel to it, I'm unsure if that's even the proper approach to take in order to get these disabled inputs and selects to actually submit a 0 value...
[21:57:49] <Alturic> Ahh, I think I see the issue, it sets 0 to the inputs fine, but since 0 isn't an option in the select that's where it's null'ing it.
[21:57:50] <Alturic> Hmm,
[23:46:35] <Rockwood>  $('#records').on('submit', 'table tr td button.fabc', function () {  is it possible ?
