[07:25:34] <lissitzki> hi
[07:25:48] <lissitzki> studying this function: https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/LgmwfzLx/87/
[07:26:16] <lissitzki> it's not working, I suppose is the selector
[07:26:24] <lissitzki> but no changes made it work
[07:27:35] <Woet> you're STILL working on this?
[07:39:41] <lissitzki> Woet, can you suggest me how to block you :DDD
[07:39:44] <lissitzki> ?
[07:40:28] <lissitzki> Ah ok I found it
[07:41:02] <lissitzki> anyway if you are willing to help, you are welcome
[07:41:31] <Woet> lissitzki: I mean, you've been working on a menu for 2 months and 10 days
[07:41:44] <lissitzki> this is not the answer to my question
[07:42:04] <Woet> lissitzki: how much do you value your time?
[07:42:17] <Woet> even if it's $1 per hour it'd still be cheaper to hire someone
[07:43:11] <lissitzki> thank you, appreciated
[07:43:19] <lissitzki> now
[07:43:30] <lissitzki> value your time as well dude
[08:30:55] <jimmy2> hello - how can i read the value of a named cookie?
[08:32:14] <Cork> jimmy2: you would have to read document.cookie
[08:32:18] <Cork> and then split the string
[08:32:34] <Cork> jimmy2: alternatively you can include the plugin for cookie management
[08:32:55] <Cork> jimmy2: https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie
[08:33:09] <jimmy2> ok - thanks Cork
[08:33:15] <jimmy2> I dont want to use a plugin though
[08:33:40] <Cork> ya, then you have to do document.cookie.split(';') if i remember correctly
[08:33:48] <Cork> and then split each string on =
[08:34:18] <Cork> cause the native dom api for cookies is one long string
[08:35:28] <jimmy2> thanks again Cork
[08:35:42] <Cork> np
[09:28:23] <snowman> lissitzki: try this if you are still here - https://jsfiddle.net/LgmwfzLx/108/
[09:37:18] <snowman> or even better: https://jsfiddle.net/LgmwfzLx/113/
[09:39:40] <grapheti> https://jsfiddle.net/LgmwfzLx/115/

[10:37:55] <hypertiger> https://jsfiddle.net/3L3k12h6/1/
[10:38:21] <hypertiger> it seems like jquery can not find my id. I don't know what did I miss?
[10:42:01] <Cork> hypertiger: no point in having 'form #js-company-info-update-form' ids are page unique (they must be)
[10:42:07] <Cork> so '#js-company-info-update-form' is enough
[10:42:27] <hypertiger> Cork: yea I try that first. but it doesn't recall.
[10:44:24] <Cork> hypertiger: line 27 works just fine https://jsfiddle.net/3L3k12h6/3/
[10:44:25] <hypertiger> Cork: it should recall json string and display on page instead it jump to that page like this https://prnt.sc/ihs07e
[10:44:31] <Cork> so the problem is something else
[10:46:16] <hypertiger> Cork: I set break point at #js-company-info-update-form. but it doesn't stop. mean that code doesn't reach there.
[10:46:56] <hypertiger> I mean at     $('#js-company-info-update-form').ajaxForm({
[10:48:07] <Cork> hypertiger: check your console and check for errors
[10:49:08] <hypertiger> Cork: well I can't. page changed to update page so all console log erased.
[10:49:24] <Cork> hypertiger: enable permanent logs
[10:53:51] <hypertiger> Cork: yea. as I expected.     $('#js-company-info-update-form').ajaxForm() is never called.
[10:54:39] <hypertiger> so strange...
[10:56:27] <Cork> hypertiger: not really strange, 1. the page is reloading so javascript stops, 2. the code it is inside is an event or something and that never runs
[10:56:32] <Cork> or 3. you have an exception
[10:58:16] <hypertiger> https://github.com/tigers2020/R-J-Billing-System/blob/master/static_cdn/js/custom/companyinfo.js
[10:58:20] <hypertiger> this is my javascript
[10:59:01] <hypertiger> https://github.com/tigers2020/R-J-Billing-System/blob/master/templates/account/includes/partial_company_info_update.html
[10:59:10] <hypertiger> and this is my form.
[11:01:23] <Cork> hypertiger: if you add console.log($('#js-company-info-update-form').length) before the .ajaxForm call
[11:01:27] <Cork> what do you get in the console?
[11:02:17] <hypertiger> 0
[11:03:28] <hypertiger> hm...
[11:11:28] <Cork> hypertiger: so you're running the selector before the element exists in the page
[11:16:13] <hypertiger> Cork: so, I move the ajax script to there form loading page and it work!. but I know this is not the best idea doing it.
[11:16:30] <hypertiger> under the form loading page*
[11:47:52] <catuca> We have a window.open("url") on a js file that loads a URL. When that URL is loaded, it reads another JS file that has an AJAX. The code under window.open should NOT execute until the AJAX call is done. How can I do that?
[13:38:36] <nabil>  .serialize can be used with getJSON ?
[13:39:03] <nabil> or does it have to be post
[13:39:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:39:57] <robertmaxrees> serialize is for forms.
[13:44:09] <robertmaxrees> nabil what are you trying to do?
[13:44:44] <nabil> yes, use serialize with a form like this
[13:45:16] <nabil> (just a min)
[13:46:11] <nabil> $.getJSON($SCRIPT_ROOT + '/_add_numbers', $('form#myForm').serialize(), function(data) {
[13:46:11] <nabil>  // do something here
[13:46:11] <nabil>       });
[13:46:15] <nabil> like this
[13:46:42] <nabil> this should pass all input fields inside the form right?
[13:47:08] <nabil> _add_nummbers is just a python functino
[13:53:52] <robertmaxrees> ah, that should work.  could always try it and find out.
[16:47:31] <gambl0re> how do i serialize my form?
[16:48:16] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ or http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[16:48:44] <gambl0re> its not working
[16:49:02] <robertmaxrees> define "not working"?
[16:49:06] <gambl0re> i $('form').serialize() and it does nothing
[16:49:19] <robertmaxrees> how are you using it?
[16:49:22] * robertmaxrees slaps Archelaus around a bit with a large trout
[16:49:28] <robertmaxrees> woops hahaha
[16:49:31] <robertmaxrees> sorry misclick.
[16:49:45] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, are you saving it to a var or something?
[16:50:10] <gambl0re> im doing console.log($('form').serialize() and it returns nothing
[16:50:19] <gambl0re> i want to see the values of my input fields
[16:50:25] <gambl0re> thats being submitted
[16:50:29] <robertmaxrees> do your inputs have names?
[16:51:31] <gambl0re> ya
[16:51:41] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[16:58:41] <gambl0re> negative. still not working
[16:59:14] <robertmaxrees> show me the fiddle.
[16:59:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:03:36] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re don't pm me lol
[17:03:40] <robertmaxrees> show me the fiddle.
[17:04:36] <gambl0re> SORRY!
[17:05:29] <robertmaxrees> it'd be suuuuper easy to help if you just showed me your fiddle.
[17:05:55] <Archelaus> lol
[17:06:25] * robertmaxrees shrugs
[17:06:31] <robertmaxrees> dunno why people are so weird about stuff like this.
[17:08:58] <gambl0re> here
[17:08:58] <gambl0re> https://codepen.io/pen/?editors=1111
[17:09:19] <robertmaxrees> gotta click "save" buddy
[17:09:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:09:36] <robertmaxrees> blank pen otherwise.
[17:14:21] <robertmaxrees> welp
[17:18:01] <gambl0re> i dont know what to do. thanks anyways
[17:18:10] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:18:13] <robertmaxrees> you need to save the pen.
[17:18:40] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/FylafZe.png
[17:19:07] <robertmaxrees> like, you put the js in the relevant area, click that button, then share the link.
[17:19:10] <robertmaxrees> not that hard.
[17:22:38] <gambl0re> ok. i thought i did that not i lost everything.
[17:22:44] <gambl0re> *now
[17:22:49] <gambl0re> anyways THANKS!
[17:22:54] <robertmaxrees> uh. k.
[17:27:20] <cannap> guys i know this is not a jquery problem but is this a good way to change array in object https://jsfiddle.net/4643hLb6/18/
[17:27:34] <cannap> or should i make it immutable? xD
[17:28:01] <cannap> hi :D
[17:28:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:28:16] <robertmaxrees> what are you asking?
[17:28:58] <robertmaxrees> why are you declaring the object and then immediately transforming it??
[17:30:20] <cannap> as example
[17:30:29] <cannap> because i never know whats in the icon later :D
[17:30:51] <cannap> because i use the new fontAwesome for node and now i pass the icon as string and then i load it from nodejs and replace it with the svg code
[17:31:04] <cannap> and i dont want to include the whole fontAwesome lib in my frontend
[17:31:11] <cannap> because i never know which icon i want to use
[17:57:16] <cannap> @robertmaxrees, https://gist.github.com/cannap/1dc2a2366774b87702895a0ea83848f3 thats the goal and it works
[17:58:07] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:58:20] <robertmaxrees> why don't you fix the /services endpoing to do what you want in the first place?
[17:59:16] <cannap> because its dynamic
[17:59:22] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:59:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:59:29] <cannap> and i just have json files
[17:59:34] <cannap> its just a small portfolio site
[17:59:35] <cannap> :D
[17:59:46] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:59:47] <robertmaxrees> 'kay?
[18:00:21] <cannap> thats the input https://paste.laravel.io/818c13c5-90a7-4955-b7dd-2c6fbe5daa9a
[18:00:39] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:00:40] <cannap> i dont code that stuff hard because i need to rebuild the js files everytime i use vue with nuxt
[18:00:41] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:02:58] <Sveta> trying to replicate a small test case for anoter things i'm doing. http://jsbin.com/gizarucoti/edit?html,js,console  -- here it doesn't log 'got data', why is that?
[18:06:37] <Sveta> actually i've got that fixed. it was cross domain. so i put 'null.jsbin.com' into the url.
[18:06:53] <Sveta> the real problem now: the function returns 'undefined'. but it should return the data.
[18:07:31] <cannap>  No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource
[18:08:20] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:08:42] <robertmaxrees> no CORS Sveta
[18:08:48] <Sveta> like i said, that's already fixed, except i am struggling with finding a 'save' button on the paste
[18:08:58] <Sveta> it's reverting my last edit :(
[18:09:15] <robertmaxrees> this is why id on't liek jsbin heh
[18:09:21] <robertmaxrees> how did you "fix" that?
[18:09:30] <robertmaxrees> also
[18:09:35] <robertmaxrees> you can't return data out of ajax calls.
[18:09:37] <Sveta> i put `var url ='//null.jsbin.com';`
[18:09:53] <Sveta> what do i do if i want to get date from an ajax call?
[18:09:56] <Sveta> data
[18:10:07] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on the data needs to be in the callback.
[18:10:29] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you can return the ajax call promise and use .then() against that.
[18:10:29] <Sveta> what if i've got three queries each of whose urls depends on the data obtained in the previous query?
[18:10:37] <Sveta> ok
[18:10:44] <Sveta> thanks robertmaxrees
[18:10:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/v619h6s6/2/
[18:11:02] <robertmaxrees> like that.
[18:12:03] <cannap> @Sveta, https://jsfiddle.net/sbbafxjj/3/
[18:12:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:12:27] <robertmaxrees> almost literally did the same thing ;)
[18:12:41] <cannap> i catch them all :P
[18:12:53] <robertmaxrees> *techically* you don't.
[18:13:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/sbbafxjj/4/ would though./
[18:13:51] <cannap> done is called always or? but it dont gives error?
[18:14:01] <cannap> i have no idea i use await async try catch its 2018 :P
[18:14:09] <robertmaxrees> .done() is basically a shorthand for .then(function, null);
[18:14:21] <cannap> ah and always something like finally ?
[18:14:37] <cannap> as example i have load and in .always success or error i clear the loader
[18:14:44] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.always/
[18:16:27] <cannap> ah yes
[18:16:35] <cannap> i forgot almost everything about jquery xD
[18:16:46] <cannap> but time comes again when i need to code some woocommerce shop^^
[18:44:49] <cthulchu> hey guys, is there a way to get the http code of a page onpageload? Shouldn't it store the code somewhere in the document object?
[18:45:45] <robertmaxrees> "http code"?
[18:45:52] <robertmaxrees> like, the status code?
[18:47:34] <robertmaxrees> cthulchu
[18:47:47] <cthulchu> yes
[18:47:51] <cthulchu> the one that's usually 200
[18:48:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the status code :)
[18:48:06] <cthulchu> I wanna catch all 4xx and 5xx codes and send them to GA
[18:48:23] <cthulchu> not relying on third parties
[18:48:26] <robertmaxrees> sadly enough, you can't.
[18:48:31] <robertmaxrees> can't access that information via js.
[18:48:52] <robertmaxrees> you CAN create a 4xx handler on your server that sets a flag for that, however.
[18:48:59] <cthulchu> that's disappointing. Weird that it wouldn't be a part of the object
[18:49:10] <cthulchu> nah, there are easier ways
[18:49:14] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:49:21] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't you just set that on your server?
[18:49:27] <cthulchu> like change custom error pages
[18:49:35] <cthulchu> adding the identifier to them
[18:49:44] <cthulchu> and then parse the identifier out of them
[18:49:52] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[18:49:59] <robertmaxrees> that's what i literally just suggested.
[18:50:02] <cthulchu> the "error handler" IS the response code
[18:50:12] <cthulchu> ah, well, ok
[18:50:50] <cthulchu> but that's sad. JS has to be able to access headers, not just body
[18:51:00] <cthulchu> can't believe browsers don't supply access to headers
[18:51:06] <cthulchu> it's so obvious
[18:52:50] <cthulchu> I think it's JS engine issue
[18:53:04] <cthulchu> the v8
[18:54:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:54:24] <robertmaxrees> security issue.
[19:00:27] <cthulchu> how so?
[19:00:44] <cthulchu> why would making headers accessible create a security issue?
[19:01:36] <cthulchu> we still can get headers if we're able to encapsulate the request whether listening on top of an iframe or listening to ajax
[19:01:47] <cthulchu> just not on the normal pageload
[19:04:01] <Sveta> how do i sort {'e':'f',a:'b',c:'d'} to become {a:'b',c:'d', 'e':'f'} ?
[19:18:22] <pavonia> Sveta: These are the same objects
[19:18:26] <Sveta> ok
[19:42:35] <Guest6064> ?
[19:42:42] <Guest6064> use undersort
[19:42:55] <Guest6064> or better yet
[19:42:58] <Guest6064> use lodash
[19:43:15] <Guest6064> _.sort()
[20:06:19] <nabil_> robertmaxrees
[20:06:36] <nabil_> I tried to bind form's submit to my function
[20:07:04] <nabil_> but it keeps getting the data of the first form, no matter the submit I click
