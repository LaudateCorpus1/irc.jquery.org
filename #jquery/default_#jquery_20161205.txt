[05:00:47] <goutam> hi iam new i want to  participate  in gsoc 2017 with jquery how can i start?please help me
[06:48:22] <snfgf> guys
[06:48:48] <snfgf> $.ajax(url, { ... }), or $.ajax({ url: ..., })
[06:48:50] <snfgf> O_O
[06:55:04] <hellyeah> is it false to do that? $(this).attr('disabled', true);
[07:08:59] <v4ult> My browsers hang and report that my jQuery script is unresponsive  whenever I submit a signup form.  I'm not sure if the issue is with my jQuery script of the version of jQuery that I have loaded.  How can I correct this?  HTML: http://pastebin.com/gSQTUvpr  jQuery: http://pastebin.com/z6WKUcsq
[07:43:19] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[07:54:11] <hellyeah> i am using jquery ui datepicker i want to get onedaynext what did i do wrong here
[07:54:12] <hellyeah> oneDayNext.setDate($(this).closest('.datePicker').find('.to').datepicker("getDate") + 1);
[07:56:05] <v4ult> hellyeah do you have a gist link of the code?
[07:56:33] <hellyeah> yeah but it is kinda long code
[07:56:39] <hellyeah> i have jsfiddle
[07:57:00] <v4ult> That should work
[07:57:20] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/smzz2vvk/5/ line 577-589
[07:57:42] <hellyeah> just create datepicker with plus select dates and click pencil button
[07:57:54] <hellyeah> that triggers function in line 577-589
[07:58:16] <hellyeah> i just want to get next date of my selection made it "to"
[07:58:23] <hellyeah> second datepicker
[07:58:40] <hellyeah> if you refuse to look because code is long it is totally understandable
[08:00:25] <Dulcin> Hi, I'm a bit confused, I wrote some JavaScript/jQuery code to prevent my forms from submitting twice if someone double clicks. But somehow it seems to remove the name of the submit button from the post when I add it to my html. This is the code: http://pastebin.com/YhD6SfFJ
[08:01:17] <Dulcin> Say I have a submit button <button type="submit" name="show">Submit</button> then without that javascript I would see the "show" in the POST, with that javascript it is not there anymore
[08:02:03] <m1su> disabled input elements are not submitted
[08:02:30] <Dulcin> Ahh that makes sense
[08:02:57] <Dulcin> So would I be able to add it to the post in the JS submit anyway?
[08:05:37] <hellyeah> any concern?
[08:05:52] <hellyeah> any tips?
[08:09:06] <mar77i> hmm, I'm trying to return a value from sel.change(function() { return x; }) where does x end up?
[08:10:05] <v4ult> hellyeah did you use a plugin to create your calender? I'm trying to understand why some elements are hidden
[08:10:34] <hellyeah> i used jquery ui datepicker and jqxwidget calendar
[08:10:50] <hellyeah> i guess i figure out the solution
[08:12:16] <hellyeah> v4ult:  $(this).closest('.datePicker').find('.to').datepicker("getDate").getDate() + 1
[08:12:39] <hellyeah> you actually create datepickers "from" and "to" one by one with + button
[08:13:20] <hellyeah> anyway i figured that out that probleöm
[08:13:54] <hellyeah> now what i wonder is, is there a method like count in jquery for calculating how many element in dom with same class?
[08:14:08] <hellyeah> hope my question is understandable
[08:44:48] <mar77i> uh ajax validated form.
[08:48:05] <mar77i> so I figured out that one could press the submit button before the form has properly ajaxed. now I added two flags "submit_form" on the input field that would cause the form to be always(submit)'ted, abort the submit before the asynchronous part has been dealt with, and lastChange, to check what the input's value after the last validation was.
[08:48:51] <mar77i> "by properly ajaxed" I mean something happens asynchronously in a .change() event
[08:52:44] <mar77i> I'll try to show you: var inp = $("input[name=importantinput]"); inp[0].submitForm = false; inp[0].lastChange = inp[0].value; inp.change(function() { $.post({...}, function() {}).always(function() { if(inp[0].submitForm) $("form").submit(); }) }); $("form").submit(function() { if(inp[0].lastChange == inp[0].value) { return true; } else { inp[0].submitForm = true; inp.change(); } })
[08:53:29] <mar77i> ...and a return false after calling inp.change() there at the end.
[09:00:39] <mar77i> I'm sure there's a better way.
[10:03:06] <v4ult> My browsers hang and report an unresponsive jQuery script error whenever I submit a signup form.  I think it is to do with the submit handler within the jQuery validator plugin. https://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/   How can I correct this?

[11:41:58] <truckcrash> Hello, I have a small script that should fire when the users cursor leaves from the window frame that displays the webpage.
[11:42:03] <truckcrash> I am using $("body").mouseout(function() { /*...*/ } to detect this, but it is triggering every time my mouse moves over a different element such a as a div on the page.
[11:42:06] <truckcrash> Is there a way to make this so that it will only trigger when the moust leaves the outter bounds of the webpage?
[11:50:04] <truckcrash> Ah, sorted. mouseleave is what I needed. not mouseout
[12:09:44] <robertmaxrees> oh that's right you're avoiding using data attributes for some reason.
[12:09:48] <plamb_> :(
[12:09:57] <plamb_> i was hoping you wouldnt remember
[12:10:01] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:10:12] <robertmaxrees> just seems weird.
[12:20:21] <plamb_> how would you write a .substring where the second param is just "the end of the string"
[12:20:28] <plamb_> i.e. s.substring(7, "end of string")
[12:20:41] <plamb_> s.length ?
[12:21:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:21:39] <robertmaxrees> no need to pass the second arg iirc.
[12:38:25] <dan_j> Hi. If I want to add my own properties like this, how do I access them using jquery? <div id="something" myproperty="some data">
[12:38:29] <pippuccio76> Hi
[12:38:58] <robertmaxrees> dan_j you technically can't define your own attributes.
[12:39:09] <robertmaxrees> that's why data attributes exist.
[12:39:11] <pippuccio76> I have a problem with a plugin blueimp ,
[12:39:47] <dan_j> robertmaxrees: ah. they appear in the browser development tools so i thought it would be possible. plus i've seen javascript libraries using them. such as chart libraries etc.
[12:40:50] <robertmaxrees> dan_j yeah, technically you aren't supposed to do that.
[12:41:02] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are really what you want.
[12:41:07] <dan_j> I'll give data attributes a go. Thanks!
[12:41:11] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:41:16] <robertmaxrees> you can access/set them with .data()
[12:41:21] <robertmaxrees> check out the api docs for more.
[12:41:30] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 if you have a question go ahead and ask.
[12:41:39] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[12:46:18] <pippuccio76> i want to limit the sum of filesize upload with the plugin blueimp
[12:46:42] <robertmaxrees> ok
[12:46:46] <robertmaxrees> so what have you tried?
[12:47:03] <pippuccio76> the limitMultiFileUploadSize
[12:47:05] <pippuccio76> dont go
[12:47:15] <robertmaxrees> show us what you tried :)
[12:47:51] <pippuccio76> <script>$('#fileupload').fileupload({        'option',    {        limitMultiFileUploadSize: 5000000 //5Mb,        sequentialUploads: true
[12:47:51] <pippuccio76>     } </script>
[12:47:57] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:48:26] <robertmaxrees> so when you say "dont go", what do you mean?
[12:48:49] <pippuccio76> i must upload more than 5 mb
[12:49:20] <robertmaxrees> you mean it doesn't stop you from doing that?
[12:49:20] <pippuccio76> without errors
[12:49:29] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid code btw.
[12:49:29] <pippuccio76> yes
[12:49:41] <robertmaxrees> can you share your js via bpaste or something similar?
[12:50:26] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/j8ptmbyk/
[12:50:38] <pippuccio76> this is only a option
[12:50:55] <robertmaxrees> that's valid code - what you had before wasn'ty.
[12:51:32] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure your file is over 5 mb?
[12:51:52] <robertmaxrees> what if you set the site to an incredibly small number, like 1 - does it work then?
[12:52:11] <pippuccio76> yes , more file dont go....
[12:52:32] <pippuccio76> than i wwrite my own code (modify the original code ...wait
[12:52:34] <robertmaxrees> so then the issue may be that the file isn't big enough.
[12:53:04] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/skhvgodL/
[12:53:15] <robertmaxrees> woah
[12:53:31] <robertmaxrees> where's the JS?
[12:54:55] <pippuccio76> in this way i try to disable start button , js its between {% %} tag
[12:55:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:55:15] <pippuccio76> http://lemuria.altervista.org/Prova/
[12:55:18] <robertmaxrees> this is some kind of templating engine.
[12:55:21] <pippuccio76> see this
[12:55:28] <robertmaxrees> i know the plugin.
[12:55:37] <robertmaxrees> you're linking to some kind of templating code.
[12:55:43] <robertmaxrees> the js doesn't know about that.
[12:55:47] <robertmaxrees> it sees html.
[12:56:20] <pippuccio76> but in the link if u try to upload more than 1mb an allert appear
[12:56:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:56:31] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:56:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have bad html/js
[12:56:55] <MassDebates> Just got in
[12:57:02] <MassDebates> I see <script> tags in the js pane on a fiddle.
[12:57:09] <MassDebates> I must be in the right place.
[12:57:10] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates yeah we're covering that heh
[12:57:15] <MassDebates> How's it going all?
[12:57:31] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:57:35] <pippuccio76> this code is cdownloaded by plugin
[12:57:57] <MassDebates> altervista is blocked for me so I cant see what's there.
[12:58:43] <MassDebates> upload size validation isn't that tough, though.
[12:59:30] <MassDebates> Have you consulted https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/ ?
[12:59:46] <MassDebates> If you need legacies, though, i don't think that'll work.
[13:00:02] <MassDebates> maybe something flash-based? I know you used to be able to control uploads a bit more with that.
[13:00:08] <MassDebates> You'd essentially put the stop at the UI with the flash
[13:01:34] <pippuccio76> im searching some to block them im not very able with js  im a php programmer
[13:01:55] <MassDebates> just to recap. altervista is blocked for me so I cant see what's there. upload size validation isn't that tough, though. Have you consulted https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/ ? If you need legacies, though, i don't think that'll work. maybe something flash-based? I know you used to be able to control uploads a bit more with that.  You'd essentially put
[13:01:55] <MassDebates>  the stop at the UI with the flash
[13:02:48] <MassDebates> The given example is a bit more robust than necessary for learning how it works, though.
[13:03:15] <pippuccio76> where can i put this code to show you?
[13:03:37] <pippuccio76> in the doc ther is:
[13:03:40] <pippuccio76> imitMultiFileUploadsTo limit the number of files uploaded with one XHR request, set the following option to an integer greater than 0:Type: integerDefault: undefinedExample: 3Note: This option is ignored, if singleFileUploads is set to true or limitMultiFileUploadSize is set and the browser reports file sizes.
[13:05:15] <MassDebates> What templating engine are you using?
[13:06:10] <pippuccio76> i dont know , i download the plugin from github , this is ui version
[13:06:16] <MassDebates> looks like KO, are you using KOjs?
[13:06:30] <MassDebates> perhaps providing the github url?
[13:06:42] <MassDebates> perhaps provide the github url?
[13:06:57] <pippuccio76> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/archive/master.zip
[13:07:31] <MassDebates> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/archive/
[13:07:45] <MassDebates> woops. This, right? https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[13:07:56] <pippuccio76> yes
[13:08:51] <MassDebates> Have you gotten anything to work at all so far? Are you familiar with jquery? this doesn't seem difficult to implement, either.
[13:09:27] <MassDebates> I assume you're also using this? https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates
[13:09:52] <MassDebates> To solve your templating issues, I would suggest pushing dry-runs through this to see what goes kaflooey with the build. https://blueimp.github.io/JavaScript-Templates/
[13:10:06] <MassDebates> That will do a live render to show you the results quickly for testing.
[13:10:23] <MassDebates> As for your uploading widget, Try making another jsfiddle or a codepen with a complete and verifiable example
[13:10:44] <MassDebates> I would suggest following the minimalist guide, which can be found here: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin
[13:11:08] <MassDebates> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Setup This will be a good production code guide for you to follow after you make yourself a sample.
[13:13:10] <pippuccio76> see this :
[13:13:13] <pippuccio76> http://jsbin.com/semuzipita/edit?html,output
[13:13:20] <pippuccio76> this is source
[13:27:15] <codecutter> how would get the substringd 'term=foo' and 'page=0' from string '/secure/search/all?term=foo?&page=0 term=0'
[13:48:21] <MikeD_> are you sure that second ? is real?
[14:20:02] <plamb__> i know this is a javascript question, but if i want to drop the first 3 elements of an array
[14:20:08] <plamb__> is there a better way than calling shift() 3 times
[14:20:13] <MassDebates> let them go.
[14:20:16] <MassDebates> They'll fall right to the ground.
[14:21:24] <plamb__> robertmaxrees where r u
[14:21:51] <MassDebates> I think he's offline. In all seriousness, have you considered managing a loop with it or using splice?
[14:22:19] <plamb__> splice returns the deleted elements which baffles me
[14:22:25] <MassDebates> Yes
[14:22:51] <plamb__> most languages i've used have a .drop method or something like it
[14:23:42] <MassDebates> Well .drop is more about like
[14:23:42] <MassDebates> when it's done
[14:23:43] <MassDebates> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/drop
[14:24:08] <MassDebates> Y'know, draggables n whatnot
[14:24:34] <plamb__> im not sure when i'd want to delete items from an array and have them back
[14:25:09] <MassDebates> #jquery is awful dead right now. Maybe ##javascript will be of use to you.
[14:25:34] <MassDebates> You can always dismiss, too. I would check in that room for more information
[14:27:14] <MassDebates> plamb_:  Do you have a more developed question to ask? What's wrong with splice?
[14:27:21] <MassDebates> Is it only because of the return given?
[14:27:59] <MassDebates> You can do other stuff too. I need more information to give you a good direction.
[14:28:13] <MassDebates> Are you trying to come up with a filter of sorts? Because there's that, too.
[14:38:33] <catbadger> ok. so I need to catch the time during a window resize, before the resize event is fired, while a user is resizing the window. does jquery allow for this?
[14:38:39] <catbadger> i can't figure it out
[14:38:41] <catbadger> :/
[14:39:31] <catbadger> it seems as though the resize event is fired after the user releases the resized window
[14:39:59] <catbadger> this causes ui elements to jumble up a moment before our js grabs onto them and resizes them.
[14:40:13] <catbadger> I'd like to hide those items during the drag to resize the window.
[14:41:10] <catbadger> oooooh
[14:41:44] <catbadger> oops
[14:41:48] <catbadger> closing my other tabs
[14:45:49] <catbadger> is anyone 100% sure how/when the resize event is triggered?
[17:00:41] <taplar> so sleepy
[17:39:55] <Hebboh> Hello, trying to find the best/easiest solution, to add an attribute to an html tag when a specific div tag is shown. Can anyone please point me in the correct direction?
[17:40:31] <taplar> what attribute?
[17:40:46] <taplar> a standard attribute or a custom one?
[17:40:47] <Hebboh> 'disabled'
[17:41:02] <taplar> $(elementSelector).prop('disabled', true/false)
[17:42:08] <Hebboh> hmm i'll look in to that taplar thanks
[18:21:06] <Hebboh> Noob question, do i need to declare a function to use an if statement ?
[18:22:37] <taplar> no
[18:22:53] <taplar> not inherently
[18:23:39] <Hebboh> thanks taplar :)
[18:29:49] <ExtraSteve> Sup losers
[20:32:35] <ismithers> Can I access an instance of jQuery Validator after it has been configured?
[22:44:12] <GeekMonkey> Hey
[22:44:17] <GeekMonkey> has anyone used this before
[22:44:18] <GeekMonkey> https://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/43a860bc0024792f8803bba8ca0d5ecd
[22:44:36] <GeekMonkey> I like the look of it... but I want to use the CSV version and need some help
[22:45:06] <GeekMonkey> This is the CSV version
[22:45:07] <GeekMonkey> https://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/1dbf3d4abe0ab53f8c4c6bd24192bb6b
[23:25:25] <solice> GeekMonkey the csv version looks broken in the demo
[23:25:32] <solice> its not collapsing or expanding
[23:39:25] <GeekMonkey> solice... I know
[23:39:35] <GeekMonkey> that is what I am trying to add
[23:44:19] <solice> GeekMonkey if the CSV version is broken i wouldn't use it
[23:55:31] <ismithers> Does anyone know how I can get an event to trigger for jquery validator, when you empty an input? There must be one, because it makes the field as 'valid' with a class. But $.validator.success doesn't trigger, so it must be another.
