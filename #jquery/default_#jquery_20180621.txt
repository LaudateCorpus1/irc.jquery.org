[01:23:53] <user_kevin> jQuery-ui draggable cursor style doesn’t work currectly in Chrome. You can test it by opening this url https://jqueryui.com/draggable/#cursor-style in your chrome browser
[01:24:51] <user_kevin> the first element doesn’t show a move cursor in chrome windows
[01:27:13] <user_kevin> and the second element should have a crosshair cursor
[01:28:08] <user_kevin> Anyone know how to make the draggable work correctly about the cursor style?
[03:24:46] <rocketmagnet> hi everyone
[03:25:56] <rocketmagnet> In my code I'm using <a href="javascript:myfunc();">...</a>, now in the jQuery code, how can i refer to the <a> element ? this is pointing to the Window object :X i just want to add/remove a class to set if the menuelement is selected or not
[03:26:28] <Cork> rocketmagnet: don't, give the element an id or a class and use modern event handling
[03:26:45] <rocketmagnet> what would that for example ?
[03:27:03] <rocketmagnet> i'v not used jQuery in a while
[03:27:07] <Cork> <a id="something"></a> in js: $('#something').on('click', myfunc);
[03:27:28] <Cork> and even better, don't abuse links for click actions
[03:27:30] <rocketmagnet> ok, it's also better this way i can hide the js with some obfuscator :)
[03:27:36] <Cork> use <button type="button"></button>
[03:27:43] <Cork> (you can style them with css)
[03:47:14] <thykka> rocketmagnet, why do you think you need to hide it?
[04:03:09] <rocketmagnet> Cork: when using the on('click') handler i have the problem that i gets executed at startup without clicking... does href element must be '#' ?? or doesn't it matter ??
[04:03:27] <Cork> you have () in the function binding
[04:03:55] <Cork> its on('click', myfunction) not on('click', myfunction())
[04:07:01] <rocketmagnet> i've $('#someId').on('click', load_menu('my_menu));
[04:08:04] <rocketmagnet> is that correct ?
[04:08:32] <AdamPDotty> nope
[04:08:50] <AdamPDotty> odd number of quotes is rarely a good sign
[04:08:50] <rocketmagnet> what's wrong with it ?
[04:09:16] <rocketmagnet> oh... i mean load_menu('menu')
[04:09:28] <rocketmagnet> but the rest is correct right ?
[04:09:36] <AdamPDotty> I doubt it.
[04:09:50] <rocketmagnet> hm, what else can i do wrong here ... ?
[04:09:54] <AdamPDotty> on() expects last parameter to ba callable
[04:10:06] <AdamPDotty> does load_menu() return a callable?
[04:10:12] <rocketmagnet> a function is not a callable ?
[04:10:23] <AdamPDotty> a function is callable
[04:10:32] <rocketmagnet> load_menu() is a function
[04:10:33] <AdamPDotty> so does load_menu() return a function ?
[04:10:44] <AdamPDotty> load_menu is a call to a function
[04:10:48] <AdamPDotty> oops
[04:10:59] <AdamPDotty> load_menu() is a call to a function
[04:11:15] <AdamPDotty> I do not know, what it returns
[04:12:26] <rocketmagnet> it returns nothing
[04:12:35] <AdamPDotty> nothing is not a callable
[04:12:38] <rocketmagnet> so the function must return a callable
[04:12:44] <rocketmagnet> i understand
[04:12:48] <AdamPDotty> wellll
[04:13:06] <AdamPDotty> it would be badly named, if it were to return a callable
[04:13:23] <pavonia> What else is a callable beside functions?
[04:14:17] <AdamPDotty> I guess in Javascript you could consider anything callable a function.
[04:15:00] <AdamPDotty> I am not sure in that point, but for now we consider both the same.
[04:15:16] <pavonia> But are there different types of callables?
[04:15:34] <AdamPDotty> a closure is a function, right?
[04:16:41] <AdamPDotty> In PHP you would have an Interface Callable.
[04:16:57] <AdamPDotty> So some objects are callable, others not.
[04:17:10] <AdamPDotty> But not sure that even applies to Javascript.
[04:21:04] <pavonia> Yeah, I'd think both are the same in JS
[04:24:45] <rocketmagnet> Cork: now it's working your way, now how can i'm able to add a class to the a attribute ? this is again pointing to Window
[04:25:07] <rocketmagnet> wasn't this in a click() in the past not the element clicked ?
[04:31:12] <AdamPDotty> Try English?
[04:31:50] <Cork> rocketmagnet: if you want to pass an argument to a function you need to wrap the function in an anonymous function
[04:32:26] <Cork> so on('click', function() { load_menu('menu'); })
[04:32:46] <Cork> as () will execute the function not pass it as a reference
[04:43:42] <rocketmagnet> how to get the reference to the <a> element inside the on('click', function(){  HERE I NEED THIS (a reference to the <a> element) });
[04:44:15] <Cork> rocketmagnet: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[04:45:13] <thykka> rocketmagnet, .on('click', function(event) { var $clickedElement = $(event.target); });
[04:45:47] <thykka> ..that is, if the event handler was bound to the <a>...
[04:45:53] <thykka> if not, you'll need something else
[04:53:28] <Cork> thykka: no you don't want to use event.target you want to use this
[04:53:56] <Cork> else things like <a><span>this won't work</span></a> will bite you
[04:55:54] <thykka> true
[04:56:33] <AdamPDotty> in the kinky way?
[04:56:58] <thykka> event.currentTarget should point to the element to which the handler was attached to
[04:57:16] <thykka> whereas event.target points to the immediate element
[04:59:47] <Cork> ya, in modern jquery you can
[05:00:07] <Cork> older jquery didn't forward currentTarget
[07:51:58] <forgotmynick> hello. i'm debugging an issue and see in the console: "TypeError: jQuery(...).adjust_position is not a function"  -- does anyone know what this is?
[07:52:22] <Cork> forgotmynick: a plugin you haven't loaded most likely
[07:52:38] <forgotmynick> Cork: but what plugin
[07:53:46] <Cork> donno
[07:54:12] <Cork> it uses a none common naming format so most likely not very common
[07:54:15] <Woet> forgotmynick: whatever you use for "adjust_position"
[07:54:16] <Woet> doesnt sound like a plugin function name though
[07:54:30] <Woet> more like someone who extended jQuery for you
[07:54:35] <Cork> true
[07:54:47] <Cork> though that is the same thing
[07:54:49] <Woet> forgotmynick: just search your source code for "adjust_position"
[07:54:56] <Woet> Cork: kinda, i don't consider those plugins
[07:55:03] <Woet> but yea, i get what you mean
[07:55:28] <Cork> so a snippet becomes a plugin when someone publishes in on github or where do you draw the line?
[07:55:37] <forgotmynick> Woet: already did, assumed it was a third party plugin but I'll search from some backups, maybe it was there but was removed
[07:55:53] <Woet> yea, something like that, not sure. my definitions aren't very well established.
[07:56:15] <forgotmynick> yes found it, it was in a backup
[07:56:22] <Cork> a plugin is something that plugsinto jquery
[07:56:28] <Woet> forgotmynick: i hope you mean git history
[07:56:37] <Woet> forgotmynick: cause if you're not using git, its time to start
[07:56:59] <forgotmynick> it's my friends wordpress website
[07:57:08] <Cork> or any other revision manager
[07:57:53] <Woet> Cork: come on, we both know git has no competition
[07:58:01] <Cork> heh
[07:58:23] <Cork> mercurial and git are both quite commonly used
[07:58:40] <Cork> i would question using any other then those right now though
[07:58:55] <Cork> but in some cases it makes sense
[08:03:25] <forgotmynick> git doesn't have competition because they came in early, doesn't necessarily mean they are better
[08:03:44] <Cork> git and mercuril came at the same time
[08:04:14] <forgotmynick> git put a lot more effort into reaching
[08:04:34] <Cork> more like it got advertisement for free cause who wrote it
[10:09:42] <Caspan> Is there a way to take one row of a table and push it right 10px
[10:10:39] <Caspan> so basically as you mouse over it it pops right to show selection kind of
[10:12:23] <Cork> Caspan: you can do something like https://jsfiddle.net/Lzrp3b9c/2/
[10:12:58] <Caspan> ohh that might work
[10:13:01] <Caspan> CSS only
[10:29:27] <Caspan> Cork: that only moved the content inside the row right didnt move the whole row right
[10:31:02] <Caspan> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/Lzrp3b9c/6/
[10:32:03] <Caspan> but it looks like it is if i color the TD not the TR
[10:32:17] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/Lzrp3b9c/7/
[10:32:21] <Caspan> ill try that instead
[10:47:28] <Caspan> Cork: GOt it to work.. perfect.. thanks
[11:49:03] <Toklos> I have a question, if I want to transfer jquery a description of an image passage (like 300 characters), but I don't want it to be viewable by the browser, but I do want google and other crawlers to catch it, what is the best way to store it on the html?
[15:58:53] <sunrunner20> i've got an AJAX request that should return JSON, but if the user idles to long it may return the login page instead, is there a way to handle this?
[16:17:32] <finalbeta> Hi, I'm trying to load part of a page (zabbix map) into part of another page. the page I'm loading has javascripts and url's that are relative to it again. Making it break when I load it from the current url. everything shares the same base url. I'm on domain/test trying to load from domain/something.
[16:18:11] <finalbeta> is there a way to fix all relative paths from the url i'm loading withouth regex replacing things? like setting a base url for what i'm loading.
[16:19:20] <pavonia> sunrunner20: You could send an AJAX ping request to the server regularily, so that it know the user is still "connected"
[16:20:30] <sunrunner20> pavonia unfortunately that'd reset the timer and the users need to be kicked out after half an hour of inactivity
[16:21:19] <pavonia> Yes, that's what I mean, make sure he doesn't get kicked out
[16:21:54] <sunrunner20> its required that he IS
[16:21:58] <sunrunner20> or she
[16:22:28] <pavonia> Not sure what you're asking for then
[16:23:17] <sunrunner20> detect in the AJAX request that it got redirected to login and didn't receive the AJAX expected
[16:23:24] <sunrunner20> *JSON
[16:24:30] <pavonia> Can't you handle that when decoding the JSON?
[16:24:52] <pavonia> Or do you want an extra error case for it?
[16:27:12] <sunrunner20> how can I detect no JSON was returned?
[16:27:26] <robertmaxrees> sunrunner20 you look at the response body in you .then()
[16:27:52] <sunrunner20> not using a .then
[16:28:00] <robertmaxrees> you should be :)
[16:28:04] <sunrunner20> using .ajax with success or failure
[16:28:22] <robertmaxrees> ah, should be using .then().catch() instead, but either way.
[16:28:35] <robertmaxrees> you just check the response body in your success.
[16:29:01] <robertmaxrees> though the server should return a consistent object eitgher way, with an "isLoggedIn" flag.  or sometghing similar.
[16:58:41] <finalbeta> I guess I'll Iframe it. tryied to string replace the response, but that only half worked.
[16:59:39] <robertmaxrees> finalbeta do you have control over the place you're grabbing the markup fropm?
[16:59:41] <robertmaxrees> *from
[17:59:20] <finalbeta> robertmaxrees, I do, but I rather not change the code (zabbix is open source, but keeping it easy to upgrade is a must). I'm using an iframe. It's on an internal wiki for technical documentation. It integrates fine now(even though it's an iframe )
[18:01:20] <Miles8of9> robertmaxrees, are you there?
[18:02:19] <robertmaxrees> along with 330+ other people :)
[18:02:40] <Miles8of9> they are all sleeping! :P
[18:03:04] <Miles8of9> $('#tabfrm').delegate('input[type=checkbox]', 'change', function () {
[18:03:10] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:03:16] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[18:03:28] <Miles8of9> latest one.....
[18:03:54] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ -> "As of jQuery 3.0, .delegate() has been deprecated. It was superseded by the .on() method since jQuery 1.7 [...]"
[18:03:56] <Miles8of9> 3.3.1
[18:04:08] <Miles8of9> oh -_-
[18:04:15] <robertmaxrees> should be .on('event', 'element', function() {};
[18:04:17] <robertmaxrees> easy change
[18:05:08] <Miles8of9> $('#tabfrm').on('change', 'input[type=checkbox]', function () {
[18:05:09] <Miles8of9> ?
[18:05:12] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:06:32] <Miles8of9> ok...
[18:06:35] <Miles8of9> if ($(this).is(':checked')) { $("#schedulerCollapse").slideDown(100); } else { $("#schedulerCollapse").slideUp(100); }
[18:06:47] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[18:06:54] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[18:07:07] <Miles8of9> of course #schedulerCollapse can't be found if i manipulate the dom
[18:07:17] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:07:23] <robertmaxrees> are you removing that element?
[18:07:43] <Miles8of9> mm... no... it's part of a modal dialog i create on the fly
[18:07:53] <robertmaxrees> l;ol
[18:07:58] <robertmaxrees> so what's the problem?
[18:08:02] <robertmaxrees> you're being real cryptic.
[18:08:47] <Miles8of9> the problem is that i can't target an element suck as #schedulerCollapse because i manipulated the dom
[18:09:10] <robertmaxrees> "because i manipulated the dom" how?
[18:09:30] <robertmaxrees> even if you add that element after pageload, that code should work,
[18:10:08] <Miles8of9> i get new html code from a partial view and i insert it into the page after page has been loaded
[18:10:15] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[18:10:23] <robertmaxrees> *ok?
[18:10:28] <Miles8of9> hmm aspnet mvc.. bad beast..
[18:10:32] <robertmaxrees> is #tabfrm apart of that?
[18:11:08] <Miles8of9> #tabfrm is the placeholder div.... i manipulate what is inside it
[18:11:19] <robertmaxrees> do you also replace that element?
[18:11:30] <Miles8of9> mmm.... no.....
[18:11:38] <robertmaxrees> then i dunno without seeing the code.
[18:11:44] <robertmaxrees> changing its contents should have no bearing.
[18:11:51] <Miles8of9> $('#tabfrm').html(response);
[18:11:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd validate that your handler is even firing.
[18:12:01] <robertmaxrees> and that you're not duplicating that ID.
[18:12:28] <robertmaxrees> but you can target things that were created after pageload - that's not a problem.,
[18:13:22] <Miles8of9> tab.js:146 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeName' of undefined   -_-
[18:13:29] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:13:34] <robertmaxrees> so fix that error :)
[18:13:54] <Miles8of9> it says it can't find #tabfrm
[18:14:00] <Miles8of9> but it's there!
[18:14:02] <robertmaxrees> *What* does?
[18:14:11] <robertmaxrees> i can't see your code so i can't really help.
[18:14:51] <Miles8of9> <div id="tabfrm" class="container tab-pane fade pb-3">
[18:15:05] <Miles8of9> this is in the view...
[18:15:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:15:15] <robertmaxrees> dude
[18:15:18] <robertmaxrees> okay so like - you
[18:15:35] <Miles8of9> ?
[18:15:38] <robertmaxrees> *you're showing me js errors for code i can't see, and then a fragment of some html.
[18:15:47] <robertmaxrees> and some js that works fine.
[18:15:52] <robertmaxrees> i need a test case.
[18:16:09] <Miles8of9> too complicated code... -_-
[18:16:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:16:19] <robertmaxrees> ;p;
[18:16:20] <robertmaxrees> *lol
[18:16:43] <robertmaxrees> so how am i supposed to help if it's so complicated you can't even make a test case?
[18:18:36] <Miles8of9> for some reason it says it can't find #tabfrm... but it's there!!!
[18:18:38] <Miles8of9> -_-
[18:18:55] <robertmaxrees> you mean the error from earlier?
[18:19:02] <robertmaxrees> because that's not what that error means.
[18:19:52] <Miles8of9> $('#tabfrm').tab('show');
[18:20:00] <Miles8of9> this is the line that throws the error
[18:20:00] <robertmaxrees> so that's erroring?
[18:20:24] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id="tabfrm"]').length) right before that line
[18:20:38] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[18:20:58] <Miles8of9> 1
[18:21:01] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:21:05] <robertmaxrees> so the element exists.
[18:21:14] <robertmaxrees> are you using bootstrap there?
[18:21:31] <Miles8of9> yes the page uses bs4
[18:21:45] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:21:49] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navs/#via-javascript
[18:21:53] <robertmaxrees> so what looks wrong with your code?
[18:22:43] <robertmaxrees> is #tabfrm the container for all those tabs?
[18:23:24] <Miles8of9> no it's the container of one tab
[18:23:42] <robertmaxrees> okay.  but it'
[18:23:47] <robertmaxrees> *it's not the <a> ?
[18:24:01] <Miles8of9> no
[18:24:09] <robertmaxrees> that's likely your problen.,
[18:24:44] <robertmaxrees> or at least the div needs to have the proper attributes on it.
[18:24:49] <Miles8of9> <a class="nav-link" data-toggle="tab" href="#tabfrm">xxxxxx</a>
[18:24:57] <Miles8of9> this is the link
[18:25:05] <Miles8of9> should i give it a name?
[18:25:24] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navs/#javascript-behavior
[18:25:24] <Miles8of9> id
[18:25:29] <robertmaxrees> look at these examples
[18:33:06] <Miles8of9> it works now :P
[18:33:08] <Miles8of9> thanks
[18:33:51] <robertmaxrees> rad
[18:34:18] <Miles8of9> do you know aspnet mvc?
[18:34:51] <robertmaxrees> it'
[18:34:55] <robertmaxrees> *it's been a few years
[18:35:07] <Miles8of9> i need to pass a datetime object from jquery to the aspnet controller and let the modelbinder convert it to c# datetime object
[18:35:32] <robertmaxrees> we can help with the client-side part, but server-side is gonna be a crapshoot
[18:36:08] <Miles8of9> the jquery component i'm using is fullcalendar
[18:36:18] <robertmaxrees> so what do you need help with?
[18:36:44] <Miles8of9> when you click on some cell inside it an event is triggered
[18:37:16] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[18:37:22] <Miles8of9> dayClick: function (date, jsEvent, view, resourceObj) {
[18:37:31] <Miles8of9> date is a js date
[18:38:06] <Miles8of9> i can pass the date to aspnet but i get an error because on ":" characters inside it
[18:38:15] <robertmaxrees> well.
[18:38:27] <robertmaxrees> those are pretty standard for datetime objects from JS>
[18:38:35] <robertmaxrees> are you sure you're correctly parsing them server-side?
[18:39:02] <Miles8of9>  /Activity/?"2018-06-21T18:00:00"
[18:39:14] <Miles8of9> that's the parameter
[18:39:28] <robertmaxrees> your first problem is that's not a valid URL.
[18:40:01] <robertmaxrees> querystring params are often name=value
[18:40:10] <robertmaxrees> that has a name but no value.
[18:40:38] <Miles8of9> .... /Activity/?%222018-06-21T18:00:00%22
[18:40:41] <Miles8of9> that was
[18:40:46] <robertmaxrees> errr
[18:40:49] <Miles8of9> ok ok
[18:40:52] <robertmaxrees> you're still not giving it a name or a value
[18:41:02] <robertmaxrees> ?datetime=2018-06-21T18:00:
[18:41:02] <robertmaxrees> 00
[18:41:25] <robertmaxrees> erm, ?datetime=2018-06-21T18:00:00
[18:41:30] <Miles8of9> mm
[18:41:43] <robertmaxrees> however
[18:41:56] <robertmaxrees> are you requestion information from the server?  or are you trying to send information?
[18:42:12] <robertmaxrees> *requesting
[18:42:24] <Miles8of9> $.ajax({type: 'GET', url: url, data: JSON.stringify(date), success: function (response) {
[18:42:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked
[18:42:39] <Caspan_> i ahve a table and I am trying to get the data-id from the first child.. https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/281872/  what am i doing wrong
[18:42:52] <Miles8of9> data is sent... answer is received but parameter is not parsed
[18:43:09] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 are you trying to get information, or save information?
[18:43:23] <Miles8of9> get
[18:43:27] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 ok
[18:43:50] <Miles8of9> the ajax is asking the server to send a form
[18:43:51] <robertmaxrees> i would change data: to data: { dateTime: date }
[18:43:58] <Miles8of9> ok
[18:44:00] <robertmaxrees> Caspan_ $(this).first() is your issue.
[18:44:27] <Caspan_> well it will return an object then i want the first object after that objject
[18:44:33] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the specific element that was clicked, and .first() is getting the first element from that $(this)
[18:44:41] <Caspan_> yes
[18:44:43] <robertmaxrees> Caspan_ "the first object after that object":?
[18:44:48] <robertmaxrees> you mean the next TD?
[18:44:53] <Caspan_> yes
[18:44:55] <Caspan_> in this case
[18:45:00] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:45:03] <robertmaxrees> "in this case"?
[18:45:07] <robertmaxrees> will there be other cases?
[18:45:10] <Caspan_> it might not be a td always
[18:45:15] <robertmaxrees> so.
[18:45:20] <robertmaxrees> any reason that ID isn't oin the TR?
[18:45:25] <Caspan_> i always want the first element after the element you clicked on
[18:45:35] <Caspan_> yes
[18:45:48] <Caspan_> all the data is pulled form that td
[18:46:01] <robertmaxrees> i'
[18:46:02] <Caspan_> it gets marked as selected and then information is pulled form the selected TD
[18:46:06] <robertmaxrees> *i'm questioning why.
[18:46:16] <robertmaxrees> since if you stick that on the TR this becomes trivial
[18:46:31] <Caspan_> i know but it breaks everything else
[18:46:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:46:37] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[18:46:42] <Caspan_> the way my JS pulls vaules for form submition
[18:46:46] <Caspan_> it jsut is sorry
[18:46:47] <robertmaxrees> :/
[18:46:59] <robertmaxrees> either way, $(this).find('.SelectedColumn'
[18:47:05] <robertmaxrees> ^ i'd do something like this.
[18:47:07] <Caspan_> i cant explain whole program to you just want to use that code to get the first element under this one and get the data-id form it
[18:47:28] <Caspan_> not meaning to be rude sorry
[18:47:33] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you want something like $(this).find('td').first();
[18:47:50] <Caspan_> why cant i use the firts() ?
[18:47:54] <Caspan_> geeze
[18:48:00] <Caspan_> why cant i use .first()
[18:48:10] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:48:15] <Caspan_> just curious
[18:48:18] <robertmaxrees> because first() isn't what you wnat.
[18:48:18] <Miles8of9> data: { dateTime: date },
[18:48:31] <Miles8of9> Uncaught TypeError: this.day is not a function
[18:48:48] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 dunno.  would need to see more.
[18:48:53] <Caspan_> see wheni test $('.clickable > td').first().data('id')
[18:48:54] <Caspan_>   that works fine to return it
[18:49:15] <robertmaxrees> ah wait.
[18:49:20] <robertmaxrees> back way up.
[18:49:21] <Caspan_> does $('.clickable > td')   not jsut get replaced with $(this)
[18:49:34] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i mispoke.
[18:49:35] <robertmaxrees> but
[18:49:39] <Caspan_> np
[18:49:53] <robertmaxrees> $('.clickable > td') is ALL tds under "clickable"
[18:50:02] <robertmaxrees> and then you're getting the first of all of them.
[18:50:03] <Caspan_> yes
[18:50:06] <Caspan_> yep
[18:50:06] <robertmaxrees> $(this) could be any td.
[18:50:11] <robertmaxrees> but it's only one element.
[18:50:13] <robertmaxrees> ever
[18:50:15] <Caspan_> ohhh
[18:50:23] <robertmaxrees> so really.
[18:50:23] <Caspan_> im one level too deep
[18:50:29] <Caspan_> duhh
[18:50:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1nrca5kt/2/
[18:51:04] <robertmaxrees> you want something more like this.
[18:51:51] <Caspan_> thats a whole bunch of undefined :)
[18:51:58] <Caspan_> but i get what ou are saying
[18:52:05] <Caspan_> ill tweak my code
[18:52:07] <Caspan_> thank you
[18:52:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/edcvh23o/
[18:52:27] <robertmaxrees> .find('.SelectedColumn'
[18:52:29] <robertmaxrees> forgot the perido.
[18:52:33] <robertmaxrees> *period
[18:52:59] <Caspan_> yep
[18:53:01] <Caspan_> got it
[18:53:03] <Caspan_> thank you
[18:53:31] <Caspan_> my logic is broken with Jquery
[18:53:48] <Caspan_> its hard to think so dimensional sometimes
[18:54:05] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:54:13] <robertmaxrees> it's not dimensionality, really.
[18:54:16] <robertmaxrees> it's all a tree.
[18:54:30] <Caspan_> well i think about it as nested objects
[18:54:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:54:41] <robertmaxrees> that's why you're having issues :)
[18:54:41] <Caspan_> objectes inside of objects :)
[18:54:54] <robertmaxrees> since that's not really what's happening.
[18:56:18] <Caspan_> i think about it as one big array :)
[18:56:25] <robertmaxrees> even worse heh
[18:56:28] <Caspan_> and you dig down into it
[18:56:30] <Caspan_> haha i know
[18:56:33] <robertmaxrees> since that's not what it is at all.
[18:56:43] <robertmaxrees> that's why you're having a hard time with your mental model.
[18:57:44] <Miles8of9> this format is accepted by aspnet... what is %3A   /Calendar?start=2018-06-04T00%3A00%3A00
[18:57:56] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 so it needs to be escaped
[18:58:18] <robertmaxrees> *encoded, rather
[18:58:18] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent
[19:00:51] <Caspan_> thnaks
[19:00:54] <Caspan_> ill have a read
[19:01:03] <robertmaxrees> that was for Miles8of9 :)
[19:02:00] <Caspan_> oh okay
[19:02:14] <Caspan_> was looking at it strange :)
[19:02:23] <robertmaxrees> hah
[19:02:29] <Caspan_> like no idea what this has to do with what I did but il read
[19:02:38] <robertmaxrees> woops
[19:17:10] <Miles8of9> time comes when you find the solution by complete luck :P
[19:17:31] <Miles8of9> data: { id: date.format() },
