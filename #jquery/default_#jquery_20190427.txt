[02:06:33] <COOurb> I'm trying to get parent element of $(this) from function, but $(this).parent() returns object with length 0
[02:55:51] <diverdude> Hi, I am trying to color a row in a table green and then fade it back to white. I am doing like this: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/NsxB5CVJkj/ but for some reason its not fading back to white. What am I missing?

[03:10:51] <pavonia> My previous answer
[03:13:49] <diverdude> pavonia: oh - i did not see your answer because i got disconnected
[03:14:17] <diverdude> pavonia: can you put it here again maybe?
[03:15:56] <pavonia> The animate documentations ays: "For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless the jQuery.Color plugin is used"
[03:17:05] <pavonia> COOurb: Are you sure the element referenced by $(this) is the element you expect it to be?
[03:22:16] <COOurb> yeah, already found. I didn't pass this into finction. Didn't know that I should
[03:22:48] <COOurb> also, is there any way to catch changes of input textfield?
[03:23:07] <COOurb> because change() fires only if testfield loses focus
[03:25:28] <COOurb> textfield*
[03:26:23] <diverdude> pavonia: i see.
[03:26:55] <pavonia> COOurb: on("input")
[03:27:20] <diverdude> pavonia: i just want to show background color X and then set it back to Y after a short period...can it be done in another way?
[03:28:18] <pavonia> You could use .delay
[03:29:13] <COOurb> thnx
[03:30:13] <diverdude> pavonia: ok - can you show me a short example?
[03:32:35] <diverdude> pavonia: i thought it was like this: $(this).closest("tr").css( "background-color", "#90EE90" ).delay( 800 ).css( "background-color", "#FFF" )
[03:32:45] <diverdude> pavonia: but seems like not working
[03:33:35] <pavonia> Looks corrct. What happens when you try?
[03:33:42] <diverdude> pavonia: nothing
[03:34:41] <pavonia> Hhm
[03:35:39] <diverdude> if i only do $(this).closest("tr").css( "background-color", "#90EE90" ) it gets colored green as expected....but when i add the delay then nothing happens
[03:37:01] <pavonia> You could also use plain JS setTimeout
[03:37:24] <diverdude> pavonia: but shouldnt this delay work?
[03:37:27] <pavonia> Also see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5396119/using-jquery-delay-with-css
[03:40:36] <diverdude> bahhh that SO also dont work :(
[03:52:25] <diverdude> why is the row not getting green when i click the button? https://jsfiddle.net/ju8bx5q3/1/
[03:54:22] <diverdude> sorry, i meant this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/6k4cth0u/
[03:56:08] <diverdude> ahhh it works now :)

[09:12:32] <spinningCat> when you detach element and assign to variable, you still can access class of div or .data ?
[09:12:55] <spinningCat> hmm

[10:10:30] <ExoUNX> morning
[10:10:35] <thykka> hi
[10:11:23] <ExoUNX> I want to toggle a class using something like $(this).$(".child.selector"), this doesn't seem to be correct
[10:11:28] <ExoUNX> how would I do that?
[10:11:52] <thykka> ExoUNX, $(this).toggleClass('yourClass')
[10:11:58] <thykka> or
[10:12:14] <ExoUNX> what I want to toggle a class for a child selector of this
[10:12:56] <ExoUNX> because currently it will toggle all instances of that class, but I only want to toggle the class of the clicked parent
[10:12:59] <thykka> $(this).find('.someChildElement').toggleClass('someClass')
[10:15:55] <ExoUNX> thykka thank you
[10:16:18] <ExoUNX> makes sense and I thought that might work but I thought there was different way
[10:19:17] <thykka> there's almost always a different way
[10:26:17] <ExoUNX> also, what's a good way of applying these click functions only to specific media queries?
[10:27:26] <spinningCat> thankks thykka
[10:28:29] <ExoUNX> I guess to better explain what I'm trying to do..I only want toggleClass to work if I'm in a mobile view
[10:28:44] <thykka> err. why?
[10:28:53] <thykka> what does the class do?
[10:29:18] <ExoUNX> So I have navbar and in desktop view, the dropdown appears on hover. In mobile view the dropdown appears on click
[10:29:56] <ExoUNX> However, currently if you click on the navbar on desktop, the dropdown stays instead of going away if you unhover
[10:37:26] <ExoUNX> thykka that make sense lol?
[10:38:34] <thykka> yes, but you could place the mobile styles in a media query, so that they won't affect the desktop version
[10:39:10] <thykka> i.e. let the class be toggled on desktop too, just don't let it have an effect
[10:39:38] <ExoUNX> well it toggles is-active (bulma selector)
[10:41:04] <thykka> doen't bulma readily provide such functionality? https://bulma.io/documentation/components/dropdown/
[10:42:28] <ExoUNX> I'm using - https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/
[10:42:56] <ExoUNX> and I am using the is-active jquery implementation
[10:44:21] <ExoUNX> here's to the specific example - https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/#navbar-menu
[10:45:05] <thykka> :F
[10:45:09] <thykka> that's just awful
[10:45:40] <thykka> forces JS or duplicating HTML
[10:45:41] <ExoUNX> well it is just an example, but there's a better way of doing it then?
[10:46:27] <thykka> the one I described earlier? and many other ways, bulma's way just seems stupid to me
[10:46:39] <ExoUNX> that's racist
[10:47:25] <ExoUNX> but where do you mean "described earlier"
[10:47:33] <ExoUNX> you mean the dropdown page you sent me?
[10:47:46] <thykka> use media-queries to determine screen-size based behavior, not js
[10:48:42] <ExoUNX> well I don't need to use media queries within JS, but I wanted those jquery events to only apply to mobile view within the same limits as the media query
[10:49:37] <thykka> I'm not familiar enough with bulma to speculate on how it should be used
[10:50:33] <ExoUNX> well I think bulma is ultimately irrelevant here. I just want to toggle a class on mobile only
[10:51:06] <thykka> you took a framework, so you should be doing things as the framework dictates
[10:51:39] <thykka> i mean sure, you could always monkey-patch the framework, but that's not a very maintainable solution
[10:51:58] <thykka> better would be to learn what the "bulma way" is, regarding this issue
[10:52:04] <ExoUNX> I don't think it has a specific way to handle things
[10:52:10] <thykka> of course it has
[10:52:15] <thykka> all frameworks have
[10:52:19] <ExoUNX> I mean, "is-active" is about as bulma-way as it gets
[10:52:41] <thykka> that, and also that .navbar-menu gets automagically hidden at <1024px
[10:52:49] <thykka> those are some pretty strong design decisions
[10:53:00] <thykka> opinionated, even
[10:53:21] <thykka> so when you buy into a framework, it would be weird not to buy into it's opinions
[10:53:46] <thykka> why use such a framework in the first place, if you're just gonna invent your own rules, that go against how the framework was designed?
[10:55:59] <ExoUNX> I really don't know why we're getting philosophical...
[10:56:06] <ExoUNX> like what?
[10:56:18] <ExoUNX> all I wanted was to toggle a class on mobile only :(
[10:57:31] <thykka> because programming is not just about getting from point A to point B, but to also do that in an efficient, maintainable, readable and a smart way.
[10:57:58] <thykka> every decision you make, has the potential to bite your ass later
[10:58:12] <ExoUNX> I agree to that, yet you use jQuery?
[10:58:18] <thykka> I rarely do
[10:58:37] <ExoUNX> fair enough then
[10:59:38] <ExoUNX> so should I just reinvent the wheel just to do it a little bit better?
[10:59:54] <ExoUNX> or is there a css framework that you feel does it "right?"
[11:00:09] <thykka> no, you should follow your chosen framework, instead of reinventing the wheel within it
[11:00:37] <ExoUNX> I followed their example for the navbar and their jquery example
[11:00:38] <thykka> that said, I think bulma's way is stupid, and I personally wouldn't choose it as my framework, if this is an accurate representation of the kind of choices they've made
[11:00:52] <ExoUNX> and it was a simple example, not a comprehensive one to address mobile afaik
[11:01:23] <ExoUNX> thykka well do you have a preferred css framrwork?
[11:01:37] <thykka> $(window).resize(_=> { if($(window).width() <= 480) { /* it's mobile */ } })
[11:02:44] <thykka> ExoUNX, not really, I'm more into component-based libraries, than all-encompassing frameworks
[11:03:20] <ExoUNX> well I am using vue.js which falls under the same methodology I believe
[11:03:41] <ExoUNX> so would there a "navbar"-based library then?
[11:03:52] <ExoUNX> or how would that work
[11:04:27] <thykka> perhaps. I would probably just re-use a navbar component from my earlier projects, or write one from scratch to best fit the scenario at hand
[11:04:47] <thykka> you can write that up as NIH-syndrome
[11:04:49] <thykka> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:05:49] <thykka> for grids, I use a custom thing that very much resembles this, but is nicer to work with and doesn't include the fluff that's not gonna be used in 95% of cases; http://flexboxgrid.com/
[11:06:23] <ExoUNX> definitely NIH-syndrome ;) Not that existing frameworks/libraries are perfect, but I try and avoid reinvent the wheel unless it's absolutely a better way of doing it otherwise
[11:07:25] <ExoUNX> Lots of bloats with things like jQuery, Bulma, Vue
[11:07:51] <ExoUNX> but hell, I'm using framrworks for the entire application
[11:08:14] <ExoUNX> Buffalo (Go), Bulma (CSS), Vue (JS), jQuery (JS)
[11:09:01] <ExoUNX> lol and it seems most Go devs HATE frameworks xD
[11:10:37] <ExoUNX> to be fair, css grid has made setting up basic structures a lot easier
[11:13:16] <thykka> slightly worried about IE10/11 and pre 4.4.4 Android compatibility there.. but yes, they're great if one only needs to target evergreen browsers
[11:13:57] <thykka> not that flex is problem-free on IE10/11 either..
[11:14:23] <ExoUNX> right, luckily IE10/IE11 are pretty dead (not entirely)
[11:14:46] <ExoUNX> and Edge is switching to evergreen (chromium) for better or worse
[11:15:05] <thykka> we have some enterprise clients with enterprise needs :X
[11:15:35] <ExoUNX> Enterprise doesn't ALWAYS mean outdated and insecure ;)
[11:16:30] <ExoUNX> But if you're target audience are businesses that use outdated software, then it's understandable
[11:16:36] <ExoUNX> your*
[11:17:40] <thykka> isn't that like the norm, rather than an exception? :P
[11:17:51] <ExoUNX> also, Microsoft is pushing to finally kill Windows 7 in enterprise environments so there's hope for a better web
[11:18:31] <thykka> according to statcounter, there's still almost 2% of people on winXP
[11:18:45] <thykka> 33% on win7
[11:19:04] <thykka> M$ can push, but they can only do so much
[11:19:22] <ExoUNX> I myself don't know many businesses that use IE on a regular basis. I know of some that grudgingly use IE for legacy applications, but don't for everything else.
[11:19:50] <ExoUNX> 33% on Win7 and most use Chrome or Firefox
[11:20:25] <ExoUNX> https://caniuse.com/#search=grid - 90% isn't that bad
[11:20:38] <ExoUNX> I wouldn't use if it were 60%
[11:21:15] <thykka> it's really good, and if I were making public-facing websited, I'd almost certainly use it
[11:21:22] <thykka> s/sited/sites
[11:22:40] <ExoUNX> That'd be the reverse for me
[11:23:02] <ExoUNX> because for private websites you have more control on what browser someone would use I'd think
[11:23:13] <ExoUNX> you can't control how the public connects to your site
[11:23:51] <ExoUNX> but you could advocate for Chrome (or whatever browser) that suites your application best in a business environment
[11:25:59] <ExoUNX> I think most businesses trust Chrome compared to a possibly more stable IE
[11:27:04] <ExoUNX> but there a businesses that manage every last detail on endpoints possibly making them avoid Chrome because Google could break something at anytime
[11:27:14] <ExoUNX> compared to security-only updates for IE
[11:28:34] <ExoUNX> Google and Chromium could break something*
