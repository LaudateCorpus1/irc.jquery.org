[00:00:21] <doug16k> DreamStiffler, you know crossdomain ajax doesnt work that easily right?
[00:00:31] <doug16k> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?{%22q%22:%22select%20*%20from%20ht…lass=\%22bm_news\%22]%27%22,%22format%22:%22json%22,%22callback%22:%22?%22}. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://fiddle.jshell.net' is therefore not allowed access.
[00:00:47] <DreamStiffler> CORS?
[00:00:50] <doug16k> yes
[00:01:08] <doug16k> so... I can test the code...
[00:01:12] <DreamStiffler> or fiddle doesnt allow
[00:01:18] <DreamStiffler> hmmmh
[00:01:26] <DreamStiffler> ok let me try that on my local
[00:04:01] <DreamStiffler> it doesnt work here locally
[00:04:06] <DreamStiffler> im gna try have a look at it
[00:04:12] <DreamStiffler> itll be a while
[00:04:19] <DreamStiffler> thanks in advance though

[00:43:54] <arup_r> what is on_init() function ?  https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/ff4c005ed33cf9b59b99#file-calender-js-L69
[00:45:07] <arup_r> didn't find anything -- https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/ff4c005ed33cf9b59b99#file-calender-js-L69

[00:50:59] <doug16k> arup_r, a global or a crash waiting to happen
[00:52:41] <doug16k> arup_r, it's defined somewhere else if it works
[00:54:47] <arup_r> why crash ? doug16k :
[00:55:35] <doug16k> if you do on_init() and on_init is undefined, it will throw an exception because undefined isn't callable
[00:56:19] <doug16k> unhandled exception abandons further execution
[00:56:27] <doug16k> I call that a "crash"
[00:56:59] <arup_r> ok.. but I took this code from a running app's asset directory.. I was reading the code.. but didn't get it. that's why I came here

[00:57:20] <doug16k> arup_r, it must get defined when it loads some other js file. it looks global
[00:57:41] <arup_r> ok.. that sounds cool
[01:09:55] <arthurvr> stangeland: you just mean like this? http://jsbin.com/xopovajura/1/
[01:11:38] <arthurvr> stangeland: Or more likely something like pretty-ms? https://github.com/sindresorhus/pretty-ms

[03:44:36] <arthurvr> [c]afeine: This is a jQuery channel. Maybe you should try in #web?
[03:45:32] <[c]afeine> thank you GingerGeek
[03:45:53] <GingerGeek> what
[03:46:02] <sacho_> GingerGeek, use a .each
[03:46:04] <GingerGeek> It's a jquery issue
[03:46:17] <arthurvr> GingerGeek: It, in fact, isn’t.
[03:46:34] <GingerGeek> But it's jquery ui?
[03:46:35] <arthurvr> GingerGeek: this refers to the the window in your case.
[03:46:41] <GingerGeek> What
[03:46:45] <GingerGeek> Im confuzzled
[03:47:03] <arthurvr> GingerGeek: I’m talking about the fiddle you posted.
[03:47:14] <GingerGeek> Yeah that's an example
[03:47:26] <GingerGeek> Showing that it isn't being limited
[03:47:32] <GingerGeek> the containment isn't working as intended

[03:49:56] <GingerGeek> Thank you so much :D
[03:50:11] <GingerGeek> Why do I have to use this though?
[03:50:14] <arthurvr> and you was just a few seconds quicker :)
[03:50:22] <arthurvr> you was using this in the outer scope.
[03:50:34] <arthurvr> then, it refers to the `window` object.
[03:50:49] <GingerGeek> Ohhhh
[03:50:53] <GingerGeek> That makes sense
[03:50:54] <arthurvr> now, in the each call, it refers to the selected elemtn.

[04:26:16] <Huss> Hi there i need someones help with jquery/javacsript
[04:27:10] <Huss> Anyone here?
[04:27:24] <Huss> hello?
[04:27:26] <Huss> any pros?
[04:28:47] <arthurvr> Hi Huss !
[04:28:55] <arthurvr> !ask @ Huss
[04:28:55] <b-ot> Huss: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:29:31] <Huss> Okay all my jquery and javascript quick view, mega menu, mobile menu has stopped working?
[04:29:48] <Huss>  0 down vote favorite 	  The jQuery was updated from 1.7.2 to 1.11.2 and the Mobile Menu, Mega Menu, Quick View etc has stopped working on the site. I have replaced it back to 1.7.2 but I am still facing the same error, so I've kept it at 1.11.2 and included the jQuery migrate.
[04:30:01] <arthurvr> Is the site only somewhere?
[04:30:09] <arthurvr> Can you take a look at your console?
[04:30:16] <Huss> yea
[04:30:17] <Huss> its live
[04:30:25] <Huss> http://www.toscatravelgoods.com.au/
[04:30:43] <arthurvr> Huss: Is the bug live as well?
[04:30:53] <Huss> its using this theme blueprint https://blueprint-demo.mybigcommerce.com/
[04:30:54] <Huss> yeah
[04:31:49] <Huss> Can you see the problem?
[04:31:58] <arthurvr> Not directly.
[04:32:25] <arthurvr> First of all I see a 404 in the console. Maybe you should take care of that first?
[04:32:40] <arthurvr> It might be unrelated, but might as well be the blocker.
[04:32:42] <Huss> whats the 404?
[04:32:51] <Huss> that you see?
[04:32:52] <arthurvr> template/Styles/tabs.gif Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
[04:33:35] <Huss> are you using firefox console - i cant see that error
[04:35:27] <arthurvr> http://gyazo.com/e8e7425c913cef872fa6f63aebe98a3b
[04:35:47] <arthurvr> Chrome 43, osx yosemite
[04:36:19] <Huss> @arthurvr you think this may be blocking the jquery and javascript?
[04:36:59] <arthurvr> Why not?
[04:37:45] <arthurvr> You know the codebase better then me, but if you’re having issues with the views that makes sense.
[04:38:45] <Huss> let me try recover this file - no idea why this is  missing. yeah nothing working javascript wise like the Mega menu, mobile menu blog
[04:45:11] <jop008> Hi I try to find a elements like this $('a .ui-btn').each(function (index) {
[04:45:17] <jop008> I got no results
[04:45:41] <jop008> but I have a elements with class ui-btn
[04:46:50] <arthurvr> jop008: what are you trying to do with that each loop?
[04:47:38] <jop008> find collapsible a elements
[04:48:14] <arthurvr> jop008: Maybe it’s a good idea to create jsfiddle/jsbin?
[04:48:15] <arthurvr> !paste
[04:48:15] <b-ot> arthurvr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:50:23] <jop008> when I do it soley on class I got the element
[04:53:43] <Huss> @arthurvr i have placed a transparent gif but this still didnt seem to fix the problem so i have removed it, any other ideas as to why my javascript jquery has stopped
[04:54:49] <arthurvr> Huss: the actual error it is throwing comes from the autobox function.
[04:54:55] <arthurvr> jQuery.fn.autobox is undefined.
[04:55:20] <Huss> what should i do there aurthurvr?
[04:55:30] <Huss> arthurvr*
[04:56:22] <arthurvr> Where should that function normally be defined?
[04:56:32] <Huss> looks like the init.js
[04:57:25] <arthurvr> no there you call it. You need the file that defines it.
[04:57:28] <arthurvr> anyways gotta run
[04:57:35] <arthurvr> will be back in an hour
[04:57:49] <Huss> how can i find it - someone overwrote the js for us.
[04:59:02] <Huss> jquery.autobox.js
[05:08:42] <Huss> Anyone online to help with that error of mien?
[05:08:44] <Huss> mine*
[05:13:58] <Huss> hello
[05:14:03] <Huss> need help with error.
[05:14:05] <Huss> anyone there
[05:14:32] <sacho_> don't ask to ask
[05:20:11] <arthurvr> Huss: I’m back!
[05:20:25] <arthurvr> Earlier than I expected to be back, but let’s dig in.
[05:22:39] <Huss> welcome back arthur
[05:22:40] <Huss> yes please
[05:23:27] <arthurvr> jquery.autobox.js isn’t loaded into the page.
[05:23:59] <Huss> <script src="%%GLOBAL_TPL_PATH%%/js/jquery.autobox.js"></script>
[05:24:00] <Huss> its there
[05:25:03] <arthurvr> ah I see
[05:26:05] <arthurvr> Huss: Kinda weird. Are you sure you’re not including multiple versions of jQuery?
[05:26:41] <Huss> let me double check
[05:27:40] <Huss> omg that was it
[05:27:52] <arthurvr> issue solved I guess?
[05:28:57] <Huss> yes !! omg
[05:29:02] <Huss> thank you so much arthurvr!
[05:29:06] <arthurvr> my pleasure.
[05:29:14] <Huss> are you always on this chat?
[05:29:17] <Huss> do you have personal email or skype.
[05:29:56] <Huss> Your a legend matee!
[05:36:01] <arthurvr> Huss: I’m not always around but ZNC catches all my messages, so feel free to ask me anything in here.
[05:37:08] <Huss> Great thanks
[05:37:20] <Huss> now im facing another error with the site
[05:37:30] <arthurvr> shoot
[05:37:57] <Huss> I cannot register or guest checkout when processing to checkout page
[05:38:21] <arthurvr> You think it’s a front-end issue? Otherwise you this isn’t the best place to ask it.
[05:38:39] <Huss> yep ill get onto it
[05:38:39] <Huss> thanks
[05:45:48] <Huss> arthuervr
[05:45:56] <Huss> it looks like its javascript issue here
[05:46:18] <Huss> as the upgrade from 1.7.2 to 1.11.2
[05:46:53] <arthurvr> Okay. Maybe you should first to reduce the problem and jsfiddle it? It helps us to locate the bug.
[05:46:56] <arthurvr> !paste
[05:46:56] <b-ot> arthurvr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:47:28] <Huss> https://www.toscatravelgoods.com.au/checkout.php#
[05:47:32] <Huss> errors on that page.
[05:47:39] <Huss> too much to paste within jsfiddle.
[05:48:03] <arthurvr> jQuery is not defined, $ is not defined <- right in the console
[05:48:14] <arthurvr> might directly be your problem
[05:48:25] <Huss> how do i fix this
[05:48:36] <arthurvr> ah I see
[05:48:56] <arthurvr> you load jquery as first thing in the <head>, which is good, but go take a look at its url.
[05:49:06] <arthurvr> you include http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js
[05:49:12] <Huss> ye
[05:49:14] <arthurvr> and the page is loaded over https.
[05:49:25] <arthurvr> browsers don’t like that.
[05:49:32] <arthurvr> That’s called ”mixed content"
[05:49:41] <Huss> ah so i need to change this
[05:49:52] <arthurvr> a page loaded over https will never load resources over http. That’s the rule :)
[05:50:00] <arthurvr> so make the link tag https.
[05:50:55] <Huss> okay great
[05:50:58] <Huss> got the errors out the way
[05:51:06] <Huss> but im having an alert pop up
[05:51:07] <Huss> now
[05:51:08] <Huss> argh!
[05:51:21] <Huss> never selling another client this cms!
[05:51:28] <Huss> any idea what the alert means?
[05:51:30] <arthurvr> I don’t see any on that page?
[05:51:50] <Huss> There was an error loading this step of the checkout. Please try again.
[05:51:54] <Huss> https://www.toscatravelgoods.com.au/checkout.php
[05:52:12] <arthurvr> Okay so we still have 2 errors. Let’s take a look.
[05:52:21] <arthurvr> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request)
[05:52:24] <Huss> yep
[05:52:33] <arthurvr> so that’s a backend problem.
[05:52:56] <arthurvr> Search for the route for https://www.toscatravelgoods.com.au/%%GLOBAL_QuickViewProductURL%%
[05:53:19] <arthurvr> Anyways I think the front-end problems are solved?
[05:53:26] <Huss> yeah
[05:53:31] <Huss> thats great!
[05:53:34] <Huss> but
[05:53:39] <Prabhat> How to use jquery ajax in input type number?
[05:53:40] <Huss> that backend stuff
[05:53:57] <arthurvr> Prabhat: What do you want to do with the <input>?
[05:54:42] <Prabhat> Sir I want to post number of quantity by number control?
[05:54:51] <arthurvr> Let me fiddle something for you;
[05:54:57] <Prabhat> In shopping cart
[05:55:12] <Prabhat> Ok
[05:57:54] <arthurvr> Prabhat: you mean something like this? http://codepen.io/arthur_versch/pen/azaLMK
[05:58:21] <Prabhat> OK wait ...I see
[05:58:31] <arthurvr> Prabhat: the above is pretty basic, try to modify it to your needs, I can help you fixing it if you run into any problems
[05:59:24] <arthurvr> Prabhat: also, if you don’t understand something in the code, ping me.
[05:59:45] <Prabhat> Sir it is almost ..but I want it with jquery?
[05:59:57] <arthurvr> It’s jQuery.
[06:00:01] <Prabhat> ajax.post
[06:00:08] <arthurvr> jQuery.post I used
[06:00:16] <arthurvr> `api jQuery.post @ Prabhat
[06:00:16] <b-ot> Prabhat: jQuery.post(): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[06:00:41] <Prabhat> I want to use ajax
[06:00:49] <esko> stupid design question.. using flask and mongodb as backend... i have a create/edit form where i use selectize.js to store values for exercies. i store the values in an array in the exercise itself. and thinking to search all arrays inside the exercise collection to get previous entries. would i rather create a new collection for these items and then save the ID with each exercise instead?
[06:00:59] <arthurvr> jQuery.post is just a shorthand for a jQuery.ajax call, Prabhat.
[06:01:18] <Prabhat> OK thank u sir
[06:01:40] <Prabhat> You solved my problem
[06:02:03] <arthurvr> Prabhat: as an FYI, this is what jQuery.post does: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/9d1b989f20b550af3590691723b0620f6914626e/src/ajax.js#L798
[06:02:07] <arthurvr> It’s just a shorthand.
[06:04:13] <arthurvr> esko: That’s not front-end related isn’t it?
[06:04:51] <esko> arthurvr i'm asking because you're all knowledgable ppl =)
[06:07:06] <arthurvr> esko: We would all love to help you out, but this is #jquery :)) Other people are way smarter with this than us.
[06:07:24] <arthurvr> esko: I guess #mongodb is the right place to ask about this.
[06:08:42] <esko> i guess :)
[06:08:46] <esko> thanks
[06:22:52] <feedme> Why this not working? http://jsfiddle.net/eu6kbw9u/
[06:22:55] <jop008> Hi I treid to create a nice looking tooltip just next to a lable http://pastebin.com/N9BYu1n4 but not exactly positioned well
[06:23:12] <arthurvr> nice try, feedme!
[06:23:15] <arthurvr> But gotcha
[06:24:05] <arthurvr> jop008: would you mind dumping your code in a jsfiddle? then we can see how it looks like, use devtools, ...
[06:24:22] <arthurvr> also we need an executable testcase :))
[06:25:20] <arthurvr> For everyone who is looking at feedme’s jsfiddle, he just replaced the semicolon with a greek question mark.
[06:25:25] <arthurvr> good old joke
[06:42:34] <jop008> I am trying to create a tooltip like this http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/popup/ in a label on a from but the layout is not nice
[06:43:00] <jop008> The one showed on A paragraph with a tooltip
[06:58:48] <jop008> I failed to make a jsfiddle this is my issue http://picpaste.com/upload.php the alignment of the input box with its label is not correct see code here http://pastebin.com/5Yrb6We5
[06:59:47] <Es0teric> i am trying to send a ajax post request from a http domain to a https

[07:20:15] <Alex-xd> -7- I Like the Shit┌∩┐(◣_◢)┌∩┐
[07:25:59] <jop008> does someone has a jqm 1.4.5 fiddle?
[07:39:38] <weaksauce> arthurvr yes still having that problem
[07:40:15] <arthurvr> Just so other people can follow
[07:40:17] <arthurvr> ”I was messing with getJSON locally on my computer and was getting a cannot get data from that file. cross origin scripts are only allowed from http, data... etc.”
[07:40:26] <arthurvr> ” is there a way to do a json request locally?”
[07:40:54] <arthurvr> weaksauce: The only way to do them locally is by running a local webserver? (that’s quite easy, in fact)
[07:40:58] <weaksauce> with the getjson cross domain thing even though it's all on my local computer
[07:41:29] <arthurvr> yes. For security reasons, browser don’t allow that. You can just run a local http server and everything will work fine.
[07:41:42] <arthurvr> Do you know how to do that, or shall I give you some instructions?
[07:46:27] <arthurvr> weaksauce: ^
[07:52:58] <DreamStiffler> hi. I have a dynamic data that i receive that i need to append into each existing divs. Example. 5 exiting div. and 5 dynamic data retrieved in single call. my plan is to have this data split (maybe into array) and inserted within each div.
[07:53:57] <Alex-xd> -3- I Like the Shit┌∩┐(◣_◢)┌∩┐
[07:55:56] <weaksauce> arthurvr I actually just got it working by using firefox. apparently chrome doesn't like File:// domain
[07:56:07] <weaksauce> thanks though
[07:56:37] <arthurvr> weaksauce: It will cause other problems in the future as well, but if it works, yay :)
[08:00:04] <DreamStiffler> anybody here?
[08:00:06] <weaksauce> oh yeah for sure. just a simple script that someone wrote and I was going to fix a little bit.
[08:00:06] <DreamStiffler> mahagurus?
[08:00:17] <weaksauce> not something that I am really working on in earnest
[08:00:22] <DreamStiffler> Cork? Uhkis? My saviors?
[08:00:23] <arthurvr> Hey DreadKnight

[08:18:11] <DreamStiffler> hi guys.. was hoping i could find some masters here. I have this http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/28/ . I am trying to get the returned data in to each existing div. Currently all 5 data goes into every div.
[08:18:28] <jonez> DreamStiffler, what's your question?
[08:18:53] <jonez> you said something earlier about populating some DIVs and what your plan was...
[08:18:53] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: Where did you asked this? My ZNC can’t find anything in past 24 hours :)
[08:19:14] <arthurvr> anyways let’s try to help you out
[08:20:39] <DreamStiffler> jonez: I have result that i retrieved. I need these results to be inserted into each existing DIV.
[08:21:04] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: [22:48] <DreamStiffler> hi.

[08:21:13] <arthurvr> yeah I see. sorry!
[08:21:38] <jonez> DreamStiffler, so your question is...
[08:21:41] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: and u say 24 hours? better fix that ZNC coz i was in earlier too.
[08:22:13] <arthurvr> yeah it was doing weird. That why it hadn’t found you :) Do you have a jsfiddle/jsbin?
[08:22:14] <DreamStiffler> jonez : i suck at coding. So how do i insert each returned array into each existing DIV
[08:22:44] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: yes sir http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/28/
[08:22:51] <arthurvr> thanks
[08:22:57] <jonez> give each div an id
[08:24:28] <DreamStiffler> jonez: i wold if i could. basically existing html are untouchable.
[08:24:58] <porkolt> hi
[08:25:06] <jonez> DreamStiffler, you may very well be up a creek then ;")
[08:25:39] <jonez> DreamStiffler, you need some way to reference the individual DIVs
[08:25:39] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: as u can see in my fiddle is that the all data is returned  into each div whereas i just need 1 in each. I tried a few but then again my coding sucks.
[08:25:54] <arthurvr> yeah I see
[08:27:08] <porkolt> How to add + 50px document?
[08:27:08] <porkolt> var doc = $(document).height();
[08:27:13] <porkolt> $("#div").css({"height" : doc});
[08:27:47] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: I’m fiddeling something for you
[08:29:56] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: thank you ir
[08:30:19] <DreamStiffler> *sir
[08:33:35] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: in a phone call. w8 few minutes :)
[08:33:47] <porkolt> var doc = $(document).height() +50; work, thanks, bb
[08:35:32] <Expel> Hello. How can I make my menu unclickable but the dropdown should be clickable?
[08:38:45] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: Really irritating. I can’t properly test it anymore since I’m running into the YQL api limit.
[08:39:05] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: Is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/py8hzsoo/1/
[08:40:20] <DreamStiffler> all hail arthurvr !
[08:40:29] <arthurvr> yay!
[08:40:47] <DreamStiffler> exactly. if i could ask a little bit more if you could add comments so i can understand what you did. im trying to learn as i go
[08:40:56] <arthurvr> Sure!
[08:41:14] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: believe it or not ive been stuck with this for 7 days. you have made a slave a free man today!
[08:41:24] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: and that shows how sucky i am
[08:41:30] <arthurvr> haha
[08:43:34] <DreamStiffler> never knew about eq before
[08:43:50] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: I’m adding some comments
[08:44:06] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: ok cool
[08:46:14] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: here you go
[08:46:15] <arthurvr> http://jsfiddle.net/py8hzsoo/3/
[08:46:42] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: Thank you bos
[08:46:48] <arthurvr> lol
[08:47:33] <atomicB0mb> i have a "display: none" class, and i SlideToggle it. does the display changes for block ?
[08:48:58] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: this is going to take me a while to digest, not very fammiliar with index too. the comments help a lot. again thank so much.
[08:49:22] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: Be sure to checkout the api docs and learn.jquery.com
[08:51:14] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: sure will do. do i need to know javascript first though?
[08:51:54] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: The answer is right on the front page, I wrote it there: http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/
[08:52:57] <DreamStiffler> arthurvr: ok hold on im comparing with my old code to see the difference firt
[08:53:32] <jonez> when I run that fiddle I get an error from the yahoo api about needing to use POST
[08:53:56] <arthurvr> yeah, I started getting errors after a while too. Guess it’s an api limit.
[08:54:11] <arthurvr> But it worked fine the first few times I ran it.
[08:54:23] <jonez> ah ok
[08:58:04] <DreadKnight> arthurvr, terrible hangover xD
[08:58:11] <arthurvr> yup
[08:58:11] <DreadKnight> late reply
[08:58:24] <arthurvr> pinged the wrong name :)
[08:58:32] <DreadKnight> hehe
[08:58:43] <DreadKnight> no worries
[08:58:49] <arthurvr> :-)
[08:59:34] <DreamStiffler> that api has a limit?
[09:00:02] <TheEternalAbyss> so I am wondering... I have a $(window).scroll() that result in giving my navigation a fixed position on scroll, so that the navigation is always visible. However, I have a modal I'm trying to build and it works, except that if any scrolling happens, the navigation container is visible (even though I hid it). I guess my question is this... how can I temporarily disable the $(window).scroll() when the modal is clicked?
[09:00:30] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: dunno. It worked the first 5/6 times and than stopped working, generally that’s something like that.
[09:00:47] <mooncup> can't you just give it a smaller z-index than the modal TheEternalAbyss?
[09:00:58] <TheEternalAbyss> i did... seems to not care
[09:00:58] <mooncup> also would fixed positon not be better than jquery for having it scroll with the screen?
[09:01:16] <TheEternalAbyss> i don't follow
[09:01:20] <jonez> DreamStiffler, convert it to a POST and see if it works again. seems odd that hitting a limit would result in that specific error.
[09:01:53] <TheEternalAbyss> oh you mean for the modal?
[09:02:21] <TheEternalAbyss> yea perhaps fixed would be better, but I want it to be mobile friendly and fixed... isn't that mobile friendly
[09:02:47] <TheEternalAbyss> i suppose on scroll I could check to see if my modal is active..
[09:03:06] <DreamStiffler> jonez: thatll be a while. it seems that the code earlier doest work well with mine. its displaying in first div 1 data, second div 2 data, third div 3 data, fourth div 4 data and fifth div 5 datas. Im currently looking into this
[09:03:14] <TheEternalAbyss> and if it is tell it to do nothing
[09:11:21] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm...
[09:11:42] <TheEternalAbyss> how odd.. I still get a weird white block above my modal..
[09:11:47] <TheEternalAbyss> peculiar
[09:23:59] <DreamStiffler> yeap this api sure is funny
[09:24:28] <arthurvr> DreamStiffler: Yes it is!
[09:34:06] <TheEternalAbyss> yea your right. fixed is the way to go it seems
[09:37:47] <MrStar> Hey guys o.o!
[09:38:37] <MrStar> Does someone know of a simple plugin to have a combobox-like box appear on a click, but which would contain custom ui elements?
[09:39:46] <MrStar> I would like to have a dropdown box, that would contain 2 sliders (minimum and maximum) and display its current state when closed.. I will probably end-up writing something like this myself if there is no such thing already o.o; does someone happen to know? Thanks!
[09:43:05] <jonez> MrStar, write your own. then you know it will do exactly what you need. then considering using an open source license and make a release.
[09:44:36] <MrStar> alright - thanks! will do
[09:50:13] <inthevidual> I'm working to build a basic flashcard app in jQuery and I've managed to come this far: http://jsfiddle.net/inthevidual/kLyxped4/ Now I'm wondering how to develop this further so as to make both sides of each card dynamic, i.e front with a question and back with an answer, instead of having a static flipside as I do now. Also, I would like to store questions and answers in an array, i.e.  [{q: question1 , a:answer1}, {q:question2,
[09:50:13] <inthevidual> a:answer2}...]. I would be very grateful if someone could assist me with this, thank you.
[09:58:16] <t1> any reason why you cant $('child').trigger('click') on an delegated event $('parent').on('click', 'child', somefunction) ?
[09:58:36] <t1> only found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12724147/how-do-i-manually-trigger-a-delegated-event-with-jquery
[09:58:52] <t1> but i don't anderstand the workaround that is suggested there -.-
[10:24:28] <NBhosting> how can i show a icon + message in the title bar when a user is on a other tab or not focussed on the website  icon+ text
[10:27:34] <Meir`> NBhosting, u mean "favicon"?
[10:27:49] <NBhosting> yeah favicon + title, but only if they not focussed on the website
[10:28:19] <Meir`> add some id to <link> tag of the favicon
[10:28:33] <Meir`> let's take "favicon" as example id
[10:28:58] <Meir`> then, you can change the "href" attribute of it dynamically
[10:29:06] <NBhosting> k
[10:29:20] <Meir`> $("#favicon").attr("href","other_favicon.ico");
[10:29:23] <Meir`> like this line
[10:29:23] <NBhosting> and seeing the difrance between background or not
[10:30:12] <Meir`> about the title, simply use: document.title = 'New Title';
[10:30:39] <Meir`> if you insist to stick with jquery, then: $(document).prop('title', 'New Title');
[10:31:35] <Meir`> NBhosting, i just realized you mean focus in the BROWSER tab
[10:31:42] <Meir`> i thought you mean UI tab
[10:33:21] <Meir`> NBhosting, i think you can use $(window).blur() and $(window).focus()
[10:34:28] <NBhosting> :D
[10:34:34] <NBhosting> ty i goan try some things
[10:46:43] <arthurvr> Hey guys!

[11:16:52] <ashg1910> I would like if I get some guidance at this level as I am new here.
[11:16:52] <ashg1910> Looking forward for a positive reply.

[11:23:29] <arthurvr> ashg1910: Hey!
[11:23:58] <ashg1910> @arthurvr: Hello! :)
[11:24:13] <arthurvr> ashg1910: I’m a jQuery team member, so can probably get you started. Is there anything specific you’d like to get involved with?
[11:25:09] <ashg1910> arthurvr: Just wanted to know where should I start?
[11:25:57] <arthurvr> ashg1910: Well, the thing is, where are you interested in working on? QUnit, jQuery core, jQuery UI, mobile, the css framework, …?
[11:27:56] <arthurvr> ashg1910: documentation maybe?
[11:28:16] <ashg1910> arthurvr: I have not decided as of now. It would be great if you could give me a brief about all these units and how can I contribute
[11:28:16] <ashg1910> Also I wanted to know the proposals list for GSOC'15
[11:29:26] <arthurvr> ashg1910: The list is at https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List. You can always find more info about the different projects on the websites.
[11:29:40] <arthurvr> ashg1910: Oh, btw, could we move this discussion over to #jquery-dev?
[11:30:02] <ashg1910> arthurvr: Okay!
[11:39:16] <arthurvr> ashg1910: also, be sure to checkout contribute.jquery.org
[11:43:00] <ashg1910> arthurvr: What about channels other than jquery-dev?
[11:43:39] <arthurvr> ashg1910: #jquery is meant for support questions

[12:11:05] <linux_daemon> hi guys, i have this: http://jsbin.com/mebaziyele/1/ . i cant figure out how to create session with jquery and send that session to the php file i have. i tried with $.session , but it doesnt work ... little help on that please?
[12:17:17] <Zeranoe> Is it possible to open a new page with a drag a drop? After the element has been dropped to an area, open a new page?
[12:17:46] <linux_daemon> Zeranoe: yes it is
[12:17:53] <arthurvr> Zeranoe: Sure it is!
[12:18:36] <int64> IS there some jquery plugin that will make format a list of images to fit togethe rnicely, similar to tumbler and instagram?
[12:19:04] <linux_daemon> anyone ever worked similarly to my case in the jsbin i provided? i just wanna create session in the ajax success, and redirect and send the session along.
[12:19:37] <Zeranoe> Are there any examples of that? The big picture: I have several elements that can be dragged and dropped into different sections on the page. The drop event will open a new page with the element id and the section it was dropped to as an argument, and the page will run a query to update a database reflecting that.
[12:20:29] <linux_daemon> show us a jsbin please
[12:32:21] <linux_daemon> anyone on my problem?
[13:02:46] <Azrael_-> hi
[13:03:07] <Azrael_-> i've got a list of articles. the user can add the articles from a popup and then select how many he wants. if a user edits the list lateron, should i generate the already selected list with js or with code-behind?
[13:07:51] <linux_daemon> generate the already selected list with js
[13:08:12] <Azrael_-> hmm, ok
[13:08:24] <Azrael_-> any arguments/pro/cons?
[13:26:07] <wwwroth> Is it safe to ask for help solving a bug in here?
[13:27:25] <sacho_> possibly
[13:27:37] <Azrael_-> wwwroth: yes if you drill it down to a small question
[13:29:05] <t1> wwwroth, no: http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/459/Sys32.gif
[13:29:29] <wwwroth> I'm building a Chrome extension and trying to programmatically enter a recipient into a Gmail composed email. Unfortunately it's not as simple as setting the value because a lot of the DOM changes. I analyzed what changes and modified it with jQuery but when you hit send it still yells at me to enter a recipient.  https://gist.github.com/wwwroth/e3a5712af737c3fa4e65 Not a simple question but I've been stumped for about five hours :(
[13:30:43] <wwwroth> t1, people still use Windows?
