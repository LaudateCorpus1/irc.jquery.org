[00:19:21] <yanchai> hi
[03:15:04] <madprops> is there a nice way to recreate an element?
[03:33:54] <Cork> madprops: recreat what?
[03:34:04] <Cork> if you have the content you can create the element
[03:34:16] <Cork> but there ins't a history of old elements in the page if that is what you mean
[03:34:24] <Cork> *isn't*
[03:38:50] <sine0> morning fruitloops
[03:39:10] <madprops> Cork, what i ended up doing was el.replaceWith(somehtml)
[03:39:18] <madprops> since the somehtml is basic and predictable
[03:39:32] <Cork> madprops: be carefull with what you html you feed it
[03:39:38] <madprops> just small strings
[03:39:42] <Cork> as that runs through full html parsing so it can give you xss
[03:39:56] <Cork> (it is normally better to create an element and give it the content instead)
[03:39:56] <madprops> btw are operations like that "expensive" ?
[03:40:01] <Cork> no
[03:40:06] <Cork> but it is risky
[03:40:14] <madprops> there's no user submitted html in there
[03:40:26] <madprops> https://paste.merkoba.com/1551429626-cisuhi-1
[03:40:31] <Cork> no user submitted contant at all you mean i hope?
[03:41:50] <madprops> well at least not in that function
[03:42:27] <Cork> if "id" is static or from none user content your safe
[03:42:31] <Cork> else you have xss problem
[03:42:56] <Cork> i would write that as $('<div>', { id: id, class: 'media_container' }) instead
[03:43:03] <Cork> as it is free of xss risk
[03:43:21] <Cork> (and actually cleaner to read)
[03:43:23] <madprops> let id = $(this).attr("id")
[03:43:49] <madprops> no risk, unless something changed the element id
[03:43:59] <madprops> but that would be nasty
[03:44:40] <Cork> ya, but html parsing when you don't need it is something better avoided, as one have to trace all data to the source to make sure it is safe
[03:47:06] <madprops> noted
[05:57:52] <Deusdeorum> Im trying to make a decrementing clock when a user starts writing something in an input and i have been trying for a while now, I cannot figure out why the clock restarts all the time? https://jsfiddle.net/0fpbm6y2/1/
[06:37:29] <sine0> I have a loading screen that was on document.ready and then I changed it to window.load which worked for me, however the inner jquery had some masonry, and even though the images loaded there is still a delay with how the masonry pulls all the images into place, should I put a small delay after window.load just to cover this
[06:37:57] <sine0> is there a further stage after window.load
[07:15:09] <Cork> Dessimat0r: you need to store a reference for the timer outside the function and if it is set don't do anything
[07:15:29] <Cork> Deusdeorum: one doesn't only call the function once, but once per element
[07:21:54] <Cork> Deusdeorum: https://jsfiddle.net/b6w3kvoh/1/
[07:22:37] <Cork> sine0: masonry has a callback when it has done its layout
[07:22:55] <Cork> also it normally has an animation for the layout if i remember correctly
[07:23:08] <Cork> (haven't used it in a few years)
[07:28:45] <Deusdeorum> thanks Cork
[07:28:47] <Deusdeorum> I see now
[11:38:03] <ZeroWalker> is it possible to run scripts like you do in a browser, but instead via your webpage, to grab data from other pages etc?
[11:38:23] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:38:35] <robertmaxrees> you mean can you scrape data from other pages?
[11:39:56] <ZeroWalker> if that's what it's called, yeah. Not sure how to get to the point where you can run javascript on the other page (or a copy of it) to do that, as it's kinda automatic on the browser
[11:40:23] <robertmaxrees> could you explain a little more about why you want to do that??
[11:40:28] <ZeroWalker> script being the way to extract the data
[11:40:43] <robertmaxrees> since that informs quite a bit of your options.
[11:40:43] <ZeroWalker> well it's basically to grab a list of links so i don't have to copy paste
[11:40:57] <robertmaxrees> do you'
[11:41:17] <robertmaxrees> *so you're not trying to take data and store it for a db of kind?
[11:41:29] <robertmaxrees> just for personal convenience's sake?
[11:42:12] <ZeroWalker> not storing in a db, but yeah it's just for personal sake, and save some time
[11:42:56] <robertmaxrees> you could use something like tampermonkey/greasemonkey
[11:43:05] <ZeroWalker> i just need to get how one gets to the point where you can actually search through the html (preferebly with javascript)
[11:43:20] <ZeroWalker> thought that was for browsers only?
[11:43:23] <robertmaxrees> are you on the other page when this happens?
[11:43:33] <robertmaxrees> or are you looking for a command line option of some kind?
[11:44:08] <ZeroWalker> well either works, i am doing it on another private hosted site, cause i thought it would simplify things (being the same enviroment and all)
[11:44:26] <ZeroWalker> but C# would work just as well
[11:44:39] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm unclear about what you want to build then :)
[11:44:54] <robertmaxrees> scraping a page is very easy with node and python.
[11:45:02] <robertmaxrees> and a host of other languages/platforms
[11:45:16] <robertmaxrees> i'd pick whatever you're most comfortable with and go with that.
[11:45:24] <ZeroWalker> well i just need to grab the page, then be able to do searchs on the elements and the like.
[11:45:50] <robertmaxrees> if you want something command-line based, i'd go with node or python.
[11:46:11] <ZeroWalker> i just don't get how to get to that point, if you can actually just grab and load the page internally, or if you have to do some fancy stuff
[11:46:54] <ZeroWalker> yeah was thinking of node
[11:47:15] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5801453/in-node-js-express-how-do-i-download-a-page-and-gets-its-html
[11:47:20] <robertmaxrees> very simple
[11:48:09] <ZeroWalker> oh, let's see!

[11:48:38] <robertmaxrees> etc
[12:09:31] <djbozzz> Hi all -- having trouble trying to grasp this error that is occurring on a synthetic type event.... I have a checkbox when clicked hides several input boxes and removes their value... Most of these input boxes are already hidden(not removed but display:none;). One of the boxes is shown, i remove it and then call a synthetic event trigger('keyup').... when this occurs I get a 'Cannot convert undefined or null to object' error
[12:09:31] <djbozzz>  .... but I can call a 'click' and all the other elements that are already hidden when I call the synthetic event on them i do not get an error(i'm using the .each() iterator to iterate over elements that have a similar ending classname)
[12:09:40] <robertmaxrees> yikes that's a wall
[12:10:08] <robertmaxrees> can you show us the code?
[12:10:43] <djbozzz> Ha sorry!
[12:16:39] <djbozzz> Trying to replicate it... but can't for some reason
[12:16:40] <djbozzz> https://jsbin.com/lanuliyoka/edit?html,js,console,output
[12:17:10] <djbozzz> So, my local code will output the element like the above example does, but when triggering that keyup event it then tosses the "Cannot convert undefined or null to object"
[12:17:42] <robertmaxrees> where's the button?
[12:19:07] <djbozzz> I added a "test" button to just see why the synthetic event was throwing that
[12:19:32] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/Z039jYg.png ?
[12:19:34] <djbozzz> In my actual application its based off an input keyup event(but having some test button fire a keyup tirgger does the same
[12:20:09] <djbozzz> https://jsbin.com/nomuvetalo/edit?html,js,console,output
[12:20:12] <djbozzz> Weird
[12:20:19] <djbozzz> Ha sorry
[12:20:51] <robertmaxrees> are yopu using any other plugins or libraries or anything?
[12:21:13] <djbozzz> The interesting thing is: I have multiple inputs that are fired via event delegation ... they are all the exact same tree structure ... yet this one element is the only thing that causes issues
[12:21:16] <djbozzz> Nope
[12:21:29] <robertmaxrees> can you share the actual code then?
[12:21:42] <robertmaxrees> also: what version of jquery?
[12:21:47] <djbozzz> I'm building a list of inputs dynamically... which is the tough part
[12:21:59] <djbozzz> 3.3.1
[12:22:06] <robertmaxrees> why is that "tough"?
[12:22:42] <djbozzz> all inputs rendered dynamically based on DB
[12:22:43] <robertmaxrees> it's apparent that you're passing null or undefined somewhere.
[12:22:45] <djbozzz> values in DB
[12:22:56] <robertmaxrees> so without more context it's hard to help./
[12:23:04] <djbozzz> Yeah totally get it!
[12:23:09] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:23:20] <robertmaxrees> even just seeing the js and related marketup would be nice.
[12:23:29] <robertmaxrees> doesn't necessarily have to function
[12:27:49] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: Found my issue... I had some event delegation setup on only that node based on an ID... which had null being passed...
[12:28:01] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:28:04] <robertmaxrees> there you go
[12:28:08] <djbozzz> I had a bunch of dynamic fields that were all the same and that was the only one...
[12:28:22] <djbozzz> So mind boggling... ha
[12:28:26] <djbozzz> Sorry, and thanks!
[12:29:32] <djbozzz> Side question, when you are coming up with a solution ... do you aggregate all of your event delegators / event listeners in a single component? Or do you try to create components that contain event delegators / listeners and then perform business logic?
[12:30:30] <robertmaxrees> back up lol
[12:31:09] <robertmaxrees> what does that first sentence have to do with anything?
[12:31:12] <djbozzz> Ha sorry -- just found JS to be hard to manage
[12:31:31] <robertmaxrees> second of all - if i have a lot of componentization, i use a library or framework to handle that for me.
[12:32:02] <robertmaxrees> and why are you distinguishing between "event delegators" and "event listeners"?
[12:32:03] <djbozzz> By components I just mean structuring it in logical modules
[12:32:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, each component should be as self-contained and isolated as possible.
[12:32:23] <robertmaxrees> imo
[12:32:39] <djbozzz> Event listeners occur on dom elements that exist and event delegators are bubbling up events that are placed on an item that exists(i.e., a ul but listens to a li event but li might not always eist)
[12:32:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:33:01] <robertmaxrees> those are both listeners.
[12:33:02] <djbozzz> Or am I totally incorrect?
[12:33:30] <robertmaxrees> there's really nothing different between them.
[12:33:58] <djbozzz> Ok
[12:34:44] <djbozzz> Framework / library wise, what do you use when you have a large app with multiple components? Besides React/Vue/Angular
[12:35:04] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:35:07] <robertmaxrees> why not react?
[12:36:29] <djbozzz> Since loading HTML via DB -- cant use React since HTML loading via http reqs on the fly. No way to add to VDOM -- so wont be in Reacts render tree
[12:36:37] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:36:37] <djbozzz> Hence using raw jQuery
[12:36:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:36:53] <robertmaxrees> literally nothing you said precludes you from being able to use react.
[12:37:13] <robertmaxrees> unless you're not able to un-break your backed to not ship markup like thjat.
[12:37:14] <robertmaxrees> *that
[12:37:23] <djbozzz> I'm loading a bunch of HTML that I've escaped and saved in a database. Based on users inputs I unescape and load that HTML into DOM. I don't know how I would be able to load that into Reacts VDOM safely and display and then edit accordingly
[12:37:27] <robertmaxrees> :|
[12:37:33] <robertmaxrees> that's a really scary setup
[12:37:35] <robertmaxrees> but okay
[12:37:51] <robertmaxrees> backbone might be an option for your case.
[12:38:08] <robertmaxrees> but i'd question that architecture.  storing markup in a db is a really bad practice.
[12:38:28] <djbozzz> Creating some that generates and fills out newsletters -- we create an editor / inputs on the fly (not WYSWIG just simplistic elements) and we have multiple templates that have multiple different inputs and elements they target in HTML.
[12:38:34] <djbozzz> How would you do it?
[12:39:03] <djbozzz> Or what would you recommend, rather?
[12:39:23] <robertmaxrees> we do something similar - we have an in-house cms.  users input text into fields to denote titles, sections, paragraphs, etc, and we then store that as JSON, but not tied to any markup structure.
[12:39:38] <robertmaxrees> they simply pick a template, and we pass the JSON through it to generate the content.
[12:40:21] <robertmaxrees> dbs are bad for storing html.
[12:42:42] <djbozzz> One of the issues we've been having is sometimes a template only wants a single paragraph not to -- but a template can be limited to 5 paragraphs ... so we were creating HTML components and saving them then when a checkbox was turned on or off that html component was inserted based on an ID
[12:43:01] <djbozzz> How would you save those components then(i.e., custom HTML with inline style)
[12:43:23] <robertmaxrees> save what components?
[12:43:28] <robertmaxrees> you don't save html.
[12:43:28] <djbozzz> --- I'm not a frontend person what so ever ha and prev developer implemented this solution awhile ago
[12:43:37] <robertmaxrees> you save the JSON
[12:43:42] <robertmaxrees> and then render on-demand as needed.
[12:44:08] <djbozzz> When you say JSON, are you saving values that are inserted into HTML or escaping and saving HTML as JSON encoded
[12:44:18] <robertmaxrees> neither
[12:45:29] <robertmaxrees> you save JUST the data - you denote semantic things like headings, paragraphs, emphasized text, etc.
[12:45:36] <robertmaxrees> but that's semantic meaning, not html.
[12:45:54] <robertmaxrees> you then use your templating engine to handle rendering that into html.
[12:46:23] <djbozzz> Ah I got it now: {type: "div" content: "test", children: {}}
[12:46:36] <robertmaxrees> except never "div"
[12:46:41] <djbozzz> table* lol.
[12:46:46] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[12:46:49] <robertmaxrees> maybe "tabular"
[12:47:02] <robertmaxrees> but the JSON contains nothing about what the html should be.
[12:47:19] <robertmaxrees> because the data should be handled as distinct from the markup.
[12:49:06] <djbozzz> Our templates have markup "components" about them(i.e., Sponsor1 and HTML component associated with that Sponsor) if we turn on that sponsor that component will be injected in and you can fill it out. How do you handle those distinct components?
[12:49:24] <robertmaxrees> they're just inputs.
[12:50:12] <robertmaxrees> none of what you've said requires that you store html in a db :)
[12:50:23] <robertmaxrees> it's all good though.  it's a major architectural shift.
[13:06:18] <djbozzz> The issue is when someoen wants to change some html of a component associated with a field in the editor
[13:06:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the idea is that nobody should never be editing html
[13:07:34] <djbozzz> ha one of hte issues is our production team likes to update them all the time
[13:08:57] <robertmaxrees> sounds like they need to be updating templates and not the data itself.
[13:09:48] <djbozzz> Yeah exactly! Which is why I was saving it -- because IWas breaking each template into components to be injected
[13:09:59] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:10:13] <robertmaxrees> except the tempaltes aren't apart of the actual data.
[13:20:47] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: Yeah, but user should be able to edit the template modules/components(i.e. ,a table in the HTML) that can be injected if its turned on or off
[13:20:53] <robertmaxrees> newp
[13:21:01] <robertmaxrees> templates should be separate from data.
[13:21:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:21:18] <djbozzz> Yeah I'm not saving hardcoded html with values
[13:21:33] <djbozzz> and components aren't data they are raw html that can be turned on in a template or not
[13:22:17] <robertmaxrees> something sounds weird about that but okie :)
[13:22:43] <djbozzz> ha im probably just not understanding and need another cup of coffee
[13:22:51] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[14:52:31] <Simplar> Greetings! Why does my code stop executing after myObject.html('new code') is placed?
[15:43:04] <znf> Simplar, voodoo
[15:43:08] <znf> (post a fiddle)
[15:43:31] <Simplar> https://jsfiddle.net/yr4685qx/
[15:43:35] <Simplar> Something else
[15:43:58] <Simplar> how to select the new option in <select>?
[15:43:59] <Simplar> like in fiddle
[15:48:29] <znf> you can just do $('select').val('your selected option')
[15:50:52] <Simplar> Huh?
[15:51:05] <Simplar> and what if I want to do it by index?
[15:51:09] <Simplar> by 'selectedIndex'
[15:51:23] <Simplar> I simply get a name of it?
[15:54:13] <Simplar> znf: https://jsfiddle.net/yr4685qx/1/
[15:54:15] <Simplar> does not work
[15:55:16] <znf> I didn't say to do it on option
[15:55:36] <znf> $('#mySelect').val(2)
[15:56:13] <Simplar> but hey
[15:56:21] <Simplar> i know the index of the option
[15:56:23] <Simplar> not its value
[15:56:32] <Simplar> and i want to set the value to option three
[15:56:34] <Simplar> (index 2)
[15:56:42] <Simplar> how can i do it with .val?
[15:58:42] <znf> then add selected to it instead
[15:59:13] <Simplar> .attr('selected')?
[16:01:29] <Simplar> https://jsfiddle.net/yr4685qx/2/
[16:01:31] <Simplar> does not work
[16:01:42] <znf> $('select option:nth-child(4)').prop('selected', true)
[16:01:46] <Simplar> oh
[16:01:48] <Simplar> yeah
[16:01:49] <Simplar> fixed
[16:02:42] <Simplar> necessary_select.find("option").eq(2).attr('selected','selected');
[16:02:45] <Simplar> like this?
[16:03:51] <znf> that works too, sure
[16:18:34] <Simplar> lol
[20:16:30] <znf> How would I avoid doing something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/4581n30e/ - can I do them all in one sweep?
[20:17:23] <znf> like, let fields = ['#one', '#two', '#tree']; fields.prop('required', true) or something?
[20:39:19] <znf> ignore that, I completely forgot you can list multiple selector with a comma
[21:35:02] <ptya> im trying to sort a array based on alphabetic order, but now i want to add when region equals to be first in array but somehow it puts some matches between the array here my code
[21:35:04] <ptya> https://pastebin.com/raw/eVLnH7Dh
[21:56:09] <shoky> ptya: because you're only checking `a` , and not `b`
[21:56:26] <shoky> b can have that region too
[21:56:40] <shoky> in which case you want to return positive
[21:57:57] <ptya> shoky: whats the best way to do this, because whenever i use return a[type] > b[type] ? 1 : a[type] < b[type] ? -1 : 0 this works correctly but now i want to put based on the region the region on top
[21:57:59] <shoky> (btw doesn't matter the actual number you return, -1 or -2 are same)
[21:58:38] <shoky> ptya: like i said, you're only checking a.  so check b too.    if (a['region'] === ...) { return -1 } else if (b['region'] === ...) { return 1 }
[21:59:41] <ptya> shoky: i also tried if (a[type] === region.region) {                     return -1                 }                 if (b[type] === region.region) {                     return 1                 }
[21:59:55] <ptya> shoky: this one is putting the one based on region above but it seperates the others
[22:00:25] <shoky> ptya: what do you mean separates the others?  you need to leave the previous check you had, at the end
[22:02:15] <ptya> For example i have region 3 times Texas, California 5 times and New York 10 times, what i want is to bring the 10 New york above California and want to keep California together without having texas between California
[22:03:06] <ptya> shoky: what it does now i bring the 10 New York above California but mixes Texas and California
[22:03:15] <shoky> uhh
[22:03:17] <shoky> don't talk in states
[22:03:19] <shoky> talk in numbers
[22:03:24] <shoky> i'm confused
[22:03:57] <shoky> ptya: https://jsfiddle.net/Lux6y8s2/  not what you wanetd?
[22:04:12] <shoky> 3 at the beginning, the rest are sorted
[22:05:43] <ptya> shoky: that confuses me for example array is this ["Texas", Texas", "California", "Texas", "New York", "California", "Texas", "New York", "New York", "California"] must be
[22:06:21] <ptya> ["New York", New York", "New York", "California", "California", "California", "Texas", "Texas", "Texas", "Texas"]
[22:06:39] <shoky> alphabetical sort ?
[22:07:10] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to sort by time zone then by alpha?
[22:07:44] <ptya> shoky: yes alphabetic only whenever i have let region = "New York" than New York must be the first array
[22:07:50] <ptya> rest must be alphabetic again
[22:08:24] <ptya> shoky: whenever i have let region = "Texas" than output must be like Texas, California, New York
[22:09:00] <shoky> ptya: nothing changes:  https://jsfiddle.net/Lux6y8s2/1/
[22:09:20] <shoky> ptya: though to be safe you should use .localeCompare to compare strings,  not > and <
[22:10:12] <shoky> (for that you'd just:  return a[type].localeCompare(b[type])   for the alphabetic type case)
[22:11:23] <ptya> shoky: wow the fiddle did work for me :o
[22:12:08] <ptya> shoky: is it because i used if instead of else if ?
[22:12:33] <shoky> nope. donno
[22:13:41] <ptya> mja anyway it works shoky  thanks alot i took my 5 hours :O
[22:13:59] <shoky> sure
