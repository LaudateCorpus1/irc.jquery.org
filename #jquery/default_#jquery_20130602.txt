[00:02:48] <Rinthe> anyone?
[00:05:02] <meowcat> headers: {}
[00:07:15] <Titas9x> Lots of duplicates in this script. How I refractor this?  https://gist.github.com/titas9x/5692864
[00:15:47] <Schonert> this might not be the right place to ask, but i don't know where to look. Can i embed a vimeo vid, so that the loads don't show up under "stats" from my develpment area?
[00:15:54] <redstubble_> Noob so please be gentle. I am trying to target div with child 'field' and edit the css. I have got this but its not working? . Five years later I chanced to spend three days with a ranger in a tiny izba, a traditional Russian log cabin, on the eastern shore of the lake. At night we sipped vodka and played chess; during the day I helped him haul in his fishing nets. We hardly spoke, but we read a lot. That was when I promised mys
[00:18:00] <redstubble_> Sorry wrong paste ha ha $("div.video").hasClass("field").css("height","200px")
[00:18:18] <redstubble_> Is this the wrong syntax?
[00:23:03] <systemfault> Well.. sure it's wrong...
[00:23:10] <monk3y> redstubble_: by "div with child 'field'", do you mean a div with a 'field' child-element .. or div with *class* "field"?
[00:23:19] <systemfault> What do you think that .hasClass() returns..
[00:23:31] <systemfault> Good luck calling .css on a boolean
[00:23:56] <monk3y> Ah, redstubble_: were you thinking that hasClass([class]) would just return a subset of elements with that class?
[00:24:41] <redstubble_> As I said still trying to learn the proper syntax. I wanted to add css to the div.video with the child div.field
[00:24:52] <monk3y> Riiiiiiiiight
[00:25:12] <redstubble_> I was thinking that hasClass was the best way of targeting a an element with specific children
[00:25:24] <monk3y> redstubble_: $('div.video > div.field').css(..) .. I think.
[00:25:54] <monk3y> Just let the CSS selector do all the selecting, as it were.
[00:25:58] <redstubble_> Oh right I dodn't know it would be exactly the same as CSS
[00:27:29] <redstubble_> monk3y: Bingo, thanks I have been on that for an hour. Cheers mate
[00:33:24] <Rinthe> I have <div #overlay><div #post></div></div>. And have $(document).on('click', '#overlay', function() { close/hide both #over and #post } the problem is when i click on the contents of #post, it will close everytyhing. Is there a way to prevent this?
[00:34:39] <systemfault> The easy hack is to stop the propagation of click events when they reach the #post element
[00:35:12] <systemfault> $(document).on('click', '#post', function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); })
[00:41:16] <Rinthe> systemfault: why do you say its a hack?
[01:19:18] <anew> cant remember, but what is the other thing besides append
[01:19:26] <anew> i need to insert html inside an already existing div
[01:22:07] <monk3y> anew: as in, the div is empty, and you're completely refilling it for this/every call?
[01:22:17] <monk3y> anew: you don't mean .html()?
[01:22:32] <anew> yeah think i can use html()
[01:22:50] <monk3y> Ok.  As long as you don't care to clobber whatever else is in there.
[01:22:57] <anew> what do u mean clobber
[01:24:15] <monk3y> Well as in, if anything else is in the Div when you .html() it, I think it'll overwrite whatever's in there.  Hence; clobbering, smashing, trampling, overwriting, etc.
[01:25:46] <anew> will just use .append() dont want to use underscore only have to do it one or so times

[02:19:01] <Maffelu> If I'm using animate on all divs (such as  $('div').animate(...)) and have a callback then that callback will be run for all the divs. Is there a standard for how to run something after all the callbacks has been run?
[02:26:13] <Maffelu> Nevermind, I just read up on promises!
[02:31:48] <ThoMe> hiho
[02:31:57] <ThoMe> can anyone help me with "X-editable" ?
[02:44:18] <Rinthe> when im in a multiple if statements. certain conditions are met, how do i tell it to just carry on and leave this part if statement
[03:26:09] <ThoMe> hello?

[04:08:26] <fraxture> hi all, i'm trying to use jquery to direct a scroll event on one element to another, i.e. when someone use s the mouse wheel over elementA it scrolls elementB. here is a code pen… as you can see it's not working, but i can't quite reckon why. http://codepen.io/ezmiller/pen/xqtjs
[04:10:29] <fraxture> oooop never mind i just figured out what i was doing wrong.
[04:26:34] <ryorky1> how would I access the following json in an ajax response?
[04:26:41] <ryorky1> {"folder_replace":"1","status":200}
[04:38:42] <dokma> When I load some code via ajax that contains <script> and append it to the document with .append the scripts are not parsed.
[04:38:49] <dokma> What else do I need to do?
[04:46:09] <rosieres> dokma you have to strip out the inline js with you ajax function and pass it to the DOM . .
[04:46:47] <rosieres> dokma the success handler should then do the rest
[04:47:14] <dokma> rosieres any examples on how this is done? I also probably need to make sure I don't pass same scripts twice?
[04:47:42] <rosieres> dokma I have no time for this . . . take the google
[04:47:56] <dokma> thank you
[04:47:56] <rosieres> you got the concept
[05:14:37] <kleinerdrache> hi there
[05:15:13] <kleinerdrache> can i make the mouse look like its over an <a> element when its somewhere else, where i want to implement a 'clicked' binding ??
[05:36:02] <Kambfhase> I'm having some spare ADN invites, anyone want one? https://join.app.net/p/vnftbmtjlh
[06:15:43] <_Cody> What is the correct mousehandler to make a simple onmousover effect: http://jsfiddle.net/JW64v/
[06:16:38] <_Cody> I need another event handler there
[06:18:51] <verism> http://jsfiddle.net/JW64v/1/
[06:19:14] <verism> @_Cody it's mouseover your syntax was wrong
[06:19:27] <_Cody> ah thats why mouseover fails!
[06:19:28] <verism> use a comma
[06:19:46] <verism> a colon (:) is if you're using a css object
[06:20:00] <_Cody> u are right i need event delegation
[06:20:23] <_Cody> still doesn't do what I'd like, but thx for the improvement
[06:28:28] <JohnnyCache> if i use .remove() do i have to use .empty() before?
[06:30:42] <verism> try it out and see
[06:52:27] <_Cody> still ask myself how i could achieve this text-mouseover color change. someone with tutorial link here?http://jsfiddle.net/JW64v/
[07:03:47] <_Cody> http://jsfiddle.net/JW64v/3/
[07:14:43] <BillCriswell> _Cody: You mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/JW64v/6/
[07:15:26] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/JW64v/8/ Might be more what you're going for
[07:16:26] <_Cody> I am justt looking for the correct selector for (text that is selected with mouse) with that I had succeess
[07:16:40] <_Cody> u see currently i have selected page>div, div or whatever
[07:16:59] <_Cody> How can I select any text under my mouse? I give u a link that shows what i want:
[07:17:23] <_Cody> http://matthiasschuetz.com/firebug-cheatsheet-mit-shortcuts-und-befehlen
[07:17:23] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[07:17:26] <_Cody> text goes green here
[07:17:45] <_Cody> this is exactly what I want. But how to tell jquery: select all text where my mouse is over?
[07:18:30] <_Cody> this selection needs to get this class somehow for it to work. currently i only select divs that already exist (which obviously fails
[07:18:34] <_Cody> )
[07:18:44] <BillCriswell> _Cody: I think you just want <a href="#">Firebug-Cheatsheet</a> and to use CSS like a:hover { background-color: #0f0; color: #fff; }
[07:19:16] <_Cody> no i want for all text
[07:19:21] <_Cody> :hover does not work there
[07:19:29] <_Cody> u see on page i gave u ?
[07:19:55] <_Cody> all text is given this green background color when u mouseover it
[07:20:04] <_Cody> not only h , p or a element
[07:20:45] <BillCriswell> I must be missing something.
[07:21:01] <_Cody> BillCriswell: ok i give u screen how it looks on me
[07:21:27] <BillCriswell> _Cody: http://jsfiddle.net/JW64v/10/ this?
[07:22:05] <_Cody> no i want new class to new html element…
[07:22:10] <verism> _Cody: take a look at the CSS on that site - that's causing the changes, not javascript
[07:22:16] <_Cody> ok here is screen
[07:22:18] <_Cody> i know
[07:22:28] <_Cody> with js i want to insert css class and html probably
[07:23:03] <_Cody> http://imagebin.org/259944
[07:23:09] <_Cody> the selection has special color
[07:23:14] <_Cody> this is exactly what i want
[07:24:10] <BillCriswell> _Cody: ::selection { background-color: red; } ?
[07:24:31] <_Cody> tell me more!!!
[07:24:31] <verism> like this? : http://css-tricks.com/examples/DifferentSelectionColors/
[07:24:46] <_Cody> wow, possible with css3? I am most interested
[07:24:50] <anew> how to get a uri segment with jquery? i.e. if i have site.com/segment, how can get 'segment'
[07:25:09] <_Cody> verism: BillCriswell thank you so much!
[07:25:23] <_Cody> {but why on earth is this text color change in jqery ui???}
[07:25:38] <_Cody> {if its possible with css also :| }
[07:25:56] <BillCriswell> anew: location.href.split('/').slice(3)[0]
[07:26:05] <anew> damn that's ugly
[07:26:12] <anew> thx
[07:26:12] <verism> i guess it makes it slightly easier to code - so you're not using vendor prefixes?
[07:26:27] <BillCriswell> Er, location.pathname will work too.
[07:26:30] <BillCriswell> couldn't think of the name haha
[07:26:34] <lorenz_> Anyone know how to force execute all running timers in the dotimeout plugin?
[07:27:10] <BillCriswell> location.pathname.substr(1) if you don't want the /
[07:27:12] <lorenz_> ben_alman: ping ^
[07:27:16] <_Cody> verism: BillCriswell thx for training noob on css. Without u i had lost couple of hours more in search of solution.
[07:27:52] <BillCriswell> _Cody: I'm just glad verism knew what you were actually trying to do lol
[07:28:04] <verism> no prob - feels good to be the one actualy giving help for once
[07:28:31] <lorenz_> ben_alman: how to force execute all running timers in the dotimeout plugin?
[07:28:41] <BillCriswell> anew: location.pathname works as well.
[07:28:50] <BillCriswell> Forgot to mention your nick earlier.
[07:29:04] <BillCriswell> I just couldn't think of "pathname" for whatever reason
[07:29:30] <verism> is that specific to the first forward slash?
[07:30:20] <BillCriswell> verism: Think it'll return whatever is after the domain and before the query string ( or hash )
[07:30:38] <BillCriswell> Think the query string is location.search in javascript.
[07:30:48] <verism> nice - good to know
[07:31:02] <ThoMe> emm.
[07:31:14] <ThoMe> is x-editable in using? :-)

[07:34:50] <ThoMe> Kambfhase: benutzt du das ding?
[07:35:00] <Kambfhase> welches?
[07:35:09] <ThoMe> "x-editable" ?
[07:35:13] <Kambfhase> nö
[07:35:26] <ThoMe> mh. ok
[07:35:41] <Renkineko1> hi everyone :)
[07:36:20] <Kambfhase> Das ist auch mal ein bescheuerter Name.
[07:36:37] <Renkineko1> I'm a little perplex... I'm trying to send a post ajax request via jquery, and one of them is not working... My response is good (I have xml in the response and everything), but the success function don't seem to be triggered...
[07:36:40] <anew> ah thx bill
[07:36:48] <Kambfhase> ?p @ Renkineko1
[07:36:49] <bot-t> Renkineko1, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:40:12] <Guest92075> http://jsfiddle.net/x3VdG/2/
[07:42:10] <Renkineko> I tried doing $.post and $.ajax, and even the $.ajax().done(function()) didn't work... I'm a little lost
[07:42:33] <Renkineko> (I repost the link with the good nickname ^^) : http://jsfiddle.net/x3VdG/2/
[07:43:05] <Kambfhase> You could try adding an error handler and see what has gone wrong.
[07:45:15] <Renkineko> yeah but if there was error, shouldn't I get other things in the response of the request ? Because here, my request's response is completely ok :o
[07:46:33] <Renkineko> it's a 200 status code, the response/preview is also good... I will try to do a error handler but I'm pretty sure it's worthless :p
[07:46:58] <BillCriswell>  Renkineko: What type of data are you expecting to be returned?
[07:47:10] <Renkineko> xml
[07:47:22] <Kambfhase> Well, if you get back XMl it might look OK to you but jQ might have trouble pasring it
[07:47:38] <Renkineko> mmmmmmmmh... Sounds familiar indeed
[07:48:00] <rue> And the type needs to match, anyway
[07:48:21] <rue> Probably the dumbest feature of $.ajax is that it can fail with 200 with /no/ indication what went wrong
[07:48:37] <rue> Like is ‘wrong datatype’, or ‘error parsing JSON’ too hard to include in the message?
[07:48:59] <BillCriswell> rue: It is a little weird that it can't let you know.
[07:50:06] <BillCriswell> Renkineko: Just make sure the server is sending XML content-types. If it's not I think you can send a 4th argument to $.get of 'xml'.
[07:51:50] <Renkineko> yeah the server is sending XML content-types, and indeed the error handler is called, so... I have to find where the error is...
[07:52:07] <Renkineko> I removed all accents just in case, but there's still error... :)
[07:52:41] <BillCriswell> Renkineko: Can you try setting the data type to html and seeing if it you can log that?
[07:53:23] <Renkineko> ... I think I found what's going wrong... Just wait 2s :p
[07:54:20] <Renkineko> aaaaaaaaaaand I was wrong, didn't find... I'll test the html thing...
[07:56:45] <Renkineko> I don't understand the error log
[07:56:55] <Renkineko> but it seems to be the same as with xml contents
[07:58:56] <rue> Do you have both contentType and dataType set?
[08:00:16] <Renkineko> I just set dataType
[08:00:45] <Renkineko> (with the $.ajax() method, with the $.post I didn't set any type ^^)
[08:00:46] <BillCriswell> Does it fail with xml set as well?
[08:01:05] <Renkineko> don't understand... xml set where ? @_@
[08:02:12] <BillCriswell> set as the data type.
[08:03:03] <Renkineko> I will update my paste to let your know how I set the $.ajax
[08:03:32] <BillCriswell> Renkineko: You can do $.post( url, data, suceess, dataType ) with post as well.
[08:04:02] <Renkineko> http://jsfiddle.net/x3VdG/4/
[08:04:11] <Renkineko> yes I know, but I don't know how to handle the error with the method $.post ^^
[08:05:09] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[08:06:08] <Renkineko> so I have an error (the textStatus of the error is "parsererror"), but I still don't know why there's an error
[08:06:51] <BillCriswell> Renkineko: Oh.
[08:07:18] <Renkineko> when I'm forcing the dataType to html, the error don't appear anymore, but I don't have the choice of the data type returned
[08:07:19] <BillCriswell> I don't work much with XML.. is there some kind of XML linter out there? lol
[08:11:32] <BillCriswell> XML Validator I guess?
[08:12:56] <_Cody> Bill yes
[08:13:02] <_Cody> best i know is validome.org
[08:13:26] <BillCriswell> THE VALIDOME
[08:13:56] <BillCriswell> I don't know why I wanted to type that in all caps.
[08:18:42] <_Cody> BillCriswell: u need something different?
[08:19:16] <Renkineko> it says there is no doctype declaration... But my first function doesn't declare any doctype and it works... and what doctype should I put for this... ?
[08:20:36] <Renkineko> ok, I'm just the biggest stupid man in the world
[08:21:02] <Renkineko> I misclosed a tag... On a foreach, yeah of course the parser is completely out of reason.
[08:21:06] * Renkineko take a rope
[08:24:02] <innociv> Can cookies be set for another domain via an ajax request from that other domain, or do I need to open the other domain's page in an iframe?
[08:27:33] <chilversc> innociv: should be possible, if that domain responds with a Set-Cookie header
[08:31:31] <Renkineko> yaaaaaaaaay it works.. Thank you helpers, you rocks :]
[08:31:34] <Renkineko> see ya ^^
[08:36:32] <dn> I'm trying to get this exact code working on my site: http://fiddle.jshell.net/cWQLn/ ...but when i click on a picture it won't stay colorized as on the jsfiddle example. What am I doing wrong? This is the code I can't get to work: http://pastebin.com/17ryTKmN
[08:39:36] <chilversc> dn: won't stay colorized, or won't colorize at all?
[08:39:58] <chilversc> dn: ah, I bet it won't colorize at all (through javascript), its the a:hover that's colorizing it
[08:40:23] <chilversc> dn: look at where you attach your event handlers compared to when the DOM is loaded
[08:41:27] <chilversc> dn: the difference between your pastebin and the jsfiddle is the setting on when to run, jsfiddle is set to "onLoad", to get exactly the same you should set it to "No wrap - in head"
[08:46:46] <dn> chilversc, yeah it does colorize on mouseover but it won't stay colorized when clicked. I'm pretty rookie to JS, so I'm unsure how to do that. Any chance you could help me a little further?
[08:48:19] <chilversc> dn: javascript is executed synchronously at the moment its found in the DOM
[08:48:45] <chilversc> dn: so imaging the page loading line by line, when it reaches your $("a") in the head the rest of the page hasn't loaded yet, so none of the a tags exist yet
[08:49:02] <chilversc> dn: the $("a") goes looking for all the a tags, and finds none (since they haven't loaded)
[08:49:53] <chilversc> dn: ways to solve it, move the scripts to the bottom of the page, wait for the dom ready event (jquery helper; $(function() { ... });) or use what was called a live event
[08:50:12] <chilversc> not sure what the new jquery calls it since they were all merged in to the single, .on method
[08:50:52] <chilversc> the live event has the advantage it will even work for href's that are added later to the dom by script
[08:52:28] <chilversc> ah, it just calls them direct and delegated events now
[08:52:53] <chilversc> dn: so currently you're using a direct event, and what was called live is now a delegated event (which uses event bubbling)
[08:52:59] <chilversc> dn: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:54:09] <maja> jquery is fun :)
[08:54:49] <dn> Wow, I'm gonna need to read up on that. But I do understand what you explained, and now it works. Thanks alot!
[08:56:26] <verism> quick question - i know that global variables/functions are generally frowned upon for scope reasons, but is there any performance benefit/tradeoff as well?
[08:57:46] <paulvd> hey, is there a way to add a class to every 3rd element, like element-3, element-6, i know nth-child(3n) would work, but there is a clear class after every 3 elements, which makes it add class to every 3, 5, 6, element
[08:58:06] <Kambfhase> Since they are global any piece of code could change them at any given time. Hence they cannot be optimised as much as local variables
[08:59:02] <verism> right - so there's no runtime or speed factors on top of that...
[09:00:06] <chilversc> verism: there is a slight one in that it has to search further up the scope chain to find the value
[09:00:33] <verism> aha - interesting
[09:00:59] <Kambfhase> paulvd: what is a 'clear class'?
[09:01:18] <chilversc> yeah, I doubt it makes that much of a difference in most cases though
[09:01:23] <Clorith> I'm trying to make an element "bounce" a little (a help element with a bounce after page load to catch the users attention), but I've hit a snag with .duration and .css
[09:01:27] <Clorith> I have $(".guide").css('height', '150px').delay(1000).css('height', '100px');
[09:01:53] <Clorith> But for some reason, it'll skip the initial .css setting it to 150px, and instead jsut trigger the .delay and set the height to 100px again
[09:02:06] <verism> good to know though; that alone tells me a little more about how script actually executes
[09:02:19] <paulvd> um like div style=clear:both
[09:02:32] <Kambfhase> Clorith: .delay() only works on animations.
[09:03:04] <Kambfhase> Clorith: you might want to use .animate() to begin with
[09:03:18] <paulvd> so i think its considering that div as well
[09:03:57] <Kambfhase> ?p @ paulvd
[09:03:57] <bot-t> paulvd, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:04:08] <Clorith> I'll look into that then, cheers =)
[09:04:22] <paulvd> ok 2 mins
[09:04:35] <paulvd> i'll use jsfiddle
[09:04:52] <paulvd> i made it so..
[09:05:59] <fraxture> hello all, i'm having the darndest time figuring out how this site (http://www.designweekportland.com/2012) achieves the scrolling effects that it does. for instance, i can't even determine how the events-lists scroll occurs. when you change overflow:hidden on the elements in the events list it still scrolls, but how? any insights?
[09:06:26] <Clorith> Ahh .animate is much smoother :D
[09:09:15] <Kambfhase> Clorith: Use the right tool, for the right job :)
[09:11:17] <paulvd> here is the fiddle
[09:11:18] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/HAEKD/
[09:14:44] <Kambfhase> paulvd: You might want to use nth-of.type http://api.jquery.com/nth-of-type-selector/
[09:19:46] <paulvd> ok but that just adds a class to the 3rd item
[09:20:06] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/HAEKD/1/
[09:32:12] <Kambfhase> paulvd: '.thumbnail:nth-of-type(3n)' 3n, not just 3 ;)
[09:34:59] <paulvd> thanks Kambfhase !

[09:38:26] <kloose> hey.. Im using hashchange script and I saw that $.browser is no longer supported from 1.9.. is it ok to replace $.browser to $.support ?
[09:40:44] <chilversc> kloose: I'd probably go with modernizer for feature detection
[09:41:18] <chilversc> jQuery.support has loads of warnings slapped all over it about things disappearing without notice
[09:42:17] <kloose> no..
[09:42:23] <chilversc> no?
[09:42:44] <kloose> Ill just replace $.browser in hashchange with $.support
[09:43:06] <chilversc> kloose: what is it you're checking for?
[09:44:02] <kloose> I dont check for nothing, Im using jQuery Hashchange event to support back/forward buttons while using ajax
[09:44:24] <chilversc> if you're not checking for anything why do you need $.browser or $.support?
[09:44:56] <kloose> because who ever developed the jQuery Hashchange event plugin put it there
[09:45:09] <chilversc> kloose: you can't just change $.browser to $.support, they are not the same
[09:46:14] <kloose> I know, but if its not recognized by jquery its basically the same thing
[09:46:20] <kloose> not working or error working
[09:46:53] <chilversc> kloose: changing it to $.support won't make it work though, you need to change the script to use feature detection instead of browser sniffing
[09:47:19] <chilversc> kloose: ie, what ever that script was using $.browser to detect, you need to change that to detect if the feature it needs is present instead
[09:48:18] <kloose> I've changed it and it works, so if I'll stumble across problems I'll use the migrate plugin to add $.browser again
[09:49:16] <norbi> hi guys
[09:49:38] <chilversc> kloose: so why did you even bother asking if its ok to swap $.browser for $.support if you were going to do so even though it isn't ok?
[09:49:52] <norbi> can you please tell me how can i call keydown on the whole html page? i want to track if a key was pressed and if its still pressed
[09:50:08] <innociv> bind it to body or document
[09:50:19] <norbi> i saw it needs a form input handler in the example, but i would prefer not to have one
[09:50:42] <norbi> innociv:  so if im binding it to a div it wont work, only on body?
[09:50:54] <innociv> It will bind to all its children
[09:54:35] <norbi> innociv: this should work? http://pastebin.com/bE4WpSDe
[10:02:34] <innociv> it should
[10:02:44] <innociv> except you want which, not witch..
[10:07:54] <norbi> innociv: yea, i observed now heh, thank you

[10:19:23] <norbi> how can i bind a function to $(body).keydown(myfunction);
[10:19:24] <norbi> ?
[10:19:56] <norbi> i mean, i dont want to write .keydown(function(){...}); i want to parse the name of the function, is that ok?
[10:21:35] <Kambfhase> norbi: that is totally fine.
[10:22:11] <norbi> Kambfhase: than you!
[10:22:28] <norbi> Kambfhase: *err thank You!

[10:29:07] <JohnnyCache> oops:
[10:29:17] <JohnnyCache> 				 $(this "posDesc").addClass('posDescHover');
[10:29:47] <JohnnyCache> I mean adding a class to "posDesc" elements inside "this"
[10:29:52] <JohnnyCache> oops 2:

[10:59:47] <twinsies> hello I am developing a simple chatbox with jQuery and PHP kind of more like FB's so heres the catch now whenever I tried click a user to chat with it, will scroll to bottom as expected but whenever tried scrolling up to view the previous conversation made it always goes back to bottom
[11:00:07] <affine> twinsies, please make a jsfiddle of it
[11:00:16] <affine> and if you cannot, redesign it to where you can ;)
[11:00:31] <affine> the server logic should obviously be almost entirely decoupled from the client-side js
[11:01:04] <twinsies> here affine
[11:01:05] <twinsies> http://jsfiddle.net/STQnH/2/
[11:01:14] <twinsies> in jsfiddle it works fine
[11:01:18] <affine> cool :)
[11:01:23] <twinsies> in the live app no
[11:01:28] <affine> what is the problem?
[11:02:19] <affine> appears to work fine for me in firefox
[11:02:21] <twinsies> when I tried scrolling up it goes back to bottom
[11:02:25] <affine> not here
[11:02:29] <affine> which browser are you testing in?
[11:02:35] <twinsies> yeah in jsfiddle it works fine
[11:02:42] <affine> strange :(
[11:02:55] <twinsies> I dont understand why it's not working in the live app
[11:03:04] <affine> yeah usually scrolling is a js problem
[11:03:16] <affine> hopefully it's not some other script messing with it
[11:03:18] <poseid> when does it make sense to load jquery plugins with commonjs?
[11:03:42] <twinsies> so theres no chance?
[11:03:47] <twinsies> :'(
[11:04:47] <affine> twinsies, I don't know what is wrong with ti
[11:04:51] <affine> might try a debugger
[11:06:28] <xavier23> Hi…..anybody here using magnific-popup ?
[11:07:46] <twinsies> @affine is there a way to disable the auto-scroll function after it has executed ?
[11:07:46] <b-ot> twinsies: memorised “affine”.
[11:08:01] <twinsies> am sorry b-ot
[11:08:23] <affine> twinsies, it scrolls down just when you scroll up?
[11:08:29] <affine> is the scroll animated?
[11:08:43] <twinsies> yes...
[11:08:53] <affine> the buggy scroll is animated?
[11:08:56] <affine> well that should be a red flag
[11:09:03] <affine> .animate() is called somewhere, right?
[11:09:35] <twinsies> just in a particular file
[11:10:19] <twinsies> it shouldn't be repeatitive because I'm destroying the session after the user has click another user to chat with
[11:26:41] <`teh1> has anyone worked with jplayer playlist?
[11:26:54] <xavier23> Hi…. anyone know a good lightbox / popup plugin or script for query?
[11:26:57] <xavier23> *jquery
[11:27:09] <JohnnyCache> well
[11:27:20] <xavier23> (i need to just display html in lightbox , not an image)
[11:27:21] <`teh1> my issue is that i cant seem to figure out how to access the jplayer object that is created by jplayerplaylist
[11:27:52] <JohnnyCache> just made a symbolic donation to jQuery foundation :) i can't stop jQuery. that's amazing!!!
[11:43:53] <`teh1> lol
[11:44:13] <`teh1> is there a reason why onbeforeunload handler does not give me access to elements' data?
[11:44:33] <`teh1> at least, not the jplayer div's data nor jplayer methods
[11:59:46] <solifugus> .live used to work for dynamically added html.. but can someone tell me why the same syntax doesn't work with .on ??
[11:59:48] <solifugus> $('.tasks-title-column').on('click', function() { alert('WTF?!'); } );
[12:00:44] <shoky> solifugus: because that's not how you use .on() to emulate .live()'s delegation. have you read the docs about .on() ?
[12:00:53] <shoky> solifugus: specifically about event delegation
[12:01:03] <affine> I'd just use .click(function(){});
[12:01:07] <affine> for dynamic html
[12:01:08] <affine> works for me
[12:01:20] <shoky> that won't work like .live
[12:01:29] <shoky> and won't work for new elements
[12:01:35] <solifugus> shoky: I realize it's not working that way.. but cannot seem to figure out how to make it work.. The ways it's explained here seems wrong: http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/event_on.asp
[12:01:43] <affine> oh wait, for bindign elements AFTER they are created
[12:01:44] <affine> I get you
[12:01:51] <shoky> ?on @ solifugus
[12:01:51] <bot-t> solifugus, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:01:54] <affine> I seem to just work around that design myself.
[12:02:06] <shoky> solifugus: that's the link you should read, definitely not w3fools
[12:03:00] <shoky> solifugus: and if you're too lazy to read.. to emulate live you'd do:  $('body').on('click', '.tasks-title-column', function(){..})
[12:03:03] <sekyms> I'm having a difficult time writing qUnit tests for a project that uses Twitter's Bootstrap.  When a modal is spawned it is putting the overlay outside of the qunit-fixture, so when the next test is run the overlay is not removed.   Anyone run into this problem?
[12:04:16] <solifugus> shoky: seriously?  ok.. it's more complicated now...  I miss .live
[12:04:23] <shoky> .live is evil
[12:05:05] <solifugus> I'm sure you must have some reason for saying that.. but as far as I've used it.. it worked fine..
[12:05:11] <tw2113> i wager the jQuery devs got rid of .live for valid reasons, and not just to "torture" users
[12:05:24] <solifugus> I've also never found a way to change effective css of dynamically created tags.. thereafer.....
[12:05:39] <sekyms> you can use the migrate plugin and keep live until you fix your stuff
[12:05:45] <solifugus> shoky: thanks
[12:07:10] <tw2113> shoky, would you say there are perf benefits with on over live?
[12:07:42] <shoky> tw2113: no.. live is effectively just a shortcut to .on
[12:08:06] <solifugus> shoky: so what makes .live evil?
[12:08:09] <tw2113> you're not helping your case with saying it's evil with that one :P
[12:09:11] <shoky> heh, it's evil because you do $(something).live(...)  and it doesn't even set any event handlers on "something"
[12:09:30] <ajpiano> solifugus: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11115864/whats-wrong-with-the-jquery-live-method
[12:09:47] <shoky> and it makes users like you have no idea what's really going on
[12:10:00] <Rinthe> how do i stop a link from going to the link and use pushstate instead?
[12:10:01] <shoky> because it's such a twist of the normal API
[12:10:15] <sekyms> prevent default
[12:10:42] <sekyms> event.preventDefault
[12:11:07] <shoky> it's also just evil spelled backwards
[12:12:14] <sekyms> ajpiano: I don't suppose you have done any qUnit stuff with twitters bootstrap?
[12:12:29] <Rinthe> is e.preventDefault better or return false?
[12:12:48] <shoky> Rinthe: the former
[12:12:55] <tw2113> i always use preventDefault
[12:12:58] <Rinthe> okay
[12:13:13] <sekyms> http://css-tricks.com/return-false-and-prevent-default/
[12:17:52] <Rinthe> thanks!
[12:19:32] <anew> what do you guys prefer? image carosel on hover, or the bootstrap popup?
[12:20:29] <`teh1> neither
[12:20:48] <affine> what is the easiest way to integrate jquery ui menu into a right click context menu?
[12:21:04] <affine> I can't seem to get the default context menu not appear, even with .preventDefault()
[12:21:25] <flcl1> return false
[12:21:34] <affine> seriously?
[12:21:58] <anew> `teh1 neither? really ?
[12:22:03] <anew> what do you use then ?
[12:22:18] <affine> return false doesn't seem t o work in my case, flcl1, if you were talking tom e
[12:22:56] <`teh1> anew:  image carousel on click :P
[12:23:08] <flcl1> do you use .preventDefault() in click handler?
[12:23:43] <rosieres> why is this inline statement wrong ? background-size:  '+ if ( 1 + 1 == 2) {cover} else {contain} +';
[12:24:21] <`teh1> rosieres:  ((1+1==2)?cover:contain)
[12:24:38] <anew> `teh1 meh that sucks because then the user has to know to click
[12:24:39] <`teh1> https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+ternary&oq=javascript+ternary&aqs=chrome.0.57j5j0l2j62l2.2458j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
[12:25:28] <`teh1> anew:  so you want them to get frustrated because it keeps popping up when they move their mouse around?
[12:26:18] <rosieres> teh1 : THANKS
[12:26:19] <flcl1>  ? background-size:  '+ (function(){if ( 1 + 1 == 2) {return cover} else {return contain};})() +' ;)
[12:26:32] <`teh1> flcl1:  way, WAY overkill.
[12:26:49] <flcl1> complex cover or contain statements
[12:27:11] <`teh1> but he didnt imply thats what he needs
[12:27:23] <anew> `teh1 just seems more logical.  never been frustrated at cycles on hover... if u dont want to to cycle just move your mouse away from the image...
[12:27:29] <flcl1> and of course i used ;)
[12:28:21] <`teh1> anew:  i may be anal, but i hate seeing my mouse on top of images i am trying to look at. bugs the shit out of me :P
[12:28:48] <`teh1> anyways, clicking to pop up the carousel is more standard behavior and i guarantee will be clearer to your average nub user
[12:29:19] <`teh1> hover is a bit weird and depending on how fast they slide through can be extremely unclear
[12:29:20] <anew> ok one more question, sending an ajax request when a user's cursor leaves an input field is what actoin?  keyup/keydown is for typing
[12:29:23] <anew> but what about when you leave the filed
[12:29:27] <anew> *field
[12:29:41] <tw2113> mouseout
[12:29:43] <`teh1> $('el').on('mouseout',function(){});
[12:29:46] <anew> cool thx
[12:34:10] <norbi> im using keydown and keyup, but it triggers in every x ms, but i want to trigger it only once until keyup, i thought thats the default functionality
[12:34:15] <norbi> why is that happening?
[12:34:27] <CocoStorm> I'm trying to have the box 20px down but instead the whole 'container' div is moved down so there is a 20px gap between the nav bar and the container http://jsfiddle.net/28NnT/
[12:37:10] <Rinthe> history.pushState() or window.history.pushstate?
[12:38:45] <shoky> Rinthe: those are the same thing, no?
[12:39:02] <Rinthe> i was asking if they were ;p
[12:39:08] <Rinthe> haha
[12:39:54] <shoky> Rinthe: in the browser, window is the global object, its properties are always available without explicitly writing "window."
[12:40:14] <Rinthe> i see
[12:42:33] <rosieres> and how the heck do I output this correctly ? -> background-size:  "'+ (function(){if ( 1 + 1 == 2) {+cover+} else {+contain+};})() +'";
[12:44:29] <flcl1> what the problem?
[12:45:04] <flcl1> can you erite all the line of code
[12:45:32] <shoky> CocoStorm: put display:inline-block  on the box
[12:45:45] <affine> is there a zoom plugin that works on any div and not just images?
[12:45:58] <affine> I am looking to zoom and pan an entire div
[12:46:18] <Rinthe> do i use .load() to do the pushstate thing? without refreshing page
[12:47:35] <anew> `teh1 that doesnt work if the user tabs out of the input box
[12:47:37] <shoky> Rinthe: that's one option, yeah
[12:47:49] <CocoStorm> shoky, thanks
[12:48:00] <anew> shoky  $('el').on('mouseout',function(){}); this works if the users mouses out of an input box but does not work if they tab out
[12:48:01] <Rinthe> shoky: what are the other options? is there a best one?
[12:48:09] <anew> how can i do both (mouseout and tabout)
[12:48:19] <`teh1> anew:  for that you should do unfocus i think
[12:48:29] <`teh1> oh
[12:48:48] <`teh1> blur, not unfocus
[12:49:10] <`teh1> however i think 'change' works too for input fields
[12:49:26] <shoky> CocoStorm: i fixed up some of your css to make more sense  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/28NnT/5/
[12:49:34] <`teh1> anew:  ^
[12:49:52] <CocoStorm> shoky, thanks, what did you change?
[12:50:09] <anew> let me tyr change
[12:50:28] <sekyms> shaky any quint experience?
[12:51:01] <shoky> Rinthe: it depends what you're loading, there isn't a best one. $.ajax is the most flexible though. but .load() might be enough and simpler to use, if it works for you
[12:51:07] <anew> blur works
[12:51:12] <`teh1> yeah
[12:51:31] <shoky> sekyms: hardly, sry
[12:51:37] <sekyms> no worries
[12:51:45] <`teh1> anew:  keeping in mind "enter/return" keys trigger change but not blur
[12:52:07] <sekyms> shaky I just came across this weird behavior using bootstrap or query ui
[12:52:25] <Rinthe> shoky: thanks
[12:55:28] <anew> what do u mean `teh1
[12:55:28] * R0ckET t
[12:55:31] <anew> so i shouldnt use it
[12:55:50] <`teh1> anew:  if you use blur, hitting the enter or return key will not trigger the event, but if you use change it will
[12:55:59] <anew> hmmm
[12:55:59] <anew> ok
[12:56:07] <`teh1> which one you use depends on what functionality you want
[12:56:17] <`teh1> im not actually sure of the other differences aside from that
[12:56:27] <`teh1> i mean, in the end, blur triggers whenever the element goes out of focus
[12:56:28] <shoky> hitting enter doesn't trigger change on IE, btw
[12:56:33] <`teh1> change varies on ifferent elements
[12:56:46] <`teh1> i.e. on select elements it is triggered when the dropdown is changed
[12:56:56] <`teh1> shoky:  holy how that is stupid
[12:57:02] <`teh1> cow*
[12:57:34] <shoky> donno if stupid, but it's very annoying sometimes ya
[12:58:12] <shoky> they're not violating the standards there, iirc
[12:58:56] <shoky> cause hitting enter in a text input is (at least traditionally) supposed to trigger the form submit
[13:00:04] <`teh1> shoky:  the stupid part is doing something different from everyone else
[13:04:16] <affine> are there any actually working jquery pan zoom libraries?
[13:06:19] <shoky> `teh1: i donno if that's reason enough to call it stupid :P but im not very informed to argue with you, tho im sure some other people would, see a small example at the bottom here http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11556
[13:07:16] <shoky> this is all supposed to be done with the input event anyways, in html5
[13:07:30] <`teh1> ahah
[13:07:36] <shoky> mm or i might be confusing things, nevermind ;p
[13:07:44] <`teh1> uh
[13:07:48] <`teh1> ahah at the jsfiddle link
[13:07:53] <`teh1> it says oldIE though
[13:07:55] <`teh1> what version?
[13:08:17] <shoky> definitely IE6-9  but i think IE10 also
[13:10:03] <shoky> yeah ie10 too
[13:11:26] <guy> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c22750b8e53808a6f312
[13:11:41] <guy> is there a way to catch user input before user has actually changed the input value?
[13:13:23] <jastor> keydown?
[13:13:31] <jastor> or keypress, or which one it is
[13:16:40] <guy> console.log( String.fromCharCode(e.keyCode) );
[13:16:51] <guy> gives upper case value of the characetr..
[13:18:34] <shoky> guy: key and character are 2 different things
[13:18:57] <guy> right. how do I get the actual character from .which ?
[13:19:16] <shoky> with what event?
[13:19:33] <guy> keydown
[13:19:37] <guy> (note, not keyup)
[13:19:59] <guy> I need to sanitize user input before it has actually changed input value
[13:20:21] <guy> unless there is another event that I am not aware of between keydown and keyup
[13:20:28] <guy> shit. keypress
[13:22:20] <shoky> ya you'd need keypress to get the actual character
[13:22:41] <guy> hm. event still doesn't contain the actual character.
[13:23:36] <shoky> it should..
[13:23:46] <shoky> guy: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/wdexg/
[13:24:02] <guy> shoky: doesn't work with e.g. 功
[13:24:22] <shoky> oh
[13:27:27] <shoky> guy: maybe e.charCode ?
[13:27:45] <guy> that's non standard parameter.
[13:30:30] <mastodon_agha> hello guys
[13:34:17] <flying_rhino> hello guys
[13:35:04] <flying_rhino> I have a question about procedurally creating form elements (either using innerhtml or via jquery). Idea is to create form elements with json
[13:35:15] <flying_rhino> the question is how to escape quotes for <inpit value="some_value"> and html tags for <textarea>some_value</textarea>
[13:35:28] <flying_rhino> since I parse it as string in javascript
[13:36:24] <Pinkamena_D> hello again, Looking for a way to make a checkbox change the attribute of another element. I want it to make the text firle become required or not
[13:36:26] <flying_rhino> is there jquery or vanilla js function for that. Or maybe there is a way to do that other than parsing ti as string
[13:36:29] <Pinkamena_D> here is what I have: http://www.codepen.io/seraphzz/pen/xHLgu
[13:36:47] <Pinkamena_D> text field*
[13:39:38] <Pinkamena_D> ok, I see i forgot the semis at the end, but thats not why it was not working
[13:39:50] <Pinkamena_D> I have also tried using .prop()
[13:40:41] <Kambfhase> Pinkamena_D: Use events. http://www.codepen.io/seraphzz/pen/uvaon
[13:41:37] <Kambfhase> flying_rhino: if you create your elements properly via jQuery you might not even have to bother about escaping quotes. (total guess)
[13:43:30] <Pinkamena_D> kambfhase, what is the last line in that code
[13:43:33] <flying_rhino> Kambfhase: the thing is I concatenate strings together like output_str = '<input type="text" value="'+value_from_json+'"/>'
[13:43:55] <Pinkamena_D> $(this).is(':checked'));
[13:44:05] <flying_rhino> now that value_from_json variable could contain " that can screw the process.
[13:44:10] <Pinkamena_D> why is this needed?
[13:44:38] <flying_rhino> Kambfhase: do you understand?
[13:45:08] <Kambfhase> that line checks if $(this) which is the checkbox, is checked. Iff so, that evaluates to true.
[13:45:35] <Pinkamena_D> ohh
[13:45:43] <Pinkamena_D> the arguments are on two lines
[13:45:48] <Pinkamena_D> thanks!
[13:46:08] <Kambfhase> yes, because the form on codepen is kinda narrow. :)
[13:47:52] <maja> any one know any triks to get a input that is put in place via ajax to be used by datepicker ?
[13:48:15] <Kambfhase> flying_rhino: try $('<input>',{type:'string',value:value_from_json})
[13:48:53] <flying_rhino> Kambfhase: thanks
[13:48:58] <Kambfhase> np
[13:49:49] <flying_rhino> Cant that be used for any tag? Even something like $('<a>',{href:'whatever'}) ?
[13:49:58] <flying_rhino> *can
[13:50:13] <flying_rhino> Kambfhase: or is it just for form elements?
[13:50:22] <Kambfhase> anything
[13:51:31] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/2trFDy3Z it works but #post-view disappears first and then comes back. is there a better way of doing this?
[13:52:02] <CocoStorm> hi guys, why doens't my #box1 div fade in when the page is loaded?  http://jsfiddle.net/auujj/1/
[13:53:07] <shoky> Rinthe:  remove line 16?
[13:53:36] <flying_rhino> Kambfhase: okay one more question. Is it possible to chache those generated elements? Like put them all in some variable and then append them to page? The reason I ask is because of optimization. Say that I have 100 table rows I want to generate. It is faster to put them in string ant then append.
[13:53:37] <Rinthe> shoky: dont i have to remove it first?
[13:53:50] <Kambfhase> CocoStorm: you did not load jQuery, look in the console.
[13:54:11] <Rinthe> shoky: oh i guess i dont..
[13:54:15] <Rinthe> .load replaces everything?
[13:54:17] <flying_rhino> Kambfhase: I beleive that document fragment can do some of that. Does jquery supports that?
[13:54:20] <shoky> Rinthe: yes
[13:54:41] <CocoStorm> Kambfhase, on the left? oh I've added the checkmark it still doesn't work
[13:55:05] <Kambfhase> yeah, go with a document fragment. var frag = $(document.createDocumentFragment); /* append to frag */ frag.appendTo(foo)
[13:55:44] <rb-> you actually need to set #box1 to display: none;
[13:55:46] <shoky> CocoStorm: the box needs to be hidden before you can fade it in..
[13:55:59] <CocoStorm> Oh I see.. that makes sense lol
[13:56:02] <CocoStorm> my bad
[13:56:03] <CocoStorm> thanks
[13:56:11] <shoky> tho if you just have it with display: none
[13:56:17] <shoky> the fadeIn will put display: block
[13:56:28] <shoky> (and not inline-block)
[13:56:55] <CocoStorm> shoky, oh I see :S
[14:00:22] <CocoStorm> shoky, it's not working :S
[14:00:27] <shoky> CocoStorm: you could try .fadeIn("slow").css({display:'inline-block'})  or just .animate the opacity yourself
[14:00:51] <shoky> CocoStorm: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/auujj/13/
[14:01:12] <flying_rhino> Kambfhase: thank you a lot! Two more things, please. (1) is it possible to append fragment to another fragment? (2) I get how to add properties for, say, input, but how to attach text to textarea (since it is inside the tag?)
[14:01:42] <flying_rhino> Kambfhase: sorry for being a bother but doing things your way would save me a lot of time and nerves.
[14:01:44] <shoky> CocoStorm: btw to include jquery on jsfiddle you need to choose it in the top-left select-box
[14:01:53] <CocoStorm> shoky, ah yes that works I see
[14:02:24] <Kambfhase> Once you append a fragment onto a parent fragment the inner one just *disappears*. So, yes.
[14:02:58] <CocoStorm> thanks shoky
[14:03:58] <Kambfhase> flying_rhino: (2) $('<textarea>',{html:"foo"}) You can use most the jQ methods here!
[14:06:04] <flying_rhino> Kambfhase: so... can you glue two fragments together? Nevermind, I'll check
[14:07:46] <flying_rhino> Kambfhase: anyway thanks for everything.
[14:09:11] <Voting1> I've got an removeclass-based animation that smoothly migrates some elements in firefox but in chrome, it just waits and jumps the elements to the B position... that's ONE of my bugs... anyone willing to take a look? http://206.125.173.67:2120/workspace/index.html
[14:11:48] <Voting1> I've got an removeclass-based animation that smoothly migrates some elements in firefox but in chrome, it just waits and jumps the elements to the B position... that's ONE of my bugs... anyone willing to take a look? http://206.125.173.67:2120/workspace/index.html   CLICK ON "GA-PRESIDENT" and see the new element move in... what am I doing wrong?
[14:16:03] <Rinthe> what does popstate mean?
[14:16:45] <Kambfhase> Rinthe: that's got to do with the hash in the url baar
[14:16:59] <Rinthe> is tehre a way to check for popstate?
[14:17:22] <Kambfhase> you can check for hashchange
[14:21:39] <Rinthe> is there a way to check for the difference when i link a link that triggers a pushstate and when i go to that link directly via the url bar
[14:21:45] <Rinthe> click a link*
[14:24:32] <Rinthe> is there a difference between window.onpopstate = function(event) { and $(window).bind('popstate', function() {
[14:35:03] <scar> i have a css menu that i want to hover and have it appear (easy with css), but i dont want to disappear until the mouse has mousedout for 5 seconds--but i want to prevent looped events if the user mouses in and out a lot. how can i create a var to control the event and cancel it when i need to?
[14:40:10] <Kambfhase> Rinthe: the first version will overwrite already existing handlers. go for the second one.
[14:40:34] <Kambfhase> scar: google for hover intent
[14:41:03] <shoky> Voting:  the problem is that in chrome when you remove the overlay class, the columns have left: "auto" and jqueryui doesn't animate to "auto"
[14:41:33] <shoky> Voting: maybe putting "left: 0"  on .column in your css will do the trick, assuming that value works for you
[14:41:33] <scar> Kambfhase, eh... i want it to display immediately as a hover, not hoverIntent, and i only want it to stay AFTER mouseout--- hoverIntent will be the best soution for this?
[14:42:07] <shoky> Voting: or.. just do the animation yourself with .animate
[14:43:13] <shoky> scar:  you can use setTimeout and clearTimeout to clear the previous timeout before setting a new one
[14:43:33] <shoky> in case you're using setTimeout for the delay, that is
[14:44:01] <liox_> hello I'm using the plugin Caman.js filters to generate an image on the canvas but in the time I send this picture to an input file it saves the picture without the filter someone has an idea what can be?

[14:48:55] <Wamer> hello guys ..
[14:49:10] <Iszak_> Anyone recommend a jquery library that'll allow styling of all currently unstylable form elements?
[14:49:34] <Iszak_> Best one i'm seeing is uniform.
[14:49:40] <Wamer> "I wanted to create something that will everyone enjoy not only from the visual…" vs "I wanted to create something that everyone will enjoy not only from the visual…" ?
[14:50:07] <Wamer> please can any native english speaker tell which one is correct? :)
[14:50:13] <shoky> Wamer: the 2nd. didn't know this is #english  :P

[15:00:45] <vsync_> holla holla get dolla
[15:01:02] <Kambfhase> ho yo bro
[15:01:04] <benbro> how can I make an ajax call to http or https depending if the website is ssl or not?
[15:01:17] <benbro> something like //example.com instead of http://example.com ?
[15:05:57] <rosieres> why is my ternary not with the expected value true ? -> http://jsfiddle.net/rsysweb/xqrse/1/ click picture . . . you see in console.log the data
[15:08:29] <Rinthe> is there a .all() in jquery?
[15:08:45] <Rinthe> nm
[15:08:48] <rosieres> benbro -> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexof.asp
[15:10:09] <rosieres> shoky: could you gibe me advice on my ternary ?
[15:11:48] <jayZ> hello
[15:14:27] <relipse> does anyone know how to left-align inside a <th> using css?
[15:14:34] <eobet> does someone have a link to a small image pre-loader that doesn't load images twice?
[15:14:52] <relipse> make your own?
[15:15:10] <`teh1> eobet:  would be really easy to make...
[15:15:21] <`teh1> relipse:  text-align: center;
[15:15:32] <`teh1> same relipse as in php?
[15:16:32] <rosieres> eobet: or use lazyload
[15:17:04] <shoky> rosieres: what's not working?  and btw  this === window  inside foo()
[15:17:05] <eobet> rosieres: saw that but it says "latest version is not a drop in replacement"
[15:17:54] <shoky> rosieres: well nevermind my question, the problem is 'this'
[15:18:03] <rosieres> shoky:  why ?
[15:18:18] <shoky> rosieres: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/xqrse/2/
[15:19:10] <shoky> rosieres: because that's how javascript works.. if you just call a function with  "foo()"   then this === window inside, unless you do something special
[15:19:23] <shoky> rosieres: or unless foo is also a proeprty of some object and you call it with "obj.foo()"
[15:20:12] <rosieres> shoky: OK thank you for this !
[15:20:21] <shoky> NP
[15:20:43] <anew> when i console.log(json); i get true, but when i if ( json === 'true'){  it never works ? what am i doing wrong ?
[15:21:17] <shoky> anew:  json could be the boolean value true and not the string value 'true', they are 2 completely different things
[15:21:23] <shoky> and === distinguishes between them
[15:21:32] <anew> i tried =, == and ===
[15:21:42] <anew> but all with 'true'
[15:21:50] <anew> i am echo 'true' on the server side
[15:21:51] <shoky> anew:  try without the quotes ...
[15:21:54] <anew> so it should be a string ?
[15:21:57] <anew> ok
[15:21:58] <shoky> no
[15:22:05] <relipse> teh1: there is a textbox
[15:22:11] <shoky> depends how you're fetching it.. are you parsing it as json or not
[15:22:18] <relipse> teh1: there is a checkbox i mean
[15:22:28] <relipse> that doesnt seem to support text-align: center
[15:22:44] <`teh1> relipse:  th{text-align: center;}
[15:22:47] <anew> server side i echo 'true';
[15:22:57] <anew> ajax i have dataType: 'json'
[15:23:07] <shoky> anew: then that parses the string as JSON, it's no longer a string
[15:23:18] <scar> if i have a <ul> with many <li> elements that are out of view, but all in a horizontal line with overflow:hidden; -- what is the best simple method to scroll this to the left and when it hits the end, just keep repeating?
[15:23:30] <anew> so what is it ? how do i test for it then ?
[15:23:40] <shoky> anew:  === true  ?
[15:23:44] <anew> nope
[15:24:05] <`teh1> scar:  what i have done in the past is move out of sight elements back to the end of the list
[15:24:11] <anew> lol i tried =, ==, === and 'true' true
[15:24:12] <anew> for all
[15:24:36] <shoky> anew: anyway im not sure 'true' counts as proper json..
[15:24:56] <`teh1> 'true' is a string, true is a boolean (AFAIK)
[15:25:02] <scar> `teh1, interesting approach--- how do i determine this? how does JS know the second the LI is out of view? im just wondering if i do that, i need to animate scroll with positioning? seems like it wouldnt work but i have never tred something simialr
[15:25:38] <`teh1> scar:  assuming you have it on a timer and it's a carousel, every step you check the positioning and make sure that it is in view
[15:26:28] <`teh1> shoky:  anew: also 'string' is not valid, but "string" is in JSON
[15:26:38] <`teh1> which i personally find annoying :P
[15:26:49] <shoky> `teh1:  he's not outputting any quotes anyways
[15:26:53] <`teh1> okay
[15:26:55] <anew> maybe that's it
[15:26:56] <anew> ""
[15:29:33] <shoky> anew: uhm.. console.log(typeof json)
[15:29:53] <not_mike> is there any way I can get the commented out script to work? (involves regular js, jquery, some css) -> http://jsfiddle.net/Y9V8e/962/
[15:29:59] <anew> i got it, must have either been 1) "" or 2) json_encode
[15:30:06] <anew> not sure which i change both then it worked
[15:30:42] <anew> $('#pappend').hide(); if there are 3 elemens with #pappend how can i remove all 3, this only removes one ?
[15:30:59] <shoky> anew: ID's need to be unique
[15:31:10] <shoky> use a class otherwise and $('.pappend').hide()
[15:31:12] <anew> ah if i change it to a class it will remove all classes ?
[15:31:13] <anew> ok
[15:32:37] <shoky> Voting: saw my answer to your q? you keep disconnecting
[15:34:19] <sal002> I am trying to use jquery to feed json data into a Google Visualization chart at http://www.coinchoose.com/exampleUsingPHPTime.html.  Keeps on defaulting to 1970 (json from http://www.coinchoose.com/getDataTimeF.php).  Am I missing something basic?
[15:34:29] <sal002> Kept on playing with the Date() constructor
[15:38:14] <relipse> can someone please go to http://jim.clearbugs.com/members/?theme=humanity login as test_test_test admin testtest and tell me what css i need to apply so the 2nd <th> column header aligns to the left (with the checkbox)?
[15:40:10] <scar> im really confused as to how to get the horizontal scrolling of LI elements as a loop
[15:40:42] <scar> im not even sure how to detect if an item is out of view, however i still dont understand what i would use to scroll the items
[15:50:33] <relipse> shoky u here?
[15:50:57] <relipse> shoky: i realize you are a jquery guy, but if you know a bit of css can you help me position my text to the left in a <th>
[15:53:26] <Rinthe> $('#post-view').load(url + ' #content, footer'); how do i search within this #content in that url ?
[15:53:37] <Rinthe> by search i mean select
[15:57:14] <shoky> relipse:  text-align: left; padding-left: 5px;
[15:58:17] <relipse> if you can, can you go to http://jim.clearbugs.com/members/?theme=humanity login as test_test_test admin testtest and tell me what css i need to apply so the 2nd <th> column header aligns to the left (with the checkbox)?
[15:58:23] <Rinthe> i cant do $('#post-view').load(url + ' #content, footer').find() can i?
[15:58:27] <shoky> relipse:  text-align: left; padding-left: 5px;
[15:58:31] <Rinthe> that'll find within #post-view right
[15:58:36] <relipse> i tried text-align: left and it didnt wokr
[15:58:42] <shoky> works for me
[15:58:48] <relipse> on the <th>?
[15:58:51] <shoky> ya
[15:59:00] <relipse> let me try to reproduce in chrome
[15:59:42] <relipse> yeah it works for the checkbox, but the text is aligned to the right for some reason
[16:00:14] <shoky> you have  position:absolute and right:0  on it
[16:01:13] <relipse> oh i see
[16:01:14] <relipse> thanks!
[16:04:09] <relipse> do you see a way i can target that column in the css?
[16:06:38] <jastor> relipse, Mayby want to paginate that list later on
[16:06:53] <momomomomo> Afternoon :)
[16:08:15] <Rinthe> when i use pushstate and .load() to load a new page into a div, will it register for google analytics?
[16:08:37] <Rinthe> or does it depend on if i loaded the google anayltics code in the new page?
[16:08:57] <jastor> Rinthe, Do both pages have ga?
[16:09:04] <Rinthe> yes all pages haev it on the site
[16:09:07] <jastor> Rinthe, Or just the first or the second one
[16:09:18] <Rinthe> jastor: all
[16:09:21] <jastor> Rinthe, You might want to look up the ga jquery plugin
[16:09:58] <jastor> There are several wait and ill give you a good one
[16:10:41] <jastor> Rinthe, https://github.com/christianhellsten/jquery-google-analytics/
[16:11:25] <Rinthe> jastor: that was updated 2 years ago
[16:11:39] <relipse> jastor: havent decided if i like the pagination
[16:11:40] <jastor> Rinthe, Still works ;)
[16:12:05] <relipse> shoky: that css is important, maybe i'll get rid of the <span>
[16:12:54] <relipse> ok i fixed it
[16:13:27] <jastor> relipse, The search box would still work with it though if you use datatables pagination how its supposed to be used .. But if you wan to cahnge several rows quickly (low, med, high priiruty and whatnot) you can get the "load X more rows when I come close to the bottom"
[16:13:42] <momomomomo> Rinthe: Or, if you want to understand what's going on, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13131488/jquery-mobile-and-google-analytics-single-page-template
[16:15:01] <Rinthe> momomomomo: isnt it better to just push the code in wheneveer i pushstate than to get a plugin?
[16:15:13] <jastor> relipse, When you come closer to rows in the 1000 datatables take a while to load data
[16:15:37] <relipse> hopefully there won't be 1000 open bugs at a time....
[16:15:42] <relipse> we just switched from YUI datatables
[16:15:57] <jastor> relipse, Im only mentioning ;)
[16:15:58] <momomomomo> Rinthe: so many ways to skin a cat
[16:16:11] <Rinthe> momomomomo: why would u skin a cat
[16:16:18] <momomomomo> to get a great coat
[16:16:20] <relipse> jastor: might have to do if > x rows then enable pagination
[16:16:20] <jastor> Rinthe, For the meat .. Mmmm cat
[16:16:27] <momomomomo> jastor: win-win
[16:16:36] <Rinthe> ew
[16:17:00] <jastor> relipse, Of course, if its less it doesnt paginate .. Standard issue :D
[16:17:23] <relipse> i'm not a fan of paging through entries
[16:17:29] <relipse> i like to use ctrl+f
[16:17:31] <relipse> etc
[16:17:43] <relipse> i hate those limits when you are searching too
[16:17:50] <relipse> 25 results limit or whatever
[16:18:08] <jastor> relipse, ?
[16:18:09] <momomomomo> or you could have a 'show all' filter to leave that up to the user, so that they don't have to wait forever for your page
[16:18:14] <momomomomo> call me crazy
[16:18:38] <jastor> relipse, Why use ctrl+f when you got a good filter box in the top right?
[16:18:52] <jastor> If you like ctrl+f then bind it to tab into the searchbox?
[16:20:06] <Rinthe> hmm i was just looking at google analytics tracking code settings. theres a subdomains option, do i need to turn that on to use with tumblr sites?
[16:20:15] <jastor> Autofocus*
[16:20:22] <Rinthe> blogname.tumblr.com is the url for tumblr blogs
[16:20:51] <not_mike> is there any way I can get the commented out script to work? (involves regular js, jquery, some css) -> http://jsfiddle.net/Y9V8e/962/
[16:23:17] <jastor> not_mike, $("img:hidden").appendTo("<a whatever");
[16:24:47] <jastor> not_mike, Excuse me for saying this, but you really should read up on html5, css3 and jquery and not mix stuff together like that
[16:25:10] <not_mike> you are fine, i am still learning
[16:25:16] <not_mike> thank you sir
[16:26:01] <Rinthe> momomomomo: do i have to set the account# for google analytics before i push in _gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/thank-you.html']); every time?

[16:26:09] <banister`shop> .
[16:26:10] <not_mike> , jastor ?
[16:26:19] <banister`shop> what's the difference between hover() and mouseover() ?
[16:26:34] <jastor> not_mike, Yes?
[16:26:37] <not_mike> by '<a whatever' did you mean the actual link?
[16:26:46] <momomomomo> Rinthe: not my script, I'd suggest reading it and trying it out
[16:28:07] <jastor> not_mike, To be honest, Im not quite sure what youre trying to accomplish with  "commented out script to work"  after reading your code again
[16:28:46] <systemfault> banister`shop: mouseover is usually not what you want… as the event is fired many times while the element is hovered
[16:29:13] <systemfault> banister`shop: .hover uses "mouseenter" and "mouseleave"
[16:29:17] <banister`shop> thanks
[16:29:28] <mcflurry> Qunit question: One of the first lines in a testing report is a list of browser versions. What is the meaning of this list? Or where can I find information about it in the documentation?
[16:29:41] <jastor> not_mike, The $(hiz).mouseover adn css code can be solved with css alone
[16:29:41] <not_mike> the commented out script and the one blow it (that isn't commented out) are nearly the same. the only difference is that the commented out script has an a tag, and doesn't work (the google image does not show up on hover). without the a tsg, it works, jastor
[16:29:50] <not_mike> below*
[16:29:59] <not_mike> 'a' tag*
[16:30:12] <banister`shop> systemfault: thanks
[16:30:26] <not_mike> i want to know how to make it work with the 'a' tag as well, jastor
[16:32:09] <jastor> instead of css("visibility","visible/hidden"); use .show(); and .hide();   not saying that this will do the trick just that its more "proper" of showing and hiding stuff
[16:34:30] <jastor> not_mike, Cant see any obvious reason why it wouldnt work
[16:35:16] <CocoStorm> why when I use .toggle(), the button moves with the animation?
[16:36:18] <not_mike> show and hide make it nonfucntional
[16:37:14] <jastor> not_mike, Ah sorry your style="visibility:hidden" should be style="display:none"
[16:37:38] <not_mike> I've tried that before, and it created more problems for me
[16:39:07] <eobet> some suggested I write my own image preloader… after googling a bit… how is this? http://pastie.org/7998461
[16:39:44] <jastor> not_mike, I dont like abandoning people like this but its 01:40 in the morning here I need to get some sleep for work
[16:40:06] <not_mike> you're fine, I'll keep messing with it and wait till something works
[16:40:55] <shoky> eobet: .css('background-image') returns a string. you can't .each() it
[16:41:12] <jastor> not_mike, And please, dont use $(document). over and over again in a loop .. Once outside the loop should be sufficient
[16:41:37] <jastor> If you add something to group them, like class="oiz" and then $(".oiz")  instead of $(oizn)
[16:42:14] <Rinthe> momomomomo: read what?
[16:42:24] <eobet> hmm… .attr also only returns the first element apparently
[16:42:26] <momomomomo> the stackoverflow link
[16:42:41] <shoky> eobet: also donno how much that technique will help. also you're using 'this' inside the first each as if it's the source... instead of $(this).attr('src')
[16:43:06] <Rinthe> momomomo: i did but that didnt mention anything about loading content into div with pushstate
[16:43:34] <momomomomo> Rinthe: anything else that I send your way will really just be me googling
[16:43:45] <momomomomo> I'd do some searching around this to see what others have done
[16:44:19] <Rinthe> what should i be searching for
[16:44:23] <Rinthe> like the terms
[16:47:09] <eobet> shoky: http://pastie.org/7998486 better?
[16:47:13] <CocoStorm> http://jsfiddle.net/ECLFk/
[16:47:19] <Rinthe> i cant find much on analytics and pushstate
[16:47:23] <CocoStorm> how do I fix that? it keeps nudging the other thing
[16:47:39] <shoky> mcflurry: that's not a list of browsers, it's your browser's user-agent string
[16:47:56] <Rinthe> does anyone here know if when i use pushstate and .load() to load a new page into a div, would the analytics code register on the new page? or do i have to push myself
[16:47:58] <eobet> or not… it doesn't preload images :(
[16:48:15] <shoky> eobet: that should be .css('background-image')  not .attr()   but like i said: i dont think that's a useful "preloading" technique
[16:48:36] <shoky> eobet: if the images are already present in the DOM with the right src..
[16:49:49] <eobet> shoky: I have a few display: none images as part of a slideshow, and a few background-images that only shows up on :active and those are the ones I'm trying to reach
[16:52:37] <shoky> eobet: gotcha.. actually that way may be ok, donno why its not working for you, i'd need to see it live
[16:56:23] <eobet> shoky: http://www.omakadesign.com/ …still see flashes of white, so I gather it's not working
[17:02:49] <shoky> eobet: first of all  the ones with background-image  wont work because it returns e.g.   url(bla.jpg)   and that's not a valid image src
[17:03:05] <shoky> eobet: so that gives errors:  GET http://www.omakadesign.com/url(http://www.omakadesign.com/img/menu-products.svg) 404 (Not Found)
[17:03:57] <shoky> eobet: but for the others it seems to be working, i think the white flash is caused by something else
[17:07:19] <shoky> eobet:  it's the .appendTo causing it
[17:07:54] <shoky> eobet: you need to do the .appendTo only after the animation is finished
[17:08:10] <shoky> eobet: e.g. with a callback on the .fadeOut
[17:09:13] <eobet> ah… can I use .delay(1500).appendTo('.slideshow'); instead you think?
[17:09:51] <shoky> eobet: no, just:  .fadeOut(1500, function() { $(this).appendTo('.slideshow') }).next().fadeIn(1500);
[17:11:14] <CocoStorm> hey guys, how do I fix this, the #box2 div keeps moving places when the other is being toggled http://jsfiddle.net/ECLFk/
[17:12:31] <eobet> shoky: wow, that even removed the .end() call… neat solution, thanks!
[17:13:11] <tylercipriani> CocoStorm: try adding clear:left; to #box2
[17:13:13] <eobet> shoky: i'm replacing the credit url with your nick :)
[17:13:53] <shoky> eobet: heh ;]
[17:14:24] <CocoStorm> tylercipriani, oh yeah, that worked. thanks.  So how did that fix it? what was happening?
[17:16:56] <tylercipriani> CocoStorm: #box1 was pushing #box2 down to the next line, removing #box1 caused it to move up to the previous line
[17:17:32] <CocoStorm> tylercipriani, I see
[17:17:54] <CocoStorm> thanks :)
[17:18:06] <tylercipriani> CocoStorm: yezzur
[17:19:31] <CocoStorm> so clear: left allows itself to float to the left of the other dive tylercipriani ?
[17:21:51] <tylercipriani> CocoStorm: adding clear: left means that an element cannot be to the left of floating elements that proceed it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clear
[17:22:10] <CocoStorm> I see
[17:39:01] <Anna> Bonsoir
[17:40:45] <Anna> can you help me guys
[17:40:54] <Anna> i got an error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'element' of undefined
[17:40:55] <shoky> Anna: give a link to your site
[17:41:12] <Anna> hi shoky
[17:41:13] <Anna> http://www.unlock-all-gsm.com/deblocage/desimlockage-telephones-portable/code-deblocage-alcatel/
[17:44:31] <Anna> shoky it worked fine i just did the WP update and ooops got this error
[17:47:19] <jtreminio> Evening all. I want to affect a new element added by append(). I want to have it modified by select2 (http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/). For the life of me I can't figure out how to get this library to pick up on a new element, though. Any help?
[17:48:52] <banister`shop> what would be the meaning/use of a promise() from a hover ? e.g $("div").hover(...).promise().then(...) ?
[17:48:57] <banister`shop> is there a use for it?
[17:50:45] <Anna> okay shoky
[17:52:13] <Anna> it says line N° 5 contains an error !! and i'm not a developper
[17:53:48] <shoky> Anna: you're including jquery-ui twice
[17:54:11] <shoky> Anna:  both 1.8.22  and then 1.9.2
[17:54:19] <shoky> Anna: or i guess its one of your WP plugins or someshit
[17:54:30] <shoky> Anna: but that's causing the error that im seeing
[17:55:58] <Anna> yes right
[17:56:25] <Anna> someone fixed the issue befor
[17:57:06] <Anna> shoky is there any solution
[17:57:21] <shoky> Anna: yes. include only one version of jquery-ui
[17:57:32] <shoky> and.. just once :P
[17:58:02] <Anna> i asked the theme devlopper they said ask the plugin dev
[17:58:29] <Anna> so no matter i bought both of them
[18:00:19] <shoky> banister`shop: that indeed looks weird.. that .promise() gets a promise for all running animations on the element(s)
[18:00:42] <Anna> shoky otherwise there is an issu
[18:01:35] <shoky> Anna: i dont really understand what you're saying ;p
[18:02:06] <Anna> shoky : how can i fix this prob
[18:02:12] <shoky> Anna:  i told you how
[18:02:18] <shoky> Anna: you might have better luck in #wordpress
[18:02:44] <Anna> okay thank you anyways
[18:03:13] <shoky> Bonne Soirֳ©e
[18:03:17] <shoky> eek
[18:05:01] <aaas> ok i have no idea why i cant find this info, but I want to load some json content from ajax and load it with a jquery.ui 'slide' effect.   I have everything done except how to do the load() (or show(), or whatever) to get it to load and display the affect.  my json data is data[i].data, what now: http://pastebin.com/Zbhy9uQC
[18:05:32] <aaas> i should say my new content (already parsed json) is in data[i].data
[18:07:18] <aaas> so maybe i want html() as opposed to load() since i alreday have the data?
[18:09:36] <shoky> aaas: .load() is for loading a url, not an html string
[18:10:16] <aaas> ok that's probalby part of my problem
[18:10:32] <aaas> so probably html(content).effect('slide')?
[18:10:45] <shoky> i guess
[18:10:55] <aaas> im trying...think im getting closer
[18:10:56] <shoky> (donno the API for effect though )
[18:11:02] <shoky> but yeah, html instead of load
[18:11:24] <aaas> k thanks

[18:52:12] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, I have a button that when pressed hides a div and shows another div.  Another button that hides that div and opens the one that was hidden.  But if I press both at the same time they both appear! :O
[18:52:16] <CocoStorm> how do I avoid that?
[18:56:46] <Rinthe> i can do $('#post-view').load(url + ' #content, footer', function() {} to only load #content and footer with .load() how do i do that with $.ajax?
[19:02:02] <affine> anyone know of a good plugin that allows you to pan and zoom around arbitrary contents, without also panning and zooming the parent div?
[19:02:28] <affine> I'm looking for something I can put a lot of draggables into and then pan and zoom around the canvas with the mouse
[19:02:35] <affine> of course I could just make the parent div super massive
[19:05:59] <affine> actually, I'll just do that :)
[19:06:22] <not_mike> how can I make it so that the image appears on hover of the block and not the text? ->http://jsfiddle.net/Y9V8e/962/
[19:06:36] <not_mike> woops, not that link
[19:06:41] <not_mike> http://jsfiddle.net/Y9V8e/963/
[19:07:30] <affine> not_mike, please explain more
[19:07:54] <not_mike> Right now, the google image appears when you hover over the text
[19:08:10] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, how do I avoid having the two boxes appearing at the same time when i click one button right before clicking the next? http://jsfiddle.net/LnpqW/
[19:08:15] <not_mike> I would like to completely omit the text and have the google image appear on hover of a box, affine
[19:08:25] <not_mike> without getting rid of the 'a' tag
[19:08:39] <affine> not_mike, display:none; and then onhover change the display css?
[19:08:58] <not_mike> I've done that before, more problems than I have right now
[19:09:19] <not_mike> I was advised to used visibility:hidden instead of that, actually, and that fixed a problem that I had
[19:09:22] <not_mike> heres a new problem
[19:11:08] <Rinthe> anyone?
[19:16:37] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, how do I avoid having the two boxes appearing at the same time when i click one button right before clicking the next? http://jsfiddle.net/LnpqW/
[19:17:27] <Rinthe> i can do $('#post-view').load(url + ' #content, footer', function() {} to only load #content and footer with .load() how do i do that with $.ajax?
[19:17:46] <shoky> Rinthe:  $.ajax({url: url, dataType:'html'}).done(function(html) { var d = $('<div>').append( $.parseHTML(html) );  $('#post-view').html( d.find('#content, footer') ); })
[19:18:56] <Rinthe> shoky: whoa thats complicated haha
[19:19:22] <shoky> Rinthe: welp that's what .load() does for you
[19:19:30] <tw2113> not really that complicated
[19:19:43] <shoky> and yeah, not complicated ;p
[19:20:06] <Rinthe> shoky: my problem is that the content in #content has some javascript, when i get it through .load() it doesnt work, is there a way around that or do i have to use ajax
[19:20:21] <Rinthe> lol to you guys
[19:21:02] <shoky> Rinthe:  it's best if you load html snippets with no scripts.. something simple you can put in a div
[19:21:25] <shoky> Rinthe: otherwise it just gets real annoying
[19:21:47] <Rinthe> shoky: well i have to load this script, its for disqus comments
[19:22:10] <lenswipee> shoky: how do i display an img dynamically using jQuery without adding it to the html dom, more like a dialog?
[19:22:54] <shoky> Rinthe: then load the script separately with getScript or something, or just load it normally from the initial html with regular <script src=...>
[19:23:32] <shoky> lenswipee: you can't display anything without adding it to the dom... except alerts maybe ;p
[19:23:48] <Rinthe> shoky: cant load it initially, it has to be where i want the comments to be
[19:24:09] <tw2113> reasons to hate Disqus: must be where the comments will be
[19:24:14] <Rinthe> shoky: im not familiar with getScript, what does it do?
[19:24:18] <Rinthe> lol
[19:24:20] <shoky> Rinthe: guess ...
[19:24:36] <tw2113> it tells you how it met your mother, in your father's voice
[19:24:40] <Rinthe> o this? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[19:24:56] <lenswipee> shoky: ok, how to remove the title bar in a dialog. I want to put a loader in the dialog. Don't know of an easier way.
[19:25:11] <Rinthe> does it have to be in a file?
[19:25:25] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, how do I avoid having the two boxes appearing at the same time when i click one button right before clicking the next? http://jsfiddle.net/LnpqW/
[19:27:12] <shoky> lenswipee: with css
[19:35:18] <Rinthe> shoky: is there a reason why you used .done() instead of success function() within $ajax?
[19:36:24] <CocoStorm> shoky, Hey guys, how do I avoid having the two boxes appearing at the same time when i click one button right before clicking the next? http://jsfiddle.net/LnpqW/
[19:37:45] <shoky> Rinthe: it's the same thing. done() is just nicer since you can chain them and add multiple of them, and it's the same API that other stuff in jquery uses (deferreds/promises if you wanna read about..)
[19:38:20] <Rinthe> shoky: any advantages to using the same API?
[19:38:52] <shoky> Rinthe: less to memorize ;]  and it's more flexible, there's more to that API than just .done()

[19:44:41] <CocoStorm> pff
[19:44:52] <relipse>  does anyone have any ideas for displaying a modal ajax display (for example you edit an item and want to wait for ajax response, how can i display a somewhat visible ajax loading gif?
[19:45:01] <Rinthe> cocostorm: http://api.jquery.com/stop/ maybe
[19:45:53] <Rinthe> cocostorm: well not everyone checks this every second
[19:46:15] <Rinthe> plus they're helping for free, haev some patience
[19:48:13] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, I've been asking the same question for an hour.  If that's not being patient I'm not sure what is!
[19:48:58] <Rinthe> Coco: maybe they just don't want to answer it
[19:49:11] <Rinthe> i did what i can, im not 100% sure tho
[19:50:16] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, thanks
[19:50:51] <tw2113> i lack both serious and sarcastic answers, so i'm just shutting up
[19:50:53] <CocoStorm> but i'm not sure what to do
[19:50:58] <tw2113> plus i have Game of Thrones soon
[19:51:18] <CocoStorm> with the .stop()
[19:51:29] <Rinthe> CocoStorm: stop the animation i assume
[19:51:49] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, yes but how does it know when to stop it
[19:52:32] <CocoStorm> it needs to stop if the user clicks the other button before this animation has finished
[19:53:02] <Rinthe> the animations are terrible, get rid of them
[19:53:59] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, what do you suggest instead?
[19:54:43] <Rinthe> coco: no animation would be than what you have hahah
[19:54:58] <Rinthe> coco: maybe noone is helping you cause ur shit looks ugly as fuck
[19:55:05] <Rinthe> dont mean to be rude
[19:55:15] <Rinthe> and really messy
[19:56:19] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, it's jfiddle, i don't have the whole thing on there so of course it's going to look a bit messy/ugly
[19:56:42] <Rinthe> coco: haah i know im just messing with ya
[19:57:19] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, it's fine.  I don't take offense, i'm an android/java dev ( real programmer) not a web developer
[19:57:27] <CocoStorm> so you can say what you want
[19:57:39] <CocoStorm> Web development is bullshit anyway

[19:59:12] <tw2113> it's called life
[19:59:20] <tw2113> now go choke on too much salt :D
[19:59:40] <Rinthe> id rather choke on popcorn
[20:00:00] <CocoStorm> No when someone who doesn't know shit talks shit about some one else's work then they should really put them in their places
[20:00:13] <CocoStorm> or you fail at life
[20:00:29] <CocoStorm> Rinthe is probably 15 or something anyway
[20:00:30] <tw2113> yes, lets all take the well beaten muddy road
[20:00:35] <CocoStorm> he has  a lot to learn
[20:00:54] <shoky> CocoStorm: now it's your turn to stop
[20:00:57] <Rinthe> coco i thought u werent offended, sounds like you're
[20:00:59] <shoky> no pun intended
[20:01:01] <Rinthe> im sorry if you're
[20:01:08] <tw2113> everyone always has stuff to learn
[20:01:10] <Rinthe> i dont think before i talk
[20:01:15] <Rinthe> i say whats i my mind
[20:01:16] <tw2113> the moment you stop learning in life, what's the point
[20:01:17] <Rinthe> or type
[20:02:22] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, it's okay eric hu. just be careful what you say and where you say it
[20:02:38] <Rinthe> am i supposed to be scared? lol
[20:02:50] <Rinthe> check out my websites yo
[20:02:52] <Rinthe> ericpaints.it
[20:02:57] <Rinthe> i designed it all myself
[20:03:14] <harrymoreno> are there any known plugins that do image tagging like how Facebook lets you tag people with a little square?
[20:03:15] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, looks like wordpress
[20:03:19] <Rinthe> yup
[20:03:25] <Rinthe> designed the theme obviously
[20:03:33] <Rinthe> im more of a designer than developer
[20:03:34] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, amateur
[20:03:42] <Rinthe> nah
[20:03:42] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, you're more of a cunt
[20:03:45] <Rinthe> a nub
[20:04:37] <Susan> Be nice.
[20:04:39] <CocoStorm> fucking chink
[20:04:51] <shoky> CocoStorm: we get it. can you please stop?
[20:05:37] <Rinthe> shoky: say i loadeded all the stuff into a div, without the script part, can i add the script back into where it needs to be and would it work?
[20:05:59] <shoky> CocoStorm: fwiw i've been trying to make your animations work right for the last 20 min, not much success working with those hide/show effects
[20:06:16] <shoky> CocoStorm: that's why i didnt reply
[20:06:56] <CocoStorm> shoky, right well I just wished you had told me that earlier so i would've just waited rather than see you answer other people#s questions which seemed like i was being ignored
[20:07:12] <CocoStorm> and that hu fucker had to get rude which just pissed me off even more
[20:07:27] <tw2113> <popcorn>
[20:07:40] <Rinthe> chill man chillllllllllllll
[20:08:40] <shoky> CocoStorm: i'm not here to make you feel noticed or loved. people will answer your questions when they feel like it
[20:09:21] <shoky> CocoStorm: and please stop swearing and making racist remarks
[20:11:13] <shoky> Rinthe: i'm not really sure what it means that the script "needs" to be there. also i donno anything about disqus or their scripts
[20:12:19] <Rinthe> shoky: http://pastebin.com/YSn3iBJ3 basically, this code you insert it wherever you want your comments to show, this basically shows the whole comment form with comments and everything. so i have to put it where i want to show them
[20:12:49] <CocoStorm> shoky, I don't expect anything from people here but that doesn't mean they should have a lack of respect and that includes not answering questions for an hour and being told that my work looks " looks ugly as fuck"
[20:12:54] <shoky> Rinthe: that script doesn't need to be anywhere special
[20:13:28] <Rinthe> coco: dude i was trying to tell you, people are here on their own time and they dont have to answer anythingi f they don't want to. as for my comment i already said sorry
[20:15:40] <Rinthe> shoky: shit, you might be right
[20:15:43] <Rinthe> wtf was i thinking
[20:16:06] <tw2113> a question up for debate
[20:16:17] <Rinthe> tw2113: get some popcorn
[20:16:19] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, don't try and tell me what I already know chik
[20:16:21] <CocoStorm> *chink
[20:16:38] <tw2113> you misspelled "human"
[20:17:12] <CocoStorm> sorry *human with an abornamlly small penis
[20:17:54] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, you're ugly as fuck
[20:18:09] <shoky> CocoStorm: stop now
[20:18:44] <Rinthe> shoky: ok i moved those code to the end of the page, but it's not loading my disqus comments for some reason
[20:19:07] <Rinthe> i put <div id="disqus_thread"></div> where i want the comment to show, not the script
[20:19:10] <shoky> shrugs
[20:19:25] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, fucking noob, you might as well give up
[20:19:31] <CocoStorm> stick to painting
[20:20:12] <CocoStorm> Rinthe, you have nothing giong for you in terms of programming

[21:10:13] <Rinthe> shoky: thanks! :)
[21:13:21] <lenswipee> Rinthe: Finally worked it out. Thanks for the css tips.
[21:13:35] <Rinthe> lenswipee: np!
[21:32:33] * JohnnyCache is in love with jQuery. <3
[21:33:39] <Rinthe> $('#post-view').load(url + ' #content, footer', function() { is there a way to select and find elements in the #content that's being loaded?
[21:56:14] <Cork> Rinthe: just make a selection in the target element
[21:56:24] <Cork> Rinthe: it should be there by the time the callback happens
[21:57:05] <Cork> Rinthe: btw, i'm quite sure you can't do ", footer" in the element selector for the .load
[21:57:32] <Cork> it only takes id's
[21:57:33] <Rinthe> Cork: i can, it works
[21:58:00] <Cork> hmm might be a change in newer versions then
[21:59:04] <Cork> ah, yes it supports any selector in there now days; nice
[21:59:41] <Cork> (well the entire feature of selecting parts in the sent content is kinda horrible, but...=
[22:00:00] <aaas> with this code: http://pastebin.com/f9GSyy1b  my .hide() animation doesn't fire if the html().effect() line is there....i think there's something fundamental im misunderstanding here
[22:01:24] <Cork> aaas: yes, animation is async
[22:01:47] <Cork> you would have to have the last line inside the callback on line 13
[22:02:08] <aaas> ah thanks
[22:02:30] <Cork> aaas: though how would the element slide animate when it's hidden?
[22:02:50] <Cork> basically, i'm not sure what it is you're trying to do
[22:03:10] <Cork> are you looking for show('slide') ?
[22:03:12] <aaas> well i think slide is the way it's hidden
[22:03:39] <aaas> it seems to be kinda working now i think
[22:04:08] <aaas> so slide to hide, then empty the wrapper div, then fill with new content, then slide back in
[22:04:09] <Cork> aaas: effect is for making things wobble or flicker in place
[22:04:17] <Cork> aaas: no need to empty
[22:04:22] <Cork> .html() does that for you
[22:04:25] <aaas> slide is a jqeury.ui thing
[22:04:30] <aaas> ah
[22:05:00] <Cork> aaas: i meant $(argumentWrapper).hide('slide', function() { $(argumentWrapper).html(newContent).show('slide'); });
[22:05:10] <Cork> looks like it's what you're looking for
[22:05:38] <aaas> yes i think so...still trying to understand the async part
[22:05:50] <aaas> so it waits until?
[22:05:52] <Cork> (notice the effect > show change)
[22:05:53] <aaas> until...
[22:06:04] <Cork> aaas: it waits until the first animation is complete
[22:06:12] <Cork> and it's not show that needs it, its .html()
[22:06:21] <Cork> hide and show is async
[22:06:25] <Cork> .html() isn't
[22:06:35] <aaas> so by having the html line after...
[22:06:35] <Cork> so what you did was:
[22:06:51] <Cork> you queued the animation for hide(), then replaced the content in the page
[22:07:12] <Cork> and then you made the hide('slide').show('slide') animation
[22:07:17] <Cork> by using the callback
[22:07:34] <Cork> you delay .html() until the hide has finished
[22:07:40] <aaas> ok
[22:07:46] <aaas> and if the line was outside the callback
[22:07:49] <aaas> what is the logic then
[22:07:54] <Cork> async
[22:08:04] <aaas> so hide is queued
[22:08:10] <Cork> async code runs as closest on the next browser tick
[22:08:10] <aaas> but doesn't fire
[22:08:20] <Cork> means after you're function has finished
[22:08:33] <Cork> aaas: it fires by a timer
[22:08:36] <aaas> but why isn't the function finished after the callback
[22:08:38] <aaas> ah
[22:08:57] <aaas> so sort of some race condition type thing going on
[22:09:03] <Cork> no not race
[22:09:28] <aaas> well if it's a timer...i could set a long pause on the other one
[22:09:30] <Cork> as you're actually guaranteed that all code outside the callback will finish before the callback happens
[22:09:53] <aaas> but i thought you said it was a timer?
[22:09:54] <lenswipee> hi, anyone know why my overflow-y: auto is not working in my dialog?
[22:09:55] <Cork> sure if you added an additional timer sure
[22:10:05] <Cork> aaas: the animation yes, not for the code outside
[22:10:21] <Cork> aaas: javascript is single threaded
[22:10:28] <bambanx> wassap
[22:10:29] <Cork> two lines of code can't run at the same time
[22:10:38] <aaas> well i didnt mean it literally
[22:10:41] <Cork> ?p @ lenswipee
[22:10:41] <bot-t> lenswipee, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:10:42] <aaas> but
[22:10:48] <aaas> so hide doesn't fire until ...
[22:10:50] <aaas> the timer
[22:10:54] <aaas> and code after
[22:11:18] <Cork> aaas: jquery has an internal setInterval timer that creates ticks
[22:11:33] <aaas> ok
[22:11:34] <Cork> aaas: at each of those ticks jquery makes the next step in the animation
[22:11:48] <Cork> that is needed for you to actually see the animation
[22:11:53] <aaas> ok
[22:12:06] <Cork> else javascript would just run the math from start to end and THEN the browser would actually draw it
[22:12:21] <aaas> ah
[22:12:27] <Cork> when the animation hits the end the callback is called
[22:12:41] <Cork> so it's not called at each tick, the animate step does that
[22:13:13] <aaas> what isn't called? hide?
[22:13:19] <Cork> aaas: bascially a browser draws in between javascript stack calls
[22:13:27] <Cork> aaas: the callback from hide
[22:13:31] <aaas> ah
[22:13:47] <Cork> aaas: it's called when the needed number of ticks to complete the animation has been processed
[22:14:29] <aaas> so if i had enough commands after the hide stuff then i might actually see it in the order i expected?
[22:14:36] <Cork> no
[22:14:47] <Cork> cause the first tick happens after your function ends
[22:14:54] <Cork> remember single thread
[22:15:04] <Cork> can't do two things at once
[22:15:30] <aaas> so just tyring to get this straight...the conditions in which hide fires is when ....>?
[22:15:51] <aaas> well i guess i mean display
[22:15:55] <aaas> when i actually see it
[22:15:57] <Cork> when javascript isn't active, and the browser has time to fire a timer callback
[22:16:21] <aaas> ok...and in my old broken code that was when?
[22:16:29] <Cork> the first part is what guarantees your code later in the function will run into the callback
[22:16:48] <Cork> aaas: at earliest after .html() was called
[22:17:06] <Cork> as .effect is async too
[22:17:08] <aaas> becasue that's when it has time to fire a timer callback?
[22:17:20] <Cork> no cause that was the last sync call in the function
[22:17:41] <Cork> meaning the function ends after the .html() call
[22:17:52] <aaas> ah so html is sync so it syncs everything up?
[22:18:10] <Cork> it means it isn't using ajax or timers
[22:18:21] <Cork> so it doen't wait for a browser timer event
[22:18:26] <Cork> or network event
[22:18:58] <aaas> yes but i mean when it hit's html() that's when all the async things run?
[22:19:04] <aaas> that were queued
[22:19:14] <Cork> no, not as those are animations
[22:19:22] <Cork> it's when the first tick in the animation happens
[22:19:32] <Cork> it depends on how long the animation takes
[22:19:50] <Cork> other code sections might run in between each animation ticks and so on
[22:20:14] <aaas> is there a guide/book i can read about this?
[22:20:27] <Cork> there prob is
[22:20:55] <Cork> you could try googling about javascript setTimeout and async/sync and things like that
[22:21:11] <Cork> i'm SURE there are loads of tutorials and things like that about it
[22:21:34] <aaas> ok thanks
[22:36:41] <Rinthe> window.history.pushState('', title, $(this).data('href')); if i got the title, isnt it supposed to change the title when i click pushstate?
[22:36:50] <Rinthe> when i pushstate*
[22:38:59] <Cork> Rinthe: i think it should ya
[22:39:12] <Rinthe> Cork: it's not!:(
[22:41:21] <Cork> Rinthe: some browsers doesn't support it yet
[22:41:39] <Rinthe> which supports it? im on chrome
[22:41:54] <Cork> well not sure if any support it
[22:42:04] <Cork> it's mainly there for future use
[22:43:58] <Rinthe> i see
[22:49:43] <platinoid732> I have the following code http://pastebin.com/jYc2wg4X that loops multiple times to display a form. This form has a textfield with<name= "hours"> How can I differentiate between the various text fields to choose the ones which have some data entered and update in a database.
[22:55:30] <ezakimak> is there any formatting function to wrap long lines via <br> insertion, or truncate with ellipses over a threshold?
[22:55:35] <Cork> platinoid732: as long as the form is written correctly (like how it should be for normal http post) just use .serialize() or .serializeArray()
[22:56:01] <Cork> ezakimak: why not just set the element to wrap the text?
[22:56:19] <ezakimak> considering that, but i think i may want to truncate actually
[22:58:26] <Cork> ezakimak: then just use the eclipse css option :)
[23:02:04] <shoky> sun { eclipse: total }
[23:02:19] <ezakimak> i assume he meant elipsis
[23:02:23] <shoky> :P
[23:06:40] <Cork> opps ya, i always mix those up >_<
[23:20:42] <boytoy> What's up fellas? Trying this supersimple width measuring of a label and an input - http://jsfiddle.net/MDrnV/ - can anyone spot what I've done wrong?
[23:21:51] <Tulga> this channel related bootstrap typeahead issue? I have problem.
[23:25:47] <Cork> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/MDrnV/1/ ?
[23:27:07] <Tulga> bootstrap typeahead giving duplicated results when typing fast. how to solve it?
[23:28:17] <boytoy> Cork: Oh I'd love to but unfortunately the inline-block thingie would mess up this slider thingie
[23:28:22] <coldhead> type slower
[23:28:37] <Cork> boytoy: why?
[23:28:50] <Cork> looks fine here
[23:28:51] <boytoy> but I think I nailed it, by measuring the label and input and then adding them up: http://jsfiddle.net/MDrnV/2/
[23:29:14] <Tulga> coldhead: most people type very quick
[23:29:21] <Cork> boytoy: just... why do you need to do it that way?
[23:29:31] <boytoy> Cork: like each .container is a slide that u can play with.. they have this Prev Next button etc.
[23:29:32] <Cork> why use js for css styling
[23:29:41] <Cork> boytoy: so?
[23:29:57] <Cork> boytoy: i still don't see why you need to use js to do the work of css
[23:30:58] <MickRip> yeah, styling with js is kinda like doing html with document.write :P
[23:31:03] <boytoy> Cork: yeah ur right, sec
[23:31:04] <Cork> boytoy: i see no difference between this one and your js based one http://jsfiddle.net/MDrnV/3/
[23:31:05] <Rinthe> YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY DONE
[23:31:10] <Rinthe> thx for the help guys
[23:31:36] <boytoy> Cork: yeah i didnt include the slider plugin but im pretty sure display inline would mess up its juju
[23:31:44] <boytoy> gonna test just to be sure though
[23:34:55] <boytoy> Cork: im with u 100% though, one should never get js to do the job of css
[23:35:00] <boytoy> that is WRONG WRONG WRONG
[23:35:04] <boytoy> sing with me now
[23:55:42] <fabioportieri> morning
