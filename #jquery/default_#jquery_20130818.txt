[00:16:25] <chovy> is this valid? $('body').off('.foo, .bar')
[00:19:08] <Andrew_R> chovy: no, .off() is the opposite of .on(), which are replacements for .unbind() and .bind()
[00:19:14] <Andrew_R> what are you trying to do?
[00:19:30] <chovy> Andrew_R: just remove two namespaces at once.
[00:19:47] <Andrew_R> remove the classes?
[00:20:34] <Andrew_R> $('body').removeClass('foo bar');
[00:20:42] <Andrew_R> http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[00:21:03] <chovy> Andrew_R: no. event namespaces
[00:21:20] <chovy> .on('click.myNamespace') can be removed with .off('.myNamespace')
[00:21:54] <chovy> it would unbind all events that use .myNamespace
[00:22:17] <Andrew_R> oh sorry... I just looked at the docs and it says they are space separated, not comma separated
[00:54:10] <chovy> i see
[00:54:20] <chovy> i didn't see that in the docs
[01:41:55] <thump_> hey, anyone know where i can put a pdf online for people to download?
[02:06:15] <inthl> using .next().find('.classname') I can search for an element with class "classname" right after that element - but how could one search for the very next occurance (no matter where in the source code) of that class? .next() works for the next element only
[02:06:41] <inthl> in my case it may occur a few elements later, or immediately after that one
[02:13:39] <boytoy> inthl: im probably wrong but what about .closest()?
[02:15:45] <inthl> hm doesn't check out here
[02:18:31] <dabear> boytoy: .nextAll(".foo"), but that only searches siblings. if you wanna search siblings of grand parents, you would have to create a custom logic for that
[02:24:08] <boytoy> dabear: ah ok cool thanks for that
[02:24:26] <boytoy> go bruins

[03:32:28] <impi> hey guys, i hope you're having a great weekend! i got a question, in terms of responsive frameworks? which one is better? i like isotope and the way it moves elements around to fit the space available on the screen, but i also like bootstrap from twitter? i dont know enough to make a desision - maybe there are some guys here that worked with both?
[03:33:47] <impi> http://bootstrap-code.tumblr.com/post/50489924502/bootstrap-and-isotope
[03:33:55] <impi> i see people use both...maybe thats the holy graile?
[03:36:24] <jop008> how to change the black background on the tabs like locatie http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/Zf5Dj/2/
[03:37:18] <jop008> the black background should be white
[03:44:16] <fooman2011> Hello. I have a small window. I would like to open a bigger window (containing a list of items) to select an item and then this selected item appears into my small window. Could you tell me what is the best way to do that ?
[03:49:31] <jop008> Is there a site where you can convert html to javascript string?
[03:51:04] <jop008> http://accessify.com/tools-and-wizards/developer-tools/html-javascript-convertor/
[03:51:19] <impi> maybe just set the html as a string ie var html = "<div class='lol'>&nbsp</div>"; then use jQuery().html(html);
[03:56:40] <jop008> how to injext element in the dom as first element appendto is doing this at the end
[04:11:57] <jop008> I use prepend but the dom is not rendered completely
[04:12:02] <jop008> how to do that?
[04:19:12] <CasW> Hey guys, I want to snap elements in jQueryUI draggable, but with a fixed margin between the elements, is this possible or do I have to change jqueryui for it?
[04:19:41] <impi> .prepend
[04:24:42] <pymaniac> #join crypto
[04:30:07] <CasW> Yeah, I notice that it snaps earlier if you have a larger margin, so isn't this actually a bug?
[04:52:01] <bibi23> I'd like to get the concatenation of 2 checkbox values (or an empty string if it's not selected), this one "var a = $('#id:checked').val() + $('#id2:checked').val()" returns "value1undefined" if the 2nd is not selected, how can I convert "undefined" to empty string?
[04:53:02] <doug65536> biberao: ($('#id2:checked').val() || '')
[04:53:54] <doug65536> bibi23: oops ^^
[04:55:17] <bibi23> doug65536: great thx for the tip!
[04:57:55] <doug65536> bibi23: sure, no problem. if the left hand argument of || evaulates to something implicitly convertible to false (like undefined) then it evaluates the right hand side. && and || operators return the last value evaluated
[05:02:08] <bibi23> doug65536: yep I know about those && and || I just didn't tought about them on this context :) (because most of the time i use them on if conditions)
[05:05:55] <boytoy> sup fam
[05:05:59] <boytoy> anybody familiar with jquery embedly?
[05:08:20] <doug65536> boytoy: no, but ask your question anyway
[05:08:50] <boytoy> doug65536: swell!
[05:08:54] <boytoy> How do I unhide my page after my Embedly autoembeds are fully loaded? http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/14/edit -- attempting to use jQuery Embedly's .done: https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery#client
[05:09:25] <boytoy> I'm not all too familiar with Deferred Objects so.
[05:10:32] <doug65536> boytoy: are you familiar with $.ajax? it is the same API. embedly returns an object that you can use later to get the result
[05:11:23] <doug65536> boytoy: so if I call my_deferred.done(function() { ... stuff ...});  *before* the result is ready, it will setup a callback to be called when it is done
[05:11:35] <doug65536> and if it is done already, ... stuff ... runs immediately
[05:11:41] <doug65536> with the .done method
[05:12:19] <boytoy> nice yeah that makes a lot of sense
[05:13:13] <doug65536> boytoy: note that .done returns whether or not the operation is done. don't expect it to wait
[05:13:27] <doug65536> boytoy: returns immediately*
[05:13:52] <jop008> I want to insert html at the end of my page node how to do this? I tried append
[05:15:14] <doug65536> jop008: you mean some node with attribute data-role="page" ?
[05:15:30] <jop008> yes that is my page node
[05:15:41] <jop008> and I want to isnert footer html at bottom
[05:16:49] <doug65536> jop008: can you show the line of code that you tried to use to append?
[05:17:18] <doug65536> $('div[data-role="page"]').append(my_html) should work
[05:17:37] <doug65536> assuming you don't already have a better selector for the page node
[05:17:57] <jop008>   alert (strVar)       $('#page').append(strVar);     $("#page").trigger('create');
[05:18:23] <doug65536> ; missing after alert
[05:18:30] <jop008> but this ia after the last element of page it must be at the last element
[05:18:57] <jop008> alert (strVar)      $('#page').append(strVar);    $("#page").trigger('create');
[05:19:04] <boytoy> doug65536: at http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/17/edit are you able to narrow down the problem area? (i removed a lot of irrelevant code from earlier jsbins)
[05:20:17] <doug65536> jop008: assuming your page node has id="page" and strVar is something valid, that should work. did you examine the DOM in the debugger and see if the problem is the append or the trigger?
[05:23:18] <doug65536> boytoy: embedly isn't loading properly
[05:23:58] <doug65536> boytoy: I think... "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'done' (line 7)"  ... still looking
[05:24:31] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/n3dtB/40/
[05:24:35] <boytoy> doug65536: It's loading, note you must disable body's display: none
[05:24:56] <doug65536> boytoy: the script crashes long before that matters though
[05:25:05] <boytoy> doug65536: The thing is I want to turn display back on only when all the embeds are loaded (otherwise the page will load first, and there'll be a slight delay until things come through from embedly)
[05:26:06] <boytoy> doug65536: im checking now.. but it seems to work: http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/17/edit
[05:27:34] <doug65536> boytoy: jsbin makes the debugger useless
[05:28:05] <boytoy> oh.. i didnt know that..
[05:28:09] <doug65536> boytoy: the link you gave me spammed the console with crashes
[05:28:30] <boytoy> i updated http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/17/edit the second time though
[05:28:36] <doug65536> yes that one is good
[05:28:54] <boytoy> (took out the part which converts the embeds to thumbnails for a better experience on mobile)
[05:30:05] <doug65536> jop008: it has display:none
[05:30:26] <doug65536> jop008: line 3
[05:30:56] <jop008> stupid me
[05:31:34] <doug65536> jop008: na, you are probably starting to jump to the conclusion that you have a jqm problem :)
[05:33:07] <jop008> Thanks worked fine now
[05:33:31] <jop008> sometimes tunnel vision
[05:42:23] <bonhoeffer> is there a simple way to make a form field full screen?
[05:42:28] <doug65536> boytoy: so where's the problem. did you fix it already?
[05:42:33] <bonhoeffer> hopefully compatible with bootstrap
[05:43:01] <boytoy> doug65536: nope still looking :)
[05:43:21] <boytoy> doug65536: i dont know why $('body').css('display', 'block'); inside .done wont get executed
[05:43:22] <doug65536> boytoy: what's wrong though? how do I reproduce your issue
[05:43:33] <doug65536> ok
[05:43:36] <boytoy> doug65536: theres probably some clues in what you said earlier so
[05:43:43] <sacho> what makes you think it won't get executed
[05:44:17] <doug65536> "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'done' (line 5)"
[05:44:32] <boytoy> hmmm yeah
[05:44:47] <boytoy> im not following the example at https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery#client properly i guess
[05:46:28] <doug65536> boytoy: the github calls extract, not embedly
[05:49:57] <doug65536> boytoy: I'm going to recreate in jsfiddle so debugger isn't screwed
[05:51:56] <boytoy> doug65536: i'd appreciate that, thanks
[05:53:18] <doug65536> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/d7QGu/1/
[05:57:13] <boytoy> doug65536: did it get done at your end?
[05:57:25] <doug65536> no
[05:58:17] <doug65536> boytoy: why does you link to their docs show something entirely different from your code?
[05:58:29] <doug65536> var deferred = $.embedly.extract(['http://embed.ly.... ?
[05:58:41] <doug65536> your*
[05:59:51] <doug65536> boytoy: $.embedely doesn't return a deferred object
[06:00:12] <doug65536> boytoy: there is no .done on the returned object
[06:00:33] <doug65536> boytoy: which example are you going by on that docs page?
[06:00:42] <boytoy> doug65536: well i asked embedly support for the best way to set css display to block after all embeds are loaded
[06:00:47] <boytoy> doug65536: one of the guys there pointed me to that link
[06:00:47] <doug65536> the one you link is nothing at all like yours
[06:00:59] <boytoy> ive written back but probably wont get a reply until late next week :)
[06:01:07] <doug65536> ok, that's something to go on, I'll look at that
[06:01:45] <doug65536> instead of saying, "when I try to turn this key, it won't turn", instead say, "I'm locked out of my house" :D
[06:02:48] <boytoy> hehe
[06:03:16] <boytoy> "Honey, I had to break the window"
[06:03:28] <boytoy> smash the door in
[06:06:07] <Asmooh> hi :)
[06:06:16] <Asmooh> i hate javascript, but jquery is cool
[06:06:38] <Asmooh> but jquery should be cross platform... right?
[06:08:17] <sacho> jQuery aims to reduce browser incompatibilities and is thus marketed as "cross-browser" - not cross platform.
[06:08:31] <Asmooh> ah okay :)
[06:09:12] <CasW> But most browsers have their own javascript engine and a whole lot of them are cross-platform, so you could say jQuery is 'cross-platform'
[06:10:26] <Asmooh> no because i have a small problem, but i dont know if its the code or the browser/platform
[06:10:40] <CasW> Well, what's your problem then?
[06:11:15] <Asmooh> well, i have a photo upload script, it shows howmuch % is left.. works on blackberry 10, works in my google chrome browser, but not on android
[06:11:41] <CasW> Can I see the code?
[06:11:41] <sacho> ah, "works", the highest form of clarification of an issue
[06:11:50] <Asmooh> sure
[06:11:52] <Asmooh> 1 sec
[06:13:15] <Asmooh> http://pastebin.com/YUSSv1kj
[06:13:58] <Asmooh> div processnumber shows the % bar
[06:14:16] <Asmooh> i can try to move it out of the form section?
[06:16:22] <CasW> Where's the jQuery? :-P Anyways, jQuery does help with things like XMLHttpRequests and such (I believe, don't know for sure for the specific case of xmlhttprequest)
[06:16:41] <Asmooh> i tought xml was jquery :o
[06:16:44] <Asmooh> my mistake :(
[06:17:10] <CasW> Doesn't matter :-P http://jquery.com
[06:19:38] <Asmooh> hm how can i delete the code now
[06:19:42] <Asmooh> from pastebin
[06:20:16] <CasW> Not sure you can :-P
[06:20:26] <Asmooh> sucks :P
[06:27:08] <boytoy> doug65536: not sure yet honestly i just tried to copy/paste the .done stuff and see where the road leads me :P
[06:27:18] <boytoy> * to see
[06:28:13] <boytoy> doug65536: ill let ya know what embedly support says
[06:28:22] <boytoy> i <3 embeds
[06:33:36] <doug65536> boytoy: yes it's a cool idea
[06:34:13] <doug65536> on your own site you can do cross-site ajax with your own server side code, but that service is great for people going through a CMS or blogging engine or something
[06:35:51] <boytoy> doug65536: no doubt! although im now going for embedly because cross-site ajax gave me another problem -- mobile scrolling (https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/issues/41)
[06:35:51] <b-ot> boytoy: Issue #41 by doublejosh (28mon 1w ago): iframe within scrollable content
[06:36:55] <boytoy> embeds kept hijacking my users' scroll gestures. i tried to add an invisible top layer to the embeds which would enable scrolling but the whole same site policy got in the way
[06:38:19] <doug65536> boytoy: yes I actually dislike that stuff it does to the scrollbar a lot. I wish it would just let the browser do a normal scroll bar to be honest
[06:38:37] <boytoy> yeah :/
[06:38:43] <doug65536> I'll take usable over cool looking anyday
[06:38:55] <boytoy> hehe aye aye :)
[06:39:15] <boytoy> whats cool today probably wont be cool tomorrow anyway!

[06:41:49] <platzhirsch> Do you think modals are a good way to implement a search dialog?
[06:44:59] <javalover> well css is currently dead, does anyone know how I can setup a default height of a paragraph
[06:45:20] <javalover> I want it so that even if i have 1 line of text in the paragraph it's like 400 px, but if i have more it only increases based on text going over 400px
[06:45:39] <javalover> so I can have 1 paragraph that has 1 line of text format the same as a paragraph with 3 lines of text
[06:46:37] <sacho> have you tried min-heigh?
[06:46:40] <sacho> height*
[06:47:12] <javalover> i did
[06:47:17] <javalover> i think i have to put it on a div surrounding it
[06:47:18] <javalover> for some reason
[06:48:33] <javalover> hmm nope
[06:48:35] <javalover> unless
[06:48:45] <javalover> for whatever reason it has to do with starting out with minheight & firebug ruins it
[06:49:40] <javalover> min-height is good for always having the min height it just ruins when I get a higher height is all
[06:49:54] <javalover> i need it like min-height for first line but then...can increase & not have that min-height attached...
[06:56:04] <javalover> it's probably my code
[06:56:06] <javalover> as i'm noticing
[06:59:03] <javalover> oh i get it...it's cuz i was inside a table row
[06:59:05] <javalover> i get it now ok
[06:59:07] <javalover> my fault
[07:46:18] <porton> I need to maintain a subset of all persons in my DB with ability to edit (by "Edit" button) either every person or every person currently in the subset (both variants are acceptable). Which jQuery widget?
[08:05:52] <ggdevelop> i have 2 tabs they both has submit button ans when im pressing the submit in the second tab its display the first tab, why is it?
[08:07:40] <BillCriswell> ggdevelop: The page is returning to the state you arrived at it in. Is this form using AJAX to handle the submission or just doing the default action?
[08:25:07] <okdamn> hi i have this simple event http://pastebin.com/JJHqYGbj
[08:25:17] <okdamn> this takes an ajax json object
[08:25:27] <okdamn> and put it in a wrapper div
[08:25:43] <okdamn> as you can see it puts the item after 6 seconds
[08:26:04] <okdamn> i'm wondering if this , in case of multiple items to put, it will put them like a queue
[08:26:14] <okdamn> or all togheter after 6 seconds
[08:26:28] <okdamn> how can i queue this event to put each item after 6 seconds?
[08:26:32] <okdamn> without using setTimeout
[08:26:39] <okdamn> can you help me please? :)
[08:27:15] <okdamn> anyone here?
[08:31:25] <BillCriswell> okdamn: Why don't you want to use setTimeout
[08:31:56] <okdamn> BillCriswell:  shit for mobiles
[08:32:08] <okdamn> just need closures i guess?
[08:32:39] <okdamn> i just need to be sure that calling the method it will be executed only if the previous has finished
[08:37:23] <BillCriswell> okdamn: Sorry, pretty hungover this morning.
[08:37:40] <okdamn> hey no problem :)
[08:38:38] <ggdevelop> BillCriswell: im doing the default action , i'm not using ajax
[08:38:39] <BillCriswell> So basically, you are requesting some data, but you don't want to request it until the previous request is finished?
[08:40:37] <okdamn> BillCriswell:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18300734/jquery-javascript-queue-a-method-to-be-runned-again-only-if-it-finished-befo
[08:40:44] <okdamn> this is my question
[08:41:08] <okdamn> check at the end hope it's clear :P my english sucks
[08:42:08] <ggdevelop> BillCriswell: so what can i do to for staing on the same tab?
[08:42:50] <okdamn> BillCriswell:  i would like to run those methods sequentially and not togheter just that :P
[08:42:57] <okdamn> *that method broadCast()
[08:43:11] <okdamn> actually this:
[08:43:13] <okdamn> broadCast(json1);
[08:43:13] <okdamn> broadCast(json2);
[08:43:17] <okdamn> will run at same time
[08:43:28] <okdamn> i would like second method to wait until first method is finished
[08:43:37] <okdamn> dynamically obviously
[08:43:39] <jop008> how to prevent a form from submitting?
[08:43:52] <okdamn> jop008:  preventDefault()
[08:44:00] <BillCriswell> ggdevelop: You can use AJAX to submit the form, which is pretty clean. If you don't want to do that you can pass a  a variable back from your form submission that's $activeTab or something.
[08:44:23] <okdamn> jop008:  prevent on a click or what?
[08:44:29] <okdamn> explain it better please
[08:45:25] <PhlowHome> change its action to something silly like javascript:return false; ?
[08:46:00] <jop008> on a return
[08:46:18] <jop008> it is a guest user who can't submot the form
[08:46:23] <okdamn> action="javascript:void(0)" ? dunno try
[08:46:28] <okdamn> or action="return false;"
[08:46:33] <jop008> form choosen for technical reason
[08:46:38] <jop008> thx
[08:46:44] <BillCriswell> okdamn: You could use $.then for that particular example.  $.get( '1.php' ).then( $.get('2.php') ).done(function(){ /* Done */ });
[08:47:13] <okdamn> BillCriswell:  ok but i can't know how many times the method will be called
[08:47:19] <okdamn> i mean it's dinamycally called
[08:47:34] <okdamn> each time a new item comes up from the socket it will be called broadCast()
[08:47:41] <okdamn> have you a specific example ? :P
[08:47:46] <okdamn> thx uh
[08:50:21] <okdamn> i would like sort of queue like $.queue_push(broadCast());
[08:50:30] <okdamn> but hummm damn :D
[08:51:02] <BillCriswell> okdamn: So these broadcatds are coming in randomly?
[08:51:08] <BillCriswell> broadcasts*
[08:51:32] <okdamn> BillCriswell:  they comes yep each time a new socket item is available
[08:51:38] <okdamn> so i can't know when :P
[08:51:50] <okdamn> so it's randomly at the end
[08:53:04] <okdamn> i just do if(new_socket_item){ broadCast(json_from_socket); }
[08:56:32] <okdamn> BillCriswell:  any clue dude?
[09:01:36] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking, slowly
[09:04:46] <okdamn> BillCriswell:  lol ok np :))
[09:19:16] <BillCriswell> okdamn: http://jsfiddle.net/4FmHG/1/ This is kind of like what I think you need? The top is just faking sockets sending shit in. Keep in mind I'm hungover and have never needed to do this.
[09:19:50] <BillCriswell> The setTimeout in request should be an ajax call. Just didn't know a better way to fake it for demo purposes
[09:22:42] <BillCriswell> okdamn: Can't you just have the socket send the data that you need to work with instead of the ajax calll or am I making this ajax call situation up in my head?
[09:23:09] <BillCriswell> I shouldn't be helping anyone.
[09:24:55] <BillCriswell> I'm out! later1
[09:28:28] <okdamn> ok no i can't socket pushes each time to the browser, no ajax involved ;)
[09:38:33] <xenaxon> hi
[09:38:46] <xenaxon> guys has anyone worked with typehead.js ?
[11:18:32] <ravenzz> anyone around?
[11:21:26] <pixelpimp> ravenzz: a question you should probably never ask on IRC
[11:21:34] <pixelpimp> there are 780 people here; ask your question
[11:21:43] <ravenzz> idling moslty
[11:21:58] <pixelpimp> sure.  but none of them can answer a question that hasn't been asked
[11:22:25] <ravenzz> nvm
[11:22:45] <ravenzz> see here is how event delegation is supposed to work http://jsfiddle.net/6mUAh/
[11:23:07] <ravenzz> if you click on the span, it doesn't propagate too as expected
[11:23:22] <ravenzz> do you see something wrong in this implementation https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/utils.js#L218 ?
[11:23:50] <ravenzz> seems like that a collection of event handlers is executed no matter what
[11:25:34] <ravenzz> this is the syntax for the latter element.on('click', { target1: handler1, target2, handler2 })
[11:26:52] <pixelpimp> not sure what you're trying to do; your fiddle behaves as I would expect you to want
[11:26:53] <ravenzz> here the on method in details https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/base.js#L83
[11:27:20] <ravenzz> pixelpimp yep, in fact I am trying to figure out if the flight version is "buggy"
[11:28:17] <ravenzz> I am familiar with the jQuery one and expecting the same behaviour
[11:28:53] <pixelpimp> i've never used flightjs, so i couldn't say
[11:29:04] <ravenzz> np
[11:29:38] <ravenzz> I'll make a testcase anyway
[11:34:40] <ravenzz> see http://jsfiddle.net/p98fV/
[11:34:41] <ravenzz> pixelpimp ^
[11:54:09] <JelmerD> Guys, I am having a strange issue with my ajax calls. After 2 calls (the third one) it takes a while before the Ajax request actually begins. It just waits, and after a while it thinks: hey, let's start. I am using chrome and a very basic ajax call. Did anybody every have a sort-a-like problem?
[11:55:20] <JelmerD> I am just doing a simple GET request and I am logging everything. And at this moment I am sure it has to do with the $.ajax which is simply not starting. The server logs aren't saying it has a request either and the document ajaxStart doesn't trigger either. A log just before the ajax start does trigger though. So it is nothing in front of the ajax which is blocking the request.
[12:38:49] <cygo> Hi, I was trying the jquery help link: http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/ when i try to add the "Thanks for visitng" alert it doesn't pop up but just takes me to jquery.com, how can I figure out why that's happening?
[12:53:10] <cygo> i didn't have jquery downloaded oops
[13:03:47] <lolmaus> How do i narrow an existing collection of items by matching a selector? I need something like `$myInputs.only(':checked').click(...);`
[13:04:14] <lolmaus> Oh, bad example, i actually need `$myInputs.only(':checked').each(...);`
[13:05:31] <lolmaus> Oh, i found it! Its' `.filter()`
[13:05:45] <Snerf> .is('checked')
[13:06:35] <lolmaus> Snerf, nope, i thought of it too, but it returns a boolean value and i need a collection
[13:07:08] <Snerf> ah, I see, right
[13:08:20] <sunbeam> how can i make sure that a background image always fits the full width of the divs its in?
[13:09:09] <Snerf> background-size: 100%; /
[13:09:27] <lolmaus> sunbeam, do you need a boolean value returned or you just want it never go beyond container?
[13:10:10] <lolmaus> To never go beyond container, i suggest CSS: `background-color: contain`, it will fit the image without distorting.
[13:10:33] <sunbeam> lolmaus: the image
[13:10:35] <sunbeam> needs to scale
[13:10:37] <sunbeam> the full width
[13:10:56] <lolmaus> sunbeam,  CSS: `background-color: contain;`
[13:10:59] <lolmaus> oh
[13:11:02] <lolmaus> i'm sorry
[13:11:09] <lolmaus> sunbeam, `background-size: contain`
[13:11:12] <sunbeam> ahh
[13:11:25] <sunbeam> background-attachment ?
[13:12:06] <sunbeam> this doesn't work
[13:12:57] <sunbeam> nvm

[13:31:14] <fury> i am loading jquery with the defer attribute. i have a small inline script on one single page that isn't used anywhere else, and it isn't working because it executes before jquery is loaded (so $ is not defined). is there any way to defer an inline script, or force it to wait for jquery to load, or do i just need to turn that into a script?
[13:31:23] <fury> to be deferred as well

[15:17:52] <grafi> animation goes perfectly well, might just be too much on a mobile
[15:20:08] <Tomashe> what device or u checkin git ?
[15:20:14] <Tomashe> i got iphone4
[15:20:34] <grafi> razr maxx
[15:20:35] <Tomashe> i just chnaged it all to CSS driven animation with transitions
[15:20:40] <Tomashe> so maybe this is what u see it better
[15:20:50] <Tomashe> i was tring another approach
[15:22:33] <grafi> solid advise for mobile sites is dont overdo it
[15:22:49] <grafi> not everybody is surfing with the latest iphone
[15:22:59] <grafi> or a galaxy s4
[15:24:13] <Krambiorix> hmm there is still one mistake in it : http://jsfiddle.net/G4ftY/5/  -> see 40001  -> should be on top... Anyone?
[15:25:10] <Tomashe> so what is the advice?
[15:25:24] <grafi> "dont overdo it"
[15:25:32] <Tomashe> leave it on JS ?
[15:25:40] <Tomashe> with css transitions
[15:25:43] <Tomashe> without*
[15:25:52] <grafi> css transitions should be better
[15:26:01] <Tomashe> yes this is what i saied
[15:26:28] <grafi> im just saying you shouldnt do heavy animations in general, for mobile sites
[15:27:02] <Tomashe> what i have is heavy?
[15:27:17] <grafi> if its still laggy on your iphone
[15:27:29] <Tomashe> yes im still even with css transitions :/
[15:28:01] <Krambiorix> it's like the sort function is only comparing one number with another and not with all others
[15:28:03] <rrva> Why does this line yield "Object doesn't support this property or method" in IE10?  $(".paint-type-btns .btn-black").get().map( ... );
[15:28:15] <Tomashe> IE is shit LOL
[15:28:34] <rrva> is map() the problem?
[15:29:13] <Krambiorix> queryman any idea?
[15:29:38] <rrva> sorry ie7/ie8
[15:29:42] <grafi> Krambiorix http://jsfiddle.net/G4ftY/6/
[15:30:58] <Krambiorix> grafi, that's not sorting, thus comparing all numbers....
[15:31:13] <grafi> well thats what happens in your example
[15:31:36] <Krambiorix> grafi, can i change that?
[15:31:50] <grafi> not sure, probably, dont know how though
[15:38:44] <Krambiorix> anyone else?
[15:41:50] <Krambiorix> grafi, it's not normal behaviour that it doesn't compare each number with each number, right?
[15:42:11] <grafi> i would think not
[15:49:06] <Krambiorix> Tomashe, any idea?
[15:53:48] <Krambiorix> ok anyone???

[19:34:54] <airshock> Hi all. Running into an odd problem. Using PHP to present data from a MySQL DB in an HTML table, with a link in each row to perform a specific action. This link opens a jQuery I dialog and passes via the .ajax function the ID of the row. Problem is the dialog only opens if the very first row is clicked, but does not work on any other rows.
[19:35:27] <airshock> Not sure why this is happening, especially since the required ID is correctly getting passed even when clicking on a link in a row other than the first row in the table, but the dialog still only opens on the first row.
[19:53:26] <airshock> Can anyone help me troubleshoot this for a sec? Would really appreciate any assistance provided as I am rather new to jQuery. :)
[19:55:58] <grafi> Show some code airshock
[19:58:19] <grafi> like some sample html, and the javascript you use
[20:00:04] <airshock> Here is the jQuery code that fires when the link is clicked on, HTML code will be coming in a sec: http://pastie.org/8248969
[20:01:21] <airshock> And here is the HTML/PHP, important part is down towards the bottom where HTML table is generated based on data in MySQL database and links for each row are created: http://pastie.org/8248975
[20:01:54] <grafi> you cant have multiple ids with the same value in your html ...
[20:02:12] <grafi> #showSendNotificationForm make that a class in html and js
[20:05:10] <airshock> grafi: Currently the ID of the row that gets passed via AJAX is stored in the class of #showSendNotificationForm. But if I change #showSendNotificationForm to a class how can I then pass in the ID of the specific row since an element can have only one class?
[20:05:39] <grafi> an element can only have one class?
[20:05:51] <grafi> paste the html
[20:06:34] <sammych> I have a draggable pane that takes up at least 1/3 of the screen at any given time. The draggable has a handle on the header bar. I'm wondering if there's a simple way to make it so only the handle is contrained. not the draggable element? Otherwise, I might have to do something ugly like reposition on the stop callback to bring the handle back onto the screen
[20:08:41] <airshock> Here is just the HTML (taken from the source file I pasted earlier) for the link that is supposed to open a dialog when clicked: http://pastie.org/8248984
[20:10:44] <grafi> erm
[20:10:57] <grafi> oô
[20:11:48] <airshock> grafi: As far as I know an HTML element can only have one class, otherwise how would you distinguish between them? But anyway I pasted HTML as you asked and gave a link in my last message. Perhaps I'm just doing something wrong here.
[20:12:17] <grafi> <div class="first second third"></div>
[20:12:24] <grafi> is definately valid html
[20:15:11] <grafi> ok so im too lazy to dissect your php/html so im going of your description in here
[20:15:16] <grafi> let me prepare a fiddle
[20:15:49] <airshock> grafi: OK, if you need a better description/more info let me know.
[20:17:41] <grafi> i wonder
[20:17:47] <grafi> when you create the table
[20:17:59] <grafi> do you store the id somewhere in there?
[20:18:33] <grafi> if so what are you fetching with the ajax?
[20:18:37] <grafi> more info?
[20:18:43] <airshock> Yeah, I display the ID to the end user as the first column of the table, but also store that same ID as the class of the #showSendNotificationForm element.
[20:21:09] <grafi> but you only have one #showSendThingie and multiple rows?
[20:22:05] <airshock> In the code there is only one shown because I am using a while loop in PHP to loop through data output from the MySQL database. If there is more than one row in the MySQL table then there will be more than one row in the HTML table, and each row will have a separate ID.
[20:26:14] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/LD375/
[20:30:19] <airshock> grafi: Just looked at the code you posted. What solution are you proposing, exactly?
[20:30:55] <grafi> you wanted links that open modals with specific information
[20:30:58] <grafi> that what it does
[20:31:06] <grafi> *thats
[20:31:07] <doug65536> airshock: yeah, don't use class as a dumping ground for information. use data attributes like grafi showed
[20:31:37] <grafi> you save the inside the link, or get it from the table row, then do your ajax stuff if you must
[20:31:42] <grafi> and then show the modal
[20:31:44] <doug65536> airshock: attributes that begin with data- are reserved for developer use
[20:31:50] <airshock> Never heard of "data attributes" before, are they special bits of HTML code or something?
[20:31:56] <doug65536> airshock: you can have as many as you like
[20:32:29] <doug65536> data-weight="20kg" data-shippingavailable="yes"
[20:32:30] <doug65536> etc
[20:33:14] <doug65536> then in jquery, element.data('weight') or .data('shippingavailable') etc
[20:34:07] <doug65536> in an element, like <a href="#" data-weight="20kg" data-shippingavailable="yes">Add Product</a>
[20:34:12] <doug65536> etc
[20:34:42] <airshock> That is so cool! I never even knew data attributes existed. Still a bit confused as to how to reference them in jQuery though. I see from the fiddle I can put them in links.
[20:35:00] <doug65536> airshock: grafi showed you one with data-id
[20:35:08] <doug65536> airshock: look at .data('id') call
[20:35:43] <doug65536> $('#some_id).data('weight')
[20:35:48] <doug65536> $('#some_id').data('weight')
[20:36:19] <doug65536> airshock: any element
[20:36:59] <doug65536> airshock: w3c spec reserves attributes that begin with "data-" as reserved, they will never conflict with future standard attributes
[20:37:13] <doug65536> reserved for your use
[20:39:12] <yannick__> hey guys, is there an online service for customizing jquery 2?
[20:40:09] <airshock> So trying to relate this to my specific code, if I had a <a> element with data-id="1" for example, and a class, could I use this to get the value of data-id: 	var item = $(this).data('id');
[20:41:12] <grafi> exactly as shown in the example
[20:41:13] <grafi> :)
[20:42:47] <yannick__> another question: does it make sense to cache the <body> or is it easier to use document.body?
[20:46:54] <airshock> You guys are awesome! I just implemented data attributes into my code and now each row of the table shows the dialog like it should! Thanks for your help and for teaching me something I had never even heard of before. :)
[20:47:36] <grafi> no problemo
[21:02:36] * tw2113 takes a little credit despite helping not at all
[21:08:19] <grafi> tw2113 bad tw2113
[21:08:21] <grafi> xD
[21:09:11] <tw2113> if you must smack my hand make me feel it
[21:18:24] <MarkyC> How can I achieve this: http://jsfiddle.net/5TB9M/ (this problem is better explained in code, sorry)
[21:21:27] <grafi> MarkyC what is that?? a function object? xD
[21:25:00] <MarkyC> grafi: I'm still learning JS/jQuery. How would one make an Object with a constructor and member fn's and variables?
[21:29:14] <freebirD2> I'm having some serious trouble trying to validate a simple select, and when I try to put it online in fiddle, it's not working at all, all I want is the select to be verified :http://jsfiddle.net/NV4WR/
[21:29:27] <freebirD2> please, some one have it a look
[21:32:25] <freebirD2> anyone has a clue why selects always give me a hard time when validating
[21:39:33] <Andrew_R> freebirD2: you need to tell jsfiddle to use jquery, and you need to include your plugin files for it to work
[21:40:08] <doug65536> freebirD2: you didn't enable jquery
[21:40:10] <freebirD2> Andrew_R, there are like 15 in here
[21:40:16] <freebirD2> js's
[21:40:48] <Andrew_R> yeah, and it isn't going to work unless you include them
[21:42:08] <Andrew_R> first, choose jquery under "frameworks & extensions", then go to "external resources" and add the necessary js and css urls.
[21:43:48] <doug65536> freebirD2: where is .uniform() supposed to come from?
[21:44:10] <doug65536> I added jquery validation plugin and the "extra methods" plugin and .uniform() still throws an exception
[21:45:41] <doug65536> I added uniform.js, still throws
[21:46:03] <freebirD2> doug65536, not sure man
[21:46:04] <freebirD2> http://jsfiddle.net/NV4WR/2/
[21:46:10] <freebirD2> didn't work as well
[21:46:26] <freebirD2> I'm not very good with JS, took this code from the net
[21:46:39] <doug65536> freebirD2:  do you have a link to that source?
[21:46:48] <doug65536> they must mention the dependencies somewhere
[21:47:17] <freebirD2> I've added all the js's , but I only have it in here, localhost
[21:47:24] <freebirD2> doug65536,
[21:47:53] <freebirD2> but this html, with the js you see in there, I'm trying to validate my select, all the others work ok, but the select wont validate
[21:48:03] <doug65536> ok you fixed the error
[21:48:04] <freebirD2> doug65536, why, I can't understand why
[21:48:14] <freebirD2> in fiddle, no,
[21:48:33] <doug65536> it doesn't throw exceptions anymore I mean
[21:48:43] <doug65536> so it has a chance of ever working now
[21:48:58] <freebirD2> sorry ? what should I do ?
[21:49:45] <Andrew_R> how are you defining your selectNone validation type?
[21:50:03] <freebirD2> http://jsfiddle.net/NV4WR/4/
[21:50:08] <freebirD2> Andrew_R,
[21:50:15] <freebirD2> it's in there the code
[21:51:29] <Andrew_R> did you add it to the validate rules somewhere?
[21:51:53] <freebirD2> 		tipo:{
[21:51:53] <freebirD2> 				selectNone: true
[21:51:53] <freebirD2> 			},
[21:51:59] <freebirD2> I've tryed it all
[21:52:02] <freebirD2> required:true
[21:52:05] <freebirD2> minlenght
[21:53:20] <Andrew_R> I don't think selectNone is built into validate - if you want to use that, you have to have this in your code somewhere before you use it:
[21:53:22] <Andrew_R> jQuery.validator.addMethod(   "selectNone",   function(value, element) {     if (element.value == "none")     {       return false;     }     else return true;   },   "Please select an option." );
[21:54:11] <Andrew_R> I don't know what select2 does, but it may be messing with the validation.
[21:54:27] <Andrew_R> Try removing that for a minute and see if it works with a plain select element
[21:54:47] <doug65536> oh wait...
[21:54:49] <doug65536> nothing will work
[21:54:59] <doug65536> .uniform() crashes the script
[21:55:11] <doug65536> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'uniform'
[21:55:46] <Andrew_R> it's not going to work on the fiddle, because he just entered the name of the js file, not an actual uri
[21:55:47] <doug65536> tons of 404 - not found
[21:55:52] <doug65536> you need to put full urls in there
[21:56:36] <doug65536> Andrew_R: we're speaking in stereo :)
[21:57:21] <doug65536> freebirD2: where did that huge list of external resources come from?
[21:57:31] <doug65536> did you just throw in every name you've ever heard of?
[21:58:08] <freebirD2> they are being included in my file
[21:58:24] <doug65536> freebirD2: what you want to do is find a CDN for each one (content delivery network)
[21:59:15] <freebirD2> doug65536, anyway, if you look to the code, do you something wrong ? should I remove the word uniform ?
[21:59:27] <freebirD2> because in here it works, only the select that doesnt
[21:59:55] <doug65536> freebirD2: what are you trying to accomplish? just experimenting or doing some real task?
[22:00:16] <freebirD2> doug65536, real task, I just want to be able to validate a select input
[22:00:23] <freebirD2> that's all, looll
[22:00:56] <freebirD2> we save hours using jquery, but when we have to use a submit, it takes like 20 hours to get it done
[22:01:03] <freebirD2> so complicated man
[22:01:33] <doug65536> seriously? you need better people
[22:01:53] <doug65536> 2 forms a week?
[22:02:16] <doug65536> you understand how external resources work right?
[22:02:33] <Andrew_R> freebirD2: Have you tried removing the select2() call from your local copy and did it have any effect?
[22:04:19] <freebirD2> Andrew_R, 1 min
[22:04:46] <freebirD2> Andrew_R, did it, but still the same
[22:05:44] <Andrew_R> I don't know what select2() does, but I suspected an incompatibility with validate... I guess not.
[22:05:57] <Andrew_R> Are you getting any errors in the console?
[22:06:16] <freebirD2> doug65536, added the line before the call, didn't work: <script type="text/javascript">
[22:06:17] <freebirD2>      jQuery.validator.addMethod(   "tipo",   function(value, element) {     if (element.value == "none")     {       return false;     }     else return true;   },   "Please select an option." );</script>
[22:06:21] <Andrew_R> and if you are still using "selectNone" can you confirm you defined that rule somewhere
[22:06:49] <freebirD2> Andrew_R,
[22:06:50] <freebirD2> no
[22:07:05] <freebirD2> all I've is the js in the fiddle
[22:07:16] <doug65536> I got it almost working http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/NV4WR/9/
[22:07:32] <doug65536> almost not crashing horribly immediately I mean
[22:07:51] <mfoxdogg|work> afternoon all
[22:08:07] <freebirD2> many people in the internet say we can get with required:true
[22:08:16] <freebirD2> Andrew_R,
[22:09:12] <doug65536> much better now http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/NV4WR/10/
[22:11:56] <Andrew_R> looks like they are right: http://jsfiddle.net/NV4WR/11/
[22:12:18] <doug65536> selectNone validation method is not defined
[22:13:14] <Andrew_R> doug65536: that's what I've been saying. validate doesn't include a "selectNone" validation method, so if you want it, you have to define it first.
[22:13:48] <freebirD2> Andrew_R, how do I do that ?
[22:14:02] <freebirD2> how do I do it in the easyest way ?
[22:14:47] <Andrew_R> I pasted the code a while back
[22:16:01] <Andrew_R> http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/jquery/form_validation/index.html under "Writing your own validation method"
[22:22:13] <freebirD2> got the code
[22:22:17] <freebirD2> still doesn't work; http://jsfiddle.net/NV4WR/12/
[22:22:23] <freebirD2> Andrew_R, doug65536
[22:22:41] <freebirD2> in JS area, in the top
[22:23:54] <doug65536> that version of jquery is not compatible with one of those plugins
[22:24:42] <freebirD2> doug65536, get itttt
[22:24:42] <freebirD2> http://jsfiddle.net/NV4WR/14/
[22:24:49] <freebirD2> but the select wont validate
[22:24:50] <freebirD2> why ??
[22:24:52] <freebirD2> doug65536, Andrew_R
[22:26:31] <doug65536> this validates: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/NV4WR/18/
[22:26:38] <doug65536> am I missing something?
[22:27:48] <doug65536> freebirD2: combine that with your selectnone method and it should work
[22:28:40] <doug65536> or just turn that off since if no selection is valid why bother validating? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/NV4WR/19/
[22:29:55] <doug65536> freebirD2: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/NV4WR/19/ ?
[22:30:58] <doug65536> freebirD2: why "validate" the select if no selection is valid. I just commented that one out
[22:31:16] <freebirD2> doug65536, didn't work yours
[22:31:26] <doug65536> freebirD2: what didn't work
[22:31:34] <freebirD2> the first one did it
[22:31:43] <freebirD2> but not working in here
[22:31:46] <freebirD2> weird
[22:31:50] <doug65536> freebirD2: what didn't work
[22:32:02] <freebirD2> the script in here
[22:32:42] <doug65536> what script in where
[22:33:03] <doug65536> you ran my fiddle and pressed submit right?
[22:34:07] <freebirD2> doug65536, yeah, it worked, I saw it
[22:34:25] <freebirD2> but when I copy that working code, and paste into my local code, I get the same problem
[22:34:36] <doug65536> what problem
[22:35:06] <doug65536> I don't remember you saying what the original problem was
[22:35:28] <doug65536> don't say "doesn't work"
[22:35:30] <chovy> how can i compare e.target to see if it matches a selector?
[22:35:47] <chovy> $('table').on('click', function(e){
[22:35:57] <freebirD2> the problem is that the select is not being validated man
[22:36:00] <chovy>  //need to know if it was a.trash that was clicked or not
[22:36:10] <doug65536> freebirD2: define "validated"
[22:36:17] <freebirD2> checked if filled
[22:36:34] <freebirD2> checked if actual input has more than 1 char, get it ?
[22:36:46] <doug65536> freebirD2: in your fiddle, the user can't select anything, there are no options
[22:37:01] <freebirD2> doug65536, any way should be validated man,
[22:37:05] <Mattias> chovy, on click event, and if there are several a.trash, add a data-id attribute to it and check that
[22:37:13] <freebirD2> like it's happening in the fiddle you sent me
[22:37:30] <chovy> i think i can check with is()
[22:37:42] <chovy> if ( $(e.target).is('tr a.trash')
[22:37:57] <chovy> not sure
[22:38:53] <Mattias> choby $('table').on('click', 'a.trash', function(e) {
[22:38:56] <Mattias> chovy ^^
[22:40:20] <doug65536> chovy: the .is works if you need to handle different things. Mattias suggestion works if you want to make sure it is just handling events from that one thing
[22:40:43] <Mattias> chovy, for different things, I'd highly recommend using a data attribute
[22:40:54] <Mattias> then just check the element's data attr for the value
[22:44:54] <boytoy> At this text truncator -- http://jsbin.com/okahum/58/edit -- how does one not truncate images? Would it be best to move images out of .articles altogether?
[22:46:40] <doug65536> boytoy: what truncation?
[22:47:57] <boytoy> doug65536: basically each .articles p gets truncated. i have 3 .articles there, the top one is correct but the presence of an image in the bottom two makes things difficult.
[22:48:19] <doug65536> boytoy: ah sorry, I didn't run it
[22:49:20] <boytoy> in that case let me rephrase my answer: it uses jquery trunk8
[22:51:00] <doug65536> boytoy: yes I see that
[22:52:08] <doug65536> boytoy: img doesn't even occur in the plugin source code
[22:53:43] <boytoy> good point
[22:54:43] <mobasher> Hi i load some part of page with ajax and i want somw jquery code to be executed for that elements. forexample to change their class , ... after loading. but when the content is loaded with ajax it doesn't work what can i do?
[22:55:11] <doug65536> boytoy: a quick skim of the source shows that it strips all html then tries to find the length of text that will be that many lines with a binary search algorithm, homing in on what length of text will be that many lines
[22:56:03] <doug65536> boytoy: it might be feasible to make it protect images
[22:56:23] <doug65536> boytoy: if you modify it
[22:59:24] <boytoy> doug65536: cool
[22:59:58] <boytoy> doug65536: thats a lotta knowledge extracted from a quick skim =)
[23:00:10] <boytoy> i better open up an issue on its gh page
[23:45:04] <Al2> hi everyone
[23:45:28] <Al2> got this fiddle set up and what i'd liek to do is to add a field when user clicks on a button: http://jsfiddle.net/albertpak/hxP5U/
[23:45:31] <Al2> but right now it's not working
[23:45:44] <Al2> and in my console i don't see any errors
[23:51:28] <Cork> Al2: http://jsfiddle.net/hxP5U/2/
[23:52:33] <Al2> @Cork - THANK YOU :)
[23:52:54] <Cork> Al2: personally i would prob go with http://jsfiddle.net/hxP5U/3/ instead
[23:53:19] <Cork> Al2: also id="family_admin" is invalid
[23:53:34] <Al2> oh ic
[23:53:39] <Cork> you would have multiple elements with the same id, and that's not allowed in html
[23:53:42] <Cork> (or dom)
[23:53:46] <Al2> thank you very much
[23:53:51] <Cork> np
[23:53:59] <Al2> so would it make sense to have "family_admin[]"
[23:54:10] <Cork> Al2: add the count to the id
[23:54:34] <Cork> that way each id will be uniq
[23:54:38] <Al2> (facepalm) shud've thought of that
[23:54:39] <Al2> :)
[23:54:41] <Al2> thank you
[23:54:44] <Cork> np
[23:54:51] <Al2> (late night code) fun as always
