[00:00:02] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't you use a class that identifies what the element is?
[00:00:20] <robertmaxrees> do you mean "even if it is not a class for the UI framework"?
[00:01:46] <Guddddu> Sorry I got disconnected. Internet issues.
[00:02:02] <robertmaxrees> did you see my response?
[00:02:23] <Guddddu> robertmaxrees, Kindly repeat. I missed it.
[00:02:30] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't you use a class that identifies what the element is?
[00:02:36] <robertmaxrees> do you mean "even if it is not a class for the UI framework"?
[00:02:43] <Guddddu> robertmaxrees, Yes. Even if it is not a class for UI Framework i meant (just for the sake of easy selection)
[00:03:00] <robertmaxrees> you can *and should*
[00:03:11] <robertmaxrees> semantic, descriptive classnames in cases like this are a good idea.
[00:04:02] <Guddddu> robertmaxrees, One more question...In my code the "this" would resolve to the button which was clicked (of all the buttons) right?
[00:04:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[00:04:22] <Guddddu> :-)
[00:04:28] <robertmaxrees> couple notes btw
[00:04:30] <Guddddu> jquery is so much fin
[00:04:32] <Guddddu> Fun
[00:04:59] <robertmaxrees> value = $(this).parent().prev().html(); - 2 things here: 1. make sure you do var value =
[00:05:49] <robertmaxrees> and 2 - your markup structure is a little odd.  wrap a common containing element around each row and give it a classname, then use $(this).closest('.your-new-classname').html()
[00:05:53] <Guddddu> Done
[00:06:21] <Guddddu> robertmaxrees, Working on 2 now.
[00:09:40] <robertmaxrees> oh and nobody writing js these days newlines an opening curly like that - do $(document).ready(function() { ;)
[00:10:53] <robertmaxrees> (exclude the ;) - i'm just being cheeky)
[00:11:55] <Guddddu> :-)
[00:16:04] <Guddddu> robertmaxrees, .closest() does not travel upto the document root?
[00:16:28] <robertmaxrees> it starts at the current element, then check every ancestor element until the selector matches.
[00:16:50] <robertmaxrees> if you're having trouble trying to get it to work, make a jsfiddle
[00:30:08] <Guddddu> robertmaxrees, Please look at https://jsfiddle.net/zb3ydfuh/
[00:32:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jd6bnLcs/2/
[00:32:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[00:32:36] <robertmaxrees> sorry - should've asked for html much sooner.
[00:32:46] <robertmaxrees> gotta go up and then down.
[00:33:48] <robertmaxrees> the idea for a change like this is to move to selecting semantic classnames instead of random UI classnames.
[00:34:20] <robertmaxrees> and also - relying on the inherent relationships in document structure is a great way to give yourself headaches when you wanna change things later.
[00:39:47] <Guddddu> Thanks robertmaxrees Learnt a lot today
[00:40:00] <Guddddu> Incorporated this in my code and it works like a charm.
[00:40:21] <robertmaxrees> :) some time you'll learn about delegated handlers and lose your mind ;)
[01:12:29] <Guddddu> Is there a way to add a newline to a jquery string?
[01:13:10] <robertmaxrees> clarify?
[01:13:25] <robertmaxrees> there's no jsut thing as a "jquery string" so your question is a little confusing :)
[01:13:52] <robertmaxrees> *no such thing, rather
[01:13:58] <Guddddu> Simple appending '\n' does not work for copied text to clipboard as in https://jsfiddle.net/3L10zxkr/
[01:14:34] <robertmaxrees> well, for starters, newlines differ between OSes :)
[01:15:11] <robertmaxrees> also I see no "\n" in that fiddle...
[01:15:14] <Guddddu> robertmaxrees, True. Is there a way to have CRLF in that case?
[01:15:41] <Guddddu> robertmaxrees, In line 4 of the JS i am trying to do something with \n
[01:15:51] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[01:15:59] <robertmaxrees> there you're just inserting that as a string...
[01:16:08] <robertmaxrees> can you provide more context about what you're building?
[01:17:12] <Guddddu> robertmaxrees, So I have a table which has 2 json string. Request and Response. I want to copy to clipboard in the following format
[01:17:13] <Guddddu> REQUEST:
[01:17:14] <Guddddu> 	<Request Text>
[01:17:14] <Guddddu> 	
[01:17:14] <Guddddu> RESPONSE:
[01:17:14] <Guddddu> 	<Response Text>	
[01:17:19] <robertmaxrees> :|
[01:17:31] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle, I mean.
[01:18:37] <Guddddu> https://jsfiddle.net/3L10zxkr/1/
[01:18:41] <robertmaxrees> also: in that case you want var $temp = $("<textarea>");
[01:18:42] <Cork> Guddddu: your using an input field, it can't hold multiple lines
[01:18:50] <robertmaxrees> ^^ bingo
[01:18:58] <Guddddu> Ooops
[01:19:01] <Guddddu> :-)
[01:19:43] <Guddddu> With textarea it works fine :-)
[01:19:50] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[01:19:54] <Guddddu> LOL
[01:30:12] <Guddddu> Thanks robertmaxrees and Cork for your help today.
[01:49:35] <robertmaxrees> Hell yeah, my dude :)  What we're here for.
[09:01:26] <Phruis`> im trying to get this thing to float out inline to the left
[09:01:27] <Phruis`> https://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/9zgxety4/3/
[09:01:31] <Phruis`> any help is appreciate
[09:16:16] <Cork> Phruis`: make the search-bar position: absolute and #search position: relative
[09:16:40] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/paum1g8w/
[09:18:09] <Phruis`> Cork, nice you the man cork...now I just need to make it stay on the same line
[09:18:23] <Cork> uh...
[09:18:30] <Cork> stay on the same line?
[09:18:49] <Cork> if that was all you wanted then absolute isn't what you want...
[09:19:09] <Phruis`> kinda got it working
[09:19:10] <Phruis`> https://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/9zgxety4/10/
[09:19:18] <Phruis`> but it is way over on the left side of the screen
[09:19:20] <Cork> kinda asked the wrong question..
[09:19:28] <Phruis`> oh sorry
[09:19:51] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/paum1g8w/1/
[09:20:08] <Cork> and i typoed...
[09:20:15] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/paum1g8w/2/
[09:20:35] <Cork> Phruis`: div has block as the default display type
[09:21:02] <Cork> and block will always start on the next line (except for flexbox and grid situations)
[09:21:36] <Phruis`> i see
[09:22:16] <Phruis`> gotta keep tweaking this thanks for your input
[09:22:40] <Cork> Phruis`: i would suggest looking at css @key-frame
[09:22:47] <Cork> or even just transition
[09:22:57] <Cork> it will animate a lot smoother then .animate
[09:23:03] <Phruis`> i see
[09:23:23] <Phruis`> i have a form I really just want to keep a search icon on the right and have the <form> pop out on the left inline
[09:23:45] <Cork> also are you sure you want float?
[09:23:55] <Cork> as it is still affecting content in the page
[09:24:06] <Phruis`> i am probably doing that wrong
[09:24:10] <Cork> i suspect what you're looking for is position: absolute or position: fixed;
[09:24:13] <Phruis`> css is not my strong area
[09:24:37] <Cork> float is mainly for floating media inside text
[09:25:11] <Phruis`> i see
[09:25:25] <Phruis`> yeah on the fiddle it works okay, but on my page it messes up my icon pretty bad
[10:33:16] <phatcat> this generally does the job (scrolls to previous position on page reload): https://pastebin.com/Zm4GY4wF
[10:33:24] <phatcat> but sometimes there's a weird offset, up or down
[10:33:28] <phatcat> am I doing something wrong?
