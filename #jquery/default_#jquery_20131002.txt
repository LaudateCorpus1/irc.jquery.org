[00:03:50] <glosoli> hey, any ideas why wouldn't my file be sent when I add it via file upload ? All it submits and reports for the change is file name without actual content
[00:03:50] <glosoli>  ?
[00:26:25] <brianus> http://www.ibood.com/nl/nl/
[00:37:14] <DRSK> Anyone running Chrome 29?
[00:37:21] <DRSK> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Bcyfd <-- anyone able to explain this?
[00:40:03] <diverdude> Hi, Is it possible to create a directory/file structure on the client using html5?
[00:51:03] <diverdude> if i do $.each(function(){$.ajax({...})}); the ajax request will basically be done in an unordered and independent manner right?
[01:07:03] <jphase> diverdude: yes
[01:07:08] <jphase> sort of
[01:07:25] <jphase> like they won't wait for each other if that's what you mean, they will still technically be in order
[01:08:33] <diverdude> yes
[01:08:36] <diverdude> understood
[01:08:39] <diverdude> great
[01:09:59] <jphase> diverdude: you'd be looking to use deferred pipe if you wanted to have them wait for each other
[01:11:44] <diverdude> jphase, yeah ok...but its not necessary for them to wait actually :)
[01:11:53] <diverdude> i just wanted to be sure howit worked
[01:12:01] <jphase> k
[01:12:10] <DRSK> So anyone able to take a look at http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Bcyfd and tell me wtf is going on?
[01:13:19] <jphase> DRSK: what's the issue?
[01:13:47] <DRSK> jphase » The issue is that I'm getting "transition" in Chrome, and trying to use that fails, however using -webkit-transition does not fail.
[01:14:08] <DRSK> Why on earth am I not getting WebkitTransition instead of transition in Chrome?
[01:15:08] <DRSK> What am I missing here? Either Modernizr is broken or Chrome might be?
[01:16:04] <jphase> well I wee WebkitTransition
[01:16:08] <jphase> wee=see lol
[01:16:15] <jphase> er...
[01:16:23] <jphase> nvm, that's transform
[01:16:23] <DRSK> What version of Chrome?
[01:16:26] <DRSK> oh right.
[01:16:34] <jphase> hmm, yeah that's odd
[01:16:38] <DRSK> Indeed it is.
[01:16:45] <DRSK> I'm stoked
[01:16:49] <jphase> oh well, I think that's just cause chrome supports it now
[01:16:54] <jphase> natively right?
[01:16:56] <DRSK> Oh really?
[01:16:58] <jphase> v29
[01:17:03] <DRSK> I'm on 30 now, same thing.
[01:17:11] <jphase> yeah I believe so
[01:17:16] <DRSK> Point being, wait. Let me update that codepen
[01:17:27] <jphase> like when you inspect elements, you can uncheck the webkit one and it'll be fine
[01:17:53] <jphase> (if you have multiple declarations that is)
[01:33:26] <M3kH> Good morning!
[01:41:13] <jphase> morning
[01:41:28] <ingof> hi :)
[01:49:11] <DRSK> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Bcyfd <-- seriously?
[01:51:47] <glosoli> how does one disable features in jquery-file-upload like progress ?
[01:54:51] <nisseni> is there a way to post to the session directly with jquery, without going thru a method?
[02:01:54] <Cork> nisseni: "to the session"?
[02:18:14] <DRSK> Cork » any chance you could help me understand what's going on here? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/iukHJ
[02:18:53] <Cork> DRSK: nope, that site is broken so it doens't load without localstorage enabled
[02:19:05] <DRSK> Any alternative I can use ?
[02:19:11] <DRSK> jsfiddle crashed using Modernizr
[02:19:24] <glosoli> Anyone using jQuery File Uploader has any ideas if there is some way to disable Progress ? so it won't crash on IE8?
[02:21:43] <fgh> DRSK, Modernizr.prefixed( 'transition' ) returns transition
[02:22:20] <DRSK> fgh » point is, if you try clicking the box in safari or firefox, it should 'ease' to the right - yes?
[02:22:21] <fgh> i'm guessing it should return webkitTransition
[02:22:27] <fgh> that's why it doesnt work
[02:22:30] <fgh> see http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xtAmd
[02:22:38] <fgh> yes it should
[02:22:56] <DRSK> Yes, now it works for chrome with your "fix" right there
[02:23:14] <fgh> its not a fix
[02:23:17] <DRSK> but it will not for anything "not" -webkit-
[02:23:19] <fgh> it's to show you what i mean
[02:23:39] <DRSK> I'm well aware of this, I just don't know why Chrome gives "transition" instead of "webkitTransition" OR "WebkitTransition"
[02:23:47] <fgh> that's what I am saying
[02:23:58] <DRSK> Sorry hehe.
[02:24:09] <DRSK> I'm stoked, been at this for quite some time now and I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
[02:24:09] <fgh> seems like a modernizr bug?
[02:24:17] <DRSK> Yes and no
[02:24:25] <fgh> no?
[02:24:26] <DRSK> It actually looks like a Chrome one
[02:24:55] <DRSK> heck, I don't know. But I took the "function" Modernizr uses, using style or whatnot it does. Same result, Chrome reports wrong
[02:25:14] <DRSK> and doesn't work, it's like Chrome thinks it can, but actually can't, so it won't? Pf.
[02:26:15] <DRSK> fgh » do you know any other way of handling these things? If modernizr can't, what can.. :/
[02:26:23] <fgh> why would it be chrome, when modernizr is giving transition instead of webkitTransition?
[02:26:35] <DRSK> Well, Modernizr "asks" Chrome
[02:26:40] <DRSK> creating a dummy element and using style
[02:26:50] <fgh> well, there's http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
[02:27:03] <DRSK> Yeah, no
[02:27:04] <DRSK> ;p
[02:27:34] <DRSK> It's outdated and has a few bugs, been using it extensively past few days and I just abandoned it for Modernizr
[02:27:39] <DRSK> now it seems I can't use either. awesome.
[02:27:47] <fgh> well seems like its correct
[02:27:58] <fgh> modernizr is returning transition right
[02:28:21] <fgh> 'transition'       : 'transitionend'       // IE10, Opera, Chrome, FF 15+, Saf 7+
[02:40:02] <radditz> hello
[02:40:09] <radditz> what can cause the scroll event on window to not fire?
[02:45:45] <fgh> DRSK, seems like chrome is returning values correctly. document.createElement('div').style.webkitTransform returns a empty string
[02:46:14] <DRSK> Yeah ended up using transform, since it appears transition is transition in Chrome, not WebkitTransition :p
[02:46:25] <fgh> although, document.createElement('div').style.transform
[02:46:28] <fgh> is undefined in chrome
[02:47:05] <DRSK> document.createElement('div').style.WebkitTransform <- try that though, I believe it needs to be a uppercase W
[02:47:16] <fgh> both works
[02:47:22] <DRSK> had no idea, cool :)
[02:47:25] <fgh> document.createElement('div').style.WebkitTransition returns empty string too o.o
[02:47:56] <DRSK> transition in chrome is transition, transform in chrome is WebkitTransform or so doug tought me after slapping me a couple of times
[02:48:15] <DRSK> taught even? hm
[02:49:05] <fgh> although WebkitTransition property exists in chrome too
[02:49:38] <fgh> but like what you said, using transform will solve the problem
[02:56:57] <djQuery> thought they removed all the webkit prefixes
[03:00:41] <fgh> djQuery, not form .transform i guess
[03:00:44] <fgh> for*
[03:19:16] <glosoli> anyone could suggest some good file uploader plugin?
[03:45:40] <nights> hi
[03:45:48] <nights> stuck on something annoying
[03:45:57] <nights> just trying to send a string including a & etc to server
[03:46:01] <nights> through a ajax call
[03:46:09] <nights> unfortunately cant seem to figure out how
[03:46:13] <nights> used all type of stuff
[03:46:19] <nights> encodeURIComponent etc
[03:46:28] <nights> dont understand how to get it back
[03:46:58] <nights> urldecode in php doesnt work
[03:47:11] <nights> if i do that i get=> &Amp
[03:47:14] <nights> ;
[03:47:20] <doug65536> nights: don't do anything
[03:47:40] <doug65536> nights: jquery will encode for you, php will decode for you
[03:47:56] <nights> ok
[03:47:58] <nights> finally this is solved
[03:48:03] <nights> htmlspecialchars_decode
[03:48:08] <nights> this is what should be used
[03:48:14] <doug65536> nights: no, you are sending html
[03:48:21] <doug65536> nights: if you want to send text, send text
[03:48:23] <nights> yes
[03:48:40] <nights> if i send html like that i get cut off strings
[03:49:02] <nights> anyway
[03:49:03] <nights> encodeURIComponent( category.html() )
[03:49:04] <nights> and
[03:49:09] <nights> htmlspecialchars_decode ( $_POST['category_title'] );
[03:49:12] <nights> seem to worjk
[03:49:19] <doug65536> nights: you're doing it wrong
[03:49:24] <doug65536> nights: use category.text()
[03:49:25] <nights> really
[03:49:28] <doug65536> and no encode/decode
[03:49:29] <nights> hm
[03:49:32] <nights> let me try that then
[03:50:05] <nights> ok
[03:50:07] <nights> so that didnt work
[03:50:09] <nights> ...
[03:50:21] <nights> getting a bit cynical
[03:50:37] <nights> have you even tried it?
[03:50:50] <doug65536> nights: seriously? that is absolutely basic stuff
[03:50:56] <nights> yeah
[03:51:01] <nights> but it doesnt work
[03:51:02] <nights> i mean
[03:51:20] <nights> i can see what get sent
[03:51:26] <nights> and the & sign is not there
[03:51:31] <nights> because its not URL safe
[03:51:37] <nights> how could it work
[03:51:41] <doug65536> nights: $.ajax does that for you
[03:51:47] <doug65536> $.get/post/etc
[03:51:48] <nights> no it certainly did not
[03:52:03] <nights> data: 'category_id=' + category_id + '&category_title=' + category.text(),
[03:52:09] <nights> this is what i used for data
[03:52:19] <doug65536> nights: you're doing it wrong
[03:52:34] <nights> so what is the right way?
[03:52:53] <nights> anyway
[03:52:59] <doug65536> data: { category_id: category_id, category_title: category.text() }
[03:53:09] <nights> hm
[03:53:11] <nights> let me try that
[03:53:56] <doug65536> then in php, don't do anything special, the text will be there as $_REQUEST['category_id'] and $_REQUEST['category']    no need to do anything special
[03:55:16] <nights> doug65536: ok
[03:55:20] <nights> i did exactly what you said
[03:55:23] <nights> and here is the result
[03:55:33] <nights> data: { category_id: category_id, category_title: category.html(), isAjaxRequest: 1 },
[03:55:47] <doug65536> why are you using .html()
[03:56:00] <nights> oh text
[03:56:03] <nights> all right one sec
[03:56:04] <doug65536> you said do A, I did B, and it doesn't work
[03:56:07] <nights> sorry
[03:56:16] <doug65536> :)
[03:56:19] <nights> ok yes
[03:56:21] <nights> you are right
[03:56:21] <nights> it works
[03:56:23] <nights> finally
[03:56:32] <nights> so i guess i WAS doing it the wrong way
[03:56:41] <nights> god my code is full of this url building
[03:56:43] <doug65536> this way it will always work, no matter how weird the text is
[03:56:49] <nights> ok
[03:56:54] <nights> yeah
[03:56:58] <nights> i agree its much better
[03:57:02] <eeezkil> just used the datepicker from jqueryui and everything is ok.. but I want it to remember the date that was picked but it keeps going back to the default date.. I've tried using delegate and live.. maybe I'm missing something
[03:57:05] <nights> i used JSON mostly until now
[03:57:13] <nights> probably thats almost the same
[03:57:47] <nights> need to convert some of this now
[03:57:50] <nights> thanks a lot
[03:57:52] <doug65536> np
[03:57:53] <nights> this was very helpful
[03:58:42] <nights> does this work for json?
[03:58:50] <nights> so
[03:58:52] <nights> data: 'json_item=' + JSON.stringify(json_item),
[03:58:54] <nights> =>
[03:59:01] <nights> data: {json_item: JSON.stringify(json_item) },
[03:59:23] <doug65536> nights: yes that 2nd way will work. 'json_item=' + JSON.stringify(json_item) is unreliable though
[03:59:47] <nights> yeah
[03:59:50] <nights> hmm
[04:00:39] <nights> doesnt work :(
[04:00:46] <nights> hmm
[04:00:47] <nights> ah
[04:01:14] <nights> ok perfect
[04:01:21] <nights> well this was a life saver
[04:01:29] <nights> dont know why i havnt run into this before
[04:01:32] <nights> mostly sending numbers
[04:01:55] <doug65536> nights: the unreliable way will malfunction if there are any + or & in the text. just always use the reliable way and you are good
[04:02:10] <nights> yeah
[04:02:11] <nights> man
[04:02:17] <nights> what a pain ive had until now
[04:02:19] <doug65536> nights: % will cause problems with unreliable way too
[04:02:20] <nights> did stuff like replace(/[&\/\\#,+<>$~%.'":*{}]/g, '');
[04:02:25] <doug65536> :O
[04:02:48] <nights> very happy this is past now
[04:10:43] <Jac0bz1> Hi! Could some please help me for a second? I'm trying to make a responsive menu, and everything works just fine, but if I start out on a normal size screen, and then resize down to "mobile" size, the script still uses mouseenter/mouseleave instead of click. But if I reload the page in "mobile" size, It works..... any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/vq2Q9/
[04:16:03] <lannes> Can anyone clue me into what I'm doing wrong to mess up my timing on the first iteration? Site is here: http://bit.ly/16Y2DCk and pastebin of jquery is here: http://pastebin.com/udkaJfuV
[04:17:53] <lannes> Just a super-simple DIY slideshow. Nothing fancy.
[04:25:37] <doug65536> lannes: you have 'active' on 2 of the 'a's
[04:25:40] <jop008> in my callback I do a window.location = to move to another location. The problem is my save action is not fired
[04:26:10] <Cork> jop008: why would your safe action be triggered if you load a new url?
[04:26:16] <Cork> *save
[04:27:17] <lannes> good catch, doug65536. It still wants to iterate through all the slides before it starts binding the "active" state of the "control" thumbnails" to the active slide, though.
[04:28:47] <doug65536> lannes: yeah, I figured that wasn't the main problem
[04:30:39] <lannes> I've tried firing that "bindThumbsToSlides" function before, during, and after the shifting of the slides; I get some variant of the same behavior.
[04:32:19] <doug65536> lannes: wouldn't it be more reliable and intuitive if it immedialy switched the active class. i.e. don't wait until the fade is done
[04:33:24] <doug65536> lannes: also, bindThumbsToSlides should at least be a loop. copy paste is evil
[04:33:27] <lannes> Yeah, that's kinda what I thought. That was the original intention.
[04:33:33] <lannes> I know, lol.
[04:33:59] <lannes> Just want to get it working, then can tidy up.
[04:34:14] <doug65536> lannes: well, doing it with copy paste just asks for bugs
[04:34:59] <doug65536> lannes: what is the problem anyway?
[04:35:51] <lannes> The thing works, except that it shifts the active slide to the fourth of four right away, where it's initially set to the first. This causes a behavior where the bottom controls have to shift around until it hits the "active" slide, after which it behaves as expected.
[04:38:44] <doug65536> lannes: current.stop().removeClass('active').fadeOut(1000);   next.stop().addClass('active').fadeIn(1000);
[04:39:26] <lannes> You caught it as I was moving stuff around. It's the other way around; next.stop first, current.stop second.
[04:39:52] <doug65536> lannes: the order is irrelevant though. the page is froze while it runs that code
[04:40:58] <doug65536> lannes: I would also move the setTimeout out of that fadeOut and make it setTimeout(fade, 3000), then just immediately call bindThumbsToSlides
[04:41:31] <doug65536> lannes: I find it annoying that it doesn't change active until the fade is done - it doesn't make a lot of sense
[04:43:43] <doug65536> lannes: the bindThumbsToSlide just remove active from all of them on one line, and use the currentIndex to add active to the appropriate one
[04:44:49] <pekkel> hey guys, can someone tell me why my change event just gets triggered once: http://jsfiddle.net/Zqnd3/
[04:45:27] <doug65536> pekkel: because it won't fire until you exit the field. use on('input'... if you want every keystroke
[04:46:10] <pekkel> doug65536: i know, but it should trigger if i click out of the field
[04:46:22] <doug65536> pekkel: it does
[04:46:58] <pekkel> hmm not for me
[04:46:59] <doug65536> pekkel: it's a 'change' event right? you probably want a 'blur' event if you want every time they leave the field
[04:47:12] <doug65536> pekkel: you were expecting 'change' events when it didn't change?
[04:47:29] <pekkel> no i change the content
[04:47:44] <doug65536> pekkel: it works for me. are you using chrome?
[04:47:56] <Cork> the browser doesn't matter
[04:48:04] <doug65536> pekkel: chrome suppresses repetition of the same console and it shows a number beside it
[04:48:09] <pekkel> firefox
[04:48:09] <doug65536> console output*
[04:48:37] <grafi> firefox/firebug does that too doug65536
[04:48:43] <grafi> and its annoying :P
[04:48:44] <pekkel> haha omg, didn't know that
[04:49:04] <pekkel> thx alot guys
[04:49:28] <seutje> using dir can avoid that, or log it with a string counter or something
[04:50:13] <grafi> too much work
[04:50:18] <grafi> id rather find it annoying :P
[04:50:25] <doug65536> I like it
[04:50:29] <seutje> same
[04:50:51] <grafi> sure doug65536 its not baaaaad bad
[04:51:03] <grafi> but noticing the little number changing ...
[04:51:05] <grafi> is hard
[04:51:06] <grafi> ^^
[04:51:14] <doug65536> grafi: if you ever spam out events like a mousemove, it's great
[04:51:21] <grafi> totally
[04:51:22] <grafi> :P
[04:51:23] <seutje> it only gets annoying when logging a reference to an object that changed in between 2 logs, but then log is gonna be annoying either way
[04:52:09] <grafi> annoying is annoying is anooying

[04:57:41] <wild_oscar> hi. could you help me with a selector? I want to find "all inputs - text, select boxes, radio - on the same line as the button I am pressing. here's a jsfiddle with one row as example
[04:57:42] <wild_oscar> in http://jsfiddle.net/5EUst/
[04:58:01] <wild_oscar> (basically this will be a table and with one save button per row)
[04:58:06] <Grundell> Hello everyone, i want to build something like the banner on fallowing site http://www.accenture.com/se-en/Pages/index.aspx this is a flash but im planing to build it in jQuery, is anyone able to guide me how i would be able to do that?
[04:58:09] <Cork> seutje: heh, funny image!
[04:58:20] <seutje> b-anananas ©Gwenn Stefani
[04:58:44] <doug65536> wild_oscar: $(this).closest('tr').find(':input') is probably what you want
[04:58:46] <seutje> that's where she got it, I bet
[04:59:16] <wild_oscar> doug65536: ah, find, of course :)
[04:59:44] <doug65536> wild_oscar: you'll get the button, so expect that
[04:59:53] <seutje> Grundell: that masking might be tricky, but the rest is just like a regular slideshow with a fancy transition, I'd prolly try to put half in CSS
[05:00:11] <doug65536> wild_oscar: adding .not('[type=button]') will filter it out
[05:00:14] <wild_oscar> doug65536: yup, just realising that
[05:00:44] <doug65536> wild_oscar: adding .not('button') will filter it out
[05:01:00] <doug65536> wild_oscar: (I didn't bother to look at what kind of button you are using :)
[05:01:51] <doug65536> wild_oscar: why is it a submit? shouldn't it be type="button" if you are handling it on client? or are you going out of your way to handle js being disabled
[05:02:35] <doug65536> wild_oscar: I guess making it submit will give you <enter> press saves behavior
[05:02:48] <seutje> yeah, there's no <form> wrapper, so a submit won't rly do much
[05:02:50] <Grundell> seutje: okay, how would i do the masking...
[05:02:50] <doug65536> wild_oscar: I don't see a form tag
[05:03:15] <wild_oscar> doug65536: actually I hadn't gotten to that part, but type="button" might be helpful to prevent submit
[05:03:24] <Cork> though the correct solution would be to add the form tag, not remove the submit type
[05:03:24] <seutje> Grundell: that's the tricky part I'm not quite clear on... u can do fancy shit in CSS nowadays, but it's not very widely supported
[05:03:45] <serard> hello
[05:03:49] <Grundell> okay...
[05:03:55] <wild_oscar> doug65536, seutje: form is outside the snippet. I'm trying out this - http://federmanscripts.com/2010/01/12/form-and-table-row-nesting-workaround/
[05:03:56] <serard> anyone knows a masonry irc chan ? :)
[05:04:06] <Grundell> I'll simply look around and see if i can find something .. .
[05:04:18] <wild_oscar> which seems to be the only sane way to have one form per <tr>
[05:04:39] <seutje> wild_oscar: oh ok, cause without the form wrapper, there's no post behaviour you need to hijack
[05:05:06] <doug65536> wild_oscar: you aren't really submitting on every save are you? you should use ajax. last time I checked, it wasn't 1996 :D
[05:05:13] <DRSK> .on ('something', …) <- how can I first check if "something" exists? :)
[05:05:30] <Cork> DRSK: you can't
[05:05:32] <wild_oscar> I know this should probably work better without a table altogether
[05:05:55] <Cork> DRSK: not officially at least, there are some discouraged internal variables you could loop through
[05:06:02] <wild_oscar> doug65536: yup, this will probably evolve to an ajax call - I don't want to refresh the whole page on every save!
[05:06:37] <seutje> wild_oscar: whoa, that's awkward
[05:06:44] <wild_oscar> seutje: what is?
[05:06:58] <seutje> the empty satellite form
[05:07:41] <seutje> I usually just wrap the whole table in a form and see which button was pressed
[05:08:13] <seutje> sort of a .NET approach, but I lack a better solution
[05:08:24] <wild_oscar> seutje: see where? you don't submit all the rows, do you?
[05:08:49] <wild_oscar> say you have 10 rows, you click the 2nd save
[05:09:01] <doug65536> wild_oscar: if you use ajax, all these form nesting issues vanish from existence
[05:09:05] <pfFredd> Does anyone know of any sites with some nice flat templates for mobile web apps?
[05:09:06] <wild_oscar> what is actually submitted to the backend? the 2nd row's inputs?
[05:09:53] <wild_oscar> doug65536: what would your approach be? wrap the whole table with a form, or no form?
[05:10:08] <doug65536> wild_oscar: form is unnecessary with ajax post
[05:10:27] <seutje> wild_oscar: yeah, I do
[05:10:29] <wild_oscar> you'd still need the selector you mentioned earlier in the ajax method to include only those row's inputs, right?
[05:11:35] <wild_oscar> doug65536: ^^
[05:11:36] <doug65536> wild_oscar: what I said earlier with closest tr find :input not [type=button] will get you the controls. then scan through them with .each and use .attr('name') and .val() then submit it with $.post
[05:12:05] <jop008> I am using this http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#dropdown-month-year in the calendar I can only go back ten years so > 2003
[05:12:14] <wild_oscar> doug65536: yup, that'll work :)
[05:12:26] <jop008> how to make it wider to fill in a birth_date
[05:12:35] <doug65536> wild_oscar: what I typically do is set a data attribute on the row, with .data('pk', rowid)
[05:14:00] <doug65536> wild_oscar: which is easier when you use ajax to get the table content. I also typically have a row of markup in the table and use .detach() to pull it out in initialization, and use the name= field of the inputs and append the constructed row, for each item returned by the ajax
[05:14:21] <doug65536> wild_oscar: so I basically have a template in the markup and clone it for each row
[05:14:39] <jop008> answere https://forum.jquery.com/topic/can-datepicker-calendar-show-more-than-10-years
[05:15:44] <wild_oscar> doug65536: hmm..I'm going have to digest the "ajax to get the table content" bit, I lost you there :)
[05:16:16] <wild_oscar> (brb)
[05:16:39] <doug65536> wild_oscar: I have a row in the table that represents what a row looks like. then in my js, I .detach() it and store it to a variable. then in my "loadTable" function, I clone that thing, fill in the values, and .append it to the tbody
[05:16:52] <doug65536> wild_oscar: for each row
[05:17:17] <doug65536> wild_oscar: then, my design guy has freedom to do whatever and setup the appearance of the row. I just use the template he provides
[05:17:34] <knat> Can anyone suggest a good tutorial for writing ujs with jquery?
[05:17:46] <doug65536> wild_oscar: I try hard not to put html in my js
[05:19:03] <doug65536> wild_oscar: does that make sense?
[05:20:01] <doug65536> wild_oscar: design guy makes a row in the html. my code, during initialization .detach() it and save it to a variable. when adding a new row, I just .clone() that and append it
[05:20:09] <doug65536> wild_oscar: my code has no idea what the row looks like
[05:23:21] <doug65536> wild_oscar: it provides a clean separation between the backend database request (ajax/server side), the appearance of the row (html), and the UI code (js)
[05:30:40] <sahbeewah> you should consider some client-side templating such as dust.js or handlebars, doug65536
[05:31:23] <doug65536> sahbeewah: I don't do it by hand every time. I have a library
[05:38:27] <sahbeewah> granted, the library helps you, but there's still many underlying advantages of using something like dust.js... e.g. it's much cleaner for you and the designer, you can load dom blocks asynchronously, and have it cached, and it's faster
[05:38:42] <davesleeeep> how do am i able to say in jquery, click anywhere but this div
[05:39:43] <davesleeeep> got it
[05:40:24] <davesleeeep> nope, i dont
[05:41:14] <sahbeewah> davesleeeep, what are you trying to achieve?
[05:41:37] <sahbeewah> probably, $('body').not( $divElement ).doSomething
[05:42:12] <sahbeewah> no
[05:42:56] <doug65536> sahbeewah: how do you know it is faster? I don't even do ajax to get the row
[05:44:09] <davesleeeep> oh cheers
[05:44:22] <Cork> davesleeeep: mind a click handler on document, and look if the event.target is the element or a parent (in the even callback
[05:44:31] <Cork> mind==bind
[05:44:39] <seutje> mind the handler!
[05:44:48] <Cork> you don't want to bind event handlers on all the elements in the dom
[05:46:29] <doug65536> sahbeewah: I don't use off-the-shelf template stuff because it's like bootstrap. all great and easy as long as you are doing something they specifically support - or - a total nightmare if you step outside their lines
[05:46:30] <sahbeewah> hmm. might be a little trickier than that
[05:47:28] <lannes> doug65536: Thanks for your help earlier. It's still not working quite as expected, but your commentary was helpful along "best practices" lines. Thanks, man!
[05:47:31] <sahbeewah> particularly if one of its parents are positionally detached from its child
[05:49:23] <sahbeewah> doug65536, the initial speed is debatably faster; i'm pretty sure clone is really fast, but after caching you'll be much better off
[05:49:44] <sahbeewah> they're very lightweight, and logicless, and designed to solve exactly that problem
[05:49:51] <davesleeeep> hrm, aye,, it doesnt work, it's for a show() hide() popup box for login
[05:50:09] <davesleeeep> when i click, it clicks all the divs below it
[05:50:18] <davesleeeep> i could have a cancel button
[05:52:26] <Tumulte> when you add content thanks to ajax click don't work on new objects... is there a workaround
[05:52:27] <sahbeewah> davesleeeep, i think the typical solution to that is to have a click handler on the backdrop that closes it
[05:52:47] <sahbeewah> that's how i would solve it, anyway
[05:53:49] <BadgerUK> hello
[05:53:53] <sahbeewah> Tumulte, yes you can use delegated events - http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:54:03] <BadgerUK> i'm new to jquery and im slightly confused http://pastebin.com/7xSMvAQu
[05:54:09] <doug65536> Tumulte: the faq from hell lol. use parent.on('click', '..selector..', ...
[05:55:11] <davesleeeep> i tried to do that for the whole site container, but it clicks through
[05:55:15] <davesleeeep> if that makes sense?
[05:55:16] <wild_oscar> doug65536: back. yes, that concept of table population is quite interesting
[05:55:20] <davesleeeep> click all the elements below it
[05:55:39] <doug65536> davesleeeep: yes, it's called event bubbling
[05:55:53] <davesleeeep> i have e.stopPropagation();
[05:56:29] <doug65536> davesleeeep: that's the sledgehammer approach. it works
[05:56:50] <wild_oscar> might present some challenges in more complex tables (for instance, each cell on this table I'm building has slightly different look depending on what comes form the backend - e.g, whether you show a calendar, a text input,a select, etc)
[05:56:50] <sahbeewah> BadgerUK, when you make an $.ajax call, it is done asynchronously. so the function grabMembers() will not wait for fromDatabase() to return with a value before it returns
[05:57:30] <davesleeeep> it doesnt seem to work:/
[05:57:32] <wild_oscar> but I love the separation of concerns - it's a really bad idea to have .js depend on the html
[05:57:35] <doug65536> wild_oscar: what do you do about the column headings?
[05:57:49] <doug65536> wild_oscar: they become nonsense in that scenario, right?
[05:58:06] <wild_oscar> no, the heading is always the same
[05:58:16] <BadgerUK> sahbeewah: does that mean i can't do both things in jquery; i have to sperate my code between php and jquery?
[05:59:10] <doug65536> davesleeeep: your handler takes a parameter 'e' ?
[05:59:12] <sahbeewah> BadgerUK, no of course not! there is always a solution :)
[05:59:20] <sahbeewah> but you will have to restructure your code
[05:59:36] <davesleeeep> $('#container').on("click", function(e){ e.stopPropagation() }); ?
[05:59:47] <BadgerUK> sahbeewah: i am am empty vessel  ^_^
[05:59:49] <wild_oscar> th is populated based on the 1st element on the list retrieved from the backend
[05:59:52] <BadgerUK> an*
[06:00:01] <wild_oscar> (this is all done in jsp)
[06:00:05] <doug65536> davesleeeep: what elements are you wanting clicks from?
[06:01:02] <mvpgraff> I'm using the datepicker in the jquery-ui.js and set the dateFormat for yy-mm-dd, but still receive mm/dd/yy a few times, any ideas why?
[06:01:03] <doug65536> davesleeeep: #container leads me to believe that your elements are children of it
[06:01:29] <doug65536> davesleeeep: so, what you are doing appears to be nonsense. you are stopping it after it has already propagated there
[06:01:42] <sahbeewah> for the best solution however, you will unfortunately have to do a lot of reading on $.Deferred objects. Alternatively, structure it so that whatever is supposed to be done AFTER the grabMembers() call is done from inside the ajax success callback in fromDatabase()
[06:02:00] <davesleeeep> my issue is i dont know how to do 'click anywhere but this div'
[06:02:09] <sahbeewah> or the worst solution, you can add async: false into your ajax call
[06:02:11] <BadgerUK> sahbeewah: ty  <3
[06:02:36] <doug65536> davesleeeep: see if $(e.target).is('#container')
[06:03:10] <doug65536> davesleeeep: e.target will be the element where the event started
[06:04:04] <doug65536> davesleeeep: or, .is(this) in your specific scenario
[06:07:20] <doug65536> davesleeeep: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4YdS5/
[06:07:35] <Tumulte> doug65536: yes I've read that and used that... but still it only works with the non-ajax page
[06:09:57] <davesleeeep> can you explain why doug?
[06:10:06] <doug65536> davesleeeep: why what
[06:10:36] <davesleeeep> why the stopPropagation didnt work and that works?
[06:10:52] <davesleeeep> btw, my code was longer than what i posted, i just posted how i was doing the e.stopPropagation
[06:10:59] <doug65536> davesleeeep: because you called stopPropagation too late. it already propagated there by then
[06:11:09] <davesleeeep> ah okay
[06:12:07] <davesleeeep> thanks btw
[06:14:04] <davesleeeep> right yeah, that plus the .not, i now do this (to click outside of the login box).. $('body, body div').not('.loginform, .loginform div).function... blah
[06:14:09] <davesleeeep> that seem to work
[06:15:03] <davesleeeep> i should just js it, but it seem to work fine now, cheers again
[06:15:20] <FernandoBasso> If I have jQuery.ajax() inside another function, and I return true/false from sucess: function() {}, should that return value be visible to the function that called the outter function?
[06:16:35] <Tumulte> Sorry to reask this, but I'm really puzzled by on() and ajax. I know it's the thing to use and that the parent should be a non-modified element
[06:17:00] <Tumulte> but I can't make it work
[06:18:17] <FernandoBasso> This is the code: https://gist.github.com/FernandoBasso/5736966
[06:18:50] <sahbeewah> FernandoBasso, no, you are running into asynchronous problems, similar to what i just explained to badger above, you can scroll up and read ^
[06:19:29] <FernandoBasso> I see.
[06:19:52] <sahbeewah> Tumulte, what have you tried?
[06:20:41] <FernandoBasso> sahbeewah: I was doing the stuff from inside the success call back. But then I thought I would produce better code separating things... Thanks, though.
[06:21:55] <sahbeewah> FernandoBasso, yes you can use jquery's Deferred object to do exactly that
[06:22:09] <FernandoBasso> I'll read about. Thanks.
[06:22:59] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: http://paste.debian.net/48608/
[06:25:00] <mvpgraff> I'm using the datepicker in the jquery-ui.js and set the dateFormat for yy-mm-dd, but still receive mm/dd/yy a few times, any ideas why? http://jsfiddle.net/29AaV/
[06:25:01] <sahbeewah> where does it break down? does it execute the console.debug?
[06:25:07] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: ok get it
[06:25:11] <mvpgraff> datepicker doesn't work on jsfiddle for me :D
[06:25:25] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: there's a variable issue, it DOES work
[06:25:48] <dwarder> hello, i plan to have a jsonp service freely available to everyone, am i understand right that upon this request /api/data?callback=? i must serve something like this: ([{"data":1}]); and upon this request /api/data?callback=myfunc i must serve something like this myfunc([{"data":1}]);
[06:26:15] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: except playlist_items is in the on() function, and firebug tells me "undefined"
[06:26:28] <FernandoBasso> sahbeewah: Which deferred method would you advise in this case?
[06:26:47] <FernandoBasso> It seems that .done() is my best bet.
[06:26:48] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: sorry, I'm stupid, won't highlight you
[06:26:51] <Tumulte> again
[06:27:08] <dwarder> anyone? jsonp?
[06:27:10] <sahbeewah> mvpgraff, you have to set the correct settings in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/29AaV/1/ seems to work
[06:27:46] <mvpgraff> ahh, didnt even notice those settings
[06:28:03] <mvpgraff> anyways, when some one submits, 95% of the time I get the correct format
[06:28:20] <mvpgraff> but there's like 5% that comes in as mm/dd/yy
[06:28:36] <mvpgraff> any idea what that would happen?
[06:28:38] <sahbeewah> FernandoBasso, it's not about using a deferred method, it's using the concept of deferreds to control the flow of your logic
[06:29:35] <sahbeewah> mvpgraff, someone has js disabled / js doesn't load properly and types it in manually?
[06:29:40] <sahbeewah> could be anything, really
[06:29:56] * FernandoBasso is reading...
[06:30:26] <mvpgraff> sahbeewah, tried disabling my JS, and I can't seem to get it to work like that, I thought it may be a certain browser that doesn't register the dateFormat.
[06:30:44] <mvpgraff> but that 5% is a huge number for me, which is why I'm concerned lol
[06:32:28] <sahbeewah> if js is disabled it's just a text box, so people can type anything in, but that's probably not the case if you're getting 5%
[06:32:56] <sahbeewah> so, don't know... jquery ui is meant to be guaranteed to work with ie7+
[06:33:17] <mvpgraff> so, then I would have to go lower...... I'm scared.
[06:33:23] <serard> Anyone knows a jquery plugin or any js code which computes div sizes according to % ? (like in Flex programming language, mxml files, where we can say "take 100% of this horizontal group")
[06:33:27] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: maybe you know why my on("click"... says a variable set in the container page is ndefinded ?
[06:33:35] <Tumulte> undefined*
[06:34:30] <Corrado> mywebsite/profile  (in english) sorry
[06:34:34] <sahbeewah> Tumulte, is playlist_items within scope?
[06:35:26] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: it is when the page is loaded normally
[06:35:32] <Tumulte> not with ajax
[06:36:10] <steinarts> serard: css does that just fine
[06:36:28] <Kingsy> how would you submit a form using ajax if one of the strings being used in the form is a text box? So very very long?
[06:36:45] <Kingsy> atm I am using serialize() to form the data string, but this seems more like GET not POST.
[06:37:22] <sahbeewah> Tumulte, i don't follow. presumably playlist_items is something that gets defined globally, or in a parent function. why does the page loading matter?
[06:38:32] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: what I want to figure out precisely. Maybe cause the variable is set un body and not head
[06:38:52] <sahbeewah> Kingsy, what's the issue? the data string looks like a GET string?
[06:39:54] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: cause the ajax call strips my <script> that's why
[06:43:04] <sahbeewah> Tumulte, you have an ajax call which loads a <script> tag?
[06:44:17] <sahbeewah> sound kinda bad, but regardless it should work. if you check the ajax network tab in your developer tools you should find that it isn't being stripped
[06:44:21] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: a page containing a <script> tag yes
[06:44:34] <sahbeewah> the case is probably that you're using .html(html) - which strips script tags
[06:45:23] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: that's what I'm starting to think. This is a variable generated by my python's app template
[06:45:34] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: should go for external json files
[06:45:47] <Kingsy> sahbeewah: yeah, I assumed that a datastring for a POST form was not the same as GET
[06:47:16] <sahbeewah> Tumulte, yeah json is typically the way to go, and you build your dom from there. but if you are using .html(html), the hack you're probably looking for is $(container)[0].innerHTML = html;
[06:47:50] <sahbeewah> Kingsy, nope it's fine! but you can pass a javascript object into the data attribute of ajax, if that helps
[06:48:05] <Kingsy> sahbeewah: can you for example see a problem with this --> http://pastie.org/8372166 <-- I get an uncaught type error
[06:48:44] <Kingsy> obviously I subbed the url, haha I am not submitting a form to google
[06:49:04] <santiga> is it possible to access a parent dom element from within an iframe?
[06:49:30] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: I use filter('main') but still... reading a file is bet
[06:49:39] <Tumulte> sahbeewah: ter performance wise
[06:50:06] <sahbeewah> Kingsy, looks fine to me, except you should probably be alerting dataString, data shouldn't exist
[06:50:10] <sahbeewah> where are you getting the typeerror
[06:50:50] <Kingsy> sahbeewah: yeah the alert was just to check it was a string.
[06:50:54] <ohcibi> http://jsfiddle.net/ohcibi/dMB3Q/ why is the value of style.bottom empty?
[06:51:49] <sahbeewah> santiga, yes you can, given that they're on the same domain - i forget the syntax though, should be easily googlable
[06:51:55] <jedimind> ohcibi ##javascript
[06:51:58] <jedimind> none of that is jquery...
[06:51:58] <Kingsy> sahbeewah: it actually says "element=document.getElementById(element);return Element.extend(element);} has no method post
[06:52:11] <Kingsy> weird, maybe its not using jquery
[06:53:02] <Kingsy> sahbeewah: ah yeah it was that.. stupid no conflict
[06:53:25] <Kingsy> got it now.. but it says " Origin http://qp is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin"   http://qp  being my test dev virtual host
[06:55:17] <sahbeewah> yep cross-domain ajax sucks
[06:56:04] <Kingsy> sahbeewah: I don't really understand the error.. is it better to use $.ajax? or $.post? how do you get around the error there?
[06:56:52] <mvpgraff> jedimind: why does dateFormat sometimes send values as "mm-dd-yy" when I specifically set it for "yy-mm-dd" ;l
[06:57:00] <jedimind> i dont know, i dont use jquery-ui
[06:57:00] <jedimind> :)
[06:57:09] <mvpgraff> ass
[06:57:10] <mvpgraff> lool
[06:57:12] <mvpgraff> - -
[06:57:15] <mvpgraff> could of told me that
[06:57:36] <jedimind> you did one of these: var date = $('#datepicker').datepicker({ dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy' }).val();
[06:57:36] <jedimind> ?
[06:58:00] <sahbeewah> Kingsy, it means for security reasons, if you're on yoursite.com, you can't make an ajax call to someoneelsessite.com because they're on different domains
[06:58:12] <jedimind> mvpgraff you can also $.datepicker.formatDate('dd-mm-yy', dateTypeVar);
[06:58:14] <jedimind> when pulling the data
[06:58:18] <mvpgraff> http://jsfiddle.net/29AaV/1/
[06:58:20] <mvpgraff> i had done that
[06:58:23] <sahbeewah> just as http://127.0.0.1 is on a different domain to http://qp
[06:58:31] <Kingsy> why would you ever want to limit where a user can make an ajax call??? what the
[06:58:39] <jedimind> yeah, honestly, i stay away from jquery-ui so im not sure mvpgraff
[06:58:52] <mvpgraff> hmm
[06:58:55] <mvpgraff> thats why i had said
[06:59:00] <mvpgraff> it may be an issue with IE6
[06:59:02] <jedimind> Kingsy so that you're not making XH requests to sites you dont own ?
[06:59:09] <mvpgraff> i tested on every browser other than ie6 lol
[06:59:10] <jedimind> what do you mean
[06:59:33] <Kingsy> jedimind: well I am making an ajax post request to a site I don't own sure.
[06:59:35] <jedimind> Kingsy cross domain policies are long standing
[06:59:48] <jedimind> Kingsy read up about them before you make silly uninformed statements
[07:00:08] <Kingsy> hrm damn, so you cant make ajax requests across domains?
[07:00:12] <Kingsy> at all?
[07:00:13] <jedimind> sure you acan.
[07:00:14] <jedimind> GO

[07:10:10] <guest2> hi guys, im playing with an ajax here: http://pastebin.com/4Zuuu2W0
[07:10:36] <guest2> and it gives me Failed Request:error alert on changing the selectbox
[07:11:06] <guest2> and it does that only on one page, on another it works
[07:11:39] <guest2> and after returning from the another page, on wich it works, the html response remains cached and works on this also then
[07:12:13] <guest2> or i dont know if the responce remains cached or what but after returning to this page this works again, this is really strange
[07:14:05] <guest2> the responce normally cant be cached, cuz its dynamic, i dont know what does it caching on return to this page
[07:14:13] <guest2> MIME or what can be that?
[07:14:23] <guest2> anyone has any idea?
[07:18:13] <dwarder> hello, i plan to have a jsonp service freely available to everyone, am i understand right that upon this request /api/data?callback=? i must serve something like this: ([{"data":1}]); and upon this request /api/data?callback=myfunc i must serve something like this myfunc([{"data":1}]);  ?
[07:21:45] <FernandoBasso> .show() isn't working. $( this ).before( "<span class='inner-msg'>teste</span>" ).show( 'slow' ); <-- Any ideas?
[07:22:01] <FernandoBasso> If I use firebug, the span is there, display none.
[07:22:17] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: you're showing $(this)
[07:22:21] <NoiseEee> ?
[07:22:31] <FernandoBasso> I suspected that. Thanks.
[07:25:47] <guest2> ive figured out whats the problem
[07:26:44] <guest2> the websites url is www.something.com and the url defined in ajax is something.com so the www is missing, its cross policy, but i wonder how can i enable it to work with both www and not www?
[07:32:03] <wild_oscar> doug65536: on the .closest('tr').find(':input').not('button'), I forgot it would be a bit more complex when you have text input *and* type=radio, type=checkbox, select...
[07:32:32] <wild_oscar> in the multiple choice inputs, any way to filter out to "only the selected ones" in the same selector?
[07:33:20] <wild_oscar> or should I .find(:input[type='checkbox',checked]) for each type individually?
[07:37:26] <NoiseEee> wild_oscar: that selector isn't valid, is it?
[07:37:47] <wild_oscar> NoiseEee: no
[07:37:50] <NoiseEee> wild_oscar: i think you can also infer that anything "checked" is a checkbox, so you can skip looking for input[type='checkbox']
[07:38:02] <NoiseEee> wild_oscar: so .find('input:checked') should do fine.
[07:38:37] <NoiseEee> wild_oscar: but if you want to restrict to a particular name, then you can add that to the selector, sure
[07:40:13] <wild_oscar> NoiseEee: but if you're looking for, say "all text inputs AND all selected check/radio boxes (AND all selected dropdowns)"- would you achieve it in *one* find?
[07:40:21] <wild_oscar> or one for each?
[07:41:41] <RRR2> should I put forms in tables?
[07:42:32] <wild_oscar> RRR2: from current experience - not if you can avoid it ;)
[07:43:04] <wild_oscar> (and one form per row is invalid, so you need either one form per table or one form per <td>)
[07:44:15] <RRR2> not as the <form> tag inside a table, more like form elements, such as input, select, button, textarea in HTML forms
[07:44:16] <NoiseEee> wild_oscar: you can look at http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[07:44:32] <NoiseEee> RRR2: general consensus, no.  use CSS.
[07:44:51] <NoiseEee> wild_oscar: notice that only 'checked' things are passed.
[07:45:30] <RRR2> How do I get 2 rows of tags aligned? (Input description + input element)
[07:45:54] <wild_oscar> NoiseEee: hah. might be useful if I can serialize a row :)
[07:47:09] <NoiseEee> wild_oscar: oh, i forgot you were interested in a particular table row
[07:47:46] <wild_oscar> NoiseEee: does it only work for the complete form?
[07:47:48] <NoiseEee> RRR2: using css, wrapping in things other than a table... should be plenty of google results for 'formatting  a form in html markup without tables' or similar
[07:47:51] <NoiseEee> wild_oscar: yep
[07:49:03] <dwarder> guys what's the point in ? as a callback for jsonp callback?
[07:49:21] <dwarder> i.e. /api?callback=?
[07:49:35] <wild_oscar> NoiseEee: oh. bummer then
[07:49:37] <dwarder> as opposed to /api?callback=myfunc
[07:51:06] <dwarder> must i serve this '?' ?
[07:53:20] <ngharo> jquery will replace '?' with a generated function name it creates
[07:53:31] <ngharo> that in turn calls your success handler
[07:55:31] <dwarder> ngharo: so i don't need to serve '?' from my server
[07:55:58] <dwarder> ngharo: i can filter this simbol out
[07:56:01] <dwarder> ngharo: right?
[07:56:28] <dwarder> symbol*
[07:56:34] <ngharo> your server will not see '?'
[07:57:12] <ngharo> just try it out and inspect the callback get variable server side, or look at the request in your browser dev tools
[07:57:33] <ngharo> you'll see callback=jQuery23423424323blahblahblah
[07:57:35] <ngharo> something like that
[07:59:26] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm fading out a class in jQuery, but the callback executes for each element that's being faded out. How can I only run the call back one. What I'm trying to do looks somewhat like this: $('.group1').fadeOut('fast', function() { $('.group2').fadeIn('fast'); });
[07:59:47] <dwarder> ngharo: yes, i know this ... already, just want a confirmation that i can safely filter this '?' out
[07:59:50] <dwarder> ngharo: :)
[08:01:00] <dwarder> ngharo: thank you
[08:16:28] <doug65536> DeltaHeavy: var alldone = $('.group2').fadeOut('fast').promise(); alldone.done(function() { ... all fades are done... });
[08:17:11] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks, lemme try it
[08:19:38] <doug65536> allfades would have been a better name actually :)
[08:21:40] <Velveeta> you guys………………. i smell a trilogy…… http://i.imgur.com/tHpMsXG.jpg
[08:21:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is there a way to check with 1 line if all select boxes on a page have an option selected?
[08:22:42] <kaldrenon> I'm using Bootstrap, and in a given row I have a span10 and a span2. On an event, I want to animate turning them both into span6. How would I do that - I'm pretty sure I can't .animate() a removeClass(), can I?
[08:23:06] <doug65536> ecky--ptang-zoob: $('select').filter(function() { return $(this).val() == 0 }).length == 0
[08:23:14] <Velveeta> doug: nice
[08:23:51] <doug65536> :)
[08:24:11] <Velveeta> although wouldn't that fail in the case of a checked box with an actual value of zero?
[08:24:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Our true God in a third movie, wow
[08:24:25] <Velveeta> maybe do a return $(this).prop('checked') ?
[08:24:32] <doug65536> oops, missed length
[08:24:45] <doug65536> val().length
[08:24:52] <Velveeta> kaldrenon: yes, you can animate class toggles
[08:25:10] <doug65536> Velveeta: select has a checked property?
[08:25:24] <Velveeta> oh whoops
[08:25:28] <kaldrenon> Velveeta: Is it possible to do multiple class toggles in one animate?
[08:25:30] <Velveeta> i was reading it as checkboxes
[08:25:32] <kaldrenon> I didn't think it was.
[08:25:32] * Velveeta smacks himself
[08:26:04] <Velveeta> yeah, $.trim(.val()).length would probably be the way to go
[08:26:18] <Velveeta> because if selectedIndex is -1 for whatever reason, .val returns null i believe
[08:26:53] <Velveeta> i've seen those scenarios with stupid runat="server" attributes from our asp clowns
[08:27:00] <doug65536> ecky--ptang-zoob: updated $('select').filter(function() { return $.trim($(this).val()).length == 0; }).length == 0
[08:27:03] <doug65536> Velveeta: lol
[08:27:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> cool thx
[08:27:32] <Velveeta> kaldrenon: yep, if you animate class toggles, it will try to determine the properties of the class that are changing, and animate them individually
[08:39:59] <wild_oscar> NoiseEee: isn't serialize() better than serializeArray() if you're then posting it via ajax?
[08:40:11] <NoiseEee> wild_oscar: it is, if thats what you're doing
[08:40:22] <wild_oscar> (var x= (...).serialize() , ajax(data: x)
[08:40:33] <doug65536> wild_oscar: serializeArray is much better if you need to add or remove anything though
[08:41:25] <wild_oscar> doug65536: yup, that's true. is there any caveat to  data: $.param(myData) , as per suggested in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4862189/posting-jquery-serializearray-output-through-ajax ?
[08:41:38] <wild_oscar> if you use serializeArray() that is
[08:42:14] <doug65536> wild_oscar: what caveat
[08:42:43] <wild_oscar> any disadvantage to it
[08:43:35] <doug65536> oh, "is there". no
[08:44:20] <doug65536> wild_oscar: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/80538b04fd4ce8bd531d3d1fb60236a315c82d80/src/serialize.js#L45
[08:45:01] <fgh> they're actually the same
[08:47:10] <Tomashe> hey guys, how can i make things happened after animation end?
[08:47:34] <doug65536> Tomashe: they take a callback that is called when the animation is complete
[08:47:58] <doug65536> Tomashe: something.fadeIn('fast', function() { ... called when complete ... });
[08:49:53] <Tomashe> hmm
[08:50:00] <Tomashe> but that with fadein
[08:50:03] <Tomashe> how with animation?
[08:50:09] <doug65536> Tomashe: all of them are like that
[08:50:10] <Tomashe> $(".bottom-series li").animate({ right: "-=100px" },400);
[08:50:24] <doug65536> $(".bottom-series li").animate({ right: "-=100px" },400, function() { ....... });
[08:50:25] <Tomashe> $(".bottom-series li").animate({ right: "-=100px" },400,function(){ });
[08:50:26] <Tomashe> hmm
[08:50:33] <Tomashe> ok let me try that
[08:54:02] <Kingsy> question, if I have some js. like this jQuery.get("http://www.google.com/SOMEPLACEHOLDER/whatever",blah)...    inside a script tag randomly on the page..    is it possible to get another function to replace "SOMEPLACEHOLDER" with another string ?
[08:54:19] <Kingsy> given you cant find it using a regular selector because its not an element.
[08:56:50] <doug65536> lol. people are crazy. I'm looking at an SO question that basically asks, "what is the best way to submit 10,000 values to the server, using jquery
[08:57:13] <doug65536> XY question ftl
[08:57:26] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[08:59:27] <nicetry> Hey guys, on an jQuery.ajax -- what is the order of events between done/fail and always?
[08:59:34] <raghunayyar> in jquery if I have a method like td.children('a.name label.name'); is it correct first? will it search by both classes or either class will do?
[09:00:14] <nicetry> raghunayyar: I think you need a comma
[09:00:35] <raghunayyar> td.children('a.name','label.name');
[09:00:36] <raghunayyar> ?
[09:00:59] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/Dz6un/
[09:00:59] <raghunayyar> cc nicetry ^
[09:01:11] <Tomashe> im trying to create some kind of cycle but its not working
[09:01:12] <nicetry> haven't tested it in a while but I think - td.children('a.name, label.name');
[09:02:04] <nicetry> yeah, if you want both just a comma between them inside the quotes
[09:02:05] <Velveeta> nicetry: that's correct for searching for any of those items
[09:02:26] <Kingsy> is it possible to replace a string with another if the string is not inside or related to any element ?
[09:02:43] <Velveeta> nicetry: also, as far as done/fail/always, i *believe* it executes done/fail before always
[09:02:50] <Kingsy> i.e can you doa  find replace on html() ?
[09:02:57] <Velveeta> it should never have to decide between done and fail which to execute, because it's either gonna be one or the other
[09:02:59] <nicetry> Velveeta: that's what I thought too, but I couldnt' find any documenation on it so It hought I would ask
[09:03:20] * nicetry apparently can not type anymore
[09:03:49] <Velveeta> kingsy: are you talking about something like this? <p><span>blahblah</span> replace this string <span>blahblah</span></p> ?
[09:04:13] <Velveeta> something nested within an element, surrounded by other elements, but without a wrapper of its own to distinguish it?
[09:04:35] <raghunayyar> nicetry: I want either class to work not both.
[09:05:09] <Kingsy> Velveeta: no, the actual thing I want to replace is inside some <script> tags, its a url in a .get function
[09:05:10] <Velveeta> raghunayyar: then you'll probably have to run that as 2 selectors
[09:05:29] <Velveeta> kingsy: so you want to programmatically modify the content of some javascript?
[09:05:29] <Kingsy> Velveeta: so jQuery.get("http://www.google.com/SOMEPLACEHOLDER/whatever",blah)...   I wanna find replace SOMEPLACEHOLDER with var data
[09:05:41] <Kingsy> exactly.. as odd as that sounds yes
[09:05:42] <nicetry> Kingsy: why not set the URL as a variable, and then change the variable later
[09:05:49] <raghunayyar> I mean if td.children('.name, .name'); should work for both class1 and class2 if they are not together.
[09:05:55] <Velveeta> nicetry: that'd be the way to do it
[09:05:58] <raghunayyar> okay
[09:06:02] <Kingsy> nicetry: haha perfect thinkin
[09:06:03] <Kingsy> man
[09:06:42] <nicetry> hehe reflective js
[09:06:48] <Velveeta> raghunayyar: i'm still not following what you're wanting, try using some actual class names in your example
[09:07:22] <Kingsy> nicetry: oh, I cant do that.. the placeholder is used in a php function
[09:07:37] <nicetry> Kingsy: the placeholder?
[09:08:25] <Kingsy> nicetry: yeah, it generates a URL along with a key and some other things, the placeholder is taken by the php and put into the correct place in the URL.. if its blank the url would be wrong from php and the replace later with js would be pointless
[09:09:04] <nicetry> Kingsy:  do you have control over the php code?
[09:09:24] <Kingsy> nicetry: in a fashion yes, its third party.
[09:09:27] <Velveeta> kingsy: if you're having your php output a script block already, why can't you have it output a script block with a variable inline?
[09:09:45] <nicetry> That's what I was thinking
[09:09:51] <Kingsy> let me see if I can do it...
[09:09:53] <Kingsy> I hope so
[09:10:19] <nicetry> Kingsy: have php set each part of the url as a variable, then you can put the variables togeather in any way that you want in JS
[09:10:26] <Velveeta> like, instead of having it output: jQuery.get('myurl/SOMEPLACEHOLDER'), have it output something like: jQuery.get('myurl/' + somePlaceHolderVar)
[09:12:10] <Kingsy> Velveeta: that wouldnt work.. the function  looks like <?php echo $this->getUrl("some/base/string",Array("id","PLACEHOLDER"); ?> and the output is like http://whatever.com/index.php/some/base/string/id/PLACEHOLDER/key/sidogfsdjfoisdfjofkmsdiovcoidmj158615361/   <-- that is wrong but you get the idea.
[09:12:26] <Kingsy> the placeholder is not appended it is actually used in generating the url
[09:12:34] <Velveeta> gotcha
[09:13:05] <Kingsy> so I cant see another way other than using a find replace on html() ..
[09:13:24] <Velveeta> the only way to change that programmatically would be to get a handle to the script tag itself and do something like eval($('#myScriptTag').html().replace(/PLACEHOLDER/, 'somethingLegit')), but that's a really hideous solution
[09:13:43] <Kingsy> yep :(
[09:13:59] <Tomashe> question: can i makehttp://jsfiddle.net/Dz6un/3/
[09:14:03] <Tomashe> why that isnt working?
[09:14:21] <Velveeta> yes, you can make that jsfiddle link, and it appears you already have
[09:14:23] <sunbeam> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13059190/html5-css3-circle-with-partial-border
[09:14:27] <sunbeam> I'm looking for a way to define the border in percentages?
[09:14:28] <sunbeam> so I have a round circle, with a border
[09:14:31] <sunbeam> when the value is set to 1, the border should be 1% of the full circle
[09:14:34] <sunbeam> Anyone knows if such (jquery) exists?
[09:14:38] <nhulea> Tomashe: http://jsfiddle.net/Dz6un/3/ put a space in there
[09:14:50] <Kingsy> Velveeta: you can give id's to script tags? never done that before..
[09:15:00] <Velveeta> kingsy: yep, we do that for our handlebars templates
[09:16:56] <Velveeta> tomashe: it would also help if you told us what you're trying to accomplish
[09:17:41] <Tomashe> i told you, im trying to create some kind or cycle with the li's on click
[09:18:04] <Tomashe> on every click the li's animate and then the first one go to the end ..
[09:25:11] <Olive6767> Hi All :)
[09:25:39] <nicetry> Hi!
[09:27:49] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[09:28:09] <Olive6767> I'm using event delegation on a table, that is dynamicaly field after the page load. The problem is that I would like some actions to be trigered on an hover event on td cells of the table, however $('table').hover only fires when I enter the table. How can I use hover event delegation for table cells?
[09:28:10] <Bloomberg>  /msg NickServ IDENTIFY Bloomberg chicc!09
[09:28:25] <Olive6767> * filled Not field
[09:28:39] <Bloomberg>  /msg NickServ IDENTIFY Bloomberg chicc!09
[09:29:20] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg guess you get not get a new passwork.
[09:29:22] <kaldrenon> Is there a callback for when a $.each() finishes? I want some code to run when the whole loop is over, and putting it after the each doesn't seem to do that.
[09:29:22] <duch_kazatel> *password
[09:29:28] <Olive6767> Bloomberg: you've just posted your password publicly, you may want to resset it
[09:29:37] <nicetry> Olive6767: you can use jquery to select only what you want
[09:29:52] <nicetry> %('table td')
[09:29:58] <nicetry> $('table td')
[09:30:13] <jphase> o_0
[09:30:14] <nicetry> $('table td.class-that-i-want-to-do-things-when-i-hover-over-it')
[09:30:31] <Olive6767> nicetry, the table is filled after the script load, taht's why I'm using event delegation
[09:30:43] <doug65536> quick! identify as bloomberg and say something bad somewhere :D
[09:30:46] <Tomashe> why .done isnt working on jsfiddle?
[09:30:56] <nicetry> Olive6767: you can still call hover on the table and select any filled in elements that happen later
[09:31:06] <Bloomberg>  /msg NickServ IDENTIFY bloomberg chicc!09
[09:31:09] <Bloomberg> Shit
[09:31:14] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg you just did it again.
[09:31:15] <Bloomberg> What happen whit this?
[09:31:19] <Tomashe> ok
[09:31:19] <nicetry> Olive6767: like this  $('table').on('hover','td',function(){ ... });
[09:31:25] <duch_kazatel> you have a space in front of the first slash.
[09:31:35] <duch_kazatel> actually a few spaces.
[09:31:35] <kaldrenon> Olive6767: Try something like $(document).on('hover, 'table td.class', function(){});
[09:31:35] <Bloomberg> yes
[09:31:42] <Bloomberg> Shit, shit
[09:31:48] <Bloomberg> stupid login line
[09:32:07] <nicetry> Olive6767: as long as the table isn't replaced, any td's added later will be hovered
[09:32:32] <jphase> Bloomberg: you should setup auto identify buddy ;)
[09:33:21] <Olive6767> nicetry, kaldrenon: thx, trying now :)
[09:33:49] <Kingsy> Velveeta: you still there?
[09:33:49] <Bloomberg> jphase: how can  get it?
[09:34:00] <Velveeta> yepyep
[09:34:06] <Velveeta> working in another window
[09:34:11] <Velveeta> what's up
[09:34:12] <jphase> Bloomberg: do you use mIRC?
[09:34:13] <doug65536> Tomashe: link to fiddle?
[09:34:23] <Bloomberg> yes
[09:35:32] <Kingsy> Velveeta: that eval() doesnt seem to do anything, the url in the .get() function doesnt change.
[09:36:29] <doug65536> kaldrenon: you are probably crashing the script then. check your debugger console
[09:36:29] <jphase> Bloomberg: Ctrl + O, click "Connect" tab, and in the "Perform" box on the right type this:   /msg NickServ IDENTIFY bloomberg yourPassword
[09:36:39] <Bloomberg> How can I to change the css of submenu menu jquery ?
[09:36:52] <Bloomberg> jphase: thank you man
[09:36:55] <Bloomberg> well sugesstion!
[09:37:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: what up
[09:37:46] <Velveeta> kingsy: console.log the string it's trying to eval to make sure it's got the right thing it's trying to implement… also, being that this is running through jQuery.get directly, as opposed to some function wrapper for $.get, there's no way to cancel the first one that's been referenced, unless it resides in a function you can overwrite
[09:37:47] <doug65536> kaldrenon: errors aren't just some line in the debugger console. the browser abandons the rest of the script
[09:37:58] <jphase> hey there Rohan_Bhangui
[09:38:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> i thought of a logo
[09:38:11] <jphase> sweet!
[09:38:11] <Velveeta> what i mean by that is that if you have function foo() { $.get('/myurl/PLACEHOLDER'); ), you can overwrite function foo()
[09:38:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> the imac isnt gonna work
[09:38:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i made this arrow lookng thing
[09:38:40] <Velveeta> but if it's in the global scope as an executable line, the javascript parser is gonna just parse and execute that and there's nothing you can do about it
[09:38:46] <kaldrenon> doug65536: I actually realized my issue, and it was a foolish oversight on my part. I have an AJAX call in the code for the each, I was being dumb and assuming they would all be done when the loop exited.
[09:39:26] <kaldrenon> $.each() is behaving exactly how it should after all.
[09:39:30] <Kingsy> Velveeta: well the .html() is returning the correct <script> tags contents
[09:40:46] * jphase likes arrow looking things!
[09:40:57] <Kingsy> Velveeta: but the .replace("PLACEHOLDER","something else"); doesnt do a whole lot
[09:40:59] <Velveeta> can you paste those contents into a fiddle link?
[09:41:11] <Velveeta> i'd like to see what it's actually trying to eval
[09:41:59] <Kingsy> Velveeta: eval() says undefined
[09:42:29] <Velveeta> you said the html replaced string was outputting properly
[09:42:34] <Velveeta> *that's* what i'd like to see
[09:42:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: uploading right now
[09:42:53] <Kingsy> let me see if I can fiddle an example
[09:44:37] <nicetry> Does anyone here make use of each2 ?  http://jsperf.com/jquery-each2-vs-each
[09:45:03] <Bloomberg> jphase: man you know how to change the background-color of sub-level of jquery menu?
[09:45:38] <nicetry> I've read about it/ it looks good but I was wondering what other people thought about it.
[09:45:38] <Velveeta> each2 errors out for me in that jsperf
[09:45:42] <doug65536> nicetry: nice
[09:45:45] <jphase> Bloomberg: $('ul#menu > li > ul').css('background', 'pink'); ??
[09:46:05] <Velveeta> if the only problem it solves is reinitializing $(this) on each iteration, can't you just do that outside the loop?
[09:46:06] <doug65536> nicetry: yeah, it fails for me too
[09:46:06] <Kingsy> Velveeta: sorry about that --> http://jsfiddle.net/hsET4/
[09:46:28] <Velveeta> kingsy: i'd like to see the *replaced* value
[09:46:32] <nicetry> Velveeta: I had to reload a couple of times, I think jsperf is under heavy load or something
[09:46:37] <nicetry> this one worked for me http://jsperf.com/jquery-each2-vs-each/34
[09:46:38] <Kingsy> Velveeta: oops, the id in the eval is wrong, http://jsfiddle.net/hsET4/1/
[09:46:39] <Velveeta> the string that's actually being passed *into* eval
[09:47:02] <nicetry> but any of them _SHOULD_ work, alternatively google it?
[09:47:10] <Kingsy> Velveeta: sorry I don't know what you mean, thats the example.. as is
[09:47:16] <doug65536> nicetry: Refused to execute script from 'http://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/raw/master/jquery.ba-each2.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[09:47:36] <nicetry> ha
[09:47:48] <Velveeta> kingsy: so you said earlier "well the .html() is returning the correct <script> tags contents but the .replace("PLACEHOLDER","something else"); doesnt do a whole lot"
[09:47:49] <nicetry> fun with mime types
[09:48:04] <Velveeta> i want to see what's coming out from the result of the .html().replace() itself
[09:48:44] <Kingsy> Velveeta: does the fiddle show that --> console.log(eval($('#script_id').html().replace("PLACEHOLDER", "dsiofjsdoifjsdofisdjofi"))); <--  logs undefined
[09:49:15] <Velveeta> strip the evai off of that
[09:49:27] <duch_kazatel> woah eval wat
[09:49:29] <Velveeta> i *just* want to see the content that comes out of the replace function, what you're passing *into* eval
[09:49:39] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: i know, i know
[09:49:48] <doug65536> nicetry: lol, look how slow ipad is vs chrome/ff
[09:50:13] <Kingsy> Velveeta: the output is the same as .html()
[09:50:22] <Kingsy> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/hsET4/2/
[09:51:09] <Velveeta> forget it, i'll run it myself
[09:51:21] <Velveeta> because that fiddle link isn't what's coming out of it either, since it includes the script tag
[09:52:28] <Ritzton> Hello
[09:52:58] <doug65536> nicetry, Velveeta I fixed that jsperf test http://jsperf.com/jquery-each2-vs-each/36
[09:53:00] <Ritzton> Would you know how is it possible to post on a different port and to keep relative path ???
[09:53:54] <Kingsy> Velveeta: heh, man sorry I am not really sure what you mean... :(
[09:53:55] <Velveeta> so, yeah, each2 executes much faster for me, but it also breaks the interface of .each
[09:54:26] <nicetry> doug65536: nice!
[09:54:37] <nicetry> Velveeta: how so?
[09:54:58] <nicetry> More specifically how does it break the interface?
[09:55:52] <Velveeta> ok now i see wha tit's doing, so nevermind on that comment, but it also assumes that each 'this' is going to be a dom node
[09:56:16] <Kingsy> Velveeta: sorry to bother, but you got any idea whats wrong here? I am a little confused by this.
[09:56:16] <Velveeta> which i guess is a safe enough assumption as long as the dev doesn't try to just blindly to replace all .each() references with .each2
[09:56:24] <Velveeta> kingsy: i'm working on yours still
[09:56:29] <Kingsy> ah sorry
[09:57:18] <doug65536> Ritzton: function addPortToLocation(port) { return location.protocol + '//' + location.hostname + ':' + port + location.pathname + location.search; }
[09:57:51] <doug65536> Ritzton: the location.search contains the query parameters from the current page - you might want to remove it
[09:58:19] <Velveeta> kingsy: that replace function works fine, but it's only replacing the first instance of PLACEHOLDER that it finds
[09:58:40] <nicetry> Velveeta: yes, really the only advantage is when you are using jQuery(this) inside the each
[09:58:42] <Velveeta> you need to restructure that to be something more like this: .replace(/PLACEHOLDER/g, 'lskdjflskfdjslkdfj')
[09:58:44] <nicetry> thats where the speed happens
[09:59:21] <duch_kazatel> yeah .each2() is only good if you need to use $(this).
[10:00:22] <Velveeta> nicetry: yeah, neat tactic, overwriting the 0-index of the already-established array
[10:00:48] <Kingsy> Velveeta: that still doesnt work for me
[10:01:24] <Velveeta> this is why i need to see the exact script tag you're trying to replace the contents of, and the exact string that's being run through eval
[10:01:52] <Kingsy> ohh there got it
[10:02:02] <Kingsy> Velveeta: you were right, thanks
[10:02:10] <Velveeta> ok cool
[10:02:19] <Velveeta> so, now that that's working, i feel i should drop this disclaimer
[10:02:23] <Velveeta> eval sucks, don't use it :D
[10:02:26] <Ritzton> doug65536> why something like that is not working : http://pastebin.com/tL9PG2wf ?
[10:02:53] <doug65536> Ritzton: because target is the DOM element
[10:03:16] <doug65536> Ritzton: you are setting a property on the form element called 'port' and assigning 3000
[10:03:18] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Ritzton
[10:03:18] <b-ot> Ritzton: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:03:55] <Kingsy> Velveeta: thanks so much for your help with that.
[10:04:06] <Velveeta> no problem, don't forget to read the disclaimer
[10:04:16] <Kingsy> heh ok
[10:04:38] <Ritzton> doug65536> I dont really like your first solution.. isnt it a way to only change the port ? window.location.port=8080 ?
[10:05:13] <doug65536> Ritzton: that would be great if you wanted to reload the page at that port
[10:06:22] <Ritzton> doug65536> I didnt get why what I wrote in the pastebin doesnt work
[10:06:29] <doug65536> Ritzton: actually, it has no effect
[10:07:19] <doug65536> Ritzton: if a solution that works isn't to your liking, do it some other way
[10:07:37] <doug65536> Ritzton: actually, assigning to port does reload the page at that address
[10:07:38] <Velveeta> if the solution you want, doesn't work, it doesn't leave much choice
[10:07:49] <Ritzton> doug65536> well yeah it has no effect, but how to make it work ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6016120/relative-url-to-a-different-port-number-in-a-hyperlink
[10:08:07] <doug65536> Ritzton: I just gave you a way to compute the url at a certain port
[10:08:10] <Ritzton> they are doing that here : <a href="/other/" onclick="javascript:event.target.port=8080">Look at another port</a>
[10:08:21] <doug65536> Ritzton: trust me, SO isn't the greatest source of information for jquery
[10:08:49] <duch_kazatel> ewww onclicks in markup.
[10:08:50] <duch_kazatel> :(
[10:09:07] <doug65536> Ritzton: the way that "answer" does it is ridiculous compared to what I suggested
[10:09:43] <Ritzton> doug65536> you are building an absolute url
[10:10:01] <doug65536> Ritzton: so?
[10:10:29] <Ritzton> doug65536> you didnt answer why the thing I just wrote doesnt work for forms and it works for links ?
[10:10:43] <Velveeta> who cares what the url looks like when it ships… it gets resolved to absolute by the browser even if you specify it as relative
[10:11:28] <doug65536> Ritzton: use my function, use .serialize() on the form, and submit it with ajax. unless you wanted to reload the page
[10:12:29] <doug65536> Ritzton: if you did want to, just $(event.target).attr('action', <call my suggested function>)
[10:13:30] <doug65536> Ritzton: what part of my function did you not like? it exactly emulates what really happens when you post without an action
[10:14:15] <Ritzton> doug65536> I think what you first wrote is dirty and doesnt fit my needs sorry and why do you want me to post my form with ajax ?
[10:14:16] <doug65536> Ritzton: you did mean to post to the same url as the current page, right?
[10:14:38] <Ritzton> doug65536> no it is a different url
[10:14:52] <doug65536> Ritzton: then what's the question?
[10:15:10] <doug65536> Ritzton: you can't do string concatenation and you call my function dirty. come on?
[10:15:13] <bberry> hey guys.  I just got jquery and am using something called select2 (it just makes a nice pretty <select> for me).  Anyway, in the console i am getting a 404 on jquery.min.map.  I found the map file and included it and it works fine.  My question is what exactly is the map file?
[10:15:59] <bberry> is it similar to like what a c/c++ map file is
[10:16:22] <Ritzton> doug65536> I have a simple form <form action="/toto" method="post"> and I want to post it on 3000 port instead of the actual one
[10:17:38] <duch_kazatel> Ritzton you can't...
[10:17:42] <Ritzton> doug65536> on SO <a href="/other/" onclick="javascript:event.target.port=8080">Look at another port</a> seem to work according to the feedbacks, so why it does not work with a form ?
[10:18:00] <Ritzton> duch_kazatel> why I can't ?
[10:18:05] <duch_kazatel> Ritzton you cannot post to a different domain, subdomain, or port number.
[10:19:02] <Ritzton> duch_kazatel> why ?
[10:19:08] <duch_kazatel> security.
[10:20:21] <Ritzton> duch_kazatel> so the only solution is to post to an absolute url with the correct port ?
[10:21:12] <duch_kazatel> Ritzton you need to post to the same domain.  you could setup a server-side daemon to handle the rest.  you can also use relative URLs since it's going to the same domain.
[10:21:47] <duch_kazatel> it's a big issue having the client-side post to a different domain/subdomain/port.  once it hits your server you can do whatever.
[10:22:12] <bberry> nevermind. i found out what a map file is.
[10:22:17] <doug65536> bberry: a map file is a file that lets a script debugger convert a minified js file back to a readable source file. it is unnecessary
[10:22:27] <bberry> pretty much the same thing as a c/cpp project
[10:22:31] <doug65536> bberry: in chrome you can turn that feature off
[10:22:31] <bberry> yeah
[10:23:57] <Ritzton> duch_kazatel> because my original problem is I made a game, I am using apache proxy mod and var socket = io.connect('https://'+window.location.hostname+':3000'); for websockets, it works on desktop pc but for some reasons it does not work on mobile, it has to be the same port to works that's why I want to change the post to enter the game
[10:24:29] <doug65536> Ritzton: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect
[10:25:41] <Ritzton> doug65536> thinking your solution is dirty doesnt mean I am ill
[10:26:07] <modcure> $(document).on('click', '#SelectAllChk', function(){});  <-- im using that method but when i click checkbox nothing happens.. i have alert('true') in the function. any idea why ?
[10:26:42] <duch_kazatel> modcure jsfiddle?
[10:26:50] <JLT> Hello. I'm using jquery + jquery ui and I'm trying to do something. http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/ basically when you hover over the panda, it will open up 3 menus. When you hover off the panda, it will close them.

Also, when you move from the menu back to the panda... it shoul
[10:27:21] <k-g> Hi, could somebody write a snippet so that it checks if a div has class .view-content-infinite-scroll it hides ul.pager?
[10:27:39] <duch_kazatel> k-g lol why would we write that for you?
[10:27:46] <duch_kazatel> and we'd need context?
[10:28:01] <duch_kazatel> *.
[10:28:03] <modcure> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/JF4PK/
[10:28:21] <k-g> I have an infinite scroll container with a pager as fallback
[10:28:42] <k-g> I want to hide the pager via jquery so that the pager is only visible for ppl without js
[10:28:43] <duch_kazatel> modcure dude... http://jsfiddle.net/JF4PK/1/ - start there.
[10:28:52] <duch_kazatel> like, you need to actuappyl provide a full example.
[10:29:02] <JLT> It's a tricky task, whoever can make it do what I wish wins a virtual medal. ;)
[10:29:22] <doug65536> modcure: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/JF4PK/2/
[10:30:16] <modcure> doug65536, that doesnt work in IE but chrome yes
[10:30:25] <modcure> i cant get it to work in IE that's the issue
[10:30:39] <doug65536> modcure:  use jquery 1.10.x
[10:31:00] <doug65536> modcure: jquery 2.x doesn't support IE
[10:31:03] <duch_kazatel> doug65536 still doesn't work in IE.
[10:31:12] <duch_kazatel> wait what?  that sounds wrong.
[10:31:15] <modcure> using jquery 1.7.2
[10:31:37] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: 2.x gets rid of all the compat crap and uses modern functions
[10:31:43] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: it only works on very recent ie
[10:31:44] <duch_kazatel> http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[10:31:51] <duch_kazatel> jQuery 2.x supports 9+
[10:31:58] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/JF4PK/2/ does not work in IE10.
[10:32:36] <doug65536> duch_kazatel modcure file a bug
[10:32:36] <snover> “doesn’t support IE” and “doesn’t support IE8 and earlier” are two extremely different things
[10:32:38] <snover> the first one is dumb
[10:32:40] <snover> the second one is smart
[10:33:32] <Ritzton> doug65536> you didnt answer me why is it working for links : <a href="/contact" onclick="javascript:event.target.port=3000"> and it is not working for forms ???
[10:33:49] <k-g> http://jsfiddle.net/v65rd/
[10:33:49] <duch_kazatel> Ritzton don't put onclick in markup like that.
[10:34:07] <k-g> I have written my problem @ jsfiddle
[10:34:37] <Ritzton> duch_kazatel> sorry ?
[10:35:04] <duch_kazatel> Ritzton it's bad practice.  bind events using javascript.
[10:35:36] <s2013> for some reason i cant seem to pass value to a hidden input field. i tried $("input[id=ticketTime]").val(Date.now)
[10:35:44] <s2013> and $("ticketTime").val(Date.now)
[10:36:00] <JLT> http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/1/ this is a smoother working version, the original I was given with. However the events are chained... hovering back and forth on the logo will cause the menus to become pogo sticks! I tried my best to stop that (on my original request for help) but it made it look worse. This is the starting point.
[10:36:02] <s2013> neither of them sets a value for the hidden field
[10:36:16] <JLT> Can anyone help me stop it acting like a pogostick. XD
[10:36:36] <Ritzton> duch_kazatel> well I know that, I can write if you want $(document).on('click', '#link', function(event) { event.target.port=3000; }
[10:37:39] <duch_kazatel> k-g here's your dirty solution: http://jsfiddle.net/v65rd/1/
[10:38:12] <duch_kazatel> k-g that's pretty inelegant but does exactly what you asked.
[10:38:15] <Tumulte> how come this show me the get in the console... but not the debug
[10:38:23] <Tumulte> http://paste.debian.net/48792/
[10:38:42] <modcure> duch_kazatel, doug65536  how can i get it to work in ie 9 and ie 10 ?
[10:38:46] <k-g> dutch_kazatel: thank you but for what is > 0?
[10:38:59] <k-g> What length is being checked?
[10:39:15] <duch_kazatel> k-g that checks to see how many matches that selector found.
[10:39:30] <duch_kazatel> if any exist, hide .pager.
[10:39:52] <k-g> So it checks the whole document at first, then hides it?
[10:40:04] <duch_kazatel> yes.  that's why it's hacky.
[10:40:37] <k-g> Thought there is a solution which hides it directly if it found the first matching class
[10:41:06] <duch_kazatel> k-g without more context i can't really help.
[10:41:43] <Ritzton> nobody knows why $(document).on('click', '#link', function(event) {  event.target.port=3000; }) is working for links but not for posting forms ?
[10:42:07] <duch_kazatel> Ritzton again, cross domain.
[10:42:18] <duch_kazatel> you can NOT post to a different domain, subdomain, or port.
[10:42:19] <duch_kazatel> period.
[10:42:21] <duch_kazatel> end of story.
[10:42:57] <Ritzton> duch_kazatel> so you can GET but not POST ? end of the story ?
[10:43:33] <duch_kazatel> you can't do either.
[10:43:39] <duch_kazatel> you need to learn about cross-domain,
[10:46:13] <poutine> duch_kazatel, I think you need to a little as well, it's perfectly valid to post a form to other domains, it's not perfectly valid to send a json cross domain, it is via jsonp, pixel requests, etc
[10:46:34] <Ritzton> duch_kazatel> sorry but I did <a href="/game" id="toto">game</a> and then $(document).on('click', '#toto', function(event) {  event.target.port=3000; }); and it works at least with chrome, firefox and internet explorer so your theory is wrong
[10:46:45] <Ritzton> I have TESTED it
[10:48:12] <Ritzton> poutine> thank you for defending me, duch_kazatel and doug65536 think I am stupid
[10:48:44] <doug65536> modcure: does this work in IE http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/JF4PK/3/
[10:49:11] <Ritzton> poutine> what would be your solution to post the form to another port please ?
[10:49:37] <modcure> doug65536, didnt work :(
[10:49:51] <doug65536> modcure: I don't believe it

[10:51:49] <modcure> doug65536, thank you. you will see :)
[10:53:44] <defk0n> can someone help me, i think im going crazy. Why cant i access global variables inside jquery.ajax() function?

[10:57:42] <doug65536> defk0n: it's javascript doing that
[10:58:00] <gnarf> defk0n: first of all
[10:58:14] <gnarf> defk0n instead of "eindex" were you hoping for the value of eindex?
[10:58:23] <defk0n> yer
[10:58:26] <defk0n> gnarf yes
[10:58:28] <doug65536> modcure: jquery crashes before any of my code runs
[10:58:32] <gnarf> if so, you have to use square bracket notation, you can't define a key like that
[10:58:34] <JLT> http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/1/ this is a smoother working version, the original I was given with. However the events are chained... hovering back and forth on the logo will cause the menus to become pogo sticks! I tried my best to stop that (on my original request for help) but it made it look worse. This is the starting point.
[10:58:42] <Ritzton> how is it possible to post a form on a different port please keeping relative path ?
[10:58:49] <gnarf> { aKey: "test" } is { "aKey": "test" }
[10:59:28] <gnarf> defk0n i will keep pointing out things to you if you wish
[10:59:39] <defk0n> gnarf im confused, y does it work for title, summary,image
[10:59:42] <defk0n> but not for eindex
[10:59:49] <defk0n> gnarf yer please. im loosing my mind
[11:00:03] <gnarf> defk0n: left side of the ':' is a key, right side is an expression(and is evaluated)
[11:00:32] <gnarf> defk0n: var test = 1; console.log( {test: test} );
[11:00:39] <gnarf> `eval var test = 1; console.log( {test: test} );
[11:00:43] <gnarf> `js var test = 1; console.log( {test: test} );
[11:00:48] * gnarf shrugs
[11:00:52] <gnarf> run it in your console
[11:00:58] <defk0n> gnarf ohhh..
[11:01:41] <gnarf> defk0n: so you need to do like var output = {}; output[eindex] = {...}
[11:01:45] <defk0n> gnarf so how do i let the key evaluate
[11:01:54] <gnarf> ^ square bracket notation
[11:02:16] <gnarf> second of all, you are wasting a bunch of time/work in this method
[11:02:37] <JLT> Would someone kindly help me out here?
[11:02:49] <defk0n> gnarf oke thanx, how is that?
[11:02:50] <gnarf> you might want to start out with var $this = $(this); - or even what I prefer even more, making it a sane name: var header = $(this);
[11:03:02] <nexxy> gnarf, o hey
[11:03:16] <gnarf> every call to $() is a call to a function, and no need to do this - cache the value from the first call
[11:03:22] <gnarf> and work on it
[11:03:32] <gnarf> on line 23 of your paste, you are parsing $(response)
[11:03:34] <gnarf> and then you parse it again
[11:04:15] <gnarf> so like var parsed = $(response); parsed.find.....
[11:04:21] * gnarf hugs nexxy 
[11:04:47] * nexxy hugs
[11:05:16] <gnarf> defk0n: basically - you can clean this up a lot
[11:05:18] <defk0n> gnarf thanks. the index now gives me a value but window.season is still undefined
[11:05:42] <gnarf> defk0n why are you using window.season instead of just var season ?
[11:05:59] <defk0n> gnarf yer i basiically wrote this against a website so i dont have to click and paste everything. its dirty iknow. but it took me way to much writing this :(
[11:06:15] <gnarf> you do realize that functions declared in later scopes do inherit the scope of the parent… i.e. your callback can see "index"
[11:06:29] <gnarf> because it is "inside" the same scope
[11:07:10] <gnarf> defk0n: if you take another 15 minutes to clean it up you might learn a few things that will save you time later - and I'm offering - I give up whenever you do ;)
[11:08:25] <defk0n> gnarf i appreciate your help, always learning new stuff. i did window.season because in a effort to fix undefined. it still gives me undefined though.
[11:08:27] <defk0n> local or global
[11:08:48] <defk0n> gnarf window.a2[window.season][eindex] = {'title':title, 'teaser':summary, 'image':image};
[11:09:02] <gnarf> defk0n: so - next step - can you tell me what the purpose of this code is
[11:09:30] <gnarf> all i see is a bunch of selectors and some ajax - i need to know why / what problem you are solving
[11:09:36] <gnarf> and the purpose of window.a2
[11:10:27] <defk0n> gnarf pmed you
[11:11:12] <gnarf> defk0n: so basically, you are scraping some data?
[11:11:17] <defk0n> gnarf yes
[11:11:46] <gnarf> okay - what does the output of this data look like in your vision
[11:11:57] <gnarf> can you gist/paste a json?
[11:12:34] <defk0n> {season 1 : { eindex(episode/table row: {title,image,summary)}
[11:12:50] <defk0n> {season 1 : { eindex(episode/table row): {title,image,summary)}
[11:13:16] <defk0n> because i have to ajax i cant just wack it all together ineed the index
[11:13:24] <defk0n> to know which episodes chronologically
[11:13:36] <gnarf> sure
[11:13:54] <gnarf> so key 1 is season
[11:14:50] <defk0n> yes. have you pasted that code inside console?
[11:14:59] <defk0n> it should work...
[11:15:03] <defk0n> sort off
[11:15:26] <gnarf> defk0n :)
[11:19:14] <Tumulte> My getjson fails... but I can't get a reason. Here's the call and the .json file http://paste.debian.net/48815/
[11:33:08] <glosoli> Any  jQuery File Upload users ?
[11:36:58] <gnarf> defk0n: take a look at https://gist.github.com/gnarf/71002b8605478a4448c5
[11:37:51] <gnarf> defk0n: please ask questions about it
[11:38:15] <defk0n> gnarf give me a second, reading
[11:40:17] <gnarf> defk0n: it pulls out a lot of little tricks - but generally leads to a more readable / reusable solution I think
[11:41:38] <gnarf> defk0n: $.when.apply is probably one of the weird ones for you - $.when( $.ajax(), $.ajax() ).done(function() { console.log('both ajax done'); });
[11:41:51] <gnarf> using .apply - you can take an array( returned from map ) and say "when all the ajax calls are done"
[11:42:40] <defk0n> gnarf  its beautifull.
[11:42:53] <gnarf> episodes.map returns a $.ajax, $.when rolls it all up into one
[11:42:57] <defk0n> gnarf some next level stuff right man. need to read more
[11:43:16] <gnarf> keeping variables scoped properly makes it way easier to look around and edit the data you want
[11:43:17] <gnarf> for instance
[11:43:24] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/gnarf/71002b8605478a4448c5#file-gistfile1-js-L6
[11:43:31] <gnarf> season.text() isn't even needed again
[11:43:44] <gnarf> because you just reference the same object later as seasonOutput
[11:44:14] <gnarf> less nesting, less complex selectors
[11:44:20] <gnarf> easier loops that return meaningful things
[11:45:12] <gnarf> defk0n: and I always love writing a good screen scraper
[11:45:14] <gnarf> :)
[11:46:47] <libin> i am using a jquery ajax function, but getting a failure immediately
[11:46:53] <libin> help please
[11:47:28] <gnarf> `code @libin
[11:47:28] <b-ot> libin: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:47:28] <libin> <script>          $(document).ready(function () {             $('#update').click(function () {                 $.ajax({                     type: 'Post',                     url: '/umbraco/Surface/Filter/FranchiseForSale',                     data: { region: $("#Region option:selected").text(), service: $("#Service option:selected").text() },                      success: function (data) {                         window.location = "/
[11:47:59] <defk0n> gnarf what does season = $(this); refer to with map?
[11:48:12] <libin> http://jsfiddle.net/nMTue/
[11:48:18] <libin> thats the jsfiddle
[11:48:55] <gnarf> defk0n - map and each are very similar, map returns a new collection from the return values… $(this) is therefore each table.find('tr th a');
[11:49:05] <gnarf> so each <a> for season
[11:49:20] <gnarf> hence season.text() = 'Season 1'
[11:49:30] <gnarf> s/=/==/
[11:49:46] <gnarf> season.parent() is the <th>
[11:49:48] <gnarf> etc
[11:50:00] <libin> b-ot : would you know why would it happen
[11:50:42] <gnarf> b-ot: why would that happen?
[11:50:42] <b-ot> gnarf: very doubtful.
[11:51:24] <libin> gnarf: this is my file http://jsfiddle.net/nMTue/
[11:51:40] <gnarf> libin: what does the console say?
[11:52:10] <libin> the moment i hit the button, it hit the failure
[11:52:24] <gnarf> libin: what does the console say?
[11:52:35] <gnarf> what is the status of the network request?
[11:52:44] <libin> there is no error in console
[11:52:59] <gnarf> look in the network tab?
[11:53:05] <gnarf> is there a request?
[11:53:09] <gnarf> what is it's status?
[11:53:55] <libin> first the post method shows as pednding and cancel
[11:54:34] <libin> status : pending
[11:55:14] <libin> type: cancel
[11:56:58] <gnarf> defk0n: you able to grok all that yet? or did I break your mind? :)
[11:57:15] <defk0n> gnarf you broke it alright ^_^
[11:57:29] <gnarf> defk0n keep asking questions - i can make it make sense
[11:57:30] <defk0n> gnarf its a work of art
[11:57:57] <defk0n> gnarf im getting their
[11:59:39] <libin> gnarf : any clue about my one
[11:59:57] <gnarf> libin: nope
[12:00:03] <libin> ok
[12:00:23] <defk0n> gnarf what does (episodeNumber) refer to?
[12:02:55] <t432> How do I get rid of this error?

[12:03:23] <BrianB> i have a question, i'm using jquery ui modal, and it seems to not use the site CSS on the content in the modal. is that normal or?
[12:03:38] <doug65536> modcure: I don't know if microsoft broke it or something, but the latest dev build of jquery works on IE for me
[12:04:08] <JLT> I am off to sleep but I'll leave you all with a task. http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/2/ All menus should close when user is not mouseenter'ed any of the 3 menus or the main orb itself. Hovering over the vertical or the horizontal menu, should slide in the other... until you go on the orb and it'll open back up. The tiny horizontal menu doesn't count. Hovering on that should keep all menus open just like the orb itself. Very tricky situation but I am
[12:04:40] <duch_kazatel> JLT Seriously?
[12:04:44] <t432> anyone?
[12:04:45] <duch_kazatel> we're not going to do it for you.
[12:04:53] <doug65536> yay! a task
[12:04:57] <JLT> I've been asking for help for ages duch_kazatel and I've been ignored.
[12:05:13] <JLT> I have no idea what I'm to do... I've tried everything I can think of and just nobody is assisting me.
[12:05:14] <duch_kazatel> JLT right, because we're not going to do it for you.
[12:05:22] <JLT> I never asked to do it for me in the first place and nobody helped.
[12:05:50] <doug65536> JLT: I must say, it's pretty neat
[12:06:05] <t432> JLT: The room bleeds for you.
[12:06:12] <JLT> it's meant to work like /1/ but... it's all chained and if you hover off a menu it'll close and re-open. and bleh.
[12:06:20] <JLT> the original was my attempt to stop the chaining and it's just a retard.
[12:06:40] <duch_kazatel> t432 sounds like you havent's inited the autocomplete setup.  that'd be my guess
[12:06:40] <JLT> So I started from scratch with the jquery and now it doesn't do a thing.
[12:09:36] <duch_kazatel> JLT your code conflicts itself btw.  you're telling in on mouseleave to hide your menus, but then on mouseenter on said menus to show them,.
[12:10:19] <JLT> yeah I kinda wanted the menu you put yuour mouse on, to stay open.
[12:10:24] <doug65536> JLT: almost http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/hvpaY/3/
[12:10:25] <JLT> the other chunky menu to close.
[12:10:46] <guideX> with jquery chosen, when I modify my select list, then call .trigger('chosen:updated');  , I have duplicated items
[12:11:05] <defk0n> dough65536 nice
[12:11:07] <duch_kazatel> JLT right, but think about the order of operations there ;)  you need to add in some conditions.  otherwise you're basically making a queue.
[12:11:29] <Bloomberg> someone here know s how is the structure of levels jquery menu?
[12:12:13] <JLT> dough65536 yeah all the events are chained... it's close to what I'm after... it was near the originall actually, in /1/ of my fiddle. Moving from a menu back to the orb will cause it to close and then open... I don't like  that happening, and then if you keep going over the orb it'll cause a chain and yeah.. becomes a pogo stick ;p
[12:12:21] <JLT> doug65536: ^
[12:13:15] <doug65536> JLT: closer, but it goes crazy after a few iterations  http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/hvpaY/4/
[12:13:56] <JLT> yeah all the positoning has moved. .stop(true, true) stops that but then it's all jumpy.
[12:14:32] <duch_kazatel> you need to add conditionals to the mouseleave events to see where the move currently is.
[12:15:30] <doug65536> JLT: I think you need to take more responsibility for it and not rely solely on slideUp and slideDown
[12:16:30] <JLT> all I know is that it's crazily complex. I'm just clueless. I can do simple things with ease but this is rediculous.
[12:16:34] <doug65536> JLT: you see what I did with the timeout though right?
[12:16:53] <duch_kazatel> it's not complex.
[12:17:21] <duch_kazatel> it's actually pretty simple.  on your mouseleave event, check to see if the mouse entered somewhere else.
[12:17:37] <duch_kazatel> define functions for showing/hiding the different menus, then call those based on criteria.
[12:17:38] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: I already solved that part
[12:17:58] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: problem is if you interrupt the slide up/down it malfunctions
[12:18:47] <duch_kazatel> (i'm trying to help them do it so they do it themselves)
[12:19:32] <JLT> doug65536: explain the timeout?
[12:20:23] <doug65536> JLT: when you mouseout the main circle, it sets a timeout to do the slideups after 250ms. if you mouseenter one of those things that flyout, it cancels the timeout
[12:20:34] <doug65536> JLT: ah, I have an idea...
[12:20:59] <JLT> i literally just figured that out. It's hard to focus when you're half asleep but yeah it does make sense.
[12:21:08] <JLT> Been trying to hours ;p
[12:22:01] <duch_kazatel> i'm personally not a fan of timeouts when I can avoid them.
[12:22:44] <guideX> nm, jquery chosen is working fine :)))
[12:22:54] <guideX> my code was appending duplicate items to the select list
[12:23:01] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: ok, go ahead and avoid it. I'd like to see it
[12:23:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to do it for them ;)
[12:23:50] <JLT> duch_kazatel: your method, would it be to have an object of elements mouseover state, change to true if the mouse is over... then when the elements are due to close... eh...
[12:23:54] <JLT> hmm
[12:24:18] <JLT> maybe a small delay if possible...
[12:24:19] <t432> duch_kazatel: i guess I have to initialise line 9 but how? http://pastebin.com/pr1D9TLi
[12:24:45] <duch_kazatel> t432 no clude i don't use jquery ui.
[12:24:58] <JLT> like instead of a timeout, add a .delay and check the object for any other elements with mouseover...
[12:25:06] <JLT> got a feeling that's a nasty way of doing it
[12:25:21] <JLT> only thing i can think of at the moment but either way, chaining would still occur and what not.
[12:25:34] <defk0n> jlt i have the weirdest boner right now :(
[12:25:46] <doug65536> JLT: ok. well, you've alienated the only person helping you. good luck
[12:25:49] <JLT> defk0n i'll let my mother know.
[12:26:04] <JLT> I didn't alienate anyone...
[12:26:26] <JLT> I was just trying to figure out a solution based upon duch_kazatel said... seeing as he's refusing to give any more help other than words ;p
[12:26:28] <duch_kazatel> and JLT no.  my solution would be to either let the animation always complete, or to create an interrupt that'd cancel the currently running animation and close it.
[12:27:05] <duch_kazatel> i take issue with you because you basically said "i'm giving up and going to bed - somebody else should do this for me."
[12:28:00] <guideX> duch_kazatel: isn't that how the open source community began?
[12:28:06] <JLT> I have had trouble understanding other peoples "word of advice" before... I just struggle that way. I have to visuaully see examples in order to understand better. I've always been that kind of learner.
[12:28:38] <duch_kazatel> guideX err, what?  with somebody telling somebody else what to do?  no.  it began with people making their own solutions and sharing them, then other people offering to help.
[12:28:41] <JLT> At school, if I was informed to write an essay.. I would fail. I can only write one if I have an example to follow. I'm just a sucker.
[12:29:01] <guideX> duch_kazatel: was more of a joke :)))
[12:29:07] <duch_kazatel> guideX heh hard to tell ;)
[12:29:12] <duch_kazatel> been one of those days.
[12:29:15] <defk0n> you should add something on that orb. if already mouse over, dont repeat animation
[12:30:16] <duch_kazatel> JLT so you're trying to code but can't unless you see an example of how you should write something first?
[12:31:28] <JLT> Unless I knew how to do it off the top of my head, yes in a way. I don't expect it done for me but I guess when it comes to code... an example is pretty much the full thing.
[12:32:08] <JLT> I dunno. Just been more of a visual learner. I learn by watching as opposed to reading a textbook. Some people just are like that.
[12:32:38] <guideX> JLT: I find the online c++ video's very helpful
[12:32:48] <duch_kazatel> sure.  i'm one of them.  but you need to have the foundation as a programmer to understand how to read documentation.
[12:33:37] <doug65536> JLT: I was going to defer the slideups too, but since you have an issue with setTimeout, I'll let you do something more to your liking
[12:34:10] <guideX> what's wrong with settimeout
[12:34:22] <duch_kazatel> i've never liked the idea of waiting on a timer personally.
[12:34:29] <duch_kazatel> wait for an actual event of some sort.
[12:34:37] <guideX> I like set timeout for some things, usually cheap workarounds
[12:34:42] <doug65536> I have years of experience with C++ multithreading. settimeout is a laugh in comparison
[12:34:45] <glosoli> anyone familiar with jquery file upload and IE8 issues doing post ?
[12:35:13] <duch_kazatel> guideX that's when I like to avoid them.
[12:35:25] <guideX> well it depends on the situation right?
[12:35:31] <JLT> It's something I need to take up with an educational specialist. I've always leant towards the fact I have some learning "difficulty" but I don't really know.
[12:35:36] <guideX> sometimes I just want to get it on the screen
[12:35:44] <guideX> in those situations, a settimeout might help
[12:35:48] <JLT> I have nothign against a timeout personally, was just trying to figure out a way without it as duch_kazatel said he wasn't a fan.
[12:35:53] <duch_kazatel> guideX eeeh. i try not to.
[12:36:10] <duch_kazatel> guideX those workarounds always bite me in the ass.
[12:36:26] <defk0n> guideX lol
[12:36:37] <duch_kazatel> like the pageload popstate bug in chrome.  hard setting a timeout to run detection is dirty and can be avoided.
[12:36:39] <defk0n> for everything else, their is matercard
[12:36:45] <guideX> I think I always use it when I want an event to complete before I do something
[12:36:52] <guideX> usually a click event or xsomething
[12:37:00] <duch_kazatel> guideX that's exactly the wrong time to use them, then.
[12:37:05] <duch_kazatel> you should be binding to events.
[12:37:10] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: all you need to do is run replaceState at initialization
[12:37:14] <guideX> yes
[12:37:32] <guideX> as I said before, cheap ugly and painful workaround to get it on the screen 30 seconds quicker :)))
[12:37:33] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: then ignore any onpopstate that have null state
[12:37:46] <duch_kazatel> doug65536 that's one way to do it ;)
[12:38:18] <duch_kazatel> doug65536 but that reinforces my point - a fairly common workaround involves a settimeout on pageload./
[12:38:20] <guideX> for me speed > code quality, usually
[12:38:51] <duch_kazatel> for me, code quality trumps all else.  i don't want to fix bugs down the road.
[12:38:55] <guideX> the project manager doesn't care how quality the code is, just that I meet the deadlines so
[12:39:06] <duch_kazatel> so glad i don't have that problem.
[12:39:32] <guideX> for me i'm always under pressure, the clock is not on my side
[12:40:01] <duch_kazatel> i remember working under tight deadlines all the time.  so glad i don't have to deal with that.
[12:40:10] <doug65536> maintainability, and correctness are the only things that really matter
[12:40:36] <duch_kazatel> hell my current company had an email sent out today to the entire qa/dev team that basically said "we'd rather hold up release by 2 hours then have a bug"
[12:40:43] <doug65536> useful slow programs are way better than fast useless programs
[12:41:02] <guideX> sometimes an image is still an image
[12:41:08] <guideX> regaurdless of how you put it on the screen ;)
[12:41:14] <JLT> Anyway I'm heading off to sleep. doug65536 i'll keep the fiddle open. I'll continue to work on it when I wake up. May have a better idea with a refreshed memory. if any solutions are posted then I'll look at them later, just ping my name.
[12:41:18] <JLT> zzzz
[12:41:47] <duch_kazatel> guideX sure, let me know how that works for ou when the timeout and event aren't syncing up the way you want.
[12:41:49] <duch_kazatel> it
[12:42:04] <duch_kazatel> *it's important to properly bind to events imo
[12:42:05] <guideX> well if the workaround doesn't work, then it's not truely a workaround right?
[12:42:18] <duch_kazatel> ... no shit?
[12:42:33] <duch_kazatel> that statement is like saying "if the blue sky isn't blue, it's not a blue sky".
[12:42:44] <guideX> so if I implement a workaround, that says that this is a working workaroujnd
[12:42:53] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't mean it's a good idea.
[12:43:01] <guideX> nope it's a horrible idea!
[12:43:16] <defk0n> to erect or not to erect, thats the phallic question.
[12:43:36] <Ritzton> if someone want to post a form on another port, I did this dirty thing inside the onsubmit event : $(this).attr('action', 'https://'+window.location.hostname+':3000/path');
[12:43:59] <duch_kazatel> Ritzton dude seriously?
[12:44:02] <guideX> duch_kazatel: if you wake up late, and have to rush to work (as a workaround), but still make it on time, it worked right? but was still a terrible idea
[12:44:21] <guideX> cause you could have crashed, been pulled over, etc
[12:44:33] <Ritzton> duch_kazatel> yeah because nobody here was able to tell me a better solution
[12:44:35] <duch_kazatel> guideX i don't speed personally.
[12:44:45] <duch_kazatel> Ritzton BECAUSE IT'S A SECURITY PROBLEM.
[12:45:08] <duch_kazatel> guideX your entire argument is "hay guize i'm going to push bugged code because at least it gets done!"
[12:45:14] <Ritzton> duch_kazatel> poutine told you to read again the theory
[12:45:22] <guideX> yep, pretty much
[12:45:30] <guideX> on time etc.. which is more important to them
[12:45:31] <duch_kazatel> i feel bad for whoever will maintain your code later.
[12:45:42] <guideX> well I maintain it ultimately
[12:45:49] <duch_kazatel> not when you leave the company.
[12:45:59] <guideX> at that point who cares though?
[12:46:04] <duch_kazatel> ...
[12:46:05] <duch_kazatel> I do.
[12:46:07] <guideX> if I don't work there, I could care less lol
[12:46:12] <duch_kazatel> because it saves everybody else time and money.
[12:46:13] <defk0n> duch_kazatel i kinda agree with guidex. Its better to have a quick prototype.
[12:46:22] <defk0n> and refactor
[12:46:31] <guideX> to the pm, if it's not on time, it doesn't even matter if it's good or bad code
[12:46:44] <duch_kazatel> our team has a completely different perspective.
[12:46:52] <guideX> it's bad code (even if it's good) because it's late (in some situations, late code is 100% unacceptable and worthless)
[12:47:16] <duch_kazatel> that sounds like a really terrible work environment.
[12:47:17] <guideX> sometimes this stuff is to meet event dates which if they pass, the whole thing doesn't matter anyways
[12:47:21] <guideX> yeah it sucks
[12:47:32] <guideX> to a point I can see it, but it's just the way things are here..
[12:47:44] <duch_kazatel> like I said, I've worked at similar places before.  I will never work at a place like that again.
[12:48:09] <guideX> sometimes it's because they tell you things to change last minute, and expect it on time
[12:48:14] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[12:48:20] <duch_kazatel> i am aware of that kind of environment.
[12:48:28] <guideX> at that point, imo, they deserve the crap they are served
[12:48:56] <duch_kazatel> i guess i take pride in my work - if they do that, I tell them "You either get our deliverable late or you don't get the new thing."
[12:49:04] <defk0n> duch_kazatel can you tell why Ritzton code is bad security?
[12:49:28] <duch_kazatel> defk0n cross-domain security.
[12:49:39] <guideX> duch_kazatel: you see, they call this "adgile project management"
[12:49:55] <guideX> in another words, we won't give you enough time to finish, and the deadline won't really make sense
[12:50:03] <duch_kazatel> guideX again, I worked in an "agile" shop.  even we eventually started telling folks "no"
[12:50:13] <duch_kazatel> because it made us look bad as a company when we delivered broken solutions.
[12:50:42] <Less_Seen> yea arbitrary deadlines suck for everyone
[12:50:44] <guideX> these guys don't seem to get that, they spew the usual excuses about how their clients won't listen, but the fact is, the company will never move forward if they never fix that
[12:50:58] <defk0n> duch_kazatel but how is that insecure
[12:51:21] <duch_kazatel> and there's the catch-22.  the client came to YOU for your expertise.  you agreed to everything up front.  they then changed the definition of what needs to be done.
[12:52:58] <duch_kazatel> and defk0n are you getting at a point or are you genuinely curious
[12:52:59] <duch_kazatel> ?
[12:53:00] <guideX> well it's because the client doesn't truely know what they want, and then the pm won't/can't say no
[12:53:08] <defk0n> duch_kazatel im seirous
[12:53:16] <guideX> and this is why adgile doesn't work at all
[12:53:31] <duch_kazatel> guideX actual agile development doesn't have that problem.
[12:53:52] <duch_kazatel> and defk0n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting
[12:54:12] <duch_kazatel> http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/09/cross-site-request-forgeries-and-you.html
[12:56:02] <duch_kazatel> with that, I'm off to lunch.
[12:56:05] <defk0n> duch_kazatel yer but isnt xss about unvalidated userinput
[12:56:17] <defk0n> duch_kazatel you could still validate on a diffrent domain right?
[12:56:35] <sayd> if i have to reload the page with a new hash, how woud i do that? setting location.href to current page + #foo doesnt actually reload the page
[12:56:57] <doug65536> sayd: you could call location.reload()
[12:57:37] <defk0n> sayd window.location
[12:57:57] <doug65536> defk0n: window is the global namespace
[12:58:13] <sayd> window.location is the same but its just a new hash
[12:58:18] <sayd> but i want the page to reload
[12:58:32] <doug65536> sayd: ?
[12:58:40] <defk0n> window.location = "http://www.hostname.org" + hash;
[12:58:49] <doug65536> <doug65536> sayd: you could call location.reload()
[12:58:49] <gnarf> defk0n: episodeNumber is the "index" in the collection
[12:58:52] <sayd> that doesnt reload the page if the host+pathname is the same
[12:59:21] <gnarf> defk0n: jQuery.fn.map(funciton( index, element ) { })
[12:59:22] <sayd>         window.location = loc;
[12:59:24] <sayd>         window.location.reload(true);
[12:59:35] <sayd> that would reload twice i'd think
[12:59:36] <defk0n> gnarf oke, but map returns (value,index) right?
[12:59:41] <sayd> in case its not a hash
[12:59:49] <gnarf> $.map( function( value, index ) {});
[12:59:59] <gnarf> $.fn.map(function( index, value ){})
[13:00:01] <gnarf> ^^^ sadly
[13:00:32] <defk0n> huh
[13:00:52] <gnarf> jQuery.map( thing, function( value, index ) {})
[13:01:02] <duch_kazatel> and more info about CSRF issues: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9169038/what-makes-cross-domain-ajax-insecure
[13:01:03] <gnarf> jQuery.fn.map( function( index, value ) {})
[13:01:23] <gnarf> in other words, a jQuery Collection's "map" method calls with index, value
[13:01:35] <gnarf> but jQuery.map( thing, iterator ) calls with value, index
[13:01:39] <doug65536> sayd: you are assigning the hash to location.hash right?
[13:01:41] <gnarf> its awkward, yes
[13:01:50] <sayd> doug65536: no
[13:02:09] <doug65536> sayd: do that
[13:02:11] <defk0n> gnarf thats just evil. so confusing
[13:02:22] <gnarf> defk0n: i'd prefer if all of the .each / .map were value, index
[13:02:23] <gnarf> but
[13:02:31] <gnarf> can't ever fix it
[13:02:50] <doug65536> sayd: then location.reload() should do what your want
[13:02:57] <gnarf> fixing that would break the internet
[13:03:10] <defk0n> :(
[13:03:37] <gnarf> defk0n: it's always index, value, unless it's $.map
[13:03:39] <doug65536> sayd: include the '#' at the start of what you assign
[13:03:56] <defk0n> k gotcha
[13:05:40] <defk0n> duch_kazatel but i wnna know how $(this).attr('action', 'https://'+window.location.hostname+':3000/path'); is a security vuln in itself.
[13:05:55] <sayd> doug65536: something like this https://gist.github.com/marr/6799724?
[13:07:01] <doug65536> sayd: no, include the # in the value assigned to location.hash
[13:07:32] <defk0n> duch_kazatel its prety much same origin, ip is the same right
[13:07:36] <doug65536> sayd: I wouldn't do that assignment to window.location
[13:07:57] <gnarf> defk0n port is not same origin
[13:08:24] <sayd> doug65536: yeah it doesnt seem to work
[13:08:30] <sayd> just reloads without the hash
[13:11:05] <doug65536> sayd: ah, try location.replace(...full path with hash...)
[13:11:47] <defk0n> https://gist.github.com/marr/6799724 this seems to work btw
[13:12:15] <doug65536> defk0n: on some browsers, assigning to location clobbers the hash
[13:12:23] <doug65536> defk0n: according to MDN
[13:12:30] <modcure> doug65536, thanks.
[13:12:31] <anew> any way i can load a css file async ?
[13:13:07] <gnarf> anew: inject a <link> tag?
[13:13:36] <anew> u mean with append() ?
[13:13:40] <anew> append is not async tho ...
[13:14:09] <gnarf> anew: jaubourg has a hook to add dataType: 'css' to ajax: https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/css.js
[13:14:26] <gnarf> like if you want a callback when it completes loading
[13:15:03] <doug65536> anew: $('head').append($('link').attr('rel', 'stylesheet').attr('src', url));
[13:15:04] <anew> fack that's a lot of work to load a css file
[13:15:12] <anew> doug65536, afaik append is not async
[13:15:22] <doug65536> anew: you're wrong
[13:15:52] <anew> hmm rly, i just read that...
[13:15:54] <doug65536> anew: you think it locks up the browser until it is downloaded? highly doubtful
[13:15:57] <gnarf> loading the content of the <link> tag IS async
[13:16:04] <gnarf> injecting it is sync
[13:16:09] <anew> hmmm
[13:16:39] <gnarf> julian's hook just ensures you can get a callback after the css load
[13:16:51] <gnarf> if you don't need the callback, just inject the link tag
[13:16:52] <doug65536> anew: I would love to see that proven. would be fascinating
[13:17:06] <anew> dunno was just what i was reading
[13:17:12] <anew> wait arent you the google hater from the other day
[13:17:38] <gnarf> it's possible for both of you to be right
[13:17:42] <gnarf> in fact it is true
[13:17:47] <defk0n> gnarf does append return true?
[13:17:58] <gnarf> defk0n append returns "this"
[13:18:07] <gnarf> defk0n chainable
[13:18:12] <jedimind> who hates google?
[13:18:15] <defk0n> hm
[13:18:16] <gnarf> .append().append().find() for instance
[13:18:28] <anew> jedimind lol
[13:18:32] <gnarf> not that i would suggest abusing that ^
[13:18:35] <jedimind> anew <3 so i was right? :)
[13:18:36] <anew> yeah that looks rough
[13:18:46] <defk0n> ^_^
[13:18:48] <anew> oh no, i mean i still think it's async...
[13:18:53] <anew> gnarf kind of agrees
[13:19:02] <anew> doug65536,  thinks it's loaded async with only the <link> tag
[13:19:06] <anew> so i dunno
[13:19:08] <obert> async or twosync?
[13:19:14] <gnarf> anew: append is a sync operation, but adding a <link> tag is an async operation
[13:19:26] <gnarf> like loading the content and having it be applied happens out of thread
[13:19:35] <gnarf> and there is an event called when it completes
[13:19:37] <defk0n> gnarf does this return true?
[13:19:39] <gnarf> (though not everywhere)
[13:19:44] <defk0n> if($(this))?
[13:19:53] <anew> gnarf...
[13:19:56] <gnarf> defk0n: no, all objects are "truthy"
[13:20:00] <doug65536> defk0n: yes, always true
[13:20:06] <anew> if i put the <link> tag, isnt nothing rendered on the page until that link tag is fully read
[13:20:13] <jedimind> anew out of curiosity why are you trying to do it like that to begin with ?
[13:20:18] <gnarf> defk0n !!$() === true
[13:20:49] <jedimind> rather than just loading the css and caching it?
[13:20:59] <jedimind> are you loading/unloading css all the time?
[13:21:02] <defk0n> hm..
[13:21:02] <anew> jedimind i want the page to load along with the css file, not wait for the <link> tag to be read
[13:21:12] <jedimind> the browser does that faster than you could with javascript
[13:21:14] <jedimind> natively
[13:21:19] <anew> yeah that's what i think also
[13:21:22] <anew> if i do it with js
[13:21:28] <doug65536> anew: if you're convinced that it is sync, then get it with ajax, construct a style tag, .text() it, and append it to the body
[13:21:33] <anew> it's goign to take longer than just having the <link> tag
[13:21:37] <jedimind> of course it is
[13:21:43] <jedimind> it loads the link tag way before any js even runs
[13:21:56] <defk0n> yer dom > js
[13:21:58] <gnarf> anew: loading css does not block the browser
[13:22:03] <jedimind> you'll get a FOUC
[13:22:51] <defk0n> also pretty dangerous loading css via js
[13:22:57] <defk0n> what if someone doesnt have js enabled
[13:23:00] <defk0n> no style
[13:23:07] <doug65536> anew: not getting styles in head, synchronously, is a bad idea anyway - the page will show without the styles
[13:24:16] <doug65536> anew: I think waiting a tenth of a second is better than having a totally screwed up page show momentarily
[13:24:17] <gnarf> the initial parse of a page generally waits for it's styles to load
[13:24:18] <gnarf> but if you append one at a later time, it's done async, won't cause blocking
[13:24:21] <doug65536> but that's just me
[13:24:35] <doug65536> us google haters are like that
[13:24:41] <anew> you hater
[13:24:55] <jedimind> DOWN WITH THAT SORT OF THING
[13:25:11] <defk0n> occupy google..
[13:34:42] <n3tw0rm> how do I display content from a mysql db via a jquery on click event
[13:35:09] <n3tw0rm> I have a live search already pulling from the db, now I want be able to click my results and display them on the page without reloading
[13:57:26] <kraytul> will `var newElem = $('elem').replaceWith(data);` cause newElem to point to data?
[13:58:44] <gnarf> kraytul no
[13:59:03] <gnarf> `api replaceWith
[13:59:03] <b-ot> gnarf: .replaceWith(): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[13:59:26] <gnarf> "return the set of elements that was removed" on the api docs
[14:00:24] <kraytul> ah, darn
[14:00:31] <kraytul> removed elements.
[14:00:46] <gnarf> var newElem = $(data).replaceAll('elem')
[14:00:51] <gnarf> `api replaceAll
[14:00:52] <b-ot> gnarf: .replaceAll(): Replace each target element with the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/replaceAll/
[14:01:31] <cereal> so I'm trying to use a class selector with an event and it doesn't seem to like it, but when I do it with an id selector it works, thoughts?  $('.services').on('hide.bs.collapse'), function() { ... });
[14:02:26] <kraytul> thanks gnarf++
[14:03:09] <kraytul> api docs don't elaborate return on it though.
[14:04:06] <gnarf> kraytul in general unless it specifies, it always returns the thing on the left
[14:04:14] <gnarf> other than traversing
[14:04:23] <gnarf> most jQuery methods return the object they were called on
[14:04:24] <kraytul> ok
[14:04:46] <kraytul> sweet
[14:20:38] <dp> I want to animate a tr from it's current height -> 0px tall. however, when I do .animate({ height: 0 }), it only goes down to the height of the text. is there a way around this?
[14:26:42] <aniasis> Hey guys
[14:26:57] <aniasis> I want to use jquery mobile for just page naviagtion
[14:27:10] <aniasis> how can I do this without it hijacking my entire pag
[14:27:11] <aniasis> e
[14:29:30] <aniasis> What what JS should I build?
[14:31:32] <aniasis> Why do I need all these stylesheets for jquery mobile?
[14:32:06] <aniasis> Are they using transform or something?
[14:32:50] <boytoy> aniasis: You can use the structure only CSS if you want to keep things simple
[14:39:58] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/58/ -- why can't I transform div.dropdown into table.dropdown with $(this).replaceWith($('<table class="dropdown">' + this.innerHTML + '</table>'));?
[14:42:33] <boytoy> The table is created outside $(this), while $(this) is removed, so all the innerHTML becomes orphan.
[14:44:34] <ngharo> boytoy: why do you need a table anyways?
[14:45:01] <boytoy> ngharo: Oh it's a long story =)
[14:45:29] <ngharo> so no to styling, or converting your list items into a UL list?
[14:45:33] <boytoy> ngharo: Basically there's no other way to display the dropdown with multiple flexible columns :/
[14:46:06] <boytoy> That's correct
[14:47:02] <boytoy> That's what we all concluded both in here and in #css yesterday :-)
[14:47:04] <ngharo> you could achieve both your examples using <li>'s floated left and some css max-height/width constraints
[14:47:56] <ngharo> boytoy: i can probably help with your problem but it just seems there is a better way
[14:48:00] <boytoy> ngharo: Wrapping the a's in li's shouldn't make a difference. In fact when W3C first made li's, they were intended to be used for typographical lists only, not to represent a collection of things.
[14:48:11] <boytoy> yeah i know what you mean
[14:48:52] <boytoy> believe me there was quite a stir in these two channels about it eyesterday =)
[14:49:46] <boytoy> everybody was like "fuck tables!!".. then 30 min later.. "ok i guess tables are justified here" =)
[14:50:59] <jphase> lol
[14:51:58] <jphase> well this whole "fuck tables" thing is really silly btw. Tables USED to be used for layout purposes, which is where "fuck tables" came from and now everyone hates them by default. They're used for display columnized data in even columns.
[14:52:50] <boytoy> yeah it's not fair
[14:55:11] <boytoy> we gotta do what we can to restore its good name and rep
[14:55:17] <boytoy> starting with this dropdown =)
[14:55:53] <ngharo> boytoy: the number of dropdown items are dynamic?
[14:56:04] <boytoy> nhulea: yep
[14:56:12] <boytoy> oops ngharo :D
[15:04:02] <boytoy> ngharo: its cool, instead of replacing div.dropdown with table.dropdown i think ill just wrap div.dropdown in table.dropdown and then remove div.dropdown
[15:04:27] <boytoy> probably safer that way too
[15:13:33] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/JqZy7/69/ ugglyy
[15:13:36] <ngharo> boytoy: ^
[15:14:22] <boytoy> ngharo: whoa :))
[15:14:41] <boytoy> has its charm i guess
[15:15:56] <boytoy> ngharo: thanks im sure i can use some of that :)
[15:16:38] <ngharo> updated /70/ to use css lineheight to remove a hardcoded value
[15:18:09] <joker_89> hi i dont underestand why this don't work: var err = verify_password(document.form.password1.value, document.form.password2.value); $('#error').html(err);
[15:18:40] <ngharo> what does verify_password return?
[15:18:53] <joker_89> says: TypeError: Argument 1 of Node.appendChild is not an object.
[15:19:02] <joker_89> return a string that is coded in php
[15:19:23] <joker_89> like that: err[err.length] = "<?=$lang['REQUIRED_FIELDS']?>";
[15:20:03] <ngharo> put a console.log(err); before you write it via .html() and make sure
[15:20:35] <joker_89> i put alert(err)
[15:20:38] <joker_89> and works ok
[15:20:59] <ngharo> alert is yucky, try console.log next time just fyi
[15:21:03] <joker_89> ok
[15:21:14] <ngharo> what you pasted above, it looks like err is an array
[15:21:20] <joker_89> this function only works with text that is from json llike msg.txt
[15:21:31] <joker_89> ouch yes.. is an array..
[15:21:52] <ngharo> try .html(err.join('<br/>'));
[15:23:05] <joker_89> now works, i put .toString()
[15:23:07] <joker_89> thnks!
[15:28:44] <boytoy> ngharo: unfortunately in yours all columns are fixed size, so one might as well use css columns. this is why we went for tables so each column doesnt have to use more space than necessary.
[15:30:10] <boytoy> i managed to replace $(this).replaceWith($('<table class="dropdown">' + this.innerHTML + '</table>')); with $(this).wrap('<table class="dropdown" />'); and $(this).children().unwrap(); though so we are on the right path hopefully: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/78/
[15:30:58] <ngharo> oh sorry, i thought that was the intent looking at the examples
[15:31:41] <ztylr> hey guys
[15:31:48] <ngharo> is it valid to have a table without <tr> ?
[15:31:56] <ztylr> i need some assistance with jQplot DateAxisRenderer
[15:32:45] <boytoy> ngharo: yeah i shouldnt have put "Amet amet amet" (translated: love love love) in all columns.. my bad
[15:32:56] <boytoy> ngharo: probably not, was gonna add the tr's later once i know how many we need
[15:33:34] <boytoy> ngharo: but $(this).replaceWith('<table class="dropdown">' + this.innerHTML + '</table>'); without the extra $() seemed to work though
[15:33:50] <ztylr> specifically the xaxis labels
[15:37:16] <ngharo> boytoy: what is visible() do? can that be a simple "if items greater than X" instead?
[15:38:45] <ngharo> oh nm, read looked at the plugin
[15:39:10] <ngharo> go go grammar
[15:41:14] <boytoy> ngharo: hehe
[15:41:52] <boytoy> ngharo: currently doing it like this http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/82/ since i need the visible page dimensions to properly size the dropdowns later on, but so far var page = $("body").visible(); is failing
[15:50:11] <ngharo> boytoy: I was hoping this would work: http://jsfiddle.net/JqZy7/84/ but $td.visible() always returns true even though it's way off to the right
[15:51:15] <boytoy> ngharo: nice !!
[15:51:27] <boytoy> ngharo: i see you ran jsfiddle's TidyUp over the html.. lulz
[15:51:54] <boytoy> (the owner is working on a fix though)
[15:52:02] <ngharo> haha, yeah that sucks
[15:52:17] <ngharo> i just hate the indenting in the javascript view
[15:52:31] <boytoy> ooh yeah
[15:52:38] <ngharo> wish i could easily get fiddles in and out of my editor
[15:52:41] <ngharo> that would be baller
[15:52:42] <boytoy> i requested a way to disable autoindenting as well.. its coming soon
[15:53:07] <boytoy> but yeah.. i see you're a few steps ahead of me in this fiddle..
[15:54:08] <ngharo> i think if $td.visible() would work it would be just dandy
[15:54:31] <boytoy> ngharo: that would be balling indeed.. you can always join #jsfiddle and ask zalun for new features
[15:54:38] <ngharo> i tried .offset().left > currentviewportX but display: none elements don't have position data
[15:54:54] <boytoy> hmm
[16:00:40] <JosephFerano> hello peoples, i'm using $("input[name='my-checkbox-group']") as a way for getting a group of checkboxes, is there a way that I can refine my search based on the value as well?
[16:01:04] <JosephFerano> like could I do $("input[name='flange-cboxes';value='None']")
[16:01:22] <JosephFerano> would something like that work or would I have to do an each() and then compare the value?
[16:01:55] <ngharo> boytoy: it kind of works when drop down is showing upon execution: http://jsfiddle.net/JqZy7/85/
[16:01:57] <JosephFerano> not sure what the syntax would be
[16:02:47] <ngharo> except now the condition visible() reports false for the first div..
[16:04:37] <JosephFerano> never mind, found it
[16:04:38] <JosephFerano> http://api.jquery.com/multiple-attribute-selector/
[16:05:59] <boytoy> ngharo: good god
[16:07:11] <boytoy> ngharo: here with no fixed width on .list_item: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/87/ :D
[16:08:34] <boytoy> ngharo: it should be as high as possible though.. http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/87/embedded/result/
[16:09:03] <boytoy> ngharo: whats the purpose of var $this = $(this)?
[16:10:32] <ngharo> old habits, i'm sure jquery recognizes this and handles it effeciently
[16:10:53] <ngharo> cache all the selectors!
[16:10:59] <boytoy> oh ok =)
[16:11:12] <boytoy> yeah :)
[16:17:36] <ngharo> still got that issue with tables where items end in middle of rows, instead of filling all columns and leaving the empties at the end
[16:20:33] <boytoy> ngharo: another issue would be that items should go chronologically downwards and not sidewards.. my bad i forgot to mention
[16:20:55] <boytoy> (would make it easier for the user to read through i think)
[16:21:37] <ngharo> yeah, this is where you need to ditch tables
[16:21:57] <ngharo> err, welp actually floating wouldn't fix that either
[16:22:20] <ngharo> but wrapping lists into containing floating divs would
[16:22:25] <doug65536> ngharo: jquery doesn't handle 'this' particularly efficiently. the cost of building a new selector is not insignificant either. you should cache your selectors
[16:22:58] <ngharo> i knew i shouldn't give up that habit of caching $(this) ;)
[16:23:21] <boytoy> :)
[16:23:38] <boytoy> but yeah.. ditch tables then?
[16:29:39] <ngharo> mayhaps
[16:29:41] <ngharo> playing around
[16:31:52] <boytoy> same

[16:52:43] <ilteris> hey guys, do you know why my scroller shows up like a list first and then go into scroll mode here? http://tekkonpetrochemical.com/ is there a way to hide the first list of elements?
[16:53:09] <boltR> is there a way to attach stuff to an event object before it gets passed up?
[16:53:12] <boltR> http://jsfiddle.net/exSKF/1/
[16:53:26] <boltR> i want to attach a value at the button level and pass it up to the body
[16:55:50] <boytoy> ngharo: oh definitely.. damn, no tables !! :D
[16:56:46] <ngharo> boytoy: i think /4/ is the best i can do
[16:57:30] <boytoy> ngharo: extraordinary piece of human engineering
[16:57:48] <boytoy> whats really left though, it looks complete
[16:57:49] * ngharo beeps like a robot
[16:58:04] <boytoy> :)
[16:58:05] <ngharo> some accounting for padding or something, the last items on the bottom get chopped
[16:58:40] <ngharo> boytoy: the event stop bubbling once it's handled
[16:59:00] <ngharo> boytoy: perhaps you can just define a method to call instead of relying on that event from bubbling up
[16:59:10] <ngharo> oops
[16:59:12] <ngharo> boltR: ^^
[16:59:55] <boltR> ngharo: so it's actually 2 different events happening?
[17:00:06] <boltR> the one body is getting vs the one for the button
[17:00:13] <boytoy> ngharo: well really thanks a lot man, this is dimensions apart from what i had in mind
[17:00:35] <boltR> actually not it's not
[17:00:37] <boltR> no*
[17:00:40] <boytoy> ngharo: like ive told many of the others in here if you ever need design services (adding some extra value to your app or concept) give me a hollar..
[17:00:54] <boltR> if i call e.stopPropagation() the 2nd alert doesn't show up
[17:01:48] <boltR> ngharo: http://jsfiddle.net/ekWpX/ vs : http://jsfiddle.net/exSKF/1/
[17:03:36] <ngharo> oops, you're right hmm
[17:06:08] <boytoy> ngharo: i reckon all dropdowns should be set to visibility hidden instead of display none?
[17:06:42] <boytoy> i think ive encountered a similar case where jquery couldnt do any calculations because the element was display none
[17:07:03] <ngharo> that or just hide() it after that bit is complete
[17:08:02] <boytoy> great!
[17:08:20] <insel> is there a shorter way to access child.elements or have i to build lists of .children('').children('').children('').children('').... ?
[17:09:14] <ngharo> insel: find() ?
[17:09:42] <insel> will find "walk down" the child levels?
[17:10:06] <ngharo> yes until it finds what you're looking for via selector
[17:10:27] <insel> ngharo: great ty
[17:11:24] <ngharo> boltR: there some hacks listed here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7117935/modify-event-data-during-propagation
[17:11:45] <ngharo> but surely there is a better way to do what you're trying to accomplish
[17:12:05] <boltR> hmm
[17:12:09] <boltR> e.originalEvent
[17:12:13] <boltR> might be what i'm looking for
[17:12:15] <boltR> thanks ngharo
[17:12:20] <boltR> i'll look through these
[17:13:47] <boltR> ngharo: ya originalevent worked
[17:13:49] <boltR> thanks so much
[17:13:52] <cnap> hello people, I have a quick question
[17:14:24] <cnap> so I am using jquery to dynamically append <option> tags to a dropdown list
[17:14:35] <cnap> then later on I need to know what value the user has selected
[17:14:43] <cnap> actually when an event happens - button click
[17:15:14] <cnap> One solution I thought is that I could bind a function to an change event and when the user picks a value from the list, I can updated a hidden html tag
[17:15:19] <boytoy> ngharo: sweet lord almighty: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WzWHL/8/show/
[17:15:27] <cnap> then later on I can read this... but I am not sure if this is good practise
[17:15:59] <boytoy> this is beyond perfect man.. thank you so much..
[17:16:05] <ngharo> cnap: just query for the <select> element, then call .val() on it to get the current value selected
[17:16:13] <boytoy> jphase: check it out no tables: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WzWHL/8/show/ =)
[17:16:21] <ngharo> yay

[17:17:10] <boytoy> for real
[17:17:22] <jphase> haha, yeah nice
[17:17:38] <jphase> you did a vertical container instead of a horizontal one, good approach
[17:17:39] <boytoy> now we can finally rest at the top of the mountain

[17:46:52] <Baluse> docs say that empty does unbind

[18:19:21] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/St4KH/ <— hi guys its kind of tricky to me how to access the second .this_parent .test out from found label. Anyone can help please.
[18:22:41] <duch_away> axscode wat.  are you trying to match the group that has a label that contains the word "magic"?
[18:23:41] <axscode> out from the element that contains 'Magic'  i need to find its sibling .test
[18:23:55] <duch_away> your code doesn't work anyway.
[18:23:56] <axscode> only if label has 'Magic' on it
[18:24:00] <axscode> aw
[18:24:04] <duch_away> "$(label).each(function(){" isn't valid.
[18:24:05] <duch_away> sec.
[18:24:56] <pixelpimp> axscode: look in the console.  you have some errors.
[18:25:54] <pixelpimp> you'll also need to use .text(), because right now you're checking on the jquery object itself
[18:26:06] <ngharo> axscode: something like http://jsfiddle.net/St4KH/4/
[18:26:11] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/St4KH/5/
[18:26:28] <pixelpimp> much better
[18:26:35] <axscode> grrr.. next..
[18:26:48] <axscode> wait another sample comming
[18:27:30] <pixelpimp> `api siblings @ axscode
[18:27:30] <b-ot> axscode: .siblings(): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/

[18:28:32] <duch_away> b-ot isn't a person btw.
[18:28:40] <axscode> aw demmit
[18:28:48] <duch_away> http://jsfiddle.net/St4KH/8/
[18:28:54] <duch_away> seems to work for me
[18:29:45] <axscode> ahhhhh
[18:29:53] <axscode> hmm ill try it
[18:30:52] <axscode> http://pastebin.com/k4xAMvj4 <— grr i think im doing that already
[18:32:06] <duch_away> i'd need to see your html.
[18:32:35] <axscode> 	hhmmm one more
[18:32:55] <duch_away> and please do it in a fiddle.
[18:33:58] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/St4KH/9/
[18:35:16] <duch_away> there's your problem - $(this) on line 6 is pointing to the label.
[18:35:22] <duch_away> that's the current context.
[18:36:04] <axscode> right,
[18:36:08] <ngharo> maybe you should traverse up to the parent, then back down to .test
[18:36:22] <ngharo> seems more efficient than .siblings().find('.test'); to fix your latest fiddle
[18:36:41] <axscode> can you show me a bit
[18:36:54] <axscode> i did .parent() earler, but i dont know how to travers if i have the parent
[18:36:59] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/St4KH/10/
[18:37:02] <axscode> .each() ?
[18:37:16] <axscode> ah .find()
[18:37:33] <axscode> ill try it out
[18:38:07] <axscode> you saved me..
[18:38:09] <duch_kazatel> axscode is this for something that needs to perform well?
[18:38:27] <axscode> duch what you mean.?
[18:38:37] <jeffszusz> hey guys; I need to run an animation while a condition is met, rather than on an event. is that possible?
[18:38:47] <duch_kazatel> nevermind, don't worry about it.
[18:38:52] <ngharo> :p
[18:39:04] <ngharo> jeffszusz: sure just call it when the condition is met
[18:39:07] <duch_kazatel> jeffszusz nope - you can't "watch" a variable.  you need an event.
[18:39:14] <duch_kazatel> ^^ what ngharo said.
[18:39:23] <jeffszusz> well
[18:39:26] <axscode> duch: its a long list of radio buttons, yeah performing well and fast is what i need also.
[18:39:34] <jeffszusz> I need to do .stop() when that condition -stops- being met
[18:40:02] <ngharo> axscode: could you just tag the parent div with a class?
[18:40:30] <duch_kazatel> jeffszusz you can't do that - why not call .stop() in the thing you'd use to set a variable?
[18:40:33] <JimmyXander> Does anyone know why this doesn't work? var htmlfrag = $.get('img/projects/' + setname + '/content.html');
[18:40:42] <ngharo> then you dont need any javacsript, just some css like: div.magicParent div.test { // round style }
[18:40:47] <axscode> ngharo what you mean, i need to add a new class name? the html is pregenerated
[18:40:59] <jeffszusz> I guess I'll be more specific. take a look at this gist. https://gist.github.com/jeffszusz/79cce47ba44574dd0cc7
[18:41:29] <jeffszusz> I need to modify that so that instead of on mousedown and mouseup, they happen when mouse is down and e.pageX is 0, and when mouse goes up OR e.pageX is > 0
[18:41:59] <duch_kazatel> then add more conditionals?
[18:42:16] <JimmyXander> How do I load an html document into a variable?
[18:42:40] <ngharo> JimmyXander: read the docs, $.get doesn't return like that
[18:42:54] <JimmyXander> I have some trouble understanding the docs
[18:42:54] <ngharo> or google some ajax 101
[18:43:09] <duch_kazatel> JimmyXander you have to craft a full request.  it's pretty simple in jquery.
[18:44:25] <JimmyXander> I don't know what that means
[18:45:04] <JimmyXander> Could you point me in the right direction?
[18:45:13] <JimmyXander> I'll try me best to figure it out
[18:45:15] <ngharo> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[18:45:49] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[18:46:55] <ngharo> JimmyXander: i think what you have will work, you just need to use a callback
[18:46:58] <ngharo> look at the examples
[18:47:15] <JimmyXander> What is a callback?
[18:47:18] <JimmyXander> I'm pretty new to this
[18:47:37] <JimmyXander> I'm just trying to load a paragraph when something is clicked on
[18:48:13] <duch_kazatel> why are you using ajax for that?
[18:49:10] <ngharo> JimmyXander: read the key concepts on the page I linked you to
[18:49:21] <ngharo> it'll talks about callbacks
[18:49:32] <JimmyXander> because there are a lot of them and they need to be changed frequently, so I figured it would be better for my friend if they were separate documents that she could edit.
[18:49:41] <JimmyXander> instead of having to go into the code base
[18:49:44] <ngharo> "The asynchronicity of Ajax catches many new jQuery users off guard. Because Ajax calls are asynchronous by default, the response is not immediately available. Responses can only be handled using a callback."
[18:49:50] <JimmyXander> every time she wanted to make a change
[18:49:59] <duch_kazatel> then you'll need to learn about ajax.
[18:50:09] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty simple once you get the hang of it.
[18:51:06] <duch_kazatel> and "callbacks" are simple - when a function does something (like completes), you can then have it "call back" to another function.
[18:51:30] <jned> what's the best way to style an input form.  I saw one where you use a label and one tried one where you submit it programmically, but my file isn't getting sent to server
[18:53:31] <JimmyXander> did this instead
[18:53:32] <JimmyXander> $(setarticle).load('img/projects/' + setname + '/content.html',function(){

[18:54:00] <JimmyXander> I'm using a for loop to generate "fragment" which is a set of images to go along with the content

[18:54:28] <JimmyXander> yay
[19:08:09] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/St4KH/11/ <— hi guys another tricky one, how is it possible to check mouseenter from the :after added element?
[19:20:51] <tehopeologist> hey all
[19:21:11] <tehopeologist> are there certain parameters for the print() function?
[19:21:37] <tehopeologist> for instance, i want to write a function that, after something's been printed OR cancelled, i want to run some jquery
[19:21:47] <tehopeologist> is that possible to detect from the browser somehow?
[19:24:15] <tehopeologist> anyone there?
[19:32:04] <boytoy> ngharo: any idea why #vertical_menu stops working if it's position: fixed;?
[19:32:22] <boytoy> ngharo: gotta run this menu inside this fixed position header so
[19:34:37] <boytoy> (http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/docs/toolbars/bars-fullscreen.html)
[19:40:04] <OHNERO> Hey quick question everyone, I wasn't sure where to ask this so if I am in the wrong place let me know. What is the best way to make an <a> tag link back? Currently I just used <a href="../"></a> which is working fine but I wasn't sure if that is okay?
[19:50:30] <raj> if I'm writing a jq script that needs css, how do I get the css to be added?
[19:53:43] <boytoy> raj: you mean like addClass() or css()?
[19:53:54] <Ububegin> How do I pass both Form and Json data from client to controller.. I know how to do this independently .. but together is how ?? Here is the pastebin, ideone.com/1dQwee
[19:57:20] <raj> css
[20:21:38] <ngharo> Ububegin: you'll probably have to build up your data object by hand
[20:24:28] <Ububegin> ngharo: hmm, ok..
[20:24:52] <Ububegin> Btw, is it a good practise to put all of the jquery/javascript code inside the document.ready() method ?
[20:25:38] <ngharo> yes
[20:31:48] <jphase> unless you want to do .load or .scroll on the window or something for example :x
[20:33:16] <Ububegin> I can get an element by $('#id') ... how do i get the name of this element... $('#id').name -->doesnt work
[20:33:34] <Phlow> .attr('name')
[20:34:15] <Ububegin> Phlow: thnks. :)
[20:36:49] <jphase> Ububegin:  actually, .prop('name');
[20:36:52] <jphase> .attr is deprecated
[20:37:22] <Ububegin> jphase: ah..:)
[20:37:57] <jphase> they both work but for now, but thinking forward, one day that will be broken if jQuery is updated
[20:38:17] * jphase still types .attr ... hard habit to break
[20:39:13] <Ububegin> another qn, data = {"name":someValue} -->OK But data = { $('#id').prop('name'):someValue} --> Unexpected String error
[20:40:00] <ngharo> prop !== attr
[20:40:35] <Ububegin> ngharo: anyways,  But data = { $('#id').attr('name'):someValue} --> Unexpected String error also
[20:40:54] <Phlow> Ububegin, data[$('#id').prop('name')] = someValue;
[20:41:40] <Phlow> Some people incorrectly put name's on elements that shouldn't have names, not sure prop can handle that correctly
[20:47:09] <jphase> oh for some reason I though attr was deprecated
[20:47:22] <jphase> that's just the live on paradigm
[20:48:00] <jphase> isn't prop okay to use on any thing attr can get though since prop handles multiple data types?
[20:58:06] <boytoy> ngharo: my bad the bug was elsewhre :P
[20:58:22] <ngharo> :]
[21:00:29] <buzzybron> i'm trying to write a jq plugin, and how do i expose a public function within the plugin?
[21:09:46] <buzzybron> i'm trying to write a jq plugin, and how do i expose a public function within the plugin?
[21:35:17] <JLT>  /join #piercing
[21:35:19] <JLT> oops
[22:09:01] <thomedy> okay i have a jsfiddle can someone tell me why my $_POST  var has the value as an array but not all of the looped indexes
[22:09:39] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/KA8kx/1/
[22:11:22] <Ububegin> Phlow: hi, data[$('#id').prop('name')] = someValue; doesnt work... :|
[22:14:03] <Phlow> hmm
[22:15:50] <Ububegin> var sendData;sendData[$('#id').prop('name')] = someValue and JSON.stringify(sendData) .... at Controller, JsonNode json = request().body().asJson() .. the json Object returned is null...
[22:16:42] <Ububegin> Phlow: however, it works if I do sendData = {"name":someValue}
[22:20:04] <JLT> http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/9/ I tried to simplify what I have. Ok so if you hover over the orb, it'll open 3 things. Pay attention to the 2 big bars that open up. When you hover over one, the other closes - this is perfect. When you hover back on the orb to open up the other bar as it has closed, the one you were just on closes and then reopens. What methods could I take to prevent that?
[22:20:32] <Phlow> Ububegin, ah, var sendData = {}; first
[22:23:16] <Ububegin> Phlow: thanks... :D
[22:24:39] <JLT> Could anyone give me some help/advice? :)
[22:24:49] <JLT> Been working at this for 12 hours, failing miserably.
[22:26:36] <Phlow> JLT, http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/11/
[22:27:15] <Phlow> err, missing e from the vertical one
[22:27:55] <Phlow> http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/12/
[22:29:36] <JLT> nice. My next idea would be if you are not on any of the menus (including the coins/level bar and the orb), it should all close.
[22:30:02] <JLT> and then preventing chaining if you keep entering your mouse over the orb. It's one of the biggest issues I faced.
[22:30:24] <JLT> I wasn't asking anyone to do it for me (I got raged at last night for that) but yeah.
[22:30:43] <Phlow> you should be able to figure out the next part
[22:31:25] <JLT> ill give it a try ;p
[22:35:20] <JLT> There are errors like: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLHtmlElement> has no method 'prop'
[22:35:43] <JLT> Not sure if they are there with your version but either way mine doesn't work. http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/13/ tried to make it so like..
[22:36:00] <JLT> if you move your mouse away from an element, AND if your mouse isn't over another element... to close... but ti doesn't close.
[22:36:37] <JLT> Was I even close? XD
[22:46:17] <thomedy> hello...
[22:46:23] <thomedy> did anyone see my jsfiddle
[22:47:21] <JLT> link?
[22:48:08] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/KA8kx/2/
[22:48:18] <thomedy> im just trying to add an array in my elements.
[22:48:23] <thomedy> and it worked once
[22:48:26] <Phlow> JLT, http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/16/
[22:49:02] <Phlow> JLT, always check console for js errors... it was telling you prop wasn't valid on relatedTarget.
[22:49:29] <Guest48238> can anyone test if this is a bug?
[22:49:31] <Guest48238> $('<td onclick=demoFunc(\"Some String = test\")>Test</td>')
[22:49:48] <Guest48238> [ <td onclick=​"demoFunc("Some" string=​"test")​">​Test​</td>​ ]
[22:50:02] <Guest48238> when it's created, there are extra double quotes inside the onclick
[22:50:55] <JLT> Phlow nice.. however hovering back and forth on the orb will cause a chain. I also noticed.. if you quickly hover from a menu to around where the OM is on the logo, it'll close and reopen that menu again.
[22:51:21] <JLT> ah yes... but errors still ;p heh
[22:52:20] <JLT> wait what did you actually change?
[22:52:47] <Phlow> wrapped e.relatedTarget in a jquery object and used that
[22:52:49] <jtm> Guest48238 Why would you use onclick with inline JS like that?
[22:53:32] <Guest48238> there's a v big chain to create a table, if i'd to do it using document.createElement it's quite a hassle
[22:53:57] <Guest48238> anyway
[22:54:07] <Guest48238> $('<td onclick=demoFunc(\"SomeString = test\")>Test</td>') <-- this is fine
[22:54:13] <Guest48238> $('<td onclick=demoFunc(\"Some String = test\")>Test</td>') <-- this is not
[22:54:26] <Guest48238> the space somehow messes up jquery's element creation
[22:54:36] <Phlow> might be a parser bug
[22:54:36] <JLT> Phlow simple change... can you explain how that fixed it?
[22:54:47] <Guest48238> i tried escaping quotes etc
[22:54:56] <Phlow> JLT, e.relatedTarget was an element, not a jquery object, so .prop() didn't exist on it
[22:57:23] <Phlow> Guest48238, what about  $('<td onclick=demoFunc("Some String = test")>Test</td>')
[22:57:34] <Phlow> and  $('<td onclick=demoFunc(\'Some String = test\')>Test</td>')
[22:57:57] <JLT> but howcome it worked down on line 25 and 33 Phlow?
[22:58:22] <Guest48238> Phlow: it still render as [ <td onclick=​"demoFunc("Some" string=​"test")​">​Test​</td>​ ]
[22:58:35] <Guest48238> i'm using dev tools to try
[22:58:44] <thomedy> please help.. i have an form_append and it adds an input with name="token[]" name=thing
[22:58:49] <Phlow> JLT, that's a good question, I don't actually know
[22:58:52] <thomedy> and it loops and appends every time
[22:59:02] <thomedy> it seems to show up in my html
[22:59:12] <thomedy> but in my POST it seems to only give me one
[22:59:24] <thomedy> please help because im not sure why
[23:00:05] <JLT> it'll be an array of fields in the POST, thomedy
[23:00:34] <thomedy> but its not that s the thing
[23:00:36] <Phlow> Guest48238, what version of jquery?
[23:01:06] <thomedy> it is an array and it loops i can disable the submit and see it builds all of the loooped elements
[23:01:11] <Guest48238> Phlow: 1.10.2
[23:01:11] <JLT> Are you using PHP thomedy? print_r($_POST); if not then I'm not sure how I could help you.
[23:01:13] <thomedy> bu tthen in post on my serversisde its not there
[23:01:15] <thomedy>  yes php
[23:01:24] <thomedy> so the js looks right ?
[23:01:43] <JLT> Phlow okay with that out the way.. howcome if you quickly hover from a menu over to "OM" it'll close and reopen it? What is there to ... stop it.
[23:02:08] <JLT> I shall be back in about 30-45 minutes Phlow, taking dog for a walk. Ping me and I'll read all messages when I come back
[23:02:54] <Phlow> I'm actually going to sleep now
[23:02:59] <Phlow> someone else can help
[23:29:39] <cadz> hi anyone here?
[23:31:30] <nisseni> yes
[23:31:41] <cadz> nisseni: please help me
[23:31:58] <nisseni> state your issue and someone might help you ;)
[23:33:04] <cadz> nisseni: if i have declared a Js variable and i passed this variuable inside an ajax which is inside another ajax then modified it there, concatinated something to it, is it still accessible outside the ajax? cause i tried printing the variable outside, it prints nothing
[23:33:06] <sunson> I have a table with rows each having an 'id' attribute. But doing $("#rowid") does not return any elements. Why?
[23:33:40] <cadz> sunson: did you make the id unique?
[23:34:04] <nisseni> cadz: any code to look at?
[23:34:14] <cadz> nisseni: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19151220/cant-concatinate-a-javascript-variable-inside-an-ajax-which-is-inside-another-aj?noredirect=1#comment28328714_19151220
[23:34:24] <cadz> that's my stackoverflow question
[23:35:54] <cadz> nisseni: ill wait for your idea ok?
[23:36:14] <nisseni> cadz: actually, never tried doing like that
[23:36:23] <nisseni> but I don't see why it wouldn't work
[23:36:36] <nisseni> but you're not passing the data variable ?
[23:36:46] <sunson> cadz, yes. is ":" allowed in the id attribute?
[23:37:15] <cadz> nisseni: no, what i need to display is just plain html, generated through closure template
[23:37:52] <nisseni> cadz: I see, so no returning data?
[23:38:37] <cadz> nisseni: no, just set the variable to a new concat value, and print it outside of the loop
[23:38:43] <nisseni> cadz: have you tried displaying the html in the end of the "first" success ?
[23:39:15] <cadz> nisseni: yes, i even tried putting the dialog box inside the loop, it succesfully displays hte data
[23:39:48] <cadz> nisseni: but it will create many dialog boxes, which is not what i intend to do
[23:40:58] <vladikoff> ?ajax101 @ cadz
[23:40:59] <b-ot> cadz: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpg and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[23:41:17] <nisseni> cadz: the htmlvalue variable is adding up from each loop?
[23:42:45] <cadz> nisseni: yes sir
[23:43:09] <cadz> vladikoff: please elaborate sir, or tell me what seems to be the problem, im kind of new to jquery
[23:43:21] <vladikoff> cadz, do you know how AJAX works
[23:43:39] <cadz> vladikoff: im new so maybe a little
[23:43:55] <cadz> vladikoff: can you explain my problem sir? what is causing it?
[23:45:24] <vladikoff> cadz, http://fixingthesejquery.com/images/ajax101.png
[23:45:54] <vladikoff> cadz, you request the data , it is an asynchronous call
[23:46:54] <cadz> vladikoff: in my case, i am not interested in the data of the ajax, just inside ajax, i do some javascript concatenation which did not depend on the data of the ajax
[23:47:24] <vladikoff> cadz, $(".tech-file-upload-dialog").html( htmlvalues ); gets called RIGHT AWAY, it doesn't wait for " htmlvalues += 'some html values to concatinate';"
[23:47:40] <vladikoff> cadz, so your htmlvalues is blank
[23:47:51] <vladikoff> cadz, put $(".tech-file-upload-dialog").html( htmlvalues ); inside of the SUCCESS
[23:48:00] <cadz> vladikoff: it is outside the loop, the whole ajax whithin an ajax is inside the loop
[23:48:23] <cadz> i looped the ajax, then outside the loop there it is the dialog box
[23:48:44] <vladikoff> cadz, can you put $(".tech-file-upload-dialog").html( htmlvalues ); inside of the success?
[23:48:49] <vladikoff> cadz, just to see what happens,
[23:49:00] <cadz> vladikoff: ok
[23:49:59] <cadz> vladikoff: still it doesnt work
[23:52:31] <JLT> Hello guys. I was getting some help with a piece of jquery I was doing earlier. http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/16/ hovering over the orb will open the menus... for instance lets say you hover over the right menu, the btotom will close... the idea is that the menu you are hovered on already, if you go back onto the orb ... it will remain open. This works 50/50, sometimes for instance quickly moving your mouse onto the OM or first P, will cause the me
[23:52:40] <JLT> Should be able to fix it myself if I knew why that was occuring
[23:53:24] <JLT> got it actually... it's because there are other elements.
[23:53:34] <JLT> children elements of orb-container, what would be the simplest way to do that?
[23:54:02] <JLT> if (e.relatedTarget.prop('id') != 'orb-container' or children of 'orb-container') ... not sure the correct code.
[23:54:13] <cadz> vladikoff: any other ideas sir?
[23:58:03] <JLT> What would be the correct logic for the if statement above
[23:58:03] <JLT> ?
