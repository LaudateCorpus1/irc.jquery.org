[01:19:10] <papysmrf> hey all, The PCI counsel's standards no longer include SSL (protocol) and things are moving more to TLS. With regard to Heroku, their documentation refers to SSL (HTTPS) still and I'm wondering if they are actually using TLS? Do I need to set the SSLContext and mess with the version?

[03:34:26] <belea> hi, if i have a table with only html data, no json/ajax ... i've got filters/pagination on it, could there be any possible way of seeing the data as list/grid ?
[03:37:59] <zpzpzpzpzpz> is there equivalenet method to this in jquery? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/Attribute/context
[03:38:18] <zpzpzpzpzpz> hmm
[03:38:47] <zpzpzpzpzpz> belea:  you can do a button and when user click those button uyou can hide your table and make grid appear intead.
[03:39:24] <belea> hmmm, while keeping the filter and pagination? :-?
[03:39:35] <zpzpzpzpzpz> let me check smt
[03:39:36] <belea> that's a good idea
[03:39:41] <zpzpzpzpzpz> i can advice you a plugin may be

[03:40:53] <belea> i was trying to use swift filter, but there's no pagination and list/grid view :-< the idea is to only use html
[03:40:55] <belea> thanks
[03:40:58] <zpzpzpzpzpz> there is also tons of handy things here
[03:41:30] <zpzpzpzpzpz> they have pagination, sorting

[04:20:12] <surianup> Please upload a short jQuery plugin, that can be called like this -
[04:20:12] <surianup> $(selector).jAnalytics(event_type, options);
[04:20:12] <surianup> so that on event_type (e.g. 'click') on the selector it logs to the console options.label, if exists, or the element's data-label attribute, if exists.

[04:47:08] <timkofu> Hi
[04:48:43] <timkofu> I lifted this off of SF and it works https://jsfiddle.net/u41ej2pm/, but why are the two addClass()s needed? It seems just one should do the job?
[05:39:47] <Jeroen__> I've got an $(element) where I'm working with. Now I want to remove all divs with the class ".loading" within this element. Anyone got a clue how to do this?
[05:41:46] <Xatenev> Jeroen__: $(element).find('.loading').remove();
[05:48:45] <dziegler> Jeroen__: https://jsfiddle.net/wx8w2u1L/2/
[05:48:55] <Jeroen__> Thanks both :)
[05:50:20] <Jeroen__> One more question, what about a div that's not inside the $(element) but two divs higher? So for example: <div><div class="loading"><div><div element></div></div></div>
[05:50:40] <Jeroen__> It's always this template, but I need the loading 2 higher then the element.
[05:56:22] <dziegler> Jeroen__: is updatet the fiddle for you: https://jsfiddle.net/wx8w2u1L/3/
[05:57:32] <Jeroen__> Ah thansk
[05:57:39] <Jeroen__> $(element).parent().parent() :)
[05:57:45] <Jeroen__> That's great.
[06:00:04] <dziegler> Jeroen__: you can use .parents() as well, see: https://jsfiddle.net/wx8w2u1L/4/
[06:00:44] <Jeroen__> Yes but for example, if I include twice the same template, doesn't it them remove from both the loaders>
[06:08:54] <dziegler> Jeroen__: if you have two .main_parent yes
[06:10:54] <dziegler> depends on your needs which code you use

[08:12:20] <sharax_> sorry disconnect
[08:12:31] <sharax_> please see my code
[08:12:31] <sharax_> http://kopy.io/xzjpI
[08:12:58] <sharax_> i need load function after end before function on each
[08:24:17] <sharax_> please help
[08:31:10] <hahnberger> can anybody tell me why this isnt working http://pastie.org/10760619
[08:40:00] <Cork> hahnberger: define "isn't working"
[08:41:31] <hahnberger> that alert statement is printing undefined for both
[08:57:41] <Debbie_> hello
[08:57:44] <Debbie_> I need some help!
[08:57:59] <Debbie_> <script> $('#upsell').submit(function (e) { 	$('#register').prop('disabled', true); 	$('.btn-success').addClass('disabled loading'); 	e.preventDefault(); 		$.ajax({ 			type: 'post', 			url: 'api-upsell.php', 			data: $(this).serialize(), 			success: function () { 				$('#upsell-alert').prepend("<div class='alert alert-success'><a href='#' class='close' data-dismiss='alert' aria-label='close'>&times;</a><strong>Success!</strong> Tha
[08:58:05] <Cork> hahnberger: you REALLY should move your js out of the html
[08:58:10] <Cork> makes it much simpler to debug it
[08:58:24] <Debbie_> OOps sorry, i thought it would ask about pastebin
[08:58:39] <Cork> Debbie_: use jsfiddle.net
[08:58:43] <Debbie_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6a04037ef0947822cb1a
[08:59:06] <Debbie_> I am runniing this ajax jquery to run a php script
[08:59:23] <Cork> hahnberger: there isn't enough info in that pb to tell why it isn't working
[08:59:36] <Debbie_> However I cant get 'done2' alert message to show up. Is there any way to make it so that if my php fails i get the error message
[08:59:52] <Debbie_> So in my php code if I write "XHAHHASBKHAFBL
[09:00:02] <Debbie_> as php code, i want the 2nd alert message to show up
[09:00:03] <Cork> Debbie_: your using .done and success: at the same time
[09:00:14] <Cork> i would recommend picking one and stick with it
[09:00:28] <Debbie_> I see but succss doesnt work
[09:00:37] <Debbie_> It will say SUCCESS no matter what
[09:00:57] <Debbie_> if i write "NASD AD A*D(A* AD" in my php code, it will still say thank you
[09:00:58] <Cork> Debbie_: is the server retunring a 4xx or 5xx status code?
[09:01:31] <Debbie_> I am not sure what that means
[09:02:11] <Cork> Debbie_: when you make a http request
[09:02:17] <Cork> the server responds with a status code
[09:02:39] <Cork> this code is what controls if success/done, fail/error is called
[09:02:57] <Debbie_> Do you mean like these: "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)"
[09:02:58] <Cork> 2xx == success/done, 4xx or 5xx == fail/error
[09:03:08] <Cork> no that is content
[09:04:04] <Debbie_> you mean the status codes like: 200 304 404 ?
[09:04:39] <Cork> yes
[09:04:52] <xom> Hi, I have a collection form that generates the two fields by two, but when I delete a field it is only one of the two is deleted, any idea? example : http://jsfiddle.net/847Kf/4/ my gist : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7022fb9de07c230ce3e6
[09:04:55] <Cork> ex. 404 Not Found
[09:05:13] <Debbie_> so it returns those ones then
[09:05:18] <Debbie_> 200 304 404
[09:05:47] <Cork> xom: use delegated event handler don't bind it on each link/button as you add them
[09:06:56] <Cork> xom: http://jsfiddle.net/847Kf/268/
[09:07:44] <Debbie_> How can i make that jquery detect a php error of any kind
[09:08:13] <Xatenev> Debbie_: wtf?
[09:08:37] <xom> Cork it works well but I just want it removes my two fields and not 1
[09:08:49] <Debbie_> ?
[09:09:07] <Xatenev> Debbie_: Jquery detect a php error?
[09:09:08] <Xatenev> w00t
[09:09:28] <Debbie_> yes because it is running ajax script
[09:09:35] <Xatenev> then fix your PHP
[09:09:49] <xom> I use : $(this).parent().remove();
[09:10:05] <Debbie_> But i mean it runs to the end and says success no matter what
[09:10:11] <Cork> xom: so you can't to remove all?
[09:10:37] <Cork> Debbie_: js doesn't know about php it only knows about what the server sends back
[09:10:54] <Cork> so check your response status
[09:11:05] <xom> I would like to remove tags (my tags will be displayed in pairs on my application)
[09:11:23] <Debbie_> how
[09:11:51] <Cork> Debbie_: open the browsers developer tools and inspect the response the server sends
[09:11:54] <xom> if I click on the cross, then my two tags that deletes
[09:12:03] <Cork> xom: your example doesn't create pairs
[09:12:15] <xom> tags currently only 1 of 2 is deleted
[09:12:24] <Debbie_> I want to make this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/20db55b23544316b4049 script report an error if it runs over something like this:     $lastFour = end($creditCards);     $lastFour = $lastFour['Last4'];     XXXXXXXX     // see if credit card exists. "XXXXXXX" is not php and will cause a crash, can I make my script just return a failure?
[09:12:27] <Cork> do you have an example matching what your looking for
[09:12:32] <xom> it's juste an example
[09:12:53] <Cork> Debbie_: again, you need to check the response status
[09:13:02] <Cork> the code doesn't help without knowing what the response looks like
[09:13:07] <Debbie_> it doesnt kick me one though
[09:13:41] <jomofcw> How can I perform a find on a HTML result of AJAX request please ? On my example when I perform "$(data).find('#myID')" it doesn't find anything whereas the "#myID" element is well present and the response HTML is WC validate.
[09:13:48] <jomofcw> Please.
[09:14:15] <Xentil> Debbie_:  http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ , take a look at .done() , .fail() , and always() functions
[09:14:33] <Cork> jomofcw: $(data).filter('#myID')
[09:14:34] <xom> how to select the parent and the first element of this parent?
[09:14:47] <Cork> jomofcw: if the element isn't a child it won't be found with .find
[09:14:48] <jomofcw> Hello Cork ^^ ! Thanks =).
[09:15:08] <Cork> .filter filters the outer most elements
[09:15:29] <Cork> xom: $(this).parent().children().first()
[09:16:09] <Cork> Xentil: the call already uses them, the problem is with the answer from the server
[09:16:27] <jomofcw> Cork OK... not sure to really understand, I shall read the doc closer :/.
[09:17:02] <Cork> '<div id="myID"></div>' vs '<article><div id="myID"></div></article>'
[09:17:15] <Cork> first needs .filter second needs .find
[09:17:25] <Cork> jomofcw: ^
[09:17:44] <Cork> damn i'm getting rusty...
[09:17:52] <Cork> i never forget to prefix >_<
[09:19:59] <xom> these are in a table, so in tr, can be that I can try to select the two last tr of the table and delete them?
[09:22:49] <hellyeah> using $.exten for merging object it is kind of concat
[09:22:57] <hellyeah> concat method does not work for object
[09:26:51] <h2m_> Hello everyone, it's possible to get the number of node between 2 elements ? My problem is that I have an array of various jQuery elements (img, div, section ect...), and I want to compare them with a specific element, in fact to get the closest element of the list with the specific element
[09:28:21] <hellyeah> h2m_:  do you have html markup or smt did you try anything? you can start with doing fiddle
[09:29:14] <h2m_> @hellyeah I do right now the fiddle
[09:29:51] <hellyeah> okey i wont guarantee anything but i may suggest you smt
[09:30:12] <taplar> you can do it!
[09:33:16] <profsimm> Folks, can I disable processData for the request data but not for the response data in $.ajax()?
[09:33:35] <profsimm> I need to send FormData so I turn off processing. But then I get back my JSON response as... text
[09:33:48] <taplar> you could just parse the response yourself
[09:34:29] <profsimm> taplar: I can, but I prefer to not duplicate existing logic. Maybe there's a function in jQuery I can call manually that processes a response?
[09:34:47] <taplar> JSON.parse or $.parseJSON
[09:34:57] <profsimm> taplar: That's just for JSON, I need to handle everything jQuery does
[09:35:03] <taplar> ?
[09:35:08] <profsimm> taplar: XML and so on
[09:35:17] <taplar> your one endpoint can return json and xml?
[09:35:51] <profsimm> taplar: it's a library, it's not written for any one specific endpoint. I want to transparently enable passing File isntances in data, which jQuery doesn't support, the rest should be unchanged
[09:36:22] <taplar> so your building a plugin?
[09:36:29] <profsimm> taplar: I got the request part down, now I need to just figure out what jQuery calls in itself to process a response.
[09:36:37] <profsimm> taplar: yes, it's a decorator, but basically like a plugin
[09:37:05] <taplar> you could always let the users provide the callback to handle the response.  they'd know if the response is json or xml
[09:37:10] <taplar> or something else
[09:38:11] <profsimm> taplar: can you please point me where in the code jQuery receives the raw response?
[09:38:47] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=$.ajax
[09:40:22] <profsimm> taplar: I don't see it tbh
[09:40:32] <taplar> you'll have to dig, :)
[09:41:23] <Debbie_> the .failure doesn't work because it doesn't catch php syntax errors as a failure
[09:41:36] <taplar> ?
[09:41:50] <taplar> php syntax errors would be a server side error
[09:42:08] <hellyeah> i did it
[09:42:09] <hellyeah> aha
[09:42:10] <hellyeah> !
[09:42:47] <Debbie_> How should I do this then? I have a form with a php action. I want to run this code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/20db55b23544316b4049 . But the problem is that it ALWAYS says the payment was successful
[09:43:19] <taplar> saying it's a success meaning it calls the success callback?
[09:43:31] <hellyeah> payment is done
[09:43:41] <hellyeah> bvrb
[09:43:42] <hellyeah> brb
[09:43:47] <Debbie_> you mean make a note at the end of the php
[09:43:47] <Debbie_> ?
[09:44:00] <Leentje> Debbie_:
[09:44:03] <Leentje> in the success statement
[09:44:04] <hellyeah> wut
[09:44:06] <Leentje> check on the response data
[09:44:13] <Leentje> and then act accordingly
[09:44:19] <taplar> ^^^
[09:44:20] <Leentje> so, php sends back true/false for instance
[09:44:27] <Leentje> handle that in the success call
[09:44:37] <Leentje> the error handler is for when unexpected stuff happens
[09:44:44] <taplar> success for an ajax call is simply dependent upon the response code being 200
[09:44:45] <Leentje> implement that accordingly too
[09:44:46] <Xatenev> Debbie_: There should NEVER be a PHP syntax error :/
[09:44:52] <taplar> ^^^
[09:47:57] <profsimm> taplar: this "ajaxConvert" where is it defined?
[09:49:57] <taplar> that's a good question...
[09:50:39] <taplar> it's a function in the base
[09:50:44] <taplar> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.1.js <-- search for it
[09:53:36] <profsimm> taplar: another question is I can't see why processData affects response decoding.
[09:53:48] <profsimm> taplar: because it seems to only be checked for the input data processing.
[09:53:50] <profsimm> O_o
[09:54:25] <taplar> according to the docs it does not
[09:54:46] <taplar> so what's the issue again?  it's returning json and it's not decoding it for you?
[09:55:49] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:55:54] <taplar> look at 'dataType'
[09:56:02] <taplar> if you define that it will expect that
[09:56:13] <taplar> otherwise it will intelligently guess based on the returned mime type
[09:56:34] <taplar> so if its not decoding it as you expect, i'd expect neither of those are set correctly
[09:59:19] <profsimm> taplar: I pass this as null as I always have.
[09:59:23] <profsimm> Dunno
[09:59:31] <profsimm> taplar: if I explicitly pass "json" it decodes
[09:59:44] <profsimm> taplar:  however the mime type of the response is correct, so it should detect it.
[09:59:48] <profsimm> taplar: application/json
[09:59:59] <taplar> your returning that as your content type?
[10:00:06] <profsimm> From the server, yes
[10:00:13] <taplar> but you set dataType: null?
[10:00:23] <profsimm> Yes.
[10:00:27] <taplar> try not setting it at all
[10:00:30] <taplar> brb
[10:00:33] <profsimm> I thought, but.
[10:00:39] <profsimm> Ok, thanks
[10:03:02] <profsimm> Ok, that's odd, maybe this has nothing to do with my plugin.
[10:03:15] <profsimm> I get undecoded JSON text on a plain request as well.
[10:05:30] <Debbie_> Why cant I see this on my main page? I have that ajax success action. using these php form variables:         $_SESSION['result'] = $result;             $test = $_SESSION['result'];
[10:05:37] <Debbie_> alert('<?php echo $test ?>');
[10:08:21] <rtd1123> Debbie_: It is not good practice to insert a PHP variable inside a Javascript function.
[10:08:55] <rtd1123> you would want to use the variable nested in your success: function(data)...i.e. data
[10:09:26] <h2m_> HELLO, PLEASE HELP ME : https://jsfiddle.net/u73446op/4/
[10:10:12] <taplar> what's your issue?
[10:10:42] <taplar> define 'closest'
[10:11:33] <ktosiek> hi! Is there any way to call the ready handlers early?
[10:11:38] <h2m_> compared to the superposing of the layers
[10:11:51] <h2m_> @taplar
[10:12:04] <taplar> you mean closest as in their positioning on the page?
[10:12:11] <taplar> ktosiek: can you elaborate?
[10:13:04] <ktosiek> I want to move some costly parts of a page to the end of the body, and then put them in their place with JS. This lets me send most of the page before I start computing the heavy parts.
[10:13:50] <ktosiek> But a lot of JS on that page uses $(function () { ... }) for initialization, and now I want to initialize those parts between "most of the page" and "async parts"
[10:14:04] <ktosiek> before the page is really loaded
[10:14:25] <Xatenev> ktosiek: you should just load the costly stuff via ajax too
[10:14:41] <Xatenev> its the better version of loading it at the end and putting it in its place by JS.
[10:14:41] <taplar> you could always define those functions outside the doc ready and use them where ever
[10:14:55] <ktosiek> Xatenev: that's a much bigger change, and I was hoping for a quick win on a heavily used page
[10:15:27] <Xatenev> ktosiek: please be good and dont choose the quick n dirty solution :O
[10:15:59] <ktosiek> but why :-<
[10:16:06] <taplar> cause it's good practice
[10:16:23] <ktosiek> I'd have to make new endpoints, and actually refactor a gigantic view :-C
[10:16:30] <taplar> quick fixes usually equate to bandaids which lead to spagetti code
[10:17:18] <ktosiek> the worst part is that I know that :-/
[10:17:46] <ktosiek> ok, I'll try to at least just move the initialization out of $() and into late <script> tags
[10:19:24] <Xatenev> ktosiek: I would just put your elements into the very end of the body then
[10:19:32] <Xatenev> and $(element).load(function() { // move them to the place }
[10:19:41] <Xatenev> by putting them at the end of body they will be load at the end automatically.
[10:19:49] <Xatenev> https://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[10:20:03] <taplar> or stick them in a template and place them whenever your ready
[10:20:56] <profsimm> taplar: turns out I thought I'm setting request type with mimeType, and I've been setting response type.
[10:21:13] <profsimm> taplar: that's kinda misleading. contentType = request mime; mimeType = response mime
[10:21:19] <profsimm> Wut.
[10:21:46] <taplar> hmm, dunno.  i'm just familiar with the php way which is just setHeader so whatever that does, ^_^
[10:22:46] <taplar> err, header()
[10:23:13] * taplar walks around babbling
[10:26:06] <ktosiek> Xatenev: it's not the moved elements I'm concerned about, it's the rest of the page (that I want to init before loading the heavy parts)
[10:26:31] <Xatenev> ktosiek: Like I said, moving it to the end of the body as last elements will automatically make it load at the end
[10:26:35] <Xatenev> (Normally)
[10:43:05] <profsimm> taplar: oh I forgot, also dataType is "suggest mimeType" so we have three synonyms, contentType, dataType, mimeType, which do completely different things.
[10:43:15] <profsimm> I love jQuery, but sometimes, it's just stupid.
[10:50:35] <Cork> profsimm: don't blame jquery for a separate plugins naming choice
[10:51:00] <profsimm> Cork: that's all in the core.
[10:51:17] <Cork> ah.. >_< read dataType as dataTable...
[10:52:48] <Cork> profsimm: well most of them you don't have to care about unless your hacking on core
[10:53:12] <Cork> what matters is dataType (what content to ask for from the server) and contentType (what content is submitted)
[10:55:16] <profsimm> Cork: btw, any idea why jQuery has no native support for FormData or File/Blob yet?
[10:55:31] <profsimm> Cork: reason I'm hacking on core is it's 2016 and everything supports XHR2 except jQuery
[10:55:39] <Cork> profsimm: not sure what you say that
[10:55:47] <Cork> just disable the encoder and it work just fine
[10:55:56] <Cork> been using it for years now
[10:56:31] <profsimm> Cork: it works fine if I build my own FormData. But that's not convenient. I need to duplicate a lot of logic, like converting foo.bar.baz = file;  to "foo[bar][baz]", file etc.
[10:56:58] <profsimm> Cork: what I'm doing is allowing passing in objects with JSON-compatible data and it also supports File instances in there that get sent as files.
[10:57:08] <profsimm> Cork: it's way better than building FormData instances manually
[10:57:56] <Cork> profsimm: $.ajax(url, { data: new FormData($('form')[0]), processData: false, contentType: false }).done()
[10:58:04] <Cork> works well for me
[10:58:56] <profsimm> Cork: I'm not sending a form. I'm sending an object tree that happens to have some File instances in it
[10:59:08] <shoky> profsimm: i agree with all your points, fwiw ;p
[10:59:10] <profsimm> Cork: there's no $('form') to select :P
[10:59:31] <Cork> well then there isn't much jquery can help you with
[10:59:51] <Cork> you need a formData object to reference files
[10:59:53] <profsimm> shoky: well I guess I can publish that patch :P I wonder if core will accept it. It's not that complex.
[10:59:56] <Cork> so you need to build it first
[11:00:13] <profsimm> Cork: you don't need to pass it in manually, jQuery can build it itself
[11:00:19] <profsimm> Cork: from the object.
[11:00:41] <profsimm> Cork:  I mean could. It doesn't right now.
[11:01:31] <Cork> profsimm: i can't say i care too much, but the reason is most likely cause older ie doesn't support it (does ie11 support it?)
[11:01:52] <Cork> when they drop support for browsers without it they most likely will move over to it
[11:02:05] <Cork> but again, don't really care
[11:02:08] <ul71m0> So i have a page with masonry grid, and im loading 30 new items with ajax load more, but because those are 30 new images it loads for quite a while, and i cant trigger masonry to reload until it loads all the images, but while its loading they are all over the place and layout looks broken, is there a way to hide only new elements that are added over ajax until they fully load
[11:02:50] <profsimm> Cork, IE10+ supports it, and there's a fallback with iframes that works for a lot of the API
[11:03:14] <profsimm> Cork: the "jQuery Form" plugin (Malsup) implements the fallback.
[11:03:16] <Cork> profsimm: ya, but core won't accept a solution that requires iframes
[11:03:38] <profsimm> Cork: yeah, but who cares for IE9 users.
[11:03:38] <Cork> supported browsers should support the solution without hacks
[11:03:47] <Cork> profsimm: currently jquery core does
[11:03:51] <profsimm> Cork: supported browsers don't need iframes.
[11:04:01] <Cork> profsimm: including ie9?
[11:04:07] <profsimm> Wait, why is IE9 supported again?
[11:04:14] <profsimm> On my sites it's at 0.1%, literally.
[11:04:20] <profsimm> There are more IE8 users than IE9
[11:04:22] <profsimm> that's nonsense
[11:04:29] <Cork> in other markets it is 80% of the traffic
[11:04:35] <profsimm> Cork: no such markets.
[11:04:38] <Cork> there is
[11:04:49] <profsimm> Cork: no, there are far more IE8 users than IE9 and IE10 combined
[11:04:58] <Cork> at least there was ~5 months back when i last saw a blogpost about it
[11:05:11] <profsimm> You're stuck with Ie8 on XP, on Vista+ if you can run IE9, you get IE11 automatically with updates
[11:06:07] <Cork> profsimm: the point is, jquery 2.0 support ie9, so things need to work in the supported browser span without hacks
[11:06:17] <Cork> 3.0 might drop it, but i'm not sure there
[11:06:31] <Cork> it is the same reason why <script> error events isn't supported in 1.x
[11:06:41] <Cork> older ie doesn't support it
[11:06:56] <hellyeah> hey there
[11:07:04] <Cork> lowest common denominator is used (unless it can be polly filled without hacks)
[11:09:28] <profsimm> Cork, if iframe works...
[11:09:30] <nsanden> i have a $('body').on('change', '.checkbox', function () { console.log('fired'); }); but it doesnt fire that event if i change the .checkbox with javascript. is there a way to look for that?
[11:09:53] <Cork> profsimm: by hack i mean if you can't solve it with js
[11:10:00] <hellyeah> nsanden:  fiddle it
[11:10:14] <Cork> adding separate pages in iframes in the page isn't a polly fill
[11:10:23] <Cork> it is a dirty hack around a solution you want to use
[11:10:39] <profsimm> Cork: separate pages?
[11:10:54] <Cork> profsimm: yes, as in iframes is a separate document
[11:11:12] <Cork> if you create that document with js or a http request makes little difference
[11:11:47] <Scriptonaut> Hey all, I'm using $.ajax to post to my server. The server responds with 200 OK, but the error callback is getting called. I put a debugger in there, and the status is 200, the responseText is empty, and the statusText is "OK". Why is it invoking the error callback?
[11:11:50] <profsimm> Cork: I'm not sure why that's relevant, if it's a separate document.
[11:12:05] <Cork> profsimm: cause again, it is a hack
[11:13:01] <Cork> profsimm: when these kind of situations happen, it usually goes as, you use a plugin, pick if you need the support for the none supported browser or not
[11:13:13] <Cork> and when the support becomes unison it gets moved into core
[11:13:18] <Cork> (if enough ppl need it)
[11:13:22] <profsimm> Cork what defines a "hack"
[11:13:41] <Cork> profsimm: if it is a feature you can translate into supported
[11:13:43] <jomofcw> Cork OK, but my "data" is a full HTML and #myID isn't a direct child of BODY... so I missunderstood it (but it works).
[11:13:46] <Cork> then it is a pollyfill
[11:14:05] <Cork> jomofcw: ajax can't handle full html pages
[11:14:07] <profsimm> Cork, that's what you can do with the iframe. Support fake FormData
[11:14:32] <Cork> jomofcw: if you send a full page dom error correction strips everything from body and up (including body)
[11:15:00] <Scriptonaut> I think it's because I have: dataType: "json", but I'm posting json, not returning json, so it gets empty responseText, and thinks it's malformed json
[11:15:14] <Scriptonaut> how do I tell $.ajax that I only want to post json, I don't want to get it back
[11:15:15] <jomofcw> Cork OK, but why an element that is deep inside the HTML structure can be recover then using fiulter and not using find ?
[11:15:40] <Cork> jomofcw: filter works directly on the jquery object
[11:15:54] <Debbie_> hey I cant base my code off of status errors because it is always 200
[11:15:56] <Cork> jomofcw: it doesn't use the dom, it loops the jquery result set and looks for a matching dom element
[11:16:02] <nsanden> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/4mv7q556/
[11:16:10] <Debbie_> No matter what, as long as the code runs it is 200
[11:16:19] <Cork> jomofcw: while .find loops the elements in the jquery result sets and loops for children of that element
[11:16:32] <jomofcw> Hm OK... anyway, Cork,in your opinion, I've better to clean the HTML, just keeping the inner HTML of BODY before send it through AJAX ?
[11:16:33] <shoky> Scriptonaut:  don't use dataType: 'json'  if the response is not valid json.  just don't use a dataType, or if you have a wrong content-type header in the response then you can use  dataType: 'text'
[11:16:39] <Cork> Debbie_: then you have to check for other things in the success callback
[11:16:58] <Cork> Debbie_: cause the request is successfull, the different handlers have nothing to go on
[11:16:59] <Debbie_> how would i set something like that up
[11:17:08] <Debbie_> I see that part
[11:17:08] <Cork> jomofcw: yes, every time
[11:17:22] <jomofcw> Cork OK ^^. Thanks for your help !
[11:17:28] <hellyeah> nsanden:  i am sorry but can you repeat your question?
[11:17:34] <shoky> Scriptonaut: and if your request body is itself json then you'll want  contentType: 'application/json'  or smth
[11:17:44] <Scriptonaut> ah
[11:17:44] <jomofcw> See ya guys !
[11:17:44] <Scriptonaut> ok
[11:17:55] <Cork> Debbie_: $.ajax(url).done(function(data) { if(data /* check for something that indicate state 1 */) {} else {} });
[11:18:04] <geri> how could i build the following more efficient, possible as a template? http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/8/
[11:18:08] <Cork> Debbie_: or fix the server to send the correct status code (the correct fix)
[11:18:28] <nsanden> heres a better example: https://jsfiddle.net/4mv7q556/1/
[11:18:43] <nsanden> hellyeah: question is, i have a $('body').on('change', '.checkbox', function () { console.log('fired'); }); but it doesnt fire that event if i change the .checkbox with javascript. is there a way to look for that?
[11:19:44] <hellyeah> what do you mean change by javascript? I dont get that part
[11:19:58] <nsanden> when i click "test" button, i expect to get in console "fired"
[11:20:09] <Scriptonaut> shoky: when I do: contentType: "application/json", the request params are empty
[11:20:11] <Scriptonaut> on my server side
[11:20:25] <shoky> Scriptonaut: what do you mean by `request params`?
[11:20:26] <nsanden> because test button changes the checked value of a checkbox
[11:20:33] <Scriptonaut> https://gist.github.com/robins35/8683ae8df5851bb235a2
[11:20:35] <Scriptonaut> shoky: ^^
[11:20:41] <Scriptonaut> the data
[11:20:49] <Cork> geri: http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/9/
[11:20:50] <shoky> Scriptonaut:  that's not json
[11:21:07] <Scriptonaut> when I do: JSON.stringify(), it turns it into a malformed hash
[11:21:12] <hellyeah> nsanden:  test button where is test button?
[11:21:16] <Scriptonaut> it's an array
[11:21:18] <shoky> Scriptonaut: malformed hash..?
[11:21:19] <Cork> geri: keep the html in the html document, not in the js files
[11:21:26] <nsanden> its here https://jsfiddle.net/4mv7q556/2/
[11:21:51] <Scriptonaut> so, this.layout is an array, it turns it into: { "1" => { "2" => "3" => ... }}}
[11:21:52] <shoky> Scriptonaut: do you want to send a json body or not. what is your server expecting? is it expecting regular post param named `layout` ?
[11:21:59] <shoky> Scriptonaut: ah
[11:22:03] <Scriptonaut> I just want to send it an array
[11:22:05] <Scriptonaut> a 2d array
[11:22:26] <BG> Revolution Slider Error: You have some jquery.js library include that comes after the revolution files js include.
[11:22:35] <BG> i have only one loaded
[11:22:42] <BG> and its first
[11:22:52] <shoky> Scriptonaut: what is your server expecting. json or post paramss?
[11:23:12] <Scriptonaut> I figured json was the best way to send it
[11:23:16] <Scriptonaut> how else could I send an array?
[11:23:22] <Scriptonaut> a 2d array that is
[11:23:27] <shoky> Scriptonaut: what does the original array look like in js
[11:23:28] <Scriptonaut> I just assumed json was the way to do it
[11:23:46] <hellyeah> nsanden:  there is no test button there
[11:23:47] <Debbie_> OKAY I like what you said ....
[11:23:50] <Scriptonaut> it's like: this.layout = [[x, y, z], [a, b, c], ...]
[11:23:56] <Scriptonaut> where x, y, z are strings
[11:24:01] <Debbie_> BUT
[11:24:07] <shoky> Scriptonaut:  there is a difference between sending the whole request body as json,  and sending a regular post (form) param named layout (whose value might be json or not)
[11:24:20] <Debbie_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9af83b3af6991187a487
[11:24:30] <Cork> geri: an even cleaner solution http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/10/
[11:24:42] <Scriptonaut> it's not a form post
[11:24:42] <Debbie_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9af83b3af6991187a487 The problem here is that, I have 2 php pages. one the view, the other the ACTION for my php form.
[11:24:46] <nsanden> hellyeah: err there is on my screen https://i.imgur.com/FjXHrTx.png
[11:24:54] <shoky> Scriptonaut:  ok then you can use JSON.stringify  for example-   data: {layout: JSON.stringify(this.layout)}
[11:24:55] <Scriptonaut> I just want to send that one layout variable (the nested array)
[11:25:01] <Scriptonaut> ok, I'll try that
[11:25:05] <shoky> Scriptonaut: doesnt' matter if it's not a form post. it matters if your backend expects form params
[11:25:05] <Debbie_> but How can I make it produce actuall errors othan 200 ?
[11:25:16] <Scriptonaut> shouldn't the JSON.stringify go around the entire object?
[11:25:25] <shoky> Scriptonaut: e.g.  in php if you do  $_POST["layout"]  then that's NOT a json body
[11:25:28] <Debbie_> as long as my script runs i get a 200 OK error, so I can run all the fails, or always, or dune jquery functions
[11:25:37] <shoky> Scriptonaut:  depends what you want to send :)
[11:25:56] <shoky> Scriptonaut: which depends on what your backend is expecting/how it's parsing the body, as i've been saying
[11:26:27] <shoky> Scriptonaut:  if you do it like i suggested then you will get a post param called layout,  whose value is a json string which you need to parse in your backend code
[11:26:31] <nsanden> hellyeah: i think i found the answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4869981/why-isnt-my-checkbox-change-event-triggered
[11:26:46] <shoky> Scriptonaut: e.g.  in php it'd be smth like  json_decode($_POST["layout"])
[11:26:51] <Scriptonaut> hmm, I did it like you said, I get no params, just an empty object
[11:26:58] <Scriptonaut> I have a ruby backend by the way, Rack
[11:26:59] <shoky> Scriptonaut:  and that goes with out setting contentType
[11:27:07] <Scriptonaut> so I'm going: request.params, which is == {}
[11:27:15] <Scriptonaut> oh, well I did set contentType
[11:27:19] <Scriptonaut> I'll unset it I suppose
[11:27:25] <shoky> ok, don't. cause now you're sending regular form params
[11:27:34] <Scriptonaut> ah ok
[11:27:35] <shoky> (whose value is a json string)
[11:28:04] <hellyeah> glad for you nsanden
[11:28:22] <Scriptonaut> hmm, so I'm not sure why my request params are an empty object
[11:28:34] <shoky> show your current code
[11:29:11] <Scriptonaut> alright
[11:29:34] <Scriptonaut> shoky:
[11:29:41] <Scriptonaut> whoops
[11:29:45] <Scriptonaut> https://gist.github.com/robins35/8683ae8df5851bb235a2
[11:29:50] <Scriptonaut> there ya go
[11:30:03] <shoky> well i told ya, don't set contentType..
[11:30:28] <Scriptonaut> oh, I thought you told me not to unset it
[11:30:42] <shoky> heh sry
[11:30:48] <Jeroen__> If I do $(element).show() it shows from left to right, but I want from bottom to top. How could I do that?
[11:31:05] <Scriptonaut> oh wow, I think that worked
[11:31:13] <Scriptonaut> I get a string that looks like it's formatted correctly
[11:31:19] <Scriptonaut> should I bet getting a string, or an object/array?
[11:31:43] <shoky> a string, yes. you need to json parse it, however yuo do that in ruby
[11:34:32] <Jeroen__> Got it :)
[11:35:26] <Scriptonaut> thanks shoky
[11:35:28] <Scriptonaut> I think I got it
[11:35:37] <shoky> np
[11:55:56] <geri> hi Cork thanks, i changed my code a bit... how could you still improve the code? http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/12/
[11:56:13] <geri> Cork: could you also create some sort of template for the dialog to be opened?
[12:05:22] <rtd1123> I am working on a drag and drop interface for a room booking system and need a little assistance with the handlers. https://jsfiddle.net/rtd1123/s6sfg7wn/
[12:06:14] <Debbie_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/346ec6443b42f3dae1ca
[12:06:20] <Debbie_> It keeps going to the 400 response code. If I take out the 400, it will THEN GO TO 200
[12:06:34] <Debbie_> I cant get the basic branch to go
[12:06:55] <albedoa> brain fart: i have an array of objects $items. how do i use each() on just the items that have data attribute 'foo'?
[12:07:05] <albedoa> or do i have to check each one for foo?
[12:07:07] <taplar> filter them
[12:07:14] <albedoa> derp, thanks
[12:07:35] <debbie_> hello
[12:08:40] <taplar> debbie_: are you sure your request is correct?
[12:08:47] <debbie_> what do you mean?
[12:08:58] <debbie_> I thought I can just force any response code I would like ?
[12:09:10] <taplar> ah, nvm, i was concerned with the setting of data for a sec
[12:09:16] <taplar> uh, no
[12:09:25] <taplar> the endpoint returns the response code
[12:09:38] <debbie_> I have a simple php branch, if succes then response = 200, else response = 300
[12:10:15] <taplar> are you manually setting it to 300?
[12:10:29] <taplar> from the endpoint?
[12:10:31] <debbie_> Yes: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/346ec6443b42f3dae1ca
[12:10:41] <debbie_> the thing is, when I remove one code, the other works
[12:10:45] <taplar> ok, don't do that
[12:10:48] <taplar> use a different code
[12:10:51] <debbie_> so I can see the error and success message
[12:10:57] <debbie_> like what? anything ? 5641
[12:11:09] <taplar> it depends on the situation
[12:11:21] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
[12:11:40] <taplar> and an ajax call can't be successful and an error...
[12:12:12] <taplar> what is the error you are trying to reflect in your status code?
[12:12:46] <debbie_> It doesn't matter for now.... I just want it to say payment accepted or not
[12:12:49] <debbie_> so TRUE or FALSE
[12:12:59] <taplar> uh, so that's not really a response code
[12:13:21] <debbie_> Yes I know!
[12:13:29] <debbie_> so how can i display this error
[12:13:40] <taplar> it'd be better to return 200 and put something on the response that tells you if that was true or false
[12:14:03] <debbie_> yes, but you are not getting my problem....
[12:14:16] <debbie_> I CAN swap my error message based on the response code now
[12:14:24] <debbie_> I am manually sending the respnse via php
[12:14:39] <debbie_> However my branch is JUST taking whatever response is last
[12:14:43] <taplar> can and should are two different things
[12:15:06] <robertmaxrees> debbie_ you realize you can only respond to a request once, right?
[12:15:31] <debbie_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/346ec6443b42f3dae1ca so in this gist.... it will show me an error message, but if I delete the 400 then it will show success
[12:15:51] <debbie_> so it is showing me the latest response code's logic
[12:17:02] <robertmaxrees> debbie_ do you understand how done/fail work?
[12:17:29] <debbie_> not entirely...
[12:17:36] <debbie_> I have a good guess based on the naming...
[12:17:41] <robertmaxrees> fail is fired when there's an actual error.
[12:17:54] <geri> re
[12:17:56] <robertmaxrees> depending on the response code / validity of returned data.
[12:18:06] <debbie_> yes.... which it is getting, isn't it? via a 400 response code
[12:18:50] <debbie_> http_response_code(418); THIS WORKS
[12:18:52] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what your actual response looks like :) have you checked your network tab to make sure you're sending back the response you think you're getting?
[12:18:56] <debbie_> it shows an error....
[12:19:56] <debbie_> my problem isnt with the response code, its more about a simple if/else branch
[12:20:09] <robertmaxrees> so your question is regarding your php?
[12:20:50] <nitrospectide> I am currently using this: https://github.com/peachananr/subscribe-better but it appears to be locking up in the new MS Edge browser. I need to either mod this, or find an alternative. It basically just pops a modal based on time, scrolling, etc so I can display an offer.
[12:20:57] <nitrospectide> Anyone have suggestions?
[12:22:01] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide have you profiled the browser to see why that's happening?
[12:22:09] <robertmaxrees> and i'd just build that on my own.
[12:22:40] <geri> Cork: could you also create some sort of template for the dialog to be opened?
[12:23:04] <robertmaxrees> geri you don't need to spam them ;)
[12:23:23] <geri> robertmaxrees: ok :D
[12:26:30] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: You mean just run it with the inspector and watch for the glitch in the console? I have to contact someone that has the browser. It's not a deep, complicated script, but I'm really not a hardcore coder, so I haven't looked into the guts of it really.
[12:26:50] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide you can do that part on your own though.
[12:27:03] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: Which part?
[12:27:08] <robertmaxrees> the profiling.
[12:37:34] <rtd1123> I am working on a drag and drop interface for a room booking system and need a little assistance with the handlers. https://jsfiddle.net/rtd1123/s6sfg7wn/7/
[12:37:58] <rtd1123> when you try to drag the black boxes it gets all messed up
[12:39:15] <rtd1123> I need the group of black boxes to all stay together and be draggabled into another set of 8 cells, for example
[12:39:16] <taplar_lunch> one thing, your binding in an event handler
[12:39:26] <decx> and what kind of data are you imagining you can get out of a table
[12:39:31] <decx> separate data in presentation
[12:39:34] <decx> and*
[12:40:22] <robertmaxrees> lol i asked "why use a table" yesterday.
[12:40:26] <rtd1123> I really just need to be able to pull the ID of the reservation which is stored in data attributes, with that I can create/edit/delete reservations on the fly
[12:40:52] <taplar_lunch> jui works with tables made of divs, fwiw
[12:41:05] <rtd1123> robertmaxrees: are you saying that I should reconstruct tabular data into a div layout?
[12:42:09] <taplar_lunch> could help you not reinvent the wheel
[12:42:27] <decx> it's not tabular data tho is it
[12:42:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue that you don't have tabular data, and even if you did, the limitations inherent to tables is getting in your way.
[12:42:31] <decx> it's an interface
[12:42:33] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:42:38] <decx> to populate 2 input fields
[12:42:54] <rtd1123> fair enough, then I shall destroy all the tables!
[12:42:59] <rtd1123> back to the drawing board
[12:43:05] <rtd1123> thanks for the input
[12:43:12] <robertmaxrees> you said you had a solution yesterday.
[12:43:24] <rtd1123> That failed miserably
[12:43:32] <robertmaxrees> becuase you were using a table.
[12:43:40] <rtd1123> This is as far as I've gotten
[12:45:05] <taplar_lunch> funny the things we'll do to avoid input boxes
[12:45:15] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:47:35] <taplar_lunch> or does it have to be draggable?
[12:47:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:47:42] <taplar_lunch> why can't i just click on the times i want?
[12:49:09] <decx> back to the table it is then
[12:49:13] <decx> clicking cells is easy
[12:49:33] <taplar_lunch> i can just imagine users clicking cells and nothing happening and being like wtf?
[12:49:41] <robertmaxrees> tons of ways to do this.
[12:58:47] <DeltaHeavy> Can I ask general JS questions here including ones about Node? I understand this is a jQuery channel but the channels this would be more specific towards don't offer an inclusive environment for those with opposing viewpoints.
[12:59:04] <robertmaxrees> you can ask, but there's no guarantee you'll get an answer.
[12:59:14] <taplar_lunch> lol, sounds rather loaded
[13:00:45] <robertmaxrees> heh.  what's the question DeltaHeavy?
[13:01:48] <taplar_lunch> maybe he was just casing the joint
[13:04:13] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Understood, and totally understandable. And I have none yet but I won't have anything to do with said channels I shall not name publicly. I write a lot of JS and tend to avoid jQuery where I can these days so I'm fairly active, but not so much within the scope of 'jQuery'.
[13:04:33] <DeltaHeavy> taplar_lunch SJW crap. Literally blowing my mind right now but this isn't the place to talk about such things :p
[13:04:58] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy honestly, this channel really needs to stay at least relatively on-topic since it's the official support channel.
[13:05:27] <robertmaxrees> like, I can appreciate feeling frustrated, but that doesn't mean this channel serves as a substitute, if that makes sense.
[13:06:03] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Understood. Perhaps if I'm too off-topic somebody can point it out and the boundaries can be established then, or now if you want to define them more clearly. And I agree as well, I won't complain if I'm told I need to be OT.
[13:06:14] <geri> robertmaxrees: Cork seems busy.... could you explain?
[13:06:26] <DeltaHeavy> And I'm generally pretty active as far as helping others as well so I won't just leech.
[13:06:43] <decx> DeltaHeavy: we're doing everything here
[13:06:48] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[13:06:51] <decx> lifeprotip: join #jquery
[13:07:08] <DeltaHeavy> decx Awesome :)
[13:07:12] <robertmaxrees> if you want specifics, the channel is about jquery.  if you don't want to discuss the library, it's not really the right place to go.  that being said, we end up talking about lots of other things.
[13:07:16] <decx> best thing
[13:07:18] <decx> you can say shit
[13:07:21] <taplar_lunch> i'd say just don't spam the room with the off topic stuff and if you get ignored due to someone asking an on topic question, don't take it hard
[13:07:27] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:07:39] <robertmaxrees> and don't be offended if somebody points out you're being WAY OT.
[13:07:52] <robertmaxrees> geri just ask your question to the channel.
[13:07:54] <decx> if we want OT we go to frontend
[13:07:55] <decx> ^^
[13:07:58] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:09:19] <geri> how can this code be improved in form of a template or any other way? http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/12/
[13:09:32] <taplar_lunch> ohh i love these
[13:09:42] <DeltaHeavy> taplar_lunch I don't do that in general so I don't think it would be a problem.
[13:09:45] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Yep, same page.
[13:09:57] <taplar_lunch> DeltaHeavy: just throwing it out there, :)
[13:10:40] <taplar_lunch> geri: lets see.  what's up with the intermixing of doc ready and non-doc ready logic?
[13:11:03] <DeltaHeavy> taplar_lunch Yup, voiced my original comment just to establish said boundaries and I guess that's what we did.
[13:11:36] <geri> taplar_lunch: you refer to $(document).on("click", "#btn", function() ?
[13:12:03] <taplar_lunch> no, ln 4 and then everything outside it
[13:12:49] <decx> what's the point of counting up
[13:13:20] <geri> decx: just a demo. i plan to update the dialog when its opened
[13:13:31] <taplar_lunch> the element on ln 11 could be cached and used instead of wrapping $(this) and looking it up in the inner parts
[13:14:34] <taplar_lunch> i don't see an id change/removal of the modal, so technically the body will have a duplicate id
[13:14:48] <taplar_lunch> you could fix that my making it a template
[13:14:52] <taplar_lunch> or class
[13:15:52] <rtd1123> taplar_lunch & robertmaxrees: The point of the UI is so that existing reservsations can be draggable to unfilled spots so they can change the time. They will be able to highlight multiple cells to create a reservation in that span, or finally click on an individual cell to create a reservation starting at that time or view an existing reservation's information.
[13:16:43] <geri> taplar: could you show that template with a short jsfiddle?
[13:16:51] <taplar> sure
[13:16:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:17:12] <taplar> wait
[13:17:22] <taplar> crap i'm blind today, your already doing that
[13:17:56] <geri> taplar: when the user edits the dialog, this callback is triggered... is that the typical way to do it?
[13:17:58] * taplar pays more attention to his cc cookie
[13:18:36] <taplar> which part?
[13:18:59] <geri> taplar: line 24: $("#myForm").submit(function(e) {
[13:19:31] <taplar> that's fine.  what' i'm saying is you could already have a reference to it
[13:19:44] <geri> taplar: i plan to add multiple edits... so i will have multiple forms triggering those callbacks...
[13:20:50] <taplar> you'll only have one modal open at a time, no?
[13:21:14] <geri> taplar: not sure yet. i guess so for now
[13:22:00] <taplar> so you could store $('<div id="dlg"></div>') in a var and use that var in the submit binding
[13:22:40] <taplar> no?
[13:24:41] <geri> taplar: i think so, what is the advantage?
[13:24:52] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/13/
[13:24:57] <taplar> less touching the dom
[13:25:04] <taplar> lookups
[13:25:12] <taplar> jQuery object creations
[13:25:22] <taplar> DRY
[13:25:47] <geri> taplar: i see
[13:26:21] <taplar> in general you want to minimize those
[13:27:35] <taplar> also you might consider changing your setInterval to a setTimeout
[13:27:42] <taplar> that thing is running all the time
[13:28:26] <taplar> otherwise, start it when you open the modal, and clear it when you close
[13:29:16] <robertmaxrees> more than one modal at a time is a nightmare.
[13:29:29] <geri> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[13:29:39] <robertmaxrees> was still scrolled up - sorry.
[13:29:46] <taplar> modals usually employ an overlay
[13:29:52] <robertmaxrees> was responding to the idea of having multiple modals open at a time.
[13:29:59] <robertmaxrees> didn't mean to derail >.>
[13:30:14] <taplar> and modals are usually used to force/draw attention
[13:30:18] <decx> multiple modals works fine
[13:30:38] <decx> like i have several tinymce button plugins that can interact between modals and it works well enough
[13:30:39] <robertmaxrees> D:
[13:30:53] <robertmaxrees> how do you have multiples open at the same time?
[13:30:59] <decx> just open them
[13:31:02] <robertmaxrees> and have that visually look ok.
[13:31:06] <decx> ye
[13:32:12] <taplar> dunno, i've only ever used them as prompt like notices/inputs where having multiple wouldn't make sense
[13:33:51] <sharax> hi friend
[13:33:54] <decx> hm i cant fidn the project
[13:33:59] <decx> but i have something similar locally
[13:34:13] <robertmaxrees> decx that sounds more like tooltips to me.
[13:34:17] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/UOEcoaM.png
[13:34:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, those look like tooltips imo.
[13:34:48] <geri> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/15/ done...could you also show how to make it a template?
[13:34:49] <decx> it's dialog tho ^^
[13:35:10] <sharax> i need run function from each()
[13:35:13] <robertmaxrees> either way, that's a little different from 90% of modals :)
[13:35:17] <taplar> geri: your html inside a script is what I was referring to as a template
[13:35:35] <sharax> but!!! runing function after complet before function
[13:35:45] <sharax> There is a way?
[13:35:49] <robertmaxrees> sharax huh?
[13:35:52] <decx> true, might as well be flyouts directly under or over the button like tooltips
[13:36:31] <geri> taplar: i wonder if the current code can still be improved!?
[13:36:37] <sharax> my code: http://kopy.io/MQEFI
[13:36:59] <robertmaxrees> sharax you can do that.
[13:37:11] <robertmaxrees> though you don't need to pass index, element to that callback.
[13:38:02] <taplar> geri: i might recommend sticking the whole thing in an IIFE to scope the variables down
[13:38:04] <sharax> yea
[13:38:07] <sharax> But
[13:38:09] <sharax> High 100 runs concurrent requests.
[13:38:25] <decx> what's rezarib do
[13:38:32] <robertmaxrees> sharax do you mean rezarib is an ajax call?
[13:38:56] <geri> taplar: could you use a underscore template ?
[13:39:27] <taplar> i'm not familiar with underscore.  i know of it, never used it
[13:39:39] <robertmaxrees> underscore templates are pretty easy.
[13:39:40] <sharax> I need After the first operation. The second operation begins
[13:39:45] <sharax> rezarib code: http://kopy.io/QvUMd
[13:40:04] <robertmaxrees> sharax so you want to wait for the previous ajax call to finish before doing the next one?
[13:40:27] <geri> taplar: ok, could you just show how to put it in a IIFE to scope that example?
[13:40:29] <sharax> yea
[13:40:41] <geri> robertmaxrees: would it make sense in my example/
[13:40:42] <geri> ?
[13:40:50] <decx> change your endpoint to eat and output everything you need instead of piece by piece
[13:40:57] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:41:01] <decx> feed it an array of values
[13:41:07] <decx> and get everything you need bakc
[13:41:08] <taplar> geri: an IIFE is just: (function(){ /* your logic here */ }());
[13:41:09] <robertmaxrees> geri for what part?
[13:41:27] <taplar> it scopes the variables down to that function instead of being in the global scope
[13:41:28] <geri> robertmaxrees: for the dialog
[13:41:36] <robertmaxrees> geri you mean for var $dlg = $('<div id="dlg"></div>'); ?
[13:41:49] <geri> robertmaxrees: i would also pass the offset to the dialog and stuff
[13:42:03] <robertmaxrees> how many dialogs are you making?
[13:42:09] <robertmaxrees> or is it just this one?
[13:42:18] <geri> robertmaxrees: i would like to be flexible
[13:42:26] <robertmaxrees> geri that's not what i asked :)
[13:42:42] <geri> robertmaxrees: max 2
[13:42:53] <robertmaxrees> i can't recommend bringing in an entire other lib for templating if you're just doing a couple of these.
[13:42:56] <robertmaxrees> that's why that's relevant
[13:43:07] <robertmaxrees> unless the markup is REALLY complex, which I'm guessing it isn't.
[13:43:18] <robertmaxrees> since you should be using CSS for styling.
[13:48:30] <sharax> robertmaxrees A solution for me?
[13:48:40] <robertmaxrees> sharax decx gave you a great suggestion.
[13:50:39] <sharax> one use async: false ?!
[13:50:43] <robertmaxrees> never
[13:50:46] <robertmaxrees> don't lock the browser.
[13:50:52] <robertmaxrees> why not just send all data at once?
[13:50:56] <robertmaxrees> fix your server and all that.
[13:51:42] <taplar> geri: http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/19/ <-- added the IIFE, and got rid of the count and tmr variables
[13:53:15] <sharax> Post count is high.
[13:53:18] <sharax> Individually.
[13:53:19] <sharax>  More satisfied users keep
[13:53:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:53:37] <robertmaxrees> make an array of data and do it all at once.
[13:53:40] <geri> taplar: nice, looks much cleaner
[13:53:40] <robertmaxrees> that's what we're saying.
[13:54:18] <sharax> ok thanks
[13:54:24] <mmmveggies> $('.evil').destroy()
[13:56:26] <taplar> geri: another thing you should consider.  there isn't one in the fiddle but if the button already exists, or it has a preexisting parent element, you should delegate bind closer to it instead of off the document
[13:57:54] <geri> taplar: im not sure what you mean
[13:58:45] <taplar> $(document).on("click", "#btn", function() {
[13:58:57] <geri> taplar: yes?
[13:59:16] <taplar> that is going to evaluate every click in the document. it will ignore all but those for btn, but it still has to make that evaluation
[13:59:43] <taplar> if you can scope it down so that area the user is clicking is more relevant you can help it
[14:00:35] <geri> taplar: like $("#btn").click( function() ?
[14:00:48] <taplar> if it's a pre-existing element, sure
[14:01:08] <taplar> though stick with on()
[14:01:11] <geri> taplar: but its pre-exist in my case so i can do it?
[14:01:34] <taplar> yep.  do you understand the difference between on(event, handler) and on(event, selector, handler) ?
[14:03:05] <geri> taplar: no
[14:03:45] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:07:15] <nomoney4me> hi all, I have a website that I am trying to login using phantomjs.  I am wondering how I can send the log in information via post on jquery.  It doesnt seem to take me to the next page.
[14:07:19] <mmmveggies> taplar what's a good rule for where to delegate? The parent-most element of the component?
[14:07:37] <robertmaxrees> nomoney4me because $.post() is an ajax method.
[14:07:39] <robertmaxrees> not for normal forms.
[14:07:51] <taplar> mmmveggies: the closest pre-existing parent element
[14:08:14] <robertmaxrees> or the parent element for the "widget" you'r working with.
[14:08:17] <nomoney4me> oh, in that case, how would I simply do a form submit? $("form").submit(); ?
[14:08:18] <taplar> ^^^
[14:08:23] <robertmaxrees> nomoney4me yes.
[14:09:31] <mmmveggies> robertmaxrees that goes along with what I was thinking, certainly makes it easier to organize in my head
[14:09:36] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:09:47] <taplar> and when/if you remove that element, boom, binding gone
[14:10:48] <mmmveggies> out of sight as fast as a Black Lotus MTG card mistakingly put on ebay for $20
[14:11:06] <taplar> why you gotta pull the black card?
[14:11:37] <taplar> too edgy?
[14:11:39] * awkwardCough 
[14:12:02] <james_pulschen> hi everyone
[14:12:17] <taplar> aloha
[14:12:18] <awkwardCough> yo
[14:12:22] <robertmaxrees> soup
[14:12:37] <james_pulschen> i would like to ask for help regarding jqueryui im not sure if this is the right place
[14:12:38] <james_pulschen> is it
[14:12:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:12:43] <taplar> es
[14:12:48] <james_pulschen> nice thank you
[14:13:00] <james_pulschen> so i have log(ui.item ? "serverName :
[14:13:16] <james_pulschen> log( ui.item ? "serverName: " + ui.item.value + " description: " + ui.item.description..
[14:13:37] <james_pulschen> how do make it so that ui.item.value goes to the next line instead of one long line
[14:14:05] <taplar> put a \n in there
[14:14:05] <awkwardCough> \n
[14:14:08] <taplar> hush!
[14:14:08] <robertmaxrees> try console.table(ui.item) instead.
[14:14:27] <james_pulschen> \n didn't work, but rather it still displays all fields in one long line
[14:14:37] <decx> you dont need to concate in console
[14:14:44] <robertmaxrees> use console.table(ui.item) for a prettier output in this case.
[14:14:47] <decx> 'string', val, 'string' will do just fine
[14:15:11] <geri> taplar: ok, i plan to have multiple edits in my dialog. will i need to create for each input a form or is there a way to figure out which input changed?
[14:15:16] <james_pulschen> thank you robertmaxrees
[14:15:18] <taplar> i must apologize to awkwardCough.  i've been told that was insensative
[14:15:19] <james_pulschen> i will try that out
[14:15:41] <robertmaxrees> geri if each input is doing something different, i'd create a different binding for each.
[14:17:56] <james_pulschen> robert nothing is getting returned
[14:18:11] <robertmaxrees> james_pulschen wat
[14:18:13] <james_pulschen> this is my entire line
[14:18:17] <taplar> woah, that's pretty cool...
[14:18:19] <taplar> console.table([{name: 'me', title:'dope'}, {name:'you', title:'lame'}], ['name', 'title']);
[14:18:22] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[14:18:24] <james_pulschen> log( ui.item ? "serverName: " + ui.item.value + " description: " + ui.item.description + " os: " + ui.item.os + " ip: " + ui.item.ip : "not found, input was " + this.value );
[14:18:30] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:18:32] <geri> robertmaxrees: you mean like that? http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/22/
[14:18:39] <robertmaxrees> console.table(ui.item);
[14:19:24] <robertmaxrees> geri no - put those bindings outside of the button click handler.
[14:19:41] <robertmaxrees> you're again every time the button gets clicked.
[14:19:59] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener for the submit events.
[14:30:55] <geri> robertmaxrees: like that? http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/23/
[14:32:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd modify changeLevel2Clicked and changeLevel1Clicked to just take the clicked element directly and handle the event object for you.
[14:32:26] <robertmaxrees> but that's the basic idea.
[14:36:36] <geri> robertmaxrees: is that what you mean? http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/24/
[14:41:53] <robertmaxrees> i mean i'd make a single generic function that handles both cases and give them a shared class.
[14:58:17] <geri> robertmaxrees: than you use e.currentTarget.id to see which one is triggered?
[14:58:25] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[14:59:22] <robertmaxrees> are the IDs important for anything other than the level they're for?
[14:59:45] <apter> I created a select in an form with: $('<select>', {id: 'kommunevelger'}).appendTo('#formChoice'); Why dont this changeevent work: $('#kommunevelger').change(function (){ ?? Cant I listen to object that I create in jquery?
[15:00:01] <robertmaxrees> because the elemt doesn't exist when you do the binding.
[15:00:11] <robertmaxrees> you want a delegated listener apter
[15:00:44] <robertmaxrees> apter check out https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:01:11] <apter> robertmaxrees: That was what i was suspecting. Thanks for links! :)
[15:01:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:05:18] <apter> robertmaxrees: Strange. $('#kommunevelger').on('change', function(){  Still not work..
[15:05:32] <robertmaxrees> apter you didn't read the docs :)
[15:05:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not a delegated event listener.
[15:05:45] <apter> Ahh, will read again :D
[15:06:30] <taplar> lol
[15:06:37] <taplar> lmao
[15:06:40] <taplar> oh boy
[15:06:58] <taplar> "You didn't read the docs." - robertmaxrees 2006-2016
[15:06:59] <robertmaxrees> people jump to that first example every time hahaha
[15:07:08] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:09:16] <apter> robertmaxrees: There we go! :) *Note to self: read to the end next time*
[15:10:07] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:12:04] <pokergod> how do you or a condition when filtering?  type=checkbox||text  like .on('change','input[type=checkbox]', function(e)
[15:12:30] <robertmaxrees> just use input.
[15:12:42] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you can do any normal selector.
[15:12:50] <robertmaxrees> just like with CSS.
[15:13:08] <geri> robertmaxrees: was the following referred to me? are the IDs important for anything other than the level they're for?
[15:13:13] <robertmaxrees> geri yes.
[15:14:44] <geri> robertmaxrees: the form element exist already?
[15:15:18] <robertmaxrees> geri that's not what i asked :) i was going to suggest that you use a data attribute instead of those IDs if the IDs aren't being used to style them differently from one another or something like that.
[15:16:55] <geri> robertmaxrees: can you show in form of code?
[15:17:19] <robertmaxrees> which part are you confused by?
[15:18:25] <geri> robertmaxrees: i try to show you..one sec
[15:27:34] <geri> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/mx2sfpwf/25/ ... thats what i tried...
[15:27:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:29:11] <robertmaxrees> you're so close :) one sec.
[15:29:53] <robertmaxrees> something like http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mx2sfpwf/26/
[15:31:44] <geri> robertmaxrees: that gives me some error: Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type application/json:
[15:32:25] <robertmaxrees> did you even looka t my changes?
[15:32:32] <robertmaxrees> those wouldn't cause an error like that.
[15:33:14] <geri> robertmaxrees: yeah i saw line 10
[15:33:30] <robertmaxrees> i also changed the tempaltes.
[15:33:32] <robertmaxrees> *templates
[15:35:32] <geri> robertmaxrees: im not sure why you dont get an error running this jsfiddle
[15:35:59] <robertmaxrees> do you have an ajax call on your version?
[15:36:28] <geri> robertmaxrees: i dont use ajax here
[15:36:41] <robertmaxrees> then what's causing that error?  when does it happen?
[15:37:09] <geri> when i press the button, change the input and press enter
[15:37:27] <robertmaxrees> the error show show you a line number to the right,.
[15:37:31] <geri> after i press the button -> change the input and press enter
[15:37:55] <geri> robertmaxrees: it posts this message to the output: {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[15:38:06] <robertmaxrees> that's jsfiddle...
[15:38:15] <robertmaxrees> that's different from what your site will do.
[15:38:27] <geri> and no line number
[15:39:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mx2sfpwf/27/
[15:39:23] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy change.
[15:39:30] <robertmaxrees> just needed to update the templates, yo :)
[15:41:58] <ad0le> is there a way to do a selector for 2 data-items simultaneously : I've got something like <elem data-some-id1="0" data-some-id2="0" />. How can I used a selector to get this item on two separate attributes?
[15:42:13] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you should never use selectors for data attributes.
[15:43:12] <ad0le> why?
[15:43:29] <robertmaxrees> you can add/remove them without ever touching the DOM.
[15:43:46] <robertmaxrees> so you can't select them when using .data(), which is how you generally should be interacting with them.
[15:43:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest using .filter() for this instead.
[15:44:30] <geri> robertmaxrees: the way you read the id in line 63 seems wrong.
[15:45:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mx2sfpwf/28/
[15:45:20] <robertmaxrees> geri free help duder, just giving you the basic idea.
[15:45:33] <robertmaxrees> nothing is stopping you from trying on your own ;)
[15:50:35] <decx> i was thinking about these data lookups the other day, maybe pregenerate an object with all data attributes that come up in a collection and then have arrays with element references in there.
[15:50:59] <robertmaxrees> which is basically what jquery is doing under the hood in a roundabout way ;)
[15:51:01] <decx> so you can pregen.something to get a collection of references to all these elements
[15:51:24] <decx> elements with data-something that is
[15:51:37] <geri> robertmaxrees: i cannot find the data-id in the event struct
[15:52:06] <robertmaxrees> *object.
[15:52:11] <ad0le> niiice, chaining filters worked great
[15:52:14] <ad0le> thanks
[15:52:21] <robertmaxrees> ad0le you can give filter a function, too.
[15:52:22] <robertmaxrees> and use that.
[15:52:22] <decx> yeah in _data right. wish we could access that better
[15:52:26] <robertmaxrees> which is what i was expecting.
[15:52:30] <robertmaxrees> *suggesting.
[15:53:15] <robertmaxrees> geri javascript has objects, not structs.
[15:53:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mx2sfpwf/29/
[15:53:33] <robertmaxrees> bad var on my part.
[15:53:47] <robertmaxrees> easy tweaks - i was trying to give yopu the basic gist of the idea.
[15:53:54] <robertmaxrees> not solve the problem for you.
[15:56:39] <geri> robertmaxrees: i just wonder about data-id... dont we need to read data-id instead of id? $(e.currentTarget).data('id');
[15:56:46] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:56:50] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what that's doing?
[15:57:04] <robertmaxrees> .data('id') is how you read data-id on an element.
[15:58:39] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/
[15:58:48] <robertmaxrees> you could to e.target instead if it makes you feel better.
[16:03:59] <geri> robertmaxrees: ok thanks.

[17:56:34] <plamble> i cant get my browser to recognize my js (jquery) file for the life of me
[17:56:51] <plamble> index.html is defined in the root dir, the file is
[17:56:55] <plamble> root/scripts/main.js
[17:57:06] <plamble> at the base of my <head> i have
[17:57:07] <plamble> 	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[17:57:07] <plamble> 	<script src="scripts/main.js" type="javascript"></script>

[17:57:50] <mmmveggies> do you get a 404 in the console?
[17:58:01] <plamble> nope, nothing in the console
[17:58:06] <plamble> just blank
[17:58:13] <plamble> css files loaded just fine
[18:02:52] <plamble> i think its because my type is missing "text/"
[18:13:23] <arc_> plamble the default type for <script> is javascript so you don't actually need that at all
[18:16:56] <_bogus_> hi there.. I need in my form to have a field where the user can select images like a carousel (just like a carousel with some images, two arrows to prev and next image, and the picture active is the selected for the field)... I was thinking of a select.. isnt there any plugin to do something like this ?
[18:35:31] <mmmveggies> _bogus_ you could associate them with radio buttons if you want single-select and checkboxes if you want multi-select

[19:26:51] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[19:26:53] <robertmaxrees> $('.comp').each(Comp(this));
[19:27:04] <robertmaxrees> $('.comp').each(Comp); is what you want.
[19:27:16] <Sal> oh, ok, great
[19:27:18] <Sal> let me try
[19:27:29] <robertmaxrees> when you use that syntax, you don't pass any arguments.
[19:27:46] <robertmaxrees> unless you're generating functions and returning them.
[19:28:54] <Sal> robertmaxrees, but in this way, element of func Comp is undefined
[19:29:15] <Sal> i think i need to amke a little loop and pass each element to Comp
[19:29:26] <robertmaxrees> because jquery passes context to the function.
[19:29:32] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do this?
[19:30:06] <robertmaxrees> like, why are you using that kind of pattern here?
[19:30:14] <Sal> because the top var Comp is already defined and don't want to rewrite it
[19:30:26] <robertmaxrees> the constructor-esque pattern i mean.
[19:30:44] <Sal> this is only a small part of the entire thing, just wanted to pass each element to the func
[19:31:00] <Sal> i know, its strange, i wouldn't do it that way too
[19:31:06] <robertmaxrees> so then fix Comp.
[19:31:16] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll have to create an intermediary function to do what you want.
[19:31:29] <Sal> because i have coda in javascript
[19:31:44] <robertmaxrees> huh
[19:31:44] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:31:47] <Sal> and wanted to pass elements queried by jq
[19:31:58] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to create that intermediary.
[19:31:59] <Sal> coda=code
[19:32:24] <robertmaxrees> or rewrite that Comp thinger to work with JQ.
[19:32:51] <Sal> thats what i'm trying to do
[19:32:58] <Sal> i inserted the $('.comp').each(Comp());   part
[19:33:05] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i said to do.
[19:33:08] <robertmaxrees> you don't pass ()
[19:33:08] <Sal> just to call Comp on each element
[19:33:16] <robertmaxrees>  $('.comp').each(Comp);
[19:33:29] <Sal> fck!
[19:33:44] <Sal> sorry, didn't read well
[19:33:49] <Sal> let me try
[19:35:53] <Sal> no, not working
[19:35:56] <Sal> element = 0
[19:36:05] <robertmaxrees> you realize there is no this.element, right?
[19:36:16] <robertmaxrees> using each that way won't work because the context of the function is totally busted.
[19:36:21] <robertmaxrees> look into .bind()
[19:38:13] <Sal> in the first func, what shout "this" be?
[19:38:35] <robertmaxrees> you mean "what is 'this' in the first function"?
[19:38:59] <Sal> yes
[19:39:24] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/each/
[19:39:31] <robertmaxrees> the first paragraph of the docs tells you.
[19:39:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:39:43] <Sal> yes, but that not an each
[19:39:47] <Sal> its pure javascript
[19:39:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:39:58] <robertmaxrees> you're using each there buddy
[19:40:04] <robertmaxrees> that's a jquery method.
[19:40:28] <Sal> i want to know, if maybe you think that the main function COmp was maybe called by another functions that sets "this" in someway
[19:40:33] <Sal> no
[19:40:38] <Sal> forget about the last lines
[19:40:45] <Sal> i wrote them just to try something
[19:40:51] <robertmaxrees> then show me what you're actually using.
[19:40:56] <robertmaxrees> i don't play this game very well ;)
[19:40:59] <Sal> https://jsbin.com/mogiyaziha/edit?html,js,output
[19:41:04] <Sal> this is the real code
[19:41:07] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:41:21] <robertmaxrees> so `this` is a reference to the execution context basically.
[19:41:23] <Sal> at least the main structure
[19:41:29] <Sal> oh
[19:41:43] <Sal> so its.... window? document?
[19:41:49] <Sal> the DOM ?
[19:42:01] <robertmaxrees> "the dom" is an interface, never a context.
[19:42:07] <robertmaxrees> and that's impossible to answer for all instances.
[19:42:20] <Sal> its not the element or it wouldn't save the element in this.element
[19:42:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:43:08] <Sal> could this be the object prototype?
[19:43:27] <Sal> i mean the Comp prototype?
[19:43:27] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating context, objects, and protottypes.
[19:43:37] <robertmaxrees> this is a reference to the execution context.
[19:43:41] <randyr> Hey all, not sure if this is the right place, but anyway. I'm writing a tampermonkey script that is supposed to get all jpg,png,webm,gif from webpage, and put it in a zip. using $.get(url) i get xmlhttprequest cannot load, no access-control-allow-origin. Any idea how to get around this?
[19:43:45] <robertmaxrees> so in https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s2ehngt4/, it's what you want iut to be.
[19:43:58] <robertmaxrees> randyr sure, make your own server.
[19:44:07] <robertmaxrees> randyr you're running into CORS restrictions./
[19:44:20] <robertmaxrees> Sal https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
[19:44:38] <Sal> robertmaxrees, but 'foo' is just a string
[19:44:39] <randyr> I realize that, but is there a way to still load the media from the url?
[19:45:00] <robertmaxrees> randyr not without opening yourself up to a really bad vulnerabiliuty and let people access your bank account.
[19:45:07] <robertmaxrees> Sal that has nothing to do with what i said.
[19:45:14] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts.
[19:45:19] <randyr> It's not my website though, tampermonkey script.
[19:45:25] <robertmaxrees> randyr it doesn't matter.
[19:45:39] <robertmaxrees> your browser and that other server are protecting you from doing something dangerous.
[19:46:31] <Sal> robertmaxrees, ok, i got what you mean, but how can i let that object be executed on every <p> item of a page (for example) ?
[19:46:42] <robertmaxrees> Sal check out .bind()
[19:46:43] <arc_> robertmaxrees greasemonkey actually allows you to do this
[19:46:52] <Sal> bid is for events
[19:46:55] <robertmaxrees> arc_ (shrug) i'm just explaining the error.
[19:47:00] <robertmaxrees> Sal the native JS bind.
[19:47:06] <Sal> oh
[19:47:07] <arc_> randyr http://wiki.greasespot.net/GM_xmlhttpRequest this is what you need
[19:47:09] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[19:47:12] <Sal> damn, they're different?
[19:47:16] <robertmaxrees> very
[19:47:16] <Sal> didn't know that
[19:47:19] <Sal> i will, thanks
[19:47:20] <randyr> Ok thanks m8 ill look into it :)
[19:47:42] <robertmaxrees> since this isn't a tampermonkey/greasemonkey support channel i have no idea what they do or don't do :)
[19:47:54] <arc_> robertmaxrees i know, i just figured maybe you might want to know that for future reference ;)
[19:47:57] <robertmaxrees> there's a #greasemonkey though.
[19:48:01] <robertmaxrees> nah :)
[19:48:09] <robertmaxrees> people need to l2ReadTheDocs hahaha
[19:48:13] <arc_> heh
[19:48:15] <robertmaxrees> but thanks.
[19:48:35] <randyr> read em but im pretty new to javascript and webdev, so wasnt sure this was the right one.
[19:48:54] <randyr> Was actually looking at both xmlhttprequest and GM_download
[19:49:03] <robertmaxrees> so i guess the issue is you ask a question in the jquery channel, i'm going to assume you're asking in relation to jquery.
[19:49:15] <robertmaxrees> in which case: no - you cannot work around that.  hence my response.
[19:49:20] <randyr> fair enough
[19:49:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:53:20] <Sal> damn, this means also doing DOM find using js
[19:53:30] <robertmaxrees> Sal not at all.
[19:53:46] <robertmaxrees> .bind() and using the arguments passed via each is all you need.
[19:54:39] <Sal> reallY? let me try
[19:55:02] <robertmaxrees> so long as you use them correctly.
[19:55:21] <Sal> thats the problem
[19:55:22] <Sal> hehehe
[19:55:31] <Sal> because bind() is also jq
[19:56:09] <robertmaxrees> you don't use the jquery one.
[19:56:14] <robertmaxrees> you use the native one.
[19:56:25] <robertmaxrees> read the docs.  it's pretty simple.
[19:57:15] <_bogus_> if I have a plugin that initializes a container, and want to have a .next() and .prev() function, whats the best method to do this ?
[19:57:26] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:58:14] <robertmaxrees> _bogus_ you realize jq already has a next() and prev() right?
[19:58:23] <_bogus_> robertmaxrees, yes that was just an example
[19:58:32] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand your question at all :)
[19:58:40] <_bogus_> ill try to explain better
[19:58:47] <robertmaxrees> show some code maybe?
[19:59:32] <_bogus_> imagine its a carousel plugin , so you would like to append functions to the element, like, $(element).carousel , and then $(element).nextSlide() / .prevSlide() maybe.... ill post my actual code
[19:59:56] <robertmaxrees> so the jquery plugin guidelines will tell you to not to that actually.
[20:00:04] <robertmaxrees> minimize the footprint of your plugin and all that.
[20:00:15] <_bogus_> https://gist.github.com/andreycwb/20730af9c3f310a87fc1
[20:00:29] <_bogus_> there are functions .selNext() and .selPrev() that are not working now
[20:00:40] <_bogus_> but i guess you get the idea
[20:00:41] <robertmaxrees> is this something you wrote?
[20:00:46] <_bogus_> yes
[20:00:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you want to avoid doing it this way.
[20:01:11] <_bogus_> whats the best way to do it ?
[20:01:36] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#minimizing-plugin-footprint
[20:04:10] <_bogus_> hmm ok... got it... one more thing... im actually using a template for this plugin, but as the base.options are inside the $.imgselect function, how could I set it globally so I can use it under these next and prev functions?
[20:04:41] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[20:04:56] <robertmaxrees> your plugin shouldn't ever create global objects like that.
[20:05:13] <robertmaxrees> those would be scoped to the current method anyway sooo...
[20:06:39] <Sal> can i use $('p').each(Comp.bind(this));
[20:06:54] <_bogus_> how the plugins usually do this then?
[20:06:59] <robertmaxrees> Sal you *can*, but that's not what you want.
[20:07:06] <Sal> hehehe
[20:07:16] <robertmaxrees> think about what the context should be :)
[20:07:34] <Sal> love this game at 01:07 am
[20:07:36] <Sal> :)
[20:07:40] <Sal> let me think
[20:08:23] <Sal> $('p').each(function() { Comp.bind(this) });
[20:08:27] <Sal> what about that?
[20:08:29] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:08:41] <robertmaxrees> Comp.bind(Comp);
[20:08:43] <robertmaxrees> try that.
[20:09:05] <Sal> but, bid first element is this
[20:09:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:09:20] <Sal> fck, your'e right
[20:09:37] <robertmaxrees> but now you have another problem.
[20:10:04] <Sal> Comp.bind(Comp, this)
[20:10:08] <Sal> right?
[20:10:15] <Sal> to have the element passed
[20:10:26] <robertmaxrees> lol except `this` won't be what you want it to be there.
[20:10:35] <robertmaxrees> hence the intermediary function i was talking about earlier.
[20:10:43] <Sal> $(this) ?
[20:10:47] <robertmaxrees> dude
[20:10:47] <Sal> hehehe
[20:10:52] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:11:11] <Sal> damok, wait, let me read more
[20:11:13] <Sal> don't tell me
[20:15:24] <_bogus_> robertmaxrees, cant I set var base outside $.imgselect function so I can use it by other functions? Or how the plugins usually do with other functions like next/prev ?
[20:15:47] <robertmaxrees> _bogus_ literally my entire point is that they don't do other functions at all.
[20:15:50] <robertmaxrees> it's a really bad idea.
[20:16:06] <robertmaxrees> because now you're potentially stomping over other methods.
[20:16:25] <_bogus_> I see... can I set a internal method so? like $(element).imgselect.next() ?
[20:16:52] <robertmaxrees> sure, or pass a string like imgSelect('next');
[20:17:40] <_bogus_> ok ill try that here, thanks!
[20:19:59] <Sal> robertmaxrees, i give up. is it that hard to do?
[20:20:26] <robertmaxrees> it's more that it's not all that intuitive.
[20:20:29] <Sal> i also tried callign a function inside each that calls Comp.bind
[20:20:40] <robertmaxrees> right.  and you have to pass the element from there, as well.
[20:20:48] <robertmaxrees> it's really awkward.
[20:21:12] <robertmaxrees> Comp.bind(comp, this); from within that other function.
[20:21:28] <Sal> http://img03.imgland.net/WiTff1.png
[20:21:44] <robertmaxrees> something like that, sure.
[20:21:52] <Sal> oh, comp lower case first letter?
[20:21:57] <Sal> it's not working
[20:22:00] <robertmaxrees> upper.
[20:22:03] <Sal> it doesn't even call the COmp
[20:22:07] <Sal> i'm debugging it
[20:22:17] <Sal> i have a break inside it
[20:22:22] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[20:22:49] <Sal> http://img03.imgland.net/SLfONFE.png
[20:22:56] <robertmaxrees> not in a screenshot, yo.
[20:23:11] <Sal> i don't have it in an online playground, because i don't know how to debug it
[20:23:20] <Sal> but ill write it
[20:23:21] <Sal> wait
[20:23:43] <robertmaxrees> just use what you have iun that screenshot.
[20:23:46] <robertmaxrees> that's plenty.
[20:23:59] <Sal> https://jsbin.com/mogiyaziha/edit?html,js,output
[20:25:17] <Sal> i also keep getting that init is not a function
[20:25:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:25:36] <Sal> maybe its an old error, but i have a console.log in there that doesn't show
[20:25:57] <Sal> did i make any mistake?
[20:25:58] <robertmaxrees> right, so .bind() returns a new function with that context.  it doesn't run anything.
[20:26:05] <robertmaxrees> since you didn't actually read the docs ;)
[20:26:10] <Sal> hehehe
[20:26:17] <Sal> sorry
[20:26:48] <robertmaxrees> is this actually what that function looks like?
[20:27:18] <Sal> no, its only the structure
[20:27:35] <Sal> its a main var func and then a lot of prototype funcs
[20:27:55] <Sal> so i just got the struct of 2 of them to try to get into it
[20:28:06] <robertmaxrees> fwiw js doesn't have structs.
[20:28:19] <Sal> oh, you know what i mean
[20:28:27] <robertmaxrees> still an important distinction ;)
[20:28:39] <Sal> i meant the syntax of var Comp and Comp.prototype
[20:28:46] <Sal> yes, yes
[20:29:08] <Sal> https://jsbin.com/mogiyaziha/edit?html,js,output
[20:29:15] <robertmaxrees> stop for a second.
[20:29:23] <Sal> hehehe
[20:29:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f7j86j5d/
[20:30:20] <robertmaxrees> something like this should work.
[20:30:54] <barbie> How can I fix this JSON QUERY ? https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/394c9287e4ffa2c1c0d4
[20:31:05] <robertmaxrees> barbie what's the issue?
[20:31:14] <barbie> The problem is that I want to get synonym from the json. However, the spot synonym changes
[20:31:33] <robertmaxrees> use .filter()
[20:32:13] <barbie> ok, ill check it out
[20:32:21] <Sal> hey! wait a second! that not fair! where's the bind() ??
[20:32:28] <robertmaxrees> Sal read the docs, yo.
[20:32:33] <robertmaxrees> this is all explained.
[20:32:50] <robertmaxrees> you needed .call() in your case, but it's all under function context.
[20:34:15] <robertmaxrees> barbie https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pet7r81x/1/
[20:35:57] <Sal> robertmaxrees, can the body of the function myIntermediary be put inside the each?
[20:36:09] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[20:36:21] <robertmaxrees> make things easier to read.
[20:36:29] <Sal> because wont it be reapeted on other components liek that?
[20:36:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:36:39] <Sal> i mean, aint it public?
[20:36:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:37:01] <robertmaxrees> it's scoped to that current iife.
[20:37:03] <robertmaxrees> or should be, at least.
[20:37:39] <Sal> but aint myIntermediary public?
[20:38:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:38:04] <robertmaxrees> it's scoped to that IIFE duder.
[20:38:20] <Sal> ok, let me try m,aking another Comp2
[20:40:24] <Sal> robertmaxrees, great work, thanks
[20:40:27] <Sal> its working
[20:40:33] <robertmaxrees> get the idea?
[20:40:39] <Sal> yep, got it
[20:41:06] <robertmaxrees> 'kay - 'cause it's not "good work", it's "thanbks for the help" ;)
[20:41:30] <Sal> yes,
[20:41:36] <Sal> thanks for the help
[20:42:55] <Sal> anyway... one more question... are javascript elements got with getElementByID or whatever, simply html text?
[20:43:00] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:43:05] <robertmaxrees> they're DOM nodes.
[20:43:06] <barbie> @robertmaxrees thanks that basically is what I want
[20:43:10] <Sal> i jquery they are abjects witha  bunch of stuff
[20:43:26] <robertmaxrees> Sal and DOM methods do similar things.
[20:43:57] <Sal> let me try a pure js getElement to see what it returns
[20:44:05] <robertmaxrees> a DOM node.
[20:44:17] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById
[20:44:26] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element
[20:47:59] <Sal> ok, thanks again
[20:48:04] <Sal> it returns the same stuff
[20:48:06] <Sal> thanks
[20:48:11] <robertmaxrees> not as a jquery object.
[20:48:21] <barbie> im confused whats going on with the data
[20:48:28] <Sal> right, simply the dom node
[20:48:30] <barbie> is it an array? or a giant string?
[20:48:38] <robertmaxrees> barbie you have an array there.
[20:48:43] <Sal> night
[20:48:57] <barbie> Thats what I though, but I am seem to be unable to split it
[20:49:28] <robertmaxrees> try to typeof against the data.
[20:50:13] <i8igmac> im trying to stream data to the client browser, i can successfully append new data to a <div id="refresh">
[20:50:19] <i8igmac> but its like a never ending loop,
[20:50:47] <robertmaxrees> i8igmac show us what you're doing.
[20:51:58] <barbie> object
[20:52:11] <robertmaxrees> barbie then show us what you're trying to do.
[20:52:13] <robertmaxrees> show the code :)
[20:52:20] <robertmaxrees> becuase i'm getting the feeling you're doing something wrong.
[20:52:54] <i8igmac> http://pastebin.com/JABgJEpi
[20:54:05] <i8igmac> with that example, i hope to simply stream One time, Time.now to the client...
[20:54:37] <barbie> I got it now: $('#wordnikSynonyms').append("<li>"+synonyms[0].words.join(' ')+"</li>") Thats basically what I want. The only problem is that its one giant li. Whats the best way to parse each word out into an li? a split with a 'for' loop?
[20:54:49] <robertmaxrees> barbie .map()
[20:55:26] <robertmaxrees> i8igmac check out http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/
[20:56:13] <i8igmac> thank you ill check it out
[21:05:38] <barbie> robertmaxrees : i couldnt figure out the .map() so i just used a loop: https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/580c47008fc4218a52a5
[21:05:40] <barbie> thanks !
[21:06:11] <jackp10> Hi everyone
[21:06:51] <barbie> any of you guys ever use masonry before?
[21:21:56] <barbie> Hey, how can i make this toggleable? $( this ).height( "auto" ) ?
[21:22:13] <barbie> the problem is that I need the height to go back to normal after a div is clicked
[21:27:13] <i8igmac> with server sent events, would it be hacky if i have the client browser wait for "data: kill_stream" to source.close();
[21:59:51] <syntaks> hey folks
[22:00:21] <syntaks> i'm trying to shift a div into another on-click using appendTo, but on-click it's not quite working out that way
[22:00:27] <syntaks> is there an updated/better method for this?
[22:15:17] <jackp10> Can someone explain to me how come that those two pages act differently during mouseover event on a cell ?
[22:15:23] <jackp10> http://www.alessandrodemarco.net/test.html
[22:15:32] <jackp10> https://jsfiddle.net/qj54bLvp/
[22:16:16] <jackp10> basically, onmouseover, both of them expand the cell, but when you right click on it, the jsfiddle keep the cell width the same, weather the first link loses the mouseover
[22:22:10] <easyOnMe> is this a correct jquery call: $(".red, .blue, .orange").draggle(); to make the red blue and orange classes draggle
[22:33:27] * spoonUltra coughs
[23:10:01] <z1haze> can someone help me out with this grid plugin? http://testlist.hendricksweb.com/admin if you move to grid items on the right side over to the left size, (the votes today item, an the website traffic item), the parent container resizes a little bit and wont let me move the items back.. i dont know why this is happening
[23:16:15] <scorphus> How do I mock a UDP connection – i.e.  conn, err := net.Dial("udp", address)  – in a way I can  _, err = conn.Write(b)  just to check it was called and with which arguments?
