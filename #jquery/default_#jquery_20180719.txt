[05:25:07] <Lenswipee> hi, is it possible in the ajax call back function to trigger a page refresh?
[05:28:33] <Cork> window.location.reload();
[05:29:19] <Lenswipee> Cork: hi, so it must be done on the client-side?
[05:29:58] <Cork> well the client makes an ajax call
[05:34:28] <Lenswipee> Cork: which is better to use and why? a) window.location.href = ... or window.location.reload();
[05:34:54] <Triffid_Hunter> Lenswipee: well do you want to reload or go to another url?
[05:35:20] <Cork> window.location = window.location; window.location.href = window.location.href; window.location.reload();
[05:35:24] <Cork> are all the same
[05:36:03] <Lenswipee> window.location.href = window.location.href;
[05:36:08] <Lenswipee> ?
[05:36:17] <Lenswipee> window.location = window.location
[05:36:19] <Lenswipee> ?
[05:36:40] <Cork> what?
[05:36:46] <Lenswipee> Triffid_Hunter: reload page
[05:37:05] <Lenswipee> Cork: what? = what?
[05:37:10] <Lenswipee> Cork: helpful?
[05:37:22] <Triffid_Hunter> Lenswipee: then use reload..
[05:37:24] <Cork> you can use any of them
[05:37:45] <Cork> but ya, .reload() is to reload so...
[05:38:33] <Lenswipee> Cork: Seems unreliable as sometimes it doesn't redirect or reload the page stays the same. other times it will redirect/reload.
[05:38:50] <Cork> uh...
[05:38:57] <Cork> reload != redirect...
[05:39:33] <Lenswipee> window.location.href redirects
[05:39:40] <Cork> they are actually explicitly the opposite
[05:39:44] <Cork> no it isn't
[05:40:15] <Cork> window.location = and window.location.href = is setting a new location to load
[05:40:25] <Lenswipee> it redirects the current page to another page
[05:40:36] <Cork> redirect are explicitly when the server sets a location header
[05:40:50] <Cork> and you can't do that with ajax
[05:40:59] <Cork> as it isn't a full page load
[05:42:36] <Lenswipee> my point is when i create a timer that counts down from 3mins it doesn't always sets "a new location to load".
[05:42:51] <Lenswipee> so it seems unreliable
[05:43:54] <Lenswipee> does anyone know why this is happening?
[05:44:54] <Cork> "unreliable"?
[05:45:27] <Lenswipee> yes unreliable
[05:46:06] <Cork> .reload() reloads the current url in the browser
[05:46:35] <Cork> same with setting the same with window.location or window.location.href
[05:46:39] <Lenswipee> Cork: are you ok?
[05:47:08] <Cork> sure
[05:47:42] <Uhkis> :D
[05:48:09] <Lenswipee> Cork: You seem off your game today,
[05:49:00] <Cork> if reloading from javascript doesn't load what you expect you need to check what the server sends
[05:50:16] <Lenswipee> Cork: I'm not going to repeat myself again.
[05:51:10] <Cork> Lenswipee: redirect is when you load an url and the server sends that the client should load another url instead
[05:51:38] <Cork> reload is when the client should reload the same url it is currently on
[05:52:23] <Lenswipee> Cork: Have a good day.
[05:52:32] <Cork> so window.location.reload() reloads the same url the browser is currently on
[05:52:48] <Cork> and the server can redirect that if it wants
[05:53:22] <Cork> i'm not sure what it is you're confused about...
[05:53:26] <Lenswipee> OK Corky
[07:05:19] <ryan_ford> whew why so adversarial when you're asking for help?
[07:31:37] <Cork> well it is normally there problem
[07:31:59] <Cork> when you're asking for help you usually have to accept the job of getting the one you ask for help to understand what you have problem with
[07:32:07] <Cork> if you don't well, it is your loss
[07:41:42] <ryan_ford> i had to read what you said a couple times too. i think some strategic quotes could have helped
[07:42:29] <Cork> ya, it was stright before lunch and i was knee deep in debugging test failuers...
[07:42:38] <Cork> not the most clear spoken moments :)
[07:44:50] <ryan_ford> i think my not writing tests is even more criminal because I know I *should* be writing them ðŸ™ˆ
[07:44:56] <ryan_ford> can't claim ignorance, I know better
[07:45:04] <Cork> lol
[13:51:48] <name_is_nick> hello! i retrieve an object and append dynamically created elements to it, but the content is added as text, what do?
[13:52:30] <robertmaxrees> show us?
[13:52:53] <name_is_nick> one moment please
[13:54:15] <name_is_nick> https://pastebin.com/R4zhD8yA
[13:54:45] <robertmaxrees> unrelated, but don't use $.each() with jquery selections.
[13:54:47] <name_is_nick> thats were everything gets created and fetch
[13:54:52] <name_is_nick> why?
[13:54:59] <name_is_nick> i thought that is it's purpose
[13:55:03] <robertmaxrees> $('.bzOpening').each() is what you want.
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> where's the fetch?
[13:55:17] <name_is_nick> k thanks
[13:55:26] <name_is_nick> 'fetch'
[13:55:34] <name_is_nick> i get the items is what i mean
[13:55:43] <robertmaxrees> where?
[13:55:53] <name_is_nick>  $(item).find('.bzDepartment span')[0].innerText
[13:55:56] <name_is_nick> for example
[13:56:09] <robertmaxrees> why not just use .text()
[13:56:11] <robertmaxrees> >
[13:56:11] <name_is_nick> it's malformed content that should dynamically be recreated
[13:56:12] <robertmaxrees> &?
[13:56:40] <name_is_nick> instead of innerText? i don't know looked correct to me, can change it
[13:57:01] <robertmaxrees> there's a lot of weird juggling happening here.
[13:57:16] <robertmaxrees> $(item).find('h2')[0].innerText should be $(item).find('h2').text();
[13:57:33] <robertmaxrees> $($(item).find('a')[0]).attr('onclick') can be $(item).find('a').attr('onclick')
[13:57:49] <robertmaxrees> let container = $('#grid-2')[0]; doesn't need the [0] on it
[13:58:02] <robertmaxrees> you're basically converting down to raw DOM a whole bunmch for no real reason.
[13:58:14] <name_is_nick> yeah i'm new to web development
[13:58:31] <robertmaxrees> that's fine :)
[13:58:35] <robertmaxrees> just letting you know.
[13:58:46] <name_is_nick> thanks, appreciate it
[13:59:17] <markh> @robertmaxrees +++
[13:59:19] <robertmaxrees> also:
[13:59:25] <name_is_nick> is it possible that dynamic content can be disabled?
[13:59:26] <robertmaxrees> "<a href='#' onclick='" + onclick_ref + "'>" +
[13:59:39] <robertmaxrees> onclick is a bad idea fwiw.
[14:00:10] <name_is_nick> yes, but the content i'm replacing with the dynamic content has a onclick function
[14:00:33] <robertmaxrees> is the onclick calling a named function?
[14:00:45] <name_is_nick> yes
[14:01:02] <robertmaxrees> then just call the function directly.
[14:01:05] <robertmaxrees> using js.
[14:01:41] <name_is_nick> it's a named function that gets injected externally :(
[14:01:46] <robertmaxrees> $('#grid-2').on('click', '.portolio-item a', theFunctionNameHere);
[14:01:48] <name_is_nick> it may change
[14:01:48] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[14:01:53] <robertmaxrees> wait what.
[14:02:09] <name_is_nick> sounds bad, is bad
[14:02:12] <robertmaxrees> then how do you know the name ahead of time?
[14:02:35] <robertmaxrees> or is the markup you're replacing all dynamically generated?
[14:02:59] <name_is_nick> yes
[14:03:53] <name_is_nick> as i said it is currently fixed but it may change, so i can't fumble with it
[14:03:55] <robertmaxrees> where is it coming from?
[14:04:05] <robertmaxrees> because something seems funky.
[14:05:03] <name_is_nick> no it's okay it's just badly written
[14:05:45] <name_is_nick> does it matter that the code is first executed at window.onload ?
[14:05:53] <robertmaxrees> it can.
[14:07:01] <name_is_nick>          $('.bzOpening').hide(); doesn't work either
[14:07:38] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('.bzOpening').length); right before where you try to do the hide
[14:07:44] <robertmaxrees> what do you see in your console?
[14:09:17] <name_is_nick> ah my bad, typo, hiding works.. now the mystery of the not accepted dynamic content remains
[14:09:31] <robertmaxrees> "not accepted dynamic content"?
[14:11:08] <name_is_nick> wait, sorry it worked now
[14:11:20] <name_is_nick> thanks bro, appreciate the coding style tips
[14:11:41] <robertmaxrees> heh, that's less "coding style" and more "how to use jquery" :)
[14:12:42] <name_is_nick> :)
[14:57:31] <sunrunner20> I feel stupid but why isn't this working? https://jsfiddle.net/sunrunner20/pvLgc2u9/
[14:58:33] <robertmaxrees> var input = this.children('input');
[14:58:39] <robertmaxrees> 'this' is the raw dom node.
[14:58:44] <robertmaxrees> you want $(this).children('input');
[14:58:51] <robertmaxrees> but also
[14:59:04] <robertmaxrees> you don't need this js at all :)
[14:59:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pvLgc2u9/3/ sunrunner20
[15:01:22] <sunrunner20> wtf
[15:01:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:01:37] <robertmaxrees> use labels
[15:01:44] <sunrunner20> how does wrapping it in a label make the button click the checkbox?
[15:02:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pvLgc2u9/5/ this is actually safer
[15:02:26] <robertmaxrees> aaaand that's how labels work.
[15:02:34] <taplar> +++
[15:02:43] <robertmaxrees> you can either use the label's for attribute, or just wrap stuff.
[15:08:47] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:25:45] <sunrunner20> thx
[15:55:10] <darkhanb> I wonder if there is a special function for this: $elem.filter('[data-foo="bar"]')
[15:55:50] <darkhanb> something like: $elem.filter("[data-foo]").filterValue("bar")
[16:54:58] <ertl> Hello, I'm using $('#data'+knext).css({'background-color' : '#CD5555'}); to set the background color of an input box in case of error and back to #FFFFFF when the error is fixed; it used to work for several months, but since a couple of days I was notified that on a FF 64bit installation, the text inserted in the input box becomes not visible, when background-color is set back to white... any hint? Thanks
[16:56:34] <robertmaxrees> ertl have a fiddle?
[16:59:00] <ertl> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/8grhvsq6/ ... please don't be scared for that ugly code...
[16:59:45] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:59:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:59:58] <robertmaxrees> i mean of the actual bug in action, sorry.,
[17:01:44] <ertl> robertmaxrees: I can't share it, I'm sorry... the weird thing is that if I change the color from #FFFFFF to anything else, the text inserted is still there, with #FFFFFF it becomes not visible...
[17:01:56] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:02:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8grhvsq6/4/
[17:02:15] <robertmaxrees> i mean something like this.
[17:02:20] <robertmaxrees> a minimal test case.
[17:04:24] <robertmaxrees> ertl so what does my fiddle not have that your page does?
[17:09:14] <ertl> robertmaxrees: well, I have a <select> with <option> fields, when I change the value of that <select> the input field should change the background-color, according to value inserted
[17:09:26] <robertmaxrees> so it's not an input?
[17:09:32] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:09:46] <robertmaxrees> so said earlier that the bug happens when you sewt the background-color to white.
[17:09:47] <ertl> robertmaxrees: I have a <select> AND an input, sorry
[17:09:50] <robertmaxrees> #ffffff
[17:09:58] <robertmaxrees> did you mean the background-color of the input?
[17:10:08] <ertl> Yes
[17:10:13] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:10:19] <robertmaxrees> so my fiddle shows that is not the issue.
[17:10:42] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you comment out the .css() calls in your code?
[17:10:50] <ertl> But if I comment out that only line of code it works as expected
[17:11:07] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[17:11:32] <ertl> src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"
[17:12:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8grhvsq6/6/
[17:12:21] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:12:24] <robertmaxrees> so that's not the issue.
[17:12:40] <robertmaxrees> are there any other libraries/frameworks?
[17:13:52] <ertl> No, just PHP, HTML and jquery
[17:13:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[18:09:32] * taplar also likes C&C music factory
[18:11:30] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[18:14:43] <taplar> !!!!  robby rob, break it down!
[18:15:32] <robertmaxrees> oontz oontz oontz
[22:34:02] <jak2000> any Qr plugin? that recommend me?
[23:47:52] <ryan_ford> which are you considering?
