[05:54:02] <codectter> The cursor option does not work either `cursor:"move"` - move cursor just dosn't show at all. https://pastebin.com/2hght1z8
[05:54:07] <codectter> jquery-ui
[05:54:12] <codectter> draggable
[05:57:02] <Cork> codectter: try making a jsfiddle showing the example
[05:57:16] <Cork> *problem
[05:57:18] <codectter> 2secs
[06:02:13] <undefined_bob> hee Cork I would just like to know, if are you alright and healthy? :)
[06:02:31] <Cork> undefined_bob: so far, sure
[06:02:46] <undefined_bob> glad to hear that
[06:08:44] <codectter> Cork: i've set the cursor to move but does not show when I hover over the image (shows only on image drag), I should be able to move the img up/down with mouse gesture setting scroll to true is not working https://jsfiddle.net/1da2yhj6/
[06:17:58] <codectter> actually move cursor is not shown when element is dragged on my actually code
[06:18:10] <codectter> seems show on the fiddle
[06:18:57] <codectter> which is probably the correct behaviour
[06:20:17] <codectter> yes, cursor move would show when element is dragged, which it does on the fiddle.
[06:43:13] <Cork> codectter: remember that what you drag normally isn't the original element you drag clone with a overlay class (don't remmeber the name)
[06:43:28] <Cork> so your css might break the styling there
[06:44:07] <codectter> how do i add cursor move to what ever i'm dragging?
[06:44:19] <codectter> scroll is not working either
[06:44:56] <Cork> not without an example where the problem is shoing
[06:45:01] <Cork> *showing
[06:45:05] <codectter> tried adding css to drag handle but this does not always work  .ui-draggable-handle{cursor: move;}
[06:45:37] <Cork> best option is prob to create a clone of the problematic page and reduce it until the problem goes away
[06:46:28] <Cork> then you have either the answer or something to base an answer on
[06:46:51] <codectter> i have 'scroll: true,' but when scroll up/down nothing happens (see fiddle above)
[06:48:15] <Cork> codectter: if you check the documentation scroll: false is the onlything that will do anything as true is the default
[06:48:35] <codectter> when why is it not working?
[06:49:15] <codectter> try scrolling up/down
[06:49:22] <codectter> nothing happens
[06:49:30] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/k7fx45zw/
[06:49:37] <Cork> you can't scroll overflow: hidden
[06:50:45] <codectter> i was refering to the image not the document
[06:51:15] <codectter> removed overflow prop
[06:51:40] <codectter> image should move just as if I was clicking on img and moving up/down
[06:52:48] <codectter> if you're on facebook try adding a cover to your profile page and reposition it with your mouse by moving it up/down
[06:53:03] <codectter> thats the type of behaviour i'm looking for.
[06:53:07] <codectter> on desktop
[06:53:29] <codectter> moving cursor*
[06:53:43] <Cork> you mean the image sould stick to the cursor when you let go or what?
[06:53:56] <codectter> Cork!
[06:54:02] <Cork> cause it scrolls just fine with me, except for the problem that the image is too big
[06:54:24] <codectter> you mean you can see the bottom of the image?
[06:54:30] <codectter> when you scroll down?
[06:54:42] <codectter> image not docu
[06:54:43] <Cork> not with the image you used as it is bigger then the container
[06:54:55] <Cork> but with a sensible one; sure
[06:55:12] <codectter> thats why i'm using draggable widget to position the image within the container
[06:55:32] <codectter> position part that I want in the container
[06:55:55] <Cork> not really possible when it is several times bigger then the container
[06:56:14] <codectter> click on the image and move it up and down
[06:56:26] <Cork> ya, sure you can move it
[06:56:42] <Cork> but you can't get it all inside as, like i sad it is like 6-7 times taller
[06:57:10] <Cork> this works just fine for me https://jsfiddle.net/k7fx45zw/1
[06:58:11] <codectter> you missed my point. I don't want all of it inside, I just want to be able to select the part of the image that I want to show in the container and crop the rest
[06:58:50] <codectter> draggable allows me to do this my clicking on the image and moving it up/down
[06:59:46] <codectter> i just want to be able to position the image using mouse cursor in addition to clicking on the img and moving it.
[07:00:41] <Cork> i have no clue what you mean by that
[07:00:54] <Cork> move it by dragging sure, but by not dragging you want to move it?!?
[07:01:30] <codectter> mouse cursor would act like the 'click'
[07:01:49] <Cork> what?
[07:02:10] <codectter> so when I click on the image i able to move it up/down
[07:02:20] <Cork> ya, dragging sure
[07:04:05] <codectter> instead of clicking on the image, I want to be. able to drag the image with a mouse cursor, e.g. when i'm hovering over the container, and on my laptop touchpad gesture upward it woud drag the img upwards
[07:04:09] <codectter> make ense?
[07:04:24] <codectter> sense*
[07:05:25] <Cork> are you talking about createing a looking glass effect?
[07:05:37] <codectter> brb
[07:05:39] <Cork> cause else i have no cluse what you mean
[07:05:57] <codectter> are you on facebook?
[07:06:13] <codectter> try the adding a cover photo to your profile
[07:07:17] <codectter> you should be able to reposition the image with your laptop's touchpad alone
[07:07:31] <codectter> e.g. gesturing up/down
[07:09:16] <codectter> nvm
[07:10:22] <codectter> i misunderstood what the purpose of scroll prop is
[07:10:27] <codectter> my bad
[07:38:55] <codectter> Cork: still can't find a fix to show cursor move when the drag is active
[07:39:52] <codectter> [11:45:17]  <codectter> tried adding css to drag handle but this does not always work  .ui-draggable-handle{cursor: move;}
[07:40:23] <Cork> codectter: well check your css
[07:40:32] <Cork> someting is forcing the standard cursor
[07:41:16] <codectter> it works when it wants to
[07:42:44] <Cork> codectter: the cursor is set on body
[07:43:00] <Cork> so if you force cursor somewhere it will override it
[07:45:05] <Cork> simplest option is prob to bind dragstart and dragend and set a class on body when it happens
[07:45:22] <Cork> and force the cursor with an !important when that happens
[10:19:20] <gnstaxo> Hi. Does somebody have a script to show a full image when you click on its thumbnail (which is another file)?. This approach is from 4chan
[10:44:45] <monk12> Hey all, one of our websites wasnt working so did a tiny bit of research.  A jquery file on https://code.jquery.com was being blocked by our enterprise network firewall. Looks like one of the certs up the chain is expired?  https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=https://code.jquery.com
[10:46:08] <monk12> That SSLHopper link says it expired 4 days ago. Wasnt sure if thats something to alert people on jquery (or since the issue is higher up on the chain, then someone really at Comodo/Sectigo should to be notified)..
[10:48:30] <monk12> Note: When viewing the url in Chrome, (and then viewing the Cert in Chrome), the 2 higher up chains look fine (not expired). But the network-security guy said SSL Hopper site looks more accurate since the firewall did block because it said the cert expired.
[10:48:44] <monk12> Anyway just thought I'd alert people in case its a jquery.com issue to fix. Thanks.
[10:49:44] <monk12> For now, we are whitelisting the one jquery.com domain to 'solve' the issue for our users.
[10:54:53] <taplar> monk12 users were reporting this yesterday.  If the issue is on going they may not have resolved it yet.  Opening a github issue would most likely be a faster way of bringing it to the developers attention.
[10:55:34] <taplar> The usage of the google CDN for the resource also work, however everyone should always make the consideration, that if a library is critical for their application, that perhaps they should host it locally.
[10:57:44] <taplar> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/59  There is actually an open issue already
[10:58:07] <monk12> Thats true. My own applications have local jquery/angular/etc dependencies and are working. I'll recommend to the makers of our 3rd party applications to maybe do the same in the future.
[11:09:54] <monk12> taplar: Thanks for the headsup.
[11:10:02] <taplar> yup yup
[13:23:45] <gnstaxo> Hi. Does somebody have a script to show a full image when you click on its thumbnail (which is another file)?. This approach is from 4chan
[13:24:40] <gnstaxo> This effect occurs in the same page
[14:06:09] <bRi-> Jquery Autocompletion: Is there any option to set this from onchange to onkeypress?
[14:34:42] <gnstaxo> How do I get the parent of a element when I click on it?
[14:34:53] <taplar> $(this).parent()
[14:34:55] <gnstaxo> an*
[14:34:59] <taplar> or this.parentNode
[15:16:28] <gnstaxo> how do i send an ajax request when i press a button?
[15:17:00] <taplar> https://learn.jquery.com/events/   https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[17:48:16] <RM982> when you add elements with html(), they are automatically added to the DOM right?
[17:49:52] <RM982> Because I'm adding some radio inputs but later I select them and $('.my-radio').on('change', function() { ... is not triggered
[18:03:51] <Hoppelhase> RM982: I think .html() just sets HTML code, not actual elements. You want to read about jQuery's delegated event handlers
[18:13:05] <RM982> will do thanks
[19:03:17] <RM982> Hoppelhase I think that's deprecated
[19:03:39] <sydbarret> hi
[19:03:48] <sydbarret> anybody awake?
[19:04:17] <Hoppelhase> RM982: What is deprecated?
[19:06:41] <RM982> I mean, that you don't need to care about event handlers anymore, if I understand correctly they are currently automatically attached with the .on() method
[19:07:10] <sydbarret> i have 3 different a links. I wanna change the iframe src when clicking on those links
[19:07:51] <Hoppelhase> RM982: But not for elements that don't already exist in the DOM
[19:08:33] <RM982> ahh I see
[19:10:12] <RM982> perfect, it's working now
[19:10:14] <RM982> $('body').delegate('input[type=radio]', 'change', function() {
[19:10:21] <RM982> thanks a lot
[19:10:37] <RM982> Hoppelhase
[19:11:06] <Hoppelhase> No problem :)
[19:14:18] <Hoppelhase> RM982: Btw, .delegate() actually seems to be deprecated. You'd use $('body').on ('change', 'input[type=radio]', function() { ... }) instead :p
[19:15:50] <RM982> perfect
[19:23:32] <sydbarret> im getting file  not found
[19:23:34] <sydbarret>  $("#if1").attr('src', '/static/img/dentist_free_dentist_clinic_near_me_desktop_5ec9b313b1c8785d02d075d1.png');
[19:25:21] <sydbarret> sorry misspelled file
[19:32:22] <sydbarret> is there a way to check in  $("a").click(function(e) {
[19:32:29] <sydbarret> which a link was clicked?
[19:36:42] <RM982> you can reference the clicked link with the 'this' selector
[19:37:23] <sydbarret> i think i rather put an id to each one of then
[19:37:44] <sydbarret> and then make $("#a1").click(function(e) { for ech one of then innit
[19:38:24] <RM982> Submitting a form with javascript makes it ignore all the required attributes, is it supposed to work that way or I am missing something?
[19:51:59] <sydbarret>  $("#if1").attr('src', '/static/img/dentist_free_dentist_clinic_near_me_desktop_5ec9b313b1c8785d02d075d1.png');  works in local but not in production
[19:52:09] <sydbarret> in webhost i mean
[19:53:18] <Hoppelhase> What is #if1?
[19:54:08] <sydbarret> its the iframe i
[19:54:08] <sydbarret> d
[19:54:17] <sydbarret> it seems i need to append the domain to the url
[19:54:28] <sydbarret> on network tab is showing
[19:54:45] <sydbarret> http//static/...
[19:54:50] <sydbarret> thats wrong innit?
[19:54:55] <sydbarret> should start with domain
[19:54:58] <Hoppelhase> Yeah, I guess. iframes are not really part of the current website
[19:56:25] <sydbarret> how do add it?
[19:56:39] <sydbarret> in flask its usually with url_for()
[19:58:31] <Hoppelhase> Why do you even need an iframe when operating on the same domain?
[19:59:09] <sydbarret> iframe is just an html object
[19:59:17] <sydbarret> it works locally
[19:59:26] <Hoppelhase> But you are setting an image to it
[19:59:40] <sydbarret> yeah because the image is big
[19:59:53] <sydbarret> but thats not the point
[20:00:50] <Hoppelhase> I know, but it seems to me you are making things more complicated than necessary
[20:03:53] <sydbarret> so whats the solution?
[20:04:03] <sydbarret> im tell you that works fine locally
[20:04:48] <sydbarret> should link to something likehttp://example.com/sqa/static
[20:05:06] <sydbarret> and not http://static
[20:05:10] <sydbarret> ..
[20:05:44] <Hoppelhase> You can store the URL base in a global var
[20:06:28] <Hoppelhase> But my point was, if you just set images in the iframe, you don't need an iframe in the first place :p
[20:07:01] <Hoppelhase> There's also window.location
[23:25:45] <Woet> is there a way to trigger the $(function(){ ..... }); manually? dealing with a legacy project, would like to avoid refactoring it into a separate function.
[23:40:14] <Hoppelhase> Woet: What are you trying to do with it?
[23:40:37] <Woet> Hoppelhase: some legacy code is inside the $(...) onload callback that needs to be triggered again
[23:41:20] <Hoppelhase> After it has been run for the first time?
[23:42:12] <Woet> correct
[23:43:40] <Hoppelhase> Not sure it even stores it beyong that
[23:44:07] <Woet> hm, that's possible
[23:50:45] <Woet> oh well, let's leave it for another time. else I'll just put it on .on('ready') and use .trigger('ready') somewhere
