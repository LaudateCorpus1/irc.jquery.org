[00:19:04] <Kartagis> how sensible to use one big js file instead of multiple js files for each html file?
[00:20:29] <Cork> Kartagis: depends on what you want to optimize for
[00:20:56] <Cork> if first load time (of the first page) is what is important, then ya it is sensible to use small separate files
[00:21:15] <Cork> if over all navigation matters more then a big one is more sensible (for now)
[00:21:27] <Cork> http/2 will change that though
[00:32:47] <arup_r> Hey All.. Need some suggestions. I have a table of data .. I am using <table> for those ofcourse. It has say name, created_date and etct etc ... Now I want to filter the data inside the table in frontend only.. How should I go ahead with this to implement ?
[00:33:11] <arup_r> filter data by name and created_at
[00:34:08] <Cork> arup_r: depends on how big the table is
[00:34:39] <Cork> a simple selector on the column and then checking if it exist or not works if the table isn't huge
[00:34:46] <Cork> (say < 10000 rows)
[00:35:00] <Cork> hmm actually lets make that < 1000
[00:36:35] <luvmyh0nda> Hi! Is there a way to set the position of the values for a jq ui slider/
[00:36:35] <arup_r> Cork: I have a pagination ,,, and 50 <tr> per page
[00:37:19] <Cork> arup_r: then i would make sure check td has a class with the type of content they contain (to avoid possible colspan problems)
[00:37:22] <arup_r> Well. How would I search the text accross the rows .. any plugin or idea?
[00:38:20] <Cork> and just do table.find('.column-you-want-to-filter-on').filter(function() { return $(this).text() != search; }).closest('tr').hide()
[00:38:41] <arup_r> same my 2nd <td> of each row is name .. and suppose I am passing text "ar" and then want to search all tr of the second td
[00:39:04] <arup_r> Cork: cool
[00:39:04] <Cork> arup_r: if you don't care about the colspan problem, you can just use :nth-child
[00:39:13] <arup_r> I can use Regex while  searching..
[00:39:18] <Cork> yes
[00:39:23] <Cork> but i would recommend using the class solution
[00:39:40] <Cork> less headache in the long run
[00:39:48] <arup_r> Cork: I am using Bootstrap class to show tables,, so I think they will handle it.. but I need to check btw
[00:40:12] <arup_r> Cork: I will use class ofcoure that is clean
[00:40:20] <arup_r> but I got the idea now.. Thanks Cork
[00:40:38] <Cork> well nth-child is fairly clean too
[00:40:56] <Cork> but class means you can connect it easier with the ui if you want to allow them to pick what to filter on
[00:43:52] <arup_r> Cork:  I have a filter icon, and once someone click on it, the input box will come ... and users will write on it.. and filter has to be done lively
[00:44:11] <arup_r> this is the feature.. I am going to implement
[00:44:42] <arup_r> I will add the class name-filter to the name <td> and the created-date-filter to the other
[00:45:08] <arup_r> and I will use what you said - table.find('.column-you-want-to-filter-on').filter(function() { return $(this).text() != search; }).closest('tr').hide()
[00:45:25] <arup_r> I will do search matching using Regex
[00:45:38] <arup_r> till now I am done.. and got it
[00:45:38] <Cork> don't forget you will have to reset the filter before you start
[00:45:50] <Cork> cause else you will not see the one that didn't match the last time you ran it
[00:45:52] <arup_r> Yes.. my next question is that :)
[00:46:24] <arup_r> reset I will do.. let me tell you the idea I have
[00:47:21] <arup_r> when there will be nothing in the text field... I will just show all rows.. if there is something I will match and show matched results..
[00:47:35] <arup_r> is it a good idea ?
[00:49:35] <Cork> arup_r: it is usually how filters work :)
[00:53:09] <arup_r> Cork: Thanks
[00:55:08] <arup_r> Cork: One more thing..  How can I do the filer live .. like Jquery autocomplete does.
[00:55:18] <arup_r> I want the filter to be live..
[00:59:07] <Cork> arup_r: do it on an input event on the input field
[00:59:45] <arup_r> the autocomplete plugin you meant ?
[01:00:06] <Cork> arup_r: no
[01:00:23] <Cork> arup_r: $('#search').on('input, function() {});
[01:00:58] <arup_r> Cork: Ok. .keyup() as an event ?
[01:01:05] <Cork> no
[01:01:11] <Cork> read what i've told you twice now
[01:01:21] <Uhkis>  third time's the charm
[01:01:49] * arup_r goes to open the .on() doc to understand what is "input" event..
[01:01:59] <Cork> ...
[01:02:08] <Cork> the event called "input"?
[01:02:31] <Uhkis> ?mdn inputevent
[01:02:32] <b-ot> Uhkis: InputEvent - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/InputEvent
[01:02:42] <arup_r> I never knew it
[01:02:51] <Cork> ?mdn input event
[01:02:52] <b-ot> Cork: input - Event reference | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[01:03:14] <Cork> arup_r: ya, many MANY use keydown or keyup instead
[01:03:19] <Cork> but those are MUCH worse events
[01:03:23] <arup_r> Cork: and Uhkis Thanks to teach me this
[01:03:35] <Cork> input is a newer event, but it has existed for a long time
[01:03:37] <arup_r> I didn't know
[01:03:42] <arup_r> ok
[01:03:48] <Cork> (i think it was added in 2006 or so)
[01:04:20] <Uhkis> if even ie9 supports it, must be really old ;)
[01:04:27] <arup_r> lol
[01:04:50] * arup_r going to save this conversation as its Night work material.. !
[01:04:57] <arup_r> as his**
[01:49:23] <nirakara> in line 117 of the source of http://vnjs.net/www/project/freewall/example/nested-grid.html ; what does that do? if there are no items in bricks then assign bricks to what...?
[01:53:08] <Cork> nirakara: is .length is falcy (0) make bricks the .size320 element
[01:53:42] <Cork> (why they didn't just use if() there is beyond me though)
[02:06:38] <Xatenev> Anybody familiar with chrome extensions here? (Its not rly jquery, asked in JS too)
[02:06:45] <Xatenev> shouldnt "background": {
[02:06:45] <Xatenev>   "scripts": ["background.js"]
[02:06:45] <Xatenev> }, allow me to work without a popup?
[02:07:23] <Cork> Xatenev: you should ask in a chrome extension dev channel
[02:07:33] <Xatenev> there is one?
[02:07:34] <Xatenev> aa
[02:08:16] <Cork> Xatenev: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum
[02:08:33] <Cork> opps wrong link

[02:08:44] <Cork> there
[02:08:58] <Xatenev> thanks Cork
[02:09:04] <Xatenev> im in the IRC right now
[02:09:39] <Cork> ya, but they don't have an irc channel as far as i know

[03:55:38] <Kartagis> $("#form").serialize() why am I getting unexpected string with this?
[03:58:23] <AndrewBC___> Hi, I'm sure you guys get this question a lot. I'm cloning an input[type=text] but when I type into it the new text doesn't get passed in the form submission becayse the empty value gets passed over. How do I prevent that? I'm already changing id and other such things
[03:58:56] <AndrewBC___> Do I have to watch it and manually track it to make sure the DOM gets update?
[04:00:14] <AndrewBC___> Every place online talks about cloning with a value already, instead of cloning an empty field and then filling it out
[04:13:11] <Kartagis> testcase?
[04:24:43] <Cery> greetings JQuery pros, :) i’ve ran into a slight issue with an animation. i’ve got a div which i animate the left pattribute and the opacity. Somehow the animation does not start at the specified 50% but at ~18%. So my animation has a jump at the beginning. have you got an idea why? Should i upload a jsfiddle?
[04:28:42] <Cork> Cery: just guessing that is might be cause of overflow, but ya a jsfiddle would help
[04:35:34] <Cery> cork: what do you mean with overflow? -im currently setting up a jsfiddle
[04:35:53] <Cork> Cery: children flowing outside the size of the parent element
[04:36:03] <Cork> in css that is called overflow
[04:36:19] <Cery> my elements are absolute positioned, is that still a problem then?
[04:41:05] <Cery> it works on firefox btw. i only expirence this on safari
[04:46:40] <Kartagis> Initialize with $.fn.cropper method what does this mean?
[04:48:03] <Kartagis> $(function(cropper) { ... }); ?
[04:51:01] <Cery> Cork: i’ve found the cause of the problem: the -webkit-transform messes the animation up somehow here is a js fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/qyd95fgh/
[04:52:42] <Cery> on firefox it works due to -moz-transform beeing used
[04:53:18] <Cery> also only with negative -webkit-transform values
[04:54:17] <Cery> looks like a bug to me….
[05:15:22] <Kartagis> Initialize with $.fn.cropper method what does this mean? I've tried $(function(cropper){... }); but I still get $(...).cropper is not a function
[05:16:55] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/6trz1hL5/1/
[05:18:02] <shoky_> Kartagis that cropper.js is pretty empty ;p  http://html.webcinizim.com/cropper.js
[05:18:25] <shoky_> and don't do $(function(cropper)...
[05:19:02] <Kartagis> what do I do?
[05:19:57] <shoky_> include the right file
[05:21:01] <Kartagis> no no, you said not to do $(function(cropper)...
[05:21:06] <shoky_> right. don't
[05:21:11] <Kartagis> what do I do instead?
[05:21:13] <shoky_> nothing
[05:21:29] <shoky_> $.fn.cropper  is the function you call with  $(something).cropper(...)
[05:21:44] <shoky_> it's not available because you're not including the right cropper.js  file
[05:35:34] <Kartagis> I still get that
[06:15:40] <Kartagis> can you link me to a nice cropping plugin that you use and also teach me how to use it?
[06:50:54] <Pazician> Hello everyone. I'm dealing with WordPress and I want to load the single.php, the specific post into my index page. It's working below 800px but above it's loading nothing and resulting in a blank section, what am I doing wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/eexs4yk8/
[06:56:22] <ironfroggy_> Is it possible to programmatically set the width of a UI DatePicker? I need to set it without doing so in CSS, because the necessary width changes.
[07:24:03] <Pazician> Let me bring it up again, I'm dealing with WordPress and I want to load the single.php, the specific post into my index page. It's working below 800px but above it's loading nothing and resulting in a blank section, what am I doing wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/eexs4yk8/
[07:27:04] <taplar> Pazician: so say again.  what do you have to do to see the issue?  i got the page in full view so w/h should be > 800px for me.
[07:28:14] <jphase> Pazician: looks like it's doing exactly what it's told - line 88 of your example makes the code not execute < 800
[07:28:28] <jphase> or a different set of code rather
[07:29:22] <Pazician> taplar: But it's right, I mean the code 90 - 92 and the other ones should Only be executed if the window width is below 800px
[07:31:13] <taplar> are you talking about the initial load of the page, or do i need to click something?
[07:33:23] <Pazician> taplar: Yes, you gotta click on the "menu" trigger in the middle of the result screen and then you'll see 2 of the posts, but it'll not work since I haven't got it up online yet and there's no single.php to get it from nor the actual post, but it should work if you just paste an article, since it get the data from the "href", just to make a confirm if it's getting the data on the full width too, right?
[07:33:48] <Pazician> Oh yeah, and the little arrow, the exapnder icon thing on the right side
[07:33:58] <plamb> if im trying to handle form submission with jquery, is it possible to grab the form data without having a unique id on the <form> element?
[07:33:58] <Pazician> *expander, sorry
[07:34:20] <plamb> is there some way to grab the form the submit button is within without specifying a unique ID
[07:36:00] <monk3y> plamb: sure.  $("#button").closest("form"); .. I think.
[07:36:06] <monk3y> https://api.jquery.com/closest/
[07:36:17] <ironfroggy_> not all fields are inside forms anymore tho
[07:36:24] <ironfroggy_> they might also be connected via a form attribute
[07:36:30] <plamb> what if the submit button doesnt have a unique id either
[07:36:51] <ironfroggy_> plamb: do you have more than one submit button on the page?
[07:36:54] <plamb> basically, i have a page where a bunch of forms are auto generated
[07:36:56] <plamb> yes
[07:37:05] <plamb> but each "submit" is within its own <form>
[07:37:47] <plamb> so i was wondering if theres some way to grab the parent form so i dont have to figure out how to generate uniqueID's for each form
[07:38:03] <monk3y> plamb: I just put #button as a suggestion.  You can bind it however you want.
[07:38:22] <monk3y> ironfroggy_: form-via-attribute?  I think I know what you mean, but can you point to an example?
[07:38:22] <plamb> how would you bind it though
[07:38:30] <plamb> with the class the submit buttons have?
[07:38:51] <monk3y> Well, at what point/what event do you want to get the form?  On-render?  Or on submit?
[07:39:05] <plamb> i suppose on submit
[07:39:14] <plamb> right now i have it running the code on document.ready
[07:40:22] <monk3y> plamb: do you want to do this same action on every/any submit button click?
[07:40:31] <plamb> yep
[07:40:43] <plamb> every submit button does the same thing with the inputs its next to
[07:40:48] <plamb> in the enclosed <form>
[07:40:54] <monk3y> plamb: and do they all have the same class on them - or can they have one (that's unique to them - not on any unrelated element)?
[07:41:14] <plamb> they all have the same class on them right now
[07:41:37] <monk3y> Ok.  So, bind a click event to submit buttons with that class then find their parent form.  Does that sound .. sound?
[07:41:49] <plamb> yeah that might do it
[07:42:04] <plamb> if the submit buttons class is class="hideme" what would that code look like?
[07:43:17] <plamb> like this?
[07:43:18] <plamb>  $(".hideme").closest(form).submit(function( event ) {
[07:43:49] <monk3y> plamb: nah.
[07:44:03] <plamb> :(
[07:44:22] <Pazician> taplar: Are you finding anything?
[07:44:33] <monk3y> I'm toeing the line of writing it for you, but your thinking is in the right direction.
[07:44:35] <taplar> i was pulled away for a sec, catching up
[07:44:45] <plamb> im really new to jquery
[07:44:55] <plamb>  $(".hideme").closest("form").submit(function( event ) { ??
[07:44:58] <Pazician> taplar: Alright, thanks a lot for taking your time
[07:44:58] <monk3y> So first; how come you can't just hit the submit buttons and they submit the forms that contain them, like default browser behaviour?
[07:45:10] <plamb> because i dont want the page to reload
[07:45:15] <monk3y> Ah.
[07:45:30] <monk3y> So I'll try to do this without prescribing it verbatim, is that ok?
[07:45:34] <plamb> okay
[07:46:06] <taplar> Pazician: not sure i'm recreating it.  i refreshed it max screen and very tiny screen.  both cases clicking the menu worked and clicking one of the links worked
[07:46:53] <plamb> basically, say, you have 300 forms contained in <li>'s going down the center of the page, each time you submit one it .slideUp()'s
[07:47:03] <Pazician> taplar: Yeah, everything works just as I wanted but the problem is it's not loading the data to the section if the screen is above 800px
[07:47:19] <plamb> thats the sort of behavior i want; each form submission is handled by ajax so i dont have to reload the page
[07:47:43] <taplar> plamb: you possibly want to use a button rather than a submit button then
[07:47:56] <plamb> oh?
[07:48:14] <plamb> like type="button" ?
[07:48:15] <taplar> a submit button you would have to cancel the event
[07:48:16] <taplar> regular button you would not
[07:48:21] <taplar> yep
[07:48:33] <taplar> then on('click') do whatever you want
[07:48:51] <plamb> if i use type="button" do i not need event.preventDefault()
[07:49:03] <monk3y> plamb: yeah if you use <input type="button"> in a bound function, you have to preventDefault() to stop it from submitting.  But <button> apparently doesn't need to be 'stopped'.
[07:49:10] <taplar> nope, nothing to prevent
[07:49:31] <taplar> no, input type="button" does not submit a form
[07:49:34] <taplar> input type="submit" does
[07:50:07] <plamb> in that case, how does this look
[07:50:09] <plamb> $(".hideme")on('click').closest("form").submit(function( event ) {
[07:50:09] <monk3y> Sorry yeah meant "submit".  Typo/braino.
[07:50:30] <cerkauskas> Hello. I can't seem to get jquery. I get TypeError: $ is not a function, even though I have <script type='text/javascript' src='path/to/jquery.js'></script> in my head tag. What I could be possibly doing wrong?
[07:51:02] <taplar> make sure the path is correct
[07:51:13] <plamb> i missed a period but you get the idea
[07:51:58] <monk3y> plamb: you can't bind on-click then call the closest(form) function.  You need to go into the closure first, then find the closest(form) in there.
[07:52:10] <plamb> hmm
[07:52:19] <zumba_ad_> folks, i've got this scenario: Let's say we make an ajax call while our network is done. Our timeout is set to 2 mins(i know it's long, it's just an example). Our request in chrome network tab will be in pending. After 1 min, we enable our network again on our machine. What will jquery do? Will jquery retry it? Will the browser retry it? From my obeservation, it becomes 200 OK after some time but there is not data. That's where I'm confused
[07:52:30] <taplar> plamb: $('.hideme').on('click', function(event){ /* whatever logic */ });
[07:52:47] <plamb> hmmm
[07:52:48] <monk3y> plamb: So; $(".hideme").on("click", function(event) { var form = $(this).closest("form"); .. });
[07:53:30] <plamb> does $(this) always refer to the original first bind
[07:53:40] <taplar> no
[07:53:48] <taplar> it refers to the context
[07:54:01] <taplar> which for an event handler is the bound element
[07:54:14] <taplar> or the delegate element if that's being used
[07:54:27] <taplar> but for things like each() 'this' refers to the current iterated element
[07:54:38] <taplar> it just depends
[07:54:50] <monk3y> plamb: yeah, if you did $("body").on("click", ".hideme", function(e).. $(this) would be "body", right?
[07:55:07] <taplar> no, it would be the hideme
[07:55:46] <plamb> so how does this look
[07:55:47] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/Jh9RJuHA
[07:55:48] <monk3y> Sorry; thought by 'delegate' you meant the bound/ancestral element delegating for the child element.
[07:56:17] <taplar> yeah i kinda worded that weird
[07:56:29] <taplar> plamb: you don't need to do a submit
[07:56:34] <plamb> really?
[07:56:35] <taplar> you said your going to be doing it with ajax
[07:57:00] <taplar> just get your data, do your request, and whatever else you need
[07:57:04] <plamb> i see
[07:57:21] <plamb> so this then
[07:57:21] <Pazician> taplar: Did you figure out what could possible be wrong with the code? https://jsfiddle.net/eexs4yk8/1/
[07:57:22] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/sDN7WUFG
[07:58:16] <monk3y> plamb: do all your generated forms' inputs have the same names?
[07:58:20] <plamb> yes
[07:58:35] <taplar> Pazician: no, i'm not really sure i understand the issue so not sure where to start looking
[07:59:13] <taplar> plamb: uh, that use of the {} after closest isn't valid
[07:59:16] <monk3y> plamb: firstly $(this).closest("form") isn't a function ("{").
[07:59:19] <taplar> i don't believe
[07:59:32] <plamb> ok so remove the brackets
[07:59:51] <taplar> var $form = $(this).closest('form'); //use $form
[07:59:52] <monk3y> plamb: you need to find the form and put it in a variable, then get the specific input values within that form, then send them as the data.
[08:00:12] <taplar> plamb: did you say your new to jquery?
[08:00:16] <plamb> very
[08:00:16] <plamb> lol
[08:00:17] <Pazician> taplar: Let me explain it for you. The issue is that my posts content from the file single.php is not loading into the section called .project-info BUT it's working just fine and getting the content from single.php IF the screen is BELOW 800 pixels. But if the screen is bigger then 800px it's not getting the content from single.php
[08:00:41] <taplar> plamb: have you given try.jquery.com a looksie?  can be helpful
[08:00:51] <monk3y> plamb: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[08:01:33] <plamb> if i have that stored in $form, how do i grab the input elements?
[08:01:38] <plamb> $form.somethinghere ?
[08:01:39] <monk3y> plamb: the last example on that page has similar things to what you need.
[08:01:50] <plamb> ahh
[08:01:54] <plamb> $form.find
[08:02:17] <plamb> those dont need the "var" prefix >?
[08:03:42] <monk3y> Var would be good here, because you only need these vars in this tiny scope, so be clear about it.
[08:03:55] <Pazician> taplar: Do you understand my issue and my struggle here?
[08:05:31] <plamb> alright, how does this look
[08:05:32] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/LLpJiY30
[08:08:21] <monk3y> plamb: the ajax call doesn't look right, but let's finish off the input values first.  Do you absolutely need them all separated like that?
[08:08:29] <monk3y> plamb: and what's the jsRoutes..Linkedin .. thing?
[08:08:37] <plamb> its something for play framework
[08:08:41] <plamb> dont need to worry about that
[08:08:50] <monk3y> And it's a library function you just need to run?
[08:08:56] <plamb> its just sending off those values to some code in Play
[08:08:59] <plamb> yeah
[08:09:26] <plamb> i dont need them all separated, but it helps me think about it
[08:10:16] <plamb> also, it handles the type : and url :
[08:10:50] <monk3y> Well I do, because it's in the middle of an ajax call that usually needs a URL, method, data, etc.
[08:10:51] <monk3y> So .. instead of the ajax call .. just call the Linkedin function?
[08:10:51] <monk3y> If it does all the requesting and responding itself, then you don't need to.
[08:10:51] <monk3y> You only need .ajax (or .get/.post) if you yourself are submitting to a URL.  In this case; you're calling a function.
[08:11:37] <plamb> it actually is submitting to a URL behind the scenes
[08:11:43] <plamb> but supposedly all that is handled
[08:11:46] <plamb> https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ScalaJavascriptRouting
[08:16:34] <monk3y> plamb: yeah I thought it'd be doing some magic for you.  And I see from the link you just gave me that it's returning what you need for .ajax.
[08:16:47] <plamb> argh, the JS didnt work
[08:17:32] <monk3y> What happened/didn't happen/came out in the console?
[08:17:39] <plamb> nothing happened when i clicked submit
[08:17:51] <plamb> btw, i dont need action= or method= defined on <form>
[08:17:54] <plamb> with this JS right?
[08:18:33] <plamb> that part is noticeably absent in the documentation link i just posted
[08:19:20] <monk3y> Nah it looks like that library function takes care of that; it just needs the data (email/etc)
[08:19:37] <monk3y> The form element in this case is just a container for inputs, and you grab them on-click.
[08:19:52] <plamb> yeah, so nothing in the console in inspector or in my terminal
[08:20:07] <monk3y> So going step-by-step; can you put a console.log in the first line of the $(".hideme").on("click", function() { .. ?
[08:20:45] <plamb> like so?
[08:20:47] <plamb>             $(".hideme").on("click", function(event) {
[08:20:48] <plamb>             console.log
[08:21:31] <monk3y> Yep; but actually log something.  Like console.log("Submit clicked!");
[08:21:46] <plamb> roger
[08:21:48] <plamb> ill retry
[08:21:50] <monk3y> And/or send me your latest pastebin please.
[08:22:03] <monk3y> (I closed all previous, and not sure if you've updated)
[08:22:50] <plamb> current: http://pastebin.com/JJw9k4QM
[08:22:57] <plamb> just retryed, still nothing
[08:23:43] <plamb> the button's html looks like this
[08:23:58] <plamb> <input type="button" value="submit" class="hideme">
[08:25:22] <monk3y> plamb: where have you got that $(document).ready() code, and how/when are you generating your forms?
[08:25:39] <plamb> its in the <head>
[08:25:43] <monk3y> Ah.
[08:25:44] <plamb> as a <script>
[08:26:07] <plamb> oh
[08:26:08] <plamb> well
[08:26:13] <plamb> the forms get generated later
[08:26:16] <plamb> via an ajax call
[08:26:19] <plamb> that might be the issue
[08:26:27] <monk3y> Next lesson in jQuery; when you bind things (like $(".hideme").on("click"..)) to elements that are dynamically generated, it won't work because, in <head>, the bind is attempted when they don't exist.
[08:26:36] <plamb> exactly
[08:26:38] <plamb> lol
[08:26:43] <plamb> is it still possible to do this?
[08:26:53] <plamb> like the JS runs after they're generated?
[08:26:55] <monk3y> Can you tell me the closest parent/container element in which all the forms are created?
[08:27:19] <plamb> the div that all the results get put into
[08:27:24] <monk3y> -that is there when the page is created?
[08:27:33] <plamb> is <div id="results> though that is there when the page is created
[08:27:36] <monk3y> Sure.  That's there on first-render?  It's not dynamically generated?
[08:27:38] <monk3y> Excellent.
[08:28:03] <Pazician> taplar: I think I got a clue of it - if I change the .find() to like article.post .project-info it's not working neither below 800px nor above it, so it gotta be it's not "finding" the element, right?
[08:28:08] <monk3y> So change the binding to; $("div#results").on("click", ".hideme", function(event) { ..
[08:28:20] <monk3y> (plamb)
[08:28:24] <plamb> even though the results are generated later?
[08:29:00] <monk3y> Yep.  That last line binds the listener to the static div, but the second argument in .on() is the actual selector to 'watch' for.
[08:29:08] <plamb> roger
[08:29:16] <monk3y> So you're telling div#result to look for an event coming in for .hideme.
[08:29:36] <Pazician> taplar: Alright, I got it! - The thing is now the close button is disappearing
[08:29:58] <plamb> ok i got the submit clicked console.log
[08:30:11] <monk3y> Good.
[08:30:12] <plamb> and then got a 404 on the url it tried to POST too
[08:30:16] <plamb> but thats not a jquery error
[08:30:17] <monk3y> Wellllll
[08:30:21] <plamb> so ill go try and figure it out
[08:30:27] <monk3y> That's the jsRoute/Linkedin black-hole.
[08:30:29] <monk3y> Cool.
[08:30:30] <plamb> yep
[08:30:39] <plamb> thanks a bunch man, woulda taken me 18 years to figure that out
[08:30:43] <monk3y> Nah.
[08:30:51] <monk3y> 18hours of Googling and tinkering.
[08:31:15] <plamb> haha
[08:31:18] <monk3y> And thanks/sorry to taplar for clearing up some thing.s
[08:32:08] <Pazician> Why does .load() remove everything inside the element section?
[08:32:54] <taplar> sorry i'm spacing out.  stuff going on in the office
[08:35:10] <monk3y> $("#taplar").on("stuff", "#hisOffice", function() { $(this).forget(irc); }
[08:35:24] <taplar> lmao
[08:36:33] <taplar> reminds me of one time a person in the office mentioned she and another person had been working on a javascirpt issue for an hour or so and it was being really difficult, and they just wanted it to run!
[08:36:49] <Uhkis> why does his office forget irc
[08:36:51] <taplar> so i told her something like: document.parent.realWorld.program.justRun()
[08:37:22] <monk3y> heheh
[08:37:56] <monk3y> It'd be pretty funny if browser's DOM really did have an API to the real world there - we just never thought to run it.
[08:39:25] <monk3y> world = document.parent.realWorld; world.setGravity(world.getGravity() * 0.5);
[08:39:34] * monk3y floats
[08:41:00] <taplar> (pushes up his glasses and does the steryotypical nerd lisp voice) It's not a coincidence that DOM spelled backwards is MOD, which is just one letter away from GOD.
[08:41:08] <plamb> monk3y does it look like that slideUp code in .done{} is going to work when i get it POSTing correctly?
[08:42:05] <Zzaichik> Good morning youse all
[08:43:09] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning
[08:43:16] <Zzaichik> I'm curious, how would I clear a timeout as soon as it finishes? If I were to attach a setTimeout to an event that gets fired a lot, like a scroll event, I want to stop it from creating a stack. So every time it runs it would be smart to clear it.
[08:43:35] <robertmaxrees> you want a debounce or a throttle.
[08:43:45] <monk3y> plamb: well without seeing the HTML nor being experienced with slideUp() I can't be 100%, but syntactically it doesn't look broken.
[08:43:53] <plamb> okay cool
[08:44:17] <robertmaxrees> Zzaichik a debounce would wait until you're done scrolling, a throttle would reduce the number of times the handler is fired.
[08:44:45] <Zzaichik> interesting. I'll check those out. Thank you sir
[08:45:03] <robertmaxrees> Zzaichik a lot of scroll handlers need one or the other and you should also include your other optimizations.
[08:45:14] <Zzaichik> okay
[08:45:22] <Zzaichik> yeah scroll handlers can get out of control quickly
[08:45:45] <plamb> monk3y: lol got it working
[08:45:56] <plamb> the slideUp() slid up every since form
[08:46:06] <plamb> every single*
[08:46:07] <monk3y> "every since"?
[08:46:08] <monk3y> ah
[08:46:39] <plamb> hmm
[08:46:47] <plamb> i wonder if $(this) would do it
[08:46:51] <plamb> probably not
[08:47:21] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[08:47:34] <robertmaxrees> oh, posting a form?
[08:47:39] <plamb> robertmaxrees:
[08:47:41] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/aVgNynA9
[08:47:49] <plamb> the code inside .done{}
[08:47:52] <robertmaxrees> ()
[08:47:56] <robertmaxrees> not {} ;)
[08:47:59] <plamb> its sliding up all 300 forms
[08:48:11] <monk3y> Yeah.  You might want to console.log what your closest("li.item") function is actually selecting.
[08:48:18] <robertmaxrees> you need to make it relative to $form
[08:48:32] <robertmaxrees> is .hideme a parent of the form oor...?
[08:48:37] <robertmaxrees> what does your markup look it?
[08:48:39] <robertmaxrees> *like
[08:48:55] <Pazician> How can I write this and avoid to remove everything inside the .project-info section? $('article.post').find('.project-info').load(post_link);
[08:48:59] <plamb> $form.find("input[type='button']").closest('li.item').slideUP() ?
[08:49:11] <robertmaxrees> uh
[08:49:12] <plamb> each form is within a <li class="item">
[08:49:20] <robertmaxrees> that looks really.. overly complicated.
[08:49:24] <robertmaxrees> share and example of your markup.
[08:49:25] <monk3y> plamb: re: robertmaxrees; you're forgetting that you've already grabbed your form into a variable.  Use it again.
[08:49:49] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you just need to $form.closest('.item').slideUp()
[08:49:53] <monk3y> That's the one.
[08:50:00] <plamb> ahh
[08:50:19] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Line 113: https://jsfiddle.net/eexs4yk8/7/
[08:50:33] <robertmaxrees> ?
[08:50:37] <Pazician> It remove the icon on the right on the top, but now it's not loading any data tho
[08:50:40] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[08:51:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:52:01] <robertmaxrees> replication steps, i guess?
[08:52:03] <robertmaxrees> kiind of a big fiddle.
[08:52:08] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: When you click on the menu trigger button then choose Gallery and click on the expander icon on the right in the post you can see a dialog looking kinda section, which is loading content but .load() is removing everything inside it and loads the data, I want to append the data so I can keep the elements inside the section
[08:52:31] <robertmaxrees> then don't use .load()
[08:52:41] <robertmaxrees> use $.ajax() and append the data in the .done() callback.
[08:53:07] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Hmm... Sounds like an overkill for me, could you do a example for me inside near the line 113?
[08:53:14] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[08:53:18] <robertmaxrees> you can try though ;)
[08:53:22] <robertmaxrees> it's not overkill btw.
[08:53:35] <robertmaxrees> you don't really have a choice - .load() replaces the contents of the target element.
[08:54:06] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I see, thanks. Can I use $(this).attr('href') for the url:
[08:54:17] <robertmaxrees> why would that part change?
[08:54:33] <robertmaxrees> you're not modifying how you get the url - you're replacing your .load() use with $.ajax()
[08:55:20] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Hmm... I'm looking at this atm, and trying to figure out how to do to get the url right, since I'm using WordPress CMS and I want to load the single.php (single post data for the specific post) https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/jquery-ajax-methods/
[08:55:27] <Pazician> Oh
[08:55:36] <robertmaxrees> wut
[08:55:43] <robertmaxrees> you're making this too hard.
[08:56:00] <Pazician> Hold, lol - I do see that, let me see if I'm doing it right
[08:56:33] <robertmaxrees> i've always thought it strange that people will address me and assume i have an immediate answer, and then tell me to "hold".
[08:57:05] <robertmaxrees> like, ask the channel for help - why am i the only one who can assist? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:57:36] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Alright, I'm kinda lost again....
[08:57:50] <Pazician> I've no clue how to get this done with the code I already have
[08:57:52] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have.
[08:58:30] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Line 115: https://jsfiddle.net/eexs4yk8/8/
[08:58:42] <robertmaxrees> that's still a huge fiddle haha
[08:58:47] <robertmaxrees> wat
[08:58:49] <Pazician> Is that right?
[08:58:53] <robertmaxrees> not even close.
[08:58:58] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/3c707de82c87
[08:59:00] <robertmaxrees> like...
[08:59:02] <robertmaxrees> read the docs?
[08:59:47] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I'm trying I was reading the learn.jquery.com since last time we was in touch
[09:00:06] <supsup> anyone ever use bootstrap and jquery ui datepicker together?  When I try to use a datepicker in a modal it does not change the date visually but does update the date internally
[09:01:09] <zumba_ad_> does jquery have similar like $q all
[09:01:13] <Pazician> robbyoconnor: It works but now every time I click on the expander button I get the load in content every time
[09:10:29] <AliG1000> Hi - am I able to pull in external content into Bootstrap tabs?
[10:10:21] <nirakara> hi
[10:10:47] <robertmaxrees> hello
[10:11:38] <JosefDe> Hi guys. Can anyone tell me why this is not working?: https://jsfiddle.net/scsj002v/1/
[10:11:56] <JosefDe> I'm just only trying to get value of a neighbour td
[10:11:58] <robertmaxrees> works fine here.
[10:12:12] <robertmaxrees> oh why it's not selecting the sibling of the parent?
[10:12:16] <JosefDe> yes
[10:12:19] <robertmaxrees> .closest() only goes 'up'
[10:12:35] <JosefDe> Yeah. And the td I want to select is in the up
[10:12:49] <taplar_> and to the side
[10:12:49] <robertmaxrees> .appointmentInfo isn't an ancestor.
[10:12:55] <robertmaxrees> it's a sibling of a parent.
[10:13:02] <JosefDe> And how can I select it?
[10:13:06] <robertmaxrees> use .closest() to get the tr and then .find() the td you want.
[10:13:13] <JosefDe> :)
[10:13:14] <arup_r> Can I use comma separated selector inside find() like `$( "#div-id" ).find( "a.class1, a.class2" )`
[10:13:15] <arup_r> ?
[10:13:25] <robertmaxrees> arup_r would that be a valid selector? ;)
[10:13:46] <arup_r> humm, yes
[10:14:05] <robertmaxrees> the .find() docs tell you that you can pass a selector to find, so that will work.
[10:14:20] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: The problem is, that the two td's are in the same tr
[10:14:33] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: So why shall I do this double search?
[10:14:39] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: thanks
[10:14:45] <robertmaxrees> because it's the most efficient, least coupled way to do it joshskidmore\
[10:14:48] <robertmaxrees> err, JosefDe
[10:15:05] <JosefDe> ?
[10:15:11] <robertmaxrees> relying on an implicit order of table elements is weird.
[10:15:17] <robertmaxrees> rely on the classes for selecing instead.
[10:16:19] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: But doing it like you said is fine?: $('clickme').closest('tr').find('.appointmentInfo')?
[10:16:36] <robertmaxrees> you want the closest of the clicked one i thought.
[10:16:42] <JosefDe> yes
[10:16:46] <JosefDe> But how shall I do it then?
[10:16:47] <robertmaxrees> so... $(this) instead of $('clickme')
[10:16:53] <JosefDe> ah yes :)
[10:17:21] <JosefDe> thanks a lot buddy
[10:20:43] <arup_r> This code is working ( http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/ZbWYXj?editors=101) Here I am matching with the creator name. Now I also want to match asset names which is inside the `<td class="name"`. Now if I write the find as `find( "td.creator-name, td.name" ).. How would I understand $(this).text() is giving value of which <td> ?
[10:20:59] <robertmaxrees> ]javascript please.
[10:21:01] <robertmaxrees> no coffeescript.
[10:21:01] <robertmaxrees> tx
[10:21:03] <arup_r> ok
[10:21:13] <robertmaxrees> also share some markup.
[10:21:17] <arup_r> http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/ZbWYXj?editors=101
[10:21:38] <robertmaxrees> that's literally the exact same.
[10:21:59] <arup_r> o it seems you are right!
[10:22:16] <arup_r> it will work if I give it like that.
[10:22:22] <arup_r> Let me try first
[10:22:41] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/5a7fd39bd7ba
[10:22:44] <robertmaxrees> this is what you mean?
[10:23:03] <arup_r> who me ?
[10:23:08] <robertmaxrees> yes
[10:23:18] <robertmaxrees> that's the JS version.
[10:23:24] <robertmaxrees> so what was your question?
[10:23:46] <arup_r> my question is
[10:24:35] <robertmaxrees> lol that's a really long question.
[10:24:50] <robertmaxrees> " if I write the find as `find( "td.creator-name, td.name" ).. How would I understand $(this).text() is giving value of which <td> ?"
[10:24:55] <arup_r> if I add `find('td.creator-name, td.name')... would $(this).text() will give me all matched td text either it is creator name or asset name ?
[10:24:55] <robertmaxrees> not sure how that's relevant in this case.
[10:25:04] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:25:19] <arup_r> hum.. I am a dumb! Please don't mind!
[10:25:21] <arup_r> :/
[10:25:43] <robertmaxrees> .filter() internally runs .each() on every matched element and removes anything that returns false
[10:25:45] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[10:26:22] <arup_r> yes.. got you
[10:26:41] <arup_r> I understand only coffeescript .. not JS syntax for now.. sorry to paste Coffeescript here
[10:26:50] <robertmaxrees> you should really learn javascript.
[10:27:11] <robertmaxrees> especially now with ES6 - coffeescript really doesn't bring anything valuable to the table.
[10:27:45] <arup_r> o i see
[10:28:19] <arup_r> it is working now.. but need to fix the regex .. not matching names like "arup text"
[10:28:48] <arup_r> if I give a, ar, aru, arup working.. but once I give there `t` no result
[10:28:52] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, I have this code that catches the ajax:error and ajax:success events, however even on success, it is still triggering the ajax:error handler. Here is the code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a3f47c2f363a6e2ad260
[10:29:04] <robertmaxrees> arup_r then make a simplified fiddle for just the regex part of things.
[10:29:07] <Scriptonaut> and here is the response object: Object {readyState: 4, responseText: "http://localhost:3000/tasks", status: 200, statusText: "OK"}
[10:29:14] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut javascript please.
[10:29:19] <arup_r> haha
[10:29:21] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:29:49] <robertmaxrees> and just because your request is returning a 200 doens't mean the success handler should be called.
[10:29:55] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: Me and Scriptonaut both are from Ruby on Rails framework.. So there somehow cofferscruipt is famous :(
[10:30:14] <Scriptonaut> I prefer JS but this project requires coffee
[10:30:15] <robertmaxrees> it's because it reminds people of ruby.
[10:30:17] <arup_r> Ask him his web framework
[10:30:18] <Scriptonaut> I'm translating it one sec
[10:30:23] <robertmaxrees> and valid js is valid coffeescrip.t
[10:30:24] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[10:30:28] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: yes you are true
[10:30:29] <Scriptonaut> yes, I'm currently doing rails
[10:30:54] <arup_r> Scriptonaut: I know you man! :D
[10:31:10] <robertmaxrees> and just because rails supports coffeescript doesn't mean you should use it ;)
[10:31:31] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: I am forced to :(
[10:31:39] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty awful.
[10:31:53] <Scriptonaut> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/robins35/6b58e50eb30802000b78
[10:32:18] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut yeah, 200 !== success for ajax.
[10:32:18] <Scriptonaut> on the bit about returning 200 doesn't mean the success handler should be called
[10:32:27] <arup_r> I joined a new project.. I wrote Jquery using JS syntax, I after that rewrote those forcefully.. otherwise my changes wouldn't be merged :/
[10:32:42] <robertmaxrees> arup_r huh?  jquery IS javascript >.>
[10:32:48] <arup_r> I know..
[10:32:50] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut the format of your returned data might be bad.
[10:32:50] <Scriptonaut> when I was using $.ajax, a 200 would trigger the success method
[10:32:58] <arup_r> I meant I had to write it using CS syntac
[10:33:07] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut what is ajax:error from?
[10:33:24] <robertmaxrees> because $.ajax() will trigger .fail()/error if the returned data is bad.
[10:33:38] <Scriptonaut> what do you mean by "bad"
[10:33:42] <Scriptonaut> like malformed?
[10:33:44] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:38:37] <arup_r> added sample data http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/ZbWYXj?editors=101 see there if I type like `pro` or `project` nothing is coming
[10:38:59] <arup_r> asset names are "arup project" ..
[10:39:19] <arup_r> it matches everything before the white space..
[10:39:33] <robertmaxrees> that's a log of code to test a regular exression.
[10:39:36] <robertmaxrees> *expression
[10:40:19] <arup_r> log od code means ?
[10:40:25] <robertmaxrees> *lot of
[10:40:56] <arup_r> ok
[10:41:07] <robertmaxrees> you want to know if one string contains another?
[10:41:11] <robertmaxrees> so let'
[10:41:20] <robertmaxrees> *let's say you have "magigical beans"
[10:41:27] <robertmaxrees> you want to match that if you have "magical"
[10:41:29] <robertmaxrees> right?
[10:41:33] <arup_r> one min
[10:41:40] <robertmaxrees> uh
[10:42:07] <arup_r> I want to select a row .. if either td.name or td.td.creator-name matches
[10:42:13] <robertmaxrees> matches what?
[10:42:14] <arup_r> but that is not happening..
[10:42:16] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm asking.
[10:42:23] <robertmaxrees> what's the criteria for a match?
[10:43:07] <arup_r> in your string it should match when you give it to bean also `b` also
[10:43:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:43:30] <arup_r> yes
[10:43:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:43:44] <robertmaxrees> you're not making sense.
[10:44:08] <arup_r> You are right.. I want to check if string contains a substring
[10:44:13] <robertmaxrees> then use indexOf().
[10:44:29] <arup_r> why not regex ?
[10:44:40] <robertmaxrees> regex is slow and overkill for this.
[10:44:44] <arup_r> ok
[10:44:51] <robertmaxrees> if (theString.indexOf(theOtherString) > -1) { console.log('welp') }
[10:45:07] <arup_r> But my main problem is I am not doing the OR logic.. as per my current code
[10:45:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:45:33] <arup_r> Yes.. `find( "td.creator-name, td.name" )` is the bug
[10:45:49] <arup_r> I can't do this way..
[10:45:54] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[10:46:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about what "the bug" is then.
[10:46:07] <arup_r> am I making sense now ?
[10:46:10] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:46:15] <arup_r> let me tell you agai
[10:47:14] <arup_r> say I have a string which matched for td.name but not td.creator-name. As per the current code, although <tr> should come.. but it is not
[10:48:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:48:37] <arup_r> :(
[10:49:06] <robertmaxrees> step back.
[10:49:34] <robertmaxrees> user types a search.  what should happen?
[10:49:50] <arup_r> <tr> <td> arup </td> <td> rakshit</td> </tr> consider the dom now..
[10:49:52] <robertmaxrees> stop
[10:49:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:50:02] <arup_r> telling you
[10:50:16] <robertmaxrees> test if the .creator-name or .name contain that string?
[10:50:26] <arup_r> yes
[10:50:44] <arup_r> either one if matches the tr should be selected
[10:50:52] <robertmaxrees> then you don't want .find()
[10:51:01] <arup_r> ok. then
[10:51:05] <arup_r> ?
[10:51:30] <robertmaxrees> .filter() the trs, in the callback, grab the two separate strings and go from there.
[10:51:42] <arup_r> woohoo..
[10:51:47] <arup_r> let me try
[10:52:29] <robertmaxrees> also, $('table#assets > tbody tr').find('td.creator-name').closest('tr'); it totally redundant.
[10:52:30] <arup_r> how to grab .. ? using children()
[10:52:38] <robertmaxrees> you still use .find().
[10:52:47] <arup_r> ok
[10:52:51] <robertmaxrees> but inside the filter.
[10:52:56] <arup_r> inside rhe callback
[10:53:00] <arup_r> let me try
[10:53:07] <robertmaxrees> also, $('table#assets > tbody tr') is not a good thing to do.
[10:53:15] <robertmaxrees> don't prepend selectors with tagnames
[10:53:42] <arup_r> .filter() the trs, in the callback means ?
[10:53:53] <robertmaxrees> ...
[10:53:59] <robertmaxrees> you want to filter the table rows, right?
[10:55:26] <robertmaxrees> you're basically way overthinking this.
[10:55:46] <arup_r> yes
[10:55:51] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/ea5eae9a6318
[10:55:52] <robertmaxrees> like..
[10:55:53] <robertmaxrees> way simple.
[10:56:07] <robertmaxrees> you were doing a conditional to test if you show .show() things, and then showing them anyway.
[10:56:16] <robertmaxrees> i'd highly suggest reading the docs for .filter()
[10:59:49] <arup_r> I am changing my code
[11:00:02] <arup_r> that code was as per my buggy thought
[11:00:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[11:00:39] <arup_r> :)
[11:07:36] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: done!
[11:07:42] <robertmaxrees> grats
[11:27:22] <zumba_addict> hey folks, had a question earlier but lost my wifi. Does jquery have a feature similar to $q.all
[11:27:30] <robertmaxrees> what is $q.all ?
[11:28:38] <robertmaxrees> looks like some kind of angular promises dealio.
[11:29:06] <robertmaxrees> if you're working with jquery promises, kind of - need to use $.when.apply(arrayOfjqueryPromisesHere)
[11:31:09] <robertmaxrees> err, $.when.apply($, arrayOfjqueryPromisesHere)
[11:37:48] <arc_> i wonder if his wifi went out again
[11:38:18] <zumba_addict> ah cool robertmaxrees
[11:38:27] <zumba_addict> yeah, it's array of promises
[11:39:08] <zumba_addict> i'm assuming that from your example code above, it will get resolve when all the array of promises we pass are also resolved
[11:39:34] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for jquer's when
[11:39:39] <zumba_addict> cool
[11:39:56] <zumba_addict> arc_: yes, because I roam around the building with my laptop
[11:39:59] <robertmaxrees> you'd do $.when.apply($, arrayOfjqueryPromisesHere).done(function() { console.log('all done') }); for instance.
[11:40:11] <zumba_addict> and in morning, i am on train and get disconnected from at&t
[11:40:11] <Uhkis> explains your nickname :D
[11:40:20] <zumba_addict> :D hahaha
[11:40:34] <zumba_addict> they don't know, i'm wardriving
[11:40:54] <zumba_addict> they can't tell that the pringles i carry with me all the time is sniffing all the wifi networks here
[11:50:30] <`ULT> hi all!
[11:53:22] <`ULT> how can I write this line of code shorter? http://jsfiddle.net/v4wj1fma/
[11:55:33] <`ULT> and this: http://jsfiddle.net/v4wj1fma/1/
[11:59:17] <jphase> `ULT: you can use .inArray()
[11:59:45] <`ULT> yeah, oke, i thougt that also. Will read about it.
[12:16:17] <Es0teric> has anyone here used selectizejs?
[12:17:23] <Kartagis> https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropper <--- anyone knows how to use this?
[12:22:32] <hapi> Kartagis, there is a long useful readme
[12:26:03] <hapi> `ULT: http://jsfiddle.net/v4wj1fma/3/
[12:28:18] <`ULT> nice, looks good hapi.
[12:28:29] <`ULT> But I think you exampel is not working? :p
[12:28:49] <`ULT> when I change the value in the checkbox, the text is also showing
[12:29:05] <Kartagis> Initialize with $.fn.cropper method. <--- I typed this in my fiddle
[12:29:48] <Kartagis> and $("#mydiv").cropper({...}) said not a function
[12:29:57] <Kartagis> what am I doing wrong?
[12:31:40] <hapi> `ULT: i cannot tested, sorry

[12:36:23] <`ULT> working! Thx!
[12:36:26] <arup_r> but focus not happening
[12:40:21] <hapi> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/6trz1hL5/8/
[12:40:34] <hapi> it works fint for me
[12:41:05] <hapi> no, its not neevermind :D
[12:42:05] <Kartagis> it's not working

[12:42:37] <hapi> ttp://pastebin.com/Pxb5tVMg
[12:42:43] <hapi> this from the documentation
[12:42:57] <hapi> step by-step guide to get working with ajax
[12:44:57] <Kartagis> /path/to/upload is this the image location on the server?
[12:44:57] <b-ot> Kartagis: memorised “path/to/upload”.
[12:45:17] <Uhkis> lol
[12:45:20] <Kartagis> forget path/to/upload
[12:45:38] <Uhkis> ?path/to/upload
[12:45:38] <b-ot> Uhkis: this the image location on the server?
[12:45:42] <Uhkis> hahahha
[12:45:50] <Kartagis> lol
[12:45:56] <Kartagis> ?forget path/to/upload
[12:45:56] <b-ot> Kartagis: I have forgotten “path/to/upload”. My mind is going, I can feel it.
[12:50:16] <Kartagis> heh
[12:50:38] <Kartagis> even his own example is not working on jsfiddle
[12:52:18] <arup_r> Hi.. why focus not working after showing it http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/yYONmN
[12:56:02] <Velveeta> well... there's nothing to show in the example you linked... there's no html
[12:57:57] <Uhkis> wow, Velveeta is alive
[13:00:59] <hapi>  arup_r http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dYMYPd
[13:02:55] <arup_r> hapi: The focus you are seeing there in your example? I m not seeing it.. I only see when i click on the text field by mouse
[13:03:21] <arup_r> I want when it is getting shown up.. that time only to set focus on it
[13:06:09] <Velveeta> indeed!
[13:06:17] <Velveeta> it's been a while, i've been in react-land for months
[13:06:50] <Kartagis> focus event is triggered when you click in the field
[13:06:56] <Kartagis> arup_r: ^
[13:07:01] <Es0teric> is it possible to loop through these with a $.each() ? http://pastebin.com/C53pCT04
[13:07:21] <Velveeta> es0teric: yes
[13:07:29] <Es0teric> Velveeta how?
[13:07:50] <Velveeta> $.each(ids, function () { console.log(this); })
[13:08:32] <arup_r> ok.. Kartagis well. I want it to set focus on after show()
[13:09:00] <Kartagis> you want autofocus
[13:09:06] <Kartagis> that's html
[13:10:56] <Es0teric> Velveeta ok so then how do i access those vars ?
[13:11:14] <Username_> Es0teric, the syntax is $.each(object || array, function(index, value){})
[13:11:27] <Velveeta> es0teric: this.lg, this.sm, etc... there won't be an easily abstracted way to do it since each of those objects are a different shape
[13:11:29] <Es0teric> Username_ ok so then the index would be lg
[13:11:36] <Username_> the function is your callback, just use them in code, etc. console.log(index, value)
[13:11:48] <Es0teric> Username_, Velveeta ah i see so then i would have to do switch/case
[13:11:49] <Velveeta> you could do for (var key in this) { if (this.hasOwnProperty(key)) { doSomething(this[key]); }}
[13:12:09] <Username_> Es0teric, no index would be 1, 2, 3, value would be: {"vid":"#packages-video"}
[13:13:06] <Username_> Object.keys(ids).forEach(function(i, v){ i = Object.keys(v)[0], v = v[i]; /* code here */ })
[13:13:27] <Username_> then you would get key: vid, value: #packages-video
[13:13:45] <Username_> Velveeta: do you mind correcting that please :P
[13:13:58] <Es0teric> Username_ wait what?
[13:14:09] <Velveeta> heh, i would have used something more modern, but most people are still chained to IE8 ;)
[13:14:27] <Es0teric> IE... *shudders*
[13:14:28] <Es0teric> ush
[13:14:29] <Es0teric> *ugh
[13:14:32] <Velveeta> i also thought about using _.forOwn(), but wasn't sure if underscore was available ;)
[13:14:49] <Es0teric> Username_ ok so what would be the full syntax?
[13:14:56] <Username_> [0, 1, 2,] <- what does this do in IE
[13:14:57] <arup_r> just tried Kartagis .. didnt work
[13:15:17] <Velveeta> oddly enough, it functions properly in IE
[13:15:26] <Velveeta> at least, by the old rules
[13:15:27] <Username_> Velveeta, well not so much now that XP has expired.
[13:15:45] <Username_> Velveeta, [0,1,2,] in IE equals [0,1,2,3]
[13:15:47] <Es0teric> Username_ ?
[13:16:12] <Velveeta> well, [0,1,2,] in IE should throw doesn't it?
[13:17:37] <RickYentzer> I'm at a loss, I want to reset the position of a div when I hover over different table rows. That part works. But when I leave the table and then hover back over it, instead of resetting the div position, the values are added to. I basically want the div to hover when over a row, then disappear when leaving the table. Here is the jsbin link: http://jsbin.com/vovago/edit?js,output
[13:17:40] <Username_> oops, i did it wrong, one trailing comma throw, two and it puts it in there for you
[13:19:23] <Es0teric> Username_ that syntax you sent didnt work
[13:19:31] <Es0teric> it just displays "undefined"
[13:19:35] <Username_> RickYentzer: looking at it, it seems to work fine in chrome and nightly
[13:20:20] <Username_> wait chrome is doing something weird when i leave the table completely..
[13:20:25] <Nolski> Hi all, I got a question for those of you who used jQuery migrate. Does that end up keeping a lot of the XSS fixes in the newer versions?
[13:20:59] <RickYentzer> That's the issue. Once I leave the table and come back to it the 1st and last row is janked
[13:22:50] <Es0teric> damn why is it so hard to loop through an array of objects while dynamically grabbing the key?
[13:23:13] <Username_> RickYentzer: not sure, but to me it looks like it's picking up the borders, try attachting event to each cell
[13:23:16] <Nolski> Es0teric: arrays don't have keys
[13:23:33] <Es0teric> Nolski http://pastebin.com/C53pCT04
[13:23:35] <Es0teric> i was talking about that
[13:23:57] <Nolski> Es0teric: er... that array still doesn't have keys
[13:24:10] <Es0teric> Nolski i was referring to the keys in the objects
[13:24:28] <Nolski> Es0teric: You just need a forEach and then a for - in loop inside of that
[13:24:39] <Es0teric> Nolski can you show me?
[13:27:06] <Nolski> Es0teric: http://pastebin.com/q1cy66uq
[13:34:57] <robertmaxrees> weee
[13:35:13] <robertmaxrees> Nolski what are you tyring to do?
[13:36:12] <robertmaxrees> also, fwiw, for (key in id) { <- this can walk the prototype chain if you're not careful.
[13:37:01] <arup_r> Why the autofocus is not happening? :/ http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/yYONmN
[13:37:29] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:37:37] <robertmaxrees> js pls ;)
[13:38:09] <arup_r> I got the  habbit :/
[13:38:19] <robertmaxrees> you're in #jquery, so we expect JS.
[13:39:23] <arup_r> I know :)
[13:39:30] <robertmaxrees> so then use it while you're here :)
[13:41:09] <acidjazz> you tell em robertmaxrees
[13:41:10] <robertmaxrees> also, .find() is for finding descendents of an element.
[13:41:28] <robertmaxrees> so $(this).find('input').focus(); doesn't really make sense in your callback.
[13:41:33] <acidjazz> descendents of all kinds and ages, RIP some
[13:42:02] <robertmaxrees> err, descendants
[13:42:03] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[13:42:54] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: Now see http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/yYONmN
[13:43:08] <arup_r> I made the HTML as per the DOM I have
[13:43:12] <arup_r> not working
[13:43:32] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:43:36] <robertmaxrees> your code doesn't make sense now.
[13:43:44] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4ou8k3x4/1/
[13:46:12] <arup_r> hre is my JS http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/yYONmN
[13:46:32] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> look at the fiddle i sent.
[13:47:05] <robertmaxrees> like, your html doesn't make sense now.
[13:47:22] <robertmaxrees> you changed the input to use the ID and then gave the parent div a class with the same name.
[13:48:09] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: I have the input inside the div and anchor outside. I have a CSS which sets display:none on the div
[13:48:32] <robertmaxrees> giving the parent class and the child id the same value doesn't make any sense.
[13:49:40] <arup_r> http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/yYONmN changed again :(
[13:49:47] <arup_r> One was class and other was ID
[13:49:48] <robertmaxrees> okay - why are you changing it?
[13:50:03] <arup_r> because that is now the exact DOM i have
[13:50:20] <robertmaxrees> so why wouldn't you send this first?
[13:50:49] <arup_r> sorry for that
[13:53:54] <n00bdev> so i have several radio buttons that hide/show inputs based on which one is chosen, everything works great except when i rerender the page when a submission failure occurs
[13:54:24] * robertmaxrees looks in his crystal ball
[13:54:26] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm.
[13:54:35] <n00bdev> the chosen radio button with the particular inputs won't open, how do i open it?
[13:54:42] <Nolski> robertmaxrees: I essentially have a 1.6 app which Is really big and making a lot of potential XSS calls that would be fixed if we were using 1.8
[13:54:47] <robertmaxrees> (you should share your code, n00bdev)
[13:54:53] <n00bdev> ok
[13:54:58] <robertmaxrees> Nolski wat
[13:55:04] <robertmaxrees> that statement doesn't make sense.
[13:55:40] <n00bdev> https://gist.github.com/gwong89/f2448e386f76cfd5e700
[13:55:52] <Nolski> robertmaxrees: what about it doesn't make sense?
[13:55:53] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:56:10] <robertmaxrees> Nolski how does 1.8+ fix "potential xss calls"?
[13:56:18] <monk3y> n00bdev: woah x 2.
[13:56:26] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev yeah, first problem here is pretty simple: notice how you're doing the same things over and over?
[13:56:39] <robertmaxrees> mind making a jsfiddle?
[13:56:42] <n00bdev> is it the document on change and ready?
[13:57:09] <robertmaxrees> it's the excessive amount of selectors and weird structure of the code.
[13:57:15] <Nolski> robertmaxrees: I believe if you pass a string of html into jquery's constructor, you can run javascript code
[13:57:31] <Nolski> And in 1.8 jquery sanatizes that input
[13:57:47] <n00bdev> robertmaxrees: yeah i know, im using jquery with ROR
[13:57:55] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev so?
[13:57:56] <Nolski> robertmaxrees: http://blog.jquery.com/2012/06/22/jquery-1-8-beta-1-see-whats-coming-and-going/ gives some details on it in the XSS section
[13:58:13] <robertmaxrees> aaah that's what you're talking about.
[13:58:20] <robertmaxrees> no server-side validation, Nolski?
[13:58:30] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev doesn't matter - your js doesn't care about your backend
[13:58:40] <n00bdev> okay
[13:58:41] <jax> hello
[13:58:50] <n00bdev> i haven't really wrote propery jquery i was kind of hacking at it
[13:58:54] <n00bdev> proper*
[13:58:57] <Nolski> robertmaxrees: what if you're pulling a hash from the URL?
[13:59:00] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev or proper JS :)
[13:59:17] <robertmaxrees> Nolski i avoid accepting user input like that without sanitizing it firs.
[13:59:19] <robertmaxrees> *first
[13:59:28] <robertmaxrees> also, always treat it as text, never as markup.
[13:59:36] <Nolski> robertmaxrees: What if your application is massive and has no front end tests?
[13:59:46] <robertmaxrees> Nolski that's... irrelevant?
[13:59:54] <n00bdev> so whats the proper style/guide??
[14:00:02] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev make that fiddle and we'll show you ;)
[14:00:09] <Nolski> robertmaxrees: No it's not?
[14:00:13] <robertmaxrees> Nolski just because there are no tests doesn't mean you should expose your end users to security risks.
[14:00:26] <robertmaxrees> what does having no front end tests have to do with not sanitizing inputs?
[14:01:47] <jax> i got control over two websites. x.com and x-online.com. x.com runs a website which integrates content form x-online.com in iframes. What are my options to control content within the iframe from x.com? i read something about allowing cross-origin access using Access-Control-Allow-Origin: x.com from x-online.com. i just want to access: iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight so i can resize the iframe dynamically
[14:02:00] <Nolski> Listen man, I didn't write the application, I'm just trying to fix it. If you're suggestion is to read through literally hundereds of thousands of lines of jquery code and then make changes in each of the places where old jQuery API's are being used incorrectly fix and then manually test them then I'd say that's a problem that can and maybe has been automated.
[14:02:07] <Nolski> robertmaxrees: ^
[14:02:19] <Nolski> Hence, why i was asking about a migration library.
[14:02:49] <robertmaxrees> uh, okay.  no need to be rude about it ;)
[14:03:07] <robertmaxrees> jax then you'll need to set those headers.
[14:03:20] <Nolski> Not trying to be rude :) just explaining my situation
[14:03:23] <monk3y> n00bdev: totally cool with the lack of experience.  You got out of that with your nick ;)  But start here for some ideas: http://lab.abhinayrathore.com/jquery-standards/
[14:03:26] <robertmaxrees> Nolski the way you were phrasing things seemed really bizarre.
[14:03:50] <jax> well i set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: x.com for the pages i'm integrating from x-online.com but still getting a security violation in chrome
[14:04:19] <jax> i also verified that this header is being sent by nginx by looking at the headers in chrome's console
[14:05:10] <robertmaxrees> jax so x.com pulls in an iframe from x-online.com?
[14:05:16] <jax> yes
[14:05:34] <jax> a page on x.com has an <iframe src="https://x-online.com/…>
[14:05:44] <robertmaxrees> and you set the proper headers for x-online.com right?
[14:05:51] <Nolski> ah robertmaxrees did the way I re-phrase it seem less bizzare?
[14:06:02] <robertmaxrees> Nolski it explains a lot.
[14:06:07] <jax> i set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: x.com for the pages served from x-online.com
[14:06:22] <jax> so browsing to x-online.com/myapp shows the headers being sent in the response
[14:06:40] <robertmaxrees> and you're using the same port and protocol, too?
[14:06:47] <robertmaxrees> what are the errors you're seeing specifically?
[14:06:54] <jax> one second
[14:07:26] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev check out learn.jquery.com btw.
[14:07:30] <robertmaxrees> lots of good info in there.
[14:07:41] <jax> actually i used * instead of x.com
[14:08:44] <robertmaxrees> so it's Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[14:08:49] <robertmaxrees> because that should work.
[14:09:21] <n00bdev> damn making a fiddle is hard
[14:09:29] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be.
[14:09:37] <robertmaxrees> you want to make a simplified version.
[14:09:42] <robertmaxrees> so don' give me the whole page.
[14:09:53] <robertmaxrees> just an example of your core issue.
[14:11:14] <jax> do i have to provide protocol too in allow-access-origin?
[14:11:22] <jax> Uncaught DOMException: Blocked a frame with origin "https://www.x.com" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
[14:11:36] <robertmaxrees> * is valid
[14:11:55] <jax> is what i get when i try to do: e = document.getElementById('my-iframe') then do: e.contentWindow.document
[14:12:11] <robertmaxrees> so you have foo.com - it's loading an iframe from bar.com - you set the header on bar.com, right?
[14:12:23] <jax> yes
[14:12:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that should be fine.
[14:14:45] <jax> guess i'll just use the window.postMessage approach
[14:15:13] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer
[14:15:14] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[14:21:07] <n00bdev> https://jsfiddle.net/nvfs5c0r/4/#update
[14:21:12] <n00bdev> so as you see
[14:21:14] <n00bdev> on page load
[14:21:21] <n00bdev> it wont load the inputs
[14:21:39] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[14:21:49] <robertmaxrees> use label tags and wrap them around the radios btw.
[14:22:22] <n00bdev> okie
[14:22:39] <robertmaxrees> also: event delegation is a good thing.
[14:23:00] <n00bdev> never heard of that term before
[14:23:01] <n00bdev> lol
[14:24:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nvfs5c0r/6/
[14:24:29] <robertmaxrees> but this is still kind of weird.
[14:25:29] <acidjazz> whats the best way to handle cookies
[14:25:36] <acidjazz> that old jquery plugin
[14:25:39] <NoiseEee> right down the ol' gullet
[14:25:53] <NoiseEee> what does 'handle cookies' mean?
[14:26:09] <acidjazz> create/read/erase
[14:26:10] <acidjazz> cookies
[14:26:12] <acidjazz> n/m
[14:26:34] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev a little better: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nvfs5c0r/8/
[14:27:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd also abstract out the code to actually react to the thing that was clicked instead of checking everything like it is now.
[14:27:48] <jax> thx robertmaxrees
[14:28:17] <n00bdev> thx robertmaxrees!
[14:28:21] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev one sec.
[14:28:27] <robertmaxrees> let me show you the basics for the next step.
[14:28:29] <n00bdev> im primarily a backend guy
[14:28:37] <robertmaxrees> it shows :)
[14:32:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nvfs5c0r/9/
[14:33:15] <robertmaxrees> taking that a step further.
[14:33:53] <n00bdev> WOW
[14:34:10] <n00bdev> just one caveat, the form doesnt load
[14:34:16] <robertmaxrees> yep, fixing that now ;)
[14:36:41] <n00bdev> im seriously impressed by the reduction of lines
[14:38:26] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nvfs5c0r/11/
[14:38:29] <robertmaxrees> there.
[14:38:41] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to fix the subitem stuff from before.
[14:38:46] <robertmaxrees> but this should give you a good place to start.
[14:39:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nvfs5c0r/12/ touch more efficient.
[14:41:58] <n00bdev> sorry what subitem are you referring to?
[14:52:09] <robertmaxrees> when you open a group and enable/disable those.
[14:54:24] <n00bdev> so lookin at your code
[14:54:41] <n00bdev> the return this.checked is causing the appending
[14:55:40] <n00bdev> nvm ill think about it and play around and see what happens
[15:19:49] <Username_> $.each(['a'], function($){return ({'a':'b'}).getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj,$)});
[15:19:54] <Username_> whats the bind equivalent to that?
[15:24:10] <esaym153> can I have $(document).ready() in many places throught a single page?
[15:24:39] <beanHolez> What is the fastest way to find an arbitrary node in the entire DOM? I have a system where a bunch of modules have individual selectors defined, and a manager that handles all those modules. The manager has an infinite loop that needs to check the module selectors against the DOM to see if those elements have appeared.
[15:25:10] <beanHolez> @esaym153 , yes
[15:26:43] <beanHolez> essentially I need to do: while (true) { /* is the element on the page yet? */ } as efficiently as possible
[15:29:56] <claytonzaugg> so I'm trying to set a speed to an animation if the browswer is > ie9, but if it is ie9, I want there to be zero speed.  How is my ternary incorrect? var gifAnimation = $(!'.ie9') ? 3000 : 0;
[15:31:46] <claytonzaugg> How about this, is this syntax correct if it finds a class .ie9 to set the variable to 3000 and 0 if it's bnot present: var gifAnimation = $(!'.ie9') ? 3000 : 0;
[15:35:15] <claytonzaugg> or how would you do a ternary if a class is present, do something, otherwise do something else? How do you check for the class?
[15:40:43] <claytonzaugg> anyone?
[15:42:51] <based_pdev> so your question is, how do you get a boolean value for checking a selector?
[15:42:57] <based_pdev> why dont you google it
[15:43:28] <claytonzaugg> ...that's the phrase I needed to know to search for.  Thanks!
[15:43:36] <based_pdev> np :)
[15:47:10] <n00bdev> hey robertmaxrees
[15:47:23] <n00bdev> https://jsfiddle.net/nvfs5c0r/13/
[15:47:32] <n00bdev> is yours more efficient?
[15:47:38] <n00bdev> th v12 version
[15:47:42] <n00bdev> compared to this
[15:49:22] <ashgotti> Hello everyone. I don't think I'm using the right syntax for doing something like this 'this[id*='1st']' I'm trying to check if $(this)'s ID contains a specific string
[15:52:39] <claytonzaugg> based_pdev, I found my solution.  Thank you! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/299802/how-do-you-check-if-a-selector-matches-something-in-jquery
[16:46:52] <n00bdev> anyone here
[16:47:07] <robertmaxrees> over 650 people
[16:47:16] <n00bdev> hey robert
[16:47:51] <n00bdev> do you mind clarifying me some things really quick
[16:48:00] <robertmaxrees> sure
[16:48:02] <n00bdev> https://jsfiddle.net/nvfs5c0r/13/
[16:48:16] <n00bdev> so this is one of the fiddles u helped me with
[16:48:27] <n00bdev> $this.data
[16:48:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah?
[16:48:47] <n00bdev> does it mean the data for the inputgroup from the radio buttons?
[16:49:16] <robertmaxrees> so 'this' is the element you interacted with.
[16:49:25] <n00bdev> okay right
[16:49:31] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the jquery-fied version of that element.
[16:49:41] <robertmaxrees> $(this).data('somekey') would be off of that element.
[16:49:47] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think? :)
[16:50:56] <n00bdev> is that why you put data-inputgroup in the radio buttons>
[16:51:06] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:51:11] <robertmaxrees> that allows us to relate things that way.
[16:51:31] <n00bdev> ok that makes sense
[16:51:38] <n00bdev> what if i have nested radio buttons within those
[16:51:53] <robertmaxrees> within what?
[16:52:12] <n00bdev> so on field price or tender
[16:52:22] <n00bdev> you'll see 2 radio buttons, 1 selected by default
[16:52:27] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle to show me what you're talking about.
[16:52:49] <n00bdev> its already updated
[16:52:56] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/nvfs5c0r/15/
[16:53:00] <robertmaxrees> what you had was a little weird.
[16:53:24] <robertmaxrees> so the code i gave you is really only good for part of the page.
[16:53:40] <robertmaxrees> so if you'd like to change the functionality elsewhere, tackle that separately.
[16:53:58] <n00bdev> okay
[16:54:24] <n00bdev> im asking how to approach actually
[16:54:40] <n00bdev> in tender/price
[16:54:56] <n00bdev> there are 2 radio buttons that also depending on which 1 is chosen, renders that form
[16:55:04] <robertmaxrees> *shows btw.
[16:55:06] <robertmaxrees> not "renders"
[16:55:13] <n00bdev> shows*
[16:55:21] <robertmaxrees> and you could apply a similar methodology to those.
[16:55:40] <n00bdev> would i nest that into the hideorshowinput function?
[16:55:45] <n00bdev> or define a new function seperatly?
[16:56:09] <robertmaxrees> hold up - why'd you ditch the filter function i gave you?
[16:56:32] <robertmaxrees> and you could abstract out that hideorshow setup a little more if you wanted, or do a new handler.
[16:56:33] <n00bdev> it was appending everytime i clicked on a different button
[16:56:46] <robertmaxrees> easy fix.
[16:57:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nvfs5c0r/16/
[16:57:14] <n00bdev> i was staring at it for awhile... still couldnt really figure it out
[16:57:46] <robertmaxrees> it wasn't hiding things the way it should.
[16:58:46] <n00bdev> why is this better than the one i just posted?
[16:58:51] <robertmaxrees> abstraction.
[16:58:57] <robertmaxrees> no need for that weird .bind() call.
[16:59:51] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nvfs5c0r/17/ with some more abstraction.
[17:05:06] <n00bdev> so
[17:05:32] <n00bdev> the div inputgroup matches the active element key and shows that field?
[17:07:56] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[17:09:07] <n00bdev> and you use the dot to specify the specific element class correct?
[17:09:59] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:24:05] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev have you checked out learn.jquery.com ?
[17:26:35] <n00bdev> i haven't gone through the chapters, but i definitly will
[17:31:43] <n00bdev> https://jsfiddle.net/97dj07mq/
[17:32:00] <n00bdev> my attempt
[17:33:00] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you should wrap label tags around the radio/span combos
[17:33:57] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with console.log()?
[17:34:45] <robertmaxrees> also - <div class="tender inputgroup sub-radio-row"> vs $('.subRadioRow')
[17:35:28] <n00bdev> yea im familiar
[17:35:47] <robertmaxrees> that's really helpful in these cases :)
[17:36:14] <robertmaxrees> console.log($fieldToShow) in hideOrShowFields was empty
[17:36:50] <robertmaxrees> wound up being that your selector in $subRadioRow was bad.
[17:37:22] <n00bdev> do i have to specify a new div the radio buttons?
[17:37:30] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:39:02] <robertmaxrees> you just need to change the selector to match what's on the divs.
[17:39:24] <n00bdev> ohhh i made a super noob mistake
[17:39:25] <n00bdev> shiet
[17:39:28] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:40:08] <robertmaxrees> that's why i pasted that opening div tag and the selecotr.
[17:40:11] <robertmaxrees> *selector
[17:40:20] <n00bdev> awwww yiss it works
[17:40:39] <n00bdev> my appreciation for jquery grows
[17:53:36] <luvmyh0nda> Hi! Is there a way that i can programmatically set the location of the steps for the jquery ui slider?
[17:54:46] <n00bdev> jk doesnt relly 100% work
[17:59:23] <n00bdev> robert how do i handle multiple?
[17:59:38] <n00bdev> so i found out the error
[18:00:55] <n00bdev> since i have 2 default selected radios in 2 of subrows, and console.log returns only 1, and if i go the the radio button with the field thats not returned, it renders nothing until i click another radio button in that subfield
[18:48:25] <n00bdev> anyone know what cannot read property data of undefined means?
[19:12:27] <zumba_addict> good evening folks, is this native to jquery? $.when.apply($, promises).then(function() { .....

[23:21:00] <Cork> n00bdev: what line are you talking about?
[23:22:21] <n00bdev> var $fieldToShow
[23:22:42] <n00bdev> $activeField returns a jquery object that has 2 elements selected by default
[23:22:55] <n00bdev> but the $fieldToShow only returns one of them
[23:23:59] <Cork> n00bdev: to start of line 38 and 31 can be simplified to .find('input:checked')
[23:24:07] <Cork> *28, 31
[23:24:41] <Cork> n00bdev: and .data only returns the string from the first matched field
[23:24:55] <Cork> if you want to get the selectors from all the inputs you need to collect them first
[23:25:08] <n00bdev> doesn't filter collect them all?
[23:25:22] <Cork> filter collects the fields, sure
[23:25:30] <Cork> but .data only returns from the first field
[23:25:40] <n00bdev> okay
[23:25:44] <n00bdev> how do i return both?
[23:26:15] <Cork> n00bdev: https://jsfiddle.net/97dj07mq/6/
[23:26:41] <Cork> (you need to do the same on line 4)
[23:27:55] <n00bdev> why does 4 need to be same
[23:28:14] <n00bdev> since theres no default selection should it not matter?
[23:28:40] <Cork> cause it does .data('value')
[23:28:48] <Cork> so it will filter out the first element in the set
[23:29:00] <Cork> ?api data
[23:29:00] <b-ot> Cork: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[23:29:42] <Cork> "Return the value at the named data store for the first element in the jQuery collection"
[23:38:42] <n00bdev> Cork: still not working
[23:38:53] <n00bdev> i appreciate your help though
[23:39:43] <n00bdev> if im on tender and change one of the sub-radio buttons and go to price, the inputs for price should be displayed but its not
[23:40:01] <n00bdev> it only displays after i change the radio button
[23:40:03] <Cork> n00bdev: what isn't working with http://jsfiddle.net/97dj07mq/7/ ?
[23:40:33] <n00bdev> ok so
[23:40:42] <n00bdev> lets say youre on button tender
[23:40:46] <n00bdev> and u switch to price
[23:40:58] <n00bdev> see how price sub-radio is selected but no input is shown?
[23:41:12] <n00bdev> im trying to fix that part
[23:41:34] <Cork> check the values in the html
[23:41:38] <Cork> it is most likely the cause
[23:41:50] <Cork> cause it is just price that isn't working
[23:42:28] <Cork> well offers looks a bit bork too
[23:43:08] <Cork> but when you go to auction it works fine
[23:43:08] <Cork> and that tells me it most likely isn't the coe
[23:43:08] <Cork> *code
[23:43:41] <n00bdev> well aunction works because theres no subradio button
[23:44:20] <WG1337> Hi! I want to change a text inside google gauge, but it doesnt seem to work. $("#chart-div3 svg g g text:first").text("Off");     Am I missing something? Are there some kind of limitations for SVG?
[23:45:41] <hellyeah> yo yo yo
[23:46:57] <Cork> n00bdev: ah
[23:47:08] <n00bdev> i doubt its value
[23:47:11] <Cork> n00bdev: well you build a static list of subRadioRow
[23:47:27] <Cork> and then you select all checked values in this collection
[23:47:35] <Cork> but if the field is hidden or not doesn't matter
[23:47:40] <Cork> it is still checked
[23:48:11] <n00bdev> right
[23:48:49] <n00bdev> one of the fields is shown, but other doesnt show when i switch in main radio button
[23:48:56] <n00bdev> even with sub-radio button checked
[23:54:21] <n00bdev> cork: so whats the fix?
[23:54:26] <n00bdev> Cork*
