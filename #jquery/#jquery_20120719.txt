[00:00:07] <sente> azbyin: all i did was search StackOverflow for your question
[00:00:10] <sente> and then followed a link
[00:00:15] <sente> and pasted a few links to you
[00:00:25] <sente> azbyin: i have no clue... i spent all of ~10 seconds looking at what i linked ya ;)
[00:00:34] <azbyin> yes, i know. it appears to have been on SO and upshots
[00:00:43] <sente> upshots? wazzat?
[00:00:51] <azbyin> i just want to know if there was a license associated with that bit of code
[00:01:06] <azbyin> upshots.org   one of the links you posted is frm there as well
[00:01:16] <sente> azbyin: there was a git repo mentioned in the second link
[00:01:19] <sente> go tehre and find out?
[00:01:22] <sente> ah, heh
[00:01:26] <sente> see, shows you how much attention i paid ;)
[00:03:30] <azbyin> http://jsperf.com/copycss-vs-mine
[00:03:42] <azbyin> seems to suggest that this other bit of code is much faster that copycss
[00:03:42] <rmill> ALL OF DEH LIGHTS
[00:03:49] <azbyin> anyway, i 'm not after performance
[00:04:45] <rmill> azbyin: good for you, performance is completely overrated!
[00:05:04] <rmill> except in production.
[00:11:21] <sente> even in production, usually, in the context of #jquery
[00:12:30] <coldhead> no one will ever visit our sites anyway, so it doesn't REALLY matter
[00:12:37] <coldhead> people only use facebook now
[00:12:48] <sente> coldhead--
[00:13:02] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[00:13:05] <coldhead> i don't make the rules
[00:13:50] <sente> there are no rules, that's the beauty of freedom
[00:14:41] <coldhead> the freedom to choose facebook
[00:14:43] <coldhead> :(
[00:14:54] <sente> somehow i found a bunch of other options
[00:15:09] <sente> as i very rarely use facebook
[00:15:25] <sente> but spend 8+ hours a day on the web / doing programming for the web
[00:15:30] <fairuz> Hi guys, is there any maximum file size can be loaded using jquery .json()? Thanks
[00:15:53] <sente> fairuz: if there is, it is a lot larger than you'd reasonably want
[00:15:59] <sente> fairuz: in other words, No
[00:16:51] <sente> fairuz: but you should probably break the data up so the user experience doesn't suck
[00:17:02] <fairuz> sente: I'm asking because right now I'm using jQuery flot to draw graph. I have no problem doing graphs with small json files. But with 6MB json file, it just stops working. (not drawing the graph)
[00:17:19] <fairuz> So I'm wondering where is the bottleneck
[00:17:22] <sente> fairuz: i've loaded much larger files than 6MB
[00:17:42] <sente> fairuz: can you link me?
[00:17:50] <fairuz> sente: Glad to hear that. With flot? Or for something else?
[00:18:07] <sente> with many other things
[00:18:22] <some_dude> Whirl3d: I don't need to delay it , it's just that 10 mousover events get triggered and I only wanna run one animation.
[00:18:24] <sente> i've used flot a bit, but don't recall if i've loaded big datasets with it
[00:18:38] <sente> fairuz: can you link?
[00:20:12] <fairuz> sente: Ok I need to setup the link for public, then I send it here.
[00:20:16] <fairuz> It's local now
[00:28:22] <fairuz> sente: My bad. I just tried with the most basic graph and it works with 6MB json file.
[00:28:41] <sente> fairuz: fairuz :)
[00:28:43] <fairuz> Maybe it's my bad code.
[00:29:04] <fairuz> Hmm but it is still weird because the same code works for small files. :)
[00:29:14] <sente> well if your code is bad, then i wouldn't be surprised
[00:29:48] <fairuz> I don't quite sure what is wrong but I strongly suspected my own code. :)
[00:29:59] <sente> if only you could share the code
[00:30:00] <sente> if only
[00:30:01] <sente> ;)
[00:31:10] * coldhead np: come - shoot me first
[00:31:24] <fairuz> Sure I can. Nothing secret about it (javascript based tools anyway,  people can see my code), but need to upload that somewhere first and I'm in the middle of something else.
[00:31:33] <sente> nod
[00:34:09] <sente> fairuz: why did you choose flot?
[00:40:09] <coldhead> flot comes with a cool text file of documentation
[00:41:39] <sente> fair enough
[00:41:57] <fairuz> sente: No particular reason. Do you want to suggest other tool? My only concern is to handle a lot of points. (around 1 millions of points)
[00:42:11] <fairuz> coldhead: The one file API.txt? :)
[00:42:16] <coldhead> yup :)
[00:42:31] <sente> fairuz: i'd happily peak at it and stuff, if i could see your data
[00:43:02] <sente> zip foo.zip your_stuff/*.*; curl -F 'foo.zip=@foo.zip' c.sente.cc
[00:43:08] <sente> if you're on linux that'll send it to me
[00:43:11] <sente> or a mac
[00:43:17] <sente> (if you care)
[00:43:33] <sente> also http://sentedrop.com/upload
[00:43:59] <coldhead> you are one connected dude, sente++
[00:46:09] <circlicious> can you help me with this - http://jsfiddle.net/kuSCq/1/ ?
[00:47:12] <sente> coldhead: yeah i hate waiting, basically
[00:47:19] <fairuz> sente: Sure give me a few minutes. Someone in my office. :)
[00:47:54] <sente> also, i do a ridiculous amount of data downloading/transferring, it's only reasonable
[00:48:04] <tw2113> circlicious it helps to explain your intent
[00:48:14] <circlicious> ?
[00:48:24] <tw2113> what are you trying to accomplish
[00:48:57] <sente> and more importantly, when'd you first get into circles?
[00:49:12] <circlicious> hard to explain, cant even show you :( basically i am using jquery ui for resizing, and it has an iframe beside the resizing handle. sometimes when i resize to fast and move mouse of iframe, it suddenly shrinks in size - tweitter
[00:49:19] <circlicious> oh sorry, tw2113
[00:49:57] <circlicious> so i thought i would trigger mousemove event and resize the iframe back to its original size
[00:50:00] <circlicious> do i make sense?
[00:50:15] <circlicious> not trigger, i mean catch
[00:50:26] <tw2113> all i see is a fiddle with jsfiddle.net in an iframe
[00:50:35] <tw2113> and trying to alert when clicked
[00:51:04] <circlicious> ya i just wanna find how i can capture click event (basically i wanna do that with mousemove)
[00:51:08] <circlicious> but for a testcase i came up with that
[00:51:16] <circlicious> i saw some stackoverflow answers none helps
[00:51:39] <coldhead> i'm not sure you can bubble events from an iframe into the parent, circlicious
[00:51:53] <sente> you're not supposed to be able to
[00:51:58] <coldhead> i can see people saying to put a transparent div over the iframe
[00:52:01] <coldhead> which please kill me
[00:52:14] <circlicious> ya i do that
[00:52:20] * sente sends coldhead back to the safety of facebook
[00:52:24] <circlicious> that fixes a part of the problem
[00:52:29] <circlicious> the other part is iframe size shrinking :|
[00:53:12] <tw2113> set height/width attributes?
[00:54:01] <circlicious> funny those answers marked right on SO are wrong, doesnt works.
[00:54:09] <circlicious> i guess they just did that for points
[00:54:34] <tw2113> oh stackoverflow
[00:56:47] <coldhead> you so crazy
[00:56:58] <tw2113> oh stop, you
[00:59:23] <horrror> does Facebook images popup is an iframe? or a simple js modal window?
[00:59:51] <sente> very lkely modal
[00:59:57] <sente> very easy to test
[01:00:06] <circlicious> lol
[01:00:19] <coldhead> no need to test, i'll create an account and test for you
[01:00:38] <coldhead> Eviltwin would know, he's working for That Man
[01:00:48] <sente> coldhead: i'd know if i gave a damn
[01:00:51] <coldhead> it's asking my date of birth
[01:00:56] <coldhead> DOES ANYONE KNOW MY DATE OF BIRTH
[01:01:04] <sente> just open up dev console and type  $('iframe')
[01:01:07] <coldhead> hang on, i'll call mom
[01:01:07] <tw2113> tomorrow, coldhead
[01:01:22] <tw2113> you're not born yet
[01:01:24] <coldhead> OH GOD SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
[01:01:29] <coldhead> SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER
[01:01:32] <coldhead> DAMN YOU FACEBOOK

[01:02:29] <sente> b-ot: i love marriedtothesea
[01:02:39] <tw2113> SHOUT LOUDER COLDHEAD
[01:02:44] <coldhead> capslock is for the faint of heart
[01:02:54] <coldhead> IT TAKES DEDICATION TO HOLD SHIFT
[01:03:02] <tw2113> capslock is for those who only have 4 fingers per hand
[01:03:06] <tw2113> no pinkies
[01:03:17] <coldhead> or to M-u all over the line retrospectively
[01:03:29] <mindis|wurk> caps lock is cruise control for cool
[01:03:31] <coldhead> OR TO M-U ALL OVER THE LINE RETROSPECTIVELY

[01:06:20] <sente> you need to be full out robotrippin within the hour or i'm going to be disappointing
[01:06:25] <sente> and disappointed
[01:10:01] <coldhead> i'm still at the office and out of meds
[01:10:07] <coldhead> i guess i'll just have to go home soon

[01:20:18] <Grundell> Hello
[01:21:00] <Grundell> I want to show first li hide the others with same class name and then be able to "show / expandthem down "
[01:22:19] <coldhead> $('.someclass:nth-child(1)').show().nextAll().hide();
[01:22:22] <coldhead> that's the first part
[01:22:39] <coldhead> the show/expand mechanics depend on how you want to do them
[01:22:47] <Grundell> coldhead okay... and the second part ?
[01:23:06] <coldhead> probably gonna need to see your code
[01:23:29] <sente> Grundell: don't believe his lies
[01:23:50] <Grundell> coldhead okay - i want the li to expand down...
[01:23:53] <sente> if you want real feedback don't show us what you got so far
[01:24:16] <Grundell> sente - please explain
[01:28:25] <coldhead> at a guess maybe you want $('li.someclass:nth-child(1)').mouseover(function () {$(this).nextAll().slideDown();});
[01:31:27] <sente> Grundell: sarcasm
[01:31:46] <jepster> is there any possibility to adjust the volume of the browser with jquery?
[01:31:59] <jepster> audio volume *
[01:32:16] <sente> god i hope not
[01:32:44] <Grundell> Coldhead - okay how is it with on click of a button ?
[01:33:08] <coldhead> it depends on your html, Grundell
[01:33:16] <coldhead> i'm sorry :(
[01:33:37] <Grundell> Okay... give me two seconds and ill have show you
[01:33:53] <coldhead> i will try to remain interested
[01:34:31] <sente> see any good marsupials as of late, coldhead?
[01:35:29] <coldhead> sadly not
[01:35:31] <Grundell> 'http://pastebin.com/m43CkzbN - cold head. thats the code, i want to hide everyone but the first li
[01:35:53] <coldhead> yes but where are the buttons you speak of?
[01:35:58] <Grundell> cold head and on toggle translations i want to show all and i want them to slide down :)
[01:36:20] <Grundell> Far bottom - see all translations line 31
[01:36:34] <Grundell> Oh sorry missed an end div on that one
[01:37:36] <coldhead> $('.js-toggle-translations').click(function () {$('.trns-seq-item').slideToggle();});
[01:39:00] <jpic> hi all, can anybody confirm that dropping an item on a tab *header* works on http://pub.yourlabs.org/sortable-working.html but not on http://pub.yourlabs.org/sortable-broken.html ? The difference is that .connectedSortable div has no width in sortable-broken.html ... is it a bug ? can anybody confirm this pls ?
[01:39:29] <Grundell> coldhead, thats the second part ?
[01:39:47] <coldhead> Grundell: possibly! i hope so!
[01:39:59] <coldhead> it's your project, you're the best judge
[01:40:14] <Grundell> haha okay let me try and well see
[01:40:18] <coldhead> i don't really care for multilingual websites
[01:40:24] <jpic> I'm fairly convinced it's a bug
[01:40:32] <coldhead> i took the trouble to learn english, i don't see why everyone else shouldn't
[01:40:59] <Grundell> coldhead - well this is a mockup for a translation application that im making
[01:41:30] <coldhead> best of luck, Grundell
[01:41:34] <coldhead> a noble cause
[01:45:11] <Grundell> coldhead - thanks :D
[01:46:28] <coldhead> and on that bombshell
[01:48:56] * sente confirms for no reason: http://c.sente.cc/3ThB/abc.html
[01:49:22] <Grundell> coldhead - sorry, I'm actually in a phone call trying to reason with my Girl friend...
[01:49:32] <Grundell> spelling is awesome today

[01:55:25] <theere> hey, I am using .hover to show a countdown thing from http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html, but how do I "undo" the counter display when i unhover?
[01:55:44] <theere> like is there some easy way to put back the information i lost -_-?
[02:01:48] <shoky_> don't lose it
[02:12:04] <fairuz> sente: still there?
[02:12:15] <sente> yeah
[02:12:23] <fairuz> I'm uploading my test case
[02:12:37] <fairuz> sente: flot.zip2.6MB
[02:12:43] <fairuz> Using your upload site
[02:13:06] <fairuz> Thanks for your time :) Very appreciate it
[02:13:16] <fairuz> In the you can find several json files
[02:13:26] <fairuz> The one which is big is 2.json
[02:14:22] <xananax> hello
[02:14:24] <xananax> Any idea why $(el).fadeTo(20000,.8) does not use my duration? wether I use 10000 or 20000 or 50000 it always seems to use 1 second
[02:14:36] <veebers> Hi all, can anyone suggest an efficient way to create hundreds of li elements?
[02:14:43] <veebers> an example of what I'm doing here: http://jsfiddle.net/ahxBZ/2/
[02:15:07] <veebers> the first click takes about 8ms, any click after that takes ~500-800ms
[02:16:11] <sente> fairuz: got it up
[02:18:31] <dogmatic69> veebers: how is this? http://jsfiddle.net/FhPBY/
[02:19:45] <veebers> dogmatic69: hey wow, cheers
[02:19:57] <veebers> I would have thought that storing that in a variable would be quicker
[02:20:04] <veebers> minus another lookup?
[02:20:13] <fairuz> sente: Do you know what's wrong? I lack of ideas :D
[02:20:26] <dogmatic69> its just redundant code, no point storing something you use once
[02:20:48] <dagerik> if I add stuff with $(window.document).ready(callback), which order are the functions run?
[02:21:57] <veebers> dogmatic69: cool. thanks for that

[02:24:05] <fairuz> sente: I don't see the graph here.
[02:24:23] <fairuz> I don't know if you can see it.
[02:25:51] <sente> javascript error?
[02:25:55] <sente> line 75?
[02:27:03] <sente> regardless of which json
[02:27:21] <fairuz> That is from the flot example. IIRC, I don't touch that particular area.
[02:27:28] <fairuz> sente: What is the error?
[02:28:11] <beakybal4> hey
[02:28:29] <keirlav87> does chrome not give you a detailed view of your post and get requests the way firebug does in the console?
[02:28:40] <beakybal4> keirlav87: yeah it does
[02:28:46] <sente> fairuz: http://i.imgur.com/svwZv.png
[02:28:47] <febley> Hi there, i've got a table and every row (tr) in the table needs a additional class. I've tried to add the class with this script, but it doesn't work:
[02:28:48] <febley> #content tr
[02:28:51] <beakybal4> chek the network tab
[02:28:55] <sente> keirlav87: yes
[02:28:57] <febley> $("#content tr").addClass("row");
[02:29:56] <keirlav87> ahh thank you, i was looking in console, too used to firebug i guess
[02:32:47] <fairuz> sente: Maybe I construct my dataset incorrectly? Or the example (flot/examples/tracking.html) already has this error?
[02:33:30] <beakybal4> hi, when i click "lint" on this jsfiddle I get an error and I don't know what it means

[02:43:10] <mindis|wurk> beakybal4 it should probably be something like $(this).contents().find(".listMruBody")

[02:48:58] <sente> because of range issues and who knows what else
[02:49:06] <fairuz> sente: Does dygraph have zooming + tracking feature?
[02:49:21] <sente> clearly you haven't tried to zoom
[02:49:25] <fairuz> Just see that it has with your first example! This is nice
[02:49:28] <fairuz> :)
[02:49:56] <sente> yup
[02:50:06] <sente> dygraph is go-to for shit when i want something in 5 minutes
[02:50:28] <sente> so what are the spikes in your data
[02:50:42] <fairuz> This is good. I will try to use it. So you think there is nothing wrong with my dataset format?
[02:50:58] <sente> http://i.imgur.com/eR3gA.png
[02:51:03] <sente> i circled them, in case you couldn't find them
[02:51:16] <sente> i mean, its your data
[02:51:39] <sente> it's represented fine though
[02:51:51] <fairuz> Some cache misses when you swipe your phone
[02:58:26] <sente> your data is messed,kinda
[02:58:33] <sente> well, no
[02:58:39] <sente> 2.json is just a diff form
[03:00:12] <sente> http://fairuz.y.sente.cc/foo2.html
[03:00:53] <sente> not look at the source, note i'm using a csv file now
[03:00:55] <sente> way simpler
[03:00:56] <sente> smaller
[03:01:01] <sente> overall less obnoxious in every way
[03:08:58] <MichMich_> guys, question. If I select $("ul").find(".active")... how can I see which index this object has within the UL?
[03:18:32] <mindis|wurk> boohoo. i hate z-index conflicts with fadein
[03:29:41] <Grundell> Coldhead - still there
[03:51:37] <fairuz> sente, sorriy going out for lunch. Wait I see your example
[03:52:22] <fairuz> Before using json, I used csv too.
[03:52:31] <fairuz> But that  is just for doing graphs in excel
[03:52:53] <fairuz> I see people use json for flot, so that's why I change my output format to json
[03:52:56] <sente> fairuz: well, your json jsut represnts a set of X,Y points
[03:53:03] <sente> so a csv file does the trick as well
[03:53:07] <fairuz> sente : Correct
[03:53:15] <sente> it doesn't matter when your data is simple like this
[03:53:26] <sente> but its a lot easier to trim /debug with a csv
[03:54:00] <diverdude> Is it possible to put code inside a script tag with src attribute set? Like <script type="text/javascript" src="url">code here</script> ?
[03:54:27] <fairuz> But later if I want to add 2-3 graphs, it will be the same?
[03:54:39] <sente> what do you mean?
[03:55:08] <fairuz> Let say I have 3 datasets
[03:55:24] <fairuz> but each dataset is always x,y points
[03:56:13] <sente> okay
[03:56:28] <fairuz> It is still possible I suppose?
[03:57:12] <fairuz> To draw each dataset in the same window or to draw each in different window with shared X axe
[04:01:29] <sente> well
[04:03:07] <sente> i'm looking
[04:06:09] <sente> http://jsfiddle.net/api/post/jquery/1.4/
[04:06:56] <sunbeam> a form, with several <fieldsets>, each fieldset is used as a div content holder, is this allowed? or a form containing several divs?
[04:08:05] <Kingsy> scrollTop: jQuery(".nav-container").offset().top <--- how do you scroll to the bottom of an element ?
[04:08:09] <Kingsy> scrollBottom ?
[04:11:28] <sunbeam> why do checkboxes need a value?
[04:11:31] <sunbeam> and not just a name
[04:11:49] <EnginA> have you guys used extjs ?
[04:14:23] <daslicht> how do you guy maintain the ability to get Single interface pages indexable?
[04:15:04] <daslicht> i saw a backbone titorial where he just create anything twice (php / js template) but this seems to be less smart
[04:15:53] <daslicht> another approch which I have found is to hickjack teh content (links) and replace the recent if js is availabel
[04:18:37] <Kingsy> nope I just cant get this working.. anyone got some advice ?
[04:19:31] <dogmatic69> Kingsy: top() + height() ?
[04:19:41] <dogmatic69> bottom() ?
[04:20:59] <Kingsy> huh? so scrollTop: jQuery(".nav-container").offset().top().height() ?
[04:21:02] <Kingsy> that will return an error
[04:21:32] <dogmatic69> +
[04:22:04] <Kingsy> dogmatic69: sorry I don't know what you mean.. can you show me the line ?
[04:22:35] <dogmatic69> nvm, try this $("#myDiv").attr({ scrollTop: $("#myDiv").attr("scrollHeight") });
[04:23:52] <Kingsy> dogmatic69: nope does ntohing (doesnt scroll at all) this is what I have --> jQuery('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: jQuery(".nav-container").attr("scrollHeight") }, 'slow');
[04:24:11] <dogmatic69> replace .attr with .prop
[04:24:56] <Kingsy> dogmatic69: that now scrolls but not where I want it to
[04:25:12] <dogmatic69> why you adding html, body...
[04:25:20] <dogmatic69> $("#myDiv").animate({ scrollTop: $("#myDiv").prop("scrollHeight") }, 3000);
[04:25:50] <Kingsy> would that make a difference?
[04:26:58] <mink> What is the best way to check checkbox with click in div? --> http://jsfiddle.net/z8jSf/
[04:27:07] <Kingsy> dogmatic69: --> jQuery('.nav-container').animate({ scrollTop: jQuery(".nav-container").prop("scrollHeight") }, 'slow'); <-- doesnt scroll at all now
[04:27:10] <mink> I do it but when I click on checkbox, script works fail :(

[04:27:43] <Grundell> The life aquatic :D
[04:27:54] <Grundell> Any how :)
[04:28:10] <Grundell> How ever have a question.
[04:28:36] <Kingsy> I don't know what your talking about sorry :P
[04:28:55] <Kingsy> dogmatic69: so anyways.. can you see what I am missing ?

[04:30:12] <mink> dogmatic69 ?
[04:30:48] <dogmatic69> click in the div.
[04:31:07] <mink> dogmatic69, how uncheckbox ? :)
[04:31:15] <Kingsy> i cant beleive its so hard to scroll to the bottom of an element.. when its so easy to scroll to the top of one
[04:31:30] <dogmatic69> mink: if(checked) {uncheck} eles {check)
[04:32:07] <Grundell> I was going to ask if any one could help me with a simple problem... i have a page where i want the li to show the first post and on click i want it to expand... This is the code... assume it's really easy though since im really new to jQuerry id don't really know how to.... (this is the html markup http://pastebin.com/AH7w08J1)
[04:32:29] <Grundell> Would love a little help if any one thinks they have 5 minutes to spare
[04:32:39] <dogmatic69> mink: http://jsfiddle.net/z8jSf/2/
[04:33:04] <dogmatic69> Grundell: why not use jquery UI accordian?
[04:33:23] <Famic> is there a way to target :before pseudo elements ?
[04:33:55] <dogmatic69> $('.foo').before()
[04:33:59] <Grundell> dogmatic69 since im really really new to jQuery i don't really know how to :) ?
[04:34:21] <dogmatic69> Grundell: so open up the jquery UI demo and see. It provides the code for you
[04:34:22] <mindis|wurk> i don't think that's what .before() does
[04:34:34] <Famic> dogmatic69: not at all
[04:34:43] <Famic> Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements.
[04:34:54] <mink> dogmatic69, thanks for help, but try click on checkbox please (:    And this is my problem what I ask :)
[04:35:17] <mink> on click on checkbox, function to check checkbox executes two times
[04:35:30] <Grundell> dogmatic69 - well i assume there is a simple line and i don't really want to search for it for 1 hour to find the "right way to do it "
[04:36:09] <dogmatic69> google + one minute == code
[04:36:48] <Grundell> well actually i googled it, the problem is that its different class names in all the examples...
[04:37:28] <Grundell> I want the first list item of the same class show and the others to hide untill you press show
[04:37:31] <dogmatic69> mink: http://jsfiddle.net/z8jSf/3/
[04:37:35] <Kingsy> ok scrap this.. is it possible to scroll to a certain number of pixels from the top of the screen ?
[04:38:01] <mindis|wurk> Famic if you meant the :before elements you create with css then i'm pretty sure the answer is no since those don't really exist in the DOM. besides, what exactly would happen if you didn't have css? :P
[04:38:43] <Famic> mindis|wurk: I'm afraid you're right, pseudo elements can't be selected by jquery. That's too bad because I wanted js to alter their css properties
[04:39:16] <thomedy> okay this isnt  a question of please fix me it is a question of what is the difference between what i did and the solution i found online
[04:39:36] <mindis|wurk> Famic but if you're already dependant on jquery i guess you could just create real elements with similar properties on page load or so
[04:39:49] <thomedy> my inclination is to give just the relevant code (1 function) or should i give the whole fidle
[04:39:57] <mink> dogmatic69, thanks a lot :)
[04:40:14] <Famic> mindis|wurk: nah, not worth it. But that would be nice for jquery to handle those. If css is deactivated, well, then selector wouldn't find anything
[04:40:23] <thomedy> essentially its cancelRequestAnimFrame =  and then a bunch of || 's
[04:40:32] <Famic> I suppose it's too much dom based though
[04:40:42] <thomedy> which i thought i had i noticed paul irish put it in a ((){})()
[04:40:45] <thomedy> that function
[04:40:56] <thomedy> and he has more of the  ||'s
[04:41:49] <thomedy> well its fixed and i didn't ask for help to do so... i just want to know more so i can learn from it
[04:43:03] <Mech0z> anyone that can see why I get Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'datepicker'  with http://pastebin.com/zpsxDLyb
[04:47:22] <faraway> Mech0z: probably you didn't include date picker to your custom jquer.ui
[04:47:55] <Mech0z> faraway isnt that default? I just downloaded the newest jquery.ui
[04:48:37] <faraway> Mech0z: i just read the .custom. so that's why i asked
[04:51:25] <cusco_> hi..
[04:51:37] <faraway> Mech0z: are you sure that the jquery ui is really loaded
[04:51:37] <cusco_> using a dialog, can I trigger a event on close??
[04:51:56] <mink> dogmatic69, it's not work :D
[04:52:13] <mink> click on checkbox please http://jsfiddle.net/z8jSf/2/
[04:52:25] <faraway> cusco_: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ > events  > close
[04:52:41] <Mech0z> faraway how do I test that?
[04:52:56] <cusco_> ow
[04:52:58] <cusco_> k thanks
[04:53:28] <Mech0z> faraway nwm
[04:53:33] <Mech0z> I can see in chrome its not
[04:56:01] <mindis|wurk> mink you need to stop the propagation of events. when you click the checkbox it does the default browser behavior and then the click passes to the div which then does whatever you assigned to it
[04:56:31] <mindis|wurk> so at its simplest something like $('input:checkbox').click( function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); });
[04:57:06] <sente> fairuz: do you know python?

[05:34:18] <SP33D> so i can scroll that can i make that any how with jquery
[05:34:29] <faraway> Famic: do you really have applied the transition to the html element ?
[05:34:38] <SP33D> can i scroll a page to a position with jquery or is there a more better solution?
[05:34:46] <Famic> faraway: firebug shows it, yes
[05:35:13] <SP33D> my lame analog idea would be to make a iframe box with a page behind and then scroll it on arrow click to left or right
[05:35:38] <SP33D> but maybe there is a better way i need a any content slider :D
[05:36:29] <SP33D> should i make a jpeg or did any one got what i mean?
[05:36:45] <some_dude> SP33D:  what you need to scroll ?
[05:36:46] <faraway> Famic: hmm, i only tested it in webkit right now and there i get the correct info
[05:37:02] <SP33D> some html content
[05:37:14] <SP33D> i wanna display a long html content in a box
[05:37:18] <SP33D> and make it scroll able
[05:37:44] <SP33D> not with the normal html scroll bar i whant to use some arrow gifs
[05:37:50] <some_dude> SP33D: http://slodive.com/web-development/jquery-scroll/ hf
[05:39:09] <SP33D> some_dude sorry that is vertical scroll
[05:39:13] <SP33D> i need horizontal scrolls
[05:40:06] <shoky_> kraftwer1: var objects = $('div');    objects[3] doesn't do another DOM query

[05:40:42] <shoky_> oks. sups

[05:41:23] <Lucky--> Hey I've been scratching my head at this problem for hte last 6 hours, I am trying to convert from using global vars and shit to using the revealing module pattern.

Site: http://mobilepayday.azurewebsites.net Maybe one of you guys with a fresh
[05:41:24] <Lucky--> pair of eyes could spot the error, because i've been staring at this shit for 6 hours, and i'm ready to just go back to procedural based jquery when I'd really like to nail OOP js and use it properly. Working dropdowns are bank_account_type,months_at_bank,drivers_license_st,months_employed :-/

[05:45:34] <SP33D> some dude good examples
[05:45:40] <SP33D> i need a sultion without a bar
[05:45:44] <SP33D> only with arrows
[05:45:47] <SP33D> left right
[05:47:00] <SP33D> like any normal img slider but i wanna slide complet styled div boxes
[05:54:10] <chilversc_> well thats very odd behaviour in chrome's console debugger
[05:54:36] <chilversc_> if I have; function foo() { debugger; } foo(1, 2, 3); and check the arguments in there, it shows nothing
[05:54:59] <chilversc_> however; function foo() { var a = arguments; debugger; } does work, and then arguments is correct
[05:58:34] <some_dude> SP33D: slap two buttons on the sides it and move stuff inside with animate() and key events
[06:00:06] <chilversc_> is there a function in jquery to parse the content-type header? or should I just do a regex match for ^text/html\s
[06:03:21] <SP33D> found a solution thx
[06:03:21] <SP33D> http://caroufredsel.frebsite.nl/c
[06:03:53] <shoky_> chilversc_: if you're not accessing the arguments there's no reason for it to be there :P chrome's just optimizing it seems

[06:27:18] <NodeX> or somehting along those lines

[06:27:35] <Grundell> okay so i need to exchange an id of a div (div id="see-trns") to togg-trns how do i do this ?
[06:28:25] <Grundell> (then i need to change) the thext inside a (a href> See me <) to Try me

[06:28:45] <rogan_> but dno why it wudnt work...
[06:28:49] <xmaddness> Wouldn't it be better to change the class, rather than the id?
[06:29:07] <NodeX> Grundel ... look at replaceWith();
[06:29:08] <xmaddness> I always thought of ID's being stateless
[06:29:11] <Grundell> well I have to keep this as an ID thats why ?
[06:29:12] <NodeX> ?replaceWith
[06:29:13] <xmaddness> erm static
[06:29:13] <bot-t> .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/

[06:33:01] <Grundell> Quick qustion $(this).replaceWith,what does this do ?
[06:33:15] <xmaddness> jammsen: does that selection fire an event?
[06:33:24] <Grundell> Sorry got it
[06:33:28] <jammsen> Grundell: http://api.jquery.com/?ns0=1&s=.replacewith&go=
[06:33:31] <xmaddness> or do you store a global var that something is selected?
[06:33:35] <NodeX> Grundell : replaces $(this); with whatever
[06:33:44] <Grundell> realized
[06:33:56] <NodeX> rogan_ : sorry, my brian doens't want to work!
[06:34:02] <NodeX> brain *
[06:34:02] <jammsen> xmaddness: i dont have a selector yet, is there a jquery resolution?
[06:34:25] <rogan_> aha its alright
[06:34:26] <xmaddness> jasmmsen: this all depends on how your image crop selection tool works
[06:34:55] <rogan_> nodex all it shud do is take a uk postcode, ie e2 8ex or e28ex and return the area code of it i.e e2
[06:35:05] <jammsen> xmaddness: no i mean i have no tool for that yet, is there a plugin or something buildin in jquery?
[06:35:06] <rogan_> and it works fine in php with preg_replace
[06:36:09] <xmaddness> jammsen: oh I dunno of any off hand
[06:37:17] <some_dude> jammsen: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=image+crop+jquery
[06:38:02] <xmaddness> rogan_: it looks like anything that matches that regex is being replaced with a null string
[06:38:10] <xmaddness> so output is blank
[06:38:30] <jammsen> some_dude: i already have done that, if you have read what i write, i was asking something different!!
[06:38:33] <xmaddness> so when you are checking the acceptedPostalcodes in the array, it doesn't find it
[06:38:49] <rogan_> ohh
[06:38:56] <xmaddness> rogan_: http://jsfiddle.net/9JQUj/2/
[06:38:57] <rogan_> i thort it worked like preg_replace
[06:39:15] <some_dude> 'xmaddness: no i mean i have no tool for that yet, is there a plugin or something buildin in jquery?'
[06:39:23] <xmaddness> trying e28ex
[06:39:43] <rogan_> yeah your right
[06:39:55] <mister_m> hi I am having an issue trying to insert a row in a table that sums a particular column. You specify a table and a column class when invoked. When there is more than one table on a page it appears that jquery is looking at both tables at the same time and inserting TWO rows instead of one. I have a  paste of my snippet here.http://jsfiddle.net/VF7CK/ I select all tables, and loop through them - passing $(this) to other functions to
[06:39:56] <xmaddness> so the problem lies in that replace
[06:40:16] <xmaddness> the regex is working though, it is matching and replacing
[06:40:37] <rogan_> hmm
[06:40:42] <rogan_> in php i have thius..
[06:40:56] <xmaddness> plus when you jsfiddle, be sure to select jquery as the lib
[06:41:01] <xmaddness> it was defaulted to mootools
[06:41:04] <rogan_> http://pastebin.com/Etv95kpQ
[06:41:12] <rogan_> ahh that wud explain alot too xD
[06:41:15] <xmaddness> :P
[06:41:19] <rogan_> im effectively trying to do that
[06:41:20] <rogan_> in JS
[06:43:00] <Pixotic> Hi, I'm having trouble trying to properly explain my jquery problem adequately :v
[06:44:05] <mister_m> As for my snip[pet above - nevermind. I wasn't doing what I said I was doing
[06:44:27] <mister_m> (not actually passing $(this), and instead passing the selector
[06:44:51] <Pixotic> Basically I have a php script which lists a bunch of items in a database, and a link at the bottom to open a jquery dialog. the dialog calls a php include via ajax which allows the user to add a new item to a list
[06:45:51] <Pixotic> that works fine, my problem is I've now added an icon which should open the same dialog div but populate it with a different php include
[06:46:14] <xmaddness> rogan_: I would probably do this in two steps
[06:46:17] <Pixotic> however, the title for the dialog does not update properly, nor does the php include for the new dialog appear
[06:46:28] <Pixotic> here's the code for the two js functions: http://pastebin.com/ABXuwBhx
[06:46:30] <xmaddness> rogan_: step 1) See if the pattern matches
[06:46:44] <rogan_> using .match is does yes
[06:46:48] <xmaddness> rogan_: step 2) If it matches, then do a replace based on the regex
[06:47:04] <rogan_> in Js what do i replace it with though
[06:47:05] <xmaddness> rather than trying to do the detection, and replacement, in one step
[06:47:09] <rogan_> because the replace is dynamic
[06:47:09] <Pixotic> I'm still pretty new to jquery so I'm having a hard time identifying what the problem is here
[06:47:27] <xmaddness> rogan: not sure to be honest
[06:47:39] <xmaddness> I havn't done much regex replacements
[06:47:46] <xmaddness> at least not in js
[06:47:50] <xmaddness> just mostly matching
[06:48:42] <Pixotic> Also, both functions include a dialog close event and a change title event, but neither seem to happen
[06:48:45] <rogan_> yeah this is where im lost
[06:48:47] <rogan_> easy stuff in php
[06:48:50] <Pixotic> I guess my first question is why that might be
[06:49:18] <jeffsmykil> anyone tell me what im doing wrong?  My ajax call aways fails iand in the network tab it just says "pending"   http://pastebin.com/A6Bm2VCA
[06:50:13] <jeffsmykil> the json file is in the same directory as the html
[06:52:56] <Pixotic> Also, when working with jquery dialogs, do I need to have one dialog div for each type of dialog box I want, or is one enough?
[06:52:57] <Whirl3d> Your script tag belongs in the <head> element, I think, jeffsmykil
[06:53:14] <Pixotic> e.g. one div for addnewitem and one for createotherthing etc
[06:53:29] <jeffsmykil> pixotic depends on how you populate them
[06:53:35] <jeffsmykil> we do seperate divs for each dialog
[06:53:51] <jeffsmykil> but our dialogs serve very diff purposes
[06:53:58] <Pixotic> in all cases they're populated by ajax calls to other php scripts
[06:54:07] <jeffsmykil> Whirl3d: I hope thats it
[06:54:09] <Pixotic> http://pastebin.com/ABXuwBhx
[06:54:34] <Pixotic> those two functions are what's used to call and populate the dialog divs
[06:55:05] <jeffsmykil> Whirl3d: still doesn't work
[06:55:07] <jeffsmykil> :/
[06:55:16] <cusco_> hi, I have: <li class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-circle-triangle-e"></span><span>asdasd</span></li>
[06:55:28] <Pixotic> would it help if I linked you the page this stuff exists on?
[06:55:29] <cusco_> I would like the icon to be on the same line as asdasd
[06:55:33] <Whirl3d> Pixotic, put your html, css, and js in a fiddle (don't worry that the ajax part won't work) and paste it back here. It's a lot easier to see the problem with a working example, even if it's only partly working
[06:55:39] <jeffsmykil> Pixotic: either way should work
[06:55:39] <cusco_> don't know how
[06:55:49] <Pixotic> Whirl3d alright, bear with me a sec
[06:56:06] <rogan_> xmaddness: got it, javascript actually has a $1 replacement option
[06:56:09] <rogan_> didnt think it would
[06:56:22] <rogan_> but .replace(/regex/, "$1") works
[06:56:23] <Pixotic> I've never used fiddle before... this could be fun.
[06:56:45] <rogan_> but jQuery.inarray is matching soemthing it shouldnety
[06:57:15] <Whirl3d> rogan_, you could also do string.replace(/regex/, function (a, b, c, d) ) where a, b,c,d represent capture groups
[06:57:41] <rogan_> oo ill look into that Whirl3d
[06:57:46] <warrenparsons> Pixotic: Just make sure to select jQuery from the library dropdown in the left-hand menu. I don't think it's the default.
[06:58:10] <Whirl3d> I may have the syntax backwards, but it's something like that. LOL I'll look up the link I foun dit on. brb
[06:58:38] <Whirl3d> http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[06:59:00] <Pixotic> Whirl3d ehhhhh of course none of the images work since they're relatively linked.
[06:59:09] <Pixotic> Would it be acceptable to just link you the page?
[06:59:12] <FernandoBasso> I have a table. One td has a teacher's name. Another td has the a link with the id of the teacher. Would it be possible to get the name of that tr when I click on the link?
[06:59:43] <Pixotic> http://e1m1.sidemoon.net/RC/ui.php
[06:59:48] <Pixotic> well there it is, anyway.
[06:59:51] <Whirl3d> You can set a line like this in html:  <base href='http://www.yourdomain.com'/> and it will grab the images
[06:59:57] <Pixotic> oh, neat
[07:02:27] <Pixotic> http://jsfiddle.net/AVMHa/
[07:02:32] <Pixotic> well there's the page in question
[07:02:46] <Pixotic> it doesn't populate either dialog though :/
[07:03:09] <Whirl3d> COuple of things:
[07:03:19] <Pixotic> on the page itself, clicking the 'click here to add a new choice' link will populate properly (though the dialog title doesn't set properly)
[07:03:21] <Whirl3d> only paste the body contents in the html
[07:04:26] <Whirl3d> use jsfiddle as a limited case sandbox. Don't place your entire page contents in it unless the problem you are having relates to the entire page contents (say formatting or something). It's best to isolate the problem and troubleshoot from there
[07:04:43] <Pixotic> Ah.
[07:05:33] <Whirl3d> Because you are running your scripts inline rather than running them all together in the head of your doc, you haven't created the "Dialog" div for it to do anything with
[07:06:04] <Whirl3d> It's best to put all your jquery goodness in the head of your document and wrap the function $(document).ready(function () { my jquery stuff});
[07:08:12] <Whirl3d> This ensures that elements you want to use are already in the dom
[07:10:07] <Pixotic> Alrighty, the dialog div was squrited into the page by another php include. Can't remember why I thought that was a good idea, but that's fixed now. I understand the logic of moving all my jquery goodness to the top of the file, but I don't quite follow you with wrapping the function doc.ready
[07:10:33] <Whirl3d> And, just for pointers sake: every time you use jquery to search the dom, it has to run through the elements in your document* (this is an exaggeration when ID's are used, but nonetheless, it takes time to do this). So it's best if you see that you are going to be using $("#dialog")... alot, cache that "selection" in a variable and use the varialbe to reference it
[07:11:23] <Whirl3d> because the dom loads from top to bottom, if you put your scripts at the top and they start looking for your elements, they haven't loaded yet
[07:11:50] <Whirl3d> So you solve this by running your jquery stuff once the document is ready...hence $(document).ready(function () {});
[07:12:25] <Whirl3d> so, $(document).ready(function () {     put your existing codes here });
[07:13:22] <Whirl3d> of course inside a <script></script> element in the <head></head> of your document or you can store them in an external file and link them to the head of your document (still need doc ready though)
[07:13:33] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: Unless you're talking about some kind of special case for which I'm missing the context, it's generally better for performance to load JS files at the end of the document, just before the closing body tag.
[07:14:40] <Whirl3d> I have heard that as well. I think there's some conflicting reports about the best place to put it, but I have just always put it at the top of the page.
[07:15:46] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: It's mostly to avoid page content being delayed while the browser downloads JS files, because many/most browsers block rendering while waiting to download/execute JS.
[07:16:12] <Pixotic> Sorry, afk a mo - my better half needs some help with something
[07:17:38] <Whirl3d> Still, I don't know that it matters if you don't want the page rendered without your jquery pieces, putting it at the top or the bottom doesn't matter in that case.
[07:18:06] <Whirl3d> I don't mean to defend a position one way or the other. I just do what I've always done
[07:18:07] <Whirl3d> lol
[07:18:39] <Pixotic> Okay I'm back.
[07:19:04] <Whirl3d> Plus my pages never have any content anyways. I usually have a blank dom to start with for the most part and build my elements programmatically. --probably not the best way to handle it either.
[07:19:14] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: No worries. There are always exceptions to a rule. For apps where your display is heavily dependent on JS, it might make sense. For websites where display is primarily dependent on structure and CSS, with JS adding behavior only, placing them at the end makes more sense.
[07:19:15] <Pixotic> And I get the doc.ready concept now, thanks for explaining it for me :)
[07:20:09] <Whirl3d> warrenparsons, good information. I will see if I can find some examples that would benefit from that knowledge in my existing projects. Thanks.

[07:20:54] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: Look up High Performance Web Sites and Even Faster Web Sites, both by Steve Souders. Lots of good info on this and many related topics.
[07:21:15] <Whirl3d> doing it right now.
[07:21:55] <warrenparsons> He also has a blog with great content about web performance.
[07:23:21] <Whirl3d> Anybody here every use CreativeEdge.com  ? I am downloading Even Faster Websites now
[07:24:18] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: Never heard of it. Looks interesting.
[07:24:27] <Whirl3d> and reading his blog and viewing everything he's ever published all in one spot
[07:24:41] <Whirl3d> It's really shocking how many great resources they have.
[07:24:43] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: I'd recommend reading High Performance Web Sites first if possible. EFWS builds on a lot of what's laid down there.
[07:25:00] <rethus> if i have 2 or more select-boxes in an div... how can i only access on the first or only on the second...
[07:25:12] <rethus> in this way? $('#editFilterGuiRows select[0]')
[07:25:18] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: The first book will also represent your 80% performance gains, with the second addressing the 20%.

[07:34:55] <dogarrhea2> if i want to control another person's browser from my computer using just javascript
[07:34:57] <dogarrhea2> how is this done?
[07:35:07] <dogarrhea2> just general strategy
[07:35:51] <pachet> step 1: learn javascript
[07:35:54] <pachet> step 2: learn c++
[07:36:06] <dogarrhea2> pachet i've seen this done
[07:36:07] <pachet> step 3: pick apart every major browser looking for potential vulnerabilities
[07:36:09] <dogarrhea2> without c++
[07:36:17] <pachet> step 4: realize its not worth it and move on with your life
[07:36:22] <dogarrhea2> pachet.
[07:36:35] <dogarrhea2> are you a troll? chat vendors have been doing this for ages
[07:36:47] <dogarrhea2> like when you go to sprint.com and talk to a representative
[07:37:03] <dogarrhea2> you may click a button to allow them to control your browser remotely
[07:37:13] <dogarrhea2> without c++ or plugins or dlls or any of that
[07:37:37] <dogarrhea2> mabye you're just ignorant and are talking for nothign
[07:37:46] <BakaOu> pachet is right you should do what he said
[07:39:43] <dogarrhea2> love freenode. so many useless trolls
[07:39:48] <dogarrhea2> it's like yahoo answers in real time.
[07:39:48] <pachet> what you're describing isnt control of the browser - its control of the page
[07:40:37] <pachet> and limited control of the page at that - basically you just poll the server for queued commands
[07:41:31] <dogarrhea2> thought it might come to that
[07:41:38] <dogarrhea2> so there's potential for things to be slow
[07:41:54] <dogarrhea2> with this so called "observer" pattern which is really just spamming another domain for instructions
[07:42:20] <danzik17> use websockets.  no spam needed.
[07:42:41] <pachet> yeah, websockets cuts down on the chatter
[07:44:32] <amirite> what design pattern do you guys using for building multi-component, multi-application applications
[07:44:43] <pachet> multi-application applications? :[
[07:45:05] <danzik17> amirite: you probably want to read http://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/
[07:45:15] <amirite> yeah, stuff that does multiple stuff
[07:45:25] <amirite> i don't like blogs
[07:45:28] <amirite> blogs are naughty
[07:45:36] <danzik17> that sucks.

[07:46:27] <amirite> thanks danzik
[07:46:31] * amirite kissy smoochy u
[07:53:15] <thansen> so I seem to have hit an issue where IE doesn't allow crossite ajax calls to happen but ff/chrome do...is there an elegant solution to this?
[07:54:09] <thansen> jQuery.ajax('http://www.example.com'); for example works great in ff/chrome but does nothing in IE for me :(
[07:59:34] <rethus> how can i access on an element on same level...
[07:59:59] <rethus> <select> <select> <input> im inside of the first <select>
[08:00:25] <rethus> have it i to use parent().children('input') for that, or is there another way
[08:01:23] <ezio> anyone know where i can find a copy of the spinner code for ui
[08:01:27] <ezio> http://docs.jquery.com/action/edit/UI/API/1.9/Spinner
[08:01:54] <Pixotic> I feel like I'm missing something very basic here, but here goes; I have these functions at the top of my page: http://pastebin.com/ABXuwBhx and a bunch of calls to said functions generated by php, (the onclick element sets the sgID and gName vars, then call callNewChoice(sgID, gName), for example
[08:02:10] <Pixotic> it seems to pass the data on appropriately and the dialog that opens up has the correct data in it
[08:02:22] <Pixotic> slight problem though, is that the title of the dialog never updates after the first call
[08:02:49] <Pixotic> I'm confused by that, since callNewChoice has .dialog('close'); and .attr set to change it
[08:02:56] <Pixotic> $("#dialog").attr('Title', 'New ' + gName + ' texture');
[08:03:19] <Pixotic> and it sets the title properly in the first instance, just never updates it when I click a different link
[08:03:38] <Pixotic> I checked the page source of the rendered page and the variables are showing as set correctly
[08:04:08] <ajpiano> Pixotic: to change the title of a jquery ui dialog you are supposed to do $("#dialog").dialog("option", "title", "newTitle");
[08:04:18] <Pixotic> Ah.
[08:06:02] <Pixotic> That worked, thank you!
[08:07:21] <cusco_> hi, I have: <li class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-circle-triangle-e"></span><span>asdasd</span></li>
[08:07:24] <cusco_> I would like the icon to be on the same line as asdasd
[08:07:26] <cusco_> don't know how
[08:08:46] <Pixotic> when using $.ajax, the example I found has a success: function(msg){} attribute for the call, is there a similar attribute for failure or just straight-up dumping the response into a message box or something? You know, for debugging and stuff.
[08:09:38] <ajpiano> Pixotic: there is an error callback, you can dump the data anywhere you want
[08:09:45] <ajpiano> the console is a good place for it
[08:10:12] <Pixotic> Sorry, I'm ridiculously new and inept to js and jquery - how could I use that? something like error: msgbox(msg);?
[08:10:16] <rethus> how can i easyly add one aatr('class') to a list of existeing class-values?
[08:11:52] <ajpiano> Pixotic: if you want a callback that fires regardless of success/error you can use the complete: callback
[08:12:27] <ajpiano> Pixotic: $.ajax({complete: function(jqXHR) { console.log (jqXHR); }});

[08:14:18] <scalex000> hello guys, I want to know, Im using jquery and  I want to fill 1 combobox, also
[08:21:51] * Lucky-- feels stupid. I just now realized that when you include jquery and if you store a selector to a var, you can access full jQuery functions like myvar.val() or myvar.each() without doing $(myvar).val()
[08:22:17] <shoky> you are so much smarter now. good job
[08:23:01] <Lucky--> yes. my shit runs so much faster now.
[08:23:06] <Lucky--> rejoice.
[08:23:16] <shoky> that is not jquery-specific, btw
[08:24:33] <shoky> well, your example is, so nvermind me
[08:24:52] <Lucky--> shoky: i figured as much. I thought you HAD to use the $. selector whenever you wanted to use jQuery functionality to access the extended functionality
[08:25:11] <Lucky--> between doing that and converting to revealing module pattern instead of stupid global vars, I've nearly tripled the speed of my app
[08:25:25] <shoky> sweet
[08:25:58] <Lucky--> took me 6 hours though of scratching my head debugging :-( first attempt at oop js
[08:26:39] <HassanS> feels good though eh?
[08:26:54] <shoky> i donno why, but i really hate the name 'revealing module pattern'
[08:26:55] <Lucky--> aye, well that and besides its now 8:26 am and i haz not slept :-(
[08:26:55] <troll-boy> Lucky--, sure its not... you ever use document.getElementById()?
[08:27:12] <Lucky--> troll-boy: yes back in the day building customizations for ms dynamics crm
[08:27:17] <troll-boy> odds are you've secretly been using it the whole time ;-)
[08:27:20] <Lucky--> but then again that was more of copy and paste coding
[08:30:19] <rethus> i have this to act on no named selectbox: Means the second Box in row...   $('#'+filterRow+' select').eq(1)
[08:30:32] <mathi> hi
[08:30:47] <rethus> for this box i need  to remove options....         how can i add this: option[value='option1']").remove()
[08:31:13] <rethus> $('#'+filterRow+' select').eq(1).("option[value='option1']").remove() ?
[08:31:54] <rethus> didn't work..
[08:32:36] <rethus> is there another way to do all this stuff in the first brackets... like    select [1] ... ?
[08:34:40] <pachet> $('#'+filterRow+' select').eq(1).children("[value='option1']").remove()
[08:35:07] <rethus> ah, great. thanks
[08:41:43] <rethus> pachet: can i also run each option inside of a select with each() ?
[08:42:20] <pachet> sure
[08:42:43] <rethus> $('#filterRow_0 select option').eq(1).each(function(i,e){ seems only to give me the selected
[08:43:14] <rethus> ah, whait, i see... cause auf eq(1) ! right ?
[08:44:26] <rethus> this works $('#filterRow_0 select').eq(1).children('option').each(function(i,e){
[08:45:33] <pachet> $('select').children('option') is redundant
[08:47:30] <rethus> pachet() but u choose the second select with eq(1), and after this, i do option

[08:55:25] <mindtheory> anyone know why this would happen: http://bit.ly/MWLtku
[08:55:32] <HassanS> I see I should have been using the margin-left and not just shifting the left property
[08:55:36] <mindtheory> the buckets go dark then to blue right after rollover
[08:55:55] <mindtheory> on rollover i mean... the first time only, but subsequent rollovers tween nicely from white to blue
[09:13:20] <troll-boy> if I'm adding content to a accordian panel is there a way to make ti auto-expand to accommodate it?
[09:17:49] <troll-boy> another dumb question.. I know I can do $('myform').serialize() to convert all form data to a serialized string for storing... but is there a way to reverse that, like $('myform').loadSerialized(json_data); to restock my form?
[09:19:16] <troll-boy> yes, apparantly there is

[09:26:07] <voot545> what's a good way to detect where the heading is in a news article
[09:26:32] <voot545> it's not always the h1 element
[09:26:55] <jedimind> uhmmm is it in <article>
[09:27:00] <jedimind> can it be assumed its the first heading of <atricle> ?
[09:27:14] <voot545> nothing can be assumed
[09:27:17] <jedimind> then
[09:27:18] <jedimind> you're SOL
[09:36:17] <argoooooo> Is it possible to build a database-driven webpage by using html5 and javascript?
[09:37:30] <Haprog> depends what you are going to use for a database and for what purpose. usually you'd need some backend to handle DB stuff.
[09:38:03] <Haprog> You could use a DB with JS by using a Node.js backend for example though.
[09:38:51] <argoooooo> Ok. Thank you
[09:42:34] <argoooooo> Without knowing i saw a risk that you expose your datbase cridentials if you are using a non server-side solution. right?
[09:42:48] <ojii> is there any way to get old jQuery documentation?
[09:43:03] <Haprog> argoooooo: yes
[09:43:10] <ojii> or to bypass that: what was the way to send custom headers in 1.4.2 in ajax requests? (headers was added in 1.5..)
[09:44:50] <Haprog> argoooooo: that's why you shouldn't handle "raw" database connection on the clientside. only through some backend that validates commands and possibly uses authentication if needed.
[09:45:21] <Haprog> unless you use localStorage as a database but that's usually for a different purpose.
[09:49:05] <voot545> if I don't want the combined text for an element, I should not use .text(), but I should ...
[09:51:48] <shoky> ojii: i think you had to specify a beforeSend handler, in which you could set the xhr request headers
[09:52:38] <ojii> shthx
[09:52:40] <ojii> shoky, thx
[10:08:15] <garrilla> I'm not sure how to articulate my problem, but I think I want to remove a function... I'm using this plugin http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/featuredzoomer.htm - after an event I want to stop the image being zoomable... can you help?
[10:13:20] <garrilla> anyone alive or is this a zombie channel?
[10:13:27] <daggerhart> Hi all.   Does anyone know how to execute jquery on a page with a #fragment in the url, only after the page has already jumped to the fragment ?
[10:13:35] <g0z> people are here
[10:13:45] <garrilla> thx g0z
[10:14:16] <daggerhart> I'm having a firefox fragment vs jquery.expander problem.
[10:28:38] <guidobouman> I have an issume: pjax is firing two requests, one ajax call, and refreshes page afterwards. Even though I have the timeout set quite high.
[10:28:54] <guidobouman> Live code: http://test.foolproofdevelopment.com/community
[10:29:29] <guidobouman> It's the red menu by the way.
[10:30:39] <garrilla> I have $('#image1').addimagezoom({//some properties}) - all works great but now I want to stop #image1 doing addimagezoom... how?
[10:30:43] <BFranks> I've noticed that in both opera and chrome (haven't tried ye old crusty FF or IE) that even the demo pages like (http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#toolbar) have issues responding to clicks .. Especially if you toggle between the demos?
[10:33:32] <BFranks> Hmmm could just be a slow load.. Cause if I wait, hover the cursor over, wait for the highlight animation, then click, it works 100%.. but if I'm toggling between demos and clicking it's prone to fail.
[10:35:38] <gwinh_dev> hi All! I have one animation problem that needs to be fixed here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/PRMyX/2/embedded/result/   so basically, on mouseenter on the first slide, it animates the height and width and the other slides on the right decreases its width and increases it's left property.. but on mouseleave of the first slide (even if I have unbind the other slides mouseenter event) and instantly
[10:35:39] <gwinh_dev> hovering to other slides, it the other slides stops animating and results to mispositioning
[10:36:11] <guidobouman>  
[10:36:20] <guidobouman> BFranks, no issues here at all
[10:38:02] <rand0mbits> if i have a dom element that has N siblings, how can i find its index within the list of those siblings?

[10:39:02] <gwinh_dev> any advice/tips will do..just need answers to the issue I'm having
[10:39:24] <rand0mbits> ajpiano: thanks!
[10:40:16] <diverdude> what does the module.exports do ?

[10:52:54] <djang0nub> hey guys, i need some help: this code correctly returns the ID of the parent form element on the page, but if the page has an input element with id="id", it fails: $('#wrap .three-column input').map(function(){ return $($(this).closest('form')[0]).prop("id"); });
[10:53:02] <djang0nub> HTML Code and JS here: http://jsfiddle.net/ApCRc/
[10:54:10] <shoky> ceej: it's because you included the raw css from github, which doesnt have the images or smth

[10:55:53] <karlheinz2> how can I iterate over all elements contained inside a div?
[10:56:26] <ceej> shoky: ah!  Thank you so much :)
[10:56:32] <djang0nub> karlheinz2: $('div#id')/$('div.class').each() or .map()
[10:56:39] <guidobouman> karlheinz2: $('.mydiv').children().each(function(){ // your code here });
[10:56:50] <pachet> maybe he meant recursively
[10:57:12] <karlheinz2> well recursively would actually be better. I want to disable all elements inside a div
[10:57:35] <karlheinz2> so they may be more than an element deep

[11:10:36] <mayhem93> but in the core.js file you can clearly see kendo = window.kendo = window.kendo || {}, so what's up with the undefines ?
[11:13:06] <mayhem93> damn it... i'm so helpless, gonna get some booze then, cya guys

[11:16:42] <shwaiil> hi
[11:17:14] <scalex000> shwaiil, hi, I need some help
[11:17:26] <shoky> guidobouman: the docs say:  $(link).pjax( container, options )
[11:17:58] <shwaiil> Q: Is there a way to unbind() events on a given element ? Like remove ALL, even those I don't know about ?! thanks
[11:17:59] <guidobouman> I had that before. But it's supposed to be the same, let me restore that for you.
[11:18:13] <scalex000> shoky, pls save me
[11:18:27] <shoky> ;S
[11:18:36] <scalex000> hahaha
[11:18:51] <scalex000> I dont have any idea how to do it
[11:19:03] <scalex000> but I have the first part
[11:19:08] <scalex000> pls guide me
[11:19:15] <scalex000> with your wisdom lol
[11:19:43] <dabear> shoky: did you try unbind() ?
[11:19:45] <Whirl3d> Did you say "shave me" ?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n49U1BxZ2M
[11:19:51] <dabear> without parameters it removes all events
[11:20:02] <shwaiil> dabear: I'll try it :) thanks for looking.
[11:20:16] <shwaiil> but i'm a little bit worried because I think it wont work.
[11:20:27] <shwaiil> I should delete the previous instance
[11:20:30] <shwaiil> somehow
[11:21:04] <shoky> guidobouman: sorry you're right, it's the same (and the docs also mention it)
[11:21:38] <scalex000> shoky, http://pastebin.com/WHWxHtWm
[11:22:00] <scalex000> shoky, check pls I will tell what I want
[11:22:14] <guidobouman> shoky: No problem, the thing is: it sends the request, I can see that in my console, the return is valid: http 200, whole shabam. But pjax decides to refresh anyhow.
[11:22:30] <shwaiil> dabear: yes, didn't worked. Well, if a pluging doesn't have a API, is there a way to delete the current instance before initializing it again ?
[11:22:40] <shwaiil> that would solve my issue I supose
[11:23:02] <guidobouman> scalex000: I'll look at it while shoky is looking at my issue. :P
[11:23:13] <scalex000> :P
[11:23:15] <dabear> shwaiil: it *does* work
[11:23:28] <scalex000> when you looked pls told me
[11:23:46] <dabear> however, you might not have explained your problem correctly, so that you think it does something which it doesn't
[11:24:00] <dabear> .unbind removes all attached events handlers
[11:24:28] <guidobouman> scalex000: I looked, but what is your issue?
[11:24:53] <shwaiil> dabear, yeah. Ok, so I'm using this plugin slidesJs. I need to reinitialize it, so that a diferent number of images etc can be used correctly. There's no API to reinitialize, so I just run the plugin intialization again.
[11:25:22] <shwaiil> The problem is, there's a "pagination". I basically remove the element and when the plugin is init, it generates. The issue is that, the previous timer / or intervar or whatever
[11:25:34] <shwaiil> is still active, so the pagination is not working properly.
[11:25:57] <shwaiil> I wonder if there's a way to delete the previous plugin instance before initializing it again
[11:26:03] <shwaiil> that would be the solution I supose
[11:26:05] <scalex000> guidobouman, ok on the element_6_6
[11:26:37] <scalex000> guidobouman, its working good but I want to use the select value to fill a var
[11:28:05] <guidobouman> scalex000: Wouldn't you just use var my_var = ui.item.code;?
[11:28:45] <scalex000> ok
[11:28:53] <guidobouman> if you need it to be global you could do: window['my_var'] = ui.item.code;
[11:29:56] <garrilla> how do I stop $('#image2') being associated with addimagezoom() ??? http://jsfiddle.net/s6TMs/6/
[11:30:34] <shoky> guidobouman the prob has to do with line 209 in jquery.pjax.js
[11:30:59] <shoky> after the ajax request has succeeded, it does:  if (!container.contents) {  window.location = container.url; return; }
[11:31:11] <scalex000> guidobouman, i get error
[11:31:12] <shoky> not sure what that contents is
[11:31:32] <scalex000> guidobouman, this language is javascript or what?
[11:31:42] <guidobouman> shoky: That' 204 for me:
[11:31:49] <guidobouman> if (!container.contents) {
[11:31:51] <_pr0t0type_> Hey guys.  Does anyone know how to have a callback function that only gets called after another funciton in query?  Perhaps something like, $.wait(execute_this_first, the_exceute_this_function);

[11:32:20] <shoky> from your server
[11:32:22] <_pr0t0type_> Is there anything like this in jQuery?
[11:32:48] <test> :)
[11:33:03] <test> node

[11:39:57] <Justus> hi, got a problem here with jqueryui I'm calling button() without parameters and it changes the buttons allright, but they are way to big, they're like 2 times the size of the standard button, what is the problem there? I'm using overcast theme
[11:40:31] <Justus> if I change the ui-widget font-size to 0.7em instead of 1.1em it works, but why is it oversized as standard?
[11:45:39] <jyg> When looking at the Events on an element in the inspector in Chrome, how can I find the jQuery .eventype() that actually sets up the listener?
[11:45:40] <guidobouman> shoky: DUDE! You're my hero. Thanks man. Completely missed it.
[11:46:11] <shoky> ;]
[11:46:12] <jyg> it points me to the jQuery source, but I want to find the spot where the listener is instantiated
[11:46:30] <garrilla> How can I change property of function on the fly - http://jsfiddle.net/s6TMs/8/ - please help
[11:46:36] <guidobouman> shoky: Issue: Code Igniter converts headers to uc_first. And I was checking for the header X-PJAX, which is not uc_first.
[11:47:09] <guidobouman> And as array keys are case sensitive, the other one never matched.
[11:47:20] <guidobouman> FAN FUCKING TASTIC!
[11:47:25] <jyg> garrilla, what does "property of a function" mean?
[11:47:27] <guidobouman> Woops, pardon my french.
[11:47:52] <guidobouman> jyg: It's a variable you pass on while calling the function
[11:48:22] <jyg> so you mean change a parameter on the fly? so just pass a diff parameter
[11:51:14] <michaelBA> Hi, is able someone to help me? I have a input element which has a value as encoded html string, i need to get same value, but method .val() returns me decoded string.
[11:51:59] <michaelBA> value="{&quot;Reference&quot;:&quot;1stPart12ndPart13rdPart1&quot;,&quot;TermDate&quot;:&quot;\/Date(1349820000000)\/&quot;,&quot;ReleaseDate&quot;:&quot;\/Date(1349820000000)\/&quot;}" />
[11:52:02] <garrilla> jyg: I don't know, maybe my terms are not correct...
[11:55:08] <JackBauer24> Hi. It is said that "live" method is deprecated. Does "on" method has exactly the same functionality as "live"? Does it detect dynamic DOM elements?
[11:56:21] <guidobouman> michaelBA: var value = $('#my_input').attr('value');
[11:56:56] <tadeurz> hi
[11:57:39] <michaelBA> guidobouman This returns decoded string, i need to have original value
[11:57:44] <BFranks> Hahaha.. I'm trying to teach myself how to check the state of a button (pressed?) but I'm a boob.. http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/29/  (the Hide Done button)  .. Obviously I'm not checking the right element for the class change.. So now I have to ask what's the 'right' / 'normal' way to test the state of a button?
[11:57:50] <dabear> jyg: check jQuery.cache, e.g. jQuery.cache[1].events.click[0].handler
[11:57:58] <guidobouman> michaelBA: Even attr('value')?
[11:58:05] <michaelBA> yes
[11:58:54] <guidobouman> Because val() & attr('value') return in different ways. Hmmm...
[11:58:59] <michaelBA> i also tried to encode val() back to this format, but i dont sucessed
[11:59:23] <guidobouman> You'd need html_entities for that.
[11:59:50] <guidobouman> How did you check what value you got back?
[12:00:01] <guidobouman> Did you print that on screen, echo it or log it?
[12:00:25] <michaelBA> via source code of the page. when i used firebug, i can see that also encoded string
[12:00:38] <michaelBA> only alert

[12:01:59] <shwaiil> Q: Is there a way to scroll top smoothly, with a few lines of code without using plugins ? I remember doing this before, but just can't remember how, I  do rmember something like $(window).animate({ scrollTopOrSomethingHere : someOffsetOrWhateverHere });
[12:02:02] <shwaiil> any tip ?
[12:02:11] <tadeurz> i have problem with node in DOM tree: http://jsfiddle.net/MryEd/ . someone who can help me ?
[12:02:49] <MistuhKurtz> shwaiil, yes you can animate the scrollTop property
[12:03:10] <MistuhKurtz> $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: myVal });
[12:03:25] <voot545>  is it just me, or does the debugger in chrome display javascript arrays with 1k+ elements in a wierd sort of randomized breakdown that makes it look like a multi-dimensional array when it's not
[12:03:37] <MistuhKurtz> I'm not exactly sure why, but 'html, body' was needed to get it working in iOS
[12:04:24] <shwaiil> MistuhKurtz: yeah worked fine, thanks
[12:04:30] <zerri> guidobouman was that for me?
[12:04:40] <horrror> I'm using Modal window for a New Post window - should I use ajax or  iframe so it won't load it in the primary html page?
[12:04:47] <michaelBA> It is same result!
[12:06:02] <guidobouman> zerri: Nope, was helping michaelBA.
[12:06:27] <scalex000> guidobouman, I dont know how to declare a var
[12:06:37] <scalex000> I was trying to use your code but not work
[12:06:40] <al_2000> var =
[12:06:45] <al_2000> :P
[12:06:55] <al_2000> my var = something
[12:07:54] <guidobouman> scalex000: do var my_var; as the first row of your script.
[12:08:07] <guidobouman> As in; 'var my_var;'
[12:08:29] <guidobouman> When you set something to that variable from your select method:
[12:08:43] <GuySoft> hey all, does anyone here use jqplot? and might they know how to reduce the number of points shown on the xaxis? there are so many the numbers all overlap on each other
[12:08:51] <MistuhKurtz> scalex000, you should do some reading about variables and variable scope :)
[12:08:54] <guidobouman> my_var = ui.whatever.this.was;
[12:09:13] <guidobouman> You'll be able to use that variable my_var everywhere in the script file andit will have the same value.
[12:09:24] <scalex000> javascript or jquery, Im trying to find something
[12:12:04] <shwaiil> Q: If using a plugin like $('#foo').myPLugin({ options }); If this plugin adds to the element #foo some intervals or timeout, is there a way to clear them all or check the existent IDs ?
[12:12:06] <shwaiil> Tks
[12:12:12] <maestrojed> the event .scroll only works if there is content that is wider or longer then the dom. I want to capture the horizontal scroll events,  always. Any suggestions?
[12:14:25] <dabear> jyg: made some code for you to lookup an elements handlers: http://jsfiddle.net/9hWLK/1/
[12:18:27] <BFranks> I'm trying to teach myself how to check the state of a button (pressed?) but I'm a noob.. http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/29/  (the 'Hide Done' button is what I'm trying to check the state of)  .. Obviously I'm not checking the right element for the class change.. So now I have to ask what's the 'right' / 'normal' way to test the state of a button?
[12:18:45] <sanguisdex> any ond have a fave Jump Menu snippet?
[12:18:52] <sanguisdex> oi
[12:18:57] <sanguisdex> restating sorry
[12:19:09] <sanguisdex> anyone have a fave Jump Menu snippet?
[12:19:19] <NoiseEee> BFranks: a button has no 'pressed' state, but when a button is clicked, you could give it a particular class like "pressed" for example.
[12:19:56] <scalex000> guidobouman, im still dont know how to do it
[12:20:30] <guidobouman> scalex000: First, read this: http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/global_variable/
[12:20:41] <jyg> dabear, interesting, thank you ver much
[12:22:04] <Famic> is there a reliable way to get the font-size of html element in pixel when it was first set in % ?
[12:22:24] <Famic> it seems the answer depends on the environment when using .css('font-size')
[12:23:21] <imachuchu> is there any good reason a text field's "focusin" and "focusout" events wouldn't be attached to a clone of the field?
[12:24:54] <Kreczor-work> imachuchu: are you using the same id for both fields?
[12:25:07] <enherit> does the $.ready wait for the script tag to load?
[12:25:13] <imachuchu> no, but both events are attached on a shared class
[12:25:26] <imachuchu> (sorry, that was at Kreczor-work
[12:25:27] <jyg> dabear, hmm when i stick it in my code, cache[cacheid] is underfined
[12:25:38] <jyg> er undefined, heh
[12:25:50] <dabear> elem needs to be a dom element
[12:26:00] <dabear> e.g. $0 from the developer console
[12:26:12] <jyg> hmm a single element i guess
[12:26:20] <jyg> oh silly me
[12:26:24] <jyg> n/m
[12:30:32] <scalex000> guidobouman, the var its not the problem
[12:30:37] <GuySoft> um, might anyone know why this jqplot code is stuck at an infinite loop?: gnet.homelinux.com:8000/server/server3
[12:30:48] <GuySoft> http://gnet.homelinux.com:8000/server/server
[12:30:51] <GuySoft> bah
[12:31:01] <GuySoft> why this jqplot code is stuck at an infinite loop?: http://gnet.homelinux.com:8000/server/server3
[12:33:25] <Sembiance> looks like api.jquery.com is down
[12:34:04] <Sam-T> Down for me too.
[12:34:25] <Sembiance> checked a couple of 'down or just me' sites, they all stated that it was down.
[12:34:48] <Sam-T> I was in another IRC channel and everyone who checked there said it was down as well
[12:35:02] <maslo> hi guys how would I be able to make any links within a div makes something when clicked? ('#divid a').click(function(){}); doesn't work
[12:35:38] <zerri> Hey guys should this work to disable a certain header link that I have ?? $('body.blog .the-post h2 a').click(function() { return false; });
[12:35:43] <MistuhKurtz> maslo, what are you trying to do?
[12:35:56] <BFranks> Google this:   site:api.jquery.com hasClass     (Then hit the cached button..)
[12:36:17] <BFranks> replace hasCalss with your query
[12:36:18] <MistuhKurtz> maslo,  $("#divid a").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault; ... });
[12:36:35] <BFranks> Works very well  ;P
[12:37:04] <MistuhKurtz> the function gets passed the event object, 'e', and you have to call preventDefault(); on e to prevent the link from functioning as it would normally without JS
[12:37:59] <maslo> doesn't seem to work, there's severals links within that div and each of them has custom params ie foo="bar" and I'm trying to grab those params when clicked
[12:38:25] <MistuhKurtz> maslo, set up a http://jsfiddle.net and isolate your problem and I would be happy to help.
[12:40:40] <MistuhKurtz> imachuchu, did you ever figure out your problem?
[12:41:00] <MistuhKurtz> The event was binded before your field's clone was created, so it doesn't have the event binded to it
[12:41:58] <MistuhKurtz> you can either clone it and then bind it, or even better use event propagation/bubbling with $.on()
[12:42:07] <MistuhKurtz> ?. on
[12:42:17] <BFranks> NoiseEee: Yay.. http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/31/ works .. thanks! :)
[12:42:18] <MistuhKurtz> .help
[12:42:19] <b-ot> MistuhKurtz, I offer no help, yet. Help me help you: https://github.com/nlogax/ircjsbot/blob/master/core.js#L68

[12:42:34] <MistuhKurtz> .on
[12:42:34] <b-ot> MistuhKurtz, much better than .live. =)
[12:42:35] <Trudko> guys i want to get value of selected option any better way then this? $("#s").find(":selected").val()
[12:42:38] <MistuhKurtz> .?on
[12:42:41] <imachuchu> MistuhKurtz: I didn't solve my problem (but your suggestion might). If I have a field that has a function bound on it's class, I create a new copy of the field with clone, and then change the new fields id, the attached events won't copy over/work, right?
[12:42:45] <jedimind> you know you're doing something wrong when you need 31 revisions of a fiddle to fix 10 lines of js
[12:42:46] <MistuhKurtz> dangit what are the bot commands
[12:42:54] <MistuhKurtz> jedimind, ouch
[12:43:01] <jedimind> <3
[12:43:20] <imachuchu> MistuhKurtz: I'll go look at on and see what I can divine out
[12:43:30] <MistuhKurtz> imachuchu, see the jquery docs for on()
[12:43:40] <imachuchu> MistuhKurtz: ok I will
[12:43:59] <MistuhKurtz> or delegate. on is a wrapper for delegate.
[12:44:52] <imachuchu> MistuhKurtz: kk I'll look at both (but api.jquery.com is down/not working for me :(
[12:45:17] <MistuhKurtz> oh crap didn't realize that.
[12:46:24] <imachuchu> MistuhKurtz: kk it's back up (at least for me)
[12:46:37] <imachuchu> hmm, more or less
[12:46:41] <MistuhKurtz> yes, kind of
[12:46:42] <MistuhKurtz> hah
[12:47:04] <MistuhKurtz> imachuchu, http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:56:32] <sanguisdex> how can I make a form submit when as soon a value is changed?
[12:57:47] <imachuchu> sanguisdex: I use a focusout test on each of the fields/shared class that then checks to make sure all fields have data in them
[12:58:07] <sanguisdex> imachuchu: sounds like a plan
[12:58:51] <imachuchu> sanguisdex: (I'm posting it partially to help you and partially to see if anyone calls it stupid and suggests a better plan ;P )
[12:58:53] <scalex000> i need help
[12:59:12] <sanguisdex> scalex000: just ask a question
[12:59:21] <sanguisdex> imachuchu: neat!
[13:00:20] <scalex000> let me paste the code
[13:00:40] <scalex000> http://pastebin.com/EXtGHpMR
[13:01:28] <sanguisdex> scalex000: what's it supposed to do that its not?
[13:01:54] <scalex000> when I select an option, I want to get another data and fill a var
[13:02:07] <scalex000> its not complete
[13:02:15] <scalex000> because I dont know how to begin
[13:04:34] <karlheinz2> i'm looking for more functions that I can use on value here: $(divID).find('*').each( function(index, value) { ..... }
[13:04:51] <karlheinz2> such as getting the name attribute
[13:05:09] <karlheinz2> if its an input, etc.
[13:05:31] <NoiseEee> karlheinz2: hmmm?
[13:06:35] <karlheinz2> NoiseEee: OK, well concretely: how can I find out if an element is an input
[13:07:14] <ajpiano> $(this).is("input")
[13:07:20] <NoiseEee> .is
[13:07:26] <NoiseEee> sorry im trying to find a cache of the api docs
[13:07:27] <PrgmrBill> $(this).is("spinal tap");
[13:07:50] <karlheinz2> yeah the jquery api is done it appears
[13:07:59] <kswedberg> NoiseEee: just use http://jqapi.com/ for now
[13:08:03] <NoiseEee> thanks kswedberg
[13:08:10] <karlheinz2> any reason why its down?
[13:08:49] <kswedberg> karlheinz2: because we had to move it to a new server today, and it doesn't seem to like its new home.
[13:09:27] <kswedberg> same server setup and everything. should have been simple. but nothing ever is.
[13:10:11] <karlheinz2> nope it isn't
[13:19:00] <karlheinz2> so why did it take this long for libraries like jquery and mootools to come about
[13:20:13] <catcher> In the SS3 template parser, if I call MyMethod(true), is the parameter a bool or a string in the model/controller?
[13:20:39] <catcher> wrong chan :-P
[13:22:06] <toddWork_> html uses the title attr of an an input as a validation helper; how can i do the same thing w/ jQuery?
[13:22:11] <toddWork_> html5, i should say
[13:35:51] <kswedberg> NoiseEee, karlheinz2: api.jquery.com is back in action!
[13:39:06] <convivial> hello.
[13:40:00] <convivial> from javascript, how does one sbmit via post data to a php page
[13:40:16] <imachuchu> kswedberg: Hazzah!
[13:40:26] <KWhat_Work> convivial: you can form.submit or you can use ajax
[13:40:41] <convivial> examples?
[13:40:59] <bwq> yes
[13:41:04] <bwq> ? $.ajax()
[13:41:09] <bwq> ?? $.ajax()
[13:41:12] <bwq> just google that^
[13:41:15] <convivial> ok
[13:41:36] <bwq> the jquery site has good examples on how to use the api

[13:42:28] <julianhille> hi i have a select field which gets changed by a javascript. And an event change on that select field. If the js changes the data by .val() then the change event doesn't gets fired. is there a way to track that any way? i tried an change on the form and get currentTarget but thats empty.
[13:45:13] <karlheinz2> I'm trying to check if an input is a hidden field via this: if ( $(id).is("input") && $(id).is(':hidden') ) { ... }
[13:46:00] <slb_> i dynamically load images in a div and each is varying size, how can i get a horizontal scrollbar to work properly with this as i can not retrieve the sizes to set the exact width manually
[13:46:01] <karlheinz2> it's not working. any idea why not? --  id is a variable, not my literal
[13:47:41] <karlheinz2> I'm looking for hidden inputs, not invisible elements
[13:49:17] <NoiseEee> karlheinz2: $('#'+id) ?
[13:51:01] <karlheinz2> well I want to ensure that it's a hidden input, not just any input
[13:51:21] <NoiseEee> what is "id" ?
[13:51:26] <karlheinz2> and the selector is fine -- id is a variable as I said
[13:51:33] <karlheinz2> var id = "#" + whatever

[13:57:49] <karlheinz2> hmm, OK guys. I had that initially so there must be a problem with else
[13:58:25] <karlheinz2> I should start using jdfiddle
[13:58:40] <Justus> what would be the easiest way to generate a simple window to put other content in it?
[13:58:50] <Justus> in the style of jqueryui that is
[13:59:04] <Justus> a title would be nice but not necessary
[13:59:16] <Crumbz> Justus, in what sense?
[13:59:29] <Justus> just like a dialogbox but not moving or stuff
[13:59:48] <Justus> a simple div but in the loaded jquery ui style
[14:00:04] <Crumbz> $(parent).append('div')
[14:00:11] <Crumbz> or appendTo
[14:00:28] <Crumbz> check the jquery api doc for the difference
[14:01:53] <Justus> Crumbz: uhm... that doesn't do anything? it generates a div without style elements
[14:02:41] <Crumbz> Justus, well then use .css()
[14:02:57] <Crumbz> or create a css class
[14:03:42] <Justus> ok, from the start: I am using JQueryUI, I have a JQueryUI Style chosen, I want to have a standard window, in the style chosen for JQueryUI, the style it uses for buttons, dialogboxes and so on
[14:03:58] <Crumbz> ok
[14:04:07] <Crumbz> well have you looked in the jquery-ui css file?
[14:04:09] <Justus> no moving, no nifty effects, just a plain window in the style defined by the theme
[14:04:31] <Justus> so there is no such function
[14:04:43] <Justus> that was pretty much everything I was asking for...
[14:04:55] <Crumbz> have you looked in the jq css file?
[14:05:04] <niels__> am i using the pipes wrong in this condition? http://pastebin.com/Q0ZiuLpU first one is false, second one is false always. but it returns true?
[14:05:10] <Justus> yes I have, and last time I checked functions were not defined in css files
[14:05:48] <Crumbz> what are you talking about?? Youa re asking to create a window with the style of jqUI. just create the element then apply the already supplied stylesheet....
[14:07:47] <Justus> Crumbz: Yes, just create an element, then add 50odd classes to it, which classes to use you have to find out yourself as opposed to call $('<div>').window(); or something
[14:09:39] <Crumbz> jquery UI doesn;t create windows for you, it applies functionality to already created elements. if youw ant to create an element its as simple as $(parent).appendTo('div').addClass()
[14:09:51] <imachuchu> I've asked before (and got some good advice) but I'm having a problem with jquery-ui's autocomplete. I've attached it to a class that many fields share, and it works fine on all of them. When I clone one (and rename it) the newly cloned field doesn't have the autocomplete on it (which I would like). Any ideas?
[14:09:54] <Crumbz> you are trying to simplify an already simple process
[14:10:09] <Justus> ?! what classes do I give it?
[14:10:13] <imachuchu> and my attaching code looks like: $( document ).on( "focusin", ".nodcAutocomplete", function(){
[14:10:24] <Crumbz> Justus, read the style sheet and find out.
[14:11:34] <Crumbz> Justus, 10 seconds it took me: ui-widget-content
[14:12:25] <Crumbz> Justus, the section "/* Component containers" has all the basic container styles
[14:12:34] <Justus> ok, I didn't know that
[14:12:46] <Crumbz> Justus, neither did i. :)
[14:13:09] <Justus> sorry, I'm just getting to learn these functions and on the plus side I'm grumpy for rl reasons
[14:13:15] <Justus> shouldn't let that out on you
[14:13:19] <Justus> thanks for sticking with it
[14:13:45] <Crumbz> Justus, ok np. I have those days myself. :)  btw, you can use the chrome debugger, or firebug. im sure you knew that already though. :P
[14:13:58] <Justus> that was how I found out it did nothing ;)
[14:14:09] <Crumbz> :P
[14:23:10] <Pierce_Hawthorne> Is this for learners or developers?
[14:23:26] <Crumbz> Pierce_Hawthorne, learners
[14:23:35] <Pierce_Hawthorne> Hmm. This interests me.
[14:23:51] <Crumbz> Pierce_Hawthorne, best place to be :)
[14:25:18] <eip56> Pierce_hawthorne its for learners and developers alike.... have a question ask it.... have an idea share it... need some advice ask for it... need a coffee.... go buyt it yourself :-)
[14:25:37] <Crumbz> ^
[14:26:05] <Pierce_Hawthorne> Say I were to load new HTML in, and I had an existing function that modifies the html, how would I go about reintializing the modifying html function for the new content loaded in
[14:27:26] <eip56> Can you give us an example... and are you talking about utilizing something along the lines of .live()
[14:28:20] <convivial> thanks for help but i have it figured out
[14:29:22] <Pierce_Hawthorne> I'm not sure what.live() is. To be honest I'm not really sure what I;m doing. I'm trying to add on someones existing code. I'll try to explain it better with an example: A function modifies the html by replacing text that says "example" with "example2
[14:29:41] <Pierce_Hawthorne> after new content is loaded in, how would I get this script to run again?
[14:30:59] <Demonen> Pierce_Hawthorne: Call the function on it again?
[14:31:42] <LekeFly> I have a button that is binded to on click with: jQuery('input#options_1_3').prop("checked", "checked"); is there another way to get the radio checked? i need to simulate a click..
[14:32:09] <Pierce_Hawthorne> Demonen: I tried to place the function in the new content function, but it doesn't reload the html to replace from. Does that make sense?
[14:32:15] <Demonen> $('#someSelectorHere').click();
[14:32:29] <Demonen> Pierce_Hawthorne: Nope.
[14:33:07] <eip56> Pierce_Hawthorne my guess is the code you are using is a bit old. But what you have is a form correct. you type what you want replaced when you click the button its changes the text? or something similar?
[14:33:46] <eip56> Pierce_Hawthorne please go here and setup the code so we can see it http://jsfiddle.net/
[14:33:47] <LekeFly> Demonen: this is the whole code: https://gist.github.com/3146984
[14:35:00] <Demonen> LekeFly: Okay.  What's the problem with it?
[14:35:12] <Pierce_Hawthorne> Demonen: eip56: Well if I just want to replace something that is constant it works fine eg replace all example 1 with example 2. When I try to execute a function that uses unique variables for each one eg: for each wrapid replace uniquecodeforthisid with another uniquecodeforthisid2
[14:35:15] <LekeFly> Demonen: Just updated and added abit of description to https://gist.github.com/3146984
[14:36:13] <eip56> Pierce_Hawthorne please go here and setup the code so we can see it http://jsfiddle.net/ it will help us help you its really easy and fast
[14:36:51] <Demonen> LekeFly: $('#options_1_2').click() ?
[14:37:25] <Demonen> LekeFly: Why are you not just calleing opConfig.reload() ?
[14:37:35] <LekeFly> dunno how.. :P
[14:37:38] <Demonen> (or whatever it's called)
[14:37:41] <Demonen> Like this:
[14:37:42] <theere> hey what's the easiest way to do what i'm trying to do here: .html("hello" excerptText);
[14:37:49] <Demonen> opConfig.reloadPrice()
[14:37:50] <theere> like i want to enter some of my own html + the string
[14:37:58] <theere> its really siple i just don't know the syntax.
[14:38:04] <LekeFly> Demonen: Where would that be added to my jQuery('input#options_1_3').prop("checked", "checked");
[14:38:17] <Pierce_Hawthorne> eip56: Its for a wordpress theme im trying to modify. how would I simulate more posts being called in?
[14:38:22] <Demonen> LekeFly: The line below it.
[14:39:03] <eip56> theere $(selector).html('<p>hello</p>' + excerpt text); but if you are just changing the text and not adding html use .text()
[14:39:24] <LekeFly> Demonen: its not a jquery function(?) tho.. so is that possible?
[14:39:51] <Demonen> LekeFly: Just try it.  jQuery is just JavaScript.
[14:39:59] <eip56> Pierce_Hawthorne what do you mean simulate... basically press a button call some new text in?
[14:40:03] <Demonen> It's not some magic black box that has no contact with the rest of the world.
[14:40:12] <LekeFly> :D
[14:40:38] <Pierce_Hawthorne> okay I'll do that eip56
[14:41:21] <eip56> Pierce_Hawthorne I didnt give you any advice i was asking a question....
[14:42:11] <Pierce_Hawthorne> eip56: haha sorry I thought you were trying to tell me to use a button called text box to demo new stuff loading in
[14:42:51] <LekeFly> Demonen: Thanks for the patience.. this worked: https://gist.github.com/3146984 does it look correct?
[14:43:55] <Demonen> LekeFly: Yep, exactly as it should be :-)
[14:44:00] <theere> eip56: i am adding html borders, so I should use .html right?
[14:44:03] <LekeFly> Yay! thanks!:)
[14:44:23] <Demonen> theere: "html borders"?
[14:44:31] <theere> like div tags
[14:45:02] <Demonen> Well, yes, then .html('<div class="foo">'+somevar+'</div>');
[14:45:08] <eip56> if you are addming any tags then yes .html
[14:45:14] <Demonen> Because you need the divs to be parsed into the DOM
[14:45:42] <eip56> you could also $('<div></div>').appendTo, .before() .after() etc
[14:46:13] <Demonen> eip56: Basically the same thing, as that's what jQuery does behind the scenes when you .html ;)
[14:46:35] <Demonen> Except, of course, it doesn't have to rescan the whole HTML
[14:46:55] <Demonen> So yeah, if somevar is a lot of stuff, don't just .html
[14:47:04] <Demonen> .before() and .after() it
[14:47:10] <Demonen> Isn't there a .wrap)=
[14:47:14] <Demonen> ... wrap()?
[14:48:14] <theere> um, the excerpt is like 50 words
[14:48:20] <theere> is that considered "a lot"
[14:48:28] <Demonen> theere: No, that's nothing.
[14:48:30] <eip56> Theres all kinds of shenanegans... just make sure its lean code do as little s possible
[14:48:49] <eip56> yea and 50 words is nothing
[14:48:54] <Demonen> theere: Done once, or done a bunch of times?
[14:49:00] <eip56> I might save it in a var to keep the code clean tho
[14:49:15] <theere> 50 times
[14:49:17] <diverdude> Does this invoke the function init? $(Create.init);
[14:49:27] <theere> but i mean, does it really matter when its jquery
[14:49:32] <theere> isnt the point that the load is on someone's computer?
[14:49:56] <Demonen> I mean, once per forum post, showing 100 posts at a time, it starts to accumulate.
[14:50:21] <diverdude> any1?
[14:50:22] <Demonen> theere: It's THAT mentality that makes some websites SUCK to visit.
[14:50:27] <theere> hahaha
[14:50:37] <Demonen> theere: Yes.
[14:50:48] <Demonen> Err, I meant, diverdude: Yes.
[14:50:55] <theere> get faster computer -_-
[14:51:02] <Demonen> Or rather, ot does on DOM complete.
[14:51:15] <Demonen> theere: Write better code.
[14:51:34] <Demonen> My computer is ligtning fast, but it's got better things to do than your crufty JavaScript.
[14:51:36] <Lucky--> soo tired. question for you guys: I have been at this since 1am last night (no sleep) with prototype format var bla = {etc1:func1(){},etc2:} does the constructor go outside of hte closure like bla.prototype.constructor = function(){doSomething()}; ? thx
[14:51:56] <Lucky--> it seems like on google every damn result likes a different pattern, different style
[14:51:58] <diverdude> Demonen: then why not just use Create.init(); instead ?
[14:52:59] <Demonen> diverdude: The function referred to in $() runs on DOM complete.  Create.init() in clear will run as soon as the script is parsed, which doesn't mean the divs (or whatever) you are working against exist yet.
[14:53:37] <diverdude> Demonen: ahh ok thx
[14:53:41] <Demonen> Lucky--: That's because there's about a zillion ways to do it.
[14:53:53] <Demonen> diverdude: Dolby Digital
[14:56:09] <dabear> var Bla = function(){ /* this is the constructor */};
[14:56:32] <dabear> Bla.prototype = { bar: function(){}, baz: function(){}}
[14:56:59] <Lucky--> gotcha
[14:57:03] <Lucky--> so i can split up the closures
[15:00:59] <eip56> Whats considered better practice... to do a $(document).ready or a self invoking function
[15:01:24] <jyg> if I do $('#pdp #product-cannot-show').show() my container shows just fine, but if I do $('#pdp #product-cannot-show').show().delay(3000).hide();  it never shows (at least tht I can see)
[15:01:36] <jyg> eip56, depends on how fancy you are
[15:01:57] <eip56> lets put it this way... i hold my pinky up when i drink coffee
[15:02:27] <Lucky--> so I cant call the object methods in the constructor? :-(
[15:04:13] <eip56> so jyg i take it its just preferance
[15:04:47] <garrilla> $("#report").css('display','block') returns "Uncaught ReferenceError: display is not defined " - any idea why?
[15:05:55] <eip56> sounds like its not supporting display for some reason
[15:08:03] <garrilla> yeah, i thought that... but its a DIV
[15:08:37] <eip56> garrilla if you throw the code up on jsfiddle real quick ill take a look at it for you
[15:08:47] <StubbornTurtle> garrilla: what does $("#report") return?
[15:09:51] <eip56> And by default garrilla divs are displayed: block; they are block level elements
[15:10:52] <garrilla> yes, I know, but it is current set to 'display: none'
[15:11:06] <StubbornTurtle> garrilla: alternatively you could use $().show();
[15:11:43] <eip56> garrilla lets work off this

[15:13:47] <KWhat_Work> magic_: paste bin please
[15:13:48] <eip56> whoa magic_ hastebin that code
[15:14:02] <magic_> ^^ see it only catched input fields within td eelements
[15:14:10] <magic_> and returns the input.value thing
[15:14:31] <magic_> but i also want to make it support for div and plain just text
[15:15:06] <karlheinz2> i have an input element which can be disabled. if it's disabled, I want to create a hidden field on the fly (this works). If the input element is enabled, I want to remove hidden fields (if they exist) -- this part does not work
[15:15:21] <teear> 123
[15:15:44] <karlheinz2> they both have the same ID
[15:15:52] <magic_> http://jsfiddle.net/tPpdj/
[15:16:06] <danheberden> wait, two elements have the same *UNIQUE* identifier?
[15:16:06] <LekeFly> How can i see whats happening when i click a radio input? i know there is some js event(?) or function going off.
[15:16:38] <karlheinz2> danheberden: yes, however they aren't both enabled at the same time
[15:17:06] <magic_> thats the jsfiddle link trying to grab the data from input and other blocks also
[15:17:15] <magic_> but no success noob to javascript here
[15:17:25] <magic_> guys help me please :)
[15:18:05] <karlheinz2> danheberden: do you have a better idea?
[15:18:32] <danheberden> karlheinz2: i have no idea what your problem is. But I *do* know that having two elements with the same ID will definitely make whatever problem you're having worse
[15:18:42] <danheberden> as they are meant to be unique
[15:18:54] <danheberden> classes are fun for that - if you need something for multiple elements
[15:19:37] <danheberden> like when it's enabled, $('input[type="hidden"].myCoolClassName').remove()
[15:19:38] <garrilla> thanks everyone, I reolved it - typo #reprot !!!
[15:19:38] <danheberden> or whatever
[15:20:24] <karlheinz2> ah remove is what I want, not disable -- these are two separate things I assume
[15:21:58] <magic_> anyone ?
[15:22:44] <karlheinz2> danheberden: how do I check for an id as well in the statement you provided
[15:23:07] <ert3> anyone else getting tired of invite only rooms on freenode
[15:23:08] <danheberden> karlheinz2: if it's an id, it'd be the ONLY one
[15:23:09] <karlheinz2> its possible other hidden inputs are there
[15:23:12] <danheberden> so you'd just get the id
[15:23:23] <danheberden> hence the whole 'unique' part
[15:23:34] <danheberden> if an element has an id, just $('#theUniqueId')
[15:23:48] <blendedbychris> Do any of you know of a carousel that takes say 5 "li" items and just shifts them back and forth so each "li" get's centered?

[15:23:58] <ert3> no love

[15:24:29] <TelFiRE> Hello all! I have colorbox linking to inline content, which has a video (using Projekkter for HTML5 with flash fallback). If I click the thumb to see the video, then play the video, then close that window, then open the same video back up, I get a tiny video nested in the top corner of the original video. Any ideas how to avoid this behavior?
[15:24:49] <Justus> got a little problem here with the jqueryui effect slide, I set distance to 100 yet it slides the 100 then vanishes completely, any way to prevent it from the last part?
[15:24:55] <karlheinz2> danheberden: then maybe you can suggest a better way to do this: I want to prevent the user from changing a value (hence I make it disabled) and I create a hidden input that mirrors the value of the now-disabled element)
[15:25:33] <danheberden> so create an element with the same name and make it type="hidden"?
[15:25:38] <karlheinz2> danheberden: I chose to do it this way because select boxes can't be set to read-only
[15:26:21] <karlheinz2> danheberden: ah, that makes more sense. I can just make the id the same but append _hidden or something
[15:26:27] <karlheinz2> I don't know why I didn't think of that
[15:27:02] <danheberden> karlheinz2: why you so stuck on id's
[15:27:04] <danheberden> forget the id
[15:27:12] <danheberden> they already have a name
[15:27:13] <karlheinz2> why?
[15:27:14] <danheberden> and a type
[15:27:19] <danheberden> that's unique already
[15:27:22] <karlheinz2> yeah I suppose
[15:27:22] <danheberden> you have select[name="whatever"]
[15:27:28] <danheberden> and input[type="hidden"][name="whatever]
[15:27:36] <danheberden> like, you might be over thinking it
[15:27:42] <karlheinz2> well at this point I'm not super great with jquery
[15:27:47] <danheberden> you'll get there! :D
[15:27:49] <karlheinz2> right now I want something functional, I can refine later

[15:53:41] <io__> hi using .hover if i hover too fast on elements the function is not called properly, is there a fix for it? for example an image i am fading in, it doesn fadeout if I move out the pointer too quickly
[15:55:43] <Whirl3d> io___ I don't use hover thought it is supposedly only a shortcut...I just animate both the mouseenter and mouseleave events and set my queue:false in my animations to fade
[15:56:15] <Whirl3d> Not saying that mine is the right or only way, but you could try that. If you post your code to jsfiddle we could take a look at it.
[15:57:23] <LekeFly> Is this code correct? https://gist.github.com/3146984 doesnt seem the last line does anything
[15:58:26] <Whirl3d> LekeFly, there's no need to ad the element nodetype before an id selector. $("#id") is better than $(
[15:58:33] <Whirl3d> "div#id");
[15:59:16] <LekeFly> alright.. what about opConfig.reloadPrice() should there be a , or ; after?
[15:59:23] <Whirl3d> and the thing is that without a working (or not working) example of your code, there's no way to guess
[15:59:28] <Whirl3d> a ;
[15:59:54] <Whirl3d> try it in jsfiddle and it will show your console errors where that would be clearly indicated
[16:00:24] <LekeFly> Both should have a ; after?
[16:02:30] <scalex000> I want to share a code I get error.
[16:03:03] <scalex000> http://pastebin.com/gRniMtPJ
[16:03:26] <scalex000> this var statelist not have data
[16:03:55] <Whirl3d> try it in jsfiddle if you want me to help. Otherwise, maybe someone else will help you.
[16:05:41] <sente> fairuz: how did you make out with your data?
[16:09:01] <Crumbz> guy's if i'm creating an element like so: $(foo).append(bar)  : how do i retain a reference to bar?  var obj = $(foo).append(bar); will just retain foo as a reference
[16:09:26] <Whirl3d> you could use appendTo
[16:09:37] <Whirl3d> bar.appendTo(foo);
[16:09:52] <Whirl3d> var elem=bar.appendTo(foo);   elem is the item appended
[16:10:34] <Crumbz> ahh ok, thanks

[16:26:24] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:26:38] <Lucky--> wow. axing all jquery selector calls condensing them all into one closure and just referencing that tripled the speed of my app.
[16:32:16] <veebers> hi all, if I do something like: var all_spans = $('span', $(this).parents('div.some_container');
[16:32:49] <veebers> should I be able to this: var specific_span = $('span.class_name', $(all_spans)); ?
[16:36:17] <MistuhKurtz> Lucky--, nice. Yeah, too many selector calls and not enough variables make jquery a slow boy
[16:36:47] <MistuhKurtz> veebers, no need to reference jQuery a second time
[16:37:34] <veebers> MistuhKurtz: so this should work? var specific_span = $('span.class_name', all_spans);
[16:39:21] <MistuhKurtz> yes
[16:39:47] <MistuhKurtz> you're missing a closing ) on the first line
[16:40:44] <veebers> MistuhKurtz: cool thanks, I must be doing something else wrong
[16:41:06] <MistuhKurtz> why, what's wrong? if you make a jsfiddle I'll help
[16:43:33] <veebers> MistuhKurtz: oh well the example I pasted was simplified from the code I'm working on
[16:43:49] <veebers> which isn't behaving (i.e. the 2nd part returns nothing)
[16:44:01] <veebers> so I suspect I'm doing something silly, just re-checking now
[16:44:06] <MistuhKurtz> nm a jquery object/collection is perfectly acceptable for the context selector

[17:40:59] <LindsayMac> anyone here???
[17:41:08] <azbyin> http://jsfiddle.net/yQmu4/
[17:41:39] <azbyin> the width property of the select dropdown does not include the width of the arrow

[17:42:47] <LindsayMac> Orrrr not.
[17:42:48] <LindsayMac> ALMOST did
[17:42:50] <LindsayMac> Dern..
[17:43:25] <LindsayMac> If someone has a moment or wants to take a look.. can you tell me why my "add another" is only adding one and no addition elements? http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/sRQLA/2/

[17:45:30] <djaniel10> I am using fadein to make a picture appear after the page loads. I was looking for a way to make the image appear moving toward the user. is there anyway to accomplish this effect?
[17:46:14] <LindsayMac> djaniel10:  I would assume that making it bigger will give it the appearance of moving closer
[17:47:45] <djaniel10> LindasyMac: True, thanks i am pretty new to jquery i can i make the image larger?
[17:48:16] <LindsayMac> the same way you did the fade in, but just change the height/width
[17:48:19] <LindsayMac> .animate
[17:48:52] <djaniel10> for fadein i used $("img").fadeIn(2000);
[17:49:01] <LindsayMac> Wooo fixed my problem again..
[17:49:13] <LindsayMac> So you would use .animate

[17:57:47] <LindsayMac> Why is it so quiet in here tonight?
[18:22:38] <scalex000> hi,
[18:24:14] <LindsayMac> hi
[18:57:15] <bindi> how can I get the id of the last div inside a div?
[18:58:06] <bindi> <div id="blah"><div ../><div ../><div id="moo"></div></div> <- for example, 'moo' from that
[18:58:08] <Flumpy> $('div div:last-child').attr('id')
[18:58:16] <Flumpy> Something along those lines, I imagine
[18:58:17] <bindi> lets see
[18:58:51] <azbyin> bindi, $("#blah div:last-child").attr("id")
[18:59:52] <bindi> yes indeed, thank you
[19:00:11] <MistuhKurtz> bindi, not the distinction between :last-child and :last
[19:00:23] <MistuhKurtz> :last-child is the last child element, whether its <div>, <p>,  etc.
[19:00:39] <MistuhKurtz> :last is the last DIV-only element
[19:01:21] <MistuhKurtz> so div:last-child would not match #foo in <div /><div id="foo" /><p />
[19:01:21] <bindi> can I filter it with a certain class too only?
[19:01:36] <MistuhKurtz> sure
[19:02:28] <MistuhKurtz> $("#foo div.bar:last")
[19:02:43] <bindi> ah
[19:02:44] <MistuhKurtz> that would match the last div with the class bar inside #foo
[19:02:45] <bindi> yes, thank you
[19:03:25] <MistuhKurtz> np, just make sure whether :last or :last-child is what you need
[19:03:35] <bindi> yeah checking that out
[19:22:54] <veebers> hmm, if I have something like: $('div.details', $(this).parents('div.details_wrapper'));
[19:22:57] <veebers> inside a $('...').delegate('a', 'click', func...
[19:23:11] <veebers> why would it return something on the first click, but nothing on any subsequent clicks?
[19:24:23] <andrewhl> I'm trying to select a specific DOM element and perform an action on every OTHER element of the same type. I'm assigning the selected element to a variable, and looping through an array of all the elements of that type and trying to compare the selected one to the others. It doesn't work, though. All comparisons return false. http://jsfiddle.net/
[19:24:45] <andrewhl> The console output is: No match (four times)
[19:25:27] <andrewhl> Is there an easy way to do this? On, say, a click event for the selected element, to hide all the other elements of the same type except the selected one?
[19:25:37] <veebers> hmm, I think I've found it. Looks like I'm changing  something dumb
[19:47:59] <MistuhKurtz> veebers, what was it? My first guess is you have return false; in there
[19:48:36] <veebers> MistuhKurtz: heh, a little embarrassing but I was removing the class on that div within that callback :P
[19:48:43] <MistuhKurtz> lol :)
[19:48:54] <veebers> so first time could find it, 2nd time wasn't there to find
[19:49:04] <veebers> oops, XD

[19:55:00] <cordoval> actually span with attributes
[19:55:16] <sente> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6938286/217652
[19:55:23] <bindi> http://bindi.shroudbox.net/feedz/comment.php - how come this is saying "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token } comment.php:23" when I click "show comments"?
[19:55:31] <bindi> <a href="#" onclick="javascript:LataaKommentit($(this).closest("div.julkaisu").attr("id"));">show comments</a>
[19:55:33] <sente> so that's an old answer to the radio elements
[19:55:43] <bindi> ahhh i need ' instead of "
[19:56:05] <bindi> stupid me.. weird error though
[19:57:29] <cordoval> hmmm not quiet
[19:57:33] <cordoval> quite
[20:24:25] <phonebook_> does anyone want to do a random number generator expirement with me?
[20:24:40] <sente> phonebook_: go on...
[20:25:06] <phonebook_> was watching science channel about how people can change random number generators with their mind so im writing one to try it
[20:25:10] <juha_> phonebook_: i will randomly choose the number 8
[20:25:12] <phonebook_> writing in c#, should be done in a sec
[20:25:28] <sente> i will also randomly choose the number 8
[20:26:02] <sente> phonebook_: take my poll: http://sente.cc/wsgi/number_poll
[20:26:36] <juha_> bindi: please don't do that.. that is just horrible
[20:26:45] <bindi> juha_: how come?
[20:28:02] <juha_> bindi: let's say you have 500 of those links, horrible to maintain, makes the page heavier to load. instead to something like this $("a").click(function(e) {e.preventDefault();LataaKommentit($(this).closest("div.julkaisu").attr("id"));});
[20:28:18] <juha_> bindi: also it can interfere with other events to that selector
[20:28:48] <bindi> I can do $("a .myclass") right?
[20:29:00] <bindi> or is it a.myclass.. anyway
[20:30:43] <juha_> bindi: both are correct, but for different selectors, but yes
[20:31:13] <phonebook_> 200 times a second ought to be enough random numbers
[20:31:17] <juha_> bindi: $("a") would bind to all links which is not what you might want, but as your html did not have a class/id, i gave you that example
[20:31:32] <bindi> juha_: working on the page, very plain.. that'd be why
[20:31:47] <bindi> so if I were to use <a class="moo">, do I want a.moo or a .moo
[20:31:53] <bindi> could just test but busy on something else atm
[20:32:24] <juha_> bindi: exactly
[20:32:31] <bindi> "a or b"
[20:32:36] <bindi> "exactly"
[20:32:39] <bindi> whut? :P
[20:32:47] <juha_> bindi: using onclick attribute on the link is horrible to maintain
[20:33:01] <juha_> bindi: i don't know, i haven't slept in 24 hours
[20:33:08] <bindi> right.. :)
[20:33:41] <veebers> If I have a normal array of strings, is there much overhead using $.each(blah, func...) or should I just use a basic for-loop?
[20:35:20] <jasonenglish> veebers: http://jsperf.com/for-vs-each-vs-each/2
[20:36:02] <veebers> cool, cheers jasonenglish will read now
[20:37:32] <juha_> jsperf is awesome, i love it
[20:37:58] <ngharo> for loop: mmmmmmonster kill

[20:42:59] <phonebook_> home made weji board in 10, 9...
[20:46:17] <phonebook_> okay all systems go
[20:48:34] <phonebook_> there she blows http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l493/powerfulcrunch/randomnumbers.png
[20:49:04] <phonebook_> okay anyone willing to use their psychic powers to alter the number generator pls do so now
[20:49:14] <Salt> hello, I've captured an array of elements with jquery, now I want to take element i and print it as a string or someway enter it's contents into a lengthy string. element[i].html and to_S haven't done anything and I was wondering if anyone has dealt with this before?
[20:50:06] <juha_> phonebook_: i'm sticking onto the 8
[20:50:24] <phonebook_> i think i saw an 8!
[20:50:40] <juha_> psychic!
[20:51:31] <phonebook_> its on another thread so it constantly updates and then restarts every minute
[20:51:48] <phonebook_> that would be the balls if you could make it go up just by thinking it at it
[20:57:22] <tash> if I click on the button in this ( http://pastebin.com/e5hd8zFb ) and want to console.log the value of name="start", name="end", and name="value" ... could I do something like row = $(this).parent().parent(); then someone find the names with the row var?  Or, maybe if someone could just give me some tips I could try ...
[20:58:31] <tash> s/someone/somehow
[20:58:45] <tash> first occurence :)
[20:58:52] <tash> argh, I can't type for crap tonight
[21:01:00] <bnm> $('[name="start"]') won't work?
[21:01:03] <ParadoxQuine> hey is there a way to set left: 50% via offset() or css()?
[21:01:21] <andrewhl> I've got four divs, each with a header and a 'section'. Clicking the header slide toggles the sibling section. I want it to also close any OTHER sections that might be open. How can I do this? http://jsfiddle.net/zWQ5C/
[21:01:26] <bnm> .css( { left: '50%' } )
[21:01:39] <ParadoxQuine> doesn't seem to be working
[21:02:03] <tash> bnm: how so?
[21:04:12] <tash> bnm: I tried this earlier ... row = $(this).parent().parent(); start = row.find( "td[name=start]" ).val();
[21:04:22] <tash> console.log(start); says undefined
[21:05:32] <juha_> tash: <td name="start"> ?
[21:06:46] <ParadoxQuine> andrewhl: i think one of the better ways is to apply a class to it, like "selected",then close all the ones that are not "selected". I think there's also a way to get the original results of the selector expression minus the element you just told to open, but i'm drawing a blank on the exact function
[21:07:42] <tash> juha_: ugh!
[21:07:46] <tash> can't believe I did that
[21:07:54] <tash> it's actually in <input> in the td
[21:07:57] <tash> so let me try to fix that
[21:08:08] <bnm> ParadoxQuine: here it works http://jsfiddle.net/C5Xmf/
[21:08:08] <andrewhl> ParadoxQuine: I'll try the class approach. If the method comes back to you, please let me know. I'd love to know it.
[21:09:19] <ParadoxQuine> bnm: correct me if im wrong, but that code should have foo indented 50% right? it certainly isn't doing that on my browser o.O
[21:09:52] <tash> much better
[21:10:00] <bnm> nope, it shouldn't ===> in fact it isn't indented.
[21:10:06] <tash> juha_: thanks for pointing that stupid mistake out
[21:10:09] <bnm> Look at the page source or use the browser inspector, you'll see left:50% in the style=""
[21:10:34] <ParadoxQuine> nvm it was missing position absolute to get it to appear correctly
[21:10:47] <ParadoxQuine> i wonder why its not working in my app...hm
[21:11:24] <bnm> maybe it's not invoked, try some alert()-style debugging
[21:12:11] <juha_> tash: no problem
[21:12:22] <bnm> or whatever... it was just a guess of course
[21:18:40] <phonebook_> my random number generator is ready if anyone wants to play
[21:18:56] <phonebook_> all you have to do is think of a color and i will try to guess what it is
[21:19:19] <juha_> ok
[21:19:23] <phonebook_> sweet
[21:19:28] <juha_> not a color
[21:19:36] <phonebook_> top or bottom?
[21:19:42] <juha_> left please
[21:19:51] <phonebook_> left or right?
[21:19:54] <juha_> top
[21:20:06] <phonebook_> lol
[21:21:23] <juha_> did i win?
[21:22:26] <bnm> what did you win?
[21:23:15] <juha_> i hope it's something awesome
[21:23:33] <juha_> maybe a human size teddy bear, with freaking laser beams attached to the head

[21:31:56] <sp1786> I am new to jquery. I have been assigned the following task: ON click of a particular record in a grid, another grid will open as a layer on top of it containing related information.In the newly opened grid we slect a row and the values selected get populated in the 1st grid columns.... How to achieve this..
[21:33:27] <SeekingGuidance> I would appreciate if someone could guide me w.r.t making a Popup that accepts some user input in a text box and then a submit button that does something in the background without disturbing the original page.
[21:36:44] <juha_> SeekingGuidance: confirm() is the simplest "popup", but there are tons of plugins and examples on the intertubes
[21:38:52] <sp1786> anybody who can guide
[21:38:59] <sp1786> ??
[21:40:05] <phonebook_> i just played with a guy in philosophy and guesses his color 4 out of 5 times
[21:40:11] <phonebook_> *guessed
[21:44:32] <asdf__> can someone help me with a problem i have with IE8
[21:44:52] <asdf__> iam reading this article http://www.aaronpeters.nl/blog/iframe-loading-techniques-performance?%3E
[21:44:56] <asdf__> but it didnt help
[21:45:14] <asdf__> my iframe is showing balck box and browser loading never stops
[21:46:34] <phonebook_> how do you trigger the load? by changing the src or injecting the iframe?
[21:47:05] <asdf__> iam trying to use the asynch iframe code
[21:47:05] <joshteam> on $.ajax -- what's the best way to call a function when the request start?
[21:47:13] <joshteam> to do some type of loading screen
[21:47:29] <asdf__> where do i put the script though?
[21:47:32] <asdf__> becuase iam using a cms
[21:49:07] <phonebook_> i would think you could put it anywhere
[21:49:18] <tash> I'm opening a form with .dialg( "open" );  ... editDialog.dialog( "open" ); ... I want to pass a variable to editDialog, can I do that?
[21:49:48] <asdf__> ok yeah i pasted that asynch code but no change
[21:49:59] <asdf__> browser still has green bars on full
[21:50:19] <phonebook_> inside $(document).ready(function() { setTimeout(function(){$("#iframeContainer").html(<iframe src="http://www.npr.org"></iframe);}, 5000});
[21:50:55] <asdf__> whats that code phonebook?
[21:53:16] <phonebook_> that would inject an iframe into the dom
[21:53:21] <phonebook_> which i think would run your page
[21:53:39] <asdf__> ok but my cms wont let me enter that
[21:53:58] <phonebook_> why use a timeout?
[22:23:58] <coldhead> so tired

[22:40:14] <coldhead> sigh
[22:51:29] <coldhead> welcome back, Takazudo
[22:55:54] <Nobita> i need two vertical sliding panel on a page is it possible
[22:56:33] <mindis|wurk> with this huge amount of information provided, yes
[22:57:24] <superlinux-hp> hi. using this code http://pastebin.com/YESjbvEG i am reading RSS XML files. now sites.xml coexists with the script, i can get a result. but when i make sites.xml a remote URL i don't get any results. how can I make it get results from remote?
[22:57:39] <Nobita> mindis|wurk: was that for me
[22:57:43] <mindis|wurk> yes
[22:58:44] <coldhead> superlinux-hp: you can't do cross domain AJAX
[22:59:11] <coldhead> you CAN use jsonp, maybe, if you can mess with the remote site and get it to wrap your stuff in a JSONP wrapper
[22:59:22] <sente> or use a proxy
[22:59:31] <coldhead> or use a proxy!
[22:59:39] <sente> which is very easy
[22:59:56] <sente> if you have a server of any sort really
[23:00:20] <superlinux-hp> sente, all I want is to make an RSS reader
[23:00:42] <sente> and you already have a list of rss feeds?
[23:00:50] <superlinux-hp> yes
[23:01:11] <sente> dont need no ajax for that
[23:01:32] <superlinux-hp> sente, imagine i have news feeds from BBC, and I want to parse the XML file
[23:01:44] <sente> i can imagine such crazy things
[23:02:18] <superlinux-hp> and I want to extract the info I want from the xml file.
[23:02:41] <sente> there are different kinds of rss
[23:02:59] <superlinux-hp> well i am going to deal with joomla's
[23:03:06] <superlinux-hp> well i am going to deal with joomla's RSS
[23:03:58] <superlinux-hp> it's for someone who wants to make a mobile application for his site.
[23:05:19] <Nobita> mindis|wurk: http://screencast.com/t/Tl9Bjy02GgBN this is the screen cast u might get help from this what i actually need
[23:06:18] <sente> vi ls
[23:06:19] <sente> ls
[23:06:34] <mindis|wurk> Nobita looks more like a css problem
[23:07:01] <sente> superlinux-hp: well that sounds like a silly thing to do
[23:07:05] <sente> but anyways
[23:07:06] <sente> http://j.mp/NChVaT
[23:07:11] <superlinux-hp> ok
[23:07:11] <sente> that shows you some rss / javascript processing
[23:12:03] <Nobita> i want sliding panel like this site http://www.apartments.com/ if i click on Search Apartment Rentals by Top Cities panel upper panel move upwords
[23:15:10] <mindis|wurk> i can't find anything like that on that site but you probably just want to manipulate the height of an object that has overflow hidden
[23:16:29] <asdf___> i was in here before asking about my iframes
[23:16:40] <asdf___> i have embedded youtube video but they appear as black box
[23:16:49] <asdf___> and ei8 shows loading bars all the time
[23:17:03] <asdf___> this problem only appears on ie8
[23:17:16] <mindis|wurk> Nobita ah found it. that's pretty trivial really with http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[23:18:02] <asdf___> but the video sometimes appears after a while what is happenign
[23:21:48] <Nobita> mindis|wurk: yeah i have worked on it already bt the problem is that my site's more tab is sliding panel and just above more tab i want to place view top cities panel like apartments.com i got the code from their site only bt they have used so much of jquery and its conflicting with mine so i wand another example like theirs
[23:22:37] <mindis|wurk> i don't see why you'd need to take code from their site for such a trivial thing
[23:24:10] <Nobita> mindis|wurk: u r correct but u can also see their footer is static and m not getting same another example as they have done it
[23:24:28] <abjorn> coldhead: http://webking.com/ this you?
[23:30:15] <coldhead> i wish!
[23:30:22] <coldhead> that's much better than my site
[23:30:32] <coldhead> http://coldhead.miketaylr.com/
[23:32:10] <mindis|wurk> that's pretty nice too
[23:34:10] <abjorn> coldhead: you're right it is
[23:35:57] <jonkersjoe> hi anyone know of a good file upload plugin ?
[23:37:09] <sente> jonkersjoe: depends how fancy you want to be
[23:37:45] <jonkersjoe> fancy
[23:38:03] <jonkersjoe> asynchronous upload that looks good
[23:38:09] <sente> yeah
[23:38:11] <sente> well even within that set
[23:38:14] <sente> there are levels
[23:38:21] <sente> i use http://sentedrop.com/upload
[23:38:27] <sente> upload some shit, see if you like the flow
[23:38:53] <sente> i forked a plugin a long time ago and made that
[23:38:58] <coldhead> this is also very popular https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[23:39:12] <coldhead> with nice fallbacks for the ancient browsers of yesteryear
[23:39:29] <sente> http://www.uploadify.com/
[23:39:38] <jonkersjoe> thanks sente
[23:39:44] <sente> no doubt
[23:39:52] <sente> jonkersjoe: i intentionally don't show the uploaded files
[23:40:07] <sente> jonkersjoe: the server side component is a CGI script, which is IDEAL
[23:40:10] <sente> because anyone can run that shit
[23:40:17] <sente> i can point it anywhere, easily
[23:40:25] <jonkersjoe> coldhead: Yeah I had a look at that one, but I saw table layouts and html5 components in there. which I was a bit worried about
[23:40:32] <sente> and have versions in perl,python and php
[23:40:52] <jonkersjoe> uploadify uses flash year ?
[23:40:56] <jonkersjoe> year * yeah
[23:42:45] <coldhead> jonkersjoe: blueimp is active on github so if any problems did arise you could get them fixed
[23:43:00] <jonkersjoe> ok good, thanks guys
[23:43:04] <coldhead> although sente is RIGHT HERE to fix your problems too which is probably more immediate
[23:43:09] <Lucky|Laptop> wheres the best place to use $(document).ready. I have a heck of a lot of code (a jquery based mobile app that first loads the framework) and the selectors are only firing correctly like 70% of hte time:?
[23:43:12] <sente> lol yes
[23:43:17] <Lucky|Laptop> its all in closures and such
[23:43:18] <sente> i'm the worst freelancer ever
[23:43:30] <sente> i just like people too much
[23:43:34] <sente> like *helping
[23:44:18] <Lucky--> great source of business
[23:44:19] <Lucky--> :-)
[23:44:28] <coldhead> Lucky|Laptop: ready() at the top or ready() at the bottom should both find the same thing -- that the document is already loaded
[23:44:40] <coldhead> it's already() readu()
[23:44:44] <coldhead> >: |
[23:44:51] <Lucky--> yea i have it at hte bottom right now :-/
[23:45:21] <Lucky--> I rewrote ALL of my code into OOP, and isolated one object of just selectors so I didnt keep have to hooking the things and degrading performance
[23:46:05] <sente> it doesn't matter where it goes
[23:46:38] <sente> because it's only triggered after the content's been rendered, as coldhead was saying
[23:46:54] * sente prefers the top, next to all the other javascript shit
[23:47:22] <Lucky--> hm
[23:47:55] <coldhead> maybe you'd care to link to a live demo, Lucky--
[23:47:58] <Lucky--> http://mobilepayday.azurewebsites.net/Scripts/payday.mobile.js if you look at the selectors enclosure (scroll past the minified crap) I'm wondering
[23:48:08] <Lucky--> the site is the root of that
[23:48:27] <Lucky--> why I have to call a jquery specific selector again to access my data yet the var is clearly stored and accessible
[23:48:48] <sente> jesus chris
[23:48:52] <Lucky--> lol I think I tried every damn pattern in there
[23:48:53] <Lucky--> lol
[23:49:04] <sente> please tell me this code was auto generated
[23:49:09] <Lucky--> sente, no man
[23:49:16] <Lucky--> i havent slept in 26 hours :-(
[23:49:18] <sente> Lucky----------------
[23:49:20] <sente> nor have i
[23:49:21] <Lucky--> lots and lots of adderal
[23:49:24] <diverdude> if i have several $(function(){}) and i want a specific of these to be executed first. how do i do that?
[23:49:28] <sente> lol you're my twin
[23:49:32] <Lucky--> lol
[23:49:39] <sente> where you live?
[23:49:42] <Lucky--> so cal
[23:49:48] <shoky> diverdude: they are called in the order you call them
[23:49:53] <Lucky--> im actually on my hammock on my laptop rt now
[23:50:03] <Lucky--> drinking a rockstar :-)
[23:50:11] <diverdude> shoky: i dont call them...they are called automatically
[23:50:21] <Lucky--> but yea writing all this shit SUCKED
[23:50:23] <shoky> i mean, they are called in the order you add them
[23:50:26] <Lucky--> but its worth it
[23:50:35] <Lucky--> esp when I hate front end work :-(
[23:51:02] <sente> i'm on my porch with my legs on the railing
[23:51:05] <juha_> front end is da bomb
[23:51:41] <sente> but dude, fuck your code
[23:51:54] <juha_> sente is codesexual
[23:51:58] <Lucky--> lol
[23:52:26] <sente> line 785 should be 'https://...' not 'https=//...'
[23:52:31] <Lucky--> LOL
[23:52:35] <Lucky--> refernce my comment earlier
[23:52:39] <Lucky--> about thinking that find and replace
[23:52:46] <Lucky--> of : and = is a horrible idea.
[23:52:54] <Lucky--> especially when you are hopping between languages
[23:53:03] <Lucky--> so syntaxually it doesnt pop out at you till you rip it apart

[23:57:38] <juha_> Lucky--: anyways, i maintain userpics.com which has 15k - 20k daily unique visitors and i need to figure out how to monetize it a bit

[23:59:03] <Lucky--> I saw how much call rooms were making and I was a DBA, I wrote one a report and it dropped their CPA and increased profits for them over $35k a month
