[04:10:55] <loginoob> why does grunt gives error on jquery.mobile-1.4.5.js file
[04:11:15] <loginoob> linting errors
[04:11:41] <loginoob> like exepected an assignment or function call and insted saw expression
[04:12:00] <loginoob> what can I do to propley execute grunt
[04:15:15] <AdamPDotty> man propley
[04:16:37] <loginoob> *properly
[04:16:42] <loginoob> sorry
[08:18:27] <EugenA> how can I bind click event to container div, but not to elements in that container?
[08:19:32] <AdamPDotty> container.on('click', elementSelector, handler);
[08:20:47] <EugenA> $(document).on('click', '.container-debug', function(event) {...});   my container has some input fields, if I click on them, click-event happens again
[08:21:42] <EugenA> maybe .unbind() could help me...
[08:21:59] <AdamPDotty> oh, I misread
[08:23:18] <EugenA> or do I need to make somethink like stopPropagation() ?
[08:24:37] <Cork> what you want is $('div').on('click', function(event) { if($(event.target).closest('.not-this').length > 0) { return } /* normal event */ });
[08:24:50] <Cork> and no you DON'T want stopPropagation
[08:25:39] <Cork> if you want to exclude all child elements you can just check if event.target == this
[08:27:29] <EugenA> if (event.target === this) is exactly what I need, thanks!
[08:47:09] <admin__> Sorry for the username just some default
[08:47:50] <admin__> https://api.jquery.com/position/ - The text to example is wrong
[08:48:25] <Cork> what's wrong about it?
[08:48:29] <admin__> "Access the position of the second paragraph" should be "Access the position of the first paragraph"
[08:48:59] <Cork> heh true
[08:49:10] <Cork> well donno where you file bugs about the docs
[08:49:46] <admin__> I thought maybe some admin were on here
[08:51:33] <Cork> admin__: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues
[08:52:05] <Cork> admin__: or provide a pull request for https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries/position.xml
[08:52:29] <AdamPDotty> Can it be that easy?
[08:53:36] <admin__> i just posted it on there
[08:53:38] <admin__> im at work so
[08:53:43] <admin__> this should do it
[08:53:44] <admin__> :D
[11:21:32] <guideX> is there such a thing as a limited version of jquery, where I can pick and choose the features I need by chance?
[11:22:53] <tilerendering> hi
[11:24:27] <tilerendering> sorry for my “noob” question, but is there a good graphical jquery multi tabbed form builder online, preferrably responsive, with which I can build a multitabbed responsive form based on jquery and then download the html/css/js ? I tried “formbuilder” but their multitabbed example doesnt allow that… problem: my frontend dev went crazy and dropped out of the project spontaneously, and even if he comes back, I dont want to rely on his if
[11:24:29] <tilerendering> not necessary
[11:24:52] <tilerendering> his=him
[11:38:50] <tilerendering> great :(
[12:12:29] <chasepeeler> I've tested this out, and it appears to be how things work, but can someone confirm: $.when(d1,d2,d3).then(...).fail(...)   will only execute the then callback if all deferreds are successful. If just ONE of them fails, then fail() will be executed, and then() will not
[12:16:58] <chasepeeler> ugh, but it appears that it calls fail as soon as just one of them fails.... doesn't wait until they have all completed
[12:50:36] <catbadger> hey, this is relevant: https://medium.com/@melissamcewen/jquery-is-better-than-react-cd02dfb026a6
[12:50:50] <catbadger> but i want to make $250/hr
[12:50:52] <catbadger> ...
[12:52:34] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:52:47] <MikeD_> $250/hr ... sure, but can you sustain that rate for 40hr/wk and 50wk/yr ?
[12:56:21] <robertmaxrees> that article is also beginning with a bad premise.
[12:57:57] <grapheti> How can you compare jQuery to React? LOL
[12:59:53] <robertmaxrees> also: that $250/hr number isn't qualified at all.  probably contracting out to a company, not a person.
[13:02:50] <catbadger> lol likely
[13:02:55] <grapheti> [Insert any library and framework here] is super sexy and I want to learn it sooooo baaaaaaaaad.
[13:03:07] <catbadger> rofl
[13:03:24] <catbadger> just liked seeing that jquery isn't a junker yet. I AM RELEVANT! XD
[13:03:41] <grapheti> This article is a bunch of buzzword fluff and generalizations.
[13:03:45] <grapheti> garb
[13:05:15] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a great tool.  like lots of others.
[13:05:42] <grapheti> Especially with cross-site compatibility.
[13:05:48] <grapheti> Hell, it can even be used with react.
[13:06:07] <grapheti> You can even take parts out you don't need.
[13:07:50] <catbadger> it's a good tool. I just wish that the skill hadn't comodotized to such a low rate of pay. I feel like when you take a huge student loan, after 10 years in the industry, you should be able to support a family on one income in a rural area...
[13:08:22] <catbadger> without having to learn every fad framework that shows up
[13:08:24] <robertmaxrees> so
[13:08:33] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of it the wrong way heh.
[13:08:37] <grapheti> ^
[13:08:51] <robertmaxrees> people attach their names to specific frameworks and technologies, which is a baaaaad idea.
[13:08:59] <robertmaxrees> you're not a jquery dev - you're a dev.
[13:09:09] <robertmaxrees> you happen to know jquery.  you can also learn plenty of other tools.
[13:09:18] <catbadger> truth
[13:09:29] <robertmaxrees> if you're working freelance, there's rarely a good reason to mention the specific tools you're using.
[13:09:42] <robertmaxrees> you're client shouldn't care so long as what you deliver works and works well.
[13:10:14] <robertmaxrees> *your
[13:10:21] <grapheti> So you're telling me I'm a problem-solver?
[13:10:35] <robertmaxrees> it's almst like programming is thinking, not typing.
[13:11:01] <grapheti> Programming is more about the idea.
[13:11:11] <grapheti> Forget coding and think about a plan to do whatever.
[13:11:13] <grapheti> Then code.
[13:11:16] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:13:17] <grapheti> If you don't have a plan or pseduo-code beforehand, your code is prolly going to be horrible. You need to "think" about how it's going to work.
[13:14:11] <grapheti> Hell, draw it on a paper or w/e.
[13:14:21] <grapheti> Whatever it takes to have it in your head.
[13:16:00] <grapheti> Also, that article is garbage cause there's not a lot of context. Everyone already knows not to use monolithic libraries or frameworks for a brochure site. It's not teaching anyone what they don't already know. The tool depends on the project.
[13:23:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue that plenty of people don't know that, though.
[13:24:19] <grapheti> sad
[13:24:38] <robertmaxrees> people find the shiny hammer and want to hit every nail with it.
[13:28:03] <grapheti> lmao
[13:28:22] <Pankaj> Hi
[13:31:19] <Pankaj> Hi
[13:32:43] <catbadger> @robertmaxrees well said.
[13:32:51] <catbadger> sorry for delay, i'm at my dayjob
[13:33:48] <catbadger> I consult and I work a full-time job. 2 kids and a wife and there's nothing for retirement after that. the taxes on the consulting income are crippling me. I can't afford to stay a dev...
[13:34:03] <catbadger> sadface.
[13:34:19] <catbadger> I make around what an apprentice makes.
[13:34:46] <catbadger> so if i dropped my decade of experience and went and hammered nails with a literal shiny hammer, i'd make enough to support my family within 5 years.
[13:35:52] <catbadger> therefore, shiny hammer wins when it pays better.
[13:37:53] <grapheti> Is your full-time job dev?
[13:37:56] <catbadger> yes
[13:38:22] <grapheti> Dev jobs around me pay great.
[13:39:03] <grapheti> And I pay child support with one kid.
[13:39:24] <catbadger> according to wagescale, some jobs around me pay great.
[13:39:30] <catbadger> never actually seen those wages.
[13:40:40] <grapheti> You'll prolly in a better city than me.
[13:40:43] <grapheti> I'm in Oklahoma City.
[13:40:45] <grapheti> lol
[13:40:47] <catbadger> haha kelowna
[13:40:53] <catbadger> I'm in Canada
[13:41:03] <grapheti> Canada has great jobs.
[13:41:08] <grapheti> %esp Toronto
[13:41:08] <catbadger> 2/3rds of our dev team is in china
[13:41:23] <grapheti> Sounds like you need a new job.
[13:41:29] <catbadger> I'm in BC, other side of the continent from toronto. also cost of living eats those wages
[13:41:48] <catbadger> you might get 70k in toronto, but your rent is $4000 a month for a 1bed
[13:42:04] <grapheti> Maybe outside of it.
[13:42:11] <grapheti> I've never been to Canada.
[13:42:17] <grapheti> I want to go sometime tho.
[13:44:02] <catbadger> if you're under 30, try montreal, if youre over 30 try vancouver
[13:44:04] <catbadger> ;)
[13:44:54] <grapheti> I'm 2 years over.
[13:45:07] <catbadger> vancouver is a great city with lots to do
[13:45:10] <catbadger> very expensive though
[13:45:18] <grapheti> $$$$
[13:45:35] <catbadger> Montreal is a party city. great in your 20s.
[13:45:55] <catbadger> anyway my break is over </bitching>
[13:45:58] <catbadger> see ya :)
[13:46:03] <grapheti> I want to go to a city where I don't speak any of the language and they don't speak mine and make a friend.
[13:46:06] <grapheti> You're good.
[13:46:09] <grapheti> See ya.
[18:56:46] <guideX> any idea why I'm getting the error "Syntax error unrecognized expression [href=#] with this code "$header.find('[href=#]').on('click', function(e) {"
[18:57:07] <guideX> it broke when I went from jquery 1.10 to jquery 3
[18:59:26] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xhg3mwqr/1/
[18:59:33] <robertmaxrees> need to wrap the value in ""
[19:00:29] <guideX> nice :) thanks
[21:55:33] <aro> i am using a bootstrap jquery multi select dropdown and its not displaying my vertical scrollbars in IE, the page is: https://www.electrifyamerica.com/submissions
