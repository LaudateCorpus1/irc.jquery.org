[03:37:26] <TubbyTommy__> The jquerymobile.com front page is confusing. Is version 1.4.5 not compatible with any version of jQuery?
[03:41:08] <TubbyTommy__> Wake up you slothful generation.....
[06:51:54] <diverdude> Hi, I have a somewhat different usecase. I want to do an async call where i get 2 strings back. one is a bunch of javascript code, and the other is a bunch of html code. I want to replace an older version of javascript and html blocks on my site. The html part is simple enough, but is it somehow possible to delete a <script> block and replace it with a new?
[07:05:02] <Woet> diverdude: if your code is done properly you shouldn't have to do that.
[07:08:42] <diverdude> Woet: i am using a framework which forces me to do that
[07:09:01] <Woet> diverdude: i sincerely doubt it. and if it does, then it's time to stop using it.
[07:09:44] <diverdude> Woet: hehe :) its true in fact....and there is no alternative. Its the only framework of its kind....and its actually a really good framework'
[07:09:50] <`ULT> Hello, I have a problem. I have a simple code what is highlithing parent of checked radiobutton.
[07:10:02] <Woet> diverdude: can you explain how it forces you to "delete" a script block?
[07:10:13] <`ULT> Evertythink is working oke in Jsfiddle. But on my live site, it is not working.
[07:10:30] <`ULT> I think because of some ajax content generating
[07:10:43] <diverdude> Woet: because it encodes all the plotting glyps in the script plot. you can read about it. its called bokeh server
[07:10:59] <Woet> diverdude: if you say so.
[07:11:00] <diverdude> Woet: i am embedding plot in a website
[07:11:35] <Woet> `ULT: we can't help if you can't replicate it on jsfiddle, because that shows you haven't debugged it yet.
[07:11:41] <Woet> `ULT: jsfiddle has AJAX too btw.
[07:11:44] <diverdude> Woet: its basically the only plotting library out there which actually has some real functionality
[07:11:58] <`ULT> woet, I can show you first the jsfiddle
[07:12:18] <`ULT> this is the jsfiddle, I dont think there is anything wrong with the jquery.
[07:12:25] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/24jh03zs/
[07:12:29] <`ULT> dont check the html
[07:12:38] <Woet> diverdude: if you say so.
[07:13:05] <`ULT> like you can see, when you select a radio button it is highlited
[07:13:07] <Woet> `ULT: why havent you created a test case?
[07:13:17] <`ULT> this is the test case
[07:13:27] <`ULT> it is a real duplicate of the checkout
[07:13:29] <Woet> `ULT: its not, theres 1264 lines of HTML
[07:13:29] <`ULT> without the styling
[07:13:34] <Woet> `ULT: a test case is the opposite of a duplicate.
[07:14:17] <Woet> `ULT: and I'm not sure what you want me to do with a working jsfiddle.
[07:14:35] <`ULT> thats the problem Woet, on the live site this is not working.
[07:14:51] <`ULT> but my knowledge is very small. So I can`t reproduce the problem in a fiddle
[07:14:59] <Woet> `ULT: and? keep debugging it and find the actual issue.
[07:15:05] <Woet> `ULT: because clearly it's not in the code you shared.
[07:15:15] <`ULT> Oke thanks.
[07:15:41] <`ULT> Thank I think i`m stuck :p
[07:15:57] <Woet> `ULT: just keep removing parts of irrelevant code until you found the issue
[07:16:01] <`ULT> My knowledge is way to small to find what is realy going wrong in the live site.
[07:16:21] <Woet> `ULT: add console.log in the code so you can find out whats going on
[07:16:27] <Woet> `ULT: use the console to check for errors
[07:16:37] <`ULT> Yes, I did some testing.
[07:16:56] <`ULT> May I show you the real checkout?
[07:17:15] <`ULT> No need for looking deep into it, but only a quick look.
[07:17:21] <`ULT> I think what I want is not possible.
[07:17:28] <`ULT> because of the built of the checkout.
[07:17:41] <Woet> everything is possible
[07:17:50] <`ULT> May I pm you the link?
[07:18:20] <`ULT> so you can check what console.log ($(this).closest("div")); is in the real example.
[07:18:49] <Woet> you mean http://www.9bot.nl/ ?
[07:18:57] <Woet> its mentioned in your jsfiddle.
[07:19:00] <`ULT> yes that`s the test site indeed.
[07:19:02] <`ULT> right
[07:19:14] <`ULT> you can add product on cart
[07:19:17] <`ULT> and go to checkout.
[07:19:26] <`ULT> the jquery code is running
[07:19:47] <Woet> `ULT: not seeing any console.log output.
[07:20:18] <`ULT> you are right, 1 moment.
[07:20:37] <Woet> `ULT: and you will really have to turn it into a jsfiddle test case yourself.
[07:21:54] <`ULT> oke I will try, for some reason the code is now running not at all.
[07:22:03] <`ULT> no console.log indeed
[07:22:25] <Woet> and no offense, but and should probably reconsider whether you should be developing websites with limited knowledge
[07:22:37] <Woet> -and
[07:23:29] <`ULT> its my own website.
[07:23:48] <`ULT> so it is also for learning.
[07:24:29] <Woet> alright, fair enough then
[07:24:30] <Woet> :)
[07:32:41] <`ULT> Woet, can you take a quick look again? :)
[07:32:49] <Woet> `ULT: sure, link the jsfiddle with your test case
[07:32:50] <`ULT> The code is working now, and you can see what is happening.
[07:33:11] <`ULT> I mean 1 quick look into the live site, Than I will try to recreate this in jsfiddle.
[07:33:29] <`ULT> the code is running oke, after page load.
[07:33:41] <`ULT> but when clicking radiobutton, weird behave.
[07:35:54] <`ULT> But to be honest, I have now clue how I can reproduce this.
[07:36:12] <`ULT> the checkout is split in so many files.
[08:05:51] <`ULT> Woet, do you have seen it?
[08:06:19] <Woet> `ULT: turn it into a jsfiddle please, I'm not going to go through all that code
[08:07:09] <`ULT> but do you have seen the problem?
[08:07:11] <`ULT> or not?
[08:09:25] <iateadonut> i want to do a $('.class').each() in the .done() of a .post.  $(this) doesn't seem to be giving me the iteration; is there something i can use beside $(this)?
[08:11:25] <`ULT> I guess a normal reaction on a question is not possible, thx.
[09:37:57] <Jonuz> What I'm doing wrong when $(".content").first().closest(".asd"); wont find anything? https://paste.debian.net/909830/
[09:42:22] <shoky_> Jonuz: .closest looks UP the dom, to parents. you can use .next()  or .nextAll(".asd").first()   assuming they are siblings
[09:42:43] <Jonuz> Ah, thanks
[10:40:52] <TubbyTommy__> The jquerymobile.com front page is confusing. Is version 1.4.5 not compatible with any version of jQuery?
[10:46:29] <`ULT> woet, are you still there? ;)
[10:46:36] <`ULT> I found the line code what is causing the problem.
[10:48:23] <bbear> heyya
[10:49:50] <jak2000> bbear hi
[10:51:30] <`ULT> does some one knows what this is exactely doing?
[10:51:30] <`ULT>  update: function(data) {
[10:51:30] <`ULT>             if (data.shipping_method) {
[10:51:30] <`ULT>                 this.model.set('shipping_method', data.shipping_method);
[10:51:30] <`ULT>             }
[10:51:39] <`ULT> it is breaking some other code.

I have the settings to allow changing of month and year dropdowns. It works if embedded in the page, but in the modal the calendar shows, but the dropdowns open and then close when you initially click on it. Anyone else have this issue or any idea on how to correct it?
[12:33:14] <Forbidd3n> Nvm I found something that worked

[14:01:58] <minikN> Hello. I have some problems with POSTing an array to PHP via AJAX and I thought maybe one of you guys can help. I wrote this (https://jsfiddle.net/eLyvrx86/) script to simplify an AJAX request. I can feed it data like so: https://jsfiddle.net/49v2aska/ In this case, $('#categories') is a multiple select input. If I console log the data object before I send it, categories is indeed an array, something like ["1", "2"]. However,
[14:01:58] <minikN>  when I catch the input on the PHP end and dump it, it turned into a string (categories = "1,2"). If I POST it the conventional way it works. Any ideas what is happening?
[15:32:28] <dglambert> yo
[15:56:50] <segurb> can anyone help me: https://jsfiddle.net/qyo8nczg/6/ ?
[20:12:46] <Darmani> Hi everyone! I'm trying to replace the contents of some items when a user closes a window but nothing seems to change and there are no errors in the console :[
[20:12:47] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/6c8eb53e2e48aeb595892f8a45c05321
[20:15:27] <Darmani> oh nvm I got it.
[20:27:03] <Darmani> Is there a way to replace one div's contents with the contents of another div?
[20:29:29] <carpii> $("div#dest").html($("div#source").html());
[20:29:47] <carpii> might be a better way mind
[20:30:19] <carpii> http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/ perhaps
[20:30:48] <Darmani> carpii: Oh cool! I didn't know that was a thing c:
[20:31:06] <carpii> didnt know about replaceWith() either until now :)
[20:31:22] <Darmani> Seems like jQuery has a method for everything haha
[20:35:24] <carpii> heh yup, seems to :)
[20:39:29] <Darmani> carpii: $('.sunspot-search').replaceWith($('.search-instructions').html())
[20:39:41] <Darmani> Oddly this just makes that section of the DOM blank :[
[20:40:07] <carpii> you using chrome?
[20:40:20] <Darmani> yeah
[20:40:28] <carpii> open console and type packet_write_wait: Connection to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx: Broken pipe
[20:40:30] <carpii> uh heh
[20:40:31] <carpii> no, not that
[20:40:46] <carpii> open console and type $('.search-instructions').html()
[20:40:54] <Darmani> Does that make me a filthy casual?
[20:40:54] <Darmani> Lol
[20:40:59] <carpii> bear in any jquery selector can return multiple matches
[20:41:26] <carpii> and $('.sunspot-search') could match a whole heap of elements too
[20:41:55] <Darmani> carpii: They are unique. Nothing else like that here.
[20:42:01] <carpii> ok
[20:42:17] <carpii> so it suggests $('.sunspot-search').html() is returning an empty string
[20:42:43] <Darmani> I guess so.
[20:42:49] <carpii> from console try
[20:42:55] <carpii> $('.sunspot-search').replaceWith("FUCK");
[20:43:03] <carpii> sorry for obscenities, its my standard debugging string
[20:43:12] <Darmani> LOL
[20:43:15] <carpii> hehe
[20:43:19] <Darmani> that's awesome.
[20:43:19] <carpii> they get worse the more I debug
[20:43:53] <Darmani> hahahaha
[20:43:55] <Darmani> it works lmao
[20:46:08] <Darmani> carpii: the $('.search-instructions') is located in a partial that is in another folder
[20:46:11] <Darmani> Does that make a difference?
[20:47:18] <carpii> well jquery is runnig cleint side right, so folders shouldnt matter
[20:47:25] <carpii> it only needs to be in the browsers DOM
[20:47:25] <Darmani> q.q
[20:48:01] <Darmani> well it see's fuck
[20:48:03] <Darmani> we know that much
[20:49:19] <carpii> heh
[20:49:27] <carpii> always a good start :)
[21:06:04] <Darmani> carpii: Okay I know why. The $('.search-instructions') are there when the page first loads but I do some ajax and replace that part with the search results so it's not there anymore.
[21:06:09] <Darmani> god damn it lol
[21:06:19] <carpii> :p
[21:06:41] <carpii> gotta love dynamic content :)
[21:38:27] <TubbyTommy> Is the default color scheme in jQuery mobile text-color: white, background-color: black? I'm getting black on white which looks kinda plain.
[21:40:48] <carpii> check network tab in chrome to make sure jquery-ui css is actually loading
[21:40:54] <carpii> but yeah its intended to be neutral i think
[21:40:59] <carpii> make your own https://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/
[21:41:22] <TubbyTommy> oh I never downloaded that, I just downloaded the one .css file, I'll get the other now, thanks, I didn't see Chrome complaining about that though.
[21:41:34] <carpii> actually i didnt mean jquery-ui sorry
[21:41:38] <carpii> i dont remember how jquery-mobile works
[21:41:46] <TubbyTommy> I just wants the default for now
[21:41:47] <carpii> but inevitably there will be a css file it needs to load
[21:42:13] <carpii> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/
[21:42:15] <TubbyTommy> well, I've got the .css and .js for mobile
[21:42:16] <carpii> see if it matches those
[21:42:37] <TubbyTommy> Yep, both 1.4.5
