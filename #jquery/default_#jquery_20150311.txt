[00:47:46] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/c96414f5a4be6041c82f
[00:47:52] <dopie> why isn't this working?
[00:48:07] <dopie> because im no fading anything out
[00:48:10] <dopie> or assigning it a function?
[00:48:41] <Cork> $.when("nav#navigation-menu") <-- that isn't even valid
[00:48:54] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[00:49:40] <dopie> Cork, it is valid it works :)
[00:50:09] <Cork> $,when is for handling deferred objects
[00:50:18] <dopie> :)
[00:50:25] <Cork> so it makes no sense with a selector string
[00:50:51] <dopie> when i click on something i want it to change nav#navigation-menu bg to white and then run menulinks
[00:51:09] <Cork> and .when is needed cause?
[00:51:16] <dopie> i dont know
[00:51:28] <dopie> <---- 3 legged noob green horn giant banana eater
[00:51:51] <Cork> ya, so again what are you trying to do?
[00:52:00] <Cork> create a jsfiddle
[00:52:04] <dopie> ok cool
[00:56:18] <cleopatra> hello
[00:56:29] * cleopatra hello people what new?!
[00:59:37] <dopie> actually Cork how would i change css on click i want to remove .foo and add .bar to the ids
[01:00:06] <Cork> dopie: you bind a click handler and do $(this).removeClass('foo').addClass('bar');
[01:02:56] <dopie> yay!
[01:43:07] <Omar-> good morning
[01:45:53] <xec> good morning Omar- :)
[02:04:17] <dopie> Cork, YAY!!!
[02:04:47] <dopie> quick question how do i write where if either foo or bar is clicked then run the add class
[02:05:27] <Cork> dopie: event handlers is based on elements not classes
[02:05:42] <Cork> so you bind the handler on the element you want to have the handler on
[02:05:49] <Cork> and just do the class toggling you want
[02:06:25] <R13ose> Is there an example of how to make the animation take several png files and go from water to drought (if you understand what I mean) when scrolling frame by frame?
[02:07:18] <Cork> R13ose: are you talking about a slideshow or paralax or what?
[02:08:58] <Omar-> hi xec sorry just saw your msg :)
[02:09:31] <R13ose> Cork: parallax
[02:10:16] <Cork> R13ose: simplest is prob to have several layers of images and remove them one at a time as you progress
[02:10:38] <Cork> if you need to transition between images you will have to put them in separate elements though
[02:12:15] <R13ose> Cork: example?
[02:12:24] <Cork> don't have one
[02:12:41] <Cork> and it would take a considerable amount of time to generate one
[02:13:50] <R13ose> Cork: Are you saying like sprites?
[02:13:56] <Cork> no
[02:14:24] <Cork> you can't animate a background images opacity
[02:14:46] <Cork> so if you need to transition from one image to another they have to be in separate elements
[02:15:58] <R13ose> Cork:  Can you explain separate elements to me?  I just want to make sure I understand correctly.
[02:16:34] <Cork> uh like in separate divs or section or article or span or what ever element you want to use for the layering
[02:17:42] <R13ose> Cork:  Are you saying like traditional parallax, where this goes from one section to the next?  How would the animation happen?
[02:18:05] <Cork> R13ose: depends on the effect you want
[02:18:17] <Cork> but often by like i said separate elements
[02:18:41] <Cork> if it is just position you can do that in one element with multiple images
[02:19:26] <Omar-> anyone knows a good tutorial of handling two fingers touch?
[02:19:40] <Omar-> or touch events tutorial
[02:20:55] <R13ose> Cork:  Maybe I am thinking about this wrong.  Do you understand the water to drought idea?  If you do this will make the whole idea simpler for me to explain.
[02:21:25] <Cork> R13ose: yes i do
[02:21:48] <Cork> you want to switch from image to image to have the background to look like it is drying up
[02:22:01] <Cork> and that is what i've told you how to solve
[02:26:48] <R13ose> Cork:  Could this be that I am just fading in and out of images?  Like showing the water to start, and then switching that to two different images until I get to the dried up part?
[02:27:16] <Cork> R13ose: yes, but like i said, you have to do this with elements
[02:27:22] <Cork> as you can't animate background images
[02:27:44] <R13ose> Cork: so is this css not jquery?
[02:28:00] <Cork> R13ose: jquery is javascript
[02:28:12] <R13ose> I know :)
[02:28:15] <Cork> javascript makes things do things everything you see is basically css and html
[02:28:26] <Cork> and possibly canvas and svg
[02:29:00] <dopie> ok Cork 1 more :)
[02:29:05] <dopie> last one for the day
[02:29:08] <dopie> trifecta
[02:29:39] <dopie> How do i change the class of foo when the user scrolls down to a specific point down the page?
[02:30:11] <Cork> dopie: by binding the scroll event and checking the scrollTop value
[02:30:58] <R13ose> Cork:  All I am asking is if how you are telling me to do this, is this in CSS or JavaScipt code?  This is where I am stuck at the moment.
[02:31:11] <Cork> both
[02:32:12] <Cork> there are a few ways to handle the animation
[02:32:18] <Cork> but it will always include both
[02:32:46] <Cork> how much you do in each depends mainly how old the browsers you need to support are
[02:33:22] <R13ose> Cork:  Okay and there is no example just to see this in action?  If not that is okay as I am understanding this a little more.
[02:33:47] <Cork> R13ose: google for "jquery paralax" you'll find several of them
[02:33:54] <dopie> .scroll( [eventData ], handler )
[02:33:55] <Cork> it is the current hype after all
[02:33:56] <R13ose> Cork: thanks
[02:48:46] <PrimalHunter> Hi! I'm a bit lost on a cross request problem. Maybe someone would have some hints on how to solve it? Essentially I need to request form the same server on a different port using $.ajax . Is there any kind of mechanism that would enable that?
[03:00:00] <Cork> PrimalHunter: the server on the different port would have to send a cors header
[03:00:25] <Cork> and then it would only work in newer browsers (not <= ie9)
[03:01:10] <PrimalHunter> For IE it doesn't seem to be a problem. It's an internal server and in the trusted zone. IE doesn't seem to care in that case.
[03:01:46] <Cork> i meant cors headers isn't parsed by ie pre 10
[03:01:51] <neanderslob> hi all, I'm trying to set the class of a list item that I'm adding using an append statement: https://gist.github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/0bf382559d19fe4748e0
[03:01:54] <Cork> so it has no effect on it
[03:02:32] <Cork> neanderslob: from that line i suspect your doing .append in a loop
[03:02:35] <Cork> you should avoid that
[03:02:54] <Cork> create the elements in a loop and then append them in one append after the loop
[03:03:09] <Cork> else you will cause A LOT of reflow and that will kill page performance
[03:03:22] <PrimalHunter> Ah OK. Well it does work in IE right now. From what I read it ignores the port anyway if it's on the trusted list. Thanks for helping out. I'll try to change the server configuration ... if that doesn't work I guess I'll have to use some kind of wrapper script. :/
[03:03:28] <neanderslob> Cork: hmmmmmmm your powers of deduction are impressive :-)
[03:04:12] <neanderslob> Cork: alright, will give that a shot
[03:04:18] <neanderslob> Cork: thanks for saving me the headache
[03:05:05] <Cork> neanderslob: also please make a big of a bigger example with some more context
[03:05:17] <Cork> and use jsfiddle so ppl can give you a solution
[03:05:30] <Cork> *a bit of a bigger
[03:05:56] <neanderslob> Cork: will do, thanks again
[03:05:56] <PrimalHunter> neanderslob, and for you "original" question you can just do it like you did with your autoCompleteItem variable.
[03:05:58] <Cork> ?mdn cors @ PrimalHunter
[03:05:58] <b-ot> PrimalHunter: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[03:06:26] <Cork> concutting the html is normally hard to read though
[03:06:31] <Cork> there is much cleaner ways to do it
[03:08:49] <PrimalHunter> I still favor it. It makes it pretty clear that a variable is inserted in a specific location but I guess it's also a case of project size and personal taste whenever you use it or not.
[03:09:09] <Cork> it causes risk for xss
[03:09:23] <Cork> it is normally much safer to create a dom element and set the values that way
[03:09:34] <Cork> and like i said, easier to read
[03:15:54] <PrimalHunter> I'm not entirely sure that I understand you correctly. You mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/qmwbqq9j/2/
[03:18:57] <Cork> PrimalHunter: http://jsfiddle.net/qmwbqq9j/3/
[03:19:35] <Cork> PrimalHunter: jquery special cases '<elm-name>' and uses document.createElement('elm-name') for that
[03:22:58] <Grundell> hello, is it possible to check for images and add a class to the first image in a wrap? and how would i go about that ?
[03:23:23] <Cork> Grundell: what do you mean "in a wrap"?
[03:23:40] <Cork> inside a specific parent?
[03:24:02] <Grundell> i have a wrapper that holds the content called alarm within that wrapper i have about 10 - 15 images and i want to add a class to the first of thoes images
[03:24:08] <Grundell> exactly
[03:24:26] <Cork> $('.alarm img').first().addClass('special')
[03:24:46] <Grundell> that simple :)
[03:24:54] <Cork> if it is the first element inside the parent you could use :first-child
[03:24:58] <Cork> and not need the class at all
[03:25:30] <PrimalHunter> Thanks Cork! You're awesome. :)
[03:25:34] <Grundell> well ill tried to do that but it doesn't work
[03:25:53] <Cork> Grundell: first-child only matches the first element of a parent
[03:26:04] <Cork> it isn't a selector for first of type
[03:26:16] <Cork> meaning .alarm img:first-child
[03:26:16] <Grundell> 				.alarm img:first-child{width:100%!;}
[03:26:25] <Grundell> but it affects all my images
[03:26:30] <Cork> will match <div class="alarm"><img></div>
[03:26:39] <Cork> but won't match <div class="alarm"><br><img></div>
[03:27:08] <Cork> and yes it will match all of  <div class="alarm"><div><img></div><div><img></div><div><img></div></div>
[03:27:17] <Cork> as all the images are the first child
[03:27:38] <Cork> .alarm div:first-child img would fix that though
[03:28:11] <Cork> or .alarm > div:first-child img if you want to be sure it is just divs directly inside .alarm
[03:28:16] <Grundell> YEah okay because its wp so its <div class="alarm"><p><img></p> <p><img><img></div>
[03:28:33] <Cork> so replace div with p in my example
[03:30:16] <Grundell> hmm so that will only catch the first image in that case ?
[03:30:22] <Cork> yes
[03:30:33] <Cork> or rather it will only catch the image inside the first p
[03:30:37] <Grundell> okay
[03:30:38] <Grundell> sweet
[03:31:07] <Cork> git st
[03:31:09] <Cork> opps
[03:36:40] <Grundell> <;)
[03:38:06] <Grundell> hmm okay so that doesn't work for the pages that has <div class="alarm"><p>content</p><p><img></p> <p><img></p> </div>
[03:38:29] <Cork> ya, you could use p:nth-child(2)
[03:38:36] <Cork> if it is always the second p
[03:38:45] <Cork> if it isn't then you have to go back to what you did before
[03:39:00] <Grundell> no not always ...
[03:39:14] <Cork> hmm
[03:39:20] <Grundell> you mean .alarm > p:first-child img
[03:39:37] <Cork> no the add a class solution
[03:40:08] <Grundell> yeah...
[03:40:40] <Grundell> So the $('.alarm img').first().addClass('first') will catch the first image
[03:40:45] <Cork> yes
[03:40:59] <Grundell> even though its in diufferent <p> structure under ?
[03:41:22] <Cork> $('.alarm img') catches all the images inside .alarm
[03:41:30] <Cork> .first then takes the first image in that list
[03:41:37] <Cork> so the structure doesn't matter anymore
[03:41:47] <Grundell> sweet
[03:45:32] <gnu_d> Hi, how do I find which dom element has sortable object ?
[03:45:46] <gnu_d> so I can write selector for it.
[04:06:56] <Grundell> Cork: BTW thanks for taking the time to help

[04:29:12] <Omar-> i'm struggling to understand touch events :/
[04:37:06] <cuqa__> hello, im loading html code with $('elem').on("click", ".class", function(event) { }); in order to show popups
[04:37:26] <cuqa__> the problem is that I cannot trigger click functions for those loaded popups
[04:37:46] <cuqa__> using the same function like above
[04:37:47] <Cork> most likely cause "elem" is dynamic
[04:37:57] <georgeous> Omar-: Sitgis, Barcelona
[04:38:14] <Omar-> georgeous yo vivo en Marbella
[04:39:08] <georgeous> Marbella is nice
[04:39:39] <georgeous> The team is from around the world. mainly England
[04:43:28] <cuqa__> http://pastie.org/10018244
[04:45:12] <Cork> cuqa__: this one won't work $('div#input div.dimmed')
[04:45:28] <Cork> use $('div#input').on("click", ".dimmed .close"
[04:45:42] <Cork> also don't put tag names infront of ids
[04:50:59] <isthisreallife> can someone tell me why i alert does not appear when i click button? http://pastebin.com/cyvRsP0r
[04:51:52] <Cork> isthisreallife: cause the element you select for with $('#save') doesn't exist when you try to find it
[04:52:18] <isthisreallife> i see
[04:52:28] <isthisreallife> Cork, how to fix it?
[04:52:33] <Cork> isthisreallife: simplest is to delegate the event handler to a static parent
[04:52:43] <Cork> alternatively bind the event handler when you have added the element
[04:54:36] <isthisreallife> how do I bind te event handler to a element ?
[04:54:38] <BinaryKitten> hey all, i'm giving a talk on avoiding common pitfalls of JavaScript (and jQuery) at a conference soon. Anyone have anything that they see regularly that they'd like to get people informed to stop?
[04:54:51] <Cork> isthisreallife: that is what you're currently are doing
[04:54:56] <Cork> except you don
[04:55:07] <Cork> don't find the element so nothing happens
[04:55:28] <isthisreallife> so how can i find it ?
[04:55:47] <Cork> isthisreallife: if you want to do it that way you have to do it after the element has been added
[04:55:54] <Cork> you can't find what doesn't exist
[04:55:58] <isthisreallife> kk
[04:56:16] <Cork> BinaryKitten: adding elements to a page in a loop i would say is a good one
[04:57:12] <Cork> for(var i = 0; i < 100000;i++) { $('#target').append('<li>' + something + '</li>') }
[04:59:26] <cuqa__> thanks Cork
[04:59:38] <cuqa__> just built a jsfiddle, your solution works there oO https://jsfiddle.net/srwuxj7c/
[05:00:09] <Cork> cuqa__: ya, but the element exist there
[05:00:13] <Cork> it doesn't in your page
[05:00:16] <Cork> you add it later
[05:00:28] <Cork> so you have to have a selector that will actually find something
[05:00:54] <BinaryKitten> Cork cool. thanks
[05:01:08] <Cork> cuqa__: https://jsfiddle.net/srwuxj7c/2/
[05:01:16] <BinaryKitten> i had a variant on that, but yeah more the better
[05:01:17] <Cork> BinaryKitten: ^ that is quite common too
[05:01:23] <Cork> but for newer users
[05:01:59] <BinaryKitten> Cork - sorry missed the Q on that one
[05:02:13] <cuqa__> okay. thanks a lot
[05:02:14] <BinaryKitten> is it binding to elements that don't exist yet?
[05:02:16] <Cork> BinaryKitten: binding an event to an element you add later through ajax or similar
[05:02:19] <Cork> ya
[05:02:38] <BinaryKitten> yep. Will be covering delegation and repeated binding
[05:02:58] <Cork> BinaryKitten: the demographic of the one listening to you is quite important for what to include
[05:03:17] <Cork> some of these are quite well known by developers that been doing a little developing
[05:03:26] <Cork> while it is a real pitfall for new users
[05:03:28] <BinaryKitten> come across some code that cause exponential binding since the one of the events triggered the binding again
[05:03:42] <Cork> ya, that one is a good too
[05:03:51] <BinaryKitten> yep the prmary audience is wordpress
[05:04:01] <Cork> or doing animation and creating a ton of variable data/objects
[05:04:06] <BinaryKitten> since it's a wordpress conference
[05:04:13] <Cork> and cause of that getting janks cause of the gc
[05:04:39] <Cork> so what to give you depends on what audience you expect
[05:07:15] <BinaryKitten> Cork yeah got you. Going to cover from IIFE , cdn etc things that i commonly see
[05:07:25] <BinaryKitten> just there's always going to be something i've forgotten..
[05:07:49] <BinaryKitten> thus the request, so i get a larger pool of things to possibly cover
[05:08:00] <BinaryKitten> better to have too much choice than not enough
[05:44:11] <dsc_> i have a noob question: http://pastie.org/pastes/10018363/text?key=wpkey58kgabxir2ahmg
[05:44:31] <dsc_> i dont understand the plugin's usage/documentation
[05:44:34] <dsc_> it has a ||
[05:44:36] <dsc_> what does that mean
[05:45:53] <Cork> uh || {} ?!?
[05:46:00] <dsc_> yes i dont understand
[05:46:03] <Cork> that definitely doesn't look right
[05:46:11] <dsc_> yet its in the documentation
[05:46:13] <dsc_> like that
[05:46:34] <Cork> no you most likely read the syntax markers as the syntax
[05:46:49] <dsc_> Cork: not sure what that means :P
[05:46:50] <Cork> ya
[05:46:52] <Cork> textEffect('string containing effect' || {options object})
[05:47:11] <Cork> meaning textEffect('string containing effect' OR {options object})
[05:47:24] <Cork> as in you either give it a string or an object
[05:47:25] <BinaryKitten> meaning textEffeect('string') OR texteffect({options object});
[05:47:28] <dsc_> yeah I could have guessed that as well. I dont like guessing, however :-)
[05:47:29] <Cork> yes
[05:47:40] <dsc_> okay
[05:47:44] <Cork> dsc_: this is very common syntax
[05:47:51] <dsc_> Cork: in jquery land it is?
[05:48:01] <Cork> well except possibly its just one pipe
[05:48:22] <Cork> dsc_: no program commands, function definition (could give you from a long list of languages
[05:48:24] <Cork> and so on
[05:48:27] <Cork> it is very common
[05:48:38] <dsc_> okay
[05:48:42] <dsc_> maybe im just a noob
[05:49:06] <dsc_> for example
[05:49:08] <dsc_> his {options object}
[05:49:13] <dsc_> does that mean it is
[05:49:17] <dsc_> {options: {}}
[05:49:20] <Cork> no
[05:49:31] <Cork> the options isn't in that documentation
[05:49:37] <dsc_> it is
[05:49:43] <Cork> its just that you can give it the options it is to use as keys in an object
[05:50:07] <Cork> ah... heh didn't scroll down
[05:50:12] <dsc_> figured :P
[05:50:19] <dsc_> but wouldnt it more clear if he wrote
[05:50:27] <dsc_>  || {options}
[05:50:34] <dsc_> now he has 2 words within the brackets
[05:50:39] <dsc_> it makes it seem there are 2 things going on ther
[05:50:45] <Cork> uh, he just wrote it out a little more explicit
[05:50:47] <PrimalHunter> but in that case options could be anything.
[05:51:43] <dsc_> well its github, ill fork his project and rewrite documentation
[05:51:51] <Cork> { effect: 'jumble', effectSpeed: 5000, completionSpeed: 10000 } for example
[05:51:52] <dsc_> then ask for a pull
[05:52:07] <Cork> dsc_: not sure why the documentation is quite fine the way it is
[05:52:19] <dsc_> Cork: {options object}
[05:52:20] <dsc_> should be
[05:52:25] <dsc_> {options}
[05:52:27] <Cork> no
[05:52:59] <Cork> or rather either are just as correct
[05:53:06] <dsc_> right
[05:53:11] <dsc_> just one is less confusing :P
[05:53:12] <Cork> what the documentation could benifit from would be an example
[05:53:19] <Cork> i don't a gree
[05:53:20] <dsc_> yeah exactly
[05:53:22] <Cork> *agree
[05:53:24] <dsc_> an example
[05:53:26] <dsc_> would be nice
[05:53:39] <Cork> that would be better then just moving who might be confused
[05:56:22] <maximski> i won't be able to call .on() on a bootstrap modal which is being build in js (like "$(someHtml).modal()"). why?
[05:56:55] <Cork> maximski: most likely cause the element doesn't exist yet, or you bind it on the wrong element
[05:57:02] <Cork> or it serializes it so the event is lost
[05:57:08] <Cork> the list of why is long
[05:58:09] <mbrzuzy> Hi Cork :)
[06:01:55] <maximski> http://jsfiddle.net/u83hs53w/1/ can you possibly see here what it might be?
[06:02:18] <dieck> hi there! Is there a way to determine whether a specific firefox addon (here: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/local-filesystem-links/) is installed? or is that a kind of sandbox problem?
[06:03:19] <Cork> coffescript i see :)
[06:03:58] <Cork> maximski: you never really append the html to the page have you checked to it is actually inserted?
[06:04:12] <Cork> *checked so it is
[06:04:25] <maximski> the original will be coffeescript if you find that more readable
[06:04:44] <Cork> na, i just saw it from the strange returns at the end :)
[06:05:09] <Cork> btw the $(function() {}) is pointless
[06:05:14] <Cork> you can remove that line
[06:05:22] <maximski> the modal is inserted into the html yes
[06:05:56] <maximski> i know. it was just an act of despair :D
[06:06:01] <Cork> and if you do console.log($('#confirmationDialog .confirm')) just after .modal(); what do you get?
[06:08:11] <maximski> ewww
[06:08:15] <maximski> nothing :O
[06:08:31] <Cork> and console.log($('#confirmationDialog').length) ?
[06:10:01] <maximski> 0
[06:10:17] <Cork> ok so when the element is showing on the page
[06:10:25] <Cork> inspect it in the browser and make sure the id is really there
[06:10:29] <maximski> i actually need to look up that bootstrap modals function i guess
[06:10:41] <Cork> that would be my next step ya
[06:10:47] <Omar-> how to get element offset in JS? this.offsetTop?
[06:10:53] <Cork> cause if the id is there it would mean it has async code for the appending of the html
[06:10:58] <Cork> and that is what messes with you
[06:11:14] <maximski> yes it seems to be that
[06:11:30] <Cork> Omar-: the offset to the parent or the offset to the viewport or... what?
[06:12:25] <Omar-> no, the element itself in relation to screen/viewport
[06:12:38] <Cork> uh what?
[06:12:55] <Cork> that isn't really how the dom works
[06:13:20] <Omar-> this.offsetTop and .offsetLeft
[06:13:28] <arthurvr> Hey guys!
[06:13:33] <Omar-> hey arthurvr
[06:13:34] <Cork> if the offset to the parent not the screen
[06:13:42] <Omar-> wazup
[06:13:53] <Omar-> Cork this is what i'm trying to find out
[06:14:13] <Cork> Omar-: if you want the offset to the screen i would recommend using $(this).position()
[06:14:26] <Cork> as you would have to sum up all the offsets if you do it by hand
[06:14:38] <Cork> (it is what .position() does)
[06:15:18] <Omar-> .positionTop and positionLeft are native JS properties, Cork?
[06:15:25] <Cork> no
[06:15:33] <Cork> i just answered this...
[06:15:37] <Cork> less then 2 mins ago
[06:15:59] <Omar-> what i'm trying to do is, when I touch/drag an element, I want to drag it from where I touched it
[06:16:19] <Cork> so you need to calculate the absolute position
[06:16:25] <Cork> aka .position()
[06:17:18] <Omar-> Cork, if you run this in your touch device, you'll get what I mean http://jsbin.com/wequzo/
[06:17:30] <Cork> Omar-: if you want to avoid jquery you would have to walk the .parentNode up to body
[06:17:39] <Cork> and the sum up all the offsetLef/top values
[06:17:46] <Omar-> now, I'm draging the blue box based on touchmove's pageX and pageY minus heigh/width of element
[06:17:59] <Omar-> sorry, half height/width of element
[06:22:18] <maximski> Cork got it, ty for the help :)
[06:24:35] <Guest53464>  hello all,i have a problem with jquery mobile,i am dynamically generating list view in one page,when i open it for first time all the jquery styling is applied ,but when i press back button and come back to site all the styling is removed,only the dynamically generated content is retained..can you help me?
[06:29:59] <PrimalHunter> Guest53464, did you try to verify if the css is being retained while going forward/backward and did you check different browsers?
[06:33:43] <PrimalHunter> dieck, that would depend on whenever or not firefox exposes that information as extensions are a firefox thing and might be depended on the extension as well.
[06:34:58] <draconusdesigns> Okay, quick question...
[06:35:00] <draconusdesigns> http://jsfiddle.net/bcpuppot/
[06:35:25] <Guest53464> PrimalHunter: i am using a multipage template
[06:35:25] <draconusdesigns> The way I have that click function written, it of course breaks if there are multiple video blocks on the page.
[06:35:41] <Guest53464> PrimalHunter: the head section retains all the js and css
[06:36:00] <draconusdesigns> I just need to figure out how to use that to target whatever article .video is clicked, and it's associated elements.
[06:36:19] <draconusdesigns> Object scope and I havent gotten along well.
[06:39:37] <decx> you target preview so you have to traverse from there
[06:39:52] <microhaxo> Why does $.ajax use less memory than XMLHttpRequest?
[06:40:27] <Cork> microhaxo: it shouldn't as it uses xmlHttpRequest
[06:40:52] <Cork> microhaxo: you might be checking the size of the deferred object and not the xhr object
[06:40:53] <Omar-> Guest53464 please share your code or live link if you have
[06:41:41] <PrimalHunter> Guest53464, it's a bit hard without a fiddle or something alike to that. Maybe it's problem that you start to generate that list a second time and something breaks or that you share classes with jquery mobile that you shouldn't. I haven't really used it but that would be my guess.
[06:41:57] <Guest53464> http://pastebin.com/xh1njhZ0
[06:42:02] <Omar-> Guest53464 if you're using a multi-page model, this shouldnt happend. Dynamically created elements should retain their styles even if you leave the page
[06:43:13] <Guest53464> multipage model means the one with data-role ="page" right?
[06:43:13] <Omar-> Guest53464 you're using Single Page Model
[06:43:31] <Omar-> page1.hrml, page2.html, page3.html
[06:43:46] <microhaxo> Cork, hmm when i do multiple ajax requests using XMLHttpRequest i end up using about 2x as much memory in IE as i do using $.ajax. Maybe the jquery cleans up the resources faster?
[06:43:57] <Omar-> Guest53464 data-role="page" means page
[06:44:15] <guy> Is it possible to get the selector as a string? e.g. suppose I have $('.foo').parents('.bar').find('.baz'), is there a way to extract a selector that would match only the elements that are referred to using this query?
[06:44:18] <Cork> microhaxo: well you could set the xhr = null; as soon as you don't need it anymore
[06:44:29] <Cork> and it should use at most as much data
[06:44:45] <DelphiWorld> yo all
[06:44:45] <DelphiWorld> http://bashaer.info.tm/
[06:44:45] <DelphiWorld> putting a rss reader in the home but not playing
[06:44:54] <Cork> but yes leaving the variable pointing to the object will increase the memory use until it falls out of scope
[06:45:32] <Omar-> guy you mean $('.foo').parents('.bar').find('.baz')[0]?
[06:45:55] <guy> no, I mean something like .foo:eq(0) .baz:eq(1)
[06:46:13] <guy> or whatever would be the eqv. that the api matches
[06:46:32] <guy> I am guessing this too esoteric to exist.
[06:46:35] <Cork> guy: you would have to use a library that generates unique selectors
[06:46:43] <Cork> there isn't a built in solution yet
[06:46:47] <guy> I se
[06:46:49] <guy> I see
[06:47:04] <Cork> also note that those libs normally create over specific selectors
[06:47:16] <Cork> cause it is hard to know how lose you can be and still be specific
[06:48:58] <DelphiWorld> any reasonable rss reader?
[06:49:50] <BinaryKitten> jquery rss reader?
[06:50:50] <microhaxo> Cork setting it to null doesn't seem to lower the memory usage
[06:51:22] <Cork> microhaxo: when you set all references to null
[06:51:26] <Cork> AND the gc fires
[06:51:30] <Cork> the memory usage is freed
[06:57:14] <frabblerock> does anyone in here know why this is giving me an error
[06:57:16] <frabblerock> http://pastie.org/10018509
[06:57:24] <frabblerock> it's only when i use .is('visible')
[06:57:37] <randomguy> .is(':visible')
[06:57:42] <frabblerock> I get Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[06:57:42] <frabblerock> no
[06:57:44] <frabblerock> visible is a class
[06:57:52] <randomguy> .hasClass('visible')
[06:58:00] <frabblerock> still get the same error
[06:58:20] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/
[06:58:21] <randomguy> are eventItems jquery objects?
[06:58:51] <frabblerock> look at the console.
[06:59:03] <frabblerock> it works, when I remove is('visible');
[06:59:12] <frabblerock> minus the ; obv
[06:59:52] <randomguy> looks like an array
[07:00:07] <randomguy> you'll need to iterate over them to use that function
[07:00:43] <frabblerock> isn't that what .each does?
[07:01:37] <randomguy> afk a sec, group standup.  yes, but it should come before the is check and is should be inside the each
[07:03:31] <mbrzuzy> frabblerock, i don't think is() returns you an array you can iterate over
[07:04:16] <mbrzuzy> it just returns a boolean
[07:05:34] <frabblerock> i only want o yeah
[07:05:38] <frabblerock> sorry yeah
[07:07:15] <mbrzuzy> If you have a class, for instance .hidden.  You can retrieve all elements that do not have that class
[07:07:34] <mbrzuzy> $('div:not(.hidden)').each(function(){}) or something like that
[07:15:58] <frabblerock> sorry mbrzuzy but i don't see the difference here
[07:16:20] <frabblerock> the each should be iterating over divs that have a class of visible
[07:16:23] <mbrzuzy> The difference between $('div:not(.hidden)'). and $('div').is('visible')?
[07:17:11] <Cork> frabblerock: you could also do eventItems.filter('.visible')
[07:17:26] <randomguy> frabblerock: global.eventItems.filter(function(){ return $(this).hasClass('visible'); });
[07:17:41] <randomguy> frabblerock: you should be able to do the each off or that
[07:18:25] <randomguy> or Corks is probably shorter, d'oh!
[07:18:29] <randomguy> lol
[07:19:04] <randomguy> haven't finished my coffee yet.  i'll blame that
[07:19:52] <frabblerock> ah, i figured that out.
[07:19:53] <frabblerock> thanks guys.
[07:21:42] <Omar-> this is my version of pinch-to-zoom http://jsbin.com/wequzo/edit?html,output feel free to steal teh codez
[07:21:44] <Omar-> haha
[07:29:48] <DRSK> outerHeight doesn't care for box-sizing: border-box; paddings?
[07:34:13] <cjohnson> frabblerock: well what was it don't leave us in suspense
[07:38:46] <Omar-> http://i.imgur.com/q8YulKG.jpg
[07:38:48] <microhaxo> is there a jquery library / plugin that will ajax portions of a page into view and remove the old portions as the user scrolls up or down? I have a large document ~1000 pages and i want the user to be able to seamlessly scroll through it but for obvious memory limitations i cant have the whole document loaded at once.
[07:39:38] <decx> calculate how long your content is and when you reach that breakpoint while scrolling load the next
[07:39:42] <cjohnson> lol that's awesome Omar-
[07:40:14] <Omar-> lol yea
[07:40:24] <Omar-> cjohnson http://jsbin.com/retaji/
[07:40:29] <Omar-> all reddits
[07:40:34] <Omar-> using jqm
[07:41:14] <Omar-> check Hot ones
[07:42:06] <microhaxo> cjohnson do you know of a jquery library that will ajax data in as i scroll and remove the old data out of view?
[07:42:44] <Omar-> microhaxo maybe you need pagination
[07:42:49] <Omar-> with some tweaks
[07:42:53] <cjohnson> infinite scroll is the name of that... I'm sure you can find one that will destroy pages that scroll out of view
[07:43:02] <cjohnson> it sounds like he already ahs pagination
[07:43:16] <microhaxo> its a large word document, pagination wont work unfortunately.
[07:43:49] <decx> why destroy old ones?
[07:43:50] <cjohnson> ...word document?
[07:44:19] <cjohnson> you can't do what you want if your backend doesn't support paginating the data microhaxo
[07:44:22] <cjohnson> so that's step #1
[07:45:00] <microhaxo> you cant have 2gb of html loaded in the dom at once
[07:45:03] <microhaxo> just doesn't work
[07:45:11] <decx> isnt a word document by definition in pages? ^^
[07:45:14] <microhaxo> so as i scroll old data needs to be removed from dom, new data in view
[07:48:53] <cjohnson> microhaxo: you said it was a word document. now it's html?
[07:50:42] <cjohnson> regardless, like I said. If you can't get the backend to paginate the data, you can't do ajax scrolling/pagination
[07:50:48] <cjohnson> there's just no other way
[07:51:37] <microhaxo> it is a word document that has been converted into html
[07:51:57] <microhaxo> it doesn't matter what it is, lets just say its pages and pages of content into 1 dom
[07:52:54] <cjohnson> regardless, like I said. If you can't get the backend to paginate the data, you can't do ajax scrolling/pagination
[07:53:22] <cjohnson> if it's HTML, you can write a backend to paginate it.
[07:59:49] <microhaxo> I have the backend able to pull in chunks at a time
[08:00:14] <microhaxo> i just need a library to keep the visible window toss the rest and if i go up or down on the visible window, load data.
[08:00:27] <microhaxo> I could write it my self, but if it exists, i'll save time.
[08:00:52] <cjohnson> ok, "backend able to pull in chunks at a time" is called pagination
[08:01:05] <cjohnson> so yes, there are "infinite scroll" plugins that work with backend pagination
[08:01:17] <cjohnson> and as I said, I'm sure one gives you the option of destroying things as they disappear from view
[08:02:45] <cjohnson> doug16k wrote a million-row table that destroys the rows you scroll out of view to make it speedy, perhaps you could get the fiddle from him and borrow the concepts (though they're pretty straight forward)
[08:44:13] <drag0nius> how do i append everything inside one node into another?
[08:44:45] <doug16k> drag0nius, move them?
[08:46:13] <doug16k> another.append(onenode.contents())
[08:48:31] <drag0nius> it doesn't append nodes
[08:48:40] <duch_kazatel> define "append"
[08:48:46] <duch_kazatel> because that's exactly what append does.
[08:48:47] <arthurvr> You mean like this? http://jsbin.com/gigorojaci/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:49:24] <drag0nius> i'm rendering <tr>
[08:49:29] <drag0nius> and i want to move it to the end of tbody
[08:50:08] <drag0nius> the <tr> is inside <div id="container_id">
[08:51:37] <drag0nius> what
[08:51:43] <drag0nius> looks like the browser strips whole tr
[08:51:51] <drag0nius> in inspection it's just a text
[08:52:03] <drag0nius> instead of trs and tbody
[08:52:34] <doug16k> drag0nius, works for me http://jsfiddle.net/h6s8so0w/
[08:52:37] <drag0nius> this is ridicolous...
[08:53:30] <doug16k> drag0nius, move a certain row to the end of a table?
[08:53:37] <drag0nius> ok
[08:53:42] <drag0nius> i changed that <div> into <table>
[08:53:44] <drag0nius> and it works...
[08:54:29] <doug16k> if you have a selector that refers to a row, then do: someTr.parent().append(someTr)
[08:54:36] <drag0nius> it was like <div><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><tr></div> and browser stripped it to '12'
[08:55:25] <drag0nius> so $div.contents() yielded me a simple string '12' instead of that tr
[08:56:35] <doug16k> drag0nius, if you want to move one element to another place, you don't need contents()
[08:57:00] <doug16k> just put that element in a new place any way you want and it will move it
[08:57:18] <doug16k> so to move a tr to the end of the table, just append the tr to its parent
[08:59:09] <doug16k> drag0nius, the html is probably invalid if it seems to have totally changed by itself...
[08:59:31] <doug16k> drag0nius, this helps you find those problems: http://validator.w3.org/
[09:00:11] <cjohnson> as I understand it, that's *exactly* what .contents() is supposed to do -- return the text nodes
[09:00:26] <cjohnson> if you want the html... use .html()
[09:00:30] <doug16k> cjohnson, the text nodes TOO
[09:00:36] <doug16k> don't use html
[09:00:44] <doug16k> destroys all data and event handlers
[09:00:47] <cjohnson> of course
[09:00:53] <cjohnson> but if you want the html, that's how you get it
[09:01:31] <doug16k> yes
[09:01:57] <drag0nius> neither .contents() nor .html() returned nodes
[09:02:14] <doug16k> drag0nius, you arent saying what you're trying
[09:02:25] <doug16k> you're just blaming the suggestion if you dont say what didnt work
[09:02:38] <drag0nius> because i tried it already before writing here
[09:03:31] <drag0nius> basically i've create product modal, after it saves succesfully i'm getting message modal, message modal has <tr> and a piece of code to move that <tr> to the end of table
[09:04:32] <doug16k> and not what I said earlier: someTr.parent().append(someTr)
[09:05:12] <doug16k> make sure someTr.length isn't 0 in the debugger or with console.log
[09:08:06] <h3nryturk> Anyone know what is used to get an animcation like this accomplished? https://bitly.com/
[09:08:10] <doug16k> drag0nius, http://jsfiddle.net/teo6uun0/
[09:08:12] <h3nryturk> animation**
[09:08:15] <rubyonrailed> So `$('.school').each(function(i, v){ console.log($(this).find("input").val()) })` finds the first input in each "school" row.  How do I use .find to find a certain ID of an input?
[09:08:59] <duch_kazatel> rubyonrailed .find('#theId') ?
[09:09:18] <h3nryturk> why not just $(“.school input#id”)?
[09:09:19] <doug16k> rubyonrailed, why do that? do $('.school input').each(function() { console.log($(this).val(); })
[09:09:37] <doug16k> rubyonrailed, if you want to lookup by id, just lookup by id only
[09:09:40] <h3nryturk> or even better input#id
[09:09:41] <doug16k> $('#someId')
[09:09:48] <h3nryturk> ^
[09:10:16] <doug16k> rubyonrailed, duplicated ids are totally ignored by selector lookups, only the first one counts
[09:10:17] <duch_kazatel> actually, don't do input#id
[09:11:23] <rubyonrailed> So I could do something like this? `$('.school').each(function(i, v){ console.log($('#post_school_eligibility_data_children_attending input').val()) })`?
[09:11:40] <duch_kazatel> rubyonrailed sure - why would you do that though?
[09:12:35] <drag0nius> doug16k:  except <tr> isn't inside table to begin with, it's $.load()'ed, only way that works for me is $tbody.append($container.find('tr')) , tried pretty much every other possibility and everything else moves .text() instead of html
[09:12:45] <rubyonrailed> I'm trying to setup an autosave.  Each .school class has a new school with data for that certain school.  So I wan't to go through each school div and autosave the data for that specific school.
[09:13:50] <doug16k> drag0nius, if the tr is "not in a table to begin with", then the html is invalid, and it should fail
[09:13:55] <duch_kazatel> rubyonrailed $('#post_school_eligibility_data_children_attending input') doesn't appear on the page more than once, right?
[09:14:14] <rubyonrailed> duch_kazatel: Yes it shows up for each school.
[09:14:33] <rubyonrailed> duch_kazatel one form could have 10 schools listed on it.
[09:14:34] <duch_kazatel> that's not valid - you can only have an ID show up once per page.
[09:14:41] <doug16k> drag0nius, seeing the page and the page looking ok proves *nothing* - the dom could be totally wrong and changed
[09:15:23] <doug16k> drag0nius, when the html is invalid, you get exactly this: looks fine, js acts very strangely
[09:16:08] <doug16k> rubyonrailed, that's why you can scope selector lookups
[09:16:19] <duch_kazatel> don't duplicate IDs on pages.
[09:16:31] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you wind up with invalid markup ;)
[09:17:22] <doug16k> rubyonrailed, if you use class names on those that represent their purpose, then you can do a lookup like "find the *descendent* of this row element that has class foo
[09:17:25] <doug16k> "
[09:17:37] <duch_kazatel> ^ boom.
[09:18:01] <rubyonrailed> duch_kazatel:  I'm using rails `fields_for` that's how it's outputted.  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f0c51772db0719400183
[09:18:24] <duch_kazatel> Rubin that doesnt change anything
[09:18:29] <duch_kazatel> you cannot duplicate IDs on a page.
[09:18:36] <duch_kazatel> rubyonrailed i mean
[09:19:00] <doug16k> rubyonrailed, there are no ids are there? name totally isn't id
[09:19:08] <duch_kazatel> doug16k yes there are.
[09:19:19] <doug16k> oh I see
[09:19:23] <doug16k> yeah those are bad
[09:20:40] <rubyonrailed> doug16K duch_kazatel:  So I should give each one a unique id then?
[09:20:46] <doug16k> bad because if you had another one you would either have duplicate ids, or some horrible js code that pieces together strings to find elements
[09:21:02] <doug16k> rubyonrailed, ideally, avoid ids altogether
[09:21:11] <duch_kazatel> rubyonrailed yeah don't use IDs here - you want classes instead.
[09:21:19] <doug16k> particularly in cases where you know already there will be multiple
[09:21:31] <duch_kazatel> just swap out ID for class in this case and you'll be g2g
[09:22:29] <doug16k> rubyonrailed, then, given any element in a "row", you can use .closest() to go up the dom to the appropriate container, then .find by class name from there to get the one for that one
[09:22:48] <rubyonrailed> dough16k duch_kazatel: Thanks for the help, it seems like rails is assigning that id without me adding it myself.  I'll have to look into that
[09:22:57] <duch_kazatel> fix that before doing anything else.
[09:23:18] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're doing to be wrestling against the DOM - what you have is invalid, and that's not going to be fun to work against.
[09:23:24] <doug16k> rubyonrailed, is it guaranteeing that the id wont duplicate? if so, just add a class name and ignore the id
[09:24:07] <duch_kazatel> doug16k any web framework that readily duplicates IDs either has a bug or isn't being used correctly ;)
[09:24:13] <duch_kazatel> they should really fix the underlying problem.
[09:24:16] <doug16k> but yes, if the ids are duplicating, it really should be fixed
[09:24:19] <doug16k> duch_kazatel, yeah
[09:24:47] <decx> back to the handle?
[09:24:51] <decx> are you prince?
[09:25:07] <doug16k> who
[09:25:15] <decx> duch_kazatel
[09:25:41] <duch_kazatel> decx heh had a rough few days.  giving myself a break from the real name for a while.
[09:26:55] <crillegustafsson> Hi.. if I click this
[09:26:56] <crillegustafsson> $( "#navbutton" ).one( "click", function() {
[09:26:56] <crillegustafsson>         $("#page-wrapper").css( "margin-left", "-=100" );
[09:26:56] <crillegustafsson>         $(".sidebar").css( "margin-left", "-=100" );
[09:26:56] <crillegustafsson>         $("#navbutton").next("#page-wrapper").css( "margin-left", "+=100" );
[09:26:56] <crillegustafsson>     });
[09:27:02] <duch_kazatel> crillegustafsson woah
[09:27:03] <crillegustafsson> this will happend...
[09:27:05] <ZoffixWork> Hey. I'm reading JQuery Succinctly, and I'm not understanding why els[1].css() gives me function undefined error. I tried .get(1) too, as shown in the book and still get the same error. $(els[1]).css() works though. Here's the code: http://jsbin.com/dadosuribu/1/edit?js,output
[09:27:07] <duch_kazatel> don't paste into the channel homeskillet
[09:27:20] <crillegustafsson> but how do I do return of all?
[09:27:22] <duch_kazatel> ZoffixWork .eq(1).css()
[09:27:30] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ crillegustafsson
[09:27:30] <b-ot> crillegustafsson: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:28:12] <decx> you remove 100 from the #page-wrapper margin left and then add 100 to it?!
[09:28:44] <ZoffixWork> duch_kazatel, thanks. I saw .eq() somewhere in the book; I'll look for it again and read about it again :)
[09:28:57] <duch_kazatel> ZoffixWork [1] and .get(1) grab the underlying dom node which doesn't have a .css() method.  .eq(1) grabs the "jquery object" version, which does have the .css() method
[09:29:46] <doug16k> ZoffixWork, you want .eq if you still want it to be a jquery: http://jsbin.com/xanavigeni/2/edit
[09:29:58] <doug16k> if you use the raw array index, you get raw dom node
[09:30:12] <duch_kazatel> which i just explained, doug16k ;)
[09:30:30] <duch_kazatel> oh they left a while ago bummer.
[09:31:49] <doug16k> duch_kazatel,  was trying to find jsfiddle tab during that time I guess lol
[09:31:55] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:31:56] <doug16k> er, bin
[09:36:19] <crillegustafsson> how do I get menu out again ?
[09:36:19] <crillegustafsson> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/1/
[09:37:02] <ech0s7> excuseme but .val() doesn't works on input element ??
[09:37:02] <ech0s7> https://jsfiddle.net/bs5y1gse/
[09:37:31] <duch_kazatel> ech0s7 open your console.
[09:37:50] <duch_kazatel> looks like the edge link in jsfiddle doesn't work, and you'll need to escape the : in your selector.
[09:37:58] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/bs5y1gse/1/
[09:38:12] <Bhuil> someone know how i the backbone channel?
[09:38:19] <Bhuil> is*
[09:38:22] <duch_kazatel> i think it's #documentcloud
[09:38:44] <crillegustafsson> If I click menu it hide but never show on next click : http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/1/
[09:39:11] <duch_kazatel> crillegustafsson .one() executes the handler once.
[09:39:39] <crillegustafsson> ok, what can I replace it with?
[09:39:44] <duch_kazatel> also you only have code that hides things.  you probably want to use a class instead of setting css directly and then add/remove that class as needed.
[09:39:48] <duch_kazatel> you want .on()
[09:40:14] <crillegustafsson> now it disappear after 2 clicks -> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/2/
[09:40:28] <duch_kazatel> right, look at my suggestion about using classes and adding/removing them instead.
[09:41:32] <the5thNinjaTurtl> Heya, anyone know why $(req_input).animate({ backgroundColor: "#FFF" }, 1000 );  is erroring this: Error in parsing value for 'background-color'.  Declaration dropped. ?
[09:41:35] <crillegustafsson> ok. yes if I can set it to classes I can css them ?
[09:41:57] <randomguy> would he use classes, or just use.show() and .hide()?
[09:42:24] <duch_kazatel> .show() and .hide() just show and hide things.  adding/removing a class will let you specify exactly what you want to have happen.
[09:43:03] <crillegustafsson> does someone got time to show me in fiddle -> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/2/
[09:43:12] <duch_kazatel> crillegustafsson how about you try first :)
[09:43:35] <crillegustafsson> dush_kazatel this code took me 1 hour :P
[09:43:44] <randomguy> true, i guess show() and hide() aren't really useful for things like transitions
[09:44:37] <duch_kazatel> crillegustafsson i don't see a #page-wrapper in the fiddle.
[09:45:14] <crillegustafsson> this should work right? http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/3/
[09:45:24] <duch_kazatel> no.
[09:45:31] <duch_kazatel> .on() takes one function.
[09:46:19] <crillegustafsson> okey. I want same button to take 2 effects
[09:46:36] <crillegustafsson> what code should I use to make that possible ?
[09:47:09] <GreatDanton> what you want to create?
[09:47:45] <crillegustafsson> like a menu to toggle off and on
[09:47:56] <GreatDanton> you mean slide?
[09:48:00] <GreatDanton> left and right
[09:48:00] <GreatDanton> =
[09:48:01] <GreatDanton> ?
[09:48:02] <crillegustafsson> I want my content on right side to be -150px
[09:48:12] <crillegustafsson> yes =)
[09:48:46] <GreatDanton> I got the code written for my page
[09:48:55] <GreatDanton> but will have to take a look how to adapt it to your site
[09:48:57] <crillegustafsson> when I click "MENU-Button" The menu will goes left 150px; and so are the content
[09:49:28] <crillegustafsson> and when I click menubutton again it should goes back =)
[09:49:39] <crillegustafsson> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/3/
[09:50:22] <GreatDanton> it's usually nice to create simpler page
[09:50:37] <GreatDanton> like without any fancy names colors etc
[09:50:44] <GreatDanton> cause it's hard to navigate
[09:51:47] <crillegustafsson> see here
[09:51:48] <crillegustafsson> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/4/
[09:52:11] <crillegustafsson> when I click on "MENU" ICON it all goes left all the time
[09:52:22] <GreatDanton> I see
[09:52:25] <crillegustafsson> and it should go back and forward :P
[09:52:49] <GreatDanton> which part of the page is called .sidebar?
[09:53:37] <crillegustafsson> GreatDanton the navigation
[09:53:42] <GreatDanton> okay
[09:56:17] <crillegustafsson> in short terms, If button is clicked = margin-left: 50px; , and next click = margin-left 150px;
[09:57:15] <Omar-> crillegustafsson add class to target element
[09:57:58] <crillegustafsson> Omar:   $(".button").css("margin-left","150px");
[09:58:02] <crillegustafsson> like that
[09:58:22] <Omar-> for exmaple $("wrapper").addClass("animated"); $(element).on("click", function () { if ( $(wrapper).hasClass("animated") ) { close it } else { open it } });
[09:58:22] <duch_kazatel> add/remove classes and have those classes set a margin-left instead.
[09:58:34] <duch_kazatel> ^ exactly what Omar- is suggesting.
[09:58:43] <Omar-> duch_kazatel +1
[09:58:53] <crillegustafsson> ok.. will try in my code
[09:58:53] <Omar-> what he duch_kazatel is even more practical
[09:59:15] <Omar-> crillegustafsson use CSS animation, translate3d(x,y,z)
[09:59:26] <Omar-> will give nice affects
[09:59:31] <Omar-> effects*
[09:59:47] <GreatDanton> +1
[09:59:58] <GreatDanton> really good suggestion
[10:00:59] <randomguy> crille: the adding and removing classes like they said http://jsfiddle.net/rg50kurq/7/
[10:01:18] <randomguy> not fluid though
[10:02:09] <GreatDanton> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/4/
[10:02:30] <GreatDanton> sry wrong link
[10:02:32] <GreatDanton> http://jsfiddle.net/rg50kurq/12/
[10:02:55] <GreatDanton> I have same code on my page, but what omar suggested is even fancier than this
[10:04:15] <crillegustafsson> Thx.. now it looks better,
[10:04:19] <crillegustafsson> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/13/
[10:04:20] <randomguy> slider: http://jsfiddle.net/rg50kurq/14/  heh
[10:04:49] <dopie> hey Cork you still alive?
[10:05:00] <crillegustafsson> randomguy: yes like I have it now here
[10:05:21] <crillegustafsson> randomguy http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/15/
[10:05:37] <crillegustafsson> but the content on right side must follow =)
[10:06:43] <crillegustafsson> #page-wrapper need to be margin-left: 0px
[10:06:49] <crillegustafsson> also
[10:15:03] <the5thNinjaTurtl> Can I ask again? I'm really stuck on this one:
[10:15:04] <the5thNinjaTurtl> anyone know why $(req_input).animate({ backgroundColor: "#FFF" }, 1000 );  is erroring this: Error in parsing value for 'background-color'.  Declaration dropped. ?
[10:15:05] <the5thNinjaTurtl> thanks
[10:15:59] <decx> you need jquery ui to animate nonnumerical properties
[10:16:03] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6492465/923919
[10:16:10] <duch_kazatel> there's also a plugin for it.
[10:16:14] <Omar-> crillegustafsson GreatDanton http://jsfiddle.net/zqL4bdkn/
[10:16:36] <the5thNinjaTurtl> decx, duch_kazatel Thanks!
[10:17:20] <crillegustafsson> Omar- http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/15/
[10:17:34] <crillegustafsson> I also want the content on right-side to slide to left
[10:17:53] <crillegustafsson> thats the problem im on right now :P
[10:20:45] <Omar-> crillegustafsson simply, do the same
[10:22:14] <Omar-> the5thNinjaTurtl use CSS animation instead of jq/js and plugins
[10:22:33] <crillegustafsson> Omar- like this --> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/rg50kurq/21/
[10:28:09] <whallz>  visibilitychange event is not triggered when switching program/window with ALT+TAB or clicking in taskbar: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28993157/visibilitychange-event-is-not-triggered-when-switching-program-window-with-altt
[10:29:43] <duch_kazatel> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14399
[10:29:51] <duch_kazatel> that might be related.
[10:40:38] <whallz> duch_kazatel: so i guess its related to the vendor prefixes
[10:40:39] <whallz> thanks
[10:42:18] <MasterKwoth> hello, if i want to do $("#myid").css and then also want to do #("myid").somethingelse and like that multiple times, is it possible to somehow write it in a shorter way
[10:42:32] <duch_kazatel> oftentimes, yes.
[10:42:44] <MasterKwoth> like $("#myid") .css (lalal) .somethingelse("lalala") .style("lalala")
[10:43:09] <duch_kazatel> $('#myId').css('left', '1000000px').somethingElse();
[10:43:24] <MasterKwoth> thanks, ill test it
[10:43:49] <duch_kazatel> lots of jquery methods return a jquery object, so you can chain methods.
[11:03:41] <whallz> duch_kazatel: vendor prefixes events have the same behaviour
[11:03:45] <whallz> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28993157/visibilitychange-event-is-not-triggered-when-switching-program-window-with-altt
[11:04:54] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[11:05:20] <tasaif> would that be a webkit question or a chrome question?
[11:05:45] <duch_kazatel> chrome in his particular case, but i wonder if that's the only browser with the bug.
[11:05:52] <duch_kazatel> whallz have you tried other browsers?
[11:06:55] <whallz> duch_kazatel: not yet, the thing is if i cannot make it work in chrome in windows which is the most important for me i dont care about other browsers
[11:07:27] <duch_kazatel> whallz right, but that helps us understand if there's a browser bug, or another issue at play.
[11:07:50] <whallz> duch_kazatel: you're right, let me check in firefox
[11:13:54] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/opnyLcyf/
[11:14:02] <tasaif> I tried it on firefox and chrome in macos
[11:14:06] <tasaif> 'they behave the same
[11:15:00] <duch_kazatel> windows FF doesn't fire if you alt+tab away
[11:15:13] <whallz> duch_kazatel: tried firefox and explorer and its the same
[11:15:15] <duch_kazatel> same with windows chrome.
[11:15:29] <tasaif> Maybe that's not part of the spec
[11:15:30] <whallz> yup
[11:15:43] <whallz> maybe it's not in the API scope ?
[11:15:49] <duch_kazatel> tasaif then there's a massive inconsistency between windows and mac, even though there shouldn't be imo.
[11:15:54] <duch_kazatel> i thought you'd read the spec.
[11:16:03] <whallz> i think its weird because the minimize button does trigger
[11:16:06] <whallz> i did
[11:16:18] <whallz> but it does not mention ALT+TAB or taskbar switching between programs
[11:17:27] <duch_kazatel> right, because that would be OS-specific....
[11:18:09] <duch_kazatel> i'm about to leave for lunch, but I'd check to see how the spec defines the concept of "visible"
[11:20:14] <duch_kazatel> there might also be limitations at an OS level about how the browser can be notified of visibility changes at that level
[11:21:48] <whallz> yes, i guess that's where this issue is coming from
[11:22:10] <whallz> i emailed public-web-perf@w3.org as stated in the api's spec sheet
[11:22:12] <whallz> anyway
[11:22:15] <whallz> many thanks
[11:23:33] <Omar-> whallz all I could do is +1 your question
[11:24:05] <whallz> thanks, that helps!
[11:24:21] <Omar-> np :)
[11:24:24] * Omar- hates SO
[11:24:50] <tasaif> whallz: where are you seeing the alt tab part of the spec sheet?
[11:24:59] <duch_kazatel> he isn't.
[11:25:12] <duch_kazatel> because that would be OS specific, which the spec doesn't cover.
[11:25:47] <Omar-> whallz btw, alt+tab doesn't minimize window
[11:25:58] <tasaif> that's not OS specific
[11:26:19] <tasaif> all desktop environments have an alt-tab equivalent
[11:30:16] <whallz> tasaif: i can't find that in the spec
[11:30:58] <whallz> Omar-: i know, but if the target program or window to which you are switching is maximized or fullscreen, the browsertab window is definitely not visible
[11:31:29] <whallz> but as duch_kazatel mentioned, that probably is at os level, i mean between the os and the browser
[11:31:46] <whallz> so i'm not sure if the api is even considering it
[11:31:55] <Omar-> whallz maybe..
[11:32:09] <Omar-> but if so, this should be mentioned in docs
[11:32:22] <whallz> yup, it should
[11:32:46] <whallz> i'll se if the focus event is of any good
[11:33:29] <tasaif> whallz
[11:33:32] <tasaif> they are
[11:33:42] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/opnyLcyf/1/
[11:34:09] <tasaif> visibilitychange catches the tab switching, focus and blur catch the alt tabbing
[11:34:25] <tasaif> with their powers combined you should be able to captain planet
[11:36:50] <Omar-> nice demo tasaif
[11:37:11] <tasaif> thx
[11:37:36] <whallz> tasaif: good one, still alt+tab doesnt trigger the focus/blur events for me in chrome
[11:38:02] <tasaif> try clicking on the result window before alt tabbing
[11:38:25] <whallz> nope
[11:39:04] <whallz> same behaviour as visibilitychange
[11:39:57] <Omar-> only blur focus fired on alt tabbing
[11:40:10] <Omar-> but that's after clicking result body
[11:40:25] <tasaif> right
[11:40:39] <tasaif> but combining the two should do what's needed
[11:43:59] <tasaif> something like this
[11:44:00] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/opnyLcyf/2/
[11:46:58] <whallz> tasaif: that did the trick, many thanks!!!
[11:47:31] <tasaif> np
[11:47:42] <tasaif> sir do you mind before you go to take a customer satisfaction survey?
[11:50:52] <Omar-> tasaif: "No thanks."

[12:01:49] <kecer> snover: I actually tried mp3 and it worked.
[12:02:49] <snover> kecer: only if the OS has built in support for decoding mp3.
[12:03:44] <kecer> tasaif: Sorry your browser does not support speech synthesis. :<<< many cries
[12:04:39] <kecer> snover: it is possible. I always include .ogg alongside mp3 on the web, but this api offers only mp3, that is why I am doing what I am doing :D

[12:18:20] <notchris> I have a calendar that lets you go back and forth between months
[12:18:35] <notchris> Right now I have it so that you can only cycle through the previous and next month
[12:34:49] <hadifarnoud> I have a button as <input type="submit" value="" class="optin-submit button" /> and I want to add something like mixpanel.track_links("#nav", "Clicked Nav Link"); to it. the problem is that button does not have an ID.
[12:34:51] <hadifarnoud> this is the mixpanel doc. I do not want to modify my theme and add ID to the input. what should I do?
[12:38:51] <whallz> tasaif: sure, i'll take the survey (sorry for the delay hah)
[12:40:09] <whallz> tasaif: there an issue with your fiddle though, the event is fired twice :)
[12:41:49] <notchris> Can I perform an action upon an item being clicked x times
[12:42:02] <whallz> tasaif: i fixed it using a flag, thanks!
[12:42:34] <whallz> notchris: sure, you need to listen to the click event and count the amount of clicks, then do whatever your action is
[12:42:49] <notchris> whallz: Thanks

[12:43:46] <notchris> But I want the same functionallity except upon two clicks
[12:44:50] <whallz> notchris, i'm not sure i follow you, shouldn't the amount of clicks be determined on the amount of items your have to show/hide with your previous/next buttons ?

[12:48:05] <whallz> notchris do you have this running somewhere accesible? or can you make a jsfiddle?

[12:49:20] <notchris> whallz: http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/wp-content/themes/csc-bootstrap/js/calendar.js
[12:49:41] <whallz> ok so you need to append the prev button in all months but the first, and append the next button in all months but the last
[12:59:28] <rogi1> if I have 2 jquery objects, how can I $(obj1, obj2).hide() ?
[13:00:24] <shoky> obj1.add(obj2).hide()
[13:02:21] <rogi1> looks like [].each is the only other way?
[13:03:05] <rogi1> would be nice to have a wrapper around add(), so an array of $ objects would just work
[13:04:36] <mrcloud> hi guys. I have a problem with this code http://pastebin.com/H3mVfB8j When I execute it that ajax request returns a json but also an error. A bad request from my local ip. Why is this happening?
[13:05:09] <rogi1> oh so this works $([ $obj1[0], $obj2[0] ]).hide()
[13:05:25] <rogi1> ugly though
[13:16:32] <Zlepper> If an element starts out hidden, is it not possible for JQuery to attach an eventhandler to the element?
[13:16:42] <duch_kazatel> hidden or not in the document?
[13:16:49] <Zlepper> Hidden
[13:16:54] <duch_kazatel> that works.
[13:17:03] <duch_kazatel> as long as it's in the document, you're fine.
[13:17:40] <Zlepper> Strange, doesn't seem to be working.
[13:17:48] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Zlepper
[13:17:48] <b-ot> Zlepper: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[13:19:26] <whallz> duch_kazatel sorry, is there a right place for that?

[13:22:33] <crillegustafsson> hi.. how to move 2 divs with margin-left with clicking
[13:22:41] <duch_kazatel> what part shouldn't work, Zlepper?
[13:22:44] <Zlepper> It should log "submitted" to the console when the form is submitted
[13:22:49] <Zlepper> but it doesn't
[13:23:08] <Zlepper> Might be related also, I can't set the value of the fields from my script either
[13:23:33] <duch_kazatel> Zlepper ah iirc bootstrap clones the elements in question, so you're not bound to the correct element.
[13:23:37] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation instead.
[13:25:25] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vs2cw0hb/1/ something like this.
[13:28:58] <hadifarnoud> I use   mixpanel.track_links("input.optin-submit.button[type='submit']", "Subscribed");   for tracking an event with mixpanel. it works but if I fill the "email address" in http://hamfekr.net , then when click on "<" it goes to /undefined. you need to add mixpanel.track_links("input.optin-submit.button[type='submit']", "Subscribed"); in console, didn't add it to the site yet

[13:56:41] <duch_kazatel> crillegustafsson go read documentation and learn about CSS transitions.

[13:59:42] <DelphiWorld> hi guys
[13:59:54] <DelphiWorld> is it pocible to style the content of a div?
[14:00:02] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[14:00:10] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do with it?
[14:00:47] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: just the div have a <p> and want to make it red. my question could be stupid, i'm developing my personal page even i'm blind
[14:01:00] <duch_kazatel> div p { color: red; }
[14:01:18] <duch_kazatel> lots of documentation and reading out there on the subject.
[14:01:19] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: better if i could avoid inline css
[14:01:35] <duch_kazatel> go learn about CSS.
[14:02:03] <duch_kazatel> but what i just gave you wouldn't be inlin.
[14:02:06] <duch_kazatel> *inline
[14:02:36] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: i'm reading, bbut my blindness lead me to ask due to some missunderstanding:P
[14:02:40] <crillegustafsson> yes thx
[14:02:56] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld you should check out #css
[14:04:58] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel:
[14:05:02] <DelphiWorld> #notice{
[14:05:02] <DelphiWorld> color: red;
[14:05:02] <DelphiWorld> }
[14:05:08] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: acceptable?
[14:05:12] <duch_kazatel> please don't paste multiple lines into the channel.
[14:05:17] <duch_kazatel> but yes, that will function.
[14:05:30] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: it was 3 line ;)
[14:05:34] <duch_kazatel> don't care.
[14:05:35] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: but, thank :P
[14:05:38] <duch_kazatel> it spams the channel.
[14:08:57] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: now another question, when writing a notice, i did it in red. any recomandation for a background?
[14:09:47] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld yeah - check out #css.  they'd have some great suggestions for you :)
[14:10:21] * DelphiWorld listening to duch_kazatel
[14:13:14] <grodtt> hi
[14:13:43] <grodtt> is there a way to select anything but? for example I click a button and a div pops up, and I want that div to close when you click on anything but the div?
[14:15:38] <t4nk255> Hi, does anyone know a lightweight and easy jquery form validation function which I can use to validate a form ONBLUR before it is being actually send?
[14:17:09] <DelphiWorld> people in #css are drink.
[14:19:54] <duch_kazatel> it's kind of hard to know what you need, DelphiWorld.
[14:20:26] <t4nk255> Hi, does anyone know a lightweight and easy jquery form validation function which I can use to validate a form ONBLUR before it is being actually send?
[14:20:30] <duch_kazatel> grodtt did you make your own modalk library?
[14:20:31] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: my question is very basic. 1. i wrote a notice, should i let it in red or no. 2. should i need a bgcolor for it?
[14:20:39] <grodtt> duch_kazatel, nope
[14:20:52] <duch_kazatel> grodtt then it should be able to take care of that for you.
[14:20:57] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld maybe a design channel?
[14:21:05] <grodtt> duch_kazatel, what do you mean my friend
[14:21:20] <duch_kazatel> grodtt what modal library are you using?
[14:21:32] <grodtt> no modal, just a div shows
[14:22:31] <duch_kazatel> grodtt i thought you had a modal.  check out binding a listener to $(document) and check to see if the element is $(this) or a parent of $(this)
[14:24:04] <duch_kazatel> t4nk255 jquery validate is a pretty fully-featured validation library.
[14:29:05] <Omar-> good evening
[14:29:50] <duch_kazatel> hey Omar-
[14:29:57] <Omar-> hey duch_kazatel
[14:30:00] <Omar-> wazuuuuuuup
[14:30:03] <duch_kazatel> hah
[14:31:23] <Omar-> haha
[14:31:49] <Omar-> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJmqCKtJnxM
[14:33:03] <Omar-> duch_kazatel are you into touch events?
[14:33:25] <duch_kazatel> i've played with them some but not much.  we have an entire mobile team dedicated to handling all that.
[14:33:48] <Omar-> nice, can anyone of them spare some time for me? :D
[14:34:03] <duch_kazatel> heh, nah man.  sorry ;)\
[14:34:09] <duch_kazatel> just ask your questions.
[14:34:47] <Omar-> well, dargging in the blue box in this http://jsbin.com/wequzo/ is totally wrong
[14:35:11] <Omar-> I'm trying to drag it from where it's touched and held
[14:35:16] <Omar-> like dragging
[14:35:51] <duch_kazatel> it looks like you have some bad CSS floating around.
[14:36:16] <Omar-> duch_kazatel nah, there's no css involved whatsoever
[14:36:25] <Omar-> i'll show you
[14:36:26] <Omar-> sec
[14:38:32] <duch_kazatel> this.style.left = touch[0].pageX - 100 + "px"; this is why.
[14:38:36] <Omar-> duch_kazatel http://jsbin.com/wequzo/ the same but updated
[14:38:55] <Omar-> duch_kazatel i change pageX with clientX
[14:38:58] <duch_kazatel> "left" is in relation to the parent container.
[14:39:06] <duch_kazatel> not the page.
[14:39:10] <Omar-> 100 is half widht/height of the box
[14:39:28] <Omar-> duch_kazatel I've removed the wrapper
[14:39:43] <Omar-> it's now a direct child of body
[14:39:50] <duch_kazatel> and now it works.
[14:40:18] <Omar-> if you hold it from any corner and drag it, it centers the box and then moves it
[14:40:30] <duch_kazatel> right, because that's what your math tells it to do.
[14:40:53] <Omar-> I tried to "steal" some codez from jq-ui draggable widget but it's hard to understand their codez
[14:41:17] <Omar-> exactly, this is only an example
[14:41:31] <Omar-> I dont know what other factors I should take into consideration
[14:41:54] <Omar-> if you have time, in your mobile, check any image on imgur.com
[14:42:11] <duch_kazatel> why not use the chrome mobile emulator?
[14:42:37] <Omar-> you can zoom in/out and scroll the image while the whole page remain as is
[14:42:44] <Omar-> i'm using chrome devtools
[14:42:46] <tasaif> what's going on?
[14:43:01] <Omar-> also iphone for multi-touch testing
[14:43:10] <Omar-> tasaif scroll up haha
[14:43:54] <Omar-> imgur uses this code to handle touch events https://gist.github.com/Palestinian/5ab1872f8898efd251be
[14:44:04] <Omar-> minified and rather complicated
[14:44:25] <tasaif> why don't you use jquery's draggable?
[14:45:01] <Omar-> tasaif It should be simple without a plugin I assume
[14:45:39] <Omar-> I want to achieve two things, dragability and zoomability
[14:45:43] <Omar-> just like imgur
[14:46:46] <tasaif> Omar-: something like this http://timmywil.github.io/jquery.panzoom/
[14:46:46] <tasaif> ?
[14:48:48] <Omar-> tasaif this looks nice
[14:48:55] <Omar-> i'll check teh codez
[14:48:58] <Omar-> thanks
[14:48:59] <Omar-> :)
[14:49:01] <tasaif> np
[14:49:19] <Omar-> i also want to zoom in/out using two fingers
[14:49:38] <Omar-> let's finish dragging problem first
[14:54:38] <tasaif> that library said that it supports pinching
[14:54:53] <Omar-> https://github.com/timmywil/jquery.panzoom/blob/master/src/panzoom.js#L1004
[14:55:08] <Omar-> helpful code starts there
[15:06:34] * Omar- yawns
[15:10:13] <Omar-> tasaif duch_kazatel good night!
[15:10:16] <Omar-> talk to you tomorrow
[15:10:22] <tasaif> cya
[15:10:48] <Omar-> :)
[15:23:24] <wjwj> is there a way to make something animate *if* it moves?
[15:23:41] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:24:24] <wjwj> for example tag A animates out of visiblity hidden, pushhing all elements aside in a very ridig manner
[15:24:52] <wjwj> i was wondering if theres a way to tell a tag via jQ to animate it is ever moves
[15:25:06] <duch_kazatel> nope - you need to animate them each separately.
[15:25:26] <wjwj> ok so on event, id animate everything i wanted individually
[15:25:43] <duch_kazatel> yeah pretty much.
[15:25:59] <wjwj> ok well is there a way to have an element just animate to a position 50 pixels below it?
[15:26:14] <wjwj> without defining a new element or nytihng cmplex
[15:26:41] <duch_kazatel> not sure how you're defining "50px below it", but yeah that's pretty simple.
[15:26:48] <duch_kazatel> just animate the botton property on it.
[15:27:00] <wjwj> hmm
[15:27:14] <wjwj> but then it might push other things out of the way leading to an infeasible chain reaction, right
[15:27:23] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:27:31] <duch_kazatel> "infeasiblke chain reaction"?
[15:27:36] <wjwj> mhm
[15:27:51] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what you mean by that.
[15:28:09] <wjwj> like if anything id want to animate the div below it to ignore boundaries, margins, paddings, etc
[15:28:18] <wjwj> well i just mean
[15:28:33] <duch_kazatel> i'd need to see what you're talking about because I have no clude wtf you're envisioning now.
[15:28:38] <wjwj> i dont wanna deal with side effects of animating something to move 50px down
[15:28:49] <tasaif> you mean you want the position to be absolute
[15:29:00] <wjwj> because of the way margins/paddings/etc are defined on that element w.r.t. the other elements srrounding it
[15:29:04] <wjwj> well yeah
[15:29:13] <wjwj> but if i do that i have to add more porertties
[15:29:18] <duch_kazatel> yeah i feel like you're convoluting things.
[15:29:28] <wjwj> because then my css on it like margin0auto gets messe up
[15:29:50] <wjwj> i just want a div to move down a bit, then move back up when the leement that pushed it vanishes back into hidden mode
[15:30:10] <wjwj> right now the div moves automatically to satisfy the css math
[15:30:15] <wjwj> and its jerky motion
[15:30:39] <tasaif> > I just want it to be positioned relative to the other elements but momentarily have absolute positioning
[15:31:22] <wjwj> how to do that?
[15:31:59] <tasaif> I'm not sure
[15:32:02] <tasaif> I've never had to do that
[15:32:13] <wjwj> well it rises from a simple desire
[15:32:25] <wjwj> a physically intituive object motion
[15:32:30] <duch_kazatel> how about you show us what you're working with
[15:32:37] <wjwj> I'll explain it
[15:32:40] <wjwj> it layman terms
[15:32:42] <duch_kazatel> show us.
[15:32:45] <duch_kazatel> don't explain.
[15:32:59] <wjwj> its on local development
[15:33:12] <wjwj> but im sure youll understand what i mean
[15:34:04] <wjwj> i have two divs of rectnagular dimensions. the one on top is hidden. when i toggle the top to be visible, it pushes the bottom one out of the way. im sure everyone has run into this behavior
[15:34:08] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle yo
[15:34:14] <wjwj> the bottom one moves away jerkily
[15:34:41] <wjwj> as you expect
[15:34:55] <wjwj> wait a second
[15:34:58] <wjwj> I know the solution
[15:35:05] <wjwj> i will change duplay none to display hidden
[15:35:08] <wjwj> thus
[15:35:14] <wjwj> the space wil not be changed
[15:35:30] <wjwj> that's a terrible solution cause then ill have a bunch of whitespace everywhere
[15:35:47] <wjwj> its better to have things flow like physical objects
[15:35:54] <tasaif> something like this?
[15:35:54] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/agdzq7L9/
[15:37:18] <wjwj> is there a quick jquery thing that moves something down like that
[15:37:41] <duch_kazatel> you want to use CSS when possible.
[15:40:02] <wjwj> so would i be able to transiaiton an element into visiblity?
[15:40:04] <wjwj> using only css
[15:40:44] <tasaif> you mean opacity?
[15:41:28] <wjwj> ah well
[15:41:32] <wjwj> id like it to take up no space
[15:41:35] <wjwj> its an error message
[15:41:44] <wjwj> then pop into existence
[15:41:53] <tasaif> you could animate the height or the width
[15:42:24] <wjwj> atm im just using jquery toggle 200ms
[15:42:48] <wjwj> it gets the job done for now
[15:46:48] <tasaif> wjwj: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/ku77oqxg/
[15:47:08] <tasaif> not the best solution because it doesn't scale based on content but that's what you get for free (shrug)
[15:47:39] <wjwj> what do you mean it doesnt scale based on content?
[15:48:29] <tasaif> it's set to 20px when activated
[15:48:36] <tasaif> it doesn't change height based on it's contents
[15:48:53] <wjwj> oh ok  ise what you mean
[15:52:40] <MrStar> D: it's so weird.. I have been trying to create an input-element (type="checkbox") and append a label to it (on same hierarchical level) and then take these two and make a JQuery UI button from it to get a checkbox.. but it just refuses to work...
[15:52:59] <duch_kazatel> you can't append a label to an input.
[15:53:16] <duch_kazatel> you can append an input to a label, though
[15:53:45] <AoiC> well I know input is self-contracting, but I thought append would append on the same level - and not as a child
[15:54:03] <duch_kazatel> ... then it wouldn't be called "append"
[15:54:22] <AoiC> hm and how would it be called?
[15:54:36] <duch_kazatel> you want to insert something after an element i take it?
[15:54:45] <AoiC> yeah, but on the same level
[15:54:52] <duch_kazatel> right.
[15:54:56] <duch_kazatel> so after the element.
[15:55:00] <AoiC> like if I created a div and appended 2 elements to it
[15:55:55] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/insertafter/
[15:55:56] <duch_kazatel> right,
[15:56:17] <AoiC> ahhh .. I searched "DOM Insertion, Inside" it seems..
[15:56:24] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:56:31] <AoiC> forgot there was more to it .. duh.. thank you!
[15:57:29] <AoiC> I wish jsfiddle would work with jquery ui, too .. hm..
[15:57:35] <duch_kazatel> it does.
[15:57:53] <AoiC> I could probably throw a <script>-element into it, but then XSS might not like it or something
[15:57:56] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gh8ch7ds/
[15:57:59] <AoiC> hm I cannot select ...
[15:58:15] <duch_kazatel> there's also an "external resources" section for linking eternal scripts.
[15:58:39] <AoiC> ahhh .. thanks .. what I see is certain libraries have certain additional libraries..
[15:59:04] <AoiC> I was testing with jquery 1.11.0 - and they do not have a jquery ui for it in the list (though external resources would indeed work it seems)
[15:59:06] <AoiC> thanks!
[16:07:54] <jeffmjack> is there something wrong with this?           $('tr.student').last.find('td.name-col').text(name);
[16:08:01] <duch_kazatel> .last()
[16:08:08] <duch_kazatel> it's a method.
[16:08:22] <jeffmjack> that takes a callback?
[16:08:29] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:08:33] <duch_kazatel> just needs the ()
[16:08:40] <duch_kazatel> .last().find()
[16:08:49] <jeffmjack> ah got it.  Thanks!
[16:36:04] <jeffmjack> any ideas on the weird click handler behavior here?
[16:36:04] <jeffmjack> http://jsfiddle.net/2Lhsjzzv/1/
[16:36:43] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:36:59] <jeffmjack> duch_kazatel: what?
[16:37:10] <duch_kazatel> your code doesn't make any sense.
[16:37:16] <jeffmjack> why not
[16:37:30] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't do anything.
[16:37:34] <jeffmjack> the alert thing was just to test for a reaction
[16:37:36] <duch_kazatel> what are you expecting?
[16:37:45] <jeffmjack> to get an alert when I click on a checkbox
[16:38:40] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2Lhsjzzv/2/
[16:38:44] <duch_kazatel> then do this.
[16:38:50] <duch_kazatel> no reason to use .each().
[16:39:22] <tasaif> index is still wrong
[16:39:26] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[16:39:31] <duch_kazatel> but that's the next issue ;)
[16:39:40] <tasaif> :p
[16:39:43] <duch_kazatel> he wants the index of a parent element instead.
[16:39:46] <jeffmjack> right that's about closures right?
[16:39:51] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:39:58] <jeffmjack> crap
[16:39:59] <duch_kazatel> that's about you getting the index of the wrong element.
[16:39:59] <scribblemaniac> just for future reference your issue was with using this and not $(this)
[16:40:03] <jeffmjack> I want the index of the checkbox in that series
[16:40:46] <duch_kazatel> yeah your first issue was that you were using 'this' instead of '$(this)'.  now you need to rethink the index.
[16:40:54] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/2Lhsjzzv/5/
[16:40:59] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is the checkbox.  .index() is relative to the current level.
[16:41:05] <duch_kazatel> the checkbox is nested under other elements.
[16:41:24] <duch_kazatel> so you want the index of the closest parent td element.
[16:41:25] <jeffmjack> so, $(this).parent().index()?
[16:41:35] <duch_kazatel> or $(this).closest('td').index()
[16:42:09] <tasaif> or
[16:42:11] <tasaif> and hear me out
[16:42:33] <duch_kazatel> also, you should bind a "change" listener for inputs.
[16:42:35] <duch_kazatel> not a click.
[16:42:48] <tasaif> you get the index of the closest td, then match it up to the same position header column and take that value
[16:43:08] <duch_kazatel> then you're convoluting it.
[16:43:18] <duch_kazatel> you really need to find a different way to store your data at that point ;)
[16:43:27] <tasaif> then using the google maps api
[16:44:03] <tasaif> you plot the data in a map with the meta data
[16:44:09] <tasaif> so you can scrape it later
[16:45:09] <jeffmjack> Hm, I'm not sure I understand the part about the index
[16:45:17] <tasaif> backend, opengl, ram swapping, internet
[16:45:35] <duch_kazatel> jeffmjack so think about it this way.
[16:45:46] <jeffmjack> there will be multiple rows of students; so I'll need both the student row (which I think is what you're speaking to)
[16:45:54] <jeffmjack> and the index of the checkbox itself
[16:45:59] <duch_kazatel> .index() gets the elements index, right?  but only in relation to things at that level.
[16:46:31] <duch_kazatel> the checkboxes are all nested under separate <td> elements, so when you get the index of the checkbox, it doesn't have any "siblings".
[16:46:42] <jeffmjack> right
[16:46:53] <duch_kazatel> so you want the index of the parent td element.
[16:47:02] <jeffmjack> you have to find it's index as a member of an array of elements nested under its parents
[16:47:04] <jeffmjack> er. parent
[16:47:11] <duch_kazatel> sort of, yeah.

[16:53:10] <cordovafan8> Hello all. I am looking for a way to implement a flipswitch in jquery mobile 1.3.1 . So far I've been following the 'slider' widget documentation, but it doesn't seem to do be able to call the slider methods (e.g. slider("refresh") fails with no such method 'refresh' for slider widget instance)
[16:57:05] <itinajero> Hi there!!!
[16:57:37] <itinajero> A few days ago I was using the jquerymobile framework!!
[16:58:39] <tasaif> http://cruise.control.for.cool.jpg.to/
[16:59:02] <itinajero> I needed a responsive jquery Mobile, so, and I developed on my own with side server pagination!!
[16:59:40] <itinajero> I want to contribute with my jquery mobile table with pagination to the community
[17:00:08] <duch_kazatel> Publish it to github i guess?
[17:00:54] <tasaif> itinajero: you're looking for #jquery-dev
[17:01:42] <bongjovi> I loaded a div with a data attribute via ajax, is there any way to access it?
[17:01:45] <itinajero> Yes, I'd like to contribute with this awesome feature to jqueryMobile table component
[17:01:49] <bongjovi> neither .data or .attr work
[17:01:58] <duch_kazatel> itinajero then go to #jquery-dev and talk to them.
[17:02:12] <itinajero> Ok, thanks duch_kazatel
[17:02:18] <duch_kazatel> bongjovi bullshit ;)
[17:02:20] <itinajero> I'll go there.
[17:02:33] <youness1307> https://www.refheap.com/98339 any Idea about this code and why it doesn't work. I already have a  return 401 Unauthorized
[17:02:37] <bongjovi> I just get undefined when I log it duch_kazatel
[17:02:50] <duch_kazatel> log what?
[17:03:28] <cordovafan8> I am very stumped on how to make this flip switch.
[17:03:37] <bongjovi> the $(this).data("var");
[17:03:44] <bongjovi> or $(this).attr("data-var");
[17:03:51] <duch_kazatel> bongjovi then it doesn't have that data attribute.
[17:04:08] <bruce_lee> hello @all
[17:04:19] <bongjovi> Hahah
[17:04:25] <duch_kazatel> i'm not kidding.
[17:04:26] <bongjovi> You're actually right
[17:04:29] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:04:30] <bongjovi> LOL, thanks.
[17:04:33] <bruce_lee> I have a: $.getScript( "js/jquery.imageScroll.js" )
[17:04:55] <bruce_lee> is there a way to disable it completly "onresize"?
[17:05:05] <duch_kazatel> bruce_lee disable what?
[17:05:33] <bruce_lee> duch_kazatel: all the js that's in that script
[17:05:56] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to read the code's documentation to see how to turn it off.
[17:06:30] <duch_kazatel> you should also check what the window size is on load to see if you should even run it.
[17:06:39] <youness1307> https://www.refheap.com/98339 any Idea about this code and why it doesn't work. I already have a  return 401 Unauthorized
[17:07:10] <bruce_lee> duch_kazatel: ok, i hoped that there would be something like the oposite to "getScript"...
[17:07:22] <duch_kazatel> bruce_lee nope.  once the code's loaded, that's kind of it.
[17:07:32] <duch_kazatel> like, you can't "un-execute" code.
[17:11:26] <alfredo> (youness1307) https://www.refheap.com/98339 any Idea about this code and why it doesn't work. I already have a  return 401 Unauthorized
[17:12:48] <alfredo> What kind of authentification do you need to access to this url youness1307
[17:13:19] <youness1307> basic authentification
[17:13:38] <mooncup> "Authorization": "Basic " + btoa("tnhtn230" + ":" + "reFUcHa8")
[17:13:40] <mooncup> should be
[17:13:52] <mooncup> wait
[17:13:54] <mooncup> ignore me
[17:14:53] <tasaif> that moment when you realize you've been working on the wrong specs for 2 days
[17:16:26] <youness1307> I tried this too https://www.refheap.com/98338 but it's the same result.  code 401 unauthorized
[17:19:13] <cordovafan8> argh, does anyone have any experience with the 'slider()' widget for jquery 1.3 ?
[17:19:27] <cordovafan8> err jquery mobile 1.3
[17:25:34] <alfredo> (mooncup) any idea about youness1307 problem?
[17:38:30] <cordovafan8> Hello again. I am trying to make a  simple flip-toggle switch with jquery mobile 1.3. The documentation suggests using the  'slider' widget.. but the example doesn't seem to work at all? I have a jsfiddle with the exact example given here: http://api.jquerymobile.com/1.3/slider/
[17:39:18] <cordovafan8> here is the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=y4GmPKP0JH
[17:39:46] <cordovafan8> this does not look anything like what they describe in the documentation
[17:39:47] <tirengarfio> I have this code to detect the bottom of the document but it doesn't work for me: http://jsfiddle.net/k3mfaw0o/
[17:39:52] <cordovafan8> or am I missing the boat entirely here?
[17:40:58] <cordovafan8> sorry it looks like I linked a weird collaboration thing
[17:41:04] <cordovafan8> here is the real fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/1gdy1vod/
[17:41:37] <in_deep_thought> how can I access the a href elements of my table? looping through them? I have this: https://bpaste.net/show/2400ef69ae00   and I want to use a .each() function on the a href elements. I know I can do $(“td”) to get the td elements but I want the a inside
[17:45:39] <in_deep_thought> I also tried $(“td a”) but no such luck……
[17:53:18] <tasaif> in_deep_thought: can you make a fiddle
[17:56:14] <cordovafan8> I am at my wits end with this. I think the documentation is incorrect here: http://api.jquerymobile.com/1.3/slider/   . Does anyone know of another way to get a flip-switch slider in jquery mobile 1.3?
[17:57:22] <in_deep_thought> tasaif: http://jsfiddle.net/8co6tu9s/
[17:57:51] <in_deep_thought> tasaif: wait
[17:57:55] <in_deep_thought> that works
[17:57:58] <in_deep_thought> wth
[17:58:40] <tasaif> in_deep_thought: don't you see deep thought… you've had the answer inside of you the entire time
[17:58:53] <tasaif> cordovafan8: put it in a fiddle
[17:59:01] <in_deep_thought> ah i went too deep
[17:59:32] <tasaif> http://thats.so.deep.jpg.to
[17:59:57] <tasaif> also the name of my favorite waiter at the indian restaurant
[18:05:36] <in_deep_thought> lol never seen that
[18:05:57] <in_deep_thought> is that a real name? or does it just sound like it?
[18:09:07] <cordovafan8> tasaif: I posted a fiddle up there somewhere let me find
[18:09:38] <cordovafan8> tasaif: https://jsfiddle.net/1gdy1vod/  << this is the example from the jquery mobile documentation on the slider widget
[18:09:51] <cordovafan8> it doesn't seem to work at all to me
[18:19:50] <nonconvergent> Trying to do a jQuery validator on a form with bootstrap, but the error messages have the 'display: none !important' style on it.
[18:22:17] <jeffmjack> does closest also search for 'uncles'?
[18:22:41] <jeffmjack> like, not a direct ancestor, but a sibling to a direct ancestor?
[18:22:45] <tasaif> cordovafan8: and what are you trying to make it do?
[18:24:25] <tasaif> I'm going home
[18:24:27] <cordovafan8> tasaif: http://api.jquerymobile.com/1.3/slider/ << ctrl-f for 'flip-switch'. I want a nice mobile-style on/off switch
[18:24:33] <tasaif> ah ok
[18:24:46] <cordovafan8> which is what the documentation claims it does
[18:24:59] <cordovafan8> but it doesn't seem to obey it's own styling
[18:28:02] <tasaif> cordovafan8:
[18:28:11] <tasaif> it's telling you slider dne
[18:29:34] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/mp02u7ec/
[18:29:35] <in_deep_thought> tasaif: I fancied up the table selection a bit. now I am trying to access only the td a elements of a certain table, but I get Uncaught RangeError: Maxiumum callstak size exceeded http://jsfiddle.net/8co6tu9s/3/ . What is this and how do I avoid it?
[18:30:20] <tasaif> there was something wrong with your fiddle. the libraries weren't being loaded correctly.
[18:30:25] <tasaif> so I made a new fiddle
[18:31:25] <in_deep_thought> my fiddle?
[18:31:34] <tasaif> nope that was cordovafan8
[18:31:40] <tasaif> yours is here
[18:31:41] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/8co6tu9s/4/
[18:31:51] <tasaif> you weren't selecting the table properly
[18:32:20] <tasaif> you were calling each on an empty list
[18:32:25] <in_deep_thought> ah I just needed the .play before the td?
[18:32:29] <tasaif> yep
[18:32:34] <in_deep_thought> cool thanks
[18:32:53] <tasaif> just for clarity
[18:33:07] <tasaif> td.play will return all td elements that have the class 'play'
[18:33:44] <in_deep_thought> as opposed to the .play tables td elements
[19:17:06] <coderzm> Hi all, i have WP site with a few rows of dynamically added content. each box has two buttons. the second one opens a contact form upon click.
[19:17:26] <quizme> browser caching is usually set by the web server.  can jquery (or javascript) set javascript-generated doms/pages to be browser-cached so that when you click on reload everything loads from the browser cache?
[19:17:57] <coderzm> I tried using :target selector to display the hidden contact form, but it only works for the first row. Therefore, I am using jquery. but it doesn't display the contact form properly as seen: http://tch-wordpress.maxnathaniel.com/programmes/students-undergraduates/
[19:18:28] <coderzm> I am using .on() function to display the contact form upon click of button

[21:23:51] <lior9999> Hello. Is anyone willing to help me with an issue grabbing html text using .text() ?
[21:31:29] <lior9999> Anyone here? :(
[21:32:16] <jqueryius> hi
[21:32:26] <jqueryius> $('input[name=modify-item]:checked').val();
[21:32:47] <jqueryius> but what if no option is checked?
[21:33:05] <lior9999> Pretty much everyone here is afk, mate.
[21:33:18] <jqueryius> :(
[21:33:23] <lior9999> Tell me about it...
[21:33:31] <jqueryius> are you watching the world cup lior9999?
[21:33:44] <lior9999> Na, watching League of Legends lol.
[21:34:03] <jqueryius> I just figured from your phrasing you were australian
[21:34:33] <lior9999> Ah. No, I just like the word 'mate'.
[21:34:55] <lior9999> Actually, jqueryius, maybe you're better at jquery than I am. Are you able to help me with a small issue I'm having
[21:34:56] <lior9999> ?
[21:35:09] <lior9999> lol
[21:35:34] <jqueryius> sure
[21:35:46] <jqueryius> I'll do what I can to help
[21:36:21] <lior9999> Thanks. Well here's a simplified version of my problem:
[21:36:22] <lior9999> $('.ot_tr_ordernum', this).text()
[21:36:49] <lior9999> where class ot_tr_ordernum is a <td>, and 'this' is a specific table row.
[21:37:51] <lior9999> It keeps giving me "undefined" as the return.
[21:37:56] <lior9999> Not sure what's up with that
[21:38:49] <jqueryius> what if you do html()
[21:38:55] <jqueryius> is that undefined too
[21:40:41] <lior9999> Oh sorry. Yeah, html gives undefined. .text gives nothing (blank).
[21:42:17] <jqueryius> hmm
[21:42:39] <jqueryius> if you just try putting an #id on that particular cell
[21:42:50] <jqueryius> then do ('#cellid').text() does that work?
[21:44:55] <lior9999> Oh wait, I just figured it out. I think my 'this' was referencing every row of my table, not the particular row I was interested in.
[21:45:20] <jqueryius> I must be really good
[21:45:31] <jqueryius> Problem solver extrodinaire!
[21:48:01] <lior9999> Haha.
[21:51:47] <rsumi> why doesn’t jquery mobile use the iife wrappers as jquery? it would be nice if it just worked like jquery out of the box if the wrapper was function(window){  }(typeof window !== ‘undefined’? window || this);
[21:53:55] <lior9999> I know right!
[21:54:01] <lior9999> (I have no idea what you're talking about)
[21:54:03] <NinjaBanjo> jquery ui sucks
[21:54:08] * NinjaBanjo leaves.
[21:54:14] <lior9999> #ragequit
[21:54:35] <NinjaBanjo> lol. sorry , i saw jquery ui and had an opinion.
[21:56:41] <jqueryius> are you from england lior9999
[21:59:21] <tasaif> no, he just likes to say mate
[22:00:40] <lior9999> Yeah. I'm from good 'ol 'Murica.
[22:03:04] <jqueryius> ah
[22:03:15] <jqueryius> hang on rebooting
[22:26:48] <tasaif> chrome
[23:20:15] <ericP> var elt = $("<span>a</span>"); $("#x").append("asdf", elt);
[23:20:35] <ericP> how does jquery know that elt is a jquery node?
[23:21:20] <ericP> Object.prototype.toString.call(elt) says that it's an Object, which doesn't seem discriminating
[23:22:35] <ericP> (i have a logger which i'd like to behave differently if an argument is a jquery node vs. some random toString()-able.)
[23:22:55] <arthurvr> I would need to search how the append method exactly recognises it, but this is one possible way: http://jsbin.com/balizirase/1/edit
[23:23:33] <arthurvr> `api .jquery
[23:23:34] <b-ot> arthurvr: No matches.
[23:23:39] <arthurvr> http://api.jquery.com/jquery-2/ :D
[23:24:32] <ericP> arthurvr, that's all i need. many thanks
