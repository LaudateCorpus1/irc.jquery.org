[00:45:01] <SlizardWizard> is it possible to insert a html entity into an elements attribute
[01:05:32] <pavonia> SlizardWizard: You can use the Unicode codepoint directly
[02:32:46] <Cork> SlizardWizard: it is possible as long as you entity encode the content
[05:08:40] <Deusdeorum> How do I write this one? $('label[for="answer634356X3735X61007"+value]').append(...);
[05:09:11] <Deusdeorum> the + value messes stuff up, simply changing answer634356X3735X61007 to answer634356X3735X610071 works. But i have a dynamic value.
[06:28:50] <stennowork> why is that parameter of $.ajax called 'type' and not 'method'
[06:28:53] <stennowork> i typo every time
[06:28:54] <stennowork> :v
[06:39:20] <Uhkis> Deusdeorum: $('label[for="answer634356X3735X61007"'+value+']')
[06:42:26] <Cork> stennowork: it is legacy, method works in newer versions of jquery
[06:42:32] <stennowork> oh!
[06:42:33] <stennowork> fair enoguh
[06:43:15] <stennowork> added in 1.9.0
[08:43:33] <z2y> #join css
[09:44:27] <schiu> hi all. is it somehow possible to use jquery autocomplete for numbers? My autocompletion job should correct an entered number to the next multiple of six (i.e. 2 -> 6, 11 -> 12, 22 -> 24, etc.). Can someone point me in the right direction? Br
[09:57:33] <Cork> schiu: so you just want to force the number to be a multitude of 6?
[09:57:47] <Cork> just use .change and modify the content
[09:59:48] <schiu> Cork: ok, much simpler, thx
[10:00:16] <JrWebDev> i have a <tr class="table-row-button"><td>here be a button boy! <button class="myButton"></button></td></tr>    css file = .myButton { visibility: hidden } ... JQuery file = $(.table-row-button).hover(function() { WHAT DO I PUT HERE? });}
[10:00:28] <JrWebDev> using $(this)
[10:00:38] <JrWebDev> this.button etc.
[10:00:54] <Cork> JrWebDev: why not just use css :hover?
[10:01:30] <JrWebDev> how Cork
[10:02:27] <JrWebDev> i want this.button to be visible when hovering over table=row
[10:02:32] <JrWebDev> table-row
[10:03:18] <Cork> JrWebDev: https://jsfiddle.net/f0n0uxq4/
[10:03:31] <JrWebDev> i tried targeting the button but i guess since its not visible it jquery cant find the button and its attributes correct?
[10:03:42] <Cork> no but it doesn't get events
[10:03:51] <Cork> cause you can't hover something that isn't there
[10:03:57] <JrWebDev> ah
[10:03:57] <JrWebDev> well
[10:04:11] <Cork> but see the jsfiddle
[10:04:15] <JrWebDev> Cork, the table-row aka the <tr> is visible...so when you hover over the <tr> it should show the button
[10:04:23] <Cork> see the fiddle
[10:05:15] <JrWebDev> i was so close
[10:05:15] <JrWebDev> wow
[10:05:17] <JrWebDev> thanks Co
[10:05:21] <JrWebDev> thanks Cork
[10:13:52] <johnnycash3> hi - I have an event listener for mousedown. When I click mouse down on virtual button it selects an input. How do I get the even for the input?
[10:14:04] <johnnycash3> even/event*
[10:16:19] <Cork> johnnycash3: what do you mean? you bind an event handler for the input
[10:48:22] <catbadger> I'm working on a very large legacy system. I can't switch the tech (client request)... They have a mess of script tags, but are using requirejs... some of their code isn't AMD compatible, and requires $ globally... so my question is, can requirejs load jquery globally, or are we stuck loading it in a script tag
[10:48:37] <johnnycash3> Cork: ye - I binded an event handler....im new to this stuff :-/.
[10:50:42] <twg_> Morning everyone
[10:51:02] <catbadger> my thoughts are to just window.$ = required_$ inside the require callback.
[10:51:10] <catbadger> morning twg_
[10:52:10] <twg_> This might be a simple question but I'm not well versed in jquery.  I have 5 image place holders that I need to randomly switch out for different images every 30 seconds.  Can anyone help me with this?
[10:55:11] <Cork> twg_: what do you have this far?
[10:55:32] <twg_> Let me throw it up in a codePen
[10:55:42] <Cork> jsfiddle.net preferably
[11:08:38] <twg_> Cork: Here it is.  https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/o1fjy645/ .  Sorry, had someone walk into my office to ask me a question.
[11:09:45] <Cork> np
[11:10:30] <Cork> twg_: and how do you want to replace the images?
[11:10:49] <Cork> do you just want to shuffel them or replace them with a static list or what?
[11:11:15] <twg_> I was thinking of just looking inside a specific directory and then grabbing 5 random images and then just randomly switching them out every 30 seconds.
[11:17:17] <localh0st> twg_: you don't have an access to the filesystem using jquery, so if you would like to scan for images in some directory you would need to go for PHP for example or just prepare an URL list and keep it in JS, then use random function to pick the urls from the array and replace them using js code
[11:17:24] <localh0st> using javascript*
[11:18:19] <twg_> Okay.  That makes sense.  I can even define them in the javscript code.  I will be the one changing them so it wouldn't be hard for me to do.
[11:18:23] <localh0st> twg_: what is the issue you've stuck on?
[11:19:13] <twg_> I'm not sure how to take a list of images and then radomly change the even child elements to a different image every 30 seconds.
[11:23:25] <Cork> twg_: ok so you want a global list of replacement images, or one per image?
[11:24:13] <twg_> I have 5 spots and 15 images and I want to pick a random one from the list every 30 seconds and then replace 1 of the 5 with it.
[11:24:14] <Cork> if you want the later you could do something like have a list of filenames (not the full url) and do something like <img src="full url" data-images="["img1""img2""img3""img4""img5"]">
[11:24:49] <Cork> ok so just a global one
[11:26:35] <localh0st> twg_: https://jsfiddle.net/o1fjy645/1/
[11:26:44] <localh0st> basically this is simple example
[11:27:15] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/o1fjy645/2/ is what i would do
[11:28:40] <twg_> Thanks Cork and localh0st.  I will look at both of yours and try them out.
[11:38:28] <twg_> Cork can I ask you a question about your example?
[11:38:36] <Cork> sure
[11:39:22] <twg_> Your's just finds any image on the page correct?  So I would just need to specify a class to narrow it down correct?
[11:39:31] <Cork> exactly
[11:39:45] <twg_> Okay.  Just wanted to make sure.
[11:42:27] <twg_> What would I do to pick on of my 5 spots with no text at random to change?
[11:42:41] <twg_> Cork:
[11:44:27] <Cork> twg_: you mean you just want to replace one image at a time?
[11:44:36] <twg_> Yes.
[11:45:08] <twg_> For example, I want #3 to replace and then 30 seconds later #1, then #2, then #5, etc.
[11:45:36] <Cork> twg_: https://jsfiddle.net/o1fjy645/3/
[11:45:58] <Cork> eq grabs the element from the result matching the number
[11:46:10] <Cork> so basically run two separate rands :)
[11:49:16] <twg_> awesome.  thanks.
[11:58:25] <frank_> Hi, I'm using datatables.net and when one of the strings in the columns is having a special character, I'm getting "malformed utf-8 characters possibly incorrectly encoded "
[11:58:40] <frank_> I just want to be able to display all characters
[11:58:57] <frank_> Anyone know where or what to set?
[12:00:46] <Cork> frank_: make sure the original source encodes the string as utf-8 before sending it
[12:00:47] <tarwater> i've got a bunch of jquery mobile buttons (checkboxes). when i click one it puts the blue focus only on the very first one, and also brings the window to that element
[12:00:58] <tarwater> i cant figure out why. going insane. pls.
[12:01:29] <Cork> frank_: the old iso standards or ascii has lower bytes that aren't allowed in utf8
[12:01:51] <Cork> (as they have a different number for it)
[12:02:00] <Cork> uh *it*
[12:02:10] <frank_> Should I just set my page to a different one then? The database has utf8_unicode_ci
[12:02:27] <frank_> the html page has this: <meta charset="UTF-8">
[12:02:51] <Cork> no, but either it is accepting to store broken utf8 or something is converting it afterwards
[12:04:16] <Cork> frank_: also note that the server needs to set the http header to contain utf8 for encoding or it will default to ascii
[12:04:31] <Cork> if you send the data as json for example
[12:04:36] <Cork> just having the page as utf8 isn't enough
[12:04:44] <frank_> oh
[12:04:46] <frank_> how do I do that?
[12:05:22] <Cork> in the content-type header
[12:05:25] <frank_> is UTF-8 the same as UTF8_unicode_ci?
[12:05:28] <Cork> ex Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
[12:05:31] <Cork> yes
[12:09:22] <frank_> The page is html though
[12:09:48] <Cork> and you put the data for the datatable inline in the page?
[12:09:51] <frank_> I put this: header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8'); but still get the error, maybe it's a problem with datatables.net
[12:10:12] <stennowork> sounds like a backend problem
[12:10:26] <stennowork> i am using datatables and have no problem iwth utf-8
[12:10:29] <Cork> ya, the problem is finding where
[12:10:36] <Cork> stennowork: we already know that
[12:10:48] <Cork> the problem is something is encoding the utf8 from the database as something else
[12:11:05] <Cork> finding where is what we're currently looking for
[12:11:07] <stennowork> whats your backend?
[12:11:29] <Cork> from what it looks like php + mysql
[12:11:29] <frank_> PHP with Laravel
[12:11:43] <frank_> I also use a laravel package to interact with the datatables
[12:12:23] <frank_> yajra/laravel-datatables-oracle
[12:13:21] <stennowork> and the value is correct in the database?
[12:13:45] <frank_> yes
[12:14:47] <frank_> It has special e's and i's
[12:14:54] <frank_> with apostrophes on it
[12:15:00] <frank_> even chinese charactesr
[12:15:53] <Cork> you mean Ã© ?
[12:16:00] <frank_> yes
[12:16:08] <frank_> I jsut did SELECT @@character_set_database and it gives UTF8
[12:16:37] <Cork> i would inspect the data transfer that yajra has with the page
[12:16:43] <Cork> cause i suspect the problem comes from there
[12:18:20] <frank_> I don't even know where to begin to check that
[12:18:39] <Cork> the browsers developer tools network tab is a good start
[12:19:10] <Cork> if what you see there is broken you know it happens server side from them
[12:19:28] <Cork> or it or what you're suppose to call it
[12:21:13] <frank_> oddly when I put the strings through htmlentities() - it does show
[12:21:33] <Cork> hmm
[12:21:49] <Cork> if you check the page info does it say the page is utf8?
[12:22:45] <Cork> (run document.characterSet in a console)
[12:23:23] <frank_> returns UTF-8
[12:23:32] <Cork> weird...
[12:24:03] <frank_> I've isolated the column where the problem happens
[12:24:07] <Cork> that htmlentities() helps means something is encoding things in something other then utf8
[12:24:09] <frank_> return Html::mailto(htmlentities($user->email), htmlentities($user->email))
[12:24:09] <frank_>                     . ' <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="' . $user->present()->profileUrl . '">profile</a>';
[12:24:21] <frank_> if I comment that out, it works
[12:24:46] <Cork> uh, that writes a mail...
[12:25:11] <frank_> Html::mailto($user->email, $user->email);
[12:25:17] <frank_> this line is problematic
[12:25:19] <Cork> hmm or it might be some form of helper to create a <a href="mailto:"> i suppose
[12:25:32] <frank_> Cork: yes it's a helper
[12:25:59] <Cork> so the server script doesn't support utf8, either check for an option for encoding or ya... not really on topic for this channel
[12:26:24] <Cork> a channel for the framework or ##php is prob a better choice
[12:26:39] <Cork> haven't touch php much is close to 6 years >_>
[12:27:12] <frank_> if I don't use that helper it works :|
[12:28:06] <stennowork> maybe that generates invalid html
[12:28:22] <Cork> more likely it generates an encoding that isn't utf8
[12:29:19] <Cork> i would suspect something like iso8859-1
[12:30:54] <stennowork> i don't get it, wasn't the _page_ encoding set to utf-8 ?
[12:31:03] <Cork> sure, and?
[12:31:11] <Cork> that's just a meta tag in the header
[12:31:17] <stennowork> and you think that the email helper changes the page encoding?
[12:31:28] <Cork> what the script runs server side to generate the content doesn't dictate that
[12:31:35] <Cork> not page encoding
[12:31:43] <Cork> but the encoding of the text it takes as input
[12:31:58] <stennowork> ah i see now
[12:32:10] <stennowork> its an actual entry in the table
[12:32:28] <stennowork> and that entry is a mailto: link generated by that helper on the server side
[12:32:34] <Cork> yup
[12:32:48] <frank_> let me paste the code of that helper
[12:33:04] <Cork> frank_: you should take it to a relevant channel
[12:33:16] <Cork> this is not js related and definitely not jquery related
[12:33:19] <frank_> I thought you'd be interested to knopw
[12:33:25] <frank_> It's already solved so
[12:33:52] <Cork> ah
[12:34:07] <stennowork> solved by just not rendering a mailto: link? :P
[12:34:19] <Cork> by using htmlentity i suspect
[12:34:25] <Cork> so sending it as ascii
[12:34:38] <Cork> (that is forward compatible with utf8)
[12:37:07] <stennowork> that 'obfuscation' is terrible
[12:38:21] <Cork> obfuscation?
[12:38:49] <stennowork> just looked at the laravel source code
[12:38:52] <Cork> ah
[12:39:03] <stennowork> 279:         $email = '&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#058;'.$email;
[12:39:13] <Cork> heh
[12:39:18] <taplar> pretty
[12:39:31] <Cork> so hex entity encode each charcter to prevent spam spiters...
[12:39:56] <Cork> *spiders -_-'
[12:40:21] <stennowork> no its just like a magic string they prepend to the email address
[12:40:27] <taplar> i remember doing something like that one upon a time
[12:41:41] <stennowork> actually idk what they are doing there
[12:42:28] <tarwater> can anyone think of why a checkbox group would behave oddly in a pop-up (jquery mobile). but work fine elsewhere?
[12:42:33] <Cork> stennowork: it is "mailto:"
[12:42:37] <Cork> not exactly magical
[12:42:53] <stennowork> oh ok
[12:43:32] <stennowork> so its not hex but decimal
[12:43:45] <pavonia> But weird to use entities for that
[12:44:02] <Cork> prob to make life harder for spiters, like i said
[12:44:03] <frank_> I just typed the html directly without the helper
[12:44:28] <stennowork> hah
[12:44:28] <Cork> ... spiDers... *sigh*
[12:44:47] <taplar> freudian
[12:45:02] <Cork> frank_: be careful so you don't write the emails directly into a public page though
[12:45:16] <Cork> cause if you do the users are going to have a hay day with all the spam...
[12:45:42] <frank_> nono, it's for in the admin section
[12:46:02] <frank_> I've learned the hardway no to put email up for grabs on public pages
[12:46:38] <twg_> anyone here work with esc6?
[12:47:03] <robertmaxrees> you mean ES6?
[12:47:22] <twg_> hahaha, yes
[12:47:30] <twg_> can you tell i don't? :D
[12:47:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:47:59] <stennowork> most likely related to ##javascript
[12:48:55] <frank_> Do you guys think jquery has a future?
[12:49:01] <taplar> lol
[12:49:02] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:49:05] <robertmaxrees> sure does.
[12:49:21] <twg_> can't find out why it's telling me that it can't find $.fn when I've got jquery declared.  https://kopy.io/aPxwi#nn24VjZirrNW3y
[12:49:23] <frank_> I'm thinking Vue.js will take over
[12:49:24] <stennowork> if the dom stays as crappy as it is
[12:49:35] <robertmaxrees> frank_ vue does soemthing different.
[12:49:37] <taplar> not everyone runs php
[12:49:39] <robertmaxrees> vue, angular, react, etc.
[12:49:47] <taplar> or larvel for that matter
[12:50:02] <frank_> it's all interacting with the dom
[12:50:09] <frank_> but yeah vue is more for UI elements
[12:50:19] <robertmaxrees> vue is an MV*
[12:51:09] <taplar> and so long as facebook is behind it, react will be accepted by many people as it is
[12:51:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:51:31] <robertmaxrees> jQuery doesn't serve that purpose.
[12:51:54] <stennowork> as i understood it, jquery is first and foremost a library to make dom interaction more pleasant
[12:52:03] <taplar> uniform
[12:52:04] <frank_> facebook is behind jquery?
[12:52:12] <taplar> facebook develops react
[12:52:15] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:52:27] <robertmaxrees> stennowork that's the basic gist.
[12:52:41] <robertmaxrees> smooth over inconsistencies, simplify some things, etc./
[12:53:13] <stennowork> and stuff like angular are frontend mvc or mvvm or so frameworks
[12:53:28] <robertmaxrees> yep, MV*
[12:53:40] <stennowork> ah, never saw that abbreviation before
[12:54:01] <robertmaxrees> even better, angular (and probably others) use jquery under the hood: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.element
[12:54:19] <stennowork> i remember using backbone.js
[12:54:36] <stennowork> i doubt that its still a thing because it just doesnt pop up in ##javascript lol
[12:54:48] <taplar> it's still around afaik
[12:55:11] <robertmaxrees> we use it.
[12:55:14] <stennowork> yeah but probably as 'around' as prototype is
[12:55:23] <robertmaxrees> backbone's still a viable choice.
[12:55:27] <stennowork> nice
[12:55:33] <stennowork> glad to see that its doing well
[12:55:51] <taplar> how come?
[12:56:07] <stennowork> i liked the framework
[12:56:22] <taplar> i'm always interested when i see people being attached to a language
[12:56:47] <stennowork> oh its not a language, its a framework
[12:57:01] <taplar> in general, attached to a way of doing things
[12:57:04] <stennowork> it was(is?) very lightweight
[12:57:18] <stennowork> and not as intrusive as angular with all the ng- tages
[12:57:20] <stennowork> tags
[12:58:10] <stennowork> i have a faible for lightweight, customizable frameworks in general
[12:58:18] <stennowork> because they are usually easily extendable
[12:58:48] <stennowork> this is the whole of backbone http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html
[12:59:15] <stennowork> (uses jquery too apparently)
[12:59:35] <stennowork> (but it doesn't rely on it)
[12:59:50] <stennowork> since my early rails days, i have come to hate convention over configuration
[13:00:15] <stennowork> it only works if you do exactly what the framework devs thought would be the most likely use case
[13:00:24] <stennowork> and thats almost always not the case
[13:00:44] <taplar> which usually means you just need to find a more suitable tool
[13:00:57] <stennowork> yep
[13:00:59] <stennowork> a better tool
[13:01:09] <taplar> better for that situation
[13:01:14] <taplar> 'better' is relative
[13:01:18] <stennowork> one where i can configure the shit out of however i like
[13:01:26] <tarwater> can somebody please look at this and help: http://jsfiddle.net/co927zky/
[13:01:57] <tarwater> why, in the popup, does the focus not change. and why if you click the bottom element does it go to the top
[13:02:43] <tarwater> i can lose the blue focus, i dont care, but why does clicking the bottom change the scroll position
[13:03:39] <robertmaxrees> tarwater fwiw your page doesn't include jquery.
[13:03:47] <robertmaxrees> need both jquery and jquery mobile.
[13:03:58] <tarwater> that's no the issue
[13:04:12] <tarwater> i just forked a bad hiddle
[13:04:16] <robertmaxrees> sure, but it'll make troubleshooting things harder ;)
[13:04:16] <tarwater> jfiddle*
[13:04:39] <tarwater> i've been stuck on this for like 3 hours
[13:10:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting a console error when clicking.  that might be it.
[13:10:46] <robertmaxrees> on that's on pageload./
[13:12:29] <tarwater> i don't know what to do :(
[13:13:13] <robertmaxrees> are you getting a console error on pageload?
[13:13:39] <tarwater> only on jiddle, not in my project with the same code
[13:17:19] <tarwater> it only happens in jquery mobile 1.4.5
[13:17:21] <tarwater> it must be a bug
[13:17:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:18:11] <tarwater> fuck
[13:19:12] <taplar> with tenacity
[13:55:21] <tarwater> i made a stackover question about my issue
[13:55:31] <tarwater> no one ever answer my stack overflows though -_-

[14:17:56] <ThatWebGuy> I'm trying to add a transition to my image changes with some existing code.  Can anyone help?  https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/o1fjy645/5/
[14:19:06] <robertmaxrees> ThatWebGuy so where are you getting stuck?
[14:20:15] <ThatWebGuy> robertmaxrees: On line 21 I've tried to add a .fadeOut(1000).next().fadeIn(1000).end(); but all that does is fade out my image and nothing ever fades in.
[14:22:10] <MikeD_> what's the .next() doing?
[14:22:50] <ThatWebGuy> MikeD_ not sure.  I was looking at examples online and they used it so I thought I needed to.
[14:23:53] <robertmaxrees> you need to find the next image.
[14:23:59] <robertmaxrees> .next() isn't doing that for you./
[14:24:14] <robertmaxrees> .next() grabs the "next" sibling element.
[14:24:21] <ThatWebGuy> okay.
[14:24:42] <ThatWebGuy> Well line 21 changes the src to the new URL
[14:25:21] <robertmaxrees> you want to fade the image out and then fade it in, then?
[14:25:53] <ThatWebGuy> yeah.  Just trying to add a small transition versus abrupt change.
[14:27:00] <MikeD_> wouldn't the fade in be based on the event that the content is loaded?
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> so you want $theImg.fadeOut('slow', function() { $theImg.prop('src', newSrc);  $theImg.fadeIn('slow'); })
[14:27:15] <robertmaxrees> or something like thjat.
[14:27:34] <ThatWebGuy> yeah
[14:27:56] <robertmaxrees> so give that a shot :)
[14:31:55] <ThatWebGuy> robertmaxrees: that worked like a charm.  Thanks for the help.
[14:32:06] <robertmaxrees> deffo
[15:35:09] <ThatWebGuy> Still around robertmaxrees ?
[15:35:55] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:36:19] <ThatWebGuy> Could I talk something threw with you to see if I'm going in the right direction?
[15:37:04] <robertmaxrees> no need to ask to ask - toss your question out to the channel and if somebody can help, they will :)
[15:37:46] <ThatWebGuy> So I have this code so far and it working great.  https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/o1fjy645/7/
[15:39:03] <ThatWebGuy> What I'm trying to do now after some feedback is to check to see if the image already exists in one of the divs that's selected.  If so, run the action again.  Else insert the new image.  But I also need to check to see if I'm updating the same div again.
[15:39:31] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:39:42] <ThatWebGuy> I've noticed when watching the code run, sometimes the same image will be put on 3 different divs and then the very last div that was update will then be updated again.
[15:39:51] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:39:57] <robertmaxrees> you're dealing with random numbers.
[15:40:13] <ThatWebGuy> So I'm trying to figure out should I check the div first to see if it was the last one updated or should I check to see if the image exists first
[15:40:42] <ThatWebGuy> True.  The same div updating I can deal with.  Having the same image on there multiple times is what is the big issue.
[15:40:57] <robertmaxrees> so then check those conditions.
[15:41:05] <robertmaxrees> why would the order matter there?
[15:41:30] <ThatWebGuy> On if the same div updates right after it already updated?
[15:41:40] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:41:47] <robertmaxrees> but you're going to run 2 checks.
[15:41:57] <ThatWebGuy> What do you mean order matter?
[15:42:04] <ThatWebGuy> I guess I'm misunderstanding
[15:42:10] <robertmaxrees> back up - what are you asking, exactly?
[15:43:06] <ThatWebGuy> If you go watch the slider for a minute, you will notice that on the 5 boxes without text, you will get the same image on multiple boxes at the same time.  My boss doesn't want that.  They don't want to see the same image on multiple boxes at the same time.
[15:43:23] <robertmaxrees> we've established that aprt.
[15:43:32] <ThatWebGuy> They also said that they would like it if the box just changed images for it to not change on the next internval again.
[15:43:35] <robertmaxrees> you've made a bunch of statements about the problem but haven't asked a question.
[15:43:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:44:09] <ThatWebGuy> Well since we remove the last issue I'm just down to one which I guess does answer my question.  :D
[15:44:17] <ThatWebGuy> These 11 hour days are killing me.
[15:44:26] <robertmaxrees> kay.
[15:44:36] <robertmaxrees> should probably step away for a little bit ;)
[15:45:00] <ThatWebGuy> Wish I got that luxury at where I work but I don't.
[15:45:22] <ThatWebGuy> I'm the only developer so I've gotta always be here to answer phone calls, emails, and code. :/
[15:45:49] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[15:46:09] <robertmaxrees> the cost of making you do that much work is higher than if they just hired somebodyu else.
[15:46:53] <ThatWebGuy> HAHAHA.  I've been asking for an additional coder for 5 years.  No where in the budget yet.
[15:47:19] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point - it'll actually be cheaper if they hire somebody else ;)
[15:48:04] <ThatWebGuy> Oh I know.  And we could actually get more projects done quicker.
[15:48:19] <robertmaxrees> plus you'd become that much more effective./
[15:48:43] <robertmaxrees> overworking is a pretty big problem.
[15:50:12] <ThatWebGuy> Yeah.  Everyone I talk to in higher education says that as well.
[16:00:11] <ThatWebGuy> robertmaxrees: I think I'm doing my check wrong.  https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/o1fjy645/8/
[16:04:00] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/ -> the second arg is an array. not a jquery object.
[16:04:03] <robertmaxrees> you'
[16:04:10] <robertmaxrees> *you're using the wrong method.
[16:04:25] <ThatWebGuy> Ahhh, okay
[16:04:55] <robertmaxrees> need to check the .prop('src') of those elements instead.
[16:05:01] <robertmaxrees> that's a quick .filter() job.,
[16:19:55] <ThatWebGuy> robertmaxrees: Okay so i've got it getting everything but I'm comparing a full URL to just a filename.  Any suggestions? https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/o1fjy645/12/
[16:29:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:29:22] <robertmaxrees> i thought you wanted to run an if there,.
[16:30:44] <ThatWebGuy> I thought I would have to do an each so I could check to see if the image already existed in either of the five divs.
[16:30:49] <ThatWebGuy> And then do my if
[16:30:55] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:31:03] <robertmaxrees> i suggested .filter() for the job.
[16:31:09] <robertmaxrees> any reason you ignored that? :)
[16:31:24] <ThatWebGuy> I read the first one and then started working.
[16:31:30] <ThatWebGuy> I didn't read the second post.
[16:31:40] <ThatWebGuy> My bad
[16:31:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:32:35] <robertmaxrees> even better - you could .map() ther elements into an array of image src strings and then compare the two arrays.
[16:37:38] <ThatWebGuy> robertmaxrees: okay.  let me do some reading on .map() then.
[16:38:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/o1fjy645/13/
[16:38:04] <robertmaxrees> btw
[16:38:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:38:13] <robertmaxrees> check out the jquery docs
[17:27:27] <tocka> evening
[17:27:35] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[17:27:58] <tocka> quick question, I have a list of dynamically generated field names and I will be sending them via ajax
[17:28:23] <tocka> when I generate them I make them so their name would be platform[1], platform[2] etc.. so name="platform[1]"
[17:28:33] <tocka> Before I was using this line of code to get all of the fields
[17:28:35] <tocka> platforms' : $('select[name="platforms[]"]').map(function(){return $(this).val();}).get(),
[17:28:45] <tocka> but it doesnt work anymore as im numbering them
[17:29:01] <tocka> how can I update this line of code so it would pick up fields again?
[17:38:26] <robertmaxrees> give them a class.
[17:38:29] <robertmaxrees> and then select the class.
[18:00:07] <jsnewbie0087> I have a string that is a url and I need to grab just the last part of it.  How would I do this?  It will be a filename at the end for an image, docx, etc.
[18:00:56] <robertmaxrees> cloud always .split('/') then grab the last index of that array.
[18:02:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/j8hqmgmc/ jsnewbie0087
[18:05:01] <jsnewbie0087> Worked like a charm.  Thanks.
[18:05:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:16:13] <ThatWebGuy> Well robertmaxrees i've created a infinite loop evidently.  LOL
[18:16:17] <ThatWebGuy> https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/o1fjy645/15/
[18:16:31] <ThatWebGuy> I've been trying to figure out how I did it but I've been lost for the last few hours.
[18:17:35] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use filter there.
[18:18:02] <ThatWebGuy> Pounding head against the wall.
[18:18:04] <ThatWebGuy> Okay
[18:18:06] <robertmaxrees> did you read up about what filter does?
[18:18:52] <ThatWebGuy> Yes.  You pass the variable you want to filter against a collection and then what you want to do to it.
[18:19:03] <robertmaxrees> kind of.
[18:19:07] <robertmaxrees> you're using it wrong.
[18:19:40] <ThatWebGuy> Okay.
[18:19:44] <ThatWebGuy> Back to reading
[18:19:47] <robertmaxrees> the function should return true or false and then you get back a jquery collection back on whatever passes the test.
[18:20:55] <robertmaxrees> ThatWebGuy so back up.
[18:21:01] <ThatWebGuy> Okay
[18:21:23] <robertmaxrees> you just wanna know if any of the current images match random_image, right?
[18:22:06] <ThatWebGuy> Yes
[18:22:15] <ThatWebGuy> That way I don't show them again.
[18:22:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/o1fjy645/16/
[18:22:43] <robertmaxrees> this is one way to do it.
[18:24:00] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[18:24:04] <ThatWebGuy> Okay.  Say my array of images is just the filename and not the entire url.  The allUsedImages returns a full URL.
[18:24:31] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:25:02] <robertmaxrees> so then you want to check $(this).prop('src') and see if it contains that substring, right?
[18:25:12] <ThatWebGuy> Or should my URL in the array I'm storing be the full URL?
[18:25:21] <ThatWebGuy> Yes
[18:25:36] <robertmaxrees> soooo how do you check to see if a string contains a particular substring in JS?
[18:26:45] <ThatWebGuy> indexOf?
[18:26:51] <robertmaxrees> bingo
[18:26:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/o1fjy645/17/ ;)
[18:35:35] <ThatWebGuy> robertmaxrees: so that gives me an array of the 5 images that are bing used.  How is that any different from the elms?
[18:36:15] <robertmaxrees> errr
[18:36:32] <robertmaxrees> this tells you if any of the current images on the page are using the new random image.
[18:37:58] <ThatWebGuy> sorry, forgot the length on the console.log
[18:37:59] <robertmaxrees> with that knowledge you can then decide whether or not to re-run the random image logic.
[18:41:18] <ThatWebGuy> gotcha.
[18:41:22] <ThatWebGuy> Works like a charm now.
[18:41:51] <ThatWebGuy> Only quirk i've noticed is that if it hits the same image it could run longer than the set 5 seconds to display one finally.
[18:42:07] <robertmaxrees> marginally longer.
[18:42:08] <ThatWebGuy> Just waited 30 seconds for one.  Guess it went through it 6 times before it found one.
[18:42:18] <robertmaxrees> oh, wait.
[18:42:27] <robertmaxrees> you're not re-running the logic when it finds one?
[18:42:37] <robertmaxrees> you're just waiting for the next iteration"?
[18:44:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o1fjy645/18/
[18:44:49] <robertmaxrees> like, you got options for that.
[18:45:03] <robertmaxrees> that's the basic idea.
[18:47:08] <ThatWebGuy> This is what i did.  https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/o1fjy645/19/
[18:48:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're not looking for a new image.
[18:48:08] <robertmaxrees> you're just waiting.
[18:48:12] <robertmaxrees> look at the example I shared./
[18:48:25] <robertmaxrees> not complete but you get the idea.
[18:50:17] <ThatWebGuy> Okay.  Thanks.
[19:19:32] <themediator> can someone help me figure out why this isnt working? https://jsfiddle.net/f8b5h6p5/
[19:26:44] <robertmaxrees> you
[19:26:49] <robertmaxrees> *you're repeating that ID./
[19:27:05] <robertmaxrees> can only have one element with a given ID.  try a class instead.
[19:27:12] <themediator> oooohhhh
[19:28:15] <themediator> https://jsfiddle.net/f8b5h6p5/1/
[19:28:16] <robertmaxrees> your next problem is that you'
[19:28:20] <themediator> Still doesn't seem to work
[19:28:35] <robertmaxrees> *you're using submit, but no form.
[19:28:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f8b5h6p5/2/
[19:29:40] <themediator> hmmmm
[19:29:49] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:29:51] <themediator> The real page has a form with it, I was just trying to dumb it down a bit
[19:29:58] <themediator> for testing
[19:30:02] <robertmaxrees> then the fiddle would need a form.
[19:30:12] <robertmaxrees> buttons don't emit a submit event - forms do.
[19:30:39] <themediator> Okay. Let me test out classes on my actual page to see if that fixes it.
[19:31:37] <robertmaxrees> do you really need to use that global var btw?
[19:33:54] <themediator> The actual webpage is packaging the data in the forms and sending them via ajax request
[19:34:23] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[19:34:29] <themediator> I have two problems. It only collects one form before sending the data, and the data doesn't appear to get to the other end
[19:34:59] <themediator> That's why it is defined as a var in that test
[19:34:59] <themediator> that's all
[19:35:21] <robertmaxrees> 'kay :) totally don't need it, but fair enough.
[19:45:19] <themediator> robertmaxrees: that fixed my main jquery issue, thanks!
[19:46:14] <robertmaxrees> definitely!
