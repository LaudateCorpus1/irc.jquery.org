[00:03:43] <raj> bounce doesn't actually bounce for me
[00:04:01] <raj> it kinda flickers a jumps awkwardly
[00:09:10] <raj> do I do $(this).dialog('destroy') in the `close` option?
[00:12:27] <zoster> still haven't solved it raj :)
[00:13:32] <raj> I have, I'm using an open animation other than 'slow', since it seems that was invalid
[00:13:39] <raj> using 'fade' now instead
[00:13:59] <zoster> fade is better :)
[00:14:09] <raj> byt shoky raised a good point that I was reinitializing new dialogs with my previous click handler
[00:14:10] <zoster> no animations, width/height that sstuff
[00:14:18] <raj> I need to figure out how to destroy on close
[00:16:32] <raj> cuz I want the form reset
[00:19:05] <finspin> jQuery beginner here. I'm trying to figure out why the click event works on "li" element but doesn't work on "a" element. Here is my code http://pastebin.com/gMLi3f4B
[00:19:47] <systemfault> Perhaps the a element needs to be a block element
[00:20:00] <systemfault> Or else, I don't know how it would animate its height.
[00:20:55] <finspin> @systemfault oh, that makes sense. thanks!
[00:23:19] <shoky> raj just destroy right before you re-initialize.  .dialog('destroy').dialog({ show:'raj', ... });
[00:23:46] <shoky> or have an if or whutever
[00:24:30] <raj> that chaining looks messy though =T
[00:25:09] <finspin> hmmm.. tried a new variation of the click event, adding a class instead of animation. still not getting the result i would expect. "li" element changes to red but "a" element doesn't. http://pastebin.com/3jW1Z8mY
[00:25:47] <shoky> raj well does it seem ok if you do it in the close?
[00:26:02] <systemfault> finspin: seems it does: http://jsfiddle.net/f3qRT/
[00:26:09] <raj> i thought it looked cleaner
[00:26:19] <shoky> i mean does it cause anything bad to happen
[00:26:24] <raj> but i'm prolly being anal
[00:26:27] <shoky> if not then sure stick it there
[00:26:29] <shoky> in your anal.
[00:26:30] <raj> it doesn't work in close
[00:26:33] <shoky> oh
[00:26:45] <shoky> what happen?
[00:27:26] <GoH> Hi
[00:27:37] <raj> if I do $(this).dialog('destroy'), and then reclick the link, it'll still have the stuff from before
[00:27:55] <raj> if I do $(this).dialog('destroy').remove(), it won't ever show itself again
[00:27:57] <GoH> I'm having a problem with click events registering when they shouldn't
[00:28:03] <raj> cuz it's removed from the dom I suppose
[00:28:04] <systemfault> finspin: Sorry, I wanted to post that code.. http://jsfiddle.net/f3qRT/1/
[00:28:31] <zoster> try with
[00:28:35] <zoster> $.one();
[00:28:40] <raj> perhaps no way to reset the form
[00:28:46] <finspin> systemfault: you are right. i expected the link would remain red.
[00:29:07] <raj> cuz even destroying just puts it back to its pre-init dom position, and apparently leaves checked boxes checked
[00:29:10] <shoky> raj so how did it get reset before?
[00:29:26] <raj> i think it didn't
[00:29:31] <raj> yes, it didn't
[00:29:38] <shoky> oh
[00:29:57] <shoky> well , yea jquery wont reset your elements for you
[00:30:06] <raj> yeah
[00:30:16] <shoky> so does calling destroy have any bad side effects
[00:30:22] <raj> ok, fine, guess I'll do it the ol' fashioned way -- manually
[00:30:28] <raj> shoky, nope
[00:30:43] <shoky> well oks then youre set ;P
[00:30:45] <finspin> systemfault: ok, so i need to prevent default on the a element
[00:30:45] <raj> but since this is the case, I'm just gonna initialize with autoOpen:false, and then call 'open'
[00:30:53] <raj> that seems cleanest
[00:30:55] <GoH> http://se-aqua.tk/decks/#03hb0ohdbuc2 the problem is that when clicking a card to remove it from the deck, all cards after the card clicked are also removed
[00:30:55] <raj> thanks :)
[00:31:05] * shoky bounce raj
[00:31:14] <raj> i'm not black
[00:31:23] <shoky> don't lie
[00:31:36] <shoky> i saw your cat.
[00:32:31] <GoH> I think this is because the next card in line is moved under the cursor, causing the click to be registed for the next card in line [a div bound with .on()]
[00:33:46] <GoH> I've tried a global variable to lock the event but this has been buggy as well...
[00:35:26] <raj> my cats grey you racist
[00:35:36] <raj> ;)
[00:35:48] <shoky> hueaheuaehauehuehuea
[00:36:32] <raj> anyway, brother, thanks again for the help!
[00:36:35] <raj> I'm in dire need of sleep
[00:36:46] <raj> so I'll catch you en la manana
[00:36:52] <raj> goodnight
[00:37:35] <shoky> niteyy
[00:37:39] <zoster> night night
[00:38:27] <GoH> zoster: I've tried .one()
[00:39:05] <GoH> but the click handler isnt removed from other divs when the first is clicked is it?
[00:40:18] <zoster> $('.selector').each(function() { $(this).undelegate('click'); }); ...
[00:47:38] <shoky> GoH you have a javascript error
[00:47:41] <shoky> look at your console
[00:48:20] <shoky> well it happens from the 2nd time i click a card
[00:48:38] <shoky> FYI, anyways
[00:51:08] <shoky> GoH: also if you put a breakpoint on the line setting the click handlers, you'll see it runs twice on page load
[00:52:08] <shoky> GoH: you're calling DrawDeck twice
[00:53:15] <GoH> are you sure DrawDeck isn't being called the second time because your mousing over a card?
[00:53:50] <GoH> drawdeck is called to resort the z-index of cards when moused over
[00:54:08] <zoster> why resorting z-index?
[00:54:17] <zoster> can't you have multiple items with the same z-index?
[00:54:19] <shoky> GoH: you're also calling it AGAIN when i just mouseover the deck.........
[00:54:36] <GoH> I know there is some redundancy I have to work out
[00:54:47] <GoH> oh
[00:54:58] <GoH> thats probably why I cant get rid of the bindings...
[00:54:59] <GoH> lol
[00:55:00] <shoky> GoH: so you're setting up click handlers again and again
[00:55:11] <GoH> teehee...
[00:55:38] <shoky> you know how to check your console and use the debugger?
[00:56:02] <shoky> set up breakpoints etc
[00:56:23] <GoH> I've been a bit lazy about that
[00:56:28] <shoky> also you should take a look at event delegation
[00:56:38] <shoky> instead of binding a click handler to each card
[00:56:43] <GoH> I've just sort of used alert for debuggin until now
[00:57:01] <GoH> well when a new card is added
[00:57:06] <shoky> you delegate it to a container element, and youonly set up the event binding once at page load, and dont need to bother with it anymore
[00:57:10] <GoH> don't I need to rebind a click?
[00:57:16] <shoky> not if you use delegation, no
[00:57:24] <shoky> ?on @ Goh
[00:57:24] <bot-t> Goh, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:58:33] <shoky> GoH: something like $('#someStaticContainer').on('click', '.deck', handler)
[00:58:55] <GoH> thanks
[00:58:56] <shoky> also-
[00:59:00] <GoH> that should be pretty easy
[00:59:02] <shoky> ?ftj @ GoH
[00:59:02] <bot-t> GoH, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[00:59:06] <GoH> as I'm already using a static container
[00:59:12] <shoky> goodie
[00:59:17] <shoky> should be simple then
[00:59:41] <shoky> even if you didnt have one you can always resort to document or body tag
[00:59:46] <shoky> but its better not to
[00:59:58] <GoH> haha this link looks great
[01:00:28] <GoH> I'm more used to developing in suites and have probably been taking too many shortcuts debugging my js
[01:01:14] <shoky> ;p
[01:04:33] <GoH> what do you prefer for debugging?
[01:05:09] <systemfault> Somebody else to do it for me....
[01:05:23] <systemfault> The Chrome Dev Tools when it's impossible..
[01:06:26] <shoky> yep chrome is definitely my preference
[01:18:07] <cdaringe> good evening again, all.  I have a design Q.  i have a bunch of files stored in a nice hierarchy on my server.  I have a text box, where when the user enters a string, i want them to be able to click a button and show all the files in a directory that is tied to that string.  i need  a function to read that textbox value, call the server directory, query it's contents, and return it to the page.  then, hopefully, allow the user to
[01:18:07] <cdaringe> download the returned files.  any points in a good direction?
[01:19:14] <Mohsen_Hassani> I have lots of images with different IDs. Do I have to write lots of functions for them too? Is there any way to automate it?
[01:19:39] <Mohsen_Hassani> For example I want to have a function for the 20th image, if the user clicks on it, alert('hi, I'm 20');
[01:32:07] <ignoranimous> hello?
[02:02:29] <GoH> shoky: thanks much for the help
[02:02:50] <zoster> on behalf of shoky, "you're quite welcome mate!" :)
[02:02:54] <GoH> haha
[02:03:05] <GoH> thanks to you too man!
[02:03:16] <zoster> :D
[02:10:53] <shoky> np ;p
[03:05:51] <nospinzy>  anyone know of a script that displays database data where you can paginate/order by drop down list, and possibly search via jquery
[03:08:53] <amh345> im trying to swap change some attributes of a bunch of images.   is there a way to only change the attributes of images that are inside <Table> tags?
[03:09:08] <alexander_> why do you use special elements like ul, li, a for the tab. you first kill their default behaviour and than put your own style on top. why don't you use simple elements like div/span ?
[03:10:21] <MagePsycho> any good google map plugin for jquery?
[03:13:52] <mikkelb> my site is about to launch *nervous*
[03:20:27] <TehShrike1> What's the proper way to add a function to a jQuery object so that as it is passed around it will not get relegated to the prevObject property?
[03:25:59] <fraxture> hi all, i need to build a lightbox/colorbox frame that have multiple items.  for example, one colorbox link will open up a frame that needs to allow the user to view several videos. does anyone know of any good solutions for this?
[03:26:47] <alexander_> no
[03:29:28] <TehShrike1> Is there a proper way to extend a single jQuery object with a new property, without the property disappearing later?
[03:30:08] <mikkelb> After years of hard work I am proud to present: http://home.no/hedhnta/
[03:30:23] <riskyshenanigan> when creating a div table, which elements is it necessary to apply a width/height to? the row or the actual elements within that row/
[03:30:26] <riskyshenanigan> ?
[03:30:52] <alexander_> Hi TehShrike1, why dont you use the data method ?
[03:31:25] <TehShrike1> alexander_: because I would like to be able to call the function later by doing my_jquery_object.myFunction()
[03:35:01] <alexander_> TehShrike1: jquery ui elements use the following syntax: $("button").button("option", "label", "bla bla") they dont use $("button").label("bla bla"). I think it is no good style to put addidtional methods on a jquery object, but you con of corse pass an extra object: $.fn.myplugin = function() { return { setLabel: function() { ..do anything } } };
[03:36:36] <TehShrike1> Now as I understand it, creating such a plugin adds the function to all jQuery objects?
[03:36:47] <alexander_> yes
[03:38:13] <TehShrike1> I was trying to avoid that - this function is only appropriate for one type of jQuery object I'm creating in a function
[03:38:42] <alexander_> When you use data the calling syntax would be $("xy").data("myFunction")(). It seems a little bit ugly, but it works
[03:40:08] <amh345> var attr = $('TD').attr('background');  if (typeof attr !== 'undefined' && attr !== false) { }  never returns true, even when i have a TD with a background attribute.  any ideas why?
[03:41:23] <TehShrike1> amh345: as I recall, attr only returns the value for the *first* element it finds
[03:41:39] <TehShrike1> Yay, my memory was correct http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[03:41:45] <amh345> crap.
[03:41:59] <amh345> i need to tweak the source of all my tds with a background image
[03:43:05] <TehShrike1> I think you want $('TD[background]')
[03:46:00] <amh345> if $('TD[background]') ?
[03:47:35] <alexander_> if ($("td[background]").length) ...
[03:57:48] <MagePsycho> any best google map jquey plugins?
[04:17:43] <largehardoncolli> hi
[04:18:07] <alexander_> hi
[04:18:29] <largehardoncolli> question: is (function($){...})(jQuery) implicitly triggered only when dom ready?
[04:19:31] <fraxture> does anyone know if it is possible to use colorbox to create a gallery of videos?  i know it can be done with images, but i can't seem to do it with (youtube) videos.
[04:20:00] <alexander_> no, it is executed immediately.
[04:20:29] <largehardoncolli> thank you
[05:14:39] <sanova> hi

[06:13:31] <matt__> tho sis in the return of an ajax call, how do I access the "Art River Meads bit"…… the closest i am so far is response.owner_address_line
[06:15:01] <matt__> ah did it
[06:29:32] <Xander> Hi. Is it possible to grab the value of a selectbox that was loaded via 'load()'? (example: $('#something').load('some_url'); // in some_url there's <select id="bla">..: $('#bla').val();)?
[06:39:42] <Xander> Sorry, got it figured out. I made some mistakes in the load()'d file. Have a nice day.
[06:43:13] <sunbeam> any good alternatives to lightbox?
[06:43:31] <sunbeam> for a simple site containing x amount (10+) of thumbnails, when thumbnail is clicked show big image
[07:03:36] <ScottG> Could someone explain to me why the inner content isn't showing? http://jsfiddle.net/GP8ws/18/
[07:05:11] <timini> I i add a click event how can i pass variables to in and still access the event object? .click(function(event, var1){event.preventDefault(); console.log(var1);});
[07:06:51] <Haprog> ScottG: you mean the first class content?
[07:06:56] <Haprog> ScottG: because you hide the parent
[07:07:09] <ScottG> Haprog: So how do I get the child to override the hiding of the parent?
[07:07:23] <Haprog> you can't
[07:07:30] <ScottG> Oh...hm.
[07:07:34] <Haprog> unless you use absolute positioning, then maybe..
[07:07:36] <Haprog> I'm not sure
[07:08:33] <ScottG> Haprog: How do I set broad "defaults" for elements and then be able to change specific ones later?
[07:09:03] <Haprog> be more specific
[07:09:19] <Haprog> what defaults?
[07:09:34] <Haprog> are you talking about CSS or what?
[07:10:10] <ScottG> Haprog: Well dynamic pages are going to hide a lot of content up front so it can show it later when the user invokes something.
[07:10:33] <Haprog> so? what is the problem?
[07:10:42] <ScottG> So I want to be able to hide all that content when the page loads but then show specific parts of it later when the user calls it to be shown.
[07:10:51] <ScottG> Haprog: The problem is I don't know how to do this lol
[07:11:48] <Haprog> if you hide an element you hide everything in that element and there's no way around that. you just need to design a suitable HTML structure and hide/show whatever you want.
[07:12:33] <ScottG> Haprog: As a more general question, is this the proper way to show dynamic content to the user?
[07:13:06] <Haprog> and it might not be a good idea to load a lot of stuff on first pageload only to maybe show it later. would usually be better to load the missing content only when it's needed.
[07:13:12] <timini> hello?
[07:13:14] <timini> hello?
[07:13:15] <timini> I i add a click event how can i pass variables to in and still access the event object? .click(function(event, var1){event.preventDefault(); console.log(var1);});
[07:13:26] <ScottG> timini: Don't do that.
[07:14:08] <Haprog> ScottG: there are many ways to do things. might depend on your specific case what is the best method.
[07:14:12] <timini> how can i access the var1 from inside the click event then?
[07:14:35] <ScottG> Haprog: In certain cases I completely agree. I think a nav menu's content is something fine to be loaded up front, though.
[07:14:55] <ScottG> It's very little data and I shouldn't expect the user to have to wait for it.
[07:15:28] <Haprog> that's all good
[07:15:45] <ScottG> Haprog: I'm just pretty new to js/jquery and I'm finding it hard to see the best method to show dynamic content. It all seems very unorganized.
[07:16:06] <Haprog> I'm not a guru either
[07:16:14] <Haprog> but I gotta go now. ->
[07:16:29] <ScottG> ok, thanks for the help
[07:21:40] <sunbeam> any recommendable lightbox or lightbox a like plugin? for a simple site containing x amount (10+) of thumbnails, when thumbnail is clicked show big image
[07:23:23] <rohanrhu> is there anybody using jqgrid?
[07:23:28] <rohanrhu> i need help
[07:24:10] <rohanrhu> can i set jqgrid form's enctype to 'multipart/form-data'
[07:31:59] <ejo> Why has my Firebug command line (and/or larger command editor area) disappeared from Firebug?  I can now only see and use it if I'm on the Console tab... which prevents me from viewing the Script tab and issuing js commands at the same time :((
[07:32:13] <ejo> I asked in the firebug channel on moznet but the silence in there is very loud
[07:32:33] <ejo> This persists after resetting all F'bug settings, restarting firefox, latest updates, reboots, etc
[07:36:44] <outsmartin> ejo: the fifth button from the left
[07:37:21] <ejo> wow thanks.  I strongly suspected I had just acquired a blind spot like that.
[07:37:56] <ejo> It's too bad right-clicking practically everything and everywhere else in the entire F'bug UI did not lead to any other way to accomplish that... is it really available by that button and that button only?
[07:38:01] <ejo> But anyway I'm happy now, thanks :)
[07:55:34] <aldug> I have a form with 6 different fields.  What is the syntax do I use if I want the jquery function to run with ANY of those 6 fields are modified?
[08:01:54] <ejo> aldug: I would catch it one level higher, in an element that contains those 6 fields.  Like on the form itself, or a fieldset.
[08:04:19] <timini> Is there a method like .find() that returns an element instead of an array?
[08:04:51] <_helpPlz_> use .get()
[08:05:13] <lotus> nono use .don'tGet
[08:05:26] <lotus> wait, what was the question?
[08:05:55] <_helpPlz_> or .first()
[08:06:41] <johnkpaul> .first() doesnt' return an element, it returns a jquery object that contains a single element
[08:06:58] <_helpPlz_> yes
[08:11:56] <aldug> ejo: if I put them all in a <div> will that work?
[08:12:01] <riskyshenanigan> how do you keep a font hover color after removing the mouse from it ?
[08:12:20] <riskyshenanigan> like in a menu item that has a submenu
[08:34:23] <aldug> what is the easiest way to bind an event where the user changes text in an input field, but does not click away with the mouse?
[08:34:34] <aldug> like is used in google suggest?
[08:37:10] <_helpPlz_> http://api.jquery.com/keyup/?
[08:37:12] <_helpPlz_> http://api.jquery.com/keyup/ ?
[08:37:34] <ScottG> yup, keyup is great
[08:43:17] <aldug> that's exactly what I was looking for.  One other question, what is the way to properly escape jquery selectors when used inside of .load?
[08:43:45] <aldug> $("#preview").load("/some_php_file.php?foo=$("#some_selector").val()");
[08:43:51] <aldug> that doesn't work
[08:46:11] <ENQ> aldug, read again what you writted, and think what you need :)
[08:46:28] <ENQ> i think + sign is missing isnt it? :)
[08:46:52] <_helpPlz_> $("#preview").load("/some_php_file.php?foo=" + $("#some_selector").val());

[09:36:45] <_helpPlz_> .val(newText) => set Value
[09:36:58] <_helpPlz_> to compare use .val() === text
[09:42:18] <_helpPlz_> black_warlock, working now?

[10:05:50] <hlve> hey guys, I'm trying to take this a href element, and create an image thumbnail on each href with a specific class.
[10:06:01] <hlve> for example, I want to take:
[10:06:02] <hlve> <a href="http://www.domain.com/Image.JPG" class="media-preview">Image Here</a>
[10:06:19] <hlve> and replace 'Image Here' with an img src, with the href from the image.
[10:06:22] <hlve> er, from the href.
[10:06:24] <hlve> Possible?
[10:06:25] <Carlitta87> can sumone remind me the command to enter password n stuff?
[10:06:36] <Carlitta87> is it nickserv sumthing?
[10:06:39] <hlve> (Carlitta87): /authserv auth
[10:06:43] <hlve> er
[10:06:55] <hlve> might be nickserv lol
[10:06:59] <hlve> authserv is on another network
[10:07:01] <QueueQueue> @hlve, you can. however, are you wanting to do this dynamically for all the images on that page or explicitly for one / each element?
[10:07:44] <hlve> well it's a greasemonkey script, i'm replacing all a hrefs in a post with links iwth a thumbnail of the image.
[10:07:52] <hlve> if that makes any sense :3
[10:08:56] <QueueQueue> So are you trying to grab the href of the parent a tag and dynamically populate it as a thumbnail within the a tag ?
[10:09:18] <hlve> yes, it's kinda hacky but that's my goal
[10:11:26] <Carlitta87>  /nickserv IDENTIFY muycal@87
[10:11:30] <hlve> :/
[10:11:33] <Carlitta87> lmao
[10:11:44] <Carlitta87> great
[10:11:45] <wookiehangover> Carlitta87: might be time to change that
[10:11:49] <hlve> lol
[10:12:15] <wookiehangover> I can vouch for myself and the other 800 people in here that we'll keep your password secret
[10:12:55] <hlve> (QueueQueue): http://jsfiddle.net/AvXXx/
[10:13:16] <QueueQueue> Let me try something. Want to test it first
[10:13:22] <hlve> Alright :P
[10:13:26] <hlve> thanks
[10:19:36] <amiit> hello
[10:20:00] <hlve> Hi.
[10:20:16] <amiit> is any body here who can solve my  problrm related to jquery?
[10:20:30] <QueueQueue> @hlve, sorry, seem to be disconnecting.. Did you see the solution I pasted?
[10:20:41] <hlve> I didn't :S
[10:20:51] <QueueQueue> This is assuming you will have image tags within the a tags
[10:20:53] <QueueQueue> $('.comment-content-output > a').each(function(){
[10:20:54] <QueueQueue> 		$('img', this).attr('src', $(this).attr('href'));
[10:20:56] <QueueQueue> 	});
[10:21:12] <QueueQueue> However, if you want, you can create the image tags and drop them each a tag within that function
[10:21:21] <QueueQueue> *drop them in
[10:21:27] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/AvXXx/1/
[10:22:00] <QueueQueue> Yeah, you don't have image tags within the A tags
[10:22:07] <hlve> Ah that's right :P
[10:22:14] <amiit> I want to embed yoxview photo viewer into the verite timeline.Can any body help me out with this?
[10:23:18] <QueueQueue> So what you can do is either put the empty image tags within the html with a class that sizes them appropriately height and width wise... Or dynamically create the image tags as a child to the A tag and add that class
[10:23:34] <QueueQueue> Which is probably more ideal, that way you don't have to keep putting blank image tags in for each image.
[10:23:56] <QueueQueue> That make sense?
[10:25:06] <hlve> It does, thanks for the help :>
[10:25:27] <amiit> I want to embed yoxview photo viewer into the verite timeline.Can any body help me out with this?
[10:26:43] <_helpPlz_> var veriteTimeLine = { yoxviewPhotoViewer: "hahaha"} ;
[10:27:34] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/AvXXx/2/
[10:28:00] <QueueQueue> Sorry, dc'd again.... Not sure why irc keeps doing that ;(
[10:28:04] <hlve> ;(
[10:28:08] <hlve> IRC hates me today.
[10:28:13] <QueueQueue> So is that what you wanted?
[10:28:22] <hlve> Ended up taking yours and adding in this: http://jsfiddle.net/AvXXx/2/
[10:28:26] <hlve> Works great, :>
[10:28:28] <hlve> Thanks for the help.
[10:29:34] <amiit> Dude I am really not in a mood of having fun out here
[10:29:53] <QueueQueue> @hlve, no problem.
[10:31:13] <nFFF> hlve why not simply http://jsfiddle.net/AvXXx/3/
[10:31:13] <nFFF> ?

[10:33:01] <Carlitta87> asking a question in css for like 2 hrs now...no one ever seems to be in there... :/
[10:33:22] <FNTom> What is it?
[10:33:58] <crimson_geek> my table is pushing over my container n i wud like to make it fit : http://neighboursrealty.com.jm/nmcms.php?snippet=agents&p=agentlists
[10:34:29] <FNTom> The email address text?
[10:34:39] <crimson_geek> yup
[10:35:03] <crimson_geek> i did white-space on it n nothing
[10:41:50] <FNTom> I'm not really sure it's easily possible crimson_geek, are you able to wrap it server side via your template / language?
[10:42:36] <crimson_geek> FNTom: no i wasnt
[10:43:21] <FNTom> What langauge do you use?
[10:44:02] <crimson_geek> php
[10:44:37] <FNTom> Ok, so echo wordwrap($email, 25, '<br />', true);
[10:45:05] <FNTom> Instead of echo $email, it's a nasty way to fix the problem. However I believe that most new CSS rules for forcing text to wrap do not work with tables.
[10:47:03] <shoky> crimson_geek: which table
[10:47:51] <crimson_geek> FNTom: got it to break...seems like it was the only way to do it :/
[10:48:15] <crimson_geek> shoky: a pesky table wudnt wrap the text
[10:48:21] <crimson_geek> most annoying thing ever
[10:48:26] <shoky> iz ok nao?
[10:48:38] <crimson_geek> shoky: yeh its ok
[10:48:46] <FNTom> crimson_geek: If you're able to re-do it, doing it with inline divs or lists would make it easier. But I understand there's time involved in doing so.
[10:49:16] <crimson_geek> yup :/ ...thanks guys, truly appreciate it :)
[10:56:19] <Kaltiz> If I do a $('body').append
[10:56:45] <Kaltiz> Can I use $('body:last-child') to select that element I just added?
[10:57:29] <Kaltiz> derp is has to be $('body img:last-child') doesn't it?
[10:57:46] <johnkpaul> Kaltiz: derp?
[10:58:03] <johnkpaul> that will work, but it would probably be better to save querying the dom, and store what you just appended
[10:58:29] <Kaltiz> I am constantly adding and removing elements tho?
[10:58:29] <johnkpaul> or something like $newElement.appendTo('body').whateverJqueryMethodYouwWantHere
[10:59:18] <johnkpaul> Kaltiz: if you want to know the current last child, you can use that selector, but if you just appended to body, why query again?
[10:59:19] <Kaltiz> That is probably a better way, thanks
[10:59:26] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun
[10:59:43] <Kaltiz> is $newElement just a variable name or?
[11:00:00] <Kaltiz> also, how would I tell it what to append like that?
[11:00:01] <johnkpaul> yes, just a variable name, whatever you would have passed to body.append
[11:00:33] <johnkpaul> $('body').append("what was goingt o go here, Kaltiz?")
[11:00:41] <Kaltiz> Yes
[11:01:08] <johnkpaul> I'm asking, what was going to go there?
[11:01:22] <johnkpaul> if it was an html string, then you'll need to wrap it with $ to use .appendTo
[11:01:30] <johnkpaul> if it's a jquery object already, it will have appendTo
[11:01:50] <Kaltiz> It was a html string,
[11:02:30] <timini> How can i prevent a checkbox changing when i click it?
[11:02:33] <johnkpaul> ok, then just wrap it, and call .appendTo('body')
[11:02:40] <johnkpaul> ?preventDefault @timini
[11:02:41] <bot-t> timini, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:03:41] <Kaltiz> So like $('<img src="test" />").appendTo('body') ?
[11:03:42] <aZnmAn> Anyone in here familiar with Kendo UI?
[11:03:49] <imsky> lada deee
[11:04:57] <johnkpaul> ?tias @Kaltiz
[11:04:57] <bot-t> Kaltiz, Try It And See
[11:05:31] <Vooloo> can you design the jquery modal window however you like? using themeroller you can just change colors
[11:09:37] <timini> Strangly I can't preventDefault() on this checkbox http://jsfiddle.net/CzfU8/
[11:11:35] <johnkpaul> timini: works fine for me in chrome 19
[11:11:52] <johnkpaul> and ff13 osx

[11:16:27] <fr00d> Hello
[11:17:08] <fr00d> I'm trying to get my links <a href=""> work with jquery mobile. Can somebody tell me what I need to do that normal HTML links are working as expected?
[11:17:32] <Kaltiz> Is there an easy way to flip an image using jquery?
[11:17:45] <johnkpaul> fr00d: you need to add some extra attribute in jqmobile
[11:17:48] <johnkpaul> but I don't remember what it is
[11:18:00] <johnkpaul> Kaltiz: no, look into css transormations
[11:18:18] <johnkpaul> fr00d: rel="external"
[11:18:24] <fr00d> johnkpaul: Could you give me some keyword that might help me searching for a solution to this problem? How do I set these extry attributes?
[11:18:36] <fr00d> It is no external link. ;)
[11:18:37] <johnkpaul> fr00d: I just googled for jquery mobile link docuemntation
[11:18:39] <johnkpaul> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/docs/pages/link-formats.html
[11:18:51] <johnkpaul> oh, what do you mean "working as expected"?
[11:18:59] <johnkpaul> links in jqery mobile do lots of magical things
[11:19:06] <johnkpaul> that page will give you more information
[11:20:05] <fr00d> What I expect is that my <a href="/foo/bar"> link is working as I do not have jquery mobile enabled.
[11:20:41] <johnkpaul> fr00d: did you try rel external?
[11:20:45] <johnkpaul> or data-ajax false?
[11:21:01] <johnkpaul> one of the options in the docs should map to what you intend to happen when you click on a link
[11:21:47] <fr00d> woohoo, magic, thank you johnkpaul. data-ajax="false" does the job.
[11:22:07] <johnkpaul> :) great, you're welcome, have fun
[11:26:00] <fr00d> johnkpaul: thanks ;)
[11:38:17] <Kaltiz> How do I check if the up arrow is pushed?
[11:39:01] <sanova> i'm trying to use $.manageAjax plugin.. it correctly execs ajax requests, but i can not abort or clear them when i need to do that..
[11:41:52] <sanova> i create a "MenagedAjax" with specific name and call it adding new request with method add. it works but it doesn't remove requests using $.manageAjax('MenageAjax', true)
[11:42:40] <sanova> what can be wrong?
[11:48:49] <styol> Kaltiz: the up arrow on the keyboard? when it is pressed anywhere on the page, a specific input, or otherwise?
[11:49:03] <Kaltiz> Anywhere on the page
[11:50:18] <sanova> i'm sorry it works.. i call $.manageAjax in another js file and it can not recognize it. i have to put it in a global variable
[11:59:27] <styol> Kaltiz: check out keypress, keydown, and keyup (probably want keyup).. example implementation for anywhere on the page might be something like $(window).keyup(function(){}); but not entirely sure, guessing
[12:03:52] <styol> Kaltiz: $(window).keyup(function(event){ if (event.which == 38) { /* do something on up arrow keyup */ } });

[13:28:24] <johnkpaul> oh, sure, that would work

[13:46:30] <Whirl3d_> Hello #jquery
[13:46:43] <Koganei> hola
[13:47:52] <imsky> holla!
[13:48:36] <Whirl3d_> so, I'm trying out Trillian's irc plugin and it looks pretty nice actually
[14:11:18] <Whirl3d_> Can someone explain when I would use the "new" keyword when calling a function...like var item=new function ()    or var item=function()
[14:11:44] <Koganei> never?
[14:12:00] <Whirl3d_> not true.
[14:12:12] <Koganei> what's the diff
[14:12:18] <Koganei> I thought var item = function() implied new
[14:12:23] <Whirl3d_> that's my question
[14:12:32] <Whirl3d_> I don't think so.
[14:12:35] <timini> I added overlay() to an element, does anyone know a way to remove the event listener? I tried off but looks like it dosn't set it.
[14:12:49] <Koganei> http://tadhg.com/wp/2006/12/12/using-new-function-in-javascript/
[14:13:01] <Whirl3d_> I think that one evaluates the function and returns the value, while the other returns an object with methods and such
[14:15:51] <Whirl3d_> http://sparecycles.wordpress.com/2008/06/29/advanced-javascript/
[14:16:02] <Koganei> "The key is that the function is passed to the constructor as a string, so you can write in variables to be evaluated later simply as part of the string, while you can set the value of the variables to be evaluated at write time by referencing them directly. "
[14:16:06] <Koganei> ^ Whirl3d_
[14:17:28] <Whirl3d_> Koganei, thanks for the replies.
[14:17:35] <Koganei> np, did it help
[14:18:09] <Whirl3d_> I am writing a function that I need to have return a copy of itself as an object...is that possible?
[14:18:35] <Koganei> return 'this'?
[14:18:37] <Koganei> or
[14:18:38] <Koganei> err
[14:18:41] <Whirl3d_> In other words, when you call the function, it returns a function with similar methods attached in object form.
[14:18:42] <Koganei> return this
[14:18:47] <Koganei> oh
[14:19:03] <Whirl3d_> you know, like promise does for deferreds
[14:19:17] <Koganei> I don't know what that means
[14:19:44] <Whirl3d_> when you return a promise, it returns an object that has some of the deferred methods (done, fail, always)  but not all of them (like resolve, reject)
[14:20:03] <Whirl3d_> so often, a deferred or a promise can be used interchangeably.
[14:20:34] <Koganei> I haven't come accross deferred and promise in jquery yet, reading about it now
[14:20:56] <Koganei> can you check the source for promise and deferred and see how it's done?
[14:21:13] <Whirl3d_> They are pretty cool, actually. I am trying to extend the $.Callbacks() object...
[14:21:58] <Whirl3d_> I will do that, but I usually get completely lost when trying to decipher it. They use a lot of "black magic" coding techniques that I still don't have a good working library of yet.
[14:23:37] <Koganei> you could... mak a function that checks all the inner functions of a function passed as an argument and makes a new object, gives those inner functions as methods and return that
[14:23:52] <Koganei> I think that last sentence made sense
[14:24:06] <Whirl3d_> lol. but can you say it 3 times fast. LOL
[14:24:12] <Koganei> :)
[14:24:46] <Whirl3d_> how would you check the inner functions of a function
[14:28:04] <Koganei> hm let me think
[14:29:31] <Koganei> you could have a headache doing it with .toString, but it's possible I suppose
[14:29:52] <Koganei> toString and regex
[14:33:31] <Whirl3d_> here's where I am heading with all this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/eLAqf/1/
[14:33:43] * Koganei clicks
[14:37:38] <Koganei> :o Whirl3d_: I'll check it out later actually, I gtg~ tell me if it works out
[14:37:39] <Koganei> later
[14:37:55] <sunbeam> http://i50.tinypic.com/29z9d3d.gif
[14:37:56] <Whirl3d_> thanks. ttyl
[14:38:02] <sunbeam> Anyone might know what fonr this is?
[14:39:59] <Whirl3d_> Arial Bold? Maybe PT Sans Bold or Segoe UI bold
[14:40:33] <sunbeam> I tried what the font, but it only gave me non correct fonts
[14:40:36] <sunbeam> lets see Whirl3d_
[14:40:52] <karolyi_> hi, i'm getting strange jQuery errors when using eval'ed scripts from the memory
[14:42:42] <sunbeam> Whirl3d_: negative for both
[14:43:12] <Whirl3d_> where'd you get it from? perhaps the css has clues
[14:49:16] <karolyi> ther shouldn't be any difference between script tag'ed scripts and dynamically eval'ed scripts, huh?
[14:50:00] <karolyi> +e
[14:50:45] <karolyi> it seems there is, especially when using chrome, but i get sometimes errors with firefox, too
[14:50:48] <Whirl3d_> karolyi, if you posted some code to jsfiddle.net, it'd be a lot easier to help. Otherise, it's a crapshoot
[14:51:19] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: actually, i can only show it on the development site, because thee's a lot of code
[14:51:27] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: http://test.hondaforum.hu/
[14:53:11] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: i just don't know what i'm doing wrong, sometimes i get a jquery error, sometimes it just runs smoothly
[14:55:47] <Whirl3d_> where is the part of your code that resizes the background.
[14:56:08] <Whirl3d_> Roughly it sounds as though you are trying to resize the forum based on the loaded image that sometimes isn't loaded
[14:56:29] <Whirl3d_> so when it's loaded, you should be able to get the origWidth value...but if it's not...it errors
[14:56:51] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: http://test.hondaforum.hu/js/widget/backgroundChanger.js
[14:58:00] <karolyi> the image changer works at me just fine... i've an error when the topic comntents is filled up
[14:59:19] <Whirl3d_> here's one thing you should check
[15:00:01] <Whirl3d_> when setting up an image loader like the one you linked to, you need to check the complete property of the html image element and manually fire the success handler if it's true;
[15:01:05] <Whirl3d_> so right after prelaoder.src=imageSrc;   put:  if (preloader.complete) {preloader.load();}
[15:01:47] <Whirl3d_> this resolves the issue when the image is cached. Sometimes it never fires the loadSuccess handler because it is already loaded.
[15:02:37] <Whirl3d_> the only error I saw was "cannot read property origHeight of undefined
[15:02:50] <karolyi> which browser are you using?
[15:02:54] <Whirl3d_> chrome
[15:03:49] <Whirl3d_> doesn't happen in FF, I noticed
[15:04:02] <karolyi> chrome 19.0.1084.56 here
[15:04:05] <karolyi> on a mac
[15:04:31] <karolyi> and the image changer works by me ... but i'll look after this problem
[15:04:50] <Whirl3d_> windows here...20.0.1132.34 beta-m
[15:05:15] <Whirl3d_> how do I fill up the topic contents?
[15:05:37] <karolyi> wait, i'll fix this, after that, you might see the real problem
[15:06:15] <Whirl3d_> I should see it in FF, right?
[15:06:22] <Vooloo> can you design the jquery modal window however you like? using themeroller you can just change colors
[15:06:53] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: sometimes it comes with FF too, but like 6 of 10 times in chrome
[15:07:55] <novochar> i'm not sure why http post requests are automatically directed to /update on sites
[15:07:56] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: okay, i've put your suggestion in, now it should work as you say
[15:09:18] <Whirl3d_> karolyi, now I get cannot call method 'apply' of undefined...
[15:10:38] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: yes, that's it
[15:11:10] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: this is just mystical, when i load the scripts (models, controllers, widgets) in script tags, it just executes fine
[15:11:35] <Whirl3d_> can you change your for statement to read something like for (; list && firingIndex<firingLength &&list[firingIndex], firingIndex++)  {
[15:12:05] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: where exactly?
[15:13:40] <Whirl3d_> sorry, that's in the jQuery core. You are providing a callback function somewhere that jquery can't resolve
[15:14:13] <karolyi> callback? i'm using a lot of deferred objects with when-then statements
[15:14:41] <karolyi> in the app.js, you can find the codeLoader, which is also a deferred script loader
[15:15:05] <Whirl3d_> the odd thing is that in my debugger, I see links to the code that calls each line except next to the onces in forum.widget.toicGroup....
[15:15:15] <bencahill> Hey guys, I need to have a gallery controllable by the keyboard and so that I can click and hold on (and drag around) the picture and it will display a portion of a larger picture.
[15:15:50] <bencahill> Galleriffic looks good, but I don't know if it would be possible to implement the latter with it...and it doesn't have a carousel, which is really what I'd rather (than paging)
[15:18:12] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: i experienced with changing the code here and there, but no success, it seems as something seems to be going out of my control when using eval'ed scripts
[15:18:43] <karolyi> however, it runs fine when i uncomment the commented script tags in the header
[15:18:45] <Whirl3d_> not sure what you mean by eval'ed scripts
[15:20:56] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: for example, when i need a widget, i load up the script in a string, and then i run a window['eval'].call(window, scripttext) on it, so i must not make a script tag for it, and that way i am able to load scripts later when i really need them (which makes the site faster, lazy loading)
[15:21:54] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: look at the Forum.codeLoader in http://test.hondaforum.hu/js/app.js
[15:22:30] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: thatswhy you see the strange backtrace in the debugger
[15:23:01] <karolyi> ... because the script is actually in the memory loaded from a string
[15:24:13] <Whirl3d_> karloyi, while I applaud the idea...it's way out of my reach. You need an expert to help you with that. I wish I could help, but that is going to involve some intimate knowledge of either script loaders or more generally, how jquery handles the conversion of strings to scripts...or maybe something I don't even know to not know...lol
[15:25:15] <karolyi> Whirl3d_: well, thanks... do you know anyone who could be helpful with my issue here?
[15:31:12] <Whirl3d_> Well, there are the big-hitters on here, but I haven't seen them today:   folks like _shoky_ and _Eviltwin_, and _systemFault_, and so many others that are really good and really generous... I put the _ around their names, hoping not to disturb them in case they get pinged...but I would look for those names. If I think of others that I have seen online today, I'll let you know.
[15:31:51] <Eviltwin> Didn't work
[15:32:03] <karolyi> meheh
[15:32:09] <Eviltwin> You gotta actually break up the name
[15:32:33] <karolyi> Eviltwin: while you're here, do you have time and are you in the mood to look up my problem ?
[15:32:39] <Whirl3d_> next time I will do. Sorry to bother you.
[15:33:08] <Eviltwin> karolyi: Depends on the problem
[15:35:07] <karolyi> Eviltwin: i'm started up with a project of mine, a single-paged webapplication, and i'm using eval'ed scripts which are loaded up from strings. I get strange error when loading up my site, and it seems i'm not wrong, or there's isomething which is out of my reach
[15:35:22] <zitter|mobile> anyone recognize which jquery plugin are those slideset? http://www.yootheme.com/widgetkit/examples/slideset I've asked some days ago, but someone told me it is nivo slider... is it possible?
[15:35:35] <karolyi> Eviltwin: if you load up http://test.hondaforum.hu/ with chrome, you'll see the error
[15:35:39] <Eviltwin> Why are you using evals?
[15:35:44] <Eviltwin> Evals are considered a bad practice
[15:37:04] <karolyi> Eviltwin: even when coming from a trusted source?
[15:37:13] <karolyi> in this case, my site
[15:37:59] <karolyi> Eviltwin: i actually wanted to dodge putting in shitloads of script tags in the dom, when using lazy loading
[15:38:00] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:38:19] <Eviltwin> It's because eval causes the state of the program to change in unpredictable ways
[15:38:23] <Eviltwin> Both causing things to be slower
[15:38:32] <Eviltwin> And also leading to really bizarre, unexpected, and hard-to-trace problems
[15:38:43] <karolyi> yup, thats what i have now
[15:39:15] <karolyi> i thought, browsers have come so far, that we can use eval'ed code
[15:39:49] <Eviltwin> Uh
[15:40:00] <karolyi> but then there's yepnope, i could make use of those library, but it uses script tags injecting
[15:40:15] <Eviltwin> Scrip tag injection is still better than eval
[15:40:54] <karolyi> sad to hear that... i worked out my own caching system for my app, now i have to rework it
[15:41:24] <Eviltwin> Right now the site's loading fine about half the time and the other half it's throwing about three different exceptions at different places
[15:41:34] <Eviltwin> Indicating more than one race condition
[15:42:04] <Eviltwin> Unfortunately I don't think I'm going to be able to help you with this
[15:42:23] <Eviltwin> There's just way too much going on for me to trace through quickly
[15:42:34] <karolyi> i thought that this is something way to deep
[15:42:37] <karolyi> *too
[15:43:10] <karolyi> actually i tried fiddling with the code, no help at al, it seems just getting out of my hands
[15:44:32] <karolyi> Eviltwin: when i use script tags (commented out now in the header), it just works... this phenomenon is only with the eval'ed code
[15:45:09] <Eviltwin> eval can introduce new variables or overwrite existing ones in your scopes
[15:45:09] <caniuse> Eviltwin: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier'
[15:45:27] <Eviltwin> caniuse: You should probably put an expected one there
[15:45:57] <Eviltwin> karolyi: New script tags run in global scope so they can't futz with your internal scope
[15:46:57] <karolyi> Eviltwin: i run the code evaluation in the window scope, which i learnd from the jquery source: window['eval'].call(window, scripttext)
[15:48:33] <karolyi> Eviltwin: and all my code is written in noconflict mode
[15:48:50] <Eviltwin> I'm still not clear as to why you need to explicitly eval anything
[15:49:14] <Eviltwin> As opposed to just adding new script resources as <script> tags with srcs to your scripts
[15:49:54] <karolyi> Eviltwin: to use my caching of codes, i cache the source in the local storage with a cache key, and when that cache key is changed, the local storage is erased, and all scripts are loaded again, when they are needed
[15:50:16] <karolyi> Eviltwin: this makes the app loading faster, where local storage is available
[15:50:18] <Eviltwin> You do know that in this modern age, browsers know how to cache, right?
[15:50:34] <Eviltwin> I highly doubt that.
[15:53:24] <karolyi> Eviltwin: if i code a lot (which i'll do, this application will get huge, and still remain single-paged), putting everything in script tags will cause tremendous loading times
[15:53:55] <Eviltwin> karolyi: You don't put everything in the HTML
[15:54:04] <Eviltwin> You dynamically add script tags via JavaScript
[15:54:23] <karolyi> that's the recommended way?
[15:55:23] <Eviltwin> karolyi: https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=389414033919
[15:57:21] <karolyi> brb reading:)
[15:59:59] <timini> If i want to swat the listener on an element from one function to another how would I do this?
[16:00:42] <Eviltwin> timini: Explain further
[16:01:23] <timini> I want to change the click handler from one function to another
[16:01:44] <Eviltwin> So you're saying you have a click handler that you want to remove and then attach another click handler?
[16:02:12] <timini> yep
[16:02:22] <egukin> Hello everyone. Got a lagging problem on scroll, occurring in webkit browsers. http://jsfiddle.net/Db5DT/
[16:02:35] <Eviltwin> So you can .off('click', theCurrentFunction).on('click', theNewFunction)
[16:02:36] <egukin> I’m trying to implement a simple table with “fixed headers”
[16:02:52] <Eviltwin> Or if you want to remove all current click listeners, .off('click')
[16:03:11] <egukin> this works fine in Firefox, but lags in Chrome and Safari. Slightly better in Canary, but no much
[16:03:20] <Eviltwin> egukin: Why not use position: fixed?
[16:03:40] <egukin> position:fixed fixes the element relatively to the whole document
[16:03:52] <egukin> I need the headers to be fixed within the table area
[16:05:10] <Eviltwin> egukin: http://www.imaputz.com/cssStuff/bigFourVersion.html
[16:05:40] <egukin> Eviltwin: you can see the problem with such solutions, on OSX Lion
[16:05:59] <egukin> they don't account for disappearing scrollabars, so the table right now appears messed up to me
[16:06:28] <egukin> http://cl.ly/392L1O1o1d3i0W361o0p
[16:06:58] <Whirl3d_> Eviltwin, so if I say var item=new customFunc();    I get a new object with prototype="customFunc"?  so I could validate item with: var isCustom=item.prototype=customFunc;   is that correct?
[16:07:20] <Whirl3d_> *==
[16:09:41] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: item.constructor
[16:10:03] <Whirl3d_> rockin' thanks.
[16:10:11] <Eviltwin> But better is item instanceof customFunc
[16:10:34] <Eviltwin> Because it accounts for inheritence
[16:10:43] <Eviltwin> inheritance*
[16:11:31] <Whirl3d_> so, var isJquery=item.jQuery  or itm instanceof jQuery?
[16:14:54] <karolyi> Eviltwin: well, i somehow am doing the same with my project, using a lot of deferred loading
[16:16:24] <karolyi> Eviltwin: everything worked fine, until i switched back the eval'ed loading from test mode, but well, i'll change my ways
[16:17:32] <karolyi> btw the project is opensource: https://github.com/karolyi/Forum
[16:20:08] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: You're trying t otest if something is jQuery?
[16:20:34] <Whirl3d_> Actually, in that last case, yes. before it was a custom function
[16:20:47] <Whirl3d_> if it's a jquery object
[16:20:52] <Whirl3d_> rather than a dom node
[16:20:57] <Whirl3d_> or a custom object
[16:21:49] <Eviltwin> What use case?
[16:22:44] <Whirl3d_> function doSomething (elem, data) { if (!elem.jQuery) {elem=$(elem); }; do stuff with the jquery object elem}
[16:23:36] <Eviltwin> You know that $(jQueryObject) works just fine, right?
[16:24:33] <Whirl3d_> I thought it was bad form. Like in a plugin, you don't wrap "this" in jquery becfause it is jquery...
[16:25:00] <Eviltwin> That's because you know with certainty it's going to be a jQuery object
[16:25:35] <Eviltwin> Assuming people don't do something stupid
[16:27:14] <Whirl3d_> can you explain why folks frown on declaring methods of an object in the object function...They prefer extending the prototype?
[16:28:02] <Eviltwin> You mean function A() { this.foo = function() { ... } } vs function A() {} A.prototype.foo = function() { ... }; ?
[16:29:23] <Whirl3d_> yeah. I had a hard time articulating that
[16:30:06] <Eviltwin> So in the first case
[16:30:17] <Eviltwin> A new function is constructed each time
[16:30:22] <Eviltwin> And assigned to the foo property of the object
[16:30:40] <karolyi> anyway, thanks for the help
[16:30:45] <karolyi> i'll get along from here
[16:30:49] <Eviltwin> In the second example, the object is constructed once and is automatically treated as a method of new instances of A
[16:30:58] <Eviltwin> Without having to be constructed or copied
[16:31:06] <Whirl3d_> Got It! Finally!
[16:31:17] <Eviltwin> So the answer is: It's faster
[16:31:38] <Whirl3d_> You really need to write a book. That's such a perfect explanation...I have been looking and looking and couldn't find a direct answer. Thanks
[16:47:11] <timini> Is there a way to prevent to the onLoad event from the onBeforeLoad one?
[17:37:27] <Colonel_Panic> Hey all
[17:38:14] <Colonel_Panic> I'm using the JQuery UI on a very complex set of web pages, and there appears to be an issue with some scripts conflicting with one another
[17:39:11] <Colonel_Panic> One of the things I need to do is have multiple tab sets to swap out divs, with a couple of the sets nested within a higher-level set
[17:39:26] <Colonel_Panic> for some reason, the tabs don't want to wqork at all
[17:43:25] <Whirl3d_> lookup jquery.noConflict();
[17:44:06] <JonYoder> I have a question about selectors. I'm trying to do this:
[17:44:08] <JonYoder> $j("body:not(.home) + #content").animate...
[17:44:34] <JonYoder> I want #content to be selected only if body doesn't have the class .home
[17:45:20] <Whirl3d_> $("body:not(".home")).find("#content").animate(  ?
[17:45:24] <Whirl3d_> maybe
[17:45:33] <Colonel_Panic> on my page, I have dialog boxes, I'm using tablesorter and tablescroll to make tables that can scroll and be sorted by column
[17:45:35] <Eviltwin> #content:not(.home)
[17:45:44] <Eviltwin> Oh
[17:45:46] <Eviltwin> Wait
[17:45:49] <Eviltwin> First
[17:46:08] <Whirl3d_> $("body:not('home')").find("#content"); maybe..
[17:46:27] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/next-adjacent-Selector/
[17:46:41] <Eviltwin> Is that really the selector you want?
[17:47:38] <Whirl3d_> $("#content").filter(function () {return $(this).closest(".home").length>0;});
[17:48:25] <JonYoder> Eviltwin: you're right, + was the wrong selector, I was just trying different things and was last on that.
[17:48:25] <Whirl3d_> actually, <=0 if you don't want it to select when body has class home
[17:48:58] <JonYoder> Whirl3d_: how would this be used if I wanted to add .css or .animate?
[17:49:23] <Whirl3d_> I guess you would cache the selection and then apply the css or animate.
[17:49:31] <Krinkle> Anyone an idea why the > selector isn't working in the on() selector ?
[17:49:32] <Krinkle> http://jsfiddle.net/pUh3F/
[17:50:12] <Whirl3d_> var contentNotHome=$("#content").closest("body.home").length?null:$("#content");
[17:51:01] <Whirl3d_> if (contentNotHome) contentNotHome.doStuff
[17:51:50] <rashire> ok stupid question: have a div '<div id="MainContent_ctl00_Console" ...'  and jquery statement, '$("div.MainContent_ctl00_Console").hide('slow');' why does it not disapear
[17:51:51] <bot-t> (286 hours ago) <coldhead> tell rashire i'll never forget you
[17:52:15] <JonYoder> Whirl3d_: ahhh... it works so well! ;-) Thank you!
[17:52:40] <Whirl3d_> yw 8)
[17:53:03] <JonYoder> Now I just have to figure out what all this means so I can do it from scratch. :)
[17:54:16] <Druide_> j
[17:54:31] <Whirl3d_> it reads like a question...   var x equals select the content div, check to see if it is under the body.home element and if it is return null. Otherwise return the content
[17:55:23] <Whirl3d_> since jquery returns an empty object when it can't find something, you have to check the length of the object (which will be 0) to tell if it exists
[17:57:17] <Whirl3d_> its a short way of doing: var content=$("#content"); var homebody=content.closest("home.body"); if (homebody.length>0) {content=null;}
[17:57:45] <JonYoder> Whirl3d_: awesome. Thanks again!
[17:57:50] <Whirl3d_> np
[17:58:44] <Eviltwin> If you're doing $("#content")
[17:59:00] <Eviltwin> You might as well do $(document.body).hasClass("home")
[17:59:04] <Eviltwin> As your test
[17:59:25] <Eviltwin> $(document.body).hasClass("home")?$("#content"):null
[17:59:27] <Eviltwin> Or whatever
[17:59:59] <Whirl3d_> JohnYoder, listen to Eviltwin, his is better for sure
[18:00:02] <JonYoder> How would that be different?
[18:00:06] <JonYoder> okay. ;)
[18:00:47] <Whirl3d_> his is simply: if body has the home class, return the content div, otherwise return null.
[18:00:50] <rashire> ternary statement, run for the hills.
[18:01:30] <Whirl3d_> rashire, try just $("#maincontent_ yadayada);
[18:01:46] <Whirl3d_> ".mainContent" is to select by class, not id
[18:02:16] <rashire> and that did it...
[18:02:31] <rashire> what does the # do anyways i search the documentation for a while with no details
[18:02:44] <Whirl3d_> # is the id selector prefix
[18:02:58] <rashire> so div.x x is class?
[18:02:59] <Eviltwin> rashire: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[18:03:01] <Whirl3d_> $("#something") will return the thing with id="something"
[18:03:37] <Whirl3d_> yeah, "." is the class selector prefix...so $(".classname") will return all elements of class classname
[18:03:55] <rashire> gotcha
[18:03:58] <rashire> thnx
[18:05:33] <Whirl3d_> Eviltwin, do you have any tricks up your sleeve for parsing the parameters of a function easily...I have a function that takes three or four different kinds of paramters. and I have a ton of if statements at the start...any tricks on how to do this kind of thing better?
[18:06:41] <Whirl3d_> like you could pass an array and a function as parameters, or an array no function, a string and function, a string no function,
[18:08:55] <Colonel_Panic> What is required to adapt JUI tabs to have multiple tabs on one page, including having them nested inside another set?
[18:09:07] <Colonel_Panic> Sorry, multiple tab sets
[18:09:41] <Whirl3d_> you just have to call the tabs() constructor multiple times (once for each set);
[18:09:49] <Colonel_Panic> I've initialized the tabsets to specific element IDs
[18:09:55] <Colonel_Panic> instead of the .tabs class
[18:10:03] <Whirl3d_> and...
[18:10:11] <Colonel_Panic> they don't work
[18:10:30] <Colonel_Panic> some of them, when clicked, will switch after a page refresh
[18:10:38] <Whirl3d_> paste your code (html, css, and js) at jsfiddle.net and share the url back here and we could help.
[18:10:43] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[18:11:00] <Colonel_Panic> It might take awhile because there's a lot of code...
[18:11:11] <Whirl3d_> try to make a limited use case
[18:11:19] <Colonel_Panic> thanks, though. I really appreciate the help
[18:11:24] <Whirl3d_> just enough to build your tabs within tabs...
[18:11:29] <Whirl3d_> np
[18:18:08] <JonYoder> Whirl3d_: I must have messed something up... I changed it for body to not be .page instead of not be .home
[18:18:18] <JonYoder> var contentNotPage=$j(document.body).hasClass("page")?$j("page"):null; -- is what I currently have
[18:18:20] <Colonel_Panic> I've uploaded an early version of my page here: https://rapidshare.com/files/3369787437/csr-demo.zip
[18:18:38] <Colonel_Panic> I'm still working on the jsfiddle
[18:21:21] <Whirl3d_> JonYoder, hasClass does not require the "." prefix... but to select by class, you need "." in front of the classname
[18:22:03] <Whirl3d_> $(document.body).hasClass("page")?$(documet.body):null
[18:22:21] <Whirl3d_> since $(".page") is going to be your document body anyways
[18:22:55] <Whirl3d_> but then you could just as easily select for $("body.page");
[18:23:26] <Whirl3d_> in your previous question, you wanted something inside the body only if the body wasn't a particular class...
[18:24:02] <JonYoder> Right. And I still do, but I changed the class that I didn't want.
[18:24:15] <Whirl3d_> read through it, though
[18:24:45] <Whirl3d_> you say:   if document.body has class "page" return the item of class page otherwise return null
[18:25:06] <Whirl3d_> well the item of class page is your document. body cause you just asked if it did
[18:25:35] <Whirl3d_> what you probably want is if document.body has class page return null othewise return content inside document.body
[18:26:24] <Whirl3d_> which would look like $(document.body).hasClass("page")?null:$("#content");
[18:29:10] <procrastubator> Does anyone have any input on why this code is not even recognized by Firebug? http://pastie.org/4105989
[18:29:10] <Whirl3d_> Colonel_panic, no dice. it says document not found...
[18:29:23] <procrastubator> I'm pretty sure JQuery is included, because if I write that code out (instead of having it in the function form you see there) it works fine
[18:30:07] <JonYoder> Whirl3d_: yay! It's working great. Thanks!
[18:30:42] <Whirl3d_> procrastubator what is $(function) {}?
[18:31:36] <procrastubator> Whirl3d_: Do you mean in the mousevent over part or in general?
[18:31:59] <Whirl3d_> $(function) doesn't look correct to me.
[18:32:24] <Whirl3d_> you would have to have defined function (a keyword) to be a dom element
[18:32:59] <procrastubator> Whirl3d_: Which line are you looking at???
[18:33:08] <Whirl3d_> line 25
[18:33:09] <procrastubator> Oh
[18:33:10] <procrastubator> snap
[18:33:12] <procrastubator> huh
[18:33:22] <TomWij> $(function) { }); yields SyntaxError: Unexpected token )
[18:33:46] <TomWij> And it's the first ), not the last one.
[18:33:57] <JonYoder> Whirl3d_: If you want to see the crazy function that you helped me with: http://jonyoder.com/blog (sidebar).find("View images large")
[18:34:02] <TomWij> Because after the keyword function, a ( is expected.
[18:34:47] <TomWij> This one is valid syntax: $(function() {  }); but still doesn't make sense to run that. :D
[18:35:15] <procrastubator> Good catch Whirl3d_ I meant to have a nameless function, the brackets wound up elsewhere. It is getting recognized by Firebug now and I can fix it
[18:35:26] <TomWij> Actually surpsied that $(function() { console.log("hi"); }).call(); works... o_O
[18:38:22] <Whirl3d_> JonYoder, want some feedback?
[18:38:39] <JonYoder> Sure!
[18:39:33] <Whirl3d_> pm me
[19:30:27] <Colonel_Panic> There's too much content here to mess around with JS fiddle. I couldn't even get the page to work in it.
[19:30:46] <Colonel_Panic> Here's the entire damn directory structure: http://www.mediafire.com/?tgq78cctd80cp5g
[19:31:22] <Colonel_Panic> It's a single page, with all the supporting scripts, styles, images and whatnot.
[19:33:30] <Colonel_Panic> I hope somebody here can help, because I've been banging away at this code for over a week now and I just can't seem to figure out where I'm going wrong with these tabs.
[19:34:05] <hlve> Can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/M49Qb/ I'm trying to remove all of the <br>s after any a tags.
[19:34:14] <hlve> (using jquery of course.) ;P
[19:35:55] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/M49Qb/1/ Actually a better example. W/ current jQuery.
[19:36:40] <Colonel_Panic> whenever I try to implement the tabs in JQuery, it breaks every script on the page
[19:38:19] <hlve> Colonel_Panic, have you checked your error console to see where it's breaking?
[19:39:36] <hlve> i'd also suggest you try to isolate the issue and try the code in jsfiddle (jjsfiddle.net) so we can debug the problem together. We don't know what your code even looks like lol
[19:40:07] <Colonel_Panic> I posted it here: http://www.mediafire.com/?tgq78cctd80cp5g
[19:40:25] <hlve> Eh. Like I said, have you checked your error console to see where it's hitting a breakpoint?
[19:41:08] <Colonel_Panic> Hold on, I'm de-commenting the offending code now so I can test it
[19:44:02] <Colonel_Panic> It returns a syntax error at a random line number
[19:45:07] <hlve> that random line number is showing to be your issue, what's on that line?
[19:45:45] <Colonel_Panic> }) --it's closing a function
[19:47:05] <Colonel_Panic> I removed the function and it threw an uncaught exception
[19:48:36] <Colonel_Panic> Mismatching fragment identifier.
[19:48:43] <Colonel_Panic> What does that mean?
[19:48:56] <jfisk87> hey guys, how could i add code to this $message$ property? http://pastebin.com/t8u7q2QQ
[19:49:02] <Colonel_Panic> It says that when I click a tab
[19:49:32] <jfisk87> if i instantiate this widget, and set the t_content myself id have to surround it with those outer divs to get it to display but i know im doing something wrong
[19:53:24] <tinix> Hi all, I have a question in regards to whether I'm going about this the best way. Basically I have a dynamic form that I'm serializing into a JSON object, which will be passed to a backend API. I've got that part working, but now I need to make existing records editable. I figured I should just pass the data back, and have the front-end re-create the forms and populate the values. See here: http://jsfiddle.net/xhKxa/ I'm wondering if there is a better way
[19:56:51] <Colonel_Panic> UGH I just found and fixed 3 errors...
[20:25:01] <tw2113> go you
[20:25:49] <Colonel_Panic> how are these tabs supposed to work, anyway?
[20:27:48] <Colonel_Panic> You define 2 or more divs with some content, give them IDs, then put <a> tags in a list that link to those IDs and initialize them as tabs in the JQuery, right?
[20:28:07] <Colonel_Panic> I have no idea why this doesn't work
[20:28:22] <Colonel_Panic> it refuses to switch between the divs
[20:37:22] <ytang> i have a query problem with a test case which can easily reproduce my problem.  is there any one who is familiar with query can help me take a look?  it is about tabs and multiselect.  the test case is very simple.
[20:40:41] <ytang> hello?
[20:42:37] <ytang> ?
[20:44:40] <JonYoder> ytang: Just ask. I probably can't help you but I'll take a look. ;)
[20:45:28] <ytang> OK.  Thanks!  The question is at the query forum.  http://forum.jquery.com/topic/a-question-on-init-multiselect-within-jquery-tabs-ui
[20:45:55] <ytang> The test_case2.tar.gz contains a test case which can reproduce every single time.
[20:46:52] <ytang> Basically I am trying to init the multiselect widget by calling multiselect() in a $.get() callback.
[20:47:24] <ytang> But it always complains object has no method 'multiselect'.
[20:47:41] <ytang> However, if I don't do it in the callback, it works.
[20:48:10] <ytang> so it looks like in $.get() callback, I cannot access the multiselect() function/class/object.
[20:57:32] <ytang> ?
[21:16:00] <raj> shoky, wanted your opinion on something
[21:16:05] <raj> holla atcho boy
[21:27:48] <Whirl3d_> when loading your standard html page full of images, does docready fire before the images load or do you have to wait for the images to load before the document is ready?
[21:29:45] <gf3> Whirl3d_: It is fired when the document is ready, usually before the async assets have loaded
[21:30:16] <gf3> Whirl3d_: Use the `load` event if you want to wait until everything is done
[21:31:19] <Whirl3d_> I wanted to grab the images before they load and replace their src attributes.
[21:31:47] <Whirl3d_> how do I get the jquery version in console
[21:33:04] <gf3> Whirl3d_: $.fn.jquery
[21:34:32] <Whirl3d_> gf3 thanks. if I start a script with (function ($) {  do stuf }(jQuery)   and it should be (jquery) will it know the difference?
[21:34:54] <gf3> The difference between what?
[21:35:14] <Whirl3d_> aha, you didn't notice...lol jQuery and jquery   (cap Q)
[21:36:09] <gf3> Well those are two totally different objects
[21:36:48] <Whirl3d_> I was afraid you'd say that. LOL I was hoping maybe jquery grabbed them both for safety reasons...
[21:36:52] <Whirl3d_> my bad
[21:36:53] <gf3> You should use `jQuery` as that's what jQuery provides you with globally
[21:37:03] <gf3> jQuery.fn.jquery
[21:37:09] <Whirl3d_> oh well crap. That's not it then
[21:44:28] <Whirl3d_> so, gf3,  if I use (function($) { do stuff})(jQuery)  it should work regardless of anything I have set with noConflict, right?
[21:44:37] <gf3> Ja
[21:45:38] <Whirl3d_> drats. I use the line var imageList=$("img"); and then imageList.each(function () {......and get the error that imageList has no method each.
[21:46:00] <gf3> Lies
[21:46:02] <gf3> Make a gist
[21:46:05] <gf3> er
[21:46:07] <gf3> JSFiddle
[21:46:20] <gf3> Whirl3d_: Also this, via paul_irish → https://gist.github.com/361449
[21:57:06] <Whirl3d_> okay, wtf?
[21:57:34] <Whirl3d_> duckpunch? I'm gonna spend all night just wrapping my head around that post
[21:58:07] <Koganei> :o
[22:01:44] <Whirl3d_> gf3, mind looking at this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/xRsxk/30/
[22:02:29] <Whirl3d_> I'm not getting any errors in it and it appears to work as expected, but not when put in production.
[22:04:38] <gf3> Whirl3d_: I think you are over-engineering this
[22:05:05] <Whirl3d_> wouldn't be the first time, I'll tell you that much.
[22:05:09] <Whirl3d_> how so
[22:05:47] <gf3> Whirl3d_: What is your end goal here?
[22:06:01] <Whirl3d_> I just snag all the images, change their src to a loading image, load the real image, then swap the sources..
[22:06:23] <Whirl3d_> It should load a lot faster
[22:06:48] <program> i have a html form with validation plugin to validate a form it works when it loads standalone but when it loaded using load() of jquery the validation doesnot work
[22:06:55] <program> how to do thAT
[22:07:24] <gf3> Whirl3d_: Use a data uri and some CSS, cover the parent with that until the images are loaded
[22:07:34] <gf3> Whirl3d_: Boom!
[22:07:51] <program> I am loading the form.html  to another page <div> element
[22:07:56] <Colonel_Panic> Could somebody please take a look at my code and tell me what I'm doing wrong here?
[22:08:20] <Whirl3d_> the problem is that the html is pre-generated
[22:08:21] <Colonel_Panic> From what I can tell, everything looks OK yet it's still broken.
[22:08:47] <gf3> Whirl3d_: That's fine
[22:09:02] <Colonel_Panic> I've been at this for hours now and it's really  making my head hurt.
[22:09:06] <Colonel_Panic> http://www.mediafire.com/?42iiotni7dypl4t
[22:09:33] <Whirl3d_> data-uri?
[22:10:29] <program> is it possible to load a html form to another page div element using jquery
[22:11:06] <Cork> program: if the page is the same domain, and the div has an id, its simple
[22:11:15] <Cork> program: if its the same domain, its doable
[22:11:19] <Cork> else no
[22:11:35] <program> yeah it is in same domain
[22:11:47] <Cork> and does it have an id?
[22:12:07] <Colonel_Panic> is there any special trick to nesting tabs, and having multiple tabs on one page?
[22:12:37] <program> the form get loaded using load()  method but after loading its validation doesnot work<cork>
[22:13:01] <Cork> program: your event listeners need to use delegate
[22:13:08] <Cork> ?.on @ program
[22:13:09] <bot-t> program, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:13:13] <Cork> check the delegate section
[22:14:58] <program> <cork> http://jsfiddle.net/qw9eL/
[22:15:29] <program> see here the validation works but when i load this page into another the validation doesnot work
[22:16:47] <Cork> program: validate uses bind, so you need to rerun it after you've replaced the form
[22:17:40] <program> <cork> how to do that
[22:18:08] <Cork> program: in the second argument to .load
[22:18:28] <Cork> rerun your validator
[22:19:02] <program> <cork> could you show me some sample of codes
[22:20:03] <Cork> .load(url, function() { $().validate({}); });
[22:20:36] <Cork> alternatively you can put your validate call in a function and call it in both places
[22:23:11] <Whirl3d_> ColonelPanic, you have to get the first row of tabs working before you can do anything else. Your html is not setup correctly
[22:25:01] <program> <cork> it is not working
[22:25:07] <program> the 1st one
[22:25:15] <program> 2nd one i have not tried
[22:37:00] <ert3> hello
[22:38:47] <raj> hi
[22:39:58] <ert3> i was wondering if you guys would mind checking on a bit of code for me, see i just made my first coding response to a question ever and I wanted to make sure it was good
[22:41:11] <Cork> ?adk @ ert3
[22:41:12] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "adk" in jQuery Docs.
[22:41:18] <Cork> ?adsk @ ert3
[22:41:19] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "adsk" in jQuery Docs.
[22:41:20] <Cork> bah
[22:41:23] <Cork> ?ask @ ert3
[22:41:24] <bot-t> ert3, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:42:09] <ert3> ok a guy wanted to change form action in his code so I hunted around found some similar things in java and came up with this http://stackoverflow.com/a/11077305/1306735 have i given a viable answer
[22:42:52] <raj> I'm currently receiving all my results (images with some additional details). How can I allow pagination of these results?
[22:43:57] <ert3> raj ima need some context for that
[22:44:23] <Cork> ert3: wouldn't have used document.getElementById or document.forms but ya, the rest is ok
[22:44:26] <raj> what context?
[22:44:40] <ert3> WHOOOO validated by my peers
[22:44:46] <raj> just wanna know how I can do this, I'm currently displaying all 100000 results
[22:44:53] <raj> if the user chooses 50 per page
[22:45:00] <raj> I can show the first 50
[22:45:08] <raj> but how can I then show the next 50 and the next 50, etc
[22:45:16] <Cork> raj: accept an offset and a index to your request
[22:45:32] <raj> ah, and just walk through the list like that
[22:45:35] <Cork> then send that when you request, then when you want the next batch just update it
[22:45:39] <ert3> WHOO Validation by some one who is clearly smarter than I am
[22:46:08] <Cork> sorry not offset and index, offset and length
[22:46:20] <Cork> length is the number of posts to send and offset is where to start
[22:47:20] <Cork> infinite scroll is prob a nice solution to get it paging
[22:47:29] <Cork> ?g infinite scroll
[22:47:30] <bot-t> Cork, Infinite Scroll | jQuery plugin, Wordpress plugin, interaction design ... - http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[22:49:01] <ert3> design question I too am about to setup pagination for a blog right now 5 results for page would infinite scroll be a good idea for past posts ?
[22:49:21] <ert3> basically when you hit the infinite scroll change sql query to read out more lines
[22:49:53] <raj> yeah, I looked into infinite scroll, but it doesn't fit my needs
[22:49:56] <Cork> ert3: infinite scroll is often a good idea, cause its more natural to navigate
[22:50:16] * ert3 is now hunting for examples of this
[22:50:20] <Cork> the tricky part is to make it possible to link to a specific position
[22:50:36] <raj> Cork, are you a php guy?
[22:50:45] <Cork> raj: i know php yes
[22:50:58] <raj> or node.js?
[22:51:02] <Cork> i don't use it much though
[22:51:03] <Cork> raj: no
[22:51:08] <raj> just meant, what is your preferred backend
[22:51:09] <Cork> js isn't a server language
[22:51:15] <Cork> go or ruby
[22:51:22] <raj> really?!? Go?
[22:51:26] <Cork> yup
[22:51:26] <raj> v interesting
[22:51:34] <Cork> go if you need speed
[22:51:46] <raj> so you're a rails hacker
[22:51:57] <Cork> that to
[22:52:10] <Cork> i don't care that much about the backend though
[22:52:25] <Cork> as long as it can serv me my html and json i'm good
[22:52:59] <Cork> i used to use php A LOT before
[22:53:15] <Cork> but it feels like the language is dying so...
[22:53:29] <Cork> python is ok too
[22:53:30] <raj> cool
[22:53:39] <raj> what's the downside of python?
[22:53:51] <Cork> it runs as cgi
[22:53:59] <Cork> so its often hard to find hosting for it
[22:54:10] <Cork> thats true with all the mentioned solutions though
[22:54:35] <Whirl3d_> Cork, why doesn't jquery core use prototype inheritance (or does it) for things like $.Callbacks()?  http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.Callbacks
[22:55:43] <Cork> Whirl3d_: it does, but only for things that should be created on each instance
[22:55:52] <Cork> $.fn == prototype
[22:56:09] <Cork> things added on $ isn't added to each created class
[22:56:17] <Cork> $().Callbacks doens't exist for example
[22:56:30] <Cork> cause it doesn't make sense there
[22:56:41] <systemfault> Whirl3d_: With the prototypal pattern, you have some advantages.. like the possibilities of having private variables.
[22:56:50] <systemfault> possibility
[22:57:12] <Cork> s/class/object/
[22:57:26] <Whirl3d_> plus you don't have to redefine methods every instantiation. It will defer to the prototype's definition if necessary...
[22:57:51] <Cork> Whirl3d_: jquery doens't redefine on each instance
[22:58:58] <Whirl3d_> When writing a plugin, to use a function with methods attached does...whereas appying the methods to the function (objects) prototype doesnt...
[22:59:35] <ert3> Cork so you know PHP and JAVASCRIPT which is what I'm using to make my blog, I'm thinking of now using infinite scroll to move between pages while still having a next / last button on the pages.
[22:59:54] <Whirl3d_> please say that's true...I'm just starting to understand the reasoning behind use $.extend(func.prototype, methods) instead of defining them in the base function
[23:00:01] <Cork> ert3: thats not how infinite scroll works
[23:00:31] <ert3> Well here is my idea:
[23:00:31] <Cork> ert3: infinite scroll means when you scroll to the end (or close to) of the page, it will automatically add more data to the end
[23:01:23] <Cork> Whirl3d_: if your adding function to a ex. plugin name, then yes
[23:01:37] <Cork> Whirl3d_: prototype isn't a one stage, everything on it is prototype
[23:01:46] <Cork> Whirl3d_: each level has its own prototype
[23:01:47] <ert3> i setup a counter so when you scroll to page 2 the content for that scroll asks blogscroll.php?id=2 or something so it knows to ask for the next X amount of results. I am wondering how to cap it so id never = more than the amount of posts in existence and gives me a spot to halt the scroll
[23:02:21] <Cork> Whirl3d_: and if you want $().myPlugin.otherFunctions
[23:02:32] <Cork> they should be added toe the prototype for myPlugin
[23:02:57] <Whirl3d_> rather than defined in the myPlugin function
[23:03:04] <Cork> exactly
[23:03:23] <Cork> else yes, its redefined in each object
[23:03:27] <Whirl3d_> pfew. I am just starting to see the difference...
[23:03:32] <Cork> and thats a waist of memory
[23:03:40] <ert3> never mind now that i said it out loud I'm going to just make it and post to stack overflow my method and use that as a grading system
[23:04:08] <Cork> ert3: one solution is ex. make a normal pagination server side
[23:04:24] <Cork> that is it adds the next and prev links or something
[23:04:35] <Cork> and the script then checks for them and hides them
[23:04:37] <Whirl3d_> that's why I was confused to see what looks like jquery callbacks() doing their methods in the function declaration rather than prototype after
[23:04:55] <Cork> ert3:  if next doesn't exist, it doesn't do the ajax call
[23:05:31] <ert3> well right now i'm going to count the rows and divide by 5 dropping any remainder, so 5 posts per page. then I'm going to make the scroll iterate via something ill think of it until it reaches the max page
[23:05:56] <ert3> and at the same time I'm thinking of a way to prevent that many potential flash videos from bogging down someone who is scrolling since the count may get high
[23:05:59] <Cork> ert3: just remember to make the page work without js too :)
[23:06:20] <ert3> doing that first actually then I'll add the JS
[23:06:29] <Cork> exactly :)
[23:06:31] <ert3> stack up the problems don't just have em all at once
[23:06:52] * ert3 is not completely retarded
[23:07:17] <Cork> its not really that, its just that if you start by making it without is, and then adding js on top
[23:07:31] <Cork> you get a page thats usable without js, and all public pages should do that
[23:07:54] <Cork> if its behind a login, it matters less
[23:09:04] <ert3> yeah my behind login is ugly as fuck because its just for me, I'm purely working on the public pages right now
[23:09:21] <ert3> later i may distribute this one man CMS as a product but thats not happening anytime soon
[23:11:37] <Cork> ert3: make sure to be really careful about your input data if your building a cms
[23:11:49] <Cork> its VERY simple to get sql injections
[23:16:13] <systemfault> SQL injections are cool :D
[23:19:47] <systemfault> drop table rofl;
[23:22:17] <Cork> systemfault: or like https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/rubyonrails-security/l4L0TEVAz1k
[23:22:43] <systemfault> Yeah.. that one was bad :/
[23:23:00] <Cork> was?
[23:23:02] <Cork> its a new one
[23:23:10] <systemfault> I think it was patched, no?
[23:23:13] <systemfault> Ah!
[23:23:23] <Cork> yes the old and a new one is patched
[23:23:37] <systemfault> :/
[23:23:58] <Cork> "All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately. Please note, this vulnerability is a variant of CVE-2012-2661, even if you upgraded to address that issue, you must take action again. "
[23:24:43] <systemfault> Anyway.. it's not that bad, nobody uses rails </troll>
[23:24:47] <systemfault> :D
[23:24:51] <Cork> lol
[23:25:20] <Cork> we don't use the nested hash syntax so we'r ok
[23:25:31] <systemfault> Good :)
[23:25:36] <systemfault> You use it at work?
[23:25:40] <Cork> yes
[23:26:25] <systemfault> I'm thinking of learning ruby… but sinatra seems more attractive to me than rails to be honest
[23:26:27] <Cork> the page is like 90% js, and rails just pumps data, and does fancy queries
[23:26:34] <systemfault> Oh nice
[23:26:39] <systemfault> :D
[23:26:47] <systemfault> 90% JS = Win :)
[23:27:16] <Cork> its for managing the services, so ya, its fine
[23:28:00] <shoky> morning
[23:28:50] <Cork> systemfault: we'r slowly moving to a mixed rails and go environment though
[23:29:30] <systemfault> Why go? Nobody uses that :/
[23:29:31] <Cork> and if i would have created it today, i prob would have gone with go all out
[23:29:57] <Whirl3d_> morning shoky! course it's 2:3 am here so I guess that qualifies as morning.
[23:30:01] <Cork> systemfault: cause its a quite nice language, and dead simple to set up a webserver in
[23:30:13] <Cork> systemfault: no messy cgi solutions
[23:30:17] <systemfault> I didn't know
[23:30:59] <systemfault> I don't have the chance to use ruby or any other interesting language where I work..
[23:31:07] <systemfault> It's a PHP/Java shop..
[23:31:42] <Cork> i deeply hate java on servers
[23:31:50] <Cork> they ALWAYS have performance issues
[23:32:18] <Lucky--> Need opinion, per-se "intuitive" feel: Which one would you be more comfortable filling out, and why? http://www.instant-advance.com/requestform.html http://www.24-7cashadvance.com/requestform.html
[23:32:32] <systemfault> Performance-wise.. they're usually superior to everything else… as long as a ORM isn't used.
[23:32:48] <systemfault> Hibernate KILLS performance.
[23:33:34] <Cork> systemfault: we'r hosting three services thats built in java, and they are the constant source of problem
[23:33:45] <systemfault> Cork: Sad :/
[23:33:48] <Cork> heck even exchange is less problem
[23:33:55] <systemfault> :D
[23:34:01] <systemfault> I hate exchange..
[23:34:19] <systemfault> Lucky--: Both ugly to me.
[23:34:24] <Whirl3d_> exchange is the worst
[23:34:30] <Lucky--> systemfault: what would you do differently?
[23:34:45] <systemfault> Lucky--: https://www.24-7cashadvance.com/requestform.html is a bit better.
[23:34:52] <Cork> systemfault: btw http://golangtutorials.blogspot.se/2011/06/web-programming-with-go-first-web-hello.html
[23:35:10] <Cork> as you see you can make a working webserver with like 5 lines of code
[23:35:18] <Cork> no external dependencies
[23:35:18] <Lucky--> systemfault: im just trying to determine if expanded form converts better then collapsed form. On a psychological level
[23:35:38] <systemfault> Lucky--: Try A/B testing it then
[23:35:39] <Whirl3d_> def collapsed
[23:35:46] <Lucky--> systemfault: yea, I will
[23:35:54] <systemfault> http://www.instant-advance.com/requestform.html is a mess...
[23:36:04] <systemfault> The section names are unreadable...
[23:36:08] <Lucky--> yea that part
[23:36:12] <Lucky--> i didnt do
[23:36:18] <Lucky--> i would obviously reformat the text display
[23:36:18] <systemfault> The bullets at the left seem out of place..
[23:36:29] <Lucky--> it was just a what feels better lets undo the expansion
[23:36:41] <Lucky--> and see if pursuing cleaning it up expanded is a worth while thing
[23:36:54] <systemfault> Both pages seem like someone tried to stick as much information as possible in a small area
[23:37:08] <systemfault> I would personally give some "air" to the page..
[23:37:44] <systemfault> Like adding a small margin-bottom to those row-fluid s
[23:38:09] <systemfault> Even 5px would be nicer
[23:39:01] <systemfault> Cork: Cute
[23:39:53] <Colonel_Panic> Whirl3d, what's wrong with the markup? I've been looking at this thing for hours now and I can't see it
[23:39:57] <Lucky--> think a tabstrip like: http://demos.kendoui.com/web/tabstrip/index.html would be better? or just expanded and cleaned up?
[23:41:13] <systemfault> Lucky--: I don't personally think so
[23:41:24] <Colonel_Panic> Have I made a mistake with the divs for the tabs?
[23:41:52] <Lucky--> systemfault: the input is appreciated.
[23:41:57] <systemfault> :)
[23:42:14] <ert3> @Cork hmm is that why I'm using PDO
[23:42:23] <Lucky--> by no means attached to ego, attached to the $$$. The ego follows the $$ :-P
[23:42:46] <ert3> Cork: ^
[23:43:07] <Cork> got you the first time :)
[23:45:30] <Lucky--> systemfault: http://www.instant-advance.com/requestform.html little better? (i am not putting huge time investments in it tonight)
[23:45:50] <systemfault> The sections headers need padding
[23:46:30] <Lucky--> yea and get rid of the bullets
[23:46:37] <systemfault> Lucky--:  something like 6px 18px
[23:47:01] <systemfault> get rid of the bullets.. indeed, add the margin-bottom to the rows
[23:47:06] <Lucky--> lol I should probably just stop now, and play some d3
[23:47:15] <Lucky--> and get back to it in the morning
[23:47:22] <Lucky--> otherwise you know how it goes :-P
[23:47:50] <systemfault> :D
[23:51:58] <Lucky--> my ass lost $700 last week. Fronted $1k for traffic, accidentally put Income_Monthly = Pay_per_period instead of Income_Monthly = Pay_per_period * Pay_Frequency
