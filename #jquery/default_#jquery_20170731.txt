(https://github.com/jhyland87/DataTables-Keep-Conditions) The issue I am having is that on serverSide on load it isn't setting the table on the proper page or results

[10:07:20] <aways> I thing that $('selector').get(0).outerHTML
[10:07:45] <aways> but this syntax isn't really fine
[10:08:08] <VX> aways https://jsfiddle.net/oq8tnhax/
[10:08:14] <shoky_> aways:  $().prop('outerHTML')

[10:34:24] <IamTrying> window.focus(); - How to bring the window on top? I have a Call center application in Google chrome where its ringing. But the Agent is in Firefox doing some other tasks. In such case how to bring the Google chrome on top or show some taskbar blinking sort of (for OSX no task bar)
[10:34:50] <IamTrying> .focus() tried in OSX but not working .
[10:40:00] <aways> Ok extended question :) How can create a html string with an event binded on ?
[10:40:22] <aways> I need to create a html string for DataTable with an on('click' event
[10:53:19] <samsamek> I’m using .next(‘div#box’) to find the next div#box, when it exists, it returns the element object, when it doesn’t exist, it returns a ‘provObject’ element object
[10:53:40] <samsamek> How can I easily test if the .next(‘div#box’) exists?
[10:54:13] <samsamek> if … == true wouldnt work because .next obviously ALWAYS returns a value (either object or prevObject)
[11:03:44] <itaipu> \wc
[11:56:56] <Helixdnb> Hey everyone - question, say I have a JSON setup, either via json file or jquery variable
[11:57:04] <Helixdnb> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/103200384d09c6858b417a9586f9928c
[11:58:57] <Helixdnb> how would I be able to parse that into multiple subsequent <select> fields? ie select 1 shows just versions, select 2 shows countries based on value of select 1, select 3 shows platform values based on select 2, and select 4 shows retailer values based on select 3
[11:59:34] <Helixdnb> <option value="VALUE FROM JSON">NAME_FROM_JSON</option>
[12:38:14] <anjen> Hi, I know this isn't strictly a jquery quesiton, but does anyone know how to get Google Chrome's debugger to "see" javascript in a remote page (ie, one called using XHR)?
[12:40:44] <robertmaxrees> anjen hrm?  should "see" it just fiune.
[12:40:45] <robertmaxrees> *fine
[12:42:06] <anjen> Hi robertmaxrees. Unfortunately, although I can see the javascript via "elements" it doesn't show up in the Sources tab and can't be debugged. Only top level page content seems to be accessible
[12:42:39] <anjen> dynamic content that has embedded javascript becomes functionally invisible
[12:44:02] <robertmaxrees> i assume you don't have access to the third party codde?
[12:44:04] <robertmaxrees> *code
[12:45:10] <anjen> I do (I'm the developer), but it can't be debugged directly, as it relies on data provided by the top level page.
[12:45:30] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - just pop in a debugger; statement into the file you're trying to debug.
[12:45:34] <robertmaxrees> that should fix it.
[12:45:52] <robertmaxrees> tyhere's also a trick with adding a sourcemap comment.  i can't exactly remember it though.
[12:46:39] <anjen> thanks...I'll give that a try. and the term "sourcemap" might help me find an article.. Been googling and googling without finding anything related
[12:46:51] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9092125/how-to-debug-dynamically-loaded-javascriptwith-jquery-in-the-browsers-debugge
[12:48:07] <anjen> robertmaxrees: Thank you much for that link! My searches have been deadends. Much appreciated!
[12:48:14] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[13:15:48] <Helixdnb> hey question
[13:17:06] <robertmaxrees> heullo
[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> *hello
[13:17:20] <Helixdnb> ok so
[13:17:21] <Helixdnb> sec
[13:18:40] <Helixdnb> https://pastebin.com/UfdzBd9d
[13:19:03] <Helixdnb> alright so say I have this setup
[13:19:44] <Helixdnb> or even with digital/retail setup as "Digital": "digital" and "Retail": "retail"
[13:20:18] <robertmaxrees> what's the difference between version and value?
[13:20:36] <Helixdnb> how would I be able to return just the first/top layer
[13:20:49] <robertmaxrees> first top layer as in...?
[13:20:53] <Helixdnb> well I'm trying to return these into a series of selects
[13:21:04] <Helixdnb> https://pastebin.com/UfdzBd9d
[13:21:21] <robertmaxrees> al;ready posted that :)
[13:21:31] <robertmaxrees> okay, so for each of these you want to output some markup?
[13:21:39] <Helixdnb> yea I know, well what I'm asking is - as far as first level goes
[13:21:46] <robertmaxrees> "first level" meaning?
[13:21:56] <robertmaxrees> the forst array index?
[13:21:57] <Helixdnb> first level meaning digital and retail
[13:22:54] <Helixdnb> then if digital is selected, list countries <option value="VALUE">KEY</option>
[13:22:59] <Helixdnb> etc etc
[13:23:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/knyprjen/
[13:24:01] <Helixdnb> hmmm
[13:24:04] <Helixdnb> ok, sec
[13:24:16] <robertmaxrees> guess i'm not clear on exactly what you're looking for heh.
[13:31:30] <Helixdnb> ok
[13:31:31] <Helixdnb> so then
[13:31:34] <Helixdnb> data.forEach(function(currentEntry) { 	$('#version_select').append($('<option>', {     	value: currentEntry.value,     	text: currentEntry.version 	})); 	console.log(currentEntry.version); });
[13:31:40] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:31:44] <robertmaxrees> there's a much better way to do that.
[13:31:50] <Helixdnb> do tell
[13:32:09] <robertmaxrees> don't append one piece at a time.
[13:32:22] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle, first of all.
[13:32:37] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you building this in JS?
[13:32:44] <robertmaxrees> why not have your backend spit it out correctly?
[13:37:45] <Helixdnb> I'm planning on doing it via sql in the future
[13:38:27] <Helixdnb> https://jsfiddle.net/knyprjen/1/
[13:39:22] <robertmaxrees> what's your current backend?
[13:39:32] <robertmaxrees> and squl shouldn't spit out markup heh.
[13:39:51] <Helixdnb> no I know
[13:40:06] <Helixdnb> I would have done it via sql and php
[13:40:18] <Helixdnb> and ajax
[13:41:56] <robertmaxrees> so https://jsfiddle.net/knyprjen/2/
[13:42:19] <robertmaxrees> the basic idea is that you only do a single append instead of many.
[13:42:27] <Helixdnb> that's smart
[13:42:27] <robertmaxrees> this is just one of many ways to do that.
[14:02:32] <Darren_> http://kaylagotchased.com/ when I click on menu items, it doesn't exactly take me to its respective div, it's like off by 20ish pixels. I think I have all related js in here https://pastebin.com/1r9hLmx0, I am stumped on this one
[14:03:57] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ https://i.imgur.com/sVter9y.png
[14:04:03] <robertmaxrees> is this not where it should be?
[14:05:01] <Darren_> yeah, but the section starts earlier http://imgur.com/a/0c160
[14:05:04] <Darren_> like a solid 20-30px
[14:06:27] <robertmaxrees> need to add that height manually i'm afraid.  the issue is .rsvp-date
[14:07:41] <Darren_> but it sits within .show-on-scroll, shouldn't it factor it in?
[14:08:18] <robertmaxrees> fixed positioning messes with that.
[14:08:27] <Darren_> damn

[15:44:58] <mattcrane> hi peeps
[15:46:14] <mattcrane> ….i have an input element with a name attribute of adults_nationality[489][] —there are multiple of these in a form and i can’t work how to select all instances of adults_nationality[][] where the first array level is a wildcard
[15:46:46] <mattcrane> i.e. jQuery(‘adults_nationality[*][]’)
[15:49:18] <pavonia> mattcrane: You can't match on that pattern exactly, AFAIK
[15:50:38] <pavonia> What you could do is to look for a prefix, suffix or infix, like $('[name^="adults_nationality["]') to look for elements whos name attribute begins with that string
[15:53:13] <pavonia> And then iterate over the result with a regex, I guess
[15:59:54] <mattcrane> thanks all..i’ll give that a go!
[16:19:45] <Darren_> http://kaylagotchased.com/#!/Gallery I'm using three different things here to get this gallery working the way I want it to: MixItUp, Owl Carousel, and Lightbox. Everything is working pretty solid but the moment the page goes into a mobile view, which inits Owl Carousel, it shows the full gallery and I needed it to be split by "album"
[17:35:02] <SomeJQ> Is there a way to stop jquery from adding a class through console? The current site, on scroll adds a class to an element which has proven difficult to try and go around. I'm trying to test something on the current site from a UX standpoint, and this class doesn't help.
[18:16:51] <catbadger> In my area, mean wage for a senior fullstack developer in my area is 80-120k (in local currency). a new programmer who has only been using react for 2 years can make the upper end of that. I've been coding over 20years and i make 55k. Why is the industry leaning this way?
[18:17:15] <robertmaxrees> catbadger that's a loaded question :)
[18:17:24] <robertmaxrees> what are you writing code in these days?>
[18:17:57] <catbadger> PHP ontop of (both) mysql and/or postgres. frontends in jquery or pure javascript.
[18:18:18] <robertmaxrees> and how many times have you changed jobs?
[18:18:21] <catbadger> HAHAHAHA
[18:18:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:18:28] <catbadger> like once a year for my whole career
[18:18:37] <catbadger> trying to get more money every time.
[18:18:49] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you using any frameworks?
[18:19:06] <catbadger> oh i do
[18:19:15] <catbadger> backbone lately
[18:19:32] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're shifting jobs too much while not marketing yourself very well.
[18:19:39] <robertmaxrees> that would be my guess at least.
[18:19:42] <catbadger> hmm
[18:20:06] <catbadger> so I should just eat up the low wage for a few years? I'm 36 and get no retirement plan.
[18:20:06] <robertmaxrees> changing job every year can seem a little... sketch to a company.
[18:20:29] <catbadger> ^
[18:20:31] <robertmaxrees> back up - are you asking what to do about the problem, or are you asking what the problem is? :)
[18:20:49] <catbadger> More what to do about the problem. I think the answer is learn react.
[18:21:07] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[18:21:24] <robertmaxrees> combo of "stick around somewhere for a little while" and "get more libraries/frameworks under your belt.
[18:21:33] <catbadger> fffffff
[18:21:34] <catbadger> kk
[18:21:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise there may be an issue with your interviews.
[18:22:00] <catbadger> I'm not getting interviews.
[18:22:08] <robertmaxrees> how are you switching jobs so frequently then?
[18:22:16] <catbadger> :) networking
[18:22:29] <robertmaxrees> do you ever negotiate pay?
[18:22:38] <catbadger> never very well apparently
[18:23:21] <robertmaxrees> another big thing is to know what you bring to the table.
[18:23:27] <catbadger> hmm
[18:23:44] <catbadger> I thought experience was going to help me, but it seems as though it does not.
[18:23:46] <robertmaxrees> PHP dev that works with mysql/postgres and knows jquery and maybe a little backbone?  lots of dudes with that.
[18:24:05] <robertmaxrees> oh, experience helps, but think about how many people fit that description.
[18:24:17] <robertmaxrees> also: the people you're networking with may be low-balling you on purpose.
[18:24:39] <robertmaxrees> I'd almost try applying somewhere else and see what you can get.
[18:24:39] <catbadger> it seems they are. thanks robert. I think I know where to go from here. You're always so helpful
[18:24:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah def.  i was in a similar spot a few years ago.
[18:25:01] <catbadger> I've been throwing out my resume nonstop and getting very little back.
[18:25:30] <catbadger> I think it's time to update my marketing efforts. ew i haven't updated my dot com in over a year... XD
[18:25:37] <robertmaxrees> haha
[18:25:54] <catbadger> yup you're right as usual sir. :)
[18:26:04] <catbadger> how did you pull up when you found yourself here?
[18:27:18] <robertmaxrees> honestly i got way lucky.  i found a great company that was willing to give me a real shot.  they offered me a 20% raise out of the gate and then saw what I was capable of and kept giving me money.  but my previous employer was way lowballing me.
[18:27:39] <catbadger> k
[18:27:52] <robertmaxrees> also: how's your resume?
[18:28:22] <robertmaxrees> ie it's not more than 1 page, super lengthy, etc, right?
[18:29:03] <catbadger> yeah it sucks.
[18:29:11] <catbadger> 2 pages, 9pt font
[18:29:15] <robertmaxrees> nonono.
[18:29:34] <catbadger> yeah it needs work
[18:29:39] <catbadger> I'll start there I thihnk
[18:29:53] <catbadger> waws hoping there was a magic bullet.
[18:29:57] <catbadger> i like my job here.
[18:29:59] <robertmaxrees> think about recruiters/hiring managers/interviewers - we don't have time to do more than 1 page.  12-14 pt font.  keep it punchy.
[18:29:59] <catbadger> :(
[18:30:01] <robertmaxrees> well
[18:30:13] <robertmaxrees> nobody said you have to accept an offer.  you can use that as leverege to get a raise.
[18:30:18] <catbadger> good call
[18:30:26] <catbadger> I should really get back to waiting for the boss
[18:30:41] <catbadger> May I linkedin you?
[18:30:45] <robertmaxrees> sure!
[18:30:47] <catbadger> kk
[18:30:52] <catbadger> ttyl
[20:14:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:09:12] <Sayona_> Hi
[21:22:19] <Sayona_> Hi, at this code https://paste.laravel.io/DN1wZ#1 I get TypeError: demo2.find(...).size is not a function
[21:23:16] <JohnDoe2> there's no such thing as a single character wildcard for selectors, right? Maybe I don't know how to google for it... :D I'm trying to match id's that start with exam and end in a different number. No regex selectors either?
[21:29:54] <JohnDoe2> nvm found James Padolsey's simple implementation. Maybe adding ? on top of ^,$,* wouldn't be a bad idea. ;)
[22:02:35] <Helixdnb> hey everyone - quick question
[22:03:24] <Helixdnb> how would I find out the href attribute of an element that has an attribute of edition="1"?
[22:03:28] <Helixdnb> er
[22:03:51] <Helixdnb> find out a url attribute's value when it has an edition attribute with a value of 1
[22:03:52] <Helixdnb> ie
[22:04:17] <Helixdnb> <option url="www.google.com" edition="1">Thing</option>
[22:04:38] <Helixdnb> f
[22:05:07] <Helixdnb> nm, think I figured it out
[22:21:28] <jak2000> Helixdnb hi
