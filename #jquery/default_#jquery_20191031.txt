[10:45:11] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/OLX5K my function doesnt return true why is that?
[10:46:48] <shoky> because you are returning from the .keyup(function() {     callback, not from your fullName function.  you can't return a value that will only be available later (asynchronous)
[10:47:00] <shoky> do whatever you want in the callback
[10:47:29] <primitivMedia> because i have a function inside a function
[10:47:46] <shoky> and because of the 2nd thing i said, which is more important
[10:47:49] <primitivMedia> how do i return true inside my fullname
[10:48:17] <shoky> you cannot return an async value.  especiallly not when it's an event handler, that runs multiple times...
[12:57:33] <jak2000> arghh cant detect enter key here more code: https://jsfiddle.net/quhzvrw5/
[12:57:59] <robertmaxrees> we talked about this the other day...
[12:58:14] <jak2000> yes but not do the job
[12:58:26] <jak2000> can give me a hand?
[12:58:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/srbwdmL6/
[12:58:45] <robertmaxrees> you're not selection the correct element, just like we told you.
[13:00:01] <robertmaxrees> *selecting
[13:01:44] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to detect when the enter key is pressed jak2000
[13:04:32] <robertmaxrees> lol i like how you asked the same question in ##javascript.  fwiw https://jsfiddle.net/quhzvrw5/ works.
[13:04:53] <robertmaxrees> Shouldn't have assumed it doesn't.  that's my bad.
[13:04:55] <jak2000> because: the user use a Scan Barcoe.... the user, read and automatically send a Enter
[13:05:11] <robertmaxrees> so you'd like to close it?
[13:05:30] <jak2000> i want to detect the enter: and do an ajax request
[13:05:46] <robertmaxrees> that last fiddle detects the enter keypress then.
[13:05:50] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[13:06:10] <jak2000> but not display the alert :(
[13:06:14] <robertmaxrees> it does for me.
[13:06:30] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/67rTfd0.png
[13:07:58] <robertmaxrees> works in ff and chrome, even.
[13:08:08] <jak2000> yes i see
[13:08:15] <jak2000> when i load the fiddle get this error: Uncaught TypeError: document.find is not a function
[13:08:34] <robertmaxrees> which fiddle?
[13:08:47] <jak2000> https://imgur.com/a/IuPH8id
[13:08:54] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/srbwdmL6/
[13:09:01] <robertmaxrees> ignore that
[13:09:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/quhzvrw5/
[13:09:04] <robertmaxrees> ^ this works.
[13:10:12] <jak2000> ok... tested and display the enter
[13:10:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  that's one of the ones you sent out.
[13:10:25] <jak2000> can you test next: type: IN   and hit enter
[13:10:35] <jak2000> sorry have bad jssfidle link
[13:11:08] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:11:18] <robertmaxrees> so is that the issue you're trying to solve for?
[13:11:22] <jak2000> yes
[13:11:29] <jak2000> IN hit enter and not display the 13
[13:11:49] <robertmaxrees> looks like they're hijacking all of the events for that, so you won't really be able to acommodate.
[13:12:15] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/gLot09qd/
[13:12:25] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:12:39] <robertmaxrees> randomly linking to different fiddles isn't helpful.
[13:13:40] <robertmaxrees> the best you'll be able to do here is to bind directly on the input itself.
[13:13:51] <robertmaxrees> which is jank, but it doesn't look like you have any other options.
[13:13:53] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rv0p6k9h/1/
[13:15:04] <jak2000> interesting
[13:15:16] <jak2000> solved
[13:15:21] <robertmaxrees> they're likely stopping event propagation.
[13:15:42] <robertmaxrees> i might look for a plugin that better supports what you need.
[13:16:13] <jak2000> ok, the process is: 1) user scan bar code..... 0012010202<enter> and do an ajax request.... Select sum(qry) from.....
[13:16:22] <robertmaxrees> er
[13:16:30] <robertmaxrees> what does this dropdown have to do with anything?
[13:19:09] <jak2000> populated with 200 items, sample: <option value='010121212'>Apple</option>   <option value='013121212'>Orange</option> <option value='010121217'>Juice</option>   <option value='015121212'>Chair</option>
[13:19:12] <jak2000> and so on...
[13:19:22] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[13:19:33] <robertmaxrees> so why do you need the dropdown?
[13:19:45] <robertmaxrees> are you just using it as a way to search for an item?
[13:20:18] <jak2000> because the user also use this dropdown for search manually via keyboard.
[13:20:28] <jak2000> you recommend me better a input text?
[13:20:30] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[13:20:39] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i'd just hand roll what you're looking for at that point.
[13:20:48] <robertmaxrees> since this plugin doesn't really do what you want.
[13:22:36] <jak2000> ok
[17:16:26] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/LJBQG
[17:16:32] <primitivMedia> why does this always return true when i click submit
[17:16:48] <robertmaxrees> because you're not calling the function primitivMedia
[17:16:57] <robertmaxrees> you're just checking if fileCheck1 is defined.
[17:17:13] <primitivMedia> ohhh
[17:19:28] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:19:41] <primitivMedia> brilliant! THanks mate :)
[17:20:13] <primitivMedia> so if i add ()
[17:20:13] <robertmaxrees> also: if you're gonna do one of those if (someThing === somethingElse) { return true } or w/e, jkust return the statement.
[17:20:15] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/4CJPS
[17:20:17] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[17:20:17] <primitivMedia> afterwards, that should work?
[17:20:27] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[17:20:31] <primitivMedia>   if(fileCheck1()){
[17:20:38] <robertmaxrees> should work, yeah.
[17:20:47] <primitivMedia> doesnt do anything now tho
[17:21:06] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[17:21:07] <robertmaxrees> you don'
[17:21:14] <robertmaxrees> *don't get the console log?
[17:21:24] <primitivMedia> ok i got it to work!
[17:21:33] <robertmaxrees> Cool
[17:21:35] <primitivMedia> had to amke my functino return true instead of false
[17:21:41] <primitivMedia> true was never set
[17:40:53] <primitivMedia>  if((!fullName()) || (!fileCheck1()) || (!fileCheck2()) || (!fileCheck3())){
[17:41:00] <primitivMedia> is this incorrect syntax?
[17:41:19] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[17:41:35] <robertmaxrees> without knowing what those functions are supposed to do or w/e
[17:41:51] <robertmaxrees> you do have some extra parens but it should function.
[17:43:40] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/COY3W
[17:44:16] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange way to do that.
[17:44:32] <robertmaxrees> I might abstract those a little.
[17:44:43] <robertmaxrees> but :shrug: syntax wise, your stuff is fine.
[17:44:46] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[17:45:43] <primitivMedia> no, i can make it soon ish
[17:45:48] <primitivMedia> just doing a few things at once
[17:46:30] <robertmaxrees> k
[18:03:53] <primitivMedia> ok im back
[18:07:25] <primitivMedia> my fullname function triggers just fine
[18:08:39] <primitivMedia> i can give you the url i mworking off of
[18:08:41] <primitivMedia> to see the html
[20:43:51] <loganlee> hello https://jsfiddle.net/me64kqxa/1/ here i thought first ul would be removed but it is not
[21:21:30] <loganlee> hello how does this work? https://codepen.io/logan-lee/pen/VwwrVxG
[21:29:46] <shoky> with a click handler?
[21:42:28] <loganlee> shoky, no i don't understand the logic of end() and remove() in this example
[21:50:41] <loganlee> what is returned by appendTo()?
[21:50:52] <loganlee> i know what it does but not what is returned
[21:53:31] <loganlee> oh i see
[21:58:34] <loganlee> so does remove() works on currently selected elements?
[22:02:31] <loganlee> i got it i think
[22:26:21] <shoky> docs have all the answers
