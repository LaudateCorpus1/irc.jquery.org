[07:24:51] <sine0> one at a time please, i cant keep up
[09:45:06] <superduper> hi.. how to check multiple obj keys for duplicate... here is how I check on one --https://jsfiddle.net/89d2n5ak/
[09:46:09] <superduper> Here I check if "quantity" has same value... how to check quantity and email ?
[09:46:38] <superduper> can I do :  obj[keys[i]['quantity'] && keys[i]['email']] = keys[i]; ?
[09:46:57] <Cork> i would prob use an object isntead of the array and just set obj[email+quantity] = {}; and then do Object.values(obj) to get the array
[09:47:03] <Cork> then you dedupe it automatically
[09:47:33] <superduper> can I use it with my push?
[09:47:46] <Cork> no, arrays isn't uniq
[09:48:01] <Cork> so you will have to loop it and remove duplicates afterwards if you use array
[09:48:26] <superduper> thats what Im doing now later on my code
[09:48:49] <superduper> but want to check for both quantity and email
[09:49:09] <Cork> ya, so combine the keys you want to make uniq on
[09:49:28] <Cork> (just like sql servers do for uniq indexes)
[09:52:11] <superduper> like obj[keys[i]['email'+'date']] = keys[i]; ?
[09:53:11] <superduper> oh,, think this works.. obj[keys[i]['email']+keys[i]['date']] = keys[i];
[09:53:43] <superduper> thx Cork
[09:53:48] <Cork> np
[10:52:20] <paule32> hello
[10:52:25] <paule32> what is wrong here: http://dpaste.com/1MNHSFQ
[11:59:07] <znf> Hi. I'm trying to use a jquery library, FlipClock, while it works fine stand-alone, I can not actually make it work on my website. Not sure what's going on exactly: https://www.chroot.ro/countdown-test-not-public/ vs. https://www.chroot.ro/compiled/test.html
[11:59:14] <znf> Could anyone be able to figure this out? :-/
[12:02:36] <taplar> quick glance, the value of `diff` is NaN
[12:03:14] <taplar> futureDate resolved to Invalid Date
[12:04:59] <znf> ah, found it
[12:05:10] <znf> taplar, uhm, why would it be NaN?
[12:05:10] <znf> :-/
[12:05:35] <taplar> cause the future date is invalid
[12:05:36] <znf> maybe timezones?
[12:05:47] <znf> well, it works fine here? https://jsfiddle.net/Znuff/g3dLckas/12/
[12:06:32] <taplar> same issue for me in that fiddle, in firefox
[12:07:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xmLb7042/  countdowns for me in firefox, granted I adjusted the isoformat of the date, and removed the timezone
[12:07:26] <znf> hmmm, weird, Chrome works
[12:07:31] <taplar> i'm trying to find how you'd put the +2 on there for the Z format
[12:07:52] <znf> but yeah, same for me in FF
[12:08:05] <taplar> safest bet is to stick with the iso format
[12:08:40] <znf> mhm, but I need the countdown to my time-zone
[12:08:59] <taplar> right, which is why i'm trying to find the pattern for putting the zone in there with the Z
[12:09:59] <znf> 2019-11-30T00:00+02:00 seems to be fine
[12:10:12] <znf> https://stackoverflow.com/a/44289545/2259612 at least that's what I'm getting from https://stackoverflow.com/a/44289545/2259612
[12:10:15] <znf> erm
[12:11:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xmLb7042/1/, that looks like it's it
[12:12:26] <znf> well, +02:00 actually :P
[12:12:29] <znf> -2 would be gmt-2
[12:12:39] <taplar> yeah, whatever you need, :)
[12:13:56] <taplar> but on a sidenote, are you familiar with your browsers debugging tools?
[12:15:26] <znf> yes
[12:15:59] <taplar> k.  if not I was going to show you how to set a breakpoint in the script, to show you how I found that the diff was NaN and the date was invalid
[12:16:58] <znf> I mean, I did initially did it in the console, by checking the output of: new Date("2019-11-30 00:00:00 GMT+200");
[12:17:07] <znf> but didn't bother to also check in Firefox
[12:56:40] <taplar> man today is dragging on
[12:56:45] <robertmaxrees> agreed.
[12:59:01] <taplar> hah, this just gave me a chuckle.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59109264/why-i-dont-get-valid-output-in-console-when-i-use-map-function
[13:00:19] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:00:27] <robertmaxrees> oops
[13:00:40] <taplar> it's so hard sometimes not to commen with "seriously?
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> i always chalk stuff like that up to "been staring at it too long"
[13:01:18] <taplar> or brand spankin new to programming
[13:03:31] <robertmaxrees> one of my favorite examples of this type of "d'oh!" error was when a coworker had gotten me and one othe engineer to go over to his machine to figure out why a simple if statement wasn't working.  even full on had him replace the evaluation with 'false' and it still ran the 'true' block.
[13:03:50] <robertmaxrees> this is what the code looked like, weird curlies and all: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xh4fzj6r/
[13:05:59] <taplar> hah!
[13:06:02] <taplar> nice
[13:06:19] <robertmaxrees> made him "fix" the opening curly placement and we all smacked our heads.
[13:06:30] <taplar> got smacked in the colon
[13:06:36] <robertmaxrees> lel
[13:08:48] <taplar> I have to be careful about that stuff.  Its one of my favorite things to go in and put && false or || true on things to force logic to run, rather than changing data.  Especially if I'm pointing to an environment our functional tests use.
[13:12:42] <robertmaxrees> hah, we don't dev against environments like that partially because of stuff like that.
[17:55:04] <taplar> 6 minutes to go.  i'm going to go to the chinese place and get me some noodles and rice, and go home and hide
[17:55:42] <robertmaxrees> you can hid for now, but Monday will come no metter what >:)
[17:56:16] <robertmaxrees> *hide
[17:56:31] <taplar> https://i.imgflip.com/3hye8u.jpg
[17:57:43] <taplar> now you want to see something freaky?  you're first reaction to that meme might be a chuckle....... but stare into its black eyes for a bit.
[17:58:01] <taplar> creapy A.F.
[17:58:19] <robertmaxrees> hahahhaa
[17:58:25] <robertmaxrees> those big ol' irises.
