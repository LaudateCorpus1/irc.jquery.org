[01:43:05] <pucko> If I go to https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ it says "version added: 3.0". Which is wrong, no? jQuery 3.0 doesn't exist yet?
[01:43:38] <Cork> pucko: the documentation needs to be ahead of the release
[01:43:50] <Cork> else ppl can't look up how things work when it gets released
[01:44:39] <pucko> aight
[01:44:51] <pucko> Just found it confusing
[01:45:54] <Cork> 3.0 not too far of, so no not really
[01:45:59] <Cork> *is not*
[01:48:58] <jak2000> hi
[01:53:21] <jak2000> Cork how are you
[01:53:25] <jak2000> where are you from?
[02:25:07] <LavaFlake> Does anyone know of an efficient way to merge two arrays that meets these conditions? http://pastebin.com/4Fh4UeEB The only solution I can think of involves a lot of inArray and grep
[02:35:45] <Cork> LavaFlake: the best you can get is client.concat(server).filter(function(v,i,a) { return !(a.indexOf(v) < i) && server.indexOf(v) >= 0; });
[02:36:15] <Cork> but ya, that is basically a bunch of inArray
[02:39:50] <hellyeah> yuo
[02:39:55] <hellyeah> is that statement decent?
[02:39:58] <hellyeah> you can bind more then one events to button. Normally you can add event to button in jquery is like that.
[02:39:58] <hellyeah> Button has a lot of event jquery web site is place to go indeed.
[02:39:58] <hellyeah> $(‘.buttonClass’).on(‘click’.function(){}); you can do with this way this is binding event.
[02:39:58] <hellyeah> Var x = function(){] $(‘.buttonClass’).on(‘click’, x); you can also use that way. The thing you need to focus on here, you type x instead of x(). The reason of that you give the function content for invoking in button click.   So button can have more than one job
[02:42:27] <LavaFlake> Cork, thanks so much! I was on line 12 of my disastrous attempt
[02:42:35] <LavaFlake> It does exactly what I want
[02:43:13] <Cork> LavaFlake: do you follow what it does?
[02:52:36] <hellyeah> as far as i understand map and reduce is kinda same
[02:58:52] <LavaFlake> Cork, yeah I had seen a similar solution on stackoverflow and I was using concat but not filter. Concat just... well, it's in the name, and the filter removes the duplicates. I think it does it by checking to see if it's the first time it's seen the value and then whether or not it's also on the server
[02:59:40] <Cork> LavaFlake: kinda, it checks if it is the first instance in the resulting array
[03:00:04] <Cork> filter doesn't remember what it has seen, so it can't know by it self
[03:00:06] <LavaFlake> yeah that's what i meant by "seen it before
[03:00:11] <LavaFlake> as in
[03:01:13] <LavaFlake> wait no i lost it i swear i had it figured out
[03:03:41] <LavaFlake> Cork, ok so like it searches the array for the value and then checks the index of that against i. since it's ! that clause if it's the first time it's looped through that value it'll return true
[03:04:28] <LavaFlake> and the second clause checks if it's in the server array, if it is it returns 0 or higher and with both true that gets to stay
[03:04:39] <Cork> ya
[03:04:55] <Cork> and if it exists again the index returned by indexOf will be lower then the i
[03:05:04] <Cork> so it gets removed
[03:05:14] <LavaFlake> yeah which will be !true
[03:05:19] <Cork> ya
[03:05:27] <LavaFlake> so much more elegant
[03:05:43] <LavaFlake> thanks again and for taking the time to make sure i understood what was going on :D
[04:02:22] <Nyrox> Hello :)
[04:46:31] <exactp> for some reason I can't seem to do this right.  I'm trying to pass data through $.ajax using data:{usr: $(this).val()} but I keep getting internal server error
[04:47:06] <exactp> In the php document I'm just request is via $_POST['usr'];
[04:47:39] <exactp> if I manually enter an example string the request outputs the data in the console fine
[04:47:41] <slax0r> 500 error is such a broad error, no one can really do anything with it, inspect the network(to see if params are sent), inspect server logs, to actually see what's wrong, and so on
[04:50:21] <exactp> error_log doesn't ahve anything
[04:50:46] <exactp> I'm looking at the waterfall if net in ff and it only shows the 500 error
[04:51:00] <slax0r> do you have your error_reporting set to E_ALL or any other sensible debuging value?
[04:54:59] <exactp> No I did not but now I have more info
[04:55:01] <exactp> :)
[04:55:28] <exactp> well shit now I see
[04:55:34] <exactp> whoops...
[04:55:59] <slax0r> well, tell me, don't leave me in suspense, I want to know how I halped ^^
[04:56:12] <exactp> Got it
[04:56:18] <exactp> Yes you did
[04:56:38] <exactp> I figured it out I was binding a param of a non-object or trying to
[04:56:39] <exactp> :s
[04:57:03] <exactp> trying to bind a param f a string
[04:58:39] <slax0r> always remember: log files, if nothing there, turn up reporting levels
[04:59:41] <LavaFlake> I turn on everything by default in dev
[05:00:41] <Guest30> Someone an idea how I can update an existing google map styling?
[05:00:41] <exactp> tyvm you all
[05:00:43] <LavaFlake> no reason not to take care of the warnings in most cases
[05:01:04] <Guest30> I have  anew styles array and want to override the current one.
[05:54:00] <_lazarevsky> hey guys
[05:54:19] <_lazarevsky> I am looking for a selectbox jquery plugin which also allows for new list items to be added
[05:54:51] <_lazarevsky> so say for instance you click the dropdown the first item is "+ Add a new product" and below it, it lists the current products
[05:55:20] <_lazarevsky> if the user click the first item (+), it changes to input field with a save button adjacent to it
[05:56:02] <_lazarevsky> anyone got any ideas?"
[05:56:03] <_lazarevsky> thanks
[06:07:24] <_lazarevsky> umm.. anyone?
[06:43:23] <Cork> _lazarevsky: i don't think you will find a ready made plugin for that
[06:43:37] <Cork> _lazarevsky: though you could extend jquery ui autocomplete to do that
[06:51:27] <_lazarevsky> Cork: ya I'll just build a custom component
[06:51:47] <_lazarevsky> when the option "add new product" is selected I'll be hiding the dropdown and will show the input instead
[07:00:13] <slax0r> _lazarevsky: how will you go back though?
[07:00:23] <slax0r> you need to have a cancel button, or some X icon somewhere
[07:00:58] <_lazarevsky> slax0r: ya of course I'll add an X next to the tick
[07:00:59] <_lazarevsky> :)
[07:05:53] <Uhkis> _lazarevsky: make it a new feature for chosen!
[07:06:15] <Uhkis> https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen this
[07:06:36] <_lazarevsky> I'll build a component for the Ember front-end framework :)
[07:06:41] <_lazarevsky> and share that
[07:06:47] <Uhkis> boo!
[07:20:25] <student_brussels> Hello, I am creating a search form with Ajax but it does not work if someone can help me discover my mistake, thank you
[07:30:02] <Cork> student_brussels: just ask the question
[07:30:16] <Cork> don't ask for someone just ask and if someone has time they will look at it
[07:31:48] <student_brussels> Cork I create my view with my form, I have a function postsearch in the controller of my view, I have code un <script> ... but it does not work
[07:32:06] <student_brussels> Cork I follow a tutorial
[07:32:15] <Cork> student_brussels: that is way to little info for anyone to help you
[07:32:28] <Cork> for a starter, add the related code in a jsfiddle
[07:32:32] <Cork> and post the link here
[07:33:17] <student_brussels> Cork it's just that it's probably easiest to see my code
[08:16:39] <gutenachtsteph> hi, I've a jquery question. i submit a form which includes a checkbox. it's important that the "on" value of the checkbox is included in the form data. problem is, that in the moment, when I submit the form (via a button), I need to disable the Checkbox (double-click-avoid, and I don't want to use click=false). do you know any chance how to manipulate the value of a checkbox, even if it's disabled?
[08:17:56] <Cork> gutenachtsteph: you can manipulate the value of a checkbox if it is disabled
[08:18:13] <Cork> the disabled is the display value and if it should be included in the post
[08:18:37] <Cork> so, ya you shouldn't disable the checkbox before you submit if you want to submit it
[08:18:39] <gutenachtsteph> just e.g. $['#checkbox'].attr('value','on') ?
[08:18:48] <Cork> uh, what?
[08:18:51] <gutenachtsteph> hm
[08:19:09] <Cork> the value of the checkbox is submitted if the checkbox isn't disabled, and is checked
[08:19:14] <Cork> if it isn't checked it isn't submitted
[08:20:43] <gutenachtsteph> thank you a lot
[08:27:15] <Mark___> does anybody know how i can simplify these codes? im afraid my website will go to crash,cause there are too many of the repeated tasks. http://imgur.com/7xYXGEw
[08:46:05] <Cork> uh... wow really??
[08:46:47] <Cork> he's separating commands with comma??
[08:48:07] <robhol> what the actual fuck
[08:49:59] <DasSaffe> morning cats. Simple question regarding the wrapAll() stuff. I read a question on StackOverflow, but for some reason, this here isn't working as expected. http://jsfiddle.net/qraay6q2/ Someone an idea?
[08:50:44] <Cork> DasSaffe: those divs aren't siblings
[08:50:46] <DasSaffe> to be more specific: it isn't wrapping anyhting after the 3rd diff
[08:50:48] <DasSaffe> *div
[08:51:27] <Cork> you don't close the divs so all of those divs are children of the earlier ones
[08:51:46] <Cork> also jsfiddle shouldn't have <body> in the html section
[08:52:08] <DasSaffe> @Cork I tried the selector ('.filter-container .w-col') as well, but still the same result :/
[08:52:24] <Cork> DasSaffe: ya, cause you can't wrap when all of them are siblings
[08:52:27] <Cork> like i just said
[08:52:35] <DasSaffe> ooh i see
[08:52:50] <Cork> uh...
[08:52:52] <DasSaffe> hmm..
[08:52:56] <Cork> sorry when none of them are siblings
[08:53:21] <Cork> hit the tidy button in the toolbar, it will make it more clear
[08:53:41] <DasSaffe> oh my... yeah
[08:53:45] <DasSaffe> i know what you mean ...
[08:53:48] <DasSaffe> gimme a sec
[08:53:55] <DasSaffe> darn..
[09:08:41] <DasSaffe> @Cork so I checked it, but still no effect: http://jsfiddle.net/qraay6q2/1/ correct childs (from what I am seeing) and the jq-part seems to be okay as well
[09:09:07] <DasSaffe> any other ideas what might cause the problem?
[09:10:11] <Cork> DasSaffe: you still aren't closing the divs...
[09:11:19] <DasSaffe> which one isn't closed? did it updated the code?
[09:11:47] <Cork> DasSaffe: you open 3, then close one, then open 3, and close one
[09:12:39] <Cork> DasSaffe: the tidy doesn't fix the broken html, it indents it so you see what the parser sees
[09:12:49] <Cork> you still have to fix it
[09:13:12] <DasSaffe> yeah you are right, I'm still trying to figure out where I missed it. Only the "first" div seems to be unclosed (I close 2 btw:)
[09:13:24] <DasSaffe> but for some reason, one <div> isn't placed in a new line
[09:13:31] <DasSaffe> even after using the tidy-thigny
[09:13:46] <Cork> DasSaffe: take http://jsfiddle.net/qraay6q2/
[09:13:56] <Cork> all the divs except the outer most div isn't closed
[09:15:27] <DasSaffe> check the string "testausgabe". one closing div is placed behind it. Let me tidy this mess a bit up
[09:15:33] <DasSaffe> that's a torture to read, hold on
[09:15:37] <billj5> is it possible using a selector only (no filter) to pick all elements that DO NOT have a certain string in their style attribute (specificly display: none;)
[09:15:56] <DasSaffe> something like :visible ?
[09:16:14] <Cork> billj5: you shouldn't select based on css values
[09:16:26] <Cork> give it a class and control it by that
[09:16:35] <Cork> (or the absense of the class)
[09:16:38] <DasSaffe> billj5 $('.myClass:visible'); would be a way, but ^ is right
[09:16:55] <Cork> ^ that is just asking jquery to hide the filter loop
[09:17:07] <Cork> as it has to check css('display')
[09:17:59] <billj5> ah ok, ty guys :)
[09:20:05] <DasSaffe> ffs
[09:21:50] <billj5> how is querySelector faster if jquery uses querySelector?  https://jsperf.com/jquery-vs-document-queryselector
[09:22:17] <DasSaffe> now it should be better Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/qraay6q2/4/ at least readable
[09:23:41] <Cork> DasSaffe: and there you go http://jsfiddle.net/qraay6q2/5/
[09:28:27] <DasSaffe> did you change something Cork? in the JS?
[09:28:37] <Cork> nope
[09:28:53] <Cork> when you fixed the html so it had siblings it worked
[09:29:14] <DasSaffe> it isn't workign for me.. wtf
[09:29:28] <Cork> you mean the /5/ isn't working?
[09:30:56] <DasSaffe> couldn't see a diffrence betweetn 4 and 5 :? the thing is, this shitty html is generated via typoscript
[09:31:17] <Cork> DasSaffe: i added jquery to the jsfiddle in 5
[09:31:31] <DasSaffe> oh, okay. Yeah, but still not working
[09:31:43] <Cork> in /5/ ?
[09:31:49] <Cork> the elements are added just fine
[09:31:55] <Cork> no visible change though
[09:32:54] <DasSaffe> i see another error ... for some reason: divs = null; doesn't nullify the div-var
[09:33:04] <DasSaffe> deleted divs; neither
[09:33:14] <Cork> uh
[09:33:22] <Cork> you don't have any null in that code
[09:33:33] <DasSaffe> yeah havn't updated, gimme a sec
[09:33:59] <DasSaffe> http://jsfiddle.net/qraay6q2/6/ there u go
[09:34:22] <DasSaffe> oh i see, i think i know whats wrong.. it's var divs right?
[09:34:26] <Cork> uh you first create a global divs with the value null
[09:34:41] <Cork> then you create a local divs variable containing the matching elements
[09:34:51] <Cork> and what should the point of this be?
[09:35:03] <DasSaffe> Okay, you know "quicksand"?
[09:35:09] <DasSaffe> this sorting-thingy for jQuery?
[09:38:07] <DasSaffe> nvm, I'm retarded ... forget my question ... apparently it isn't enough to write valid code ... you should call it in the right spot as well ...
[09:39:31] <zagaza-> hi guys.. when you hover the pagination items below the image here, they expand to the active class size. http://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/1pr9zovu/    when I hover the other pagination items that are not currently active, I want the active class item to get minimized to the dot size. But I'm not quite sure how to do it properly. Anyone got a suggestion?
[09:40:57] <Cork> zagaza-: you could ignore the active class if the .pagination is hovered
[09:41:08] <Cork> but that is about the best i can think of
[09:41:53] <zagaza-> hmm sounds like a good idea, how do I just "ignore" it though? like toggleClass?
[09:41:57] <Cork> zagaza-: http://jsfiddle.net/1pr9zovu/1/
[09:42:24] <Cork> with js you can do it cleaner
[09:42:32] <zagaza-> damn that's awesome Cork :) didn't think you could do it in just css
[09:42:44] <Cork> :)
[09:42:48] <Cork> css ftw
[09:42:57] <DasSaffe> said no one ever
[09:43:05] <DasSaffe> css ... buwargh
[09:43:39] <zagaza-> hehe
[09:45:12] <robhol> [      I LOVE C]SS
[09:46:47] <Stummi> Only thing I miss in CSS are arithmetical expressions, like "width: 100% - 20px"
[09:46:59] <Cork> zagaza-: this is the js alternative http://jsfiddle.net/1pr9zovu/2/
[09:47:32] <DasSaffe> When CSS is able to calc and every browser supports it, there is almost no need for JS anymore
[09:48:05] <Cork> true
[09:48:21] <Cork> animate and transition handles most of the js needs now days
[09:48:31] <Cork> well for visual effects at least
[09:48:42] <Cork> there are still loads of other things that need js
[09:48:59] <DasSaffe> all I can think of is ajax and some manipulation
[09:49:09] <DasSaffe> but not that much anymore
[09:49:37] <Cork> well collapsing areas when you click an arrow for example
[09:49:49] <Cork> or inline filtering
[09:50:04] <Cork> and loads of other things
[09:50:21] <Cork> but it is feature adding, not just having the page change how it looks
[09:51:03] <zagaza-> neat thanks Cork
[09:51:14] <Cork> np
[09:51:26] <zagaza-> the biggest problem I had Cork, was to applying the active class to another item on click
[09:51:38] <zagaza-> the other items bugged out completely for me somehow
[09:53:22] <Cork> zagaza-: http://jsfiddle.net/1pr9zovu/3/
[09:53:49] <Cork> the biggest problem i see is the hit area of the inactive buttons
[09:54:05] <zagaza-> thanks
[09:54:06] <zagaza-> yeah
[09:54:26] <zagaza-> $(this).closest('ul').toggleClass('js', event.type == 'mouseenter');    I'm pretty new with js as you can tell.. what class are you actually toggling here? .js ?
[09:54:34] <zagaza-> ah yeah I see now
[09:54:50] <Cork> zagaza-: the event handler handles both enter and leave
[09:54:56] <Cork> and if it isn't enter remove the class
[09:55:05] <Cork> (and vise versa)
[09:55:40] <hellyeah> yo
[09:55:47] <zagaza-> cool
[09:56:44] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Shouldn't everything that goes below e.preventDefault() function just fine? jQuery UI's draggable ui.position isn't being applies if there's an e.preventDefault before/ after the call. It's weird..
[09:56:55] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> And it seems to be the only way to cancel a drag
[09:57:31] <Cork> Zero_Zip_Zilch: there is an accept handler
[09:58:20] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Cork, an accept handler for what? (What should I search for?)
[09:58:43] <Cork> Zero_Zip_Zilch: http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#option-accept
[09:58:53] <Cork> Function: A function that will be called for each draggable on the page (passed as the first argument to the function). The function must return true if the draggable should be accepted.
[10:00:43] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Oh, aight. But it's not for drop; it's so that if the box touches certain elements, its position is reset to start and there I want to cancel the drag, cus otherwise I can just keep dragging it after the position has been reset
[10:02:26] <printForever> I have an email field shown in a lightbox, and I have a script that clears input[type="email"] on .focus()
[10:02:35] <printForever> problem is, that script does not work with lightbox
[10:03:19] <printForever> it works fine when the regular page is shown
[10:03:26] <runtyrobot> I need to replace a unicode error in a series of labels - where æ, ø and å are replace by the unicode equivalents like "u00f8" - I've tried quite a few things now - but unsuccesfully. Any ideas?
[10:03:34] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> I'm thinking of just removing the element and re-creating it. But that's a tiny bit of a hassle. But it works if there's no other way to reset the position and cancel the drag
[10:03:40] <printForever> and also works fine when I call the Lightbox and show the field, and then run the code in the Console.
[10:04:10] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> printForever, do you have multiple forms on the page?
[10:04:19] <printForever> no
[10:04:22] <printForever> just 1
[10:04:56] <printForever> Zero_Zip_Zilch, and the email field is already on the page, but its hidden.
[10:05:50] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> printForever, so you don't have one form on the regular page, and one in the lightbox?
[10:06:03] <printForever> its the same form
[10:06:11] <printForever> its already on the page display: none;
[10:06:16] <printForever> lightbox is just showing it
[10:06:38] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Oh aight. So when you hijack it in the inspector and try it it works?
[10:06:47] <printForever> yes
[10:07:45] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Make sure lightbox isn't creating any extra classes or something
[10:07:55] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> When you open it up. I'm not sure exactly how that plugin works
[10:08:13] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> But then on the other hand, I don't know if that'd matter
[10:09:34] <printForever> It is creating additional marku.
[10:09:59] <printForever> It is creating additional markup, but that is not the problem? Since I've delcared input[type="email"] to be cleared on focus.
[10:10:09] <printForever> Also, I've checked the field type is email.
[10:12:15] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> I mean, this is a super long shot, but try using $('some-static-selector').on("focus", selector, handler)
[10:15:15] <printForever> Zero_Zip_Zilch http://pastebin.com/r5VRGxHu
[10:16:26] <printForever> Is there a way to tie it in with the Lightbox. So when the lightbox is triggered it "retrigger" the script again?
[10:17:43] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> I'm not sure. There probably is but that's outside of my domain. I'd check what "this" outputs though
[10:25:41] <tehopeologist> if i import an html file inside a react app, could i use jquery to traverse the dom inside that file to get for example text from a node?
[10:28:08] <runtyrobot> I need to replace a unicode error in a series of labels - where æ, ø and å are replace by the unicode equivalents like "u00f8" - I've tried quite a few things now - but unsuccesfully. Any ideas?
[10:28:39] <printForever> Zero_Zip_ZilchI tried... Does not work.
[10:28:43] <Tennis> could you put one of those meta tags in the html
[10:28:54] <printForever> taplar, are you here?
[10:29:05] <Tennis> make it like utf-8 if thats one of the things that includes those symbols runtyrobot
[10:31:00] <printForever> Tennis
[10:31:06] <printForever> do you have an idea how to solve this?
[10:31:40] <Tennis> I didnt see your issue, was just responding to runtyrobot
[10:31:59] <printForever> Well, long story short. Input .val clear does not work with Lightbox
[10:32:27] <Tennis> setting the input to nothing doesn't take effect?
[10:32:33] <printForever>  I have an email field shown in a lightbox, and I have a script that clears input[type="email"] on .focus() problem is, that script does not work with lightbox it works fine when the regular page is shown. and also works fine when I call the Lightbox and show the field, and then run the code in the Console.
[10:32:36] <Tennis> hmmm
[10:32:44] <printForever> yeah... nothing
[10:32:59] <printForever> only if I run the script in the console, after Lightbox is triggered, it works
[10:33:46] <Tennis> no errors in the console?
[10:34:11] <printForever> nope
[10:34:12] <printForever> all good
[10:34:48] <Tennis> I'm not sure, sorry. If you get a fiddle going holla and i'll try too
[10:36:08] <billj5> how is querySelector faster if jquery uses querySelector?  https://jsperf.com/jquery-vs-document-queryselector
[10:39:30] <NoiseEee> presumably because a jquery object doesn't need to be created first?
[10:39:59] <NoiseEee> now, is the speed noticed in real-life?  i'd say 'no chance'
[10:42:24] <billj5> NoiseEee: k , ty
[10:43:37] <hellyeah> when you hover the circular button some part of button i didnt see how can i fix it is there a js way or is it css?   http://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/160/
[10:46:26] <billj5> set the opacity to less than 1?
[10:46:49] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:46:59] <hellyeah> is that the reason?
[10:47:03] <billj5> I think so
[10:47:16] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:47:28] <billj5> http://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/161/
[10:48:07] <billj5> oh but you dont want it to be that same opacity
[10:48:12] <billj5> when you hover
[10:48:14] <hellyeah> yes
[10:48:19] <billj5> maybe z-index?
[10:48:26] <hellyeah> hmm can be
[10:48:38] <hellyeah> hmm seems it is css issue
[10:48:49] <hellyeah> i really need to wrap things up on css
[10:52:01] <hellyeah> thanks billj5
[10:52:56] <billj5> np
[11:34:10] <Mark___> im having bit of a problem implementing this on my website,can anyone help ? http://tympanus.net/Development/RainEffect/#slide-1
[11:52:32] <mrgt> Trying $(this).parent().trigger(‘click’); doesn’t seem to work. Am I doing something wrong?
[11:53:53] <NoiseEee> mrgt: crystal ball.... fuzzy
[11:55:55] <mrgt> Essentially my code can be stripped down to this and it’s not working. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fd05d6e5287802e244d6
[12:07:39] <billj5> a
[12:12:17] <mrgt> Is there a way to simulate a click event on the parent element?
[12:13:19] <Tennis> could you not put the click event on the parent?
[12:16:22] <NoiseEee> mrgt: that doesn't really help anyone to help you
[12:16:28] <NoiseEee> mrgt: make a working jsfiddle
[12:16:55] <NoiseEee> mrgt: but also, why are you trying to programatically click something?
[12:17:13] <NoiseEee> mrgt: why not just call the function that the 'click' calls directly?
[12:22:04] <mrgt> The child element lets me choose an image when I click on it. However, when the image is chosen I would like to show the parent item is ‘selected’. The parent item can be selected by it’s own click event which toggles a css class. Additionally, the selected parent lets me place a marker on another div. The marker is represented by the image I have chosen.
[12:23:56] <billj5> why dont u have the child click event toggle the parent css class?
[12:24:17] <billj5> and take care of the marker
[12:24:29] <NoiseEee> ^^
[12:24:35] <mrgt> NoiseEee: Although I take your point about triggering the same function that is called when the parent element is clicked.
[12:25:49] <billj5> click handler*
[12:42:35] <ul71m0> so i have few elements that share same data-date attribute.  I need to do some action on first element with that group. Here is my failed attempt: https://jsfiddle.net/6j1Lnhya/
[12:43:59] <taplar> ul71m0: your most likely after filter()
[12:44:11] <taplar> the data() returns a string, not an object
[12:45:08] <taplar> $dates.filter('[data-date]').eq(0)
[12:45:42] <taplar> though i'm wondering why you would do the filter, as you already have the class
[12:47:17] <ul71m0> taplar: thanks for hint, i tried that but it works only for first one
[12:47:40] <taplar> so are you wanting to do that per data value grouping?
[12:47:48] <ul71m0> yes
[12:47:50] <taplar> gotcha
[12:47:56] <ul71m0> every frist date of its kind needs to be red ;)
[12:50:10] <sigdk> hello. I'm using a modal on which appears a window with steps. How can I clean up the state of the window after I close the modal ?  Currently when I'm in the 2nd step out of 5, if I close the window and re-click the button that opens it, what I see is the 2nd step. I'd like to start from 1... any hints ?
[12:52:00] <taplar> ul71m0: one approach https://jsfiddle.net/6j1Lnhya/1/
[12:52:43] <taplar> if they're all sorted though you could possibly keep track of the data values and when they change apply the color
[12:52:52] <taplar> would be less filters
[12:54:45] <ul71m0> taplar: well that is actually slider and i need to show only first dates so it looks like grouping, but somehow your code works on fiddle but doesnt work in my example ;(
[12:55:20] <ul71m0> Let me try to find where is issue, maybe this bx slider makes problems with its clons
[12:55:30] <ul71m0> taplar++
[12:55:33] <ul71m0> taplar:  thanks :)
[12:55:40] <taplar> np
[12:57:13] <taplar> sigdk: are you using a plugin to do your steps?
[12:59:08] <lc23> can some one tell me if my jqurey is not right under the submit http://pastebin.com/SFqEWB7x
[12:59:25] <sigdk> taplar, yes
[12:59:48] <sigdk> taplar, http://www.jquery-steps.com/
[13:00:00] <taplar> k, and are you using jqueryui for the dialog?
[13:01:26] <sigdk> what do you mean for the dialog ?
[13:01:42] <taplar> you said your steps are in a modal
[13:02:22] <sigdk> yes
[13:02:36] <taplar> are you using a plugin for that?
[13:03:39] <taplar> logically you'd want to bind on a close method, if one exists, and do the logic to reset the steps back to the first one.  so I'm trying to see if I can find anything in the documentation of any plugins your using
[13:05:07] <sigdk> taplar, this is the plugin I'm using for the modal: http://leanmodal.finelysliced.com.au/   are there more ?
[13:06:37] <taplar> looking now.  documentation on that guy is sparse
[13:07:24] <taplar> ok, from what i can tell there isn't a close event that you can bind to
[13:07:35] <taplar> so you'll want to bind on the click event of the close element
[13:07:41] <taplar> and in that do something
[13:07:54] <taplar> i found this talking about resetting steps: https://github.com/rstaib/jquery-steps/issues/26
[13:10:51] <sigdk> taplar, so, I should reset it every time I open a new window (?)
[13:11:14] <taplar> when ever makes logical sense to your use case
[13:13:23] <sigdk> taplar, can I move manually to a previous step ?
[13:13:35] <sigdk> I mean... through code
[13:13:51] <sigdk> If it opens at the 2nd step (actually I have only 2) send it back
[13:13:55] <taplar> that appears to be what that goToStep() is doing
[13:15:38] <taplar> assuming the 0 is the step index, technically you could use that function to go forwards or backwards
[13:22:20] <lc23> can some one help me a jqurey submit to a sharepoint list  http://pastebin.com/SFqEWB7x
[13:30:32] <jquery272> Can anyone here help me with a jquery/ajax question?
[13:31:21] <jonah> Hi can anyone help me get this page so when you click a page it goes to the right one. I'm using turn.js and just not sure why it's not working right: http://newsite.outlook-trust.org.uk/issues-facing-older-people-today-sample.html#page/1
[13:32:27] <Visvalor> Jonah I'd need to see the source
[13:34:02] <jonah> Visvalor: here are my li's http://pastebin.com/jzBDeA4a
[13:35:17] <taplar> jonah: open your console and click the first page
[14:06:36] <mrgt> Can someone explain why storing $(this) as a variable prevents the toggleClass method from working? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ea4e5aa74f06e8f16872
[14:08:46] <taplar> should not be different
[14:09:44] <NoiseEee> mrgt:as mentioned before, its hard to help you if you don't provide working examples on jsFiddle or similar
[14:10:16] <NoiseEee> mrgt: often in the construction of the fiddle, you'll have an a-ha moment yourself
[14:12:46] <dcope> is it possible to detect a click on the body element if there are other elements laying over it?
[14:13:18] <taplar> the event should bubble up to the body if it is not cancelled
[14:15:49] <dcope> taplar: so i can check to see what element was clicked with event's currentTarget. why would == not work when comparing to $("body") ?
[14:16:52] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event
[14:17:00] <taplar> originalTarget should be what started the whole thing
[14:17:14] <dcope> there is no originalTarget
[14:17:27] <dcope> it's undefined
[14:17:33] <taplar> or target
[14:17:39] <taplar> looks like originalTarget is a moz thing
[14:18:07] <dcope> taplar: alright, but that still doesn't explain why the == operator doesn't work
[14:18:07] <dcope> :(
[14:18:15] <taplar> what's the statement?
[14:18:28] <dcope> event.currentTarget == $("body")
[14:18:38] <taplar> currentTarget most likely isn't a jquery object
[14:18:41] <dcope> event.currentTarget is the body element though
[14:18:42] <dcope> oh
[14:18:45] <taplar> you'd need to .get() the body
[14:18:55] <taplar> or [0]
[14:22:56] <dcope> hrm perhaps javascript isn't the right approach for this
[14:29:48] <sillyslux> from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener , whats the jquery equivalent for "useCapture"?
[14:30:47] <ul71m0> hey taplar the code you provided for making every first item works fine when i disable bx-slider, but when its on it shows only first one, i tried with bxslider callback onSliderLoad: function(), but no luck https://jsfiddle.net/6j1Lnhya/1/
[14:31:10] <ul71m0> do you have an idea why is that, im sure it is because slider load
[14:32:25] <sillyslux> found it.. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
[14:32:27] <taplar> console.log the $dates and see what you get
[14:32:45] <sillyslux> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17249125/event-capturing-jquery
[14:39:37] <ul71m0> taplar: im getting this https://www.dropbox.com/s/x3vnqbel3eq96ut/Screenshot%202015-11-23%2020.39.14.png?dl=0 looks like all values
[14:43:37] <sillyslux> dcope, maybe you can use that? like document.body.addEventListener('click',function(e){console.log('target is '+(e.target==document.body?'':'not ')+'body',e.target);/*e.cancelBubble=true;*/},true)
[14:43:43] <taplar> hmm, some reason my network isn't wanting to access that page
[15:11:20] <ul71m0> taplar: i get bunch of these http://pastie.org/10576640
[15:19:52] <adavia_> how can i access a class method from a different instance like in line 7 https://jsfiddle.net/q4kdzn01/
[15:42:41] <LindsayMac> So i'm trying to make a responsive image script that scales the image and inside a container to always hit the long edge of the container (similar to how background-size:cover does with BG images). Sometimes the images will need to be stretched because they're slightly smaller than the container size so the image file size isn't something I can count on.
[15:43:31] <LindsayMac> I am wondering if I do .height() on an image that is in a container, does it give me the image file size or the size that it is when its loaded in that container (meaning if it's width: 100%, it will give me the pixel dimentions of the stretched image)
[15:51:46] <taplar> LindsayMac: i would assume height() would give you the dimension of the element on the page
[16:08:07] <LindsayMac> Hm so I am going to have to figure out how to just grab the original file's aspect ratio at least
[16:09:16] <taplar> maybe grab it at the start before you manipulate it, or load it in an unmodified width height element positioned at like width: -10000px, heh
[16:09:28] <taplar> err left: -10000px
[16:09:57] <LindsayMac> taplar:  yea I thought about not adding any css on load and adding them  in my script
[16:10:02] <LindsayMac> (that alter width or height)
[16:10:10] <LindsayMac> but I wanted to make it fall back decently without JS
[16:14:01] <JohnDoe2> LindsayMac html5 has this thing called naturalWidth and naturalHeight but it's ... you know... IE9 and up.
[16:14:25] <LindsayMac> JohnDoe2:  i think I can be ok with IE9 and up...
[16:14:44] <LindsayMac> anyone on under IE8 is just.. well.. theyre SOL .. the site will work but not look as pretty, which tjhey MUST be used to by now
[16:14:59] <JohnDoe2> yup. So you can use .prop("") to grab it in jQuery if you wanted to
[16:15:08] <LindsayMac> JohnDoe2:  interesting ok!
[16:48:40] <jasonhamm> What does this mean in a bind method? $(map).bind('mouseover.maphilight, focus.maphilight', function(e) {});
[16:48:50] <jasonhamm> What is the mouseover.maphilight mean?
[16:50:12] <NoiseEee> does that actually work?
[16:50:58] <jasonhamm> @NoiseEee, if you are talking to me, then it does work
[16:51:19] <jasonhamm> If I take the .maphilight off of the event names, then the plugin does not work
[16:51:34] <NoiseEee> i didnt think one could listen for events that way
[16:51:35] <NoiseEee> but anyways
[16:51:38] <NoiseEee> .bind() is old
[16:51:41] <NoiseEee> but...
[16:51:42] <jasonhamm> I know
[16:51:58] <jasonhamm> I am trying to convert a jquery plugin to vanilla js, so I just want to understand it
[16:52:41] <NoiseEee> its saying to apply the function to elements within the 'map' DOM reference with the event listed and the class 'maphighlight'
[16:53:07] <jasonhamm> That is what I assumed, but I must be missing something
[16:53:15] <jasonhamm> I can't find any element with the class on it
[16:53:23] <NoiseEee> what is map?
[16:53:43] <jasonhamm> An image map
[16:53:46] <jasonhamm> So it is really an image
[16:53:54] <NoiseEee> jesus what do you mean by image map
[16:53:57] <NoiseEee> like from 1990s ?
[16:54:01] <jasonhamm> Yep
[16:54:13] <NoiseEee> can you make a fiddle?
[16:54:20] <NoiseEee> curious though
[16:54:33] <jasonhamm> I can try, but before I do, what can I use other than an image map?
[16:54:44] <jasonhamm> Is there an easier way to do the same thing?
[16:54:53] <jasonhamm> I could trash this whole project
[16:55:20] <NoiseEee> im not sure tbh
[16:55:30] <NoiseEee> maybe its still a valid thing, i just haven't seen it since literally the 1990s
[16:55:36] <jasonhamm> I googled everywhere and couldn't find anything else
[16:55:50] <jasonhamm> I am pulling this into a React component
[16:56:13] <NoiseEee> looks like they are still legit
[16:56:17] <jasonhamm> Last thing I want to do is spend this time to make something out of a technology that has been replaced
[16:56:28] <jasonhamm> That is the same thing I saw
[16:57:06] <NoiseEee> go for it then :)
[16:57:11] <jasonhamm> lol
[17:02:37] <jasonhamm> @NoiseEee - Can you look at this plugin and see if you can find where .maphilight is being added?
[17:02:37] <jasonhamm> https://github.com/kemayo/maphilight/blob/master/jquery.maphilight.js
[17:03:26] <jasonhamm> I see where .maphilighted is being added, but not .maphilight
[17:03:35] <jasonhamm> I am hoping you can see what I am missing
[17:05:01] <NoiseEee> is that script creating the image map too?
[17:06:11] <NoiseEee> seems like maphighlight is a function
[17:06:40] <NoiseEee> line 216 but too many lines for me and I need to finish something in the next 24 minnutes
[17:07:03] <jasonhamm> Thats fine
[17:07:06] <jasonhamm> Thanks for looking
[17:07:10] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[17:07:24] <NoiseEee> line 192
[17:07:41] <NoiseEee> its a property thats a function
[17:08:26] <jasonhamm> Got it
[17:08:31] <jasonhamm> That makes sense.
[17:08:37] <jasonhamm> Sorry to bother you when you are busy
[17:09:43] <NoiseEee> no worries
[17:59:45] <Tentacled> Hello people! So here I am wondering. I found an AJAX validator for my form, but their docs say I should:  $("#form").submit(function() { event.preventDefault() do_some_ajax_callback( function() { form.submit(); } ) })   - that is, intercept the form's submit method... but then, on success, call .submit() again. Won't it recurse..?
[18:19:36] <derstrom> Tentacled: If by that you mean attempting to submit the form dynamically will not work because of preventDefault(), I think so yes
[18:20:26] <derstrom> because even if you submit a form dynamically, the same event is being fired
[18:20:33] <derstrom> so the same code is being fired
[18:25:41] <odigity> I can't figure out how to get the contents of a <template> tag.  When I run $('template#foo').html(), it returns the html with the < and > chars replaced by &lt; and &gt;
[18:47:59] <mikeliss> Anybody know why slideUp would be jumpy? It seems to do nothing, but then when the duration ends, the whole node disappears.
[18:48:40] <mikeliss> This is the code, more or less: https://gist.github.com/mlissner/bfdbb6f31d98c7fb218d
[18:58:13] <mikeliss> I got it. It's a table row I'm trying to slide up. Natch, it doesn't obey the laws of heights, and it fails.
[19:13:12] <drej> mikeliss: a table row/cell cannot clip its contents as per the box model
[19:13:32] <drej> so what you're running into (liekly) is the font size is preventing you from making it any smaller than a single line of height
[19:13:38] <drej> you can potentially set font-size to 0
[19:13:40] <drej> and see if that helps
[19:13:50] <mikeliss> @drej, I just went ahead and used fadeOut instead.
[19:13:54] <drej> that works
[19:13:57] <mikeliss> Seemed to do the trick.
[19:14:15] <mikeliss> Just needed the user to know something had happened. Computers these days are too fast sometimes.
[19:14:53] <adavia_> is there anyway i can access Upload.render_errors() from this form object.. line 17 http://pastie.org/10576983

[21:47:49] <printForever> is it possible to simulate a click on a A tag with jQuery?
[21:48:03] <printForever> I have Facebook share button in an iframe
[21:48:08] <printForever> and it's imposible to style it
[21:48:19] <printForever> so I thought to hide it and show a dummy button
[21:48:44] <printForever> once the dummy button is clicked, it will act as the real one was
[21:48:51] <printForever> is it possible to do this?
[21:50:31] <cannap> trigger
[21:50:42] <printForever> like?
[21:50:45] <exactp> I'm loading values into input text fields via ajax via php.  the php document odoes a query and json_encodes the query's array.  The values are passed back and inserted into the text fields by .val() - this is a form so values are loaded from a user table and i'm trying to make them editable. For some reason the .val values overwrite the values I change from what is loaded.
[21:50:55] <printForever> cannap, how to do it?
[21:51:16] <cannap> $(selector).trigger("click");
[21:51:23] <cannap> or wait this was events
[21:51:23] <cannap> or
[21:51:28] <exactp> say after I submit the form with new values in the input text fields
[21:51:39] <cannap> try it
[21:51:48] <printForever> but what will be the selector
[21:51:56] <printForever> and what trigger has to do with "click"?
[21:52:02] <cannap> its for events
[21:52:09] <cannap> i think this is wrong
[21:52:10] <printForever> ok. the selector can be my dummy A tag.
[21:52:13] <cannap> this will trigger and event
[21:52:15] <exactp> I feel like that is what is happening. it may not be :s
[21:52:29] <cannap> try the  rigger
[21:52:33] <cannap> trigger
[21:52:43] <printForever> ok
[21:52:47] <cannap> but i dont if the browser will go to this link
[21:52:48] <printForever> but "what is trigger"
[21:52:59] <printForever> I cant just say "click"
[21:53:02] <exactp> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[21:53:15] <cannap> you want to trigger something with something other
[21:53:31] <printForever> yes
[21:53:48] <printForever> click on a dummy A tag, to initiate Facebook Share
[21:54:04] <printForever> because I cant style Facebook share button since its inside iFrame
[21:57:11] <cannap> lol you can
[21:57:26] <printForever> no I can't
[21:57:33] <cannap> make you own button
[21:57:34] <printForever> I tried everything for the last 4 hours
[21:57:36] <cannap> with the same link
[21:57:39] <exactp> ^
[21:57:41] <printForever> yes, that is what I'm doing
[21:57:49] <cannap> but the popup?

[21:59:06] <printForever> cannap its the same thing they are showing here https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button
[21:59:11] <printForever> the problem is I cant style it
[21:59:17] <rcyr> printForever: You just create a link with http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=[URL]&title=[TITLE]
[21:59:20] <printForever> once its loaded on the page
[21:59:29] <printForever> OMG

[21:59:33] <rcyr> printForever: Then you can style that link the way you want.

[21:59:42] <printForever> WTF! Facebook! WTF!
[21:59:45] <cannap> 4h wasted
[21:59:49] * printForever gives rcyr a beer
[21:59:51] <rcyr> printForever: You will need JS if you want to open it in a popup window though.
[22:00:01] <printForever> I don't care
[22:00:01] <exactp> Can anyone let me know if I insert values into a form's input text fields from ajax using val via jquery does that overwrite the channges I make to the form's input text fields once I submit the form
[22:00:11] <rcyr> printForever: You would just use window.open... with that same URL
[22:00:11] <printForever> I just want to redirect the user to Facebook
[22:00:15] <printForever> and then its their problem
[22:00:39] <cannap> you cant fake clicks
