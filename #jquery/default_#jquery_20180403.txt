[07:16:48] <ghjklghjkl> hello
[09:19:55] <Serg_Penguin> hi! How can I write my custom attribute extractor, to be able to do $('.day[textContent="3"]') ?
[09:20:39] <RonaldsMazitis> hello
[09:20:42] <RonaldsMazitis> https://github.com/yckart/jquery.unevent.js
[09:20:46] <RonaldsMazitis> this thing does not work
[09:21:07] <RonaldsMazitis> I'm using     http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js
[09:21:07] <Cork> Serg_Penguin: check :contains()
[09:21:12] <Serg_Penguin> or, better for performance, $('.day:contains(3)').filter('[textContent="3"]')
[09:21:12] <RonaldsMazitis> thouhht
[09:21:37] <Cork> Serg_Penguin: though i recommend against it, it is quite slow to select based on content
[09:23:10] <RonaldsMazitis> why my unevent does not work
[09:23:20] <Serg_Penguin> Cork, I already wrote :textContent(), it test only for equality, but I want to bend it into pseudo attribute extractor, to enable all kinds of comparisons
[09:23:24] <Cork> RonaldsMazitis: define "does not work"
[09:24:15] <Cork> Serg_Penguin: as far as i remember you can only create functions for the query parser
[09:24:33] <RonaldsMazitis> it supposed to give console
[09:24:53] <RonaldsMazitis>     console.log(e.type + '-event was 250ms not triggered');
[09:25:07] <Cork> Serg_Penguin: [] is handled by querySelectorAll, so jquery doesn't have to do anything with it
[09:25:34] <Serg_Penguin> Cork, $('.day:textContent(3)') -> $('.day[textContent^="Hello"]')
[09:26:00] <Serg_Penguin> Cork, so my later wish is provably impossible ?
[09:26:15] <Cork> well kinda ya
[09:26:38] <Cork> you could write it as :f("^", "") or something like that
[09:27:19] <Cork> Serg_Penguin: but ya, it is a selection solution you should avoid for several reasons anyway
[09:27:44] <Cork> (except if you run it very rarely and on fairly small pages)
[09:27:55] <RonaldsMazitis> why after 250 ms nothing shows on console
[09:28:04] <Serg_Penguin> Cork, and there are no comparison parser in jQuery, since it is in (), in C++ ?
[09:28:36] <Cork> Serg_Penguin: $().filter(function() { /* do what you want return true or false if you want to keep it */  })
[09:29:06] <Cork> cause that is what those functions does anyway
[09:29:34] <Serg_Penguin> Cork, indeed I know, I just wanted terser and more beautiful expression
[09:30:15] <Cork> Serg_Penguin: the big problem is if ppl start using it in things like $(window).on('resize') cause they don't realize it is very slow
[09:30:21] <Cork> and the page goes to a crawl
[09:30:25] <Cork> (or on keydown or input)
[09:30:52] <Cork> it is normally better to make it visible when something does slow work so ppl can be careful with it
[09:31:19] <Serg_Penguin> Cork, aha, I got you
[09:31:48] <RonaldsMazitis> why jquery.enevent does not work
[09:32:49] <Cork> RonaldsMazitis: like i said, define "does not work"
[09:33:06] <RonaldsMazitis> damn console log does not log anything
[09:33:20] <RonaldsMazitis> how else should that piece of code work
[09:33:37] <RonaldsMazitis> console.log(e.type + '-event was 250ms not triggered');
[09:35:38] <RonaldsMazitis> resize work, I need scroll event
[09:36:57] <FilipNortic> RonaldsMazitis: that project hasn't been updated for 4 years. Have you used it before?
[09:37:37] <RonaldsMazitis> so how do I check for scrolling not happening
[09:40:27] <RonaldsMazitis> https://gomakethings.com/detecting-when-a-visitor-has-stopped-scrolling-with-vanilla-javascript/
[09:40:32] <RonaldsMazitis> this does not work ether
[09:41:16] <Cork> RonaldsMazitis: page scrolling is becomming more and more an async feature of modern browsers, you are better of not depending on it
[09:41:37] <RonaldsMazitis> http://kopigaischats.servebeer.com/
[09:42:28] * Cork starts to wonder if the responses is even read...
[09:42:35] <RonaldsMazitis> when a lot of stuff has been wrote there, the thing does    document.getElementById('chat-area').scrollTop = document.getElementById('chat-area').scrollHeight;
[09:43:13] <RonaldsMazitis> so it does not allow to scroll and look to messages posted before
[09:43:59] <RonaldsMazitis> I need it to do that only if You are not scrolling

[09:57:41] <lilalinux> I'm running multiple "const promiseN = $.ajax({url: ...});" and synchronize them via "await Promise.all([promise1, promise2, ...]);". How can I get the results of all requests afterwards?
[09:58:13] <dimi1947> how am I going to targert input whose name attribute is in one case form[0][service] and the other form[1][service]...?
[09:58:39] <Cork> dimi1947: $('input[name="form[1][service]"]')
[09:59:09] <dimi1947> Cork:I target only one of them with the above code
[09:59:11] <Cork> lilalinux: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all#Examples
[09:59:27] <RonaldsMazitis>     var $this = $(this);
[09:59:27] <Cork> ah, you can't really target partial names
[09:59:31] <Cork> give them a class
[09:59:40] <RonaldsMazitis> how do I choose concrete div
[09:59:50] <dimi1947> Cork:I see
[09:59:53] <RonaldsMazitis> for example in stackoverflow
[09:59:59] <lilalinux> Cork: thx
[10:00:11] <Cork> lilalinux: np
[10:01:05] <Cork> dimi1947: an option (though i don't recommend it) is [name$="[service]"]
[10:01:49] <dimi1947> Cork:why you do not recommend it....it seems OK to me
[10:02:29] <Cork> dimi1947: as it check for a name that ends with [service] so form[0][extra][service] will match too
[10:02:44] <Cork> just to give an example
[10:03:29] <dimi1947> Cork:I understand...I will just take care that in my DOM will not have such an attribute
[10:04:26] <dimi1947> Cork:besides...it would be totally inconventient though...that is a 3 dimentional array
[10:04:55] <Cork> dimi1947: not really, it is just a string
[10:05:06] <Cork> some servers see it as an array, but it really isn't
[10:05:33] <dimi1947> Cork:anyway...it is complicated and would never use it...

[10:06:22] <RonaldsMazitis> how do I write this correctly
[10:10:04] <RonaldsMazitis> cmmon this should be easy
[10:10:11] <RonaldsMazitis> how do I select correct div
[10:11:21] <FilipNortic> by id with #. by  class with .
[10:13:19] <RonaldsMazitis> yeah and how do I do it in that code
[10:14:03] <FilipNortic> var $div =$("#divId");
[10:15:36] <FilipNortic> RonaldsMazitis: var $div =$("#divId");
[10:17:22] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/59c1ajtt/8/
[10:17:25] <RonaldsMazitis> something like this
[10:17:27] <RonaldsMazitis> ?
[10:18:03] <thykka> RonaldsMazitis, https://jsfiddle.net/59c1ajtt/11/
[10:18:31] <RonaldsMazitis> tnx
[10:19:11] <thykka> you can't just rename a few occurrences of a variable and expect it to work :P
[10:28:06] <z1haze> does .closest() find elements that are on the dom before the element calling closest()? regardless of where they are nested, etc
[10:28:27] <Cork> z1haze: no, it checks for the closest parent
[10:28:41] <Cork> (self or parent)
[10:28:45] <z1haze> damn
[10:28:49] <z1haze> that's what i thought
[10:29:10] <Cork> z1haze: there isn't really a way to check for "elements close no matter of dom structure"
[10:29:18] <Cork> especially as you have fixed and absolute elements
[10:29:28] <Cork> (and floats)
[10:29:44] <z1haze> i didnt mean visual representation
[10:29:56] <z1haze> just as they appear in the source
[10:30:17] <Cork> z1haze: you prob want something like $(this).closest('.wrapping-parent').find('target')
[10:30:34] <Cork> i use that one quite a lot
[10:30:40] <z1haze> yeah I know I will need to, but that sort of limits the reusability of a function im making
[10:30:45] <Cork> ex $(this).closets('tr').find('input')
[10:30:50] <z1haze> yeah thats what im doing now
[10:31:18] <Cork> there isn't really any other way to do it
[10:31:26] <z1haze> darn
[10:31:43] <Cork> normally it is done by giving the function the wrapping parent
[10:31:48] <Cork> and a selector for the target
[10:32:01] <Cork> like delegate works in .on
[10:34:15] <RonaldsMazitis> it shows that I stopped scrolling miliseconds after
[10:34:41] <RonaldsMazitis> data-scrollTimeout="750" should be bigger?
[10:38:10] <RonaldsMazitis> I set  data-scrollTimeout="14750" $(window).scrollEnd(function(){ 22000}
[10:38:15] <RonaldsMazitis> still same response
[10:48:19] <FilipNortic> RonaldsMazitis: $(window).scrollEnd(function(){ ...},22000);
[10:49:39] <RonaldsMazitis> does not make a change
[10:50:03] <RonaldsMazitis> it appears to give no timeout at all
[10:55:34] <RonaldsMazitis>     if ($container.data('data-scrollTimeout')) {
[10:55:46] <RonaldsMazitis> maybe this is how this line should be
[10:55:52] <RonaldsMazitis> I DON'T KNOW
[10:59:42] <FilipNortic> (window).scrollEnd(function(){console.log('stopped scrolling');}, 1000); should work if you didn't do any other changes
[11:00:30] <FilipNortic> and you chouldn't set the attribute there that just where the script checks if theere is a timeout on the stack
[11:02:54] <RonaldsMazitis> it's way too fast
[11:03:00] <RonaldsMazitis> I need atleast 5 seconds
[11:03:07] <RonaldsMazitis> after scrolling ended
[11:04:03] <RonaldsMazitis> why it alerts me when it should be waiting for timer
[11:05:43] <RonaldsMazitis> I set it it 9999
[11:05:55] <RonaldsMazitis> still alerts me in less than 1 sec
[11:10:59] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/cLysqk1z/6/
[11:11:57] <RonaldsMazitis> does not even work
[11:17:23] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/x1qhw0bc/3/
[11:17:26] <RonaldsMazitis> this one does
[11:20:24] <RonaldsMazitis> something with $container is incorrect
[11:24:31] <RonaldsMazitis> for some reason it alerts in wrong time
[11:24:37] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/59c1ajtt/17/
[11:25:00] <RonaldsMazitis> this works, but timeout in my page does not work
[11:33:25] <RonaldsMazitis> FilipNortic: I use same jquery same code but in real page, it alerts me instantly
[11:42:46] <RonaldsMazitis> sorry
[11:42:59] <RonaldsMazitis> I found that I was writing this code somewhere else
[11:43:06] <RonaldsMazitis> and forgot to delete it
[12:20:26] <lilalinux> What's the easiest way to automatically retrieve all results of a REST API that uses paging? The result contains startAt, maxResults, total. Can $.ajax automatically loop until everything is fetched?
[12:29:51] <robertmaxrees> lilalinux you'll have to loop it yourself.
[12:34:39] <lilalinux> :-( thx
[12:34:57] <robertmaxrees> lilalinux there's a really obvious question here tho
[12:35:08] <lilalinux> yes, I need all results :-)
[12:35:14] <robertmaxrees> why tho?
[12:35:19] <robertmaxrees> like, how many are we talking?
[12:35:23] <lilalinux> drawing a graph
[12:35:44] <robertmaxrees> you should probably push that logic server-side in that case.
[12:35:50] <robertmaxrees> to get the stats you need for the graph.
[12:35:57] <lilalinux> the server is a JIRA
[12:36:34] <robertmaxrees> what kind of graph are you building?
[12:38:44] <lilalinux> vis.js
[12:39:12] <robertmaxrees> lol

[15:43:21] <catbadger> i HATE jquery-ui
[15:45:38] <catbadger> minor versions should never introduce breaking changes.. D-:
[17:05:37] <catbadger> hey
[17:07:30] <Gh0st_Preacher> hello
[17:08:35] <catbadger> how do?
[17:09:37] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[17:09:40] <robertmaxrees> pretty standard at this point.
[17:10:02] <robertmaxrees> yourself?
[17:10:51] <catbadger> well i'm fostering a strong hatred for jqueryui at this moment, but otherwise pretty good.
[17:13:09] <catbadger> the original dev for this system decided to make all the menu systems lean on jqueryui tabs... now i'm upgrading jquery-ui to edge and things are exploding in the edge-cases.
[17:13:24] <robertmaxrees> what version to what version?
[17:13:38] <catbadger> ??? to 1.12.x
[17:14:01] <catbadger> lol there was evidence that he edited the minified code.
[17:15:15] <robertmaxrees> soooo not a jqui issue then ;)
[17:15:16] <robertmaxrees> gotcha
[17:15:30] <catbadger> yeah
[17:15:31] <catbadger> haha
[17:19:28] <catbadger> i would say it's an architectural problem
[17:20:10] <robertmaxrees> hah
[17:28:21] <gambl0re> hi robert
[17:28:24] <gambl0re> hows going?
