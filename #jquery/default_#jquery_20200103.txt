[04:19:54] <dimi1947> dropdown does not default to current year https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/v26gz7ay/6
[05:04:42] <Woet> dimi1947: why so difficult? just use .val()
[05:06:03] <dimi1947> the dropdown must default aytomatically to the current year...can this be done with val() as you say?
[07:49:03] <baako> Happy new year guys. Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday
[15:31:59] <bbert2> Hi im adding some stuff with .after(...)
[15:32:15] <bbert2> is there an easy way to get a handle on the .after stuff
[15:32:34] <bbert2> jqeury seem to return the thing Im adding .after to
[15:32:53] <bbert2> naturally as it composes things in that manner
[15:39:05] <pavonia> bbert2: Instead of $elem.after(newstuff) you could use $(newstuff).insertAfter($elem)
[15:44:35] <bbert2> pavonia, does insertAfter return the thing I added?
[15:44:52] <bbert2> I was going towards  .after(...).next().first()
[15:46:52] <pavonia> It should return whatever was matched before
[15:47:11] <bbert2> right, so similar to after  still cascades the first match
[15:51:02] <bbert2> ah ok insertAfter inserts after...lol
[15:51:16] <bbert2> yeah I was wrong to use after... it replaces everything after right?
[15:52:37] <pavonia> .after and .insertAfter are the same thing, AFAIK, just with arguments flipped
[16:04:40] <taplar> after and insertAfter do not replace every thing after the elements.  It's just specifying which side the element should be inserted on.
[16:04:54] <taplar> an "insert" doesn't replace anything
