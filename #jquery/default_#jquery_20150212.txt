[00:53:29] <Erwat> hey i noticed there's a parseInt and parseFloat function
[00:53:45] <Erwat> if i want to get "-830px" into a number should i use parseInt?
[00:54:03] <Erwat> im mainly asking maybe there's some hidden stuff that shouldn't be used
[00:55:43] <mask> this isn't a jQuery-specific question, but does anybody here have experience with loading large data sets (up to 10,000 rows from db) and filtering them on the client side? In a perfect world I would just load all the data from the database, and do live filtering on the client. Is this even possible to achieve?
[00:56:57] <Erwat> not quite what you're asking for but I analyzed a logfile of a few thousand lines yesterday in javascript
[00:57:14] <Erwat> didn't notice much of any execution time, so i would say that it should work
[00:57:24] <Erwat> but if you want to do this in a production application then i don't know
[01:10:17] <Azrael_-> hi
[01:11:01] <Azrael_-> i want to disable the click-event on a hyperlink without removing the event on the link. is this possible?
[01:12:12] <Omar-> Azrael_- e.preventDefault()
[01:12:32] <Azrael_-> Omar-: unfortunately i can't modify the called function
[01:12:44] <andrei1> hello ppl, can I have a callback after .append is done? (I saw it return a promise but it doesn't work how i need)
[01:12:59] <Azrael_-> it is a third party library which accepts a link-id and then hooks internal functions to it
[01:13:05] <Omar-> Azrael_- what do you mean? pls share your code
[01:13:16] <Uhkis> https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DINWfuNnpvg/VNqLp8ZHF6I/AAAAAAAATLM/jbf5yzNsCdo/w693-h843-no/stacloverflow%2Bjquery.png
[01:15:18] <Omar-> andrei1 .append is not async, so you can call any function after it to manipulate previously appended elements
[01:15:52] <Omar-> Uhkis ahaha old yet funny ;)
[01:16:15] <andrei1> Omar-: I know, but if make a delay after everything is fine, maybe Isn't from there
[01:16:42] <Azrael_-> Omar-: i'm using the library "PLUpload" (an upload helper) which accepts dom-ids for the action to select files for upload. (js/flash/silverlight) the library binds to the click-event there during the setup. depending on the app-status i want to prevent this behaviour. (code would be too big and too much unnecessary things contained)
[01:17:34] <Azrael_-> "this behaviour": the binding shall be still there but i want to prevent the user to select even more files if the upload is in progress
[01:17:54] <Omar-> andrei1 I dont know if .append().done(function() {}); would work
[01:17:57] <Omar-> try it
[01:18:08] <andrei1> I've already tried it
[01:18:14] <andrei1> not working in this case
[01:18:43] <Omar-> Azrael_- try to disable button/link on click and enable it after successful upload
[01:19:21] <andrei1> I'll try DomSubTreeModified
[01:19:34] <everesttt> I need to learn how to apply formatting to selected text in a textarea. When I select a text in a textarea I want a popup with Bold|Italic options, and when I select Bold I want the selected text to be bold. ello.co uses this. What do I need to learn specifically to make this happen? Any links to tutorials? Thanks.
[01:20:18] <Azrael_-> Omar-: and this is where i fail, how do i disable the link?
[01:22:09] <Omar-> Azrael_- you can add a css property pointer-events: none;
[01:22:22] <Omar-> ?g css pointer-events
[01:22:22] <b-ot> Omar-: pointer-events - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[01:22:41] <Omar-> this will ignore click/touch events
[01:23:04] <Omar-> Azrael_- http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-events
[01:23:33] <Omar-> or (maybe) on click, check if upload is in process and return false
[01:24:26] <Azrael_-> GREAT, thank you very much, the css-class is perfect. unfortunately i can't modify the called function easily as it is within the  third party library
[01:25:22] <Omar-> Azrael_- but still you can modify it if you host it locally
[01:26:59] <Azrael_-> sure, but on every upgrade i'd have to remember it and thus the service would be quite arduous and i want to prevent that
[01:32:11] <neredsenvy> I know I can find all non-empty tr td's using find("tr td:not(:empty)") however what if my tr has two td and I need to select all tr's that have content in both td"s
[01:33:40] <neredsenvy> I have some rows like so <tr><td>title</td><td></td></tr> ... and some <tr><td>name</td><td>value</td><tr> I want to bind an event to all rows that have values in both columns
[01:35:04] <andrei1> Omar-: There is a problem with library executed after append
[01:35:57] <andrei1> so, the element is appended but when library return NULL try to get element by id
[01:36:11] <andrei1> when try to...
[01:36:42] <Omar-> neredsenvy use .filter()
[01:37:02] <Omar-> andrei1 can you create a fiddle with your code
[01:37:08] <Erwat> how should i do full screen that should work on mobile too?
[01:37:17] <Erwat> i read that there is no good solution for that yet, is that still the case?
[01:39:16] <Omar-> Erwat what do you mean?
[01:39:29] <youri> hi
[01:39:41] <andrei1> Omar-: I cannot reproduce those delays on fiddle , it's about library "googletag.display" method that try to getElementById after I append my element to DOM
[01:39:59] <youri> Which jquery effects are used on the images on the home page: http://www.comfortvilla.com/
[01:42:59] <Omar-> andrei1 assume this. var foo = $("<div/>", {id: "bar" });
[01:43:13] <Omar-> foo.appendTo("#parent");
[01:43:30] <Omar-> foo.addClass("anyClass");
[01:43:59] <andrei1> i Have something like this
[01:43:59] <Omar-> or foo.find(".element").addClass();
[01:43:59] <andrei1> var
[01:43:59] <andrei1>             slotName = generateSlotName(),
[01:43:59] <andrei1>             $slotEl= $('<div></div>')
[01:43:59] <andrei1>                 .attr('id', slotName);
[01:43:59] <andrei1>         
[01:43:59] <andrei1>         $target.replaceWith($slotEl);
[01:44:51] <Omar-> youri you do this with CSS transform: scale();
[01:45:25] <Omar-> img:hover { transform: sacle(1.2); }
[01:47:27] <Omar-> youri http://jsfiddle.net/suyaxgqp/
[01:47:50] <Omar-> andrei1 what's $target? and what does generateSlotName() do?
[01:48:31] <youri> Omar thxs you so much !
[01:48:57] <Omar-> you're welcome
[01:49:19] <youri> So how to implement this in drupal?
[01:50:18] <Omar-> youri I dont know
[01:50:21] <youri> Forget my question. Css is just there. Ciao ciao
[01:50:29] <Omar-> ciao
[01:50:45] <youri> Omar thxs again have a good day from egypt / sinay dessert / dahab
[01:51:15] <Omar-> youri you too.
[01:51:40] <Erwat> Omar-: i meant going to fullscreen from javascript
[01:51:45] <andrei1> Omar: $target is a jquery element and with generateSlotName get a unique id
[02:06:30] <Cork> neredsenvy: use a filter function
[02:07:36] <Cork> neredsenvy: $('tr').filter(function() { return $(this).find('td:empty') == 0; })
[02:08:00] <neredsenvy> thanks mate I figured it out from documentation
[02:10:18] <Omar-> andrei1 I dont know if you mean something like this http://jsfiddle.net/wwqm1tsr/
[02:10:51] <Omar-> Cork $(this).find('td:empty').length, right?
[02:11:07] <Cork> ... ya
[02:11:18] <Cork> silly me...
[02:11:21] * Omar- hands Cork a cup of hot coffee
[02:11:36] <Cork> been out running around all morning
[02:11:50] <Cork> so haven't really gotten into gears yet
[02:13:47] <Erwat> can i somehow prompt for a fullscreen in some set manner?
[02:13:59] <Cork> ?mdn requestFullscreen
[02:13:59] <b-ot> Cork: Element.requestFullscreen() - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.requestFullScreen
[02:14:14] <Erwat> Cork: yeah, but you need to put that somewhere where the user has to do an action to trigger it
[02:14:22] <Erwat> but sadly window.confirm doesn't work
[02:14:35] <Cork> Erwat: uh, requestFullscreen IS a request
[02:14:42] <Cork> the user can block it if they want
[02:14:52] <Erwat> yes but you can't call it from random places
[02:15:02] <Erwat> it has to be a direct result of a user action to be able to call it
[02:15:04] <Cork> ah, you mean like that
[02:15:06] <Erwat> otherwise you just get a warning
[02:15:12] <Erwat> and the way our buttons are implemented doesn't let me do that
[02:15:12] <Cork> ya it has to be from a trusted event
[02:15:29] <Cork> put a button somewhere for the user to click
[02:15:37] <Erwat> yeah but this is a game
[02:15:43] <Cork> still
[02:15:49] <Cork> it is the way to go
[02:15:49] <Erwat> i'd have to m ake a completely differen tbutton element fit in with other buttons
[02:16:27] <Erwat> but yeah you're obviously right
[02:16:32] <Erwat> was just wondering if there's an easy solution
[02:16:32] <baako> hi i have my nav set up like this http://kopy.io/mfrXD i want to slide the nav back in when you click any were in the #slidemenu but this seem to happen every if i click on anywhere with ul too. what is the best possible way to achieve this?
[02:19:41] <baako> http://jsfiddle.net/baako/rtzr8vju/
[02:22:18] <baako> it looks something like http://postimg.org/image/c1ml4vvef/ so when you click on the yellow area it should slide everything in
[02:23:08] <baako> the yellow area will be <div id="slidemenu" class="slide-active" style="left: 0px;"> and the white area will be ul
[02:24:52] <Cork> baako: http://jsfiddle.net/rtzr8vju/1/
[02:29:12] <baako> Cork: :(dont seem to do it. It seem you are hiding  the slidemenu by default and has a result of this when i click on the menu button to display the menu it doesnt get shown
[02:29:42] <Cork> baako: you would have to add the menu button to the closest filter
[02:29:48] <Duikb00t> As this is the jQuery question I have  a Q about inspecting elements.
[02:29:59] <Cork> all areas that shouldn't hide it needs to be a selector there
[02:29:59] <Duikb00t> How do you debug the best your js files using the Chrome inspector?
[02:30:21] <Cork> debug the best your js?
[02:30:30] <Cork> that sentence makes no sense
[02:30:34] <Duikb00t> ;D Sorry
[02:30:41] <Duikb00t> Example: You setup a hover with js.
[02:31:01] <Duikb00t> You see the link <a href ... >Cork</a> .
[02:31:17] <Duikb00t> When I click on that now in my chrome dev tools I see the js properties attached to that element.
[02:31:26] <Duikb00t> How can I easy detect where that element is called in my js file?
[02:31:31] <Duikb00t> Is that possible?
[02:31:45] <Cork> the element is called?
[02:31:58] <Cork> you mean when the event handler connected to that element or what?
[02:32:01] <Duikb00t> Call it whatever you want :) it's nothing I am currently using.
[02:32:01] <Duikb00t> Yes
[02:32:16] <Cork> put a breakpoint in the callback function
[02:32:40] <Duikb00t> Ok let's see if there is a site I can test it on :) Never did that before.
[02:33:30] <Duikb00t> Cork Are you talking about doing this? ;https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging/sources-view-region.jpg
[02:33:46] <Cork> ya
[02:34:36] <Duikb00t> Hmmm
[02:35:17] <andrei1> Omar-: Thank you for your time, I've reached my problem,  wasn't there.
[02:35:18] <Duikb00t> Ok I have a website open using a searchbox.
[02:35:28] <Duikb00t> I saw a function in their custom js file called 'setupSearch();
[02:35:35] <Duikb00t> I set a breakpoint on that line.
[02:35:42] <Duikb00t> Do I now just refresh that page?
[02:35:47] <Duikb00t> Or will it be gone then?
[02:36:28] <Cork> it will stick as long as the source isn't dynamic (loaded through eval)
[02:37:40] <neredsenvy> If I have event bound like so $('#pdf tr').click(function() { if(a) { show } else { hide }  }); is there a way to exclude that event for a button element inside #pdf tr td's ?
[02:38:11] <neredsenvy> Because when I click on my row it shows my textarea/button but then when I click inside my textarea it hides the row and with it the textarea/button
[02:38:13] <baako> Cork: i didnt understand what you mean
[02:38:21] <Cork> neredsenvy: you shouldn't use a selector like that in any case
[02:38:33] <Cork> neredsenvy: you don't want to bind hundreds of event handlers
[02:38:40] <Cork> use a delegated event handler on #pdf
[02:39:04] <neredsenvy> It's not hundreds I have 50 at most 50 tr's under #pdf div
[02:39:11] <baako> Cork: is this it? http://kopy.io/LO0ki
[02:39:13] <Cork> still 49 more then you need
[02:39:16] <andrei1> neredsenvy: put param e to your callback and call e.stopPropagation()
[02:39:54] <Cork> and do something like $('#pdf').on('click', 'tr', function(event) { if($(event.target).closest('.ignore-class').length == 0) {} })
[02:40:06] <Cork> andrei1: no, don't use stopPropagation
[02:40:33] <Cork> basically never kill event bubbling unless you have an extremely good reason to do so
[02:40:57] <Cork> it is bound to come back and bit you or someone else later in the projects life if you do
[02:40:58] <Duikb00t> e.preventDefault
[02:41:12] <Cork> preventDefault doesn't help in this case
[02:41:17] <Duikb00t> Oh ok.
[02:41:36] <Cork> as it isn't about the browser default action
[02:42:00] <Duikb00t> What a weird paste btw :P
[02:42:46] <Cork> baako: of all the elements you want to allow clicking on is inside #navbar-toggle, sure
[02:42:58] <neredsenvy> I have a div with some 10-20 <tr><td></td><td></td></tr> When user clicks on tr I add another <td> with a  textarea element in it however I also have it set that if user clicks on the tr again it removes the textarea the problem is it does this also if user clicks into the text area meaning they cannot enter any text in it.
[02:43:20] <Cork> ah
[02:43:37] <Cork> neredsenvy: $('#pdf').on('click', 'tr', function(event) { if($(event.target).closest('textarea').length == 0) {} })
[02:43:45] <Cork> should do what you want
[02:45:34] <neredsenvy> U thanks that worked like a charm
[02:46:23] <baako> Cork: but the element i want to be allow click is the parent div http://kopy.io/mfrXD ul content the menu while the div is the parent. When the menu extents out it looks like http://postimg.org/image/c1ml4vvef/ the parent is the yellow and the child ic the white
[02:47:20] <Cork> baako: so use the same code but on #slidemenu if you only want it to allow it
[02:47:49] <Cork> baako: alternatively you can do something like  $('#slidemenu').on('click', function(event) { if(this === event.target) {} }
[02:57:51] <baako> Cork: http://kopy.io/vZU14
[03:00:42] <baako> but it doesn't remove it
[03:01:10] <Cork> this == event.target means you can only click directly on the element
[03:01:10] <DRSK> <div class="product-dropdown"> I'd like to bind that div to self click as well as children li's :: $( '.product-dropdown' ).on('click', 'li, self', function() {}); what can I do instead of *self* ?
[03:01:15] <Cork> bubbling events won't work
[03:01:32] <DRSK> lol that looked like an answer to me as well ;p
[03:01:56] <Cork> DRSK: just bind a straight click handler
[03:01:59] <Cork> don't use the delegate
[03:02:06] <Cork> and you should get about what you're asking for
[03:02:31] <DRSK> Do you mean I should do one for clicking the div and another for clicking its children li's ?
[03:03:06] <DRSK> $( '.product-dropdown' ).on('click', function() {}); then another such as $( '.product-dropdown ul li' ).on('click' ?
[03:03:28] <DRSK> Trying to grasp what you mean by "straight" click handler :)
[03:06:38] <baako> Cork: The event in that kopy is the slidemenu which is the parent div
[03:06:55] <saedelaere> jquery UI Datepicker ( "getDate" ) returns different Datetime Strings on Linux/MacOS and Windows. https://bpaste.net/show/08ab6321747a
[03:07:18] <saedelaere> As you can see on Windows the Name of the Timezone in Brackets is missing
[03:07:27] <saedelaere> is there any reason for this?
[03:07:53] <Cork> DRSK: i mean just bind a straight event handler on the .product-dropdown and handle it all from there
[03:08:10] <Cork> baako: could you reproduce the situation in a working fiddle?
[03:08:22] <saedelaere> I am parsing the string inmy django backend and have the formatting of the incoming Datetime string hardcoded
[03:08:48] <baako> Cork: i did a console log and it seem like i clicking the parent will take it from here :D thanks again
[03:08:55] <mooncup> djangoooooooo
[03:09:15] <mooncup> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAooXLAPoBQ
[03:09:35] <saedelaere> mooncup: :)
[03:35:52] <baako> if you have a varible like var toggler = '.navbar-toggle'; can do something like $(toggler).removeClass('hide');
[03:43:41] <DRSK> Cork » By "just bind a straight event handler on the .class and handle it from there" do you mean using $( '.class' ).bind('click', function( e ) { if( e.target === this etc stuff ) }?
[03:45:13] <DRSK> Sorry I haven't got the terminology down yet, the handler would be the thing it *does* on the event I'm guessing, and this handler could be a function checking what I clicked in the scope of the element I bound?
[03:45:42] <Cork> DRSK: no
[03:46:21] <Cork> DRSK: hmm does product-dropdow contain more then just the ul?
[03:46:37] <Cork> actually could you provide the dom structure in a fiddle?
[03:46:38] <DRSK> It contains a span as well yeah
[03:46:41] <DRSK> Sure, 2 sec
[03:46:52] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/ugfo734a/ @ cor
[03:47:14] <Cork> and what is it you want to accomplish?
[03:47:43] <DRSK> Cork » basically that thing it does by toggling a class, but I'd also want to do some additional stuff if I click an LI's <a> inside
[03:48:15] <Cork> DRSK: cleanest might be to separate those into two event handlers
[03:48:23] <massimilianos76> hello!
[03:48:29] <Cork> or you could recreate it by checking $(event.target)
[03:48:37] <Cork> but i would prob do two event handlers
[03:48:40] <DRSK> All right, thanks. I was just wondering what approach would be better, using event.stuff or binding twice etc.
[03:48:53] <DRSK> Okay but just for reference, when you said bind it to one straight event handler and use that, what did you mean?
[03:49:07] <Cork> DRSK: what you're doing right now
[03:49:19] <Cork> clicks on a will trigger the same event handler
[03:49:29] <Cork> so if it is meant to do the same thing you could handle it all from here
[03:49:37] <DRSK> Ah
[03:50:31] <massimilianos76> I have a problem
[03:50:39] <massimilianos76> how can I send you my snippet?
[03:50:49] <Cork> ?paste
[03:50:50] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:50:59] <DRSK> Is there any downside to chain it? Such as $( '.dropdown' ).on('click' stuff to addClass ).children('ul').children('li').on('click', function() )?
[03:51:19] <DRSK> I'm probably not going to, but just curious
[03:53:33] <massimilianos76> ok this
[03:53:41] <massimilianos76> this is my snippet
[03:53:43] <massimilianos76> https://jsfiddle.net/89jwpn98/1/
[03:53:50] <massimilianos76> how can I do this?
[03:54:23] <baako> i am trying to remove a css proptery<div id="slidemenu" class="slide-active" style="left: 0px; display: none;"> i am trying to remove that display:none; So i tried this http://kopy.io/6XR5l but this doesnt seem to overwrite that display:none
[03:56:39] <Cork> baako: css('display': '')
[03:56:45] <Cork> opps
[03:56:49] <Cork> baako: css({ 'display': '' })
[03:59:40] <baako> cheers Cork my first try didnt work because i spell display wrong :S
[04:00:09] <Cork> baako: though you could just use .hide/.show instead
[04:00:51] <Xatenev> baako: lol
[04:02:47] <baako> Cork: if i use .show it will just make thinng too long because i have to to remove .show which i think will slow down the mobile app
[04:05:05] <massimilianos76> help me please :'(
[04:06:37] <Cork> baako: uh remove show?
[04:06:50] <alaing> I'm building a jquery widget, looking through the API docs it says that every widget has properties. How do i access those properties inside the widget. the one i'm after is wdgetName
[04:06:58] <Cork> baako: $(this).css('display', 'block') => $(this).show()
[04:07:13] <Cork> baako: opps other way around
[04:07:23] <Cork> baako: $(this).css('display', 'none') => $(this).hide()
[04:07:28] <Cork> baako: $(this).css('display', '') => $(this).show()
[04:07:36] <Cork> this is exactly what show/hide does
[04:07:50] <Cork> so why reinvent the wheel
[04:07:57] <alaing> alternately (and better) use a class and just use addClass
[04:08:01] <alaing> or removeClass
[04:08:11] <Cork> or toggleClass :)
[04:08:19] <alaing> or that :-D
[04:08:27] <Cork> but ya, all of the above works
[04:08:41] <delboy1978uk> anyone fancy trying my new bezier curve plugin? :-D https://github.com/delboy1978uk/jqbezier
[04:08:44] <Cork> my point is that .css adds code complexity for no reason
[04:08:53] <alaing> i remember see a ptweet from mr irish myself saying .show/hide is bad
[04:08:56] <Cork> as there is shorter commands that is easier to read, that does the same thing
[04:09:01] <delboy1978uk> now with sine wave colour cycling! :P
[04:09:04] <alaing> in terms of bottlenecks
[04:09:21] <Cork> alaing: i personally think style="" should be avoided as much as possible
[04:09:29] <alaing> I agree
[04:09:34] <Cork> and i think i have like 5-6 instances of it in the entire page
[04:09:44] <Cork> (<div style="float:left">)
[04:09:51] <alaing> I'm building a jquery widget, looking through the API docs it says that every widget has properties. How do i access those properties inside the widget. the one i'm after is widgetName
[04:10:04] <baako> yes Cork because I am using  $(this).toggle("slide"); this add the display:none when it slide back it
[04:10:04] <alaing> jquery ui widget
[04:10:06] <baako> in*
[04:10:24] <baako> thats why i did what i did
[04:10:25] <Cork> baako: and you want to just slide the element not hide it?
[04:10:46] <delboy1978uk> alaing: check my link above, you can see how i took options into my jquery plugin and accesses them from in the script
[04:10:47] <Cork> .animate({ height: 'toggle }, 1000) in that case
[04:11:12] <delboy1978uk> oh right sorry thought you were making a jquery plugin
[04:11:27] <delboy1978uk> and not using a ui-widget
[04:11:37] <baako> Cork: click on the menu it slides out i slide on the parent div(which we talk about before) that toggle function slide it back in
[04:11:46] <Cork> ah
[04:11:53] <alaing> delboy1978uk: but thats not using jquery ui widget factory
[04:11:56] <Cork> ah, so jquery ui effects
[04:12:02] <Cork> (i don't use them normally)
[04:12:06] <delboy1978uk> sorry misread alaing
[04:12:14] <alaing> no problem
[04:14:01] <alaing> i'm referring to this http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#jQuery-widget1
[04:14:17] <alaing> under the properties heading
[04:16:59] <alaing> oh of course the answer
[04:17:05] <alaing> this.widgetName
[04:18:03] <baako> Cork: same thing  $(this).animate({height: 'toggle'}, 1000); Still add display:none Same as (this).toggle("slide");
[04:18:19] <Cork> uh, you ure?
[04:18:24] <Cork> it shouldn't
[04:19:16] <baako> yes it is. I tested it with and without. With it it had display none without it doesnt add anything ofcourse this also means the div doesnt slide
[04:19:53] <baako> and the result of this is that it does add display none to the parent div
[04:21:24] <mezod> is there any way to exclude a 'li' element from a $('ul').sortable() ?
[04:22:00] <Cork> add a class to it and exclude it in the elements selector
[04:23:01] <mezod> Cork: that will let other elements to be dragged under this one tho, right?
[04:23:23] <Cork> ugg... good question i don't remember
[04:24:27] <mezod> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13885665/sortable-and-draggable-how-to-exclude-an-element-from-sortable-list-being-dragg
[04:24:36] <mezod> second part of first question might fix that
[04:30:21] <compact> hi, I'm trying to use autocomplete. this is my son encoded value: {"query":"Unit","suggestions":[{"value":"Regional & Metro (TAR012)","data":"TAR012","id":"TAR012"},{"value":"Air Freight (DELV002)","data":"DELV002","id":"DELV002"},{"value":"Interstate (DELVR-555)","data":"DELVR-555","id":"DELVR-555"}]}
[04:30:33] <compact> however, when i type in the autocomplete, no results show
[04:30:34] <compact> any idea
[04:31:02] <Cork> compact: the format isn't what autocomplete expects
[04:31:11] <Cork> so you would have to modify it for autocomplete to understand it
[04:33:32] <krambiorix> hi, can someone give me a hand to make the guillotine plugin work with a modal dialog? http://jsfiddle.net/ykso86cy/3/
[04:35:21] <Omar-> hi
[04:36:20] <compact> Cork, I've changed result to [{"id":1,"value":"bo","label":"label"},{"id":1,"value":"bo","label":"label"},{"id":1,"value":"bo","label":"label"}]
[04:36:31] <compact> still no dice
[04:37:02] <Cork> compact: and the server returns application/json?
[04:37:07] <Cork> and note text/html
[04:37:33] <Cork> cause that should work
[04:39:04] <krambiorix> did anyone work with the guillotine plugin?
[04:46:33] <compact> cork, yeah html/php
[04:46:51] <Cork> compact: you need to sent the correct content-type header
[04:47:03] <Cork> or the client won't know what to do with the byte stream
[04:47:41] <NikoZz> hi there
[04:48:01] <NikoZz> any good tutorials on how to build javascript "frameworks" or js event handling?
[05:04:44] <massimilianos76> anyone can help me please?
[05:04:53] <massimilianos76> https://jsfiddle.net/89jwpn98/1/
[05:07:21] <krambiorix> what is the difference between a modal and a dialog?
[05:08:35] <Woet> modal is usually to show info, dialog is to prompt the user for a response
[05:08:40] <Woet> but to be honest they're pretty ambigious
[05:08:46] <Woet> ambiguous *
[05:08:58] <krambiorix> Woet, i thought modal is bootstrap, dialog is jquery ui?
[05:09:16] <Woet> how do you mean? they are not unique to either project
[05:09:24] <Woet> they might be the specific words they chose for it
[05:12:33] <krambiorix> ow ok
[05:29:26] <DRSK> I am to build a hash thing for isotope, and I think I've got it down to something I can work with. However I'm confused how to format my links in <a href="#!/filterhere"> or #!filterhere or do I use ! at all? do I use a / ? I'm new to this :p
[05:29:54] <Woet> and the relevance to jquery is..?
[05:30:16] <DRSK> Right now I'm trying to split the hash in jQuery using deparam or if it was param
[06:05:07] <Cork> DRSK: the ! is to make sure it doesn't match an id in the page by incident
[06:05:28] <Cork> DRSK: if you add a leading / or not depends on what you want to do
[06:49:08] <DRSK> Cork » thank you for your explanation, so to put it in other words basically the exclamation mark is to differentiate it from traditional #anchors and the forward slash is often used to separate values if you have more than one perhaps?
[06:49:31] <DRSK> regardless I'll preventDefault but just so I get the picture using hashes
[06:49:38] <Cork> DRSK: the rest is normally to build a path
[06:49:56] <Cork> you could use comma or any other character
[06:50:01] <Cork> it really depends on what you need
[06:50:26] <DRSK> ah. More recently though I've seen "hashes" immitating GET, is there a specific reason to evade using #! ?
[06:50:32] <Cork> but the hashbang idea was for a way to make ajax change the url
[06:50:43] <DRSK> As in ?something=somethingElse rather than #!something=somethingElse etc
[06:50:59] <Cork> http://www.example.com/#!/path/that/would/normally/be/used
[06:51:15] <DRSK> Ohh right that makes sense
[06:51:30] <Cork> and what you want to put after #! is completely optional
[06:51:39] <Cork> it really depends on what you want to "hide"
[06:52:01] <Cork> DRSK: also not that today we have history.pushState/history.replaceState
[06:52:12] <Cork> so #! isn't really needed anymore
[06:52:16] <DRSK> Are those the HTML5 back thingies?
[06:52:46] <Cork> going to be mean, no
[06:52:54] <Cork> html5 is marketing and it doesn't back anything
[06:53:05] <DRSK> meaning setting one after another allows you to revert using the back in the browser? I meant
[06:53:07] <Cork> but yes there is dom specifications for history.pustState
[06:53:24] <Cork> ?mdn pushState
[06:53:24] <b-ot> Cork: Manipulating the browser history - Web developer guide - Mozilla ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[06:53:38] <Cork> DRSK: yes

[07:02:47] <jm116_> do alerts work in jsfiddle?
[07:02:53] <jm116_> alert("hello world"); ?
[07:02:57] <Cork> yes
[07:03:14] <jm116_> I am bad , forgive me
[07:07:52] <jm116_> firstly a simple one i'm failing with https://jsfiddle.net/MajorTennis/zzLoanqs/13/ line 221 of the JS
[07:08:33] <jm116_> 390 in the html , I can't seem to make the alert pop up
[07:09:43] <jm116_> how do i know when to start with a '.' a '#' or nthing at all/
[07:11:46] <prohobo> jm116_: . denotes a class
[07:11:50] <prohobo> # an id
[07:12:00] <jm116_> thanks
[07:12:39] <prohobo> what the hell happened
[07:12:50] <prohobo> why is there so much script/css/html
[07:13:02] <jm116_> I know i know check out the external resources if you want a giggle
[07:13:27] <jm116_> The effort i've put into trying to make a test case that won't get thwarted could of been used to solve my initial issue
[07:13:28] <prohobo> O_O
[07:13:50] <jm116_> I took as much out as i could without breaking it
[07:14:16] <jm116_> im not a designer and im not a web dev either but i claimed to no some javascript and now im the office jquery/ajax wizzard
[07:14:35] <prohobo> lol
[07:14:53] <prohobo> anyways
[07:14:59] <prohobo> there's no alert in that script
[07:15:17] <jm116_> 223 of the js?
[07:15:33] <BillCriswell> jm116_: Sucker.
[07:15:51] <jm116_> BillCriswell, whats up bill?
[07:16:11] <jm116_> enjoying my misery aha
[07:16:12] <BillCriswell> jm116_: "i claimed to no some javascript and now im the office jquery/ajax wizzard"
[07:16:17] <BillCriswell> Oh ok good.
[07:16:25] <prohobo> jm116_: doesn't look like $(document).ready() is being run
[07:16:53] <jm116_> 201 i think
[07:17:24] <prohobo> no i mean it's not getting called
[07:17:58] <jm116_> hmm , what can i do to fix that ?
[07:18:14] <prohobo> there's some kind of error: SyntaxError: missing name after . operator
[07:18:24] <prohobo> in line 2891 of _display
[07:18:27] <prohobo> *thumbs up*
[07:18:53] <prohobo> essentially
[07:18:54] <jm116_> 2891 ?
[07:19:01] <prohobo> your code is full of syntax errors
[07:19:20] <jm116_> like those youtube comments that quote after the videos ended 16:02 for lulz
[07:19:27] <Cork> jm116_: alert.("hello world");
[07:19:30] <Cork> remove the dot :)
[07:20:01] <prohobo> ajaxForm is not a function
[07:20:04] <prohobo> what's missing?
[07:20:16] <jm116_> ah I guess this is from me trying to strip it down
[07:20:23] <jm116_> I can refill it
[07:20:59] <Cork> jm116_: its alert("hello world"); not alert.("hello world");
[07:21:17] <jm116_> cool it was one of my futile attempts to make it work
[07:21:32] <jm116_> i'll take that on baord
[07:22:58] <Cork> the ajaxForm is a plugin
[07:23:03] <Cork> so you need to load that
[07:23:45] <prohobo> https://jsfiddle.net/MajorTennis/zzLoanqs/13/
[07:23:47] <prohobo> did this update?
[07:23:49] <prohobo> i dunno
[07:23:54] <Cork> though jquery.form.js should include that one
[07:23:56] <prohobo> i got the menu working
[07:24:18] <jm116_> i think im on 16 now everytime i run it incremements
[07:24:49] <jm116_> some of my other click events work
[07:32:29] <notchris> This works on load, how do I make it work on resize? http://jsfiddle.net/ozgup7fk/
[07:34:27] <Cork> motowncloud: you should look at using @media instead
[07:34:50] <motowncloud> ?
[07:34:56] <DRSK> I think you meant to say that to notchris ;p
[07:35:12] <Cork> motowncloud: sorry wrong nick
[07:35:15] <motowncloud> :)
[07:35:18] <notchris> Cork: You mean pure css?
[07:35:23] <Cork> yes
[07:35:36] <notchris> Cork: It cant be set as background-image
[07:35:37] <Cork> the browser needs to know about this before it draws
[07:35:45] <notchris> So how to change src?
[07:35:47] <Cork> or things will look wrong
[07:36:01] <notchris> You cannot change src with pure CSS
[07:36:09] <Cork> notchris: if you have to use an image your kinda out of luck
[07:36:29] <Cork> cause ya, setting it as a background on an element is the solution
[07:36:43] <DRSK> If you must use js there's matchMedia() but changing src's based on resizes? Not too sure about that ;p
[07:36:46] <notchris> Cork: Thank you for confirming
[07:37:01] <Cork> DRSK: the match doesn't really help
[07:37:04] <notchris> I have an SVG of the image actually
[07:37:13] <notchris> I could use the SVG code and drop that in dynamically
[07:37:16] <Cork> the problem is relying on the resize event
[07:37:26] <Cork> notchris: its an option
[07:37:43] <notchris> I find it hard to believe that jquery cannot accuratley change the src on resize
[07:37:47] <Cork> if the svg scales you could just change the width of the element
[07:37:50] <Cork> *image
[07:37:54] <Cork> and it should behave
[07:38:05] <Cork> notchris: its not that it can't change it
[07:38:10] <Cork> its that it will look bad
[07:38:20] <notchris> Why will it look bad though?
[07:38:29] <notchris> Size? Render?
[07:38:40] <Cork> big image > change size > new size with the wrong dimention > js gets notified of the change > jquery replaces the image > looks right
[07:38:47] <notchris> The size is not changing
[07:38:56] <notchris> It’s simply switching out a white-out version
[07:39:04] <notchris> Of our logo
[07:39:07] <Cork> the window changes size
[07:39:19] <Cork> the browser sends these events lazy
[07:39:21] <notchris> But the image dimensions do not change, and the image is responsive
[07:39:34] <notchris> Am I misunderstanding?
[07:39:37] <Cork> so you don't have a chance to react to it before it is drawn wrongly
[07:39:47] <Cork> the window dimention not the image
[07:39:55] <notchris> I see
[07:40:13] <Cork> that is why you want to use css
[07:40:15] <notchris> Well, it looks like the logical thing to do is to find a way to use background-image instead of serving an image
[07:40:21] <Cork> cause then you tell the browser what to do when it happened
[07:40:29] <Cork> instead of reacting to what happened
[07:40:38] <notchris> Very good, thank you Cork++
[07:40:40] <Cork> notchris: its easy to do
[07:40:44] <prohobo> im fucking sick of ubuntu
[07:40:47] <prohobo> sorry wrong channel
[07:40:47] <notchris> ^
[07:41:11] <Cork> you could do something simple as <a id="logio" href="/"></a>
[07:41:27] <Cork> and then just add the dimensions for the element and the background image
[07:42:10] <Cork> notchris: there is another option you could have two img tags
[07:42:20] <DRSK> bah I was just about to say that ;p
[07:42:25] <Cork> and just display/hide them based on the @media query
[07:42:59] <Cork> and it is actually better as that will trigger the browser to download the image before hand
[07:43:06] <Cork> so you won't get flicker
[07:48:09] <notchris> Cork: http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/
[07:48:12] <notchris> This worked well
[07:48:17] <notchris> Used background-image
[08:03:32] <frabblerock> is anyone here familiar with handlebars

[08:15:51] <iphone6alt> hi there
[08:19:42] <iphone6alt> I am using $( document ).width() to initilise a slide show/carousel all was good and i thought we were cooking with gas ... but then out of no where my HTC ONE M8 started to do something very odd ... so I made the page alert me of the value on $(document).width() and my phone reports 33177 and i checked it on the chrome emulator in iphone6 mode it reports 375px as it should and on the REAL
[08:19:42] <iphone6alt> iphone it reports 980 and still displays properly even in landscape mode!?? any one have a clue what on earth is going on here ? this happen totally out of no where i guess I should consider rebooting the HTC but why on earth is the iphone and chrome emulator giving different results any way??
[08:56:49] <jmfurlott> I was just thrown onto a new project that is a bit messy, and am trying to diagnose some click listeners.  Essentially, I can't get a click listener to register a particular elements (buttons), and think it is due to other click listeners that are leaking or "taking priority".  Has anybody here dealt with  something like this? What is the best way to debug this kind of thing?
[08:59:08] <robertmaxrees> are the buttons added after the listeners?
[08:59:38] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you might have some listeners running e.preventDefault();, preventing other stuff from running correctly.
[09:00:02] <jmfurlott> robertmaxrees: the buttons should be being added before the click listeners are attached
[09:00:14] <jmfurlott> robertmaxrees: the preventDefault() sounds definitely possible
[09:00:26] <robertmaxrees> "should be" tells me that there's a distinct chance they're not :)
[09:00:29] <robertmaxrees> check the preventDefault() calls.
[09:01:12] <ThePendulum> Is it possible to select an element from a variable
[09:01:24] <ThePendulum> So rather than $('#id'), ID is a variable
[09:01:26] <robertmaxrees> ThePendulum yep - the jquery selector is just a string.
[09:01:37] <ccmonster> what might cause an Iframe with js source to be redirected to by IE?
[09:01:39] <robertmaxrees> so as long as the variable is a string, you can do whatever.
[09:01:40] <ccmonster> but no other browser.
[09:01:41] <jmfurlott> robertmaxrees: is there a way to check the preventDefault's from the inspector?
[09:01:48] <ThePendulum> robertmaxrees: hmm, not sure why this isn't working then :(
[09:02:00] <ThePendulum> robertmaxrees: can I simply do $('#' + var) as well?
[09:02:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:02:08] <ThePendulum> peculiar
[09:02:21] <robertmaxrees> jmfurlott you can look at all the listeners bound to a particular element in most browsers' dev tools.
[09:04:02] <jmfurlott> robertmaxrees: okay thank you
[09:07:10] <robertmaxrees> ThePendulum http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/61qm0gje/ for an example.
[09:07:48] <ThePendulum> I'm doing the craziest shit with JS and jQuery yet this is giving me a hard time, lol
[09:08:10] <robertmaxrees> console log out the var and make sure it's spelled right, make sure you're not trying to do something like ##someID
[09:08:14] <robertmaxrees> make sure the element actually exists.
[09:08:14] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[09:09:01] <ThePendulum> hmmm
[09:09:06] <ThePendulum> I think I might have a capital problem
[09:09:07] <ThePendulum> good call
[09:09:23] <ThePendulum> yep there we go
[09:09:31] <ThePendulum> the IDs were a b c while the call was A B C
[09:09:36] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[09:09:39] <ThePendulum> there I go
[09:09:45] <ThePendulum> it's always something ridiculous like this isn't it
[09:09:48] <ThePendulum> I feel retarded
[09:16:26] <robertmaxrees> ThePendulum fyi not an OK thing to say fwiw
[09:49:53] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* dammit twitter.
[09:53:16] <krambiorix> did anyone here use Guillotine in combo with PHP?
[10:11:35] <bbclover> if I do var a = $.ajax(// whatever parameters); I'll have in a whatever is returned? a json object right?
[10:11:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:11:52] <robertmaxrees> you'll have the promise object that $.ajax() returns
[10:11:58] <robertmaxrees> because ajax is async.
[10:12:10] <bbclover> oh yeah so I'm gonna make it synchronous here
[10:12:17] <bbclover> O.O
[10:12:29] <robertmaxrees> even making it sync won't change that.
[10:12:33] <robertmaxrees> use promises instead.
[10:12:39] <bbclover> can you show me some references?
[10:12:52] <robertmaxrees> sure - i JUST got done messing with them :)
[10:13:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hmxa8ryy/6/
[10:13:29] <bbclover> I thought making it sync would hang the browser until the call was complete
[10:13:36] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:13:42] <robertmaxrees> making it sync is exactly what you don't want to do.
[10:14:43] <bbclover> but I want that json
[10:14:46] <bbclover> and I want it now
[10:15:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hmxa8ryy/8/ for your case.
[10:22:38] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: not sure if you recall my situation from yesterday, but it turns out it is a webkit bug still in existence today with safari yet it has been fixed in chrome and other browsers
[10:22:50] <robertmaxrees> don't recall.
[10:22:56] <robertmaxrees> also: chrome doesn't use webkit any more :)
[10:23:05] <Grumpicat> ello all
[10:23:26] <Grumpicat> Was wondering if someone could help me out a second - with regard to websites, jquery and forums.
[10:23:33] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Grumpicat
[10:23:33] <b-ot> Grumpicat: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:23:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:23:51] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: indeed, but isn't it a fork from webkit at some point? The issue was in regards to a mousedown/mouseup on the same element with no click event
[10:24:21] <robertmaxrees> i vaguely recall that.  and yeah, it was forked at one point long ago.  slowly becoming more and more different though.
[10:24:39] <kevireilly> absolutely. It is called blink now iirc
[10:24:39] <Grumpicat> Ok! Straight to the point. I'm looking at building a site, where I click a 'button' but instead of the forum loading on a new page, it just loads directly on the page.
[10:24:42] <Grumpicat> what's that called
[10:24:49] <robertmaxrees> ajax
[10:24:52] <Grumpicat> ty.
[10:25:39] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: the issue is kind of crazy. Even text within an element is considered a different node
[10:25:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:25:49] <robertmaxrees> that's the same in all browsers.
[10:25:57] <robertmaxrees> called a "textnode"
[10:26:03] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: I'm so lost
[10:26:18] <kevireilly> right, but when it comes to mouse events they at least bubble up properly
[10:26:36] <robertmaxrees> bbclover :) basically, anything that needs to happen after the ajax is done needs to be in a callback of the ajax call.
[10:26:40] <robertmaxrees> promises make that stupid simple.
[10:31:44] <robertmaxrees> bbclover show me what you're trying to do.
[10:31:49] <robertmaxrees> i might be able to help a little better
[10:39:45] <Grumpicat> Robert, any ideas on an article or two that can show me Ajax in action. Forum loading on the same page?
[10:41:08] <kevireilly> Grumpicat: is the forum custom? if not, they might already have a plugin or something available
[10:41:56] <kevireilly> ah nevermind me, just re-read the original question -- I was thinking loading new forum posts, comments, more topics, etc
[10:42:39] <Grumpicat> All the content was in a <main body> and when you click a <button> the <main body> switched out to the forum, info page, etc etc.
[10:42:53] <Grumpicat> No loading - just instant.
[10:43:27] <Grumpicat> Last time I saw that, was a Phpbb3 forum - but custom could work.
[10:43:58] <kevireilly> Grumpicat: well, to make it instant with no loading you have to load it at some point. So it is presumably already on the page and hidden or automatically loaded after initial load
[10:44:14] <rajlaksh> anyone using ajaxify
[10:44:30] <Grumpicat> Yea, kevireilly - it is exactly like that.
[10:45:57] <kevireilly> Grumpicat: so, a not great approach is building the non-forum aspects onto your forum templates or what have you, hiding the forum elements by default and displaying what you actually want seen
[10:46:39] <rajlaksh> any good plugin for without reload load content?
[10:46:59] <rajlaksh> website reload
[10:47:48] <kevireilly> rajlaksh: web sockets, ajax polling, etc. I think some frameworks like angular does this out of the box also, but I can't recall which ones have two way data binding
[10:48:34] <rajlaksh> ajaxify works on their site but docs is not good :(
[10:48:43] <kevireilly> ok
[10:48:44] <Grumpicat> Kevie, and call the elements I want shown when they activate the forum or so on?
[10:49:36] <kevireilly> Grumpicat: yeah, but it isn't great because this means A) you're building on top of a forum system which might not be fun B) you're loading your forum even when it isn't needed which could make page loads slow and I'm sure there is a C) or more
[10:50:22] <nemothekid> In an AJAX request, if the jquery (1) fails to parse the JSON response or (2) the response wasn't JSON, is there a documented value for responseJSON?
[10:50:39] <nemothekid> like is it null? or undefined?
[10:51:30] <robertmaxrees> nemothekid it won't do anything, because it failed.
[10:51:37] <robertmaxrees> and the success/done callbacks aren't invoked.
[10:52:04] <nemothekid> the error ones are
[10:52:20] <nemothekid> and xhr.responseJSON is a field on xhr
[10:52:48] <robertmaxrees> ah that's what you're referring to.  i'd have to dump into the jquery source since i don't remember offhand.
[10:53:00] <nemothekid> ok don't worry about
[10:53:02] <nemothekid> uit
[11:23:36] <guzzlefry> I'm fairly certain this is accurate, but can anyone confirm that the .done() method on $.ajax() only fires on an HTTP response of 200?
[11:23:58] <robertmaxrees> it fires as long as the request was successful.
[11:24:23] <robertmaxrees> if the browser has a cached response, that'll meet the success criteria.
[11:24:23] <tnu0> Hi there. I'm a beginner in all js stuff, and I don't understand why some actions are not performed (without error). So I'd like to check if I target the right dom elements. Doing a console.log($myElement) is not very readable. Is there another way to know the dom element selected by a jQuery var?
[11:24:32] <guzzlefry> I see, thank you.
[11:24:49] <robertmaxrees> tnu0 that's basically how you do it.
[11:25:06] <robertmaxrees> you could add some css to it I guess, but the console is really going to become your best friend.
[11:25:23] <tnu0> robertmaxrees, Mmmm… It just gives me the context (which I already know) and the selector I put (which I already know too).
[11:25:43] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to see?
[11:25:50] <tnu0> I still want to use the console, I just want to know if the console.log($myElement) is all I can do ^^
[11:26:00] <robertmaxrees> you can mouse over them and often get them highlighted in the browser.
[11:26:06] <tnu0> robertmaxrees, I'd like to see the concrete dom tree for example
[11:26:10] <robertmaxrees> there are other console methods.
[11:27:29] <tnu0> robertmaxrees, Which one would you use to check if you're targeting the right div for example?
[11:27:55] <robertmaxrees> console.log() and then mouse over the conole entry to see it highlighted in the browser window.
[11:28:09] <tnu0> Mmmm does not seem to work for me (chromium).
[11:28:15] <samssh> Firefox
[11:28:28] <robertmaxrees> let me see.
[11:29:41] <robertmaxrees> works for me just fine.
[11:29:52] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/siMxS71.png
[11:30:51] <samssh> tnu0, Is the browser up to date?
[11:31:01] <samssh> What OS are you running?
[11:31:56] <tnu0> Yep, up to date. Xubuntu.
[11:32:14] <robertmaxrees> check the .length of the selector to make sure you actually have something selected.
[11:34:00] <tnu0> Oh did not see all properties like childrennodes and so on
[11:34:05] <tnu0> Will help me :)
[11:34:19] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i rarely find myself needing to worry about those things in my day-to-day.
[11:34:35] <lrdc> hi! i have a question, does "$( 'html' ).click( function() {...}" increase client memory usage? because i think it does everytime user click in the page..
[11:35:06] <robertmaxrees> lrdc the binding itself does a minimal amount./  what's the code inside of that function doing?
[11:35:10] <robertmaxrees> that might be the bigger problem.
[11:35:15] <tnu0> robbyoconnor, Usually my changes work or put an error. It's an exceptional case ;)
[11:35:25] <lrdc> robertmaxrees: i'm trying to hide the popup when user click outside the box
[11:35:32] <robertmaxrees> tnu0 wrong autocomplete, and what's the error?
[11:35:40] <tnu0> Woops sorry
[11:35:47] <lrdc> i just curious is it significant to memory usage
[11:35:53] <tnu0> Well no error robertmaxrees
[11:35:57] <tnu0> That's the problem
[11:36:00] <robertmaxrees> no, event bindings are not, lrdc
[11:36:07] <robertmaxrees> tnu0 ah, good times then.
[11:36:11] <tnu0> ;)
[11:36:14] <robertmaxrees> if you need help, we're here.
[11:36:27] <lrdc> ok then, thanks for the answer robertmaxrees
[11:36:40] <robertmaxrees> try profiling your code.
[11:37:20] <caseyd> So I would like to show one image then after a random amount of time, with a max of like 5 seconds, it would change to another. Does jquery have a way to do that?
[11:37:35] <caseyd> I'm making a fake server status page, and I thought that might be a way to make it look like its actually checking
[11:37:37] <tnu0> The "context" in my console will be my scope, right?
[11:37:54] <robertmaxrees> caseyd raw js and jquery, sure.
[11:38:20] <robertmaxrees> tnu0 sorta.
[11:38:39] <robertmaxrees> not the way you're probably thinking.
[11:38:43] <tnu0> Mmm.
[11:39:22] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/context/
[11:40:07] <tnu0> Thanks
[11:40:20] <robertmaxrees> what's the bug you're working on?
[11:49:33] <kantt> Hi everyone :)
[11:50:07] <kantt> I have a little question. Do someone knows a good-themed form step plugin?
[11:58:24] <SmashingX> Is it possible to have a menu on the left of a page with filters and a table on the right side of the page that receives those filters?
[11:58:39] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX sounds like isotope.
[11:59:02] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: ?
[11:59:21] <robertmaxrees> it's a plugin
[11:59:45] <robertmaxrees> assuming i understand your question correctly.
[12:03:28] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: I think you are right
[12:03:41] <SmashingX> I found a plugin that uses jquery
[12:03:56] <SmashingX> but I would like to know if that can be used for jequery mobile
[12:04:23] <robertmaxrees> sure
[12:05:02] <SmashingX> so what would be the difference between them then?
[12:05:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:05:12] <SmashingX> besides that jquery can be used for mobile devices of course
[12:05:19] <SmashingX> jqeury mobile
[12:05:30] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand your question.
[12:06:00] <SmashingX> Ok basically I would lik eto know what are the things that if I develop a website with jquery won’t work for jquery mobile
[12:06:10] <robertmaxrees> jquery mobile uses jquery
[12:06:23] <SmashingX> ok I understand that
[12:06:33] <robertmaxrees> put differently, there's no simple answer.
[12:06:51] <SmashingX> are they both compatible?
[12:07:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery mobile relies on jquery.
[12:07:05] <SmashingX> so whatever I design in jquery I can see it with jquery mobile?
[12:07:05] <robertmaxrees> sooo...
[12:07:16] <robertmaxrees> you don't design anything "in jquery"
[12:07:35] <SmashingX> well use jquery if you want it to be rephrased
[12:07:52] <robertmaxrees> you're still asking a kind of backwards question.
[12:08:14] <SmashingX> ?
[12:08:26] <robertmaxrees> you can develop things that will work on mobile using just jquery.
[12:08:33] <robertmaxrees> you can also use jquery mobile for that work.
[12:08:34] <SmashingX> I just want to know if there are things that I cannot do in jquery but I can do in jquery mobile
[12:08:51] <SmashingX> so what would be the difference in that case?
[12:09:00] <robertmaxrees> anything you can do in jquery mobile you can technically do in native jquery - jqmobile makes it a lot "easier"/
[12:09:13] <SmashingX> oh got it
[12:10:02] <SmashingX> so basically what I cant to develop is a table on the right side of the screen containing data and a slide pane on the left with filters
[12:10:12] <SmashingX> and I would like  to use jquery mobile for that
[12:10:16] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[12:10:25] <SmashingX> is there an easy way to do it like you said?
[12:10:46] <SmashingX> I found this: http://codyhouse.co/demo/content-filter/index.html
[12:10:53] <SmashingX> pretty similar to what I want
[12:11:00] <robertmaxrees> there are ways to accomplish that, yes.  depending on your familiarity with progrmaming, javascript, mobile, etc, it can be pretty easy.
[12:11:06] <SmashingX> the only difference is that I would like to have a table on the right side
[12:11:55] <robertmaxrees> why a table?
[12:12:06] <robertmaxrees> tables are pretty inflexible with styling.
[12:12:07] <SmashingX> why? Because I ned it that way?
[12:12:26] <robertmaxrees> do you have tabular data?
[12:12:31] <SmashingX> no
[12:12:38] <robertmaxrees> then don't use a table if you can avoid it.
[12:12:45] <SmashingX> I will have a list of people
[12:12:50] <SmashingX> for exmaple
[12:13:01] <robertmaxrees> the <table> tag is really inflexible, so using it is likely not what you want to do.
[12:13:04] <samssh> Then you would use a list.
[12:13:05] <SmashingX> with their first name, last name and salary for example
[12:13:15] <robertmaxrees> how would it be displayed?
[12:14:18] <SmashingX> like an excel spreadsheet
[12:14:23] <SmashingX> the same thing
[12:14:26] <robertmaxrees> then you do have tabular data.
[12:14:44] <robertmaxrees> it's going to be very hard to have the animations and stuff you want - check out datatables.
[12:14:54] <robertmaxrees> a lot of people seem to like it, and it should fit the bill for what you need.
[12:15:51] <SmashingX> ok, is there an example you might have that I can use as a template?
[12:16:06] <robertmaxrees> the datatables site should have everything you need.
[12:16:21] <SmashingX> what databases site?
[12:16:25] <robertmaxrees> datatables
[12:17:51] <SmashingX> I don’t get it
[12:17:57] <samssh> http://www.datatables.net/
[12:18:23] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:19:01] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX google is your friend.
[12:19:23] <SmashingX> no is not
[12:19:26] <SmashingX> google spy
[12:19:41] <SmashingX> I don’t use google since 2 years ago
[12:19:44] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:19:51] <robertmaxrees> alright - whatever search engine you want, then.
[12:20:06] <baako> hi i have some dat at looks like 4343.43243423. I want to cut them up into 3 different variables where you see the . what function can i use?
[12:20:11] <Robdgreat> inb4 "no, all search engine spy"
[12:20:22] <robertmaxrees> baako "three different variables"?
[12:20:25] <robertmaxrees> or two?
[12:20:54] <robertmaxrees> check out string.split(), either way.
[12:20:56] <robertmaxrees> !mdn string.split
[12:21:01] <baako> robertmaxrees: 3 forgot to add another . somewhere
[12:21:02] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: String.prototype.split() - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[12:21:30] <baako> thanks robertmaxrees
[12:22:00] <samssh> 'whois SmashingX
[12:22:13] <samssh> OOPS...
[12:22:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:22:20] <SmashingX> wtf
[12:22:28] <SmashingX> stalking on me?
[12:22:31] <SmashingX> :P
[12:23:07] <samssh> Yep, I'm totally stalking you and stuff.
[12:23:17] <samssh> </sarcasm>
[12:23:58] <SmashingX> I don’t care Im well protected :P
[12:24:03] <SmashingX> I don’t think you can see much
[12:24:24] <baako> robertmaxrees: can i split it into a variable or does it have to go into an array?
[12:24:48] <robertmaxrees> baako you can assign variables to the array indexes afterward if you want.
[12:25:18] <samssh> SmashingX, I'm pretty sure you can feed out an IP, but I wouldn't be surprised if you were behind a proxy service.
[12:25:29] <Robdgreat> he's behind 7 proxies!!1!1!1
[12:25:37] <SmashingX> samssh: Im not behind of a proxy server
[12:26:23] <samssh> SmashingX, So, out of curiosity, what Search Engine do you use? DDG?
[12:26:28] <SmashingX> yep
[12:27:25] <SmashingX> although I wasn’t not happy when I knew they partnered with yandex
[12:27:35] <SmashingX> *wasn’t happy
[12:35:02] <baako> robertmaxrees: how do i store the result into varibles and use it outside the loop http://jsfiddle.net/baako/ben3mmjq/
[12:35:25] <robertmaxrees> err...
[12:35:27] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[12:35:58] <robertmaxrees> for each iteration of the loop you'll smash over your vars.
[12:36:07] <robertmaxrees> will you always have three indexes?
[12:36:14] <baako> robertmaxrees: yes
[12:36:22] <robertmaxrees> then don't use the loop.
[12:36:30] <robertmaxrees> just access the array indexes directly to do the assignment.
[12:41:52] <baako> robertmaxrees: tried to do it the php explode way like http://jsfiddle.net/baako/ben3mmjq/1/
[12:41:55] <baako> failed
[12:42:04] <robertmaxrees> .
[12:42:09] <robertmaxrees> they're array indexes dude.
[12:42:12] <robertmaxrees> [0]

[13:01:20] <kevireilly> yucky yuck. So, I've got a browser issue where a click event is not trigger if you mousedown an element and then mouseup in a child node. I've got a shim that tracks what was mousedown'd on and evaluates if it is the same element on mouseup which then triggers a click.
[13:01:45] <kevireilly> Great, works, but this also means that click events are fired twice when the source issue is not at play. Presently I'm solving this poorly and I'm curious if anyone has any alternate ideas
[13:02:14] <robertmaxrees> can you share a fiddle that replicates the bug?
[13:02:23] <robertmaxrees> something to play with
[13:03:49] <ThePendulum> Odd, I set .error() on images but it isn't triggered :(
[13:04:03] <robertmaxrees> ThePendulum images are funky with callbvacks.
[13:04:50] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: definitely, will have to try it in safari specifically to replicate. And I just found out I'm being pulled into a meeting, are you going to be around in an hour or so?
[13:04:55] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[13:04:58] <robertmaxrees> i don't have a mac.
[13:05:12] <kevireilly> ah gotcha, and on latest windows the 2013 safari for windows doesn't seem to work at al
[13:05:25] <robertmaxrees> windows 8?
[13:09:53] <ThePendulum> Odd
[13:09:57] <ThePendulum> I can fire a console log, but nothing else
[13:10:01] <ThePendulum> not even an alert or something
[13:11:15] <ThePendulum> hmm got something now
[13:11:21] <ThePendulum> odd, an alert specifically doesn't work
[13:11:42] <robertmaxrees> good ;)
[13:35:00] <DarkGhost> hello all, I'm trying to upload an image via jquery async.. It's posting the image but then coming back with errorThrown:SyntaxError: Unexpected token o, heres the code: privatepaste.com/ef65f67c00
[13:35:01] <DarkGhost> any help?
[13:35:31] <claytonzaugg> Is there a way i can get the height of parent divs up to the very top element, or <body>?
[13:36:04] <BillCriswell> claytonzaugg: $('body').height() ?
[13:36:53] <claytonzaugg> I'm trying to get all the heights, so I can then take the document height and subtract the sum of the parent DIV heights and make the last div equal to that height
[13:37:14] <claytonzaugg> so for example if the document is 1000 and the above divs are total of 300, the last div would then equal 700px for height
[13:37:50] <claytonzaugg> BillCriswell, I don't need to know the body height, but all the parents my very nested div
[13:38:18] <BillCriswell> I'm not following.
[13:38:34] <BillCriswell> Can you show me on jsbin.com ?
[13:38:45] <claytonzaugg> sure one sec
[13:38:52] <BillCriswell> You're saying "parents" but also saying "above"
[13:38:59] <claytonzaugg> sorry
[13:39:14] <claytonzaugg> still novice at all of this
[13:39:23] <BillCriswell> It's all good.
[13:41:28] <claytonzaugg> hmm, I'll have to make something to show as example, this code is NDA so give me a sec to fake it BillCriswell
[13:41:38] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[13:46:34] <DarkGhost> anyone?
[13:46:41] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell possibly know?
[13:46:59] <_DB> how can I format this to just show the date 2015-02-11 00:00:00
[13:47:48] <BillCriswell> _DB: Think you forgot to share something.
[13:47:51] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: Not sure.
[13:48:45] <_DB> whoop
[13:48:52] <_DB> to show the date only
[13:48:55] <_DB> remove the time
[13:49:22] <BillCriswell> So you have "2015-02-11 00:00:00" and you want "2015-02-11" ?
[13:50:00] <BillCriswell> "2015-02-11 00:00:00".split(' ')[0] would do the trick
[13:50:48] <_DB> so if im getting that value from this  data.beacon[0]['advertisings'][key]['ad_start_date']
[13:50:59] <_DB> I would do  data.beacon[0]['advertisings'][key]['ad_start_date'].split(' ')[0]
[13:51:09] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:51:40] <DarkGhost> ugh
[13:54:12] <_DB> cool it worked thanks
[13:55:04] <BillCriswell> _DB: No problem.
[14:00:41] <_DB> anyway I could pass that date to a function to change its format?
[14:02:04] <BillCriswell> _DB: With JS it's never fun unless you're using moment, but yeah you can.
[15:16:49] <SmashingX> How can I look the top and the riht of a table with jqeury mobile, any suggestions?
[15:17:01] <robertmaxrees> the what?
[15:17:49] <Lehl0r> why would someone use tables :-)
[15:17:57] <robertmaxrees> he has tabular data in this case
[15:18:14] <robertmaxrees> smashingx you want the offset() of the table.
[15:20:52] <Lehl0r> maybe that is what your looking for :
[15:20:53] <Lehl0r> http://jsfiddle.net/jmosbech/stFcx/
[15:21:24] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:22:12] <Lehl0r> oh i thought he ment lock the table
[15:23:21] <Lehl0r> could not get the context out of "how can i look the top..."
[15:28:57] <SmashingX> Lehl0r: That’s exactly what Im looking for
[15:28:58] <SmashingX> thanks
[15:29:16] <baako> hi why cant  i access table_code and channel in the ajax? http://kopy.io/MHAO8 am getting Uncaught ReferenceError: table_code is not defined
[15:29:23] <robertmaxrees> well done haha
[15:29:46] <robertmaxrees> baako because table_code doesn't exist outside of that function.
[15:29:53] <robertmaxrees> scope.
[15:30:03] <robertmaxrees> define it beforehand.
[15:30:47] <baako> i cant because the things i need to use is in that nfc.addNdefListener
[15:31:28] <robertmaxrees> you're likely SOL then.
[15:32:28] <robertmaxrees> you can try declaring the var beforehand and then setting it within that first function, but something tells me that function is async.
[15:32:44] <Lehl0r> :-)
[15:34:08] <baako> robertmaxrees: yep
[15:37:29] <baako> so am screw robertmaxrees
[15:37:56] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you might need to rethink the problem, but this particular route, yeah.
[15:39:00] <baako> robertmaxrees: can i not assign the table_code to a var outside that function?
[15:39:17] <baako> like you can do in most programming language?
[15:39:17] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:39:37] <robertmaxrees> i just said you can try declaring it beforehand and then set it in that first function, but if that first function is async, that's not going to work.
[15:39:49] <robertmaxrees> because the var won't get set in time.
[15:39:56] <robertmaxrees> and you'll have a race condition.
[15:41:07] <baako> robertmaxrees: like in php u can do this http://kopy.io/PYqnB
[15:41:14] <robertmaxrees> again.
[15:41:20] <robertmaxrees> is that first function async?
[15:42:30] <baako> it just readers an nfc tags and store the value of that nfc tag
[15:42:43] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question
[15:42:54] <baako> async has in true or false?
[15:43:04] <robertmaxrees> is that first function async?
[15:43:27] <robertmaxrees> per the rules of scoping in javascript, you can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jmn477gz/
[15:43:54] <robertmaxrees> however, if those functions are async, you're going to have a race condition occur where the first might not "complete" before the second runs.
[15:44:12] <baako> i dont understand different of async
[15:44:24] <robertmaxrees> async code is code that first but doens't block execution.
[15:44:25] <robertmaxrees> like ajax.
[15:45:04] <robertmaxrees> *first = fires.
[15:47:06] <baako> robertmaxrees: so code that run first but doesnt stop the others from firing?
[15:47:19] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[15:47:24] <baako> if that the code then no but the other code do depend on it
[15:47:39] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:47:53] <robertmaxrees> if that first function isn't async, then look at the fiddle i just shared.
[15:48:13] <baako> because that function runs when you phone comes in contract with an nfc tag then i get the value and send it via ajax
[15:48:28] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:48:39] <robertmaxrees> you need to check the documentation of this library or whatever and see if any of that is async.
[15:51:31] <baako> robertmaxrees: how is that gonna work thought because this is how the function works nfc.addNdefFormatableListener(callback, [onSuccess], [onFailure]);
[15:51:45] <baako> the ajax runs in the onSuncess
[15:51:48] <robertmaxrees> go read the docs.
[15:52:06] <robertmaxrees> you're asking me questions that you should really be reading documentation for.
[16:01:20] <baako> robertmaxrees: i have yo
[16:06:56] <maletor> Is there any way to convert this $("[data-result]").val JSON.stringify(data.result) to *not* use json stringification but instead create form inputs that represent the keys and values?
[16:07:17] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[16:07:40] <robertmaxrees> what does the data look like?
[16:09:50] <compact> hey guys. I've got a table, and some jquery where it adds another row when you click on a certain button. however, some of the text boxes in the row calc and output to another textbox in the row. how can i make sure the correct values go in the correct row
[16:10:34] <Woet> compact: reproduce it on www.jsfiddle.net
[16:10:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we cna't see your code.
[16:20:01] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/y9csep5g/ <-- if i 'Add new Product' then fill out its weight, length etc
[16:20:03] <compact> nothing changes
[16:20:14] <robertmaxrees> holy woah
[16:20:37] <robertmaxrees> and that's becuase you're binding to things that don't yet exist.
[16:20:38] <compact> I'm new to jquery :P
[16:20:45] <compact> well it works for the first row
[16:20:47] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:20:49] <robertmaxrees> the rest don't.
[16:20:56] <compact> correct
[16:21:00] <robertmaxrees> becuase they don't yet exist - you need to use the delegated syntax of .on()
[16:21:40] <robertmaxrees> $('table').on('keyup', '.freight-qty', function() {}); etc.
[16:21:48] <robertmaxrees> also, don't do :input.freight-qty if you can avoid it.
[16:22:02] <compact> how come?
[16:22:06] <robertmaxrees> it's slow.
[16:22:08] <robertmaxrees> just select the class.
[16:22:09] <compact> ah ok
[16:23:39] <robertmaxrees> also, don't do href="javascript:void(0);"
[16:27:05] <robertmaxrees> also, you could just clone that tr from the current one and append that instead.
[16:27:20] <compact> oo
[16:29:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y9csep5g/1/
[16:29:56] <robertmaxrees> with less broken: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y9csep5g/2/
[16:30:52] <compact> wow
[16:30:54] <compact> heaps cleaner
[16:31:12] <robertmaxrees> that makes some assumptions but it's easier.
[16:31:37] <compact> thanks so much, now just to get the weight to calculate in the correct box etc
[16:32:06] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't use IDs here.
[16:32:26] <compact> Name instead?
[16:32:34] <robertmaxrees> or class.
[16:32:39] <compact> I'm going to end up changing the name to [] etc
[16:32:41] <neanderslob> hi all, I'm having trouble getting the jquery sort table plugin to work with a table that I'm generating with a loop
[16:32:43] <compact> so i can loop it in PHP
[16:32:54] <robertmaxrees> compact worry about that later.
[16:33:07] <robertmaxrees> build good markup first.
[16:33:15] <neanderslob> I've basically outlined the situation here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28477106/issues-with-the-jquery-tablesorter-gem (but I've tried manually installing the plugin without the ruby gem as well)
[16:33:43] <neanderslob> I was wondering if anyone might be able to see anything that's obviously wrong
[16:33:57] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob check the rendered html instead.
[16:34:00] <robertmaxrees> that's all the JS sees.
[16:35:20] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: fair point, the html renders with the necessary ids, and table components (thead, tbody etc) necessary for the plugin to run
[16:35:42] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: firebug also confirms that jquery-tablesorter does load
[16:35:57] <robertmaxrees> you're basically asking us to troubleshoot blind without that.
[16:36:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd setup a fiddle.
[16:37:32] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: it would be a little difficult to set up a fiddle for this situation because I'm using ruby to create the table through a loop
[16:37:46] <robertmaxrees> which is why you copy the rendered markup instead.
[16:37:50] <robertmaxrees> from within the browser.
[16:38:33] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: alright, that makes sense
[16:41:42] <compact> robertmaxrees, just trying to understand what you wrote. the name="two" in the freight-weight
[16:41:47] <compact> what does the two do?
[16:41:55] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/y9csep5g/3/
[16:42:04] <compact> as I'm trying to add new one freight-height
[16:42:07] <compact> and playing around with it
[16:45:19] <guideX> why would addclass not work
[16:45:47] <guideX> if I console.log, I can see it, but it's addclass not working
[16:45:54] <SmashingX> Lehl0r: That’s weird Im trying to reproduce the link you gave me in jsfiddle but I cant make it work :(
[16:47:06] <robertmaxrees> guideX misspelled class?
[16:47:10] <robertmaxrees> what isn't working about it?
[16:47:34] <guideX> well, when I inspect the object, the class isn't added
[16:47:35] <robertmaxrees> compact i was just saying you should use IDs since you'd wind up accidentally replicating them.
[16:48:04] <guideX> and can't see the css changes that should be there
[16:48:12] <robertmaxrees> bad selector, then?
[16:48:21] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[16:48:24] <guideX> well I see the object when I console.log
[16:48:29] <guideX> no errors
[16:48:35] <robertmaxrees> do a .length
[16:48:44] <guideX> I do this.. var h = $("#" + menuId).find(".heading");  then $(h).addClass("heading");
[16:48:45] <guideX> ok
[16:48:45] <robertmaxrees> you can get an empty object that's still an objkect.
[16:48:58] <robertmaxrees> you don't need $(h) btw - just h
[16:49:03] <guideX> ah ok
[16:49:04] <robertmaxrees> it's already a jquery object.
[16:49:59] <guideX> when I do h.length, I see 1
[16:50:03] <guideX> in the console
[16:50:20] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[16:50:24] <robertmaxrees> h already has that class.
[16:50:34] <guideX> oh duh lol
[16:50:48] <guideX> ok it works fine now, lol
[16:51:00] <guideX> h.addClass("highlighted");
[16:51:05] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[16:51:09] <guideX> thanks guys (feel kinda dumb though)
[16:51:14] <robertmaxrees> also, you should probably use more descriptive var names.
[16:51:23] <robertmaxrees> like $heading instead of just h
[16:51:32] <guideX> well this is just test variables
[16:51:34] <guideX> but yes
[16:51:36] <guideX> I will
[16:53:44] <robertmaxrees> compact so which part of your code isn't working as expected?
[16:55:53] <compact> ah, I've got it working how i want, except for the jquery going into the new rows
[16:56:03] <robertmaxrees> oh i get it - you need to base all those calculations off the currently changed input - you can get that within your event handlers off the $(this) object.
[16:56:06] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/y9csep5g/4/
[16:56:09] <robertmaxrees> which will represent the changed input.
[16:56:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, for that you need to use delegated listeners.
[16:56:59] <robertmaxrees> so you have two problems :) check out http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for the first one.
[16:57:14] <sung> i will immediately say i don't know jquery so well, i have a dumb question: "$('select#open_2216022').parent().parent().prev().prev().children().slice(1).children().slice(0).html()" --- is this how jquery is supposed to look for what i'm doing
[16:57:25] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:57:30] <sung> i did not think so
[16:57:36] <sung> whay would the right way look for something like that
[16:58:19] <robertmaxrees> $('#open_2216022').closest('.whateverParentItShoudBe').find('.theChildYouCareAbout').html();
[16:58:44] <robertmaxrees> sung make a fiddle of your code if that doesn't make sense.
[16:59:31] <sung> robertmaxrees: ah, you're assuming that things are labeled correctly, but i'm probably gonna end up doing this in greasemonkey
[16:59:44] <robertmaxrees> you're still likely overcomplicating it
[16:59:48] <sung> mm
[16:59:57] <robertmaxrees> familiarize yourself with closest, find, filter, etc.
[17:00:22] <robertmaxrees> doiung a lot of chained .parent(), .prev(), and similar calls is code smell.
[17:00:27] <sung> robertmaxrees: okay
[17:00:44] <compact> robertmaxrees, and the second one? :P
[17:01:11] <robertmaxrees> compact get the current tr by using $(this).closest('tr') and then .find() the elements you need from there.
[17:03:31] <robertmaxrees> also, parseInt takes two arguments, not one.
[17:11:17] <SmashingX> I don’t understand how can I make this work in my server http://jsfiddle.net/jmosbech/stFcx/ somebody?
[17:11:19] <Jesuso> Is there a way to make pages load inside the <div role="main" class="ui-content">, without loosing the header and footer?, or I have to create my own method to do such thing?
[17:11:27] <SmashingX> Do I have to call an initial function?
[17:12:02] <robertmaxrees> Jesuso context?
[17:12:33] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX what about it doesn't work?
[17:13:01] <SmashingX> what I mean by doesn’t work is that I have the table but it’s not executing the Javascript code
[17:13:12] <robertmaxrees> are you getting console errors?
[17:13:20] <robertmaxrees> do you have the js properly included after the table?
[17:13:21] <SmashingX> or in other words the top rows are not locked to the top
[17:13:32] <robertmaxrees> show your version.
[17:13:40] <SmashingX> ok hold on
[17:16:14] <Jesuso> robertmaxrees I would like to create an app with a fixed header, panel (left menu) and a footer, and just modify the content when links are clicked.
[17:16:25] <robertmaxrees> easy - ajax.
[17:16:34] <robertmaxrees> you can use .load() to do that if you want.
[17:16:39] <Jesuso> Otherwise I would have to copy and paste header, panel and footer on every single page.
[17:16:48] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:16:57] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: here's the fiddle for the jquery tablesort issue: https://jsfiddle.net/se3zcge3/2/ (I'm new at making fiddles so please do let me know if I'm not doing something correctly)
[17:16:59] <robertmaxrees> your server-side language should do that for you.
[17:17:23] <Jesuso> Ok, I was just wondering if there was already a way to do it "native" on jQueryMobile, thanks
[17:17:25] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob you include the plugin via the "external resources"
[17:17:33] <robertmaxrees> Jesuso oh! yues
[17:17:52] <robertmaxrees> iirc there IS a way to do that with JQM.
[17:18:16] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: do I just copy the location of the js file on github?
[17:18:35] <robertmaxrees> you need to use rawgit to do that.
[17:20:10] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: gotcha should I do that now, or is it workable as it stands?
[17:20:18] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: this is my main html page: http://pastebin.com/ai1aHhtS
[17:20:19] <robertmaxrees> it's throwing an error right now.
[17:20:42] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX ... can you link me to the place where it's broken?
[17:20:59] <SmashingX> the place where is broken?
[17:21:09] <SmashingX> you mean a URL or something?
[17:21:11] <robertmaxrees> the actual page?  i need a functioning version.
[17:21:15] <robertmaxrees> not a pastebin link.
[17:21:29] <baako> damn that has to be one of the best things i have done in jquery :p
[17:21:31] <SmashingX> oh no I’m opening that file in my local server
[17:21:37] <robertmaxrees> then do a fiddle :)
[17:21:49] <SmashingX> the fiddle is already there :(
[17:21:54] <SmashingX> well let me do it again
[17:22:57] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/w0fsvmu5/
[17:23:25] <robertmaxrees> are you including jquery anywhere on your page?
[17:24:40] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: huh, so I updated the added the resoureces in the fiddle via rawgit and suddenly the fiddle is working
[17:24:48] <SmashingX> yes
[17:24:57] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX i'm not seeing it on that fiddle.
[17:25:12] <SmashingX> I updated it
[17:25:17] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob sounds like you're not including things in the right order.
[17:25:19] <SmashingX> http://jsfiddle.net/w0fsvmu5/3/
[17:25:34] <robertmaxrees> notice how the fiddle works?
[17:25:51] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: yes but that was when I set the no wrap - in <body>
[17:26:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:26:02] <SmashingX> I had jequery 1.7.2 selected
[17:26:05] <robertmaxrees> this is getting circular.
[17:26:18] <robertmaxrees> your pastebin doesn't show you including jquery anywhere.
[17:26:20] <SmashingX> but it didn’t work until I chose that option
[17:26:29] <sung> robertmaxrees: $('select#open_2216022').closest('tr').prev().prev().find('td.nowrap').find('b').html()
[17:26:49] <robertmaxrees> sung that still looks hacky to me.
[17:26:55] <sung> robertmaxrees: so, that's about the shortest i can make it...i'm trying to go back two tr's
[17:27:05] <robertmaxrees> check out .filter()
[17:27:09] <SmashingX> you are right man
[17:27:16] <SmashingX> that was another version of the original
[17:27:21] <SmashingX> where I have this:    <script src="jquery.mobile-1.3.2.min.js"></script>
[17:27:57] <SmashingX> but I think I have to add jquery version
[17:28:01] <SmashingX> no jquery mobile
[17:28:58] <SmashingX> or jquery mobile would do it?
[17:29:52] <sung> robertmaxrees: i just hunted down a random class entry
[17:29:58] <sung> that i somehow missed on before
[17:33:05] <SmashingX> what the option of no wrap - in <head> mean?
[17:33:14] <SmashingX> I mean how can I apply that to my website
[17:36:58] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX make sure you have jquery, the plugin, then your code./
[17:38:02] <SmashingX> yes but in the jsfiddle if you change the option No wrap - in <body> the first row doesn’t get lock to the top
[17:38:12] <SmashingX> so Im trying to figure out what does that mean
[17:38:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:38:37] <robertmaxrees> open the console on your site.
[17:38:40] <robertmaxrees> ignore the fiddle yo.
[17:39:13] <robertmaxrees> see any errors?
[17:42:11] <SmashingX>  Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[17:42:15] <SmashingX> whaaa?
[17:42:17] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:42:29] <robertmaxrees> the pastebin you shared doesn't show you adding in jquery anywhere.
[17:42:43] <SmashingX> yes but in my main project it does hav eit
[17:42:55] <SmashingX> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js">
[17:42:56] <SmashingX>     </script>
[17:42:56] <robertmaxrees> make sure the plugin and your code come AFTER the include, then.
[17:43:12] <SmashingX> doesn’t that look like jquery to you?
[17:43:22] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean you're running that before your other code.
[17:43:38] <SmashingX> I have it on the head part
[17:43:52] <robertmaxrees> that needs to come before any other javascript.
[17:44:03] <robertmaxrees> any other javascript that uses jquery, at least.
[17:46:24] <SmashingX> haha
[17:46:34] <SmashingX> I’ll put it before </htm>
[17:46:38] <SmashingX> aaggg
[17:46:43] <robertmaxrees> that'll make things worse...
[17:46:49] <SmashingX> Im just kidding lol
[17:47:05] <SmashingX> but this thing is making me crazy
[17:47:13] <robertmaxrees> do a fixee of the page code.
[17:47:17] <robertmaxrees> or a pastebin,w hatever.
[17:48:39] <SmashingX> Ok Im going to paste my main file
[17:48:59] <SmashingX> http://pastebin.com/KBTmD72F
[17:49:34] <SmashingX> it seems like it gets sticky to the top of the page but it doesn’t go down :/
[17:49:56] <robertmaxrees> put jquery mobile before index.js
[17:50:27] <robertmaxrees> also - is noconflict mode turned on?
[17:50:36] <SmashingX> I did that
[17:50:41] <SmashingX> but it gives me this error
[17:50:57] <SmashingX> http://pastebin.com/J2dWY2v8
[17:51:17] <robertmaxrees> you have another problem, then.
[17:51:33] <robertmaxrees> is noconflict mode turned on?
[17:52:24] <SmashingX> where?
[17:52:33] <SmashingX> sorry but I don’t know about that
[17:52:35] <SmashingX> chrome?
[17:52:41] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[17:52:53] <robertmaxrees> go to your console and do jQuery.noConflict()
[17:52:56] <robertmaxrees> what do you get back?
[17:53:27] <SmashingX> function (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)}
[17:53:50] <robertmaxrees> try to do $.fn.jquery
[17:54:47] <SmashingX> 1.7.2
[17:54:48] <robertmaxrees> you've basically got some kind of fundamental issue causing your headaches.
[17:55:03] <robertmaxrees> so we need to figure out what that is.
[17:55:09] <SmashingX> I changed the order of the files and now the table works
[17:55:15] <robertmaxrees> what's the current error?
[17:55:17] <robertmaxrees> *order
[17:55:43] <SmashingX> jquery at the end
[17:55:44] <ednorton> shouldnt index.js be after jquerymoblie
[17:55:51] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX O.o
[17:55:56] <robertmaxrees> then you're loading jquery somewhere else.
[17:56:01] <robertmaxrees> you're loading it twice.
[17:56:43] <SmashingX> O_o
[17:56:58] <SmashingX> that doesn’t make sense because then it would have worked before
[17:57:23] <SmashingX> and I get errors at the console
[17:57:29] <SmashingX>  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'mobile' of undefined
[17:57:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[17:57:36] <SmashingX>  Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[17:57:36] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[17:57:45] <robertmaxrees> you've got something else going on.
[17:57:49] <robertmaxrees> audit your JS files.
[17:58:47] <SmashingX> If I delete    <script src="index.js"></script>
[17:58:51] <SmashingX> then I got only one error
[17:58:57] <robertmaxrees> it should be jquery, jquery mobile, any plugins, then your code.
[17:58:58] <SmashingX> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'mobile' of undefined
[17:59:00] <robertmaxrees> that should be the order.
[17:59:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's because jquery needs to come before jquery mobile.
[17:59:15] <ednorton> does index.js rely on anything in jquery or jquerymobile
[17:59:27] <ednorton> you included it BEFORE jquerymobile
[18:00:13] <SmashingX> this is index.js: http://pastebin.com/YDS9XeDz
[18:00:38] <ednorton> index.js has to be included last
[18:00:42] <ednorton> jquery
[18:00:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:00:47] <ednorton> then jquerymobile
[18:00:52] <ednorton> then index.js
[18:00:54] <robertmaxrees> jquery, then jquery mobile, then any plugins, then your code.
[18:01:42] <jeffmjack> is it better for performance to inject a new div, or use hide/show for stuff hardcoded into index.html?
[18:01:47] <SmashingX> and I still have to make the first row to get lock to the left side :(
[18:01:55] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack showing/hiding, gennerally.
[18:02:21] <robertmaxrees> you're fixating on the wrong things, SmashingX
[18:02:24] <jeffmjack> including if the div is question is basically just an img?
[18:02:36] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack generally, yeah.  really depends though.
[18:02:52] <robertmaxrees> however, do whatever is easiest.
[18:02:58] <jeffmjack> hmmm ok. thx robertmaxrees you are a boss
[18:02:58] <robertmaxrees> worry about performance later - focus on readability
[18:03:13] <jeffmjack> ok
[18:04:20] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: see this page: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/examples/panels/panel-swipe-open.html#demo-page
[18:04:29] <ednorton> why do so many programmers like K&R formatting over allman?
[18:04:32] <SmashingX> this is the one using that js that is failing
[18:04:46] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX that page works...
[18:04:51] <SmashingX> I know
[18:04:58] <ednorton> allman is much more readable
[18:05:04] <robertmaxrees> i disagree :)
[18:05:05] <SmashingX> and it was working in my case until I added the table thing
[18:05:07] <robertmaxrees> at least for js.
[18:05:20] <ednorton> K&R was created when linespace was limited
[18:05:35] <robertmaxrees> ednorton http://jsfiddle.net/jyxh0qbb/
[18:05:37] <ednorton> I rememer those days ive been programming since 81
[18:05:56] <robertmaxrees> ednorton also, JS is a special snowflake with weird whitespace problems.
[18:06:20] <ednorton> robert is so much easier to match braces
[18:06:26] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[18:06:59] <ednorton> well any modern IDE editor will match braces etc, but im just talking a quick look with the eye
[18:07:06] <robertmaxrees> ednorton did you look at that fiddle?>
[18:07:13] <ednorton> I glanced at it
[18:07:17] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[18:08:19] <ednorton> well id loose the braces on the if
[18:08:23] <ednorton> as its only one line
[18:08:31] <robertmaxrees> not in javascript i wouldn't.
[18:08:40] <robertmaxrees> but do you see where the bug is in that code?
[18:08:44] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: could you try it in your localhost?
[18:08:49] <ednorton> actually all in the for too
[18:08:54] <ednorton> as there is only the if
[18:08:58] <ednorton> in the forloop
[18:09:05] <robertmaxrees> ednorton you shouldn't use for loops anyway in js.
[18:09:10] <robertmaxrees> but you're ignoring my point ;)
[18:09:17] <robertmaxrees> open your console and see the error.
[18:09:28] <robertmaxrees> lots of people miss errors exactly like this all the time.
[18:09:49] <robertmaxrees> for most people I know (you might be different), 1tb is much easier than allman.
[18:09:51] <ednorton> robertmaxrees I wasnt looking for a code error
[18:10:23] <robertmaxrees> my entire point was the code error - you get the console log even though you think you shouldn't.
[18:10:37] <robertmaxrees> one misplaced semi is the issue.  1tb makes that much more apparent imo.
[18:13:57] <ednorton> I havent done any webdev since 2000 when I went back into doing more traditional programming
[18:14:13] <ednorton> actually just learning jquery, html5, css etc now
[18:14:15] <ednorton> heh
[18:14:34] <ednorton> a lot has changed
[18:14:37] <robertmaxrees> if you want to get into the pedantry of the right way to do this example, i would've done something like this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mnb9104b/1/
[18:14:40] <robertmaxrees> and yes, a lot has changed.
[18:15:09] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go home.
[18:26:58] <ednorton> I actually wrote my first cgi in C!
[18:45:53] <Dombot9000> Hi guys - new here and I hope it's okay to post a quick question. I'm within a .change() block and I'm enabling/disabling radio buttons dependent upon what value was selected from the dropdown (the change) but the disabling/enabling only happens after I click the radio button. It's as if I need one more event to trigger the DOM to reload? itself or something. I'll post a paste: http://pastebin.com/NL7Urcii
[18:46:12] <jeffmjack> why am I getting an 'undefined is not a function' error here? http://jsfiddle.net/jeffmjack/nhdmhgfn/
[18:46:45] <Dombot9000> Needs to be $(this)
[18:46:50] <Dombot9000> not this
[18:47:08] <jeffmjack> ah thank you
[18:47:20] <Dombot9000> Also you should use the # class selector
[18:47:23] <Dombot9000> as opposed to . name
[18:47:25] <Dombot9000> class is faster
[18:47:40] <jeffmjack> I thought # was for IDs
[18:54:31] <Dombot9000> Sorry yes for IDs
[18:55:02] <Dombot9000> Got my words muddled but long story short, ID is faster as it's native to the browser. http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[19:28:30] <jumpman> any way I can get tags.append('<span>'+tag+'<i data-tag="'+tag+'">x</i></span>') to stop making it <span>tag<br><br><i>x</i>?
[19:47:54] <eskatrem> Hey, what are frameworks (angular, backbone, etc.) for exactly?
[19:55:12] <Robdgreat> to ensure that if someone happens to not have js enabled, no part of your site will work
[19:55:16] <Robdgreat> luddite bastards
[19:55:41] <eskatrem> the framework, you mean?
[19:56:02] <Robdgreat> yeah, that was me just being cynical. not a serious answer to your question
[19:56:50] <eskatrem> ah, that's what I thought.
[19:57:29] <Robdgreat> one thing a client-side framework accomplishes is perhaps reducing latency by reducing the amount of data pulled in from the server
[19:57:36] <eskatrem> Seriously, I made some stuff in jquery, and I read about Angular or others sometimes, but I dont know what I would gain from using it (compared to the time I'd lose learning them)
[19:58:12] <Robdgreat> your server-side app just serves up actual data rather than markup much of the time (disclaimer: I've never used a client-side framework)
[19:58:24] <eskatrem> Robdgreat: you don't seem to like frameworks much?
[19:59:18] <Robdgreat> eskatrem: I run in some odd circles. plan 9 users who use mothra, a browser that doesn't support javascript
[19:59:28] <Robdgreat> so I see things from a bit of a different perspective.
[20:00:11] <Robdgreat> I'm not anti-framework, no
[20:00:19] <Robdgreat> I've just never used any client side ones
[20:02:39] <eskatrem> Robdgreat: wow, plan 9!
[20:03:08] <eskatrem> may I ask, why are you hanging out there if your browser doesnt support javascript?
[20:04:34] <Robdgreat> didn't say I ran mothra
[20:04:47] <Robdgreat> well, I do on occasion, but not primarily
[20:04:58] <Robdgreat> I chat with people who do, though
[20:07:42] <eskatrem> I am making a web page that displays maths questions (like "2+3*4"), and the user has to drag numbers to the others (like: dragging the 3 over the 4), and then a dialog box appears, asking how much is 3*4. the check is made server side and I am making indication, like an arrow going from the 3 to the 4.
[20:07:58] <eskatrem> I know this example seems trivial, but I am planning on adding more complicated maths
[20:08:18] <eskatrem> so basically I came here to know if a framework could help me with that.
[20:10:44] <Robdgreat> I'm inclined to think it might, but that's not definitive
[20:11:56] <eskatrem> Robdgreat: that's exactly what I am thinking, but Angular seems a tough one to learn
[20:35:04] <eskatrem> ok, maybe asking on the chan of the frameworks might get more answers
[20:43:22] <Velveeta> also, just because a framework might help with that, that doesn't mean angular is the right choice of framework for that job
[20:45:53] <eskatrem> Velveeta: true, but first I want to know what frameworks can do exactly
[20:46:53] <compact> hi, spoke to somebody earlier, but forgot where he directed me to
[20:46:53] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y9csep5g/2/
[20:47:03] <compact> how can i make each new row, still do the calculation
[20:47:09] <compact> if i enter fields into "qtr" and 'weight"
[20:47:20] <Velveeta> frameworks help with code organization more than anything else
[20:47:49] <eskatrem> Velveeta: doesn't sound so great then...
[20:47:56] <Velveeta> they typically add some functional sugar to get rid of some boilerplate things and ease common tasks like event bindings, signaling, etc
[20:48:17] <eskatrem> wow, I don't even know what's signaling
[20:49:11] <Velveeta> it's similar to event binding, but instead of passively blasting out events to anonymous subscribers, it actively alerts its subscribers
[20:49:30] <Velveeta> it's essentially pub/sub without an event-based alert system
[20:49:52] <Velveeta> you subscribe directly to other components to be notified of changes, instead of listening for generic change events
[20:50:32] <Velveeta> but beyond that, frameworks like backbone can handle creating and destoying views in an easier way that writing raw javascript
[20:50:48] <Velveeta> and frameworks like marionette build on top of backbone to abstract away and automate even more of that behavior
[20:51:05] <snover> in one sentence, velveeta! good frameworks are designed keep you from doing the stupid things you’re going to try to do because you don’t know what you are doing.
[20:51:10] <Velveeta> angular has its own opinions about constructing components and services for them to use, and has a lot of voodoo under the hood
[20:51:36] <Velveeta> sure, if you don't feel like typing a novel i suppose you could say that :D
[20:52:00] <eskatrem> for signaling, you mean: let's say I have a text zone and I want some div to be green when the user has entered stuff in it, if I have the text zone modify the div (as opposite to the div listening to the text zone), that would be signaling?
[20:53:22] <Velveeta> not exactly, but close... if the text zone had a subscribe function that the div could hook into directly, and then when the text zone was modified, it called an alertSubscribers() function that looped over an array of everything that had registered for updates
[20:53:42] <Velveeta> then it could tell the other component that it had updated, and that component would handle whatever it was supposed to do
[20:53:55] <eskatrem> wow, that's pretty neat! I had no idea about that
[20:54:07] <Velveeta> i prefer event-based signaling to just pure signaling because it allows you to keep those components more loosely coupled
[20:54:26] <Velveeta> if component A has to know that component B exists in the page in order to subscribe to it, that creates a dependency link
[20:54:59] <Velveeta> if component A just listens for an event that component B broadcasts, then whether or not component B even exists doesn't really matter
[20:55:08] <Velveeta> if it never receives that event, it just never does anything
[20:55:40] <eskatrem> I can see why it would be useful. if I have a text zone and lots of elements are listening to it, I'd rather use signalling and handle the subsribtion from the text zone than check the listening of the elements one by one
[20:55:47] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y9csep5g/2/
[20:55:55] <compact> how can i make each new row, still do the calculation if i enter fields into "qtr" and 'weight"
[20:58:42] <Velveeta> compact: you'd want to delegate the keyup event listener to a higher container
[20:58:50] <Velveeta> like to the table itself
[20:59:04] <Velveeta> that way it would work on any row that was created
[20:59:28] <eskatrem> when creating a new element (in compact 's case: a row), is it possible to know the id of the new element?
[20:59:54] <Velveeta> so instead of something like $(':input.freight-weight').on('keyup', function () {, you would do something like $('#tbl1').on('keyup', ':input.freight-weight', function () {
[21:00:17] <Velveeta> eskatrem: if you're creating the new element, sure, you would specify the id of the new element yourself
[21:01:10] <Velveeta> compact: http://api.jquery.com/on/ ... read up on the delegated event section
[21:02:19] <eskatrem> so for compact 's problem, I was thinking of creating a new id for each row (like "row_"+row_number, row number being incremented each time) have the different fields have an idea like "product_code_"+row_number, and have the calculations done accordingly
[21:03:05] <eskatrem> like you would have #TL_cube_1 listening to #length_1, #width_1, #heigh_1
[21:04:14] <Velveeta> yeah, the problem with that approach is that depending on how large that table gets, you have to have N different sets of event listeners, and bind them up manually everytime a new row is created
[21:04:48] <Velveeta> if you delegate the event listener to a higher container, you get a single event listener for all rows, and you don't have to do any babysitting to make sure new rows have their listeners bound up as they're created, they just automatically work in the original one
[21:05:34] <eskatrem> manually? I thought the button create row would do: 1. create the buttons with new ideas 2. bing #TL_cube_N to #length_N, #width_N, #height_N  3. increment N
[21:06:16] <Velveeta> they would, but that's having to manually add that... it's obviously don't programmatically, but you have to write the code to bind it up
[21:06:47] <Velveeta> so if somebody later changes that for whatever reason, you then have broken functionality, so it's more fragile and more resource intensive than a delegated event listener
[21:07:12] <Velveeta> because if you have 1 row, there's just 1 listener, but if you have 10000 rows, there are now 10000 listeners... with a delegated listener, there's still just 1 listener no matter how many rows you have
[21:08:46] <eskatrem> oh, so you want to make a global function that listens to #length_1, #length_2,..., #height_N and knows which #volume needs to be modified?
[21:09:37] <compact> ok cleaned up a bit http://jsfiddle.net/compact72/w29gxmj8/
[21:09:45] <compact> its easier to use [] id's because of php
[21:10:10] <Velveeta> sort of, you bind an event listener to the table itself, and let the event bubble up from the row to the table, then just inspect what the target was, compare it to a selector, and if it matches, invoke the callback with that element as the scope
[21:10:29] <compact> wow, just started jquery lol
[21:10:33] <Velveeta> that's all taken care of behind the scenes for you by jquery, you just use a slightly different syntax when you bind up your event listener with .on()
[21:10:43] <jeffmjack> in this case- $('.someClass').click(function() { $(this) }, what does $(this) refer to?  I tried to figure it out with an alert but the handler doesn't seem to work at all
[21:11:37] <Velveeta> jeffmjack: 'this' would refer to the element with 'someClass' class name that was just clicked on
[21:11:53] <Velveeta> if you have 3 of those elements, and the user clicks on the 2nd one, 'this' refers to that 2nd one
[21:12:00] <jeffmjack> hm ok, thanks :(
[21:12:03] <jeffmjack> that's what I thought
[21:12:08] <Velveeta> why is that a sad face?
[21:12:40] <jeffmjack> because it means the problem isn't obvious
[21:12:41] <jeffmjack> to me
[21:13:02] <Velveeta> what's the problem?
[21:13:16] <jeffmjack> hm I'll play with it and make a jsfiddle in a sec
[21:13:21] <Velveeta> ok
[21:19:29] <CoffeeMarker> I have this code
[21:19:40] <CoffeeMarker> var new_table = $('<div class="table_name item_div pointer" data-db_id="'+option_arr[j].substr(1)+'">242</div>');
[21:19:41] <CoffeeMarker> options.find('.is_table').append(new_table);
[21:19:43] <CoffeeMarker> new_table.remove();
[21:19:47] <CoffeeMarker> it works fine in jsfiddle
[21:19:57] <CoffeeMarker> but in my program the append works, but the remove doesnt
[21:20:05] <CoffeeMarker> any idea where the problem might be?
[21:21:02] <Velveeta> are you getting any errors, or is it just not doing what you expect?
[21:21:45] <CoffeeMarker> no errors, it's just not doing as expected
[21:22:42] <CoffeeMarker> it seems nothing works on the new_table variable
[21:22:51] <Velveeta> have you tried dropping in a breakpoint to see what it's trying to do?
[21:23:36] <CoffeeMarker> never heard of a breakpoint :x
[21:23:43] <eskatrem> CoffeeMarker: can you run that on the console of your browser once the page has loaded?
[21:24:52] <CoffeeMarker> I'll give it a try
[21:29:28] <CoffeeMarker> just ran it from my browser after its loaded, it behaves exactly the same
[21:29:34] <CoffeeMarker> so not as intended
[21:29:38] <CoffeeMarker> the remove() doesnt work
[21:30:45] <compact> Velveeta, not having any kuck
[21:30:46] <compact> luck
[21:30:49] <compact> anything else you can point me to
[21:31:07] <Uhkis> CoffeeMarker: if you check just that new_table on console, what's the output?
[21:32:37] <Velveeta> compact: here's your problem: http://jsfiddle.net/w29gxmj8/1/
[21:32:55] <Velveeta> once that handler is in place at the table level, you need to scope your math operation to the specific row in question
[21:33:19] <Velveeta> you can do that by finding the event target's closest <tr> and then using that to grab the cells in question to do your calculation and output your result
[21:33:44] <Velveeta> coffeemarker: what browser are you testing this in?
[21:33:54] <compact> ah row.find
[21:34:30] <Velveeta> yepyep, $() will grab all of those nodes in the document, row.find() will scope that search to just the current row
[21:35:41] <CoffeeMarker> the output seems to be exactly the div I would expect
[21:35:45] <CoffeeMarker> I'm using firefox
[21:37:26] <Velveeta> are you using firebug or the native javascript console to run your stuff?
[21:39:50] <CoffeeMarker> firebug
[21:40:07] <Velveeta> ok, there should be a script tab that you can use to look at the js file in question
[21:40:25] <Velveeta> to set a breakpoint, click in the left margin where the line numbers are, and you'll see a little dot appear
[21:41:07] <Velveeta> when execution hits that line, it'll pause in the debugger, and you can examine variables to see what their current values you, as well as run your own lines of code from the console, which will execute at that place in the code
[21:41:35] <Velveeta> so if you wanted to see what new_table.html() was, you could run it in the console while it was paused in that function, etc... use that to try to figure out what's going wrong in your code
[21:44:55] <CoffeeMarker> <div class="table_name item_div pointer" data-db_id="160">242</div>
[21:45:01] <CoffeeMarker> that is the value of the variable
[21:46:56] <compact> Velveeta, when i change "qty" i need it to do the same thing, is it better making 2 functions. one for "qty" and "freight-weight", and another one for "length", "width", "height". then do ao keyup, and just call the function
[21:49:05] <Velveeta> if a change to either 'qty' and 'freight-weight' is supposed to fire the same function, you can combine them into a single function... for length/width/height, you can do the same (in another function)
[21:50:00] <CoffeeMarker> doesnt seem I can remove it from the console, even after a breakpoint
[21:50:16] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/w29gxmj8/1/
[21:50:21] <compact> so expand the input.freight-weight?
[21:50:52] <Velveeta> right, use a comma and add the other selector for qty
[21:51:12] <Velveeta> that'll tell it to fire this callback function for any keyup event triggered on either freight-weight or qty
[21:52:12] <compact> awesome, got it
[21:52:13] <compact> thanks heaps
[21:52:27] <Velveeta> no problem
[21:53:08] <Velveeta> that could even be abstracted further (though i wouldn't recommend this, as you start losing readability) to encompass any change within a row and calculate properly, which i can throw together a quick demo just for educational purposes
[21:54:02] <compact> that would be cool
[21:54:04] <compact> thank you
[21:55:19] <CoffeeMarker> the new_table.html() outputs "242"
[21:55:28] <CoffeeMarker> is that maybe whats wrong?
[21:55:34] <CoffeeMarker> should it output the div object?
[21:56:55] <CoffeeMarker> doesnt seem so
[21:58:45] <Uhkis> does .text() also output that?
[21:59:51] <CoffeeMarker> yup
[22:00:07] <Velveeta> compact: here's an example for you: http://jsfiddle.net/w29gxmj8/2/
[22:00:55] <Velveeta> it uses some data properties on the elements themselves to assign groupings of inputs that should be multiplies together on keyup, and what their result output field is, then they can all be treated generically since they all have similar operations being performed (multiply all of one group together to get the value)
[22:00:59] <Uhkis> CoffeeMarker: how about .data('db_id')
[22:01:32] <Velveeta> you gain the ability to do all of that with a single event listener, and create new groupings whenever you want also, and have them all behave the same way without having to modify your code, just your markup
[22:01:59] <Velveeta> however, you lose readability, because anyone looking at the callback itself will have no idea what it's pertaining to, and would have to go investigate the markup at that point to figure out exactly what's going on
[22:02:18] <compact> wow thanks
[22:02:24] <compact> and what happens if i wanted a tally at the bottom
[22:02:28] <compact> like a 'summary'
[22:03:35] <Velveeta> you could have that automatically update here inside that callback also (or inside separate callbacks to increase readability) and update whenever any of those fields got a keyup event
[22:05:50] <CoffeeMarker> .data('db_id') gives 160
[22:08:39] <Uhkis> well that is just weird
[22:09:35] <CoffeeMarker> it seems if I change the html in the console, it actually works
[22:09:40] <CoffeeMarker> but I cant remove it
[22:09:54] <CoffeeMarker> or change the html in my code
[22:10:56] <Uhkis> hide() it?
[22:12:03] <Woet> hi Uhkis
[22:12:14] <Uhkis> well hello there Woet
[22:12:19] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[22:12:37] <CoffeeMarker> hide also works from the console, but not from my code
[22:13:48] <CoffeeMarker> actually got it to work from my code now
[22:14:25] <CoffeeMarker> I see, it suddenly makes sense now
[22:14:38] <Uhkis> CoffeeMarker: do tell?
[22:14:56] <CoffeeMarker> the remove doesnt work, because I was trying to remove it before appending it
[22:15:06] <Uhkis> lol
[22:15:17] <CoffeeMarker> although in the initial example I didnt do that
[22:15:32] <CoffeeMarker> ahh yeah
[22:15:36] <CoffeeMarker> and the second part is
[22:15:54] <CoffeeMarker> the variable new_table never seems to work after appending it anymore
[22:16:32] <CoffeeMarker> so it works as expected before appending
[22:17:15] <CoffeeMarker> I think normally I should be able to continue accessing the variable after appending no?
[22:18:08] <CoffeeMarker> var new_table = $('<div class="table_name item_div pointer" data-db_id="'+option_arr[j].substr(1)+'">242</div>');
[22:18:10] <CoffeeMarker> new_table.html('1');
[22:18:11] <CoffeeMarker> options.find('.is_table').append(new_table);
[22:18:13] <CoffeeMarker> new_table.html('2');
[22:18:14] <CoffeeMarker> this sets the html to 1
[22:18:16] <CoffeeMarker> not 2
[22:45:03] <CoffeeMarker> I see where the problem lies
[22:45:24] <CoffeeMarker> after the append, the variable only references to the last element created
[23:37:41] <john-dev> anybody know a multiselect plugin, where the user can add a custom value to each selected field?
[23:39:07] <Cork> ad a value to each selected field?
[23:40:02] <john-dev> yees, like i select the field „Money“ and the user can add a numeric value to it,  but in a multiselect
[23:40:51] <john-dev> i could do this using jquery - but i would prefer a plugin
[23:41:32] <Cork> john-dev: i don't think you will find one
[23:41:58] <Cork> normally that is done by combining a dropdown with a textarea
[23:42:38] <john-dev> ok, thank you :)
[23:43:02] <Cork> opps input field not textarea :)
[23:43:46] <john-dev> i’ll try to use text rows text() ;-)
