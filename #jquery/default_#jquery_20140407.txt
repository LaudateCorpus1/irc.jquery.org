[00:17:40] <no_gravity> I was thinking an element $(e) has all the properties of e. But x=$(e);x.style.left="123px"; doesnt work. Where am i thinking wrong?
[00:21:44] <Cork> no_gravity: $(e) is a jquery wrapped e
[00:21:53] <Cork> no_gravity: it has NONE of the properties from e
[00:22:08] <Cork> you can access them through other functions though
[00:22:13] <Cork> like .css('left')
[00:22:31] <Cork> and .prop('') for generic properties like disabled, checked and the like
[00:22:33] <no_gravity> Cork: strangely, that gives me a different position on screen then e.style.left="123px"
[00:22:59] <Cork> no_gravity: well ya
[00:23:08] <Cork> e.style.left will give you what is added inline on the element
[00:23:22] <Cork> $(e).css('left') will give you the computed left value
[00:23:50] <Cork> (meaning it will include values from the stylesheet)
[00:23:52] <no_gravity> Cork: i mean setting it
[00:24:10] <Cork> $(e).css('left', '123px') should give the same effect
[00:24:25] <no_gravity> Cork: strangely not
[00:24:33] <Cork> you have a demo?
[00:24:54] <no_gravity> Cork: the real world thing is huge. let me try for a sec.
[00:25:14] <Cork> no_gravity: try reproduce the situation from scratch
[00:25:24] <Cork> with just a minimal amount of code/css/html
[00:25:31] <no_gravity> Cork: sure
[00:26:11] <no_gravity> Cork: maybe i was wrong
[00:26:33] <no_gravity> Cork: looks good now :)
[00:26:53] <Cork> no_gravity: reproducing in a clean environment is always a good first step :)
[00:27:00] <Cork> i do it all the time
[00:27:14] <no_gravity> Cork: me too
[00:29:14] <no_gravity> Cork: thanks for your help!
[00:29:24] <Cork> yw
[00:35:19] <terabit> how would I go about adding rows and cells to an empty <table id="abc"></table> in jquery?
[00:35:49] <Cork> $('#abc tbody').append('<tr><td></td></tr>')
[00:38:08] <terabit> yeah, I was doing this http://pastebin.com/UKedj3Qc but not working
[00:39:09] <xec> terabit: it's probably better to concatenate the html first, and do the append once. also note the "tbody" in Cork's code
[00:39:50] <Cork> terabit: the browser auto creates the tbody if you don't have it in your html
[00:41:16] <terabit> I see ,let me try that then
[00:53:38] <terabit> weird http://pastebin.com/nrbUqPxy
[00:54:14] <terabit> the alert shows all the right <tr> and <td> but table does not appear, you think I need to somehow make it visible ?
[00:54:56] <Cork> terabit: use a live site like jsbin or jsfiddle
[00:55:45] <terabit> ahh,didn't know they existed ,let me do that
[00:56:16] <xec> also, to concatenate a string you can just do: intbl += "some string"
[00:56:40] <Abbbbbbhi> Hi
[00:56:40] <Cork> terabit: though your ajax calls are local so it won't work
[00:56:51] <wa5ted> hey
[00:56:52] <terabit> yeah,that's what I was thinking too Cork
[00:56:54] <wa5ted> Cork:
[00:56:58] <wa5ted> quick question
[00:57:19] <Cork> terabit: also for memory optimization do var arr = []; arr.push() arr.join('') instead or concat or +=
[00:57:23] <terabit> but I am doing the append right ?
[00:57:24] <wa5ted> if i have no styling added to the body ad i want to make a child div fill the entire body how would i do that
[00:57:31] <Cork> ya
[00:57:32] <wa5ted> *and
[00:57:51] <terabit> ok
[00:58:02] <Cork> wa5ted: if you by fill mean height
[00:58:11] <Cork> you would have to use position: absolute;
[00:58:25] <Cork> body and html need to be height: 100% if you want to do it without
[00:58:26] <wa5ted> Cork: height and naturally the width too
[00:58:32] <wa5ted> okay
[00:58:37] <wa5ted> that the bit  iwas missign
[00:58:39] <wa5ted> missing
[00:58:52] <Abbbbbbhi> I wwant to set content in iframe body but after iframe loads (Usingpure JS) . So basically I want to run code after iframe loads - so me using this._frame.onload = function(){
[00:58:53] <Abbbbbbhi> 					alert("hello");
[00:58:55] <Abbbbbbhi> 			} (_frame is the id) so this alert would tigger only after iframe loads ?
[00:59:15] <wa5ted> Abbbbbbhi: paste code in a jsfiddle
[00:59:21] <wa5ted> dont paste it here
[00:59:21] <Abbbbbbhi> Sorry
[00:59:26] <wa5ted> jsfiddle.net
[00:59:30] <wa5ted> paste in there link us
[00:59:32] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: also you can't do it if the iframe is crossdomain
[00:59:33] <wa5ted> ask question
[01:00:14] <Abbbbbbhi> Iframe is not crossdomain = http://jsfiddle.net/DvLw9/
[01:00:42] <Abbbbbbhi> Is this correct way to implement? Onload run the code ?
[01:01:24] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: it looks like onload should already be fired as your using _frame.contentDocument.body
[01:01:30] <Cork> and it won't exist before onload fires
[01:02:08] <Cork> (technically there is one event before onload where it is created, but anyway)
[01:02:44] <Abbbbbbhi> Ok  , the reason I am using onload is - i am changing the displayof iframe from none to block. Which causes the content to disappear in firefox . In chrome its working fine
[01:03:06] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: disappear?
[01:03:11] <Cork> that sounds like a bug...
[01:03:28] <Cork> (a rendering bug)
[01:03:54] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: if possible try reproduce the effect with jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[01:05:06] <bristleback> Hi all
[01:08:20] <terabit> Cork: lol, I removed tbody and it worked lol
[01:08:23] <bristleback> I have the following problem: I have a series of requests that have to be made async using AJAX. before the first request is made, a modal window should open (the modal it's made with jquery-ui). My problem is that unless I do the the AJAX req sync, the modal will not open untill all the request are finished
[01:08:26] <bristleback> any idea why?
[01:08:34] <Cork> terabit: O_o'
[01:09:40] <CrowX-> how do I play/pause a html5 video from jquery? $('#videoPlayer').what?
[01:10:50] <Cork> $('#videoPlayer')[0].play()
[01:13:05] <wa5ted> Cork: new problem, say i have a background image and a bnch of children divs that are "markers" on a stat image map ,how would i place the markers such that even if i resize screen they stay in the same place
[01:13:47] <wa5ted> *stat = static
[01:14:05] <Cork> wa5ted: tricky
[01:14:28] <wa5ted> Cork: thats why i asked
[01:14:36] <Cork> you would have to set the image to be 1:1 (meaning no background-size)
[01:14:52] <Cork> cause else you will have a fun time calculating where it should be
[01:15:10] <wa5ted> well thats the problem
[01:15:12] <Cork> left: <some percent>; might work though
[01:15:18] <wa5ted> the image im using is about 5000*5000
[01:15:27] <wa5ted> i tried percent dont working
[01:15:38] <wa5ted> let me see if i can upload the code
[01:18:06] <CrowX-> Cork, what about replay?
[01:18:46] <wa5ted> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/54zZz/1/
[01:19:32] <Cork> CrowX-: .prop('currentTime', 0)[0].play();
[01:19:42] <wa5ted> when i resize that will be the problem
[01:20:11] <CrowX-> thanks
[01:20:53] <Cork> wa5ted: you need to take the 50% positioning into account
[01:21:08] <wa5ted> so that would require js calculation
[01:21:11] <Cork> wa5ted: best is prob to change that to 0% 0%
[01:21:23] <wa5ted> but i need that part of the map
[01:21:26] <CrowX-> Cork,  ..has no method prop"
[01:21:33] <wa5ted> i would love to do 0% 0%
[01:22:01] <Cork> wa5ted: wa5ted you could use calc() i guess
[01:22:07] <Cork> wa5ted: most modern browsers support it now
[01:22:11] <wa5ted> true
[01:22:21] <Cork> wa5ted: or you could move it all into svg and just have it work :)
[01:22:22] <wa5ted> do you think you can show me example in action
[01:22:37] <wa5ted> Cork: well that would be great
[01:23:00] <wa5ted> i just wanna getit done so
[01:23:11] <wa5ted> if you can show me an example of whatyour thinking that might help
[01:23:15] <wa5ted> *get it
[01:23:16] <Cork> wa5ted: something like calc((5000 / 50%) + <percent>%) might work
[01:23:22] <Cork> haven't played with calc too much yet
[01:23:28] <Cork> only very basic math
[01:23:33] <wa5ted> so calc is a js function?
[01:23:42] <Cork> ?mdn calc
[01:23:44] <b-ot> Cork: calc - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc
[01:23:47] <wa5ted> so can you explai nthat formula a bit
[01:24:11] <Cork> wa5ted: 50% on 5000px is the center of the image
[01:24:28] <Cork> hmm ya, that formula wouldn't be enough
[01:24:43] <Cork> wa5ted: you need to find where 0x0 is on the map
[01:24:50] <Cork> to get an offset to use for your markers
[01:25:06] <wa5ted> relative to the current center
[01:25:10] <wa5ted> at 50% 50%
[01:25:16] <Cork> of the viewport ya
[01:25:27] <CrowX-> Cork, any idea? Object #<HTMLVideoElement> has no method 'prop'
[01:25:28] <Cork> so my formula isn't even close to enough
[01:25:45] <Cork> wa5ted: on second though you most likely can't get away from svg or js
[01:26:08] <Cork> CrowX-: your running on the dom element and not jquery if you get that
[01:26:19] <Cork> so just use the property directly (not through .prop())
[01:26:36] <CrowX-> Cork, I'm running $("#player")[0].prop('currentTime', 0)[0].play();
[01:26:45] <CrowX-> same thing I did for play/pause, and that one worked
[01:26:47] <Cork> CrowX-: remove the first [0]
[01:27:02] <terabit> Cork: if it's not a bother, how might I empty out that table I mentioned earlier before appending to it ?
[01:27:25] <CrowX-> worked :)
[01:27:46] <Cork> terabit: .empty()
[01:27:57] <terabit> ahh, thanks a bunch lol
[01:28:03] <Cork> terabit: though i would add the tbody element so you know what happens when you work with it
[01:28:23] <Cork> i get itchy when i see a table without tbody :)
[01:28:38] <villor> I can't get .resizable() to work, it just says Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'resizable'  http://jsfiddle.net/5Tp5V/ what am I doing wrong?
[01:28:59] <Cork> villor: you need jquery-ui
[01:29:36] <villor> Cork: can't believe I missed that... thanks alot!
[01:31:29] <terabit> Cork: ok, I did :)
[01:42:22] <wa5ted> Cork: see i could just use an image of the markers and photoshop them in
[01:42:27] <wa5ted> but i have a mouse animation as well
[01:42:38] <Cork> wa5ted: i would go with svg
[01:42:42] <wa5ted> that i will be running so i need to know where the mouse should "click"
[01:42:52] <wa5ted> okay can you pont me to some resoruces
[01:42:56] <wa5ted> confused about the svg method
[01:42:58] <Cork> uh
[01:43:10] <Cork> wa5ted: you embed the image in an svg file and create the markers in the svg
[01:43:18] <Cork> then you have it all in one file and it should just work
[01:43:26] <Cork> or you could embed the svg in html
[01:43:29] <Cork> and use js on it
[01:43:32] <Cork> several options
[01:43:47] <wa5ted> true
[01:43:47] <Cork> wa5ted: it is fairly basic svg so just look up svg tags
[01:43:53] <Cork> ?mdn svg
[01:43:55] <b-ot> Cork: SVG | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG
[01:43:56] <wa5ted> okay
[01:45:57] <wa5ted> Cork: is there a way to make positioning relative to the center of a parent?
[01:46:05] <Cork> no
[01:46:18] <Cork> well you can in svg
[01:46:23] <wa5ted> okay
[01:50:17] <xec> well
[01:50:30] <xec> you can in css too with a bit of trickery
[01:51:36] <DansVC> Hi everybody
[01:55:03] <xec> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/x3dH4/
[01:55:49] <wa5ted> xec: so part 2 of my question is there any way to make it relative to a background image
[01:55:55] <wa5ted> or an img in  an img tag
[01:56:10] <wa5ted> that overflows and is set at position 50% 50%
[01:56:13] <xec> well not without more trickery ;)
[01:56:51] <xec> make a fiddle with what you have, an i'll see if it can be done (or rather, if I can do it)
[01:57:19] <wa5ted> well the fiddle is there
[01:57:38] <wa5ted> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/54zZz/2/
[01:57:50] <wa5ted> its a bit tricky like you said
[02:02:21] <Flikovski> ar_Beaver
[02:02:41] <xec> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/54zZz/3/ ?
[02:02:51] <xec> i dont know where you wanted the marker though
[02:03:04] <wa5ted> as long as it stays in one place
[02:03:13] <wa5ted> damn bro
[02:03:17] <wa5ted> explain
[02:03:26] <Nuclear_Beaver> hey, a jquery thing is going to drive me crazy
[02:03:27] <xec> it's the same method i used in the first demo
[02:03:30] <Nuclear_Beaver> on this file : http://pastebin.com/2t1NLrvM
[02:03:44] <Nuclear_Beaver> the first function, retrieveMap works perfectly
[02:03:56] <xec> wa5ted: first place it in the middle, left: 50%; right: 50%; and then use margins to position it relative to that
[02:04:13] <wa5ted> okay
[02:04:14] <wa5ted> cool
[02:04:15] <xec> err left / *top*
[02:04:21] <Nuclear_Beaver> but the second one is giving me a problem : when it's thrown, everything stops working
[02:04:32] <wa5ted> xec:  thanks
[02:04:34] <wa5ted> bro
[02:04:39] <wa5ted> see this is why i love #jquery
[02:04:44] <wa5ted> you guys are mavericks
[02:05:01] <Nuclear_Beaver> if you could help me, i would be very pleased, as the two functions look exaclty the same to me and so I can't know where the problem is
[02:05:08] <xec> an os from apple? or a basketball team?
[02:06:51] <Nuclear_Beaver> so, do you have an idea about what could be my error ?
[02:07:18] <wa5ted> xec: when i resize the screen is there anyway to have a certain area in focus, because say the background positioning is at 75% 75% then it doesnt have a common about which the window resizes
[02:07:42] <xec> i'm not sure what you mean by that
[02:08:06] <wa5ted> xec: if you change the background positioning
[02:08:08] <wa5ted> to say
[02:08:12] <wa5ted> 75% 75%
[02:08:44] <wa5ted> then there is no common point about which the window resizes
[02:08:47] <wa5ted> with 50% 50%
[02:08:56] <wa5ted> it resizes about a certain point
[02:08:59] <xec> wa5ted: of course....
[02:09:08] <xec> wa5ted: 75% is not 50% ...
[02:09:14] <wa5ted> yes
[02:09:17] <wa5ted> my question is
[02:09:19] <xec> so do 75%
[02:09:21] <xec> ....
[02:09:24] <wa5ted> if i wanna show a differnt part of the map
[02:09:38] <wa5ted> using background positioning
[02:09:45] <wa5ted> will i still get that common point
[02:09:49] <wa5ted> "common point"
[02:10:26] <xec> if you change the position of the map dynamically like that, i suggest you dont center it
[02:10:49] <wa5ted> okay
[02:10:51] <wa5ted> nvm
[02:10:52] <wa5ted> i got my answer
[02:10:56] <xec> if you want to relatively position something to a background that is positioned at 75% 75%, do top: 75%; left: 75%;
[02:10:57] <wa5ted> thanks for your help :)
[02:11:07] <wa5ted> okay thanks
[02:15:20] <Nuclear_Beaver> Still have the problem about http://pastebin.com/2t1NLrvM . The second functions stops everything when it's called and i don't know why, as it looks like the first. (and no error in the the console)
[02:16:14] <under_09> good bye
[02:16:17] <under_09> -ㄷ-/
[02:16:38] <seutje> Nuclear_Beaver: the second seems to be an event handler
[02:16:54] <seutje> might it be erroring out on event.data being undefined?
[02:17:18] <Nuclear_Beaver> nope
[02:17:19] <Nuclear_Beaver> defined
[02:17:27] <Nuclear_Beaver> i got event.data.x , .y and .map for my tests
[02:17:32] <seutje> also, the script you are calling is called "send", are you sure you shouldn't be posting to it?
[02:17:34] <Nuclear_Beaver> I made the code lighter so you can see that
[02:18:18] <Nuclear_Beaver> I don't know much when to use a post and a get, so I use get because I can use the URL to send the request manually when i need to
[02:18:28] <Nuclear_Beaver> $('#sub').bind( "click", {x: abs, y: ord, map: tab_map}, function(event) {envoyerMap(event);});
[02:18:38] <Nuclear_Beaver> here is where "envoyerMap" is called
[02:18:52] <seutje> why do u wrap it in function() {}?
[02:18:54] <Nuclear_Beaver> It does work with an alert instead of the $.get, i can alert(even.data.x) etc.
[02:19:03] <Nuclear_Beaver> seutje : little fail ha ha
[02:19:07] <seutje> don't use alert, it halts execution
[02:19:23] <Nuclear_Beaver> I used the alert in order to see until which point it works well
[02:19:35] <Nuclear_Beaver> and it works until the $.get i showed you on pastebin
[02:20:07] <seutje> I don't see anything wrong it it, assuming $ is defined in that scope and all
[02:20:46] <seutje> if you want to halt execution intentionally, consider using a debugger statement or a breakpoint
[02:21:03] <Nuclear_Beaver> ok, so, the error is somewhere else
[02:21:08] <Nuclear_Beaver> i'm gonna check that
[02:21:23] <Nuclear_Beaver> and the thing about the debugger statement / breakpoint too
[02:21:25] <Nuclear_Beaver> Thanks !
[02:22:39] <Nuclear_Beaver> oh, and seutje, i have a last question
[02:23:33] <Nuclear_Beaver> if I don't wrapp it up in an anonymous function, what should i write ? "$('#sub').bind( "click", {x: abs, y: ord, map: tab_map}, envoyerMap(event));" doesn't work (instead of binding to the click, it calls the function once, at the beginning)
[02:25:05] <seutje> Nuclear_Beaver: drop the (event)
[02:25:31] <seutje> you are passing it a function, putting brackets on it executes the function and passes the return value instead of the function itself
[02:25:47] <Nuclear_Beaver> i understood that
[02:25:55] <Nuclear_Beaver> that's why i wrapped it up in an anonmyous one
[02:26:00] <seutje> (also, "event" is undefined in that scope, as it is the argument passed to the function you passed as a handler)
[02:26:35] <Nuclear_Beaver> (yep, but i didnt know that if i just wrote "envoyerMap", the event would be sent like that ha ha)
[02:26:40] <seutje> just leaving the () off makes it a reference to the function
[02:27:23] <Nuclear_Beaver> and, there is still the problem.
[02:28:05] <Nuclear_Beaver> i don't understand, when i print event.data.x and event.data.y, they are here. send_map is where it should be. #test4 does exist. and you told me there wasnt a problem in the code x_x
[02:28:26] <seutje> yeah, I know, but I can't see any obvious problem with this bit, try reproducing it in a fiddle or something
[02:28:37] <seutje> can you verify the ajax request is never made?
[02:28:49] <Nuclear_Beaver> how can i ?
[02:29:02] <seutje> devtools
[02:29:14] <seutje> chrome logs XHR requests in the console iirc, and in the network tab
[02:29:33] <Nuclear_Beaver> yep, but when it buggs, i cant use that
[02:30:00] <seutje> sry?
[02:30:09] <Nuclear_Beaver> when the function is called
[02:30:12] <Nuclear_Beaver> it fucks everything
[02:30:15] <Nuclear_Beaver> including chrome
[02:30:18] <seutje> u can have the console persist over pageloads
[02:30:39] <seutje> oh, ok... well, then there isn't much for me to work with, is there?
[02:30:51] <Nuclear_Beaver> ha ha
[02:30:57] <Nuclear_Beaver> if i open the console before
[02:31:05] <Nuclear_Beaver> when i call the function, it doesnt refresh
[02:31:18] <Nuclear_Beaver> and if i try to open the console after i call the function
[02:31:19] <Nuclear_Beaver> i cant
[02:31:20] <Nuclear_Beaver> it doesnt
[02:31:48] <seutje> "it doesnt refresh" = the console doesn't show any new output?
[02:31:53] <Nuclear_Beaver> yep
[02:32:07] <Nuclear_Beaver> no events, nothing
[02:32:16] <Nuclear_Beaver> i can navigate in, but it's like it has been frozen
[02:32:22] <seutje> so no callstack error, no "unresponsive script" warning, nothing?
[02:32:28] <seutje> just "freeze"
[02:32:35] <seutje> ?
[02:32:41] <Nuclear_Beaver> nothing
[02:32:47] <Nuclear_Beaver> just "freeze" :')
[02:32:52] <seutje> grats, u broke the VM
[02:32:57] <Nuclear_Beaver> VM ?
[02:33:03] <seutje> virtual machine
[02:33:10] <seutje> thing that parses your javamascripts
[02:33:14] <Nuclear_Beaver> oh i see
[02:33:16] <Nuclear_Beaver> ha ha
[02:34:13] <seutje> not sure how much I can do to help though
[02:35:00] <seutje> you may have uncovered a rather nasty bug in the parser, what happens on the firefoxes?
[02:35:07] <CrowX-> why doesn't the following line create an image on my site: $('#content').append('<img src="images/someimage.png"/>');
[02:35:20] <Nuclear_Beaver> i'm going to see that
[02:35:41] <CrowX-> inspect elements doesn't show an image tag anywhere inside #content
[02:35:48] <Nuclear_Beaver> (well, i don't have firefox on this computer, so i'm downloading it)
[02:36:23] <seutje> CrowX-: #content most likely did not exist when that line was executed
[02:36:24] <Nuclear_Beaver> (i try it on ie to see what happens there)
[02:36:36] <CrowX-> thanks
[02:37:32] <seutje> CrowX-: put "console.log($('#content').length);" on the line above, if it print "0" in the console, the element did not exist you and you have to either move you code to the bottom of the body, wrap it in a doc.rdy or put it in the handler of whatever ajax mojo you're doing
[02:37:41] <Nuclear_Beaver> (wel, on ie, canva doesnt even load)
[02:37:44] <seutje> did not exist yet*
[02:38:19] <Nuclear_Beaver> Firefox fucked my canva :)
[02:38:28] <Nuclear_Beaver> And I don't even know why
[02:39:08] <CrowX-> seutje, you were right, #content wasn't loaded yet, so I added the other code within the load event, and it worked
[02:39:17] <Nuclear_Beaver> error in jquery.js with firefox ._.
[02:39:41] <seutje> CrowX-: load, like window.load? that's kinda late, doc.rdy should be fine
[02:39:46] <Cork> Nuclear_Beaver: if you replace the data variable with a static string does it still hang?
[02:40:02] <Nuclear_Beaver> Cork : You mean, in the get ?
[02:40:06] <Cork> yes
[02:40:27] <Cork> basically is it hanging on the xhr parsing or the html() call
[02:40:58] <seutje> that's why I was trying to figure out if the XHR is firing at all
[02:41:03] <Nuclear_Beaver> 		$('#sub').bind( "click", {x: "abs", y: "ord", map: "1"}, envoyerMap);
[02:41:11] <Nuclear_Beaver> with that, it works
[02:41:12] <Nuclear_Beaver> yay
[02:41:27] <Cork> what does that have to do with the $.get call?
[02:41:37] <Nuclear_Beaver> but
[02:41:44] <Nuclear_Beaver> it's non-sense
[02:41:55] <seutje> the get happens in envoyerMap, which is a click handler
[02:42:07] <Cork> and what was the click handler?
[02:42:17] <seutje> $('#sub').bind( "click", {x: abs, y: ord, map: tab_map}, function(event) {envoyerMap(event);});
[02:42:26] <seutje> so those references are fucked somehow
[02:42:38] <Nuclear_Beaver> it's totally non-sense, as in "envoyerMap", when i've written alert(event.data.x), it has shown me the what was in abs
[02:42:52] <Nuclear_Beaver> the same goes for ord and map
[02:42:55] <CrowX-> seutje, no, #content's load. it was an ajax call :)
[02:43:04] <Cork> Nuclear_Beaver: sounds like it might be a context collapse bug
[02:43:13] <seutje> CrowX-: oh, the dubious convenience methods, always forget about them
[02:43:32] <Nuclear_Beaver> Cork : English is not my first language, so when you write "context collapse bug", i imagine some epic matrix shit
[02:43:33] <Cork> Nuclear_Beaver: browsers try to collapse functions like that to speed things up
[02:43:44] <Nuclear_Beaver> oh, i see
[02:43:47] <Cork> so they factor out the function
[02:43:58] <Cork> and sometimes the code loses variables when that happens
[02:44:16] <Nuclear_Beaver> so, what should i do if i want to send abs and ord ?
[02:44:20] <Cork> Nuclear_Beaver: so it might be the gc kills the variable for you
[02:44:42] <Cork> envoyerMap(event.data); ?
[02:44:50] <Nuclear_Beaver> wait
[02:45:01] <Nuclear_Beaver> something is wrong
[02:45:07] <Nuclear_Beaver> ha ha
[02:45:29] <Nuclear_Beaver> when i do alert(event.data.x); in envoyerMap
[02:45:34] <Cork> also all the errors you get in other browsers indicates you have other problems in the code
[02:45:35] <Nuclear_Beaver> it shows me the right thing
[02:45:40] <Nuclear_Beaver> what was in "abs"
[02:45:45] <Cork> Nuclear_Beaver: yes, cause you reference the variable
[02:45:48] <Cork> so you keep it alive
[02:46:07] <Cork> Nuclear_Beaver: when you get premature gc free it isn't just to check if the value exist
[02:46:34] <Nuclear_Beaver> so, now, the problem is, the variables doesn't interfere with the get
[02:46:48] <Nuclear_Beaver> wait, in the get, i'll make something without event.data.x and .y
[02:47:17] <Nuclear_Beaver> ok, it works
[02:47:21] <seutje> weird, would cloning the data object make any difference, you reckon?
[02:47:43] <Cork> or just var d = event.data;
[02:47:56] <Cork> if it is gc related that should tell the engine what happens
[02:48:36] <Nuclear_Beaver> and with var d = event.data
[02:48:40] <Nuclear_Beaver> there is the problem
[02:48:48] <Nuclear_Beaver> so it's not about keeping the thing alive
[02:48:53] <Nuclear_Beaver> shat
[02:49:32] <Cork> Nuclear_Beaver: have you checked in the browser network tab what data you send?
[02:49:40] <Cork> (btw do you have a live link?)
[02:49:53] <Nuclear_Beaver> when there is the problem, the network tab freezes
[02:50:05] <Nuclear_Beaver> (nope, but it's like 100ko, so i can zip it and send you if you want)
[02:50:11] <Cork> put a breakpoint before the .get call
[02:50:18] <Cork> or at the get call rather
[02:50:35] <Nuclear_Beaver> until the get call, everything is fine
[02:50:44] <Cork> trace from there
[02:51:03] <seutje> keep on steppin'

[02:51:56] <Nuclear_Beaver> http://www.megafileupload.com/en/file/516283/Test-Jeu-rar.html
[02:52:26] <Nuclear_Beaver> the html to open is "map_edit.html"
[02:52:29] <Nuclear_Beaver> the first one
[02:53:17] <seutje> gotta love that outlive on the transparent gifs
[02:53:46] <Nuclear_Beaver> i've found the problem
[02:53:55] <Nuclear_Beaver> and i hate myself
[02:54:24] <Nuclear_Beaver> var obs = $('#ord').val() ;
[02:54:27] <Nuclear_Beaver> instead of var ord = $('#ord').val() ;
[02:54:35] <Nuclear_Beaver> and when i made the tests, i used "obs" as well
[02:54:44] <Nuclear_Beaver> so the mistake didnt show up
[02:55:51] <Nuclear_Beaver> |\_/| I hate Myself |\_/|
[02:56:58] <seutje> so wait, the parser *froze* over an underfined?
[02:57:10] <Nuclear_Beaver> looks like that
[02:57:15] <seutje> that doesn't seem right o.O
[02:57:17] <Nuclear_Beaver> an undefined in a get
[02:57:19] <Cork> no
[02:57:25] <Nuclear_Beaver> maybe that's the problem
[02:57:42] <Nuclear_Beaver> oh, it wasnt an undefined
[02:57:55] <Nuclear_Beaver> i tell you what it was
[02:58:19] <Nuclear_Beaver> "objectHTMLInputElement"
[02:58:41] <Nuclear_Beaver> (i cant understand that)
[02:58:44] <Nuclear_Beaver> (as it was undefined)
[02:58:54] <Nuclear_Beaver> (but i guess shit happens)
[03:00:15] <Nuclear_Beaver> I have a last question, how can i convert a two dimmensional array into a string with javascript ? so I can decode it with php
[03:00:26] <Cork> works here http://jsfiddle.net/LNDsV/1/
[03:00:28] <Nuclear_Beaver> Cause i don't find interesting things online, maybe i'll make my own function
[03:00:59] <Cork> (meaning js throws an error and no hang)
[03:01:10] <Nuclear_Beaver> (good)
[03:01:37] <Nuclear_Beaver> (i think my computer, or chrome love messing with me)
[03:01:47] <Nuclear_Beaver> (or both of them, maybe it's a conspiracy)
[03:39:43] <Elirips> Hello. If I remove an element, using $("#id").remove(); do I also need to remove any click handlers set? Imagine at some time later, the element gets added again and install click-handlers again, if I do not 'off' the click-handlers before removing the element, will then two handlers be installed?
[03:39:59] <Elirips> Or is there some "magic" that goes as: If an element gets removed, also all its handlers get removed?
[03:40:44] <xec> `api remove @ Elirips
[03:40:44] <b-ot> Elirips: .remove(): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[03:40:49] <xec> "all bound events and jQuery data associated with the elements are removed. To remove the elements without removing data and events, use .detach() instead."
[03:41:22] <Elirips> xec: uh, thank you. I only read the first sentence.. sorry for the noise
[03:41:47] <xec> no worries ;) it was kind of quiet in here
[03:46:47] <hxm> why bootstrap doesnt have a channel?
[03:50:29] <Cork> hxm: there is one

[03:51:10] <hxm> i am using bootstrap but not for twitter
[03:51:17] <hxm> is bootstrap focused on twitter apps?
[03:51:18] <Cork> bootstrap is a twitter lib
[03:51:39] <beancurd> as in the dudes who created it worked for twitter.

[03:52:12] <Cork> bah
[03:52:39] <t432> I need to test an ajax method, instead of calling the server every time I run the function can I have it set up to get the data from local file?
[03:52:43] <Cork> http://jacobrask.github.io/styledocco/styledocco/examples/bootstrap/docs/
[03:53:02] <Cork> t432: no
[03:53:28] <Cork> t432: you can fake the ajax call and use a local variable if your working with json
[03:53:32] <Cork> to kinda fake it
[03:53:33] <t432> thought not.
[03:53:52] <t432> that will do,
[03:53:52] <Cork> but $.ajax and friends can't access local files
[03:54:31] <Cork> t432: setTimeout(function() { handler(stored_data); }, 1000); is a decent way to emulate it
[03:54:54] <Cork> where handler is the function you'll use with ajax
[03:55:29] <simonj89> trying to link a MVC action in MVC, using:
[03:55:29] <simonj89> <li><a href="@Url.Action("Details", new { item.ID })"></li>
[03:55:34] <simonj89> I have to click the link twice
[03:55:50] <simonj89> and the url doesnt change
[03:57:04] <wa5ted> xec: still around
[03:57:50] <wa5ted> any way i can make an image when the window resizes have a certain part of the image  at the center of the window
[03:58:53] <t432> Cork: are you are of any infinite scroll scripts?
[03:59:02] <t432> or a decent tutorial
[03:59:04] <t432> ?
[03:59:11] <Cork> are you are?
[03:59:12] <Cork> :)
[03:59:20] <t432> oops
[03:59:24] <Cork> t432: i've written a few my selfs
[03:59:28] <t432> are you aware*
[03:59:31] <Cork> t432: it is quite simple
[03:59:40] <Cork> just check scrollHeight - scrollTop
[04:00:07] <Cork> and if value gets below a threshold value
[04:00:14] <Cork> you fetch a new value and append to the page
[04:03:45] <xec> wa5ted: not easily (that i know of)
[04:03:55] <wa5ted> hmmmmmm
[04:04:09] <wa5ted> xec: perhaps we need the Wisdom of the great Cork
[04:04:59] <Cork> wa5ted: depends on what you want to do
[04:05:14] <wa5ted> Cork: any way i can make an image when the window resizes have a certain part of the image at the center of the window
[04:05:16] <Cork> css can do simpler forms of it
[04:05:50] <Cork> background-position: calc(50% - 40px) calc(50% - 10px);
[04:06:00] <Cork> if that is enough for you, it is possible
[04:06:03] <wa5ted> calc is css?
[04:06:04] <wa5ted> calc()
[04:06:06] <xec> yes
[04:06:10] <wa5ted> damn bro
[04:06:10] <Cork> ?mdn css calc
[04:06:10] <b-ot> Cork: calc - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc
[04:06:21] <Cork> wa5ted: note it needs a new version of ie
[04:06:24] <wa5ted> think css4 will ever become reality
[04:06:28] <Cork> but the others has supported it for along time
[04:06:39] <Cork> wa5ted: they are still implementing things in css3
[04:06:43] <Cork> so let it land first :)
[04:06:44] <wa5ted> true
[04:07:01] <xec> wa5ted: there will never be a css4, only modules (iirc)
[04:07:06] <wa5ted> true
[04:07:15] <Cork> xec: i think they are plaining for css4 actually
[04:07:16] <wa5ted> it doesnt hurt to dream though ;)
[04:07:17] <xec> wa5ted: there will be a *selectors* level 4 etc
[04:07:22] <Cork> there are early specs for it at least
[04:07:28] <wa5ted> nice
[04:07:35] <wa5ted> now we can do stuff like
[04:07:38] <wa5ted> ul <li
[04:07:43] <wa5ted> ul < li
[04:07:59] <wa5ted> anyways
[04:08:02] <Cork> wa5ted: that most likely won't ever happen
[04:08:02] <wa5ted> ill look into the calc
[04:08:04] <wa5ted> stuff
[04:08:06] <xec> Cork: selectors level 4 is *not* css4
[04:08:13] <wa5ted> damn it
[04:08:16] <wa5ted> :p
[04:08:38] <Cork> xec: ex. http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css4-ui
[04:08:48] <Cork> and http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css4-color
[04:09:08] <Cork> but like i said it is still in early stages
[04:09:41] <Cork> but yes, they are planing to implement it the same way they moved css3 to
[04:09:43] <Cork> wth modules
[04:10:00] <xec> right, i see what you mean
[04:10:15] <Cork> xec: css didn't move to a living standard like html did
[04:10:20] <Cork> so they will still have set versions
[04:12:15] <Cork> what i long the most for is the :matches() in css4
[04:12:22] <xec> what i mean is, there will not be a monolithic spec called css4, like there was with css2.1
[04:12:29] <Cork> browsers has is as :-prefix-any() now
[04:12:35] <Cork> it will make css soooooooo much nicer
[04:12:56] <Cork> xec: well i think it will, it will just land in parts
[04:13:03] <Cork> when all parts has landed you get the spec
[04:14:58] <Cork> *has it as
[04:15:00] <xec> Cork: maybe i'm off base here, but there is no css3 spec either is there
[04:15:08] <xec> Cork: there are snapshots
[04:15:38] <Cork> xec: ya, cause modules are still not frozen yet
[04:16:00] <Cork> but as far as i know they arn't adding new parts to the wg either
[04:16:05] <Cork> those are meant for css4
[04:16:30] <xec> so in essence, you mean they are not done with css3 yet and when it is, there will be a single big spec called css3?
[04:16:33] <Cork> meaning there is a fixed scope, and when they have dropped or added all the modules you should have the spec
[04:16:55] <Cork> xec: well either that or a page listing all the css3 modules
[04:17:07] <Cork> depending on how they choose to publish it
[04:19:43] <xec> in conclusion, it's all very confusing ;)
[04:20:17] <Cork> well the change was to get out of the problem of things never landing
[04:20:52] <Cork> and honestly noone should care what spec it landed in
[04:21:02] <Cork> only if all browsers support it
[04:23:33] <Carlo> Hey guys, any idea why the sliders doesn't work in IE11? http://jsfiddle.net/63X3R/
[04:27:20] <seutje> doesn't jquery 1.7.2 leak like a madman on ie8+?
[04:28:54] <seutje> try with a 1.10 or 1.11
[04:33:05] <Carlo> seutje: same problem with 1.11
[04:33:18] <Madsy^> What's the easiest way to urlencode a string in a form before it's sent, with jQuery?
[04:33:49] <Cork> ?api serialize
[04:33:49] <b-ot> Cork: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[04:33:52] <seutje> Madsy^: if ur trying to serialize the whole form, use .serialize() on the form
[04:34:05] <Cork> ;P
[04:35:13] <Carlo> slider is workin from ie8+, but not in ie11… :/
[04:35:16] <Madsy^> seutje: So I call serialize() in the submit handler on 'this'?
[04:35:30] <Cork> yes
[04:35:43] <Madsy^> Thanks
[04:35:47] <seutje> wouldn't that be on the dom node?
[04:35:54] <Cork> Carlo: are you sure the plugin is compatible with ie11?
[04:36:02] <Cork> they might do some broken ua sniffing or something
[04:36:28] <Cork> seutje: i hope he meant $(this) but i might have assumed too much
[04:37:31] <seutje> Cork: you actually made me check if the method is available on DOM nodes nowadays :P
[04:37:42] <Cork> it isn't
[04:37:46] <xec> lol
[04:37:49] <Cork> native use FormData
[04:38:11] <Cork> .send(new FormData(this));
[04:38:46] <xec> .send()?
[04:38:54] <seutje> yeah, was pretty convinced it isn't
[04:39:04] <Cork> xec: xhr.send()
[04:39:10] <Cork> you know the native ajax :)
[04:40:32] <seutje> oh, didn't know about FormData, how do you use it?
[04:40:41] <seutje> seems to have an append method
[04:40:57] <Cork> seutje: you give it the form and it will grab the fields
[04:41:05] <Cork> you can append file data with append
[04:41:09] <Cork> it won't grab those automatically
[04:41:22] <seutje> yeah, but I mean the object it creates
[04:41:33] <Cork> seutje: basically you need it if you want to do ajax fileuploads
[04:41:35] <xec> ah
[04:41:36] <xec> :D
[04:41:42] <seutje> can't inspect or manipulate it other than append data
[04:41:43] <seutje> ?
[04:41:50] <Cork> ya
[04:42:02] <seutje> oh ok
[04:43:12] <Cork> seutje: you can add each key separately if you don't want the entire form
[04:43:22] <Cork> so there isn't much need to support manipulating it
[04:46:17] <Carlo> Cork: yes, you're right. it's out-dated. rewriting it by using version 6 looks horrible to me. http://refreshless.com/nouislider/
[04:49:14] <abishek> is there a way to find unique colors using javascript. I basically want to ignore the shades of the same color and get back only the unique set from http://jsbin.com/pofub/1/edit
[04:50:05] <Cork> abishek: use hsl?
[04:50:09] <seutje> u wanna know the closest base color?
[04:50:35] <abishek> Cork, what is HSL?
[04:50:37] <seutje> the ones shown there seem pretty unique
[04:50:41] <Cork> ?mdn hsl
[04:50:42] <b-ot> Cork: <color> - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value
[04:50:53] <seutje> hue saturation luminosity
[04:51:06] <seutje> color schema, like rgb, if u will
[04:51:44] <seutje> but hsl doesn't "combine" the colors, but tweaks a single hue with saturation and luminosity
[04:52:15] <abishek> Cork, I am trying to fetch all the colors from an image using HTML 5 canvas, but the problem is it gives me the shades of different colors when iterating the canvas. I want to elimate the shades and only get unique colors on the palette
[04:52:54] <Jattenalle> abishek, define "unique colors"
[04:53:08] <seutje> u want an array with ['red', 'blue', 'green']?
[04:53:47] <mochabcha> if you can define colors using HSL, then iterating over the H value will give you unique hues.
[04:54:16] <abishek> Jattenalle, #007744,#008800,#00ff00 - is shades of green
[04:54:39] <Jattenalle> abishek, so you just want something akin to: Major component = "the color"
[04:54:44] <seutje> but everything is a shade of either red, blue or green
[04:55:02] <Jattenalle> ie: 00ffaa = 00ff00 (green), aabb99 = red?
[04:55:14] <Jattenalle> you need to do more than just assume
[04:55:14] <seutje> is 00ffff a shade of blue or green?
[04:56:02] <Jattenalle> converting to HSL then splitting by H would still give you weird stuff, but i guess it works
[04:56:07] <Jattenalle> it's a really odd thing you want to do
[04:56:36] <Jattenalle> another method, would be to just assign each input to one of the three channels based on a margin
[04:56:51] <Jattenalle> 007744 -> 00ff00, aabb99 -> ffffff
[04:57:06] * Jattenalle shrugs
[04:59:32] <abishek> is there a way to know what color H belongs to if I split and iterate?
[05:00:00] <abishek> sorry if the question is bad, am still trying to figure out abt HSL...
[05:00:37] <Cork> abishek: h is from the color wheel
[05:00:56] <Cork> it follows the normal spectrum
[05:01:43] <Cork> abishek: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue
[05:01:51] <abishek> ok
[05:01:54] <Cork> or specifically https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HueScale.svg
[05:01:55] <seutje> 0-359, pretty much
[05:02:53] <seutje> so it would still give you a range of 360 unique colors
[05:03:08] <seutje> just disregarding all their saturation and luminosity values
[05:03:42] <Cork> well if you take the value and round it to the closest 60 power you have the base colors
[05:04:03] <Cork> 0 red
[05:04:06] <Cork> 50 yellow
[05:04:08] <Cork> *60
[05:04:11] <seutje> yeah, basically just depends on how many unqiue values u wanna end up with
[05:04:14] <Cork> 120 green
[05:04:18] <seutje> how granular, i fu will
[05:04:22] <Cork> 180 cyan
[05:04:26] <Cork> 240 blue
[05:04:32] <Cork> 300 magenta
[05:05:09] <Cork> and 260 is red again
[05:05:13] <Cork> *360
[05:05:28] <mochabcha> you have 7 major colors; red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.  There are also two primes and neutrals like brown and such.  The problem is clarifying what defines a 'unique color'.  Shades are unique colors if thats the only shade that exists in source image.  So you must first gather all the colors, then define which are "close enough" shades of other unique colors to group the colors by similarity.
[05:05:29] <mochabcha>   Is burgundy a unique color, or just a shade of red?
[05:05:41] <seutje> omg workie
[05:05:46] <seutje> ups, wrong window
[05:05:48] <Jattenalle> sillyColor = Math.floor(H / 60)?
[05:05:56] <Jattenalle> should give 0 through 5
[05:06:08] <mochabcha> is brown a unique color or just a shadow of yellow?
[05:06:14] <Cork> you might want round instead of floor though
[05:06:15] <seutje> hahaha
[05:06:21] <Jattenalle> mochabcha, we alraedy went over that.. it's a really silly thing to do
[05:06:31] <Jattenalle> Cork that'll break it, floor is what you want
[05:06:33] <seutje> brown is the combination of all color with a lack of luminosity
[05:06:39] <seutje> grey is the same with a lack of saturation
[05:06:45] <Jattenalle> Cork, since it maxes at 359, not 360
[05:07:02] <Cork> Jattenalle: why should no floor would be strange
[05:07:11] <Cork> as 59 should be 60 not 0
[05:07:27] <Jattenalle> oh, right, yeah it needs an offset
[05:07:28] <Jattenalle> my bad
[05:07:30] <Cork> and you just do % 360 at the end
[05:07:41] <seutje> so for brown the hue would probably be somewhere between 20-40 to get an added orange effect
[05:08:00] <SprkDEV> Anyone know of a good jquery plugin that crops and uploads? Would like something that can easily be used on mobile devices.
[05:08:16] <SprkDEV> Cropping on mobile devices would be difficult withount mouse. Any ideas?
[05:08:37] <beancurd> well you'd just need the crop handles, then click and hold.
[05:08:44] <beancurd> would have to make them extra big though.
[05:09:07] <mochabcha> http://www.jqueryrain.com/demo/jquery-crop-image-plugin/  here's a start...
[05:09:23] <mochabcha> a bunch of them and they're all jquery or php plugins.
[05:10:05] <Cork> Jattenalle: i actually implemented a dynamic theming for a page based on this a few years back :)
[05:10:26] <Jattenalle> heh
[05:10:33] <Cork> it was kinda cool actually
[05:10:39] <Jattenalle> i'm too used to working with RGB values
[05:10:50] <Cork> ya, me too
[05:11:32] <Cork> but that one was that you picked a color and all colors on the page was saturation + lumination based on that color
[05:11:36] <Cork> it worked really well
[05:12:19] <mochabcha> is there a reason why .on() fires at load time and doesn't register an event handler like it should?
[05:12:43] <Jattenalle> Cork, aye, HSV definitely has its uses
[05:12:47] <Cork> mochabcha: you pass the function with () ?
[05:12:59] <Jattenalle> HSL*
[05:13:04] <Cork> Jattenalle: ya, everything need to be built for it though
[05:13:14] <Cork> so graphicers tend to pull there hair :)
[05:13:33] <Cork> "no you can't put a shade of red on there"
[05:13:54] <Jattenalle> hehe
[05:14:02] <mochabcha> cork i'm not real sure.  I have it here if you have time to look at it real quick http://69.16.249.50/~firstupf/wp-content/themes/twentythirteen/js/animate.js
[05:14:42] <Cork> mochabcha: witch one?
[05:15:52] <mochabcha> cork: there are two.  the ones that register webkit
[05:16:02] <mochabcha> cork: there are two.  the ones that register webkitAnimationStart and webkitAnimationEnd are fine.
[05:17:15] <mochabcha> cork: the dynamic one is the problem.  $(this).on(stringAnimationTrigger, doAnimation($(this), stringAnimationTrigger, animation, delay));
[05:17:30] <Cork> ya
[05:17:37] <Cork> mochabcha: your calling the function not passing it
[05:17:51] <Cork> $(this).on(stringAnimationTrigger, function() { doAnimation($(this), stringAnimationTrigger, animation, delay) });
[05:17:51] <mochabcha> whats the difference?
[05:17:57] <Cork> () executes the function
[05:18:02] <Cork> without you get a reference to it
[05:18:15] <Cork> doAnimation is a function reference
[05:18:20] <Cork> doAnimation() is an execution
[05:18:35] <mochabcha> so I need to encapsulate doAnimation() in a function ()
[05:18:39] <Cork> yes
[05:18:46] <mochabcha> BRILLIANT!
[05:18:53] <Cork> mochabcha: what you did was call doAnimation and then sent the return value from it to .on
[05:19:48] <mochabcha> ahhhhhh.....which is kinda useless.  on event.click.....true
[05:32:26] <SprkDEV> I've found this jquery plugin, but even though all the files are there in github, its difficult to get what I need from this. How do I implement this? Can anyone help with a small example? croppic.net
[05:36:13] <Cork> SprkDEV: you most likely want to download the .zip file and use that
[05:36:45] <SprkDEV> I have. I've downloaded it. Don't know where to begin. Everthing is in seperate files and there are so many.
[05:37:00] <SprkDEV> Right now I am looking online for jsfiddle examples that would do what I want.
[05:38:06] <Cork> SprkDEV: just skimmed it a bit, but it looks like it depends on croppic.css and croppic.js
[05:38:58] <SprkDEV> yeah.  I'd like to condense that done to one file to understand how to implement it. Really I need the jquery, php and css.
[05:39:05] <SprkDEV> down*
[05:42:07] <Cork> SprkDEV: most here would prob have to dig into the plugin inorder to give you those hints
[05:42:17] <Cork> so dig in and get dirty
[05:43:06] <SprkDEV> trying to do that. But also since I want this plugin to work on mobile devices, I have so few options to choose from. To crop on a mobile device its best to use a box cropper (like this one).
[05:43:13] <SprkDEV> But this one doesn't support IE9.
[05:51:03] <computer2000> anyone knows if its not anymore possible to control animations in isotope 2.0? seems to have lost some options
[06:06:16] <simonj89> howcome my jquery is working locally
[06:06:30] <simonj89> but not when I have published? http://woms.azurewebsites.net/job .. Needs mobile spoofer
[06:08:00] <Cork> simonj89: your minifier appear to be breaking the scripts
[06:08:48] <simonj89> maps one?
[06:08:59] <Cork> check your browser console
[06:11:26] <simonj89> getting a huge error from maps I think?
[06:14:44] <simonj89> @cork im getting a wierd error
[06:15:47] <Cork> simonj89: i get warnings for missing jQuery
[06:15:55] <Cork> so something is making jquery fail
[06:16:13] <Cork> and honestly i can't even tell if that is jquery or not
[06:16:42] <Cork> and i'm WAY to lazy to try to deofuscate it
[06:25:27] <simonj89> http://woms.azurewebsites.net/Incident/Create .. why is jquery failing ? Works locally
[06:32:05] <Zalem-Developer> is anyone using the Kendo UI Grid?  have a problem with the footer
[06:32:10] <Zalem-Developer> footer template
[06:32:33] <BinaryKitten> Zalem-Developer ask the question.
[06:32:52] <BinaryKitten> don't wait for us to say that we're using the "Kendo UI Grid"
[06:33:04] <BinaryKitten> also, is the Kendo UI Grid a jQuery component
[06:33:27] <beancurd> iirc it is.
[06:33:36] <beancurd> but it's telerik poop.
[06:33:41] <BinaryKitten> beancurd i know it uses jQuery
[06:33:50] <BinaryKitten> but is it a jQuery component?
[06:34:10] <BinaryKitten> because otherwise it's up to the company that builds it/sells it to support it?
[06:34:16] <beancurd> oh you mean part of jquery ui/etc? yeah then no.
[06:34:22] <Zalem-Developer> i am using the kendo grid and in the footer i have totals...the application blows up if the value is null.  i'm trying to figure out how to put a conditional statment within:   columns.Bound(c => c.Flowtime).Title("Time").Format(numericalformat).FooterTemplate(@<text>@item.Sum.Format(numericalformat)</text>)
[06:34:24] <beancurd> yep. totally a telerik problem.
[06:34:48] <Zalem-Developer> this is being built on the server and not the client...
[06:34:50] <BinaryKitten> Zalem-Developer have you checked http://www.telerik.com/forums ?
[06:35:08] <BinaryKitten> because that's not standard jQuery data
[06:35:16] <Zalem-Developer> yes, i have
[06:35:33] <BinaryKitten> so, it's more likely you'll get a good response from telerik, their support or their forums
[06:35:33] <beancurd> yeah, you'll get much further just lodging a support ticket, you're paying good money for it after all.
[06:36:05] <Zalem-Developer> ok, thanks
[06:36:28] <joroci> how can i select all text inputs with text in them?
[06:36:37] <joroci> value*
[06:37:15] <beancurd> $("input").val();
[06:37:36] <joroci> no, i want all the input elements with value in them
[06:37:43] <joroci> not the actual value
[06:37:53] <BinaryKitten> jorge_lo $(':text').filter(function() { return this.value.length > 0; });
[06:37:56] <BinaryKitten> oops
[06:38:02] <BinaryKitten> joroci $(':text').filter(function() { return this.value.length > 0; });
[06:38:16] <BinaryKitten> or
[06:38:22] <BinaryKitten> switch :text for input
[06:38:33] <joroci> is that the fastest way to do it?
[06:38:36] <BinaryKitten> yes
[06:38:46] <joroci> thanks :)
[06:39:31] <BinaryKitten> faster would be to store the base selection as a var and filter it  later
[06:39:39] <BinaryKitten> so that you save the dom search time
[06:40:44] <joroci> yea, but the amount of inputs can change
[06:40:50] <joroci> that is good
[06:53:13] <simonj89> http://woms.azurewebsites.net/Incident/Create
[06:53:22] <simonj89> how can I debug these JS errors
[06:54:44] <BillCriswell> simonj89: You didn't include jQuery is the first error.
[06:55:16] <simonj89> its working locally but not on azure :/
[06:55:51] <BillCriswell> simonj89: You're using $ before jQuery is included actually.
[06:56:10] <BillCriswell> You can't use $ before it's defined. You're using it in the header but jQuery is loaded before </body>.
[06:57:00] <simonj89> ah!
[06:58:04] <simonj89> so move bundles to body?
[06:58:42] <BillCriswell> Not sure what bundles are. You just want to use $ after <script src="jquery"></script> .
[06:59:55] <simonj89> after as in above
[07:00:01] <simonj89> it reads from bottom to top?
[07:00:13] <BillCriswell> No, top to bottom.
[07:00:19] <fx11> hi guys
[07:00:25] <simonj89> ok
[07:00:31] <BillCriswell> <script src="jquery"></script> anything after this can use $.
[07:01:09] <fx11> why script doesn't work after I click link to page with script?
[07:02:33] <BillCriswell> fx11: Your question is really confusing. It sounds like you should just be asking why the script on the page your on isn't working?
[07:02:49] <fx11> ok
[07:03:47] <fx11> script on A.html, I load page, script work then click B.html and back, script doesn't work
[07:04:33] <fx11> "back" I mean click A.html link on B.html
[07:04:35] <BillCriswell> fx11: Are you also loading script on B.html ?
[07:04:40] <fx11> nope
[07:05:04] <sunbeam> is there a way to detect if the mouse is inside a div?
[07:05:25] <BillCriswell> You should post your code at jsfiddle.net and share it cause I'm not sure what you're going for.
[07:05:43] <sunbeam> I mean if the mouse is hovered over a certain div?
[07:06:08] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: You can add a class to it on mouseenter or something. What do you need to do to the div if the mouse of hovered over it?
[07:06:27] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: not execute a certain action
[07:06:34] <sunbeam> and do execute that function if its not
[07:06:45] <simonj89> thanks bill sorted
[07:06:50] <simonj89> how do I @ somebody?
[07:06:53] <BillCriswell> simonj89: Awesome.
[07:07:01] <simonj89> http://woms.azurewebsites.net/Incident/Create can you tell me anything about the datetime picker
[07:07:13] <BillCriswell> simonj89: You would just say their name to get their attention. You could proabably tab completely their names in your client.
[07:07:19] <simonj89> it also worked locally, some issues with UK validation but its a right mess on azure !
[07:08:44] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: I guess I'd just add a class to the div on mouseenter and remove it on mouseleave, then in my function check like if ($('.some-div').hasClass('go-for-it')) doSomething
[07:09:31] <sunbeam> ok yep
[07:09:32] <sunbeam> thanks
[07:09:32] <ddssc> got a table for which I can't assess the height. neither my browser or any jquery method can get me the height of this table. it's a table embedded in a row of another table btw
[07:11:59] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Are you testing this on the same element something is happening on?
[07:12:37] <star_prone> is there a log of these conversations?
[07:13:09] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://jsbin.com/bolalamu/1/edit?html,js,output is what I was thinking, obviously need to "click" the button using your keyboard to get the alert and your mouse has to be over meow.
[07:13:20] <BillCriswell> star_prone: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[07:14:19] <star_prone> BillCriswell: thanks
[07:14:20] <Elirips> Isn't there something built-in in jquery to get the url without params and an object with all url-parameters?
[07:15:01] <BillCriswell> Elirips: There's location.pathname and location.search
[07:16:00] <BillCriswell> Elirips: in the console type location and check out that object.
[07:16:04] <simonj89> anybody with mobile spoofer can try click one of these ?
[07:16:06] <simonj89> http://woms.azurewebsites.net/job
[07:17:14] <Elirips> BillCriswell: pretty cool, it even strips off the fragments into its own property. thx
[07:19:04] <Elirips> [OT] btw, does someone know. If I have a fragment (anchor) in my url, does it have to be the very last part of the url after the params, or could it also be before the params and still be a valid url? Like: 'http://foo.com?p1=v1&p2=v2#anchor' vs. 'http://foo.com#anchor?p1=v1&p2=v2' ?
[07:19:04] <BillCriswell> Elirips: No problem.
[07:19:18] <BillCriswell> Elirips: After.
[07:19:39] <BillCriswell> Er wait
[07:19:43] <z3yo> How can I get a value into a JS closure from outside ?
[07:20:26] <Elirips> BillCriswell: I would also say that it has to be the very last part to be a valid url, but I'm not sure.
[07:20:34] <Elirips> and I cannot find a definition
[07:22:28] <BillCriswell> I'm always certain it's always /path?parameter=foo#anchor
[07:23:05] <BillCriswell> Almost*
[07:30:00] <fx11> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/u6m3D/8/ I rly don't know why doesn't working
[07:30:16] <fx11> I'm newbie at js
[07:31:50] <BillCriswell> fx11: Since you're clicking a link you have to keep the link from going to another page. You would use event.preventDefault() to do that: http://jsfiddle.net/u6m3D/10/
[07:32:46] <BillCriswell> fx11: Here it is using .closest('tr') instead of .parent().parent() http://jsfiddle.net/u6m3D/11/
[07:33:00] <fx11> BillCriswell, ok thx
[07:34:25] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[07:34:43] <fx11> <BillCriswell> document.ready need every js? or one for js file?
[07:34:56] <SprkDEV> why do I get error at (document).ready(function() { ...
[07:35:11] <SprkDEV> the error is ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[07:35:31] <simonj89> woo I know this one
[07:36:15] <simonj89> have u included Jquery above the script Sprk?
[07:37:33] <jphase> SprkDEV: if you're working within wordpress you'll probably want:  jQuery(document).ready(function($){
[07:37:39] <BillCriswell> fx11: Depends where you're using you're including your scripts.
[07:38:14] <BillCriswell> fx11: If you put it after all your body's html you don't need the document ready, if you put it in the <head> you will.
[07:38:35] <fx11> BillCriswell: thanks
[07:38:59] <SprkDEV> nah that aint working either. it says jquery not defined.
[07:39:21] <BillCriswell> Are you typing jQuery or jquery?
[07:40:01] <krisek101> Hi. How can I save data returned from $.ajax{ type: GET}? I know what is the json. But that data are returned and i can use it only in success : function()
[07:41:40] <krisek101> Is something method to save that returned data?
[07:43:07] <BillCriswell> krisek101: It's only available in the callback.
[07:45:34] <krisek101> so can't I use that data later?
[07:46:07] <BillCriswell> krisek101: Of course you can.
[07:46:29] <krisek101> How? :D
[07:46:39] <krisek101> by xml maybe?
[07:46:43] <BillCriswell> $.get('something.json', doSomethingWithJSON); then do whatever you need to do with it in that function.
[07:46:53] <BillCriswell> krisek101: I have no idea why you'd even go down that route.
[07:48:35] <simonj89> can someone try select a datetime
[07:48:42] <simonj89> no so bothered about the failing css atm lol
[07:51:58] <krisek101> BillCriswell: I just want to know it. In php script i can save data to database, so can I to save that data in xml?
[07:52:15] <BillCriswell> If you have json why would you want it as XML?
[07:52:47] <simonj89> BillCriswell any ideas?
[07:53:32] <krisek101> BillCriswell: because i want to save that data?
[07:53:33] <z3yo> How can I get a value into a JS closure from outside ?
[07:54:09] <BillCriswell> krisek101: So you just want some save a string of XML to your database?
[07:54:53] <krisek101> no, i dont want use database. And without database i want to save that data;D
[07:55:49] <t432> anyone familiar with https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll/blob/master/Readme.md ?
[07:56:36] <BillCriswell> krisek101: You'd just have to setup the getJSON as the starting point for what you need to do with that data.
[07:59:44] <BillCriswell> krisek101: http://jsbin.com/fehexeni/1/edit?js,output here's something that might help out.
[08:00:34] <krisek101> ok I try to understand it ;)
[08:02:54] <Hyperking> I need help. why isn't a class being added? http://bpaste.net/show/BYV7xDijBlaahd63eoPj/
[08:02:57] <BillCriswell> z3yo: Defined it in the outer scope, or pass it into the closure.
[08:04:14] <krisek101> BillCriswell: Ok. getJSON download data in json from something file. But how can I create that file? I understand it's making in php?
[08:05:33] <simonj89> ok fixed everything
[08:05:45] <simonj89> can somebody test this on moble/spoof
[08:05:50] <simonj89> and let me know the result?
[08:05:52] <simonj89> http://woms.azurewebsites.net/job
[08:05:57] <jphase> krisek101: make an array/object in PHP (or any other server-side language) and do echo json_encode($yourdata);
[08:05:59] <simonj89> just click the job. I have some problem
[08:06:01] <jphase> or die rather :\
[08:06:06] <simonj89> I think
[08:07:45] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: http://jsbin.com/hicoface/2/edit?js,output working here.
[08:08:07] <BillCriswell> simonj89: Are you using Chrome?
[08:08:52] <simonj89> Chrome spoofer yeah, same issue on an actual mobile though
[08:09:20] <simonj89> I think its MVC problem for me thought, rather than the Jquerymobile .. maybe
[08:09:36] <BillCriswell> simonj89: No idea.
[08:09:46] <simonj89> do u notice the url?
[08:09:49] <simonj89> doesnt change
[08:10:10] <simonj89> to /job/details/1
[08:10:45] <SprkDEV> #yii
[08:11:18] <krisek101> I created an array in PHP with data and next to I used json_encode. The data was returned to the js and in callback in ajax I can use that array. This i undserstand. But how can I save that data to the some separate file and use this array in some another action?
[08:11:46] <BillCriswell> simonj89: I'm not seeing anything jquery mobileish here.
[08:12:10] <simonj89> hold on bill ill force mobile
[08:12:16] <BillCriswell> krisek101: Why wouldn't you just get the data from PHP?
[08:12:40] <BillCriswell> Not sure why you'd clone the data in the first place.
[08:12:46] <t432> if i have a embedded style inside html for a div with display:none, can i use query to remove display: none from one of the elements?
[08:13:19] <simonj89> could you try iphone 4 in chrome bill?
[08:13:36] <BillCriswell> t432: .attr('style', ''); maybe?
[08:13:50] <t432> i'll try that.
[08:14:25] <decx> .removeAttr('style')
[08:14:46] <BillCriswell> .... dur
[08:14:52] <simonj89> or windows phone
[08:15:06] <decx> or .show() :>
[08:15:07] <BillCriswell> simonj89: YEah doesnt seem to work.
[08:15:25] <BillCriswell> decx: or.... .addClass('.makeVisibile')
[08:15:40] <decx> that wouldnt override an inline style="display:none"
[08:15:57] <BillCriswell> I'll important the shit out of that.
[08:16:04] <decx> *gasp*
[08:16:24] <simonj89> thats odd
[08:16:27] <t432> decx: removal will be temporary, trying to show a message while the content is loading.  I will add it back once the content has finished loading.
[08:16:27] <krisek101> BillCriswell: OK. So in php i have to create new file and in this file places contetnt from json_encode($data)?
[08:17:02] <BillCriswell> krisek101: Why don't you just keep requesting what's returning thejson_encode($data) though.
[08:17:38] <BillCriswell> t432: How is the style getting there in the first place?
[08:18:06] <t432> BillCriswell: hard coded
[08:18:14] <decx> so you have a hidden "loading" that you want to show during loading?
[08:18:45] <t432> i have a block of code hard coded into the html, that I am trying to display only when there is an ajax call
[08:18:54] <decx> eh guess that's one way of doing it. i prefer not having rogue text
[08:19:29] <t432> once the call has finished i'd like that block of code disappear.
[08:19:33] <star_prone> I have asked this question on friday too and cork helped me with it but it seems it's still not working
[08:19:39] <t432> text, rather
[08:20:19] <simonj89> anyone else able to test http://woms.azurewebsites.net/job on mobile/spoofer?
[08:20:21] <star_prone> on a page I have a variable number of inputs and then I can also add others dinamically with jquery. the initial buttons have an event attach to them
[08:20:37] <decx> i like something like addClass('loading') and then some css .loading:before { content: "here be loading text" }
[08:21:20] <star_prone> the new buttons will also have some event  attached this way: $j("#options-table").on('click', ".option-remove", function() {}
[08:22:27] <star_prone> the problem is that everythime i click that button. the numer the event request appears in console.log is idetical with the number of buttons on the page
[08:22:42] <star_prone> is there anything that I could do about?
[08:22:48] <krisek101> BillCriswell: I have to save that data.
[08:30:18] <jab3z> Hi. Can anyone recommend me some wysiwyg html5 editors which are using jquery or javascript?
[08:33:42] <decx> wysiwyg will only give you old shit like ckeditor, the searchterm du jour is: rich text editor
[08:35:38] <jab3z> decx: Rich text editor is not referring only to the text content? I want to be able to add html blocks as well.
[08:35:42] <Toaster_Strudel> I'm not sure if I need jquery help or CSS help.. http://jsfiddle.net/jwKP7/
[08:36:10] <Toaster_Strudel> "test expand"isn't working
[08:36:50] <NicholasC> Toaster_Strudel, you might want to start loading in Jquery :)
[08:36:58] <decx> jab3z yes it does, but it has become the prevalent description. sadly i'm still stuck with ckeditor everywhere i do use one of these so i can't recommend something by heart
[08:37:21] <Toaster_Strudel> NicholasC: what chu mean?
[08:39:06] <NicholasC> Toaster_Strudel, one sec.
[08:41:15] <phelix> I have added this identically to my site. http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/nFrte?editors=111 but I get a "TypeError: $ is not a function $( function() {" I am adding it exactly how the example shows.. what am I missing? Anyone know?
[08:43:00] <NicholasC> Toaster_Strudel, http://jsfiddle.net/jwKP7/2/ you forgot your $(function(){ });, as well as used the wrong selector ".tools" instead of ".header"
[08:44:59] <jab3z> decx: thanks :)
[08:45:49] <Toaster_Strudel> NicholasC: ok, thanks
[08:45:59] <phelix> I changed the first line from that example to this. jQuery(function ($) { and it made it to the next function and now gives me that same error about that function
[08:46:19] <phelix> Am I completly missing something? Why would none of his functions work the way they have created them?
[08:49:23] <NicholasC> Toaster_Strudel, http://jsfiddle.net/jwKP7/6/ this should be a more elegant solution
[08:49:41] <NicholasC> phelix, are you including jQuery on your page?
[08:50:27] <NicholasC> phelix, <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script> try adding that above your code and see if that works. You'll also want the first line to be $(function(){
[08:52:32] <phelix> NicholasC: Yes
[08:52:57] <NicholasC> phelix, alright, let's have a look at the codepen then
[08:53:05] <phelix> NicholasC: http://marcwaltersphotography.dev.tributemedia.com/ you can see here
[08:53:33] <NicholasC> cheers, gimme a sec
[08:54:04] <phelix> np
[08:55:05] <jab3z> come on, mates. No good wysiwyg html5 editors?
[08:55:43] <NicholasC> phelix, remove the space between $( and function()
[08:56:15] <phelix> k done
[08:58:23] <NicholasC> phelix, I'm not sure what's going wrong but I'm probably overlooking something really simple.
[08:58:30] <NicholasC> Luckily for you, duch_kazatel just showed up.
[08:58:48] <phelix> yeah I would imagine that it is something stupid and simple
[08:59:13] <NicholasC> phelix, one tip though; load all your scripts in the footer of your body.
[08:59:38] <phelix> I know if i change the first function to jQuery(function($){
[08:59:50] <phelix> it removes the error from that function but then it gives the same error on the next function down
[08:59:51] <duch_kazatel> wha3t’s going on?
[08:59:53] <phelix> not sure if its something like so
[09:00:16] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, http://marcwaltersphotography.dev.tributemedia.com/ it's BORKED captain.
[09:00:24] <phelix> trying to implement this into my site. http://marcwaltersphotography.dev.tributemedia.com/ Here is where i am taking it. Its an exact copy. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/IkeLx
[09:00:26] <NicholasC> And the page is a mess and I have no clue where to start :D
[09:00:40] <phelix> but getting weird function errors, sure its something simple
[09:00:59] <duch_kazatel> where is flexslider getting called from?
[09:01:02] <duch_kazatel> because that’s probably your issue.
[09:01:15] <phelix> letme disable all that other js
[09:01:22] <duch_kazatel> holy wowzer those are some imports.
[09:01:33] <phelix> i know huh. Its the power of drupal
[09:01:45] <duch_kazatel> i don’t know if I’d call that “powerful.
[09:01:54] <phelix> true lol
[09:02:03] <duch_kazatel> also, you have duplicated html opening tags.
[09:02:06] <duch_kazatel> that’s going to cause problems.
[09:02:25] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/Gb2aXVP.png
[09:02:28] <duch_kazatel> that’s no bueno.
[09:02:45] <BillCriswell> Holy moly.
[09:03:22] <phelix> Well, don't think there is anything I can do about that. Its how drupal creates its headers.
[09:03:41] <duch_kazatel> then you’re hosed, because jquery can work around a lot of broken things, but that’s a fundamental issue.
[09:03:44] <duch_kazatel> you’ll need to correct that.
[09:04:00] <duch_kazatel> also, I see two different “equal heights” plugins getting loaded.
[09:04:03] <phelix> ive never had a jquery script not work using drupal
[09:04:04] <NicholasC> phelix, any way you can stick your script calls into your footer?
[09:04:13] <phelix> yah I could
[09:04:14] <NicholasC> Just include them in the html body of that footer?
[09:04:15] <duch_kazatel> brb restart.
[09:04:45] <phelix> let me just try and pull all this outta drupal and in its own file. Would be easier to troubleshoot
[09:07:23] <duch_kazatel> yaaay restarts
[09:09:11] <phelix> http://chamber.tributemedia.com/isotope.php
[09:09:20] <phelix> hah, interesting. Works perfectly in its own file
[09:09:39] <duch_kazatel> start by fixing that html tag problem.
[09:09:42] <duch_kazatel> that needs to be issue #1
[09:13:04] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I have fixed that html tag issue
[09:15:00] <krambiorix> when i click in an input field with a tooltip on , in a dialog, the dialog scrolls to top.... What can i do?!
[09:15:12] <NicholasC> krambiorix, show us your code.
[09:15:45] <duch_kazatel> phelix could you link your scripts file?
[09:15:47] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, what were those bot commands again here?
[09:15:53] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ krambiorix
[09:15:53] <b-ot> krambiorix: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:15:55] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:16:24] <duch_kazatel> phelix make sure to put your stuff in a separate file and link it if you're not all ready.
[09:16:43] <phelix> you mean my initialize script for this?
[09:16:51] <phelix> instead of putting it inside the html put it in a seperate file?
[09:16:53] <duch_kazatel> phelix i mean any JS you have written.
[09:16:58] <phelix> k
[09:16:59] <duch_kazatel> yes, put it in a separate file.
[09:18:02] <duch_kazatel> brb again
[09:18:55] <phelix> ok done. It is inside custom.js
[09:19:28] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, i found out it's a bug : http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9364
[09:19:50] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, awesome. Sorry for the delay, was dealing with a down'd server.
[09:20:48] <duch_kazatel> back.
[09:21:32] <duch_kazatel> one sec, dealing with stuff :D
[09:24:18] <duch_kazatel> phelix why are you using jquery 1.5?
[09:24:35] <phelix> dunno. I can change the version
[09:24:51] <duch_kazatel> that's about 3 years old.  upgrade to 1.10 or 1.11
[09:25:28] <phelix> what about 1.8 ?
[09:25:41] <duch_kazatel> if you can go more recent, to so.
[09:25:47] <phelix> its highest supported version that i can manually change to.
[09:25:58] <duch_kazatel> huh?  highest supported for what?
[09:26:03] <fission6> can i make this in one selection $('.post_body img, .post_body iframe')
[09:26:16] <fission6> how do i do img or iframe in one select
[09:26:23] <phelix> to easily modify using this drupal module. I can always just remove that module and manually put a newer verson in
[09:26:44] <duch_kazatel> fission6 $('.post_body').find('img, iframe');
[09:26:51] <phelix> but see moving up to version 1.8 breaks my main slideshow
[09:27:14] <duch_kazatel> phelix are all of your plugins compatible with 1.5?
[09:27:27] <phelix> let me double check something
[09:27:50] <phelix> ok there we go. its using 1.8 now
[09:27:56] <phelix> and the slideshow on the page still is working
[09:28:15] <fission6> thanks
[09:29:02] <duch_kazatel> 1.9 broke a lot of backwards compatibility. phelix, this will sound silly, but try adding a semicolon to the beginning of your custom JS. -> ;$(function() {
[09:29:32] <phelix> done
[09:29:36] <snerkpudding> I'm trying to override Datepicker's _generateHTML function (jQuery UI), but $.ui.datepicker.prototype is undefined. Why?
[09:29:54] <duch_kazatel> phelix okay, undo that.
[09:29:59] <phelix> k
[09:30:13] <duch_kazatel> try removing each plugin, one at a time, until the error goes away.
[09:30:23] <phelix> k
[09:30:24] <duch_kazatel> that's where you're at now - you have to check to see which one is throwing the error.
[09:30:34] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ snerkpudding
[09:30:34] <b-ot> snerkpudding: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:30:42] <phelix> so you think that one of these scripts the site is loading is breaking this?
[09:30:58] <duch_kazatel> phelix that's very likely.  or there is some malformed js somewhere.
[09:31:25] <duch_kazatel> you're using relatively old versions of jquery - you might have a plugin that doesn't play well with the pre 1.9 world.
[09:32:59] <snerkpudding> duch_kazatel: No code to paste . The only thing I did was load jQuery and jQuery UI. Then I tried calling $.ui.datepicker.prototype in console (chrome dev tools)
[09:33:22] <snerkpudding> Result: undefined
[09:34:00] <duch_kazatel> what happens if you call $.ui.datepicker instead?
[09:34:04] <snerkpudding> However, if I call $.ui.progressbar.prototype, then I get the object
[09:34:38] <snerkpudding> $.ui.datepicker gives the object
[09:34:42] <phelix> duch_kazatel: ok I have removed all scripts and manually added the isotope.js and the jquery
[09:34:52] <snerkpudding> but there is no prototype member
[09:35:07] <duch_kazatel> phelix did you remove one at a time and reload the page to see when the error went again?
[09:35:34] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, I am happy I passed that one over to you. Sorry about that.
[09:35:41] <phelix> Well, not so simple as just print $scripts; in drupal is adding them all. I just commented that line out and added only what was needed for this to start
[09:35:57] <phelix> but even with them all off there are now no errors but its not functioning.. hmm
[09:36:02] <duch_kazatel> phelix you need to remove each script to see which one is throwing the errors.
[09:36:20] <duch_kazatel> snerkpudding try $.ui.Datepicker.prototype maybe?
[09:36:28] <duch_kazatel> snerkpudding -> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/datepicker.js
[09:39:10] <snerkpudding> duch_kazatel, ui.Datepicker is undefined. This is weird. It seems like the datepicker doesn't support overriding methods the same way other widgets do
[09:39:28] <snerkpudding> * I meant $.ui.Datepicker ofc
[09:39:30] <duch_kazatel> let me poke.
[09:42:17] <duch_kazatel> something tells me it has to do with the widget factory pattern different between the two.
[09:42:37] <phelix> duch_kazatel: well it seems even when I disabled every single one it still would not work
[09:42:37] <Genesis_> so I am trying to create a sliding banner in javascript (new to JS)
[09:42:38] <Genesis_> http://pastebin.com/A7zuJJ5v
[09:42:41] <duch_kazatel> try extending the datepicker object instead of mucking with the prototype maybe?
[09:42:41] <Genesis_> this is what I have so far
[09:42:44] <Genesis_> it works amazingly well
[09:42:55] <duch_kazatel> phelix we're trying to fix an error.
[09:42:56] <Genesis_> my only thing is, when it finishes getting to the end of the array
[09:42:59] <Genesis_> I want it to repeat
[09:43:02] <phelix> can we see if we can get it working with no other scripts enabled then I can manually slowly add them back till it breaks/
[09:43:03] <Genesis_> so it will go through the array again
[09:43:05] <Genesis_> how could I do that?
[09:43:24] <duch_kazatel> Genesis_ please setup a working example on something like jsfiddle.com instead please :)
[09:43:46] <phelix> Then at least I can see which script is causing the problem. Removing them one by one will be hard to tell as it doesn't even work with them all removed.
[09:43:51] <phelix> not sure what im looking for going this route
[09:43:57] <duch_kazatel> phelix the console.
[09:44:04] <Genesis_> duch_kazatel: I'm using a locally stored .txt file and images
[09:44:08] <duch_kazatel> phelix you want to disable one, check the console for errors, next.
[09:44:10] <Genesis_> http://jsfiddle.net/jQMP7/
[09:44:15] <Genesis_> here is what I have so far
[09:44:27] <Genesis_> i guess we could make it read from a present array
[09:44:33] <Genesis_> let me set that up
[09:44:45] <duch_kazatel> and decouple it from your ajax, too :)
[09:45:04] <duch_kazatel> also, http://callbackhell.com/
[09:45:05] <duch_kazatel> :)\
[09:45:24] <phelix> duch_kazatel: ok removing the flexslider js , now the only errors are with the script I am trying to use
[09:45:42] <duch_kazatel> link again?
[09:45:55] <phelix> http://marcwaltersphotography.dev.tributemedia.com/
[09:46:21] <duch_kazatel> keep going.
[09:46:38] <duch_kazatel> remove one at a time, check, if you still have console errors, add it back and move up one.
[09:46:49] <phelix> But the errors are gone
[09:46:59] <phelix> except the error that I am getting from the script we are trying to get working
[09:47:00] <duch_kazatel> nope, you're still getting ewrrors.
[09:47:15] <phelix> I only see error from custom.js
[09:47:16] <duch_kazatel> right, the issue is that you've got a malformed/bad script somewhere.
[09:47:30] <phelix> ahh, ok remove them until custom.js no longer errors?
[09:47:42] <duch_kazatel> until you get no errors, period.
[09:47:42] <NicholasC> that's the idea, phelix.
[09:48:02] <duch_kazatel> you've basically got an error cascading through ALL of your javascript.
[09:48:04] <NicholasC> That's what duch_kazatel has been suggesting all this time :)
[09:48:07] <duch_kazatel> that's what's causing your headaches.
[09:48:30] <NicholasC> You've got some nice photographs though. Very pretty.
[09:48:32] <duch_kazatel> so you remove one, check for errors, if there's still an error, add that one back and go to the next one.
[09:49:11] <snerkpudding> duch_kazatel It seems datepicker is the black sheep of jQuery UI widgets: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6228
[09:49:22] <duch_kazatel> snerkpudding there you go :)
[09:49:23] <snerkpudding> duch_kazatel: I will search for a work-around
[09:49:41] <duch_kazatel> snerkpudding i'd write your own plugin at that poin.
[09:50:27] <snerkpudding> duch_kazatel: It's a shame though. I was hoping to load jQuery UI from a CDN and then only rewrite the _generateHTML function (to keep loading times to a minimum)
[09:50:48] <snerkpudding> duch_kazatel: Thanks for your inputs :)
[09:51:06] <duch_kazatel> snerkpudding you could do a custom build and write your own datepicker or something.  or do the communal thing and convert it to the factory pattern and submit a PR.
[09:52:43] <funkt> Hi there I am trying to get a div to change colour depending on the time of day I have got so far http://jsbin.com/ticiwegu/1/edit and failed could anyone shed any light?
[09:53:19] <snerkpudding> duch_kazatel: I will start out with a custom build (for minimum file size), and when I have enough understanding of jQuery UI, try to help the community on this issue :)
[09:53:32] <duch_kazatel> funkt -> jQuery('timeofday-bg'); should be jQuery('.timeofday-bg');
[09:53:49] <duch_kazatel> snerkpudding word :D
[09:56:51] <funkt> Thank you I have edited it http://jsbin.com/ticiwegu/3/edit and I am still not getting anywhere
[09:57:35] <duch_kazatel> funkt you realize you have to add jquery to that, right? http://i.imgur.com/Vhk73wF.png
[09:57:45] <duch_kazatel> funkt without that, you can't run jquer.
[09:57:47] <duch_kazatel> *jquery
[09:58:15] <duch_kazatel> funkt also, you only need to add the before to the selector.  none of the addClass() method calls need it.
[09:58:24] <duch_kazatel> divs.addClass('.morning-bg') should still be divs.addClass('morning-bg'), for instance.
[09:59:05] <phelix> I went through and disabled each one, one at a time and the error never went away.... this must mean its a combination of more than one script causing this?
[09:59:34] <duch_kazatel> phelix do you have any javascript on the page that isn't in a separate file?
[09:59:48] <phelix> nope they are all in seperate files now
[10:00:20] <funkt> cheers! Ive never used jsbin before
[10:00:25] <duch_kazatel> phelix http://i.imgur.com/vQhFTul.png
[10:00:29] <duch_kazatel> remove that pls
[10:00:38] <funkt> Have no idea about the selector!
[10:00:47] <duch_kazatel> funkt huh?
[10:01:02] <funkt> I've always used jsfiddle
[10:01:04] <phelix> k its gone
[10:01:10] <phelix> i had it commented out but its just removed now
[10:01:10] <duch_kazatel> funkt i've always preferred jsfiddle.
[10:01:26] <funkt> yeah think ill go back to that to be honest
[10:01:53] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:03:21] <funkt> http://jsfiddle.net/P3AjM/
[10:06:17] <funkt> http://jsfiddle.net/P3AjM/ - Trying to change the div depending on the time of day
[10:11:20] <duch_kazatel> all right, i'm back.
[10:11:36] <duch_kazatel> funkt and again, you have to add jquery/.
[10:11:52] <duch_kazatel> and drop the periods in front of the class names in your .addClass() calls.
[10:12:23] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/P3AjM/1/
[10:12:35] <duch_kazatel> funkt also you were missing the opening line for your js.
[10:12:51] <funkt> your a leg end! thanks so much!
[10:13:01] <duch_kazatel> let me show you how to clean this up.  one sec.
[10:13:11] <funkt> Cheers for being patient with me
[10:13:59] <duch_kazatel> start with something like this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/P3AjM/2/
[10:14:11] <duch_kazatel> descriptive var names are a great thing - use them.
[10:14:18] <funkt> even better!
[10:14:23] <funkt> I will
[10:14:29] <funkt> many thanks!
[10:14:48] <Nomikos> I have some elements that load dynamically, after clicking the name on a list. If they have already loaded before, just show, else, $.get them, then show.
[10:14:52] <BillCriswell> Dammit. Need maps and I'm using libsass lol
[10:14:55] <Nomikos> The showing part has some extra code (update other parts of the page, hide sibling elements, ..) that I don't want to duplicate. Should I be looking at promises to get both get() and already-here in one flow somehow?
[10:15:04] <duch_kazatel> funkt single letter names should be avoided where reasonable.  prepend variables that hold jquery stuff with a dollar sign, too.
[10:15:23] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Ok I found the script causing the error
[10:15:28] <duch_kazatel> !paste Nomikos
[10:15:49] <phelix> but it just happens to be like the most important script. and now causes errors with like every other script
[10:16:00] <duch_kazatel> ph1 what is "the most important script"?
[10:16:07] <phelix> it was the drupal.js
[10:16:08] <duch_kazatel> err, phelix
[10:16:18] <duch_kazatel> phelix link to that one please.
[10:16:22] <phelix> and almost all the other scripts require functions located inside that script so now there are tons of other errors
[10:16:28] <wa5ted> Cork: you around
[10:16:34] <phelix> http://marcwaltersphotography.dev.tributemedia.com/misc/drupal.js
[10:17:01] <wa5ted> remember my problem earlier? is there anyway to get the background image to keep a certain point at the middle of the screen
[10:17:04] <duch_kazatel> phelix can you edit this file at all?
[10:17:12] <phelix> Yea I beleive so
[10:17:20] <duch_kazatel> remove line 5.
[10:17:35] <duch_kazatel> and 4.
[10:18:23] <damnjquery> i have an asp.net mvc application.  i have a jquery modal popup..when you click submit, it calls an action on my controller...the controller returns a filestream (CSV file)...however the modal does dismiss itself...what am i missing?
[10:18:41] <phelix> i commented it out
[10:18:43] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ damnjquery
[10:18:43] <b-ot> damnjquery: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:18:52] <duch_kazatel> phelix the noconflict call?
[10:19:00] <phelix> yes
[10:19:28] <duch_kazatel> and you put everything else back in?
[10:20:17] <damnjquery> well, i'm using asp.net mvc razor....
[10:20:25] <damnjquery> not necesarily all javascript
[10:20:44] <duch_kazatel> damnjquery without seeing your rendered frontend, it's almost impossible to help.
[10:21:10] <Nomikos> what I meant: jsbin.com/vokezuhu/2/edit?js
[10:21:17] <dkphenom> i have a link with some class, I would like to replace the text of the link with some html on resize of the browser window beyond a certain breakpoint, but change it back to original if the viewport is resized again higher than that breakpoint... any idea how to accomplish this?
[10:21:36] <damnjquery> http://fixee.org/paste/eq7qoog/
[10:22:48] <duch_kazatel> damnjquery where'd you get the OnSuccess option from?
[10:23:05] <damnjquery> saw it on a forum, sorry
[10:23:12] <duch_kazatel> damnjquery http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[10:23:36] <duch_kazatel> damnjquery specifically - http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-close
[10:24:36] <damnjquery> i don't think that's going to work
[10:24:41] <phelix> duch_kazatel: ok there we go
[10:24:44] <phelix> and now all is working
[10:24:50] <phelix> It must have been that noconflict function
[10:24:52] <phelix> geez
[10:24:57] <duch_kazatel> phelix that explains a lot.
[10:24:57] <phelix> what a hassle to figure that out .
[10:25:09] <phelix> but thank you soo much for helping me troubleshoot this
[10:25:14] <duch_kazatel> damnjquery huh?  you need to bind that button to close the modal.
[10:25:37] <duch_kazatel> phelix of course.  large, cascading errors like that are usually the result of something small and basic.
[10:25:47] <damnjquery> the input button...ok
[10:26:12] <phelix> yah,  thanks a ton
[10:29:17] <damnjquery> duch, permission to PM
[10:29:54] <drej> denied.
[10:30:19] <duch_kazatel> lol it kind of works against the point of the channel to PM ;)
[10:30:21] <duch_kazatel> just ask here yo.
[10:30:49] <damnjquery> ok..just trying to figure out how to attach that event to the button...onsubmit didn't do the trick
[10:30:57] <duch_kazatel> don't use onsubmit...
[10:31:02] <duch_kazatel> bind it using .on()
[10:31:09] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea where you got onsubmit from,.
[10:34:45] <damnjquery> just .on?  not  onclick, etc?
[10:35:52] <duch_kazatel> have you tried reading the docs at all?
[10:36:00] <duch_kazatel> $()
[10:36:16] <duch_kazatel> $('your-button').on('click', function(){ 1
[10:36:16] <duch_kazatel> 	
[10:36:16] <duch_kazatel> $( ".selector" ).dialog( "close" );});
[10:36:36] <duch_kazatel> $('your-button').on('click', function(){ $( ".selector" ).dialog( "close" ) });
[10:37:07] <duch_kazatel> or, if you need the delegated version $('aContainingElement').on('click', 'theButton', function(){ $( ".selector" ).dialog( "close" ) });
[10:38:20] <damnjquery> i initially had  onclick="closeModal()"  />  and that worked
[10:38:32] <duch_kazatel> don't put code inside your HTML like that.
[10:38:36] <duch_kazatel> that's a bad thing to do.
[10:39:13] <damnjquery> ok..i'm going to try what you suggested
[10:46:36] <damnjquery> jesus..why does this crap have to be so damn hard
[10:47:57] <drej> damnjquery anything is hard if you dont invest time to learn it.
[10:48:02] <drej> reading is fucking hard too, if you dont know any letters
[10:48:35] <damnjquery> i get your point but i don't do this crap everyday...if i threw some iOS code in front of you..i'd like to see if you have the same outlook
[10:48:46] <BillCriswell> drej: Well explained.
[10:50:38] <duch_kazatel> damnjquery why take on a javascript/jquery task if you don't know javascript/jquery?
[10:51:22] <damnjquery> it wasn't my choice
[10:51:28] <drej> damnjquery yeah i wouldnt know anything about ios, so thats why ... i dont code it
[10:51:29] <drej> lol
[10:51:42] <drej> i also dont know anything about car mechanics, so when my shit breaks, i take it to the garage
[10:51:43] <duch_kazatel> damnjquery because if somebody tossed iOS code in front of me, i'd quickly point out "I don't know iOS - you should probably find somebody else to do it."
[10:52:06] <duch_kazatel> and if they didn't listen to me say that, i'
[10:52:16] <duch_kazatel> *i'd raise a big stink.
[10:52:37] <damnjquery> you made your point, and i appreciate you helping me
[10:53:05] <Es0teric> anyone here work with the facebook api?
[10:53:15] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Es0teric
[10:53:16] <b-ot> Es0teric: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:55:07] <Es0teric> well i have oauth_token from facebook and other social media stored inside my mysql database, i already have a url setup to return a json response with the oauth_token that is stored with the social network... my question is -- how do you query the facebook api to see if the user is logged in with the token that is stored... and how would you query the api with the same token to get other information?
[10:55:28] <damnjquery> duch_kazatel...thanks for the help.  i got it working
[10:55:51] <duch_kazatel> damnjquery sure.
[10:56:24] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric i'd go troll the jquery api docs for that one - that's not much of a jquery question.
[10:56:28] <duch_kazatel> *trawl
[10:56:45] <paul_uk> hey all.  anyone know any tutorials on how to best extend javascript ?  i have 1700 lines of code ,which around 95% of it can be base functionality as it were.  i've got 1 page using the code.  but im about to write the other 5 pages where the js only slighly varies.  i want to be able to reference the functions normally but also being able to over
[10:56:45] <paul_uk> load some functions?  OOP isnt my strong point.
[10:56:58] <duch_kazatel> "estend javascript"
[10:57:15] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel where in the api docs?
[10:57:24] <duch_kazatel> paul_k sounds like you're not abstracting very well.
[10:57:35] <paul_uk> duch_kazatel:i'd say you are right.
[10:57:54] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric i'd start here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow/
[10:58:10] <duch_kazatel> paul_k can you paste up some sample code over in a jsfiddle?
[10:58:21] <paul_uk> sure, i'll post a simplied version of what i use.
[10:59:16] <duch_kazatel> paul_k please do not tell me you are generating javascript btw.
[10:59:25] <duch_kazatel> paul_uk i mean
[10:59:41] <paul_uk> generating javascript?  how do you mean?
[11:00:03] <duch_kazatel> you aren't having your backend write out javascript code with unique ids and stuff, right?
[11:00:24] <paul_uk> duch_kazatel: omg.  hell no lol.  who does that?
[11:01:02] <duch_kazatel> paul_uk you'd be surprised...  we had one dude in here doing that for a while.  kept telling him not to.  he got to the end of the project and came in here colpaining about how slow his page was.
[11:01:03] <duch_kazatel> it was funny.
[11:01:32] <paul_uk> im sure it was.  no i have mvc where everything is separated out.
[11:03:56] <paul_uk> duch_kazatel:here is the framework of the js that i use.  bear in mind, i have a single webpage application.  i only have 1 full pageload on init, its total ajax after that.  http://pastie.org/private/uekw65mmhyswnduzqcxqva
[11:04:41] <duch_kazatel> paul_uk you said this is a "simplified version" - could you make a more complet4e example on jsfiddle?
[11:07:03] <haemly> Was wondering if anybody know what may be going wrong with my situation. So basically, I have an SVG on a webpage, however everytime I append a new path (with a different stroke color) the colors override each other. So all of the path colors will be the color of the last path
[11:08:34] <paul_uk> duch_kazatel:here is one with more code.  http://pastie.org/private/wu77qjocrwfze7fmmcwp7a   pretty much what i do, is segregate everything into its own functions.    so a checkbox, input, select all have their own functions as they are doing a unique job.
[11:09:17] <paul_uk> with respect to the 6 pages i have.  they all have the same functionality, yet for some functions.  they will do 1 page will need more functionality than another.  but still use the same other functions.
[11:09:49] <paul_uk> so i want to be able to hit 1 function but have available more methods on demand.
[11:10:23] <duch_kazatel> paul_uk i'm lost - why are you using constructors for this?
[11:10:55] <CrowX-> how do I check if an element exists? Would this work? "if($(selector))?
[11:11:06] <BillCriswell> CrowX-: No.
[11:11:08] <BillCriswell> Have to check the length.
[11:11:10] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- check the length of the selector - $(selector).length
[11:11:21] <BillCriswell> Meowsers.
[11:12:33] <duch_kazatel> paul_uk it looks like most of what you're doing doesn't reeally require much more than some event bindings, so i can't see why you's span new objects and whatnot.
[11:12:33] <paul_uk> duch_kazatel: i guess i saw this pattern being used and it is very useful when using callbacks as well.  it just stuck as the default pattern i use for everything i do.
[11:13:18] <paul_uk> duch_kazatel:well the biggest reason i do this.  like i said before.  i have a single webpage application.  when the js is loaded, i force a new object to be loaded and available to the browser.
[11:13:24] <ankurk_> okay this might be a stupid question, how much is too much jQuery?
[11:13:24] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, so if an element by id "#something" doesn't exit, I could use "if($("#something").length > 0) to check if the element exists?
[11:13:33] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ define "too much"
[11:13:44] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- if($("#something").length){}
[11:13:49] <duch_kazatel> err, if($("#something")).length
[11:14:04] <ankurk_> you can say a *lot* of jquery code
[11:14:17] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- 0 is falsy.
[11:14:21] <CrowX-> i see
[11:14:26] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ that's a really vague question.
[11:14:53] <ankurk_> well, basically I want to know how much lines of JS a browser can handle?
[11:14:57] <duch_kazatel> paul_uk so you're creating a new object every time the ajax runs?  or what?
[11:15:13] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ that kind of question is worrying.  how about you explain what you're doing
[11:15:34] <CrowX-> how do I execute a function at once, but individually on every element by the name of its class?
[11:15:45] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- huh?
[11:15:54] <paul_uk> duch_kazatel:no, everytime a new page is requested by the user.  if they are in profiles and then they navigate to home.  it will request the home js if its not already existing in header but also create a new instance of home to force it to be existing.
[11:16:24] <duch_kazatel> paul_uk either way, you'll need to setup some basic handling to check which page they're on and handle the execution from there.
[11:16:26] <ankurk_> well, I am working on a part of a module, I have written almost 700 lines of code. But my boss says that is too much for a browser to handle, especially on OSes like Windows 2000
[11:16:35] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, I have several images whose class is ".images". Is there a way I could pass them all as arguments in a function that will execute against every one of the elements separately?
[11:16:41] <paul_uk> duch_kazatel:yeah im already doing that now.  thats not really the issue i have tho
[11:16:52] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- paste the code up on jsfiddle please.
[11:16:58] <decx> that's ridiculous ankurk_
[11:16:59] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, I have a window.resize function that's supposed to resize them to fit the screen
[11:17:01] <paul_uk> ankurk_: i have 1js file which has 4000 lines of code lol.
[11:17:20] <decx> lines doesn't mean squat
[11:17:21] <paul_uk> ankurk_:nevermind all the library files i am loading in also to suppliment the page
[11:17:21] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ that is a fallacious argument.  smaller files are a good thing, but 700 is not a limit.
[11:17:37] <CrowX-> $(window).resize event actually
[11:17:44] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- please fiddle your code.
[11:17:46] <decx> i can crash a browser with one line of radial gradient manipulation ankurk_ ;)
[11:18:47] <paul_uk> ankurk_: are you coding for IE 6 or what lol
[11:19:30] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ it sounds like your boss is just trying to encourage smaller files overall.  1000+ lines in one file is sometimes seen as excessive, depending on where you are and what the file is supposed to be doing.
[11:19:36] <decx> his boss is just strange from what i can tell paul_k
[11:19:44] <ankurk_> that is ridiculous too I think, but my boss has me thinking
[11:19:58] <ankurk_> I can think minifying the file to reduce the load
[11:20:00] <ankurk_> *of
[11:20:17] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ make sure you're abstracting where appropriate.  does your company have an internally maintained utils file kicking around?
[11:20:29] <decx> unless you'Re serving a few hundred requests per minute minifying doesn't really matter
[11:20:48] <decx> it's a good practise, but overrated for most stuff
[11:20:58] <paul_uk> decx: im doing a few thousands per second hehe.  minifying is definitely the way to go also :)
[11:21:12] <decx> of course in high traffic situations it's useful
[11:21:14] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel, well I don't know. Funny thing is we don't even push our code, we just copy paste the stuff
[11:21:22] <paul_uk> but im also using varnish at the front-end also
[11:21:22] <ankurk_> to live server
[11:21:27] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ O.O
[11:21:29] <decx> but not on a page that has a few thousand uniques per day
[11:21:31] <decx> ;D
[11:21:51] <ankurk_> that was my reaction too
[11:21:58] <duch_kazatel> i'd start running.
[11:22:01] <duch_kazatel> that sounds terrifying.
[11:22:20] <ankurk_> And since it's an internal system for the company, I don't think that should matter
[11:23:06] <decx> unless you're going spartan 700 lines is nothing, if that'S a problem then jquery would be a nono anyway
[11:23:53] <duch_kazatel> yeah i don't get the 700 lines argument, unless each line is like a thousand chars wide.
[11:24:17] <decx> even then it could just be long strings,
[11:24:28] <paul_uk> ankurk_:what browser are you targetting ?
[11:27:09] <ankurk_> well, just firefox & chrome
[11:27:23] <duch_kazatel> then why are they worried about windows 2000?
[11:27:28] <paul_uk> if thats the case, you should have no problems.
[11:27:57] <ankurk_> because he think 2000 based browser can't handle a *lot* of JS
[11:28:01] <ankurk_> *thinks
[11:28:38] <paul_uk> sounds like a case of the dumb boss.  ahh, i remember those days with fondness.... not
[11:28:47] <duch_kazatel> do what i'd do - ask for where he found that info.
[11:29:00] <paul_uk> probably his next door neighbour
[11:29:07] <duch_kazatel> i had one dude here say "well since IE11 is based on opera, blah blah blah"
[11:29:17] <duch_kazatel> i was like "huh?  where'd you hear that?"
[11:29:17] <paul_uk> lmao
[11:29:19] <duch_kazatel> etc
[11:29:24] <ankurk_> he does stuff though
[11:29:35] <paul_uk> what stuff
[11:29:44] <ankurk_> *know
[11:30:07] <duch_kazatel> any time you say something like "windows 2000 has issues with javascript files over 700 lines", you need to be able to explain why.
[11:30:09] <paul_uk> i think everyone knows stuff to a degree.  whether its accurate or true is another thing
[11:30:10] <ankurk_> but one time he said, w3schools is affiliated to w3c
[11:30:22] <ankurk_> I was like -_-
[11:30:27] <paul_uk> look up w3fools lol
[11:30:36] <duch_kazatel> !w3fools
[11:30:44] <duch_kazatel> awww our bot is missing that one.
[11:31:42] <ankurk_> I would tell him this someday
[11:31:52] <ankurk_> but I don't wanna sound arrogant :
[11:31:53] <ankurk_> :P
[11:32:04] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ either way, i would've asked why.  Like, totally innocently "Oh, really?  That's weird, I've never heard of that.  Why?"
[11:32:12] <decx> when you land a job after your internshit, "BTW YOU SUCK BRO"
[11:32:46] <decx> now that's a nice typo right there
[11:32:46] <duch_kazatel> and make sure you work somewhere that is cool with you being like "prove it".
[11:32:58] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha i thought you typed that on purpose
[11:32:58] <decx> don't even need to correct that one
[11:33:29] <decx> well p isn't close to t it was a freudian slip i guess
[11:33:39] <duch_kazatel> prolly
[11:36:37] <decx> 613.000 visitors with windows on one of my pages, 25 windows 2000, 4 windows 98
[11:36:53] <ankurk_> but no matter, it's been a different kind of experience :P
[11:36:59] <_biff> hi
[11:37:06] <ankurk_> who uses Windows 2000 nowadays? o.O
[11:37:14] <_biff> is there any post size limit in .ajax? as text
[11:37:19] <decx> 25 out of 613000 i guess ;)
[11:38:49] <duch_kazatel> _biff that'd be dictated by the server and browser i'd assume.
[11:40:12] <decx> man who didnt die this weekend? mickey rooney, peaches geldof, the streak
[11:40:22] <_biff> duch_kazatel in other words, what if i want to transfer base data thru ajax
[11:40:31] <duch_kazatel> _biff huh?  base data?
[11:40:33] <_biff> bas64
[11:40:41] <_biff> szo animage for example
[11:40:47] <_biff> *so
[11:40:48] <duch_kazatel> how big?
[11:41:06] <_biff> how much could be:)
[11:41:15] <_biff> these are png-s
[11:41:19] <duch_kazatel> that's a loaded question.  lots of variables there.
[11:41:21] <_biff> qrcode png-s..
[11:41:43] <paul_uk> ah well looks like i solved my issue and simply using this = $.extend(object);
[11:42:14] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax() is an abstraction of the XMLHttpRequest object, and HTTP doesn't have any limitations on that per se, _biff
[11:42:32] <_biff> duch_kazatel okbut  i could save one, but others i couldnt, therefor i think there is some length limit of the post size
[11:42:41] <duch_kazatel> you'll need to look at your server
[11:42:48] <duch_kazatel> because there is no browser limit.
[11:42:56] <duch_kazatel> you'll have timeouts to juggle, too.
[11:43:38] <_biff> interresting...
[11:44:21] <duch_kazatel> _biff why are these images so big?  if they're just QR codes, you could use almost any other format with huge, lossy compression applied and be fine.
[11:46:06] <decx> can't qr codes be translated to base64 without having to base64 a png?`
[11:46:20] <decx> like just base64 the string
[11:46:36] <decx> and then create your image from that clientside
[11:46:57] <duch_kazatel> you could do all kinds of things.
[11:47:07] <duch_kazatel> but a QR code in PNG is overkill.
[11:47:40] <decx> i doubt you gain anything by going gif
[11:47:45] <decx> ^^
[11:48:20] <duch_kazatel> hrm?  you'll probably save on filesize a little.
[11:48:36] <duch_kazatel> also: http://picturesofpeoplescanningqrcodes.tumblr.com/
[11:48:49] <decx> overhead is the same
[11:48:54] <duch_kazatel> fair enough
[11:49:09] <decx> i actually fell in love with lossy png
[11:49:22] <decx> greatness
[11:49:49] <_biff> duch_kazatel i dont think that these are so big...
[11:50:16] <duch_kazatel> you might need to look at your server and figure it out.
[11:50:22] <_biff> decx i created these on clientside in the browser
[11:50:30] <_biff> but i wanted to save to server
[11:50:38] <_biff> so i would use php of course
[11:50:52] <duch_kazatel> "so i would use php of course"
[11:51:04] <_biff> on png are save...the first..but the second for example isnt saved...
[11:51:17] <_biff> *one png is saved

[12:03:53] <jftf> I'm looking to strip out a parent from a bunch of HTML data
[12:04:02] <jftf> trim doesn't do it
[12:04:05] <jftf> i tried empty()
[12:04:19] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ jftf
[12:04:19] <b-ot> jftf: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:04:30] <jftf> ok
[12:04:39] <decx> data = data.find('parent').html() :>
[12:05:33] <jftf> decx, yeah I thought of that but I would need to add a parent to this particular div
[12:05:50] <decx> i thought you want to get rid of the parent
[12:05:56] <duch_kazatel> "strip out a parent from a bunch of HTML data"
[12:05:59] <duch_kazatel> that's where i'
[12:06:01] <jftf> well after it's already in data
[12:06:05] <duch_kazatel> *i'm lost - that doesn't mean anything.
[12:06:11] <jftf> i can paste hold on
[12:06:13] <duch_kazatel> 'swhy i asked for a fiddle.
[12:12:23] <wa5ted> hey
[12:12:24] <wa5ted> guys
[12:12:28] <wa5ted> got an interesting question
[12:12:31] <wa5ted> is there anyway
[12:12:42] <wa5ted> or a script to take screenshots of a map area
[12:12:48] <wa5ted> like for example
[12:13:36] <wa5ted> if i give the script go give me a 5000*5000 pixel area around (x,y) point at zoom level 1.5x on google maps
[12:13:44] <wa5ted> anything like that
[12:14:01] <wa5ted> and that 5000 * 5000 area would be outputted in image format
[12:14:28] <MikeD_> isn't that what google maps IS ?
[12:14:42] <wa5ted> well yes
[12:14:44] <wa5ted> true
[12:14:46] <decx> that would be against the tos
[12:14:48] <wa5ted> but i want a static image
[12:15:00] <wa5ted> for use in a small demo
[12:15:07] <wa5ted> or not google maps
[12:15:13] <wa5ted> but any similar mapping program
[12:15:27] <wa5ted> like openstreetmap.org
[12:16:16] <decx> well you can use teh osm data directly to create your static image
[12:17:12] <wa5ted> decx what do you mean by that
[12:17:25] <_cjm> Hi Folks, I am building a <div> to mask another <div>, mostly to intercept clicks, and I need this masking <div> to be the first child of its parent.  $(parent).append(mask) does exactly as expected.  How to I specify insert as first child?
[12:17:34] <wa5ted> cause i know i can manually screen capture and and stich together the image i need
[12:17:46] <wa5ted> but if there is a script out tthere i rather use that
[12:17:55] <decx> go to openstreetmap.org click share export png
[12:19:19] <decx> _cjm prepend
[12:19:29] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery insert div as first child
[12:19:31] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .prepend() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[12:19:36] <duch_kazatel> >:D
[12:20:18] <decx> if everybody only used google then this channel would be dead though :>
[12:20:25] <duch_kazatel> prolly.
[12:20:49] <ankurk_> everyone knows how to google, but they are lazy
[12:20:50] <duch_kazatel> i think i'm going to start enforcing a rule of google - if I can successfully google the answer via the bot, i will not answer the question.
[12:21:19] <duch_kazatel> shit now i have to figure out lunch.
[12:21:33] <decx> had a curry kebab today
[12:21:42] <wa5ted> decx: sure i could do that but how much of an image would it capture
[12:22:05] <decx> you can specify the zoom and get anything from 160x50 to 2500x1500
[12:22:12] <decx> or something
[12:23:34] <_cjm> decx, duch_kazatel b-ot Thanks.
[12:23:48] <duch_kazatel> _cjm b-ot isn't a person btw.
[12:24:08] <_cjm> decx, duch_kazatel it wasn't a question of being lazy, but of expecting an answer that was much more complicated.
[12:24:18] <technosexual> Hmm... so I need some kind of notification... thing of some sort.
[12:24:31] <decx> yeah it's the jquery way, where the solution is shorter than the question
[12:24:38] <duch_kazatel> almost always.
[12:24:54] <_cjm> duch_kazatel, Yes.  I know.  I was being facetious because b-ot actually answered the question... (-:
[12:25:52] <technosexual> I'm going to be receiving these notifications over a socket.
[12:25:57] <technosexual> I'm using socket.io by the way.
[12:26:05] <technosexual> socket.io + node.js
[12:26:52] <technosexual> So I'll be receiving these notifications from the server, and so I was thinking of just appending the notification message to a notification <section>
[12:27:35] <technosexual> Unless there's a better way.
[12:27:49] <technosexual> Or something with more zazz.
[12:28:44] <technosexual> I'm sure jQuery provides plenty of zazzy options.
[12:30:16] <Jon471> razzle dazzle
[12:30:54] <technosexual> yes, you know what I'm talking about.
[12:33:18] <krambiorix> is there some kind of way that i can see which function triggers a handler or to keep track of what's happening?
[12:35:46] <_cjm> Hi Folks, how do I specify css properties that have a hyphen in the name?  JavaScript thinks this is a syntax error...
[12:36:07] <duch_kazatel> _cjm .css('property-name', 'value')
[12:36:19] <_cjm> duch_kazatel, Oh!  That can be a string?
[12:36:25] <duch_kazatel> _cjm yep.
[12:36:31] <_cjm> duch_kazatel, Thanks.
[12:36:43] <duch_kazatel> depending on how much manipulation you're doing, consider adding/removing classes instead.
[12:38:16] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:42:03] <duch_kazatel> technosexual jquery won't really have anything built-in to handle that.  you'd have to build it out.
[12:42:39] <schrapel> What's the best way to put the errors from a ajax request into a html ul/li list? https://www.dropbox.com/s/7c5t8s2h2r76jan/Screenshot%202014-04-07%2020.42.31.png
[12:43:07] <duch_kazatel> schrapel by using .append() and parsing your data.
[12:44:55] <schrapel> best way to parse the data? sorry for the stupid questions, but i'm not a js dev
[12:45:30] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean.  enumerate through your arrays and get your data.  do you have control over the server sending that data?
[12:45:41] <duch_kazatel> because that format doesn't really make sense.
[12:47:01] <schrapel> it's sent by rails, pretty sure i can't change it
[12:47:09] <duch_kazatel> schrapel you can't change the format?
[12:47:32] <duch_kazatel> either way, copy/paste the data into a new jsfiddle
[12:49:11] <Andre-B> is there a way to get the current jquery dom state? is there an internal variable that logs on which state of processing it was last?
[12:49:20] <duch_kazatel> "jquery dom state"?
[12:49:29] <duch_kazatel> that question makes no sense.
[12:49:34] <duch_kazatel> explain what you're trying to accomplish.
[12:49:37] <Andre-B> somehow jQuery(function() {}); is not triggered, and I cant tell why it’s not calling
[12:49:49] <BillCriswell> Andre-B: Any errors in the console?
[12:50:00] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Andre-B
[12:50:00] <b-ot> Andre-B: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:50:27] <schrapel> duch_kazatel: in what format?
[12:50:40] <Andre-B> it’s not a simple html and js file to post, would have done, a rather huge drupal installion that suddenly fails to trigger.
[12:50:56] <Andre-B> BillCriswell: there’s an unrelated error with a missing property check
[12:51:01] <duch_kazatel> schrapel ... your data getting sent to the browser.
[12:51:07] <duch_kazatel> Andre-B those errors are sometimes related.
[12:51:32] <duch_kazatel> Andre-B and we don't care about your backend, only your frontend.  setting up a small, simple test case is useful and helpful.
[12:51:43] <BillCriswell> Yeah. Remove the code generating that error and see if it works.
[12:51:56] <schrapel> But I mean do I need to convert it to a json or something first? If I just copy and paste to jsfiddle it won't maintain the structure
[12:52:07] <BillCriswell> Going to see a talk on the building of the new TED site that's in progress. Should be interesting.
[12:52:56] <duch_kazatel> schrapel ... what else would you send?
[12:53:10] <duch_kazatel> schrapel the response from your server should all ready be "json"
[12:53:45] <duch_kazatel> schrapel i would suggest learning some basics, because that'll server you very well in this case.
[12:54:37] <hlvwrk> SUP YO
[12:56:35] <decx> please stop with the 'all ready' duch_kazatel i always get a little gag reflex when i read that from you
[12:57:06] <duch_kazatel> :(
[12:57:29] <duch_kazatel> that's one of those things i've always gotten wrong.
[12:57:49] <decx> well not anymore, from now on
[12:57:53] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[12:59:04] <duch_kazatel> i know the feeling though - i know one person who puts a comma before and after the word "but" ALL THE TIME - "i know it's nothing new, but, blah blah blah"
[12:59:41] <decx> i still always forget the dots for the umlauts when handwriting
[12:59:50] <decx> "eh i'm gonna put them after the sentence"
[13:00:27] <duch_kazatel> i can't think of the last time i needed umlauts when writing by hand.
[13:00:41] <duch_kazatel> brb lunch
[13:05:35] <Andre-B> error was related..
[13:05:41] <Andre-B> good to know
[13:23:15] <Abbbbbbhi> Hi
[13:24:17] <jdo_dk> Cant .on() be used on ajax loaded content ? $("#ajax_content").on("click", ".objects", function....
[13:24:39] <Abbbbbbhi> Do I need to make any other chnages in order to use Font Awesome icons - http://jsfiddle.net/9wB9m/?
[13:25:21] <duch_kazatel> jdo_dk the first part has to be something that exists on the page all ready.
[13:25:35] <duch_kazatel> you can only bind to something that exists at the time of binding.
[13:25:52] <jdo_dk> duch_kazatel: Just what i throught. Thanks.
[13:25:58] <b1nd> Does .attr('width') return the correct value very time?
[13:26:12] <duch_kazatel> b1nd if there is a width attribute, yes.
[13:26:24] <b1nd> basically I have an element $("#foo").attr('width'); and it is not returning the inline width that I set
[13:26:28] <jdo_dk> But can i use a more specific selector later on ? "click", "#ajax_content .objects", func... ?
[13:26:38] <b1nd> it is returning the width from css
[13:27:00] <duch_kazatel> b1nd huh?  why not use .width() ?
[13:27:18] <duch_kazatel> jdo_dk yeah.  check out the docs - you can feed any selector into that second arg.
[13:27:22] <jdo_dk> Abbbbbbhi: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/ dont you miss the directory font-awesome ?
[13:27:46] <jdo_dk> duch_kazatel: Just tried, but i must be missing something. Thanks again.
[13:27:55] <b1nd> no i don't want the actual width  from .width but in this case .attr('width') is return same thing
[13:28:10] <b1nd> I have <img width="1000px" id="foo" />
[13:28:19] <b1nd> then I have some css with max-width
[13:28:28] <duch_kazatel> b1nd fiddle it please.
[13:28:37] <b1nd> if I call $("#foo").attr('width'); I get 320px
[13:32:18] <b1nd> http://jsfiddle.net/GJZQz/6
[13:33:13] <b1nd> hm
[13:33:16] <duch_kazatel> b1nd that has nothing to do with your question.
[13:33:19] <b1nd> do i need account to do this?
[13:33:27] <b1nd> ya i just clicked share button
[13:33:32] <duch_kazatel> hit "update"
[13:33:36] <b1nd> okay sec
[13:33:43] <duch_kazatel> then copy/paste the link.
[13:34:02] <b1nd> http://jsfiddle.net/GJZQz/7/
[13:34:10] <pcfreak30> Has anyone ever gotten a jq mobile issue with a refresh look causing nested divs or a nested button..
[13:34:18] <pcfreak30> link*
[13:34:19] <b1nd> okay works
[13:34:35] <b1nd> now see what I mean?
[13:34:50] <pcfreak30> i mean loop
[13:34:51] <duch_kazatel> b1nd what value are you expecting to get?
[13:35:15] <b1nd> 628 each time
[13:35:25] <b1nd> no matter what size that image is in the browser
[13:35:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/GJZQz/8/
[13:36:27] <b1nd> hmmm
[13:36:32] <b1nd> works,
[13:36:33] <b1nd> why?
[13:36:39] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:36:43] <b1nd> how do i `diff` jFiddles?
[13:36:56] <duch_kazatel> you don't.  show me one that wasn't working.
[13:37:05] <b1nd> http://jsfiddle.net/GJZQz/7/
[13:37:22] <duch_kazatel> .width() and .attr('width') are two different things.
[13:37:42] <b1nd> yes yes one moment
[13:37:45] <duch_kazatel> the first one returns a calculated width.  the second returns the value of the width attribute.
[13:37:52] <b1nd> yes but
[13:37:58] <b1nd> okay one moment
[13:41:11] <decx> til width: auto overrides the width attribute
[13:41:25] <b1nd> hm?
[13:41:27] <duch_kazatel> bwuh?  not for me.
[13:41:33] <decx> today i learned*
[13:41:37] <b1nd> ya it auto overrides it?
[13:41:47] <b1nd> i was thinking about this, how can it happen
[13:42:01] <duch_kazatel> oh you mean, the css value overrides the attribute value, not the return.
[13:42:07] <b1nd> yes
[13:42:12] <b1nd> both
[13:42:20] <decx> the auto width gets the image size and css overrides legacy size attributes
[13:42:20] <b1nd> overrides both
[13:42:33] <decx> like width= and height=
[13:42:34] <duch_kazatel> .width() returns the calculated with.
[13:42:44] <duch_kazatel> .attr('width') returns the value of the width attribute still.
[13:43:00] <b1nd> .attr('width') might also return the calculated width
[13:43:03] <duch_kazatel> and width: auto; in your css overrides the behavior of the width attribute in your markup.
[13:43:05] <duch_kazatel> it does not for me.
[13:43:46] <duch_kazatel> I'm still getting 628 in my console for http://jsfiddle.net/GJZQz/8/
[13:43:56] <b1nd> maybe it overrides for be because i am also using => usemap="#mymap"
[13:44:13] <duch_kazatel> hrm?  a fiddle showing what you're doing would be helpful.
[13:44:20] <b1nd> ok
[13:44:22] <b1nd> wait
[13:54:31] <duch_kazatel> so i have a need to start playing bocce ball apparently because i am now an old italian man.

[14:08:59] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: You accidentally paste more shit than I do on purpose.
[14:09:06] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[14:10:09] <BillCriswell> It's raining. I hate this shit.
[14:10:24] <BillCriswell> Wanted to go to a talk for Philly Tech Week now I'll need to go in with wet shoes on.
[14:12:35] <BillCriswell> Would it be weird to walk around barefoot?
[14:12:43] <duch_kazatel> you hippy.
[14:13:30] <decx> are your shoes made from silk or what
[14:13:50] <BillCriswell> No. It's not the life of the shoes I'm worried about, it's the wetness of the socks.
[14:14:24] <decx> that's easy, go sockless
[14:14:59] <decx> i'm sure the odore of a tech talk environment won't be negatively influenced by your stinky feet
[14:15:19] <BillCriswell> I think the place I'm going to is kind of fancy though.
[14:17:40] <duch_kazatel> you obviously haven't met many true silicon valley nerds.
[14:17:54] <decx> yeah tech fancy still don't care
[14:18:04] <BillCriswell> Ok fine I'll make the place stink.
[14:18:04] <duch_kazatel> shit, they do that on purpose.
[14:18:08] <decx> only after you introduce the corporate element things start to go suit
[14:18:22] <duch_kazatel> nah they fight against the corporate thing as much as possible.
[14:18:25] <BillCriswell> I wonder if there will be free food and or beer.
[14:19:16] <duch_kazatel> help i'm watching bocce ball championship videos now i think i have a problem.
[14:19:40] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Are there people that are really skilled at that?
[14:19:46] <duch_kazatel> yes
[14:19:54] <BillCriswell> ... Do they have trick shots?
[14:19:57] <duch_kazatel> i'm kind of blown away now.  and yes.
[14:20:03] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[14:20:08] <duch_kazatel> because you can push the palino around and stuff.
[14:20:21] <duch_kazatel> err, pallino maybe?
[14:20:25] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ah, good point.
[14:20:31] <BillCriswell> I know what you mean, not sure how to spell it.
[14:20:31] <duch_kazatel> and other balls.
[14:20:51] <BillCriswell> When I watch billiard players I get really sucked in.
[14:20:55] <BillCriswell> Can't even watch one video.
[14:21:08] <duch_kazatel> i used to be into billiards.
[14:21:56] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I love the sport.
[14:22:17] <BillCriswell> Don't play nearly as much as I used to but I still have some trick shots that win me money.
[14:23:36] <decx> my father had a table in the basement. everytime i'm in a bar with a table i don't have to pay for drinks
[14:24:10] <decx> unless i encounter a real player, then it's bleeding time for me ^^
[14:24:24] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha same.
[14:24:26] <duch_kazatel> we had one that came with a house when i was a teenager.  the felt was destroyed.  still a lot of fun though.
[14:24:32] <BillCriswell> I am very impressive in a usual crowd.
[14:24:34] <duch_kazatel> never did get very good though.
[14:25:30] <decx> yeah if you can set up the next shot even somewhat you will obliterate any casuals
[14:25:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Exactly.
[14:25:59] <BillCriswell> I wish more casuals played 9 ball so their balls wouldn't get in my way.
[14:34:54] <CrowX-> if an element has 2 classes, and I want to change one of them, do I change it like this? $(element).attr('class', 'newClass oldClassThatIDontWannaChange')
[14:38:18] <decx> you might want to use removeClass and addClass instead
[14:41:13] <duch_kazatel> do what decx said.
[15:23:32] <parallel21> just $('a') or $('div') only returns one element
[15:23:47] <parallel21> Where as on some pages it returns all instances of that element
[15:24:53] <parallel21> That is to say, other webpages using jquery, the command returns more than one instance.
[15:28:01] <duch_kazatel> parallel21 that is normal
[15:28:12] <duch_kazatel> it should return all instances of an element.
[15:28:48] <parallel21> Awesome, so why could it be returning all only instance?
[15:28:58] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:29:21] <parallel21> When I run the command, it returns the html of the first instance of that element.
[15:29:31] <parallel21> $('a') will return only a single link
[15:29:34] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see it in action.
[15:29:42] <parallel21> one sec
[15:29:50] <duch_kazatel> but that will return all <a> on the page.
[15:29:58] <duch_kazatel> please paste in jsfiddle :)
[15:32:57] <duch_kazatel> i wonder how many people are aware their client is joining before the cloak applies.
[15:35:45] <parallel21> Bah
[15:36:30] <parallel21> my brain was working. jQuery wasn't loading
[15:36:35] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[15:36:38] <duch_kazatel> that explains a ;lot.
[15:36:40] <parallel21> *was not
[15:37:10] <parallel21> Chrome was loading jQuery for a external plugin so I keep thinking it was loading
[15:37:17] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:37:24] <duch_kazatel> what plugin?
[16:24:44] <Ohga> hello, I have a problem using a "resizable" from jq-ui on a textarea such that its label is properly verticaly aligned to the middle
[16:27:41] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Ohga
[16:27:41] <b-ot> Ohga: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:27:59] <Ohga> yepp, working on it
[16:36:50] <Ohga> I think this is the relevant parts: http://jsfiddle.net/5WV8e/
[16:37:31] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:37:40] <duch_kazatel> i see a bunch of css in there.  no javascript or jquery.
[16:37:47] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/5WV8e/2/
[16:38:25] <Ohga> yeah, fiddled with the wrong box.. stupid me
[16:39:13] <duch_kazatel> soooo are you asking about jquery?  or css?
[16:39:33] <Ohga> but as you can see, in version 2 the label seem to be aligned with the bottom, not the middle
[16:40:24] <Ohga> well.. it works alright for any other web form control, so what is it that jq-ui mess up, and what to do about it?
[16:40:34] <duch_kazatel> you know you can include jqueryui, right?
[16:40:45] <Ohga> ?
[16:40:58] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/5WV8e/3/
[16:41:00] <duch_kazatel> upper left.
[16:41:59] <Ohga> oh I see
[16:42:26] <Ohga> however, no difference to where the label is positioned..
[16:42:58] <Ohga> wait.. got to add the actual javascript code.. give me a moment
[16:43:08] <Ohga> not used jsfiddle that much..
[16:43:28] <Ally_devbox> hi I m new on Qunit, is that anyone i can ask about Qunit? thanks
[16:44:39] <Ohga> http://jsfiddle.net/5WV8e/4/
[16:45:05] <duch_kazatel> Ohga so what are you trying to do?
[16:45:21] <Ohga> there, and now it seems we got the even earlier problem of getting the textarea rendered as a block
[16:45:50] <Ohga> label, 200px wide, text area to the right of it. label should be verticaly aligned at middle compared to textarea
[16:47:38] <obert> Ohga: label got only one line of text?
[16:47:50] <Ohga> yeah..
[16:48:07] <obert> you can try line-height to center it vertically then
[16:48:22] <obert> just css
[16:48:43] <Ohga> and what happens when the textarea is resized?
[16:49:11] <obert> use media queries to fix it?
[16:49:35] <Ohga> can you provide an example?
[16:50:17] <obert> no
[16:50:45] <obert> i only told you that you can center vertically one line of text using only css
[16:50:52] <obert> else use js
[16:51:15] <obert> css3 media queries and line-height == css, else js
[16:51:23] <Ohga> ok...
[16:52:03] <obert> i hope to fall asleep as early as possible
[16:52:15] <Ohga> the central issue however, is why adding resizablility to a textarea breaks layout and vertical alignment, such as in my jsfiddle
[16:52:41] <duch_kazatel> Ohga it might be pertient to point out that you'll probably need to apply floats to fix it.  the issue is that jqueryui has to add a div around the textarea to to what you want.
[16:53:25] <Ohga> duch_kazatel: yeah. so we're talking about floating the .ui-wrapper div?
[16:54:30] <decx> resizable on a textarea?
[16:54:47] <decx> but it's already resizable!?
[16:55:03] <Ohga> decx: not in IE
[16:55:31] <decx> and it's that vital?
[16:55:44] <duch_kazatel> Ohga you're going to have almost endless headaches btw.
[16:56:05] <Ohga> decx: what is?
[16:56:19] <Ohga> duch_kazatel: already feeling it, yay
[17:00:54] <decx> btw don't use // for comments in css
[17:05:45] <obert> Ohga: i dunno jquery ui, but in css, if you want to manage all screen res, you need to learn CSS3 media queries. if i don't understood the question
[17:06:47] <Ohga> obert: sure, but for this problem I just need to manage layout to begin with.. so I don't see what media queries have to do with this..
[17:07:17] <obert> Ohga: because you talked about resizable things
[17:07:48] <Ohga> I meant the jquery-ui resizable feature
[17:07:50] <duch_kazatel> obert media queries are more for managing screen width.
[17:08:17] <obert> eh misunderstood then, sorry
[17:09:41] <vxitch> i want to have jquery's ajaxSend() create an object that is destroyed by the same ajax request's ajaxComplete(). any idea what the best way to do this is? can i pass a reference to the object around these two? if not, is there an accessible unique ID of each ajax request I can embed in the object on creation so I can find it later to destroy
[17:10:01] <Ohga> here with proper comment syntax: http://jsfiddle.net/5WV8e/9/
[17:11:56] <duch_kazatel> vxitch how do you expect to destroy the object?
[17:12:51] <vxitch> .remove()
[17:12:51] <b-ot> vxitch: firing because .slideUp() is already executed, though it is still animating
[17:13:44] <duch_kazatel> vxitch that doesn't "destrow an object", but it does remove it from the dom.\
[17:13:53] <duch_kazatel> so you're creating an element and want to destroy it later?
[17:14:35] <vxitch> yeah, that's really what i want. remove it from the dom. i can keep it in memory and add it to the dom on every ajaxSend()
[17:15:05] <duch_kazatel> vxitch could you clarify the greater picture?
[17:15:15] <duch_kazatel> like, is this for a progress modal of some kjind?
[17:15:17] <duch_kazatel> *kind
[17:15:51] <vxitch> i have a lot of buttons on an interface that act independently, i want a loading indicator of some kind on each of them when they're activated
[17:15:55] <Ohga> right, so setting an explicit vertical-align: middle on .ui-wrapper makes everything play right.
[17:16:01] <vxitch> and when each request finishes i want the indicator to go away
[17:16:21] <duch_kazatel> vxitch aaaah.  you're going to have to do some manual work there I'm afraid.
[17:16:26] <Ohga> related question: why does jq-ui resizable add a padding-bottom to the .ui-wrapper div?
[17:16:32] <vxitch> and i'd rather not have to do this in every single $.ajax() with deferred methods
[17:16:48] <duch_kazatel> vxitch i'm not familiar with any way to pass around arbitrary data like that.
[17:17:10] <vxitch> alright, hmm, is there a way i can embed a unique ajax ID to each request?
[17:17:24] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't do that personally.
[17:17:44] <duch_kazatel> because then you'll have to figure out how to get that up to an appropriate shared scope.
[17:17:52] <vxitch> i know by default ajax already has this functionality. but i cant find any unique id to access in the objects passed to ajaxSend()/ajaxComplete()
[17:18:02] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[17:18:24] <CrowX-> vxitch, make the id a variable, and append an incrementing number to it
[17:18:40] <LinksEz> Hi.
[17:18:56] <LinksEz> Is there a way to put an event listener on an ID/Class and not an element?
[17:19:05] <duch_kazatel> LinksEz yes.
[17:19:10] <LinksEz> >.>
[17:19:22] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- if there are going to be simultaneous requests, that falls apart pretty quickly.
[17:19:43] <duch_kazatel> LinksEz let me guess - you're loading in content after the page loads and you have listeners that aren't working?
[17:20:01] <CrowX-> Linkeh, $('.className').proceed-with-the-event-here:)
[17:20:12] <LinksEz> Was actually switching the classes of said element.
[17:20:14] <LinksEz> >.>
[17:20:24] <duch_kazatel> LinksEz use event delegation in that case instead.
[17:20:41] <duch_kazatel> LinksEz $('parent').on('click', '.classname', function(){});
[17:21:00] <duch_kazatel> where 'parent' is something that exists at time of binding that is an ancestor of the element you want to activate on.
[17:22:04] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, what's the difference between "$(selector).on('click', function()"  and $(selector).click(function ()"
[17:22:08] <duch_kazatel> vxitch without seeing more, i'd guess you might be able to attach data to the sent/recieved data that corresponds with your DOM nodes.
[17:22:16] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- the second one maps to the first.
[17:22:18] <LinksEz> Appreciate the helps.
[17:22:20] <LinksEz> <3
[17:22:31] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, what do you ean?
[17:22:37] <CrowX-> mean*
[17:22:43] <CrowX-> maps, as in it executes the first?
[17:22:48] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- .click() is a convenience method for .on('click', function(){});
[17:22:53] <CrowX-> i see
[17:23:16] <CrowX-> is it the same with $(selector).load   and $(selector).on('load'....?
[17:23:25] <vxitch> duch_kazatel: is there a way to add to the data in an ajax request? either by .ajaxSetup() or .ajaxSend() ?
[17:23:25] <duch_kazatel> .load() is a special case.  clarify :)
[17:24:10] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, if I don't add a location argument for an ajax call
[17:24:15] <CrowX-> is it the same then?
[17:24:18] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:24:27] <Velveeta> $(selector).load and $(selector).on('load' are 2 different things
[17:24:33] <CrowX-> ok
[17:24:36] <Velveeta> one of them is an event listener, the other is an ajax method
[17:25:31] <duch_kazatel> thank you.
[17:29:21] * __joshua__ just learnt about calc. holy shit
[18:17:00] <rofel> any users of select2 around?
[19:32:39] <xunil> hi
[19:32:52] <xunil> Interesting question: Can a jquery / javascript object aliased to a DOM element?
[19:32:58] <xunil> Or is this is too complicated?
[19:33:06] <xunil> Currently I encapsulate the DOM element as property.
[19:33:15] <Shadowz3n> console.log($(".class")[0]);
[19:34:04] <xunil> And also I use the data() feature.
[19:34:10] <xunil> But is there a more elegant, transparent way?
[19:35:13] <Shadowz3n> you can use $(".class").data("info", {test:1})
[19:35:53] <technosexual> so I'm using notify.js... and it's pretty sweet.
[19:36:22] <technosexual> for some reason I just can't seem to position them where I want them to be.
[19:38:51] <technosexual> nvm, I figured it out.
[21:31:05] <PaalJoachim> Hey. Ninja Forms a really good up and coming Contact form somewhat similar to Gravity forms in ease of use and features needs some jQuery and Js help with drag and drop features. If your interested in helping to develop Ninja Forms check this out: https://github.com/wpninjas/ninja-forms/issues/214
[21:31:31] <PaalJoachim> They also need help with other aspects as well.
[22:09:41] <Fishbowne2> anyone familar with Jquery-Ui ?
[22:10:01] <Fishbowne2> if i make a div draggable ?  How do i know if it lands on another div ?
[22:22:50] <terabit> is this a good place to ask about d3/nvd3?
[22:29:52] <mikeche1en> terabit: does d3 use jquery?
[22:31:19] <terabit> nvm,nope don't think so I guess ,let me know if there is a channel for it :)
[22:52:36] <mikeche1en> terabit: maybe #javascript? depends how specific the question is
[22:55:36] <terabit> not too specific I think just want to learn how to generate sample data for two lines on the graph
[22:55:37] <terabit> thanks
