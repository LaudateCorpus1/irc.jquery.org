[00:02:11] <noregret> ezakimak: it's an object
[00:02:20] <ezakimak> then it's not json
[00:03:01] <sacho_> noregret, serializeArray returns an array. There's no JSON type in javascript.
[00:03:09] <ezakimak> JSON.stringify(obj)
[00:03:36] <noregret> sacho_: yeah, i meant it's an object.. js object..
[00:03:43] <noregret> ezakimak: great, thanks
[00:03:59] <ezakimak> if you want it pretty to read: JSON.stringify(obj, null, '\t');
[00:04:27] <lemonsparrow> I have 4 autocomplete text fields in a single page for my app. Here I am using $(document).ready(function() for loading all the 3 text fields data and there are almost close to 5k entries... because of this it's taking a lot of time for the page to load and the data to load before the user could start typing into the textfield. what could be the best way to handle this scenario ? any other better logic or jquery api instead of 
[00:04:54] <noregret> ezakimak: hmm, not what I had in mind, i want it serialized, as the same string returned from .serialize()
[00:04:55] <ezakimak> don't send all 5k entries
[00:05:25] <ezakimak> and don't do it in ready()
[00:05:58] <ezakimak> do it in the search event
[00:06:42] <noregret> ah, $.param does it
[00:07:32] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: ok.. so u mean.. fire ajax on each character input by user to fetch matching results ?
[00:08:14] <sacho_> noregret, why not just use .serialize() then?
[00:08:31] <noregret> sacho_: coz i'm editing the array
[00:08:36] <sacho_> ah, ok.
[00:08:53] <noregret> btw, how can i remove a pair from an array?
[00:08:57] <noregret> a name:value pair ie
[00:09:30] <sacho_> you can remove a property from an object via delete.
[00:09:30] <ezakimak> lemonsparrow, not necessarily everytime--but that would be a good start
[00:09:39] <ezakimak> add more logic you can make it even smarter
[00:10:08] <ezakimak> you can trade i/o for cpu
[00:10:15] <sacho_> lemonsparrow, why is it taking the page a long time to load?
[00:10:37] <noregret> sacho_: array.delete? i don't find such method
[00:10:41] <grek> i create example
[00:10:42] <grek> http://jsfiddle.net/7xGE9/1/
[00:10:47] <sacho_> lemonsparrow, you can load the entries asynchronously. When the user starts typing, if they haven't been loaded yet, show a loading bar.
[00:10:55] <sacho_> noregret, delete is an operator.
[00:11:00] <sacho_> noregret, your question is unclear.
[00:11:31] <grek> how to change this function to i send form as array witch orginal form stucture
[00:11:51] <tw2113> sacho_, noregret wants to remove an array index
[00:12:00] <ezakimak> which corner does offset's coords refer to? the outer corner of the margin? the corner of the border? inner corner of the padding?
[00:12:26] <ezakimak> an array index *is* a property. use delete.
[00:12:26] <sacho_> I think the element
[00:12:44] <ezakimak> but if it's not the last element it will become a sparse array.
[00:13:05] <ezakimak> if you don't care about the index values, you can use splice to remove an element of the array, moving everything else down one to take it's place
[00:14:03] <noregret> sacho_: http://pastie.org/7722894 i have this array, i want to remove an object from there (.e.g "alltime:0" )
[00:14:35] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: now I am doing something like this : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5465494 I am using DWR for ajax
[00:14:50] <sacho_> noregret, see all ezakimak said.
[00:15:38] <ezakimak> lemonsparrow, you're unconditionally loading all data up front
[00:15:48] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: is there also a way I could load this and cache it.. instead if having to trigger an ajax each time the page reloads.. something like that ?
[00:15:59] <ezakimak> you could use local storage
[00:16:22] <ezakimak> or put it in it's own js file and let the browser cache it
[00:16:31] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: yep... and there r 3 more like that inside $(document).ready(function(){	for another 3 textfields.. massive amount of data..
[00:16:54] <noregret> so i should use splice in my case ?
[00:17:10] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: yep but I don't know how to code it.. I mean I want to optimize this further but I am kinda lost.. could just improve that code so that I could understand it better..
[00:18:01] <ezakimak> well, it will be more interactive if all of the data is already loaded, but 1st load will of course be slow
[00:18:18] <ezakimak> but you could put it in a separate js file and send it zipped
[00:18:28] <sacho_> noregret, sure, that would work
[00:18:29] <ezakimak> you'd have to configure your webserver for compression though
[00:18:31] <Martin1982> Anyone here going to the Dutch Mobile Conference?
[00:19:41] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: first load is slow.. yes.. so u mean can we still go ahead with  $(document).ready(function() as I am doing ryt now and then look at something like a caching perspective.. is that what u r looking at  ?
[00:20:08] <noregret> sacho_: what if i don't kow the index ?
[00:20:20] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: I am using apache 2.2 as webserver and tomcat app server
[00:20:35] <ezakimak> if you put it in it's own js file, and add a <script> tag in header, it can be fetched in parallel w/your other script files (executed in serial of course), and cached via the browser's default file caching
[00:20:48] <sacho_> noregret, then you'd need to find it out
[00:21:04] <nonuby> if i have two elements how can I perform a jquery action on both without resorting to selectors again
[00:21:19] <sacho_> how do you have two elements
[00:21:22] <nonuby> i.e. Ive already plucked out the elements via selectors previously
[00:21:42] <sacho_> you can place them in one collection via add
[00:21:43] <ezakimak> call it on each
[00:21:56] <nonuby> so el1.add(el2).blur()?
[00:22:02] <ezakimak> either you do it twice or group them and jquery will have to loop either way
[00:22:30] <sacho_> nonuby, you don't gain much unless you have a lot of actions you want to perform on them
[00:23:09] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: I have this code in a separate js file inside my webserver (apache) which is serving the static content and I am including this file inside my jsp like <script src="/admin/publisher/Id-url.js"></script>
[00:23:28] <ezakimak> is the data static?
[00:24:01] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: no the js file has code including DWR (ajax) to fetch the data from database..
[00:24:15] <ezakimak> how often does your data change?
[00:24:15] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: the data isnt static.. it's coming from the db tables ryt..
[00:24:57] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: well.. I would have to get back to u on that.. but I believe since the entries are huge close to 5k.. it should be quite frequent getting updated..
[00:25:21] <ezakimak> and how long are the labels?
[00:26:20] <lemonsparrow> string array..
[00:26:21] <ezakimak> do the entries themselves change, or just which entries exist?
[00:26:37] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: what does how long mean ? r u asking the array length ? close to 5 k ryt
[00:26:39] <ezakimak> eg, does id 123's meaning change, or just whether there is an entry w/id 123 at all?
[00:27:21] <ezakimak> wait, now i'm confused. you're loading up an autocomplete--for a selection, doesn't each item they can select have a short label?
[00:27:42] <ezakimak> are you saying an individual entry they select is 5k of data?
[00:28:41] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: something like {"cat", "dog", ''elephant"} like that
[00:28:53] <ezakimak> is that one entry or 3?
[00:29:14] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: yep I cant type 5k values here ryt... some values are quite long
[00:29:16] <lemonsparrow> :)
[00:32:59] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: how can I cache these values.. that's the only question
[00:33:01] <grek> ezakimak:  you see it ? http://jsfiddle.net/7xGE9/1/ is possible to get array witch correct names ?
[00:33:21] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: after loadint it for once.. I dont want to fetch it each time I refresh/load the page..
[00:33:48] <ezakimak> if it changes you have to
[00:34:01] <ezakimak> you still haven't adequately described your data
[00:34:46] * coldhead np: tortoise - salt the skies
[00:37:37] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: my data that comes to the page is array of string close to length 5k... what more detail u would like to have regarding the data /
[00:38:12] <ezakimak> pastebin an array of two items, shorten the strings like "foo....bar"
[00:39:06] <coldhead> isomorphic structure
[00:39:12] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: didnt get you
[00:39:12] <coldhead> crippled symmetries
[00:39:33] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: I already gave u my logic of code -> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5465494
[00:39:57] <ezakimak> i saw that.
[00:40:22] <ezakimak> so you are literally letting a user choose from among several 5k strings with an autocomplete? wth is in these strings?
[00:40:34] <ezakimak> how many strings are they selecting between?
[00:41:28] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: close to 5k strings :)
[00:41:35] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: yes
[00:41:46] <ezakimak> 5k 5k-long strings?
[00:41:50] <ezakimak> so 25MB
[00:42:43] <ezakimak> and what do you display in the autocomplete box? the whole string? or just the first X chars?
[00:42:49] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: but initially I was passing an entire list of 5k objects so it was taking time.. now only 5k strings instead of whole objects.. so now it's kinda become more faster.. all I would want now is a way to cache this data after loading it for first time.. so that ajax isnt fired on each reload/ page refresh each time..
[00:43:10] <ezakimak> local storage can only hold 20MB i think
[00:43:25] <ezakimak> i think you may need to rethink your UI/IA on this
[00:43:45] <ezakimak> how do you console.log in jsfiddle?
[00:44:10] <ezakimak> nm. it's working
[00:44:18] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: string_variable.length = 3000 for 3 text fields.. 1000strings each are being loaded so total 3k
[00:44:53] <ezakimak> no, that's 9MB
[00:44:58] <lemonsparrow> http://jsfiddle.net/dublinan/QvJJt/
[00:45:32] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: u mean 3000 strings size is 9mb ?
[00:48:47] <ezakimak> you said 1000 string, 3k length each, 3 text fields. 3 x 3k x 1000 = 9MB
[00:49:45] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: I meant.. 3 string arrays of length 1000each  :) array length
[00:52:41] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: how to cache this data after first load. ?
[00:54:24] <Whirl3d> I have to create a visual representation of a large number of calls based on their date/time/content. I thought it would be a timeline, but that's not really working. Any suggestions using jquery?
[00:56:01] <ezakimak> lemonsparrow, so only 3 strings, 1000 chars each?
[00:56:17] <coldhead> good grief are you kids still at it :(
[00:56:20] <noregret> $.each() takes an array by reference ?
[00:56:41] <ezakimak> Whirl3d, i think you're approaching it wrong. don't ask "how can I solve this with tool X" if you don't even know what you want it to do yet .... :)
[00:56:59] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: ok lets say array = {"cat", "mouse", "elephant"} here array length is 3 ryt ? and how many chars are there ?
[00:57:18] <ezakimak> 16 total. avg 4 chars per item
[00:57:19] <coldhead> bot-t: sup
[00:57:20] <bot-t> Not much dude, jus’ hangin’ ’n’ chillin’
[00:57:25] <ezakimak> er avg 5.3
[00:58:47] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: ok for me 3 string arrays of 1000 strings each so total 3000 items and avg 5 chars each so 3000*6 = 18k chars
[01:00:30] <ezakimak> that's not too huge these days
[01:00:39] <ezakimak> you could cache that in local storage
[01:01:27] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: ok.. so suppose I cache it and then again I refresh the page.. will it still trigger ajax ? since it's $(document).ready(function(){	
[01:01:36] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: I might need to modify the code ryt ?
[01:01:39] <ezakimak> grek, your find() is failing because your <input>'s in the html don't have type attributes--so none match
[01:03:00] <noregret> someone take a look at http://pastie.org/7723016 please, im trying to remove some items but i'm not able to, any ideas
[01:03:06] <grek> but i get input values only problem is name as arras so if i create new array - a dont know how to do it - merge ? in i have array[inputnameasarray]
[01:03:09] <grek> its error
[01:03:21] <ezakimak> http://jsfiddle.net/7xGE9/2/
[01:03:47] <coldhead> mobile development https://www.aldimobile.com.au/siteimages/upload/skin.jpg
[01:03:59] <Nebros> what i have to do, if i will have the message of line 12 in red? http://jsfiddle.net/R93Tk/
[01:04:23] <grek> and you have in testform - test[] as string not array
[01:04:28] <ezakimak> grek, you will need to parse your input name's and search for /^.*[[][]]$/ , to distinguish them and build your array
[01:05:00] <ezakimak> er /^.*\[\]$/
[01:05:28] <ezakimak> or substring test
[01:05:53] <grek> ok so is not possible to easy , so easier is - $(inputs).serialize() then send - {data:serialized} and in serwer - witch php - parse_str for data
[01:06:12] <grek> is hard for my build array in js :(
[01:06:41] <grek> multidimension - if input have name -  example[aa][bb][cc] value 1
[01:06:41] <ezakimak> you probably want == not ===
[01:07:03] <coldhead> SOON TO BE ROLLING IN THE LONELY
[01:08:16] <ezakimak> nm. === is fine
[01:08:56] <ezakimak> why not just do $('#formid').submit() ?
[01:08:57] <lemonsparrow> hi ezakimak :)
[01:09:24] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: got logged out for couple of minutes.. so how to cache the autocomplete data here ?
[01:09:29] <lemonsparrow> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5465494
[01:09:46] <grek> beacose i want get it as one var - form[id]=response as  array
[01:10:29] <ezakimak> lemonsparrow, just put it in localstorage, if it's not there fetch it, if it is, only fetch it if it's stale (you determine how stale--also store the timestamp when you fetched it last)
[01:11:20] <ezakimak> http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html
[01:11:55] <ezakimak> localStorage.getItem('name') -> a string
[01:12:08] <ezakimak> localStorage.setItem('name', astringvalue)
[01:12:13] <ezakimak> easy peasy
[01:12:18] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: I don't know abt this.. could u show the same in my code pls ?
[01:12:28] <ezakimak> i don't have gisthub account
[01:12:46] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: u can create a public one here gist.github.com
[01:12:54] <ezakimak> i just gave you the example
[01:13:10] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: just modify my code.. thanks https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5465494
[01:14:11] <ezakimak> it won't let me
[01:14:35] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: use pastebin :)
[01:15:04] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: also since my code is insite document ready wont it still load the content over and over again
[01:15:05] <lemonsparrow> ?
[01:15:32] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: shouldnt I also check if localstorage value is there or not.. of not then trigger ajax to get data else use the local data ?
[01:16:53] <ezakimak> yes
[01:17:20] <ezakimak> just only do the ajax request if it doesn't have the data or the data is stale
[01:17:52] <shafox> i am dynamically adding text to the input field , and checking if the input field is filled then show the form or else no.  this is my file. whats wrong with it. it is supposed to show me the form when there is something in the input fields but its not showing anything http://jsfiddle.net/kqHmR/1/
[01:17:55] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: pls help me modify the code so that i could learn.. I am kinda lost ...
[01:18:09] <ezakimak> put it in a pastebin
[01:18:12] <ezakimak> er fiddle even better
[01:18:42] <noregret> can someone take a look at http://pastie.org/7723071 please, im trying to remove some items but i'm not able to, any help is appriciated
[01:19:01] <noregret> i tried several methods, all failed
[01:19:38] <noregret> what i want here is to remove the last 2 items ( not always teh last)
[01:20:58] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: http://pastebin.com/7Bxafwig
[01:23:11] <ezakimak> noregret, well, you're modifying the same array you're iterating over--which may be problematic
[01:23:52] <shafox> anyone tell me what the problem is ?? http://jsfiddle.net/kqHmR/1/
[01:24:14] <noregret> ezakimak: what is another way for that ?
[01:24:45] <ezakimak> try grep()
[01:25:09] <ezakimak> or code a regular for loop and adjust indexes accordingly as you go through
[01:25:14] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: hope u got the pastebin link
[01:25:38] <shafox> in console the code is working but not in the browser
[01:26:32] <ezakimak> lemonsparrow, where is DWRlogic documented? and why are you usingi t?
[01:27:17] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: that is inside java class.. where I am just passing the string array to jsp..
[01:27:25] <noregret> ezakimak: i tried var bar = foo and then looped thru bar and splliced foo, and still got that error ? are assignments in JS also go by ference ?
[01:27:31] <noregret> reference *
[01:27:36] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: http://directwebremoting.org/dwr/index.html
[01:29:46] <ezakimak> http://pastebin.com/eaeKY9nA
[01:29:55] <ezakimak> wow. pastebin's editor is attrocious
[01:30:24] <ezakimak> because bar *is* foo.
[01:30:29] <ezakimak> arrays are reference types
[01:30:33] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: will try this thanks :)
[01:31:34] <ezakimak> noregret, simple for loop: for (var i = foo.length - 1; i <= 0; i--) { if (need-to-remove) { foo.splice(i, 1); } }
[01:32:24] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: IN LINE 5 SHOULD THERE BE A SEMI COLON ?
[01:32:28] <lemonsparrow> sorry caps lock
[01:32:50] <ezakimak> it's optional
[01:32:55] <ezakimak> but yeah, i forgot
[01:33:53] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: I get an error 	  var data = <unserialize>(localStorage.getItem('data'));
[01:34:03] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: SyntaxError: syntax error
[01:34:06] <ezakimak> you need to implement serialize and unserialize
[01:34:17] <ezakimak> replace those with however you do that
[01:34:34] <ezakimak> JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() can work
[01:34:51] <ezakimak> but where you have a lib already, it may provide something for you
[01:35:03] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: so how would the code change ? could u edit it http://pastebin.com/eaeKY9nA
[01:35:04] <ezakimak> if you can get it serialized from your lib you don't have to do it twice
[01:35:22] <ezakimak> replace <serialize>(...) with JSON.stringify(...)
[01:35:54] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: it's <unserialize> and not <serialize>
[01:36:03] <ezakimak> you need both
[01:36:09] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: also where are we serializing it first that u r calling  <unserialize>
[01:36:21] <ezakimak> local storage only stores strings
[01:36:27] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: ok
[01:36:29] <ezakimak> so you must serialize your data
[01:36:51] <ezakimak> does your dwr lib send json or xml, or do you know?
[01:37:03] <ezakimak> json will likely serialize much smaller than xml
[01:38:36] <ezakimak> also, if you do have a lot of data, you could find a string compression lib and use that also

[04:12:20] <Miguel> If you move the mouse over 01 a tooltip will appear. If you then move it faster over 02 it won't. I know this happens because I have a delay on hide so I can move the mouse over the tooltip itself so when there is a menu or something like that
[04:12:50] <Miguel> Does anyone knows how to solve this? I finally made everything working but I am missing this part. Thakn You.
[04:25:42] <Anticom> Miguel just a short question: why reinvent the wheel?
[04:25:52] <Wamer> guys, i need advice
[04:26:05] <Anticom> Miguel http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/
[04:26:08] <Wamer> i need to change style of one element when hover over another
[04:27:24] <Miguel> @Anticom: because most tooltips out there have to many options or do not fill my requirements. And I really would like some code I could easily change according to my needs. I often use other people Jquery plugins but in this case I really would like to use mine
[04:29:50] <Miguel> @Anticom. For example, Qtip even has a modal. I do not want a modal. I already have one ... I really would like to make my tooltip plugin to work.

[05:23:15] <daanavitch> how can I make a link clickable if there's an object above it?
[05:25:05] <seutje> `g mdn pointer-events
[05:25:06] <b-ot> seutje: pointer-events - CSS | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/pointer-events
[05:25:09] <seutje> daanavitch: ^
[05:25:22] <seutje> either that or manually passing the click along, which is somewhat of a pita
[05:25:37] <daanavitch> seutje: thanks, pointer-events: none; works
[05:25:51] <Nebros> what i have to do, if i will have the message of line 12 in red? http://jsfiddle.net/R93Tk/
[05:27:59] <seutje> Nebros: some css, I suppose
[05:29:03] <Nebros> do they know how this js works? :D
[05:29:13] <seutje> Nebros: label.error { color: red; }
[05:29:32] <seutje> it doesn't have to, that's the beauty of decoupled shiznitz
[05:30:09] <Nebros> thank you :)
[05:38:14] <uros> Hi guys does anyone of you know to tell me how can I unbind the specific event hanler I have previousely attached to $(window).on('resize', someHandler);?
[05:38:47] <uros> I have tried $(window).off('resize', someHandler); but for some reason it doens't work.
[05:39:07] <uros> I have found that for $(window).off('resize'); works only.
[05:39:35] <uros> Does anyone know is what I want possible and how? Thanks at advance.
[05:46:01] <thaifood> Can anyone tell me how to set a drop down value to selected please?  I have tried this:  http://fpaste.org/FFpY/
[05:50:36] <seutje> thaifood: works fine for me http://jsfiddle.net/9g5nQ/
[05:51:00] <thaifood> hmm, something fishy here
[05:51:06] <seutje> note that the string u pass to val needs to be the value, not the innerText
[05:53:35] <bguery> hi
[05:56:08] <bguery> I do $('#selec').live('click', function(e) { var options = { context: this }; d = My.ajax.post(options); // wrapper for $.ajax d.complete(function() { console.log(this); }); but I got My object as this instead of the element
[05:56:16] <bguery> do I do something wrong?
[05:58:36] <thaifood> seutje,  right,  thanks
[06:00:24] <sacho> bguery, please show a test case since your description wasn't too clear. When calling My.ajax.post(), this is set to My.ajax. Also, .live is deprecated and you should use the more explicit .on.
[06:00:43] <sl33k_> async: false in my .ajax() is causing browser freezing. Would removing it avoid that?
[06:02:40] <bguery> sacho, well here is my test case https://gist.github.com/borisguery/dd0e82b02a3fdb6e4e04
[06:02:42] <bguery> nothing more
[06:02:56] <thaifood> seutje, i had my drop down populated from a $.getJSON so i had to do the drop down selected in the callback.  thanks !
[06:03:05] <bguery> I know about .live but I would rather understand first how to properly bind the context
[06:05:27] <seutje> thaifood: oh, yeah that can be tricky sometimes
[06:05:59] <thaifood> and i'm old and feeble :-)
[06:06:18] <sacho> bguery, what does your .put() function do?
[06:08:22] <bguery> sacho, put: function(options) { return this.post(url, options); } where post: function(options) { return $.ajax(options); }
[06:08:41] <bguery> sacho, give it away
[06:08:46] <bguery> I found my error
[06:08:56] <sacho> okay.
[06:08:59] <bguery> I let a context: this in { options } in post:
[06:09:04] <bguery> from an old copy/paste
[06:09:27] <bguery> anyway thank you for the deep dive in it
[06:10:48] <rvsjoen> is it possible to use noconflict mode and bind $ inside, say, a single function or a limited scope ?
[06:12:32] <bguery> rvsjoen, not sure but you may try to do something like $.noConflict(); function($) { …. }(jQuery)
[06:12:49] <bguery> and properly use $ inside your function scope
[06:17:07] <rvsjoen> hm, that might work
[06:18:10] <seutje> that's actually the preferred way of doing it afaik
[06:19:40] <seismo> oy!
[06:20:40] <rvsjoen> meh, its too late on a friday afternoon... $.noConflict(); function($){/*meh*/}(jQuery); whats wrong with that ?
[06:20:49] <rvsjoen> says unexpected token (
[06:21:55] <seismo> hm nope
[06:22:16] <seismo> i have a strange problem. during a .show() with jquery-ui bounce effect theres a mysterious margin under the element. about 20 px. when the show effect is over the margin disappears. any ideas?
[06:22:55] <rvsjoen> oh, its missing a couple of ()
[06:23:16] <seismo> oy. nice :)
[06:28:09] <thaifood> I'm passing a $_GET var to JS but don't know how to test if it exists.  I don't want to try to assign it if it doesn't exist.    var ipType = '<?=$_GET["ipType"]?>';
[06:29:08] <seismo> ThaiBoi12: you can check it serverside with isset(); and then assign a special value like undefined to it if it didn't exist
[06:30:18] <thaifood> hmmmm, tricky
[06:31:38] <seismo> thaifood: http://nopaste.info/50d503d898.html
[06:32:06] <thaifood> thanks seismo,  that will work
[06:32:15] <thaifood> i don't like error messages in the log :-)
[06:32:31] <seismo> yeh
[06:32:58] <seismo> forgot a )
[06:33:04] <seismo> don't copy&paste
[06:33:50] <thaifood> i did this  http://fpaste.org/Ccig/
[06:35:11] <thaifood> then in js  http://fpaste.org/mRuh/
[06:35:17] <StephenS> thaifood: look at your get names
[06:35:45] <thaifood> what's wrong
[06:35:53] <StephenS> $_GET['spurdo'] must be set in URL in order to process further one
[06:36:12] <thaifood> ?
[06:36:19] <StephenS> but I see only php side, where do you parse it
[06:36:30] <thaifood> then in js  http://fpaste.org/mRuh/
[06:37:49] <StephenS> what is $searchIP, are you sure it is set
[06:38:10] <thaifood> http://fpaste.org/sQ0E/
[06:39:09] <StephenS> is this js http://fpaste.org/mRuh/ how the heck you make $SearchIP in js?
[06:39:53] <thaifood> yeah i got to fix that hehehe   thanks
[06:40:01] <StephenS> if( <?=$searchIP ?> != "undefined"){
[06:40:14] <StephenS> or whatever you do with that $searchIP "var"
[06:40:23] <thaifood> exactly
[06:40:36] <thaifood> thanks StephenS,  happy friday to all
[06:41:25] <thaifood> i think i need single quotes too    if( '<?=$searchIP ?>' != "undefined" )
[06:41:49] <StephenS> ...
[06:43:48] <Joel> that fool still hasn't figured out how to use jsfiddle?
[06:44:09] * thaifood ducks
[06:46:59] <thaifood> That worked well,  thanks.  on php side:  if( isset($_GET["ipType"]) ){ $ipType = $_GET["ipType"]; }else{ $ipType = "undefined"; }
[06:47:09] <thaifood> on js side   if( '<?=$ipType ?>' != "undefined" ){ var ipType = '<?=$ipType ?>'; }
[06:51:40] <travalas> i have an odd problem with jquerymobile, my javascript runs if i link to the site, but if i navigate there via "navbar" it doesn't. it's almost like the javascript doesn't load.  thoughts?
[06:58:35] <jo_> G'morning #jquery.
[06:59:00] <travalas> maybe i figured out my problem does javascript need to be within data-role="page"
[07:03:33] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!
[07:04:37] <Bloomberg> Can I to use the :eq() selector with inputs?
[07:08:36] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Toadilly.
[07:09:01] <BillCriswell> $('form input:eq(2)') would grab the second input.
[07:09:56] <zuloyd> hi
[07:10:30] <zuloyd> does it make sense to preload images by inserting an invisible dom element of them into the body? will they then be cached and loaded immediately when they appear again later?
[07:11:57] <miketaylr> zuloyd: it's enough to just do var f = new Image(); f.src = "bloop.jpg"
[07:12:09] <zuloyd> ok. thanks
[07:12:13] <miketaylr> don't even need to put them in the DOM
[07:12:33] <BillCriswell> zuloyd: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/476679/preloading-images-with-jquery this had a lot of good insight on it.
[07:12:36] <zuloyd> and this will affect any type of image later, whether it is an <img> or a background image via css?
[07:12:43] <miketaylr> (and you can listen for the load event on those images if you need to wait)
[07:12:49] <jrajav> Have there been any significant changes to the 'sortable' API between 1.8 and 1.10?
[07:12:55] <miketaylr> zuloyd: either way, it'll be preloaded
[07:13:01] <jrajav> We're having a lot of code that uses it break when we try to upgrade
[07:13:20] <jrajav> Most of it "cannot call methods on sortable prior to initialization"
[07:14:02] <BillCriswell> This one is night and quick: $.each(['foo.jpg', 'bar.png'], function(){ (new Image).src = this });
[07:14:07] <BillCriswell> s/night/nice
[07:20:47] <zuloyd> BillCriswell: how can I do something when the images have been loaded?
[07:21:33] <BillCriswell> Do what miketaylr suggested.
[07:25:21] <chachan> guys, I'm getting a list of objects through $.ajax(dataType: "json").responseText. What's the best way to retrieve all this information?
[07:26:39] <chachan> I mean, to walk through the item list and get their properties
[07:27:40] <BillCriswell> $.each()
[07:28:16] <BillCriswell> chachan: ^
[07:30:02] <chachan> BillCriswell, I tried that first, but the response is a string. And the server is sending a JSON object
[07:30:41] <chachan> in other case I would get an exception since I'm using dataType: "json" as I mentioned it
[07:30:57] <BillCriswell> chachan: That's fine. $.each( response, function(i,el){ console.log( el.propertyName ); });
[07:31:25] <BillCriswell> Are you returning a straight json object or an array of objects?
[07:35:15] <ShrtSong> I have a question about jquery datatables. Do i ask here or in another channel?
[07:36:01] <ShrtSong> (Sorry in advance if I can't ask to ask here.)
[07:45:51] <ohcibi> when does localStorage throw a dom exception 18, when used?
[07:56:38] <darkmutt> hi a simple most likely question how would i change the accordion API to work with ul and li's instead of headers and div's?? is there a bot or something here?
[07:56:53] <Bloomberg> I'm getting this error ::  [09:56:38.633] NS_ERROR_XPC_NOT_ENOUGH_ARGS: Not enough arguments @ http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js?_=1366988196867:4
[07:57:14] <Bloomberg> This is the line
[07:57:15] <Bloomberg> 'namedes':$(this).children('input:text').eq(2)
[08:00:47] <supernov> hi all
[08:01:47] <supernov> Anyone know why this doesn't work?:          $("#something").animate({"left":"calc(13em - 33px)", "width":"calc(100% - 131px)"}, speed);
[08:03:10] <sacho> "doesn't work"?
[08:03:48] <supernov> Yes. It's as if I didn't call it at all. Using animate() without "calc" works fine, but this just does nothing.
[08:04:11] <clov3r> supernov: calc() probably doesn't want to be inside "'s
[08:04:49] <supernov> calc() is a CSS function though
[08:05:06] <clov3r> oh really?
[08:05:10] <supernov> yeah
[08:05:14] <clov3r> well THAT's good to know :P
[08:05:15] <BillCriswell> It's new fangled CSS.
[08:05:32] <BillCriswell> fangled... I should look that up.
[08:05:52] <supernov> That's probably the answer, eh? jQuery just doesn't support it yet.
[08:06:18] <sacho> probbly.
[08:06:20] <sacho> +a
[08:07:34] <BillCriswell> supernov: Sounds about right.
[08:08:17] <clov3r> heh, 'fangling'
[08:08:20] <clov3r> that's all i do
[08:08:21] <supernov> Grr
[08:08:24] <clov3r> programming? nah
[08:08:28] <clov3r> i'm just fangling around
[08:09:04] <BillCriswell> How dare jQuery not support absolutely everything ever.
[08:10:02] <BillCriswell> I hate SEO talk.
[08:10:05] <BillCriswell> Makes me squirm
[08:10:19] <sacho> you could extend jquery for that, it looks like you need to add a "tweener"
[08:11:32] <BillCriswell> I wonder where the 13em came from for his code. It just seems odd.
[08:14:49] <sifu> what could be the problem if the javascript is not affecting the div neither showing any errors...checked the div names and all...still nothing..
[08:15:35] <clov3r> sifu: code link?
[08:15:35] <BillCriswell> sifu: If you have some code to look at it's easier to figure out.
[08:15:48] <sifu> thats the part i am confused about
[08:15:56] <sifu> its working fine in jfiddle
[08:16:12] <sifu> so the code itself is working..
[08:16:24] <BillCriswell> sifu: Well, we can't possibly know what's happening before that code runs without seeing it. =)
[08:16:32] <sifu> okey let me share the code
[08:16:53] <BillCriswell> I'm guessing you're changing a class name or something and then trying to attach the event listened based on the old one? Something weird.
[08:17:47] <clov3r> or searching for class rather than id?
[08:18:03] <clov3r> or class=".class" instead of "class"
[08:18:08] <clov3r> i do those a lot :P
[08:20:29] <kongyang> I am sorry but it bother me a long time. I try to append newdiv which contains some <a> elements in it to an existing div, but how can I enable the click event on the <a> element? I tried all ways in stackoverflow, but all failed
[08:22:00] <clov3r> $('#divName').on('click','a', function() { <function> });
[08:22:31] <clov3r> (thank you billcriswell :) )
[08:24:59] <sifu> the code: http://jsbin.com/ugaxat/1/edit
[08:25:37] <sifu> as you can see works fine here
[08:25:53] <BillCriswell> Welcome! Not sure what I did.
[08:32:06] <clov3r> oh you showed me that on('click', 'child' function on jsbin the other day
[08:32:21] <clov3r> which incidentally is working fine on my firefox today
[08:33:23] <clov3r> sifu: what is the snippet that isn't working?
[08:33:45] <sifu> clov3r, the snippet is working there
[08:33:50] <sifu> when i try to use it on the test site
[08:33:58] <sifu> its not doing anything
[08:33:59] <clov3r> yep
[08:34:02] <clov3r> but which one is it?
[08:34:21] <sifu> you mean the site?
[08:34:49] <clov3r> ok so the whole block of code doesn't do anything in your site implementation?
[08:34:55] <sifu> yes sir
[08:35:05] <sifu> i tried to just do the .hide method
[08:35:09] <sifu> even that doesn't do anything
[08:35:32] <clov3r> do you have jquery loaded on your site?
[08:35:34] <sifu> i will try to put the code right on the page now...see if it's the include...
[08:35:43] <sifu> yes it is loaded...other sections using jquery are working fine
[08:42:24] <clov3r> if i have five li's and one is clicked on, what's the method to get it's position in the array of li
[08:42:42] <clov3r> ie if third-child is clicked, return 3
[08:43:58] <NoiseEee> clov3r: probably grab the collection of li's of the parent and compare via :is
[08:44:17] <NoiseEee> .is()
[08:48:15] <clov3r> well yeah i can do it by if target.is(:nth-child(1)), return 1, etc. and i suppose if could run a for loop with i.
[08:48:31] <clov3r> i was wondering if i can return the n number from nth-child automatically
[08:49:38] <pachet> ?.index() @ clov3r
[08:49:38] <bot-t> clov3r, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[08:49:58] <clov3r> perfect
[08:50:40] <sifu> folks whats this error: TypeError: $stickyEl.offset(...) is undefined
[08:51:05] <pachet> means that its likely not a jquery object
[08:51:16] <sifu> hmmm
[08:53:57] <sifu> http://jsbin.com/esiyoj/2/edit
[08:54:02] <clov3r> are you actually typing $stickyEl or $('.stickyEl')?
[08:54:14] <sifu> thts the code
[08:54:30] <sifu> sadly its copy and paste (so i don't fully understand it yet)
[08:54:41] <clov3r> you have a '#' in the selector for $stickEl
[08:54:56] <sifu> yep removed it
[08:55:52] <sifu> still getting the same error
[08:56:09] <sifu> and i found out that because of this error...the other part of the script is not working
[08:57:48] <clov3r> http://jsbin.com/esiyoj/3/edit
[08:58:01] <clov3r> works for me, alerts offset of ordersummary
[08:58:14] <sifu> hmm okey let me give it a go thanks
[08:58:43] <clov3r> didn't test the second part
[08:59:19] <sifu> still not happy it is....
[08:59:43] <clov3r> it's alerting undefined still?
[08:59:48] <sifu> yep
[08:59:56] <clov3r> have you c/pd the code exactly?
[09:00:07] <sifu> okey
[09:00:34] <clov3r> maybe you have put $stickyel= blah on its own line
[09:00:39] <clov3r> not following a comma
[09:00:51] <clov3r> and it needs its own "var " in front of it to declare?
[09:00:54] <sifu> yes it is in 2nd line
[09:01:17] <sifu> http://jsbin.com/esiyoj/2/edit
[09:02:54] <sifu> put it in the same line and still undefined
[09:03:30] <ShrtSong> Anyone familiar with jquery datatables?
[09:03:36] <clov3r> for me, i get that error when i'm editing the html
[09:03:47] <sifu> hmmm
[09:03:59] <clov3r> not when i'm running
[09:04:00] <lxsameer> hi, i use ajax to get a json from a remote server, in FF the returned data is string but in chrom its object, why?
[09:04:22] <sifu> clov3r, if you want i can pm you the link and see it in the test site
[09:04:30] <sifu> that might make it more clear
[09:04:42] <clov3r> yep
[09:04:48] <clov3r> do it :)
[09:04:50] <sifu> thanks..just a moment
[09:04:52] <TonkaTruck> I need to build a huge closure that "includes" multiple js sources.  I think this is how query is actually built but I can't figure out if it's by GruntJS, or by the release.js.  Anyway…it's a third-party widget and I need all these tested modules nicely tucked in a single closure.  Can someone tell me what to google other than "closure compiler" because that appears to just minify and concat.
[09:05:41] <sifu> clov3r, the link is there....if you open firebug...you can see the error
[09:05:54] <clov3r> yep
[09:05:58] <clov3r> i see it
[09:06:37] <sacho> TonkaTruck, jquery uses grunt
[09:07:08] <TonkaTruck> sacho: I read the grunt file but can't figure out what the 'build' task is doing based on its config.
[09:07:21] <sifu> clov3r, so any idea why it might not be working?
[09:08:05] <sacho> TonkaTruck, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/README.md
[09:08:30] <clov3r> there is no element with class ordersummary on your page?
[09:08:41] <sifu> its in another page
[09:09:02] <clov3r> well what page is that on then?
[09:09:06] <Acrack> hello
[09:09:21] <clov3r> you can't reference an element in jquery from a page other than the one that is loaded
[09:10:26] <sifu> clov3r, ohh...
[09:10:37] <clov3r> heh
[09:10:52] <clov3r> love that ;)
[09:10:54] <sifu> but how would that work in joomla..as all the js is loaded from index.php
[09:11:04] <clov3r> well sure
[09:11:18] <clov3r> does it work on the page that actually contains that element?
[09:11:21] <TonkaTruck> sacho: Heh, just noticed intro.js and outro.js in the source.  I had no idea it was done this way haha…way overthinking this.  I expected an output "template" with tags.
[09:11:25] <sifu> yes sir it does
[09:11:41] <clov3r> well then i would just put a check in your js, for the page url
[09:12:05] <sifu> ohhh okey...
[09:12:16] <clov3r> if (window.location == 'specific page')
[09:12:21] <clov3r> or ===
[09:12:28] <clov3r> can't remember which
[09:12:38] <sacho> TonkaTruck, I think the whole point of grunt is to use js instead of a declarative language
[09:12:50] <sifu> hmm okey...i will see about that...thanks...gota run home now though
[09:13:30] <clov3r> ok sifu
[09:13:34] <clov3r> btw http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fspirehire.kee.uk.com%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.3+http%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fservices
[09:13:40] <clov3r> ah shit
[09:13:43] <clov3r> sorry
[09:13:48] <sifu> ha no prob
[09:13:56] <jop008> When I have                   var elements = document.getElementsByTagName('td')
[09:13:57] <jop008>                   for (var i=0; i<elements.length; i++){
[09:13:58] <jop008>                       text = elements[i].innerHTML;
[09:13:59] <jop008>                   }
[09:13:59] <jop008> HOw can I traverse to the row form elements[i]
[09:14:06] <sacho> please don't paste code in the channel
[09:14:13] <jop008> 4 lines
[09:14:17] <TonkaTruck> sacho: I use GruntJS religiously.  I just didn't think it was as simple as creating an intro/outro to your destination closure.  If this is how jQuery team does it…it's umm…way good enough for me.
[09:14:34] <sacho> Ah, ok.
[09:14:59] <jop008> I canput it in one line also :-)
[09:15:33] <clov3r> jop008 probably elements[i].parent() would work?
[09:15:35] <jop008> can I use closest from elements [i]
[09:15:59] <jop008> yes parent will do stupid me
[09:20:00] <velts> hello, anyone know why I am getting the following error.. TypeError: a is null
[09:20:22] <velts> i have isolated the line of code to the following: $("input#newaddressradio").click();
[09:21:54] <sacho> You should isolate it to a test case.
[09:21:58] <jop008> How do I get the value of a select node?
[09:22:27] <sacho> $select.val()
[09:22:28] <velts> $('select').val();
[09:23:20] <jop008> found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1085801/how-to-get-the-selected-value-of-dropdownlist-using-javascript
[09:23:31] <sacho> good for you.
[09:24:31] <clov3r> velts: no idea why that one line of code doesn't work, but it's a better idea to search for $('#newaddressradio'). it's an id, there will only ever be one,
[09:24:48] <clov3r> but maybe you have a reason
[09:24:59] <clov3r> anyway, got a fiddle/bin?
[09:28:48] <ShrtSong> So, the problem I'm having is that I need to get a generated column off to the right of my data using jquery datatables. I don't want to do it in the json generated server-side. Anybody have any idea how I can do this?
[09:28:56] <ShrtSong> The column needs to contain links
[09:29:35] <ShrtSong> <a href="/Edit/{ID_GOES_HERE}">Edit</a>
[09:30:46] <cwatson> Hello everyone, I'm not sure why my jQuery slider is not working. Any ideas? - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77127384/contentSlider2/index.html
[09:31:38] <cwatson> I want it to slide up and down.
[09:34:07] <jwmann> What would be the appropriate method for checking to see if an attr = something
[09:34:33] <jwmann> like $('#foo').attr('myattr', 'bar');
[09:36:05] <cwatson> Sounds right. $('#foo').attr('key','value');
[09:37:19] <jwmann> cwatson: Or would that just 'set' that value?
[09:37:45] <sacho> jwmann, $().attr('myattr') === 'something'
[09:38:35] <cwatson> You're right, it would just set it.
[09:39:02] <cwatson> Didn't know you were comparing. My bad.
[09:40:24] <jwmann> I basically want to set an attar if a specific attar already exists $(self).children('a').attr('data-menu-position') ==='foobar'
[09:42:24] <jwmann> Maybe something like this? $(self).children('a[data-menu-position='foobar']').attr('href', '#');
[09:53:45] <Bloomberg> Guys}11
[09:53:46] <Bloomberg> !!
[10:10:40] <BillCriswell> !!!
[10:13:42] <jo_> What? What?
[10:15:30] <utroda> Anyone know how to keep the keyup from firing if the form was submitted? - http://jsbin.com/aqikew/3/
[10:19:25] <clov3r> http://jsbin.com/aqikew/4/edit
[10:19:33] <clov3r> utroda ^
[10:20:54] <BillCriswell> Hmmm...
[10:27:38] <MobCat> is there a way to store elements in a class so you can loop through them later
[10:27:46] <MobCat> they don't have ID's only a class name
[10:28:17] <ftj> MobCat: $('.className').each(function() { // Do what you want here });
[10:28:17] <BillCriswell> MobCat: var $alerts = $('.alerts); could work.
[10:28:34] <ftj> MobCat: Ah yeah, later, do what BillCriswell says.
[10:28:56] <MobCat> I'm already .eaching I'm trying to store what I've gone over in the loop so far so I can re-loop through a limited set
[10:29:10] <MobCat> as a way of re-winding the loop
[10:29:32] <ftj> MobCat: You could create an empty array before the loop, .push to it the elements in the loop you'd like to save
[10:29:40] <ftj> Then loop through the new array afterwards
[10:29:55] <MobCat> that's what I tried with .push($(this));
[10:30:06] <ftj> and? didn't work?
[10:30:14] <MobCat> then when I for (var i in images) { the i doesn't work like i.hide
[10:30:25] <MobCat> Uncaught TypeError: Object 0 has no method 'hide'
[10:30:29] <clov3r> var $collection = new Array(); $('.className').each(function() { if(condition) { $collection.push($(this)) });
[10:30:46] <clov3r> or maybe not :P
[10:31:26] <MobCat> I tried that just now and got same error
[10:31:39] <utroda> clov3r: thanks man that works
[10:31:40] <ftj> MobCat: Try logging i to the console. What does it show in there?
[10:31:59] <MobCat> I guess instead of trying to rewind the loop I could do 1 .each loop first collect my rule set then run a second loop where I do the work
[10:32:02] <clov3r> utroda: np
[10:32:12] <MobCat> instead of trying to rewind it to do work
[10:32:40] <clov3r> mobcat: or try var $collection = $(); $('.className').each(function() { if(condition) { $collection.add($(this)) });
[10:33:02] <clov3r> using a jquery object instead of an array, and .add instead of .push
[10:33:16] <BillCriswell> .filter() might be better for that.
[10:34:01] <BillCriswell> utroda: You could do $(this).off('keyup'); if the event type is a submit since it appears to happens first. This seems fun though I want to mess around with it more lol.
[10:35:05] <BillCriswell> var $collection = $('.alerts').filter(':is(.error)');
[10:35:34] <utroda> BillCriswell: go for it! it would be nice to find a lighter solution
[10:37:18] <BillCriswell> ursasmar: http://jsbin.com/aqikew/7/edit This is what I was thinking?
[10:38:54] <MobCat> thx clov3r that worked
[10:39:35] <webaholic> Morning/afternoon. http://jsfiddle.net/wTGrZ/  Assuming the right screen resolution, this is meant to be a 2 x 2 horizontal list grid. I'm trying to make it so that when I click on a show stuff button, only that column expands down instead of every row below the box containing said button. Which of my JS/CSS needs changing?
[10:40:16] <Nicolas_Leonidas> hi, is it possible to POST using JSONP, and be able to retrieve the results?
[10:40:28] <ftj> Nicolas_Leonidas: Nope. JSONP is GET only.
[10:40:31] <clov3r> webaholic: probably needs absolute positioning
[10:40:48] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ftj: so If I wanna post something to another domain and get the results I'm screwed?
[10:41:07] <BillCriswell> webaholic: What clover said, sadly. =/
[10:41:10] <webaholic> clov3r: the actual app contains...well, the amount of boxes depends on the data set. unsure how to apply absolute positioning in that regard.
[10:41:28] <BillCriswell> webaholic: Would need to use masonry or something?
[10:41:29] <ftj> Nicolas_Leonidas: As far as I know, yeah. You could run a little proxy backend script on your server and finagle it that way, I think, but I haven't tried that.
[10:42:03] <webaholic> BillCriswell: unfamiliar with masonry. Guessing it has to do with building stuff.
[10:42:13] <BillCriswell> Oh you're good!
[10:42:15] <ftj> Nicolas_Leonidas: Basically, your script (on your domain) would receive the POST values, send them on through, then pass back the result to your JS.
[10:42:26] <BillCriswell> webaholic: http://masonry.desandro.com/demos/basic-single-column.html
[10:42:32] <webaholic> okay, slight sarcasm aside...what is masonry in this--thank you
[10:42:40] <clov3r> webaholic: http://jsfiddle.net/wTGrZ/1/
[10:42:50] <clov3r> all it needs is absolute positioning on the aside
[10:43:00] <BillCriswell> I assumed he wanted it to push down lol.
[10:43:08] <clov3r> (if i've understood your goal tho)
[10:44:02] <webaholic> clov3r: I was kind of hoping to push all of the column down, but...this could possibly work as well. may have to run it through my boss.
[10:44:08] <clov3r> ah right
[10:44:23] <clov3r> then i agree with bill, masonry
[10:44:45] <clov3r> masonry is a js plugin that helps you float divs in columns... without fixed row heights
[10:45:02] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it'll need to be refreshed  when the box comes down though.. which is kind of unfun.
[10:45:20] <BillCriswell> refresh as in masonry, not the window.
[10:45:50] <clov3r> or you could just add a function to increase the margin-top of the box below by the height of the aside
[10:46:16] <webaholic> I'd also have to check if adding masonry is allowed. kind of strict in terms of what's allowed or not (I still have to support IE-7 after all)
[10:46:22] <BillCriswell> Hmm.. wonder what I could accomplish with wrap() and unwrap() on a window resize.
[10:46:49] <BillCriswell> webaholic: I think masonry supports ie7
[10:48:33] <webaholic> I may have to try this out in my off time
[10:48:54] <BillCriswell> Masonry or wrap and unwrap?
[10:49:56] <webaholic> ...didn't see the wrap or unwrap stuff
[10:50:01] <webaholic> but both in this case
[10:51:31] <BillCriswell> wondering if on window resize you can just $boxes.slice(0, 5).wrapAll('<div class="col"/>'); and float them.
[10:52:27] <BillCriswell> The order of things will be weird I'm sure. :-/
[10:57:23] <MobCat> is it impossible to .each inside a .each?
[10:57:32] <MobCat> I called $(this) in my second each but it goes to the parent
[10:58:32] <webaholic> MobCat: for both eaches, did you try to include both the index and (alt to "this") parameters?
[11:03:55] <awc737> does anyone know a good jQ 1.6 compatible image slider?
[11:13:01] <b-lew> I have an anchor link and I can change the css once its been clicked on but its a nav item and once you click on it from another page the css no long applies. Is there a way to fix this? here is the code i'm working with. http://pastie.org/7725451
[11:15:35] <madprops> is there any way to like put a div where another div was in place and put the older div inside the new div?
[11:15:49] <b-lew> huh?
[11:16:17] <b-lew> I don't think I've ever had to do that beore
[11:16:18] <b-lew> before
[11:16:39] <madprops> i'm creating some sort of containers of divs
[11:17:03] <madprops> and when i split a div in two i want to create two containers and put each div inside each container which should go side by side
[11:18:46] <madprops> there's a replaceWith method nice
[11:19:00] <joelsemar> hey guys, trying to get started with jquery mobile, can't figure out how to cause the framework to enhance widgets dynamicaly, for example here: http://dpaste.org/9pjhE/ "addTest()" fails (adds a vanilla <li>
[11:19:37] <joelsemar> adding content on pagebeforecreate works
[11:19:59] <clov3r> b-lew, have you considered the a:visited css?
[11:20:59] <FoolsRun> Hi, I'm having some trouble. I need to pass a variable to jQuery UI's accordion activate. I have this: $('#accordionFAQ').accordion({ active: hash });  and it doesn't work. ("hash" is set elsewhere and shows the correct value when I do alert(hash);
[11:21:29] <FoolsRun> active: 3 works fine
[11:23:39] <clov3r> hash probably is returning a string
[11:23:52] <clov3r> try parseInt or toInt on it
[11:25:05] <medden> hi, could anyone please spare a minute to look at some code to help me see why its not working.... been trying for 5 hours and im close to giving up.
[11:25:56] <FoolsRun> clov3r: is there a function that can tell me whether it's a string or an int?
[11:26:10] <clov3r> probably
[11:26:16] <clov3r> google
[11:26:18] <clov3r> :)
[11:26:28] <awc737> does anyone know a image slider which lets you specify a directory?
[11:26:43] <clov3r> medden: what's the code
[11:27:01] <medden> ok to post link to the site?
[11:27:09] <BillCriswell> awc737: Most slideshows don't worry about things at that level.
[11:27:31] <clov3r> awc737 i just wrote a couple of lines of php and jquery to do that tho
[11:27:42] <clov3r> can give em to you if you want
[11:27:45] <clov3r> nothing hard ;)
[11:27:47] <awc737> BillCriswell, what do you mean don't worry about things at that level?
[11:27:58] <clov3r> medden: sure
[11:28:03] <clov3r> you can /msg me if you want
[11:28:19] <awc737> I just want one such as: $('.slider').jquerySlider({'path': '/img/slider1', etc
[11:28:35] <awc737> how is that something slideshows don't worry about? they either have it or don't
[11:28:58] <FoolsRun> I think the problem is that jquery isn't evaluating the variable and is trying to use the word "hash"
[11:29:13] <BillCriswell> Ok... in that case I don't know of a slideshow that lets you specify a path for the imaegs.
[11:29:27] <FoolsRun> check that, clov3r you were right. Thanks!!
[11:29:34] <awc737> clov3r, what slideshow did you use?
[11:29:44] <FoolsRun> clov3r: I've been struggling with that for more than an hour. I really appreciate it.
[11:30:44] <b-lew> Hey Guys, I have this code… http://pastie.org/7725472 -> which is working fine but its a navigation item so when I click on the link from another page then the css doesn't seem to apply to the .menu-item-141 but it works if I click on the link when I'm on the same page as the anchor. I hope that makes sense
[11:30:44] <b-lew> is there a way to make it change the css after its click on from a different page
[11:30:48] <nicetry> Is it possible for jquery to trigger a click - wherever the mouse is?
[11:31:34] <awc737> clov3r, why was PHP necessary?
[11:31:42] <BillCriswell> nicetry: Sure thing.
[11:31:49] <nicetry> a silly example being: I hover over an area for more than 5 seconds and then jquery makes a click happen in the exact spot my mouse is at the end of the 5 seconds?
[11:32:17] <sacho> nicetry, use the mouseover event to store the element to click
[11:32:20] <BillCriswell> Triggering the exact spot might be tricky... but triggering the click on something is easy enough.
[11:32:33] <nicetry> BillCriswell: sacho I can't do that
[11:32:36] <clov3r> awc737: http://dpaste.org/ocuPa/
[11:32:40] <nicetry> Thats the problem
[11:32:46] <clov3r> jquery has trouble getting a directory listing
[11:32:46] <sacho> why?
[11:32:51] <awc737> oh it does
[11:33:04] <nicetry> The place where I eventually have to trigger a click occurs in an iframe which does not contain jquery (to my knowledge)
[11:33:12] * nicetry is working with tinymce :c
[11:33:16] <sacho> who said you have to use jquery?
[11:33:28] <awc737> does JS have trouble with dir listing?
[11:33:28] <clov3r> the php here scans a directory for filenames in a wordpress blog in images with filename: HomeSlider*.*
[11:33:35] <awc737> and clov3r what slider did you use
[11:33:39] <BillCriswell> setTimeout(function(){ el.trigger('click'); }, 5000);
[11:34:00] <nicetry> sacho: I guess my boss? but its not 100% necessary if there is a better way
[11:34:01] <clov3r> awc737 just wrote a simple function myself
[11:34:01] <BillCriswell> clear it n mouseout
[11:34:08] <nicetry> BillCriswell: What is el ?
[11:34:23] <awc737> clov3r, jquery ui effects?
[11:34:27] <BillCriswell> just an example element.
[11:34:43] <clov3r> sure you can use that
[11:35:02] <clov3r> the jquery code just populates an array with the file urls of the images to use
[11:35:03] <nicetry> sacho: What did you have in mind?
[11:35:18] <clov3r> and then you can use that with UI
[11:35:23] <sacho> nicetry, you can implement a mouseover listener and eventual click in the iframe
[11:36:06] <nicetry> sacho: interesting - go intot he iframe and add a mouseover listener?
[11:37:17] <BillCriswell> nicetry: http://jsbin.com/uhewaj/1/edit
[11:37:20] <BillCriswell> Probably way late.
[11:38:12] <nicetry> BillCriswell: Thanks for that - the only thing is that I can't do "$('div').on"
[11:40:14] <darkmutt> http://jsfiddle.net/LcCKb/
[11:40:34] <darkmutt> did i mess something up when making the accordion cause there's an error appearing in there :/
[11:42:11] <BillCriswell> darkmutt: DId you include jquery-ui?
[11:42:32] <darkmutt> yep unless the link on jqueryi.com is incorrect
[11:43:40] <BillCriswell> I can never spell accordion right the first try.
[11:44:11] <BillCriswell> darkmutt: It just seems like UI never made it through, at least the accodian part of it.
[11:44:14] <BillCriswell> accordion*
[11:44:32] <nicetry> ekkurbiom
[11:44:44] <BillCriswell> Close enough.
[11:44:56] <nicetry> Now your spelling doesn't look half so bad, no?
[11:45:03] <BillCriswell> a-cord-e-yun
[11:46:57] <darkmutt> thanks BillCriswell but i tried all three links to the same response changing it from class to id didn't do anything either :/;
[11:48:13] <Sna4x8> darkmutt: I think it's your header
[11:48:30] <Sna4x8> http://jsfiddle.net/LcCKb/2/
[11:48:54] <Sna4x8> ^^ I removed the head and body, and included jquery/jquery-ui in the fiddle options.
[11:49:28] <MobCat> does anyone know a jquery plugin that could fill a div with images in a liquid design?
[11:49:30] <BillCriswell> The </link> seems weird.
[11:49:38] <BillCriswell> MobCat: Masonry.
[11:49:51] <MobCat> where the image's have differing widths
[11:49:56] <MobCat> Masonry requires fixed widths
[11:50:11] <BillCriswell> MobCat: http://masonry.desandro.com/demos/images.html
[11:50:30] <MobCat> the widths are fixed
[11:50:59] <MobCat> http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=images&FORM=HDRSC2
[11:51:18] <MobCat> this is an example of some type of JS that is doing width adjustments for images
[11:51:30] <MobCat> the guy who runs masonry told me he has no plans to make that work
[11:51:35] <MobCat> ;_;
[11:51:57] <BillCriswell> MobCat: http://masonry.desandro.com/demos/basic-multi-column.html ?
[11:52:16] <MobCat> those don't fill up the container there's a gap at the end
[11:53:41] <BillCriswell> MobCat: The images are cropped on the bing search results.
[11:54:08] <BillCriswell> Which makes your task a bit easier.
[11:54:10] <nicetry> For prosperity - I think I found part of my solution http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6128791/jquery-javascript-detect-click-event-inside-tinymce
[11:54:15] <trovster> I am making a JSON AJAX request and throwing an error which is returning JSON. What is the correct method to get that data (correctly formatted as JSON) ?
[11:56:00] <MobCat> bing isn't cropping them
[11:56:09] <darkmutt> thanks you Sna4x8 though it's still working weirdly but ill figure somethin out :D
[11:56:37] <BillCriswell> MobCat: It absolutely is.
[11:56:45] <MobCat> which image in that link
[11:57:28] <BillCriswell> The waterfall.
[11:57:34] <BillCriswell> Or brook.
[11:57:39] <MobCat> you're talking about the image when you put your mouse over?
[11:57:44] <MobCat> and it shows a larger version
[11:57:44] <Sna4x8> darkmutt: Yea, it seems weird.  At any rate, that seemed like the reason the accordion wasn't getting initialized.  "header" uses .find().
[11:57:47] <MobCat> and you see lots more that isn't in the picture
[11:58:06] <BillCriswell> That would be cropping?
[11:58:11] <MobCat> no that's the original image
[11:58:39] <MobCat> it's not being CSS cropped
[11:58:43] <MobCat> the thumbnail is already cropped server side
[11:58:47] <BillCriswell> But the images in the grid view are.
[11:58:53] <BillCriswell> Which is what I thought was the focus.
[11:59:05] <MobCat> hmm I guess the server is just cropping the images dynmically
[11:59:13] <MobCat> similar to google+
[11:59:28] <MobCat> on the server side
[11:59:35] <BillCriswell> MobCat: Yup.
[11:59:59] <MobCat> you can do that with CSS tho, it's just I wish someone had made a plugin for this
[12:00:07] <zoinky> i see .on() has replaced .live(), but .on() doesn't seem to detect newly added elements to the DOM?
[12:00:12] <BillCriswell> http://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?id=H.4917764278976937&pid=1.7&w=254&h=180&c=7&rs=1 vs http://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?id=H.4917764278976937&pid=1.7&w=254&h=880&c=7&rs=1
[12:00:38] <`RobW> zoinky: proof of concept?
[12:01:09] <zoinky> is on supposed to be detecting newly added elements?
[12:01:21] <zoinky> im using 1.9.1
[12:01:24] <MobCat> if I could server side crop then I could just use masonry
[12:02:25] <`RobW> sec
[12:03:03] <royalty> would if ($("#element")) check if the element exists?
[12:03:22] <BillCriswell> Why not CSS overflow?
[12:03:46] <BillCriswell> royalty: $('#element').length wouldbe more boolish.
[12:03:54] <MobCat> I'm gonna try a few things
[12:04:09] <MobCat> CSS could work I just gotta figure out how to distribute the end gap to all the images
[12:04:29] <royalty> BillCriswell: okay
[12:04:32] <zoinky> `RobW: I have pasted the code into the Console after the new elements have been added, then tried to click one of the new links and it worked.  so .on() definitely isn't picking up newly added elements
[12:07:14] <zoinky> ill just have to change it to looking for hash changes. but thats annoying -_-
[12:09:41] <`RobW> zoinky: http://jsfiddle.net/zaaxw/
[12:10:17] <`RobW> this WON'T work: http://jsfiddle.net/zaaxw/1/
[12:10:23] <`RobW> take note line 7
[12:11:33] <joelsemar> anyone here realy familiar with jquery mobile?
[12:12:06] <joelsemar>  can't figure out how to cause the framework to enhance widgets dynamically, for example here: http://dpaste.org/9pjhE/ "addTest()" fails (adds a vanilla <li>)
[12:12:38] <joelsemar> I can only seem to modify on pagebeforecreate
[12:13:06] <cwatson> Can anyone show me what I'm doing wrong? - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77127384/contentSlider2/index.html
[12:13:48] <sacho> what makes you think you're doing something wrong?
[12:14:35] <cwatson> It's not working as I thought it would intend to.
[12:14:58] <cwatson> I want to make an image slider (previous and next image) ideally.
[12:15:41] <zoinky> `RobW: my scenario is that I have a page that is pulling in new content via ajax, that content has a link that could pull in more content, but on() doesn't know those new links so doesn't care if they are clicked.  it be like if your example brought in new buttons that could do the same function as your first button.  is this not possible with .on()?
[12:16:11] <sacho> cwatson, what do the .prev() and .next() functions do?
[12:16:32] <cwatson> sacho: Go to the next element
[12:16:43] <cwatson> and prev element
[12:16:49] <sacho> "go"? how do they "go" to it?
[12:17:11] <cwatson> It selects that element in the doc tree.
[12:17:30] <sacho> and what makes you think selecting an element would cause a visible change?
[12:17:43] <`RobW> zoinky: look closely at the example
[12:17:50] <cwatson> Good question. I feel fucking stupid.
[12:17:54] <`RobW> if you provide the parent container, then 2nd argument as a child element ("A" for example), it should be ok
[12:18:13] <sacho> cwatson, also
[12:18:32] <sacho> $('#imgSlide img').next() - when will this return different elements?
[12:19:13] <clh_> anyone know if there is a theme roller firefox bookmarklet that still works with the latest jquery UI ?
[12:19:14] <sacho> you could use a counter, or hold the current elements
[12:19:21] <sacho> (using .prev and .next)
[12:19:33] <sacho> then add some shows and hides, and you have what you need in a basic sense.
[12:19:33] <cwatson> Why would it return different elements? All it's doing is selecting the second img tag.
[12:19:49] <cwatson> And doing nothing with it.
[12:19:54] <cwatson> Like you said.
[12:20:00] <sacho> exactly
[12:20:10] <sacho> it's always selecting the second image tag :)
[12:20:11] <cwatson> I'll try the counter thing.
[12:20:27] <zoinky> `RobW: http://jsfiddle.net/zaaxw/6/, so something like this isnt possible?
[12:20:44] <cwatson> sacho: Right, I appreciate you helping me. My brain feels dead for some reason.
[12:20:49] <darkmutt> ehhh i don't get this accordion completely even with the docs in my face gonna search for a tut XD
[12:20:50] <cwatson> lol
[12:22:05] <darkmutt> or wait i do but still wanna change some thing :D thanks for help earlier everyone and have fun :D
[12:24:50] <aphpperson> I'm trying to build something that works as a div slider.  I could have many divs with content on them.. but only 1 is visible.  When I hit the next arrow (or whatever) it slides in another div which is now the only visible div.  Can anyone help me / point me in the right direction?
[12:25:15] <aphpperson> or fades in.. out.. whatever is easy to do
[12:25:17] <BillCriswell> aphpperson: FlexSlider seems to be what the kids love these days.
[12:27:08] <aphpperson> that looks like alot of code / extras.  I was really looking for a programmatic solution so that I could put something very lightweight on my site.  I didnt know if jQuery had some inherent functions to do what I'm talking aboot
[12:27:14] <zoinky> `RobW: forget the last link, i mean something like http://jsfiddle.net/zaaxw/7/ isnt possible? where you can add more buttons that allow you to add more buttons?
[12:27:19] <`RobW> zoinky: let me check, sorry was afk
[12:27:45] <aphpperson> like a (#thiscurrentdiv).showhtmlfrom(#thishiddendiv).slidethatshitin()
[12:28:03] <`RobW> zoinky: that btn has the same id
[12:28:08] <`RobW> change all btns to have classes instead.
[12:28:20] <zoinky> I did
[12:28:25] <zoinky> i just didnt take out id's
[12:32:32] <`RobW> zoinky: http://jsfiddle.net/zaaxw/9/
[12:36:10] <zoinky> ah i see, thanks!
[12:36:17] <vasundhar> /join #learnjavascript
[12:36:20] <zoinky> i'll try this out, ill let you know how it goes
[12:38:16] <horrror> hi guys does anybody have en experience with Redactor?
[12:38:22] <`RobW> zoinky: basically, make $(document).on(<trigger>, <selector>, <function>)
[12:39:49] <zoinky> yeah i get how it works, makes sense
[12:39:56] <zoinky> it worked too, thanks! that was such a head ache
[12:40:48] <zoinky> is calling on() on an element a bad idea then?
[12:42:09] <dcherman> zoinky: no.  event delegation is not always the right answer.  it depends on your situation
[13:03:49] <velts> anyone know what the "a is null" error is all about?
[13:04:38] <jo_> @velts, what's the context?
[13:04:57] <jo_> Are you getting that with a pure include of jQuery?
[13:42:23] <eshlox> http://wklej.org/id/1023463/ hm, why first shows up console.log(comments_html); (empty value) and then all console.log(Mustache.to_html(comments_template, value)); with correct value? how to fix that?
[13:44:47] <BillCriswell> eshlox: You're not waiting for the get request to finish.
[13:45:12] <BillCriswell> When you do $.get just because something comes on the lines after it doesn't mean it'll run in that order.
[13:46:08] <BillCriswell> eshlox: In other works, but it in $.get's callback..
[13:46:12] <BillCriswell> words*
[13:46:26] <clov3r> *put
[13:47:24] <eshlox> BillCriswell: ok, thanks ;-)
[13:48:42] <Areckx> I am having trouble with position elements, whenever I try to reposition elements, they get cut off.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16244912/nivo-slider-css-positioning-cut-off
[13:50:29] <clov3r> either remove overflow:hidden on the slider, or change bottom: 0px on nivo-caption
[13:50:59] <clov3r> and right: 0px on nivo-nextNav
[13:51:15] <clov3r> it's those negative absolute positions that's doing it
[13:52:21] <jbwiv> guys, I'm sure I'm misunderstanding the scoping at play here, but in this code (http://jsfiddle.net/7NqUf/), shouldn't preview_enabled (line 2) be visible at other points within these functions? (line 14, 18 and 36)? in my testing, it's not
[13:52:34] <jbwiv> although I think it should be based on the scoping of the function
[13:55:27] <dcherman> jbwiv: yes, it's in scope
[13:57:14] <serversides> Can anyone please tell me why I am getting the data back here as 'UNDEFINED'? http://jsfiddle.net/seversides/G7Wr8/
[13:57:24] <jbwiv> dcherman: and yet when I reference it in the setInterval function, i get "Exception: ReferenceError: preview_enabled is not defined"
[13:58:21] <dcherman> jbwiv: might have something to do with the fact that "and" should be "&&"
[13:59:03] <BillCriswell> eshlox: Welcome.
[13:59:13] <jbwiv> dcherman: heh...yes. ruby to javascript problem in my head. still, fixing that, I still get the reference error
[14:00:28] <chrisvInNYC> @serverside:  alerts array has 0 elements
[14:02:31] <dcherman> jbwiv: if you can post working code on jsfiddle that demonstrates the problem, i'm sure someone could help you out
[14:03:14] <dcherman> a reduced test case demonstrating the problem is preferable
[14:03:39] <jbwiv> dcherman: yes, agreed. that'll take a bit of work, but i"ll do it
[14:04:36] <chrisvInNYC> @serverside:  have you tested your ajax method with success and error methods to see what is happening?
[14:05:48] <serversides> @chrisvInNYC:  Ah so it doesn't.  Thats very starnge.  I have not tested th ajax yet with success and error methods.  I shall do that now.  The data im getting is severe weather alerts in europe for a location.  Only prob is im changing the location to one which has some data for me to test
[14:08:58] <chrisvInNYC> @serverside:  ok, that makes sense. yeah i looked at "data" in console and saw nothing.  you may want to handle undefined or array.length==0 values so things are easier to debug
[14:13:27] <MobCat> I'm doing .each and I can do $(this).next to select next element before it comes up
[14:13:29] <MobCat> except for the first item
[14:13:35] <MobCat> is that a bug?
[14:14:38] <MobCat> nvm I think I have a bug
[14:18:19] <jbwiv> dcherman: check it now: http://jsfiddle.net/7NqUf/2/
[14:18:35] <jbwiv> wow, damn it, never mind
[14:18:59] <jbwiv> dcherman: forget I said anything. that's showing the scope working. obviously something in my code. thanks for the help
[14:24:36] <maxmoore14> I must be losing my mind... can someone tell me why this simple test doesn't work? http://jsbin.com/enapog/1/edit
[14:26:28] <maxmoore14> anyone still working? or is it beer-o-clock?
[14:26:48] <maxmoore14> can't figure out why pageload is not firing... http://jsbin.com/enapog/1/edit
[14:31:15] <maxmoore14> never mind... I'm an idiot
[14:35:38] <Blaster> hey I have some code with a selector like $('tr.index',ui.item.parent())....  but I am not sure how that works or what it's for.  Why is it separated by comma?  Can anyone link to the man page for that?
[14:35:57] <sacho> Blaster, because it's a second parameter to the jquery function.
[14:36:14] <Blaster> what does it do?
[14:36:38] <Blaster> $('tr.index',ui.item.parent()).each(function(i)....);
[14:36:56] <sacho> you could look at the documentation for the jquery function. It gives a context to search in.
[14:37:24] <Blaster> oh ok
[14:37:25] <Blaster> thank you
[15:01:28] <MobCat> thx for the help clov3r and BillCriswell, I got a script that filled a div with images like bing does =P
[15:01:33] <MobCat> made*
[15:02:11] <MobCat> I loop once, look at next object, collect a row of images in a jquery object then loop that twice
[15:02:17] <MobCat> hope that isn't bad =P
[15:03:26] <clov3r> is it live? let me see what you built? :)
[15:04:05] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i'm having some problems to make a jquery plugin textext work. I'm using jquery for other stuff already... How can i check what's the actual problem
[15:04:06] <Krambiorix> ?
[15:04:40] <clov3r> @ karmbiorix: extensive time & testing
[15:04:41] <clov3r> :P
[15:04:56] <clov3r> but posting some code snippets in pastebin might help ;)
[15:05:01] <cwatson> Anyone know how to get rid of the white space between clicking next and back? - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77127384/contentSlider2/index.html
[15:05:34] <MobCat> sure I'll send you a demo in a few minutes doing a quick stress test
[15:08:11] <Jon47> cwatson - either float the elements left or delete the whitespace between the tags in the html
[15:08:23] <Jon47> they are inline so whitespace is rendered
[15:08:51] <Jon47> not really a jquery question though ;)
[15:08:56] <Krambiorix> clov3r, http://jsfiddle.net/SZhfR/
[15:09:12] <cwatson> True, my bad.
[15:11:04] <clov3r> krambiorix: no idea, never heard of textext
[15:11:19] <cwatson> Jon47: Still not working. Oh, well. Thank you for the help.
[15:11:45] <sifu> what am i doing wrong here that nothing happens: http://jsbin.com/esiyoj/6/edit
[15:12:47] <clov3r> sifu: either div span.add or div input.addopt
[15:12:55] <sifu> hmm
[15:13:00] <sacho> There's no span with the class addopt.
[15:13:15] <sacho> sifu, next time, use your browser's debugging tools and check the length of the jquery collection.
[15:13:31] <sifu> length of jquery collection
[15:13:33] <Krambiorix> clov3r, i think it's jquery conflict problem... But i don't get any errors....
[15:13:47] <sifu> i did use and there was no error
[15:14:10] <sacho> sifu, sorry, what?
[15:14:26] <sifu> <sacho> sifu, next time, use your browser's debugging tools and check the length of the jquery collection.
[15:14:33] <sifu> check the length of the jquery collection.
[15:14:44] <sacho> if you had done that, you'd see it's 0.
[15:15:00] <sifu> sorry but how would i have done that...
[15:15:11] <sacho> $().length
[15:15:17] <sifu> i went to console to see if anything worked...white screen
[15:15:31] <sifu> the div within the parantheses?
[15:15:42] <sacho> yes
[15:15:52] <sifu> ohh okey
[15:15:54] <sifu> thanks
[15:16:15] <sifu> clov3r, will try that thanks..
[15:44:41] <crack_head> any way for me to get access to this variable: http://pastie.org/7726794
[15:45:03] <crack_head> outside of this function that is
[15:45:41] <rainabba> An ajax call is returning a dynamically generated iFrame that's getting added to the DOM. That iFrame includes <script src> blocks and one of those calls $(document).ready() but it's not firing in IE. I've been googling and only finding very nasty looking hacks and I suspect theres a much safer way to go about this. The same code works as expected in Chrome. Suggestions?
[15:46:57] <crack_head> hmm...can people read my message?
[15:47:39] <rainabba> return userRegApp;
[15:48:14] <rainabba> Kinda programming 101. That's why you're not getting any attention.
[15:49:17] <rainabba> $j(function() {}) seems odd. What's that about?
[15:49:56] <rainabba> Hell, why even use a function to return the results of a function like that anyway if you're not going to do anything to them? Just call TestObj() where you need the results.
[15:53:19] <sifu> pheww stuck again...how would i change the span individually when the checkbox is checked? i read sth like event delegation but not really understood it yet? http://jsbin.com/esiyoj/6/edit
[15:54:54] <rainabba> sifu: With your current code, your spans can't be reliably changed individually from just anywhere though you could use a selector that found nextSibling('span") or something along those lines (relative to 'this' in click() handler).
[15:55:38] <sifu> rainabba, hmm so what would be a better approach then...any suggestions will be helpful
[15:55:45] <rainabba> class is used to identify types. id is used to identify individuals. You don't have any ids which is ok since you're really dealing with labels, but for that matter, you might want to look at actually using <label>
[15:56:42] <rainabba> Also, on('click') the way you're using it is the same as just click().
[15:57:06] <rainabba> 'div input.addopt' is unneccessary too since the 'div' is irrelevant. Just use 'input.addopt'
[15:57:15] <crack_head> rainabba : I'm just trying to show a really simple example
[15:57:25] <sifu> hmm okey
[15:57:28] <rainabba> or just '.addopt' if you're not going to use that class on anything but those inputs
[15:57:30] <crack_head> that variable is in a lib that someone wrote
[15:57:59] <crack_head> rainabba : ..so I don't really have the ability to change it. But I'd like to access that variable
[15:58:19] <rainabba> crack_head: If you can't change the library, then there's nothing you can do since that function doesn't return the value you want.
[15:59:04] <crack_head> rainabba : I believe the $j is for no-conflict http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[15:59:08] <rainabba> crack_head: That question has nothing to do with jQuery by the way and would be better asked in #javascript as a result.
[16:00:02] <rainabba> sifu: http://api.jquery.com/next/
[16:00:04] <crack_head> right...but it's using the jquery library...so I'm not sure there isn't a jquery way of getting access to that variable
[16:00:19] <sifu> rainabba, thanks will have a look
[16:04:11] <sifu> rainabba, thank you
[16:04:17] <sifu> can't believe i managed to get it worked
[16:07:06] <rainabba> sifu: Here's how I'd do it without changing anything in your page: http://jsfiddle.net/maECF/
[16:07:27] <rainabba> Don't forget to change the value of each input though (they're all 1 right now).
[16:07:45] <sifu> thank you once more
[16:07:55] <rainabba> welcome
[16:08:03] <sifu> will study the way you did and try to understand it before i use it
[16:08:41] <rainabba> If could be made more readable by storing $(this).next('.add') in a variable.
[16:08:53] <sifu> ohh okey
[16:11:06] <sifu> rainabba, one unrelated question...is there a way i could use jquery to inject some css on an iframe body (iframe is from the same source)...
[16:12:32] <rainabba> Try: $("#iFrame").contents().find("#someDiv") from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/364952/jquery-javascript-accessing-contents-of-an-iframe
[16:12:42] <rainabba> MUST be the same domain (which you seem to be aware of).
[16:12:48] <sifu> thank you...will give that a go to...
[16:13:00] <rainabba> GoogleFoo strikes again!

[16:56:22] <myndzi> 'on' can do what' bind' does

[17:30:52] <whomp> how can i count the number of images in an embedded iframe from another site?
[17:32:56] <whomp> when i call $('iframe').contents(), it gives me the error message: "The frame requesting access has a protocol of 'http', the frame being accessed has a protocol of 'https'. Protocols must match."
[17:33:07] <whomp> short of converting my site to https, i'm not sure what to do
[20:26:53] <YammYcoding> guys, i added in a tag this: productid="1".  How can i select this?
[20:27:19] <YammYcoding> it's a custom attribute i think
[20:27:23] <`RobW> you need to prefix it
[20:27:28] <YammYcoding> with what?
[20:27:30] <`RobW> it's an html attribute right?
[20:27:35] <`RobW> like <div productid="1"> ?
[20:27:49] <`RobW> prefix it with data-
[20:27:50] <YammYcoding> it's in a custom tag, <tableview pid=1>
[20:27:51] <screamingbanshee> data-productid
[20:27:53] <`RobW> oh
[20:28:00] <YammYcoding> zepto thing
[20:28:28] <YammYcoding> what the name of this data selection thing for i search a similar in zepto?
[20:29:07] <screamingbanshee> $("tableview").data("pid")
[20:29:25] <screamingbanshee> if  you did data-pid
[20:29:44] <YammYcoding> ah okey
[20:29:52] <YammYcoding> i guess zepto is the same :)
[20:31:22] <YammYcoding> it's right? $('tableview').data('productid'+product.id).find('.values').append( amountselect );
[20:31:53] <YammYcoding> i set that data-productid="1"
[20:32:03] <YammYcoding> i need to filter by the id too
[20:33:01] <screamingbanshee> ok
[20:33:22] <screamingbanshee> $("tableview#id").data("pid")
[20:33:24] <screamingbanshee> or w/e
[20:33:45] <YammYcoding> i guess i did something very wrong :)
[20:33:46] <YammYcoding> http://yammy.com.br/phonegap/helloworld/
[20:33:47] <screamingbanshee> since id should be unique, you can just pull that
[20:33:51] <screamingbanshee> lol
[20:35:41] <ankurk_> Hey peeps, is it possible to draw something like this using jQuery? http://imgur.com/ZPpr5QO
[20:39:19] <ftj> ankurk_: You can do anything you like in JavaScript/jQuery, but tools for building flowcharts are not built in, if that's what you're asking
[20:39:53] <ftj> ankurk_: Better off looking at something like http://www.jgraph.com/mxgraph.html
[20:40:48] <ankurk_> I want the user to have ability to edit the nodes or delete them, it doesn't seem to have that
[20:41:53] <screamingbanshee> you could build it
[20:42:27] <screamingbanshee> ankurk_: but no, it's not ready-baked
[20:43:34] <ankurk_> I have been researching over this for a long time & I have not been able to find something viable
[20:50:36] <Foxhoundz> O_O
[20:57:13] <echoSMILE> I have a iframe inside a div, somehow is possible drag that div but clicking inside iframe? I already try the iframeFix, but nothing happen
[21:36:48] <adamsilver> hey guys, i have this code which is working for me but I need to have it restarted when the loop is finished indefinitely: http://bpaste.net/show/Uo8VzAzSkrDkUocN4HCN/ … How can I do that?
[21:46:22] <tw2113> adamsilver, i'd probably store the stuff you're currently looping over, aka .slide_sub, in a variable
[21:46:33] <tw2113> and then do a loop inside a loop
[21:47:11] <tw2113> where the outter loop is some variable you set up, and increment it on each iteration. Once it reaches a certain value, reset it back to 1 or so
[21:47:40] <tw2113> but as i stop to think why do you want this going on forever? it would probably crash your browser
[21:48:53] <adamsilver> tw2113: it's a slide show that I want to start it over when done
[21:48:55] <tw2113> do you mean more an "endless circle" where once you reach the last slide, it just iterates the original first slide and appends to the end
[21:49:18] <adamsilver> tw2113: yes..
[21:49:22] <tw2113> i know there are sliders out there that offer this as an option
[21:49:29] <tw2113> i'd check out how they do that
[21:55:05] <adamsilver> tw2113: ok thanks
[23:08:31] <andkore> .load(variable + " #content", function() { <-- how does the #content part affect the load operation? I get different behavior without it. But requesting the URL with or without it in a browser yields the same result
[23:14:05] <ravenzz> andkore that way it loads a page fragment
[23:14:32] <ravenzz> so you'll get a portion of the requested page
[23:14:44] <andkore> I realized that it did that, I just didn't understand how
[23:15:18] <ravenzz> Are you asking how jQuery does that?
[23:16:06] <andkore> well, it's obviously different from a regular HTTP request, right?
[23:16:18] <andkore> since, as I said, I get the same result with or without the # part in my browser
[23:16:47] <andkore> I don't have any anchors on my page
[23:16:58] <andkore> I just have a div with an id
[23:18:05] <ravenzz> andkore not really, it is a regular ajax request which later returns only what you asked for
[23:18:26] <andkore> ok. thanks
[23:18:40] <ravenzz> and insert it into the target element!
[23:18:41] <ravenzz> of course
[23:19:04] <ravenzz> $('#result').load("foo.html #content");
[23:19:38] <andkore> so the space doesn't matter?
[23:19:58] <andkore> oh god
[23:20:00] <andkore> there is a space
[23:20:03] <andkore> I feel stupid
[23:20:11] <ravenzz> yes it matters
[23:20:25] <andkore> ok, that's why I was confused. thanks a lot
[23:21:05] <ravenzz> "the portion of the string following the first space is assumed to be a jQuery selector that determines the content to be loaded" otherwise #content would be interpreted as the url fragment
[23:21:41] <ravenzz> andkore the documentation is there for you :P
[23:22:01] <andkore> yeah. if I had seen the space, I wouldn't have asked
[23:53:27] <antiPoP> Hi,
[23:53:40] <antiPoP> I have a variable, when I do
[23:54:06] <antiPoP> console.log(data['outcome']);
[23:54:31] <antiPoP> I get in the console:    aaa\r\nbbbb\r\n
[23:55:07] <antiPoP> then I do $.("#myTextarea").val(data['outcome'))
[23:55:27] <antiPoP> and in te text are it appears that string, but now newlines are created
[23:55:44] <antiPoP> why is happening this? how can I create newlines in the text area?
[23:56:50] <ravenzz> demo?
[23:58:17] <antiPoP> mmm
[23:58:44] <antiPoP> the data is gotten from json... let me upload somewhere...
[23:59:17] <ravenzz> jsfiddle
