[00:15:50] <aro> are there any decent plugins that will create sticky elements that work with bootstrap rows etc
[00:48:11] <aro> or better yet - a plugin that will make an element scroll to the next element and 'snap' to it
[00:50:19] <jak2000> tapout?
[01:05:12] <jak2000> WhirledPress hi
[01:05:18] <jak2000> are you there? wake up
[01:26:10] <WhirledPress> Hello?
[01:26:37] <jak2000> WhirledPress have time?
[01:26:54] <WhirledPress> a little, what's going on?
[01:27:15] <jak2000> follow me please
[01:27:28] <jak2000> cehck the sample 6: http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples
[01:27:31] <jak2000> *check please
[01:27:58] <WhirledPress> okay
[01:28:14] <jak2000> see Javascript code, please, https://github.com/markcell/jquery-tabledit/blob/master/jquery.tabledit.js  here code of the plugin
[01:28:32] <WhirledPress> okay...
[01:28:51] <jak2000> have 1 quiestin (i need modify the plugin) wher can evluate (or indicate) if a field is Date, and validate if is a date or a number?
[01:30:18] <WhirledPress> when do you want this to happen
[01:31:14] <jak2000> you undersstand the Javascript code?
[01:31:31] <WhirledPress> validation usually occurs on an event of some sort. Like when a field loses focus or before it is uploaded to a database...
[01:31:42] <jak2000> ok understand
[01:31:51] <WhirledPress> so when did you want to validate the data
[01:31:59] <jak2000> by sample
[01:32:06] <WhirledPress> that's not a when
[01:32:10] <jak2000> email field first reccord
[01:32:17] <WhirledPress> again, that's not a when
[01:32:20] <jak2000> how to validate if the email have an @ ?
[01:32:34] <WhirledPress> That's a how...I'm asking you to tell me WHEN to validate
[01:33:05] <WhirledPress> do you want to validate as the person is typing?
[01:33:10] <WhirledPress> after they are done typing?
[01:33:19] <WhirledPress> just before the submit to the database?
[01:33:25] <WhirledPress> after data is read from the database
[01:33:43] <WhirledPress> I could go on for about an hour with other times WHEN you might consider validating the field data
[01:33:49] <jak2000> on lost focus
[01:33:50] <jak2000> by sample
[01:34:40] <jak2000> lostfocus event
[01:36:55] <WhirledPress> it appears that they handle the change event on cell values
[01:39:12] <WhirledPress> It looks like you could inject some code around line 280 in the script...
[01:40:00] <WhirledPress> They check to see if the input field is a select element and grab the text of the option selected on submit. You could also check to see if the result was a date or number
[01:41:31] <aro> can you animate a selector using ::before/::after
[01:43:54] <WhirledPress> jak2000 it looks like you could also change the draw:editable event to check for a date or number and add the jqueryUI date picker or a number selector to the cell instead of a text input.
[01:44:04] <WhirledPress> line 140 ish
[01:48:28] <WhirledPress> But listen, dates can be a real pain in the ass if you go with localized versions of time/date. Everybody does it different...you'd be smarter to change your initialization object to include a "field type" parameter that allowed dates.
[01:49:02] <Cork> aro: you can in css, but not in js
[01:49:28] <Cork> so you can do it using css transition or css animate, but not with .animate()
[01:50:54] <WhirledPress> Any way you could look at a simple codepen that I am having problems with. I need to set an initial position of a section based on the "current" section...and it keeps messing up.
[01:51:03] <WhirledPress> http://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/yMLqdP
[01:51:44] <WhirledPress> The idea is that if you click a menu option below the "current" option, the page should slide up. It should slide down if the next section is above the current section.
[01:52:46] <WhirledPress> and rather than clicking on section 4 (from section 0) and making the viewer sick with rapidly scrolling content, I want to just place the selected section off the viewport and slide it in.
[01:54:23] <Cork> WhirledPress: i would prop do it by using scrollTop and a cover element
[01:54:48] <Cork> the problem with the solution you plan to use is that if js messes up the user is left with a completely useless page
[01:55:03] <Cork> if you use scroll offset, they can at least scroll
[01:55:13] <WhirledPress> Not really. It all appears in a big linear scrolling container then
[01:55:22] <Cork> ya
[01:55:29] <Cork> and?
[01:55:53] <WhirledPress> that doesn't solve the problem that I don't want to scroll past 30 pages to get to the next section
[01:56:01] <Cork> sure it does
[01:56:16] <Cork> just set the scroll offset to the top of the element + viewport height
[01:56:20] <Cork> add the cover screen
[01:56:31] <Cork> and animate scrollTop
[01:56:39] <Cork> when the animation is done remove the coverscreen
[01:57:00] <Cork> and you get a very similar effect to what you have, but with a fallback for the user IF it breaks
[01:57:32] <WhirledPress> seriously? that looks nothing like what mine looks like and mine already has the fallback if it breaks. the content will stay in order if js isn't working.
[01:57:50] <Cork> uh, i can't scroll that page at all
[01:57:57] <Cork> so no, you can't access anything if js breaks
[01:58:50] <WhirledPress> I removed the line where I reset the scroll properties in js to see if that was my problem
[02:01:33] <WhirledPress> So, you refuse to help me solve the problem the way I have it unless I choose to do it your way? I understand, it's frustrating. Thanks for taking a look at it. I'll figure it out.
[02:01:46] <WhirledPress> It works horizontally, just not vertically.
[02:02:02] <Cork> not refuce, i just leave it to someone wanting to play with that kind of solution
[02:02:02] <WhirledPress> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/oZNYVq
[02:02:06] <Cork> i have better things to do
[02:02:31] <WhirledPress> I understand. Thanks anyways.
[02:02:59] <aro> can you animate a selector using ::before/::after
[02:03:10] <Cork> aro: already answered that
[02:03:22] <aro> sorry i got booted
[02:03:26] <aro> i didnt see what was said :(
[02:03:54] <aro> is it possible?
[02:03:57] <Cork> so scroll up, you haven't left the channel since
[02:04:39] <aro> trust me my vpn dropped and i didnt get anything after whirledpress saying line 140ish
[02:05:30] <Cork> aro: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/latest.log.html
[02:05:35] <aro> ta
[02:06:00] <aro> so youyc ant do it with animate()
[02:06:02] <aro> how come?
[02:06:11] <aro> is it the style of the selector? oir what
[02:06:15] <Cork> cause those aren't elements
[02:06:18] <aro> ok
[02:06:25] <aro> i see
[02:06:28] <Cork> only css can see them
[02:06:45] <aro> so use css transitions
[02:06:46] <aro> ok
[02:08:16] <aro> so one question - if i have  transition: border-color 1s ease;   - and then i change the border property using border-right: 15px solid #333;
[02:08:19] <aro> will that animate?
[02:08:22] <aro> or does it have to be explicit
[02:08:45] <Cork> if you change it with a css class, sure
[02:08:58] <Cork> if you change it in style on the element, no
[02:09:44] <aro> ok
[02:10:08] <Cork> transition triggers when a difference selector matches the element
[02:10:17] <Cork> not by specific values changing
[02:10:48] <Cork> hmm, or am i remembering wrong there...
[02:10:49] <Cork> give me a min
[02:11:05] <Cork> ah, sorry
[02:11:15] <Cork> you want to change values on a before/after
[02:11:24] <Cork> and you can't change any value on those from js
[02:12:41] <aro> ok
[02:12:45] <aro> but css transitions will work
[02:12:46] <aro> ?
[02:12:50] <Cork> yes
[02:13:18] <aro> cool
[02:14:19] <Cork> aro: and i was wrong about transition, as long as js can modify the transition value it will animate https://jsfiddle.net/evssfLhy/
[02:14:27] <Cork> but js can't target before/after elements so...
[02:15:40] <aro> oh ok
[02:15:57] <aro> how close is 250ms in the animate function in js to the 250ms in a css transition?
[02:16:22] <Cork> it will most likely be a little shorter
[02:16:43] <Cork> as transition prerenderes so it gets an as close to perfect animation as possible
[02:16:55] <Cork> while .animate users a timer solution so it can be delayed
[02:17:00] <aro> hmm ok
[02:17:09] <aro> i just have these two running in parallel
[02:17:13] <aro> so i want them to be timed properly
[02:17:27] <Cork> i would most likely try to avoid using .animate
[02:17:44] <Cork> transition can animate anything except dynamic height
[02:17:52] <Cork> and does a much better job at it
[02:18:21] <aro> ok
[02:18:32] <aro> what about box shadows? :)
[02:18:33] <Cork> and if i remember correctly all css transition/animations happen on the same thread so it is always in sync
[02:18:39] <aro> can those be animated with css transitions?
[02:18:55] <Cork> while js happen in js thread and css happen on a separate thread so it can go different speed
[02:31:10] <Cork> aro: sorry missed the question, yes any css value; except auto and display can be animated
[02:58:30] <MACscr> Ok, so I have 3 columns setup with bootstrap and im wondering if i can turn the 3rd column into a drawer by click but without it affecting the other columns. Obviously that goes really against the point of the columns, but im trying to figure a good way to make the editor bigger when needed. Would probably have it go like 70% of the width of the page or something like that. This is what I have right now http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/57/
[02:58:59] <MACscr> im wondering if maybe i should just abandon the columns and use positioning instead
[02:59:20] <MACscr> i really dont need this app to be responsive
[02:59:53] <MACscr> right now i just want to think of the best way to make the editor more user friendly when there is a lot of code
[03:00:02] <Chulbul>  Best practice: typeof case !== 'undefined' or typeof case !== undefined ??
[03:00:13] <Chulbul> quotes or without quotes?
[03:00:20] <MACscr> quotes
[03:00:36] <MACscr> afaik
[03:00:45] <sloft> there is no without quotes
[03:25:39] <Cork> Chulbul: typeof generates a string
[03:25:47] <Cork> so the second version shouldn't match with !==
[03:25:54] <Cork> (it would with != though)
[03:27:06] <Cork> ah, no cause that would match the constructor of undefined :)
[03:27:11] <Cork> so ya, second can't ever work
[04:21:31] <Jesper__> Hey! I'm having some trouble with a jQuery ajax() call - First of all, heres a jsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/ba0fp7jr/
[04:21:48] <Jesper__> I'm using PHP - If the .txt file I'm saving to contains JSON users, everything works fine
[04:22:06] <Jesper__> However, if the file is empty, or the array of users is empty, I keep reaching the fail statement of my ajax function call
[04:22:32] <Jesper__> Ideally, I want to check if the file is empty, or the array is empty, and if so, I want to create an array of json objects, and save it as text
[04:40:01] <Jesper__> Nvm, it works now :)
[05:01:50] <MACscr> if im making an content editor and i want to make sure the user has saved before they exit the page, how do you think i should keep track of if any changes have been made since it was last saved?
[05:36:47] <EugenA> I have some text inputs with class my-class, each of them has .focusout, where I do ajax and on .done I want to get the value of the input
[05:37:15] <EugenA> in .done I try: $(this).val(); but it doesn't work
[05:37:50] <EugenA> $('.my-class').focusout(function() {...}
[05:37:59] <EugenA> am I missing here something?
[05:41:11] <EugenA> I just cannot access the element from .done(), but can access it outside of ajax
[05:41:13] <EugenA> why?
[05:50:38] <Cork> EugenA: you're calling $(this) in the done callback?
[05:50:49] <EugenA> yes
[05:51:36] <EugenA> workaround is "var $t = $(this);" before ajax.. but why $(this) doesn't work?
[05:51:51] <Cork> EugenA: do $.ajax({ context: this }) and it will work
[05:52:03] <Cork> EugenA: every function() {} you have get there own this variable
[05:52:20] <Cork> so the variable you're using isn't the same as the one from the .focusout(function() {}
[05:53:17] <Cork> the context option in $.ajax sets the this variable in the ajax callbacks to the value you give it
[05:56:16] <Cork> EugenA: also, this is how js works, it isn't jquery doing anything weird
[05:56:24] <Cork> just so that's clear :)
[05:56:39] <EugenA> ok
[06:06:06] <terens> I had to manually set data to 200 elements because I have no template engine
[06:06:08] <terens> shit
[06:06:58] <Cork> terens: templating is fairly easy even with vanila js
[06:10:20] <terens> how ?
[06:35:47] <nov0> good morning everyone, could someone advise me which version of jQuery to user alongside using jQueryMobile 1.4.5 please?
[06:36:18] <Woet> nov0: why not read the first result on google for "jquerymobile 1.4.5"? https://blog.jquerymobile.com/2014/10/31/jquery-mobile-1-4-5-released/
[06:37:58] <nov0> ah thank Woet (my bad!) however reading now, i am using 3.x jQuery and told it was not compatible with jQm 1.4.5 ? (that information states otherwise..)
[06:38:29] <Woet> nov0: well, it is over 2 years old after all
[06:41:26] <nov0> i see, so (on a personal opinion) i should use a jQuery 1.x version to coencide with the jQmobile version?
[06:41:54] <Woet> im not sure, i havent used jquery mobile im afraid
[06:43:09] <nov0> ah ok not a problem, i will go with that jQmobile site example usecase. many thanks for replying to my question :)
[07:43:33] <`ULT> Hello, this is what I want to achieve:  When hovering over a option, displaying a popover/ popup on fixed position option and a black overlay.
[07:43:37] <`ULT> Look also: http://prntscr.com/ecsxoy
[07:43:50] <`ULT> Should I make this by myself or is there a good plugin for doing this?
[07:46:03] <emilsedgh> Everyone, I'm using jquery ui. There are tens of date pickers in my page. my issue is that on Safari Mobile, everything becomes "extremely" slow. The browser couldnt scroll anymore. I tracked it down to a signle datepicker.option() call
[07:46:10] <emilsedgh> even if its a read only call
[07:46:58] <emilsedgh> like, if i do a $(my_element).option(), the whole webpage becomes unusable.
[07:47:12] <emilsedgh> Does anyone have any idea what could be the resaon?
[07:56:46] <emilsedgh> (please note that the jqui element in question is embedded within an iframe)
[07:58:47] <Woet> emilsedgh: why dont you use the html5 datepicker?
[07:59:13] <Woet> will look way nicer too
[07:59:29] <Woet> https://nooshu.github.io/images/2012/03/date-type-input-mobile.gif
[07:59:41] <emilsedgh> Woet: the issue is that im embedding a frame in my webapp which i dont control
[07:59:59] <Woet> emilsedgh: how do you mean? if you can write JS you can change the type of the field
[08:00:23] <emilsedgh> im embedding an iframe from another site. the ui is in that iframe.
[08:01:04] <Woet> okay.. but arent you the one writing JS code that can affect that frame?
[08:01:20] <emilsedgh> yes I can
[08:01:25] <Woet> so change the type of the fields.
[08:01:46] <emilsedgh> but there's a ton of scripts and logic inside the iframe tht depends on jqui
[08:01:56] <emilsedgh> not easy to complete replace
[08:02:06] <Woet> poorly written then
[08:02:32] <emilsedgh> yeah :(
[09:48:53] <PhpNoob> hi
[09:48:58] <PhpNoob> https://github.com/xoxco/jQuery-Tags-Input im using this
[09:49:09] <PhpNoob> i have problem with tags id
[09:49:20] <PhpNoob> its change when i remove tags
[09:49:34] <PhpNoob> if i removed tags , tags id is undefined id
[09:50:57] <PhpNoob> http://kopy.io/9ejA9 code is here
[09:51:40] <Cork> PhpNoob: could you create a working jsfiddle example?
[09:51:56] <Cork> it is very hard to debug code you don't know if all you have is a dead code dump
[09:52:22] <PhpNoob> http://xoxco.com/projects/code/tagsinput/example.html this is example page
[09:52:24] <PhpNoob> i just add id
[09:53:01] <Cork> for future references a jsfiddle is better as one can make changes to see if it works, but ok
[09:54:37] <Cork> is it elem_tags you're having problem with?
[09:54:44] <Cork> there are no id in the page
[09:54:58] <PhpNoob> yes i added it id
[09:55:15] <PhpNoob> $('<span id="tago" value="'+options.id+'">').addClass('tag').append(
[09:55:21] <PhpNoob> i added this its get id
[09:55:31] <Cork> uh, it isn't in the page
[09:55:35] <PhpNoob> but when i remove any tags the otherrs tags id is undefined
[09:56:05] <Cork> could you please make a jsfiddle.net with the problem you're actually trying to work with?
[09:56:24] <PhpNoob> but my item have name and id
[09:56:40] <PhpNoob> can i show it local area?
[10:04:19] <PhpNoob> any idea?
[10:05:17] <Cork> i'm not psychic, so you will have to wait for someone that is or provide what i asked for
[10:05:40] <PhpNoob> psychic?
[10:06:01] <Cork> i can't read the code you're looking at if you don't provide it...
[10:06:36] <Cork> and no a generic example of the plugin without your code isn't a substitute
[10:06:54] <PhpNoob> my code is : http://kopy.io/GiPPq
[10:07:35] <Cork> PhpNoob: https://jsfiddle.net/  make an example with the html, js and css relevant to have a WORKING example of where the problem comes from
[10:08:01] <Cork> a fraction of a function with variables coming from somewhere not in the snipet won't help
[10:08:23] <Cork> one need to be able to see the flow of the execution
[10:08:37] <Cork> i don't know the project, so i can't know what your doing
[10:10:21] <PhpNoob> id is dynamic
[10:10:30] <PhpNoob> how can i put it to jsfield
[10:10:49] <Cork> generate an example of what you are working with from a js stand point
[10:11:55] <PhpNoob> if you connect my pc i can show it
[10:16:26] <PhpNoob> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/7aDak/8202/
[11:40:01] <Es0teric> anyone here use atwho.js ?
[11:40:10] <Es0teric> because i was wondering if the sorting can be changed
[11:40:13] <Es0teric> on render
[11:47:46] <PhpNoob> http://kopy.io/G7Kn1 i got this error : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of null
[11:47:50] <PhpNoob> how can i fix it?
[11:53:20] <taplar> PhpNoob: by that snipplet, selection is a string.  forEach is an array method
[11:53:32] <PhpNoob> so?
[11:53:45] <taplar> so you are trying to do selection.forEach
[11:54:00] <taplar> which selection is either null or a string, neither work with forEach
[11:54:13] <PhpNoob> what i need to type?
[11:54:39] <taplar> do you understand why that is an issue?
[11:54:49] <PhpNoob> its not array
[11:54:55] <PhpNoob> you told me
[11:55:01] <PhpNoob> so what i need to write there?
[11:55:12] <taplar> i don't know.  what are you trying to do?
[11:55:23] <PhpNoob> its select multiple items
[11:55:23] <Uhku> makeeverythingwork(); should do it
[11:55:27] <taplar> lol
[11:56:00] <taplar> you are selecting by an id.  you cannot be selecting multiple items
[11:57:18] <Uhku> taplar: that's not the problem, that selection is coming from val()
[11:58:00] <taplar> even if that was not the case, id selection can't return multiple things
[11:58:11] <taplar> and i already mentioned the string issue
[11:58:36] <taplar> so, still stuck in the what are you trying to do phase, :)
[11:59:23] <Uhku> PhpNoob: is that select of your actually multiple select?
[11:59:57] <Uhku> val() seems to return array always if it's a multiple select
[12:00:02] <PhpNoob> var selection = $('#subcat').val() || [] this line is solved
[12:00:18] <taplar> no dude
[12:00:24] <taplar> why are you doing that?
[12:00:38] <PhpNoob> i replaced this line var selection = $('#subcat').val() || [] to var selection= $('#subcat').val();
[12:00:55] <PhpNoob> is that wrong?
[12:01:01] <PhpNoob> but error is gone
[12:01:06] <Uhku> i dont see anything wrong with that
[12:01:15] <taplar> cause it doesn't make sense
[12:01:21] <taplar> string || [] doesn't make sense
[12:01:24] <Uhku> val() returns null if there's nothing selected
[12:01:27] <taplar> 'error goes away is not fixing the problem'
[12:01:41] <Uhku> taplar: but val() returns an array on multiple selects
[12:01:51] <Uhku> taplar: even if there's only one selected
[12:01:54] <taplar> id selection will never return an array
[12:02:02] <taplar> huh?
[12:02:25] <Es0teric> so nobody here uses atwhojs?
[12:02:26] <Uhku> taplar: what part are you not getting? the selection var was always return value from val(), not the jquery selector
[12:03:11] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/yz47kcym/
[12:03:19] <taplar> how is that an array
[12:03:40] <Uhku> taplar: <select multiple="true"> ...
[12:03:52] <taplar> aaaaah
[12:03:55] <PhpNoob> <option value="10">CAT3</option> my selection is like that
[12:04:16] <Uhku> taplar: so many "select" in that horrible paste! :D
[12:04:54] <PhpNoob> yes its multiple
[12:05:03] <PhpNoob> dropdown select
[12:05:28] <PhpNoob> can i ask second question :)
[12:05:34] <Uhku> you just did
[12:05:42] <Uhku> but feel free to ask a third one
[12:05:44] <taplar> ok, so that makes sense.
[12:06:06] <PhpNoob> https://github.com/xoxco/jQuery-Tags-Input im using this methos
[12:06:09] <PhpNoob> methods
[12:06:20] <PhpNoob> http://xoxco.com/projects/code/tagsinput/example.html here is an example
[12:06:40] <PhpNoob> when i select products from dropdown
[12:06:55] <PhpNoob> product name is added to tags field
[12:06:58] <PhpNoob> its ok
[12:07:03] <PhpNoob> and i get id with that
[12:07:30] <PhpNoob> like that <span id="tago" value="65" class="tag">
[12:07:35] <PhpNoob> value is id
[12:07:50] <PhpNoob> for example there is 5 tags
[12:08:08] <PhpNoob> if i remove one of them. all value is converting undefined
[12:08:17] <Uhku> how about making a fiddle instead of spending tons of time to explain it and not getting an answer
[12:08:19] <PhpNoob> like that value="undefined"
[12:08:42] <PhpNoob> thats my problem
[12:08:54] <Uhku> how are you getting that value? i'm getting .attr('value') is the only way with that broken html
[12:09:04] <Uhku> s/getting/guessing/
[12:09:06] <PhpNoob> get value to tags?
[12:09:23] <SlimmyJimmy> Should I put a click handler on the jQuery.mobile button(that is the wrapping div) or on the inner anchor itself?
[12:09:24] <PhpNoob> $('<span id="tago" value="'+options.id+'">').addClass('tag').append( with this
[12:09:43] <Uhku> that's setting, not getting
[12:10:37] <PhpNoob> Uhku http://kopy.io/rayK2
[12:10:47] <Uhku> SlimmyJimmy: probably the wrapping if its bigger
[12:12:10] <Uhku> PhpNoob: where's the remove part?
[12:12:40] <Uhku> oh there
[12:12:46] <Uhku> PhpNoob: what's your value?
[12:12:46] <PhpNoob> http://kopy.io/ZZQbI this is full js code
[12:12:51] <PhpNoob> value is my id
[12:14:31] <Uhku> well if you're not gonna show your code, it's pretty much impossible to help
[12:14:41] <PhpNoob> i showed you?
[12:14:44] <PhpNoob> there link
[12:15:00] <PhpNoob> http://kopy.io/rayK2 and http://kopy.io/ZZQbI
[12:17:15] <Uhku> pasting that plugins code isn't gonna help
[12:17:21] <Uhku> pasting YOUR code might
[12:17:51] <PhpNoob> connect to my pc with tw
[12:17:55] <PhpNoob> i can show you
[12:18:15] <Uhku> i dont know what tw is and i'm not gonna do that
[12:18:22] <PhpNoob> tw is teamviewer
[12:18:57] <PhpNoob> ?
[12:20:39] <PhpNoob> you said no?
[12:21:26] <taplar> we prefer functioning fiddles of the issues.  not remoting into peoples boxes
[12:21:57] <PhpNoob> yes but its special :( dynamic
[12:22:09] <PhpNoob> i cannot show that problem in jsfield
[12:22:44] <taplar> everything 'dynamic' is generated on page load.  you can always look at the source of the generate page to get what you need for the fiddle
[12:23:01] <PhpNoob> its with php i mean
[12:23:25] <taplar> which generates markup that the frontend renders and your javascript runs on
[12:23:32] <taplar> which can be put in a fiddle
[12:24:01] <PhpNoob> :(
[12:25:19] <taplar> most of us are are work ourselves man.  we don't have time to remote into a persons box.  a fiddle is by far one of the easiest ways to help.  and also the act of you recreating the issue in a fiddle can potentially help you solve the problem without our intervention
[12:25:31] <PhpNoob> i think its only 5min
[12:25:52] <taplar> so it'll only take you 5 mins to make the fiddle
[13:06:40] <Es0teric> so nobody here uses atwhojs?
[13:42:19] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[13:42:34] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric did you have a question?
[13:42:56] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah, i am trying to figure out how to unset the default sorting method
[13:43:02] <robertmaxrees> link to docs?
[13:43:03] <Es0teric> since it is messing with the sort i already had in SQL
[13:43:08] <robertmaxrees> and/or a fiddle?
[13:43:23] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://github.com/ichord/At.js/wiki
[13:43:27] <Es0teric> i think its sorter
[13:43:34] <Es0teric> i dont have a fiddle
[13:43:49] <Es0teric> this is something that is happening in an area i have no control over so the fiddle would be useless
[13:43:57] <Es0teric> since i dont understand how do unset it or overwrite it
[13:43:58] <robertmaxrees> nah it wouldn't be.
[13:44:34] <Es0teric> still
[13:44:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:44:45] <robertmaxrees> i'll look at the docs.
[13:44:51] <robertmaxrees> so what have you tried?
[13:45:14] <Es0teric> well in the invoking of it, i tried setting the callback sorter to return item;
[13:45:29] <Es0teric> but it doesnt overwrite whats currently there because the sorter is still sorting
[13:45:53] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/ichord/At.js/blob/330a42714c4bb5046723b21290a782075792dafe/src/default.coffee#L94-L102
[13:46:14] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:46:32] <robertmaxrees> so how are you trying to set the sorter?
[13:50:14] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric
[13:50:30] <Es0teric> well i have a callback object
[13:50:36] <Es0teric> and in that object, i am setting the sorter there
[13:50:44] <robertmaxrees> can you at least show me that part?
[13:50:50] <robertmaxrees> so i can validate that you're doing it correctly?
[13:52:21] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/KbijET6M
[13:52:35] <Es0teric> line 94
[13:52:48] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[13:52:50] <robertmaxrees> wrong way to do that.
[13:53:03] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/ichord/At.js/blob/master/examples/hashtags.html#L14-L33
[13:53:10] <robertmaxrees> this is how they want you to set custom callback.
[13:53:39] <Es0teric> thats not the point
[13:53:41] <Es0teric> this shit is all in buddypress
[13:53:42] <robertmaxrees> ....
[13:53:50] <Es0teric> thats just a small part
[13:53:52] <robertmaxrees> "hey so here's how the plugin says to do it"
[13:54:03] <Es0teric> i am not setting a custom callback
[13:54:07] <Es0teric> sorter already exists
[13:54:07] <robertmaxrees> "WELL THAT'S NOT THE POINT"
[13:54:09] <robertmaxrees> like, what?
[13:54:27] <robertmaxrees> you ARE setting a custom callback.
[13:54:36] <robertmaxrees> you're definitng your own callback for sorter.
[13:54:44] <robertmaxrees> you pass it as apart of that init.
[13:54:52] <jak2000> robertmaxrees hi
[13:55:05] * jak2000 send to robert a six pack of Corona beer
[13:55:09] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:55:39] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok then so if i want to overwrite the sorter, isnt that how i overwrite it?
[13:55:53] <robertmaxrees> you pass it as apart of the optionjs.
[13:55:55] <robertmaxrees> *options
[13:56:03] <robertmaxrees> not the way you're doing there.
[13:56:40] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees so what you're saying is options as in the 5th param in line 100
[13:56:43] <taplar> lol
[13:56:56] * jak2000 send to taplar a six pack of BudLight beer
[13:56:59] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:57:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying you pass it as apart of the callbacks option.
[13:57:19] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/ichord/At.js/blob/master/examples/hashtags.html#L21-L30
[13:57:20] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[13:57:22] <Darmani> Hey guys! jQuery Timepicker only seems to work for choosing the time once. After that the js widget doesn't show up anymore.
[13:57:24] <robertmaxrees> just use sorter there instead
[13:57:29] <Darmani> Anyone know why that is?
[13:57:33] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees line 5
[13:57:41] <taplar> timepicker?
[13:57:48] <Darmani> taplar: ya
[13:57:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:57:54] <taplar> got a link?
[13:57:55] <robertmaxrees> line 5 is the document title here duder.
[13:58:00] <Es0teric> the sorter is inside of the callbacks option
[13:58:11] <Darmani> uhhh no lol
[13:58:22] <robertmaxrees> right.  you pass it as a part of the callbacks
[13:58:25] <Es0teric> the one i am trying to overwrite
[13:58:30] <Es0teric> ok so we are talking about the same thing
[13:58:34] <Es0teric> you're telling me something that already exists
[13:58:36] <Es0teric> which is confusing me
[13:59:05] <Darmani> taplar: I mean the setup is pretty straightforward. I have a text field and timepicker attached to it.
[13:59:06] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/f4f9aa0d67f98df893766a65b419cca1
[13:59:07] <Es0teric> the sorter option that i am trying to overwrite exists within the callbacks option that is in the mentionsDefaults var
[13:59:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[13:59:40] <Es0teric> =_=
[13:59:47] <robertmaxrees> you're not passing it as apart of the init.
[13:59:55] <taplar> Darmani: yeah but I'm not familiar with every plugin every joe shmoe makes entitled jQuery "thing"
[14:00:06] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees so then what is the init in that context? its not mentionsDefaults
[14:00:07] <Es0teric> right?
[14:00:10] <Darmani> taplar: hahaha
[14:00:19] <Es0teric> would it be the 2nd param in line 100?
[14:00:19] <robertmaxrees> $('#editable').atwho({})
[14:00:35] <Darmani> It's popular so I thought you would know lol
[14:02:51] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees dude, your example is confusing me.. i do not have the same setup
[14:02:51] <Es0teric> did you even take a look at the pastebin?
[14:02:51] <taplar> this thing? http://timepicker.co/
[14:02:51] <taplar> and can you make a fiddle showing the issue?
[14:02:51] <Darmani> taplar: https://github.com/jonthornton/jquery-timepicker
[14:02:51] <Darmani> this one.
[14:02:51] <Darmani> and yeah sure hold on.
[14:04:06] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric myt entire point is your setup makes no sense.
[14:04:18] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees how does it not make sense?
[14:04:26] <robertmaxrees> why not just pass in options like normal?
[14:04:35] <Es0teric> because buddypress didnt make it that way
[14:04:36] <Es0teric> obv
[14:04:42] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[14:04:46] <robertmaxrees> enjoy duder
[14:04:52] <Es0teric> =_=
[14:05:07] <Darmani> taplar: I found this one. I have the exact same code but after I pick a time the dropdown doesn't show anymore.
[14:05:07] <Darmani> http://jsfiddle.net/jonthornton/28uvg/
[14:05:11] <Es0teric> if it was a regular setup i would be able to somewhat figure it out but what you have shown me is completely irrelevant
[14:05:15] <Es0teric> because its not the same thing
[14:05:27] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:05:31] <robertmaxrees> glhf
[14:05:46] <taplar> so you have the exact thing, the fiddle works, but yours does not?
[14:06:34] <Darmani> yeah
[14:06:48] <taplar> do you have any other events tied to the element like an on change or anything?
[14:07:12] <taplar> cause somethings different
[14:07:47] <Darmani> Well my guess is because the element is tied to an ajax call and gets loaded after the initial script loads timepicker.
[14:07:57] <Darmani> So maybe within the ajax call I have to load timepicker(); again?
[14:08:09] <taplar> any time you replace that element you have to reinitialize it
[14:08:10] <Darmani> oh yeah that's what it was.
[14:08:13] <Darmani> I just fixed it.
[14:08:30] <Darmani> taplar: cool ^.^
[14:37:36] <SlimmyJimmy> My jquery.mobile .button()'s aren't working. The .click() event handlers don't fire. I'm setting the .click() event handlers on the jQuery buttons after creating them. So it's like $('#XXXX').button().click(); The wrapped element is an <a></a>. Can someone advise why this isn't working?
[14:38:13] <juinn> hey guy im tyring to get tr of my table by its tr index...what am i doing wrong please?      $($table, 'tr').eq(tr_index).each(function(i){
[14:38:45] <taplar> swap your variables
[14:38:51] <taplar> or do $table.find('tr')
[14:39:29] <taplar> $(selector, parentElement)
[14:40:18] <WhirledPress> SlimmyJimmy, did you get an answer to your question?
[14:40:33] <SlimmyJimmy> I don't think so
[14:40:46] <WhirledPress> try not wrapping your buttons in an anchor element
[14:40:58] <WhirledPress> or try catching the click event on the anchor element, not the button
[14:41:23] <SlimmyJimmy> I can try that I guess.
[14:41:41] <juinn> taplar: thank you
[14:47:21] <SlimmyJimmy> It's still not working
[14:47:45] <WhirledPress> can you create an example on jsfiddle.
[14:49:44] <WhirledPress> I'm checking to see if the .button() method is chainable.
[14:50:20] <SlimmyJimmy> I did away with the chaining like you asked. I set the .click event handler on the anchers first. And then called .button() on the anchors
[14:52:44] <WhirledPress> reading the documentation for jqmobile...
[14:54:11] <SlimmyJimmy> It's more than likely something I've screwed up over here. I'm adding the anchors dynamically to a td in a table using a for loop.
[14:54:34] <WhirledPress> post your code to a fiddle
[14:55:21] <SlimmyJimmy> I can try but the actual project is pretty big.
[14:55:47] <WhirledPress> just post part of it. the part that you are having problems with
[15:11:38] <BTM> What is the best way to append an element to HTML (with an incrementing class)?
[15:12:22] <taplar> incrementing class?
[15:13:15] <taplar> $(parentSelector).append(newThing);  or $newThing.appendTo(parentSelector);   either work
[15:13:30] <BTM> Yes, I need to count the amount on dynamically created objects I have (x), then generate (x-amount) of 'lis' that are classed as obj-1, obj2, etc
[15:14:05] <taplar> but why increment a class?
[15:14:20] <taplar> classes are meant to group like things together
[15:14:56] <BTM> Oh true, what about incrementing in general, like for an href?
[15:15:00] <taplar> an id or a data element for the number would probably be more appropriate
[15:15:23] <taplar> <tag class="commonClass" data-num="5">
[15:16:03] <BTM> I can't hard code the number though
[15:16:18] <BTM>     $('.modular-timeline').append('<li><a href="#tab-(x)">Tab 1</a></li>');
[15:16:21] <taplar> i'm not saying to.  i'm showing an example of the resulting markup
[15:18:19] <BTM> Yeah I get the idea behind the id and data, but since this is creating a dynamic tabber type module, I need a way to increment the href
[15:19:01] <taplar> sure, but that's not referencing a class
[15:19:22] <taplar> an href that targets a # is going after an id
[15:20:46] <BTM> I know, forget the class part.   If I'm using append, how can I add a 1,2,3 etc on my href's #tab-  value?
[15:21:42] <taplar> you can concat it in as normal with strings
[15:21:45] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/jbu05b7g/ BTM
[15:22:12] <taplar> however i would build them all with map or something and append once
[15:22:41] <WhirledPress> sorry, I forgot to add tab- in the href..but you get the idea
[15:22:52] <WhirledPress> what he said...
[15:24:12] <BTM> I see, I was putting it in and it kept canceling out since I was closing with "" and appending with ''
[15:25:19] <BTM> That fixed my issue, thanks so much!
[15:53:45] <quechon> hello guys when using ajax GET what does the data option do
[15:54:14] <robertmaxrees> "A plain object or string that is sent to the server with the request."
[15:54:15] <quechon> i know in post request data is the data you want to send to server
[15:54:33] <robertmaxrees> basically, it appends it to the url as querystring params.
[15:54:36] <robertmaxrees> if it's an object.
[15:54:46] <quechon> oooh ok
[15:54:57] <robertmaxrees> like the normal ajax version.
[15:56:09] <quechon> ok i see thanks
[16:57:50] <juinn> guys im trying to compare 2 strings but even though they are different, my function doesn't return true
[16:57:52] <juinn> https://jsfiddle.net/nyyjLw71/
[16:58:46] <robertmaxrees> what are the two strings?
[16:59:08] <robertmaxrees> John Doe vs John Doe?
[16:59:34] <juinn> yes then 0700
[16:59:43] <robertmaxrees> ah. because you're trying to return out of an .each()
[16:59:48] <robertmaxrees> can't do that.
[16:59:53] <juinn> 07000fdsfsdf    07000
[17:00:04] <juinn> oh
[17:00:11] <juinn> thats poor
[17:00:15] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:00:21] <robertmaxrees> native .forEach is the same way.
[17:00:23] <juinn> how would i work around that?
[17:00:28] <robertmaxrees> it's not meant for this kind of job.
[17:01:05] <robertmaxrees> you're comparing the value of an input against its data attribute?
[17:01:10] <juinn> yes
[17:01:19] <juinn> want to see if any editting has been done
[17:02:06] <robertmaxrees> and you want to know if any td within a tr is different?
[17:03:11] <taplar> find the tds, filter on those that have a different value, check the length
[17:03:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:03:52] <juinn> ok got you thank you :)
[17:03:55] <juinn> both
[17:04:51] <robertmaxrees> also, use !==

[17:11:51] <robertmaxrees> working too hard.
[17:11:59] <juinn> ^my brain
[17:11:59] <robertmaxrees> use .filter()
[17:12:02] <robertmaxrees> are you familar with it?
[17:12:14] <juinn> no im so fresh to this
[17:12:26] <robertmaxrees> so when taplar said to use filter, what went through your head?
[17:12:47] <taplar> it's friday, this guy tells me to use filter, fk that.  i'm gonna loop
[17:12:52] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:12:53] <robertmaxrees> srs.
[17:12:54] <robertmaxrees> sec.

[17:16:53] <robertmaxrees> workin'
[17:16:57] <robertmaxrees> *workin' too hard.
[17:18:22] <juinn> robertmaxrees: thank you very much
[17:18:58] <juinn> although can't help you happened to feel sorry for my and my miserbale attempt :)
[17:19:08] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:19:11] <robertmaxrees> just stuff you gotta learn.
[17:19:17] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a great primer.
[17:20:50] <guzzlefry> Okay, what's the obvious thing that I'm missing here? I need to remove the disabled property from the .channel elements. https://jsfiddle.net/hpzpz1hm/4/
[17:21:38] <juinn> yeah i think i'm gonna have to read the manuel
[17:21:47] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry missing juqery there.
[17:22:10] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: it's included.
[17:22:30] <robertmaxrees> also: https://api.jquery.com/removeProp/ -> "Do not use this method to remove native properties such as checked, disabled, or selected. "
[17:22:56] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: I've tried $.prop('disabled', false) as well.
[17:23:05] <robertmaxrees> $channelButtons.prop('disabled', false);
[17:23:37] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/hpzpz1hm/6/ nope...
[17:24:13] <juinn> thank you for your help...night
[17:24:58] <robertmaxrees> wait can a tags even be disabled like that?
[17:26:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, okay, that psuedoclass really only properly works on input elements.
[17:26:42] <robertmaxrees> can hack around it but I'd go with classes here instead.
[17:27:01] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: Works if I run .removeAttr(), but it seems improper.
[17:27:06] <robertmaxrees> right.

[17:27:38] <robertmaxrees> should just use classes here instead

[18:06:29] <WhirledPress> how do you animate scrollTop on a div accurately? I found tons of examples of how to animate a page, but a div is different...

[18:25:59] <taplar> but it makes more sense now, ^_^

[18:29:44] <tripflex> :-(
[18:29:47] <quechon> what is 'HEAD' in ajax
[18:30:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:30:08] <robertmaxrees> context?
[18:30:44] <quechon> type: 'HEAD'
[18:30:53] <quechon> what does that do
[18:31:34] <quechon> couldnt find good answer on jquery documentation
[18:31:52] <robertmaxrees> quechon http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ -> "An alias for method. You should use type if you're using versions of jQuery prior to 1.9.0."
[18:31:58] <robertmaxrees> just setting the type of call to "HEAD"
[18:32:05] <robertmaxrees> like POST or GET
[18:32:21] <robertmaxrees> tripflex so where spoecifically is the issue?
[18:32:46] <tripflex> is issue is trying to prevent someone from adding a user addition that's not a valid email
[18:33:27] <robertmaxrees> so where in code doe sthat get controlled?
[18:33:30] <robertmaxrees> big fiddle, sorry.
[18:34:21] <taplar> quechon: are you asking what a HEAD request is?
[18:34:48] <tripflex> yeah i duped some of the code, the prototype is just for the output of the first item that is clickable
[18:35:29] <tripflex> haha well that's the fun part about all of this, i don't know hah
[18:35:30] <quechon> i found a answer for it
[18:35:46] <robertmaxrees> tripflex is all of this code necessary to replicate the issue?
[18:35:49] <quechon> i found a script online using head so wanted to know
[18:35:55] <arosen> Anyone know how i can get these div to slide in side by side when the user clicks? Right now it's doing a little jump: https://jsfiddle.net/aomh3L6r/
[18:37:21] <arosen> I'm trying to figure out how to implement a side over animation when a user clicks on something and the div is shown.
[18:37:36] <taplar> arosen: you should put each piece in each of the relevant sections, not all in the html area man
[18:38:09] <taplar> also there are quite a few slider plugins out in the wild
[18:38:09] <arosen> taplar:  k, i'll fix that one sec. sorry.
[18:40:51] <robertmaxrees> tripflex why aren't you using the semantic form validation stuff for that?
[18:40:59] <tripflex> haha i tried to
[18:41:07] <tripflex> none of it would work for me
[18:41:14] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:41:16] <robertmaxrees> try to fix that then.
[18:41:19] <robertmaxrees> instead of rolling your own.
[18:41:43] <tripflex> oh i did, i tried digging into it as much as i could just problem after problem
[18:41:56] <robertmaxrees> and that's different from yoru current setup how?
[18:41:57] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:42:08] <robertmaxrees> use their pre-baked solution. trust me.
[18:42:30] <robertmaxrees> also: https://gitter.im/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI
[18:42:36] <robertmaxrees> they have a chat roomt hat might be more helpful.
[18:42:38] <taplar> what are you calling a valid email address?  because that is super vague, and hard to validate
[18:42:43] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[18:42:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:43:08] <tripflex> i'm not set on any type of extensive validation
[18:43:18] <tripflex> just trying to prevent users from adding "joesmith"
[18:43:28] <tripflex> that's why i used basic validation
[18:43:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, check out their chjat.
[18:43:31] <robertmaxrees> i linked it above.
[18:43:43] <robertmaxrees> they'll be far more helpful than we can be,.
[18:44:01] <taplar> i mean if all your after is string@string, ....
[18:44:05] <taplar> heh
[18:44:24] <taplar> not sure what it buys you
[18:44:41] <robertmaxrees> something tells me semantic has already solved this problem.
[18:45:12] <tripflex> yeah i know, but trying to solve the bigger picture right now
[18:45:19] <robertmaxrees> so go to their chat.
[18:45:28] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you keep ignoring that advice (shrug)
[18:45:29] <tripflex> meh, i used the latest from github but yeah i just did thx
[18:45:40] <tripflex> haha i already have :P
[18:45:42] <tripflex> and posted on their forums
[18:45:58] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you're not likely to get much help here since your issue is with an entire separate library.
[18:46:00] <tripflex> but getting support from them is fairly uncommon
[18:46:13] <tripflex> yeah i know was just hoping some random soul had experience with it :P
[18:46:22] <tripflex> thanks for looking at it though ;-)
[20:22:10] <fattest> Hi. When I click my close button in my list, it is also triggering the click function for the list; how can I fix this? Thanks https://jsfiddle.net/zykck3rn/
[20:27:58] <fattest> Found a solution if anyone is interested https://jsfiddle.net/zykck3rn/1
[20:30:30] <WhirledPress> fattest, you could move the button outside of the anchor element and it might  be easier
[20:30:58] <WhirledPress> fattest, notice when you click a close button, it doesn't close the li...it just hides the anchor
[20:31:43] <fattest> WhirledPress: good suggestion; thank you
