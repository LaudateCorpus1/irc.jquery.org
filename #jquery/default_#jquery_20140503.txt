[02:40:09] <tegowai> hi... anybody there?
[02:41:53] <tegowai> i've got this module of sendmail via php... https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6uCuse7j5XObEpHRFlxY3lnNTQ/edit
[02:42:14] <tegowai> but i can't find where the php code is included within jquery
[02:45:19] <makerimages> hello
[02:45:56] <makerimages> I need help: what encoding does $('id').val() return for a input type="text"  ??
[02:47:10] <makerimages> any?
[02:49:17] <makerimages> guys
[02:49:19] <makerimages> ?
[04:07:33] <jonkristian> jquery-drag-and-drop-tutorial.html they said, we will show you how to do it they said, then i realized they were using jquery ui. aaaaagh, what's the tutorial in that.
[04:28:24] <chachan> guys, this is not working in chromium for any reason http://plnkr.co/edit/pm7Pl0sslrPg8W5p56M9?p=preview
[04:28:32] <chachan> I'm getting nullxnull
[04:28:50] <chachan> any idea what could I be missing?
[04:31:49] <erming> chachan: check if window.innerHeight and document.body.clientHeight exists
[04:32:07] <erming> mthat might be the problem, not $.width() etc
[04:32:26] <erming> it works in Chrome (Windows) btw
[04:33:46] <chachan> erming: before assigment
[04:33:50] <chachan> I do: $('h1').html('Size before: ' + width + 'x' + height);
[04:33:59] <chachan> and it returns valid numbers
[04:34:13] <chachan> I'm getting: Size before: 16x427
[04:34:15] <XTremEive> Hey I created a new Javascript library is any of you interested into giving some feedback?
[04:34:35] <Tekla> well done
[04:34:41] <Tekla> is that enough feedback? :)
[04:35:11] <chachan> haha, that sounds enough
[04:35:33] <XTremEive> I guess that will do for now :)
[04:35:38] <XTremEive> 'coz I'm happay
[04:37:12] <chachan> erming: that works in firefox (kubuntu)
[04:38:02] <chachan> looks like $.height(value) is not working properly in chromium at least with 2.1.0
[04:39:46] <chachan> forget what I said, it's not working in firefox :(
[04:41:13] <erming> try it from JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/kpBn2/1/
[04:41:27] <erming> ah
[04:41:37] <erming> it got the error in firefox now, "Size: 16x0"
[04:41:44] <erming> Atleast, now I can properly debug :>
[04:43:15] <erming> chachan: when the div says nullxnull. If you look at it from the inspector tool, is the height and width set to anything?
[04:43:30] <erming> (Firefox started working.. weird)
[04:43:50] <chachan> erming: haven't checked, let me...
[04:44:52] <chachan> erming: has 0
[04:44:56] <erming> ok
[05:02:13] <chachan> erming: I think I know what's happening...
[05:03:23] <chachan> erming: I'm using angular, and that map comes from a template, which is loaded through an AJAX call, that happens after the script I just sent you ¬¬
[05:03:46] <chachan> that's hopeful :)
[05:04:28] <chachan> I only need to trigger that event when that template is loaded...
[05:14:47] <chachan> how could be the best way to bind an event to an element that is not yet created?. I only know the onload event
[05:19:20] <KMoth> Hey guys, I'm trying to fire off a really simple $.get() from a page to another which returns parseable JSON and a HTTP 200 response but also triggers .fail() as opposed .done()
[05:19:30] <KMoth> Has anyone ever seen this before or can lend some advice?
[05:20:56] <chachan> KMoth: did you set dataType parameter?
[05:21:52] <KMoth> I'm not sure though I'm guessing if I don't know then I have not.
[05:21:56] <KMoth> Is that part of the call or the response?
[05:22:14] <chachan> "The type of data expected from the server. Default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html)."
[05:22:35] <chachan> KMoth: but if you didn't set it, it should guess json
[05:27:11] <KMoth> I think this is most definitely the right thing to do.
[05:32:52] <Nephro> is there a way i can get the calculated width of a displayed div?
[05:37:12] <KMoth> Nephro, dunno about in Jquery but do you mean .offsetwidth?
[05:37:19] <KMoth> Or offsetWidth?
[05:42:37] <KMoth> Okay, I had to refactor a little to be using jQuery.ajax() instead of the .get() I had going before. Am still always receiving a 200 OK response. Am setting the dataType param to "json" but still triggering .fail() for some reason.
[06:27:38] <frank_o> Hi! I have a bunch of resized cats in a div. On hover, the original sized image should appear on top of the smaller one. Problem is that when I subsequently move the mouse, the hover thinks I stopped hovering the smaller image (as I'm now hovering the original sized one). Is there a way to fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/9rwES/5/
[06:38:39] <onequestion> superfish simple question, nav bar, main and 2level display horizontal , great, but the third is vertical. where to make the third level also horizontal. I am just a click click user. Hope the answer is a click also.
[06:38:58] <KMoth> frank_o: There's a few approaches to suggest how to address this but they'll all depend on specifically how you wanna design it.
[06:39:06] <KMoth>  I might suggest though that on hover, you may want to fire a function that handles merely displaying the original (effectively indefinitely) and then a seperate function that purges the original when you mouse-off it.
[06:41:15] <frank_o> KMoth: thats a good idea
[06:41:27] <KMoth> You could also generate a div the same dimensions at the same location as your original as you display it, if you wanted to get particularly fancy and this might hold other benefits too depending on the specific end you have in mind but it really just seems like you need to reorganise a little bit to make things caled at the points you want and have a function to *display_original* then
[06:41:27] <KMoth> *purge_original* might help a lot to clarify it.
[06:42:26] <frank_o> KMoth: im currently generating a div at the same dimensions and same location, no?
[06:43:22] <frank_o> wait maybe i could just do nothing on hoverIntent off, and then launch a new hoverintent on the big image (where i do nothing on hover on, but fade out on hover off)
[06:43:52] <KMoth> Ah yeah you are. Okay.
[06:45:22] <frank_o> KMoth: thanks man
[06:57:04] <frank_o> How come I get nothing on `$(this).find('[data-iscroll]').each(function()` at http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/DWKNw/3/ ?
[06:58:32] <frank_o> alert($(this)); should return #wrapper right?
[07:05:22] <KMoth> I couldn't help with this one, personally. I'm next to inept with JS.
[07:07:07] <frank_o> KMoth: hehe no probs bro
[07:17:03] <frank_o> have improved my question:
[07:17:17] <frank_o> With $(this).find('[data-iscroll]').each() -- how come I'm getting `undefined` despite it actually finding the div? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/DWKNw/5/
[07:23:02] <chachan> where can I ask something related with Google Maps?
[07:23:18] <chachan> I'm having problems with a JS event
[07:25:01] <phelix> Anyone in here famliar with isotope jquery by chance?
[07:56:59] <jonkristian> Is there a oneliner to check if input inside a div has value and then add a class to that div?
[08:34:11] <frank_o> How do I fade out these cats once the user takes his/her mouse off them? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/9rwES/11/
[08:35:55] <onequestion>  superfish simple question, nav bar, main and 2level display horizontal , great, but the third is vertical. where to make the third level also horizontal. I am just a click click user. Hope the answer is a click also.
[09:09:32] <Nomius> Anyone implemented server side processing for tabletools on fnClick?
[09:11:08] <brunoais> Nomius, is that a jQuery extension?
[09:12:05] <Nomius> Yes, for datatables
[09:15:19] <Patabugen> Hey! Is there a difference, aside from preference between doing (function($){ .... })(jQuery) and jQuery(function($){ ... } for wrapping internals up?
[09:19:14] <XTremEive> Patabugen: That's not the same.
[09:19:38] <XTremEive> I mean that's not even the same effect.
[09:20:00] <Patabugen> Could you explain the difference for me?
[09:20:29] <Patabugen> and/or point me in the right directions
[09:22:39] <XTremEive> Patabugen: sure you know "$" is kind of alias for 'jQuery" right?
[09:22:50] <Patabugen> Yeah
[09:23:14] <d0de> what's the easiest way to make a javascript function bound to a range slider asynchronous, so that it doesn't make the movement of the slider handle sluggish?
[09:23:15] <XTremEive> And you know what $(function() {}); is kind of an alias for jQuery.ready(function () {}); right?
[09:23:22] <Patabugen> Yeah
[09:23:41] <Patabugen> I thought jQuery passed itself in as the first parameter to that function?
[09:23:52] <XTremEive> So the second you wrote will execute the code inside function() {...} when the dom is ready right?
[09:24:20] <Patabugen> Ahh, I guess I mean that I'd have a $(function()) inside the former
[09:24:30] <XTremEive> yeah
[09:24:44] <XTremEive> because the first will run right away!
[09:24:50] <Patabugen> Hang on, let me rephrase!
[09:24:57] <XTremEive> regardless of the DOM state.
[09:25:55] <Patabugen> In cases when I wish to run on document ready, is there are reason to wrap the latter of those methods into the former. Do both mean that when jQuery is not bound to $ my code using $ (within the wrappers) will still work?
[09:26:52] <Patabugen> So are these equivelant: (function($){ $.function(){ ... } })(jQuery); and jQuery(function($) { ... });
[09:27:09] <Patabugen> gaah, but when my syntax on the first one is correct ;)
[09:27:23] <XTremEive> haha I think got your question... Kind of.
[09:28:00] <Patabugen> Basically, when I'm writing code to be executed when the DOM is ready, do I need to wrap it in a self-calling function wrapper or can I use my latter method.
[09:29:01] <XTremEive> I guess both work if you want your code to use "$" in a noConflict scenario.
[09:29:35] <Patabugen> Cool, that's what I thought! But thought it was work asking
[09:29:45] <Patabugen> thanks =)
[09:29:54] <XTremEive> The second one is cool, but it assumed you have a 'jQuery" variable. The first one is the realy portable thing as it doesn't assume that you have jQuery object available, and live it to the user's judgement.
[09:30:01] <XTremEive> Which is 0.00000000000000009% of the time.
[09:30:18] <XTremEive> So it depends if your a purist or not.
[09:30:23] <XTremEive> imho
[09:30:37] <Patabugen> The former assumes you have a jQuery because it passes it into the function though, nay?
[09:31:21] <Patabugen> But obviously only works when what you're doing is setting up an on document ready function with jQuery
[09:31:36] <Patabugen> whereas the former is useful outside of the jQuery context too
[09:32:06] <XTremEive> In any case, if it's your website, don't bother too much, but if you intend to distribute your code... Maybe go for the first one.
[09:32:17] <Patabugen> cheeers!
[09:32:22] <Patabugen> gotta run to catch the bus!
[09:51:51] <onequestion> help   superfish , nav bar, main and 2level display horizontal , great, but the third is vertical. where to make the third level also horizontal. I am just a click click user. Hope the answer is a click also.
[10:37:39] <dcope> hey all, is there a good way to truncate text if the parent has a varying width?
[10:37:52] <dcope> i'm trying to do this with dotdotdot but it doesn't seem to be working if the parent has a varying width
[10:42:31] <brunoais> dcope, that's a job for CSS
[10:43:52] <dcope> brunoais: and that would work even if the parent has a varying width?
[10:44:01] <dcope> i've tried it in css too and couldn't get it to work
[10:44:19] <brunoais> dcope, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-overflow
[10:44:28] <brunoais> brb
[10:45:00] <dcope> brunoais: ok cool, ill read this. thx
[10:52:03] <cyclick> Is there anyway to fix this: http://jsfiddle.net/UuYFb/ ?  I'm trying to trigger hover effect on checkbox when mouse moves over <span>  (I currently get a recursion error)
[11:01:51] <decx> use a label, no js required
[11:09:56] <slax0r> Hi, can this be written in a shorter way? $(contentclass).clone().children("div").first().addClass("classname");
[11:16:20] <brunoais> slax0r, no
[11:16:25] <sc_> cyclick: http://jsfiddle.net/UuYFb/
[11:16:36] <sc_> oh whoops
[11:17:01] <brunoais> slax0r, btw, the result of that is nothing happening
[11:17:44] <sc_> cyclick: http://jsfiddle.net/UuYFb/3/
[11:17:46] <sc_> like that?
[11:21:30] <slax0r> brunoais: what do you mean?
[11:21:34] <slax0r> ofc it's happening
[11:21:50] <slax0r> contentclass is only a string, I made that a bit unclear
[11:22:11] <slax0r> and the element is cloned and the first child div of that clone gets a classname added
[11:24:24] <Sal> hi
[11:26:44] <Sal> i have a web page with a top fixed navigation bar and the page contains a list of divs. Some of these divs are group headers. when i scroll the page up, and one of these group headers go under the navigation bar, i need to append that group header to the navigation bar so that the header text is always on screen
[11:26:56] <Sal> anyone has an idea on how to do that?
[11:28:10] <Sal> i was thinking on finding which div top is less that 48px (navbar height) , take its text and show it on navigation bar
[11:28:26] <Sal> but there could be more than one group header
[11:28:36] <Sal> anyway, was that clear?
[11:28:38] <Sal> hehe
[11:30:06] <brunoais> slax0r, as you don't place it in the DOM, it is useless
[11:33:29] <slax0r> brunoais: who said I don't place it in the dom?
[11:35:11] <brunoais> slax0r, in the code you show, you don'y
[11:35:13] <brunoais> *don't
[11:35:24] <decx> meaning you don't have to clone a string you put in a jq object, the string will remain untouched
[11:37:41] <Sal> i have to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/uFq2k/
[11:38:04] <Sal> but there could be more that 1 Sticky Text line (black) in the text
[11:38:30] <Sal> and every time i scroll up, it should replace the previous ones
[11:38:36] <Sal> and so when i return back down
[11:38:42] <Sal> any idea?
[11:47:57] <slax0r> brunoais: you're right, I don't, but it is not relevant with to my question, and even not printing something to DOM can be usefull, so saying something is useless because it's not printed into DOM is wrong
[12:40:08] <sledgeDJ> how do u do an onclick for a radio button
[12:46:32] <StephenS> sledgeDJ: like everything else?
[12:46:41] <sledgeDJ> onclick doesnt work
[13:25:33] <sledgeDJ> need some help here...  have this code...
[13:25:34] <sledgeDJ> <input type='radio' name='PaymentType' id='PaymentTypePP' value='PayPal' />  Paypal<br><input type='image' src='//images/scpic14.png' onclick='$("#PaymentTypePP").prop("checked",true);' />
[13:25:47] <sledgeDJ> when I click the image it changes the radio button to selected
[13:25:58] <sledgeDJ> then it auto-loads a page
[13:26:25] <sledgeDJ> but when you just select the button by clicking it and not the image, nothing happens other then it gets selected.
[13:26:44] <sledgeDJ> it seems that onclick='$("#PaymentTypePP").prop("checked",true); just sets it to chdecked
[13:26:54] <sledgeDJ> so shouldnt checking it do the same thing?
[13:27:25] <jphase> sledgeDJ: that will only set it to checked, correct. also, get out of the habit of using onclick attribute
[13:27:32] <jphase> attributes*
[13:27:39] <jphase> use jQuery to bind the event
[13:27:58] <sledgeDJ> this is someones old BS code that i am trying to fix
[13:28:30] <sledgeDJ> if all the image does is change it to clicked then why the hell aint it loading the page when the button itself is clicked
[13:28:50] <jphase> a bit out of context, can you create a jsfiddle?
[13:29:04] <tushigushi> hey i have a question about json request, is it the place to ask?
[13:29:20] <jphase> tushigushi: if you're making the request with jQuery, then sure :)
[13:30:35] <sledgeDJ> jphase: i would love to but it is over 2000 lines of horsecrap code
[13:31:04] <jphase> all you need to do is recreate the element in question
[13:31:41] <jphase> you're talking about images and radios and clicking and it's basically nonsensical over IRC without seeing what you're talking about unfortunately
[13:37:19] <tushigushi> I'm actually trying to deal with the response, I'm newbie so question is probably noob ish, but any way. I get response from tumblr, and it has arrays in it, so when I want to put them into div, my chrome console has "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined" error. Here is the line of code :$("#contimg").attr("src",Object.photos[0].alt_sizes[0].url); I'm not sure if i treat arrays right.
[13:38:08] <tushigushi> by them i mean pictures from response, sorry*
[13:48:05] <jphase> tushigushi: Object.photos isn't an object
[13:48:19] <jphase> either that or alt_sizes
[14:09:07] <CloudsDew_> what is the best way to chek if user is on mobile device?
[14:11:32] <decx> http://detectmobilebrowsers.com choose whatever is appropriate
[14:49:23] <wa5ted> can anyone show me an example where there are 2 hidden side menus which pop up and make the main visible contianer smaller
[14:49:27] <wa5ted> the 2 hidden menus are hidden on left and right sides of the main visible container
[16:24:05] <tushigushi> How can i show a set pictures for a certain amount of time each?
[16:26:31] <tushigushi> Story is I got pictures via tumblr api, but my image container shows only the last one (i used  attr("src", pic)), I want to loop through them and show each for few seconds
[20:24:05] <isuldor> I want to bind click() events to button elements that I dynamically created with append(), but it doesn't seem to work. Any advice?

[22:47:52] <Bauer> what is wrong in this .ajax parameter: headers: { Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "http://1.1.1.1/" }, I get unexpected token - error
[23:07:32] <jphase> Bauer: you'll want to add Access-Control-Allow-Origin on the server rather than in your .ajax headers
[23:09:10] <Bauer> jphase: I am not sure that is possible, the server is VMware vcloud login page, and I am trying to do a login button that POSTS to it, in a new browser window...
[23:09:48] <Bauer> tab, not window
[23:10:49] <jphase> Bauer: well the point of that header is to declare where requests can come from. if we were able to pass those headers in our .ajax() header object then we'd be able to hack any ol' service out there. :\
[23:12:19] <Bauer> jphase: hmm I dont see why is it a problem.. How do you suggest I approach the problem described above?
[23:13:32] <jphase> well it's a problem for the reason I just mentioned. not really familiar with modifying the headers on a VMware vcloud login page. Do you have access to the server that serves up that login page (apache/nginx/whatever)?
[23:14:17] <Bauer> jphase: since we are the admins, yes.. but what do you suggest?
[23:14:58] <jphase> Bauer: well if it's served with apache, then you can add that header to either .htaccess or the vhost you're using to serve up the login page, for example
[23:16:58] <Bauer> I dont think it is apache, probably something java related. will see when the vmware admin guy gets here
[23:27:14] <zylophone> how do i select only top-level divs?
[23:29:21] <systemfault> Top level?
[23:29:34] <systemfault> You mean like… ‘body > div’ ?
[23:31:22] <zylophone> ahh, of course, body!
[23:31:33] <zylophone> i was trying just > div but that wasn't successful!
[23:31:45] <zylophone> thanks :)
[23:44:52] <Whiskey> i need some help whit a test casse, how do i make a id, add one 1 or a every 5s?
[23:47:30] <zylophone>  why is this only returning 1? http://jsfiddle.net/NyD3m/1/
[23:51:40] <zylophone> http://jsfiddle.net/NyD3m/2/ is kinda giving a weird result that it's only seeing one div?
[23:52:35] <systemfault> zylophone: Because it gets the .foo inside the node
[23:53:13] <systemfault> And your second example makes no sense.
[23:54:10] <zylophone> in what sense?
[23:54:26] <systemfault> zylophone: The second argument to $ is the “context” node
[23:54:35] <systemfault> You cannot give it “html”
[23:56:09] <zylophone> aye, but even $(str) returns one
[23:57:09] <systemfault> What?
[23:57:16] <systemfault> Have you tried?
[23:57:39] <zylophone> yes
[23:58:00] <zylophone> http://jsfiddle.net/NyD3m/5/
[23:58:14] <systemfault> What do you expect?
[23:58:25] <systemfault> There’s a single .foo that is actually nested.
[23:58:30] <systemfault> So, the answer is one.
[23:58:41] <systemfault> jQuery doesn’t count the starting nodes.
