[00:00:32] <Nomikos> The fact that you really have to work hard to make JS throw errors probably contributed to its popularity
[00:01:14] <Nomikos> mathi: if you put up some example code at jsfiddle we can look
[00:01:25] * Nomikos grabs coffee
[00:01:48] <mathi> var result = objJson.toString().split('@@'); 		var forms = (result.length > 1 ? result[1].split(',') : ''); it will return some form names
[00:02:17] <mathi> but now its return null
[00:03:11] <mathi> nomi any idea
[00:03:22] <initself> if i want to test and see if a selector is even triggering...
[00:03:37] <initself> $('.phone_call').alert('test').popupWindow({
[00:03:39] <initself> would that work?
[00:05:21] <spaceninja> Cork: Maybe it's been working after all, but I just don't see it in the page source?
[00:05:31] <spaceninja> haven't
[00:05:39] <spaceninja> seen
[00:05:54] <Cork> spaceninja: if you mean view source, then ya, its not dynamically updated
[00:06:06] <Cork> you need to look at the dom view of your browser
[00:06:28] <spaceninja> ok, then it must be working, because I got other jquery statements that do work
[00:06:36] <spaceninja> Cork:ok thanks
[00:08:43] <daneover> sup ya'll. I'm working with a full browser background image. would it be better to preload a gif (about 4mb), or to do some image sequencing with jquery/javascript?
[00:09:23] <daneover> probably implementing this for the resizing: http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/
[00:11:53] <daneover> i guess load time is my main concern. would i gain anything by doing some image sequencing with a framework similar to this: http://www.ajaxblender.com/jani.html
[00:12:55] <daneover> or would i be better off just preloading a 4mb gif
[00:13:48] <Nomikos> mathi: back; can you put it up on jsfiddle including the objJson object?
[00:17:54] <mathi> nomi the json object contain form names
[00:19:34] <mathi>  example the obj is like follows "@@4202,Actionable Event,4253,AD Account Sync,4243 etc@@" in the form of obj
[00:20:02] <Nomikos> are those the values or the property names?
[00:20:24] <mathi> thats json object like map id and values
[00:21:15] <ram_> how i creat attractive menu in quary
[00:21:51] <mathi> $.ajax({  		url: 'url', 		success: function(objJson) { 		var result = objJson.toString().split('@@'); 					var forms = (result.length > 1 ? result[1].split(',') : ''); 				});
[00:22:01] <mathi> this is method nomi
[00:22:06] <Nomikos> mathi: do you have firefox?
[00:22:26] <mathi> yes i have
[00:22:36] <Nomikos> can you do objJson.toSource() and put the result in pastebin.com or jsfiddle.net?
[00:23:42] <Nomikos> as long as it's an object you can't split on anything, making it a string with toString() is not helping in this case (as observed), so.. have to know what is in that object
[00:23:50] <Nomikos> structure-wise
[00:24:05] <mathi> nomi i already print the objJson values by console.log(objJson) i send example already
[00:24:25] <Nomikos> yes, but that doesn't show the structure
[00:25:12] <mathi> @@id,formName,id,formName,id,....@@ like this the object
[00:25:45] <mathi> then i split objJson.toString().split('@@')
[00:26:02] <mathi> again i split by ,
[00:26:22] <Nomikos> if it's a JSON object you shouldn't have to split it on anything, you can just run through the property names of the object, and access each value like taht
[00:26:26] <Nomikos> *that
[00:26:41] <Nomikos> your method will fail as soon as a value also contains a comma
[00:27:18] <mathi> ok nomi i understand abd try  by property names
[00:28:23] <mathi> thank you nomi lets try and inform
[00:28:50] <Nomikos> sure thing
[00:45:57] <raj> what is context in jquery?
[00:47:47] <Nomikos> It probably refers to the scope in which a variable (or method) exists, and is usable
[00:49:01] <Nomikos> or it's a bit more abstract maybe..

[01:08:33] <MariusKarthaus> doing $('#checkbox1').attr('checked',0) set the checkbox to ON. This seems very strange to me. http://jsfiddle.net/R4hcd/, any reason why jquery would do this?

[01:15:12] <MariusKarthaus> Cork: thank you,
[01:33:42] <aaairc> does anyone know why this simple example doesn't work?   http://jsfiddle.net/7Nfq7/2/
[01:34:15] <aaairc> i'm trying to use jquery to select a div that has the following as a class name   "02:30:00"
[01:34:22] <Eviltwin> First, that's a terrible class name
[01:34:37] <Eviltwin> Second, read the top of this page: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[01:34:38] <aaairc> are you not able to have a class name with colins in it?
[01:35:04] <mindis|wurk> no
[01:35:26] <mindis|wurk> doesn't take much testing to find that out if you can't be arsed to read about it
[01:36:04] <aaairc> why is it a terrible class name? just because of ":" those?
[01:36:39] <jkarsrud> aaairc: first off, it's not valid
[01:36:49] <jkarsrud> you could use data attributes instead
[01:36:59] <mindis|wurk> it's a class name is not supposed to start with a number
[01:37:49] <aaairc> i have a selector for time, and i need jquery to be able to select the appropriate time on the selector based on a time variable that is passed to it
[01:38:05] <aaairc> so thats why i gave it a class name like that
[01:38:30] <jkarsrud> but you can't have it as a class. use data-something="02:30:00" instead
[01:39:00] <jkarsrud> then you can do $('[data-something="02:30:00"]')
[01:39:23] <mindis|wurk> yeah, that would be significantly simpler than creating valid class names from the time
[01:39:30] <aaairc> oh awesome
[01:39:46] <aaairc> i didn't realize i could do a jquery selector based on something like that
[01:39:58] <beasty> mornings
[01:40:22] <jkarsrud> aaairc: you can select whatever with jquery, they're just css selectors
[01:40:22] <aaairc> if i already have a value set for my options, could it be something like...
[01:41:16] <aaairc> $('option[value="02:30:00"]').attr('selected','selected')
[01:42:11] <aaairc> i didn't realize you could do a css selector on an attr of an element... i was thinking you could only use id and class
[01:43:12] <Cork> you can select on anything thats in dom
[01:43:25] <Cork> there is different amounts of cost doing so though
[01:43:49] <aaairc> i just tested $('option[value="02:30:00"]').attr('selected','selected') and it worked for me. thnx for the help!
[01:43:54] <aaairc> k
[02:22:42] <Xotix> hi, maybe someone can help me on that http://tinyw.in/YATW ?
[02:56:45] <Flo710> hi everybody
[02:56:59] <initself> i'm trying to do opener.location.reload(); and window.close(); on .submit

[02:57:12] <initself> any way around that?
[02:57:14] <zenios> Hello everyone.I have a div which i update every 5 seconds through ajax.This div has some buttons inside.I also attach a click listener on the div to know which button was pressed.The problem i have is that when the content changes through ajax i have a raise condition that the buttons don't get pressed.Any idea how it can be fixed?
[02:57:31] <Flo710> can i use an array/object for properties for animate an element?
[02:58:11] <Flo710> like: properties = new Object(height: "+=200px);
[02:58:24] <Flo710> $('#test').animate(properties, 500);
[02:58:24] <Flo710> ?
[02:58:33] <mindis|wurk> zenios uh, i hope you're using .on('click', yourselector)
[02:58:55] <shwaiil> Q: My profile is Backend Developer, but I've been trying to push myself to Frontend Development. Now, I got some recruiters offering me some interviews for UI developer. I have experience in 2d / 3d animation and some graphic design, but I don't practice it for 2 years now. I'm wondering what type of tasks a UI Dev does ?!?! Thanks
[02:59:07] <antgel_> hi all, see my post at http://jsfiddle.net/LH3Ey/.  i have some html snippets in external .html files to avoid polluting my .js files.  on document ready i load them with get, but other functions fail because the get hasn't returned before they execute. what's the correct pattern for this?  link at http://jsfiddle.net/LH3Ey/
[02:59:40] <zenios>  mindis|wurk this is exactly what i am doing.But i still have the raise condition :(
[03:01:17] <zenios> mindis|wurk, every 5 seconds i update the div with the new buttons.The exact moment where the div is changing the buttons cannot be clicked.
[03:01:34] <mindis|wurk> ah
[03:01:43] <mindis|wurk> that seems like a pretty intense update pace
[03:02:11] <mindis|wurk> i'd probably just cover them with a semitransparent div when i don't want them to be clickable
[03:02:19] <zenios> Its a panel with buttons.
[03:02:32] <zenios> Every second the state my change thats why i have to update every 5 seconds
[03:03:00] <zenios> mindis|wurk, i cannot update the panel every 5 seconds with a semitransparent div.The buttons have to be clickable all the time
[03:03:44] <mindis|wurk> sounds...weird
[03:07:45] <zenios> mindis|wurk, any idea?
[03:08:37] <mindis|wurk> nope. the whole situation sounds strange
[03:10:01] <zenios> why?
[03:13:06] <mindis|wurk> updating buttons through ajax with a timed interval just seems like a very strange thing to do. maybe if we could see it in action it would make more sense
[03:14:34] <chris____> hey, I'd like to use the vmouse* events in jquery mobile but not the rest of the library - anyone got any tips or pointers on how to do this please? :)
[03:26:32] <shal3r> is $.getJSON sorting parsed JSON data by index?
[03:26:50] <Fox`> Why does every jQuery plugin have cardcoded HTML? Surely that's a really bad thing to do?
[03:26:55] <Fox`> hardcoded*
[03:27:19] <mindis|wurk> some things are just pain to do otherwise
[03:29:39] <Fox`> pain in the short term. bigger pain in the long run
[03:30:34] <Fox`> actually it doesn't take any extra effort to use something like handlebars
[03:35:36] <Trisox> if you use handlebars
[03:37:52] <DreamStiffler> hi guys
[03:37:56] <DreamStiffler> i have a html related question
[03:38:16] <DreamStiffler> ok html is alive here so figured id ask there first
[03:38:36] <koszi> anyone know plugin for dynamic css manipulation? something similar to http://tympanus.net/csschange/code/slider/ but more advanced?
[03:38:44] <DreamStiffler> great it says cannot send to channel
[03:38:46] <DreamStiffler> so here i am
[03:38:53] <DreamStiffler> http://jsfiddle.net/aTwzp/
[03:39:02] <DreamStiffler> try to save that to a local html file
[03:39:21] <DreamStiffler> why? coz it doesnt replicate the problem in jsfiddle
[03:39:46] <DreamStiffler> the problem is chrome opens a new tab for link 2
[03:39:54] <DreamStiffler> instead of using the same tab
[03:40:46] <VictorCL> I have a bunch of <a tags inside a div , I need to select the last <a that may have the class "incorrect" or "correct"
[03:41:25] <VictorCL> I was thinking this $(".questionsnav a[class~='correct incorrect']").last().next();
[03:41:27] <VictorCL> but doestn work
[03:43:38] <Cork> DreamStiffler: side not don't have html, head or body in the html section in jsfiddle, it already adds those
[03:43:47] <Cork> DreamStiffler: 2. what does this have to do with jquery?
[03:44:37] <AdTaylor> hey. I was wondering how you guys load your query projects these days? Are you using an AMD loader like require.js or something else?
[03:45:03] <AdTaylor> I love jQuery but there doesn't seem to be a solid base for defining and providing requirements
[03:45:06] <DreamStiffler> it doesnt have to do with jquery(yet maybe) just in case theres a fix using jquery
[03:45:10] <Cork> AdTaylor: mostly just through a script tag in the head
[03:45:55] <Cork> DreamStiffler: the "fix" would be through window.open
[03:46:24] <AdTaylor> Cork: But do you never wish you could define and require in extras for plugins? For example… you have a validation plugin and you could require in a postcode/zip module?
[03:46:52] <Cork> AdTaylor: thats MUCH better handled by server code (and yes i use that)
[03:47:33] <Cork> AdTaylor: adding that code so its constantly loaded and cached in client most of the time requiers less load time then loading it as separat js files
[03:48:17] <Cork> and for really specialized code that needs for a spesific section, i use ajax dataType: 'script'
[03:48:45] <AdTaylor> Cork: completely agree I'm not really talking async loading. More, dependancy management. That extra file doesn't always have to be on the page but occasionally you would like it there
[03:49:22] <Cork> AdTaylor: well if you to requier in js, it IS async
[03:49:29] <raj> Cork, did I lose your interest?
[03:49:33] <Cork> AdTaylor: thats why i said its better to concat them server side
[03:49:34] <raj> =P
[03:49:51] <Cork> raj: no haven't seen any more questions from you
[03:50:29] <raj> oh, I moved the for loop to the onload callback http://paste.ofcode.org/wqxFBeUexFwQ3wmxGFnQq8
[03:50:32] <raj> but still doesn't work
[03:50:43] <Flo710> hey guys, how can i wait for a function to be terminated?
[03:51:03] <Cork> raj: your still using a for loop
[03:51:05] <raj> in fact, no change to the dom when i do that
[03:51:10] <raj> oh, no for loop at all
[03:51:11] <Flo710> iÄm creating HTML elements and afterwards i want to animate them. but i need to wait for them to be created
[03:51:21] <Flo710> so, what to do?
[03:51:36] <Cork> raj: for(i=0;i<data.files.length;i++)
[03:51:49] <blackspotwiggins> Flo710, js is not multithreaded
[03:52:03] <blackspotwiggins> Flo710, everything runs sequentially
[03:52:35] <AdTaylor> Cork: require.js was an example. I've tried it and don't feel its the best solution for the reasons you've specified. I'd prefer to send all files concat down the wire. I would also like have sections of the plugins in different files to improve that build process. but sep management becomes an issue. Just wondering if there were any patterns to allow this… I guess I'm talking about a safe plugin extend pattern
[03:52:46] <muszek> hi... http://paste2.org/p/1939679 <-- I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: Object <a href="/users"></a> has no method 'trigger'"... why?  how can I make it work?
[03:53:05] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: yeah but i start the function createElements() and in the next line i start the function animateElements() but nothing happens
[03:53:16] <Cork> AdTaylor: i think your mixing the consepts
[03:53:17] <quicksilver> muszek: you want var a = $('<a href="/users"></a>');
[03:53:25] <blackspotwiggins> Flo710, you have made a mistake then
[03:53:26] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: if i set a timeout for the animateElements() it works
[03:53:32] <Cork> AdTaylor: file management should be server side, so there can't be a pattern
[03:53:34] <muszek> quicksilver: thanks, I'll try it
[03:53:50] <Cork> AdTaylor: you need server code that you either run manually, or runs when the client requests it
[03:53:57] <quicksilver> muszek: you call jQuery functions on jQuery objects, not strings.
[03:54:03] <Cork> AdTaylor: that gives you the js file you want to give to the client
[03:54:23] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: can i show u the code on jsfiddle?
[03:54:29] <Cork> AdTaylor: what i mean is, requerment management should be a server issue, not a client/javascript one
[03:56:22] <muszek> quicksilver: still doesn't work... now it simply does nothing ( http://paste2.org/p/1939682 )
[03:57:13] <muszek> quicksilver: I also tried something like http://paste2.org/p/1939683 and it doesn't do anyting either (console.log prints the element)
[03:57:43] <AdTaylor> Cork: Yep, I get that. But to ensure the dependancies are loaded in the correct order — maybe I want  to load `plugin.extend` into the middle of `plugin` — I would need to have a dep management protocol… rather than just loading as waterfall.
[03:58:00] <quicksilver> muszek: "doesn't do anything" - does the link get inserted to the document?
[03:58:18] <tocka> Morning :)
[03:58:20] <Cork> AdTaylor: yup, a server script that parses and renders the js
[03:58:29] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: http://jsfiddle.net/D5UrL/
[03:58:43] <MariusKarthaus> If I use $.ajax to post this object {n:null,s:'null'}, the resulting request does not represent the fact that null !== 'null' , one is null and the other one is a string. How do I tell jquery to encode the post object in such a way that I can decode the true dataset on the serverside ?
[03:58:46] <quicksilver> muszek: trigger doesn't fire underlying browser behaviour - it fires event handlers.
[03:59:02] <blackspotwiggins> Flo710, what the.. ?
[03:59:04] <muszek> quicksilver: all I need is to go to that address ('/users').  window.location.href doesn't pass referer in IE, that's why I'm trying this approach
[03:59:09] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: important thing is this.loadXML; and system.start(); start has to wait till loadXML(); is completely finished
[03:59:18] <muszek> quicksilver: oh...
[03:59:20] <quicksilver> muszek: if you're expecting it to follow the link it won't
[03:59:37] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: string has no way to encode null
[03:59:40] <blackspotwiggins> ?ajax101 @ Flo710
[03:59:40] <bot-t> Flo710, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[03:59:45] <muszek> quicksilver: how can I trigger following a link?
[03:59:48] <blackspotwiggins> and dont write your custom ajax code..
[03:59:53] <AdTaylor> Cork: For a large site that seems incredibly intensive — also means I wouldn't get to leverage any browser caching.
[04:00:02] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: only way is to leav the variable empty when its null
[04:00:26] <Cork> AdTaylor: not really, it just means you shouldn't modify the js depending on what page you load
[04:00:48] <blackspotwiggins> Flo710, there is no createElements() in that fiddle anyhow. but it's horrible mess and you should feel bad
[04:00:49] <mindis|wurk> Cork sorry to bother you again but could you give any hints how to insert html at caret? i'm trying to manually create paragraphing and if i use range.createContextualFragment('</p><p>'); to create a new "linebreak", it ends up creating a new <p></p> inside the current paragraph instead of terminating the old one and creating a starting tag for a new one
[04:00:55] <MariusKarthaus> Cork:  I'm not trying to 'encode null in a string', i want the server to  be able to know if the data posted is the "string null" entered by the user in the post field, or that the posted field is actually null
[04:01:19] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: i know this is a mess, this is just experimenting.
[04:01:37] <muszek> quicksilver: I'm trying to achieve this: http://dracoblue.net/dev/referer-with-documentlocation-is-broken-in-internet-explorer/145/
[04:01:40] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: there isn't really a way
[04:01:49] <quicksilver> muszek: not sure, try a FORM with method GET?
[04:01:51] <Cork> ?eval null.toString()
[04:01:52] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: null has no properties
[04:02:02] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: the create Elements() is in loadXML();
[04:02:08] <raj> Cork, still not working http://paste.ofcode.org/38Ckd352qTswp3jjSimMQTe
[04:02:44] <blackspotwiggins> Flo710, be a dear and learn how to use ajax properly first.
[04:02:46] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: look at syste.load()
[04:02:47] <Cork> raj: you still trying to do it sync
[04:03:07] <raj> i am?
[04:03:15] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: i just copied the ajax function from somewhere, thats not important to me right now
[04:03:21] <MariusKarthaus> Cork: wow that is bad, that would imply that is is impossible to communicate a javascript object to the server over HTTP POST??
[04:03:26] <Cork> raj: line 16 to 28 needs to move into onload (after line 14)
[04:03:27] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: sure i will improve this
[04:03:30] <DreamStiffler> Cork: thanks...any idea why is chrome behaving this way? and just wondering if there is a js/jquery-less fix to this? i mean htmlish?
[04:03:48] <blackspotwiggins> Flo710, and a good day to you, sir. your problem is you dont know how ajax works
[04:03:59] <Cork> DreamStiffler: never fiddled much with target, if i remember correctly its not standardized
[04:04:03] <DreamStiffler> Cork: just for knowledge as the fix you gave worked..if only i tried it out first
[04:04:12] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: maybe i don't know it, but thats not the problem.
[04:04:20] <ThemNuts> sup guys, i got a jQuery ui autocomplete that works splendid but how do i apply this on a select input?
[04:04:21] <Cork> DreamStiffler: so the thing your using is legacy, and opera, chrome and safari has much less of those
[04:04:37] <DreamStiffler> Cork:Thing?
[04:04:37] <blackspotwiggins> Flo710, yes it is.
[04:04:40] <shwaiil> Q: I'm reading jQuery plugin authoring and it's not clear to me how "this" is being returned in plugin context, please see ( http://pastie.org/private/i2tgo3kzawbrilolkaikba ). I can see that "this" is wrapped in "$( this )", but i'm not sure why he's doing like that. Any help ? Thanks
[04:04:44] <shwaiil> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[04:04:45] <ThemNuts> normally i do: $('#zipid').val(ui.item.CustomerZipcodeId);
[04:04:55] <Cork> mindis|wurk: sorry no i don't remember that right now
[04:04:57] <shwaiil> var $this = $(this);
[04:05:01] <Flo710> blackspotwiggins: for my timing problem?
[04:05:10] <Cork> DreamStiffler: target
[04:05:28] <mindis|wurk> Cork darn. well, thanks anyway
[04:05:37] <DreamStiffler> Cork: u saying its depreceated?
[04:05:46] <Cork> DreamStiffler: its used to target frames
[04:05:51] <Cork> it was its main use
[04:06:06] <Cork> what your trying to do is not standardised at all
[04:06:17] <Cork> later _blank and _new _top was added
[04:06:31] <Cork> but its still mainly for frame use

[04:07:14] <bot-t> raj, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:07:55] <DreamStiffler> thanks cork
[04:08:20] <aaairc> is there a way to use alert() to print out the contents of a javascript object?
[04:08:33] <aaairc> so i can see all the name value pairs within it?
[04:08:36] <JeppeMariager> hey guys… I was wondering if anyone here can help me with a problem i have with $.get()? I get HTTP 200 for my url, but it doesn't grab the content of the url for some reason
[04:08:44] <raj> aaairc, use console.log(myobject)
[04:08:48] <beasty> bah
[04:08:51] <JeppeMariager> (you can see it here: http://videos.mediaprovider.se/play.php?file=1.36622)
[04:08:52] <beasty> mobile development--
[04:09:14] <aaairc> raj: that will work better than alert? because alert right now gives me Object object
[04:09:21] <raj> yes
[04:09:31] <aaairc> k thx i'll try
[04:19:25] <JeppeMariager> no one? :(
[04:19:41] <Ad0> hey, I have a table where I have 2 trs per "row". I do closest('tr') right now to get the first tr, but I also want the next one
[04:22:02] <raj> brb
[04:22:25] <antihero> hello, if my json returns htmlentities encoded, then jquery autocomplete then re-escapes them
[04:22:29] <antihero> how do I prevent this
[04:23:15] <antgel_> hi all, see my post at http://jsfiddle.net/LH3Ey/.  i have some html snippets in external .html files to avoid polluting my .js files.  on document ready i load them with get, but other functions fail because the get hasn't returned before they execute. what's the correct pattern for this?  link at http://jsfiddle.net/LH3Ey/
[04:23:30] <MariusKarthaus> Cork: my solution for the jquery post encoding issue -> I'm now using json2.js and JSON.stringify() to pre-encode the POST data, not leaving it up to jquery. This way the object types are send with the data properly and can be decoded serverside.
[04:23:47] <antgel_> if it's not clear what i'm trying to do, i'm happy to clarify if you tell me what isn't clear
[04:24:33] <Ad0> found out
[04:24:39] <Ad0> first.add(first.next())
[04:24:40] <Ad0> :)
[04:25:41] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[04:25:52] <Double_Rainbow> how to i open a link in a modal window ?
[04:27:43] <antihero> MariusKarthaus: does this apply to my question?
[04:28:33] <raj> Cork, I've got it live for you
[04:28:38] <raj> may I pm?
[04:29:00] <nFFF> antgel, AJAX is asynchronous
[04:29:08] <nFFF> you can make i synchronous
[04:29:22] <nFFF> or use defferreds
[04:30:05] <MariusKarthaus> antihero: no I had a problem the other way around, where I was sending a javascript objec to the server using $.ajax, but apearantly jquery has no way of properly encoding objects and thus the information about the difference between a regular string with the content "null" and an actual null-value is lost.
[04:30:51] <nFFF> antgel_, I also see no reason why you can't put make_accordion within the callback of the request
[04:31:24] <nFFF> if the function is only going to be called from within the callback -> move it there
[04:31:45] <antihero> ah
[04:31:53] <antihero> my issue is that I'm getting encoded stuff from the server (good)
[04:32:09] <antihero> but then jquery ui does something odd and escapes it
[04:33:59] <asso> ciao
[04:34:01] <asso> !list
[04:34:13] <twoface> Hi. I am using dragndrop for a number of divs inside another div, that is set as "containment". I can't drag to the bottom of list, due to this. How do one normally work around this?
[04:34:20] <SamK1975> I need to find all descendants of element E which have class A up to and including class B but no further.
[04:34:55] <SamK1975> E.find('.A') will not stop at '.B'
[04:36:10] <SamK1975> E.nextUntil('.B','.A') will not select elements with class '.B' but is otherwise perfect
[04:37:38] <SamK1975> (i.e. the case where a descendant has class .B and class .A)
[04:38:08] <nFFF> $('.foo').slice($('.foo .A'),$('.foo .B')); ?
[04:38:32] <nFFF> maybe need to add something to slcie slectors to get their index
[04:38:42] <nFFF> .index()
[04:39:26] <nFFF> Also find would be faster
[04:40:01] <nFFF> $('.foo').slice($('.foo').find('.A').index(),$('.foo').find('.B').index());
[04:40:49] <SamK1975> interesting never used slice will give a go ta
[04:45:04] <antihero> if I have a function that does getJSON
[04:45:06] <antihero> inside it
[04:45:12] <antihero> how to I block and then return the data of that?
[04:45:24] <antihero> basically I want to "wrap" getjson
[04:46:04] <Xotix> Can someone please take a look at this? http://tinyw.in/MUDq Also, if i have a draggable li, he got some parent from which he inherits css etc. Is it possible to change his parent so the dragged item inherits the  css from it's new parent? Hope that was clear.
[04:46:41] <antihero> in order to encode the htmlentities
[04:46:42] <antgel_> nFFF: hi, thanks for the answer, the make_accordion() is used in other callbacks, i'll do a more detailed example.  will also investigate synchronous / defferreds.  i don't really care that .get uses AJAX, and it is positively unhelpful that it's asynchronous.  all i want is for my .get calls to return before the rest of my js executes
[04:46:44] <antihero> or something:(
[04:49:04] <nFFF> SamK1975, $('.foo').children().slice($('.foo').find('.A').index(), $('.foo').find('.B').index());
[04:49:24] <nFFF> antgel, make them synchronous then
[04:49:53] <nFFF> ?ajax
[04:49:55] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:49:58] <nFFF> look at async:
[04:50:04] <nFFF> ?ajax async
[04:50:06] <bot-t> nFFF, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:50:21] <antgel_> nFFF: okay, thanks.  is there another way to store the html from my .html files in js variables?  or is .get (synchronous) the correct way to go about it?
[04:50:30] <SamK1975> nFFF: doesn't .children only get the first level children? I need this to work on descendants
[04:50:33] <nFFF> Ok, well you can turn async: false
[04:50:57] <nFFF> SamK1975, then find('*')
[04:51:35] <nFFF> $('.foo').find('*').slice($('.foo').find('.A').index(), $('.foo').find('.B').index());
[04:51:44] <nFFF> Theres probably a much more elegant solution :D
[04:52:05] <nFFF> You could probably use $.map, it might be faster
[04:52:55] <quicksilver> $('.foo').find('.A').index() will return its index in its parent, not its index in the entire list of descendants?
[04:53:22] <quicksilver> var allelts = $('.foo').find('*');
[04:53:24] <nFFF> yea thats what he wants
[04:53:51] <quicksilver> allelts.slice(allelts.index($('.foo').find('.A')), allelts.index($('.foo').find('.B')));
[04:53:54] <quicksilver> that is not my understanding.
[04:54:01] <quicksilver> he needs the index in the list of all descendants
[04:54:08] <quicksilver> not the index in its immediate parent
[04:54:13] <quicksilver> or that's how it seemed to me.
[04:54:26] <quicksilver> anyhow, there is a way to call 'index' on a collection, like that ^^
[04:55:26] <raj> Cork, still around?
[04:58:07] <SamK1975> yes I need to search all descendants of an element for a class, but stopping at another class (not searching its children)
[04:58:37] <SamK1975> but handle the case where the class stopped at needs to be included (because it has the search class)
[04:58:47] <SamK1975> hard to explain :)
[04:59:48] <SamK1975> the slice stuff doesn't seem to be working but still fiddling around with it
[05:06:10] <AnonyCon> hello
[05:06:15] <antihero> I wish bloody jquery ui autocomplete let you override any of its funcitons
[05:06:33] <AnonyCon> i'm having some trouble with validate(), can anyone lend a hand?
[05:08:25] <nFFF> SamK1975, why isn't splice working?
[05:09:02] <SamK1975> nFFF: just because I dont understand it yet, hang on drawing a picture
[05:09:20] <nFFF> it simply reduce a set of elements to a subset based on two index's
[05:12:14] <nFFF> >eval
[05:12:18] <nFFF> >>eval
[05:12:19] <AnonyCon> can anyone with a good heart help me understand the validate() method
[05:12:21] <AnonyCon> ?
[05:12:27] <nFFF> is there a bot to eval in here? :<
[05:12:28] <nFFF> ?eval
[05:12:29] <bot-t> nFFF: Syntax: ? eval <javascript code>
[05:12:36] <nFFF> ?eval var x = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6];  x = x.slice(0,2); x.length;​
[05:12:40] <bot-t> nFFF: 2
[05:13:04] <nFFF> ?eval var x = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6];  x = x.slice(0,2); x[3];
[05:13:05] <bot-t> nFFF: undefined
[05:13:13] <nFFF> SamK1975, doe that help?
[05:13:14] <AnonyCon> ;)
[05:13:21] <AnonyCon> seems legit
[05:14:29] <SamK1975> nFFF: yes, it doesnt work as is but i'm just debugging and trying to figure out the slices
[05:14:35] <SamK1975> heres a picture:
[05:14:37] <SamK1975> http://imagepaste.nullnetwork.net/viewimage.php?id=3505
[05:14:54] <nFFF> Ok and what are you trying to do?
[05:15:01] <SamK1975> yellow=want selected
[05:15:29] <SamK1975> note how the lowest '.A' is not selected as it is a descendant of a '.B'
[05:15:40] <nFFF> so you need all 'A's between 'B' ?
[05:16:17] <SamK1975> yes, but including the element that has classes .B *and*.A
[05:16:27] <nFFF> Sure
[05:19:15] <nFFF> so: var els = $('.B').get(0).find('*');  els.slice(0, els.find('.B').index() );
[05:19:18] <nFFF> that might work
[05:19:41] <nFFF> wait no it won't
[05:19:54] <nFFF> that will just get all elements
[05:20:26] <nFFF> var els = $('.B').get(0).find('*'); els =  els.slice(0, els.find('.B').index() ); els = els.find('A.');
[05:22:28] <nFFF> obviously laat selecotr is '.A' not 'A.' :>
[05:24:04] <SamK1975> nFFF: very cool, thinking it over
[05:24:38] <Cork> nFFF: get(0).find('*') won't work
[05:24:43] <Cork> get returns dom not jquery
[05:25:01] <nFFF> Ok, whats the correct way?
[05:25:08] <Cork> eq(0)
[05:25:09] <nFFF> you could just wrap it in $()
[05:25:12] <nFFF> ok thanks
[05:25:20] <nFFF> always get confused between the two
[05:25:27] <Cork> but what are you trying to do?
[05:25:53] <nFFF> SamK1975, needs to get all descendants of .B, up until descendant .B, that have class .A
[05:26:03] <SamK1975> Cork: http://imagepaste.nullnetwork.net/viewimage.php?id=3505
[05:26:12] <SamK1975> select all yellow circles
[05:26:43] <SamK1975> i.e. all elements with class '.A' under root but stopping at elements of class '.B'
[05:26:50] <Nomikos> $('.A') :3
[05:27:17] <Cork> so $('.A').preAll('.B') ?
[05:27:23] <Cork> *so $('.A').prevAll('.B') ?
[05:27:26] <Nomikos> (oh wait, that selects one too many I guess)
[05:27:30] <Cork> uh...
[05:27:32] <SamK1975> (and including the element that has both class '.A' and '.B'
[05:27:33] <Cork> *so $('.A:first').prevAll('.B') ?
[05:28:44] <LukeNukem> how to find out the rendered content on an html page?
[05:28:49] <SamK1975> Cork: do you mean '.B:first' ?
[05:28:53] <Cork> ah all decentend down to b hmm
[05:29:06] <Cork> SamK1975: didn't see your picture when i wrote that
[05:29:08] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: $('body').html() ?
[05:29:21] <LukeNukem> Nomikos, that returns the html code, i dont want the html code
[05:29:56] <durre> I'm trying to make a jsonp request over https. before I debug anymore, is it possible to do? :)
[05:30:05] <cake1> how can we activate jquery post on a menu link
[05:30:35] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: you want the content but not as html?
[05:30:51] <nFFF> Cork whats wrong with: var els = $('.B').eq(0).find('*'); els =  els.slice(0, els.find('.B').index() ); els = els.find('.A');
[05:31:00] <LukeNukem> Nomikos, yes, in basic text. Say im on a webpage that has the html <body><p>Welcome to my site</p></body>
[05:31:08] <LukeNukem> i want to fetch 'welcome to my site'
[05:31:21] <Cork> nFFF: that won't find all decentent
[05:31:27] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: $('body').text() ?
[05:31:38] <Cork> only all decentent thats earlier in the dom then the first B
[05:31:45] <quicksilver> SamK1975: (Cork, nFFF) how about $('.A').not($('.B .A'))
[05:31:53] <LukeNukem> Nomikos, returns html code
[05:31:59] <quicksilver> based on SamK1975's picture.
[05:31:59] <Nomikos> well, it shouldn't
[05:32:11] <LukeNukem> one second
[05:32:15] <Cork> quicksilver: they'r all children of a b
[05:32:16] <Nomikos> or .. hn, I might be looking at the wrong window here
[05:32:22] <nFFF> Cork, won't that code get all 'A' inbetween the two 'B' 's?
[05:32:51] <quicksilver> hmm yes so select that top element first
[05:32:54] <Cork> $(this).find('.A:not(.B), :not(.B) .A') should work though
[05:32:59] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: no, I'm getting text without tags here, just a buttload of whitespace as well, trim() would be in order
[05:33:39] <Cork> nFFF: ya <div b><div a><div b/></div><div a/ (not this one)></div>
[05:34:24] <Cork> bah.. no that wouldn't work...
[05:34:35] <Cork> i don't think you can chail :not so...
[05:34:50] <LukeNukem> Nomikos, well im doing that on this website www.9gag.com and well it um
[05:34:53] <LukeNukem> returns a but load of tags
[05:35:01] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: with text() ?
[05:35:16] <nFFF> Corey
[05:35:18] <nFFF> Cork
[05:35:18] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/YfkMD/
[05:35:19] <Cork> SamK1975: $(this).find(':not(.B) .A').not('.B') should do it
[05:35:28] <LukeNukem> Nomikos, yes
[05:35:33] <LukeNukem> on my fiddle it works just fine
[05:35:43] <SamK1975> Cork: thanks will give it a spin
[05:35:45] <nFFF> He needs to reduce the set to between the two .B classes surely?
[05:35:59] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: hm, I guess I tried only on pages that actually include jQuery library
[05:36:21] <LukeNukem> Nomikos, um, i do php to fetch the 9gag page to my server
[05:36:25] <Cork> nFFF: wasn't it children of child b elements?
[05:36:29] <LukeNukem> so then i have the html like a page on my server
[05:36:35] <Cork> (that shouldn't be listed)
[05:36:37] <LukeNukem> so it has jquery too since i have a config file which has jquery
[05:36:46] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: ah right, why not use strip_tags() then?
[05:37:01] <LukeNukem> let me try that
[05:37:07] <LukeNukem> btw you said white space stripping ?
[05:37:08] <Nomikos> that's php btw :)
[05:37:13] <LukeNukem> i know
[05:37:17] <Nomikos> yeah, but that doesn't apply I think
[05:37:19] <Xotix> I'm having problems with draggable which come from a container which has position:fixed; well described here: http://tinyw.in/MUDq
[05:37:22] <LukeNukem> is there something in jquery that gets rid of whitespace
[05:37:23] <nFFF> Cork, he wants from what I understand:  get all descendants of first .B, up until next descendant .B, that have class .A
[05:37:32] <LukeNukem> cos i tried on another page and it works fine,but whitespace are annoying
[05:37:52] <Cork> nFFF: the image doesn't look like that
[05:37:56] <Cork> well well see
[05:38:04] <Nomikos> well, $.trim(str) as well, but only leading and trailing
[05:38:18] <Cork> *well, will see
[05:38:19] <Nomikos> php has trim() as well, naturally
[05:38:24] <nFFF> yea perhaps
[05:38:25] <LukeNukem> yep
[05:38:57] <Nomikos> php also has some DOM extensions that you might be able to use
[05:39:06] <Nomikos> but that's for another channel (and a more awake me)
[05:39:18] <LukeNukem> Nomikos, looks fine > alert.trim(title);?
[05:39:28] <LukeNukem> Nomikos, i use dom load to fetch the file to my server ^_^
[05:39:43] <Nomikos> alert($.trim(title)) I think
[05:39:55] <Nomikos> or console.log($.trim(title))
[05:40:09] <Cork> nFFF: the first line i gave would do what you said, but in much less code
[05:41:08] <Cork> nFFF: $(this).children('.B').first().prevAll('.A')
[05:41:44] <fRAiLtY-> I have a div with 2 tables in. The tables contain different data. How can I hide one of them and show the other depending on a drop-down value? So if drop-down value 1 is selected, show table 1, and vice-versa? I have some jquery code but not sure how to do it
[05:42:40] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: $('table').hide().eq($(this).val()).show()
[05:42:48] <Cork> (this is the select element)
[05:43:14] <Xotix> Cork, i have a ul which has position: fixed. you can drag the content of its li. if you scroll up/down while dragging this element, it ehaves very strange. http://tinyw.in/BLrg click on show at newsletter 313. Maybe you know why this happens?
[05:44:40] <Cork> Xotix: "$ is not defined"
[05:45:26] <Xotix> Cork, what browser are you using?
[05:45:42] <LukeNukem> Nomikos, ok i can get the stuff out of it, now if there is javascript in the doc that comes in too
[05:45:45] <LukeNukem> how can i get rid of the javascript?
[05:46:06] <Cork> Xotix: http://nlt-templater.pascal.xiag.ch/resources/js/lib/jquery-1.7.js => un reachable
[05:47:03] <Cork> Xotix: and to answer your question ff10-14, opera, chromium chrome (win, linux), ie 7-9
[05:47:05] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: hrm. I'd guess DOM functions are best here, you should be able to tell the PHP DOM object to remove script tags
[05:47:19] <LukeNukem> Nomikos, okay so after that use jquery to get the content right?
[05:47:22] <Xotix> Cork interesting. Wrong permissiosn probably. I'll check that
[05:47:23] <nFFF> Cork, yea it would seem that line is the same thing but shorter, would that include the last nodes though?
[05:47:49] <nFFF>  $(this).children('.B').first() is a needed node
[05:47:57] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: I'm not sure what the best way is to get only visible text from a html document this way
[05:48:02] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Here's my jquery. On selection of the drop-down I want it to switch tables based on the value of the drop-down. Presumably the tables need different id's or something also?
[05:48:13] <Cork> nFFF: no up until not including the .B
[05:48:15] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: try ##php?
[05:48:19] <Cork> thats what he said
[05:48:47] <nFFF> <SamK1975> yes, but including the element that has classes .B *and*.A
[05:48:56] <nFFF> which is the last node
[05:49:30] <Cork> nFFF: the last .A child before the first child .B
[05:50:03] <SamK1975> sorry someone came in.. reading back..
[05:51:08] <Xotix> Cork try now please
[05:51:09] <Cork> SamK1975: i think we need a defined specification of what elements you want :)
[05:51:29] <Cork> Server not found
[05:51:53] <Cork> doesn't look like you have it in your public dns
[05:52:44] <SamK1975> well, all elements of class .A up to and including any element of class .B (that is also class .A) but no further
[05:54:31] <Cork> SamK1975: is up to .B tree elements or children?
[05:54:59] <Cork> that is, do you want to exclude elements that has a second .B as parent
[05:55:11] <Cork> or children that has another child before them that has the class .B
[05:55:14] <nFFF> yes he does
[05:55:19] <Cork> lol
[05:55:25] <nFFF> exclude elements of second .B
[05:55:40] <nFFF> getting crazy in here today, heads spinning :D
[05:55:46] <Cork> then $(this).find(':not(.B) .A').not('.B') is the answer
[05:55:55] <SamK1975> good mental work out :)
[05:56:13] <ShawnRisk> how come this code loads when I load the page, but when I use a lightbox solution this code doesn't load a all?  http://pastebin.com/vHUJAMjZ  The js file is in the header.
[05:56:25] <nFFF> $(this) == $('.B').eq(0) ??
[05:56:26] <Cork> you might be able to move the .not into the selector too
[05:56:48] <Cork> $(this) is the parent .B that it all starts from
[05:56:51] <SamK1975> Cork: does that select the bigger yellow node?
[05:56:56] <SamK1975> (.B .A)
[05:56:57] <nFFF> Yea
[05:56:59] <Xotix> Cork go to http://test.pmueller.dev.xiag.ch/ delete cache and click on show at newsletter 313. redirection as wrong… sry :)
[05:57:59] <SamK1975> okay let me try it
[05:58:02] <SamK1975> cheers
[05:58:22] <nFFF> Cork, on a side problem, why does my solution, not work http://jsfiddle.net/YfkMD/ the last find('.A') isn't returning any objects
[05:59:16] <Cork> nFFF: index() isn't the array list index
[05:59:23] <Cork> its the position in the dom child list
[05:59:44] <nFFF> fuark
[06:01:54] <kingmilo> Hi all. I am trying to post the contents of my textarea, the mechanics of the .post() seem to be working fine but for the life of me i just cannot pass the contents of the <textarea>, could someone please assist: http://pastie.org/3593302 many thanks.
[06:04:11] <Cork> kingmilo: that syntax is invalid
[06:04:18] <Cork> you need to have a name on your value
[06:04:18] <Xotix> Cork, probably the dragged element behaves strange because it's parent has position: fixed; so the calculation of the scrolling gets wrong. Can i somehow *disconnect" the dragged element from it's parent? Make it relative to the normal page?
[06:04:26] <Cork> like {text:txt}
[06:05:44] <Cork> Xotix: your talking about the lowest element in there or?
[06:06:06] <kingmilo> Thanks Cork, does the {text... represent what the post would be expecting, so if it were html then {html: txt} ?
[06:06:18] <Cork> no
[06:06:24] <Cork> its what the server gets the value as
[06:06:35] <Cork> in php that would be $_GET['text']
[06:06:49] <Cork> oh sorry your doing post
[06:06:59] <Cork> so $_POST['text']
[06:07:05] <Xotix> Cork hover over the blue bar at the left, take any element and scroll.
[06:07:36] <Cork> ah
[06:07:44] <Cork> Xotix: and what doesn't work?
[06:07:55] * Cork nods
[06:07:58] <Cork> scrolling
[06:08:42] <Xotix> Cork, if you scroll, while the element is dragged, it calculates the position of the element wrong. Probably because you drag it out of an element which got position: fixed;
[06:08:45] <kingmilo> Cork, so on my add.php page i have $result = $_POST['editor'] because I want to fetch that value, so in my jquery do I need to change it to:  $.post("add.php",{editor: txt},function(result){...
[06:09:29] <ShawnRisk> how come this code loads when I load the page, but when I use a lightbox solution this code doesn't load a all?  http://pastebin.com/vHUJAMjZ  The js file is in the header.
[06:11:32] <rroelofs> ShawnRisk: There's no way to tell based you what you have pasted.
[06:11:42] <SamK1975> whats the best way to see the results of a jquery expression in JSFIDDLE?
[06:11:47] <Cork> Xotix: you need to set container for draggable
[06:11:55] <Cork> Xotix: its offset it from the fixed element
[06:12:05] <bed777> hi guys
[06:12:48] <Xotix> Cork, what? The calcualtion gets wrong because of the position: fixed, it's relative to it's container, right? I have to change that, right? but how?
[06:13:08] <ShawnRisk> rroelofs: all I am doing is loading an ajax lightbox and want some jquery code that is in a that pastebin (is a js file) within the header to load also.
[06:13:17] <bed777> Why this code is not working ? http://dpaste.com/hold/716348/
[06:13:45] <bed777> http://dpaste.com/hold/716349/
[06:14:10] <Xotix> bed777, theres a , missing on the first element
[06:14:41] <bed777> it's a my mistake
[06:14:52] <bed777> the code don't generate any error.. this is the correct code that i have:
[06:15:06] <bed777> http://dpaste.com/hold/716351/
[06:15:17] <bed777> Why is not change my background?
[06:15:20] <Xotix> bed777 anyway for static css, use an css file.
[06:15:33] <bed777> a class css?
[06:17:01] <rroelofs> ShawnRisk: My point is your pastebin doesn't include the code that is causing the problem.  Problems like this often require a live demo to debug.  certainly more code in the paste would help
[06:17:03] <bed777> Xotix, you mean css class? :)
[06:17:09] <Cork> Xotix: sorry its appendTo you need to set http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[06:17:36] <Cork> Xotix: you should set the body or document has parent for the helper
[06:18:07] <ShawnRisk> rroelofs: right
[06:18:13] <Cork> Xotix: as it is, it tries to scroll the element, but thats not posible cause the element its part of doesn't scroll
[06:19:06] <Xotix> bed77 if the css doesn't change then put it in a normal css file. http://jsfiddle.net/P3Dc2/ you got document ready?
[06:19:16] <ShawnRisk> rroelofs: trying something and if this doesn't work, can I pm you the link?
[06:19:33] <bed777> Xotix now If I use a class work
[06:19:33] <rroelofs> ShawnRisk: yes
[06:19:38] <bed777> $("body").addClass('bg001');
[06:19:47] <bed777> but, Can I animate it?
[06:19:50] <Xotix> Cork ah i was looking for something like that! Thanks. hope that works fine :)
[06:20:24] <bed777> jQuery UI :(
[06:20:26] <Xotix> bed77 what kind of animation?
[06:20:38] <kingmilo> Cork, thanks! I finally got it, you put me on the right path, much appreciated.
[06:21:18] <Cork> kingmilo: np
[06:22:40] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I have this: http://pastie.org/3593255 Do I need my 2 tables to have different ID's ?
[06:22:54] <shwaiil> Q: whats the diference between $( this ) and just "this" ? Tks
[06:23:26] <Xotix> Cork thanks a lot !!
[06:23:50] <Martz_> heya all - anyone knows how i can put jquery mobile code online?
[06:24:11] <Martz_> i mean as an example to ask questions about
[06:24:23] <Cork> shwaiil: $(this) is the dom element wrapped in a jquery object
[06:24:40] <Cork> shwaiil: this is just a variable pointing to the current dom element
[06:24:55] <ShawnRisk> rroelofs: did you get my pm?
[06:25:09] <ShawnRisk> I just saw your pm sorry
[06:26:31] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: 1. replace $ with jQuery ( ;) )
[06:26:40] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: that was how you explaind it yes
[06:26:51] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: wasn't that what you wanted to do?
[06:26:55] <Xotix> Cork you even solved a second problem woohoo :P
[06:27:07] <Cork> :)
[06:29:28] <Martz_> anyone knows using the 'float' css proporty in this technique: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html - bugs?
[06:33:44] <Martz_> damn
[06:34:11] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: What I said/meant was that I have 2 tables with different data in. I have a drop-down with 2 values in. I want to display only the table corresponding to the drop-down value dynamincally
[06:34:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you mean database tables?
[06:34:58] <fRAiLtY-> Nah, just tables of data, html tables. They're already rendered
[06:35:20] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: where do you have them?
[06:35:29] <Cork> in page, in a variable or??
[06:35:32] <fRAiLtY-> On my page
[06:35:43] <fRAiLtY-> I just want to hide 1 and show 1 depending on a value
[06:36:09] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: then i would position them where i want them to show, hide the one/both that i don't want visible
[06:36:18] <Cork> and then add a class on them
[06:36:46] <fRAiLtY-> they're dynamically created though
[06:36:56] <fRAiLtY-> I can assign them seperate ID's or somethng?
[06:36:57] <Cork> by js?
[06:37:03] <fRAiLtY-> php
[06:37:05] <SamK1975> Cork: hey just trying your solution in jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/b6DJQ/1/
[06:37:12] <Cork> then they'r not really dynamic :)
[06:37:24] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: just add a common class on them
[06:37:26] <adac> on an ajax request I do this: "data: 'selected=' +  $(this).find(':selected').text()," how can I add asecond parameter here?
[06:37:34] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: something like class="extended-info"
[06:37:39] <fRAiLtY-> They already have a class, "matrix"
[06:38:05] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: then do $('table.matrix').hide().eq($(this).val()).show()
[06:38:16] <Cork> that should do all you need
[06:38:31] <fRAiLtY-> But how's that going to know which one to show and which one to hide?
[06:38:49] <Cork> $('table.matrix') selects them both
[06:38:58] <Cork> .hide() hides all of them
[06:39:16] <Cork> .eq($(this).val()) selects the one matching the one selected in the selectbox
[06:39:22] <Cork> and .show() shows that one
[06:39:32] <Martz_> Can anyone tell me how i can fix the bug here? http://jsfiddle.net/4Bgx7/133/
[06:39:39] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the value on the options should be 0,1,2,3,4... though
[06:39:52] <fRAiLtY-> The values of the drop-downs are strings
[06:39:58] <SamK1975> Cork: seems to be doing exactly the wrong thing! which is promising
[06:40:11] <Cork> adac: asecond?
[06:40:17] <Cork> A, a second :)
[06:40:25] <adac> right ;)
[06:40:34] <adac> sorry typo
[06:40:36] <adac> :P
[06:40:44] <Cork> adac: "data: { selected: $(this).find(':selected').text(), second: ''},"
[06:41:07] <Cork> or if you absolutly want to concat
[06:41:17] <Cork> its a normal param string so add an &
[06:41:26] <Cork> selected=&second&
[06:41:30] <Cork> * selected=&second=
[06:43:10] <pala> hi, i'm using a custom xhr (XDomainRequest so that IE8+ cross domain ajax requests work), but I have a problem that none of the events success/error/complete are called after the ajax request. The request is sent off and received a 200 response with the corect data from the server.
[06:43:31] <Xotix> Cork how do you have several IE's on the same machine?
[06:43:37] <Cork> pala: on ie8?
[06:43:45] <Cork> Xotix: kvm
[06:43:53] <Cork> ?g kvm
[06:43:53] <caniuse> Cork: Main Page - KVM - http://www.linux-kvm.org/
[06:43:54] <bot-t1> Cork, Main Page - KVM - http://www.linux-kvm.org/
[06:44:21] <pala> Cork, yes (here's the JS code I use to replace the XHR, maybe i am doing it wrong http://jsfiddle.net/2kh6E/)
[06:44:24] <g0rd0n> virtualbox.org
[06:44:41] <Xotix> Cork, ah you got linux right, but thanks! :)
[06:45:07] <eternicode> any indications when 1.7.2 will be out?  I don't see any open tickets under 1.7.2 and RC1 came out ~5 days ago, which seems like longer than usual between RC and final (if 1.7 and 1.7.1 are any indication).
[06:45:11] <Cork> Xotix: you :)
[06:45:27] <Cork> Xotix: got my self out of ms clutches many years ago :)
[06:45:32] <adac> Cork: thank you
[06:45:41] <Cork> yw
[06:45:52] <Xotix> g0rd0n VM of course but still, i don't like VMs.  I'm working on a mac… and we got a windows machine for testing etc. Thought, you got some nice hack to isntall several IEs but thanks anyway :=
[06:45:53] <Xotix> :)
[06:46:26] <Cork> Xotix: the best solution if you want to reduce the number of vms
[06:46:29] <Cork> is ietester
[06:46:44] <Martz_> can anyone tell me how i can fix the bug here? http://jsfiddle.net/4Bgx7/133/ i want the 2 colored divs within the first collapsable to be next to eachother dont dont bug true the button under it
[06:46:44] <Cork> it runs quite a lot of ie's in one installation
[06:46:50] <Cork> still needs windows though
[06:47:06] <pala> Cork, i updated the link with the ajax call as well  http://jsfiddle.net/2kh6E/1/
[06:49:45] <jeffkiesel> hi all, quick selector question
[06:49:47] * Cork wacks his client...
[06:50:10] <Cork> pala: to be honest this is the first time i've seen a solution like this
[06:50:21] <pala> Cork, what's the standard one?
[06:50:44] <Cork> pala: when i fiddled with it i just had a separat function i used as a wrapper
[06:50:44] <jeffkiesel> will this selector:  #table-comment tr.selected-comment:first   perform an exhaustive search of all tr elements?  or will it stop at the first instance of .selected-comment
[06:50:45] <jeffkiesel> ?
[06:50:52] <Cork> pala: its not a "standard one"
[06:51:04] <Cork> pala: just didn't know this was posible
[06:51:04] <jeffkiesel> i believe its exhaustive, but i wanted confirmation
[06:51:20] <Cork> pala: how are you solving the encoding problem btw?
[06:51:24] <Cork> (server side)
[06:51:36] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: The values of the drop-downs are strings in my drop-down menus
[06:51:39] <pala> Cork, what encoding problem are we talking about?
[06:51:54] <adac> Does somebody know how to return selectbox items (all not only the selected) via ajax?
[06:52:26] <Martz_> can i buy help from anyone here?
[06:52:45] <Cork> pala: the lack support for www-form-urlendoced
[06:53:01] <Cork> pala: thats why i dropped it completly
[06:54:20] <Cork> that basically means you can't post forms with XDomainRequest
[06:54:43] <pala> Cork, who said anything about forms, I'm trying to GET
[06:54:50] <Cork> heh
[06:54:51] <Cork> ok
[06:54:55] <M4d3L> hi. for jquery ui tabs, is it possible to ignore link (<a></a>) with no ID attribut?  actually, if I dont put id. it generate one and call link in ajax.
[06:55:35] <Cork> pala: as i said never tried it, but put some break points inside the ajax function and look at what happens
[06:55:49] <adac> So basically i would need to read out a selectbox and return all the values as an array
[06:55:55] <pala> Cork, I did, I can't figure it out
[06:56:00] <Cork> i'll prob do that when i get home, cause this is interesting :=
[06:56:12] <pala> Cork, how would you do cross domain requests in IE8+?
[06:56:22] <pala> Cork, I mean - did you see any other solutions?
[06:56:27] <Cork> pala: i'm doing it through a proxy
[06:56:54] <Cork> pala: for pure js jsonp or XDomainRequest is the only way
[06:57:25] <Cork> pala: and if you just want gets jsonp is prob the simplest way to get full cross browser support
[06:57:42] <pala> Cork, why would you do it through a proxy? doesn't that mean two requests instead of one?
[06:58:03] <Cork> the client access a special path on the same domain
[06:58:16] <Cork> that is nginx and forwards the request to the other server
[06:58:30] <Cork> so basically you don't do cross domain
[06:58:40] <Cork> (from how the browser sees it)
[06:58:41] <pala> Cork, i.e. 2 requests
[06:58:51] <Cork> not really twp
[06:59:07] <Cork> two would be the client first connecting to the proxy then connecting to the second domain
[06:59:18] <Cork> this is a normal front proxy solution
[06:59:28] <Cork> (proxy to second server is local lan)
[06:59:35] <ZosoosoZ> is this the right place to ask about making a customized dropdown?
[07:00:24] <pala> Cork, ok, sounds like one solution
[07:00:42] <Cork> its a bit sad, but ya currently its the best solution
[07:00:55] <Cork> i'm not happy loading scripts from third party
[07:02:03] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: http://pastie.org/3593255 is my code, my tables are both called class="matrix" however their valeues are text strings I  need to show table1 on load, then swap to a different table depending on drop-down
[07:02:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: sorry i gtg
[07:03:08] <Martz_> can anyone tell me how i can fix the bug here? http://jsfiddle.net/4Bgx7/133/ i want the 2 colored divs within the first collapsable to be next to eachother dont dont bug true the button under it
[07:04:16] <LukeNukem> any idea on how i can grab the title of something in an iframe?
[07:04:23] <kaputtmacher> hi there
[07:04:45] <nFFF> SamK1975, every get it working?
[07:04:58] <Brunoz> sup everyone
[07:04:58] <LukeNukem> nFFF, any idea mate?
[07:05:05] <LukeNukem> Brunoz, sup sup
[07:05:14] <kaputtmacher> how can i inspect the whole process of loading an iframe in fancy box step by step ?
[07:05:41] <SamK1975> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/b6DJQ/1/
[07:06:05] <SamK1975> oops hang on
[07:06:08] <recentlydeceased> hi folks, I have a checkbox that gets updated depending on the selection on a dropdown.  It works fine when I click a selection, but it will not update when I use the keyboard to go up or down the dropdown list.  any ideas how to get it to update?
[07:06:51] <recentlydeceased> the code to check the box is run by $('.dropdown').live('change', function() {}
[07:06:56] <kaputtmacher> recentlydeceased: you need to bind the change event on click & keyup
[07:06:56] <ZosoosoZ> call a keyup or keydown on it
[07:07:20] <recentlydeceased> ok, I'm a jquery noob
[07:07:24] <SamK1975> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/b6DJQ/3/
[07:07:38] <recentlydeceased> I take it that change funtion only covers click
[07:07:41] <kaputtmacher> this is mine jQuery('#country').bind('change keyup', toggleFormhandlerStateField );
[07:07:42] <SamK1975> its selecting the element with id="8"
[07:07:44] <fRAiLtY-> If I have 2 tables, and a drop-down box with 2 values in. I want to show table 1 on value 1 (hiding table 2) and table 2 on value 2, hiding table 1. Here's my code  but it just hides them both? http://pastie.org/3593255
[07:07:48] <SamK1975> which is exactly wrong
[07:08:26] <recentlydeceased> kaputtmacher, thanks I'll give it a go ;)
[07:08:32] <kaputtmacher> np
[07:08:38] <pala> Cork, can you point me to how you make the proxy in nginx? does it work for both GET and POST?
[07:08:50] <SamK1975> its supposed to select: 2,4,6
[07:09:55] <jeffkiesel> what is a faster selector td.comment:first or td#comment234  ?
[07:11:32] <recentlydeceased> kaputtmacher, is it possible to use change keyup keydown like this -> $('.dropdown')..live('change keyup keydown', function() {}
[07:12:15] <recentlydeceased> ah, no
[07:13:13] <kaputtmacher> recentlydeceased: btw: As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated.
[07:13:15] <Jon47> jeffkiesel: the ID selector will always be faster, but don't even include the "td" in that case
[07:13:36] <recentlydeceased> recentlydeceased, ah, ok, best get that updated, cheers
[07:13:40] <kaputtmacher> the documentation says…
[07:14:47] <jeffkiesel> Jon47: wouldnt they be the same?  they will both stop at the first instance of what they are looking for?  i agree with you though - i am looking for ammunition to settle a debate with a fellow dev
[07:14:48] <Jon47> recentlydeceased: you can def bind events to multiple handlers that way (using .on preferably) but you need to be aware of when each of those events fire, and write the handler function appropriately
[07:15:16] <rhodesjason> Hey everyone -- is there a better way to handle a fade animation than using "fadeIn()" and absolute positioning? i can't get that to feel as smooth as i want it ...
[07:15:34] <LukeNukem> how can i grab the title of a page in iframe?
[07:15:35] <LukeNukem> ^.^
[07:15:53] <LukeNukem> i did this var title = $('.iframe_query_pass').contents().find("title").text();
[07:16:00] <Jon47> jeffkiesel: they might both find the same element, but the id selector will be a lot faster, though it probably won't be noticable unless your DOM is ridiculously huge
[07:16:01] <LukeNukem> when i alert it, all i get is a whitespace
[07:16:03] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem: is the iframe on the same domain?
[07:16:24] <LukeNukem> johnkpaul, yes
[07:16:31] <jeffkiesel> thanks Jon47
[07:16:49] <Jon47> jeffkiesel: it depends on what you're doing, if the intent of the code is to find the first comment td, the first example seems like it matches that intent better
[07:16:54] <SamK1975> nFFF, Cork: ok guys, this is as far as I have got.. my version and cork's in jsfiddle
[07:17:02] <Jon47> btu in that case you should do $('td.comment').find(':first')
[07:17:13] <SamK1975> mine works, but only if I dont have class="B" on div 1
[07:17:17] <SamK1975> (which I need)
[07:17:20] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem: try .get(0).contentWindow.document.getElementsByTagName("title")[0].innerHTMl
[07:17:53] <LukeNukem> this fine?
[07:17:53] <LukeNukem> var title = .get(0).contentWindow.document.getElementsByTagName("title")[0].innerHTMl;
[07:18:00] <Jon47> jeffkiesel: read the Additional Notes on :first here: http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[07:18:13] <LukeNukem> wait
[07:18:14] <LukeNukem> this
[07:18:14] <LukeNukem> $.get(0).contentWindow.document.getElementsByTagName("title")[0].innerHTMl;

[07:21:16] <LukeNukem> i have jquery on it, reading the content of the webpage
[07:21:26] <LukeNukem> using $("body").text();
[07:21:37] <LukeNukem> then i alert it, but then it returns all the javascript in the page too
[07:21:43] <LukeNukem> how can i exclude the javascript
[07:22:02] <SamK1975> ok, this seems to work: $('root').find('.A:not(.B .B .A)')
[07:22:05] <Tram> @Zogot, that was not what i meant, but this is even better, thanks!1!!!111111111111111111
[07:22:49] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem: this is a completely different problem than before
[07:22:53] <johnkpaul> you have jQuery on your server?
[07:22:56] <johnkpaul> in your php?
[07:23:13] <Xotix> is there something like unit tests for jQuery (js)? When does it make sense start using them?
[07:23:26] <LukeNukem> johnkpaul, the php downloads html off another server into my server
[07:23:30] <LukeNukem> and that html is rendered in a file
[07:23:38] <LukeNukem> i will use jquery to get the title of the rendered html
[07:23:56] <LukeNukem> and the content of it too, using $('body').text(); but it returns all the javascript too, i dont want the javascript
[07:24:04] <LukeNukem> it returns all the js code in the web page too
[07:24:28] <Know1edge> How can you make your plugin "bind" to new elements that are dynamically created — currently it binds with this.each from the passed selector, but its only for elements that exist in the dom at runtime
[07:24:56] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem: the easiest way that I can think of is to use the DOM on the php side to remove all script elements
[07:24:59] <NoiseEee> Know1edge: use 'on()' on a parent element / event delegation
[07:25:10] <Jon47> recentlydeceased: I can't do it for ya but here's a fiddle so you can get started http://jsfiddle.net/LKnvG/
[07:25:11] <johnkpaul> and then write the serialization to the html page
[07:25:20] <dmsuperman> What's the smartest way to attach arbitrary events to objects without using the dom? So that I can come back and call .trigger on them later
[07:25:23] <dmsuperman> but they don't happen to a node
[07:25:46] <johnkpaul> dmsuperman: you can use the regular jQuery.Event for that
[07:25:53] <Know1edge> NoiseEee: I know about attaching events to new elements with on, trying to make it so my plugin call matches on any new elements matching the original selector too
[07:25:53] <LukeNukem> johnkpaul, but then i cant grab the bodys content with jquery
[07:25:53] <dmsuperman> could I do something where jquery wraps around an object?
[07:25:56] <LukeNukem> -_-
[07:25:59] <johnkpaul> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-custom-events-they-will-rock-your-world/ @dmsuperman
[07:26:11] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem:  why not?
[07:26:16] <johnkpaul> you're removing the script tags
[07:26:42] <NoiseEee> Know1edge: $('#parentElementID').on('click','.classOfElementsICareAboutFutureOrPresent',function() { //yeah });
[07:26:45] <LukeNukem> johnkpaul, well my jquery code is inside <script> tags o.o
[07:27:18] <dmsuperman> johnkpaul: I don't want to use the dom as I said
[07:27:32] <dmsuperman> Which this page seems to only refer to
[07:28:06] <johnkpaul> :/ sorry dmsuperman, this is the article I intended to send
[07:28:06] <johnkpaul> http://weblog.bocoup.com/publishsubscribe-with-jquery-custom-events/
[07:28:12] <johnkpaul> I need a better way to manage bookmarks
[07:28:27] <LukeNukem> johnkpaul, dude any solutions for me
[07:31:00] <dmsuperman> johnkpaul: wouldn't binding to the document still incur some extra overhead though?
[07:31:06] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem: there are many solutions, you just have to pick one
[07:31:37] <johnkpaul> dmsuperman: it's definitely not performant
[07:31:53] <johnkpaul> I thought you wanted to use the same pattern that you use elsewhere
[07:32:08] <johnkpaul> if you don't care about doing it using the jQuery mechanism, a real pubsub lib will be much faster
[07:32:24] <dmsuperman> I do I was just hoping jquery might magically do some fancy wrapping around non-dom stuff. I only want to use jquery code because it's what we already use everywhere else
[07:32:28] <dmsuperman> for maintainability
[07:34:05] <stefan2> Can anyone suggest a solution to this: I have a loop that makes jsonp .getJSON requests with an append for the returning data. The problem is that which ever gets back first gets appened first. So they are sometimes out of order. Since I make josnp requests I can't do synchronos via .ajax. Any suggestions how I keep the data in order?
[07:35:21] <johnkpaul> dmsuperman: so jQuery doesn't have it's own pubsub that you can use separte from the dom completely
[07:35:41] <johnkpaul> but, using the document, you can use the same abstraction for regular objects
[07:35:57] <johnkpaul> for maintainability, realy depends on your developers
[07:36:12] <johnkpaul> $.subscribe and $.publish aren't that different than $().on and $().trigger
[07:36:21] <dmsuperman> I guess it's not that huge a deal to just attach to the document
[07:36:21] <johnkpaul> in terms of complexity and learning curve
[07:36:31] <johnkpaul> dmsuperman: it is in terms of performance
[07:36:38] <johnkpaul> read that whole artcile
[07:36:54] <johnkpaul> I mean, I don't think it'd matter in most of the use cases I'd come up with
[07:37:08] <johnkpaul> but in case you really need to know that your code is as fast as possible, perhaps it's not a good idea
[07:37:15] <dmsuperman> it would matter if I were writing node code but then I wouldn't be using jquery
[07:37:22] <dmsuperman> on a page the events called will be pretty limited
[07:37:31] <dmsuperman> once per ajax response
[07:37:35] <johnkpaul> if you're going to switch between node and browser, then just use a regular pubsub library
[07:37:45] <johnkpaul> the overhead of the extra 3k is worth it
[07:37:47] <johnkpaul> IMHO
[07:37:57] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem: have you tried using text()?
[07:38:03] <dmsuperman> well basically I have a defined interface/api between the two
[07:38:09] <dmsuperman> and each side just implements it differently
[07:38:17] <dmsuperman> frontend has its own "ok" and "error" events and backend has its own
[07:38:17] <LukeNukem> johnkpaul, ye
[07:38:26] <dmsuperman> so I don't have to share that particular code
[07:38:47] <johnkpaul> if the frontend events aren't necessarily bound to particular dom objects either, it might be better to use a regular pub sub library there too
[07:40:00] <dmsuperman> well right in theory that's the way I'd do it from the start but in practice we're already using jquery trigger everywhere
[07:40:09] <stefan2> Another question: .html() will parse any javascript in <script> tags but not jquery. Anyway to use the already loaded jquery without having to load it again?
[07:41:17] <johnkpaul> stefan2: .html() doesn't do any parseing AFAIK, what do you mean
[07:43:05] <johnkpaul> dmsuperman: I think it would be pretty cool if you could extend jquery's on and trigger to call another libraries publish and subscribe in certain cases
[07:43:35] <dmsuperman> I don't know much about extending jquery, is it possible to override the trigger prototype code and then have that call the original?
[07:43:43] <dmsuperman> I'd want it to behave otherwise exactly the same
[07:43:44] <stefan2> johnkpaul, when I give .html some html with script tags in it, it will eval that javascript.
[07:44:07] <stefan2> johnkpaul, it doesn't do that when I use innerHtml.
[07:44:19] <johnkpaul> ooh I see
[07:44:27] <johnkpaul> that javascript should be running in the global scope, I'd assume
[07:44:34] <stefan2> johnkpaul, but jquery tags dont work
[07:44:48] <johnkpaul> what's a jquery tag?
[07:44:57] <stefan2> johnkpaul, what I can do it place jquery in the meta tag and load it again.
[07:45:17] <stefan2> johnkpaul, by tag I mean any jquery
[07:45:40] <stefan2> johnkpaul, like $("#test"). etc
[07:46:19] <stefan2> johnkpaul, I guess what is in the html tag is a new scope but Im not sure if I can access the global one
[07:47:35] <khinester> hello, how do you add icons to dialog buttons, this example does not seem to work http://davidjquery.com/jquery-ui-1/demos/dialog/buttons.html with jquery 1.7 and ui 1.8
[07:49:15] <recentlydeceased> Jon47, thanks, spent some time on it (that jsfiddle site is pretty darn useful!)... on the scale of things it's not a massive priority so I'll leave it for now!
[07:49:59] <johnkpaul> dmsuperman: you could do it without any specific knowledge of jQuery, just know that jQuery.prototype.trigger and jQuery.prototype.on is what you need to extend
[07:50:05] <deni> hi there.....can anyone help me with a problem i have with jquery markitup?
[07:50:23] <johnkpaul> stefan2: I don't actually know, can you make a jsfiddle to show what is going on
[07:50:31] <deni> i wish to be able to send the markdown content to a remote link via a post request....
[07:51:01] <deni> now the server is set up and works fine...but the jquery markitup plugin is giving me a hard time trying to get it to work
[07:51:19] <dmsuperman> johnkpaul: ah gotchya, sweet
[07:51:37] <deni> the way i undestand it this should be possible and quite easily done so i'm missing something trivial i'd guess
[07:52:05] <deni> i'm not suer to what ti set the previewParser variable
[07:52:32] <methoddk> is there a good resource for understanding how data passes from view to view? i want to search and pass the data to another view, I did the tutorial but I'm not understanding
[07:52:37] <deni> there is a renderPreview function somwhere down below but i can't just call it
[07:52:45] <deni> anyone?
[07:52:58] <johnkpaul> stefan2: actually, the script tag is removed, so nothing should execute, maybe you should use
[07:53:00] <johnkpaul> ?getScript
[07:53:01] <bot-t1> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[07:53:20] <stefan2> mmm, I'll take a look, thanks
[07:55:02] <johnkpaul> deni: it's hard to tell because we don't know that plugin very well, can you describe the particular problem you're having
[07:55:13] <johnkpaul> methoddk: what do you mean "view to view"?
[07:55:20] <johnkpaul> are you using javascriptMVC or something?
[07:55:22] <methoddk> oh, wrong channel
[07:55:28] <methoddk> that was meant for django
[07:55:47] <deni> johnkpaul: well i don't understand it as well.....
[07:55:54] <deni> i was hoping to run into someone who uses it here
[07:55:59] <hiryu> hello
[07:56:30] <johnkpaul> methoddk: :D
[08:05:04] <xrated> There's nothing intrinsically wrong with passing html inside of json, is there? It's just a string so far as the data structure is concerned.
[08:05:06] <xrated> Right?
[08:05:56] <NoiseEee> xrated: pretty sure its A-OK as long as you're not opening any holes / spitting back bad/xss'd html for example
[08:07:06] <xec> xrated: sure, as long as the json is still valid, like escape quotes etc
[08:07:50] <kindness> hi all, I'm trying to determine if an elements exists using jQuery by using if ($(selector).length > 0) { // do something }}. However, when the object does not exist, my code stops instead of just continuing with a failed if statement. Anyone know why this wouldn't work?
[08:08:54] <xec> kindness: maybe a syntax error? any errors in console? does jslint say anything?
[08:09:44] <xec> i see an extra } but i'm guessing it's just a typo in your question
[08:10:07] <kindness> oh yeah, it's a typo i made while chatting
[08:10:18] <kindness> jslint isn't picking anything up...
[08:11:28] <kindness> it should be pretty straightforward. I can't think of anything that would break it
[08:11:52] <kindness> I was hoping someone in here had run into this before and would be like, oh yeah, there's a global var somewhere messing with you or something
[08:13:21] <xec> kindness: without more info i can make some wild guesses, but that's just what they will be - wild guesses ;)
[08:13:59] <xec> can you reproduce the error in a fiddle?
[08:14:05] <[1]Bram> hi guys, I want to create a simple delegate for a print button, but can't get it to work.. see http://jsfiddle.net/uSFrh/
[08:14:06] <kindness> xec: yeah. honestly, that's kinda what I'm looking for. I can put together a fiddle, but it probably still won't be immediately clear what I'm doing.
[08:14:52] <kindness> xec: I know that's not very helpful. Sorry for my lack of specificity. I've been mired in this code for a while. Let me see if I can break it out into a fiddle
[08:14:53] <[1]Bram> hmm if I get rid of the domready wrapper it's working.. nevermind
[08:15:32] <xec> kindness: does the console say anything at all? maybe try to console.log() the if condition and see what you get
[08:15:32] <kindness> xec: ah, no, 'cause i'm using jQuery UI multiselect
[08:16:10] <kindness> xec: tried that. I can't even get the program to admit that $(selector).length is undefinied. literally nothing happens when I run this section of code. very weird,
[08:16:46] <xec> kindness: if the code isnt run at all it must be something earlier failing
[08:17:38] <kindness> xec: okay. possible. let me throw some console.logs in before hand
[08:20:38] <rained23> hi, how can I make a form that inside of it have a more than 1 file upload that is asynchronous ? I want to use jQuery form to make it happen, but as I know I cant have a sub form.
[08:21:26] <nealstewart> hey guys. i'm looking for reusing the selector parsing from sizzle. anyone willing to point me in the right direction?
[08:22:10] <johnkpaul> nealstewart: http://sizzlejs.com/
[08:22:15] <johnkpaul> it's a completely separate project I think
[08:22:30] <nealstewart> i want to take a selector and introspect on it.
[08:22:37] <Woet> nealstewart: and why are you asking jquery?
[08:22:53] <nealstewart> sizzle is a separate project that's only used for jquery.
[08:22:55] <nealstewart> ;P
[08:23:12] <Woet> nealstewart: only used for jquery? the features I see on their site are supported by jquery itself
[08:23:12] <nealstewart> is there a room for it?
[08:24:01] <nealstewart> sizzle is jquery's selector engine.
[08:24:07] <Woet> oh i see
[08:24:16] <nealstewart> :)
[08:24:16] <Woet> only thing i can find is http://groups.google.com/group/sizzlejs
[08:24:20] <johnkpaul> completely separate in that it has no interdependencies
[08:24:21] <Woet> last post 2010
[08:24:21] <nealstewart> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle
[08:24:34] <johnkpaul> jquery depends on sizzle, never the other way around
[08:25:05] <ShawnRisk> hi rroelofs
[08:29:05] <rained23> Ok, I know that I can't nest a form, so I think I can do it by removing a fields from a form during submit, can I do it using jQuery ? or I means submitting only selected fields that I set.
[08:29:09] <rethus> how can i check, if a element is toggeld?
[08:29:15] <rethus> means activated?
[08:29:30] <rained23> Can I remove or submit only selected fields ?
[08:30:10] <rethus> how can i check, if class has "activated" inside of it, even if there are more than one class-definition on it (like class=" asdf test activated" ?
[08:30:14] <rained23> Plus it's a file fields that I want to remove or submit
[08:33:10] <ShawnRisk> how do I call js files to my ajax window like a lightbox?
[08:35:57] <daslicht> i i like to animate the opacity and width of a div expanding from right to left. any suggestions how to do this ?
[08:36:09] <daslicht> from left to right it is no problem
[08:36:49] <daslicht> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide#overview this woul;d be nice but there is no way to animatethe opacity ?
[08:37:06] <rained23> Seems like I need flash to solve this problems..
[08:37:10] <rained23> :(
[08:37:16] <daslicht> :)
[08:37:35] <rained23> Just hoped that my page clean from flash.
[08:38:13] <GoGoGarrett> I'm trying to use Jquery UI to do sortable, but I'm trying to do the update on a button click, but I can't seem to get it working

[08:39:14] <retrostyle|13> Hey ho :)
[08:39:38] <retrostyle|13> Anyone know best html5 and css3 editor?
[08:39:39] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone i have this piece of javascript code i would like to change so it would run on page completion
[08:39:53] <jarr0dsz> i tried some things but really not jquery hero anyone might want to take a peek? http://pastie.org/3594259
[08:39:56] <jarr0dsz> its like 5 lines total
[08:40:17] <Mage_Dude> jarr0dsz: Look at the document ready() calls
[08:40:24] <jarr0dsz> if i remove that !active ? would that do to make it autoload?
[08:40:30] <Zzaichik> html5 editor?
[08:41:03] <daslicht> are there any yet
[08:41:18] <daslicht> most seam to be still in stoneage compared to other languages
[08:41:35] <daslicht> :)
[08:41:36] <LucaS05> hi
[08:41:44] <LucaS05> i've a situation like this <div id="coldx">
[08:41:44] <LucaS05>     <div id="slideshow">
[08:41:44] <LucaS05>         <img src="image1.jpg" />
[08:41:44] <LucaS05>         <img src="image2.jpg" />
[08:41:44] <LucaS05>         <img src="image3.jpg" />
[08:41:44] <LucaS05>     </div>
[08:41:45] <jarr0dsz> would something like in the 2nd block do? http://jsfiddle.net/4anFR/
[08:41:49] <LucaS05> sorry
[08:41:57] <jarr0dsz> hi LucaS05 better use pastie.org or jsfiddle.org for pasting ;p
[08:42:09] <rethus> is there a way to use a command for more than one elements...
[08:42:09] <rethus> like: $('#headBox_div1' + '#headBox_div2' + '#headBox_div3').toggle(); ?
[08:42:13] <Zzaichik> my eyes! :p
[08:42:17] <Mage_Dude> jarr0dsz: http://bit.ly/wwGbqU
[08:42:24] <rethus> thats only pseudo-code ;)
[08:42:47] <Jon47> rethus, separate them with a comma, all in one string, just like CSS
[08:42:48] <LucaS05> i know sorry
[08:42:49] <daslicht> for more than one elements...: use a class
[08:42:50] <LucaS05> :D
[08:42:56] <jarr0dsz> Mage_Dude: like so http://jsfiddle.net/4anFR/1/
[08:43:02] <daslicht> not #headBox_div1' + '#headBox_div2' + '#headBox_div3
[08:43:18] <daslicht> just use ".yourClassName"
[08:43:21] <rethus> Jon47: this way: $('#headBox_btn1','#headBox_btn2','#headBox_btn3').toggle();
[08:43:26] <Jon47> all in one string
[08:43:31] <Jon47> but daslicht is right, assign a class to them
[08:43:40] <Zzaichik> ?jsfiddle
[08:43:40] <Mage_Dude> jarr0dsz: Kinda... but you have it set for Mootools not jquery, but yes pretty close
[08:43:49] <warrenparsons> rethus: No. Like this $('.oneClassAssignedToAllMyElements').toggle();
[08:43:59] <rethus> how cani use a class?
[08:44:13] <rethus> ah a css-class you mena.
[08:44:15] <rethus> thanks
[08:44:23] <daslicht> <div class="yourclass">
[08:44:27] <LucaS05> anyway i've a situation like this http://jsfiddle.net/8Hw7v/ but the content of coldx is dynamic so the slideshow goes away then comes back. i use the cicly plugin how can i set the slideshow to slide everytime it appears in the coldx div?
[08:44:42] <daslicht> <div class="oneClassAssignedToAllMyElements">
[08:44:43] <daslicht> :)
[08:45:13] <ShawnRisk> how do I call js files to my ajax window like a lightbox?
[08:45:16] <warrenparsons> daslicht: I prefer clarity over brevity :p
[08:45:38] <daslicht> just to lazy at the moment :)
[08:45:45] <daslicht> just ate a lot of things
[08:45:47] <daslicht> phhh
[08:45:53] <daslicht> cant even sit straight
[08:45:55] <daslicht> lol
[08:47:15] <GoGoGarrett> https://gist.github.com/03ecf48f3ad1f58e9d7f  any idea why this won't update when clicking a.selector
[08:47:52] <warrenparsons> GoGoGarrett: Because you're not binding a click event anywhere… ?
[08:48:08] <GoGoGarrett> https://gist.github.com/03ecf48f3ad1f58e9d7f/f9732573937a99ce07217e657d8cd018b6d17114
[08:48:11] <GoGoGarrett> I tried this origionallity
[08:48:13] <GoGoGarrett> but that wasn't woring either
[08:48:52] <_dave_h_d> hi all, is there any way to get the .focus to work on mobile safari so it focuses into a text field and pops-up the keyboard?
[08:50:04] <Gorkyman> hey guys.. I need to calculate the width of two link boxes to match left and right background of the page... like it is done in here: www.zavvi.com
[08:50:08] <Gorkyman> any suggestion?
[08:50:18] <jarr0dsz> hmm frustrating although code looks good it just won't work :(
[08:50:25] <daslicht> how would you animate a divs opacity from 0 to 1 and its width/height from 0 0  to 100 100 but from right to left ?
[08:50:45] <Zzaichik> Gorkyman: .outerWidth()?   (without looking at it..)
[08:50:46] <daslicht> is there a way to set the origin when using animate ?
[08:51:24] <johnkpaul> daslicht: animate isn't using a flash-like tween, it's actually just changing the css
[08:51:34] <daslicht> i know
[08:51:35] <johnkpaul> so structure your element in such a way that you can animate the property and have that happen
[08:51:39] <Gorkyman> Zzaichik: no, two <a links are created with absolute position to the top left and top right... then the width is calculated on the fly...
[08:51:46] <daslicht> i hoped there is a built in solution
[08:51:51] <johnkpaul> no, there isn't
[08:51:55] <daslicht> so i have to move it to archive this ?
[08:51:57] <GoGoGarrett> warrenparsons: any idea why it wouldn't work if it's within a click(function()
[08:52:03] <recentlydeceased> really simple question here, but I want to copy  what $('.foo').val()  returns into $('.bar')... what's the best method?
[08:52:04] <Zzaichik> …maybe I'll look at your example then
[08:52:04] <johnkpaul> not in jQuery, perhaps some other library
[08:52:12] <LucaS05> can somebody help me?
[08:52:21] <johnkpaul> daslicht: it depends
[08:52:28] <daslicht> on?
[08:52:32] <Gorkyman> Zzaichik: so if I change the browser width the width of those link boxes also gets recalculated..
[08:52:34] <johnkpaul> if the element was floated right, and flush against the side of it's container, then it would work like you describe
[08:52:37] <jgarbers1> When building table rows with jQuery, most tips I've seen suggest building the HTML up as a string to avoid the overhead of lots of .append calls.  However, if your textual data might have & and < and > in it, you'd still need to escape it, right? How best to do that?
[08:52:46] <daslicht> ok its absolut
[08:52:47] <ShawnRisk> how do I call js files to my ajax window like a lightbox?
[08:52:49] <daslicht> :/
[08:53:01] <daslicht> but great idea
[08:53:06] <johnkpaul> if it's absolute, you'll have to animate the left at the same time as the width :/
[08:53:09] <daslicht> i try to fiddel something
[08:53:16] <johnkpaul> cool, have fun daslicht
[08:53:21] <daslicht> yeah !
[08:53:23] <daslicht> thanks
[08:54:08] <jarr0dsz> is there some other jquery code to get a elements property?
[08:54:13] <jarr0dsz> i believe http://jsfiddle.net/4anFR/3/ is just javascript code
[08:54:21] <jarr0dsz> if i place an alert before it works after it works not
[08:54:48] <Zzaichik> Gorkyman: okay so in your example, what link boxes are we talking about?
[08:55:12] <Gorkyman> Zzaichik: if you open that link... you see the background "banners" on the left and on the right of the page
[08:55:18] <Gorkyman> that are clickable
[08:55:50] <Gorkyman> Zzaichik: looking at the source code those are two <a> links
[08:55:58] <Gandalf84> hi
[08:56:13] <Gandalf84> can I get the REAL dimension of an image ?
[08:56:25] <superdmp> I'm looking for a ticker - except it's not quite a ticker, it's more like the twitter feed thing on https://www.django-cms.org/ - what do you call that?
[08:56:27] <Gandalf84> I need the real width and height
[08:56:49] <superdmp> at least if I know what these things are called I can do a search for one!
[08:57:21] <superdmp> why anyone would want an actual ticker is beyond me
[09:00:40] <nFFF> Gorkyman, you can set the dimensions of the two links, using the height and width of the images theyre positioed over?
[09:02:09] <ShawnRisk> how do I call js files to my ajax window like a lightbox?
[09:02:42] <Gorkyman> nFFF: uhm no... if screen width is lets say 1000px then left box should be like 100px
[09:03:39] <Gorkyman> and if you change the size width should be calculated to (screensize-800px(lets say thats the fixed middle wrapper width))/2
[09:05:23] <jonclark> superdmp: i think the "cycle" plugin will accomplish what you're looking for. http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/
[09:06:55] <superdmp> thanks jonclark  - I think http://www.jquerynewsticker.com/ will do for me, as I can turn off some of the irritating ticking
[09:07:49] <nFFF> Gorkyman are you wanting this to work on screen resize, or just to work on different mointor sizes?
[09:07:51] <jonclark> fair enough, good luck! :)
[09:08:14] <Gorkyman> nFFF: both
[09:08:17] <Francisc> I have a cached collection of <li> elements in $lis. How can I get the 13th one for example? I tried $lis.find('eq(13)') and $lis.find('nth-child(13)') but both select all <li> elements. What am I doing wrong, please?
[09:08:23] <nFFF> Well the resize should be easy
[09:08:26] <nFFF> ?resize
[09:08:27] <bot-t> .resize(handler): Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[09:09:28] <daslicht> great sliding stuff: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/02/slide-elements-in-different-directions
[09:09:33] <nFFF> you could use $(window).width() and height() to update yur link css
[09:09:54] <Gorkyman> hm, sounds right
[09:10:56] <Mage_Dude> Why did they have to replace .live() with a horrid .on() for event handling!? <screams to the heavens>
[09:11:54] <nFFF> $(window).resize(function(){ var h = $(window).height(), w = $(window).width(); $('a .yourlink').css({'height':h, 'width':w;}); });
[09:12:11] <nFFF> something like that might work
[09:12:42] <FinalAngel> can anyone recommend a plugin that adds mobile touch events to jquery?
[09:12:51] <Gorkyman> nFFF: thanks, I'll try
[09:13:55] <coachz> hi, what's the best way to test if my javascript variable is null or empty string please ?
[09:14:17] <nFFF> Gorkyman, there's an extra ';' after 'w' in the object passed into the css() method, you might want to delete :>
[09:15:02] <swook> Is there anyone here who knows YQL and ODTs? I'm in dire need of help!
[09:15:53] <coachz> do i use .val() ?
[09:16:38] <phil-adept> coachz: Depends on what the var is
[09:16:49] <coachz> string
[09:17:00] <coachz> i'm trying to test for null or empty string
[09:17:54] <phil-adept> coachz: you can use typeof()
[09:18:18] <coachz> typeof says it's a string, how do i test for null or empty string values though
[09:18:45] <phil-adept> coachz: sorry, you can use typeof to make sure it is a string then check != ''.
[09:18:54] <phil-adept> If it's null it will fail the typeof
[09:19:08] <coachz> thanks
[09:19:14] <coachz> i'll try that now
[09:20:26] <coachz> 	if(rmsg !== '')   didn't work
[09:20:58] <coachz> alert(rmsg);   shows nothing,  alert(typeof(rmsg));  shows string
[09:21:38] <coachz> but   if(rmsg !== '') { alter("hi"); }     alerts hi
[09:21:53] <coachz> s/alter/alert
[09:23:03] <phil-adept> try != instead of !==
[09:23:07] <jarr0dsz> tried figuring this out myself ihave so far: http://pastie.org/private/pbnrv6ftgjgmnjwmg4z2tq
[09:23:19] <jarr0dsz> anyone can help me get this to work? im out of options the before alert works the after alert not
[09:23:24] <coachz> no change
[09:23:42] <jarr0dsz> i need to find a flash movie in the page and then get  its id, could i perhaps alert the id somehow to check if it works partly?
[09:23:42] <coachz> 	if(rmsg != ''){ 		alert("hi"); 			}
[09:23:49] <phil-adept> coachz you have some sample code to show?
[09:24:01] <coachz> that's it
[09:24:17] <coachz> alert(typeof(rmsg));   returns string
[09:25:03] <phil-adept> jarr0dsz, can't you use $('#stream1').attr("src", "rtmp://streamserver/myapp?play=live");
[09:25:14] <phil-adept> since you're already uing jquery
[09:25:43] <coachz> i love simple things that are silly hard
[09:25:46] <jarr0dsz> phil-adept: im not sure maybe i got this from blogs and the jquery docs
[09:25:59] <jarr0dsz> i try phil-adept but it doesent even get the swf id
[09:26:10] <jarr0dsz> from stackoverflow i read that swfobject.getObjectById should be correct but it aint working
[09:26:18] <phil-adept> coachz: that example doesn't tell me how rmsg is defined?
[09:26:42] <phil-adept> jarr0dsz: what ID is it given in the DOM in firebug?
[09:26:49] <Mage_Dude> Can anyone describe how to setup Firebug to watch a jquery statement to see why a .on() call isn't working on a real page even though it works on jsfiddle?
[09:26:56] <jarr0dsz> phil-adept: not sure let me check the ID for the swf you mean?
[09:26:56] <coachz> var rmsg = '';
[09:27:23] <phil-adept> jarr0dsz: yeah
[09:27:31] <jarr0dsz> phil-adept: theres a lot of info under the dom not sure exactly hwere to look at
[09:28:33] <phil-adept> jarr0dsz: you're trying to grasb the element 'stream1' aren't you? Is there anything in the dom / markup in FB that has the ID 'stream1'
[09:28:53] <jarr0dsz> phil-adept: yes ah i get you im searching for it
[09:29:09] <jarr0dsz> seems to be non existant
[09:29:23] <jarr0dsz> i have id="stream1" inside the swf html code though
[09:30:19] <phil-adept> then if the swf has the id stream1 you should be able to grab it using regular jquery selectors
[09:31:32] <jarr0dsz> phil-adept: <object id="stream1" etc
[09:31:44] <jarr0dsz> but when i search in FB in dom tab i dont find anything on stream1 strange
[09:31:47] <coachz> rmsg is then assigned the value of an ajax call with   " rmsg = retVal;"
[09:31:57] <coachz> but the test shows it to be type string
[09:31:58] <jarr0dsz> could it be cause i load the page with ajax inside another page?
[09:32:35] <coachz> if i assign   rmsg = '';  the  			if(rmsg != ''){ alert("notempty"); }   works
[09:32:53] <coachz> but the retval is assigning something funky to the var rmsg
[09:33:10] <coachz> it says it's typeof  string,  could it be null ?
[09:37:10] <phil-adept> coachz:....
[09:37:13] <phil-adept> http://jsfiddle.net/q8kYr/
[09:38:28] <jarr0dsz> hmmz phil-adept i just checked when i dont use ajax calls and it also won't work any idea what might cause the issue? im really out of options
[09:39:28] <phil-adept> I don't exactly know what it is you're trying to attempt jarr0dsz? What are you trying to actually achieve?
[09:40:01] <jarr0dsz> phil-adept: like   swfobject.getObjectById("stream1").setProperty("src", "rtmp://streamserver/myapp?play=live"); i want to set a property on loading the page for an swf videoplayer thingy
[09:40:11] <jarr0dsz> so it will load the rtmp video feed in on loading of the page
[09:40:58] <phil-adept> have you got any example code? jsfiddle?
[09:41:49] <jarr0dsz> phil-adept: yes but its hard since i cannot include an .swf file
[09:42:49] <ShawnRisk> how do I call js files within a colorbox window? I am calling an external div from another page, and I need to render js into this content so that the content is useable.
[09:43:16] <jarr0dsz> phil-adept: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/4anFR/6/
[09:43:39] <jarr0dsz> this one sorry http://jsfiddle.net/4anFR/7/
[09:44:10] <jarr0dsz> arghh http://jsfiddle.net/4anFR/8/ forgot the JS
[09:55:27] <daslicht> @johnkpaul: thnks again , I found a solution !,
[09:55:58] <johnkpaul> no problem!
[09:56:00] <johnkpaul> what was the oslution
[09:56:32] <dangerousdave> Hello, If i have <option value="1" data-currecy-code="XXX">Andorra</option> in my select, how do I extract the data-currecy-code please?
[09:57:04] <dangerousdave> var text = $(this).attr('data-currecy-code'); didnt work
[10:01:17] <sterlo> is $() just shorthand for $(this)?
[10:01:34] <xec> nope
[10:01:41] <sterlo> xec: what is it then?
[10:02:00] <sterlo> xec: is it referencing the jquery object as a whole?
[10:02:20] <xec> no, it's executing the jquery function without arguments :)
[10:02:29] <sterlo> xec: ah...hodor
[10:02:33] <sterlo> xec: lol thanks
[10:08:22] <robkinyon> I have a tooltip that i'm using to contain a form
[10:08:28] <robkinyon> the form has two select elements and a submit button
[10:08:44] <robkinyon> whenever i do a mousedown over the select elements, the tooltip closes
[10:08:47] <robkinyon> why?
[10:09:12] <daslicht> if I try this code localhost it is not working properly on IE9: http://jsfiddle.net/KscAa/1/
[10:09:23] <daslicht> on JSfiddle however it is working with IE9 ?
[10:09:30] <daslicht> any idea why?
[10:10:08] <rhodesjason> anyone have recommendations for how to make repeating fade events run smoothly?
[10:10:27] <rhodesjason> even a recursive setTimeout loop seems to have a lot of problems with getting a bit janky
[10:11:46] <ShawnRisk> how do I call js files within a colorbox window? I am calling an external div from another page, and I need to render js into this content so that the content is useable.
[10:12:43] <ShawnRisk> seems no one wants to touch my question
[10:13:01] <ShawnRisk> daslicht: not sure on the question
[10:13:15] <daslicht> me neither
[10:13:28] <daslicht> maybe my local jqueryUI is teh fault
[10:13:31] <daslicht> i try to update
[10:13:54] <fris> ShawnRisk script tags in the div maybe?
[10:14:05] <ShawnRisk> daslicht: right get same versions
[10:14:43] <ShawnRisk> fris: yes but I have so many pages so loading them in a div on one page will not help
[10:15:05] <CoolCoder> Is there any way to get the coordinates(top and left of a div A) which is on top of another div B with respect to div B
[10:16:09] <ShawnRisk> fris: if I was able to load the head tags that might work.  two of the three js files I need re loaded onto both pages.
[10:16:12] <daslicht> strange , same buggy result
[10:16:13] <daslicht> lol
[10:16:26] <daslicht> i try uploading an example ion a webserver and try it there
[10:17:52] <ShawnRisk> fris: do you want to see the page, I can pm you the link
[10:19:31] <daslicht> Anyone like to try thsi please :http://ansolas.de/dev/js/jQueryToggleAnimate/test.html
[10:19:39] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: you're the one doing that jquery meetup tomorrow?
[10:19:41] <daslicht> try with Firefox and compare to IE9
[10:19:41] <ajpiano> legit!
[10:19:42] <daslicht> :)
[10:19:51] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: :D yes, are you in NYC?
[10:19:59] <johnkpaul> I'm actually preparing slides right now
[10:20:04] <ajpiano> yeah man
[10:20:31] <johnkpaul> cool
[10:20:42] <ajpiano> i might be able to make it out, hmm
[10:20:43] <daslicht> does the IE interpret marginLeft and top somehow different than FireFox ?
[10:23:37] <daslicht> ahh ok it is only wokring in IE9 Model , all other modes will not work properly
[10:23:54] <daslicht> so next question is , how to force the IE9 to run in IE9 Mode
[10:24:01] <Whirl3d> can I clone the jquery object itself, then modify the selector method on the clone and then use the collections interchangeably?
[10:26:17] <daslicht> any suggestions or expericnce how to handle this properly ?
[10:26:31] <phil-adept> daslicht does offset() give you the same value on each browser?
[10:26:41] <majd> Hey #jquery - i'm trying to use the datepicker ui element, with the beforeShowDay function, but i don't understand how to match the date value to my days to exclude list...
[10:26:43] <phil-adept> http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[10:27:05] <phil-adept> daslicht: it may account for browser diffrerences yet still give you the correct value back? I dunno, worth trying?
[10:27:09] <daslicht> thnks alot , i am still learning jQuery , I will have a look on it !
[10:27:13] <majd> first, in what format is the date passed to beforeShowDay function?
[10:27:55] <phil-adept> daslicht: Let me know how you get on, I'm interested to know if it does account for browser differences
[10:28:12] <daslicht> ok cool i try
[10:28:23] <daslicht> freaking ie9
[10:30:06] <WebDragon> daslicht: what else is new ?
[10:30:25] <daslicht> heh
[10:30:58] <Whirl3d> I was wondering if it would be difficult to wrap jquery in a method that just fed the selector through to jquery, but if no results were returned, a null or undefined would be returned (instead of an empty jquery object of 0 length)?
[10:31:29] <WebDragon> hey did they get the plugins site back up and running fully yet? (I know about the back-up of the old site -- was wondering about the new one)
[10:31:46] <ajpiano> WebDragon: no, we are still working on that
[10:31:48] <CoolCoder> How to calculate the coordinates of a mouse on top of a div(coordinates should be corresponding to the div over which mouse is moving)
[10:31:58] <ShawnRisk> fris: I tried that and no luck
[10:31:59] <WebDragon> ajpiano: dang. monumental task
[10:32:05] <ShawnRisk> hi Whirl3d
[10:32:05] <WebDragon> good luck with it
[10:32:23] <Whirl3d> hi ShawnRisk, how's it goin'
[10:32:34] <johnkpaul> ?eval var tmp = $;$=function(){var result = tmp.apply(this,arguments);return result ? result : null};$();
[10:32:37] <bot-t> johnkpaul: []
[10:32:48] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: crazy have one more problem
[10:32:50] <ShawnRisk> how do I call js files within a colorbox window? I am calling an external div from another page, and I need to render js into this content so that the content is useable.
[10:32:54] * WebDragon slides the DragonCoffee™ carafe over to ajpiano along with a stack of Dunkin Donuts 
[10:32:59] <ajpiano> indeed
[10:33:02] <c0d3Rg1rl> Whirl3d: You could use .get(0) to check for existing, returns undefined if selector not found
[10:33:04] * ajpiano chomp
[10:33:26] <johnkpaul> ?eval var tmp = $;$=function(){var result = tmp.apply(this,arguments);return result.length!==0 ? result : null};$();
[10:33:27] <bot-t> johnkpaul: null
[10:33:35] <Joooonathan> anyone know how to find the actual element that started the transition event in jquery mobile? and sorry for asking here but the right channel is dead
[10:33:47] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: isn't that what you're looking for?
[10:33:54] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, precisely. Thanks.
[10:34:07] <ShawnRisk> unless I call the whole page, the js will not carry over
[10:34:25] <johnkpaul> np, have fun
[10:34:35] <Zzaichik> Who programmed during the netscape IE6 − 7 era?
[10:34:48] <Zzaichik> How did you do it and not go postal?! haha
[10:34:52] <WebDragon> heh no shit
[10:35:05] <WebDragon> lots of css hacks
[10:35:08] <c0d3Rg1rl> Zzaichik: used a lot of alert()s
[10:35:19] <Whirl3d> c0d3Rg1rl, thank for the reply. I am not having problems checking to see if it exists, it just flows better for me to do something like var test=$(".testClass")||$("<div class='testClass"/>");
[10:35:21] <Zzaichik> haha
[10:35:36] <ShawnRisk> Zzaichik: I did and it was fun
[10:35:43] <Zzaichik> liar!!
[10:35:47] <WebDragon> lots of poking IE with a sharp stick until it agreed to do what we wanted
[10:35:50] <c0d3Rg1rl> Whirl3d: ok ic.
[10:36:04] <Zzaichik> haha - yeah
[10:36:13] <_slb> if i use .load to load an html file but that loaded html file has its own javascript and i use $(function() in it nothing happens..how can i instantiate the javascript in that file without putting the code in the file that does the loading
[10:36:39] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: thoughts on my problem?
[10:37:06] <Zzaichik> I'm just admiring how awesome IE7 is, try to get tricky and set the width dynamically and IE shits itself, sets the width to about half the actual width. lol - too much fun.
[10:37:33] * c0d3Rg1rl started javascript with netscape 1.2, those were the days of img.src changes with mouseover and mousout
[10:38:02] <Zzaichik> haha - that was about when it was called livescript too huh
[10:38:05] <Whirl3d> ShawnRisk, you need to have embedded in the code you are loading something which you know how to select (an 'id' attribute or class or something).  Then you can reference it as part of the dom, unless it's loaded in an iframe. Then, I don't know. You could check the colorbox api
[10:39:04] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: it is the js that is not loading
[10:39:32] <Whirl3d> make your scripts external and use $.loadScript? I dunno
[10:39:50] <daslicht> @phil-adept:	I cecked offset but it seems to be the NOT the fault of: css('marginLeft') and css('top')
[10:39:53] <Whirl3d> load your external scripts through ajax and append them to the document <head>
[10:40:10] <daslicht> looks like that the animate properties itself do not do the job properly on IE9
[10:40:25] <daslicht> i try it with fixed values now to verify it
[10:41:52] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: the head of the colorbox?
[10:42:18] <daslicht> the animate function is working :)
[10:42:48] <phil-adept> daslicht: right, so it's calculating the correct positions for the elements?
[10:43:05] <daslicht> still not sure
[10:43:11] <daslicht> i try to use teh offset now
[10:43:32] <daslicht> so far i validated the return values alone
[10:43:34] <phil-adept> daslicht: when you use web-dev tools in ie9, can you seem the css changing on the element as the animation takes place?
[10:43:39] <daslicht> and they were all correct
[10:43:44] <daslicht> verry strange
[10:43:59] <phil-adept> daslicht: so in each browser, offset() returned the same value each time?
[10:44:12] <daslicht> let me try brb
[10:44:28] <daslicht> even css('top') is returning the corect values
[10:44:36] <daslicht> as well as marginLeft
[10:44:46] <Whirl3d> ShawnRisk, you would be wise to seek the advice of someone who has used Colorbox before. I have never used a plugin like that, so I am not really a good reference to call on
[10:44:54] <xmaddness> Is there something in the trigger() functionality that has anything against passing a date option to a custom bind?
[10:44:59] <phil-adept> daslicht: right, then that points to an issue with rendering elements in the browser
[10:45:09] <xmaddness> s/date option/date object
[10:45:28] <daslicht> i have noticed that css() returns values after the econd execute , not the first
[10:45:44] <daslicht> i keep delving 8`>
[10:46:03] <retrostyle|15> anyone knows a good html5 editor?
[10:46:05] <phil-adept> daslicht: No worries, give me a shout if you need a hand
[10:46:20] <daslicht> thank you !
[10:49:44] <habahaba> hello. i ased earlier about where to put jquery code and some one said at the end of <body>. does it have to be at the end? can't it be anywhere in body?
[10:50:25] <xmaddness> Well, attaching to the body will still allow it to run anywhere
[10:50:40] <xmaddness> It doesn't have to go right where it is being executed
[10:51:12] <habahaba> ok that means i can put it anywhere in body then
[10:51:42] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, I had one minor change to your code: thanks again.....   var tmp = $;$=function(){var result = tmp.apply(this,arguments);return result.length ? result : null};
[10:52:04] <habahaba> thank  you xmaddness
[10:52:44] <readme> Hi, I'm using jquery in a circumstance where some other script has taken over '$' after jquery has been run. I have no control over the other scripts, as this is a chrome extension. Is there another name in jquery I can use to get a hold of it?
[10:52:52] <readme> I tried jQuery and did not have any luck with that.
[10:53:50] <ShawnRisk> hi Whirl3d
[10:54:05] <ShawnRisk> had internet problems
[10:54:49] <Whirl3d> ShawnRisk, you would be wise to seek the advice of someone who has used Colorbox before. I have never used a plugin like that, so I am not really a good reference to call on
[10:55:04] <ShawnRisk> ok
[10:55:10] <ShawnRisk> thanks
[10:55:15] <daslicht> @phil-adept:	something like animation....( marginLeft: parseInt(offset.left == -125 ? 125 : 0) ....is working
[10:55:31] <c0d3Rg1rl> readme: does this help? http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries
[10:55:50] <readme> c0d3Rg1rl: i'm afraid that might not be enough to fix this
[10:55:57] <readme> but I am double checking
[10:56:28] <ShawnRisk> how do I call js files within a colorbox window? I am calling an external div from another page, and I need to render js into this content so that the content is useable.
[10:59:07] <Bartzy> How can I abort an ajax request, but not only abort the various callbacks -but actually canceling - like pressing on the stop button ?
[10:59:11] <daslicht> 	@phil-adept: is there something like offset but relative to the elements parent ?
[10:59:35] <Whirl3d> .position()
[10:59:53] <readme> c0d3Rg1rl: on closer inspection it seems I have jquery when I'm running my script, but after it exits I can no longer access jQuery. Not even if I make a global variable. Oh well.

[11:00:36] <oymyakon> hello everyone. Can somebody help me? this behaviour is very weird. When I call ajaxSetup beforeSend and set custom headers with setRequestHeader my request magically becomes OPTIONS instead of GET
[11:00:37] <Whirl3d> or jsfiddle
[11:00:46] <LukeNukem> Hello, im doing an ajax request
[11:00:51] <LukeNukem> but instead its just reloading the page
[11:01:14] <LukeNukem> i submit the form using jquery since its hidden, and then i do a onsubmit event to do an ajax request
[11:03:04] <c0d3Rg1rl> ShawnRisk: there is this "Outside HTML (Ajax)" demo on colorbox homepage, it reads an external div and executes a script within external file (sets the red color). Are you looking for this?
[11:04:45] <retrostyle|15> anyone knows a html editor with autocompletion and formattng?
[11:07:37] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: do you 'return false' at end of onsubmit-handler?
[11:07:48] <Whirl3d> phped, ultraedit, aptana, beans
[11:07:56] <LukeNukem> i do e.preventDefault();
[11:08:00] <LukeNukem> on top of it
[11:08:05] <ShawnRisk> c0d3Rg1rl: looking now
[11:09:47] <ShawnRisk> c0d3Rg1rl: do you want to see the link?
[11:11:29] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: mybe this is your problem: "After this code executes, clicks on Trigger the handler will also display the message. In addition, the default submit action on the form will be fired, so the form will be submitted."
[11:11:33] <c0d3Rg1rl> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[11:12:48] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: you could try a submit with a visible submit-button to check if there is a  difference.
[11:12:54] <c0d3Rg1rl> ShawnRisk: sure
[11:13:37] <LukeNukem> codelahoma, okay
[11:14:29] <stelt_> http://pastie.org/private/h6aytk6wnqkjrs93nmb3rg gives no errors, seems only to load 1st referenced script, nothing happens on swipe
[11:14:36] * stelt_ is a jquery newbie
[11:15:20] <ShawnRisk> c0d3Rg1rl: pmed you
[11:15:26] <stelt_> readme, better now?
[11:15:33] <LukeNukem> c0d3Rg1rl, i did not put in a submit button because i was submitting via jquery using .submit
[11:15:57] <em0vskangoura> I am trying to do something like this : 		jQuery(".sub").hover( function(event){
[11:15:57] <em0vskangoura> 			                              jQuery(this).next(":button").css("background-color","red");   }
[11:15:59] <FLeiXiuS> If 'this' refers to 'i.hello' and I have an anchor within that tag, how can I reference the anchor
[11:16:07] <FLeiXiuS> li.hello*
[11:16:27] <em0vskangoura> To change a buttons background which is inside a div but it won't work. Any ideas ?
[11:16:44] <LukeNukem> c0d3Rg1rl, i added the submit button, but still it just reloads the page
[11:17:07] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: a real submit-button, not a submit() call?
[11:17:29] <LukeNukem> c0d3Rg1rl, do you want me to submit it via a submit button?
[11:17:57] <Whirl3d> em0vskangoura, $(".sub").hover(function (e) {$(this).css("backgroundColor",red); var anch=$(this).find('anch");  ....
[11:17:59] <motaka2> can I add javascript code to a page using jquery ajax ?
[11:18:18] <LukeNukem> c0d3Rg1rl, ok it works with a visible one
[11:18:47] <c0d3Rg1rl> ok. so it's the line I quoted from api-docs.
[11:19:00] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: "In addition, the default submit action on the form will be fired"
[11:19:04] <MickeySoFine> hi all
[11:19:24] <NoiseEee> em0vskangoura: recreate a js fiddle
[11:19:36] <em0vskangoura> Whirl3d: the $ is jQuery for Drupal forgot to change it, ill try your changes
[11:19:48] <LukeNukem> c0d3Rg1rl, well i dont want to show that button there
[11:19:50] <em0vskangoura> NoiseEee
[11:19:52] <MickeySoFine> how do I access a html5 data attr from and click event?
[11:20:01] <em0vskangoura> thanks ill try itsometime and ill ask for help then ok ?
[11:21:23] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: I know, you have to rethink the way of submit and preventing the default.
[11:22:50] <LukeNukem> c0d3Rg1rl, :\ so using .submit with an invisible button is impossibru?
[11:25:51] <warrenparsons> MickeySoFine: $('#myElement').on('click', function(){ var myDataValue = $(this).data('myDataAttribute'); }
[11:26:56] <warrenparsons> Blah, forgot the trailing paren.
[11:27:21] <MickeySoFine> thanks warrenparsons !
[11:28:19] <warrenparsons> MickeySoFine: Also important to remember: This - <div id="myDiv" data-myData="x"> corresponds to $('#myDiv').data('myData');
[11:28:21] <MagePsycho> i would like to know how it can be accomplished with jquery: http://www.dealextreme.com/c/hobbies-toys-899 (note the product image load on scrolling)
[11:28:52] <Qalqi> how do i select an element with a particular attribute say 'value=department'?
[11:29:09] <warrenparsons> MagePsycho: It's called Lazy Loading. There are tons of plugins for it.
[11:29:16] <xmaddness> yeh
[11:29:58] <MagePsycho> warrenparsons: note that only image is loaded (frame is already there)
[11:29:59] <LukeNukem> does this look fine
[11:29:59] <LukeNukem>       var link_prefix_split = link_prefix.split(",");
[11:29:59] <LukeNukem>       var link_prefix_input = link_prefix_split[0];
[11:31:01] <Whirl3d> and when do you plan to have your new social network go public, LukemNukem?
[11:31:46] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, a lot of its done, i just need to re-write the sql queries in prepared statements. RIght now im trying to grab data from external pages realtime ^_^
[11:32:55] <LukeNukem> is it me or it wont split using a coma?
[11:34:12] <LukeNukem> any idea Whirl3d ?
[11:34:16] <daslicht> @phil-adept:	i found the error, it is the top attribute , on firefox it is interrpreted as a negative value , on ie9 its interpreted as positive !
[11:34:58] <Whirl3d> probably the most common use of split is with the comma.
[11:35:09] <Whirl3d> I use split with a comma every day
[11:35:23] <LukeNukem> are you being sarcastic, because i think you are.
[11:35:44] <Whirl3d> var list="1,2,3,4,5".split(",");
[11:36:18] <Whirl3d> returns an array of elements (0-based) ["1","2","3","4","5"];
[11:36:45] <LukeNukem> i wonder why it does not work for what im doing :\
[11:36:55] <LukeNukem> because i just did the 1,2,3 thing and it worked
[11:37:04] <Whirl3d> so if you want the third element in your list after applying String.split() to a string, you refer to the element, not the String.split method
[11:37:27] <Whirl3d> lst[2], not String.split()[2]
[11:37:29] <daslicht> so funky
[11:37:30] <daslicht> :)
[11:38:06] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, i dont understand mate
[11:38:38] <Whirl3d> or you could do "1,2,3".split(",")[2]   whcih evaluates the split, then returns the third element in the result
[11:38:42] <daslicht> so the manufactures of browsers make thinks to inconsistent that people canb make money out of fixing inconsitencies ?
[11:38:44] <daslicht> lol
[11:39:16] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, that would be like 12, 3
[11:39:47] <Whirl3d> var list=somestring.split(someString)    will return an array....to access members of an array, you select them using a zero-index:    so list[2] would be the third element
[11:40:15] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: not impossibru, you need to work harder</High Expectations Asian Father>
[11:40:40] <LukeNukem> okay
[11:40:49] <Whirl3d> this is not even js101...this is the kind of thng that they kick you out of school if you don't know
[11:42:10] <LukeNukem> my school does not know what js is
[11:42:11] <LukeNukem> ^.^
[11:42:34] <xmaddness> yeah I don't we ever covered js in school
[11:42:38] <xmaddness> or anything web related
[11:42:59] <Whirl3d> xmaddness, I'm 41. They covered arrays in junior high. Give me a break.
[11:43:13] <xmaddness> I said js
[11:43:16] <Whirl3d> It's not a js thing or particular to any language
[11:43:17] <xmaddness> not arrays
[11:43:23] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: LukeNukem is in junior high.
[11:43:24] <ajpiano> :|
[11:43:27] <xmaddness> of course they covered arrays
[11:43:40] <ajpiano> i don't know how he is able to spend all these days on IRC :p
[11:43:54] <xmaddness> and i'm right behind you on the age ;)
[11:44:17] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, i am in junior high
[11:44:24] <LukeNukem> but they teach us JS
[11:44:28] <smplstk> JS _should_ be taught in High School.
[11:44:41] <smplstk> along with like, all the basic web stuffs
[11:44:42] <LukeNukem> i study in the state syllabux
[11:44:44] <Whirl3d> If you are making your own social network, you should know js
[11:44:49] <LukeNukem> they just reached html
[11:45:01] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, im learning ;), this stupid split im having a problem with
[11:45:07] <Whirl3d> if you are making your own social network on the backs of generous people in an irc channel---that's rough
[11:45:13] <xmaddness> lol
[11:45:25] <xmaddness> and you will probably be done sometim in the next couple decades
[11:45:53] <xmaddness> they didn't even teach computers in my high school
[11:45:56] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, i began like that well now i know jquery a bit more and js too so yeah ill live :D i just come here when im stuck now
[11:45:57] <LukeNukem> and thats a lot lol
[11:45:58] <xmaddness> it was just typing
[11:46:14] <Whirl3d> but the thing is that I am all for sharing and learning and discussing. But you can only give someone the answer and then argue with them so many times before it stops being fun
[11:46:16] <xmaddness> well, we learned how to draw with a turtle
[11:46:19] <xmaddness> that was it
[11:46:48] <xmaddness> and basic
[11:46:54] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, i tried your solutions, i just cant seem to get it to work
[11:46:58] <Whirl3d> LukeNukem, or just take the stuff that people give you and look it up--study up on it and ask questions
[11:47:24] <Whirl3d> How much time have you spent with the javascript api or even google looking up Split?
[11:48:53] <Whirl3d> There are some great resources out there and this forum is absolutely the best! But when it gets great is when people take what they are given, looki it up, study it, and return when they have questions. There's a real value in helping someone to learn--not just to solve an immediate propblem
[11:49:04] <sterlo> i have this problem where on keydown (pressing enter) blur() is being called twice... CODE: https://gist.github.com/ce26d8dd9d50cfb31143 - desired results are any time someone unfocuses an input, it preforms an action. I also want that same action performed if they hit enter. But I don't want the form to submit.
[11:49:15] <CoolCoder> How to get mouse position with respect to parent element?
[11:49:53] <xmaddness> sterlo, sounds like you may need to use stopPropogation

[11:50:58] <Mage_Dude> Can someone explain the Key/Value pairs for the data: part of an ajax request? Is it key:value? Does it need wrapping in quotes or braces?
[11:51:17] <Hawkee> smplstk, they taught me Pascal in high school :)
[11:51:19] <Whirl3d> CoolCoder, the problem is the mouse doesn't have a parent element?

[11:52:31] * stelt_ looking for minimal swipe example
[11:52:46] * xmaddness just left a cobol shop
[11:53:48] <Hawkee> Whirl3d, nice.  I covered Fortran in my programming history class in college
[11:54:28] <Whirl3d> CoolCoder, semantically you should avoid trying to find the parent element of themouse. You can find the mouse coordinates relative to the page (e.pagex and y, I think) and then the coordinates of your suspected "parent" element using .offset()
[11:54:59] <Whirl3d> so, bind a mousemove handler to the element you want to get the mouse cooordinates relative to
[11:55:05] <CoolCoder> ok
[11:55:48] <c0d3Rg1rl_> hm, got disconnected
[11:56:39] <Whirl3d> $("div.b').mousemove(function (e) { var offset=$(this).offset(); var mousex=e.pagex, var mousey=e.pagey; var relx=mousex-offset.left, rely=mousey-offset.top;  })   ----basically  (I proably messed up some caps or something)

[11:57:23] <braddunbar> I'm seeing an IE bug in which setting an elements innerHTML sometimes clears the html of some of it's child elements.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?
[11:57:27] <Eviltwin> i.imgur.com/VPcFx.jpg

I can't use $("input.sphinx").val() because the autocomplete function binds to different input boxes
[11:58:46] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: Right, but doesn't change the innerHTML of it's current children, correct?
[12:00:10] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: var p = $('<p><a>foo</a></p>'), a = p.find('a'); p.html('<a></a>'); console.log(a.html());
[12:00:22] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: This should log `foo` right?

[12:03:01] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: Yes, but the pervious contents are still the same.

[12:03:45] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: Despite having been replaced, the contents of the previous child elements is still the same.
[12:04:32] <Eviltwin> Wait, what do you think should be happening here?
[12:05:09] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: That fiddle behaves how I expect it to.
[12:05:18] <Eviltwin> Okay...
[12:05:33] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: I'm saying that in IE in a specific situation I'm seeing that behave differently...
[12:05:41] <braddunbar> ...and wanted to know if anyone had encountered it before.
[12:06:06] <Eviltwin> Does that fiddle work in IE?
[12:06:21] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: I believe so, yes
[12:06:40] <Eviltwin> Can you make a fiddle that does this other thing in IE
[12:06:51] <Eviltwin> Just isolating the issue
[12:06:59] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: No, I haven't been able to create a reduced test case.
[12:08:37] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: Actually, it appears to work differently in IE.  Can you verify?  http://jsfiddle.net/Hej6h/1/
[12:08:47] <Eviltwin> I don't have IE
[12:09:06] <Eviltwin> At least not on this machine
[12:09:08] <braddunbar> Can someone else verify the behavior of http://jsfiddle.net/Hej6h/1/ in IE9?
[12:11:08] <Haprog> braddunbar: doesn't work in IE9
[12:11:11] <Haprog> blank result
[12:11:24] <Whirl3d> WOW. I just learned something so basic about jquery that I am embarrassed to admit it. I really had no idea that your jquery object existed even if your dom element (that was listed in your jquery object) was removed...
[12:11:44] <braddunbar> Haprog: Huh...
[12:12:01] <braddunbar> Haprog: I'm getting that too...has to be a bug of some sort right?
[12:12:04] <Haprog> yup. weird
[12:12:37] <Eviltwin> braddunbar, Haprog: What about this? http://jsfiddle.net/Hej6h/5/
[12:12:41] <Eviltwin> And do you get errors?
[12:12:52] <Haprog> I just ran into some really weird shit bug in IE8 and older today also relating to usage of html() and append()
[12:12:58] <Haprog> just trying to isolate it
[12:13:24] <ShawnRisk> well I didn't get an closer to solving the problem
[12:13:28] <Haprog> seems like I don't get the same behavior on my home PC that I did at work though. maybe some bug in IETester though.
[12:13:34] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: No, no errors.
[12:13:56] <Hawkee> suppose I have a function attached to a particular class
[12:14:07] <Hawkee> and I add another object with that class to the page via ajax
[12:14:09] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: I get no result with that either.
[12:14:14] <Haprog> braddunbar: same. just blank. no errors.
[12:14:17] <Hawkee> how can I make sure the same function gets attached to it?
[12:14:25] <Haprog> oops I meant Eviltwin
[12:17:28] <DormantOden> hey, I'm trying to use .load() to load content from an external html file. The problem is that any javascript within the external page throws errors. Does anyone have any idea how I can fix this?
[12:18:09] <braddunbar> Here's a jQueryless example: http://jsfiddle.net/Hej6h/6/
[12:18:14] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: Haprog: ^^
[12:18:28] <braddunbar> Seems that this should be documented somewhere...
[12:18:44] <ShawnRisk> how do I call js files within a colorbox window? I am calling an external div from another page, and I need to render js into this content so that the content is useable.
[12:19:27] <c0d3Rg1rl> ShawnRisk: The content of your external div is filtered, I just explained it to you in PM
[12:20:13] <ShawnRisk> c0d3Rg1rl: sorry I might have missed that.  What do I do?
[12:20:30] <c0d3Rg1rl> ShawnRisk: re-read the 3-page msg-conversation
[12:21:04] <smplstk> Hawkee: right, _so_ useful
[12:21:24] <Hawkee> =)
[12:21:39] <ShawnRisk> c0d3Rg1rl: I just did and I see what you mean, and I am filtering this but shouldn't the js move through with this or only the html?
[12:21:40] <Hawkee> I made millipede in that class
[12:21:49] <Hawkee> drawing dots on a screen
[12:21:53] <Hawkee> that was fun
[12:22:43] <Hawkee> alright, who can help me here.. suppose I have $('.autocomplete').autocomplete( ? ) in my document ready and I add an new .autocomplete element via ajax, how can I get this function attached to the new element?
[12:22:45] <c0d3Rg1rl> ShawnRisk: the script tags do not end up in your colorbox popup. so they can't "work"
[12:23:57] <ShawnRisk> c0d3Rg1rl: yes but why?  I don't want to load the whole page.
[12:24:09] <ShawnRisk> because it is filtered but it should come through
[12:24:11] <braddunbar> Eviltwin: It appears that el.html() is not quite the same as el.empty().append() - http://jsfiddle.net/Hej6h/9/
[12:24:15] <braddunbar> (At least not in IE)
[12:24:28] <braddunbar> Oops...http://jsfiddle.net/Hej6h/12/
[12:25:50] <Hawkee> looks like I need to use .live()
[12:26:07] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[12:26:11] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live, it's deprecated
[12:26:19] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate or .on in jQuery 1.7+
[12:26:20] <c0d3Rg1rl> ShawnRisk: I already explained to you that you should ask the original coders how the popup is created and then add your code there
[12:26:23] <LukeNukem> hey Eviltwin how you doin
[12:26:35] <Hawkee> actually, looks like .on
[12:26:39] <Hawkee> right Eviltwin
[12:26:48] <ShawnRisk> c0d3Rg1rl: right and will do that
[12:27:03] <c0d3Rg1rl> so why are you askingthe very same question again?
[12:27:08] <Hawkee> what's the difference between .on and .delegate?
[12:27:18] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, hey i still haven't solved that splitting thingie
[12:27:28] <Eviltwin> The difference is you should use .on in 1.7+ and you should use .delegate in <1.7
[12:28:11] <Hawkee> .on it is then
[12:28:21] <LukeNukem> .live for life
[12:28:22] <LukeNukem> just kidding ;)
[12:28:42] <LukeNukem>       var link_prefix_split = link_prefix.split(",");
[12:28:42] <LukeNukem>       alert(link_prefix_split[0]);
[12:28:53] <Eviltwin> ?alert
[12:28:54] <bot-t> Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[12:28:58] <VioByte> Ok, whats the most common problem when setting a div as draggable but yet it does not drag?
[12:29:57] <LukeNukem> [00:59:43.908] link_prefix.split is not a function @ http://localhost/includes/scripts/index.js:84
[12:30:02] <LukeNukem> but split is a function o.o
[12:31:44] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: mybe link_prefix is not a string?
[12:32:12] <LukeNukem> c0d3Rg1rl, i get it from regexp
[12:32:32] <LukeNukem> when alerted it returns
[12:32:33] <c0d3Rg1rl> show the line
[12:32:43] <LukeNukem> var linkprefix = string.match(/(http:\/\/\S+)/);
[12:32:54] <LukeNukem> i changed link_prefix to linkprefix
[12:34:12] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: "This method returns an array of matches, or null if no match is found."
[12:34:33] <LukeNukem> yes
[12:34:47] <LukeNukem> it just returns the same url twice
[12:34:51] <LukeNukem> i want to split that into 1
[12:35:08] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: you got an array back.
[12:35:11] <c0d3Rg1rl> use array[0]
[12:35:28] <c0d3Rg1rl> and do not use alert(), see bot-t.
[12:35:34] <ShawnRisk> c0d3Rg1rl: thanks for all the help
[12:35:50] <Whirl3d> LukeNukem, first....lookup arrays and how they work. Seriously. I think that will solve a lot of your issues right now
[12:36:24] <c0d3Rg1rl> Whirl3d: yes.
[12:37:26] <LukeNukem> c0d3Rg1rl, i did not think about that, thanks :)
[12:38:01] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: an array does not have a function split(), that explains your errormessage.
[12:38:12] <jita> How could i find all the divisions of particular class inside a division ?
[12:38:45] <LukeNukem> one doubt c0d3Rg1rl  why does it have the same links two times anyway
[12:38:55] <Sypris> Hello!
[12:39:12] <z1000> anyone know of a SINGLE file uploader that works with IE and has drag/drop ?
[12:39:13] <c0d3Rg1rl> jita: $('#outer-div div.particular-class')
[12:39:28] <LukeNukem> z1000, try uploadify
[12:39:31] <c0d3Rg1rl> LukeNukem: read match() docs
[12:40:51] <z1000> doesnt  seem to have drag/drop LukeNukem :( - I would use this but its just way too bulky for only needing 1 file? http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[12:42:45] <Sypris> Hey guys i'm using .ajax POST to chuck an ID to a php page that deletes from mysql. The js/ajax side seems to be working and firebug says the POST is giving the correct value, but it just doesn't want to run the php page.  Anyone have experience with this kind of thing?
[12:44:01] <jita> c0d3Rg1rl, can't use find ?
[12:44:46] <LukeNukem> Sypris, what exactly?
[12:46:50] <daslicht> is thate a way that i can make a negative value positive or a positive value negative ?  eg: convert -125 to 125
[12:47:08] <daslicht> there
[12:47:27] <daslicht> Math.abs(x)  ?
[12:47:38] <NihilistDandy> That only does half the job
[12:47:54] <c0d3Rg1rl> daslicht: x = x * -1;
[12:48:12] <NihilistDandy> ^
[12:48:18] <daslicht> ok thank you , I am going to try it now
[12:48:28] <NihilistDandy> Or subtract from 0
[12:48:36] <NihilistDandy> x = 0 - x
[12:49:58] <c0d3Rg1rl> looks like #math101
[12:50:40] <c0d3Rg1rl> jita: you can use find as well. depends of your particular needs.
[12:51:03] <jita> c0d3Rg1rl, ok thanks
[12:51:16] <daslicht> hah yeah i remember it vague , some year behind today
[12:51:30] <daslicht> thnak you !
[12:53:41] <Hawkee> alright, so I'm using .on('focus', function(event) { $(this).autocomplete({ ?.. }); }); to attach an autocomplete to dynamically added elements, but it doesn't seem to be working, any problems with this?
[12:53:48] <rabbi1> I have used Date Range, but in the 'to' field it shows the future dates disabled and previous dates selectable, exactly the opposite as shown in the demo :( Strange. any suggestions ?
[12:54:21] <Hawkee> it works for the first element that's loaded upon the initial page load
[12:54:25] <Hawkee> but not for the newly created elements
[12:55:40] <shiva_> hello there, i have a tabbed panel, I want to assign jscrollpane to each of the pane, however it seems lile it does't add jscroll to those panel which the tab is not active, how can i assign a function to a hidden div?
[13:01:53] <rabbi1> I have used Date Range, but in the 'to' field it shows the future dates disabled and previous dates selectable, exactly the opposite as shown in the demo :( Strange. any suggestions ?
[13:05:09] <besimo> check out what i did with jquery
[13:05:12] <besimo> http://vipmeup.net
[13:05:21] <besimo> a nice project made by me and 2 other guys
[13:05:41] <dabear> besimo: ok?
[13:05:51] <dabear> you need help with anything?
[13:06:17] <Qalqi> besimo: wat i sit about?
[13:06:20] <besimo> no. just wanted to show whats possbile with jquery
[13:06:40] <xmaddness> heh
[13:06:44] <Qalqi> besimo: how much time did it take?
[13:06:45] <besimo> primary: for getting famous. secondary: charity
[13:06:49] <besimo> 6 month
[13:06:49] <xmaddness> just wait til you see what we have cooked up with jQuery
[13:06:55] <besimo> from conecpt to release
[13:07:07] <besimo> what do you think about it? first impression?
[13:07:15] <Whirl3d> Here's an interesting question....how do I make an object that only returns dom elements that exist? like var slides=$(".slide');  then $(".slide").remove();  console.log(slides)....you get the list of removed elements. I would like to have a proxy function that returns null or undefined ...
[13:07:29] <rabbi1> what's happening to me ?
[13:07:30] <Qalqi> besimo : better option to get famous and charity is to become jesus
[13:07:41] <xmaddness> Although I can't release any info about it until release :x
[13:07:52] <xmaddness> besimo: looks good
[13:08:00] <Qalqi> xmaddness : why secret ?
[13:08:09] <xmaddness> I work for the mouse
[13:08:28] <besimo> thanks @xmaddness
[13:08:28] <xmaddness> everything is a secret here until release
[13:08:31] <c0d3Rg1rl> rabbi1: nobody knows about date range, so no answer.
[13:08:43] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: by definition, anything you do in $(".foo").remove() will be not in the dom anymore after calling it
[13:08:45] <ajpiano> you can just ditch the object
[13:08:47] <Qalqi> 6 months is pretty huge time
[13:09:11] <besimo> for sure.
[13:09:20] <besimo> but havent worked on it all the time
[13:09:35] <besimo> i am not a student. employeed people dont have that much time
[13:09:47] <c0d3Rg1rl> besimo: centering does not work well
[13:09:51] <xmaddness> yeah unfortunately nothing I code anymore is for me
[13:09:55] <Qalqi> this project is worth the time i guess
[13:09:57] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: if you want you could do something like $.fn.removeAndReturnAnEmptySet = function() { return this.remove().pushStack([]);  };
[13:10:18] <xmaddness> I get home and don't want to look at a computer
[13:10:28] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: :) my code is exactly same provided in the demo, but its acting weired
[13:10:33] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, thanks for the reply. I guess I was hoping for something that worked like a getter/setter does in some languages...you know where you can say: console.log(this.slides) and it returns the results of this.getSlides() or something...
[13:10:46] <Qalqi> xmaddness : seems like I am going to be like that soon
[13:10:52] <Qalqi> hating computers
[13:11:07] <besimo> yeah, it is not 100 % perfect...which browser you are using?
[13:11:14] <xmaddness> well, I don't hate em, I am just on them all day at work, and don't really have the time at home
[13:11:35] <c0d3Rg1rl> besimo: the space on the left, is it unused? ffox10
[13:11:38] <Hawkee> what should I use to attach a function via .on to a textarea?  I tried .on('focus' and it didn't attach
[13:11:53] <besimo> the space on the left is only used for twitter.
[13:11:56] <Whirl3d> to be honest, I thought (this entire time) that jquery did that. LOL I figured if the dom element was removedit would update the jquery object...but I see now that it doesn't.
[13:11:59] <c0d3Rg1rl> rabbi1: if the demo works, your code is wrong ;)
[13:12:31] <xmaddness> Hawkee ,trigger('focus',
[13:12:32] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: you mean this.slides would call a method under the hood?
[13:12:33] <xmaddness> erm
[13:12:40] <xmaddness> erm wait
[13:12:42] <xmaddness> .bind
[13:12:44] <johnkpaul> that's a feature of a newer version of javascript
[13:12:45] <xmaddness> >_<
[13:12:46] <c0d3Rg1rl> besimo: ok, was blocked by ghostery-addon
[13:12:52] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, yeah...something like that I guess
[13:12:53] <besimo> ah okay. nice.
[13:13:09] <Hawkee> so .bind rather than .on?
[13:13:10] <Whirl3d> it would return a "live" jquery selection
[13:13:11] <besimo> may you can spread it. it is also worth as we donate half of the money.
[13:13:17] <Qalqi> besimo: is this some kind of school prject?
[13:13:19] <besimo> maybe this project gets very big.
[13:13:26] <besimo> no, not a school project
[13:13:35] <Whirl3d> so if I had 5 slides in the dom and removed one, the variable reference would show 4 slides
[13:13:36] <besimo> was an idea while having a bbg
[13:13:38] <besimo> bbq
[13:13:40] <Whirl3d> right now it still shows 5
[13:13:46] <Qalqi> besimo: cheers for u if it really gets big
[13:14:03] <Hawkee> xmaddness, the problem is I only want to attach the function one time
[13:14:12] <Hawkee> here's what I've got, .on('focus', function(event) { $(this).autocomplete({ ?.. }); });
[13:14:15] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: jQuery object's aren't lazy like that
[13:14:25] <johnkpaul> there's an extension I think called livequery
[13:14:42] <Hawkee> I did see livequery just now, is that the only solution?
[13:14:52] <Hawkee> I'd rather not use an extension or extra code
[13:15:06] <dispyfree112> Hi
[13:15:07] <timwis> Hey guys, jQuery selectors are not dependent on the browser's CSS support are they?
[13:15:14] <Hawkee> I just want to apply autocomplete to dynamically added elements
[13:15:15] <besimo> Qalqi: thanks
[13:15:20] <Whirl3d> <--looking up "lazy" in context for clarification.
[13:15:21] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: no way, checked it many times
[13:15:31] <johnkpaul> Hawkee: I don't think it's a good idea, there should be a better way do handle what you're trying to do
[13:15:36] <rabbi1> anyway, let me recheck after i have a sound sleep ;)
[13:15:44] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: look for lazy evaluation
[13:15:54] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation#Controlling_eagerness_in_lazy_languages
[13:16:00] <c0d3Rg1rl> rabbi1: so the official demo works? and your code is based on demo and does not work?
[13:16:04] <Whirl3d> jsut did. that's what I want... a lazy-ass jquery
[13:16:06] <Whirl3d> lol
[13:16:11] <johnkpaul> timwis: no, it is not
[13:16:13] <Hawkee> johnkpaul, you don't think it's a good idea to use .on to attach an autocomplete to dynamic elements?
[13:16:15] <johnkpaul> haha, Whirl3d that's hilarious
[13:16:38] <johnkpaul> you should tweet that or something
[13:16:41] <timwis> johnkpaul: any idea why $('input[name="dFormUdf$80"]') would find the element in chrome/ffox but not in IE7?
[13:16:52] <johnkpaul> Hawkee: that depends on what you mean by "using" on
[13:17:05] <johnkpaul> timwis: my complete and utter guess would be something about the $
[13:17:10] <johnkpaul> in the name
[13:17:16] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: works, that has got from date and to date. the to date should not allow the date to be selected before the from date. but its working the other way around. it is allowing the dates before the from date, instead of after the from dates
[13:17:20] <timwis> johnkpaul oh...can I escape it or something?
[13:17:31] <johnkpaul> I don't know, it's a complete guess
[13:18:06] <Hawkee> johnkpaul, did you see the code I just pasted?  This is how I'm using .on
[13:18:26] <c0d3Rg1rl> rabbi1: post url of demo and your code
[13:18:30] <johnkpaul> no, I'm guessing that was before I Joined the conversation
[13:18:49] <Hawkee> johnkpaul, $('.autocomplete').on('focus', function(event) { $(this).autocomplete({ ?.. }); });
[13:18:50] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: there's a way that you can approximate it
[13:18:59] <johnkpaul> I think that jquery objects have a selector property
[13:18:59] <Hawkee> this is for textareas with the autocomplete class
[13:19:07] <matthijs> how would I remove a callback from ajaxPrefilter after adding one?
[13:19:32] <bjensen> Um this returned undefined in IE9: var stay_id = $(this).parents('.tabsdiv').attr('data-stay-id'); but works fine in firefox and chrome..am I missing something?
[13:19:36] <johnkpaul> Hawkee: oh, so you want to delegate that, that's fine I'd say
[13:19:37] <shiva_> hey, how can i assifn a function to a hidden element?
[13:19:48] <johnkpaul> I don't remember the correct params to on off the top of my head
[13:19:57] <johnkpaul> ?eval $("#test").selector
[13:20:01] <bot-t> johnkpaul: "#test"
[13:20:11] <johnkpaul> so Whirl3d, you can use that
[13:20:11] <c0d3Rg1rl> timwis: IE7 seems to handle the $ well: http://jsfiddle.net/kjMaJ/
[13:20:18] <Hawkee> johnkpaul, the problem is that when I load another textarea with that particular class through ajax the autocomplete doesn't work
[13:20:19] <timwis> johnkpaul: actually it seems like it's selecting it in IE7 but when I try to .hide() it it isn't hiding it
[13:20:24] <Hawkee> so it's just not triggering
[13:20:49] <Hawkee> I'm guessing I'm doing something wrong
[13:21:11] <johnkpaul> Hawkee: yeah, the parameters to .on are incorrect
[13:21:14] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: http://paste.ubuntu.com/883836/
[13:21:15] <Whirl3d> so I could extend jquery with an "update" or "current" method that would reselect it's contents using the original selector?
[13:21:25] <johnkpaul> Hawkee: http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[13:21:43] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: yes, you could, but the question would then be, why make theq uery in the first place
[13:21:52] <c0d3Rg1rl> rabbi1: can only help if you post the live page or an extract in jsfiddle.net
[13:22:13] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: also, it's javascript, you can monkey patch almost anything if you _really_ wanted to
[13:22:18] <johnkpaul> :)
[13:22:25] <Qalqi> wats difference between function(){ function(){bla}, function(){bla}}; and $(document).ready()(function(){function(){bla};)};
[13:22:27] <c0d3Rg1rl> timwis: in above jsfiddle, IE7 finds the input
[13:22:39] <Qalqi> i mean when to use , and when ;?
[13:23:03] <timwis> c0d3Rg1rl: yeah now that I analyse it it does seem to find the input, but i can't seem to hide() it. Even when I tried with css (display: none) it didn't hide it in IE7
[13:23:35] <rwik> Hello all! I am not experienced with jquery or js, but I am trying to get the table of contents found here http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/jquery-plugin-smooth-scrolling/ to work, but I am having some issues. I put the .js library on the server, and I call it in a <script> tag, but it is not generating the toc. It comes with a html file, and I use that same syntax as is in the html doc,
[13:23:40] <rwik> but I receive an "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'stoc'" error. I know the syntax is right (its directly from the file!) and I know it can read the js file (I can see it in sources in the inpect element scripts tag), so what else can go wrong?
[13:23:43] <matthijs> Good evening, working on unit tests here, I want to check the options of an outgoing ajax request - I'm using ajaxPrefilter to check so, but I need restore the entire jquery object to default settings between tests somehow?
[13:23:52] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, I am suddenly hazy about jquery object contents now. Since I thought a jquery object was just a lazy reference to dom elements (for the most part), I never worried about tracking the state of elements in my jquery object...
[13:23:57] <c0d3Rg1rl> timwis: http://jsfiddle.net/kjMaJ/1/ works with hide()
[13:24:35] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: it is not lazy, at the time of creation, jQuery queries the dom, and adds references to the dom elements into the jquery object that is returned
[13:24:54] <Whirl3d> sure. I didn't know that until today tough
[13:24:59] <Hawkee> johnkpaul, I got it.  I needed to do $(document).on('focus', '.autocomplete', function...
[13:25:09] <Whirl3d> so now I have to rethink my state management object
[13:25:11] <johnkpaul> Hawkee: great, I nebver remember those parameters
[13:25:14] <Hawkee> now every time I focus on the same textarea this gets reapplied
[13:25:15] <johnkpaul> I have to look it up every time
[13:25:27] <Hawkee> how can I make it so it doesn't keep getting reapplied once it's already been done?
[13:25:33] <Hawkee> maybe "focus" isn't the best
[13:25:45] <Hawkee> would be nice if there were some onload event I could attach it to
[13:25:58] <Whirl3d> am I managing the state of the dom element of the jquery object's contents. I think this must be the thing that I keep missing...
[13:26:27] <Eviltwin> ?
[13:26:34] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: http://jsfiddle.net/HnwVR/
[13:27:00] <Eviltwin> Hawkee: There are automatic pseudoselectors for jQuery UI widgets
[13:27:17] <Hawkee> Eviltwin, what do you mean?
[13:27:20] <Eviltwin> Hawkee: You can check $(this).is(":ui-autocomplete")
[13:27:23] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: i haven't changed anything from the demo "source code" ....
[13:27:44] <Hawkee> okay, so continue to use "focus" but check for that to determine whether or not I should attach it again
[13:28:11] <Eviltwin> Yeah although I think it generally doesn't hurt to construct a widget on the same element multiple times
[13:28:14] <Eviltwin> I think they safeguard against that
[13:28:54] <Hawkee> so build this as a widget and just construct it for each new element I add?
[13:28:59] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: try selecting the start date - works fine, try selecting the end date - i get to select the previous date than the future ones .. :(
[13:29:15] <timwis> c0d3rg1rl: it is working after all - false alarm on end user's part. thx!
[13:29:33] <Eviltwin> Hawkee: I mean I think doing $(element).autocomplete({...}); $(element).autocomplete({...}); ... doesn't cause a problem
[13:29:49] <besimo> so. thank you guys for your support. would be nice if you could spread the word. just tweet something about #vipmeup
[13:29:54] <besimo> and jquery ROCKS ;)
[13:30:00] <Hawkee> right, but my autocomplete is highly customized and quite a bit of code
[13:30:05] <Hawkee> so I should just make it a widget
[13:30:14] <Hawkee> and call it .customAutocomplete or something
[13:30:23] <Eviltwin> Up to you
[13:30:41] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: what do you mean "the state of the dom element of the jquery object's contents"?
[13:31:13] <c0d3Rg1rl> rabbi1: had to get your jsfiddle to work first: http://jsfiddle.net/HnwVR/2/ - now what should happen if I click what?
[13:31:23] <Hawkee> I need to look into making widgets
[13:31:39] <nick_omega> how should i modify this code so that the dom is not constructed before it is modified http://pastebin.com/SrbJcWDd
[13:31:47] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: sorry, first time. i actually updated anyway
[13:32:24] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: step 1:  select start date, step 2: select the end date
[13:32:26] <johnkpaul> Hawkee: google for addy osmani plugin patterns
[13:32:31] <johnkpaul> and read up on the widget patterns
[13:32:45] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, I have been keeping cached copies of jquery selections that contain elements long removed from the dom. So, when I calculate position based on a cached jquery object and I need to distribute those 5 elements across the screen, it messes up because only 3 elements exist in the dom, for example
[13:33:15] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: So reselect
[13:33:35] <Hawkee> Thank you johnkpaul, I found it
[13:33:49] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: step 3: the end date should not allow me to select the previous dates mentioned in the start date, and i should be able to select the future dates depending on the start date. but it is happening the other way around. The end date is allowing me to select the date previous to the start date not the date future to the start date
[13:34:09] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, sure. But up until now, I honestly didn't realize that the jqueyr object didn't remove the element when the element was removed from the dom. It's just a lot to rethink.
[13:34:36] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: are you calling .remove() yourself
[13:34:44] <c0d3Rg1rl> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/HnwVR/3/
[13:34:58] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: jQuery is designed so that it plays nice with normal DOM mutations. If you went and did an explicit .removeChild on an element, jQuery would have no way of knowing you did that
[13:35:10] <c0d3Rg1rl> rabbi1: you did not replace "from" with "startdate" when copying the example from http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#date-range
[13:35:11] <johnkpaul> it would actually be interesting to make a jquery extension that keeps track of what has been removed, and all of the jquery objects in memory and update them if needed
[13:35:19] <johnkpaul> although that would be hell for memory and the garbage colector
[13:35:31] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: oops, sorry
[13:35:49] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, I am just realizing the importance of that detail. It's common sense, but I just logged my false belief under "jquery magic" and went with it. LOL
[13:35:53] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: the other from, din't catch my eye at all, shit :(
[13:36:20] <rabbi1> :'(
[13:36:20] <Whirl3d> jonkpaul, or even a subset of them would be great
[13:36:35] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: There is no such thing as magic, if you can't do something in JavaScript, jQuery can't do it
[13:36:38] <Eviltwin> Always remember that
[13:36:39] <c0d3Rg1rl> rabbi1: that's why copy&paste is bad and trying to understand the code is good... there was even "this.id == ..."
[13:36:42] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: thanks a lot, guess i am totally out of energy, got to have a sleep
[13:36:49] <c0d3Rg1rl> np
[13:37:24] <Whirl3d> Trust. I prefer to think of "jquery magic" as the stuff that is included in "not reinventing the wheel" I know how a tire works, but not really.
[13:38:14] <Whirl3d> And it's not that I c an't learn the details of what makes a wheel (or a tire) work, it's just that it takes more time than I have when I got to get home now...
[13:38:16] <Whirl3d> lol
[13:39:10] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: thanks, its 2:00 AM here ;) eyes are dead. good i made this mistake, just found out the mistake, can be useful :)
[13:39:32] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: If jQuery is solving a problem you don't know how to solve in JavaScript, you should figure out what would be required to solve it in JavaScript
[13:40:15] <Whirl3d> So, you walk everywhere, right?
[13:40:38] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: one more thing, i don understand why the calendar load takes lot of time
[13:40:39] <Whirl3d> Because otherwise, you should learn how a catalytic converter works before you go somewhere in a car?
[13:40:54] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, that's not reasonable. That's why we have jquery...
[13:40:57] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: anyway, will check that out later. thx, good night
[13:41:00] <c0d3Rg1rl> rabbi1: jquery UI takes some time to load all the css-images
[13:41:12] <Whirl3d> to do the things that would take more time to learn than the rewards it would offer
[13:41:54] <rabbi1> c0d3Rg1rl: oops, then better to change the .css ..... no need for background images, instead will use colors, more than enough... ;) take care !
[13:42:26] <Whirl3d> I am fortunate to be able to leverage the vast knowledge of a team of experts that wrote jquery. The notion that I should be able to do it in javascript  without jquery seems foreign to me
[13:42:55] <Whirl3d> (though I would love to be able to, mind you)
[13:43:15] <_eagspoo> $.post('/hardware', {driver: 25, passenger: 20})  Why whenever I do this do I see a get, not a post in chrome inspector web console?
[13:45:06] <jita> How can i do this? .children.hasClass("cell-inactive")) ?
[13:45:18] <jita> i want to perform if condition
[13:45:34] <jita> if any of the child of currently selected division has a class of foo
[13:45:44] <jita> execute the function
[13:45:45] <c0d3Rg1rl> _eagspoo: get a POST here
[13:46:08] <_eagspoo> $.post('/hardware', {driver: 25, passenger: 20})  In chrome this gives me a get, but in FF it works fine and does the post.  anyone know what the problem with chrome is?
[13:46:17] <_eagspoo> Yeah I only have that on chrome
[13:46:21] <c0d3Rg1rl> _eagspoo: get a POST here with chrome
[13:46:41] <_eagspoo> seems like a bug somewhere, maybe chrome but that would be a big bug if ajax posts were automatically converted to gets
[13:46:48] <_eagspoo> maybe it is my version
[13:47:42] <_eagspoo> jita: .children.is(".cell-inactive')
[13:48:16] * Whirl3d kicks dirt...
[13:48:17] <c0d3Rg1rl> _eagspoo: watch the network-tab in chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/XARXj/
[13:48:29] <_eagspoo> Yes I am doing that.  It is saying it is a GET
[13:48:38] <_eagspoo> my chrome version btw: Version 19.0.1055.1 dev Get Help With Using Chrome
[13:48:48] <c0d3Rg1rl> with my jsfiddle?
[13:48:58] <Whirl3d> I hope I didn't offend, Eviltwin, I was expecting your normal lively banter... either you are busy or I am wearing you out. sorry if its the latter.
[13:49:36] <Vainoharhainen> Is .on the same thing as .live?
[13:49:42] <c0d3Rg1rl> _eagspoo: with Chrome "17.0.963.79 m" and http://jsfiddle.net/XARXj/ I see a POST
[13:50:22] <kaldari> anyone know what the deal is with dev.jquery.com. It's been down at least since last week.
[13:51:23] <kaldari> I tried reporting a jQuery bug in the forums instead, but no one ever responded.
[13:51:38] <_eagspoo> yeah that works for me too actually.  maybe it is my jquery version
[13:52:43] <ajpiano> kaldari: it's http://bugs.jquery.com
[13:53:12] <kaldari> cool, thank you!
[13:55:32] <kaldari> ajpiane: I tried creating a new bug ticket and it just gives me an error: 'The page you are looking for is temporarily unavailable.
[13:55:33] <kaldari> Please try again later.'
[13:55:43] <kaldari> ajpiano: ^
[13:56:16] <ajpiano> yeah, we are in the middle of getting through some troubles over there
[13:56:28] <kaldari> no problem, I'll try again later :)
[13:56:33] <ajpiano> thanks
[13:56:34] <ajpiano> what's the bug
[13:56:38] <ajpiano> "bug" ?
[13:56:43] <kaldari> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/bug-with-getwh
[13:57:01] <kaldari> I'm a software dev for Wikipedia
[13:57:14] <kaldari> and I noticed this was causing problems with some of our textarea inputs
[13:57:17] <Whirl3d> having outstayed my welcome, I take my leave. Thanks for all the great information and help.
[13:57:37] <scar2> how can i tell where the code is that operates a form on a site?
[13:57:42] <scar2> is there some google chrome dev tool, etc?
[13:58:22] <ajpiano> kaldari: are you sure it still happens on the latest jquery git version?
[13:58:25] <ajpiano> you can test in jsfiddle
[13:58:29] <ajpiano> kaldari: according to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10669 it's fixed
[13:58:39] <kaldari> no, haven't tested on the trunk version
[13:58:52] <kaldari> oh, that's cool
[13:58:54] <ajpiano> oh wait, that's animate not getWH but i would imagine they might be related
[13:59:56] <kaldari> ajpiano: I'm not sure it's the same bug though, as 10669 says it was introduced after 1.6.4, but my bug was introduced in 1.6.2.
[14:00:10] <ajpiano> yeah i'm not sure, i think i might be wrong
[14:00:24] <ajpiano> kaldari: point is either way, you'll need a fiddle to demonstrate on the bug tracker when it's finally post able :)
[14:00:49] <kaldari> ok
[14:11:05] <ccmonster> quick question guys
[14:11:21] <ccmonster> parseInt(form.cntA.text()) to get the number, whats a good method of incrementing like that?
[14:11:52] <ccmonster> is it always multi lined, or are there some efficient ways of selecting, incrementing, and overwriting the text of the selected, efficienttly.
[14:12:17] <majicpanda>  <a id='foo' href='#'>Change Me</a>   ... $("foo").?.html("New Text");  anyone know if this is easily supported?
[14:12:45] <ccmonster> .? whats that
[14:13:22] <majicpanda> just wanting to know what the syntax is to change html of an href
[14:13:42] <ccmonster> $('#foo').prop('href','new value')
[14:13:54] <majicpanda> not the link but the text?
[14:14:21] <majicpanda> css 2 compat preferably
[14:14:34] <ccmonster> oh
[14:14:37] <ccmonster> change the prop
[14:14:48] <c0d3Rg1rl> majicpanda: $("#foo").text("New Text");
[14:14:58] <ccmonster> $('#foo').prop('text','new value')
[14:15:20] <ccmonster> or $('#foo',{text:'new Text'}) even works I believe
[14:15:21] <majicpanda> either of those more browser friendly than the other?
[14:15:40] <majicpanda> thanks
[14:15:45] <c0d3Rg1rl> they basically do the same.
[14:15:59] <ccmonster> i'd lean towards the prop, but that's me.
[14:16:16] <majicpanda> theres a pissing contest in #css and no one would answer any questions, lol
[14:16:40] <DerekPioneer> i have an encoded url but ajax() seems to only want to send part of it.http://jsfiddle.net/89qUK/1/
[14:16:40] <ccmonster> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874652/prop-vs-attr
[14:16:45] <DerekPioneer> sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/89qUK/1/
[14:17:32] <majicpanda> DerekPioneer: i dont belive you can use returns in js
[14:17:43] <majicpanda> need to be 1 long string
[14:17:53] <majicpanda> seems you may have hit enter to break it up.. at a first glance
[14:18:11] <DerekPioneer> i don't think i did
[14:18:21] <DerekPioneer> majicpanda: i think the jsfiddle is just making it look liek that
[14:18:23] <majicpanda> may be how it pasted
[14:19:05] <DerekPioneer> it's because portions of the url are uriencoded
[14:19:10] <majicpanda> where does it cut off
[14:19:20] <DerekPioneer> http://s7d7.scene7.com/is/agm/pioneercolor/MS451?fmt=jpg
[14:19:21] <ccmonster> um, when i do a console.log (saveFxg.scene7.magnetUrl) it shows the whole thing.
[14:19:26] <DerekPioneer> it cuts off &page=1
[14:19:37] <DerekPioneer> yeah it's like it can't $_POST it
[14:19:41] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/89qUK/2/
[14:21:25] <DerekPioneer> ccmonster: javascript recognizes it fine, but when i use ajax() to $_POST it
[14:21:31] <DerekPioneer> it cuts off everything after ?fmt=jpg
[14:21:35] <DerekPioneer> ?fmt=jpg&page=1
[14:21:37] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, Couldn't find "fmt=jpg&page=1" in jQuery Docs.
[14:21:49] <DerekPioneer> it would turn that into ?fmt=jpg
[14:22:06] <ccmonster> urldecode, then the ajax should re-encode it
[14:23:42] <DerekPioneer> ccmonster: still cuts everything out
[14:24:19] <DerekPioneer> is it because ajax() isn't confused about 'url=' + saveFxg.scene7.magnetUrl,
[14:24:32] <DerekPioneer> like when it sees '&'s inside of magnetUrl, it thinks that's another post parameter?
[14:29:05] <DerekPioneer> got it, just needed to put the post parameter inside data: { url : magnetUrl }, instead of data: 'url=' + magnetUrl
[14:29:58] <c0d3Rg1rl> then it was an encoding-poblem.
[14:31:13] <DerekPioneer> c0d3Rg1rl: this is a weird url, parts of it need to be encoded and parts of it don't for it to work correctly
[14:32:46] <majicpanda> <a id="navHP" href="#" class="buttonLink">5<img src='images/health.png'></a>  <- neither versions of that .text appear to work with this
[14:33:13] <c0d3Rg1rl> yes, but jquery encodes the necessary parts before sending to server if you use {url:..} instead of passing a string for 'data'
[14:33:52] <c0d3Rg1rl> majicpanda: there is an img within the <a></a>...
[14:34:01] <c0d3Rg1rl> wasn't there when you asked.
[14:34:37] <majicpanda> its still text no
[14:34:44] <majicpanda> doesnt matter whats inside
[14:35:01] <majicpanda> a character is a character? ;)
[14:37:00] <c0d3Rg1rl> .text() overwrites all between <a .. > and </a>
[14:37:03] <majicpanda> $("a#navHP").text(data.hp); works
[14:37:10] <majicpanda> needed the a before #
[14:37:25] <majicpanda> yea thats fine, i can re-add the image
[14:37:38] <systemhawk> hi guys... i am using 'jquery on' ... i have 2 different .on events for the same object.... how do i 'allow bubbling up' or make sure it bubbles up... i am not returning false or stopping the event but the second .on which is bound to $(document).on never executes :(
[14:37:46] <majicpanda> i cant put any span's or anything in there, it messes up all the css
[14:37:56] <majicpanda> thanks, was 99% there
[14:39:08] <c0d3Rg1rl> well, use .html() then... gone he is
[14:39:38] <majicpanda> ok so .text literally does .text
[14:39:46] <panda> hi guys
[14:39:53] <c0d3Rg1rl> majicpanda: well, use .html() then... gone he is
[14:39:57] <majicpanda> $("a#navHP").text(data.hp+"<img src='images/health.png'>"); puts string or string
[14:40:01] <Guest75379> is there a way i can make text in between <img></img> clickable
[14:40:08] <majicpanda> ok ill try html
[14:40:13] <Guest75379> and not just the image itself
[14:40:15] <Zzaichik> what the fuck
[14:40:47] <Guest75379> I have a code <img>Click Me</img>
[14:40:59] <Guest75379> is there a way to make Click Me clickable and not just the image itself
[14:40:59] <c0d3Rg1rl> Guest75379: <a href="whatever"><img src="img.gif" />Text</a>
[14:41:01] <Zzaichik> Guest75379: That's not even valid HTML
[14:41:18] <Guest75379> hang on
[14:41:22] <Guest75379> let me get the code for you
[14:41:30] <majicpanda> works
[14:41:31] <Guest75379> $("#results").delegate("li", "click", function(){
[14:41:34] <majicpanda> thanks
[14:41:37] <Guest75379> $("#results").delegate("img", "click", function(){
[14:41:51] <systemhawk> i want to allow event bubbling up to another .on listener but its not happening
[14:41:52] <majicpanda> dunno why i didnt just use .html, was trying to do too much at once and simplified it
[14:41:56] <Guest75379> and my html code under the results div is
[14:41:58] <seyfarth> newbie question: there a way I can make a javascript file require jquery be loaded before it?
[14:42:00] <systemhawk> i have 1 div and 2 ons in different .js files
[14:42:02] <majicpanda> ok this flood is lagging, tie to go home
[14:42:24] <Guest75379> how do i make the text in between img clickable?
[14:42:40] <Guest75379> with my delegate function
[14:43:10] <Guest75379> my delegate binds to an img
[14:44:28] <Zzaichik> Someone beat DeLorean731

[14:51:03] <zatan> Hi can anyone help me with Jquery UI dialog, how can I add css to dialog ? http://jsfiddle.net/jPhWG/

[14:55:19] <zatan> gnarf, nerver mind i have added jquery-ui.css
[14:57:41] <chovy> seyfarth: $(function(){ //jquery is loaded here });
[14:58:09] <chovy> seyfarth: that's a short cut for onDomReady
[15:40:36] <Emn1ty> is there a way to make it so the page behind fancybox doesn't scroll when you hit the bottom of a scrollable window in the fancybox?
[15:47:31] <Zzaichik> you could…   check if the overlay is :visible and set the overflow to hidden or something like that.
[15:47:49] <Zzaichik> or the fancybox
[15:48:59] <Emn1ty> thats what I was thinking
[15:49:01] <Emn1ty> thanks

[16:47:31] <Blaster> nvm
[16:47:34] <Blaster> :eq(i)
[16:52:13] <Blaster> how come it seems I can't use eq when it's just one element?
[16:52:35] <Blaster> nvm
[16:52:52] <yedimind> why would you need to use eq if its just one element?
[16:53:49] <Blaster> building a slideshow in which the slides are added dynamically, so sometimes it's just one slide
[16:54:02] <Blaster> though in that case I think the slideshow should be halted ;)
[17:01:44] <Blaster> any tips on how to pause a slideshow?  I'm using setTimeout in a function and recursively calling it to go to nextSlide();
[17:06:16] <johnkpaul> Blaster: the return value from setTimeout can be passed to clearTimeout
[17:06:42] <Blaster> interesting
[17:07:07] * muzone is now playing: Muzone - Dying Old Man Watching Sunset (http://home.no/reddvinylene/dying_old_man_watching_sunset.mp3)
[17:08:34] <youngin_> muzone: nice
[17:08:46] <youngin_> quite different from that coldhead song though
[17:11:37] <someprimetime> say i have 3 separate objects all with the same name, how can i count how many are there? e.g. 3
[17:11:52] <muzone> youngin_: hehe yeah
[17:11:57] <Blaster> you can count the number of elements matched by your selector with .length
[17:13:11] <yedimind> someprimetime, by name, what do you mean?
[17:13:14] <someprimetime> i want to count how many instances there are of the object
[17:13:23] <yedimind> $('element').length
[17:13:40] <yedimind> will telly ou how many objects, but im hoping that you're not talking about a scenario where you have multiple objects with the same D
[17:13:43] <yedimind> ID*
[17:13:44] <someprimetime> there are always X number of cloned file objects on the page… so if i do obj.length i get the number of properties
[17:13:50] <someprimetime> not the total number of objects
[17:13:59] <yedimind> no you get the number of objects...
[17:14:08] <someprimetime> you sur?
[17:14:10] <someprimetime> sure*
[17:14:22] <aghouseh> does anyone know if its possible to disable certain scripts from loading via firebug?
[17:14:24] <yedimind> yes, thats what length does
[17:14:46] <yedimind> i mean, if you clone them it'll count that too, but at that point you have those elments
[17:14:59] <yedimind> what you can do, is store the length value on document.ready to ignore the cloned objects moving forward
[17:15:17] <yedimind> var number $(document).ready(function() { var number = $(object).length }
[17:15:23] <yedimind> err second var is not needed my bad
[17:17:28] <someprimetime> i keep getting undefined
[17:17:36] <someprimetime> for obj.length
[17:17:51] <someprimetime> but if i console.log(obj) it definitely exists and has properties
[17:18:45] <yedimind> $(obj).length
[17:19:23] <yedimind> or $(selector).length specifically
[17:20:27] <someprimetime> oh nice that did it thanks
[17:20:51] <someprimetime> hm so if i have 3 objects it'll output: 1 1 1.. anyway to combine the three of these at once?
[17:21:05] <someprimetime> like loop through them and push the total value to an array?
[17:21:15] <someprimetime> or push each of them to an array and output the length of the array after?
[17:41:35] <habahaba> hello. if i handle the input from a form with jquery can i still save it to a database?
[17:59:55] <Blaster> how would you select all elements except eq(1) ?
[18:00:23] <imsky> $("el:not(:eq(1))")
[18:00:24] <bot-t> (20 hours 50 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky no im just...busy
[18:46:51] <eddiemonge> $(elements).not(":eq(1)")
[18:52:13] <min|dvir|us1> What is the best way to create methods?
[18:57:31] <eddiemonge> thats a vague question
[18:57:54] <tw2113> be method man?
[19:02:37] <xp_prg> hi all I want to find a td with the value True inside of it
[19:02:42] <xp_prg> what is the selector to do that?
[19:02:48] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: value? you mean text?
[19:02:52] <xp_prg> ya
[19:03:15] <xp_prg> I have this so far $("table#mytableid tr:nth-of-type(odd)").find('td');
[19:03:23] <eddiemonge> ?contains @ xp_prg
[19:03:23] <bot-t> xp_prg, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[19:03:53] <xp_prg> I don't know how to use contains with my current selector :(
[19:04:00] <xp_prg> also contains was removed from css3 ;(
[19:04:17] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: that has nothing to do with jquery
[19:04:56] <eddiemonge> $("#mytableid.find("tr:odd").find('td:contains("True")');
[19:05:06] <xp_prg> it does if your trying to standardize on your selector in jquery using css3 sytnax
[19:05:48] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: jQuery is JavaScript. JavaScript is not CSS
[19:06:34] <xp_prg> eddiemonge but how do I set the css background-color for the row containing that td?
[19:06:45] <xp_prg> would it be .parent().css ?
[19:06:59] <eddiemonge> yes
[19:07:27] <Faryshta> xp_prg, http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[19:07:45] <xp_prg> I heart you in ways you can't fully understand right now
[19:08:00] <Blaster> how crappy is easing in IE 6-7?
[19:08:08] <Faryshta> xp_prg, $('li.item-a').parent().css('background-color', 'red');
[19:08:28] <eddiemonge> Faryshta:  i think you joined the convo a bit late
[19:08:29] <xp_prg> right I got it to work, I just wish I could do the whole thing in one selector instead of using find
[19:08:41] <Faryshta> eddiemonge, well I tried :)
[19:09:01] <xp_prg> $("table#data tr:nth-of-type(even)").find("td:contains('True')").parent().css('background-color', 'blue');
[19:09:02] <RORgasm> hey guys
[19:09:04] <RORgasm> banging my head a bit
[19:09:06] <RORgasm> trying to create a github public gist via a simple jquery post api call
[19:09:10] <RORgasm> has anyone doe this?
[19:09:17] <xp_prg> is it possible to put it all in one selector?
[19:09:31] <eddiemonge> ?sop @ RORgasm
[19:09:31] <bot-t> RORgasm, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[19:10:48] <RORgasm> eddiemonge: so does that mean it can't be done?
[19:11:04] <RORgasm> i'm just curious how other gist client libraries are able to do it
[19:11:13] <RORgasm> and apparently u can curl and do it
[19:12:09] <xp_prg> why doesn't this work: $("table#tbl_data tr:nth-of-type(even) td:contains('True')");
[19:12:16] <RORgasm> eddiemonge:  that link is broken
[19:12:24] <eddiemonge> RORgasm: have you looked at githubs api?
[19:12:32] <RORgasm> i have
[19:12:38] <eddiemonge> ?even @ xp_prg
[19:12:38] <RORgasm> it looks straightforward
[19:12:38] <bot-t> xp_prg, :even: Selects even elements, zero-indexed. See also odd. http://api.jquery.com/even-selector/
[19:12:44] <RORgasm> this is what i've tried
[19:13:07] <xp_prg> eddiemonge how does that answer my question?
[19:13:19] <xp_prg> can I use contains in the selector in any way just curious?
[19:13:23] <RORgasm> http://pastie.org/3598005
[19:13:29] <RORgasm> eddiemonge: ^
[19:13:46] <RORgasm> and it seems to make sense according to their api
[19:14:12] <RORgasm> but it goes to the failure callback with just the html results from gist.github.com
[19:14:16] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: you dont need to do nth-of-type(even)
[19:14:33] <xp_prg> I only want to effect even rows
[19:14:40] <xp_prg> that have True in one of the td columns
[19:14:44] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: did you see what even does?
[19:14:51] <xp_prg> ya
[19:15:02] <xp_prg> but I am trying to use css3 syntax
[19:15:11] <Faryshta> xp_prg, I just did a test. It worked for me on jq1.7.1
[19:15:18] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: why?
[19:15:25] <xp_prg> so I don't have to learn two ways to do things
[19:15:29] <xp_prg> just standardize on css3
[19:15:41] <xp_prg> that way I can switch to jquery and css3 very easily
[19:16:15] <eddiemonge> RORgasm: put your code here: http://jsfiddle.net/fcHPN/
[19:16:37] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: but again, JavaScript is not CSS3.
[19:16:57] <xp_prg> ya but you can use css3 selectors in jquery
[19:17:01] <xp_prg> what is wrong with that?
[19:17:48] <Faryshta> xp_prg, nothing wrong perse its just that sometimes it wont work.
[19:18:04] <xp_prg> ya that is my strategy :>
[19:18:21] <xp_prg> my brain can only hold so much information inside of it
[19:18:32] <RORgasm> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/harisamin/fcHPN/1/
[19:19:00] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: you arent using CSS3 selectors in jQuery. You are using selectors that just happen to match some selectors that are in use by CSS(3)
[19:19:15] <xp_prg> jquery supports css3 selectors does it not?
[19:19:22] <xp_prg> that is what I am trying to do even if I am not doing it :(
[19:20:15] <xp_prg> by the way can I use live on that?
[19:20:21] <xp_prg> or is that liveQuery?
[19:20:21] <RORgasm> eddiemonge:  any ideas?
[19:20:36] <eddiemonge> RORgasm: again you need to look at github's api: http://develop.github.com/p/gist.html
[19:21:01] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: live is deprecated. dont use it. see ? on delegation
[19:21:01] <bot-t> xp_prg, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:21:15] <Faryshta> xp_prg, supported selectors http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[19:21:40] <RORgasm> eddiemonge: i was following what's described here http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/
[19:21:50] <RORgasm> but let me try to see if the old api works
[19:22:17] <xp_prg> can I use on, on a selector instead of an event?
[19:23:18] <xp_prg> well, I could bind to the change event
[19:23:20] <RORgasm> eddiemonge: that v1 api doesn't have any docs for a post/create call
[19:25:36] <eddiemonge> RORgasm: but its missing the authentication part
[19:26:09] <RORgasm> eddiemonge: i didn't think that was necessary unless you needed to create private gists
[19:27:25] <xp_prg> forgive me stupdity, how do I bind an event to a table if any rows are added?
[19:27:26] <eddiemonge> RORgasm: how does it know how to associate the gist with?
[19:27:43] <RORgasm> i'm not trying to associate the gist with anyone
[19:27:46] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: you mean call a function when rows are added to a table?
[19:27:53] <eddiemonge> RORgasm: they have to be i think
[19:27:59] <RORgasm> if u go to gist.github.com and u are not signed it, you can just create a gist anonymously
[19:28:03] <RORgasm> eddiemonge:  hmmm
[19:28:54] <xp_prg> ya
[19:29:17] <eddiemonge> RORgasm: its failing because the response isnt jsonp
[19:29:29] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: like that, call a function after you add the row
[19:29:46] <xp_prg> ok, just wondering if there was a cooler way to do it is all :>
[19:29:55] <RORgasm> eddiemonge:  right...i guess i'm just lost wiht github's api at this point to create an anonymous gist
[19:33:09] <acidjazz> any1 have any experience w/ character encoding
[19:33:23] <acidjazz> chars like 1/2 and 1/3 and (r) not showing up properly
[20:06:39] <Blaster> what would this || do guys? var sec = $('#hideMsg span').text() || 0;
[20:07:17] <ezosk> Is that a valid selector?
[20:07:57] <RandalSchwartz> blaster seriously?
[20:08:07] <RandalSchwartz> never seen "or" before?
[20:08:51] <Blaster> Of course I have, just never in a variable declaration.
[20:09:06] <RandalSchwartz> works the same there as anywhere else. :)
[20:09:24] <RandalSchwartz> returns the left thing if it's true, otherwise the right thing
[20:10:09] <Blaster> kk
[20:32:07] <here4thegear> I'm lost.
[20:33:12] <here4thegear> http://www.cinsay.com/products/ firebug tells me "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://www.cinsay.com/wp-content/themes/hostme/jquery-accordion/jquery.ui.base.css" but I can't even find jquery.ui.base.css as part of the source for this page
[20:42:59] <Gonad> hey
[20:43:06] <Gonad> I have a bunch of divs
[20:43:16] <Gonad> lets say 10 of them
[20:43:28] <Gonad> one of the divs (say the 3rd one) has a class calld tc that the others don't have
[20:43:42] <Gonad> what i need to find is the next sibling right after the tc one
[20:44:15] <VioByte> here4thegear: view-source:http://www.cinsay.com/products/ line 99
[20:44:24] <Gonad> $("div.tc:next")
[20:44:27] <kborchers> ?next @ Gonad
[20:44:28] <bot-t> Gonad, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[20:44:28] <Gonad> someting like that but its not getting it
[20:44:54] <kborchers> $(".tc").next()
[20:45:06] <Gonad> no dice
[20:45:21] <Gonad> lemme set up a jsfiddle
[20:47:08] <Gonad> hrm
[20:47:13] <Gonad> i msut be doing somethin eird
[20:47:15] <Gonad> works in jsf
[20:47:24] <VioByte> or something is conflicting
[20:48:12] <Gonad> ya
[20:48:55] <cpaq> I have a form that has a couple inputs, and a button element, when I click the button the form submits, but i don't want it to submit, cause I just want to trigger a jquery function, the trigger part is no problem with .click, but the form submitting is a problem, has the page reloads and scrolls to the top of the page.  Now I could just get rid of the form, except I am using the form validate() plugin, so I want to keep the form
[20:48:59] <VioByte> You know you use the nano editor to much when you hit ctrl+o while in other editors. lol
[20:49:21] <Gonad> oh
[20:49:26] <Gonad> i think its getting the div immedialy after
[20:49:29] <Gonad> and mine's nested
[20:49:43] <cpaq> I get confused with emacs, hitting control-Y instead of V
[20:49:49] <kborchers> ?preventDefault @ cpaq
[20:49:50] <bot-t> cpaq, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[20:50:04] <cpaq> kborchers, thx
[20:50:12] <Gonad> $(".tc").parent().next().children("img");
[20:50:17] <Gonad> is there a shorter way of doing that? :p
[20:50:24] <kborchers> cpaq: and bind to the submit event instead of click
[20:51:24] <cpaq> kborchers, how would I do that, I just have a <button id='meid'>enter</button>
[20:54:22] <cpaq> kborchers, Oh, got it, thx
[20:54:32] <kborchers> :)
[20:57:31] <VioByte> arg. i hate when i confuse css with an html tags.  ex: <div id="#mydiv"></div>
[21:02:08] <cpaq> http://jsfiddle.net/8HezB/  I am using the validate() plugin and I have a submit() call back function, so, I wonder how to make my submit() and its call back a call back to validate
[21:02:13] * tw2113 hates that too VioByte 
[21:03:14] <cpaq> I hate no knowing when you can/can't chain methods
[21:04:52] <cpaq> I guess it save to assume to can't chain onto plugins eh
[21:05:28] <here4thegear> VioByte: so that js file is forcing those css files?
[21:05:55] <ngharo> cpaq: plugins _should_ always return $(this)
[21:05:59] <ngharo> i believe
[21:06:48] <cpaq>  $("#SavingsCalculation").validate().submit(function() {event.preventDefault();}); doesn't work
[21:15:13] <VioByte> here4thegear: maybe. I've done somthing like that before.
[21:15:20] <here4thegear> I got it... jquery.ui.all.css does @import for the other ui files... we aren't even using those themes... cleaning up other people's mess is fun :-)
[21:15:41] <VioByte> as always.. lol
[21:16:04] <VioByte> its even better when you get paid to clean up after people.
[21:16:09] <VioByte> depending on the mess vs the cost
[21:17:33] <VioByte> Me being bored = http://jsfiddle.net/UNy28/1/
[21:17:35] <VioByte> lol
[21:18:25] <here4thegear> Yep, getting paid for this one so so actually yeah, it's fun :-)
[21:19:01] <here4thegear> mostly because finding other folks mistakes lets you know where not to make one yourself in the future... IF I can remember it :-)
[21:19:42] <VioByte> The only problem i have with doing client work is that i tend to go off the planned path and add funcionality here and there that was never requested but is useful for the current task
[21:19:49] <VioByte> i hate when i do that
[21:20:16] <here4thegear> hah.. I do that far less than I used to but am still a bit guilty of it.
[21:20:27] <VioByte> but that show i went a bit above and beyond to make the project better.
[21:20:30] <VioByte> shows*
[21:20:53] <VioByte> usually that = repeat customers.
[21:21:15] <VioByte> so,.. its not that bad.
[21:21:35] <here4thegear> very true! The folks at this place are great too. I've had some crazy customers before... This is a nice change ;-)
[21:24:54] <VioByte> Ugh... I goto facebook to "Like" jsfiddle and what do I see?  Facebooks retarded timeline crap.
[21:24:59] <VioByte> *sigh*
[21:27:40] <Dark_Wolf> Hey everyone.
[21:29:15] <here4thegear> I know.. the timeline is going to be forced for pages on the 30th (supposedly)... The problem is, now it takes up to 45 minutes sometimes for a post to appear so sometimes I end up posting the same thing 2 or 3 times
[21:29:24] <Dark_Wolf> I seem to be having trouble getting errors to be caught with an AJAX request. I disconnect the computer from the internet, it tries to load the data, and it just hangs.
[21:29:30] <here4thegear> and facebook's rss feed isn't instant which royally screws me up.
[21:29:32] <Dark_Wolf> here4thegear: I haven't seen that issue with Timeline for Pages yet.
[21:30:02] <Dark_Wolf> I'm using jQuery 1.5.1, by the way
[21:30:19] <VioByte> here4thegear: well Google+ is no better So yea i'm done with the Social Hype since its getting WAY out of hand.
[21:30:46] <here4thegear> Dark_Wolf: I've had that issue with ajax as well. Thought it might be browser bug issues...
[21:30:51] <VioByte> twitter i would keep tho. mainly for company up to the minute notices.
[21:31:13] <Dark_Wolf> http://pastebin.com/zbYMuSm6
[21:31:21] <here4thegear> VioByte: yeah, love twitter
[21:31:22] <Dark_Wolf> This is the code I'm trying. error is never triggering.
[21:33:33] <Dark_Wolf> I'll try updating to 1.7.1, just for kicks
[21:33:44] <Dark_Wolf> Alright, seems that updating to 1.7.1 fixed it
[21:34:15] <VioByte> yea 1.5 is pretty buggy
[21:34:33] <here4thegear> Dark_Wolf: try error: function(jqXHR, exception) {alert(jqXHR.status}
[21:34:55] <Dark_Wolf> here4thegear: Already fixed, but thanks
[21:35:26] <here4thegear> Dark_Wolf: what? all I did was blink... that was fast lol
[21:35:40] <Dark_Wolf> here4thegear: Seems 1.5.1 is bugged, so 1.7.1 fixed it
[21:36:36] <VioByte> here4thegear: the power of blinking :)
[21:36:40] <VioByte> lol
[21:36:53] <here4thegear> heheh
[21:37:13] <here4thegear> was that a Charmed reference?
[21:39:04] <VioByte> Charmed?
[21:39:55] <here4thegear> guess not... lol.. was a show in the 90's
[21:40:07] <here4thegear> blinking is a warlock power ;-)
[21:40:18] <VioByte> ok... anyways... back to the coding board.
[21:43:25] <Dark_Wolf> Thanks guys ^.^
[21:51:29] <LukeNukem> Hello, my onsubmit is not working for some reason, can someone help me out?
[21:55:21] <VioByte> LukeNukem: slap it on jsfiddle.net and paste the link here and someone will eventually look into it. I would but pretty busy atm.
[21:55:50] <LukeNukem> VioByte, im trying to jsfiddle, but then all my js is not working for some reason
[21:56:05] <LukeNukem> Framework : Jquery 1.7.1, onDomReady
[21:59:11] <LukeNukem> does $(this).on"submit" work like .submit?
[22:07:36] <Time2303> noo jsfiddle.net.
[22:10:37] <LukeNukem> Please someone help me out :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9714319/on-submit-event-handler-not-working-with-hidden-button
[22:10:47] <Cork> LukeNukem: there is no onsubmit in jquery
[22:13:14] <Cork> LukeNukem: uh.. you bind the submit handler on keyup???
[22:13:22] <LukeNukem> Cork, yea
[22:13:35] <Cork> where do you unbind it?
[22:13:49] <LukeNukem> Cork, im talking about $("#something").on("submit", function()...
[22:13:57] <LukeNukem> Cork, what do you mean i have to unbind it
[22:14:01] <LukeNukem> im binding a different form to keyup
[22:14:44] <Cork> ya, but each time anyone press a key in #status_update you bind a new listner to url_parser
[22:14:54] <LukeNukem> oh
[22:14:55] <LukeNukem> :\
[22:15:05] <LukeNukem> i wanted this for realtimeness, how can i do it any other way like facebook does it?
[22:15:11] <LukeNukem> im trying to grab data from an external page
[22:15:14] <Cork> you'll end up with 10'th of listner for a few chars
[22:15:33] <Cork> what is it you want?
[22:15:36] <Cork> autocomplete?
[22:15:45] <Cork> search as you type?
[22:16:12] <LukeNukem> no no no
[22:16:15] <LukeNukem> one second
[22:16:29] <LukeNukem> if it were autocomplete i would use jquery ui
[22:17:10] <LukeNukem> Cork, this is what im trying to do http://i.imgur.com/rN1J5.png
[22:17:33] <Cork> ok, so you want to do ajax on keypress?
[22:17:39] <Cork> sorry keyup
[22:17:40] <LukeNukem> yes
[22:17:51] <LukeNukem> how about i make the keyup handler send a value to the hidden field
[22:17:51] <Cork> why are you adding submit listners then?
[22:18:01] <LukeNukem> um
[22:18:03] <Cork> just do the ajax call
[22:18:17] <LukeNukem> the php script needs a link to fetch the data from right
[22:18:19] <LukeNukem> and i need to pass the url to it
[22:18:23] <LukeNukem> the hidden field contains the url
[22:18:27] <Cork> so?
[22:18:43] <LukeNukem> i give the hidden field the url and then i do a post request so the php script gets the link
[22:18:54] <Cork> data: $("form[name='url_parser']").serialize()
[22:19:04] <LukeNukem> what about t
[22:19:06] <LukeNukem> it*
[22:19:15] <Cork> you want to send the form
[22:19:22] <Cork> that has nothing to do with submit listners
[22:19:23] <LukeNukem> yup
[22:19:29] <LukeNukem> ok
[22:19:34] <Cork> just serialize the form and send it on keyup
[22:20:09] <LukeNukem> how do i give it the url?
[22:20:12] <LukeNukem> the php script
[22:20:43] <Cork> uh... the ajax call?
[22:20:45] <LukeNukem> Cork, how about this, on the keyup event i check if the input field hidden is empty, if empty give it the url if not empty elave it as it is
[22:21:00] <LukeNukem> and then outside the keyup handler, if its not empty then do the ajax call
[22:23:08] <Cork> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/pPCKm/
[22:28:14] <someprimetime> so i've got two of the exact same objects on the page, and when i do a console.log($(obj.file).length); it prints 1 twice
[22:28:37] <someprimetime> how should i combine these? just have a counter and += 1?
[22:28:48] <LukeNukem> Cork, oh i also got this issue where the form submits 3-7 times
[22:29:33] <Cork> LukeNukem: sure you get one for each keyup
[22:29:46] <LukeNukem> Cork, yep :) but i want it to do that only if there is a url
[22:30:12] <Cork> LukeNukem: you need to use a timer to delay the search, cancel timer when the user types
[22:30:25] <Cork> that way it only searches when the user stops typing
[22:30:31] <LukeNukem> Cork, how about i just check if the input field is empty?
[22:30:46] <Cork> LukeNukem: that won't help
[22:31:01] <Cork> someprimetime: combine what?
[22:31:08] <LukeNukem> well i want only urls to go and thats why i use the hidden field
[22:31:09] <LukeNukem> know what i mean
[22:31:31] <Cork> LukeNukem: to be honest not at all
[22:32:04] <Cork> LukeNukem: i think you give a lot of automatic features to the dom it doesn't have
[22:32:04] <VioByte> but then you have the problem with the user stopping in the middle of typing. Then again its not that bad of a solution.
[22:32:33] <Cork> VioByte: there isn't really any way around that if you want auto preview
[22:32:40] <VioByte> yep
[22:32:47] <Cork> only thing you can do is validate the url so its valid
[22:33:49] <Cork> LukeNukem: from what you explain i wouldn't involve a form at all
[22:34:10] <Cork> it gives absolutly nothing to what you want to do
[22:34:26] <LukeNukem> ok
[22:34:39] <LukeNukem> getting rid of form, so get request to php file?
[22:34:43] <Cork> $("input[name='bWV0aG9k']").val(linkprefix[0]);   data: $("form[name='url_parser']").serialize(),
[22:34:59] <Cork> could just as well have been data: { bWV0aG9k: linkprefix[0] },
[22:35:07] <Cork> same result just without the dom actions
[22:36:12] <LukeNukem> url: 'remote_web_query.php?bWV0aG9k='+linkprefix[0],
[22:36:13] <LukeNukem> hows that?
[22:36:23] <Cork> no
[22:36:30] <Cork> that would be a get attribute
[22:36:42] <Cork> just add the linkprefix to the data
[22:37:29] <LukeNukem> Cork, i think i want GET
[22:37:31] <LukeNukem> much easier :)
[22:37:58] <Cork> uh...
[22:38:11] <Cork> no its almost identical
[22:38:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pPCKm/1/
[22:38:35] <Cork> LukeNukem: just replace post with get if you want a get request
[22:38:37] <LukeNukem> so data appends a get field to the url
[22:38:45] <Time2303> awesome, jsfiddle was offline before.
[22:38:48] <Cork> if its a get request yes
[22:39:06] <LukeNukem> Time2303, ye
[22:40:14] <LukeNukem> Cork, so i want to display the content from php on the page right, so json?
[22:40:34] <Cork> LukeNukem: json, or html ja
[22:40:39] <LukeNukem> html ja? O.O
[22:40:47] <Cork> opps *ya
[22:41:17] <LukeNukem> well i want to verify if the content passed back is empty or not, php generates custom tags with content in them
[22:41:27] <LukeNukem> <title-tag>TITLE</title-tag>
[22:41:33] <Cork> btw is the preview an image or what?
[22:41:43] <LukeNukem> Cork, what ever information is available
[22:41:59] <Cork> you don't know?
[22:42:00] <LukeNukem> it looks for three things, title, paragraph, image
[22:42:11] <LukeNukem> and returns whatever can be grabbed from the page
[22:42:13] <Cork> uh.. ok so your getting xml?
[22:42:26] <LukeNukem> html with xpath ^.^
[22:42:45] <Cork> title-tag doesn't sounds like html or xpath to me
[22:42:58] <LukeNukem> Cork, well im returning data as xml yes
[22:43:05] <Cork> ...
[22:43:15] <LukeNukem> the php outputs data in xml
[22:43:39] <Cork> ok so grab the xml and parse it, you can search in it with jquery
[22:44:06] <LukeNukem> like so $('title-tag').text();
[22:44:29] <Cork> no $('title-tag', xml).text()
[22:44:40] <LukeNukem> okay
[22:44:41] <Cork> where xml is the response varaible from the ajax request
[22:44:54] <LukeNukem> the success callback right
[22:45:09] <Cork> the first attribute in the success callback yes
[22:45:37] <Cork> make sure the php script returns the right mimetype
[22:45:49] <LukeNukem>  success: function(xml)
[22:46:05] <Cork> the mimetype needs to be application/xml
[22:46:14] <LukeNukem> hmm ok
[22:46:51] <LukeNukem> Looks good ?
[22:46:52] <LukeNukem>             success: function(xml){
[22:46:52] <LukeNukem>             var title_tag = $('title-tag', xml).text()
[22:46:52] <LukeNukem>             if(title_tag != ''){ alert(title_tag) }
[22:46:52] <LukeNukem>             }
[22:46:55] <Cork> LukeNukem: but to answer you question before, it would prob be simpler to change the php script to json encode the data
[22:47:06] <Cork> LukeNukem: don't paste lines in the channel
[22:47:37] <Cork> but ya that looks fine
[22:55:05] <LukeNukem> Cork, this is what worked http://notey.it/n/NDU
[22:55:15] <LukeNukem> but its html :\ dunno whats wrong but it works
[22:56:43] <Cork> LukeNukem: no need to add it to a dom element
[22:56:56] <Chat5299> Hey have you had it before
[22:57:41] <Cork> LukeNukem: and you prob didn't give the selector your xml and thats why it didn't work
[22:58:07] <Cork> LukeNukem: what your doing now is adding it to the main document then use the default document for your search
[22:58:31] <Cork> and thats not what you should be doing in any way or form
[22:59:19] <LukeNukem> Cork, so i should set application type to xml in php
[22:59:24] <LukeNukem> and then do a normal search for the data
[22:59:34] <Cork> yes
[22:59:34] <LukeNukem> rather than in the current doc
[22:59:56] <Cork> if your sending xml you should say your sending xml
[23:00:13] <LukeNukem> never worked with xml before, so im a little confused. :) thanks
[23:00:20] <Cork> LukeNukem: uh.. btw no not application type
[23:00:36] <Cork> you should set the mime type on your answer to application/xml
[23:00:37] <LukeNukem> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
[23:00:38] <LukeNukem> i guess
[23:00:42] <Cork> no
[23:00:52] <Cork> ?g php_header mimetype
[23:00:53] <bot-t> Cork, PHP: header - Manual - http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
[23:01:20] <LukeNukem> ah, you want me to send a xml response header
[23:01:21] <LukeNukem> right?
[23:01:34] <Cork> the mimetype yes
[23:01:37] <LukeNukem> okay
[23:01:47] <LukeNukem> anyidea how i put that then o.o
[23:01:58] <Cork> i just linked you...
[23:02:12] <LukeNukem> i got the header thing, but the xml thing lol
[23:05:47] <brianpWins> anyone use jquery-file-upload?
[23:07:18] <LukeNukem> Cork, nope, i set the headers
[23:07:21] <LukeNukem> i dont recieve anything
[23:13:54] <LukeNukem> Cork, ?
[23:14:30] <Cork> LukeNukem: whats in xml?
[23:15:14] <JanxSpirit> should I be able to do something like this:
[23:15:27] <JanxSpirit> $.getJSON('users',function(data) {
[23:15:31] <JanxSpirit> alert(data);
[23:15:41] <LukeNukem> what do you mena whats in xml?
[23:15:45] <JanxSpirit> });
[23:15:53] <Cork> lukeas14: the variable
[23:15:58] <Cork> JanxSpirit: no
[23:16:05] <Cork> opps sorry
[23:16:14] <Cork> read wrong
[23:16:17] <LukeNukem> Cork, http://notey.it/n/NDY
[23:16:32] <Cork> JanxSpirit: data is parsed json
[23:16:44] <Cork> JanxSpirit: alert will only print [object]
[23:16:58] <Cork> or similar
[23:17:17] <JanxSpirit> Cork: it isn't printing - that's the confusing part
[23:17:32] <JanxSpirit> sorry - I'm a real JQuery noob
[23:17:42] <Cork> JanxSpirit: does the request succeed?
[23:17:46] <JanxSpirit> yes
[23:17:57] <JanxSpirit> I see a reasonable Json result in firebug
[23:18:10] <Cork> LukeNukem: thats only the code, what type of data is in the xml variable
[23:18:18] <LukeNukem> strings
[23:18:21] <JanxSpirit> 200 response status
[23:18:31] <Cork> JanxSpirit: try validating the json
[23:18:36] <Cork> ?g json validate
[23:18:37] <bot-t> Cork, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://jsonlint.com/
[23:18:38] <LukeNukem> like <title-render>9GAG</title-render>
[23:18:58] <Cork> LukeNukem: your sure thats what you get and not something parsed?
[23:19:05] <Cork> check the variable
[23:20:13] <LukeNukem> what do you mean something parsed
[23:20:36] <Linex__> I put title: $('#divTeam').data('title') as one of my .dialog options but its not happening. Not sure why ?
[23:20:42] <Cork> LukeNukem: i mean check what the xml variable really contains when you get the callback
[23:20:50] <Cork> LukeNukem: is it a string or what
[23:21:12] <LukeNukem> Cork, im not getting any data
[23:21:14] <LukeNukem> -_-
[23:21:33] <Cork> Linex__: does #divTeam have an attribute data-title?
[23:21:45] <Linex__> Cork: yes
[23:21:46] <Cork> LukeNukem: uh.. didn't you say it worked befroe?
[23:21:55] * anphonic thinks Cork has their hands full
[23:22:06] <LukeNukem> Cork, when i used html it did
[23:22:27] <JanxSpirit> Cork: yeah that was it - server side bug - it surprised me that it just silently failed - thanks
[23:22:34] <Cork> LukeNukem: sounds like your xml is invalid then
[23:22:47] <LukeNukem> can i use json or something
[23:22:53] <Cork> JanxSpirit: not silently
[23:22:58] <mindis|wurk> if i create a new node with range.createContextualFragment() and range.insertNode(), how do i focus() into that new node?
[23:23:01] <Cork> JanxSpirit: you get an error in the js console
[23:23:22] <LukeNukem> Cork, if i json_encode the output in php, how can i receive it in jquery
[23:23:40] <Cork> mindis|wurk: that node needs to have tabindex if you want to be able to put focus on it
[23:24:07] <Cork> LukeNukem: the same way you just did, it'll just be parsed json instead
[23:24:19] <LukeNukem> ,json?
[23:24:20] <LukeNukem> o.o
[23:24:22] <mindis|wurk> oh. i'm mainly trying to prevent my editablecontent div becoming completely empty so that user always types into a <p> instead of into the div itself
[23:24:30] <Cork> LukeNukem: but i think your problem is you need to validate your generated data
[23:25:02] <Cork> mindis|wurk: thats caracter position
[23:25:05] <Cork> not really focus
[23:25:17] <mindis|wurk> i know but i don't know how to make it happen without it
[23:25:23] <Cork> the normal select features can do that
[23:25:48] <LukeNukem> Cork, i am asking in the xml channel ^_^
[23:26:11] <mindis|wurk> normal select features? can't think of how...
[23:26:14] <Linex__> Cork: $("#divTeam").dialog({ autoOpen: false, modal: true, title: $("#divTeam").data('title'), ....
[23:26:20] <Cork> LukeNukem: one of the things i suspect is that your xml document has multible roots
[23:26:34] <Cork> Linex__: or sorry one sec
[23:26:46] <LukeNukem> Cork, hmm, i guess i will just use html :\
[23:29:10] <Cork> Linex__: have you tried console.log($("#divTeam").data('title')) so it outputs what you expect?
[23:31:10] <Linex__> Cork yes.  I notice that if I save it as a variable first like this var mytitle = $("#divTeam").data('title'). Its ok.
[23:31:30] <Cork> weird...
[23:31:34] <Cork> that shouldn't matter
[23:31:38] <Linex__> Cork: yep
[23:31:59] <Linex__> Cork: its alright. thanks for trying.
[23:32:19] <anphonic> why do programmers work late nights? Cause we're so damned smart we have to be exhausted to focus!
[23:33:31] <LukeNukem> Cork, i need to set <root>
[23:33:51] <csarmi> .
[23:38:18] <anphonic> finally, reinvented lat/lon lookup via zipcode
[23:43:01] <LukeNukem> Cork, turns out my xml was invalid
[23:43:20] <Cork> ya
[23:43:24] <LukeNukem> now i get outputs :)
[23:43:35] <LukeNukem> reading those syntax on w3c helped
[23:44:39] <someprimetime> so i guess britney spears came to my work today and i missed it
[23:44:44] <rabbi1> is Stephane here ?
[23:45:04] <someprimetime> ಠ_ಠ
[23:45:08] <LukeNukem> Cork, i set it to alert the title-render
[23:45:11] <LukeNukem> and it does it 5-6 times
[23:45:44] <Cork> so you have multible elements
[23:46:11] <Cork> LukeNukem: it works the same way normal selectors work
[23:46:29] <Cork> you need to figure out what you want to select
[23:46:37] <LukeNukem> im selecting title-render
[23:46:39] <LukeNukem> its alerting it too much times
[23:46:43] <LukeNukem> just once i want it to alert
[23:46:56] <LukeNukem> i think it alerts depending on the amount of keystrokes
[23:46:57] <LukeNukem> since i use keyup
[23:47:02] <Cork> ya
[23:47:09] <LukeNukem> any other choice?
[23:47:11] <Cork> you still need to implement the delay solution
[23:47:22] <LukeNukem> Cork, how can i do that?
[23:47:31] <Cork> like i said a timer
[23:47:42] <LukeNukem> any links?
[23:47:51] <Cork> setTimeout and reset the old timer when a new keyup happens
[23:47:56] <Cork> not sure there is onw
[23:47:59] <Cork> *one
[23:48:51] <Cork> LukeNukem: something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2618865/cleartimeout-not-working-in-javascript-autocomplete-script
[23:49:14] <Cork> i would replace this.timer with $(this).data('timer')
[23:49:46] <LukeNukem> can you explain the logic?
[23:50:08] <Cork> you want to delay sending the request until the user stops typing
[23:50:16] <LukeNukem> after every 2000 seconds the ajax script will be run
[23:50:17] <LukeNukem> am i right?
[23:50:19] <Cork> that way you don't send one request for each keystroke
[23:50:26] <Cork> yes
[23:50:32] <LukeNukem> this does not check if user stopped typing
[23:50:32] <LukeNukem> does it
[23:50:32] <Cork> you prob don't want that long though
[23:50:40] <Cork> more like 300-500 ms
[23:50:48] <Cork> it does
[23:51:06] <LukeNukem> e this
[23:51:07] <LukeNukem> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4412439/jquery-find-out-whether-user-is-typing-or-not
[23:51:12] <Cork> the timer triggers if the user haven't typed in the interval amount of time
[23:51:33] <Cork> LukeNukem: thats not what you want
[23:51:46] <Cork> sigh, i give up... do what ever you want
[23:52:35] <lukebrannon> i'm using the selectable method within a table, and my question is once you select a cell (or possibly more) is it possible to "copy" the contents using the copy keyboard command?  I've been trying to bind to copy to the selected cell, but it seems like it requires a text field of some sort?
[23:52:42] <hExDj> how can I add a new class to an <a> element that contains a specific string?
[23:53:28] <Cork> you mean in the content of the element?
[23:53:38] <Cork> like <a>special stirng</a> ?
[23:53:39] <hExDj> oh actually in the href
[23:54:15] <hExDj> <a href="some/url">….</a>
[23:54:17] <Cork> 'a[href*="something"]'
[23:54:39] <Cork> if it begins, ends or is exactly you can specify that too
[23:54:42] <doktorj> hi, can anyone help me f igure out how to do a get a data value from an existing image with a data eleement attached (using html 5)? it's been driving me crazy all night and must be simple: https://gist.github.com/2042594
[23:55:52] <Cork> doki_pen_: you need the # for id searches
[23:56:06] <Cork> and #{thumb_id} isn't valid in js
[23:56:14] <hExDj> cork: and use .addClass() ?
[23:56:27] <Cork> hExDj: yes
[23:56:39] <doktorj> cork: i'm using coffeescript and jquery so that part is valid
[23:56:41] <Cork> doktorj: $("#material_thumb_1").data('large_image')
[23:56:44] <Time2303> using a[href=""] is really slow, isn't it?
[23:56:54] <Time2303> comparing it to other methods of selecting
[23:56:59] <Cork> Time2303: yes
[23:57:11] <doktorj> cork: what's the _1 for
[23:57:12] <hExDj> thanks
[23:57:14] <doktorj> ?
[23:57:18] <Cork> :contains is slowes, then comes attribute, then class and first id
[23:57:21] <odtukoge> Also attribute selectors aren't very well supported.
[23:57:23] <doktorj> oh the id
[23:57:31] <odtukoge> Better than child selectors but still it'd dodgy.
[23:57:40] <LukeNukem> Cork, i guess the link i gave you works just like keypress
