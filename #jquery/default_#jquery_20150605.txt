[01:24:14] <Justus> hi
[01:25:26] <rflx> Hi, there is some issue with my jQuery code http://jsbin.com/culepilebu/2/edit?js want to disable the parallax function when the viewport is < 767px. On the other side the parallax function should be reloaded when the viewport is > 767px. I've tried with adding and removing classes but the function is still attachet to the element. Also tried to .unbind() the function. The main issue is on resizing,, any hints? Thx rflx
[01:26:54] <Justus> rflx: I do not understand what your problem is, you are calling parallaxInit in resize yourself
[01:27:12] <Justus> what is the actual "issue" you have?
[01:28:11] <Justus> I'm having a bit of a conundrum here, I need to implement drag and drop where sometimes the drop zones might be dragable themselves, I've toyed around with many different plugins and all are apparently not usable in case of nested elements, does anybody know of a plugin that is?
[01:31:47] <rflx> Jusus: if i load the page on a larger viewport than 767 and resize it to < 767 the parallax function is still attached to the element $('banner')
[01:31:58] <X-Chris> hello! is there a jquery plugin with google calendar functionality.. like drag to add event ?
[01:32:29] <Justus> rflx: you are calling parallaxInit after viewportCheck
[01:39:58] <rflx> Justus: if i change/reorder the call the function still grabs the element.
[01:48:52] <Justus> rflx: have you tried adding the width check to the parallaxInit function?
[01:49:39] <rflx> Justus: will have a try.
[01:49:40] <Chulbul> Im using twitter bootstrap wizard plugin .. unable to get currentIndex() .. on TabClick
[01:49:48] <Chulbul> https://github.com/VinceG/twitter-bootstrap-wizard/issues/4
[02:01:57] <rflx> Justus: i've tried what you said, but with no effect. If i load the page on <767 the function parallax is not active, thats right and also when i'll resize to >767 the parallax function will be active. But when im trying to resize down the parallax function is still there. :/
[02:02:43] <lamppid> maybe somebody can run this test on mac pc and post screenshot? https://jsperf.com/cwahlers-getimagedata/10
[02:02:54] <Deele> I don't see jsonp request in firefox network tab, initiated by jquery, is there a fix for that? I need to debug it.
[02:03:22] <Chulbul> http://kopy.io/oo8HU#ydo1ZHdqiyJiJC
[02:03:52] <Chulbul> now console.log(e) had displayed so much content .. how would i know how to get particular value ?
[02:04:25] <Cork> Chulbul: check the value in the console?
[02:04:32] <Cork> (btw don't use return false)
[02:05:42] <Chulbul> Cork , I want to disable tabs click and want to activate it on next click and on the same time previous clicks will remain enabled .. im using twitter bootstrap tabs .. how to do it ...
[02:05:51] <Chulbul> Cork , what else to use instead of return false;
[02:06:03] <Cork> event.preventDefault()
[02:06:05] <Chulbul> e.preventDefault();
[02:06:15] <Chulbul> hmm ok
[02:07:40] <Chulbul> values in console is currentTarget ..  namespaces .. and so on ..where to find current tab index and active tab index things like that ..
[02:07:43] <Chulbul> cork
[02:08:36] <Cork> Chulbul: you don't find that on the event object
[02:08:36] <Chulbul> its complicated .. it seems like e.somevalue.somevalue.somevalue.somevalue.index .. but there must be somethign else
[02:08:40] <Chulbul> Cork , then how to find it
[02:08:52] <Cork> you could try $(this).index()
[02:09:12] <Cork> it was a long time since i used jquery ui tabs
[02:09:32] <Thomsen> Question: On a page I have a Table that is Sortable(). On update event I save the new position to the backend using ajax. Now I change the order of a few rows and click a link to take me to another page. Clicking the back button takes me back to the table page but the rows are now in the initial order. I hit F5 and the rows are in the new order. So the page is cached in the version that was originally on the server. Is there a way to invalidate c
[02:09:32] <Thomsen> aching of the page in the *update* event or how could this be fixed?
[02:09:36] <Chulbul> ok .. btw its not ui  tabs , its bootstrap tabs
[02:12:51] <Chulbul> cork , i can find the index .. dont know where to go and find code that i can write so that i can get current active tab id instead of writing my own code to chk active class and its index :D .. what if bootstrap provide all such things .. but where the hell shoulf I go and find it :(
[02:13:09] <Chulbul> tried to find it on google .. but i failed
[02:13:36] <Cork> Chulbul: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-activate
[02:14:04] <Cork> also http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-activate
[02:14:13] <Cork> uh, opps
[02:14:23] <Chulbul> Cork , im using Bootstrap tabs and not jqueryui :p
[02:14:37] <Cork> ah, you're asking in the wrong channel then :)
[02:15:06] <Chulbul> no but thats totally javascript and I think combination of jquery as well
[02:15:17] <Cork> => ##bootstrap
[02:18:11] <Chulbul> Cork , ok .. but http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs :p
[02:18:28] <Chulbul> it seems as if that channel is something else
[02:21:06] <Chulbul> Cork :o . that was same channel . thanks :)

[02:59:52] <Cork> heh not without the code :)
[03:06:11] <Uhkis> Chilion: you seem to have a bug in your code

[03:07:22] <Chilion> CODE
[03:08:25] <Resourceful> Hi guys, I am not sure if this is the proper channel but the website I am building does use jQuery.  Whenever I open the website from a smartphone it just displays blank unless I request the desktop version. When I request the desktop version it shows the mobile layout I have - I am using jQuery and Bootstrap
[03:10:00] <Cork> Chilion: i would guess as your json being invalid
[03:10:07] <Chilion> And the complete console. Uhkis and Cork https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aa540fcc65a2dad77a26
[03:10:10] <Cork> Chilion: or you're double parsing the json
[03:10:26] <Chilion> I do a echo json_encode in the PHP file to which the post goes
[03:10:51] <Cork> Chilion: if your server is correctly configured and send json (instead of text/html)
[03:11:02] <Cork> jquery will parse the response automatically
[03:11:28] <Cork> Chilion: just encoding the content isn't enough, you have to set content-type header
[03:11:43] <Cork> so the client can know what it is you're sending
[03:12:25] <Chilion> I just return a json_encoded array
[03:12:28] <Chilion> Not good?
[03:13:10] <Chilion> Wheter I parse it or not, it doesn't work
[03:23:23] <Resourceful> Cork:  do you have any idea what might be causing this?

[05:37:48] <notchris> Good morning
[06:00:56] <laloune> hello all!
[06:06:47] <sabygo> can someone explain me the use of '*' in jquery selector
[06:08:46] <Cork> sabygo: its the same as for css selectors
[06:09:10] <sabygo> Cork: what actual use of this
[06:09:18] <Cork> it matches any element
[06:09:34] <sabygo> Cork: i have a statement '$('*:visible:has(> ' + this.options.anchorableSelector + '),' + ' *:visible:has(> ' + this.options.justifiableSelector + ')', this.element)'
[06:09:48] <sabygo> Cork: can you explain me this
[06:10:04] <Cork> how much do you know about css selectors?
[06:10:46] <sabygo> Cork: I KNNOW WITH css selectors we can select any div or from etc
[06:10:54] <sabygo> Cork: like a class
[06:11:01] <sabygo> Cork: etc
[06:11:09] <Cork> so... barely anything?
[06:11:29] <Cork> :visible is a psudo class
[06:11:38] <Cork> :has() is a jquery extension
[06:11:41] <sabygo> Cork: ya a class whis is visible
[06:11:51] <Cork> no
[06:11:57] <sabygo> then
[06:12:06] <Cork> ?mdn :visible
[06:12:06] <b-ot> Cork: visibility - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility
[06:12:17] <Cork> bah
[06:12:39] <Cork> man mdn is really bad on css selectors >_<
[06:13:04] <Cork> sabygo: https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-class-selectors/
[06:13:23] <Cork> the star there is actually not needed, as it is implied if you remove it
[06:14:02] <sabygo> Cork: ok thanks
[06:14:07] <sabygo> Cork: bro
[06:14:49] <Cork> sabygo: you might find: $(':visible').has('> ' + this.options.anchorableSelector + '),' + ':has(> ' + this.options.justifiableSelector + ')')
[06:14:51] <Cork> more readable
[06:14:57] <Cork> opps
[06:15:16] <Cork> sabygo: * you might find: $(':visible').has('> ' + this.options.anchorableSelector + ',' + '> ' + this.options.justifiableSelector)
[06:15:27] <Cork> more readable, it does the same thing as you're selector
[06:15:52] <sabygo> Cork: humm thanks
[06:16:25] <Cork> basically it selects all elements that are visible, and then removes the ones that doesn't have an element matching those two selectors as a child
[06:16:38] <Cork> (yes, this is a selector you shouldn't use)
[06:35:03] <hrusti> what is the best way to get set of data-attribute of multiple elements. e.g. if there are 5 div elements with "foo" class and different "data-bar" value how do I get set of data-bar values? Is only solution for loop?
[06:46:49] <Cork> hrusti: yes, one way or another you have to loop
[06:46:57] <Cork> though you could hide it
[06:47:23] <Cork> $.map($('.selector'), function(elm) { return $(this).data('bar'); })
[07:12:27] <gambl0re> can anyone recommend some good jquery tutorials that i can do to really practice my jquery skills?
[07:12:44] <gambl0re> im learning how to do a image slider, anything else i can try?
[07:14:15] <mbrzuzy> Modal windows
[07:14:41] <mbrzuzy> You could look through some of the components available in frameworks like bootstrap and try to recreate some of them on your own
[07:15:03] <gambl0re> modal is when a new window pops up?
[07:19:32] <mbrzuzy> yea
[08:09:28] <iamcenz> hey everyone.
[08:09:45] <gambl0re> hi
[08:09:56] <iamcenz> i was wondering if someone can give me a hand with something, it might be really easy but i am just overlooking it
[08:10:50] <goodenough> wut is it?
[08:11:24] <iamcenz> i am using .toggleClass() on a li and it works perfect as long as you click on the same li, but if you click on a different one, i need the original to go back to the first state.
[08:12:34] <iamcenz> http://pastebin.com/bJp7eBem
[08:15:17] <goodenough> `paste
[08:15:17] <b-ot> goodenough: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:22:41] <iamcenz> i created a js fiddle to show you want i mean. http://jsfiddle.net/nL2akbkd/
[08:23:41] <iamcenz> you have the have the window under 768px thats the only problem at the moment its for a mobile design. lol
[08:24:03] <robertmaxrees> i was late - what's going on?
[08:24:14] <iamcenz> but when you open the side menu there is multiple drop downs
[08:24:41] <iamcenz> when you click on one the chevron class changes via toggleClass()
[08:25:14] <iamcenz> but when you click on a different with the original one still open it closes the drop down but doesnt toggle the class back
[08:25:59] <iamcenz> i cant figure out how to make it so it puts the class back to chevron-down once you click on something else
[08:28:00] <monk12> hey all, just curious i have a Single Page JS app, and the view thats served created 2 iframe elements. in the controller I add contents to the body of the iframe elements. then on the next page of a single page app, there are 3 iframe elements... when i do $('iframe') in the console i see 5 iframes with id's of #pixel0, #pixel1, #pixel2 and #pixel0, #pixel1... but if i do $('#pixel0').length i see only 1.
[08:28:10] <monk12> is there anyway to cleanup the old iframes that aren't on the page anymore so they aren't in memory?
[08:29:01] <robertmaxrees> iamcenz easy - $('.chevron-up').removeClass('chevron-up').addClass('chevron-down');
[08:29:05] <robertmaxrees> or whatever your classnames are.
[08:29:40] <robertmaxrees> monk12 that's not a valid page fwiw.
[08:29:43] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs.
[08:30:27] <robertmaxrees> monk12 also: it's not necessarily a "memory" issue, but you can remove things before transitioning if you want.
[08:30:37] <monk12> hey robertmaxrees.... i know. the page only has 3 elements on page 2... angular refreshes the view so only pixel0, pixel1, and pixel2 exist on the next view. previous view is gone
[08:30:58] <monk12> but jquery still shows the 5 elements when i run $('iframe') in the console.
[08:31:22] <robertmaxrees> because they're still in the document.
[08:31:40] <robertmaxrees> angular "views" are not the DOM.
[08:31:45] <monk12> but not in the actual DOM though.
[08:31:50] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[08:31:51] <robertmaxrees> except they are.
[08:32:00] <robertmaxrees> that's the only way they can exist.
[08:32:07] <robertmaxrees> jquery only reads from the DOM.
[08:33:04] <monk12> K. ill try clearing out the iframe elements when leaving the view. is there a good way to clear out those elements from DOM... .remove()?
[08:33:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[08:33:21] <monk12> cool thanks robertmaxrees i'll give that a try.
[08:33:24] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[08:35:02] <iamcenz> robertmaxrees but how would i do to the last item clicked? so say i click on item 1 and toggleClass() swaps the chevron-down to chevron-up then i click on item 2. Item 1s chevron is still up and now Item 2 has chevron up as well
[08:35:22] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[08:35:33] <robertmaxrees> just run $('.chevron-up').removeClass('chevron-up').addClass('chevron-down'); before doing anything else.
[08:35:55] <robertmaxrees> $('.chevron-up').removeClass('chevron-up').addClass('chevron-down'); will find anything with the chevron-up class, remove that class, and give it a chevron-down class.
[08:36:01] <monk12> robertmaxrees: cool that worked. I just remove() when i click 'next' button in my questionnaire app.
[08:36:03] <monk12> thanks again
[08:36:08] <robertmaxrees> monk12 yep.
[08:36:59] <iamcenz> robertmaxrees ok let me give that a try
[08:48:05] <iamcenz> robertmaxrees that fixed the one problem but now my toggleClass does not work. so if i click the same item it wont swap the class
[08:48:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid using toggleclass.
[08:48:32] <robertmaxrees> explicitly add/remove them instead.
[08:57:00] <monk12> might have a 2nd quick question... so tracking pixels are kinda crazy... they can be img tags, iframe tags, script tags that point to JS files, script tags with code to execute, and a combo of previous (with <noscript> mixed in, or GA which loads a JS file then has JS code to execute). to make things simple to not clutter my Single Page Angular app with their variables load the code to run in an iframe... but its not working
[08:57:00] <monk12> as expected for code that has document.write's like DoubleClick tracking... Here is a simple example of what trying to achieve in Jquery: http://plnkr.co/edit/3wordH8UpjCUkYei5r1i?p=preview ...
[08:57:30] <monk12> my question is why does the document.write which gets appended to the iframe, get actually run in the parent window and replace the content of my parent window.
[08:57:47] <monk12> I'd expect it to be limited to the iframe which its appended to.
[08:58:04] <robertmaxrees> first off - don't use document.write ever
[08:58:22] <robertmaxrees> that's a big no-no in general.
[08:58:24] <monk12> I don't, major tracking companies do. so can't fix their code :)
[08:58:37] <robertmaxrees> right, but what you're doing is really unusual.
[08:59:20] <monk12> yes, loading it in an iframe is a bit unusual, just didn't want to clutter my app with their code. who knows whats running in there... they could put JS which kills our app... so thought putting in an iframe would be best option for now.
[08:59:37] <robertmaxrees> except now they cannot read the variables they need.
[08:59:42] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[08:59:53] <robertmaxrees> it's not a big deal - trust me.
[08:59:55] <monk12> how so? usually its just sending a conversion
[09:00:07] <robertmaxrees> depending on the vendor, they need to read state from the window in some cases.
[09:00:17] <monk12> like and the iframe is on the same  so no cross origin issues
[09:00:20] <monk12> same domain*
[09:00:34] <robertmaxrees> just skip the headaches and implement what they give you.
[09:00:39] <robertmaxrees> without the iframes.
[09:00:41] <robertmaxrees> it's really not that bad.
[09:01:51] <monk12> so the web service returns the next page content in angulars controller... i see in the web service what pixels they have... should i just do a foreach(pixel in pixels){ $('body').append(pixel.content) } ?
[09:02:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd read their APIs and make sure there's no way to hook into them and get what you're looking for.
[09:02:45] <robertmaxrees> which analytics vendors are you working with?
[09:03:15] <monk12> ga, facebook, doubleclick, and then hundreds of other companies that implemented their own tracking solutions (bleh).
[09:03:27] <robertmaxrees> "hundreds"?
[09:03:59] <monk12> yeh companies that deal with pharmas and want to track their results with their own JS/iframe/img conversion solutions
[09:03:59] <robertmaxrees> something smells here, but i'd start reading docs.  those should all have methods to fire a manual "pageload" type thing.
[09:04:20] <decx> doubleclick implementation is basicly hitler
[09:04:29] <decx> globals - globals everywhere
[09:04:37] <robertmaxrees> fwiw it sounds like your real problem is that you have "hundreds" of analytics/advert scripts on your site.
[09:04:50] <zsoc> Ok I give up. $(this) is what I expect it to be but when I put it in a named function, it no longer is. How do I access $(this) that would have been in the scope outside of this named function?
[09:05:02] <decx> precache
[09:05:13] <decx> feed it as an argument into the function
[09:05:13] <robertmaxrees> zsoc depends on the case - example?
[09:05:17] <monk12> like i dont know what code is running, marketing enters pixels blindly vendors give us. and I just have a solution to make it work with all pixels.
[09:05:19] <decx> bind(this)
[09:05:20] <robertmaxrees> or .bind(this)
[09:05:24] <decx> these are your options
[09:05:33] <robertmaxrees> monk12 yeah, that's not sustainable.
[09:05:34] <pothepanda> hi, anyone can direct me on whats a good way to display information while a page loads?
[09:05:47] <robertmaxrees> we went through that pain here, it's not worth it.
[09:05:54] <monk12> in 1 questionaiire they may be only 1 pixel fire. Im just curious why that document.write isn't considered local to the iframe.
[09:06:10] <zsoc> robertmaxrees, I have an $(some element).hover(function () {... right then, $(this) is what I expect. But if then I have function doSomething() { $(this)... it's now outside of the scope that "this" is the element anymore...
[09:06:12] <monk12> if i can get doubleclick workign in the iframe, then I think I'd solve all pixel issues.
[09:06:25] <decx> zsoc we gave you the 3 options
[09:06:27] <monk12> but they do a document.write like my simple example, so just why doesn't apply to the iframe
[09:06:39] <robertmaxrees> zsoc please show an actual code example where you make the call.
[09:06:51] <decx> doubleclicks document.write is the worst
[09:07:00] <zsoc> Ok, let me first look up the docs for bind and see if I can figure it out that way, thank you.
[09:07:03] <decx> they dont just have it in the embed code but also in the js that gets loaded
[09:07:08] <decx> it's ridiculous
[09:08:31] <robertmaxrees> monk12 just to point it out btw - that use of .ready() isn't doing what you think it is.
[09:08:58] <monk12> i debated removing it :) wasnt sure what it actually does hehe.
[09:09:10] <monk12> saw it in a code example with iframe html writing
[09:09:14] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/ready/ - "The .ready() method can only be called on a jQuery object matching the current document, so the selector can be omitted."
[09:11:53] <robertmaxrees> also, your issue isn't what you think it is.
[09:11:59] <monk12> so if i remove it... when the append adds the script it overwrites the parent even thought i dont do something like window.parent.document.write('blah'), but the 2nd example works as i expect and applies only the iframe window... http://plnkr.co/edit/jXEaB1rKntSkaq9VX8EO?p=preview vs http://plnkr.co/edit/I1MZ0BcAGbx9C8rmZMH2?p=preview
[09:12:02] <robertmaxrees> the code IS appending too the iframe.
[09:12:40] <monk12> 2nd example does an alert() instead of document.write().
[09:12:53] <robertmaxrees> the `document` reference is bad inside the .append() call.  something tells me it's getting executed before the actual append occurs.
[09:13:01] <robertmaxrees> but really, i wouldn't worry about it.
[09:13:41] <monk12> hmmmm gotcha... maybe its a reference to a Closure of the document in the orig tag
[09:13:47] <monk12> darn!
[09:13:50] <robertmaxrees> probably not.
[09:14:06] <robertmaxrees> it's probably that when the fragment gets created, it executes the JS there.
[09:14:17] <robertmaxrees> the document reference is the parent window, and boom.
[09:20:08] <monk12> robertmaxrees: trying to comprehend that last statement. think im almost there to understand it. let me ponder on that for a bit.
[09:20:33] <robertmaxrees> so what happens is jquery creates a document fragment - a pretty neat concept to begin with.
[09:21:09] <robertmaxrees> when it creates it with that code, the script tag immediately executes - in other words, the script tag doesn't wait to get to its destination.
[09:21:24] <robertmaxrees> so it runs, and the document.write is run against the parent window.  nothing ever makes it to the iframe.
[09:21:32] <monk12> darn i think i got it.
[09:21:45] <monk12> "By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string — .append(), etc. — can potentially execute code. This can occur by injection of script tags"
[09:21:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:21:54] <monk12> so it runs on the parent window.
[09:21:58] <robertmaxrees> in this case, yeah.
[09:22:12] <converge> can I get the SRC attribute of <img> when clicking at some #id ?
[09:22:21] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:22:40] <robertmaxrees> put an event listener on the #id and grab that .attr('src') of that image.
[09:23:27] <converge> robertmaxrees: how to identify ? clicked_id.attr('src') , how to get the clicked_id ?
[09:23:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:23:38] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[09:23:44] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're asking at this point.
[09:23:59] <robertmaxrees> unless the thing you're clicking is the image itself.
[09:25:15] <decx> i'm in need of someone throwing a violin in the air, fiddle up!
[09:26:38] <monk12> robertmaxrees: after some googling, found someone with same issue... Hmmm i'll take a look at some of the ideas there just to see if i can solve it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1591135/why-does-appending-a-script-to-a-dynamically-created-iframe-seem-to-run-the
[09:26:48] <robertmaxrees> monk12 that's the thing - you can't./
[09:26:55] <robertmaxrees> and in this case, it'ts a total waste of time.
[09:27:06] <robertmaxrees> you're going to break the reference to the correct document for the scripts themselves anyway.
[09:27:08] <monk12> like maybe not adding with jquery since it runs on the parent frame. but manually JS to add it.
[09:27:10] <robertmaxrees> it's really not worth it here.
[09:27:25] <monk12> append runs the scirpt tag. but manual add might not.
[09:27:47] <robertmaxrees> sure, and then your analytics will break because the scripts will all reference the wrong document.
[09:28:35] <converge> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/cdhrsfg4/ , I need to get the #ids dynamically, when clicking at #aaa changes #bbb content and the same for the other way around
[09:29:12] <robertmaxrees> there are a few different ways to approach this, converge
[09:30:21] <monk12> that *might* be fine. most tags are just 'incrementers' so as long as the GET gets called. The alternate solution just seems impossible to implement if i dont know what kinda tags are coming in.
[09:30:37] <robertmaxrees> monk12 you're making a lot of assumptions there.
[09:30:42] <robertmaxrees> most of which are inaccurate :)
[09:30:49] <monk12> haha :)
[09:30:57] <robertmaxrees> converge https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cdhrsfg4/2/
[09:31:52] <monk12> Can you give an example of lets say AdWords not working in that scenario? its on the same domain so it has access to the 3rd party cookie (well recent browsers like Safari seem to block those but anyway)
[09:32:14] <robertmaxrees> your analytics setups won't work because they'll be referencing the wrong document.
[09:32:24] <robertmaxrees> adwords also won't have the right reference.
[09:32:32] <robertmaxrees> it's really that simple.
[09:33:21] <converge> robertmaxrees: thanks
[09:34:05] <decx> what's a good analytics alternative that i can host myself?
[09:34:20] <decx> i have piwik on some sites but it's not exactly setting the world on fire
[09:35:30] <Dr-007> when requesting the height on a div that has a border. the height will be the css height minus the border
[09:35:33] <Dr-007> why is that?
[09:35:43] <Dr-007> on screen the border is on the outside of the div
[09:36:01] <Dr-007> so it shouldnt be minus the border ... right?
[09:36:02] <robertmaxrees> whcih method are you using?
[09:36:24] <Dr-007> placeholder_height = $('#ad_img_placeholder').height();
[09:36:37] <decx> outerHeight(true)
[09:36:42] <Dr-007> css; height: 255px; border: 3px solid green;
[09:36:47] <Dr-007> ah nice
[09:36:49] <Dr-007> thanks
[09:36:53] <rindolf> Hi all.
[09:36:57] <monk12> robertmaxrees: just want to spec this out... To me when you click a google ad, a cookie is set on googleadservices.com saying user clicked AD_Creative2, you arrive on  x.com at that point which has a 3rd party cookie that says user clicked on AD_Creative2 ... adwords gets added to the page in the iframe on my conversion page which is 20 questions later in my questionnaire app. it runs in the iframe... the iframe has the cookie
[09:36:57] <monk12>  info since it makes a call to the 3rd party domain, so the GET conversion gets increased appropriatly. What refernce is needed in the parent document?
[09:37:09] <decx> holy paragraph batman
[09:37:09] <robertmaxrees> monk12 good lord that's a wall of text.
[09:37:31] <monk12> lol
[09:37:54] <robertmaxrees> monk12 i try to avoid saying this, but you're pretty far off topic - you should probably start hitting up support forums.
[09:38:16] <monk12> okee dokee, sorry about that. thanks for your help though, helped me understand most of it.
[09:38:46] <decx> i tried to do it by hand with doubeclick and it basicly exploded if it wasnt done exactly as directed
[09:38:50] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:39:04] <robertmaxrees> long story short, what you're trying to do is going to result in pain and wasted time.
[09:39:17] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to solve a problem you're not having to begin with :)
[09:39:27] <decx> sure there is a problem
[09:39:31] <decx> tracking scripts are shit
[09:39:50] <robertmaxrees> hahaha this is true, but in this case, it's not going to cause him problems.
[09:50:29] <monk12> The problem is I need all vendor's pixels to fire though and there doesn't seem to be a nice way to handle it in a single page app (vs just throwing them at the end of a html page in a normal page app where the page refreshes and you can do <?php echo $pixels; ?> serverside). I'll try to think of alternate solutions for now.
[09:50:55] <robertmaxrees> start reading documentation - many of them should offer ways to handle that problem.
[09:51:51] <monk12> k, again some vendors have custom solutions so cant really figure out how to fire pixels in SPA for all vendors. could be hundreds of differents kinds of pixels :).
[09:52:14] <robertmaxrees> and back to my first point - the "hundreds" is the real issue ;)
[09:52:22] <robertmaxrees> hit up those vendors and see what they suggest.
[09:53:14] <Dr-007> anyone uses the livicons? if yes. do you know, if possible, how to change the color with jquery?
[09:53:38] <robertmaxrees> Dr-007 are you able to normally change the color?
[09:53:51] <monk12> K, thanks again robertmaxrees.
[09:55:13] <Dr-007> robertmaxrees; yes. but then the document is getting rendered from scratch. the livicon.js file is minified so i dont know if there are any functions to update the icon while it is already printed
[09:55:30] <Dr-007> so i dont really know how livicons get invoked
[09:55:40] <robertmaxrees> Dr-007 then you probably can't change it with jquery.
[09:56:06] <robertmaxrees> unless you rendered them all white and then put a colored transparent overlay on them or something.
[09:56:15] <Dr-007> hmmz
[09:56:34] <Dr-007> screw it. i'm going with a selection border. instead of a selection color.
[09:56:37] <Dr-007> problem solved! :)
[09:56:40] <robertmaxrees> hah
[10:03:26] <Lencl> I'm using jquery mobile and I have two popups. One works and one doesn't... they have different IDs.. I don't know why the other one won't show up
[10:03:27] <Lencl> http://76.79.253.139/~midev1/miwebsite/?id=2
[10:03:33] <Lencl> It's the one with #popupLogin
[10:03:53] <Lencl> I open the popup via $('#popupLogin').popup('open') in the bottom
[10:03:59] <robertmaxrees> Lencl we usually request that you use jsfiddle or a similar site to show us code.
[10:04:53] <Lencl> jsfiddle supports jquery mobile?
[10:05:16] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:05:28] <robertmaxrees> you can load any external script yout want.

[10:06:51] <christoph_> can anybody explain why a editable div inside a draggable is not editable anymore ?
[10:06:52] <christoph_> http://jsfiddle.net/MAEvS/574/
[10:07:18] <robertmaxrees> it is ;)
[10:07:24] <rindolf> christoph_: let me see.
[10:07:36] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ the mousedown is getting captured and canceled.
[10:08:23] <christoph_> that should not happend or am i wrong
[10:08:24] <robertmaxrees> if you right-click, you'll see it works just fine.
[10:08:55] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: or use the Tab key.
[10:08:59] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[10:09:18] <robertmaxrees> not sure which event you need to mess with to fix it.
[10:09:46] <christoph_> mhh
[10:10:00] <Lencl> ah found the issue.. putting it on jsfiddle made me realize it
[10:10:08] <robertmaxrees> Lencl ;)
[10:10:32] <christoph_> so it is no bug which will be fixed in further releases ?
[10:10:46] <robertmaxrees> christoph_ not really.
[10:10:55] <christoph_> mhhh okay
[10:10:58] <robertmaxrees> an editable in a draggable is kind of strange anyway.
[10:12:10] <christoph_> not really but okay , thanks anyway

[10:12:49] <paulvd> hello, i have a jquery/ajax click event, which pulls data and shows them as links, all this is fine, i have managed it this far, now i want another click event on that data, i have placed the jquery code in the right place, however its just not doing anything?
[10:13:00] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:13:04] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[10:13:20] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[10:13:45] <robertmaxrees> also http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events has some good info, as well.
[10:36:42] <teamcoltra> I am loading a text file from ajax but I want to remove the first line of the text file, the files are standardized and I can trust that the first line will always need to be removed but I am not sure what to do
[10:37:53] <rindolf> teamcoltra: use a regex.
[10:40:58] <teamcoltra> something like var text = text.replace(\A.*,''); ?
[10:41:27] <rindolf> teamcoltra: I don't think JS has a \A for start-of-string.
[10:41:53] <robertmaxrees> could do var lines = textblock.split('\n'); lines.splice(0,1);, var newtext = lines.join('\n');
[10:42:25] <rindolf> teamcoltra: try (function() { var s = "Hello\nFoo\nGood\n"; return s.replace(/^[^\n]*\n/,""); })();
[10:42:25] <teamcoltra> :P rindolf you set me in a great direction my brain was like "oh of course... this simple little regex" and then you rip it away from me
[10:43:13] <teamcoltra> rindolf that worked beautifully
[10:43:29] <teamcoltra> thanks robertmaxrees also for the suggestion, I didn't try it but conceptually that makes sense too
[10:43:33] <rindolf> teamcoltra: you're welcome .
[10:54:42] <joerg> hi
[10:55:52] <joerg> I'm using jquery datatables and have a table that is populated via ajax. there are <select> inputs in the cells. I cannot get the change event for them....any idea? what I tried: $("#myTable").on("change", "select.change_group", handler);
[11:08:25] <xcyclist> I am not completely understanding the "fill-from" specifier here:  $this.data("fill-from");
[11:09:09] <xcyclist> Here "fill-from" is the only location in the source file where this string exists.  Above here the start of the function is this jquery:  $("[data-fill-from]").each(function () {
[11:09:59] <xcyclist> So what comes to mind is somhow the .data("fill-from") is just allied with, or perhaps matching the data-fill-from string as a subset, but I see no reason for it.
[11:11:11] <xcyclist> Perhaps it is doing this in case other oddments are picked up with the original jquery call, but I wish I understood it better.
[11:22:03] <gambl0re> guys, im having trouble. take a look please.
[11:22:04] <gambl0re> http://jsfiddle.net/ydgshkgw/3/
[11:22:42] <gambl0re> when i add a new item list, it adds but i cant remove it if i click on it
[11:24:32] <robertBusy> because $('li').on('click', function(){ only binds to things taht exist when the page loads.
[11:24:36] <robertBusy> you need event delegation.
[11:24:41] <robertBusy> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[11:25:23] <gambl0re> so how can i remove items for those that are added?
[11:26:09] <robertBusy> use event delegation.
[11:40:14] <os-11258> good afternoon
[11:44:57] <os-11258> never mind i figured it out :)
[11:48:35] <Lencl> I'm getting an ajax POSt error
[11:48:51] <Lencl> problem is the URL doesn't return a response
[11:48:57] <Lencl> how do I output the error?
[11:50:10] <robertBusy> .fail()
[12:13:44] <monk12> robertmaxrees: i threw 50 of our most common tracking/vendor/pixels at this code and seems to be working out with no errors/issues (minus the possible issues with document you stated): http://plnkr.co/edit/3i4MEngTwZ8taIAEWbWr?p=preview so far handles adwords, facebook, doubleclick, iframes tags (pointing to vendor GET counters), img tags (pointing to vendor GET counters)
[12:14:34] <monk12> so it might work out for my needs (i will investigate what common pixels might need document reference before pushing live). just thought I'd send over the code.

[12:36:51] <Respek> Hi all, still getting used to using "this" in my functions, can I get a second set of eyes on this? http://pastebin.com/tVUU5ewN
[12:38:42] <robertBusy> what do you expect it to be?
[12:38:44] <robertBusy> :)
[12:38:48] <robertBusy> (it's pretty easy)
[12:42:39] <Respek> robertBusy well, I would expect that clicking either of this IDs would make that the "this" in question, and that it would work
[12:43:02] <Respek> however, this is still pretty foreign to me, so I suppose that might be wishful thining
[12:43:05] <Respek> *thinking
[12:43:15] <robertBusy> 9/10 with jquery, 'this' is the element you're invoking against.
[12:43:27] <Respek> so it would work!
[12:43:30] <robertBusy> nope.
[12:43:32] <Respek> gah!
[12:43:39] <Respek> I didn't understand what you meant then
[12:43:40] <robertBusy> because you're invoking against $('html, body');
[12:43:59] <Respek> ohhhhh
[12:44:16] <Respek> invoking against means the most recent, not the highest in the function
[12:44:17] <Respek> ok ok
[12:44:20] <Respek> learning...
[12:44:23] <robertBusy> you commonly see this pattern to work around that; http://fixee.org/paste/7xb566o/
[12:45:15] <Respek> thereby circumventing the next invoke, got it. makes sense!

[13:13:19] <tocka> hi guys, is it possible to send PHP session data to a page using get() ? What im doing is im getting information from a certain page, but it is only available once you are logged in as an admin user.
[13:13:20] <tocka> :o
[13:15:44] <robertBusy> gambl0re are you calling using a server, or just by double-clicking on the html file?
[13:21:45] <NoiseEee> tocka: what are you trying to do?
[13:22:05] <tocka> Im getting html of a page and auto updating it in another page
[13:22:14] <tocka> Basically like a live feed of a log
[13:22:16] <NoiseEee> tocka: where do the sessions come in?
[13:22:26] <tocka> When you login to the admin panel
[13:22:33] <tocka> a session is being set
[13:22:34] <NoiseEee> tocka: if you're doing this over xhr/ajax, cookies are sent too - php knows if you're logged in or not / has access to the session
[13:22:43] <tocka> NoiseEee thanks
[13:22:45] <tocka> Hm...
[13:22:49] <tocka> I was using get()
[13:22:51] <tocka> :/
[13:23:00] <tocka> $.get()
[13:23:11] <NoiseEee> should still be sent afaik
[13:23:15] <NoiseEee> but i use .ajax for everything
[13:23:15] <tocka> but it didnt show me that I was logged in... which i was :/
[13:23:21] <tocka> NoiseEee I will try out ajax;)
[13:23:22] <tocka> thanks
[13:28:12] <Respek> robertBusy well thanks as always then :) you're great
[13:34:28] <cjohnson> $foo.children('a') == $foo.find('> a')  ?
[13:34:36] <robertBusy> nope.
[13:34:42] <robertBusy> well, yeah kinda.
[13:34:50] <robertBusy> but that .find() syntax looks funk.
[13:34:53] <robertBusy> *funky
[13:35:02] <cjohnson> what about it?
[13:35:05] <cjohnson> find direct children of $foo
[13:35:08] <cjohnson> right
[13:35:11] <cjohnson> how else would you do that
[13:35:13] <robertBusy> just less apparent imo.
[13:35:18] <cjohnson> k
[13:35:24] <robertBusy> i'd just use .children()
[13:35:35] <cjohnson> ok so children won't descend past depth of 1
[13:35:40] <cjohnson> only direct descendent
[13:35:40] <robertBusy> yeah
[13:35:43] <cjohnson> cool
[13:37:49] <Respek> I'm having an issue on iPad where about 3 links aren't working. I came up with a solution, but it feels much more like it's on touch, not on "click".  For example, if you scroll over it, or use the area to scroll, it'll call that a click. is there a way to make it less of a catch-all?  http://pastebin.com/hm6c7B6L
[13:39:02] <Respek> hm, I realize that touchend is in there. perhaps that's what's making it so damn sensitive

[14:32:19] <testerbit> I'm using $.getJSON to get a file which is being sent in from a python dict, one object: 'element': "$('#sidebar-toggle')[0]", is causing problems because the quotes in the value, does getJSON provide a method to strip the quotes out?
[14:37:37] <robertmaxrees> that's nbot valid JSON fwiw.
[14:37:43] <robertmaxrees> element': "$('#sidebar-toggle')[0]",
[14:38:08] <robertmaxrees> err - "element": "$('#sidebar-toggle')" - you're also not supposed to shuffle around function calls.
[14:39:26] <Phase> http://hastebin.com/inalixumiz.coffee Why doesn't the null comparison (line 7) work in this?
[14:39:39] <robertmaxrees> because .val() doesn't return null ever
[14:39:46] <Phase> ty
[14:40:03] <robertmaxrees> it'll return an empty string
[14:40:14] <Phase> well if that's the case
[14:40:17] <Phase> then why does line 6 work?
[14:41:06] <robertmaxrees> because empy string is falsy

[15:08:46] <Dr-007> im getting this error: Error: cannot call methods on draggable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'destroy'
[15:08:55] <Dr-007> when doing this; $( "#ad_img_placeholder .masker img" ).draggable( "destroy" )
[15:09:07] <Dr-007> how can i test if it is initialized?
[15:12:39] <aNewBy> is anyone alive here? :)
[15:12:42] <shoky__> Dr-007 you can check if it has class ui-draggable or check if .data('ui-draggable') is defined
[15:12:47] <robertmaxrees> aNewBy yep
[15:12:56] <Dr-007> shoky__, thanks
[15:13:10] <aNewBy> I've got a question about deferred obj...
[15:13:17] <robertmaxrees> just ask.
[15:13:18] <aNewBy> i can't get them to work with my objs
[15:13:53] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ aNewBy
[15:14:08] <aNewBy> yea, i'm putting my code together now :d
[15:17:15] <aNewBy> !paste
[15:17:15] <b-ot> aNewBy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:19:22] <aNewBy> http://jsbin.com/tutevesali/1/ here's my problem: can't get the deferred to work
[15:19:56] <aNewBy> for 5 hours i've been banging my head with it :(
[15:20:09] <aNewBy> and you can see by the fail messages how frustrated i'm getting that it's not working :D
[15:21:41] <aNewBy> i've actually trimmed the methods coz they are longer and they take a while to get done so I need for the new method to wait for the bootup process to finish before doing other stuff there
[15:21:49] <aNewBy> any ideas wtf am I missing?
[15:21:59] <aNewBy> btw I'm a newbie with jquery :)
[15:24:14] <robertmaxrees> so first off "new" is a reserved word in JS so you should avoid using it like this.
[15:24:37] <robertmaxrees> second off, return $dfd; doesn't actually return out of the bootup function.
[15:24:46] <aNewBy> even for methods?
[15:24:52] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:24:55] <aNewBy> :O
[15:25:01] <aNewBy> but how come it's still working for me?
[15:25:06] <aNewBy> i mean it triggers the method :D
[15:25:07] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[15:25:24] <robertmaxrees> since this.bootup() isn't a deferred object, jquery assumes it's resolved and continues on.
[15:25:36] <aNewBy> hmm
[15:26:18] <aNewBy> but bootup is a deferred object
[15:26:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:26:22] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[15:26:26] <aNewBy> oooh
[15:26:26] <robertmaxrees> it's a plain old function.
[15:26:38] <aNewBy> yea
[15:26:44] <aNewBy> but i'm returning a deferred obj
[15:26:52] <robertmaxrees> noi you're not.
[15:26:58] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about return $dfd; right?
[15:27:07] <aNewBy> yep
[15:27:13] <robertmaxrees> that's returning out of the function you're calling from .then()
[15:27:16] <aNewBy> stupid jsbin doesn;'t have line numbering
[15:27:17] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't return from the outer function.
[15:27:35] <robertmaxrees> basically, that's not doing what you think it is.
[15:27:39] <robertmaxrees> there's an easier way to structure this.
[15:28:04] <aNewBy> please tell me
[15:28:15] <aNewBy> i've been struggling with this for hours now :|
[15:28:21] <aNewBy> i think i'm too stupid to get how it works
[15:28:27] <robertmaxrees> you're not stupid.
[15:28:30] <robertmaxrees> you're just now slowing down.
[15:28:38] <aNewBy> :))
[15:28:45] <aNewBy> is there a big difference? :D
[15:28:49] <robertmaxrees> very
[15:28:52] <aNewBy> anyway, tell me how to do it properly
[15:29:03] <aNewBy> i really wanna know how to do this right
[15:29:17] <aNewBy> i've looked into deferred.promise() but that's even more confusing ...
[15:30:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tz3bf4kb/
[15:30:33] <robertmaxrees> that's an oversimplified way to think abou tit.
[15:30:34] <robertmaxrees> *about it.
[15:30:42] <shoky> aNewBy: there's no need for creating any deferreds in your code, really
[15:30:56] <robertmaxrees> ^ sure there is - if they stopped acting like they're using callbacks :)
[15:31:01] <aNewBy> i've shortened the code :)
[15:31:05] <aNewBy> by a lot :D
[15:31:17] <aNewBy> i've got a lot of lengthy methods in my bootup method
[15:31:31] <shoky> nah no use creating deferreds. (that doesn't mean not using the promises returned by $.ajax or .then() )
[15:31:41] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, too.
[15:31:42] <aNewBy> they take about 7 seconds to complete and I wanna make a progress bar that will display the status of the progress
[15:32:03] <aNewBy> ok.... then how do I do this?
[15:32:24] <aNewBy> coz I wanna avoid using callbacks coz they're confusing to
[15:32:26] <aNewBy> too*
[15:33:01] <aNewBy> and I understand that callbacks and deferred and the only way to go about with async req
[15:33:58] <aNewBy> c'mon guys ... help out ... i'll give you cookies :D
[15:34:11] <shoky> but you don't have to create your own deferreds, manually. something like this could work.. http://jsbin.com/reponiqeyo/1/edit?js
[15:34:20] <Dr-007> i've got a resizable on a div. the handles are not in the right spot. anyone know why?
[15:35:18] <aNewBy> shoky thanks, i'll try it out now
[15:53:33] <aNewBy> so bootup is working fine, but new is not
[15:53:46] <aNewBy> so i'm thinking it's what you said :)
[15:55:49] <Phase> http://hastebin.com/eyodizujad.vhdl I'm trying to figure out how to store the value/state(?) of a checkbox in a variable (will eventually be a cookie after testing) for a userscript, but I have no idea how to do it with how the html looks in the paste.
[15:57:08] <aNewBy> shoky: thanks, it worked!~
[15:59:10] <shoky> Phase: didn't really understand what you wanna do.. and when
[16:00:09] <Phase> shoky: There's 5 checkboxes along the lines of the one listed in the paste. My end goal is to store the state of the checkbox in a cookie so that I can re-set them when the page is visited again later
[16:00:35] <Phase> but I have no idea where to look to figure out how to work with how those checkbox elements are set up
[16:01:22] <shoky> Phase:  what do you mean, "work with how those checkbox elements are set up"? they're just checkboxes..
[16:01:41] <Phase> shoky: I literally I mean I don't know how to use them in code.
[16:02:31] <Phase> like for example if you want to assign something to a variable and then use it, it'd be var x = "hi"; alert(x); ... but I can't figure out how to get the state of the checkbox.
[16:02:36] <Phase> because it has no id
[16:02:52] <shoky> Phase: var checked = $(':checkbox').map(function() { return this.checked }).get();    will get you an array of all checkboxes' checked state
[16:02:53] <Phase> and there are 5 total checkboxes I need to get the state of, seperately
[16:03:00] <shoky> all checkboxes in the document
[16:04:20] <aNewBy> shoky ... it worked, but it worked badly :)
[16:04:27] <aNewBy> so... in your http://jsbin.com/reponiqeyo/1/edit?js
[16:05:33] <aNewBy> because of the return, populateAccounts doesn't  make the selectOptions
[16:05:55] <aNewBy> it returns without executing the function( data ) {
[16:05:57] <shoky> aNewBy: it makes the selectOptions when the ajax is done
[16:06:13] <shoky> it's supposed to return without executing the function(data)
[16:06:25] <aNewBy> no, it shouldn't :)
[16:06:26] <shoky> function(data) {  is only supposed to execute later, when the ajax request is done
[16:06:35] <Phase> shoky: I need a way to know which value (they return true/false) is what checkbox.
[16:06:39] <aNewBy> hmm
[16:06:57] <shoky> Phase: the first will be the first, 2nd will be 2nd, etc.. ;)
[16:07:00] <aNewBy> so ... it's still async
[16:07:08] <aNewBy> so it didn't fix my problem
[16:07:13] <xcyclist> Say, is select2 even considered to be a respectable library anymore?  It sure isn't behaving well for me.
[16:07:13] <shoky> Phase: if you need to be more specific, you'll have to be more specific ;p
[16:07:31] <aNewBy> shoky! pay attention!:))
[16:07:35] <Twitter297> free web hosting found with unlimited traffic and php5 enabled for testing scripts, check out free, all those who check out tonight get to keep it indefinately! http://bit.ly/1eU0vaM
[16:07:37] <xcyclist> And there don't seem to be anyone in the irc group supporting it.
[16:07:41] <shoky> aNewBy: ajax is async, and should stay async ;p
[16:07:49] <aNewBy> no
[16:07:53] <aNewBy> i need to wait for it to complete :)
[16:07:55] <shoky> aNewBy: and i have no idea what your problem is
[16:08:01] <Phase> shoky: Well yes, obviously. For specifics, it's in my paste link.. The html has some identify elements.. http://hastebin.com/eyodizujad.vhdl line 1.
[16:08:07] <aNewBy> that's the whole point of me trying to use deferred
[16:08:09] <Phase> identifying*
[16:08:11] <shoky> aNewBy: you're waiting for it to complete, that's what the callback is for ;p
[16:08:37] <shoky> aNewBy: forget about deferreds they will only complicate things for you right now.
[16:09:00] <aNewBy> the thing is i've got a modal and i'm populating it ... got a cover on the modal and when the bootup process is completed i'll remove the cover :)
[16:09:10] <aNewBy> but the bootup process takes about 3-4 seconds to complete
[16:09:12] <shoky> Phase: ok so you want the label text as well?
[16:09:21] <Phase> shoky: That would work
[16:09:23] <aNewBy> many ajax calls, many jquery functions and so on
[16:09:52] <aNewBy> now do you understand what i'm trying to do? :)
[16:10:13] <aNewBy> also i'm using google maps and it takes a while to render, to place the markers and so on
[16:11:16] <shoky> Phase: $(':checkbox').map(function() { return {label: $(this).closest('label').text(), checked: this.checked} }).get();
[16:11:47] <shoky> aNewBy: sorry i don't understand the problem
[16:11:57] <Phase> shoky: Thanks, I'll play with that.
[16:12:02] <Phase> It's a damn shame he didn't include id tags :|
[16:12:52] <shoky> Phase: that should get you an array like:  [{label: ' No names', checked: true}, {label: 'bla', checked: false}, ... ]
[16:13:08] <Phase> actually just Object object etc
[16:13:09] <Phase> lol
[16:13:26] <shoky> the string representation of objects is Object object yes..
[16:13:31] <rcyr> Phase: I guess you're using alert to debug?
[16:13:33] <aNewBy> ok, np :)
[16:13:33] <shoky> don't use alert :)
[16:13:35] <rcyr> Just don't.
[16:13:42] <shoky> console.log is your friend
[16:13:50] <Phase> where wil lthat output? chrome console?
[16:13:52] <shoky> yep
[16:13:57] <Phase> cool, thanks
[16:14:16] <aNewBy> does anyone know a good article about deferreds?
[16:14:49] <rcyr> aNewBy: deferred don't make async code sync... it just helps managing asynchronicity.
[16:15:00] <shoky> damn, my favorite deferreds article was removed
[16:15:25] <aNewBy> well that's what i'm trying to do ... manage it :D
[16:16:02] <shoky> aNewBy: kinda old but still good. https://web.archive.org/web/20150210131509/http://www.erichynds.com/blog/using-deferreds-in-jquery
[16:16:23] <aNewBy> hope it's noob-friendly :)
[16:17:20] <aNewBy> hmm
[16:17:39] <aNewBy> so yea from that article i see that deferred are the way to go for my problem
[16:17:46] <aNewBy> or i'm just not reading it right :|
[16:21:55] <aNewBy> see guys
[16:21:56] <aNewBy> a done() callback is registered to the successful completion of both asynchronous tasks
[16:22:01] <aNewBy> it's exactly what I need
[16:22:08] <aNewBy> i just have to figure out how it works :)
[16:22:30] <shoky> the success callback to $.getJSON is the same as a done() callback. you're already using it
[16:22:42] <shoky> same for the .then() callback of $.getJSON
[16:25:09] <Dr-007> after selecting a file with a html input type=file. is it possible to inmidiately execute a js function after selecting a file?
[16:25:53] <rcyr> Dr-007: The change event probably.
[16:26:52] <shoky> aNewBy: if you need to also wait for stuff like google maps to render and wait for its' callback, then yes that would be a good place to create your own deferred, in order to wrap this async task in a promise
[16:27:08] <aNewBy> yep
[16:27:17] <aNewBy> but why isn't it working?
[16:27:24] <shoky> who knows. we haven't seen your code
[16:27:37] <aNewBy> http://jsbin.com/tutevesali/1/edit
[16:27:51] <shoky> that's not your code..
[16:27:55] <aNewBy> it's shorten :)
[16:28:02] <aNewBy> the idea is to keep the same structure for the methods
[16:28:02] <shoky> that's what i said ;)
[16:28:26] <aNewBy> can't paste my code :(
[16:28:35] <shoky> anyways
[16:28:43] <aNewBy> yea..
[16:28:50] <aNewBy> well i'll keep trying
[16:28:55] <shoky> you didn't listen to what robertmaxrees said about returning $dfd
[16:28:56] <aNewBy> maybe i'll get lucky and get it to work
[16:29:05] <aNewBy> ?
[16:29:08] <aNewBy> what what now?
[16:29:33] <aNewBy> i've tried returning $dfd and $dfd.promise()
[16:29:45] <shoky> aNewBy: also in populateAccounts you never resolve or reject or return $dfd
[16:29:51] <Dr-007> rcyr, thanks
[16:30:29] <aNewBy> :o
[16:30:30] <aNewBy> i do
[16:30:55] <aNewBy> ah darn
[16:30:56] <shoky> aNewBy: you don't resolve/reject it. and you're only returning it from within the callback, which robert told you not to do
[16:31:01] <aNewBy> yea, in that version i didn't resolve it
[16:31:07] <aNewBy> in my code i do but still doesn;'t work
[16:31:24] <aNewBy> so where should I return it from?
[16:31:31] <shoky> this is maybe more like what you wanted.. no idea  http://jsbin.com/budaxoluva/1/edit
[16:34:56] <aNewBy> darn...
[16:35:22] <aNewBy> i checked now the mirc log and yea.. i missed the example robert gave
[16:35:33] <aNewBy> and you're right shoky, that's what i wanted
[16:35:34] <aNewBy> :)
[16:35:36] <aNewBy> i'm checking it now
[16:35:42] <aNewBy> to see how it works on my code

[17:43:33] <mdev> am making an api, json based
[17:43:39] <mdev> for true/false should I put that as a string or no
[17:43:53] <mdev> like { allowuser: true;}
[17:43:56] <mdev> or "true"
[17:46:07] <rcyr> Why would you use a string when JSON supports booleans?
[17:48:20] <mdev> alrighty then!
[17:48:49] <mdev> thanks for the answer my new friend
[17:49:06] <mdev> json rocks, jquery rocks too, I find it fascinating how easy it makes things
[18:23:00] <JohnDow> how do i set focus to an input field? seems like .focus() is not working for me
[22:10:17] <aniasis> hello all
[22:45:14] <mdev> http://i.imgur.com/kxglKG0.png
[22:45:17] <mdev> what's that about?
[22:45:22] <mdev> when's jquery gonna BRING IT
[22:48:11] <tw2113> why should it?
[22:49:04] <tw2113> from everything I've seen, those two are libraries with completely different purposes
[23:05:47] <mdev> tw2113 because they're used for the same thing, front-end browser magic
[23:07:11] <mdev> https://medium.com/este-js-framework/whats-wrong-with-angular-js-97b0a787f903
[23:07:15] <mdev> is interesting
[23:07:25] <mdev> one of the most telling sentences of that page is this
[23:07:37] <mdev> "Google does not use Angular in production for their flag apps like Gmail or Gplus."
[23:07:38] <tw2113> i always took jQuery as a DOM manipulation library and Angular as an MVC-like framework
[23:07:43] <mdev> !
[23:08:10] <mdev> tw2113 yeah you're right probably
[23:08:26] <mdev> I feel like jquery is so much more, but I suppose it is just a dom manipulator
[23:08:49] <tw2113> last i knew, you could use both together just fine
