[01:37:27] <hellyeah> hey
[01:38:06] <hellyeah> do i need to "trim()" method while using text() why there is white spacing. https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/kuqse7sg/10/
[02:14:27] <hellyeah> hey
[02:14:29] <hellyeah> what did i do wrong in line 7 https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/kuqse7sg/11/
[04:52:55] <krad> hi.  i'm using jquery's then method(successCallback, failureCallback).  the issue is when the server returns 201, failureCallback is being invoked instead of successCallback. any idea why?
[04:56:07] <Arghh> hello there... is there anything obviously wrong with the way I'm using this attribute selector?: TypeError: $(...).each(...).$ is not a function
[04:56:10] <Arghh> $("[name='p_n']").each(function(){ prescribed_n_total += $(this).val(); })
[04:57:57] <Arghh> it was originally "td[name='p_n']" but that didn't work either...
[04:59:15] <Arghh> this table has only been in the DOM since a button did a .load(), but this is all happening in the callback function of load() and I've already successfully selected and modified other parts of the table...
[05:03:22] <hollabackatcha> hi, anybody can help with https://bpaste.net/show/71b9c1f0be25 ? i'm thinking $(this) something but not sure
[05:11:12] <Cork> Arghh: no that should work fine, btw you can use $.map instead of each, makes it a bit cleaner
[05:12:05] <Cork> prescribed_n_total = $.map($("[name='p_n']"), function(elm){ return $(this).val(); })
[05:12:15] <Cork> Arghh: btw are you expecting .val() to give you numbers?
[05:12:49] <Cork> kraft: check the arguments to the failure callback, it might be parsing problems
[05:13:07] <Cork> hollabackatcha: please ask the question in the channel and not just a link
[05:13:18] <Cork> (else ppl can't tell if they can answer the question)
[05:13:30] <hollabackatcha> yes i just didn't want to flood with exaplanation
[05:14:07] <Cork> well ya, make the question a short form, but give a hint at to what the question is about
[05:14:45] <Cork> (html, and scripts should still be in a jsfiddle or similar)
[05:15:13] <hollabackatcha> you're right. sorry.. but anyway i found the answer for myself... like this text = $(event.target).closest(this).find('.ccitemtext'); and then text.text(); i'm sure there are better ways than this though.
[05:15:34] <Cork> uh
[05:15:54] <Cork> that is the exact same thing as $(this).find('ccitemtext').text()
[05:16:53] <hollabackatcha> yeah, i figured .. do you know of any better options then using find /closest .. etc ?
[05:17:21] <hollabackatcha> i kinda have a feeling there are better ways to do this
[05:17:39] <Cork> what is the question?
[05:18:21] <Cork> (best is if you make a demo on jsfiddle.net)
[05:22:32] <Arghh> Cork: I did notice val() was wrong for a td, i've switched to Number($(this).text())... but I'm still having this strange problem where .each works if the selector is on it's own but if it's followed by another each the first one complains that each is not a function!?
[05:23:12] <Cork> Arghh: could you make a jsfiddle with a running example of what you're trying to do?
[05:23:26] <Arghh> sure, gimme a minute =)
[05:23:37] <Cork> no rush :)
[05:23:56] <hollabackatcha> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/ohgrwok3/
[05:24:14] <hollabackatcha> i wonder if there's better option to open ccitemtext than using find
[05:24:18] <hollabackatcha> (click on a black box)
[05:25:07] <hollabackatcha> there are many "ccitemtext" fields ... this is just one for example.. so i need to open the one that's been clicked on
[05:26:41] <Cork> hollabackatcha: could you add two entries so one can see where they "duplicate"?
[05:27:09] <Cork> ah, not needed i can work with this
[05:28:16] <hollabackatcha> well you can just duplicate the ccitem div .. as it's all binding on it
[05:30:56] <Cork> dirty hack https://jsfiddle.net/ohgrwok3/2/ ; recommended solution: https://jsfiddle.net/ohgrwok3/3/
[05:33:30] <hollabackatcha> oh, very nice
[05:33:55] <Arghh> Cork: I figured it out as I was writing out the fiddle - no worries, just a typo I'd repeatedly pasted haha... cheers anyway =)
[05:34:10] <hollabackatcha> thanks for that
[05:38:21] <Blinky_> Hi all, could someone please tell me what I am doing wrong here, I just want one set of start and end to show depending on the state of the checkbox - https://jsfiddle.net/yhm306wL/8/
[05:39:54] <Cork> Blinky_: https://jsfiddle.net/yhm306wL/10/
[05:40:35] <Cork> Blinky_: check you're console for errors
[05:44:20] <Blinky_> Cork, it says that is_checked() is not defined, is setting "function is_checked()" not defining it?
[05:45:17] <Cork> Blinky_: in the fiddle?
[05:45:25] <Blinky_> yeah
[05:45:28] <Cork> the fiddle (/10) works just fine here
[05:45:37] <Blinky_> ReferenceError: is_checked is not defined
[05:48:29] <Blinky_> Cork, Getting the same error using firefox, chrome and edge? for you it is changing between the form with one as a placeholder and the form with two?
[05:49:21] <Cork> Blinky_: no there are no event handlers so it only runs on page load
[05:49:41] <Cork> ah, you use event attributes... don't
[05:50:47] <Blinky_> I tried using the toggle to togggle the display to show one and hide the other, problem was the first one never got hidden and the second toggled fine.
[05:54:00] <Cork> Blinky_: https://jsfiddle.net/yhm306wL/17/
[05:54:19] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/yhm306wL/19/ <-- cleaned up
[05:58:15] <Blinky_> Cork, cheers, could I ask you to explain two parts for me please.  first ".toggle(!this.checked)" - how is this hiding and displaying a div and second what is the .call is that to get the state of the checkbox?
[05:59:52] <Xatenev> Heya
[06:00:02] <Xatenev> Im trying to use $('myElement').delay(800).addClass("test"),
[06:00:08] <Xatenev> but the class is appened immediately
[06:09:14] <krad> hi.  does jquery ajax method give you the ability to plug in callbacks that get called in all cases?
[06:30:37] <rndUser> Can't get simple jQuery to work in my HTML file despite trying <script src="jquery-1.12.4.min.js"></script> and also trying to link to Google's CDN and Microsoft's CDN.
[06:38:49] <Tennis> rndUser, what browser are you using ?
[06:39:13] <rndUser> Chrome on Windows
[06:39:39] <Tennis> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/core.js"/></script>
[06:39:50] <Tennis> not that the text/javascript is important just try copy pasta that
[06:39:58] <Tennis> you can look in the console to see if its being included
[06:40:22] <Tennis> if $ is undefined jquery isn't included
[06:42:59] <rndUser> Still doesn't work, here's the jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/cp9q3z4g/
[06:52:43] <Blinky_> https://jsfiddle.net/cp9q3z4g/7/
[06:55:05] <shoky> rndUser: you need more than just the core.js from jquery probably, best link to jquery.min.js  also you can't put your own code in the same <script> that loads a .js file.  needs a separate <script>
[06:57:24] <shoky> also you might want to close that string you're passing to alert() ;p    also don't use alert()
[06:59:26] <rndUser> shoky: Made the updates you suggested, still doesn't work, here's the updated jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/cp9q3z4g/9/
[07:01:16] <shoky> rndUser: what is  $jquery  ;p
[07:01:54] <rndUser> Yes I'm a f****ing noob I know, :(
[07:02:16] <shoky> everybody is at some point
[07:03:01] <shoky> rndUser: you should learn to look at your browser's js console
[07:03:09] <shoky> it would show you these errors
[07:04:00] <shoky> rndUser: also, it shows you that you have an extra )  in your $(document).ready  line
[07:04:19] <shoky> function() {      not   function)()  {
[07:04:20] <shoky> ;p
[07:04:52] <hellyeah> one question
[07:05:41] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/g8par3cd/ i used text() to get text valkue of div but it got whitespace also. For cutting whitespace i used $.trim(). Is there any better suggestion?
[07:06:01] <shoky> i'd just use  .text().trim()
[07:06:36] <shoky> no need for jquery for string manipulation, that's not what it's for
[07:06:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:06:58] <hellyeah> what is the difference?
[07:07:06] <hellyeah> what do you mean with string manipulation?
[07:07:25] <shoky> trimming whitespace from a string, is string manipulation
[07:07:32] <shoky> js is fine at manipulating strings
[07:07:45] <shoky> jquery is a library for DOM manipulation (and ajax..)
[07:08:07] <shoky> why use it for strings when js does it just fine ;p
[07:08:21] <shoky> it doesn't matter - just a personal preference really
[07:08:26] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:08:28] <shoky> i doubt there is a real difference
[07:08:46] <hellyeah> so jquery is for dom and ajax it is actually not jquery's work
[07:08:54] <shoky> pretty much
[07:09:00] <hellyeah> but jquery provide a way for doing that also :D
[07:09:32] <shoky> yep, probably only because of old IE support, and they use it internally i guess
[07:09:35] <hellyeah> i guess i can use textContent
[07:09:50] <shoky> that won't trim anything
[07:09:51] <hellyeah> i could use*
[07:10:12] <hellyeah> trim operation is costy for browser?
[07:10:17] <shoky> nope
[07:10:31] <hellyeah> okey we are fine then ;p
[07:10:44] <shoky> yey
[07:12:22] <rndUser> shoky: i got that jquery code from a book i'm reading and even with the function() {}; syntax changes it still doesn't work
[07:12:59] <shoky> rndUser: not much i can do with "doesn't work"
[07:13:26] <hellyeah> rndUser:  you should fiddle it
[07:13:39] <shoky> did you check your console?
[07:13:45] <hellyeah> rndUser:  do you mean (function(){ ... });
[07:14:00] <rndUser> I did: https://jsfiddle.net/cp9q3z4g/9/
[07:14:22] <shoky> rndUser:  you're still using `$jquery` ...
[07:14:41] <hellyeah> rndUser:  dont use html tag, head tag in jquery it comes to you default
[07:14:42] <shoky> rndUser: stop asking about this problem until you learn to look at your js console
[07:14:54] <shoky> hellyeah means in jsfiddle, not in jquery
[07:15:06] <shoky> but that doesn't matter, you're also asking html questions
[07:15:21] <shoky> so fine to leaev the html there for this learning purpose
[07:16:17] <hellyeah> rndUser:  one problem
[07:16:32] <shoky> rndUser: http://fixingthesejquery.com/   this has info on browser devtools (including console)
[07:16:32] <hellyeah> check your console probably you see $ is not defined
[07:16:48] <shoky> hellyeah: he's using $jquery.. that's definitely undefined ;p
[07:17:06] <hellyeah> :D
[07:17:35] <shoky> rndUser: and you also didn't fix the function)()  thing
[07:17:44] <shoky> or you linked to the wrong fiddle
[07:17:54] <rndUser> Here's the update: https://jsfiddle.net/cp9q3z4g/10/
[07:18:20] <shoky> rndUser: have you checked your console for errors?
[07:19:02] <hellyeah> check line 55 in html
[07:19:08] <rndUser> Here's the error: "(anonymous function)	@	jquery.html:50"
[07:19:09] <hellyeah> there is smt wrong there
[07:19:23] <hellyeah> you will see the problem it is really easy
[07:19:42] <hellyeah> ops
[07:19:43] <shoky> rndUser: that's not the error, is there some error text near that?
[07:19:43] <hellyeah> nvm me
[07:19:54] <rndUser> hellyeah: lol
[07:20:15] <hellyeah> include jquery rndUser
[07:20:23] <rndUser> The error: "jquery.html:50 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined"
[07:20:39] <hellyeah> you see javascript right
[07:20:47] <hellyeah> click that you will see drop down
[07:20:54] <shoky> rndUser:  is there an error above that saying it doesnt find jquery.min.js ?
[07:21:09] <shoky> hellyeah:  he doesn't want to learn how to use jsfiddle
[07:21:12] <shoky> you're just confusing him
[07:21:17] <hellyeah> :D
[07:21:17] <rndUser> Yes: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
[07:21:28] <shoky> rndUser: then you're not including jquery properly.
[07:21:30] <hellyeah> sorry shoky
[07:21:46] <rndUser> You can see how I'm linking it in jsfiddle
[07:21:59] <shoky> rndUser: i can't see that that file really exists in the same folder, can i
[07:22:01] <rndUser> and I've literally copied different link scripts from w3schools
[07:22:10] <shoky> don't copy anything from w3schools :)
[07:22:19] <shoky> in fact, don't copy anything from anywhere
[07:22:23] <shoky> write your own code
[07:22:24] <rndUser> Shouldn't the file just lookup the link online?
[07:22:30] <shoky> learn from lots of places./
[07:22:35] <shoky> rndUser: no..
[07:22:46] <shoky> rndUser: it will look in the same path that you're loading the page from
[07:22:50] <shoky> rndUser: unless you put a full url
[07:22:57] <rndUser> So you're telling me I need to download a file to use jQuery?!
[07:23:05] <shoky> rndUser: you can put a full url if you want to..
[07:23:35] <shoky> (though then you're depending on a 3rd-party for your own site to work)
[07:23:58] <rndUser> Sorry for wasting your time goes, thanks for your help.
[07:24:01] <rndUser> guys*
[07:24:14] <shoky> if you've learned anything then it wasn't wasteful ;p
[07:24:50] <hellyeah> rndUser:  can i give you some tips?
[07:24:56] <hellyeah> about jsfiddle?
[07:25:04] <shoky> lol
[07:25:07] <hellyeah> :D
[07:25:26] <rndUser> hellyeah: Sure, because I am a f****ing noob
[07:26:07] <hellyeah> okey first thing is dont write inline js
[07:26:26] <hellyeah> you see javascript panel in jsfiddle put your code into there
[07:27:05] <hellyeah> second dont use html, body tag in jsfiddle it is useless
[07:27:14] <hellyeah> it is implemented default
[07:27:55] <hellyeah> if you use jquery dont forget to include jquery file you can do it in javascript menu when you click you will see Frameworks and Extensions
[07:28:07] <hellyeah> choose jquery 2.1.3 or whatever you like
[07:28:22] <hellyeah> rndUser:  it is your simple example https://jsfiddle.net/cp9q3z4g/9/
[07:30:54] <rndUser> ty
[07:32:23] <hellyeah> nope
[07:36:05] <Jon_R> I've got a simple question: why on earth doesn't the 'resizable' jqueryui interaction have the iframeFix option like the 'draggable' one does? it needs the exact same fix for the exact same reason, why is it missing?
[08:11:43] <Chulbul> http://pastebin.com/TxZAu8Gq , this code in javascipt is able to read headers when file is created on windows, but when csv is created on mac, it's treating values in second row as headers , and so on.
[08:11:56] <Chulbul> In php, we need to do ini_set("auto_detect_line_endings", "1");
[08:12:02] <Chulbul> How to deal with javascript.
[08:12:41] <Cork> Chulbul: i recommend using the csv parsing lib
[08:12:54] <Cork> http://papaparse.com/
[08:13:09] <Cork> there isn't a line ending detection feature in js
[08:13:18] <Chulbul> But I need a quick fix, is it possible with filereader or not
[08:13:30] <Chulbul> Cork: ohl
[08:13:31] <Cork> the problem isn't with reader
[08:13:33] <Chulbul> ohk
[08:13:39] <Cork> the problem is with .split("\n")
[08:14:21] <Cork> though \n should work for both
[08:14:22] <Chulbul> oh, \r is needed
[08:14:28] <Cork> no
[08:14:32] <Cork> it isn't as simple as that
[08:14:43] <Cork> \r\n is windows \n is linux and \r is mac
[08:15:07] <Cork> well rather unix based (but not mac is \n)
[08:15:31] <Chulbul> so last option is http://papaparse.com/ Cork
[08:15:45] <Cork> it is my recommendation
[08:16:19] <Cork> but you could do e.target.result.match(/\n\r/), e.target.result.match(/\n/), e.target.result.match(/\r/)
[08:16:29] <Chulbul> hmm ok, got it Cork thank you.
[08:16:34] <Cork> and store that as \r\n, \n, \r
[08:16:41] <Cork> and use that in the split
[08:16:47] <Chulbul> oh ok
[08:17:54] <Cork> but ya, csv has a lot of other peculiarities you don't handle there
[08:18:09] <Cork> so i would still recommend papaparse
[08:24:17] <Jon_R> anyone know the answer to my question about why jqueryui resizable doesn't have iframefix like draggable does? ;-)
[08:39:31] <arnas> hello
[08:39:44] <arnas> does anyone know how can I let user input only numbers using jquery mask plugin?
[08:40:31] <Cork> arnas: /\d/
[08:40:41] <Cork> though i would recommend not preventing input
[08:40:55] <arnas> Cork, can I use it in data-mask attribute?
[08:40:56] <arnas> why not?
[08:40:58] <Cork> as it can be very annoying for the user (ex if they need to paste a source that has a space in the number)
[08:41:18] <Cork> better is to validate the results and show a validation error
[08:41:29] <Cork> leaves the user in control
[08:41:32] <arnas> Cork, well, I have to follow projects' specification
[08:41:42] <Cork> ugg...
[08:41:59] <arnas> btw your method didn't work
[08:41:59] <Cork> an access reimplementation on the web it sounds like...
[08:42:16] <Cork> i don't use the plugin so i don't know what options it takes
[08:42:21] <arnas> I doesn't work with data-mask attribute
[08:42:24] <Cork> \d matches digits in regex
[08:42:24] <arnas> https://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/
[08:42:59] <Cork> check the field option section
[08:43:26] <jak2000> where download affix ?  i try google but not luck
[08:43:31] <arnas> Cork, yea, but I suppose it should be doable via data-mask attribute, too :/
[08:44:00] <Cork> arnas: if you absolutely have to do it through the attribute i suggest you read the plugin source code and see what it does with the attribute
[08:44:08] <Cork> jak2000: affix?
[08:44:11] <arnas> Cork, okay, thanks :)
[08:44:37] <IamTrying> http://i.stack.imgur.com/YKsjn.png - Google Chrome new Virus, how to remove that Virus?
[08:45:26] <Cork> IamTrying: offtopic for this channel => #google
[08:45:54] <IamTrying> OK
[08:57:43] <Jon_R> ok, different question: does anyone know how I can prevent all navigation?
[08:58:57] <Dan39> prevent navigation? like what navigation? o_O
[08:59:12] <Jon_R> prevent the browser navigating to another URL
[08:59:15] <Dan39> like stop back/forward from working? or scrolling?
[08:59:16] <Cork> Jon_R: you can't
[08:59:34] <Cork> websites isn't trusted with that power as sites can be hostile
[08:59:39] <Jon_R> stop back/forward, stop links being clicked, stop javascript doing window.location="foo", etc
[08:59:42] <Dan39> yea i imagine that would be exploited pretty badly
[09:00:18] <Dan39> Jon_R: i imagine you could do some of those things manually
[09:00:25] <Cork> you might find a bug where it is possible to get it working, but it is just a matter of time until that bug will be fixed (and it defenitely isn't cross browser)
[09:01:04] <BulleTTime> hi there
[09:01:21] <BulleTTime> anyone knows why jquery swipe is so laggy on my android device?
[09:01:28] <Jon_R> i could delete window.location from the window object maybe?
[09:01:51] <Cork> Jon_R: no cause it isn't a js object
[09:01:59] <Cork> it is a binding into the browser code
[09:02:02] <Cork> you can't remove it
[09:02:27] <Cork> Jon_R: just drop the idea it isn't a way forward
[09:02:57] <Jon_R> it's not optional, i'll have to bodge something if necessary I guess
[09:03:26] <momomo> i am getting this data : { search : { input : input.val() } } .. as search=[object Object] when doing an ajax call
[09:03:30] <Cork> Jon_R: the only option you have is to make what ever breaks if the user leaves not break
[09:03:32] <Jon_R> it's in an iframe so my outer window will still have code running even if the iframe navigates away
[09:03:52] <momomo> do I need to manually JSON.stringify ?
[09:04:03] <momomo> i have tried setting dataType and contentType but still the same
[09:04:31] <Cork> momomo: sounds like you're either disabled the params parsing
[09:04:39] <Cork> or you concat it with a string somewhere
[09:05:31] <momomo> Cork, yes, that might be true .. traditional is on
[09:05:49] <Cork> traditional?
[09:06:13] <Cork> just do $.ajax(url, { data: { input: input.val() } })
[09:06:29] <Cork> it should give you ?search[input]=something
[09:06:46] <momomo> yes, but not if traditional=true
[09:06:56] <Cork> i have no clue what that means
[09:06:57] <momomo> by server can't parse that anyway
[09:07:05] <momomo> "disabled the params parsing"
[09:07:14] <momomo> it's a flag for jquery i think
[09:07:17] <Cork> that isn't traditional
[09:07:38] <momomo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5497093/what-is-traditional-style-of-param-serialization-in-jquery
[09:07:46] <Cork> { processData: false } is the option i talked about
[09:08:11] <Cork> ah, that old setting
[09:08:18] <Cork> not even sure if that is supported anymore...
[09:08:34] <Cork> wait no
[09:08:40] <Cork> traditional isn't a dependency
[09:08:52] <Cork> it should still handle the object
[09:09:00] <Cork> only difference is if you get a [] or not
[09:11:21] <momomo> there is no way i think in the old specification to handle objects
[09:11:23] <momomo> arrays yes
[09:11:48] <momomo> a: [1,2,3] -> a=1&a=2&b=3
[09:11:51] <momomo> a: [1,2,3] -> a=1&a=2&c=3
[09:11:59] <momomo> i am too tired
[09:13:14] <Cork> hmm ya, it appears you're correct
[09:13:23] <Cork> you have to send it as flat keys
[09:13:35] <Cork> if the server support nested keys you don't need traditional
[09:13:44] <momomo> no .. it doesnt
[09:13:51] <momomo> that's why i think i turned it off long ago
[09:13:53] <Cork> then you can't send that object to start with
[09:47:38] <BulleTTime> hi
[09:48:13] <BulleTTime> anyone can explain why a simple image swipe slider (fullscreen) is mega slow on tablets/mobile ?
[09:48:35] <BulleTTime> when i scale it to like 50% of the page the animations work okay
[09:48:53] <BulleTTime> why such a big performance impact?
[10:00:40] <BulleTTime> everyone sleeping:P ?
[10:00:54] <BulleTTime> can this possible fix my issue:
[10:00:55] <BulleTTime> https://github.com/gnarf/jquery-requestAnimationFrame
[10:01:02] <BulleTTime> ?
[10:08:44] <lulul> guys i'm trying to do a foreach loop with jquery to get for each table row some data that is parsed as data-attribute but i didn't quite manage getting there can you help me out please ? https://jsfiddle.net/ufd9tm93/
[10:15:35] <taplar> lulul: either pass in the element on the each or use 'this' instead of looking it up again
[10:18:34] <taplar> this is really strange, you got other issues going on
[10:18:44] <taplar> your step is a child of your question it looks like, but your using closest()
[10:19:05] <taplar> and your step does not have a data-id on it
[10:19:15] <taplar> looks like a button does
[10:20:21] <taplar> so look at those things, :)
[10:27:37] <BulleTTime> anyone: is requestAnimationFrame implemented in jquery?
[10:35:24] <Brodingo> BulleTTime https://github.com/jquery/jquery/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=requestanimationframe
[11:56:57] <BulleTTime> guys, ive been asking around all day: why is jquery / swipe so bad in performance on touch devices?
[11:57:26] <robertmaxrees> "jquery / swipe"?
[11:57:29] <robertmaxrees> mind clarifying?
[12:07:20] <taplar> must not be important
[12:09:39] <bomb> BulleTTime: What kind of performance issues you're seeing?
[12:10:58] <BulleTTime> bomb basically i use this example:
[12:10:59] <BulleTTime> http://stephen.band/jquery.event.swipe/
[12:11:08] <BulleTTime> with some other content..
[12:11:23] <robertmaxrees> so that example doesn't perform poorly, but your version does?
[12:11:32] <BulleTTime> but it realy impacts the sliding performance on touch devices
[12:12:04] <robertmaxrees> it's probably because the page is doing some weird recalculating of stuff.
[12:12:06] <bomb> BulleTTime: It's still not clear. The animation has low framerate, or touching event is not responsive enough, or what?
[12:12:15] <BulleTTime> well
[12:12:30] <robertmaxrees> also: have you profiled it?
[12:12:52] <BulleTTime> well
[12:12:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:13:07] <taplar> seems fine on my phone
[12:13:13] <BulleTTime> okay
[12:13:32] <BulleTTime> ill quickly upload an example, with the image fullscreen
[12:13:35] <robertmaxrees> taplar he noted that the issues he was seeing was on a different page he'd buold :)
[12:13:36] <bomb> Yeah.
[12:13:36] <BulleTTime> or
[12:13:43] <bomb> You're straight out lying BulleTTime
[12:13:49] <taplar> :o
[12:13:52] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:13:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't think he's lying.
[12:13:57] <BulleTTime> wait
[12:14:06] <BulleTTime> the example is working <<
[12:14:10] <BulleTTime> (the url)
[12:14:18] <robertmaxrees> probably just confused about where things are broken.
[12:14:19] <BulleTTime> but my version of it aint
[12:14:24] <BulleTTime> well
[12:14:33] <taplar> ya, i was just offering the point
[12:14:38] <taplar> so... where's the bad one?
[12:14:54] <bomb> Mind sharing your precious code so we can have a look at it?
[12:15:07] <taplar> lol, bomb's a little snarky today
[12:15:08] <BulleTTime> ive got (instead of the images) some simple div with text and image with a screen with of 100% and like 500px height..
[12:15:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, make a fiddle or something.
[12:15:20] <robertmaxrees> and/or profile it.
[12:15:33] <BulleTTime> so whenever the ¨slide¨ is big, it makes a huge performance impact
[12:15:41] <BulleTTime> okay
[12:15:58] <BulleTTime> what devices u guys have?
[12:16:11] <taplar> galaxy s
[12:16:14] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you need to just profile it.
[12:16:21] <BulleTTime> ive been testing on a galaxy tab 4 and another crappy android 4.0 tablet
[12:16:24] <BulleTTime> same result
[12:16:57] <BulleTTime> robertmaxrees what u mean with ¨profile¨ ?
[12:17:19] <taplar> "taplar: so... where's the bad one? "
[12:17:29] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[12:17:43] <robertmaxrees> also: your browser has a bunch of tools built-in to look at where your performance issues are.
[12:18:01] <BulleTTime> yeah but not my mobile ones
[12:18:10] <BulleTTime> desktop runs smoothly:P
[12:18:12] <robertmaxrees> actually... ;) but share out a version we can see.
[12:18:16] <taplar> lol
[12:18:26] <taplar> so many teeth on the floor
[12:18:30] <BulleTTime> but, anyone got tablet?
[12:18:37] <BulleTTime> working on it now
[12:18:51] <robertmaxrees> just share it out mang.
[12:19:10] <robertmaxrees> there's a good chance we can see what's causing the perf issues even on a desktop device.
[12:19:18] <robertmaxrees> like, there's some obvious stuff we can look for.
[12:19:56] <krad> hi.  does ajaxSetup dataFilter get called on every ajax call?
[12:20:27] <robertmaxrees> krad from the docs for ajaxSetup - "Set default values for future Ajax requests. Its use is not recommended."
[12:22:59] <krad> robertmaxrees, i want a callback that gets invoked for every ajax response, so i thought about ajaxSetup.dataFilter
[12:23:12] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that.
[12:23:30] <robertmaxrees> dataFilter is specifically for filtering data.
[12:23:38] <robertmaxrees> why not just register normally via .then() ?
[12:23:49] <krad> because i want to do this in a central place
[12:23:54] <krad> not then for all ajax calls i have
[12:24:25] <robertmaxrees> it's generally recommended that you don't do that, but if you really feel you need to, you'll want the success option.
[12:24:57] <robertmaxrees> jQuery.ajaxSetup({success: function(data) {} });
[12:25:19] <krad> well.  i want to track unauthorized server http responses
[12:25:29] <krad> so i redirect the user to the login page
[12:25:32] <robertmaxrees> that should be done via your server.
[12:25:49] <krad> server will not redirect, will send 401 to client
[12:25:58] <robertmaxrees> it should ensure the user is logged in and, if not, the response should error out and then your ajax call redirects.
[12:26:09] <krad> yes, ajax call redirects
[12:26:21] <krad> so i assume there's a failure function
[12:26:29] <robertmaxrees> .then(success, fail);
[12:26:34] <robertmaxrees> second arg to then.
[12:26:47] <krad> that's for ajaxSetup
[12:26:48] <krad> ?
[12:26:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:26:53] <robertmaxrees> for the normal calls.
[12:27:08] <krad> no.  i want to do this for all calls
[12:27:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:27:14] <krad> in one central place
[12:27:33] <robertmaxrees> even the docs say you shouldn't do that, but there are success and error callbacks availabl.
[12:27:36] <robertmaxrees> *available
[12:27:39] <krad> ok
[12:27:47] <robertmaxrees> but i'd really rethink that approach.
[12:27:55] <krad> why?
[12:28:17] <robertmaxrees> you're basically forcing buy-in to that, but if anything else on the page wants to use $.ajax() for anything else (protip: that'll happen), then you're coding yourself into a corner.
[12:29:26] <krad> robertmaxrees, no
[12:29:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:29:35] <krad> these calls won't be affected
[12:29:43] <krad> because server won't check for authentication for them
[12:29:46] <krad> you lose again
[12:29:48] <krad> :P
[12:29:55] <robertmaxrees> "hey here's my experience with doing this sort of stuff - i'd suggest not doing it at all and going another route"
[12:30:05] <robertmaxrees> "nah you're wrong"
[12:30:06] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:30:08] <robertmaxrees> enjoy i guess.
[12:30:13] <krad> prove me wrong?
[12:30:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:30:22] <robertmaxrees> enjoy man.
[12:30:29] <krad> salsa
[12:37:20] <sagerdearia> How come when adding input textboxes to a page, they have different height size than other textboxes? There are no CSS rules that I see that are causing this.
[12:37:49] * taplar peers into his crystal ball...
[12:37:56] * robertmaxrees joins taplar
[12:37:57] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[12:38:10] <robertmaxrees> is says something about css.
[12:38:34] <taplar> strange, i saw show example from my side
[12:38:40] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[12:38:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:38:52] <BulleTTime> okay so just
[12:39:20] <BulleTTime> visit the site im working on : http://plasticsoupsurfer.org
[12:39:47] <robertmaxrees> slowww
[12:39:58] <BulleTTime> yeah, no cache yet:)
[12:40:08] <robertmaxrees> even scroll performance is slow.
[12:40:21] <BulleTTime> on desktop?
[12:40:24] <robertmaxrees> si
[12:40:25] <taplar> what's this error not found in the console?
[12:41:05] <sagerdearia> pic: http://i.imgur.com/fGJEyUH.png
[12:41:09] <BulleTTime> yeah there are two errors, from iframes (vimeo and donate)
[12:41:24] <BulleTTime> plus an simple img resource error
[12:41:28] <robertmaxrees> sagerdearia that's not helpful.
[12:41:31] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[12:41:38] <robertmaxrees> or otherwise show us.
[12:41:50] <BulleTTime> plus some playground ajax counter :b
[12:41:56] <taplar> hard to copy paste that url, :(
[12:42:51] <taplar> but just a quick look, one of those inputs has display block on it
[12:43:07] <BulleTTime> so why cant i add js/css to fiddle without using https links?
[12:43:15] <sagerdearia> taplar, yeah, I've been tinkering with it
[12:43:27] <robertmaxrees> BulleTTime because it serves over http
[12:43:29] <sillyslux> sagerdearia, class="hdden"?
[12:43:29] <robertmaxrees> *https
[12:43:51] <z1haze_work> is there any way to just force the dom to update?
[12:43:53] <sagerdearia> sillyslux, yes, manually removed the i in hidden
[12:43:58] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work wut
[12:44:00] <sillyslux> :D
[12:44:00] <NTrash> How do you link jquery to a javascript file?
[12:44:06] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work it updates when it needs to.
[12:44:10] <robertmaxrees> NTrash you... don't?
[12:44:14] <robertmaxrees> you just load it before your code.
[12:44:14] <z1haze_work> not in my case
[12:44:21] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work then you have another problem.
[12:44:27] <z1haze_work> not really
[12:44:34] <robertmaxrees> srs
[12:44:40] <robertmaxrees> wtf is it with people today
[12:44:42] <z1haze_work> im loading images inside <li> and sometimes they are rendering with 0 width
[12:44:46] <taplar> NTrash: you don't link files.  you include jquery on the page before the other script
[12:44:56] <z1haze_work> if i go insto dev toos and modify ANY css it updates correctly
[12:45:10] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work that usually means you have a bug in your css or html.
[12:45:29] <NTrash> robertmaxrees: i wanna write a crapload of jquery code to style my webpages. Can i not just link my pages to a jquery.js file?
[12:45:30] <BulleTTime> okay so ill just put an example on my shared host, will be back later
[12:45:32] <z1haze_work> weird..
[12:45:45] <z1haze_work> all i do is uncheck/recheck ANY css property and its fine robertmaxrees
[12:45:46] <robertmaxrees> NTrash uh
[12:45:54] <robertmaxrees> NTrash why would you want to use JS for styling?
[12:46:00] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work right.
[12:46:09] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work usually means you've got some invalid markup or CSS.
[12:46:15] <z1haze_work> ah
[12:46:17] <z1haze_work> never knew this
[12:46:18] <NTrash> i wanna use css for styling using jquery
[12:46:23] <taplar> why?
[12:46:36] <z1haze_work> well good freaking luck to me trying to find it, tons of people have had their hands in this and the files are huge
[12:46:50] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work no reason to get rude about it.
[12:47:02] <z1haze_work> O.o im not being rude
[12:47:13] <robertmaxrees> heh that came off a little angry.
[12:47:14] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:47:14] <z1haze_work> that wasnt aimed at anyone
[12:47:18] <NTrash> Is there a way to include the jquery library in a JS file?
[12:47:22] <z1haze_work> i can be angry and not be rude
[12:47:24] <robertmaxrees> NTrash again, no.
[12:47:43] <z1haze_work> but yea, its aggravting of course, again though wasnt geared toward anyone
[12:47:43] <robertmaxrees> NTrash you load it onto the page before your other code.
[12:47:46] <NTrash> so must all the jquery code by in the html page -..-
[12:47:55] <taplar> no...
[12:48:01] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:48:04] <taplar> include before, we've said that atleast twice
[12:48:06] <robertmaxrees> you can use a script tag to load the lib instea.d
[12:48:11] <sillyslux> uh can't you do something like $=require('jquery')?
[12:48:17] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could use requirejs or something similar to load it.
[12:48:38] <z1haze_work> so robertmaxrees this css blunder youre guessing is the issue, it would/should be related to these components in particular or could be anyone in the entire applications css
[12:49:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work sure.  normally it just takes looking through the styles on the element and parent elements and making sure everything is copascetic.
[12:49:33] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux you could use require or another framework for that,s ure.
[12:49:43] <z1haze_work> well in that case i can safely say thats not the issue at hand
[12:49:48] <z1haze_work> well, almost safely
[12:49:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:49:54] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[12:49:59] <robertmaxrees> y'all are killing me today
[12:50:02] <z1haze_work> haha
[12:50:09] <sillyslux> hehe
[12:50:09] <z1haze_work> pleasures of this 'job'
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> folks just wanna be right - don't wanna listen to no advice.
[12:50:52] <sillyslux> ah there's worse
[12:51:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm just overly tired today.
[12:51:06] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: that isnt it dude, you were just throwing out a guess
[12:51:11] <Uhkis> cue arguing on the internet pic
[12:51:12] <z1haze_work> without even seeing it
[12:51:33] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work literally every time i've seen that bug, it's due to invalid css or html.
[12:51:52] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) but my experience means nothing soooo... ;)
[12:51:59] <z1haze_work> lol
[12:52:08] <z1haze_work> it does
[12:52:14] <robertmaxrees> cool bruh
[12:52:15] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[12:52:41] <z1haze_work> im just saying i have no errors in my css lint
[12:53:23] <z1haze_work> woudl you at least look at it?
[12:53:41] <z1haze_work> it seems to be a loading issue
[12:53:54] <taplar> are you putting a css width on the images?
[12:53:55] <z1haze_work> because on production it doesnt happen
[12:53:59] <z1haze_work> no
[12:54:03] <taplar> hmm
[12:54:09] <z1haze_work> because i dont know the width
[12:54:39] <z1haze_work> http://bit.ly/2ctjIDn i shortened the link because this irc client wont let me put a long link in here
[12:54:46] <taplar> sure, just asking in case you were trying something like detecting the width, but it was maybe running before it loaded.  *keeps eating lunch*
[12:55:18] <z1haze_work> previously the solution was to iterate through all of them and call load then set the parent to the width of the image
[12:55:30] <z1haze_work> i just figured theres a better way
[12:55:58] <taplar> which images on this page are erroring
[12:56:10] <z1haze_work> the swatches, middle right
[12:56:26] <z1haze_work> some load in, some get squished
[12:56:58] <taplar> are you preloading the swatches?
[12:57:12] <z1haze_work> no
[12:57:23] <taplar> might help with some of the flickering
[12:57:40] <z1haze_work> are you not seeing them squished?
[12:57:51] <z1haze_work> https://gyazo.com/b6d9585238489d97766f43366be7b909
[12:58:01] <z1haze_work> every page load they change a bit though
[12:58:05] <z1haze_work> sometimes better than others
[12:58:23] <z1haze_work> like wow i just refreshed and it was fine 100%
[12:58:52] <taplar> i see them all
[12:58:58] <z1haze_work> refresh a couple times
[12:59:09] <z1haze_work> might have had a good load
[13:00:21] <taplar> 4-5 loads they showed up fine
[13:00:25] <z1haze_work> ffs
[13:00:31] <z1haze_work> oh you mean 4 out of 5?
[13:00:34] <taplar> one time though the whole page didn't load
[13:00:44] <taplar> strange power button like thing in the top left showed up
[13:01:27] <z1haze_work> probably some svg
[13:01:31] <z1haze_work> who knows
[13:01:48] <taplar> yeah, they are always showing up, and that power icon thing is always there
[13:01:51] <z1haze_work> so should i iterate through and load them all because displaying that div?
[13:02:04] <z1haze_work> can yo uscreen shot it? thats weird i havent seen that
[13:02:06] <z1haze_work> ohhh
[13:02:08] <z1haze_work> lol
[13:02:12] <z1haze_work> thats the development toolkit
[13:02:18] <z1haze_work> thats not part of the site
[13:02:25] <taplar> k
[13:02:52] <z1haze_work> so you are definitely seeing all watches
[13:02:58] <z1haze_work> swatches*
[13:03:03] <taplar> yep, i see no scruntching like you linked with that pic
[13:03:16] <taplar> browser?
[13:03:20] <z1haze_work> my latest refresh gives me this https://gyazo.com/e544f0417afb0990d0a723840bd756be
[13:03:28] <z1haze_work> its weird
[13:03:31] <z1haze_work> chrome
[13:03:36] <taplar> let me switch
[13:04:08] <z1haze_work> im trying in ff now and ew i see some ugly black lines
[13:04:55] <taplar> there, i see it
[13:05:04] <taplar> but i only saw it in chrome
[13:05:05] <z1haze_work> were you in firefox before?
[13:05:15] <taplar> yep
[13:05:27] <z1haze_work> do you see the nasty black lines around the main slide image?
[13:05:43] <taplar> i saw a black line around the right side of the large image some times
[13:06:28] <z1haze_work> these lines https://gyazo.com/1609b03088c58d4082a8e367a60253b4
[13:06:43] <taplar> yep, dunno that i noticed the bottom one though
[13:06:49] <z1haze_work> thats weird
[13:06:54] <z1haze_work> no css to explain it
[13:09:14] <z1haze_work> thoughts on that? or either one of those issues? haha
[13:10:09] <taplar> it looks like the image is there, just the other images are stacking on top of them
[13:10:19] <taplar> or are being pushed out of an overlay
[13:12:08] <taplar> there's a position relative on the li's but i don't see any top or left rules
[13:13:12] <taplar> for shiggles, try taking that off
[13:13:54] <taplar> application.css "ul.swatches.Color li"
[13:16:16] <z1haze_work> gotta find where that actually is
[13:17:12] <z1haze_work> im not even seeing a relative position on the li
[13:17:15] <taplar> ruffle ln 8313
[13:17:55] <z1haze_work> i see it in dev tools though
[13:17:58] <z1haze_work> ugh i hate the way this is organized
[13:18:21] <taplar> this is why i'm learning to love less, :)
[13:18:42] <taplar> the language, not just as a general statement
[13:19:06] <z1haze_work> we use scss
[13:19:24] <z1haze_work> but the sourcemap is apparently not working
[13:20:20] <z1haze_work> found it taplar its been removed
[13:20:28] <taplar> lets see
[13:21:11] <taplar> still issues, though this one is actually only the width that is displayed
[13:23:02] <z1haze_work> what do you mean?
[13:23:02] <taplar> ohhh
[13:23:08] <taplar> ok, now
[13:23:31] <taplar> your "ul.swatches.Color li a" has overflow: hidden
[13:24:01] <taplar> try commenting that out
[13:24:29] <taplar> it also has a text-indent of -999em; :s
[13:24:38] <z1haze_work> heh
[13:24:39] <z1haze_work> old school
[13:24:48] <z1haze_work> i didnt do that
[13:25:07] <z1haze_work> ah i see why it had position relative and why it has overflow hidden
[13:25:18] <z1haze_work> refresh you wil doo
[13:25:22] <z1haze_work> too*
[13:25:45] <z1haze_work> well its not as bad on this one
[13:26:05] <taplar> 5 good reloads
[13:26:06] <z1haze_work> but the relative position is for the items that are out of stock
[13:26:09] <taplar> what am i looking for?
[13:26:19] <z1haze_work> there is an span that is overlayed showing its unavailable
[13:26:27] <taplar> ah
[13:26:28] <z1haze_work> thats why the realtive position was there
[13:26:38] <z1haze_work> and the overflow is because the other items have round swatches
[13:26:44] <z1haze_work> and the images were square
[13:26:59] <taplar> well it definitely seems the overflow hidden was biting you
[13:27:02] <z1haze_work> https://gyazo.com/f92be091cea453c7baf620b8df34241a
[13:27:07] <z1haze_work> hmm
[13:27:36] <taplar> if your going to do overflow hidden, you may have to logically set the width of the a to match the images width
[13:27:39] <z1haze_work> you can see this one the negative effects http://bit.ly/2cXx8VP
[13:27:47] <taplar> but if you do that.... why have it, ya know? heh
[13:27:50] <z1haze_work> so basically my earlier solution is my only way?
[13:28:15] <z1haze_work> because it only seems to happen on the items that dont have round swatches
[13:28:40] <taplar> heh, i wouldn't say only way.  this is just us tinkering.  you might try ##css and maybe a css guru in there will have an idea or something
[13:28:52] <z1haze_work> yea i may
[13:28:54] <z1haze_work> thank you
[13:28:59] <taplar> np
[13:30:12] <taplar> mmm, bourbon chicken....
[13:35:39] <taplar> as for that border on the image, i'm not seeing it in the rules.  i'm trying to see if it's actually apart of the picture
[13:36:13] <taplar> nope
[13:36:15] <taplar> hmm
[13:37:50] <z1haze_work> strange one
[13:40:34] <taplar> ah!
[13:40:44] <taplar> the surrounding div has a background-color of black
[13:41:44] <taplar> or transparent or something
[13:41:58] <taplar> anyway, putting a background color of white on it made it go away, though the white made it look funky
[13:42:13] <taplar> but, a pointer, :)
[13:44:07] <z1haze_work> taplar: i think i solved the swatch loading issue - care to take another peak?
[13:44:19] <taplar> :O how dare you!
[13:44:20] <taplar> sure
[13:44:46] <z1haze_work> by solve i mean bandaid
[13:44:58] <z1haze_work> but i dont think its terrible
[13:45:03] <taplar> 5 good loads in chrome
[13:45:07] <z1haze_work> sweet
[13:45:36] <z1haze_work> http://dpaste.com/120NJ0W i hide it until imagesLoaded is true.. think of a cleaner way?
[13:47:43] <taplar> not right now.  seems fine
[13:48:34] <taplar> i dunno if there is a way to get a deferred for a load or not
[13:49:01] <taplar> if there was you could possibly do something with $.when
[13:49:20] <taplar> but as you said, that works, :)
[13:51:19] <taplar> personally i also think it looks better revealing them all at once, instead of letting them trickle in
[13:52:40] <z1haze_work> you mean instead of keeping the counter?
[13:53:07] <taplar> no no, i mean as it was, images would each show one at a time as they loaded.  now it's all of them at once
[13:53:20] <z1haze_work> yea
[13:53:28] <z1haze_work> i was referring to the $when
[13:53:49] <taplar> oh, ya, if you could do deferred instead of the counter might be safer
[13:54:11] <taplar> since your kinda sharing that one variable between all the loads
[13:54:33] <z1haze_work> it lonly loads once
[13:54:45] <z1haze_work> check the network tab
[13:55:27] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[13:55:44] <taplar> your attaching an event handler to every element
[13:56:14] <z1haze_work> ah right
[13:56:19] <z1haze_work> what would be a scenario this could break?
[13:56:31] <z1haze_work> if the image 404'd?
[13:56:34] <taplar> i dunno, event handling is async-ish
[13:56:42] <taplar> i may be over thinking it
[13:57:04] <z1haze_work> anyway you mentioned you figured out a answer for that black bar thing in ff?
[13:57:28] <taplar> yeah, the div around it, if you give it a background-color it seems to replace the black border
[13:57:28] <z1haze_work> im not even seeing it now
[13:57:29] <z1haze_work> are you?
[13:57:36] <z1haze_work> ah nvm
[13:57:39] <z1haze_work> there it is
[13:57:46] <taplar> yep
[13:58:04] <z1haze_work> which div?
[13:58:23] <z1haze_work> the unnamed div?
[13:58:30] <taplar> the immediate parent to the <a><img></img></a>
[13:58:30] <z1haze_work> right inside product-image-container?
[13:58:33] <z1haze_work> ohh
[13:58:56] <z1haze_work> i have no <a>
[13:58:57] <taplar> err, wait
[13:59:50] <taplar> crap i had found it earlier
[14:00:24] <al_nz1> why would this event fire perfectly in fiddle but do nothing on my PC - https://jsfiddle.net/qpdxnr68/
[14:01:15] <PlanC> you probably haven't added jquery
[14:01:53] <z1haze_work> im adding a transparent background to everything in the vicinity, no changes lol
[14:02:18] <al_nz1> PlanC: I have
[14:02:22] <PlanC> al_nz1: I see now that jquery is actually in the HTML
[14:02:32] <PlanC> al_nz1: do you get any errors in the console?
[14:02:46] <al_nz1> no
[14:03:06] <taplar> z1haze_work: ah, .owl-item > .item
[14:03:35] <PlanC> al_nz1: that doesn't make any sense
[14:03:39] <PlanC> where are you adding the script?
[14:03:39] <taplar> if you give the div with class item a background-color the black border goes away, but messes up other stuff
[14:04:47] <taplar> al_nz1: i assume by doing it on your pc you mean sticking it in an html file and just opening it up?
[14:04:49] <al_nz1> PlanC: its a external script loaded at the very bottom of the html file
[14:05:01] <al_nz1> taplar: yes - localhost
[14:05:14] <z1haze_work> hmm im not seeing a change
[14:05:15] <taplar> any console errors?
[14:05:25] <al_nz1> taplar: no
[14:05:30] <al_nz1> its bizare
[14:06:05] <taplar> and the network tab shows all the files load with 200s or 304s?
[14:06:05] <al_nz1> I have a alert telling the javascript file is loading
[14:07:27] <PlanC> al_nz1: mind inlining the jquery part and pasting the entire html file on pastebin?
[14:07:57] <al_nz1> PlanC: sure
[14:08:04] <taplar> if all the files are loading, the only thing i can think of is your putting your binding in your file before your markup
[14:10:13] <z1haze_work> to taplar i put a background-color: #f5f5f5 on it, changed nothing
[14:10:22] <z1haze_work> the parent doesnt even havea black background on it lol
[14:10:33] <taplar> really?  i put a bg on it and it goes away
[14:11:13] <al_nz1> ok here is the whole thing : http://pastebin.com/Du5PmEjY
[14:11:22] <al_nz1> the external file is at the bottom too
[14:11:46] <PlanC> where is that part loaded though?
[14:12:01] <al_nz1> about two lines from the bottom of the html
[14:12:06] <al_nz1> its pol1310.js
[14:12:06] <PlanC> pol1310.js?
[14:13:11] <PlanC> well I got the console error right off the bat
[14:13:29] <sillyslux> al_nz1 you could put a debugger statement right before that code as in https://jsfiddle.net/qpdxnr68/2/ and open your devtools, when it breaks type $("#ipv-question1.selectpicker") in the js console and see if there are any such elements present when the code is executed
[14:13:45] <PlanC> no need for that
[14:13:54] <PlanC> he hasn't checked the console
[14:13:58] <PlanC> $('.textarea').wysiwyg();
[14:14:05] <PlanC> remove that line and you'll see that it'll work
[14:14:18] <al_nz1> PlanC: I did check console....
[14:14:38] <taplar> wait, that that pastebin verbatum what the html file is?
[14:14:40] <z1haze_work> i wonder if its some weird firefox property
[14:14:42] <taplar> *is that
[14:14:44] <PlanC> al_nz1, well unless you're using netscape 2.0 it should give you the error
[14:15:44] <taplar> oh, nvm
[14:15:53] <al_nz1> PlanC: standby
[14:16:28] <PlanC> al_nz1, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwZNL7QVJjE

[14:16:55] <al_nz1> https://snag.gy/80iNke.jpg
[14:17:58] <al_nz1> no console error there?
[14:18:52] <PlanC> are you sure that you have the console open BEFORE you open the page?
[14:19:48] <al_nz1> I have the console open with the page open, and the hit CTRL-F5
[14:19:54] <al_nz1> *Then
[14:20:08] <al_nz1> nothing comes up after the reload
[14:20:25] <al_nz1> except that googlemaps one
[14:21:08] <PlanC> strange
[14:21:22] <PlanC> I'm seeing the error perfectly from here
[14:21:42] <PlanC> but removing that wysiwyg line solved the problem, right?
[14:21:54] <al_nz1> even if I remove that textarea wysiwyg didnt fix!
[14:22:27] <al_nz1> I can screen share if you want
[14:22:42] <sillyslux> al_nz1, try breakpoints
[14:22:49] <PlanC> sure
[14:22:56] <PlanC> send me teamviewer details over a message and I'll take a look
[14:23:01] <taplar> works for me after commenting the wysiwyg part
[14:23:07] <PlanC> taplar: same here
[14:23:35] <taplar> only works on the first one though
[14:23:52] <PlanC> that seems to be what he wants though
[14:24:00] <taplar> ah, right, cause of the id
[14:24:02] <PlanC> not hard to change with an .each
[14:24:21] <al_nz1> thanks PlanC
[14:29:57] <z1haze_work> it has to be a firefox property or something
[14:39:10] <soee> how can i detect and watch of div content changes ?
[14:42:22] <al_nz1> anyone else here using sublime?
[14:49:19] <catbadger> I'm listening to sublime
[14:49:22] <catbadger> ;)
[15:00:06] <catbadger> I spent DAYS tracking down an alignment bug and we just discovered it was do to browser being zoomed in *FACEPALM*
[15:01:15] <al_nz1> is this the correct way to call a function addipv from a change event ? $("#ipv-question1.selectpicker").change(addipv());
[15:03:00] <al_nz1> there is still something messed up with that even
[15:03:03] <al_nz1> event
[15:03:17] <al_nz1> it fires on page load, but not subsequent
[15:04:06] <catbadger> is that element added via code?
[15:04:47] <al_nz1> catbadger: no. hard coded
[15:04:51] <taplar> take off the () on the addipv
[15:05:25] <catbadger> or do it this way:   $(document).on('click', '#ipv-question1.selectpicker', function(){addipv()});
[15:05:37] <taplar> lol, don't do that, :P
[15:05:46] <al_nz1> taplar: its not that. I tried $("#ipv-question1").change(alert("hello"));   but it doesnt fire
[15:05:51] <taplar> same thing
[15:05:56] <al_nz1> it fires only on document load
[15:06:00] <taplar> your executing a method rather than providing a function reference
[15:06:17] <taplar> change() expects you to give it a reference to a function
[15:06:22] <taplar> something() is an execution
[15:06:28] <taplar> while "something" is the reference
[15:06:48] <taplar> alert is the reference, alert() is the execution
[15:07:17] <al_nz1> so .change.alert("hello") ?
[15:07:37] <taplar> if your going to do alert, wrap it in an anonymous function like catbadger said
[15:07:52] <taplar> otherwise if your wanting to do what you were saying, giving it just a method to execute, take off the ()
[15:08:06] <taplar> $("#ipv-question1.selectpicker").change(addipv);
[15:09:43] <al_nz1> taplar: ok. but I thought normally a function is called by myFunction()
[15:10:02] <taplar> your not calling the function, your giving a function to change to call when the change event happens
[15:10:48] <al_nz1> taplar: ok, i see
[15:12:29] <al_nz1> and further up in my code I have ethnicity.value == "Asian" - which works. where ethnicity is a id. but then I tried to alert a value with alert(ipv-question.value);
[15:13:07] <al_nz1> and I get ipv is not defined
[15:14:39] <al_nz1> where ipv-question1 is a id also
[15:14:43] <al_nz1> for a selectpicker
[15:15:45] <taplar> i may be wrong but i don't think '-' is valid to be apart of a variable name
[15:15:53] <taplar> no, it's not
[15:16:27] <taplar> not without setting and referencing it with array notation
[15:16:50] <al_nz1> right....fixing it
[15:19:05] <al_nz1> would it be convention to use the format ipvQuestion
[15:21:47] <taplar> camelcase is common
[15:22:25] <al_nz1> ok
[15:23:48] <al_nz1> and if it is treating ipvquestion.value as a string, rather than number,is it probably because I havent cast it as type=number in the html?
[15:24:28] <taplar> all attributes are strings
[15:26:45] <sillyslux> with <input type="number"... you can enter only numbers
[15:27:04] <taplar> sure, but the attributes on the markup are all still strings
[15:27:07] <al_nz1> they are not inputs anyway
[15:27:10] <sillyslux> yes
[15:27:23] <al_nz1> they are selectors
[15:27:30] <taplar> huh?
[15:27:35] <al_nz1> I might use either parseInt or just prepend it with +
[15:27:52] <al_nz1> taplar: thehtml element is <select>
[15:27:56] <sillyslux> or Number(ipvQuestion.value)
[15:28:15] <taplar> oh, lol, you confused me with the use of 'selector' heh
[15:28:33] <taplar> a select, selects, or dropdown, :P
[15:29:02] <sillyslux> $("thisIsASelector")
[15:29:07] <taplar> ^
[15:29:35] <ali_> Hi All
[15:29:41] <al_nz1> well thanks for everybody's patience with me this morning
[15:29:59] <ali_> I need your suggestions regarding query plugins
[15:30:02] <sillyslux> al_nz1, have you made any progress?
[15:30:02] <al_nz1> i need to get up
[15:30:10] <al_nz1> sillyslux: yeah heaps.
[15:30:17] <al_nz1> the event fires now
[15:30:25] <al_nz1> the responses are added up
[15:30:32] <ali_> I want to that if any jquery plugin is available to rotate ,scale and drag image
[15:30:45] <al_nz1> sillyslux: but the drop down is kinda dumb - it lets the user select 1 or 0
[15:30:57] <sillyslux> make it yes/no
[15:31:12] <al_nz1> sillyslux: and then has a key that a 1 = yes and a 0 = no at the bottom of the page
[15:31:15] <taplar> change it to radio buttons
[15:31:21] <ali_> User must be able to drag,rotate and scale the image
[15:31:22] <taplar> and style them
[15:31:37] <al_nz1> sillyslux: why not just change the selections to "yes" or "no" and let the logic count the yes's
[15:31:51] <taplar> al_nz1: one sec, i'll show ya
[15:32:06] <al_nz1> ok
[15:32:32] <sillyslux> yes o/c, you can even have <option value="1">yes</option> iirc
[15:34:18] <Doddlin> Hi! I need some basic help with an error with math, tried everything but am only getting NaN...
[15:35:23] <drewery> are you sure it is not returning a string?
[15:36:08] <Doddlin> drewery, I think I am
[15:36:17] <Doddlin> I’ll try to construct a quick fiddle
[15:36:30] <drewery> yeah, that's what it sounds like
[15:36:35] <taplar> al_nz1: https://jsfiddle.net/fsLnL3mt/
[15:36:40] <taplar> you can style it however
[15:37:07] <al_nz1> taplar: yeah thats nice
[15:37:18] <al_nz1> does it have advantage over dropdown?
[15:37:32] <Doddlin> drewery, does .keyup not work in jsfiddle?
[15:37:37] <taplar> dropdowns are really more for multiple choices
[15:37:44] <taplar> what your doing, Yes/No, is more of a boolean choice
[15:37:56] <taplar> which befits either a checkbox or  radio buttons
[15:38:05] <al_nz1> taplar: riht
[15:38:06] <al_nz1> right
[15:38:13] <al_nz1> thanks
[15:38:27] <al_nz1> might be quicker for the peoplemaking the selection too
[15:38:28] <taplar> technically a checkbox would be more appropriate, but you can't style a checkbox like that, :)
[15:38:35] <Doddlin> drewery, this is what it is atm
[15:38:36] <Doddlin> https://jsfiddle.net/fo5tz311/
[15:39:49] <Doddlin> can’t see where anything could be considered a string?
[15:40:25] <robertmaxrees> why isn't wordcounts an array btw?
[15:41:00] <Doddlin> robertmaxrees, no clue, kindof stole this right of stackof
[15:41:13] <robertmaxrees> .val() returns a string btw.,
[15:41:46] <Doddlin> robertmaxrees, I thought it did so i tried to () that with parseInt but it did not help :S
[15:42:32] <robertmaxrees> because you read it once on pageload and it's empty.
[15:42:59] <robertmaxrees> there's no number to parse out of ''
[15:43:03] <Doddlin> but as it is within .keyup, it should be updated?
[15:43:22] <robertmaxrees> in keyup of #textarea
[15:44:00] <Doddlin> yeah, that is true, but as that is where I am writing later, I thought it would still catch changes :S
[15:44:04] <Doddlin> where should I put it?
[15:44:30] <robertmaxrees> also, neededLength != neededlength
[15:44:51] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/fo5tz311/3/
[15:44:54] <robertmaxrees> casing is important.
[15:44:59] <Doddlin> OH
[15:45:06] <Doddlin> jees, how did I miss that one -.-
[15:45:22] <robertmaxrees> :) the simplest coding mistakes tend to be the hardest to find.
[15:47:01] <Doddlin> robertmaxrees, haha true that! Thanks a buch! :D
[15:47:07] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[15:48:04] <RottenCore> http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/jquery-multi-step-form-with-progress-bar <— i’m using this excellent script for a multi part form
[15:48:13] <RottenCore> here: https://www.swiftcomm.co.uk/landing-mobile.php
[15:48:19] <robertmaxrees> lol this guy again.
[15:48:23] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:48:29] <RottenCore> it was workign FINE
[15:48:33] <RottenCore> haha yeah me again
[15:48:46] <RottenCore> but i did somethign to the easings and now they kinda stutter in from the bottom
[15:48:51] <RottenCore> and i have no idea what :(
[15:48:56] <robertmaxrees> what'd you do to the easings?
[15:49:06] <RottenCore> I have no idea. nothing that I’m aware of
[15:49:10] <RottenCore> it was workign fine for days
[15:49:11] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:49:20] <robertmaxrees> so start rolling back changes until it's no longer broken.
[15:49:23] <RottenCore> I think the boss may have tried to “fix” something
[15:49:24] <robertmaxrees> then you know what broke it.
[15:49:32] <robertmaxrees> please tell me you use git.
[15:49:36] <robertmaxrees> or svn or something
[15:49:38] <RottenCore> I would normally
[15:49:39] <psuedo-js> Hi everyone. I have a date range I am echoing via php but I want the second month to not show if they are in the same month. For example, Sept 21 - Sept 26 should be Sept 21 - 26 whereas a different month should show, i.e. Sept 26 - Oct 1
[15:49:58] <psuedo-js> does anyone have any recommendations on how I can achieve that using js?
[15:50:00] <RottenCore> but it’s nothing I’ve got a backup of. I’d killed my local files already cuz I was done wit it
[15:50:26] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore this is easyish.
[15:50:38] <robertmaxrees> it's because the new one shows before the old one disappears.
[15:50:41] <RottenCore> it should be, I just don’t know where to start
[15:50:58] <robertmaxrees> i just explained where to start :)
[15:53:03] <psuedo-js> robertmaxrees can you give me a hand? you helped me out once before while I was using a different username so I know you know your stuff :P
[15:53:22] <robertmaxrees> psuedo-js your question looks like a PHP question.
[15:53:25] <robertmaxrees> not a JS question.
[15:53:52] <RottenCore> Eh, I really don’t understand the easings that much. I’m guessing it’s in the CSS somewhere
[15:53:53] <psuedo-js> I am actually echoing the values onto the page and then storing them as variables in js
[15:54:03] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore it's not a css problem ...
[15:54:13] <psuedo-js> and then appending them to the link in the nav via js
[15:54:14] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore the new one is being shown prior to the old one going away.
[15:54:19] <robertmaxrees> psuedo-js why would you do that in JS?
[15:54:53] <RottenCore> right, got that. the jquery i’m using is native from the example link above though. that’s why I’m lost. nothing there’s changed
[15:55:06] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore then what DID change?
[15:55:21] <RottenCore> that’s what i’m having a hard time figuring out! haha
[15:55:36] <robertmaxrees> so if i compare the js and it's different, what will that tell you?
[15:55:37] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:55:39] <RottenCore> I just replaced the jquery with the native from the example just in case that’s what it was, but no dice
[15:55:51] <robertmaxrees> then start lookin' at CSS i guess.
[15:56:08] <robertmaxrees> check out your inspector and start using it.
[15:57:30] <RottenCore> have been.
[15:57:37] <RottenCore> i can’t see anything wonky in it
[16:00:25] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore your page markup looks broken.
[16:00:34] <robertmaxrees> should everything really be in the navigation div?
[16:00:58] <RottenCore> not sure, i didn’t build the template
[16:01:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd look into that.
[16:03:34] <RottenCore> I’ll let the boss man know to let the “designer” knwo
[16:03:50] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i'd start playuing around with the styles on the site.
[16:03:57] <robertmaxrees> since that's the only other real culprit.
[16:04:16] <RottenCore> yeah im thinking it’s gotta be something in the styles then
[16:04:45] <robertmaxrees> that navigation div looks real suspect.
[16:05:16] <RottenCore> that hasn’t changed though
[16:05:37] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't rule anything out tbqh
[16:05:43] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a lot of people touched a lot of things.
[16:08:02] <RottenCore> ok it’s def the CSS
[16:08:10] <RottenCore> there’s another for doing it too and I know nobody touched it
[16:08:14] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[16:08:27] <RottenCore> they both pull from the same stylesheet
[16:08:28] <RottenCore> crap
[16:08:30] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:18:14] <RottenCore> fixed it. a position: absolute; was commented out
[16:18:19] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[16:18:21] <robertmaxrees> well done :)
[16:18:22] <RottenCore> wuah wuah
[16:21:45] <RottenCore> no chance you’re handy with ajax is there? haha
[16:21:58] <robertmaxrees> i am actually.
[16:22:02] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple stuff.
[16:28:23] <igcewieling> Am I correct in thinking I cannot .focus() a hidden element?
[16:31:33] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you would in the first place.
[16:33:44] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: so the css is applied before I .show() the parent element.
[16:34:04] <igcewieling> not the smartest idea I've had.
[16:35:32] <RottenCore> then maybe you can help me with something
[16:35:40] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore just ask the channel.
[16:35:45] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[16:35:54] <RottenCore> is there an ajax channel? I didn’t see one
[16:36:02] <robertmaxrees> i mean this channel.
[16:36:05] <RottenCore> but it’s not a jquery question, so I feel bad asking it broadly. haha
[16:36:06] <robertmaxrees> no need to ask me if I'm good with it.
[16:36:11] <robertmaxrees> just ask.
[16:36:17] <RottenCore> https://pixelfunder.com <—— here
[16:36:25] <RottenCore> click on register
[16:36:31] <RottenCore> a neat little modal reg form pops up
[16:36:43] <RottenCore> I added some code to make the “choose role” pulldown appear
[16:37:06] <RottenCore> but ever since then, when you register, it works. registration goes through, user gets an email, everything
[16:37:10] <RottenCore> but the page freezes
[16:37:18] <RottenCore> and I can’t figure out why
[16:37:19] <robertmaxrees> so what code did you add?
[16:37:31] <RottenCore> http://pastebin.com/puHCQGii
[16:37:47] <RottenCore> to the bottom of WP’s functions.php where it should go
[16:37:50] <RottenCore> take the code out, it works fine
[16:38:02] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:38:06] <robertmaxrees> this is a php question.
[16:39:02] <RottenCore> I guess?
[16:39:13] <robertmaxrees> ... the code you pasted is php.
[16:39:59] <robertmaxrees> also: define "freeze"
[16:40:02] <robertmaxrees> nothing has frozen for me.
[16:40:13] <robertmaxrees> the login modal just stays open with that gif.
[16:40:59] <RottenCore> i guess that’s what I mean by freeze
[16:41:06] <RottenCore> i should say the form freezes, I guess
[16:41:07] <robertmaxrees> yeha, that's not frozen.
[16:41:15] <robertmaxrees> no - the modal just doesn't close.
[16:41:26] <robertmaxrees> and it's because of the response you're passing back.
[16:41:28] <RottenCore> hadn’t thought about it that way
[16:41:48] <robertmaxrees> "freeze" implies the application itself locked up in some way.
[16:41:56] <RottenCore> you’re right, my bad there
[16:42:11] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, check out the callback for the post.
[16:42:35] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:42:43] <robertmaxrees> you're getting an error in your php: <b>Fatal error</b>:  Cannot redeclare wpdocs_set_html_mail_content_type() (previously declared in /home/spellta/pixelfunder.com/wp-content/themes/funding_press/functions.php:3514) in <b>/home/spellta/pixelfunder.com/wp-content/themes/funding_press/functions.php</b> on line <b>3513</b><br />
[16:43:14] <develon> your page is btw mixed https/http, it's loading external data from http links, i.e. imgur
[16:43:20] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's bad, too.
[16:43:27] <RottenCore> oh I know. i’m not in charge of that part
[16:43:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:43:42] <RottenCore> mostly giffs, right?
[16:43:59] <robertmaxrees> anyway, see the issue?
[16:44:03] <RottenCore> yup
[16:44:06] <RottenCore> I believe so
[16:44:14] <develon> also some ssl error on another link to agkn.com
[16:44:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:48:59] <RottenCore> robertmaxrees: where did you find that php error? i’m in console in chrome and can’t find it
[16:49:23] <robertmaxrees> go to the network tab, go to the ajax submit for the form, and look at the response.
[16:55:43] <RottenCore> totally not seeing that
[16:55:51] <robertmaxrees> which tools are you using?
[16:56:39] <robertmaxrees> chrome?  firefox?
[16:56:40] <robertmaxrees> something else?
[17:01:52] <OnceMe> can someone tell me what is the name of this jQuery plugin https://www.diggernaut.com/ effect when you hover on that page and you get that lines around your mouse pointer?
[17:02:17] <RottenCore> Chrome
[17:02:27] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe doesn't look like a jquery plugin maybe?
[17:02:59] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore okay - page link again?
[17:03:13] <RottenCore> https://pixelfunder.com/
[17:03:17] <OnceMe> it is jquery plugin because I remember using it somewhere
[17:03:20] <OnceMe> but cant recall the name
[17:04:02] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore https://i.imgur.com/tjTIc22.png
[17:04:26] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore go to "network", filter to just XHR, and then look at the preview for the bad call.
[17:04:44] <RottenCore> Ah i see
[17:04:46] <RottenCore> thanks, sir
[17:04:52] <RottenCore> (I’m assuming sir, given the name)
[17:05:00] <robertmaxrees> lol i hate being called a sir, but definitely.
[17:07:11] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe check the js for stuff drawing to #canvas-particle
[17:07:32] <OnceMe> link?
[17:07:41] <robertmaxrees> erm
[17:07:41] <robertmaxrees> what?
[17:07:46] <robertmaxrees> it's the page you sent.
[17:08:15] <OnceMe> found it http://codepen.io/Roshinjose167/pen/BjdaKZ :D
[17:08:22] <robertmaxrees> cool
[17:09:22] <robertmaxrees> so it's not a jquery plugin.
[17:15:10] <OnceMe> ok thanks
[17:46:49] <Jon_R> is there any obvious reason why there would be a difference between $("<iframe
[17:47:05] <Jon_R> is there any obvious reason why there would be a difference between $("<iframe>")...on("load", foo) and $("<iframe>")...load(foo)
[17:47:28] <taplar> nope
[17:47:56] <taplar> provided that 'foo' is a method reference
[17:48:10] <robertmaxrees> the event handler version of load uses .on() under the hood fwiw.
[17:48:32] <Jon_R> i'm asking because there *is* a difference
[17:48:42] <robertmaxrees> what are you seeing?
[17:48:52] <robertmaxrees> because there shouldn't be a difference at all is what we're sayig
[17:48:52] <Jon_R> .on("load", func) works... .load(func) says jquery.min.js:4 Uncaught TypeError: a.indexOf is not a function
[17:49:05] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?
[17:49:18] <Jon_R> 3.1.0
[17:49:23] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[17:49:25] <robertmaxrees> they removed it in 3.0
[17:49:34] <Jon_R> removed what? load() ?
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> the event handler load, yeah.
[17:49:51] <taplar> the load in 3.1.0 looks like it is expecting a url for param 1
[17:50:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's the ajax shortcut one.
[17:50:05] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.load
[17:50:23] <robertmaxrees> right.  that's the only one that exists now.
[17:50:30] <robertmaxrees> the event handler syntax went buh-bye.
[17:50:50] <Jon_R> ah, so .on(foo, bar) is now always preferred to .foo(bar) ?
[17:51:03] <robertmaxrees> has been for quite a while.
[17:51:14] <robertmaxrees> the load event handler was technically deprecated in 1.8
[17:51:26] <Jon_R> the documentation for .load() *really* doesn't make it clear that it's been removed - it's still in the documentation and function list, you have to notice that it says in small type at the side of the screen "removed: 3.0"
[17:51:45] <RottenCore> thank again for teh help, robertmaxrees. I think I’ve got a handle on it
[17:51:46] <RottenCore> kidna
[17:52:01] <robertmaxrees> it's right there in the heading for the method definition.
[17:52:16] <robertmaxrees> what else should they do Jon_R ?
[17:52:18] <Jon_R> yes, as i said, in small print, way over to the side
[17:52:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, in the heading.  How do you suggest they improve it?
[17:52:33] <Jon_R> well if it's been removed I would suggest (a) remove it from the function index and (b) put a BIG RED BOX saying "removed"
[17:52:40] <taplar> glowing marquee
[17:52:48] <robertmaxrees> the problem is lots of people are using older versions of jquery.
[17:52:52] <robertmaxrees> so that would be very confusion as well.
[17:52:52] <taplar> #bringbackmarquee
[17:53:15] <Jon_R> ok sure, but at the very least the big red box on the function detail page and greyed out or something in the function list
[17:53:34] <robertmaxrees> Except that's still misleading - it was removed in a particular version.
[17:53:45] <robertmaxrees> but plenty of people still use prior versions.
[17:53:58] <Jon_R> yeah usually you expect the live documentation on a web site to mainly document the latest version
[17:54:08] <Jon_R> it's not confusing to do so
[17:54:19] <robertmaxrees> you say that, but then go check out the mobile docs lol
[17:54:25] <robertmaxrees> i don't disagree that there may be a better way to communicate that, but it's hard to get right.
[17:54:31] <taplar> i'd say most people do not use the latest version
[17:54:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:54:43] <robertmaxrees> especially with the 3.0 support drop.
[17:55:07] <taplar> i'd even wager that typical business practice is to not be on the latest version
[17:55:20] <taplar> let others find the bugs, :)
[17:55:22] <robertmaxrees> depends on what it is, but yeah.  rougly.
[17:56:00] <robertmaxrees> like i said, I don't disagree there's a better way to communicate that, but it's hard when you have a library used by like 60% of the top 1000 websites or w/e.
[17:56:11] <robertmaxrees> how do you document that in a way that's clear and concise?
[17:56:33] <Jon_R> big red box, "REMOVED IN 3.0"
[17:56:46] <psuedo-js> ~c==3
[17:56:51] <robertmaxrees> alright.  mind popping in a ticket?
[17:57:04] <Jon_R> ok cool
[17:57:24] <robertmaxrees> let the maintainers take a look at see what they decide on.
[18:07:15] <Jon_R> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/984
[18:07:22] <Jon_R> ok pub time, thanks for the help :-)
[18:07:28] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[18:11:51] <larsi> hi guys does it seems like on resize isn't triggering when I click the minimize/maximize button in chrome
[18:11:57] <larsi> is there a way to catch that action as well?
[18:12:03] <taplar> not a page event
[18:12:18] <taplar> might, 'might', execute a blur
[18:12:43] <taplar> oh wait, maximize might do a resize, :/
[18:12:56] <robertmaxrees> why is it important?
[18:13:13] <larsi> I am modifying something on the screen depending on screen size
[18:13:19] <larsi> I suppose css would be better in this scenario
[18:13:22] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[18:13:24] <taplar> media queries
[18:13:25] <robertmaxrees> where i was going with that.
[18:15:08] <larsi> :p
[18:23:54] <kevr> is there a slider plugin that's popular?
[18:24:03] <robertmaxrees> like a carousel?
[18:24:21] <kevr> like an image view slider
[18:24:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah so a carousel.
[18:24:35] <kevr> gotcha, i thought carousels were different
[18:24:39] <kevr> but yes i guess
[18:25:16] <robertmaxrees> there are tons.  owl, bxslider, the one in bootstrap.
[18:25:24] <dni-> bxslider is great ;)
[18:25:33] <dni-> bootstrap too ;)
[18:25:37] <taplar> i think we use the bs one
[18:25:37] <kevr> oh i didnt know bootstrap had one built in
[18:25:39] <kevr> interesting
[18:25:49] <dni-> mhm
[18:25:52] <kevr> robertmaxrees: thank you for the suggestions, i'll check both of them out
[18:25:52] <shoky> hey robertmaxrees, i think i remember you have a modal dialog jq plugin that you usually suggest to people - care to remind me which?
[18:25:57] <robertmaxrees> http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/carousel/
[18:26:13] <robertmaxrees> shoky jqmodal maybe?
[18:26:21] <robertmaxrees> that's the last one i used that wasn't the bs one.
[18:26:26] <shoky> possibly. thanks
[18:26:29] <robertmaxrees> deffo

[21:13:22] <newbie> Hey I am new to all of this but am trying to make a slideshow for my lab website. I downloaded jquery-3.1.1.js and the cycle plugin but my slideshow will not run. It just stays on the first image and the prev and next buttons do not work
[21:16:10] <newbie> when i use a jquery version older than 3.0.0 it runs but i guess the slide show does not fit into the wrapper anymore since there are scroll bars and changing the size of the wrapper does not seem to help. Although I did not go crazy and make it huge
[22:50:19] <Null_> hey is there a way to check if a variable equals one of multiple varriables, like if x == (a || b || c) ?
[23:10:13] <D-rex> Null_: http://pastebin.com/iYAyq40e that should work
