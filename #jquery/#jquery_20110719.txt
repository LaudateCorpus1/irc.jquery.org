[00:02:22] <coldhead> that was so right on
[00:03:05] <hariom> Is it possible to pass parameters that will be used in ui dialog button's callback function? I have created a dialog widget that takes 2 buttons submit and cancel. Submit button on click, executes a function that needs some parameters to run. How can I pass these parameters when I call dialog using $("#submit-dialog").dialog('open') ?
[00:03:42] * systemfault wants to hurt Kent Beck for choosing python as the language for implementing xUnit in his TDD book.
[00:04:00] <coldhead> aw what's wrong with python :(
[00:04:04] <systemfault> Nothing
[00:04:13] <systemfault> But right now, I wanted to learn TDD, not python.
[00:04:37] <coldhead> hariom: you can try to pass them through the environment within a closure or you can set and get them via data()
[00:04:46] <coldhead> python is just pseudocode, systemfault
[00:04:54] <coldhead> ergo you already know it :D
[00:05:03] <systemfault> :)
[00:05:16] <systemfault> It has weird __THINGIES__
[00:05:21] <hariom> systemfault: what is TDD?
[00:05:40] <systemfault> Test Driven Development.
[00:06:06] <systemfault> That kind of stuff is more popular on the backend side.
[00:06:19] <systemfault> Anything involving DOM is shit to test.
[00:06:20] <coldhead> i thought it was testosterone driven development

[00:11:41] <K1ng> any idea what the heck is wrong with http://jsfiddle.net/7eLUs/1/ ?
[00:13:00] <K1ng> it was a javascript. i converted to jquery but i am getting error now :(
[00:13:30] <coldhead> you can;t assign to a function()
[00:13:32] <coldhead>  $(this).val() = v + '/';
[00:13:35] <coldhead> should be more like
[00:13:44] <coldhead>  $(this).val(v + '/');

[00:15:30] <K1ng> Thanks coldhead :)
[00:15:58] <coldhead> no trouble, K1ng!
[00:16:27] <K1ng> coldhead, do you have a jquery validator rules for 18+?
[00:16:43] <K1ng> method*
[00:17:27] <coldhead> you could do it in a couple of lines just by converting their date of birth to a JS date() object, adding 18 years and testing if it's in the past
[00:17:33] <coldhead> that's what i'd do
[00:18:08] <K1ng> can you give me an example?
[00:18:11] <systemfault> Yeah, simple enough
[00:18:45] <coldhead> doing an example is basically just doing the whole thing in this case

[02:04:07] <beevi7> Me-Selfe no, sorry ;)
[02:04:21] <dr0id> why do you ask so ?
[02:05:51] <beevi7> because i thought there might be a good chance to find someone working at facebook here, who can help me with a question (which i'd then ask privately)
[02:06:39] <jsn00b> folks, am trying to do get results from a cross-site domain using jquery
[02:06:43] <jsn00b> http://jsfiddle.net/9cEhn/1/
[02:07:02] <jsn00b> the script fails, since it expects the data in json format
[02:07:03] <Me-Selfe> beevi7: the common practice here is to ask the question in the channel, might be you don't need to work at facebook to know the answer...
[02:07:35] <jsn00b> has anyone done this before ? say sending a simple get request to a remote host and get the data size
[02:08:13] <systemfault> jsn00b: You cannot access anything that is not on the same domain with XHR
[02:09:55] <jsn00b> systemfault: but I saw some articles, which says i can ...
[02:10:28] <systemfault> jsn00b: You can with XHR2 (Not widely supported) and with a hack called JSONP
[02:11:00] <systemfault> jQuery supports the JSONP hack
[02:11:04] <beevi7> Me-Selfe i know the common practice. but in this case i doubt anybody can help me ;) i'm trying to contact the recruiting team but my email always gets rejected.

[02:41:31] <Caelum> Me-Selfe: yeah I can, will just do that thanks
[02:44:48] <silv3r_m00n> the submit button inside a form calls a function , inside that function I need all values that the form would submit , the input fields inside the form are not known (generated dynamically) , is that possible ?
[02:47:02] <quicksilver> silv3r_m00n: yes.
[02:47:12] <silv3r_m00n> how ?
[02:47:39] <quicksilver> use selectors to select the inputs.
[02:47:44] <StyXLT> hi fellows, i am curious. is it possible to track which part of the script changes an attribute of a specific element? i'm using firebug
[02:47:54] <quicksilver> for example, if the form has ID foo, you could use $('#foo input') to get all the inputs.
[02:47:56] <silv3r_m00n> is there some other way ?
[02:48:09] <silv3r_m00n> I can select all input select and textareas
[02:48:22] <silv3r_m00n> but is there some inbuilt function that gives all values as an array ?
[02:48:27] <quicksilver> no.
[02:48:30] <silv3r_m00n> hmm
[02:48:30] <silv3r_m00n> o
[02:48:31] <silv3r_m00n> ok
[02:48:37] <quicksilver> what's wrong with that way?
[02:49:06] <silv3r_m00n> input + select + textarea , these are the only 3 tags to select or are there more ?
[02:49:31] <quicksilver> I think that's all.
[02:49:40] <StyXLT> anyone have an idea about my question?
[02:54:27] <sprezzatura> i am doing $('input, select, textarea').attr('disabled', 'disabled'); to disable all the form elements in my page. but this doesnt seem to work. comments?
[02:56:11] <Kambfhase> what do you mean by "doesnt work"?
[02:56:39] <silv3r_m00n> quicksilver: var $elements = $('#entry_form').attr('elements');
[02:57:56] <sprezzatura> Kambfhase: i am still able to edit the input fields
[02:58:32] <quicksilver> silv3r_m00n: hmm yes I didn't know about that one :)
[02:58:45] <quicksilver> silv3r_m00n: that's a part of the DOM I've never noticed
[02:58:54] <quicksilver> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/form.elements
[02:59:35] <sprezzatura> actually, this was working before, i am not if something has changed! darn
[03:00:27] <sprezzatura> i guess $(document).ready(function() is not working! sigh
[03:01:28] <Caelum> I am doing onclick='$("#login_form").submit();' but nothing happens, IE doesn't say there was an error either
[03:03:11] <Caelum> do I need to do anything else?

[03:04:56] <AlexC_> one that just made me faceplant was an alert(screen.height) on my HTC Hero returned a value of 1003 ....
[03:05:57] <StyXLT> that's probably the document height and not the window height
[03:06:03] <greg_f> How can I get cursor position in textarea and set some text here?
[03:06:34] <AlexC_> StyXLT: it's a dummy HTML5 page with just one '<h1>' element with no styles
[03:08:43] <AlexC_> sajjad: in the most polite way; go away.
[03:11:28] <AlexC_> when you actually come to develop for them, both Android and iOS fail incredibly that it makes you really wonder
[03:12:28] <Caelum> why could $("#form").submit(); silently not do anything?
[03:12:52] <AlexC_> no element with ID "form"
[03:14:06] <Caelum> there is, checked that. Well I just switched to $("#submit").click(); and that works, so screw it :)

[03:46:46] <bseanvt> hi
[03:46:59] <bseanvt> i'm looking for some help with a jquery/ajax problem
[03:47:02] <bseanvt> here is the fiddle
[03:47:03] <bseanvt> http://jsfiddle.net/bseanvt/k2gcG/
[03:48:06] <bseanvt> i need the updated dom (via ajax) to be fully functional
[03:49:06] <Whirl3do> How do I stop the animation on an element and tell it to go to it's destination state (rather than stopping in the middle of the animation)?
[03:49:51] <jovrtn> bseanvt: can you be more general in what you're trying to accomplish?
[03:50:16] <chrisalexthomas> hi, can anyone tell me why the "tab" disappears when you click "LOGIN" in the header? I'm just trying a simple animate and it disappears until the animation is finished, http://obbex.com
[03:50:18] <bseanvt> what do you mean?
[03:50:24] <Whirl3do> nvm, found it: stop(true, true).  thx though
[03:50:41] <bseanvt> is that not descriptive enough?
[03:51:14] <jovrtn> i'm just curious what you're trying to accomplish
[03:51:33] <jovrtn> what sort of data are you fetching with the ajax calls?
[03:51:46] <bseanvt> i'm using pjax to populate my pages
[03:51:50] <bseanvt> all the returned content is html
[03:52:01] <bseanvt> but new elements added to the dom, jquery isn't aware of
[03:52:14] <jovrtn> how are you adding them to the dom
[03:52:28] <bseanvt> ajax request populates the page with html
[03:52:57] <bseanvt> it will fetch valid html from a server... and inject it into a container
[03:53:11] <jovrtn> so you have that part working fine?
[03:53:16] <jovrtn> the new content appears on the page?
[03:53:18] <bseanvt> yes
[03:53:54] <bseanvt> did you see the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/bseanvt/k2gcG/
[03:53:59] <bseanvt> i tried to explain my problem
[03:54:01] <jovrtn> yeah
[03:54:07] <bseanvt> prob. not clear enough
[03:54:22] <jovrtn> sort of has the problem's head cut off without ajax data being injected
[03:54:35] <bseanvt> sorry about that
[03:54:42] <jovrtn> no worries
[03:55:02] <bseanvt> i'm using ajaxStop callback to rerun my code
[03:55:08] <bseanvt> that acts on the newly added elements
[03:55:23] <bseanvt> i'm looking for live() like functionality but on page load
[03:55:30] <bseanvt> rather than an click event
[03:57:37] <jovrtn> let me tinker around with this, one sec
[03:58:16] <jovrtn> which selectbox plugin are you using?
[03:58:17] <jovrtn> http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/projects/js/jquery/selectBox/ ?
[03:59:13] <bseanvt> i'm using this one http://www.bulgaria-web-developers.com/projects/javascript/selectbox/
[04:03:58] <TeddyMurray> hey, $(".edit-item").get(current_page).append("<div class='edit-item'></div>");
[04:04:08] <TeddyMurray> this is wrong because its returning a html object
[04:04:17] <TeddyMurray> how would i get the index and then append?
[04:04:29] <TeddyMurray> so it goes after the right element
[04:06:44] <anavel> hello
[04:06:51] <jovrtn> bseanvt: http://jsfiddle.net/ovrtn/k2gcG/1/
[04:06:58] <jovrtn> I set it up with that first selectbox plugin I found
[04:07:16] <jovrtn> which isn't important, just shows that it's being loaded in in the ajaxComplete callback
[04:07:57] <bseanvt> thanks
[04:08:14] <jovrtn> not sure why you need so many anonymous functions
[04:08:17] <anavel> i am trying to $('textarea#x').val('something). Where textarea is a member of a modal dialog. Problem is, the textarea value doesn't change consistently. Sometimes it change, sometimes it doesn't. Tried it on opera and firefox. Same problem.
[04:08:34] <anavel> but the funny thing is, it works flawlessly with <input>
[04:08:45] <anavel> where <input> is the member of the same modal dialog.
[04:08:59] <bseanvt> a follow up question...
[04:09:02] <anavel> any idea ?
[04:09:19] <bseanvt> if that html is loaded via a regular request
[04:09:22] <bseanvt> and not ajax
[04:09:26] <bseanvt> it won't work
[04:09:45] <bseanvt> since it's inside the ajaxComplete callback... or will it?
[04:09:57] <jovrtn> regular request as in reloading the page?
[04:10:02] <bseanvt> yeah
[04:10:07] <bseanvt> my homepage won't need ajax
[04:10:11] <bseanvt> just rendering partials
[04:10:21] <bseanvt> but clicking around will reload certain parts of the dom
[04:10:30] <jovrtn> if you're not loading it with ajax then you don't need the ajaxComplete function
[04:10:48] <koichirose> Hi, I have this function to filter items (which is not working on JSFiddle, I'm not sure why). http://jsfiddle.net/TVD2f/ - anyway, the problem is that with a bunch of stuff (300+ elements) it becomes VERY slow...any optimizations/fixes?
[04:10:50] <bseanvt> so i have to write that code twice?
[04:10:53] <jovrtn> you would just set up a test on window.load
[04:11:34] <jovrtn> to check for a url parameter or something you set when you had the script reload the page
[04:11:51] <jovrtn> well
[04:12:01] <jovrtn> what purpose does reloading the page serve?
[04:12:15] <jovrtn> that sounds like poor user interaction
[04:15:03] <bseanvt> the first time the homepage it's not populating elements with ajax
[04:15:18] <bseanvt> only when you click on certain links
[04:15:31] <bseanvt> i'm using PJAX
[04:17:11] <bseanvt> which will manage repopulating the page
[04:17:39] <bseanvt> but you can also visit each url and it will render as expected, but not via ajax response
[04:17:50] <bseanvt> just a normal request
[04:18:12] <jovrtn> so it degrades gracefully into a normal non-ajaxy page
[04:18:20] <jovrtn> and links take you to a different page
[04:18:39] <bseanvt> yes
[04:19:02] <pr0ton> hi
[04:19:07] <jovrtn> if it's a normal request, your plugins can be invoked on window.load
[04:19:20] <pr0ton> is there somethign special that lets me take in arguments for a function as  a dict?
[04:19:23] <bseanvt> yes, but i have to write my js twice
[04:19:34] <pr0ton> i know most jquery functions do it that way, but is it like pythonish ?
[04:19:38] <jovrtn> just stick it all in a function
[04:19:42] <jovrtn> and call the function in both places
[04:19:48] <bseanvt> once on normal page load and then again under the ajaxComplete
[04:19:55] <bseanvt> ok, is that the approach?
[04:20:28] <jovrtn> that's what you'd typically do if you're writing the same code in two different places
[04:20:29] <bseanvt> there is not a more elegant approach/a way to use live() or bind() on load
[04:22:09] <bseanvt> i have my js separated into multiple files (for organization) and putting all in a single function isn't ideal
[04:22:19] <bseanvt> calling multiple functions in each isn't either
[04:22:24] <bseanvt> i appreciate your help
[04:22:41] <bfred> quick english question, if you allow me. some website galleries and blogs featured my website, I want to make a page containing all the links to these galleries/blogs. what would the name of the page be? Featurings? Features?
[04:22:45] <bfred> the shorter the better
[04:23:42] <bseanvt> hoping that there was a magic bullet
[04:24:20] <bseanvt> do you know of any performance issue with calling those function over and over again?
[04:24:22] <jovrtn> hmm
[04:24:38] <bseanvt> do i need to unregister each?
[04:24:42] <jovrtn> the issues would be in the efficiency of the code within the function
[04:25:18] <bfred> mentions!
[04:25:58] <ruby_on_tails> http://jsfiddle.net/C9XcR/ why does the first alert give 1000100 but second one gives 100000 ?
[04:26:29] <TeddyMurray> $("#regTitle").html("Hello World"); is this even valid?
[04:26:31] <TeddyMurray> or does html() only get?
[04:26:35] <TeddyMurray> return a value*
[04:26:43] <jovrtn> TeddyMurray: yes it's valid
[04:26:50] <TeddyMurray> so it will replace all the inner html?
[04:26:54] <jovrtn> yes
[04:27:05] <jovrtn> check out text() if you're just setting text
[04:27:26] <guy> .ff { display:none; } in CSS messes up behaviour of jQuery's hide/show
[04:27:30] <TeddyMurray> hmmm, im setting a div but
[04:27:38] <guy> is there a fix for that? other than using jquery to play with CSS
[04:27:41] <TeddyMurray> for some reason html() isn't working the way i expect it.
[04:27:49] <TeddyMurray> $(parent_item).find(".edit-scroll-bar-wrap-parent").html('<div class="scrollbar-status">Card 1 of ' + items_total + '</div>');
[04:28:04] <TeddyMurray> it used to be append, but that's creating multiple scroll bars
[04:28:12] <TeddyMurray> i just want to replace the old one, if it exists
[04:28:40] <jovrtn> replace the old scrollbar-status element?
[04:29:09] <TeddyMurray> wait, its working now o.O
[04:29:12] <TeddyMurray> ghosts in the machine.
[04:29:36] <bseanvt> thanks jovrtn for your help
[04:29:56] <TeddyMurray> thanks also, jovrtn
[04:30:05] <guy> guys, I have performance issues & I can't seem to find any ways to improve the animation. http://anuary.com/svn/hp/pad/index.html
[04:30:18] <jovrtn> bseanvt: sure thing, you should also check out live() with custom events, that could probably get you where you're going but it'll take a bit of reading
[04:30:42] <bseanvt> ok thanks, i've only used it with click
[04:31:05] <jovrtn> essentially you could set up a custom event attached to a div that watches for new content being loaded in
[04:31:17] <magical1> I am trying to work out how to set a cookie depending on the status of an element on the page that is either hidden or shown (controlled by a jquery toggle function) and like wise set the initial state on load when a user comes back to the page in the future, can anyone advise?
[04:31:21] <jovrtn> and then triggers your plugin
[04:32:16] <jovrtn> magical1: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3704452/using-jquery-cookie-js-to-remember-hide-show-element
[04:32:49] <magical1> jovrtn: thanks!
[04:33:07] <jovrtn> np, good luck :)
[04:34:08] <magical1> thx
[04:34:46] <guy> what does this mean in JSLINT? "Problem at line 23 character 10: Expected 'ul' at column 13, not column 10."
[04:34:52] <dpy> does anyone know how to use #wrap on detached dom elements?
[04:35:24] <dpy> I can do $('<div class="inner">').wrap('<div class="outer">');
[04:35:31] <dpy> but how do I get the pointer to that outer?
[04:35:40] <dpy> pointer=reference
[04:37:25] <Me-Selfe> dpy: why would you write that?
[04:37:29] <jovrtn> dpy: $('.inner').wrap('<div class="outer">').parent()
[04:37:37] <dpy> ah!, of course!
[04:42:12] <TeddyMurray> couldnt you just do
[04:42:18] <TeddyMurray> $('.inner').parent() ?
[04:42:37] <TeddyMurray> since after you wrap it, the outer will be parent of inner
[04:42:40] <jovrtn> it'll have no parent until the wrap is executed
[04:43:04] <TeddyMurray> ohhhhh, so you put both statements into one
[04:43:06] <jovrtn> the parent() still refers to the .inner element, but it won't refer to .outer unless it comes after .wrap in the chain
[04:43:11] <jovrtn> er
[04:43:19] <jovrtn> still refers to .inner's parent
[04:43:46] <TeddyMurray> so wrap doesn't return any value then?
[04:43:56] <TeddyMurray> its just chaining the methods?
[04:44:45] <jovrtn> wrap creates the <div> element and inserts it into the DOM
[04:45:00] <fist> hey, is it possible to open a dialog with relative width? (i.e. 30%)? http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-width
[04:45:25] <TeddyMurray> kk
[04:45:30] <TeddyMurray> ty for explaining jovrtn
[04:45:34] <jovrtn> sure
[04:47:06] <jovrtn> fist: I don't think it supports percentages in the width option, but you could use a bit of JS to calculate a pixel width based on the window size
[04:48:56] <jovrtn> something like: var dialogWidth = $(window).width() * 0.5;
[04:49:05] <jovrtn> then .dialog({ width: dialogWidth });
[04:49:26] <jovrtn> that'd be 50% width
[04:50:03] <jovrtn> you'd have to bind that option setter to a window.resize event to maintain its percent fluidity though
[04:50:12] <jovrtn> if it's that important
[04:50:55] <Ceus> hi all
[04:51:12] <Ceus> i have a simple q: can someone explain me the double = ?
[04:51:18] <Ceus> var B, Browser = B = (function() {
[04:51:57] <Ceus> Browser = B = function
[04:52:20] <Me-Selfe> Ceus: it just assign the same value to multiple variables
[04:52:58] <Ceus> alright, variable b and Browser have the same value
[04:53:08] <Ceus> and so its the shortform for it
[04:54:18] <jovrtn> Ceus: basically it's just initializing the B variable, then giving it a value while also assigning that value to the Browser variable
[05:01:39] <fist> jovrtn: thank you
[05:01:47] <jovrtn> fist: np
[05:06:05] <TeddyMurray> hey jovrtn -- i have two radio buttons with the same input name
[05:06:13] <TeddyMurray> $("#create-flashcard-form card-position:checked") i've tried this
[05:06:22] <TeddyMurray> but doesn't seem to work, still getting undefined
[05:06:29] <TeddyMurray> .val() at the end of that
[05:06:46] <ravenzz> you mean .card-position:checked
[05:06:46] <ravenzz> ?
[05:07:15] <TeddyMurray> ohhh
[05:07:19] <TeddyMurray> maybe i mean.. $("#create-flashcard-form input[name='card-position']:checked")
[05:07:28] <ravenzz> dunno
[05:07:36] <TeddyMurray> its the name, though
[05:07:36] <ravenzz> you should show me a demo
[05:07:45] <ravenzz> ?paste
[05:07:45] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:07:46] <TeddyMurray> let me try that real quick
[05:07:52] <jovrtn> that second one looks right
[05:08:04] <TeddyMurray> that worked :)
[05:08:08] <TeddyMurray> thanks ravenzz
[05:08:28] <TeddyMurray> jquery is really nice
[05:08:33] <TeddyMurray> once you get the hang of it
[05:08:38] <sadmicrowave> if you know how to use it
[05:09:48] <TeddyMurray> think jquery will be as popular once html5 is mainstream?
[05:09:55] <mien> Hi, if i want to merge two jquery elements, how can i do that? i want to do like this: var el1 = $(somelement); var el2 = $(someotherelement); var allElements = el1.concat(el2); - however, that does not work.
[05:11:16] <ravenzz> val allElements= el1+el2;
[05:11:17] <ravenzz> ?
[05:12:17] <mien> ravenzz, ill try that.
[05:13:36] <mien> ravenzz, that gives me an array with objects in, i want one object, just like $() gives me.
[05:13:49] <mien> im looking for array_merge for objects i think :)
[05:13:57] <ravenzz> maybe
[05:13:59] <ravenzz> merge()
[05:14:00] <ravenzz> ?
[05:14:03] <ravenzz> ?merge
[05:14:04] <bot-t> jQuery.merge(first, second): Merge the contents of two arrays together into the first array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.merge/
[05:14:47] <ravenzz> yes
[05:14:47] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/TnQ8A/
[05:14:50] <mien> ravenzz, that made the job
[05:14:53] <mien> thanks a lot!
[05:16:07] <ravenzz> you are welcome
[05:16:11] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/TnQ8A/1/ this is better
[05:16:21] <ravenzz> you don't need to store the result into another var
[05:16:35] <anavel> whenever i am trying to do $('textarea').val('something'), textarea value sometimes change, sometimes doesn't. any idea why ?
[05:16:59] <ravenzz> no
[05:17:08] <ravenzz> ?paste your code
[05:17:08] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:18:46] <anavel> well, after i refresh the browser a couple of time, it will works. But sometimes, it won't.
[05:18:59] <anavel> but it works great with <input>.
[05:20:27] <ravenzz> anavel http://jsfiddle.net/GZXzk/
[05:24:04] <hariom> I am using dialog box with submit and cancel buttons and it has a message div where I print the status of the submit button click response coming from the server. This message appear on the first click if the input boxes on the dialog are empty. But when they are filled with some text and I press submit button, submit fires an ajax and on success I set the message on dialog for 'success'. But this message doesn't get printed when I click on the submit firs
[05:24:04] <hariom> t time. I need to click on the submit at least twice to display this message. This is mysterious to me.

[05:33:42] <anavel> turns out, it's the vtip.
[05:34:24] <bjhaid1> Hi, please I am new to jquery, please do help me have a look at my codes, do not know why it is not working https://gist.github.com/1092116
[05:36:53] <boyka> hi there
[05:36:54] <Cork> bjhaid1: i don't think its the cause but your line 10 looks wrong
[05:37:14] <Cork> bjhaid1: your adding ?&after<value>
[05:37:49] <Cork> bjhaid1: and please define "not working"
[05:38:07] <bjhaid1> Cork: i tried that without the conditional statement and it worked, just would not pop-up the alert
[05:38:08] <Cork> (check your browsers error console and your rails logs
[05:38:57] <Cork> )
[05:39:53] <bjhaid1> Cork: the rails log is not getting a js request
[05:40:06] <quicksilver> bjhaid1:  if ('data-user' == 'data-exten') {
[05:40:12] <quicksilver> this is never true, surely?
[05:40:15] <quicksilver> those two strings are different.
[05:40:16] <Cork> heh
[05:40:50] <Cork> funny how you can turn a blind eye to some things :)
[05:41:11] <bjhaid1> quicksilver: they could be true, the 'data-user'  could be equal to 'data-exten', i actually made sure they were equal and did not get a pop-up
[05:41:16] <quicksilver> bjhaid1: no.
[05:41:28] <quicksilver> bjhaid1: 'data-user' can never, ever, be equal to 'data-exten'
[05:41:50] <quicksilver> bjhaid1: 'u' is a different letter from 'e', at position 6, for example ;)
[05:42:12] <quicksilver> probably you mean $('something').attr('data-user') == $('somethingelse').attr('data-exten')
[05:42:32] <bjhaid1> quicksilver: the values I assigned to them in my rails view, i want to check if certain rails variable are equal
[05:42:52] <quicksilver> incidentally using custom attributes (like data-exten etc) is not recommended and some browsers will reject them.
[05:42:54] <Cork> bjhaid1: you can't do that
[05:43:01] <quicksilver> bjhaid1: your javascript can't see your rails variables.
[05:43:05] <Cork> bjhaid1: javascript doens't have access to your rails code
[05:43:08] <quicksilver> bjhaid1: but 'data-user' is not a variable. It's a string!
[05:44:00] <bjhaid1> quicksilver: i was following a tutorial, where someone picked :call.last and data-time variable from rails
[05:44:24] <James-_> hello how can i put var on a change function as it ?
[05:44:40] <Cork> bjhaid1: you can echo the value from your rails variables and check the content
[05:44:40] <James-_> $('#article_admin_form_cat_video'.change(function()
[05:44:41] <James-_> 				var opt =  $("#article_admin_form_cat_video option:selected").text();
[05:44:41] <James-_> 				));
[05:45:01] <bjhaid1> Cork: okay
[05:45:14] <Cork> bjhaid1: if(<%= rv1.to_json %> == <%= rv2.to_json %>) {}
[05:45:28] <quicksilver> bjhaid1: I am unable to probably appreciate your level of misunderstanding here.
[05:45:29] <mrdjb> hey there.  how would i go about calling a function after all (ajax) functions in an each() have been executed ?
[05:45:32] <Cork> bjhaid1: but even better would be to make the check server side, and exclude the js if it fails
[05:45:34] <quicksilver> bjhaid1: 'data-user' is a string. it's that simple.
[05:45:46] <quicksilver> it's not a rails varaible nor a javascript variable. It's a string.
[05:46:01] <Cork> bjhaid1: just wrap your js code in a rails if statement, and don't include it if it fails
[05:46:27] <bjhaid1> quicksilver: i know what strings are, I am just a little confused, since I am not used to js
[05:46:28] <mrdjb> i.e. $('.something').each(function(){ something(); });
[05:46:36] <Cork> bjhaid1: no need to echo the data server side, and validate it client side
[05:46:53] <quicksilver> in ruby would you ever expect (if "hello" == "goodbye") to work?
[05:47:07] <bjhaid1> Cork: so rv1 would be my variable right?
[05:47:13] <Cork> yes
[05:47:24] <bjhaid1> Cork: in my rails view?
[05:47:35] <Cork> bjhaid1: yes, but as i said, better would be to just not send the js if it fails
[05:47:48] <Cork> less data and less work for everyone
[05:47:52] <bjhaid1> okay
[05:48:21] <mrdjb> i have to believe staggering asycnhronous functions is a common problem
[05:48:33] <James-_> $('#article_admin_form_cat_video'.change(function()
[05:48:33] <James-_> 				var opt =  $("#article_admin_form_cat_video option:selected").text();
[05:48:33] <James-_> 				));
[05:48:41] <James-_> how can i do that ?
[05:50:24] <mrdjb> any takers  ? :)
[05:50:38] <Cork> James-_: i might remember wrong, but i think you need to put what happens in change in a setTimeout, so that the select element gets updated
[05:50:50] <Cork> i might remember wrong and change isn't affected by that
[05:50:55] <Cork> + though
[05:51:28] <sadmicrowave> Cork, I don't think thats true
[05:51:46] <TeddyMurray> hey im using jqueryui slider -- how do i slide directly to an element within the slider?
[05:51:50] <koichirose> Hi, I have this function to filter items (which is not working on JSFiddle, I'm not sure why). http://jsfiddle.net/TVD2f/ - anyway, the problem is that with a bunch of stuff (300+ elements) it becomes VERY slow...any optimizations/fixes?
[05:51:55] <bjhaid1> Cork: if I want the page to reload at intervals that would be on the client-side right?
[05:52:06] <Cork> bjhaid1: yes
[05:52:17] <no-gooder> hey guys
[05:52:31] <Cork> bjhaid1: window.location.reload(); if that what you mean
[05:52:40] <no-gooder> i need to get left-bottom position of image
[05:52:40] <mrdjb> a solution i found is to get count of matching elements, then increment in function called in each(), that seems a little hokey
[05:52:49] <bjhaid1> Cork: okay, can i set a reload time, how often it reloads
[05:53:06] <Cork> bjhaid1: sure
[05:53:08] <TeddyMurray> any ideas?
[05:53:09] <no-gooder> how can i do it?
[05:53:21] <Cork> ?mdc setInterval @ bjhaid1
[05:53:23] <bot-t> bjhaid1, window.setInterval - MDN Docs - Calls a function repeatedly, with a fixed time delay between each call to that function. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setInterval
[05:53:38] <mrdjb> no-gooder: left, height
[05:54:16] <anavel> what's the best jquery tip plugin that works nicely with modal dialog ?
[05:54:22] <no-gooder> mrdjb, i used this var position = $(this).position();
[05:54:22] <no-gooder>  alert(position.left);
[05:54:25] <bjhaid1> Cork: so I wouldnt require setTimeout on the server side
[05:54:38] <no-gooder> mrdjb, can you send someple code ?
[05:54:45] <no-gooder> a sample code*
[05:54:46] <mrdjb> no
[05:54:57] <no-gooder> mrdjb, :S
[05:55:05] <Cork> anavel: i like beautytip
[05:55:16] <no-gooder> mrdjb, moron!
[05:55:32] <Cork> bjhaid1: setTimeout is javascript not server side
[05:55:33] <mrdjb> er.
[05:55:52] <anavel>  Cork, since you use it, any problem with it ? Like, it interfere with other component.
[05:55:54] <Cork> bjhaid1: and setTimeout and setInterval is basically the same thing, except that setTimeout just triggers one time
[05:56:32] <Cork> anakron: i have fiddled a bit with the code to work in relation to the dialog instead of to the main window
[05:56:36] <Cork> *anavel
[05:56:51] <bjhaid1> Cork: so say my backend receives a GET request from a webservice and I want to trigger a pop-up on my client-side, I use setInterval?
[05:56:52] <Cork> anavel: but it basically just means that with out it it stays put if you move the window
[05:56:56] <Cork> *dialog
[05:57:23] <Cork> bjhaid1: no, not at all
[05:57:31] <Cork> bjhaid1: in your return js.erb you just run your js code
[05:57:32] <anavel> Cork: i'll try. thanks
[05:58:13] <jeffsmykil> no one?
[05:58:24] <jeffsmykil> date time format for parse.date in safari?
[05:58:51] <sadmicrowave> James-_, sorry computer is running alittle sluggish this morning, just trying to save my fiddle now
[05:59:00] <Cork> jeffsmykil: your tested with the same format it outputs if you generate a current date?
[05:59:09] <Cork> or rather the same string
[05:59:10] <bjhaid1> Cork: so there's no way with jquery that I can get to trigger an effect on the client, from a GET request on the backend
[05:59:46] <Cork> bjhaid1: you have to think dual site when your doing web service
[06:00:02] <Cork> bjhaid1: you have server code, client code
[06:00:18] <Cork> and for them to tell each other any thing you have to have a get/put/post connection
[06:00:22] <bjhaid1> Cork: what I have thought of is to store the data in the server, and poll when a new update comes, and initiate a pop-up
[06:01:02] <bjhaid1> Cork: but the problem I have right now is getting the pop-up work on the client-side, after the polling is effected
[06:01:11] <jeffsmykil> Cork hard to know what its taking when all you get is the output
[06:02:28] <Cork> jefflembeck: var a = new Date(); console.log(a + '');
[06:02:54] <Cork> jefflembeck: just use that string and post it back to parse
[06:03:46] <Cork> bjhaid1: i think what you want is to do an ajax request to the server, and based on its responce show a dialog or not
[06:03:57] <Cork> ?.ajax @ bjhaid1
[06:03:58] <bot-t> bjhaid1, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:04:00] <Cork> but i gtg now
[06:04:04] <bjhaid1> thanks
[06:04:30] <jeffsmykil> cork yeah it posts a crazy date with day of the week etc
[06:04:39] <jeffsmykil> that would be a ton of code to figure out
[06:05:00] <jeffsmykil> Tue Jul 19 2011 09:04:03 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)
[06:05:25] <jeffsmykil> I would need to convert mm to mmm
[06:05:30] <jeffsmykil> and find out the day of the week
[06:06:44] <Anticom> hi all
[06:07:09] <Anticom> how can it be, that $_POST is empty in php, although firebug is telling me, that my ajax parameters have been posted using method "post" ??
[06:07:18] <jeffsmykil> i wonder if getDay would work in safari
[06:07:33] <Anticom> are there some known issues with $.ajax() ??
[06:07:41] <guy> any resource-friendly alternatives to jUI switchClass?
[06:08:00] <Anticom> guy: you mean .toggleClass() ??
[06:08:08] <guy> no. switchClass.
[06:08:16] <kborchers> guy: resource-friendly?
[06:08:21] <Anticom> and what would that do??
[06:08:34] <Anticom> @ guy
[06:08:35] <guy> well, kborchers well. my script dies only because of jQuery UI
[06:09:01] <kborchers> guy: dies? what dies?
[06:09:08] <guy> http://anuary.com/svn/hp/pad/index.html
[06:09:21] <guy> see the demo. see profiling results (you'l need to stop profiler yourself)
[06:12:01] <guy> dies == as in, "glitches the animation", "lags", "screams like bitch when kicked"
[06:13:04] <kborchers> guy: which animation is gliched or lagging? what browser?
[06:13:38] <Anticom> can't find anything either
[06:13:44] <Anticom> and what agend are you using
[06:13:48] <Anticom> agent*
[06:15:56] <guy> kborchers, Anticom: when dragging elements. Using IE6/7/8 (though ignore 6 for now.)
[06:16:24] <guy> I've might have spotted the issue with someone's help. "IE bug [..] basically if you change the CLASS of any domnoe, the ENTIRE DOM will be reparsed/rerendered"
[06:16:39] <guy> guys from #javascript pointed it out
[06:19:18] <Anticom> guy: i don't use ie :D
[06:19:35] <guy> it's pretty slow in modern browsers as well.
[06:19:40] <gf3> I only use IE
[06:20:06] <boyka> typeof($ || jQuery) === 'object'
[06:21:51] <kborchers> guy: it won't load at all for me in ie since you're using console there is a JS error
[06:22:03] <guy> well, I am debugging atm.
[06:22:20] <kborchers> sorry, took me a min to load my VM with IE
[06:22:36] <djcoin> Damn
[06:23:13] <djcoin> I used to work with the autocomplete plugin from jquery.ui and was able to see when the input was changed from the autocomplete (that set the result) or from the user input itself
[06:23:19] <djcoin> Now it does not work anymore
[06:23:35] <djcoin> I thought autocomplete would not trigger any 'change' event
[06:24:11] <djcoin> Im calling $(e.target).blur(), to make the focus espace from the autocomplete field as soon as the client choose something
[06:24:16] <djcoin> but this trigger a change
[06:24:33] <djcoin> And I have no way to check from which (autocomplete or pure user input) this comes from
[06:24:44] <djcoin> blur event triggering change evnet
[06:25:53] <kborchers> djcoin: why would you want to remove focus from the field after a choice is made? that is bad user experience, especially for keyboard only users.
[06:26:50] <djcoin> kborchers: Its the way I went in order to keep the final choice of the user
[06:27:12] <djcoin> if he chooses not to pick an item from the list
[06:27:21] <djcoin> It wont work
[06:27:32] <djcoin> So as soon as a choice is made I make him blur
[06:27:43] <djcoin> everytime he focused I can erase its last choice
[06:27:59] <djcoin> kborchers: How should I do that correctly ?
[06:28:39] <djcoin> Anyway, if he focus himself another field
[06:28:43] <djcoin> the change is triggered
[06:28:52] <djcoin> and I have no way to tell if its a valid input or not
[06:29:51] <Anticom> how do i have to return the response from the server when using ....html(function() { $.ajax({... success: function(response) { *i want to insert this as html* }}])); ???
[06:30:23] <Anticom> simply writing return response; in the success doesn't change the html at all =(
[06:30:25] <kborchers> djcoin: you should check out the combobox widget built on top of autocomplete http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[06:31:52] <kborchers> Anticom: that is wrong. you need to set the html from within success since it's asyncronous and won't have a value at the moment you are trying to set it.
[06:32:24] <Anticom> kborchers: thanks, silly me -.- :D
[06:33:47] <djcoin> kborchers: that looks good
[06:33:49] <djcoin> thanks
[06:34:01] <djcoin> anyhow, I will try to figure out how to solve my problem
[06:34:26] <kborchers> djcoin: yeah, if you don't want to use combobox, that should at least get you on the path to fixing your issue
[06:36:05] <jeffsmykil> my kingdom for a browser that actually emptys cache and refreshes when you tell it to
[06:36:15] <jeffsmykil> IE is the only one i can get to do it consistantly
[06:36:25] <sadmicrowave> ++jeffsmykil
[06:36:38] <sadmicrowave> how vast is your kingdom?
[06:36:39] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: how hard could it be?
[06:36:50] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: normal sized cube
[06:36:57] <sadmicrowave> I don't want that
[06:37:11] <jeffsmykil> I have three nerf guns in it
[06:37:15] <jeffsmykil> one of which is a rail gun!
[06:37:17] <sadmicrowave> OH HELL YEA
[06:37:45] <sadmicrowave> I have a nerf football in my office..fun for pegging passer-bys
[06:37:59] <jeffsmykil> I work with far to many engineers not to be strapping
[06:38:17] <sadmicrowave> lol, me too, where do you work, if you don't mind me asking
[06:38:43] <jeffsmykil> I am a designer at a startup that does RTLS for the medical field
[06:38:57] <jeffsmykil> in NH
[06:39:07] <sadmicrowave> nice
[06:39:33] <jeffsmykil> and i learned js over the past few months because i was sick of engineers telling me that they couldnt do that, or they wouldnt do that
[06:40:39] <sadmicrowave> yea, my corporate platform was/is IE6, so for awhile I did a lot of cross browser testing, then I just said.....f-that IE sucks, if you want to use my site you will use FF
[06:41:00] <jeffsmykil> i was able to convince them to use IE 7 as a baseline
[06:41:08] <sadmicrowave> too much precious time wasted on a browser few people use and sucks a great deal
[06:41:13] <jeffsmykil> unfortunately hospitals use old shit
[06:41:26] <sadmicrowave> my company is too global for me to have a say in what corporate chooses
[06:41:59] <jeffsmykil> thats about the only say Ive ever had
[06:42:09] <jeffsmykil> the lead engineer is a total d-bag
[06:43:09] <jeffsmykil> one of those pretentious fucks you just want to kick in the teeth
[06:43:13] <sadmicrowave> well, fortunately I get to set the rules as far as web design at my plant since I am the only designer in the team
[06:43:36] <jeffsmykil> yeah they htink they get a say in ux stuff, and usually design without me
[06:43:40] * jeffsmykil shakes his fist
[06:43:51] <jeffsmykil> the back end is all asp, so not much i can do
[06:44:09] <sadmicrowave> fun
[06:44:11] <guy> how to bind on elements that have elm.data('foo').bar === true?
[06:44:20] <sadmicrowave> bind to what?
[06:44:36] <metap0d> Hi everyone, if I have an unordered list with an unordered list inside one of the list items (to make a sub menu). I want to make it so that if a user hovers over that embedded list the hover state is still active on the parent. Anyone have any tips?
[06:44:38] <guy> bind event to an element* selected using the above rule?
[06:45:21] <sadmicrowave> guy, I think your selector is a bit wrong, the .bar seems out of place
[06:46:20] <guy> basically this is what I want to do
[06:46:20] <guy> $.hp.ul.find('li').filter(function(){ if($(this).data('video').centered === true) return true }).live('click', [..]);
[06:46:36] <guy> will it work?
[06:47:31] <sadmicrowave> try it, does it work?
[06:47:50] <nddery> Hey!
[06:48:03] <guy> it will work, but will it work as I expect? note the .live()
[06:49:01] <sadmicrowave> probably not
[06:49:08] <guy> I see.
[06:51:22] <sadmicrowave> guy, so your wondering how to use .live() or if putting your event handler at the end of your selector chain will work?
[06:51:47] <guy> I am wondering how to bind live() so that filter() wouldn't get ignored
[06:52:04] <guy> (once the data() has changed)
[06:52:11] <sadmicrowave> try putting your event handler first like this $('someelement').live('click',function(){
[06:52:28] <sadmicrowave> then put your .filter() line within that as a variable or an if or whatever
[06:52:40] <guy> sadmicrowave: that's actually it!
[06:53:16] <sadmicrowave> thats how it is now?

[07:11:49] <burg> hello. let`s say i have a plugin and i want to call it on an element, like: $('#elem').plugin() -- how can i do that if the #elem does not exist at the beginning?
[07:12:27] <danzik17> burg: when does it exist?
[07:12:29] <kborchers> burg: call it after you add the element?
[07:13:37] <burg> i am going to display the new element in a modal box (with ajax request)
[07:14:11] <kborchers> burg: then call it in the success of the ajax req after you add the element
[07:14:35] <magical1> I think I have got most of the way on my cookie problem ... I am just not sure how to get it to use the cookie to set the initial visibility state ... I have put my code up on jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/RqZP6/5/ thx in advance
[07:14:48] <burg> and i am using this plugin: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/ (the one that i want to call)
[07:15:37] <guy> $.hp.li_elements.not(li).data('video').centered	= false;
[07:16:02] <guy> so... this doesn't set this data to each element, and instead sets it to the selected elements group?
[07:16:09] <kborchers> burg: ok, still, what i said above
[07:18:21] <burg> kborchers, i did that already. no success
[07:18:34] <no-gooder>  guys. i get the id of element but i need t use dynamicly thet id to change some attribute of element. like var x= $(this).id;  $(x).css({visibility: "hidden"});
[07:18:38] <no-gooder> how can i do that ?
[07:18:46] <kborchers> ?demo @ burg
[07:18:47] <bot-t> burg, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:19:14] <blup> is there a way to get the ORIGINAL dimensions of an image (before css style changes its dimensions)?
[07:19:32] <burg> kborchers http://codepad.org/h8K6MGvj
[07:20:29] <DragonL> Hi all, I am dynamically altering css something like this: $('head').append('<link href="new.css">') It visibly works, but afterwards this still prints the original css value: alert($('body').css('color')) Is this by design or did I miss something?
[07:20:38] <blup> nevermind, found my answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/318630/get-real-image-width-and-height-with-javascript-in-safari-chrome
[07:21:33] <geekbuntu> does anyone know if jquery adopted this plugin (integrated it)? http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDIQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fjquery-json%2F&rct=j&q=jquery%20.json&ei=MZIlTr_JKOWr0AH15dy8Cg&usg=AFQjCNEAZrdKpmtIyWN2dIn7fNbgswNyfA&sig2=UAto3lH3uRMEEMK--fg5AA&cad=rja
[07:22:04] <geekbuntu> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/
[07:22:09] <geekbuntu> weird... wasn't that long in person
[07:22:10] <geekbuntu> o.0
[07:24:22] <kborchers> burg: i have not used colorbox but reading the doc, i don't think you have loaded anything via ajax. i don't think href does that for you. what does $(this) refer to in that code?
[07:25:09] <burg> kborchers, firebug tells me that i do load. the fact that i see the content also makes me know that i did load content via ajax
[07:26:12] <kborchers> burg: hmmm, and you get no error trying to initialize that ajaxForm plugin?
[07:26:29] <burg> no. it just doesn`t work
[07:26:42] <DragonL> no-gooder: var x = $(this).attr('id'); $('#' + x).css({visibility: "hidden"});
[07:27:01] <kborchers> have you tried logging $('#add-client') to see if you're actually selecting the object?
[07:27:20] <beatpanda> are $("#whatever") and document.getElementById('whatever') completely equivalent? Because I have a situation where the native JS works but the jQuery selector doesn't, and I was wondering why.
[07:28:11] <timing> beatpanda: what is the situation?
[07:28:39] <timing> I think $() uses document.querySelector if possible
[07:28:42] <beatpanda> trying to use the stepUp method on an html5 range input. getElementById works but jQuery selector doesn't.
[07:29:05] <timing> beatpanda: how do you see if it works or not?
[07:29:39] <timing> $() doesn't return a dom element
[07:29:50] <beatpanda> it's bound to a keypress. if it works, the handle on the slider moves. if it doesn't work, the handle stays put. and in any case, the console is throwing "$("#whatever").stepUp() is not a function" errors
[07:30:05] <beatpanda> ok, that makes a difference
[07:30:28] <beatpanda> so there would have to be a jQuery wrapper for stepUp(), I take it
[07:31:31] <timing> yeah create a jquery plugin
[07:31:40] <timing> I think it can be rather small
[07:31:57] <DragonL> beatpanda: or just call .get() to get the dom element?
[07:32:18] <beatpanda> meh. the extra syntax isn't really that bad, not worth the extra overhead of loading a plugin I don't think. Could I chain .get().stepUp()?
[07:32:43] <beatpanda> (checking)
[07:32:52] <DragonL> I think so
[07:33:27] <beatpanda> nope
[07:33:48] <DragonL> "not a function"?
[07:34:22] <beatpanda> yep
[07:34:40] <beatpanda> same thing if I do whatever = $("whatever").get()
[07:35:14] <Rushing> cause get returns the actual element
[07:35:18] <Rushing> i think you want eq()
[07:35:23] <Rushing> or first()
[07:36:13] <sphinxxx> whats the best way to remove all duplicates in a comma delimeted string?
[07:36:15] <Rushing> $("whatever").get(0) is essentially the same as $("whatever")[0]
[07:36:35] <Rushing> ?map @ sphinxxx
[07:36:36] <bot-t> sphinxxx, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[07:36:36] <guy> I can't track down what's causing the syntax error in IE
[07:36:39] <guy> http://anuary.com/svn/hp/pad/index.html
[07:36:40] <guy> $.hp.li_elements.animate($.hp.class.li, 300);
[07:36:43] <guy> it says the problem is in this line
[07:36:49] <Protomega> Okay so I have been searching the DOM and I found out that before editing. the links constructor is Window { } and after editing it is HTMLAnchorElement. My problem is that after I edit it, I can't use any edit link again.
[07:37:15] <Protomega> Like, once I open the dialog box once, it won't let me reopen it.
[07:37:17] <grid_> i wanted to link a javascript event show(); to a hyperlink, i wanted to link it to the cross (which will hide it) of the modal popup of http://jqframework.com/jqpopup_demo.html there is now <div id="sampleformdiv_px" class="jqpopup_cross"></div>, can someone help?
[07:37:37] <grid_> i really have no clue where to begin
[07:37:41] <sadmicrowave> guy, how are you trying to do the animation? moving the element to a position? resizing the element?
[07:37:55] <beatpanda> neither eq() nor first() did it either. (it's also not a big deal, I just wanted to know why.) Thanks!
[07:37:55] <nvictor> hey all
[07:38:09] <guy> sadmicrowave: eh? how is this related to the question? it is a syntax error that I am experiencing.
[07:38:15] <nvictor> can you use wildchars in jquery selector with an attribute pattern?
[07:38:34] <Rushing> sphinxxx, or just do... var uniques = []; $.each(allofem, function(i, item){ if($.inArray(item, uniques) < 0) uniques.push(item); });
[07:38:41] <nvictor> $('name[attr=*bc]') ?
[07:39:00] <sphinxxx> thx rushing ill try that
[07:39:13] <sadmicrowave> guy, its related to the question because i don't think you can reference an element inside the animate function like that. you need an action like .animate({left: '200px'}, 500)
[07:39:22] <Rushing> beatpanda, i'm not sure what your original problem was. i was just talking about why you'd get "not a function" with get().stepUp()
[07:39:27] <Protomega> sadmicrowave, a while back you asked for my code. http://pastebin.com/BRHzcd46
[07:39:28] <sadmicrowave> or .animate({width: '200px'}, 500)
[07:39:31] <guy> that works fine.
[07:39:52] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, yes I did
[07:40:05] <Protomega> Sorry for such a late response lol
[07:40:06] <beatpanda> Rushing: the problem was there's no jQuery wrapper for stepUp() or stepDown(), basically. You need to get the element in native JS for either method to work.
[07:40:06] <sadmicrowave> but that was days ago
[07:40:08] <gf3> gf31: NO U
[07:40:21] <Protomega> There is the code if you are still up for looking at it.
[07:40:27] <Protomega> If not I understand.
[07:40:32] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, and you had already sent it to me
[07:40:41] <Protomega> I did?
[07:40:51] <kborchers> nvictor: sort of, but probably not the way you're thinking see ?selectors
[07:40:52] <bot-t> nvictor, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1ñ3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[07:41:18] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, yes, and I couldn't figure out the problem, I think i told you that this is one of those problems where unless I see the working example I'm not going to be much help
[07:41:35] <Protomega> Ah okay give me like.. two seconds
[07:42:12] <Protomega> https://vp5b.showoff.io/
[07:42:25] <sedawk> how do I iterate throught <a> in a jquery html object?
[07:42:31] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, run me through the problem again, its been awhile
[07:43:06] <Protomega> Okay under either part or bin, it doesn't matter which. I can edit something, but afterwards it won't let me edit anything else.
[07:43:32] <Protomega> I will click the button but nothing will happen.
[07:43:43] <Protomega> Now I did notice that there was a change in constructor before and after click.
[07:44:00] <Protomega> Before it was Window { } and after it was HTMLAnchorElement
[07:45:32] <sejo> hey all, Is it possible to get the exact html code starting from element-x to element-y (those aren't always siblings)
[07:46:15] <Rushing> sejo, not easily. what are you trying to do?
[07:47:12] <sejo> Rushing: I want someone to select a start and an end, and then display the html between and including the start and end element in a textarea
[07:47:20] <fruitwerks> anyone ever work with google data feeds and authsub?
[07:47:47] <sejo> I do that with an chrome extention I can select the start and end, but can't get the html in between
[07:47:55] <Rushing> sejo, the problem is that outerHTML is not standardized accross browsers, so you can only get the innerHTML
[07:47:55] <guy> sadmicrowave: it seems that if I enter animate() rules directly, it works fine. though, I need to use object.
[07:48:02] <Rushing> so what you should probably do is something liek this:
[07:48:10] <guy> how do I go about it? I don't want to type in the same rule 100 times
[07:48:11] <Protomega> sadmicrowave, do you need me to do another showoff?
[07:48:44] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, no no
[07:49:20] <Rushing> var $tmp = $("<div/>"); var $nodes = $(".things").slice(1, 5).clone().appendTo($tmp); var html = $tmp.html();
[07:49:20] <sadmicrowave> guy, again, how are you trying to animate the element? alittle more relevant now huh?
[07:49:30] <Rushing> sejo ^^^^
[07:50:06] <sejo> Rushing: well I dont have the nodes, I want to be able to find the nodes between 2 nodes
[07:50:25] <Rushing> then they'd have to be siblings
[07:50:29] <Rushing> ?nextUntil @ sejo
[07:50:29] <bot-t> sejo, .nextUntil([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[07:50:53] <sejo> Rushing: ach but they aren't necessarely siblings
[07:50:55] <guy> sadmicrowave: no it is not relevant at all. Basically: $.hp.class.li = {top: 100}; and what I do is $.hp.li_elements.animate($.hp.class.li, 300); though! if I do var foo = {top: 100}; $.hp.li_elements.animate(foo, 300);
[07:50:58] <guy> it works fine in IE
[07:51:08] <sedawk> If I have a html stored in a variable, how do I iterate through the LI elements in the variable, please help.
[07:51:23] <Rushing> sejo, then there is no direct path of elements "between" them
[07:51:48] <Rushing> you could start by finding a common ancestor and then get the siblings between
[07:51:53] <guy> sejo: $('<ul><li></ul>').find('li', function(){ $(this).[..] })
[07:51:58] <sejo> no you only know the start and end, and end might be a sibling or a sibling of one of the start's parents
[07:52:07] <guy> sedawk:  $('<ul><li></ul>').find('li', function(){ $(this).[..] })
[07:52:31] <Rushing> ok, then like i said, find an ancestor of one of those deeper elements that is a sibling of the other element
[07:52:34] <Protomega> sadmicrowave, the isContentEditable in the DOM disappears after clicking.
[07:52:37] <Protomega> editing*
[07:52:47] <sejo> guy: It's not only with ul/li it can be a p or a div or whatever
[07:53:00] <guy> sejo: the answer was meant to sedawk.
[07:53:03] <Rushing> ?parentUntil @ sejo
[07:53:05] <bot-t> sejo, .parent() - Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[07:53:08] <sejo> ach sorry
[07:53:12] <nvictor> what happens when select a jquery element?
[07:53:17] <no-gooder> Dragonl , oh thank you
[07:53:17] <sedawk> thanks all
[07:53:25] <nvictor> $($('el'))?
[07:53:25] <sejo> Rushing: ok so I need to write an algorithm with selectors
[07:53:31] <sejo> Rushing: ok thanks
[07:53:34] <no-gooder> DragonL
[07:53:42] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, oh wait, your showoff broke
[07:53:45] <sadmicrowave> make another one
[07:53:47] <Protomega> mmk
[07:54:04] <Protomega> https://mxmd.showoff.io/
[07:54:58] <Rushing> sejo, yeah, something lik if p and div2 are selected and p is a child of div1 and div2 is a sibling of div1, div1.nextUntil...
[07:55:39] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, the editing breaks even if you hit 'cancel' on the edit popup
[07:55:44] <Protomega> Yea
[07:55:55] <Protomega> Something is screwing with it
[07:55:56] <sadmicrowave> so that leads me to believe its not any of the callbacks
[07:56:02] <sadmicrowave> its happening before any of that takes place
[07:56:43] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, take the 'return false' out of the updateClick() function
[07:57:28] <Protomega> Now the window popped up but then immediately refreshes the page
[07:59:38] <Protomega> sadmicrowave, want it back up again?
[07:59:43] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, why do you have 2 of each of these: updateClick(), formCreate(), and formUpdate...thats a problem...
[07:59:59] <Protomega> I have two?
[08:00:11] <sadmicrowave> I'm looking at your .js
[08:00:13] <Protomega> Probably on two different pages.
[08:00:25] <Protomega> But it probably combines them because of the ajax
[08:00:54] <Protomega> Well.. Let's see what happens when I take one of them out
[08:01:33] <Protomega> Nope. :|
[08:02:11] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, ok, put it back up now with those extra functions taken out...any ways you can make the showoff not time out?
[08:02:22] <magical1> nevermind .. I worked it out!
[08:02:33] <Protomega> No, I left my card at home so I can't get a one day pass sorry lol
[08:03:16] <Protomega> https://eqbm.showoff.io/
[08:03:51] <guy> guys, the script crashes the browser (IE7/8). any ideas? http://anuary.com/svn/hp/pad/index.html
[08:04:22] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, hmm it must be showoff that is duplicating the functions
[08:04:27] <sadmicrowave> because I still see them
[08:04:51] <Protomega> Hmm. Or it could be me not knowing what I'm doing.
[08:05:34] <Protomega> Maybe I should try and rewrite this so that it is more reusable and see if the problem gets fixed?
[08:05:44] <Patatouf> hi ! how can i select every child/parent of an element when i clicked on it ?
[08:06:14] <sadmicrowave> while your at it dont use variables like z,x,y for defining strings and elements, its hard to help when I have to decipher those
[08:06:34] <Protomega> hehe, I'll make the next try a lot more legible
[08:06:36] <Patatouf> for example would something like $('#elem').click(function() { this.child(... work ?
[08:06:43] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, plus, when you look back at your code later it will confuse you also
[08:06:44] <Protomega> Got an example of what I should use?
[08:06:56] <Rushing> Patatouf, $(".something").click(function(){ var stuff = $(this).children().add($(this).parents()); });
[08:07:34] <Patatouf> Rushing: thx !
[08:07:58] <Patatouf> Rushing: and if i want to "toggle" each of them, i have to use a foreach ?
[08:08:29] <phlp> guy: my ie8 says $.hp is undefined
[08:08:59] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, yea, like here:  formUpdate($(this).parents("#editPartForm"), $(this).parents("tr"));    formUpdate( $pDialog, $tr )
[08:09:12] <guy> phlp: ho can it be. you see the code yourself + it works on all other browsers.
[08:09:30] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, the $ in the variable definition signifies that it is an element, and the 'p' signifies that it is private to that function
[08:09:31] <Rushing> Patatouf, no, you can just do stuff.slideToggle() or something
[08:09:50] <Patatouf> Rushing: ok, i'll have a try. Thx.
[08:09:58] <Rushing> but html and body are also parents of every element, so you'll be toggling the entire page basically
[08:09:59] <Protomega> mmk, I'll start redoing the code. I'll be back later.
[08:10:05] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, little things like that help, you can devise your own usually though, 'i' prefix for integers, 'c' prefixes for character strings
[08:11:31] <guy> phlp: mind helping me to investigate this?
[08:14:18] <guy> anyone?
[08:15:00] <phlp> what is it that you are trying to animate? looks like you are just passing 'best' to animate
[08:16:18] <guy> phlp: no, I was just testing here. I've restored the code. see now.
[08:16:59] <guy> I am trying to animate this:
[08:17:00] <guy> {left: 0, top: 81, width: 394, height: 255, margin: '0 12px'}
[08:17:06] <madprops> any idea how facebook manages to keep the chat visible when redirecting?
[08:17:27] <guy> madprops: frames?
[08:17:37] <madprops> guy, that's the only way?
[08:17:44] <davidangel> can anyone help me with a syntax error: http://pastebin.com/6K7ayV86
[08:17:47] <guy> madprops: yes
[08:17:59] <scar2> madprops: any idea how to remove the flippin sidebar and return to the old i wanna see my chat list"
[08:18:00] <scar2> lol
[08:18:13] <phlp> guy: use marginLeft marginTop etc.
[08:18:13] <sadmicrowave> davidangel, which line is the syntax error on?
[08:18:57] <madprops> guy, im talking about the individual chat windows, those can't be frames since they overlap the main window or can they/
[08:18:58] <guy> phlp: updated the code.
[08:19:56] <davidangel> sadmicrowave: 1: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[08:20:09] <guy> davidangel: you don't escape the code. use line-end\
[08:20:29] <sadmicrowave> davidangel, nevermind I see it, your quotes are off, everything inside .after() is wrapped in single quotes '' but your php echo is doing return_rf_info('slider_image') so you just broke the quote in that spot
[08:21:05] <davidangel> sadmicrowave: o for crying out loud, thanks a bunch
[08:21:16] <sadmicrowave> davidangel, guy said the same thing
[08:21:26] <sadmicrowave> fyi
[08:21:36] <davidangel> oh okay
[08:21:42] <davidangel> well thanks to both of you then
[08:21:43] <guy> phlp: are you with me?
[08:22:40] <sadmicrowave> davidangel, also, when you get a php error like the one you got, that will best be served in the ##php channel
[08:22:56] <phlp> guy: yes i'm looking at it but you've got a ton of code here. what change caused the issue?
[08:23:23] <anavel> how to get index of an <option> with specific value ?
[08:23:40] <guy> phlp: I've had to move from jQuery-UI switchClass to animate() [perfomance issues]
[08:24:14] <guy> that's the only change I did
[08:24:54] <sadmicrowave> anavel, $("select option[value='searched_value']").index();
[08:25:05] <anavel> thanks
[08:25:27] <guy> omg. found it.
[08:25:44] <guy> phlp: JShint got me an idea what's wrong: class is a reserved keyword
[08:25:53] <guy> (in IE only, of course.)
[08:26:36] <eddiemonge> guy it should be considered one in every browser
[08:26:53] <guy> well, no other browser complained.
[08:27:21] <eddiemonge> guy http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Reserved_Words
[08:28:54] <guy> IE shouldn't worry about the future in the first place: there is not future for IE.
[08:30:48] <jedimind> except that it's STILL the most used browser in the world by quite a bit
[08:30:52] <phlp> looks like ff4 doesnt complain for any keyword as an object property which is what yours was
[08:30:55] <jedimind> but sure, you tell yourself whatever makes you feel better
[08:37:07] <davock> Hi guys
[08:37:38] <phlp> hello
[08:38:38] <davock> do you  know about any jquery extension for sending forms trough ajax
[08:39:38] <timing> davock: I think that's native functionality
[08:39:45] <timing> uhh *standard functionality
[08:39:48] <timing> not native :-)
[08:40:32] <kborchers> ?ajax @ devock
[08:40:32] <bot-t> devock, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:40:55] <kborchers> davock ^^^
[08:41:09] <GeO`> I'm working with a UI progressbar
[08:41:09] <kborchers> ?post @ davock
[08:41:10] <bot-t> davock, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[08:41:37] <GeO`> I want the background color to be like a health bar : green when it's full, red when empty, and yellow in the middle
[08:41:47] <GeO`> but I want it smooth, not with tresholds
[08:41:50] <GeO`> how can I do that?
[08:42:38] <davock> Sorry , I didn't ask clearly. I need a extension to serialize a html form, send it trough ajax and then get the response, I was using  jquery form   http://jquery.malsup.com/form/  but has some bugs on IE
[08:43:38] <kborchers> ?serialize @ davock
[08:43:39] <bot-t> davock, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[08:44:41] <davock> It works pretty fine for me when i'm sending  common  html inputs, but I got some trouble with file uploading
[08:44:49] <davidangel> If I am selecting like ".class:last" and then adding that same class to a .after() does that cause problems?
[08:45:44] <DJTrey> can someone please explain why my dropdown isn't disabling when the ajax comes back successfully? The $(this) works fine at the top to get the memberid value. http://jsfiddle.net/axagh/
[08:46:16] <GeO`> any ideas for my issue?
[08:46:52] <davock> serialize() + post()  work fine in the common cases, the trouble is if my form has file upload fields, the extension i'm using tries to handle with file uploading but fails on IE   http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#file-upload
[08:47:46] <kborchers> davock: you didn't mention files. you'll have to use some tricks there with an iframe http://www.phpletter.com/Our-Projects/AjaxFileUpload/
[08:48:56] <davock> kbochers , actually, the extension I'm using uses that trick http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#file-upload  but it doesn't work fine on IE,   when i get the request response on IE the text response seems to be corrupted
[08:49:11] <davock> like the IE iframe functionality brokes the HTML
[09:02:33] <fourcolors> Hi, can someone help me understand what this line of code is doing? $('select', $(this).parent()).attr('value')
[09:02:46] <fourcolors> I don't understand the $('select', $(this).parent()) part ...
[09:02:49] <brentbizzle> i need some help adding some css on the fly if anyone can take a look at some code
[09:03:08] <fourcolors> I also can't find documentation on it
[09:03:11] <fourcolors> so i'm confused
[09:03:44] <bittyx-laptop> http://ustedienergiju.levacic.net/enegropedia <--- when you click on the section B, a div slides down to reveal some items. however, as soon as the animation starts, section C drops down to where it's supposed to be *after* the animation. is there any way to make it go down smoothly as section B's contents are revealing?
[09:04:27] <brentbizzle> bitty, 404
[09:04:31] <kborchers> fourcolors: that is selecting all select elements and the parent of the current context element then it gets the values of all of those. that's a weird one, what is it used for?
[09:04:36] <brentbizzle> not that i can help
[09:04:50] <kasunLak> hi all, I have some strange issue with my ajax call to localhost. from the same html i can call to a remote server and get the things done but nothing happens when I call to my localhost. any help?
[09:04:54] <bittyx-laptop> fourcolors: it selects "select" elements that are children of the parent of the current element
[09:05:13] <bittyx-laptop> brentbizzle: sorry, http://ustedienergiju.levacic.net/energopedia <-- this is the correct link
[09:06:34] <fourcolors> kborchers: it's being used to style this select dropdown http://pastie.org/private/1sgb1p1bsfwfsgmril2eeq
[09:07:10] <brentbizzle> has anyone had trouble adding css to returned html from an ajax call?
[09:07:10] <fourcolors> The problem is, the current javascript uses the "value" as the display when something is selected but it should be using the text between the <option> tags
[09:07:51] <brentbizzle> the css is applied correctly on page load, but when the page changes using ajax, the css isn't getting applied to the new data
[09:08:11] <brentbizzle> as far as I can tell, the html is correct
[09:09:05] <phlp> fourcolors: jQuery(selector, [context]) is the doc you're looking for http://api.jquery.com/jQuery#selector-context
[09:09:43] <fourcolors> oh cool thanks phlp that helps a ton
[09:10:03] <bittyx-laptop> hmm, if i use the effect 'blind' instead of 'slide', the other items slide correctly across the page, but with 'slide', they just jump instantly to their target positions
[09:10:34] <kborchers> fourcolors: ok, that is still just weird but this is what to change. change .html(this.value); to .html(this.children(":selected").text());
[09:11:50] <rosieres> Hi, I¥m making a menu . . . I¥m changing some css values at runtime. Could I import these values from a predefined css sheet ? And how do I that !!
[09:13:06] <ryanneufeld> yes, use different classes for different states
[09:13:12] <fourcolors> kborchers: yup that did the trick. Just had to change this to $(this).  Ok so to follow the logic, I am running through all of the children elements that are ":selected" and grabbing the text from them and inserting into the html
[09:14:45] <brentbizzle> rosieres, you can just import all the css and add, remove classes on the fly
[09:14:56] <hdnine> Hey everyone! Not very used to how IRC works but i have a small problem with the plugin "Tablesorter" if anyone can help. It works great until i installo the "Contact Form 7" plugin for Wordpress so somehow the conflict, any ideas?
[09:15:20] <marianoguerra> hi, anyone knows if there is a known reason to receive xhr (the first parameter) as undefined in beforeSend?
[09:15:25] <marianoguerra> jquery 1.6.2
[09:15:25] <kborchers> fourcolors: yes, though there should only be one selected. still not sure why you do $('select', $(this).parent()).attr('value') instead of just $(this).children("select").val() or even $("select[name='sel1']").val()
[09:15:45] <ryanneufeld> hdnine: chances are you have conflicting JS.
[09:16:02] <jrockjiggz> marianoguerra: post your code
[09:16:09] <hdnine> rya: Yes okej... any way for me to remedy this in a simple way?
[09:16:13] <fourcolors> kborchers: this is a design I got sliced by someone in Ukraine.. so I'm just doing the back end work :p
[09:16:15] <jrockjiggz> marianoguerra: sorry not u lol
[09:16:24] <fourcolors> kborchers: not sure why he did that either lol
[09:16:36] <jrockjiggz> hdnine: post your code
[09:16:43] <hdnine> Moment
[09:16:57] <fourcolors> kborchers: I think ill go through and clean the code up a bit
[09:17:23] <kborchers> fourcolors: i would probably use my first suggested replacement as the second one is probably a bit of a perf hit
[09:18:00] <fourcolors> right thank you for the help
[09:18:05] <kborchers> np
[09:18:29] <hdnine> This is the code i use on the table: jQuery(document).ready(function() {  jQuery("#browse_result").tablesorter({ widgets: ['zebra'], headers: { 0: { textExtraction: function(node)	{	return node.innerHTML;	 }}	} });   });
[09:18:33] <hdnine> Really hard to read
[09:18:51] <hdnine> But like i said... i worked before i installed Contact Form
[09:19:10] <kborchers> hdnine: please don't paste code like that here. see ?p
[09:19:11] <bot-t> hdnine, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:19:45] <hdnine> Mmm i saw that... sorry
[09:21:27] <hdnine> Ok, one more try http://jsfiddle.net/hdnine/F8LtB/ =)
[09:23:21] <phlp> wcf is so hard to work with.. its unreal
[09:23:42] <hdnine> So, like i said, there is some sort of conflict between "Tablesorter" and "Contact Form 7" since Tablesorters functionality stops
[09:25:17] <bittyx-laptop> http://jsfiddle.net/PE8UV/ <--- okay i'm having trouble with this. if you CLICK(1), a div is revealed, but the divs below all "jump" down to make room immediately. if you CLICK(2), a div is revealed, and the div below smoothly moves down. however, the first effect is what i need (the lower part of the hidden div to be visible first), whereas, with the second effect, the hidden div is in it's place - it doesn't actually slide in, but it is simpl
[09:25:17] <bittyx-laptop> y revealed.
[09:25:21] <bittyx-laptop> how do i resolve this?
[09:25:48] <hdnine> I have it live on my site if that would help? http://www.tepg.se/browse/  - I just today installed Contact Form and now the table under my "browse" section doesn't work anymore =(
[09:29:04] <eddiemonge> bittyx-laptop: you mean like this: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/PE8UV/1/?
[09:29:52] <eddiemonge> hdnine: 35Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'tablesorter'
[09:29:57] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: nope - when .show('slide') is used, you can see how the bottom of the previously hidden div appears first
[09:30:09] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: but 'slide' forces the divs below to drop instantly
[09:30:19] <eddiemonge> bittyx-laptop: did you look at my example?
[09:30:36] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: yes - it's basically the same as .show('blind') from my example
[09:30:44] <hdnine> Eddie: Ok... i will try to understand and sort it out. Thanks =)
[09:30:52] <eddiemonge> bittyx-laptop: so why cant you use what i put?
[09:30:53] <hdnine> Not sure what that means but... =D
[09:31:39] <eddiemonge> hdnine: you are including the tablesorter script after you are trying to call it
[09:31:43] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: can you see in my example the two differences between 'slide' and 'blind' ? the first difference is the smoothness of movement ('slide' causes jumping of other elements, 'blind' smoothly moves them down)
[09:32:18] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: the second difference is - with 'blind', the hidden element is revealed, but it is not moved down from the upper element - it behaves like it was behind the lower element at first
[09:32:32] <kborchers> hdnine: it looks like you are trying to call tablesorter in functions.js but jquery.tablesorter.min.js isn't included until after functions.js
[09:32:40] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: while with 'slide' it behaves like it was hidden behind the element that was clicked on, and slides down into it's place
[09:33:18] <hdnine> Eddie: Ahhh... strange that it worked before i installed Conttact Form 7? Super thanks anyways =)
[09:33:52] <hdnine> Thanks to kborchers tooo
[09:36:13] <hdnine> Hmm i tried to change the order the are loaded in my header-file but that didn't do anything. I realize that JS is very perticular when it comes to right order of things...
[09:37:59] <eddiemonge> yes it is
[09:38:05] <brentbizzle> has anyone been able to apply css to ajax returned html?
[09:38:35] <hdnine> Can anyone recommend another equally good Contact Form for WP... maybe another one will work better with Tablesorter?
[09:38:37] <sapht> hey, i'm looking to couple a class to each item of a specific selector. i see this used in some plugins i.e $("#jp").jPlayer(...); what should i google for?
[09:39:16] <sapht> by class i mean a javascript class instance
[09:39:20] <eddiemonge> bittyx-laptop: its the difference between slide and blind. slide is supposed to move in where blind is like blinds on a window
[09:39:24] <kborchers> hdnine: not sure if this will fix your issue but it also looks like you have a second jQuery(document).ready(function() { around your tablesorter call, take that out
[09:39:31] <Michael> javascript class, huh?
[09:39:32] <eddiemonge> hdnine: just fix your include order
[09:39:59] <kborchers> eddiemonge: he did fix and still broken
[09:40:03] <eddiemonge> sapht: you mean you want to create a jquery plugin?
[09:40:09] <sapht> Michael: alright i mean an object designed to act like a class instance
[09:40:19] <Michael> prototype :D
[09:40:42] <hdnine> eddie: I will do that, thank you
[09:40:48] <sapht> eddiemonge: i'm not sure, but i feel the need to have the instance tied to the dom
[09:41:03] <eddiemonge> hdnine: the problem i see now are the two jquery includes on the page
[09:41:28] <eddiemonge> sapht: so you want $('selector').myCoolFunction() ?
[09:41:29] <sapht> i'll google jquery plugins, ty
[09:41:34] <sapht> eddiemonge: yeah, precisely
[09:41:43] <sapht> which should do stuff based on data from $('selector')
[09:41:52] <eddiemonge> ?writing a plugin @ sapht
[09:41:54] <bot-t> sapht, Plugins/Authoring - jQuery offers a mechanism for adding in methods and functionality, bundled as plugins. Most of the methods and functions included in the default download are written using the jQuery plugin construct. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[09:42:15] <eddiemonge> hdnine: or wordpress itself
[09:42:17] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: yeah, but i'd like the 'slide' effect functionality, but without the divs below jumping down, but rather, i want them to slide down as well while the hidden div is sliding out (just like they do when the 'blinds' method is used)
[09:42:40] <dethkrieg> I'm trying to customize the datepicker (JQuery UI) with a date range that allows Month and Year dropdowns, see example: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#date-range
[09:42:44] <eddiemonge> bittyx-laptop: so use the blind method?
[09:42:55] <dethkrieg> the month dropdown works, but the year dropdown only shows 2011
[09:43:37] <kasunLak> I am using this http://pastie.org/2238042  to call to localhost and there is no response or no tomcat log even (I am in file:// so no cross domain issues) but when I replace url with http://nightly2.sakaiproject.org:8087/direct/session  its working
[09:44:10] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: i'm sorry, but are you misunderstanding what i'm trying to do? 'blind' doesn't work for me because it shows the top of the hidden object first. basically, i want the object to appear to slide in from the top (it's an important difference in my case) - i just want all the content below it to slide smoothly as well, instead of jumping
[09:46:37] <eddiemonge> hdnine: please stop pm'ing me. all your questions can/should be stated here. is that contact form a wordpress plugin?
[09:47:02] <hdnine> Oh is that a PM? Sorry, really new to IRC
[09:47:35] <hdnine> eddie: It is a contact form yes and it might be that it includes jquery on its own?
[09:48:37] <eddiemonge> hdnine: thats what im thinking. it shouldnt. it should should check to see if jquery is already there and if not then include it. but it probably doesnt
[09:48:43] <danzik17> If I wanted to prepend an event handler on an element that already has event handlers bound, what would the best way be about doing that?  Right now I've got http://jsfiddle.net/H5UJa/ and want to see if there's any better ideas
[09:48:55] <hdnine> eddie: I deactivated it now and Tablesorter works again. http://www.tepg.se/browse/ Thanks for all your help! I will try to look in to what might be causing the problem... ^^

[09:53:01] <guy> when working with jquery css. do I need to explicitly name browser name for CSS3 properties like border-radius?
[09:53:08] <guy> css({'border-radius': 10})
[09:53:21] <guy> is enough, or do I need to write '-moz-border-radius': 10

[09:53:51] <boaz-> ugh
[09:55:00] <eddiemonge> boaz-: fail
[09:55:48] <hdnine> eddie: This is from Contact Form 7, might this be the problem? Sorry not that qualified yet so i don't recognize all the commands http://jsfiddle.net/hdnine/F8LtB/1/
[09:55:51] <guy> anyone?
[09:58:24] <Zzaichik> guy: you will need all attributes to be compatible with different browsers. Why not create a class name including all styles and then just add the classname using jQuery
[09:58:56] <eddiemonge> yeah its not checking to see what version of jquery if loaded and is trying to load it itself
[09:58:58] <guy> Zzaichik: because I am using this in animate() context.
[09:59:09] <Zzaichik> guy
[09:59:20] <guy> ?
[09:59:25] <Zzaichik> guy:  okay, then you hsould add them in the way you were thinking
[09:59:35] <bittyx-laptop> when you call out guy, he gets angry so he causes a net split
[10:00:02] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/PE8UV/4/ <--- okay, check this out - when you CLICK (3), that's what i want to happen (notice the difference between both CLICK (1) and CLICK (2), as well as the similarities). however, this solution is obviously not feasible, as i'd need to know all the widths and heights in advance. hope you understand what i mean now?
[10:00:09] <Zzaichik> haha I guess so.
[10:00:40] <Zzaichik> but to be compatible you'll want to add those different properties
[10:01:18] <bittyx-laptop> soo, does anyone know how to get CLICK (3) in http://jsfiddle.net/PE8UV/4/ without all the nasty workarounds, like the added container div, the overflow:hidden, as well as the absolutely defined heights?
[10:03:40] <eddiemonge> bittyx-laptop: how about something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/PE8UV/5/
[10:05:12] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: hmm, yeah, that could work as a work-around. but i was hoping for something simpler, without having to use an unnecessary extra div, and the css hacks
[10:05:17] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: thanks.
[10:08:25] <eddiemonge> or you do make div1 be absolute with the hidden one behind it, then animate the hidden div to slide down and after that make div1 not absolute but that is really dirty
[10:09:39] <jrockjiggz> or you can position the elements offscreen left: -9000px, and then use jquery to get the height of the el, then clone it and insert it after the dropdown
[10:10:40] <guy> how do I merge two objects into one without affecting the original object?
[10:10:40] <guy> $.extend(temp, {left: 0, '-webkit-border-radius': 10, '-moz-border-radius': 10, 'border-radius': 10});
[10:10:51] <guy> that is without affecting temp.
[10:10:59] <hdnine> eddie: Thanks a lot for the help! I commented out that function for now and it works =)
[10:11:04] <guy> I want the new object (merged to come out as a return value)
[10:13:16] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: that won't work, since, in a general case, the height of the hidden div can be (and for what i need it, always is) larger than the height of the clickable div

[10:43:46] <atriv> to the URL
[10:45:10] <eddiemonge> atriv: thats what i said to do. if you add a ? to the string with a new value it will make the browser not cache the result

[11:34:44] <Dr4g> Has anyone put HTML inside the lightbox area instead of just linking to an image ?
[11:35:13] <Aquaguy> is there any way to delay the execution of a piece of code? /* wait 2 seconds and then execute: */ parent.addClass('active');

[11:59:10] <Assimilater> hey i'm wondering how i can make this div 'fill' available vertical space. So on this image http://awesomescreenshot.com/07agwlw5b you can see a div with the label: notes. That div has height set with .height($(div to the left).height) i'm wanting to make the dark gray inside fill up the 'lighter gray' space. Any ideas?
[11:59:50] <imanc> does anyone know how I can reduce a list of checkboxes with the same 'name' to an array of values
[12:01:49] <kborchers> Assimilater: did you mean .height($(div to the left).height()). that is what it should be
[12:02:15] <Assimilater> did i make a typo?
[12:02:19] <Assimilater> oh ya missing the () lol
[12:03:00] <pilgrim> kborchers: So, is this the best way to test if a child has been selected: $myopts.children('option[selected="true"]').length > 0 ?
[12:03:37] <Assimilater> .position().top
[12:03:44] <Assimilater> maybe i could use that...
[12:03:47] * Assimilater tests
[12:03:55] <bseanvt> anyone have experience with advanced event delegation w/ jquery?
[12:04:11] <kborchers> pilgrim: no, do $myopts.children('option:selected').length and don't need > since 0 is false and >0 is true

[12:40:36] <Maltray> Hi guys, can i have a hand here?, im trying to make a contact form via AJAX with json, im having some problem with sending a json string with enters (on the message textarea), this is the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/5i1XegfZ
[12:41:04] <themiddleman_itv> Anyone know of a plugin that has text selection like iOS where you have a dragable handle on each end?
[12:41:19] <ProLoser|Mobile> tommyent: you can bind actions to whatever event you want
[12:41:28] <ProLoser|Mobile> look at .hover() or better yet just .bind()
[12:42:05] <themiddleman_itv> Maltray: that is valid json
[12:42:52] <themiddleman_itv> robh71: I don't understand, can you explain more of what youre trying to do?
[12:43:11] <Maltray> themiddleman_itv, then why is it throwing a json exception?
[12:43:18] <aggrav8d> kborchers - how should I send the array through json?
[12:44:19] <ProLoser|Mobile> koichirose: why did you make :Contains? i'm just curious
[12:44:34] <robh71> I have a new order form for a customer. The OLD order form is needed for some of their clients, but most will use the new order form. In the first page of the form, If I detect one of these customers that require the older form, I want to shove them to the old form, but with some post vars that are not on my new form.
[12:44:55] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, you mean why is it capitalized? i don't remember
[12:45:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> no i mean you declared it at the top
[12:45:09] <robh71> I do not want to make them refill out the other form though since they gave me the initial info I need on the new form.
[12:45:11] <themiddleman_itv> Maltray: are you sending it an object?  console.log the json youre trying to decode and the typeof it
[12:45:15] <ProLoser|Mobile> i think contains already eists in jquery
[12:45:32] <kborchers> aggrav8d: you'll need to serialize the array to something you can work with on the server side. you're doing an http request, whether its a GET or POST the data needs to be in a=1&b=2... format
[12:45:33] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, honestly I think I found that function somewhere
[12:45:36] <ProLoser|Mobile> also, you could do .bind('change keypu', function...
[12:45:45] <guy> guys, how would you go about finding center most element? http://anuary.com/svn/hp/pad/index.html play a bit with my version, and you'll see what's wrong.
[12:46:03] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, if you mean this then it's not the same: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[12:46:51] <Maltray> themiddleman_itv: http://pastebin.com/L5BTG52C
[12:47:13] <Maltray> (i placed the enters manually, as pastebin ignores em, but it appears with enters on the console)
[12:48:08] <themiddleman_itv> Maltray: ok, now paste it in http://jsonlint.com/
[12:48:48] <robh71> themiddleman_itv, basically I am trying to something tricky like window.location = "mysite.com" but with some post params
[12:49:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> koichirose: 1 min
[12:49:30] <Maltray> themiddleman_itv: should i put the enters there manually too right?, if i do that it throws: http://pastebin.com/PWsnYjhv, if i dont, it just validates it
[12:49:43] <themiddleman_itv> robh71: oh, then make a form with the target the new page and some stuff for data and submit it
[12:49:54] <imanc> hey guys if I do  $('input[type=checkbox]:checked'].each( function( index, obj ) {    console.debug( obj.val() );  });
[12:50:07] <imanc> obj has no attribute val()
[12:50:25] <imanc> trying to extract the checkbox's value="" field - any ideas?
[12:50:49] <robh71> themiddleman_itv, are you saying I should have the form hidden with some hidden vars and just submit that form using .submit()?
[12:51:19] <robh71> themiddleman_itv, and if it is that simple, can I do so without a submit button?
[12:51:26] <themiddleman_itv> robh71: its a weird way but yes, otherwise use get vars
[12:51:56] <nvictor> hey
[12:52:01] <robh71> themiddleman_itv, I'll give it a whirl and let you know. Thanks.
[12:52:02] <aggrav8d> kborchers - json encode?  tostring?
[12:52:14] <nvictor> how do i get the element inside a click handler?
[12:52:23] <aggrav8d> not sure what serialization method you suggest.
[12:52:40] <aggrav8d> nvictor - do you mean the element that is being clicked?
[12:52:48] <imanc> nvictor - $(this)
[12:53:05] <huzzah> I'm trying to grab text that is next to a node i.e. id like to grap "y" from "<b>x</b>y". Any clue how to do this?

[12:53:34] <aggrav8d> huzzah - siblings
[12:53:38] <ProLoser|Mobile> it's not working, i'm still working on it
[12:54:09] <imanc> anyone any ideas how I can access the value attribute, in this:     $('input').each( function(index, obj ) {     obj.val();    });
[12:54:10] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, thanks. Let me look at it.
[12:54:36] <nvictor> aggrav8d: i was using live("click"
[12:54:39] <ProLoser|Mobile> koichirose: i think however this is the direction you should be going
[12:54:45] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, it's not "value", but the actual text content
[12:54:58] <ProLoser|Mobile> you were doing stuff like var list = $('ul'); and then doing $(list) which is redundant
[12:55:18] <ProLoser|Mobile> doesn't matter, although i don't know why you have the values wrapped in ''
[12:55:28] <ProLoser|Mobile> since those are going to be escaped
[12:55:54] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, I don't remember the backend right now, but there was some reason :)
[12:56:05] <huzzah> aggrav8d: You might have to spell it out for me more. For something like "<span><b>x</b>y</span>", I've tried things like $('span > b').sibblings(), which seems only to give the same b node
[12:56:36] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, anyway, how do I filter the text and not the attributes?
[12:56:46] <grey-monkey> How do I specify a header in an ajax request? I tried adding header: "Accept: Application/json". http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:56:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> koichirose: it's easier to just use the attributes i think
[12:57:06] <ProLoser|Mobile> since it's the same kind of filter
[12:57:30] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, ok, because in this case I have text=value. But what if I didn't?
[12:59:21] <ProLoser|Mobile> what? why do you have text=value?
[12:59:49] <nvictor> remove() will remove an element from dom right?
[13:00:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> if that's what the api says
[13:01:57] <roger_padactor> having wierd size issues with table.  I have these templates. when Adding an image to the td with js for some reason the td width gets bigger not matter what even if the image width is set to be smaller.
[13:02:00] <robh71> themiddleman_itv, that did it, thanks.
[13:04:15] <mavv> hi! how to find element with TWO classes?
[13:04:54] <walkingeyerobot> hi! how to talk GOOD speak?
[13:05:09] <BillCriswell> mavv: You use the selector for two classes.
[13:05:48] <nvictor> is there a way to avoid typing parent() parent() parent() ?
[13:05:54] <nvictor> parent(3)?
[13:06:08] <BillCriswell> nvictor: closest('div.section') ?
[13:06:15] <mavv> walkingeyerobot: i still trying
[13:06:27] <nvictor> BillCriswell: hmm
[13:06:39] <ProLoser|Mobile> koichirose: i just realized you and i are both morons
[13:06:42] <nvictor> BillCriswell: but what if that div is enclosed?
[13:07:05] <nvictor> BillCriswell: woah, worked on first try :D
[13:07:09] <nvictor> BillCriswell: you da boss
[13:07:14] <BillCriswell> Haha, thanks.
[13:07:33] <BillCriswell> mavv: It would be like... div.message.error
[13:07:42] <ProLoser|Mobile> you have an input outside of an li
[13:08:00] <mavv> thank you
[13:08:07] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, ok?
[13:08:18] <ProLoser|Mobile> it breaks your dom
[13:08:25] <ProLoser|Mobile> and i've been filtering on the wrong level
[13:09:20] <koichirose> how does it break my dom?
[13:09:30] <koichirose> I don't want my dom broken.
[13:10:05] <koichirose> I see what you mean
[13:10:40] <ProLoser|Mobile> http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/TVD2f/2/
[13:10:45] <ProLoser|Mobile> closer but no cigar quite yet
[13:11:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> it only works the first time for some reason
[13:11:33] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, not even the first time here.
[13:11:44] <ProLoser|Mobile> it's case sensitive currently
[13:12:10] <nvictor> $(this) does not work with live("click", function(){ ...]) bindings
[13:12:43] <ProLoser|Mobile> nvictor: who are you telling that to? use delegate() if you must
[13:12:53] <nvictor> ProLoser|Mobile: ok
[13:13:23] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, right. then it works everytime, not just the first
[13:13:32] <ProLoser|Mobile> weird lol
[13:13:32] <nvictor> ProLoser|Mobile: wait i just need to get the element
[13:13:37] <nvictor> not delegate my handler
[13:13:56] <ProLoser|Mobile> koichirose: if you backspace and put in a new filter it works?
[13:14:13] <sphinxxx> anyone know how to have this slideshow stop on last slide: http://jsfiddle.net/csEm2/11/
[13:14:52] <ProLoser|Mobile> koichirose: merge my solution with your first one, throw the :Contains back in there and use it instead of [value*=
[13:15:04] <koichirose> ProLoser|Mobile, only in some cases. if you write 'sel' it shows Diesel. if you write 'SEL' it doesn't show DIESEL
[13:15:08] <ProLoser|Mobile> also, your broken dom is probably why the jsfiddle didn't work
[13:15:25] <nvictor> ProLoser|Mobile: any idea?

[13:28:14] <tallisman> btw, if you have a variable called isEmpty, can you create a one-liner to set it? (ie isEmpty = this.quantity || false; <-- but only returning true and not the actual quantity
[13:28:53] <_psychic_> can anyone help with my scope question? Why does 'this' change in a callback‚Äîand how do I work with that or change it?
[13:29:00] <kborchers[A]> tallisman: that should work just fine
[13:29:43] <skylamer`> GOOD NIGHT TO ALL Feellaz :)
[13:30:07] <kborchers> ?eval (4 || false)
[13:30:25] <tallisman> to work with 'this' from the parent scope you could put the 'this' in a 'that' variable outside of the callback.. thought that was the way _psychic_
[13:30:49] <tallisman> there might be better ways though..
[13:30:58] <kborchers> tallisman: no, that is the way
[13:31:01] <kborchers> you are right
[13:31:06] <tallisman> ah :p
[13:31:19] <_psychic_> Not sure I quite follow - inside of Widget.foo() I call something that has a callback of Widget.finishFoo() ‚Äî but I want "this" to be Widget not the event
[13:32:09] <_psychic_> tallisman: you're saying I need a pointer to Widget outside the callback/.
[13:32:10] <_psychic_> ?
[13:32:27] <kborchers> _psychic_: so inside Widget.foo() set var that = this; then inside Widget.finishFoo() you can reference "that"
[13:33:09] <tallisman> ?eval
[13:33:19] <tallisman> bot-t not here?
[13:33:24] * kborchers boo's bot-t
[13:33:31] * gnarf cries
[13:33:40] <gnarf> kborchers: "4"
[13:33:43] <_psychic_> kborchers: huh. I'll try it - thanks for the help /cc tallisman
[13:33:50] <gnarf> kborchers: || false makes no sense tho
[13:33:52] <gnarf> :)
[13:34:05] <gnarf> unless you want 0 || false to return "false"
[13:34:40] <tallisman> :p, I want to return a false or true based on the value is another variable :)
[13:34:47] <gnarf> _psychic_: see also http://api.jquery.com/proxy
[13:34:58] <gnarf> sory http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy
[13:35:11] <tallisman> if ( bla ) { return true; } else { return false }
[13:35:14] <kborchers> gnarf: doh, started as $(something).length || false ... how about var test = !!$(something).length; that would work right?
[13:35:16] <gnarf> $.proxy( Widget, "finishFoo" )
[13:35:28] <_psychic_> ah awesome
[13:35:47] <gnarf> returns a function that will call that function in the Widget context, always
[13:36:14] <gnarf> kborchers: do you really need true/false ONLY?
[13:36:20] <gnarf> because otherwise, !! is also wasted
[13:36:27] <gnarf> non-zero is truth, zero is false
[13:36:40] <kborchers> it wasn't for me, someone else. not sure the full situation
[13:36:52] <gnarf> roger
[13:37:07] <gnarf> i mean if you want to FORCE bool !! makes the most sense
[13:37:14] <kborchers> ok, thnx
[13:37:16] <gnarf> but really, no need
[13:37:34] <gnarf> unless later you are doing like if (somthing === false)
[13:37:49] <tallisman> so to force a bool you can do this: isEmpty = !!this.quantity || false; ?
[13:38:11] <tallisman> well it's just, I don't want isEmpty to hold a numeric value :p, ever
[13:39:13] <kborchers> tallisman: what gnarf was saying though is do you really need to store that isEmpty var? can't you just test this.quantity later since 0 will be false and >0 will be true?
[13:39:22] <imanc>  isEmpty = !this.Quantity ? true : false;
[13:39:48] <gnarf> tallisman: !!this.quantity will be true or false only
[13:39:59] <kborchers> tallisman: if you have to store it though just to isEmpty = !!this.quatity;
[13:40:00] <gnarf> hell
[13:40:09] <gnarf> isEmpty = !this.quantity
[13:40:15] <tallisman> okey ^^
[13:40:18] <gnarf> so why not instead of storing the var
[13:40:22] <gnarf> just if (!this.quantity)
[13:40:28] <gnarf> unless you're checking it more than like twice
[13:40:36] <gnarf> in which case, feel free to cache it
[13:40:45] <tallisman> I suppose you are right gnarf :p
[13:41:03] <tallisman> not all cosmetics look good.. looks at microsoft**
[13:42:17] <tallisman> ( their c# language has multiple structures containing an isEmpty variable.. while according to this conversation.. it's quite useless :p )
[13:43:50] <t3footie> I have a question about using jquery with wordpress. I have child pages in wordpress and my jquery selection isn't being applied to them. Any ideas?
[13:46:23] <phlp> it's a little more complicated in c# with the lack of type coercion. null != false
[13:49:58] <tallisman> oh
[13:51:49] <ksk239> $("div.contentToChange p:not(.alert)") - what does the p:not(.alert) part mean?
[13:52:53] <Assimilater> hey i have this code: http://pastie.org/2239099 and have verified with the console that the var "content" matches the correct div. However after logging 'html' i get an empty jquery object. This is what the post call returns: "<div class="Archive">07/19/2011 02:51 PM<div class="aContent">Testing</div></div>" Anyone here have any idea why 'html' would be empty?
[13:53:09] <phlp> ksk239: p that doesnt have the class alert
[13:53:30] <ksk239> what is a class?
[13:53:50] <phlp> css class.. class="alert" on the element
[13:54:03] <sphinxxx> is there a way to view console in jsfiddle?
[13:54:15] <ksk239> what is a css element?
[13:54:24] <Assimilater> sphinxxx: the same way you view console on any other page.....
[13:54:42] <phlp> am i being punkd?
[13:55:04] <madprops> why is this not scrolling? http://dpaste.com/571738/  I'm using this plugin https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel/blob/master/README.markdown
[13:55:26] <ksk239> punkd?
[13:56:03] <phlp> i meant html element <p class="alert">hi</p>
[13:57:50] <phlp> ksk239: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#class-html
[13:58:58] <chovy> is it possible to replace an element with a new element?
[13:59:23] <phlp> ? replaceWith @ chovy
[13:59:27] <chovy> ie: htmStr = '<h1>Foo</h1>'; $("h1").replace( htmStr );
[13:59:38] <kborchers> Assimilater: a few things
[13:59:38] <chovy> phlp: thanks
[14:00:34] <Assimilater> kborchers: watching intently, i am :)
[14:01:10] <kborchers> first, all of those parent calls is silly, try $(this).closest(".fNotes").find(".fContent"); which may actually have a better way to be written but it's a start
[14:01:42] <monk12> just curious, i was on youtube and wanted to test playing with jquery hide a div via the Firebug command line. guess they  don't use jquery or its not the standard $... anyway that brings me up to my question. is there a way to dynamically add jquery (preferably with my own 'namespace', aka using noConflict) to the page via Firebug?
[14:02:20] <monk12> i just want to see if i can do something like $('*').not('#watch-player').hide() haha.
[14:02:36] <monk12>  hide everything but video player hehe)
[14:03:28] <kborchers> second, i think you need to add your result to the dom before you can start hiding and modifying it. but i'm not totally sure on that one. this all assumes that your data is coming back. can you see that in firebug?
[14:04:25] <monk12> guess there are bookmarklets to do this. i'll check it out.
[14:04:38] <Assimilater> kborchers: i copied that response from firebug
[14:04:48] <madprops> why is this not scrolling? http://dpaste.com/571738/  I'm using this plugin https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel/blob/master/README.markdown
[14:06:31] <Assimilater> new code: http://pastie.org/2239099
[14:06:42] <Assimilater> (so you can see wehre i logged html)
[14:07:48] <Assimilater> now content is an empty jquery object
[14:09:20] <Assimilater> kborchers: if it helps here's what the html structure is like: http://pastie.org/2239342
[14:12:48] <jkoudys> Using $.animate, can I tell it to start at an offset, then animate back to the original position?
[14:12:48] <Rogi> which methods gets you width including margins?
[14:13:02] <sphinxxx> how do i refer to an instance of a plugin?
[14:13:19] <jkoudys> e.g. I know how to move something 50px to the right; I want to tell it to start 50px from the current offset, then slide back to 0
[14:13:28] <sphinxxx> so basically i called $('#somediv).myplugin { settings here};
[14:13:43] <sphinxxx> how do i access the instance of it? (basically what "this" is within the plugin)
[14:14:33] <phlp> Assimilater: $(this).closest('.cInsert').next('.fNotes').find('.fContent');
[14:15:07] <kborchers> phlp: thanks, i was working my way through that but kept getting lost
[14:15:46] <kborchers> Assimilater: you can also do this for the textarea var textarea = $(this).siblings('textarea');
[14:16:05] <Assimilater> phlp: oh so closest goes up the parents, as opposed to parent().parent().etc
[14:16:18] <phlp> yep
[14:16:41] <Assimilater> kborchers: ya i should probably familiarize myself with some more dom traversal functions....
[14:16:48] <Assimilater> in any case html is still empty
[14:17:22] <jbrokc> is there a way to register .click() for anchor elements that don't have an href ?
[14:21:20] <sadmicrowave> jbrokc, $('a').click(function(){ };
[14:21:35] <sphinxxx> are there any functions to strip letters out of a string, so to turn 500px into "500"
[14:21:42] <sadmicrowave> jbrokc, $('a').click(function(){ }); (typo)
[14:21:57] <phlp> "500px".replace('px','')
[14:22:16] <HerbieTheSteamin> Hey guys can anyone help me with the following jQuery issue - http://jsfiddle.net/fYYn4/ - the focus function will not work, however if focus() is replaced with val('example') it works, solution?
[14:22:40] <corgi> i need help w/ jquery event delegation
[14:22:49] <sadmicrowave> sphinxxx, do a parseInt( "100px" )
[14:23:42] <corgi> is it possible to listen for new elements added to a container via ajax?
[14:23:52] <corgi> every snippet/tutorial uses the live and click
[14:24:03] <corgi> but there is no click event
[14:24:07] <corgi> for what i want to accomplish
[14:24:46] <sadmicrowave> corgi, what are you wanting to do if the listener finds something new added?
[14:24:53] <coldhead> how does live not do what you want?
[14:26:09] <corgi> apply fancybox
[14:26:19] <sadmicrowave> coldhead, he thinks he needs to put .live() in his ajax success function
[14:28:18] <corgi> http://pastie.org/2239420
[14:28:48] <Merrick> does slideViewer 1.2 work in IE or Chrome?  I have the autoslide working in FF but in the other two browser it doesn't.  The click through works in all browsers though.  Any ideas?
[14:28:51] <corgi> if i'm returning a div with modal class in my response fancybox isn't aware of it
[14:28:58] <corgi> nothing happens when i click on it
[14:29:07] <sadmicrowave> corgi, you made a pastie for one line lol
[14:29:24] <corgi> yeah... just in case i need to add more
[14:29:39] <corgi> and it's technically 2 lines ;)
[14:30:05] <sadmicrowave> corgi, have you added the div with class='modal' to your body somewhere?
[14:31:32] <corgi> i just updated the pastie
[14:31:41] <corgi> http://pastie.org/2239420
[14:32:00] <adac> hi guys. I do get the slected value, whcih is an id in my case like that: "data: 'selected=' + this.value" but how do i get back the actual content and not the id (blurayplayer in this case) <option value="1">blurayplayer</option>
[14:32:25] <corgi> fancybox was a bad example because it can work when you click
[14:32:27] <corgi> on the link
[14:32:39] <sadmicrowave> corgi, paste your ajax success code
[14:33:08] <corgi> the ajax part works... it's put into the dom... i'm looking for the event delegation code
[14:33:18] <Segaja> hi, is it possible to modify the progressbar of jQUery UI so that it shows the current value as percent in the middle of the bar?
[14:34:32] <Assimilater> phlp: you think you can help me figure this one out since kborchers left? here's a screen if it helps: http://i436.photobucket.com/albums/qq89/Assimilater/Picture2.png
[14:34:48] <Assimilater> and the code in case you didn't catch it: http://pastie.org/2239099
[14:35:16] <phlp> adac: $(this).find(':selected').text()
[14:36:04] <corgi> sadmicrowave http://pastie.org/2239420
[14:36:09] <adac> phlp, oh thanks man! it worked!!
[14:36:14] <sadmicrowave> corgi, my point is that you should be putting the plugin initiators inside ajax success and after you append .modal to the DOM
[14:36:37] <corgi> i'm doing that and it seems really cluncky
[14:37:18] <sadmicrowave> gtg sorry
[14:39:23] <corgi> do you know coffeescript sadmicrowave... or should i paste the jquery code straight up?
[14:39:56] <phlp> Assimilater: the problem is you are putting the .Archive element in $() so it is the root. then you try to find .Archive (inside itself)
[14:40:08] <Xano> Is there a generic way to make jQuery plugins translatable?
[14:40:12] <Assimilater> so data is .Archive?
[14:40:16] <Assimilater> phlp: ^^
[14:40:19] <corgi> i wrap what i want to do in a function and then i call it when the page loads and then again w/ the after success ajax callback
[14:40:44] <djQuery> Xano: translatable?
[14:40:52] <corgi> does that look like a good strategy or a horrible approach?
[14:40:54] <corgi> it works
[14:40:54] <djQuery> the contents of the script or the output?
[14:40:55] <corgi> btw
[14:41:13] <Xano> djQuery: yeah, to translate stuff from one language to another
[14:41:22] <corgi> just not sure if it is a good approach or if there is a better more elegant way
[14:41:29] <djQuery> ?globalization
[14:41:33] <Xano> djQuery: Whatever strings the plugin displays on screen
[14:41:37] <Xano> ?internationalization
[14:41:50] <djQuery> take a look at the way that the ui.datepicker does it
[14:41:54] <ElCapitanMarklar> hey guys $(document).ready() fires before the pages elements have all loaded right?
[14:42:20] <djQuery> Xano: also there is this http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/06/10/jquery-globalization-plugin-from-microsoft.aspx
[14:42:37] <ElCapitanMarklar> ah crap i think ive just answered my own q
[14:43:11] <djQuery> ElCapitanMarklar: thanks for that it makes ansering u so much easier
[14:44:00] <Xano> djQuery: It doesn't look like that does translation
[14:45:02] <Assimilater> phlp: console.log(data) doesn't do anything...
[14:45:07] <djQuery> Xano: no it doesnt but besides translating it u need to do formating as well. ie dates\curencies\number formats
[14:45:12] <ElCapitanMarklar> no worries ;)
[14:45:34] <djQuery> Assimilater: see ?ftjq
[14:45:45] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[14:45:45] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 1 hour, 27 minutes and 30 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 252 seconds
[14:45:51] <djQuery> lazy bot
[14:46:20] <djQuery> Assimilater: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[14:46:32] <dr34mc0d3r> Im trying to change the position of a handle in UI Slider.  i have tried $('#slider').slider("option", "values", 1, 100);  to set the right hand handle on a slider - not working - what am i doing wrong?  I just want to change the position of a handle.
[14:46:53] <dr34mc0d3r> i dont think i have the correct syntax.
[14:47:06] <Xano> djQuery: Not in my case, or to be more precise, in the case of a developer I'm trying to help :)
[14:47:07] <djQuery> [1, 1000]
[14:47:20] <djQuery> dr34mc0d3r: ^^^^^^^^
[14:47:39] <magnet__> hello.
[14:48:23] <sphinxxx> if i have a bunch of img tags in a div, with jquery how can i efficiently count the number of img tags?
[14:48:25] <Assimilater> djQuery: thank you but no thank you, i'm already using fierbug
[14:48:39] <Assimilater> i'm saying console.log(data) didn't return anything in the console, it skipped over that line
[14:49:07] <magnet__> I try to use jquery's datepicker, it works when I use it on a input text field, but I wish it to be always visible.I found I need to use a <div>, but I can't get it to show.here is my code : http://dpaste.com/571750/ . can somebody help please ?
[14:49:07] <Assimilater> djQuery: have you happened to notice the thread i've been working on here for the last two hours?
[14:49:21] <djQuery> no just got here.
[14:49:33] <Assimilater> phlp: you still here?
[14:49:33] <martco> how do i add a callback to .show() without specifying an easing delay
[14:49:47] <djQuery> and just saying that console.log doesnt do anything is kinda missleading.
[14:49:47] <martco> ie foo.show(NULL, function() .... )
[14:49:57] <phlp> Assimilater: yes does firebug still show the reponse? the screenshot you had showed one which should be exactly what data is
[14:50:18] <Assimilater> phlp: the screenshot was showing console.log(html);
[14:50:26] <Assimilater> i changed it to console.log(data) and an entry was not made for it
[14:50:34] <martco> does it always have to have a delay
[14:50:40] <martco> how do i set no delay
[14:50:48] <phlp> yes but above the log it showed the response from the POST.. the html returned should be in data
[14:50:50] <Assimilater> interesting since my last question console.log($(data)) shows "jQuery(div.Archive)"
[14:51:01] <martco> i want to set no delay to show () AND define a callback
[14:51:07] <martco> how do i do that
[14:51:12] <Assimilater> i'm not sure the difference between data and $(data)
[14:51:29] <Assimilater> if data was a regular dom object i would expect a log of it to show such, but it didnt' show anything....
[14:51:47] <Assimilater> maybe it's just because it wasn't on the actual page....
[14:52:27] <phlp> what do you mean by anything? no response from the call at all? or a blank line or what
[14:52:54] <Assimilater> well no line at all
[14:53:01] <Assimilater> i swa the ajax call, then the content log
[14:53:07] <Assimilater> as if i didn't do console.log(data) at all
[14:53:45] <madprops> how can I make a div to go just below an input button that has no top fixed?
[14:54:31] <Assimilater> yay! this works :) http://pastie.org/2239563
[14:54:36] <Assimilater> thanks phlp
[14:54:45] <Assimilater> and i'd thank what's his name if he were still here :P
[14:54:50] <Assimilater> kbor something
[14:58:53] <magnet__> so nobody got an idea for my problem ? I'm looking for hours.
[15:00:39] <friskd> How in jQuery can I do send a post request with this data: Accept: application/vnd.steveklabnik-v2+json
[15:00:39] <djQuery> Assimilater: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/bRL9v/
[15:02:20] <phlp> magnet__: no $(document).ready ?
[15:02:55] <magnet__> phlp: no I don't have one.
[15:03:34] <djQuery> friskd: $.ajax({accepts: 'application/vnd.steveklabnik-v2+json', type: 'post' })
[15:03:44] <magnet__> phlp: do I need one ? I used this example http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#inline ( among others ).
[15:04:02] <gnarf> friskd: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[15:04:15] <gnarf> you can .setRequestHeader() on the jqXHR
[15:04:17] <friskd> djQuery: i am trying that. And am var_dumping the output on the server side.. But i don't see vnd.steveklabnik-v2+json info coming in.
[15:04:22] <phlp> magnet__: $(function() { ... }); is the same thing. are you using it?
[15:04:27] <gnarf> i think
[15:04:46] <gnarf> setRequestHeader(name, value) which departs from the standard by replacing the old value with the new one rather than concatenating the new value to the old one
[15:05:16] <magnet__> phlp: yes.
[15:05:29] <gnarf> so $.ajax({ beforeSend: function (jqXHR) { jqXHR.setRequestHeader("Accepts", "application/vnd.steveklabnik-v2+json"); });
[15:05:52] <gnarf> friskd: ^^^
[15:06:07] <friskd> gnarf: so why doesn't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/VNXuC/1/
[15:06:22] <friskd> testing yours now
[15:06:48] <gnarf> i dont know
[15:06:55] <djQuery> friskd: is this asp.net?
[15:07:04] <friskd> no php
[15:07:26] <gnarf> here
[15:07:31] <gnarf> accepts is a map
[15:07:32] <gnarf> not a string
[15:07:36] <gnarf> thats why
[15:07:47] <acidjazz> ur moms asp.net
[15:07:52] <gnarf> so accepts: { json: "application/...." }
[15:07:53] <gnarf> would work
[15:07:55] <gnarf> as an option
[15:08:00] <acidjazz> ur moms an option
[15:08:40] <gnarf> seems you can also pass headers: { Accepts: "...." }
[15:08:42] <gnarf> to .ajax()
[15:09:10] <gnarf> but accepts[ dataType ]
[15:09:12] <gnarf> is what gets used
[15:09:16] <gnarf> for the accepts header
[15:09:45] <gnarf> friskd: note the defaults: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L320-326
[15:09:59] <gnarf> and here is the code that sets it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L682-688
[15:10:53] <friskd> reading
[15:11:49] <gnarf> so $.ajax({ dataType: "json", accepts: {json: "application/...." } }); should work
[15:12:34] <friskd> ok let me try that
[15:13:15] <gnarf> yeah - it works: http://cl.ly/3M0o2b2R3P0g1b033p47
[15:13:47] <friskd> pefect! That worked gnarf!
[15:13:48] <friskd> tnx
[15:14:58] <magnet__> phlp: do you have any other ideas ? I'm pretty desperate atm.
[15:16:27] <phlp> magnet__: nope it should work http://jsfiddle.net/Hrggf
[15:17:54] <magnet__> phlp: I found something !
[15:18:31] <magnet__> phlp: jsfiddle code works with 1.6.2, but my version is 1.2.6 .
[15:18:54] <magnet__> phlp: on jsfiddle it does no seems to works with 1.2.6.
[15:19:23] <phlp> latest ui is jquery 1.3.2+
[15:25:26] <magnet__> phlp: I don't understand well.on this jsfiddle.net, ther is jquery 1.6.2 with jquery-ui 1.8.14 . the code doesn't show the calendar with jquery less than 1.4.4 with jquery-ui 1.8.7 .
[15:27:53] <phlp> magnet__: it's because when you select a different jquery the 1.8.7 ui is removed. if you add it as a resource it works http://jsfiddle.net/Hrggf/4
[15:29:01] <magnet__> phlp: oh allright, thanks for the information.

[15:51:36] <Avorin> Hi, is there a generic way to determine if an element has lost focus, but only to an element that is not its child?
[15:51:52] <awesome_guest> hi, I bind a function to a click event
[15:52:15] <awesome_guest> elem.click(function() {...})
[15:52:26] <awesome_guest> is there any way to pass optional arguments to that function?
[15:52:40] <awesome_guest> elem2.click("arg1", arg2)
[15:54:08] <jY> you call a function in the click function
[15:54:13] <jY> pass arguments that way
[15:54:27] <Avorin> awesome_guest: .click( [eventData,] handler(eventObject) )
[15:54:32] <jY> or use bind
[15:54:34] <Avorin> white eventData is an array of arguments
[15:54:46] <Avorin> click is only a "proxy" to bind

[17:05:19] <JoshuaYoshua> Hi
[17:06:58] <cakehero> anyone know of a plugin that lets you make a slider w/points on it
[17:07:59] <JoshuaYoshua> I was wondering how to use .load (http://api.jquery.com/load/) to load all content with the "body" tag but not include the "body" tag itself. Actually not sure how this works because there seems to be no description of the optional data parameter in the api. Any help would be great!
[17:08:14] <JoshuaYoshua> Oh I meant within the "body" tag
[17:09:43] <JoshuaYoshua> Okay I read and found what I wanted to know now! not to worry.
[17:10:30] <JoshuaYoshua> Bye
[17:11:02] <ngharo> care to share your solution?
[17:11:13] <JoshuaYoshua> Me?
[17:11:34] <ngharo> yes
[17:11:47] <ngharo> for the peanut gallery
[17:12:09] <coldhead> mmm peanuts
[17:12:52] <JoshuaYoshua> It says in the API (http://api.jquery.com/load/) under the "Loading Page Fragments" section. "The¬†.load()¬†method, unlike¬†$.get(), allows us to specify a portion of the remote document to be inserted. This is achieved with a special syntax for the¬†url¬†parameter. If one or more space characters are included in the string, the portion of the string following the first space is assumed to be a jQuery selector that deter
[17:13:19] <coldhead> so which selector did you use?
[17:15:06] <JoshuaYoshua> I have not looked into that yet.
[17:20:13] <JoshuaYoshua> coldhead, I'm still pretty new but "body *" might even work. Looking through http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ I'm sure I can come up with something!
[17:20:59] <coldhead> "body > *" is better
[17:21:18] <coldhead> but you will lose textnodes
[17:21:24] <JoshuaYoshua> There you have it, there is even a Descendant Selector.
[17:21:40] <coldhead> <body>this will <p>lol</p> be gone</body>
[17:23:20] <lenswipe> hey guys
[17:25:23] <bittyx-laptop> can anyone help with a weird problem where animate doesn't seem to work? i'm animating height, and logging both .css('height') and .height() to the console, and the log shows that they are changing correctly, but the DOM doesn't show the change in the style="" attribute of the element i'm animating, and also - it doesn't animate visually at all - it stays in the starting position until the end, when it "skips" to the new (target) height
[17:25:32] <bittyx-laptop> http://jsfiddle.net/PE8UV/8/ <--- when you click on "CLICK (3)", that's when the problem is seen
[17:35:29] <ryanneufeld> bittyx-laptop: what's the slideup supposed to di?
[17:35:48] <coldhead> how to do comments: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/442537/
[17:36:45] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: both functions are supposed to be generalized versions of CLICK (3) on this page: http://jsfiddle.net/PE8UV/4/
[17:37:13] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: ie. create a wrapper automatically, set all the css stuff, and animate it to the correct height (instead of a preset height)
[17:37:28] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[17:37:51] <ryanneufeld> why are you doing this instead of using the built in?
[17:38:21] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: because CLICK (1) and CLICK (2) are the built-in versions, and you can see the differences between those two and CLICK (3) on the last link
[17:38:26] <bittyx-laptop> (last link i gave you)
[17:38:32] <ryanneufeld> yes, I can see that
[17:38:34] <dnyy> what are the pros & cons of doing the first example instead of the second? https://gist.github.com/4a3d925dc24107272f0d Seems like you can have 'private' functions in the first, but not the second. I see a lot more people using the later, though, but I'm not sure why.
[17:38:46] <ryanneufeld> What I'm asking, is why you're re-inventing a plugin?
[17:38:48] <JoshuaYoshua> coldhead, why does it strip text nodes when I add a selector? it does so even with "body". I will have to look into that.
[17:38:49] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: well i haven't found the built-in version that does what i want
[17:39:02] <ryanneufeld> oic
[17:39:10] <ryanneufeld> What is it that you want?
[17:39:13] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: i've been asking for hours about this, no one suggested anything (and i couldn't find a suitable plugin by googling)
[17:39:54] <ryanneufeld> Okay, so what I'm seeing is that you have your own custom function, that is doing the same thing as blind
[17:39:54] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: i want functions that are easy to apply (like .slideDown() or .show('slide')), but the animation looks like CLICK (3)
[17:39:58] <ryanneufeld> unles I'm missing something
[17:40:02] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: ah, but it's not the same
[17:40:11] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: see, CLICK (2) is 'blind'
[17:40:28] <ryanneufeld> AH
[17:40:29] <ryanneufeld> I see
[17:40:44] <bittyx-laptop> and CLICK (1) is 'slide'
[17:40:46] <ryanneufeld> you like that the third one keeps the top the same
[17:41:00] <ryanneufeld> but the second it seems to slide behind the above?
[17:41:05] <ryanneufeld> is that what you're driving at?
[17:41:48] <bittyx-laptop> now i want the 'slide' animation (ie. the div shows up like a drawer from the top), but without jumping the content down immediately - i want the content below to smoothly slide down (like it does with 'blind')
[17:41:50] <ryanneufeld> Also, I hope you're not using #id[data-role] as a selector in production
[17:41:54] <ryanneufeld> cause that's just sloppy
[17:42:12] <ryanneufeld> use .click and add/remove class
[17:42:45] <bittyx-laptop> what? why?
[17:42:52] <ryanneufeld> cause it's way slow
[17:42:58] <ryanneufeld> like WAAAAYYY slow
[17:43:08] <bittyx-laptop> oh. didn't know that. thanks for the info, i'll look into it.
[17:43:17] <bittyx-laptop> but that still doesn't solve my original problem :P
[17:43:42] <bittyx-laptop> i mean, in http://jsfiddle.net/PE8UV/8/ <--- can you confirm with the console that the height is being animated?
[17:43:53] <bittyx-laptop> and can you also confirm that the animation isn't actually visible on the page?
[17:44:37] <sphinxxx> can anyone tell me why here www.nautiandco.com, in the sliderviewpro js file, the line
[17:44:37] <sphinxxx> var imgCount= jQuery('li.iyi').length -1;
[17:44:37] <sphinxxx>   it keeps returned ‚àí1 in the console
[17:45:16] <ryanneufeld> bittyx-laptop: I only changed one http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/PE8UV/11/
[17:46:46] <sphinxxx> anyone?
[17:47:01] <JoshuaYoshua> Looks like I will have to use .get and use .contents()
[17:48:19] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: i see, thanks. but that's not my problem right now... :P
[17:48:20] <JoshuaYoshua> sphinxx jQuery('li.iyi').length must equal 0 then...
[17:48:24] <ryanneufeld> no
[17:48:33] <ryanneufeld> bittyx-laptop: it's not, you're right
[17:48:43] <JoshuaYoshua> I mean sphinxxx
[17:51:15] <sphinxxx> JoshuaYoshua:  ya but it should be returning like 4
[17:51:19] <mecode> i have a search box #search which will, when typed in, automatically have the results appear. i'm going to attach to the 'keyUp' event (isn't that best?). the thing that bothers me is how if you type something then the requests are updated several times. it should wait a small amount of time before sending/updating so that every keyUp doesn't cause another ajax request. ideas?
[17:51:52] <bittyx-laptop> sphinxxx: when i open up the firebug console and do console.log(jQuery('li.iyi').length), i get "3"
[17:52:04] <bittyx-laptop> which seems correct from scanning the source...
[17:52:10] <kborchers> ?autocomplete @ mecode
[17:52:10] <bot-t> mecode, jQuery UI - Autocomplete Demos & Documentation - The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. Here the suggestions are tags for programming languages, give "ja" (for Java or JavaScript) a try. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[17:52:54] <mecode> kborchers: it's really not an autocomplete, and it's not only with jquery, i can't use the jquery ui to implement this
[17:53:45] <kborchers> mecode: but if you look at the autocomplete source, you might see how to handle your delay
[17:53:47] <sphinxxx> bittyx-laptop:  im getting that too, so why the heck is it logging -1
[17:53:51] <JoshuaYoshua> sphinxx I would make sure that jQuery('li.iyi') is correct.
[17:54:14] <JoshuaYoshua> Sorry, I mean sphinxxx
[17:54:25] <bittyx-laptop> sphinxxx: because it isn't being called on document load or ready, but perhaps before the page is fully loaded?
[17:54:48] <bittyx-laptop> so jQuery('li.iy').length is still 0, and when you substract 1, you get -1
[17:54:50] <ryanneufeld> bittyx-laptop: I think your problem is how you're getting the hidden elements height
[17:54:57] <kborchers> mecode: see http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote it has a delay before fetching the data if you quickly type "robin"
[17:55:38] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: no it's not - if you check the console while clicking CLICK (3), you can see the height updating correctly (this is done via the "step" option in .animate(), i just console.log the height of the wrapper)
[17:55:42] <bittyx-laptop> that's the weird part
[17:55:48] <bittyx-laptop> it seems to be correctly updating
[17:55:49] <lenswipe> can someone help me out with CKEditor?
[17:56:00] <bittyx-laptop> but there's no visual change until the end
[17:56:18] <ryanneufeld> bittyx-laptop: hmmm... what's wrong with just using height again?
[17:56:20] <kborchers> mecode: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L325
[17:56:36] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: i'm not sure i understand?
[17:57:13] <ryanneufeld> bittyx-laptop: I still don't think I full understand the problem. You can animate the height just fine, and you have several built in animations
[17:57:15] <bittyx-laptop> sphinxxx: just try stuffing the whole sliderviewpro in a document ready
[17:57:25] <kborchers> mecode: u see there, you use a combination of setTimeout and checking if the value changed before requesting your data via ajax
[17:58:02] <mecode> kborchers: alright that looks about right. i'll read through that code and see if i can get something working. thanks
[17:58:18] <sphinxxx> bittyx-laptop:  its in window(load)

[17:58:50] <bittyx-laptop> e original html markup
[17:59:16] <ryanneufeld> bittyx-laptop: oic
[17:59:47] <bittyx-laptop> sphinxxx: where? i don't see it
[18:00:24] <sphinxxx> bittyx-laptop:  if you look in the sliderviewpro.js file, i set the imgCount variable
[18:00:36] <bittyx-laptop> sphinxxx: actually, while my console is open, and when i hit F5, i can clearly see that the imgCount is logged *before* the page is rendered
[18:00:47] <sphinxxx> ya i was just gonna say that
[18:01:07] <sphinxxx> i have to define it in the sliderviewpro.js file though right?
[18:01:15] <sphinxxx> otherwise the plugin won't be able to reference it?
[18:01:41] <bittyx-laptop> sphinxxx: i think you can define it wherever you want
[18:02:03] <sphinxxx> so in doc ready is ok?
[18:02:16] <bittyx-laptop> sphinxxx: not just okay, but that's exactly where it *should* be
[18:02:38] <coldhead> the most okay of all
[18:04:09] <bittyx-laptop> coldhead: hey, i remember you're a jquery guru, mind helping me out if you have a minute or two?
[18:04:24] <coldhead> it's only my first day using jquery but sure, let me try
[18:04:48] <bittyx-laptop> seriously? hmm, i distinctly seem to recall talking to you before (like, a few months ago) in this channel
[18:05:17] <coldhead> wasn't cloudhead?
[18:05:21] <coldhead> he has a similar name
[18:05:48] <bittyx-laptop> hmm, maybe you're right, i'm not sure
[18:05:54] <coldhead> me either
[18:06:02] <coldhead> what's your problem anyway?
[18:06:26] <bittyx-laptop> okay - http://jsfiddle.net/PE8UV/4/ <--- CLICK (1) uses the built-in 'slide' effect, CLICK (2) uses the 'blind' effect, and CLICK (3) does exactly what i want (which is kind of a mix between the first two)
[18:07:01] <bittyx-laptop> now, i want to make a general function that does that, creating a wrapper div dynamically, animating its height, and removing it
[18:07:10] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: am now
[18:07:22] <bittyx-laptop> http://jsfiddle.net/PE8UV/8/ <--- this is an attempt at it, but it has some problem which i can't figure out at all
[18:07:25] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: well, now you're too late :p
[18:07:28] <ryanneufeld> I figured it out lol
[18:07:44] <bittyx-laptop> basically, at every step of the animation, i'm logging the wrapper div's height
[18:07:54] <bittyx-laptop> and if you have the console open, you can see the height changing correctly
[18:08:16] <bittyx-laptop> however, on the actual page, the height doesn't change until the end of the animation, where it just skips to the full height
[18:08:24] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: sorry, i wanted to be your superhero
[18:08:26] <bittyx-laptop> (on the actual page = in the result area)
[18:08:37] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you still are
[18:08:45] <bittyx-laptop> i've been trying to figure it out for hours, but no luck :/
[18:10:53] <sphinxxx> bittyx-laptop:  if i define imgCount ins doc ready, the plugin doesn't recognize it
[18:10:57] <sphinxxx> sigh
[18:14:39] <coldhead> bittyx-laptop: it sure looks like a display:block problem
[18:14:47] <coldhead> as in something doesn't have it when it should
[18:14:52] <coldhead> but i'm not sure what
[18:15:20] <bittyx-laptop> coldhead: i've tried setting the display: block in the wrapper's css but it hasn't helped
[18:15:49] <bittyx-laptop> meh, i'm going to sleep, it's 3am here, i can't look at my screen anymore
[18:15:52] <ryanneufeld> hmmm
[18:15:54] <bittyx-laptop> thanks for taking a look at least
[18:15:59] <ryanneufeld> there is something else going on...
[18:16:07] <bittyx-laptop> ryanneufeld: yes?
[18:16:19] <bittyx-laptop> if you are talking about my code...
[18:16:36] <ryanneufeld> yes
[18:16:37] <coldhead> i bet he is
[18:16:37] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/qC4g4/
[18:16:42] <ryanneufeld> how's that looking?
[18:17:01] <bittyx-laptop> nah, but that's just the 'blind' effect
[18:17:10] <ryanneufeld> okay
[18:17:17] <ryanneufeld> what the fuck are you trying to do then?
[18:17:20] <bittyx-laptop> the "ShowMe" doesn't actually slide down from behind the "ClickMe" in your example
[18:17:28] <ryanneufeld> oic
[18:17:47] <bittyx-laptop> well i've told you - http://jsfiddle.com/PE8UV/4/ <-- exactly what CLICK(3) does
[18:17:49] <coldhead> you have to animate the margins for that shit
[18:18:17] <bittyx-laptop> coldhead: i think that's how show('slide') works, but that just creates a nasty jump for all the content below
[18:18:43] <bittyx-laptop> coldhead: show('blind') moves the content below smoothly, but doesn't slide out from the item above it
[18:18:48] <bittyx-laptop> it's more like it gets revealed
[18:19:10] <bittyx-laptop> now, i want it to slide down AND move all the other content smoothly
[18:19:42] <coldhead> i would try animating the top and bottom margins
[18:19:42] <bittyx-laptop> which is what CLICK(3) does in the fiddle i've just linked, but i also want to do it dynamically - ie. not have any extra markup in the original html
[18:19:55] <coldhead> yes
[18:20:01] <coldhead> i think you want something quite hard
[18:20:09] <coldhead> if i were you i'd solve it in my sleep
[18:20:18] <bittyx-laptop> but i was hoping it shouldn't be. yeah, that's what i'm hoping for.
[18:20:25] <bittyx-laptop> thanks for helping all, i've really gotta go now
[18:20:26] <bittyx-laptop> g'night
[18:20:42] <coldhead> sweet bugfree dreams. bittyx-laptop
[18:20:52] <lenswipe> hey guys

[18:44:54] <Parserror> If I have this code http://pastie.org/2240378 how could I access a hash element that is contained within?
[18:45:34] <jjb123> Is there a way to select a class that starts with something and has a specific id? For example, can I do "#someid [class^=someclass_]"?
[18:48:28] <Parserror> jjb123: I think you can
[18:48:41] <Parserror> jjb123: just without the space, I think
[18:49:51] <jjb123> Parseerror: Yeah I figured it out, you use [selector1][selector2]. With your thing, what do you mean you want to access the hash element? What not just do "data.hash_element_I_want_to_access" like you have in the code?
[18:51:12] <lenswipe> can someone help me out with CKEditor?
[18:51:25] <Parserror> jjb123: I believe that the data being returned is a string so if I just put data then I see the hash
[18:51:54] <Parserror> jjb123: I'm just not sure how to tell JS that what it's getting back is a hash and that I want to access an element from it
[18:53:43] <jjb123> Parseerror: data["hash_element_I_want_to_access"] ?
[18:55:30] <Parserror> jjb123: that would work in ruby. I'll give it a shot in JS lol dunno though
[18:55:52] <gtotha> Hello jQuery ninjas. Does anyone have any idea why my animations aren't working well in ie8 ? ( www.velawebdev.com )
[18:55:59] <lenswipe> can someone help me out with CKEditor?
[19:04:48] <rhizmoe> hidey ho
[19:11:26] <gtotha> rhizmoe: hey! Can you figure out why my code wont work in ie8 here: www.velawebdev.com ?

[19:29:24] <imsky> i get it
[19:29:28] <imsky> everyone's on vacation
[19:30:51] <gnarf> lenswipe: what issue you having with CKEditor?
[19:31:02] <gnarf> and i hope the question has something to do with jQuery + CKEditor
[19:31:03] <lenswipe> nvm i think i have it figured thanks :)
[19:31:07] <gnarf> coo
[19:31:08] <lenswipe> but yes it was
[19:31:17] <gnarf> \o/
[19:32:31] <Parserror> If I have a character array whose characters are the code for an array how can I convert?
[19:36:08] <coldhead> ?mdc apply @ Parserror

[19:39:31] <mikeric> is there a way to do a fadeIn/fadeOut type effect for changing the contents of an element?
[19:39:41] <mikeric> kind of like fadeTo, but for changing contents.
[19:40:12] <Parserror> mikeric: couldn't you just change the contents and then do the fade?
[19:40:25] <mikeric> for example, having <strong>103</strong> fade into <strong>104</strong>
[19:40:57] <mikeric> Parserror: i don't want to fade out the content, and then fade in the new contents.
[19:41:15] <Eightamrock> mikeric: you would have to position them on top of each other then you could fade one out and one in
[19:41:16] <mikeric> but rather have them coexist, while the old one fades out and the new content fades in.
[19:41:30] <mikeric> Eightamrock: k, that makes sense.
[19:41:47] <Eightamrock> I do this all the time with tabbed content div's
[19:42:01] <Guest57828> hello, i have a FF extension, and I need to detect when all XHR have completed in jQuery (for example, a webpage with "$(document).ready" containing several "$.ajax")... is there some property for that? thank you
[19:43:23] <Eightamrock> mikeric: if you do it, I recommend doing it with css3 transitions and backing it up with jquery
[19:44:07] <Eightamrock> you can set the classes of which to fade in/out with jquery but that animation you are going for is simple enough for css to handle
[19:52:09] <nostar> im using .live() to catch all links in a dynamically changing div, and it works, but id and class both come up blank when i try to get them with .attr()
[19:54:08] <Eightamrock> nostar: live catches events
[19:54:19] <Eightamrock> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[19:54:59] <Eightamrock> are you trying to select the anchors or listening for clicks?
[19:55:25] <nostar> Eightamrock i know.  what im saying is $(e.target).attr('class') that i catch from a click comes back with null class and id, even though they are in the tag
[19:56:13] <Eightamrock> I had this problem today actually with something similar, are you dynamically injecting these links with jquery?
[19:56:22] <nostar> yes
[19:56:33] <Eightamrock> are you using $(elm).html()
[19:56:50] <nostar> yes
[19:57:22] <Eightamrock> yep, I had the same problem after you dynamically change the links in the container you have to re initialize your event listener
[20:05:59] <nostar> i thought thats what .live() got me out of having to do.
[20:11:23] <Eightamrock> It does, but you have to instantiate it when the elements exist
[20:27:46] <Assimilater> ok so with this code: http://jsfiddle.net/e8Zvg/ I need to set the initial values of $(this).button('option', 'able') and $(this).attr('dir') without calling Load(), (otherwise i'd just throw a .click() at the end); anyone know how i can accomplish this?
[20:28:48] <Assimilater> in my attempts to manually put those default values on the button itself you would have to click twice because the first time you click it maintained the same value....
[20:30:32] <lenswipe> hey guys
[20:30:50] <lenswipe> i have a group of blocks and i want to find the tallest one and make all the others the same size, how do i do that?
[20:31:44] <Assimilater> lenswipe: stumbled across this when looking at doing something similar: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/equalize-heights-of-divs/
[20:31:53] <Assimilater> short answer: use .height()
[20:32:58] <Assimilater> lenswipe: also if you need to take border/padding into account look at .outerHeight()
[20:33:02] <lenswipe> Assimilater, what it is, i have 4 blocks at the bottom of my page for navigation and links and crap and one of them (navigatoin) will get larger as more pages are added and i would like the others to increase with it
[20:33:09] <lenswipe> thanks :_)
[20:35:36] <nostar> well i did a .die() and then a new .live() on the whole div after the .html() call, and just a simple alert($(e.target).attr('class')); as the callback but all attr's still come up null
[20:37:22] <Eightamrock> nostar, can you e.stopPropagation() after the link is click and console.log(e)
[20:37:56] <Eightamrock> see if what the event object has in it
[20:38:01] <Eightamrock> maybe that will give you some clues
[20:42:38] <Assimilater> ah...so toggle starts at some null then goes to the first toggle, so if i set for the second toggle instead of the first (in other words reorder the toggle functions) then it works....
[20:42:40] <Assimilater> pft
[20:43:16] <lenswipe> hmm
[20:43:38] <lenswipe> Assimilater, ,i couldnt get that working,  do you know of way to grab all the elements with particular class?
[20:46:57] <Assimilater> $('.myClass')
[20:47:08] <Assimilater> lenswipe: ^^
[20:47:09] <lenswipe> Assimilater, that will give me one class surely
[20:47:25] <Assimilater> that implements whatever actions on the right to all object that have that class
[20:47:27] <lenswipe> one element*
[20:47:31] <Assimilater> no
[20:47:32] <skiz> lenswipe: an enumerable with all dom elements with that class
[20:47:34] <Assimilater> it gives you all elements
[20:47:40] <lenswipe> Assimilater, im gonna try and get all the elements with a class name, find the largest and then make them all that size
[20:47:45] <lenswipe> can that be done using that method?
[20:48:57] <Assimilater> lenswipe: did you look at that link?
[20:49:07] <lenswipe> what link?
[20:49:10] <lenswipe> the one you sent first?
[20:49:14] <lenswipe> yes i did and i couldnt get it work
[20:49:14] <Assimilater> aye
[20:49:18] <Assimilater> replace div with .myClass
[20:50:29] <lenswipe> i did and it didnt work :/
[20:50:40] <Assimilater> you have a live url or paste?
[20:51:00] <lenswipe> sure hang on
[20:51:53] <lenswipe> Assimilater, it works now :D
[20:52:00] <Assimilater> lol, k
[20:55:48] <lenswipe> Assimilater, http://95.146.89.178/stpeters2
[20:55:57] <lenswipe> Assimilater, its not working on the bottom of there :(
[20:57:52] <sprezzatura> how do i access 'this' inside the $.get responsehandler function?
[20:58:27] <coldhead> save a reference to it when it has the value you want
[20:58:28] <coldhead> and use that
[20:59:00] <coldhead> var thing = this; etc(); etc(); $(thing).yay();
[20:59:12] <misterm> sprezzatura: you just use "this"
[20:59:26] <misterm> of course whether or not "this" is what you want, I don't know
[20:59:36] <misterm> and how to handle that depends on what you want it to be
[20:59:45] <sprezzatura> misterm: a sec. let me ping a code snippet.
[21:00:00] <sprezzatura> misterm: Neerav:

[21:00:02] <sprezzatura> oops
[21:00:10] <sprezzatura> thats want meant for it
[21:00:15] <sprezzatura> misterm: http://jsfiddle.net/rFbUk/
[21:01:09] <sprezzatura> misterm: you see the responseText check for '0', i want to remove the tr only then.
[21:01:26] <sprezzatura> as of now, the tr is removed irrespetive of whatever be the response, which is kind of cranky
[21:01:57] <misterm> sprezzatura: so you want "this" to be  $('.delete') ?
[21:02:42] <sprezzatura> misterm: i have rows(trs) which have a column(td) with a link with the class 'delete'  - clicking this should fire this event.
[21:03:00] <sprezzatura> it makes a ajax get call, and based on the response, i need to remove the nearest row(tr).
[21:03:18] <misterm> sprezzatura: I just need to know what you want "this" to be inside the callback
[21:03:57] <sprezzatura> 'this' should preserve the same value as when this was triggered.
[21:04:05] <sprezzatura> so that : $($(this).closest("tr")).fadeTo(400, 0, function () { $(this).remove();});  can be used.
[21:04:07] <misterm> sprezzatura: at any rate, you would either cache it in a variable, or apply the function to what you want
[21:04:23] <sprezzatura> misterm: but this is "INSIDE" a function.
[21:05:15] <misterm> sprezzatura: you can either do var *variablename* = $(this);
[21:05:19] <misterm> before you call get
[21:05:30] <misterm> and then inside get use *variablename* instead of this
[21:06:03] <misterm> or move the callback code to a function, and apply() or call() it on the object
[21:06:13] <sprezzatura> misterm: let me try quickly.
[21:07:31] <sprezzatura> misterm: neat. worked
[21:07:34] <sprezzatura> thanks
[21:08:25] <ryanhiebert_> Hey all, I was thinking about how many sites use jquery, and about the ways to speed up the process.  Since so many sites probably use the EXACT SAME version of jquery, having the browser download it over and over again seems rather rediculous.  A method of overcoming this is for sites to use a shared-host libary, such as the one hosted by google.  This has the problem of ADOPTION.  If nobody adopts it, it
[21:08:26] <ryanhiebert_> doesn't really help much. I had another thought, and that is to use a hash to identify duplicate content, in a similar vein to the way git stores it's data blobs using a sha1, which is virtually guaranteed to reference a unique blob of data.  Has anybody heard of any development on an approach like that?
[21:09:50] <misterm> ryanhiebert_: you mean have the browser request the hash of the file first and then only download the file if it doesn't have it already?
[21:09:59] <sprezzatura> misterm: is there a better construct that confirm box?
[21:10:08] <misterm> sprezzatura: not sure what you mean
[21:10:20] <ryanhiebert_> something like that, yeah.  perhaps the hash would get sent as metadata in the html tag or something.
[21:10:21] <sprezzatura> misterm: i mean, is there a jquery UI component which does something similar
[21:10:35] <misterm> sprezzatura: sure you could use jQuery UI
[21:10:56] <misterm> ryanhiebert_: what do you mean?
[21:11:25] <ryanhiebert_> probably the http head way makes more sense
[21:11:53] <ryanhiebert_> the html idea was <link href=... sha1=...>
[21:12:29] <misterm> hm
[21:14:54] <ryanhiebert_> it would only be useful in shared lib contexts, but if the browser recognized it, it could share libraries with sites that did NOTHING to help the process.
[21:15:14] <ryanhiebert_> For instance, my stupid brother writes a site, uses jquery, but doesn't put the hash.
[21:15:26] <misterm> ryanhiebert_: I don't know much about the current state of HTTP in browsers/SPDY etc
[21:15:38] <misterm> so I dunno if there's similar works in progress
[21:15:44] <Zackko> help please! haha
[21:16:01] <misterm> it's an interesting idea though, it might work
[21:16:01] <ryanhiebert_> I however, use the hash, and when my visitor visits his site first then mine, it can already tell that it already has the data, no need to redownload.
[21:16:09] <misterm> it depends on the overhead
[21:16:26] <misterm> as it is now if you serve your files properly, the lib would be downloaded once at most
[21:17:05] <misterm> and for things like jQuery a CDN is probably good enough
[21:17:20] <misterm> but yea, if you could get it into a browser with low enough overhead it couldn't hurt
[21:18:08] <ryanhiebert_> any thoughts on where I could go to look for people that may have already had this idea?
[21:18:16] <Zackko> ok im not amazing at javascript, so im running into scope issues. heres my small chunk of code: http://jsbin.com/ovemok/2/edit
[21:18:41] <misterm> ryanhiebert_: I'd check the dev communities for the various browsers/web servers?
[21:19:06] <ryanhiebert_> sounds like a good place to start.  thanks misterm
[21:19:24] <misterm> np, wish I could be more helpful
[21:19:38] <Zackko> im trying to attach a separate click event to each row of the table. there needs to be a relevant user_id passed to each "loadForm" event but it just attaches the same user_id to all of the rows
[21:19:41] <misterm> Zackko: this is a classic newbie issue
[21:20:03] <Zackko> yea i would really like to learn how to do this right, ive ran into it a handful oftimes
[21:20:37] <misterm> if you google "javascript closure for loop" you should find about a million explanations of the issue
[21:21:02] <Zackko> ok will do
[21:21:06] <misterm> but basically the issue is, the value of i is not bound at the time you assign the click handler
[21:21:34] <misterm> when the click handler runs, it will look up the current value of i
[21:21:47] <Zackko> thats what i figured
[21:21:49] <misterm> which will be whatever i was when the function that the for loop is in finished
[21:23:54] <Zackko> ahh i see the closure thing now in something i found on google
[21:23:57] <Zackko> ima try it out lol
[21:28:30] <Zackko> it worked! Thank you so much. thats so freakin confusing lol
[21:29:09] <lenswipe> im off, goodnight
[21:29:31] <misterm> Zackko: its something a lot of people get stuck on
[21:29:47] <Zackko> good to know lol. makes me feel normal
[21:48:07] <b-owl> show('slide', {direction:'right'}, 2500) and other variations of that are really jumpy
[21:48:18] <b-owl> how can i remove that jumpyness ?
[22:01:31] <FiSHNUGGET> can someone explain to me why a $.get request would not get fired on a window.unload?
[22:02:45] <coldhead> maybe unloading a window kills ajax
[22:02:55] <coldhead> it would make sense
[22:03:04] <FiSHNUGGET> hmm...  bollocks
[22:03:13] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: it could be a lot of things
[22:03:13] <FiSHNUGGET> anyone know of a workaround>
[22:03:39] <FiSHNUGGET> it executes everything up to the get
[22:03:52] <coldhead> it probably starts on the get(), too
[22:03:57] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: does the get request work in other contexts?
[22:04:00] <coldhead> and then it doesn't have time to gomblete
[22:04:00] <FiSHNUGGET> yes
[22:04:09] <FiSHNUGGET> works on click
[22:04:11] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: is the request synch or asynch?
[22:04:30] <misterm> My guess is if it's an asynch request it fires, but then the page is unloaded before the response
[22:04:44] <coldhead> no that was my guess
[22:04:48] <coldhead> you stole my guess!
[22:04:55] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: is the request showing up in your dev tools?
[22:05:05] <misterm> coldhead: great minds think alike :-p
[22:05:26] <FiSHNUGGET> not showing up in dev tools
[22:05:31] <misterm> of course that's not saying much because crappy minds think alike too
[22:05:34] <FiSHNUGGET> it does when I do it on lick
[22:05:36] <FiSHNUGGET> *click
[22:05:47] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: what about in your server logs?
[22:06:01] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: what browsers are you trying it in?
[22:06:02] <FiSHNUGGET> I think misterm nailed it
[22:06:15] <FiSHNUGGET> with the response thing
[22:06:22] <misterm> lol, and coldhead
[22:06:27] <FiSHNUGGET> and coldhead
[22:06:45] <coldhead> NO YOU KEEP THE GLORY, MISTERM
[22:06:47] <coldhead> I DON'T NEED IT
[22:06:51] <coldhead> I GOT THESE PILLS
[22:06:51] <misterm> it's either that or AJAX is just straight up disabled
[22:06:54] <coldhead> I'LL BE FIIINE
[22:07:01] <misterm> I know window.open is disabled in unload in some contexts
[22:07:31] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: what happens if you make the request synchronous?
[22:08:11] <misterm> I don't think that's really a great idea, but I wonder if it works
[22:08:28] <FiSHNUGGET> what I checking now
[22:08:35] <FiSHNUGGET> insert "am"
[22:10:11] <misterm> probably the proper thing to do is to just warn the user on beforeunload that they might lose data, or whatever you are doing with the request
[22:10:50] <b-owl> has anyone had issues with jquery's animations being jumpy? specifically show/hide when you specify a direction?
[22:11:36] <FiSHNUGGET> I love you guys
[22:11:55] <FiSHNUGGET> namely misterm and coldhead
[22:11:57] <misterm> I love you too
[22:12:02] <misterm> Im just not IN love with you
[22:12:31] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: so what happened?
[22:12:56] <FiSHNUGGET> setting async to false did the trick
[22:13:09] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: yea, I don't know if that's really a good idea though
[22:13:14] <FiSHNUGGET> no?
[22:13:41] <misterm> doing a blocking operation in unload doesn't feel right imho
[22:13:54] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: what is the request doing?
[22:14:33] <FiSHNUGGET> sending some data to and MVC controller method
[22:14:39] <FiSHNUGGET> and = an
[22:15:00] <FiSHNUGGET> data for a current play time of an embedded movie player
[22:15:19] <FiSHNUGGET> too much info?
[22:17:08] <misterm> hm, well it's hard to say without knowing all the app and everything...but I would try to avoid blocking unload like that
[22:17:26] <coldhead> i don't think you can
[22:17:30] <misterm> but if you're stuck and you can do it, I guess it works
[22:17:32] <FiSHNUGGET> kind of confused...  blocking as in...  would prevent the page from unloading?
[22:17:38] <coldhead> you can't have the request in the absence of the window
[22:18:29] <FiSHNUGGET> ye...  it makes sense...  if the action depends on the response, and a response of ready iks never received, the request would technically never take place right?
[22:18:36] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: in theory a synchronous request will block everything until it completes
[22:18:49] <misterm> tbh, I'm not sure how that works in the context of unload
[22:18:49] <FiSHNUGGET> hmm...  maybe set a timeout on it?
[22:18:57] <coldhead> if a tree falls in the woods
[22:19:05] <coldhead> if a drunk falls in a urinal
[22:19:07] <FiSHNUGGET> like...  a while loop that counts the seconds?
[22:19:13] <drd> FiSHNUGGET: http://api.jquery.com/unload/ first comment
[22:19:18] <FiSHNUGGET> just in case it does have some issues
[22:19:24] <misterm> Im sure modern browsers have something in place to handle blocking unload
[22:19:37] <coldhead> yeah Force Quit
[22:19:38] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: well settimeout wouldn't be synchronous
[22:19:46] <FiSHNUGGET> drd - ye, that's exactly what I did
[22:20:00] <FiSHNUGGET> also true
[22:20:44] <drd> does a shared worker die if no pages from your site are open?
[22:20:45] <FiSHNUGGET> hmm...  gonna let it ride for now I think
[22:21:18] <Cork> i don't think you need to care about that
[22:21:38] <Cork> sure it will block the page, but you already have a network connection timeout
[22:21:53] <Cork> so why add another one?
[22:22:24] <FiSHNUGGET> just to handle it on the site.
[22:22:49] <FiSHNUGGET> unless we could set an apache timeout to handle it
[22:23:00] <FiSHNUGGET> jsut to redirect in the event of a hangup
[22:23:01] <Cork> FiSHNUGGET: i meant the browser already handels it
[22:23:18] <FiSHNUGGET> but only by displaying a white diag screen right?
[22:23:47] <Cork> it drops the network connection when the connection timeout reaches
[22:24:12] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: for what purpose are you saving the time?
[22:24:20] <misterm> is it something you could just store locally?
[22:24:21] <Cork> the client has a connection timeout and the server has a script run time
[22:24:49] <FiSHNUGGET> jots a log of the current "Play Postion" - when the user loads that same video again, it checks and restarts origin @ that positon
[22:25:20] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: why not store that locally?
[22:25:42] <FiSHNUGGET> locally, as in session?
[22:25:45] <FiSHNUGGET> or cookie?
[22:25:57] <misterm> as in some form of client side storage
[22:26:11] <misterm> like local storage, cookies, flash cookies, gears, etc
[22:26:40] <drd> that's assuming they're in the same browser
[22:26:49] <drd> (though it was my first thought as well)
[22:26:56] <FiSHNUGGET> right...  is there some sort of persistent clioent side storage?
[22:27:29] <misterm> drd: true, but it would mainly be a fallback
[22:27:40] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: yea, there's a few
[22:27:56] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: you would most likely be using a library that just wraps them for you
[22:28:03] <FiSHNUGGET> still...  what if the connect from a mobile device?
[22:28:06] <FiSHNUGGET> *they
[22:28:20] <misterm> there are local storage options on mobile devices
[22:28:23] <drd> $.cookie() is one option
[22:28:28] <drd> & simple
[22:28:39] <FiSHNUGGET> I mean...  it wouldn't have the saved positon from last viewing on a different device
[22:29:05] <misterm> FiSHNUGGET: no, but it could be combined with a server-side storage
[22:29:24] <misterm> I think between the two you could avoid having to save the exact time serverside
[22:29:27] <FiSHNUGGET> which still leads me to need to make some sort of record server side
[22:30:00] <misterm> yea, but you could probably be more lax with it
[22:30:25] <FiSHNUGGET> hmm...  possibly.
[22:30:36] <FiSHNUGGET> that's one to ponder
[22:31:16] <misterm> at the very least, you could just make the request on unload and not block
[22:31:35] <misterm> well actually, hm..I dunno if you could do that
[22:32:00] <misterm> but yea...there's lot's of ways you could go
[22:36:04] <FiSHNUGGET> nonetheless, that totally works for now, and I have got lots more to do.  Thanks for the help!
[22:54:24] <djQuery> anyone used ui.menubar yet? how to put selections in the menubar? ie view| small, medium, large
[22:56:13] <Billy> hello shaunt
[22:56:31] <Shaunt> you know my name.....
[23:07:08] <Cork> dj_goku: i don't think it supports that yet
[23:08:05] <Cork> *djQuery
[23:10:35] <djQuery> just leaving them as standard <li> and adding a toggleclass('ui-state-active') on them
[23:10:58] * Cork nods
[23:11:08] <Cork> you can prob add an icon if you like
[23:11:11] <Cork> and toggle that
[23:11:30] <Cork> that far is at least supported
[23:12:15] <djQuery> was just using 1 li for all the items and adding a <div><input type="checkbox"> etc.... but it didnt wrap correctly
[23:12:51] <djQuery> Cork: putting .buttonset on the div
[23:14:10] <Cork> djQuery: no i meant it has support for icons nativly
[23:14:51] <djQuery> Cork: I see ui-icon-check but where is its corresponding unchecked?
[23:14:56] <Cork> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/menu/menu.html
[23:15:09] <Cork> (third example)
[23:15:16] <djQuery> I see it
[23:17:28] <djQuery> it doesnt neccessarily support if from looking at the source they are just adding spans into the <a>
[23:33:30] <coldhead> Thanks you great work!!!
