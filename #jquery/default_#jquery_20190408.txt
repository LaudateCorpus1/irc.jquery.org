[05:27:26] <thebigj> Is there any way to identify that the Ajax request is failed by browser for CORS reasons?
[05:32:27] <thebigj> I want to distinguish requests failing for no response with requests failied by browser for no "Allowed-origin*" headers in response
[05:35:23] <thebigj> "Access-*-Allow-Origin"
[05:57:58] <pavonia> AFAIK there isn't
[06:59:02] <cardi> hi everyone, i have a basic question for web dev, i like to dev a website that manager desktop / mobile, which libraries i have to include ?
[07:09:04] <cardi> okay, i'm okay with jquery's differents libraries, but what's the best way to detect desktop / mobile device ?
[07:23:37] <undefined_bob> cardi: what's your desired purpose? Having different sizes and stuff like that for the content? Then you can just use the @media queries in CSS
[07:25:24] <cardi> i would find the best way to detect desktop or mobile, and then apply different contents
[07:33:56] <undefined_bob> cardi: maybe this link can help you. it shows a bunch of different approaches: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3514784/what-is-the-best-way-to-detect-a-mobile-device-in-jquery  But for me it sounds like you can do it with CSS
