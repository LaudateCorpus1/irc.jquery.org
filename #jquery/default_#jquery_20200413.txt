[16:59:12] <nitrospectide> I am using this short script to apply a class to DOM items in order to have them CSS-animate when they are scrolled into the viewport. But when multiple items are on the same row, and come into the viewport at the same time, I'd rather their animations be staggered for a better look. What's the best way to achieve that? https://hastebin.com/fowuqiqula.js
