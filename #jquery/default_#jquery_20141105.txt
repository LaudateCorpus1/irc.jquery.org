[00:28:39] <scc> Just checking best practises. I've got a delete button on a table, originally specified as a <a href>, which on clicking deletes that row from the internals on the back end. Should it really be a small form with a submit button?
[00:28:55] <scc> by really, I mean instead.
[00:36:27] <frox> hey, can somone help me please with fotorama?
[00:40:51] <tuskkk___> hello, I have a form, where, as the user types anything on the input field, an error message displayed below (div) should get hidden. the class below that input is a label, so how do I select it?
[00:44:14] <Cork> tuskkk___: $(this).nextAll('.the-class-name').first().hide()
[00:51:37] <tuskkk___> Cork: when I cosole logged $(this).nextAll('.errorMessage').first().hide();, its shows an empty [ ]
[00:51:40] <tuskkk___> :(
[00:51:57] <Cork> tuskkk___: then .errorMessage isn't a sibling
[00:52:02] <Cork> so it doesn't come "after"
[00:52:10] <tuskkk___> here is the html, IT IS
[00:52:13] <tuskkk___> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/WfMHkZgC
[00:52:26] <Cork> please use jsfiddle
[00:52:33] <tuskkk___> see, the next to next div after input
[00:52:36] <tuskkk___> Ok, one sex
[00:52:40] <tuskkk___> second*
[00:52:59] <tuskkk___> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/62hgnkt4/
[00:53:41] <Cork> tuskkk___: you missed the starting tag for the div wrapping the input
[00:53:51] <Cork> and no they arn't siblings
[00:53:59] <Cork> you have div > input
[00:54:06] <tuskkk___> Cork: yea just copied hastily
[00:54:08] <Cork> and the div has a sibling with div > div
[00:54:20] <Cork> so you would first have to traverse up to the wrapping div
[00:54:24] <Cork> so you have siblings
[00:54:34] <tuskkk___> umm, sorry what?
[00:54:37] <Cork> (and i can't give you the selector to use as the element is missing)
[00:55:09] <tuskkk___> Cork: see now, http://jsfiddle.net/62hgnkt4/1/
[00:58:01] <Cork> tuskkk___: $(this).closest('.login-input-box').nextAll('.login-labe').first('.errorMessage')
[01:08:05] <tuskkk___> Cork: that made it behave strangely, unfortunately there are 2 divs of login-labe before this form :(
[01:08:27] <Cork> tuskkk___: shouldn't matter
[01:08:38] <tuskkk___> also, it did as per hide the error after something was typed, it has completely stopped showing the errors
[01:08:49] <Cork> .closest() goes up until if finds the closest parent that matches
[01:08:56] <tuskkk___> oh yeah right
[01:09:11] <tuskkk___> but its not behaving as it should :(
[01:10:24] <Cork> tuskkk___:
[01:10:24] <Cork> * teamcoltra (~textual@S0106bcee7b356cb0.vc.shawcable.net) has joined
[01:10:26] <Cork> opps
[01:10:46] <Cork> man i hate that irc clients sometimes copy on select -_-'
[01:10:51] <Cork> tuskkk___: http://jsfiddle.net/62hgnkt4/2/
[01:11:15] <Cork> tuskkk___: first name does what you describe
[01:11:49] <tuskkk___> Cork: yea, now when the user beings to type, error message should go
[01:14:21] <Cork> tuskkk___: and so it does
[01:20:15] <tuskkk___> Cork: yes, but now if the value is removed and resubmitted, the error doesnt come back, also it doesn "hide" as per say on keypress, value just gets removed, take a look at the js I wrote, http://jsfiddle.net/nhw8n2qk/1/
[01:21:32] <rohit__> Greetings!
[01:22:13] <rohit__> I am trying to change the UI, and send some synchronous ajax requests from .click event handler.
[01:22:51] <rohit__> Even though the code to change the UI is ABOVE the code which sends ajax requests, Ajax requests happen first.
[01:23:20] <rohit__> And then executes the code to change the UI.
[01:23:37] <rohit__> Been trying to solve this since last two days.
[01:24:37] <Cork> rohit__: don't ever ever EVER use synchronus ajax
[01:25:16] <Cork> the browser has to jump through a lot of faking to try to make it look like it works
[01:25:44] <rohit__> Cork, why is that? If it's not the right way, why would they support it?
[01:25:45] <Cork> and you can't modify what is visible on the page until the response comes back or the connection times out
[01:25:58] <Cork> rohit__: aync ajax is never the right way
[01:26:03] <Cork> *sync
[01:26:39] <Cork> rohit__: change the code to use async ajax instead
[01:26:48] <Cork> and the problem will most likely go away
[01:27:17] <rohit__> I tried async before
[01:27:35] <rohit__> And yes, this problem doesn't exist with ajax requests being async.
[01:28:44] <rohit__> Anyway, I will try to resolve 'the other' problem, if fail to do so, I'll ask as new question.
[01:28:45] <Cork> rohit__: the browser has to restart the event again after the response comes back
[01:29:01] <Cork> rohit__: and this is known to cause all kind of weird code bugs
[01:29:20] <rohit__> Cork, When the request is sync, right?
[01:29:27] <Cork> yes
[01:29:31] <rohit__> Ok, thanks.
[01:29:40] <Cork> same with alert/confirm/prompt
[01:29:45] <rohit__> Will try to resolve the other problem with async requests.
[01:29:59] <Cork> everything that "stops" the js code will case weird code flow
[01:30:16] <Cork> rohit__: also sync ajax is a legacy interface
[01:30:22] <Cork> it isn't maintained
[01:30:32] <Cork> just kept for backwards compatibility with old sites
[01:30:50] <rohit__> I see. thanks.
[01:31:46] <Cork> also note that async: false is marked deprecated in jquery
[01:32:27] <rohit__> ok, will read it once again.
[01:32:30] <rohit__> brb
[01:34:06] <krambiorix> hi, how can i make this work? http://jsfiddle.net/0qrbygm9/

[01:44:29] <carlton> i hate the name of this scripting language
[01:44:39] <carlton> java, javascript
[01:44:42] <carlton> why
[01:45:03] <Cork> carlton: simple it tried to penetrate the market when java was the big hype
[01:45:22] <carlton> java is a terrible name though
[01:45:30] <carlton> they should change it
[01:45:32] <Cork> so it took the name java for scripting to get attention
[01:45:37] <Cork> carlton: it has changed
[01:45:42] <Cork> quite a while ago
[01:45:45] <carlton> ?
[01:45:47] <Cork> the correct name is ecmascript
[01:45:58] <carlton> yeah, that's somewhat sexy
[01:45:58] <Cork> many don't refer to it as that though
[01:46:03] <Cork> cause javascript is better known
[01:46:08] <carlton> i will begin referring to it that way from now on
[01:46:16] <carlton> emcascript sucks balls
[01:46:20] <Cork> http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/
[01:46:30] <carlton> ecma*
[01:47:11] <Cork> don't care
[01:47:29] <Cork> (meaning it doesn't bother me)
[01:47:50] <carlton> it's like, just by the name, which language would you prefer to use C++ or Java
[01:47:57] <carlton> i'd think Java is some kind of stupid joke
[01:48:00] <Cork> c++ every time
[01:48:14] <Cork> well it has its usage
[01:48:20] <Cork> but ya, it is way overused now days
[01:48:30] <carlton> i picture a spanish guy with a fedora
[01:49:11] <carlton> anyways, back to work
[02:55:29] <Bear10> I have an iframe located on a different top domain than my site and I want to modify css classes and other things on it, I get a complaing about cross domains but I'm not quite sure how to fix it. I've tried adding "*" to .htaccess but no luck
[02:55:33] <Bear10> Is there anything else I can do?
[03:13:56] <Cork> Bear10: no you can't
[03:14:22] <Cork> Bear10: you could have an api to the third party server so you could push messages from your site to there site
[03:14:25] <Cork> to do the modifications
[03:14:38] <Cork> but it demands inter op from both sides
[03:18:52] <fat>  Is it possible to make this more efficient http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2469/ It's a table sort jquery script
[03:20:11] <Cork> yes, by not using sortElement
[03:20:30] <Cork> it moves the elements in dom
[03:20:36] <Cork> resulting in reflows for each element
[03:20:53] <fat> what do you recommend instead?
[03:20:58] <Cork> structure them in a fragment and then insert the result
[03:22:09] <Cork> something like var rows = Array.prototype.sort.call($('selector'), func); table.html(rows);
[03:24:13] <fat> Can you please put it in a simple example? can I just integrate it with http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2469/ instead of sortElements(function(a, b)
[03:30:16] <Cork> fat: what columns do you want to sort on?
[03:30:23] <fat> any
[03:30:26] <fat> just as an example
[03:30:30] <Cork> any=
[03:31:04] <fat> "City" column
[03:31:31] <Cork> that ones already sorted though :)
[03:31:40] <Cork> but ok, ill give you something
[03:32:02] <fat> ok\
[03:32:23] <Cork> ah now i see what you did
[03:32:36] <fat> ye
[03:33:18] <Jacta> Cork, do you know bootstrapvalidation?
[03:33:26] <Cork> no
[03:39:29] <Cork> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2470/
[03:40:49] <fat> Cork: Is this a more efficient method?
[03:41:55] <Cork> fat: it should result in less dom mutations
[03:42:04] <Cork> but for the size of table you have it might not matter
[03:42:51] <fat> Cork: thanks so much
[03:42:54] <Cork> np
[03:46:55] <fat> Cork: I want 3 tables on my page, but only two of them should have the ability to be sorted, ie, the first and second. Is it possible to do this, without copy-pasting all the javascript for the 2nd table?
[03:46:56] <fat> http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2474/
[03:47:20] <Cork> fat: your doing an each loop around the even binding
[03:47:36] <Cork> use a delegated even handler for a common parent
[03:47:45] <Cork> and instead use something like classes on the headrs
[03:47:59] <Cork> then get the index from $(this).index()
[03:48:04] <Cork> and you should able to
[03:50:59] <fat> Cork: can you please put it in a simple example please?
[03:51:11] <Cork> fat: i can't code the entire project for you
[03:53:00] <fat> Cork: i';ll try myself
[03:55:45] <Xatenev> Almighty cork codes everybodies projects.
[03:56:03] <mooncup> 12:51 < Cork> fat: i can't code the entire project for you
[03:56:07] <mooncup> lies and slander
[03:56:27] <Xatenev> :d
[03:57:10] <sacho_> Cork, why not?
[03:59:53] <Cork> sacho_: i think my boss would be quite bad if i did
[04:00:03] <Cork> *quite mad
[04:00:46] <sacho_> how rude of him
[04:00:50] <Cork> lol
[04:01:04] <mooncup> idk how you get time to write your own code with the amount of time you spend fixing other people's
[04:01:34] <Cork> i don't spend that much time fixing ppls code
[04:01:41] <Cork> i mainly tell them how to
[04:01:42] <Uhkis> have you ever noticed how fast he fixes other peoples code?
[04:01:54] <mooncup> tru.dat
[04:01:56] <Uhkis> at work Cork just facerolls the keyboard and projects are done
[04:02:02] <mooncup> are you a frontend dev then Cork?
[04:02:10] <Cork> mooncup: nope
[04:02:25] <mooncup> oh
[04:02:33] <mooncup> web dev of some type though I'm guessing?
[04:02:49] <Cork> i handle the full stack
[04:03:01] <Cork> and that isn't just web
[04:03:44] <Uhkis> from kernel to browser? :)
[04:03:50] <Cork> heh nop
[04:04:08] <Cork> from provisioning automation to backend server to front end
[04:04:36] <mooncup> ah fun times
[04:04:46] <Cork> it keeps you on your toes :)
[04:04:58] <mooncup> yeah
[04:05:08] <mooncup> officially my job is backend dev
[04:05:18] <mooncup> but in reality I'm a full stack dev and sysadmin lol
[04:05:23] <Cork> lately i spend much more time then i would like banging on rails though
[04:05:52] <Uhkis> sounds dangerous
[04:06:03] <Cork> i start to hit lots of bugs in there framework :/
[04:07:49] <blez> what's the jquery's .on() equiavalent in raw javascript?
[04:08:04] <Cork> .addEventListener(
[04:08:17] <Cork> but it doesn't have the delegate feature
[04:08:57] <blez> what's the delegate feature?
[04:09:51] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com on
[04:09:52] <b-ot> Cork: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:10:04] <sacho_> docs is good, read plz
[04:10:06] <Cork> or read more about it on
[04:10:09] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com delegate
[04:10:10] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:12:13] <blez> so .on() is like .live()? it works on every newly created element that matches the selector?
[04:12:15] <blez> is that delegation?
[04:12:24] <Cork> no
[04:12:46] <Cork> there is nothing in jquery that is like live anymore
[04:12:55] <blez> why?
[04:13:05] <Cork> .on is a combination function that depending on arguments work like .bind or .delegate
[04:13:08] <sacho_> blez, live was bad and should feel bad
[04:13:27] <blez> what's wrong about it? It attached handler to every newly created element
[04:13:28] <Cork> .live had a call structure that was inefficient and confusing
[04:13:35] <Cork> blez: no it didn't
[04:13:43] <sacho_> blez, .live() attaches to document
[04:13:44] <Cork> that is one of the confusions it created
[04:14:25] <Cork> $('select').live('event', func) is the same as $(document).on('event', 'select', func)
[04:14:31] <sacho_> blez, barring the odd usage syntax...what he said
[04:14:40] <Cork> only difference is that the later is actually understandable what it does
[04:15:03] <Cork> and before .on existed it was
[04:15:15] <Cork> $('select').live('event', func) is the same as $(document).delegate('select', 'event', func)
[04:16:46] <blez> I don't understand delegation, where can I find good example of it?
[04:17:00] <sacho_> blez, have you used .live()?
[04:17:10] <blez> yes
[04:17:24] <sacho_> every usage of .live() is delegation
[04:17:31] <sacho_> do you know about event bubbling?
[04:18:00] <blez> yep
[04:18:45] <sacho_> okay, the idea is fairly simple - you use delegation to 1) limit the number of handlers you attach, or 2) be prepared to handle non-existant elements
[04:18:53] <blez> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8110934/direct-vs-delegated-jquery-on it seems that's a good explaination
[04:19:18] <sacho_> sure
[04:21:00] <blez> so if I have a div with 5 list elements, .on() (direct) will work on them only, not for newer elements; if I have delegated .on() it will work on every newly created element inside it?
[04:21:35] <Cork> blez: no with delegate you target a parent
[04:21:48] <Cork> and says it to filter events to only match the selector given
[04:22:31] <Cork> blez: ex $('li').live('click', func) is best converted to $('ul').on('click', 'li', func)
[04:22:45] <Cork> or an id or something
[04:23:06] <sacho_> blez, if you have a div with 5 elements, and do $(div).bind('click'), this will trigger whenever anything within the div is clicked
[04:23:27] <sacho_> (as long as the event wasn't stopped from propagating)
[04:23:53] <sacho_> blez, $(div).bind('click', handler) is equivalent to $(div).on('click', handler)
[04:24:22] <sacho_> blez, but let's say you have a bunch of buttons and a bunch of other stuff in the div - you don't want to handle clicks on the "other stuff", just the buttons
[04:24:54] <sacho_> blez, then you could do something like $(div).bind('click', function (event) { // check if event.target is a button, then do stuff })
[04:25:08] <sacho_> blez, this is what delegation does in a nutshell
[04:25:08] <fat> Cork: if i give them unique IDs, table one and two only get sorted, which is good, but when i sort one column in table 1, it sorts table 2 as well http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2477/
[04:25:19] <blez> why not $(div).on("click", "button", handler) ?
[04:25:30] <sacho_> blez, that was my point
[04:25:35] <blez> aha
[04:25:42] <blez> some sort of filtering?
[04:25:45] <sacho_> yes
[04:25:54] <sacho_> it'll filter event.target based on the selector "button"
[04:26:05] <blez> I get it.
[04:26:32] <Cork> fat: you don't need an id
[04:26:48] <Cork> when the header is clicked use $(this).closest('table') to find the target table
[04:26:59] <Cork> and use that as a base for all your selection/sorting
[04:28:17] <fat> Cork: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2479/
[04:28:37] <Cork> fat: don't do the .each on line 5
[04:28:50] <Jacta> Can anyone help me solve the error I get here - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26755537/script-error-when-using-identical-feature-in-bootstrapvalidator - bootstrapvalidation and identical - working example is included
[04:29:07] <fat> Cork: instead of .each, what should i use?
[04:29:14] <Cork> fat: give the table a .sortable and same on the header
[04:29:15] <fat> flter?
[04:29:18] <Cork> no
[04:29:21] <Cork> nothing
[04:29:23] <fat> ok
[04:29:49] <Cork> $('table.sortable').on('click', 'thead td.sortable', )
[04:29:53] <Cork> use that instead
[04:31:53] <eugenmayer> hello. Are there any know clipboard plugins available? (handling onpaste ond maybe even drag&drop
[04:32:18] <Cork> eugenmayer: why would you need a plugin for that?
[04:32:36] <caraconan> Hi there. There's an easy option to show a loading message each time that an ajax request is being performed? Looking at http://api.jquerymobile.com/loader bu no dice. I'm able to manually start/stop the loading, but just 1 time
[04:32:36] <Cork> $('selector').on('paste', func)
[04:32:39] <eugenmayer> Cork: x-browser - this one is not trivial, even to the ClipboardAPI
[04:32:41] <caraconan> Any example will be appreciated
[04:32:57] <eugenmayer> Cork: yeah, that would be awesome. But maybe in a different worls.
[04:33:04] <eugenmayer> s/worls/world
[04:33:07] <Cork> eugenmayer: uh, sorry?
[04:33:14] <caraconan> If its possible to show a spin in the middle of the page without additional messages each time than an ajax request is being done I'm happy with that
[04:33:31] <Cork> caraconan: use the ajaxSetup
[04:33:31] <fat> Cork: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2483/
[04:33:42] <eugenmayer> Cork: it is not working x-browser. Safari issues, IE11 issues, FF30+ issues. At least combining with binary data like images
[04:33:47] <xinming> Hi, Anyone here knows how do we check wether a dom is in jquery?
[04:33:50] <xinming> Oops
[04:33:52] <xinming> sorry
[04:34:00] <xinming> Hi, Anyone here knows how do we check wether a dom is in the document?
[04:34:28] <caraconan> Cork: a little example will be appreciated. Thanks
[04:34:54] <Cork> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2484/
[04:34:59] <sacho_> ?
[04:35:02] <xinming> for example, I have a dom removed via $('#id').remove();    and I have a reference to $('#id') before the remove. So, I saw dom is still referenced.
[04:35:17] <xinming> so, How do we check wether the node is in the document?
[04:35:37] <eugenmayer> Cork: special handling webkit and so forth..
[04:37:04] <Cork> xinming: .remove doesn't kill references
[04:37:14] <Cork> that would be a memory exploit waiting to happen
[04:37:29] <Cork> xinming: the gc only removes the element when nothing references it anymore
[04:37:32] <sacho_> xinming, check if it has a parent node
[04:37:42] <sacho_> xinming, e.g. $().parent() == null
[04:37:54] <Cork> xinming: so the problem isn't that the element is in the dom anymore
[04:38:01] <sacho_> hmm
[04:38:03] <Cork> it is that it is kept alive by the reference
[04:38:20] <sacho_> $().parent().get(0) rather
[04:38:27] <caraconan> Cork: it does not automatically hides each time the ajax request is done?
[04:38:27] <Cork> sacho_: that isn't the problem
[04:38:40] <Cork> caraconan: you have to do that your self
[04:38:46] <fat> Cork: it doesn't work
[04:38:53] <Cork> from the always or complete callback
[04:39:00] <Cork> fat: i only fixed the errors at the top
[04:39:06] <Cork> you have to understand the code
[04:39:19] <caraconan> Cork: ok, thanks
[04:40:43] <fat> ok
[04:57:52] <juslintek> can someone help me this jquery to prenet from jumping to highest yrow: http://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/mphdpdf1/17/
[05:09:15] <BrazenBraden> when using $.load(url, data, callback), how would I specify in the data that it is a json request?
[05:09:46] <Cork> you don't use $.load for json
[05:09:59] <Cork> you use $.ajax, $.get or $.json
[05:10:01] <Cork> uh
[05:10:06] <Cork> $.getJSON :)
[05:10:23] <BrazenBraden> hmm
[05:11:31] <BrazenBraden> its weird.. ive been using $.load() since the begining of the project (rails) and never had a problem. but today I am trying to remove the dependancy on a rails gem and now when I try load a path I get a  'Failed to load resource: net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE'
[05:11:52] <BrazenBraden> i am just assuming that it is due to my controller looking for html and json requests and what it is receiving is neither
[05:12:02] <Cork> BrazenBraden: $().load is for loading html into a dom element
[05:12:04] <Cork> nothing else
[05:12:19] <BrazenBraden> and it does a GET on the path correct?.
[05:12:22] <fat> Cork: what should I do http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2490/
[05:12:24] <Cork> yes
[05:12:33] <BrazenBraden> right, so logically, all should be peachy!
[05:12:34] <fat> i added <ttbodY.
[05:12:37] <fat> <tbody>
[05:13:00] <Cork> uh
[05:13:00] <jeffreylevesque_> I'm trying to use `draggable`()`
[05:13:10] <Cork> you've reverted most of the changes...
[05:13:52] <Cork> BrazenBraden: if you want to load an html resource sure it works well
[05:14:15] <BrazenBraden> thats all im doing really.. click button and ajax load in the html view requested
[05:15:04] <caraconan> Cork: do you see something in the code: http://paste.debian.net/130380/ I'm not able to show the second loader (line 64). The first one is working perfectly. Thanks
[05:15:39] <Cork> BrazenBraden: "how would I specify in the data that it is a json request?" <-- your question doesn't reflect that at all
[05:16:17] <BrazenBraden> well, im assuming it has some form of request type header being sent along and my controller is looking for requests of type html and json
[05:16:32] <Technodrome> is it possible to apply a css rule on an element which has a transform on it , after the transform has completed?
[05:16:46] <Cork> BrazenBraden: that is the accept header
[05:16:54] <Cork> or the .json/html extension
[05:17:25] <Cork> ?mdn transisionEnd
[05:17:26] <b-ot> Cork: Sorry, no results for ‟developer.mozilla.org transisionEnd”.
[05:17:36] <Cork> O_o
[05:17:54] <Cork> case sensitive?
[05:17:57] <Cork> ?mdn transisionend
[05:17:59] <b-ot> Cork: Sorry, no results for ‟developer.mozilla.org transisionend”.
[05:18:09] <Cork> Technodrome: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/transitionend
[05:18:38] <Cork> Technodrome: i assumed you meant transision and not transform
[05:18:53] <Technodrome> i meant transform i think
[05:18:57] <Technodrome> the element is moved
[05:19:09] <Cork> then you just apply it
[05:19:16] <Cork> there isn't any delay for transform
[05:20:22] <Technodrome> these are transforms yeah Cork
[05:21:07] <Cork> Technodrome: then you can just do them in the same call
[05:21:22] <Technodrome> i was doing the css in an actual CSS file
[05:21:25] <Cork> as that is just values and you don't need to take anything special in consideration
[05:21:33] <Cork> as you should
[05:21:34] <Technodrome> mind if i show you the url? you will know what i mean right away
[05:21:51] <Cork> Technodrome: don't have time to dig through a page
[05:21:56] <Technodrome> ok
[05:22:19] <Technodrome> basically every element is top left , transforms move it into place, i need to add a padding
[05:22:56] <Technodrome> i add the padding, it goes into the original position, like before the transform, so it doesn’t affect it after the transform is done
[05:25:39] <fat> what am i doing wrong cork?
[05:34:37] <BrazenBraden> I dont get it... when I click the "add new record" button which is only mean to $.load in a new form, my log pumps out two responses from the server.. one GET (what I expect) followed by one POST (not meant to be there) https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/0caf57b74757c3b5cbb2
[05:34:57] <BrazenBraden> maybe I should ask in the RoR channel...
[05:34:58] <BrazenBraden> sorry
[05:35:46] <mrd2k> hey guys, is there a simple way for opening a popup out of a popup in jquery mobile?
[05:43:54] <HamburgerBurglar> Greetings, is there a way to trigger an opacity change when a slideToggle is halfway done ? I have been looking into progress attr of slideToggle but can't seem to make sense out of it.
[05:44:17] <cnick> hello
[05:44:32] <cnick> why doesn't delay work in this chain? $("#div").hide().delay(2000).text(var).show();
[05:44:51] <cnick> it shows the text instantly, not 2 seconds later
[05:44:51] <HamburgerBurglar> Because your not telling it what to delay
[05:45:19] <HamburgerBurglar> delay(duration, next action)
[05:45:39] <cnick> oh...
[05:45:51] <HamburgerBurglar> .text isn't a show function
[05:46:47] <cnick> ok, I guess I'll have to read more about delay
[05:46:48] <cnick> thanks
[05:46:52] <HamburgerBurglar> It would probably be something like .delay(2000, var.show());
[05:47:44] <cnick> actually, what I'm trying to achieve is a very basic "typewriter"
[05:47:57] <Cork> you woudl have to wrapp .show in a function
[05:48:01] <Cork> but yes that is correct
[05:48:17] <cnick> and I wanted to output one char after another in a div
[05:48:45] <HamburgerBurglar> Why not just delay an append ?
[05:48:48] <Cork> $("#div").hide().delay(2000).queue(function() { $(this).text(var).show() $(this).dequeue(); };
[05:49:13] <Cork> cnick: also i would recommend not using .delay for this
[05:49:17] <Cork> use setTimeout
[05:49:21] <HamburgerBurglar> ^
[05:49:23] <Cork> or even better requestAnimationFrame
[05:51:29] <fat> Cork: I changed thIndex to $(this).index() from th.index(). Where is my mistake? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2503/
[05:52:07] <Cork> fat: is there a reason why you want back to the old filter loop code?
[05:52:36] <fat> It's the same one you gave me, i didn't change it
[05:53:53] <Cork> you reverted back to the code before we replaced it with .sort
[05:54:11] <Cork> and your using jquery 1.4 it doesn't have .on
[05:56:14] <fat> Cork: This is the one you gave me http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2484/ where you "only fixed the errors at the top"
[05:56:17] <fat> i started to work on that
[05:56:58] <Cork> and that one is just the one you gave me with the handler code at line 1 and 2 fixed
[05:57:16] <fat> ok
[05:57:16] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2483/
[05:57:52] <Cork> so you lost the changes somewhere along the line...
[05:59:06] <fat> Cork: how does this look http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2508/ ?
[06:19:27] <fat> Cork: it sorts only once though http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2525/
[06:20:05] <fat> line 9 is not required i think
[07:06:58] <hactor> Folks when I pass $('<div ...>...</div>') what actually is used to parse it. A custom jQuery parser or the native DOM browser one?
[07:10:08] <Xtrivity> Hi guys, can any of you tell me of a plug-in or jquery code to replicate what they did with the text on http://hey.im (i've seen it on many sites, and know there's some prebuilt option, just can't find it on google)
[07:10:18] <BillCriswell> hactor: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-html-ownerDocument
[07:19:24] <BillCriswell> Xtrivity: http://www.onextrapixel.com/2013/08/27/super-simple-text-rotator-with-almost-no-effort-required/ looks promising.
[07:20:32] <Xtrivity> BillCriswell, thanks boss!
[07:22:25] <BillCriswell> Xtrivity: No problemo.
[07:27:36] <Kenshou> Does anybody know about a library that allows me to drag and drop a pin into a container?
[07:28:57] <BillCriswell> Kenshou: jQuery UI can do it.
[07:29:36] <BillCriswell> Make the container a droppable, make the pin a draggable.
[07:32:19] <Kenshou> BillCriswell, thanks, i'll look into that
[07:36:43] <tocka> hi
[07:50:08] <tocka> hi, i get a json response (being generated by php) but when I try to do a JSON.parse() it gives me an error
[07:50:09] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/mm1Rn57A
[07:50:23] <tocka> the error is: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 2 of the JSON data
[07:50:32] <tocka> I validated json and it is valid
[07:50:35] <tocka> not sure whats wrong...
[07:52:52] <bumbar__> any recommendations on table sort plugins/libs? i'm trying tablesorter now, but doesn't seem to have option to sort data after appending to table
[07:53:24] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: datatables doesn't seem too bad.
[07:54:15] <BillCriswell> I can usually help people with that pretty quickly when they come in here cause the docs are nice.
[07:54:59] <bumbar__> can it sort itself after an insert?
[07:55:55] <hactor> BillCriswell, thanks :D
[07:56:58] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:57:11] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: I can't imagine it not being able to.
[07:57:54] <slax0r> tocka: are you sure that's the json? did you console.log it?
[07:58:03] <tocka> yeah :/
[07:58:21] <tocka> i get one object in the console slax0r
[07:58:46] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: http://www.datatables.net/examples/api/add_row.html
[07:59:04] <slax0r> tocka: if you get the object, you don't need to parse anymore
[07:59:11] <tocka> hmmmm
[07:59:16] <bumbar__> BillCriswell, thanks
[07:59:23] <slax0r> try console.log(json.id);
[07:59:56] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:59:59] <tocka> slax0r i had to put myJson[0].something
[08:00:05] <tocka> slax0r thanks:)
[08:00:10] <slax0r> ah yeah, because you have an array first
[08:00:22] <hactor> BillCriswell, so basically <div>,  <div/> and <div></div> will all use .createElement. I just can't understand if I should feel "bad" about passing unclosed <div> as long as it has no attributes, or it's ok?
[08:00:31] <slax0r> tocka: np
[08:00:58] <BillCriswell> hactor: I'd do my best to only pass valid html.
[08:01:28] <slax0r> tocka: $.ajax or any of its variants will parse json automatically, so you don't have to worry with it
[08:01:40] <tocka> didnt know that
[08:01:41] <tocka> thanks!
[08:02:25] <hactor> BillCriswell, but this means <div/> is also invalid :P
[08:02:41] <hactor> BillCriswell, should we spell out <div></div> for simple block element creation?
[08:02:45] <BillCriswell> Yeah, and that causes issues in old IE.
[08:03:05] <BillCriswell> hactor: I do typically.
[08:03:29] <hactor> BillCriswell, ok thanks. Last q.  the variant with attributes is not documented to support ownerDocument, is that a doc error?
[08:03:49] <hactor> $('html', {attributes}, --> no ownerDocument here <--)
[08:04:19] <BillCriswell> Yeah, looks like jQuery() takes two arguments max.
[08:04:43] <hactor> Aw :(
[08:04:57] <hactor> BillCriswell, thanks a lot
[08:05:02] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:08:58] <Dejavu86> Hi I'm searching a way to send a form without a submit button, only on click a checkbox - the form method is get
[08:08:59] <tharkun> I've come to the conclusion that people are somewhat more sensitive to a nicee looking frontend than to a fast moving backend. Regardless of how much time they spend dealing with it.
[08:09:49] <bumbar__> BillCriswell, on insert/delete to table, can i just datatables constructor with order option?
[08:11:53] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: Seems so.
[08:13:33] <hactor> Folks does anyone know which file/part I should be looking at for the $('<foo>') implementation on GitHub?
[08:15:54] <BillCriswell> hactor: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/init.js is it I think.
[08:16:09] <hactor> :D
[08:20:42] <torbjorn> in jquery mobile.. there seems to be really nice widgets/graphical components for most kind of input and form controls, but what about normal text?
[08:20:57] <torbjorn> http://jsfiddle.net/jhh36hc7/ # that text doesnt look right
[08:21:09] <torbjorn> but i cant seem to find how that is meant to be done right
[08:21:23] <hactor> BillCriswell, you know, jQuery sometimes is overloaded in so many subtle ways that can be lost, that I just hope it does NOT have many contributors that could "improve" it and break all my code :P
[08:21:50] <KamalKaur> ljoin #javascript
[08:21:57] <BillCriswell> hactor: I'm sure the tests are thorough enough to be okie dokie.
[08:22:48] <hactor> BillCriswell, good point, but it's really kinda scary when you read it still... "oh is the second param a plain object? no? it's ownerDocument. Yes? does it have methods? let's call them. oh they're not methods, call attr() on them!"
[08:23:01] <hactor> BillCriswell, and there are no references to the doc or anything in the source code :P
[08:24:43] <bumbar__> if i init multiple tables with datatables with single statement, how can i get datatables object?
[08:27:57] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: You mean like.. var first = $('table').eq(0).DataTable() ?
[08:28:24] <juslintek> Hi, how to destroy all popovers on document?
[08:28:59] <juslintek> how to destroy all popovers on document on keydown.
[08:29:42] <juslintek> I'm going from $(this).parent('table').closest('.popover').popover('destroy');
[08:30:09] <bumbar__> BillCriswell, yes, but that also reinitialises other options (like search bar and pagination)
[08:30:20] <bumbar__> also, sorting doesn't seem to work with real numbers
[08:42:28] <someguywhatever> hey guys, how do I add another selector? like: var whatever = $("#parent"); how would I select an h1 that is under that parent? like something like: $("#parent").$("h1")
[08:42:41] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: http://jsfiddle.net/z4uuuaua/ this is what I meant I think.
[08:43:06] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: Can you replicate on that fiddle? Might be misunderstanding.
[08:45:41] <BillCriswell> Oh wait I see now.
[08:47:56] <someguywhatever> well thanks for NO help guys. it was .add()
[08:48:28] <bobbyr> hello, i have a question for you guys
[08:49:20] <bobbyr> i have 2 callbacks on a page --  a .change() that binds to a drop down and a .submit() which binds to a form
[08:49:45] <bobbyr> prior to submitting, the change() function works as intended
[08:50:14] <bobbyr> but when the submit() callback gets proc'd, it stops working
[08:50:28] <someguywhatever> show us the code bobbyr
[08:50:45] <robertmaxrees> someguywhatever you want to find H1s under #parent?
[08:50:50] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[08:51:02] <someguywhatever> robertmaxrees I found it, I was looking for .add()
[08:51:05] <someguywhatever> thanks
[08:51:14] <bobbyr> http://pastebin.com/FiCrH9AX
[08:51:24] <robertmaxrees> "how would I select an h1 that is under that parent? like something like: $("#parent").$("h1")" threw me off.
[08:51:28] <bobbyr> i think it's because im caching the selectors in variables
[08:51:30] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[08:51:45] <someguywhatever> because I didn't want to keep re-typing $("#parent")
[08:51:48] <someguywhatever> so I assigned it
[08:51:49] <bobbyr> thoughts someguywhatever?
[08:52:49] <robertmaxrees> bobbyr "it stops working" doesn't help - what doesn't work?
[08:52:58] <bobbyr> the action no longer procs
[08:53:11] <BillCriswell> someguywhatever: No problem.
[08:53:17] <bobbyr> before i submit, the callback code execs
[08:53:21] <bobbyr> after, it does not
[08:53:27] <robertmaxrees> could you set this up in a fiddle with your markup?
[08:53:35] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if the ajax doesnm'
[08:53:38] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't work
[08:53:41] <bobbyr> ok
[08:55:17] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: This api isn't super intuitive to me right now haha
[08:56:41] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: I guess you could just trigger the click on the sort option you want.
[08:57:47] <BillCriswell> Er, I imagined that problem lol
[08:58:28] <bobbyr> http://jsfiddle.net/6dcbgq3q/
[08:58:57] <bobbyr> it's hard to communicate the problem without the ajax actually doing anything
[08:59:49] <robertmaxrees> bobbyr are you replacing anything via your ajax?
[09:00:09] <robertmaxrees> and if so, is that what's breaking?
[09:04:12] <robertmaxrees> bobbyr yep - that's looks like your issue.  when you do $formContainer.html(data);, you're destroying a bunch of elements and, consequently, their bindings.  check out using event delegation to handle this instead.
[09:04:28] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: Ok, I did what I think this plugin should have been doing originally...
[09:05:07] <bobbyr> robertmaxrees thanks
[09:05:13] <robertmaxrees> that make sense?
[09:05:38] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: http://jsfiddle.net/z4uuuaua/1/
[09:06:37] <bobbyr> robertmaxrees, yeah it does... i figured that that was what the problem was
[09:06:51] <bobbyr> i am a frontend noob though and I wanted a second opinion
[09:06:53] <BillCriswell> bbuThen you can do like $tables.eq(0).data('dataTable').row() blah blah blah.
[09:06:56] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[09:07:49] <BillCriswell> bumbar__: * ^^
[09:08:52] <Blaster> What's the best way to load all the pages of my site via AJAX?  Do I just load the page with $.ajax and just use replace?
[09:09:11] <robertmaxrees> Blaster really depends on what all you're doing.
[09:09:14] <Blaster> I want to make one of those fully ajax sites.
[09:09:30] <Blaster> Instead of using page reloads to switch pages I want them to load over ajax.
[09:09:33] <robertmaxrees> update your main content area only and you should be fine.
[09:09:40] <Blaster> Alright.
[09:09:48] <robertmaxrees> though understand that this can kill SEO.
[09:10:03] <Blaster> Oh really? Why's that?
[09:10:19] <robertmaxrees> Google doesn't really handle javascript very well unless you follow some special rules.
[09:10:29] <Blaster> Okay.
[09:10:30] <bobbyr> robertmaxrees what about pushState to fix that
[09:10:38] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:10:51] <bobbyr> map content to URL?
[09:10:51] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change that google doesn't handle advanced javascript very well.
[09:10:52] <Blaster> What's pushState?
[09:10:53] <bobbyr> better SEO
[09:11:03] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change the crawling part of the problem.
[09:11:13] <robertmaxrees> pushstates let you update the url, Blaster
[09:11:17] <bobbyr> true
[09:11:19] <Blaster> I guess I would need to code something that loads the proper page when you go to a specific URL.
[09:11:24] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[09:11:34] <Blaster> What if a URL opens a modal?  Is that bad for SEO?
[09:11:36] <robertmaxrees> and make sure you fallback to non-ajax when the user can't support it.
[09:11:50] <Blaster> I don't care about people without Javascript enabled.
[09:11:51] <robertmaxrees> depends entirely on how you're doing stuff.
[09:12:34] <robertmaxrees> also pushstates aren't supported in IE9 and older
[09:12:47] <robertmaxrees> chrome has (had?) a pretty nasty bug affecting them for a long time, too.
[09:13:04] <robertmaxrees> check out something like this: https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[09:13:29] <robertmaxrees> requires some backend love, but doable.
[09:14:10] <duckxx_> how do i detect a .toggle state? currently i have  jQuery(".but1, .but2").toggle( "state1??": function() but im getting errors on the state1 as that doesn't seem to work. im guessing my syntax is wrong..
[09:14:10] <Blaster> Thanks.
[09:14:31] <duckxx_> a lot of the toggle states found on google has to do with visbility of elements
[09:14:50] <robertmaxrees>  jQuery(".but1, .but2").toggle( "state1??": function() wat
[09:16:32] <robertmaxrees> duckxx_ what are you trying to do?
[09:16:40] <robertmaxrees> because that line doens't make any sense.
[09:17:00] <duckxx_> currently what i have is but1 and but2, when clicked it shows an overlay and then blurs the background. the problem is that when i hit but1 it will show the overlay and then blur the background, but now when i hit but2 it will disable the overlay and then blur the background again because its firing it again and doesn't know but1 toggle state that it already blured the background.
[09:17:16] <duckxx_> jQuery(".but1, .but2").toggle( "state1": function() {  fire1 }, "state2": function() { fire2 });
[09:18:01] <robertmaxrees> this is why i don't like toggles.
[09:18:09] <robertmaxrees> explicitly run your logic instead.
[09:18:19] <robertmaxrees> check the state and go from there.
[09:18:30] <duckxx_> basically the buttons need to know each others toggle state... one solution is to add a class to an element to keep track of the state and have each button execution to check for that class
[09:18:41] <robertmaxrees> right - toggle is the wrong thing to use in this case.
[09:19:49] <duckxx_> but1 is the overlay button.. and but2 is really the close button on the overlay
[09:20:08] <robertmaxrees> not sure how else i can phrase what i just said - you don't want toggle in this case.
[09:20:20] <robertmaxrees> because the implicit nature is killing you.
[09:20:30] <duckxx_> i guess the only way is to use conditionals to check if an injected class is there or not
[09:20:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll spend more time working around that than just writing things explicitly and dealing with it.
[09:20:43] <duckxx_> ic
[09:20:44] <robertmaxrees> so don't use toggle.
[09:40:03] <MikeD_> is there a jquery-based polyfill for position:sticky; ?
[09:40:30] <robertmaxrees> not as a "polyfill", not.
[09:40:34] <robertmaxrees> but there are plugins to handle it.
[09:41:03] <MikeD_> how do i know which to use?
[09:42:11] <robertmaxrees> do you need a polyfill or a plugin?
[09:42:13] <robertmaxrees> there's a distinction.
[09:43:08] <MikeD_> i think i'd prefer to not care about distinctions... so whatever I can employ and forget about :)
[09:43:55] <robertmaxrees> this is actually kind of an important distinction.  if you want to be able to use position: sticky; "natively", then you want the polyfill.  a jquery plugin is going to require you to select the element with JS and apply a method.
[09:44:01] <MikeD_> a google result indicates there are many plugins - so in general, how does one assess which jquery plugin is the one I want to be using?
[09:44:55] <robertmaxrees> I check out the repo and see how recently it's been updated, how many stars/watchers/forks, and i check the api.
[09:44:58] <robertmaxrees> then i test it out.
[09:45:26] <MikeD_> cool, thanks
[09:51:42] <MarioD> hey guys!
[09:51:53] <hami> Hey
[09:51:53] <darcyclarke> Marioooooooooooooooo!
[09:52:19] <MarioD> back to hang out and ask random noob questions once in a while :-P
[09:53:15] <darcyclarke> $('#MarioD').askAway();
[09:53:52] <MarioD> darcyclarke: haha in due time - almost finished the little app I was working on yesterday
[09:54:07] <MikeD_> $('[name="MarioD"]').askAway();
[09:57:45] <PeterPorka> hello all, i have a problem getting values from items in a form after validation, here is my code:  http://pastebin.com/PK9tx09L thx for help
[09:58:07] <hami> how do I get previous location.pathname?
[09:58:32] <robertmaxrees> PeterPorka could you setup a fiddle with your validator included and everything?
[09:58:42] <hami> I am trying to implement current item highlighting on my nav bar.. but i need to remove the previous item current class attr
[09:59:05] <robertmaxrees> hami easier way - $('.active-class').removeClasse()
[09:59:11] <robertmaxrees> hami easier way - $('.active-class').removeClasse('active-class');
[09:59:22] <robertmaxrees> then do your logic to add the new active one.
[09:59:34] <hami> ok thanks let me try.
[10:00:08] <robertmaxrees> hami swap out the active-class name for whatever class you're using.
[10:00:16] <hami> yeah I understood that part :D
[10:02:53] <hami> works smoothly :)
[10:04:45] <hami> robertmaxrees although I have a problem if the url is this: http://localhost/car-rental3/
[10:04:49] <hami> xD
[10:04:52] <PeterPorka> robertmaxrees: uhh thats alot using jquery.remodal.min.js, jquery and jquery validator, this works if i pass the form form.elements["txtUsername"].value but only in chrome
[10:05:27] <MikeD_> everyone has a problem if the url is http://localhost
[10:05:52] <robertmaxrees> PeterPorka a small test case shouldn't be hard to put together. just need the bit for the validation.
[10:06:20] <hami> MikeD_ what ? lol
[10:06:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wxvbtm3n/ link in the hosted version of the validator under "external resources"
[10:06:24] <hami> its not a production site yet
[10:06:35] <robertmaxrees> PeterPorka otheriwse, that sounds like your selector is bad.
[10:06:41] <robertmaxrees> do you have multiple elements with that ID?
[10:06:42] <hami> it will probably never be a production site
[10:07:00] <PeterPorka> nope i checked carefully for double elements
[10:07:02] <robertmaxrees> hami huh?  url has nothing to do with what i did.
[10:07:33] <robertmaxrees> PeterPorka try running $("id=['txtUsername']").length in your console
[10:07:35] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[10:09:44] <PeterPorka> strange i am getting a short error message than redirekt
[10:10:12] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:10:20] <PeterPorka> also the whole  submitHandler: function(form) { does not work in ie after submit the form
[10:10:21] <robertmaxrees> what's the error message?
[10:10:34] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have something else going on.
[10:11:44] <PeterPorka> yeah, okay i have to change alot brb
[10:12:00] <PeterPorka> maybe i have got an idea, preventing the form action
[10:12:14] <robertmaxrees> the form validator should be handling that part for you, but OK.
[10:12:30] <PeterPorka> ah okay
[10:12:40] <PeterPorka> damn i thought that would be an idea
[10:15:07] <hami> sorry I disconnected
[10:16:04] <hami> should I add an extra li element with href="/" ?
[10:16:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:16:15] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with anything.
[10:17:52] <PeterPorka> adding this to the form action fixed ie bugs : action="javascript:;"
[10:17:58] <robertmaxrees> Petazz that's a hack.
[10:18:01] <robertmaxrees> err, PeterPorka
[10:18:05] <hami> it's that address that doesnt get recognized. localhost/car-rental3/ and localhost/car-rental3/index.php works the same but when I go to the latter I see the home as highlighted
[10:18:16] <PeterPorka> but it works
[10:18:22] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible rationale to do anything imo.
[10:18:42] <robertmaxrees> if that fixes it, explicitly bind to the submit event and preventDefault() on it.
[10:19:02] <robertmaxrees> hami how are you selecting them?
[10:19:02] <hami> huh?
[10:19:05] <PeterPorka> yes, you are right
[10:19:13] <hami> oh thought that was to me
[10:19:40] <hami> let me make a jfiddle for you robertmaxrees but I am currently eating
[10:20:17] <PeterPorka> okay, i removed that
[10:21:10] <hami> back robertmaxrees
[10:21:43] <hami> does jQuery work with JSFiddle?
[10:22:19] <Zarriff> Choose a jquery version in the library dropdown in the upper left corner.
[10:23:51] <hami> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/zka21he4/
[10:24:34] <robertmaxrees> :(
[10:24:47] <hami> lol ok
[10:24:50] <robertmaxrees> you need an attribute contains selector.
[10:24:52] <robertmaxrees> but that's hacky
[10:25:18] <hami> http://jsfiddle.net/zka21he4/1/
[10:25:28] <hami> ooh you did it yourself :D
[10:25:54] <hami> http://localhost/car-rental3/index.php whenever I go to this the homepage item gets highlighted
[10:26:02] <hami> but not when I go to this: http://localhost/car-rental3/
[10:26:18] <hami> so if I can redirect to index.php every time it will work?
[10:26:31] <robertmaxrees> that's a router issue.
[10:26:33] <hami> if I redirect this http://localhost/car-rental3/ to this http://localhost/car-rental3/index.php
[10:26:44] <robertmaxrees> that's a hack imo.
[10:26:44] <hami>  but it will solve the problem hehe
[10:26:51] <hami> what would you do?
[10:27:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd start by doing something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zka21he4/2/
[10:27:08] <NoiseEee> hami: can't your backend figure out what page you're on / what classes to write?  why is that being left to JS?
[10:27:16] <robertmaxrees> scope your attribute contains stuff.
[10:27:27] <NoiseEee> hami: why isn't your page properly formatted out of the gate?
[10:27:27] <robertmaxrees> then fix the urls you're printing out to be the correct ones.
[10:27:54] <hami> I use php. I really don't like it :D
[10:28:02] <hami> I like javascript better
[10:28:04] <hami> anyway
[10:28:23] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean that this is the right way to do it ;)
[10:28:23] <hami> this theme was not made by me.. It was something I found and I have modified it
[10:28:43] <robertmaxrees> i have to use coldfusion at work and hate it, but i still make it to what it should do, like format URLs correctly.
[10:28:49] <PeterPorka> is there another way to dispatch a submit after validation?
[10:29:11] <hami> robertmaxrees so Javascript isnt the right way to do this?
[10:29:24] <robertmaxrees> hami not the bit about fixing your URLs.
[10:29:35] <hami> whats wrong with the urls? :D
[10:29:43] <robertmaxrees> hami if you're doing full page reloads anyway, do it all on the server-side.
[10:30:03] <hami> oh ok so I need to use php to solve this? :D
[10:30:08] <robertmaxrees> hami yes.
[10:30:23] <robertmaxrees> PeterPorka validator should just work.
[10:30:30] <hami> ok I can try.
[10:30:32] <robertmaxrees> it should handle all of that for you.
[10:30:55] <PeterPorka> it does in chrome and ff but in ie it does not
[10:31:11] <robertmaxrees> what version of IE?  any errors?  etc.
[10:31:42] <PeterPorka> nope nor error, ie 11 just the windows closes and the page reloads with the get params
[10:31:50] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code then?
[10:31:56] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle.
[10:33:14] <hami> robertmaxrees http://www.websitecodetutorials.com/code/css/highlight-current-page.php what do you think about this second option on this page?
[10:33:16] <hami> bad?
[10:33:50] <robertmaxrees> hami are you just copy/pasting things and seeing what works?
[10:34:14] <hami> robertmaxrees I need to find the right way to do it. I don't know it myself.
[10:34:35] <robertmaxrees> you need to add a class to the url for the current page using PHP.
[10:34:40] <robertmaxrees> then use css to style that class appropriately.
[10:35:33] <hami> ok I think I have a solution
[10:37:01] <PeterPorka> thx for help, have to go off, tomorrow i'll come back ;) cu thx
[10:41:08] <hami> still doesn't work lol
[10:43:18] <MarioD> Noob question: how can I add an item to an array at a specific point [2] and shift the existing items after it over?
[10:43:56] <BillCriswell> MarioD: splice?
[10:44:07] <MarioD> Bill will look it up, thanks
[10:44:41] <MarioD> BillCriswell: exactly what I was looking for :D
[10:46:14] <dni> bochelli ascii me martin
[10:46:18] <dni> bochelli ascii dni martin
[10:46:19] <BillCriswell> MarioD: Be careful cause splice returns what it removed.
[10:46:49] <BillCriswell> MarioD: Used to throw me off pretty good, so figured a heads up couldn't hurt.
[10:47:02] <BillCriswell> I think that's called destructive or something.
[10:47:23] <MarioD> BillCriswell: thanks for the heads up, I'm using it to just insert for now - but I will keep that in mind :)
[10:49:19] <BillCriswell> Cool.
[10:49:37] <hami> dude it is not working !!! :S
[10:49:47] <MarioD> This is why this channel is so amazing, you'd never see a small pointer like that in a tutorial :-P
[10:49:59] <robertmaxrees> hami what isn't?
[10:50:01] <robertmaxrees> your php?
[10:50:08] <hami> oh wait :D oh wait
[10:50:39] <BillCriswell> Yeah this is a pretty solid channel.
[10:50:43] <BillCriswell> No one too jerky.
[10:50:47] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[10:51:17] <hami> WORKING NOW DUDE
[10:51:20] <hami> robertmaxrees
[10:51:29] <hami> with the php
[10:51:29] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[10:51:38] <hami> I dont know if my solution was good :)
[10:52:05] <hami> I added the variable before the header include
[10:52:13] <hami> $current = 'home'
[10:52:20] <robertmaxrees> I don't know anything about PHP, so...
[10:52:47] <hami> and then checked in each <anchor tag and echoed the class accordingly
[10:52:49] <hami> never mind
[10:52:50] <hami> it works
[10:52:55] <hami> it's just a small project for school anyway
[10:52:57] <hami> thanks for your help
[10:53:22] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[11:24:39] <reynierpm1> hi there, how do I compare if some value in a select option is an empty string? I am doing in this way if (tipoTramiteSolVal != 1 && tipoTramiteSolVal != "" && tipoTramiteSolVal != undefined ) { console.log(¨valid¨) } else { console.log(¨not valid¨) } but it does not work when option value is empty
[11:25:22] <reynierpm1> by empty option I mean <option value=¨¨>Empty value</option>
[11:25:30] <robertmaxrees> .val() === ''
[11:25:38] <robertmaxrees> what's an empty value.
[11:26:02] <robertmaxrees> *that's an empty value, sorry
[11:26:58] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees and for undefined I should check equal with triple =? (===)?
[11:27:09] <robertmaxrees> undefined vars or values?
[11:27:29] <robertmaxrees> for undefined checks i usually use != to capture cases when it might be null OR undefined.
[11:27:33] <robertmaxrees> or ==
[11:27:39] <robertmaxrees> (with coercion)
[11:27:51] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees thx that what I am looking for
[11:44:32] <toothe> is $ a variable in jquery?
[11:44:40] <Duvdevan> yes
[11:44:47] <toothe> ahh....that makes sense now.
[11:45:10] <robertmaxrees> $ is a shortcut for jQuery
[11:45:14] <Duvdevan> var jquerized = $;
[11:45:20] <robertmaxrees> which is the main object it introduces.
[11:45:38] <Duvdevan> jquerized('.someClass') works like $('.someClass')
[11:45:47] <robertmaxrees> jQuery('.someClass'), too.
[11:45:53] <toothe> its an object, correct? and it pretty much has a ton of functions
[11:46:03] <robertmaxrees> everything in JS is an object.
[11:46:06] <Duvdevan> yes
[11:46:10] <robertmaxrees> so yes
[11:46:13] <toothe> i see..
[11:46:50] <robertmaxrees> it allows you to create new objects that inherit a bunch of methods
[11:46:57] <toothe> right.
[11:55:46] <MarioD> Finished v1 of my script! :D http://dongerlist.com/create-donger if anybody wants to check it out, just click the Generate button
[11:56:22] <MarioD> it uses some basic logic for now, going to improve the code and make it a little more complex over time
[11:56:51] <MarioD> was an awesome way to learn some basic js
[12:11:26] <Scriptonaut> is it bad practice to select something from inside of it?
[12:12:12] <MarioD> from within the textbox?
[12:12:19] <Scriptonaut> eg. <div class="blah"><script>$(document).ready(function() { $('.blah').doSomething(); })
[12:12:23] <Scriptonaut> like that
[12:12:28] <Scriptonaut> oh, pretend I added </script></div>
[12:13:19] <MarioD> sorry, not really sure what you mean
[12:13:25] <BillCriswell> Scriptonaut: It's not ideal.
[12:13:30] <Scriptonaut> BillCriswell, why's that
[12:16:27] <rubyonrailed> How can I do an event when just the background is clicked?
[12:16:40] <rubyonrailed> $('body') is the entire page, and $('body background') doesn't do anything
[12:17:21] <BillCriswell> Scriptonaut: The browser has to execute what's going on as it comes across it instead of all in one shot at the end
[12:17:31] <BillCriswell> The loading can seem slower.
[12:18:09] <BillCriswell> The background wouldn't technically be the whole element either way, but I think you might be confused. What's your goal?
[12:18:47] <rubyonrailed> I want to be able to click the background image, and trigger an upload to change it
[12:19:51] <BillCriswell> Ok, you can't click background images, just an element that has one.
[12:20:51] <rubyonrailed> True
[12:24:51] <BillCriswell> rubyonrailed: If you just want something to trigger if you click on the body and not one of it's children you can do like $('body').on('click', function (event) { if (event.target === this) { alert('You clicked on <body>'); } });
[12:26:32] <BillCriswell> event.target is the actual element that was clicked and checks to see if it's `this` (which is body).
[12:28:02] <rubyonrailed> Cool, that doesn't seem to be working though
[12:28:41] <MarioD> Make sure you don't have any divs over the body element?
[12:41:39] <Hypfer> hi, I'd like to have a constantly and slowly rotating cicle image and also do something every time it has rotated 360°
[12:45:32] <BillCriswell> Hypfer: What kind of "something"?
[12:47:34] <Hypfer> BillCriswell: a "something has fallen into water" wave which moves from the center of the image and slowly fades out
[12:47:40] <Hypfer> (the image is a perfect circle)
[12:49:02] <Hypfer> perfect as in svg circle
[12:51:50] <MarioD> One approach would be to rotate the circle using css 2d transforms: then listen for when the animation completes and 'do something'
[12:51:59] <MarioD> css 2d transforms: http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_2dtransforms.asp
[12:52:20] <MarioD> detect css 2d animation complete: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/using-jquery-to-detect-when-css3-animations-and-transitions-end
[12:54:02] <BillCriswell> The ripple effect wolud be fun to create
[13:02:39] <BillCriswell> damn, can't animate pseudos.
[13:03:40] <Jacta> Can anyone help me solve this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26755537/script-error-when-using-identical-feature-in-bootstrapvalidator
[13:06:08] <robertmaxrees> errors only when they do match.
[13:06:09] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:06:48] <Jacta> Yes and I can't figure out what I've done wrong - tried to do as the author wrote
[13:07:13] <Jacta> http://bootstrapvalidator.com/validators/identical/
[13:08:06] <robertmaxrees> start from the beginnign and tweak one thing at a time.
[13:08:09] <robertmaxrees> until you get the error
[13:13:21] <ccmonster> if a endpoint responds with 'yes' or 'no' how do I trigger the done/error ajax callbacks?
[13:13:33] <ccmonster> is there a way to make no trigger the .error() callback?
[13:13:52] <robertmaxrees> the request didn't fail.
[13:13:56] <robertmaxrees> it successfully returned.
[13:14:26] <ccmonster> k
[13:16:52] <Hypfer> hm
[13:16:58] <Hypfer> still working on the ripple :(
[13:28:11] <Hypfer> http://jsfiddle.net/3xxn4Lqf/
[13:28:35] <Hypfer> no idea how to ripple
[13:28:55] <BillCriswell> Hypfer: Why are you doing that in javascript?
[13:29:37] <ccmonster> what sort of ripple? and for what?
[13:29:47] <BillCriswell> Going to kill machines doing this lol
[13:30:41] <BillCriswell> Hypfer: http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/ would something like the first dot here work?
[13:30:56] <Hypfer> BillCriswell: because It should become an indicator for.. well.. flow of current, of data and so on
[13:31:09] <BillCriswell> yeah but CSS can just rotate that for you.
[13:31:40] <Hypfer> BillCriswell: how? could you edit that fiddle?
[13:38:39] <BillCriswell> Every time I try to use a css animation something goes weird.
[13:43:32] <BillCriswell> omg
[13:44:48] <BillCriswell> Hypfer: http://jsfiddle.net/3xxn4Lqf/2/
[13:44:57] <BillCriswell> I was typing translate instead of transform
[13:45:27] <BillCriswell> Er, Hypfer: http://jsfiddle.net/3xxn4Lqf/3/
[13:46:58] <Hypfer> BillCriswell: but now I cannot ripple on 360 degrees, right?
[13:49:36] <BillCriswell> Hypfer: http://jsfiddle.net/3xxn4Lqf/4/
[13:52:02] <BillCriswell> You'll need to add the other browser prefix stuff but that should get you mostly there.
[13:52:42] <BillCriswell> Hypfer: http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/ this could make that a lot easier as wel.
[13:53:24] <Hypfer> oh god this is driving me nuts
[13:53:46] <BillCriswell> lol
[13:53:49] <Hypfer> http://jsfiddle.net/3xxn4Lqf/5/
[13:53:59] <Hypfer> I cant get the ripple on the same spot
[13:55:30] <MarioD> Hypfer what are you trying to do exactly? I can try to help
[13:55:56] <BillCriswell> He wants the dot to match up with the thing coming up from below.
[13:56:07] <MarioD> so the ripple to come out of the moving dot?
[13:56:12] <robertmaxrees> Hypfer also you can't do self-closing DIVs fyi
[13:57:03] <Hypfer> not exactly
[13:57:22] <Hypfer> I want to ripple from the wole circle thingy if the dot is at 12 o clock
[13:57:30] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[13:57:54] <BillCriswell> Well, that iteration event should help make that a little less crazy.
[13:58:33] <decx> :after on circle for the scaling thing to do it css only
[13:59:34] <BillCriswell> What decx says is usally right.
[13:59:40] <BillCriswell> Watch Short Poppies yet?
[13:59:46] <Hypfer> but I dont understand it :)
[13:59:51] <decx> could be nonsense i havent looked at any code today
[14:00:46] <BillCriswell> or nonsense.
[14:02:06] <BillCriswell> I have to run. Later
[14:02:17] <Hypfer> so.. any Idea MarioD ?
[14:02:55] <MarioD> Hypfer: yup, 1 sec I'll try some things out
[14:03:23] <MarioD> and you want it to come out of the center of the parent circle where the rotation is happening?
[14:04:03] <Hypfer> MarioD: exactly :)
[14:04:11] <MarioD> kk give me a few mins
[14:14:52] <MarioD> http://jsfiddle.net/3xxn4Lqf/29/
[14:16:24] <Hypfer> MarioD: amazing :)
[14:16:32] <MarioD> Hypfer: ;-P
[14:24:30] <Hypfer> thanks :)
[14:55:39] <tkdaj> is there an attribute on a jquery table which knows how many immediate tr children it has?
[14:55:46] <tkdaj> or do you have to use selectors for that?
[14:55:57] <robertmaxrees> you could easily select that.
[14:56:26] <tkdaj> ($(element).find(' > * > tr:last').index() + 1) right?
[14:56:32] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:56:52] <tkdaj> that's what I was using and it worked, but then I changed where the code was and now it isn't
[14:56:53] <robertmaxrees> $('table').children('tr').length
[14:57:02] <tkdaj> oh... does that count nested trs?
[14:57:11] <robertmaxrees> .children() goes one level.
[14:57:12] <tkdaj> like inside of nested tables
[14:57:14] <tkdaj> oh okay
[14:57:16] <tkdaj> thanks
[14:57:25] <robertmaxrees> .find() goes deep
[14:58:03] <tkdaj> oh okay
[14:59:34] <sammych1> I'm just here to vent that jQM popup performance on old tablets is horrible.
[14:59:57] <robertmaxrees> go talk to the folks in #jquery-dev :)
[15:00:32] <sammych1> I've never gotten a response in that room
[15:00:50] <robertmaxrees> you could also submit a bug
[15:00:59] <sammych1> the redraw and repositioning, it's so painful
[15:01:39] <sammych1> I'm just gonna move the popup into it's own page
[15:02:28] <sammych1> which is easy enough, actually
[15:03:27] <rubyonrailed> I'm using jquery to display a preview of a uploaded image.  It's currently resizing it to the dimentions that I set.  How can I make it crop the image to that size and not resize it?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e11e8fb11eea90d341e3
[15:04:23] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to use canvas and add in cropping.
[15:08:25] <tkdaj> when selecting children elements in a table do you have to worry about tbody and tfoot if you didn't use them?
[15:09:10] <tkdaj> because I am using $(element).children('tr').length where element is a table and it gives me zero
[15:10:49] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('table > tbody').children('tr')); should work
[15:12:01] <tkdaj> thank you :)
[15:12:09] <tkdaj> this ended up working too: $(element).find('*').children('tr').length
[15:12:18] <robertmaxrees> avoid the universal selector there.
[15:12:23] <tkdaj> why?
[15:12:31] <robertmaxrees> that'll find all TRs that are children of anything else.
[15:12:38] <robertmaxrees> taking you back to your previous problem,
[15:12:57] <tkdaj> ah... I see
[15:13:07] <tkdaj> I don't actually have any tbody's in my table
[15:13:17] <tkdaj> so will what you said still work?
[15:13:23] <robertmaxrees> the rendered table does though.
[15:13:48] <tkdaj> okay, that's what I was wondering
[15:14:34] <robertmaxrees> actually - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1a774wo3/
[15:15:19] <tkdaj> ugh... it is still giving me zero
[15:15:38] <tkdaj> what is the .eq(0)?
[15:15:40] <robertmaxrees> could you share the markup you're working against.
[15:16:00] <robertmaxrees> you want the first table > tbody
[15:16:08] <robertmaxrees> if you have nested tables, you can have more than one.
[15:17:06] <tkdaj> http://plnkr.co/edit/AwpwqYZnos2wOFfNeB9B?p=preview
[15:17:38] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:17:42] <tkdaj> actually, I just removed the controller
[15:17:43] <tkdaj> http://plnkr.co/edit/AwpwqYZnos2wOFfNeB9B?p=preview
[15:17:47] <tkdaj> so that one renders
[15:17:54] <tkdaj> that is just an example table so I can test what I am doing
[15:17:58] <robertmaxrees> err, paired down test case yo.
[15:18:05] <tkdaj> ?
[15:18:39] <robertmaxrees> no need for any of the angular funk.
[15:18:45] <tkdaj> gotcha
[15:19:06] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1a774wo3/1/ looks like it works here
[15:19:10] <tkdaj> http://plnkr.co/edit/AwpwqYZnos2wOFfNeB9B?p=preview
[15:19:12] <tkdaj> better?
[15:19:55] <tkdaj> it says the length is two, though
[15:20:20] <robertmaxrees> oh flaw in my logic
[15:21:09] <robertmaxrees> wait why can't you just give a class to the TR you want?
[15:21:27] <tkdaj> because I am making a directive to paginate tables which should be universal to any table
[15:21:41] <tkdaj> which is why I want to count all the TRs (not counting the one with TH in it)
[15:22:00] <robertmaxrees> so which tr do you want in this case?
[15:22:29] <tkdaj> if you look at the second table with the 'heading 1' 'heading 2' .... for the titles, I should get a count of 5
[15:22:51] <tkdaj> I just want to count them, not select a specific tr
[15:23:16] <robertmaxrees> you want to count the number of TRs in a specific table then?
[15:23:39] <tkdaj> should work for any table with tbody on it
[15:24:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:24:21] <tkdaj> should count all the trs in the tbody.  apparently, it automatically adds the headers to the tbody unless you specify thead, though. So, that's something I'll just have to do from now on for these
[15:24:34] <tkdaj> is put the tr with the th's in it in a thead
[15:25:26] <tkdaj> if I already have the table as a jQuery element, I would do $(table).find('tbody').children('tr').length
[15:25:27] <tkdaj> ?
[15:25:30] <tkdaj> would that work?
[15:25:32] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:25:44] <robertmaxrees> because .find() finds all tbody tags.
[15:25:55] <tkdaj> oh, even if it has nested tables you mean
[15:26:15] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19218483/jquery-find-only-not-nested-elements
[15:26:17] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[15:26:19] <robertmaxrees> a flat find.
[15:26:54] <robertmaxrees> also you're repeating IDs, which will cause you big headaches
[15:27:17] <tkdaj> where am I doing that?
[15:27:25] <robertmaxrees> pageTable
[15:27:30] <robertmaxrees> both tables have that ID
[15:27:34] <tkdaj> oh yeah
[15:27:46] <tkdaj> I didn't even notice that because I don't even use the IDs
[15:27:49] <tkdaj> not sure why I added them
[15:28:01] <tkdaj> when working with angular you don't have to do a lot of selecting based on id
[15:28:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't work with angular so i wouldn't know
[15:28:23] <tkdaj> yeah, I understand
[15:28:50] <robertmaxrees> partially because it overcomplicates a lot of things imo.  but either way - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1a774wo3/2/
[15:31:15] <tkdaj> how do you use the child selector when you already have the jQuery element?  I take it this doesn't work: $(element ' > body')
[15:31:27] <tkdaj> tbody*
[15:32:00] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[15:32:02] <tkdaj> or is > basically equivalent to .children()?
[15:32:29] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs :)
[15:32:30] <tkdaj> instead of doing $('table > tbody')
[15:32:37] <tkdaj> I already have what table is
[15:32:42] <robertmaxrees> use the methods btw :)
[15:32:49] <tkdaj> ?
[15:33:44] <robertmaxrees> use .children()
[15:34:47] <tkdaj> ah, gotcha
[15:37:18] <burzum2> hi
[15:38:15] <robertmaxrees> hello
[15:41:18] <burzum2> I've already read this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4096451/creating-a-jquery-plugin-with-multiple-functions but it doesn't look like what I want to get done. How can I create a jquery plugin that implements two methods that share some code to call an API? I'm building a jquery plugin to make it easy to implement a like/unlike functionality in my frontend. So what I try to get done API
[15:41:18] <burzum2> wise is something like this $('.selector').unlike(options); and $('.selector').unlike(options);  But both methods would share some settings like the base API URL. Any best practice recommendations on that please?
[15:41:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:42:02] <robertmaxrees> both of those are the same calls btw.
[15:42:18] <burzum2> Copy and paste ;) I meant like() and unlike()
[15:42:30] <robertmaxrees> but you can create a big IIFE, define your logic, then add stuff to $.fn.like and $.fn.unlike
[15:43:02] <burzum2> IIFE?
[15:43:17] <robertmaxrees> (function() { /* your code here */ })()
[15:43:21] <burzum2> ah
[15:43:22] <robertmaxrees> that scopes it
[15:44:37] <burzum2> robertmaxrees, I'm not sure if I get you right, I'm not going to use $.fn but (function()...) instead? but how would that help me to get this done?
[15:44:43] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:44:55] <burzum2> Maybe I should just find me a plugin  that does this already and see how it does it :)
[15:45:06] <robertmaxrees> you'll define all your logic within that iife, and at the end you'll end up doing $.fn.like = function() {}
[15:45:12] <robertmaxrees> and te same with unlike
[15:46:30] <burzum2> Hmm ok, i'll try to figure it out, thank you
[15:46:47] <robertmaxrees> burzum2 have you read http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/ ?
[15:47:08] <burzum2> yes, but i couldnt find - or i didnt understand - how to do what I want based on that.
[15:47:20] <robertmaxrees> you're overcomplicating it ;)
[15:47:23] <burzum2> I understand how it works with a single method call
[15:47:53] <burzum2> probably, many people told me I tend to overcomplicate things ;) my riding teacher, some work mates, my gf my wing chun master... :)
[15:49:16] <burzum2> robertmaxrees ahh I think now I got it http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#protecting-the-alias-and-adding-scope this is what you tried to explain, right?
[15:49:34] <robertmaxrees> it's shown on the first page i showed you.
[15:49:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qdkbd6p2/1/
[15:49:42] <robertmaxrees> here you go.
[15:49:53] <robertmaxrees> two new methods, both sharing a function.
[15:50:13] <burzum2> yes, thats it, thank you. same as in the manualy I just didnt understood it the first time.
[15:50:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qdkbd6p2/2/ with additional protection to the $ variable internally
[15:50:35] <tkdaj> I figured out why it wasn't working for me. =) it was because of angular... It put an extra div in the dom directly below my table, so when I was selecting tbody as a child of table it never found anything
[15:50:52] <tkdaj> Sorry about the hassle tobertmaxrees, and thanks for the help
[15:50:59] <robertmaxrees> O.o i'd ditch angular btw
[15:51:06] <robertmaxrees> save your sanity
[15:51:12] <tkdaj> haha
[15:51:24] <tkdaj> it is definitely complicated
[15:51:36] <tkdaj> has a pretty steep learning curve, but once you figure out most things it is really helpful
[15:51:54] <robertmaxrees> there are plenty of alternatives that are better imo
[15:51:58] <burzum2> thanks again robertmaxrees, I finally understood it :)
[15:52:15] <robertmaxrees> tkdaj http://larseidnes.com/2014/11/05/angularjs-the-bad-parts/ :)
[15:52:15] <tkdaj> Like, once I am done with this directive I am writing, all I have to do to paginate a table is just type <table paginate-table>....</table>
[15:52:24] <robertmaxrees> burzum2 good!  i'm glad.
[15:52:33] <tkdaj> and it will automatically put in page numbers at the bottom and all the functionality
[17:06:56] <tejas-manohar> how do i delete all elements contained within <body></body> with jquery?
[17:15:34] <BillCriswell> document.body.innerHTML = '';
[17:15:53] <BillCriswell> Er, $('html').empty(); for something more jQuery.
[17:19:40] <jeffreylevesque> anyone here has used 'jquery-validate.js'?
[17:51:59] <cannap> yes
[17:52:13] <robertmaxrees> lots of people have
[17:55:20] <rubyonrailed> I want to click a button if a certain div is availible. This alerts if the div is rendered in the view. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c0ec426d7205d865fab8  But I cant' use .click with it.  What are my options?
[17:55:52] <robertmaxrees> .load() is probably the wrong listener.
[17:56:06] <robertmaxrees> define "available"
[17:56:37] <cannap> trigger
[17:56:57] <rubyonrailed> Sometime the div will be rendered in a view. But sometimes it won't
[17:57:00] <robertmaxrees> .click() is the same as .trigger('click');
[17:57:07] <rubyonrailed> But when it is, I want to click a hidden button
[17:57:10] <cannap> .on
[17:57:44] <robertmaxrees> so if the div exists, click a button?
[17:57:49] <rubyonrailed> yes
[17:58:01] <robertmaxrees> if ($('#theDiv').length) { $('#myButton').click() }
[17:58:16] <robertmaxrees> though I'd pull out the handler for the button and directly call that logic instead if possible.
[17:58:36] <robertmaxrees> using the UI as a way to proxy function calls is a great way to confuse yourself later.
[18:01:12] <rubyonrailed> Thanks, i'll take that into concideration
[18:01:37] <robertmaxrees> plus abstracting the function out makes it easier to reuse it later on.
[18:01:57] <cannap> if ($('div').visible(true)) { .. }
[18:02:11] <robertmaxrees> .visthat doesn't exist>.>
[18:02:18] <robertmaxrees> *.visible()
[18:02:47] <cannap> what
[18:02:48] <robertmaxrees> the :visible is another option, but i'd avoid the extra hit and check the .length() of the selector instead.
[18:02:55] <cannap> oh
[18:03:27] <cannap> thx for this info :D
[18:03:59] <robertmaxrees> :visible isn't a standard selector, so it's going to be a little slower, and in this case we just want to know if the element exists.
[18:05:53] <rubyonrailed> Thanks @robertmaxrees
[18:06:02] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[18:07:06] <robertmaxrees> btw drop the @ symbol - most folks use clinets that notify them when they're mentioned, but it breaks if you prepend something to the username.
[18:08:39] <rubyonrailed> Word
[18:10:36] <Robdgreat> besides, this isn't Twitter
[19:00:50] <viscera> What is the "s" key on line 30 in the last example on this page? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[19:02:48] <doug64k> viscera: a post parameter. data going to the post
[19:03:22] <doug64k> ends up urlencoded s=<value of input[name='s']>
[19:03:30] <doug64k> typically
[19:04:39] <viscera> thanks doug64k
[19:04:42] <doug64k> viscera: if that said $.post('x', { name: 'doug', lang: 'js', lib: 'jquery' }) it would post with urlencoded name=doug&lang=js&lib=jquery (but it is guaranteed to do it properly, and escape it)
[19:07:26] <viscera> doug64k: I see. So in my case I'm trying to POST an <input type="file" multiple> element, so I'd use a non-urlencode method, right? I'd want multipart form data encoding, apparently... and this is done with... foo.serialize()?
[19:07:46] <viscera> (or is there another jQuery option)
[19:08:49] <doug64k> viscera: you are trying to post a file with $.post? i know there is a way to get a file reader from the file input and give that to xhr send, to send the file. Not sure if jquery directly supports that
[19:09:11] <doug64k> viscera: you probably want a jquery file upload plugin
[19:11:36] <doug64k> viscera: you can use formdata to send it, create a new FormData(form) and pass that as data to $.post
[19:12:35] <doug64k> viscera: $.post returns a deferred. you should be able to setup .progress callback to get upload proress information
[19:12:48] <jeffreylevesque> viscera: https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/tree/master/src/js
[19:12:56] <jeffreylevesque> look at the ajax scripts
[19:13:21] <jeffreylevesque> ajax_data.js
[19:14:44] * viscera reads scrollback
[19:18:30] <viscera> doug64k: so how do formdata and $( #thing ).serialize() compare?
[19:19:10] <viscera> doug64k: the progress callback looks interesting as i need to implement a progress bar, thanks
[19:19:22] <doug64k> viscera: I doubt .serialize works. does it?
[19:19:40] <viscera> doug64k: check out the 4th example on the page I linked
[19:19:58] <viscera> jeffreylevesque: taking a look now, thanks
[19:21:14] <doug64k> viscera: ok. you are showing me that .serialize exists?
[19:21:42] <viscera> doug64k: that you can .post with a serialized object. Be gentle, I'm new :D
[19:23:10] <doug64k> viscera: yes, you can post with that, with normal forms. maybe it works for file inputs but I think it doesn't. What you can do is use the js FormData api, do new FormData(formElement) and pass that instead of that object in the post.
[19:23:58] <doug64k> viscera: says right there file elements are not serialized -> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[19:23:58] <viscera> doug64k: okay, thanks
[19:24:13] <viscera> doug64k: so it does. :$
[19:25:42] <doug64k> viscera:  $.post(action, new FormData($('#thing')[0])) assuming the form is #thing
[19:26:25] <doug64k> action is the url to post to - what would be the action on the form, in fact...
[19:28:09] <doug64k> var form = $('#someForm'), prom = $.post(form.prop('action'), new FormData(form[0])); prom.progress(function(a,b) { console.log(a, 'done out of', b); })
[19:28:46] <doug64k> viscera: ^
[19:29:11] <viscera> doug64k: thanks, I need to run to a meeting, I will check it all out when I get back :D
[19:29:53] <coldhead> lol meetings
[19:29:53] <b-ot> coldhead: You have 2 new messages, use `read when you wish to read them.
[19:30:09] <doug64k> :O
[19:34:14] <tw2113> long time no see coldhead
[19:46:48] <xsi> When here's an active talk, what kind of topics are discussed and how is it going? Could someone describe them in a nutshell?
[19:47:02] <fattest> Cork: I got it to work http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2534/ . What do you think of this? Is it efficient?
[19:49:23] <tw2113> evening Cork
[19:49:26] <tw2113> and Velveeta
[19:52:32] <fattest> Why isn't my table sorter not sorting properly? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2535/ it sorts "Facility name" column perfectly, but not the rest of the three columns.
[20:05:09] <Velveeta> hola hola
[20:06:06] <coldhead> i see you are also still alive, tw2113
[20:10:38] <coldhead> fattest: inside your click handler, `this` is your <tr class="sortable">, not your <th>
[20:10:57] <coldhead> i fixed it by using event.target instead of `this`: http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2541/
[20:13:21] <fattest> thanks so much
[20:49:20] <neruda> hi, trying to create dynamic tabs for a complex/nested form, my question is about making the form controls dynamic by giving them unique id, i haven't been able to understand how to pass a unique id to the form markup and the javascript controls
[21:50:56] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[21:52:27] <Uhkis> good morning
[22:00:25] <slavka`> hey guys... got question.. i want to back the html content of the page... and reinject it... maybe the code explains it better >>>> var temp = $('html').html(); $('html').html(null); $('html').html(temp); ... the problem is i loose the head and body tags... anyone got a way around this?
[23:08:35] <afroradiohead> writing event handlers in a clean way is difficult
[23:29:23] <fattest> I want a show hide content under table rows...Is this possible, where the additional content should not have columns? http://jsbin.com/diroboluqi/1/ ?
[23:37:17] <Cork> fattest: only option is to add a tr with a td with colspan
[23:47:07] <usrb1n> Hello, I have a form that get's submitted when an image is clicked. The images is inside a span and the span onclick is the following: document.getElementById('myForm').submit()
[23:47:44] <usrb1n> I am now trying to use jquery to detect when the form is submitted but I can't get it working with $('#myform').submit
[23:47:57] <usrb1n> Is it different when there is no input submit on the form ?
[23:48:27] <Cork> document.getElementById.submit doesn't trigger events
[23:48:43] <Cork> simplest solution is prob to use <input type="image">
[23:48:51] <Cork> then you get an image and a submit button
[23:49:59] <usrb1n> I am unable to modify the page source, this is a tool and I am creating an external "plugin" to improve its fuctionality.
[23:50:09] <usrb1n> Should I detect when the span is clicked ?
[23:51:30] <Cork> usrb1n: you could try removeAttr('onclick') and doing $('#myForm').submit() in a click handler
[23:53:09] <usrb1n> Nice, thank you Cork. Gonna give it a try.
