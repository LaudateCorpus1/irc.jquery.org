[09:15:08] <grid-> hey
[09:15:37] <grid-> can anyone tell me what is wrong with this example: https://jsfiddle.net/kpchnz2v/515/ ?
[09:18:23] <QuantumToronto> hi
[09:18:34] <grid-> this is the same in my eyes and it works: https://jsfiddle.net/d6sxcy18/
[09:18:52] <QuantumToronto> i use $(document).scroll(function() { ... and it triggers on the nromal page load. nobody is scrolling. i dont get that. actually fires three times
[09:25:41] <grid-> hmmm i see there is div id and select id in my example
[09:26:16] <QuantumToronto> lol ok i get it. if you load a page that has ben scrooled to the middle before the even fires as multiple times
[09:26:55] <Woet> grid-: you can't change the HTML without changing the selector.
[09:31:40] <grid-> Woet:  $("#DTE_Field_openeddoor select").on("change", function() { .. } will only work with <div id="DTE_Field_openeddoor" class="form-control"> and in the original page there is <select id="DTE_Field_openeddoor" class="form-control">, is there anything i can change about it so the $("#DTE_Field_openeddoor select").on("change", function() { .. } will work?
[09:39:22] <grid-> Woet: i think i have it working by using:   $("#DTE_Field_openeddoor").on("change", function() {
[11:04:42] <arunkumar413> Hi All
[11:06:00] <arunkumar413> I have ajax call like this: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/X3zvCfVW5R/
[11:06:34] <arunkumar413> how to make it redirect to another URL upon POST becoming success
[11:09:03] <Woet> arunkumar413: what have you tried so far?
[11:13:49] <arunkumar413> the code in the url
[11:15:51] <arunkumar413> Woet: If you want me to show I what I have done like a student to a teacher then, please don't help.
[11:16:06] <Woet> arunkumar413: you don't get to demand how I help you unless you pay my hourly rate, sorry
[11:16:19] <arunkumar413> Woet: Thank you
[11:16:26] <Woet> arunkumar413: the code you shared shows no attempt at what you're trying to achieve.
[11:16:37] <arunkumar413> Woet: Ok. Thank you
[11:17:21] <Woet> arunkumar413: the code shows an alert, you want a redirect. Google "redirect javascript", change the code accordingly, ask again if you run into issues.
[11:28:28] <grid-> hey could someone help me to reach my goal with the following: https://jsfiddle.net/7cd08pz1/ ?
[11:36:17] <grid-> i didnt came more far like this: https://jsfiddle.net/7cd08pz1/3/
[14:55:40] <grid-> hey
[14:55:58] <grid-> why works choices 2 only when already is a value set with the selectbox on choices 1? http://jsfiddle.net/wo3u09za/13/
[15:07:32] <grid-> i see i made a typo, fixed, used opendoor instead of openeddoor
[15:11:19] <grid-> i have a bunch of variables, and i want to combine them into one variable, but i don't want double spaces or spaces on the end, so myVar = visithistory + " " + currentvisit + " " + openeddoor + " " + different; isn't really working because sometimes i have empty variables, does anyone know a good trick for this?
[17:58:25] <spaces> how do I change a input to a span using jquery  ? I cannot find it anymore :(
[18:10:02] <spaces> seems to be more difficult then it looks
[18:10:23] <spaces> I was thinking I could change it based on class identifier
[18:26:10] <grid-> would anyone know howto use this if the beginning of the variable is ', ' instead of ',' myVar = (myVar[0] == ',') ? myVar.substr(1) : myVar; ?
[18:31:49] <grid-> i tried  myVar = (myVar[0] == ', ') ? myVar.substr(2) : myVar;
[18:31:55] <grid-> but not the desired results
[18:45:27] <spaces> no-one a clue ?
[18:47:32] <grid-> got already the desired results
[18:48:11] <pavonia> spaces: Why not removing the input and adding a new span element?
[18:48:55] <spaces> pavonia yes that was my other option but isn't that dirty ?
[18:49:51] <pavonia> I don't think so
[18:50:32] <spaces> ok, thanks :)
[18:50:56] <pavonia> Why do you even need that? You could have both and hide the one not needed
[18:51:28] <spaces> my framework builds the form an validates it, I only need it when a checkbox is selected
[18:51:44] <spaces> it's there but only as span instead of post if it's not checked
[18:52:35] <pavonia> Insert a hidden input perhaps
[18:53:46] <spaces> yeah or post it and just ignore it in my backend
[18:53:54] <spaces> I need to show something in it using JS
[18:54:03] <spaces> so then it could be a span, otherwise it's manual input
[19:56:14] <Someone_Else> When using gulp uglify to concatenate js files, one of the functions (jQuery plugin, $.fn.function) doesn't work anymore
[19:57:03] <Someone_Else> "Uncaught TypeError: jQuery(...).function is not a function"
[19:57:49] <Someone_Else> I'm sure the file is in the right order, so I suspect I'm not in the right scope
