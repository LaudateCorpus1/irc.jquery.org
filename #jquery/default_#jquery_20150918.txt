[00:03:21] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/arodht2g/6/ <--- what should line 35 be? how can I get the length?
[00:04:38] <Cork> Kartagis: field_fotograflar is an object, it dosen't have a length
[00:04:53] <Kartagis> uhm
[00:05:00] <Kartagis> what do I do?
[00:05:12] <Cork> not sure what it is you want to do
[00:05:42] <Cork> or more to the point: "what is it you want to do"
[00:05:49] <Kartagis> I want to get the number of src and alt pair
[00:05:53] <nodist> loop through the object?
[00:06:01] <Cork> Kartagis: it can only ever be one
[00:06:04] <Cork> at most
[00:06:35] <Kartagis> let me tell you why I want to do this
[00:06:36] <Cork> Kartagis: so if(f.nodes[0].node.field_fotograflar) { f.nodes[0].node.field_fotograflar.src }
[00:06:59] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/yyktn4jr/ <--- on the 55th line of jquery pane here, if the user has only 1 picture, it comes back undefined. why?
[00:07:38] <Cork> cause again field_fotograflar isn't an array
[00:07:52] <Cork> your asking for field_fotograflar.src.src
[00:08:33] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/yyktn4jr/1/
[00:08:56] <Cork> not sure if you need the if case, the object might always be there
[00:19:19] <Kartagis> yea, it worked
[00:19:23] <Kartagis> thanks a lot
[00:19:35] <Kartagis> plus, I don't need the if
[00:21:33] <Kartagis> heh
[00:22:00] <Kartagis> now it comes back undefined if the user has multiple pictures
[00:22:49] <Uhkis> holy..
[00:23:35] <Uhkis> Kartagis: at least make a function out of #53 :D

[00:32:36] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  do i need to get data that sends to client side with AJAX
[00:33:39] <Uhkis> you can't modify page source (if you mean browsers view source)
[00:34:22] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  i am talking about browser view source yes "view page source"
[00:34:34] <hellyeah> i≈ü have a tabular information i want to hide content
[00:41:02] <jungeeeeeee> Hello guys
[00:42:53] <nodist> hello
[00:48:50] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/arodht2g/7/ how can I get field_fotograflar here in console.log?
[00:52:48] <Uhkis> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/arodht2g/8/
[00:53:50] <d3m0n> How can I get the last click function to update a parent's silbing? http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/ojbRdw?editors=101
[00:53:59] <d3m0n> I tried closest and parent().siblings
[00:55:34] <slax0r> why would you want to do it like that?
[00:55:48] <slax0r> just a normal selector for .config-box .option-selected should get you what you need?
[00:56:26] <slax0r> and .parent() on your label is li
[00:57:41] <d3m0n> slax0r: Because theyres multiple boxes on the same page
[00:57:44] <d3m0n> So they need to be seperate
[00:57:47] <Uhkis> damn codepen is horrible
[00:58:06] <d3m0n> Really? I love codepen
[00:58:14] <d3m0n> I think jsfiddle is pretty terrble
[00:58:21] <Uhkis> there's no run button and it's too heavy to even type
[00:58:34] <d3m0n> crtl-r-5
[00:58:37] <d3m0n> err
[00:58:40] <d3m0n> crtl-shift-5
[00:58:49] <d3m0n> Reruns the code
[00:59:21] <slax0r> d3m0n: closest will go only up to parents, it wont find siblings, so you need to find the sibling of .option-selected with .closest('.options') and then search for its sibling .option-selected
[00:59:33] <Uhkis> jsfiddle is clearly the best of all those
[00:59:55] <d3m0n> slax0r: Thats why I have parent there
[01:00:03] <d3m0n> But still doesn't seem to wanna change
[01:00:20] <d3m0n> .parent = '.options', sibilings('option-selected') ?
[01:00:21] <slax0r> d3m0n: parent goes up only one
[01:00:28] <slax0r> no, parent is li
[01:00:29] <d3m0n> Ahhh
[01:00:35] <d3m0n> Gotcha
[01:00:43] <slax0r> http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/ojbRdw?editors=101
[01:00:49] <slax0r> hopefuly it took my changes
[01:01:19] <surianup> Hi all
[01:01:27] <surianup> I need a quick help please
[01:01:28] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/61g4gto9/5/
[01:01:32] <d3m0n> I got it working with your suggestions slax0r: thank you
[01:01:44] <surianup> I need to trigger a anchor but it is not working
[01:02:31] <slax0r> surianup: why onclick?
[01:02:39] <slax0r> why aren't you making a handler "the jquery way"
[01:03:26] <surianup> Actually I need to open the model box for confirmation when click on anchor
[01:04:06] <surianup> and then when click yes then triggeriing the next anchor for like same anchor
[01:04:51] <surianup> I don't have very good and vast in jquery just working with few such things
[01:05:25] <slax0r> inspec the dev tools
[01:05:30] <slax0r> because you've got errors...
[01:06:04] <surianup> No error therre
[01:07:24] <slax0r> var achor_link ='<?php echo URL::to('booking/accept') ?>/'+current_obj.id;
[01:07:27] <slax0r> I beg to differ
[01:08:24] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/61g4gto9/8/
[01:08:32] <surianup> leave its not using at all
[01:08:48] <surianup> I have removed it
[01:08:53] <slax0r> but why are you using onclick?
[01:09:00] <slax0r> jquery has other methods to attach event handlers
[01:09:31] <surianup> I don't know what I have used
[01:09:44] <surianup> What I have to use
[01:10:22] <surianup> because I am sending the id on the function
[01:26:24] <slax0r> surianup: https://api.jquery.com/click/
[01:58:44] <Kartagis> does jquery ui support page transitions? like when I click a button, the page slides is
[01:58:45] <Kartagis> in
[02:10:36] <Cork> Kartagis: you can only do that kind of transition if you load the second page through ajax
[02:10:56] <Cork> (there is specs for normal page load, but i don't think any browser support it yet)
[02:18:06] <Cyberian> Hi, I have a memory leakage problem with $.get and I don't know if maybe my Qt Webkit browser is the problem. I use setTimeout to regularly call itself. as soon as I add a $.get call to this function the memory consumption increases over time, although the callback function of the get call has only an empty body.
[02:18:31] <Cork> Cyberian: jsfiddle the code
[02:43:25] <Slartibart> However, now I need to intercept all those events, in a separate place, to reset an inactivity timer. And I don't want to have to maintain an .on("<list of all possible events in all namespaces>",...) beast. So my first attempt was jQuery.fn.trigger = function() { ... }, i.e. check if namespace in list, if so reset timer, pass the event to the real trigger(). But I guess that's not good design, so now I'm reading at http
[02:43:26] <Slartibart> s://learn.jquery.com/events/event-extensions/ . Would you say I'm on the right track, or should I be doing this differently?
[02:43:42] <Slartibart> Ok, so my code communicates internally by using events, with different namespaces depending on which part of the application that triggered it.
[02:45:01] <Cork> Slartibart: you don't need to maintain namespaces
[02:45:08] <Cork> namespaces works the other way around
[02:45:46] <Cork> meaning .on('click', func) will catch all events
[02:45:58] <Cork> namespace or no namespace
[02:49:23] <Slartibart> Cork: All click events, yes, and that's a good thing. But there are other events as well, more abstract. My ideal solution would be .on('<all events triggered by the application, i.e those with one of the namespaces>', function(){resetTimer();}), wouldn't I have to create like one copy of that for each event otherwise?
[02:50:06] <Cork> Slartibart: you would have to bind all native events either way
[02:50:27] <Cork> but yes, you would have to bind user defined events if you want them
[02:50:46] <Cork> mousemove and keydown is normally enough though
[02:50:56] <Cyberian> I think I have it running in jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/dzxs1me6/2/ On my embedded browser this consume more and more memory over time.
[02:51:39] <Cork> Cyberian: you don't want to run the timer outside the callback
[02:51:58] <Cork> Cyberian: that will mean if the server takes 201 ms to answer you will stack calls
[02:52:06] <Slartibart> Have to restart irc, brb
[02:52:18] <Cork> Cyberian: https://jsfiddle.net/dzxs1me6/3/
[02:52:46] <Cork> actaully you prob want to use always for the timer
[02:53:09] <Cork> Cyberian: https://jsfiddle.net/dzxs1me6/4/
[02:53:25] <Cyberian> I already tested this but memory still goes up
[02:53:43] <Cork> also function(){refreshInfo();} can be simplified to refreshInfo
[02:53:51] <Cork> apart from that it looks fine
[02:54:12] <Cork> so ya, if that leaks it is most likely the browser doing something wrong
[02:54:21] <nirakara> hi. I have this JS (https://dpaste.de/QsZs). When i click the allowPost button, i get "clicked" in console and nothing else. when I try clicking the button again i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'send' of null (https://github.com/jonashagstedt/swampdragon/blob/master/swampdragon/static/swampdragon/js/dist/swampdragon.js#L330) why would this be?
[02:54:56] <Cork> nirakara: define your variabled!
[02:55:08] <nirakara> I can also click any of the other .allowPost button and get the same error
[02:55:09] <Cork> your using a ton of globals there...
[02:55:16] <nirakara> Cork, right, sorry
[02:56:21] <nirakara> Cork, getting the same error with non globals
[02:56:36] <Cyberian> Cork, -.- that's bad for an embedded device that is going to run 24/7 and run out of memory in time x.
[02:56:44] <nirakara> Cork, seems to be a sockjs import issue
[02:57:04] <nirakara> Cork, suddenly sockjs disappears when that button is clicked
[03:00:36] <nirakara> Cork, any idea? why would clicking the button a second time cause this error?
[03:00:57] <nirakara> Cork, incidentally im not getting any data to the server but that's another story :/
[03:01:35] <Cork> nirakara: no, never used sockjs
[03:03:01] <nirakara> Cork, doesn't seem like a sockjs specific error
[03:04:09] <Cork> nirakara: the error is that socket on sockjs isn't defined
[03:04:21] <Cork> and i can't say why without knowing the lib
[03:04:40] <Cork> hmm, no not defined, isn't initiated
[03:09:42] <nirakara> Cork, but it only happends the _second_ time the button is clicked
[03:09:55] <nirakara> Cork, if it's not initialised, why not the first time it's clicked?
[03:10:23] <Cork> as i don't know when that variable is initiated, how would i be able to tell you that?
[03:11:44] <nirakara> Cork, initialised here https://github.com/jonashagstedt/swampdragon/blob/master/swampdragon/static/swampdragon/js/dist/swampdragon.js#L80
[03:14:12] <nirakara> Cork, i've found the problem. when the button is clicked the connection is immediately closed. just gotta find out why...
[03:19:35] <Slartibart> Cork: Sorry for my late answer. My design now is sort of modular, different modules(namespaces) for different parts of the application(different parts of the screen really). And then "glue logic" on top to route events between them etc. So the events can be more complex, like userClickedThisNowChangeListOfDataElsewhereAccordingly, or something. This way I feel communication between modules can be
[03:20:14] <Slartibart> decently efficient. I think it has worked well, when it's been about specific events. But like I said, wildcard event interception seems harder. Maintaining .on("event1.namespace1 event2.namespace1 event1.namespace2 event1.namespace2", function() {resetTimer();}); is no fun, methinks. Sure, at least often the events originate from some native event, usually something being clicked. Are you saying
[03:20:14] <Slartibart> I should redesign things and try to stick to native events?
[03:21:17] <Cork> Slartibart: like i said, yo don't need to bind each namespace
[03:21:28] <Cork> namespaces are for managing the event handlers, they don't isolate them
[03:21:54] <Cork> 'event1' will catch all of both 'event1.namespace1' and 'event1.namepsace2'
[03:26:46] <hellyeah> hey i want to avoid full page refresh because i dont want to regenerate dom over and over for this purpose i think to use setInterval method. DO i need to use ajax also?
[03:27:34] <Cork> hellyeah: what does setInterval have to do with your question?
[03:27:34] <hellyeah> related question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25446628/ajax-jquery-refresh-div-every-5-seconds
[03:27:53] <hellyeah> my page will be refreshed in one min
[03:28:04] <Cork> also you don't want to use setInterval if the code you run can take unknown amount of time
[03:28:09] <Cork> you always want to use setTimeout
[03:28:26] <hellyeah> humm
[03:28:32] <hellyeah> setTimeout okey
[03:28:54] <hellyeah> let me write smt with setTimeout
[03:35:18] <hellyeah> Cork:  i just want to reload table instead of full page am i in correct path? https://jsfiddle.net/3ssa5stm/3/
[03:35:49] <hellyeah> forgot to include jquery lib
[03:46:58] <Slartibart> Cork: Ok, I get that part. Now. I think. But how do I detect all events triggered by the application then? I'd like to avoid having to type each and every event possible, native or custom, and having to maintain it henceforth. On to wildcard event detection. I do not want to reset the timer for all events passing through .trigger(), like mouse events, zillions per seconds (or am I wrong there? Is .trigger() called at all
[03:46:58] <Slartibart>  except from the calls in my code? TIAS territory I guess.). So how do I filter them? I thought namespaces would be a good way of doing that.
[03:47:39] <Cork> Slartibart: you can't generically catch all
[03:47:48] <Cork> you have to explicitly listen for each event you want
[03:48:08] <Cork> trigger is only used to fake events, it isn't used for "real" events
[03:48:26] <Cork> only way to catch those is to explicitly bind them
[03:48:38] <hellyeah> should it open and close table in 3 secs what am i doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/3ssa5stm/8/
[03:49:17] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:49:33] <hellyeah> i need to try something else
[03:50:08] <Cork> Slartibart: also, you most likely don't want all events, cause there are a lot of them
[03:50:28] <Cork> what you most likely want is the events that indicate user activity
[03:50:51] <Uhkis> hellyeah: it does
[03:51:12] <Slartibart> Cork: In other words, an explicit list?
[03:51:17] <Cork> yes
[03:51:36] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  i didnt see tht table appear
[03:51:54] <Uhkis> hellyeah: works fine here, firefox 40.0.3
[03:51:54] <Cork> like i said, keyup and mousemove should get you a long way
[03:52:00] <Cork> you most likely don't need more
[03:52:08] <Cork> Slartibart: ^
[03:52:13] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  you saw the table
[03:52:15] <hellyeah> ?
[03:52:23] <Uhkis> hellyeah: yes
[03:52:28] <hellyeah> humm
[03:52:36] <Kartagis> any framework other than jqm that I can use to slide a page?
[03:52:42] <Cork> hellyeah: note that by how the code works double click will not show it
[03:52:45] <Kartagis> do you know of any?
[03:52:53] <hellyeah> chromium 45.0 i didnt see that
[03:53:08] <Varun_Krishna> Hi guys when appending table rows I want to remove the tr, and then append. http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/sv40ybhr/7/
[03:53:13] <Varun_Krishna> It is not working form e
[03:53:33] <Uhkis> hellyeah: works fine on that too
[03:53:52] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: what tr is it you want to remove?
[03:53:53] <hellyeah> did you click the button once?
[03:54:00] <Uhkis> yes
[03:54:18] <hellyeah> yeah
[03:54:20] <Cork> hellyeah: works fine here too
[03:54:21] <hellyeah> it worked sorry
[03:54:28] <Slartibart> Cork: Fair enough. Not what I was hoping for, of course :), but you've shown me some new ways of doing things which is equally good. I'll rewrite my handler. Thank you.
[03:57:08] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: all the tr's excepting this<tr><td>Sno</td><td>User Name</td></tr>
[03:57:16] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: What is wrong ?
[03:58:01] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: http://jsfiddle.net/sv40ybhr/8/
[03:58:13] <Cork> actually http://jsfiddle.net/sv40ybhr/9/
[03:58:36] <Cork> and a bit cleaned up html http://jsfiddle.net/sv40ybhr/10/
[04:00:09] <Uhkis> first thing i ever do to fiddles from here is "tidy up" even before i look at the code :-D
[04:00:11] <hellyeah> hey
[04:00:20] <Cork> ya, me too
[04:00:21] <hellyeah> in jquery is there a method button is clicked or not
[04:00:25] <Cork> i realoaded the page though :)
[04:00:50] <Cork> it is the main reason i prefer ppl to use jsfiddle
[04:00:58] <hellyeah> what do you think about this approach?
[04:01:01] <hellyeah> if(document.getElementById('button').clicked == true) {    alert("button was clicked"); }
[04:01:10] <Cork> i'm kinda done parsing ppls tag soup
[04:01:57] <Uhkis> jsfiddle also has nice and tidy UI compared to <any other here>
[04:03:14] <Varun_Krishna> Cork:  thank you so much.
[04:03:28] <Varun_Krishna> It will work for multiple values from ajax response too ?
[04:03:28] <hellyeah> hey
[04:03:33] <hellyeah> why it didnt work https://jsfiddle.net/3ssa5stm/15/
[04:03:47] <hellyeah> jsfiddle works for AJAX
[04:04:08] <hellyeah> you should write proper info to the url:
[04:04:25] <hellyeah> i think it must be /echo/?js or something
[04:04:51] <Varun_Krishna> hellyeah: Yes I think
[04:07:51] <hellyeah> anything?
[04:09:05] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: it works as long as the data in is a string of trs
[04:09:14] <Cork> it replaces everything in tbody
[04:09:31] <Cork> so it is clean and doesn't care about the input as long as it is valid data for tbody
[04:09:57] <Cork> and it doesn't have to take the header into account as it is in a separate thead
[04:11:22] <hellyeah> my example make sense?
[04:11:24] <hellyeah> ?
[04:11:41] <hellyeah> taplar yo
[04:11:53] <taplar> morning
[04:12:01] <hellyeah> howsit?
[04:12:24] <taplar> i'm on call, so fun week
[04:14:42] <hellyeah> i want to get an alert when button is clicked? What am i missing here? https://jsfiddle.net/3ssa5stm/17/
[04:14:55] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Yeah.
[04:16:02] <taplar> hellyeah: your executing that function not as part of a callback, but on it's own
[04:16:12] <taplar> also I don't believe a button has a 'clicked' element
[04:16:25] <hellyeah> humm
[04:16:47] <hellyeah> not as part of a callback, but on it's own what do you mean by that?
[04:16:57] <taplar> your just calling the function
[04:17:07] <taplar> instead of it being apart of the .on('click') handler
[04:17:13] <hellyeah> ic
[04:17:18] <guessx> hellyeah: put your alert in the buttonclass click function
[04:18:35] <hellyeah> actuallt guessx i want to check and report if button is not clicked i want to do something else i will just try something out
[04:19:06] <taplar> 'when' do you want to report?
[04:19:40] <hellyeah> actuallt i want to use localStorage
[04:19:49] <hellyeah> this example is convenient i am not sure
[04:20:01] <hellyeah> when you click button table pop up
[04:20:10] <hellyeah> page will be refreshed in one min
[04:20:23] <hellyeah> and page will appear with button and table
[04:20:40] <hellyeah> when you hit button again table will diseppear
[04:20:41] <taplar> why will it refresh?
[04:21:07] <hellyeah> in my original application, thread works in backend
[04:21:15] <hellyeah> new records come in one min.
[04:21:23] <hellyeah> i have to get up to date record
[04:21:40] <taplar> then get the new data with an ajax request, and replace the contents of your table
[04:21:51] <taplar> no need to reload the entire dom
[04:22:31] <hellyeah> yeah
[04:22:36] <hellyeah> this is what i try to do
[04:22:49] <hellyeah> i try to reach that point
[04:23:06] <hellyeah> i want to avoid "reload entire dom"
[04:23:13] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: If I use .html only one value is being displayed if I get many responses from json.
[04:23:23] <Varun_Krishna> but if I use append. the same value is appending
[04:23:24] <taplar> ok, so, do you have an endpoint yet that will return you up to date information yet?
[04:23:32] <Varun_Krishna> whenever I click on the button
[04:23:35] <guessx> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/cxt855z3/1/ change the if statement around
[04:24:21] <hellyeah> yes
[04:24:23] <hellyeah> taplar:
[04:24:27] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Ok fixed it.
[04:24:35] <Varun_Krishna> table.html("");
[04:24:37] <Varun_Krishna> :)
[04:24:41] <taplar> hellyeah: and it returns -just- the information?  not a complete webpage?
[04:24:56] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: if you want to replace the content don't use append
[04:25:00] <Cork> use .html
[04:25:20] <Cork> that was kinda why i changed it :)
[04:25:36] <newbie01> i dont want to return complete page
[04:25:53] <Varun_Krishna> there are multiple records from my json
[04:26:04] <Cork> ah
[04:26:12] <Varun_Krishna> so if I use html only one value is displayed instead of all ten
[04:26:13] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: best option is prob to build an array
[04:26:16] <Varun_Krishna> items
[04:26:18] <Cork> join them and add them in one go
[04:26:31] <taplar> right, i'm confirming that the endpoint you have only returns the data, not a complete webpage
[04:26:31] <Cork> appending in a loop is a performance killer
[04:26:44] <Cork> well appending to an element that is in the page
[04:27:18] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: O my God I didn't know appending from for loop will be slow
[04:27:32] <newbie01> taplar:  in my case i have a button and a table when table appears i want to reload table only  i dont want to reload button again and again
[04:27:40] <newbie01> taplar:  does it make sense?
[04:27:43] <taplar> Varun_Krishna: better to append to a fragment or push to an array, and append it all at the end
[04:27:50] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: var arr = []; arr.push(html-string); .html(arr.join(''))
[04:27:57] <Cork> the .html is after the loop
[04:28:35] <taplar> newbie01: i got that.  so if you do already have an endpoint to get just the up to date data, then you just need to call it with ajax
[04:28:58] <Varun_Krishna> Cork:  Ok got it
[04:29:02] <Varun_Krishna> Let me try it
[04:30:43] <Duikb00t> yoyo
[04:30:45] <Duikb00t> almost weekend.
[04:31:26] <hellyeah> taplar:  sec
[04:33:06] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Awesome Dude.
[04:33:15] <hellyeah> taplar:  did you mean this https://jsfiddle.net/cxt855z3/4/
[04:33:37] <hellyeah> i mean it made sense
[04:33:48] <taplar> something similar to that yes
[04:34:05] <hellyeah> actually i want to refresh the page i guess i should use load() method for that
[04:34:10] <taplar> why?
[04:34:37] <hellyeah> normally i am using meta equiv for refreshing the page
[04:34:51] <taplar> no, why are you refreshing the page
[04:34:54] <hellyeah> but that generate all dom again and again
[04:34:58] <hellyeah> hunm
[04:34:59] <hellyeah> well
[04:35:10] <hellyeah> my table is changing over time
[04:35:23] <hellyeah> i have 1000 threads work in one min and get new records from db
[04:35:37] <hellyeah> so my page have to show up do date records
[04:35:42] <taplar> i got that
[04:35:47] <hellyeah> thats why i want to refresh the page
[04:35:52] <taplar> but we said you could get it with ajax without a complete refresh
[04:35:57] <taplar> so why are you saying you need to refresh
[04:35:59] <hellyeah> okey
[04:36:04] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[04:36:09] <hellyeah> is it partial refresh?
[04:36:30] <taplar> 'reload <element>' is better
[04:36:38] <hellyeah> humm
[04:36:43] <taplar> 'refresh page' usually means the whole page, :)
[04:36:53] <hellyeah> reload element
[04:36:56] <hellyeah> okey
[04:36:58] <taplar> yep
[04:37:02] <taplar> so in this case, reload table
[04:37:15] <hellyeah> but i have like five elements in the table
[04:37:25] <hellyeah> do i need to reload everything
[04:37:34] <taplar> you just update what needs updating
[04:38:00] <hellyeah> ic
[04:38:39] <hellyeah> let me reload table
[04:39:35] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_loc_reload.asp
[04:40:00] <taplar> no, when i say reload, i mean that logically
[04:40:17] <taplar> you want to replace the contents of the table, or whatever, with the new contents
[04:40:46] <taplar> which can be done with html() or removing all the children and adding the new children, whatever
[04:41:44] <hellyeah> it seems kinda tough
[04:41:50] <taplar> nah
[04:41:59] <taplar> you got your response from your endpoint
[04:42:27] <taplar> if it's already in html format, you can just stick it in where ever with html().  otherwise, you construct your elements from the data and then you do it
[05:08:01] <paulvd> hello, i am trying to move the first li item down, and add class to the new first item in an ajax call, am using this in the success, jQuery(".deck ul").append( jQuery(".deck ul li.ondeck") ); jQuery(".deck ul li").first().addClass("ondeck"); but its not adding the class?
[05:08:43] <Cork> paulvd: why don't you just use prepend?
[05:09:15] <paulvd> Cork, I want to push the first item in the last, and add class to the new first item
[05:09:23] <paulvd> like a roundabout
[05:09:29] <Varun_Krishna> Hi guys why is it showing the same record more than once? http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/t6u3wbeu/
[05:09:59] <Cork> paulvd: then that should work
[05:10:04] <taplar> Varun_Krishna: your not resetting your string to blank
[05:10:10] <Cork> as long as .ondeck only exists on the first element that is
[05:10:30] <Cork> else you will just append them all to the end of the ul and nothing will change
[05:11:04] <Varun_Krishna> taplar: Line 58
[05:11:15] <Varun_Krishna> is doing it isn't it ???
[05:11:16] <taplar> that's outside the loop
[05:11:29] <paulvd> ok done
[05:11:37] <Success> Varun_Krishna, at the end of the loop, dont forget to reset htmlString
[05:11:41] <paulvd> i was not removing the class..:)
[05:12:05] <Varun_Krishna> taplar: genius
[05:12:09] <Varun_Krishna> solution.
[05:12:11] <Varun_Krishna> Thanks
[05:12:30] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: http://jsfiddle.net/t6u3wbeu/2/
[05:12:39] <taplar> btw, you could probably make that a little nicer if you did it as a map
[05:12:43] <Cork> no need for the htmlString variable
[05:13:02] <paulvd> kaha se hai be
[05:13:25] <taplar> err, not 'as a map', but with map()
[05:13:44] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Thank you
[05:13:50] <Varun_Krishna> taplar: thank you
[05:14:10] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: and as taplar said http://jsfiddle.net/t6u3wbeu/5/
[05:15:59] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: and fixed so it actually works http://jsfiddle.net/t6u3wbeu/6/ :)
[05:16:11] <BostonGeorge2k> why does this run two times? http://pastebin.com/zugZUrp9
[05:16:20] <BostonGeorge2k> i get two logs :/
[05:16:43] <Cork> BostonGeorge2k: most likely cause you have two elements matching .textWord_about
[05:19:00] <BostonGeorge2k> i dont, its weird .. seems like slideDown is caues the "re run"
[05:19:30] <Cork> BostonGeorge2k: console.log($('.textWord_about').length)
[05:19:59] <Cork> BostonGeorge2k: also never use attribute selectors without quotes around the value
[05:20:09] <Cork> $('.textWord_about[data-link=' + slide + ']') => $('.textWord_about[data-link="' + slide + '"]')
[05:23:38] <Varun_Krishna> Cork:
[05:23:44] <Varun_Krishna> Thank you dude.
[05:23:50] <Cork> np
[05:30:14] <BostonGeorge2k> is there a .not data-link selector?
[05:30:25] <BostonGeorge2k> i want to select all elements that dont have a certain data-link
[05:31:12] <taplar> $(selector).filter(function(){ return $(this).data('link') !== 'whatever'; });
[05:31:56] <BostonGeorge2k> thanks!
[05:40:29] <BostonGeorge2k> hm i cant get this thing going, basically i want to show different content on different links. the old content should be slided up and the new content slided down, thats the effect i am after http://jsfiddle.net/ta25o0ow/
[05:45:57] <Cork> BostonGeorge2k: http://jsfiddle.net/ta25o0ow/1/
[05:46:41] <Cork> or this might be what you want http://jsfiddle.net/ta25o0ow/2/
[05:47:35] <Cork> a better version of /2/ http://jsfiddle.net/ta25o0ow/3/
[05:47:59] <BostonGeorge2k> the first one was what i was looking for , awesome
[05:48:00] <BostonGeorge2k> thanks!
[05:48:25] <Cork> BostonGeorge2k: the reason things broke was cause you animated all of the textWord elements
[05:48:29] <Cork> so you got three callbacks
[05:49:07] <BostonGeorge2k> ahh! i understand
[05:49:25] <Cork> (this is what i hinted at at the start)
[05:50:39] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/ta25o0ow/4/
[05:51:58] <BostonGeorge2k> that works fine as well, i will def. study both version! thanks
[05:52:26] <taplar> that's the same as cork's first one, just caching the textword elements
[05:52:47] <Cork> ya, it's cleaned up all the repetitive selectors
[05:52:53] <Cork> was too lazy to do that ^^
[05:54:08] <hellyeah> taplar:  do you think this is useful for my purpose http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25446628/ajax-jquery-refresh-div-every-5-seconds
[05:54:46] <taplar> it's similar, but i'd probably use setTimeout instead of interval
[05:55:14] <hellyeah> yeah somone suggest me setInterval that is in my mind
[05:55:26] <taplar> also fwiw that setInterval has an unnecessary function wrapper
[05:55:32] <hellyeah> but i dont know the reason why you prefer setTimeout instead of setInteval
[05:55:44] <hellyeah> what does fwiw mean?
[05:55:48] <taplar> setInterval can be fine if your doing synchronous things
[05:55:59] <taplar> for what it's worth
[05:56:06] <Cork> also using setInterval like that is a really really bad idea
[05:56:15] <hellyeah> for async thing it is setTimeout
[05:56:29] <taplar> if your going to do a timed loop, yeah
[05:56:29] <hellyeah> Cork:  why is that?
[05:56:44] <Cork> hellyeah: think of this scenario: setInterval is set to call every 5 seconds
[05:56:53] <Cork> but the code takes 6 seconds to complete
[05:56:59] <hellyeah> humm
[05:57:01] <Cyberian> it may be bad practice but at the moment I use $.ajaxSetup({async: false/true}); before/after some $.get requests because I want to wait for them to return data. does ajaxSetup change not given parameters to default or are those settings kept until explicitly changed?
[05:57:14] <hellyeah> ic
[05:57:14] <Cork> then you will have 1 copy the first time, 2 compies the second time 4 copies the third and so on
[05:57:25] <Cork> setInterval doesn't care if the code completes or not
[05:57:34] <Cork> it just queues the function for execution
[05:57:46] <hellyeah> you can see incomplete page?
[05:57:49] <Cork> THAT is why you should always use setTimeout and do it from the .always callback
[05:57:51] <Cork> no
[05:57:58] <Cork> you will hit the server multiple times
[05:58:05] <hellyeah> ic
[05:58:05] <Cork> for each update
[05:58:15] <Cork> wasting cpu time and bandwidth
[05:58:22] <taplar> Cyberian: from the docs, it looks like that function changes the defaults
[05:58:26] <hellyeah> is this overhead issue?
[05:58:28] <Cyberian> erm, I revoke my question. Google Chrome's caching tricked me -.-
[05:58:39] <Cork> hellyeah: it is a load and race issue
[05:58:50] <taplar> also note the ending note from the docs, 'Set default values for future Ajax requests. Its use is not recommended.'
[05:58:55] <hellyeah> like race condition?
[05:59:21] <hellyeah> so the main idea is just loading spesific div thats all
[05:59:23] <Cork> hellyeah: no
[05:59:29] <hellyeah> ?
[05:59:36] <Cork> hellyeah: it is that is doesn't wait for the last execution to end
[05:59:43] <hellyeah> ic
[05:59:47] <Cork> so you get multiple code paths running directly after each other
[05:59:50] <Cork> so you get no dealy
[05:59:52] <Cork> *delay
[06:00:00] <d32d2> Hello everyone! I have a select form, one for the current year, month and day. I have it set to the current day using the date() function, and setting their values. Problem is, whenever I select another option ( which submits the form in my case ) it my jquery function changes the value back to the date of today which isn't wanted. Any way to get this fixed?
[06:00:03] <Cork> it just runs one after the other constantly
[06:00:09] <hellyeah> ic
[06:00:09] <d32d2> Perhaps create a function? And run it just if the page has just been loaded?
[06:00:18] <hellyeah> is it like loop?
[06:00:25] <Cork> hellyeah: and as network calls is by definition unknown how long it will take
[06:00:38] <Cork> setInterval for that is an really bad idea
[06:00:47] <Cork> hellyeah: no it binds the system tick event
[06:00:53] <Cork> and on each tick it calls the function
[06:00:57] <Cyberian> taplar, that's why I asked as the docs are a bit unclear there. But as I see it now the call only changes what is given as parameters.
[06:00:59] <Cork> but as js is single threaded
[06:01:00] <taplar> d32d2: a fiddle would be helpful
[06:01:07] <d32d2> On it's way taplar!
[06:01:07] <Cork> it will wait for the last code execution to end
[06:01:11] <d32d2> Sorry for being such a slouch XD
[06:01:12] <Cork> so it will build a queue
[06:01:25] <taplar> d32d2: np
[06:01:25] <Cork> completely killing the idea of a delay for the update
[06:01:31] <hellyeah> seems it fucked up memory
[06:02:05] <Cork> (and as not a single comment in so mentions this is why i say it is a really really bad source for coding js)
[06:02:08] <hellyeah> so setTimeout waits 5 sec for loading the page
[06:02:18] <hellyeah> no matter how long it takes
[06:02:25] <Cork> no setTimeout waits 5 seconds then call the function
[06:02:30] <Cork> no built in repetition
[06:02:32] <taplar> setTimeout will execute once, after a given delay
[06:02:51] <hellyeah> hmm my app works 7/24
[06:03:01] <Cork> also neither setInterval or setTimeout gives any guarantee for how long it will take for it to call
[06:03:01] <hellyeah> i have to load the page in every one min
[06:03:13] <Cork> it just guarantees it will not be before the timeout you gave
[06:03:20] <hellyeah> but setTimeout only works once
[06:03:20] <Cork> so 5s+ in this case
[06:03:21] <taplar> hellyeah: so upon completion of your request you would simply kick off another setTimeout
[06:03:29] <Cork> hellyeah: yes, but design
[06:03:37] <Cork> *by
[06:03:37] <hellyeah> or
[06:03:41] <hellyeah> infinite loop
[06:03:58] <hellyeah> using setTimeout inside for(;;)
[06:04:02] <taplar> no
[06:04:06] <Cork> hellyeah: $().load(url, function() { setTimeou(next, 5000); });
[06:04:14] <Cork> or actually
[06:04:23] <Cork> hellyeah: $().load(url).always(function() { setTimeou(next, 5000); });
[06:04:28] <taplar> ^ the second setTimeout goes in your done callback
[06:04:37] <Cork> always is better then done
[06:04:39] <d32d2> taplar, my dear helper in need, http://jsfiddle.net/Vcfhb/496/. This is what I currently use, on my webpage. It's not quite the same as the system on my website, but it would give you an idea. Jquery reassigns the value after the form has been submitted
[06:04:41] <taplar> or that
[06:05:15] <taplar> d32d2: right, as the page reloads
[06:05:36] <d32d2> onchange="this.form.submit()"
[06:05:38] <taplar> so when do you not want that to happen?
[06:05:47] <d32d2> When the user changes the date.
[06:05:55] <hellyeah> Cork:  i saw deferred.always() https://api.jquery.com/deferred.always/
[06:06:05] <Cork> that is what i used yes
[06:06:12] <taplar> simply changing the date should not cause that logic to re-execute, as you have shown it
[06:06:12] <d32d2> I show date based on the selected date, whenever the user wants to look up data from another date, ie sep 5th, the form should not be reassigned to today's date
[06:06:33] <hellyeah> ic
[06:06:35] <hellyeah> thanks
[06:06:37] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:06:40] <d32d2> Does the page not reload when I tell it to submit onchange()?
[06:06:44] <taplar> it will overlay any existing date on load
[06:06:54] <hellyeah> do i need to wrap it with $ajax Cork
[06:07:01] <Cork> no
[06:07:16] <taplar> so that was my question.  how do you differentiate between the first page load, and a load after the submit?
[06:07:27] <hellyeah> ic
[06:07:53] <d32d2> I don't. Damn :S
[06:07:55] <taplar> d32d2: if you do an original style form submit, the page reloads
[06:08:03] <hellyeah> Cork:  using this with localStorage is okey
[06:08:16] <d32d2> Indeed
[06:08:16] <hellyeah> i am kinda newbie
[06:08:30] <taplar> so you need to have some conditional to know when you don't want that to happen
[06:08:34] <hellyeah> i have some elements on the page when page loads i must be where i am at
[06:08:37] <d32d2> Whenever the user passes on a new date, I use it to run it trough a query, hence the submit.
[06:08:47] <d32d2> Whenever the date is changed, the query is ran, so it's pretty much always needed
[06:09:34] <Cork> hellyeah: actually .load doesn't support deferred i just noticed
[06:09:40] <Cork> so you will have to use $.ajax or $.get
[06:09:50] <Cork> and insert it into the page manually
[06:09:52] <taplar> the form should use the changed date for the submit.  but when the page returns, if your re-displaying what they just changed it to, the logic will overlay it
[06:10:03] <taplar> so it seems like your conditional is you only want to do that, if it does not already have a value
[06:10:20] <d32d2> Hmnn
[06:10:22] <hellyeah> Cork:  i will use "always" right
[06:10:33] <Cork> hellyeah: read what i just said
[06:10:37] <d32d2> If date does not equal today's date, do not change? Would that be doable? or not
[06:11:29] <hellyeah> ops sorry yes
[06:11:29] <taplar> on initial load, is the date set at all?
[06:11:52] <d32d2> on initial load, the date is set to today's date
[06:12:03] <taplar> before the logic runs
[06:12:08] <taplar> is it set at all?
[06:12:17] <d32d2> nope
[06:12:21] <taplar> so there ya go
[06:12:33] <taplar> if it's not set, default it, otherwise, leave it alone
[06:13:12] <d32d2> uhmm
[06:13:28] <voiter> is there a sophisticated plugin for tooltips that performs well on mobile and dekstop?
[06:13:28] <hellyeah> Cork:  i guess i can use $.AJAX
[06:13:37] <hellyeah> Cork:  ajax has url:..
[06:13:45] <placidb> I've been struggling with this for days and now hoping that somebody could shed some light on this for me. I inject some HTML and also remove it at some point. Before injection, a call to .parent() works fine. After removing the injected HTML, .parent() doesn't return an object (length == 0). The HTML content before and after are identical (I've diffed and md5summed them). I think my code is
[06:13:45] <placidb> a little too complex to set up a separate fiddle, but everything is testable at http://www.gebroedersniemeijer.staging.brigaid.nl/en/#product-range should anybody care to take a look.
[06:13:49] <Cork> hellyeah: no that is the old syntax
[06:13:52] <baako> anyone here use angular js please
[06:14:16] <Cork> hellyeah: the modern syntax is just $.ajax(url, { optional options }).done().always()
[06:14:27] <hellyeah> Cork:  i dont know much about ajax can you point me out to correct direction
[06:14:36] <Cork> ?api jquery.ajax
[06:14:36] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ajax(): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:14:46] <placidb> to be specific, the problem occurs when toggling the product details for the circle product images
[06:15:10] <taplar> placidb: if you remove() and element, it would no longer have a parent
[06:15:16] <hellyeah> dunno what options could be
[06:15:20] <hellyeah> i will take a look
[06:15:26] <Cork> hellyeah: for your case, none
[06:15:44] <hellyeah> none none
[06:15:51] <placidb> taplar: I'm not actually .remove()ing anything - I strip some code from .html() and then update it again using .html(code)
[06:16:01] <Cork> hellyeah: so just $.ajax(url).done(function(data) { $('target').html(data) }).always(function() { setTimeout() });
[06:16:18] <taplar> if you replace and element, it would also then not have a parent
[06:16:21] <taplar> and = an
[06:17:23] <placidb> taplar: so if I have some HTML, then manipulate it using .html() to inject some markup, and then strip the injected HTML again later, the original elements won't have a parent?
[06:17:54] <placidb> taplar: because after stripping, the entire document markup is identical to the unmanipulated markup.
[06:18:14] <taplar> if at any point you have a variable that references an element, say '.myClass', and then you replace the html for those elements, your variable that referenced those elements will no longer be connected to the dom
[06:18:29] <taplar> you will have to re-select them
[06:18:40] <placidb> taplar: I'm not re-using previously manipulated variables
[06:19:06] <placidb> taplar: I'm calling .parent() on a freshly selected element, which then fails where it previously returned an object
[06:19:15] <hellyeah> Cork:  i try to write smt just a sec
[06:19:23] <taplar> if you do .length instead of .parent() what do you get
[06:20:02] <placidb> taplar: the element on which I'm calling .parent() exists (length == 1). calling .parent() on it, returns no object (length == 0)
[06:20:33] <taplar> placidb: then a fiddle demonstrating the issue would be helpful, not a complete website
[06:21:17] <placidb> taplar: I understand. but time is very limited :/ - I was hoping that somebody would take a peek at the code as it is
[06:22:26] <placidb> just to be complete, the problematic code is located in http://www.gebroedersniemeijer.staging.brigaid.nl/js/niemeijer.js at line 132
[06:22:34] <hellyeah> Cork:  sorry if it make no sense? Does it seem good to go? https://jsfiddle.net/4bhrpgkz/
[06:23:40] <Cork> hellyeah: you missed closing the setTimeout call, but other then that, ya that is correct
[06:24:01] <hellyeah> let me check
[06:25:13] <taplar> placidb: so line 140 is your issue?
[06:26:00] <placidb> taplar: no actually 194 is
[06:26:56] <placidb> you will see it failing when you click on a thumbnail when product details are open
[06:27:26] <taplar> what does line 192 display?
[06:27:42] <placidb> Object { 0: <div.row.product-grid>, length: 1, prevObject: Object, context: <div.col-xs-12.col-sm-6.col-lg-4.product-item> }
[06:28:04] <hellyeah> Cork:  what is my mistake here https://jsfiddle.net/4bhrpgkz/7/
[06:28:07] <placidb> and then 194 displays: Object { length: 0, prevObject: Object, context: <div.col-xs-12.col-sm-6.col-lg-4.product-item> }
[06:28:20] <placidb> and .html() obviously fails
[06:28:24] <Cork> hellyeah: think a little, please...
[06:28:25] <taplar> that's strange
[06:28:36] <Cork> try to solve things your self
[06:29:37] <placidb> taplar: yes it almost gives me the impression that somehow the internal DOM tree of jQuery gets messed up somehow
[06:29:51] <placidb> so it can't find the .parent() .. but I'm not basing this on any evidence
[06:30:08] <taplar> well clicking the image works, but the link is the error
[06:30:12] <taplar> so that's something
[06:30:52] <placidb> what do you mean?
[06:31:10] <taplar> see the Batard?
[06:31:17] <placidb> yes
[06:31:40] <taplar> open your console, clear it, and click the image for Batard.  clear it again, click the "Batard" link
[06:32:30] <hellyeah> caplar sure
[06:32:32] <placidb> done that, but gives me the same behavior - .parent() still returns no object
[06:32:41] <placidb> are you seeing something different?
[06:32:42] <taplar> i don't get an error for clicking the image
[06:32:44] <taplar> only the link
[06:33:18] <placidb> well yes but the error occurs after having opened it
[06:33:32] <placidb> for me there is no error when I open an item for the first time
[06:33:53] <placidb> when I open another whereby triggering the code that strips the details-HTML, the .parent() call fails
[06:33:53] <taplar> how do i open one?
[06:34:18] <placidb> the idea is to expand product details upon clicking a thumbnail image (or link)
[06:34:39] <placidb> and then you should be able to click another, which automatically closes the previously opened details
[06:34:49] <taplar> ah, i see, it errors also when it closes
[06:34:51] <placidb> to open the details for the second item
[06:35:31] <placidb> I strip the markup for the details between the 'debug 1' and 'debug 2' console messages
[06:36:04] <placidb> which seems to work well - the markup is identical before/after injecting/stripping
[06:37:19] <taplar> do product-item belong to product-grid
[06:37:20] <placidb> so only after updating the parent html to remove the details, it seems to fail
[06:37:55] <placidb> yes .product-item is a direct child of .product-grid
[06:38:00] <taplar> that's your problem then
[06:38:03] <taplar> line 171
[06:38:14] <baako> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://prject.local:8000/test. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. it seems if you are usign xampp or VM as a backend and try to do a http get request to it, it doesnt seem to work
[06:38:27] <taplar> it no longer is relevant, as you replaced it on 162
[06:38:36] <placidb> taplar: but doesn't $(this) there refer to the .product-item that was clicked?
[06:38:54] <Cork> baako: and the question is?
[06:38:57] <taplar> yep, which you replaced
[06:39:20] <placidb> taplar: you mean by updating the grid HTML the reference to $(this) is lost?
[06:39:32] <baako> Cork, is this fixable via angular or via php which is serving the json i want to process
[06:39:32] <Cork> bakhtiya: the message is quite clear why things doesn't work
[06:39:44] <Cork> baako: it has to be handled server side
[06:39:48] <taplar> yes, you are going through every product grid and replacing it's html, which replaces all its children
[06:40:06] <taplar> so 'this' no longer references the current product-item in the dom
[06:40:18] <placidb> taplar: I understand.
[06:40:28] <placidb> thanks so much!
[06:40:48] <taplar> yup
[06:41:00] <placidb> so now I should find a way to keep reference somehow
[06:41:31] <NitroLiq> Quick question: does jQuery have a hangup in certain situations where it doesn't like classes with hyphens? I've got a little thing I've written using addClass() and it works fine with a one word class but if I had something like menu-scroll, it doesn't work
[06:42:42] <Cork> NitroLiq: nope- dashes works fine
[06:42:48] <Cork> ui uses it a lot for example
[06:42:54] <NitroLiq> weird
[06:43:24] <NitroLiq> check it out
[06:43:26] <NitroLiq> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rOedGy
[06:44:06] <NitroLiq> change the scroll class to something like menu-scroll in the css and jquery
[06:46:52] <baako> Cork, i tried in firefox and got response code 200 ok but then i got Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://prject.local:8000/test. (Reason: CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing).
[06:47:12] <Cork> baako: ya, have you set the header server side?

[06:48:38] <printForever> guys
[06:48:46] <printForever> can I add style something something
[06:48:57] <printForever> to an element that I previously insertAfter()
[06:48:58] <taplar_brb> ??
[06:49:05] <Cork> hellyeah: cause the server doesn't respond with anything
[06:49:06] <printForever> $('.counselling .list-wrapper').clone().insertAfter('p.vote');
[06:49:10] <baako> Cork, any ideas how to do it on chrome or firefox please
[06:49:25] <Cork> baako: you can't
[06:49:35] <printForever> I want to edit the stuff that I just cloned and placed after p.vote
[06:49:36] <Cork> like i've told you several times now, you have to fix it server side
[06:49:37] <printForever> in the same step
[06:49:51] <printForever> I need to assign width: 100%
[06:50:03] <baako> Cork, oh sorry lol got missed up
[06:50:05] <printForever> I'm just asking, can I use some callback or function in insertAfter
[06:50:12] <taplar_brb> printForever: you can do it before the insertAfter, but you may can do it after it
[06:50:13] <hellyeah> Cork:  i have target div
[06:50:28] <Cork> hellyeah: sure, you have $(target).html('')
[06:50:31] <printForever> taplar_brb: can you give me an example?
[06:50:38] <Cork> and ya that won't display anything of interest
[06:50:43] <printForever> taplar_brb: is it before clone? after clone?
[06:50:48] <taplar_brb> printForever: be wary of doing a lot in one statement though.  can degredate readability
[06:51:01] <printForever> just want to assign width 100%
[06:51:09] <taplar_brb> $(selector).clone().addClass(...).insertAfter(...)
[06:51:26] <printForever> addClass, but its not on the selector itself
[06:51:31] <printForever> its in the child element of the selector
[06:51:53] <shoky> printForever:  var clone = $().clone();   do whatever you want with clone
[06:51:53] <taplar_brb> let me check something
[06:52:04] <taplar_brb> ^ really breaking it up is the way to go
[06:52:10] <DarioLap> Hi all. I have a change event that calls ajax request. If this change event is called many times in few seconds, how i prevent multiple change and perform ajax call only after the last?
[06:52:19] <printForever> $(selector).clone().css( $('subselect') function () { style: width 100% }.insertAfter()
[06:52:32] <printForever> taplar_brb: is this good?
[06:52:37] <shoky> printForever: that's wrong, and even if it wasn't, it's gross. just forget it. it's bad
[06:52:39] <hellyeah> Cork:  https://jsfiddle.net/4bhrpgkz/13/
[06:52:59] <shoky> printForever:  var clone = $().clone();  clone.find('.subselect').addClass(...);   clone.insertAfter(..)
[06:53:01] <Cork> uh...
[06:53:02] <taplar_brb> you might try $(selector).clone().insertAfter(...).find(childSelector).css(...)
[06:53:10] <printForever> shoky: whats your idea?
[06:53:16] <shoky> printForever:  var clone = $().clone();  clone.find('.subselect').addClass(...);   clone.insertAfter(..)
[06:53:22] <Cork> hellyeah: when i told you to think a bit on you're own it didn't mean every thing was fine...
[06:53:35] <printForever> taplar_brb: so after insertAfter to find a child and assign css
[06:53:36] <Cork> hellyeah: it mean the error is simple enough that you should be able to see it your self
[06:53:41] <printForever> shoky, thats a nice example
[06:53:44] <hellyeah> Cork:  thank you
[06:53:49] <Cork> O_o
[06:53:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:53:57] <taplar_brb> printForever: insertAfter returns a jQuery object, so it should be the element that was inserted
[06:54:09] <hellyeah> what does O_o mean?
[06:54:22] <shoky> if you really want to keep chaining stuff you can also do  .find(...).addClass(...).end().insertAfter(...)
[06:54:30] <shoky> but then you suck.
[06:54:30] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/4bhrpgkz/14/ does line 6 really look ok to you?
[06:54:35] <taplar_brb> lol
[06:54:49] <printForever> shoky I will go with taplar_brb idea
[06:55:25] <shoky> printForever: taplar's idea was also to break it up
[06:55:31] <shoky>  <taplar_brb> ^ really breaking it up is the way to go
[06:55:31] <shoky> :)
[06:55:34] <taplar> i would recommend that
[06:55:58] <hellyeah> Cork:  is there a problem here i dont see i closed setTimeout
[06:56:18] <Cork> func(art1), arg2 looks fine?
[06:56:22] <Cork> really?
[06:56:58] <NitroLiq> So, it works also if I camelCase the class. hyphen seems to break it. Makes no sense. It's a string.
[06:57:10] <hellyeah> i need fresh air
[06:57:11] <Cork> hellyeah: i'm trying to get you to use your own head, that is why i'm not giving you the answer
[06:57:25] <hellyeah> Cork:  i realize it
[06:57:48] <Cork> btw meant func(arg1), arg2
[06:57:51] <hellyeah> Cork:  does it seem correct? https://jsfiddle.net/4bhrpgkz/15/
[06:58:03] <Cork> yup
[06:58:28] <Cork> except you removed the use of .always
[06:58:38] <Cork> so if the call fails the timer will die
[06:58:59] <hellyeah> okey always will guarantee it will work contantly
[06:59:20] <printForever> thank you shoky and thank you taplar_brb
[06:59:36] <placidb> taplar: the only thing I don't understand is that $(this) (which would have lost its reference), still returns an object
[06:59:38] <taplar> 'always' always happens, regardless of success or failure
[06:59:43] <DarioLap>  Hi all. I have a change event that calls ajax request. If this change event is called many times in few seconds, how i prevent multiple change and perform ajax call only after the last?
[06:59:59] <taplar> placidb: it's still in memory, replacing the dom doesn't wipe out a javascript variable
[07:00:23] <placidb> taplar: I understand.
[07:00:36] <hellyeah> Cork:  https://jsfiddle.net/4bhrpgkz/18/
[07:00:45] <shoky> DarioLap: you're looking for "debounce" functionality. there's lots of plugins you can use that do it
[07:01:06] <Cork> hellyeah: the indenting is weird, but ya that is correct
[07:01:27] <shoky> DarioLap: underscore/lodash for example has _.debounce
[07:01:43] <Cork> hellyeah: though for the updating you want to have a function you recursively call
[07:02:10] <hellyeah> i can tidy up
[07:02:20] <DarioLap> Thanks shoky, now i try!
[07:02:31] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/4bhrpgkz/19/
[07:02:49] <hellyeah> Cork:  or infinite loop?
[07:03:30] <Cork> hellyeah: no, you never want to use loops when things are async https://jsfiddle.net/4bhrpgkz/20/
[07:03:37] <placidb> taplar: awesome, it works now. thanks again!
[07:03:49] <Ugolin> does someone know if there is a backbone IRC ? anf if yes where ?

[07:04:11] <Cork> opps missed you hid the field https://jsfiddle.net/4bhrpgkz/21/
[07:04:52] <shoky> Ugolin  #documentcloud
[07:05:53] <hellyeah> Cork:  why is that?
[07:06:19] <Cork> hellyeah: cause 1. loops are sync so they will hang the browser
[07:06:27] <hellyeah> ic
[07:06:32] <Cork> 2. as they are sync they will fire all the timers at once
[07:06:40] <Cork> and then you won't have the one at a time effect
[07:06:47] <Cork> so ya, loops are pointless
[07:06:59] <hellyeah> content is not visible
[07:07:05] <Ugolin> shoky: thanks
[07:07:12] <Cork> actually you never want to use loops to delay anything in js
[07:07:27] <Cork> cause that will just fail
[07:07:41] <hellyeah> ic
[07:08:03] <hellyeah> never for "for" loops?
[07:08:18] <Cork> never do any form of loops to delay an action
[07:08:25] <Cork> no matter the type
[07:08:47] <hellyeah> ah okey
[07:08:47] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: How do I check if a node exists in json response ?
[07:08:56] <Varun_Krishna> data.nodename != "" ?
[07:08:56] <Cork> cause for as long as you keep the js stack occupied you will prevent the browser from updating the page
[07:09:11] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: data.nodename == undefined
[07:09:43] <Cork> or !== undefined if you want the other way around
[07:09:44] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Yes now I see to be more specific typeof data.nodename == undefined.
[07:09:51] <Varun_Krishna> :)
[07:10:01] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: no typeof isn't what you want here
[07:10:13] <Cork> it is only needed for variable names
[07:10:32] <Cork> typeof(ariableNotDefined) === "undefined"
[07:10:54] <Cork> for properties it is cleaner to just write data.property !== undefined
[07:14:37] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: not working
[07:15:18] <Cork> js> var data = {}; if(data.noting === undefined) { print('not here'); } else { print('found') }
[07:15:23] <b-ot> Cork: not here
[07:16:10] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: what if I assign data.node to some variable and check if it is undefined ?
[07:16:37] <Cork> you mean like...
[07:16:51] <Cork> js> var data = {}; var b = data.nothing; if(b === undefined) { print('not here'); } else { print('found') }
[07:16:52] <Varun_Krishna> now if I see on chrome debugger I can see that data node has some error message and .node name is undefined
[07:16:57] <b-ot> Cork: not here
[07:17:14] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: typeof is only needed when the variable might be undefined
[07:17:19] <DarioLap> shoky, thanks, it works!
[07:17:21] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: b-ot he means you are coding here
[07:17:28] <Cork> notice that undefined, and have the value undefined isn't the same thing
[07:17:32] <shoky> np DarioLap
[07:17:51] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: b-ot is a bot, it just outputs the result
[07:18:05] <Varun_Krishna> O_0
[07:18:14] <Cork> the result is meant to be the prof that it works
[07:18:24] <Cork> notice the difference to
[07:18:30] <Cork> js> if(b === undefined) { print('not here'); } else { print('found') }
[07:18:34] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[07:18:35] <jungeeeee> how to clear the content of a div element?
[07:18:39] <Cork> it will crash
[07:18:42] <jungeeeee> remove() is removing the element right?
[07:18:43] <Varun_Krishna> but for me that data value is coming from server response
[07:18:51] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: doesn't matter
[07:18:53] <Varun_Krishna> jungeeeee: Set a class to that div
[07:18:58] <shoky> jungeeeee: .empty()
[07:19:01] <jungeeeee> empty
[07:19:01] <Varun_Krishna> $(".selector").html("");
[07:19:02] <jungeeeee> yes
[07:19:14] <Cork> .empty() is the correct choice
[07:19:21] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: oh
[07:21:53] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: If I alert(data.node) it shows undefined
[07:22:22] <Varun_Krishna> but where as if I check if(data.node != undefined){} even when it is undefined it is going into if condition
[07:25:02] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: never ever use alert for debugging
[07:25:35] <Varun_Krishna> Ok
[07:25:44] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: is node defined or just "empty"?
[07:25:53] <Cork> meaning what is it set to in the json
[07:26:16] <hexsole> http://www.classiclandscapes.com/Classic_Code/login.html
[07:26:24] <Varun_Krishna> when if there is an error this is what I get {message: "Something went wrong.Please try later }
[07:26:28] <hexsole> can someone have a look at this please
[07:26:35] <Varun_Krishna> when the request is successful I will have all the data.
[07:26:37] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: actually paste the json into a jsfiddle, makes it easier to explain
[07:26:46] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Ok
[07:31:27] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/30z35w78/
[07:31:49] <Varun_Krishna> when it is successful I will get all the values like that one. else I will only get message something went wrong
[07:35:33] <taplar_afc> really you should have a fail or error handler for that case
[07:35:57] <hellyeah> Cork:  can i as last question why it didnt count up https://jsfiddle.net/4bhrpgkz/33/
[07:39:55] <FilipNortic> is the any good reason why you should delaged event as short "distance" as possible?
[07:40:06] <FilipNortic> delegate*
[07:40:07] <BostonGeorge2k> Cork, thanks again your code: http://jsfiddle.net/ta25o0ow/1/ - I would like to add a feature: if one box is opened and gets clicked again it should only be closed. Do you have any idea?
[07:41:31] <taplar_afc> FilipNortic: the greater the scope of a delegate, the more events it has to filter through
[07:42:15] <taplar_afc> FilipNortic: for instance, if you delegate listen for click events for a div on the body, all click events any where will be evaluated against the delegate before being ignored
[07:43:05] <taplar_afc> thus reducing the delegate scope as much as possible removes unnecessary processing
[07:45:01] <FilipNortic> taplar_afc: Ahh, that make sense thx
[07:45:09] <taplar_afc> and there's another which deals with side effects
[07:45:21] <taplar_afc> say for instance you bind on the body for a click event of element b
[07:45:27] <taplar_afc> b is a child of element a
[07:45:40] <taplar_afc> given certain cases you want to cancel the event before it bubbles up to element a
[07:45:50] <taplar_afc> if you delegate bind too high, that's not possible
[07:46:00] <taplar_afc> by the time it has reached the body, it's already bubbled through a
[07:46:57] <Xatenev> hellyeah: u solved ur problem?

[08:57:16] <skullcrasher> can I use jquery.ajax() and make a file downloadable?
[08:57:59] <skullcrasher> the thin is that the ajax request sends form data to the backend, that generates an pdf (octet-stream) as response.
[08:59:41] <skullcrasher> But how can I get a prompt or something for the user to accept the file download
[08:59:59] <skullcrasher> just so that it looks like a normal download link behavior
[09:00:57] <duch_kazatel> you need to respond with the correct mime-type for the download
[09:02:58] <skullcrasher> duch_kazatel, what do you mean?
[09:03:52] <duch_kazatel> getting a download prompt is controlled by the response from the server, not ajax.
[09:12:09] <BostonGeorge2k> filter
[09:19:04] <taplar_afc> mmm, duch_kazatel, hiding from people who don't know who you are? :P
[09:21:57] <duch_kazatel> haha
[09:22:00] <duch_kazatel> sort of?
[09:27:31] <django_> hey all
[09:27:32] <django_> for this
[09:27:35] <django_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/nPoviTXf/
[09:27:46] <django_> how does the scope.$apply(check); work
[09:27:59] <duch_kazatel> that's not jqeury.
[09:28:01] <duch_kazatel> looks like angular.
[09:29:58] <macskay> hey guys, i got a question regarding popover's in bootstrap. i want to generate popovers dynamically. I therefore build up multiple popover_content_<id> divs which are all hidden by default. when clicking on one popover button the respective content should load up. This is my .js: https://www.refheap.com/109682 The popover gets called, but the content of the popover seems not to be right. Why is that? Here's an
[09:29:58] <macskay>  example of the hidden div: https://www.refheap.com/109683 Thanks for the help in advance
[09:30:21] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle instead, macskay
[09:33:24] <macskay> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/m0mhyu5c/
[09:37:37] <CrowX-> I have an element to which I dynamically add data using jquery's append function. The data is taken from an ajax call, so it has to be dynamic.
[09:37:43] <CrowX-> When I add the data, the height of the element gets increased, obviously.
[09:37:50] <CrowX->  How can I make the increasing of the height of the element smooth, i.e. with some transition-like effect?
[09:38:53] <duch_kazatel> macskay sorry - are you not able to make a functiooning example?
[09:39:40] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- probably?  you'd have to render that content elsewhere and then move it into place while animating the height.
[09:39:45] <duch_kazatel> i'd probably avoid doing that though.
[09:40:31] <mazpe> i have a table that has an .clickable-row class in each row... I'm trying to trigger a modal, how can i do stop the (".clickable-row").click() so that i can trigger modal?
[09:40:50] <duch_kazatel> preventDefault()
[09:41:50] <NitroLiq> Can someone help me  sort out swapping classes based on window width? Window width is fine but am having trouble with the toggle working properly. Or the logic
[09:41:53] <NitroLiq> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rOedGy
[09:42:04] <duch_kazatel> what do the classes do?
[09:42:10] <duch_kazatel> add/remove styles?
[09:42:45] <NitroLiq> they adjust the size of the dropdown menu
[09:42:53] <duch_kazatel> then use media queries :)
[09:43:14] <NitroLiq> so I have small by default, then at 640px want to removeClass small and addClass mega
[09:43:14] <taplar_afc> also looks like your doing toggle class if it's less than a value
[09:43:29] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you want media queries.
[09:43:30] <NitroLiq> these are foundation classes
[09:43:30] <taplar_afc> if it adjusts multiple times under that value it will flip on off on off on off
[09:43:33] <duch_kazatel> that's what they're for.
[09:44:51] <DeltaHeavy_> Sorry D/C'd there
[09:45:45] <DeltaHeavy> But yeah, if you're a front end developer, using Bootstrap besides for maybe it's grid system isn't a great idea IMO. Kind of looks like a crutch.
[09:45:55] <duch_kazatel> wut
[09:46:37] <mazpe> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/7Lv0q2jc/
[09:46:47] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know if this is a better way to convert a string that represents a function reference? https://www.refheap.com/b78376bbb4d084a2658645ce0
[09:47:42] <mazpe> preventDefault() doesnt seem stop the url redirection from clickable class that is on the <tr>
[09:48:16] <duch_kazatel> mazpe you need to pass in the event object and call it against that.
[09:48:24] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery preventdefault
[09:48:24] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: event.preventDefault() | jQuery API Documentation ‚Üí http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/
[09:48:54] <duch_kazatel> also, $(".foo") won't select that <a> tag.
[09:49:07] <duch_kazatel> a tag has an id, .foo selects a class.
[09:49:44] <NitroLiq> Under normal circumstances, I would use MQs but these are foundation classes set in the JS. This is why I'm simply trying to swap (toggle) the classes at 640
[09:49:53] <mazpe> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/7Lv0q2jc/1/
[09:49:56] <mazpe> duch_kazatel: same thing though
[09:50:21] <duch_kazatel> mazpe are you trying to prevent navigating to the URL or prevent the window.open()?
[09:50:40] <mazpe> duch_kazatel: prevent the window.open()
[09:50:54] <mazpe> duch_kazatel: eventually the to open a modal.
[09:51:24] <duch_kazatel> mazpe oh, you need to stopPropagation()
[09:52:56] <mazpe> duch_kazatel: yes!
[09:54:11] <noahmg123> my jquery ajax request will not run when attached to an onchange of an input element
[09:54:50] <duch_kazatel> will a console log run?
[09:54:58] <taplar_afc> NitroLiq: what i was saying is your doing to logic on window resize and it is toggling the class whenever the size is less than 840.  so if the window size is changed from 841->840->839->838, it will fire 4 times, resulting in the class still being on the object(s)
[09:55:36] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: was that to me?
[09:55:36] <NitroLiq> ah ok
[09:55:41] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 yep.
[09:56:01] <taplar_afc> also, it's not taking into consideration if they resize it so that it goes from above, to below, and then above again
[09:56:01] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 check to make sure the event handler fires.
[09:56:34] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: it works when I run the function straight in the console. How do I make sure the event handler fires?
[09:56:47] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 by using a console.log or debugger statement.
[10:00:09] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: ok. it is not firing for some reason until I switch the devtools window into focus
[10:00:17] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:00:48] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: if I click somewhere inside the devtools
[10:01:01] <duch_kazatel> can you share an example of your code?
[10:01:05] <duch_kazatel> something doesn't seem right here.
[10:01:06] <NitroLiq> Is this any better? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rOedGy Functionality-wise, it's doing what I want it to do.
[10:01:29] <duch_kazatel> don't do $(window) in resize handlers.
[10:01:35] <duch_kazatel> same with
[10:01:36] <duch_kazatel> $('#users'
[10:01:52] <duch_kazatel> basically, don't ever select anything in the handler - do it before, outside, and reference the variable instead.
[10:03:11] <duch_kazatel> and throttle/debounce the handler, too.
[10:03:48] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/Fvc1WRHG
[10:04:15] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 where's the binding?
[10:04:41] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: the element with the id something?
[10:05:26] <duch_kazatel> noahmg12 right, but are you binding before it exists?  is that element getting written after pageload?
[10:05:29] <duch_kazatel> like.. i need more info.
[10:05:38] <duch_kazatel> you said the function works fine, and then gave me the function.
[10:05:46] <duch_kazatel> so it's the binding that's causing an issue.
[10:05:53] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: ok. the element is there on page load.
[10:06:02] <duch_kazatel> is your js in the <head>?
[10:06:08] <noahmg123> noahmg123: yes
[10:06:15] <NitroLiq> can you point me to an example or article demonstrating that?
[10:06:17] <duch_kazatel> and is it in a document ready?
[10:06:34] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq which part?
[10:06:49] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: Sould be. I change the text in input and then click the dev tools, and it works
[10:07:00] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 you need to confirm.
[10:07:22] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq http://codepen.io/anon/pen/avNPWR for the vars
[10:07:35] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq do you have underscore installed?
[10:07:57] <NitroLiq> no
[10:08:12] <duch_kazatel> there's http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[10:08:19] <duch_kazatel> but plenty of other examples available that aren't plugins.
[10:08:26] <NitroLiq> Im basically prototyping stuff and handing off to a backend team putting all this into drupal
[10:08:45] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: I put it in the (document).ready function and it still works the wa I just described.
[10:08:55] <NitroLiq> Ill read up on it thanks
[10:09:08] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 no clue then.  something isn't adding up.
[10:09:13] <duch_kazatel> make sure your selectors are good.
[10:09:46] <NitroLiq> Curious though, why create vars for those pieces rather than reference directly?
[10:09:49] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: they are. I checked. Also, otherwise, it should not work at all.
[10:10:04] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq $() is expensive.
[10:10:27] <duch_kazatel> you're spinning off new objects each time which consumes CPU and Memory, especially in cases where they can fire dozens of times a second.
[10:10:35] <taplar_afc> DRY
[10:10:41] <NitroLiq> right
[10:10:59] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq so use variables instead - much much faster.  also cleaner code anyway - variables are good.
[10:10:59] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: I am in wordpress if that means anything.
[10:11:09] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 js doesn't care about your backend.
[10:11:42] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: Yeah. This guy had a similar issue: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpress-ajax-onchange-event-help I am reading it wight now.
[10:11:51] <duch_kazatel> hold up.
[10:12:00] <duch_kazatel> are you doing things yourself or using a plugin?
[10:12:33] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: I tried both actually.
[10:12:38] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle then.
[10:12:41] <duch_kazatel> show me the basics
[10:12:55] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: ok, just a moment
[10:23:57] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: doing work stuff. the fiddle may be a bit delayed.

[10:33:23] <Jeevsxp> Hey all, I was experimenting with combining bits of HTML in my code and adding them to the dom: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=uEoAjJRbgz
[10:33:50] <Jeevsxp> This method doesn't seem to be officially supported, but it works
[10:34:03] <duch_kazatel> not doing what you think it's doing.
[10:34:21] <duch_kazatel> oh wait hah, yes it is - https://api.jquery.com/add/
[10:34:32] <duch_kazatel> i'd still probably avoid it, but novel.
[10:35:07] <Jeevsxp> well what this doesn't show is I need to add data to each fragment
[10:35:32] <Jeevsxp> my other options are adding them to the dom individually, not ideal
[10:35:43] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:36:52] <Jeevsxp> or using  a wrapper and having there be a pointless element
[10:36:54] <Jeevsxp> ???
[10:37:02] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:37:06] <duch_kazatel> those aren't your only options.
[10:37:17] <Jeevsxp> pray tell?
[10:37:19] <duch_kazatel> there's a cleaner way here.
[10:37:21] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[10:40:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9rkbqukt/1/
[10:40:45] <duch_kazatel> slightly similar, but a bit cleaner IMO.
[10:41:17] <taplar_afc> nice, i thought you were going to do a document.createFragment
[10:41:20] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:41:24] <duch_kazatel> $() does that for you ;)
[10:41:29] <taplar_afc> yup
[10:41:32] <duch_kazatel> you were basically already creating a "useless element"
[10:43:23] <esaym153> for performance reasons, isn't this this fastest way to update a bunch of random elements under a parent element: http://pastie.org/private/srot2esta4teba6ygenbxq basically selecting the partent element save to a var and pass that var around. That way jquery doesn't have to search the whole page everytime?
[10:43:38] <duch_kazatel> almost.
[10:43:44] <duch_kazatel> $(js) is defeating the point htough.
[10:43:46] <duch_kazatel> *though
[10:43:50] <duch_kazatel> just use jq
[10:43:59] <duch_kazatel> so jq.find('.row1').text('something');
[10:44:07] <duch_kazatel> but there's an even faster way
[10:45:11] <Jeevsxp> thx dutch
[10:45:15] <duch_kazatel> *duch ;)
[10:45:32] <Jeevsxp> oh sorry, duch
[10:46:41] <esaym153> duch_kazatel: ah, yea
[10:47:33] <Jeevsxp> wait this is nice but it means you have to find where to put the parent element on the page again doesn't it?
[10:47:37] <duch_kazatel> esaym153 the fastest way is to detach() that element and operate against that version, then reappend the whole mess.
[10:48:10] <duch_kazatel> Jeevsxp you can .clone() the element and operate against the clone instead, then .replace() it.
[10:48:27] <duch_kazatel> Jeevsxp if you're really worried about performance (and you shouldn't be most of the time), that's the "fastest" way.
[10:48:29] <esaym153> duch_kazatel: yea, I think I remember something about using detach
[10:48:58] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/detach-elements-before-work-with-them/
[10:49:12] <Jeevsxp> In your example you have just appended it to the bottom of body, the replace idea seems like it might be better
[10:49:31] <duch_kazatel> Jeevsxp not necessarily.  you should know where the element exists.
[10:49:52] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: I'm back. Here you go: http://ubuntu-nmggithub.c9.io/test/test.html
[10:49:59] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 O.o
[10:50:18] <duch_kazatel> this does not have a function binding in it.
[10:50:27] <duch_kazatel> <input name="blah" onchange="mainInfo();" noooo
[10:50:52] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: did something wrong?
[10:51:08] <duch_kazatel> si.
[10:51:17] <duch_kazatel> don't use onchange.
[10:51:40] <noahmg123> I was gonna say que es wronga but you answered mi pregunta. :)
[10:53:09] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 so first off, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0k1omvxn/1/
[10:53:45] <duch_kazatel> make sure you kill the onchange
[10:53:50] <duch_kazatel> and $('input').change(function mainInfo() { is wrong.
[10:54:02] <duch_kazatel> $('input').change(function() { if you want to inline it, otherwise check out my example.
[10:56:15] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: OK. I see. I sitll have the problem but now I see what is really happening. The element is not changed until I leave focus of the input. Is this normal?
[10:56:26] <duch_kazatel> that's the "change" event.
[10:56:30] <duch_kazatel> you probably want input
[10:56:57] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: ok
[10:57:28] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: yay! it works!
[10:58:08] <duch_kazatel> that's a little excessive btw.
[10:58:14] <duch_kazatel> be careful with setups like that.
[10:59:49] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: what was excessive about it?
[11:01:43] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 it's going to do an ajax request for every keystroke.
[11:01:45] <duch_kazatel> for every user.
[11:01:57] <duch_kazatel> might consider only allowing things over, say, 3 chars and debouncing.
[11:02:23] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: yeah, but I am making a one-page search application. Is there something else I can use?
[11:02:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:03:31] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: I am going to use this to create an application that creates a lift of items based on what the user types
[11:03:38] <noahmg123> list*
[11:05:35] <EJFJCorp> Hello, I found a big bug : JQuery.DOMelementSelectors.slice(3,end) is possible only when end is a number, when undefined the script closes without any notice...
[11:07:24] <EJFJCorp> Please consider undefined param as empty, the first need to be a number, so consider .slice() is equal .slice(1) and .slice(3,) or .slice(8,emptyvar) or .slice(6,undefined) should be trated as without the second parameter...
[11:09:36] <EJFJCorp> Another big bug is that when we put a big number, it causes a crash of the script, the maximum end should be the last item 0 based index
[11:10:11] <Jeevsxp> @duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=uEoAjJRbgz
[11:10:20] <EJFJCorp> so in a set of 10 elements, .slice(9,99999999) means the 2 last elements
[11:10:41] <esaym153> ugh, anyone familiar with jqGrid? I basically need to update some column header names with extra text depending on what was selected from another part of the ui. The grid is reloaded with with the standard 'mygrid.addJSONData(myjsongrid)' way, but that doesn't touch the headers
[11:11:05] <esaym153> of course I can just use a jquery selector on the head class, but that seems wrong...
[11:11:06] <EJFJCorp> Please correct this, this is an official EJFJ Corporation SSP request, it will be much easier for all users of the  .slice() function
[11:11:08] <duch_kazatel> EJFJCorp make a fiddle.
[11:11:35] <duch_kazatel> Jeevsxp i have a hard time believing this is your actual markup.
[11:11:51] <Uhkis> oh noes, the infamous duch_kazatel is back
[11:11:51] <Jeevsxp> How so?
[11:12:02] <duch_kazatel> EJFJCorp if you want to submit a bug, please submit it at github.
[11:12:16] <EJFJCorp> github???
[11:12:19] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[11:12:34] <EJFJCorp> I do not have time to loose, no human being should use time...
[11:12:44] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:12:50] <duch_kazatel> EJFJCorp this isn't even the development channel for jquery.
[11:12:57] <duch_kazatel> bugs should be reported to the github repo.
[11:13:02] <Uhkis> time is pretty constant, hard to loosen it
[11:13:09] <Uhkis> EJFJCorp: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues
[11:13:55] <EJFJCorp> Thank you...

[11:14:32] <duch_kazatel> also, it's not really the library's fault if you're passing the wrong types to a method.
[11:14:44] <duch_kazatel> the method takes two args, both are numbers.  the docs are pretty clear.
[11:15:53] <duch_kazatel> Jeevsxp that just strikes me as a little odd.  how many elements are you going to be adding in your case, anyway?
[11:15:58] <duch_kazatel> and do you have a templating engine at play?
[11:16:23] <Jeevsxp> upto 50 maybe and no templating engine
[11:16:40] <duch_kazatel> depending on complexity of each element, 50 really is not big deal.
[11:16:46] <Jeevsxp> but the markup is oonly representative of what I have
[11:16:47] <duch_kazatel> don't worry much about performance in that case.
[11:16:58] <duch_kazatel> wait until it's an issue - go with readability first.
[11:17:05] <Synthead> is there a way I can add button like the "close" button in a jQuery UI dialog?  I want to put an "edit" button next to it.
[11:17:40] <Jeevsxp> I have to refresh this every second or so, but I'm not too worried about perf, just have elems in my target to begin with
[11:17:53] <ngharo> Synthead: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-buttons
[11:17:56] <Jeevsxp> plus it will be difficult to reinsert once removed
[11:18:08] <bosnian> looking for a job in Germany... anyone here with such opportunities? thanks!
[11:18:08] <duch_kazatel> Jeevsxp woah.
[11:18:14] <Jeevsxp> so I'm liking the replaceWith()
[11:18:17] <duch_kazatel> bosnian not the right place to look :)
[11:18:27] <duch_kazatel> Jeevsxp once every second might cause some headaches.
[11:18:29] <Synthead> ngharo: I don't want a button in the modal, but in the title bar like the "close" button
[11:18:36] <duch_kazatel> might not though - make sure you use recursive timeouts :()
[11:18:37] <bosnian> duch_kazatel I figured... where should I? opened for all recommendations
[11:18:44] <duch_kazatel> bosnian not here?
[11:18:55] <duch_kazatel> not aware of any job board chats on freenode.
[11:19:00] <bosnian> duch_kazatel I figured
[11:19:08] <bosnian> I'm open for all recommendations
[11:19:25] <duch_kazatel> maybe ##freelance?
[11:20:01] <Synthead> duch_kazatel: oh interesting!  I didn't know that existed
[11:20:05] <ngharo> Synthead: ahh, not that i know of.  Maybe you could do some fancy css 'content' class
[11:20:18] <bosnian> ended up in an empty -- ##freelance? -- channel... thanks duch leaving to ##freelance
[11:20:22] <Synthead> ngharo: that's kind of what I was thinking :)  ok, thanks!
[11:20:46] <Synthead> bosnian: it's #freelance ;)
[11:20:48] <duch_kazatel> Synthead or append something using js.  might want to roll a different dialog at that point.
[11:20:52] <duch_kazatel> or #freeland, whatevs ;)
[11:21:04] <duch_kazatel> should be ## , not sure why it isn't.
[11:21:15] <Synthead> what is the deal with ## and # anyway?
[11:21:26] <duch_kazatel> ## is for topics, # for official projects.
[11:21:34] <duch_kazatel> #jquery vs ##javascript
[11:21:37] <Synthead> oh interesting!
[11:22:11] <bosnian> duch_kazatel awesome
[11:22:13] <bosnian> didn't know that
[11:22:24] <duch_kazatel> Now You Do‚Ñ¢
[11:33:46] <Success> i use jquery now bc banned from javascript
[11:33:55] <Success> also jquery sounds funnier
[11:34:03] <taplar_> lol, that confused me for a sec
[11:34:19] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:34:28] <duch_kazatel> why are you banned from javascript?
[11:34:38] <Success> ^ things like that
[11:34:46] <sillyslux> ah bosnian moved on

[11:35:28] <Success> no ones in there
[11:35:44] <taplar_> irony is great
[11:37:46] <duch_kazatel> i should start spamming channels like that.
[11:37:55] <duch_kazatel> but advertise the channel you're already in.
[11:39:40] <Success> you guys should join #jquery they're super d3rpy n f\_/N to trull xD remember the ayylmao
[11:39:43] <Success> like that duch_kazatel ?
[11:39:49] <joinJquery> ^
[11:39:53] <duch_kazatel> welp
[11:40:05] <Success> >inb4 banhammers
[11:40:16] <Success> so does anyone in here use highland, or is jquery usually enough?
[11:40:16] <duch_kazatel> well i mean...
[11:40:34] <joinJquery> do a nick like this, join random channels and all you say is...
[11:40:36] <joinJquery> <--
[11:40:58] <duch_kazatel> Success highland and jquery do two different things.
[11:42:22] <Success> it sayed that name doesn't work
[11:42:36] <duch_kazatel> huh?

[11:42:58] <duch_kazatel> LEL
[11:51:31] <hashtag___> hi
[11:51:46] <hashtag___> So I apply a jquery plugin on a selector (also jquery) - and now I want to access a variable inside the plugin.
[11:52:10] <hashtag___> I want to access overlayObject from the callback function called by that plugin: https://github.com/diazemiliano/googlemaps-scrollprevent/blob/master/dist/googlemaps-scrollprevent.js#L151
[11:52:20] <hashtag___> However, whatever I try, I always get undefined or an object with options or something unrelated
[11:52:29] <hashtag___> I cannot even find the variable context in the debugger - I guess it is attached to the DOM element ?
[11:52:50] <duch_kazatel> wut
[11:53:05] <duch_kazatel> make a simplified example yo.
[11:54:04] <duch_kazatel> and it might be in the prototype chain somewhere, but this is a big chunk o' code.
[11:57:45] <hashtag___> hmmm
[11:58:38] <duch_kazatel> so wait.
[11:58:47] <duch_kazatel> you have a callback function, right?
[11:58:56] <duch_kazatel> like, one the user can pass is?
[11:59:30] <duch_kazatel> *pass one in
[12:01:06] <hashtag___> yes
[12:01:18] <hashtag___> http://pastebin.ca/3165300
[12:01:39] <hashtag___> duch_kazatel: ^
[12:02:03] <hashtag___> duch_kazatel: from the callback I need to know what element actually is affected, because this prevent scroll thing may have been applied on several elements
[12:03:27] <duch_kazatel> you have two options - use .call() or just pass the element back in an argument.
[12:03:59] <duch_kazatel> i'd go with the latter personally.
[12:11:32] <noahmg123> how can I easily push the value og an input element into the .on('input', function) function?
[12:11:40] <noahmg123> of*
[12:15:07] <robhol> huh
[12:15:42] <robhol> I'd imagine "this" would be the input element, but I don't actually know
[12:15:50] <hashtag___> duch_kazatel: pass the element back in an argument, nice - but how can I pass in the element the callback invoking jquery plugin is being attached to?
[12:15:57] <hashtag___> duch_kazatel: pardon my ignorance :)
[12:18:05] <hashtag___> oh damn, this became so complicated :/
[12:24:38] <duch_kazatel> $(this) would be the jquery object.
[12:27:21] <hashtag___> duch_kazatel: $(this) inside the callback function?
[12:27:43] <duch_kazatel> depends on how/what you're passing.
[12:27:50] <duch_kazatel> this is why a simplified fiddle is nice :)
[12:57:16] <omarOujdi> Hello
[12:57:21] <duch_kazatel> hola
[13:02:50] <matt34> hi, can someone please look at this simple toggleClass problem? Thanks for any help. http://jsbin.com/pukabajebi/edit?html,css,js,output
[13:03:32] <duch_kazatel> it's working.
[13:03:48] <matt34> when you click it?
[13:04:05] <duch_kazatel> let's clarify - the class is getting added.
[13:04:09] <duch_kazatel> your issue is weight.
[13:04:26] <duch_kazatel> in css, rules with ID selectors have more weight than ones with classes.
[13:04:54] <matt34> so if i have an id on an element i cant have classes?!
[13:05:01] <duch_kazatel> you can have classes.
[13:05:10] <duch_kazatel> but the properties of the ID take precedence.
[13:05:24] <duch_kazatel> #input.css { would work.
[13:06:08] <jessec> I have an element thats dynamically inserted into and removed from the dom. I'm curious what the recommended way of assigning an event handler would be. I could create the event handler directly after inserting the element or I could work to assign my event handler to a parent to catch it when it bubbles up. Any recommendations? I don't see any downsides of either way.
[13:06:30] <duch_kazatel> use a delegated listener.
[13:06:31] <matt34> duch_kazatel: wowthats weird, ive never seen anyone do #idName.className
[13:06:46] <duch_kazatel> matt34 this is why i avoid IDs like this :)
[13:06:58] <jessec> duch_kazatel: is there a benefit to that vs just assigning it when I insert the element?
[13:07:03] <matt34> okay thats what i was thinking, ill just use classes thanks for the hlep
[13:07:05] <duch_kazatel> less mental overhead.
[13:07:10] <duch_kazatel> less code overhead.
[13:07:15] <duch_kazatel> bind once and it just works.
[13:07:20] <jessec> It's the same code though.
[13:07:26] <duch_kazatel> the binding isn't though.
[13:07:31] <duch_kazatel> and that's the important part.
[13:07:46] <duch_kazatel> there's a small tradeoff.  i always favor a single delegated listener that i don't touch.
[13:07:49] <duch_kazatel> decouples things.
[13:23:19] <jessec> Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. I'm trying variations of this -> $('#modalContainer').on('hidden.bs.modal',".modal", function () { console.log('test') )}
[13:23:29] <hashtag___> duch_kazatel: alright - here a wonderful fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/pjrb7k03/13/
[13:23:33] <jessec> but the hidden.bs.modal even doesn't bubble up
[13:23:38] <duch_kazatel> jessec the modalContainer is likely getting removed
[13:23:41] <duch_kazatel> try the body
[13:23:46] <jessec> it's not getting removed
[13:24:06] <jessec> the modal is inserted into the modalContainer
[13:24:12] <duch_kazatel> jessec open the modal and do $('[id="modalContainer"]').length
[13:24:21] <duch_kazatel> iirc bootstrap does some really strange things with modals.
[13:24:51] <jessec> It just adds the display block to show it
[13:25:01] <jessec> nothing is removing it, I removed that code of mine for testing
[13:25:09] <jessec> the event just never gets to the element above it
[13:25:11] <duch_kazatel> removing/cloning.
[13:26:13] <duch_kazatel> hashtag___ yeah, i'd just use .bind() - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pjrb7k03/14/
[13:26:15] <jessec> I'll try another event
[13:26:37] <duch_kazatel> jessec try $('body') instead of $('#modalContainer') to test.
[13:28:47] <jessec> yeah that's not working at all even with a simple click event
[13:28:50] <jessec> has to be something else going on
[13:29:06] <duch_kazatel> open your console.
[13:29:32] <jessec> there are no errors, I'm working from the console
[13:29:46] <duch_kazatel> and even the body event binding doesn't work?
[13:30:10] <duch_kazatel> you sure you're not filtering console messages?
[13:30:21] <jessec> yeah, gonna try a few other things
[13:30:24] <jessec> maybe it's meteor
[13:33:00] <jessec> yeah something else is going on, if just put the code into the console manually it works
[13:33:30] <hashtag___> duch_kazatel: thank you.
[13:33:52] <hashtag___> duch_kazatel: I know what bind does, but why I had to use this inside the assignment is still hard for me to grasph
[13:33:57] <hashtag___> I mean, the assignment is done in an opts object
[13:34:10] <duch_kazatel> it's invocation context.
[13:34:12] <hashtag___> ah
[13:34:54] <hashtag___> invocation context , I need to read more about it
[13:35:15] <duch_kazatel> basically, where you run it from.
[13:35:32] <duch_kazatel> not where you defined it.
[13:35:46] <hashtag___> so I run it from inside the opts object - and the opts object is inside the object - so I can access everything
[13:37:24] <duch_kazatel> err.
[13:37:25] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:38:29] <hashtag___> ok, invocation context - I can set up what this the called function should see
[13:38:29] <duch_kazatel> you're defining it in the opts object
[13:38:31] <hashtag___> yes
[13:40:26] <jessec> duch_kazatel: ha, it was meteor the framework I'm using, it captures events within a template context, etc. etc, thanks for helping though
[13:42:12] <hashtag___> duch_kazatel: ok, so it is defined in opts object. When I don't use bind, the function will be in context of the opts object which got not the variables I want to access?
[13:44:34] <duch_kazatel> get ready for a knowledge bomb
[13:44:36] <duch_kazatel> If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function wasn't defined in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understa
[13:44:36] <duch_kazatel> nding-javascripts-this/
[13:44:54] <duch_kazatel> it's not about how it was defined, but how it was calle.d
[13:46:00] <hashtag___> ahhh
[13:46:10] <hashtag___> so when I call the _same function_ from c.b(), this will be c and no a
[13:46:13] <hashtag___> aha
[13:48:32] <hashtag___> thanks! it makes sense
[13:52:27] <lindii_> can anyone tell me whats wrong with birthdate.isValid() here http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1961/
[13:56:07] <duch_kazatel> you already have a birthday.
[13:56:09] <duch_kazatel> *birthdate
[13:57:03] <duch_kazatel> why not just http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/FLhpq/1962/
[13:57:11] <duch_kazatel> also: that's a lot of revisions.
[13:59:36] <lindii_> duch_kazatel: the problem is i need birthdate: moment("01/21/1989", 'MM/DD/YYYY').toDate();
[13:59:45] <duch_kazatel> why\?
[14:00:45] <lindii_> duch_kazatel: im using the object to insert data also after validation and moment("01/21/1989", 'MM/DD/YYYY') wont work
[14:01:34] <duch_kazatel> so then run the .toDate() when you need it in the other format?
[14:01:58] <lindii_> duch_kazatel: sorry what do you mean
[14:02:05] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[14:02:08] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle?
[14:02:15] <duch_kazatel> like, a more fleshed out one?
[14:03:31] <jessec> What is the problem/?
[14:03:35] <jessec> It works fine for me.
[14:08:26] <lindii_> duch_kazatel: should be something like http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1964/
[14:08:35] <jessec> Oh, I was looking at the fixed version.
[14:09:52] <duch_kazatel> lindii_ so you need it in moment format sometimes and not in others?
[14:10:06] <lindii_> duch_kazatel: just in the validation
[14:10:17] <jessec> var birthdate = moment(user.profile.birthdate, 'MM/DD/YYYY');
[14:10:28] <jessec> can you cast a moment date into another moment date?
[14:10:41] <duch_kazatel> something isn't making sense here.
[14:10:58] <duch_kazatel> like, can you just run toDate() when you need it?
[14:11:04] <lindii_> jessec: yes but then Accounts.createUser(user, function (error) { wont work without toDate()
[14:11:49] <jessec> No I mean, that's what you're doing. user.profile.birthdate is already a moment date
[14:11:54] <duch_kazatel> ^
[14:11:59] <jessec> there's no need to do moment(user.profile.birthdate
[14:12:08] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^^
[14:12:17] <duch_kazatel> just run the .toDate() when you need it.
[14:13:04] <jessec> er
[14:16:12] <jessec> I see the problem.
[14:16:24] <jessec> toDate is not what it seems to be
[14:16:32] <jessec> it's still bound to the moment object
[14:17:25] <lindii_> jessec: i need toDate to store the date
[14:21:29] <lindii_> so this way works http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1965/ but then im using the same object twice
[14:23:45] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean?
[14:25:30] <jessec> so the formatter
[14:25:37] <jessec> I think I got this :)
[14:27:25] <jessec> Alright so the problem is that when you're converting back into a moment object, the formatter doesn't match.
[14:27:46] <jessec> It doesn't  put out 01/21/1989 so it's not gonna end up being valid
[14:27:53] <lindii_> jessec: right
[14:28:01] <jessec> If you use toISOString and remove the formatter it works
[14:28:11] <jessec> otherwise you gotta output it and build a formatter that matches
[14:28:56] <lindii_> im kinda lost
[14:29:07] <jessec> https://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1964/
[14:29:40] <jessec> errors on accounts because it doesn't exist so you'll need to remove it
[14:31:37] <lindii_> jessec: im still getting date not valid there
[14:31:40] <jessec> https://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1964/
[14:31:55] <jessec> sorry https://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1966/
[14:32:02] <jessec> I didn't  hit update,
[14:32:14] <jessec> sun blinding me, I'll be right back
[14:34:51] <jessec> added the iso and todate in console -> http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1967/
[14:35:35] <jessec> if you really want to use toDAte just make the right format for it
[14:35:57] <jessec> http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/ -> that matches Sat Jan 21 1989 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)
[14:36:38] <lindii_> jessec: sorry let me check that
[14:40:49] <jessec> lindii_: even easier http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1968/
[14:41:00] <lindii_> jessec: that worked, but why not var birthdate = moment(user.profile.birthdate, "MM/DD/YYYY");
[14:41:15] <jessec> the date object returned by toDate can use .toUTCString which is compatible with moment(
[14:41:46] <jessec> because the output by .toDate is "Sat Jan 21 1989 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)"
[14:41:59] <jessec> that does not match the formatter "MM/DD/YYYY"
[14:42:12] <jessec> lindii_: https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1407
[14:42:23] <lindii_> jessec: in your ex if i use "dsdasdasd" it will still pass
[14:42:39] <jessec> You've got 3 options, two of them are iso and 1 is a date with a correct formatter explaining what you're feeding moment
[14:43:27] <jessec> hmm, yeah
[14:44:24] <lindii_> so isValid() is true
[14:44:46] <jessec> the isostring conversion probably doesn't care
[14:44:51] <jessec> the output will always be valid
[14:44:57] <lindii_> yeah
[14:45:02] <jessec> you'll probably have to stick with building a valid format
[14:45:36] <lindii_> jessec: you mean like a regex validation
[14:45:40] <jessec> Just remember this output by .toDate() - "Sat Jan 21 1989 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)" doesn't match ("MM/DD/YYY")
[14:46:03] <lindii_> sure
[14:47:20] <jessec> actually it seems toDate doesn't care either lol
[14:47:49] <jessec> wtf
[14:48:00] <lindii_> yeah i just figured out that
[14:49:47] <jessec> The expectation though is that the date coming in will be checked prior to it being stored right?
[14:50:15] <jessec> You wouldn't store the birthdate and then validate it later.
[14:50:20] <lindii_> jessec: yes
[14:50:36] <lindii_> lol no
[14:52:09] <jessec> still a problem in this situation because this is the object you want to use to create the account and the one that needs to be validated
[14:53:50] <lindii_> jessec: actually the idea works fine with any validation except this damn date
[14:54:42] <jessec> Not sure why moment would allow coverting any random thing into a valid date
[14:57:35] <jessec> what is binding the date being input to the user object? You're using some framework I assume?
[14:58:07] <lindii_> jessec: yes meteor
[14:58:18] <jessec> Oh
[14:58:33] <jessec> Well then I'm helping you solve a problem I was going to have soon in my own app, ha.
[14:59:44] <jessec> lindii_: https://atmospherejs.com/aldeed/collection2
[14:59:48] <lindii_> jessec: i have been dealing with this the whole day
[14:59:58] <jessec> This is what I planned on using to do my validations. It has built in methods for dates.
[15:00:20] <jessec> and it will validate both client and server side
[15:00:41] <lindii_> jessec: you can also use autoform
[15:02:26] <jessec> is the date validation not working on it?
[15:02:54] <lindii_> where
[15:03:12] <jessec> If you're using autoform it should have built-in validation
[15:03:20] <jessec> without needing to re-validate using moment
[15:03:37] <lindii_> jessec: no im not using autoform. this is a simple project just to test the framework
[15:04:12] <lindii_> anyways this looks more like a javascript issue though
[15:04:32] <jessec> in meteor I would never do the conversion though
[15:04:41] <jessec> if you don't use the .toDate or any other .to
[15:04:46] <jessec> then you can validate correctly
[15:05:25] <jessec> You could just write a template helper that takes that moment, validates it and then spits back out a .toDAte afterwards if you really needed it
[15:06:02] <lindii_> i think ill do that
[15:06:42] <jessec> or not http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1969/
[15:06:52] <jessec> that validates, lol
[15:09:54] <jessec> maybe it's the formatter that causes it to transform whatever you feed it into a date
[15:10:09] <jessec> I don't understand how that would make sense
[15:11:13] <lindii_> jessec: if somehow i could do var birthdate = moment(user.profile.birthdate, "MM/DD/YYYY"); then isValid() would work
[15:11:53] <jessec> if you dump the , "MM/DD/YYY" it will read it correctly
[15:12:14] <jessec> but according to the documentation it's not a reliable method to create moments in that manner
[15:13:33] <lindii_> weird
[15:14:12] <jessec> http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1970/
[15:14:56] <jessec> http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1971/
[15:16:37] <arc_> why has this been updated 1971 times o_O
[15:20:45] <jessec> Not sure, man everything I'm reading says that this crap shouldn't work -> moment("3r2fffdsfsdfd","MM/DD/YYY");
[15:23:08] <lindii_> and it still valid
[15:26:25] <jessec> How the hell does it not match its own toDate format though?
[15:26:34] <jessec> That method ended up with it failing the isValid
[15:26:38] <jessec> but a random string passes
[15:27:04] <lindii_> maybe a bug
[15:29:03] <lindii_> https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1407
[15:33:28] <jessec> I'm reading 1407 but it doesn't make sense, there are post claiming the exact opposite of what we're seeing
[15:33:49] <jessec> https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1407#issuecomment-111843458
[15:34:09] <jessec> this guy can't get the dates to validate and someone else comes back and says it's because his format doesn't match what's being input
[15:34:17] <jessec> where we get valid dates no matter what we put in
[15:39:07] <lindii_> doesnt make sense
[15:39:21] <jessec> var thisIsAlwaysValid = moment(Date.parse("3r2fffdsfsdfd"),"MM/DD/YYY").isValid();
[15:39:29] <jessec> that produces correctly
[15:40:18] <jessec> nevermind
[15:40:25] <jessec> just another way to make it always invalid
[15:42:49] <jessec> I think I'm about done
[15:42:52] <jessec> regex is king
[15:43:42] <lindii_> yeah
[15:43:48] <jessec> good info to know for the future though, anything deal with dates is probably lying to you
[15:44:06] <lindii_> thanks anyway
[15:46:45] <jessec> if you do this it detects if it's invalid -> var blah = new Date("92urkljflskdf");
[15:46:54] <jessec> Date.parse will convert anything into a date though
[17:13:46] <poolson> hey im trying to display a list of items that i want to be able to select by either a mouse click or scroll the mousewheel to highlight items
[17:14:16] <poolson> any ideas about how to implement .. or even if theres a common name for this type of navigation/interaction
[17:14:21] <poolson> so i can search for it !
[17:18:16] <jessec> multiselect list?
[17:19:14] <jessec> poolson like this? http://loudev.com/
[18:02:19] <lindii_> jessec: var thisIsAlwaysValid = moment("3r2fffdsfsdfd","MM/DD/YYY", true); returns false
[18:02:35] <jessec> wat
[18:02:48] <jessec> what's the third param?
[18:02:55] <duch_kazatel> strict parsing mode
[18:03:12] <lindii_>  As of version 2.3.0, you may specify a boolean for the last argument to make Moment use strict parsing. Strict parsing requires that the format and input match exactly.
[18:03:16] <jessec> D:
[18:04:30] <jessec> I gotta learn to rtfm a bit slower. :)
[18:05:41] <lindii_> anyways it still returns true for random strings
[18:05:59] <duch_kazatel> how are you defining "valid"?
[18:06:29] <lindii_> isValid()?
[18:06:38] <duch_kazatel> right - what does that mean?
[18:07:59] <duch_kazatel> isValid is false for things like february 30th
[18:08:11] <duch_kazatel> are you verifying that the format of the date is valid?
[18:08:22] <lindii_> duch_kazatel: ok but it still return true with "adasdasdsad"
[18:08:32] <duch_kazatel> because the parser is returning a valid date.
[18:08:45] <duch_kazatel> are you verifying if the user gave you a valid date format?
[18:09:06] <lindii_> yes
[18:09:13] <duch_kazatel> moment.js is not a good tool for that.
[18:09:24] <jessec> duch_kazatel: the expectation was that moment, given a format would check the string to see if it's valid rather than spit out a date.
[18:09:26] <duch_kazatel> moment is really forgiving in trying to figure out what date a string represents.
[18:09:31] <jessec> but yeah, that doesn't happen
[18:09:46] <duch_kazatel> nope, moment will do everything it can to generate a date.
[18:09:55] <duch_kazatel> it's not a good tool for validating user input.
[18:10:38] <lindii_> would rather use the Date object
[18:10:46] <duch_kazatel> that's not the right tool, either.
[18:10:49] <duch_kazatel> you want to verify user input.
[18:10:59] <duch_kazatel> the date object and moment are not tools for user input validation.
[18:11:16] <duch_kazatel> this is why people use datepickers.
[18:14:01] <Klarth> Yeah, but shouldn't you still perform input validation because somebody will eventually submit fake form data?
[18:14:14] <duch_kazatel> that's what i'm saying.
[18:14:18] <duch_kazatel> moment isn't for input validation.
[18:14:24] <duch_kazatel> but that's what they're trying to use it for.
[18:14:33] <duch_kazatel> so validate the input.  and use a datepicker.
[18:14:53] <Klarth> Gotcha.
[18:15:01] <duch_kazatel> the bigger point is "don't use moment for validation"
[18:15:41] <duch_kazatel> that's like people who try to use jquery like an mvs
[18:15:43] <duch_kazatel> *mvc
[18:16:14] <jessec> but, if you've never used moment before, reading about it gives a very good impression that it's used for just that
[18:16:49] <duch_kazatel> i disagree.
[18:17:00] <jessec> I suppose it's perception really.
[18:17:30] <duch_kazatel> it's date validation, not user input validation :)
[18:19:25] <jessec> If you gave me a method that validated if a number was more than 50 and I gave you a string instead of a number
[18:19:40] <jessec> would the expectation be that the method would possibly return true?
[18:19:52] <duch_kazatel> what does the documentation say?
[18:20:29] <duch_kazatel> because i'd expect an error.
[18:20:35] <duch_kazatel> but that's not the same thing as what moment.js does.
[18:20:52] <jessec> I would as well, but I'm saying to me, their documentation is misleading when it talks about validation.
[18:21:02] <duch_kazatel> not to me.
[18:21:08] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty clear about what it's validating.
[18:21:47] <duch_kazatel> is the date that moment returns a real date?
[18:22:14] <jessec> How can you get that moment("jflksjfkldfjsdf","MM/YY/DD").isValid() would give you a valid date though?
[18:22:21] <jessec> I don't gather that from the documentation at all.
[18:22:29] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't give me a valid date.
[18:22:52] <duch_kazatel> moment("jflksjfkldfjsdf","MM/YY/DD") parses an input into a moment object - its parser might be really forgiving.
[18:22:59] <jessec> http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1971/
[18:23:13] <duch_kazatel> .isValid(), per their docs, then tests to see if that's a date that could exist.
[18:23:23] <duch_kazatel> ie - february 30th would return false.
[18:24:39] <jessec> It also says that it will match the format to the input, but in this case, how is that being achieved?
[18:24:54] <duch_kazatel> it's really forgiving.
[18:25:01] <jessec> If you pass it without the formatter you get false because it doesn't match the ISO format.
[18:25:35] <duch_kazatel> the issue is that the parser is overly forgiving.  3r2fffdsfsdfd is 200-03-02T08:00:00.000z
[18:25:57] <jessec> I get it, but still not a fan of the documentation. If it's overly forgiving it should have a note that says, "we'll convert your turkeys into dates"
[18:25:59] <duch_kazatel> err, 2000-03-02T08:00:00.000z
[18:26:15] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty clear about what it's going to to do to me.
[18:26:17] <duch_kazatel> but okauy.
[18:26:20] <duch_kazatel> *okay
[18:26:45] <jessec> although the strict addition is working for me, is it not for you lindii_?
[18:28:14] <lindii_> jessec: have you tried that in the validation?
[18:32:46] <jessec> lindii_: http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1972/
[18:33:56] <jessec> although, like duch_kazatel said, probably wouldn't use it to validate the input, maybe use some regex beforehand
[18:34:34] <lindii_> jessec: https://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1973/
[18:34:36] <lindii_> like that
[18:35:43] <jessec> yeah, that's working
[18:36:29] <lindii_> i would do some regex. im not trusting this library
[18:37:06] <jessec> if you do console.log(user.profile.birthdate); it says "Invalid date" as well
[18:38:06] <jessec> yeah def. I have a whole recurring schedule setup I am going to use moment and moment-recur for, good to know these things beforehand
[18:38:48] <lindii_> jessec: check this https://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1974/
[18:40:17] <jessec> ... haha
[18:40:54] <lindii_> 1.10.6 changes
[18:41:42] <jessec> Oh, weak. That must have been that depreciation change.
[18:44:06] <jessec> lindii_: if you don't run it through the converter in the latest version it works http://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1976/
[18:44:43] <lindii_> im using the latest version though
[18:47:08] <jessec> use the strict again
[18:50:11] <jessec> lindii_: check it out https://jsfiddle.net/FLhpq/1977/
[18:50:24] <jessec> var birthdate = moment(user.profile.birthdate, moment.ISO_8601, true);
[18:50:45] <jessec> bah, nevermind
[18:52:07] <lindii_> jessec: same shit
[18:54:01] <jessec> I'm not even gonna validate in my app, I now consider potatoe a valid birthday choice. Done.
[18:55:04] <lindii_> jessec: lol
[21:28:38] <droid909> why this doesnt' work https://jsfiddle.net/8o7eo8go/
[21:30:14] <droid909> i just took it from example, why it doesn't work?!
[21:30:27] <droid909> stupid jsfiddle
[21:30:31] <droid909> or me
[21:34:34] <Success> droid909, works for me..
[22:33:25] <infoget> Hi guys, I would like to use multi select for search (get method), but before submitting I want to alter parameter from array to string, $multiSelect.val().join("+");  this doesn't work because the multiselect expects only arrays, can u help me with this?
[22:35:19] <arup_r> Hi.. I have JS code to work upon on a click event. But for each click, the code is executing 2 times. http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/bVpyZQ But it should execute only once.
[22:35:25] <arup_r> Any idea why so ?
[22:52:17] <arup_r> Found the answer http://stackoverflow.com/a/13756844/2767755
[23:42:17] <arup_r> How can I available the tenant_id value inside the .ajax() call ? http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/XmdLJd
[23:42:38] <arup_r> current it is saying tenant_id is "undefined"
[23:50:38] <arup_r> nvm I fixed it
