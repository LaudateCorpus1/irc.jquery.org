[00:12:11] <MickRip> coldhead: that jay guy is the typical indian developer, writing bad spaghetti PHP who solves problems with google rather than experience - who works for $5 a day. (I would bet any money that his client won't get the product)
[00:12:42] <coldhead> now now, no need to get racist
[00:12:58] <coldhead> some people just suck at netiquette and will struggle their entire careers as a result
[00:13:04] <coldhead> indian or otherwise
[00:13:27] <MickRip> it wasn't really racist
[00:13:45] <MickRip> perhaps a generalisation, not not racist
[00:13:53] <coldhead> generalising about a nationallity is pretty racist
[00:14:40] <MickRip> coldhead: if I made the conclusion without seeing his code, then that'd be racist
[00:15:06] <coldhead> conclude he's a poor developer then, not what his passport says :P
[00:15:16] <coldhead> there are plenty of highly competent indian developers
[00:15:32] <coldhead> you just don't notice because they aren't massively retarded
[00:15:35] <coldhead> cc dytrivedi
[01:30:50] <dblosevn> ++coldhead your correct about once every 3 to 4 years i find a good indian developer so they definitely exist you just have to dig past the countless 1000's of them that read a learn php in 5 minutes book and think theree an experienced developer to find them
[01:34:18] <screamingbanshee> dblosevn {sideways eyes}
[01:34:34] <dblosevn> :D
[01:52:48] <absentbird> Hello
[01:53:46] <absentbird> So I have a $.get that retrieves some JSON but I can only read it inside the success function.
[01:54:43] <dblosevn> thats kind of the point of it if you need it outside the success youd have to do something like
[01:55:07] <absentbird> So inside the success function I can do `alert(data[1]);` and it works but if I do `globalvar = data` then later `alert(globalvar[1]` I get undefined.
[01:55:29] <dblosevn> $.get('url', {params}, function (ret) { getreturn = ret; });
[01:55:48] <absentbird> dblosevn: right, that is what I am trying to do.
[01:56:07] <dblosevn> then you could access the last response via the variable getreturn from any scope
[01:56:26] <absentbird> Yeah, but when I do that I get undefined.
[01:56:31] <dblosevn> not necessarily the way i would do it as getreturn might be undefined if the ajax query failed
[01:56:45] <dblosevn> i think your missing the point
[01:56:55] <absentbird> Maybe I am
[01:56:58] <dblosevn> you need to assign the return value to a global varible
[01:57:13] <dblosevn> do not use
[01:57:13] <absentbird> >.< Let me just post a gist
[01:57:40] <dblosevn> var getreturn = ret; would make getreturn have the scope of the callback
[01:57:49] <dblosevn> where
[01:57:57] <dblosevn> getreturn = ret; would get global scope
[01:59:32] <absentbird> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5559370
[01:59:58] <dblosevn> thattl never work
[02:00:33] <absentbird> Thanks.
[02:01:30] <dblosevn> whereas this will http://dblosevn.chosd.com/159
[02:01:51] <dblosevn> asuuming that 'json' was a valid url
[02:02:29] <MickRip> what dblosevn said
[02:02:33] <absentbird> Well what I want to do is be able to access `state` outside of the `$.get` scope.
[02:02:56] <MickRip> absentbird: learn about http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[02:04:31] <dblosevn> My solution allows you to do that
[02:05:35] <dblosevn> you just cant use it before the callback completes oviously... $.get is asyncronous so the code under it was being processed before the ajax call completed
[02:06:08] <absentbird> Ah, right. Because JS will start the query and not wait for it to finish.
[02:06:14] <dblosevn> and you were trying to return the callback which doesnt work as the return value goes nowehre
[02:06:52] <absentbird> Right, that was just something I changed out of desperation (along with the added alerts)
[02:07:26] <absentbird> I am coming back to JS after a long time with just Python. I am kind of rusty.
[02:07:31] <dblosevn> ya, that should get you what you need but oviously youll need to do some sanitytests to be sure that state is not undefined before trying to use it
[02:07:54] <dblosevn> *outside of the callback
[02:09:32] <dblosevn> also as MickRip suggested deffered callbacks would also work although a little more complicated
[02:10:06] <absentbird> So is `promise()` the standard way to do that now? I vaguely remember something to do with async.
[02:10:32] <dblosevn> read up on it, that is using defered callbacks
[02:11:19] <dblosevn> basically your queing up callbacks with a promise that youll fire the queue when all the required data is avaialble
[02:11:21] <absentbird> So what does that mean? It just keeps going until it needs the deferred variable then hangs until it is done?
[02:11:36] <absentbird> Got it.
[02:13:35] <MickRip> promises are over complicated and it's pretty rare you have to use them, but it helps understand why absentbird's first try didn't work
[02:13:57] <dblosevn> MickRip++
[02:14:48] <absentbird> So what would you recommend? It seems like the simplest solution would be to make the call asynchronously since all the other bits depend on it.
[02:15:16] <dblosevn> well id put all that othercode in the callback if possible
[02:15:35] <dblosevn> if not id bailout of the othercode if state is undefined
[02:15:44] <absentbird> To explain my project there is a board game rendered in HTML and the data for the game is at <url>/json. The JS needs to get the information and place the game pieces.
[02:16:03] <dblosevn> that deserves to be in the callback
[02:16:25] <dblosevn> once loaded it can be accessed outside of the callback for later use
[02:17:06] <MickRip> at the top of your app, just declare your objects
[02:17:06] <absentbird> What do you mean? How can I use it elsewhere if I am not sure it has finished loading?
[02:17:24] <dblosevn> well you would do something like
[02:17:34] <dblosevn> if (undefined === state) return;
[02:17:50] <dblosevn> in the places that rely on state to be defined
[02:18:28] <dblosevn> once the callback completes place all the peices on the board and let the rest of the code run;
[02:18:35] <absentbird> But then those thing wouldn't get done so I would have to keep retrying until state was not undefined.
[02:18:59] <dblosevn> sounds like you have a logic prblem
[02:19:15] <dblosevn> to me it would seem that you wouldnt want the app to do anything before the callback comepleted
[02:19:38] <absentbird> Right. That is why I was thinking of setting async to False.
[02:19:45] <dblosevn> so id add a hook in the callback to start the app
[02:19:58] <dblosevn> absentbird: never do that it blocks the browser
[02:20:50] <absentbird> Ok. So I will just make a setboard(state) function and call it when the callback finishes.
[02:21:19] <dblosevn> thats a better plan
[02:21:40] <absentbird> Alright. Thanks for your help.
[02:21:47] <dblosevn> or in the callback do something like
[02:21:55] <dblosevn> state = value; start_app()
[02:22:04] <MickRip> depends on how your board is drawn too
[02:22:38] <absentbird> What would `start_app()` do? Is that an example or a jquery thing?
[02:23:08] <dblosevn> an example, make start_app start all your listeners and gamestate
[02:24:18] <dblosevn> although id prolly go with dleegated events for what your trying to do
[02:24:26] <dblosevn> *delegated
[02:25:08] <MickRip> absentbird: how is your game board drawn? Tables? Floated divs?
[02:25:49] <absentbird> Right now I just have a table with 10 rows and 10 columns but I am thinking of different methods.
[02:26:15] <MickRip> absentbird: and your ajax request returns json data which is an array with co-ords?
[02:26:23] <absentbird> Yep
[02:27:45] <absentbird> btw dblosevn, I put all of the app in an app_start(state) function and called it with the $(document).ready() function and it works like a charm. Thanks!
[02:27:58] <MickRip> absentbird: Yeah, I'd basically display:none for the <table> .. and then display:block after it's drawn ..
[02:28:06] <dblosevn> :-D
[02:28:20] <MickRip> absentbird: and do things identically to how dblosevn suggested
[02:28:45] <absentbird> Yeah, it is working now. I just forgot about JavaScript's asynchronous nature.
[02:29:10] <absentbird> After spending so much time with procedural code it is interesting. A different way of thinking.
[02:29:27] <MickRip> javascript can do your head in sometimes :P
[02:30:02] <MickRip> I only ever look in the sky in disbelief when I'm javascripting
[02:30:44] <absentbird> A few years ago I did almost everything in JS but then at work I got assigned to backend programming. Now I am doing a hobby project and I forgot everything (and JS has advanced like a billion times faster than I thought it would)
[02:31:52] <MickRip> my first jquery pluggin :P ... http://playground.mickrip.com/aqua/
[02:33:22] <MickRip> (don't forget to add fish!)
[02:34:14] <Munir> Hello, everyone know german =
[02:34:36] <dblosevn> probally the germans lol
[02:34:44] <absentbird> So calming...
[02:35:16] <Munir> ?
[02:35:29] <absentbird> Sorry, I was talking about the link MickRip shared.
[02:35:30] <MickRip> absentbird: zoom out to 20% or something .. (this is how I should have done it to begin with, but I was writing a car racing game and those fish used to be cars)
[02:35:34] <absentbird> http://playground.mickrip.com/aqua/
[02:36:40] <dblosevn> MickRip: you sure they werent airplanes? cause id hate to be in that car if it was a car
[02:36:45] <dblosevn> lmao
[02:37:13] <absentbird> One thing you might want to change. When you click the 'add fish' button it also stimulates them. Not sure if that is WAI.
[02:37:34] <MickRip> dblosevn: hahahaha, my physics programming isn't strong
[02:38:58] <Munir> somebody know german ?
[02:39:21] <absentbird> Do you speak German Munir?
[02:39:26] <Munir> yes
[02:39:33] <Munir> my english ist very bad
[02:39:42] <Munir> *is
[02:40:49] <absentbird> You could try using Google Translate. Are all jquery functions in English or are there other supported languages?
[02:41:16] <dabear_> haha
[02:41:23] <Munir> absentbird, do you have teamviewer?
[02:41:25] <dabear_> jquery api in german
[02:41:33] <dabear_> would have been a nice april fools
[02:42:22] <absentbird> No, I use VNC mostly.
[02:42:29] <absentbird> Or that Chrome plugin.
[02:42:49] <sonotos> Munir: #jquery-de
[02:42:54] <MickRip> $(dokumentieren).bereit(function(){ alert("achtung baby"); }
[02:43:32] <sonotos> dabear_: hm well at least german language supports chaining as jquery does hrhr
[02:43:52] <Munir> ok i try^^
[02:44:06] <dabear_> achtung!
[02:45:23] <dabear_> $(dokument).klar(funksjon(){  varsle("Helmaks, folkens!") })
[02:46:04] <MickRip> hehee, english to german javascript/jquery translator
[02:46:25] <MickRip> actually, english to pirate jquery would be cooler
[02:46:31] <Munir> ^^
[02:46:39] <dblosevn> Argh me matey
[02:46:42] <MickRip> $(arrrrrrrrrrrrrrr)
[02:46:43] <MickRip> that's it
[02:46:55] <MickRip> the whole code-base, no matter how big, turns to $(aarrrrrrrrrrr)
[02:47:20] <sonotos> MickRip: feels like md5 file compression
[02:47:21] <MickRip> or $("body").html("<div>arrrrrr</div>");
[02:47:48] <sonotos> very efficient, only decompression is a little tricky
[02:47:52] <MickRip> hahaha
[02:47:52] <krisfremen> $(medocument).firstmate(does(){land("hoo");})
[02:48:26] <MickRip> $("#pirate").rape().pillage();
[02:48:34] <dblosevn> if (@sea) women.removeClothes()
[02:49:03] <absentbird> Well I gotta go to bed. Thanks everyone!

[03:24:01] <lolmaus> Hi! I would like to adjust the outerWidth of an element. I can read it, but how do i set it?

[05:28:34] <lolmaus> ah
[05:28:58] <lolmaus> It should be `$(".pane:visible")`, right?
[05:29:43] <Miki__> ???

[05:30:20] <coldhead> ?filter @ lolmaus
[05:30:20] <bot-t> lolmaus, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/

[08:34:35] <motaka2> hello I CAN'T capture click event on UL LI A using $("#content-in").on("click", 'a', function() {....} while it works fine for all other links on the page, from where I should start debugging ?
[08:35:59] <shoky> motaka2: it works fine for all other links? what other links? what's different about this link? a jsfiddle would help
[08:36:29] <motaka2> shoky: I cant create js fiddle for this ,
[08:37:25] <shoky> motaka2: you've not given enough info for anyone to really help you, except for going through obvious questions like "is #content-in in the DOM when you're calling that .on?"
[08:37:49] <shoky> and it's really annoying to spit out obvious questions when we can't even look at your problem
[08:38:16] <shoky> why can't you create a jsfiddle for this? have you tried?
[08:38:18] <motaka2> shoky: I understand you. You are right
[08:38:36] <shoky> by trying to reproduce it in a jsfiddle, you'll probably eventually figure it out yourself
[08:38:50] <shoky> that's where you should start debugging.
[08:40:05] <shoky> at least pastebin some html & code ...
[08:40:50] <wilkinsmc> i have a form where I'm animating fields' opacity and position based on field values. If i change the values too fast I seem to get unwelcome opacity changes. Is there any way to reset animation of opacities every time i change the values?
[08:41:19] <sacho> .stop()
[08:41:39] <motaka2> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/xJJXL/
[08:41:50] <wilkinsmc> .stop doesn't seem to work
[08:42:11] <styx51> here i am again .. here is the fiddle for who can help me : http://jsfiddle.net/styx51/bWcc5/
[08:42:15] <wilkinsmc> the animations are delayed on button presses tho
[08:42:28] <styx51> it s to try to make a responsive function for my website
[08:42:42] <shoky> motaka2: what is #main? does it contain #content-in?
[08:42:50] <sacho> wilkinsmc, do you really think "doesn't seem to work" is useful info?
[08:43:07] <shoky> motaka2: you didn't even show #content-in in your html..
[08:45:57] <motaka2> shoky: content-in contains main
[08:46:05] <shoky> styx51: what's the problem? what are you trying to do? if it's line 34 that's bothering you, it probably should be console.log(val);
[08:47:12] <styx51> shoky : my trouble is about resize .. resize your web browser and u ll see that green div modifying correctly width and height but not blue and orange one
[08:47:35] <styx51> can t see how to loop on each div of the first div correctly
[08:47:49] <shoky> motaka2: what's the problem exactly?
[08:48:29] <motaka2> when I click on edit or add , ... I cant see the alert("clicked")
[08:49:20] <shoky> styx51: $('#div1 > div').each(...)   or $('#div1').children().each(...)
[08:50:42] <shoky> motaka2: and does it follow the link instead of doing the ajax?
[08:50:55] <shoky> motaka2: and you say its fine for the other buttons?
[08:51:33] <motaka2> yes it's fine for other buttons
[08:51:40] <shoky> motaka2: since you're doing async:false on your ajax.. maybe try event.preventDefault() at the beginning of your click handler, instead of return false at the end
[08:51:55] <motaka2> and it fallows the link instead of ajax
[08:52:04] <shoky> try preventDefault() ..
[08:52:08] <shoky> before the ajax
[08:52:11] <styx51> thx shoky trying it
[08:52:17] <shoky> or of course.. stop doing async:false
[08:52:46] <shoky> ?async
[08:52:47] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[08:53:36] <motaka2> shoky: not working
[08:53:48] <shoky> motaka2: repaste
[08:54:56] <motaka2> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/xJJXL/1/
[08:55:25] <shoky> motaka2: comon dude you're supposed to know how to use preventDefault with jquery
[08:55:47] <motaka2> shoky: I really dont knoe
[08:55:47] <shoky> motaka2: http://jsfiddle.net/xJJXL/2/
[08:57:05] <motaka2> shoky: thx, but it doesnt work
[08:57:38] <shoky> motaka2: then give us an actual demo of the problem.. i'm out of made-up ideas
[08:57:53] <motaka2> lemme see what I can do
[08:58:40] <motaka2> shoky: It just happens on those UL LIs
[08:59:52] <shoky> motaka2: "those" is meaningless without seeing any others
[09:00:01] <motaka2> ok
[09:01:29] <wilkinsmc> The opacity animations run in timeout functions that wait a few seconds after a form value is changed. If i change the form value quickly a bunch of times I get opacity changes when I don't want them. I need a way to prevent the timeout animations from running if the form value is changed before they're ran.
[09:01:42] <motaka2> shoky: Check this pls:  http://jsfiddle.net/xJJXL/4/
[09:06:01] <shoky> motaka2: uh you're running some tree plugin on the <ul> with the <a>'s ?
[09:06:35] <motaka2> shoky: Yes
[09:07:10] <shoky> motaka2: i'd imagine that changes the html inside..
[09:07:27] <shoky> well, the elements inside
[09:08:24] <motaka2> shoky: Wanna see it's code?
[09:08:29] <shoky> i also see that #main is the container of the links.. and you're changing its html yourself in your code..
[09:08:46] <motaka2> shoky: Yes
[09:09:50] <shoky> are you sure there are still <a>'s inside? ;p  also maybe that plugin is handling clicks itself and not propagating them
[09:11:01] <motaka2> shoky: Yes it does
[09:11:59] <shoky> motaka2: how long do you want to keep this obvious-questions routine going? i'm getting tired
[09:12:09] <motaka2> here is the code for the tree:  http://jsfiddle.net/tbqPT/
[09:12:25] <shoky> no thanks.
[09:12:43] <motaka2> ok - I dont know how to stop it
[09:12:50] <shoky> make it work in the jsfiddle so i can see the problem, or stfu ;p
[09:15:42] <shoky> motaka2:  ddtreemenu.preventpropagate=function(e){ //prevent action from bubbling upwards
[09:15:57] <shoky> i'm guessing that may have to do with the problem ...
[09:16:29] <motaka2> shoky: thx
[09:17:04] <shoky> (the click event has to bubble up to #content-in for that .on() to work )
[09:24:34] <relipse> how do i find an input whose name is plan and value is free
[09:24:48] <relipse> $('input[name=plan][value=free]') ?
[09:27:38] <shoky> all this time i thought motaka2 was someone else :S
[09:28:44] <iig> relipse: quote plan and free with "
[09:29:22] <relipse> iig: not necessary
[09:29:38] <geoid> greetz!
[09:30:16] <shoky> relipse: i dont think you can look for value like that, unless its the actual attribute you're looking for
[09:30:36] <relipse> it is an attribute in this case
[09:30:40] <geoid> I'm trying to get a working localStorage example. However, Modernizr.localstorage returns false? I've tried Chrome v26.x and Firefox 16az`
[09:30:46] <relipse> its a radio button
[09:31:17] <shoky> relipse: then i think that should work, dont remember rly
[09:32:47] <geoid> Any clues?
[09:34:38] <shoky> geoid: console.log( window.localStorage )
[09:35:21] <geoid> returns false shoky, but I find that very surprising that Chrome doesn't support localStorage
[09:35:34] <wer0ckz> Hi guys. help please. what's the best clipboard plugin for copy and paste?
[09:38:17] <shoky> geoid: what do you mean, "returns false" ?  it logs "false" to the console?
[09:41:38] <innociv_> How do you change the select box index in a way that triggers .change()?
[09:42:02] <innociv_> Besides calling change()
[09:42:19] <geoid> shoky never mind, i wuz being dumb
[09:43:17] <shoky> innociv_: change it with the mouse
[09:43:35] <innociv_> lol
[09:43:50] <shoky> no lol, that's pretty much the only other way :P
[09:45:33] <abjorn> .val() should call a change event I'm p sure
[09:45:46] <abjorn> otherwise you could just explicitly call .change()
[09:45:57] <innociv_> but val doesn't go by index. I'd have to find the value for that index first.
[09:46:01] <wer0ckz> Hi guys. help please. what's the best clipboard plugin for copy and paste?
[09:46:09] <innociv_> So I guess I'll just call change()
[09:46:11] <abjorn> so then find the value for the index
[09:46:19] <abjorn> not that hard
[10:02:15] <wilkinsmc> The opacity animations run in timeout functions that wait a few seconds after a form value is changed. If i change the form value quickly a bunch of times I get opacity changes when I don't want them. I need a way to prevent the timeout animations from running if the form value is changed before they're ran.
[10:21:02] <motaka2> Does anyone has any idea, how I can first make ajaxed scrpt loaded then the HTML ?
[10:36:04] <wer0ckz> Help please. http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/6pXRX/ - the 'copy' text is still on my browser firefox. im using attr('disable')
[10:43:36] <iig> wer0ckz: what are you trying to do?
[10:45:03] <RigidWig> anyone know how to get a div's width() which seems to change even after console logging its width on $(window).load()?
[10:46:48] <BillCriswell> RigidWig: Do images load in the div?
[10:46:55] <TigerParket> how do i update a block content with ajax ?
[10:47:26] <RigidWig> BillCriswell I think so, or at the very least, the images loading extend one of the containers, and the div who's width() I am getting is set to inherit 100% of said container.
[10:47:45] <RigidWig> but (document)ready() and (window).load are both too early...
[11:02:12] <LennyLinux> Hi, noob question: why should i use jQuery.ready(func) when i can placing all the scripts at the bottom of body and obtain (? i think) the same result?
[11:03:08] <Jayflux> LennyLinux http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6026645/document-readyfunction-vs-script-at-the-bottom-of-page
[11:03:21] <LennyLinux> Cool :D
[11:03:53] <LennyLinux> THanks
[11:37:59] <Assimilater> indeed that was the problem, silly me
[11:38:05] <Assimilater> ravenzz: thanks again :)
[11:38:54] <newtothis> if i do, a(p) = {this.p=p};  b.prototype = new a(); do i need to explictly add b.prototype.constructor = a.constructor; or something like that to keep b using a's constructor?
[11:39:29] <newtothis> (b, c and others have identical data to a but different functions available)
[11:40:57] <newtothis> actually from what i see, i don't have to do function a(p) = {this.p=p}; and can keep it at function a(p) {};, right? or am i missing something?
[11:51:19] <Jabberwock> What is going on with Freenode!?
[11:53:12] <newtothis> Jabberwock, servers msg says something about netsplits due to ddos
[11:53:24] <Jabberwock> Ah crap I had a feeling.
[11:53:35] <Jabberwock> This happened to DALnet around 11 years ago and lasted 3 months
[11:54:30] <anthonym> Yeah, thats what killed DAL
[11:54:34] <newtothis> yea i remember having lots of connection problems there... :/
[11:54:48] <anthonym> I admin'ed AustNET from 1995 to 2008, I remember that
[11:54:53] <anthonym> We also went down for months.
[11:56:17] <rohdef> what's happening?
[11:56:56] <Jabberwock> DoS
[11:57:02] <anthonym> DDoS
[11:57:14] <rohdef> on freenode? or?
[11:57:31] <Jabberwock> yeah all its servers apparently
[11:57:33] <anthonym> yes on thier servers
[11:57:40] <anthonym> it happens
[11:57:44] <rohdef> ok, I got in without trouble
[11:57:53] <anthonym> the best they can do is have the datacentres mitigate it as much as possible
[11:58:54] <rohdef> but too bad, hope they can put it out of the game soon, would be sad if freenode goes down
[11:59:05] <Jabberwock> I didn't think DDoS was popular anymore.
[11:59:11] <Jabberwock> at least on IRC networks
[12:00:00] <Jabberwock> I wonder where people are getting the firepower. Back in the day you'd write a script to log into a couple thousand ciscos and ping hosts but people are smarter about changing passwords now
[12:01:14] <rohdef> there's still a lot of ways to create botnets, but why? I though most hacking today is fanatics (Anonymous) and for profit
[12:01:59] <rohdef> as far as I can see there's no point from neither of those perspectives to pick on freenode (or any IRC server I know of for that matter)
[12:02:27] <anthonym> DDoS are popular still yes
[12:02:33] <anthonym> because DDoS can do significant harm
[12:04:08] <Jabberwock> I know… just haven't heard of them in years
[12:04:22] <Jabberwock> Every once in a blue moon I'll get an InfraGard email about attacks on government systems
[12:04:39] <anthonym> one of my retarded mates went to jail here in Aus for one in 1997
[12:04:56] <anthonym> Took down major cable television networks in singapore among other things
[12:05:01] <Jabberwock> wow.
[12:05:05] <anthonym> just scriptkiddies with nothing better to do
[12:05:12] <Jabberwock> yep.  :/
[12:06:52] <tw2113> they should get haircuts and real jobs
[12:07:13] <JBreit> one of my friends who just passed away on the 14th was arrested for DDOS when he attacked the US military domains and NASA
[12:07:33] <JBreit> he was like 13 or 14 when he got arrested for it
[12:07:36] <JBreit> lol
[12:08:45] <JBreit> only reason he even got in trouble for it is he was boasting about it on irc.standford.edu when it was connected to EFnet
[12:08:54] <JBreit> stupid stuff though regardless
[12:09:24] <Jabberwock> Yeah that was silly to admit
[12:09:30] <Jabberwock> Especially on efnet
[12:09:34] <tw2113> we could punish these scriptkiddies by making them work for the government
[12:10:01] <tw2113> no, then they get free healthcare and too much vacation time
[12:10:03] <Jabberwock> tw2113: Anyone with a long list of routers can perform a DDoS attack with little to no knowledge of what they're doing.
[12:10:04] <tw2113> nevermind
[12:10:07] <anthonym> yeah, another of my mates has just done 12 months in prison here in Aussie for hacking bottledomains
[12:10:22] <anthonym> They stole all their customers credit cards and registered thousands of free domains using their api
[12:10:26] <anthonym> it was fairly rooted.
[12:10:59] <Jabberwock> I have a 'caught by the feds' story but I'd rather not talk about it :/
[12:11:11] <Jabberwock> Suffice it to say I was given no choice but to join InfraGard lol
[12:11:46] <JBreit> my friend ended up having to work for the feds for a while showing them how to secure their systems up before thy cut him lose or he would have done more than a year
[12:12:11] <JBreit> aparently they didn't like that they got owned by a 13-14 yr old dude who taught himself programming
[12:12:47] <tw2113> i honestly think the FBI/higher "intelligence" people should punish anyone that gets through their systems by making them help patch holes
[12:13:03] <tw2113> clearly the person will be smart enough to find them
[12:13:04] <JBreit> another guy I know just got locked up for swatting miley Cyrus
[12:13:07] <JBreit> heh
[12:13:08] <Jabberwock> They hire quite a few people they arrest
[12:13:14] <Jabberwock> LOL
[12:13:52] <ravenzz> tw2113 no way, crackers should be punished by paying a huge fine and social work or even jail
[12:14:04] <Jabberwock> They don't hire script kiddies. They hire the people that create the software that scriptkiddies use
[12:14:47] <Jabberwock> Most go to Levinworth
[12:14:47] <ravenzz> hackers maybe could pay by patching for free :p
[12:14:47] <Jabberwock> shutting up in 3…2
[12:14:48] <tw2113> ravenzz, i never said they'd be paid
[12:14:54] <wilkinsmc> fuck man. I'm just trying to allow people to submit forms to me on my page
[12:15:04] <wilkinsmc> and i've been trying to get wampserver to work fro like four hours
[12:15:12] <wilkinsmc> can't i just fucking insert a plugin and be done with this shit?
[12:15:22] <JBreit> only hackers/crackers i know that got paid working for the feds got jobs via black hat conventions
[12:15:25] <anthonym> wilkinsmc it isnt difficult.  do a few tutorials
[12:15:25] <Jabberwock> Go take a breather man
[12:15:28] <tw2113> you could have installed linux or purchased a macbook air in that time wilkinsmc
[12:15:30] <Jabberwock> You're probably over analyzing.
[12:15:31] <JBreit> the ones that got busted never made $ from their work
[12:15:33] <tw2113> and been better off either way
[12:15:35] <anthonym> wilkinsmc, or go take a shit, swim, a couple of cigarettes
[12:15:44] <Jabberwock> ^^
[12:15:57] <Jabberwock> Let your mind focus on something else. That's usually when it hits you
[12:16:06] <tw2113> wamp *shudder*
[12:16:15] <JBreit> yeah when i have issues its time to step away from the computer if i can't think of the answer
[12:16:21] <JBreit> then it comes t me while I am doing other shit
[12:16:29] <Jabberwock> It's funny how that works
[12:16:31] <Jabberwock> brb
[12:16:56] <JBreit> prt of it is your too dialed in to step away from what your seeing and looking at it from a clean perspective
[12:17:12] <JBreit> fortunately for me when i am not at my computer i think/see code in my head
[12:17:24] <JBreit> so typically i just read through the lines in my head and it stands out
[12:17:44] <JBreit> then i am typically like oh damn that was so simple why didn't i think of that?
[12:21:41] <anthonym> well hopefully wilkinsmc comes back, been helping him in pvt.
[12:30:46] <grant_vinson> So I have run into this "problem" on this site I am working on. When I create a div with javascript, set its innerHTML to some images and a close button; its then appended to a div that is already in the dom. This works fine.
[12:31:05] <grant_vinson> damn it. didn't mean to press enter. that definitely does not make sense haha
[12:31:32] <paxcoder> what's the most elegant way to .last().remove() from all nodes of class C?
[12:31:38] <Assimilater> grant_vinson: are you doing $('div') instead of $('<div>')? just from the gist I got from your question
[12:32:22] <paxcoder> anyone?
[12:32:27] <Assimilater> grant_vinson: second read nvm go ahead and finish :P
[12:32:29] <Jabberwock> $('.C').each(function() { $(this).last().remove(); });
[12:32:38] <grant_vinson> yea i am
[12:33:31] <grant_vinson> the problem i am having is that the div is appended to a div already in the dom in the complete step of an ajax call. I can't get my click function to fire off when the close button is clicked.
[12:33:54] <grant_vinson> I am guessing it is becuase it was added in the ajax complete step and the dom can't recognize it or something?
[12:34:15] <grant_vinson> if I place the click function inside the complete step, it works fine. Just wondering if there is a way to not have to put it in the complete step
[12:34:34] <Jabberwock> Or if there's only 1 class C, $('.C > *')
[12:35:50] <paxcoder> Jabberwock, that's what i thought. ok, thanks
[12:35:55] <Jabberwock> np
[12:36:25] <Assimilater> grant_vinson: ajax is run async, meaning your code outside of the complete function continues to execute while you're still connecting to the server. So when your code is adding a click handler the object doesn't exist yet. There really isn't a way to put it anywhere else unless you call another function inside your complete() step that takes care of it
[12:37:03] <Assimilater> grant_vinson: if you need more specific help try pasting a code example on jsfiddle, or a link to a live page?
[12:38:13] <grant_vinson> no that is what I thought was happening, I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a better way to do it. Thanks!
[12:40:43] <alaing> Jabberwock: by any chance were you at jquk conf :-D
[12:42:54] <PhonicUK> is there a way to invoke a method such that you change the value of 'this' ?
[12:45:39] <min|dvir|us-work> Anyone good with jQuery UI? I'm trying to get an ._on handler to fire after a ._trigger.
[12:48:38] <wilkinsmc> kk, so i submitted a form on my local server with action="comment.php" in the form
[12:48:50] <wilkinsmc> so the data should be in comment.php now, and i access it in mysql?
[12:50:00] <anthonym> wilkinsmc, msg me again
[12:50:04] <anthonym> Ill help you in private
[12:56:18] <paxcoder> Jabberwock, actually your example doesn't work. it removes all of them again
[12:56:49] <paxcoder> .children() are what i was looking for
[12:57:35] <paxcoder> well, there's still each, but in the function, .children need to be selected
[12:59:11] <anthonym> wilkin sorted :)
[12:59:26] <min|dvir|us-work> Can anyone help?
[13:01:17] <tw2113> min|dvir|us-work, it helps to actually provide what you're trying to make work and examples
[13:01:46] <min|dvir|us-work> I'll have an example ready soon, but for now, is there anyone that can help me get _on and _trigger working together?
[13:01:55] <min|dvir|us-work> I tried the same event name and it's not registering.
[13:21:52] <grkblood> how can I get the legend to continuously update the y value for where the crosshair is replaced without having to move my mouse to invoke the plothover event? http://jsfiddle.net/U9ryR/4/
[13:35:39] <boytoy> Anybody know how to replace the slide transition with fade transition at http://jsfiddle.net/jHvdr/ (SwipeJS aka. the world's most accurate touch slider)
[13:54:11] <atxq> I would like to delete an ID of an element by selecting it's ID
[13:54:59] <atxq> $("#id").removeAttr("id") does not seem to work
[13:57:30] <atxq> any suggestions?
[14:03:21] <colinwren> atxq: that should work
[14:03:51] <colinwren> atxq: post your code in a jsfiddle
[14:48:02] <atxq> thanks
[14:50:18] <atxq> I was removing the id, class, and data attribute, all at the same moment. The problem was that I needed to remove the id attribute last.
[14:50:47] <atxq> after moving it below the stack, things worked properly
[14:59:48] <Timme> hi all
[14:59:55] <Timme> anyone still awake for a minor bug fix?

[16:31:07] <vacetahanna> Hello I have a problem! :) I have two and morde draggable drop-areas. These can be fille with items from a list. But trough the areas are draggable, it sometimes happens, that they overlap.. and then both areas will get the item and not only the one in the most front.
[16:42:04] <acidjazz> whats a sweet way to do an ifinite loop ajax call until a certain flag is returned
[16:48:37] <Jagst3r15> any idea why the menu items are visible initally on mobile view? http://seamlessthemes.com/demo/lab/
[16:51:32] <Jagst3r15> withdrawn
[16:51:40] <Jagst3r15> was something really dumb
[16:57:27] <shoky> acidjazz: function sweet() { $.ajax(...).done(function(data) { if (data !== 'yay') sweet(); } ); }      sweet();
[16:57:49] <acidjazz> shoky: actually just async: false'ed a .ajax
[16:57:55] <acidjazz> bada boom
[16:58:05] <shoky> that's not a loop but ok
[16:58:51] <vacetahanna> please help! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16497873/dropping-an-element-only-into-the-droppable-that-is-in-front
[17:04:31] <shoky> vacetahanna: did you try  greedy: true
[17:04:33] <shoky> not greedy: 'true'
[17:07:17] <shoky> though i suppose the check would just be for a truthy value
[17:07:44] <shoky> yep.
[17:09:21] <shoky> hmm
[17:10:06] <vacetahanna> shoky:yes I tried greedy: 'true' and greedy: true
[17:10:31] <shoky> yeah i see now that's only for nested droppables anyway
[17:10:53] <vacetahanna> shoky: the problem is, that the drop: function gets called twice
[17:11:13] <shoky> vacetahanna: yeah, i see that
[17:12:01] <vacetahanna> shoky: I also tried it with some hover or MouseOver hacks, but it still triggers all overlapped areas
[17:22:26] <Zapy> Hi guys, i have a web-site with a div that gets loaded when DOM is ready, but in this div i would like to have a IMG that can refresh that div that gets loaded when DOM is ready, i have gotten it to work so when pressing anywhere in the div it gets refreshed but the img just dosnt want to work, anyone have any ideas? site is www.warzone.nu:8080 its the right server-status refresh button
[17:35:19] <shoky> Zapy: change this  $('#srvrefresh').click(function() {    to:      $('#servers').on('click', '#srvrefresh', function() {
[17:35:55] <shoky> you're re-writing the #srvrefresh button so the previous event-handler gets removed
[17:36:49] <Zapy> ofc... thx
[17:38:03] <Zapy> works like a charm, ty shoky
[17:38:19] <shoky> np
[17:41:13] <Zapy> i was thinkig of adding a refresh button for every game-type section as well, do i need to repeat this function for every each or is there any simpler way to do that?
[17:42:30] <Zapy> +shoky*
[17:43:56] <reed1> Zapy: Use a class instead of an ID, and have the "load url" be encoded in data on the html
[17:47:42] <Zapy> reed1 could you explain that a little bit more?
[17:47:48] <Zapy> if you have time
[17:48:00] <Zapy> or the energy
[17:48:01] <Zapy> =P
[17:48:31] <reed1> Zapy: Ya sure
[17:49:01] <reed1> if you want several buttons to be set at once, you use a class instead of an id
[17:49:33] <reed1> the only part of that function that changes depending on which button is hit is the load url, right?
[17:49:40] <Zapy> ah, you meant it like that, well each refresh button would only refresh that game-type
[17:50:10] <Zapy> ah yes
[17:50:20] <Zapy> i get it now
[17:50:42] <reed1> Zapy: Cool :)
[17:50:54] <Zapy> at least i get the idea, now i only have to do it :P
[17:51:58] <Zapy> at least with the class, but what did you mean with the "load url" reed1?
[17:52:32] <Zapy> nvr mind
[17:53:04] <Zapy> i was thinking on the actual first-load of the div, but clearly you meant the load when hitting the refresh buttons
[17:53:16] <reed1> Right
[17:53:22] <reed1> you're going to split that one url up into one url per game
[17:53:39] <reed1> or maybe use an http parameter to only fetch a piece of that pie
[17:54:24] <Zapy> its actually only one script that fetches the data now so i thought i would just fetch the actuall piece and update the div
[17:55:14] <reed1> And how will you "fetch the actual piece"? By requesting all of it and only slicing out the chunk to update?
[17:56:09] <Zapy> i guess, i wouldnt be able to, i think, to split it up, but thats maybe easier than spliting the actuall data
[17:56:41] <reed1> if you're always going to grab all the info from the server, why only visually update some of it?
[17:57:08] <Zapy> and it would reduce resources if i split the collecting of data instead
[17:57:23] <Zapy> yeah, ill try and split it instead
[17:57:57] <reed1> yes, if your aim is to reduce resources, it must be a different call to the back-end for each piece of data
[17:58:15] <reed1> a dfferent call per game type
[17:59:03] <Zapy> yeah, first time load all, after that either refresh everything with the refresh button on the Servers header or just for the actuall game-type
[17:59:33] <reed1> aye
[17:59:59] <Zapy> i was thinking on adding another button later as well that would toggle a auto-refresh script
[18:00:41] <reed1> also cool :)
[18:02:31] <Zapy> and i need to start using cookies so when ppl close that thing over the server-status pane, it actully gets removed, and now when i think about that i think ill just remove the context and keep the header instead, just change the X to a arrown up/down instead
[18:02:51] <Zapy> i wonder if freenode getting ddoes or something o_O
[18:02:54] <Zapy> +is
[18:03:03] <Zapy> ddosed*
[18:03:07] <ravenzz> yes it is
[18:03:23] <Zapy> seems like it, damn parts and joins everywhere :o
[18:03:49] <ravenzz> didn't you get the notice from the ircops?
[18:04:32] <ravenzz> these cute script kiddies
[18:04:46] <Zapy> ravenzz no
[18:04:46] <Zapy> srsly
[18:04:46] <Zapy> ravenzz what did it say?
[18:05:15] <ravenzz> it is been DDoSed for a while now
[18:05:32] <ravenzz> I had the time to get drunk go out and come back home
[18:05:52] <ravenzz> and someone is still DDoSsing their servers
[18:06:08] <Zapy> :D
[18:07:10] <Zapy> yeah well, time for bed then, reed1 ty again, ill return, hopefully with something similar to what you would have done :)
[18:26:52] <xylogicz> looking to hire a jquery designer
[18:31:18] <ctienrsg> xylogicz: what is the problem?
[18:32:13] <xylogicz> It is a small problem. I am using a SaaS solution and I cannot edit any files, So I want to use my SaaS's form to be hosted remotely and work functionaly so it would like custom
[18:32:29] <xylogicz> i have all the ideas, need the form in bootstrap.
[18:34:29] <ctienrsg> Sorry, cannot help there
[18:34:59] <ctienrsg> If it is a small problem, why not learn the skills? Or you just be patient a bit, there are many humans online
[18:41:44] <xylogicz> ctienrsg
[18:41:46] <xylogicz> you are right
[18:41:50] <xylogicz> inspired me to learn more just now
[18:41:51] <xylogicz> thank you,
[18:42:32] <ctienrsg> U have a good reason here to increase ur skills :)
[18:43:25] <RNT> hi, can somebody tell me what`s wrong with this:
[18:43:28] <RNT> $pht = "'" + $('#ph').css("top") + "'";
[18:44:25] <ctienrsg> is mixing ' " ok?
[18:44:59] <Kneecaps> Try var $pht = "'" + $('#ph').css("top") + "'";
[18:45:03] <RNT> when i alert the value, it giving me: '200px', exactly like this,
[18:45:41] <RNT> Kneecaps, but is not the same?
[18:46:19] <RNT> redefining the var?
[18:46:24] <Kneecaps> RNT, in js you have to declare variables with var. Unless you're just changing it
[18:47:12] <RNT> no, the vars are ok, an alert returns: '200px', but if i use rigt after alert:
[18:47:29] <RNT> $('#ph').css('top', $pht ) ;
[18:47:34] <RNT> won't perform
[18:48:14] <Kneecaps> What about just... $pht = $('#ph').css("top");
[18:48:14] <RNT> also, if i reassign $pht = '200px' and run $('#ph').css('top', $pht ) ; it will be fine
[18:48:26] <RNT> i tryed that one too
[18:48:27] <Kneecaps> Why are you adding the single quotation marks?
[18:49:00] <RNT> because $('#ph').css('top', $pht ) ; wants to be like $('#ph').css('top', '200px' ) ;
[18:50:00] <Kneecaps> The .css function returned a string, So wrapping it in single quotes just appends and prepends them as actual characters in the string.
[18:50:12] <RNT> and anyway, i had just 2 variants, with quota and without, i tried both
[18:50:24] <RNT> let me try again
[18:51:03] <Kneecaps> $pht = $('#ph').css("top"); and $('#ph').css('top', $pht); should work
[18:51:07] <thujone> the single quotes is not right
[18:51:53] <Kneecaps> and if it's the first time you're assigning $pht, you'll need to make it var $pht =
[18:52:45] <RNT> is working now
[18:53:06] <RNT> i don't know why, bcz first time i tried without quota
[18:53:09] <RNT> o_O
[18:53:42] <RNT> only when i saw won't work whitout quota, i thought i might add it
[18:53:50] <RNT> thank you very much
[18:54:07] <RNT> case closed :)
[18:54:19] <Kneecaps> No problem. Glad to help. =]
[18:55:08] <thujone> that quote thing you tried -- there's never a time you would ever have to do something like that
[18:59:00] <vinex08> can you guys give me a link on how to create a simple content slider. Simple!
[19:59:58] <elefone> hey, i need help writing my first plugin. I have a single function, let's call it foo() that i'm adding to the query prototype since you're not supposed to pollute the namespace, and it basically just delegates work since it only calls the right method based on what the user entered. if the functions that are called by foo() take parameters, would it a good approach be to pass an array with the function name & the appropriate
[19:59:59] <elefone> parameters to foo()?
[20:05:48] <thujone> you would pass multiple args, but probably not as a single array
[20:06:32] <thujone> why can't the caller just call the right method directly?
[20:06:53] <thujone> elefone
[20:07:18] <elefone> hmm
[20:07:34] <elefone> you mean just in within <script> tags?
[20:07:58] <elefone> instead of calling this "delegator function" within script tags
[20:08:48] <thujone> or a behavior bound to a selector
[20:09:10] <thujone> sorry, maybe i don't know enough about plugins to respond right
[20:09:22] <elefone> @thujone np
[20:09:48] <elefone> i just want to compare two <inputs>
[20:10:17] <thujone> what namespace are you worried about polluting?
[20:10:41] <elefone> the $ namespace
[20:10:51] <elefone> i read that you should only extend it once
[20:11:04] <elefone> so instead of $.methodOne, $methodTwo, etc.
[20:11:30] <elefone> you just have $.myOnlyFunction, and you would pass the appropriate parameters to myOnlyFunction to call private functions
[20:11:30] <tharkun> I need to input a series of data using a barcode scanner what widget is the best suited for this?
[20:11:54] <elefone> including the appropriate function name
[20:12:11] <thujone> yeah, i guess that makes sense
[20:13:01] <thujone> i guess sometimes the plugin would have to determine what private functions would get called
[20:13:20] <thujone> if you're publicly calling private functions, it's not really private, i guess
[20:13:30] <elefone> hmm true lol
[20:13:31] <thujone> i guess it's all just imaginary anyway
[20:13:36] <elefone> poor word choice on my part
[20:14:27] <thujone> you might have a plugin option called 'type' that maps out to different private functions
[20:26:27] <Dys> I'm trying to make "selected" divs behave differently than non-selected divs. It's about 80% working; http://jsfiddle.net/xLgTd/
[20:27:46] <Dys> The selected div should stay at full opacity until another div is selected, but that's not working quite right.
[20:33:20] <vinex08> can you guys give me a link on how to create a simple content slider. Simple!
[21:34:37] <myndzi> what is better practice? $('.class') or $('#id').find('.class') ?
[21:34:46] <myndzi> (ignoring that they can be combined)
[21:35:06] <myndzi> (and assuming that both are equally valid)
[21:37:41] <Guest52187> Is there any wya, that when the page loads, it only loads up the first tab, and it'll load the 2nd tab if you click on it only, else, it won't load it: http://jsfiddle.net/BM973/92/
[21:38:47] <moeloubani> you can make the other tabs display:none by default and then make them show, alternately you can append the html when someone clicks on the tab title
[21:40:39] <moeloubani> myndzi i would think the one with the class directly would be faster but dont quote me on that, my reasoning being that it finds the class right away whereas the other one finds the ID and then finds the class anyways so its just an extra step with the ID
[21:40:52] <moeloubani> as to which one is a better practice im not sure, id assume the one that is the fastest
[21:40:55] <myndzi> that's kind of what i was thinking, but i also found something useful
[21:41:00] <myndzi> http://www.sitepoint.com/efficient-jquery-selectors/
[21:42:13] <Dys> Does anyone know why the divs with changed classes aren't behaving properly? http://jsfiddle.net/xLgTd/2/
[21:43:06] <moeloubani> why not something like $('#id .class')
[21:43:48] <myndzi> because that wasn't the question :P
[21:44:15] <Dys> moeloubani: Almost right after posting the link, I think I noticed that the removeClass isn't actually removing the class.
[21:45:53] <moeloubani> lol but dont the two do the same thign myndzi
[21:46:46] <myndzi> that's why i was asking which is better
[21:46:49] <myndzi> :P
[21:46:52] <myndzi> for the same usage, i mean
[21:47:03] <myndzi> i was just verifying some information really, but then i found that site which answered my question
[21:47:14] <moeloubani> but wait i dont see the answer on that site
[21:47:30] <myndzi> not exactly, but it describes why one is good in one case and the other in another case
[21:47:55] <myndzi> for example, if you're selecting something that there is a lot of, it can be better to reduce the set you're selecting from first by using $('foo').find('bar')
[21:48:02] <myndzi> but if not, it's probably best to just use $('bar')
[21:48:26] <moeloubani> yeah but you can limit it by doing $('#ID .class')
[21:48:33] <moeloubani> instead of doing .find
[21:48:37] <myndzi> except that actually selects all of .class first
[21:48:41] <myndzi> then reduces it to #id .class
[21:48:56] <moeloubani> ahhh ok i get ya
[21:49:54] <Dys> Alright, so there's two problems: removeClass isn't working correctly, and the newly changed classes aren't adhering to the css.
[21:50:13] <myndzi> sounds like the same problem
[21:50:19] <myndzi> namely, the selectors are wrong
[21:50:25] <myndzi> probably somewhere up the dom
[21:50:36] <myndzi> check that the selector you are calling removeClass on actually contains what you expect
[22:05:35] <moeloubani> didnt know that myndzi about the right to left but i just read up on it...thanks! :)
[22:20:57] <Dys> Got the removeClass to work, but the newly classed divs won't adhere to the css. http://jsfiddle.net/xLgTd/5/
[22:30:50] <Mage> Dys: your .css('opacity' overrides the css
[22:30:51] <Mage> fyi
[22:31:38] <Mage> http://jsfiddle.net/xLgTd/18/
[22:35:00] <Dys> Mage: I was definitely overcomplicating things; thanks.
[22:37:29] <Mage> Dys: whenever i run into a script where i have a lot of problems with no clear solutions, i start simplifying it
[22:37:37] <Mage> then i understand it better, then i discover the problems
[22:39:23] <Dys> Ah; sound advice. You can probably already tell, but, I'm quite new at this, and I tend to do worse as the day gets later. xD
[22:39:56] <Mage> s'all good
[22:48:41] <tharkun> Good $(date) I'm trying to understand how jquery-ui works so I downloaded it and began by looking at the files. If I run them with file:///... works fine, but if I run them through a web server I get $ no defined What caveat should I look into?
[22:58:00] <moeloubani> are you sure you have jquery loaded tharkun
[23:01:41] <tharkun> moeloubani: Yea, I just realized the path had a missing ../ so jquery was not actually loaded. Thanks
