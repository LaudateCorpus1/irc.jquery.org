[16:16:00] <relipse> Does anyone know how PHP automatically turns form elements named foobar[] into a a php array? How do I do this on the client side before form submission?
[19:22:40] <SkitsVicious> yes i know how.
[19:22:54] <SkitsVicious> but i also know why you don't want to know.
[19:23:15] <SkitsVicious> check document.form.elements
[19:23:39] <SkitsVicious> do this in your F12
[19:23:45] <SkitsVicious> so you can see live what's in there.
[19:31:48] <robertmaxrees> they already got help in another channel :)
