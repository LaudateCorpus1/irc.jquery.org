[20:13:16] <\Kalascus> Should I use an arrow function for a $.each() that doesn't need to return a value?
[20:14:15] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't return values out of $.each() anyway :)
[20:14:20] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you can do that.
[20:15:43] <\Kalascus> I just mean is it worse to use an arrow function with a $.each because it inherently returns, or should I just keep it as a normal anonymous function
[20:16:19] <robertmaxrees> nope.  arrow functions only do the return if it's a one-liner.  even then, shouldn't be an issue.
[20:17:14] <\Kalascus> Okay thanks
