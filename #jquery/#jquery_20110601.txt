[01:00:41] <Hornet-> has anyone used a custom handler for recaptcha, and how do you hook it if so?
[01:00:46] <Hornet-> something is meddling with my code

[01:02:38] <loki_irl> Hi ,  I'm using $.getJSON(url), when debugging (firebug) i seem to get only a 303 error back.
[01:02:43] <Beltechs> ah... i found firebug will try
[01:03:31] <loki_irl> any ideas? i have the code working off a webserver, but now i'm just testing locally , just loaded html file via firefox.
[01:04:34] <NodoLibero> just guessing: POST/GET issues?
[01:04:48] <Beltechs> no float in firebug
[01:06:03] <loki_irl> Nodolibero: yes but loading the url up in the browser return the JSON data, so not sure what I'm doing wrong :(
[01:07:08] <Hornet-> right, found the root of the issue
[01:07:59] <Hornet-> although not sure of the exact solution ... basically recaptcha has its own event bound to the form
[01:08:07] <Hornet-> how can I prevent that firing / remove it?
[01:08:41] <NodoLibero> loki_irl: post the code and meanwhile check server logs
[01:09:08] <loki_irl> ok will do.

[02:44:06] <anger> Hi!
[02:44:24] <ChristianAdamski> Hey. I'm using .text() to get an address and hand this over to GoogleMaps. It locates that at [0,0] some in the ocean. If I instead type the exact same string, it works. Doesn't text() produce strings?
[02:44:51] <markj> text does return a string yes
[02:45:30] <ChristianAdamski> But how can this produce different results? I'm close to crying like a little girl :(
[02:45:39] <ravenzz> lol
[02:45:53] <ravenzz> can you provide a live example?

[02:47:56] <shomon> hi, how can I show progress, just using the core jquery?
[02:48:39] <markj> anger use setDate
[02:48:48] <markj> .datepicker('setDate',date);
[02:49:13] <clorith> when using .datepicker on an element that is auto-populated on page load, how can I stop the datepicker from triggering when the page is loaded? (Right now it adds an ugly big white frame on the left side of my screen for some reason if the datepicker field is pre-populated)
[02:49:18] <shomon> by progress I mean some revolving image or a bar getting longer...
[02:49:48] <ravenzz> markj i suppose he would get the date from the datepicker and set it as value of his input
[02:51:36] <ximi> markj, just check if the input you're using the datepicker on has an input or not if($('.yourInput').val() === '') { load the datepicker } else { don't load it and do something else if you want to }
[02:51:58] <ximi> sorry I meant check if it has a value, not input
[02:52:09] <crashev> hello, how to uncheck a checkbox, tryed $('input[name="data[Answersvalid][]"]').removeAttr("checked"); ,but it does not work ?
[02:53:17] <ximi> shomon: do you want to show the actual progress of something or just a generic loading/progress image that shows until something completes (an ajax request as an example)
[02:54:07] <anger> markj: ok, makes things a bit complicated
[02:54:48] <anger> what I have done is I used html5-elements and use jquery datepicker only on browsers that don't understand html5 :)
[02:55:07] <shomon> I don't mind... ximi I'm a total jquery loser. whenever I try and do something with me, computers break
[02:55:16] <shomon> walls fall down...
[02:55:18] <shomon> etc
[02:55:44] <shomon> so yeah a loading image would be great :)
[02:56:23] <ximi> You can use one of these: http://www.preloaders.net/ or http://www.ajaxload.info/ to generate one
[02:57:28] <shomon> ok ximi just checking those out
[02:57:32] <ximi> then you just show/hide the image or an element containing it (or that has it assigned as background-image) whenever you need to
[02:58:02] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. How do you trigger the resize event for the window?
[02:58:23] <ximi> so, in case of an ajax request as an example $('#loading').show(); $.ajax(settings).complete(function() { $('#loading').hide() });
[02:58:56] <ximi> Whirl3d it should be $(window).trigger('resize');
[02:59:03] <dr0id> http://thrivingkings.com/formly/
[02:59:31] <Whirl3d> ximi, thanks for the reply, but I get the error (object window has no method "resize")

[03:00:25] <ximi> crashdev: what you did should work, look here: http://jsfiddle.net/VGuVM/ , but I suspect there might be something wrong with your selector

[03:24:35] <rccc> hello, i have a qustion about event
[03:25:39] <rccc> i put an mouseenter event in a div, but all children if this div seems to fire the events too, i think this is what they call event capturing
[03:25:45] <rccc> is there a way to prevent this ?
[03:26:54] <xec> rccc: maybe you want stopPropagation.. show us your code?
[03:27:51] <xec> on second thought, i might have misread
[03:28:39] <xec> rccc: hav you read up on http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[03:30:17] <GreyTrilby> is there a jquery function that will dynamically escape a string? I have a text box (using ckEditor) which posts html as part of a form, but the double quotes are not being escaped or converted to '&quot' - is there a function I can use to escape the string I then get via 'serialise'
[03:31:04] <rccc> http://jsfiddle.net/rccc/aUuVt/11/
[03:31:31] <rccc> xec: thanks, but eventPropagation is concerning the parent of the element, not the children ?
[03:31:50] <GreyTrilby> crashev - I think you need to look for $(':input:checked')
[03:33:40] <xec> rccc: yes, i misunderstood you the first time around there :) - where do you bind mouseenter in that code?
[03:34:12] <cesconix> hi all, is there a way for rotate div element?
[03:34:24] <cesconix> also for ie7+
[03:34:39] <ximi> cesconix: this is rather tricky, especially if you can't usee css3
[03:34:47] <ximi> you'll need use canvas or svg
[03:35:01] <ximi> if I recall there is a plugin, but it's quite performance hungry
[03:35:20] <cesconix> mh
[03:35:21] <seutje> u can rotate in IE
[03:35:27] <seutje> all the way back to 6
[03:35:34] <seutje> ?css3please @ cesconix

[03:35:47] <bot-t> cesconix, CSS3 Please! The Cross-Browser CSS3 Rule Generator - http://css3please.com/
[03:35:59] <ximi> cesconix: here is the plugin I was talking about: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-rotate/
[03:36:15] <cesconix> ximi, yes
[03:36:37] <cesconix> seutje, thanks!
[03:36:47] <rccc> ok, think i have it :) thanks :)
[03:36:53] <seutje> heh, why does that use canvas for browsers that support regular transform shizzle?
[03:37:16] <cesconix> filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Matrix(/* IE6–IE9 */
[03:37:17] <cesconix>                      M11=0.9914448613738104, M12=-0.13052619222005157,M21=0.13052619222005157, M22=0.9914448613738104, sizingMethod='auto expand');
[03:37:18] <cesconix> wow
[03:37:45] <ximi> rccc: you basically want to prevent propagation in the capture phase of the event, the problem is that ie doesn't support the capture phase, thus it is a widely unused feature of javascript
[03:39:15] <ximi> you can preventPropagation for the same event on the children and the parent shouldn't be triggered
[03:46:27] <GreyTrilby> OK - a few quickies - if I have the html entity '&quot' in a form field, why does serialize() remove everything after it?
[03:48:24] <GreyTrilby> \me

[03:56:45] <mdsdss> dragoonis ?
[03:57:43] <seutje> a quick google suggests using a z-index over 2147483647 might cause problems on some browsers
[03:57:52] <seutje> where the element would position itself behind everything
[03:57:58] <mdsdss> Sorry I should rephrase this, what's the safest cross-browser z-index value ?
[03:58:04] <seutje> 214748364
[03:58:07] <seutje> 2147483647*
[03:58:20] <seutje> oh, safest? auto?
[03:58:39] <hrwath> safest maximum you meant?
[03:58:45] <Tant102> 0 exists for everyone.
[03:58:53] <seutje> http://www.puidokas.com/max-z-index/
[03:59:10] <seutje> looks like safari3 has a lower limit
[03:59:16] <mdsdss> seutje : Yeah that's what I thought. Is that supported by most of the common browsers?  I remember safari had something lower
[03:59:51] <hrwath> come on, how many elements you have... ;-)
[04:00:00] <mdsdss> ahh great thanks.
[04:00:35] <mdsdss> hrwath : 2147483648 :D
[04:00:42] <hrwath> shoot.
[04:00:50] <mdsdss> jk
[04:01:09] <seutje> using containers, u could cleverly avoid having a need for that manu different z-indexes
[04:01:45] <seutje> many*
[04:02:56] <mdsdss> Yeah I couldnt remember what the value was, and I remember not all browsers supported a high value (just couldn't remember which browsers it was and what was the safest value).
[04:02:58] <seutje> nice, now even my stable chrome is acting up -_-
[04:03:20] <seutje> mdsdss: don't think I've even gone over 9000
[04:04:31] <mdsdss> Also, is there a recomended site that is tracking browser usage ? I.e IE6 60% etc...
[04:07:23] <seutje> mdsdss: their accuracy and relevancy is often the cause for much debate, it really depends on your user-base
[04:07:45] <seutje> I usually use http://gs.statcounter.com/ as a general line though
[04:08:20] <mdsdss> I was looking at http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp but didn't know whether it was a credible source.
[04:08:27] <mdsdss> I'll check it out.
[04:08:42] <seutje> mdsdss: no sir, that is not a credible source
[04:08:45] <ryrych> why does .fadeIn() not work with <object> but .show() does?
[04:09:19] <seutje> mdsdss: "W3Schools is a website for people with an interest for web technologies. These people are more interested in using alternative browsers than the average user."
[04:09:24] <dytrivedi> Lampoon: seen seutje
[04:09:24] <Lampoon> seutje was last seen in #jquery 5 sec ago saying 'mdsdss: "W3Schools is a website for people with an interest for web technologies. These people are more interested in using alternative browsers than the average user."'.

[04:37:50] <grid_> sean`: yes i have seen a lot of this scripts, but how could you get the new div content from a database? so people can't find in in their source, so you could also update it in a database probably

[04:39:22] <innociv> Alright... this is bending and breaking my mind.  I'm using localStorage for a chat to save a users logs, like you would on IRC.  People have hit the 5mb limit in chrome and it's giving them errors.  So... I need to dumb their oldest data, and delete it.  Luckily, I do have a date in the key to find the oldest.  Keys look like "yourID-othersName-month-year".  How can I.... look through these keys to find the oldest year, and oldest mon
[04:39:22] <innociv> th, then get all keys with that month and year at the end(both to select data, and to remove those keys to free up space)?

[06:39:36] <Deele> question, I have a <select> with values, and I have <div> containing <sans>'s, like "<span>val1</span>, <span>val2</span>" etc, I need to remove all <select> values, that is not inside my $('div').find('span') list, how to do that?

[06:39:59] <miketaylr> heh, so true
[06:40:06] <mazzachre> How can I bind something to the first button of every row in a table?
[06:40:34] <mazzachre> table button:nth(0) binds first button in the entire table :)
[06:40:46] <miketaylr> tr button:nth(0) ?
[06:40:51] <ralphholzmann> $("table tr td:first")
[06:41:01] <ben_alman> mazzachre, you'll want to use .each
[06:41:04] <ablomen> mazzachre, $("tr").each(function ( ) { $("button:tr").bind(yourFunc); });
[06:41:07] <ralphholzmann> or $("tr td:first")
[06:41:08] <ablomen> :first
[06:41:12] <crimlo> why did the Norwegian kill his dog?
[06:41:20] <ablomen> (instead of :tr)
[06:41:30] <ben_alman> $('table tr').each(function(){ var firstButton = $(this).find('button:first'); /* etc */ });
[06:41:31] <ralphholzmann> crimlo: I DONT KNOW. WHY
[06:41:49] <ben_alman> the each will loop over every TR explicitly
[06:42:02] <crimlo> because its was his father (luke i am your father... get it).... muahhahaahah
[06:42:06] <crimlo> it**
[06:42:11] <miketaylr> haha
[06:42:36] <ralphholzmann> mazzachre: have you tried out any selectors in your firebug or chrome console?
[06:42:38] <ben_alman> i'm trying to think if it's possible to just select the buttons you want with just a string selector, but i can't think of a way
[06:42:48] <ralphholzmann> ben_alman: I believe it is possible
[06:43:13] <ablomen> give every first button a class and selecting that?
[06:43:22] <ablomen> or is that cheating?

[06:55:14] <ralphholzmann> couldn't figure it out
[06:55:27] <ralphholzmann> ended up having to wrap shit with overflow : hidden
[06:55:31] <ralphholzmann> felt yucky.
[06:55:52] <ben_alman> i'll tell you
[06:55:59] <ben_alman> i've hardly done any css in the last year
[06:56:03] <ben_alman> and i LOVE MY LIFE
[06:56:25] <ralphholzmann> lol
[06:56:32] <ralphholzmann> I love css
[06:57:04] <joikus> you guys, I'm using jquery selectmenu - how can I preselect something through code?
[06:57:13] <ben_alman> css is cool but browser support is UNCOOL
[06:57:14] <joikus> instead of manually clicking to open the dropdown and selecting
[06:57:30] <erichynds> joikus: i'm guessing you set the selected attribute on the option tag
[06:57:36] <systemfault> How can anyone love CSS? :)
[06:57:38] <seutje> ralphholzmann: about to just remove my border, what the shit in a container with a background & padding and call it a day >:|
[06:57:57] <seutje> s/what/wrap
[06:58:10] <ralphholzmann> seutje: someday standards will work correctly
[06:58:13] <amirite> i want to queue animations but the animations apply to different dom elements, can i do that with jquery or should i implement it myself
[06:58:22] <ben_alman> erichynds, i'd say you "set" an attribute on an element, while you "define" an attribute in a tag
[06:58:28] <ben_alman> but that still doesn't seem right
[06:58:33] <ben_alman> hmmn
[06:58:35] <ralphholzmann> amirite: what do you mean by "que" ?
[06:58:39] <seutje> ralphholzmann: don't patronize me ;)
[06:58:48] <ralphholzmann> as in, the second animation starts after the first has completed?
[06:58:58] <joikus> erichynds didn't work :/
[06:59:03] <djQuery> ben_alman: there has to be some way to be able to do a live\delegte on that
[06:59:11] <ben_alman> djQuery, on what?
[06:59:16] <erichynds> ben_alman: how about "declare" ?
[06:59:24] <djQuery> first button in a tr
[06:59:27] <ben_alman> erichynds, i like it. that's the correct word, for sure
[06:59:41] <joikus> erichynds, it didn't work, looks like this: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/selectmenu/index.html
[07:00:00] <Deele> I have two arrays, [a,b,c] and [a,b], how to diff them to get [c]?
[07:00:17] <erichynds> joikus: are you trying to programatically change the selected state of an option after the widget has been built?
[07:00:19] <amirite> does jquery 1.6 support any kind of global queue
[07:00:21] <orolo> anyone use backbone.js?
[07:00:29] <joikus> erichynds yep
[07:00:42] <ben_alman> Deele, is this just for visual reasons or to get a new array?
[07:00:52] <ben_alman> like, do you actually want a new, usable array
[07:00:52] <erichynds> joikus: ah. if it doesn't have an api for that, you will probably have to destroy the widget/re-create it, or hack it on yourself
[07:01:10] <ben_alman> erichynds, extend!
[07:01:14] <ben_alman> not hack!
[07:01:17] <ben_alman> :P
[07:01:23] <erichynds> :)
[07:01:25] <systemfault> Add a feature :)
[07:01:51] <systemfault> Deele: There's no built-in way
[07:01:55] <Deele> ben_alman, in reality, I have a list of "allowed" strings in jQ selector, I want to remove all <select> <option> that values are not in "allowed" list
[07:02:08] <EM03> anyone here ever use cappucinno or sproutcore, is there anything like that in the jquery world?
[07:02:26] <amirite> nobody knows
[07:02:27] <amirite> grr
[07:02:29] <ben_alman> Deele, so you want to filter your select options
[07:02:30] <amirite> stupids
[07:02:44] <Deele> ben_alman, yeah, feels like filter
[07:02:56] <ben_alman> erichynds, can you suggest a good way for Deele to filter his options? i know you made that multi-select ui widget
[07:03:00] <ben_alman> that did filtering, right?
[07:03:11] <djQuery> Deele: what is the format of "not allowed" string?
[07:03:52] <erichynds> i did
[07:04:02] <erichynds> is there a fiddle Deele?
[07:04:29] <Deele> djQuery, "allowed" strings are now in selector $('div').find('span') checking against $('select option').each... this.val ...
[07:05:13] <systemfault> He could make a temporary object with all the allowed keywords as keys, and then only use .filter and check if the value is in the "object"
[07:06:31] <JKarsrud> hey guys
[07:07:04] <JKarsrud> I haven't done any JS in a long time, and I'm currently implementing something that needs to use jquery ui autocomplete
[07:08:06] <JKarsrud> my problem is that it stops searching through my array after one char, and I don't see whyâ€¦
[07:08:09] <Michael> ajpiano, We noticed jQuery 1.6.1's $.getJSON() sends the Accept header in a different format. Do you know if there is a way to have it revert?
[07:08:18] <JKarsrud> http://jsfiddle.net/XTddZ/1/
[07:08:29] <Michael> 1.4.2 had   Accept: application/json; q=1.0, text/javascript, */*, and 1.6.1 has Accept: application/json; q=1.0, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
[07:08:50] <Michael> Which is totally valid
[07:08:56] <Michael> just wondering if there is a way to change that
[07:09:22] <ben_alman> Michael, i see this in thge 1.6.1 source:
[07:09:23] <ben_alman> s.accepts[ s.dataTypes[0] ] + ( s.dataTypes[ 0 ] !== "*" ? ", */*; q=0.01" : "" )
[07:09:54] <ben_alman> which makes me thing if s.dataTypes[ 0 ] !== "*" it won't add the , */*; q=0.01 bit
[07:09:59] <ben_alman> not sure exactly what that means
[07:10:03] <ben_alman> but i'm looking @ it
[07:10:04] <Michael> hmm
[07:10:10] <Michael> Me too. Thank you
[07:10:17] <ben_alman> it's the only place i see 0.01 in the source
[07:10:20] <ben_alman> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js
[07:10:28] <Michael> Sweet, thanks
[07:10:49] <Michael> They're both valid but the new one seems to mess up our server into sending HTML
[07:11:03] <Michael> So it's a server side fix. I was just hoping there was a quick fix before we involve the backend teams
[07:11:12] <Michael> so we can keep working
[07:11:13] <ryrych> $("#container").children().wrap("<div></div>"); - what is the most elegant way to hide these wrapping DIVs in the same chain?
[07:11:20] <ben_alman> and the only difference is the "; q=0.01" at the end?
[07:11:28] <Michael> yeah that's what it looks like
[07:12:02] <ben_alman> $("#container").children().wrap("<div style="display:none"/>");
[07:12:21] <ryrych> bed_alman: sure! :)
[07:12:33] <ben_alman> $("#container").children().wrap( $("<div/>").hide() ); // not great imo
[07:12:42] <ben_alman> but both will work
[07:13:24] <ben_alman> i'd do the 1st
[07:13:32] <Michael> ben_alman, wonder how we tell it to send *
[07:13:44] <Michael> digging
[07:13:46] <djQuery> ben_alman: when someone was asking earlier for the first button in each row I was thinking someing like this. http://jsfiddle.net/2NbwW/
[07:13:46] <ryrych> ben_alman: 1st fits my needs, thanks :)
[07:14:06] <djQuery> ben_alman: but of course my selector is still off
[07:14:51] <ben_alman> Michael, set s.dataTypes[0] to "*/*" maybe?
[07:16:14] <Michael> yeah looking into how to do that. I see where s is defined
[07:16:23] <Michael> Looking where we'd pass it from $.getJSON()
[07:16:27] <Michael> er, to
[07:17:02] <Michael> ?getJSON
[07:17:03] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[07:17:12] <Michael> aha
[07:17:16] <gibnibit> http://www.pastebin.ca/2073236 -- having an issue with IE and dropdown lists -- its consistently obtaining the last value of the dropdown list, not the selected value. Nor is it grabbing all of them, it is omitting the ID on the final dropdown, but appending the value. Any suggestions on where to start debugging?
[07:17:57] <amirite> is the fxqueue plugin deprecated or still no global queue internally implemented
[07:19:53] <Michael> ?ajaxSetup
[07:19:53] <bot-t> jQuery.ajaxSetup(options): Set default values for future Ajax requests. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[07:20:44] <ben_alman> Michael, this is the only way i can see to do this
[07:20:45] <ben_alman> $.ajax({url: '/test', dataType: '*', accepts: {'*': 'application/json; q=1.0, text/javascript, */*'}});
[07:20:55] <Michael> Yeah. Thank you Ben
[07:21:01] <Michael> We're gonna have to fix our server side config
[07:21:03] <ben_alman> but that's probably not going to parse the data properly
[07:21:08] <Michael> right
[07:21:17] <ben_alman> at least it should set the correct header
[07:21:45] <ben_alman> or, the desired header, at least
[07:21:48] <Deele> I read in those strings in object array with value 1, iterated over options, if value was not 1 in object, removed them :)
[07:21:50] <ben_alman> i have no idea what's "correct"
[07:22:53] <Rost> May i ask general JS question too in here?:P
[07:22:57] <ben_alman> Rost, yes
[07:23:28] <mipo> hi
[07:25:02] <ben_alman> Michael, in what version was it sending the prior header?
[07:25:04] <Rost> Oke I made this http://jsfiddle.net/ but it doesnt do exacly what I was thinking it should do. I was expecting that it would make every vertical line a different color but the colors are all the same. Did i do something wrong?
[07:25:37] <Michael> Let me look
[07:25:42] <ben_alman> jQuery 1.5 saw a complete ajax rewrite
[07:25:51] <Michael> I see
[07:26:09] <Michael> Well the format is definitely valid according to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html
[07:26:27] <systemfault> Rost: If you want help, we'll need a full link. :/
[07:27:09] <amitev> hi all
[07:27:29] <mipo> hi
[07:27:38] <mipo> I have a sortable part
[07:27:52] <mipo> for managing menus
[07:27:53] <ben_alman> fwiw Michael in 1.4.2 i see "Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*" and in 1.6.1 i see "Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01"
[07:27:59] <ben_alman> which is different that what you have
[07:28:11] <mipo> but I want to controll sub menus
[07:28:13] <mipo> how?
[07:28:17] <Rost> Oke I made this http://jsfiddle.net/89qrm/ but it doesnt do exacly what I was thinking it should do. I was expecting that it would make every vertical line a different color but the colors are all the same. Did i do something wrong?
[07:28:19] <Michael> Ah okay
[07:28:23] <Michael> interesting
[07:28:30] <amitev> yui has a functionality for class extensions YAHOO.extend(MyNewClass, My.BaseClass, { other properties } )
[07:28:38] <amitev> i'm looking for a similar thing with jquery
[07:28:42] <ben_alman> Rost, i have a guess before even looking: either you need a closure or didn't declare a var
[07:28:43] <ben_alman> looking
[07:29:19] <amirite> can i please get an answer, is there a kosher way to queue animations across different elements/selectors
[07:29:35] <amirite> or do i have to use nested callbacks
[07:29:47] <ben_alman> amirite, check this out
[07:30:01] <ben_alman> https://gist.github.com/850322
[07:30:23] <ben_alman> see the usage example
[07:31:06] <ben_alman> Rost, just in general don't declare vars inside of blocks, just functions
[07:31:21] <amirite> don't understand the code ben
[07:32:02] <Rost> ben_alman, you mean the vars in the for block?
[07:32:06] * amirite sighs
[07:32:53] <ben_alman> amirite, http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/vC8cH/
[07:32:57] <ben_alman> Rost, yes
[07:33:02] <ben_alman> javascript doesn't have block scope
[07:34:59] <Rost> ben_alman, a thats why the colors arent changing?
[07:35:25] <ben_alman> no
[07:35:33] <ben_alman> i think the colors aren't changing because of some canvas stuff
[07:35:37] <ben_alman> but i'm not a canvas master
[07:35:51] <ben_alman> i see you setting the strokeStyle
[07:36:15] <Rost> yes
[07:36:40] <ben_alman> and doing console.log(rgba) i can see it changing it each time
[07:37:06] <ben_alman> but i dunno
[07:37:12] <ben_alman> this is more of a canva question
[07:39:01] <beidas> g
[07:39:06] <beidas> welcome
[07:39:13] <Rost> ok ill try some more :P am not a canvas master either :P
[07:45:33] <JKarsrud> How can I define what keys ui autocomplete searches on?
[07:46:06] <JKarsrud> I have an array of object where the object key I want to search in is named "city"
[07:46:22] <JKarsrud> but all items show up, because it tries to search all items
[07:46:25] <JKarsrud> uhm
[07:46:27] <JKarsrud> search on label
[07:46:43] <JKarsrud> I can't transform the object data either :/
[07:48:55] <JKarsrud> is it impossible to change the keys it looks up?
[07:50:00] <Bjornet> hi I use .wrapAll on a set of <a> and I end up with a mulitiple sets of <div><a></a></div>, instead of just one of those.. anyone that can address what might be wrong?
[07:50:31] <Bjornet> It muliplies as many times as there are <a> in the set,
[07:52:09] <xec> Bjornet: are all the a elements siblings?
[07:52:22] <Bjornet> ah
[07:52:25] <Bjornet> I see it now!
[07:52:30] <Bjornet> they are not
[07:52:34] <Bjornet> thats why
[07:52:52] <Bjornet> So what is the best way to distinguise them
[07:52:54] <innociv> how can I make it so someone can select all text from a div?
[07:53:04] <innociv> copy to clipboard..
[07:53:15] <amitev> yui has a functionality for class extensions YAHOO.extend(MyNewClass, My.BaseClass, { other properties } ), i'm looking for a similar thing with jquery
[07:53:22] <djQuery> there has to be a better way to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/FN7KU/1/     Want to add an icon to a ui dialog button
[07:53:22] <ben_alman> Bjornet, you want to wrap each A individually?
[07:53:28] <Bjornet> jes
[07:53:30] <Bjornet> ye
[07:53:32] <Bjornet> s
[07:53:34] <ben_alman> use .wrap
[07:53:41] <Bjornet> ah well no
[07:53:48] <innociv> oh god.. i have to use flash?
[07:53:54] <Bjornet> no like that. What I have is a blogflow of posts
[07:54:16] <ben_alman> Bjornet, use jsfiddle.net to create an example with a simplified version of your markup please
[07:54:23] <Bjornet> I want to wrap a set of links/anchors in every post..
[07:54:24] <Bjornet> ok
[07:54:26] <Bjornet> a sce
[07:56:16] <djQuery> no one? http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/FN7KU/1/
[07:57:25] <James-> hello
[07:57:51] <xec> Bjornet: maybe, you could first select all your groups of elements, then do .each() and inside do something like $(this).find('a).wrapAll(...)
[07:58:23] <James-> how can i create a div clickable in background in js ?
[07:58:24] <xec> some typos, but you get the point? :)
[07:58:40] <James-> i create with event, but when i click on my site is already the link
[07:58:54] <xec> James-: do you have an url to a live example?
[07:59:02] <James-> yes
[07:59:29] <Bjornet> http://jsfiddle.net/Dgyhv/
[08:00:02] <Bjornet> @xec: yes I thought of something like that.. and you layed it out nice.. Ill try that road. Tnx
[08:00:10] <ben_alman> Bjornet, is there any way you can simplify the html, like manually create a good example that's easy to visually parse?
[08:00:15] <ben_alman> because that's not really helping
[08:00:37] <ben_alman> but yes, each is the way to go in general
[08:00:39] <James-> xec look http://www.olweb.fr/
[08:00:45] <James-> player is clickable
[08:00:46] <ngharo> ?extend @ amitev
[08:00:46] <bot-t> amitev, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[08:00:51] <James-> but not the site
[08:00:58] <josefrichter_> guys, I need to "store" an element initial position in some variable within my plugin. so far I store it as a data attribute of an element but hope there's better way. see http://pastie.org/2003782 line 14 please.
[08:01:01] <James-> i create a div background with jquery event
[08:01:12] <James-> but me all is clickable not just left and right
[08:01:24] <ben_alman> josefrichter_, why is using .data bad?
[08:01:34] <tman> does anyone have exp with using jquery to set the opacity of an img element and noticing that ie ignores it, although it does get the filter applied to it?
[08:02:27] <josefrichter_> ben_alman: not bad, just doesnt seem nice. I would like to read the element's initial css top value and store it, without need to have the data attribute at all.
[08:03:42] <James-> so xec ?
[08:04:04] <ben_alman> josefrichter_, you can use a variable...
[08:05:26] <xec> James-: yes?
[08:05:36] <James-> xec look http://www.olweb.fr/
[08:05:39] <James-> i want same
[08:05:44] <josefrichter_> ben_alman but I need to set the variable once and dont rewrite it every time
[08:05:47] <James-> i have create the div with background
[08:05:50] <djQuery> is there a better way to add an icon to a dialog button? http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/FN7KU/1/
[08:06:01] <James-> but how create click left and right
[08:06:03] <ben_alman> josefrichter_, set it in the each?
[08:07:21] <xec> James-: they just have an a element put behind the rest of the content. this is not jquery related
[08:07:27] <djQuery> James-:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1206203/how-to-distinguish-between-left-and-right-mouse-click-with-jquery
[08:08:08] <James-> xec it s a clickable element in jquery
[08:08:20] <xec> James-: nope, its an a element
[08:08:27] <James-> ?
[08:08:51] <xec> i assume youre talking about the ability to click on the background on left and right sides of the page, right?
[08:08:56] <themadprofessor1> evening
[08:09:00] <James-> yes xec
[08:09:03] <James-> i create same
[08:09:09] <James-> but all is clickable
[08:09:14] <James-> not just left and right
[08:09:19] <SoulRaven> hi
[08:09:25] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to put tabs in dialog?
[08:09:25] <themadprofessor1> err - i should be able to use $.ajax to make a jsonp request to a different domain shouldn't i? (providing i supply a callback?)
[08:09:40] <James-> $('#test').click(function() {
[08:09:41] <James-> 		  alert('Handler for .click() called.');
[08:09:41] <James-> 		});
[08:09:43] <ch3mical> SoulRaven: I don't see why not.
[08:09:55] <ch3mical> ?tias @ SoulRaven
[08:09:56] <bot-t> SoulRaven, Try It And See
[08:09:58] <James-> xec, this alert all page not just left and right
[08:10:04] <SoulRaven> i have try, and is not working:(
[08:10:06] <xec> James-: they have an a element at the top of their html code. in css specified display: block; position: absolute; etc
[08:10:18] <djQuery> James-: then you would have to evaluate the mouse position and the width of the item and see if the mouse position <50% or >50% of the width
[08:10:22] <xec> James-: when the rest of their content follows, it will flow on top, and not be clickable
[08:10:28] <ravenzz> themadprofessor1 yes you can
[08:10:31] <xec> James-: this is not jquery or javascript
[08:10:49] <SoulRaven> bot-t: i have try to put tabs in dialog, and is not working, any ideea way?
[08:10:49] <bot-t> SoulRaven, You may rely on it.
[08:11:22] <djQuery> @doesntwork@soulraven
[08:11:28] <themadprofessor1> thanks ravenzz - wierdly though i'm receiving no response when i do it from within jquery but its working when i drop the url into my browser...
[08:11:39] <ravenzz> uhm
[08:11:48] <ravenzz> i would see some code
[08:11:52] <xec> ?bot @ SoulRaven

[08:11:59] <ch3mical> ?sop @ themadprofessor1
[08:12:00] <bot-t> themadprofessor1, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[08:12:11] <ch3mical> Of course it works when you put the URL in a browser
[08:12:26] <ravenzz> ch3mical he is talking about jsonp
[08:12:28] <djQuery> xec: its fun to see how long they will try to talk to him
[08:12:37] <ch3mical> ravenzz: still follows SOP
[08:12:42] <xec> djQuery: true :)
[08:12:54] <ch3mical> ravenzz: I had that exact problem with an API a couple months back
[08:12:57] <SoulRaven> djQuery: any ideea how to makeit work, and put tabs in dialog?
[08:13:11] <themadprofessor1> err i thought because it was a jsonp request it wouldn't follow SOP
[08:13:31] <ch3mical> ravenzz: themadprofessor1: they weren't returning as type application/json in the HTTP header, even though it was a valid JSONP response
[08:13:38] <Blargh> Helloh, looking at the docs for the MouseUp event it says that one of the parameters is "eventData", how do i know what things are available in this object?
[08:13:57] <ch3mical> themadprofessor1: only if they set it up right, lol
[08:14:03] <khurram> hi all
[08:14:29] <ch3mical> themadprofessor1: what is the MIME-type from the HTTP header?
[08:14:34] <djQuery> SoulRaven: I know I have done it before http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/QwvJ9/
[08:14:55] <djQuery> SoulRaven: but when u just tell us it doesnt work it dont give us much to go one
[08:15:09] <themadprofessor1> application/javascript; charset=utf-8
[08:15:35] <themadprofessor1> is that what you mean?
[08:15:36] <khurram> i am appending divs to one of my div then i have a print html button on pressing that it prints the innerhtml of the parent div into which i was appending divs the problem is  i want to have a line break when i get the html() of parent please can one tell how can i do this ?

[08:15:52] <hariom> I have a legacy javascript code that has dtmlmodal window. I want to add a functionality that it this window closes after few seconds or on upon clicking a close button. How to do that?
[08:15:53] <themadprofessor1> in firebug its called content-type
[08:15:55] <Linkadmin> I'm trying to make a table row click trigger an event *unless* that click is on an actual link on that table. Here's what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/HePm2/
[08:15:56] <ben_alman> yo dawg i herd u liked divs
[08:16:08] <ch3mical> themadprofessor1: application/javascript is not the correct mime-type for jsonp
[08:16:10] <ravenzz> oh ch3mical that's another Issue
[08:16:21] <mikeyutley> divs are the shiz
[08:16:24] <ravenzz> (i mean .. what the are returning)
[08:16:33] <hariom> I have a legacy javascript code that has dtmlmodal window. I want to add a functionality that will closes this window after few seconds or on upon clicking a close button. How to do that?
[08:17:34] <khurram> i get back the html  i.e.  <div ...></div><div .....></div><div....></div>  i want to have line break in between the divs so that when i get the code i can print them correctly but right now it is becomming a very long line of div sss
[08:17:39] <themadprofessor1> what should the mimetype be?
[08:17:40] <ch3mical> themadprofessor1: I don't think you use jsonp with Google APIs, I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be straight JSON.. I think you should consult the documentation
[08:17:45] <progrock> If I have a few elements selected, is there a way to pritn the html (the element and its contents)... I know .html() only prints the contents and if I do .parent().html() its gonna haev mroe than just the element I want
[08:17:58] <themadprofessor1> err its not google
[08:18:00] <ravenzz> ?p @ themadprofessor1

[08:19:17] <khurram> thanks
[08:19:59] <themadprofessor1> this is the service http://sawebservice.red-gate.com/counter/report-count.ashx?callback=test and this is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/SQePK/1/
[08:20:08] <orolo> hariom: ('button').click(fuction() {  $("#modal").hide() });
[08:20:34] <themadprofessor1> page is on a local staging server
[08:20:42] <khurram> i get back the html  i.e.  <div ...></div><div .....></div><div....></div>  i want to have line break in between the divs so that when i get the code i can print them correctly but right now it is becomming a very long line of div sssplease does any one no how to fix it?
[08:20:47] <hariom> orolo: ok, let me try that.
[08:22:12] <ravenzz> themadprofessor1 you are doing something stupid i suppose
[08:22:24] <ravenzz> type: "GET", data: "callback=test",
[08:22:25] <Bjornet> @ben_alman http://jsfiddle.net/Dgyhv/1/
[08:22:26] <ravenzz> data??
[08:22:34] <ch3mical> themadprofessor1: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://sawebservice.red-gate.com/counter/report-count.ashx. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[08:23:05] <ch3mical> themadprofessor1: they don't have their API set up properly, you're going to have to proxy it through php or something
[08:23:17] <themadprofessor1> ah i've already set up a proxy and that was working
[08:23:25] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/SQePK/2/
[08:23:27] <themadprofessor1> so should i tell them that they need to set the mimetype properly?
[08:23:33] <ravenzz> this works
[08:23:46] <khurram> helloOO
[08:23:46] <ravenzz> you miss dataType: "jsonp",
[08:24:01] <Altreus> Can anyone help me with changing the order in which my event listeners are fired?
[08:24:12] <ch3mical> Oh, there's the problem :)
[08:24:19] <ch3mical> Good catch, ravenzz
[08:24:30] <themadprofessor1> aaah im an idiot :) thanks ravenzzz
[08:25:00] <themadprofessor1> should i not have 'date' when its a get? surely thats still fine for the callback
[08:25:04] <b1lly> does this look wrong
[08:25:16] <b1lly> $('ul.truck1 li').each()
[08:25:18] <khurram> i get back the html  i.e.  <div ...></div><div .....></div><div....></div>  i want to have line break in between the divs so that when i get the code i can print them correctly but right now it is becomming a very long line of div sssplease does any one no how to fix it?

[08:28:40] <dayveh> im trying to find out why pretty photo doesnt work on the gallery section of http://hawkinscreative.co.uk/Seven/SevenBar/
[08:29:03] <dayveh> it seems to open up below the rest of the content
[08:29:08] <dayveh> rather than as a lightbox
[08:29:24] <phrearch> hm, if i have a class containing some string, how would i select that class based on a substring?

[08:31:27] <hariom> orolo: I am not every familiar with jsfiddle.net. But I have something like this: <input type="button" value="Close this window" onClick="closeThisWindow()"/>  and the javascript is function closeThisWindow() {

[08:31:27] <hariom> 	$("#modal").hide();
[08:31:27] <hariom> }   Here I can see the console.log message but it doesn't close the window.
[08:32:01] <ngharo> is it a jquery ui dialog?
[08:32:08] <orolo> hariom: what is the div id of your modal window? (<div id="myModal">)?
[08:32:47] <Bjornet> @ben_alman @xec usage of .each did the trick! Tnx
[08:32:55] <dayveh> anytone got any idea on how I can fix my problem?
[08:33:35] <hariom> This modal windows is created in the parent window by clicking on the button:   <button class="wizard_modal_button" onclick='table_wizard_modal=dhtmlmodal.open("wizard_1_window", "iframe", "code/my_wizard?wizard_start=1", "Create My Wizard", "width=500px,height=500px,resize=1,scrolling=1,center=1"); return false'>Create My Wizard</button>

[08:34:46] <hariom> orolo: ok
[08:35:04] <hariom> ngharo: I have this legacy code on which I am trying out.
[08:35:27] <ngharo> dayveh: yep, first thing you should be doing is watching the console while you load your page to debug problems
[08:35:36] <ngharo> dayveh: 404 shows up there
[08:36:13] <ngharo> hariom: in that case, i think you have to call dhtmlmodal.close()
[08:36:16] <dayveh> ngharo thanks for the tip! i just re uploaded prettyPhoto and im still getting the same error though
[08:36:29] <ngharo> dayveh: still 404
[08:38:03] <phrearch> hm, something like http://www.jqueryin.com/2010/04/19/jquery-getmatchingclass-plugin/
[08:38:07] <ngharo> yay you did it dayveh :)
[08:38:22] <orolo> :)
[08:38:25] <dayveh> ngharo, does it work for you?
[08:38:30] <dayveh> im still getting the error
[08:38:42] <ngharo> phrearch: there is a "starts with" selector built into jquery.  I'm not sure it'll work with classes but you can try
[08:39:03] <dayveh> ngharo correction, yay it works!
[08:39:07] <dayveh> thank you
[08:39:24] <ngharo> phrearch: $('div[class^=foo]') for matching <div class="foobar"  />
[08:39:26] <hariom> hgharo: I get this error- t is undefined
[08:39:26] <hariom> close(t=undefined, forceclose=undefined)modal.js (line 55)
[08:39:26] <hariom> closeThisWindow()
[08:39:50] <phrearch> ngharo: thanks, ill give that a try
[08:40:03] <Bjornet> ?paste
[08:40:04] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[08:40:07] <ngharo> hariom: idk man
[08:40:15] <ngharo> yeah paste dat shiet
[08:40:48] <hariom> orolo: I have created an id "modal" in the button element in the parent window but that doesn't help
[08:40:49] <Bjornet> @ben_alman did u write that to me or some else?
[08:41:11] <ben_alman> to whoever pasted a ton of code in here
[08:41:16] <ben_alman> i don't remember
[08:41:23] <phrearch> hm no match with console.log($('button[class^=rte-selection]'));
[08:41:24] <Bjornet> ah, not me ^^
[08:42:58] <ngharo> phrearch: seems to work for me: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/rZWeW/
[08:43:26] <ngharo> maybe you have to quote the substring like in my example
[08:43:39] <phrearch> ngharo: indeed, must be some problem in my code
[08:43:40] <josefrichter_> how do I make mousemove event ignore entering overlapping divs, please?
[08:43:45] <phrearch> ah yea
[08:44:20] <jeffsmykil> wtf  userDate.getDay(); thinks its the 3rd and my system clock is correct
[08:44:26] <ngharo> josefrichter_: ignore event on parent divs?
[08:45:47] <josefrichter_> ngharo: actually on child divs
[08:46:04] <mrHat> ok im using jquery to send an request and append the data to a div which needs to change it's height and width depending on the content returned. So far I have: http://pastebin.com/BDww1JpX however this doesn't return the new width and height it just returns the previously set css values. Does anyone know how to acheive this? Thanks for any help
[08:46:12] <ngharo> josefrichter_: well events bubble up the dom tree
[08:46:50] <ngharo> you can stop that from happening, see ?stopPropagation
[08:46:50] <bot-t> event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[08:47:19] <josefrichter_> ngharo have mousemove bound on some #wrapper but have some divs within the #wrapper and when I enter them, my offsetX / offsetY value jumps.
[08:47:39] <phrearch> ngharo: http://jsfiddle.net/rZWeW/1/
[08:48:09] <phrearch> it seems not to work when having multiple classes?
[08:48:42] <ngharo> phrearch: i think because it's not really aware of classes.  it's just treating it like any other attribute as a string
[08:48:50] <jeffsmykil> anyone have any insight into my date object problem?
[08:49:14] <phrearch> ngharo: aha, then i should put the class involved at the front
[08:49:42] <ngharo> phrearch: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/rZWeW/2/
[08:49:48] <phrearch> ok, now it works :)
[08:50:04] <ben_alman> phrearch, why not do $('button.rte-selection')
[08:50:10] <ben_alman> to find all buttons that have that class
[08:50:25] <ngharo> josefrichter_: console log event.target in your mousemove handler
[08:50:35] <ngharo> you should be able to filter from there
[08:50:44] <phrearch> ben_alman: there are other buttons that have other named classes starting with rte-selection
[08:50:50] <phrearch> ngharo: thanks!
[08:51:10] <ben_alman> phrearch, then use 2 classes, rte-selection and rte-selection-whatever
[08:51:14] <ben_alman> and select on ret-selection
[08:51:19] <ben_alman> that would be WAY more performant
[08:51:41] <phrearch> ben_alman: probably better yes. but now i know how to do it with * as well :)
[08:51:58] <ben_alman> yeah but that way is significantly slower, so avoid it
[08:51:59] <mrHat> anyone please ?
[08:52:14] <josefrichter_> ngharo: as expected, the target changes to the overlapping div I enter. any way to ignore it?
[08:52:43] <mrHat> ok im using jquery to send an request and append the data to a div which needs to change it's height and width depending on the content returned. So far I have: http://pastebin.com/BDww1JpX however this doesn't return the new width and height it just returns the previously set css values. Does anyone know how to acheive this? Thanks for any help
[08:53:13] <ngharo> josefrichter_: yeah just catch it and return false
[08:54:49] <josefrichter_> ngharo: something like $("#wrapper").children().mousemove(.... rerturn false ) ?
[08:55:57] <ngharo> ?p @ josefrichter_
[08:55:57] <bot-t> josefrichter_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[08:56:07] <ngharo> lemme see what youre doing
[08:56:26] <mrHat> why am i beeing ignored
[08:56:52] <ngharo> mrHat: take out the explicit height/width in css
[08:56:59] <ngharo> and try again
[08:58:02] <mrHat> ngharo who said i have any height/width set
[08:58:15] <josefrichter_> ngharo http://jsfiddle.net/josefrichter/Qej69/
[08:58:22] <mrHat> the container (where the ajax response it's injected) have no css applied
[08:58:29] <josefrichter_> ngharo everything fine unless you enter the green or red div
[08:59:46] <ngharo> mrHat: you said "previous set css values"
[09:01:31] <markj> mrHat try setting target again before attempting to read it's height and width
[09:01:37] <ngharo> josefrichter_: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/Qej69/1/
[09:02:05] <mrHat> markj what do you mean
[09:02:40] <markj> inject the html, then redeclare the target variable before calling width and height on it
[09:03:04] <NackNick> can someone take a quick look at my code somewhere my math is a bit off, im trying to have month rate divide loan rate which is 30000 by 12 and for some reason my answer keeps coming out 750000000
[09:03:06] <josefrichter_> ngharo: the problem is the animation actually stops when I enter the child element, which I dont want
[09:03:08] <NackNick> http://jsfiddle.net/m4GtX/
[09:04:28] <ngharo> josefrichter_: oh.  hmm
[09:05:28] <mrHat> markj it still returns 0
[09:07:53] <markj> mrHat do you have an example online?
[09:09:32] <mrHat> no , but i'm pasting now the exact code (relevant part)
[09:10:39] <markj> yes but we cant see what is actually happening without an example :) for all I know data is empty
[09:10:54] <markj> it no doubt isnt, but you see my point
[09:11:06] <alexiswilliams> i don't know if this is the right forum. i am n00b on jquery... just immigrated from dojo... sortable with multiple draggable, does not look natively supported. is there a solution that someone can cite?
[09:11:18] <mrHat> mark
[09:11:19] <mrHat> http://pastebin.com/DzcePzmB
[09:11:54] <mrHat> pp_dimensions = _fitToViewport(movie_width,movie_height); right now the sizes are retreived from params and are fixed
[09:12:19] <mrHat> but i would like to get the dimensions of "toInject" response
[09:13:24] <koesbong> alexiswilliams: have you checked out jquery ui?
[09:14:10] <alexiswilliams> @koesbong yes, checked jquery ui documentation
[09:15:24] <alexiswilliams> you have http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ that shows helpful stuff like of course the items u want draggable, but not a hook up to make them where they are groupable dynamically like u can do in something like dojo
[09:16:13] <ajpiano> alexiswilliams, you'd probably have to get clever and use a droppable that was itself draggable
[09:18:13] <alexiswilliams> might have to do that. i have seen that sighted as a work around on stackoverflow.com

[09:35:56] <authy> is there any way to combine .delay() with .ajax()? I would really like to postpone an ajax call, but its moderately prohibitive to pass it off in a setTimeout
[09:36:20] <ben_alman> prohibitive?
[09:36:38] <authy> To be more clear, I am using .post(), not .ajax().
[09:36:50] <gnarf> authy: .delay() wont affect ajax
[09:36:54] <erichynds> if by prohibitive you mean using the right tool for the right job
[09:37:00] <ccmonster> for the life of me, I cannot get the jquery ui menu, or menubar pieces to work
[09:37:01] <gnarf> authy: use a setTimeout
[09:37:44] <gnarf> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/ -- Needs some use testing... Take a look!
[09:38:09] <authy> erichynds: That seems like a knee-jerk response with a lot of assumptions about knowing my code.
[09:38:25] <authy> .delay() seems like a perfect fit with .post()... any intuition about why that isn't supported?
[09:38:43] <gnarf> authy: .delay() is just a fancy wrapper for setTimeout that works with .queue() functions
[09:38:49] <gnarf> ajax isn't queued using .queue()
[09:39:11] <ben_alman> authy, .delay is a per-element effects queue method, and $.post is a non-element-specific ajax method
[09:39:16] <erichynds> i disagree
[09:39:16] <authy> can I put the ajax call inside of a queue() object to get around this?
[09:39:33] <ben_alman> even though it's called .delay it's more specific than setTimeout, which is what you want to use here
[09:39:36] <ben_alman> ?mdc setTimeout
[09:39:38] <bot-t> ben_alman, window.setTimeout - MDC Docs - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Window.setTimeout
[09:39:45] <gnarf> .delay( ms ).queue(function( next ) { $.post(); next(); }) would work... but seriously thats like 5 extra function calls compared to setTimeout(function() { $.post(); }, ms );
[09:39:49] <ajpiano> yeah, setTimeout clearly is the operative choice, imo.
[09:40:04] <gnarf> ben_alman: see ?setTimeout :)
[09:40:05] <bot-t> ben_alman, var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[09:40:18] <ben_alman> authy, if you want to use a jQuery method however, you can look at my doTimeout plugin
[09:40:21] <authy> gnarf: I was under the impression that setTimeout still expected me to pass it a string of the function, which is why i avoid it like the plague
[09:40:23] <ben_alman> ?g jquery dotimeout
[09:40:24] <bot-t> ben_alman, Ben Alman » jQuery doTimeout: Like setTimeout, but better - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[09:40:34] <gnarf> authy: NEVER pass strings to setTimeout
[09:40:38] <ben_alman> authy, no, pass it a function reference
[09:40:41] <ben_alman> not a string
[09:40:44] <ben_alman> see the mozilla docs
[09:40:48] <ben_alman> that the bot linked
[09:40:57] <beakybal4> can anyone here help me with uploadify?
[09:41:15] <authy> gnarf: Full disclosure: haven't used setTimeout in years... but ill do the function reference then. That is perfectly satisfactory to me
[09:41:39] <gnarf> authy: full disclosure: you could of used functions years ago ;)
[09:44:24] <authy> Anyways, thanks all. I really just wanted a better understanding of why .delay() didn't work, and now I understand the queue system better.
[09:48:16] <aoeuhtsn> Can I bind an event handler to a keypress, like if the user presses shift-Â§?
[09:48:56] <Jon47> aoeuhtsn - you can sure try.. I don't know what kind of keyboard has a Â§ key
[09:49:33] <aoeuhtsn> Jon47: A lot of European keyboards. Do you know how?
[09:49:46] <beakybal4> anyone here use uploadify?
[09:50:43] <Jon47> aoeuhtsn - just bind a handler to the keypress event, then check to see if the event.keyCode or event.which exists, and compare it to the code of the key you're looking for
[09:51:09] <Jon47> http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
[09:51:39] <innociv> How can I have one browser window communicate with another on the same domain?   I noticed that localStorage can do this, which is amazing, but there are issues with that (what if it's full?  What if it's not supported?).  Is there anything else that can?
[09:51:43] <themad_afk> hullo me again :)
[09:52:04] <SoulRaven> djQuery: this is the js of the dialog
[09:52:05] <SoulRaven> http://pastebin.com/QznQCLy8
[09:52:34] <jcapelo> hello I am looking for some help on calling a json from an url, ive followed the examples in http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ and got the flickr one to work (dough) hehe but I am trying with a personal json in a remote server and nothing is showing up I need some guidance please
[09:52:53] <SoulRaven> and i get this error: Unexpected token {
[09:52:55] <aoeuhtsn> Jon47: The keypress event of the jQuery object is what I should use? $.keypress(); ?
[09:53:11] <SoulRaven> i still get to work tabs on dialog
[09:53:27] <themadprofessor> i'm now using http://pastebin.com/1GGLgAFH to read the json data
[09:53:33] <themadprofessor> but i receive an error in the jquery console
[09:54:10] <ngharo> themadprofessor: try appending ?callback=? to your url
[09:54:22] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: that's a simple syntax error, just run your code through jshint.com
[09:55:02] <Jon47> aoeuhtsn you want to bind an event handler for a keypress event, .bind('keypress') or .keypress() would be pretty much the same, I assume
[09:55:42] <ngharo> themadprofessor: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/fubYT/
[09:57:19] <aoeuhtsn> Jon47: And if I want the event to be triggered no matter what area of the document the key is pressed, what jQuery object do I use?
[09:57:37] <ngharo> ?mdc same origin policy @ jcapelo
[09:57:38] <bot-t> jcapelo, Same origin policy for JavaScript - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[09:58:24] <ngharo> innociv: as in window.open?
[09:59:01] <Jon47> aoeuhtsn same thing ... bind the handler to the document or body or something
[09:59:22] <aoeuhtsn> Jon47: Thank you for answering my stupid question :P
[09:59:23] <Jon47> the matched elements you bind to will be the elements that the event gets observed on..
[09:59:34] <innociv> ngharo, no
[10:00:18] <koesbong> gotta say - my favorite irc channel is this jquery channel.  went to #codeigniter and #twitterapi with questions and all i got was silent treatment
[10:00:55] <d4rklit3> heyo
[10:01:16] <ngharo> innociv: dunno then.  like you said local storage would be cool, else i suppose you could talk through a server via ajax
[10:01:27] <d4rklit3> does an iframe inherit the parents stylesheet?
[10:01:51] <ngharo> no
[10:02:28] <innociv> the ajax uses a lot of bandwidth.  Can do that now, but use too much bandwidth.
[10:02:43] <innociv> Looks like localstorage and hooking the onstorage event is the only way
[10:02:58] <jcapelo> ngharo so that means this kind of url wont work for json request? not even with jsonp? http://blahblah.com:9292/tae/operations/balance?idclient=68003
[10:03:04] <SoulRaven> ajpiano: ok, but where is the mystake, i see that is in line 36, but the sintax is corect, http://pastebin.com/QznQCLy8
[10:03:12] <d4rklit3> ngharo: was that no direct @ me?
[10:03:31] <ngharo> jcapelo: only if the page requesting it is on the same domain, port, protocol
[10:03:44] <SoulRaven> i have try with http://jshint.com/, and i get an error on line 36, but i don't know way, because the bind sintax is corect
[10:04:15] <jcapelo> poopie, hehe
[10:04:34] <jcapelo> but then jsonp would come in no?
[10:04:40] <ngharo> jcapelo: google Access-Control-Allow-Origin and jsonp
[10:05:47] <ngharo> d4rklit3: yes it was.  iframe does not inherit its parents stylesheet
[10:06:01] <d4rklit3> ok thanks
[10:06:07] <ngharo> d4rklit3: an iframe is it's own document itself
[10:06:38] <themadprofessor> @ngharo - thank you sir, worked perfectly
[10:07:06] <d4rklit3> so our client is stupid
[10:07:10] <d4rklit3> for sending us a link to the .css
[10:07:28] <d4rklit3> the .css reference needs to be in the the content they sent us not seperate
[10:07:31] <ngharo> SoulRaven: look closer
[10:07:33] <ngharo> you have a typo
[10:07:50] <d4rklit3> unless there is an other way to embed it. php is out because they don't allow cross-domain includes
[10:08:02] <ngharo> d4rklit3: you can write to an iframe i think
[10:08:23] <d4rklit3> ngharo: can i write a stylesheet to it?
[10:08:34] <ngharo> $('iframe#foo head').append('<style ... />')
[10:08:35] <ngharo> maybe
[10:08:36] <themadprofessor> @ngharo - actually, strangely, it worked fine wihtout the callback... it's the json2.js which is having trouble parsing it i think
[10:08:46] <d4rklit3> hmm
[10:09:41] <themadprofessor> i'm using https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js, maybe it only works on json not jsonp
[10:11:10] <ngharo> no idea, i'm not familiar with it
[10:13:54] <themadprofessor> actully
[10:14:13] <themadprofessor> does $.ajax automatically parse the jsonp into objects that i can access? maybe the parser isn't necessary
[10:14:22] <b1lly> if you using a .each(), is there a way to tell if your on the "last" item?
[10:14:26] <b1lly> to trigger an event
[10:14:51] <themadprofessor> YES it does
[10:14:52] <themadprofessor> ideal :)
[10:14:55] <jcapelo> ngharo: but then how does a call to lets say to Flickr work if its not same domain, port
[10:16:04] <draginx> How can I make it so the scrollbar is at the very top? $('html').scrollTop(0); is said to not work in IE 8 =/
[10:16:05] <cviebrock> if I have foo = $(this);  how can I get reference "this" using foo?  (i.e. the inverse)
[10:16:18] <ngharo> jcapelo: jsonp
[10:17:01] <jcapelo> and does the jsonp part come only from the code I write, or does it have to be change in the service im requesting?
[10:17:32] <amid_hasan> jcapelo, I am dealing with similar scenario
[10:17:33] <phlp> cviebrock: foo.get()
[10:17:39] <ngharo> jcapelo: both
[10:17:51] <cviebrock> phlp: that returns the HTML element?
[10:17:55] <jcapelo> ok,
[10:18:07] <ngharo> http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?jsoncallback=foobar&format=json
[10:18:21] <phlp> cviebrock: yes dom element
[10:18:29] <b1lly> how do you know when the last iteration of a .each() is triggered?
[10:18:35] <ngharo> notice how the json data is wrapped in the jsoncallback argument (foobar)
[10:18:42] <cviebrock> phlp: great, thx!
[10:19:04] <ngharo> b1lly: it exits the loop and continues with the next line of code ??
[10:19:18] <amid_hasan> do you all know a good tutorial on json/jquery use with php server side?

[10:20:08] <systemfault> Super jQueryUI question of death: Why are the scrollbars somehow disabled on chrome only when a modal dialog is open?
[10:21:34] <necromancer> am i the only person in the world who thinks jquery ui is ugly?
[10:21:44] <cviebrock> hehe ...
[10:21:51] <cviebrock> sometimes
[10:22:02] <necromancer> the preview of the new version looks really cool though
[10:22:11] <cviebrock> url?
[10:22:35] <DEac-> necromancer: why you should think it's ugly?
[10:23:28] <muley> where's the preview of the new version?
[10:24:28] <muley> i really hope it's backward compatible... seems like every few versions, everything in the UI breaks when i try to upgrade
[10:25:06] <systemfault> necromancer: As long as it can be customized..
[10:25:19] <muley> i keep hoping they'll solidify the classes and etc as it matures =S
[10:25:37] <systemfault> The shitty startup for which I work have weird requirements..
[10:26:04] <necromancer> DEac-: everything's big and clunky, color choices are strange, and they simply don't fit into most of the designs i'm tasked to work on
[10:26:33] <systemfault> necromancer: CSS exists :P
[10:26:37] <muley> the themeroller let's you pick your own colors
[10:26:47] <necromancer> i guess it's more about the patterns and stuff
[10:27:09] <muley> do you have a link to a preview of the new version? i'm quite curious...
[10:27:11] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: you're not forced to use their CSS, that's the cool part
[10:27:30] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: you just need to follow some of their markup suggestions, which are good anyway
[10:27:35] <necromancer> yeah
[10:27:36] <amid_hasan> necromancer: jquery ui is really ugly agreed
[10:27:53] <necromancer> ryanneufeld: by the time i've restyled all of the widgets, i could have just made my own :)
[10:28:11] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: And written all the JS for them?
[10:28:13] <necromancer> muley: they post pics on http://blog.jqueryui.com sometimes
[10:28:31] <muley> yeah i've been digging around through here...
[10:29:06] <necromancer> ryanneufeld: yeah, i mean creating a modal dialog for example isn't that hard in JS, but the jQuery UI one is a little different because it has to be configured properly. but if i'm just writing a plugin for one site, i don't need all that extra shit so i don't write it in
[10:29:20] <necromancer> we do use datepicker around here though
[10:29:25] <necromancer> which is pretty sweet honestly
[10:29:41] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: yeah, we do the same thing here, we use a couple bits and bobs, like the sliders
[10:29:47] <systemfault> The thing is...
[10:29:48] <ryanneufeld> which are pretty cool
[10:29:50] <muley> buttons are nice too
[10:30:02] <systemfault> jQuery UI has been widely-used and beaten to death...
[10:30:03] <cviebrock> don't see any pics on the blog ... hrm?
[10:30:05] <ryanneufeld> I'll be using their menus for a personal project of mine as soon as 1.9 is released
[10:30:17] <necromancer> systemfault: right, so designers aren't making stuff that looks that way anymore
[10:30:27] <necromancer> so you have to do a shit ton of hacking/formatting to get it to look pretty
[10:30:31] <systemfault> necromancer: It can be restyled...
[10:30:33] <muley> yeah i've been using that menu for months... it's pretty nice
[10:30:38] <necromancer> ryanneufeld: i tried to use the progressbar for this audio player i was making, but it didn't work at all =(
[10:30:56] <necromancer> systemfault: restyling is much harder (imo) than writing your own styles
[10:30:58] <muley> progressbar is alllll css
[10:31:29] <muley> cviebrock: yeah, i can't find any pics either
[10:31:34] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: not to insult, but it's probably something you missed. In other words pebkac
[10:31:47] <ryanneufeld> ?pebakc @necromancer
[10:31:48] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Couldn't find "pebakc" in jQuery Docs.
[10:31:59] <ryanneufeld> ?ud:pebakc @necromancer
[10:32:00] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Couldn't find "ud:pebakc" in jQuery Docs.
[10:32:03] <systemfault> necromancer: But I know that jQuery UI works on older browsers, just restyling jQuery UI is less work imho
[10:32:18] <ryanneufeld> ?ud pebakc @necromancer
[10:32:18] <systemfault> All the "quirks".. compatibility trouble..
[10:32:18] <muley> the UI icons really come in handy too
[10:32:22] <bot-t> necromancer, Not found - pebakc isn't defined yet.
[10:32:29] <ryanneufeld> blast
[10:32:33] <muley> :D
[10:32:44] <systemfault> pebkac should be defined :'(

[10:34:14] <muley> much better
[10:34:38] <muley> calendar looks cool
[10:34:42] <amid_hasan> can you guys help me with an example of js calling remote RESTFUL script that fetches results in json and then updates dom with results?
[10:34:46] <jcapelo> ngharo: and for enabling jsonp server-side do you know what would have to be done?
[10:34:48] <ccmonster> ok so..
[10:34:57] <ccmonster> jquery ui menu and menubar, anyone used it?
[10:35:39] <necromancer> ryanneufeld: probably, but it basically came down to which solution would be faster, and i got the progressbar coded in little over a half hour.
[10:35:55] <necromancer> although i should probably translate it to progressbar just to better understand it so i can use it again :)
[10:36:01] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: then you found the right solution for your problem :)
[10:36:18] <necromancer> yeah
[10:36:23] <necromancer> the new jquery ui looks REALLY good
[10:36:27] <necromancer> reminds me of the github ui :)
[10:36:47] <necromancer> that's why i want to learn more about jQUI because in the future it will be very useful, and very pretty
[10:37:11] <blindMoe> there are a lot of things on jqueryui.com that just don't work
[10:37:27] <necromancer> blindMoe: have you tried them in firefox?
[10:37:31] <blindMoe> none of the images in the content of the homepage are coming up for me and a lot of the demos just stopped working.. wonder what happened
[10:37:54] <mipo> How to get a tag value in sortable plugin?
[10:38:41] <d4rklit3> hey how do i write a the contents of a .html file into a body.innerHtml = ?
[10:39:05] <ryanneufeld> ?load @ d4rklit3
[10:39:05] <bot-t> d4rklit3, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[10:39:15] <ryanneufeld> that's not right
[10:39:16] <d4rklit3> is there a pure DOM way to do it?
[10:39:17] <mipo> :(
[10:39:26] <necromancer> ?ajax @ d4rklit3

[10:39:59] <ryanneufeld> That's what I was after
[10:40:49] <necromancer> there ya go
[10:40:51] <ngharo> jcapelo: i believe your server needs to respond with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <domain | *> header
[10:41:01] <DukeDrake> ll
[10:41:19] <d4rklit3> hrmm
[10:41:19] <aleksandrz> wat
[10:41:29] <d4rklit3> i was hoping to actually not use jquery :P
[10:41:50] <necromancer> ryanneufeld: oh so $.load is basically a shorthand for $.get('blah.html', function(data) { $('element').html(data); });?
[10:41:50] <d4rklit3> trying to use php
[10:41:56] <necromancer> d4rklit3: you can use both...
[10:41:57] <necromancer> lol
[10:42:04] <d4rklit3> weird error
[10:42:07] <d4rklit3> missing ; before statement
[10:42:08] <necromancer> d4rklit3: also, if you don't want to use jquery why did you ask here?
[10:42:10] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: yes
[10:42:13] <iAmTheDave> what would be the best way of making results from an ajax query appear to "stream" in to place? (create a series of <li> tags that fade in as they're added)
[10:42:27] <ryanneufeld> d4rklit3 is a help vampire
[10:42:33] <necromancer> d4rklit3: ##javascript is more for general js

[10:43:02] <necromancer> yes.
[10:43:05] <necromancer> YES.
[10:43:06] <blindMoe> iAmTheDave: use a timer with a randomized time to add them?

[10:43:26] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, #5014 (IE8 bug $(element).append() bug with multiple TEXT params ... - Opened 22 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5014
[10:43:39] <necromancer> d4rklit3: you shouldn't use straight JS and jQuery simultaneously, btw, unless you really know what you're doing
[10:44:07] <necromancer> however, if you really know what you're doing, you would have already picked one of those technologies and stuck to it already :)
[10:44:32] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: you're kinda wrong there
[10:44:54] <ryanneufeld> jquery is great, but sometimes you can get a better result by using plain ol'js
[10:45:02] <jcapelo> ngharo: would that be all?
[10:45:08] <ryanneufeld> dealing with arrays and such for example
[10:45:12] <jcapelo> ngharo: you been more than helpful :) thx
[10:46:16] <ryanneufeld> jquery tends to lead one into a very DOM centric approach to solving problems.
[10:46:35] <ryanneufeld> not every problem is best solved, if at all, by using a DOM centric approach
[10:46:52] <ryanneufeld> jQuery is a great intro to JS in general as it teaches some good habbits
[10:47:38] <ngharo> jcapelo: pretty much then just return json wrapped in the callback
[10:51:48] <jcapelo> goodie thx ngharo
[10:54:04] <geekbuntu__> ::does jquery have any out of the box json (specifically "feed") parsers?
[10:54:20] <themadprofessor> does .length not work with integers
[10:54:26] <themadprofessor> <edit> nope it doesn't seem to
[10:54:29] <bakers> Are their native jquery ways to scroll a page to 1234px from the top?
[10:54:39] <themadprofessor> is there an equivilent to know how many numbers an integer consists of?
[10:54:53] <necromancer> ryanneufeld: that is true, jQuery does teach some good habits. and realistically, translating a plugin from jQuery-centric into DOM-centric (as in, pure js) is not hard. but i just think it's better practice to stick to ONE framework unless absolutely necessary. in d4rklit3's case, he was trying to use body.innerHTML, when it would be both easier and better practice to use $('body').html()
[10:55:22] <d4rklit3> necromancer: im trying to inject a stylesheet into an iframe
[10:55:23] <aoeuhtsn> Is it possible to trigger a keypress without being in an editable? As in a key being pressed anywhere on the body. Something like $('body').keypress(); but actually working.
[10:55:58] <necromancer> aoeuhtsn: https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys
[10:56:06] <necromancer> might give you a little inspiration :)
[10:56:22] <smearcampaign> necromancer: javascript is not a framework. It's a language. JQuery is a framework (kinda). Jquery exists to manipulate the dom/normalize ajax/have some other helpers.
[10:56:25] <aoeuhtsn> necromancer: Will take a look
[10:56:39] <necromancer> smearcampaign: no kinda. jquery IS a framework.
[10:56:42] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: I agree with you
[10:57:21] <smallfoot-> i ran getJSON(), got some items and put them TR's in a table, now i try call $('tr') but it finds none
[10:58:05] <smallfoot-> it finds other TR that was there statically before getJSON, but not the new TR that arrive dynamically by JSON
[10:58:07] <bentruyman> necromancer: "A library is something you call/inherit from your code, but framework is something that calls your code or provide services for your code"
[10:58:10] <necromancer> i mean technically, you can't help but use javascript :)
[10:58:50] <smallfoot-> anyone know why?
[10:59:00] <cfurrow> smallfoot-, and you can see the new tr's in the DOM or in your browser?
[10:59:08] <smallfoot-> oh
[10:59:43] <necromancer> bentruyman: you call/inherit things from a framework too
[11:00:02] <themadprofessor> is there an easy way to find out the size of an integer -> so 12345 would be 5
[11:00:23] <necromancer> oh wow the wikipedia page used to list jQuery as a web application framework, now it's just a JavaScript library
[11:00:29] <cfurrow> themadprofessor, you could make it a string, and get its length
[11:00:49] <themadprofessor> yep thats what i did before, just wanted to check if there was a way keeping it as a native number
[11:01:19] <necromancer> bentruyman: if you use that to define framework, then there is no such thing as a javascript framework. except perhaps the DOM.
[11:01:30] <necromancer> although i'd call that an API more than anything else
[11:01:31] <cfurrow> themadprofessor, you can do different modulos on it, but that gets messy and cumbersome. Not worth it.
[11:01:46] <themadprofessor> okay i'll just to a toString() and checklength
[11:01:47] <themadprofessor> ta :)
[11:02:00] <smallfoot-> cfurrow, the DOM looks valid, its table->tbody->tr->td
[11:02:35] <cfurrow> smallfoot-, and you see your previous TRs and the new TRs you added with getJSON()?
[11:02:54] <smallfoot-> yes
[11:03:15] <cfurrow> smallfoot-, can you paste your code into a jsfiddle.net? So we can see it?
[11:03:16] <bentruyman> necromancer: that's not true at all
[11:03:27] <bentruyman> necromancer: have you taken a look at projects like SproutCore?
[11:03:36] <smallfoot-> pj
[11:03:38] <smallfoot-> oh*
[11:06:26] <necromancer> bentruyman: ah yes, i forgot about the v8 sector
[11:06:38] <necromancer> bentruyman: v8 javascript doesn't count! ;)
[11:07:25] <necromancer> but seriously, i was talking more about the browser-based JS that we're all used to. v8/node.js stuff is nice, but unfortunately doesn't solve a lot of the problems that people have with javascript.
[11:07:26] <bentruyman> necromancer: v8? I'm not talking about v8
[11:07:36] <necromancer> sproutcore runs on node, which runs on the v8 engine
[11:07:43] <jeffsmykil> is there something wrong with my syntax?  setInterval(staffTimelineFunction), 10000;
[11:08:05] <necromancer> what i call the "v8 sector" is everything developed for node.js or any other framework that may come out/be around
[11:08:06] <cfurrow> jeffsmykil, yes
[11:08:18] <smearcampaign> closure is a framework
[11:08:18] <jeffsmykil> cfurrow: care to tell me what it is?  :D
[11:08:20] <cfurrow> jeffsmykil, setInterval(staffTimelineFunction, 10000);
[11:08:31] <necromancer> but we're gonna see a split between v8 javascript and DOM javascript, if it hasn't already happened
[11:08:36] <necromancer> in terms of how the language is constructed
[11:08:43] <jeffsmykil> cfurrow: thank you sir
[11:09:25] <smearcampaign> nm, closure is called a library for some reason.
[11:09:41] <smearcampaign> Even though it adds features like type checking
[11:10:10] <bittyx-laptop> hiya! i'm making a sort of an edit-in-place system, and i'm having problems with a textarea object. namely, when i set the contents of a div to the contents of the textarea with .text(), my new lines get lost, and .text() is supposed to preserve such formatting (e.g. turn new lines into <br /> or whatever)... either that, or i'm having a logic problem. i've thought about using a <pre> to store the contents of the textarea, but i'm not sure if t
[11:10:10] <bittyx-laptop> hat's too "hacky"
[11:10:25] <skylamer`> hey
[11:10:31] <bittyx-laptop> anyone have any advice?
[11:11:00] <smearcampaign> bittyx-laptop: can you share some code?
[11:11:01] <skylamer`> http://pastie.org/2004603
[11:11:13] <skylamer`> is this thing makes a input value to iframe src atribut ?
[11:11:33] <bittyx-laptop> smearcampaign: hmm, it's part of an admin panel, so i can't give a live link, but hold on, i'll mangle something together in jsfiddle.
[11:13:04] <bittyx-laptop> smearcampaign: oh, just a sec, thought of something, i'll try using .replace() to mimick php's nl2br function.
[11:16:06] <jeffsmykil> oh man rhapsody finally ditched flash on their website for their music player
[11:16:11] <jeffsmykil> thank goodness
[11:16:26] <smallfoot-> I would like to give a big thank you to cfurrow for looking at my code, and helping me fix it, when it didn't work. Thanks man! :)
[11:16:57] <cfurrow> jeffsmykil, np (sorry for the late reply)
[11:17:05] <jeffsmykil> cfurrow: no worries
[11:19:38] <skylamer`> http://pastie.org/2004603
[11:19:42] <skylamer`> any one ? :)
[11:21:08] <ryanneufeld> skylamer`: I think what you're doing there violates the same origin policy

[11:22:08] <cfurrow> skylamer`, the policy of the internets
[11:22:37] <skylamer`> no i just want to make a input field url to go in to iframe src atrib :)
[11:22:57] <cfurrow> skylamer`, I think you should be able to do that. I don't think I've ever tried, but I think you can do that. Hmm
[11:23:14] <skylamer`> yes im trying, now :)
[11:23:15] <tman> how do you reference the object and not the jquery selector?
[11:23:22] <tman> [0] ?

[11:23:37] <tman> k thx
[11:24:19] <skylamer`> cfurrow but is this on the paste have something similar with what im trying to do ? :D)

[11:26:55] <skylamer`> phlp oh thank you :)
[11:27:20] <GeoDud> anyone have a good widget/data entry convention for a date that may be in mm/dd/YYYY format w/time where everything except year is optional?

[11:29:54] <ccmonster> Hey guys - http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/Xce6W/  trying to clean up this menu. When it loads, its funny until i click the categories header the 2nd time and reshow the menu. Any clue why this is?
[11:31:55] <beakybal4> hi all
[11:32:06] <beakybal4> anyone here got uploadify working on their site?
[11:32:23] <cfurrow> ccmonster, weird. looks like some css weirdness until you show/hide a second time... hmm
[11:32:31] <phlp> ccmonster: $('nav#list > ul').toggle();
[11:32:34] <ccmonster> yea, and I am not sure why.
[11:32:55] <ccmonster> why phlp ?
[11:32:57] <ccmonster> i do that
[11:33:09] <cfurrow> sexy phlp
[11:33:15] <phlp> no, use > for direct children
[11:33:24] <cfurrow> ccmonster, You were applying the toggle to all uls below, not just the first one
[11:33:32] <ccmonster> ah woops
[11:33:39] <ccmonster> that appeared to do the trick
[11:33:53] <ccmonster> i should probably be using the menubar, but it wouldnt act right, so I just did the 'menu'
[11:33:58] <jaequery> anyone know a good copy/paste jquery plugin?
[11:34:05] <jaequery> i can't seem to find one that actually works!
[11:35:38] <ccmonster> nope.
[11:35:48] <ccmonster> actual clipboard copy paste requires flash I believe
[11:36:20] <egnomeidde>  jaequery is that your name on twitter too?
[11:37:19] <serio> he be talkin to you egnomeidde

[11:38:01] <geekbuntu__> beakybal4, did anyone ever answer you?
[11:38:13] <beakybal4> nope :(
[11:38:32] <geekbuntu__> beakybal4, i tried them all (literally) - you should check out blueimp uploader
[11:38:43] <geekbuntu__> he has a github repo
[11:38:44] <jaequery> @egno yes, why are you eddie monge?
[11:38:56] <beakybal4> geekbuntu__: mmm k
[11:38:59] <eddiemonge> yup
[11:39:05] <beakybal4> yeah im on it
[11:39:20] <geekbuntu__> beakybal4, also, if you want to include text + multipart - it's capable of doing that also
[11:39:27] <geekbuntu__> just have to physically map the data object
[11:39:34] <jaequery> hah lol so i think this is where i found you, i was wondering how i got your twitter handle :)
[11:39:43] <geekbuntu__> beakybal4, but he has decent instructions on his wiki page
[11:40:22] <beakybal4> yeah reading that now
[11:40:36] <jaequery> eddiemonge: i saw that you were looking for a job so i got a little interested
[11:40:46] <eddiemonge> pm details?
[11:43:22] <Kambfhase> is contains jQuery specific or does it work with QSA, too?
[11:44:57] <beakybal4> geekbuntu__: it needs to work on IE
[11:45:04] <beakybal4> geekbuntu__: thats why i was using uploadify
[11:45:16] <geekbuntu__> beakybal4, ours works in ie
[11:45:27] <geekbuntu__> beakybal4, does he say it does not now?
[11:45:38] <beakybal4> no progress bar or multi upload
[11:45:58] <geekbuntu__> we're using ie9 - maybe that's why(?) it works
[11:46:06] <beakybal4> hmmm
[11:46:06] <beakybal4> n
[11:46:07] <beakybal4> ed
[11:46:13] <beakybal4> *needs to work on IE7
[11:46:31] <Taggnostr> I'm doing something like offset = $('#foo').offset(); window.scrollTo(offset.left, offset.top), except that I only want to scroll vertically. What can I put instead of offset.left?
[11:46:48] <geekbuntu__> beakybal4, uploadify isn't bad - just found lots of conflicting documentation when i was working on it
[11:47:07] <beakybal4> geekbuntu__: thanks for your help mate, imma bookmark that github and check back in here tomorrow
[11:47:12] <beakybal4> geekbuntu__: appreciated! :)
[11:47:16] <geekbuntu__> beakybal4, very welcome
[11:47:19] <Unode|Work> can someone explain to me the interface of the .click() function? I'm trying to use .click({"option": "value"}, my_handler), where handler is defined as function myhandler(obj, option) but I always get option = undefined inside the handler
[11:48:34] <phlp> Taggnostr: window.scrollTo(window.pageXOffset, offset.top)
[11:48:40] <eddiemonge> ?click @ Unode|Work
[11:48:40] <bot-t> (4 mins 46 secs ago) <gnarf> tell eddiemonge yup - Frang is my last name
[11:48:41] <bot-t> Unode|Work, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[11:48:52] <Unode|Work> according to the page http://api.jquery.com/click/ it should work along these lines
[11:49:02] <Kambfhase> Unode|Work: you get the option via event.data.option
[11:49:09] <Taggnostr> phlp, does window.pageXOffset work cross browser?
[11:49:14] <Kambfhase> Unode|Work: http://api.jquery.com/event.data/
[11:49:21] <Unode|Work> Kambfhase, thanks
[11:49:24] <ccmonster> No clue why this is failing now, http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/Xce6W/1/
[11:49:28] <ccmonster> i assume it's css
[11:49:33] * gnarf laughs at eddiemonge - sorry didn't realize you had just parted
[11:50:34] <phlp> Taggnostr: this has some crossbrowser notes at the bottom https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.pageXOffset
[11:50:35] <Taggnostr> phlp, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.pageXOffset redirects to window.scrollX
[11:50:59] <DoctorDarren> Hey, I have a row of tabs similar to a navigation bar. When one is clicked I want to give it the class "selected" with addClass. But what's the best way to find and remove the currently selected tab's "selected" class?
[11:51:05] <Taggnostr> phlp, ok
[11:51:06] <eddiemonge> gnarf: yeah. it sometimes gets hard to concentrate with ot open.
[11:51:26] <gnarf> eddiemonge: strange, thats how I feel about #jquery ;)
[11:51:32] <DoctorDarren> I'm thinking of something like $('.selected').removeClass('selected')   and then just addClass on the clicked one.
[11:51:36] <eddiemonge> DoctorDarren: $('tabs.selected').removeClass('selected')
[11:51:48] <DoctorDarren> eddiemonge: Perfect thanks
[11:51:55] <eddiemonge> gnarf: yeah but im running some long scripts so i thought id troll in here while i wait for them
[11:52:01] <gnarf> DoctorDarren: are the all siblings of the clicked element?
[11:52:19] <Unode|Work> Kambfhase, thanks that works. Though I didn't find any reference to event.data on the .click() api page
[11:52:27] <gnarf> DoctorDarren: cuz use ?siblings if thats the case, otherwise, feel free to $() / removeClass
[11:52:27] <bot-t> DoctorDarren, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[11:52:46] <Kambfhase> Unode|Work: no problem, no you know :)
[11:52:51] <Kambfhase> *now
[11:53:03] <Unode|Work> yup
[11:53:23] <KWhat_Work> is there a way to output the html of a jquery objet
[11:53:28] <Unode|Work> Kambfhase, now I need to figure out how to know the element that was clicked
[11:53:40] <Kambfhase> this
[11:53:41] <DoctorDarren> gnarf: I don't think so, it's just 12 of these:  <a href="#">Tab Name</a>
[11:54:07] <DoctorDarren> Although I suppose now with jQuery I don't need it to be an <a>
[11:54:46] <Unode|Work> Kambfhase, ah perfect "this" rocks :P
[11:54:53] <ccmonster> ok this is odd. It doesnt work right now.
[11:54:57] <Kambfhase> :)
[11:54:59] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/Xce6W/1/
[11:55:00] <eddiemonge> KWhat_Work: console.log( $(ele).get(0) )
[11:55:22] <eddiemonge> DoctorDarren: you should keep that for compatibility
[11:55:45] <DoctorDarren> eddiemonge: Yeah that's the only reason I could think of
[11:57:07] <jeffsmykil> If I want to compare a new Date(); and a date what format does the date have to be in?
[11:57:21] <jeffsmykil> i would guess both ms?
[11:58:18] <jeffsmykil> but im not sure how to find the number of ms between now and midnight this morning
[11:59:28] <Kambfhase> jeffsmykil: did you try subtracting?
[11:59:55] <phlp> ccmonster: appears to be jquery lint causing the problem. uncheck it on the left and it works
[12:00:00] <jeffsmykil> kambfhase that's beyond me!  besides how do i figure out the number of ms since 1970 of midnight this morning
[12:00:18] <ccmonster> hmm strange again
[12:00:20] <jeffsmykil>  i cant use getTime on a normal variable right?
[12:00:48] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: thats a basic javascript question. you really should learn javascript
[12:00:59] <Kambfhase> the Date object is a fucker
[12:01:14] <eddiemonge> ?eval new Date();
[12:01:15] <bot-t> eddiemonge: <2011-06-01T19:01:08.068Z>
[12:01:36] <phlp> ?js Date.parse('06/01/2011 12:00 AM') @jeffsmykil
[12:01:36] <bot-t> jeffsmykil: 1306866600000
[12:01:56] <jeffsmykil> ah parse
[12:03:01] <jeffsmykil> that and the format were throwing me thanks phlp
[12:03:19] <clockwize> hey, a get request that returns json shows in chrome network tab as 200, shows valid json but my success callback is not getting called, i attach a callback to .error() on the resulting object (from a $.get) which gets called but I don't know what the error is...
[12:03:24] <clockwize> is it passed in to this method some how?
[12:03:40] <jeffsmykil> chrome is wonky
[12:03:43] <Taggnostr> phlp, using window.pageXOffset/scrollX seems kind of messy, so I just used 0 (the page shouldn't be scrolled horizontally anyway), thanks anyway for the answer though
[12:03:46] <jeffsmykil> needs to be up on a server iirc
[12:04:30] <eddiemonge> clockwize: yes. see ? .error
[12:04:30] <bot-t> clockwize, .error(handler): Bind an event handler to the "error" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/error/
[12:04:49] <clockwize> yeah, i tried that, it gets called
[12:04:57] <clockwize> but i can't find how it provides me with details of the error
[12:05:39] <eddiemonge> clockwize: oops ignore that. do  error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) { console.log ( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) }
[12:06:09] <clockwize> i'll give that a try :)
[12:06:15] <clockwize> weird it's working locally but not on heroku
[12:06:50] <clockwize> or maybe its because it's not in a facebook iframe locally
[12:06:58] <clockwize> it worked at some point though :D
[12:07:25] <amid_hasan> i need to scroll though list items one by one, just as in wsj scroller. any ideas?
[12:09:09] <eddiemonge> ?carousel @ amid_hasan
[12:09:09] <bot-t> amid_hasan, Roundabout is a jQuery plugin that converts a structure of static HTML elements into a highly customizable turntable-like interactive area. (And now, not just turntables, but many shapes!) http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout/
[12:09:22] <clockwize> hmm.. apparently invalid json..... strange as it's converted from Ruby objects
[12:09:31] <clockwize> s/converted/serialized
[12:09:35] <clockwize> shouldn't happen? heh
[12:09:40] <clockwize> thanks for help guys
[12:11:32] <clockwize> ah.. i got a NaN
[12:11:45] <clockwize> maybe that isn't supported in JSON
[12:13:25] <clockwize> that would appear to be it.
[12:13:57] <zanberdo> I am including jquery 1.5.1.min into my web page. I have calling $(document).ready( function() {alert('foo');}); in a <script> block within my page. FF 3.x makes the call as expected, but IE7, 8 or 9 all seem to ignore it and do nothing. I don't get an error, it just never fires. Is there something specific to make this work for IE?
[12:16:50] <nurey> i'm looking for an item picker for jquery. something like this but i don't need the treeview http://jquery-groupeditempicker.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/index.html#
[12:17:27] <ryanneufeld> ?p zanberdo
[12:17:27] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[12:17:37] <ryanneufeld> ?p @zanberdo
[12:17:38] <bot-t> zanberdo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[12:19:07] <nurey> is there a modern design pattern for an item picker. ie. selecting items from a list of available items
[12:20:09] <ccmonster> so on my jquery menu implementation, the submenus aren't firing
[12:20:21] <ccmonster> the top level shows perfectly, but not the sub/flyout menus
[12:24:01] <mipo> hi
[12:24:47] <ccmonster> yea, so that's confusing why the submenu show/hide isn't firing, but it does fine in jsfiddle.net
[12:27:20] <Fricati> Hey all, is it possible to make Deferred wait second time for resolve?
[12:28:50] <ajpiano> Fricati, a deferred can only be resolved/rejected once
[12:29:26] <Fricati> thank you a lot. and there is no way to restart it?
[12:29:39] <ajpiano> not sure what you mean by "restart"
[12:29:44] <ajpiano> you can use this, potentially
[12:29:52] <ajpiano> ?Deferred.pipe
[12:29:53] <bot-t> ajpiano, deferred.pipe() - Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[12:30:07] <zanberdo> ryanneufeld, n/m. it seems I'd omitted a '>' in my script definition. FF seems to have been okay with it by IE wasn't - non-issue.
[12:30:40] <Fricati> thanks, I'm reading ...
[12:31:00] <MoTiOnXml> i can't get the live() to work
[12:31:10] <MoTiOnXml> no js errors, it's just not catching anything on descending elements
[12:31:13] <MoTiOnXml> weirdness
[12:31:28] <ccmonster> sup ajpiano , I have no clue why, but i am using the jquery ui menu feature and the top level menus show, but the sub menus on the flyout do not. Any clue why?
[12:31:37] <ajpiano> nope
[12:31:52] <Kambfhase> ?p @ MoTiOnXml
[12:31:52] <bot-t> MoTiOnXml, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[12:32:26] <ccmonster> anything i should be looking for? it works perfectly in my js fiddle
[12:32:39] <ajpiano> ccmonster, i didn't know flyout support had even landed in the current menu
[12:33:51] <ccmonster> hmm. well here it is in my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/Xce6W/12/
[12:34:08] <MoTiOnXml> http://jsfiddle.net/mjzrT/
[12:34:16] <MoTiOnXml> very simple, i know :)
[12:34:45] <Unode|Work> In jquery UI is it possible to control the direction of the slide effect?
[12:35:08] <MoTiOnXml> works with div
[12:35:15] <Unode|Work> i.e. sliding -> or sliding <- both for show() and hide()?
[12:35:57] <Kambfhase> MoTiOnXml: .live() needs a selector.
[12:36:24] <Kambfhase> $('div').live('click', ... ) << like this
[12:36:27] <ajpiano> ccmonster, i donnom you could be nested the data improperly
[12:36:36] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: ah
[12:38:38] <cgcardona> can someone help with this plugin issue? http://pastebin.com/FNjrvjRR I am having trouble getting my plugin code to both accept a settings object as well as have other $.fn functions namespaced within it. Please see pastebin for a more in depth explanation. You can see the actual plugin code here: https://audiofile.cc/js/audiofile.0.1.9.js The custom functions are at the top of the code.
[12:39:11] <NackNick> whats the correct function to wrap a div tag inside of another div tag
[12:39:11] <ThiefMaster> hi, i'm looking for a jquery-based overlib-like tooltip script. any suggestions? an important thing for me is that i need to be able to specify custom HTML - i.e. not just a plaintext tooltip.
[12:39:54] <NackNick> for example <div class="blah"><h3>content here</h3></div> h3 would be the tag that goes inside the div tag
[12:40:06] <ajpiano> cgcardona, you should consider using a) valid syntax for an object literal
[12:40:10] <ajpiano> and b) the jquery ui widget factory
[12:40:17] <ajpiano> that will give you the style of invocation your'e looking for
[12:40:22] <ajpiano> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory, cgcardona
[12:41:02] <ajpiano> cgcardona, the other option is to do type checking on your arguments
[12:41:11] <ajpiano> which happens all over jquery and jquery ui
[12:41:18] <ajpiano> for methods that have multiple signatures
[12:42:02] <ccmonster> well the data in the fiddle is straight copy/pasted from my page.
[12:42:09] <ccmonster> it works in fiddle, and borks in page
[12:42:13] <ccmonster> so im a tad confused.
[12:42:23] <Kambfhase> ccmonster: ist you page live?
[12:42:47] <ccmonster> ah|, no it's local else I would just show that
[12:42:47] <MoTiOnXml> how do i select all a's that has text?
[12:42:51] <cgcardona> ajpiano: thanks for the response. Regarding invalid syntax: I thought I followed the example here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Namespacing. What is incorrect? Also what do you mean type checking my arguments for methods that have multiple signatures. Which method has multiple signatures? audiofile() ?
[12:43:07] <MoTiOnXml> i'd like to use the :has() selector
[12:43:11] <ccmonster> i am going to strip  out the menu piece with some of my boilerplate code and see what the effect is.
[12:43:11] <MoTiOnXml> this.element.find("a:has(:text)").live("click", function(e) {} doesn't work
[12:43:23] <ajpiano> MoTiOnXml, a:not(:empty)
[12:43:28] <Kambfhase> ccmonster: do you wait for document ready?
[12:43:35] <ccmonster> yes. yes.
[12:43:37] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: is it possible the other way around (+thanks)
[12:43:39] <ajpiano> cgcardona, an object literal looks like this
[12:43:46] <ajpiano> {foo: "bar"}
[12:43:49] <ajpiano> not {foo, bar}
[12:44:10] <ajpiano> cgcardona, yes, your function will have multiple signuatres
[12:44:10] <ccmonster> the top menu and css styling is being applied, just the sub menus not working properly but the css/ids and aria tags and such that are supposed to be on all the ul/li's are showing up in the html
[12:44:18] <Kambfhase> ccmonster: did you check that jQ finds your selections?
[12:44:18] <ajpiano> if you have one that accepts an optional object on init
[12:44:23] <ajpiano> and anotehr that routes to nested methods
[12:44:46] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: doesn't work actually - it still selects a's that are empty
[12:45:11] <ccmonster> all the css that the jquery ui menu applies are showing up so it's working, just sub menus not showing
[12:45:15] <cgcardona> ajpiano: where do I use an object that looks like the second one?
[12:45:34] <ajpiano> cgcardona, line 7 of your paste
[12:45:44] <ajpiano> cgcardona, here's a simple example of type checking in jquery https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L1195-1197
[12:45:47] <Kambfhase> MoTiOnXml: :empty checks for no children, not for no text.
[12:45:47] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: think you were thinking of :empty perhaps
[12:45:49] <ajpiano> for the shorthand event handler methods
[12:46:07] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: but the a is truly empty
[12:46:10] <ajpiano> anyhow i have to roll
[12:46:20] <cgcardona> ajpiano: d'oh. Good eye. Thankfully i've been using it the correct way in the actual code. That pastie was just a quick sketch from memory *blush*
[12:46:21] <Kambfhase> ok.
[12:46:31] <cgcardona> cool checking the link. thanks
[12:47:55] <ajpiano> cgcardona: i also suggest you investigate the widget factory
[12:49:01] <cgcardona> ajpiano: reading now
[12:49:05] <cgcardona> looks cool
[12:50:32] <deam> I'm tying to fire a function after a show('slow') has finished.. but it doesn't work any idea's? hihttp://paste.pocoo.org/show/C09vjCvYIB9GGVLmHZ80/
[12:51:27] <b1lly> lets say im using a .each() loop
[12:52:48] <b1lly> i'm trying to insert an element
[12:54:33] <b1lly> in between 2 li elements
[12:57:00] <ccmonster> ok so the ui-state-hover class is being added upon hover to the <li><a>parent</a> but nothing is occuring the <ul> that is nested in the li
[12:57:02] <b1lly> or im sorry i want to create a parent around it
[12:57:20] <MoTiOnXml> is there a standard way in html to automatically blur() anchors when they're clicked?
[12:57:31] <ccmonster> to unfocus them?
[12:57:47] <MoTiOnXml> ccmonster: well, the equivalent of .blur() basically
[12:57:59] <ccmonster> blur is essentially offFocus right?
[12:58:16] <MoTiOnXml> i guess, it removes the dashed lines
[13:00:07] <jaequery> anyone know of a good css reset for widgets?
[13:01:01] <b1lly> is there a way to dump an element into an existing element?
[13:01:05] <b1lly> or move it into
[13:01:45] <MoTiOnXml> sure
[13:01:49] <MoTiOnXml> lots of stuff in the docs :)
[13:02:44] <MoTiOnXml> what would be the best way to embed state within an html element? i used to use the rel attribute but i've seen the jQuery UI use a similar approach
[13:02:48] <mipo> how to find if a div have 1 opacity?
[13:02:53] <MoTiOnXml> the data attribute?
[13:02:54] <mipo> value
[13:02:57] <danheberden> b1lly just use append, prepend, etc
[13:03:06] <danheberden> if you want to add a node into another one, etc
[13:03:36] <b1lly> and that will move an element into a parent?
[13:03:40] <b1lly> move an existing element*
[13:03:58] <MoTiOnXml> data-* attributes?
[13:04:02] <danheberden> ?:visible @ mipo
[13:04:02] <bot-t> mipo, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[13:04:21] <danheberden> b1lly aye
[13:04:55] <mipo> danheberden yes
[13:05:06] <mipo> bot-t , I want to use if!
[13:05:15] <mipo> if($("#aaa")){  .... }
[13:05:25] <danheberden> mipo if ( $elem.is( ':visible' ) ) {
[13:05:41] <danheberden> where $elem = $( 'someSelectorOrWhatever' )
[13:06:09] <danheberden> or if $elem.css( 'display' ) === 'none' if you're after that particular thing
[13:06:24] <mipo> danheberden , thanks , that works
[13:06:25] <mipo> ;)
[13:11:11] <mipo> danheberden , solved!
[13:11:23] <thelaings> anyone know if a channel exists for classic ASP?
[13:14:14] <Unode|Work> given myvar = "left" and options = ['left', 'right'] is there any single operation that returns 'right' or 'left' depending on the value of myvar?
[13:14:45] <Unode|Work> such that if myvar = 'left' I get 'right' and vice-versa
[13:15:17] <Kambfhase> that is not pssible with arrays, no. you could use an object though.
[13:15:18] <alaing> just write an if statement?
[13:15:44] <Kambfhase> {left:"right",right:"left"}[myvar]
[13:15:54] <Unode|Work> Kambfhase, yeah that works
[13:16:34] <Unode|Work> Kambfhase, hum, is {left:"right",right:"left"} the same as {"left":"right","right":"left"}?
[13:16:41] <Kambfhase> yes
[13:17:22] <Unode|Work> interesting, I thought the first would use the variable content as key
[13:18:15] <b1lly> is there a way to check if a parent with the id of #grouped_order exists?
[13:18:39] <Unode|Work> such that: var something = "meh"; {something: "value"} would give {"meh": "value"}
[13:19:06] <Unode|Work> b1lly, .closest("#grouped_order")
[13:20:35] <cgcardona> what exactly is this syntax showing? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L1195-1197
[13:20:57] <ajpiano> cgcardona, it's showing that when a function like $("#foo").click() is called
[13:21:04] <ajpiano> if there are arguments, it binds a handler
[13:21:13] <ajpiano> if there are no arguments, it triggers the handler
[13:21:37] <ajpiano> it's a basic example of type checking on the arguments to determine how a method should proceed
[13:22:01] <cgcardona> right. I'm still trying to decipher it and figure out how to use it in my project. I just wanted to be clear exactly whats happening
[13:23:24] <cgcardona> and I would put something like that within each of my custom functions that I want to be namespaced within .audiofile() ?
[13:23:56] <cgcardona> attempting to get a prototype going right now
[13:24:23] <ajpiano> no, you'd put something like that within $.fn.audiofile itself
[13:24:32] <ajpiano> and that would delegate off to $.fn.audiofile.somemethod
[13:24:49] <cgcardona> ah, ok.
[13:28:15] <cgcardona> and how does that code relate to this? http://pastebin.com/4mq1mT0Z
[13:31:21] <ryanneufeld> cgcardona: it's sorta doing the same thing
[13:31:52] <cgcardona> ok. but the one i just pasted is causing the issue? so I need to refactor and do it the second way
[13:32:16] <cgcardona> so that I can call $("#foo").audiofile("stepUpWhole", ".notes");
[13:32:37] <cgcardona> instead of $("#foo").audiofile("", "stepUpWhole", ".notes");
[13:32:42] <danheberden> cgcardona that's a bit out of context - that is looking to see if the method argument is a cached sub on methods, otherwise it returns a new method object (presumably, via methods.init )
[13:40:20] <abjorn> http://net.tutsplus.com/quizzes/nettuts-quiz-jquery-basics/ question 10 was misleading >=(
[13:40:21] <naomi> is it possible to get the dimensions of an image while it is hidden?
[13:40:26] <naomi> using jquery â†‘
[13:40:50] <MoTiOnXml> i can't find() the following element: <a href="#" data-jsonID="{}">123</a>
[13:41:06] <abjorn> naomi: assuming the elements width and height aren't actually set to 0 then I think so, yes
[13:41:08] <MoTiOnXml> find("a[data-jsonID]") doesn't give me anything
[13:41:23] <naomi> abjorn: it's just <img src="foo.jpg" />
[13:41:26] <abjorn> naomi: but I don't guarantee it lol
[13:41:35] <naomi> abjorn: there is not html attribute set for the image
[13:41:40] <abjorn> but try .width() and .height()
[13:41:44] <naomi> tried,
[13:41:46] <naomi> both return 0
[13:41:51] <abjorn> hm then I guess not
[13:42:25] <gnarf> MoTiOnXml: just fyi... don't use uppercase attrs on data-*
[13:42:29] <abjorn> afaik the DOM api isn't given much knowledge about an images actual dimensions
[13:42:45] <gnarf> MoTiOnXml: spec is data-json-id === jsonId
[13:43:00] <gnarf> it toLowerCase() / then camel cases on the -'s
[13:43:23] <gnarf> try a[data-jsonid]
[13:44:01] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/gmEGm/
[13:49:07] <naomi> is it possible to resize an image (while maintaining proportions) using jQuery?
[13:50:22] <phlp> $('img').css({width: 50, height: 'auto'});
[13:51:11] <MoTiOnXml> what is the best way to access the widget instance inside a function bound with live()?
[13:51:16] <alaing> anyone here got experience with classic asp
[13:51:40] <MoTiOnXml> and i don't want to bind(this) on the function
[13:52:42] <naomi> thanks
[13:54:18] <MoTiOnXml> what is the best way to access vars inside a widget from a bound function?
[13:55:36] <MoTiOnXml> right .. create a local ref and create a closure
[13:56:24] <Aristata> If I have a bunch of divs called '.list', and I want to check each of their heights and then do something based on the height, how would that look?
[13:56:37] <Aristata> $('.list').each or something?
[13:59:44] <LeaFlashDev> hey guys to replace the test on a div what do you advice to use ?

[14:02:18] <LeaFlashDev> thanks ! but If I need to replace the text on my div and add some other html tg , should I use .html(); ?
[14:02:34] <skamikaze> then yes
[14:02:42] <LeaFlashDev> ok thanks !

[14:11:44] <progrock> anyone got any cool trick to imitate page-break-inside: avoid; in webkit?
[14:19:59] <dabear> people
[14:20:10] <dabear> I need to highlight an entire table row.
[14:20:15] <dabear> what color would be best?
[14:20:27] <dabear> background color that is
[14:20:50] <ccmonster> so its official. I have no clue what is going on
[14:21:01] <dabear> I currently use #E9967A
[14:21:27] <orolo> i need an event to fire when a <span> inside of a <div> is clicked (toggle icon); and a different event to fire when the parent is clicked.
[14:21:46] <orolo> when i click the 'child', both events appear to be firing.
[14:22:18] <dabear> orolo: this is called event bubbling.
[14:22:29] <orolo> ?eventbubbling
[14:22:32] <bot-t> orolo, #1948 (handle(): Stop event bubbling for other jQuery handlers ... - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1948

[14:22:53] <orolo> dabear: ah. thanks.
[14:23:01] <eveningsky> #git
[14:23:15] <ccmonster> for the life of me I cannot get the jquery ui menu working
[14:23:20] <dabear> orolo: .check to see if event.target inside the listener is an anchor or a div
[14:23:46] <dabear> .click(function(event){ event.target will be different here, depending on the element being clicked })
[14:25:03] <ccmonster> http://fiddle.jshell.net/buttersrugby/Xce6W/12/show/# works fine
[14:25:09] <ccmonster> the same thing in chrome locally does not
[14:26:37] <orolo> dabear: indeed, the event.targets are different; but how do i stop the bubbling of the parent click event to the child, when the child is clicked?
[14:27:22] <skamikaze> orolo: events bubble up, not down
[14:27:36] <cgcardona> can anyone point me to another example of a plugin that has multiple functions properly namespaced on $.fn that also takes an object of settings?
[14:27:36] <orolo> makes sense.
[14:27:38] <skamikaze> ?stopPropagation @ orolo
[14:27:39] <bot-t> orolo, event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[14:28:20] <KWhat_Work> when using .bind('eventname.something', function()  what is the .something part mean?
[14:28:46] <skamikaze> KWhat_Work: an event namespace
[14:28:48] <Connor__> That element with a class
[14:28:49] <orolo> child is the incorrect relationship.
[14:28:57] <orolo> i guess 'inner span'.
[14:29:12] <orolo> dabear, skamikaze worked. thank you.
[14:29:53] <KWhat_Work> skamikaze: so if I am not using event.namespace there is no need?

[14:30:44] <KWhat_Work> nice
[14:32:49] <nbari> hi all, I have this data in json format: http://pastebin.com/buZZf5R6 the one I parse with php and generate an html tree using ul/li but wondering it the tree can be generated using jquery instead of buiding the tree on the server and geting it using a second ajax request
[14:33:31] <nbari> the array format (json) containingthe tree is like this: key_id => (depth_of_tree, html_value)
[14:34:31] <Connor__> Why would you choose jQuery over PHP? Seems a suitable job for PHP
[14:35:02] <nbari> to avoid 2 ajax requests
[14:35:03] <andoresu> In this example http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Droppable#overview-example How can I get the information of the "drag me" element when I drag in into the "drop me" element?
[14:35:27] <nbari> with the first ajax request I get the json data with the one I build a select menu the one I would like to reutilize
[14:35:57] <nbari> but instead of displaying the list like -cat1 --subcat ---subcat I would liketo use <ul><li> etc
[14:36:34] <Connor__> Hm
[14:37:42] <nbari> with this i build the html select menu: 	$.each(data, function(key, value) {var spc = value[0] > 1 ? Array(value[0] * 1).join('-') + ' ' : '';	var row = '<option value="' + key + '">' + spc + value[1] + '</option>';$(row).appendTo('select#parent');	});
[14:38:30] <nbari> but for doing the html menu I need an static var the one i do not know if in jquery is possible
[14:39:02] <nbari> otherwise i have to crete the html tree (<ul></li>..) on the server and fetch it with a second ajax the one I would like to avoid
[14:39:04] <progrock> wait, what?? you are not sure if jQuery supports a static var??
[14:39:50] <nbari> mmm yes, i do not know if with jquery I could to this code: http://pastebin.com/buZZf5R6
[14:40:13] <ThiefMaster> the language is called javascript. jquery is just a library
[14:40:22] <ThiefMaster> and javascript doesn't support static vars
[14:40:39] <nbari> oh ok
[14:41:00] <ThiefMaster> but simply define the var outside of the loop
[14:41:26] <nbari> like an global var ?
[14:41:35] <ThiefMaster> no. globals suck :)
[14:41:42] <ThiefMaster> simply in the scope of whatever function contains your code
[14:41:57] <progrock> umm, everything you are doign is in global scope.. so all your VARs are currently global....
[14:42:48] <nbari> sorry the confusion is just that I am more custom to php and many times tend to undertood javascipr/jquery like php
[14:43:28] <progrock> lol, umm, your code doesnt even look like php.. it looks like BASIC or some other shit thats not making use of fucntional or oo style coding
[14:43:29] <KWhat_Work> So inside the my widgets _create function i do something like this.myItem = $('div').  Now if i add a .bind('click' in the create function that works as expected, but if bind after I add crap to that div I can no longer get click events and i am not sure why
[14:43:48] <nbari> at the end is a simple foreach
[14:44:05] <nbari> with very few conditions based on the array so it can generate the html tree
[14:44:25] <nbari> but used a static var to maitain the depth of the previos tree so based on that i can know where to open/close the ul/li tags
[14:44:30] <KWhat_Work> does append inherit listeners ?
[14:45:37] <nbari> I will try to use the jquery.each since the code in php is very simple maybe can be eazy replicated with jquery
[14:48:27] <blackboard> Yo coldhead
[14:53:18] <ccmonster> hmm, i want to do a jquery splitbutton where the dropdown button allows me to select an item, and the submit piece of the split button runs that selection
[14:53:22] <ccmonster> any direction there/
[14:53:42] <ssfsam> $(".mydiv").hover(...$(".menu-item",this).slideDown<<< is the keyword "this" correct syntax?
[14:55:04] <ssfsam> i thought it would not have ",this" ?
[14:57:22] <Azelphur> Hey, I'm trying to get this example to work, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/333664/simple-long-polling-example-code I changed the URL to point at a different port running a python BaseHTTPServer, this works fine (the page it's polling loads in chrome), but when I try and use jquery to grab the page, I just get "error ()", any ideas?
[14:57:36] <Azelphur> It's weird because there's not anything in errorThrown, it's just saying "error ()" :(
[14:58:41] <abjorn> http://hannahmontana.sourceforge.net/Site/Home.html why does this exist
[14:58:59] <ryanneufeld> abjorn: why did you find it?
[14:59:05] <Azelphur> ^
[14:59:06] <abjorn> was linked in another irc
[14:59:10] <abjorn> and now im wondering
[14:59:13] <abjorn> why that guy found it...
[14:59:14] <Azelphur> lol
[14:59:22] <ajpiano> coldhead is a big fan of hannah montana linux
[14:59:41] <abjorn> I shouldn't be surprised
[15:01:05] <Azelphur> hannah montana aside, anyone got any ideas on my issue? :P
[15:01:05] <GeoDud> @abjorn now I've seen it all, shut the Internet down
[15:01:15] <abjorn> ajpiano: it's debian-based so I'm sure he IS a big fan
[15:01:42] <KWhat_Work> why doesnt .append do anything?
[15:02:07] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: nocturnal self contact
[15:02:41] <ryanneufeld> you're gonna have to be more specific than that
[15:03:19] <ryanneufeld> abjorn: check the faq, it explains why they created it lol
[15:03:31] <KWhat_Work> $('div').wrap(someobj); someobj.append('<p>Test</p>');
[15:03:35] <Azelphur> ah, that's kinda irritating, I think it's erroring because I'm getting data from a different port :/

[15:05:14] <Azelphur> \o/
[15:05:40] <Pierro> hai anyone have an android here ?
[15:05:47] <Azelphur> Pierro: I do.
[15:05:47] <KWhat_Work> ryanneufeld: that appended to what got rapped not the wrapper its self
[15:05:57] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: also, I'm pretty sure that you're doing it wrong
[15:06:07] <azoff_> I was using$('.rj-widget-embed').bind('click focus', function(event) {

[15:06:55] <Pierro> Azelphur: when you scroll down a page and you touch the satut bar on the top of android does it get you back a the top of the page ? (like on ios)
[15:07:13] <ryanneufeld> blackboard: tried console.log(input[1]) ?
[15:07:49] <Azelphur> Pierro: when you scroll down on android, there is no status bar. the whole screen is used for showing the page
[15:07:55] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: WTF is this supposed to do: self.fileboxWidget.wrap(self.fileboxWidget);
[15:08:05] <ryanneufeld> wrap it in itself? inception
[15:08:06] <ryanneufeld> ?
[15:08:12] <KWhat_Work> typo
[15:08:13] <KWhat_Work> one sec
[15:08:18] <Azelphur> Pierro: the bar acts like part of the page, when you scroll down it disappears off the top of the screen :)
[15:08:33] <stefancrs> hey, I got a form select tag, and next/previous buttons next to it. How would I make it so that I advance to the next/previous value, if one exists?
[15:08:39] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: inception++
[15:08:55] <KWhat_Work> ryanneufeld: thats what it was suppose to be http://paste.pocoo.org/show/399149/

[15:09:23] <Pierro> Azelphur: mm ok so they are no way to go on the top fast ?
[15:09:47] <azoff_> preferably a way that ensures that the user cannot delete any text, while still allowing them to copy via ctrl+c
[15:09:48] <Azelphur> Pierro: sure there is, just swipe upwards and you'll hit the top of the page very fast :)
[15:09:57] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work:
[15:10:03] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: your still doing the same thing
[15:10:17] <ryanneufeld> just using a different reference
[15:10:17] <Pierro> the scrolling is more fast than ios ? (because my pages is very long)
[15:10:38] <gnarf> vladikoff: yer @ is showing ;)
[15:10:48] <KWhat_Work> i want to wrap the fileboxElement with the fileboxWidget and then add crap to the widget ...
[15:11:16] <ryanneufeld> what is the value of fileBoxElement?
[15:11:19] <ryanneufeld> is it a string?
[15:11:33] <KWhat_Work> ryanneufeld: basically its an input type=file
[15:11:34] <ryanneufeld> ?wrap
[15:11:35] <bot-t> .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[15:11:53] <ryanneufeld> you can't wrap in an input
[15:12:01] <ryanneufeld> cause they don't have children
[15:12:11] <Pierro> anyway thanks a lot Azelphur i have to change interface for android user ^^
[15:12:12] <KWhat_Work> ryanneufeld: no the input is going inside a div
[15:12:26] <Pierro> you save me a lot of time
[15:12:28] <KWhat_Work> fileboxWidget == <div>
[15:12:30] <Azelphur> :)
[15:12:40] <ryanneufeld> the string "<div>"
[15:12:47] <KWhat_Work> so i would like to end up with <div>input<p>test</p></div>
[15:13:03] <ryanneufeld> okay
[15:13:05] <Azelphur> Pierro: also for testing purposes I suggest you download the android emulator, it's pretty quick/painless to set up and would be handy no doubt :)
[15:13:38] <Pierro> i will try it now :)
[15:13:58] <ccmonster> is there a way to use the position pieces of jquery Ui on any jquery element natively?
[15:14:13] <erichynds> yep
[15:14:28] <innociv> Hm.  A marketting company has had a domain that I want for 12 years.  It's completely blank.
[15:14:36] <erichynds> $("#foo").position(), ccmonster
[15:14:50] <gnarf> innociv: have fun trying to buy it from the evil campers
[15:14:52] <gnarf> :)
[15:15:01] <innociv> This should be illegal. Gr.
[15:15:07] <blackboard> Is there anything wrong with this if($.inArray(parsed_input[0], departments) > -1){
[15:15:15] <gnarf> innociv: hey - did you ever figure out whatever coldhead was recommending $.Color for the other night?
[15:15:34] <gnarf> and/or did you see this: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/
[15:15:42] <Pierro> mm Azelphur on the emulator the statut bar don't go away (it's a webapp based on jquerymobile)
[15:15:46] <innociv> gnarf, things like if you get .css('color') on something that has color:transparent; it's 3 different things on 3 different browsers
[15:15:56] <erichynds> blackboard the syntax is correct
[15:15:59] <innociv> it returns transparent on firefox, none on IE, rgba(0,0,0,0) on chrome
[15:16:07] <blackboard> erichynds Its not working though
[15:16:09] <blackboard> Hmm
[15:16:14] <gnarf> innociv: yes, it is... $.Color(elem, 'color').is("transparent") works ;)
[15:16:17] <innociv> And converting RGB to RGBA i think he said.
[15:16:17] <Azelphur> Pierro: interesting, it goes away for me. It may be because I'm running CyanogenMod
[15:16:31] <Azelphur> but CM is obviously too huge to not support xD
[15:16:33] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: try $(input).wrap("div"); $(input).after("<p>");
[15:16:35] <erichynds> perhaps the value of parsed_input[0] isn't inside the array departments? hard for me to debug that any deeper than syntax, blackboard
[15:16:37] <innociv> That's cool.  I'll probably find something to use it for at some point.
[15:16:55] <stefancrs> anyone? is there a way to set a form select's value to the next?
[15:16:59] <blackboard> Okay its returning false erichynds
[15:17:04] <iateadonut> if you're using draggable to change the position of a div, how can you grab the style "left" and "top" value?
[15:17:09] <erichynds> $.inArray doesn't return false
[15:17:28] <blackboard> console.log($.inArray(parsed_input[0], departments) > -1);
[15:17:33] <blackboard> That returned false
[15:17:42] <erichynds> right
[15:17:50] <blackboard> var departments = ["development","design","business"];
[15:17:54] <blackboard> That is the array
[15:18:08] <blackboard> and the value of parsed_input[0] in console is just design
[15:18:25] <erichynds> ?eval $.inArray( "design", ["development","design","business"] );
[15:18:26] <bot-t> erichynds: 1
[15:18:35] <blackboard> lol
[15:18:40] <pifantastic> pwned
[15:18:44] <Pierro> http://uppix.net/e/c/2/881e919a5befd6ca686e6df608e01.html Azelphur to be sure it's where it's yellow i was talking about ^^
[15:18:44] <erichynds> perhaps the array isn't what you think it is?
[15:19:01] <blackboard> you mean parsed_input[0] ?
[15:19:08] <erichynds> either/or i suppose
[15:19:15] <Azelphur> Pierro: that's the notification area, has nothing to do with apps whatsoever and apps can't hook you clicking on it :)
[15:19:23] <jacobolus> a bunch of images on the jquery homepage (e.g. http://jqueryui.com/images/book_jQueryUI17.png) are throwing 403s
[15:19:31] <pifantastic> blackboard: maybe parsed_input[0] has whitespace around it?
[15:19:33] <jacobolus> erm, the jquery UI homepage
[15:19:58] <Azelphur> Pierro: also hiding the notification bar in the browser is an option, which is why mine isn't there :)
[15:19:58] <blackboard> yes it does pifantastic
[15:20:02] <blackboard> Didn't think of that
[15:20:10] <erichynds> +1 internets to pifantastic
[15:20:24] <voogzy> How can I remove the border around tan iframe that has been added dynamicly?
[15:20:25] <Azelphur> Pierro: also, street fighter? :D
[15:20:27] <Pierro> Azelphur: on ios it make all the app who use webkit get back on the top ^^
[15:20:34] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: you still there?
[15:20:47] <KWhat_Work> yes
[15:20:51] <voogzy> it has frameborder='0' but its ignoring it
[15:20:52] <Pierro> Azelphur: hehe i make a app for the new version Ssf4 AE
[15:20:59] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: did you try what I suggested?
[15:21:03] <blackboard> Any function to remove whitespace ?
[15:21:08] <Azelphur> Pierro: :D
[15:21:12] <KWhat_Work> trying riught now
[15:21:16] <Pierro> Azelphur: i have buy a japanese guide and i am translating it xD
[15:21:22] <erichynds> blackboard: $.trim()
[15:21:22] <Azelphur> hehe
[15:21:34] <ryanneufeld> ?trim @blackboard
[15:21:34] <bot-t> blackboard, jQuery.trim(): Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[15:21:50] <Pierro> Azelphur: i want to release it on all device for free
[15:22:02] <KWhat_Work> ryanneufeld: that seems to work.
[15:22:05] <Pierro> Azelphur: if you are interested i will tell you when it's go out
[15:22:08] <KWhat_Work> So what is the difference
[15:22:11] <blackboard> $.trim(input[1]); Right erichynds ?
[15:22:18] <erichynds> yeah
[15:22:43] <Azelphur> Pierro: what's SSF4 AE?
[15:22:50] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: well, jQuery always returns a valid jquery object when you're making changes like that
[15:23:05] <Pierro> Azelphur: Super street fighter 4 Arcade Edition
[15:23:09] <Azelphur> ah
[15:23:18] <Pierro> Azelphur: it's going out on 7 june
[15:23:22] <Azelphur> fun :)
[15:23:28] <Pierro> yeah
[15:23:37] <Pierro> evil ryu and oni look sick
[15:23:40] <ryanneufeld> so when you wrap it, it returns the thing you wrapped
[15:23:53] <Azelphur> Pierro: I kinda gave up on SF, they keep slowing it down to the point that it's ridiculously boring
[15:24:19] <Azelphur> if they go any slower with it they'll be sending you a DVD which playbacks in reverse
[15:24:31] <Pierro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_RUWj4vUG0
[15:25:00] <blackboard> All fixed cheers guy
[15:25:04] <blackboard> guys*
[15:25:05] <Pierro> Azelphur: yeah but the new(old) chara is very fast (yun and yang)
[15:25:28] <ryanneufeld> actually, what you could do is this:
[15:25:57] <ryanneufeld> self.fileboxElement
[15:25:57] <ryanneufeld> 	.addClass(fileClasses)
[15:25:57] <ryanneufeld> 	.wrap(self.fileboxWidget)
[15:25:59] <ryanneufeld> 	.append('<p>test</p>);
[15:26:06] <ryanneufeld> to have it append to the fileBoxElement
[15:27:39] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: ^^^^
[15:28:30] <KWhat_Work> yah... so what is causing me not to be able to modify the wrapper after the warp?  Do I need to reassign the var?  so for exaple self.fileboxWidget = self.fileboxElement.wrap(self.fileboxWidget) ?
[15:29:17] <ryanneufeld> you need to get a reference to the wrapping element
[15:29:21] <ryanneufeld> since you don't have that
[15:29:27] <ryanneufeld> you can't change it
[15:29:43] <ryanneufeld> and no, that won't work
[15:29:50] <KWhat_Work> ahhh ok i thought that because i assinged it earlier they were equal
[15:29:59] <ryanneufeld> cause it will return fileboxElement
[15:30:12] <ryanneufeld> what you need is fileboxElement.parent() after .wrap
[15:30:57] <iAmTheDave> is there a way to cancel jquery.autocomplete.js from popping up auto-complete information (from say a slow ajax service)
[15:31:46] <coldhead> disabled javascript?
[15:32:12] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: nope, GL
[15:32:45] <kojiro> disabled javascript ftw

[15:35:41] <voogzy> I'm going to go crazy over this one... How can i remove the border from an Iframe after it has been loaded with jquery??? IE always shows the border, no matter what i do! works fine on FF or chrome or any other browser! please help!
[15:36:48] <coldhead> iframe {border:none;}
[15:36:58] <GeoDud> iframe {display:none}
[15:37:38] <voogzy> doesnt work in IE
[15:37:49] <voogzy> css doesnt seem to have any effect
[15:37:51] <abjorn> iframe { border: fuck-off-ie; }
[15:37:56] <voogzy> :P
[15:38:08] <voogzy> tried something simmilar but nothing happened :=
[15:38:08] <GeoDud> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/65034/remove-border-from-iframe
[15:38:09] <voogzy> :09
[15:38:31] <voogzy> tried that too
[15:38:35] <voogzy> youtube generates the iframe
[15:38:38] <voogzy> i dont code it
[15:38:42] <voogzy> i just want to change it
[15:38:54] <ccmonster> any clues how to put radio buttons into jquery menu/dropdown/ul
[15:38:55] <ccmonster> ?
[15:38:58] <voogzy> removed the frameborder and added frameBorder and still nothing!
[15:39:06] <laga> hey guys. i want to fetch a HTML (tag soup) document and extract some stuff from there. any way i can get a DOM-style interface to the document with jquery? Good old plain XHR does not give me .responseXML as the document is not well-formed XML.
[15:40:37] <GeoDud> @voogzy never had this problem myself but here's an ugly hack:http://www.ninthavenue.com.au/blog/how-to-remove-the-border-from-facebook-and-youtube-widgets
[15:40:50] <GeoDud> @voogzy sounds like the border might belong to something inside the iframe
[15:41:47] <voogzy> GeoDud it shouldnt coz in all other browsers it works fine without the border... but i'll check it out anyway. tnx!
[15:42:46] <GeoDud> ok, GL
[15:43:03] <voogzy> GeoDud i think i'll use the ugly hack with the overlaping wrapper :) God why didnt i go in to crocodile wrestling or something less stressful like that :/ i hate web development for one simple reason... IE!
[15:43:20] <GeoDud> hahah
[15:43:56] <GeoDud> well Google is dropping support for IE7, FF 3.5 come August so things are moving along
[15:44:02] <GeoDud> then we'll all be whining about something else
[15:50:32] <voogzy> GeoDud the hack works like a charm :) tnx man. i dont know why i didnt think of something like that... guess i thought a normal fix would work...
[15:53:49] <GeoDud> @voogzy sweet! or maybe not so sweet, heh heh. Glad it worked
[15:55:10] <voogzy> GeoDud yeah it's not as sweet as it could be but it works... i cant believe i spent almost an entire day on something as trivial as a iframe border... :(
[15:55:30] <GeoDud> ugh...you win some, you lose some
[16:04:25] <iSurround> I love jQuery
[16:04:33] <blindMoe> I love lamp
[16:04:35] <iSurround> I'm doing such smooth, amazing things with ease
[16:04:49] <iSurround> Are you just saying things in the room blindMoe?
[16:05:23] <iSurround> Actually I have a question
[16:05:34] <iSurround> Is there a way to make an animation wait for all other animations to be finished before it starts?
[16:05:42] <iSurround> Without chaining it onto the end of another one?
[16:06:47] <ionico> hi
[16:06:54] <iSurround> hi
[16:07:27] <ionico> there is a way to sum all inputs that where dynamic created ?
[16:07:51] <iSurround> No clue what that means to be honest
[16:13:47] <abjorn> http://imgur.com/e9NGA I believe I've found my new dekstop wallpaper
[16:27:41] <azoff_> Time for "Is this possible in CSS2?": a backround image, 10px from the right of a variable width block-level element
[16:28:37] <azoff_> if 'x' is the image, then it would look like this [     x ] or  [         x ] if the box was wider
[16:28:46] <neilk_> azoff: that's not a jquery question, but yes
[16:28:58] <neilk_> look into background-position
[16:29:16] <azoff_> I know its a CSS question, but the CSS room was silent ;(
[16:29:17] <ssfsam> is this correct syntax .. $('#mydiv').innerhtml = "mycontent"
[16:30:17] <neilk_> ssfsam: use $('#mydiv').html("mycontent") not .innerhtml
[16:30:26] <neilk_> although, I think innerHTML works too.
[16:30:31] <neilk_> capitalized.
[16:31:10] <innociv> azoff_, not sure why you thought it wouldn't be, and why you didn't try since it's one line of code.
[16:32:34] <azoff_> innociv: I did try (lol)! the only thing I can do is get the image to the absolute right using 'right' as the background position, but I need an absolute padding of 10px which doesn't seem possible (as I'm reading the spec...)
[16:33:02] <azoff_> the absolute values define an offset relative to the top left
[16:33:24] <azoff_> so if the element is of variable width, this is not an effective solution
[16:33:40] <kataire> Is there a good widget/UI library for jQuery that isn't jQuery UI?
[16:33:47] <subsume> If I'm doing XHR requests using setInterval, will memory continue to fill up if I'm reusing variables?
[16:35:10] <erichynds> subsume: no, but read this: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Window.setInterval#Dangerous_usage

[16:37:43] <nerk> if I have an element that is like this <div onclick="someClickFunction('params');"
[16:38:00] <nerk> is there any way to extract "someClickFunction('params')" ?
[16:39:07] <nerk> if I do $('div.class').attr('onclick'); and dump it to console, it's a function object containing the embedded function inside an anon function
[16:39:20] <nerk> but I want the embedded function
[16:39:47] <ssfsam> fyi there is no .innerHTML in jquery
[16:40:05] <nerk> sure there is
[16:40:10] <nerk> it's aliased as html
[16:40:13] <nerk> off the jquery selector
[16:40:24] <kataire> coldhead: I guess that works. Thanks.
[16:40:51] <ssfsam> ya i mean the method .innerHTML is not there .. prob replaced by .html
[16:41:48] <imsky> 6 months baby

[17:49:40] <zorph> I love how some sites are converting textarea input to items that can be deleted...such as tumblr keywords...or email addresses..
[17:49:50] <zorph> is that a simple task for jquery?
[17:50:14] <zorph> when the comma is inputted...replace the word with a little item with a deletion x...
[17:50:34] <zorph> how is that done?
[17:50:57] <subsume> `in a text area?
[17:53:37] <zorph> ya!
[17:53:47] <zorph> all the big sites are doin it...
[17:53:59] <zorph> fb...tumblr..etc
[17:54:04] <zorph> evite...
[17:54:37] <zorph> it's like it magically separates the words into managable items..
[17:55:34] <aca20031> absolutely positioned image of an X right next to the word, probably
[17:57:09] <the_bard> why does this function ouput "undefined"? http://jsfiddle.net/NnKC7/
[18:01:18] <amid_hasan> Hello. How do I travese a jquery object array. I.e. I have an array of data. One object data array must be displayed per "page". If I click next, then the next object is loaded into page DOM?
[18:01:55] <ryanseddon> ?each @ amid_hasan
[18:02:19] <zorph> there must be a listener callback waiting for comma input...
[18:02:37] <ryanseddon> argh bot-t is not here
[18:02:38] <amid_hasan> do you have any sample code I can learn from?
[18:02:49] <ryanseddon> amid_hasan: use $.each
[18:02:55] <amid_hasan> this dilemma has been stumping me for several days
[18:03:25] <amid_hasan> so $.each would essentially traverse the array. How do I prevent all elements from showing when i click the "next" button
[18:04:38] <blackboard> Hey Guys
[18:05:17] <ryanseddon> amid_hasan: you can keep count of what you're up to and just access the array item like so: array[count]
[18:06:29] <blackboard> How do I remove the value of an array from a string?
[18:06:45] <amid_hasan> Would I add a number into a hidden div and read/increment it every time I hit "next"?
[18:07:06] <the_bard> why does this function ouput "undefined"? http://jsfiddle.net/NnKC7/
[18:09:13] <ryanseddon> the_bard: can you reproduce in your fiddle when you're calling the function that returns undefined?
[18:10:12] <amid_hasan> ryanseddon: http://jsfiddle.net/rSg5b/9/  is the code I have so far
[18:10:39] <coldhead> you don't have a final else, the_bard http://jsfiddle.net/NnKC7/1/
[18:14:58] <amid_hasan> Any help guys? http://jsfiddle.net/rSg5b/9/ Need to update div with next item in array?
[18:16:13] <ryanseddon> amid_hasan: this could be an option http://jsfiddle.net/ryanseddon/rSg5b/10/
[18:17:16] <amid_hasan> ryanseddon: that works. now i need to learn what that function is doing
[18:17:17] <blackboard> Hey coldhead :)
[18:17:31] <amid_hasan> unfamiliar with data method
[18:17:34] <amid_hasan> thank you!!

[18:19:15] <coldhead> i trust everything is all good and fixed forever now and you'vejust come to say thanks and goodbye?
[18:19:24] <blackboard> Of course :)
[18:19:36] <coldhead> good cause uh my testicular cancer is really flaring up today

[18:20:59] <blackboard> @coldhead
[18:21:02] <blackboard> :(
[18:22:43] <coldhead> try asking for help, instead of taking us on a rollercoaster ride of emotion
[18:22:49] <blackboard> :(

[18:23:21] <blackboard> There's no one there. :(
[18:23:32] <coldhead> WHAT DO YOU WANT HELP WITH SPARKY

[18:25:33] <imsky> you have testicular cancer?
[18:25:35] <blackboard> Lol.
[18:25:46] <blackboard> It seems as though the ! is not being removed.

[18:26:38] <blackboard> www.blackboarddev.com/mynt/mynt.html If you forgot, @coldhead :)
[18:27:21] <coldhead> i thought this was due yesterday, blackboard
[18:27:36] <blackboard> No, I had to leave.
[18:28:19] <coldhead> if(parsed_input[1] != null && parsed_input[1] !== ""){
[18:28:35] <coldhead> that could be if(parsed_input[1])
[18:28:53] <blackboard> but the @ gets replaced, leaving a space?
[18:29:02] <blackboard> can you remove white space from a whole array?
[18:29:15] <coldhead> not in one line
[18:29:24] <blackboard> okay
[18:29:34] <blackboard> ill fix that later cause i need to go like really soon now too lol
[18:31:30] <coldhead> so what am i fixing?
[18:32:22] <blackboard> its not remove parsed_input[0] and parsed_input[1] form input
[18:32:53] <blackboard> ive gtg, would you mind posting it in here and ill fix it when i get back sorry mate.
[18:32:55] <magn3ts> Whats the current state of the Grid?
[18:33:07] <coldhead> sure blackboard, YOU QUITTER
[18:40:16] <orolo> anybody use backbone.js in here?
[18:40:51] <orolo> i've been reading about it but i still don't quite get what it is.
[18:52:02] <ajpiano> orolo: i do
[18:52:46] <orolo> ajpiano: is it a MVC?
[18:53:02] <ajpiano> kinda
[18:53:34] <orolo> does it use sql or couch-type db?
[18:53:50] <ajpiano> it can work with whatever backend you want
[18:54:03] <ajpiano> or it can use localstorage
[18:54:13] <ajpiano> it is just client side mvc-style
[18:54:23] <orolo> hm. so is php necessary for db?
[18:54:33] <ajpiano> not necessarily
[18:55:31] <ajpiano> it's primarily for organising your client side code
[18:55:40] <orolo> ok. thanks.
[18:55:43] <ajpiano> well, entirely
[18:55:44] <ajpiano> :p
[19:02:01] <keyo> what is the easiest way to draw a line graph from a table of data. Raphael? Google Charts?
[19:03:35] <tbranyen> keyo: google charts prolly
[19:03:45] <tbranyen> graphael was never finished
[19:03:58] <tbranyen> and raphael on its own doesn't do charting, you'd need to implement it yourslef
[19:06:21] <gkatsev> highcharts
[19:06:31] <gkatsev> though, not free for commercial
[19:07:12] <coldhead> can anyone please make me chocolate cake
[19:07:32] <amid_hasan> cannot traverse backward in my array.... grhhhh http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/rSg5b/41/
[19:07:34] <coldhead> i like flot, keyo
[19:07:46] * coldhead spits on "not free for commercial"
[19:07:54] * gkatsev makes coldhead a chocolate cake then overnites it. "That'll be $150, please"
[19:08:19] <keyo> I get the feeling sencha wants you to use ext4 instead of g-raphael
[19:08:22] <coldhead> BUT I AM EATING IT FOR NON-COMMERCIAL USE!
[19:08:49] <keyo> I'm using it for non-commercial too
[19:09:05] <keyo> Google charts is silly because it's slow
[19:09:13] <keyo> another request just to grab a chart :/
[19:09:20] <coldhead> really, try flot
[19:10:22] <keyo> coldhead:  Thanks, looks perfect. Nice and simple too
[19:10:32] <coldhead> exactly :)
[19:11:18] <keyo> actually it might not be
[19:11:24] <coldhead> NO U
[19:11:34] <keyo> doesn't look like it has values on hover
[19:11:57] <keyo> you know what I mean, those labels on the points. It will be a timeline sort of thing
[19:12:47] <keyo> Oh lol, it does support that :) http://people.iola.dk/olau/flot/examples/interacting.html
[19:25:51] <codeape> hey guys, is there a way to chain selectors on a jquery object?
[19:28:38] <ngharo> yep
[19:28:41] <ngharo> what are you trying to do
[19:28:47] <codeape> I'm buliding a plugin
[19:28:49] <codeape> (first timer)
[19:29:29] <codeape> so within $.fn.functionName = function() { this } ... I'm trying to fetch elements from "this"
[19:30:11] <ngharo> you can do $('#something', this) -- this set's the selector context or see ?find
[19:30:23] <ngharo> crap bot-t dead again
[19:30:36] <codeape> oh wait
[19:30:41] <codeape> finally found what I want in the docs
[19:30:48] <codeape> this.find("selector")
[19:30:58] <ngharo> yes
[19:31:07] <codeape> derp. thanks anyway :)
[19:31:58] <keyo> Hi all. I have an element 'var table = $('<table>...</table>');'
[19:32:17] <keyo> How can I get the html for this. .text() doens't seem to work
[19:32:44] <keyo> Oh snap. There is a method called .html(). how did I not see this
[19:41:23] <letterpress> trying to figure out why var self=this now refers to the DOM window. "this" previously referred to the object itself (checkout). http://pastie.org/2006551
[19:42:28] <Anitox> line 3
[19:43:42] <letterpress> yeah well, in a function within an object, self=this has usually meant the object itself
[19:44:50] <letterpress> self=this means the checkout object in all the other functions within this object (those methods are not shown in the paste).
[19:45:54] <Anitox> what does the ,hash part do?
[19:46:21] <letterpress> i'm just declaring the variables at the top of the function
[19:46:21] <coldhead> gets you well baked
[19:46:30] <letterpress> that too
[19:50:26] <letterpress> the only thing unusual about this method is that i call this as a callback from another method. in other words, i pass through checkout.checkHash as the "callback" parameter to another function. then i fire this as "callback()"
[19:53:54] <letterpress> something like this: http://pastie.org/2006551
[19:55:46] <authorblues> Is there a way in jquery (or in basic javascript, if need be) to take a class and get something from it without styling anything in particular? Like if I want the background color specified by a class.
[19:57:00] <Anitox> you can modify your CSS to just have a class with the background you desire...
[20:00:31] <authorblues> Anitox: That doesn't address my issue.
[20:00:46] <is_null> hi all, any idea how to workaround this jquery bug ? http://dpaste.com/549466/
[20:00:58] <authorblues> I have a class name, but I need to know what its background-color element is if I were to style something. But I am not styling anythign with that class.
[20:04:07] <letterpress> but more generally i'm trying to understand why self=this would not be the object within a method of that object. this is perplexing me.
[20:07:37] <justinTNT> author: just make a dummy dom object, add the class then test the style property.
[20:08:40] <letterpress> and that's how i learned apply. ok so the function was called in the wrong scope. all's well now.
[20:10:08] <letterpress> line 10 fixed the problem http://pastie.org/2006551
[20:10:14] <authorblues> justinTNT: Tried it and worked a charm! Thanks. :D
[20:23:36] <sab0t> can anyone see anything with this code, that it wouldn't function properly in Chrome? (and only chrome)

[20:26:00] <josephnexus_1> hello everyone!
[20:26:09] <sab0t> hi
[20:26:36] <josephnexus_1> i'm using .load() and that is working wonderfully, however, I'm trying to have it call another load when that one is successful
[20:26:46] <josephnexus_1> and i'm having some trouble getting the syntax down
[20:27:06] <sab0t> jose: post your code on a jsfiddle and i will see if i can help
[20:27:09] <ngharo> sab0t: kinda weird your function args are $var but you referencing them like var
[20:27:19] <sab0t> oh
[20:27:48] <sab0t> ngharo: originally i had them as var, but threw that in right before i posted it. i'll rework it a bit, forgot to change the rest
[20:27:57] <ngharo> also it's better to cache the jquery object rather than just the DOM node
[20:28:13] <ngharo> i.e. $foo = $(foo); then use $foo for your jq operations
[20:28:19] <josephnexus_1> http://pastebin.com/9z1JM1ZL <--- there's my code
[20:29:48] <josephnexus_1> any ideas on what i've got wrong... i'm sure it is somewhere around line 5
[20:30:14] <sab0t> actually i think it's on line 4
[20:30:35] <sab0t> i believe you're missing a right parentheses between the } and ,
[20:31:06] <josephnexus_1> so line for should read }), function() {
[20:31:10] <sab0t> yes
[20:31:27] <sab0t> and with that in mind, i think you have an extra right parentheses on line 5
[20:32:02] <josephnexus_1> hmm
[20:32:08] <josephnexus_1> still no change...
[20:33:18] <yvsong> Can deferreds in $.when(deferreds) an array of Deferred objects?
[20:33:19] <josephnexus_1> http://pastebin.com/mArT6JfT shows some code with it working on another callback... i tried to model it after that
[20:34:16] <sab0t> hmmm
[20:34:27] <josephnexus_1> except, I don't want it to wait for the other element to change, I want it to just fire immediately
[20:34:33] <josephnexus_1> and that's where my confusion is
[20:34:49] <sab0t> well then don't use a callback function
[20:35:02] <sab0t> juse have to .load() one after the other, they'll both just haul ass
[20:35:09] <josephnexus_1> hmm...
[20:35:15] <josephnexus_1> i was unaware that could be done...
[20:35:21] * josephnexus_1 looks at the code....
[20:35:22] <Shai-Tan> I have a page which makes a jquery ajax call to another page. How can I pass the GET vars from the page, to the page that is being called by the ajax call?
[20:35:24] <josephnexus_1> one minute
[20:36:10] <sab0t> Shai-Tan: use $.get
[20:36:27] <sab0t> i suggest reading up on the jquery api about $.get and $.post
[20:36:58] <Shai-Tan> sab0t: thanks, will read up
[20:37:03] <yvsong>  Can deferreds in $.when(deferreds) be an array of Deferred objects?
[20:37:21] <gdpod> just learning jquery how do i add a simple function DoSomething() to http://jsfiddle.net/SRpDn/
[20:37:22] <ngharo> Shai-Tan: to get the current page get args, console.log(window.location); it's in there somewhere
[20:37:31] <sab0t> or you could do it the hacky way and manually build a get string, such that $(foo).load("bar.html?var=" + value);
[20:37:52] <Shai-Tan> that looks nasty
[20:38:33] <sab0t> it is
[20:39:03] <Shai-Tan> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[20:39:40] <sab0t> yes
[20:39:49] <sab0t> i'll do an example for you
[20:40:32] <josephnexus_1> http://pastebin.com/bjw0zc4T
[20:40:34] <josephnexus_1> i'm still stuck
[20:42:01] <sab0t> http://jsfiddle.net/MZRAX/1/
[20:42:05] <josephnexus_1> i tried placing it after line 5, but that didnt work
[20:42:50] <josephnexus_1> i've got an idea...
[20:43:46] <Shai-Tan> sab0t: I see. But how do I fetch the current url GET values? I have /history/showfield?fn=est_lat&diver_id=3&dive_id=134
[20:43:56] <Shai-Tan> I need to pass these values to the ajax call
[20:45:08] <josephnexus_1> ok, sab0t, i simply added another event handler for .change on #services, but it doesn't seem to be working.
[20:45:28] <josephnexus_1> only the first one fires...
[20:45:56] <ngharo> Shai-Tan: window.location ... inspect it
[20:47:16] <ngharo> $.ajax({url: 'foo.php', data: window.location.search, success: ... });
[20:47:30] <ngharo> i think that would work for passing current args to foo.php
[20:47:48] <ngharo> Shai-Tan: else google 'bbq deparam' for more goodies
[20:56:39] <sunscreen> http://www.phonegap.com/home/ looks interesting

[21:17:51] <thathurts> does anyone know why html() uses innerhtml?
[21:17:53] <thathurts> speed?
[21:17:59] <Edler> why ?
[21:18:02] <Edler> what do you mean why ?
[21:18:07] <Edler> what's so bad about it...
[21:18:14] <thathurts> there are browser issues with it
[21:18:22] <Edler> i don't think so...
[21:18:25] <Edler> like what issues ?
[21:18:30] <thathurts> example:
[21:19:02] <thathurts> if you remote desktop into a machine with internet explorer 7 and you try to click on an element that was created through innerhtml that has an onclick event on it, that onclick event doesn't fire
[21:19:26] <Edler> i don't think so
[21:19:28] <Edler> why wouldn't it fire ?
[21:19:29] <thathurts> but if you actually create the elements manually, those will fire
[21:19:31] <Edler> that makes no sense...
[21:19:38] <thathurts> i've observed this behavior
[21:19:43] <Edler> i don't think IE7 is that bad
[21:19:49] <Edler> i'd rather think the event was not properly binded
[21:19:53] <thathurts> there's some weirdness with ie7 and remote desktop and innerhtml
[21:19:54] <Edler> than an innerhtml problem
[21:20:06] <Edler> i don't think remote desktop changes the behavior of ie too
[21:20:10] <thathurts> nope. event works on all other browsers AND on ie7 if you don't remote desktop into a machine with it
[21:20:16] <Edler> and innerhtml is a standard in the DOM api if i'm not mistaken
[21:20:27] <Edler> who the heck will ever remote desktop anyway ?
[21:20:38] <thathurts> me when i'm testing
[21:20:42] <josephnexus_1> sab0t: thanks for all of the help! I got it figured out.
[21:20:44] <is_null> hi all, for some reason ajaxStop and ajaxLoad are not working anymore... any idea ?
[21:21:06] <Edler> it doesn't make sense
[21:21:08] <Edler> it should work the same
[21:21:12] <Edler> as if it was not remote desktop
[21:21:13] <thathurts> "should"
[21:21:15] <thathurts> the magical word
[21:21:29] <Edler> i'd rather think it's another issue causing it
[21:21:33] <Edler> and that remoting doesn't change anything
[21:21:36] <Edler> if remoting does
[21:21:38] <thathurts> well
[21:21:41] <Edler> then M$ have done a really shitty job
[21:21:47] <thathurts> when i actually log into the machine i'm remoting into
[21:21:48] <thathurts> it works
[21:21:57] <thathurts> but in the remote desktop window, the event doesn't fire
[21:21:57] <Edler> same exact web page ?
[21:21:59] <thathurts> yup
[21:22:01] <thathurts> exact same page
[21:22:19] <Edler> heh
[21:22:22] <Edler> that's extremely strange
[21:22:28] <Edler> and if that doesn't work in jquery
[21:22:33] <Edler> i bet you it will never work
[21:22:41] <Edler> why not use delegation instead of event binding
[21:22:46] <Edler> maybe that would solve the problem
[21:23:04] <Edler> try $.delegate() or $.live()
[21:23:14] <Edler> it will work
[21:23:18] <sunscreen> that hltler thing == funniest shiet ever
[21:23:39] <Edler> thathurts: you know how delegate works right ?
[21:23:53] <Edler> sunscreen: yeah, i'm getting just ready to watch Lady Java http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3qkQROb_k
[21:24:07] <Edler> hope it's good
[21:24:15] <sunscreen> "it cant ever render elements properly"
[21:24:25] <Edler> haha :P
[21:24:42] <Edler> hehe Lady Java seems good too

[21:26:45] <psilo2> you lost me at java
[21:26:47] <sdio> ah, what passes for humour in the geek world.
[21:27:07] <Edler> sunscreen: if you haven't yet, there's this awesome lonely island song that michael bolton is in, and it's like he's injected himself into the song, check it out :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY
[21:27:12] <coldhead> C is a whore
[21:27:34] <Edler> sunscreen: they're at the club, and he's singing about jack sparrow and tony montana :P
[21:27:37] <sdio> coldhead: I challenge you to a duel.
[21:27:47] <thathurts> Edler: i don't really understand delegation yet
[21:27:55] <Edler> oka
[21:28:03] <Edler> instead of adding new items with .html
[21:28:11] <Edler> then binding the click event to them specifically
[21:28:15] <Edler> you wrap them in a div
[21:28:16] <coldhead> okay sdio, pistols vs butterflies at dawn
[21:28:22] <Edler> and delegate that div to catch the events of it's childs
[21:28:29] <sdio> coldhead: I'd suggest pistols, but then your language might not let you shoot it. just in case you shoot yourself in the foot.
[21:28:30] <Edler> then add them without needing to bind to them
[21:28:37] <Edler> their parent div will catch their event
[21:28:49] <sdio> assuming everyone that uses it is a retard: JS.
[21:29:17] <Edler> sdio: wanna see a singer shooting himself in the foot ?
[21:29:31] <sdio> Edler: No.
[21:29:38] <Edler> cool
[21:29:46] <Edler> thathurts: got it ?
[21:29:56] <thathurts> yeah
[21:30:05] <thathurts> but can you parameterize delegates?
[21:30:11] <Edler> yes lemme give you the syntax
[21:30:17] <Edler> ? delegate
[21:30:46] <Edler> ?.delegate
[21:30:49] <Edler> ? .delegate
[21:30:51] <Edler> dammit
[21:31:08] <Edler> the bot isn't online ?
[21:31:09] <Edler> heh
[21:31:39] <Edler> $("#parentDiv").delegate("childSelector", "click", function(){...});
[21:31:57] <Edler> that should do it
[21:32:21] <anchovy> ?g test
[21:32:29] <Edler> not in channel
[21:32:55] <thathurts> Edler: i think i'd like to use that for some google maps stuff because right now i'm using google maps domlistener to create links which open google maps markers
[21:36:03] <thathurts> i don't know what it is
[21:36:11] <thathurts> but google maps api v3 is as slow as shit in ie7 and ie8
[21:36:15] <thathurts> the panning is choppy. it stinks
[21:37:54] <Edler> heh
[21:44:33] <Shai-Tan> I have an <input type="button" id="my_id" value="something"/> is this simply referenced with $('my_id') ?
[21:45:57] <Edler> no
[21:45:59] <Edler> it's references by
[21:46:02] <Edler> $("#my_id")
[21:49:21] <Shai-Tan> Edler: ok thanks
[21:49:30] <Edler> it's css based selectors
[21:49:47] <Shai-Tan> cool
[21:50:28] <Shai-Tan> ok, I have a bunch of input buttons, and wish to know which is pressed. Do I get them all the same name or how best to see which is clicked?
[21:51:23] <r500> i am trying to use this jquery lightbox script with scolling image marque; but then it doesnt work in combination  with marquee http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/#!prettyPhoto[pp_gal]/4/
[21:53:26] <jrockjiggz> does marquee work without lightbox?
[21:53:45] <r500> yes
[21:53:53] <r500> they both work individually
[21:54:03] <r500> marquue   &    lightbox
[21:54:16] <jrockjiggz> so marquee is depending on something that lightbox is changing
[21:54:36] <jrockjiggz> find out what lightbox depends on, and check if lightbox modifies those things
[21:55:10] <jrockjiggz> *find out what marquee depends on
[21:55:18] <r500> am using this marquee http://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee/
[21:55:33] <jrockjiggz> sorry i dont have a browser...
[21:55:42] <r500> aww
[21:56:32] <r500> i tried one marquee script with another lightbox script(scriptaculus,prototype dependent) works fine. but the script takes time to load
[21:56:39] <r500> jrockjiggz:
[21:57:05] <ngharo> does console show errors?
[21:57:28] <jrockjiggz> jquery won't throw errors
[21:57:32] <r500> no it doesnt show errors
[21:57:51] <jrockjiggz> console.log() the el
[21:58:52] <hmbg> good morning everyone. I'm looking to make a position bookmark function, i.e. save the scroll position, but independently of how the user resizes the window
[21:59:18] <r500> jrockjiggz:  what is that?
[21:59:26] <hmbg> so basically I need to somehow identify where in the text a certain scroll position is
[21:59:28] <hmbg> any ideas?
[21:59:30] <ngharo> r500: i dont see why they wouldnt work in unison.  it sounds like more of a problem with your implementation perhaps
[22:00:12] <r500> huh..!!? ngharo
[22:00:22] <ngharo> wat
[22:02:52] <ngharo> hmbg: not sure i quite follow.  you can get the current scroll position .. is that what you need?
[22:04:52] <hmbg> ngharo: say I have an ebook which consists of a loong html document, with long text nodes. I want to get where I am in the text document, and then when I open it next time, I can navigate there. The problem with just getting the scroll position is if my browser window/text container is smaller or wider, because the same scroll position will mean somewhere else in the text.
[22:05:34] <jrockjiggz> i think theres a way to detect if a container is in the viewport or not
[22:06:15] <ngharo> hmbg: if you're able to select the node, call .offset() on it
[22:06:27] <ngharo> should give you an object with left and top values
[22:06:45] <jrockjiggz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123999/how-to-tell-if-a-dom-element-is-visible-in-the-current-viewport
[22:07:25] <hmbg> jrockjiggz: works well if you have sufficiently short text in each dom element
[22:07:26] <Shai-Tan> I have a group of buttons, how do I tell which was clicked?
[22:08:16] <jrockjiggz> Shai-Tan: inside your .click() even add console.log( $(this) );
[22:08:17] <khelll> hellos, i have a selector on some link, how can i tell a click event on this link to go to the link mentioned in the href attribute?
[22:08:37] <hmbg> ngharo: don't want the user to have to select text all the time, and mousedown events only give me elements, not nodes (as far as I can tell)
[22:08:51] <jrockjiggz> khelll: how to tell if the link was clicked or ??
[22:09:12] <ngharo> hmbg: i dont mean select in that sense.  I mean selecting it via jquery .. $('some node').offset().top
[22:09:47] <khelll> $('#some_link').click(function(){//go to the link itself})
[22:10:13] <hmbg> ngharo: ok, then the problem would just be to find that node
[22:10:24] <ngharo> hmbg: yeah hmm
[22:10:42] <hmbg> may be possible to just loop through them all from the start, I wonder how it performs...
[22:10:46] <jrockjiggz> khelll: document.location( $(this).attr('href') );
[22:10:57] <Shai-Tan> jrockjiggz: I have  onclick="location.href='/femd_data/history/showfield" />
[22:10:59] <ngharo> hmbg: yeah i was thinking that too
[22:11:39] <zoggy> got a question, i have a suckerfish menu.. and in the menu i throw up a confirm prompt for yes/no.. and if the user hit's no the menu dropdown is stuck there.. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/887029/how-to-implement-confirmation-dialog-in-jquery-ui-dialog
[22:13:05] <Shai-Tan> jrockjiggz: so I should have a $('.button').click(function(){ ...
[22:14:16] <jrockjiggz> Shai-Tan: yes
[22:15:55] <jrockjiggz> Shai-Tan: http://jsfiddle.net/
[22:16:04] <jrockjiggz> sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/GuGvn/
[22:17:43] <Shai-Tan> is this syntax correct? -> data:{diver_id:$('#diver_id').value(),dive_id:$('#dive_id').value()}
[22:18:22] <ngharo> val() not value()
[22:18:28] <Shai-Tan> ahh
[22:18:29] <Shai-Tan> thanks
[22:18:30] <jrockjiggz> $('#diver_id').val()
[22:29:44] <keyo> I am trying to get the href of the link that was clicked from my fancybox method:
[22:31:23] <keyo> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/399277/
[22:31:39] <coldhead> $(this).attr('href') doesn't work?
[22:31:47] <hmbg> damn, doesnt seem  like you can get offset() from a <br> element
[22:31:59] <Edler> why would you do that ?
[22:32:04] <keyo> nope, it's inside the scope of the fancybox object. It is a callback, which fancybox calls
[22:32:09] <zoggy> keyo, var target = $( this ).attr('href');
[22:32:32] <zoggy> then to send the user to that target... location.href = target;
[22:32:35] <keyo> please see my paste above
[22:33:20] <hmbg> Edler: to find its position in the document?
[22:33:34] <keyo> Maybe I could bind another click event to that link which fires before .fancybox() ??
[22:34:06] <keyo> hmbg: yup, I want to find the position of the element in the document, exactly
[22:36:21] <hmbg> keyo: I was answering Edler, your paste is a little short to see what you're trying to do, and I'm not sure what it is that isn't working
[22:36:23] <jrockjiggz> keyo: try var selector = $(this);
[22:36:44] <keyo> this is the fancybox library
[22:36:45] <jrockjiggz> and load_chart(selector)
[22:36:58] <ngharo> keyo: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/399279/ ?
[22:39:26] <keyo> ngharo: doesn't quite work, but gave me an idea
[22:50:55] <johnpipi> anyone familiar with jquery validation
[22:51:25] <johnpipi> im using remote to validate email is used or not
[22:51:54] <johnpipi> works great but after it fails then every letter you type goes to server and makes it so can barely type input in
[22:53:33] <ngharo> hmbg: i dunno where im going with this but it may help you: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/n23B7/
[22:54:02] <hmbg> ngharo: I'm sorta going in the same direction
[22:54:49] <hmbg> ngharo: luckily it seems the ebooks use <br> elements a lot, so I insert an anchor tag after each br and store the position of that one
[22:55:05] <ngharo> nice
[22:56:42] <johnpipi> anyone?

[23:44:17] <mpathy> Hi there.. I wanted to do sth with jquery using the drag and drop stuff.. It should be easy but I wanted to know if I can somehow take the actual state and save it somehow into a static picture.. (I dnd'd elements here and there and want to make some kind of snapshot and save it).. Do I need server side stuff which is not JS or can I do this with JS and only don't know it until now? :)
[23:45:12] <ryanseddon> ?p @ mpathy
[23:45:13] <bot-t> mpathy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[23:47:50] <mpathy> ryanseddon, I am not ready yet, but my first test show that the dnd stuff is easy to do, I only want to know if there is a possibility to save what I dragged and dropped in the state where it is in a static picture. It shall be some kind of formation manager for soccer games
[23:50:44] <mpathy> I use the stuff who is displayed here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#snap-to with a selection of all formations which are normally used - only need to know the information if I can save a graphic of the state of the website (the actual rendered DOM or how I should call it) to the server
