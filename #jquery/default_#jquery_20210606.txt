[10:50:31] <Robdgreat> alexzander022[m]: what's your jquery question?
[10:50:46] <Robdgreat> since this is #jquery, not #spam
[10:51:02] <Robdgreat> maybe you got confused. It happens
[20:24:48] <sydbarret> anybody awake?
[20:24:54] <robertmaxrees> no
[20:29:16] <robertmaxrees> (sydbarret if you have a question, just ask it ;) )
[20:30:08] <sydbarret> i think its not related to jquery
[20:30:12] <sydbarret> more a css
[20:30:16] <sydbarret> let me try it first
[20:54:34] <robertmaxrees> you mean the one you posted earlier about how to update scss?
[20:56:39] <pavonia> sydbarret: If you are on libera, #css has moved to there
[20:57:23] <robertmaxrees> lolk
[20:58:15] <pavonia> O.o
