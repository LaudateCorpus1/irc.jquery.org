[00:00:00] <lintguy> Sure you can :)
[00:00:04] <Cork> cause the mac os sucks
[00:00:12] <lintguy> No it doesn't
[00:00:23] <Cork> lintguy: only if you have hardware very similar to what a mac uses
[00:00:38] <Cork> and this computer uses an amd cpu
[00:00:46] <Cork> so mac os in a vm won't even boot
[00:00:48] <lintguy> Not really, there are kexts (drivers) for most hardware these days.
[00:01:03] <lintguy> Ah, well, yeah… Amd's a nono for mac.
[00:01:14] <Cork> ya, i know
[00:01:36] <Cork> hence my comment
[00:02:00] <lintguy> Actually, it does work
[00:02:01] <lintguy> http://www.ulduzsoft.com/2014/03/running-mac-os-x-under-qemukvm-on-amd-cpu/
[00:02:10] <Cork> i don't care
[00:02:14] <lintguy> :-D
[00:02:15] <lintguy> Ok
[00:02:42] <Cork> i tried it once and it was WAY to much pain for me to ever attempt it again
[00:02:49] <lintguy> Sure, OS X is like a prison, iOS more so. But it's the most stable OS i have ever used.
[00:02:57] <Cork> mac don't want me to care about things working perfect in there os; fine
[00:02:59] <lintguy> And i was there from the start.. Windows 3.11 and NT 3.51
[00:03:10] <Cork> it will be a third rated compatibility (similar to ie8)
[00:03:31] <lintguy> C'mon, now you are just silly.
[00:03:50] <Cork> lintguy: i was in windows from its 2 years
[00:03:52] <lintguy> It's an open source unix kernel and OS at the bottom.
[00:04:08] <Cork> lintguy: ... ya, and the kernel is all that matters
[00:04:19] <Cork> just as android is "open" cause of the kernel?
[00:04:27] <Cork> both systems is closed source
[00:04:31] <lintguy> They are both closed source i know.
[00:04:39] <lintguy> But what other options does one have?
[00:04:42] <lintguy> Windows? Fuck that
[00:04:43] <Cork> they just build on a compatibility layer with the hardware that happens to be open
[00:04:49] <lintguy> It's closed from the ground up!
[00:04:56] <Cork> lintguy: linux
[00:05:06] <Cork> been my choice mainly cause of stability and control
[00:05:17] <Cork> and it is gold when you develop
[00:05:23] <lintguy> Yeah, i love linux in a way, but it can't get any fucking work done when i have to "fix" things all the time
[00:05:30] <lintguy> and just pray to the gods things don't break
[00:05:41] <Cork> lintguy: then you use the wrong distro
[00:05:48] <lintguy> what distro should i use then?
[00:05:53] <lintguy> OpenSUSE?
[00:05:55] <Cork> currently i'm on arch :)
[00:06:00] <lintguy> Ah, ok
[00:06:08] <Cork> and spend less then 5 mins a month "fiddling" with it
[00:06:14] <Cork> it mainly just work for me
[00:06:26] <lintguy> Isn't it in Arch that you have to compile everything from source?
[00:06:34] <Cork> no
[00:06:39] <lintguy> RPM?
[00:07:20] <Cork> i think you're thinking of gentoo
[00:07:23] <lintguy> Doesn't really matter though, i can't use creative suite in it or any possible alternative.
[00:07:49] <lintguy> And the color callibration and graphic drivers suck ass
[00:07:58] <lintguy> But for development, i guess it's ideal
[00:08:05] <grom358> Cork: i think I see the issue.. its using ARIA live regions.. which don't work so well in VoiceOver
[00:11:41] <lintguy> Cork: I guess when they finally move over to Wayland, i will try it again
[00:13:47] <lintguy> Cork: I just had to use parseInt on the variable and voila, it worked :)
[00:13:52] <lintguy> Cork: Thanks for getting me thinking
[00:23:09] <Uhkis> lintguy: what distro are you on if you have to fix stuff all the time?
[00:23:35] <deepy> Ubuntu
[00:24:22] <Uhkis> that distro is unfixable ;-)
[00:24:59] <lintguy> Ubuntu and Kubuntu, yeah…
[00:25:05] <lintguy> I have also noticed that.
[00:25:28] <lintguy> I run Debian as my main for all servers, so i guess I'll be trying that next time as a desktop OS as well.
[00:25:35] <lintguy> Then at least things ARE fixable.
[00:25:43] <lintguy> Uhkis
[00:26:01] <Uhkis> i'd recommend arch
[00:29:59] <lintguy> Uhkis: It seems most people that know linux properly, recommends it. I'll be trying it as well, but I feel safer with stuff i know properly. Do you know if Arch uses systemd?
[00:30:16] <Cork> it does
[00:30:33] <Cork> there is only two "bigger" distros that don't
[00:30:40] <Cork> (or plan to)
[00:30:49] <Uhkis> gentoo, ubuntu and debian
[00:30:50] <Cork> slackware and gentoo
[00:30:52] <Uhkis> i count 3
[00:30:52] <Cork> no
[00:30:59] <Cork> ubuntu and debian is moving to systemd
[00:31:10] <Cork> ubuntu as soon as in 15.04
[00:31:17] <nbros652> Cork, many thanks. Your solution worked beautifully. I trimmed it all down to one function. http://jsfiddle.net/byjvf6xe/2/
[00:31:22] <Uhkis> that's still months away :p
[00:31:27] <lintguy> Yeah, there's even a non-systemd debian fork
[00:31:42] <Uhkis> and debian is even further from systemd
[00:31:55] <Cork> lintguy: fund-racing for a fork
[00:31:56] <lintguy> But they are still heading there…
[00:32:00] <Uhkis> and you can use systemd on gentoo
[00:32:01] <Cork> the fork isn't a defacto yet
[00:32:24] <lintguy> Cork: wasn't there an alpha on github?
[00:32:33] <lintguy> Cork: but yeah, mostly fund-raising
[00:33:04] <Cork> lintguy: to actually get a working debian-like distro going they will have to put in a freaking lot of work
[00:33:18] <Cork> debian is a monster of a release machine
[00:33:43] <Cork> and before they actually manage to get that going i don't consider it a working fork
[00:34:18] <lintguy> Cork: Neither do i, it doesn't even feel plausible
[00:34:50] <lintguy> without the community support as a whole, it will just be another new distro
[00:34:52] <Cork> well it is possible, but it is close to as much work as to fork the links kernel
[00:35:10] <Cork> so i'm doubtful they will actually manage
[00:35:22] <Cork> ...
[00:35:27] <Cork> "the linux kernel"
[00:35:34] <Cork> what kind of a weird typo was that...
[00:35:50] <lintguy> :-D
[00:35:56] <lintguy> I still read the linux kernel
[00:35:58] <lintguy> funny
[00:36:01] <Uhkis> advertising text-only browser on #jquery, omg! :D
[00:36:09] <Cork> lol
[00:36:21] <Cork> and a browser kernel
[00:36:28] <Cork> not even sure what that would be
[00:36:49] <Cork> the html parser maybe?
[00:37:00] <lintguy> i loved the idea of chromeOS but only if it where completely open source and responsibly managed
[00:37:19] <lintguy> There's been some work on NodeOS :)
[00:37:25] <Cork> ya jolla is more interesting for me
[00:37:39] <Cork> firefox os... too low end i thik
[00:37:51] <lintguy> Jolla indeed, but parts of it are closed source :-(
[00:37:58] <Cork> it is?
[00:38:03] <Cork> thought it was completely open
[00:38:17] <lintguy> Noep
[00:38:37] <lintguy> But i think the closed components where not that important
[00:38:56] <lintguy> but still, i don't like the idea of a company running things such as OS's
[00:39:05] <lintguy> they could close parts at any time
[00:39:12] <Cork> lintguy: you have any links to this?
[00:39:24] <Cork> there is no mentioning about sailfish having closed source in it
[00:39:52] <lintguy> Cork: The user interface layer is Jolla-specific and is currently closed
[00:39:57] <Cork> ah
[00:40:10] <lintguy> But it might not remain closed
[00:40:10] <Cork> that throws that out the window then...
[00:40:23] <lintguy> Indeed, kind of important part of the project ;)
[00:40:27] <Cork> ya
[00:41:01] <Cork> i "love" how every freaking vendor wave the "we are open source" flag now days
[00:41:16] <lintguy> Cork: It's just a marketing stunt
[00:41:23] <Cork> and when you sit down a look at it "oh, you mean you use the linux kernel, and everything else is closed source" -_-'
[00:41:25] <lintguy> And to get good developers for no money
[00:41:33] <Cork> ya
[00:41:34] <Uhkis> small print says: we used zlib
[00:41:51] <lintguy> I'm sick and tired of crippleware as i call it.
[00:42:07] <lintguy> It's the worst in the CRM world
[00:42:11] <Cork> or things like android opensource, but if you want to run a program on it you need the propriatary apis
[00:42:25] <Cork> so in reality it is closed
[00:42:36] <lintguy> Exactly, so it's crippled
[00:42:57] <Cork> its not even crippled, it is "you can view the source"
[00:43:05] <Cork> and they are changing open source to mean that
[00:44:11] <lintguy> True
[00:44:47] <Cork> and sadly i think very few understand the difference
[00:45:28] <lintguy> Indeed.
[00:45:40] <lintguy> The worst experience i've had is onlyoffice.
[00:45:54] <lintguy> They charge a license fee for even using the NAME of the product!
[00:46:20] <lintguy> And then punish you with fees if you don't market only their product and you are not allowed to market any competitive product
[00:46:32] <lintguy> luckily i read the terms and conditions :P
[00:46:55] <deepy> Cork: doesn't AOSP show that Android is open-source?
[00:47:10] <deepy> Which is a different Android than the one you see on Google's phone of course
[00:47:15] <deepy> oops, had scrolled up
[00:47:38] <lintguy> deepy: you can surely make android fully open source, that's what cyanogenmod is doing
[00:47:51] <Cork> deepy: 1. the source code is "thrown over the fence" when google "feel like it"
[00:48:02] <Cork> it isn't open for anyone else to participate
[00:48:03] <lintguy> all the google specific stuff have been properly seperated in the latest Android 5.x so now it's even easier
[00:48:28] <Cork> 2. almost every open source application in android has been deprecated
[00:48:41] <Cork> and replaced by a close source google branded application
[00:48:44] <lintguy> But yeah, like Cork says, Google is the sole maintainer and leads the direction of the project completely.
[00:48:46] <Cork> 3. the api is closed
[00:48:50] <deepy> lintguy: http://www.xda-developers.com/android/oneplus-without-cyanogenmod-india/
[00:49:02] <Cork> but sure the java vm and the linux kernel is open source
[00:49:12] <Cork> but... i don't see that as an open source project
[00:49:36] <Cork> oh, and not to forget the drivers for the hardware is close source
[00:49:45] <Cork> so you can't even compile the kernel your self
[00:49:53] <Cork> you need to use there binary blob from the hardware vendors
[00:50:09] <lintguy> There's been some work on open sourced GPU drivers for Android, but the performance is abysmal
[00:50:26] <Cork> for one of the gpus yes
[00:50:34] <Cork> and he has been working like a mad man
[00:50:41] <lintguy> And even if you'd make a handset using android, every handset have a 7$ fee that has to be paid to Microsoft :)
[00:50:53] <Cork> ya
[00:51:07] <Cork> so again, there is extreamly little open about android
[00:51:16] <lintguy> Funny thing is that Microsoft earns more on these fees that they do on windows, office and xbox combined
[00:51:42] <Cork> ya, that is the broken pattenting system for you
[00:51:56] <lintguy> Indeed, software should never have had patents
[00:51:59] <Cork> you don't actually have to do anything, or actually have any costs (except the panent fee)
[00:52:15] <Cork> someone else can do all the work and costs, and then you can just reap the profits
[00:52:24] <lintguy> Sad indeed
[00:52:30] <Cork> you don't even have to tell them before you demand the money :/
[00:52:33] <lintguy> did you guys see the NFC patent trolls? ;)
[00:52:41] <lintguy> 16 large manufacturers in the US just got sued
[00:52:47] <Cork> no, missed that one
[00:52:51] <lintguy> so now everyone else is removing or deactivating NFC
[00:52:55] <Cork> doesn't surprise me though
[00:52:59] <lintguy> I wonder when Apple will get sued ;)
[00:53:07] <lintguy> since their new payment system relies on it
[00:54:02] <lintguy> Oh… I see Apple was granted their own patent specifically for using NFC for payments.
[00:54:12] <lintguy> So that's why it's ONLY used for payments!
[00:54:14] <lintguy> Explains a lot
[00:54:22] <Uhkis> iPay
[00:54:33] <lintguy> iPay with iSoul
[00:54:41] <Uhkis> they didn't have the balls to call it that :D
[00:55:22] <lintguy> This is where i first heard of these patent trolls https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1742002229/portable-wearable-bluetooth-speaker-with-ultra-pre/posts
[01:01:50] <IamTrying> http://jsfiddle.net/wfbY8/4/ - I have this DRAG script but its not perfectly dragging also used jQuery both dragging is not so sharp/smooth/crips, like if you drag this login window from here http://web.airdroid.com/
[01:03:47] <Cork> IamTrying: you need to take into account the cursor position on the element
[01:03:51] <prema> Hi People! Currently using JQuery EasyUI. This seems to run in it's own closure. I want to pop up an image from the grid which is of course generated after load. Any tips?
[01:03:55] <Cork> so you don't snap to the top left
[01:05:02] <Cork> IamTrying: also your not using jquery so => ##javascript
[01:05:50] <Blaster> Say I want to open a modal box when the page is loaded, should I use #modalBoxName in the URL query string or something?
[01:06:01] <Blaster> And then in my jQuery, check for that, and load the modal if it's there?
[01:06:11] <Blaster> I thought I seen something like this before.
[01:06:16] <IamTryin_> Cork: the problem i am having is that when i move my mouse fast, my cursor is in another location and the window is not dragging. But when i use same thing with web.airdroid.com
[01:06:36] <Cork> IamTrying_: => ##javascript
[01:07:14] <Cork> Blaster: that is one option, it depends on what you want/need to do
[01:07:32] <Blaster> Basically I have a modal with a form in it.
[01:07:33] <IamTrying_> Cork: with JQuery i have same http://jqueryui.com/draggable/  compare to web.airdroid.com
[01:07:47] <Blaster> And if they submit the form and the validation fails, I need to reopen that modal box with the form errors.
[01:08:03] <Blaster> But I want to do a hard reload for the submit, not submit over AJAX, because the framework I work in makes it a bit difficult to do that.
[01:08:12] <Cork> Blaster: simplest is prob to do that with ajax
[01:08:13] <Blaster> Server side framework that is.
[01:08:23] <Cork> then you don't need to fiddle with the url to open the dialog
[01:08:37] <Blaster> I'm interested in learning how to handle that anyway.
[01:08:46] <Blaster> Because I have had lots of scenarios where I needed to do that.
[01:08:56] <Blaster> Plus for SEO purposes it's important too.
[01:09:08] <Cork> Blaster: then i would prob set a value in the html instead of in the url
[01:09:19] <Blaster> I want it to be permalinkable.
[01:09:37] <Cork> you want a validation error to be permalinkable??
[01:09:46] <Blaster> No, for something else.
[01:09:53] <Blaster> Say I put my customer support info in a modal box.
[01:10:24] <Cork> well then ya you can use #<value>
[01:10:31] <Cork> or ?dialog=name
[01:10:39] <Cork> depending if you want it to survive redirects or not
[01:10:44] <Blaster> And then I just search for that using Javascript to access the URL parts?
[01:10:54] <Cork> (the first one won't ever be submitted by the browser so the server won't ever see it)
[01:11:02] <Cork> window.location.hash
[01:11:06] <Cork> or window.location.search
[01:11:21] <Blaster> What do you mean by the first one won't be submitted by the browser?
[01:11:36] <Cork> has tags isn't part of the url when the browser submits the url
[01:11:41] <Cork> it is completely client side
[01:11:51] <Blaster> Oh, when a form is submitted?
[01:12:11] <Cork> if you submit a form with the hash in it it will be removed before sending the url to the server
[01:12:20] <Cork> the server can then redirects to an url with the hash
[01:12:20] <Blaster> Hmm, I see.
[01:12:27] <Cork> but it won't survive a server trip
[01:12:47] <Blaster> Yea they will submit to the URL without the hash.
[01:12:56] <Cork> exactly
[01:12:57] <Blaster> And if there's errors, it will redirect them to the URL with the hash to open the form back up.
[01:13:04] <Blaster> But then if they submit again...
[01:13:17] <Blaster> The hash would be lost, right?
[01:13:29] <Cork> something you would normally want for validation yes
[01:13:46] <Cork> and is why i said you shouldn't put validation results in the ulr
[01:13:49] <Cork> *url
[01:13:57] <Blaster> I think maybe I can just make actual routes in my app, and use them to open modals directly.
[01:14:44] <Blaster> That's precisely what I'm going to try.
[01:15:03] <Blaster> But that's out of the scope of jQuery. I'm using Symfony and PHP for my server side framework.
[01:28:42] <tomasm-> can anyone explain why this function returns the list in numerical order despite that the values are not set in that order? Also, isn't using a hash {...} instead of array [....] meaning it preserves keys?
[01:28:49] <tomasm-> http://jsfiddle.net/13ff4mwh/
[01:41:41] <_rgn> tomasm-: object key value order is not guaranteed
[01:42:12] <tomasm-> _rgn, yeah i see that now. so I've stored it into hashes-in-arrays instead
[01:52:09] <root3d> how does this callback works ? https://gist.github.com/igauravsehrawat/63d96035fbdbad132fab
[01:52:24] <root3d> the last getjson get is fetched first?
[01:53:14] <Cork> O_o'
[01:53:24] <Cork> root3d: that code is racy like... wow
[01:54:05] <root3d> Cork, what do you mean exactly ?
[01:54:16] <Cork> ah wait sorry
[01:54:20] <Cork> they use different names
[01:54:37] <root3d> did you mean race condition
[01:54:38] <Cork> root3d: it sets the values async as the getJSON calls resolve
[01:54:51] <Cork> i missed company_updates
[01:55:02] <Cork> read it as company_events in both places
[01:55:17] <Cork> but it is still racy
[01:55:30] <root3d> Cork, any disadvantage ?
[01:55:31] <Cork> but not as bad as i first thought it was
[01:55:57] <Cork> root3d: if company_updates takes more time to get the response back to the browser the info will be lost
[01:56:32] <Cork> meaning if events.json process and transfers back to the browser faster then company_updates you won't get company_updates
[01:57:09] <root3d> Cork, that's the catch , but what if both json are on same server ?
[01:57:16] <Cork> doesn't matter
[01:57:39] <Cork> root3d: unless the server is single threaded and only process one request (at all) at the time
[01:57:47] <Cork> then you would be safe
[01:58:24] <Cork> s/at the time/at a time/
[01:58:31] <root3d> Cork, which server would be that , seems like j2ee kind of
[01:58:48] <Cork> root3d: hopefully none for the last 20 years
[01:58:55] <Cork> as it would be quite slow and inefficient
[01:59:02] <root3d> Cork, i get it, my poor design & implementation
[01:59:09] <Cork> root3d: what i try to say is you shouldn't do it like this
[01:59:14] <Cork> yes
[01:59:26] <Cork> $.when() is built for exactly this kind of situations
[01:59:59] <Cork> $($.getJSON(), $.getJSON()).done(function() { preform(CompanyProfileData); });
[02:00:17] <Cork> opps wrong
[02:00:21] <Cork> $.when($.getJSON(), $.getJSON()).done(function() { preform(CompanyProfileData); });
[02:01:20] <root3d> Cork, i need to get back to school again.
[02:01:55] <root3d> old school
[02:02:10] <root3d> Cork, thanks
[02:02:14] <Cork> yw
[02:10:04] <titii> Should works in a not() function also the jquery object $(this) ? like not( $(this) ) or not( $('.selector') ) ?
[02:15:39] <Cork> titii: yes, though you don't need $() for this
[02:15:43] <Cork> just .not(this)
[02:16:00] <Cork> and actually .not('.selector')
[02:16:37] <titii> Cork: oh, ty it works
[02:16:42] <titii> ty
[02:19:35] <titii> Hmmm the next question, I have a padding right on the element which has an onclick event. The click on padding doesnt works? Why?
[02:20:03] <titii> Can i do that<
[02:22:11] <Cork> titii: click on padding should work just fine
[03:00:31] <titii> How can I resolve to click on the object, when its parent has an absolute positioned presudo element after lay over my space to click?
[03:13:22] <Cork> titii: should still work fine
[03:14:59] <titii> Cork: no it not, because the parent pseudo absolute element lay over that space of my object, so i was solve it by replacing pseudo after from parent to my object
[03:15:03] <titii> ty man for asssit
[03:15:54] <Cork> ah, parent pseudo
[03:15:58] <Cork> missed that parent part :)
[03:16:16] <Cork> titii: you could use pointer-event
[03:16:24] <Cork> but it isn't cross browser (none ie support) yet
[03:17:28] <titii> Cork: yes that i wanted to heard about :) so no version of Msie support that?
[03:18:06] <Cork> titii: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events#Browser_compatibility
[03:18:19] <Cork> if your ok with only supporting ie11 :)
[03:18:21] <Cork> the sure
[03:18:29] <Cork> *then
[03:18:56] <titii> Cork: uhm, thats bad, really bad
[03:19:28] <Cork> suspected as much
[03:28:32] <Code2Consumer> Hello !!!
[03:28:58] <Code2Consumer> I need some help please guys ! :$
[03:29:07] <Cork> ?ask @ Code2Consumer
[03:29:07] <b-ot> Code2Consumer: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:30:37] <Code2Consumer> ok haha ! So ... Im trying to call functions on div with ids that i created with append()
[03:30:54] <Code2Consumer> but it doesnt seems to work
[03:31:38] <Code2Consumer> (by the way im sorry my english is realy bad) so i wanned to know if their is a way to create html if we want to call functions in it
[03:36:06] <Cork> Code2Consumer: you most likely try to bind on an element that doesn't exist at the time of the code run
[03:36:15] <Cork> Code2Consumer: you want to delegate the event handler to a parent instead
[03:38:29] <Code2Consumer> I already thinked about this but its not possible in the way that my project work :x
[03:38:44] <Cork> Code2Consumer: why not?
[03:39:35] <Code2Consumer> Its complicated and my english is bad but im using ajax and XML to create an "explorer" so you have some folders when you click in it you can see what is in this folder
[03:40:00] <Code2Consumer> so i go on xml to see what is in the folder and i happend() what is in it
[03:40:15] <Cork> Code2Consumer: ok i think i know where the problem is
[03:40:32] <Cork> you shouldn't control how the interface work by adding and removing event listeners
[03:40:44] <Cork> you should do that by "flagging" the different elements
[03:40:51] <Cork> and have the event handlers just react to that
[03:40:54] <shebbi> !seen coldhead
[03:40:54] <b-ot> shebbi: I saw coldhead 12h 5m ago, quitting with the message: Quit: Ullhodturdenweirmudgaardgringnirurdrmolnirfenrirlukkilokkibaugimandodrrerinsurtkrinmgernrackinarockar
[03:40:59] <Cork> else you end up with a code hell
[03:41:35] <Code2Consumer> what do you mean by flagging ? like add class and id ?
[03:44:50] <Code2Consumer> Actualy im not adding and removing event listener im just adding nods , html and <div> </div>
[03:49:19] <Cork> Code2Consumer: by adding a class or a data-<something>
[03:49:38] <Cork> Code2Consumer: flagging by id is normally a bad solution as they always have to be unique
[03:52:40] <shebbi> Cork: How are you mate?
[04:20:52] <Code2Consumer> Cork: I find a solution thank for your help ! :)
[04:20:56] <mrbubbles> hey! $.ajax is ignoring my headers: :(
[04:21:12] <Cork> mrbubbles: what datatype?
[04:21:16] <mrbubbles> I tried adding both “headers: xx” and being beforesend
[04:21:18] <mrbubbles> json
[04:21:22] <Cork> json or jsonp?
[04:21:25] <mrbubbles> just json
[04:21:27] <Cork> ok
[04:21:51] <mrbubbles> Cork: that should be okay aye?
[04:22:01] <mrbubbles> I’m just inspecting the request in chrome and it just doesn’t seem to have them included
[04:22:07] <mrbubbles> works fine if I add them URl params
[04:22:33] <Cork> mrbubbles: is it post or get?
[04:22:40] <Cork> also is it cross domain?
[04:22:59] <mrbubbles> get
[04:23:14] <Cork> and the last question?
[04:23:42] <mrbubbles> yes it’s cross domain, i’ve set access headers in rails to allow it. it works fine if I don’t set the headers and use url params instead
[04:23:58] <mrbubbles> ALSO (and this is the weird one) I’ve just tried using Postman with the same headers and it works
[04:24:12] <Cork> one question left then :)
[04:24:14] <hanmac1> hey i want to add some kind of animation for an element, that a class is added, but then removed again later (only as highlight/notifiy for the user) hm what would be the niced way to do that?
[04:24:22] <Cork> have you tried the headers: {} option?
[04:24:55] <Cork> as in $.ajax(url, { headers: { 'some-header-here': 'value' } })
[04:29:15] <mrbubbles> Yep I’ve tried that. I’m just comparing the two requests to see what the difference is. As far as I can see adding the headers causes the following two changes: Access-Control-Request-Headers:accept, x-user-token, x-user-email  Access-Control-Request-Method:GET
[04:29:52] <Cork> AH
[04:29:58] <Cork> http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#preflight-request
[04:30:11] <Cork> Note: Cross-origin requests using a method that is simple with author request headers that are not simple will have a preflight request to ensure that the resource can handle those headers. (Similarly to requests using a method that is not a simple method.)
[04:30:25] <Cork> "A header is said to be a simple header if the header field name is an ASCII case-insensitive match for Accept, Accept-Language, or Content-Language or if it is an ASCII case-insensitive match for Content-Type"
[04:30:42] <Cork> mrbubbles: so you will have to handle the option call resulting from setting custom headers in the get call
[04:30:52] <Cork> by spec
[04:30:56] <mrbubbles> errr
[04:31:32] <Cork> mrbubbles: you follow the problem?
[04:31:43] <mrbubbles> Oh yes I think so
[04:32:10] <mrbubbles> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8685678/cors-how-do-preflight-an-httprequest is that the one?
[04:32:45] <Cork> mrbubbles: no the browser does the preflight on it's own you don't need to do anything client side
[04:32:58] <mrbubbles> okay I’m not sure I follow then
[04:33:04] <Cork> mrbubbles: you need to configure the server to respond to the HTTP OPTIONS call though
[04:33:24] <Cork> and there you will have the headers you plan to send to the get call included
[04:33:34] <Cork> and you need to return a 2xx response for that
[04:33:42] <Cork> so the browser knows it is allowed to do the call
[04:33:53] <Cork> (this will be cached in the browser so only happen the first time)
[04:34:25] <mrbubbles> okay one sec, gonna do a bit of googling
[04:34:29] <mrbubbles> THanks Cork :)
[04:34:32] <Cork> np
[04:35:06] <mrbubbles> don’t suppose you know how to set this up in rails do you? ;)
[04:35:09] <Cork> mrbubbles: that said, the simplest solution might be to just use a params string
[04:35:17] <mrbubbles> yeh I’m leaning towards that tbh
[04:35:19] <Cork> never needed to
[04:35:26] <Cork> as ie has very poor support
[04:35:27] <mrbubbles> just annoys me not knowing it
[04:35:32] <Cork> we proxy it in nginx instead
[04:35:44] <skullcrasher> can anybody tell me, how I can find the origin of a submit event?
[04:35:51] <mrbubbles> okay I guess URL parameters will be safer
[04:35:54] <mrbubbles> I’ll stick with that
[04:35:56] <mrbubbles> Cheers
[04:35:58] <Cork> skullcrasher: the origin is event.target
[04:36:09] <skullcrasher> I have a form that seems to get submitted 4 times, although I only 1 submit event handlyer
[04:36:10] <Cork> skullcrasher: but if you mean what button was clicked, then no you can't
[04:36:20] <Cork> ah
[04:36:29] <mrbubbles> Cork: just one question though, how come Postman is able to do it without any issues/
[04:36:50] <Cork> skullcrasher: most developer tools lets you see what event handlers is bound to an element
[04:37:05] <Cork> skullcrasher: check there so you don't have it bound multiple times
[04:37:42] <Cork> mrbubbles: might be it runs like trusted code (it is an extension after all)
[04:37:50] <mrbubbles> ah good point
[04:37:52] <Cork> and then isn't restricted by same order
[04:37:55] <Cork> *origin
[04:38:24] <skullcrasher> Cork, if I look in chrome developer tools at the form element, and there event listeners, there is only 1 entry in submit
[04:39:03] <Cork> skullcrasher: and you aren't doing a .submit() or something like that in the event handler?
[04:39:03] <winegoddess> I'm looking at a plugin, and the first line is !function (factory) {    - what does the ! symbol do? I think i have seen other symbols such as ~ as well.
[04:39:25] <Cork> winegoddess: it is just there to help the parser
[04:39:38] <Cork> it is similar to (function(){})()
[04:39:44] <winegoddess> hi Cork - can you explain? I understand why to use a ; but not ! or ~
[04:39:46] <Cork> =>  !function(){}()
[04:39:55] <skullcrasher> Cork, no. it only appends an input to the form
[04:39:59] <Cork> winegoddess: if you do function() {}() the parser will puke
[04:40:16] <Cork> skullcrasher: can you reproduce the problem in jsfiddle?
[04:40:18] <skullcrasher> and if an ajax option is set, it sends the form as ajax request
[04:40:23] <skullcrasher> yes, I will try
[04:40:26] <winegoddess> but what is different than using ( function() {}()
[04:40:43] <Cork> winegoddess: and (function(){}) is to help the parser take the content as a function
[04:40:53] <Cork> and then you do () to have it execute
[04:41:03] <Cork> as (function(){})()
[04:41:04] <winegoddess> ok  but what is ! or ~ ?
[04:41:10] <Cork> its the same thing
[04:41:25] <Cork> except it modifies the result from the function
[04:41:56] <Cork> (function(){})() or (function(){}()) or !function(){}() or ~function(){}()
[04:42:05] <Cork> all results in a self executing anonymous function
[04:42:43] <winegoddess> I have read on IIFE but i really would like to know how ~ or ! differs -  or why to use which
[04:43:11] <Cork> winegoddess: ! is inversion !true === false
[04:43:21] <Cork> it has exactly that meaning here too
[04:43:37] <Cork> ~ is bitwise not
[04:43:46] <Cork> and does exactly that here
[04:43:59] <Cork> winegoddess: but the effect on the return value isn't of interest here
[04:44:09] <Cork> as it is only used to help the parser
[04:44:24] <winegoddess> so it is just thrown in just because - and it doesn't matter if you use ! or ~ or ( ?
[04:44:32] <Cork> personally i prefer to wrap it in () as it doesn't modify the return value
[04:44:44] <Cork> winegoddess: only ( won't parse
[04:44:51] <Cork> you have to wrap the function if you use ()
[04:45:17] <Cork> the other is just another way to get the parser to understand that it should create a function and then execute it
[04:45:43] <Cork> similar to var a = (function() { return 1; })(); a === 1
[04:45:58] <winegoddess> Cork i appreciate you taking the time to answer, and sorry if Im not 100% there yet...
[04:45:59] <Cork> similar to var a = !function() { return 1; }(); a === false
[04:46:03] <winegoddess> i understand we need to wrap IIFE
[04:46:07] <Cork> var a = ~function() { return 1; }(); a === -1
[04:46:10] <winegoddess> i just don't get why ! or ~ is used
[04:46:17] <Cork> uh
[04:46:21] <Cork> i've answered it three times
[04:46:35] <Cork> "to help the parser understand it should execute the function"
[04:46:41] <winegoddess> Im looking at a plugin that doesn't have a return - it just is using the !
[04:46:46] <Cork> it has absolutely no other reason for existance there
[04:46:51] <winegoddess> why choose that over (   - style?
[04:47:04] <Cork> cause they don't like the extra ) chacater?
[04:49:36] <Cork> i personally really dislike ! and ~here
[04:49:36] <Cork> as if you want to capture the output of the function it will be distorted
[04:49:36] <winegoddess> :) ok. i appreciate the answer.
[04:49:36] <Cork> but all of the solutions ! ~ () is basically just hacks, un needed code to hint to the browser
[04:49:36] <Erwat> hey Cork i have a css-type question: if i want to set the position of an element to be in the middle i could use 50% on left, but is it possible to make it be 50% but only hte nearest integer?
[04:49:36] <Cork> it isn't there for code effect reasons
[04:49:36] <Cork> Erwat: heh, fun question
[04:49:36] <Cork> Erwat: i'm quite sure it should be snapped to even pixels by default
[04:49:36] <Cork> if you by integer mean percent, then no
[04:49:45] <Cork> you might be able to do something nifty with calc()
[04:49:50] <Cork> but never tried
[04:49:58] <vx> hi, i need to not do a do_shortcode() in the template if has_shortcode( $post->post_content , but i have a multipage post, and i have the shortcode in a particular page, so  $post->post_content isnt working coz now the do_shortcode() isnt working for the entire post, how can i just capture that page ?
[04:50:06] <Cork> (also i would recommend asking that in #css)
[04:50:25] <Cork> vx: wrong channel
[04:50:48] <vx> ty
[04:51:30] <Erwat> Cork: ty
[04:51:51] <Erwat> i meant snapped to even pixels, but that's what i thought; i suspected that the bug could bet his but yeah i figured it might be snapped to the pixels themselves
[04:52:55] <Cork> Erwat: might also be snapped to css pixels
[04:53:04] <Cork> Erwat: not completely sure there
[04:55:11] <Erwat> but the problem i'm having is that when i slide in an element from off the screen (gets added and slid in) then some of the objects move a little
[04:55:39] <Erwat> but only in chrome and only when the game is downscaled a little (we have our own scaling stuff)
[04:55:44] <Erwat> but it ONLY happens in chrome
[04:55:45] <Cork> Erwat: is any of them text/inline elements?
[04:56:03] <Erwat> they should all be absolute, but there is text on some of the stuff that are slid in
[04:56:16] <Erwat> oh inline, eh i don't know what that is
[04:56:20] <Cork> that is position, not what type they are
[04:57:04] <Cork> Erwat: reason i ask is text is snapped to a column/row structure in a solution i don't really follow
[04:57:08] <Erwat> well it's just a menu so a few buttons (images that change) and some text
[04:57:19] <Cork> and it has caused me grate headaches
[04:57:24] <Cork> and this might be the same problem
[04:57:32] <Erwat> hmm, i'm not sure. i'll check it out. thank you for the heads up
[04:57:40] <Cork> (has a round circle with a question mark that should be in the middle)
[04:57:58] <Cork> and when the element move the question mark kept bouncing around in the bubble
[04:58:11] <Erwat> yeah something like that is happening
[04:58:22] <Cork> sounds like the text aligning then
[04:58:28] <Erwat> also funny how the element is called <div class="row"> (but this is just coincidence)
[04:59:29] <Erwat> but yeah text size does seem to also change
[05:01:00] <Erwat> it looks funny i have "25.00" written and when this happens the "2" and "5" become closer to one another
[05:01:41] <Cork> give me a minute to recrate my old example
[05:02:01] <Erwat> oh you don't have to, i don't think it'll be worth it
[05:02:15] <Erwat> i can't really show you much about the code i'm doing but i just didn't have any ideas
[05:03:42] <Cork> Erwat: http://jsfiddle.net/7ts0xbfz/
[05:03:52] <Cork> it is much worse in firefox then chrome though
[05:04:23] <Erwat> i don't understand
[05:04:41] <Erwat> it's not doing anything for me, when i use run it just blinks
[05:04:51] <Cork> blinks??
[05:05:08] <Cork> the bubble should move from top left to about mid bottom
[05:05:20] <Erwat> stays top left for me
[05:05:43] <Erwat> okay works in firefox
[05:05:44] <Cork> might be on an old chrome that doesn't support @keyframes then
[05:05:49] <Erwat> and yeah that's what it looks like essentially
[05:06:06] <Erwat> Version 39.0.2171.71 m
[05:06:24] <Cork> Erwat: if that is what you see there isn't much you can do about it as far as i've noticed
[05:06:40] <Cork> except possibly render the text in a canvas and use that
[05:06:54] <Erwat> well it LOOKS like that but i think the problem is different
[05:07:02] <Erwat> it's not about the animating stuff jumping around
[05:07:12] <Erwat> like half the screen jumps a little
[05:07:17] <Cork> ah
[05:07:22] <Cork> no then it's something else
[05:07:33] <Erwat> someonet hought that maybe elements that have a position like 48.5 or similar fraction are the ones that move
[05:07:55] <Cork> ya, that is the snapping that it does
[05:08:11] <Cork> if two elements don't have the exact same fraction you can get that element "jiggle"
[05:08:47] <Cork> when one is rounded to ex. 48 (from 47.6) and the other gets rounded to 47 (from 47.4)
[05:15:46] <Erwat> Cork: yep, looks that way, this logic is kinda beyond me at times
[05:16:00] <Erwat> someone very much more experienced than me has made a lot of the structure and i don't always get it
[05:19:34] <Erwat> yep, i'm convinced it's that: i have an element that is exactly 1 pixel to the right as it should be
[05:19:43] <Erwat> of where it should be*
[05:29:35] <hanmac1> hm i tryed something like ".addClass(hclass).delay(8000).removeClass(hclass);" but it doesnt seems to work as i wanted ... exist there an easier way or what do i need to do?
[05:29:57] <Cork> hanmac1: .delay() only affects animations
[05:30:13] <Cork> you need to use setTimeout or .queue() .unqueue()
[05:30:34] <hanmac1> hm as i thought ... and it seems i cant animate it like that (or what would you do?)
[05:30:58] <Cork> you can animate classes if you have jquery ui included
[05:31:10] <Cork> it extends *Class to do animations of the new properties
[05:33:10] <hydalgo> hello, I can't get .pagecontainer({load: function(){console.log("hi!");}}) fired when changing pages in jquery-mobile-bower 1.4.2 my code is here https://github.com/cesarpachon/cuentacuentos/blob/master/www/js/index.js what would be wrong?
[05:34:52] <hanmac1> Cork: hm yeah i did see that, hm then i need to test what would be the best so it does shows it and then hide it again ... i think the complete might do it
[05:35:49] <Cork> hanmac1: $().addClass('class'); setTimeout(function() { $().removeClass('class'); }, 8000);
[05:35:53] <Cork> is most likely the simplest

[06:16:05] <notchris> Hey all
[06:16:24] <notchris> I broke something. How do I add the string / data ID correctly?
[06:16:24] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyy
[06:16:25] <notchris> var post_url = "/dev/exhibits/" . $(this).data("id");
[06:16:30] <notchris> Haha! hey @BillCriswell
[06:16:35] <BillCriswell> notchris: + instead of .
[06:16:41] <notchris> @BillCriswell Ahh, is
[06:16:44] <notchris> . for php ?
[06:16:51] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[06:16:54] <BillCriswell> + for Javscript
[06:17:30] <notchris> Weird @BillCriswell
[06:17:33] <notchris> var post_url = "/dev/exhibits/" + $(this).data("id"); doesn’t work
[06:17:46] <notchris> But putting the data ID as “/dev/exhibits/value” works
[06:17:56] <BillCriswell> What is value?
[06:18:19] <notchris> http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/exhibits
[06:18:29] <notchris> The first post “value” = grossology
[06:18:37] <notchris> but I just want that as at the Data ID
[06:18:54] <notchris> and then add the previous part of the url in the script as I tried above
[06:19:04] <BillCriswell> Are you sure this is what you think it is?
[06:19:29] <notchris> @BillCriswell Haha I’m never sure! But I’ll keep trying right now to confirm
[06:20:28] <BillCriswell> notchris: http://jsbin.com/cigogiwebi/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:21:10] <notchris> @BillCriswell Ahh, I just confirm that it is working
[06:21:19] <notchris> But for some reason the post is displaying all post titles
[06:21:21] <notchris> So it’s a loop issue
[06:21:25] * notchris is silly
[06:23:25] <BillCriswell> Haha sounds fun.
[06:44:48] <reynierpm> hi there and moorning I have a set of hidden inputs with this syntax <input type="hidden" name="tipoRecaudos[]" id="tipoRecaudo3" /> the only thing that differs is the id of course, how do I get theirs Id and push to and array? Take into account that I have more hidden fields so I only needs those contained on tipoRecaudos[]
[06:46:02] <BillCriswell> var ids = $('input[name^=tipoRecaudos]').map(function () { return this.id }).get();
[06:46:35] <reynierpm> BillCriswell so in ids I will have a array like {id1, id2, idn} right?
[06:46:52] <BillCriswell> [id1, id2, etc], but yes
[06:47:04] <reynierpm> good thanks
[06:47:08] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[06:50:05] <reynierpm> BillCriswell if I want the value rarer than id then should change return this.id for return this.value, right?
[06:50:15] <microhaxo> Guys, i want to know if its possible to search for a string in html elements, the only problem is each character is contained within its own div: example http://jsfiddle.net/g0pud0xw/
[06:51:06] <microhaxo> they could be contained in spans too, just that they are separated per character.
[06:55:38] <microhaxo> Anyone?
[06:56:00] <Cork> microhaxo: no you can't really do that
[06:56:09] <microhaxo> damn
[06:56:11] <Cork> you can serialize the text content in the dom structure and search the string
[06:56:27] <microhaxo> Yea but how can i then highlight that in the markup?
[06:56:29] <Cork> but that isn't preferment if you plan to do it a lot
[06:56:36] <Cork> that is even harder
[06:56:55] <Cork> microhaxo: though that said
[06:57:04] <Cork> you might be able to use the text selection to do that?
[06:57:11] <microhaxo> right, thats the ultimate. I was using jquery highlight which works great, but when faced with the problem of strings being broken up due to api formatting of this extension being used.
[06:57:18] <Cork> unless you need something more flexible then that
[07:03:31] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: Yurp.
[07:08:22] <notchris> @BillCriswell So I’m trying this http://pastebin.com/FXfdZsjd
[07:08:45] <notchris> @BillCriswell So I can change the page based on the get variable, but the script isn’t working as expected
[07:09:18] <joeyDB> hey notchris, BillCriswell
[07:09:24] <notchris> hey @joeyDB :)
[07:11:07] <DaniG2k> i'm trying to make a simple autocomplete work as per this example: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#multiple
[07:11:18] <DaniG2k> I'm trying to integrate it with my Rails 4 app
[07:11:31] <DaniG2k> so far I am able to get a dropdown to display with all the suggested terms
[07:11:59] <notchris> Oops figured it out
[07:12:00] <DaniG2k> however, I am unable to pop off the list of terms and i am unable to append with a comma separated list (', ')
[07:12:04] <notchris> wow I’m such a nub sometimes lol
[07:12:05] <DaniG2k> here's my code: https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/af2ab205bc801cca3e22
[07:12:29] <DaniG2k> any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[07:12:39] <DaniG2k> the input element id is #article_person_list
[07:12:46] <DaniG2k> or, input#article_person_list
[07:12:50] <DaniG2k> either works
[07:13:10] <DaniG2k> but again, I can't pop off the list and I can't make comma separated entries
[07:13:14] <DaniG2k> it overwrites each time
[07:13:52] <mbrzuzy> gawd, coffeescript
[07:13:59] <DaniG2k> mbrzuzy: its not that bad :D
[07:14:37] <mbrzuzy> DaniG2k, to each their own, just never really been a fan of it.  Seems unorganized to me :)
[07:16:25] <notchris> Can I remove a get variable from my URL via jquery?
[07:16:34] <notchris> ?id=example
[07:18:51] <mooncup> http://www.jquerybyexample.net/2012/06/get-url-parameters-using-jquery.html
[07:25:25] <reynierpm> hi again, I am trying to understand how to upload files using Ajax and for that I am reading this http://abandon.ie/notebook/simple-file-uploads-using-jquery-ajax but why the author sends two Ajax request to the same URL? what is the purpose? Is not logic to me or I do not understand so well what he is doing there and I need to adapt this to my situation where I will upload multiple files, can any give me some tips to understand this?
[07:28:52] <Duvdevan> hi
[07:31:07] <decx> reynierpm use a well tested script instead of something you could write yourself in a few hours
[07:31:27] <decx> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/
[07:31:59] <Duvdevan> how to get a width of an element + width of the texts it contains?
[07:32:09] <reynierpm> decx well I goes through write my own logic since I can not get that one, for example, to work since I have some Ajax calls and is not working
[07:32:25] <BillCriswell> Duvdevan: You mean like... how many characters long?
[07:32:34] <decx> blue imps uploader and its php endpoint are well documented
[07:32:54] <reynierpm> decx I am using on top of OneupUploaderBundle from Symfony2 and I have spent 4 days trying get it to work and cant and I leave a issue on their Github not answer so far
[07:33:28] <Code2Consumer> Hello i wanned to know if thats possible to to get the HTML of an element and even the balise. exemple: <div id="exemple"> some texte </div> . I would like to manipulate <div id="exemple"> some texte </div>
[07:33:29] <decx> i'm just saying that handling uploads is always going to come with headaches
[07:33:32] <reynierpm> decx thanks for the tip but I pass at this point I tried several plugins and bundles and none works for me so I need to move on since time goes on
[07:33:49] <reynierpm> decx yes, tell to me, I have a headache for days now
[07:33:54] <decx> i got blue imps uploader going swiftly
[07:34:01] <Duvdevan> I'm using Bootstrap 3.3.1... I'm listing a lots of a.btn.btn-default items with .btn-group as a parent container, and each button/anchor contains different text within itself... thus, the .btn-group justifies those buttons in a horizontal line and it merges buttons when there are alot of them, and the text isn't fully visible as it should be
[07:34:09] <Duvdevan> BillCriswell I hope I explained well
[07:34:29] <reynierpm> decx could be but since I am not using plain PHP instead Symfony2 framework then there is the problem
[07:35:07] <decx> isnt symfony php?
[07:36:11] <Duvdevan> BillCriswell hope you understood my problem
[07:36:46] <reynierpm> decx yes but not plain, it uses POO and the example from BlueImp is just plain PHP without any POO just a few lines of PHP
[07:37:48] <decx> heh poo
[07:39:29] <reynierpm> decx hahaha sorry I speak spanish so POO (Programacion Orientada a Objetos) means OOP (Oriented Object Programming)
[07:40:50] <NoiseEee> Duvdevan: that sounds like a css/bootstrap issue, no?
[07:41:05] <Duvdevan> NoiseEee, maybe yea
[07:41:48] <Duvdevan> but I don't think it's an issue with bootstrap
[07:41:52] <Duvdevan> it works as it should
[07:42:03] <Duvdevan> only screws itself up when alots of elements appear
[07:42:15] <Duvdevan> so it's "mine" issue
[07:42:53] <NoiseEee> well maybe recreate it on jsfiddle
[07:45:23] <Duvdevan> let me try
[07:48:10] <notchris> Can appended html be referenced for use in a script after it is loaded?
[07:48:57] <Duvdevan> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/b3575y40/1/
[07:49:01] <Duvdevan> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/b3575y40/1/
[07:49:22] <Cork> notchris: sure, but you normally just do var parsed = $(html) and do it before you append it
[07:49:36] <Cork> (and then just append parsed when your done)
[07:50:02] <Cork> notchris: that way you reduce the reflows in the page so it goes faster
[07:50:45] <DaniG2k> hmm I've gotten autocomplete to work finally. But I think it's making a request to my json file each time
[07:51:01] <DaniG2k> is there a way to make only one request and store it so that it doesn't keep making new requests?
[07:51:06] <DaniG2k> here's my code:
[07:51:21] <Duvdevan> DaniG2k which autocomplete solution are you using?
[07:51:28] <hlvwrk> ._.
[07:51:30] <DaniG2k> Duvdevan:
[07:51:30] <DaniG2k> https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/f9656a704b45215baf04
[07:51:52] <Cork> DaniG2k: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache
[07:52:03] <Duvdevan> Cork is right
[07:52:11] <DaniG2k> ok let me have a look
[07:52:12] <DaniG2k> thanks
[07:52:15] <Duvdevan> cache results either in browser cache or in a javascript object
[07:52:56] <Cork> always have a look in the demos for jquery ui
[07:53:04] <Cork> they have a ton of info and tips in them ;)
[07:53:11] <DaniG2k> Ive never really done jquery stuff
[07:53:15] <DaniG2k> its a little annoying -_-
[07:53:39] <Cork> DaniG2k: jquery is one of the least annoying frameworks on the market
[07:53:47] <Duvdevan> DaniG2k: $.is(':lifestyle');
[07:53:52] <Cork> the worst; hands down for me is extjs
[07:54:10] <Cork> made me so freaking frustrated i almost ripped my hair out
[07:54:38] <Duvdevan> Cork: yes, very anoying... but I belive that ExtJS nowadays works together with jQuery
[07:54:43] <Duvdevan> correct me if I'm not right
[07:55:13] <Cork> no, extjs does't use jquery
[07:55:39] <Cork> and my biggest problem with extjs was that it was so extreamly hevily influenced by java
[07:56:05] <Cork> and you had to write a ton of code to do the smallest changes if you ever wanted to stick a toe outside that they thought you should do
[07:56:18] <Cork> "i want this grid line to be red"
[07:56:32] <Cork> oh, then you need to create two classes and override this 15 methods...
[07:56:35] <Cork> >_<'
[07:58:27] <Duvdevan> haha
[07:58:33] <Duvdevan> crazy stuff
[07:58:45] <Duvdevan> as we agreed, jQuery is english of javascript frameworks
[07:58:50] <Cork> i exaggerate of course
[07:59:18] <Cork> what happend was i had a column with a floating number
[07:59:30] <Cork> and wanted to color the line based on the value of this column
[07:59:53] <Cork> and noooo, extjs really don't like if you want to do something like cross the meaning of the row and the cell
[08:00:19] <Cork> so i basically had to create a new grid class and inherit the entire grid
[08:00:36] <Duvdevan> hehe crazy
[08:00:38] <Cork> and the in the new grid class replace the row class and from there look at the cell
[08:00:47] <Duvdevan> I never liked it
[08:00:52] <Cork> i couldn't believe my eyes when i saw it...
[08:01:29] <Duvdevan> what about angularjs?
[08:01:46] <hlvwrk> Uh. jQuery UI slider questions. http://jsfiddle.net/xeeL1z2y/5 -- first, how do you make the slider handle animate on click (only animates on click/hold)
[08:01:54] <Cork> in jquery is is something like $().grid({ onNewRow: function(row) { row.cells[1].text() == (something) $(this).addClass() }) }
[08:01:57] <Cork> much easier
[08:02:07] <hlvwrk> second, how do you prevent the handle from being able to be dragged outside of the sliderbar?
[08:02:12] <hlvwrk> Hiya Cork.
[08:02:15] <hlvwrk> How goes your wednesday?
[08:02:31] <Cork> trying to wressel a related database model to do what i want it to do
[08:02:34] <i8ramin> hi folks. according to the docs, the $.extend function ignores values that are undefined or null ... however, according to my tests, it looks like null values are being copied over. I have a simple test here: http://jsfiddle.net/12kwnk4k/2/
[08:02:38] <Cork> been at it almost the entire day >_<
[08:02:40] <i8ramin> am I doing something wrong?
[08:02:52] <hlvwrk> i8ramin if you're getting those errors, probably ;)
[08:03:03] <hlvwrk> Cork hopefully you win.
[08:03:06] <hlvwrk> wrasslin'!
[08:03:15] <i8ramin> hlvwrk: which errors?
[08:03:23] <Cork> hlvwrk: you want to hook the slide handler
[08:03:37] <Cork> hlvwrk: then you just set the value when you don't want to allow it to go further
[08:04:41] <hlvwrk> Ah
[08:04:49] <hlvwrk> One sec. trying that :P
[08:05:24] <i8ramin> can someone explain to me why this test returns "null" ... ? docs say $.extend ignores null values. http://jsfiddle.net/12kwnk4k/2/
[08:05:43] <Cork> i8ramin: your missreading the docs
[08:05:50] <Cork> "Arguments that are null or undefined are ignored."
[08:05:57] <Cork> arguments, not properties
[08:06:09] <i8ramin> i see.
[08:06:11] <Cork> and later "Undefined properties are not copied."
[08:06:15] <Cork> undefined, not null
[08:06:23] <i8ramin> thanks for the clarification
[08:08:28] <DaniG2k> omg this autocomplete thing is driving me insane
[08:08:30] <hlvwrk> Cork, so that works when increasing, but how would I only apply that logic when sliding right?
[08:08:31] <hlvwrk> http://jsfiddle.net/xeeL1z2y/6/
[08:12:08] <Cork> hlvwrk: http://jsfiddle.net/xeeL1z2y/7/
[08:12:41] <Cork> hlvwrk: also you might want to handle the overflowing of the handle by setting a left margin on the handle instead of fiddling with the value
[08:13:07] <DaniG2k> can someone help me with my autocomplete code please
[08:13:10] <DaniG2k> https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/c81a6a28ded03b27b122
[08:13:10] <hlvwrk> hm
[08:13:14] <DaniG2k> there are several issues
[08:13:38] <DaniG2k> first is, typing letters bears no relation to the results being returned in the autocomplete box: all results are always being returned
[08:14:00] <DaniG2k> the second is, items don't get removed (popped) from the list of terms
[08:14:03] <DaniG2k> -_-
[08:16:06] <DeafGoose> can anybody tell me what Im doing wrong? Im trying to check if country is empty but it never triggers the alert when select2 element has no value. If select2 value contains "US" the alert gets triggered. here is my code http://pastebin.com/d05DwYed
[08:18:15] <DeafGoose> sorry I meant when select2 contains a value different than US the alert gets triggered
[08:21:51] <dandaman> anyone ever use slick carousel here? the arrows aren't showing up for me after putting arrows: true as an option(and no, i don't have a white background, they simply aren't showing up)
[08:40:59] <gurke_> hi@all :)
[08:45:19] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  Prototype is adding and removing elements from a select list, I would like to detect this action with jquery - any suggestions?
[08:46:29] <MarcGuay> dandaman: I've used it.  Do you have navigation markup?
[08:46:38] <MarcGuay> With your previous and next arrows?
[08:49:01] <MarcGuay> dandaman: Or do you not need that to use the defaults?
[08:49:11] <MarcGuay> Can you see any navigation markup in the inspector?
[08:49:23] <reynierpm> guys why files are not send through Ajax request to the server on this code http://pastie.org/9758502 at line 75?
[08:52:12] <dandaman> MarcGuay: i can see the markup in the inspeector
[08:52:27] <MarcGuay> dandaman: Then it's a CSS problem I guess
[08:55:27] <reynierpm> any? I can not find what I am doing wrong
[08:57:31] <MarcGuay> reynierpm: Error msg?
[08:57:44] <reynierpm> none just not getting files on the request
[08:58:01] <MarcGuay> reynierpm: Do you see anything in the network tab of your inspector?
[08:58:19] <MarcGuay> If you look at the generated JS does it look good?
[08:58:32] <MarcGuay> The URL created is correct?
[08:58:51] <Nindustries> Hi, in jquery mobile, doesn't loading("show") show the spinner?
[08:59:04] <Nindustries>  ( http://jsbin.com/puvedeziyu/1/ )
[08:59:16] <BillCriswell> Nindustries: There's no .loading() in jQuery.
[08:59:29] <Nindustries> hm
[08:59:36] <Nindustries> Could have sworn I read that somewhere
[09:01:33] <reynierpm> MarcGuay in the network tab I can see the request to server side but the request var returns null also the post does not send any filenames
[09:03:32] <MarcGuay> reynierpm: so your 2 variables are not sent?
[09:03:48] <Kingsy> I am using jQuery(document).ready(function() { }); and I am referencing a element inside it however the element attr("src"); is undefined. why is this? Is it something to do with run order? if I wrap that document.ready in a $(window).resize(function() { then resize it.. it works
[09:03:53] <Kingsy> what am I missing?
[09:03:58] <reynierpm> no
[09:04:10] <reynierpm> I can not reach them on request on server side
[09:04:15] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Kingsy
[09:04:15] <b-ot> Kingsy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:05:01] <Kingsy> hmm there is alot of moving parts.. getting an example online is going to take a while
[09:05:11] <Kingsy> sorry I assumed I was doing something dumb that someone would just spot :D
[09:05:28] <robertmaxrees> Kingsy sounds like you're not setting the src attribut until after a resize.
[09:05:37] <robertmaxrees> or something similar.
[09:05:40] <MarcGuay> reynierpm: But can you see that they are sent properly?
[09:06:09] <reynierpm> MarcGuay waits let me try with Firebug under FF I do not like so much Chrome Developers Tools
[09:08:31] <reynierpm> MarcGuay it sends a object on the post request [object Object]
[09:10:30] <MarcGuay> reynierpm: So you only have 1 variable with an object as the content?
[09:10:58] <reynierpm> MarcGuay I think so
[09:11:26] <reynierpm> MarcGuay I am using Symfony2 in the server side but do not know how to reach a object from the request
[09:12:11] <MarcGuay> reynierpm: You should start by making sure that your jquery is sending the correct data.
[09:12:23] <MarcGuay> There is no "I think so", either it is or isn't.
[09:12:39] <MarcGuay> That sounds ruder than I mean it.
[09:13:11] <decx> just pretend you're yoda
[09:13:29] <reynierpm> MarcGuay Ummm ok let me see how I do it
[09:17:43] <Duvdevan> can you evaluate a javascript response with jQuery/Ajax?
[09:18:33] <robertmaxrees> Duvdevan you mean run javascript code?  because yes.
[09:20:11] <paulvd> hey dude, if i want to add important to .css, is this the right way ?
[09:20:19] <paulvd> .css('width', jQuerydiff + '!important'); ?
[09:21:14] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to add important if editing the element's css directly like that.
[09:21:54] <robertmaxrees> iirc, you can't do it using .css() normally anyway.
[09:22:22] <MarcGuay> paulvd: Add/remove a class instead
[09:22:37] <paulvd> i am adding value dynamically
[09:22:43] <paulvd> thats why cant use addclass
[09:22:47] <robertmaxrees> paulvd huh?
[09:22:50] <paulvd> what huh ?
[09:22:56] <robertmaxrees> if you can use .css(), you can use .addClass()
[09:22:57] <MarcGuay> sounds crazy to me
[09:23:03] <paulvd> jeez
[09:23:18] <paulvd> addclass will not solve the issue :)
[09:23:23] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[09:23:24] <paulvd> sounds crazy why?
[09:23:32] <paulvd> coz the value of width is dynamic
[09:23:41] <paulvd> depends on the browser window
[09:23:50] <robertmaxrees> refactor your CSS then and use media queries.
[09:23:52] <paulvd> and its a dropdown
[09:23:55] <paulvd> lool
[09:23:59] <paulvd> its a drop
[09:24:00] <paulvd> down
[09:24:01] <paulvd> menu
[09:24:09] <paulvd> is not a fixed element on page
[09:24:13] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change anything.
[09:24:17] <MarcGuay> enter the tumbleweed
[09:24:20] <paulvd> well in this case it does
[09:24:20] <robertmaxrees> use media queries.  that's what they're for.
[09:24:24] <paulvd> hey
[09:24:30] <paulvd> in this case
[09:24:37] <paulvd> are you new ?
[09:24:54] <paulvd> i am saying it is dynamic
[09:25:01] <paulvd> width can be anything
[09:25:07] <paulvd> media queries ?? are you kidding me
[09:25:14] <robertmaxrees> that's what they're for.
[09:25:15] <ciqsteve> Q:  If I have 3 <div>s, and 1 and 3 have content and are visible on the screen
[09:25:16] <paulvd> like make media queries for each screen size?
[09:25:17] <paulvd> rofl
[09:25:28] <paulvd> screen as in browser window
[09:25:38] <robertmaxrees> paulvd that's what they're designed for.
[09:25:38] <paulvd> browser window can be anything
[09:25:42] <paulvd> robert please
[09:25:43] <ciqsteve> if would  .is(':visible') on the 2nd div be true if it were empty?
[09:25:44] <paulvd> go to css
[09:25:49] <paulvd> if you advise things like that
[09:25:54] <NoiseEee> paulvd: honestly, your approach is wrong
[09:26:00] <paulvd> i know what media queries is for
[09:26:05] <paulvd> well in this case it is right
[09:26:11] <paulvd> and thats the only way
[09:26:16] <paulvd> its a position absolute div
[09:26:18] <paulvd> jeez
[09:26:55] <NoiseEee> paulvd: anyways !important has no effect on an inline element; the css itself should override any style
[09:27:11] <NoiseEee> so just setting someElement.css{width:someValue+'px'} should work
[09:27:35] <paulvd> ....
[09:27:47] <paulvd> there is no inline element there
[09:29:12] <robertmaxrees> show us some code, because obviously something is getting lost in translation.
[09:29:54] <reynierpm> guys I still need some help I am not able to see what is wrong http://pastie.org/9758502 as you can see there I handle DOM dynamic adding some elements on a change event for a Select2 component i do not know for example, if the code on lines 55~57 are in the right place for tell the dom about the existence of the new created elements and get the files from them
[09:30:49] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm use event delegation for those kinds of things instead.
[09:31:29] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees how is that? I never used it before
[09:31:38] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm check out the docs for .on()
[09:31:56] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});  it'll solve these problems for you.
[09:32:37] <EdwardIII> hey, is there a sane way i can embed my own jQuery? i.e. if i want to distribute an angular app so it relies on a newer version of jQuery?
[09:32:58] <EdwardIII> but i want someone to be able to embed it in their crappy 2011 website without changing their <head>?
[09:33:01] <robertmaxrees> EdwardIII you can specify a version as a requirement.
[09:33:08] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to be a good idea imo.
[09:33:20] <EdwardIII> yeah it's not perfect
[09:33:33] <robertmaxrees> is this a full angular app of some kind?
[09:33:35] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ok, so if I got this parent will be the element where new ones will be append, event of course change but child? the element itself? where I should write this on the $(document).ready() definition or inside the change event for the Select2
[09:33:53] <EdwardIII> it would be better to just throw 'hey your old jquery sucks, upgrade it' and then they fix their weird gallery plugin that relies on a quirk of jQuery 1.4 and everyone's happy
[09:33:54] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm the child would be the old target.
[09:34:03] <EdwardIII> but i'd like to try and work around that if possible heh
[09:34:08] <EdwardIII> robertmaxrees: in theory yeah
[09:34:17] <robertmaxrees> EdwardIII it's totally fine to tell people they need to use a minimum version.
[09:34:23] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees old target? not follow you
[09:34:55] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm so you'd go from $('someSelector').on('change', function() {}); to $('parentContainer').on('change', 'someSelector'), function() {});
[09:35:04] <EdwardIII> robertmaxrees: think it's possible though? i guess you could just sed 's/jQuery/jQueryForAngular' jquery.js angular.js # job done take the rest of the day off
[09:35:14] <robertmaxrees> EdwardIII don't do that.
[09:35:23] <robertmaxrees> make a minimum version requirement for jquery.
[09:35:24] <robertmaxrees> job done.
[09:35:27] <robertmaxrees> wash your hands of it.
[09:35:37] <EdwardIII> i'm exploring this
[09:35:56] <EdwardIII> i've seen people do that with requirejs & jquery etc. i know shimming is more popular now though
[09:35:58] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees fine, but how this should fit on the example code I leave? I mean I know how to write this but not where exactly
[09:36:14] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm outside of any inits or anything.
[09:36:16] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees and since elements are dynamic I do not know also how to pass the right values
[09:36:17] <EdwardIII> i wonder if it's possible to do something like this with shimming
[09:36:19] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm you bind once.
[09:36:31] <robertmaxrees> EdwardIII it's not going to be worth the headaches
[09:36:56] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees that is on $(document).ready() or even outside it?
[09:37:02] <robertmaxrees> inside of it.
[09:37:16] <robertmaxrees> does the parent elkement exist on pageload?
[09:37:28] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes it does
[09:37:34] <reynierpm> *it is
[09:37:36] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, just inside the document ready.
[09:37:42] <robertmaxrees> not inside any other event handlers or callbacks.
[09:38:15] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees waits a minute let me write a simple example on jsbin so you can take a look and guide me, could yo?
[09:38:27] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[09:40:15] <Nindustries> Hi, what am I doing wrong to show a spinning loader in jQuery mobile? http://jsbin.com/puvedeziyu/1/edit?js,output
[09:40:40] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees here http://jsbin.com/wovifuzede/1/edit?js,output see the lines between comments is that what you said?
[09:40:55] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:41:03] <robertmaxrees> that's a hude example
[09:41:06] <robertmaxrees> *huge
[09:41:22] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees the code between     // ------------------------
[09:41:25] <robertmaxrees> you mean line 59?
[09:41:40] <reynierpm> robert how do I see lines numbers on jsbin?
[09:41:50] <robertmaxrees> i copied that out of jsbin because i don't like it ;)
[09:42:10] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees hahaha waits a minute let me see if is the line I mean
[09:42:13] <robertmaxrees> you mean the $('#recaudoContainer').on('change', 'input[type=file]', function (event) { section?
[09:42:21] <robertmaxrees> because yeah, that's a delegated listener.
[09:42:34] <robertmaxrees> you're building a really fragile app though.
[09:42:36] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yep, that one
[09:42:51] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees what you mean with a fragile app?
[09:42:54] <robertmaxrees> don't set variables the way you are.
[09:43:02] <robertmaxrees> call functions and pass data explicitly instead.
[09:43:09] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll wind up with tons of race conditions.
[09:43:24] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees how is that? I am not a jQuery/JS expert
[09:44:00] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees I am planning moving all this code to Angular but have not time at the moment and need to show something to partners and clients for that reason my rush
[09:44:01] <robertmaxrees> i think you need to take a step back from what you're building and learn a bit about callbacks and effectively using them.
[09:44:12] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy.
[09:44:16] <robertmaxrees> it's always a rush job.
[09:44:25] <robertmaxrees> what you have should work i guess, buuuut.
[09:44:29] <devslash> I am trying to add an animation effect when you hover over the css menu so that the drop down menu rolls down using a nice animation instead of appearing but I just can figure out why it isnt working. this is my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/b2v7yhL2/2/ my jquery snipped doesnt seem to have any effect on the menu
[09:44:44] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees will do but right now can not
[09:44:54] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm right.
[09:45:28] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees so the code on line 59 is what you are talking about earlier?
[09:45:36] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees is fine?
[09:47:25] <decx> your sub-menu doesnt have the class sub-menu and your :hover css rule will make it appear before that even happens
[09:47:45] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees so lets move to the other issue I am having and it is on line 65 where I am trying to send files through ajax request but is not working since I get nothing on server side and nothing is send to the request from jQuery side I am not able to find what is wrong so if you can and want, could help me to reach the issue? I must alert you, I have copied that code from other site on Internet and try to get working on my environment but is not w
[09:48:47] <devslash> decx what do you mean
[09:49:10] <decx> i didnt use any metaphors
[09:49:22] <MarcGuay> sassy
[09:49:57] <devslash> how do i fix it
[09:50:20] <decx> remove the :hover css rule and add a sub-menu class to your submenu
[09:50:43] <decx> my first sentence was quite literal you see ^^
[09:52:06] <devslash> why does it need the submenu class ?
[09:52:30] <BillCriswell> If a browser supports transitions it supports animations, right?
[09:52:43] <BillCriswell> or am i over simplifying for the first time in my life?
[09:53:43] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm you said you're not very good with js/jquery - something tells me you should hire a developer at this point.
[09:53:59] <robertmaxrees> because it's real hard to help you in cases like this where i don't have access to your environment.
[09:55:15] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees have sense but I can not hire a developer I can get you access to my local environment through TeamViewer connection if you like
[09:55:24] <robertmaxrees> no thank you.
[09:55:30] <robertmaxrees> that's why you need a developer.
[09:55:38] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:55:41] <MarcGuay> what a kind offer
[09:55:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:56:03] <ciqsteve> $(window).on('scroll', function() {
[09:56:03] <ciqsteve> checkImagesVisible($(question).find('.question-images'));
[09:56:03] <ciqsteve> });
[09:56:10] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ok thx
[09:56:12] <ciqsteve> Q:  how can I turn this 'off'  ??
[09:56:13] <reynierpm> no problem
[09:56:16] <NoiseEee> $(
[09:56:17] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve please don't paste in the channel.
[09:56:20] <ciqsteve> but leave on other scroll events
[09:56:23] <ciqsteve> (sry my bad0
[09:56:31] <reynierpm> I will continue keep looking for a way
[09:56:51] <MarcGuay> ciqsteve: have you tried erasing it?
[09:56:57] <ciqsteve> http://pastebin.com/VQzArQjn\
[09:57:00] <ciqsteve> http://pastebin.com/VQzArQjn
[09:57:13] <ciqsteve> how can I turn that off but leave on other scrolle events?
[09:57:15] <dopie> hey guys im running into a problem with my script, currently i have fName mName and lName only fName and lName are required  mName is not, how do i make it where if mName has no value that it doesn't show undefined
[09:57:21] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve you could set a boolen that you check to know whether or not you should run that code.
[09:57:24] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/72b2257f26e90015b144
[09:58:19] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, in the function I do this... http://pastebin.com/zfXXS2RY
[09:58:41] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't change my suggestion?
[09:59:03] <robertmaxrees> dopie check to see if the .val() of that field is longer than 0, otherwise, set it to an empty string?
[09:59:09] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to change
[09:59:09] <robertmaxrees> if (fName && mName && lName ) {
[09:59:23] <decx> or define a fallback with |
[09:59:28] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[09:59:31] <ciqsteve> didn't quite follow.. are you suggesting I put a boolean in the anon function to check before I call checkImagesVisible?
[09:59:37] <decx> input.val() | 'fallback'
[10:00:04] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve or in the code of the function you're calling.
[10:00:20] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve i generally advise that you don't bind/unbind events.
[10:00:30] <robertmaxrees> bind them and check to see if you should run them instead.
[10:00:50] <ciqsteve> I do the later, can do the former.. but doesn't that leave a ton of overhead.. given how often scroll triggers?
[10:01:06] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[10:01:19] <robertmaxrees> the listener doesn't add overhead necessarily./  what the listener does can be the nasty party.
[10:01:22] <robertmaxrees> *part
[10:01:29] <ciqsteve> ok
[10:02:10] <ciqsteve> another issue I have is that I attach this event dynamically to each set of images I load.. so if I don't turn it off for images out of scope I could have 100's of these running at one time
[10:02:22] <ciqsteve> not images I load.. images that come into view
[10:02:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?  why are you binding that listener more than once?
[10:03:34] <ciqsteve> I need to have the $(question) in context to know what to check
[10:03:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd rethink your methodology there.
[10:04:03] <robertmaxrees> figure out how to not re-bind listeners.
[10:04:07] <dopie> robertmaxrees, how would i do that im a noob
[10:04:13] <robertmaxrees> bind once, call to functions that grab that data for you.
[10:04:49] <ciqsteve> hmm
[10:05:05] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're binding listeners multiple times.
[10:06:57] <ciqsteve> y.. is this permissible..
[10:07:07] <robertmaxrees> why is what permissible?
[10:07:12] <ciqsteve> $(window).on('scroll', '.some-element', function() { ..
[10:07:34] <ciqsteve> add the selector '.some-element'
[10:07:34] <robertmaxrees> event delegation?  or...
[10:07:40] <robertmaxrees> that's event delegation.
[10:07:48] <dopie> if mName.val().empty();
[10:07:48] <dopie> ?
[10:07:54] <robertmaxrees> dopie .length
[10:07:56] <devslash> dec i did what you said but it still isnt working http://jsfiddle.net/b2v7yhL2/7/
[10:07:57] <ciqsteve> does that work with window / scroll?
[10:08:04] <devslash> err decx
[10:08:08] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve do you know what event delegation is?
[10:08:19] <dopie>     if mName.val().length == 0();
[10:08:31] <robertmaxrees> dopie 0 isn't a function.
[10:08:38] <robertmaxrees> and use ===
[10:08:46] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve that code looks for all scroll events that are coming from .some-element
[10:08:50] <robertmaxrees> not what you want in this case.
[10:08:55] <dopie> so
[10:09:04] <dopie> if mName.val().length === 0();
[10:09:06] <ciqsteve> by my understanding attach the even to some parent, but only run it on matching selectors... I primarily use to to attach events to elements that I load dynamically (aren't there when I bind the event)
[10:09:11] <dopie> sorry im a noob
[10:09:13] <robertmaxrees> dopie 0 is not a function.
[10:09:20] <robertmaxrees> why are you putting () behind it?
[10:09:38] <hlvwrk> dopie. everyone starts somewhere :)
[10:09:41] <dopie>     if mName.val().length() === 0;
[10:09:57] <robertmaxrees> dopie length isn't a function either.
[10:09:59] <ciqsteve> I don't need it for that.. but if it works then I could use the same selector in the .off command and unbind only that and not the other scroll event
[10:10:01] <dopie> ARGHK$:L#@:L$#@
[10:10:02] <robertmaxrees> dopie if (mName.val().length === 0) {}
[10:10:14] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve that's not what delegation is for.
[10:10:22] <robertmaxrees> could you provide an example of what you're trying to do?
[10:10:33] <ciqsteve> I'm dynamically loading images
[10:10:35] <dopie> .val() is a function and .length is what a method?
[10:10:38] <hlvwrk> dopie: http://jsfiddle.net try it out.
[10:10:46] <robertmaxrees> dopie length is a property.
[10:10:55] <dopie> ok
[10:10:56] <ciqsteve> when the img hits the bottom of the viewport I load the image
[10:11:14] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve huh?  you mean you load a new image?
[10:11:26] <ciqsteve> real world example... I have 1000 10 page docs
[10:11:26] <hlvwrk> ciqsteve: fiddle an example?
[10:11:27] <dopie> so i only put () on functions
[10:11:37] <robertmaxrees> dopie and methods.
[10:11:40] <hlvwrk> dopie and methods
[10:11:41] <ciqsteve> I only load the doc when a user selects it.. and then only page 1..
[10:11:42] <hlvwrk> yeah
[10:11:42] <hlvwrk> lol
[10:11:43] <devslash> can anyone help me out ? http://jsfiddle.net/b2v7yhL2/8/
[10:11:55] <devslash> the jquery transitions arent working
[10:11:55] <ciqsteve> I load the other pages  as they come into view
[10:11:58] <dopie> thats what i figured ok, so length is a property not a method
[10:11:59] <dopie> hahah
[10:12:00] <dopie> :)
[10:12:50] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve and when you load in new content, you append it to the page, right?
[10:12:54] <ciqsteve> I need to check if one of those 10 pages comes into view.. not pages from the other 999 docs
[10:13:11] <dopie> thanks for not being assholes
[10:13:12] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve something isn't clicking here.  what does that have to do with adding/removing event listenerS?
[10:13:16] <ciqsteve> the img is loaded with the dom  with a data-src field that I copy to src
[10:13:22] <ciqsteve> err the image url
[10:13:33] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve i'm lost in your explanation at this point.  sorry
[10:14:02] <robertmaxrees> this is why self-contained examples are helpful.
[10:14:40] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees,  no worries..  I can't just checkImagesVisible against all possible images as there are 10,000 of them and I only care about 9... so I only check images in the doc in context
[10:14:54] <hlvwrk> devslash: i'm looking sec
[10:15:14] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, I'll figure something out.. thx for help
[10:15:17] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve it sounds like you convoluting something.
[10:15:22] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[10:16:35] <devslash> ok thanks
[10:25:16] <devslash> hlvwrk,any luck ?
[10:25:38] <hlvwrk> still looking at it. your css half the problem tho
[10:25:52] <devslash> why ?
[10:26:02] <devslash> oh btw i removed the hover css code
[10:26:23] <devslash> http://jsfiddle.net/b2v7yhL2/10/
[10:26:25] <hlvwrk> nav ul li:hover > ul {display: block;} that line?
[10:26:49] <hlvwrk> can't have that display:block, otherwise it'll override the transition
[10:26:59] <devslash> nav ul li:hover {
[10:39:32] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/oqd2wr56/1/
[10:39:40] <dopie> i cant even get it to work on jsfiddle
[10:39:40] <dopie> !
[10:40:04] <devslash> whats not working ?
[10:40:11] <dopie> everything
[10:40:11] <dopie> rofl
[10:41:33] <dopie> I want the initials to appear when the checkbox is checked
[10:42:28] <dopie> yay i got it working
[10:42:29] <dopie> :0
[10:43:16] <Cork> dopie: attr("checked", false)
[10:43:18] <Cork> don
[10:43:24] <Cork> don't use attr for properties
[10:43:28] <Cork> use prop
[10:44:37] <devslash> attr was deperecated in jquery 1.8
[10:44:48] <dopie> gots it!
[10:44:50] <Cork> dopie: ('.unique-check-class') <-- you're missing $ here
[10:44:55] <Cork> devslash: no
[10:45:03] <Cork> devslash: attr isn't deprecated
[10:45:20] <Cork> it is still arund only difference is that it is only for working with attributes now
[10:45:23] <dopie> Cork    $('.unique-check-class').change(function () {
[10:45:31] <dopie> ?
[10:45:44] <Cork> dopie: line 2
[10:47:43] <d0de> I'm trying to get a CSS triangle to work as an extension of a div with a background image. How can I make this work? http://jsfiddle.net/3bhmkgoo/1/
[10:48:48] <Cork> d0de: what do you mean extend?
[10:49:21] <dopie> Cork,  where is the needed i already have    $('.unique-check-class').change(function () {
[10:49:25] <dopie> $
[10:49:51] <dopie> oh wait
[10:49:55] <Cork> dopie: function resetCheckBoxes(){
[10:49:55] <Cork>     ('.unique-check-class').each(function(){
[10:49:56] <dopie> youre looking at the old version
[10:49:57] <dopie> soey
[10:50:13] <Cork> i'm looking at the code you shared
[10:50:19] <dopie> correct
[10:50:23] <dopie> i updated it my mistake
[10:50:48] <Cork> d0de?
[10:51:40] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/oqd2wr56/3/ now why isnt it working?!
[10:52:07] <dopie> ooops
[10:52:13] <dopie> have to do the else statement
[10:52:49] <Cork> and resetCheckBoxes is still broken
[10:53:49] <Cork> dopie: also i recommend replacing $(this).is(":checked") with this.checked
[10:55:16] <Cork> and your if case (line 20) is broken (nothing is ran with this case)
[10:55:45] <dopie> yeah just saw that
[10:55:46] <d0de> Cork, row 1 into row 2. So that row 1 is a rectangular image with a triangular extension of the same image on the bottom, with the triangular extension superimposed over row2
[10:55:51] <dopie> man i suck
[10:56:14] <Cork> d0de: ah, ya i suspected that is what you where trying to do, just wanted to be sure
[10:56:20] <Cork> d0de: it isn
[10:56:26] <Cork> isn't possible to do that
[10:56:44] <Cork> (why is ' always so stupidly positioned on laptops...)
[10:57:09] <d0de> Cork, is there some clever way I can fake it?
[10:57:40] <d0de> like, have a border on row2 that superimposes over row1 but with a triangular shaped hole in the middle?
[10:58:10] <Cork> d0de: best option i can think of is by using 4 elements
[10:58:23] <Cork> and create the arrow by covering the other blue areas
[10:58:35] <Cork> squar on the left, squar on the right
[10:58:45] <d0de> Cork, that's a good idea, I'll try it, thanks
[10:58:51] <Cork> and then two rectangles on each side rotated with transform
[10:58:59] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/oqd2wr56/6/
[10:59:04] <Cork> then you could get an arrow
[10:59:09] <dopie> why oh why!
[10:59:17] <Cork> d0de: a simpler solution might be to just use svg
[10:59:39] <Cork> and use the svg filters to map what to show of the image
[11:00:10] <Cork> dopie: hit tidyup in jsfiddle
[11:00:17] <Cork> if (mName.val().length === 0); <-- you don
[11:00:26] <Cork> don't have a case here
[11:00:55] <Cork> dopie: basicaly never ever use if without a block
[11:00:57] <dopie> rofl
[11:01:05] <dopie> got it
[11:01:17] <Cork> as else you easily get into indent lying to you
[11:02:35] <dopie> tidy up sure helps
[11:02:55] <Cork> ya, it makes helping ppl with code much simpler :)
[11:04:13] <dopie> ok NOW what the hell am i doing wrong this time
[11:04:16] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/oqd2wr56/9/
[11:04:50] <Cork> you still have the stray ; after the if case
[11:05:12] <Cork> so you have a block around the code now
[11:05:15] <Cork> but the block isn
[11:05:20] <Cork> 't for the if case
[11:05:33] * Cork kills his enter key...
[11:05:39] <dopie> rofl
[11:06:03] <Cork> the enter key is where ' is normally on my keyboards

[11:07:53] <mikehaas763> Anyone know if it's possible (without recreating the dialog) to update the html element used when creating a jquery-ui dialog with a template? like so: $(templateElement.html()).dialog({}) where templateElement is a script text/template element
[11:08:26] <Cork> mikehaas763: sure you can, just do .html(newContent); on the original element
[11:10:52] <mikehaas763> Cork, that won't work in my case because templateElement is a <script type="text/template" id="modal-temporary-password"> element
[11:11:02] <dopie> rofl Cork, this thing still breaks!!! argh
[11:11:22] <Cork> mikehaas763: uh, what does that have to do with anything?

[11:11:49] <mikehaas763> one sec
[11:12:03] <Cork> mikehaas763: create like $('#dialog').dialog();
[11:12:37] <Cork> mikehaas763: then you just do $('#dialog').html($('modal-temporary-password').html());

[11:15:48] <Cork> mikehaas763: if you want to update the dialog you have to be able to reference the element

[11:15:57] <Cork> so yes you have to have a reference to the element
[11:23:06] <nicoenarg> hey folks, i'm doing some stuff with jquery and select dropdown lists. Example code is pasted here: http://pastebin.com/wRnkgYGJ, there's two selects and when one changes, i try to grab the option from the other one as well but it returns null. I am sure i'm doing something extremely noobish but i can't figure it out
[11:23:57] <nicoenarg> it gets the value of the changing select fine. its the value of the other  select that i can't for the life of me figure out how to get
[11:24:01] <Cork> nicoenarg: always quote your attribute values
[11:24:14] <Cork> though that code should work
[11:24:15] <nicoenarg> Cork: is that where i'm screwing up?
[11:24:18] <nicoenarg> oh
[11:24:24] <dopie> ok now all my things are aligned correctly

[11:37:57] <dopie> nicoenarg, apt means apartment :)
[11:38:25] <robertmaxrees> dopie apt is alsso "appropriate or suitable in the circumstances."
[11:39:04] <dopie> robertmaxrees,  never seen that use for it... interesting

[11:45:27] <pll^> hey guys; lets say I have a <span class="foo" id="123">hello</span> -> I have a foreach loop, whereas the id attributes will be stored in this.id -> so if I want to reference the html found within that span, wouldn't: $('span.foo#' + this.id).html() return it?   seems like I'm getting undefined
[11:46:01] <robertmaxrees> you just want $('#' + this.id);
[11:46:10] <robertmaxrees> no reason for anything else.
[11:46:33] <pll^> unless i have other items with the same id
[11:46:37] <pll^> other spans
[11:46:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[11:46:41] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that.
[11:46:42] <robertmaxrees> fix that first.
[11:46:50] <pll^> so that should be a class then
[11:47:01] <pll^> ok, thanks robert
[11:47:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:47:11] <robertmaxrees> an ID can only exist per page once.

[12:11:21] <midori-rus> Hello there, I am trying to send ajax request by jquery post, it is works, but I have a problem. I wanna send array in params, but it doesnt sends. http://pastebin.com/ByqwKBHa
[12:11:25] <midori-rus> in 16 line
[12:11:39] <midori-rus> how to repair it?
[12:12:08] <jdo_dk> Im having a "div" where im trying to do $("#div_id").scrollTop(0); but it is not working. If im hitting the right div, should scrolltop(0) scroll div to top?
[12:14:45] <vanev_> jdo_dk: That will scroll the contents of the <div> to the top of the <div>, not the window.
[12:15:00] <revolve> Using $.post is there any way I can ignore a response depending on whether a search field is empty?
[12:15:12] <vanev_> jdo_dk: Also, I believe you just want `.scroll()`, instead of `.scrollTop()`.
[12:15:26] <jdo_dk> vanev_: Why ?
[12:15:36] <dopie> Cork, ok everything is working now except the alert box firing when the user does not input a first or last name
[12:15:38] <jdo_dk> I want to scroll to top of "div"
[12:15:38] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/oqd2wr56/17/
[12:16:15] <vanev_> jdo_dk: Just kidding, you can use `.scrollTop()`.
[12:19:00] <jdo_dk> vanev_ When using the "right" id, it seems to work. Strange. But cool. :D
[12:20:14] <vanev_> jdo_dk: Oh, I think the probably was that you don't need the "#" in the id when using $().
[12:20:45] <jdo_dk> im still having #my_id
[12:20:56] <jdo_dk> It that new "jquery" syntax ?
[12:21:22] <jdo_dk> vanev_ http://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
[12:21:40] <vanev_> jdo_dk: Wow, I'm way off today, aren't I.
[12:21:54] <jdo_dk> ;)
[12:22:28] <revolve> I've got a realtime search script that unhides a div once on('keyup') notices the .length of the search is 0
[12:23:19] <revolve> How can I get $.post.done() to ignore data it's just retreived via POST to the search url if the searchbar is empty?
[12:26:47] <Cork> revolve: search bar?
[12:27:18] <Cork> ah, an input field?
[12:27:45] <revolve> yis
[12:27:52] <Cork> revolve: so you just want to have an if case in the done handler checking if the input is empty?
[12:28:14] <revolve> am just experimenting now i can get term.length from withing the callback registered to $.post.done
[12:28:18] <Cork> if($('input').val().length < 1) { return }
[12:28:45] <Cork> revolve: should work just fine if you use an inline function
[12:28:53] <revolve> yeah it's essentially that, which is already there, to unhide the original listing and clear the search results div
[12:28:58] <Cork> meaning the variable should be accessable inside the callback
[12:29:05] <revolve> thanks
[12:29:26] <revolve> it seems i needed another check for term.length > 1
[12:35:33] <revolve> it appears to have worked
[12:37:29] <dewp> hey guys. I found an animation at a website which I want to use for my own. but as jqery on this page is packed I cannot extract the correct function. are you guys with eagle eyes able to help me out and point me to the animation which is used here (when hovering the white boxes) - or is it custom? http://www.epic-companies.com/team

[12:44:22] <bbclover> hey guys, when using the .ajax function, does the data property (is it called a property?) are we sending data to the url/server?
[12:44:44] <Robdgreat> yes
[12:45:08] <Robdgreat> that's the purpose of the .ajax function
[12:45:28] <bbclover> well we can get some data too right?
[12:45:50] <shoky> both, indeed
[12:45:51] <Robdgreat> yeah
[12:46:23] <bbclover> is ajax hard

[12:56:57] <Cork> oh, right; anyone interested in a copy of witcher 2?
[12:57:20] <bbclover> if I want to delay some show() or hide(), how would I do that?
[12:57:37] <bbclover> I tried $(something).hide().delay(5000);
[12:57:42] <Cork> bbclover: best solution is to use setTimeout
[12:58:10] <robertmaxrees> bbclover 2 things - 1: that's the reverse order for delaying like that, and 2: did you try google?
[12:58:19] <bbclover> yeah
[12:58:23] <bbclover> google is all lies
[12:58:35] <bbclover> I tried everything via copy and paste

[13:24:52] <fenris_kcf> hy. how can i select the target when using jquery-svg's load-method?
[13:25:13] <fenris_kcf> or can it only load to the svg-root?
[13:25:36] <dewp> there's element.slideDown();  and element.slideUp(); but I need it to slide sideways. is there any workaround you would suggest?
[13:28:40] <toothe> Is there a way with jquery or maybe a general ajax method to select a DOM object based on what the server says?
[13:29:32] <toothe> so, lets suppose my page has 100 <tr></tr> rows. When an event happens, I want to modify 1 and 2. Other times I want to modify 1, 3, and 5
[13:29:46] <toothe> which rows are modified is decided by the Server - it not a statically programmed value.
[13:29:49] <toothe> Is there a way to do that?
[13:30:34] <robertmaxrees> you can pass strings $('#' + someVar)
[13:32:03] <toothe> how is someva defined?
[13:32:04] <toothe> somevar*
[13:32:12] <robertmaxrees> like any other var
[13:32:29] <toothe> meaning, would this require multiple XML requests?
[13:32:44] <toothe> one to say "modify these <td> objects"
[13:32:48] <toothe> ad the others to say "with this text" ?
[13:33:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:33:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.
[13:33:22] <toothe> what actual objects (<td>'s) that are modified are completely arbitrary
[13:33:25] <toothe> (well, not completed)
[13:33:40] <robertmaxrees> in the .done() callback for your ajax call, you look at your returned data and do whatever you need to do to determine what needs to be modified.
[13:33:46] <toothe> so, a certain action will modify <td id=1> but not modify <td id=2>
[13:33:51] <robertmaxrees> you can then dynamically craft your selector string based on that.
[13:33:58] <toothe> hm...
[13:34:03] <toothe> i need to see an example.
[13:34:35] <robertmaxrees> of what part?
[13:35:03] <toothe> all of it - what the server sends back, how it is used to populate the selectors
[13:35:09] <toothe> how the content is sent.
[13:35:12] <robertmaxrees> ajax?
[13:35:45] <toothe> let me get a basic example working, I'm clearly not explaining this veyr wel.
[13:39:27] <robertmaxrees> toothe http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1002LaLy/
[13:39:35] <robertmaxrees> this is how you dynamically contruct a selector.
[13:39:38] <robertmaxrees> you can pass any string you want.
[13:39:49] <robertmaxrees> as long as that string evaluates to a valid selector.  make sense?
[13:39:55] <dewp> maybe somebody could have a look: http://jsfiddle.net/jonarrs/9q9bhk0w/ <- I'm using slideUp and slideDown here. But I want the text to appear on the right side with the same style
[13:40:00] <dewp> how could I achieve this?
[13:40:15] <dewp> as there's no slideRight()
[13:40:45] <robertmaxrees> dewp http://stackoverflow.com/a/4229482/923919
[13:40:56] <robertmaxrees> you have to manually do it.
[13:42:18] <toothe> almost one.
[13:42:21] <toothe> done*
[13:42:22] <dewp> I found this thread as well but tbh I don't understand how to reveal the text with that technique
[13:43:06] <robertmaxrees> toothe did you look at my example?
[13:43:13] <robertmaxrees> dewp what are you confused about?  did you try to use it?
[13:43:56] <dewp> yes, but not to intense (it just did not work in the first time and as the bar is shooting off the screen on this fiddle I thought it might not be what I'm looking for)
[13:45:06] <dewp> in the next step I want to have a div behind the text which is expanding to the right and then revealing the text
[13:45:14] <dewp> it's all placed above a picture
[13:45:42] <robertmaxrees> dewp you need to use .animate() for that, either way.
[13:46:47] <aias> should i always include $(document).ready with function when calling jquery in the <head> ?
[13:47:06] <aias> for calendars, graphs and things
[13:47:23] <robertmaxrees> aias pretty much.
[13:47:23] <robertmaxrees> otherwise jquery can't find anything on the page
[13:47:55] <toothe> gah.
[13:47:58] <toothe> robertmaxrees: no...i missed it>
[13:49:51] <toothe> robertmaxrees: but, what if what is highlighted is dependent upon the web application?
[13:49:59] <toothe> so, clicking 1 highlights 1 and 2
[13:50:09] <toothe> clicking foo highlights foo and bar, but not gaz
[13:50:10] <toothe> baz*
[13:50:13] <robertmaxrees> then look at the response from your server and run that logic
[13:50:21] <robertmaxrees> not sure what exactly you're lost with there.
[13:50:37] <robertmaxrees> is it the "looking at the server response" part?
[13:50:38] <toothe> and that's my question - how does the server send which elements to highlight?
[13:50:41] <toothe> yes.
[13:50:49] <robertmaxrees> do you have the backend setup for it?
[13:51:03] <toothe> how does the server send data and how does jquery interpret it?
[13:51:04] <toothe> yes...
[13:51:08] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax()
[13:51:33] <toothe> so, your response would be like content-type; text/html.....1 2 3
[13:51:37] <toothe> for elements 1, 2, 3 ?
[13:51:49] <robertmaxrees> your response would be whatever datatype you'd need it to be.
[13:51:56] <robertmaxrees> you could ship back JSON if you wanted.
[13:52:12] <toothe> i presume that's the standard?
[13:52:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm not entirely sure what you're trying to do, so it's hard to suggest anything.
[13:52:34] <robertmaxrees> but that tends to be favored in general.
[13:53:39] <toothe> i think im going to have to test this out a bunch
[13:53:57] <robertmaxrees> ajax is really simple.  start by crafting the response from your server.
[13:54:07] <toothe> right...
[13:54:10] <robertmaxrees> the jquery side is pretty simple once that's done.
[13:54:24] <toothe> its just a matter of interpreting it and using it.
[13:54:34] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing to interpret really.
[13:54:38] <toothe> sounds like an entirely doable challenge.
[13:54:56] <robertmaxrees> .done(function(theData) { console.log(theData) });
[13:55:02] <toothe> can I have ou debug some VERRYYYY simple jquery code?
[13:55:02] <robertmaxrees> simple stuff.
[13:55:09] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[13:55:31] <toothe> http://jsfiddle.net/8jz1e4dt/
[13:55:42] <toothe> i was hoping that when I click on one of the boxes, i would get an alert that said testing.
[13:55:53] <th3fallen> Anyone know the best shortest way to do this https://gist.github.com/th3fallen/184c1ac6955175d516ce
[13:56:02] <th3fallen> if its empty want to use the default value...
[13:56:06] <robertmaxrees> toothe var elements = $('#elements'); this doesn't make any sense
[13:56:13] <robertmaxrees> you probably meant .elements
[13:56:41] <toothe> yes, I had that before I hit save...
[13:56:52] <toothe> changed, but no alerts.
[13:57:04] <robertmaxrees> also, none of your .elements are inputs.
[13:57:08] <robertmaxrees> so they won't ever fire change events.
[13:57:33] <toothe> ohhhhhhhhhhhh
[13:58:18] <robertmaxrees> why are you using a table there?
[13:58:36] <toothe> no particular reason.
[13:58:38] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8jz1e4dt/1/
[13:58:49] <toothe> I updated it here: http://jsfiddle.net/8jz1e4dt/2/
[13:58:52] <robertmaxrees> use console.log instead of alert btw
[13:59:18] <robertmaxrees> also, generally you should wrap attribute values in quotes.
[13:59:29] <toothe> what did yours do that mine didn't?
[13:59:56] <robertmaxrees> my fiddle?
[14:00:01] <robertmaxrees> for startes i included jquery ;)
[14:00:02] <toothe> yes, compared to mine.
[14:00:08] <robertmaxrees> quoted attribute values.
[14:00:13] <robertmaxrees> used simpler markup.
[14:00:13] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[14:00:25] <toothe> no your function is almost identical.
[14:00:36] <toothe> and, i don't see any including of jquery
[14:00:43] <robertmaxrees> in mine?  the upper left dropdown
[14:01:06] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/Dp4M791.png
[14:01:24] <toothe> gah!
[14:01:26] <toothe> that'll do it
[14:01:29] <toothe> thank you...
[14:01:37] <toothe> slightly embarassed..
[14:02:52] <robertmaxrees> nah don't be.
[14:02:57] <robertmaxrees> learning the tools
[14:15:04] <bigwax> is it just me or are there a lot of methods for working with ajax
[14:15:11] <robertmaxrees> in jquery?
[14:15:21] <bigwax> success done fail complete ... ajax post get load
[14:15:24] <bigwax> yeah..
[14:15:32] <bigwax> i dont know which are deprecated
[14:15:33] <robertmaxrees> different ideas for each, but yeah.
[14:16:06] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs.
[14:16:08] <robertmaxrees> they'll tell you.
[14:17:42] <bigwax> ok here's what i gathered:
[14:19:00] <bigwax> .done() replaced .success()
[14:19:06] <bigwax> .fail() replaced .error()
[14:19:07] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[14:19:13] <bigwax> .always replaced .complete()
[14:19:26] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting things.
[14:19:30] <bigwax> no no i understand
[14:19:48] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily "replaced" - those are the defferred object methods.
[14:20:13] <bigwax> i mean, i understand they wouldnt just replace the words with new ones so what im wondering is how they differ
[14:20:22] <robertmaxrees> reread what i just said ;)
[14:20:23] <bigwax> deferred object methods?
[14:20:25] <bigwax> sec
[14:20:31] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[14:22:31] <Tomashe> Hey guys, anyone knows how to apply listview on none <a> links items?
[14:22:51] <Tomashe> it looks like it generate styling only for <a> links inside listview
[14:23:02] <cjohnson> bigwax: promises / futures / deferreds, all similar ideas. It lets you lazy-bind the success/fail handlers later
[14:23:45] <cjohnson> so you can compose the full ajax workflow without having to know what you're going to do with the response the moment you define the request
[14:23:54] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[14:23:59] <robertmaxrees> makes callbacks a lot easier.
[14:23:59] <bigwax> i understand the definition of deferred, like made for a later time (as in when the response comes in, do this function)
[14:24:38] <robertmaxrees> also lets you create objects that you can later bind callbacks to that'll do what you'd expect given what the object already died.
[14:24:38] <bigwax> but since i dont know how it currently works before the deferred methods were introduced, i cant quite understand but im reading up on it now
[14:25:46] <bigwax> but im seeing a lot of terms im not familiar with yet, lazybind (i know what lazy load is but not that), promises (heard of, not sure), futures (no idea)
[14:28:15] <bigwax> and from what i understand its just running an asynchronous function once its told to yes?
[14:28:25] <bigwax> as in once it has a response
[14:40:18] <dewp> robertmaxrees, i finally got it with css done :-) http://jsfiddle.net/jonarrs/m2raocuf/
[15:05:22] <matthewk> $('#Form1').submit(function() {              alert(2);             $(this).ajaxSubmit(options);              alert(3);             return false;          }); is there a reason the form submission would be causing the browser page to change , showing the result of the html from the form's processing action?
[15:05:54] <matthewk> i never see the alert(3), and i saw in examples to use return false to avoid the browser doing normal form submission..
[15:06:19] <matthewk> i see the alert(2) btw..
[15:07:07] <matthewk> var options = {          beforeSubmit:  validateForm,         success:       HandleResponse       }; // the validateform is not getting called..
[15:33:43] <sammych1> I ran into a very device specific issue yesterday: it was causing the main thread on the webapp to lock up a core. I traced down the issue to a change in a single CSS padding value
[15:46:18] <ceramicskulls> Is there a way to swap an anchored image, based on a hover of anchored text? They're inside the same div.
[15:58:52] <ceramicskulls> Essentially, I'm trying to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/m8ggst38/
[16:00:28] <robertmaxrees> "swap an anchored image"?
[16:01:52] <sammych1> something like div.somthing:hover > a { font-size:0; } div.something:hover > img { display:inline; }?
[16:02:03] <sammych1> wait, not even that
[16:02:07] <sammych1> just hide the a
[16:02:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m8ggst38/1/ you mean like this?
[16:02:42] <robertmaxrees> trying to understand the "Swap" thing.
[16:03:14] <ceramicskulls> robertmaxrees yes, that's it
[16:03:17] <ceramicskulls> :l
[16:03:33] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:05:00] <ceramicskulls> robertmaxrees Thank you!
[16:05:07] <robertmaxrees> do you see what the issue was?
[16:05:33] <ceramicskulls> Yes, I needed to locate the image first, then ready the image
[16:05:48] <robertmaxrees> sort of.  you were trying to find images that were descendents of the text.
[16:05:53] <robertmaxrees> you needed to go to the parent div first.
[16:05:56] <robertmaxrees> then look for the image.
[16:06:09] <robertmaxrees> could've done a sibling selector, as well, but i prefer my other method.
[16:07:39] <ceramicskulls> Yea, it's what I wanted either way and I understood the issue instantly.
[16:11:12] <ceramicskulls> robertmaxrees thanks once again! saved me a night of scratching my head lol.
[16:11:21] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[16:25:11] <reynierpm> I am working on a simple script that allow toggle selected/unselected all checkboxes and also the same behavior should apply to the new ones added dynamically, this is the script I have http://jsbin.com/potepi/1/edit?js,output but toggle all is not working also if I check all and uncheck one then the toggleAll button should get unchecked, what I am doing wrong?
[16:28:04] <robertmaxrees> use the change event instead of click for all inputs btw.
[16:28:49] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees well still now working
[16:28:57] <robertmaxrees> that's an aside.
[16:29:00] <robertmaxrees> just pointing it out.
[16:29:11] <robertmaxrees> let's back up.
[16:29:18] <robertmaxrees> what is thos trying to accomplish?
[16:29:28] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ok, thx for the suggesion I changed it
[16:29:36] <robertmaxrees> oh, and $('#idTbody').find("input:checkbox").on() - don't do this binding inside of the other event binding.
[16:30:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/piqiroboqu/1/edit?js,output you want something like this instead.
[16:31:52] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ok, fine I get it, well getting back to my issue, if I check the chk on the thead the first one the rest of them should be checked too, but if I uncheck one that one should be uncheck of course but the first one too since not all are checked, get it?
[16:31:58] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:32:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:32:12] <reynierpm> roebrtmaxrees clarify
[16:32:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm suggesting things that'll make your issue much easier to fix.
[16:32:52] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting your code.
[16:33:07] <robertmaxrees> you need to test if the check is being done via code or via the mouse.
[16:33:08] <reynierpm> i do not know what convoluting means
[16:33:13] <sniperh4x0r> What is the typical salary a primarily front end developer working on jquery css html and barely any php should make if they are in the boston area
[16:33:14] <robertmaxrees> complicating
[16:33:44] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm detect if the change occurred via code or the mouse.
[16:34:01] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees for now is via mouse click event
[16:34:26] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:34:35] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to also uncheck that top checkbox.
[16:34:35] <reynierpm> ?
[16:35:18] <reynierpm> what you mean with uncheck that top checkbox?
[16:35:30] <robertmaxrees> exactly what you're talking about.
[16:36:09] <reynierpm> ah ok, right, if I check the top the rest go check and viceversa, but if I uncheck any other than top then top should uncheck too
[16:36:17] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:36:18] <robertmaxrees> that's what i mean.
[16:36:21] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:36:26] <robertmaxrees> where's the problem then?
[16:36:37] <reynierpm> my code is not working
[16:36:50] <robertmaxrees> "not working" isn't helpful.  what part of it isn't working?
[16:36:51] <reynierpm> no js errors at console
[16:37:03] <reynierpm> try to check the top, nothing happen
[16:37:07] <robertmaxrees> have you tried stepping back and taking things one thing at a time?.
[16:37:11] <reynierpm> that is the first issue
[16:37:50] <reynierpm> yep, first get all check, should be done with first lines does not?
[16:38:11] <robertmaxrees> lol i'm saying you should remove all the extra code and focus on starting there.
[16:38:42] <reynierpm> i remove it (commented) and leave the one I will work only
[16:39:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:40:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/mumoloneze/1/edit?html,js,output
[16:40:02] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:40:03] <robertmaxrees> super simple.
[16:40:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying delete all your js because it's distracting you
[16:41:00] <phaidros> I am using bootstrap and try to use collapse. when I use an ID to toggle from my bootstrap button it works (but only for the first occurance), using a class doesn't work at all. tho, $('.Wetter').collapse('toggle') in js console with class set works on all rows. any hints? http://pastebin.com/7wb5eYDx
[16:41:31] <robertmaxrees> phaidros could you setup a fiddle?
[16:41:58] <phaidros> robertmaxrees: actually using express + jade .. is there something like a fiddle for thoase as well?
[16:42:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:42:10] <robertmaxrees> your markup is right now.
[16:42:14] <robertmaxrees> small, simple, self-contained.
[16:42:24] <phaidros> aye,ok
[16:46:08] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees so it working for both cases when I add a new checkbox dynamically or with the default ones, that is ok
[16:46:29] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees now how I uncheck top if at least one if uncheck?
[16:47:12] <robertmaxrees> add a delegated listener to #idContainer for all changes on child checkboxes.  if the .prop('checked') === false, uncheck #toggleAll
[16:51:03] <Tomashe> any jquery mobile professionals? i got question regarding footer. it seems like the footer always placed outside of the pages and when i navigate between the pages i just get multiple footers
[16:53:31] <robertmaxrees> Tomashe you're much more likely to get help if you show an example of the problem.
[16:54:17] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees take a look here http://jsbin.com/potepi/1/edit?js,console,output is working but try this, add a new dynamically and check it, top remains check that is right and if you uncheck top gets uncheck that is fine too, leave the new unchecked (top should be uncheck too) and a new one (dynamic way), check the previous one and you will see what happen, not all get checked and this is a issue, can you help me to fix it?
[16:54:37] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm slow down.
[16:54:42] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time yo.
[16:54:55] <robertmaxrees> walls of text and sweeping changes to your code isn't really going to help you much.
[16:55:14] <phaidros> grrr, fiddle is complexxxxx :)
[16:55:45] <robertmaxrees> phaidros it's easy.
[16:55:49] <robertmaxrees> what are you getting tripped up on.
[16:56:23] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees as I said code is almost working just this issue is remaining I followed your guide
[16:56:24] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm your function toggleAll(selector) {} is a terrible idea btw.
[16:56:42] <robertmaxrees> stop putting event bindings inside of other functions.
[16:57:01] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm let's go back to what I had - what should happen next in that example?
[16:57:38] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees I am trying to convert to a function because I will use the same over the site and for DRY
[16:57:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that.
[16:58:00] <robertmaxrees> don't put event bindings in functions like that.
[16:58:04] <robertmaxrees> that is exactly the wrong way to be DRY.
[16:58:07] <robertmaxrees> it causes more headaches.
[16:58:30] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees what is your suggestion? repeat the code over the development but changing, of course, selectors?
[16:58:32] <sammych1> the handler itself should be reused
[16:58:40] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm the handler is what you abstract.
[16:58:43] <robertmaxrees> not the binding.
[16:58:55] <robertmaxrees> but step back and solve this problem first.
[16:58:59] <reynierpm> ok
[16:59:01] <reynierpm> agree
[16:59:03] <robertmaxrees> slow down.  you're getting WAY ahead of yourself.
[16:59:12] <reynierpm> right :-(
[16:59:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/kunuzawubu/1/edit?js,console,output
[16:59:37] <robertmaxrees> without abstracting anything or making this "more DRY", get the code in that unchecks that parent checkbox.
[17:00:20] <reynierpm> done
[17:00:26] <robertmaxrees> share the link.
[17:00:39] <reynierpm> http://jsbin.com/himux/1/edit?js,output
[17:00:54] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[17:00:57] <robertmaxrees> what next?
[17:01:12] <reynierpm> add dynamic rows (tr) using the button
[17:01:24] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/biquledevu/1/edit?js,output
[17:01:25] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[17:01:26] <phaidros> so far, I have some code. tho in the fiddle nothing works :)
[17:01:27] <robertmaxrees> what next?
[17:01:28] <phaidros> http://jsfiddle.net/ydzscg6o/
[17:01:39] <robertmaxrees> woah phaidros
[17:01:45] <reynierpm> done, in the same link
[17:02:09] <robertmaxrees> phaidros put the external resources in using the external resources link.
[17:02:18] <robertmaxrees> also, the drop down in the upper left is where you included jquery.
[17:02:19] <phaidros> robertmaxrees: aye, I saw that to late :)
[17:02:34] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm okay.  what next?
[17:03:13] <phaidros> fixing that
[17:03:20] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees apply the same as before meaning check top rest is check even dynamic added, uncheck one of them top gets uncheck
[17:03:33] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm right - that part works now ;)
[17:03:39] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees that works too
[17:03:50] <robertmaxrees> so what doesn't work now?
[17:04:03] <phaidros> http://jsfiddle.net/ydzscg6o/1/ so, cleanud up the mess :)
[17:04:13] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees right, now add a new dynamically and check it, top remains check that is right and if you uncheck top gets uncheck that is fine too, leave the new unchecked (top should be uncheck too) and a new one (dynamic way), check the previous one and you will see what happen, not all get checked and this is a issue
[17:04:28] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees did you get it?
[17:05:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:05:23] <robertmaxrees> i see an edge case where all are checked, but adding a new one doesn't remove the top one.
[17:05:37] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees  exactly
[17:05:45] <reynierpm> that is the remain issue
[17:05:53] <robertmaxrees> that just involves testing for that in the #addNew clkick handler
[17:05:56] <robertmaxrees> phaidros what was your issue?
[17:06:18] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees meaning? I not follow you
[17:06:31] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm which part?
[17:06:32] <phaidros> goal is that pressing the buttons toggle the rows (in)visible by category. In my live code it works using id=$category for the tr, but only fot the first occuring id, using class=$category for the rows the buttons do not work, but I can easily toggle it with $('.Wetter').collapse('toggle') in the js console
[17:06:47] <robertmaxrees> "first occuring ID"?
[17:06:53] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees this that just involves testing for that in the #addNew clkick handler
[17:07:00] <robertmaxrees> phaidros you can't use an ID more than once./
[17:07:12] <phaidros> yeah, id is a single entity .. I was just playing around and discovered that
[17:07:30] <phaidros> so I wonder why the button applies to IDs but not to classes
[17:07:34] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm right - so when you add a new checkbox, test to see if the top checkbox is checked.  if it is, unckeck it.
[17:07:55] <robertmaxrees> phaidros because it's meant for entire sections of sites, not columns of tables.
[17:09:05] <phaidros> robertmaxrees: alright, how do I toggle hiding of multiple rows in a table ?
[17:09:34] <phaidros> funny thing is, $('.Wetter').collapse('toggle') in js console it works perfect
[17:09:34] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees http://jsbin.com/himux/1/edit?js,output is not working
[17:10:04] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm check your syntax for line 18
[17:10:05] <robertmaxrees> the is checked bit
[17:11:25] <phaidros> robertmaxrees: from my understanding bootstrap collapse is just offering that, tho I am a lousy coder :)
[17:11:36] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees fixed that one but still one issue
[17:11:38] <robertmaxrees> phaidros go to google, but be aware that dealing with styling on tables like that is kind of a pain.
[17:12:38] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm and that is?
[17:12:41] <phaidros> robertmaxrees: what might be the difference between pressing those buttons and actual js conole run?
[17:12:54] <robertmaxrees> phaidros those buttons are selecting on ID.
[17:12:57] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess.
[17:12:59] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees http://jsbin.com/himux/1/edit?js,output check all of them by mark the top, that works, add a new one with button new, top gets uncheck, let me know when you´re at this point
[17:13:10] <robertmaxrees> okay
[17:13:40] <phaidros> heh, so, how to make them class aware then?!:)
[17:13:50] <robertmaxrees> phaidros dunno.  i'm not a bootstrap expert ;)
[17:14:01] <robertmaxrees> head to ##bootstrap
[17:14:15] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm fyi i'm at work sooo....
[17:14:22] <phaidros> ah, thanks, didn't know it exists :)
[17:14:52] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees meaning you can not do it?
[17:15:04] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm meaning i can but I can't just sit here and wait forever.
[17:15:08] <robertmaxrees> i am where youa sked me to be.
[17:15:10] <robertmaxrees> what next?
[17:15:11] <reynierpm> ah ok
[17:15:14] <reynierpm> sorry
[17:15:30] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees without mark the last one (the dynamic) add a new one dynamic but hit the button again you should have value1, value2 checked, top uncheck and latest two uncheck too
[17:15:43] <reynierpm> let me know
[17:15:48] <robertmaxrees> hit what button again?
[17:15:54] <reynierpm> new
[17:15:56] <robertmaxrees> done.
[17:15:58] <robertmaxrees> just type it dude.
[17:16:06] <robertmaxrees> like, the whole thing.
[17:16:23] <reynierpm> ok now check the value1 that is not check (the first one dynamic)
[17:16:31] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:16:31] <reynierpm> get top checked for you?
[17:16:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:16:40] <reynierpm> that is the issue
[17:16:46] <reynierpm> the last one still no marked
[17:16:53] <reynierpm> so top should not get marked
[17:17:02] <robertmaxrees> right...
[17:17:12] <robertmaxrees> your logic in     $('#idContainer').on('change', 'input:checkbox', function() { is broken.
[17:17:18] <robertmaxrees> if (!$(this).is(':checked')) {
[17:17:26] <robertmaxrees> your testing only the current
[17:17:35] <robertmaxrees> *you're testing only the current checkbox, not all of them.
[17:18:00] <reynierpm> how do I check all of them
[17:18:19] <robertmaxrees> try google first ;)
[17:18:33] <reynierpm> $(this) on line 7 refers to the current input or the whole container
[17:18:41] <robertmaxrees> the current input
[17:18:41] <reynierpm> ?
[17:18:47] <robertmaxrees> i just said this.
[17:19:10] <reynierpm> so I need to use .find() and look through each input and see if it is check or not
[17:19:16] <robertmaxrees> there's an easier way.
[17:19:19] <robertmaxrees> try google.
[17:19:19] <reynierpm> that´s what you said?
[17:19:21] <robertmaxrees> seriously :)
[17:19:40] <reynierpm> well yes but I do not know which query to looks for
[17:19:41] <robertmaxrees> no, i just said you need to see if all the checkboxes are checked.
[17:19:52] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery test if all checkboxes checked
[17:19:53] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: jquery - Check if all checkboxes are selected - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5541387/check-if-all-checkboxes-are-selected
[17:27:19] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees here http://jsbin.com/potepi/1/edit?js,console,output
[17:27:28] <reynierpm> still not working
[17:27:36] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:27:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:27:58] <reynierpm> still having issues with dynamics ones
[17:28:08] <robertmaxrees> it has nothing to do with dynamic checkboxes.
[17:28:13] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/5541507/923919
[17:28:17] <robertmaxrees> this is exactly what you need to so.
[17:29:10] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to test the current checkbox.
[17:32:13] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ughhh not works again http://jsbin.com/potepi/1/edit?js,console,output check all and add new by hit new btn, should not top gets disabled?
[17:32:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:32:41] <robertmaxrees> are you actually trying anything at this point?
[17:33:03] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes for sure get this working
[17:33:11] <robertmaxrees> i don't believe you.
[17:33:12] <reynierpm> *trying to get this working
[17:33:15] <robertmaxrees> you're reversing other fixes.
[17:33:28] <reynierpm> of course
[17:33:35] <robertmaxrees> if ($('#toggleAll').is("checked")) {
[17:33:41] <robertmaxrees> you already corrected this earlier.
[17:34:09] <reynierpm> yes but with new code it gets down
[17:34:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:34:22] <robertmaxrees> fix that line again.
[17:34:26] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[17:34:41] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/yibedazaxu/1/edit?js,output
[17:34:44] <robertmaxrees> really simple stuff dude
[17:34:59] <reynierpm> ahh
[17:35:02] <reynierpm> i was fixed already
[17:35:07] <reynierpm> missing :checked
[17:35:09] <reynierpm> my bad
[17:36:16] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees now around DRY what is your suggestion lets said I will use that code 50 times on my website but with different selectors of course, what you suggest me
[17:36:40] <robertmaxrees> use semantic classes and select on those instead.
[17:36:51] <robertmaxrees> widgetize your stuff.
[17:39:57] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees woooooo is like you are talking in chinese to one people that only knows spanish
[17:40:16] <robertmaxrees> which parts aren't you understanding?
[17:40:52] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ok waits you mean use .someclass instead of goes through IDs?
[17:40:54] <reynierpm> that?
[17:41:03] <robertmaxrees> yes.  use semantic classes.
[17:41:07] <robertmaxrees> instead of selecting IDs.
[17:41:23] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes, sounds good
[17:41:30] <reynierpm> and applies DRY
[17:41:33] <robertmaxrees> i assume by "50 times on my site", you mean on different pages.
[17:41:41] <reynierpm> sure
[17:41:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then use classes.
[17:41:52] <reynierpm> or complex dynamic forms
[17:42:03] <robertmaxrees> if it's on the same page, you'll need to widgetize this a bit more.
[17:42:08] <reynierpm> where the same behavoir apply
[17:42:18] <robertmaxrees> and handle all your logic relative to a containing element.
[17:42:34] <reynierpm> hmmm that gets more complicated for me
[17:42:44] <robertmaxrees> this is why you hire a developer ;)
[17:42:58] <reynierpm> as I see here the only code I´ll repeat is the button part
[17:43:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:43:36] <reynierpm> can not, could you imagine hire you and paid in BSF? I am on venezuela here $ (American Dollars) is lost like dinosaurs
[17:43:36] <robertmaxrees> if you have multiple controls like the example you have here, you'll need to do a lot of relative work against where events emitted from.
[17:43:47] <robertmaxrees> "BSF"?
[17:43:56] <reynierpm> is the money type here
[17:43:58] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused - are you a developer?
[17:44:02] <reynierpm> yes
[17:44:07] <reynierpm> pretend to be one
[17:44:13] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:44:22] <reynierpm> but I am not a frontend I am a backend
[17:44:32] <robertmaxrees> then learn frontend?
[17:44:34] <reynierpm> in this project I am working on both skills
[17:45:01] <reynierpm> I will do when days have 100 hours 24h is not enough for me :-)
[17:45:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:45:34] <reynierpm> nevermind
[17:45:40] <robertmaxrees> you'll spend less time churning out higher quality projects.
[17:51:38] <acidjazz> any1 here play advanced warfare?
[17:52:18] <robertmaxrees> kind of OT for the channel :)
[17:54:09] <Robdgreat> some people think anything computer-related is on topic >.>
[17:54:18] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[18:02:14] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: :)
[19:10:32] <lonejack> Hello, I would like to start to write my plugin on jquery and it seems that a plugin is "something" written in a correct style under $.fn.newPlugin. Okay, but, when I see some functions that go under $.someFuncts. Whot do these mean?
[19:10:37] <lonejack> thank you
[19:11:08] <cjohnson> $.fn is for $(someSelector).something
[19:11:31] <cjohnson> so $.fn.each is $('div').each vs $.each which is used as such: $.each(['a', 'b', 'c'], function...
[19:11:56] <cjohnson> .fn is the prototype for jquery collections
[19:15:25] <lonejack> cjohnson, thank you, now the last qst what are the functions appended directly to jquery ?
[19:20:55] <lonejack> cjohnson, for example http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#protecting-the-alias-and-adding-scope
[19:20:57] <reynierpm> should not this code http://jsbin.com/juqaq/1/edit?html,js,console return false if any td.has_pais_dist is empty? I need to check whether all td.has_pais_dist has text or not if all have text my code should return true otherwise will be false, but I am getting true, why?
[19:24:58] <reynierpm> any?
[19:51:06] <alexut> http://jsfiddle.net/x0nx80jg/ why do i get undefined is not a function ? :(
[19:52:51] <systemfault> alexut: Your code just doesn't make any sense.
[19:53:07] <systemfault> If you declare a addBackground function, you can't just magically call it on jQuery objects
[19:53:17] <alexut> oh
[19:54:21] <alexut> well, i do like magic, but if it's not possible this way what can i do ?
[19:55:51] <systemfault> alexut: You'd need to do something like http://jsfiddle.net/x0nx80jg/1/
[19:56:40] <BillCriswell> Though... .css() seems useful enough
[19:56:42] <BillCriswell> ?
[19:56:59] <alexut> yea, code is larger
[19:57:15] <alexut> thank you
[20:25:59] <Prometheian> For testing/learning purposes, I'm trying to inject javascript into a query param that is run using eval(). However I can't seem to get an actual javascript function injected correctly. Would anyone mind pointing me towards the right google search, or what code is needed to get a test case working?
[20:26:22] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[20:29:08] <pll^> hey guys, whats the best suggestion -> while on a page, I want to run a file.php script located on server every X seconds, what should I use for that?
[20:29:13] <pll^> jquery? js?
[20:35:11] <bigwax> not sure but couldnt you use a setinterval to make an ajax request every x seconds?
[20:35:22] <bigwax> < doesnt know what hes doing
[20:35:36] <bigwax> what does the script do
[20:52:28] <respek> I built a thing http://codepen.io/Gabrielmtn/pen/NPGoLr
[21:24:49] <bigwax> oh jeeez
[21:38:43] <reynierpm> any here?
[21:38:48] <reynierpm> I nees some help
[21:40:41] <reynierpm> how do I get data-recaudos from this <a data-recaudo="3" data-backdrop="static" data-target="#subirRecaudo" data-toggle="modal" href="javascript:void(0)" class="btn btn-default dataRecaudo"><i class="fa fa-upload"></i> Subir recaudo</a>
[21:42:22] <shebbi> reynierpm: $value = $('a').attr('data-recaudos').value();
[21:42:36] <reynierpm> thanks
[21:44:25] <Uhkis> or $('.dataRecaudo').data('recaudo');
[22:52:18] <ussher_> I've used serializeArray() to get an array with names like not_wanted_apples not_wanted_pears and wanted_foo wanted_bar.  how can i get rid all of the wanted_ values to where just the name is left.  with php id use list() and explode().  Im trying to figure it out using split() right now.
[23:10:36] <gtristan> Let's say I have a DOM node 'node' (not a jQuery object), how can I select all of the children which have a given attribute set ?
[23:11:09] <gtristan> ah, I guess 'find' is for me
[23:11:48] <gtristan> interestingNodes = $(node).find ('[pony]');
[23:12:39] <gtristan> should get all the children of the DOM node 'node' which have <element pony='anything'/>
[23:13:22] <versatiletech> ussher_: you can use $.map and return null if the beginning of the string equals "wanted_" http://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/
[23:13:46] <versatiletech> that'll remove those items
[23:16:03] <ussher_> cheers versatiletech  I'll go check that out.  much appreciated
[23:17:07] <versatiletech> gtristan: if you're only caring about direct descendants (just one level down from the parent) use children() instead
[23:17:43] <gtristan> versatiletech, thanks, but I do need all descendants here actually :)
[23:18:03] <gtristan> it's already an encapsulated fragment, not an entire page
[23:25:20] <john100> anyway i can use jquery to print something (background color) ONLY to the margins of a div?
[23:26:01] <Cork> john100: no you can't set background colors on margins
[23:27:25] <john100> ok, i guess not images then either
[23:27:41] <Cork> background color on an image?
[23:27:51] <Cork> well you can, but only if the image is transparent
[23:28:12] <john100> background image
[23:28:33] <Cork> you can't set a background at all on a margin
[23:28:44] <Cork> you can add a wrapping element around the element and set its background
[23:28:51] <alderin> what's the command to change nick here?
[23:28:51] <Cork> but you can't set a background outside an element
[23:28:57] <john100> aight thanks
[23:29:03] <Cork> alderin: same as on any irc servers
[23:29:06] <john100> oooh how?
[23:29:15] <john100> does it work on margin: 0 auto centered divs?
[23:29:23] <Uhkis> /nick newnick
[23:29:31] <john100> i need something just around that centered div
[23:29:48] <Cork> john100: as long as you make sure that the wrapping element takes the full width of the parent, sure
[23:30:22] <pranavpremium> I need help with a big script, any chance I could pm someone? I promise not to be too much of a bother, I'm new to java that's why
[23:30:43] <Uhkis> javascript != java ;-)
[23:30:58] <pranavpremium> Yeah, javascript I meant :P
[23:31:30] <Cork> john100: http://jsfiddle.net/e60f01mL/
[23:32:54] <john100> Cork: thanks, ya i need the centered(blue) div to have transparency through to another 100% div that is under both those (red &blue) divs , I'm not sure there's a solution
[23:33:11] <Cork> john100: there isn't
[23:33:33] <Cork> john100: you can't poke a hole through another element
[23:33:47] <Cork> john100: best option is to load the same content again in the inner div
[23:34:04] <john100> hmmm
[23:34:14] <sammych1> I want to be able to be able to mask an element
[23:34:36] <john100> Cork: thanks how would that work?
[23:34:47] <Cork> "john100: best option is to load the same content again in the inner div"
[23:34:55] <pranavpremium> anyone I could pm?
[23:35:07] <Cork> ?ask @ pranavpremium
[23:35:08] <b-ot> pranavpremium: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:36:03] <john100> Cork: well I'm not sure what you mean that's why I asked how it would work
[23:37:18] <Cork> john100: uh, you add the content you want to see through the element inside it again
