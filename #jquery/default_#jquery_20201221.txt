[16:00:48] <catbeard> anyone familiar with canvasjs with multiple line plots?
[16:03:43] <catbeard> trying to graph event counts by minute over the past 24 hours using AJAX datasource for the dataPoints, but the dataPoints need to be for each server
[16:04:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in ##javascript instead catbeard
[16:04:12] <catbeard> so having to iterate through the keys and do servers.includes(hostname) checks, i'm using $.each()
[16:04:49] <robertmaxrees> maybe i'm not clear on the quiestion and how it relates to jquery - mind clarifying what the issue it?
[16:04:51] <robertmaxrees> *is
[16:05:15] <catbeard> https://i.imgur.com/ouQKE2X.png
[16:05:32] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing actual code instead of a screenshot?  that way I can play with it?
[16:05:52] <robertmaxrees> also share an example of the data you're getting back?
[16:06:09] <catbeard> it's in the ss
[16:06:24] <robertmaxrees> can you share it as actual code in, say, a jsfiddle then?
[16:06:24] <catbeard> actually one sec
[16:06:33] <catbeard> yeah i had one but i closed it yesterday
[16:06:40] <robertmaxrees> also: that format isn't valid javascript.
[16:06:50] <catbeard> it doesn't work remotely
[16:06:59] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[16:06:59] <catbeard> because the API is ip restricted
[16:07:02] <robertmaxrees> that's OK.
[16:07:08] <robertmaxrees> just share the code and some sample data.
[16:07:15] <catbeard> ok gimme a few
[16:18:12] <robertmaxrees> need any help there?
[16:19:45] <robertmaxrees> catbeard
[16:20:08] <catbeard> sorry took me a minute
[16:20:09] <catbeard> https://jsfiddle.net/9fxpb50m/
[16:20:14] <catbeard> https://kopy.io/YgtFz#8jGIWqViooJ3Pu
[16:21:10] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[16:21:12] <catbeard> also yeah i know j doesn't exist
[16:21:14] <catbeard> ok so
[16:21:18] <catbeard> per the kopy
[16:21:40] <catbeard> i'm trying to graph a db full of event count rates measured per minute
[16:21:54] <catbeard> but graphed over 24 hours for multiple servers
[16:21:57] <catbeard> in a single request
[16:22:02] <robertmaxrees> slow down
[16:22:20] <robertmaxrees> i mean specifically what's your question?
[16:22:49] <catbeard> well 1, how do i do what you think i'm trying to do around line #38
[16:22:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:23:02] <robertmaxrees> i can't tell what you're trying to do :)
[16:23:24] <catbeard> so i'm creating a subkey in servers for with the name of hostname if it doesn't exist
[16:23:28] <robertmaxrees> i see an $.each in a for loop which is a bad idea and extremely confusing.
[16:23:29] <catbeard> then push the row data to that subkey
[16:23:41] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you're trying to transform an array from one format to another?
[16:23:45] <catbeard> yes
[16:23:56] <robertmaxrees> can you provide a more fleshed-out example of your data then?
[16:23:58] <catbeard> and push canvasjs datasets per-server
[16:24:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:24:10] <catbeard> that's the exact format
[16:24:12] <robertmaxrees> slow down - one thing at a time :)
[16:24:13] <catbeard> of the output
[16:24:28] <catbeard> canvasjs expects array of objects
[16:24:33] <robertmaxrees> dude
[16:24:45] <catbeard> as dataPoints
[16:25:01] <robertmaxrees> slow down - we're not at canvasjs yet.  doing array transformations with an array with a length of one helps nobody.
[16:25:15] <catbeard> ok
[16:25:25] <robertmaxrees> can you provide a more fleshed out array example?
[16:25:51] <catbeard> which array, the response or servers[] ?
[16:26:05] <robertmaxrees> the response.
[16:26:08] <catbeard> sec
[16:29:34] <robertmaxrees> to clarify: array transformations are pretty straightforward.  just need to see what you're starting with and what you're looking to wind up with.
[16:33:28] <robertmaxrees> is it particularly difficult to get a sample response from the server?
[16:34:05] <catbeard> well no but pasting it is another thing
[16:34:09] <catbeard> it's 1.8MB of text
[16:34:16] <robertmaxrees> :|
[16:34:19] <catbeard> and it got truncated in developer tools
[16:34:26] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:34:34] <robertmaxrees> i just need, like, 4 or 5 of the objects.
[16:34:37] <robertmaxrees> not the whole thing.
[16:34:39] <catbeard> oh
[16:34:40] <catbeard> xD
[16:35:11] <robertmaxrees> https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions - we're just trying to get a reduced test case.
[16:36:17] <catbeard> https://kopy.io/ITyPm#uWDK8ZSA1KG7CB
[16:37:55] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so servers should end up being an array of arrays?
[16:38:04] <robertmaxrees> wait no - an object of arrays?>
[16:38:18] <catbeard> an array of arrays of objects
[16:38:37] <robertmaxrees> can you show what that would look like for one object?
[16:39:01] <catbeard> line #33 of the fiddle
[16:39:10] <robertmaxrees> i read the code.
[16:39:13] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't make sense.
[16:41:06] <catbeard> so each "line" in canvasjs represents different axisXIndex particular to the hostname represented in the stats for each server, each hostname subkey of servers[] would contain an array of points to plot in the Y axis with event_minute being the tick value for the X axis
[16:41:14] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[16:41:19] <robertmaxrees> hat that would look like for one object?
[16:41:19] <robertmaxrees> [2020:12:21:13:40:59] <catbeard> line #33 of the fidd
[16:41:23] <catbeard> i can't just pass in dataset[]
[16:41:24] <robertmaxrees> woops
[16:41:24] <robertmaxrees> https://bpa.st/WA2A
[16:41:32] <robertmaxrees> is this what you want the output to be?
[16:41:34] <catbeard> so i have to create multiple datasets
[16:41:38] <robertmaxrees> stop
[16:41:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm asking really basic questions and you're not answering them.  if you'd like help, please slow down.
[16:42:10] <robertmaxrees> look at the paste i just gave - is that the format you need?
[16:43:51] <robertmaxrees> if not, please provide an example of the data you'd like.  saying things like "each hostname subkey of servers[]" is confusing because that doesn't mean anything.  your code (and language) implies that servers is an array, but you do not use it as one.
[16:44:04] <robertmaxrees> you're declare an array and then interact with it as if it were an object.  hence my confusion.
[16:44:49] <robertmaxrees> this is also why i keep asking for an example of the output you want.  otherwise, i cannot help, because there's a clear disconnect and confusion around things like arrays vs objects.
[16:45:02] <catbeard> i don't know what format i need servers to be in , that's the problem, to iterate it properly, but i think it needs to be this format
[16:45:03] <catbeard> https://bpa.st/QTGA
[16:45:19] <catbeard> not entirely sure if that's correct syntax
[16:46:09] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid js whatsoever.
[16:46:24] <catbeard> i figured not but does that make any sense
[16:46:30] <robertmaxrees> no, it doesn't.
[16:46:46] <robertmaxrees> can you link to the docs of the library you're using?
[16:46:56] <robertmaxrees> so we can see what foramt it's expecting?
[16:47:15] <catbeard> https://canvasjs.com/javascript-charts/multi-series-line-chart/
[16:47:21] <robertmaxrees> because as-is, your code and sample data makes absolutely no sense :)
[16:47:45] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:48:05] <robertmaxrees> so for starters - can you modify your server to properly output data in this formati instead?
[16:48:09] <robertmaxrees> *format
[16:48:55] <catbeard> hmm i mean yeah i guess i could, would take a lot more time server-side
[16:49:23] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean more time?
[16:49:44] <robertmaxrees> is your server particularly slower than a desktop?
[16:49:44] <catbeard> to format the return from the api in that exact format
[16:49:53] <catbeard> no, just ~3M records
[16:50:08] <robertmaxrees> that will be much faster than the network and client-side overhead.
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> that dataset is incredibly large.  to make the client handle that transform doesn't make any sense.
[16:51:35] <robertmaxrees> also: to clarify - the data you feed to canvasjs is an array of objects.  the dataPoints property within each object is also an array of objects.
[16:51:40] <catbeard> yeah, pre-canvasjs, canvasjs itself boasts that it's able to handle 100,000 points with ease, but i'm guessing that's directly passed to dataPoints with it already in the correct format, and just graphing 1 line
[16:52:02] <catbeard> yes that's correct
[16:52:15] <robertmaxrees> canvas can do it, but the client still has to process and transform that data.
[16:52:20] <catbeard> gotcha
[16:52:22] <robertmaxrees> you said there are 3 million datapoints?
[16:52:32] <catbeard> and growing at ~1k/minute
[16:52:36] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:52:42] <catbeard> for another table anyway
[16:52:46] <catbeard> sorry
[16:52:53] <robertmaxrees> o think you need to completely re-think your strategy here.
[16:52:58] <catbeard> the rates table is updated once per minute from every server
[16:53:02] <robertmaxrees> because this is not going to be a sustainable solution.
[16:53:16] <catbeard> that's what i'm graphing from, not the 3M records table
[16:53:46] <robertmaxrees> lol you're not making any sense.  are you trying to graph 3 million records or no?
[16:53:48] <catbeard> would be #servers inserts/minute
[16:54:15] <catbeard> well i thought i'd get this to work first, but also no i wouldn't graph 3M only searched subsets
[16:54:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you want to push this transform server-side.  doing this client-side, especially when you don't know JS basics, is only going to make things more difficult.
[16:55:25] <catbeard> ok so even if i do the transform server-side and have it already in the right format
[16:55:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:55:40] <catbeard> where do i go from there to iterate it into the correct line per-server
[16:55:46] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[16:55:55] <robertmaxrees> you output the data correction in the first place.
[16:55:59] <robertmaxrees> *correctly.
[16:57:13] <robertmaxrees> this is what you need for the data: property that you pass to the charting lib - https://bpa.st/VNNQ
[17:00:47] <catbeard> okay
[17:02:06] <robertmaxrees> i would also go look up some JS tutorials - you're doing yourself a massive disservice by not understanding the basics.
[17:15:06] <catbeard> so in PHP
[17:15:10] <catbeard> or lumen at least
[17:15:12] <catbeard> https://bpa.st/2L4A
[17:15:18] <robertmaxrees> i don't know php.
[17:15:27] <robertmaxrees> i would ask in a channel about php :)
[17:37:55] <catbeard> this might work - https://bpa.st/VWHA
[17:38:03] <robertmaxrees> ok
[17:38:04] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[17:38:07] <robertmaxrees> dunno PHP
[17:39:15] <catbeard> trying to imitate the array of objects in php so it will work in JS
[17:39:33] <catbeard> will give it a shot and lyk
[17:39:40] <robertmaxrees> lol ok??
