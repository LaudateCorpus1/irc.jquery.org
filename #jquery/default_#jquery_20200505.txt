[11:18:39] <muffinskin> when you have a jquery object that contains multiple elements from different parts of the DOM, how do you cycle through the elements requiring a click action for next?
[11:36:06] <muffinskin> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/XWmVYGX
[11:37:12] <dw1> apparently no official way to list events
[11:39:33] <muffinskin> does .index() show the order in which an element class appears in the dom?
[17:32:10] <codecutter> how can I make make that the tooltip remain within the browser visible area? e.g. if there not enough space left on the bottom them display the tooltip above the link? i have moved the link to the bottom of the window but when I hover it still displays the tooltip below it https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/o74z5dcv/17/
[17:32:57] <codecutter> make sure*
[17:37:53] <dw1> might be hard with that absolute idk
[17:38:26] <codecutter> i placed that there to make it go to bottom. it can be removed
[17:38:42] <codecutter> let me do margin-top instead
[17:38:55] <dw1> pooper aint perfect sometimes dropdowns go off screen too
[17:39:00] <dw1> sucks
[17:39:03] <dw1> popper* lol

[17:47:22] <codecutter> Cork: i was using popper but removed it
[17:47:30] <codecutter> dw1
[17:48:36] <codecutter> popper doesn't seem to remain inside the parent container
[17:48:58] <codecutter> most of the time it works but display is all over the place

[17:56:01] <codecutter> taplar u there?
[23:09:06] <robertparkerx> how would I get ?lang=en from a url
[23:09:21] <robertparkerx> or whatever trailing ?lang=
[23:12:28] <Feldmaus> Use the URLSearchParams API instead
