[01:09:26] <rahuldroy> hi guys, I was wondering how you would stop advice a person about that there is unsaved data on a form when they try to redirect. This is my code so far - http://jsfiddle.net/mvYc3/. The issue is that the message keeps popping up even when the form is "submitted" which I don't want
[01:14:48] <jop008> I am building a framework using PHP and jquery for fast making nice web applications using MySQL and jQuery mobiile anyone interested to help me with this? One of the objective is to minimize code and making consistent applications based on a meta model.

[02:11:34] <patsToms> morning, there is some random interesting fact about jCanvas
[02:12:04] <patsToms> I can`t use it with images which source is cross domain

[02:12:44] <patsToms> any ideas?
[02:25:04] <Kartapux> Hi everyone.
[02:25:06] <Kartapux> I believe my question is quite common. However I could find clear cut solutions that worked for me on the internet.
[02:27:42] <Kartapux> I'm using jquery $.post to get some information on my server, that is returned on xml. To store this information in a variable accessible outside the callback function.
[02:28:44] <Kartapux> And I'd like to avoid global variables
[02:43:27] <Kartapux> Ok... Well, i guess it's symply not a good idea to do this kind of things. I'll try to rethink my program ;-)
[03:14:18] <daniel31> I have a stupid n00b question about variable visibility. I'm trying to modify a jquery library I found online but I can't access the this.settings objects. (http://pastebin.com/gjD6U1dy - line 7.) The full fiddle is here: http://jsfiddle.net/Cy3Ln/

[04:18:48] <gast__1> I'm a jQuery beginner and followed this tutorial (http://designyourweb.info/so-einfach-macht-man-ein-jquery-popup/91), how do I call the function inside the js-file without clicking a link?

[04:41:11] <uskerine> hi, I would like general guidelines on what should I do to do the following. I have a form to add records to a database, once user push submit button I would like he to receive a message like: data succesfully added and maybe change the button submit for "clear and add more records") or display an error message if data was not added properly
[04:49:50] <Raydiation> can i listen on element creating
[04:50:43] <gast__1> is somebody here that answers our questions? would be very nice :)
[04:51:11] <Raydiation> i have this code that gets all elements and checks them on every click on the document https://dpaste.de/1YaB#L16
[04:51:34] <Raydiation> the downside of this is that if i create an element dynamically the buttons will not change
[04:51:50] <Raydiation> if i put the query inside the click function, i will get a full dom search on every click
[04:51:56] <Raydiation> which sounds horrible

[05:00:05] <paulvd> i will try on the domain now
[05:00:15] <paulvd> it loads another page in that same domain
[05:01:15] <Raydiation> then remove the http jazz

[05:59:59] <gast__1> In the head of my html I did <script type="text/javascript">$( document ).ready($("popup_oeffnen").trigger("click"));</script>, but I can't see the function result (a div with information). Can somebody help, pls.
[06:01:25] <gast__1> my popup.js is shown here http://designyourweb.info/so-einfach-macht-man-ein-jquery-popup/91
[06:07:03] <decx> missing curly braces
[06:09:09] <gast__1> what do you mean?
[06:09:58] <decx> $( document ).ready(function() { zeug() });
[06:10:45] <decx> or short: $(function() { zeug() });
[06:12:19] <gast__1> tried this without success <script type="text/javascript">$( document ).ready(popup_oeffnen(){.trigger("click")});</script>
[06:13:38] <decx> i already gave you the answer
[06:14:07] <gast__1> sory I don't understand your answer, what am I doing wrong?
[06:14:10] <decx> http://try.jquery.com/
[06:25:31] <gast__1> ?
[06:26:27] <decx> there's no point in trying to help further unless you grasp at least the basics of dom ready, selectors and methods related to jquery
[06:27:15] <gast__1> sounds harsh to me, I am just searching my error that's all.
[06:27:30] <decx> i can give you the solution but then you're here tomorrow with the same problem because you only copied it
[06:27:34] <decx> this is basic stuff
[06:27:44] <decx> complete the try page
[06:27:50] <decx> then you'll know
[06:29:13] <decx> it's not harsh
[06:29:57] <decx> btw that article is shit, and that is meant harshly :>
[06:31:01] <gast__1> I already spent 2h with the try page and that's only because I tried to show a div :(
[06:31:23] <pragma-> $(div).show();
[06:37:10] <gast__1> thx pragma, but for this I didn't need jquery as i bypasses my jquery show function. I guess I view enother 30minutes and see if that helps.
[07:09:08] <gast__1> ok I got my error I tried to call the function instead of hiding a clickable link and call trigger on that.
[07:09:36] <gast__1> it is working now, I don't think I will adventure in this strange framework any further

[10:45:10] <consultationist> Hey everyone - question with the load event. I tried the method in this post with two image DOM elements. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3736098/jquery-chaining-load-requests The results were unreliable (sometimes it loads other times it doesn't).
[10:45:33] <consultationist> Then I found this note http://api.jquery.com/load-event/ and I was wondering how people usually handle multiple images?
[10:45:43] <consultationist> ...for preloading
[10:45:58] <Vivekananda> hey guys
[10:53:43] <javed_7134> anybody can help
[11:50:37] <frank_o> Are there any jQuery plugins that allows you to remove a specific color from an image?
[12:05:06] <noregret> if i want to cancel the execution of a click in a certain condition, should I just "return" in the click evenr of a button?
[12:05:09] <decx> frank_o jquery doesnt do stuff like that
[12:09:16] <decx> frank_o http://jsfiddle.net/decx/9TK9g/ use canvas
[12:12:19] <Vivekananda> noregret: you can assign a click function to the button and do  element.preventDefault() ;
[12:13:34] <frank_o> decx: Sweet !!
[12:14:42] <frank_o> decx: Basically I got some photos of chicks posing in the latest fashion and I want to remove the white background around them (silhouette-like).. i do not, however, want to remove any white color they might be wearing
[12:15:16] <frank_o> having said that, is canvas still an option?
[12:15:34] <noregret> Vivekananda: so is it a better option than a return?
[12:15:35] <tandroid> frank_o you should look at chroma key
[12:16:05] <frank_o> tandroid: hey now..
[12:16:55] <tandroid> seriously.js has a way to do it. it's usually what is used for a green screen but there is no reason why you couldn't use it to remove a white background.
[12:17:03] <decx> frank_o oh i wouldnt rely on js for that, there are many many many many thousands of hours that programmers spent on coming up with solutions for that p
[12:17:12] <decx> roblem
[12:19:04] <frank_o> yep.. wow what can i say
[12:19:15] <frank_o> this is exactly what i want, thanks so much decx tandroid
[12:19:25] <decx> frank_o http://www.hmp.is.it/creating-chroma-key-effect-html5-canvas/
[12:19:48] <frank_o> decx <3
[12:21:14] <decx> still, unless you want to use it on a video like in seriously.js i'd rely on more mature algos from photoshop or whatever and serve the right assets from server
[12:22:19] <tandroid> seriously.js works on images just the same as videos, but I agree. it's not going to work all the time.
[12:22:48] <decx> yeah it works great but right tools for the jobs and all that jazz
[12:22:55] <tandroid> Yeah for sure
[12:24:17] <frank_o> it's from product images im pulling in from the likes of http://www.net-a-porter.com/ and unfortunately they all have white backgrounds
[12:24:34] <frank_o> all that jazz :)
[12:24:56] <decx> this is why i give all my productboxes white bg ;D
[12:25:17] <frank_o> :)
[12:25:55] <frank_o> but here though some of these products are gonna be overlapping so then it doesnt look good when the white bgs overlap as well
[12:26:08] <tandroid> frank_o: I really don't think you'll be able to get rid of that white background consistently with chroma key.
[12:26:51] <frank_o> oh.. not good
[12:27:24] <tandroid> you might be able to crop out anything that isn't white.
[12:27:36] <frank_o> lets try it out on some lingerie :P
[12:27:41] <decx> yeah that's why they use green for chromakey
[12:27:42] <frank_o> really?
[12:27:46] <decx> because every color has white in it
[12:27:52] <decx> :>
[12:29:26] <decx> or rather white has every colour in it?
[12:29:33] <decx> on of those
[12:29:35] <decx> one*
[12:29:57] <frank_o> hehe idk
[12:31:31] <frank_o> so seriously.js or http://www.hmp.is.it/ ? we have a fine example here (no pun intended) where the chick is also wearing white -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Ujs6L/
[12:32:20] <frank_o> probably no go on this one =/
[13:19:00] <uskerine> i have several IDs named "id1" "id245" "id133" etc.
[13:19:11] <uskerine> so they begin with id -or whatever- and then a number
[13:19:34] <uskerine> can i make jquery to react to "onclick" of all those objects and retrieve the number?
[13:24:15] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You'd be better off with like... <div class="something" data-id="234"> instead of <div id="something234">
[13:26:04] <BillCriswell> uskerine: If you can't modify the HTML though, $('div[id^=something]') can work, then the id number would be like id = $(this).attr('id').slice(9);
[13:32:14] <gvo> I'm trying to delete all but the last 3 rows of a table.  From google I see that something like this is supposed to let me list each td element but it's not working.    ("td").each(function() {});
[13:32:36] <gvo> Error is undefined is nto a function
[13:32:41] <gvo> not
[13:32:47] <BillCriswell> gvo: You forgot the $
[13:32:54] <gvo> Oops.  Thanks.
[13:34:25] <BillCriswell> gvo: You'd probably want to look into .slice for that task.
[13:34:46] <gvo> OK
[13:35:00] <BillCriswell> gvo: Do you want rows of columns?
[13:35:46] <gvo> No, just want to delete all the rows.
[13:35:54] <gvo> All but top 3.
[13:36:13] <gvo> I do need to limit it to one table however.
[13:36:51] <BillCriswell> gvo: You said rows, then used tds in the example and nwo you're saying you want the top 3.
[13:37:06] <gvo> Sorry, you are right.
[13:37:19] <gvo> tr not td.
[13:37:30] <BillCriswell> Ok, so first three rows of a table?
[13:37:38] <gvo> Retain, yes.
[13:37:42] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[13:37:58] <BillCriswell> Ok, I'd do $('.some-table-class-name tr').slice(0, 3).remove()
[13:38:52] <frank_o> decx, tandroid -- getting closer: http://examples.hmp.is.it/chromakeycanvas2.php
[13:39:39] <gvo> Wont that remove the top three?
[13:40:04] <tandroid> frank_o, Nice!
[13:40:10] <tandroid> but it's not quite there...
[13:40:20] <BillCriswell> gvo: then .slice(-3)
[13:40:31] <gvo> OK thanks.
[13:40:32] <frank_o> tandroid: nope :(
[13:43:17] <gvo> BillCriswell: That didn't work.
[13:43:34] <gvo> Neither did slice(3,10)
[13:44:11] <frank_o> tandroid: any ideas?
[13:44:18] <BillCriswell> gvo: http://jsbin.com/carenufo/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:45:16] <tandroid> frank_o, Not really. how are the images going to be overlapped? like on girl in front of another or are they just going to be close together?
[13:45:54] <BillCriswell> gvo: I don't know where you got 3,10 from
[13:46:23] <gvo> I just made it up.
[13:46:30] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[13:46:39] <gvo> I guess that's not a range, is it.
[13:47:00] <BillCriswell> No that can work if you wanted to remove the 3rd to 10th row.
[13:47:20] <BillCriswell> Well, 4th to 11th
[13:47:43] <gvo> I've got a 13 element table and I wanted to remove/replace the last 10.
[13:47:54] <tandroid> frank_o: if the background will still be white, I would just do a close crop with php using the GD library.
[13:48:12] <BillCriswell> gvo: $('table tr').slice(-10).remove()
[13:49:52] <frank_o> tandroid: girl on girl basically (parallax.js)
[13:49:57] <gvo> RIght.  Thanks
[13:50:16] <tandroid> oh.... yeah, you need photoshop man.
[13:50:24] <frank_o> haha
[13:51:01] <frank_o> yep i guess theres no way around this one
[13:51:13] <tandroid> No way you're going to get it that close consistently using chroma key
[13:51:20] <BillCriswell> gvo: No problem.
[13:53:22] <gvo> Got it working, thanks.
[13:54:18] <BillCriswell> gvo: No problem at all.
[13:56:09] <frank_o> tandroid: well just because one dream goes down the drain doesnt mean one cant have others
[13:56:16] <frank_o> plenty of fish out there
[14:46:24] <uskerine> thanks BillCriswell,  I can go  with data-id="234" -I guess i can retrieve with $(this).attr('data-id') makes more sense-
[14:46:53] <BillCriswell> uskerine: $(this).data('id')
[14:47:06] <uskerine> ok, thanks
[14:47:42] <uskerine> another question, so far I have used succesfully: data: $("#addNewCustomerForm").serialize()
[14:47:51] <uskerine> so i submit via AJAX a whole form
[14:48:09] <uskerine> how could I include just that data-id field as if it were a form field -that's the single field I need to send-
[14:49:27] <shoky> data: { "id": $(element).data('id') }
[14:51:25] <Vivekananda> hello BillCriswell shoky  nice to see you guys
[14:51:41] <shoky> helo
[14:51:50] <uskerine> thanks
[14:52:48] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Howdy.
[14:53:09] <Vivekananda> doing okay . Just about to read about delegetation and how to use it :)
[14:54:32] <frank_o> Anybody know how to integrate Snap.js (http://jakiestfu.github.io/Snap.js) with jQuery Mobile? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/vZBzD/4/
[14:54:35] <frank_o> Works fine without jQuery Mobile: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/5X4K9/11/
[14:57:37] <uskerine> can i do $(".actionClass").click(..... over an <a class="actionClass" .....
[14:58:00] <shoky> if it already exists in the DOM, sure
[15:00:41] <uskerine> so, $(".action-view").click(function() { alert("HH"); });     should alert when i click this item, right?: <a class="tip action-view" title="Ver" href="#" data-id="4"">  <i class="icon-address-book"></i> </a>
[15:01:07] <uskerine> I just saw the fault, there is an extra "
[15:03:13] <uskerine> nah, still not working. <a class="tip action-view" title="Ver" href="#" data-id="4"> <i class="icon-address-book"></i> </a>
[15:03:15] <uskerine> am i missing something?
[15:03:15] <frank_o> uskerine: <i>?!? :D
[15:03:32] <tw2113> oh fontawesome
[15:04:04] <frank_o> didnt know people still used <i> to be frank
[15:04:08] <shoky> <i> for icon
[15:04:21] <frank_o> aha
[15:04:50] <tw2113> i think they're just hopping on a short "fitting" tag
[15:04:56] <uskerine> it is an icon
[15:05:21] <uskerine> i am using a preexisting template, which uses things like:
[15:05:22] <uskerine> <a href="#" title="Twitter" class="tip"><i class="icon-twitter"></i></a>
[15:05:25] <frank_o> uskerine: you could always put the icon on a:after
[15:05:55] <uskerine> but why jQuery is not intercepting the click event on the <a
[15:06:01] <tw2113> according to the w3c spect stuff, it's still meant for "The <i> tag should represent a range of text with a different semantic meaning whose typical typographic representation is italicized."
[15:06:21] <shoky> uskerine: does it exist in the DOM already when you're adding the event handler?
[15:06:40] <uskerine> oh!
[15:06:51] <uskerine> maybe not, as that stuff is loaded by another AJAX request
[15:06:57] <uskerine> so everything is asyncronous, right?
[15:07:10] <shoky> should be
[15:07:40] <uskerine> how could I "wait" so the elements exist in DOM (they are loaded by datatables AJAX request)
[15:07:42] <shoky> you probably want to use event delegation. something like $('#container').on('click', '.action-view', function...
[15:07:56] <shoky> where #container already exists in the DOM
[15:08:00] <uskerine> ok
[15:08:04] <uskerine> i will try that thanks shoky
[15:10:03] <uskerine> now it works and i understood why it was not working, thanks shoky
[15:10:20] <shoky> make sure you understand why it IS working now :)
[15:10:27] <shoky> read about .on() and event delegation
[15:10:28] <uskerine> I understand that too ;-)
[15:10:54] <tw2113> shoky, true or false?
[15:11:12] <uskerine> -or at least i think so-
[15:11:38] <tw2113> return one :D
[15:12:04] <shoky> i'll starve trying to decide, tw2113
[15:12:15] <tw2113> i'll starve waiting for you to decide
[15:12:18] <shoky> :D

[15:43:49] <uskerine> any tip on how to populate a form with values retrieved from AJAX request? which kind of object should the service return and how AJAX could populate the input fields of the form?
[15:45:15] <noregret> if i want add code like google analytics, is it ok to add it within $(function() { }) ? or should it be outside ?
[15:45:19] <dcope> for instance... if i have a click selector on ".main-item", and another element becomes ".main-item" after the document loads... how can i get the new main item's click to work?

[16:31:59] <odisa> Hi, I'm new to jQuery. I want to do something that should be relatively very simple, but I can't seem to get it done. I have a fixed image on my site that I want to fadeOut upon scrolling, and fadeIn upon scrollheight being back to the start. site: http://odisa.tk , script: http://pastebin.com/hDtcncu7
[16:32:41] <odisa> what am I doing wrong? I tested the jQuery import with a quick .append, and it works, so that's not it
[16:35:07] <BillCriswell> odisa: I think you want window scrollTop, not document.
[16:39:10] <odisa> BillCriswell: I'll check, thanks. Having bad timing with connection issues, so I'll report back in a moment
[16:39:20] <BillCriswell> ok.
[16:43:21] <odisa> BillCriswell: both document and window work.. I was missing a ')' -.-
[16:43:37] <BillCriswell> odisa: Ah, good times.
[16:44:05] <odisa> BillCriswell: haha yep.. do you know of a jQuery syntax checker I can use to prevent this in the future?
[16:44:23] <BillCriswell> odisa: Your console should have mentioned something.
[16:45:03] <BillCriswell> odisa: Look in the chrome menu for developer tools.
[16:45:04] <odisa> BillCriswell: I'm typing it in a plain FTP window.. I guess I'll use Brackets from now on.. I think that covers JS and jQuery as well
[16:46:16] <BillCriswell> odisa: It would be in the browser.
[16:46:19] <BillCriswell> Not your editor.
[16:47:06] <BillCriswell> Though, using a text editor with syntax highlighting it should be immediately obvious when something is wrong due to odd coloring.
[16:48:00] <odisa> BillCriswell: I see.. FireFox does return a missing parenthesis error when in Inspect Element > Console, but not which line etc.
[16:48:16] <odisa> any better option for FireFox, or just use Chrome?
[16:48:49] <BillCriswell> odisa: It should tell you which line. Look to the right of the error.
[16:49:36] <odisa> BillCriswell: Ahh thanks.. got some visual neglect going on, didn't notice that
[16:52:20] <BillCriswell> odisa: Happens.
[17:07:02] <NikkiL92> Hi Everyone, I'm learning to play around with jquery, but i'm running into this odd issue.  Using this code: http://jsfiddle.net/urJnv/ the "Yes - No" shows up on a new line under the same <li>.
[17:07:12] <NikkiL92> Anyone have an idea why? or can point me in the right direction to read up on?
[17:07:51] <antlong> how can I make the travel button show a modal with the solar system thats on the bottom of the page, when clicked? www.multiverseminer.com
[17:10:17] <BillCriswell> NikkiL92: Your CSS might have <a>s to display block or something there.
[17:10:35] <BillCriswell> There's nothing in the code you provided that would cause it to break to a new line.
[17:12:04] <NikkiL92> BillCriswell: thanks let me check
[17:13:20] <NikkiL92> BillCriswell: Thanks, it was set.  Now I know what that does
[17:13:32] <BillCriswell> NikkiL92: Sweeeeeeet.
[17:14:11] <NikkiL92> BillCriswell: Thank you!
[17:15:07] <BillCriswell> No problem at all.
[17:27:47] <zylophone> if i want to wrap a container div around the outside of the first element, is .wrap the right method?
[17:28:25] <zylophone> i do $('> *', $(html)).eq(0).wrap(...) and it wraps the first element inside the first element
[17:53:03] <BillCriswell> That should work.
[17:53:10] <BillCriswell> The $(thml) part may not be needed.
[18:27:27] <naeluh_sat> hello ?
[18:29:12] <superjacaman> hey!
[18:29:28] <naeluh_sat> weird hey anyone know anything about canvas ?
[18:29:38] <naeluh_sat> hey is there a way to improve my function redraw ? it seems to be lagging I have tried debouce methods and rAF but nothing seems to work ? heres my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/4h7GR/7/
[18:32:25] <mr_blue> hi all
[18:32:45] <mehwork> whenever i hover over a link i apply some css, but sometimes it stays highlighted/applied after certain events. what jquery would remove that?
[18:34:02] <mr_blue> How to assign the data retrieved via getJSON inside the success function
[18:34:03] <mr_blue> ?
[18:34:46] <BillCriswell> mr_blue: It's the first argument of the success function.
[18:35:49] <mr_blue> var otherVar = undefined; $.getJSON('/url', function(data) { this.otherVar = data; }); console.log(otherVar); <<< this gives me undefined for otherVar.
[18:36:17] <superjacaman> mr_blue: you need a callback
[18:36:45] <mr_blue> superjacaman: where do I put this collback
[18:38:11] <superjacaman> the callback can be a function and you need to call the function after you assign the this.otherVar = data
[18:39:34] <mr_blue> sorry superjacaman I do not see what you mean ?
[18:41:29] <superjacaman> mr_blue http://jsfiddle.net/Zuw5L/ try something like this
[18:44:13] <mr_blue> superjacaman: great thank you
[18:44:29] <superjacaman> =]
[18:44:48] <mr_blue> no way to use the data outside a function ?
[18:45:33] <superjacaman> outside the getJson no
[18:47:25] <mr_blue> superjacaman: I updated the fiddle with what I want to do
[18:48:21] <mr_blue> oups just updated now
[18:48:36] <superjacaman> link?
[18:49:10] <mr_blue> http://jsfiddle.net/Zuw5L/1/
[18:50:51] <superjacaman> you can set the model and the other stuff inside the function
[18:51:02] <superjacaman> or in the getJSON function
[18:52:58] <mr_blue> As you see I do a 'this.jsonData = data' inside the callback but in the console.log outside the callback jsonData is still undefined
[18:53:14] <superjacaman> outside will never work
[18:53:39] <superjacaman> they run in a diferent flow
[18:53:58] <superjacaman> the js don't wait the request end to continue the flow
[18:54:16] <superjacaman> so the request is running and the js in running
[18:54:42] <mr_blue> ok I see. Async processing
[18:54:47] <superjacaman> the console log runs before the function inside the getJSON
[18:54:53] <superjacaman> yeah exactly
[18:55:04] <mr_blue> ok ok. So abvious !
[18:55:09] <superjacaman> =]
[18:56:21] <mr_blue> thanks for your enlightments :)
[18:57:45] <superjacaman> no prob
[19:04:56] <naeluh_sat> hey when someone loads this in ff is there a line around the image ? http://jsfiddle.net/4h7GR/14/
[19:05:40] <superjacaman> the performance is a lot better
[19:06:03] <naeluh_sat> thanks !
[19:06:16] <naeluh_sat> but now in ff and ie there is a line around the image ?
[19:06:54] <superjacaman> http://min.us/i/TH6ZL6TZViz
[19:06:55] <superjacaman> ff
[19:07:32] <naeluh_sat> yeah those line dont show up in chrome but ie and ff they do
[19:07:51] <superjacaman> seems like the borders of the circle
[19:07:52] <naeluh_sat> maybe if I set stroke to 0
[19:07:59] <naeluh_sat> yeah
[19:08:13] <superjacaman> should work
[19:09:40] <naeluh_sat> nope damn
[19:15:15] <angell> hello, anyone know why .empty() doesn't work on an iframe?
[19:15:44] <superjacaman> because jquery don't work inside the iframe from the parent html
[19:15:56] <superjacaman> you need to execute inside the iframe
[19:16:36] <angell> uuhhh
[19:16:45] <angell> I'm using the iframe to capture a server json response
[19:16:57] <angell> I want to clear the iframe element after processing it
[19:17:00] <angell> using it for file upload
[19:17:32] <superjacaman> hmmm
[19:17:53] <superjacaman> i use plugin for it upclick is awesome
[19:18:39] <angell> yeah well
[19:18:43] <angell> I already wrote this
[19:18:47] <angell> and I know it can be done
[19:18:54] <angell> but I lost the link to the example I saw
[19:19:15] <angell> resetting the source to about:blank should clear it?
[19:19:39] <superjacaman> could work
[19:20:15] <superjacaman> removing and appending the iframe again is not an option ?
[19:22:53] <angell> superjacaman: that's a great idea.
[19:24:08] <GooBall> could someone give me some help the use of .offset() ?
[19:25:37] <superjacaman> GooBall: hey let's try
[19:25:45] <superjacaman> what you need?
[19:26:18] <GooBall> is there any way to make offset add to an existing css 'top' and 'left' value?
[19:26:30] <GooBall> rather then overwrite it
[19:27:16] <angell> superjacaman: thanks alot, works perfectly now
[19:27:42] <angell> superjacaman: now I don't get all the messages that I show the user if he does more than one upload
[19:28:08] <superjacaman> you can do something like parseInt($('elem').css('top')) + $('elem').position().top
[19:28:11] <shoky> GooBall: offset can take a function as argument
[19:29:09] <shoky> .offset(function(i, offset) { return {top: offset.top + 20, left: offset.top - 100}; })
[19:29:39] <shoky> er offset.left - 100
[19:35:54] <superjacaman> angell: =[
[19:36:47] <GooBall> shoky: i sort of understand that but it doesn't quite work for me :/ i've got a div positioned with top: and left: and i'm i've got it to parallax in accordance to the mouse position but whenever i move the mouse it moves the div into the top left corner
[19:36:57] <GooBall> if that makes sense :P
[19:37:28] <GooBall> $('.layer0').offset({top: + y, left: + x}); is what i'm using
[19:37:51] <shoky> + y ?
[19:38:38] <GooBall> var y = -(e.pageY + this.offsetTop) / 10;
[19:39:02] <shoky> putting that + before the y doesn't do anything
[19:39:12] <shoky> if you were expecting it to
[19:39:53] <GooBall> >.< good point
[19:40:24] <GooBall> still + aside any ideas?
[19:40:32] <shoky> yes, what i said before
[19:40:48] <shoky> but if you really want help, make a jsfiddle
[19:44:25] <heihei> I am trying to populate a text field with: this_name = "Bill"; $('#id_name').val(this_name); Which works (as in you can see the text in the field), but the value is not assigned if I inspect the element...and validation is failing.
[19:45:04] <shoky> heihei: when inspecting the element in a DOM inspector you're not supposed to see the value. it's stored in a DOM property, not as an html attribute
[19:46:11] <heihei> Hmmm. Must be something else going on then. If I type a name, form validation (via Python) works fine. If Jquery assigns the value, it fails.
[19:46:32] <shoky> doesn't sound related to jquery
[19:47:30] <shoky> setting the value programatically will not trigger any change events
[19:50:46] <GooBall> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/r5xSY/17/ one jsfiddle
[19:51:22] <shoky> why are you using this.offsetLeft ?
[19:51:46] <shoky> also, did you try my suggestion...
[19:53:00] <GooBall> what could i use in place of this.offsetLeft? and yes i did but the div just shot up and left
[19:53:24] <shoky> you answer with a question?
[19:53:48] <shoky> you could use anything you like in place of it, KSDJKGKJSDKDGJSK for example..
[19:53:59] <shoky> now will you answer mine
[19:54:22] <GooBall> because it works
[19:54:32] <shoky> does it
[19:54:41] <shoky> what do you expect "this" is?
[19:55:19] <shoky> where do you want the box to move
[19:55:35] <shoky> adding those x and y to the current offset doesn't help much
[19:55:46] <shoky> as you can see  http://jsfiddle.net/r5xSY/18/
[19:57:03] <shoky> anyway that's how you do what you asked for ^  work on your math stuff
[19:57:43] <GooBall> i need it to move in the opposite direction to the cursor
[19:58:35] <GooBall> not just to the top left
[20:00:37] <GooBall> sorry if i'm missing something obvious but jquery is not my forte
[20:05:20] <shoky> no idea if this is what you wanted  http://jsfiddle.net/r5xSY/19/
[20:05:50] <shoky> probably not, but you're too vague
[20:09:59] <GooBall> my apologies for being vague - this is the kind of thing i'm trying for http://stephband.info/jparallax/demos/index.html
[20:13:14] <liouse> I forgot the name of the type of webdesign where everything is happening via javascript instead of going to the server to display content?
[20:13:21] <liouse> basically its toggling divs etc...
[20:13:31] <liouse> is it like performant design?
[20:15:08] <GooBall> liouse: do you mean ajax?
[20:17:41] <baskwalla> Hello. Anyone ever do a diff on 2 Eloquent collections?
[20:29:45] <heihei> If I have an API call that requires authentication information, how can I store it so that it's not readable by the public?
[20:30:34] <beancurd> keep it serverside?
[20:31:14] <heihei> how would i get it from jquery?
[20:32:11] <beancurd> extrernal service requiring auth <--> your own server <--> ajax magic / client side code.

[21:13:57] <Vivekananda> what is a good way to get nth level children using jquery. This does not seem great http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13701066/jquery-getting-nth-level-children
[21:38:38] <Vivekananda> anyone here
[21:46:00] <s5fs> i'm here
[21:46:24] <heihei> How can I get the code used to mark up a text field? as in: "<input id="someID" value="hello">"  not just the value...but the actual state of the lement
[21:49:26] <Vivekananda> s5fs: hey. I pinged with this question -- what is a good way to get nth level children using jquery. This does not seem great http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13701066/jquery-getting-nth-level-children   .
[21:51:48] <s5fs> Vivekananda: what do you not like about that answer?
[21:52:09] <Vivekananda> it is too specific . I wanted a more general like nth child
[21:52:53] <s5fs> Vivekananda: does nth-child also not work for you? http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[21:54:31] <heihei> Anyone? I'd like to save the state of a text input when the page loads...that way, i can change it to a <select> if my code needs, and change it back to its original state when finished. any help?
[21:54:40] <Vivekananda> that pics up the nth child of some element but I need to pick all nth LEVEl child of some element
[21:56:58] <ftj> heihei Which attribute of the input are you using to determine if it should be changed to a select?
[21:57:33] <heihei> nothing to do with the input...if multiple results from an API call, I temporarily turn it into a select
[21:58:41] <ftj> You could store a clone of the element in a variable
[21:58:58] <ftj> var clone = $('#text_input').clone();
[21:59:08] <s5fs> Vivekananda: sorry, i don't have a solid answer off the top off my head, i just popped in for a sec while on a break :)
[21:59:26] <ftj> heihei ^
[22:00:14] <heihei> very cool, thanks
