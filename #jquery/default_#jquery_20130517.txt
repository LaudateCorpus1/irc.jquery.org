[15:14:04] <amph1bius> can you do a twitter feed without authenticating
[15:15:58] <MarkyC> Hey all I'm trying to learn the jQuery.html() function and I believe I'm coming close. I'm trying to change the text of the button when the button is clicked from hello to goodbye: http://jsfiddle.net/ppBnN/1/
[15:16:13] <quinxy> if i want to add the same button multiple times in multiple rows (like a "Delete Me" button), what's the best practice for registering the click handler and having it be able to know which id related to the content i wanted to delete?  should i put something in a value attribute then read that from a general click handler?
[15:16:21] <cablop> hello people
[15:17:18] <cablop> erm... question... if i perform animations like $("selector").hide().fadeIn() ... do the fadeIn occurs after all hide() effects were performed?
[15:26:23] <sacho> yes
[15:27:07] <cablop> but will it be executed just once... or one time per item matching selector?
[15:30:13] <cablop> what i want to do is the following:
[15:31:26] <cablop> $.when($("selector").<animationChain>).done(function() { /*...*/ });
[15:34:16] <sacho> hm
[15:34:52] <sacho> animations don't use promises I think
[15:35:53] <sacho> you'll probably want to use http://api.jquery.com/queue/ and create a promise around it
[15:39:00] <supaguest> is there a way to set this when calling a handler?
[15:39:04] <mk> Hi
[15:39:32] <sacho> supaguest, see Function.prototype.bind
[15:39:40] <mk> Anyone have any ideas to make this animation a bit cleaner...
[15:39:50] <supaguest> sacho: have I got no choice?
[15:39:52] <sacho> supaguest, oh, when calling, see apply/call
[15:39:55] <mk> lemme get the code.
[15:40:15] <sacho> supaguest, what do you mean?
[15:40:53] <supaguest> sacho: thought there was an optional argument for this for one of the event-registering methods
[15:41:01] <supaguest> *handler-registering
[15:41:53] <sacho> no
[15:41:58] <sacho> you can pass data to the handlers
[15:43:49] <mk> http://jsfiddle.net/sdFkz/
[15:43:51] <mk> Anyone have any ideas to make this animation a bit cleaner...
[15:44:32] <mk> Maybe check if near top, and start animation?
[15:46:07] <supaguest> sacho: but those still insert this as the (implicit first) argument, right?
[15:46:35] <supaguest> ie they're the "other" arguments
[15:46:54] <sacho> yes
[15:47:05] <sacho> actually the first parameter is event
[15:47:07] <sacho> the second is data
[15:47:32] <sacho> jquery's event handling mechanism sets this to be the element that is currently firing the event
[15:47:47] <supaguest> sacho: hmm... what is this then?
[15:47:56] <supaguest> oh
[15:48:06] <sacho> you can get around it by using bind
[15:48:13] <sacho> ..that's pretty much all there is to it
[15:48:41] <supaguest> sacho: won't function(){obj.method();} suffice?
[15:49:09] <supaguest> (given that i want obj to be this, and nothing custom)?
[15:51:10] <supaguest> sacho: seems not. eh... javascript. ok, thanks for the suggestion, will use.
[15:54:22] <mk> i'm surethisa been done before
[15:54:56] <MarkyC> Hey all I'm trying to learn the jQuery.html() function and I believe I'm coming close. I'm trying to change the text of the button when the button is clicked from hello to goodbye: http://jsfiddle.net/ppBnN/1/
[15:55:09] <sacho> supaguest, depends
[15:59:24] <mk> MarkyC, Do you want to use .html()?
[16:03:12] <mk> http://jsfiddle.net/ppBnN/2/
[16:03:18] <mk> MarkyC,
[16:10:12] <MarkyC> mk: Yes, that's precisely what I was looking for
[16:10:15] <MarkyC> thank you

[17:26:57] <guideX> any idea why fancybox only shows once per page load? so if I click for a 2nd fancy box on the page, it doesn't show
[17:29:08] <thujone> you're not binding it properly?
[17:29:30] <guideX> ah ok
[17:29:37] <thujone> i don't know
[17:29:44] <thujone> i've used multiple fancyboxes on one page
[17:29:50] <guideX> i'm doing it like this .. $('.vehicle_model').fancybox();
[17:29:51] <thujone> but i bound each one separately
[17:29:54] <guideX> ah ok
[17:29:59] <guideX> I thought it was something like that
[17:30:13] <guideX> I must each right
[17:30:27] <thujone> maybe you have a bug that's destroying the others when you close the first
[17:30:46] <guideX> hmm maybe
[17:31:33] <guideX> ah there is a problem in my console when the fancy box comes up, thanks
[17:31:53] <thujone> nice
[17:56:19] <joshsmith> hey all, I have two inputs, one for a url and one for a title. when a user inputs a url, I briefly disable the title input, fill it with the title returned from hitting that page, and then remove the disabled attr
[17:56:26] <joshsmith> however, I can no longer paste content into that input
[17:56:29] <joshsmith> even though I can edit it
[17:59:48] <cablop> joshmith weird... how are you pasting the code? try using keyb and mouse methods and tell us what happens
[18:00:29] <joshsmith> cablop: I'll be back in like an hour
[18:00:31] <joshsmith> bad time to post this
[18:00:36] <joshsmith> I'll do a jsfiddle to show you what I mean
[18:00:45] <joshsmith> never encountered that issue before
[18:01:00] <cablop> it's weird
[18:01:42] <cablop> my first idea is that probably when you are pasting you are losing the focus of the object disabling it, but it depends on your code
[18:02:18] <cablop> * ... losing the focus of the object, causing it being disabled, but it depends....
[18:03:26] <snagnever> amph1bius: thanks a lot for your help earlier
[18:12:39] <JohnnyCache> <tr onclick='add(this)'>

[18:13:13] <JohnnyCache> has no method 'closest'
[18:13:13] <JohnnyCache> ??
[18:13:26] <JohnnyCache> what am i doing wrong here?
[18:16:22] <lenswipee> JohnnyCache: try add($this)

[18:17:45] <lenswipee> JohnnyCache: Gotta run. Bye
[18:17:51] <JohnnyCache> thanks, bye
[18:18:23] <JohnnyCache> argh i dont get it
[18:20:52] <guideX> ah .. I had a fancybox js included in the fancybox popup
[18:23:19] <hugo_moss> whats a good plugin for beautifully styled alerts out of the box
[18:26:24] <hugo_moss> if theres anything better than fancybox or jqueryui dialog
[18:48:20] <relipse2> Eviltwin: wasnt sure of the scope
[19:12:44] <w00ble> Ugh, I hate javascript right now
[19:14:40] <c4ptnh00k2> why?
[19:14:45] <w00ble> I dont see why people think its funny to ruin my reputation by downvoting the simplest questions. Dont they know who they're dealing with? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5638513/selecting-from-a-dropdown-by-text-value
[19:15:53] <w00ble> I mean, what could be clearer really. damn jerks
[19:16:46] <w00ble> i'm so angry right now. What's wrong with these frontend guys?
[19:18:57] <c4ptnh00k2> ... maybe you could use less "humorous" variable name? i dunno or just ask in chat first lol
[19:19:18] <w00ble> That's totally irrelevant
[19:19:56] <w00ble> I don't ever have issues like this when I deal with perl or python questions
[19:20:30] <w00ble> The backend communities seem way more respectful
[19:22:17] <c4ptnh00k2> um ok then go no reason to get huffy over a downvote for an easily googled question
[19:24:39] <w00ble> That's not the point! I couldn't find a clear answer to this so I was hoping to ask on stack. I did google it thank you very much
[19:26:43] <c4ptnh00k2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/241727/how-do-i-select-an-item-by-its-text-value-in-a-dropdown-using-jquery
[19:27:14] <c4ptnh00k2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4757198/jquery-how-to-select-dropdown-list-item-by-text
[19:27:26] <w00ble> You know what, screw you JS guys. This is bullshit
[19:27:43] <c4ptnh00k2> i just copied and pasted your exact question into google.
[19:28:29] <c4ptnh00k2> dont get mad because you didnt search before you asked and you were called out on it
[19:28:45] <w00ble> I just wanted to get a clearer answer
[19:30:12] <c4ptnh00k2> then next time state that. I come from orig embedded c and Ill tell you they are worse.
[19:31:02] <w00ble> i'm done here
[20:01:40] <madprops> anybody else gets a menu when right clicking the refresh button in chromium?
[20:16:21] <ashfogel> hello everybody : ) . I have a problem with a jquery function that is occurring only on Firefox, and no other browser. I am attempting to dynamically adjust some opacity values based on the addition/removal of classes ("checked") to checkboxes. think it is simply an oversight on my behalf... but it looks like Firefox responds to the hasClass() method in the opposite way to other browsers.  It's driving me mad and if anyone has a mom
[20:47:11] <joshsmith> cablop: still around?
[21:05:10] <joshsmith> is anyone around? running into a pretty funky issue
[21:05:37] <silentpost> ayup
[21:05:49] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/
[21:05:56] <joshsmith> type something into the URL input
[21:06:01] <joshsmith> then blur
[21:06:10] <joshsmith> then try and paste a string into the title input
[21:06:36] <joshsmith> I've narrowed it down to being something about that particular HTML
[21:07:45] <joshsmith> because if you replaced all that HTML with two simple inputs of the same ids, the issue doesn't occur
[21:08:17] <silentpost> weird
[21:08:42] <joshsmith> yeah, I don't get it
[21:09:28] <joshsmith> I've narrowed it further
[21:09:28] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/1/
[21:09:46] <joshsmith> something about that particular HTML
[21:13:24] <joshsmith> type="text"
[21:13:31] <joshsmith> if I remove type="text"
[21:13:38] <joshsmith> it becomes paste-able again
[21:22:26] <chee> joshsmith: <input size="30" type="text">
[21:22:33] <chee> http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/3/
[21:23:01] <joshsmith> wow what
[21:24:24] <chee> lol wat
[21:24:29] <chee> joshsmith: even this does it: <input type="text" size>
[21:24:36] <joshsmith> man...
[21:24:47] <joshsmith> I've isolated it to my css now, at least
[21:30:11] <joshsmith> * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; }
[21:30:15] <joshsmith> that is throwing it off somehow
[21:32:22] <joshsmith> if I remove that, it works again
[21:32:39] <chee> paul_irish has a lot to answer for
[21:33:07] <joshsmith> this seems really obscure
[21:33:27] <joshsmith> I don't know why that would affect it
[21:33:56] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/9/
[21:34:35] <silentpost> it's because of the padding in conjunction with the border-box
[21:34:59] <silentpost> def a weird bug
[21:35:09] <silentpost> turn on border-box and disable that padding and it should work as well
[21:35:12] <gx_> Hi guys, can anyone help me out with this? http://pastebin.ca/2377616   I'm trying to get the actual key *name* from a json object, not an integer
[21:36:40] <silentpost> !pastebin
[21:36:41] <joshsmith> silentpost: how did you debug that?
[21:36:59] <silentpost> dev tools
[21:36:59] <joshsmith> and how would I go about achieving the same effect of the padding without it?
[21:37:12] <chee> are we all using the same browser?
[21:37:17] <silentpost> chrome
[21:37:43] <toothr> gx_, what kind of keys do you expect from an array?
[21:37:54] <joshsmith> oh you mean, you just unticked things in dev tools
[21:37:58] <joshsmith> I should've done that.
[21:38:09] <toothrot> those are indexes
[21:40:10] <gx_> toothr that's what i'm slightly confused about. i want to loop through each name/value pair and get the name of each of them, such as "label", "colheading", "datatype"
[21:40:53] <gx_> toothrot and yeah i get now that it's an array
[21:41:28] <gx_> and the "val" contains an object with name/value pairs. but if i loop through the "val" object, it still just gives me indexes, and not the key name
[21:41:52] <joshsmith> silentpost: should I just use height + line-height to achieve the same?
[21:42:10] <silentpost> @joshsmith: you could set the input box-sizing to content-box and still set it with padding
[21:42:15] <silentpost> i don't know if that's the best solution
[21:42:27] <silentpost> but i'm playing with it now and it seems to work. I'll post in a sec
[21:43:14] <joshsmith> yeah, looks to work
[21:43:16] <silentpost> @joshsmith: http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/3/
[21:44:50] <gx_> toothrot so for example, if i do console.log(val.label) within that .each(), it gives me the *value* of the "label". but what i want to do is be able to get the name, and value of every pair. i can't figure out how to actually get the string "label"
[21:45:31] <joshsmith> silentpost: wrong link?
[21:46:16] <silentpost> @joshsmith: oops. http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/11/
[21:46:42] <joshsmith> any reason for the !important on that or just to override the other css?
[21:46:58] <silentpost> yeah it was just to override your css
[21:47:09] <joshsmith> also, any idea on why that's happening? I'd like to understand what the deal with that is
[21:48:14] <joshsmith> should I submit this as a webkit bug, maybe?
[21:48:31] <joshsmith> supposedly pasting worked fine in IE
[21:49:14] <chee> joshsmith: you probably should
[21:49:24] <chee> and i've just had a look
[21:49:29] <chee> and it also works again
[21:49:35] <chee> if you get rid of 'font-size: 1em'
[21:49:56] <chee> and if you get rid of height: 20px;
[21:50:00] <chee> hang on a tick
[21:50:53] <chee> there
[21:50:59] <chee> joshsmith: here is the most reduced you can make it
[21:51:00] <chee> http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/12/
[21:51:14] <chee> <input size>
[21:51:35] <chee> and those rules
[21:51:47] <toothrot> gx_, `for property in obj:` (although this will include inherited properties too, only you know if that will be an issue. there are workarounds.)
[21:52:16] <joshsmith> chee: that one's working for me
[21:52:29] <silentpost> me too
[21:52:30] <toothrot> gx_, but actually each should work the way you want
[21:52:37] <chee> wat?
[21:52:39] <toothrot> gx_, so i would take a closer look at your data
[21:52:44] <chee> it doesn't work for me. but here's what i do
[21:52:48] <chee> type some text
[21:52:51] <chee> then select all
[21:52:53] <chee> cut, paste
[21:53:04] <gx_> toothrot when i console.log(val) it gives me: Object {label: "Employee Group Member ID", colheading: "Employee Group Member ID", data_type: "INTEGER", length: "4", ordinal_position: "1"}
[21:53:07] <joshsmith> yeah, working on that one
[21:53:16] <chee> vdfvdfklvm C-a C-x C-v
[21:53:19] <chee> joshsmith: rly!
[21:53:23] <chee> it doesn't work for me
[21:53:28] <chee> odd
[21:53:36] <joshsmith> yeah, this is like input inception
[21:53:40] <joshsmith> I think I'm too deep now
[21:53:52] <gx_> toothrot but when i do $.each(val as (key, val) { console.log(key) }); , it still gives me indexes, and not the "name"
[21:53:54] <joshsmith> also, drinking while doing this is either a bad or a great idea
[21:54:05] <joshsmith> …and I have friends over...
[21:54:12] <chee> i can't believe that one works for you
[21:54:17] <chee> no fair
[21:54:20] <chee> my chrome is a dick
[21:54:39] <joshsmith> what chrome?
[21:54:52] <joshsmith> I'm 26.0.1410.65
[21:54:58] <chee> Version 28.0.1500.4 dev
[21:55:15] <chee> i'm on chromeos even
[21:56:27] <gx_> toothrot sorry that was poor syntax above, but you get the idea
[21:58:08] <silentpost> chee: that's weird. i just tried it on canary and it worked fine too (v. 29)
[21:58:15] <chee> wat
[21:58:24] <silentpost> haha
[21:59:52] <joshsmith> chee I found the difference
[22:00:04] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/14/
[22:00:07] <joshsmith> line-height
[22:00:10] <toothrot> gx_, $.each({label: "Employee Group Member ID", colheading: "Employee Group Member ID", data_type: "INTEGER", length: "4", ordinal_position: "1"}, function(k,v) {console.log(k);})
[22:01:14] <joshsmith> actually
[22:01:15] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/16/
[22:01:19] <joshsmith> that's the most reduced I can make it
[22:01:54] <gx_> toothrot that gives me 0,1,2,3
[22:02:00] <chee> joshsmith: what about this: http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/18/
[22:02:15] <joshsmith> yes
[22:02:54] <joshsmith> actually if we want to get really pedantic
[22:02:55] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/MUeAb/19/
[22:03:14] <gx_> toothrot and if i do console.log(v); it gives undefined. so basically it's malformed json somehow?
[22:03:14] <chee> joshsmith: wtf
[22:03:25] <chee> joshsmith: but ages ago, when we started this nightmare circus
[22:03:31] <joshsmith> no I mean, it's not working
[22:03:32] <chee> if i removed size it works
[22:03:34] <joshsmith> for me
[22:03:34] <chee> *worked
[22:03:49] <chee> joshsmith: ya, i understand! it's not working for me either
[22:03:51] <joshsmith> I changed it to content-box and changed the padding
[22:03:58] <chee> but i'm sure it did, back in the day, when i removed size
[22:04:03] <joshsmith> so should I submit this to webkit? or something else?
[22:04:26] <joshsmith> I feel lost
[22:04:45] <chee> joshsmith: well, i guess if it's still happening to me it's Blink's problem now
[22:04:54] <chee> joshsmith: can you test on safari?
[22:05:10] <joshsmith> yeah one sec
[22:05:45] <joshsmith> yep, also happening on safari
[22:06:28] <joshsmith> gonna try via browserstack on IE8
[22:07:49] <joshsmith> working fine on IE9
[22:07:58] <chee> firefox?
[22:08:07] <chee> i mean it's looking like webkit bug now
[22:08:33] <joshsmith> yep, firefox is fine
[22:08:39] <joshsmith> okay, I'll submit to webkit
[22:12:08] <chee> joshsmith: it's still broken for me even if i remove line-height
[22:12:28] <gx_> toothrot: I got it! for (var key in val) { if (val.hasOwnProperty(key)) { console.log(key); } }
[22:12:40] <chee> it is broken if the padding is 'padding: 8px', and fixed if the padding is 'padding: 7px;'
[22:13:29] <chee> for me anyway
[22:13:36] <chee> very odd
[22:13:47] <joshsmith> very very strange
[22:16:05] <joshsmith> okay maybe add a comment chee? https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116385
[22:16:17] <joshsmith> my first webkit bug
[22:17:46] <chee> drunk out of your mind submitting bugs to vendors
[22:19:38] <joshsmith> the beer I just drank is called Even More Jesus
[22:19:55] <joshsmith> I feel like the webkit team won't appreciate that
[22:21:30] <joshsmith> btw, chee, this was a bug for a weekend hack
[22:21:35] <joshsmith> tell me what you think: http://lifestyle.io/
[22:21:56] <joshsmith> my first responsive design, actually
[22:22:42] <chee> very nice : ) !
[22:24:37] <joshsmith> thanks
[22:24:42] <joshsmith> any thoughts on improvements?
[22:26:54] <silentpost> is this scraping from HN?
[22:28:16] <silentpost> or. nope
[22:30:23] <joshsmith> haha no
[22:31:01] <joshsmith> I see people on HN frequently complaining that a lot of the startup-y stuff is about venture-backed nonsense
[22:31:18] <joshsmith> whereas a lot of us want to see more patio11, 37s, etc etc
[22:31:47] <joshsmith> so I'm gonna try to round up some people in that community and see if we can't get a good thing going
[22:31:49] <joshsmith> if not, no sweat
[22:32:04] <silentpost> gotcha
[22:32:22] <joshsmith> reactions? advice?
[22:33:56] <silentpost> i like the idea--it's always cool to read about the small guys (me, us) making it through persistence
[22:34:13] <silentpost> site looks sharp too
[22:34:58] <joshsmith> thanks, it should look good on mobile as well, which was a priority for me
[22:35:08] <joshsmith> and yeah, I'd love to see more of that kind of content
[22:35:14] <joshsmith> have other ideas for it, too
[22:35:21] <joshsmith> like anonymous discussions
[22:35:42] <joshsmith> so you can talk about issues you're having consulting or whatever you're doing to bootstrap
[22:35:53] <joshsmith> or a place to share/upvote tools
[22:36:15] <joshsmith> I'm always curious what people are using for things as varied as billing, marketing, seo, etc.
[22:36:36] <joshsmith> but really this is make or break depending on whether I can get a good core set of users into it
[22:36:52] <joshsmith> like any ugc-type thing, ofc
[22:37:04] <silentpost> yup yup
[22:46:32] <chee> joshsmith: cool
[23:15:48] <c4ptnh00k2> sup
