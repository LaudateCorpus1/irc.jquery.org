[01:33:51] <Cork> Zak: you can depend on that it will always be the version number
[01:34:03] <Cork> Zak: if it is a string or not shouldn't matter
[01:38:07] <Mark__> can anyone take a look at this page and tellme why the slider isn’t functioning?it’s a owlslider http://1566-4609.com/xe/index
[02:46:45] <hellyeah> yo
[02:46:47] <hellyeah> is it possible to remove html element from dom totally like removing the connection of child element with its parent?
[02:57:43] <Kartagis> $elem.remove()
[02:58:34] <hellyeah> Kartagis:how is it goingf?
[02:58:55] <Kartagis> not bad
[02:59:00] <Kartagis> you?
[02:59:18] <hellyeah> could be better
[02:59:36] <hellyeah> my manager ask mne to do advanced stuff as the day pass by

[03:17:10] <droid909> JamesArlen: is that a check if there are OPs in this chan? :)
[03:17:17] <JamesArlen> yes :)
[03:17:26] <JamesArlen> no OPs party time!
[03:17:27] <JamesArlen> =D\
[03:17:35] <JamesArlen> 8=============================================================================================================================D
[03:17:38] <JamesArlen> ^actual size
[03:18:28] <hellyeah> this channel is logged xD
[03:18:40] <JamesArlen> they don't read logs
[03:18:51] <JamesArlen> and if so they have to catch you in the act not after the fact
[03:18:52] <hellyeah> hehehe,
[03:18:56] <hellyeah> party on then
[03:18:58] <hellyeah> MUAHA
[03:19:11] <hellyeah> well
[03:19:13] <Waldi_> lold
[03:19:25] <hellyeah> you know how to jeopartize the system
[03:19:28] <hellyeah> xD
[03:19:33] <JamesArlen> what should we do
[03:19:58] <droid909> JamesArlen: you are the inventor of niggercheck method
[03:20:14] <JamesArlen> am i?
[03:20:21] <JamesArlen> i feel honored to have invented something
[03:20:23] <JamesArlen> you see
[03:20:25] <hellyeah> hahahaha
[03:20:29] <JamesArlen> my life has been worthless until this point
[03:20:35] <JamesArlen> i actually contributed to something
[03:20:40] <hellyeah> trolling vs trolling
[03:20:40] <JamesArlen> i have actually invented
[03:20:42] <hellyeah> xD
[03:20:46] <JamesArlen> something useful
[03:20:51] <JamesArlen> i feel very proud of myself
[03:20:59] <JamesArlen> i should do more great things for humanity
[03:21:13] <droid909> JamesArlen: like ... code in jquery ;)
[03:21:24] <JamesArlen> that's a given
[03:21:34] <JamesArlen> but coding in vanilla js is better
[03:21:47] <hellyeah> why is better?
[03:21:53] <JamesArlen> more loc
[03:21:55] <JamesArlen> more control
[03:22:00] <JamesArlen> or conTROLL
[03:22:04] <hellyeah> control over wat?
[03:22:12] <JamesArlen> youru code
[03:22:14] <JamesArlen> your*
[03:22:34] <JamesArlen> you can see what is happening
[03:22:37] <JamesArlen> in and out
[03:22:55] <JamesArlen> in jquery you have to read the entire library and its code in order to figure out why it works the way it does
[03:23:06] <JamesArlen> but jquery is shorter to write
[03:23:07] <droid909> JamesArlen: well, jquery is written in vanilla js
[03:23:22] <droid909> JamesArlen: so you somewhat still code in vanilla js ;P
[03:23:23] <hellyeah> hmm vanilla.js
[03:23:34] <hellyeah> should i learn it?
[03:23:42] <hellyeah> i know javascript and jquery both
[03:23:56] <robhol> ....
[03:24:23] <robhol> 1) no you don't  2) vanilla just means javascript without any libraries
[03:24:23] <JamesArlen> yea
[03:24:26] <hellyeah> robhol: did i say smt wrong?
[03:24:26] <JamesArlen> learn it and leet me know
[03:24:44] <JamesArlen> but you should learn iamaretard.js first
[03:24:48] <hellyeah> robhol: is it just plain js?
[03:24:59] <robhol> yes
[03:25:01] <droid909> hellyeah: airplain js
[03:25:18] <hellyeah> robhol: of course i dont know but i learnt some stuff :D
[03:25:38] <droid909> hellyeah: because we can just plain live without air
[03:26:29] <droid909> can't
[03:27:35] <hellyeah> actualy
[03:27:39] <hellyeah> i want to learn d3.js
[03:28:40] <droid909> or eminem's d12.js
[03:28:52] <droid909> ok i stop
[03:28:56] * droid909 goes to sleep
[03:30:12] <hellyeah> droid909:let me ask a question
[03:30:24] <hellyeah> do you know replace state and push state
[03:31:41] <droid909> hellyeah: replaceState() will change the URL in the browser
[03:31:53] <droid909> hellyeah: pushState() will change the URL, and keep the old one in the browser history
[03:32:29] <droid909> hellyeah: replace won't keep the history, i.e. u won't be able to press back button
[03:33:25] <hellyeah> well what i need is pushState() it seems
[03:33:44] <hellyeah> like when you call page and you create some div and you close the page
[03:34:04] <hellyeah> and you call same page again, i want to see div that i created
[03:34:25] <hellyeah> so pushState() will bring me the url in the browser history right
[03:34:40] <hellyeah> is that smt like that?
[03:34:50] <hellyeah> sorry for my english it is limited.
[03:38:20] <droid909> hellyeah: try it and see, best way to actualy memorise what you've just learnt
[03:39:07] <d3m0n> Can someone tell me how I can seperate the spec_val var to each it's own object? http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/dYBOeK?editors=101
[04:52:33] <EugenA> there is 'change' event (checkbox) which replaces whole form. I need to modify some element on new html. The problem is - my change happens before html get replaced
[04:52:53] <EugenA> I do my change after ajax
[04:55:24] <PokerGod> i have an array and i want to change it to an array of objects.  [{'data': ...},{'data': .. }], any ideas?
[04:56:30] <Cork> EugenA: you would have to get access to the xhr object
[04:56:56] <Cork> PokerGod: you mean you want to get [{'data': ...},{'data': .. }] ?
[04:57:04] <Cork> cause that is an array of objects
[04:57:18] <Cork> or do you mean you have unparsed json?
[04:57:21] <EugenA> Cork: do you think $(document).ajaxComplete() would help me?
[04:57:35] <Cork> EugenA: it might
[04:57:57] <Cork> though you don't know what ajax call triggered it
[04:58:41] <PokerGod> Cork, take .. ['one','two','three'] and turn it into ..  [{'data':'one'},{'data':'two'},{'data':'three'}]
[04:59:15] <Cork> PokerGod: $.map(arr, function(v) { return { data: v }; })
[05:01:48] <PokerGod> brilliant, thanks
[05:42:24] <sdfdssdf> hi, I have three input tags with one class name testing, I am trying to get value of first text box
[05:46:35] <Uhkis> sdfdssdf: $('.yourclass').get(0).val();
[05:47:13] <sdfdssdf> "Object doesn't support this property or method"
[05:47:31] <sdfdssdf> Uhkis: that is what i got
[05:53:10] <sdfdssdf> anyone?
[05:53:17] <Uhkis> sdfdssdf: make a fiddle
[05:53:44] <sdfdssdf> it is in asp.net combined with jquery running in IE
[05:53:59] <d3m0n> sdfdssdf Try eq()
[05:54:13] <d3m0n> $('.yourclass').eq(0).val();
[05:55:25] <sdfdssdf> getting ""
[05:55:31] <sdfdssdf> which means it is reading blank value now
[05:55:31] <Uhkis> sdfdssdf: make a fiddle.
[05:55:45] <d3m0n> sdfdssdf: means you dont have anything in that input or the selector is wrong
[05:57:17] <sdfdssdf> d3m0n:  it is asp text box
[05:57:37] <sdfdssdf> Ukhis: How am i supposed to make fiddle
[05:57:37] <sdfdssdf> when it is asp text box
[05:57:55] <Uhkis> your thing doesn't generate html?

[06:07:07] <Matt____> Hey there
[06:07:12] <Matt____> can anyone help me with a small issue
[06:07:34] <Matt____> i need to match two values but value A is (re: Test) value B is (Test)
[06:07:39] <Matt____> and that is a good match
[06:07:48] <Matt____> but say
[06:07:51] <Cork> Matt____: so a regex match
[06:08:11] <Cork> is it two string? "(re: Test)" and "(Test)" or what?
[06:08:13] <Matt____> not very good with regex
[06:08:18] <Matt____> check here cork http://jsfiddle.net/master412160/tta01v8m/
[06:08:35] <Cork> ah
[06:08:45] <Cork> Matt____: that should be fairly simple
[06:08:47] <Matt____> lacks the final touch
[06:08:58] <Matt____> yeah I guess so
[06:09:12] <Matt____> but I'm not seeing the final key
[06:10:27] <Cork> Matt____: well there are a few ways to handle that
[06:10:43] <Matt____> alright which is the easiest
[06:10:48] <Cork> firstly you could just match on if the first title matches the end of the other
[06:10:57] <Matt____> ah ah
[06:11:10] <Matt____> that seems a nice idea
[06:11:13] <Cork> but would give false positives with "making a test" matching "test"
[06:11:23] <Matt____> yeah
[06:11:30] <Matt____> but the subject and title
[06:11:33] <Matt____> change per topic
[06:11:36] <Matt____> so if someone writes
[06:11:39] <Matt____> Hello I'm Max
[06:11:42] <Matt____> then the subejct will be
[06:11:45] <Cork> you could strip out leading "Re:", but that would give false negatives when the mail comes from other languages
[06:11:45] <Matt____> Re: Hello I'm Max
[06:11:54] <Matt____> oh that is fine
[06:11:56] <Matt____> its for phpbb
[06:12:09] <Matt____> strip out re just for the filtering
[06:12:19] <Matt____> but keep it visible you know
[06:12:25] <Matt____> that could work
[06:12:26] <Cork> well you could do .replace(/Re:/g, '')
[06:12:33] <Cork> actually .replace(/Re: /g, '')
[06:12:46] <Matt____> this will remove it?
[06:12:52] <Cork> ya
[06:13:10] <Matt____> but what if I want to keep it there
[06:13:26] <Matt____> its meant for replying
[06:13:31] <Cork> Matt____: also the else if is pointless
[06:13:39] <Matt____> well not really
[06:13:45] <Matt____> the else if is reserved for a function I want to run
[06:13:52] <Matt____> when the subject and title don't match
[06:14:04] <Cork> ya, that is ALWAYS the else case
[06:14:09] <Matt____> ok
[06:14:12] <Matt____> will change that
[06:14:17] <Cork> as your if case is the reverse of the earlier if case
[06:14:30] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/tta01v8m/2/
[06:14:57] <Matt____> great
[06:15:23] <Mark__> um,
[06:15:24] <Cork> if you just want to support "Re: " at the beginning of the line use https://jsfiddle.net/tta01v8m/4/
[06:15:43] <Mark__> is there anyway i can select dynamically added elements?
[06:16:01] <Cork> Mark__: there are no difference, so ya
[06:16:07] <Matt____> cause RE is always at the start in this case
[06:16:14] <Mark__> what do you mean there’s no difference?
[06:16:23] <Cork> Matt____: ya, but you might get Re: Re: test
[06:16:30] <Cork> Matt____: /4/ handles that though
[06:16:35] <Mark__> im adding another js plugin into my website,
[06:16:45] <Mark__> and it’s not working , because i use ajax call for the contents.
[06:16:55] <Mark__> so the contents must be addressed differently.
[06:16:58] <Cork> Mark__: you can't select an element before it exists
[06:16:59] <Mark__> but i do not know how.
[06:17:03] <Mark__> right.
[06:17:08] <Mark__> but how do i select afterwards?
[06:17:18] <Cork> so you have to initialize the plugin after the ajax has completed
[06:17:23] <Mark__> hmm
[06:17:27] <Cork> so in the .done callback
[06:17:31] <Mark__> sec.
[06:18:38] <Matt____> thank you Cork will use that last one
[06:19:18] <Mark__> i have no clue how to add that code in my codes. http://jsfiddle.net/40Ltz3qd/
[06:19:22] <Mark__> *into
[06:19:32] <Mark__> cause i MUST use onclick function
[06:19:54] <Cork> Mark__: you have to replace the .ready with the callback from your ajax callback
[06:20:06] <Cork> uh... from your ajax call
[06:20:10] <Mark__> oh.. now it’s getting difficult.
[06:20:45] <Cork> ya, if you don't it will run before the element exists
[06:21:05] <Mark__> can you be more specific , possibly with some examples please?
[06:21:13] <Mark__> and i have another question to add,
[06:21:16] <Cork> uh
[06:21:38] <Mark__> what kind of code should i use in order to add preloader that disappears after the ajax call is completed
[06:21:42] <Cork> yourAjaxCall.done(function() { $('.read_number').animateNumber(...); });
[06:21:46] <Mark__> i might have asked this question yesterday but
[06:21:48] <Mark__> give it a go.
[06:22:08] <Mark__> that’s not what you said earlier though, that looks plain simple
[06:22:19] <Cork> Mark__: well it is psudo code
[06:22:31] <Cork> as i don't know what makes your ajax calls
[06:22:35] <Mark__> hmm...
[06:23:00] <Cork> btw $oDocument->get() is not valid js
[06:23:11] <Mark__> it’s from my CMS
[06:23:13] <Mark__> so it works.
[06:23:56] <Mark__> so is this it? load.done(function() { jQuery('.read_number').animateNumber(123}); });
[06:24:00] <Mark__> it can’t be lol
[06:24:38] <Cork> if you store the jqxhr object in a variable load, then ya that would work
[06:27:56] <Mark__> could you help me with the preloader that appears until the ajax code is complete?
[06:28:02] <Mark__> it should be easier than this.
[06:28:11] <Mark__> and yet i cannot find any right cod.
[06:28:13] <Mark__> lol...
[06:29:51] <Cork> Mark__: well you could either just add static data in the page and have the new content just replace it
[06:30:00] <Cork> or... you need the callbacks again
[06:30:58] <Mark__> ...
[06:33:04] <sdfdssdf> https://jsfiddle.net/ytt5gr0j/
[06:33:06] <sdfdssdf> why no alert
[06:37:12] <Cork> sdfdssdf: never ever ever use event attributes
[06:37:44] <sdfdssdf> fixed it just now
[06:37:51] <skynxnex> and it doesnt work on jsfiddle if you have onLoad, it works with no wrap
[06:37:52] <Cork> sdfdssdf: event attributes has no support for function scopes, so all functions have to be declared globals
[06:38:11] <Cork> skynxnex: it doesn't work unless the function becomes a global name
[06:38:16] <Cork> and that is a really bad idea
[06:38:53] <sdfdssdf> my asp.net control's class name gets removed as soon as i type something in it
[06:38:54] <sdfdssdf> don't know why
[06:40:06] <Mark__> well in mycase i must use onclick
[06:40:26] <Mark__> as jquery or ajax cannot recieve data from my CMS
[06:40:33] <Mark__> but i don’t know how it all woks.
[07:26:21] <sim642> I'm trying to use $.get to get an URL but it's returning no data. The URL works just fine when I manually check it
[07:26:39] <Cork> sim642: same domain as the site?
[07:27:31] <sim642> not exactly
[07:27:34] <Cork> meaning are you making the $.get request against the same domain the page is fetched from
[07:27:43] <Cork> then cors will block the data
[07:27:50] <Cork> (a browser security feature)
[07:28:17] <sim642> I used to do this all the time, damnit
[07:28:23] <sim642> now I can't even make API calls...
[07:28:33] <Cork> check the browsers console
[07:29:10] <sim642> I did, it just shows the request being made but no data returned, no error anywhere I can see
[07:29:24] <Cork> and the response has the data?
[07:29:30] <Cork> (in the browser console)
[07:29:42] <sim642> no, it's empty but it has response headers and everything else and shows up as if it worked
[07:29:59] <Cork> uh
[07:30:08] <sim642> just that it's size is 0kB
[07:30:10] <Cork> i mean if you check the http request in the browsers network tab
[07:30:17] <Cork> well then the api didn't give you any data
[07:30:26] <Cork> so not a js problem
[07:30:34] <sim642> it does give me data when I check the exact url into the address bar
[07:31:05] <Cork> make a jsfiddle with the code you have
[07:33:55] <sim642> there is barely anything to look at: https://jsfiddle.net/sim642/8sonhs80/
[07:35:27] <Cork> sim642: you should get a "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://tartu.peatus.ee/estonia/stops.txt. (Reason: CORS request failed)." warning in your console (wording differ based on browser)
[07:36:00] <Cork> sim642: and the server have to allow it for it to work
[07:36:53] <sim642> so I have to run my own proxy server just to use some API?
[07:37:17] <Cork> well you have to use your own proxy to prevent YOU from abusing the visitors cookie store ya
[07:37:44] <Cork> sim642: javascript makes http requests as that user, not as the site
[07:38:00] <Cork> so you get access based on there cookies
[07:38:23] <Cork> and that is why cors is blocked unless the server explicitly say it can handle it
[07:38:44] <hellyeah> yo
[07:39:10] <sim642> Cork, would've never thought getting a text file becomes an impossible task
[07:39:22] <Cork> sim642: it isn't impossible
[07:39:34] <hellyeah> you can drag and drop object but i took an error "d is not defined" when you move object. How can i solve the issue? Can you help? https://jsfiddle.net/c0wm2nxt/1/
[07:39:35] <Cork> either the server have to implement a safe api
[07:39:42] <Cork> or you have to provide it in a safe manner
[07:39:59] <Cork> sim642: it could be a simple one liner .php file on your server
[07:40:41] <sim642> Cork, completely defeats the point of ajax then if I have to provide everything from my own server
[07:40:43] <Cork> (but be careful so you don't open your self up towards the same problem)
[07:40:47] <sim642> just makes the whole thing shadier if you ask me
[07:41:07] <Cork> sim642: well if the provider provided an api for it it would just work
[07:41:18] <taplar> hellyeah: your not giving the event to the outer handler
[07:41:20] <Cork> the problem is that your trying to abuse there server
[07:41:22] <sim642> it's not even an API, it's simply public data
[07:41:36] <Cork> ya, but public data != safe web api
[07:41:49] <hellyeah> yes
[07:41:50] <sim642> nor is it abuse
[07:41:55] <hellyeah> thanks taplar
[07:42:08] <Cork> sim642: it is when your trying to load things from another server as an api when it isn't
[07:42:18] <taplar> hellyeah: btw, do you realize your rebinding on every mouse down?
[07:42:35] <hellyeah> taplar: no :po
[07:42:48] <Cork> sim642: you put load on there servers for your sites gain without them having a way to point the load reason back at you
[07:42:53] <sim642> Cork, so I have to store my own copies of the publically available data only with the additional risk of it being outdated
[07:42:57] <taplar> yeah, not a good thing to do
[07:43:06] <Cork> sim642: that is one solution ya
[07:43:12] <Cork> or like i said you could just proxy the call
[07:43:16] <hellyeah> taplar: what should i do?
[07:43:50] <Cork> sim642: but you can't make the call directly to there server from the browser, the webs security model doesn't allow it
[07:44:08] <sim642> Cork, my personal use script is not likely to put huge load on a server which publically provides a much greater service with tens of thousands of users downloading it every day
[07:44:11] <Cork> (you could contact them and ask them to open it up)
[07:44:38] <hellyeah> taplar: but i can drag and drop button many times. Do i need to bind it whenever i drag and drop button?
[07:44:43] <Cork> sim642: user script has access to a cors independent ajax call
[07:44:46] <Cork> just use that
[08:17:57] <sigdk> hello, shouldn't the one-two-three appear in different tabs here: http://jsfiddle.net/d3p1vhaw/6/ ?
[08:25:54] <xec> sigdk: there's no jquery in that demo?
[08:26:06] <Cork> sigdk: that would be a bootstrap question not a jquery one
[08:26:31] <Cork> so => ##bootstrap
[08:26:51] <sigdk> good, thanks
[08:30:12] <xec> sigdk: fixd. http://jsfiddle.net/d3p1vhaw/8/
[08:30:42] * xec drops mic and walks away
[08:31:26] <sigdk> xec, that's very nice but how does it work ?
[08:31:44] <xec> first it saves all tabs in a var and hides them (line 1)
[08:32:18] <sigdk> my code currently has something like: $(document).ready(function() { $("#tabs").tabs(); });   how can I see in which of the included files is this defined
[08:32:35] <Cork> a side note, you can create this without js :)
[08:32:47] <xec> then on a click on <a> inside .nav-tabs it hides all tabs (line 3), then finds whatever element matches the hash on the link and shows it (line 4)
[08:33:16] <xec> challenge accepted!
[08:33:30] <Cork> radio buttons and label ftw :)
[08:34:17] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/d3p1vhaw/9/
[08:34:40] * xec drops the mic he had in his other hand
[08:34:46] <Cork> ah, ya, that is another way to do it
[08:35:19] <xec> of course, you can only have one set of tabs on a page ;)
[08:35:22] <Cork> and it even let the visitor store the tab as bookmarks :)
[08:35:33] <xec> yeah thats true ;D
[08:35:38] <Cork> xec: well as long as they have different ids...
[08:35:48] <xec> only one id can ever be active
[08:35:54] <Cork> ah, true
[08:36:01] <sigdk> xec, you mean at the rendered page, right click and inspect element ?
[08:36:09] <xec> sigdk: wat
[08:36:25] <sigdk> <xec> then on a click on <a> inside .nav-tabs it hides all tabs (line 3), then finds whatever element matches the hash on the link and shows it (line 4)
[08:36:37] <xec> sigdk: with the line numbers i was referring to the javascript code in the demo at /8
[08:37:44] <jak2000> why when execute an ajax request i get this error: "Not connected.\nPlease verify your network connection."   not understand why....
[08:37:45] <sigdk> xec, why did you put a container div ?
[08:37:55] <xec> sigdk: I didn't?
[08:38:03] <sigdk> you did... why ?
[08:38:12] <xec> i didn't.
[08:38:31] <xec> sigdk: http://jsfiddle.net/d3p1vhaw/6/ has exact same html
[08:39:00] <sigdk> xec, sorry, my mistake
[08:39:52] <sigdk> xec, so you just added the js part...  no other modification
[08:39:56] <xec> right
[08:39:58] <xec> well
[08:40:03] <xec> i included jquery in the dropdown
[08:40:53] <xec> does bootstrap require jquery?
[08:41:04] <jak2000> xec any advice?
[08:41:15] <Cork> xec: no
[08:41:27] <Cork> bootstrap is an independent lib
[08:41:29] <hellyeah> hey
[08:41:31] <xec> jak2000: did you verify your network connection?
[08:41:31] <hellyeah> hey i try to calculate x-axis and y-axis of objects. Is that true approach for doing this? http://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/1/
[08:42:16] <jak2000> i am here...
[08:42:24] <jak2000> not need network connection
[08:42:33] <jak2000> not execute my jsp file :(
[08:43:02] <xec> jak2000: well, what i mean is, are you sure you can connect to whatever you're trying to reach with that ajax request?
[08:45:13] <jak2000> netbeans have the posibility of debug the jsp file, but not acces to the file.. (i checked the name and path and is correct
[08:45:15] <jak2000> strange strange
[08:45:18] <taplar> hellyeah: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetLeft
[08:46:06] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[08:46:13] <taplar> they're different
[08:46:15] <hellyeah> taplar: does it soung logical to you when you move object same position with another object., create a div then put thos two objects into that div?
[08:46:25] <hellyeah> does it sound logical?
[08:46:40] <taplar> huh?
[08:47:20] <hellyeah> check out this https://jsfiddle.net/c0wm2nxt/5/ when you move object onto another. I will create div and put those two object into that div.
[08:47:30] <sigdk> xec, my code (it's not what I pasted... has something like this: $(document).ready(function() { $("#tabs").tabs(); });   how can I find the file that tabs() is defined ?
[08:47:45] <taplar> ok... ?
[08:47:59] <hellyeah> ok?
[08:48:28] <taplar> that's a really abstract ui interaction.  could be ok.  i don't know what your going to use it for
[08:48:40] <hellyeah> ah okey
[08:48:54] <hellyeah> it is used for group,ng
[08:49:00] <hellyeah> grouping
[08:49:07] <taplar> also if your writing your own draggable script, draggable scripts already exist
[08:49:26] <hellyeah> hmm jquery ui?
[08:49:26] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[08:49:51] <hellyeah> i wont prefer writing my own if i can have opton
[08:49:55] <hellyeah> option*
[08:50:05] <jak2000> any jquery plugin for a choose a date and time?
[08:51:05] <taplar> idk about time, but datepicker will do the calendar thing
[08:51:36] <jak2000> datepicker of jquery site?
[08:51:40] <taplar> yeah
[08:51:47] <hellyeah> jquery ui
[08:54:12] <taplar> just found this on the googs: http://plugins.jquery.com/datetimepicker/
[08:54:49] <taplar> looks pretty nice
[08:55:26] <taplar> http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/ <-- the inline date picker and dark theme ones
[09:59:08] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Yo! Anyone who uses jquery touch punch who knows of a way to increase sensitivity for draggable objects? Feels like it's not always super responsive
[10:17:41] <Mark__> which code should i use in in order to have a spinner until the .post or .load complete their loadings anyone?
[10:20:07] <worknick> hi
[10:20:16] <worknick> where can i get the tabs css here? https://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[10:20:52] <worknick> nvm.
[10:24:53] <worknick> its source lits style.css and that file do not have any sytle for tabs
[11:06:42] <jo019> Hi, I've got a simple thing to do that works fine with PHP but I can't get it to work with jQuery 2. My login form validates of a user exists in the database before showing the password field. I'd like to do that check using AJAX. Where should I store my query result and how to retreive it?
[11:16:09] <chiragSoni> Hello everyone! I'm am enthusiast programmer. I'm interested in Google Summer of Code (gsoc) and want to work on some project of jquery foundation. I want to ask, will jquery participate in gsoc 2016?
[11:28:20] <Mark__> um,
[11:28:34] <Mark__> what do i have to use if i want a jquery click delayed a few seconds?
[11:28:40] <Mark__> .delay doesn’t seem to work
[11:55:44] <BillCriswell> @Mark__ You'd use delay for things in a queue. It sounds like you might just want a timeout (or an (animation|transtion)-delay.
[11:56:08] <Mark__> thanks.i already got it solved by using setTimeout
[12:07:22] <MichaelAMiller> I have a question about handling submit events. I feel like maybe the documentation isnt clear, but it's probably just me.
[12:09:12] <MichaelAMiller> http://api.jquery.com/submit/ says the 'submit' event can only be attached to <form> elements, but then goes on to talk about how as of jQuery 1.4, scripts that rely on event delegation with the submit event will work consistently.
[12:09:56] <MichaelAMiller> I guess my question is just, is it possible to do $('body').on('submit', function (e) { alert('Submit!'); });
[12:11:33] <NoiseEee> MichaelAMiller: if only there were a way to test that...
[12:11:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:12:00] <MichaelAMiller> :) I have tested it, with inconsistent results.
[12:12:17] <MichaelAMiller> $('body').on('submit', function (e) { alert('Submit!'); });  // Appears to work
[12:12:20] <robertmaxrees> use .on(‘submit’, ‘form’, function() {});
[12:12:27] <robertmaxrees> that should work pretty consistently.
[12:12:27] <MichaelAMiller> $('body').on('submit', 'form', function (e) { alert('Submit!'); }); // Appears to not work.
[12:12:44] <robertmaxrees> that seems wrong.
[12:12:50] <MichaelAMiller> Which is why I'm here. :)
[12:12:54] <robertmaxrees> are you preventing default?
[12:12:58] <robertmaxrees> and what version of jquery?
[12:14:13] <NoiseEee> MichaelAMiller: ^^....  make sure the form is told to not actually submit/go to a new URI
[12:14:24] <MichaelAMiller> I am not preventing default. jQuery v1.10.2 on Chrome  46.0.2490.86 m
[12:14:32] <chiragSoni> Hello everyone! I'm an enthusiast programmer. I'm interested in Google Summer of Code (gsoc) and want to work on some project of jquery foundation. I want to ask, will jquery apply to participate in gsoc 2016?
[12:14:33] <Brodingo> http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/nbz3ttjj/
[12:14:46] <robertmaxrees> chiragSoni you’ll want to go to #jquery-dev and ask there.
[12:14:58] <NoiseEee> MichaelAMiller: there you go then; prevent the default action of actually going to a new URI
[12:15:15] <robertmaxrees> and use console.log() for debugging.
[12:15:19] <chiragSoni> robertmaxrees: Ok, thanks
[12:15:21] <MichaelAMiller> But how do I go that? The event handler is not being called.
[12:15:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:15:33] <robertmaxrees> MichaelAMiller it sure is in that fiddle that Brodingo just shared.
[12:18:01] <MichaelAMiller> Hmm, there must be something else catching it first and preventing it from bubbling on  my page. Thank you for your help.
[12:18:36] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the prevent default is the issue here.
[12:19:02] <Brodingo> MichaelAMiller thats possiblte if there is another event handler using return false or event.stopPropogation()
[12:19:15] <MichaelAMiller> I think I mis-spoke when I said I wasnt calling it. It's being called in my event, but my event isnt firing.
[12:19:25] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:19:31] <robertmaxrees> the event IS firing,t he handler is the issue.
[12:20:12] <MichaelAMiller> Sorry, you're correct.
[12:38:43] <blitz-_> If i create a number of divs with say class "divcontent" where first one is visible rest is "none". Whats the best approach to paginate through them?
[12:39:15] <robertmaxrees> get the index of the one you can see, hide that one, show the index + 1
[12:40:14] <blitz-_> Great, thank you
[12:57:09] <royalty> robertmaxrees, what up big daddy
[12:57:38] <robertmaxrees> i ain’tcho daddy ;)
[12:57:50] <royalty> lolll
[12:58:12] <royalty> do you have a github?
[12:58:17] <royalty> i want to github stalk you
[12:58:17] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:58:21] <robertmaxrees> not really much there.
[12:58:27] <robertmaxrees> probably a lot of old garbage.
[12:58:31] <royalty> lolll
[12:58:54] <royalty> link me!
[12:59:15] <robertmaxrees> uh, pretty easy to find.
[12:59:49] <royalty> robertmaxrees, this one? https://github.com/robb
[13:00:00] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:00:02] <robertmaxrees> i don’t do IOS.
[13:00:25] <robertmaxrees> and i’m in the US.
[13:00:51] <royalty> oh found you
[13:01:13] <royalty> This may or may not become my primary blogging environment. For now, it's a code blog. It's about, well, code. Mostly JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. All opinions here are solely my own and do not reflect those of my employer, spouse, parents, cat, or beer.
[13:01:13] <royalty> Though beer is tasty...
[13:01:45] <royalty> ahahaha you are from california as well!
[13:02:33] <royalty> i actually like the advice i am reading on your home page
[13:05:15] <robertmaxrees> ‘kay.
[13:05:57] <royalty> how is it up there far north
[13:06:08] <royalty> does it ever snow in your city?
[13:06:08] <robertmaxrees> “far north”?
[13:06:09] <robertmaxrees> oi’
[13:06:14] <robertmaxrees> *i’m not really that far north.
[13:06:21] <robertmaxrees> and i’m like 200ft above sea level here.
[13:06:28] <royalty> hmmm
[13:10:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:15:56] <MichaelAMiller> Ok, I'm offically calling it quits on my form submit issue from earlier. :)
[13:16:12] <robertmaxrees> can’t figure it out?
[13:16:51] <MichaelAMiller> I brought my page down to the minimum I could without breaking other necessary parts to test it, and it still didnt work.
[13:17:02] <MichaelAMiller> It works in incognito mode, which tells me maybe an extension is messing with it, but disabling all of the extensions doesnt fix it.
[13:17:06] <robertmaxrees> show us your code then.
[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[13:18:16] <MichaelAMiller> I'm not sure I can make it not work in fiddle. I've got a deadline I have to meet today, so I have to give up for now.
[13:18:42] <robertmaxrees> err, okay.
[13:18:56] <NoiseEee> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging @ MichaelAMiller good luck
[13:24:49] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com is another good one.
[13:59:18] <MichaelAMiller> I'm back! :)
[13:59:46] <MichaelAMiller> I'm not sure why it sometimes worked in incognito mode, but I discovered I had a form inside of a form, and that's what was breaking everything. Thanks for your help.
[13:59:55] <robertmaxrees> that would do it :)
[14:00:10] <fission6> anyone way to avoid select2 flicker for dropdowns
[14:00:28] <MichaelAMiller> I knew a form couldnt contain a form, but I didnt realize I forgot to </form> the first one.
[14:01:06] <robertmaxrees> fission6 you mean when they first initialize?
[14:01:13] <fission6> robertmaxrees: yes!
[14:01:24] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[14:01:33] <robertmaxrees> speed up the whole page.
[14:01:41] <robertmaxrees> prioritize things, etc.
[14:01:42] <fission6> robertmaxrees: yea i am loading  alot of JS
[14:01:45] <MichaelAMiller> @fission6, I make sure to init select2 as soon as possible, but there is still a slight flicker. I worked around it by just keeping the select hidden (with a "loading" message) until its ready
[14:01:59] <robertmaxrees> make sure you’re not loading more than you need.
[14:02:08] <MichaelAMiller> But making sure to init as soon as possible makes a huge difference.
[14:02:11] <robertmaxrees> and load things in the right order, defer where you can.
[14:02:37] <MichaelAMiller> Thanks again for your help.
[14:46:34] <manafount> Hey guys. I've been playing around with a template that uses jquery for animations, and I'm getting tripped up on something seemingly basic. Whenever I click on my CTA, it throws a jquery error "unrecognized expression". Here's the site in question: http://dev.b2bconnector.com/
[14:47:29] <WillPittenger> Given a JQuery element object, how do you get the enclosed text?  Is there an equivalent to innerText?
[14:47:30] <robertmaxrees> show us the event handler.
[14:47:57] <robertmaxrees> WillPittenger .text()
[14:49:00] <robertmaxrees> manafount oh, that’s easy - $($anchor.attr('href')) which is trying to do $(‘http://dev.b2bconnector.com/register’);
[14:49:47] <ExtraSteve> Strange question, but is there a way to detect if a color is "too dark" to be a background color?
[14:50:08] <robertmaxrees> ExtraSteve
[14:50:11] <robertmaxrees> “detect”?
[14:50:15] <ExtraSteve> I know :/
[14:50:26] <robertmaxrees> what’s the problem you’re solving?
[14:50:42] <ExtraSteve> Like, if a div's background-color is too dark for the font color to be visible with ease, I'd like to switch the font color to be lighter
[14:50:56] <manafount> robertmaxrees thanks for taking a look, but I'm still a bit out of my depth. do I need to format my link differently?
[14:51:04] <robertmaxrees> that’s not really something you’d do with JS ExtraSteve
[14:51:14] <ExtraSteve> Essentially, I'd like a user to be able to define their own background color for something but I don't want to make them choose their own foreground also
[14:51:16] <robertmaxrees> manafount err, yeah.  right now it’s pointing to a separate page.
[14:51:41] <robertmaxrees> ExtraSteve flip the problem on its head - give them a selection of pretermined colors they can choose from.
[14:51:46] <manafount> robertmaxrees whoops!
[14:51:46] <robertmaxrees> instead of a generic color picker.
[14:51:48] <WillPittenger> robertmaxrees: Thanks.  I missed that function. :p
[14:52:02] <manafount> robertmaxrees thanks. that's embarrassing
[14:52:08] <robertmaxrees> manafount not a big deal :)
[14:52:12] <robertmaxrees> WillPittenger definitely.
[14:53:34] <ExtraSteve> robertmaxrees: hmm, I was hoping there'd be a clever way of just detecting the contrast or osmething between two colors
[14:53:40] <ExtraSteve> Since they're all technically numeric, right?
[14:53:56] <robertmaxrees> ExtraSteve sure you COULD do that, but you’re giving your users a little too much choice ther.e
[14:54:00] <robertmaxrees> don’t hand them a footgun.
[14:54:08] <robertmaxrees> make things easier for yourself.
[14:54:26] <ExtraSteve> heh
[14:54:28] <ExtraSteve> Fair enough
[14:54:49] <robertmaxrees> :) good example of why you rarely see color pickers for that kind of UX.
[15:19:18] <MikeD_> I have an array of table of contents items.  Each one is currently being added as a div to another div (i know) and the .click() functionality is assigned to each as they are added to the dom.  Is this a suboptimal way to manage this content?
[15:19:35] <MikeD_> i feel like delegation would be much smarter
[15:20:07] <robertmaxrees> much
[15:20:13] <robertmaxrees> always delegate.
[15:20:25] <robertmaxrees> got a bunch of elements that need the same handler?  delegate.
[15:20:30] <robertmaxrees> gonna dynamically add things?  delegate.
[15:20:46] <MikeD_> thanks.  I really hate other people's code.
[15:20:50] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:20:54] <MikeD_> (I hate my own too, but other people's more)
[15:32:38] <MikeD_> ex: tab.VIEW_CAPTION.replace(" ","_").replace(".","_");
[15:39:06] <manafount> Is there a best way to tell which piece of jquery code is affecting an html element? For example, robertmaxrees, how were you able to tell that the template I was using was attempting to turn my link into an anchor tag?
[15:39:51] <robertmaxrees> need to modify your question :)
[15:40:02] <robertmaxrees> i can tell you what event listeners are bound to an element.
[15:40:15] <robertmaxrees> that’s done through your browser’s developer tools.
[15:40:20] <WillPittenger> Is the object returned by $ for a selector a Javascript Array?  I need to concatenate and sort two selectors.
[15:40:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.  it’s a jquery object.
[15:40:57] <robertmaxrees> you can merge the two by using .add()
[15:41:32] <manafount> Ah. I was told by someone else to try using Firebug, which seems very similar to chrome's dev tools.
[15:41:46] <robertmaxrees> manafount it is.  the native firefox dev tools are my preference these days.
[15:41:53] <WillPittenger> robertmaxrees: Thanks.  What about a sort?
[15:41:57] <robertmaxrees> there’s a little “ev” next to elements with listeners on themm.
[15:41:57] <manafount> thanks for the input :)
[15:42:10] <robertmaxrees> WillPittenger really depends - what’s the end goal for the data?
[15:42:34] <robertmaxrees> WillPittenger like, is there a reason you don’t just have some json you can use to render things out instead?
[15:43:30] <WillPittenger> Displaying them sorted.  The objects are are existing links that I'm moving to a new parent and sorting by the link text.  Trouble is that I need different selectors.
[15:43:47] <robertmaxrees> you can use two different selectors for one jquery object.
[15:43:52] <robertmaxrees> $(‘selector1, selector2’);
[15:44:05] <WillPittenger> It'll sort?
[15:44:25] <robertmaxrees> they’ll be in the order they appear in the DOM.
[15:44:40] <WillPittenger> That might work for me.
[15:45:41] <robertmaxrees> but if you need to sort it based on text, I might just .map().get() your data and rebuild them?
[15:45:43] <WillPittenger> Except $ returns an empty object.
[15:45:45] <robertmaxrees> kind of hard to say.
[15:45:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:46:01] <robertmaxrees> $ returns the jquery object.
[15:46:19] <WillPittenger> I think the links are sorted to start with.
[15:46:31] <WillPittenger> $(selector1, selector2).length is 0.
[15:46:39] <robertmaxrees> $(‘selector1, selector2’);
[15:46:50] <robertmaxrees> one string.
[15:47:05] <WillPittenger> Oh.
[15:47:10] <WillPittenger> Much better.
[15:48:07] <WillPittenger> But they aren't sorted to start with like I was thinking they were.
[15:48:22] <WillPittenger> So it's the map route.
[15:48:34] <robertmaxrees> so then grab all them like you’ve got, .map() the relevant data into a new array, etc.
[15:58:07] <WillPittenger> robertmaxrees: Doesn't map work on each element individually?  Based on the documentation, I don't see how it can sort.
[16:08:37] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:08:42] <robertmaxrees> you’re looking at it wrong :)
[16:09:06] <robertmaxrees> .map() to return out an object for each link.
[16:09:12] <robertmaxrees> then you sort that.
[16:09:25] <WillPittenger> Oh.  OK.
[16:10:21] <robertmaxrees> so .map(function() {return {’href’: $(this).attr(‘href’), ‘text’: $(this).text()} }).get()
[16:10:31] <robertmaxrees> the .get() gives you a plain array to work with.
[16:36:37] <Validatorian> Any tips on how to compile a bunch of <li>s with data attributes into a JS object? so <li data-foo="bar">item</li><li data-foo="baz">item2</li> becomes { item: 'bar', item2: 'baz' }
[16:36:48] <robertmaxrees> .map()
[16:36:55] <robertmaxrees> with an extra .get() call.
[16:38:08] <robertmaxrees> err, wait that would be .each() into an objkect.
[16:38:10] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[16:39:37] <robertmaxrees> wait haha Validatorian why not use an array in this case?
[16:39:49] <Validatorian> backend is expecting an object :-/
[16:40:24] <robertmaxrees> so the text is the key and the data attr is the value?
[16:40:33] <Validatorian> yep
[16:41:08] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, create an object and .each() through the elements and dynamically add things the way you want.
[16:41:44] <Validatorian> alright, that'll work -- was hoping there was some obscure function that'd be better :) Thanks robertmaxrees
[16:41:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:41:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1zx08x95/ just like this.
[16:46:58] <otahak> am I allowed to ask peoples opinions here?
[16:47:08] <robertmaxrees> are they related to jquery?
[16:47:10] <otahak> (on IDEs, not like politics or some BS)
[16:47:21] <robertmaxrees> i guess?
[16:47:23] <robertmaxrees> what’s up?
[16:47:35] <otahak> the thing is, I mostly just use sublime/vim and terminal for my dev'ing
[16:47:58] <otahak> buddy of mine swears up and down by IDEs
[16:48:10] <otahak> and I would like to do more. I was hoping ppl would give me their toolset and why they like 'em
[16:48:23] <robertmaxrees> that’s a pretty broad question.
[16:48:29] <markh> for frontend, you won't really beat a build tool like grunt/gulp/webpack
[16:48:30] <robertmaxrees> and is highly dependend on a lot of things :)
[16:48:32] <otahak> well, its not that im looking for a right answer
[16:48:52] <otahak> just answers in general, and for exactly that reason - there's so many different reasons to use different ones
[16:49:03] <robertmaxrees> right, but the kinds of answers you’ll get change depending on OS and which “end” of the stack you’re mostly living in.
[16:49:13] <markh> at my work, we do a lot of java stuff, which is pretty cool in an ide
[16:49:34] <otahak> I hear ya. well, to clarify - I'd like to dev my own api, preferably in php but with an eye open to node and other stuff
[16:49:48] <robertmaxrees> so then this has nothing to do with jquery ;)
[16:49:51] <otahak> mostly kind of a "backend tinker box"
[16:49:55] <markh> #web
[16:49:57] <otahak> well, I would want jquery support obvi lol
[16:50:08] <otahak> psh. web ran me out cos I wanted opinions lol
[16:50:20] <robertmaxrees> i’m going to reformulate the discussion then.
[16:50:28] <markh> do they have a strict no-opinions-allowed policy?
[16:50:28] <royalty> wew lad
[16:50:45] <otahak> not that I saw
[16:50:52] <otahak> but I also didn't go out of my way to read the policy in its entirety
[16:51:09] <robertmaxrees> :) for general web development, it’s nice to have one IDe and one good editor under your belt.
[16:51:19] <otahak> I mean.. I guess I just didnt see the harm in asking fellow dev's how they go about their business lol
[16:51:36] <markh> i will say that i hope bower gets its act together, and that for basic development, i use a combination of grunt and bower to develop.
[16:51:38] <robertmaxrees> otahak that question doesn’t really fit into the standard format of most channels.
[16:51:53] <robertmaxrees> otahak so that’s why web probably ran you out.
[16:52:00] <otahak> and while I can understand and respect that - I also just kinda wanted to ... yknow... chat. :)
[16:52:15] <robertmaxrees> so when did you ask in #web?
[16:52:22] <robertmaxrees> because i’m not seeing your screenname pop up in there?
[16:52:33] <otahak> mightve been php then
[16:52:38] <robertmaxrees> that’s why.
[16:52:39] <royalty> i'll chat with you all day bby
[16:52:45] <otahak> ty royalty <3
[16:52:53] <royalty> you can join my secret chatroom
[16:52:59] <otahak> I mean, Im not trashin' on anyone. your chatroom, your rules.
[16:53:05] <otahak> again - I just wanna be a better dev.
[16:53:23] <royalty> #secretChat
[16:53:24] <robertmaxrees> so as far as tools go, I use intellij since we do java dev here and it has nice node support.
[16:53:45] <otahak> right on. thanks robertmaxrees
[16:53:54] <markh> robertmaxrees what's your site run on?
[16:53:57] <markh> custom?
[16:54:11] <robertmaxrees> depends on the stack ;)
[16:54:16] <royalty> i use atom since i try to support open sauce and don't need much besides a glorified text editor
[16:54:18] <robertmaxrees> i use sublime like 95% of the time.
[16:54:30] <otahak> royalty - been looking at atom. might switch from sublime.
[16:54:48] <robertmaxrees> VS Code looks REALLY promising, but I have a few nitpicks holding me back.
[16:54:50] <royalty> otahak, there aren't many advantages so far that i can tell, i'm far from a power user though
[16:55:14] <markh> i didn't like atom. i wanted to, but i didn't. i basically use sublime, vim if im ssh into our servers and i'm editing something simple, and intellij if i'm doing any java stuff.
[16:55:15] <robertmaxrees> markh we run a java services layer and then coldfusion for our legacy platforms and node for everything else.
[16:55:32] <otahak> markh - that's kinda how I do my thing too. I work mostly in php/js
[16:55:55] <markh> robertmaxrees, interesting. that's cool. we used magento and then switched to shopify, i don't have much experience with custom ecommerce stuff.
[16:56:04] <robertmaxrees> we used magento a long time ago.
[16:56:07] <otahak> haha
[16:56:09] <robertmaxrees> ran into MASSIVE headaches with it.
[16:56:10] <otahak> we use opencart :(
[16:56:15] <markh> oof.
[16:56:19] <otahak> pray for mojo.
[16:56:23] <markh> magento was a pain
[16:56:32] <royalty> i HATE the xml stuff
[16:56:35] <robertmaxrees> we have too many SKUs so it wasn’t really appropriate for us.
[16:56:43] <royalty> wat
[16:56:53] <royalty> unless you have over 10k it should have been fine
[16:56:57] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:56:57] <markh> yeah, we had like, 40,000 SKUs i believe
[16:56:59] <otahak> magento just seemed too bloated. would lag the fiddle sticks out of our server.
[16:57:03] <robertmaxrees> we have well over 10k
[16:57:09] <royalty> hmmmm
[16:57:14] <royalty> i would think it could support 100k
[16:57:20] <royalty> before getting toooo slow
[16:57:24] <markh> we were running community
[16:57:24] <royalty> i dunno tho
[16:57:39] <markh> we switched to shopify plus and it worked very well
[16:57:44] <robertmaxrees> heh you’d be really surprised.  we also had to reindex shit constantly and had lots of other pain points.
[16:57:55] <royalty> anyway when i think about it i almost feel like it's legacy software
[16:58:18] <royalty> remembering how i had to go back and do a lot for a simple change
[16:58:35] <markh> yup. i would avoid magento, were i to start from scratch today. i also wouldn't trust opencart for any large-scale anything
[16:58:54] <royalty> i mainly wrote scripts that read products from csv
[16:59:02] <royalty> and imported them into magento
[16:59:07] <otahak> anybody here ever fucks with coda?
[17:01:11] <robertmaxrees> i avoid editors with previews.
[17:01:51] <markh> when i have to create emails (don't ask), i use brackets, which has the only decent live preview that i've found.
[17:02:14] <royalty> lol the whole 90s table code thing?
[17:02:14] <otahak> thanks for the feedback guys! have a good evening!
[17:02:22] <royalty> markh, sorry i asked
[17:02:34] <markh> royalty, yes.
[17:02:38] <markh> here's a preview:
[17:02:55] <markh> <table width="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="padding: 0; margin: 0; line-height: 0; font-size: 0; border-collapse: collapse; mso-table-lspace: 0pt; mso-table-rspace: 0pt;">
[17:02:58] <royalty> i used to work for a subcontractor for burger king on their emails
[17:03:15] <royalty> and yeah you are trying to make them responsive...
[17:03:23] <royalty> i can tell....
[17:03:30] <royalty> man i HATE
[17:03:33] <royalty> those
[17:03:40] <markh> thankfully, i don't do much of that ajyk0re
[17:03:51] <markh> anymore
[17:05:13] <royalty> markh, i know right
[17:05:44] <royalty> markh, i wish there was a reliable way to outsource that work
[17:05:59] <markh> there isn't
[17:06:19] <royalty> we got some other people to do it then we ran into a ton of bugs
[17:06:23] <markh> devs at my work have a hard enough time as it is, because most of them weren't developing in the early 2000s when tables were all the rage
[17:06:26] <royalty> and mess ups between things
[17:06:31] <royalty> ahahaha
[17:06:40] <royalty> i had to fix them and such
[17:11:06] <robertmaxrees> ugh coldfusion
[17:14:36] <royalty> robertmaxrees, do you like coldfusion?
[17:14:43] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[17:14:53] <robertmaxrees> we’re movign away from it as soon as possible.
[17:15:08] <arc_> i never really got why people bothered to make those hugely complex email layouts. seems like you're better off just making a website, taking a screenshot of it, and sending that through email, and directing the user to the website when they click anywhere
[17:15:32] <robertmaxrees> arc_ because when they search through their email, they don’t find your ad.
[17:15:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:15:40] <arc_> : /
[17:15:47] <robertmaxrees> and sometimes, there’s relevant info in them.
[17:15:49] <arc_> hidden text
[17:16:05] <robertmaxrees> my company legit tries to actually provide relevant info in our emails.
[17:16:37] <royalty> arc_, that's pretty much what burger king did except specific areas referred to different links
[17:16:45] <arc_> yeah an image map
[17:16:50] <royalty> ]most of the email was a huge image map
[17:16:51] <royalty> yeah
[17:16:51] <robertmaxrees> that used to be a semi-common practice.
[17:17:19] <arc_> i mean, mixing images and text would be fine, but it seems like usually you could do just one column with an image in one row and then text in a separate row
[17:18:22] <markh> we have responsive emails. it's actually kind of cool. people pay a LOT of money for emails.
[17:18:29] <NoiseEee> so gross
[17:20:25] <markh> yeah... the fuckery used to get it to respond is clever, but all in all it's a huge mess.
[17:20:53] <robertmaxrees> sounds like all of development.
[17:21:07] <NoiseEee> i can't even imagine how different clients handle it
[17:21:19] <NoiseEee> thunderbird, outlook, web (hotmail etc), "windows 10 mail", "mac mail" etc
[17:21:22] <markh> we support back to outlook 2000 and ie6
[17:21:24] <NoiseEee> i'd rather slice my eyes open
[17:21:25] <markh> my life is a nightmare
[17:21:48] <markh> i can't use js' .map() or .forEach()
[17:21:58] <NoiseEee> well i hope you're well compensated for it at least, markh
[17:22:27] <markh> not really :D
[17:24:46] <royalty> can you transpile so ecma6 js is ecma1?
[17:24:47] <royalty> LOL
[17:25:01] <robertmaxrees> not all of it.
[17:25:03] <robertmaxrees> but close.
[17:25:15] <markh> yeah i have polyfills for things i need
[17:25:26] <markh> hell, getElementsByClassName isn't supported until ie9
[17:25:38] <robertmaxrees> why not just es5-shim?
[17:25:41] <royalty> ]wow
[17:26:14] <markh> robertmaxrees, we are an ad company basically, so we try to load as little as possible on client sites
[17:26:19] <royalty> oh yeah actually that makes sense, markh you can use getElmementsByTagName though right?
[17:26:32] <markh> getElementById, getElementsByTagName
[17:26:40] <markh> and we have a polyfill for getElementsByClassName
[17:26:42] <royalty> kewl
[17:26:57] <markh> polyfill? shim? whatever
[17:27:55] <royalty> do you guys have a legacy computer you test ie6 on?
[17:28:18] <royalty> i remember there is special code to use opacity on ie8
[17:28:28] <arc_> shouldn't you be able to test it in a vm
[17:28:35] <robertmaxrees> fwiw https://dev.windows.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/windows/
[17:28:40] <arc_> ya
[17:29:38] <markh> yeah, i have virtualbox + vagrant for stuff
[17:37:41] <robertmaxrees> loooove vagrant.
[17:38:27] <markh> yeah me too
[17:39:18] <markh> i've been learning ruby/rails lately, and i've been using vagrant to avoid all the "getting set up" problems my computer usually has
[17:39:29] <robertmaxrees> why RoR?
[17:39:41] <royalty> so he can contract out for more $.$
[17:40:04] <royalty> i mean yeah markh why RoR?
[17:40:22] <robertmaxrees> legacy codebases?
[17:40:29] <markh> i have a potential job offer from a friend and their stack is RoR
[17:40:30] <robertmaxrees> i just don’t know anybody using it for anything.
[17:40:36] <acidjazz> RoR is an asian LoL
[17:40:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:40:47] <robertmaxrees> heh, borderline not ok ;)
[17:40:52] <acidjazz> oh come on you laughed
[17:40:53] <markh> i would be doing ux/frontend stuff
[17:40:58] <acidjazz> admit it
[17:41:14] <royalty> enjoy coffeescript
[17:41:21] <acidjazz> <3 coffeescript
[17:41:24] <robertmaxrees> no more cfscript pls
[17:41:29] <royalty> meh i never even attempted learning it lol
[17:41:43] <acidjazz> so i hated coffee
[17:41:56] <acidjazz> until i learned how you can learn js by watching how coffee compiles js
[17:42:19] <acidjazz> cs is a massive community now w/ alot contributions on what people think is proper  compatible js
[17:42:37] <robertmaxrees> the source it’s always made has always looked awful to me hahaha
[17:42:38] <acidjazz> and so i like using it to help learn and understand different ways of writing funcs/loops/etc
[17:42:52] <acidjazz> yea true sometimes
[17:43:36] <robertmaxrees> always imo.  it’s super awkward and hard to read.  and with es5 (and some of es6’s features) you don’t really need it.
[17:47:18] <markh> i will pass on coffee
[17:47:23] <markh> i don't even drink coffee
[17:47:26] <markh> i ain't gonna write it
[17:47:56] <acidjazz> sorted
[17:50:49] <WillPittenger> When I call |$(selector).each(function(){})|, does each() put each call to the passed function in its own thread?  Or does the passed function block each() until it returns?
[17:50:49] <jeffreylevesque> is https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/5c2a01c678b60d890f476e7486baddb374e7c328/src/jsx/select_session.js a jsx file.  If so, could i change the extension from .js to .jsx?
[17:51:21] <robertmaxrees> WillPittenger javascript is single threaded soooo
[17:51:27] <shoky> jeffreylevesque: yes that's a jsx file. you can change the extension to anything you want ;)
[17:52:14] <WillPittenger> robertmaxrees: Well, my function is setting a global, but it's acting like the global isn't set.
[17:53:29] <WillPittenger> Well, the script is hanging when I try to set it.
[17:53:34] <robertmaxrees> WillPittenger why would you seta global?
[17:53:37] <robertmaxrees> mind showing the code?
[17:53:47] <WillPittenger> robertmaxrees: I need to remember a value.
[17:53:56] <WillPittenger> From one call to the next that is.
[17:54:02] <robertmaxrees> show the code then.
[17:54:07] <robertmaxrees> because something here seems weird.
[17:55:29] <WillPittenger> http://pastebin.com/0RTMdNpf
[17:57:16] <robertmaxrees> lastLetterGroup.append($("a", this).first()); won’t work.
[17:57:31] <robertmaxrees> lastLetterGroup isnt’ a jquery object.
[17:57:54] <robertmaxrees> and it looks like you’re conditionally building two separate jquery objects here, yeah?
[17:58:03] <robertmaxrees> newCatList and lastLetterGroup
[17:58:28] <WillPittenger> Well, line 7 shouldn't have been commented out.
[17:58:56] <robertmaxrees> then you’re going to have more problems.
[17:59:00] <robertmaxrees> it’;ll only have the last iteration.
[17:59:19] <robertmaxrees> i’d do $(".azcats > ul > li").filter() twice, once for each set of data, and then manipulate from there.
[17:59:48] <WillPittenger> newCatList is the parent of lastLetterGroup.  If lastLetterGroup is null, it places the new item (moved from the selector) in newCatList.  Otherwise, it moves the item into lastLetterGroup.
[17:59:48] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, the fact that you’re doing lastLetterGroup = $(":last-child", newCatList); is stomping over whatever the last iteration does/
[18:00:45] <robertmaxrees> brb meeting.
[18:01:44] <WillPittenger> As I understand it, append() doesn't return a JQuery object.  Just void.
[18:04:58] <WillPittenger> The input is a series of "li" tags.  Some of those list items have class "letter" applied.  Those begin a group.  Unfortunately, the groups don't have any structure in the DOM other than previously mentioned.
[18:05:39] <WillPittenger> What I'm doing is rearranging someone else's page with GreaseMonkey.
[18:07:16] <shoky> WillPittenger: "this" in line 9 is probably not what you think it is.. also, put a { } around the if's body on lines 10-13
[18:07:18] <robertmaxrees> bacl.
[18:07:33] <markh> the worlds shortest meeting
[18:07:33] <robertmaxrees> also: http://api.jquery.com/append/
[18:07:41] <robertmaxrees> nah, manager is just busy.
[18:07:41] <WillPittenger> shoky: I noticed.
[18:07:45] <robertmaxrees> append DOES return a jquery object.
[18:09:20] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/03dc0ad924c6 this is closer to what you want, though a little strange still, since that lastLetterGroup = $(":last-child", newCatList); doesn’t do what you think it does.
[18:09:26] <WillPittenger> robertmaxrees, shoky: Revised version: http://pastebin.com/FSc2JmKw
[18:09:48] <robertmaxrees> the lack of curlies is really hard to read.
[18:09:58] <robertmaxrees> and lastLetterGroup = $(":last-child", newCatList); is the root of your issue.
[18:10:10] <robertmaxrees> like, without changing that, you’re not going to get anyway.
[18:10:12] <robertmaxrees> *anywhere.
[18:10:32] <jeffreylevesque> can i use jshint, to lint jsx files?  trying to find out if there is a flag i can add to the `jshint` command
[18:10:57] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque i don’t think so.
[18:11:04] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/STRML/JSXHint/ should help you though.
[18:11:05] <shoky> WillPittenger: you dont have {} around the if's body in lines 13-16.  also jquery objects don't have a .getBoundingClientRect method, you'd need to access the element with e.g. [0]
[18:11:33] <robertmaxrees> shoky he’s explicitly passing in “this” which is a DOM node in that case.
[18:11:42] <robertmaxrees> still weird.
[18:11:57] <shoky> robertmaxrees: yeah but he's doing .getBounding.. on linkCur which is a jq obj
[18:12:02] <robertmaxrees> aaah that.
[18:12:04] <jeffreylevesque> i tried `jsxhint --jsx-only .`, but it linted `*.js` files too - https://travis-ci.org/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/builds/94282896#L972
[18:12:31] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque dunno - you might have more luck in a channel about jshint or react or something.
[18:13:21] <shoky> "JSXHint is, and always was, a bad hack to make JSX lintable in the early days of React. It will always be inferior to proper linters like ESLint because it is not able to lint JSX or ES6 syntax, it instead compiles to ES5 then lints. You may get weird linter errors, especially with more involved transforms."
[18:13:26] <shoky> fyi
[18:13:46] <robertmaxrees> hah
[18:14:09] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[18:14:18] <shoky> and it says about --jsx-only :  This will skip attempted conversion of .js files to JSX, but still lint those files
[18:14:34] <shoky> jeffreylevesque ^
[18:14:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah i’d hit up ##javascript or something instead.
[19:14:27] <WillPittenger> I still don't understand why you say that lines 11 and 13 of http://pastebin.com/AAU02JiZ are a problem.  In my tests, it isn't getting there.
[19:19:14] <WillPittenger> catListEntry is NEVER inside newCatList or curLetterGroup.
[19:20:10] <WillPittenger> newCatList is defined as $("body > #new-cat-list").
[19:20:49] <WillPittenger> Not shown, but .azcats is always a sibling of #new-cat-list.
[19:23:22] <compact> <form action="#" method="post"> i then have inputs in the form. however data: $(this.form).serialize() returns to null
[19:26:56] <compact> ??
[19:37:00] <shoky> compact: make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[19:56:14] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/o8dafwde/
[19:56:57] <shoky> woah totally new look on jsfiddle huh
[19:57:09] <shoky> could use some.. color
[19:58:14] <compact> haha true  true
[19:58:50] <shoky> compact: you can't do this.form  on an <a>, only on form inputs
[19:59:03] <shoky> compact:  you can do  $(this).closest('form')
[20:00:47] <compact> ah great. thanks heaps!
[20:27:35] <cpt-oblivious> hello, does anyone maybe have any Idea how to do a basic auth request with Jquery? The following fails: http://jsfiddle.net/cz7y852q/83/
[20:29:08] <robertmaxrees> “basic auth request”?
[20:30:38] <cpt-oblivious> yea like http basic authentication
[20:30:47] <cpt-oblivious> the Bing API requires that
[20:30:49] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/11960692/923919
[20:30:56] <cpt-oblivious> "https://api.datamarket.azure.com/Bing/Search/v1/Image?Query=%27eindhoven%27&$top=1&$format=json" this url works fine
[20:31:09] <cpt-oblivious> but it fails if I call it from getJSON
[20:31:10] <robertmaxrees> look at the link i just sent you.
[20:31:53] <cpt-oblivious> ok let me try that, thanks
[20:43:22] <cpt-oblivious> hmm, that also doesn't work
[20:48:56] <shoky> cpt-oblivious: try the 2nd example there, with the "headers" option.  and btw don't copy "async: false" from there.. in case you thought that's needed
[20:49:09] <cpt-oblivious> I've tried both :p
[20:49:12] <cpt-oblivious> and also async with false/true
[20:52:22] <sreggiNyllemS> HI NIGGERS
[20:52:53] <cpt-oblivious> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/cz7y852q/88/
[20:54:00] <shoky> cpt-oblivious: works fine if you remove the async and data
[20:54:17] <shoky> cpt-oblivious:  also works fine with "headers"  http://jsfiddle.net/cz7y852q/89/
[20:54:30] <cpt-oblivious> :O
[20:54:34] <cpt-oblivious> thanks a lot!
[20:54:42] <shoky> ;p
[20:54:58] <sreggiNyllemS> cpt-oblivious: alot*
[20:55:20] <cpt-oblivious> sreggiNyllemS: thank you for your contribution too :p
[20:55:20] <shoky> ;-o

[21:25:52] <ExterminatesweJ> why don't ops know how to ban people?
[21:53:31] <chartius> hi
[21:55:02] <d3m0n> Why the heck is this adding all the values to the data attribute instead of it's own value when going through each? http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/dYBOeK
[22:54:08] <peteretep> I am trying to build a request out of an object {}. This works fine when the object is flat: { "Foo": "bar" }. But I want to send an array of values: {"Foo": ["bar", "baz"]}, and get out: ?Foo=bar&Foo=baz
[22:54:44] <peteretep> I'm struggling to turn that in to googleable terms
[22:56:13] <Kamuela> peteretep: what are you using to send this request
[22:56:53] <peteretep> this.$$.ajax(request);
[22:57:01] <peteretep> I need to find a way to get the traditional flag in there, it would seem
[22:57:12] <peteretep> uh, assume that's jQuery.ajax()
[22:57:46] <peteretep> ah, that accepts a traditional flag
[22:57:53] <peteretep> Found it myself :-)
