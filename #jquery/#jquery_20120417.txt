[00:00:55] <coldhead> my favourite pop song
[00:02:30] <Ar-ras> coldhead i want to  make this typical two select box thing
[00:02:50] <Ar-ras> right selectbox you have all elements you need
[00:02:54] <Ar-ras> erm
[00:02:57] <Ar-ras> you have
[00:03:15] <Ar-ras> and in left box you have the "selected" elements
[00:03:44] <Ar-ras> and between this both selectboxes you move the items as needed
[00:06:12] <Ar-ras> do you know the name of this input "type"?
[00:09:07] <coldhead> i don't know what you mean sorry Ar-ras
[00:09:17] <coldhead> ?demo @ Ar-ras
[00:09:17] <bot-t> Ar-ras, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:09:33] <coldhead> from what you said i'm imagining jQuery UI draggable
[00:09:37] <coldhead> but that's probably not it
[00:09:39] <LukeNukem> coldhead, wazza
[00:09:46] <Ar-ras> nah its not draggable

[00:18:18] <LukeNukem> shama, im ashamed of my child hood music.
[00:18:20] <LukeNukem> T_T
[00:19:30] <coldhead> the only music i ever liked that i don't care for anymore is fear factory
[00:19:36] <coldhead> everything else is still doing it for me
[00:19:44] <coldhead> and that's saying something at my age
[00:19:55] <Anca> Hello
[00:20:02] <LukeNukem> Knocn knock knocking on heavens door <3
[00:20:18] <coldhead> hi Anca
[00:20:27] <coldhead> isn't that originally a bob dylan song LukeNukem ?
[00:20:27] <LukeNukem> November rain, sweet child o mine, paradise city
[00:20:40] <LukeNukem> I like the G n R song :) coldhead
[00:21:19] <Ar-ras> how about tokyo hotel?
[00:21:32] <coldhead> you like obscure stuff, Ar-ras
[00:21:37] <Ar-ras> :)))))))))))
[00:21:41] <Ar-ras> jk
[00:21:55] <LukeNukem> nobody likes The Black Sabbath?
[00:21:56] <coldhead> the only metal/industrial stuff i know much is like ministry and big black
[00:22:16] <coldhead> i want to like sabbath but you hear so much of them in pop culture
[00:22:20] <coldhead> it's hard to hear them properly
[00:22:26] <coldhead> same with really famous classical music
[00:22:31] <coldhead> used in so many ads :(
[00:22:46] <D4> How can I do .next() +1?
[00:23:04] <Ar-ras> .next().next()?
[00:23:05] <Anca> coldhead, listen to Fandango.. i don't think is used in any commercial
[00:23:07] <D4> Oh!
[00:23:37] <LukeNukem> I AM IRON MAN
[00:23:43] <Ar-ras> ne
[00:23:46] <LukeNukem> has hee lost his mind? Can he see or is he blind?
[00:23:48] <Ar-ras> you are iron maiden
[00:23:54] <LukeNukem> :\
[00:24:16] <LukeNukem> wait Enter Sandman is originally by motorhead?
[00:24:20] <LukeNukem> and not by metallica?
[00:24:40] <Anca> it;s all Metallica :)
[00:24:45] <LukeNukem> okie
[00:24:48] <Anca> 1991 i think
[00:24:53] <abjorn> sort of
[00:25:02] <abjorn> Metallica stole all their hits from bands nobody has ever heard of
[00:25:08] <abjorn> that have opened for them in the past
[00:25:11] <abjorn> true story
[00:25:23] <abjorn> They'd have bands open for them, then steal their songs
[00:25:27] <LukeNukem> metallica is still badass
[00:25:32] <Ar-ras> maybe we should punish them by burn their cds
[00:25:35] <abjorn> good tunes, though
[00:25:50] <abjorn> coldhead: you should listen to some Dio-era sabbath
[00:26:05] <LukeNukem> abjorn, Heaven and Hell
[00:26:12] <abjorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUjUIP2ugG4
[00:26:16] <abjorn> that's what i was about to suggest
[00:26:16] * coldhead takes notes
[00:26:17] <abjorn> lol
[00:26:17] <LukeNukem> Sing me a song, you're a singer. Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil <3
[00:26:36] <abjorn> dat dio
[00:27:37] <LukeNukem> true
[00:27:42] <LukeNukem> but i love ozzy
[00:27:49] <abjorn> meh
[00:27:52] <abjorn> he's okay
[00:27:57] <LukeNukem> no
[00:28:02] <abjorn> I mean, most of their best songs are from when Ozzy was with them
[00:28:03] <abjorn> for sure
[00:28:03] <LukeNukem> ozzy is legendary
[00:28:16] <LukeNukem> he is barely able to walk on concerts
[00:28:18] <LukeNukem> you noticed?
[00:28:31] <abjorn> I just...feel like he went so downhill after Sabbath
[00:28:35] <abjorn> mostly in his performances
[00:28:45] <abjorn> Because he was too fucking stoned and drunk
[00:28:49] <LukeNukem> He is often calleed the father of rock
[00:28:50] <abjorn> and now he's just permanently fucked up
[00:28:54] <LukeNukem> father of heavy metal*
[00:29:06] <abjorn> well now that's just untrue
[00:29:17] <abjorn> well, okay, technically people do call him that, yeah
[00:29:24] <LukeNukem> well, from what i've read his singing style influenced the heavy metal era
[00:29:48] <raj> can I see what static files are available on a website?
[00:29:55] <raj> without know the name/path of the file?
[00:30:00] <abjorn> his, robert plants, and ian gillian
[00:30:01] <raj> *knowing
[00:30:02] <Ar-ras> how can i change the order of option elements in select boxes?
[00:30:27] <Cork> raj: by website you mean the server?
[00:30:42] <raj> yes
[00:30:48] <Cork> Ar-ras: grab the element and insert it where you want it
[00:30:58] <abjorn> LukeNukem: But metal gets its roots out of the Yardbirds, the Kinks, and the like.
[00:31:01] <Cork> raj: only if the server provides a resource that tells it
[00:31:15] <LukeNukem> abjorn, i like to believe my version =P inspires me
[00:31:17] <LukeNukem> you know what i mean
[00:31:18] <Ar-ras> move option at position 3 to position 2
[00:31:23] <abjorn> not really, but sure
[00:31:27] <abjorn> doesn't matter to me
[00:31:34] <raj> so it would have to be linked to in the html?
[00:31:51] <Cork> in one way or another yes
[00:31:55] <Ar-ras> raj is directory listing off?
[00:32:12] <raj> huh?
[00:32:31] <raj> just wanna know if people can tell what static files I have made available
[00:32:47] <raj> besides what they're looking at the in the html page they're at
[00:32:56] <raj> ...whether they can see what other static files I have
[00:33:04] <Cork> yes they can get a list of all loaded menia
[00:33:07] <Cork> *media
[00:33:24] <Cork> if the browser has loaded them they can know about it
[00:33:35] <raj> right, but not for a page they're not at
[00:33:40] <Cork> no
[00:33:41] <raj> , k, cool, just wanted to make sure
[00:33:47] <Cork> only if the server provides it
[00:34:01] <Cork> raj: though don't use that as a security feature
[00:34:03] <Cork> cause its not
[00:34:12] <raj> cuz, next to style.css, I have abc.css, but I don't want anyone to see abc.css until I've launched its corresponding html page
[00:36:31] <doughj3> Anyone use fullcalendar?
[00:36:57] <ihnru> how does this plugin look to folks? http://johannburkard.de/resources/Johann/jquery.inc-6.js

[00:40:53] <LukeNukem> dr0id, yeah why?
[00:42:24] <ihnru> LukeNukem: fsf.org/facebook
[00:43:29] <LukeNukem> ihnru, my social network has the dislike button
[00:43:29] <LukeNukem> :3
[00:44:08] <ihnru> LukeNukem: what do you think of that plugin?
[00:44:19] <ihnru> I got YUi to accept it, btw.
[00:44:51] <LukeNukem> what plugin o.o
[00:54:07] <tapas> i'm working on a context menu extension for IE. this is fairly simple, but to make jquery's ajax calls work i have to add a script element to the document that's displayed in the browser..
[00:54:51] <tapas> so is there a way to add a script element that src's jquery in a way that might lead to no possible collisions in the original document?
[00:57:08] <tapas> i guess one possible way would be to host our version of jquery ourself and adapt it to use names that are very unlikely to conflict..
[00:59:31] <xec> that could work, or make 2 script tags, 1 with jquery and the next sibling with a var nameHere = $.noConflict(true); call
[01:00:39] <xec> a bit messy but makes it easier to update to newer version in the future
[01:14:44] <Ar-ras> lets see if my solution works under ie too xD
[01:15:11] <Ar-ras> works
[01:15:16] <tapas> xec: thanks..
[01:16:02] <tapas> i have this right now: http://pastesite.com/34522
[01:16:08] <tapas> and it seems to work..
[01:16:53] <tapas> and it works ok.. i just wonder what possible points of failure are, since this is supposed to work on pretty much all websites ;D
[01:17:25] <QuestPC> Hi! May please anyone help me with jquery scrollTop()? I have div with fixed height and overflow-y:auto; childrens of this div are "lines". I want to vertically scroll outer div so the inner div will be displayed in the middle of visible area, when inner div is clicked.
[01:17:32] <tapas> btw: i only go the route of appending script elements to the body of the original document since in the original context menu add-on  script ajax doesn't work at all
[01:17:50] <tapas> which is somewhat weird..
[01:18:14] <QuestPC> the following code does not work: this.$lines.scrollTop( this.$line().position().top );  where this.$lines is jQuery object for outer div, and this.$line() is jQuery object for inner div.
[01:18:56] <xec> tapas: you need to pass true to noConflict or you will only revert "$" (and not "jQuery")
[01:18:57] <Ar-ras> jsfiddle would be nicer to debug
[01:19:09] <tapas> xec: oh ok.. thanks..
[01:19:20] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[01:19:42] <QuestPC> this.$line().position().top returns incorrect value of vertical position, that's why this.$lines.scrollTop(); scrolls to improper position. Does anyone knows why position().top returns incorrect vertical position of inner div inside outer div?
[01:20:20] <QuestPC> Is that because position() counts the position relative to some another element (let's say parent of parent)? How can I fix that?
[01:20:26] <Ar-ras> QuestPC aint position giving ^^
[01:20:30] <ihnru> how can you access an attribute of the script element by which your script was called?
[01:20:38] <Ar-ras> QuestPC try offset
[01:20:57] <Cork> ihnru: you can't
[01:21:01] <Ar-ras> ihnru you mean get variable?
[01:21:02] <Cork> js doens't work like that
[01:21:17] <ihnru> Cork: are you sure? i didn't think so either, but then i saw it being used...
[01:21:18] <QuestPC> Ar-ras: the first (top) inner div gives position().top value 380, while it should be zero (0) relative to outer div (which has overflow-y and fixed height)
[01:21:24] * ihnru gets the link...
[01:21:34] <Ar-ras> afaik GET is possible, but POST is not
[01:21:45] <QuestPC> Ar-ras: offset() is relative to window, I need relative to outer div
[01:21:50] <Cork> ihnru: when the parser hits the script tag, it grabs the content and gives it to the js engin
[01:21:51] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/qRJbD/17/ I'm trying to get the showMenu div to show/disappear on hover ( which it does with the CSS) but with a nice slow fade in/out but it doesn't seem to  be working :x
[01:22:09] <Cork> ihnru: after that theres no relation between the script tag and the running script
[01:22:09] <ihnru> Cork: http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html#setup
[01:22:18] <Cork> ihnru: except for document.write
[01:22:19] <Ar-ras> questpc than do parent().position().top ?
[01:22:25] <ihnru> main-data="alkjsdjalksdf"
[01:22:30] <ihnru> see that, Cork ?
[01:23:13] <QuestPC> Ar-ras: that would be even larger value, no? I need smaller value. Cant understand why first div is not position().top === 0. Ok I'll try.
[01:23:22] <Cork> ihnru: they would have to loop through the script tags and look for it
[01:23:31] <retrostyle|15> hi dudes
[01:24:01] <retrostyle|15> how can i read aurl that returns a json stirng with jquery?
[01:24:03] <ihnru> ahh.
[01:24:07] <Cork> ihnru: it only works through active looking in the dom, cause scripts doens't have that relation
[01:24:19] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY- http://jsfiddle.net/qRJbD/18/
[01:24:22] <ihnru> Cork: is there any way to "pass" something to your script?
[01:24:35] <retrostyle|15> how can i read a url that returns a json stirng with jquery?
[01:24:45] <xec> retrostyle|15: you already said that
[01:25:00] <Cork> ihnru: three ways, have the script just define features and call it (like jquery does)
[01:25:12] <Cork> ihnru: 2. set a global variable before you include the script
[01:25:14] <retrostyle|15> sorry i would post it in another chan
[01:25:34] <Cork> ihnru: 3. pass the extra data to the server in the url and let it set that data in the response js
[01:25:36] <xec> retrostyle|15: don't cross post. have you tried $.ajax() ?
[01:25:37] <QuestPC> Ar-ras: For current set of dynamically generated inner divs, parent().position().top gives 329
[01:25:39] <Ar-ras> retrostyle|15 how about $.ajax({url: $url, datatype: 'json', function (data){}})
[01:25:46] <QuestPC> this.$line().parent().position().top === 329
[01:25:57] <QuestPC> this.$line().position().top === 330
[01:26:05] <peiper> hi I got an ul as $(this) with $(this).children() I get the li's is there an implented way to count the li's? like $(this).children().count() ?
[01:26:13] <Ar-ras> questpc do you have jsfiddle example?
[01:26:15] <retrostyle|15> nope i will test i :)
[01:26:24] <ihnru> Cork: can you clarify way #1 pls?
[01:26:32] <QuestPC> Ar-ras: Ok, I'll try to create jsfiddle example.
[01:26:39] <retrostyle|15> im new in json and jquery
[01:26:58] <Cork> ihnru: in your code you define everything inside a function or a prototype structure, later you invoke it as a function call
[01:27:13] <QuestPC> Ar-ras: This will take some time, I'll write you later. Thanks for the answers.
[01:27:54] <Cork> damn my home router died...
[01:28:00] <coldhead> oh no!
[01:28:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Good morning Queryans
[01:28:17] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: Beat it with a stick, that usually works
[01:28:32] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: i don't have a stick long enough
[01:28:44] <Cork> it would have to be ca 10 km long :)
[01:28:46] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: That's what she said
[01:28:57] <Ar-ras> ^^
[01:29:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Sorry, that was too easy to let go... I'll go smack myself later
[01:29:24] <xec> haha you were a bit late with that and made it entirely gross
[01:30:00] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY- did it help?
[01:30:03] <ChrisTheSorcerer> What? 10km is a decent size, isn't it? Anyway, I'm guessing you're not at home and need to access your home comp?
[01:31:07] <Ar-ras> good we use metric system here
[01:31:08] <Ar-ras> :)
[01:31:59] <fRAiLtY-> Ar-ras: The fiddle works, but for some odd reason it doesn't int he page, check http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/ and hover "Browse Products" I don't get any JS errors
[01:32:51] <ihnru> Cork:  So you how do you pass a URL with _s and &s and ?s and /s and ;s to the server in a GET param?
[01:33:05] <ChrisTheSorcerer> fRAiLtY-: What was it supposed to do when hovering it?
[01:33:21] <fRAiLtY-> ChrisTheSorcerer: Fade in/out slowly as you hover over/off
[01:33:23] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY- i see i made a mistake. it the menu should be still visible as long as you are in that div field too
[01:33:33] <fRAiLtY-> The menu it displays I mean
[01:34:53] <Cork> ihnru: have a bit of a problem to parse the question, but i think the answer is yes
[01:35:08] <xec> fRAiLtY-: i get a "b is undefined" error in console, seems to originate in the cycle plugin call
[01:35:33] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY- http://jsfiddle.net/qRJbD/19/
[01:35:56] <xec> ihnru: you escape it?
[01:36:11] <ihnru> Cork:  So you how do you pass a URL with lots of special chars to the server in a GET param?
[01:36:31] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY- annnd i forgot the necessary stop() http://jsfiddle.net/qRJbD/20/
[01:36:40] <ihnru> xec: The URL is in a var.
[01:36:42] <Cork> ihnru: ?v1=&v2=...
[01:37:40] <ChrisTheSorcerer> ihnru: I believe there's a url-encode function that makes a string URL coded (%xx-kinda thing)
[01:37:44] <peiper> is it possible to use .find to find an element with class xy ?
[01:38:33] <Ar-ras> peiper .find( selector )
[01:38:35] <xec> Cork: i think he wants to send an entire url as a string, hence my "escape it?" comment
[01:39:00] <peiper> Ar-ras, and how do i search for a class in a selector?
[01:39:52] <peiper> Ar-ras, got it alraedy
[01:39:55] <peiper> dumb me >_<
[01:39:59] <peiper> thanks anyway!
[01:40:03] <Ar-ras> ^^
[01:42:55] <ircjsbot> c0defr3ak i think my divs are up to something
[01:43:32] <fRAiLtY-> Grrr! http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/ illegal unexpected token apparently? Where?!
[01:43:43] <fRAiLtY-> I've removed all spaces and breaks, then reformatted
[01:43:46] <fRAiLtY-> No change
[01:44:48] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you've checked line 137?
[01:44:58] <Cork> or rather 137-138
[01:45:02] <Cork> *136
[01:45:43] <ihnru> Alright, so <script type="text/javascript">var u=encodeURIComponent('http://host.org/~username/w/index.php?title=Title_val&action=edit')</script><script type="text/javascript" src="host.org/path/to/script.js.php?u=?????How do i include u's value here?????"></script>
[01:45:45] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: 137 is just </script>
[01:45:58] <Cork> ya, but its the line that throws the error
[01:46:17] <Ar-ras> maybe some invisible character?
[01:47:36] <fRAiLtY-> Ah, wasn't even on that line! Was at the start of the script tag, a rogue space. Even so, it doesn't fade :( http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/ when hovering Browse Products
[01:47:40] <Cork> Ar-ras: thats what the error says
[01:48:04] <Ar-ras> Cork this channel is too fast
[01:48:49] <Ar-ras> I am watching Ghost Whisperer on tv and too lazy to change the channel. how do you think i could be fast enough for this channel?
[01:49:00] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you have another error in your code
[01:49:19] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Where? Chrome JS console doesn't show one?
[01:49:21] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: but it crashes inside jquery, so a none minimized version is needed to tell what
[01:49:30] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Ar-ras: Practice multi-tasking by reading the channel and listen to Ghost Whisperer?
[01:49:32] <Cork> [10:48:02.258] b is undefined @ http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/skin/frontend/default/helloboginya/js/jquery-1.5.2.min.js:16
[01:49:49] <Cork> goodluck reading that line :)
[01:49:58] <Whirl3d> evening all. How does one check to see if a plugin is loaded? Like, say, BBQ ? if (!$.bbq) {do something?}  ?
[01:50:26] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: thats why you should always use a none minimized jquery version when your developing
[01:50:46] <Ar-ras> ChrisTheSorcerer i am trying.
[01:51:58] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I've swapped to non-minified
[01:53:45] <fRAiLtY-> Still can't understand why Chrome JS thingy doesn't show me that :x
[01:54:00] <Ar-ras> what should it show?
[01:54:03] <Ar-ras> browse products?
[01:54:04] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: its the cycle script that crashes
[01:54:08] <Cork> $slider is empty
[01:55:39] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: $slider is a JS var?
[01:55:49] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY- well the buttonmenu works for me
[01:56:06] <fRAiLtY-> Ar-ras: It works, but doesn't fade like i want it to, like the fiddle
[01:56:07] <Cork> oh wait its in your code
[01:56:14] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: line 1380 in the html file
[01:56:16] <fRAiLtY-> Just off/on via CSS
[01:56:29] <Cork> $.fn.cycle.commonReset(curr,next,opts); curr == undefined
[01:56:39] <Cork> next too
[01:56:54] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY- you didnt put the showMenu into buttonmenu
[01:57:08] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY-thats why it dont fades
[01:57:21] <fRAiLtY-> Ar-ras: What do you mean sorry?
[01:57:43] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: What HTML is around that line as I'm using Magento so don't have 1 html file, I have thousands merged together
[01:57:47] <Ar-ras> i changed the code so that the hover out fades out your showmenu
[01:58:13] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY- and that is only possible if your showmenu is inside buttonmenu
[01:58:21] <Ar-ras> look the jsfiddle
[01:58:34] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: bleh... sorry my debugger got tricked
[01:58:43] <fRAiLtY-> Ar-ras: gotcha
[01:58:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: its 138 in cycle.all.js
[01:58:50] <Cork> *1380
[02:01:29] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY- that was easier to realize the mouse out, because if it is not sub element, you have to set a mousemove on bodytag and check if your button contains the event.target etc. etc.
[02:01:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: and.. it case caused by the twitter jsonp not getting loaded; sorry for the waist of time
[02:02:37] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: What debugger do you use as my Chrome one is shit obviously
[02:02:52] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the original :)
[02:02:54] <Cork> firebug
[02:03:12] <Cork> anyway the crash was caused by domain access blockage
[02:03:35] <Cork> so its not a problem with the site except posibly that it doesn't check that the pull worked
[02:03:39] <Ar-ras> fRAiLtY- everybody here should get a free printed t-shirt for this suppoert
[02:03:40] <poppiez> I'm having problems with chromium on mac. I have a div with a background image which has loaded. if I replace the div with a new div with the same background image a few seconds after it has been cached, it flashes. like it's slow to retrieve the image from the cache
[02:03:46] <poppiez> anyone knows about this?
[02:03:59] <fRAiLtY-> Cheers all
[02:04:05] <Ar-ras> poppiez what is chromium?
[02:04:09] <Ar-ras> :D
[02:04:16] <poppiez> Ar-ras: chrome ;)
[02:04:29] <Cork> googles opensource browser
[02:04:37] <Cork> chrome is the closed source version
[02:04:42] <Ar-ras> it sounds linke that IE6 bug where you have to set the caching time in the htaccess :O
[02:04:57] <poppiez> Cork: err, didn't know that. it's chrome then
[02:04:58] <Ar-ras> didnt know that chome on mac is called chromium
[02:05:16] <Cork> Ar-ras: it doesn't
[02:05:28] <poppiez> anyway :D
[02:05:40] <Cork> chromium is the one the comunity works on and its whats opensource, it exists for all platforms
[02:06:00] <poppiez> seems related to: http://support.dev7studios.com/discussions/nivo-slider/561-flashing-before-transitions-in-mac-chrome/page/1
[02:06:05] <Cork> then google pulls what they like from chromium tweekthings and adds a few closed source stuff and call it chrome
[02:07:06] <Cork> its the same structure as fedora > redhat
[02:08:28] <Ar-ras> Cork are you sure? but how about chromium on windows?
[02:08:35] <Cork> same
[02:08:36] <Ar-ras> i meant chrome
[02:08:43] <Cork> ^
[02:08:57] <Cork> chrome is the closed source google branded browser
[02:09:05] <Ar-ras> those suckers
[02:09:08] <Cork> chromium is the opensource project
[02:09:42] <Cork> its also why chrome has h.264 bundeld while chromium only supports it if the os has support
[02:09:49] <Cork> and flash)
[02:09:54] <Ar-ras> hmm
[02:09:58] <Cork> and auto updater
[02:10:34] <Cork> (you can't have h264 support bundled with opensource)
[02:10:39] <Ar-ras> i know
[02:10:53] <Ar-ras> for that we have gladly webm
[02:11:00] <Cork> we don't
[02:11:04] <Ar-ras> not?
[02:11:08] <Ar-ras> ogg?
[02:11:09] <Cork> webm died ca 2months ago
[02:11:14] <Cork> na
[02:11:14] <Ar-ras> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[02:11:23] <Cork> its 264 or scew you
[02:11:24] <Ar-ras> R.I.P. WebM
[02:11:31] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Ok, I need to go over to another channel. See you guys later!
[02:11:32] <mnemoc> o_O
[02:11:47] <Cork> when mozilla moved to support 264 webm and vorbis on the net died
[02:12:02] <mnemoc> :(
[02:12:26] <woerc> hello :D
[02:12:32] <Ar-ras> hi
[02:12:40] <Ar-ras> how are you woerc
[02:12:52] <woerc> fine thx : D
[02:13:14] <woerc> i have a small jquery problem ^^
[02:13:27] <Nece228> hello
[02:13:44] <Nece228> im wondernig can i store variable data and later retrieve it with php
[02:13:58] <Cork> you can't
[02:14:00] <Ar-ras> you mean like a cookie?
[02:14:03] <Nece228> something like it would store to get or post, and then with php i could retrieve
[02:14:05] <Cork> you need to send them to the server
[02:14:09] <Nece228> no i just meant to store data
[02:14:15] <woerc> i have the form var and i wanna append an element to the table inner the form, but how can i achieve it?
[02:14:17] <Nece228> yeah, how to send them?
[02:14:31] <Cork> Nece228: $.post ?
[02:14:33] <Ar-ras> Nece228 with ajax
[02:14:46] <Cork> ?.post @ Nece228
[02:14:46] <bot-t> Nece228, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[02:15:07] <Nece228> but i dont need to load data from the server
[02:15:12] <Nece228> i need to send it to the server
[02:15:19] <Fratyr> maybe html5's local storage?
[02:15:20] <xec> it does both
[02:15:21] <Cork> Nece228: its the same thing :)
[02:15:30] <Fratyr> not sure if it's accessible via server tho
[02:15:32] <Nece228> oh ok, thanks im gonna try
[02:15:36] <Ar-ras> woerc $('<input type="hidden" value="1" name="id" />').appendTo($('div', 'form'));
[02:15:37] <Cork> Nece228: the difference is that you don't send any thing but an oj
[02:15:38] <Cork> *ok
[02:15:50] <woerc> form.prepend(select); works, but i want it in the table, but form(#table).prepend(select) doesnt work :D ^^
[02:16:19] <Ar-ras> form.children('#table').prepend(select)
[02:16:37] <woerc> oh this looks great i test it :D
[02:17:33] <Nece228> hmm
[02:17:39] <Nece228> im wondernig how the syntax will look
[02:18:14] <Cork> $.post('url, { dataToSend:['comes', 'here'], true })
[02:18:20] <Cork> opps
[02:18:28] <Ar-ras> dataToSend?
[02:18:38] <Cork> just variable names :)
[02:18:47] <Cork> should have been one infront of true too
[02:19:10] <woerc> ah, nearly, i have 2 tables in the form
[02:19:18] <woerc> so i have 2 specify it rightß
[02:19:29] <Ar-ras> woerc or drop 1 table
[02:19:52] <woerc> :D ^^ jqgrid i dont wanna drop anything :D
[02:20:17] <Ar-ras> well than you have specify ;)
[02:21:13] <woerc> so can do a form.children(#table.tablename).append(bla)
[02:22:31] <Nece228> Cork: correct? $.post("#, {dataToSend:['match'], true}");
[02:23:25] <Ar-ras> woerc yes, but i hope you dont use <table> for that
[02:23:56] <woerc> thx a lot :D ill do my best :D
[02:24:42] <Ar-ras> woerc btw. you can do form.chidren('table').first().append()
[02:26:07] <Cork> Nece228: no
[02:26:24] <Nece228> thats what i thought
[02:26:25] <Nece228> heh
[02:26:39] <Cork> Nece228: first argument is the url, the second is an object {} with key:value paris
[02:26:44] <Cork> *pairs
[02:27:16] <Cork> Nece228: whats in the object ends up in $_POST[] in the server script
[02:27:32] <Nece228> ok
[02:28:34] <Nece228> damn i really need to learn ajax
[02:28:55] <QuestPC> Ar-ras: I made the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Adnmf/
[02:28:58] <Cork> Nece228: think of it as submitting a form in an iframe
[02:29:04] <Cork> Nece228: not really much difference
[02:29:38] <woerc> nice, it works nearly
[02:29:40] <QuestPC> Ar-ras: inner div click handler should scroll outer div so inner div will stay at top of window, but it does not work
[02:30:02] <woerc> just have the problem that in the table, is a tbody, and i dont know how 2 tell him
[02:30:20] <QuestPC> Ar-ras: top of window = top of visible area of overflowed outer div
[02:30:21] <woerc> that he append this IN the tbody not just in the table
[02:32:51] <QuestPC> Anyone knows why click handler does not vertically scroll inner div at top visible position? http://jsfiddle.net/Adnmf/
[02:34:54] <rethus> i have a php class, which handle imagemackif functions to create thumbs.
[02:35:23] <rethus> cause the creation of a whole folder are take much time, i wan't to call it via ajax.
[02:35:43] <rethus> is there a way to access with jquery-ajax to a method inside of a php-class?
[02:36:05] <rethus> or have i to create a normal function in a seperated php-file, without "class"-Context?
[02:38:23] <Cork> rethus: no
[02:38:39] <Cork> ajax access "resources"(urls)
[02:38:54] <Cork> so its up to the server how that is handled in code
[02:39:49] <Acrack> Cork
[02:39:51] <Acrack> still here ? ^^
[02:39:56] <faraway> rethus: take a look at e.g. json-rpc  Zend has e.g. a Zend_Json_Server
[02:39:56] <rethus> but to fire my class, i have to use an additional php-file, wich do all the "class init-Stuff" inside
[02:40:35] <Cork> rethus: either that or do different things based on a param
[02:40:45] <Cork> Acrack: apperntly :)
[02:41:04] <Acrack> sec phone :x
[02:41:28] <QuestPC> Anyone knows why click handler does not vertically scroll inner div at top visible position? http://jsfiddle.net/Adnmf/
[02:44:23] <Cork> QuestPC: do you have the scrollTo plugin loaded where you run this?
[02:45:49] <Acrack> back yep Cork i got difficult problem for you :D
[02:46:03] <Cork> :)
[02:46:08] <Acrack> remember that .click we did with answerid
[02:46:19] <Cork> sure
[02:46:24] <Acrack> seems i can use that function just for a moment
[02:46:44] <Acrack> then i can't click anymore, i mean if i click nothing happen
[02:46:47] <Acrack> and no error
[02:46:49] <Cork> Acrack: use the on handler i showed you instead of the clock
[02:46:52] <Acrack> here is my whole code
[02:46:52] <Acrack> http://pastie.org/3803365
[02:47:07] <Cork> $(document).on('click', '.good-answer', function() {})
[02:47:18] <Acrack> k sec
[02:47:20] <Cork> clock==click
[02:47:55] <QuestPC> Cork: Yes I do have scrollTo plugin in my MediaWiki extension. How can load it in jsfiddle?
[02:47:56] <Zogot> Cork: Is it not a bad idea to attach an .on to the document?
[02:48:13] <Cork> Zogot: its the same as the old .live
[02:48:21] <Cork> a bit more optimized thought
[02:48:26] <Cork> *though
[02:48:30] <ChrisTheSorcerer> QuestPC: Click on Add Resources in the leftside toolbar
[02:48:44] <Zogot> Cork: Ah fair enough, I've always tried adding .on to a parent element instead of the whole document though.
[02:48:45] <QuestPC> ChrisTheSorcerer: thanks!
[02:48:51] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I think...
[02:49:10] <Cork> Zogot: thats by far the best, but i don't have the complete page; but i know document always exist :)
[02:49:19] <Zogot> Cork: hehe fair enough
[02:50:28] <ChrisTheSorcerer> QuestPC: Did you get it to work?
[02:51:00] <Acrack> yep Cork seems your code is better
[02:51:03] <Acrack> not bugging oO
[02:51:22] <QuestPC> ChrisTheSorcerer: On the second thought, it seems I do not have scrollTo plugin among MediaWiki resources. My mistake!
[02:51:27] <Cork> Acrack: your replacing your elements
[02:51:35] <QuestPC> ChrisTheSorcerer: No, still looking for scrollTo uri. 1 sec
[02:51:42] <Cork> Acrack: when you do that $().click doesn't know about the new elements
[02:51:47] <ChrisTheSorcerer> QuestPC: A mistake I have done many a-times ;)
[02:51:50] <Acrack> aaaah ok
[02:51:59] <QuestPC> ChrisTheSorcerer: :-)
[02:52:06] <Cork> Acrack: the new one binds on document and listens for bubbling events instead
[02:53:56] <Whirl3d> I think I found a need for implementing deferred's Could someone tell me if this makes sense? I have my content divided into sections and sections into pages. If a user requests a page that is not loaded yet in a section that is not current, I want to load the page, return a deferred object, that once the page is loaded, it shows the section (with the page displayed)
[02:54:56] <Cork> Whirl3d: callbacks, defered or an event sounds correct ya
[02:57:01] <Acrack> Cork i got a last problem with my code
[02:57:08] <QuestPC> ChrisTheSorcerer: Now it works, however the position of inner div is not exactly at top of visible area of outer div
[02:57:10] <Acrack> a problem with internet fucking explorer
[02:57:39] <Cork> nothing new there :)
[02:57:47] <Acrack> its same problem that previous one
[02:58:03] <Acrack> 2 user exchange messages
[02:58:18] <Acrack> they can see their messages but after some seconde
[02:58:25] <Acrack> IE stop receiving datas
[02:58:31] <ChrisTheSorcerer> QuestPC: I believe that is a problem that you can solve quite easilly with repositioning and trial&error. Great that you got the basics to work thou
[02:58:37] <Acrack> but if i write on IE, Firefox receive datas...
[02:58:49] <Cork> Acrack: what your using to create the data channel?
[02:59:12] <QuestPC> ChrisTheSorcerer: Sure, you are right, one should not be too lazy and release too much of responsibility on others. That one is me.
[02:59:24] <Acrack> the thing i sent you
[02:59:32] <Acrack> http://pastie.org/3803365
[02:59:55] <Acrack> its not really message, its a question module, people ask question, and other give answers
[03:00:19] <Acrack> i said message so you can get it faster :p ^^
[03:00:42] <Cork> ok so commet
[03:01:15] <Bartzy> What is the difference between $('#some_checkbox).prop('checked') vs $('#some_checkbox').is(':checked') ?
[03:01:24] <Acrack> the thing that get refreshed
[03:01:25] <Acrack> is
[03:01:29] <Cork> Acrack: can't tell what happens just by looking at the code
[03:01:35] <Acrack> divContent
[03:01:43] <Acrack> yy gonna explain :p
[03:01:45] <faraway> i asked this a few weeks before but i didn't get an answer, so i try again. can someone tell me what is wrong with this: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/Xm7vK/
[03:02:00] <Acrack> function loadChirp() this is the function
[03:02:04] <Bartzy> Acrack: What ?
[03:02:05] <Acrack> that refresh the loop
[03:02:19] <Cork> Acrack: what i mean is, i see how its meant to work, but i won't be able to guess what it is from just seeing the dead code
[03:02:27] <Bartzy> What is the difference ?
[03:02:40] <Acrack> Cork what information do you need mate ?
[03:02:46] <Cork> Bartzy: those two commands has nothing to do with eachother
[03:02:58] <Cork> Acrack: to be able to debug it i need to see the code live; sorry
[03:03:11] <Bartzy> Cork: I want to check the state of a checkbox (true should be if it's checked, false if not checked).
[03:03:26] <faraway> the selector works with find , but the it does not work for the ".on"
[03:03:28] <Bartzy> Cork: .is(':checked') is doing that.
[03:03:37] <Bartzy> Why use .prop('checked') and not .is ?
[03:03:45] <Cork> Bartzy: prop gives you access to properties on the element
[03:03:53] <Cork> is runs sizzle selectors
[03:04:03] <Bartzy> Cork: So it's a better fit for that check?
[03:04:14] <Cork> prop should be faster
[03:04:21] <Cork> thought it shouldn't matter for one element
[03:05:09] <Cork> Bartzy: but is and prop are two quite different things
[03:05:25] <Bartzy> Cork: Can you explain ?
[03:05:31] <Bartzy> I understand what each does
[03:05:33] <Bartzy> but for this specific case
[03:05:57] <Cork> is('div >.something[name="something')
[03:06:04] <Cork> * is('div >.something[name="something]')
[03:06:21] <Cork> but if all you want is :checked and nothing more, use prop
[03:07:55] <QuestPC> Bartzy: prop() seems to be speed optimization for very small subset of is()
[03:08:50] <QuestPC> is() is much more powerful but prop() is faster
[03:08:57] <Pallet> Hi all
[03:09:28] <Pallet> I'm still learning jQuery and Javascript
[03:09:48] <Cork> QuestPC: prop has NOTHING to do with is
[03:11:31] <Cork> prop looks throse the properties on the dom element
[03:12:00] <ML74> anyone good with PHP?
[03:12:01] <Cork> attr was split up into prop and attr in jquery 1.5
[03:12:11] <Cork> ML74: ##php
[03:12:17] <ML74> cheers Cok
[03:12:21] <ML74> *Cork
[03:12:35] <QuestPC> Cork: ok, sorry.
[03:13:08] <Cork> no need :)
[03:13:58] <ML74> "You need to identify with network services to join the room"
[03:14:04] <ML74> any idea what the problem is? :/
[03:14:40] <faraway> ML74: you need to register at free node and auth
[03:15:01] <ML74> faraway: how do i do that?
[03:15:40] <faraway> ML74: http://freenode.net/faq.shtml
[03:25:48] <DannyZB> Guys : where do I get someone to help out with an OpenSource project ?
[03:26:07] <DannyZB> I've always used opensource , never touched the development itself ><
[03:27:13] <pigiman> hey, when using $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: '0px'}, { ... , complete: function() { //dosomething } } , how can I know when the compelte function will be fired? since in Chrome the complete function will be fired twice while in other browsers it might happen only once (without knowing which HTML tag was the last one)
[03:31:54] <Whirl3d> pigiman, why would it fire twice in Chrome?
[03:32:04] <pigiman> I think it because
[03:32:08] <pigiman> html and body

[03:35:06] <faraway> pigiman: checking if the scrollTop on the event firing is 0 for html and body ?
[03:36:19] <d0ax> hello I`ve got problem with jsonp
[03:36:54] <d0ax> anybody know some detailed tutorial about that?
[03:43:06] <coolpro> Hello, does anyone use YoxView?
[03:46:18] <faraway> Cork: could you probably have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/Xm7vK/  ?
[03:47:42] <coolpro> I am just testing YoxView out.  This option: http://www.yoxigen.com/yoxview/demo/demo%20-%20thumbnails%20options%201.html and I basically copied the code out and uploaded to my server: http://www.bukauskas.eu/~solotck/norm.html and it's not working - I can't get the Youtube thumbnails to my page.
[03:52:44] <faraway> coolpro: did you try it with using query 1.4.2 probably the yoxview is not compatible with 1.7.2
[03:53:25] <quicksilver> faraway: I don't know for sure without checking the source, but I suspect that .on does not run the selector relatively, unlike .find
[03:53:30] <quicksilver> faraway: so the '>' is a problem.
[03:53:50] <StevenCodes> sup everyone
[03:54:12] <faraway> quicksilver: hmm .. is that something to be reported as bug ?
[03:54:25] <quicksilver> faraway: I don't know, the docs really aren't clear (to me, anyway) on what behaviour is expected.
[03:54:49] <quicksilver> would be interested in ajpiano's opinion when he's around.
[03:55:12] <quicksilver> faraway: is just removing that > acceptable for you? i.e. container1.on("mouseover",".child",function() ...
[03:55:18] <coolpro> faraway: I believe The YoxView loads jQuery on his own: http://pastebin.com/AHhVRg8T
[03:55:30] <Whirl3d> Hey StevensCodes
[03:55:40] <StevenCodes> Sup Whirl3d  How's ya day ?
[03:56:34] <faraway> quicksilver: no in the real usecase i have this elements nested … (in child there can be another container with childs an so on)
[03:57:13] <quicksilver> faraway: hmm, nod.
[03:57:45] <quicksilver> faraway: i don't know an answer then, except managing the delegation by hand :-( but I might be missing something.
[03:57:45] <Whirl3d> okay I suppose. Trying to figure out defferreds and promises
[03:57:46] <Bartzy> If anyone knows, in ColorBox, when loading the modal with 'html: my_html_to_show', I see a flickering of loading from the colorbox, than the actual content is shown. How can I disable that?
[03:57:46] <faraway> coolpro: i just saw that on the working test page 1.4.2 is used and on the not working one 1.7.2 thats why i was asking
[03:58:29] <faraway> quicksilver: currently i apply the event handler by hand for every added element, but with the .on handler it would be less code ;)
[03:59:01] <coolpro> faraway: oh, okay.  how do I attach the 1.4.2 to my html file?
[04:01:47] <quicksilver> faraway: yeah :(
[04:01:49] <faraway> coolpro: try to remove the line 30 in the html code where 1.7.2 is loaded probably then it loads the correct version itself. sorry i don't know yoxview so i can tell you more
[04:03:36] <quicksilver> faraway: really hard to google for information about bugs in jquery.on :)
[04:04:05] <faraway> quicksilver: it's for a a nested sortable list where elements can be dragged to other areas, so the .on would be much more robust, anyway i probably fill a bug report .. more then "i is not a bug" could not happen :D
[04:04:13] <quicksilver> faraway: yup.
[04:04:22] <quicksilver> faraway: "context element" is the technical term.
[04:04:42] <quicksilver> faraway: so "jquery.on doesn't appear to use the context element for the selector filter" or something like that
[04:04:58] <coolpro> faraway: thank you. Though, even if my page now looks exactly the same as in  the YoxView test page, it is not properly working.
[04:08:02] <quicksilver> faraway: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10800 seems to confirm that delegation uses ".is()" which doesn't takea  context.
[04:08:25] <pigiman> faraway: hey man ,sorry I had to go to a meeting
[04:08:35] <james13433> anyone know why this isn't working in chrome or safari/? width += $marker.outerWidth(true);
[04:08:44] <pigiman> so you're saying to check if my scroll got to 0 right?
[04:08:46] <james13433> but works in firefox
[04:08:47] <faraway> coolpro: hmm .. sorry don't have the time to debug the code, so can't help you right now
[04:09:41] <coolpro> faraway: it's ok. still thank you for helping me.
[04:11:30] <faraway> pigiman: don't know if that will work in your case, but you could try. it still could happen that on both invocations the scrollTop is 0 so you probably need a helper variable that you will only handle once
[04:12:31] <james13433> http://www.magento2.co.uk/whitebox if anyone wants to help
[04:15:57] <james13433> I think maybe its todo with the fact I havnt acutely appended it to the page at that point?
[04:16:39] <faraway> quicksilver: hmm .. do i understand context wrong, or should this updated code then not work: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/Xm7vK/ ?
[04:16:46] <Trisox> james13433: looks like css issue
[04:16:58] <Trisox> try setting position on the ol
[04:16:59] <james13433> Trisox, how so?
[04:17:35] <Trisox> http://www.alistapart.com/articles/taminglists/
[04:17:38] <quicksilver> faraway: yes, if you manually prevent the bubbling that might be enough.
[04:17:55] <james13433> works in firefox, the outerWidth of each one is returning as 0 not 96 like it should
[04:18:04] <quicksilver> faraway: erm not sure what your paste is trying to show, though :)
[04:18:05] <pigiman> faraway: yeah once I got to 0 I will set it up and Iwon't use my callback function anymore
[04:18:11] <pigiman> faraway: thanks I will try it
[04:18:17] <quicksilver> faraway: they're not nested inside each other so there is no problem...
[04:18:33] <Trisox> display inline on ol
[04:18:37] <Trisox> try that
[04:18:50] <Trisox> james13433
[04:19:35] <faraway> quicksilver: non with prevent default it works
[04:19:56] <faraway> quicksilver: i'm away for eating now
[04:20:05] <james13433> inline-block works but that causes other browser issues.
[04:20:28] <sunbeam> function(response) { // ..} in the php file that creates this reponse i do return $etc; but it doesn't display anything
[04:20:32] <sunbeam> it does when i echo $etc;
[04:20:33] <sunbeam> how come?
[04:21:02] <Trisox> james13433: this is pure css related nothing to do with jquery
[04:21:15] <james13433> Trisox, its not.
[04:21:29] <Soleino> Hello everybody, please i'm digging about something since yesterday
[04:21:58] <Trisox> sunbeamit is
[04:22:00] <Trisox> it is
[04:22:27] <Soleino> i didnt find the solution yet, i've something like http://pastebin.com/x0BdLGrt and i want to do something with ajax/jquery when i click on a radio bouton i have a sum calculated
[04:22:30] <james13433> If I set the width of the container element, to say 400 then it works, the problem is I need to get the overall width of the child elements to then set it to the right width, but its getting 0 as that width when we can both see they don't have a width of 0 at all Trisox
[04:22:40] <Soleino> earch radio buton have a price and is not in the value
[04:23:27] <Trisox> .css('width')  ?
[04:23:35] <Trisox> to get width's
[04:25:15] <james13433> well I need the whole width so was using .outerWidth(true).
[04:25:23] <Ottavio> salve
[04:25:28] <Ottavio> !list
[04:25:40] <james13433> Even if I don't choose to float them the problem still happenes so I can't see how its a css problem
[04:25:40] <sunbeam> function(response) { // ..} in the php file that creates this reponse i do return $etc; but it doesn't display anything
[04:25:46] <sunbeam> how come?
[04:26:41] <Cork> sunbeam: you need to echo the value
[04:26:53] <Ottavio> !list
[04:26:58] <Cork> sunbeam: response is the text in the response body
[04:27:07] <Cork> Ottavio: stop that, this isn't a bot channel
[04:27:13] <sunbeam> Cork: thanks!
[04:27:18] <james13433> Trisox, .css('width')  ? retuns 95px in firefox, 0px in chrome and safari
[04:27:55] <Cork> james13433: whats the display type of the elements?
[04:29:26] <james13433> good question, not sure I havnt set one, so..
[04:30:27] <Cork> whats the element type?
[04:30:33] <james13433> li
[04:30:43] <Cork> inline, inline doens't have width or height
[04:30:49] <Cork> set display: inline-block;
[04:31:51] <james13433> Really, why would it work in firefox then? I tried inline-block and block, with no luck.
[04:36:17] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Firefox have different coding than other browsers (or rather every browser is different). Where FF might be able to "anticipate" the coders intention, Chrome might take the code literally and IE might ignore it completely, in other cases IE might be flexible and Chrome and FF might have troubles...
[04:37:07] <james13433> right ok.
[04:40:11] <james13433> I i do alert('test = '+$('.bjqs-markers li.:eq(0)').outerWidth(true)); at the end I get the correct width, so much be cause its not been appended right?
[04:40:31] <soee> hi, how can i get some url params ?
[04:41:00] <soee> i using preventDefault() on anchor and now i want to get its params and operate on them
[04:41:20] <Cork> soee: regex
[04:43:11] <Cork> ?eval "http://example.com/url.html?param=1&s=text".match(/\?(.*)/) @ soee
[04:43:12] <james13433> intact something to do with the fact I'm using "$marker."
[04:43:14] <bot-t> soee: ["?param=1&s=text", "param=1&s=text"]
[04:44:41] <Soleino> html question can we add before value="something" a price="100" and retrieve it with jquery ?
[04:49:16] <quicksilver> Soleino: it's possible but not recommended.
[04:49:35] <quicksilver> Soleino: making up your own attributes violates the HTML standards and some browsers may not work smoothly with them.
[04:49:52] <rickibalboa> Soleino, HTML5 supports the data-* attribute
[04:50:05] <rickibalboa> So you can make up your own, jquery can edit it with .data() I believe.
[04:50:22] <quicksilver> if you're targetting HTML5, yes.
[04:50:35] <quicksilver> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/432174/how-to-store-arbitrary-data-for-some-html-tags
[04:51:23] <rickibalboa> Saying that, just reading up on .data() I don't think it uses the data attribute..
[04:51:57] <Sembiance> Another JS library, shownig benchmarks that leave jQuery in the dust: http://qatrix.com/benchmark
[04:52:10] <Sembiance> maybe some things could be learned from their code and optimizations could be made to jQuery?
[04:52:22] <nFFF> jquery speed shouldnt be your bottleneck
[04:56:58] <Soleino> please someone can help me ?
[04:57:41] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Soleino, if you read up, you'll see that 7 of the latest 9 posts was answers to your question
[05:00:48] <Wiggin> oh heyy ParanoidGal
[05:02:12] <Soleino> thanks ChrisTheSorcerer & rickibalboa, quicksilver
[05:02:51] <Soleino> my other question is i want this personal attribute to be calculated by jquery in another input and live calclulated
[05:05:48] <rickibalboa> Soleino, do you mean calulcated with a bunch of other elements that have the same attribute?
[05:05:58] <Soleino> exactly rickibalboa
[05:06:09] <rickibalboa> hold on
[05:06:53] <Soleino> if i used another attribute it's because i want to calculate the values, and receive a mail with something that i can understand value="no extra" for example
[05:06:57] <rickibalboa> Soleno, something similar to this? Different form obviously but similar in theory http://kcd.sytes.net/web_development/examples/simpleorderform.htm
[05:08:18] <rickibalboa> Well what I would do, is assign all these elements with a class, target them with $('.class') then loop through them, with .each(), grabbing the data value and adding them together
[05:08:31] <rickibalboa> you could put all this in a function and return the final value
[05:08:45] <Soleino> one second
[05:09:26] <Whirl3dOrd3r> Soleino, consider .map
[05:12:38] <Soleino> whirl3dOrd3r rickibalboa http://pastebin.com/8TMkpTHV
[05:13:20] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Soleino: I think it's easier if you use http://jsfiddle.net instead
[05:13:53] <Soleino> so what i want is to give to the visitor the live price when he checks radio boutons
[05:14:07] <Soleino> and for me receive a clear mail
[05:14:35] <Soleino> lol chrisTheSorcerer i used only html in pastebin not yet start jquery
[05:14:43] <Soleino> just tested some things but didnt work
[05:15:04] <rickibalboa> Soleno: Soemthing like this http://jsfiddle.net/5XT2r/
[05:15:09] <rickibalboa> soleino*
[05:15:31] <ThiefMaster> ugh
[05:15:35] <ThiefMaster> why not .data('price')
[05:15:40] <ThiefMaster> that will already be a number
[05:15:57] <rickibalboa> could use that yeah, but his html has the price assigned to the element
[05:16:08] <Soleino> i can change my html
[05:16:29] <rickibalboa> you'll have to assign the price with jquery before hand, also my example will only work with HTML5, or only be valid with HTML5, up to you really.
[05:16:34] <Soleino> if there is a clean way instead of personal attribute
[05:16:37] <ThiefMaster> wrong
[05:16:42] <ThiefMaster> data-* works for .data()
[05:16:55] <ThiefMaster> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[05:16:59] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Thought of using ID's on the radio buttons and then set the price in the script instead? That way you can change the price there if it ever changes in the future
[05:17:02] <ThiefMaster> err, http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[05:17:24] <ThiefMaster> having to change your scripts due to a price change is pretty nasty
[05:18:20] <Soleino> dudes its only a very ver small page :)
[05:18:31] <rickibalboa> oh does it? I didn't realise, well there you go, use .data
[05:18:36] <Soleino> and prices will not change for a while
[05:18:52] <pigiman> faraway: : seems that $('html').scrollTop() is always equals to zero in Chrome (probably Webkit but I didn't check) : \
[05:19:01] <Soleino> data instead of what ?
[05:19:13] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Well, no matter how you do it, with HTML and JS, you need to change it somehow. I just find it easier to change in the script than in some customly made tag in the HTML
[05:19:13] <ThiefMaster> .data(' instead of .attr('data-
[05:19:16] <rickibalboa> .attr('data-price'), just use .data('price')
[05:19:26] <Soleino> is there a good video/book for html 5 ? i'm already good in html 4.1 css2/3
[05:21:26] <ChrisTheSorcerer> don't have flash on this comp, but this one got good ranks: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdDc7sWjCL4
[05:22:55] <Soleino> code here doesnt work with my radio buttons http://jsfiddle.net/5XT2r/
[05:25:59] <Xotix> hi
[05:26:10] <Wiggin> hi
[05:26:12] <Soleino> http://jsfiddle.net/5XT2r/1/ so how to change live the total when i click on radio butons ?
[05:26:15] <dualcore> hellooo
[05:26:34] <Wiggin> what troubles you, Xotix
[05:27:08] <Xotix> if i havea plugin which has var settings = {'foo':''}. I use it on one div and set foo to bar. Then i use it on a second element, is foo still set?
[05:27:16] <faraway> pigiman: not sure but for scrolling the window content you could use $(window)
[05:27:54] <Wiggin> Xotix: umm would depend on the plugin and what it does?
[05:30:54] <faraway> pigiman: sorry , that only works for direct read and set.
[05:30:59] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Soleino: You need to check if the radio button is selected first
[05:31:05] <pachet> Xotix: Wiggin speaks truth, it depends entirely on the plugin
[05:31:30] <Xotix> Wiggin, an var within my plugin just lives as long as I'm within the scope, right? When i return or reach the end, it get's lost. Imagen a simple plugin, just a setting obj and return this. :P
[05:31:58] <Wiggin> …buh?
[05:32:19] <Wiggin> okay uhm
[05:32:24] <Wiggin> from what I can guess
[05:32:33] <rickibalboa> Soleino, yeah you need to check if it's selected, then return the values of the selected ones.
[05:32:39] <rickibalboa> calculate them, rather.
[05:33:27] <Cork> Soleino: http://jsfiddle.net/5XT2r/2/
[05:33:29] <rickibalboa> Soleino, http://jsfiddle.net/5XT2r/3/
[05:33:31] <rickibalboa> xD
[05:33:36] <Wiggin> Xotix you're doing something like this: $(document).ready(function(){settings={'foo'};    $("#somediv".applyPlugin(settings); });
[05:33:37] <Wiggin> ?
[05:33:48] <Wiggin> whoops missing a close paren after somediv
[05:33:53] <pigiman> faraway: thats not good :|
[05:34:14] <pachet> Xotix: no - a plugin is essentially a property method on the jquery object
[05:34:20] <faraway> pigiman: but why not just only using body ? is html required for IE ?
[05:34:24] <pachet> as long as you retain reference to $ you can preserve state
[05:34:42] <pigiman> Opera and IE I think
[05:35:13] <Soleino> works good ^^
[05:35:51] <Soleino> thank you Cork, rickibalboa
[05:35:54] <Soleino> Very much
[05:38:39] <Xotix> pachet i i meant this http://jsfiddle.net/7nUPy/
[05:38:41] <pigiman> ** faraway:  Opera and IE I think
[05:39:10] <faraway> pigiman: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/HBBRe/  will this solve the problem ?
[05:40:01] <faraway> pigiman: you should probably choose another name for the function cause of name conflicts :D
[05:42:19] <faraway> pigiman: and correct the typos ;)
[05:46:32] <Wiggin> Xotix: what do you mean by         //merge _settings with settings ?
[05:47:02] <Wiggin> if you mean to check if _settings was null, and if so using settings instead then yeah, it should work
[05:47:52] <Wiggin> and yes, the settings variable should be scoped so you're probably safe
[05:47:58] <Wiggin> (emphasis on probably)
[05:49:16] <pigiman> faraway: thats what I did, the problem is that the first time is not promising that scrollOffest is 0 for sure
[05:49:41] <Soleino> Cork, rickibalboa is $('input.total').val(total); correct ?
[05:49:48] <pigiman> so I though if (!triggered and offest==0) then triggered = true but with 'html' selector it will make some problems
[05:50:07] <rickibalboa> Soleino, sure
[05:51:05] <faraway> pigiman: you want that your callback is only called only once per animate right?
[05:52:12] <Xotix> Wiggin $.extend
[05:52:29] <Wiggin> ah
[05:52:38] <Whirl3d> Xotix, $.extend({},defaults, opts);
[05:53:52] <Whirl3d> Xotix, and then there is some discussion about where to define "defaults". Some believe that it should be defined within the plugin function, some say outside of the plugin function (inside it's closure);
[05:54:12] <pachet> ^
[05:54:22] <pachet> depends on if you want your bound elems to share state :0
[05:55:07] <Xotix> Whirl3d:  If you put it outside, you have to reete it don't you, so why should you make it? If you put it into the plugin it  get's "reseted" by default
[05:55:27] <faraway> pigiman: what will not work with this? http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/HBBRe/
[05:55:32] <Xotix> pachet thanks
[05:55:33] <Whirl3d> Putting it outside the function ensures that it is always the same
[05:56:01] <Whirl3d> putting it inside the function allows you to pass "defaults", {newobject} and redefine the defaults going forward
[05:56:27] <pachet> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/pVjTQ/
[05:57:02] <Fratyr> any photoshop related channels on this server? :)
[05:57:37] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Is there any method I can use to flash time forward 3 hours? :P
[05:57:59] <pachet> ChrisTheSorcerer: mescaline
[05:58:25] <ChrisTheSorcerer> pachet: That would counter the morphine I took earlier
[05:58:30] <Whirl3d> Fratyr, pm me and I cam probably help
[05:59:57] <pigiman> faraway: becuase with Chrome 'html' fires first right? but it doesn't mean that 'body' scroll offest is 0
[06:00:44] <schoppenhauer> Hello. I have a rather lengthy deep tree which I would like to include using jsTree, jquery file tree or whatever. My problem with jsTree is that I do not quite get how to realize recursive ondemand-loading
[06:01:05] <schoppenhauer> that is, I see that it is possible to load children of a tree ondemand using the ajax-argument (though I did not try it yet)
[06:01:26] <schoppenhauer> but I do not see how I can add such parent nodes into something that is loaded via ajax already.
[06:01:46] <schoppenhauer> that is, have a tree node with children loaded via ajax inside a tree node with children loaded via ajax
[06:01:57] <pigiman> faraway: I think I will use it anyway, the only thing I found is a script http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/01/03/scrolling-to-the-top-and-bottom-with-jquery/ but I think its pretty much the same idea
[06:07:42] <faraway> pigiman: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/HBBRe/  ?
[06:08:34] <pigiman> faraway: hehe funny I did it in first place, then consult with my colleague about it and we thought what will happen if 'html' or 'body' will only work? then 2 has no meaning right?
[06:08:39] <pigiman> :)
[06:08:47] <pigiman> but please fix me if I`m wrong
[06:09:30] <faraway> pigiman: both are "animated", even if they property that is animated will not have an effect, and the callback will be called for both after the animation time
[06:10:10] <pigiman> faraway: it does make sense (what you're saying)
[06:11:58] <faraway> pigiman: and cause the callbacks are called after the time you set the error with using the bool like in the previous example would in the range of some ms if there is any at all, so i would prefer the one with the boolean
[06:12:45] <schoppenhauer> I have read http://groups.google.com/group/jstree/browse_thread/thread/98f23ff6e7722262?pli=1 but what should I give as a "children"-parameter?
[06:12:54] <schoppenhauer> and: does this work recursively?
[06:16:39] <rethus> how can i set a var like "submitted" via submit() on jquery?
[06:17:47] <faraway> rethus: you "submit" your form to another target (iframe)
[06:18:09] <faraway> ?
[06:18:20] <rethus> no, same one
[06:18:33] <Whirl3d> schoppenhauer, what is the command you are using to instantiate jstree
[06:19:00] <rethus> faraway: if i use pure html, and add submit button with name submitted, i got the var in POST (php)
[06:19:12] <rethus> how can i act to have such var via submit() jequery
[06:19:24] <pigiman> faraway: I agree, Iv used the boolean way, seems its working well so I will leave it as is till the bugs will come again :) thanks mate
[06:20:38] <Xotix> add a new input element fo the form or you $.post (the choice if you want to use ajax) there you can pass a map of vars
[06:21:53] <rethus> is there now way to add some value via the sumbit()-function to past to php script?
[06:22:31] <faraway> rethus: sorry. don't understand the problem.if you submit the form and the php script is called you already know that it is submitted !?
[06:22:56] <Whirl3d> rethus, using jquery you can prevent the submit action from happening
[06:22:56] <rethus> i have a button-toolbar wit 3 buttons.
[06:23:04] <Whirl3d> then you add the value and manually submit
[06:23:06] <Xotix> He wants to add a nvar to the post
[06:23:25] <rethus> beatified with bootstrp-twitter, so i have to use <button> tag even for the "download-button, who is the submit-button
[06:23:44] <rethus> for now i do $('#download').submit();
[06:23:55] <rethus> this submit my download-form
[06:24:48] <rethus> but i need to get a $POST['submitted'] var in my php-script, only if the download-botton (and not the other two buttons) are pressed
[06:24:49] <Whirl3d> $("form").on("submit", function (e) { e.preventDefault();   change your paramters then manually submit the form using ajax });
[06:25:41] <cybuch> Hello. I've got simple horizontal slider, anybody know how can I display its values on 'vintage' or 'old school' display?
[06:26:15] <Whirl3d> $("form").on("submit", function (e) { if $(e.target).is(".downloadButton") { add Submitted to teh post statement}; $.ajax....
[06:26:31] <Whirl3d> just make sure you e.preventDefault()
[06:26:32] <gnarf> Whirl3d: i don't think form submit has the button as target
[06:26:55] <Whirl3d> Seriously?
[06:27:07] <Whirl3d> So you would capture the submit on the buttons?
[06:27:09] <gnarf> what i would do is $(".downloadButton").click( function() { $("<input type='hidden' name='submitted' value='download'>").appendTo("form"); })
[06:27:24] <gnarf> or something similar
[06:27:49] <Xotix> I'd add a hidden input to the form and change it's val depending on which btn was clicked.
[06:28:20] <Whirl3d> what is the e.target of a submit event on a form?
[06:28:31] <gnarf> Whirl3d: the form
[06:28:45] <gnarf> Xotix: ++
[06:29:49] <mrHat> ok, how do i attach an click event to a newly created dom node
[06:30:36] <gnarf> hrm, quick 75 rep today: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10192052/91914 ;)
[06:32:04] <mrHat> anyone ?
[06:33:55] <gnarf> mrHat: the same way you attach an event to any dom node?  select it with jQuery and attach the event
[06:34:07] <mrHat> so i'm attaching a list of anchors using html() how do i get the title attr of the clicked anchor.
[06:34:23] <gnarf> if you want to to be "automatically" attached, it just doesn't work like that
[06:34:30] <mrHat> no
[06:34:33] <gnarf> you might want to consider using a "delegated" event on a container
[06:34:49] <mrHat> hmm
[06:34:54] <gnarf> like if contain.html( bunchOfATags )
[06:34:58] <gnarf> and some point before that
[06:35:01] <mrHat> pffft
[06:35:06] <mrHat> that would be crazt
[06:35:08] <mrHat> crazy
[06:35:09] <amirite> does anyone use javascript mvc
[06:35:11] <amirite> jvmc
[06:35:16] <gnarf> contain.on( "click", "a", function( e ) { });
[06:36:05] <gnarf> that works by trapping any click events inside "contain" - and it looks at what you clicked on (and its parents) for something matching the selector "a"
[06:36:37] <mrHat> but will that also see the newly attached elements ?
[06:37:04] <gnarf> mrHat: yes - because it doesn't actually attach an event to any elements inside contain
[06:37:35] <gnarf> it just listens for a click event to "bubble up" to the container, and then checks to see if there was an "a" tag in the chain
[06:37:46] <mrHat> hmm
[06:37:48] <mrHat> nice
[06:37:50] <frontendloader> Is there any sort of best practice for doing an intentional XSS? I want to obtain (using a bookmarklet) some json from another site from users that use that site, and then have that bookmarklet post that json data to my site.
[06:38:02] <coolpro> http://www.bukauskas.eu/solotck/norm.html   - can anyone tell what's wrong with it?
[06:38:57] <frontendloader> That sounds pretty malicious when I put it like that eh
[06:39:10] <mrHat> thanks gnarf :)
[06:39:41] <schoppenhauer> Whirl3d: I do not instatiate it yet, I am trying to find out which one to use
[06:40:33] <schoppenhauer> Whirl3d: so far, I am just looking for whether what I want to do is possible or not
[06:41:00] <Xotix> Can't i .append(div..).attr('id','foo')?
[06:42:28] <pachet> Xotix: sure, but you're setting the id of the parent
[06:42:42] <Whirl3d> I don't think append changes scope. $("something").append(somethingelse).attr("id","new") will make "something" into "new"
[06:43:27] <pachet> ^ it definitely doesn't change scope
[06:43:42] <Xotix> ok
[06:43:58] <Whirl3d> but $("div...").appendTo("someting").attr("id","new"). would work for you, I think
[06:45:18] <saml> hey, are you good at jquery?
[06:45:30] <pachet> no one here is
[06:45:36] <pachet> are you? we've been waiting so long for someone who is
[06:46:03] <Xotix> Whirl3d: hmm ok
[06:46:05] <saml> keep up practicing, you'll be good
[06:46:30] <saml> so I have <input type="checkbox">  what event do I listen for changing checked state?
[06:46:36] <pachet> saml: maybe you can help me, i'm having a hard time with the jquery.sarcastic plugin
[06:46:46] <pachet> saml: change
[06:46:56] <Xotix> saml i'd guess change?
[06:46:56] <saml> pachet, thanks. you are ruby on rails rockstar!
[06:50:53] <Xotix> I'm playing around, http://jsfiddle.net/Hv7Gq/1/ why does the function within bind get triggered?
[06:52:14] <Whirl3d> Xotix, if you say var x=$(someting).....then you can use x.attr()  because it is already the jquery object
[06:52:35] <coolpro> Uncaught TypeError: Property 'children' of object #<HTMLDivElement> is not a function - what could it be wrong?
[06:53:34] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Xotix: I don't know the fix, but the new button doesn't get an ID, so your ID lock doesn't work...
[06:53:41] <ThiefMaster> besides that, i'd use .prop() to set an id
[06:53:44] <Xotix> Whirl3d so HtmlBodyElement is jQuery?
[06:53:59] <Trisox> Xotix: you make my browser crash i clicked 5 times fast
[06:53:59] <ThiefMaster> i don't think .append() returns the appended element
[06:54:17] <ThiefMaster> var x = $('<button type="button">Create another Btn</button>').appendTo('body');
[06:54:20] <Xotix> The new button get's an Id. " btns are created with the same id, that's why it grows exponatial.
[06:54:40] <rethus> is tehre a easy way to show a progressbar for file which is still in download-state?
[06:54:41] <pachet> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/dhPbC/
[06:55:17] <xec> coolpro: i'm gonna guess you're trying to use a DOM element as if it was a jQuery collection
[06:55:24] <ThiefMaster> or even better: $('<button/>', {id:'foo'+count, text: 'create another button'}).on('click', createBtn).appendTo('body')
[06:55:52] <coolpro> xec: I'm using YoxView
[06:55:54] <pachet> zz, chaining is so ugly
[06:55:59] <Trisox> :D
[06:56:03] <pachet> and slows down debug time
[06:56:10] <Xotix> So i really need to read about appendTo. thanks
[06:56:16] <xec> coolpro: what on earth is that. do you have a live url?
[06:56:35] <Trisox> ? YoxView
[06:56:42] <coolpro> www.bukauskas.eu/solotck/norm.html as in http://www.yoxigen.com/yoxview/demo/demo%20-%20thumbnails%20options%201.html
[06:56:48] <Trisox> http://www.yoxigen.com/yoxview/
[06:56:50] <bot-t> Trisox, Download - Plugins - jQuery - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/yoxview
[06:57:37] <Trisox> nah i always use jquery ui dialog :)
[06:58:00] <Trisox> i'm off
[07:01:14] <coolpro> xec: When I'm linking to their yoxview-init.js file ( www.bukauskas.eu/solotck/norm2.html ), it is half-working. When I link to a downloaded file on my server I got "Uncaught TypeError: Property 'children' of object #<HTMLDivElement> is not a function"  in jquery.yoxview-2.21.min.js:96
[07:05:03] <xec> coolpro: sorry, never tried yoxview before. looks like you basically copypasted the demo?
[07:06:28] <coolpro> xec: that is correct. I tried to follow their instructions. Since it didn't work out, I thought I misunderstood something, so decided to exactly copy-paste it.
[07:08:43] <xec> obviously something is different between the two pages
[07:09:07] <xec> question is what ^^
[07:10:43] <starsinmypockets> Sorry - little stupid... How do I keep 'Hide me' from triggering the toggle() when clicked (I just want it to be hidden and shown when the parent is clicked...) http://jsfiddle.net/v6meb/
[07:12:14] <quicksilver> starsinmypockets: Hide this is *part of* the parent, so the click handler fires.
[07:12:28] <quicksilver> starsinmypockets: maybe you want to put the click handler on a span around the word "Year"
[07:12:35] <quicksilver> starsinmypockets: so it only fires if you click on that word.
[07:12:43] <xec> starsinmypockets: you can prevent bubbling on the child element
[07:12:51] <pachet> starsinmypockets: http://jsfiddle.net/sxB3w/
[07:13:46] <pachet> but reading up, i'd actually go with what quicksilver said, barring any other constraints you have
[07:14:13] <quicksilver> why does jsfiddle not have bullets for those ULs? does jsfiddle have a minimal CSS reset?
[07:14:32] <xec> quicksilver: ye there's a checkbox on the left for "normalized css"
[07:14:41] <NodeX> ul's dont have bullets
[07:14:46] <NodeX> li's do !!
[07:15:03] <xec> NodeX: not in a ol!
[07:15:16] <NodeX> they can if you add them :P
[07:15:19] <xec> </uselesscomment>
[07:15:26] <NodeX> +1
[07:15:31] <ChrisTheSorcerer> +2
[07:15:32] <starsinmypockets> food for thought - thanks all... think I'll try the span and go read about bubbling and propogation
[07:16:45] <NodeX> best advice ever : Bubbles rise !!
[07:18:11] <ChrisTheSorcerer> This is when you wish you could add sounds to IRC... so I could put in NC's "F**** Bubbles" soundclip :P
[07:19:44] <starsinmypockets> The very simple solution: thanks quicksilver
[07:19:48] <starsinmypockets> http://jsfiddle.net/CwPKb/
[07:21:48] <quicksilver> :)
[07:32:51] <nattyp> what is the correct syntax for selecting all elements with one of several possible values -- $(elem).filter('[attr="val1]", "[attr="val2"]')
[07:35:10] <NodeX> you can regex it if they have a common like "val"
[07:35:30] <quicksilver> you can always regex it
[07:35:35] <NodeX> attr*"val" iirc (check the dacs on that)
[07:35:37] <NodeX> ^^
[07:35:44] <quicksilver> even if the regex is the boring old (val1|val2|val3)
[07:36:08] <quicksilver> (obvious if they really all start with val it might be clearer to write val(1|2|3)
[07:36:58] <nattyp> cool, will look at that
[07:37:03] <tocka> Hey guys, could someone tell me what does this mean? http://pastebin.com/UMWRC3rV
[07:37:28] <johnkpaul> tocka: are you sure jQuery is on the page?
[07:37:45] <johnkpaul> try jQuery(".homeTabs") instead of $
[07:38:23] <tocka> ok
[07:44:32] <mdhopkins> /join rubyonrails
[07:44:38] <mdhopkins> weird.
[07:47:37] <andrew9183> is there a way to find out the length of a data object in a get?
[07:49:05] <amirite> for var in foo count++
[07:49:24] <ThiefMaster> if you have to do that you are probably doing something wrong
[07:50:50] <amirite> nobody uses jquery-mx jmvc?
[08:03:36] <b-lew__> For some reason this script http://pastie.org/3804701 isn't working on this link. http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/#home_contact -> am I doing something wrong?
[08:07:45] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I'm not nearly experienced enough to see what that was supposed to do
[08:08:37] <amirite> shutup your face
[08:08:40] <thebignoise> is there a way to get the next element? -- no matter where it is
[08:09:48] <johnkpaul> ?next @thebignoise
[08:09:48] <bot-t> thebignoise, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[08:10:09] <thebignoise> johnkpaul: yea that gets the immediate sibling
[08:10:13] <thebignoise> its not immediate
[08:10:31] <thebignoise> or a sibling
[08:11:07] <johnkpaul> what does immediate mean?
[08:11:13] <johnkpaul> .parent().next().first()?
[08:11:51] <thebignoise> johnkpaul: unfortunately its not always consistent like that
[08:12:21] <johnkpaul> you probably need to make some custom function, perahps on jQuery.fn, that includes whatever logic you need
[08:12:47] <thebignoise> johnkpaul: yea i figured. lol okay thanks
[08:15:01] <wicchan> anyone know how to modify the request headers in an ajax request in jquery? :)
[08:16:08] <johnkpaul> ?beforesend @wicchan
[08:16:09] <bot-t> wicchan, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:16:49] <markq> g hello
[08:16:49] <caniuse> markq: Celebrity news, fashion and beauty - hello! Online - http://www.hellomagazine.com/
[08:16:59] <astropirate> wicchan, look at the headers property http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax
[08:17:11] <markq> wicchan: checkout this:
[08:17:18] <markq> g superagent github
[08:17:19] <caniuse> markq: visionmedia/superagent · GitHub - https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent
[08:17:24] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Ok, signing out for the day. Until next time!
[08:17:59] <wicchan> i was looking at the headers property
[08:18:29] <wicchan> but technically are the properties within the headers property teh same as it would be in http request
[08:18:34] <Zeph88> Is there a way to get the text of a link clicked?
[08:18:48] <wicchan> like for accept is it formatted like header { Accept: "some content type" }
[08:18:51] <wicchan> ?
[08:19:08] <wicchan> Zeph88 i think theres .text()
[08:19:54] <Zeph88> Cool, thanks
[08:20:54] <fRAiLtY-> For some odd reason my menu won't fade in/out http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/ if you hover the pink button it shows/hides. But, it should fade.. why doesn't it?
[08:23:00] <johnkpaul> wicchan: what is your question?, how to add headers to the xhr object?
[08:23:26] <wicchan> in the ajax request, i'm planning to make it a little more secure on the call
[08:23:32] <wicchan> so i want to pass in the headers
[08:23:41] <johnkpaul> wicchan: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XMLHttpRequest#setRequestHeader()
[08:23:42] <wicchan> and have the server side check for the header before serving up the json
[08:25:08] <wicchan> checking it out :)
[08:29:59] <markq> superagent is better than jQuery's implementation of ajax imo
[08:30:56] <wicchan> superagent is a js library?
[08:31:04] <markq> yep
[08:31:19] <markq> client js lib for ajax
[08:31:40] <markq> its creator is pretty popular in the node.js scene
[08:32:02] <markq> but honestly I've had great expriences with it
[08:32:29] <thebignoise> var rscore = /[1-16]/; rscore.test("5");
[08:32:29] <thebignoise> false
[08:32:37] <thebignoise> can someone tell me why that doesn
[08:32:38] <thebignoise> work
[08:32:40] <thebignoise> ?
[08:32:55] <thebignoise> var rscore = /[1-16]/; rscore.test(5);
[08:32:55] <thebignoise> false
[08:32:57] <thebignoise> also fails
[08:33:14] <johnkpaul> [1-16] isn't a valid digit regex, I believe
[08:33:46] <thebignoise> its works when i do [0-6]
[08:33:47] <quicksilver> well, it matches digits 1 and 6.
[08:33:54] <quicksilver> step 1. learn javascript
[08:33:59] <quicksilver> this comes before step 2. learn jquery.
[08:34:42] <johnkpaul> ?learn @thebignoise
[08:34:42] <bot-t> thebignoise, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[08:35:39] <johnkpaul> oh quicksilver, it's [1-1] and [6]
[08:35:52] <johnkpaul> regex is intersting, I have the orielly book on my bookshelf but havn't read it
[08:35:54] <quicksilver> right.
[08:36:09] <wicchan> thanks markq haha
[08:36:13] <quicksilver> regex is not the right way to check number ranges though :)
[08:36:59] <johnkpaul> :) yes, that's true, a > and <= would do just fine
[08:43:49] <jwg2s> hey all, working with a sliding login panel.  http://24.125.42.135/ . As you can see, the panel pushes the content down on the first screen.  However, if you scroll down, i lose the login bar and it breaks, but i can't set it to fixed because then it won't push the content down.  Any suggestions?
[08:47:34] <raj> doing .html(null) is giving me something blank, while doing .html(undefined) is basically like doing .html()
[08:48:51] <johnkpaul> raj: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.fn.html
[08:49:41] <johnkpaul> raj: that makes sense, the first line is checking if value=== undefined
[08:49:54] <wicchan> ok i'm using the headers property in the the jquery ajax call but it doesn't seem to change when i check in firebug
[08:50:12] <wicchan> when i am trying to change either the Referer or the Host
[08:50:23] <raj> thanks johnkpaul
[08:50:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I have a bunch of images of random sizes... but I wanna display them by cropping them all to the same size... Is there a jquery way to do this?
[08:50:57] <johnkpaul> raj: no problem
[08:51:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Do I actually need to physically crop them or is there another way?
[08:51:16] <johnkpaul> wicchan: the browser won't let you control that
[08:51:29] <johnkpaul> part of the sandbox
[08:51:59] <wicchan> is it detected by the server side though for teh ajax call?
[08:53:16] <johnkpaul> wicchan: that's up to your server, no?
[08:53:38] <raj> I have an odd problem, when I use this line--> `var description = $item.data('description') || undefined` ...once I hit an $item that has a value for its data('description'), every undefined value has that value when I click on it
[08:53:58] <nattyp> how do I match an elem that has no attributes
[08:53:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> anyone? :(
[08:53:59] <raj> this is on a click handler for clicking on a div
[08:54:57] <wicchan> right but i'm curious if that was just being sent and if the server side would detect that
[08:55:00] <wicchan> i'll double check :)
[08:55:12] <nattyp> got it not([attr])
[08:55:47] <raj> each div is represented by $item
[08:56:27] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm including a <script src="http://10.3.1.2/script.js"></script> in my <head> which works if you're on the internal network but won't load if you're outside it (it's a LAN ip). That's what I want, but I notice if you're outside it, the page loads much slower since it's trying to access that LAN IP. Is there any way to prevent it slowing down? Like skipping the load attempt if you're external?
[08:58:32] <timwis> Or maybe a way to only do the include if the user's IP is a certain range? (To test if the user is in the network)
[08:59:42] <jwg2s> http://24.125.42.135/ help with sliding panel would be great, can't get it to stay in place and still push content down
[08:59:51] <raj> i guess js doesn't play well with undefined
[09:00:04] <raj> as soon as its defined even locally, somehow it sticks
[09:00:12] <wicchan> johnkpaul apparently its not being detected from the server side script
[09:00:35] <johnkpaul> wicchan: what do you mean "not being detected"?
[09:00:40] <nFFF> raj post your code to jsfiddle
[09:01:01] <wicchan> the global vars for the http_referer is the same as how teh browser renders it to be
[09:01:11] <johnkpaul> oh, yes, that's what I said
[09:01:18] <wicchan> lol
[09:01:24] <johnkpaul> you cannot override the referrer in your javascript
[09:01:32] <wicchan> i see
[09:01:58] <wicchan> so what parameters can actually go into the headers property in the ajax call?
[09:02:01] <axl_> where can quickly test out some JQuery ?
[09:02:14] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @axl_
[09:02:15] <bot-t> axl_, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[09:02:25] <johnkpaul> wicchan: you can add any new header you want
[09:02:26] <axl_> awesome. thanks
[09:02:40] <wicchan> but i can't change teh referer in the header?
[09:03:01] <raj> nFFF, it's okay, I got it solved, thank you though :)
[09:03:05] <johnkpaul> wicchan: no, that would be a browser sandbox security issue
[09:03:08] <wicchan> well i guess what i am trying to change is the request headers
[09:03:15] <johnkpaul> wicchan: what is your goal here?
[09:04:15] <wicchan> just trying to limit the servings of the json only to a specific referer
[09:04:29] <wicchan> but i guess i can just detect the browser referer and have it only serve up to that particular one
[09:04:37] <wicchan> hmm
[09:05:24] <johnkpaul> wicchan: there should be no need to change any headers if that's your usage
[09:05:39] <wicchan> gotcha
[09:05:40] <johnkpaul> the referrer should be the domain that your js coming from
[09:05:45] <wicchan> yea
[09:05:47] <wicchan> haha
[09:05:54] <wicchan> just thought about it for a sec :p
[09:05:56] <wicchan> thanks

[09:11:51] <thebignoise> "players["+player+"][1][S]" : $("#score").val()
[09:11:56] <thebignoise> is there anyway to do this
[09:12:05] <thebignoise> its in my dataArray
[09:12:10] <thebignoise> that i pass to an ajax request
[09:12:53] <quicksilver> that should be fine, thebignoise
[09:13:42] <thebignoise> quicksilver: i get missing : after property id
[09:14:13] <alexr2> thebignoise, you're probably missing a comma in the previous line
[09:14:19] <thebignoise> http://jsfiddle.net/EU5bg/
[09:14:46] <b-lew> http://jsbin.com/agusin/2/edit#preview -> this is working in here but its not working in my website. am I writing this properly?
[09:15:09] <alexr2> thebignoise, what line are you getting the error on?
[09:15:19] <thebignoise> 'players['+player+'][1][S]' : $("#score").val()
[09:15:21] <thebignoise> that one ^
[09:15:59] <alexr2> not sure you can set up objects like that (with a variable in the parameter name)
[09:16:07] <quicksilver> oh, you can't use expressions in the key position on an object
[09:16:16] <quicksilver> javascript is such a ridiculous language.
[09:16:32] <thebignoise> well that kinda blows
[09:16:34] <thebignoise> lol
[09:16:40] <quicksilver> var myDataObject = {}; myDataObject['players['+player+'][1][S]'] = $("#score").val();
[09:16:44] <alexr2> you can just do var myDataObject = {}; myDataObject['players['+player+'][1][S]'] = $('#score').val()
[09:16:48] <quicksilver> thebignoise: just assign them one by one.
[09:16:56] <thebignoise> quicksilver: okay thank you
[09:16:56] <alexr2> meh

[09:27:36] <wuwoot> justinhjohnson: still appears to require a second click...
[09:28:21] <justinhjohnson> wuwoot: yeah, working on that now, the problem is that you're waiting to bind a 2nd click event listener only after the first click occurs
[09:28:32] <justinhjohnson> need to work on removing that inner .click()
[09:28:54] <wuwoot> justinhjohnson: ah. sorry, new to javascript and jquery in general. thanks for the help (=

[09:32:43] <nattyp> find not working as expected, query ignores commented out elements right?
[09:35:34] <nattyp> must be the cache, I removed the file from the server and the query still returns the old value
[09:39:39] <DannyZB> when is the plugins site coming back up ?
[09:40:06] <nattyp> scrap the silly comments question, the result was being cached
[09:42:23] <crankharder> is there some fundamental reason why the docs for .live, and now .on do not define a list of events for which it is compatible?
[09:43:08] <DannyZB> it's compatible for all events ..
[09:47:50] <crankharder> DanGer: right, but hover is an event and .hover takes two handlers, and .on doesn't take two handlers
[09:52:58] <nFFF> so can .on
[09:53:00] <danzik17> crankharder: hover is not a real event, it's a pseudo event that just does .mouseenter( handler ).mouseleave( handler )
[09:53:06] <nFFF> pass the functions as object
[10:00:36] <Ezek2k5> anyone know if theres a way to make transitions like the ones on nivo sliders but on the content.. like when i load a webpage the div #content will load with an effect like one of those used in the nivo slider

[10:09:06] <axl_> i am a ruby dev, i am just hacking around
[10:09:18] <axl_> any idea how I could get my script 'replaceWith' script working ?
[10:11:02] <johnkpaul-afk> axl_: what is uniform.js?
[10:11:36] <axl_> its this thing that makes forms look sexy and the designer who used to work here used it: http://uniformjs.com/#intro
[10:12:10] <johnkpaul-afk> what is conflicting?
[10:16:11] <axl_> johnkpaul: not sure but my script does not work
[10:16:41] <johnkpaul> :/ what does "not work" mean?
[10:16:49] <johnkpaul> you're not calling .uniform() on the new elements

[10:27:52] <scar2> when using a table filter with dropdowns, it seems the value is like stored in a session or something--- when i competely close out the page after selecting columns to sort/filter, i open a new window and go to the site and back to the page, and the value in the dropdown is stored...
[10:28:00] <scar2> http://www.servicerubber.com/vibration-isolation-mounts/5000-series/
[10:31:16] <axl_> johnkpaul: do you mean i should be doing something like this:    $('#billing_state').replaceWith('<input type="text" name="transaction[billing][region]" id="billing_state">').uniform();
[10:31:40] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know the semantics of .replaceWith, but yes, something like that
[10:32:10] <johnkpaul> ?replaceWith

[11:06:21] <roswell> hi everyone. in a jquery dialog(), i have a button handler function: http://pastebin.com/AXYXu23j somehow it's behaving weird
[11:07:28] <jstout24> how can i make a jquery plugin to do $.myFn({ … })
[11:07:34] <jstout24> without passing an element
[11:08:04] <jstout24> found it
[11:08:09] <jstout24> damn, i'm good at finding my own answers today!
[11:08:12] <jstout24> :P
[11:08:18] <Eviltwin> How about you try looking before asking here
[11:08:20] <jstout24> this google guy is crazy!
[11:08:22] <natas77> hi guys i wanna crate a slider and my quastion: is ther a way to move tehe pictures in a tabel element?
[11:08:45] <jstout24> Eviltwin, I was looking everywhere but all the "tutorials" are about fn.
[11:09:10] <Eviltwin> You appear to have answered your question in the same minute that you asked it
[11:09:50] <dwarder> i can't find the manual on jquery website about this: $.widget what is it?
[11:10:02] <natas77> http://jsfiddle.net/u8GW6/10/
[11:10:07] <natas77> hier is my code
[11:10:15] <roswell> dwarder, http://jqueryui.com/demos/widget
[11:10:39] <scar2> natas77: wheres the js?
[11:10:40] <dwarder> roswell: thanks
[11:11:44] <natas77> scar2: sorry
[11:13:14] <natas77> scar2: so hier is it : http://jsfiddle.net/u8GW6/11/
[11:13:33] <savid> Is there a way to do a multiple attribute selector,  but with ANY instead of ALL?   That is, I want to select elements that have any one of the following attribute values...
[11:15:26] <roswell> savid, maybe you want this http://api.jquery.com/multiple-attribute-selector/
[11:15:39] <roswell> ah... misread
[11:15:40] <scar2> hey guys, im using picnet.table.filter -- and it provides dropdowns above columns on html table that lets you filter-- the problem is, the value of what i set the dropdown to stays in a session or something... not sure whats up.
[11:18:01] <`poo> or something
[11:18:52] <roswell> savid, try combining multiple selectors with multiple attribute selectors, i. e. $( '*[attr1=value1], *[attr2=value2]' )
[11:19:39] <akahn> How can I detect when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page?
[11:20:23] <`poo> bind to the scroll event
[11:20:37] <Eviltwin> akahn: The pieces you need are $(window).scrollTop(), $(window).height(), and $(document).height()
[11:20:46] <Eviltwin> Plus $(window).scroll(function() { ... });
[11:20:52] <Eviltwin> To detect scrolling
[11:20:58] <akahn> ah, window's height versus document's height, brillant, thanks
[11:21:01] <Eviltwin> I'd like you to attempt to put the pieces together on your own first
[11:21:02] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[11:21:36] <savid> roswell, ah, yeah I could do that.  Guess I was looking for something a bit cleaner (like *[attr=foo|bar|baz]  or something).
[11:21:58] <savid> but that's good enough, I suppose :)
[11:22:42] <Eviltwin> Be aware that *[attr=value] is a pretty damn slow selector
[11:22:54] <roswell> savid, well maybe yours will do when jQuery has regex support for selectors )
[11:23:10] <`poo> gosh i hope it never does
[11:23:32] <Eviltwin> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[11:23:56] <roswell> heh there we go
[11:24:03] <`poo> search your data not your DOM :\
[11:24:48] <Eviltwin> However doing $("*:regex(attr,^foo|bar|baz$)") will cause it to run that block of code for every element in the page
[11:25:06] <Eviltwin> And thus you should at the very least try to narrow down the type first
[11:25:18] <scar2> is there an easy way to reset the value of a dropdown box on page load?
[11:26:15] <Eviltwin> $(window).load(function() { $("#dropdownbox").val(...); }) ?
[11:26:47] <roswell> Eviltwin, btw y not $( function() { ... } ); ?
[11:27:05] <`poo> that's $(document).ready
[11:27:08] <Eviltwin> Well A) because he asked for page load
[11:27:31] <Eviltwin> B) because there's no such shortcut for load
[11:28:35] <roswell> ah ok
[11:28:50] <scar2> Like, how do I grab element by class
[11:29:15] <Eviltwin> It uses CSS selectors
[11:29:29] <scar2> how can i apply the .reset() function to ALL items within a class?
[11:29:30] <Eviltwin> These are the CSS-style selectors jQuery offers: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[11:29:42] <Eviltwin> $("...").each(function(){this.reset()});
[11:31:33] <scar2> Eviltwin: http://www.servicerubber.com/vibration-isolation-mounts/2000-series/ -- i used : $(".filter").each(function(){this.reset()});
[11:31:52] <scar2> Eviltwin: when you select an item on dropdown, it filters the table--- try refreshing, or closing browser and reopen to that page and itll still be there... cant figure out why
[11:32:01] <scar2> Eviltwin: so im wanting to just reset the values after pageload
[11:32:10] <Eviltwin> Oh, .reset() is a property of forms
[11:32:20] <scar2> Eviltwin: reset a select box
[11:32:24] <scar2> Eviltwin: .val('') ?
[11:32:39] <scar2> that didnt owrk either =P
[11:32:53] <Eviltwin> $(this).val($(this).attr("value")) ?
[11:32:58] <Spectavian> Can anyone help me with the following problem http://pastebin.com/325G4H43
[11:33:11] <scar2> Eviltwin: $(".filter").each(function(){this.val('')}); ?
[11:33:33] <Eviltwin> scar2: Try "$": jQuery.noConflict()
[11:33:35] <Eviltwin> Err
[11:33:39] <Eviltwin> Spectavian: Try "$": jQuery.noConflict()
[11:34:07] <Eviltwin> Or Loader["$"]
[11:36:52] <Spectavian> Eviltwin: The problem was that the version of backbone and underscore don't support AMD

[11:43:52] <thebignoise> i have an object: obj1 { obj2 { something : val }}
[11:43:57] <Spectavian> gsr: welcome
[11:43:58] <thebignoise> how do i reference that?
[11:44:06] <thebignoise> i tried obj1.obj2.something
[11:44:18] <Spectavian> What do you mean by "that"
[11:44:53] <Spectavian> You want "val"?
[11:44:58] <thebignoise> basically yes
[11:45:17] <Spectavian> obj1.obj2[something] works or not?
[11:45:31] <thebignoise> nope
[11:45:45] <Spectavian> Please show via pastebin
[11:45:55] <thebignoise> okay
[11:46:47] <Whirl3d> Afternoon all. would it make sense to create a function that sets up an element's animation sequence and returns a deferred object. Then I could attach multiple handlers to the animation complete event that would fire once the deferred object is resolved...
[11:47:37] <Whirl3d> and if the object was already resolved when a new handler is attached, it would fire immediately, right?
[11:47:43] <`poo> sounds sensible to me. but i haven't done something similar
[11:47:49] <thebignoise> http://pastebin.com/HVrdGJb0
[11:47:53] <thebignoise> thats the objects
[11:47:59] <`poo> yes it'd fire immediately i believe
[11:48:01] <thebignoise> first object is called d
[11:48:09] <thebignoise> and object in d is fair
[11:48:19] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/02/merging-jquery-deferreds-and-animate
[11:48:26] <`poo> thebignoise:  that isn't javascript
[11:48:49] <thebignoise> `poo: thats the output
[11:48:49] <gsr> Spectavian, ahh, my problem was something else.  because the select box was loaded by an ajax call, it wasnt registered with the DOM.  used .live('change', function() {}); instead.
[11:48:56] <thebignoise> of the object
[11:49:01] <thebignoise> its a json object
[11:49:02] <`poo> meaning?
[11:49:11] <`poo> doesn't look like one
[11:49:17] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, you always have such great references. Thanks.
[11:49:27] <`poo> johnkpaul++
[11:49:31] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[11:49:35] <jrockjiggz> i'm having a heck of a time finding a best-practice solution to submitting a form that requires ajax-validation
[11:49:45] <akahn> Anyone know a way to cancel a scroll's inertia?
[11:50:06] <Spectavian> gsr, makes sense.
[11:50:08] <`poo> apply opposite force
[11:51:22] <Spectavian> thebignoise: Can you paste your actual code that is running?
[11:52:39] <thebignoise> Spectavian: http://pastebin.com/T6DzLixt
[11:53:03] <`poo> ;)
[11:53:30] <thebignoise> and 'd' is an object with objects in it
[11:53:55] <bjensen> how can I keep the plugins work with dom elements that are retrieved through ajax?
[11:53:58] <`poo> d.id, d.firstName etc would probably work
[11:54:02] <`poo> no idea about that Obj2 crap
[11:54:05] <`poo> that's not json
[11:54:49] <thebignoise> those do work
[11:55:03] <thebignoise> i need to get the obj within the obj though
[11:55:07] <`poo> bjensen: like you do when the dom elements aren't loaded through ajax
[11:55:25] <bjensen> poo: you mean using #live?
[11:55:30] <`poo> then paste the actual JSON, not some console output
[11:55:48] <`poo> bjensen i don't know what you were using
[11:56:01] <`poo> or what plugins you're talking about..
[11:56:47] <bjensen> poo: well if I do $(".datepicker").datepicker(); on document ready then it will only work on those elements that are currently in the dom..I would like to be able to make such a statement, that also takes future elements into consideration
[11:56:53] <Spectavian> thebignoise: Yeah, paste the JSON
[11:57:06] <thebignoise> Spectavian: i got it. thank you
[11:57:19] <Spectavian> http://jsbeautifier.org/
[11:57:27] <Spectavian> Can you tell me what the answer was?
[11:57:32] <`poo> bjensen: you usually need to call the plugin functions again, or some refresh option on them, after adding new stuff to your DOM
[11:57:46] <`poo> bjensen: most plugins don't track your DOM for new stuff..
[11:58:10] <bjensen> right reinitialize the plugins…I was hoping I didn't have to do that as it seams like a hack IMO
[11:58:19] <`poo> it's not a hack
[11:58:31] <`poo> the .datepicker() takes a DOM element and works its magic on it
[11:58:57] <`poo> that's it
[11:59:03] <`poo> if the DOM element doesn't exist yet, no can do
[11:59:14] <`poo> afaik
[11:59:28] <bjensen> I mean having to call $(".date").datepicker(); every time I do a ajax request is a bit of a hack imo
[12:00:11] <`poo> i don't see it that way
[12:00:45] <`poo> it has nothing to do with your ajax request
[12:00:49] <`poo> it's the DOM manipulation
[12:00:50] <Whirl3d> so when using .then(successHandler, failHandler) on a deferred promise, what is the scope of 'this' inside the handlers?
[12:01:39] <danzik17> Whirl3d: depends on how it was resolved or rejected, can't answer that straight out
[12:01:42] <danzik17> see ?resolvedWith

[12:05:50] <suplol> Hi all, I'm thinking on how to work this problem out the proper way, it might be very stupid, but here goes. I have a couple of divs, that when hovered over they should show a different div, works fine I know how to do this. Now I have about 16 div's that all show the same div, but with different content. Now, I thought, I write a function, so I can use it in HTML as;  onmouseover="myfunction()", this works, but mouseover has problems 
[12:06:27] <suplol> So I need to find a different way, for example use onmouseenter, which works great in Jquery, but is not avaliable for HTML. So would anyone know how to do this?
[12:08:10] <`poo> huh?
[12:08:27] <PseudoNinja> has anyone in here successfully implemented the DataTables extension while utilizing $.noconflict() ?
[12:09:45] <PseudoNinja> project is 1.4.1 but needed bug repaired in 1.5 in order to get events to work correctly
[12:10:30] <PseudoNinja> so we have 1.4.1 and 1.7.1 loaded
[12:12:10] <suplol> `poo: Let me try to explain it better. Lets say I 10 divs, on each mouseover on one of those divs, a other div should appear, this is easily done in jquery. $('div_1').hover(function() { $('#showmyotherdiv').show });, now i'm wondering what is the best way to do this properly? I could copy/paste the code i just wrote 10 times and change the names etc, or write a function for them?
[12:16:29] <`poo> suplol: if they all have the same class you can:  $('.myClassName').hover(......)
[12:20:56] <n00b3654> hello
[12:21:18] <sunbeam> how can I disable javascript in my browser (firefox)
[12:23:34] <suplol> `poo: They do, but foreach hover on one of those 10 divs, i want to show a different div, so; lets say i hover over #div1, i want to show div #content_1 and for #div2 i want to show #content_2, etc.
[12:25:05] <suplol> I would think, write a function for it, and use the HTML onmouseover function and call the function, but, the problem with the onmouseover function in HTML is that it doesnt work properly when there are child elements in the main wrapper
[12:26:23] <suplol> for example, when there 's a table inside the div you have the onmouseover on, and the table has borders, as soon as your cursor hits the border it breaks the onmouseover, since you're not hovering over the div but the child element of the div
[12:27:13] <Ezek2k5> is it possible to make something like this http://aviathemes.com/aviaslider/?slider=winding-blocks but for content?
[12:27:41] <Ezek2k5> i mean i have a div and i would like to make a transition like that one ex.
[12:27:47] <jrockjiggz> is there a way to submit a form without causing the 'submit' event to trigger?
[12:28:03] <Ezek2k5> or that kind of transitions only works for images?
[12:29:13] <Ezek2k5> maybe if i fade the content load a big gif to make a little animation and then show the content
[12:29:46] <sunbeam> i just notice that so many big mainstream sites miss big sections of their site (not displayable) if the user has disabled js
[12:30:18] <Ezek2k5> why would a normal person disable js
[12:31:21] <Ezek2k5> im sure that steve jobs had flash disabled in his macbook
[12:33:37] <Ezek2k5> im asking at apple to see if anyone know the answer
[12:35:42] <Dr-Bombay> ezek: because the script sucks
[12:36:41] <Ezek2k5> yes but normal ppl dont know how to do that
[12:36:49] <Ezek2k5> i mean 90% maybe

[12:42:16] <axl_> http://jsfiddle.net/4z8UE/
[12:42:22] <axl_> it works quite well
[12:42:29] <axl_> however, i am using something called as uniform.js

[12:43:01] <axl_> and it doesn't seem to be working because iI am using it

[12:44:01] <axl_> here is the script I am trying to implement with while using uniform.js
[12:44:02] <axl_> https://gist.github.com/59f5f8749f31ac7fbf52
[12:44:07] <axl_> any thoughts on why it is not working?
[12:44:23] <jstout24> each dialog that pops up for the given elements ads a dialog to a dialog bag parameter… doing so, I created an object that holds the Dialog bag… MyObject.dialogable = { dialog_bag: {} }

[12:46:16] <superthebobfredm> Hey all, I'm trying to find the right paradigm for this.  I have a form, and part of that form is a drag-and-drop image collection.  When I submit the form, it will be via AJAX.  The trick here is that the form resides in a modal.  What is the best way for keeping the image information and submitting it (I want a multi-demensional array sent back to the server)
[12:46:22] <blez> when I do .stop() on .draggable()
[12:46:25] <superthebobfredm> ?
[12:46:28] <blez> the element can't be dragged again
[12:46:30] <blez> how to fix that?
[12:46:53] <zatan> hi how can I do liek this http://www.andrewhopeinvestment.co.uk/ ? add Div one by one ?
[12:48:05] <Whirl3d> jrockjiggz, I think you need to cache the form's original submit method then in your success callback, call the cached version to avoid the inifinite loop
[12:48:13] <suplol> I'm unsure on how to code something efficiently in JQuery, or atleast the method im using that is, a example is here http://jsfiddle.net/tnNR3/12/
[12:48:16] <superthebobfredm> zatan:  how about:  http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/timers
[12:48:54] * blez somebody?
[12:49:05] <superthebobfredm> zatan: or better yet: http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[12:49:22] <Whirl3d> superthebobfredm, howabout storing the array information in the data object of the container that spawned the modal?
[12:49:50] <superthebobfredm> Whirl3d: how?
[12:50:03] <zatan> superthebobfredm, cheers for info :)

[13:11:32] <tooter> hey - what is the 'correct' way to handle a input[type=file] change even - i want to auto-upload the form but $('#fieldName').on('change', function(e) { ..... does not appear to be playing - probably me being silly :)
[13:12:58] <shoky> suplol here's one way: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tnNR3/14/
[13:13:10] <shoky> it can surely be improved
[13:14:20] <shoky> i already answered you before as poo though, you didn't listen.. <`poo> suplol: if they all have the same class you can:  $('.myClassName').hover(......)
[13:14:49] <shoky> delegating the event to a container element would be much better
[13:15:08] <shoky> actually i'll do that
[13:18:11] <shoky> suplol: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tnNR3/16/
[13:19:39] <suplol> shoky: Thanks alot, I did reply to you previously, but I couldn't figure out how to get that id from it, thanks alot again

[13:19:54] <shoky> np
[13:21:37] <nFFF> Pallet, your selector is wrong
[13:21:47] <nFFF> #showhide
[13:21:49] <nFFF> is what you want
[13:24:31] <jrockjiggz> if i were generate a hidden form with jquery, do i need to append it to the DOM in order to submit it?
[13:24:44] <shoky> my guess would be yes
[13:24:47] <shoky> but no idea ;)
[13:25:00] <shoky> try and report

[13:25:53] <shoky> .filter()
[13:25:56] <Blaster> thanks
[13:27:12] <shoky> and jrockjiggz, window.location = ....;  is GET

[13:32:48] <yamahaalex37> http://pastie.org/3806556
[13:32:48] <yamahaalex37> sorry about the poop....
[13:32:48] <yamahaalex37> when I click the class,
[13:33:05] <shoky> johnkpaul its your cat biggie
[13:33:10] <shoky> apologizing
[13:33:22] <shoky> oh sorry it wasn't you with the cat.
[13:34:05] <johnkpaul> haha
[13:34:09] <johnkpaul> cat, what?
[13:34:28] <yamahaalex37> when I click the class, $clickedPageID is alerted right away. but only the second time i click it, $poop is alerted
[13:34:47] <yamahaalex37> i cleaned up the poop
[13:34:47] <johnkpaul> ah yamahaalex37, you have a misunderstanding about how ajax calls work
[13:34:49] <yamahaalex37> http://pastie.org/3806556
[13:34:49] <johnkpaul> they are asynchronous
[13:35:11] <johnkpaul> lines 3 and 4 of your paste are executed after all of the other lines
[13:35:22] <johnkpaul> they only get executed after the ajax call returns
[13:35:32] <johnkpaul> and returning avalue from that function doesn't do anything, bceause it doesn't go anywhere
[13:35:38] <yamahaalex37> uh lines 3 and 4 are called before the function they are in are called?
[13:35:40] <johnkpaul> this is a really really common question in here
[13:36:02] <johnkpaul> lines 3 and 4 are executed _after_ the ajax call has completed
[13:36:14] <johnkpaul> the ajax call started on line 14
[13:36:26] <shoky> johnkpaul, someprimetime i think was talking yesterday about his cat who had just pooped and .. missed.
[13:36:28] <johnkpaul> so $poop doesn't have the value of value
[13:36:31] <shoky> and then there was a pic to show
[13:36:35] <johnkpaul> shoky: glad I wasn't here
[13:36:41] <yamahaalex37> ok but the ajax call isnt started until the function is called
[13:36:59] <RPkS> what's up guys ...I got my toggle buttons working great and then suddenly the 2nd one is showing display:block when it's clearly labeled hidden.
[13:37:03] <yamahaalex37> because I have put plenty of ajax calls within click functions, and they arent called before click
[13:37:04] <johnkpaul> yes, yamahaalex37
[13:37:06] <shoky> excerpt:
[13:37:17] <shoky> <someprimetime> oh wow my cat just dropped a raunchy turd bbl
[13:37:35] <shoky> <someprimetime> NSFL: http://i.imgur.com/vAqFw.jpg
[13:37:36] <johnkpaul> oh, yamahaalex37, your issue is that the ajax call is happenning without clicking on #allpages?
[13:37:43] <shoky> and this is he: http://i.imgur.com/RPqK9.jpg
[13:37:50] <johnkpaul> :/ wish I didn't have the autoview images enabled in limechat
[13:37:54] <shoky> hahaha
[13:37:58] <yamahaalex37> nah johnkpaul i think your right im confused , about the ajax

[13:38:20] * shoky blinks
[13:38:21] <johnkpaul> nFFF: I don't know if when is the right way to go at first
[13:38:38] <johnkpaul> although I guess it's not necessarily harder than anything else
[13:38:42] <yamahaalex37> johnkpaul: and the second time i click , the value returned is the value from the last click
[13:39:27] <nFFF> Ive just been looking into defferreds alot recently, and starting to see their uses :>
[13:39:36] <johnkpaul> yeah, yamahaalex37, is there any other ajx calls that update $clickedPageId?
[13:39:39] <yamahaalex37> do I need to use .with to solve this?
[13:39:41] <shoky> RPkS, demo? smth?
[13:39:41] <johnkpaul> nFFF: yes, definitely, they are infinitely useful
[13:39:59] <johnkpaul> yamahaalex37: you can you $.when, but I'd recommend doing all of that reading first

[13:40:35] <yamahaalex37> johnkpaul: before i try to fix it, i dont understand what the problem is happening needing fixing
[13:41:18] <nFFF> yamahaalex37, basically make your function return the $.get , and then you can do $.when(func(arg1)).done(function(){alert(value);});
[13:41:27] <johnkpaul> yeah, I agree yamahaalex37, but I cna't really answer your previous question without understanding the rest of your code
[13:41:34] <johnkpaul> I don't know why the second time, that alert would work
[13:41:38] <johnkpaul> from the code you shared in pastebin
[13:42:09] <johnkpaul> nFFF: just wait till you start using pipe
[13:42:13] <johnkpaul> it's amazing stuff
[13:42:45] <RPkS> If I can get someone to visit the site I think this should be an easy fix ...for once. LOL

[13:48:28] <RPkS> yes they are
[13:48:31] <johnkpaul> dwarder: that is a convention to get around dynamically bound this

[13:51:46] <RPkS> http://pastebin.com/hr3CZ345
[13:52:20] <johnkpaul> RPkS: that doesn't really narrow it down
[13:52:28] <johnkpaul> and at least use some syntax highlighting
[13:52:29] <RPkS> johnkpaul: that paste bin has everything in it ....the style.css info that relates to it. THe Javascript and the HTML
[13:52:39] <scar2> How can I grab a "class" of SELECT dropdowns and "Reset" them, or just make it turn to the value it is on pageload?
[13:52:46] <yamahaalex37> johnkpaul: nFFF this seems to delay properly http://pastie.org/3806556
[13:52:48] <RPkS> I put <-------- --------->
[13:52:57] <yamahaalex37> except its not returning the value for the entire function
[13:54:05] <jrockjiggz> anyone know why this is appending 2 elements not 1? http://jsfiddle.net/t9vFu/
[13:54:49] <johnkpaul> RPkS: it is very difficult to read like that, and it would be very helpful if you actually showed the code that related to your question, the jquery code
[13:55:09] <Whirl3d> jrockjiggz, you are using $.each on an object that has two properties.
[13:55:12] <johnkpaul> scar2: you can reset the form using form.reset()
[13:55:12] <Eviltwin> jrockjiggz: You really can't tell?
[13:55:24] <johnkpaul> ?mdn form.reset
[13:55:25] <bot-t> johnkpaul, .outerHeight() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/

[13:55:32] <Eviltwin> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/t9vFu/1/
[13:55:57] <johnkpaul> yamahaalex37: you're still misunderstanding
[13:56:04] <johnkpaul> the return value for clickedPageOrderId is undefined
[13:56:06] <nFFF> yamahaalex37 what you said doesnt make sense :> the reason its not returning the value from the entire function is becuase it's not delaying properly, you can't delay against asynchronous requests by definition. you need to wait until the request has finished and then do something
[13:56:15] <johnkpaul> because value is undefined
[13:56:21] <jrockjiggz> Eviltwin: ty.. but what if the object has more than 1 entry
[13:56:29] <yamahaalex37> id like to not return the value until the ajax call is done
[13:56:32] <yamahaalex37> is that not what im trying to do?
[13:56:33] <johnkpaul> yeah, this is definitely a really common problem, I need to find a go to blog post
[13:56:38] <RPkS> johnkpaul: did you see the Javascript or do you need something else?
[13:56:46] <Eviltwin> jrockjiggz: It can't have more than one "name" and "value" property in the same object
[13:56:51] <scar2> johnkpaul its not a form though. this jquery plugin for table filter (http://www.servicerubber.com/rubber-grommets/standard/) -- when i select a dropdown to filter... i can close the page and reopen it and the option selected is STILL selected-- not reset
[13:57:39] <yamahaalex37> nFFF: i read the doc, and followed the example, im just trying to wait until the ajax call is .done to return the functions value?
[13:58:32] <Eviltwin> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/t9vFu/2/
[13:58:45] <johnkpaul> ?ajax101 @yamahaalex37
[13:58:45] <bot-t> yamahaalex37, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[13:58:51] <scar2> johnkpaul: nvm its an option :P
[13:58:59] <johnkpaul> ha, that's good scar2
[13:59:49] <nFFF> yamahaalex37 something like this http://jsfiddle.net/7QRKQ/
[14:00:39] <nFFF> wrap the alert in a func tho
[14:01:01] <nFFF> actually you can rewrite the whole thing
[14:02:27] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/7QRKQ/2/
[14:03:19] <RPkS> johnkpaul: Try this http://pastebin.com/cTLf5yCe
[14:04:47] <johnkpaul> RPkS: can you explain what you're doing in taht code?
[14:04:48] <youngin> Eviltwin: can we talk?
[14:05:07] <johnkpaul> every click on the page, you're checking if the click is on some elements?
[14:05:20] <Eviltwin> youngin: Sorry, really busy right now
[14:05:32] <RPkS> johnkpaul: Well, I want both of those buttons to fold down when they are pressed.
[14:05:37] <youngin> np
[14:06:08] <johnkpaul> RPkS: tbh, this code is extremely confusing
[14:06:31] <johnkpaul> where do the buttons fold down
[14:06:34] <RPkS> johnkpaul: Someone put it together for me and it was working, but I must have made a slight change to a class name and that messed up the code
[14:06:46] <johnkpaul> git checkout filename?
[14:06:58] <RPkS> if you will click on the return button you can see that it woprks correctly
[14:06:58] <johnkpaul> that'll delete all of your changes
[14:07:21] <johnkpaul> yes, RPkS, I see that, but seeing the correct behavior doesn't really show me anything in your code
[14:07:59] <RPkS> Well what can I get you? I made a pastebin with everything that pertains to it
[14:09:37] <johnkpaul> RPkS, this channel is for help with jQuery issues, although I'm sure this is somehow jquery related, I think that it would really help to hire someone who knows jquery and oscommerce
[14:10:24] <RPkS> I think I figured it out ....I need to change the display to none for both buttons window.
[14:10:37] <johnkpaul> great
[14:15:25] <RPkS> nope, no dice. :(
[14:16:34] <sunbeam> does anyone know a good simulator that can display site like ipad does?
[14:19:49] <rroelofs> if you have a mac there's an iOS Simulator
[14:20:21] <jrockjiggz> can anyone tell me how to populate with data: http://jsfiddle.net/pPCyH/1/
[14:20:47] <rroelofs> sunbeam: you need the dev tools to get it
[14:20:59] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: http://mattkersley.com/responsive/
[14:21:14] <Whirl3d> jrockjiggz, what are you trying to accomplish?
[14:21:33] <johnkpaul> that's not exactly like an ipad, but you can see the different widths, wunz_
[14:21:34] <jrockjiggz> Whirl3d: generate input fields with the data from the hidden <form>
[14:23:41] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: that's not accurate, the ipad displays sites different than that
[14:24:02] <mszola> Hey, I came by because I know this channel has a lot of active people in it. Has anyone worked with HTML 5 Canvas?
[14:24:10] <johnkpaul> the most accurate on a desktop would be the ios simulator
[14:24:28] <johnkpaul> mszola: you skipped #html5?
[14:24:28] <mszola> I'm trying to slice a part of an image and am not getting the expected result
[14:24:45] <mszola> didn't know about the channel. Is it an active one? I'd be happy to check it :)
[14:25:19] <mszola> Thank you johnkpaul :)
[14:26:02] <jrockjiggz> Whirl3d: i kinda got the data, but do you know how to avoid a double .each ? http://jsfiddle.net/pPCyH/4/
[14:27:53] <jrockjiggz> Whirl3d: got it :) http://jsfiddle.net/pPCyH/5/
[14:29:56] <Whirl3d> Why isn't this working, though? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/pPCyH/6/
[14:31:28] <Whirl3d> lol...id="#dest"  that's why
[14:32:03] <Whirl3d> plus I didn't know you couldn't change the type property/attribute of an input element. Interesting
[14:33:10] <UppityTeapot> Howdy. Quick question: What's the best way of testing the width of an element dynamically, without it being incredibly slow? I've currently got this: http://jsfiddle.net/Teapot/Q537z/
[14:34:07] <johnkpaul> ?width @UppityTeapot
[14:34:08] <bot-t> UppityTeapot, .width(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/width/
[14:34:24] <johnkpaul> oh
[14:34:28] <johnkpaul> I see what you're looking for
[14:34:30] <Whirl3d> jrockjiggz, what about http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/pPCyH/7/
[14:34:41] <johnkpaul> that's really you're only option, what do you mean "incredibly slow"?
[14:35:02] <johnkpaul> if that code had a problem UppityTeapot, I'd say that you weren't throttling your calls to resize
[14:35:05] <UppityTeapot> Well, right now it checks constantly as I'm resizing the element. I'm wondering if I can make that more efficient.
[14:35:14] <johnkpaul> ?throttle/debounce
[14:35:15] <bot-t> johnkpaul, jQuery throttle / debounce - Plugins - jQuery - jQuery throttle / debounce allows you to rate-limit your functions in multiple useful ways. Passing a delay and callback to $.throttle returns a new function that will execute no more than once eve... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ba-jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin
[14:35:22] <UppityTeapot> aha, thank you
[14:35:30] <UppityTeapot> that's exactly what I'm looking for
[14:35:35] <johnkpaul> :) no problem UppityTeapot
[14:41:58] <sarspazam> there's some such shit about
[14:41:59] <sarspazam> http://www.mkyong.com/jquery/page-loading-effects-with-jquery/
[14:42:23] <jrockjiggz> Great! I present my solution to validate a form using ajax without needing async: false, or needing to use timeout(): http://jsfiddle.net/hHqtn/19/
[14:42:23] <sarspazam> your website just wouldn't show if you dont have js enabled
[14:45:13] <ajpiano> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/5tCp3/6/ is what i have for that problem
[14:45:30] <ajpiano> you defeinitely don't need to get into the business of creating a whole other form etc
[14:46:43] <wuwoot> is the following possible?
[14:46:44] <wuwoot> <ul style="need_to_target li here"><li></li></ul>
[14:47:00] <wuwoot> is there anyway to target the child element within the style attribute?
[14:47:40] <Whirl3d> wow, I never think to call the native element's submit on a form. I always struggle with that. Thanks ajpiano
[14:49:57] <MeXTuX> I'm displaying a result set on a page and every row is a div. I would like to have a button inside every div so when that button is pressed some data will be sent to the server via AJAX. Is there a way to have a hidden value for every row and send it to the server if the button is pressed???
[14:49:57] <rroelofs> wuwoot: nope
[14:50:27] <rroelofs> obviously you can do it in a <style> block or via jquery
[14:51:33] <wuwoot> rroelofs: thanks. i know i can do it in a style block, but that requires me to jump out and add it to my css or my header document for a little menu that's contained on one page...
[14:52:17] <wuwoot> rroelofs: so i resorted to just adding the style that i needed to each individual element instead -- i just needed to add some bottom-margin to each <li> tag in that menu
[15:10:26] <jrockjiggz> ajpiano: your solution is really interesting, except f[0].submit(); is not submitting the form with data.. i've merged my script with your solution and my response page is not receiving anything http://jsfiddle.net/hHqtn/20/
[15:13:06] <ajpiano> jrockjiggz: your form is a post and it looks like your debug page is printing out $_GET
[15:14:44] <jrockjiggz> ok, you are right $_REQUEST is correct... i need the form to "POST" as to use $_GET
[15:15:53] <nFFF> I don't get why there needs to be different ways to send data to the server
[15:16:48] <nFFF> couldn't we just have one way to send data to the server and be no worse off
[15:16:48] <jrockjiggz> nFFF: google: POST vs GET
[15:17:03] <nFFF> jrockjiggz I understand the difference
[15:17:12] <jrockjiggz> its always been confusing
[15:17:14] <nFFF> just not why it matters whether its in the url
[15:17:31] <nFFF> or in the msg bodyh
[15:17:35] <jrockjiggz> nFFF: say you send a file, you wouldn't be able to transfer the data with url
[15:17:35] <nFFF> why does it matter :|
[15:17:36] <Dr-Bombay> nfff: that isn't the only difference
[15:18:18] <Dr-Bombay> GET is for stable responses that can be cached. POST is for other kinds of responses.
[15:18:24] <Dr-Bombay> so yes, there should be both of them
[15:18:29] <Dr-Bombay> in some form or another
[15:18:45] <jrockjiggz> is there a way to submit the form with data? http://jsfiddle.net/hHqtn/21/
[15:19:08] <nFFF> Dr-Bombay, and if they were merged into one, whats the downside?
[15:19:41] <Dr-Bombay> the downside is that clients can't cache effectively
[15:20:59] <nFFF> sorry just re-read your reply
[15:21:01] <nFFF> makes sense
[15:22:58] <jrockjiggz> updated script: http://jsfiddle.net/hHqtn/22/ -- any way to submit form as to use $_GET ? i don't understand why $_REQUEST is catching data
[15:24:22] <jrockjiggz> what causes form[0] to submit and bypass the preventDefault?
[15:25:47] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I found the issue, it was a stupid hyphen that got lose
[15:34:09] <jrockjiggz> ajpiano: best i can do with your example: http://jsfiddle.net/hHqtn/24/ but i still don't get the data as GET.. which i don't understand because PHP will pickup a form submitted data with $_GET
[15:34:37] <Jon47> jrockjiggz i don't think form submission qualifies as "default" behavior, you might need to return false or stopPropagation or something in your "onsubmit" handler
[15:36:12] <ajpiano> jrockjiggz: change the form method to get, bra
[15:36:14] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/hHqtn/25/
[15:36:32] <jrockjiggz> ajpiano: ya you are right, also $_POST did work
[15:36:37] <Jon47> also if you're using php, $_REQUEST combines $_COOKIE, $_GET, $_POST, so everything will always go into $_REQUEST...
[15:36:37] <jrockjiggz> thanks mate
[15:36:54] <jrockjiggz> yea i try to avoid request
[15:38:20] <jrockjiggz> sweet :) this is great!
[15:43:56] <ThiefMaster> Jon47: actually, in recent versions it only contains GET and POST by default
[15:44:23] <ThiefMaster> and since php is "great" it's a php.ini setting so you cannot assume it to be set to a certain value if your script has to run in shared hosting environments...
[15:44:25] <Jon47> ThiefMaster: ah good to know, thanks man
[15:44:53] <ThiefMaster> and since those arrays are created before the actual script runs, ini_set() probably won't allow you to change it
[15:46:03] <Jon47> i use an app framework that requires allowed parameters to be specified explicitly in the controller, by type, so $_REQUEST never gets invoked anyway
[15:46:15] <shoky> HELO. Deferreds q: is there any good reason to call $.then() with just one deferred argument? such as $.ajax(url)
[15:46:19] <Jon47> seems like a recipe for trouble, what if the keys from multiple methods collide..
[15:46:55] <Jon47> if you use some kind of URI routing that converts a url to querystring values, you could easily clobber important info
[15:47:05] <jrockjiggz> Jon47: i can't imagine a scenario where you'd have a collision
[15:47:15] <jrockjiggz> is a collision possible?
[15:47:25] <Jon47> sure
[15:47:52] <shoky> sorry, i meant $.when()
[15:48:06] <Jon47> I use mod_rewrite in Apache so urls like "example.com/something/" get converted to "example.com?page=something"
[15:48:26] <Jon47> so on every page there's a get parameter for "page"
[15:48:54] <Jon47> now what if you also set a cookie for that key, or for some reason had an input by that name in your form
[15:49:01] <jrockjiggz> Jon47: ok i see, i guess that is the limitation of that framework
[15:49:02] <Jon47> anyway, off-topic, just saying
[15:49:26] <Jon47> i don't consider it a limitation
[15:49:57] <nFFF> shoky, so you can have multiple handlers at multiple points in the code
[15:50:12] <nFFF> handler/callbacks
[15:50:24] <shoky> cant i have them anyway just with the deferred obj?
[15:51:24] <nFFF> sorry, I was speaking entirely/generally about the defferred/promise objects
[15:51:34] <shoky> oh
[15:51:38] <shoky> k ;)
[15:52:10] <nFFF> specifically $.when(), I cant see any use beside multiple requests, for single ones just use .success
[15:52:23] <nFFF> or .done
[15:52:29] <shoky> sounds good
[15:52:31] <shoky> thanksy
[15:55:09] <nFFF> actually just googled for you
[15:55:15] <nFFF> you can create custom defferred objects
[15:55:21] <nFFF> which is cool
[15:55:42] <nFFF> so you could have an ajax request, and other customer objects, and use $.when on them
[15:56:22] <shoky> hmm not sure what you mean
[15:56:32] <nattyp> if I used load to get a remote html file should I be worried about the html, head and body tags, or will those get stripped out
[15:56:52] <nFFF> think things like fadein, and setimeouts etc
[15:57:44] <shoky> still not really sure.. what do you mean by other customer objects? other deferreds?
[15:58:57] <shoky> if i create a custom deferred, why would i need to call $.when on it?
[15:59:37] <nFFF> say you want to do some shit after a fadein has completed and a get request has completed
[16:00:28] <nFFF> http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[16:00:32] <nFFF> this is a good read
[16:00:50] <nFFF> scroll down to creating your own defferreds etc
[16:00:58] <shoky> oks. thanks
[16:01:42] <nFFF> it actually shows examples where you might you $.when on single requests
[16:01:46] <nFFF> pretty thorough article
[16:01:51] <nFFF> gl im off to bed
[16:04:06] <shoky> tanx
[16:04:07] <shoky> gnight
[16:04:58] <raj> I was going to make an example, but for some reason, nothing is showing up--> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/DjQU7/
[16:05:06] <raj> well, the slider isn't showing up at elast
[16:05:07] <shoky> raj ;)
[16:05:07] <raj> least
[16:05:14] <raj> hey there shoky :)
[16:05:34] <shoky> whats cookin
[16:06:21] <raj> if you can get that example working, I can show you!
[16:06:22] <raj> haha
[16:06:57] <shoky> heh sec
[16:08:26] <shoky> bit better now http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DjQU7/2/
[16:08:34] <shoky> you need the jquery ui css ;)
[16:08:51] <raj> oooh
[16:09:24] <nattyp> trying to get body tag from an external html file
[16:09:35] <nattyp> only works when I get the entire file
[16:09:38] <raj> shoky, so my issue is when both knobs are in the middle
[16:09:53] <raj> click+drag to whatever side should move the appropriate knob
[16:10:22] <raj> on my local page (not jsfiddle), it's a 50% chance the correct knob is on top
[16:10:42] <Whirl3d> The last knob moved to the middle should be the one on top
[16:10:50] <raj> Whirl3d, it's the opposite on my local page
[16:10:57] <raj> and on this jsfiddle, neither move
[16:11:00] <Whirl3d> wierd
[16:11:04] <IconicSchema> Anyone have IE7 that could just check something for me real quick? http://jsfiddle.net/6JYjm/6/
[16:11:16] <raj> and anyway, I want for the appropriate one to be selected, depending on the drag direction
[16:11:18] <IconicSchema> toggle state of those buttons
[16:11:58] <abnormalex1> return $.get('scripts/pages.php?func=getPage', {pageID:$nigger}, function(data) {     var $clickedPage = jQuery.parseJSON(data);     value = $clickedPage[0]['orderID'];
[16:12:17] <abnormalex1> I want to return just the value (an integer), but this is returning object Object (array)
[16:13:01] <abnormalex1> how can i have that ajax return a value from its returned data
[16:13:49] <shoky> raj it's only tricky because you'd have to meddle with jquery ui
[16:14:05] <merlin1991> someone got some material on how to generally lign out a rich "webapp" done with jquery?
[16:14:12] <shoky> er -only
[16:14:28] <merlin1991> I'm starting to question the way I structure my code :D
[16:14:43] <shoky> IconicSchema i can check in IETester....
[16:14:45] <raj> shoky, is it possible to simply overwrite that one function in a separate file?
[16:14:57] <raj> or perhaps, I should just use a different slider plugin
[16:15:03] <shoky> raj well i didnt mean to change the jqueryui code
[16:15:04] <raj> k, I saw another one I liked, so i'll try that out first
[16:15:06] <abnormalex1> how can i specifiy the data to return from ajax .get
[16:15:16] <shoky> but you'd have to figure out how it works, to know what to do
[16:15:23] <shoky> you should do that ;P
[16:15:39] <abnormalex1> rather than the entire data array, i need to return a specific part of it
[16:16:25] <shoky> abnormalex1, data.specificProperty ?
[16:16:44] <abnormalex1> shoky: but how do i return that value in the .get
[16:16:44] <shoky> assuming its json
[16:16:53] <shoky> return it where?
[16:16:57] <abnormalex1> right now I am returning my .get
[16:17:01] <abnormalex1> return $.get('scripts/pages.php?func=getPage', {pageID:$nigger}, function(data) {
[16:17:19] <shoky> returning to whom
[16:17:26] <shoky> and what do they do with it
[16:17:54] <abnormalex1> shoky: i want to return the a bit of the data
[16:18:01] <shoky> return it where?
[16:18:02] <abnormalex1> the data returned is a large array
[16:18:04] <abnormalex1> i just need one number
[16:18:05] <shoky> yes
[16:18:09] <shoky> data[23849]
[16:18:12] <abnormalex1> return it to another function
[16:18:25] <shoky> ok
[16:18:43] <daemon> good dal all
[16:18:45] <daemon> hmm
[16:18:47] <daemon> good day all*
[16:19:17] <daemon> if I load an image within the body of a html document <img src="...."/> is it possible with jquery to read the information that was laoded within that image in a binary format, i.e. read the contents of the image
[16:19:18] <abnormalex1> shoky: i can paste bin
[16:19:36] <shoky> you cant return part of the data like that
[16:19:41] <shoky> because $.get doesnt return the data
[16:19:47] <shoky> because when $.get returns, the data isnt there yet
[16:19:52] <abnormalex1> it does if i put return in front of $.get
[16:19:59] <shoky> it only exists inside your callback
[16:20:01] <shoky> as 'data'
[16:20:23] <shoky> huh.
[16:20:44] <abnormalex1> ill try to explain the situation
[16:20:49] <shoky> no dont
[16:20:52] <abnormalex1> lol
[16:21:06] <abnormalex1> im not sure what to do
[16:21:07] <shoky> you're trying to use an asynchronous method in a synchronous way
[16:21:09] <shoky> that will never work
[16:21:17] <shoky> unless you set some evil flag that i wont mention
[16:21:26] <abnormalex1> ok im trying to learn how i can use it properly, to reach my goal
[16:21:29] <shoky> ok
[16:21:40] <shoky> whatever you want to happen when the ajax request is successful
[16:21:48] <shoky> put that in your callback function
[16:22:05] <abnormalex1> well i want a global variable set
[16:22:05] <shoky> you can give a name to your callback function if you want
[16:23:00] <shoky> ok so set that global variable
[16:23:01] <shoky> inside the callback
[16:23:01] <abnormalex1> which is why i was tryingto have the entire function be the global variable
[16:23:01] <shoky> er
[16:23:01] <abnormalex1> well its actually not a global variable, but its a var outside the function
[16:23:01] <abnormalex1> and in another function
[16:23:01] <abnormalex1> im not sure how to access it
[16:23:01] <shoky> pastebin what yer trying to do, maybe i can spoonfeed you
[16:23:12] <shoky> jsfiddle even better.
[16:23:19] <shoky> so i can clickz da buttonz
[16:23:28] <merlin1991> shoky:  :)
[16:23:34] <shoky> merlin hi ;)
[16:23:40] <abnormalex1> i probably wont get it working live

[16:24:59] <abnormalex1> i just need this value value = $clickedPage[0]['orderID'];
[16:25:11] <abnormalex1> at a level outside of either function
[16:25:38] <shoky> it already is
[16:25:48] <shoky> but only after the callback is called ;p
[16:26:01] <shoky> what is it that you want to happen after the ajax call?
[16:26:04] <abnormalex1> ok the problem is, i think the ajax isnt finished yet
[16:26:10] <abnormalex1> so when I click, it doesnt return anything
[16:26:29] <shoky> you want to bind the click only after the data has arrived?
[16:26:46] <abnormalex1> umm, no but see this alert
[16:26:47] <abnormalex1> alert(clickedPageOrderID($clickedPageID));
[16:26:52] <abnormalex1> its alerting undefined
[16:26:57] <shoky> oh
[16:27:04] <shoky> didnt notice the function call there
[16:27:13] <shoky> being in an alert..
[16:27:18] <abnormalex1> haha just a test
[16:27:28] <abnormalex1> oops i didnt have the first function returning anything
[16:27:35] <abnormalex1> but i need the first function to return "value"
[16:28:22] <shoky> no, you dont
[16:28:37] <shoky> if what you want to do is alert that value
[16:28:43] <shoky> then put the alert inside the callback..
[16:29:05] <abnormalex1> ok, but really what I need to do is store that value so I can use it in another function
[16:29:13] <shoky> oh really
[16:29:23] <abnormalex1> so i geuss we can forget about the second part
[16:29:27] <abnormalex1> 1 sec
[16:29:29] <shoky> no
[16:29:36] <shoky> call that other function from inside the callback
[16:29:37] <shoky> ?
[16:29:51] <merlin1991> abnormalex1: you are already storing the value visible for other functions, what you're leaving out of the equation is time
[16:29:51] <shoky> or just:
[16:30:49] <shoky> abnormalex1 how about saying what you REALLY want
[16:31:06] <shoky> cause im sure 'using values and functions' is not what you want your app to do
[16:31:13] <shoky> nor alerting them, i hope
[16:31:14] <abnormalex1> ok here
[16:31:17] <abnormalex1> lol
[16:31:42] <abnormalex1> http://pastie.org/3807466
[16:31:44] <abnormalex1> that makes more sense
[16:31:49] <abnormalex1> not sure why I had 2 function
[16:32:38] <merlin1991> abnormalex1:  fixed it for you ;) http://pastie.org/3807470
[16:32:49] <merlin1991> actualy scrape the value = :D
[16:33:17] <abnormalex1> ok but i actually dont need to alert it
[16:33:26] <shoky> i also fixed it for you: http://pastie.org/3807475
[16:33:29] <abnormalex1> i was just demonstrating which value needs to be made available outside that function now
[16:33:35] <merlin1991> well then call some other function with the value in there
[16:33:43] <shoky> if you want it to look more like it did..
[16:34:52] <merlin1991> abnormalex1: http://pastie.org/3807480
[16:35:20] <abnormalex1> ahh taht is smart
[16:35:20] <shoky> aye
[16:35:31] <abnormalex1> except, i am going to do a similar function to that one 3 times
[16:35:36] <shoky> yes its smart
[16:35:42] <shoky> too bad you didnt hear it the first time: <shoky> you can give a name to your callback function if you want
[16:35:48] <shoky> er
[16:35:57] <shoky> i also said you can call other functions from it ;p
[16:36:03] <abnormalex1> but since im doing it 3 times, then i will do one new function with all 3 values
[16:36:07] <abnormalex1> i cant call the new function 3 times
[16:36:24] <shoky> hrm
[16:36:45] <abnormalex1> i dont know why im having so much trouble with variable scope, im not sure how to make the variable leave that function
[16:36:51] <abnormalex1> i would of thought declaring it before the function would work
[16:36:57] <shoky> its not the scope thats the issue
[16:37:01] <shoky> its TIME
[16:37:25] <shoky> get used to callbacks
[16:38:14] <merlin1991> abnormalex1: you need to trigger your handlingcode inside the callback because the callback gets exectued when the data arrives, any code you put after the end of the $.get(); call gets exectued prior in time
[16:38:25] <shoky> raj how's the slider?
[16:39:39] <merlin1991> shoky: do you happen to sit on a bunch of materials, or a good book tip for desinging a jqeury "webapp" I'm thinking not about visuals but how to split it up, what coding conventions to use, ...
[16:39:51] <abnormalex1> shoky: merlin1991 its time and scope I think
[16:40:13] <merlin1991> abnormalex1: whatever you call inside the callback has the scope of the callback --> your variable is there
[16:40:17] <abnormalex1> i can set the value after the ajax with .done
[16:40:24] <abnormalex1> but still, that value is not accessible by my new function
[16:41:11] <merlin1991> abnormalex1: I'd be delighted to see a bit more code to point you out where you go wrong (in other words show how you start using that variable)
[16:41:39] <abnormalex1> ok merlin1991 i will give that a hsot
[16:41:39] <abnormalex1> shot
[16:41:59] <shoky> merlin sorry im not your guy ;)
[16:42:09] <merlin1991> shoky: damn :D
[16:42:22] <shoky> but........
[16:42:27] <shoky> as long as you're asking
[16:42:44] <shoky> i'll recommend knockout.js ;P
[16:43:12] <Silne30> I have a question about the mouseover effect.
[16:43:50] <Silne30> I have a picture that I want to change the image when I mouse over.
[16:43:58] <Silne30> I can get that to work.
[16:44:00] <merlin1991> I've been hunting for books on proper javascript engineering for some time, but usually you get stuff abaout how to achieve $x either code wise or in the view, but never on how to lay out the code in genreal :/
[16:44:05] <shoky> for easy UI-data binding, and for a cleaner separation between pure UI code and UI behaviour (that is dependent on the data model)
[16:44:10] <shoky> @ knockoutjs
[16:44:46] <jwg2s> hey all, trying to make my css changes with animate smoother.  please check http://24.125.42.135/ for the example and click login
[16:44:50] <shoky> they have cool simple interactive tutorials !  ! !! ! !
[16:45:16] <merlin1991> currently my js code is a bunch of ui building functions and billions of lines in anonymous callback functions :D
[16:45:50] <shoky> heh
[16:45:54] <raj> damnit, the other one has the same issue
[16:45:56] <Silne30> I want a way to store the current image in a variable and then when you stop hovering restore the original picture.
[16:46:06] <shoky> raj make a new one!
[16:46:16] <merlin1991> Silne30: why not use .data=
[16:46:21] <raj> pretty sure I'm not able to do that
[16:47:01] <jwg2s> anyone check out my login bar? http://24.125.42.135/
[16:47:15] <jwg2s> i have to change some margins to keep fixed login bar with parallax scrolling
[16:47:22] <jwg2s> wondering how i can make it smoother
[16:47:28] <shoky> Silne30 just change the src attribute
[16:47:34] <shoky> back and forth..
[16:48:24] <Silne30> Right.
[16:48:31] <Silne30> HEre is the thing. I have 3 pics.
[16:48:44] <Silne30> Pic 1 is for hover pic 2 is for leaving.
[16:48:59] <Silne30> Whenever you are on a page the link has pic 3.
[16:49:46] <Silne30> '
[16:50:01] <Silne30> When I hover over pic 3. It changes to 1.
[16:50:02] <merlin1991> Silne30: .hover(function() { $(this).data('oldimg', $(this).attr('src')); $(this).attr('src', 'somepath')},function(){$(this).attr('src', $(this).data('oldimg'));}
[16:50:22] <merlin1991> and I type too slow, reading new input :D
[16:52:18] <Silne30> But then it changes to pic two when i leave the hovering state and never goes back to 3.
[16:52:36] <Silne30> Does the code above take care of that?
[16:52:54] <merlin1991> above code only works for 2 pics
[16:53:35] <Silne30>  $('#nav img').hover(function(){
[16:53:35] <Silne30>                 this.src = 'images/pawInverted.png';
[16:53:35] <Silne30>             }, function(){
[16:53:35] <Silne30>                 this.src = 'images/paw.png';
[16:53:35] <Silne30>             });
[16:53:41] <Silne30> This is what I have now.
[16:54:00] <systemfault> Silne30: How about using… CSS?
[16:54:58] <merlin1991> Silne30: that code goes from whatever the img is originally to pawinverted on hover and paw after hover
[16:55:20] <Silne30> Can I change the src of the image on hover? Is that the background-image property?
[16:55:42] <Silne30> Right, merlin1991. But On one of my links the picture is pawCurrent.
[16:56:06] <systemfault> Silne30: You would use a background image…. then change its src
[16:56:06] <Silne30> So it will change to paw and pawinverted. Never back to pawCurrent.
[16:56:17] <systemfault> Silne30: Or use a single image… and change the position..
[16:57:09] <Silne30> systemfault: So instead of having a <img> I would use a background image for the link itself? The <a> tag?
[16:57:26] <systemfault> Silne30: Yes.
[16:58:01] <Silne30> I'll give it a go.
[16:58:19] <shoky> jwg2s
[16:58:36] <systemfault> Silne30: Nobody uses javascript for hover effects nowadays :P
[16:59:04] <merlin1991> I'm starting to think I have way too many $('#someid') calls inside my widget code
[16:59:26] <abnormalex1> ok
[16:59:30] <Silne30> Oh. Ok. I am a bit new to JS and jQuery so I am probably overkilling it during the times I use it.
[16:59:34] <abnormalex1> i got the time fine i think, i just need scope
[16:59:35] <abnormalex1> http://pastie.org/3807582
[16:59:38] * merlin1991 should rtfm more on the jquery ui events
[16:59:41] <abnormalex1> how can I make value available the second time its alerted
[16:59:59] <merlin1991> abnormalex1: as I said earlier
[17:00:07] <merlin1991> the second alert is EARLIER in time
[17:00:27] <abnormalex1> shit
[17:00:40] <abnormalex1> true...
[17:00:51] <merlin1991> $.get fires off and goes to the background untill the data arrives, in the meantime the browser keeps happily executing the rest of your code
[17:00:55] <abnormalex1> what if i put the second alert outside the click function
[17:01:10] <merlin1991> then you're even more fucked
[17:01:18] <merlin1991> becuase then it will even fire before you click :D
[17:01:22] <abnormalex1> lulz
[17:01:28] <merlin1991> you need to put it inside the callback
[17:02:16] <abnormalex1> im so confused on what approach to take
[17:02:43] <abnormalex1> if only I could have the .get return an appropriate value
[17:02:59] <merlin1991> $.get('url', {somedata}, function(data) { do everything you want todo in here! });
[17:03:11] <merlin1991> that easy
[17:03:24] <systemfault> Async programming can be a pain at first..
[17:04:00] <merlin1991> systemfault: only if you do it on win with c# and m$ weird idea of "events"
[17:04:07] <merlin1991> that stuff is seriously foobar
[17:04:20] <merlin1991> well it has a point, but it's only understandable after a lot of rtfm
[17:04:26] <systemfault> merlin1991: I agree
[17:04:38] <daemon> if I load an image within the body of a html document <img src="...."/> is it possible with jquery to read the information that was laoded within that image in a binary format, i.e. read the contents of the image
[17:04:44] <abnormalex1> merlin1991: that first get gets one ID from one page. then I need to run a second get to get another ID. then i will use both IDs in another function
[17:05:08] <merlin1991> abnormalex1: put the second get into the callback of the first
[17:05:17] <abnormalex1> ok
[17:05:19] <merlin1991> and in the callback of the second get run your combined function
[17:05:34] <merlin1991> then you have everything in scope and properly timed :)
[17:05:35] <systemfault> abnormalex1: jquery has the concept of "promise" to help with that.
[17:06:18] * merlin1991 is about to learn something new, enlighten me systemfault (or jsut paste a docs link :D)
[17:06:50] <Dr-Bombay> systemfault stop using characters that are not real characters
[17:07:15] <systemfault> merlin1991: You would do: $.when($.get(……..), $.get(………)).done(function(response1, response2) { have fun with the responses });
[17:07:36] <Dr-Bombay> even in your frigging javascript code? come on
[17:07:54] <merlin1991> Dr-Bombay: maybe encoding? his code reads just fine
[17:08:32] <systemfault> merlin1991: Yes, it's the encoding,  my IRC client translates 3 dots into a single character
[17:08:55] <systemfault> His IRC client should be using utf-8 though
[17:09:37] <merlin1991> hm I wonder what encoding my client uses
[17:09:52] <merlin1991> I can force encodings, but it doesn't state its default
[17:10:07] <abnormalex1> merlin1991: i sincerley appreciate this magic
[17:10:07] <abnormalex1> http://pastie.org/3807582
[17:10:12] <systemfault> Anyway, I'll try to avoid unicode :P
[17:10:32] <ML74> could someone have a look at http://designbyml.com/washington/ and maybe give me an idea of what the problem is with the background change slowing everything down?
[17:11:09] <merlin1991> jesus, heavy lags
[17:11:10] <Dr-Bombay> what is slowing down
[17:11:38] <merlin1991> move the cursor over the menu on the bottom (horizontally)
[17:12:29] <ML74> the lag disappears when the background is removed.
[17:13:29] <systemfault> It's fine here :P (Using chrome)
[17:13:32] <Dr-Bombay> I deleted all the background images from the HTML and the cursor behaves the same
[17:13:51] <Dr-Bombay> chrome 18
[17:15:08] <Dr-Bombay> I will mention, just as an aside, that the vertical motion in the menu doesn't seem to serve any purpose and it's very difficult to keep it still
[17:15:19] <systemfault> Haha, indeed.
[17:16:16] <systemfault> The photos aren't that great… too bad they take most of the space in the design.
[17:16:35] <ML74> i reduced the quality of the photos to see if it made a difference
[17:16:40] <systemfault> Ahh ok
[17:16:47] <ML74> i thought if the file size was smaller it may load better, but no difference.
[17:17:07] <merlin1991> you might want to handle window resizes aswell
[17:17:34] <merlin1991> load with a smaller browserwindow and then enlarge and enjoy your black backgorund
[17:17:59] <systemfault> Haha, you're better at QA than me :P
[17:18:48] <Dr-Bombay> ml74: I think if you remove the images completely you'll see that the performance is the same
[17:18:58] <ML74> dr-bombay: Really?
[17:19:16] <merlin1991> systemfault: http://paste.debian.net/163605/ made me suspicious :D
[17:19:33] <systemfault> Ah :D
[17:20:28] <abnormalex1> how can i get the opposite of thisj
[17:20:30] <abnormalex1> var $nextPageID = $(this).parent('.page').next().children('.pageID').html();
[17:20:31] <ML74> huh?
[17:20:37] <ML74> merlin1991: huh?
[17:20:49] <abnormalex1> i need to get the previous div with class .pageID, inside .page,
[17:21:05] <merlin1991> ML74: resize your browser to something not fullscrenn
[17:21:08] <abnormalex1> uhh prev nevm
[17:21:08] <merlin1991> *fullscreen*
[17:21:18] <merlin1991> load the page, make it fullscreen and have a look
[17:24:41] <ML74> what's the best way to handle everything at once?
[17:24:47] <shoky> drugs
[17:25:17] <ML74> oh.
[17:28:18] <sebastian_o|> hi guys, I have an ajax call and I'd like to have in the before create the anchor element that has the onClick that creates that ajax. Possible? making $(this) doesn't work because it's the ajax object itself and this anchor doesn't have id (because are dynamically generated)
[17:29:05] <shoky> english?
[17:29:10] <shoky> grammar?
[17:29:14] <shoky> wat?
[17:29:23] <sebastian_o|> heh ok
[17:29:28] <sebastian_o|> I have an anchoe
[17:29:37] <sebastian_o|> that doesn't have id
[17:29:48] <sebastian_o|> but it has an onClick
[17:30:01] <sebastian_o|> that onClick makes a jquery ajax object
[17:30:34] <sebastian_o|> my problem is that I need to refer to the anchor in the BeforeCreate part

[17:31:22] <ajpiano> tommyent: one idea is not to paste long drupal error outputs into any channel, especially the #jquery one
[17:31:36] <tommyent> Oh shit sorry
[17:31:42] <gnarf> tommyent: yeah - don't ever ever paste that much text without using a gist / patsebin / etc in irc
[17:31:43] <gnarf> ;)
[17:32:39] <sebastian_o|> so.. as I was telling… I've tried with closest but it doesn't work (returns empty)
[17:33:30] <sebastian_o|> will try onSuccess
[17:34:27] <sebastian_o|> ah no, maybe I ca get it from the event if I observe with click()
[17:35:49] <systemfault> sebastian_o|: You're not clear enough...
[17:36:40] <sebastian_o|> yeah probably
[17:39:42] <redman> anyone looking for work???
[17:43:56] <sebastian_o|> ok got it now, thanks anyway
[17:44:48] <abnormalex1> how can I get a count of these objects
[17:44:55] <abnormalex1> {"pageID":"47","pageName":"store","menuID":"43"},{"pageID":"48","pageName":"about","menuID":"43"}]
[17:45:04] <abnormalex1> so in other words, the returned value 2
[17:45:40] <systemfault> .length ?
[17:46:17] <abnormalex1> ehh i was trying with php
[17:46:22] <abnormalex1> or is that php
[17:46:28] <abnormalex1> sorry wrong # i guess
[17:46:44] <systemfault> :/ You don't know the difference between PHP and JS? :(
[17:46:57] <systemfault> Sad..
[17:48:32] <abnormalex1> systemfault: i do
[17:49:29] <abnormalex1> sorry i cant remember if .length is valid php off the top of my head, i know like 5 languages syntax is usually the least of my concern
[17:49:45] <systemfault> It's not valid php...
[17:49:52] <abnormalex1> k
[17:49:54] <systemfault> You would use count I guess
[17:50:33] <abnormalex1> k thanks
[17:56:37] <thomedy> at this point i dont know what i have done...
[17:56:51] <thomedy> i am getting my animate() that happens 2x or 3x
[17:57:06] <thomedy> i click once it animates 2x
[17:57:12] <thomedy> and i know thats vague
[17:57:26] <thomedy> and i dont know if showing the code is specific enough
[18:01:14] <Ezek2k5> what would be the best aproach to do this. I have an image with id #logo, on mouse over  want an image to fade in on top of that one or maybe i should replace it
[18:01:21] <Ezek2k5> not sure whats the best thing to do
[18:03:02] <nvez> Ezek2k5
[18:03:07] <nvez> oops, accidental early enter
[18:03:32] <Ezek2k5> :)
[18:03:48] <nvez> could you maybe have the #logo contain a background image and have the new image inside #logo (with display none) and fade it in/out
[18:04:36] <Ezek2k5> good idea ill try that :)
[18:04:41] <nvez> not clean but works.  the other alternative is have it as background image, fadeOut(function(){swapimg(); fadein()});
[18:04:49] <nvez> so basically after the fadeout is completed, you switch pictures, and you fade it in again
[18:05:03] <nvez> that would be the cleaner way but you have to make sure you setup your callbacks so it doesnt change before animation complete
[18:05:04] <nvez> s
[18:05:26] <Ezek2k5> okk first way will do the trick i think
[18:05:29] <Ezek2k5> ty :)
[18:05:41] <nvez> np
[18:10:07] <rhino> hey guys, I've been stuck working trying to get jquery's autocomplete to work for hours.  Any idea why I keep getting the following error msg?  Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'autocomplete'
[18:10:32] <nvez> rhino: are you sure you have autocomplete loaded?
[18:10:38] <nvez> ex: the .js is included?
[18:11:15] <droope> Hello, I have a OOP javascript / Jquery scoping problem, can someone please look at my code and help me? so far - unknowingly, due to lack of var - I have been using global variables, can someone check out my code and propose an alternative? http://pastie.org/3807822
[18:11:17] <rhino> nvez:  yes, to the best of my knowledge.  would it help if I did a pastie?
[18:11:48] <nvez> sure, that might be helpful.  check error console as well that the autocomplete is being included
[18:12:06] <rhino> k, will do, 1 sec
[18:12:59] <nvez> droope: im assuming you feel that not using this. in the callback bothers you, if that's what I understand?
[18:13:22] <nvez> AFAIK, that's the way you'd have to deal with it, because you have to pass it as something else than this, or else when the callback will be executed, this will be in the context of the function itself.
[18:13:30] <nvez> then again my js is sloppy so
[18:14:35] <_zoggy_> rwldrn is quite annoying
[18:15:06] <_zoggy_> causing a lot of spam on the jquery github feed
[18:15:49] <systemfault> Who's that guy?
[18:16:03] <ajpiano> _zoggy_: he's code reviewing a massive potential change to jquery, please get a sense of priorities
[18:16:35] <shoky> yea zoggy!
[18:17:01] <_zoggy_> still. he should make a pull request or submit changes correctly rather than make a comment about each line one at a time and cause a flood of updates
[18:17:16] <ajpiano> _zoggy_: he's commenting on a pull request
[18:17:20] <systemfault> ajpiano: What change? :P
[18:17:26] <_zoggy_> just test data crap
[18:17:40] <_zoggy_> if he has that much time to comment like 'Just because it's not the source, doesn't mean it shouldn't follow the style guide LN1-9
[18:17:52] <_zoggy_> he can just as easily submit a corrected version
[18:18:10] <_zoggy_> or just sum up the whole thing saying, use jshint / use style guidelines.. whatever
[18:18:24] <rhino> nvez:  here is my pastie:  http://pastie.org/3807849 and the error msg is Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'autocomplete'  and that is the only error msg.  the includes are b/w lines 8 & 15 and the js for the autocomplete is b/w lines 192 & 220.  Finally, the html code is b/w lines 595 and 600
[18:18:26] <shoky> yea ajpiano!
[18:19:28] <rhino> nvez:   here is my pastie  http://pastie.org/3807849 and my only error is this Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'autocomplete'
[18:19:47] <shoky> and you couldn't choose ONE of the languages there for syntax highlighting?
[18:19:52] <rwaldron> Feel free to complain to me directly
[18:20:03] <ajpiano> he's the one reviewing things authoritatively for style guide compliance
[18:20:05] <_zoggy_> speak of the devil
[18:20:10] <ajpiano> if it's a huge problem for you unwatch for a little bit
[18:20:15] <rwaldron> for real.
[18:20:40] * rwaldron waiting
[18:20:44] * imsky has no idea what's going on
[18:20:48] <_zoggy_> why not just make a comment that the guy needs to follow style guideline / use jshint ?
[18:21:05] <_zoggy_> and not nit pick each line over and over causing spam for anyone watching the repo
[18:21:18] <rhino> anyone else have any idea what could cause a Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'autocomplete' error when trying to use jquery's autocomplete function?
[18:21:44] <rwaldron> _zoggy_ because if I don't identify the issues, in accordance with jQuery's style guide (which isn't some kind of default "jshint thing") issues might be missed
[18:21:56] <rwaldron> and the code will go to hell
[18:22:02] <shoky> o syntax highlighting kicked in
[18:22:17] <rwaldron> why not pick something else to complain about?
[18:22:28] <otiuk> if i want to have jquery check a script every second do i just put it after the dom ready line in a setTimeout function? or is there a better way to do it?
[18:22:32] <rwaldron> instead of whining about someone doing something positive for a project?
[18:22:35] <nvez> rhino: <script src = "./jquery/jquery.autocomplete.js"></script> == are you sure that line works?  also include type='text/javascript' for things to work well
[18:23:07] <rwaldron> _zoggy_ it's not spam if you OPTED IN.
[18:23:25] <rwaldron> any other complaints?
[18:23:28] <nvez> otiuk: by dom ready, the jquery ready? $(document).ready(…) ? if so then should be alright
[18:23:36] <nvez> poor ready, epic highlighting spree
[18:23:37] <_zoggy_> nope, just how you make your comments.
[18:24:02] <_zoggy_> quality over quantity
[18:24:07] <otiuk> nvez: that's exactly what i meant -- sorry i don't know the correct terminology with jquery yet
[18:24:16] <nvez> yep then you should be alright
[18:25:29] <rwaldron> _zoggy_ guess how much I care about your complaints right now...
[18:25:40] <_zoggy_> about as much as i care to see your spam...
[18:25:54] * rwaldron plays the smallest violin
[18:26:02] <rwaldron> I'm bored with you.
[18:26:09] <rwaldron> unwatch it until Im done
[18:26:13] <rwaldron> otherwise, zip it.
[18:26:54] <nvez> more <3
[18:27:58] <_zoggy_> <3
[18:29:12] <rhino> nvez:  I made those changes and added the fullpath for the autocomplete file, but still nothing.  Can you think of anything else?  does the order of the files matter at all?
[18:29:42] <nvez> order should kinda matter, you'd want autocomplete after jquery loads
[18:29:44] <Doonce> can jquery detect elements included through php include? because im having some issues with that.
[18:29:53] <shoky> o.O
[18:30:08] <shoky> Doonce yes.
[18:30:08] <nvez> if you go in the console and type "$("document").autocomplete -- does it return fucntion or null?
[18:30:25] <Doonce> can the script for it be in document.ready?
[18:30:32] <shoky> yes
[18:30:41] <Doonce> ok..
[18:30:58] <Doonce> http://doonce.com/test/314map/ click Where can i park.. i cant select that <a>
[18:31:18] <shoky> Doonce you do know that the browser has no idea what php was doing, yes?
[18:31:19] <rhino> nvez: it doesn't bring up anything
[18:31:28] <shoky> and jquery doesnt know more than the browser
[18:31:30] <Doonce> yes i know, which is why it doenst make sense to me
[18:31:42] <Dr-Bombay> what <a>
[18:31:48] <Doonce> lol.. it son the 1
[18:31:50] <Doonce> its on*
[18:31:52] <Doonce> one sec, ill make it bigger
[18:31:57] <rhino> nvez:  by the way, I'm doing this in the chrome console
[18:31:57] <shoky> 1?
[18:32:23] <Dr-Bombay> yeah I see it
[18:32:38] <Doonce> refresh, i made the whole list a link
[18:32:48] <nvez> rhino: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ open console and type -- $("body").autocomplete -- see how that prints out a large function?
[18:33:07] <nvez> do the same on the page of your site, if it returns "undefined", then autocomplete is not being loaded
[18:33:07] <Doonce> its in where can i park. everything in that div is loaded via php include
[18:33:14] <shoky> Doonce you cant select what <a> .. ?
[18:33:18] <shoky> o
[18:33:27] <Doonce> i wonder if its from my .load ?
[18:33:31] <nvez> Doonce: loaded via php include = ajax?
[18:33:47] <Doonce> no just <?php include();?>
[18:33:49] <sec^nd> I have a bunch of links and I want to trigger on double click, is there a way find out which element was clicked ?
[18:33:50] <nvez> if not ajax, then you dont have to worry about anything more than it being a normal page
[18:33:51] <shoky> eh.
[18:33:58] <sec^nd> I'm generating the elements by template scripts
[18:34:03] <Doonce> i know.. so why isnt it working...
[18:34:12] <shoky> Doonce you need to do some reading :\
[18:34:12] <nvez> Doonce: pastebin sample code? check error console?
[18:34:29] <nvez> sec^nd: $("a").click(function() { balbalbla(); });
[18:34:35] <nvez> im sure there is a module for detecting double clicks too
[18:34:49] <shoky> ?dblclick
[18:34:49] <bot-t> .dblclick(handler): Bind an event handler to the "dblclick" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/dblclick/
[18:34:50] <Doonce> what are you talking about? i know how to select a link, the selector isnt working.
[18:34:57] <shoky> what selector
[18:34:59] <Doonce> ive been working with jquery for a long time
[18:34:59] <rhino> nvez:  what console do you mean to type it into?
[18:35:03] <Doonce> one sec ill pastebin it
[18:35:20] <nvez> rhino: right click on anything in a page, click on inspect element, then clcik on "Console"
[18:35:31] <nvez> shoky: you learn erryday!
[18:35:37] <sec^nd> nvez: yeah but I don't have any way to know what the value of that item is
[18:35:41] <Doonce> http://pastebin.com/q13ZsqaE
[18:35:44] <nvez> yep you can
[18:35:45] <shoky> nvez: hopefully
[18:35:57] <nvez> $("a").click(function() { alert(this); }
[18:36:01] <nvez> this would be that link in the case
[18:36:08] <Doonce> that doent work.
[18:36:13] <nvez> you can get the link it points to by doing something liek $(this).attr("href") :)
[18:36:16] <Doonce> #studentcontainer does though
[18:36:18] <Doonce> just that.
[18:36:20] <shoky> yeah Doonce
[18:36:22] <rhino> nvez:  yeah, it doesn't show up, so what does that mean exactly?/how do I fix it?
[18:36:26] <shoky> ajax is asynchronous :\
[18:36:31] <shoky> .load is ajax
[18:36:39] <shoky> php has nothing to do with it
[18:36:44] <nvez> Doonce: use .live
[18:36:50] <shoky> .on
[18:36:52] <Doonce> i know, its initially in there though with php
[18:36:53] <systemfault> :/ We should call it AJAJ :/
[18:36:56] <shoky> live is deprecated/soon to be
[18:36:57] <Doonce> instead of load?
[18:37:01] <nvez> ah ok
[18:37:06] <nvez> i havent used jquery in a while :p
[18:37:08] <nvez> so.. use on!
[18:37:10] <systemfault> .on does the same as .live
[18:37:15] <Doonce> i said "i wonder if its my .load" a while ago.. so i at least had a clue..
[18:37:17] <nvez> rhino: doesnt show up aka returns "undefined" ?
[18:37:22] <shoky> Doonce not instead of load
[18:37:27] <shoky> instead of .click
[18:37:32] <Doonce> ah
[18:37:48] <shoky> like i said, you need to do some reading
[18:37:50] <shoky> see ?on
[18:37:50] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:38:16] <Doonce> ive done plenty of reading, thank you.
[18:38:31] <nvez> Doonce: that's not the best way to get help.
[18:38:37] <shoky> Doonce: EH.
[18:38:41] <shoky> i'll shut up now
[18:38:48] <Doonce> well you are insulting my intelligence.
[18:38:59] <nvez> no, he's just telling you to read more about something you don't know.
[18:39:12] <nvez> i've used jquery for over 4 years and found out today about dblclick
[18:39:16] <nvez> didnt feel insulted
[18:40:18] <Doonce> well saying "you need to do some reading" is very vague and can come across the wrong way.
[18:40:52] <nvez> it's a help channel, saying "its not working, ive done this before, i know how to do this" doesnt give a good image either and frustrates people who may be trying to help you
[18:41:23] <nvez> no one knows anything perfectly, not even the jquery core team probably.
[18:41:24] <Doonce> you were telling me i need to read how to select an anchor
[18:41:59] <rhino> nvez:  so, how do I fix the issue?
[18:42:01] <nvez> i didnt, and i said what i had to say about getting help, etc.  now you should read more about .on and how to select elements that may not be present in the dom on load.
[18:42:14] <nvez> rhino: you never answered, does it return "undefined" when you typed that cmd?
[18:42:16] <Doonce> .on doesnt work, .live does
[18:42:38] <nvez> Doonce: .on probably does, you have an old jquery version most probably
[18:42:44] <nvez> i think .on was recently introduced
[18:42:54] <nvez> so you might wanna upgrade jquery and use .on so your code doesnt break in the future
[18:43:04] <systemfault> Doonce: The jquery guys did a mistake with .on …. it does two different things.
[18:43:15] <nvez> or maybe im wrong
[18:43:15] <nvez> lol
[18:43:27] <Doonce> i have 1.7.1
[18:43:51] <Doonce> was on introduced in 1.7.2?
[18:43:58] <systemfault> Doonce: $(document.body).on('click', selectorHere, function(){});  would be the equivalent of .live
[18:43:58] <rhino> nvez:  I'm using chrome and all it says is "no results"
[18:44:14] <nvez> are you sure you're on the right console…?
[18:44:32] <Doonce> is live being deprecated?
[18:44:37] <nvez> yes
[18:44:43] <nvez> As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live().
[18:44:49] <systemfault> Doonce: Yes.. for .on
[18:45:10] <Doonce> bah humbug
[18:45:46] <nvez> rhino: http://i.imgur.com/6NHSG.png
[18:45:51] <nvez> is that what your console looks like… ?
[18:46:43] <rhino> nvez:  using chrome, I left click and then click on inspect element.  Then I click on the console btn in the dev tools and insert the text in the search bar.  Where else do I need to be doing it?
[18:46:53] <nvez> not in the search bar :p
[18:46:58] <nvez> in the little line next to >
[18:47:06] <nvez> like in the screenshot
[18:47:23] <rhino> gotcha
[18:47:25] <Doonce> ok i got .on working     i feel like i should apologize for earlier. so sorry about that, my question was misinterpreted and a weird situation arose, so i am sorry for that.
[18:48:02] <nvez> (Y)
[18:48:21] <rhino> nvez:  I got this:  function (e){var f=typeof e=="string",g=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,1),h=this;return e=!f&&g.length?a.extend.apply(null,[!0,e].concat(g)):e,f&&e.charAt(0)==="_"?h:(f?this.each(function(){var d=a.data(this,c),f=d&&a.isFunction(d[e])?d[e].apply(d,g):d;if(f!==d&&f!==b)return h=f,!1}):this.each(function(){var b=a.data(this,c);b?b.option(e||{})._init():a.data(this,c,new d(e,this))}),h)}
[18:48:32] <systemfault> wtf..
[18:48:34] <nvez> ok that means the autocomplete is actually loaded
[18:48:44] <gnarf> _zoggy_: let me just say as a contributor, i appreciate rwaldron's efforts to keep the code clean
[18:48:44] <Doonce> i said my anchor selector wasnt working, somebody said i need to read into basic selectors, i wanted to make it clear that i knew the basics.. sorry.
[18:49:17] <gnarf> to expect him to make a list as opposed to just marking the issues as they come in is a little crazy
[18:49:25] <gnarf> nevermind the feed is spammy
[18:49:39] <rhino> nvez:  so what else could it possibly be?
[18:49:42] <rhino> LOL
[18:49:45] <coldhead> surely keeping the notifications down is more important than improving the code
[18:50:06] <gnarf> ?slap coldhead
[18:50:06] * bot-t slaps coldhead around a bit with a large trout
[18:50:38] <nvez> rhino: now on that same page, if you try typing $("#tags") -- does it return the actual object (the input) or nothing? and if not, what happens if you write $("#tags").autocomplete() in the console?
[18:50:57] <gnarf> nvez: you're brave
[18:50:59] <gnarf> :)
[18:51:05] <gnarf> ?ftj @rhino
[18:51:05] <bot-t> rhino, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[18:51:13] <nvez> yes
[18:51:14] <nvez> or follow that.
[18:51:30] <nvez> master than and fix the problem :p
[18:51:35] <gnarf> rhino: look around, console.log() stuff... stick a "debugger" somewhere
[18:51:36] <gnarf> etc
[18:51:48] <gnarf> you can run console commands during a breakpoint
[18:51:54] <gnarf> so you can look at the actual element, etc
[18:52:00] <nvez> it's almost pathetic how much i dont know js
[18:52:04] <gnarf> the state of the DOM is frozen too
[18:52:05] <nvez> for how long i've used it..
[18:52:14] <nvez> "debugger" is so fkn useful
[18:52:41] <nvez> and just saw them from the slides.  so much easier than all the console.log(blah);
[18:53:25] <otiuk> nvez: here's what i've got but perhaps you can take a look?  http://pastebin.com/gjRAisKk
[18:54:18] <nvez> make sense, but that wont keep running fyi
[18:54:28] <nvez> it'll run 1 second after the page loads, settimeout runs once
[18:54:36] <nvez> my js is sloppy but check for setInterval..
[18:55:08] <systemfault> otiuk: Never use strings for setTimeout...
[18:55:15] <rhino> nvez:  when I do this:  $("body").autocomplete in my own page, it comes back as undefined, which I'm sure is the problem.  But I just downloaded it and put it on my server and am getting no errors from it
[18:55:34] <rhino> what would be causing that?
[18:55:50] <otiuk> systemfault: can you point me in the right direction?
[18:56:32] <nvez> there we go, rhino, that means autocomplete javascript module is not loaded
[18:56:37] <nvez> refresh page check in console for errors
[18:56:46] <otiuk> do i just call to a function and have the string in the function?
[18:56:57] <rhino> nvez:  that's the thing, there are no errors, LOL
[18:57:02] <shoky> systemfault: can you explain what you meant about jquery getting .on() wrong?
[18:57:28] <sec^nd> how do I create a selector for "table tbody tr .directory" .directory is the class
[18:57:34] <nvez> rhino: id start looking around trying to open that link manually
[18:57:44] <shoky> sec^nd: just like that
[18:57:48] <nvez> heh :p
[18:57:51] <min|dvir|us> Why does http://jsfiddle.net/yhhUD/4/ fade out and in?
[18:58:03] <sec^nd> nvm
[18:58:07] <rhino> nvez, I can, that's what's so wierd
[18:58:09] <sec^nd> turns out I wasn't alterting ;D
[18:58:17] <shoky> ;SS
[18:58:31] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: Because you tell it to fade out and in?
[18:58:48] <systemfault> shoky: It's simple to me, since the beginning of jQuery, there was a clear distinction in the library between 'normal event handling' and 'event delegation'. With the arrival of .on, that distinction is now blurry at best.
[18:58:50] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: so? It's all being executed at once, so it should just stay black.
[18:59:02] <min|dvir|us> "at once"
[18:59:02] <Eviltwin> No, it's not all being executed at once
[18:59:06] <Eviltwin> ?animate @ min|dvir|us
[18:59:06] <bot-t> min|dvir|us, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[18:59:09] <Eviltwin> ?queue @ min|dvir|us
[18:59:09] <bot-t> min|dvir|us, .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[18:59:16] <systemfault> shoky: It makes it a bit difficult for newcomers to get used to that
[18:59:21] <shoky> systemfault: i see what you mean yeah
[18:59:30] <shoky> thx
[18:59:37] <systemfault> shoky: You're welcome
[18:59:38] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwinahh.
[18:59:41] <min|dvir|us> That's interesting.
[18:59:54] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: ahh.
[19:00:17] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: I thought callbacks were the only way to do this?
[19:00:40] <systemfault> otiuk: Now that I'm looking at your code, don't you want .load?
[19:00:48] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: Not since jQuery 1.2
[19:00:54] <systemfault> otiuk: Also, why the setTimeout?
[19:01:00] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: that's unfortunate in my opinion.
[19:01:05] <nvez> systemfault: initially, he wanted it to run every second
[19:01:09] <otiuk> systemfault: well i need it to go off every X seconds
[19:01:11] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: see ?stop
[19:01:12] <bot-t> min|dvir|us, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[19:01:12] <min|dvir|us> I think callbacks are the only way to do this right.
[19:01:22] <Eviltwin> I'm sorry but you're wrong
[19:01:31] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: thanks for your opinion.
[19:01:32] <Eviltwin> Animations queue
[19:01:37] <Eviltwin> It's just how they work
[19:01:42] <Eviltwin> It's a feature, not a bug
[19:01:48] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: I think the feature is a bug.
[19:01:55] <Eviltwin> Then you think wrong
[19:02:00] <shoky> teh cake is a liah
[19:02:02] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: once again, duly noted.
[19:02:04] <Eviltwin> Most often than not people want their animations to queue
[19:02:11] <systemfault> nvez: Then you could use .load and recall setTimeout once you set the html
[19:02:18] <Eviltwin> If you don't want that to happen, there are options you can send to animate
[19:02:19] <systemfault> Err wrong person :/ Sorry nvez
[19:02:23] <nvez> =P
[19:02:31] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: yes, but it fights the zen of JS.
[19:02:34] <Eviltwin> "queue: A Boolean indicating whether to place the animation in the effects queue."
[19:02:42] <Eviltwin> It does not
[19:02:44] <shoky> js had a zen?
[19:02:50] <min|dvir|us> Right-o.
[19:02:59] <min|dvir|us> I can see I'm wasting my time here.
[19:03:02] <min|dvir|us> Thanks for that.
[19:03:11] <shoky> ours was not dont worry
[19:03:12] <min|dvir|us> (About .queue, Eviltwin.)
[19:03:58] <otiuk> systemfault: nvez:  newer:  http://pastebin.com/KMzAQrcm
[19:03:59] <shoky> sounds like a name for my new blog.
[19:04:24] <nvez> otiuk: imporvement, but that code with run once only
[19:04:32] <nvez> you need to setTimeout again inside the function
[19:04:32] <systemfault> otiuk: Don't pass strings to setTimeout, just the name of the function
[19:04:38] <nvez> and that
[19:04:48] <otiuk> oh ok
[19:04:54] <otiuk> i finally get what you mean
[19:04:55] <systemfault> otiuk: Also, after line 4, you can call setTimeout again
[19:05:08] <systemfault> otiuk: And it will loop the way you want.
[19:05:41] <otiuk> ok cool
[19:05:43] <shoky> someone willing to learn. refreshing
[19:05:54] <systemfault> shoky: I love that :)
[19:05:58] <shoky> ;)
[19:06:31] <systemfault> It's also amazing how much you can learn by helping people
[19:06:49] <shoky> indeed
[19:06:52] <shoky> irc++
[19:07:03] <shoky> except for freenode, of course
[19:07:14] <systemfault> Freenode is that bad? ;)
[19:07:23] <shoky> dunno i thought it'd be funny to say ;)
[19:07:45] <shoky> well it is to me!
[19:07:52] <systemfault> :D
[19:07:58] <nvez> i learned a bunch of stuff just being here today lol
[19:08:13] <shoky> ;]
[19:08:37] <nvez> i also found out that i am not as hard headed and think i know it all as some people!!
[19:08:38] <nvez> :P
[19:08:57] <otiuk> systemfault: nvez:  http://pastebin.com/weUiKuvr
[19:09:07] <nvez> baller
[19:09:08] <nvez> no try it
[19:09:10] <nvez> now*
[19:09:35] <otiuk> still no updating
[19:10:01] <otiuk> but i'm going to see if everything else is right and see what firebug has to say -- if there is an error etc
[19:10:24] <otiuk> nothing in fb
[19:10:26] <nvez> check server logs
[19:10:28] <shoky> wouldn't it be better to put the setTimeout inside the ajax callback
[19:10:45] <nvez> and see if the request is actually happening
[19:11:00] <systemfault> otiuk: What shoky said
[19:11:15] <otiuk> heh ok
[19:11:20] <otiuk> i hope it's that easy
[19:11:27] <shoky> prolly not ;p
[19:12:11] <otiuk> haha you are right.. not
[19:12:12] <otiuk> lol
[19:12:15] <shoky> :P
[19:12:25] <shoky> function(data) plz
[19:12:25] <nvez> man
[19:12:26] <shoky> not function()
[19:12:38] <nvez> i need to learn to close tabs..
[19:12:42] <otiuk> lol
[19:13:08] <shoky> what did the tabs do to you this time
[19:13:23] <shoky> closed ones scare me more!
[19:13:29] <nvez> nothing im alt+` through and there's like a gazillion of em
[19:13:35] <shoky> lol
[19:13:41] <shoky> alt+` hmm
[19:13:45] <nvez> oops my bad
[19:13:48] <nvez> cmd+`
[19:14:11] <otiuk> anyone know why my terminal and mac would be eating/adding characters on hitting space or any key really..?  that would make this process a lot faster
[19:14:24] <nvez> otiuk: using nano on remote server?
[19:14:27] <shoky> i have no idea what alt+` is doing
[19:14:28] <nvez> that always happened to me, lol
[19:14:30] <shoky> it is similart to alt-tab
[19:14:31] <shoky> but not
[19:14:35] <shoky> on win7
[19:14:42] <otiuk> nvez: yes it's been like that all day
[19:14:43] <systemfault> otiuk: Perhaps an encoding issue..
[19:14:49] <nvez> shoky: on mac, cmd+` = switch between windows, cmd+tab = switch between apps
[19:14:55] <nvez> otiuk: that always happened to me and i never ever figured out why
[19:14:56] <shoky> i see
[19:15:01] <nvez> so i switched to vim
[19:15:05] <systemfault> otiuk: Like the server being utf-8 and your terminal being iso-8859-1
[19:15:06] <nvez> and solved the problem :P
[19:15:17] <shoky> ahhh vim..
[19:15:19] <otiuk> systemfault: ok now tell me how to switch it
[19:15:25] <shoky> i keep trying to enter that lair
[19:15:33] <shoky> but i dont get past the first step or two
[19:15:35] <Whirl3d> Hey all. Quick question about Deferreds. I see how you can create custom Deferreds to facilitate callbacks (as in success and fail in AJAX), but what about init or update? Is it reasonable to store init, step, and complete Deferreds in an object in order to facilitate uniform callback handling?
[19:15:36] <nvez> its not that bad if you transition into it
[19:15:47] <shoky> but is it all that good?
[19:15:58] <otiuk> nvez: i've been dealing with it all day and it's making me want to stab people
[19:16:01] <nvez> shoky: for a terminal editor, it gives a lot of flexibiltiy
[19:16:10] <otiuk> or throw this mbp off the patio
[19:16:12] <shoky> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yes
[19:16:24] <nvez> otiuk: install cyberduck, sftp into server
[19:16:30] <nvez> edit locally in textedit or textmate or whatever you want
[19:16:31] <nvez> (Y)
[19:16:37] <otiuk> oh nice
[19:17:46] <nvez> shoky: dd to delete line, d$ to delete till end of line, capital A to insert at end of line, small a to insert 1 character next
[19:18:02] <nvez> if you do a command like dd and then hit . it will redo that command, so say you want to delete three lnies, dd . .
[19:18:07] <nvez> and i barely know any vim
[19:18:07] <nvez> heh
[19:18:08] <systemfault> nvez: Haha, vi crash course?
[19:18:10] <otiuk> systemfault: pretty sure you are spot on.. just need to google how to change it i'm sure… will be doing that shortly
[19:18:11] <shoky> heh
[19:18:18] <shoky> i'll copypaste that  thx ;)
[19:18:21] <systemfault> otiuk: What terminal do you use?
[19:18:37] <Wilornel> guys, defining a variable this way is okay, right? var $query1 = $('#input').val();
[19:18:52] <otiuk> if i could tell you i would but i just hit into terminal using spotlight and then ssh to server
[19:19:07] <shoky> Wilornel yes but why the $
[19:19:12] <shoky> in $query1
[19:19:13] <nvez> can you use $ for var names in js?
[19:19:17] <shoky> yeah
[19:19:20] <shoky> jquery does
[19:19:21] <systemfault> Wilornel: Yes, it's fine, but the convention is to prefix with a $ only when it's a jquery wrapped node/nodelist
[19:19:24] <Wilornel> It is optional?
[19:19:32] <Wilornel> oh alright
[19:19:34] <shoky> you can name a variable without a $, yea
[19:19:36] <Wilornel> But then wait a sec
[19:19:40] <otiuk> shoky:  nvez: systemfault:  http://pastebin.com/ARbQGNZ6
[19:20:00] <Wilornel> I remove the $ signs, and stil, the browser return : syntax error: unexpected identifier
[19:20:13] <nvez> check the line before it
[19:20:22] <shoky> otiuk: looks good to me
[19:20:23] <nvez> is it wrapped around <script ..> </script>
[19:20:23] <Wilornel> here
[19:20:23] <Wilornel> https://gist.github.com/2410657
[19:20:24] <nvez> pastebin?
[19:20:31] <systemfault> Wilornel: Then the error is somewhere else, are you sure you have an input with an id of "input"?
[19:20:33] <Wilornel> its in $.ajax({
[19:20:35] <nvez> Wilornel: you cant do that
[19:20:38] <otiuk> going to test it out after kill my cache and shit hold
[19:20:45] <Wilornel> Why not?
[19:20:45] <nvez> { .. } is a hash of options, you cant write code in it
[19:20:53] <raj> shoky, how can we fix this slider? :)
[19:21:00] <shoky> raj :)
[19:21:04] <shoky> hmmmmm
[19:21:06] <Wilornel> then I go $.ajax({function(){
[19:21:08] <Wilornel> ??
[19:21:14] <nvez> you would have to do it outside the .jax
[19:21:15] <shoky> i'll take a look and see if i find an easy way
[19:21:27] <nvez> do the var before the call
[19:21:28] <shoky> raj can you likn that fiddle again
[19:22:05] <shoky> nm
[19:22:09] <Wilornel> Oh cool seems like it works! :P
[19:22:13] <Wilornel> Thanks alot nvez :)
[19:22:14] <shoky> ;D
[19:22:15] <nvez> npnp
[19:23:40] <shoky> nvez, and it's common to see people name their jquery objects with a $ , like:  var $myDiv = $('#myDiv');
[19:23:47] <shoky> to signify that it's a jq obj
[19:23:56] <nvez> make sense, never did that
[19:24:05] <nvez> i feel like one of my issues is that i dont look at enough code nowadays
[19:24:12] <sec^nd> what is the best way for to submit a form with custom values ? I basically want to redirect the user to a post request
[19:24:13] <shoky> reason i asked Wilornel about it is cause he used it for a string
[19:24:29] <otiuk> i am getting a "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input" … what causes that usually?
[19:24:57] <shoky> sec^nd: fill the values in javascript and then call .submit() on that form element
[19:25:10] <raj> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DjQU7/2/
[19:25:18] <shoky> tnx
[19:25:22] <systemfault> otiuk: A missing } ?
[19:25:38] <sec^nd> shoky: how do I fill the values ?
[19:25:45] <otiuk> i am thinking it might be another jquery script calling .ready? or would that not do it?
[19:26:36] <abjorn> http://www.okcupid.com/profile/nerdladieslady
[19:26:48] <shoky> sec^nd:  var form = $('form#myFormId').get();  form.myFormInputValue = 'someCustomValue';  form.submit()
[19:26:54] <shoky> or something similar
[19:27:02] <shoky> we
[19:27:03] <shoky> er
[19:27:10] <nvez> raj: whats wrong with the slider?
[19:27:10] <shoky> form.myFormInputValue.value = 'someCustomValue'
[19:27:11] <shoky> i think
[19:27:23] <shoky> or is there a better jquery way to fill form values
[19:27:41] <nvez> $("blah").val("blah") .. ?
[19:27:54] <shoky> yeah but then you need a selector for each input
[19:27:56] <shoky> yack ;(
[19:28:08] <shoky> though
[19:28:14] <shoky> if you put it in the context of the form
[19:28:17] <shoky> i guess it ain't all that bad
[19:28:22] <nvez> $("blah", form).val("blah")
[19:28:25] <shoky> yep
[19:28:33] <shoky> thx ; )
[19:29:41] <shoky> does 'div#myDiv' get sizzled ?
[19:29:50] <nvez> sizzled?
[19:30:11] <systemfault> :/
[19:30:11] <Eviltwin> shoky: Depends
[19:30:25] <shoky> as in jquery delegates the parsing of the selector to the css selector engine 'sizzle'
[19:30:26] <Eviltwin> If the browser supports querySelectorAll it does not
[19:30:35] <Eviltwin> But otherwise it does use Sizzle
[19:30:36] <shoky> hmm
[19:30:39] <Eviltwin> I don't think there's a shortcut for it
[19:30:43] <otiuk> http://pastebin.com/TCHeEu5X   …sigh
[19:30:52] <Eviltwin> I know there's a shortcut for $("#foo") or ("#foo div")
[19:30:55] <nvez> $('#tcnt").
[19:30:57] <nvez> look closely ;)
[19:31:03] <Eviltwin> Where it uses document.getElementById("foo") first
[19:31:04] <cheeser> so I have a table cell.  when I click on it, i want to replace the cell contents with an input field/form.  i have the click handler done and getting an alert.  anyone have an example of putting that mini-form in place?
[19:31:16] <raj> nvez, I'd like for the slider to be able to be dragged in either direction when both are in the middle
[19:31:17] <shoky> cool
[19:31:21] <shoky> i should look more into that
[19:31:30] <shoky> thanks for info evasivx
[19:31:35] <shoky> Eviltwin :\
[19:31:40] <Eviltwin> The latter will still use Sizzle from that point but on only a portion of the document
[19:31:47] <otiuk> oh fuck
[19:31:51] <nvez> raj: at gotcha
[19:31:57] <otiuk> i'm blaming this stupid terminal issue lol
[19:32:50] <nvez> wow, that's a messed problem to be in, heh
[19:32:57] <shoky> ^^
[19:33:06] <shoky> how did you get there, raj
[19:33:09] <nvez> i can think of a solution but i feel like it would be overengineering the shit out of it
[19:33:19] <otiuk> nvez: http://pastebin.com/4XCt5L29 .. i put where fb puts the error
[19:33:37] <nvez> otiuk: did you wrap your code with <script> and </script>
[19:33:47] <raj> shoky, how did I get where?
[19:33:59] <shoky> whatcha gonna do with that slider mutation?
[19:34:04] <systemfault> otiuk: Missing a ) at the end
[19:34:12] <systemfault> otiuk: To close the .ready
[19:34:16] <nvez> oh yeah, that
[19:34:28] <otiuk> oh ya lol
[19:34:46] <raj> shoky, you mean edit jquery-ui source vs. a function that corrects it somehow?
[19:35:04] <nvez> raj: i think he means what context are you using that slider in :p
[19:35:10] <raj> oh
[19:35:10] <shoky> heh yes
[19:35:17] <raj> oh, to show different types of cars
[19:35:25] <otiuk> does it have to be wrapped in it's own file? .js?
[19:35:55] <nvez> not necessarily, otiuk , you can just wrap it around in <script>…</script>
[19:35:57] <shoky> hmm so why do you need two slider handles?
[19:36:07] <raj> cuz it's a range for size
[19:36:11] <shoky> ah
[19:36:18] <shoky> so you just want it to behave a bit nicer ?
[19:36:27] <raj> yep, exactly :)
[19:36:30] <shoky> cool :)
[19:37:10] <hariom> I am loading an html page using .load() and then removing some of its content to add new one. But I see that page is loaded properly but not removing the content from its one of the DOM element. If I wait for few seconds and then remove the content, it removes the content. What could be the problem?
[19:37:44] <shoky> how are you removing the content?
[19:37:55] <shoky> hm
[19:38:05] <hariom> shoky: .html('')
[19:38:16] <hariom> shoky: also tried .empty()
[19:38:53] <shoky> not sure i'm getting the whole picture
[19:39:11] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of a good vertical scroller with next and prev optinos
[19:39:13] <Forbidd3n> options
[19:40:13] <otiuk> http://pastebin.com/XTqE3UBJ .. latest.. still no updating.. fb shows it loading fine now.. #tcnt exists...
[19:40:27] <nvez> otiuk: what browser you using?
[19:40:31] <otiuk> chrome
[19:41:02] <nvez> otiuk: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1535462/debug-xhr-in-chrome-browser/1591333#1591333
[19:41:05] <nvez> check if requests are happening :)
[19:41:29] <shoky> otiuk, what's the random value for?
[19:41:44] <otiuk> shoky-- to kill any caching that could happen
[19:41:55] <hariom> shoky: $('div.banner-outer').html('').load('/search'); $('div.search_page').html('');  Here div.search_page is part of the /search html page.
[19:42:03] <shoky> ok
[19:42:24] <shoky> otiuk its not nice to say shoky--  :(
[19:42:34] <Forbidd3n> anyone
[19:42:58] <otiuk> sorry that's what i usually use "--" when addressing people.. when i type their name out
[19:43:02] <hariom> I see that div.banner-outer is loading the new page /search. but div.search_page.html('') is not able to remove html from search_page which is part of /search
[19:43:11] <hariom> shoky:^
[19:43:28] <shoky> yeah hariom..
[19:43:31] * shoky sighs
[19:43:33] <otiuk> i'll use colloquy's default
[19:43:57] <Forbidd3n> anyone on the vscroll jquery plugin
[19:44:04] <shoky> hariom: $('div.banner-outer').html('').load('/search', function() { $('div.search_page').html(''); } );
[19:44:40] <otiuk> nvez: where do i look to see if the requests are happening using the developer tools?
[19:44:49] <shoky> i think that first .html('') is redundant
[19:44:56] <shoky> actually not
[19:45:00] <otiuk> oh i see
[19:45:17] <nvez> it says it on that page, on the network tab, you can look there
[19:45:25] <systemfault> shoky: It might give the user a flash of non-content though...
[19:45:47] <shoky> systemfault if he leaves it, yeah. but that's his problem to deal with ;)
[19:45:47] <systemfault> shoky: The delay between the "html('')" and the time the ajax call ends.
[19:45:55] <systemfault> Right :P
[19:47:21] <Forbidd3n> anyone
[19:47:31] <shoky> not right now, it seems. google is up
[19:47:54] <otiuk> nvez: i see where the script shows but i don't see where i could track the requests it (is supposed) to be making
[19:48:12] <Whirl3d> Forbidd3n, most content scrollers allow you to do horizontal or vertical scrolling. Pick one and check it out.
[19:48:14] <systemfault> otiuk: Chrome?
[19:48:19] <otiuk> systemfault: yes
[19:48:33] <otiuk> poo lil wheel at the bottom
[19:49:02] <systemfault> otiuk: Open the dev tools, click the "Console" tab then right-click anywhere on the white area and select "Log xmlhttprequests"
[19:49:19] <otiuk> ok i got that rolling
[19:49:22] <systemfault> :)
[19:49:25] <otiuk> or selected
[19:49:32] <otiuk> it also works to hit the lil gear in the bottom right
[19:49:39] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[19:49:54] <otiuk> so now i refresh and where do i look for these requests?
[19:50:11] <systemfault> otiuk: They should appear in the console tab
[19:50:23] <otiuk> every second like i ask?
[19:50:24] <otiuk> haha
[19:50:31] <systemfault> otiuk: You'll get messages like: XHR finished loading: someURLhere
[19:50:45] <otiuk> ok yep
[19:51:20] <shoky> Whirl3d: regarding your deferreds q.. i'm pretty new to them myself. but i think maybe what you mean with step and complete is .progress and .always  ?
[19:51:47] <shoky> or maybe i have no idea what you meant
[19:51:47] <otiuk> systemfault: all i get is this:  http://pastebin.com/MgBv0Ahr
[19:52:33] <systemfault> otiuk: That's normal
[19:52:46] <Ezek2k5> i have a div with fixed height the content is bigger than the height, I'm trying to find a way to use an up image and a down image to scroll the content any idea what would be the best aproach?
[19:52:48] <otiuk> ok so it is looking to be working?
[19:52:55] <systemfault> otiuk: Yes sir.
[19:52:55] <otiuk> (it's not)
[19:52:58] <otiuk> hah
[19:53:03] <systemfault> otiuk: Then it's the step after :P
[19:53:09] <otiuk> haha right
[19:53:13] <nvez> alert(data);
[19:53:15] <shoky> <systemfault> otiuk: Open the dev tools, click the "Console" tab then right-click anywhere on the white area and select "Log xmlhttprequests"
[19:53:16] <nvez> see how that works out
[19:53:19] <shoky> omg that is precious
[19:53:35] <otiuk> hahaha
[19:53:38] <systemfault> nvez: You deserved to be kicked your butt :/
[19:53:47] <systemfault> -d
[19:53:47] <nvez> cfine
[19:53:51] <nvez> console.log(data);
[19:54:41] <systemfault> otiuk: Passing a callback to $.ajax is the old uncool way
[19:54:54] <systemfault> otiuk: So I don't even remember the kind of object you get back
[19:55:01] <shoky> jqXHR
[19:55:04] <systemfault> Ah!
[19:55:15] <systemfault> Then he wants data.responseText I guess..
[19:55:26] <shoky> aduno
[19:55:29] <otiuk> no alert
[19:55:49] <otiuk> hold for pastebin
[19:55:57] <Forbidd3n> Whirl3d: can't seem to find one that does multiple images
[19:56:03] <nvez> blah getting tired
[19:56:05] <nvez> gonna go crash
[19:56:09] <nvez> night gaize
[19:56:14] <systemfault> Night!
[19:56:18] <Forbidd3n> with custom next / prev anchors
[19:56:19] <otiuk> http://pastebin.com/42T5xpK8
[19:56:22] <Forbidd3n> like malsup
[19:56:50] <nvez> oh wow
[19:56:51] <nvez> um
[19:56:57] <nvez> jQuery.ajax( url [, settings] )
[19:57:02] <shoky> night nvez
[19:57:02] <nvez> settings != callback
[19:57:02] <systemfault> otiuk: If shoky's right, then you probably want: $("#tcnt").html(data.responseText);
[19:57:07] <nvez> so, success.
[19:57:11] <systemfault> Ah!
[19:57:11] <gnarf> jQuery.ajax( url ).done( callback )
[19:57:28] <gnarf> ?deferred.done
[19:57:28] <bot-t> deferred.done(doneCallbacks, [doneCallbacks]): Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is resolved. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[19:57:30] <systemfault> Like gnarf says :D
[19:57:35] <otiuk> oh no i'm really not understanding what to try next
[19:58:09] <gnarf> also
[19:58:18] <otiuk> ok switched from .ajax to .post
[19:58:22] <otiuk> works
[19:58:25] <gnarf> ?sop @otiuk
[19:58:26] <bot-t> otiuk, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[19:58:55] <systemfault> otiuk: Using post to get a page?!?
[19:58:56] <gnarf> its bad practice to use full domains
[19:59:03] <shoky> wait wat.
[19:59:11] <gnarf> otiuk: use jQuery.ajax( url ).done( callback )
[19:59:31] <gnarf> the $.post and $.get are kinda lame
[20:00:11] <hariom> shoky: That has worked. Thank you
[20:00:19] <shoky> hariom np
[20:00:23] <otiuk> ok so i don't leave it $.post now that it's working i use jQuery.ajax(url).done(callback)?
[20:00:36] <otiuk> i am tempted to not touch it
[20:00:37] <otiuk> lol
[20:00:42] <gnarf> ?101 @otiuk
[20:00:43] <bot-t> otiuk, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[20:00:43] <systemfault> LEave it as .post
[20:00:49] <gnarf> ?learn @otiuk
[20:00:49] <bot-t> otiuk, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[20:01:09] <otiuk> haha yes mozilla development writing sounds like what i want to read
[20:01:28] <otiuk> i will bring up the latter
[20:01:42] <gnarf> ?facepalm
[20:01:43] <bot-t> gnarf, Couldn't find "facepalm" in jQuery Docs.
[20:01:47] <shoky> lol
[20:01:50] <otiuk> lol
[20:02:03] <gnarf> so mozilla mdn is a wiki
[20:02:14] <otiuk> i'll take your word for it
[20:02:16] <gnarf> and people pay a good amount of attention to finding good links on that learn one
[20:02:56] <otiuk> hah i remember sending people to netscape/mozilla doc back in the 90's :P
[20:03:18] <shoky> you got served right
[20:03:20] <billygalbreath> Me: I want to learn to fly a plane! Pilot: First you're going to want to take a class on aerodynamics, then .... Me: What? I said FLY a PLANE. I think I'll start with that.
[20:04:04] <gnarf> otiuk: i guess what I'm saying is, if you don't understand what it means to do jQuery.ajax( url ).done( callback ) in that code, you really need to learn a little about JS first
[20:04:28] <otiuk> gnarf: i understand what you mean and i agree
[20:08:08] <imsky> otiuk: old school eh
[20:10:17] <Whirl3d> Forbidd3n, seriously? http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+vertical+slider+plugin
[20:10:33] <Whirl3d> I have tried about 4 of those and they all seem to work pretty well.
[20:10:55] <_zoggy_> gnarf, i never said anything was wrong with the comments he leaves or the validality of whats said. just the uneeded spam of x comments for the same pull. he could have just as easily made a comment to the pull request asking the person to follow style guidlines/whatever than break down each file each line on whats wrong. just seemed a bit excessive
[20:11:03] <shoky> Whirl3d did what i say make sense?
[20:11:10] <shoky> i am curious
[20:11:24] <Whirl3d> when?
[20:11:36] <_zoggy_> its about the same thing as someone who hits enter after ever few words in a chat room.. rather than writing a line out. just presentation
[20:11:40] <shoky> [05:51:20] <shoky> Whirl3d: regarding your deferreds q.. i'm pretty new to them myself. but i think maybe what you mean with step and complete is .progress and .always  ?
[20:11:40] <shoky> [05:51:48] <shoky> or maybe i have no idea what you meant
[20:12:01] <gnarf> _zoggy_: but you see, when i make a push and there are 8 lines wrong, he saves me the trouble of having to find all 8, or if one of the other contribs decides to merge it he can do so and then have a quick guide to fixing the whitespace
[20:12:10] <Whirl3d> I didn't even see that reply. Thanks shoky.
[20:12:22] <shoky> no sweat
[20:12:28] <shoky> i am learning too
[20:12:39] <Whirl3d> Actually, I am creating a custom deferred for animate...where on occasion, I need to initialize and element before animating it
[20:13:08] <shoky> hmm initializing doesn't sound liek something you'd wanna defer?
[20:13:23] <Whirl3d> so I figured that if I had a deferred object that when resolved indicated that the element was in the required "init" state, it would just skip any init steps
[20:13:25] <_zoggy_> i see. you cant be bothered on following rules/use tools youd rather someone else dictate everything for you?
[20:14:01] <Whirl3d> _zoggy_, YOU are spamming up the channel with your incessant banter about your personal preferences.
[20:14:13] <shoky> Whirl3d i havent used it at all but that sounds kinda like .progress . but i must read too
[20:14:23] <_zoggy_> Whirl3d, troll harder.
[20:15:37] <_zoggy_> i unwatched the repo as suggested, so no more issue. and narf responded so i responded back. this is a chat room after all.
[20:15:48] <coldhead> oh god are we still talking about this
[20:16:15] <coldhead> freenode is a privilege, not a right. and you have the privilege of being more entertaining
[20:16:20] <coldhead> i'm sorry but that's just how it is
[20:16:23] <coldhead> i don't make the rules etc
[20:17:41] <shoky> coldhead-+
[20:17:52] <Acrack> yo
[20:17:56] <shoky> sup bra
[20:18:09] <Acrack> got problemzor
[20:18:13] <shoky> :D
[20:18:25] <shoky> $_$
[20:18:25] <billygalbreath> losing irc privileges suck. i've been banned for life from 3 networks.
[20:18:36] <shoky> must be your breath
[20:18:41] <billygalbreath> must be
[20:18:48] <shoky> asl?
[20:18:53] <coldhead> being banned from ##php is a good thing
[20:18:58] <systemfault> Sure.
[20:19:00] * imsky is banned from a few chans on freenode
[20:19:07] <coldhead> respect
[20:19:23] * imsky is banned from #html
[20:19:29] <shoky> ouch
[20:19:32] <billygalbreath> hah
[20:19:36] <Ezek2k5> i have a div with overflow: scroll; is there a way to hide the scroll and use 2(up/down) buttons to scroll?
[20:19:38] <coldhead> feels goodman!
[20:19:38] <imsky> they couldn't handle my style
[20:19:48] <billygalbreath> Ezek2k5: yes
[20:19:48] <Acrack> http://pastie.org/3808245 here is the problem with this little code, if i mouseover answer-block it ll show all the remove-answer div :s
[20:20:15] <Acrack> i want it to show only remove-answer of "this" answer-block
[20:21:01] <Ezek2k5> billygalbreath how i can do it? using positions or ?
[20:21:04] <Acrack> anybody got an idea ?
[20:21:21] <shoky> Acrack: $(this).show() ?
[20:21:31] <Whirl3d> Ezek2k5, check out ariel Fleischer's ScrollTo plugin
[20:21:31] <billygalbreath> Ezek2k5: I dont know _how_ to do it, but I've used jQuery plugins that do this for me. so I know its possible
[20:21:45] <shoky> or $(this).parent or whatever
[20:21:48] <otiuk> hey thanks shoky, nvez, systemfault, gnarf for all the help :)
[20:21:50] <Whirl3d> ?.scrollTo
[20:21:51] <bot-t> Whirl3d, .scroll() - Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[20:21:56] <otiuk> _much_ appreciated
[20:22:01] <billygalbreath> Ezek2k5: jScrollPane is my favorite, but might be bloated for some people.
[20:22:06] <shoky> been a pleasure otiuk
[20:22:14] <Acrack> shoky: $(this).show($('.remove-answer'));
[20:22:18] <Acrack> u mean like this ? XD
[20:22:21] <Ezek2k5> ok ty ill try that out
[20:22:31] <shoky> i donno i'm tired :\
[20:22:33] <otiuk> shaky; you don't have to lie ;)
[20:22:37] <shoky> ;)
[20:22:44] <shoky> shakyn dat ass
[20:23:13] <Acrack> shoky ?
[20:23:23] <Acrack> i don't understand your "this" thingy
[20:23:50] <shoky> nor i yours
[20:23:57] <Acrack> :D
[20:24:01] <shoky> ;p
[20:24:02] <Acrack> lemme reexplain
[20:24:18] <coldhead> It's perfectly simple. If you're not getting your hair cut, you don't have to move your brother's clothes down to the lower peg. You simply collect his note before lunch, after you've done your scripture prep, when you've written your letter home, before rest, move your own clothes onto the lower peg, greet the visitors, and report to Mr. Viney that you've had your chit signed.
[20:24:24] <otiuk> now to figure out this encoding issue i think I'm having like systemfault mentioned
[20:24:30] <shoky> o shiat
[20:25:09] <Acrack> http://pastie.org/3808245 with this code, if i "mouseOver" on div "answer-block", it will show all existing div "remove-answer", i want it to show only div "remove-answer" linked to THIS answer-block
[20:25:22] <shoky> coldhead plz go on
[20:25:36] <billygalbreath> Acrack: i told you last night if you make a jsfiddle that shows _more_ code than just a bare minimum example then maybe I can help you. you keep showing too little code for the questions you keep asking, imo.
[20:25:53] <Acrack> ok sec :p hahaha
[20:26:02] <Acrack> sorry im not used to irc yet ^^
[20:27:26] <coldhead> you'll get the hang of if, Acrack
[20:27:50] <Whirl3d> You are fortunate to find this channel. Folks here are really helpful and patient.
[20:29:11] <coldhead> THE HELL WE ARE
[20:29:15] <coldhead> oh sorry, wrong window
[20:31:34] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/8vWFD/4/
[20:31:34] <coldhead> hey snovesy
[20:31:37] <Acrack> here it is xD
[20:33:40] <Acrack> mouseover isn't working
[20:33:46] <Acrack> mouseout i mean
[20:33:52] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/8vWFD/7/
[20:33:56] <rhino> nvez:  tnx for your help, I finally figured out the problem.  The idiot I replaced had placed some script src links towards the end of the page and that's what was preventing the autocomplete from properly loading
[20:33:56] <shoky> @Acrack
[20:34:32] <Acrack> thanks this is exactly what i needed !
[20:34:47] <shoky> fiddle first next time ;P
[20:34:54] <coldhead> that's what she said
[20:34:57] <shoky> ;D
[20:35:22] <billygalbreath> lol
[20:39:22] <Acrack> yea ^^
[20:44:22] <coldhead> hey k1ng
[20:44:29] <coldhead> you're a blast from the past
[20:45:20] <coldhead> Re: Ordernow,pricesaregettingaffordable!
[20:48:20] <billygalbreath> random question time: do you guys use single or double quotes? is one better than the other? I seem to use both, more often mixed in the same code. I'm a flip-flopper.
[20:48:59] <Whirl3d> <==flipflopper in the worst way...
[20:49:35] <amirite> single or double quotes don't make a difference in javascript since js doesn't interpolate variables in double
[20:49:53] <shoky> i like using ' as default and " as inner quotes. ' doesnt require shift-key and is a more minimal char
[20:49:59] <samzhao_> it all comes down to personal preference?
[20:49:59] <shoky> MAN that sounds geeky
[20:50:01] <amirite> me too
[20:50:03] <lcj> very new to jQuery here - I ahve 'this' (I'll get that later...): "$("nav .menu ul li a").each(function() { [...]" I don't want to select the children. I only want what is on that level - how do I do that?
[20:50:45] <shoky> what children?
[20:51:01] <billygalbreath> lcj: jsfiddle.net
[20:51:17] <lcj> shoky: nav .menu ul li a ul li
[20:51:38] <shoky> that shouldn't be selecting the inner ul and li..
[20:51:44] <Whirl3d> .not($(this).children());
[20:51:53] <shoky> wat
[20:52:11] <shoky> guess im too tired
[20:52:59] <coldhead> ew
[20:53:22] <shoky> ?
[20:53:34] <billygalbreath> he barfed lillies again
[20:53:39] <Whirl3d> I think I normally put the embedded ul li outside the <a> element, but inside the li element.
[20:53:48] <billygalbreath> wait - wrong channel
[20:53:58] <shoky> larfed billies
[20:54:28] <billygalbreath> shoky: whats the fascination with my name?
[20:54:48] <shoky> i noticed its your name only after typing
[20:54:52] <shoky> consciously at least
[20:54:59] <shoky> sorry, you're an pretty kewl
[20:55:12] <jrikta> if i'm writing a module that makes use of jquery is there any reason not to attach it to the jquery namespace?
[20:56:08] <systemfault> jrikta: Usually, you would attach library code to the jquery object, not user code.
[20:56:11] <Phoon> What's the clean way to select an element and all of its children?
[20:56:25] <Phoon> Actually, a group of nodes and all of their children?
[20:56:48] <amirite> var element = jQuery('#element'), element = element.add(element.children())
[20:57:00] <shoky> $('*', element) ?
[20:57:09] <shoky> mm
[20:57:14] <jrikta> systemfault: user code being the global namespace?
[20:57:15] <shoky> would that work
[20:57:21] <systemfault> amirite: .children is only one level deep IIRC
[20:57:30] <amirite> that's what he asked for
[20:57:34] <systemfault> Ah ok.
[20:57:51] <Phoon> Actually, I wanted all descendants, heh. Thanks for pointing out the problem.
[20:57:56] <shoky> well when he says all of his childern
[20:58:02] <shoky> yeah he prolly means all descendants
[20:58:08] <systemfault> jrikta: User code being code that isn't really reusable that uses jquery
[20:58:13] <shoky> well not 'his' children ;S
[20:59:07] <billygalbreath> $(this).grandchildren().greatgrandchildred().greatgreatgran......
[20:59:30] <billygalbreath> ignore me. i'm being stupid out of boredom
[20:59:32] <systemfault> shoky's way work… even though I'd personally use .find in that case.
[21:00:07] <Phoon> So it'd be  $(selectedelements).add($(selectedelements).find()) ?
[21:00:31] <shoky> no
[21:00:39] <shoky> from .find docs:
[21:00:45] <shoky> Unlike in the rest of the tree traversal methods, the selector expression is required in a call to .find(). If we need to retrieve all of the descendant elements, we can pass in the universal selector '*' to accomplish this.
[21:01:06] <Phoon> Oh.
[21:01:21] <Cork> $('#element, #element *') should give you what your after
[21:01:30] <Phoon> $(selectedelements).add($(selectedelements).find("*")) then.
[21:01:43] <billygalbreath> i always thought grabbing an element effects its children as well. kinda like if you pick up a toolbox and move it the tools inside of it go with it instead of just falling to the floor...
[21:01:43] <Phoon> Cork: The selected elements might be any number of selectors
[21:01:56] <Phoon> billygalbreath: That's what I thought too, but apparently it doesn't work that way
[21:02:13] <billygalbreath> weird
[21:02:28] <Phoon> on http://bgeiger.net/jstest.html I've been running a script that affects #black
[21:02:30] <Cork> billygalbreath: what are you doing?
[21:02:50] <Cork> (or who ever it is doing it :D )
[21:02:52] <Phoon> it gets the div but not the a within
[21:03:12] <Phoon> Cork: I'm trying to write a basic whitelisting/blacklisting script for xss prevention, for a class project
[21:03:43] <Phoon> The idea is that people share blacklist/whitelist info in the forms of selectors
[21:03:59] <Cork> you don't want to use inline events
[21:04:15] <Phoon> then the plugin loads these selectors and removes all on[foo] attributes and all script elements
[21:04:21] <Cork> what you need to do is use event listners and prevent the event bubbling
[21:04:22] <Phoon> Eh?
[21:04:40] <Phoon> Wut?
[21:04:55] <Cork> one sec i'll wipp up a fiddle
[21:05:00] <Phoon> Thanks.
[21:05:16] <Phoon> I was about to say "explain like I'm 5"...
[21:07:34] <codeshah> hey gys, when I call a $.get … the callback is that processed even if I move on to a second page before the callback comes?
[21:07:56] <Acrack> got new prob o/
[21:08:01] <shoky> :)
[21:08:04] <systemfault> codeshah: Why would it be?
[21:08:11] <systemfault> codeshah: Since you changed the page..
[21:08:18] <markq> codeshah: no
[21:08:20] <codeshah> well, I thought it was an async call thats why
[21:08:28] <shoky> :))
[21:08:31] <markq> the code is dead
[21:08:37] <codeshah> 'cause when I log in, I call an indexing function .. and that may take 20-30 seconds to run and return a response
[21:08:39] <codeshah> hmm … k
[21:08:43] <Cork> Phoon, billygalbreath: http://jsfiddle.net/H7ZgX/
[21:08:48] <markq> you've dismissed the js engine from having that in the execution loop
[21:08:57] <markq> execution context*
[21:08:58] <billygalbreath> codeshah: it is async, but the listener is gone once you change page so the result goes to null
[21:09:17] <systemfault> codeshah: Then you're doing something wrong on the server side….. Response should return right away.
[21:09:18] <codeshah> hmm I see I see… any workarounds? I guess probably not unless server side?
[21:09:28] <codeshah> systemfault: I am returning a response after indexing is complete…
[21:09:42] <codeshah> systemfault: but I guess I should have a fxn that returns true/false to say whether it indexed or not
[21:10:01] <systemfault> codeshah: Something like that, yes.
[21:10:15] <Phoon> Cork: Hrm. I don't have control over the actual page being loaded. I'm using jQuery inside a Firefox plugin.
[21:10:17] <Cork> Phoon: note thought, you shouldn't build a xss protection in js, that makes for a quite lousy solution thats easy to work around
[21:10:20] <systemfault> codeshah: A status resource that you can poll every X seconds.
[21:10:26] <codeshah> systemfault: yup…
[21:10:42] <Phoon> Cork: Yeah, I know, but this is a one-semester class project.
[21:11:08] <Cork> Phoon: you should prob hook into firefox instead of the dom
[21:11:20] <Phoon> Cork: I have no idea how. :-(
[21:11:26] <Cork> Phoon: cause if you add event listners to the dom they can be found and removed
[21:11:32] <Cork> Phoon: have a look at noscript
[21:11:35] <shoky> night folks
[21:11:45] <Cork> it has this built in, and is a better solution
[21:11:54] <Cork> (for secutiry)
[21:11:56] <Phoon> Cork: I have. It's tangled code. I can't figure it out.
[21:12:07] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/8vWFD/10/ here is the js code, when i replace the actual html by a generated one thanks to ajax, the truncable thingy don't work anymore
[21:12:34] <Cork> Phoon: it hooks into the core of firefox, so ya, it becomes a bit wieldy
[21:13:22] <Phoon> Cork: Precisely. This isn't meant to be a major project. It's for academic purposes, not for real use.
[21:13:41] <Acrack> Cork earlier you told me about a way to use JS cause of some generated code
[21:14:11] <Cork> Acrack: you mean the delegated listner?
[21:14:23] <Acrack> but i didn't manage to use your way $(document).on('click', '.good-answer', function() {
[21:14:48] <Acrack> truncable is working good, but when the page refresh itself with ajax
[21:14:53] <Acrack> it isn't working anymore
[21:15:32] <Cork> Acrack: uh, you mean modifies it self i hope
[21:15:41] <Cork> cause you don't refresh the page with ajax
[21:15:48] <Acrack> yy modify itself :)
[21:16:02] <Acrack> ajax overrite the actual content :D
[21:16:09] <Acrack> and the function don't work anymore
[21:16:22] <Acrack> but in the new content there is that class="answercontent"
[21:16:24] <Cork> you need to retrigger the trunkcation
[21:16:30] <Acrack> how ?
[21:16:41] <Cork> bu running it in the success callback
[21:16:42] <Cork> *by
[21:16:54] <Acrack> lol (im noob in js bro)
[21:16:58] <Acrack> could you give me an exemple
[21:16:59] <Acrack> ?
[21:17:10] <Cork> i would have to see your ajax call first
[21:17:20] <Acrack> ok sec
[21:17:34] <billygalbreath> you need to add the event listeners to the newly created elements that are created
[21:17:54] <billygalbreath> the listeners are tied to the old ones, which no longer exist after ajax does its thing
[21:18:04] <Cork> billygalbreath: its not an event listner
[21:18:11] <Acrack> this is the ajax : http://pastie.org/3808475
[21:18:13] <billygalbreath> onmouseover?
[21:18:23] <Cork> its a trunkaction plugin
[21:18:34] <billygalbreath> oh
[21:18:43] <billygalbreath> i thought he was still talking about the mouseover stuff
[21:18:58] <Cork> Acrack: after line 54
[21:19:08] <billygalbreath> trunkaction probably loads on document.ready so he'll need to re-initialize it again after ajax does its thing
[21:19:09] <Cork> add the truncate command again
[21:19:24] <Acrack> ok sec
[21:20:14] <Whirl3d> I've probably asked before, but I can't seem to find it easily. Is there an easy way to only extend certain properties of an object with the same properties of another object without having to iterate through each property?
[21:20:34] <Acrack> Cork works perfect :p
[21:20:38] <Cork> Whirl3d: you mean like a filter?
[21:21:07] <Acrack> thanks
[21:21:11] <Cork> np
[21:21:28] <Whirl3d> not sure...I was thinking along the lines of $.extend({},firstObj, secondObj), but the second object has a lot of extra crap in it
[21:22:28] <Cork> Whirl3d: you only want the values from the secondObj that exist in fitsObj?
[21:22:56] <Whirl3d> so I can do a for-loop    for (var prop in firstObj) { thirdObj[prop]=secondObj[prop]||firstObj[prop]}
[21:23:23] <Whirl3d> cork, yes.
[21:23:51] <Cork> Whirl3d: extend is a for loop, but no there isn't a code that does this
[21:24:00] <Cork> *command
[21:24:32] <Whirl3d> cool enough. Thanks for the help
[21:24:48] <Phoon> How do I get the tag name of $(this)?
[21:24:49] <Cork> Whirl3d: btw remember that nested objects isn't extended normally
[21:25:00] <Cork> Phoon: this.nodeName
[21:25:15] <Whirl3d> right, $.extend(true, {}, first, second);
[21:25:32] <Cork> and that makes the filter even more complex :)
[21:25:42] <lcj> shoky, Whirl3d, billygalbreath - thanks for the answers before - http://jsfiddle.net/lasseclaes/Y3hE5/8/ (((//populate....) - I don't want the children of 'nav .menu ul li a'
[21:25:51] <Phoon> Cork: ... comes back 'undefined'
[21:26:11] <Phoon> so does .name
[21:26:41] <Cork> Phoon: as long as this is the dom element this.nodeName should work
[21:26:52] <Cork> and no name isn't the same thing
[21:26:54] <Phoon> ... oh, so I need to .get(0) first
[21:27:04] <Cork> if you have this, no
[21:27:10] <Phoon> not this, $(this).
[21:27:12] <Cork> just remove $()
[21:27:19] <Phoon> as in, passed to .each()
[21:27:51] <Cork> $('selector').each(function() { this.nodeName });
[21:28:13] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Y3hE5/10/
[21:28:28] <Phoon> Ah, now I get it.
[21:28:45] <Phoon> I thought the name $(this) was magic
[21:28:50] <Cork> nope
[21:28:56] <Whirl3d> lcj, by adding the > between heirarchical elements, you are saying select this element immediately under the last one. I think.
[21:29:03] <Cork> Phoon: it takes the dom element this and wrapps it in a jquery object
[21:29:39] <Whirl3d> so .menu ul>li>a will only select the first level of the menu in your example.
[21:29:43] <Phoon> Anyway, followup question: I want to take the contents of a child/descendant of a node and replace the node with it. (Specifically, I want to replace <script> <noscript>foo</noscript></script> with "foo"
[21:30:31] <Cork> Phoon: you know that replacing a script tag has no effect after its been parsed right?
[21:30:40] <lcj> thanks a bunch Whirl3d!
[21:30:48] <Whirl3d> np
[21:30:56] <Phoon> Cork: Really?
[21:31:01] <Cork> yup has
[21:31:10] * Cork wacks his client
[21:31:28] <Cork> Phoon: the parser and js engin is two seperat things
[21:31:39] * Whirl3d thinks coldhead wants to be Cork's client...
[21:31:47] <Cork> when a script is loaded its part of the scope it was loaded in, and has nothing to do with the dom
[21:32:40] <Cork> Phoon: document.write is a hack it has special code that locates where the script tag was and outputs in relation to that
[21:32:56] <Cork> except for that, js has no knowlage what so ever about where it was loaded from
[21:32:57] <snover> hax
[21:33:07] <snover> unless you are using firefox
[21:33:26] <Cork> Phoon: it can't even tell if it was loaded from an external file or inline
[21:34:01] <snover> Cork: everything you are saying is only true if the scripts are defer or injected after initial page load
[21:34:10] <snover> otherwise you can just look at whatever is at the end of document.scripts
[21:34:17] <snover> and that is the currently processing script
[21:34:24] <snover> ?tmyk
[21:34:25] <bot-t> The More You Know 彡☆
[21:35:09] <Cork> snover: you can find script tags yes, but the code doesn't depend on them
[21:35:41] <Phoon> Bugger.
[21:35:48] <Phoon> So much for that idea, then.
[21:36:52] <Cork> Phoon: so you need to hook into before the script is loaded, if you want to prevent it
[21:37:19] <Phoon> Cork: Yeah. Problem is, I don't know if this can be done using the new API
[21:37:25] <Cork> Phoon: you could look at csp
[21:37:28] <Phoon> csp?
[21:37:33] <Whirl3d> The Island Pt. II (Dusk) by Pendulum is my new favorite song for five minutes!
[21:37:39] <Cork> content script policy
[21:37:49] <Whirl3d> sry, wrong window
[21:38:08] <Cork> Phoon: the server can send this as a header to the client, and modern browsers will ex. not load scripts from other domains
[21:38:13] <Cork> or even run inline scripts
[21:38:19] <Cork> depending on your settings
[21:38:31] <Phoon> Cork: Google knows not of such things. :-/
[21:38:38] <Acrack> new problem \o/
[21:40:20] <Cork> Phoon: lets see if i can find the correct header (theres several part of csp)
[21:40:40] <Phoon> You mean Content Security Policy?
[21:41:13] <Cork> Phoon: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP/CSP_policy_directives
[21:41:31] <Cork> Phoon: ya, script was wrong :)
[21:42:43] <jrockjiggz> is there a way to trace a script step-by-step (like firebug) for after a button is clicked?
[21:42:50] <Phoon> Interesting, but keep in mind that (1) I don't have access to the server, and (2) I want to do this on a node-by-node basis.
[21:43:02] <Phoon> CSP seems like it's rather all-or-nothing.
[21:43:25] <Cork> yes its a way to add extra security to a site
[21:43:47] <Cork> but like i said you can't really prevent xss from inside js on a page
[21:44:10] <Cork> your fix would only work until someone detected it, then they could just simply remove you
[21:44:27] <Phoon> Not if the JS in question is running inside a plugin.
[21:44:48] <Cork> if your doing it by jquery on the page yes
[21:45:00] <Phoon> The assumption is that the site owner isn't malicious, and if the plugin works properly, XSS attackers won't have the chance.
[21:45:01] <Cork> cause you would have to add your fixes to the content page
[21:45:07] <Cork> else you can't catch events
[21:45:48] <Cork> so only way you can even remotly reliably prevent it is by working with privilged js
[21:46:00] <Cork> and not with the content page at all
[21:47:35] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/8vWFD/14/ how to make just one loading and the other one disapear ?
[21:49:11] <Cork> Acrack: http://jsfiddle.net/8vWFD/16/
[21:50:10] <Acrack> yep thanks gonna try it on line
[21:50:13] <Acrack> live*
[21:51:20] <Acrack> not(this) ?
[21:51:29] <Acrack> or not$(this)
[21:51:36] <Cork> not(this)
[21:51:38] <Acrack> ok
[21:51:54] <Cork> it removes the current clicked element from the selection
[21:52:07] <Cork> so you later can use replaceWith on it
[21:52:17] <Acrack> perfect !
[21:52:30] <Cork> Acrack: alternativly you can have a parent you use .html on
[21:52:38] <jrockjiggz> when i load ajax, i get these weird added links in firebug script /event/seq/3/anonymous http://dygmm.servehttp.com/screenshots/2012-04-18_00-51-43.png an ideas?
[21:52:39] <Cork> would solve it too
[21:52:43] <Acrack> yea
[21:52:47] <Acrack> thanks again
[21:53:24] <Acrack> Cork is there some way to speedup page loading ?
[21:53:35] <Acrack> seems my page is slower since i added many JS codes
[21:53:43] <Cork> ya
[21:53:53] <Cork> but theres not a magic bullet
[21:54:21] <Cork> if you load a lot of files from the header that will slow down the page load
[21:54:40] <Acrack> i see
[21:54:43] <Cork> jrockjiggz: your loading html with ajax?
[21:54:54] <samzhao_> require.js
[21:55:30] <Cork> those lines look like inline script tags
[21:55:57] <Acrack> also, when i don't want a link to do something you put # on href ? like href="#" ?
[21:56:06] <Cork> no
[21:56:09] <Acrack> cause it is annoying, when i click on those links i go back at top of page
[21:56:13] <Cork> you use spans with css
[21:56:39] <Cork> i think i've told you like 5 times to not use a tags if you don't want links >_<
[21:57:09] <Acrack> not to me :D
[21:57:12] <Cork> if you want the span to be focusable use tabindex="0"
[21:57:17] <Cork> Acrack: yes to you
[21:57:24] <Cork> you want the channel log?
[21:57:26] <Cork> :D
[21:57:28] <Acrack> hummm i don't remember then xD
[21:58:24] <Cork> <span class="link" tabindex="0">click me</span> .link { text-decoration: underline; color: blue; cursor: pointer; }
[21:59:56] <Acrack> ok i note this
[22:01:54] <myusuf3> hey
[22:01:56] <myusuf3> quick question
[22:02:07] <myusuf3> if I make an ajax request
[22:02:27] <myusuf3> is it possible to open up a scripting console in google chrome and hit the same endpoint
[22:02:32] <myusuf3> and have it work?/
[22:02:50] <Cork> sure
[22:03:06] <Cork> i use that all the time
[22:03:10] <myusuf3> is that cross domain
[22:03:15] <Cork> no
[22:03:28] <myusuf3> so how do secure a call I want to make
[22:03:28] <Cork> a os console could do it though
[22:03:52] <Cork> browsers inforce crossdomain limitations
[22:04:04] <myusuf3> so how am I able to open and a console
[22:04:07] <myusuf3> and run the script
[22:04:21] <myusuf3> and have the ajax call work
[22:04:24] <Cork> cause it runs in the scope of the site
[22:04:33] <myusuf3> Cork, what I am trying to do is to
[22:04:42] <myusuf3> check username availability
[22:04:50] <myusuf3> so I have a call back on deselect
[22:05:03] <Acrack> span stuff for links is perfect :p other advices Cork ? ^^
[22:05:03] <myusuf3> which make a ajax request to the backend
[22:05:36] <myusuf3> which checks to see if its ajax request
[22:05:45] <Cork> Acrack: a tags with javascript: or href="#" is my born calling to get off the web :)
[22:06:01] <myusuf3> if so return available or not.
[22:06:07] <Cork> Acrack: but no, the rest is just the normal good web practises
[22:06:57] <Cork> myusuf3: you can only secure to make sure its from something originaly loaded from your site
[22:07:04] <Acrack> oki
[22:07:18] <Cork> myusuf3: modern csp can prevent inline scripts i think that works for console too
[22:07:35] <Cork> *scripts, i think
[22:07:57] <myusuf3> Cork, so you just said the console would work for making the request
[22:08:05] <myusuf3> i dont want that to work
[22:08:49] <Cork> myusuf3: the only way that could posibly be done is through csp
[22:09:01] <Cork> and that only works for modern browsers
[22:09:19] <Cork> other then that obscurity is your only way
[22:09:49] <myusuf3> so that isn't a security fault?
[22:10:15] <Cork> security should happen server side
[22:10:26] <Cork> you can NEVER trust client side to security
[22:10:35] <Cork> ever
[22:11:07] <samzhao_> what about js MVC?
[22:11:22] <Cork> its still js
[22:11:29] <Cork> and js can be modified client side
[22:11:39] <samzhao_> even the model part?
[22:12:18] <Whirl3d> I'm a little afraid to ask this, but is it really a bad idea to use a deferred object to handle state? In other words, if I had a "ready" deferred promise, when the element was "ready" it would resolve. That way, if new elements wanted to check the item's "ready" state, it would resolve right away---or they could wait until the deferred was resolved.
[22:13:02] <Whirl3d> "ready" being one possible state, of course
[22:13:11] <snover> well it wouldn’t really be checking the state, it would be saying “I don’t care if this is ready now or later, but when it is ready, run this code”
[22:13:16] <Cork> Whirl3d: deferred only makes sence if your doing something thats async
[22:13:19] <snover> which is of course how you use a deferred
[22:13:27] <Acrack> how to launch the function after a sucess of an ajax ? function : $(document).ready(function() { setInterval(loadChirp, 5000) });
[22:13:43] <Whirl3d> right. like animating state changes can be async
[22:13:49] <Acrack> i don't want to wait 5s, i want it to start as soon as i get success
[22:13:56] <Cork> Whirl3d: its always async
[22:14:25] <Cork> Acrack: call loadChirp()
[22:15:14] <Cork> Whirl3d: but yes, if you otherwise would use a callback deffered is fine
[22:15:27] <Whirl3d> so I am working on a group/state plugin that facilitates functions like $(el).state() --returns the state name of the element... or $(el).state("set","current") would apply the transformations to make it the "current" element int he gorup
[22:15:29] <Cork> *deferred
[22:15:44] <jrockjiggz> does anyone know a way to find out what is causing $.ajaxError to trigger? i console.log each e, xhr, settings, exception but its giving no meaningful data
[22:16:07] <nocturne7> for some reason this is not working, I am not able to set the values of hidden input fields. http://jsfiddle.net/nuSxw/
[22:16:15] <Cork> jrockjiggz: might be response parsing
[22:16:41] <Cork> jrockjiggz: check that what our returning is valid of the format your expecting (ex. json or xml)
[22:17:15] <jrockjiggz> Cork: its failing on $.post() ajaxError is causing page redirect
[22:17:23] <Chibby_> hi, i'm looking at somebody else's code and there code is super complex with lots of js files, just wondering if there's some sort of diagnostic type tool i can use to find out what event is firing when a certain button is clicked?
[22:17:39] <Cork> nocturne7: your running val on #merchantList not the input
[22:17:46] <Chibby_> i've tried to manually search for it based on id and class of the specific element and parent elements, but no dice
[22:17:52] <Chibby_> their*
[22:17:53] <Cork> nocturne7: btw input doens't have an end tag
[22:18:14] <Whirl3d> and I was thinking that $(el).state("current").then(do Something glamorous, do something evil); would be nice. So, the state plugin would violate the jquery tradition and return a deferred that was resolved once the element reached that "state"
[22:18:16] <Cork> nocturne7: store the html string in a jquery variable and set val there and then append it
[22:18:21] <Acrack> Cork call loadChirp() isn't working
[22:18:47] <Cork> Acrack: is loadChrip accessable to the ajax call?
[22:19:12] <samzhao_> is ajax secure at all since it's javascript?
[22:19:19] <Acrack> Cork i think so
[22:19:37] <Cork> samzhao_: its as secure as your page are
[22:19:51] <Cork> Acrack: do you get any errors?
[22:20:12] <Acrack> yes
[22:20:12] <Acrack> sec
[22:20:22] <Cork> samzhao_: but no, you have no garantee that the ajax call was written by you
[22:20:28] <Acrack> missing ; before statementcall loadChirp();test3 (line 405, col 13)
[22:20:57] <Acrack> missing ; before statement call loadChirp();
[22:21:23] <Cork> samzhao_: so you should always construct your page in a way where you can validate this
[22:25:38] <nocturne7> Cork: thanks for the suggestion.
[22:27:35] <forsto> Where do you report a bug of jquery.com? In the http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Past_Releases page, there is a 1.7.1 (Release Notes) link which links to a strange page.
[22:28:32] <Cork> heh wrong date :)
[22:28:48] <Cork> sloppy c&p
[22:28:50] <samzhao_> Cork: are you referring to csrf?
[22:28:52] <Acrack> Cork how to launch a function when the ajax is on success state ?
[22:29:05] <ryankshaw> i have a form with rails style inputs like <input name="thing[sub_attribute][sub_sub_attribute]" value=1> I want a javascript object that looks like: {thing: {sub_attribute: {sub_sub_attribute: 1}}} . what am I looking for?
[22:29:11] <Cork> samzhao_: no https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP/CSP_policy_directives
[22:29:46] <Cork> ryankshaw: regex
[22:30:02] <Cork> and a loop
[22:30:31] <Cork> ryankshaw: or if its for an ajax call, you could just use the name as it is
[22:30:32] <ryankshaw> there has to be some thing in jquery core / a common plugin that does that already though, I don't want to reinvent the wheel.
[22:30:44] <Cork> ryankshaw: there isn't
[22:30:58] <Cork> normally you don't need to split that up
[22:31:00] <ryankshaw> it is an ajax call but I need to massage it a little before sending the $.ajax request

[22:31:39] <Cork> ryankshaw: splitting the name field isn't anything jquery provides
[22:32:07] <Cork> (and honnestly i donno why you would need it)
[22:33:13] <Cork> forlong: btw its a wiki, have you tried creating an accound and fix it?
[22:33:34] <ryankshaw> well looks like it's time to start writing that loop, thanks for the help Cork
[22:33:55] <Cork> ryankshaw: could you answer the question why you would need it?
[22:42:39] <Acrack> anyone here ?
[22:42:46] <samzhao_> hi
[22:43:05] <Acrack> how to load a function after a sucess of an ajax ? :(
[22:43:25] <samzhao_> are you talking about the advanced method or the noob one...
[22:43:45] <Acrack> lemme show u (i think it is the noob one)
[22:43:46] <coldhead> cheer up Acrack, we're gonna get you through this!
[22:44:04] <samzhao_> coldhead: ya, I can try
[22:44:29] <Acrack> http://pastie.org/3808747
[22:44:37] <forsto> Cork: were you talking to me?
[22:45:04] <samzhao_> Acrack: what do you want to achieve?
[22:45:08] <Acrack> i want to call : function loadChirp(){
[22:45:23] <Acrack> loadChirp update a part of my page
[22:45:47] <samzhao_> how do i modify ur code?
[22:45:57] <Acrack> oh sec
[22:46:08] <samzhao_> maybe paste it on jsfiddle or something
[22:46:29] <coldhead> Acrack: http://pastie.org/3808752
[22:46:54] <Cork> forsto: sorry, yes
[22:46:54] <coldhead> just replace my_stupid_bollocks() with loadChirp()
[22:46:57] <coldhead> and case closed
[22:47:10] <drastik> Is there a way to catch & trigger when something becomes animated?  Not something that is already animating like ':animate'
[22:47:26] <poppiez> why doesn't jquery use requestAnimationFrame for animations?
[22:47:38] <coldhead> not universally supported, poppiez
[22:47:57] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/8vWFD/18/
[22:48:08] <poppiez> coldhead: no, but why not provide a better experience for the browsers that support it?
[22:48:39] <coldhead> poppiez: i'm sure they will eventually, i believe there are plugins that let you use it in the meantime
[22:48:46] <samzhao_> Acrack: is this what you mean? http://pastie.org/3808762
[22:48:51] <coldhead> poppiez: do of course feel free to submit a pull request :)
[22:49:21] <Acrack> samzhao_: i think this is it
[22:49:22] <poppiez> coldhead: remember the plugin?
[22:49:24] <Acrack> lemme try
[22:49:47] <coldhead> sorry poppiez, i think someone was telling me about it IRL, i haven't seen it
[22:50:12] <samzhao_> coldhead's solution works as well, I'm just too noob to use it..
[22:50:25] <coldhead> your solution is neater, samzhao_
[22:50:47] <samzhao_> coldhead: thanks, I ripped it off of a js plugin sample
[22:51:41] <coldhead> poppiez: https://github.com/kohashi/jQuery-Keyframes-animation ?
[22:51:44] <coldhead> that seems old
[22:51:48] <coldhead> but there are probably others
[22:52:01] <Acrack> samzhao_: thanks this is exactly this :)
[22:52:29] <samzhao_> Acrack: np :D
[22:52:37] <poppiez> coldhead: thx, I'll keep googling :)
[22:52:51] <coldhead> great work everyone, take five
[22:53:08] <forsto> Cork: strange, I opened http://docs.jquery.com/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&returnto=Special:Userlogin and found no place to create an account. I'm confused. :-/
[22:53:11] <samzhao_> coldhead: hooray
[22:53:18] <smplstk> poppiez: there's a requestAnimationFrame shim, if you care that much. there's also a plugin that'll turn animate() into css3 if it can.
[22:53:45] <smplstk> poppiez: http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[22:54:04] <coldhead> that's what i was after, thanks smplstk
[22:54:10] <Whirl3d> I like transit.js
[22:54:24] <coldhead> transit is also well regarded
[22:54:43] <Cork> forsto: then i donno
[22:54:57] <forsto> Cork: thanks anyway. :)
[22:55:00] <Cork> ... wfm it has a test account >_<
[22:55:05] <ajpiano> forsto: i just fixed it for you
[22:55:12] <samzhao_> i love all those js plugins or libraries or w/e, but hate its security issues
[22:55:13] <ajpiano> thanks for reporting
[22:55:17] <ajpiano> the blog permalink obv change
[22:55:21] <ajpiano> changed*
[22:55:34] <forsto> ajpiano: np. and thanks also.
[22:55:42] <Cork> ajpiano: looks more like it was a copy of the 1.7 link
[22:55:47] <ajpiano> ah
[22:56:48] <smplstk> damn, https://github.com/rstacruz/jquery.transit does look good...
[22:58:25] <samzhao_> @smplstk: doesn't work on IE
[22:59:03] <coldhead> that's like saying you don't like dubstep because your grandmother is dead
[22:59:23] <smplstk> ?hi5 @ coldhead
[22:59:23] <bot-t> coldhead, ⋰⁵⋱
[22:59:59] <samzhao_> coldhead: what are u talking about
[23:00:19] <coldhead> i've no idea, really
[23:00:28] <coldhead> i was just trying to be a cool guy
[23:01:07] <Cork> smplstk: not sure why you would need it in js though (i love the fact that there "demo" doesn't use the plugin :D)
[23:01:08] <coldhead> sup rocky
[23:01:18] <coldhead> their*
[23:02:59] <Whirl3d> huh? http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
[23:03:21] <Cork> Whirl3d: check the source, its all in style.css :D
[23:03:36] <Whirl3d> that's the point.
[23:03:41] <samzhao_> Cork: does the plugin do anything though?
[23:03:44] <Whirl3d> it uses css if available
[23:04:01] <samzhao_> I thought the plugin is there as a fallback
[23:04:13] <Cork> Whirl3d: i mean they never call it
[23:04:23] <Cork> Whirl3d: its hardcoded css
[23:04:37] <Cork> samzhao_: it does, but the demo doesn't use it
[23:05:16] <Whirl3d> If i select pause script execution. it pauses all the animations
[23:06:21] <samzhao_> "BROWSER SUPPORT: IE 10+.."
[23:06:30] <Cork> :)
[23:06:42] <samzhao_> isn't that just css3 alone?
[23:07:00] * smplstk nods
[23:07:23] <samzhao_> oh i see what the plugin does now! it's basically a simpler way to do css3 transitions and animations with jquery..
[23:07:38] <Cork> yup
[23:07:47] <coldhead> GREAT JOB EVERYONE TAKE FIVE
[23:07:52] <coldhead> DON'T MAKE ME SAY IT AGAIN
[23:07:59] <tw2113> take six?
[23:08:06] <samzhao_> coldhead: say it again
[23:08:10] <coldhead> GREAT JOB EVERYONE TAKE FIVE
[23:08:23] <samzhao_> coldhead: thx
[23:08:29] <coldhead> now take five
[23:08:32] <Cork> holly...*#?*?*!!
[23:08:42] <Cork> there is code to actually do it
[23:08:49] <Cork> but... it parses the text on the page >_<
[23:08:55] <samzhao_> there's code to take five?
[23:08:56] <Cork> code = code.replace(/\$\(['"](.*?)['"]\)/g, '$("#'+id+' $1:not(.ghost)")');
[23:09:06] * Cork shivers...
[23:09:43] <samzhao_> why do people hate "live()"?
[23:10:01] <Cork> samzhao_: cause its miss leading and a bit waistfull
[23:10:07] <systemfault> We do?
[23:10:17] <systemfault> It's just deprecated...
[23:10:38] <samzhao_> i think it points to the "on" function in the source code
[23:10:46] <Cork> it does
[23:11:03] <Cork> every thing event based points to on and off now days
[23:11:26] <samzhao_> but "live" is the only thing that seems to work for me
[23:11:41] <samzhao_> among delegate and bind that is
[23:11:57] <Cork> samzhao_: $(document).on('event_name', 'selector', function() {}) === .live()
[23:12:01] <systemfault> sabotage: $(document.body).on('click', selectorHere, function() {}) should be pretty much the same..
[23:12:10] <systemfault> Like Cork said :P
[23:12:30] <smplstk> coldhead: >:|
[23:12:43] <Cork> XD
[23:12:44] <smplstk> amazing
[23:12:56] <samzhao_> oh, i don't know, maybe it's my fault
[23:13:05] <samzhao_> me being a noob
[23:13:25] <Cork> samzhao_: the syntax is a bit difference, but it generates the exact same effect
[23:13:42] <Cork> *different
[23:13:45] <samzhao_> Cork: cool
[23:14:14] <samzhao_> I'm the kind of guy who sits in front of the computer and simply try out stuff without thinking much
[23:14:30] <samzhao_> so things sometimes don't work for me :P
[23:14:58] <samzhao_> I like to try before learn
[23:15:03] <Dr-Bombay> I try to think but nothing happens
[23:15:39] <samzhao_> Dr-Bombay: that's why you need to get your hands dirty
[23:15:54] <samzhao_> i think thinking and trying should be balanced
[23:16:04] <Dr-Bombay> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxtW98VSegk
[23:16:36] <Christer> wtf, pictures in irc ? :O
[23:16:44] <samzhao_> Dr-Bombay: ahahah, i used to watch that when i was little
[23:16:52] <Christer> i can see its been a while since i last checked this out! haha
[23:16:57] <dgx> Hey all. How can I make this: when I click a link I want to open some kind of gallery plugin? Like nivo slider or fancybox. However I don't want to display the images on the page.
[23:17:26] <samzhao_> dgx: then why triggering it anyways?
[23:17:31] <Whirl3d> kind of like peeing yourself in a dark suite
[23:17:35] <Whirl3d> suit*
[23:19:32] <samzhao_> Whirl3d: not smart enough to get your metaphor
[23:19:45] <dgx> samzhao_: Projects specifications, can't change them :)
[23:19:48] <Whirl3d> nobody notices if you open a picture gallery with no pictures
[23:20:02] <Whirl3d> just like if you wet your pants and they are dark enough, no one notices
[23:20:14] <Whirl3d> but still gives you a warm feeling all over
[23:20:16] <samzhao_> Whirl3d: oh lol..
[23:20:17] <smplstk> ?get @ smplstk
[23:20:17] <caniuse> smplstk: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[23:20:19] <dgx> The buttons says "gallery" and when you click it it opens the gallery.
[23:20:47] <samzhao_> dgx: so maybe you can link it to the gallery page?
[23:21:08] <samzhao_> dgx: or just do the drill with the plugins and put nothing inside of the content divs
[23:21:12] <dgx> It must open it the same window, like lightbox for example.
[23:21:53] <dgx> I am thinking on doing display:none/overflow:hidden on the images in the same div, would that work?
[23:22:12] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/ Can anyone tell me why me menu does not fade in/out. If you hover the big pink button it shows and hides a menu, however it has some query that should make it fade.. and it doesn't. Google Chrome/Firebug JS consoles don't show any faults?
[23:22:17] <samzhao_> dgx: i think display none works
[23:25:26] <Whirl3d> is it my imagination, fRAiLtY-, or are you using every js framework in the book?
[23:25:53] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: I'm working with Magento that uses prototype, I'm using jQuery alongside it in noConflict.
[23:26:09] <Whirl3d> Magento, got it.
[23:26:17] <Cork> Whirl3d: no i know of at least a few more ;P
[23:26:22] <fRAiLtY-> aka devilspawn
[23:26:48] <Whirl3d> Well, Cork, I think we all know that your book is bigger than most...
[23:26:52] <fRAiLtY-> And I use the term "working with" loosely, it's more a case of fighting against.
[23:26:54] <dgx> samzhao_: Yea, that was does it. I just left the first <a> with text only, and display:none to the other <a> & <img> elements
[23:27:24] <samzhao_> dgx: glad it works for u
[23:27:26] <fRAiLtY-> Anyhow, can anyone tell me why it doesn't fade in/out? Kept playing with it yesterday but no luck :x
[23:27:39] <fRAiLtY-> Cant get Firebug or Chrome JS console to show an error :x
[23:27:40] <Cork> Whirl3d: well i would say yui and extjs should be big enough that most should know about them >_>
[23:28:00] <Whirl3d> wat?
[23:28:18] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, where abouts in your script would the hover handler be?
[23:28:37] <Cork> Whirl3d: line 133
[23:29:03] <samzhao_> fRAiLtY-: why do i get "null" when I tried to get .buttonMenu
[23:29:31] <fRAiLtY-> Code: http://pastie.org/3808888
[23:29:36] <samzhao_> that might be the problem i think?
[23:29:44] <fRAiLtY-> samzhao_: How are you seeing that?
[23:30:11] <samzhao_> fRAiLtY-: in the console of chrome
[23:30:45] <fRAiLtY-> wtf is wrong with my browser :x
[23:30:50] <Cork> samzhao_: you used $ or jQuery ?
[23:30:52] <fRAiLtY-> Shows no errors at all
[23:31:09] <Cork> add a dom ready around your code
[23:31:15] <samzhao_> Cork: oops, i used $ :p
[23:31:54] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: your binding without waiting for dom ready
[23:32:01] <samzhao_> ok here's what I typed in chrome's console: jQuery('.buttonMenu').hover(function(){jQuery('.showMenu').fadeToggle();}); and it works
[23:33:03] <Whirl3d> does your "hover" class contain opacity and display attributes? Adding the hover class on hover may set your properties making fadeIn and fadeOut useless?
[23:33:32] <samzhao_> I think Cork is right. fRAiLtY- can't get anything before the dom's ready
[23:34:17] <Cork> he can, but the script is before the showMenu element
[23:34:29] <Cork> so it defenitly won't exist then the code runs
[23:34:43] <samzhao_> and the reason I can get it working in chrome's console is because the showMenu is ready
[23:34:57] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: You're correct I've added jQuery(document).ready(function(){ blah }); and it works…. however, try it now… look what happens to the page lol
[23:35:36] <fRAiLtY-> Fades though…. lol
[23:35:49] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: something happpens?
[23:35:51] <samzhao_> elements get messed up
[23:36:02] <Cork> not for me
[23:36:15] <fRAiLtY-> The whole page gets messed up? When not hovered.. elements are moved about
[23:36:42] <samzhao_> from what i'm seeing, the pink button is moved down when mouseout
[23:36:48] <fRAiLtY-> samzhao_: correct.
[23:36:56] <fRAiLtY-> why though, is fine without the jQuery
[23:36:57] <Cork> its when you move to the top of the button
[23:37:02] <samzhao_> fRAiLtY-: sorry i was not saying that the whole page is messed up, just some elements around that button
[23:37:11] <fRAiLtY-> samzhao_: No you're right
[23:37:43] <fRAiLtY-> Why is that?
[23:37:54] <Cork> looks like a webkit bug
[23:38:36] <fRAiLtY-> Really?
[23:39:04] <Whirl3d> it's not because you have the pseudo style:hover   set position:absolute?
[23:39:13] <samzhao_> Cork: hate to hear that because i love webkit
[23:39:50] <Cork> hmm no its not
[23:39:56] <fRAiLtY-> Doesn't do it in Firefox though...
[23:39:57] <Cork> opera and ie shows the same sumtom
[23:39:59] <samzhao_> Cork: Yay!
[23:40:02] <Cork> symtom
[23:40:20] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: could Whirl3d be right, it's a CSS thing?
[23:40:28] <Cork> samzhao_: though that said, yes webkit cuts corners and is buggier then the other engins
[23:40:45] <Whirl3d> if you disable the :hover  attribute. it affects it.
[23:41:04] <Cork> the different browsers show symtoms that are a bit different
[23:41:32] <samzhao_> Cork: i just think it's much faster than firefox (on my machine) and it's compatible with most css3 and html5 stuff
[23:42:11] <systemfault> Firefox improved a lot...
[23:42:15] <samzhao_> ok by webkit, I usually refer to chrome because im on windows
[23:42:31] <systemfault> I feel the opposite with chrome, it seems to be buggier these days,
[23:42:38] <Whirl3d> just add position absoulte to the hovermenu showmenu class
[23:42:39] <systemfault> (I still use chrome though)
[23:42:42] <Whirl3d> it fixes it
[23:42:44] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: What do you think is my problem?
[23:43:10] <samzhao_> fRAiLtY-: try Whirl3d's suggestions
[23:43:24] <fRAiLtY-> samzhao_: It adjusts the styling of the menu but doesn't stop the issue
[23:43:33] <samzhao_> systemfault: my laptop is slow and outdated, it runs chrome faster than firefox
[23:43:48] <systemfault> Ah ok
[23:43:48] <Whirl3d> What do you mean. It looks perfect for me on Chrome?
[23:43:52] <fRAiLtY-> If I hover the mouse over where the div "would be" if it where visible all is well, it's when I hover outside of that
[23:44:28] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i think its your <div class="clear"> thats causing it
[23:44:39] <samzhao_> systemfault: my laptop is HP..and everything seems to be falling apart right after the warrenty ended
[23:45:13] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Just commented that out, makes no difference.
[23:45:19] <fRAiLtY-> It's fine until you mouseout
[23:45:23] <fRAiLtY-> Loads ok initially I mean
[23:45:55] <systemfault> samzhao_: I had a similar issue with a Dell laptop I bought a few years ago :/
[23:46:25] <Whirl3d> do you need to define .hovermenu .showMenu width and height to include the popup menu (so the hover event doesnt mouse out)?
[23:46:38] <samzhao_> systemfault: i took my laptop to a repair shop and the guy was like "oh it's hp, no wonder"...
[23:46:46] <systemfault> haha
[23:47:03] <samzhao_> i used to like hp...
[23:47:23] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: It's dynamic, so will change as categories are added etc
[23:47:29] <fRAiLtY-> hence why I haven't defined a height
[23:47:50] <fRAiLtY-> It has a width though.
[23:47:56] <samzhao_> but i think firefox is getting much more optimized now, I'm jsut used to using chrome, feels more simplistic and lightweight
[23:49:19] <Whirl3d> interesting. If you assing display:iinline block to the hovermenu, it lines up different, but still messes up on mouseout
[23:49:31] <systemfault> I'd be using firefox nowadays if it wasn't of the chrome dev tools
[23:49:46] * tw2113 uses firefox in spite of whatever chrome offers
[23:50:05] <coldhead> have you good people all heard this a lot? http://jonneal.bandcamp.com/album/yayquery
[23:50:10] <samzhao_> tw2113: lol
[23:50:32] <samzhao_> systemfault: i love chrome's dev tools too
[23:50:43] <samzhao_> coldhead: another js podcast?
[23:50:57] <systemfault> coldhead: Hmm.. wtf?
[23:51:05] <systemfault> samzhao_: They're songs...
[23:51:18] <Whirl3d> you are assinging the hover event to the button menu element. Which is small.
[23:51:21] <samzhao_> systemfault: oh...nothing to do here
[23:51:46] <samzhao_> haha I like how Whirl3d spells assign
[23:51:48] <tw2113> oh Jonathan Neal
[23:52:12] <drastik> So I'm trying to do something after the animation event of a function in a different JS file.  Selector :animated isn't good because it's not always animating, and I tried the .when() & .done() stuff on the animation function but I get unknown or not defined
[23:52:17] <samzhao_> Whirl3d: no offense
[23:52:19] <Whirl3d> perhaps you could bind the mouseenter handler to the buttonmenu element and then trigger a mouseleave function to hide the hover menu..
[23:52:20] <drastik> Anyone done something like this before?
[23:53:45] <Whirl3d> like $(".buttonMenu").on("mouseenter", function (e) { $(".showMenu").fadeIn().on("mouseleave.hover", function ( e) {$(this).off("mouseleave.hover").fadeOut();})
[23:54:15] <Whirl3d> but do it correctly. I didn't match ()() or anything cause my kb is falling apart
[23:54:33] <Cork> drastik: you could generate a custom even on the element when your animation is complete and listen for that
[23:54:43] <Cork> *event
[23:55:28] <drastik> hmm interesting
[23:55:58] <poppiez> can this be reduced to less reflows: http://pastie.org/private/ldvsbzpia0fnnrpyqdjxig?
[23:56:04] <fRAiLtY-> I just spoke to a guy in css who says I need to make sure you remove the box from the page flow with position absolute, even when it’s not shown (hidden with opacity)..how can I do this?
[23:56:22] <Cork> drastik: $().animate({}, function() { $(this).trigger('animationcomplete'); }); $().on('animationcomplete', function() {});
[23:56:45] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, did you try changing your hover event handler like I said. It'd take you 3 minutes and it would be worth a try.
[23:56:54] <drastik> Cork: oh well that would be fantastic, but the animation is coming from the jCarousel library on something & I can't tack that on
[23:57:14] <Cork> drastik: it doesn't give you a callback?
[23:57:23] <drastik> Cork: when u click the <  or  >    on a jcarousel to slide to next round of images, it animates the ul  left/right  & I want to act on that event
[23:57:37] <drastik> BUT, if I do it on the button click it's too soon :X
[23:57:41] <drastik> has to be after it moves lol
[23:57:45] <Whirl3d> you could override the animate function to return a deferred and handle the callback that way
[23:57:48] <Cork> drastik: it doesn't give you a callback? <--
[23:57:54] <drastik> Cork: no
[23:58:13] <Cork> then your screwd
[23:58:24] <drastik> lol
[23:58:32] <drastik> has callbacks for like after it's loaded & stuff
[23:58:41] <Cork> extending jCarusel or monky-patching is only way to solve it
[23:59:06] <drastik> omgash  there is another callback down there for this, maybe it will work,  thanks!
[23:59:47] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: I tried commenting out the :hover part in the CSS and it didn't work, what bit are you referring too?
