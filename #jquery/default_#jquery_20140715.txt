[01:38:00] <K-202> jQuery error in IE 11 (IE 8 compat mode) http://i3.minus.com/ibzNg2UArwMCzT.png "Object does not support this property or method" how to fix?
[01:41:18] <Cork> K-202: follow the error out to your code
[01:41:28] <K-202> $(xmlElement).data("tempTable", jQueryObjectOnXmlElement);
[01:43:45] <Cork> K-202: might be cause your working with an xml document
[01:46:12] <Cork> K-202: try to identify if it is
[01:46:16] <Cork> elem[ internalKey ]
[01:46:20] <crooksey> I am using getJSON to get a json string, and display it on my page, this works fine, can anyone help me loop through each result and format it and display in my table (shown in paste) I have tried adapting several tutorials I came across, but can't seem to get it to work, here is the example with the raw JSON data, http://paste.ofcode.org/pZYyCj5AFZRYXeS3UTP8bv
[01:46:23] <Cork> deletedIds.pop()
[01:46:28] <Cork> or jQuery.guid++
[01:46:33] <Cork> that crashes for you
[01:46:55] <K-202> Cork: i have already done it - probably elem[internalKey] breaks it
[01:47:14] <crooksey> I did try: http://paste.ofcode.org/3autksbxGArj2G5tCYbtBVC but that didn't work
[01:47:25] <Cork> K-202: so ie8 compatible mode doesn't let you add the expando key to the inode...
[01:47:39] <Cork> not much jquery can do then; you can't use .data()
[01:47:46] <juslintek> Which event captures that popover is visible?
[01:48:12] <juslintek> for example now i'm doing like that:  $(document).on("show popover", function(){..............
[01:48:20] <juslintek> And it doesn't work
[01:48:34] <juslintek> I'm using bootstrap 3
[01:49:14] <Cork> crooksey: $.each(data, function() { $.each(this, function(key, value) {  }); });
[01:49:33] <Cork> crooksey: or if you always have the same named keys you could use them from the this element
[01:50:11] <Cork> crooksey: also please use jsfiddle or jsbin those makes it much easier to help fix up the code
[01:52:45] <Cork> juslintek: you would prob have to ask the bootstrap team (and not in jquery)
[01:53:03] <Cork> but looking at there documentation it doesn't look like it is means to be used as events
[01:53:19] <Cork> but ya, wouldn't know
[01:54:09] <juslintek> do you know their channel?
[01:54:50] <juslintek> found it thanx:

[01:58:24] <nicolas_FR> hi there
[02:01:52] <nicolas_FR> I would like to validate or mark as error a field depending on the value of another one. little jsfiddle here with explanations : http://jsfiddle.net/X8LpR/ - "Depends" seems not (to me) to be the answer...
[02:06:23] <svetlana> http://jsfiddle.net/wSL4k/2/ please how do I get the values of the input field and the textarea? It's not giving me any hints.
[02:07:11] <Cork> svetlana: textarea#feedback-message <-- never prefix ids
[02:07:17] <Cork> just do #feedback-message
[02:07:32] <Cork> svetlana: http://jsfiddle.net/wSL4k/3/
[02:08:09] <Cork> svetlana: also don't forget to use a form
[02:08:27] <Cork> and based on how the page looks, you want to use the submit event on the form instead of click on the button
[02:09:29] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/wSL4k/6/
[02:09:42] <svetlana> thanks. (it is not a real form, though, the button is supposed to make an ajax query)
[02:09:44] <Cork> opps for got the event
[02:09:56] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/wSL4k/7/
[02:10:03] <Cork> svetlana: you should still use a form
[02:14:27] <svetlana> I've opened a page and typed something in an input box whose id is '#feedback-subject'; but in firefox's web console $('#feedback-subject').val() returns undefined
[02:14:32] <nicolas_FR> Anyone got an idea with this little jsfiddle (explanations inside): http://jsfiddle.net/X8LpR/ - "Depends" seems not (to me) to be the answer...
[02:15:16] <Cork> svetlana: most likely you have multiple elements with the same id
[02:15:37] <Cork> nicolas_FR: please ask the question in the channel
[02:15:49] <Cork> else ppl can't at a glimse tell if they can answer
[02:15:50] <nicolas_FR> I would like to validate or mark as error a field depending on the value of another one. little jsfiddle here with explanations : http://jsfiddle.net/X8LpR/ - "Depends" seems not (to me) to be the answer...
[02:15:51] <svetlana> $('#feedback-subject') is quite well defined though as it returns the html object thing into the console
[02:16:19] <Cork> svetlana: if .val() returns undefined
[02:16:40] <Cork> it means the element you are grabbing isn't an input, select or textarea element
[02:16:45] <nicolas_FR> I have 3 radio buttons with the same name, and if 1 particular is checked, then another field must be validated (and marked as error if empty)
[02:17:11] <svetlana> sorry, I got it, I had a typo in the id :)
[02:19:56] <nicolas_FR> hmmm http://jsfiddle.net/X8LpR/1/ seems to be my solution in fact. Hourray to "depends" on both fields
[02:47:07] <donni> any suggestion for page scrolling?
[02:55:50] <nicolas_FR> I want to add an "onclick" event listener for my validation rules, but only for 1 field. Should I test the "element" passed to the "onchange" listener to match the one I want or another way is possible ?
[03:32:57] <Naeblis> Hello, I'm new-ish to jQuery. I have the following code that shows/hides certain elements based on which button you click. I can't help but feel it's clunky. Is there any way this can be improved? http://bpaste.net/show/MKQ9l8pH36aqqjjqlP64/
[03:39:03] <HowardwLo> im having some trouble grabbing meta tags from the <head> after ajax
[03:39:59] <HowardwLo> console.log(elms.find('meta[property="og:title"]'));   comes out as preObject: context: undefined
[03:40:04] <HowardwLo> prev*
[03:41:08] <HowardwLo> var elms = $(data), where data is the response from ajax :D
[03:43:15] <decx> don't use find, use filter
[03:44:12] <HowardwLo> oh, holy crap that works
[03:44:13] <HowardwLo> thanks!
[03:45:06] <decx> you see find looks inwards an element but meta, title and everything inside the root of body is in a flat structure so you have to filter it out instead
[03:48:35] <CaffeinatedSky> Can someone explain to me why PHP isn't receiving the textarea array? jQuery is dynamically creating textarea's but PHP doesn't receive it in POST. http://jsbin.com/vukuxuma/1/edit
[03:49:07] <CaffeinatedSky> Do I have to POST with jQuery or something?
[03:53:02] <HowardwLo> decx: i see
[03:54:03] <HowardwLo> decx: is there a way to grab a list for og:image meta tags? since there can be multiple og:image tags, i think im going to clear my current dom of those tags, then grab all of the meta og:image tags from the ajax response and shove them in
[03:55:03] <decx> filter will return all of them
[03:55:54] <systemfault> HowardwLo: Why do you want to do that?
[03:56:19] <HowardwLo> systemfault: well the old meta tags wont be accurate
[03:56:49] <decx> i dont even want to know
[03:56:49] <systemfault> HowardwLo: It doesn’t matter because services like facebook only parse the those tags when the page is first loaded
[03:56:58] <systemfault> -the
[03:57:13] <HowardwLo> systemfault: wait what?
[03:57:41] <HowardwLo> so if i ajax new content in, facebook wont work? ...
[03:58:11] <decx> facebook doesnt want or need to use the resources to not only GET html but also execute it
[03:58:58] <HowardwLo> i dont understand
[03:58:59] <systemfault> HowardwLo: The facebook bot doesn’t care about JS (AFAIK). It reads the initial HTML at the url shared and uses those tags
[03:59:12] <HowardwLo> im using history api to swap out my url?
[03:59:31] <systemfault> HowardwLo: You only need to care about meta tags for the initial load.
[03:59:36] <HowardwLo> its also for rich pins
[03:59:42] <systemfault> What’s important is the URL
[04:00:48] <HowardwLo> what if a service like pinterest uses og tags to create rich pins?
[04:00:59] <HowardwLo> maybe im misunderstanding what these meta tags are for..
[04:01:45] <systemfault> You just need to know what those tags are parsed when the HTML document is first parsed, after that… they don’t mean anything.
[04:02:01] <CaffeinatedSky> Does anyone have any ideas as to why a dynamically created textarea woulden't be posted?
[04:02:04] <HowardwLo> it doesnt affect the facebook liek button?
[04:02:06] <HowardwLo> like*
[04:02:29] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, is it in the form?
[04:02:44] <CaffeinatedSky> It is. The weird thing is I can't find </form> in the DOM
[04:03:02] <CaffeinatedSky> It is definetly is in the HTML though.
[04:03:15] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, well that might affect it
[04:03:30] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, does it have a name? what about an id?
[04:03:37] <CaffeinatedSky> http://jsbin.com/vukuxuma/1/edit
[04:04:16] <systemfault> HowardwLo: Try it to be sure but AFAIK, the only thing that matters to facebook is the URL. So facebook is going to fetch the tags at the provided url and use them. It doesn’t get the “current meta tags” that are in the dom.
[04:04:30] <CaffeinatedSky> For example, introduction and conclusion as well as action are in the POST but not question[]
[04:05:09] <CaffeinatedSky> It's REALLY weird..
[04:08:04] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, by the way how do you do a stream on jsbin?
[04:08:08] <Omar-> who needs help in jQuery-Mobile?
[04:08:34] <CaffeinatedSky> No idea :P, it just did it automatically
[04:11:26] <CaffeinatedSky> Woah woah. Now Firefox is saying 'Stray End </form'
[04:11:33] <CaffeinatedSky> What in the actual...
[04:13:17] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, it doesnt add the text areas for me
[04:14:07] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, AH there was no jquery
[04:15:11] <CaffeinatedSky> Oh my bad :P
[04:18:14] <CaffeinatedSky> It really makes no sense that firefox would say that though. There is no </form> anywhere else..
[04:20:40] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, works for me now
[04:21:29] <CaffeinatedSky> The problem isn't the creation of the textarea's. It's the PHP doesn't have the question[] in the POST
[04:21:46] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, was able to add 2 additional ones fill out all 4 post it get the forbiden error but went ahead and looked at the post data and there were 4 questions
[04:23:54] <CaffeinatedSky> How did you see the post data?
[04:24:32] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, go to the hit f12 to open developer tools then go to the network tab
[04:26:34] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, have you tried different browsers?
[04:26:42] <djQuery_> i am doing this in chrome
[04:26:51] <djQuery_> http://jsbin.com/vukuxuma/2/edit
[04:29:23] <CaffeinatedSky> It's so weird because on my site it doesn't post that.
[04:30:12] <CaffeinatedSky> All it has is the introductions, the conclusion, and the action..
[04:31:02] <CaffeinatedSky> It's like the form is being ended early, but I don't see any other </form>'s
[04:31:23] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, well from looking at what the browser is posting it looks like a php issue
[04:31:44] <djQuery_> try copying my js where I got rid of your /
[04:32:08] <djQuery_> that and adding jquery to it were the only changes i made http://jsbin.com/vukuxuma/2/edit
[04:34:29] <djQuery_> i like jsbin interface better but I like jsfiddle colaboration better
[04:35:47] <CaffeinatedSky> djQuery_, Nope. The post shown in Chrome and in Firefox on my website is showing only conclusion, introduction, and action.
[04:36:01] <CaffeinatedSky> I tried your edit, and it didn't bring up the new ones.
[04:36:24] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, hmmmm link to your site since its working in jsbin?
[04:36:33] <djQuery_> there has to be some difference
[04:36:35] <CaffeinatedSky> I don't right now, let me git push it.
[04:43:50] <obert> hg!
[04:46:53] <CaffeinatedSky> djQuery_, sorry having a little trouble with git -.-
[04:47:03] <obert> hg!
[04:47:16] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, sokay working on my cs50 stuff
[04:51:57] <CaffeinatedSky> Noticed you it, djQuery_.
[04:59:32] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, dont see a form element anywhere on there
[05:01:07] <CaffeinatedSky> djQuery_, It starts on line 97 and ends on 139.
[05:01:11] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, I found the form
[05:01:27] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, but when I add the fields they are being added to the form
[05:01:34] <djQuery_> hence not in the post
[05:01:58] <CaffeinatedSky> Can you elaborate? I'm not sure I totally understand..
[05:02:40] <CaffeinatedSky> Aren't the fields supposed to be in the form O.o?
[05:03:34] <djQuery_> the div that you are adding them too is not inside the form so ofcourse the form is not going to post them
[05:04:14] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, what line did you say that the form ends on?
[05:04:19] <CaffeinatedSky> 139
[05:04:29] <djQuery_> what line does the questions div start on?
[05:04:41] <CaffeinatedSky> #questions starts on 122.
[05:05:18] <CaffeinatedSky> Does jQuery auto-close tags by chance?
[05:06:19] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, thats not what I am seeing in the source when I highlight the form tag in the source questions is not in the highlighted
[05:06:36] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, this is even before clicking on any of the buttons
[05:07:41] <CaffeinatedSky> Woah, I see what you mean now..
[05:08:00] <CaffeinatedSky> I wonder what is messing the DOM up so badly?
[05:09:10] <CaffeinatedSky> If you look at the actual view source rather than the DOM, you can see the </form> is for sure after #questions.
[05:09:31] <CaffeinatedSky> But When you look at it in inspect mode, it's closed before that..
[05:10:01] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, looks like you have a php problem somewhere
[05:10:24] <djQuery_> sure could right javascript to move the stuff around but better to fix it at the source
[05:11:08] <CaffeinatedSky> Er, I guess I don't understand how PHP could be causing this
[05:17:57] <CaffeinatedSky> Yeah..it's not a PHP error. The form is autoclosing itself. I relocated the #questions to a higher div and it included it in the form.
[05:18:35] <CaffeinatedSky> There's something wrong with it on a HTML level or something
[05:20:02] <DeliriumTremens> so onbeforeunload and on('beforeunload') don't work in chrome... is there a similar method I can use for executing a function at the last possible second?
[05:22:58] <CaffeinatedSky> djQuery_, I found the problem -.-
[05:23:43] <CaffeinatedSky> Evidently, and I will never forget this, a form cannot go past the ending of the div that it is located in.
[05:27:25] <Cork> CaffeinatedSky: no element can go past the element they are in
[05:27:32] <Cork> CaffeinatedSky: only invalid html can do that
[05:27:51] <CaffeinatedSky> Today I learned, after a few hours.
[05:28:18] <Cork> CaffeinatedSky: tip always use w3c validator if you're not really sure the site is valid
[05:28:22] <Cork> ?g w3c validator
[05:28:23] <b-ot> Cork: The W3C Markup Validation Service → http://validator.w3.org/
[05:28:43] <CaffeinatedSky> Thanks
[05:28:44] <Cork> cause debugging problems on invalid html is bound to be confusing
[05:29:25] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, what editor are you using that didn't throw a flag up at this?
[05:29:37] <CaffeinatedSky> Sublime
[05:30:07] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, do you have any linters installed?
[05:30:16] <CaffeinatedSky> Nope, no idea what linter is.
[05:30:24] <djQuery_> lol
[05:30:44] <Cork> CaffeinatedSky: https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-for-ST2
[05:30:45] <djQuery_> http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
[05:31:03] <CaffeinatedSky> Hmm, I'll have to check if they have one for v3
[05:31:21] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, the one I linked is for v3
[05:32:02] <CaffeinatedSky> "For ST2" Must have not wanted to change their git name O.o
[05:32:30] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, BUT sublimelinter is an error checker that does not itself check errors
[05:32:46] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, you actualy have to get a plugin for it in addition
[05:32:57] <CaffeinatedSky> Ah, understood.
[05:33:20] <djQuery_> CaffeinatedSky, https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-php
[05:35:47] <CaffeinatedSky> Installed both. Thanks. Time to read docs :P
[06:01:12] <krambiorix> hi, $(this).closest('tr').prev()  doesn't select hidden rows... How can i make it do that?
[06:02:23] <decx> doesnt matter if it's hidden you're doing something else wrong
[06:05:27] <Cork> krambiorix: hidden prev and closest works with dom elements not css values
[06:05:34] <Cork> so hidden or not doesn't effect it at all
[06:07:07] <krambiorix> Cork, decx , yeah i cloned it and added it again but i had to show() it again :D
[06:07:14] <krambiorix> thx!
[06:09:41] <em2> hello
[06:09:45] <em2> if anyone would know
[06:10:16] <em2> how to use jquery to first scroll one div to bottom before continuing to scroll page downward
[06:11:14] <decx> huh?`
[06:11:42] <em2> it goes allright if mouse is located in that exact div, but i need to make it so that mouse position doesnt matter
[06:12:15] <jParkton> a name
[06:12:21] <jParkton> a href
[06:12:23] <jParkton> kgo
[06:12:45] <jParkton> controlling the users mouse is pretty annoying
[06:12:50] <em2> has no one had to make a site that would first scroll to the bottom of one element before whole page is triggered
[06:12:58] <jParkton> yeah
[06:13:13] <jParkton> plenty im sure lol
[06:13:20] <em2> thats why i ask :D
[06:13:21] <em2> here
[06:13:38] <em2> i've been googling for an hour now and cant find shit on this
[06:14:42] <jParkton> lel
[06:15:17] <BillCriswell> Hm, scroll events don't seem to bubble?
[06:15:47] <em2> i mean it sound something elemental
[06:16:32] <axilla> morning all, i'm using jquery in our rails app.. i'm trying to add a slider to my app using jquery ui.. i have //= require jquery.ui.all in my application.js file in rails, but the slider will not even function in its most basic of forms.  yet other jquery UI functions will work?
[06:16:46] <FilipNortic> if I want an anchortag inside a li-tag won't that be this selector: $('a > .active li'); ?
[06:17:09] <axilla> any ideas?  could we need to update our jquery ui? is the slider a recent release?
[06:19:47] <softplay> hello, i've this code, and the getJSON function is never executed, i cannot understand why http://jsbin.com/fenaxate/1/
[06:19:53] <softplay> can anyone help?
[06:19:59] <BillCriswell> decx: Are you playing with the scroll idea?
[06:20:41] <decx> as a matter of fact i do
[06:20:54] <drej> wat
[06:21:30] <BillCriswell> decx: As a matter of fact you are?
[06:21:33] <BillCriswell> drej: haha.
[06:21:50] <decx> as a matter of fact i am
[06:21:56] <drej> i had to read it 3 times to figure out if its his lack of sentence or my lack of coffee
[06:22:05] <decx> as a matter of carbon
[06:23:37] <BillCriswell> em2: http://jsbin.com/conekako/1/edit?css,js,output This is where I am.. lost interest kind of quick though. You should be able to take it from there haha.
[06:23:52] <softplay> hello
[06:24:11] <BillCriswell> em2: You'll have to get the direction the user is going to scroll back up as well.
[06:24:26] <softplay> http://jsbin.com/fenaxate/1/ I have i problem with this code, it is not executing
[06:24:33] <BillCriswell> I think I just ate like... 29 blue berries
[06:25:01] <BillCriswell> softplay: Any error in the console
[06:25:26] <softplay> nothing
[06:26:49] <softplay> should I restart the browser?
[06:27:04] <BillCriswell> What if you do console.log(data); Are you seeing what you expect to get back?
[06:27:34] <BillCriswell> Also do console.log(typoeof data) and make sure it says object.
[06:28:54] <decx> what was wrong with that sentence?
[06:29:02] <softplay> ok i restarted the browser, now it's working but there is a type error
[06:29:14] <softplay> ty BillCriswell
[06:29:17] <decx> and i do the same thing BillCriswell
[06:29:28] <BillCriswell> I asked "decx: Are you playing with the scroll idea?" and you said "as a matter of fact i am"
[06:29:39] <BillCriswell> but I'm not positive you were talking to me either... which could be my concern haha
[06:29:44] <BillCriswell> could be my confusion*
[06:29:55] <decx> so it's not wrong
[06:29:56] <BillCriswell> softplay: No problem.
[06:30:04] <axilla> le sigh never mind, my co-worker informed me she stripped out the default styling for jquery ui, just need to style it myself its there ><
[06:30:04] <decx> anyway http://jsfiddle.net/decx/mG6rb/
[06:30:17] <axilla> silly me.
[06:30:29] <BillCriswell> decx: My bad, you said: "as a matter of fact i do" haha
[06:30:49] <decx> is there a difference?
[06:31:03] <decx> are you working on it - yes i am (working on it)
[06:31:10] <decx> are you working on it - yes i do (work on it)
[06:31:34] <BillCriswell> THe "yes i do" feels wrong to me?
[06:32:00] <decx> tense is the hardest part
[06:32:06] <decx> don't judge me ^^
[06:32:22] <BillCriswell> Haha deal
[06:32:53] <BillCriswell> Our code is almost identical.
[06:33:27] <BillCriswell> You should feel bad about that.
[06:33:39] <decx> i'm not the one hardcoding height
[06:33:50] <BillCriswell> Hey pal it's a demo.
[06:34:10] <decx> scrollheight and height() should be cached beforehand anyway
[06:34:16] <decx> dat inefficient scroll function
[06:35:52] <BillCriswell> True
[06:35:58] <BillCriswell> I'm cleaning it up now.
[06:42:34] <BillCriswell> Kind of.
[07:07:55] <crooksey> I am using getJSON to get a json string, and display it on my page, this works fine, can anyone help me loop through each result and format it and display in my table (shown in paste) I have tried adapting several tutorials I came across, but can't seem to get it to work, here is the example with the raw JSON data, http://paste.ofcode.org/UZYAAhbpSv8ekZws7htgSJ
[07:08:33] <Cork> crooksey: see the answer i gave you the last time you asked
[07:08:52] <crooksey> Have changed my code since then
[07:11:46] <noi__> Is there any workaround for having some element position:fixed on mobile devices so it does not zoom in / getting resized when the user zooms in on the page? I tried to recalculate the position + size based on the current zoom level, but unfortunately that doesn't really look smooth. The content of the website should be zoomable, just the overlay should be non zoomable, so viewport is not an option
[07:13:53] <dave_4> hello there , need a little help
[07:16:34] <Forbidd3n> Anyone have or know where I can get a recursive function for activerecord nested set behavior?
[07:17:31] <decx> noi__ you'll have to hijack gestureend and scale the parts that should scale up yourself
[07:18:10] <decx> it's going to be a pain for you make and your visitors to use though
[07:21:01] <noi__> decx: Is it possible to dynamically change the viewport? Lets say I have the overlay, it sets the site to non zoomable, and as soon as the user closes the overlay the sites get zoomable again?
[07:21:38] <decx> no idea
[07:21:59] <BillCriswell> Any of you familiar with a feature in the andoird browser that basically magnifies a little portion of a screen into an overlay?
[07:37:50] <softplay> is it normal that prevent default doesn't work for any reason?
[07:37:53] <softplay> 	$(".two").click(function(){
[07:37:53] <softplay> 		event.preventDefault();
[07:38:45] <softplay> it should prevent a link to be clicked
[07:38:56] <softplay> but it doesn't
[07:39:08] <softplay> should i change the link to a button?
[07:40:32] <softplay> or maibe javascriptvoid?
[07:41:00] <decx> should be pretty obvious if you have the console open
[07:41:39] <softplay> ReferenceError: event is not defined
[07:41:49] <decx> there you go
[07:47:06] <thebloggu> can someone help me get a multi row sortable (with jquery ui) table to work. right now i have this: http://jsfiddle.net/z9G5Y/
[07:55:32] <VectorX> hi, can someone tell me why the toggle link is not working and how i can fix it, http://bit.ly/1oEi8Zo bascially the dropdown works with the red +, but i want it to work when you click on the Community link under Menu
[07:58:24] <thaifood> hi
[07:59:25] <thaifood> When i run 'bower install jquery-ui --save'  I don't get a jquery-ui.min.js or jquery-ui.js file, just individual js files like slider.js, any ideas please ?
[08:00:11] <TimmyTones> would someone be able to explain the significance of 'i' in the following statement?
[08:00:19] <TimmyTones> var result = [], // Create a new Array
[08:00:19] <TimmyTones>       i;
[08:00:36] <thaifood> TimmyTones: doesn't do anything
[08:00:41] <thaifood> do you have more code
[08:00:48] <decx> it just creates an empty var
[08:01:01] <decx> i guess there is a for loop under there which pushes stuff into result
[08:01:18] <TimmyTones> function map(f,a) {
[08:01:18] <TimmyTones>   var result = [], // Create a new Array
[08:01:18] <TimmyTones>       i;
[08:01:20] <TimmyTones>   for (i = 0; i != a.length; i++)
[08:01:20] <decx> so you do for (i = 0 instead of for (var i = 0
[08:01:22] <TimmyTones>     result[i] = f(a[i]);
[08:01:24] <TimmyTones>   return result;
[08:01:26] <TimmyTones> }
[08:01:28] <NoiseEee> TimmyTones: STOP
[08:01:33] <NoiseEee> TimmyTones: do not paste code here.
[08:01:41] <TimmyTones> how come?
[08:01:45] <thaifood> !paste
[08:01:45] <b-ot> thaifood: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:01:54] <thaifood> cuz it looks like you vomitted here
[08:02:32] <TimmyTones> its only a tiny amount but fair enough
[08:02:39] <thaifood> i could change the i to var i = '';
[08:02:53] <decx> doesnt matter
[08:02:59] <thaifood> it looks like hell
[08:04:58] <thaifood> When i run 'bower install jquery-ui --save'  I don't get a jquery-ui.min.js or jquery-ui.js file, just individual js files like slider.js, any ideas please ?
[08:05:08] <thaifood> google shows others had the problem too
[08:05:15] <thaifood> https://github.com/components/jqueryui/issues/32
[08:05:24] <thaifood> but it doesn't appear to be fixed
[08:18:23] <sukima> Is there a useful way to expose the eventlistener API on a jQuery promise object?
[08:19:32] <sukima> I have a function that returns a jQuery promise (using $.Deferred() internally) and that works fine but I also want to have an event I can trigger as a set of hooks priore to resolving/rejecting the promise
[08:20:48] <sukima> Using $(promise).on(...) works for the event but I loose the promise that way as it returns a jQuery object not a promise object. And promise objects don't have a .on() function. Could I monkey-patch it?
[08:20:58] <sukima> s/could/should/
[08:22:56] <sukima> promise.on = function() { $(this).on.apply(this, arguments); return this; }; promise.trigger = function() { $(this).trigger.apply(this, arguments); return this; };
[08:22:59] <sukima> ^ maybe?
[08:25:47] <jorvis> Can anyone please suggest a pagination plugin they like?  I want to transform an <ul> into a paginated element but have tried three plugins so far and each hasn't worked that well.
[08:25:55] <jorvis> There are so many, it's hard to tell which is a good one.
[08:29:31] <zeroquake> hey is it possible to change "y" in x.y    when needed
[08:30:20] <decx> when needed for what?
[08:30:20] <sukima> zeroquake: x.y = 'something'; // No?
[08:30:39] <sukima> jorvis: What about writing your own?
[08:31:13] <zeroquake> i mean say i have an array [a,b,c]    ---> nw i need to loop and execute x.a,x.b x.c
[08:31:54] <duch_kazatel> you mean x[i], where i is the index of that item ;)
[08:33:24] <duch_kazatel> gooood morning everybody.
[08:33:44] <jorvis> sukima:  When you search now there are already dozens - Seems to make more sense to use one that works than contribute yet another one.
[08:35:14] <zeroquake> x[i] means an array ---but here x is an object --- a,b,c are functions that i need to execute in order
[08:35:25] <duch_kazatel> arrays ARE objects.
[08:35:33] <duch_kazatel> and you can do that, though it's awkward.
[08:37:14] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/FT527/
[08:38:18] <duch_kazatel> keep in mind object properties have no order.
[08:38:24] <Tadas__> can't do more work as my account got locked out and my boss (who can unlock it) has gone home
[08:38:42] <duch_kazatel> zeroquake if order matters, use an array :)
[08:40:45] <Allen300> 'lo
[08:40:46] <Allen300> What's the different between using new XMLHttpRequest(); or $.ajax to send data?
[08:40:59] <duch_kazatel> one is the jquery wrapper.
[08:41:01] <zeroquake> am not sure how to explain this -- basically i need to have strings recognised as a object --- will set up a fiddle and post it here
[08:41:04] <duch_kazatel> the other is the underlying method.
[08:42:49] <duch_kazatel> zeroquake you can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/FT527/1/  though it's still awkward.
[08:42:56] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: which do you recommend?
[08:43:06] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 if you have jquery available, use $.ajax()
[08:43:16] <Allen300> Ah
[08:43:21] <duch_kazatel> keep in mind that is actually uses XMLHttpRequest under the hood.
[08:43:26] <Allen300> so the XMLHttpRequest() does not require jquery, I see
[08:43:56] <Allen300> When I send data through jquery, how do I send a file upload?
[08:44:02] <Allen300> obviously .val() doesn't work
[08:44:30] <sukima> Is there an easy way to mixin methods on the jQuery object onto other objects? For example myObject.on(), myObject.myFunc(), myObject.trigger()?
[08:45:36] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 lots of tutorials out there.
[08:45:45] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 you need to make an input of type="file"
[08:46:06] <Allen300> yes
[08:46:08] <duch_kazatel> sukima you mean other than just selecting the node and running it that way?
[08:46:12] <Allen300> okay I'll look into it thank you
[08:46:21] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 stackoverflow.com/questions/166221/how-can-i-upload-files-asynchronously-with-jquery
[08:46:30] <duch_kazatel> it's a lot simpler than you'd think :)
[08:46:32] <sukima> duch_kazatel: Yeah on a non DOM non jQuery object (like a promise object)
[08:46:53] <duch_kazatel> sukima mind sharing an example of what you're doing?
[08:46:59] <Allen300> what does asynchronously mean? I keep running into it and can't figure out what it means
[08:47:05] <sukima> duch_kazatel: standby...
[08:47:26] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 it's asynchronous to script execution - you fire off the ajax request and the rest of the code keeps trucking on.
[08:47:31] <duch_kazatel> instead of waiting for the request to complete.
[08:47:50] <delboy1978uk> my boss has changed the spec (AGAIN) and broke the website as a result
[08:47:56] <Allen300>  ahhh I see
[08:48:44] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 the nice thing is it doesn't block browser execution.  you simply have to make sure that you put all code that reliex on the ajax request completing in a callback for that ajax request.
[08:49:04] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax().done(function(){/* put your code here*/});
[08:49:13] <duch_kazatel> delboy1978uk i remember having those days.
[08:49:26] <delboy1978uk> i have a form with a select and i have the value (an integer), the form used to post, but now the vars need to go in the url, and instead of the number (of a location, incidentally) he needs it to say london or new-york or whatever. Given i have the selected value, how do i get the actual text from the dropdown?
[08:50:09] <duch_kazatel> delboy1978uk by looping through each <option> in the dropdown until you find the one with that value property.
[08:50:39] <delboy1978uk> yuk, really? thought there might have been a more elegant solution
[08:50:54] <delboy1978uk> ah well better get on with it
[08:51:23] <duch_kazatel> normally you don't do what you're doing ;) the value would be what you'd use.
[08:51:36] <delboy1978uk> yes i know lol
[08:51:51] <delboy1978uk> but the boss breaks things at a whim
[08:51:55] <delboy1978uk> no testing
[08:51:56] <zeroquake> thanks duch_kazatel
[08:51:58] <delboy1978uk> no planning
[08:52:03] <sukima> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/kajey/1/edit
[08:52:08] <duch_kazatel> zeroquake you figure it out?
[08:52:09] <delboy1978uk> it busts my chops!
[08:52:56] <zeroquake> i was going about it wrong -- i just needed some objects returned , was overthinking it . problem solved . Thank you :)
[08:53:19] <duch_kazatel> sukima your customPromisedFunc() needs to return the jquery object in that case.
[08:53:39] <delboy1978uk> there IS a more elegant solution! $("#list option[value='2']").text();
[08:54:04] <duch_kazatel> you can do that, but attribute selectors are gross.
[08:54:20] <delboy1978uk> if you say so lol
[08:54:30] <sukima> duch_kazatel: if so then I would loose the promise objects functions because it would be a jQuery object. That is why I was wondering if there was a easy mixin function to merge the two
[08:54:50] <duch_kazatel> wat
[08:55:49] <sukima> $( $.Deferred().promise() ).on(...).then(...) // fails as a jQuery() object has no then method. Hence a mixin
[08:56:15] <duch_kazatel> jquery objects DO have an .on() method.
[08:56:44] <sukima> Yup and promise objects do not. But promise objects have a then method where jquery objects do not.
[08:57:53] <sukima> jQuery().on is a function, jQuery().then is not / $.Deferred().promise().then is a function, $.Deferred().promise().on is not
[08:57:58] <duch_kazatel> you're munging your definitions - either way, you should attach to the defferred, not the promise.
[08:58:08] <duch_kazatel> i see what you're trying to say though.
[08:58:40] <delboy1978uk> quick way of url encoding a string?
[08:58:43] <sukima> I don't need to return a defered object I'm returning a promise The Deferred is for the customPromisedFunction to manage
[08:59:03] <duch_kazatel> delboy1978uk javascript has two methods - encodeURI and encodeURIComponent.
[08:59:08] <duch_kazatel> look at 'em on mdn.
[08:59:25] <sukima> A promise which also has an event listener API. I can write my own or mixin another library but why when jQuery has an event engine built in
[08:59:38] <sukima> Hence my can jQuery provide a mixin for that and if so is it easy?
[08:59:52] <duch_kazatel> sukima i think you're doing something very strange, but maybe somebody else will have an idea.
[09:00:27] <delboy1978uk> thanks duch_kazatel
[09:00:35] <delboy1978uk> mdn?
[09:00:45] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn
[09:00:46] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/
[09:00:48] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:00:51] <delboy1978uk> ah cool
[09:01:21] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn encodeURIComponent
[09:01:23] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: encodeURIComponent() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent
[09:09:36] <delboy1978uk> regex to get all whitespaces? http://regex101.com/r/gF9wA7/1 i can only seem to match one
[09:10:26] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/CTzKe/
[09:10:35] <duch_kazatel> you want /\s+/g
[09:11:05] <delboy1978uk> thanks :)
[09:11:24] <duch_kazatel> i thought you were converting things using those methods from earlier.
[09:11:41] <delboy1978uk> ah the g flag
[09:11:53] <delboy1978uk> yeah but the boss changed his mind AGAIN
[09:12:03] <duch_kazatel> i'd find a new company ;)
[09:12:05] <delboy1978uk> now he wants dashes instead of spaces
[09:12:15] <duch_kazatel> that's actually a safe bet.
[09:12:25] <duch_kazatel> shoulda changed the option values to what you actually want instead.
[09:12:34] <delboy1978uk> i agree, but i just hate the lack of planning, lack of testing, etc
[09:12:53] <delboy1978uk> i know but that would cascade break everything
[09:13:05] <duch_kazatel> >.> well okay.
[09:13:05] <delboy1978uk> so its more lava flow antipatterns
[09:13:32] <delboy1978uk> hacking around, its horrible! :'(
[09:14:00] <duch_kazatel> guess i'm just used to building stuff so that's kind of easy.
[09:14:40] <delboy1978uk> the site works fine the way it is
[09:14:51] <duch_kazatel> heh
[09:15:30] <delboy1978uk> but now i cant commit or push to my git till all the peculiarities he needs are sorted :-|
[09:22:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How do you get the current Y position in a scroll event?
[09:23:39] <duch_kazatel> $(window).scrollTop();
[09:23:40] <Ansikt> Why is my JSONP request failing? http://jsfiddle.net/nyu3u/
[09:23:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx
[09:24:33] <Omar-> guys, on which version ".live()" was removed? 1.8?
[09:24:39] <duch_kazatel> Ansikt jsonp: false, ?
[09:24:42] <duch_kazatel> Omar- 1.9 iirc.
[09:24:42] <Omar-> it was deprecated on 1.7
[09:24:57] <Omar-> duch_kazatel thanks ;)
[09:25:49] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel: That prevents jQuery from adding the _callback parameter to the url, right?
[09:26:02] <duch_kazatel> Ansikt wtf you can't use jsonp on images.
[09:26:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> duch_kazatel: it's weird, when I scroll with mousewheel this value is correct but when I press left and hold on scrollbar and go down, it doesn't
[09:26:28] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't what?
[09:26:46] <duch_kazatel> Ansikt what are you trying to do?
[09:27:00] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel: I updated with a bit more info.  Take another look here: http://jsfiddle.net/nyu3u/1/
[09:27:17] <duch_kazatel> Ansikt http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/DeluxeForms/BB_E3030C this URL is an image.
[09:27:22] <Ansikt> It's not an image with those params, it's a jsonp response.
[09:27:22] <duch_kazatel> you cannot use JSONP on an image
[09:27:36] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel, look at the actual request being generated by your browser.
[09:27:48] <Ansikt> sorry, it's a confusing api :\
[09:27:48] <decx> holding the scrollbar should fire the scroll event just fine
[09:29:07] <duch_kazatel> Ansikt one sec.
[09:29:33] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel: Thanks.
[09:30:54] <BillCriswell> The internet is so fast without JS.
[09:31:05] <Ansikt> BillCriswell: Fast and boring.
[09:31:12] <BillCriswell> Ansikt: Haha.
[09:31:30] <MikeD_> it'd be even faster without all those pesky server-side scripting languages
[09:31:38] <duch_kazatel> oh this isn't an actual jsonp thing :(
[09:32:27] <decx> it really is
[09:32:51] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel: What do you mean?
[09:32:53] <duch_kazatel> Ansikt do you have the ability to control the server-side here?
[09:33:07] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel: Nope.  What's the issue?
[09:33:20] <duch_kazatel> normally you specify your own callback name instead of them doing it for you.
[09:33:47] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel: Isn't that what jsonp : false, jsonpCallback : "callbackName" is for?
[09:33:56] <duch_kazatel> Ansikt http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/DeluxeForms/BB_E3030C?req=imageprops%2Cjson
[09:34:05] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make any sense.
[09:34:23] <duch_kazatel> also they're not declaring their encoding.
[09:34:43] <Ansikt> what doesn't make sense?
[09:34:57] <Ansikt> the %2C is a comma
[09:35:12] <duch_kazatel> they should let you specify the callback function name and they need to declare the encoding.
[09:36:08] <Ansikt> That's the problem?  Ugh.  Alright, I'll just do it in plain jane JS.
[09:36:22] <duch_kazatel> no, that just doesn't make sense.
[09:36:25] <duch_kazatel> lazy API devs.
[09:38:19] <syzygy___> having some difficulty getting .focus() to work on touch ( ipad ). Anyone dealt with this?
[09:40:29] <duch_kazatel> Ansikt http://jsfiddle.net/nyu3u/3/ they're doing something REALLY funky on their end.
[09:45:30] <MikeD_> is there a plugin for "box with header that expands/collapses on click of the header" ?
[09:45:43] <duch_kazatel> you're thinking of an accordion.
[09:46:10] <MikeD_> if you can have more than one section open in the accordion at a time, yeah.
[09:46:20] <decx> write the 5 lines it takes?
[09:46:22] <duch_kazatel> and no need for a plugin.  you could easily write that yourself OR use jquery ui
[09:47:04] <MikeD_> my first thought is write everything myself, but then I have problems handing it over to so-called "commodity maintenance programmers"
[09:47:16] <duch_kazatel> and they are?
[09:48:24] <MikeD_> relatively unskilled and easy to hire/contract
[09:48:58] <duch_kazatel> dunno what that has to do with you writing code.
[09:49:23] <decx> it's just a click handler with a traversal, how hard can it be
[09:49:44] <duch_kazatel> yeah, super simple stuff.
[09:50:37] <MikeD_> ok, ok..  just wanted to get some feedback.  Of course it's simple stuff, but you (all) think "simple" is anything you already know how to do - right?
[09:50:46] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:51:01] <duch_kazatel> "simple" is "stuff that i can pretty easily envision how to do without writing any code"
[09:51:08] <Ansikt> MikeD_: it's mostly css.  Like, almost entirely.  Here's all the js you need:
[09:52:31] <decx> no js huh, that's ambitious
[09:52:38] <Ansikt> jQuery(function(){jQuery(".accordion-header").on("click", function(){var $this = jQuery(e.target); var $accordion = $this.closest(".accordion"); $accordion.toggleClass("active");})})
[09:53:10] <Ansikt> MikeD_: And if your downstream developers can't understand that, then God help you.
[09:53:25] <decx> $(this).next().slideToggle() would have sufficed
[09:54:13] <Teduardo> Is anyone aware of a way to make sure that when a user supplies a phone number it is in E.164 format? I am having the biggest problem with this as everyone seems to enter phone numbers in different formats and then twilio can't call them
[09:54:25] <Ansikt> decx: I prefer using my own css classes, because I can do stuff like add an active state to the header or use my own transitions or whatnot.
[09:55:03] <Ansikt> Teduaro: on change of the input, grep all the numbers, format them how you like, then set the input
[09:55:10] <Ansikt> 's value to the formatted version
[09:55:17] <Ansikt> Or really, onkeyup.
[09:55:59] <Ansikt> I've also used the jQuery mask plugin with some success in the past.
[09:58:58] <Teduardo> Ansikt: okay, i guess what i mean is that the jquery would need to know all of the various rules for each country
[09:59:26] <Teduardo> im assuming someone has already ran into this problem but i've been having the hardest time finding a good way to deal with it
[09:59:47] <duch_kazatel> Teduardo strip everything but numbers and then reformat as appropirate.
[09:59:51] <duch_kazatel> *appropriate.
[10:00:03] <decx> i say let people input whatever form of number () / - they want and let the backend handle it
[10:00:10] <MikeD_> Teduardo: if you accept that there isn't a perfect solution, you only have to get something that's good enough for your normal use-case(s)
[10:03:49] <Ansikt> Teduaro : Do you do i18n right now?
[10:04:36] <duch_kazatel> Teduardo you should be able to autoformat the numbers correctly.
[10:06:06] <Ansikt> Teduardo: Because my  suggestion would just be to store some objects for different phone number formats for the interpolation function, then just inforce that format however.
[10:06:35] <Ansikt> Ideally, using whatever i18n system you have today (I would assume you're using one if you're running into this problem)
[10:07:58] <Teduardo> yeah, its just tricky to get a working number more than 40% of the time
[10:08:07] <Teduardo> at least from international users
[10:09:46] <BillCriswell> This stinks. I have something happening in Chrome on a Nexus that's not happening in Chrome on my desktop.
[10:11:33] <BillCriswell> Debugging sucks.
[10:12:20] <NoiseEee> android browsers sucl
[10:12:21] <NoiseEee> suck
[10:12:41] <NoiseEee> http://slides.com/html5test/the-android-browser#/
[10:13:54] <BillCriswell> What a fucking mess.
[10:15:16] <BillCriswell> I actually want to cry looking through this.
[10:16:12] <mpaarating> i’m having a bit of trouble getting .toggle() to work, can someone peek at this and tell me what I may be missing?

[10:16:30] <zeroquake> oh my !! i dont do android but -- should be like hell testing stuff in it
[10:17:40] <BillCriswell> It really makes me appreciate iOS right now.
[10:19:59] <decx> nth-child(i) wont work
[10:20:15] <BillCriswell> decx: Did you check your megabits?
[10:20:19] <decx> i is a variable and your css selector isnt
[10:20:30] <decx> i downloaded 64mb more ram
[10:20:35] <MikeD_> if I already have a jquery object and I want to get first level children, do I use myref.children("> div") ?
[10:20:48] <decx> only children() will do
[10:21:12] <decx> '> div' for find()
[10:21:42] <MikeD_> thanks
[10:28:07] <BillCriswell> Now the USB cord is being a dumbass.
[10:30:09] <BillCriswell> Had to try plugging it in 15 times instead of once.
[10:30:16] <BillCriswell> Should have stayed home today haha
[10:35:55] <BillCriswell> Browser detection strikes again.
[10:36:40] <djQuery_> feature detection ftw
[10:39:14] <duch_kazatel> sure, until you do something really stupid for IE11 and touch.
[10:40:11] <BillCriswell> There's so much crap to keep track of. ='(
[10:40:30] <BillCriswell> It used to be kind of fun.
[10:40:50] <duch_kazatel> IE11 has touch support and will say as much always.  even when you're not on a touch device.
[10:41:51] <BillCriswell> Good times.
[10:54:50] <axilla> hi all, i have a modal window with a slider on it that adjust the opacity of a div and will let our users customize the opacity.. how can I target the value of a label on the page beneth the modal window?
[10:54:54] <axilla> with jquery
[10:55:31] <duch_kazatel> normally?
[10:56:12] <axilla> https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/e88e6ac72a018434e57e
[10:56:49] <axilla> that's my slider code.. #login_box_opacity is on the page which loads the modal, the slider is in a modal window.
[10:57:10] <axilla> the modal is loaded when you click on a button.  nothing to fancy
[10:57:20] <duch_kazatel> var slider = $('#slider'); $("#slider").slider({ >.>
[10:57:34] <duch_kazatel> the modal has nothing to do with the selector.
[10:58:12] <axilla> yes, my slider is working fine
[10:58:22] <decx> hehe nice cache
[10:58:31] <axilla> i'm just having trouble selecting the value of a label
[10:58:43] <axilla> to change the value as the slider moves..
[10:58:45] <axilla> see my code.
[10:58:58] <duch_kazatel> oh, you want the value of the input that a label is tied to.
[10:59:20] <axilla> i want to set the value of the label, correct
[10:59:28] <duch_kazatel> labels don't have values.
[10:59:41] <axilla> ahh, well that would explain it.. thought i read it has a value.
[10:59:48] <duch_kazatel> labels have text.
[10:59:53] <duch_kazatel> inputs have values
[11:00:12] <axilla> .text
[11:00:16] <axilla> thanks duch
[11:01:20] <axilla> that did it, thanks :)
[11:03:06] <Miles8of9> hi guys i'm experimenting with jquery... i would like to add options to a select using jquery http://jsfiddle.net/rGFUD/
[11:04:10] <Miles8of9> this should be a plugin....  $(this).append(o); where this is the object on which the plugin is called
[11:04:49] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:04:49] <Miles8of9> but inside an each cycle i can access "that" this
[11:04:58] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is the current "State"
[11:05:10] <Miles8of9> right
[11:05:27] <PantsOfChoco> you are appending to the state in that example right?
[11:05:37] <Miles8of9> yes
[11:05:42] <duch_kazatel> wait what?
[11:05:55] <PantsOfChoco> you want to append to the list
[11:05:59] <Miles8of9> yes
[11:06:00] <PantsOfChoco> not the current state
[11:06:03] <Miles8of9> no
[11:06:09] <PantsOfChoco> your selector
[11:06:10] <BillCriswell> This comcast call going around the internet is hilarious.
[11:06:14] <PantsOfChoco> is the current state not the list
[11:06:18] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell the super high pressure one?
[11:06:22] <PantsOfChoco> WHY WONT YOU STAY WITH COMCAST?
[11:06:27] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 could you try to re-explain what you want?
[11:06:28] <PantsOfChoco> JUST TELL ME WHY
[11:06:34] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yes.
[11:06:45] <BillCriswell> There's no way I'd be able to keep my cool.
[11:06:49] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell yeah i felt bad for Ryan.  that dude was getting pretty abusive.
[11:06:54] <duch_kazatel> wonder what comcast is going to do about it.
[11:07:04] <BillCriswell> They apologized.
[11:07:05] <Miles8of9> duch_kazatel: i want to add options to a select using jquery... cycle through an array and add options
[11:07:09] <PantsOfChoco> make people wait even longer
[11:07:18] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 a "select" is an element.
[11:07:18] <BillCriswell> comcast should offer to pay for their Verizon service for a year for that shit.
[11:07:24] <duch_kazatel> and array is an object.
[11:07:29] <duch_kazatel> those are not the same task.
[11:07:42] <duch_kazatel> if you want to add something to an array, .push() it in.
[11:07:45] <BillCriswell> That would be a good headline.
[11:08:00] <PantsOfChoco> too bad comcast and time warner are the worst
[11:08:06] <jorvis> Can anyone please suggest a pagination plugin they like?  I want to transform an <ul> into a paginated element but have tried three plugins so far and each hasn't worked that well.
[11:08:09] <Miles8of9> i want to read the array and insert values as options to the select
[11:08:09] <duch_kazatel> i've actually never had a problem with comcast.
[11:08:09] <PantsOfChoco> and they are gonna merge into 1 mega worst
[11:08:20] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 that makes more sense.
[11:09:28] <Miles8of9> as this is a plugin i can't hardcode select id
[11:09:36] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 that's fine.
[11:09:47] <duch_kazatel> you're getting confused about the `this` object.  one sec.
[11:10:11] <Miles8of9> $(myStates).append(item);
[11:10:19] <Miles8of9> o
[11:12:12] <decx> new Option(item) is that a thing?
[11:12:19] <duch_kazatel> yeah, but a weird way to do it.
[11:12:31] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 also, totally don't need to use $.each() in this case
[11:13:15] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/rGFUD/3/
[11:13:42] <duch_kazatel> you chould basically cache the node that the selector was run against and then reference back to that.
[11:14:01] <Rudeboy> Hey guys. I have a list of comments. I want to display only 4 and hide the rest. I have the following code, but it's only working on the SECOND click, and then clicking on "less comments" does not work. Can anyone possibly help? http://pastebin.com/FdaC5cjY
[11:14:28] <duch_kazatel> Rudeboy use event delegation instead.
[11:14:30] <decx> Miles8of9 i'd say separate your *plugin* from the data http://jsfiddle.net/decx/YrP7G/
[11:15:06] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: I have no idea what that is ha ha:) Gonna look it up quick
[11:15:48] <duch_kazatel> Rudeboy $(parent).on('event', 'target', function() {});
[11:15:52] <duch_kazatel> what you're doing now is hacky.
[11:16:11] <duch_kazatel> that way you aren't doing that binding as apart of your apend.
[11:16:50] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: It's based on code I found on Stack Exchange. Still trying to learn jQuery :) Thanks for your suggestion, just trying to make sense of it
[11:17:02] <duch_kazatel> don't bind inside of an .append()\
[11:17:17] <duch_kazatel> append just the HTML.
[11:17:58] <duch_kazatel> what's up with that return btw?
[11:18:29] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Don't ask me ha ha:)
[11:18:37] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: It's all very confusing for me
[11:18:42] <duch_kazatel> let me show you.
[11:19:05] <PantsOfChoco> he can show you the world...
[11:19:15] <duch_kazatel> http://fixee.org/paste/aopnzxi/
[11:19:24] <Rudeboy> PantsOfChoco: He does sound like quite a jQuery ninja :)
[11:19:39] <PantsOfChoco> damnit NOONE GOES WITH THE ALADDIN REFERENCE
[11:19:48] <duch_kazatel> shining, shimmering cooooooode
[11:19:56] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Holy smoke, that was quick! Having a look at it :)
[11:19:59] <decx> should have used the a whole new world gif PantsOfChoco
[11:20:23] <decx> PantsOfChoco http://i.imgur.com/SqfuGRz.gif
[11:20:30] <duch_kazatel> woops fixee.org/paste/aopnzxi/
[11:20:40] <duch_kazatel> forgot the period in the first selector.
[11:21:14] <PantsOfChoco> more like this decx http://i124.photobucket.com/albums/p2/blackrosekirby/nigel-thornberry-aladdin.gif
[11:21:18] <duch_kazatel> so first off, events bubble up through the document - the first bit of code is a delegated listener.
[11:21:51] <duch_kazatel> that way you don't have to add a new listener for every LI.  you can just listen for them higher up.
[11:22:06] <decx> PantsOfChoco tagged: #useImgurFgt
[11:22:13] <duch_kazatel> also, don't just return; out of an each. return true or false
[11:23:03] <PantsOfChoco> NEVER
[11:23:31] <decx> at least it wasnt tinypic
[11:25:00] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Thanks so much for that and your comments above, going to save them for future reference. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be working though:/ It hides the comments, but clicking on 'show more' doesn't do anything?
[11:25:46] <PantsOfChoco> note to self, only tinypic all the time
[11:28:12] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/ekolo/339/
[11:30:52] <Miles8of9> ah ok thanks a lot
[11:32:23] <duch_kazatel> sorry was away.
[11:32:25] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[11:33:20] <duch_kazatel> Rudeboy do you see why?
[11:34:05] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Not yet, but I have a feeling that I'm missing something obvious ha ha
[11:34:16] <duch_kazatel> also, you have an extra opening a tag in your first li
[11:35:24] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Oops, thanks :)
[11:35:52] <duch_kazatel> okay, so you want to display 4 and hide the rest, then on click of your toggler, you want to show all of them, right?
[11:36:04] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Correct
[11:36:13] <duch_kazatel> let's gut that .on() first :)
[11:37:32] * frank_o does his "i just fixed a bug" dance :D :D :D
[11:37:56] <duch_kazatel> Rudeboy this should get you started: http://jsfiddle.net/MQJAV/
[11:39:40] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: You're gonna have to give me a moment :)
[11:39:48] <duch_kazatel> I know.
[11:39:51] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[11:41:20] <Rudeboy> duch in jQuery, do variables need $ appended?
[11:41:32] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Above:)
[11:41:44] <duch_kazatel> no, but it's really good practice.
[11:42:01] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: ok :)
[11:42:42] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Should I not put the variables right at the top?
[11:43:19] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:43:41] <duch_kazatel> you should declare all vars at the top of a function, imo.
[11:43:51] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Never mind ha ha, doesn't work then
[11:44:08] <duch_kazatel> did you mean at the top of the entire file?
[11:44:18] <Rudeboy> Yea
[11:44:26] <duch_kazatel> some you can (and should).  others you can't.
[11:53:30] <frank_o> Is there a way to reuse a global variable object like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ma3LT/ ?
[11:53:41] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/MQJAV/1/
[11:54:05] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Ha ha jokes:) flip this is difficult
[11:56:20] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/MQJAV/2/
[11:56:36] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Am i kinda right or completely wrong?
[11:56:40] <decx> frank_o test1 doesnt exist because you've overwritten the object
[11:56:52] <BinaryKitten> Rudeboy hello
[11:56:55] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Oops, hold on
[11:57:00] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: Hey :)
[11:57:04] <decx> what's with the global vars anyway and why do you attach them to the jquery object?
[11:57:08] <BinaryKitten> i recognise that code
[11:57:08] <decx> *global*
[11:58:53] <Rudeboy> http://jsfiddle.net/MQJAV/3/
[11:58:58] <Rudeboy> oh glory
[11:59:02] <Rudeboy> my brain hurts
[11:59:04] <duch_kazatel> aaand on my way out.
[11:59:17] <Rudeboy> now i'm doomed
[11:59:18] <BinaryKitten> Rudeboy what's not working?
[11:59:33] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: The whole thing ha ha'
[11:59:58] <frank_o> decx: Normally I wouldn't, but in this case they need to be defined inside jquery mobile ($(document).on('pagecontainershow', function())
[12:00:06] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/MQJAV/1/ seemed to work once you commented out the scream
[12:01:06] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: Ha ha yes:) But its only half the code. The 'more comments' needs to change to 'less comments' which then hides the extra comments again
[12:01:20] <BinaryKitten> right
[12:01:24] <BinaryKitten> give me 5 mins
[12:01:33] <jftf> I want to grab a particular class name that starts with a string and hold it in a variable. Do I do this with $.grep?
[12:01:36] <BinaryKitten> though i'm sure i did this before
[12:02:24] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: Thanks so much!
[12:02:28] <decx> Rudeboy http://jsfiddle.net/decx/MQJAV/4/
[12:03:19] <BinaryKitten> decx you broke the multi list support
[12:03:36] <decx> i only see one list :(
[12:03:44] <BinaryKitten> yeah, demo code
[12:04:11] <Rudeboy> decx: Thanks for that :) Almost there..
[12:04:23] <Rudeboy> I didn't think this would be so complicated!
[12:04:35] <decx> there http://jsfiddle.net/decx/MQJAV/5/
[12:05:56] <Rudeboy> decx: That's awesome. Although, unfortunately I need the 'more' toggle button to change to a 'less' button that then hides the extra list items again
[12:06:18] <decx> well don't hide
[12:06:32] <decx> you can do it, just bolieve
[12:06:37] <frank_o> So yeah. Can I reuse an object like this: $.GLOBAL_VAR = { test1: "Hey 1" }; $.GLOBAL_VAR = { test2: "Hey 2" }; -- as opposed to having to create $.GLOBAL_VAR1 and $.GLOBAL_VAR2?
[12:07:39] <tiblock> Hi. Does jquery have event for "onload" event of page? I mean when all images and CSS and everything is loaded?
[12:07:42] <Rudeboy> decx: I can barely see past my headache from working on this:/ Must push on!
[12:08:43] <frank_o> that's right Rudeboy always keep it moving !!
[12:11:49] <tiblock> oh wait, my question solved

[12:13:28] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: Thanks sooooooo much!
[12:13:33] <BinaryKitten> bare with me
[12:13:40] <BinaryKitten> this can be cleaned up
[12:14:19] <decx> even showing the length of the hidden ones? showoff
[12:14:33] <decx> but yes, other than the cursor pointer css that's mine as well ^^
[12:15:08] <riso> can somebodygive me a hand withthis? http://pastebin.com/0cTeiSwn trying to fill the radio from the form with elements from a list I get back
[12:16:20] <decx> what kind of url is searchValue.form?

[12:19:41] <BinaryKitten> these slip ups happen when you have a headache
[12:19:55] <decx> being the man has nothing to do with gender

[12:20:13] <BinaryKitten> decx no but "thanks so much man" does..
[12:20:22] <BinaryKitten> lol ..
[12:20:26] <decx> oh right
[12:20:34] <BinaryKitten> usually i try to stray away from gender-politics..
[12:20:44] <BinaryKitten> it gets messy real-quick
[12:20:54] <BinaryKitten> i'm a developer .. i code therefore i am
[12:21:02] <decx> beauty of the internet
[12:22:25] <Rudeboy> I am, therefore I think I am. I think..
[12:23:07] <dave_4> here on http://budgettraveldeals.co.uk/,  on right sidebar, once you click Quote now, you'll see book now button which will open up a pop, i've a checkbox which return false even when it's checked
[12:23:34] <decx> this whole sentience thing is just background noise from the brain

[12:25:21] <BinaryKitten> no worries

[12:37:24] <BinaryKitten> and function based text update
[12:37:40] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: Hole in one?
[12:38:34] <decx> Rudeboy it's annoying to me, but apparently clients love it
[12:38:44] <BinaryKitten> decx agreed,,
[12:38:48] <decx> i had to implement my fair share of animated to top buttons -.-
[12:38:58] <decx> always kills me
[12:39:16] <marc_v92> decx: It’ll go the way of animated gifs. A novel idea, but once that wears off, people will want to get back to navigating and finding information as easily/quickly as possible.
[12:39:18] <BinaryKitten> decx not sure if we can improve beyond 12
[12:39:34] <decx> we can by going native
[12:39:42] <decx> woop woop
[12:39:46] <BinaryKitten> yeah, but that's not jQuery
[12:40:07] <decx> we'll just frame it in a plugin ;)
[12:40:12] <BinaryKitten> lmfao
[12:40:33] <Rudeboy> decx: I put the animation in there because the comments drop down quite far, so when you hide them, the rest of the page comes rushing across the viewport. Thought it would make sense to take the user back to where they were
[12:41:59] <Miles8of9> http://jsfiddle.net/4xBJk/  <--- ???
[12:43:06] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: There's a problem with your code: it's too advanced!! Ha ha I can't even figure out where to put my animated scroll event!
[12:43:45] <decx> in the click function
[12:43:55] <BinaryKitten> Rudeboy between lines 24 and 25.. or not at all.. because they suck :p
[12:45:03] <nicolas_leonidas> shouldn't this work when a new element with data-scrollbar=true is added to the page? $(document).delegate('[data-scrollbar=true]', 'ready', function() { console.log('hi3') });
[12:45:54] <Miles8of9> how do i call that select from within a plugin?
[12:48:36] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: But how can I only make it scroll when hiding, and not both?
[12:48:48] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: Should I maybe stick with the second last version you created?
[12:50:46] <jftf> What's wrong with my code? https://gist.github.com/josephdburdick/4b9769053a2690e6fffc I'm trying to grab an item out of an array to store as a variable
[12:50:47] <decx> Miles8of9 it's this
[12:52:06] <Miles8of9> awesome
[12:55:23] <marc_v92> jftf: When using indexOf, to check if something is not in the target, you have to use -1, not 0.
[12:57:12] <decx> Miles8of9 have some defaults and support for multiple http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4xBJk/2/
[12:59:19] <Zall> jftf: use this instead http://jsfiddle.net/zWb36/

[13:07:21] <il> How can I* get highcharts to display my data from certain divs? http://jsfiddle.net/24dK7/
[13:10:57] <IHateHavingToReg> am i escaping this properly?
[13:11:10] <IHateHavingToReg> 			var myUserResults = $('<CENTER><H2 class=\"newquote\">Nope</H2></CENTER>');
[13:11:50] <Tekla> umm... i think if you put ""s inside ''s you don't need to use \s
[13:12:02] <IHateHavingToReg> ok
[13:12:07] <decx> you dont need to escape there when you mix quotes
[13:13:35] <IHateHavingToReg> So then I have an actual problem, not a syntax problem. So when something gets clicked, that myUserResults is appended to something. That shows up fine. But then I have a $(".newquote").on('click', ...) listener which doesn't seem to be receiving anything. Is it, by chance, because class="newquote" doesn't exist when the HTML loads?
[13:14:42] <nicolas_leonidas> can someone help me with this? I want to console.log a message every time a new element is added to body http://jsfiddle.net/7uDqH/4/
[13:16:35] <nicolas_leonidas> is this possible to do? should I use .delegate?
[13:17:56] <BinaryKitten> decx, rubinhozzz
[13:17:58] <BinaryKitten> oops
[13:18:02] <BinaryKitten> Rudeboy decx
[13:18:11] <BinaryKitten> i've not got transitions working yet

[13:19:54] <BinaryKitten> so want to get it animating lol
[13:20:30] <BinaryKitten> been a while since i've done it native
[13:20:38] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel what do you think ?
[13:21:18] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel: Rudeboy's issue solved - http://jsfiddle.net/MQJAV/12/    and a close approximation in native js: http://jsfiddle.net/Pxw6n/1/
[13:22:45] <decx> i for one am impressed
[13:22:58] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: I for one almost fell off my chair
[13:23:01] <decx> but do more write less indeed
[13:23:14] <BinaryKitten> yep, this is while jQuery ftw
[13:23:20] <PantsOfChoco> jquery is amazing
[13:24:16] <BinaryKitten> decx it's been nice duelling with you
[13:24:25] <nicolas_leonidas> PantsOfChoco: it's not, cause no one in #jquery is helping me
[13:24:27] <BinaryKitten> given my nogging a nice workout
[13:24:37] <decx> fedora tip
[13:24:49] <PantsOfChoco> whats yo problem son
[13:24:50] <BinaryKitten> nicolas_leonidas there is no "detection" for new items
[13:24:58] <PantsOfChoco> im terrible at jquery i just chill here
[13:25:00] <iamviknesh> i cant find Firefox OS in jquery mobile support list :( i hope it supports
[13:25:23] <decx> well if you want to go on i'm fiddling around with a honey comb pattern http://jsfiddle.net/decx/X9c3C/2/
[13:25:28] <nicolas_leonidas> BinaryKitten: can you elaborate?
[13:25:39] <BinaryKitten> nicolas_leonidas you can trigger on events..
[13:25:44] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: I got a headache trying to code it myself, now I'm getting a headache just trying to work out your ridiculously advanced code ha ha :)
[13:25:51] <BinaryKitten> there is no event "i've added sonething to the dom" nicolas_leonidas
[13:26:01] <arschmitz> iamviknesh: it is tested against it but not super actively because our test devices have some issues sadly
[13:26:10] <nicolas_leonidas> BinaryKitten: why doesn't .ready work for a new element?
[13:26:26] <BinaryKitten> because the document ready is for dom ready
[13:26:30] <arschmitz> iamviknesh: but it is supported and if you find issues we will fix them
[13:26:32] <BinaryKitten> the dom is already ready
[13:26:40] <iamviknesh> arschmitz: so does it mean its not fully supported ??
[13:27:05] <arschmitz> iamviknesh: just that its not tested as actively but we do support it
[13:27:30] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: I've implemented your awesome code, can you just please explain to a noob again where to put my scroll event ha ha :)
[13:27:51] <iamviknesh> arschmitz: ok fine , k if i get into any issue , i will report :)
[13:27:59] <BinaryKitten> Rudeboy in http://jsfiddle.net/MQJAV/12/ between lines 24/25
[13:28:01] <nicolas_leonidas> BinaryKitten: ok I see
[13:29:06] <BinaryKitten> nicolas_leonidas the closest you can get is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[13:30:22] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: Oh yes ha ha, thanks:) I'm half brain dead from trying to understand what you did there ha ha:)
[13:30:24] <IHateHavingToReg> can <H2 class="newquote"> have a 'click' on Event? or does it have to be like an img or button or something else?
[13:30:39] <BinaryKitten> IHateHavingToReg yes it can
[13:30:42] <decx> you can make a custom event and trigger that somewhere nicolas_leonidas
[13:30:43] <BinaryKitten> everything has a click event
[13:30:46] <IHateHavingToReg> thx
[13:31:34] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: Although it still scrolls to the top when expanding instead of only when collapsing?
[13:31:56] <BinaryKitten> urm .. brain just went off

[13:32:50] <BinaryKitten> UK
[13:33:09] <pu239> if i want to sort a nested list (and move items to new nodes) do i need a 3rd party tool? jquery ui won't handle it by default, right?
[13:33:20] <nicolas_leonidas> decx: it works for the example on jsfiddle but not the real problem I'm dealing with, since there are many parts of the code that change the page and I can't add a trigger to all
[13:33:36] <Rudeboy> BinaryKitten: South Africa this side
[13:33:43] <decx> delegate with on
[13:33:57] <yurakeshi> nicolas_leonidas $(document).bind('DOMNodeInserted', function(event) { console.log('inserted ' + event.target.nodeName + ' in ' + event.relatedNode.nodeName); });
[13:34:08] <duch_kazatel> don't use .bind()
[13:34:10] <duch_kazatel> use .on()
[13:34:21] <BinaryKitten> yurakeshi DOMNodeInserted is deprecated
[13:34:40] <BinaryKitten> yurakeshi see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Mutation_events

[13:35:15] <Rudeboy> decx: And thanks so much to you too! :)

[13:36:04] <duch_kazatel> nice.
[13:36:21] <Rudeboy> duch_kazatel: Hey:) Yea, BinaryKitten and decx have been  a great help :) I was waiting for you to get back so I could say thanks to you for all your help as well! :)
[13:36:37] <duch_kazatel> nah they were actually helpful.
[13:36:40] <duch_kazatel> i never am :)
[13:36:46] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel lies!

[13:42:31] <nicolas_leonidas> decx: thanks for that but it wouldn't work for my case, I've narrowed down a problem to a smaller one to be able to discuss it here, what you did works for the narrowed down problem not the actual problem
[13:45:23] <yurakeshi> nicolas_leonidas, DOMNodeInserted is deprecated, but still works
[13:45:37] <BillCriswell> Here I am.
[13:45:47] <PantsOfChoco> this chat has too many happy faces :(
[13:45:58] <BillCriswell> It sounds like armageddon outside so I might lose internet soon.
[13:46:18] <jimi_> does .on('change') catch when jquery updates an element?
[13:46:24] <yurakeshi> PantsOfChoco don't u like to see happy faces?
[13:46:40] <PantsOfChoco> im a programmer i hate fun and happiness
[13:47:19] <yurakeshi> jimi_, if u use .val('newvalue') you have to call .change() too: $el.val(1).change();
[13:47:35] <jimi_> yurakeshi, or .trigger('change'); ?
[13:47:35] <yurakeshi> PantsOfChoco, iam a programmer, i love fun and happiness ^^
[13:47:50] <yurakeshi> jimi_, sure, samething
[13:48:21] <BillCriswell> I like sprite from a can.
[13:48:44] <PantsOfChoco> sprite is delicious but their marketing pisses me off
[13:48:56] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: Not Mountain Dew: Code Red from a glass bottle?
[13:49:07] <BillCriswell> marc_v92: No way. Plain sprite in a can.
[13:49:19] <BillCriswell> PantsOfChoco: I have no idea about their marketing haha
[13:50:07] <decx> ugh
[13:50:15] <decx> the only soda i drink is vita cola
[13:50:22] <PantsOfChoco> gross
[13:50:29] <BillCriswell> I don't know if I've ever tried that.
[13:50:40] <PantsOfChoco> sprite markets predominately to black people, i feel like everyone likes sprite though
[13:50:54] <oste> how can i select data attributes with any value?
[13:50:57] <marc_v92> Sprite is a pretty safe choice.
[13:51:04] <BillCriswell> oste: .foo[src]
[13:51:06] <marc_v92> $(“element[attribute]")
[13:51:16] <oste> $('[data-test=^””]’)
[13:51:23] <NoiseEee> PantsOfChoco: i would have never made that observation
[13:51:41] <oste> BillCriswell it needs to have data-test=“value”
[13:51:44] <oste> value can be anything
[13:51:46] <PantsOfChoco> hahaha maybe its just the areas ive lived my whole life im around enough ads to notice it
[13:52:12] <oste> i was hoping the ^ would work but no lukc
[13:52:14] <BillCriswell> oste: The actual data or the data attribute?
[13:52:19] <marc_v92> $(“element[attribute=*]”) ? Untested, no idea if that would work.
[13:52:22] <BillCriswell> oste: [data-foo] should work just fine.
[13:52:36] <BillCriswell> I feel like having to do this is a little weird though.
[13:52:45] <decx> yeah no need for the even more wasteful selectors
[13:52:48] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: I think he needs to make sure that there’s some value, though. If I’m understand him correctly. So <element attribute /> should fail
[13:53:02] <oste> value can be anything
[13:53:14] <oste> so if it has data-test=“yep"
[13:53:18] <oste> data-test="nope"
[13:53:21] <oste> i want them both
[13:53:34] <oste> based on the data attribute
[13:53:39] <marc_v92> oste: Just use $(“element[attribute]”); then.
[13:54:04] <oste> i dont understand
[13:54:20] <oste> element[attribute]?
[13:54:29] <marc_v92> $(“#myDiv[data-yepnope]”)
[13:54:30] <BillCriswell> element[data-test]
[13:54:31] <NoiseEee> what kind of element are you seeking?
[13:54:45] * thang sizzles
[13:54:45] <oste> it does not matter what kind of elements.
[13:54:55] <marc_v92> Will trap for any element with the ID of “myDiv” that has an attribute “data-yepnope”, regardless of what the attribute’s value is.
[13:54:56] <oste> i want everything with data-test=“***"
[13:55:04] <marc_v92> $(“*[data-test]”);
[13:55:08] <NoiseEee> $('[data-test]')
[13:55:15] <marc_v92> NoiseEee +1
[13:55:16] <BillCriswell> $('[data-test]') would do it.
[13:55:29] <BillCriswell> Thought everyone here said that a few times lol
[13:55:31] <oste> phew
[13:55:33] <NoiseEee> lol
[13:55:33] <BillCriswell> Ok, escape time.
[13:56:02] <marc_v92> Same here, approaching 5pm. Time to go home and get some food. Later, all.
[13:57:30] <PantsOfChoco> screw all yall east coasters!

[13:59:15] <toad> Hi, how to send multiselect values to server by json?
[14:15:51] <il> How can I* get highcharts to display my data from certain divs? http://jsfiddle.net/24dK7/
[14:16:12] <jftf> Why doesn't this function return with a value? http://jsfiddle.net/6BVb2/3/
[14:18:02] <Zall> jftf: because you are returning from the wrong function
[14:18:43] <Zall> return always returns the function that it's called in..
[14:19:30] <jftf> Zall: how do i return from the fucntion i am mean to call from?
[14:19:45] <Zall> jftf: try this http://jsfiddle.net/6BVb2/4/
[14:21:04] <jftf> Zall lemme try this out
[14:21:07] <jftf> thanks for helping
[14:21:43] <jftf> Zall...
[14:21:46] <jftf> christ
[14:21:53] <jftf> worked on this for a while
[14:21:55] <jftf> thank you
[14:21:56] <decx> what kind of esoteric usecase is this anyway?
[14:22:09] <jftf> decx: talkin to me?
[14:22:15] <decx> yes, why not $('body').is('.blah')
[14:22:30] <jftf> because the class is actually not completely known
[14:22:40] <jftf> i only know the beginning ofthe class
[14:22:51] <jftf> postid is actually postid-231123
[14:22:59] <jftf> so i want to grab that class name
[14:23:04] <decx> you can use an attribute selector
[14:23:44] <jftf> it's not the only class in that object. $('body').attr('class') returns an array
[14:23:48] <jftf> which si where i started
[14:24:05] <decx> $('body[class*="post"]')
[14:24:45] <decx> but if you just want to know when you are on a posts page then just add another class in your output
[14:26:01] <jftf> decx: the problem is not that I don't know which page I'm on. I'm looking for a specific class in the body because this postid-12312 class tells me which post I'm favoriting with ajax
[14:26:22] <jftf> the author of the plugin messed it up and this is a temporary fallback
[14:31:15] <Zall> jftf: how about this: document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].className.match(/post-([0-9]+)/)[1];
[14:32:39] <Zall> that should give you the ID of the post, if that's what you're after
[14:34:11] <Zall> or if you really want to use jQuery: $("body").attr("class").match(/post-([0-9]+)/)[1];
[14:35:14] <duch_kazatel> .prop('class')
[14:35:16] <duch_kazatel> don't use .attr()
[14:35:36] <duch_kazatel> you can also test if it .hasClass();
[14:36:19] <yurakeshi> duch_kazatel, what's the diff between .prop() and .attr?
[14:36:31] <duch_kazatel> one reads the dom node, the other the markup.
[14:36:36] <duch_kazatel> you generally want the DOM node.
[14:36:55] <yurakeshi> nice, thanks
[14:37:00] <il> How can I* get highcharts to display my data from certain divs? http://jsfiddle.net/24dK7/
[14:37:19] <duch_kazatel> woaaaah.
[14:37:33] <naeluh> is there a way to get a half of a for loop ?
[14:37:51] <duch_kazatel> il use the "external resources" on the left to insert scripts.
[14:37:52] <decx> stop in the middle?
[14:38:02] <duch_kazatel> naeluh you can specify any length.
[14:38:18] <duch_kazatel> for (var i = 0; i < (arrayLength / 2); i++) {}
[14:38:55] <decx> you can also break
[14:39:09] <naeluh> cool yeah so how would I get to the other half then ?
[14:39:11] <naeluh>  thanks
[14:39:46] <naeluh> change it to greater than ?
[14:39:58] <duch_kazatel> by going in reverse.
[14:40:34] <decx> why do you want to split a loop anyway if you need both halfs?
[14:40:49] <naeluh> cause I want to something to part of them
[14:41:01] <decx> but you have all the info inside the loop
[14:41:07] <naeluh> yeah
[14:41:17] <decx> if i>arrayLength/2 do stuff else do other stuff
[14:41:27] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[14:41:38] <duch_kazatel> you can also iterate backwards, but....
[14:41:39] <duch_kazatel> y'know.
[14:41:40] <duch_kazatel> math
[14:41:52] <naeluh> yeah I am super tired thanks
[14:45:15] <yurakeshi> il, your idea is right, you have to parse the elements into an array of data, but the format of your data array is not acceptable by HighCharts. Take a look at the documentation
[14:47:16] <il> yurakeshi, ah ok, thanks
[14:48:34] <riso> hi, I have a list I get from a model of spring mvc, now I need to fill a form based on those values           http://pastebin.com/jG2R2igV
[15:00:01] <acidjazz> so i got this particular issue
[15:00:38] <acidjazz> im inside an object/function w/ a handler inside boudn to a div, outside functionality that does display none/block on a parent div kills this handler.  what are my options/
[15:00:40] <acidjazz> ?
[15:00:49] <riso> is there a way to fill a c:foreach with jquery?
[15:01:03] <acidjazz> whats a c:foreach
[15:02:51] <Zall> acidjazz: without a jsfiddle reproduction of the issue, I doubt anyone will understand what you mean
[15:06:04] <decx> il your markup has multiple elements with the same id
[15:06:12] <decx> oh i was scrolled up
[15:07:40] <damiano> hi
[15:07:54] <sc_> ciao a tuti
[15:07:58] <damiano> :)
[15:08:29] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz functions are objects.
[15:08:32] <duch_kazatel> your question is strange.
[15:11:52] <Miles8of9> decx: what would happen if i get data from a json request instead of hardcoded array? should i parse json and turn into array?
[15:12:12] <decx> Miles8of9 you're in luck that wsa the last thing i tested
[15:12:23] <Miles8of9> lol

[15:14:32] <Miles8of9> $.getJSON("json.php", function(data) { console.log(data); });
[15:14:57] <Miles8of9> this gives the json string
[15:15:47] <duch_kazatel> parseJSON
[15:15:58] <duch_kazatel> err, JSON.parse()
[15:16:49] <Zall> you don't need to JSON.parse it
[15:16:55] <Zall> it is already an object
[15:17:18] <duch_kazatel> he said it's returning a string.
[15:17:44] <decx> Miles8of9 something like this http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4xBJk/3/
[15:17:47] <dm7freek> Is it true that the top of the window when you scroll all the way down on a page is $(document).height()-$(window).height() ?
[15:18:45] <duch_kazatel> dm7freek basically.  you have to account for the offset of the window when you get to the bottom.
[15:19:03] <dm7freek> duch_kazatel: what do you mean / how do i do that?
[15:19:06] <Miles8of9> decx: thanks
[15:19:24] <duch_kazatel> dm7freek think about it.
[15:20:10] <dm7freek> duch_kazatel: you mean the offset of the window within the browser (i.e. what i said is true if you're in fullscreen mode) ?
[15:20:36] <duch_kazatel> the offset of the window (the current viepost) in relation to the document.
[15:21:08] <duch_kazatel> *viewport
[15:22:19] <dm7freek> duch_kazatel: I'm not rly sure what you mean. By default the window scrollTop is 0 right? then you can scroll until the bottom of the viewport (window scrollTop + window height) an the document align, no?
[15:22:51] <dm7freek> *bottom of the document
[15:27:34] <duch_kazatel> dm7freek when you scroll to the bottom of the page, the top of the window isn't the bottom of the document - that's why you can still see content/
[15:28:25] <decx> hehe
[15:29:03] <dm7freek> duch_kazatel: so then to get the scrollTop of the window at that point is the same as getting document height and subtracting window height, right?
[15:50:30] <frank_o> Is there a way to reuse global variables in an object like this: $.GLOBAL_VAR = { test1: "Hey 1" }; $.GLOBAL_VAR = { test2: "Hey 2" }; -- as opposed to having to create $.GLOBAL_VAR1 and $.GLOBAL_VAR2?
[15:50:42] <duch_kazatel> don't attach global vars to jquery.
[15:51:07] <frank_o> * reuse an object for global variables
[15:51:14] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: I see
[15:51:38] <duch_kazatel> but yes - var MyGlobal = {};  MyGlobal.test1 = 'Hey 1'; MyGlobal.test2 = 'Hey 2';
[15:51:51] <duch_kazatel> also, vars in all caps are often assumed to be constants that will never change.
[15:52:04] <duch_kazatel> camelcase instead.
[15:52:10] <frank_o> ah excellent
[15:52:12] <frank_o> thanks for the tips
[15:52:24] <duch_kazatel> you did something similar in here yesterday.
[15:52:30] <frank_o> Kinda yeah
[15:52:32] <duch_kazatel> don't attach to jquery unless you're making a plugin ;)
[15:53:03] <decx> even then it's no problem to have a private function for a quick convenience function
[15:53:26] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[15:53:33] <frank_o> But I need to define these variables inside a jQuery Mobile's $(document).on('pagecontainershow', function() and i cant seem to access them globally unless i use a jquery object
[15:53:41] <frank_o> * inside jQuery Mobile's
[15:54:08] <decx> just because element.myjqmethod() looks better doesnt mean that an oldfashioned myjqmethod(element,options) function cant be better
[15:54:22] <decx> you don't attach it everywhere with jquery so that's nice
[15:54:24] <duch_kazatel> frank_o that's because you're doing it wrong and haven't read about scopes ;)
[15:54:45] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/8mTd6/
[15:54:46] <duch_kazatel> do this.
[15:55:13] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: wow :)
[15:55:23] <frank_o> looks tasty!
[15:55:47] <frank_o> yummy
[15:55:50] <frank_o> thanks a lot fellas
[15:57:27] <duch_kazatel> you'd do well to read up on scoping.
[15:57:48] <decx> how did you get so far without it anyway? it's kinda amazing
[15:57:54] <frank_o> i surely will
[15:58:05] <frank_o> haha beats me =)
[15:58:10] <decx> did you just put globals everywhere?
[15:58:18] <decx> maintainers hate him
[15:58:20] <decx> ^^
[15:58:21] <frank_o> if you want something bad enough the universe always has a way of making it happen i guess
[15:58:27] <duch_kazatel> O.o
[15:58:38] <duch_kazatel> i don't get the "good enough" attitude.  i always feel like I could do better.
[16:04:57] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: i feel you on that one
[16:05:04] <frank_o> makes it hard to finish projects though
[16:05:23] <duch_kazatel> imo that should be apart of the project itself.
[16:05:39] <decx> you sir have never dealth with stingy clients directly
[16:05:45] <decx> -h
[16:05:55] <duch_kazatel> nope ;)
[16:05:59] <frank_o> :)
[16:05:59] <duch_kazatel> well, actually..
[16:06:13] <duch_kazatel> i did have to for a while.
[16:06:17] <duch_kazatel> fuck that noise.  never again.
[16:09:49] <nolsen> Hello, I'm looking for good comprehensive material on jQuery. I've found the API docs useful but I was wondering if there are any books, guides, etc you guys would recommend? Specifically I'm looking for very comprehensive material that goes over advanced issues
[16:09:56] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com
[16:10:15] <duch_kazatel> also http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[16:10:46] <nolsen> OK great, thank you. :d
[16:10:49] <decx> think of a dom manipulation related problem that you have no idea how to solve it and then solve it
[16:10:56] <duch_kazatel> yeah that too.
[16:30:33] <duch_kazatel> jesus i get down to the last bits of this mootools deprecation and find out there's even more.
[16:30:38] <Miles8of9> decx: i'm trying to produce some json output.. and i get something like {"1":"Alabama","2":"Alaska","3":"Arizona","4":"Arkansas" ..... etc etc... which is good json but jquery can't understand it... why?
[16:30:57] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 what do you mean "jquery can't understand it"?
[16:31:09] <decx> the script assumes a flat array
[16:31:17] <Miles8of9> i simply created an array in php and ran json_encode
[16:31:36] <duch_kazatel> that's not an array in javascript.
[16:32:00] <duch_kazatel> a js array would be ['Alabama', 'Alaska', 'Arizona'....]
[16:32:09] <Miles8of9> key value
[16:32:24] <duch_kazatel> arrays in js just have values.
[16:32:26] <duch_kazatel> no keys.
[16:32:34] <Miles8of9> mmmm
[16:32:45] <systemfault> Ah PHP… making people think that maps are arrays since its beginning.
[16:33:25] <duch_kazatel> you can think of javascript objects as similar to associatie arrays or hashes.
[16:35:08] <decx> an object like that doesnt have length does it?
[16:35:15] <Miles8of9> no
[16:35:23] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:35:26] <Miles8of9> that was the problem
[16:35:29] <duch_kazatel> well, not natively.
[16:35:39] <duch_kazatel> there's Object.keys(theObject).length iirc.
[16:35:44] <systemfault> Yup
[16:36:06] <duch_kazatel> but that's not available everywhere iirc.
[16:36:19] <decx> can you change your json output?
[16:36:24] <Miles8of9> yes
[16:36:43] <decx> check the dummy for the example http://www.json-generator.com/api/json/get/cqOVylsSCq?indent=2
[16:36:45] <systemfault> es5-shim :)
[16:37:06] <duch_kazatel> systemfault sometimes we don't get that luxury :)
[16:37:18] <Miles8of9> fantastic =)
[16:37:33] <Miles8of9> i saw it
[16:38:02] <Miles8of9> it's an array of objects
[16:39:16] <kirkland_> if I use $.getScript, is that JS cached by the browser?
[16:39:24] <decx> yes
[16:39:36] <kirkland_> cool, thanks
[16:39:37] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/ <- this even tells you.
[16:39:54] <duch_kazatel> By default, $.getScript() sets the cache setting to false. This appends a timestamped query parameter to the request URL to ensure that the browser downloads the script each time it is requested. You can override this feature by setting the cache property globally using $.ajaxSetup():
[16:40:25] <Miles8of9> what if i want to produce an array made of key-values?
[16:40:43] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 huh?
[16:41:01] <systemfault> Miles8of9: associative arrays are “objects” in JS
[16:41:13] <duch_kazatel> you cannot have named keys with arrays.
[16:41:25] <duch_kazatel> arrays are made up of objects.
[16:41:26] <Miles8of9> ehmmm my question goes beyond the topic of the channel..
[16:41:33] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily.
[16:41:40] <kirkland_> duch_kazatel got it, thanks
[16:42:14] <Miles8of9> $arr = array ( new Object ( ?
[16:42:18] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:42:33] <duch_kazatel> wait what language?
[16:42:38] <Miles8of9> php
[16:43:01] <duch_kazatel> oh, then yeah you'll want to ask in the php channel.  btw don't use new Object() in js ;)
[16:44:22] <decx> for your purposes it would probably be best to have a json like this [{ name: 'Country Name', code: 'CN' },{ name: ..... ]
[16:44:31] <duch_kazatel> ^^ yeah that.
[16:44:36] <decx> then you can use name as text for your option and code for your value
[16:45:19] <Miles8of9> right
[16:47:06] <decx> Miles8of9 like here http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4xBJk/4/
[16:47:22] <decx> god i love json-generator
[16:47:51] <decx> [ '{{repeat(50)}}', { name: '{{country()}}', code: '{{lorem(1, "words")}}' }]
[16:48:03] <Miles8of9> !
[16:48:13] <Miles8of9> lol
[16:50:23] <Miles8of9> my aim is to produce some kind of jquery (widget?) with this functionality
[16:50:25] <Miles8of9> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iCr6t04-bk
[16:51:01] <duch_kazatel> an autocomplete dealio?
[16:51:07] <Miles8of9> jquery's autocomplete is very limited by commas
[16:51:14] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:51:35] <decx> try https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/
[16:52:25] <Miles8of9> no multiple values
[16:52:33] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:52:50] <decx> what like an AND search?
[16:53:11] <decx> or multiselect
[16:53:28] <Miles8of9> plain multiselect has a problem
[16:53:43] <decx> not just one if you ask me
[16:53:44] <Miles8of9> it's painful to use on large data sets
[16:54:04] <Miles8of9> what if i have 5000 entries?
[16:54:42] <decx> if i want checkboxes i use checkboxes and not a select, but that's me
[16:54:54] <Miles8of9> what if want to associate 2 authors to a book.....?
[16:55:15] <Miles8of9> but there are 5000 authors that i can choose from
[16:55:42] <decx> better get that solr ready and buy lube
[16:55:52] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's a SOLR problem imo.
[16:56:04] <duch_kazatel> don't manage this kind of data in JS.
[16:56:24] <duch_kazatel> unless you're doing some kind of document store, then you just need some good forethought and data organization.
[16:56:36] <Miles8of9> solr?
[16:56:44] <duch_kazatel> it's a searching and indexing system.
[16:56:52] <duch_kazatel> !g solr
[16:56:53] <Miles8of9> ah
[16:56:53] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Apache Lucene - Apache Solr → http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
[16:57:02] <duch_kazatel> we use it here.
[16:57:57] <Miles8of9> say you need to create some kind of book database
[16:58:37] <duch_kazatel> don't do that with JS.
[16:58:39] <duch_kazatel> :)
[16:59:04] <Miles8of9> of course php and mysql are my friends :P
[16:59:22] <duch_kazatel> you mean to say you have relational data going on
[16:59:25] <duch_kazatel> ? ;)
[16:59:59] <Miles8of9> why not?
[17:00:22] <duch_kazatel> i'm saying you have relational data - that's what you use SQL for.
[17:00:41] <Miles8of9> i have...
[17:01:50] <Miles8of9> solr is some kind of nosql database
[17:02:00] <duch_kazatel> that's not what you use it for...
[17:02:15] <duch_kazatel> you use it for search instead of querying your SQL db.
[17:02:26] <duch_kazatel> we use it for our product search.
[17:02:57] <Miles8of9> omg it's all written in java!
[17:03:04] <duch_kazatel> oh noes!
[17:03:18] <duch_kazatel> (it's also mind-blowingly fast)
[17:03:31] <Miles8of9> petabytes of ram will be consumed in the process
[17:03:35] <duch_kazatel> not for us.
[17:03:43] <duch_kazatel> don't be lazy and you'll be fine.
[17:04:18] <duch_kazatel> the java of today is MUCH better than old java.
[17:05:00] <Miles8of9> nosql databases are not good for ecommerce.... what if they ask me to be able to sell those books?
[17:05:16] <duch_kazatel> i all ready said you don't use this to store your data.
[17:05:19] <duch_kazatel> you search using it.
[17:05:28] <duch_kazatel> i work for a large ecommerce company that uses it just fine.
[17:05:33] <duch_kazatel> we sell plenty of products.
[17:05:43] <duch_kazatel> well, okay, we'd be medium.
[17:06:08] <Miles8of9> so.... i store data in mysql and search using solr?
[17:06:23] <duch_kazatel> you store your data the way you currently do and create indexes with it using SOLR.
[17:07:02] <duch_kazatel> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Solr
[17:07:09] <Miles8of9> ok..... right... but in admin area i need that kind of widget i said previously :P
[17:07:19] <duch_kazatel> right, and the widget would hit SOLR.
[17:07:32] <Miles8of9> ?_?
[17:08:23] <Miles8of9> let's say i create a book from admin area..... title... description....... author/s .......
[17:09:34] <Miles8of9> i have an authors table with thousands of authors and i need to associate 2 of them with the book
[17:10:58] <Miles8of9> there are several problems that none of jquery widgets solves at moment
[17:11:17] <Miles8of9> so i need to write a new one... :|
[17:11:25] <duch_kazatel> none of those are jquery problems.
[17:13:05] <Miles8of9> 2.12am in my country.... probably i'm not understanding because of that
[17:14:22] <Miles8of9> ok....... you open your admin area and click "add new book".... you get a form where you have to fill book's data
[17:14:45] <duch_kazatel> you need to build a RESTful interface to work with.
[17:15:31] <duch_kazatel> don't manipulate your data in your frontend.
[17:17:22] <Miles8of9> how do you associate N authors to your book?
[17:17:50] <duch_kazatel> visually?
[17:17:55] <Miles8of9> yes
[17:18:40] <duch_kazatel> I'd have an autocomplete search box and a list of "added authors" somewhere.
[17:19:02] <Miles8of9> ooook
[17:19:16] <duch_kazatel> instead of some crazy dropdown with checkboxes.
[17:19:47] <Miles8of9> that dropdown is some kind of suggestion from the autocomplete
[17:19:59] <duch_kazatel> sure - just use a plain autocomplete.
[17:20:16] <duch_kazatel> munging input types is hard to get right, and even when it's right it feels awkward.
[17:20:17] <Miles8of9> checkboxes allow you to remove association which is questionable ok
[17:20:46] <Miles8of9> my idea is different.....
[17:21:12] <Miles8of9> you have an autocomplete box that gets data from some json etc
[17:21:20] <duch_kazatel> nope - you want a search dropdown and a checkbox next to each name so you can click to associate.
[17:21:30] <duch_kazatel> i watched the video ;)
[17:22:19] <Miles8of9> yes...... the dropdown allows you to select among results received from json autocomplete
[17:22:29] <duch_kazatel> don't do that - that's munging input controls together.
[17:23:30] <Miles8of9> even google does that.................
[17:23:35] <Miles8of9> is it so wrong?
[17:23:42] <duch_kazatel> where does google do that?
[17:23:57] <duch_kazatel> the autocomplete is not the issue, btw.
[17:24:01] <duch_kazatel> with the dropdown suggestions.
[17:24:06] <duch_kazatel> it's the checkboxes that are weird.
[17:24:25] <Miles8of9> burn the fkin checkboxes lol
[17:24:37] <davesleep> anyone here used jcrop?
[17:24:44] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ davesleep
[17:24:44] <b-ot> davesleep: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:25:08] <davesleep> i want to be able to set the boxwidth on the fly
[17:25:12] <davesleep> but it doesnt seem to work
[17:25:21] <duch_kazatel> can you share an example?
[17:25:45] <davesleep> erm.. i dont think so, i was just wondering if anyone else had done it and if it's possible
[17:26:09] <duch_kazatel> if you have a small example use case of your current code we might be able to help.
[17:26:15] <duch_kazatel> let me look for their docs.
[17:26:36] <Miles8of9> if i open google and type something i get a dropdown with suggestions .... stupid example. i type "mi".... dropdown shows "microsoft" and "mickey mouse"
[17:26:36] <davesleep> like, it's just one line of code,  Jcrop({ boxWidth: windowWidth, boxHeight:windowHeight})
[17:26:48] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 that's not the part i'm arguing against.
[17:26:54] <davesleep> that's the line, i want it to be responsive, i really really dont want to write my own cropper tool
[17:27:20] <davesleep> Jcrop({ boxWidth: , boxHeight: })
[17:27:24] <davesleep> it's in its advanced settings
[17:27:39] <duch_kazatel> davesleep you could .destroy() and reinitialize.
[17:27:48] <davesleep> yeah, i thought i may have to do that
[17:27:57] <Miles8of9> duch_kazatel: oook...... checkboxes can be simple links "Remove".. if you click link, author is removed from association with the book
[17:28:00] <davesleep> but on ever resize :/ i suppose i could set a timer
[17:28:06] <Miles8of9> is it better?
[17:28:17] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 don't put the add/remove control as apart of that dropdown.
[17:28:24] <duch_kazatel> davesleep huh?
[17:28:30] <duch_kazatel> on every resize of what?
[17:28:34] <davesleep> the window
[17:28:48] <davesleep> i'm putting it in an overlay
[17:28:51] <duch_kazatel> you can bind to the window's resize event.
[17:28:59] <davesleep> yup i am
[17:29:05] <duch_kazatel> then why would you need the timer?
[17:29:05] <davesleep> but it would be laggy wouldn't it
[17:29:15] <duch_kazatel> not if you do it right.
[17:29:17] <Miles8of9> no no well..... not exactly the dropdown..... i mean the list of associated authors
[17:29:47] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 yeah - that's what I said earlier.
[17:31:20] <Miles8of9> so....... i create an autocomplete with dropdown.... when user clicks on an entry, it's added to a list of associated entries.....
[17:31:41] <Miles8of9> which is right below the autocomplete box
[17:31:48] <duch_kazatel> don't put it there.
[17:31:49] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[17:31:57] <Miles8of9> eeeeeeeeek!!
[17:32:05] <Miles8of9> where?
[17:32:47] <duch_kazatel> do the left maybe?>
[17:32:53] <duch_kazatel> dunno what your current page looks like.
[17:33:23] <donni> anyone use bootsrap here?
[17:33:40] <duch_kazatel> donni you might have better luck in a channel about bootstrap ;)
[17:33:56] <donni> #tab bootstrap
[17:33:58] <voronika> i only use it them pull myself up.
[17:35:04] <Miles8of9> http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/    this one is pretty good but doesn't allow multiselect + remote data source
[17:35:28] <Miles8of9> look at Multi-Value Select Boxes
[17:35:32] <duch_kazatel> ...
[17:35:58] <duch_kazatel> 1. you don't need/want multiselect
[17:36:02] <duch_kazatel> 2. http://i.imgur.com/XNVTjBl.png
[17:36:17] <duch_kazatel> "It supports [...] remote data sets [...]"
[17:36:32] <Sal> hi
[17:36:57] <Sal> does anyone know a function for an infinite list?
[17:36:58] <Miles8of9> yes... but not together multiselect + remote in the same control
[17:37:06] <duch_kazatel> you don't want multiselect.
[17:37:12] <duch_kazatel> Sal what do you mean?
[17:37:21] <Sal> i mean like on mobile, when you scroll to the bottom, it just triggers and does something
[17:37:39] <duch_kazatel> oh you mean infinite scroll.
[17:38:13] <duch_kazatel> lots of plugins and stuff out there.
[17:38:17] <duch_kazatel> easy enough to build on your own.
[17:38:17] <Sal> the best would be to find a plugin that can trigger events when page elements get a defined Y value inside browser window
[17:38:29] <Sal> i know i have it...
[17:38:33] <Miles8of9> duch_kazatel: i need the one in "Multi-Value Select Boxes".. but with remote data source... :P
[17:38:34] <Sal> it was working...
[17:38:43] <Sal> but now i'm getting crazy on it
[17:38:51] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 that's exactly what you do not want to do.
[17:39:10] <Miles8of9> ?_?
[17:39:21] <Miles8of9> why?
[17:39:28] <duch_kazatel> because that's munging input types.
[17:39:51] <duch_kazatel> phrasing it differently isn't going to change my opionion.  i feel like i'm going around in circles at this point.
[17:39:53] <Sal> his is what i have now: if ( $(window).scrollTop() == $(document).height() ) { ... }
[17:39:56] <Sal> aint that good?
[17:40:10] <duch_kazatel> Sal nope.  you'll never meet that.
[17:40:17] <Sal> damn!
[17:40:21] <duch_kazatel> the top of the window will never hit the bottom of the document ;)
[17:40:47] <HowardwLo> if i want to indicate the width and height of an img tag, do i have to know it beforehand or is there a way to get it from the src ?
[17:40:48] <Sal> duch_kazatel, is there a way to control page elements in some way?
[17:41:05] <duch_kazatel> Sal you want to compare the scrollTop() of window to the document height() minus the window height,
[17:41:08] <Sal> like if a <p> top reaches windo Y do something
[17:41:14] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo do what now?
[17:41:33] <Sal> oh, damn, thats right.....
[17:41:39] <Sal> i deleted that part
[17:42:00] <HowardwLo> <img src=“some/place/.jpg” width=“23” height=“59”>
[17:42:05] <HowardwLo> the width and height tags
[17:42:40] <Miles8of9> duch_kazatel: could you please suggest me some orthodox looking way of solving the problem? :P
[17:47:28] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo *attributes, not tags.
[17:47:32] <duch_kazatel> and i'm still not sure what you're asking.
[17:47:37] <duch_kazatel> you can set them at any time.
[17:48:06] <duch_kazatel> $('img').prop('width', '50px');
[17:48:32] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to set the width and height to whatever the image is
[17:48:32] <duch_kazatel> ?
[17:51:32] <HowardwLo> ya, i wanted to set it to whatever the native size of the image is
[17:52:00] <duch_kazatel> why?
[17:52:06] <duch_kazatel> why not just leave them off?
[17:53:04] <donni> any reference to create a dropdown menu that shown by clicking?
[17:53:37] <duch_kazatel> donni sure - <option><select value="1">one!!!</select></option>
[17:53:43] <duch_kazatel> add more selects as you see fit :)
[17:54:36] <donni> -_- i want to put some accordion on it
[17:55:19] <duch_kazatel> http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/
[17:55:35] <duch_kazatel> check out the markup this generates and go nuts.
[17:56:00] <Miles8of9> it's very complicated
[17:56:18] <duch_kazatel> yep.  rolling your own selects is a PITA
[17:56:25] <duch_kazatel> iirc bootstrap has some stuff.
[18:27:08] <uskerine> hi
[18:27:36] <uskerine> how can I get a parameter passed within the GET method?   myPage.html?id=fooId?
[18:27:43] <uskerine> so I would like to get id
[18:28:31] <djQuery> uskerine, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values-in-javascript
[18:28:41] <uskerine> thanks
[18:30:02] <haleys> Is there a way to make my form submit when the user selects a file from a file field?
[18:33:57] <djQuery> haleys, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10214947/upload-files-using-input-type-file-field-with-change-event-not-always-firin
[18:38:56] <haleys> djQuery: Thanks
[18:51:20] <The_Ball> I'm using Smarty (template engine) to list out rows from a database, each row has a couple of buttons (CRUD), the only way I know to pass info about the id for each row is to embed it in the identifier and the explode it later. Is there a better way to pass extra identifiers for buttons?
[19:09:53] <djQuery> The_Ball, smarty works at the php lvl right?
[19:10:13] <djQuery> then yes you will need to give the <tr   and id representing the row
[19:10:21] <dave_4> hey there
[19:11:44] <djQuery> then on click of the button you can do something like $('table').on('click', 'button.delete', function(){ var id=$(this).closest('tr').attr('id')});
[19:12:43] <dave_4> i've form here http://budgettraveldeals.co.uk/test-form/  , one of the radiobutton even if checked return false in console, whenever i query meetgreet in console it returns false, what can be the cause but one more thing if  i assign the value  meetgreet= $('[name="meetgreet"]').is(':checked'); it returns true, is it about placement of code, please
[19:12:43] <dave_4>  guide me
[19:13:50] <supsup> sup
[19:14:18] <djQuery> #fscf_div_field3_8 > div:nth-child(2) > span > label
[19:15:59] <The_Ball> djQuery, ah, thanks for the information
[19:17:28] <djQuery> dave_4, works for m
[19:17:30] <djQuery> e
[19:18:17] <djQuery> dave_4, although from a user interface option you might want to give some way to uncheck it
[19:18:25] <dave_4> djQuery not working yet, simply query for meetgreet in console.log it returns false isn't it?
[19:18:42] <djQuery> dave_4, not if I click on it first
[19:20:31] <djQuery> dave_4, but then I am just running this in console
[19:21:01] <dave_4> running in console returns true that's what feels weird
[19:21:10] <dave_4> i've changed it checkbox now
[19:22:47] <djQuery> where where you going to be running this code?
[19:23:33] <dave_4> filename? or webpage?
[19:23:57] <djQuery> thats what I am asking on change or on submit or what
[19:24:44] <dave_4> before submit, on change
[19:25:56] <tiblock> Hi. Can you guys please confirm that $( handler ) calls when DOM ready, but not when page fully loaded. And also it is asynchronous. Because i think i misunerstanding something
[19:29:06] <rmill> tiblock: it depends where you’re placing your jQuery code.
[19:29:18] <rmill> typically you would put everything in domready
[19:29:26] <rmill> .api ready @ tiblock
[19:29:27] <b-ot> tiblock: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[19:29:59] <tiblock> rmill, well that exacly what i did. Everything in .ready and now i dont understand what i did and how it must work
[19:30:47] <tiblock> rmill, https://api.jquery.com/ready/ says nothing about "asynchronous". So i dont get it. It looks like it is, is that error in my code?
[19:32:05] <tiblock> rmill, also it says $() and $(document).ready() is the same, but i thought .ready() is for DOM ready and $() is for when page fully loads
[19:33:15] <tiblock> rmill, and also my test was showing that .width() will freeze DOM ready until page renders. So much stuff to think about
[19:34:28] <Whirl3d> what do I have to do to enable the syntax $(".someClass").alignment.position(); where position() is a method of an alignment object?
[19:34:47] <rmill> `$( document ).ready(function() {});` and `$(function() {} );` are the same, yes.
[19:34:53] <dave_4> djQuery anything on that
[19:34:56] <rmill> ↑ tiblock
[19:35:31] <tiblock> Whirl3d, do you mean $($(".someClass").alignment).position(); ?
[19:35:56] <tiblock> im just dont know what is ".alignment" but if its element, then that will solve
[19:37:02] <Whirl3d> alignment is a jquery method by extension. For example $.fn.alignment=function () { return "hello"}; would allow you to do $(".someClass").alignment() and get "hello"
[19:38:02] <Whirl3d> by assigning public methods to alignment, you should be able to use the syntax $(".someclass").alignment.publicmethod() to get your value. it's like namespacing
[19:39:04] <tiblock> Whirl3d, string dont have method "publicmethod". If you want method "on string" try object with .toString() method
[19:40:13] <djQuery> dave_4, well if I can access it at command line with $('[name="meetgreet"]').is(':checked') and get back the approiate value then you should be able to access it durring $('form').on('submit', function(){ console.log($('[name="meetgreet"]').is(':checked')) ;});
[19:40:45] <djQuery> dave_4, I not really understanding what the q is
[19:41:01] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/VFL9A/15/
[19:41:25] <Whirl3d> tiblock, shows that the test case "hello" method works
[19:41:42] <Whirl3d> you can ignore all the alignment stuff, just the last two lines
[19:41:59] <tiblock> Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/LWCXz/
[19:43:58] <tiblock> Whirl3d, is that solves your problem? Or this is not what you want?
[19:47:20] <Whirl3d> does it follow the syntax $("elem").alignment.position()?
[19:56:22] <measure34> so what might be wrong in this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/6mQ7x/
[19:56:26] <measure34> new to jquery
[19:56:42] <shoky> Whirl3d you can't do that.  that is, you can have such a "position" property on your $.fn.alignment method, but it would have no knowledge of what element you're running it on
[20:00:59] <acidjazz> measure34: that fiddle sir is homosexual i fin dit offensive
[20:02:02] <measure34> aha
[20:02:25] <measure34> guess i didnt realize
[20:05:31] <tandroid> measure34, what is it you're trying to do? Do you want to figure out who won every time a value is changed at all?
[20:06:43] <tandroid> The way you have it now only checks when the first value has changed.
[20:08:13] <measure34> tandroid: i want to figure it out depending the result if there is a winner team, loser or if it was a draw
[20:09:09] <tandroid> Right, but when do you want that to all get determined? When the user clickes a button, hits enter, presses a key, etc.
[20:10:33] <measure34> tandroid: the idea would be once both inputs are already filled out
[20:10:44] <measure34> local and visitor
[20:11:23] <tandroid> So maybe a button would be a good addition?
[20:11:42] <tandroid> Instead of on change, on click of the button?
[20:14:14] <measure34> tandroid: i already have a form submitt button that send the data
[20:22:11] <tandroid> measure34, Is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/6mQ7x/2/
[20:25:12] <measure34> tandroid: isnt suppose to work the same way with the onchange event
[20:25:27] <measure34> or keyup
[20:26:30] <tandroid> Well, the only issue there is that you need the keyup or onchange event on both inputs
[20:27:25] <measure34> tandroid: should i bind it on both?
[20:27:38] <Whirl3d> shoky! thanks. for the reply. What do they mean when they talk about namespacing your plugins?
[20:27:46] <tandroid> You could, you could do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/6mQ7x/3/
[20:32:15] <measure34> tandroid:  problem in that fiddle seems to be that u will always need to keyup visitor in order to update the values
[20:32:42] <tandroid> That's true.
[20:32:50] <shoky> Whirl3d: what do who mean?
[20:34:13] <tandroid> measure34: http://jsfiddle.net/6mQ7x/4/
[20:35:32] <shoky> Whirl3d: whoever them is, ask them ;P i'm goin to bed, nights
[20:36:09] <measure34> tandroid:  thanks man.. that helped me out
[20:36:19] <djQuery> Whirl3d, what if you create a function called createBox  what if someone else creates something called createBox
[20:36:32] <djQuery> whom ever created it last wins
[20:36:35] <Whirl3d> night. Sorry. I was in the other room. Sleep well
[20:36:48] <tandroid> measure34, You should also do some error handling to make sure you're getting a number and not a string.
[20:37:06] <djQuery> Whirl3d, but if yours is Whirl3d.createBox it is unlikely that it would get overwritten
[20:37:06] <tandroid> measure34: javascript wont give you an error and will actually turn the string into a numeric value.
[20:37:16] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I'm not gonna micromanage my users like that. If they are dumb enough to load two extensions for alignment, so be it.
[20:38:09] <Whirl3d> djQuery, thanks for the reply. I get the idea, but how do I implement it. In other words, what if I wanted my base to be "alignment"
[20:38:10] <measure34> tandroid: thats what im working on
[20:38:23] <djQuery> Whirl3d, http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-function-namespacing-plain-english/
[20:41:20] <Whirl3d> Sorry, it's not that I don't understand namespacing. I don't understand how to extend jquery to use namespacing for my plugin.
[20:42:15] <Whirl3d> in other words, I want all jquery objects to be able to define an "alignment point" that is an object contianing two dynamic parameters
[20:43:15] <Whirl3d> I want to be able to do various alignment functions within my alignment namespace so that I can use the $(selector).namespace.function() syntax
[20:57:21] <djQuery> Whirl3d, what kind of plugin are you writing?
[20:57:57] <djQuery> Whirl3d, is jquery ui going to be included allready?
[20:58:21] <djQuery> Whirl3d, the widget factory is a cool way to build plugins that does a lot of stuff for you
[21:00:47] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/g8bcj/
[21:01:09] <Whirl3d> There's a lot more to it, but that's the concept
[21:01:39] <Whirl3d> It's like being able to define a registration point for an object and then retrieve that point on any element
[21:01:53] <Whirl3d> either by named label like "topLeft" or by formula.
[21:02:57] <Whirl3d> of course, the logical extension of this idea is that the alignment methods would then take tween parameters to enable super amazing animations as well.
[21:04:23] <Whirl3d> $(".leftAligners").align("left") would lookup the formula for "left" in the library and apply it to all of the elements, picking the left most element as a reference.
[21:05:47] <Whirl3d> and the basic align function is x=elem.width()/widthRatio + xoffset;  y=elem.height().heightRatio + yoffset...
[21:44:20] <The_Ball> Is this valid for saving a reference to the original form.submit() method before replacing it? -> formSubmit = dialog.find("form").submit;
[21:52:57] <lamerion> why would you want to save the original form.submit() method though
[21:56:01] <The_Ball> lamerion, I want to run some validation in a dialog before actually submitting the form normally
[21:56:25] <The_Ball> lamerion, I'd rather not submit the form using ajax
[21:58:25] <lamerion> The_Ball: are you using a plugin? you might be able to hook into before submit and do your validation there
[22:00:26] <The_Ball> lamerion, I'm using dialog to present a dialog form which hooks into the submit button
[22:00:48] <The_Ball> as this example does http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form
[22:06:24] <lamerion> The_Ball: that example actually has validation before submitting the form normally? Isn't that what you wanted?
[22:07:59] <The_Ball> lamerion, yeah but it didn't actually submit the form. I figured it out thought
[22:08:36] <The_Ball> lamerion, by splitting the validation into a seperate function and then doing dialog.find( "form" ).on( "submit", function( event ) {    if (!validateInput())      	event.preventDefault();
[22:09:07] <The_Ball> and reducing the addUser() to if (validateInput())form.submit();
[22:09:30] <The_Ball> Now both submitting by hitting enter or clicking the dialog works
[22:13:03] <lamerion> The_Ball: i see, that would work too, you also can add the form.submit() code in the valid clause of the addUser. Theres just one of the ways you can do it
[22:21:55] <jsIsTough> which javascript libray is best to learn for SPAs? Single Page apps?how different are Angular.js,backbone.js,node.js from jquery ajax?
[22:31:30] <lamerion> jsIsTough: its kinda like asking what type of cake you prefer at a cafe though, each people will have their own opinions..
[23:50:40] <trampi> Hello. How can i parse uri parameters from window.location.search to get a JS-Hash?
[23:50:59] <Cork> trampi: you would have to do that manually
[23:51:03] <Cork> or use a plugin
[23:51:28] <trampi> Cork: Do you have any recommendations? Best practice?
[23:52:33] <Cork> trampi: you could give http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/ a try
[23:52:41] <Cork> or just use regexp
[23:52:48] <trampi> Cork: Thank you, i'll have a look into it.
