[05:34:58] <spoonUltra> I'm trying to learn Javascript, and I feel like there's a smarter way of writing this using an iterator, but I'm not sure how. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wGdorY
[06:59:06] <shoky> spoonUltra: the smarter way of writing this is with no js at all :P  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EKmWVO
[06:59:59] <spoonUltra> shoky Very smart.

[08:35:24] <printForever> Firebug console, how to print var that has been loaded via script?
[08:42:18] <spoonUltra> What's wrong with the submitHandler on this form validation? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zqwwYO?editors=0010
[09:53:19] <boom_> Hey guys I'm working with jQuery and I have this javascript function that updates the page every now and again. https://gist.github.com/boomtopper/0ed8c1a7ecdf80bbb33a
[09:53:35] <boom_> My problem is the <img> tags are caching.
[09:55:03] <Xatenev> boom_: what do you mean by caching
[09:55:15] <Xatenev> when you replace the HTML, images are replaced too.
[09:56:35] <boom_> What happens is that code does a get for the page again and then selects the dom portion that is #vwdashboard and then puts it back inside itself. Within <section id="vwdashboard"> There are img tags and it is not updating the images.
[09:58:44] <taplar> seems like your after replaceWith
[09:59:20] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[10:00:07] <taplar> dest.replaceWith(data)
[10:22:19] <printForever> hello
[10:26:26] <taplar> aloha
[10:26:38] <printForever> taplar... I'm in a pickle...
[10:26:48] <printForever> I got a script working, everything is hunky dorry
[10:26:55] <printForever> but... the last element in the array
[10:27:00] <printForever> is not being used
[10:27:03] <printForever> at all
[10:27:06] <printForever> all of them work
[10:27:14] <printForever> from 0... until n-1
[10:27:25] <printForever> I don't know what seems to be the problem
[10:27:32] <printForever> did I switch object/array?
[10:27:35] <taplar> what's your script look like?
[10:28:28] <printForever> php outputs an UL LI list. I grab the list of elements, put them in the var and then on keyUp I update the input field with another list of the same elements that are styled
[10:30:10] <taplar> so it's something like a filter type thing?
[10:30:17] <printForever> exactly
[10:30:17] <taplar> well, filter/search
[10:30:38] <taplar> and each key up your getting the new search results
[10:31:23] <taplar> or is the list the complete list and your only doing a filter?
[10:31:52] <printForever> the problem is... where the hell is the last element?
[10:32:06] <printForever> why is it not being matched when searching
[10:32:15] <taplar> i'd have to see your logic
[10:32:29] <printForever> I checked the code, its in the code. I've checked the dom with jquery, the element is there...
[10:33:27] <printForever> how do I print(variable)
[10:33:32] <printForever> in the console?
[10:33:37] <taplar> console.log(variable)
[10:33:40] <printForever> ok
[10:33:42] <taplar> or console.table(variable)
[10:33:44] <printForever> lemme check this
[10:34:48] <rtd1123> this probably could have been solved 12 minutes ago with a pastebin of the script
[10:34:55] <taplar> :)
[10:35:09] <printForever> taplar, does each variable has to have $?
[10:35:20] <printForever> var results = [];     var $city = '';    var phrase = '';
[10:35:22] <taplar> no, $ isn't a requirement for variable names
[10:35:25] <decx> just show your code ffs
[10:35:33] <printForever> decx, noooooo
[10:35:45] <taplar> $ is just used to denote the value should be a jquery object already
[10:35:51] <taplar> it's just programmer styling
[10:40:09] <taplar> without seeing the logic all i can suggest is try change it from doing a for loop and try using each instead, to get away from the n access yourself.
[10:40:55] <Xatenev> decx: He wrote so good code that he cant show it, the best algorithm @world.
[10:41:11] <taplar> Xatenev: or it's the tribute
[10:41:32] <taplar> caaaaaan't remembeeeeer.... the greatest code in the world....no!  this is a tribute!!!
[10:57:16] <babadoo> how can i bind to load event of a dynamic created element with .on ?
[10:58:41] <taplar> sure
[11:00:04] <BillCriswell> @babadoo Event delegation is likely the better option there.
[11:00:06] <Xatenev> .on('click', function() { // element is dynamically created + Perform the load event here instead of creating a seperate listener });
[11:00:23] <taplar> load doesn't propagate out though
[11:01:18] <decx> image or iframe
[11:06:02] <disto> hello guys
[11:06:20] <taplar> hello linux variant
[11:06:34] <taplar> ah, missing an 'r', dang
[11:07:23] <rtd1123> still humorous, I'll accept it
[11:07:39] <disto> i have more than 1 li in a list. all have the same id. those li has numeric values. i wanna hide the particular ones less than 2. how to do it ?
[11:07:55] <taplar> don't use repetitivie ids
[11:07:58] <taplar> ids must be unique
[11:08:27] <taplar> you could change it to be a class
[11:08:34] <disto> or let's say class
[11:08:44] <disto> sorry for my mistake. i wanted to say class
[11:08:53] <taplar> ok, so what do you mean by numeric values
[11:09:00] <taplar> the inner html is a value?
[11:09:05] <disto> but when i try, they are all hidden if even one value is less than 2
[11:09:12] <disto> yes innter html
[11:09:36] <taplar> so you'd do a filter on your list of li's and return only those that have a value less than 2
[11:09:41] <taplar> and you'd hide those
[11:10:22] <disto> my knowledge is apperantly limited. and i couldn't find it on the web. could oyu please help me taplar ?
[11:10:33] <taplar> are you familiar with filter() ?
[11:10:51] <disto> yes a bit
[11:11:22] <taplar> so to get the elements you'd want to hide would be something like
[11:12:02] <taplar> myarray.filter(function() { return parseInt( this.innerHTML, 10 ) < 2; })
[11:12:07] <taplar> to get the elements you want to hide
[11:13:18] <babadoo> Xatenev: i need to insert an iframe in the dynamic created element, so the click function would not work. but the load event does not work with on, i guess
[11:13:42] <Xatenev> babadoo: It does.
[11:14:31] <Xatenev> $("dynamicCreatedElement").on('load', function() { insert iframe }
[11:29:02] <babadoo> Xatenev: i cannot get it working
[11:29:23] <Xatenev> babadoo: Prob gotta show some code.
[11:42:21] <Duikb00t> hi
[11:42:29] <taplar> bon jour
[11:42:35] <robertmaxrees> hola
[11:42:36] <Duikb00t> I have a small issue im generating a html table in the back-end which I have to store as a PDF all good all fine
[11:42:58] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/mewmnc/   This is what I am trying so far
[11:43:20] <Duikb00t> But I want to add a class like: td_1_1  where 1= line 1 data field 1
[11:43:30] <Duikb00t> So I can easy loop it in php to generate the PDF
[11:43:42] <taplar> it'd be better to use data fields most likely
[11:43:46] <Duikb00t> Whats the best way to add class for each row?
[11:43:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:44:16] <Duikb00t> ok but how should I add them?
[11:44:21] <Duikb00t> data-row="x"
[11:44:39] <taplar> if your doing straight html, yes
[11:44:59] <taplar> but if your generating the html in javascript it would be better to make a template that you load and modify
[11:45:09] <Duikb00t> Well it's all based on the pastery code.
[11:45:25] <Duikb00t> and it works but it's not handy this way to handle it in the back-end.
[11:45:47] <taplar> one sec...
[11:45:51] <Duikb00t> I think I should add to the tableData a 'data-src' or something
[11:47:10] <Duikb00t> This is the way how I receive it in the array in PHP >> https://www.pastery.net/tyvrzq/
[11:47:23] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to do this in PHP or JS?
[11:47:23] <babadoo> Xatenev: https://jsbin.com/finitahuwu/edit?html,js,output
[11:52:46] <Duikb00t> taplar:  So it should be a nice to generate a multi-dimensional array for each row with the data immo
[11:53:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:53:10] <robertmaxrees> welp
[11:53:47] <babadoo> Xatenev: i have added jquery as a lib (made a clone of the jsbin) : https://jsbin.com/pajecuceva/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[11:53:47] <Duikb00t> Me? Well I generate it in JS and pass it to PHP.
[11:53:56] <Duikb00t> robertmaxrees:  *
[11:55:40] <taplar> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/venmLats/
[11:56:03] <taplar> small example, but you can build things this way instead of having the html in your script files
[11:57:02] <Duikb00t> Ok so I should generate my input fields also based on that ?
[11:57:23] <taplar> i'd think so
[11:57:39] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/venmLats/1/
[11:58:29] <Duikb00t> The thing is the table has been generated form a select box on the fly
[11:58:38] <Duikb00t> So I can select how many row and cols I want
[12:00:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/venmLats/2/
[12:01:43] <taplar> course in your case you won't be doing a for each, but an each over the results you want to build.  in some fashion
[12:03:58] <babadoo> Xatenev: the load event does not seem to work with ".on"
[12:04:34] <Whiskey-> is it possible to track what link i clicked on? https://jsfiddle.net/0dh2x9Ln/
[12:05:07] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey-
[12:05:09] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:05:17] <Whiskey-> i know about the dubble
[12:05:20] <robertmaxrees> the docs tell you that $(this) is the thing that emitted the event.
[12:05:33] <Whiskey-> hmm i missed that part
[12:06:17] <Whiskey-> exactly what doc page?
[12:07:12] <robertmaxrees> weird - the docs for .on() mention it, which .click() uses that under the hood.
[12:07:15] <taplar> babadoo: from your jsbin earlier it looks like your trying to bind load to a div
[12:07:17] <Whiskey-> i only get this not defined
[12:07:49] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey ah, you want the child linkt hat was clicked?  use a delegated listener instead.
[12:08:07] <decx> e.target is what you clicked
[12:08:21] <Xatenev> robertmaxrees: $(".Links").click(function(e){console.log($(e.target).html());e.preventDefault();});
[12:08:32] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you're telling me/.
[12:08:41] <babadoo> taplar: yes i want the handler to execute, when the div is dynamically created
[12:08:41] <Whiskey-> :P
[12:08:41] <robertmaxrees> and i'd still use a delegated listener there ;)
[12:08:50] <taplar> babadoo: div's don't have a load event
[12:08:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/0dh2x9Ln/3/
[12:08:59] <Whiskey-> yeh i try to add it to my analytics software for some statistic then its need to know what link that was hitted
[12:09:02] <taplar> windows, iframes, images do
[12:09:05] <decx> you could argue that's it's already delegated by being on the parent ^^
[12:09:34] <robertmaxrees> decx you're using the bubbling of the event, sure, but why not just make things easier for yourself and much clearer by using the delegated syntax?
[12:10:00] <decx> well sure it's just qol
[12:10:01] <Xatenev> robertmaxrees: ooops, I meant @Whiskey
[12:10:04] <Xatenev> robertmaxrees: sorry.
[12:10:10] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[12:13:25] <babadoo> taplar: so how can i add an iframe to a dynamically create something? is there another event like "ready" which i could try to bind to, or another element i could use, which has a load event?
[12:14:16] <Xatenev> babadoo: I think youre trying it wrong
[12:14:28] <Xatenev> babadoo: why dont you just add the iframe at the same place where you add your "dynamically create something"
[12:15:18] <taplar> ^
[12:15:38] <babadoo> Xatenev: because i dont know before how the place looks. think about it like a service which i want to let others plug into a page by adding a div_with_a_class_something.
[12:16:20] <Whiskey-> not sure i fallow
[12:16:25] <Whiskey-> maybe just give them an id
[12:16:30] <Whiskey-> i need to know what link that is hitted
[12:16:39] <Xatenev> Whiskey- We just told you
[12:16:49] <Xatenev> Whiskey-: you even got a link with a working example :O
[12:17:03] <Xatenev> (17:09:13) robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/0dh2x9Ln/3/
[12:18:11] <Whiskey-> something like $(this).html(href)
[12:18:39] <babadoo> so the usecase is: just add a <div class="myservice"> into a page (even multuple times at different places) and the js will convert it into an iframe (with dynamic id for resizing purposes)
[12:19:18] <taplar> babadoo: something like that would have to incorporate either an observer, which is not widely supported, or some form of polling
[12:19:33] <taplar> afaik
[12:19:50] <babadoo> why it needs an observer?
[12:20:03] <taplar> because creating a dom element doesn't have an event
[12:20:21] <taplar> it just happens
[12:20:27] <Whiskey-> Xatm strange i can´t see it
[12:20:37] <Xatenev> Whiskey-: the color changse
[12:20:44] <Xatenev> Whiskey-: of the link, into red
[12:21:09] <Xatenev> Whiskey-: https://jsfiddle.net/0dh2x9Ln/4/
[12:21:12] <taplar> i don't think it's a bad assumption to make the users add their element and then tell your service to change it
[12:21:14] <Whiskey-> yeh i know
[12:21:19] <taplar> tons of plugins do that
[12:21:21] <Whiskey-> but how do i get it in to a variable
[12:21:32] <Xatenev> var yourVariable = $(this).html()
[12:21:33] <Xatenev> xD?
[12:21:46] <decx> fake fluid dynamics from mouesmove with minimal math http://jsfiddle.net/decx/hzbc1Lcs/
[12:22:04] <Xatenev> decx: you just did that?
[12:22:15] <decx> well i did it a few days ago
[12:22:23] <Xatenev> decx: cool stuff
[12:22:26] <Xatenev> decx: something for codepen! :P
[12:22:58] <decx> i dont like codepens layout
[12:23:11] <decx> or the fact that they didnt go with the iceland tld
[12:23:11] <Xatenev> I cant do cool forntend stuff =( xd
[12:23:17] <Whiskey-> hmm strange as that return link name and not link
[12:23:28] <Xatenev> Whiskey-: thats not strange
[12:23:38] <taplar> my frontend is small.  i can only do certain things with it
[12:23:43] <Xatenev> Whiskey-: https://jsfiddle.net/0dh2x9Ln/5/
[12:24:16] <Whiskey-> https://jsfiddle.net/0dh2x9Ln/6/
[12:24:22] <Whiskey-> yeh there you go to :D
[12:24:33] <Whiskey-> :) thanks
[12:24:37] <Whiskey-> but i found it out two :D
[12:24:44] <Xatenev> good job :)
[12:25:03] <Whiskey-> :)
[12:38:19] <AL13N_work> how can i run a function, but only after every other ready() thing has run?
[12:38:36] <taplar> put it at the bottom?
[12:38:49] <AL13N_work> after the </html> tag?
[12:38:50] <taplar> what do you mean?
[12:39:00] <taplar> do you have multiple ready functions?
[12:39:03] <AL13N_work> yes
[12:39:05] <AL13N_work> too much
[12:39:12] <taplar> why not combine them?
[12:39:24] <AL13N_work> it's not all my code
[12:39:35] <Sllollaryee> is find() better than just using #example .item?
[12:39:37] <AL13N_work> and it's gonna take a lot of time to do that
[12:40:05] <AL13N_work> it would definately be better to have the ready() stuff combine
[12:40:08] <AL13N_work> *combined
[12:40:11] <decx> it'll give you a few nanoseconds
[12:40:12] <AL13N_work> but ...
[12:40:46] <taplar> not sure then how jquery does the ordering of ready functions then
[12:40:53] * AL13N_work neither
[12:41:15] <AL13N_work> i was hoping to find out here :-)
[12:41:34] <taplar> someone else may know. i'd have to dig in the source to explore
[12:42:07] <taplar> ah, i'm thinking it does matter
[12:42:13] <taplar> i think you can put it last
[12:42:25] <taplar> looks like ready() just adds it as a done on the ready deferred
[12:42:38] <taplar> *promise
[12:42:45] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=$.fn.ready
[12:42:46] <decx> ie8 has it inversed
[12:42:47] <AL13N_work> heh
[12:42:54] <taplar> really?
[12:42:55] <taplar> :s
[12:42:59] <decx> what you attach last gets executed first
[12:43:01] <AL13N_work> decx: really?
[12:43:07] <decx> every other browser is juts abcd
[12:43:20] <AL13N_work> decx: what ie versions?
[12:43:26] <AL13N_work> just 8?
[12:43:28] <decx> <= 9
[12:43:30] <decx> <= 8
[12:43:33] <AL13N_work> then fuck it
[12:43:39] <decx> yep
[12:43:47] <AL13N_work> actually, why would i even care about ie in the first place
[12:43:58] <taplar> user coverage
[12:44:04] <decx> that's why i like progressive enhancement
[12:44:06] <AL13N_work> btw: can i add it AFTER </html> or does it need to be before?
[12:44:28] <taplar> not sure, but it should be inside body or head
[12:44:33] <decx> has to be in body or head
[12:44:45] <Sllollaryee> jquery documentation states
[12:44:48] <Sllollaryee> before </body>
[12:44:48] <AL13N_work> k
[12:45:01] <Sllollaryee> make sure to import jquery before your own js file
[12:45:16] <AL13N_work> ...
[12:45:46] <AL13N_work> if i add it at the very end... how could i not have jquery before it?
[12:46:01] <Sllollaryee> just saying what it being said in the jquery documentation sir
[12:46:07] <AL13N_work> ko
[12:46:09] <AL13N_work> *ok
[12:46:12] <AL13N_work> thankee sai
[12:46:27] <decx> maybe it was dependent of a module that pads strings
[12:46:35] <decx> topical!
[12:57:18] <taplar> anyone know a better way of doing this? https://jsfiddle.net/zzkejb28/
[12:58:54] <AL13N_work> is there a way to have an event when the location changes?
[12:59:02] <AL13N_work> (ie: to stop it from changing?)
[12:59:22] <taplar> you mean from a link?
[12:59:40] <AL13N_work> amongst others, yes
[12:59:46] <AL13N_work> buttons, submits, links, etc...
[12:59:50] <AL13N_work> whatever changes location
[13:00:08] <taplar> typically you don't want to stop location change globally.  users can leave your page, :)
[13:00:09] <AL13N_work> i want to put a warning: you haven't saved your stuff
[13:00:46] <taplar> there's an unload event you can use.
[13:01:00] <AL13N_work> unload? on Document? or ?
[13:01:08] <AL13N_work> body?
[13:01:13] <taplar> document or window i think
[13:01:15] * taplar googles
[13:01:23] <AL13N_work> k, thx
[13:01:27] <AL13N_work> i'll find it
[13:01:40] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/unload
[13:02:57] <AL13N_work> It is not possible to cancel the unload event with .preventDefault().
[13:03:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:03:12] <AL13N_work> https://api.jquery.com/unload/
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> that would allow you to effectively prevent the user from ever closing their browser.
[13:03:23] <AL13N_work> right
[13:03:37] <AL13N_work> robertmaxrees: but, how can i warn the user that his stuff is unsaved?

[13:04:59] <taplar> decx: i didn't see any media queries for handling zoom
[13:05:06] <AL13N_work> thx
[13:05:36] <decx> why zoom
[13:05:56] <taplar> it hides the fixed header menu if the user zooms in so much
[13:07:21] <taplar> working on a basic layout for a mobile page: http://ddoplanner.taplar.com/   scrolling up and down toggles visibility and zooming in hides it if it takes up too much space
[13:08:34] <decx> i think that pattern is called quick return

[14:03:47] <Lewix> hi
[14:03:50] <Lewix> http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_ref_js_collapse_events&stacked=h
[14:04:00] <Lewix> do you know if show.bs.collapse bubble up?
[14:04:08] <Lewix> when i listen to body it does get it
[14:04:27] <Uhkis> carefully step away from that site
[14:05:06] <Sllollaryee> that site has improved a lot
[14:05:17] <robertmaxrees> still not a good resource.
[14:05:28] <robertmaxrees> check out the bootstrap docs and mdn.
[14:05:35] <Sllollaryee> just saying that most ill-speaking articles are outdated at the moment
[14:05:54] <robertmaxrees> http://www.w3fools.com/ this is still pretty relevant.
[14:06:35] <Sllollaryee> it doesnt state much though
[14:06:41] <Sllollaryee> it gives a few other good resources
[14:06:48] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[14:07:12] <robertmaxrees> why reference anything but the bootstrap docs if you want info on bootstrap?
[14:07:29] <Sllollaryee> that could be said about anything on their site
[14:07:34] <robertmaxrees> eeexactly.
[14:07:39] <Gnjurac> hi i added this to my function
[14:07:40] <Gnjurac> $("#contact-form > form").trigger('reset');
[14:07:42] <Sllollaryee> main reason would be the examples I suppose
[14:07:47] <Gnjurac> but it dosent clear my form
[14:08:05] <taplar> isn't reset a function?
[14:08:09] <taplar> off of the Element
[14:08:11] <Sllollaryee> and for beginners their content is quite easy to read
[14:08:26] <robertmaxrees> Sllollaryee still seems terribly silly since the bootstrap docs contain examples, too.
[14:08:53] <Sllollaryee> I havent checked out bootstrap yet, really
[14:09:10] <Sllollaryee> and I do prefer the original documentation, dont worry
[14:09:16] <Uhkis> that's how they get you ;)
[14:09:23] <Gnjurac> sorry i am really noob only jquery i did is for ajax for my conatact form but can it call other functions from other ones like in all other programing lanuges
[14:09:29] <robertmaxrees> they're tyring to get you to buy stuff :)
[14:09:33] <Sllollaryee> Im just saying I agree with what w3fools says
[14:09:36] <taplar> if you want to know if something bubbles, why not try a delegate around it and see...
[14:09:41] <Sllollaryee> It used to be utter crap but its become better
[14:10:10] <Gnjurac> ok got it wokring by refreshing whole form insted just part of it
[14:10:33] <robertmaxrees> Sllollaryee I'd still advocate that people avoid it.  that's all.
[14:11:25] <Sllollaryee> youre right
[14:13:40] <Lewix> any idea how to inspect that an event from a third party lib is being sent?
[14:14:01] <Lewix> or console.log all the events?
[14:14:15] <taplar> attach a listener and console log the event
[14:14:18] <Lewix> without touching the code
[14:14:27] <Lewix> of the third party lib
[14:16:25] <decx> $._data(elem, 'events')
[14:16:41] <decx> not a jquery obj but the element itself
[14:18:15] <taplar> wouldn't show those done outside of jq, right?
[14:19:07] <decx> no idea
[14:19:27] <taplar> pretty sure it won't
[14:20:19] <`r3ply> hello.. I am trying to get my bootstrap carousel to add the 'active' class on some other elements on the page when the slide changes without any luck... i believe my function is getting the slide id numbers but suspect my code to remove and apply the 'active' class on other objects is not working.
[14:21:42] <`r3ply> its either that, or my code to the slide.bs.carousel is not working, anyone want to take a look and see if they can make it work?
[14:23:18] <robertmaxrees> setup a fiddle :)
[14:39:00] <`r3ply> here is my quite broken fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/sku6bnpn/
[14:40:01] <decx> connectivity isnt a made up word?
[14:40:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:40:54] <decx> like somebody who is personable, he's got that connectitude
[14:40:59] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:44:18] <`r3ply> here is a slightly working example of my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/9pjvkp1r/
[15:03:36] <`r3ply> anyone want to take a crack at fixing my fiddle? I'm trying to have a bootstrap carousel add and remove the 'active' class to other elements on the page.
[15:03:40] <`r3ply> Thanks.
[15:04:10] <robertmaxrees> how are you relationg those other elements to the carousel?
[15:04:15] <robertmaxrees> kind of lost about your question.
[15:04:50] <`r3ply> https://jsfiddle.net/9pjvkp1r/4/
[15:04:57] <`r3ply> $('#slideshow').on('slide.bs.carousel', function (e) {
[15:04:58] <`r3ply>   var id = e.relatedTarget.id;
[15:05:47] <`r3ply> so im trying to get the current #slideshow relatedTarget.id, and then set and remove the 'active' class on other elements
[15:06:18] <robertmaxrees> e.relatedTarget is for mouse events
[15:08:40] <robertmaxrees> $(this) will be the current slide.
[15:08:56] <`r3ply> well then that would explain why its not working..
[15:15:35] <`r3ply>   var carouselData = $(this).data('bs.carousel');
[15:15:36] <`r3ply>   var id = carouselData.getItemIndex(carouselData.$element.find('.item.active'));
[15:15:44] <`r3ply> this worked for getting the id
[15:17:03] <robertmaxrees> isn't $(this) technically the current carousel slide?
[15:17:59] <robertmaxrees> ah i see now.
[15:18:22] <robertmaxrees> it's the carousel proper.  derp derp.
[15:21:47] <`r3ply> now that i have the ID... my switch (id) { case "0" //do something here} does not appear to do anything...
[15:22:03] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle.
[15:23:47] <`r3ply> here is latest fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/9pjvkp1r/5/
[15:26:17] <`r3ply> ahh got it,,
[15:26:44] <`r3ply> my switch was: case "1":   ...should simply be: case 1:
[16:21:37] <hellyeah> hey
[16:21:53] <hellyeah> one question i have
[16:23:17] <Lewix> hellyeah: hell yeah f right
[16:27:36] <taplar> gotta stop typing your question in white text.  we can't see them when you do that
[16:28:14] <hellyeah> who,
[16:28:16] <hellyeah> ?
[16:28:27] <hellyeah> i prepared fiddle
[16:28:30] <taplar> heh, just ask your question dude
[16:29:28] <hellyeah> i just want to add content of arr2 to arr1 like name: blah surname: blah smt: blah lieke that but i cannot do that can you give me some advice https://jsfiddle.net/uyro89kg/1/
[16:29:54] <hellyeah> hope you understand my question
[16:30:23] <taplar> $.extend(arr1[0], arr2[0])
[16:31:51] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:35:13] <hellyeah> yes
[16:35:16] <hellyeah> that was easy
[16:35:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:35:22] <hellyeah> i am confused
[16:36:33] <hellyeah> hmm sorry
[16:36:36] <hellyeah> i disconnected
[16:36:46] <hellyeah> acxtually my aim is kinda different
[16:37:15] <hellyeah> add arr2 to arr1 in 1 - 1 basis https://jsfiddle.net/uyro89kg/2/
[16:38:00] <taplar> so combine the elements by position?
[16:38:48] <hellyeah> yes
[16:38:54] <hellyeah> is it possible?
[16:39:06] <taplar> ok, so loop it and do the same thing with [0] replaced with [i]
[16:40:09] <hellyeah> loop both object?
[16:40:22] <taplar> no, you can get the second one with the index of your loop
[16:42:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:42:36] <hellyeah> what about this
[16:43:24] <hellyeah> same principle? https://jsfiddle.net/uyro89kg/3/
[16:43:48] <taplar> no
[16:45:05] <hellyeah> oke
[16:45:06] <hellyeah> y
[16:45:11] <hellyeah> actually it is my case
[16:45:13] <taplar> objects can't have repeating keys dude
[16:45:20] <hellyeah> ah
[16:45:22] <hellyeah> okey
[16:45:28] <hellyeah> i am sorry for that
[16:45:33] <hellyeah> i change it i didnt know that
[16:46:28] <hellyeah> how about this https://jsfiddle.net/uyro89kg/4/
[16:46:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/uyro89kg/5/
[16:48:06] <hellyeah> yeah i understand that thanks for this
[16:48:31] <hellyeah> what about object does not have equal length
[16:48:43] <hellyeah> let me thing
[16:48:44] <hellyeah> k
[16:48:45] <hellyeah> sec
[16:48:49] <taplar> why does the length of the object matter?
[16:48:52] <taplar> objects don't have length
[16:49:02] <taplar> arrays do
[16:49:57] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:49:59] <hellyeah> ic
[16:50:04] <hellyeah> what my point is
[16:50:31] <hellyeah> whatever arr2 become bigger i want to put arr2's content inside arr1 as position
[16:50:36] <hellyeah> 1-1
[16:50:48] <hellyeah> this only works arr1 === arr2
[16:50:59] <hellyeah> in my case arr2.length > arr1.length
[16:51:07] <taplar> so what do you think you should do?
[16:55:15] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:55:50] <hellyeah> i have to loop two arrays together
[16:56:10] <hellyeah> arr1[i] arr2[j]
[16:56:34] <taplar> why?
[16:56:44] <hellyeah> two nested loop then $.extend(arr1[i], arr2[j])
[16:56:47] <taplar> your really stuck on the double looping, :)
[16:56:54] <hellyeah> hm m
[16:57:15] <hellyeah> but i need index of arr1 right
[16:57:29] <hellyeah> arr[0], arr[1] etc.
[16:57:43] <taplar> sure
[16:58:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:58:20] <taplar> State what your trying to do
[16:58:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[17:00:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes this is my aim https://jsfiddle.net/uyro89kg/6/
[17:01:02] <hellyeah> it is really easy i am not still practical tho
[17:01:23] <taplar> that's not stating what your trying to do
[17:01:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[17:01:40] <taplar> say in plain language what your trying to do
[17:01:47] <hellyeah> let me try
[17:02:00] <taplar> I have ........., I want to ......
[17:02:38] <hellyeah> i have to put content of arr2 into arr1. I want to do that by position.
[17:02:48] <hellyeah> is it okey to say like that?
[17:02:49] <hellyeah> :)
[17:03:02] <taplar> "put content of ... in ..."
[17:03:04] <taplar> how?
[17:03:57] <hellyeah> hmm
[17:04:28] <hellyeah> first of all forEach an array and use that content and index in another array because they have same length.
[17:04:38] <taplar> plain language
[17:05:06] <taplar> I have two arrays containing objects.  I want to...
[17:06:20] <hellyeah> i have two arrays containing object i want to combine them according to their position. For that purppose, i will loop array1 and i will use its element and use index to get content of arr2 and merge them. I can do that because arr1 and arr2 has same length
[17:06:34] <hellyeah> better?
[17:06:55] <hellyeah> wow man my manage refuse to contact me
[17:07:13] <hellyeah> we havbe really distance and you are like teacher
[17:10:21] <taplar> I have two arrays.  For every element in the first array that has a corresponding element in the second array, I want to merge the second element into the first element.  Any elements in the second array that exceed the size of the first array should be added to the first array.
[17:13:09] <hellyeah> than k you taplar
[17:13:52] <taplar> always state what you want.  that will lead you to the logic
[17:13:58] <taplar> and also help you work out logic problems
[17:14:31] <hellyeah> first plain language you are saying
[17:16:02] <hellyeah> i understood
[17:21:26] <`r3ply> if i'm using a div lets say col-sm-8, is there a way to apply a background color which only fills part of the div without defining another grid item?
[17:21:56] <`r3ply> i tried using width: 50px but that shrinks col-sm-8 to 50px...
[17:25:40] <taplar> more of a ##css question
[17:37:35] <ngl> Hello. I wrote a web app and it works great with great use of KO and JQuery with Bootstrap. It has a standard fixed top nav bar with styled LI elements and click bindings on the elements. The binding works just fine, but it is so ugly loading the different tab-sections.
[17:37:56] <ngl> So, I am thinking an overlay and then go through and click each tab so the DOM loads.
[17:38:34] <ngl> But, I cannot seem to cause a click that triggers the binding using $("#myli").trigger("click");
[17:38:42] <ngl> Any suggestions?
[17:39:11] <taplar> have an example?
[17:39:18] <ngl> Sure
[17:41:57] <ngl> Well, this is going to take some time in jsfiddle actually. The nav is a template... and bindings are in models per tab.
[17:42:26] <taplar> what about an example page (don't stop with the fiddle though) ?
[17:47:47] <ngl> taplar: As with so many things in coding... all I had to do was to ask to finally have the lightbulb go off in my head. I DO trigger the click handler, but it silently fails because it relies on "event.target.name" and when using jquery to trigger click I guess you don't get the name prop!
[17:47:54] <ngl> Just logged it out.
[17:49:02] <ngl> So, I had to scope to the a link inside the LI with ID like so: $("#roles_navlink > a").trigger("click");
[17:49:07] <ngl> now fine. Thank you.
[17:49:10] <taplar> hmm
[17:49:13] <taplar> cool
[17:49:59] <ngl> Still kinda confusing because the click binding is ON the LI... but, whatever. I just need it to work :\
[17:50:14] <ngl> Small small sample:     <li data-bind="click: handleNavlinkClick, attr: { class: getClass('roles')}" id="roles_navlink"><a class="navlink" name="roles" href="#">Roles</a>     </li>
[17:52:12] <bigredradio> How do you active a dynamically created button? See my example: https://jsfiddle.net/yk72e8yc/1/
[17:52:33] <taplar> use a delegate instead
[17:52:36] <bigredradio> I recall using "live" in the past, but that was replaced with "on" but I can't get it to work.
[17:52:43] <taplar> otherwise your going to have to bind on the new elements created
[17:55:00] <bigredradio> taper, are you talking to me (in De Niro voice)
[17:55:10] <bigredradio> taplar
[17:55:11] <taplar> yeah
[17:55:38] <bigredradio> taper, what do you mean by using a delegate
[17:55:46] <bigredradio> taplar
[17:56:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/yk72e8yc/2/
[17:56:50] * bigredradio reading up on delegate
[17:57:06] <taplar> using on(event, selector, handler)
[17:57:18] <taplar> you allow the events from children to bubble up to a pre-existing parent
[17:57:34] <taplar> and let the selector in the on filter out if the handler should happen for that child
[17:57:46] <bigredradio> taplar, I see
[17:57:59] <taplar> since it relies on bubbled events, it doesn't matter when the children were created
[17:59:14] <bigredradio> taplar, thanks.
[18:14:22] <bearzx> clear
[18:14:38] <taplar> no heartbeat.  again!
[18:14:55] <bearzx> hello world
[18:16:19] <bearzx> hi guys
[18:16:32] <bearzx> no one's talking?
[18:16:53] <taplar> mostly just watching and waiting for questions, :)
[18:17:26] <bearzx> ok thanks! sorry I'm new here :)
[18:17:37] <taplar> it's cool
[18:18:59] <taplar> err, didn't mean to imply you shouldn't talk, if perhaps it came across that way
[18:20:45] <taplar> please excuse, if i come across rude, that's just me.  that's how a playa's got ta be.
[18:23:29] <bearzx> oh that's totally fine, I'm just pretty new here and am trying to learn the rules.
[18:24:16] <taplar> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#etiquette
[18:25:46] <bearzx> thanks taplar! :)
[18:47:01] <acidjazz> whats happening
[19:19:58] <cagmz> can I use a variable within contains? like this.lastAddedPhoneType = $(".dx-item-content.dx-list-item-content")[0].innerHTML; $(".dx-item-content.dx-list-item-content:contains(this.lastAddedPhoneType)")
[19:20:22] <robertmaxrees> string concatenation, yeah.
[19:20:33] <robertmaxrees> $(".dx-item-content.dx-list-item-content:contains(" + this.lastAddedPhoneType + ")")
[19:21:50] <cagmz> ah nice. is it better performance than creating an array of list-items, then using inArray() and checking to see if lastAddedPhoneType is in it?
[19:29:18] <acidjazz> that is long
[19:29:55] <YourManCJ> what is the syntax to do someting like this: $(this > ".class").dosomething(function(){})
[19:30:37] <YourManCJ> so is it possilble to use $(this) and css selctors together?
[19:31:21] <robertmaxrees> make a plugin.
[19:31:28] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just use .each()
[19:31:33] <shoky> think he wants .find()
[19:31:50] <shoky> or .children()
[19:32:05] <shoky> e.g. $(this).find("> .class").dosomething()
[19:32:19] <YourManCJ> gothca. Thank you very much
[19:32:52] <YourManCJ> works perfectly.
[19:32:54] <acidjazz> i dont think you need >
[19:32:57] <YourManCJ> again thanks guys
[19:33:01] <shoky> > is for direct children
[19:33:03] <acidjazz> find will start w/in the elements children
[19:33:08] <acidjazz> but i guess yea
[19:33:14] <shoky> totally different than without it
[19:33:27] <shoky> .find("> .class")  is same as .children(".class")
[19:33:27] <acidjazz> well if every class is generaly close to the same name
[19:33:39] <shoky> wha?
[19:34:06] <acidjazz> so if you use > and were only wanting immediate children
[19:34:12] <acidjazz> why are you using find and not just having that in the selector
[19:34:21] <acidjazz> find is for all the elements
[19:34:23] <acidjazz> find this somewhere in this
[19:34:25] <shoky> because you're running it on $(this)
[19:34:29] <shoky> $(this).find()
[19:34:39] <shoky> (for example)
[19:34:47] <acidjazz> i dont think you get my question
[19:34:52] <shoky> guess not
[19:34:58] <acidjazz> ist just more conceptual
[19:35:02] <acidjazz> you're right
[19:35:10] <acidjazz> im just thinking ok if you use >
[19:35:18] <acidjazz> how did you get to needing .find()
[19:35:37] <shoky> let's say i want all .foo elements that are children of $(this)
[19:35:49] <acidjazz> immediate
[19:35:50] <acidjazz> as in >
[19:35:55] <shoky> i mean descendants, sorry,
[19:36:00] <shoky> so.. $(this).find('.foo')
[19:36:05] <acidjazz> thats wehre i see find being used
[19:36:08] <shoky> then i decide i only want direct children
[19:36:11] <shoky> i add a >
[19:36:14] <acidjazz> but you did .find(' > .foo');
[19:36:16] <shoky> that's how ;p
[19:36:23] <acidjazz> so i wouldnt have gotten to $(this), i woulda > .foo beforehand
[19:36:26] <acidjazz> is my only point
[19:36:33] <shoky> beforehand? no idea what you mean
[19:36:48] <shoky> you're in a click handler
[19:36:53] <shoky> $(this) is the clicked element
[19:36:59] <shoky> you want stuff inside it
[20:58:52] <esmic> when i comparing input values with a json array. am i using a forloop to do that?
[21:14:43] <jasonMomoa> I tried console.table(variable) and console.log(variable) for trying to see what's inside the variable, but I'm getting thta "is not defined"
[21:15:04] <schemanic> Hi
[21:15:38] <schemanic> I've gotten an element var myElem = $("myElemId");
[21:16:30] <schemanic> If that element is a <select>, how can I get it's selected value based on my variable assignment?
[21:16:47] <schemanic> I want to do something like myElemSelected = myElem... something
[21:16:49] <shoky> .val()
[21:16:50] <schemanic> help?
[21:17:08] <jasonMomoa> val doesen't work either
[21:17:17] <shoky> i was talking to schemanic
[21:17:37] <schemanic> is .val() the value of the select at any given point in time?
[21:17:49] <shoky> it's the value of the select at the time you called it
[21:18:34] <schemanic> word
[21:19:02] <schemanic> I found $("#myElemId option:selected").text()
[21:19:16] <schemanic> but that left me a little confused if I wanted to assign those things differently
[21:19:17] <shoky> that's to get the selected option's text, not value
[21:19:33] <jasonMomoa> shoky, can you look at this
[21:19:52] <jasonMomoa> http://pastebin.com/w044NC0x
[21:20:05] <jasonMomoa> line 10 makes no sense
[21:20:20] <jasonMomoa> because after i++ and doing to loop, the i is recasted to 0
[21:20:25] <jasonMomoa> so... i++ has no point
[21:21:41] <shoky> jasonMomoa: huh?  the value of i is used inside the loop
[21:21:59] <jasonMomoa> yes, and its always incremented by one
[21:22:04] <shoky> the = 0  only happens when the loop starts, once
[21:22:06] <jasonMomoa> but at the start it always go backs to 0
[21:22:11] <shoky> no, it doesn't :)
[21:22:19] <jasonMomoa> ok, my bad
[21:22:30] <jasonMomoa> problem is, the search does not return the last element
[21:22:32] <shoky> btw that loop will not find the last element
[21:22:34] <shoky> hah
[21:22:38] <jasonMomoa> hahaha
[21:22:40] <shoky> cause you have - 1
[21:22:41] <jasonMomoa> thats the thing
[21:22:43] <jasonMomoa> yes
[21:22:46] <jasonMomoa> I removed it
[21:22:51] <jasonMomoa> but it didnt help
[21:23:34] <shoky> you're doing  .html(array of strings) which is weird..
[21:23:43] <shoky> anyways make a jsfiddle if you want actual help
[21:23:45] <jasonMomoa> not my code
[21:23:54] <shoky> who cares
[21:24:16] <jasonMomoa> I removed -1, but still there is no last element
[21:24:16] <shoky> as far as i'm concerned it's yours :)
[21:24:30] <jasonMomoa> I had an idea to add +1
[21:24:32] <jasonMomoa> instead of -1
[21:24:33] <shoky> no.
[21:24:52] <shoky> removing the - 1 should work.  if you have a problem, show the problem in a jsfiddle
[21:24:53] <jasonMomoa> but it doesent do anythig as well
[21:24:56] <shoky> i can't help without seeing the problem
[21:25:20] <jasonMomoa> can you please explain to me the logic behind line 14
[21:25:32] <jasonMomoa> why is it > -1
[21:25:51] <jasonMomoa> why isn't just... doing it or > 0
[21:25:52] <shoky> did you read the docs for the .search method?
[21:25:58] <jasonMomoa> no
[21:25:59] <shoky> do you know what it returns?
[21:26:03] <jasonMomoa> no idea
[21:26:15] <shoky> then you should read it.
[21:26:19] <jasonMomoa> I agree
[21:26:21] <shoky> it tells you what it does, and what it returns :)
[21:26:27] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search
[21:27:00] <jasonMomoa> aaaaa I get it
[21:30:21] <jasonMomoa> still there is 1 element missing
[21:30:28] <jasonMomoa> is it because of array index 0
[21:30:49] <shoky>  if you have a problem, show the problem in a jsfiddle. we  can't help without seeing the problem
[21:31:11] <jasonMomoa> shoky, if you solve it for me
[21:31:17] <jasonMomoa> I wont learn jack $hit
[21:31:29] <shoky> i can't help without seeing the problem, whatever man
[21:31:46] <jasonMomoa> you've seen the main loop
[21:31:51] <shoky> loops work fine for me
[21:32:06] <jasonMomoa> I just want to know why does 1 element keep missing, the last one, just like you said
[21:32:21] <jasonMomoa> it might be because of array, since its 0...n-1
[21:32:33] <shoky> it should be 0..n-1
[21:32:58] <jasonMomoa> but, when he retrives the elements, they are just starting at 0
[21:33:02] <shoky> anyway, I DONT SEE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR CODE. make a jsfiddle. stop talking about your problem that nobody can see
[21:33:03] <jasonMomoa> the number should remain the same
[21:35:23] <jasonMomoa> shoky, why cant I see the variable output when I do (function ($) {  console.log($allCities)   console.log($allCities.length) })(jQuery);
[21:35:40] <robertmaxrees> what happens when you run that?
[21:35:40] <jasonMomoa> I can only see the variable output when I run entire code (from pastebin)
[21:35:48] <jasonMomoa> ReferenceError: $allCities is not defined
[21:35:49] <schemanic> does passing a value to .val() set the value of the element?
[21:35:57] <shoky> schemanic: yes
[21:36:01] <schemanic> whereas passing nothing gets the value?
[21:36:06] <robertmaxrees> schemanic yep.
[21:36:08] <shoky> yes, as the docs say
[21:36:10] <schemanic> k. Thanks
[21:36:17] <robertmaxrees> jasonMomoa because the variable is defined in another scope?
[21:36:34] <jasonMomoa> then... how can I access it?
[21:36:37] <jasonMomoa> is there a way?
[21:36:54] <robertmaxrees> you can't jump scopes.  you could attach it to another scope, or learn how to use your debugger.
[21:37:01] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com is  a solid guide.
[21:37:16] <jasonMomoa> I'm learning how to use FireBug console, and right now I'm not learning anything
[21:37:25] <jasonMomoa> I could attach it to another scope? how?
[21:37:29] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[21:37:30] <robertmaxrees> read this.
[21:37:33] <robertmaxrees> it's a good guide.
[21:37:36] <robertmaxrees> you'll learn a TOJN
[21:38:18] <jasonMomoa> I didn't want to go setting breakpoints
[21:38:20] <jasonMomoa> I know that...
[21:38:27] <jasonMomoa> I wanted to have console.log output
[21:38:43] <robertmaxrees> then you put the console.log() in the same scope as where you declare and use the var.
[21:40:28] <jasonMomoa> robertmaxrees, all I get is request
[21:40:31] <jasonMomoa> "request"
[21:40:40] <robertmaxrees> show us the problem you're having in a fiddle then.
[21:47:30] <robertmaxrees> looong day
[22:06:23] <jasonMomoa> ok
[22:06:26] <jasonMomoa> found the problem
[22:06:31] <jasonMomoa> grunt file was serving an old file
[22:06:39] <jasonMomoa> how do I update grunt?
[22:13:37] <jasonMomoa> couldn't bother finding it
[22:13:40] <jasonMomoa> did it manually
[22:13:43] <jasonMomoa> done and done
[22:13:50] <jasonMomoa> the first issue with -1
[22:14:06] <jasonMomoa> that I've also removed, this morning, was the culprit
[22:14:16] <jasonMomoa> problem was... it was on 2 places at the same time
[22:14:25] <jasonMomoa> output.js and search.js
[22:14:32] <jasonMomoa> where output.js was the one used
[22:14:44] <jasonMomoa> anyway, thanks guys!
[22:14:49] <jasonMomoa> good night
[23:48:20] <spoonUltra> Do you have to mention every form input in a fieldset for a .validate() to be valid?
[23:51:12] <Croug> hello, I've injected a couple of input boxes into a div using JQuery called ans1 and val1
[23:51:20] <Croug> but I can't seem to retrieve the value from them
[23:51:29] <Croug> this code here: alert($('ans1').value + ":" + toString($('val1').value));
[23:51:59] <Croug> gives results in "underfined:undefined"
[23:52:18] <Croug> or this code here rather: alert($('ans1').value + ":" + $('val1').value);
