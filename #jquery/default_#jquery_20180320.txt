[01:19:34] <muley> does jquery < 1.12 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability with "location.host" ?
[01:19:47] <muley> a client reported this from a security scanner: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/106657
[01:20:26] <muley> but i can't find much info about the vulnerability
[01:23:46] <muley> i mostly want to tell them it's a false alarm because we don't use "location.host" as a selector, but if it's a jquery internal issue, i can't ignore it :<
[01:24:45] <Woet> muley: the CVE has more info, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-9251
[01:26:07] <muley> ty. i'll go through this info. at a glance, it appears to only be an issue with cross-domain ajax, which i don't do
[01:26:08] <Woet> and https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2432
[01:27:24] <muley> thanks yeah this does not affect my website. i know i need to upgrade, but have other priorities at the moment. so this is a relief :)
[01:27:24] <muley> thanks
[02:04:12] <Cork> muley: it isn't just cross site
[02:04:51] <Cork> muley: but the likelyhood that a resource changes the content-type header for your own server without the server being seriously compromised is quite unlikely
[02:18:03] <muley> lol. right...
[02:18:29] <muley> like the hacker didn't get enough enjoyment in her first hack, so she hacked me again from the inside xD
[05:27:54] <Popzi> https://bpaste.net/show/7eb40a38a6db I can't figure out for the life of me what the URL this <a> tag is pointing to because of this magical jqeury, searched everywhere in firefox debugger to look where it's pointing to and can't find jack :| any ideas on what it's doing?
[05:29:13] <thykka> Popzi, it's not pointing to any url?
[05:29:30] <Popzi> thykka: EXACTLY. But when you click it, it downloads a file
[05:29:41] <thykka> it's inside a <form>?
[05:29:46] <thykka> does the form have an action?
[05:29:54] <Cork> it loads a new tab and most likely executes a script
[05:30:30] <Cork> it is perfectly possible to generate csv files in javascript
[05:30:37] <Popzi> right, I'll look at form and the new tab code, from the download file i can see it downloaded from https://website.com/campaign_processes/generate_campaign_report , so this is useful :-)
[05:31:57] <Popzi> well, the new window is completely empty
[05:32:35] <Popzi> and there's no <form> tag lol
[05:42:01] <thykka> then this cannot work: $("#campaign_report_export_csv_form").submit()
[05:44:58] <Cork> thykka: it cant?
[05:45:05] <Cork> why do you say that?
[05:45:21] <Cork> that just triggers the submit event on the form
[05:45:41] <thykka> keywords: "on the form"
[05:45:52] <Cork> ya, and?
[05:46:01] <thykka> a form must exist for that trigger to work?
[05:46:02] <Cork> didn't say "in the new tab"
[05:46:05] <thykka> wth
[05:46:11] <Cork> sure
[05:46:21] <Cork> or at least an id with the name
[05:46:33] <Cork> *that name*
[05:47:41] <thykka> only forms react to a submit event
[05:48:03] <Cork> only forms have a default submit action
[05:48:18] <Cork> not the same thing :)
[05:48:20] <thykka> or any submit action, for that matter
[05:49:14] <Cork> thykka: https://jsfiddle.net/0rowrkkv/
[05:51:07] <Cork> and yes, that is not someone should do, but when trying to break down someones else code, you should never expect them do to the correct thing
[05:52:55] <thykka> the event can be triggered through any element, but only a form would react to it with a POST/GET, no?
[05:53:08] <Cork> default action ya
[05:53:15] <thykka> like, if you had wrapped thad div within a form, the event would bubble through
[05:53:26] <Cork> but you can build content on a new tab from js
[05:53:34] <Cork> or you can ajax load content into it
[05:53:48] <Cork> or change the url or... a hundred other ors :)
[05:53:57] <thykka> right
[07:39:21] <harshalofic> hey i am using ajax to fetch data from database which are stored first in php file, but I'm unable to print that json object at front end
[07:40:24] <harshalofic> hey i am using ajax to fetch data from database which are stored first in php file, but I'm unable to print that json object at front end
[07:41:47] <harshalofic> hey i am using ajax to fetch data from database which are stored first in php file, but I'm unable to print that json object at front end
[07:41:58] <harshalofic> someone there to help
[07:42:00] <harshalofic> ?
[07:44:11] <AdamPDotty> Someone here not to spam?
[07:44:13] <thykka> impatient much?
[08:03:03] <Cork> web/freenode tend to be a dead rinnger
[08:03:13] <Cork> ringer even .)
[08:19:24] <guino> If i click "OK" it will add "low" to the text adress . BUT how to stop make it repeatly when I click OK --> https://jsfiddle.net/b8wLq6ku/13/
[08:21:28] <Cork> guino: two options, check if the value exists in the url
[08:22:07] <Cork> or do something like .replace(/\/dir\/map/, '/dir/low/map')
[08:23:17] <guino> Cork: can you make an example of my jsfiddle of .replace function. I have tried the replace function but it never do it right
[08:23:42] <Cork> i gave you the exact call there
[08:24:14] <guino> Cork: ok, I will try :)
[08:28:00] <guino> Cork: didnt work for me --> https://jsfiddle.net/b8wLq6ku/20/
[08:28:22] <Cork> you need to store the result
[08:28:33] <Cork> currently you modify the value from text() and then throw it away
[08:29:14] <guino> oh like this --> https://jsfiddle.net/b8wLq6ku/23/
[08:29:19] <guino> thank u
[08:29:49] <Cork> np
[08:36:53] <lilalinux> Is it possible with jquery only (no extensions) to react on attribute changes?
[08:37:08] <Cork> no
[08:37:21] <lilalinux> thank you
[08:37:34] <Cork> you can with ModificationObservers though but that is messy and native js
[08:37:52] <Cork> (i recommend having the one changing it tell the ones caring instead of monitoring the dom)
[08:39:44] <lilalinux> I'm trying to inject something, have no control over the source
[10:33:37] <catbadger> So I've got this class that manages stacks of $.Deffered's... for some reason, it's losing track of the callbacks for single deferred objects... https://jsfiddle.net/ama6pfbh/4/
[10:34:23] <catbadger> https://jsfiddle.net/ama6pfbh/5/
[10:35:19] <catbadger> been staring at this thing for 2 days now
[10:36:11] <catbadger> anyone bored/
[10:36:12] <catbadger> ?
[13:46:17] <thedog3catch3r> I'm creating a table dynamically using JavaScript. When I try to read or modify a td by id, I don't get a value back/nothing happens. what am I doing wrong?
[13:47:03] <robertmaxrees> no idea :)
[13:47:06] <robertmaxrees> would need to see some code.
[13:47:30] <robertmaxrees> mind tossing a test case on jsfiddle?
[13:55:26] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[13:56:45] <thedog3catch3r> It's probably just a typo somewhere, as the logic checks out. I'll keep looking.
[13:57:05] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:57:06] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:04:16] <thedog3catch3r> robertmaxrees: So it's a problem with my id name. I had periods in there, and that broke it. I thought periods were valid in ids?
[14:04:40] <thedog3catch3r> ahh, need escapes
[14:06:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:06:27] <robertmaxrees> periods are *technically* valid /in html/
[14:06:42] <robertmaxrees> but the moment you want to select things using css/js you're gonna have problem.
[14:21:37] <z1haze> do delegated event listeners have extra overhead that normal event listeners do not?
[14:21:50] <taplar> a little bit
[14:22:02] <taplar> as they have to perform the child filter against the elements
[14:22:14] <z1haze> its tiny though, generally?
[14:22:25] <taplar> i would say it's not noticable usually
[14:22:44] <z1haze> im trying to decide if i should rebind event listeners after new content is inserted or just use a delegated listener and be done
[14:22:48] <taplar> but you should delegate bind as low as possible
[14:23:29] <z1haze> heh, so body probably not best choice :D
[14:23:33] <taplar> nope
[14:23:44] <z1haze> i dont think I have a choice in this case, but I understand what you're getting at
[14:23:45] <taplar> because all events that bubble will go through body
[14:26:24] <catbadger> ugh
[14:29:57] <taplar> catbadger i was looking at your logic a bit earlier
[14:30:23] <taplar> after some testing i was getting an error with some of the var thing = otherThing = obj.something  lines
[14:30:28] <taplar> since the middle thing was not defined
[17:21:15] <rorro> I am currently using this code to send form data to my server https://pastebin.com/XLncQpmQ
[17:21:47] <rorro> How can I edit/use/manipulate the data from the form before sending it to the server?
[17:22:23] <robnertmaxrees> depends.
[17:22:30] <robnertmaxrees> how do you want to manipulate it?
[17:22:51] <rorro> I want to send the data into a function and then send that returned data to the server instead
[17:23:43] <robertmaxrees> var myData = $(this).serialize();
[17:23:45] <robertmaxrees> then edit.
[17:25:02] <robertmaxrees> what are you looking to modify?
[17:25:15] <robertmaxrees> like, any reason the server can't handle that part for you?
[17:32:12] <rorro> I already have the function written and in use in the client. It would be more efficient to reuse that function.
[17:32:33] <robertmaxrees> heh./
[17:32:36] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[17:40:57] <taplar> i'm confused
[17:41:30] <taplar> was that last statement a "nvm" statement?
[17:41:46] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[17:41:58] <robertmaxrees> i've largely given up trying to encourage people to do "the right thing" in a lot of cases.
[17:42:52] <taplar> oh, i wasn't meaning your statement if that's what you thought
[17:43:01] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[17:43:09] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[17:47:25] <rorro> My statement?
[17:47:33] <taplar> yep
[17:48:16] <rorro> I don't understand what you mean with nvm statement.
[17:48:40] <taplar> I don't see how your "I already have..." statement relates to your desired changes statement
[17:50:11] <rorro> What I meant was that I have a function written that the client uses for other purposes, but wanted to use again.
[17:50:24] <rorro> Either I'm really slow or I am just too stupid to understand what you mean :/
[17:52:15] <taplar> So, what's the next step?  robert mentioned some things you can do.
[17:53:21] <rorro> Oh. I am currently working on it. It works as I wanted, just testing that everything works after the post. I'll post my updated code.
[17:53:34] <taplar> k
[17:55:44] <rorro> Here is a working version that I currently have https://pastebin.com/mzrUCRDS
[17:55:54] <rorro> Thanks for the help robertmaxrees
[17:56:34] <taplar> small note, line 13 and 15, you don't have to wrap button in $().  it's already a jquery object
[17:56:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:56:58] <robertmaxrees> also: what's up with the setTimeout?
[17:57:04] <robertmaxrees> whjy not just put that in the callback?
[18:00:54] <taplar> i also feel like the serialize isn't the best approach here
[18:01:25] <taplar> the two things you are trying to get should be targetable with selectors
[18:01:41] <taplar> rather than breaking down the param string
[18:01:58] <taplar> it's also highly unreadable what is actually happening
[19:26:56] <benwas> Hello everyone, I'm benwas and I'm new to IRC. Hoping to meet some like-minded developers to learn from and hopefully teach as well!
[19:37:09] <robertmaxrees> quiet day
[23:07:55] <_entropy> hey ok so... i have this bit of code... $("#screen").val(data)
[23:08:10] <_entropy> this works when the container is a textarea, how can i do it for <div>?
[23:25:19] <pavonia> _entropy: .text or .html, depending on what you want to set exactly
[23:37:58] <skypce> hi
[23:38:03] <skypce> I have this code
[23:38:49] <skypce> Can I paste here
[23:39:15] <skypce> i will research by myself better thanks
[23:43:14] <_entropy> how do i evaluate <b> in a div to the actual html code?
[23:47:40] <pavonia> What does that mean?
[23:48:08] <pavonia> skypce: Use one of the pastebins mentioned in the topic
[23:49:44] <skypce> Thanks pavonia
[23:49:47] <skypce> It is very simle
[23:49:51] <skypce> Simple but do not work

[23:50:43] <skypce> I want move a div in a sibling level and  insert a image inside it
[23:50:48] <pavonia> _entropy: Did you use .html?
[23:50:57] <skypce> I am using jquery 2.4
[23:59:15] <pavonia> skypce: You should create a full fiddle example, that line of code doesn't look wrong to me by itself
