[00:06:10] <Ububegin> Clorith: yeah, just used the append method..
[00:06:46] <Stephen> Did you know the term "Appendable" does not appear in the dictionary?
[00:07:05] <Clorith> But appendectomy does!
[00:07:17] <Ububegin> Stephen: O_O
[00:07:41] <Stephen> LOL
[00:08:11] <TTomiK> I've attached Bootstrap typeahead to an input-element. Is there a way to get input's attributes somehow ?
[00:08:43] <Stephen> From what context?
[00:08:48] <Stephen> I mean, sure, always
[00:10:12] <TTomiK> Stephen: it's a dynamic form that allows the user to create more "rows" that includes typeahead
[00:10:17] <Stephen> I suppose you are trying to specifically get these attributes during preProcess or preDispatch?
[00:11:21] <TTomiK> I've got the typeahead's options in a single object that I can reuse when activating the typeaheads at the time user creates a new row
[00:11:23] <Stephen> TTomiK: I suppose I would need more specifics. Getting element attributes is easy. $(element).attr()
[00:11:58] <Stephen> if you've used data attributes, it's $(element).data("attributeName")
[00:12:34] <TTomiK> Stephen: I'll write it in pastebin so you can read the whole deal from there... just a moment
[00:12:41] <Stephen> thx
[00:18:33] <TTomiK> Stephen: is this any clearer: http://pastebin.com/gNZK0cUj ?
[00:19:22] <TTomiK> Stephen: source means the typeahead's source where you can define where the typeahead gets the suggestions
[00:19:54] <TTomiK> this could be something like $(this).closest('input.brand_model').val(), but this isn't of course defined
[00:20:49] <TTomiK> Stephen: $([this-is-what-I-am-after])... :)
[00:26:43] <Stephen> Looking
[00:28:01] <Ryan_> hey anyone around?
[00:28:14] <Stephen> Ok, where are you trying to get [this-is-what-I-am-after], TTomiK?
[00:28:19] <Stephen> Inside what method?
[00:29:00] <Stephen> Oh, source
[00:29:01] <Stephen> I see
[00:41:03] <Stephen> TTomiK: Here's the right way to do it: http://jsfiddle.net/rwF7T/3/
[00:41:07] <Stephen> cache the element
[00:45:53] <TTomiK> Stephen: sorry for the delay, I'll check it now
[00:46:00] <Cork> Stephen: uh, why don't you just use "this" there?
[00:47:00] <TTomiK> Stephen: there can't be ID:s in the inputs or they have to have some kind of random stuff in them, because there are multiple rows and row includes both inputs
[00:51:04] <TTomiK> Stephen: like http://jsfiddle.net/GgVSK/
[00:52:35] <TTomiK> I need to get my hands on the input.model_code the typeahead is attached to :) Then I can get the model_code's value with closest() (I think)
[01:02:06] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/rwF7T/11/
[01:02:08] <Stephen> TTomiK
[01:02:38] <Stephen> Swap out the parameters for what you need
[01:05:47] <PhaseCode> does anyone know how I would overlay an image on a div :T
[01:07:56] <Cork> PhaseCode: position: absolute?
[01:08:17] <Cork> make the div position: relative; and add a position: absolute element inside it
[01:08:35] <PhaseCode> Cork:
[01:08:38] <PhaseCode> I LOVE YOU MAN.
[01:09:20] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/rwF7T/12/
[01:09:58] <Stephen> PhaseCode: Don't forget div backgrounds either!
[01:10:00] <Stephen> TTomiK
[01:11:18] <PhaseCode> Stephen: I got that one :), its just so late and ugh 18 hours into a shift really makes me want to kill something.
[01:14:56] <Stephen> Understood
[01:19:25] <joobz> guys, is there a decent spellchecker for JQuery that suggests words as you type if they are wrong? i found a few but they seem to have a delay to them or require a click event to fire them, rather than after each word instantly underline if it's misspelt.........
[01:24:49] <Stephen> joobz: That's because trapping on only spaces when typing in an input box isn't the simplest thing
[01:25:30] <joobz> Stephen, is there nothing that handles it well?
[01:26:05] <Stephen> joobz: You'll want to hunt for something that uses textarea
[01:26:16] <Stephen> it's the only way to do it right
[01:27:09] <joobz> Stephen, i hunted, i found a few, but the only one i found that did it on the fly was one with delay..
[01:27:17] <joobz> got any at hand that work well, without delay on the fly?
[01:28:21] <PhaseCode> Hey Stephen: quick question my opacity is also does it to the image, any idea?
[01:31:02] <Stephen> joobz: The delay is for an ajax lookup. Unless you plan on loading the entire dictionary into memory, no.
[01:31:39] <Stephen> PhaseCode:When you change opacity, all child elements inherit that opacity
[01:32:04] <Stephen> So both backgrounds and overlays have the same problem
[01:32:25] <PhaseCode> Stephen: What's a workaround?
[01:33:48] <Stephen> PhaseCode: Place the whole thing in another 2 relative/absolute wrapper divs, then make the current child element a sibling. Set it's zIndex higher, and position it relatively
[01:34:08] <Stephen> (or absolutely, whichever fits you circumstance
[01:35:08] <Stephen> Make it a stack of cards as it were
[01:35:32] <PhaseCode> Wow thats confusing, if I throw my code up on jsbin can I have you take a look at it?
[01:35:37] <Stephen> Sure
[01:35:45] <PhaseCode> I hate to be such a noob asking but thanks so much for your help so far man!
[01:36:14] <Stephen> It's all good
[01:36:24] <PhaseCode> http://jsfiddle.net/e8mT7/
[01:36:33] <Stephen> I know you just learned about the absolute/relative wrapper div thing
[01:36:36] <Stephen> It's wierd
[01:36:48] <TTomiK> Stephen: ok, I'll take another look :)
[01:37:27] <PhaseCode> It's not that weird, I've been reading on it/its come up so much.
[01:37:44] <PhaseCode> See, I was supposed to be a C# developer, somehow ended up in PHP/HTML5/CSS land.
[01:38:26] <Stephen> Heh, yeah, I live in C# world too
[01:38:31] <Stephen> But I love JS
[01:38:45] <PhaseCode> Me too man!
[01:38:46] <Stephen> Anyway, so explain what you want this to look like
[01:39:31] <PhaseCode> So, the image overly is going to be set when I call an AJAX Method. So I need that mainContent div's text to have some lowered opacity, and the image to go over it to show that its loading.
[01:39:35] <Cork> PhaseCode: you want right bottom, not width height
[01:39:55] <Cork> top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0;
[01:41:49] <Stephen> PhaseCode: http://jsfiddle.net/e8mT7/1/
[01:41:51] <Stephen> There you are
[01:42:11] <Stephen> Turns out you just needed to use rgba() for your background color on overlay
[01:42:55] <Stephen> rgba is rbga(255,255,255,1)  params being (red,green,blue,opacity)
[01:43:24] <PhaseCode> Oh okay!
[01:43:32] <PhaseCode> Any idea why is that?
[01:43:47] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/e8mT7/2/
[01:44:07] <Stephen> Ok, so here's the explaination
[01:44:19] <Stephen> You wanted to lower the opacity of the text
[01:44:43] <PhaseCode> yea but opacity effects all child elements.
[01:44:50] <Stephen> Exactly
[01:44:56] <Stephen> so I removed the opacity change
[01:45:17] <Stephen> and instead used a color that lets you apply the opacity directly to the background-color
[01:45:20] <PhaseCode> Oh
[01:45:20] <PhaseCode> OH
[01:45:26] <PhaseCode> You set the background color of the overlay
[01:45:28] <PhaseCode> OH MY
[01:45:28] <Stephen> No child elements effected
[01:45:30] <Stephen> yes
[01:45:47] <PhaseCode> I swear, I'm like a kid sometimes.
[01:45:52] <Stephen> Nah
[01:46:01] <Stephen> Sometimes it just takes a second to step back
[01:46:34] <PhaseCode> Yea, I agree.
[01:46:41] <PhaseCode> Rubber Duck debugging man :)
[01:47:07] <Stephen> Do you use Firebug?
[01:47:22] <PhaseCode> I use chromes Elements/Styles viewer.
[01:47:40] <Stephen> good 'nuf
[01:48:27] <TTomiK> Stephen: your solution makes the options static after initialization, right?
[01:49:07] <Stephen> TTomiK: It does wrap them in a scope, yes
[01:49:26] <TTomiK> Stephen: I need the brand_model to be fetched every time the typeahead's source is accessed... in case the user changes the value in brand_model -field the model_code-typeahead needs to get the new value too
[01:49:44] <TTomiK> this is why I'd like to place the brand_model -call to source -code
[01:50:02] <PhaseCode> Stephen: You got skype?
[01:50:03] <Stephen> TTomiK: Then turn it into a closure
[01:50:37] <Stephen> TTomiK: That way you're passing along a scoped function to call
[01:50:53] <Stephen> PhaseCode: Yeah, but my wife is in bed, and it's 4am here
[01:51:17] <TTomiK> Stephen: I've never used closures :(
[01:51:34] <Stephen> TTomiK: One sec
[01:52:02] <TTomiK> so via closure I can access the input's attributes on $("input").typeahead() ?
[01:52:25] <TTomiK> that'd be awesome
[01:54:22] <Stephen> TTomiK: Link me what you have so far
[01:57:30] <Stephen> TTomiK: Corrrection: You are trying to turn a variable into a function
[01:57:56] <Stephen> The quick answer is you'll have to update the typeahead plugin code to make that sort of change
[01:59:40] <Stephen> It can technically be done with Object.defineProperty, but not all browsers support that yet
[02:00:25] <Stephen> You'd need to create a new object where the value is dynamically pulled from that element in the getter
[02:00:41] <Stephen> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty
[02:01:37] <TTomiK> Stephen: this is what I have so far: http://pastebin.com/ZGrRRsyc
[02:01:56] <TTomiK> Stephen: it's only missing the brand_model -value from the brand_model -field
[02:02:22] <TTomiK> Stephen: of course the var brand_model -row doesn't work now as there isn't any "$(this)"
[02:03:22] <Stephen> TTomiK: This is in an attempt to make the spellcheck control, right?
[02:03:40] <TTomiK> suggestions for something the user has started to write
[02:03:50] <TTomiK> ca -> suggest: carrot, car ...
[02:04:00] <TTomiK> just for an example
[02:07:18] <Stephen> TTomiK, can you link me to the plugin you are using?
[02:07:32] <TTomiK> it's twitter bootstrap typeahead, just a sec
[02:07:34] <Stephen> Because the way you are writing your code is very wrong
[02:07:48] <Stephen> he plugin has built-in ajax calls
[02:07:48] <TTomiK> ?
[02:08:08] <Stephen> You shouldn't need to do all this.
[02:08:23] <TTomiK> http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#typeahead
[02:08:46] <TTomiK> it has an option called source where you write where to get the data
[02:09:18] <TTomiK> so what's wrong ?
[02:11:01] <Stephen> Yes, but the plugin already gets the value of the input element it's on
[02:11:12] <Stephen> Why are you feeding it to it again?
[02:11:47] <Stephen> Oh, I see
[02:12:20] <Stephen> Wierd
[02:12:40] <TTomiK> I need to pass the brand_model -parameter to server :)
[02:13:17] <Stephen> So you don't care about the typeahead functionality, I imagine it already works
[02:13:26] <TTomiK> it works
[02:13:42] <Stephen> You're just trying to find a hook to the element to deliver brand_model?
[02:13:46] <TTomiK> yes
[02:13:56] <Stephen> Wow
[02:13:58] <Stephen> Dude,
[02:14:08] <TTomiK> $(this) (or something) to link to $("input.model_code") :)
[02:14:47] <Stephen> $("input[brand_model]").on("keyup", function() { this.dowhat you want; })
[02:14:49] <ooppa> Any of you guys know a jquery slider where I can update the content from php page after the content has scrolled or any way that I can mod that?
[02:15:01] <TTomiK> as you can see, I have options in a variable so I can reuse it when user makes a new row (the typeahead needs to be activated on the new row)
[02:15:24] <TTomiK> Stephen: what does that help ?
[02:15:52] <TTomiK> it's the model_code -field the typeahead is attached
[02:16:48] <TTomiK> Stephen: in the pastebin I posted a while ago, there's a row "var brand_model =..." This is where I should get the value of brand_model -field
[02:17:18] <Stephen> I know, but using these timeouts and all
[02:17:27] <Stephen> Eventually that's going to misfire
[02:17:50] <TTomiK> timeout is there because I don't want the suggestions to come immediately
[02:18:02] <Ooppa> Any of you guys know a jquery slider where I can update the content from php page after the content has scrolled or any way that I can mod that?
[02:18:09] <Stephen> So, you're basically making a cascading input bot
[02:18:12] <Stephen> am I right?
[02:18:41] <TTomiK> Stephen: I don't know what "input bot" means :)
[02:19:02] <Stephen> jquery slider, you're speaking about a control similar to a vertical or horizontal volume control, yes?
[02:19:15] <Stephen> sorry
[02:19:30] <Stephen> TTomiK: cascading text box
[02:19:33] <Stephen> type, dry
[02:19:38] <Stephen> sorry
[02:19:39] <Ooppa> Sec gonna link
[02:19:58] <yellowfish> free cat video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SF7G9UjVi0
[02:20:03] <Ooppa> Slider similar to this: http://www.awkwardgroup.com/sandbox/awkward-showcase-a-jquery-plugin/
[02:20:26] <TTomiK> Stephen: If I had a value "brown" in the brand_model box and typed "shi" in the model_code -box it would recommend brown shirts for example
[02:20:32] <Ooppa> Content and picture slider. I need the slider to dynamically update the content whitout loading the page.
[02:20:43] <TTomiK> Stephen... because the brown was passed to model_code's typeahead
[02:20:59] <DRWhite> hi all, I have an issue using the JQueryUI-Chart.
[02:21:24] <Ooppa> The data is coming from MySQL database and it is supposed to appear on TV screen. So it has to be fluid :S
[02:21:25] <DRWhite> When it writes the chart once it takes about 1 second to set and draw the graph
[02:21:38] <DRWhite> the second drawing with different data takes approximately 4 seconds
[02:21:45] <DRWhite> The third takes about 15 seconds.
[02:21:58] <DRWhite> the fourth takes minutes
[02:22:14] <DRWhite> Is there any easy way to get all this to be the right speed and only take moments?
[02:23:36] <DRWhite> does anyone have a resolution for this issue?
[02:25:43] <TTomiK> DRWhite: how are you drawing the charts? in a loop?
[02:25:45] <Stephen> Ooppa: Look for something like LightBox
[02:25:51] <Ooppa> LightBox
[02:25:56] <Stephen> It can do that sort of thing with IFrames
[02:26:14] <fat> why isn't my if statement not working? http://jsfiddle.net/qtRhQ/32/
[02:26:33] <Ooppa> Stephen: Does that work for content also and not only pictures?
[02:27:12] <Ooppa> Stephen: I want html not img :P (akward supports that)
[02:27:16] <Stephen> DRWhite: It sounds like you are running out of memory in the browser. Are you destroying the previous graphs/elements first?
[02:27:28] <DRWhite> There is a DATA set, then that data is placed into the SOURCE, then it is re-initiated
[02:27:30] <Stephen> Ooppa: yes
[02:27:32] <TTomiK> fat: value isn't "b"
[02:27:38] <TTomiK> fat: it's 1..3
[02:27:44] <DRWhite> It is a function that on button click it creates the chart
[02:27:51] <fat> TTomiK: oh
[02:27:58] <radditz> hello
[02:28:00] <DRWhite> All I do is change the data, and tell it to be the chart
[02:28:14] <Stephen> DRWhite: Then there is a memory leak in the control
[02:28:20] <radditz> I use a window.opener function that creates a popup, the problem is that it creates it on the original page instead on the popup window
[02:28:23] <DRWhite> so JQuery is faulty?
[02:28:29] <radditz> is there a way for jquery to add an element on the current page?
[02:28:33] <TTomiK> Stephen: the very simple question is: How to access the element that the typeahead is attached to from typeahead's code? :)
[02:28:36] <DRWhite> There is a Memory Leak in JQuery?
[02:29:04] <Stephen> DRWhite: could you post your code on jsfiddle.net?
[02:29:11] <Stephen> DRWhite: I'll take a look
[02:29:22] <Stephen> DRWhite: I highly doubt jquery is leaking
[02:29:39] <Ooppa> Stephen: I'm not sure if that one works for me :/ Or I don't get what you'd accomplish with that
[02:31:27] <TTomiK> fat: if you want it to check with the html, you need to change .val() to .html()
[02:31:50] <Stephen> TTomiK: And you have a solution. I understand now. It seems that instead typeahead should be allowing you to pass a second parameter into it's regular method of collecting the results. Going through all that to query back a scoped data result just seems silly.
[02:31:51] <fat> TTomiK: how do i make it echo the text instead of alerting it?
[02:31:54] <Stephen> But it definitely works
[02:32:03] <DRWhite> stephen, I just Queried you the code.
[02:33:29] <TTomiK> Stephen: what is the solution? wrapper? It can't pass parameters into $.ajax -call
[02:33:42] <TTomiK> fat: echo it where?
[02:33:49] <fat> TTomiK: in a div
[02:38:19] <fat> TTomiK: is it possible
[02:41:40] <TTomiK> fat: for example $("div#id").html(selected.html());
[02:42:30] <Stephen> DRWhite: You might try $("#Chart1").parent().append($("#Chart1").detach()).jqxChart(Chart1_settings))
[02:43:45] <fat> TTomiK: do i write <div id="?"></div> what should i make the ?
[02:44:26] <TTomiK> fat: <div id="test"></div> --> $("div#test")
[02:44:26] <Stephen> Ooppa: Give lightbox 3 iframes with the same url to scroll through
[02:44:52] <Stephen> Ooppa: Then just have PHP do the work of which one it's supposed to return that time
[02:45:05] <Stephen> essentially you're calling the same page over and over
[02:45:34] <Stephen> If it's on a TV, im guessing no need to go back
[02:46:17] <fat> TTomiK:  $("div#test").html(selected.html()); it doesn't echo anything.
[02:47:16] <Cork> sigh... don't add tag names infront of id's
[02:47:30] <Cork> (that should be added as a topic for this channel...)
[02:47:37] <Tingle> not having any luck in #css and #web, thought I might ask here, should I do my styleing like this: http://jsfiddle.net/3cpE9/2/ over the child selector, or give the elements inside the wrapper id's?
[02:48:29] <Stephen> TTomiK: The real solution is to give each one of the text boxes a single object as their source, and have an event onblur/select/change on the parent textbox which filters the child textbox's source.
[02:49:05] <Cork> Tingle: normally you don't need to child selector, if you remove that it becomes faster; other then that it should be fine like you have it
[02:49:25] <Stephen> Then let the plugin do it's work like it always does, it will just do so against a filtered list
[02:49:34] <Tingle> what do you mean I dont need the child selctor? how would you do what I just did?
[02:50:01] <Cork> Tingle: #page-wrapper > header becomes #page-wrapper header
[02:50:03] <Cork> for example
[02:50:40] <Tingle> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Writing_efficient_CSS says to avoid the descendant selector
[02:51:01] <Tingle> considering its the most expensive selector
[02:51:12] <Cork> Tingle: exactly
[02:51:31] <Stephen> Tingle: remove the div, give body an ID if you need it so bad
[02:52:14] <Stephen> But, be aware:
[02:52:26] <Tingle> mmm, body is more like a information layer, it has noscript, script and stuff in it, the div holds my page in the center
[02:52:35] <Tingle> which is the page
[02:52:38] <Stephen> Removing the child selector means that all children of #page-wrapper which are headers are styles
[02:52:41] <Stephen> styled
[02:52:49] <Stephen> it's recursive without the >
[02:52:50] <Cork> Tingle: that separation isn't needed
[02:53:25] <Tingle> so I should do body > header or just #page-header ?
[02:53:40] <Stephen> Tingle: Scripts should, when at all possible, go outside the body
[02:53:50] <Tingle> wat
[02:53:58] <Stephen> ID's are the fastest selectors
[02:54:15] <Tingle> you can put scripts outside of the body?
[02:54:18] <Tingle> inside the html tag?
[02:54:21] <Stephen> Yes
[02:54:24] <Tingle> o
[02:54:26] <Cork> id's, classes, tags followed by the rest
[02:54:29] <Tingle> and noscript?
[02:54:36] <Cork> uh
[02:54:37] <Cork> no
[02:54:38] <Stephen> Typically best underneath the </body>
[02:54:46] <Cork> script is not allowed inside the html tag
[02:54:47] <Stephen> So they dont run until the body is rendered
[02:54:54] <Stephen> What?
[02:54:58] <Cork> in body or head but not in html
[02:54:58] <Stephen> Wrong
[02:55:00] <Cork> no
[02:55:13] <Stephen> I do this every day my friend
[02:55:19] <Stephen> It's fine
[02:55:32] <Cork> Stephen: then you are depending on the browser error correcting your pages
[02:55:46] <Tingle> well most pages, even the moz says to put it inside the bottom of the body, not outside o.O?
[02:55:47] <Cork> the only valid places for script tags is head or body
[02:56:03] <Stephen> :-/
[02:56:09] <Stephen> Whichever
[02:56:09] <Cork> the only truly correct place is head
[02:56:17] <Cork> but there is arguments for having it at the end of body
[02:56:40] <Stephen> Yeah, if deferment worked like it proposes we wouldn't have to do that
[02:56:48] <Tingle> but I will remove the div wrapper like suggested if you says thats oke
[02:56:56] <Stephen> Yeah
[02:57:06] <StupidWeasel> Newbish question here I'm sure, but why am I haveing problems using $("body").css(bla) from within an include? Full craptastic code here: http://share.stupidweasel.com/1381139816_6LYl.txt
[02:57:20] <Stephen> Point in case: Put your javascript in a separate file like a neat coder.
[02:57:26] <Stephen> We should all be so organized
[02:57:33] <Cork> StupidWeasel: are you running this in a ready wrapper?
[02:57:38] <TTomiK> Stephen: so you mean I should preload all the suggestions into an object which I'd give to all of the typeaheads?
[02:58:03] <TTomiK> Stephen: if there were just a few suggestions, that'd be nice, but there are thousands :)
[02:58:06] <Cork> Stephen: well nothing in that example states that he doesn't :)
[02:58:15] <StupidWeasel> nope, just sneaking it in at the bottom of html body.
[02:58:26] <Cork> StupidWeasel: ah, ok
[02:58:31] <Stephen> TTomiK: Confused as to which you were doing
[02:59:07] <TTomiK> Stephen: I'm confused why I just can't access the "parent" element from typeahead's source ?
[02:59:09] <Stephen> TTomiK: Done with it now though, you got it working.
[02:59:09] <Tingle> but now to the body > header thing, ids are faster than child selectors, but in this case, im only checking up one layer and there are no so many header, nav, main or footer elements on the page. so what convention is used here, a child selector or do I id my elements?
[02:59:21] <Cork> StupidWeasel: are you sure the generated url is valid?
[02:59:22] <TTomiK> Stephen: I don't have it working
[02:59:56] <TTomiK> Stephen: I don't know how to get the brand_model -field's value
[03:00:19] <Cork> StupidWeasel: also i don't see you ever defining curBg
[03:00:23] <TTomiK> Stephen: the typeahead has worked all the time, the initial question was how to get the brand_model -fields value
[03:00:24] <Stephen> TTomiK: Note, the () after typeahead is NOT in the scope of the object. It's in the scope of the surrounding function. () is for parameters
[03:00:39] <StupidWeasel> It's defined inline, it'll eventually be given by a php script you see.
[03:01:09] <Cork> StupidWeasel: have you checked so the $('body') call is actually made?
[03:01:29] <Stephen> TTomiK: You can't do it with a this, so just use the first part of the line again.
[03:02:31] <StupidWeasel> Ahh thanks Cork, I see what I've done now :D
[03:02:43] <Stephen> Bah
[03:02:50] <Tingle> redid my fiddle, so http://jsfiddle.net/3cpE9/3/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/3cpE9/4/ - which one :O?
[03:02:58] <Stephen> TTomiK: Are a lot of these fields populating the screen';
[03:03:03] <Stephen> ?
[03:03:12] <TTomiK> Stephen: there can be a lot of rows, yes
[03:03:16] <StupidWeasel> The urls were invalid, snuck a random ) in there and did not see it at the end of the alert(stuff) I was using to test it.
[03:03:42] <Cork> StupidWeasel: tip, use console.log instead of alert
[03:04:04] <Stephen> and the brand/model field has a distinct class on it, yeah?
[03:04:05] <Cork> StupidWeasel: it shows the content of things better then alert
[03:04:22] <TTomiK> Stephen: and... a row includes both, brand_model and model_code
[03:04:48] <Stephen> Yup
[03:05:26] <Stephen> But the same brand_model input will always have 1 matching model_code input, yes?
[03:05:57] <TTomiK> yes, that's how it should be
[03:06:30] <TTomiK> Stephen: one brand_model per model_code, row's brand_model is linked to model_code
[03:07:37] <TTomiK> Stephen: there could be a value "Chevrolet, Corvette" in the brand_model and the model_code should know that before asking for suggestions from server, hence the brand_model should be sent to server with ajax-call
[03:08:03] <StupidWeasel> Mmm the background is still not changing, although manually using $("body").css("background-image", "url(http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/162470/temp_byb/background_2.jpg)"); in the webconsole is working fine
[03:09:16] <Cork> StupidWeasel: use the inspector to see what is set on the body element
[03:10:05] <StupidWeasel> I have, it's still the default background_1.jpg
[03:11:01] <Cork> StupidWeasel: http://jsfiddle.net/C74xD/
[03:11:18] <Cork> works fine here, so check so you don't have !important or something set on the original line
[03:11:35] <JacquesBH> Hi guys !
[03:11:42] <JacquesBH> I've a little question about the new version 2.x
[03:12:09] <JacquesBH> Are the old methods like ajax/post/attr... always working with the 2.x ?
[03:12:21] <JacquesBH> (on IE 6/7/8... )
[03:13:10] <Cork> JacquesBH: 2.x works identical to 1.9.x except for the old ie support
[03:14:39] <Stephen> TTomiK: What are you using serverside?
[03:14:56] <TTomiK> Stephen: PHP (Laravel 4)
[03:14:57] <Cork> JacquesBH: the reason i said 1.9 is that attr was split into .prop and .attr a few version back, so if .attr works the same depends on what version you're coming from
[03:15:25] <TTomiK> Stephen: but no need to write server side code, I can do that :)
[03:15:26] <Stephen> TTomiK: So, here's an even easier way.
[03:16:04] <JacquesBH> Cork: My problem is : My customer want a website with IE 8 compatibility. I want use jQuery 2.x .. is that a good solution or not ?
[03:16:14] <Stephen> TTomiK: Any time brand_model changes, it should clear out model_code
[03:16:16] <Cork> JacquesBH: yes
[03:16:24] <JacquesBH> Cork: I use only few jquery things, like attr (it works on firefox), ajax, and co
[03:16:27] <Cork> JacquesBH: 1.9 and 2.0 is compatible, they are both supported
[03:16:40] <TTomiK> Stephen: yes
[03:16:42] <Stephen> TTomiK: By detaching and re-appending the node
[03:16:43] <Cork> JacquesBH: so you can use 2.0 and load 1.9 for ie (conditional comments)
[03:16:48] <JacquesBH> Cork: yes, but too on IE 8 ?
[03:16:50] <raptorsystems> unless they drop it into capability mode
[03:16:54] <JacquesBH> okok
[03:16:57] <raptorsystems> but if they do everything will explode
[03:16:59] <Cork> JacquesBH: 1.9 supports way back
[03:17:08] <Stephen> TTomiK:  that mean's you'd have to re-run typeahead.
[03:17:19] <Cork> JacquesBH: at least ie6, but i'm quite sure ie 5.5 is supported too
[03:17:23] <TTomiK> Stephen: That I do when creating new row
[03:17:43] <JacquesBH> Cork: ie < 8 -> Trash
[03:17:48] <Cork> :)
[03:18:10] <JacquesBH> Cork: so, I need to include both? 1.9 (or 1.10?) and 2.* ?
[03:18:18] <raptorsystems> JacquesBH++
[03:18:20] <Stephen> So, pass the value of  the closest brand_model as a parameter on the url
[03:18:22] <JacquesBH> or only one if IE and one if others?
[03:18:24] <Cork> JacquesBH: simplest is to use 1.10 straight of
[03:18:35] <JacquesBH> Cork: yes I think so
[03:19:00] <Cork> JacquesBH: the difference isn't enough to make it worth wile until april next year
[03:19:03] <Stephen> TTomiK: You'd need to detach it and re-add the model_code input each time brand_model changes
[03:19:12] <Cork> (when winxp dies)
[03:19:12] <Stephen> TTomiK:Read up on jQuery.detach()
[03:19:21] <Stephen> TTomiK: It's very simple
[03:19:41] <TTomiK> Stephen: can't I get the brand_model -parameter to data -object sent to server?
[03:19:58] <raptorsystems> json?
[03:20:04] <Stephen> You could pass it either way
[03:20:11] <Stephen> The url would be cleaner though
[03:20:34] <Stephen> The other way you'd need to make it part of the text
[03:20:35] <TTomiK> Stephen: I prefer POST
[03:20:53] <TTomiK> then the url stays clean
[03:21:12] <StupidWeasel> Cork: Thanks for all your help, I've updated the jsfiddle with the complete code i'm working with: http://jsfiddle.net/C74xD/1/
[03:21:25] <Stephen> If you are using MVC you could just make it a parameter in the route
[03:21:47] <TTomiK> Stephen: I am, but I still prefer post :)
[03:22:18] <TTomiK> Stephen: just to confirm: it's impossible to call .brand_model's value from typeahead's options ?
[03:22:35] <Stephen> TTomiK: Then you'll need to modify the typeahead to accept an additional parameter which you can pass in with the post
[03:22:39] <fat> im trying to use this select picker  http://jsfiddle.net/qtRhQ/45/ in my bootstrap site, but its not working and i have no idea. please help http://jsfiddle.net/6ChBG/1/
[03:22:43] <Stephen> Shouldn't be too bad
[03:22:49] <Stephen> 3 lines of code
[03:23:11] <TTomiK> Stephen: can I then write like $("input").typeahead(options, this) ?
[03:23:30] <Stephen> TTomiK: It depends on how you are running that line of code
[03:23:48] <TTomiK> I need the element, not the brand_model -value, because brand_model value can be changed
[03:23:56] <Stephen> Javascript has no sense of it's location unless it'sbeing dumped into the dom
[03:24:06] <raptorsystems> fat: have you looked at bootstraps modal?
[03:24:14] <TTomiK> I see, the location is the key here
[03:24:33] <JacquesBH> Thanks Cork
[03:24:55] <fat> raptorsystems: a little, not much
[03:25:39] <Stephen> TTomiK: Are you adding any parent elements around both these inputs when you add a row?
[03:26:49] <TTomiK> Stephen: yes, there are divs around the inputs
[03:27:08] <PhaseCode> Hey Stephen, Can I inquire your help one more time xD?
[03:27:11] <Stephen> TTomiK: Do they share a parent element?
[03:27:25] <TTomiK> Stephen: yes, div.product_data_row
[03:27:52] <Stephen> TTomiK: Awesome. So, when you create that row, keep that element in a variable.
[03:28:21] <Stephen> we'll call it divPDR for now.
[03:28:22] <TTomiK> it is in a variable when I create the row and then appended to div#product_data_rows :)
[03:28:23] <Cork> StupidWeasel: your adding the variable names to the url, not the content
[03:28:41] <Cork> StupidWeasel: background-image: url(backgroundPrefix + backgrounds[curBg+1][0]);
[03:29:09] <Stephen> Then,when you are creating/recreating the inputs, just use $("input.whatever", divPDR) to get the element
[03:29:17] <Stephen> Then you will always be in the scope of that row
[03:29:25] <raptorsystems> fat: sorry been too long since I played with bootstrap, but I'm not sure why your simple jqurey wouldn't be working
[03:29:30] <StupidWeasel> They make up the url though? Combined that'd be http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/162470/temp_byb/background_1.jpg ?
[03:29:36] <Cork> StupidWeasel: http://jsfiddle.net/C74xD/3/
[03:29:43] <fat> raptorsystems: thank you anyway
[03:29:48] <Cork> StupidWeasel: no, they don't
[03:29:53] <Cork> StupidWeasel: as you don't use them as variables
[03:30:01] <StupidWeasel> Oh right I see what you mean now. I'm an idiot :D
[03:30:06] <StupidWeasel> Thank you :)
[03:30:22] <Cork> np
[03:30:41] <TTomiK> Stephen: I'm creating the first product row in a PHP view that I'm copying (and cleaning the inputs) when user clicks a new row
[03:31:21] <TTomiK> Stephen: ...but even on the first row the model_code should pass the brand_model to server
[03:32:12] <PhaseCode> Here's an issue http://jsfiddle.net/mq2SU/ , I am trying to get it to change the 'checked' attribute when you click onto one that doesn't have the checked attribute. So if I click One Of it will move the checked="checked onto the #npsScoreOneOf but when I click back to Is Equal to , it doesn't move the checked back to #npsScoreIs
[03:32:32] <Stephen> TTomiK: You just need to be sure that the code which sets up the event which detaches/recreates the model_code input is in the same function as the row being created
[03:33:19] <Stephen> TTomiK: Or, in the first row's case, you  need to write a separate function which essentially does the same thing, but it runs after the dom loads
[03:33:23] <Stephen> but only once
[03:33:53] <TTomiK> Stephen: http://pastebin.com/EF9Jw8rR
[03:35:06] <TTomiK> Stephen: that's how I create a new row now
[03:37:29] <PhaseCode> Any idea guys
[03:42:24] <Stephen> TTomiK: Working on it
[03:42:39] <Stephen> TTomiK: Can you get me what the dom of a single row looks like?
[03:43:17] <Stephen> TTomiK: Are the two inputs right next to one another, or do they each have their own wrapping divs?
[03:45:27] <PhaseCode> welp fixed it :)
[03:45:30] <Stephen> TTomiK: Ping
[03:50:29] <TTomiK> Stephen: sorry... dom of the single row?
[03:50:33] <TTomiK> Stephen: how can I get that?
[03:53:29] <Stephen> TTomiK: http://jsfiddle.net/jCa2h/
[03:53:39] <Stephen> That code will need to be adjusted to match your variables
[03:53:44] <Stephen> But it should make sense
[03:54:08] <Stephen> TTomiK: IF you use firefox, install an extension called Firebug
[03:54:21] <TTomiK> I have firebug
[03:54:37] <Stephen> It's all good.
[03:54:42] <Stephen> Look at that link I sent you
[03:54:50] <Stephen> see if it makes sense to you
[03:56:59] <Stephen> TTomiK: Small error there, here's the update
[03:57:00] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/jCa2h/1/
[03:57:42] <ph88> how can i measure the time it takes the browser to put stuff in the DOM ?
[03:57:57] <ph88> not load the entire page, or the ajax request ... just the placing of html in dom
[03:58:00] <TTomiK> so that whateverproperty should be set to, for example .brand_model -element?
[03:58:05] <TTomiK> Stephen^
[03:58:20] <TTomiK> Stephen: will javascript keep in track of the index ?
[03:58:43] <Stephen> ph88: read up on requestAnimationFrame, it can do it
[03:59:03] <TTomiK> Stephen: ah.. sorry, it always sets the value on keyup
[03:59:29] <TTomiK> Stephen: I'll try that
[03:59:31] <Stephen> TTomiK: You can change that to whatever event works best for you
[04:00:27] <Stephen> TTomiK: The model textbox should't be requesting from the server until itself is typed in, so the onkeyup shouldn't be a problem
[04:00:33] <Stephen> Ok, about time for work
[04:00:37] <Stephen> Later folks
[04:00:54] <TTomiK> Stephen: thank you very much
[04:07:00] <shwaiil> Hi
[04:07:33] <ph88> Stephen: is requestAnimationFrame() for before and after ??
[04:08:54] <hxm> hi hello
[04:08:59] <shwaiil> Q: I know that $(iframe).ready(fn); Can tell us when an iframe is ready. But, since this is being generated dynamically, I can't bind the event ready when the iframe is created because I can't predict when that happens. At the moment works fine with .ready() but I know that this is wrong. Any advice ? Thanks for looking!
[04:09:36] <Stephen> ph88: I don't know how to use it, I just know you can. You can also use setTimer to do it, but it's much less acurate
[04:09:42] <Stephen> goodbye
[04:10:17] <ph88> bai
[04:10:32] <shwaiil> * maybe I'm wrong, and this just works anytime I just bind .ready() even if it's already loaded ?!
[04:21:47] <seutje> is there a way to apply a class to the body before calling window.print();, and then removing said class when the print dialog is closed? if I understand correctly, onafterprint trigger just *before* the dialog appears
[04:22:27] <Cork> seutje: don't think so
[04:22:38] <Cork> seutje: and you can't use a media query?
[04:23:09] <seutje> thing is, it's a modal, but just a div, no iframe, gotta hijack print links in there and make them only print the modal content
[04:23:17] <Cork> @media print { .special-class {  } }
[04:23:27] <Cork> ah
[04:23:36] <seutje> so I figured I'd slap a "print-modal" class on the body when the print link is within a modal and do the rest in print.css
[04:23:47] <seutje> then remove it when done printing, which I can't detect q.q
[04:24:14] <seutje> I don't wanna open a tab with just that content in there and then window.print that :/
[04:24:50] <seutje> suppose I could add the class and remove it when the modal is closed
[04:25:04] <seutje> but that's like linking 2 completely unrelated pieces of interaction :/
[04:25:11] <seutje> and assuming they are related
[04:30:33] <TTomiK> anyone... what causes the error? http://jsfiddle.net/ErzE4/
[04:55:00] <starlays> hello to all, dose someone know how the bar from the right is called? http://i.imgur.com/RtCGaQ6.png
[05:12:31] <Cork> starlays: that looks like the chromes scrollbar with the find overlay
[05:29:27] <hxm> i how to send a submit form with jquery and prevent the default
[05:29:58] <Cork> hxm: you want $.ajax or $.post/$.get
[05:30:51] <Dirkos> i register my plugin like: http://pastebin.com/KXMFqqQn
[05:31:11] <Dirkos> but how can i access it after it is already loaded like: $('#foo').pluginName();
[05:31:40] <starlays> Cork: i'm using it in firefox, how can i create that find overlay?
[05:31:52] <t432> can somebody tell me teh purpose of the line "query:" in "this.trigger('autocomplete-select', {query: ui.item.label});"?
[05:32:04] <Cork> starlays: only chrome has that one as far as i know
[05:32:06] <hxm> with ajax Cork
[05:32:21] <hxm> i have all code done but when I click the submit button nothing happens
[05:32:26] <t432> I'm refering to "query: ui.item.label"
[05:32:29] <grafi> t432 additional data passed on to the event handlers
[05:32:43] <Cork> Dirkos: that loading structure doesn't provide a way to access the plugin
[05:33:08] <grafi> t432 .trigger( eventType [, extraParameters ] ),
[05:33:08] <grafi> extraParameters
[05:33:08] <grafi> Type: Array or PlainObject
[05:33:08] <grafi> Additional parameters to pass along to the event handler.
[05:33:11] <Dirkos> Cork: any tips on how i should do that? What i see very often is that i can just call it on the dom element for example?
[05:33:23] <Dirkos> or how should i do it?
[05:33:26] <t432> grafi: how would i access this data?
[05:34:13] <t432> let me get a pastebin.
[05:34:31] <Cork> Dirkos: else { var plugin = $.data(this, "plugin_" + pluginName); return plugin.apply(plugin, arguments); }
[05:34:39] <grafi> t432 in your handler the first argument is the event, all arguments after that are the additional parameters
[05:35:21] <grafi> t432 so like function(event, param1, param2) for .trigger('superduperevent', ['Param1', 'Param2'])
[05:35:43] <grafi> of course the additional stuff is not limited to strings ;)
[05:36:15] <Dirkos> Cork: and access it?
[05:36:27] <Cork> Dirkos: that is for accessing it
[05:36:47] <Cork> Dirkos: the if case checks if the plugin has been added for the target element
[05:36:57] <Cork> Dirkos: you need an else case for allowing access
[05:37:08] <Dirkos> but i access it as $('domelement') ? for example
[05:37:24] <Dirkos> so the $('dom').stop() will execute the stop function or how should i use it
[05:37:43] <Cork> Dirkos: yes
[05:38:03] <Dirkos> Cork: hmm does not really seem to work though
[05:38:18] <t432> grafi: trying to log line 26 in line 56 but all i get is [object object] in consoel - http://pastebin.com/YYhxnahL
[05:38:43] <Cork> Dirkos: how are the objects expeted to be called?
[05:39:07] <Dirkos> well i can decide whatever i want
[05:39:15] <Dirkos> i have a slider plugin which i wanna stop in some cases
[05:39:26] <Dirkos> so i added a "stop" function but i want to call it
[05:39:34] <Dirkos> _outside_ the plugin
[05:40:01] <t432> Cork: can you also take a look?
[05:40:09] <grafi> t432 try console.log(arguments) maybe that'll help
[05:41:04] <Cork> t432: what grafi said is correct
[05:41:17] <grafi> wohoo
[05:41:18] <grafi> :P
[05:41:51] <t432> grafi: that just prints [object arguments]
[05:42:04] <grafi> oô
[05:42:20] <Cork> t432: but autocomplete doesn't take a extraParams argument
[05:42:24] <t432> here is the edited line 56 : this.search = function(event) { 	  console.log(arguments);
[05:42:30] <grafi> chrome devtools, firebug?
[05:43:32] <t432> Cork: I need to access the selected value from line 56 somehow, how would you do it?
[05:43:32] <Dirkos> Cork: any tips?
[05:43:58] <t432> grafii: I'm working with Dev Tools (Forefox)
[05:44:02] <t432> Firefox*
[05:44:19] <Cork> Dirkos: i would access the functions as pluginName('function name', options)
[05:44:27] <grafi> hm, no idea why it wouldnt let you inspect the object then t432 ...
[05:44:27] <Cork> Dirkos: similar to how jquery ui does it
[05:45:10] <t432> grafi: if i click on [object arguments] in console i am able to inspect the dom
[05:45:20] <Cork> t432: trigger expects an array
[05:45:27] <Cork> [{ query: "" }]
[05:46:10] <grafi> you think thats the problem?
[05:46:12] <grafi> hm
[05:46:12] <grafi> ...
[05:46:24] <t432> Cork: can you elaborate a little more?
[05:46:26] <Cork> yes, cause it will take it as an event object if it isn't an array
[05:46:45] <t432> Cork: how  about a pastebin?
[05:47:00] <Cork> t432: just add [] around the object and it should work
[05:47:07] <Dirkos> Cork: yeah but that does not work with the way i do it is it? I now do a $(' #slider').senSlider('stop');
[05:47:09] <t432> what line?
[05:47:22] <Dirkos> Cork: TypeError: plugin.apply is not a function
[05:47:41] <Cork> t432: the line where you call trigger
[05:48:16] <Cork> Dirkos: i would recommend using one of the boiler plates
[05:48:33] <Dirkos> Cork: well i used this boilerplate too
[05:49:09] <Cork> the good boiler plates makes the plugins callable by default
[05:49:22] <Dirkos> example on a __good__ boilerplate?
[05:50:31] <t432> Cork: are you refering line 26, 56 or some other ine http://pastebin.com/YYhxnahL
[05:50:37] <t432> line*
[05:50:56] <Cork> the trigger line, where you call trigger
[05:52:05] <t432> Cork: line 61?
[05:52:28] <Cork> eh...
[05:52:53] <Cork> call, as in requesting that it gets executed
[05:53:51] <Dirkos> Cork: i used this: http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[05:55:32] <Cork> Dirkos: ya... that is the broken boilerplate...
[05:55:38] <Dirkos> ah shit
[05:55:42] <Dirkos> can u give me a good one?
[05:55:48] <Cork> it allows you to call the plugin once per element in the page
[05:55:49] <t432> Cork: that will be line 61  this.on(document,'autocomplete-select', this.search);
[05:55:58] <Cork> and then you can't ever call that plugin again for that element
[05:56:27] <Cork> t432: where do you see "trigger" in that string?
[05:56:33] <Dirkos> Cork: if u can me suggest a new one i could reprogram it :)
[05:57:00] <t432> Cork: you mean this line? this.trigger('autocomplete-select', {query: $queryInput.val()});
[05:57:07] <Cork> yes
[05:57:21] <t432> I can't do this.trigger('autocomplete-select', {[query: $queryInput.val()]});
[05:57:35] <t432> e.g. add [] arounf [query: ..]
[05:57:43] <limpc> hi guys. anyone with experience using prototype mixed in with jquery?  We're slowly upgrading a client's systems to jquery, due to complexity.  I have a dialog we've upgraded to Colorbox, but the data returned by the server has a prototype method it tries to execute on load.  the method exists, but i keep getting an error saying it doesn't.
[05:58:00] <limpc> Googling around has mentioned using class.prototype.method, which I tried, but it didnt help
[05:58:34] <Cork> Dirkos: widget factory is a nice one
[05:58:48] <Dirkos> ok thnx
[05:59:05] <Cork> Dirkos: and the one i usually use as a template when i write my own solutions
[05:59:34] <t432> Cork: did you get tht?
[05:59:54] <Cork> Dirkos: though i can't find the boilerplate i want to show you :s
[06:00:09] <Cork> Dirkos: it is built similar to widget factory but thinner
[06:01:42] <Dirkos> ah well no problem :) i will do my best with the widget factory one
[06:01:59] <Cork> Dirkos: basically it is a modified version of that boilerplate you use
[06:02:07] <limpc> nobody?
[06:02:52] <Dirkos> Cork: well would be cool if you can find it though
[06:04:52] <Cork> Dirkos: http://jsfiddle.net/Czku6/
[06:04:53] <t432> Cork: talk to me. :-)
[06:04:55] <Cork> something like that
[06:05:23] <t432> sorry,didnt see your dealing someone;
[06:05:48] <Cork> t432: you added the array inside the object, not around it
[06:06:33] <BrazenBraden> i cant understand why jquery is not catching any of my ajax events.. any idea? (developing in rails 4 btw)  https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/b3f8fbf9c20d516c6082
[06:06:33] <t432> Cork: you mean like this? alreayd tried that  this.trigger('autocomplete-select', [{query: $queryInput.val()}]);
[06:06:40] <Cork> yes
[06:06:40] <Dirkos> Cork: thanks alot
[06:07:04] <Cork> BrazenBraden: what version of jquery?
[06:07:48] <BrazenBraden> 1.7.2
[06:08:33] <Cork> hmm, not sure then, never used those event much (and they've been deprecated in 1.9)
[06:08:49] <t432> Cork: ok I added the [] around the objects and I have this.search = function(event) { console.log([arguments]);}; <--- this prints out [object Array]
[06:09:26] <Cork> t432: function(event, obj) { console.log(obj.query); }
[06:09:47] <BrazenBraden> Cork: deprecated? is the api out of date?  http://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/
[06:10:29] <Cork> BrazenBraden: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#ajax-events-should-be-attached-to-document
[06:11:13] <BrazenBraden> Cork: interesting... but considering my js is still 1.7, mine should technically work fine?
[06:11:33] <Cork> BrazenBraden: not sure if you should use the namespace structure
[06:11:42] <Cork> but apart from that, yes it looks valid
[06:12:00] <Cork> (the namespace structure was why i said not sure before)
[06:12:23] <BrazenBraden> Cork: the 'ajax:<event>' namespace is built-in to the rails jquery wrapper
[06:12:31] <Cork> ah
[06:12:47] <Cork> then you would have to look into jquery_rails.js
[06:13:47] <BrazenBraden> https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/blob/master/src/rails.js  <- like line 86 says, "if (rails.fire(element, 'ajax:before')) {"
[06:13:54] <BrazenBraden> so that is the sort of structure it uses
[06:14:29] <bberry> g'morning jquery. I am trying to get all the elements inside a <div>.  can i just do $("#divID").("tagtype").each(function(){ //do stuff }) ?
[06:14:30] <Cork> BrazenBraden: then you would have to look at rails.fire
[06:14:49] <Cork> bberry: no that doesn't parse
[06:14:52] <bberry> er, s/get/loop on/
[06:15:02] <Cork> bberry: you need a name of the function to call
[06:15:05] <Cork> $().find()
[06:15:22] <t432> Cork: 'undefined' line, 16, 52 -> http://pastebin.com/2qiFqTzj
[06:16:09] <Cork> t432: then you arn't getting a normal event handler
[06:16:42] <t432> Cork: I'm working with https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/doc/base_api.md#this.trigger
[06:18:56] <lianzinho> hey guys, I have an element with I'm replacing with a clone of it. But I want to attach the event which is firing this replacement in the clone, how could I do that?
[06:19:14] <Cork> lianzinho: clone(true)
[06:19:22] <Cork> ?api clone
[06:19:23] <b-ot> Cork: .clone(): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[06:20:23] <Samsamyumyum> feedly down?
[06:20:32] <lianzinho> Cork:  i'm already doing that, the problem is. The last event is not bound yet… I mean, the replacement is done inside of the callback so the clone does not have this one attached yet
[06:21:23] <Cork> lianzinho: then you would have to add that one separately; or even better use delegated event listener and skip the element specific event listeners all together
[06:22:06] <lianzinho> should I add it before using it? how could I do that?
[06:22:42] <Cork> lianzinho: depends on how the code looks
[06:23:05] <Cork> ?down www.feedly.com
[06:23:05] <b-ot> Cork: It's just you. http://www.feedly.com is up! (200 OK)
[06:24:09] <lianzinho> el.on('close', function(){el.replaceWith(clonedElement)}  <-- I want this 'close' event to be attached as well. This way, it will fire only once and never more
[06:24:45] <Cork> lianzinho: so add it before you clone el
[06:25:18] <Cork> var clonedElement; el.on(); clonedElement = el.clone(true);
[06:25:41] <lianzinho> can I just add the enventListener without setting the actual callback ?
[06:25:48] <Cork> lianzinho: btw, why are you replacing the element with a clone?
[06:26:07] <Cork> lianzinho: the on() was representing the full callback
[06:26:13] <lianzinho> Cork: I want to restore all the initial properties of it
[06:26:45] <t432> Cork: solved
[06:26:46] <Cork> lianzinho: it is normally better to just keep record about the things you change
[06:27:02] <Cork> lianzinho: else you fast end up with a script that isn't compatible with scripts it doesn't know about
[06:27:04] <lianzinho> lianzinho: it's a modal with a kind of login form. After the login it opens an iframe. I want it to restore the initial state of it once the modal is dismissed
[06:27:21] <Cork> lianzinho: form.reset() ?
[06:28:35] <lianzinho> Cork: I don't think so, because It's not a real submission, just pass the parameters to the iframe url and it is loaded inside the iframe
[06:28:54] <lianzinho> sorry, inside the modal
[06:29:31] <lianzinho> so, once the modal is dismissed I want it to go back to the initial state, with the empty form and a "virgin" iframe
[06:34:49] <lianzinho> Cork: so, I need to replace inside the 'close' event… are there any way to attach just the listener?
[06:48:34] <lianzinho> Cork: if I bind inside the callback, it does not work!
[06:53:23] <bberry> So i am looking at this answer on stackoverflow, but and theyre all setting the click event to a function.  If i only need it for a specific set of circumstances, isnt it a but inefficient to constantly be calling this click event function when its not being used? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1403615/use-jquery-to-hide-a-div-when-the-user-clicks-outside-of-it
[06:54:01] <bberry> er, delete the `but` from that >.<

[06:55:49] <hooligan132> hi
[06:58:30] <hooligan132> i want to use a on: touchstart .. but the program already uses bind mousedown .. will both events fire on a mobile device how do i deal with this.. should I use `bind` in stead of `on` any way
[07:01:34] <hooligan132> the bind mouse down is needed for normal pc's which works on mobile devices but its behavior on the screen is fugly
[07:01:43] <hooligan132> i hopeing but using touchstart it will be cleaner on mobile

[07:20:30] <shwaiil> Q: What's difference between doing $scope.$watch('$scope.foo', fn()) vs $scope.$watch(function(){ return $scope.foo; }, fn()) ? Thanks for looking!
[07:27:55] <xec_> shwaiil: the first gives a string as first param
[07:28:16] <xec_> shwaiil: the other is a function :P
[07:28:42] <xec_> what on earth is $scope and $watch anyway
[07:28:47] <shwaiil> xec_: yeh, but I've seen some people using 'scope.foo' or 'location.path()' when var location = $location
[07:29:26] <xec_> what?
[07:29:33] * xec_ is confused
[07:32:17] <dcherman> shwaiil: you'd have much better luck asking that in the #angularjs room
[07:32:39] <shwaiil> oh LOL

[08:03:32] <bberry> Hey guys, I have several text input, selects, and checkboxes in a div and id like to make an object out of all their values.  Is there an easy awesome way to do this?
[08:04:28] <jop008> I fI have a <ull>li> page and within it a table with 3 columns how to make it look good on both iphone and ipad? Site can be seen here www.happyaway.nl
[08:05:17] <jop008> Must I do a browser detect thing with an if? Or making it responsive (if possible)
[08:09:10] <asteve> so I'm working through http://www.jqfundamentals.com/chapters/traversing-manipulating
[08:09:25] <asteve> I want to change the text from my unordered list from HTML to tacos
[08:09:42] <yuradoc_> how to set default dialog position at 0,0
[08:09:42] <asteve> but the structure is "#my-unordered-list li span i"
[08:11:54] <JLT> Ok I don't have a live example here but I have my code. http://jsbin.com/umaMIKA/1 basically the callback for when .animate has been said to complete... it doesn't even run. I tested this by using an alert (Don't shoot me, it's just quicker than using console.log). My second issue would be I'm pretty sure there is a simpler way to writing it.. maybe a toggle? Not sure thoug.
[08:17:20] <asteve> I have a returned jquery object
[08:17:27] <JoshHou> hello, i am trying to integrate bxslider into a page, but its not running, the console is also not showing what part is causing the issue clearly, http://dev.experientialvehicles.com/vehicles/48-custom-marketing-trailer/
[08:17:29] <asteve> I want to go deeper in the css selectors
[08:17:45] <asteve> myJqueryObject = $('#unordered-list li').first()
[08:17:57] <asteve> how do I get to #unordered-list li span i?
[08:18:57] <NoiseEee> $('#unordered-list li').first().find('i')
[08:19:01] <JLT> Ah right.. you need an easing parameter before the callback otherwise it fails despite the manual saying it's fine.
[08:20:19] <asteve> NoiseEee: thank you
[08:27:22] <InDigital> Hi! Has anybody used Tablesorter 2 plugin
[08:27:50] <vsgill> Hi Guys, I'm trying to add a div tag with class before and after an element but it seems to close the div before
[08:28:09] <jomofcw> Hello !
[08:28:17] <InDigital> I wohi
[08:28:23] <vsgill> anyone have an idea how to get the element into a div that i created on doc ready ?
[08:28:31] <JLT> Ok I changed it quite a bit now. http://jsbin.com/umaMIKA/1 this works fine until you abuse it. Sometimes this may happen: http://vvcap.net/db/r6O4RVSjsdb_Pi0QOPFk.htp where it .. appears to cut off midflow and doesn't continue the animation.
[08:29:15] <JLT> wait that's partly a css fault... at least for the red box. The photo-date and photo-rate don't go back to opacity: 0; sometimes. it'll stay put at 1.
[08:31:08] <vsgill> can someone take a look for me http://pastebin.com/qH8HQttm
[08:31:33] <jomofcw> Is that a known issue please ? Using IE (tested on version 9 and 10, probably happens too ousing 7-8), when I create an element with an ID (i.e. : $('<div id="myID"></div>');) and insert it later in DOM (using .insertAfter() method), it doesn't "get" the CSS defined in the stylesheet for the ID "myID"... it works on each other browser.
[08:31:36] <jedimind> yeah taht doesnt work the way you expect it to vsgill
[08:31:58] <jedimind> vsgill what youre looking for is .wrap()
[08:32:00] <jedimind> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[08:32:01] <vsgill> jedimind, how can I achieve this using jquery
[08:32:14] <vsgill> yeah there is a div before that jedimind
[08:32:18] <JLT> Ok I didn't wanna show a live link but here: http://178.78.101.246/collager/user.php hover over the image really fast and leave it.. you'll eventually end up with the text showing... but the red area back to it's original state (smaller)
[08:32:22] <JLT> I'm not sure how to fix this
[08:33:09] <vsgill> JLT, use a timer
[08:33:13] <jedimind> no dont use a timer.
[08:33:25] <jedimind> use stop() to prevent animation bubbling
[08:33:30] <jedimind> also all of that could've been done with just css3
[08:33:45] <JLT> If you haven't seen my code, look here: http://jsbin.com/umaMIKA/1
[08:33:47] <JLT> I do use .stop
[08:34:16] <jedimind> JLT try using fadeIn() instead of animate opacity
[08:34:35] <vsgill> I normally add a timer delay when I do roll over stuff
[08:34:36] <JLT> I thought fadeOut will actually end up being display: none; ?
[08:35:00] <vsgill> if you have many you want want to move your mouse across all and have the animation running on them all
[08:35:02] <jedimind> for the photo-date and photo-rate
[08:35:09] <jomofcw> ERATUM : Is that a known issue please ? Using IE (tested on version 9 and 10, probably happens too ousing 7-8), when I create an element with an ID (i.e. : $('<div id="myID"></div>');) and insert it later in DOM (using .insertAfter() method) then I remove it and then insert it again (in fact it fires on a hover event), it doesn't "get" the CSS defined in the stylesheet for the ID "myID"... it
[08:35:09] <jomofcw> works on each other browser.
[08:35:09] <vsgill> jedimind, help me :\
[08:35:16] <jedimind> vsgill i did, whats the problem ?
[08:35:21] <jedimind> use .wrap() i told you
[08:35:34] <vsgill> oh yes you did, missed that
[08:35:37] <vsgill> thanks :D
[08:35:39] <vsgill> let me try it
[08:36:07] <jedimind> JLT i would totally use css3 for all of this
[08:36:48] <JLT> jedimind but.. I'm not keen on css3. I'm still looking to support IE8 which isn't all that good on it yet
[08:37:05] <JLT> For small bits like rounded corners and shadows... it still looks ok without
[08:37:07] <jedimind> but youre handicapping everyone else for 4% of the potential browsers?
[08:37:11] <jedimind> i mean in IE8 it just wont animate
[08:37:14] <jedimind> but it'll still work
[08:37:21] <JLT> hmm
[08:37:33] <JLT> ok hit me. How would I go about doing it?
[08:37:36] <jedimind> hold on let me whip up a quick example
[08:38:00] <JLT> I can't use .fadeIn/Out because it'll eventually end up as display: none; which will break it... took me ages to get it to work as it does lol. hence why it only goes to opacity: 0;
[08:40:40] <JLT> I could use fadeTo in fact I just tried and the same issue occurs. I'm looking forward to seeing a css3 solution
[08:40:43] <guilhermeduailib> Please, in my page, have a moment when i click in the input-text that appear an div in front. is there a way to "found" where is calling this div?
[08:43:24] <jedimind> JLT http://jsfiddle.net/PMfSd/
[08:44:16] <jedimind> you can obviously tweak the animations and such to your hearts content
[08:44:17] <JLT> oh nice.. wow.
[08:45:32] <jedimind> its a lot smoother, uses hardware acceleration
[08:45:42] <jedimind> no need to worry about show/display logic and animation bubbling
[08:46:30] <JLT> I'm not sure how I'd do it with li's though. As I'm using a css framework and I'm using columns so.
[08:46:46] <JLT> i may be able to figure it out though
[08:46:49] <jedimind> you dont have to use LIs
[08:46:49] <JLT> with the example
[08:47:09] <jedimind> the same thing applies to any html elements you want
[08:47:26] <JLT> would jquery eventually get rid of all the fancy things in favor of css?
[08:47:38] <jedimind> JLT they kind of are, 2.* uses css3 animations
[08:47:58] <jedimind> but more and more i hope that jquery focuses more on functional things and not presentational animation-y things
[08:48:07] <jedimind> and leave that for css3
[08:52:01] <bberry> anyone have a good article on selectors?
[08:53:19] <bberry> eh, nvm.
[08:57:26] <vsgill> jedimind, i can't seem to get my head around it
[08:57:28] <vsgill> doesn't wory
[08:58:17] <vsgill> work

[09:24:18] <reloadz> hi! I try to get back json, and in fire bug it look great, but when I try to console.log(object) - I get object back wraped in <pre> tag! why?
[09:24:54] <anildigital> Hi friends.. I have to show dynamic pages from JSON data .. which can have n level sections
[09:25:01] <reloadz> Plus i use this, to get json back in correct way... still not working! header('Content-type: application/json');
[09:25:13] <anildigital> so if there is sections display the sections and upon click of a section display the next
[09:25:22] <anildigital> next can be a data or it can be sections again
[09:25:31] <jphase> reloadz: sounds like you may want to try something like "die(json_encode($yourJSON));" in your PHP script
[09:25:54] <anildigital> there will be a back button too that will allow going back to the previous section
[09:26:38] <reloadz> jphase: i get in respone OK json!
[09:26:49] <reloadz> response*
[09:27:25] <jphase> reloadz: oh okay, try doing something like passing dataType: 'json' to your .ajax call, or do something like console.log($.parseJSON(data));
[09:41:31] <vsgill> jedimind, got it working in the end.
[09:47:30] <rcr_> Is there any common reason why an ajax call might -only sometimes- hang?  I put a waiting message up, and on complete hide it.  Occasionally the transaction goes through on the backend but the waiting div never goes away
[09:48:14] <rcr_> I've thought about putting a timeout on it, and alerting the user that it has timed out, but that wouldnt be totally correct since the transactions do actually succeed
[09:57:57] <andrew9183> any flot experts around

[10:20:14] <dwarder> anyone uses handlebars?
[10:23:19] <wort_hall> guys. I'm a jquery front end newbie. i have a final project
[10:23:40] <wort_hall> due for class. I am trying to incorporate a jQuery nav accordion to
[10:23:56] <wort_hall> my landing page. those who have experience in this, what is the most
[10:24:26] <wort_hall> effective way to customize this jQuery accordion to have the look and
[10:24:29] <wort_hall> feel I want?
[10:24:55] <bberry> css?
[10:25:19] <wort_hall> bberry: my css skills are a about average.
[10:25:28] <jphase> wort_hall: are you needing a custom accordion as opposed to something like jQuery UI (since it's an assignment)?
[10:26:16] <wort_hall> jphase: my custom I just being stylized. It could be any generic jQuery accordion.
[10:26:52] <jphase> wort_hall: can't really help you out there, you could style that in so many ways it's hard to point you in any direction, let alone the right one ;)
[10:28:01] <jphase> wort_hall: but if you want a custom easy accordion, with basic styles, markup, and code, you can take a look at this for reference if you'd like: but if you want a custom easy accordion
[10:28:11] <wort_hall> jphase: http://tinyurl.com/mrf2th8
[10:28:26] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/F6TPs/
[10:28:51] <wort_hall> jphase: i'm using this one. let me post a screenshot of my mockup
[10:28:54] <wort_hall> landing page.
[10:28:54] <jphase> yeah, there are just too many approaches to styling that you could take, in the eye of the beholder
[10:29:19] <wort_hall> jphase: so this is purely subjective, and I'm just going to have
[10:29:30] <wort_hall> to hunker down with the css. is that the case?
[10:29:47] <jphase> wort_hall: yeah, not really a way around it
[10:29:58] <jphase> but if you have questions, the folks in #css are quite friendly most days ;)
[10:30:16] <wort_hall> jphase: alright. well I wanted to start off with a base jquery accordion
[10:30:37] <wort_hall> jphase: that way I could build from that as oppose to removing styles
[10:30:48] <wort_hall> jphase: from one that is really pretty.
[10:30:55] <jphase> wort_hall: sure thing, if you need help just make a fiddle of it
[10:31:47] <wort_hall> jphase: i will. thank you. Are the fiddle docs pretty newbie friendly
[10:32:04] <wort_hall> jphase: still getting used to how you don't include certain tags when using it.
[10:32:52] <jphase> wort_hall: they're pretty easy, you just paste the contents into each box (no body tags, etc.), then select your jQuery version from the top drop down
[10:34:00] <wort_hall> jphase: btw, the nav accordion doesn't have to be in jQuery, could
[10:34:14] <wort_hall> be javascript. which approach is best, considering I'm new to both?
[10:34:21] <jphase> jQuery ftw
[10:34:38] <jphase> it's about 20-30 less lines of code
[10:34:43] <wort_hall> jQuery: will google, jQuery accordion nav. I really want to get
[10:34:57] <wort_hall> jphase: woops... good at this.
[10:35:01] <jphase> wort_hall: check out my fiddle link I posted to you earlier
[10:35:10] <FernandoBasso> I am working on an old website with jquery 1.4.1. How to get the value of the id attribute?
[10:35:16] <jphase> wort_hall: it's very simple for an accordion approach and it has comments :)
[10:35:19] <wort_hall> jphase: but i gotta have this assignment done thank you for your help.
[10:35:25] <FernandoBasso> I'd use obj.attr( 'id' ) nowadays...
[10:36:35] <FernandoBasso> .prop()
[10:36:46] <ajpiano> FernandoBasso: you should always just use obj.id
[10:36:57] <ajpiano> there's no reason to use attr or prop to read the id, it's always there as .id
[10:37:06] <FernandoBasso> From a jquery object?
[10:37:07] <wort_hall> jphase: you're a beast. you're jsfiddle will be beneficial to me. :D
[10:37:28] <ajpiano> FernandoBasso: no
[10:37:34] <ajpiano> on the dom el itself
[10:37:36] <wort_hall> jphase: if I want to put plus/minus sign on left of nav bars to
[10:37:53] <wort_hall> jphase: denote opened and closed, do I need to use images for that?
[10:38:21] <jphase> wort_hall: yeah, I stole that from one of my client sites, it used font-awesome icons. Here's the live page:  http://portlandmarathon.org/volunteer/volunteer_faqs.php
[10:39:04] <FernandoBasso> ajpiano: https://gist.github.com/FernandoBasso/5608654 How would you do that in the this situation?
[10:39:07] <wort_hall> jphase: sweet. is it okay if I borrow it for the sake of this
[10:39:16] <wort_hall> jphase: final project in class?
[10:40:00] <ajpiano> FernandoBasso: i would just reference this.id
[10:40:11] <FernandoBasso> Oh, I get it. Thanks.
[10:40:19] * jedimind hugs ajpiano 
[10:40:29] <ajpiano> hi jedimind
[10:40:32] <wort_hall> jphase: the one I was working with was so convoluted, not trying
[10:40:43] <wort_hall> jphase: to spend so much time hacking the css.
[10:40:43] <FernandoBasso> ajpiano: I don't get the real difference between this and $(this).
[10:40:56] <wort_hall> jphase: your example is a nice skeleton I can flesh out. :)
[10:40:58] <FernandoBasso> Also, suck less with pure js and with jquery.
[10:41:06] <ajpiano> one is a dom element, the other calls jQuery(this), which returns a jQuery object
[10:42:02] <ajpiano> which has jQuery methods on it
[10:42:21] <FernandoBasso> ajpiano: I see. Thanks a lot.
[10:42:22] <ajpiano> but there is no reason to construct a jquery object and call the methods when there are dead simple pure dom equivalents
[10:42:28] <ajpiano> like domelement.id
[10:42:35] <FernandoBasso> I agree.
[10:42:51] <FernandoBasso> I just didn't know we can get the "naked" dom node after using jquery on it.
[10:43:07] <ajpiano> it doesn't like, mutate the original element
[10:43:27] <FernandoBasso> Like, var v = $('something'); <-- How to do v.id now?
[10:43:57] <ajpiano> var el = $("#foo")[0].id
[10:44:16] <FernandoBasso> Wonderful. You've made my day.
[10:44:31] <FernandoBasso> Thanks.

[10:55:38] <anildigital> js ninjas I am facing a problem ... not able to think design for implementing this problem mentioned in JS fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/e6Zdg/
[10:55:46] <anildigital> basically want to go n level deep subsections and come back..   http://jsfiddle.net/e6Zdg/
[10:58:36] <andrew9183> anildigital: why not just a stack
[10:59:35] <ioan> Hi. I have a form that works fine with jquery mobile, except one element, a "file upload" element. This "file upload" element works fine in simple html. Is there a way to show all the form elements with Jquery moblie except the "file upload" element?
[11:05:45] <bencc> if I want to listen to a a click event on all elements in the page do I need $(document).on('click', '*', function(){}) or just $(document).on('click', function(){}) ?
[11:06:52] <jphase> bencc: I'd just bind to the entire document, yeah
[11:07:24] <bencc> jphase: so without the '*' selector?
[11:07:43] <NoiseEee> bencc: but really, whats the use case
[11:07:57] <bencc> NoiseEee: click tracking on all elements
[11:19:30] <decoded> hey all
[11:19:38] <decoded> does changePage() work in wp7 ?
[11:21:25] <decoded> i get "error loading page"
[11:36:32] <ATX_123> I have a jquery dialog that I have "replaced" content on.  Users can highlight that content, but are unable to use ctrl+c to copy it.  NB. Right-click context menu *does* allow the content to be copied.  Any ideas what is preventing and how to fix?
[11:37:44] <Jon47> ATX_123: sounds like event listeners stopping propagation on keyboard events?
[11:38:33] <ATX_123> Jon47, seem s probable, but i don't really know enough to figure out where to start looking for a solution.  any suggestions?
[11:38:55] <duch_kazatel> ATX_123 something else is running a stopPropogation() or something similar on a parent to your div.
[11:39:50] <ATX_123> only using jquery.  is that an option within jquery itself to allow the dialog to stop propogation?
[11:41:51] <duch_kazatel> ATX_123 what do you mean "only using jquery"?
[11:41:55] <bradmaxs> I need to run a function after each() has finished but since it is asynchronous it is executing the function before each finishes.  Any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/WfQ4m/
[11:42:12] <duch_kazatel> and ATX_123 check out the docs: http://api.jquery.com/?s=propagation
[11:42:31] <ATX_123> duch_kazatel, I thought you were implying that i might have had a third party JS library that was interfering.
[11:42:58] <duch_kazatel> ATX_123 a plugin might have propagation stopped on the page.
[11:43:06] <duch_kazatel> for something specific.
[11:50:55] <EHLOVader> Anyone in here know of good libraries or techniques for making jquery ui input elements work in mobile right?
[11:51:24] <EHLOVader> spinners, datepickers, and maybe any similar libraries for select drop downs, like chosen, select2, etc?
[12:14:30] <asteve> is document a reserved word?
[12:14:35] <asteve> $(document) means the entire thing?
[12:15:18] <duch_kazatel> it means the document, yes.

[12:17:03] <asteve> sonotos: thanks
[12:36:45] <jax> how would i update a temperature real time with jquery ajax calls?
[12:36:59] <jax> is there some kind of loop function?
[12:37:26] <jax> setInterval i guess?
[12:37:59] <eph3meral> jax, socket.io
[12:38:35] <eph3meral> jax, but yes, setInterval is the basic way to do recurring events (e.g. you can semi simulate an interactive IRC type chat in js by just polling every 1.5s or so)
[12:39:24] <jax> well basically I got an API which delivers data in json format
[12:39:33] <jax> just need to call that script every second
[12:39:45] <eph3meral> sure, setInterval then
[13:15:54] <sunbeam> i init progress bar with $("#bar").progressbar({ value: 21 });
[13:16:03] <sunbeam> but get $(...).progressbar is not a function
[13:16:08] <sunbeam> how can this be ?
[13:16:22] <sunbeam> its a function in jquery 1.10 right?
[13:19:34] <jphase> sunbeam: sounds like you might not have jQuery UI installed?
[13:20:07] <sunbeam> jphase: how can i install this?
[13:20:36] <jphase> sunbeam: http://jqueryui.com/progressbar/  Click the download link and add jQuery UI to your project, then include the script and styles
[13:23:20] <EHLOVader> were there more people around now? anyone have any more input on my situation with jQueryUI and mobile?
[13:24:04] <EHLOVader> I was wanting to get date, numbers, and selects to work... trying to use the $.browser.mobile from http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/
[13:24:23] <EHLOVader> and also trying to use modernizr for the html5 form support, since safari 3 doesn't have it
[13:25:44] <jphase> EHLOVader: what seems to be the problem?
[13:26:20] <EHLOVader> well I can't get it to detect properly, but some of that may be the emulator, I am using browser stack
[13:26:39] <EHLOVader> I can probably roll my own, through some complicated modernizr checks and detectmobilebrowsers
[13:26:58] <EHLOVader> but I didn't know if there was a ready made solution, like I don't think selects have a graceful fallback
[13:27:37] <EHLOVader> but http://gregfranko.com/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/ does look like the best option, if I want mobile support
[13:27:44] <jphase> EHLOVader: like select box elements that is? You want to use the jqm selects but then fall back to something better for standard desktops?
[13:27:52] <jphase> (better than standard select that is?)
[13:28:16] <jphase> EHLOVader: I highly recommend using Harvest's Chosen plugin
[13:28:26] <EHLOVader> oh, what is jqm selects?
[13:28:31] <jphase> EHLOVader: http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[13:28:43] <EHLOVader> I am already using Select2  it is a rewrite of chosen, or just another option inspired by chosen
[13:29:36] <jphase> EHLOVader: jqm (jquery mobile) selects http://api.jquerymobile.com/selectmenu/
[13:29:53] <EHLOVader> works well because I also have one that works as an autocomplete
[13:30:02] <EHLOVader> yeah jphase
[13:30:07] <EHLOVader> I am already using jqueryui
[13:31:00] <EHLOVader> the current web stack I have is basically jquery ui bootstrap http://addyosmani.github.io/jquery-ui-bootstrap/ the select2 I mentioned https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/ and hansontable http://handsontable.com/
[13:31:01] <jphase> EHLOVader: yeah I'm not too familiar with too many other plugins you could use as a fallback to the UI approach, UI and Chosen are my go-to
[13:31:14] <EHLOVader> chosen doesn't do standard fallback though does it?
[13:31:21] <jphase> no,
[13:31:24] <EHLOVader> I heard their issue tracker and response was terrible
[13:31:33] <EHLOVader> that is how select2 happened I think
[13:31:49] <jphase> well harvest is quite repsonsive but maybe not to their Chosen plugin since it's open source
[13:31:59] <jphase> but I use them for time tracking and I can call them on the phone and they answer in 2 rings
[13:32:30] <EHLOVader> yeah
[13:32:59] <EHLOVader> interesting, well I do like it, but like what i have, weary of switching to selectboxit because it doesn't seem to support what select2 can do
[13:33:27] <jphase> no sense in fixing something that isn't broken :\
[13:33:32] <EHLOVader> hoping to hook focus, and or make the list show as a slide tab in mobile
[13:33:56] <EHLOVader> or for basic selects maybe just pass it the select object to focus and show the native UI
[13:34:22] <EHLOVader> but using type="date" doesn't seem to work all the time, so I started checking Modernizr for date support.. it didn't seem to work
[13:35:01] <graphettion> Can someone help me with a jQuery slideshow? I'm trying to show content but not exactly sure how to program it how I want. I want the text to easy back and forth. Any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/pJWPB/
[13:35:15] <EHLOVader> haven't gotten to numbers, but may try using a similar method the date.. basically was checking if !supports date or !mobile then use jqueryUI date
[13:38:34] <EHLOVader> I may have been using modernizr wrong
[13:39:55] <Lorcat> How would you recommend I add px to the end of an int
[13:42:58] <jedimind> int + "px"
[13:42:59] <jedimind> ?
[13:55:33] <cnap> hey guys I need a bit assistance
[13:55:41] <cnap> I have this part of my code: http://bpaste.net/show/08PKQcOLgsugBRwdOc42/
[13:56:01] <cnap> basically I do almost the same thing for 2 classes.. but I am sure that I can make a common bind event for both of them
[13:56:15] <cnap> I am not sure what to look at to make it properly work - whats the best practise
[14:15:02] <Scott0_> im getting NaN in firefox where im getting actual values ni a counter on chrome
[14:15:11] <Scott0_> what might be causing firefox to display Nan?
[14:18:19] <myosotis> the value is not a number
[14:18:29] <Scott0_> yes I understood that
[14:18:35] <Scott0_> but why is chrome displaynig a number?
[14:18:39] <Scott0_> obviously it's a number
[14:19:22] <myosotis> or a string that contains digits
[14:20:39] <graphettion> Can someone help me with a jQuery slideshow? I'm trying to show content but not exactly sure how to program it how I want. I want the text to ease back and forth. Any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/pJWPB/1/
[14:22:35] <myosotis> Scott0_, http://jsfiddle.net/GC2nS/
[14:23:02] <Scott0_> that doesn't do anything
[14:23:11] <myosotis> ugh, load jquery in top left dropdown
[14:23:16] <myosotis> jsfiddle messing with me
[14:23:51] <Scott0_> myosotis: looks good in firefox and chrome
[14:23:56] <Scott0_> what's the point?
[14:24:05] <myosotis> string containing digits is not a number
[14:24:15] <myosotis> astring + 5 prints out "1235" instead of 128
[14:24:22] <Scott0_> ok
[14:24:24] <Scott0_> so?
[14:24:32] <Scott0_> I get an actual number in chrome
[14:24:37] <myosotis> the last line +astring + 5 shows one way to turn a string containing digits into a number
[14:24:41] <Scott0_> but not in firefox
[14:25:04] <Scott0_> im not reading a value from an element
[14:25:23] <Scott0_> im only writing to an element from a variable which increments at a set rate
[14:25:35] <myosotis> can you provide a fiddle that illustrates your specific issue?
[14:25:41] <Scott0_> the only time I read is from a JSON file and that's using parseInt()
[14:27:05] <shoky> parseInt can return NaN
[14:27:25] <Scott0_> why would it not return NaN in both browsers
[14:27:36] <shoky> if you make a fiddle, we can see
[14:27:47] <Scott0_> im trying
[14:27:56] <Scott0_> but loading from a JSOn isn't something you can do with jsfiddle
[14:28:18] <shoky> you can
[14:28:23] <Scott0_> sorry, im usnig parseFloat
[14:28:26] <Scott0_> shoky: how?
[14:28:27] <shoky> not that you need to
[14:29:01] <shoky> $.post('/echo/json/', { json: JSON.stringify(myObj) })
[14:39:06] <Scott0_> shoky: im using getJSON
[14:39:36] <Lorcat> Hola, I am getting an undefined error when I try to use jquery. I was wondering if you would take a look at my line please? (Por favor)
[14:39:38] <Lorcat> $("#close_button").css( "margin-right", off_mright );
[14:40:30] <Lorcat> off_mright is a string...
[14:41:09] <shoky> Scott0_: doesn't matter
[14:41:13] <Lorcat> ^_^
[14:42:09] <shoky> Lorcat: what error?
[14:42:52] <Lorcat> when I console.log( $("#close_button").css("margin-right") ); I get undefined.
[14:43:10] <shoky> so?
[14:43:21] <Lorcat> shoky: That is the error?
[14:43:34] <shoky> doesn't sound like an error
[14:43:55] <shoky> `demo
[14:43:55] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:44:19] <Lorcat> Well obviously I am trying to set a css property to something other than undefined
[14:44:34] <Lorcat> shoky: I am not creating a fiddle for one line, my explanation was sufficient.
[14:44:48] <shoky> Lorcat: there is nothing wrong with the code you've shown
[14:45:20] <shoky> obviously your explanation isn't sufficient
[14:45:42] <Lorcat> shoky: No, it is.
[14:45:57] <shoky> ok.
[14:46:12] <dat_> I have 3 forms each has a button. when user clicks A it calls Afunc and so on. http://jsfiddle.net/abc123/ZCwyX/1/ However it doesn't work. Only Cfunc is called regardless of what user clicks. Please help
[14:46:30] <Lorcat> off_mright is a variable with a string, if you look back you will see this. I wrote it previously. It is not undefined.
[14:46:46] <shoky> still not sufficient
[14:47:14] <Scott0_> console.log won't work in firefox?
[14:47:21] <shoky> sure will
[14:47:28] <Lorcat> shoky: Then tell me what I need to add. Shit.
[14:47:29] <Scott0_> it says the web console loggign API has been disabled by a script
[14:47:36] <Scott0_> I didn't tell it to disable anything
[14:47:42] <Scott0_> and in chrome the console works fine
[14:47:42] <shoky> Lorcat: i told you what you need to do, fuck.
[14:47:43] <Scott0_> wtf
[14:47:57] <Lorcat> shoky: I am not creating a fiddle for such a small problem
[14:48:05] <shoky> Lorcat: you said that already
[14:49:50] <Rinthe> how can i make masonry fit to width in a layout that has 1 fixed column and 1 fluid column? masonry being in the fluid column
[14:51:55] <Lorcat> Hola, I am getting an undefined error when I try to use jquery. I was wondering if you would take a look at my line please? (Por favor)
[14:51:58] <Lorcat> Do not reply shoky
[14:52:07] <Lorcat> $("#close_button").css( "margin-right", off_mright );
[14:52:14] <Lorcat> var off_mright is a string...

[14:52:52] <Atlantic777> What's hapening with jQuery mobile and redirections? In Django I have a Login form with a "next" field which should redirect user to the page from where he/she came. The problem is that when I include jQuery mobile in that html, something funny is happening instead of loading that new page from scratch.
[14:54:12] <shoky> dat_: what's the problem with that fiddle?
[14:55:14] <dat_> shoky: i just changed the code. run it again
[14:55:25] <Scott0_> does firefox have an issue parsing dates?
[14:55:39] <shoky> dat_: jsfiddle doesn't work like that
[14:55:54] <dat_> shoky: no matter what button user clicks, only the last function is called
[14:55:57] <shoky> dat_: update it and give a new link
[14:56:38] <dat_> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCwyX/4/
[14:57:05] <shoky> huh.
[14:57:06] <dat_> shoky: i have 3 forms, each with its own button and action url. however only the last action url is called no matter what button user clicks
[14:57:29] <shoky> you're including jquery and another script twice, for starters..
[14:57:43] <AlexMPS> Sweet, this channel seems active :D
[14:58:42] <dat_> shoky: is that the problem though?
[14:59:34] <guideX> is there some way of following the text cursor with a div
[14:59:51] <guideX> so something is floating above it, effectively hiding it
[15:00:17] <shoky> dat_: i donno what you're talking about. each button is triggering its own click handler just fine
[15:00:30] <shoky> dat_: and including scripts twice is usually a problem, yes
[15:00:45] <dat_> shoky: which one should I delete?
[15:00:47] <shoky> especially when one of those includes comes after some of your own code
[15:00:57] <shoky> the 2nd?
[15:02:13] <AlexMPS> Is it allowed to paste 3 short lines of close here if I require help or should I paste them somewhere else and pass the link?
[15:02:37] <shoky> AlexMPS: jsfiddle.net is best
[15:02:42] <AlexMPS> ok thanks
[15:02:50] <dat_> shoky: but after user clicks submit it just redirect to the 2nd action url
[15:03:06] <Mrgoose2> I have a multipage jquer mobile website.  How can i pass data between two pages?
[15:03:13] <dat_> shoky: i wrote <form action="/chargebronze" method="post"> but it doesn't go there
[15:03:36] <shoky> dat_  you're doing:  $('form').append($input).submit();
[15:03:47] <shoky> dat_:  $('form')  finds all forms in the page
[15:04:02] <dat_> shoky: ah i see. what is the fix you think?
[15:04:14] <shoky> you're doing that for both buttons
[15:04:24] <shoky> to reference the current form, i guess
[15:04:27] <shoky> not all forms
[15:05:44] <Scott0_> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Vpyxr/
[15:05:54] <Scott0_> works in chrome but NaN in firefox
[15:05:59] <Scott0_> I think it's a date issue
[15:06:20] <dat_> shoky: how do I reference current form?
[15:07:19] <shoky> dat_ one way is:  $('#customButton1').click(function(){ var form = $(this).closest('form'); .... })
[15:07:34] <AlexMPS> Hello, I have a grey image inside each li, on hove over the li, I want the image inside that li to add the class that removes the css filter. This is what I currently have, but it's not working like I want: http://jsfiddle.net/J78rG/
[15:07:44] <AlexMPS> sorry, the images won't load ;)
[15:08:24] <shoky> Scott0_ yes it's a date issue, you should pass in an ISO 8601 date string
[15:08:34] <Scott0_> I don't like ISO 8601
[15:09:54] <Scott0_> shoky: what's the proper format for that specific date?
[15:10:15] <Scott0_> seems close to the correct format
[15:11:01] <shoky> Scott0_: i think..  a T instead of the space. and a "Z" instead of " UTC"
[15:11:04] <Scott0_> or is there a way to convert to the proper format from there in JS?
[15:11:10] <Scott0_> regex?
[15:11:34] <shoky> adunno, people like moment.js for js date stuff
[15:11:58] <Scott0_> really?
[15:11:59] <eddiemonge> jquery for node? anyone done it? i know i should know better but im asking anyway
[15:12:03] <Scott0_> that massive script
[15:12:08] <Scott0_> for a single date?
[15:12:22] <jphase> eddiemonge: for the front-end sure, but not for the app side no ;]
[15:12:34] <eddiemonge> im asking for pure command line
[15:12:36] <Scott0_> 2013-10-07T03:58:00+00:00 isn't this correct?
[15:12:56] <jphase> eddiemonge: yeah, I've done it before on my first node app (to scrape content) but then quickly realized it's not advised as you already mentioned
[15:12:57] <Scott0_> oh nm
[15:12:59] <Scott0_> Z
[15:13:30] <Scott0_> shoky:  even with 2013-10-07T03:58:00Z im still gettign NaN
[15:13:38] <AlexMPS> Anyone willing to look at my problem? I'm guessing it's not that hard to do, I'm just out of ideas as I've tried a couple of things already
[15:14:06] <Scott0_> shoky: nm, had the UTC being added
[15:14:31] <shoky> yeh
[15:16:53] <eddiemonge> AlexMPS: what problem?
[15:17:44] <AlexMPS> I have a grey image inside each li (grey because of css filter) On hove of the li I want the image inside that li to get the class added that removes the filter
[15:17:54] <AlexMPS> hover*
[15:18:03] <AlexMPS> http://jsfiddle.net/J78rG/
[15:18:15] <AlexMPS> Images won't load on jsfiddle though
[15:18:52] <shoky> AlexMPS: it's removing the filter (if you include jquery)
[15:18:53] <slick-> guys, I'm trying to use media queries in ie8, for min-width etc, and I'm using a javascript like response.js or min-queries.js w/e
[15:18:58] <slick-> but i.e. 8 keeps freezing
[15:19:33] <AlexMPS> At the moment all the images in all of the li get the class added, not only the one where I hover over
[15:20:14] <shoky> AlexMPS: $("#software ul li img")   looks for ALL images matching that selector
[15:20:42] <Scott0_> shoky: any idea why date.str.replace(/\s/g, 'T'); isn't working?
[15:20:44] <shoky> you can use something more like $(this).find("img")
[15:20:54] <AlexMPS> I'll try, sec
[15:21:04] <shoky> Scott0_: if you fiddle it
[15:21:24] <Scott0_> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Vpyxr/4/
[15:21:33] <Scott0_> fiddle sounds so dirty
[15:21:47] <AlexMPS> Sweet, that works!
[15:21:55] <AlexMPS> Thanks shoky
[15:21:58] <shoky> Scott0_: mm what's date.str?
[15:22:02] <Scott0_> shoky: I know, its ugly
[15:22:08] <shoky> huh?
[15:22:33] <Scott0_> shoky: wait.. str is supposed to be the variable name isn't it?
[15:22:41] <shoky> it's your fiddle dude
[15:22:52] <Scott0_> shoky: got it from here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7151159/javascript-regular-expression-remove-spaces
[15:22:57] <Scott0_> str.replace(/\s/g,'')
[15:23:06] <Scott0_> nm
[15:23:07] <Scott0_> im dumb
[15:23:14] <Scott0_> running low on fuel
[15:23:19] <shoky> ;p
[15:24:10] <raj> shoky, you validate your form entries serverside as well, of course
[15:24:26] <raj> if you find a validation error, how do you like to report it?
[15:24:30] <shoky> raj w.w.what
[15:24:54] <raj> should I be super thorough and specific and send back to the client the exact fields that were troubling?
[15:25:03] <raj> or just a general FORM ERROR
[15:25:18] <raj> because technically, they somehow bypassed the clientside validation
[15:26:35] <shoky> if it's something you don't expect to happen too often.. it can be a general error i suppose
[15:26:53] <raj> ok
[15:27:08] <shoky> but that means you trust your clientside code :P
[15:27:17] <raj> I trust yours
[15:27:23] <shoky> lol
[15:27:30] <raj> and you trained me
[15:27:55] <raj> so if shit hits the fan, I'm giving you bad reviews on ratemyprofessor.com
[15:28:03] <shoky> well i didnt hand you any certificate yet
[15:28:25] <raj> i painted all you fences
[15:28:35] <raj> waxed your f**king cars
[15:28:52] <shoky> right, jobs for rookies
[15:29:25] <shoky> you may now order my groceries too
[15:29:26] <raj> you haven't seen me practice my canary kick on my own time
[15:30:28] <shoky> you're not asking enough shit on #ko.. ;[
[15:31:13] <Scott0_> shoky: also, date.replace(/\s/g, 'T'); won't work :P
[15:31:24] <Scott0_> shoky: firefox needed date = date.replace(/\s/g, 'T');
[15:31:27] <Scott0_> :(
[15:31:39] <raj> shoky, I need to start a side project to learn it
[15:31:52] <raj> can't implement it into my baby until I have some command of that library
[15:32:02] <shoky> Scott0_: ya replace returns a new string, same in chrome
[15:32:32] <shoky> strings are immutable
[15:32:48] <shoky> raj hmpf
[15:33:26] <Scott0_> immutable?
[15:33:38] <shoky> cannot be modified
[15:33:57] <Scott0_> oh nm only worked in chrome because it handled the date more flexibly
[15:34:10] <Scott0_> had a false sense of success there for a moment
[15:34:19] <Scott0_> shoky: thanks!
[15:34:26] <shoky> np!
[15:34:38] <heshanh_> hey guys, i need some help with the cycle 2 plugin. When the slides are moving it briefly shows the previous slide under the new slide. not sure if this  is a cSS or a JS issue
[15:34:48] <heshanh_> here the link, its on the home page http://gunnsgrowers.com
[15:43:53] <grafi> shoky is immutable
[15:44:46] <Rinthe> anyone know how i can make masonry fit to the size of the window when i resize the window? http://ericpaints.it/
[15:45:42] <grafi> Rinthe seems to me thats working quite well?
[15:46:14] <Rinthe> grafi: it's not i think you need to wait for it to fully finish loading and it breaks
[15:46:26] <grafi> yeah, just noticed that
[15:46:31] <grafi> slow internet is slow
[15:46:39] <Rinthe> could be the site ;p
[15:47:00] <grafi> nah its my connection here
[15:47:48] <Rinthe> any clues? i have both isFitWidth set to tru enad the bindResize method
[15:48:04] <grafi> Rinthe http://masonry.desandro.com/methods.html#bindresize what about this?
[15:48:08] <grafi> ha
[15:48:11] <grafi> :P
[15:48:13] <Rinthe> ya
[15:48:15] <Rinthe> i used it
[15:48:19] <grafi> hm
[15:48:34] <Rinthe> grafi: http://pastebin.com/pa4srSgi
[15:48:38] <Rinthe> not sure if i used it correctly?
[15:49:53] <grafi> me neither :p
[15:50:06] <Rinthe> lol
[15:51:27] <Rinthe> anyone else?
[15:58:45] <grafi> Rinthe try this http://pastebin.com/my6R9MJ0
[16:00:24] <Rinthe> grafi: bindResize isn't an option, according to the doc
[16:00:39] <grafi> is just ran that js on your page and it seemed to work
[16:00:47] <grafi> *I
[16:00:55] <Rinthe> hmm let me try
[16:01:01] <Rinthe> r u sure it finished loading? :p
[16:01:06] <grafi> jup
[16:01:07] <grafi> pretty
[16:01:07] <grafi> :P
[16:02:15] <Rinthe> grafi: it's not fitting to window
[16:02:38] <Rinthe> it stays the same if i resize
[16:03:13] <grafi> the amount of columns changes for me
[16:03:18] <grafi> when I rsize the window
[16:04:02] <guest________> Hi can anyone tell me how to append/prepend a text box selection? ex. I select "hi" in a text box and press a button and it makes it "<b>hi</b>".
[16:05:04] <Rinthe> grafi: I just updated to the latest masonry. seems to work now..
[16:05:11] <grafi> cool
[16:05:12] <grafi> :)
[16:05:20] <jphase> guest________: you'd have to use getSelection() for that
[16:07:50] <guest________> ok so i would do $(".boldBtn").click(function(){var temp = getSelection(); $(temp).append("</b>"); $(temp).prepend("<b>");});?
[16:08:21] <jphase> guest________: hmm, not quite
[16:08:24] <jphase> guest________: this example is doing something different than what you're trying to do (it wraps the selection with a <tag>selection</tag>), but you can see how you can iterate through the selection in lines 81-106 in this file:   https://github.com/jphase/wysiwyg/blob/master/js/wysiwyg.js
[16:10:03] <guest________> hum this is very confusing for me but your project is exactly what i am trying to make so atleast i now it is possible!
[16:10:19] <guest________> *know
[16:11:04] <jphase> hehe, well it's open source so feel free to take a gander and use it... it's only 2 days old though so it's still not perfect ;)
[16:12:04] <guest________> thanks for your help I will try some stuff. O.o its only two days old, thats when i had my idea to make something like it... Great minds think alike!
[16:13:07] <jphase> :D
[17:00:24] <bradmaxs> I am having trouble accessing my variable outside of the onload function in an each loop.  I thought each was sychronous but it is acting asynchronous. Maybe because f the image object? http://jsfiddle.net/XxrhA/
[17:01:27] <bradmaxs> Essentially I need to find out if there is any image_urls at the end of the each loop and then create some login if there are not but anytime I try and do that the logic after the loop executes before the loop.
[17:32:45] <jphase> unnu: how goes it bro?
[17:33:05] <unnu> goes well enough
[17:33:06] <unnu> working on
[17:33:07] <unnu> lol

[17:33:17] <unnu> class is so boring i want to cry
[17:33:36] <PhaseCode> kik
[17:33:37] <PhaseCode> lol
[17:33:47] <PhaseCode> thats why I don't want to take Comp Sci classes
[17:34:10] <unnu> spent 20 min trying to explain to this blond girl that a unordered list is not "just like a table"
[17:34:36] <unnu> and that you can't interchange <li> and <tr> just as you feel like it
[17:34:42] * unnu facepalms
[17:34:43] <PhaseCode> LOL
[17:34:45] <PhaseCode> LOOOOL
[17:34:51] <PhaseCode> Wait till dat css
[17:35:10] <unnu> just to be an ass
[17:35:19] <unnu> im submitting my HW assignments as .html files
[17:35:40] <PhaseCode> I can see someone submitting them as .txt
[17:35:42] <PhaseCode> going like
[17:35:47] <PhaseCode> ITS THE SAME THING RIGHT
[17:36:52] <jphase> lol unnu, I'm sorry man, sometimes it's best to just take those courses instead of challenging them though. Good for the self-esteem :D
[17:37:09] <unnu> lol
[17:37:11] <unnu> i guess
[17:37:30] * jphase fills unnu's glass to "half-full"
[17:37:38] <jphase> (with beer)
[17:37:39] <jphase> :D
[17:37:49] <PhaseCode> jphase: you employed?
[17:37:57] <jphase> PhaseCode: yesm
[17:38:20] <unnu> ughh
[17:38:25] <unnu> jphase, ive got some code for ya
[17:38:32] <PhaseCode> Front end/backend?
[17:38:32] <unnu> ill push it when i get this HW done
[17:38:34] <unnu> backend
[17:38:37] <unnu> oh
[17:38:38] <unnu> nvm
[17:39:04] <jphase> PhaseCode: both, and systems admin stuff, and graphic design, and proposal writing, and sales, and.......... *insert bullshit here*
[17:39:12] <PhaseCode> Ahh All in one
[17:39:15] <PhaseCode> same here :T
[17:39:19] <jphase> yeah, small company blues :\
[17:39:27] <PhaseCode> Stuck working in a law firm as the software engineer
[17:39:34] <PhaseCode> yea! Same here small company
[17:39:45] <jphase> ooo, custom software can be fun though, you get full reign
[17:40:11] <jphase> well, not all the time, but it CAN be fun that is hehe
[17:40:11] <PhaseCode> Mhmm, we use some open source software, but ATM I'm assigned to do some custom reporting
[17:40:29] <jphase> hmm, crystal reports?
[17:40:31] <PhaseCode> So Combinging MYSql/PHP/the whole lamp stack
[17:40:34] <jphase> oh k
[17:40:50] <PhaseCode> Yea, but I guess I'm excited for the graphs and stuff which will be HTML5
[17:41:09] <jphase> hmm, highcharts ftw?
[17:41:30] <jphase> or actual canvas charts?
[17:41:35] <PhaseCode> I actually didn't like Highcharts
[17:41:40] <PhaseCode> but actual canvas charts
[17:41:45] <PhaseCode> So I'll be writing my own wrappers
[17:42:17] <PhaseCode> and, I've got a JavaScriptCompressor Library to work on. Think minify but better
[17:43:34] <jphase> nice, I want to get into canvas charts... I've done a butt-load of customization to highcharts before so I'm pretty familiar with it, but there's some nuances that I didn't like about them for sure
[17:43:50] <StanAccy> Im trying to position a popup div just below the link that was clicked.  My parent container has relative positioning. All the stack overflow answers Ive seen dont seem to address this problem - how do I get the location of the clicked item?
[17:43:54] * jphase is kind of interested in Google Charts
[17:44:25] <jphase> StanAccy: .scrollTop() ?
[17:44:40] <PhaseCode> A lot of math, especially pie charts
[17:45:08] <StanAccy> jphase: Is there no way to obtain the position of the element that was clicked, grab its height, and then +10 so I can set top: ? (ditto for the left)
[17:45:33] <jphase> StanAccy: you should be able to, normally I use margins for that though instead of left and top positions
[17:45:55] <jphase> StanAccy: do you need to use left and top specifically?
[17:46:13] <StanAccy> jphase: Nope - I just want to posisiont a popup div just below the link that was clicked that triggered the popup to open
[17:47:34] <jphase> oic
[17:47:57] <jphase> StanAccy: is the link you clicked relative?
[17:48:51] <StanAccy> I have a container, position:relative.  Within that container I have a button, floated right.  When the user clicks the button, I want to popup a div just below the clicked button.
[17:49:50] <jphase> StanAccy: k, so floated right implies it's relative. you should be able to do something like:  $('a.myLink').click(function(){ $('.myPopup').css('top', $(this).scrollTop()); });
[17:50:22] <jphase> StanAccy: a bit hard to tell without seeing it for sure but if I understand you correctly, I think that should work
[17:51:36] <jphase> unnu: I removed that function you added for adding the index, but I just added a new one back in that I think should work well. Pushing now.
[17:51:58] <unnu> aight
[17:52:03] <unnu> i need a smoke
[17:52:07] <StanAccy> jphase: just testing - its lookig much better.
[17:52:40] <StanAccy> ok, that fixes the vertical alignment - what about horizontal?
[17:53:20] <StanAccy> Ill put together a jfiddle
[17:53:23] <PhaseCode> unnu: smoke a bowl!~
[17:53:46] <PhaseCode> jphase: are you hourly?
[17:54:06] <jphase> PhaseCode: yeah, which is good for when I'm over worked
[17:54:24] <jphase> StanAccy: .scrollLeft
[17:54:29] <jphase> same thing but with that :)
[17:54:44] <jphase> you can even put that in your same .css call
[17:55:00] <PhaseCode> jphase: same, 80 hours a week for the last 3 weeks or so
[17:55:07] <jphase> ouch, been there
[17:55:30] <jphase> PhaseCode: right now it's luckily a bit slower (or at least I'm not caring about the work load). Sometimes it's more like a surgeon though, yeah
[17:58:07] <jphase> unnu: we've got an incremental id on the wysiwyg_content div now so we should be able to tie in our AJAX now if you want to pull
[17:58:14] <unnu> aight
[17:58:18] <unnu> go go gadget github
[17:58:26] <jphase> :D
[17:59:10] <jphase> unnu: oh woops, left some defaults in there in the index file that make only 2 of the buttons show up with red font color (to show you how extendable our plugin is), you can remove that.
[17:59:22] <unnu> aight
[17:59:52] <jphase> on my way to a conference, be on a bit l8r. <3
[17:59:57] <unnu> where is this repo at now?
[18:00:00] <unnu> awww
[18:05:59] <StanAccy> Anyone assist with this: http://jsfiddle.net/UDuyG/28/
[18:06:18] <StanAccy> Im trying to place the popup div just below the button that was clicked
[18:06:31] <PhaseCode> under it?
[18:06:34] <PhaseCode> like?
[18:07:03] <StanAccy> like 10pxunder the button
[18:07:24] <StanAccy> right now it appears way over on the left, and Ive been trying to set the left and top params using css() to position the popup div
[18:10:01] <PhaseCode> hmm
[18:10:02] <PhaseCode> 1 sec
[18:13:18] <ezrafree> hey all
[18:13:59] <ezrafree> i can't think of anywhere else to ask this so, can anyone tell me where the best channel to ask a question about tinymce might be?
[18:17:08] <PhaseCode> 10 px under?
[18:17:08] <doug65536> This returns two elements: $('article').find('div[data-editor=preview] iframe').  why doesn't this ever get any events: $('article').on('load', 'div[data-editor=preview iframe' ...
[18:17:18] <doug65536> oops
[18:17:26] <doug65536> This returns two elements: $('article').find('div[data-editor=preview] iframe').  why doesn't this ever get any events: $('article').on('load', 'div[data-editor=preview] iframe' ...
[18:18:07] <PhaseCode> StanAccy: you here?
[18:19:19] <StanAccy> yes
[18:19:42] <StanAccy> PhaseCode: just some px's under the clicked button/element
[18:19:46] <PhaseCode> http://jsfiddle.net/UDuyG/29/ there you guy
[18:19:49] <PhaseCode> go*
[18:20:37] <StanAccy> PhaseCode: Thanks.  Ok, a couple of follow up questions for 200...
[18:20:58] <StanAccy> is there a way to replace the $('#button') selectors with a ref to the parent/bound click handler ?
[18:21:02] <PhaseCode> yea
[18:21:22] <StanAccy> and for 400.... can I check to see if the popped up div scrolls out of view, and if so, shift if left to accomodate?
[18:21:43] <PhaseCode> So see if the button is not in view?
[18:21:52] <PhaseCode> Oh oh
[18:21:53] <PhaseCode> hmm.
[18:21:56] <StanAccy> no - if you look at the current popup (your version)
[18:22:41] <StanAccy> half of it is obscured.  Is it possible to say: if calculated left + div width > something, then shift left side back by the diff of something-(left+div width)
[18:23:22] <PhaseCode> Yea
[18:23:45] <PhaseCode> However, I have to leave to go get the gf from work
[18:24:05] <StanAccy> a much more important task! Thanks for the help
[18:24:18] <PhaseCode> No problem, I hope that helps you get a start.
[18:24:25] <StanAccy> it does
[18:24:28] <StanAccy> one quick Q:
[18:24:38] <StanAccy> does $(this) refer to the element the click handler was bound on?
[18:25:07] <PhaseCode> no I actually think $(this) in the css referes doesnt refer to the button
[18:25:13] <PhaseCode> does refer to the button*
[18:25:19] <PhaseCode> no no, it doesnt
[18:25:20] <PhaseCode> lol
[18:25:38] <StanAccy> so what is 'this' inside that function then?
[18:27:20] <PhaseCode> well you can't have 'this' inside the .css({[code]})
[18:27:37] <PhaseCode> Ugh don't have time to debug :T
[18:28:26] <StanAccy> no probs
[18:43:48] <graphettion> I'm having trouble with this jQuery slideshow. I have the content how I want it to look but not sure how to program it in exactly. Any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/tGaWV/
[18:44:23] <graphettion> I'd like the content to slide back and forth each time.
[18:57:42] <doug65536> I found my answer. load events don't bubble
[19:01:28] <hooligan132> hey
[19:01:46] <hooligan132> any one got experiences with xmlhttprequest ?
[19:05:18] <MeMReS> graphettion: ever play with GreenSock JS ?
[19:05:36] <graphettion> nope
[19:05:42] <graphettion> looking...
[19:07:36] <MeMReS> Is you mind blown yet?
[19:07:47] <MeMReS> *your
[19:09:24] <graphettion> Is there a search or navigation?
[19:10:35] <graphettion> Oh, I see what it is. A framework to help the framework, right?
[19:31:51] <imzhi> looklook
[19:52:06] <tclo> test
[19:55:59] <raj> what if I want to `return $.Deferred().promise()` and a value?
[19:56:52] <raj> nm, .resolve() takes the returned arguments I think
[20:23:45] <raj> Is `$(this)['before'](message)` okay to do?
[20:24:04] <raj> it's actually `$(this)[options.how](message)` within a jquery plugin
[20:27:29] <gnarf> yeah, dot notation or square bracket doesn't matter much unless you're using closure compiler ;)
[20:27:59] <gnarf> though i would suggest making sure options.how can only be valid
[20:28:23] <gnarf> or even more like options.before ? 'before' : 'after'
[20:28:55] <raj> interesting
[20:29:01] <raj> thanks
[20:44:47] <__machine> is it not possible at all to do a cross origin POST in IE8? Is the only solution to create a same origin proxy?
[21:25:28] <RonWhoCares> after I remove the <select> options with $('select > option').remove(); how do I re-add them where the output is HTML ( ie <option value="1">Name</option> ) --- the <select is:   <select id="note_history_page_select">
[21:26:53] <jphase> RonWhoCares: try   $('#note_history_page_select > option').remove();   and then    $('#note_history_page_select').append($('<option>').prop('value', 1));
[21:27:03] <jphase> oh woops
[21:27:11] <jphase> you need the .text('Name') in there too btw
[21:27:23] <RonWhoCares> can you show me it all together
[21:27:32] <PhaseCode> Hey jphase!
[21:27:43] <jphase> RonWhoCares: $('#note_history_page_select > option').remove();    and then    $('#note_history_page_select').append($('<option>').prop('value', 1).text('Name'));
[21:27:47] <jphase> hi PhaseCode :)
[21:28:13] <PhaseCode> You left right before I could have asked what convention your heading too lol\
[21:29:12] <RonWhoCares> jphase: The list of options is generated by PHP with a database query.  The output in PHP is a list of <option value="#">Value</opton>   x several rows
[21:29:48] <jphase> oh haha, just a scalable WP convention on the best ways to tune a server for high volume WP sites here in Portland
[21:30:32] <PhaseCode> Ahh! I'm debating attending devbeat
[21:30:42] <PhaseCode> Seeing if my company will pay to fly me out
[21:30:46] <jphase> RonWhoCares: So are you needing to repopulate the options based on server calculations or something?
[21:30:51] <PhaseCode> Living in vegas and what not.
[21:31:17] <RonWhoCares> jpshase correct
[21:31:57] <jphase> RonWhoCares: you'll need to use an AJAX method then that will send some params to your server-side script that will then return some sort of data (*cough* JSON FTW *cough*) and then build your options based on that response :D
[21:33:11] <jphase> PhaseCode: oic, yeah I attend a lot of various local conferences from meetup.com. There's a pretty tight-niched dev community in Portland so I get the benefit of a lot of nerdy folk donating their time.
[21:34:22] <PhaseCode> Well then~ I hav to check out meetup for vegas! I need to get out there
[21:36:49] <PhaseCode> I need to not feel stagnated :(
[21:41:15] <jphase> Cork: (or any oop jQuery plugin nerd), I would greatly appreciate some consult on the best way to create a callback function in the current strict wrapper that I'm using. Any schooling on reworking my plugin in general would also be appreciated.  P.S..... <3 you long time
[21:41:34] * jphase preps a link
[21:43:41] <jphase> https://github.com/jphase/wysiwyg/blob/master/js/wysiwyg.js
[21:45:33] <PhaseCode> jphase wysiwyg for js?
[21:46:12] <jphase> PhaseCode: yeah, front-end wysiwyg editor that doesn't suck and allows developers to pwn anything native (CSS, HTML, callback events, etc.)... that's the goal anyhow
[21:46:40] * jphase is currently working on CRUD events and keybinding atm
[21:47:56] <jphase> well, maybe just the "U" in CRUD I suppose :\
[21:51:12] <PhaseCode> CRUD?
[21:52:13] <jphase> Create/Read/Update/Delete
[21:52:31] <jphase> (the 4 basic server-side SQL-esk commands) :D
[21:52:39] <doug65536> jphase: no search? :)
[21:52:58] <jphase> hah, touché doug65536, care to pwn me for a sec?? :D
[21:54:42] <doug65536> jphase: there are two ways to do something like callbacks: actual callbacks, and triggering events
[21:55:03] <PhaseCode> Oh okay xD
[21:55:35] <jphase> doug65536: actual callbacks != custom events then I assume?  like... not $('div').on('poops', function(){ console.log('sharts'); }); ?
[21:55:49] <doug65536> jphase: that is an actual callback
[21:56:02] <jphase> oh okay, sweet, I feel better about myself then!
[21:56:09] <jphase> however, I still am a nub..... so......
[21:56:20] <doug65536> but you could use trigger('something.myPluginName') to trigger events
[21:56:28] <jphase> ohhh right
[21:56:31] <jphase> I see what you mean now
[21:56:37] <doug65536> the user of the plugin can listen for them like browser events, with .on
[21:56:46] <PhaseCode> god you guys make me feel even more noob
[21:59:10] <jphase> doug65536: so basically I need to attach my event to the particular element as I create it (i.e. on line 25 in my link?)
[21:59:36] <jphase> doug65536: do you see anything painfully nubbish in my plugin then? like... "dude... return _______ or die kthxbye" ?
[21:59:51] <doug65536> ouch, you are setting an id?
[21:59:54] <doug65536> why?
[21:59:59] <jphase> well, just added that
[22:00:14] <jphase> as numerical index, but then I thought of attaching custom events
[22:00:17] <jphase> so I don't need that anymore
[22:00:32] <jphase> I'm currently trying to avoid that
[22:00:37] <doug65536> jphase: use namespaced data if you want to store something in an event
[22:00:56] <doug65536> something.data('someName.myPluginName', someValue)
[22:01:00] <jphase> doug65536: that's EXACTLY what I need to learn. I know this very well in PHP but this part I can't figure out
[22:01:02] <jphase> ohhhhh
[22:01:03] <jphase> srsly?
[22:01:10] <jphase> that simple?...... okay.......
[22:01:25] <doug65536> and to read it back, something.data('someName.myPluginName')
[22:01:35] <doug65536> I'm using myPluginName as a placeholder of course
[22:01:54] <doug65536> same with any events you attach in your plugin
[22:02:14] <doug65536> if you attached an on-click, you would do .on('click.myPluginName', ...)
[22:02:34] <jphase> gotcha
[22:02:38] <jphase> so event.namespace
[22:02:45] <doug65536> so if the person using your plugin does anything aggressive, like .off('click') it won't break your plugin
[22:02:46] <doug65536> yes
[22:02:48] <jphase> omfg so cool!!!!!
[22:03:36] <jphase> doug65536++;
[22:03:46] <jtm> How can I select a parent to an element that DOES NOT have a particular class? I tried: "a.page-link:parent(:not(.active))"
[22:03:54] <doug65536> say you wanted to provide a way to "shutdown" your plugin - remove its functionality with an "off" command, you could do .off('.myPluginName') and it would remove all YOUR events
[22:04:01] <TTomiK> anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/ErzE4/
[22:04:27] <jtm> I want to select all elements that match the fact that their parent doesn't have a certain class.
[22:04:37] <doug65536> your event handlers*
[22:05:35] <jphase> jtm: $(':not(.parentclass) > a')   =   anchor tags that have a parent that don't have a class of "parentclass"
[22:05:49] <jtm> Ah thank you!
[22:05:55] <jphase> np
[22:05:57] <doug65536> jphase: also, there is rarely any need to set an id or worry about being able to find elements with a selector, simply store a reference to the element somewhere (in .data, or somewhere) and that reference will refer to that element
[22:06:34] <jphase> doug65536: thank you very much for the lesson! this is a very hard thing to google without going through endless blogs!!!
[22:06:53] <doug65536> yes, it's hard to find a lot of plugin authoring stuff
[22:07:16] <jphase> TTomiK: start by including jQuery on the page on the "Frameworks & Extensions" section on the top left of jsfiddle
[22:07:46] <TTomiK> jphase: it's just copypaste, it isn't supposed to work in jsfiddle (it also uses twitter bootstrap)
[22:08:06] <jphase> oh, hmm blind debugging is tough :(
[22:08:19] <TTomiK> :(
[22:08:19] <jphase> tougher*
[22:08:29] <jphase> more tough?    </rant>
[22:09:07] <jphase> TTomiK: well if it's not going to work in jsfiddle, how about you help us by telling us what's wrong :D
[22:09:28] <TTomiK> I wrote it in comment
[22:09:39] <jphase> oh... /facepalm
[22:09:59] <TTomiK> row is a div that includes brand_model and model_code
[22:10:05] <TTomiK> there can be multiple rows
[22:10:07] <doug65536> TTomiK: what do you want to do?
[22:11:06] <TTomiK> I'm trying to think how to explain this quickly... we went through this the whole day yesterday with a user called Stephen here :)
[22:11:34] <doug65536> TTomiK: "select a parent to an element that does not have a partitular class"... do you mean, look through the parents or do you mean siblings of the parent? or what
[22:12:22] <jphase> oh I think that might've been jtm
[22:12:33] <doug65536> TTomiK: oops
[22:12:36] <doug65536> jtm: ^^^
[22:12:40] <doug65536> jphase: thanks
[22:13:03] <TTomiK> here are the typeahead options too http://jsfiddle.net/tomikulmala/2APLr/
[22:13:58] <doug65536> jtm: you want to find the direct child of all of the elements that don't have a particular class in a set of elements?
[22:14:18] <doug65536> jtm: ah nevermind lol
[22:14:25] <doug65536> jphase: lol you already answered him
[22:14:28] <doug65536> I should sleep
[22:14:33] * jphase >.<
[22:14:37] <TTomiK> doug65536: anyway... the idea is this: I have an input with class brand_model and model_code. model_code has typeahead attached into it and I need to send brand_model as a parameter to server so typeahead can give me proper suggestions
[22:16:10] <TTomiK> doug65536: the problem is, I don't know how to access brand_model value from typeahead options. Then stephen helped me with the code and now the brand_model -value is passed to model_code's parameter, but it gives me the error I wrote to the comments
[22:16:30] <doug65536> TTomiK: which typeahead? the old one, or a recent typeahead.js
[22:16:41] <TTomiK> 2.
[22:17:00] <TTomiK> I have to use it as the theme I'm using has been written on twitter bs 2
[22:17:07] <xinming> var new_array = $('.class').map(function () { return $(this).attr('id') });   <--- In this example the new array is not able to be used in $.param method in jqueyr
[22:17:31] <xinming> and when I check the console in firebug, It prints Object[ ]   instead of  [ ]
[22:17:55] <xinming> So, how to make $('.class').map(function () { ... } )  returns a true array instead please?
[22:18:13] <doug65536> TTomiK: wouldn't it be easiest for you to do your ajax request and in the ajax done handler populate the typeahead values?
[22:19:10] <wort_hall> jphase: hello. I have to canvas tags on one .html. One for the animated logo. and one for a small draw app.
[22:19:19] <doug65536> TTomiK: otherwise, use a source: function(query, process) { $.post(...., function(data) { process(data.optionArray); })
[22:19:31] <doug65536> TTomiK: pass an object to .typeahead
[22:19:34] <wort_hall> jphase: I id'd one "myCanvas" and "myCanvas2"
[22:19:56] <wort_hall> jphase: problem is only the draw app shows and the animated logo does not.
[22:20:29] <jphase> wort_hall: hmm, did you try using .append() instead of .html()  (and also making jQuery DOM objects inside your append?)
[22:20:30] <doug65536> TTomiK: what is product_brand_typeahead_options ?
[22:20:36] <jop008> I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/51/ I can only see part of the screen
[22:20:41] <doug65536> TTomiK: is there a source callback in there?
[22:21:21] <jphase> wort_hall: something like.... $('.myclass').append($('<canvas>').attr({foo: 'bar'}));   (but with real values in the .attr)?
[22:23:03] <wort_hall> jphase: let me create a simplified fiddle to show you my situation.
[22:23:15] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/51/show/ will show the complet page
[22:23:15] <jphase> sure thing
[22:23:56] <Libin> I have a set of radio buttons in my form, even when i select a radio button my jquery validation does not recognise it been selected
[22:24:10] <Libin> any tips please
[22:24:39] <doug65536> Libin: invalid html, duplicate id? show code to get something better than guesses
[22:25:24] <doug65536> Libin: it can still look ok with valid html, but elements can't be reached from js
[22:25:31] <doug65536> invalid*
[22:26:11] <Libin> doug : its done in razor, is that ok?
[22:26:36] <TTomiK> doug65536: there is
[22:26:42] <Libin> http://pastebin.com/Hv6r4ssu
[22:26:47] <Libin> thats my code
[22:27:01] <TTomiK> doug65536: you don't have to worry about product_brand_typeahead, it works as supposed
[22:27:18] <doug65536> TTomiK: what?
[22:27:32] <TTomiK> doug65536: the one and only problem is how to get brand_model to model_code -typeahead
[22:27:32] <doug65536> TTomiK: you want to pass information to the callback right?
[22:27:56] <doug65536> TTomiK: exactly, which is why you can't define the source callback outside that scope
[22:28:30] <doug65536> just cut that callback out of that object, and use $.extend to add source to it and pass that to typeahead
[22:28:57] <TTomiK> doug65536: you lost me there, i've never extended anything, sorry
[22:29:06] <TTomiK> ( in jquery )
[22:29:20] <doug65536> TTomiK: $.extend lets you add properties to an object easily
[22:29:29] <TTomiK> oh
[22:29:48] <TTomiK> so what should I extend?
[22:30:14] <TTomiK> the brand_model -value should be fetched just before the $.ajax in model_code -options is sent
[22:30:47] <doug65536> so if your options object has everything except source: function() ...  then you can do var options = $.extend({}, that_options_object, { source: function(query,process) { ... do your ajax using the model code etc... call process(theResultArray); }})
[22:31:09] <doug65536> then call typeahead with options
[22:31:23] <doug65536> TTomiK: hold on, I'll show example
[22:31:58] <TTomiK> cool, thanks
[22:36:39] <doug65536> TTomiK: ah, I see what you're trying to do, you are trying to narrow down model code based on brand model value?
[22:37:01] <TTomiK> doug65536: exactly! You're the first one to get that :)
[22:37:51] <TTomiK> doug65536: that's why I need to send brand_model to server with model_code -suggestion query
[22:38:45] <doug65536> TTomiK: it would help if I could see the source: callback
[22:39:26] <TTomiK> it's there in the fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/2APLr/)...
[22:39:28] <doug65536> TTomiK: any reason you don't just read the input field, or have an object that is in scope to both places and set the value on change
[22:39:52] <doug65536> TTomiK: no I mean the typeahead callback. you are using source: right?
[22:40:07] <TTomiK> doug65536: source, yes
[22:40:48] <TTomiK> doug65536: I'm not sure what you mean if not that source from product_model_code_typeahead_options ?
[22:40:59] <doug65536> TTomiK: ah, and there are several rows, and you want to look at the current rows model value, right?
[22:41:07] <TTomiK> yes
[22:41:27] <TTomiK> doug65536: that's why the inputs don't have IDs
[22:42:18] <doug65536> TTomiK: how many of these rows?
[22:42:41] <doug65536> TTomiK: ah I see, it's an add row button
[22:43:03] <doug65536> TTomiK: ok, well, since I can't see your ajax, I'll make one up
[22:43:10] <doug65536> TTomiK: one moment
[22:44:45] <TTomiK> doug65536: sorry for the delay, people walking by and have stuff to ask :)
[22:44:57] <TTomiK> doug65536: there can be multiple rows, no limit
[22:49:32] <doug65536> TTomiK: you don't need that keyup right? that was an attempt to forward the information?
[22:50:31] <wort_hall> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/JErwQ/ for some reason now the draw app will not work upon transferring code to the fiddle.
[22:52:10] <doug65536> TTomiK: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ErzE4/1/
[22:52:30] <doug65536> TTomiK: it passes the row as a 3rd parameter to the source callback
[22:52:47] <doug65536> TTomiK: in there you can do your scoped selector like $("input.product_brand_model",divPDR);
[22:53:36] <doug65536> TTomiK: basically, each row's typeahead options object gets a wrapper around the source function that gives it the row as a 3rd parameter
[22:54:09] <doug65536> TTomiK: typo fix http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ErzE4/2/
[22:56:22] <doug65536> TTomiK: with my proposed change, you can read whatever you like from that row in the source callback
[22:56:45] <doug65536> s
[22:58:07] <jphase> wort_hall: you don't happen to have a working copy of this live do you? I can't troubleshoot the canvas fail if it doesn't work to begin with on teh fiddlez :[
[22:58:09] <doug65536> I actually didn't need to see your ajax. I just provided the source callback with a reference to the row
[22:59:00] <wort_hall> jphase: Is it okay if I put what I have so far live?
[22:59:43] <jphase> wort_hall: sure?
[22:59:59] <doug65536> yay browser prefixes :|
[23:01:19] <TTomiK> doug65536: I'll take a look, again sorry for the delay
[23:07:55] <TTomiK> doug65536: I have a question, why do you extend product_brand_typeahead?
[23:08:11] <doug65536> TTomiK: to make a separate instance of the object
[23:08:25] <doug65536> otherwise it would all end up with the value of the last one
[23:08:29] <TTomiK> ok
[23:08:54] <doug65536> TTomiK: $.extend({}, something) essentially clones something
[23:09:08] <TTomiK> doug65536: ok
[23:09:40] <TTomiK> doug65536: so... how do I now get a hold of the brand_model value in $.ajax ?
[23:10:00] <doug65536> TTomiK: I made it pass one more parameter to the source callback: the row
[23:10:04] <jop008> Anyone an idea why I don't see the 3th column?
[23:10:09] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/52/show/
[23:10:29] <doug65536> so make your source callback take another parameter (divPDR) and use $("input.product_brand_model",divPDR) or whatever
[23:10:41] <doug65536> .val()
[23:10:41] <b-ot> doug65536: for form fields
[23:12:26] <TTomiK> doug65536: Awesome! It works! Thank you so much :)
[23:12:30] <doug65536> TTomiK: in other words, your source: callback should look like: function(query, process, divPDR) { var model = $('input.product_brand_model', divPDR);  ... do ajax, you have model
[23:12:33] <doug65536> TTomiK: np
[23:12:36] <TTomiK> doug65536: but I still have a question ;)
[23:12:56] <TTomiK> doug65536: How to get the first row to work? It's output from a php view
[23:13:24] <TTomiK> I have to learn about extending some more, because I've needed this earlier too :)
[23:13:28] <doug65536> TTomiK: I'll refactor it out so you can call it to make a wrapper for that row too
[23:13:39] <TTomiK> nice
[23:16:51] <doug65536> TTomiK: you should be able to use wrapTypeaheadSource to setup a wrapper for the php generated row http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ErzE4/3/
[23:17:49] <TTomiK> doug65536: that's cleaner too, reusing code is always nice
[23:17:59] <doug65536> TTomiK: yes
[23:18:36] <doug65536> TTomiK: renamed variable name I missed http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ErzE4/4/

[23:22:11] <wort_hall> jphase: this really sucks. the college lab I'm in for some reason I can't ftp to the server hosting my site. :( using win_scp.
[23:22:41] <jphase> wort_hall: zip and email to me and I'll run it locally
[23:30:02] <TTomiK> doug65536: really nice, I'd have never thought of $.extend
[23:39:08] <bluemner> hey guys guten Morgen :) Im kind of new to query and am still stumbling on the syntax can someone please take a look at my code ? basically what I'm trying to do is in the switch statement to return false if a textfield is in focus. Im doing this because we have a kind of foto player on our site which uses the spacebar to turn on and of, the problem is when you are trying to fill out the form and use the spacebar it doesnt work well it does but 
[23:39:08] <bluemner> in the way I need it :) ill just post the part of the switch statement. I'm using (jq("textarea).focusin because the other coder has done this throughout the code :)
[23:39:09] <bluemner> https://pastee.org/5cnj8
[23:41:50] <bluemner> its just one switch statement you would really make my day thanx
[23:43:29] <Red_Onyx> anyone used anything like this?   window.localStorage.setItem('rows', JSON.stringify(jsArray) ); ?
[23:44:05] <bluemner> nope sorry
[23:46:12] <doug65536> Red_Onyx: yes
[23:47:11] <doug65536> bluemner: try if (self.is(':focus'))
[23:48:25] <bluemner> doug thanks and keep the rest? is the syntax all right?
[23:48:59] <doug65536> bluemner: why do you attach an event handler to every textarea on the page?
[23:49:02] <bluemner> do I put text area:focus
[23:49:09] <funhouse> Is anyone using the jqueryui spinner?
[23:49:22] <bluemner> ok that sounds pretty clever
[23:49:36] <bluemner> ill try that but does the other way not work?
[23:49:54] <doug65536> bluemner: depends on how you define "work"
[23:50:24] <doug65536> bluemner: that code adds more and more event handlers to every textarea on the whole page
[23:50:41] <doug65536> bluemner: every keypress adds another event handler to every textarea
[23:50:47] <bluemner> ok lol I c and that makes everything slower eventually ?
[23:50:51] <funhouse> anyone?
[23:51:33] <doug65536> bluemner: yes much slower. what is that return false supposed to do?
[23:51:49] <bluemner> doug ok thanks ill try that maybe your still here then maybe you can take a look at the code
[23:52:18] <bluemner> the return false is send to the event so that the keybinding doesnt work for the spacebar
[23:52:44] <doug65536> bluemner: well, it won't do that. it will return false as it handles the focusin event
[23:52:54] <doug65536> bluemner: that return has nothing to do with the keydown
[23:53:24] <bluemner> aha ok strange I hate that code I think 20 people have been sitting at it and thats the problem
[23:54:07] <bluemner> Ah maybe its because I just send a bit of the code lol your missing lots of it
[23:54:12] <funhouse> Does anyone have a good spinner plugin that actually works?
[23:54:25] <funhouse> jqueryui sucks
[23:54:41] <doug65536> bluemner: no. what do you think jq("textarea").focusin(function(event) { return false; })  does
[23:54:57] <bluemner> https://pastee.org/5cnj8
[23:55:04] <bluemner> this is the whole script
[23:55:30] <doug65536> bluemner: you didn't copy the url, it's the same paste
[23:55:47] <bluemner> I thought first it checks if any text areas are in focus if yes it sends else to the event
[23:55:55] <bluemner> oh sorry
[23:56:04] <bluemner> https://pastee.org/mees4
[23:58:03] <doug65536> bluemner: this is how you see if something is focused http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/mtZyQ/
[23:58:56] <funhouse> Anyone know where I can get help with jqueryui?
[23:59:03] <doug65536> funhouse: here
[23:59:24] <funhouse> doug65536: ok great, would love to know why spinners don't update the max value when setting the option.
[23:59:27] <doug65536> funhouse: I would use the font-awesome spinner
[23:59:38] <funhouse> $( "#el" ).spinner('option', { max: 10000 });
[23:59:40] <doug65536> funhouse: oh that kind of spinner
