[03:03:11] <Guest81621> ,
[04:59:17] <Dorian-Grim> $('div+input') why does this not work?
[05:01:10] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: make a jsfiddle with the dom structure you're trying to work with
[05:01:37] <Dorian-Grim> they are siblings
[05:01:48] <Dorian-Grim> I think the + is wrong. Do I need ~?
[05:02:23] <Dorian-Grim> div+input works in css
[05:03:23] <Cork> again make a jsfiddle so we can see the relation
[05:04:50] <Dorian-Grim> https://jsfiddle.net/t244o0h2/
[05:06:57] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: you forgot to add jquery https://jsfiddle.net/t244o0h2/1/
[05:07:10] <Cork> (in the javascript section)
[05:07:15] <Cork> except for that it works fine
[05:07:54] <Dorian-Grim> it does here
[05:08:06] <Dorian-Grim> It doesn't in my page
[05:08:07] <Dorian-Grim> wtf...
[05:08:08] <Cork> so again reproduce the dom structure you're working with
[05:08:16] <Cork> that is most likely the problem
[05:19:51] <joaocastanho> Hello. I want to do something like this. Open the website in popup check if user is logged in that website, if not they should login. After that I need to show a share button
[05:22:30] <Cork> joaocastanho: is the login page on the same domain?
[05:22:47] <joaocastanho> different domains
[05:22:55] <Cork> then you can't
[05:23:06] <Cork> that requires xss and the browser will block you
[05:23:17] <joaocastanho> oh :(
[05:23:17] <joaocastanho> really?
[05:23:23] <joaocastanho> damn
[05:23:28] <joaocastanho> they're both my websites
[05:23:32] <Cork> yes, its to prevent exactly what you're trying to do (leak login information)
[05:23:49] <Cork> well you could add an json or jsonp api and just query that
[05:24:22] <Cork> (if you go json you need to add cors header to the response)
[05:24:41] <joaocastanho> My goal is to popup a share button if user is logged in that website, if they aren't they should login and then the share button will show.
[05:24:52] <joaocastanho> like a reward system
[05:25:18] <Cork> ya, and to do that you need to get the login state cross domains
[05:25:47] <joaocastanho> so cors?
[05:25:51] <Cork> the best option for that is to either use an iframe and let it all work remotely (no involvement with the current domain
[05:26:03] <Cork> or provide an api that allow cross domain communication
[05:26:19] <Cork> Cross Origin Request
[05:26:34] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[05:26:49] <joaocastanho> Cork, but that iframe will need to have the share button, but that button isn't included in the other website, you know?
[05:27:10] <Cork> joshtau: ya, you would have to make a specific page for the feature (on the other server)
[05:27:27] <Cork> you will have to add special code there what ever route you choose
[05:27:31] <joaocastanho> I see
[05:27:44] <Cork> as what you're trying to do is a security risk
[05:28:17] <joaocastanho> ah, it will be too risky though?
[05:29:04] <Cork> it isn't risky if you write the code to except third parties to also try to use the info
[05:29:17] <Cork> so make sure you validate that the origin of the request is your other domain
[05:29:26] <joaocastanho> so I should make it to just work for the domain I'm using
[05:29:28] <Cork> else you risk leaking user info
[05:29:32] <joaocastanho> right?
[05:29:32] <Cork> yes
[05:29:49] <joaocastanho> I see
[05:30:03] <joaocastanho> would it be too hard to implement this?
[05:30:09] <Cork> or if you go the iframe route you don't need to open up anything
[05:30:27] <joaocastanho> I do need a popup though
[05:30:30] <Cork> if you go the iframe route you only need to add a server page that either show the form or a like button
[05:30:47] <Cork> well popup might be a problem
[05:31:06] <joaocastanho> ah
[05:31:09] <Cork> if you want the like button in the popup it is possible
[05:31:19] <Cork> else you need cors scripting
[05:32:01] <Cork> the point is, the page you send the user from
[05:32:14] <Cork> can't get any info about the page you're sending them to
[05:32:20] <joaocastanho> I need the share button in the popup, but first I need to check if he's logged in so I can reward him
[05:32:23] <Cork> without cors
[05:32:40] <Cork> all that could be done on the other domain
[05:32:59] <Cork> so ya, window.open(url-to-other-sites-special-page) is all you need
[05:33:34] <joaocastanho> Okay, cool. What about to check if they're shared so I would only tell them again in 1 hour?
[05:33:37] <Cork> it's also the safest as you don't losen the security at all
[05:33:48] <Cork> ...
[05:33:54] <Cork> why make the site horrible to use?
[05:34:20] <Cork> the more i hear of this the worse it sounds...
[05:34:52] <joaocastanho> I would like to do it
[05:34:52] <Cork> anyway the answer is the saem
[05:34:54] <Cork> *same
[05:35:10] <Cork> you can't know what they did without having access to that domains data
[05:35:13] <Cork> and that is cors
[05:35:53] <Cork> (also note most browser will most likely block the popup with there popup blockers)
[05:36:00] <Cork> as again that is exactly what users want
[05:37:13] <joaocastanho> No problem.
[05:37:25] <joaocastanho> so I should do the check in the other browser?
[05:37:30] <joaocastanho> and how would I close it?
[05:37:30] <joaocastanho> or not even open it?
[05:37:53] <Cork> you can't really
[05:38:28] <Cork> you can close it after a while from the opening page, but as you don't know the state you don't know when
[05:39:27] <joaocastanho> okay, cool.
[05:39:33] <Cork> O_o
[05:40:10] <joaocastanho> Sorry Cork :P
[05:40:38] <Cork> to be clear, i'm trying to make it obvious that this is a bad idea and you should avoid it...
[05:40:58] <joaocastanho> I know ... :/
[05:41:15] <Cork> and the most likely event is that you will make ppl avoid your page
[05:41:23] <joaocastanho> This wont be use forever I think
[05:41:24] <Cork> cause of the horrible experience
[05:41:43] <joaocastanho> well, they can close the popup
[05:41:44] <Dorian-Grim> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/t244o0h2/1/ this is the exact replica of the DOM
[05:41:53] <Dorian-Grim> but still, it works in jsfiddle, but not in my env
[05:41:55] <Dorian-Grim> wtf...
[05:42:00] <Cork> you're basically trying to reproduce the horrible state of the late 90's
[05:42:11] <Cork> even though browsers now days block that hard
[05:42:23] <Dorian-Grim> https://jsfiddle.net/t244o0h2/2/
[05:42:26] <Dorian-Grim> This Cork
[05:42:29] <joaocastanho> Is that for me Cork?
[05:42:51] <Cork> joaocastanho: the links are another question
[05:42:57] <Cork> the comments are for you
[05:43:19] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: are you running $() directly in a script tag on your page or how are you calling it?
[05:43:24] <joaocastanho> this was done in the 90's?
[05:43:29] <joaocastanho> xD
[05:43:32] <Cork> joaocastanho: yes it was
[05:43:39] <Cork> and then there wasn't popup blockers and xss blocks
[05:43:43] <Cork> it was horrible
[05:43:50] <joaocastanho> right
[05:43:51] <Cork> and that is why this is making me slightly upset...
[05:43:56] <Dorian-Grim> exactly like in the javascript section of the jsfiddle Cork
[05:44:00] <Cork> ok
[05:44:08] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: you need to wrap it in $(function() {});
[05:44:13] <joaocastanho> Yeah, I know this is not very good for user experience
[05:44:22] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: else it runs before the body is parsed so the element won't exist
[05:44:30] <Dorian-Grim> it's wrapped in a $(document).ready(function()
[05:44:39] <Cork> joaocastanho: not just not very good it is about the worst
[05:44:44] <joaocastanho> Well, let's see how it goes, if it goes too bad, I won't use it
[05:44:49] <joaocastanho> just an experience
[05:44:55] <Cork> joaocastanho: the only part missing is a trap so the user can't leave before they "like" you...
[05:45:14] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: is the elements added dynamically?
[05:45:19] <joaocastanho> they can leave xD
[05:45:24] <joaocastanho> there will be a button :)
[05:45:29] <Cork> ...
[05:45:34] <joaocastanho> they just do it if they want
[05:45:54] <Cork> except you will nag them and throw junk in there face...
[05:45:55] <Dorian-Grim> Cork: Yes, they are
[05:46:02] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: that's the problem then
[05:46:11] <Dorian-Grim> Am I maybe calling the selector before element created?
[05:46:19] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: $() searches the dom for the elements matching the selector
[05:46:27] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: then it adds event handler to each of them
[05:46:47] <Cork> if elements isn't in the page when the selector runs, they aren't targeted
[05:46:59] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: the solution for this is to use delegate
[05:47:00] <Dorian-Grim> I am using a polyfiller for the date
[05:47:12] <joaocastanho> Cork: Well, I know. I'm sorry...
[05:47:27] <Dorian-Grim> can you give me an example Cork?
[05:47:39] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: btw another question
[05:47:52] <Cork> does the id="date" exist more then once in the page?
[05:47:56] <Dorian-Grim> no
[05:48:09] <Dorian-Grim> only one input with that id
[05:48:26] <Cork> btw why don't you just use .ws-date instead of #data+input?
[05:48:58] <Dorian-Grim> Well, the same problem. Element doesn't exist right after document is ready since it's created with the polyfiller lib
[05:49:07] <Dorian-Grim> That's my guess
[05:49:56] <Dorian-Grim> The .ws-date is dynamic
[05:50:03] <Dorian-Grim> I don't have it in my code
[05:50:08] <Dorian-Grim> it's created with the polyfill
[05:50:27] <Dorian-Grim> I only have the input on line 2
[05:53:06] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: this is what i would recommend doing https://jsfiddle.net/t244o0h2/3/
[05:53:29] <Cork> try to avoid adding css in you're js
[05:53:36] <Cork> it makes maintaining the page MUCH simpler
[05:54:02] <Cork> you prob want a better name then state-2 though
[05:57:53] <Dorian-Grim> Cork: No matter what I try, that element doesn't do anything
[05:58:09] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: the last fiddle should work
[05:58:14] <Dorian-Grim> I changed to the $('table').on('focus', '.ws-date', function()
[05:58:16] <Cork> unless you don't have jquery loaded
[05:58:21] <Dorian-Grim> still doesn't trigger the function
[05:58:35] <Cork> do you have any errors in the browser console?
[05:58:39] <Dorian-Grim> nope...
[05:58:53] <Dorian-Grim> It's because of the darn polyfill
[05:58:55] <Dorian-Grim> But it's confusing
[05:59:02] <Cork> ah
[05:59:03] <Dorian-Grim> why wouldn't it work
[05:59:12] <Cork> ya, the pollyfill migth do return false
[05:59:23] <Cork> then you can't catch the events cause it kills it
[05:59:23] <Dorian-Grim> I am calling webshim.polyfill('forms forms-ext');
[05:59:30] <Dorian-Grim> Then after the focus
[05:59:48] <Dorian-Grim> then after, the focus*
[06:00:24] <Dorian-Grim> But I am targeting the element with css, why wouldn't jquery target it?
[06:00:45] <Cork> it is targeting it
[06:01:06] <Cork> firstly try console.log($('table .ws-date').length
[06:01:25] <Cork> if that > 0 the selector isn't the problem (this needs to run when the element exists)
[06:02:52] <Dorian-Grim> it's 1, then undefined
[06:05:32] <Cork> undefined??
[06:05:44] <Dorian-Grim> Yes, I get two rows in console
[06:05:51] <Cork> ah
[06:05:53] <Dorian-Grim> a 1 value, and the 2nd is undefined
[06:05:56] <Cork> ok
[06:06:03] <Cork> so there is one element matching
[06:06:15] <Dorian-Grim> How do I run when it exists?
[06:06:18] <Cork> so the event hander is added and the target is there
[06:06:36] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: the problem is most like i said before
[06:06:47] <Cork> the pollyfill kills the events so you can't get to them
[06:07:15] <Cork> from what you've explained, that is the only answer i can think of
[06:07:21] * Cork afk
[06:07:26] <Dorian-Grim> How do I fix?
[06:09:00] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: try to get it to work without the pollyfill
[06:09:07] <Cork> if it works, don't use the pollyfill
[06:09:21] <Cork> else... wait,...
[06:09:29] <Cork> Dorian-Grim: is the table added dynamically too?
[06:09:39] <Dorian-Grim> but stupid IE doesn't know how to create date inputs
[06:09:40] <Dorian-Grim> I need poly
[06:09:41] <Dorian-Grim> -.-
[06:10:10] <Dorian-Grim> Table is not dynamical. Only that darn date input poly
[06:10:26] <Cork> ok, then ya look for another replacement i guess
[06:10:30] <Cork> IF it works without it
[06:11:01] <Cork> html form date pickers suck quite badly so might want to have a look at jquery ui datepicker anyway
[06:12:24] <Dorian-Grim> html form date pickers indeed suck
[06:12:50] <Cork> i just disable the built in datepicker for none mobile devices
[06:13:04] <Cork> and use jquery ui datepicker for all of them
[06:13:20] <Cork> the mobile date pickers are quite good so i use them
[06:13:51] <Cork> (the fact that you can't control the format AT ALL in chrome is the worst part)
[06:14:17] <Dorian-Grim> $(window).load(function() works
[06:14:25] <Cork> O_o
[06:14:26] <Dorian-Grim> but I get a bunch of errors in the console
[06:14:34] <Cork> that shouldn't make a difference...
[06:14:48] <Cork> anyway gtg for a longer bit this time
[06:16:05] <Dorian-Grim> in chrome errors in console. In IE not
[06:16:06] <Dorian-Grim> wtf...
[06:18:00] <user1337> Hi everybody :) I'd like to ask if there is a way to use QUnit to run a few tests that determine capabilities of a device and based on the results run additional tests? In general I'd like to skip some tests at 'run time' (after QUnit.start()). Is there a way to remove tests from QUnit's queue?
[06:25:04] <mocas> hi, exist some live selector? I have a selector like $( "#sortable" ).sortable(...); I would like that when I create a new object it would be sortable too...
[06:37:23] <Dorian-Grim> mocas: Add id attribute after creation
[06:38:26] <dni> dont use ids multiple times
[06:38:36] <dni> use ".sortable" instead
[06:47:13] <mocas> Dorian-Grim: didin't work.... :'(
[06:49:09] <Dorian-Grim> Show code
[06:49:20] <Dorian-Grim> and yes, use class instead of id
[07:07:00] <w3gi> Hi i have troubles with a 3d spin... after one image it stop working... http://jsfiddle.net/rd3oxpq3/
[07:07:44] <w3gi> i want to turn the spin just when clicking and pulling the mouse
[07:08:14] <Cork> w3gi: you need to bind the events on the wraping element not the images
[07:08:42] <w3gi> it's bind on the ul
[07:08:44] <Cork> as you show/hide the images the target for the event changes and things break
[07:09:37] <vedu> Hello. I need a plugin with which I can zoom in images on click. On googling I just get results for zoom on hover.
[07:09:46] <Dorian-Grim> w3gi: what is cool
[07:09:48] <Dorian-Grim> that*
[07:10:33] <w3gi> Cork, i dont get it...
[07:11:29] <Cork> w3gi: also you want mouseleave not mouseout
[07:12:13] <w3gi> Cork, i dont see there a mouseout or mouseleave...
[07:12:20] <w3gi> did you look at the code?
[07:12:26] <Cork> w3gi: also i would prob recommend checking the "state" on the treeDspin instead of adding/removing the listener all the time
[07:12:43] <Cork> w3gi: https://jsfiddle.net/rd3oxpq3/3/
[07:13:33] <Cork> and finnally, i would prob bind the mousemove on the document
[07:13:45] <Cork> so the spinning doesn't stop when you go outside the ul
[07:16:50] <w3gi> Cork, i am going to use more then one spin on the page...
[07:17:00] <Cork> w3gi: doesn't matter
[07:17:13] <Cork> you set the target based on what element you did mousedown on
[07:17:22] <Cork> and on page mouseup you reset it
[07:17:31] <w3gi> could you show me please how you mean that with the state? i am not really a js coder
[07:18:23] <w3gi> where is the problem with setting and unsetting listeners?
[07:19:13] <Cork> $(document').on('mousedown', '.treeDspin', function() { sharedVariable = $(this); }).on('mouseup', function() { sharedVariable = null; });
[07:19:54] <Cork> $(document).on('mousemove', function() { if(sharedVariable != null) { /* rotate sharedVariable */ }); })
[07:20:04] <Cork> * $(document).on('mousemove', function() { if(sharedVariable != null) { /* rotate sharedVariable */ } });
[07:20:10] <Cork> that is what i mean
[07:41:53] <w3gi> Cork, i have it done as you told... but now i am not sure how to address the moveImg...
[07:42:39] <w3gi> $('.treeDspin li')... i need to replace .treeDspin with the variable selectedSpin
[07:45:15] <Audlex-> i want to add a google analytics click event to a form submit button but the CMS generates the form
[07:45:27] <Audlex-> can i inject an onclick to the button with jquery?
[07:48:26] <yellowgum> hey there again
[07:49:59] <Cork> w3gi: selectedSpin.find('li')
[07:50:08] <Cork> or selectedSpin.children('li')
[07:50:33] <Cork> Andr3as_: just add an event listner, don't inject an attribute
[08:06:04] <w3gi> Cork and how would you add a simple zoom for the images?
[08:07:49] <Cork> define simple
[08:08:51] <w3gi> box next to it which show a part of the bigger img
[08:09:14] <Cork> those aren't that simple
[08:09:33] <Cork> you have to track the mouse cursor and then calculate what area of the smaller image that mapps to
[08:09:44] <w3gi> other idea?
[08:09:48] <Cork> then upscale those coordinats and show that from a bigger image
[08:09:59] <Cork> that is basically the only way
[08:10:04] <techouse> using $(window) with jQuery 3.0.0 and jQuery Migrate 3.0.0 throws an error at me saying DOMException: Blocked a frame with origin "http://www.fooo.bar" from accessing a cross-origin frame
[08:10:11] <techouse> umm, any workaround for that?
[08:11:13] <Cork> techouse: works fine here https://jsfiddle.net/czjqmohh/
[08:13:54] <w3gi> Cork, but i dont find any code example which is quite basic suff
[08:14:16] <w3gi> all of them has 200 functions more like mousewheel involved, etc...
[08:14:48] <Cork> w3gi: http://www.elevateweb.co.uk/image-zoom/examples
[08:14:55] <Cork> ^3 sec of searching
[08:15:43] <Cork> if you want more just check https://startpage.com/do/search?q=jquery image zoom
[08:15:47] <w3gi> yes i had them 20 min ago
[08:16:01] <w3gi> i search a tutorial or something
[08:16:16] <Cork> you won't find tutorials for everything you want to do
[08:16:25] <Cork> most of the time you will only find code examples
[08:16:26] <w3gi> not a finnish plugin with obfuscate code and 600 additional functions i dont need
[08:17:40] <w3gi> i see for that i ask here... maybe someone know at least a simple script which is easier to understand
[08:17:52] <Cork> w3gi: it isn't obfuscated https://github.com/elevateweb/elevatezoom
[08:17:56] <Cork> its mit code...
[08:17:59] <Cork> just read
[08:18:16] <techouse> Cork, investigating :/
[08:18:19] <Cork> the download link of the page points to a minified file
[08:18:26] <Cork> but most releases are like that
[08:18:51] <Cork> but again, creating image zoom isn't basic
[08:18:55] <Cork> it is quite complicated
[08:20:05] <yellowgum> so, again, how do i make a streaming video player in jquery and html5?
[08:20:35] <yellowgum> i.e. withrtmp/hls/dash support
[08:20:47] <w3gi> damn... that 1790 lines of code is to much for me... half i dont get and dont understand... i cant belive you can create a 3d spin with 40-50 lines of code but for creating a div, postioning it and show an image in it take that much of code
[08:31:48] <techouse> smm, seems i have a different issue
[08:31:57] <techouse> it's connected with .offset
[08:32:00] <techouse> :P
[08:32:03] <Cork> w3gi: you don't need that much, but you will need something like 300-400 lines
[08:37:17] <w3gi> how i can find out what is the actual image under the mouse?
[08:37:53] <w3gi> or what is the mouse staying on
[08:39:21] <jose3_> how can i make an if condition to check 3 form values at once? is there a more effient way to write this: (($('#prompt_first_name').val() !== '') && ($('#prompt_last_name').val() !== '')) &&  ($('#prompt_phone').val() !== '')  ?
[08:39:57] <jose3_> I had this before:   if ( $('#prompt_first_name, #prompt_last_name, #prompt_phone').val() !== '' )  However, this is saying true if only the 1st  input is filled
[08:45:12] <yellowgum> so...anyone?
[09:00:58] <KnightsOfNi> Hi, how would you replace this .find('.sub-menu *') if you already have a variable $subMenu ?
[09:01:18] <KnightsOfNi> $subMenu * something
[09:09:32] <shoky> yellowgum: making a streaming video player is a very advanced and complicated subject with many parts.. it has nothing to do with jquery (you could use jquery for the UI controls maybe but not much more) and is not something many people have any experience with, especially not in a jquery channel
[09:09:40] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: give it a guess
[09:09:47] <Cork> you have basically answered it you're self
[09:09:58] <shoky> yellowgum: people see your question, they don't respond because nobody has a clue about building a video player
[09:10:02] <KnightsOfNi> $subMenu.find('*') ?
[09:10:05] <Cork> yup!
[09:10:08] <shoky> (replying to stuff you said yesterday too)
[09:10:19] <KnightsOfNi> isn't that overkill, to do a find like that?
[09:10:36] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: no, that is about the most efficient way to do it
[09:10:56] <Cork> $subMenu.find('*') is basically mapping to $subMenu[0].querySelectorAll('*')
[09:11:22] <KnightsOfNi> ok ty
[09:11:25] <Cork> np
[09:13:10] <yellowgum> well, shoky, i know that it's possible to make a player w/ js (video.js) and jquery in this case will act as a sugar
[09:13:29] <shoky> yellowgum: that is not building your own video player , that's using a library
[09:13:39] <shoky> if you have questions about using some library, feel free to ask
[09:13:54] <yellowgum> aaaand you've got it wrong
[09:14:13] <KnightsOfNi> is that cached? Suppose I do find('*') inside an event handler, does it perform the find each time?
[09:14:17] <yellowgum> thing is - not _using_ the library, but making it from scratch
[09:14:35] <Cork> KnownSyntax_: it isn't cached
[09:14:45] <Cork> KnownSyntax_: if you want cached you need to do that you're self
[09:14:56] <yellowgum> and i meant an example of video.js as a "library" here
[09:19:32] <shoky> yellowgum: hm? i didn't say it's not possible
[09:20:08] <yellowgum> so if it's not impossible it should be doable
[09:23:17] <shoky> so? still has nothing to do with jquery and not something people here would generally know about. also i doubt they did it "from scratch"... it's just using the built in video player, maybe with fallbacks to some flash player
[09:24:22] <shoky> anyway people see your question, you can stop with the annoying "so.. anyone?"  spam
[09:58:27] <coderfromcincy> is anyone here big on wireframing?
[10:05:05] <jamiejackson> hi folks. how do i select the the next (must be *after* the current element) sibling of a given class?
[10:06:31] <jamiejackson> that was ambiguous. i'll reword
[10:07:09] <jamiejackson> how do i select an element's next sibling, where the sibling has a certain class?
[10:07:46] <taplar> nextAll(selector).first()
[10:08:39] <Cork> wow.. seriously...
[10:08:50] <Cork> chrome is nuts when it comes to input fields...
[10:09:15] <taplar> hmm?
[10:09:16] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/5bvm6kso/ <-- it cuts the text height even though there is plenty of space
[10:09:25] <Cork> (check the g)
[10:09:43] <jamiejackson> works, taplar, thanks.
[10:10:11] <taplar> Cork, looks fine for me, though i am in chromium
[10:10:24] <Cork> taplar: same here...
[10:10:30] <shoky> looks fine for me but getting Refused to execute script from 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Sans' because its MIME type ('text/css') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[10:10:32] <Cork> you load the webfont?
[10:10:43] <Cork> ahh...
[10:10:56] <Cork> damn didn't think of that (i have droid sans locally)
[10:11:05] <taplar> yeah, refused font
[10:14:10] <Cork> hmm
[10:14:27] <Cork> its jsfiddle going bonkers and trying to load it as a script...
[10:15:52] <Cork> there http://jsfiddle.net/5bvm6kso/1/
[10:17:01] <taplar> chrome, chromium, firefox, g looks fine
[10:17:08] <Cork> weird
[10:18:34] <taplar> i'm on v51 though, lets see if the update changes anything
[10:19:30] <taplar> yeah, still looks fine
[10:20:10] <Cork> taplar: https://i.imgur.com/xQuitxb.png
[10:20:32] <taplar> huh
[10:20:55] <Cork> the bottom of the g is cut off here as you see in that image
[10:21:01] <shoky> looks fine here too
[10:22:15] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/5bvm6kso/2/
[10:22:28] <Cork> those two should look close to the same
[10:22:45] <Cork> the first one is cut of for me
[10:23:08] <Cork> (and several others around here too so...)
[10:23:50] <Cork> https://i.imgur.com/vtN8MGT.png
[10:24:50] <taplar> what os, res you running?
[10:25:09] <taplar> wouldn't think it would matter with a webfont but...
[10:26:57] <Cork> different distros of linux
[10:27:20] <taplar> you on windows shoky?
[10:27:34] <shoky> yea
[10:27:43] <taplar> same
[10:29:39] <Cork> it seams like chrome fails at calculating the font metrics
[10:29:45] <Cork> and there is no way to control it at all
[10:29:48] <gnu_d> Hi, when having two input boxes with jQuery UI autocompletion, how do I set additional GET params on the second input when the first input a country for instanced is being selected ?
[10:30:13] <Cork> gnu_d: you have to use source as a function
[10:30:18] <Cork> and make the ajax call you're self
[10:30:32] <gnu_d> Cork: so, there isn't more automated way :) ?
[10:30:42] <Cork> it is quite automated
[10:30:57] <gnu_d> Cork: ah, thanks anyways :).
[10:31:04] <Cork> source: function(request, response) { $.ajax(url).done(response); }
[10:31:16] <Cork> i don't see how it can be much more automated then that :)
[10:31:47] <Cork> (that code is written from memory so i might have flipped argument orders or something like that)
[10:31:49] <gnu_d> Cork: :) when 10 additional lines of code :D, just kidding
[10:32:09] <gnu_d> Cork: I got that code already, but I thought I'm doing something wrong
[10:32:54] <Cork> gnu_d: the ui design is make the simple things built in
[10:32:58] <Cork> and make it easy to extend
[10:33:07] <Cork> this follows that exactly
[10:33:07] <gnu_d> :)
[10:33:31] <gnu_d> I see
[10:40:28] <skinux> How can we get a Modal like what Facebook uses to say something has been shared?
[10:41:07] <skinux> I'd like something like that, but longer as there will be several form fields in it.
[10:41:20] <skinux> Or taller I should say
[10:48:54] <Cork> wow even funnier
[10:49:15] <Cork> taplar: its a rounding bug, changing the font size to 13px or 15px fixes the bug...
[10:49:33] <taplar> lol, nice
[10:50:11] <taplar> not like 12px is standard for the majority of stuff, :)
[10:51:00] <Cork> ya..
[10:51:04] <Cork> but 12px works too
[10:51:18] <Cork> its just 14,16,18 that breaks...
[10:51:21] <taplar> hmm
[10:51:23] <Cork> *sick*
[10:51:28] <Cork> *sigh
[10:52:29] <Cork> also it doesn't happen with input fields standard fonts
[10:52:40] <taplar> and you said it was doing it on all your distros?  so does that lean towards a kernal issue?
[10:57:21] <SpecialTech> @cork Chrome sucks for fonts in general imo lol I'm currently having issues with font sizing on Google Nexus 6p... like really? lol
[11:01:13] <hlve> what exactly would the code "; !function ($) {" do at the beginning of a script?
[11:01:23] <hlve> Not entirely sure why it was coded like this.
[11:01:26] <hlve> ; = strict?
[11:01:56] <taplar> ; would be protection against a preincluded script that didn't terminate correctly i believe
[11:02:10] <taplar> not sure what the '!' is for though
[11:02:29] <hlve> !function is throwing me off.
[11:03:03] <thebope> Is there any reason $(document).ready(function() {... }); would be firing twice?
[11:03:32] <taplar> possibly script included twice
[11:04:11] <hlve> thebope, do you have $(function() { declared elsewhere?
[11:04:22] <SpecialTech> ! is to to run the function immediately
[11:04:25] <shoky> the !  is another way to turn it into IIFE
[11:04:33] <SpecialTech> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7145514/whats-the-purpose-of-starting-semi-colon-at-beginning-of-javascript
[11:04:37] <taplar> didn't know that
[11:04:38] <shoky> instead of wrapping with ()
[11:05:11] <thebope> I actually declare the script right in the <head> element taplar in script tags. hlve I don't believe so...
[11:05:12] <hlve> oh interesting
[11:05:23] <hlve> shoky, what about the !function?
[11:05:24] <taplar> may have to start using that, :D
[11:05:25] <thebope> I'm going to double check
[11:05:30] <thebope> Yea that is interesting
[11:05:48] <taplar> i do the ; thing but never the !fun...
[11:05:56] <SpecialTech> Putting the !  in front of the anonymous closure is a more succinct way of executing the function immediately, while providing defense against file concatenation errors.
[11:05:59] <shoky> hlve: the ! is to turn the function into a function expression (instead of a statement)
[11:06:15] <shoky> then the () at the end calls this function expression
[11:06:40] <hlve> ah. interesting.
[11:06:41] <hlve> thank you.
[11:06:41] <shoky> cause you can't just do:    function() { ... } ()
[11:06:52] <shoky> you have to do either:   (function() { ... })()
[11:06:56] <shoky> or:  !function() { ... }()
[11:07:15] <SpecialTech> hlve: if you want to read more as well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3755606/what-does-the-exclamation-mark-do-before-the-function
[11:07:17] <taplar> wait, so you still need the () at the end?
[11:07:39] <shoky> the () at the end is to call the function
[11:07:49] <shoky> the ! or the wrapping ( ... )  is to turn the function into an expression
[11:07:54] <taplar> right. ah
[11:07:56] <shoky> you can't () call a statement
[11:08:36] <skinux> How do I do a FB- "share completed" type of Modal where the contents of the Modal would be loading of another page?
[11:09:26] <SpecialTech> skinux - iframe or trying to load()?
[11:09:38] <skinux> Umm..I don't know...
[11:09:46] <skinux> I don't know how to do a Modal in jQuery at all
[11:10:19] <skinux> I want to have an "Add" button or link on my app page which onclick will bring up the Modal for adding a new item.
[11:10:28] <SpecialTech> why not use a framework, and when the fb share complete is done, use load()
[11:10:39] <taplar> jquery ui has dialogs.  or you can roll your own
[11:10:52] <taplar> not hard to position fixed a div
[11:11:07] <skinux> Nah, nah..not looking to do an FB share, I just want a Modal like what FB uses to say something has been shared.
[11:11:20] <thebope> Ahhh found my issue, thanks guys
[11:12:21] <skinux> Is a dialog what I want? The Modal will contain a form with up to 10 fields.
[11:14:21] <coderfromcincy> jquery ui or bootstrap have easy to configure modals
[11:20:49] <SpecialTech> i prefer foundation lol
[11:39:43] <VectorX> in this line, $(".vertical-filter, .type-filter, .news-month-filter ").on( 'change click',   / the first two classes are <select> and last is a <ul><li> how can i only do the click for the list ? without making another listener just for that ?
[11:41:14] <robertmaxrees> are you going to do something different for that particular case?
[11:42:02] <VectorX> no
[11:42:19] <taplar> another event handler isn't bad, provided you extract the handler to a named function
[11:42:24] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:42:32] <VectorX> ok
[11:42:56] <taplar> instead of putting filter logic in your handler
[11:43:02] <robertmaxrees> ^ exactly.
[11:43:05] <VectorX> ok
[11:43:11] <robertmaxrees> named functions are pretty neat anyway.
[11:43:46] <arc_> what does extract mean in this context
[11:44:03] <robertmaxrees> instead of using an inline anonymous function you give it a name.
[11:44:06] <robertmaxrees> and use that instead.
[11:44:10] <taplar> remove from the inline structure it currently is in and place else where
[11:44:30] <taplar> i could have said refactor, *shrug*  same thing in this case
[11:44:34] <arc_> heh ok
[11:44:44] <robertmaxrees> "Make not an inline anonymous function".
[11:44:47] <arc_> just making sure i'm not missing something
[11:44:50] <robertmaxrees> plenty of ways to phrase that.
[11:44:53] <VectorX> is that like var x = function
[11:45:03] <robertmaxrees> yes.  you would write a function.
[11:45:07] <taplar> or function x ()
[11:45:22] <robertmaxrees> either/or.  subtle differences, but neither are particularly important in this case.
[11:59:47] <VectorX> is there a quick way beside using something like tampermonkey to write JS to affect page content ?
[12:01:42] <taplar> you could just stick it in your console
[12:01:55] <taplar> otherwise tampermonkey or greasemonkey
[12:02:06] <sillyslux> and bookmarklets
[12:02:50] <VectorX> looking for something more permanent, used mainly to hihglight various text on pages i visit
[12:03:00] <sillyslux> and chrome devtools snippets
[12:03:19] <VectorX> sillyslux that seems like an option
[12:03:24] <sillyslux> if you want permanent then tamper-/greasemonkey
[12:03:41] <VectorX> yeah, when i use that, i keep getting various popups
[12:04:13] <VectorX> i dont get the popups when i disable tampermonkey
[12:04:44] <taplar> give greasemonkey a shot then.  never got a popup from it
[12:05:50] <VectorX> thats in FF if im not mistaken, i use chrome though
[12:06:00] <VectorX> ill try the snippets
[12:07:41] <taplar> apparently greasemonkey was being ported to chrome as greasemetal, but development stopped with chrome introducing user scripts
[12:08:13] <arc_> tampermonkey is basically the same thing
[12:08:29] <VectorX> yeah
[12:08:31] <arc_> i use it all the time and the only popup i get is when it updates, it shows the changelog
[12:08:41] <arc_> which doesn't happen very often
[12:11:12] <sillyslux> i just tried tampermonkey and got a new tab with "A userscript wants to access a cross-origin resource."
[12:11:38] <sillyslux> after "allowing  permanently" there are no more popups
[12:17:06] <VectorX> i get spam popups, like the computer has got a virus etc, when i disable it no more popups
[12:17:14] <VectorX> malware stuff
[12:17:40] <VectorX> sillyslux do you know how to get the snippet to auto execute on ever page load ?
[12:17:43] <VectorX> for any site
[12:20:03] <duch_kazatel> VectorX when using greasemonkey?
[12:20:12] <VectorX> tampermonkey
[12:20:33] <VectorX> duch_kazatel question for sillyslux was when using the devtools snippet of chrome
[12:21:04] <sillyslux> snippets can only be executed manually
[12:21:14] <VectorX> ok
[12:21:36] <sillyslux> if you want permanent then tamper-/greasemonkey
[12:22:00] <sillyslux> i haven't tried chrome user scripts though
[12:22:12] <sillyslux> *.user.js
[12:22:16] <arc_> if you get popups like that then it sounds like you have some userscript installed that is causing it
[12:22:50] <sillyslux> there are bad scripts out there
[12:23:16] <VectorX> arc_ i dont see anything in the list, but ill go thru them and see if something is hidden, all i did was install TM and create my own scripts
[12:23:44] <taplar> sillyslux: blasphemy!
[12:24:08] <sillyslux> http://tampermonkey.net/scripts.php quote: "A lot of SPAM and SCAM scripts that for example try to hijack your Facebook account -> be careful!"
[12:24:09] <arc_> don't rule out your own scripts being modified
[12:25:02] <arc_> it's also possible that one of your userscripts is interfering with your adblock extension
[12:25:28] <VectorX> ill check them out
[12:25:41] <arc_> easiest thing to do is to disable all userscripts and see if it still does that, then enable them one at a time until it starts happening again
[12:26:16] <arc_> if it happens while you have no userscripts enabled then you probably got tampermonkey from some unofficial source
[12:27:26] <VectorX> got it from the google extensions, but ill try your suggestion
[13:09:15] <bberry> so im trying to create a way to allow users to select multiple rows in a table.  Using the something like $("tr:gt(x):lt(y)).addClass('selected');  However, this is turning out to be pretty messy. https://jsfiddle.net/n5rf3nr8/1/
[13:10:10] <bberry> i understand that i have to convert from a 1 based indexing to 0 based indexing
[13:10:12] <robertmaxrees> so like, highlight every row they click?
[13:10:31] <taplar> nifty
[13:10:34] <robertmaxrees> or you want a click+drag thing?
[13:10:49] <bberry> no, each individual click will select a new row.  when holding shift click, it'll select multiple.  when ctrl+click, itll add on to whatever has already been clicked
[13:10:59] <bberry> nah, not trying to implement click+drag
[13:11:10] <bberry> mostly the shift click is giving me trouble
[13:11:20] <bberry> and its inconsistent
[13:11:32] <bberry> click "bar", hold shift, then click "baz"
[13:11:54] <bberry> itll select bar, baz, and qux
[13:12:08] <bberry> then click bar, hold shift, and click qux
[13:12:27] <bberry> itll do all those + fep so thats consistent
[13:12:40] <bberry> but then left click baz, shift, then click huk
[13:12:43] <bberry> it adds 2!
[13:14:38] <robertmaxrees> i wish i had time to poke at it right now because the basic idea is actually pretty simple :(
[13:14:45] <bberry> haha yeah
[13:14:55] <bberry> so, im beginning to think that using the gt and lt operators arent meant to be used for this purpose
[13:15:02] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use them anyway.
[13:15:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd .filter() out all TRs whose .index() isn't within your range.
[13:15:52] <bberry> yeah, ill try that instead haha thanks
[13:16:20] <robertmaxrees> and have click always add the border.  something along those lines.
[13:16:39] <bberry> yeah
[13:19:40] <bberry> ype, that worked perfectly, thanks m8 :D
[13:19:58] <robertmaxrees> all about simplifying the problem.
[13:20:41] <robertmaxrees> and also: filter() is like the ultimate swiss army knife for even remotely complex cases where you want to take a collection and reduce it down.
[13:21:15] <bberry> lol yeah, i was thinking itd be a good idea to use it, but i saw on SO someone recommending my method
[13:21:25] <bberry> thats what i get for not trusting my instincts >.<
[13:21:37] <bberry> by "my method" i meant the lt/gt idea
[13:21:59] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha.  your head was in the right place.  just one of those things.
[13:22:01] <taplar> was it mentioned that you could delegate on 'td' and not do that top if?
[13:23:09] <bberry> taplar: haha nope.  I was thinking about doing that but i wasnt sure if jquery behind the scenes was going to add an individual event listener for each row in the table
[13:23:14] <bberry> if not, ill definitely do that!
[13:23:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:23:26] <taplar> nope, just one
[13:23:31] <bberry> perfect
[13:23:44] <robertmaxrees> delegated listeners only bind to the elements you specifcy in the initial selector.
[13:23:51] <bberry> cool
[14:12:34] <Anfallem> Hello, I have a question concerning dynamic dom element generation.  "var dynamicDiv=$('<div></div>')" works, however "var dynamicObj=$('<object></object>')" returns an anonymous functions instead of a dom element
[14:13:28] <Anfallem> I suppose I could have a hidden <object> element that is do dynamicObj=$("object").clone() on or something to that effect
[14:13:32] <Anfallem> but that seems clunky
[14:23:27] <decx> i get an object just fine
[14:40:25] <yottabyte> if I want to call a function when a deferred is done, what's better? deferred.done(myFunction()); or deferred.done(function() { myFunction() });?
[14:43:51] <taplar> either work, but first you wouldn't do the inner ()
[14:44:22] <taplar> deferred.done(myFunction)
[14:44:28] <yottabyte> what?
[14:44:36] <yottabyte> ever? why?
[14:44:53] <taplar> functionName() <- that is an invocation right?
[14:45:15] <taplar> invocation = immediate execution
[14:45:26] <taplar> callbacks are function references
[14:45:46] <taplar> your giving method functions they they will later execute.  not you execute
[14:45:55] <joaocastanho> Hi. I have a jQuery UI dialog and I have an iframe within it. I want to close that dialog from the iframe.
[14:46:00] <yottabyte> hm, I see. So either deferred.done(myFunction) OR deferred.done(function() { myFunction(); });?
[14:46:02] <joaocastanho> So iframe will do the call
[14:46:14] <taplar> yottabyte: yup
[14:46:39] <yottabyte> thanks
[14:46:57] <taplar> joaocastanho: same domain?
[14:47:06] <joaocastanho> different
[14:47:46] <taplar> can't do that
[14:47:56] <joaocastanho> oh :(
[14:48:13] <taplar> cross domain scripts can't access each other
[14:48:33] <joaocastanho> and there's any solution?
[14:48:38] <joaocastanho> or it cant be really done?
[14:49:33] <taplar> three possible options.  1) if the iframe site has an api that you can use, you might can do something with that for your parent page to know when it needs to close the modal
[14:49:59] <taplar> 2) the other page could use postMessage to tell the parent information.  not great browser support here yet
[14:50:36] <taplar> 3) you could write a proxy page on your website that goes to the other domain that you actually use in your iframe, giving you same domain access
[14:50:41] <taplar> others may have other ideas
[14:51:26] <joaocastanho> okay
[14:51:52] <joaocastanho> thanks
[14:59:21] <snowmizer> anyone here that can answer a question about jquery and d3?
[15:29:35] <Solarlux> $('h1').animate({height: '250px'},1000); What is wrong with this line hwy animation doesn work?
[15:36:07] <shoky> Solarlux: works fine  https://jsfiddle.net/3cjs5hx7/1/
[15:36:42] <Solarlux> I ḿ idiot i forgot color
[15:36:43] <Solarlux> :D:D
[15:50:36] <tcjennings> hello, I have a question about widget coding
[15:51:56] <tcjennings> anyone?
[15:52:32] <tcjennings> I must be doing this wrong
[15:54:08] <shoky> yup, just ask your question (usually best accompanied by a jsfiddle/testcase if relevant) and be patient :)
[15:56:46] <tcjennings> ok…I’ve been hired to create a shopping cart widget like the one here: https://grademiners.com/order …. I traced some of the source code to jqueryUI but am unsure of how to build it and which codes I should use…any help would be greatly benficial as I am very inexperienced
[16:00:35] <shoky> uhm, that's not really a question :)  which part are you having trouble with?  do you know how to write html forms?   are you supposed to be writing just the client-side UI part or also the server processing..?
[16:02:31] <shoky> this channel is more for specific questions you might have about something not working,  or something specific you're having trouble understanding and need explanation..  if you don't know basics then you need to go learn, not ask for vague general help on irc
[16:03:04] <tcjennings> I know just a little about html forms, nothing as sophisticated as this shopping cart seems to be. I was hired to build a website, which I am using wordpress to do, the client then said he wanted that shopping cart on his page…I thought I would be able to download the widget code and paste it in easily, but have not been able to find it. I guess if this question is too broad, please direct me to where I need to go learn to figure out how to get the
[16:03:04] <tcjennings> shopping cart on the page
[16:03:45] <tcjennings> I am very newb, I know, I feel like I’m in the matrix just using IRC…
[16:07:25] <shoky> well i don't really know wordpress much but you probably want to find some good shopping cart plugin for it, and learn how to use it.  it has server-side components too, not something you can just copy from a site you're browsing, which is not something you should ever do anyway without understadning it
[16:07:55] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[16:07:59] <robertmaxrees> for a variety of reasons.
[16:08:00] <shoky> so maybe ask in wordpress channel or smth
[16:09:10] <tcjennings> ok thank you
[16:09:23] <decx> use woocommerce, it's mature has lots of support and a rich ecosystem of extensions and payment interfaces
[16:10:14] <tcjennings> ok I will do that…just couldnt find one that did all of the calculations that one did
[16:11:09] <robertmaxrees> For what it's worth, most of the stuff on that page would happen before the cart.
[16:11:52] <tcjennings> could you elaborate?
[16:12:51] <robertmaxrees> what exactly is your site going to be selling?
[16:13:40] <robertmaxrees> because that other one had a bunch of product configuration on it.
[16:13:57] <tcjennings> same sort of site, paper writing services
[16:14:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:14:23] <robertmaxrees> "paper writing services"
[16:14:38] <tcjennings> ghostwriting, paper mill, whatever you want to call it lol
[16:14:48] <robertmaxrees> "academically dishonest" ;)
[16:14:52] <tcjennings> that works too
[16:14:55] <robertmaxrees> my family worked in education for many years.
[16:15:16] <robertmaxrees> this sort of stuff always makes me pretty sad.
[16:15:50] <tcjennings> yes, its not my best project, but I have to pay rent and this guy wanted a wordpress site
[16:16:04] <robertmaxrees> that's too bad.
[16:16:07] <robertmaxrees> sorry to hear :(
[16:16:27] <tcjennings> well, education is most likely to be free in a couple of decades so all of it will go away
[16:16:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:16:45] <tcjennings> the only reason sites like this exist is because of student loans
[16:16:45] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't really make it OK.
[16:17:01] <robertmaxrees> that's... a really strange way to justify it, especially because it doesn't at all.
[16:17:30] <robertmaxrees> nor do student loans really have anything to really do with it.  either way, i'd follow shoky's advice and hit up a wordpress channel.  they should be able to help you.
[16:17:49] <robertmaxrees> just be aware that fome folks may not really want to.
[16:18:53] <tcjennings> sorry for the sad topic, I guess I have sold my educational soul…I didnt really think much about it till now tbh I just wanted to build a website and get paid to do it
[16:19:07] <tcjennings> Ill find a wordpress channel thanks for the directions
[16:19:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:38:12] <arc_> i don't get why people do stuff like that
[16:38:23] <robertmaxrees> what, sell papers for schools?
[16:38:26] <arc_> if you don't want to be in school, save somebody a lot of money and don't go
[16:38:34] <arc_> no, buy them actually
[16:38:54] <arc_> it's like, why are you even going
[16:38:55] <robertmaxrees> because they've been told for almost 15 years that they need a college degree.
[16:39:13] <arc_> i guess we didn't do a good enough job telling people that the learning part is the important part of the degree
[16:39:42] <robertmaxrees> sometimes people get pressured into fields they hate/aren't very good at.
[16:39:49] <robertmaxrees> all kinds of reasons.  none of them really valid :)
[17:17:03] <taplar> education free in a couple decades?
[17:17:09] <robertmaxrees> That's the goal in the US.
[17:17:18] <taplar> :s
[17:17:30] <taplar> i've heard we'd have flying cars too
[17:40:46] <saml> el.addEventListener('input', f);          $(el).trigger('input');     f() does not get called
[17:41:00] <robertmaxrees> nope.  jquery events and native dom events live in different worlds
[17:41:10] <robertmaxrees> jquery can trigger jquery handlers.
[17:41:32] <robertmaxrees> native dom events can trigger native handlers and jquery bindings
[17:41:43] <saml> oh i see
[17:42:22] <robertmaxrees> why not use a jquery binding in this case?
[17:59:37] <taplar> fun fun fun
[17:59:47] <robertmaxrees> a-hyup
[18:39:06] <vacho> I have a set of unchecked checkboxes, how can I with jQuery post empty variables..e.g. if checkbox name='XXX', I want my post to include the XXX variable but let it be empty
[18:42:16] <robertmaxrees> unless you do an ajax post, i'm not sure that you can.
[23:10:38] <Mapper99> $.ajax({ newbie here.... I have an ajax call which returns this json: http://pastebin.com/q34W9k48 What is the syntax to get to the data after I make the call - building = json.building; ?
[23:11:50] <Mapper99> Do I need to wrap my json with an object name or something first?
[23:14:53] <_August_> Mapper99, whats the problem?
[23:17:25] <Mapper99> I can't seem to access the json data in the callback.
[23:18:10] <_August_> got the code in pastebin?
[23:18:27] <Mapper99> Sure - http://pastebin.com/WsTg4FFt
[23:19:45] <_August_> is the url grabbing the full url of what you're trying to parse?
[23:20:16] <Mapper99> Yes, here is the JSOn that is returned: http://pastebin.com/q34W9k48
[23:20:58] <_August_> and you're trying to parse the data
[23:21:00] <_August_> try
[23:21:35] <Mapper99> yes - need to assign each attribute to a variable in a loop
[23:21:38] <_August_> wrapping it with var obj = $.parseJson(json);
[23:23:12] <Mapper99> is $.parseJson still in jQuery 3.0?
[23:24:11] <_August_> nope depreciated, use JSON.parse
[23:24:13] <_August_> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsejson/
[23:25:55] <Mapper99> thanks...I now get this error - Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1
[23:26:21] <Mapper99> Does that mean json is already an object?
[23:28:15] <_August_> you might have to stringify the object
[23:28:58] <_August_> take a look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14432165/uncaught-syntaxerror-unexpected-token-with-json-parse
[23:36:14] <Mapper99> OK, after stringify, this is what it looks like like:  http://pastebin.com/ZF80XnkD
[23:37:37] <Mapper99> How do go about assigning the data properties to a variable?
[23:44:19] <jak2000> hi all
[23:44:24] <jak2000> cork where are you from? .us?
[23:44:41] <_August_> Mapper99, you should be able to get the properties by parsing the obj
[23:44:56] <_August_> so something like obj.building should return the building name
[23:51:23] <Mapper99> >>August I think the problem is with my json data - it is not structured correctly?  http://pastebin.com/q34W9k48 - doesn't it need to be wrapped with something like this?  {"mainobject":[...rest of json
[23:56:12] <Mapper99> Every line section begins with a number - http://pastebin.com/raw/q34W9k48
