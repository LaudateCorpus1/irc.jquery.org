[00:00:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[00:01:05] <robertmaxrees> sorry - looks like you're already getting help in ##javascript :L) good luck :)
[01:10:57] <nanthencodeneeth> $(this:visible) is giving me error how to navigate through this
[02:21:27] <Cork> nanthencodeneeth: this is a variable and selectors are a string, so you have to use $(this).find() or $(this).filter/is depending on what your looking for
[05:29:51] <nanthencodeneeth> how to get text of visible child divs using jquery
[05:31:05] <robertmaxrees> use .find()
[05:32:26] <robertmaxrees> and .map()
[05:32:27] <robertmaxrees> nanthencodeneeth
[05:32:42] <nanthencodeneeth> I am new to jquery can you please add more comments to it
[05:32:50] <nanthencodeneeth> robertmaxrees
[05:32:59] <robertmaxrees> sure
[05:33:00] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/
[05:33:06] <robertmaxrees> great intro
[05:33:44] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle if you have more questions :)
[05:35:46] <nanthencodeneeth> here is a fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/05tes7z1/ .But it is a huge one.I cant create it to accurately.Any way if you can get it it will be a huge help for me how can i get amounts and quantity which are visible
[05:36:23] <nanthencodeneeth> how can i get rate and quantity which are visible andon live update
[05:36:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?  super confused.  where are you trying to get the visible divs there?
[05:36:44] <robertmaxrees> so first off - your code is invalid.
[05:36:47] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs.
[05:37:15] <nanthencodeneeth> ok i shall correct it and ask you
[05:37:15] <robertmaxrees> IDs must be unique per page.  every time you add another "div-table-row" you're causing more headaches.
[05:37:28] <nanthencodeneeth> thanks for the hep
[05:41:02] <nanthencodeneeth> robertmaxrees can you please tell me some method to avoid repetition of id
[05:41:14] <nanthencodeneeth> robertmaxrees how can i avoid that
[05:41:25] <robertmaxrees> use classes instead.
[05:41:29] <nanthencodeneeth> ok
[05:47:33] <robertmaxrees> nanthencodeneeth should be a simple change...
[05:50:10] <robertmaxrees> also: the markup in your js isn't valid.  <center>??  extra closing divs???
[05:50:38] <nanthencodeneeth> yes thank you robertmaxrees now i am doing it
[05:50:56] <robertmaxrees> should take 5 seconds.
[05:51:00] <robertmaxrees> i just did it for you...?
[05:52:09] <Robdgreat> sounds like someone's prematurely skipping ahead in the textbook
[05:52:16] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[05:52:56] <robertmaxrees> don't use <center> nanthencodeneeth
[05:53:11] <Robdgreat> oh, and using a 20  year old textbook
[05:53:16] <nanthencodeneeth> ok robertmaxrees
[05:53:39] <robertmaxrees> nanthencodeneeth i'm fading fast.  let's back WAY up - only "visible" divs??
[05:53:46] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you using inputs for this?
[05:54:23] <robertmaxrees> earlier you weren't using ajax - just normal form submits.  so like, what's with the extra rigamorole?
[05:55:43] <nanthencodeneeth> ok i shall use input
[05:56:30] <Robdgreat> it's frustrating when people only respond to every other line
[05:56:52] <Robdgreat> nanthencodeneeth: would you be so kind as to explain your reasoning for doing the extra stuff?
[05:57:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[06:00:35] <robertmaxrees> nanthencodeneeth not gonna help you any more.  the fractured responses and the lack of desire to learn... not encouraging.
[06:00:50] <nanthencodeneeth> ya definitely
[06:00:52] <nanthencodeneeth> sorry
[06:01:25] <nanthencodeneeth> robertmaxrees
[06:01:35] <robertmaxrees> ..
[06:01:51] <robertmaxrees> waiting
[06:01:54] <nanthencodeneeth> Can you please tell me how to loop through the divs
[06:01:58] <robertmaxrees> no.
[06:02:01] <nanthencodeneeth> robertmaxrees
[06:02:06] <robertmaxrees> go back and answer questions.
[06:02:36] <robertmaxrees> or use the site i gave you
[06:03:06] <nanthencodeneeth> thanks robertmaxrees
[06:03:20] <robertmaxrees> not going to cover basics.  there are plenty of self-serve places you can do that on your own
[06:03:26] <Robdgreat> nanthencodeneeth: normally if you want someone to write code for you, you pay them
[06:03:33] <robertmaxrees> ^
[06:04:22] <nanthencodeneeth> ok Robdgreat can you say some site where i can master jquery
[06:04:28] <nanthencodeneeth> i am ready to pay
[06:04:32] <Robdgreat> for the love of God.
[06:04:34] <nanthencodeneeth> how can i learn more
[06:04:45] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees already told you a site
[06:05:17] <nanthencodeneeth> but  i need questions to practise,Where can i come accross questions
[06:05:26] <Robdgreat> see, you can't go somewhere for help and then not even read what help you're given
[06:06:01] <nanthencodeneeth> I am really sorry i was correcting my code at that time
[06:06:15] <nanthencodeneeth> that is why there came a delay from my part
[06:06:15] <Robdgreat> well you're in luck. The text hasn't gone anywhere. Scroll up and read it
[06:07:44] <nanthencodeneeth> I read and that was definetly a mistake from my side for causing frustration by not replying
[06:07:50] <robertmaxrees> cool
[06:07:51] <nanthencodeneeth> i am really sorry
[06:07:54] <robertmaxrees> now go read.
[06:08:13] <nanthencodeneeth> thanks robertmaxrees
[06:09:01] <robertmaxrees> channels like this are best suited to pointed questions with specific examples: "here's an example: blah.com/kjhg.  i'm trying to do x.  i expect y, but z happens instead.  why?"
[06:09:27] <robertmaxrees> instead of "how do i get the text of all visible divs: {{link to big, massive, invalid code example}}"
[06:10:25] <nanthencodeneeth> robertmaxrees thanks for pointing my mistake i should have been more careful
[06:10:44] <robertmaxrees> k.  good luck, have fun!
[09:10:28] <robertparkerx> I have a site using a very old version of jquery and I get a error on the swedish version but not the english version. https://url.hashdev.org/50 Cannot read property 'replace' of null line 13 in the paste.
[09:10:43] <robertparkerx> I'm not sure why it error on swedish and not english
[09:12:22] <robertparkerx> nevermind
[09:12:26] <robertparkerx> I think I fixed it
[09:12:40] <robertparkerx> if(string != null) { replace }
[09:17:28] <robertparkerx> It seems to work now
[17:47:43] <sydbarret> I have this datatable where it appends blank spaces for the search box  https://bpa.st/GI7A
[17:48:01] <sydbarret> problem is that datatable has setting to save previous search
[17:48:09] <sydbarret> so when i refresh page
[17:48:28] <sydbarret> it appears  \bsearch_term\b
[18:08:56] <robertmaxrees> why do you have blank spaces getting appended?
[18:25:08] <sydbarret> robert so it can search the term whole word
[18:25:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:29:31] <sydbarret> yeah so it can match the whole word
[18:30:02] <robertmaxrees> saying the same thing isn't going to make that statement any less confusing.
[18:30:28] <sydbarret> haven you search something man? it has options if you wanna match whole word, case etc
[18:30:40] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[18:30:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah, actually.  i ran the entire integration of our search platform a few years ago.
[18:31:00] <robertmaxrees> so drop the attitude ;)
[18:31:07] <sydbarret> its plain english
[18:31:13] <sydbarret> so i dont know why you dont get it
[18:31:20] <robertmaxrees> all that code is doing is binding a keyup event listener.
[18:31:20] <sydbarret> im the one that speak spanish
[18:31:33] <robertmaxrees> why are you being so antagonistic to somebody that's trying to help you?
[18:31:49] <robertmaxrees> are you setting 'regex' somewhere else and then triggering 'keyup'?
[19:28:56] <robertparkerx> it seems like I'm using the wrong height https://url.hashdev.org/51
[19:29:11] <robertparkerx> on one page the height is a small number but the page length is also low
[19:29:32] <robertparkerx> on another where the page length is very long, the scroll past is so high it doesn't fire until very late
[19:31:11] <robertparkerx> just mDimensions.sidebarOffsetTop seem to work
[19:31:12] <robertmaxrees> firs q - any reason you're making those global vars?
[19:31:37] <robertparkerx> basically I'm reusing what was made but nopt working proper
[19:31:58] <robertparkerx> no reason
[19:33:05] <robertmaxrees> it's unrelated to this but i'd fix it.  secondly - are you trying to detect when something entered the viewport?
[19:36:04] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx
[19:41:04] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx also, declaring functions within functions, especially inside of a scroll handler, as well as re-running selectors is going to be a bad time for performance.
[19:41:29] <robertmaxrees> https://paste.hashdev.org/?fd1dbd4dab8e46f7#3GHksLW4e9GAb6pmqPP9VXfkXJqB11GaLXG1U5hwUtdK something like this (untested, still won't fix your bug) will be a little better.
[19:42:47] <robertparkerx> fixing that now
[19:45:00] <robertparkerx> $window.on('scroll', function() {
[19:45:01] <robertparkerx> :p
[19:45:06] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:45:21] <robertmaxrees> oh/
[19:45:22] <robertmaxrees> "Shrug"
[19:45:30] <robertmaxrees> like I said, untested ;)
[19:46:11] <robertparkerx> it works though
[19:46:12] <robertparkerx> :p
[19:46:17] <robertmaxrees> you're welcome
[19:46:24] <robertparkerx> ty
[19:46:33] <robertmaxrees> so like, without seeing the bug, it's hard to understand what the issue is.
[19:47:39] <robertmaxrees> like i asked earlier - are you trying to detect when something has entered the viewport?
[19:47:59] <robertparkerx> left
[19:48:03] <robertparkerx> leaves*
[19:52:06] <robertmaxrees> okay.  then you just need to check if the offset().top is greater than the window.scrollTop() + viewport height, of if the offset().top + the element height is less than the window.scrolTop()
[19:53:11] <robertmaxrees> if that's not working, then I'd have to see it.  i'd re-read the docs on .offset() to see the caveats it has.
[20:54:40] <robertparkerx> ty for always helping me
