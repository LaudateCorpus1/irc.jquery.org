[02:44:31] <mrniceguy> I got my result in my footer but seperated, how to sum it -- > https://jsfiddle.net/epu4tb5k/
[02:52:26] <Cork> mrniceguy: you mean sum all the columns or what?
[02:53:08] <mrniceguy> Yes, I now in footer I get 51 .. that should be 5+1 = 6
[02:53:55] <mrniceguy> Footer should say | 6 | 2 | 4 |
[02:55:19] <mrniceguy> Cork
[02:55:33] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/89vpnrjk/
[02:55:48] <Cork> you can sum text so you need to handle it as numbers
[02:56:05] <Cork> also you want to only fetch the tbody values
[02:56:18] <Cork> (else you will get NaN)
[02:57:38] <mrniceguy> Okey, so I could do simple as --> count++
[02:57:50] <mrniceguy> can't *
[02:58:05] <Cork> count++ will just increment by one, not sum
[02:58:37] <mrniceguy> I though about foreach the row from index and count them
[02:59:01] <Cork> ya, but then you would get the number of rows, not a sum of the values in them
[02:59:20] <Cork> so youi would get | 2 | 2 | 2 | instead
[03:52:13] <Zee-> When trying to pass ajax parameters like this: /GetCallBack?eventid=12540659&callbackPhone=%2B45xxxxxxxxxxx%2C - %2B = + and %2C = , - but it fails the method call to my server. If I remove the , / %2C it works like a charm. Why is it failing? :/
[03:53:49] <Cork> Zee-: when you make ajax calls it is normally simpler to do $.ajax(
[03:53:50] <Cork> opps
[03:54:32] <Cork> Zee-: when you make ajax calls it is normally simpler to do $.ajax('/GetCallback', { data: { eventid:12540659, callbackPhone: '', ... } })
[03:54:51] <Cork> makes it simpler to read and you don't have to care about escaping and concating correctly
[03:56:03] <Cork> (if you want to see the resulting ?<data> you can take the data object and give to $.param(object) and it will show you the result
[03:56:10] <Zee-> Cork it looks like this: https://pastebin.com/ty7rzVMt
[03:57:07] <Cork> hmm your saying your sending json though...
[03:57:29] <Cork> contactType isn't anything as it is a get call, might confuse the server
[03:57:51] <Zee-> contentType?
[03:58:00] <Cork> contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", <--
[03:58:10] <Zee-> You think I should remove that?
[03:58:11] <Cork> your making a get call you don't have json in the request
[03:58:42] <Cork> for get calls, it at least is unrelevant, at worst wrong
[03:58:58] <Zee-> Okay :)
[03:59:05] <Zee-> Taking a look at it. gimme 2 sec
[03:59:10] <Cork> also you really REALLY shouldn't use async: false,
[04:01:02] <Zee-> Doesn't change anything that i remove contentType. Still the same error.
[04:01:10] <Zee-> Why not?
[04:01:53] <Cork> cause 1. it is deprecated in jquery, 2. it is legacy in browser so it doesn't get new features if you do it syncronously, 3. cause it hangs the browser until the server responds to horrible experience for the user
[04:02:03] <Cork> 4. if the server doesn't respond the user get a hung browser
[04:02:20] <Cork> so, ya, through and through a bad idea
[04:02:22] <Zee-> Okay :/ Thank you :)
[04:04:21] <Zee-> Okay it did change something
[04:04:47] <Cork> it shouldn't fix the problem, it is something you need to take care of
[04:05:05] <Cork> you've been a bit vauge about what the server exactly is complaining about
[04:05:19] <Cork> what is an example url it exepects to get?
[04:05:52] <Zee-> The server is being called correctly not removing neither + or , but even though the server returns it fails and runs my error handling in ajax
[04:06:45] <Cork> might be your have code errors
[04:06:49] <Zee-> return new { success = true, phone = callbackPhone }
[04:06:51] <Cork> check the variables you get in the error callback
[04:06:55] <Zee-> This is what it returns
[04:07:03] <Cork> ya, that isn't valid js
[04:07:52] <Zee-> Well that's how i return from a lot of other methods which are working just fine :/
[04:10:50] <Zee-> Cork what do you think I should return?
[04:11:24] <Cork> firstly you can't return from an ajax callback
[04:11:49] <Cork> but it looks like it want to generate an object so { success: true, phone: callbackPhone }
[04:13:11] <Cork> and if your talking about the data from the server to map to the data variable you use there it would have to return { "d": { "success": true, "phone": callbackPhone } }
[04:13:34] <Zee-> as an example I have this:
[04:14:15] <Zee-> https://pastebin.com/YU2depQa
[04:14:29] <Zee-> and to access the data I use data.d.WhatEverIsInIt
[04:14:34] <Zee-> And the server returns this:
[04:14:48] <Zee-> return new { gps, rssi };
[04:14:58] <Zee-> And that works just fine
[04:15:08] <Cork> Zee-: check in the browser network tab what the server actually returns
[04:15:36] <Cork> server code doesn't say that much when it comes to how the object looks
[04:16:34] <Zee-> There is nothing in response
[04:16:41] <Zee-> Only in Headers
[04:16:45] <Cork> well there you go :)
[04:17:05] <Cork> your server doesn't give a response so the data object won't have d so an exception
[04:18:04] <Zee-> But it's not responding because of what? Before I had a response but it just removed a part of my string
[04:18:39] <Cork> Zee-: all you have given me to go on is that you get code error
[04:18:49] <Cork> i don't know what a valid url should look like so can't really help you there
[04:21:17] <Zee-> Cork it's really not because I'm trying to be an idiot... I just don't understand it.
[04:21:35] <Zee-> If I remove: contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", it fails
[04:21:45] <Cork> Zee-: what i would recommend is 1. use crul command line and make a successfull call to the server
[04:22:06] <Cork> then check the network tab when you do the same thing in ajax and check what differs
[04:22:16] <Zee-> I do have successful call to the server. If I don't remove the ContentType? :/
[04:22:37] <Cork> O_o contentType on a get call?
[04:22:43] <Cork> your server is broken then...
[04:22:58] <Cork> cause body are always empty so contenttype makes no sense
[04:23:00] <Zee-> :/
[04:23:50] <Cork> Zee-: but ya, as it looks like the server doesn't follow the http spec it is up in the air what you should do to make requests work
[04:24:20] <Zee-> Fuck me :/
[04:30:37] <Zee-> Cork: Thx for trying tho!
[04:30:51] <Cork> Zee-: np, sorry i couldn't help more
[04:32:14] <Zee-> Cork well it's some old shit and I have no idea what is wrong with it. What would be the correct way to create a webservice today?
[04:32:33] <Cork> Zee-: what do you mean?
[04:32:51] <Cork> you mean how a request syntax should be?
[04:33:29] <Zee-> I mean which webservice type for ajax calls. If I ever get to rebuild this from scratch... I was once told that .asmx is outdated long ago
[04:34:39] <Cork> Zee-: php for hosted environments, php, python, ruby, go, and so on for where you can run a binray
[04:35:26] <Zee-> Running a asp.net C# webapp
[04:35:41] <Cork> on iis now days it is asp.net or php as far as i know
[04:35:56] <Cork> try to stay away from the windows web platform though :)
[04:36:01] <Cork> trying*
[04:36:56] <Zee-> Okay :)
[04:36:58] <Cork> but ya, if you run it on someone else server your kinda limited to what language they support and; well... that is what you sould use
[04:37:34] <Cork> the server language doesn't matter THAT much as long as the http api is sound
[04:37:53] <Cork> and most ppl to day aim for restful and json
[04:40:01] <Zee-> Well seems like something is broken if you say that contentType in a call method doesn't make sense and it fails if it's not there
[04:41:21] <Cork> contentType is originally a server response header
[04:41:35] <Cork> it is for the server to tell to the client what type of content it sent in the response body
[04:41:54] <Cork> the client can send the same header for ex. when it post json or uploads a file
[04:42:09] <Cork> but only verbs that can actually have a body can have content so...
[04:43:04] <Cork> so for POST, PATCH, PUTS it makes send, but not HEAD or GET, OPTIONS
[04:43:51] <Cork> might be the server doesn't check the verb and expect all requests to be post or something, donno
[04:44:45] <Cork> my main point is you will have to dig deeper into the server, cause the request format you say you need makes no sense
[05:44:09] <Zee-> Cork just had to go for a while. Sorry about that and thank you for the help! :)
[05:46:42] <Cork> Zee-: again, np and yw
[16:12:32] <appleguru> anyone know why the "complete" function of .load in 3.4.1 appears to be firing when the load starts and not when it finishes as it is supposed to?
[16:13:29] <appleguru> (I am loading a .php page that takes ~30seconds to a minute to finish its load/display... but jq seems to fire the complete callback right away and then not again when the load actually finishes)
[16:44:47] <AndroidKitKat> hi there, is there a reason why my 'txt_toggle_btn' doesn't change value the first time it's clicked? here's my html and jquery
[16:44:49] <AndroidKitKat> https://waifupaste.moe/raw/aKQ.html
[16:44:54] <AndroidKitKat> https://waifupaste.moe/raw/4w.txt
[16:45:20] <AndroidKitKat> the function is toggleText()
[16:56:36] <AndroidKitKat> Nevermind i seemed to get it
[16:56:43] <AndroidKitKat> the issue was in my html
[16:56:52] <AndroidKitKat> i had extra whitespace in the span
