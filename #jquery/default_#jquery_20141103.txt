[00:16:39] <J____> Good Morning everybody. Would anyone mind telling me what goes wrong in this fiddle when you hover on one of the blocks for over a second? And if you would be so grand I'd love to know how to fix it as well. http://jsfiddle.net/J___/sL6y3yzx/6/
[00:18:10] <Xatenev> J____ what should go wrong here?
[00:19:13] <J____> If you hover for over a second, I do believe it throws out a error that I don't fully understand.
[00:19:48] <Xatenev> aah now i see
[00:19:53] <Xatenev> Was wondering cause nothing happend :O^^
[00:19:56] <Uhkis> el.position() is not a function
[00:20:16] <J____> But it's a default jquery function thou :o
[00:20:25] <xec> el is not a jquery object
[00:20:54] <Cork> J____: http://jsfiddle.net/sL6y3yzx/7/
[00:21:01] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/sL6y3yzx/8/
[00:21:30] <J____> Multiple fixes :D Super fast early birds today
[00:21:37] <J____> Thnx to both of you lads :D
[00:21:43] <Uhkis> J____: same fix, different row
[00:22:39] <J____> Ah I see I simply forgot to define the $() around the element to clarify it as a jQuery object
[00:22:50] <xec> yep :)
[00:23:17] <Cork> well not clarify
[00:23:21] <Cork> to make it a jquery object
[00:23:29] <Cork> if you don't it's just a dom element
[00:24:37] <J____> I believe I used the wrong term. I think I meant declare instead of clarify ? Either way thanks for the help.
[00:52:35] <eugenmayer> Hello, at which points  .prop('disabled', 'disabled') is not supposed to work? the first i run this, then remove it using removeProp and add it again the same way, it does not get applied - i would have to use attr('disabled','disabled') then .. any ideas?
[00:52:56] <Cork> eugenmayer: never EVER use prop('disabled', 'disabled')
[00:53:03] <Cork> use prop('disabled', true/false)
[00:53:24] <Cork> and don't use removeProp for disabled, checked, selected when we're at it
[00:53:27] <eugenmayer> Cork: tbh, this was a fix for earlier IE version ( 8 i remember )
[00:53:44] <Cork> eugenmayer: no
[00:53:53] <Cork> your thinking of the problem with .attr('disabled')
[00:54:05] <Mark_____> can anyone give me a hand on this? http://dropthebit.com/demos/fancy_input/fancyInput.html
[00:54:17] <Mark_____> i can’t get it working on jsfiddle either.
[00:54:55] <eugenmayer> Cork: wait maybe to maby questions at the same time. the disabled, disabled thingy was a IE8 fix AFAIR .. the attr() thing is just a hack which worked and the reason i ask, because it is not right
[00:55:30] <Cork> eugenmayer: setting attributes to disabled dynamically doesn't work in ie
[00:55:40] <Cork> cause it doesn't have attribute listeners
[00:55:44] <Cork> you have to set the property
[00:55:48] <Cork> and .prop does this
[00:56:04] <Cork> $(elm).prop('disabled', true) === elm.disabled = true
[00:56:12] <Cork> this works all the way back to ie4
[00:56:26] <eugenmayer> Cork: a) what to use with input fields if not disabled (for disabling) b) it clear prop is the way to go, but why it is not working the second time?
[00:57:24] <Cork> eugenmayer: if it doesn't work you have problem somewhere else
[00:57:31] <Cork> .prop('disabled', true) works
[00:57:43] <eugenmayer> does removeProp have any sideeffects?
[00:58:04] <CssNoob> Does it actually require to include CSS ReseT from your stylesheet? http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
[00:58:26] <eugenmayer> interesting, NOT using removeProp but disabled, false - it workes repeatedly. if i use removeProp disabled, prop disabled, true does not work the second time
[00:58:37] <eugenmayer> @Cork ^^
[01:01:16] <eugenmayer> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/kbort42t/
[01:01:25] <eugenmayer> thats basically the issue
[01:01:47] <eugenmayer> while that works: http://jsfiddle.net/by3hehkj/1/
[01:02:14] <Cork> again don' use removeProp
[01:02:31] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/kbort42t/1/
[01:02:41] <eugenmayer> Cork: could you just shortly explain or link why ( so just i understand and remember better )
[01:03:01] <Cork> eugenmayer: you can't remove a state value from a dom element
[01:03:11] <Cork> disabled, checked, selected is special values
[01:03:17] <eugenmayer> so i basically remove the listeneres ?
[01:03:23] <Cork> *magical* properties if you prefer
[01:03:26] <Cork> no
[01:03:30] <Cork> you do a noop
[01:03:35] <Cork> cause the browser will ignore you
[01:03:47] <Cork> well at least a sane one will
[01:03:54] <eugenmayer> at the removeProp thingy? but if he does, while i have issue later on?
[01:04:03] <eugenmayer> (using chrome beta 39 here)
[01:04:07] <Cork> possibly
[01:04:15] <Cork> basically never use removeProp
[01:04:21] <eugenmayer> got that.
[01:04:24] <Cork> i haven't hit a situation to date where i need it
[01:04:27] <eugenmayer> Cork++
[01:04:32] <Cork> .removeAttr is another matter
[01:08:07] <eugenmayer> Cork: so basicaly, if i dont expect events to fire up when changing a XHTML value, i can use attr .. but if i change XML attributes which could have events bound to them like selected / disabled / value, i should use prop?
[01:08:26] <Cork> no
[01:08:33] <eugenmayer> i just want to get those things sorted out once and for all - if you have a second to explain, this would be great
[01:08:44] <Cork> use prop except if you need to get the raw unmodified attribute value
[01:08:54] <Cork> like href
[01:09:20] <eugenmayer> ok, that one is new to me.
[01:09:43] <eugenmayer> so more or less, never even think about attr anymore just if i want to cover a edge-case
[01:09:52] <Cork> there is very few situations where you actually need .attr
[01:10:00] <Cork> yes
[01:10:01] <eugenmayer> interesting - it is used VERY often - even in plugins / libgs AFAICS
[01:10:17] <Cork> ya, cause they most likely lived pre 1.8
[01:10:28] <Cork> or was it 1.7 it was split into attr/prop
[01:10:31] <Cork> don't remember >_<
[01:13:10] <eugenmayer> Cork: well i still mix 1.4 with 1.9.1 ( but namespaced ) due to my framework
[01:13:18] <Cork> ouch
[01:13:40] <eugenmayer> not to easy, since i have to run grunt-tasks on plugins to put those into the 1.9.1 scope using a enlosure
[01:13:48] <Cork> that's an hefty price to pay
[01:14:03] <eugenmayer> Cork: you mean performance wise (runtime? )
[01:14:14] <Cork> that and subtile bugs
[01:14:28] <Cork> as both copies will use the jQuery global variable for plugins
[01:14:30] <eugenmayer> you mean bugs when mixing or 1.4 bugs?
[01:14:34] <Cork> you can get some really weird bugs
[01:14:39] <Cork> mixing
[01:14:47] <eugenmayer> Cork: well i scope it, i bind 1.9.1 to window.newjq
[01:14:51] <Cork> noConflict is for loading jquery with other frameworks
[01:14:53] <Cork> not with it self
[01:15:02] <Cork> eugenmayer: doesn't matter
[01:15:10] <Cork> unless you manually patch plugins
[01:15:13] <eugenmayer> and then use grunt to enclosure every plugin to scope it to window.newjq .. that works 100% bugfree
[01:15:21] <Cork> cause they bind to window.jQuery
[01:15:24] <Cork> hard coded
[01:15:41] <eugenmayer> Cork: well you dont need to patch 99%, an eclusure is enaugh..but more or less i "wrap" the plugin using a grunt task
[01:15:56] <eugenmayer> Cork: very very few use window.jQuery
[01:16:06] <eugenmayer> (i dont have a single one, but i have seen it)
[01:16:11] <Cork> eugenmayer: you mean something like (function(jQuery) {})(window.newjq); ?
[01:16:20] <eugenmayer> jQuery, $
[01:16:28] <Cork> then you have to patch the plugins
[01:16:34] <eugenmayer> yesno
[01:16:48] <Cork> plugins do (functioin($) {})(jQuery) <-- this is why things break
[01:16:53] <Cork> *function
[01:17:17] <eugenmayer> Cork: grunt task (contact) http://pastie.org/9692872
[01:17:38] <Cork> ugg
[01:17:48] <Cork> well as long as i don't have to touch it
[01:17:50] <eugenmayer> Cork: i dont expect you to like it, but i dont have alternatives
[01:17:56] <Cork> you do
[01:18:00] <eugenmayer> no i dont. :)
[01:18:02] <Cork> pick 1.4 or update it
[01:18:16] <Cork> i've been there, done that
[01:18:24] <eugenmayer> Well, it sounds easier then you actually thing
[01:18:28] <Cork> loading two copies of jquery isn't an option for me
[01:18:45] <Erwat> three copies would clearly be much better
[01:19:00] <Cork> or 6+ (seen those >_<)
[01:19:19] <eugenmayer> And i understand you. But just maybe thing about it, dealing wit 2 scopes had some effort and has, and i stilled prefered this before wiping 1.4 and upgrading 1.9.1 - this has not been done without prethoughts
[01:19:31] <Erwat> well if those people get their code into production they have pretty good job security just patching things
[01:19:34] <Cork> 1.7, 1.9, 1.9 again, 1.10 and 1.7 and so on -_-'
[01:19:35] <eugenmayer> this is not a "small" website or "some few plugins" we are talking bout
[01:19:53] <Cork> eugenmayer: i know i do big plugin sites too
[01:20:05] <Cork> but the negative effects of multiple plugins is horrible
[01:20:15] <Cork> *multiple jquery versions
[01:20:18] <eugenmayer> there are none "sideeffects"
[01:20:27] <Cork> that you have noticed yet ya
[01:20:31] <eugenmayer> its just preparation but still, loading to jqs is horrible pain - no doubt
[01:20:40] <eugenmayer> i run this for arround2 years now
[01:20:54] <Cork> and not to forget you basially double your pages memory usage
[01:20:55] <eugenmayer> and well, our customers would have noticed that :)
[01:21:46] <Cork> jquery-1.4 + jquery-1.4-jit version + jquery-1.9 + jquery-1.9-jit version
[01:21:54] <eugenmayer> Cork: yeah, horrible. Well at some point, i will have to jump and upgrade on 1.9.1 - but for now i just go on on and and replace one contrib after the other using the scope, until i have 80% - then i upgrade the last 20% and remove the scopes ( since its automatically, i can jsut remove the task )
[01:21:58] <Cork> that becomes quite a bit of memory
[01:23:07] <eugenmayer> its just an upgrade path, but we are talking about something very big which cannot be done "in one turn"
[01:23:24] <eugenmayer> Btu i take your critics - points taken anyway. I dont really argue about the "badness" :)
[01:23:42] <Cork> eugenmayer: it can, you choosed a different path
[01:23:50] <Cork> and that is your choice to make
[01:23:56] <Cork> but it is really possible
[01:24:16] <eugenmayer> it is, but dont expect to now how many contribs and JS code we are talking about
[01:24:34] <Cork> there is solutions around that
[01:24:37] <eugenmayer> espcially partially unknown, HORRIBLE js crap "code" code which i never have writte
[01:24:48] <Cork> search replace is a grate tool
[01:24:51] <Cork> you should try it :)
[01:25:10] <eugenmayer> Cork: hehe, yeah, i know - i tried that. I have read the guides, but that did not really work out
[01:25:25] <eugenmayer> since the core code is just js-bullshit. Its not JQuery, its jquery badass
[01:25:40] <Cork> uh js-bullshit??
[01:25:43] <eugenmayer> things get horribly broken when you patch that or even tuch it...
[01:26:02] <Cork> sounds like you just need to brush up your language knowledge
[01:26:04] <eugenmayer> i have to rewrite most of those parts - but to be hones i would replace 40 lines with 4 ..
[01:26:21] <eugenmayer> Cork: its not my code.
[01:26:28] <Cork> ok?
[01:26:34] <Uhkis> what's "jquery badass" ? :D
[01:26:45] <Cork> that was my second question
[01:27:08] <Cork> just waited for the answer on the first one :)
[01:27:35] <eugenmayer> that is when you dont follow a single guideline when writing JQ - no eclosures..dont even try to think .css is used… no attr('style'.concat..) you will find
[01:28:02] <sacho_> using .attr() in general indicates a problem with your code.
[01:28:03] <eugenmayer> i will not even show you how events are bind, and if they are, anon binds are _a must_
[01:28:12] <sacho_> there's very few cases when you actually need to set an attribute.
[01:28:25] <Cork> also just pulling random plugins without checking there code is another way to get into a mess like that
[01:28:32] <eugenmayer> sacho_: yeah, i learned that today, but they would then use .prop :) its just "horrible"
[01:29:01] <eugenmayer> Cork: yes, but that is framework legacy code, i cant really change it "right" away - its a public framework
[01:29:03] <sacho_> well, there's nothing specifically wrong with .prop()
[01:29:37] <Cork> i've seen a few .removeAttr('class') makes me cry every time
[01:29:37] <eugenmayer> sacho_: prop('style','') should be wront in nearly 99% of all cases, you will surely admit
[01:29:50] <eugenmayer> Cork: yeah, all those kinds - at one place.
[01:30:07] <eugenmayer> They have written JS-vanillay parts for things ( XHR
[01:30:27] <Cork> eugenmayer: nothing fundamentally wrong with vanilla js
[01:30:36] <eugenmayer> which are perfectly handled by jquery .. more and more to come. Its basically something broken which needs to be thrown away
[01:30:39] <Cork> badly written code is still bad
[01:30:48] <Cork> but vanilla js is often needed for performance
[01:31:05] <Cork> and also can be easy to read if done correctly
[01:31:17] <eugenmayer> Cork: vanilla js is, for most of us, as bad as writing C code without doing it on regulary base / having very good reasons for it
[01:31:28] <Cork> O_o'
[01:31:32] <Cork> what's wrong with c?
[01:31:46] <Cork> man you throw strange comments on a stream here...
[01:31:58] <Erwat> vanilla js is easier for me to read for some reason
[01:32:25] <Cork> as long as it isn't coffiescript then i'm good
[01:32:34] <Cork> i deeply hate coffiescript
[01:32:44] <eugenmayer> there is nothing wrong with C, especially performance wise. But it is not designed very well and you can make a lot of mistakes when not 100% focused during development. People who dont do C regulary basically just produce garbage code and nightmares for maintaince
[01:32:54] <Cork> O_o
[01:32:56] <Cork> it's not?
[01:33:02] <eugenmayer> Cork: i guess we are just different - i use coffescript only.
[01:33:08] <Cork> if you had said c++ i would have agreed
[01:33:11] <Cork> but c???
[01:33:53] <eugenmayer> i admit, c++ has more potential for those issues, C might be just "unhandy" in some fields and, still, you can fk up pointer arithmetics a LOT.
[01:34:05] <larsemil> i can agree on c not being designed very well, in the same way as assembly not being. C is as good as it gets at that level
[01:34:35] <larsemil> i hope we are not compairing C with Coffescript..?
[01:34:42] <Cork> lol
[01:34:44] <Cork> nope
[01:34:48] <larsemil> thanks.
[01:34:52] <larsemil> i was almost having heartattach
[01:35:15] <Cork> it was just my by the way comment about the js language
[01:35:23] <larsemil> heartattach... -h +k... got another meaning..
[01:35:24] <eugenmayer> larsemil: well, no i never would :) I pretty much love Coffescript for what it does for me
[01:37:21] <K4T> Can someone give me some tips how to write better and cleaner that if statement: http://pastebin.com/87rX5ZG8 ?
[01:37:48] <K4T> weak point of that string is line 4 and 12
[01:38:00] <K4T> how I can write it cleaner in JS?
[01:38:13] <Cork> K4T: user a template engine
[01:38:18] <Cork> and move the html out of js
[01:38:57] <eugenmayer> K4T: something like handlebars or similar of taste you like
[01:39:17] <Cork> jqute if you want a small and capable one
[01:39:24] <Cork> or mustach is another option
[01:39:50] <K4T> thx
[01:40:21] <eugenmayer> i would, for your case, rather pick handlebars before mustach for more "convinient" template precompiling
[01:40:29] <Cork> K4T: if you go for jqote make sure to grab jqote2
[01:40:39] <Cork> (typoed before)
[01:41:38] <K4T> ok
[02:37:38] <Trow> hi im storing html content in json
[02:37:38] <Trow> how could i display it in a page correctly
[02:46:17] <Macaveli> When using voiceover all the lines are deemed clickable is it possible to remove this click behaviour in voiceover?
[02:51:56] <Cork> Trow: just .html() or .append() it
[02:52:08] <Cork> Trow: you need to have the needed css for it already loaded though
[02:53:04] <Cork> Macaveli: that question is very offtopic for this channel
[02:53:14] <Cork> you aren't likely to get an answer here
[02:53:14] <Macaveli> Cork not really
[02:53:18] <Macaveli> because there is this
[02:53:34] <Trow> Cork, many thanks
[02:53:52] <Macaveli> https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133613
[02:53:54] <Macaveli> Cork ^
[02:55:37] <Cork> Macaveli: you know you are in jquery right?
[02:55:54] <Cork> none of the questions or links you've given is on topic for this channel
[02:56:42] <Cork> Macaveli: what you linked is a bug in where webkit tells the reader "this is a link" when it shouldn't
[02:56:47] <Cork> this has nothing to do with js
[03:00:13] <maahacka> hey guys, any idea why my this.click() inside of .each() actually fires the click event instead of attaching an event handler?
[03:00:14] <maahacka> http://jsfiddle.net/w2rczz2n/4/
[03:01:30] <Cork> maahacka: this inside an each is a dom element not jquery
[03:01:44] <Cork> if you want to attach an event listener you want $(this).click(func)
[03:02:00] <maahacka> veery nice
[03:02:04] <maahacka> that's what i was fearing
[03:02:10] <maahacka> thanks
[03:02:27] <Mark____> um
[03:02:33] <Mark____> can anyone give me a hand?
[03:02:43] <abailarri> Anyone knows how to to some actions when an ajax call is performing? During tha ajax call
[03:03:23] <Cork> abailarri: you would have to use something to start it as the ajax call starts
[03:03:23] <Mark____> im trying to apply this js, and i got stuck : http://dropthebit.com/demos/fancy_input/fancyInput.html
[03:03:33] <Cork> and then stops it when the .always fires
[03:03:43] <Cork> abailarri: its normal animations
[03:03:46] <Cork> for example
[03:04:03] <maahacka> Cork, so basically I can $(DOMElement) anytime?
[03:04:12] <Cork> maahacka: sure
[03:04:16] <abailarri> call some action when ajax starts and on succes finish the action Cork ?
[03:04:19] <maahacka> thanks
[03:04:56] <Cork> abailarri: yes, startAnimateion(); $.ajax().always(function() { stopAnimation(); });
[03:24:51] <maahacka> I am building a faceted search app and I need some help regarding the JS design
[03:25:08] <maahacka> there are 2 text input fields (what, where) and a submit button
[03:25:41] <maahacka> after one submits the search, in the SERP there is also a hierarchical list of facets (checkbox inputs)
[03:26:11] <maahacka> and basically "onchange" should happen the same as what happens "onsubmit"
[03:26:35] <maahacka> the question is how to design the code so that the "this" object does not get confused?
[03:28:33] <maahacka> in a few words, depending on the entry point (form submit with ENTER, click on SUBMIT or CHANGE of checkbox value) I have to either:
[03:29:03] <maahacka> 1) inject the reading of the facet values into the sumbit() logic;
[03:29:23] <maahacka> or 2) call the form.submit() after reading the facet values
[03:29:56] <Cork> maahacka: noone is going to follow this
[03:30:07] <Cork> make a fiddle if you want comments
[03:30:10] <Cork> ?paste
[03:30:10] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:30:40] <maahacka> I have no code yet, that's the thing
[03:30:46] <maahacka> I don't know how to start
[03:31:33] <maahacka> or, wait
[03:35:46] <maahacka> http://jsfiddle.net/w2rczz2n/9/
[03:36:44] <Cork> ok, and the problem is that...?
[03:38:22] <maahacka> both a click in the facets as well as a form submit should result in a ajax call
[03:38:57] <maahacka> it should be the same logic, so I could attach the same event handler function
[03:39:09] <maahacka> but the problem is that this will refer to different kind of elements in the end
[03:39:14] <maahacka> "this"
[03:39:23] <Cork> bind a submit event handler on the form
[03:39:39] <Cork> and on change on the checkbox do a $(this).closest('form').submit()
[03:40:17] <maahacka> provided that the checkboxes are inside the form?
[03:40:36] <maahacka> hm I see
[03:40:38] <maahacka> thanks
[03:41:12] <ionas> I am looking for something like ExtJS/Sencha Mobile (responsive, multi device): Use Case: Administration Panel, customized workflows, filterable data, live editing, access control relevant - best LGPL/MIT or GPL - low entry learning curve, utf8-multi lang - good documentation - to be used with a MVC web framework - any hints? - would be great if it was based around jquery
[03:41:15] <Cork> maahacka: yes
[03:44:46] <maahacka> ionas, why not Sencha Mobile itself?
[04:14:15] <bee_keeper> hi, i type 'bower install datetimepicker' and bower pulls in datetimepicker and compiles jquery.js in the same directory.  How can i tell it not to bother adding jquery.js with every component i download?
[04:38:48] <Macaveli> How do I remove all click listeners and only add click listeren to body
[04:38:55] <Macaveli> Cork any thoughts?
[04:39:23] <Cork> Macaveli: you can't really
[04:39:38] <Cork> if you know all the function passed to addEventListener
[04:39:39] <Macaveli> how come?
[04:39:44] <Cork> you could loop those and unbind them
[04:39:51] <Cork> cause there isn't a list for events
[04:39:58] <Cork> jquery has one
[04:40:05] <Cork> but only for events added with jquery
[04:40:23] <Cork> it knows nothing about event added with .addEventListener
[04:40:35] <Macaveli> can i do $("p").off("click");?
[04:40:47] <Cork> sure, but only if the click handler was added by jquery
[04:40:58] <Cork> if it is native js it won't do anything
[04:54:23] <riag> hey
[04:54:40] <riag> I have a question about draggables, is this the right place to ask ?
[05:03:43] <Elirips> Hello. Can I update the URL parameters when a user hits F5 or clicks refresh? We have a url like this: http://xy.com?foo=bar . While the user stays on the page, 'bar' gets updated constantly, but only in the script not in the address bar. If the user hits F5 now, he refreshes the page with an outdated 'bar'. So: Can I somehow intercept the refresh and update 'bar'?
[05:07:12] <Cork> Elirips: use window.location.pushState
[05:07:19] <Cork> you can't do this on refresh
[05:07:26] <Cork> but you can do it as you do the change
[05:07:56] <Elirips> Cork: okay thank you. pushState is html5 not?
[05:08:04] <Cork> ex. $('#content').load(url, function() { window.location.pushState('', url) })
[05:08:21] <Cork> Elirips: it is a fairly new api
[05:08:41] <smee> Hello, when appending to a div, I seem to be adding additional </div> tags which then results in "              " appearing in my HTML code
[05:08:42] <Cork> Elirips: and as everything invented under the sun since ~2005 is html5 "yes"
[05:09:11] <Cork> but don't use html5 as a technical term, cause it isn't
[05:09:15] <Elirips> Cork: okay... as we still have to support damn IE8.. :( maybe in 2 years I'll come back to that input :P
[05:09:16] <Cork> its marketing
[05:09:22] <krambiorix> when logged in in my webapplication and close the browser, I open the browser the day after and it shows me the last visited page in the application. When i click something, it guides me to the login page. How can i move to the login page when the browser opens?
[05:09:29] <Cork> Elirips: there is no solution for ie8
[05:09:33] <krambiorix> i think it caches the page (and jquery ajax calls)
[05:09:34] <Cork> except full page reload
[05:09:46] <Cork> or possibly hashbang
[05:10:08] <Cork> http://www.example.com/path/url/test.html => http://www.example.com#!/path/url/test.html
[05:10:18] <Cork> then you can change the "url" in any browser
[05:10:27] <Cork> you will depend on js for the page to work though
[05:10:31] <Elirips> Cork: okay, but then we would also need to change other things
[05:10:59] <Cork> Elirips: ya, my recommendation is to fix it for all modern browsers
[05:10:59] <Elirips> never mind, thanks. I was wondering if there is an easy solution, and yes, with pushState there would be, but I'll start implementing that when the browsers we have to support will support it
[05:11:10] <Cork> and leave ie < 10 with the starting url
[05:11:23] <Elirips> I dont want to change everything (or a lot) to support IE 8 / 9 in the year 2014
[05:11:36] <Cork> ya
[05:11:50] <Cork> so make a nice fix, for the browsers that support it
[05:11:50] <Elirips> sooner or later the last win xp clients are dead and all problems are solved :P
[05:11:54] <Cork> it is a one liner
[05:12:05] <Elirips> yes, we will probably do that
[05:12:06] <Cork> just check if window.location.pushState exists
[05:12:19] <Cork> if it does, push the new url
[05:12:46] <Cork> *progressive enhancement* for the win :)
[05:13:01] <Elirips> hehe :) thx.
[05:13:38] <krambiorix> Cork, any idea?
[05:14:17] <Solcero> Hi, is there a way to use a external url with load() ?
[05:14:30] <Cork> krambiorix: you could try triggering on something like pageShow (i think its called that)
[05:14:37] <Cork> ?mdn pageShow event
[05:14:43] <b-ot> Cork: pageshow - Event reference | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/pageshow
[05:15:03] <Cork> krambiorix: that might give you what you want
[05:15:15] <Cork> Solcero: sure, as long as the remote server support cors
[05:15:36] <Cork> AND is allowing your domain to connect to it through cors
[05:16:57] <krambiorix> Cork, but what should i trigger?
[05:17:23] <Cork> krambiorix: window.location.reload()?
[05:17:30] <Cork> krambiorix: window.location = window.location
[05:17:35] <Cork> depends on what you want to do
[05:17:58] <ThKo> Hi guys, is there a way to get the current id of the page using $( "body" ).pagecontainer( "getActivePage" )? Thanks :)
[05:19:07] <krambiorix> Cork, i want them to move to the loginpage... Now i just need a way to test this...
[05:19:17] <Cork> krambiorix: test what?
[05:19:28] <krambiorix> Cork, pageShow
[05:19:34] <Cork> its an event
[05:19:38] <Cork> not something you test
[05:19:54] <Cork> (and it is all lowercase)
[05:20:44] <krambiorix> Cork, well, i want to test the event
[05:21:01] <Cork> krambiorix: ...
[05:21:05] <Cork> your kidding right?
[05:21:12] <Cork> you don't test events
[05:21:15] <Cork> you bind them
[05:21:20] <krambiorix> Cork, yes of course
[05:21:29] <krambiorix> to test if it works
[05:22:47] <smee> Hello, why is appending a div adding "     " to my HTML?
[05:22:53] <smee> any ideas? :-)
[05:23:14] <xec> smee: do you have a demo where this is happening?
[05:25:09] <encod3> Hi, I'm using PCommerce out of the box with Haulage shipment and Paypal payment, is there anyone using this combination in production?
[05:25:21] <smee> Unfortunately, not one I can share without having to censor. I am using the appendTo function a lot though. It doesn't seem to be causing any layout issues either.
[05:25:28] <Solcero> Cork: that means - if the remote server support cors i can use load with an external url - or i need some function in my script ?
[05:26:06] <Cork> Solcero: the remote server needs to set a cors header allowing you to fetch from them
[05:26:12] <Cork> that is all that is needed
[05:26:14] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[05:26:16] <b-ot> Cork: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[05:26:38] <Solcero> Cork: thx
[05:28:26] <xec> smee: well, for what it's worth you don't usually add anything to *html* - you add to the DOM. arbitrarily adding spaces to the DOM doesn't make much sense on its own, so if you can boil down the issue to a few lines of code it might be possible to see what's going on
[05:28:44] <smee> OK, I'll see if I can get something on jsfiddle
[05:28:53] <smee> @xec - I am appending to a div.
[05:29:04] <xec> appending what?
[05:29:20] <smee> I am putting a new div inside another div
[05:30:01] <smee> $('<div id="addition">to be added</div>).appendTo('#otherDiv');
[05:30:19] <smee> $('<div id="addition">to be added</div>').appendTo('#otherDiv');
[05:30:24] <smee> Missed the '
[05:30:33] <xec> smee: http://jsfiddle.net/vecav75t/
[05:31:23] <smee> What's the difference between doing it that way and using #otherDiv?
[05:31:43] <xec> nothing really
[05:32:05] <maahacka> smee, I think you are missing a $()
[05:32:08] <xec> smee: http://jsfiddle.net/vecav75t/1/
[05:32:28] <xec> maahacka: where, exactly?
[05:33:06] <smee> @xec - see, that works exactly the same, but for some reason in mine it is adding "
[05:33:15] <smee> it is adding "    " into the HTML
[05:33:17] <maahacka> never mind
[05:33:18] <caraconan> Hi there. I would like to have a templating system so I can have a flat html file with a place to substitute variables. Any suggestion? Thanks
[05:33:22] <smee> Only seen when source viewed
[05:33:55] <xec> smee: are you viewing source or inspecting the DOM?
[05:34:02] <gnarf> smee: you mean inspecting the live dom, or view source?  nothing you do at runtime should ever change the "view source"
[05:34:03] <smee> Viewing the source
[05:34:16] <xec> smee: the source only shows whatever the server sent *before js runs*
[05:34:16] <smee> after running
[05:34:25] <gnarf> what xec said
[05:34:27] <smee> Ah, no, then I must be looking at the DOM
[05:34:42] <smee> I'm using Chrome and looking at 'Elements'
[05:34:48] <gnarf> thats inspecting the live dom
[05:35:00] <gnarf> view source is right click view source :)
[05:35:36] <gnarf> smee: can you take a screenshot of the div before/after ?
[05:35:39] <smee> Yeah, so it must be in the DOM
[05:35:41] <xec> smee: ok i think we're on the same page then. you're looking at the DOM. if you look at the DOM in that jsfiddle do you see the same result?
[05:35:42] <gnarf> in the inspector?
[05:35:44] <smee> Sure
[05:37:04] <gnarf> also, the exact code that you're using to append?
[05:37:13] <Xatenev> Question:
[05:37:45] <Xatenev> Nvm no question
[05:37:52] <Xatenev> just solved it myself while i was writing the problem down.. :D
[05:37:55] <xec> lol
[05:38:15] <smee> It's appearing like this in DOM: http://jsfiddle.net/qvw5orko/
[05:38:19] <Xatenev> Happens sooo often :D
[05:38:21] <xec> Xatenev: there's a term for that, rubber duck debugging :)
[05:38:28] <Xatenev> *googlingÜ
[05:38:35] <smee> div id two is the one that has been appended
[05:38:49] <smee> So, that's what I see once the script has run.
[05:39:00] <Xatenev> Ah hahah
[05:39:08] <Xatenev> I definetly need a duck.
[05:41:26] <Xatenev> Somebody sends me a duck? =(
[05:42:33] <smee> Hmm, but the "   " don't appear on the page like they do on JSFiddle
[05:42:35] <xec> Xatenev: here you go http://www.looelions.co.uk/duckrace/images/rubberduck.gif
[05:42:45] <Xatenev> Ty :)
[05:42:59] <xec> smee: yeah that's just the inspector letting you know there's a text node there.
[05:43:51] <smee> So I can just ignore it?
[05:44:05] <xec> most likely
[05:44:22] <smee> Ahhh, great.
[05:44:27] <smee> Thanks for your help xec!
[05:54:10] <giuseppesolinas> hello
[05:54:42] <giuseppesolinas> I have to use this effect for a page http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/05/22/inspiration-for-article-intro-effects/
[05:55:09] <giuseppesolinas> now, I need to block the page from going back to the intro when scrolled to the top
[05:55:09] <zagaza> hi guys.. how can I chain this? when I click on a menu item which has an href to an accordion div, and when it scrolls down there.. it should open the accordion.. if anyone knows what I mean
[05:55:33] <giuseppesolinas> (overflow css doesn't do the trick on mobile devices)
[05:56:00] <Macaveli> Cork  I would love for you to enlighting something I don't understand. This code adds all the clickable events it is jqPagination.  https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/eec43d8b0c876983bdc9
[05:56:46] <Cork> no
[05:57:06] <Cork> that code instantiates a bunch of objects
[05:57:14] <Cork> it doesn't bind a single event
[06:11:21] <Macaveli> Cork this adds all the click events -> https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/96c7dfdcffcb0c2c8d63
[06:28:54] <jnhghy> I'm trying to add a combobox (from jquery-ui - autocomplete ) inside a <td> element but the right part of the autocomplete (the <a> element that has the small down arrow) it's not stying inside the <td> it's exiting it ... I saw it has a position: absolute  that if I disable it will bring it inside the <td> (and enlarge the <td> - which is fine) but it also breaks the css ... any idea how I can fix this?
[06:29:03] <MagmaRules> Hi there, im trying to extend this plugin: https://github.com/awnry/jquery-picklist but i cant seem to be able to use the events triggered. Where should i bind the events ?
[06:29:38] <Cork> jnhghy: make a jsfiddle
[06:30:18] <Cork> MagmaRules: you mean the events triggered with self._trigger?
[06:30:28] <MagmaRules> Cork: yes
[06:30:46] <Cork> MagmaRules: check $.picklist('widget')
[06:30:56] <Cork> it'll give you the correct element
[06:31:19] <MagmaRules> unn $.picklist seems to be undefined
[06:31:38] <Cork> MagmaRules: i meant when the plugin is ran on an element
[06:31:46] <MagmaRules> ok
[06:31:48] <Cork> so $('selector').picklist('widget')
[06:32:23] <MagmaRules> k will try that
[06:34:59] <MagmaRules> Cork: nop, same thing the events get bound to the select and then not triggered
[06:35:33] <Cork> MagmaRules: so .picklist('widget') returns the <select> element?
[06:35:44] <MagmaRules> Cork: yes
[06:36:03] <Cork> then ya self._trigger should fire on that element
[06:36:26] <Cork> make a demo on jsfiddle if you need help debugging
[06:36:32] <MagmaRules> ok
[06:39:30] <Koopz> while($('input[name="foo[' + number + '][bar]]"').length)
[06:39:50] <Koopz> Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[name="foo[0][bar]]"
[06:40:33] <Koopz> i already tried double-backslashing the square brackets in the name
[06:40:42] <Koopz> same error
[06:40:52] <Koopz> any suggestions?
[06:41:36] <MagmaRules> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/tgo0qgdh/
[06:41:50] <beak> koopz: you have not closed a square bracket
[06:42:05] <Koopz> oh...
[06:42:11] <Koopz> misplaced quote
[06:42:14] <Koopz> gimme a sec...
[06:43:09] <Koopz> works like a charm...
[06:43:38] <Koopz> i hate it when these things happen..
[06:44:54] <jnhghy> Cork: I've tried to do a jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/cd8qa2fh/ but as you can see ... it's not outputing as the example here: https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html in my website it's outputing like on the jqueryui.com example but it's not making <td> element stretch ...
[06:46:41] <Cork> jnhghy: you mean the height problem with the dropdown arrow?
[06:50:24] <Cork> jnhghy:
[06:50:26] <Cork> opps
[06:50:44] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/cd8qa2fh/1/
[06:51:32] <Cork> jnhghy: they use position: absolute; to get the element to adjust to the height of the input element
[06:51:44] <Cork> so you need to account for the space needed for the arrow
[06:51:57] <jnhghy> Cork: in the jsfiddle the combobox doesn't output correctly ... I don't know why ... I can't duplicate the one from jquery on jsfiddle (I can on my website ... but the <td> is crossed here is a screenshot: http://imagebin.ca/v/1fydALKQsarg
[06:52:10] <Cork> it looks fine here
[06:52:29] <Cork> did you check the /1/ version?
[06:52:57] <jnhghy> Cork: /1/version ? how? where?
[06:53:07] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/cd8qa2fh/1/ <--
[06:53:24] <jnhghy> Cork: ok ... now I see it ...
[06:55:51] <jnhghy> Cork: can you have a quick look at the link with the screenshot? http://imagebin.ca/v/1fydALKQsarg  is that caused by the table? I don't get it why in that case the dropdown <a> is exiting the <td>
[06:56:12] <Cork> see my comments 5 mins ago
[06:56:19] <Cork> i've already answered this
[06:57:07] <jnhghy> Cork: so padding-right: 2.4em; should do the trick ...
[06:57:12] <jnhghy> Cork: thanks ...
[06:57:32] <Cork> np
[07:09:26] <hackal> Hello is there a general selector for all headings or should I just use "h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6"?
[07:11:16] <CaptainJamy>  I'm trying to get this jQuery validation plugin working, however because my input names have brackets in them it isn't working. Here is a jfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/VuPPy/2076/
[07:15:36] <decx> put it in quotes
[07:19:34] <Koopz> that moment when you try to replicate a problem in jsfiddle and shit works
[07:26:39] <r3v3rb> erm, is code.jquery.com down?
[07:28:13] <Koopz> r3v3rb, site loads
[07:29:10] <r3v3rb> but what about code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js
[07:29:30] <hackal> hello, does the .children() function works only on first level children?
[07:29:42] <r3v3rb> Koopz?
[07:30:34] <thaifood> Can you gents tell me how to listen to a button by class please?  my lines 3-5 are not working.  http://laravel.io/bin/REbm6
[07:31:00] <thaifood> i guess this is event delegation ?
[07:31:34] <abailarri> anyone can help me? I want to know becase my selector is not working http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Ltlzc?editors=101
[07:32:02] <Koopz> r3v3rb, works for me too
[07:33:44] <Koopz> thaifood, use $(this).data("depid")
[07:34:01] <Koopz> you don't need the data-prefix when using .data()
[07:34:06] <thaifood> and keep my listener the same ?
[07:34:22] <Koopz> sure why not?
[07:34:26] <r3v3rb> Koopz: strange, chokes on loading here
[07:34:52] <thaifood> i get undefined
[07:34:53] <Koopz> thaifood, as long as those buttons aren't being generated after the document loaded
[07:34:59] <thaifood> they are though
[07:35:09] <Koopz> well in that case...
[07:35:10] <thaifood> an ajax call makes them
[07:35:22] <mooncup> er
[07:35:26] <mooncup> the jquer cdn is down
[07:35:27] <thaifood> sorry i didn't mention that
[07:35:33] <mooncup> the internet is breaking
[07:35:33] <mooncup> D:
[07:35:47] <Koopz> erm... though the listener is already using delegation...
[07:35:53] <r3v3rb> mooncup: thats what I thought
[07:37:04] <mooncup> r3v3rb: use google instead for now
[07:37:14] <r3v3rb> googleapis ?
[07:37:36] <r3v3rb> mooncup: okay, its was for a production site ! not handy
[07:37:37] <mooncup> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js
[07:37:45] <mooncup> change that to w/e
[07:37:59] <mooncup> or download a copy and host it with your site
[07:38:06] <r3v3rb> going to host safer
[07:38:09] <r3v3rb> ;)
[07:38:17] <r3v3rb> if its there - its there!
[07:38:19] <Koopz> ^ i always do that
[07:38:38] <Koopz> why would i want to use CDNs?
[07:38:42] <r3v3rb> Koopz: I used to but everywhere i went on the interwebs its stated use cdn cdn cdn
[07:38:55] <r3v3rb> so i switched for this one site
[07:39:04] <r3v3rb> arghhh only gets 6k hits a day
[07:39:06] <arschmitz> r3v3rb: what is not loading code seems fine to me
[07:39:09] <r3v3rb> :)
[07:39:20] <r3v3rb> arschmitz: must be a netsplit somewhere
[07:39:49] <Guest22589> http://code.jquery.com not loading for me
[07:39:53] <Koopz> thaifood, are you sure this doesn't work? 'cause your listener is already using delegation
[07:40:00] <mooncup> arschmitz: http://code.jquery.com os definately down
[07:40:07] <mooncup> have you tried refreshing?
[07:40:17] <decx> is not
[07:40:23] <Koopz> nope
[07:40:31] <arschmitz> mooncup: http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/code.jquery.com.html
[07:40:31] <decx> isp or ixp failure maybe
[07:40:37] <Koopz> probably
[07:41:32] <thaifood> i get the alert but not the value  http://laravel.io/bin/Yydwy
[07:42:12] <Koopz> #deps-table-body is wron
[07:42:54] <MoleMan> mooncup: what ISP are you trying from?
[07:43:07] <mooncup> talktalk
[07:43:11] <Koopz> $("#deps-table-body").on('click', ".deldep", function(){});
[07:43:17] <mooncup> it's not just me reporting it though
[07:43:40] <mooncup> maybe it's just in europe/uk?
[07:43:46] <decx> fine from germany
[07:43:48] <Koopz> germany works fine
[07:43:52] <mooncup> hm
[07:43:55] <mooncup> uk only possibly
[07:44:01] <mooncup> how many mirrors do they have?
[07:44:02] <decx> but i do have problems with it from time to time
[07:44:03] <Guest22589> I'm from UK, it's not working for me
[07:44:06] <decx> that's why i use google cdn
[07:44:18] <decx> that one is in more browsercaches anyway
[07:44:23] <Guest22589> few peoples on the twitter with the same issue
[07:44:24] <Guest22589> https://twitter.com/PatrickKunka/status/529296599881908224
[07:44:24] <b-ot> Guest22589: @PatrickKunka: @jquery your CDN at http://t.co/H6OGWCp9uB is down from within the UK

[07:45:55] <thaifood> ooh got it, thx Koopz  !!!!
[07:46:05] <Koopz> thaifood, np ;)
[07:46:25] <thaifood> you rock
[07:47:14] <hackal> Hello is there a way to target ALL children of element (+ all grand children and their grandchildren and so on)?
[07:47:51] <decx> well there is find('*') but yuk
[07:48:09] <decx> there's also contents() if you dont mind sifting through textnodes
[07:48:50] <SDBlumire> is the code website down
[07:48:52] <SDBlumire> can't seem to curl it
[07:49:07] <decx> uk?
[07:49:16] <hackal> actually I need to target all Headings in one div, but they are also nested in other elements... :(
[07:49:17] <SDBlumire> yeah
[07:49:22] <SDBlumire> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js times out indefinately in UK
[07:49:48] <decx> confirmed from other uk people
[07:49:52] <SDBlumire> god damn it
[07:49:55] <SDBlumire> someone fire someone at BT
[07:50:00] <Guest22589> looks like code.jquery.com is back
[07:50:04] <SDBlumire> yep
[07:50:12] <SDBlumire> I just started sending 1000's of browser requests lol
[07:50:13] <SDBlumire> all at once
[07:50:14] <SDBlumire> haha
[07:50:26] <SDBlumire> So basically bt screwed something up
[07:50:26] <decx> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js
[07:50:27] <SDBlumire> and now it's fixed
[07:50:28] <SDBlumire> gg
[07:52:37] <gnarf> playing around with cross window stuff today, does anyone have a favorite guide for postMessage / cross-window workflows other than MDN and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage ?
[07:53:09] <gnarf> I remember BT blocked code.jquery.com like a few months ago
[07:53:29] <decx> so it stands for bollocks telecom?
[07:53:44] <MoleMan> what makes people say BT?
[07:54:08] <MoleMan> also, screw however fixed it, seconds before I was about to make a change to source from Google...
[07:54:18] <decx> do it anyway
[07:54:28] <MoleMan> well, nah, good on them for fixing it, but bah humbug
[07:54:33] <decx> dat cache penetration
[07:55:28] <jeffreylevesque_> hi
[07:55:43] <jeffreylevesque_> what's the best way to display another ajax form based on a previous submission?
[07:56:07] <MoleMan> decx: nah, I would but it's not my code/project
[07:56:11] <jeffreylevesque_> build the second form entire in js, and create it upon successful submission of the first form?
[08:08:28] <sives> The other day I found a site using some JS to make landscape and portrait photos the same size, making it a nice looking gallery I guess. Is there a name for this type of plugin? Usually I would just check the source for the plugin name, but the site was made with Squarespace = mess.
[08:08:46] <decx> what like flickr?
[08:08:57] <bbclover> hey guys, how would one select all <li>s in a list that didn't have an <a> tag in them? Is there a way better than just adding a class selector on all list elements that don't have a link manually?
[08:09:04] <sives> Yes sir
[08:09:11] <Rogerz> @dutch_kazatel yo
[08:09:24] <decx> sives i used this, it's small and concise http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/
[08:09:33] <wa5ted> bbclover: is there a waythat you can add classes to these no alink containing lis
[08:09:39] <sives> Cheers bud
[08:09:41] <decx> on no bs that i've see
[08:09:42] <decx> n
[08:09:56] <decx> and plays well with infinite scrolling
[08:09:58] <bbclover> wa5ted well I meant manually
[08:10:02] <sives> Sweet :)
[08:10:19] <bbclover> like actually in the html modify things but yeah
[08:11:10] <bbclover> I guess I could do something like $('li') and then foreach check if .html contains <a ?
[08:11:15] <bbclover> as a string
[08:11:33] <bbclover> or '<a href='
[08:11:34] <wa5ted> bbclover: hmmmm there might be a way to do it with a selector
[08:11:48] <wa5ted> bbclover: can you whip up a fiddle
[08:11:55] <wa5ted> then i can take a crack
[08:12:45] <decx> $('li').filter(function(){ return !$(this).find('a').length })
[08:13:06] <wa5ted> ^ there you go
[08:13:13] <bbclover> wa5ted: I found this too actually: http://jsfiddle.net/Yottabyte/zdbcoym7/
[08:13:18] <decx> or $('li').has('a')
[08:13:23] <decx> but i like filter ^^
[08:13:44] <wa5ted> bbclover: read decx solution
[08:13:54] <bbclover> yeah, I am
[08:14:03] <decx> these expressions pollute the selector i dont like it
[08:20:40] <DevAntoine> hi
[08:20:44] <DevAntoine> I've got an issue with deferred
[08:21:32] <DevAntoine> let's say I have var a, b. Both affected to a $.get(). When I do $.when(a, b).then(foo), foo is executed before promises are resolved
[08:21:44] <DevAntoine> what am I missing?
[08:24:47] <ccmonster> i have some a links which generate report downloads.
[08:25:16] <robertmaxrees> DevAntoine are you just passing the name of the foo function, or are you doing .then(foo()) ?
[08:25:28] <ccmonster> is there a way to generically attach to the click/backend response for the sake of a loading div etc?
[08:26:14] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: it was just an example, but I'm passing an anonymous function
[08:27:09] <robertmaxrees> DevAntoine have you tried passing all three args to the callback and seeing what the textStatus is?
[08:28:10] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: three args? You mean both of my calls?
[08:28:19] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[08:28:42] <robertmaxrees> the function passed to .then() has three args.
[08:29:13] <robertmaxrees> $.when(a, b).then(function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) { console.log(textstatus) });
[08:29:17] <robertmaxrees> you want to do something like this.
[08:29:30] <robertmaxrees> also make sure a and be are both deferreds/promises.
[08:30:26] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: well, I'm not sure about it, that's the point. Maybe I'm doing it wrong
[08:30:43] <DevAntoine> I declared undefined variable, then both of them are affected to a $.get call
[08:30:54] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ DevAntoine
[08:30:55] <b-ot> DevAntoine: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:30:57] <DevAntoine> but the $.get doc says it returns a promise
[08:31:11] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're doing something weird.
[08:31:16] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: it won't be functionnal
[08:31:19] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter
[08:33:05] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/tihevowiro/1/
[08:33:39] <FoolsRun> Hello, I'm missing something obvious: I'm trying to load chart.js in the footer of my site, and it's throwing errors because I'm calling the Chart function before the footer loads. How do I fix this?
[08:34:05] <robertmaxrees> FoolsRun call the chart function after you load chart.js
[08:34:09] <robertmaxrees> or move chart.js to your head.
[08:34:15] <robertmaxrees> DevAntoine get the .then() calls off the two gets.
[08:34:58] <FoolsRun> robertmaxrees: is there another way? Wrapping the chart up in Query(document).ready(function($) { maybe?
[08:35:31] <robertmaxrees> FoolsRun that only guarantees that the document is ready, not that your script has loaded.
[08:35:38] <robertmaxrees> should be safe, but not guaranteed.
[08:35:46] <robertmaxrees> you could also move your script after the chart.js inclue.
[08:35:48] <robertmaxrees> *include
[08:36:03] <robertmaxrees> DevAntoine you're assigning ordersPromise and requestsPromise to the result of the callbacks in the .then() calls, not the $.get() calls
[08:36:04] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: same issue
[08:36:56] <robertmaxrees> DevAntoine take it a step further and remove the other callbacks.
[08:37:03] <robertmaxrees> do it should just be var ordersPromise = $.get($ordersTable.attr('data-url'));
[08:38:10] <FoolsRun> robertmaxrees: alright, tahnks
[08:38:53] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: I'm still having the then resolves before everything else is done
[08:39:17] <robertmaxrees> DevAntoine try this: http://fixee.org/paste/0qpuxy0/
[08:39:24] <robertmaxrees> what does that get you?
[08:41:24] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: it seems to work
[08:41:29] <robertmaxrees> DevAntoine there you go.
[08:41:37] <wa5ted> rblackwe: yo
[08:41:41] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: yo
[08:41:59] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: but how do I manage to  do some other stuff when individual calls are done?
[08:42:09] <DevAntoine> you know, like when I had chained .then to my calls
[08:42:33] <robertmaxrees> DevAntoine inside of your .then() call on that .when()
[08:42:49] <robertmaxrees> sup rohan ;)
[08:42:52] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: wut?
[08:43:53] <robertmaxrees> DevAntoine the .when() docs show you how.
[08:43:57] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: wiat how do oyu know my real name
[08:44:23] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted because of your host?
[08:45:08] <wa5ted> true
[08:46:34] <wa5ted> grafi: yo
[08:47:11] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: like this? http://fixee.org/paste/0lcoe42/
[08:47:24] <robertmaxrees> no.
[08:48:06] <DevAntoine> :(((
[08:48:29] <robertmaxrees> the docs show you exactly what you need to do.
[08:48:54] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/0lcoe42/#url=s6wmd7p
[08:48:57] <robertmaxrees> it'll look something like this.
[08:49:06] <robertmaxrees> you want .done(), not .then() btw.
[08:49:08] <P0rk> with the expression function in jquery, do I need to evaluate every element in the collection passed and return true for ALL elements or ANY elements? $.expr(":").empty=function(elem) { return ,,,,?
[08:51:32] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: ain't the done executed only after all promises are resolved?
[08:52:27] <robertmaxrees> DevAntoine i'm confused about what you actually need.
[08:53:34] <shoky> P0rk: only one element will be passed, i believe. just return true or false
[08:53:34] <DevAntoine> robertmaxrees: well, I want to do some work directly when ajax calls are resolved and then I want to do some calculations when all ajax calls are resolved
[08:54:33] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/j7ddxs9/ basically, P0rk
[09:00:34] <P0rk> sorry, phone call. Thanks for the replies. in the O'reilly book on Jquery, they use the form $.expr(":").value=function (el) {return $(el)..... making me think that it might be like $.fn.function() { ....   where 'this' is jquery itself...or something like that---I get that all confused.
[09:01:34] <P0rk> Oh, wait. I see. you did use the element el.value   not $(el).val()   got it
[09:01:38] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:01:45] <robertmaxrees> though you can do either.
[09:01:54] <robertmaxrees> $ is available in there.
[09:02:07] <robertmaxrees> check out the function's signature - function(el, idx, selector)
[09:02:10] <P0rk> so the expression is being passed the element, not a jquery object....got it
[09:02:30] <robertmaxrees> el is the first arg, can you could pass that to $() to get the jquery object if you wanted.
[09:03:06] <P0rk> idx, the second is the index
[09:03:24] <P0rk> :value(3) would evaluate the fourth element
[09:04:15] <P0rk> like :nth-child(3) for example.
[09:07:24] <shoky> :value(3)  would match elements whose value is 3
[09:08:11] <P0rk> yeah. I was just reading about signature. I don't know that I get what idx is...what is idx in this case?
[09:08:50] <decx> i dont like expressions anymore
[09:08:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:09:02] <decx> all filter all the time
[09:09:27] <P0rk> really? is it better? I can do that pretty easily..
[09:09:53] <decx> it pollutes the selector and cant be cached as easily
[09:10:08] <P0rk> is filter better than css pseudo-selectors or just jquery expressions?
[09:10:19] <P0rk> I see
[09:10:27] <decx> well pseudo selectors still have the css perf benefit, expressions do not
[09:10:28] <robertmaxrees> i generally prefer working with methods like filter.
[09:10:35] <decx> they are basicly just filter with a dress
[09:10:58] <robertmaxrees> the extra cognitive overhead for your fellow devs usually makes me avoid expressions and stuff.
[09:11:16] <P0rk> do you guys work with teams of developers?
[09:12:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[09:12:37] <robertmaxrees> around 30 devs at my place.
[09:13:23] <P0rk> I need that. It is a lot better to have other devs to work with so you have a greater allegiance to standards and legibility and get less caught up in your own choices.
[09:14:13] <robertmaxrees> also have like 5 or 6 QA folks.
[09:14:17] <P0rk> I work by myself on little projects and don't have the constraints of "making it nice for other developers" though I try to adhere to what I learn here.
[09:14:17] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, structure is good.
[09:14:42] <robertmaxrees> make it nice for you in that case.
[09:15:08] <shoky> you in a few months === other developer  ;p
[09:15:12] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[09:15:36] <P0rk> hmm. Yeah. I have looked recently at some of my original sites and laughed and laughed.
[09:16:16] <P0rk> I am the world all-time greatest at making things more difficult than they ever need to be with the thought that I am being thorough...lol
[09:16:41] <robertmaxrees> hahaha, you'll learn how to not do that with tiume.
[09:16:47] <robertmaxrees> usually all about knowing your tools
[09:17:06] <nicetry> hello, I'm looking for a .two() like .one() - does it exist or do you just have to make it yourself within a '.on'
[09:17:35] <robertmaxrees> make it yourself.
[09:17:35] <decx> make it yourself
[09:17:46] <nicetry> thanks guys
[09:17:49] <robertmaxrees> OR
[09:17:52] <decx> save the number in data()
[09:18:01] <robertmaxrees> be really smart and always use .on() and conditionally run your logic.
[09:18:20] <decx> well that counts as "make it yourself"
[09:18:34] <robertmaxrees> just sayin' to not do .one().
[09:18:38] <shoky> i actually considered for a second if .one().one()  would do it ;D
[09:18:44] <robertmaxrees> :(
[09:18:58] <decx> i use one for the init trick
[09:19:09] <decx> that's about it
[09:19:26] <nicetry> you guys don't like .one eh?
[09:19:32] <aracodex123> hi ladies and gents, a quick CSS qn. Why is it that when we use perspective and translate, we calculate them in pixels rather than factors i.e. factor of 1 / 2/ 3 etc. ?
[09:19:42] <shoky> i like the use of .one  here  http://jqueryui.com/button/#splitbutton
[09:19:46] <shoky> that's about it ;p
[09:20:06] <robertmaxrees> nicetry i don't like playing with event bindings.
[09:20:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm very ronco about it - set it and forget it.
[09:21:00] <robertmaxrees> manage logic, not bindings.
[09:24:35] <P0rk> ronco++ lol
[09:28:13] <nicetry> robertmaxrees: that sounds awesome and simpler, but I can't honestly say I follow you. it seems like there are lots of asks that require binding to events which can't be re-organized into logic
[09:28:55] <robertmaxrees> nicetry really depends on how you're building things, but I tend to prefer to hold state elsewhere and check that state in my logic.
[09:30:52] <nicetry> hmmm
[09:52:24] <definity> anyone here use masonry?
[10:16:42] <ratbuddy__> regarding my code here: http://pastebin.com/dQwnUD2D the .attr(checked, true) part works fine, and checks the radio button when overview-type-selection just fine, but the two lines I have commented out .. they are screwing things up
[10:16:56] <robertmaxrees> .prop(), not .attr()
[10:17:44] <robertmaxrees> also, if (($('input[name=overview]:checked', '#overview-form').val()) == "yes") { likely isn't doing what you want.,
[10:18:26] <ratbuddy__> I was trying to select the element on change, then if it was changed to 'yes' do one thing, and if not, do something else
[10:19:01] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle showing what you're doing?
[10:19:32] <ratbuddy__> let me try
[10:23:40] <Solcero> hi, i got a website with .load( ) - but the src of the images are wrong. i have to append http://mydomain.org/ to src - is this possible ?
[10:23:43] <ratbuddy__> http://jsfiddle.net/11excpvy/ but it seems to work there
[10:23:53] <ratbuddy__> I guess I just needed to change from attr to prop
[10:24:27] <robertmaxrees> Solcero syure - use .each()
[10:24:43] <robertmaxrees> ratbuddy__ 9/10 times you want .prop() instead of attr.
[10:24:49] <ratbuddy__> gotcha
[10:25:38] <ratbuddy__> just tested on the local server and it works fine with prop.. thanks, robert
[10:25:42] <robertmaxrees> deffo
[10:25:54] <robertmaxrees> take another look at that if btw.
[10:26:10] <Solcero> robertmaxrees: thx i try
[10:31:16] <engaged> I have a link on a page like <a href=“/link.php” id=“link” target=“_new”>TEST</a> and then with jquery on #link i do a .click() with a window.location = “/link2.php”. On iphone it only does that link2.php in the same tab and does not open link.php in a new tab or open it all for that matter, every other browser it works fine and on desktop works fine… any clue?
[10:31:51] <robertmaxrees> there is no such thing as _new
[10:31:54] <robertmaxrees> you want _blank
[10:32:05] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/4964223/923919
[10:33:08] <robertmaxrees> wait why are you using javascript to open a link like that?
[10:34:15] <engaged> because i need to open one in the current tab and one in a new tab… is there a better way?
[10:34:27] <robertmaxrees> err... why?
[10:35:47] <engaged> because i have to… ignore the why… focus on the how
[10:35:56] <robertmaxrees> err.
[10:36:12] <robertmaxrees> no need to be rude, but OK ;)
[10:36:38] <engaged> not being rude, just i need to open 2 links, 1 in current window and 1 in new window with focus on new window
[10:36:53] <robertmaxrees> you cannot guarnatee the focus btw
[10:37:02] <robertmaxrees> that's browser-defined behavior.
[10:38:14] <robertmaxrees> but you want something like this http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/crp081sc/2/
[10:38:35] <decx> good lord
[10:38:42] <robertmaxrees> hacky and weird thing to want to do.
[10:39:30] <decx> isnt that the same as just having iwndow.open an no preventdefault or location
[10:39:30] <decx> ^^
[10:39:56] <robertmaxrees> eh, i get weird about relying on things happening with links.
[10:40:05] <robertmaxrees> unpredictable imo.
[10:41:51] <ratbuddy__> robert, what is wrong with the if?
[10:42:34] <robertmaxrees> ratbuddy__ you're selecting multiple elements.  .val() will only get the value of the first thing matched.
[10:43:12] <ratbuddy__> even if there is only one thing called overview-form?
[10:44:07] <engaged> robertmaxrees: target=“_blank” and target=“_new” both don’t work on iphone..
[10:44:16] <ratbuddy__> I really just need to sit down and learn jquery :P right now I just wing it because my job is 99.8% 'other stuff' and .2% jquery
[10:44:19] <robertmaxrees> ratbuddy__ oooh you're using the .find() shortcut.  ignore me.
[10:44:46] <robertmaxrees> engaged _new isn't a thing and wasn't ever a thing.  did you look at the fiddle i pasted?
[10:45:04] <engaged> yes but that is not what i wanted
[10:45:13] <engaged> i want the link you click to open in new window
[10:45:36] <engaged> if i get rid of the javacript window.location it opens in new window/tab just fine on iphone
[10:47:27] <robertmaxrees> maybe this then? http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/crp081sc/3/
[10:47:28] <robertmaxrees> not sure
[10:47:46] <robertmaxrees> sounds like ios doesn't like you trying to open windows automatically.
[10:48:32] <Ceterizine> Why does this return typeError? $('.replay.replay_title')[0].text()
[10:48:43] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to run .text() on a non-jquery object.
[10:48:47] <robertmaxrees> .eq(0) instead.
[10:49:02] <Ceterizine> ah
[10:49:04] <Ceterizine> Cool thanks
[11:00:43] <Solcero> robertmaxrees: i'am not really sure how its work with the each function - like that ? https://gist.github.com/Solcero/e73d54d475197698ec59
[11:00:58] <robertmaxrees> $('a').each()
[11:03:03] <robertmaxrees> err, wait
[11:03:20] <robertmaxrees> $(result).find('a').each()
[11:03:21] <robertmaxrees> like that
[11:04:06] <doug64k> Solcero: what is each 'src' supposed to mean. did you want to modify the href on one or more 'a' tags?
[11:05:56] <doug64k> oops, src on 'img' tags, not 'href' on 'a' tags
[11:11:06] <engaged> robertmaxrees: if i add a delay, even 50ms to the window.location after the .click() it works fine in iphone/safari
[11:11:33] <robertmaxrees> that's hacky.
[11:11:35] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[11:12:11] <doug64k> lol https://gist.github.com/doug65536/01de6da1c05612a3db58   he left :(
[11:12:26] <doug64k> why doesn't this work..... bye!
[11:12:48] <robertmaxrees> it happens
[11:13:30] <doug64k> oops, forgot to + src. oh well lol
[11:17:21] <Solcero> doug64k: img src
[11:17:44] <doug64k> Solcero: still not too sure what you need but is this close? https://gist.github.com/doug65536/01de6da1c05612a3db58
[11:18:23] <robertmaxrees> I wouldn't do  $('[src]', getdata).each(function(){ btw
[11:18:42] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: why not
[11:18:50] <robertmaxrees> src can exist on more than just images.
[11:19:02] <robertmaxrees> also attribute selectors make me feed gross.
[11:19:06] <doug64k> I was just getting to that. was saying use img[src]
[11:19:19] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: why?
[11:19:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd do just 'img' and then check if the source prop exists
[11:19:40] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: sounds like FUD to me. have a reason?
[11:19:52] <robertmaxrees> they can be unexpectedly slow.
[11:19:56] <robertmaxrees> i find them harder to read.
[11:20:13] <decx> if there's context and a leading tag it's negligible
[11:20:16] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: on a subtree of the dom? how big are these hypothetical .load results
[11:20:23] <robertmaxrees> just sayin'.
[11:20:23] <decx> ^ that
[11:20:26] <robertmaxrees> i tend to avoid them.
[11:20:33] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: you think it invoking a lot of js callbacks is faster than evaluating an attribute filter?
[11:20:41] <robertmaxrees> reread what i said.
[11:20:44] <robertmaxrees> I also find them harder to read.
[11:20:45] <robertmaxrees> others might now.
[11:20:47] <robertmaxrees> *not
[11:21:06] <doug64k> ok... just want to be sure it isn't motivated by premature optimization :)
[11:21:12] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:22:43] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: I try to keep my selectors fast, but I also take into consideration that a .load is probably not loading in an awful lot of data, and if it is, then loading an awful lot of data takes time anyway, and the reflow will probably take orders of magnitude more time than a src attribute filter
[11:23:03] <robertmaxrees> i see plenty of cases where people are having a hard time reading through some overly complex selector.  i generally vote to simplify them and use logic elsehwere to handle those bits.
[11:23:22] <robertmaxrees> but this is freenode, so preferences are wrong to some people
[11:23:50] <doug64k> in that case, the src test will always pass anyway. just speaking totally in general :)
[11:24:08] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:24:23] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're on about, but carry on.
[11:24:27] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: img will always have a src
[11:24:32] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[11:25:29] <doug64k> Solcero: does my gist do what you wanted?
[11:26:03] <cj> hey folks
[11:26:06] <doug64k> Solcero: more efficient selector: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/01de6da1c05612a3db58
[11:26:19] <cj> there seem to be a few tools to determine whether an element is in the viewport... can someone recommend one?
[11:26:23] <Solcero> doug64k: thx a lot it works
[11:26:29] <robertmaxrees> doug64k if images always have a source, why select images with a source?
[11:26:29] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:26:50] <robertmaxrees> you could do just $('img') and get the same result.
[11:26:52] <cj> I want to load more elements when about 70% of the elements I've fetched have come in to view
[11:26:54] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: true, but I was following his spec with android precision: he said things with src tag :D
[11:26:55] <robertmaxrees> no reason to filter that differently.
[11:28:03] <decx> cj element offset relative to scroll position and windowheight, it's quite straight forward
[11:28:17] <robertmaxrees> ^ do this.
[11:28:20] <doug64k> cj: jquery waypoints
[11:28:43] <doug64k> (plugin)
[11:29:22] <robertmaxrees> if you go with what decx suggested, you should make sure to cache as many selectors up front as possible.
[11:29:57] <robertmaxrees> so you're not re-running the constructors over and over on scroll
[11:30:01] <doug64k> cj: to do it manually, listen for 'scroll' events on window, get the scroll position with $(window).scrollTop, and use element.offset() to get its page-relative position, and elem.height() to get its height, do a range compare, and you have a bool that is true if the element is visible
[11:30:11] <robertmaxrees> also consider debouncing, though that shouldn't be a big deal.
[11:30:23] <doug64k> cj: it is easy for things that aren't nested inside a scrolling container
[11:31:06] <cj> doug64k: okay, it's not nested.  Can you point me to an example?  I'm not familiar with finding scroll position.
[11:31:19] <cj> ah, $(window).scrollTop
[11:31:41] <cj> cancel that request for an example.  The instructions above are clear.
[11:37:39] <doug64k> cj: http://jstraight.com/1149/1
[11:38:30] <robertmaxrees> move var win = $(window) and elem = $('.foo') before that.
[11:38:39] <robertmaxrees> and cache $('.debug'), too.
[11:38:49] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:40:22] <cj> thanks folks
[11:41:03] <doug64k> optimized a bit and better test case http://jstraight.com/1149/2
[11:41:34] <doug64k> np
[11:42:31] <decx> i'd put win height out of scroll too
[11:42:49] <decx> have an extra resize to update it
[11:42:51] <doug64k> decx: win height can change any time. you would need to listen for 'resize' and update it then
[11:42:58] <decx> yes
[11:44:03] <doug64k> ah... need to update on every resize anyway because of reflow
[11:44:17] <doug64k> it might "push" the element offscreen
[11:44:35] <decx> yes
[11:44:44] <jeffreylevesque_> is ajax syntax different from 1.8 to 1.11, and to 2.x?
[11:45:08] <NoiseEee> no
[11:46:06] <decx> is cssText crossbrowser safe?
[11:46:32] <decx> looks like it
[11:46:49] <decx> time to get rid of all these el.style. things
[11:47:13] <doug64k> cj http://jstraight.com/1149/3
[11:47:28] <doug64k> decx: thanks decx, wouldn't have noticed that bug without you
[11:48:35] <decx> with a resize you'll definitely end up needing debounce though
[11:48:36] <doug64k> cj: that one will handle reflow properly. put it so the foo is almost off the bottom and make the viewport narrow - the reflow at the top will push the foo offscreen and it will notice
[11:49:09] <decx> some browsers are like *how about i fire resize about a billion times while you resize*
[11:49:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[11:49:44] <doug64k> should I time it? :D
[11:49:53] <robertmaxrees> debounce it, yeah.
[11:50:02] <doug64k> < 1ms probably
[11:50:21] <jeffreylevesque_> anyone care providing suggestions on my jquery implementations - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning
[11:55:29] <doug64k> jeffreylevesque: sudo git? imho you should either make a group and chgrp/chmod it or do something with the permissions first. some people might be put off by sudo git
[11:59:06] <doug64k> jeffreylevesque: why old jquery version? 1.8.3?
[11:59:32] <robertmaxrees> probably breaking API changes in 1.9
[12:02:08] <doug64k> jeffreylevesque: new FormData() is mysterious unless you specify a form
[12:03:51] <BostonGeorge2k> hi, i would like to use jqplot and tablesorter on my project but i figured out tablesorter is not working when jqplot is working
[12:04:05] <cj> decx: that's no fun.  I started with GTK+, and I think it used to do it for every pixel that was adjusted.  Now it probably detects a resize start and then waits until the resize stops before firing.  once.
[12:04:07] <BostonGeorge2k> if i remove this line, tablesorter works, http://pastebin.com/4MgC86km
[12:04:25] <BostonGeorge2k> so question is, how do i make two js scripts work together
[12:04:33] <robertmaxrees> BostonGeorge2k they just do.
[12:05:10] <BostonGeorge2k> robertmaxrees do you have used both in a project?
[12:05:29] <robertmaxrees> oh you're talking about jqplot and tablesorter, not in general
[12:05:43] <BostonGeorge2k> yes :/
[12:06:33] <BostonGeorge2k> how can i debug this?
[12:06:43] <robertmaxrees> open your console
[12:07:28] <robertmaxrees> see if there are errors.
[12:07:44] <BostonGeorge2k> there aren't
[12:08:24] <decx> well what's s1
[12:08:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd re-read documentation and make sure i'm selecting things correctly/feeding data in the right format.
[12:09:34] <BostonGeorge2k> s1 is just a var that holds the data for the plot
[12:14:06] <krambiorix> hi, this is always 0  while there are input boxes in my tr ... $(this).find('tbody').find('tr').filter($(this).find('input,select').length > 0).length  -> what am i doing wrong?
[12:14:37] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: You probably want what's in filter in a function.
[12:14:56] <BillCriswell> .filter(function(){ return $(this).find('input,select').length > 0; })...
[12:15:13] <krambiorix> oooow i forgot, thanks BillCriswell
[12:15:21] <BillCriswell> No prob bob.
[12:15:23] <definity> HOw can i make my site scroll horizontally rather than vertically?
[12:15:36] <BillCriswell> definity: scrollLeft instead of scrollTop
[12:30:00] <doug64k> BillCriswell: why not use .has for that?
[12:30:26] <BillCriswell> doug64k: Good point.
[12:34:19] <doug64k> krambiorix: bill's suggestion is fine, but this is slightly less code: $('tbody tr', this).has('input,select').length
[12:35:09] <doug64k> gives you the number of tr elements that are a descendent of tbody that have a child matching the selector 'input,select'
[12:35:17] <krambiorix> doug64k, ow i never used that
[12:35:19] <doug64k> that are a descendent of this
[12:36:11] <krambiorix> doug64k, thanks!
[12:36:20] <krambiorix> does someone know what i'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/ugxnyt09/
[12:36:57] <robertmaxrees> in that instance, ID isn't edfined.
[12:37:15] <robertmaxrees> also, don't select on data attributes if you can.
[12:37:35] <robertmaxrees> especially with $('#newcontactpopup[data-id="'+id+'"]') - you can only have one #newcontactpopup anyway
[12:38:08] <doug64k> krambiorix: you must not duplicate ids. it won't work
[12:38:18] <krambiorix> ok , i'll change that
[12:38:36] <doug64k> krambiorix: that selector isn't nonsense though - it could give you 0 elements if that element didnt have the attribute, but that is not likely what you want
[12:38:37] <P0rk_> here is a logic question that I am still having a terrible time with: I have a series of yes/no -ish questions (do you live alone or with roommates? ALONE   ROOMMATES) and if one is selected, no details needed. if the other, a list of details needs to be provided.
[12:38:43] <robertmaxrees> oh wait this is probably my FUD around attribute selectors ;)
[12:38:45] <P0rk_> what is the best way to handle this?
[12:39:14] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: lol
[12:39:38] <krambiorix> doug64k, true
[12:40:35] <robertmaxrees> P0rk_ are they checkboxes or radios?
[12:40:48] <robertmaxrees> if radios, get the value of the selected one.
[12:41:16] <robertmaxrees> if checkboxes, similar concept.
[12:41:28] <robertmaxrees> you'll probably want to build a helper function that returns the value that you want./
[12:41:42] <P0rk_> I have tried checkboxes, radios, checkboxes that act as radios, buttons that turn off/on values in text fields, anchor elements that turn on/off values in text fields. buttons that just show detail, or set a value to null...
[12:41:55] <P0rk_> I can get them all to work
[12:41:57] <robertmaxrees> the logic is pretyt basic either way
[12:42:56] <P0rk_> I started with radio inputs. but then I wanted to be able to changemy mind and deselect a radio button. so I went with checkboxes...
[12:43:27] <robertmaxrees> i would've have added a third option in those cases - "n/a" ;)
[12:43:31] <P0rk_> but then someone pointed out that I didn't need an input element, just a button that either showed the details (where my inputs were) or a button that said "no value" for the question
[12:44:51] <P0rk_> unfortunately, this is an alcoholism test that requires that n/a cannot be used. They will accept skipped questions (which I argued was NA) but they say that NA means it doesn't apply, not I'm refusing to answer. And the Im refusing to answer button won't work because they could just run out of time.
[12:45:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd mark that one as "skip" in that case, but meh.
[12:45:25] <P0rk_> psychologists are nuts
[12:45:45] <robertmaxrees> there's actually a lot of science behind the way questions/answers are worded.
[12:46:00] <robertmaxrees> "Not Applicable" and "Skip" are different concepts entirely.
[12:46:10] <P0rk_> I know. But you'd think that a professional international organization would know that.
[12:46:15] <P0rk_> they are idiots.
[12:46:29] <doug64k> lol
[12:46:30] <P0rk_> Half of the questions are logical fallacies
[12:46:42] <P0rk_> Do your parents know you are an alcoholic?
[12:46:47] <doug64k> P0rk_: I'm sure there is a method to their madness though
[12:47:02] <P0rk_> That's a loaded question, what if you aren't an alcoholic, any answer is incriminating
[12:47:19] <doug64k> alcoholism is illegal?
[12:47:42] <doug64k> nevermind
[12:48:06] <robertmaxrees> either way, I would have used radios in the markup for data's sake and to simplify logic.  to more directly answer your question, you should setup a function that reads stuff for you and returns what you need.
[12:48:07] <P0rk_> You'd think. When I pointed out the 33 errors in the most commonly used test, they asked me to rewrite the test for submission because they had never considered the logical fallacies---any of the 12 of them
[12:48:52] <doug64k> P0rk_: can you cite an example of a logical fallacy? I'm curious what you mean
[12:48:55] <robertmaxrees> does that answer your question?
[12:48:57] <P0rk_> are you suggesting a function that processes the form, or builds the form
[12:49:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd have the form there always and only make it required if they select the requsite answer.
[12:49:19] <P0rk_> https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/
[12:49:32] <robertmaxrees> *required and displayed
[12:49:45] <robertmaxrees> we have that poster hanging up in my office ;)
[12:49:53] <P0rk_> The greatest resource for bull---- logic in arguments.
[12:50:15] <doug64k> P0rk_: I know what the word means. I meant the questions. nevermind
[12:50:32] <P0rk_> I'm sorry.
[12:51:01] <doug64k> like, "do you prefer to beat your wife or your son" type of questions?
[12:51:02] <P0rk_> Does your wife, or parents complain about your drinking?
[12:51:13] <P0rk_> what about your husband?
[12:51:25] <P0rk_> What if you are there for drug addiction, not alcoholism
[12:51:27] <robertmaxrees> getting back on topic ;)
[12:51:36] <doug64k> sorry lol
[12:51:36] <P0rk_> sorry
[12:51:47] <robertmaxrees> it's not a big deal.
[12:51:52] <robertmaxrees> just wondering if the answer helped
[12:52:26] <P0rk_> So, you would have the questions and their required details as a JSON object, then build the form programmatically?
[12:52:43] <robertmaxrees> it depends on what i'm working with.
[12:53:01] <robertmaxrees> if it's all static, i'd just have the markup all built and ready to go, then setup a validator of some kind.
[12:53:09] <doug64k> P0rk_: when given a choice between hard-coding and making it data-driven, typically data-driven is the way to go, when there is more than one instance of a thing
[12:53:12] <robertmaxrees> even if i'm using JSON, i'd build everything up front.
[12:54:35] <doug64k> sorry I'm a bit of a scatterbrain today. throwing off the discussion :)
[12:54:36] <P0rk_> okay. that's the first foothold I needed. thanks. When laying this out, 1/3 of the questions are simple yes/no (if yes, details) questions. But then 2/3 are multiple choice (5 options per question)
[12:54:47] <P0rk_> Do I use tables or not? Or some tables and some not
[12:54:58] <jeffreylevesque_> doug64k, so you suggest i update my jquery version?
[12:55:15] <doug64k> jeffreylevesque: if there is no special reason to use that version, I would
[12:55:42] <doug64k> jeffreylevesque: assuming it isn't too much work to verify that it didn't break
[12:55:48] <jeffreylevesque_> all i remember is using event delegation
[12:55:56] <doug64k> jeffreylevesque: .live?
[12:55:57] <jeffreylevesque_> to dynamically create more html elements
[12:56:02] <jeffreylevesque_> nope, .on
[12:57:24] <doug64k> jeffreylevesque: ok then your code is reasonably modern jquery
[13:15:14] <nrl> Good evening! A question - is there a way to use to lower the opacity of an element by the user scrolling? So scrolling down will gradually lower the opacity and up increase it.
[13:17:05] <BillCriswell> nrl: Yeah, calculate the opacity based on the scroll top.
[13:17:49] <nrl> what if the object in question is in the footer? So the page per say isn't scrolling, I just want to detect the scrolling input.
[13:21:15] <rochadt> nrl: you can bind events to the mouse scroll but it's not consistent across browsers, i.e. DOMMouseScroll vs mousewheel
[13:22:16] <nrl> alright.. I'll look into it. Thanks!
[13:22:40] <BillCriswell> Yeah, not sure scrolls actually happen there's something to scroll (if that makes sense).
[13:24:54] <BillCriswell> Might be able to do some shananigans with opacity 0.
[13:29:20] <BillCriswell> There we go, weeee: http://jsbin.com/rocuxucepo/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:44:24] <toothe> im going through the jquery tutorial, stuck on a pretty early part.
[13:44:34] <toothe> http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/#launching-code-on-document-ready
[13:44:48] <toothe> I don't understand what $ (document ).ready(function() { } does
[13:45:16] <toothe> is that like saying that it'll run as soon as the JS is ready?
[13:45:21] <toothe> and the core HTML?
[13:45:23] <P0rk_> rochat, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/pb2yohme/ ?
[13:45:54] <P0rk_> sry, rochadt, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/pb2yohme/?
[13:46:35] <BillCriswell> toothe: It says it'll run as soon as the document is ready and can be manipulated.
[13:47:02] <toothe> how ist hat different than window.onload?
[13:48:45] <BillCriswell> toothe: onload waits for images and shit.
[13:48:54] <toothe> ahh
[13:49:02] <rochadt> P0rk: scroll will work if you have content to scroll. mousescroll and mousewheel are essentially keypress events for your mouse.  Which is what nrl was asking about: So the page per say isn't scrolling, I just want to detect the scrolling input
[13:49:09] <BillCriswell> ready jut waits for the dom to be ready to be manipulated (at least that's how I always understood it).
[13:54:59] <doug64k> toothe: there is no such thing as a 'ready' event, that is a fabrication of jquery's. there is a DOMContentLoaded event though, which corresponds to the jquery ready event. The onload event fires when everything is loaded, ready fires soon after all of the html elements exist
[13:55:18] <doug64k> ready fires sooner than load
[13:58:20] <doug64k> DOMContentLoaded doesn't fire on all browsers, so listening for jquery's ready event means "try to fire this when DOMContentLoaded if you can, otherwise, fire it as soon as you can after the html elements all exist"
[13:58:38] <robertmaxrees> also, ready sees if domcontentloaded had already run.
[13:58:43] <robertmaxrees> so you can attach later and it'll still work.
[13:58:48] <ccmonster> when an A link is clicked which causes a file download, how do I know when the event is finished?
[13:59:18] <robertmaxrees> also also, .ready() is not the same as .on('ready'), as I found out.
[14:00:45] <tkdaj> anyone know how to find the max number of <td> in any of the <tr>s in a table not counting any nested tables?
[14:01:38] <doug64k> tkdaj: $('table > tr > td').length, assuming no tbody is used
[14:02:05] <doug64k> but you would need to restrict it to a certain table right? so you would need something before 'table' in the selector
[14:02:49] <tkdaj> umm
[14:02:52] <doug64k> or replace table with something that selects that table
[14:03:00] <ccmonster> ?
[14:03:05] <tkdaj> $('#' + elem.attr('id') + '> * > tr').each(function () {
[14:03:05] <tkdaj> 				var count = $(this).find('td').length;
[14:03:06] <tkdaj> 				if (count > max) max = count;
[14:03:06] <tkdaj> 			});
[14:03:14] <tkdaj> that's what i'm using now and it counts tables and tds that are nested
[14:03:20] <robertmaxrees> tkdaj don't multiline paste please
[14:03:24] <tkdaj> sorry
[14:03:51] <robertmaxrees> $('#' + elem.attr('id') + '> * > tr') is really bizarre - specifically the first part.  you should already have the ID.
[14:04:21] <tkdaj> Well, I don't. This is an angularjs directive which you can add as an attribute to any table.
[14:04:41] <tkdaj> so, when they add it it sends the element itself to the function I am using.  I use that to get the ID
[14:04:46] <robertmaxrees> what is elem in this case?
[14:04:49] <tkdaj> the table
[14:04:56] <doug64k> tkdaj: why > * >
[14:04:57] <robertmaxrees> because you could just use $(this).find(); instead
[14:05:02] <BillCriswell> tkdaj: $(elem).find('> * > tr') could get what you're going for I Think...
[14:05:03] <tkdaj> to include tbody
[14:05:15] <tkdaj> I'll try that
[14:05:23] <tkdaj> ohh...
[14:05:46] <tkdaj> Sorry I'm kind of new to a lot of this and learning it all as I go, but when I have $(elem) that's the same as all that other junk?
[14:06:09] <robertmaxrees> that's the same as $('#' + elem.attr('id'))
[14:06:14] <tkdaj> oh, lol
[14:06:20] <robertmaxrees> also, you generally want .prop(), not .attr()
[14:06:21] <tkdaj> makes sense
[14:06:26] <tkdaj> what's the difference?
[14:06:38] <robertmaxrees> prop gets the underlying DOM value, not the value from the markup.
[14:06:45] <doug64k> tkdaj: $('#' ... looks up what you already have
[14:06:58] <tkdaj> oh, okay
[14:06:59] <robertmaxrees> not super important until you get to forms.
[14:07:02] <robertmaxrees> but still a good habit
[14:07:08] <tkdaj> sounds good to me
[14:07:51] <respek> always learning in here :)
[14:08:11] <tkdaj> hmm... well, $(elem).find('> * > tr').each(function () {... works as well, but I still get the nested tds
[14:09:12] <NoiseEee> i would rather you be explicit
[14:09:28] <tkdaj> I am trying to make this a universal directive that a user can add to any table and it will automatically paginate the table for them
[14:09:37] <tkdaj> but in order to do that, I need to know how many columns wide it is
[14:10:02] <tkdaj> which is why I don't want the nested tables/tds
[14:10:12] <tkdaj> just the original tables tds
[14:10:53] <doug64k> elem.children('thead,tbody,tfoot').children('tr')   might that work?
[14:10:55] <NoiseEee> so you should be using .children()
[14:11:02] <tkdaj> oh...
[14:11:17] <tkdaj> instead of .each()?
[14:11:22] <doug64k> yes
[14:11:40] <robertmaxrees> .find('> * > tr') that universla selector might trip stuff up, too.
[14:12:45] <tkdaj> I did $(elem).find('> * > tr').children(function () { ...
[14:12:54] <tkdaj> is that incorrect?
[14:13:04] <NoiseEee> or wouldn't something like:  var childList = {};  $('tr').each(function (i,el) { childList[i] = $(el).children('td').length})
[14:13:13] <tkdaj> It looks like it is telling me it is supposed to have a selector as a parameter
[14:13:33] <doug64k> tkdaj: "it"?
[14:13:42] <tkdaj> visual studios intellisense
[14:13:45] <NoiseEee> something like that ^^ *should* give you an object (childList) with each <tr> listed and the count of un-nested <td>s there are
[14:13:52] <NoiseEee> and then you can pluck the highest value from the object
[14:14:54] <tkdaj> okay, so if elem is the table, I would do var trs = $(elem).find('> * > tr');
[14:14:59] <tkdaj> that gives me the trs, right?
[14:15:24] <tkdaj> then trs.each() and give it the function above?
[14:15:25] <NoiseEee> $(elem).children('tr') would do it in an easier-to-read way
[14:15:46] <NoiseEee> i've personally never ever used a > or < selector in all my years
[14:15:56] <NoiseEee> it just makes the code immediately opaque
[14:16:18] <NoiseEee> but that is also because i get to control/adjust the markup as i see fit 99% of the time
[14:16:18] <cj> how do I get the third-to-last of this selection list?
[14:16:19] <cj> $('#search_container .thing')
[14:16:34] <robertmaxrees> cj you can use negative values in .eq()
[14:16:40] <robertmaxrees> .eq(-3) should work
[14:16:44] <cj> thank you, sir.
[14:16:57] <NoiseEee> but tkdaj, yes, then you could trs.each() with that function
[14:17:45] <tkdaj> let me post a plunkr with the html and the javascript.  It won't work because there is a lot more to it, but at least you can see the code.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but it keeps giving me 0 now
[14:18:31] <tkdaj> http://plnkr.co/edit/h70EojGmUw1arS3dKSCG?p=catalogue
[14:19:07] <tkdaj> if you don't know angular, you can ignore all the crap in the js file except the link: function( ......
[14:19:13] <tkdaj> that's the part I'm trying to get to work
[14:21:16] <doug64k> NoiseEee: > means "with child matching". I think you should be able to assume that the other developer knows the language
[14:22:15] <robertmaxrees> doug64k in cases like this, it can be difficult to read through.  it's also more performant to do method chaining
[14:22:35] <robertmaxrees> it can be a marginal difference, granted.
[14:22:35] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[14:22:47] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: are you sure it is more performant?
[14:22:54] <NoiseEee> doug64k: maybe its just me then, my eyes kind of gloss over immediately for some reason
[14:22:55] <Omar-> hi
[14:23:04] <robertmaxrees> doug64k check out what i just linked.
[14:23:16] <robertmaxrees> as I said, it can be a marginal difference.
[14:23:34] <tkdaj> are you talking to me?
[14:23:37] <tkdaj> oh nevermind
[14:23:45] <doug64k> NoiseEee: none of us like css (I hope) but I think > is nearly basic. I can agree that you lose your audience with ~ or :not(simpleselector)
[14:24:04] <robertmaxrees> i side with NoiseEee that > muddles things.
[14:24:17] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer using .find() and .children() instead.
[14:26:40] <tkdaj> I think I figured out why it keeps counting the nested tds...
[14:26:43] <NoiseEee> tkdaj: http://jsfiddle.net/hn0fm0zw/
[14:27:23] <NoiseEee> tkdaj: not the leanest, but hopefully you can follow whats happening.  also chrome (and others??) will automatically make a <tbody> even where none exists
[14:28:01] <tkdaj> when you do .each(function(i, el)) I'm assuming i is where it is in the foreach loop, what is el?
[14:28:05] <tkdaj> the parent element?
[14:28:11] <robertmaxrees> the current element.
[14:28:14] <robertmaxrees> same as this
[14:28:15] <tkdaj> oh, okay
[14:28:49] <tkdaj> woohoo!
[14:29:10] <NoiseEee> also http://jsfiddle.net/hn0fm0zw/1/ works a bit better in FF (seems the fake firebug lite doesnt work)
[14:29:12] <tkdaj> just changed the .find() to .children() inside the .each() and it works correctly now
[14:29:21] <NoiseEee> beauty
[14:29:22] <tkdaj> I was changing the wrong thing...
[14:29:29] <tkdaj> thanks guys :)
[14:29:58] <NoiseEee> np tkdaj
[14:31:12] <tkdaj> is there a better way to do table.insertRow() using JQuery?
[14:31:53] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery btw ;)
[14:32:09] <tkdaj> sorry
[14:32:22] <tkdaj> so, is there a way to do $(elem).insertRow
[14:32:52] <robertmaxrees> you can, but why?
[14:33:37] <tkdaj> same reason.  Now that I got that last part to work (finding how many columns there are in the table) I want to add another row at the bottom with the options for table numbers
[14:34:06] <robertmaxrees> you can just use elem instead.
[14:34:18] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'd need to $(elem)[0]
[14:34:21] <tkdaj> elem is the table, but I want to add a row to it?
[14:34:28] <tkdaj> I don't understand
[14:34:59] <NoiseEee> you can add a row wherever you like
[14:35:23] <tkdaj> that's what I was asking, though. How do I do that?
[14:35:33] <robertmaxrees> $(elem) implies you're passing something explicitly to the jquery function - elem would be the underlying dom node.
[14:35:54] <NoiseEee> first create the row itself; you can use DOM functions, or for that matter, a string like "<tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>"
[14:36:18] <NoiseEee> if at the bottom, then just $(tableReference).append(stringThatICreated)
[14:36:25] <NoiseEee> or you can find the TR you want and use either .before or .after
[14:38:46] <tkdaj> oh... okay!
[14:38:47] <tkdaj> cool
[14:39:27] <tkdaj> would this work:     $(elem).children('tr:last').after(
[14:39:51] <robertmaxrees> Did You Try?™
[14:41:32] <tkdaj> working on it
[14:42:54] <fatalhalt> i have walked dom tree a bit with parent() and next() methods, how can I chain on selector e.g. someElement.parent().parent().next().$('i know this is wrong but help') ?
[14:43:25] <robertmaxrees> .find
[14:43:30] <robertmaxrees> .next().find()
[14:43:50] <fatalhalt> robertmaxrees, thanks
[14:44:03] <robertmaxrees> assuming you want all children of that .next() call.
[14:44:12] <robertmaxrees> also, check out .closest() instead of your chained .parent() calls.
[14:45:52] <fatalhalt> robertmaxrees, thanks, got only v1.2.6 here, seems like closest() came in 1.3
[14:46:01] <robertmaxrees> woah
[14:46:05] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't update?
[14:46:49] <fatalhalt> robertmaxrees, i would if it was my website :]
[14:47:57] <robertmaxrees> ouch
[15:01:14] <giuseppesolinas> hello
[15:01:37] <giuseppesolinas> is there a way to select a plain text string from the document?
[15:02:26] <giuseppesolinas> so that I can do "hello".css('color', 'red') ?
[16:06:00] <digital-ghost> ID Selector question -- how do I make this syntax correct? var $row = $('#some_status_' + status_id, '#some_status_' + status_id);
[16:06:24] <digital-ghost> The 2nd ID is actually different.. goofed on that.
[16:07:03] <digital-ghost> But I cannot seem to get two dynamically added values to work like $('#status1, #status2');
[16:15:50] <Robdgreat> digital-ghost: you're not building one selector, but trying to pass two string arguments to the function
[16:16:21] <Robdgreat> you want '#some_status_' + status_id + ', #some_status' + other_status_id
[16:16:32] <Robdgreat> you want '#some_status_' + status_id + ', #some_status_' + other_status_id
[16:16:33] <Robdgreat> rather
[16:16:54] <robertmaxrees> $row = $('#some_status_' + status_id, ', #some_status_' + status_id);
[16:16:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:18:30] <digital-ghost> Oooh.
[16:18:42] <digital-ghost> I see what I was doing wrong now, thanks guys.
[16:18:50] <digital-ghost> I couldn't wrap my head around that.
[16:43:37] <P0rk_> if I make an activateField method that returns a deferred, I can use something like activateField(fld).then(showDetails) and show Details will fire when the deferred is resolved, right?
[16:46:35] <robertmaxrees> .then() is whenever it's resolve, rejected, or still in progress.
[16:47:01] <robertmaxrees> .then was removed in 1.8
[16:47:21] <robertmaxrees> well, 2 versions of it, rather.
[16:47:27] <P0rk_> wow...cool
[16:47:41] <robertmaxrees> you could alternatively, just use .done()
[16:48:20] <robertmaxrees> long day
[16:48:38] <P0rk_> You've been a great help. Thanks a lot
[16:48:57] <robertmaxrees> deffo
[16:49:07] <robertmaxrees> the method signatures should all be in the api docs btw.
[16:56:09] <bracky> is there a way to generate a timestamp like PHP's `strtotime` in jQuery?
[16:56:21] <bracky> example: strtotime("+2 weeks");
[16:56:30] <bracky> googled, but couldn't find anything.
[16:59:50] <Robdgreat> this took me about 5 seconds to find https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse
[16:59:53] <Robdgreat> heh
[17:01:14] <robertmaxrees> barely waited more than a minute.
[17:23:40] <digital-ghost> Is there any situation where a function has 4 parameters, but still executes when only 2 are passed?
[17:23:51] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[17:24:00] <robertmaxrees> you can specify optional parameters.
[17:24:12] <digital-ghost> What would an optional param look like?
[17:24:19] <robertmaxrees> from which side?
[17:24:21] <robertmaxrees> writing or using?
[17:24:33] <digital-ghost> If I were writing the function that has them.
[17:25:02] <robertmaxrees> http://www.markhansen.co.nz/javascript-optional-parameters/
[17:25:05] <robertmaxrees> tons of says.
[17:25:41] <robertmaxrees> *Ways
[17:26:01] <digital-ghost> I'm trying to read some code where I see, var function jump(param1, param2, param3, param4) { // does stuff } but when it's called, all I am seeing is jump(thing1, thing2)
[17:26:12] <digital-ghost> Really confusing, I thought it would bomb in this case.
[17:26:16] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:26:29] <robertmaxrees> you can check those parameters inside the function body and see if they're defined or not.
[17:26:53] <digital-ghost> Ah yeah that seems to be going on here
[17:27:06] <digital-ghost> they're being set to something
[17:27:19] <digital-ghost> Most of my knowledge is in Ruby, so jumping into javascript/jQuery is a weird place to be.
[17:27:53] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.  class based to prototypal plus some of the more unusual syntax concepts.
[17:31:24] <BostonGeorge2k> hm is there any way to emulate the iOS 8 browser on chrome's dev tools?
[17:32:00] <BostonGeorge2k> well of course not, forget about it^^
[17:32:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:32:22] <robertmaxrees> which part of emulating?
[17:33:25] <BostonGeorge2k> i am hearing that a webpage is not being displayed properly on ipad, ios8
[17:33:36] <robertmaxrees> you can go into device emulation mode
[17:33:40] <BostonGeorge2k> and i am thinking about a way to debug it since i dont have an ipad^
[17:34:28] <BostonGeorge2k> yes but isnt the device emulating mode just changes clientHeight and clientWidth
[17:34:37] <BostonGeorge2k> *changing
[17:35:09] <robertmaxrees> there's an iOS simular iirc.
[17:35:38] <robertmaxrees> you could use that to run safari and test.
[17:36:04] <BostonGeorge2k> inside dev tools?
[17:36:09] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:36:12] <robertmaxrees> the IOS simulator
[17:36:12] <BostonGeorge2k> oh ok
[17:42:26] <digital-ghost> robertmaxrees: Thanks again
[17:42:36] <digital-ghost> Going to be reading this article on the bus home heheh
[17:42:40] <digital-ghost> night!
[18:30:21] <tharkun> The font on the combobox of this page http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox Which one is it? How can I manipulate the size of it and where can I download it?
[18:31:12] <tharkun> If anyone knows.
[18:33:22] <Robdgreat> tharkun: appears to be verdana
[18:33:26] <Robdgreat> it ships with windows
[18:36:50] <tharkun> Robdgreat: depressing. No windows available around. Guess I'll have to look for something similar around. Thanks anyway.

[19:59:25] <sadtaco> Whao. I just stumbled on a really clean, css and html wise, to make those horizontal scrolling pages.
[20:00:27] <sadtaco> Make each page display:inline-block; vertical-align:top; white-space:normal; width:100%; height:100%;  On their container put white-space:no-wrap.  Then you just need to negative margin-left the first page.  Don't need a wide container around the "pages".
[22:12:02] <sgsvenkatesh> Hello
[22:12:20] <sgsvenkatesh> Is anyone free here to help ?
[22:12:31] <Jamesonwa> what's up
[22:12:41] <Jamesonwa> ask away
[22:12:45] <sgsvenkatesh> How do I exclude apostrophe from val(name) function ?
[22:13:36] <Jamesonwa> explain more in detail
[22:14:45] <sgsvenkatesh> I have validated firstName using $('#className').val(firstName)
[22:15:01] <sgsvenkatesh> But now it is not accepting names with apostrophes
[22:15:13] <sgsvenkatesh> Names like O'Brian
[22:15:19] <sgsvenkatesh> O'Rielly
[22:16:06] <Uhkis> what are you using to validate those?
[22:47:45] <sgsvenkatesh> @Uhkis and @Jamesonwa Thanks
[22:47:52] <sgsvenkatesh> Found the problem
[22:48:14] <sgsvenkatesh> It was defined somewhere else.

[23:53:43] <juslintek>                     $('#ratiobyfact-' + data.tnum).text(data.postRatioByFact);
[23:53:43] <juslintek>                 }
[23:54:29] <juslintek> I'm checking if it is defined or exists, if it doesn't that I don't want it.
[23:55:14] <Cork> juslintek: 'postRatioByFact' in data
[23:55:21] <juslintek> yes
[23:55:31] <Cork> juslintek: you currently check if undefined exist in data
[23:56:19] <Cork> or actually you check if an undeclared variables content exist as a key in data
[23:57:22] <rajlaksh> hi
[23:57:43] <juslintek> Well I want to check if it exists as property. if it does show it, if it doesn't skip it.
[23:57:56] <juslintek> Do I have to do like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27509/detecting-an-undefined-object-property
