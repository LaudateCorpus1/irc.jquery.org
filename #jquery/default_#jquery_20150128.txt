[00:03:29] <kevireilly_> Cork: without the domains matching or a * being provided, the browser will throw a cross origin error afaik
[00:03:57] <kevireilly_> as in http://localhost can’t make a request against http://bla.com unless it allows localhost (not sure this is possible) or * for any source origin
[00:04:14] <kevireilly_> AJAX request to be more specific
[00:04:59] <Cork> kevireilly_: he uses the origin from the request
[00:05:04] <Cork> it is guaranteed to match
[00:05:12] <Cork> 100%
[00:06:13] <kevireilly_> fair enough, guess it circles back to to whether or not that applies to cookies
[00:06:40] <kevireilly_> in the context of that, I was suggesting * as a quick test to see if that applies in this scenario
[00:06:41] <Cork> origin has no effect on cookies
[00:07:04] <Cork> cookie permissions is a user privacy/security detail
[00:07:10] <Cork> not something to protect the server
[00:07:19] <Cork> (if the cookie is set or not i mean)
[00:07:19] <kevireilly_> oh, i was referring to how you said how cors affect how the browser looks at set-cookie
[00:07:31] <Cork> yes, and that isn't related to headers
[00:07:57] <Cork> it's limited by the origin references the browser keep for each request
[00:08:03] <Cork> and can't be overrided by the server
[00:08:14] <Cork> cause, like i said, it is to protect the user, not the server
[00:08:37] <kevireilly_> understood, sorry for the misunderstanding
[00:11:04] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[00:12:33] <memeht>  Can someone help me understand "foo .then().timeout() " ?
[00:13:41] <Cork> timeout?
[00:14:10] <Cork> memeht: is this added by a plugin or something?
[00:14:31] <Cork> cause as far as i know, that isn't a jquery deferred method
[00:15:20] <memeht> Cork: That's what's got me confused, its attached to a Promise() handler, but I can't find any documentation for what timeout does
[00:15:32] <memeht> I can post a code snippet if that might shed more light
[00:15:33] <lintguy1> Cork: Hello!
[00:16:06] <Cork> memeht: you would have to look at the lib implementing Promise
[00:16:18] <Cork> cause 1. it isn't part of the native promise object
[00:16:28] <Cork> and 2. Promise isn't part of jquery
[00:16:28] <lintguy1> How do i bind to an element that doesn't exist yet, in jquery 1.2.6?
[00:16:39] <Cork> ugg 1.2...
[00:16:58] <lintguy1> yeah, the company refuse to upgrade, afraid things will break
[00:17:20] <lintguy1> so i'm just helping them plaster over some wounds
[00:17:22] <Cork> lintguy1: $(document).bind('event', function(event) { if($(event.target).is('#selector')) {} }); might work
[00:17:36] <Cork> though i haven't touched 1.2 in soo long i'm not sure .is existed back then
[00:18:11] <lintguy1> Cork: it has been around since 1.0 so should work
[00:18:15] <lintguy1> Cork: thanks!!
[00:18:36] <Cork> that is basically what delegate does btw ^
[00:18:57] <lintguy1> Cork: Yeah, i looked at the source for the added functions, but i'm too JS noob
[00:19:14] <Cork> hmm
[00:19:19] <Cork> lintguy1: give me a minute
[00:19:24] <Cork> i THINK i did something wrong there
[00:19:33] <lintguy1> Hm, ok
[00:20:36] <kevireilly_> haha first thought was .live but apparentely only available since 1.3
[00:21:46] <Cork> lintguy1: yup my suspicion was right http://jsfiddle.net/uqxpafdo/
[00:21:55] <Cork> you want .closest().length > 0
[00:22:05] <Cork> else you won't get the correct bubbling effect
[00:23:01] <lintguy1> that's right
[00:23:22] <lintguy1> man, it would have taken me quite a while to figure that out
[00:23:28] <lintguy1> thanks a million as usual
[00:23:31] <Cork> np
[00:23:42] <memeht> Cork: alright, thanks
[00:24:33] <Anteac> how do i get a jquery email form post to a DB or TXT or even a newsletter thing?
[00:25:56] <Cork> Anteac: uh, you post to a server and the server puts it where it should go
[00:26:14] <Anteac> sounds ez
[00:27:18] <Anteac> mind checking my site
[00:27:56] <Anteac> mauritsklaare.nl
[00:30:58] <Shai-Tan> well, that was a pointless expedition into angular :(
[00:48:34] <lintguy1> Cork: The event is of course in an iframe that doesn't exist at first. I tried but couldn't get it to bubble...
[00:49:16] <Cork> lintguy1: events never bubble cross documents
[00:49:21] <Cork> so ya, you can't do this
[00:49:30] <lintguy1> crap :-(
[00:49:36] <Cork> you have to attach the event listeners INSIDE the new document when the page has loaded in it
[00:49:53] <Cork> also this is only possible if the page inside the iframe is from the same domain
[00:51:46] <lintguy1> yeah, i'll have to write it in vanilla js
[00:52:01] <Cork> vanilla js doesn't make a difference
[00:52:08] <Cork> same restrictions apply there
[00:52:18] <lintguy1> it does for me, don't know it very well
[00:52:31] <lintguy1> learning jquery before js have just confused me
[00:52:52] <lintguy1> i'll resolve it somehow, thanks for all the help
[00:52:56] <Cork> i meant i don't see anything here dictating vanilla js
[00:53:09] <Cork> it won't change the limitations you have infront of you
[00:53:20] <lintguy1> i can put code into the iframe but there is no jquery there
[00:53:34] <Cork> is the page same domain?
[00:53:36] <lintguy1> yes
[00:53:46] <Cork> you could use window.parent.$
[00:53:55] <lintguy1> Hmm
[00:54:13] <Cork> or just bind the load event on the iframe
[00:54:45] <lintguy1> Ok, i'll try those
[01:26:39] <curiousmansi> hi i am looking for the learningjquery page for autocomplete like http://www.learningjquery.com/2010/06/a-jquery-ui-combobox-under-the-hood
[01:26:51] <curiousmansi> where they are actually using the autocomplete.
[01:27:03] <curiousmansi> i want to understand what happens in autocomplete
[01:27:07] <Cork> curiousmansi: have a look at the jqueryui demo page
[01:27:18] <curiousmansi> but there is no source code
[01:27:25] <curiousmansi> i want  to c the logic
[01:27:27] <Cork> ah
[01:27:48] <Cork> i don't think you will find a page like that for each part of jquery/jquery-ui
[01:27:57] <Cork> best is to just read the source code
[01:28:09] <Cork> it is normally well commented and should be easy enough to understand
[01:28:23] <Cork> (and you can always ask here if there is something you don't understand)
[01:30:03] <curiousmansi> Is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/autocomplete.js the file
[01:30:04] <curiousmansi> ?
[01:31:52] <Cork> yup
[01:32:24] <Cork> curiousmansi: if you haven't already you might want to dig into widgetfactory before starting with jquery-ui
[01:32:39] <Cork> as much of the logic is handled by that framework
[01:33:05] <Cork> ($.widget == widgetfactory)
[01:34:49] <curiousmansi> my question is how autocomplete works,  how it lists the suggested words. Some regex search it might be doing ,
[01:35:11] <curiousmansi> This logic will be  there in autocomplte.js right
[01:35:16] <curiousmansi> not in widgetfactory
[01:37:44] <Cork> ya
[01:37:45] <TomyWork> hi
[01:38:43] <TomyWork> how do i defer execution of a function until the current event handlers have finished?
[01:39:29] <Cork> you don't
[01:40:06] <Cork> TomyWork: if you want a more constructive comment, provide the context of what you're trying to do
[01:40:37] <TomyWork> i'm poking around in jira with tampermonkey in order to add a button to it
[01:41:01] <TomyWork> jira reconstructs the part of the page i am adding the button to when fields are edited
[01:41:20] <TomyWork> so i was going to add an on-remove hook that re-adds the button
[01:41:41] <Cork> ah...
[01:41:47] <TomyWork> as soon as jira is done rebuilding that part of the interface
[01:42:27] <Cork> well as you're writing a user script
[01:42:42] <Cork> so you have a bit of a more leeway in what you can use
[01:43:07] <Cork> construct a mutationobserver and append the buttons when the content is replaced
[01:43:15] <TomyWork> jira comes with jquery, so i figure i'd use that :)
[01:43:16] <Cork> ?mdn mutationobserver
[01:43:18] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[01:43:45] <Cork> TomyWork: if you want to do it without the observer you would have to find a callback from the code that replaces the content
[01:44:00] <Cork> as there is no other way to get to it
[01:44:04] <Cork> hmm
[01:44:06] <TomyWork> so there's not something like a timer?
[01:44:06] <Cork> actually
[01:44:18] <TomyWork> doesnt matter if the button only appears a second later or something
[01:44:29] <Cork> is it replacing the input fields too on edit?
[01:44:45] <Cork> if it doesn't you could just bind a new event listener to the same field
[01:44:55] <TomyWork> it seems to replace everything
[01:45:02] <TomyWork> except body, i guess :)
[01:45:06] <Cork> ya, then observer is your only real option
[01:46:14] <Cork> TomyWork: you can use a setTimeout(function() {}) call to wait for the next event loop
[01:46:34] <Cork> but that only works if all the event handlers make there changes synchronously
[01:55:06] <TomyWork> that particular one apparently does. it worked :)
[01:55:11] <TomyWork> thanks Cork
[01:55:31] <Cork> i would still recommend using mutation observer though
[01:57:49] <Snoopal> hey guys. i got a polygone in a svg with id="blockA". i try to get the right selector but i can´t :(
[01:58:07] <Snoopal> $('#blockA').mouseover(function() { console.log(123); }) does not fire
[01:58:10] <Cork> Snoopal: svg is a diffferent document
[01:58:18] <Cork> you can to cross the document boundery
[01:58:24] <imolorhe> Hi..
[01:58:41] <Snoopal> hmmm
[01:58:53] <Snoopal> so i need to implement jquery into the svg and add code there?
[01:59:02] <Snoopal> or is this impossibro?
[01:59:35] <imolorhe> I am trying to use qunit's assert equal and one of my tests is failing. Expected to see the Result and expected values in the log but it is only showing me the expected value. Any ideas what could be wrong?
[01:59:45] <Cork> Snoopal: is the svg inline or how do you "load" it?
[02:00:55] <arup_r> What's the good Javascript book for beginner and Jquery too ?
[02:01:40] <Snoopal> hmm i just realized that it is loaded by another javascript into the document as inline element
[02:02:09] <Cork> Snoopal: then you can try something like $('svg').contents().find('#blockA')
[02:02:37] <Cork> you prob want to replace the first selector with one unique for the svg element
[02:02:41] <imolorhe> Hello? Any help?
[02:04:49] <Snoopal> 	var ele = $('svg').contents().find('#blockA');		 console.log(ele) returns length = 0 so it does not find it or would it not find it on -1 ?
[02:05:08] <Cork> no length is the number of elements in the array
[02:05:25] <Cork> and $('svg').length > 0?
[02:05:43] <Cork> Snoopal: note it is only inline if it is wrapped in a <svg> tag
[02:05:58] <Cork> if it is loaded with an <img> or <object> its external
[02:06:01] <Snoopal> $('svg').length = 1
[02:06:02] <Cork> and out of you're reach
[02:06:15] <Cork> then .find should work
[02:06:16] <Cork> hmm
[02:06:25] <Snoopal> http://www.campusball.at/ball/campus-plan/
[02:06:42] <Snoopal> the shape with A has the ID "blockA"
[02:08:14] <Cork> Snoopal: jQuery('svg').contents().find('#blockA').prop('points') works fine here
[02:09:27] <Snoopal> the script is in custommap.js
[02:09:41] <Snoopal> hmm maybe iam firing at the wrong moment
[02:09:42] <Snoopal> hmm
[02:19:16] <Mark_2> does anybody know how to emulate this function that automatically scrolls through to certain point when i click the button? http://themeforest.unitedthemes.com/wpversions/brooklyn/demo9/
[02:23:19] <soee> hi, how can i prevent animation of elment on mobiel devices/small screens ?
[02:29:46] <Cork> soee: if you use css3 animations you could just use @media queries to handle that
[02:29:57] <Cork> if you use $.animate you would have to check it manually
[02:30:17] <Tennis> Hi is it possible to print the array that is formed here? http://jsfiddle.net/4z420cjc/
[02:30:47] <soee> Cork: ok, thank you
[02:31:02] <Cork> Tennis: uh, why don't you just use .serialize()?
[02:31:07] <Tennis> also good monring o/
[02:31:21] <Tennis> I inherited this from someones who's been working on it for ages
[02:31:27] <Tennis> its a sea of css and javascript
[02:32:15] <Tennis> I'm in  a bit deep , but if I can grab the variabales and or arrays I won't have to redo the form with methods i'm more familiar in
[02:32:23] <Cork> Tennis: well if you want to output the array fromToArray just console.log() it
[02:33:30] <Tennis> so if i add console.log() to the function I will see it in the console?
[02:35:13] <curiousmansi> i have trouble understanding source of autocomplete
[02:38:39] <curiousmansi> if i go to http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-response
[02:38:48] <curiousmansi> and Multiple types supported
[02:39:23] <curiousmansi>  i am not able to understand the description given there for string
[02:45:27] <john-dev> hello. i have problems with special chars in filenames when uploading files using xhr requests. i set the content-type to utf8 using „ xhr.overrideMimeType( 'text/html; charset=UTF-8' ); „ but the charset is still wrong
[02:45:52] <john-dev> especially german umlaute
[02:49:10] <curiousmansi> _initSource in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/autocomplete.js
[02:49:37] <curiousmansi> only tell about array and string, what about the function
[03:34:41] <cannap> hi i have this         var currentUrl = $(".section[data-url-hash='" + currentHash +"']");
[03:34:51] <cannap> this works but now i need to get another value from the currentUrl div
[03:34:58] <cannap> data-index='2'
[03:35:08] <cannap> but i dont know how i get the data-index from currentUrl div
[03:35:41] <arthurvr> Hey all!
[03:36:03] <cannap> this is waht i currently get http://cl.ly/image/1J200L1A062Z
[03:36:31] <arthurvr> Hi Cannap! It would be handy if you have a reduced testcase
[03:36:45] <arthurvr> just so we can show off and everything is clear
[03:36:53] <arthurvr> jsfiddle, or a jsbin
[03:40:12] <cannap> yep working mom
[03:43:30] <cannap> here
[03:43:31] <cannap> http://jsfiddle.net/wectvqad/4/
[03:44:00] <cannap> i need the data-test2 from the div i found with data-test
[03:46:12] <xelim> cannap: div.data('test2'); or div.attr('data-test2');
[03:46:31] <xelim> cannap: does that work?
[03:47:58] <cannap> nope http://jsfiddle.net/wectvqad/5/
[03:48:55] <xelim> cannap: http://jsfiddle.net/wectvqad/6/ this works
[03:49:42] <cannap> ah OMG
[03:49:42] <xelim> cannap: you forgot the `'` for your data method
[03:49:43] <cannap> thx
[03:49:54] <xelim> cannap: np
[03:53:20] <cannap> works fine :D
[04:06:18] <norc> Hi, Id like some opinions. Is this some valid use case of .data() ? http://jsfiddle.net/n7w44djp/1/
[04:07:33] <arthurvr> norc: what do you mean with a ”valid use case”?
[04:07:43] <norc> Ok let me describe the problem first :P
[04:07:50] <Cork> norc: $('div#container').data()["proxy"] is wrong
[04:07:54] <Cork> but other then that; sure
[04:08:04] <Cork> $('#container').data("proxy")
[04:08:13] <arthurvr> yup ^
[04:08:22] <arthurvr> but I’m wondering what the real problem is
[04:08:23] <Cork> norc: also never prefix an id with a tag name
[04:08:41] <norc> Cork: Just a habit I started to make sure I dont forget it when I use classes
[04:08:43] <Cork> arthurvr: its prob just a "am i doing something bad"
[04:08:52] <norc> Cork: Is that actually a bad thing per se?
[04:08:56] <Cork> norc: yes
[04:09:03] <norc> How so?
[04:09:04] <arthurvr> yes it is :-)
[04:09:15] <arthurvr> or let me reword… there are better solutions :)
[04:09:20] <Cork> $('tag#id') => find all elements matching $('tag') THEN filter that list to the id matching #id
[04:09:32] <Cork> instead of grabbing the element from the browsers id hash table
[04:09:49] <arthurvr> doesn’t make sense in this case, only one element has the same id
[04:09:56] <arthurvr> but that’s not what we’re discussing
[04:09:59] <arthurvr> let’s stay focused
[04:10:01] <norc> As for the problem. I have a SOAP middleware, which I instantiate several times (once for each row in a specific table). Each row has buttons, and on the onclick events it needs to access the appropriate soap handler that is specific to that row. That jsfiddle is a simple case of what I would do to accomplish that.
[04:10:31] <norc> Cork: That makes sense actually.
[04:10:37] <arthurvr> than I would say it’s a solution but probably not that best way of handling it
[04:10:37] <Cork> norc: this is completely valid http://jsfiddle.net/n7w44djp/2/
[04:10:41] <Cork> and actually commonly used
[04:10:52] <Cork> jquery-ui for example does it all over the place
[04:11:28] <norc> Cork: Oh that is quite nice then. :)
[04:11:37] <norc> Was not so far off then.
[04:11:44] <arthurvr> :)
[04:12:06] <Cork> $('#input').autocomplete().data('_render', function() {}) for example
[04:12:56] <norc> Cork: Just out of curiosity. Does .data() remove these references on unload events?
[04:13:07] <Cork> norc: the data is in memory
[04:13:18] <Cork> so when the page uloads all data is lost anyway
[04:13:33] <Cork> if you mean if the element is removed, yes the element is used as a reference
[04:14:01] <norc> Cork: So the reference is lost automatically and the object does not leak?
[04:15:12] <arthurvr> It’s lost on every page load
[04:15:30] <Cork> norc: as far as i've been able to tell jquery cleans it up ya
[04:15:40] <Cork> i've not been able to find the code that does it though
[04:16:19] <arthurvr> it’s just a native behaviour
[04:16:33] <norc> arthurvr: Well Im not 100% sure what happens under the hood of my application, but I know that it doesnt trigger a full load, but rather loads contents into divs via ajax.
[04:16:36] <Cork> arthurvr: i think he meant when the element is replaced
[04:16:46] <Cork> not full pace unload
[04:16:52] <Cork> as nothing lives past that
[04:16:55] <norc> Yep.
[04:17:09] <arthurvr> oh that way - well still when the element gets (re)created all data-* gets cleaned out
[04:17:24] <Cork> arthurvr: .data isn't the attributes
[04:17:24] <norc> Ah beautiful.
[04:17:26] <norc> God I love this channel.
[04:17:32] <Cork> its actually a {} inside jquery
[04:17:36] <norc> And the library.
[04:17:44] <arthurvr> ya - miswording stuff :(
[04:17:52] <arthurvr> I mean all data connected to that element
[04:17:53] <norc> Im sorry, Im fairly new to JavaScript and jquery.
[04:18:04] <norc> So maybe I phrased the question badly :P
[04:18:18] <arthurvr> You’re welcome norc
[05:43:57] <Lone_Rifle> a Chrome extension I'm writing for injects a custom javascript that manipulates a given webpage of a website. This page invokes its own script, which amongst other things, calls $(function(e){ foo = function(e){ /*something*/} });
[05:45:23] <arthurvr> Lone_Rifle: sounds nice. Is something going wrong?
[05:45:29] <Cork> :D
[05:45:43] <Lone_Rifle> sorry, long question, might take a while
[05:46:03] <Cork> then you most likely want to split it up
[05:46:18] <Cork> gigantic text blobs isn't fun on irc
[05:46:22] <arthurvr> and build out a reduced testcase :)
[05:46:27] <Lone_Rifle> neither are multilines =)
[05:46:27] <Cork> true
[05:46:50] <Lone_Rifle> fine, a bit hard to build out the testcase since it's late over here, but I can get round to it
[05:46:55] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: if the question is if you can get access to the "foo" function
[05:47:05] <Lone_Rifle> indeed it is
[05:47:17] <Cork> then the answer is: depends on how fatefully you recreated the code
[05:47:29] <Cork> foo = function() {}; is possible and easy
[05:47:34] <Cork> var foo = function() {}; isn't
[05:47:40] <Lone_Rifle> okay, it's the former
[05:47:52] <Cork> ok then its a global function
[05:47:54] <Lone_Rifle> i'm basically trying to get it replaced with my own foo which wraps the original foo
[05:47:56] <Cork> and you can just access it
[05:48:11] <Cork> window.foo = function() {}
[05:48:41] <Cork> foo = something; is a legacy (buggy) short for window.foo = something;
[05:49:06] <arthurvr> it isn’t buggy - it’s just expected behaviour
[05:49:12] <Cork> no it isn't
[05:49:15] <Cork> its legacy
[05:49:28] <Cork> if you use strict (modern js) you will get an error
[05:49:37] <Lone_Rifle> either way, it's interesting. I've put a breakpoint in my script but when the debugger pauses there window.foo is undefined
[05:49:39] <arthurvr> true. legacy isn’t the same as buggy :-D
[05:49:46] <Cork> it is buggy
[05:50:01] <Cork> cause you can accidentally create a global variable
[05:50:06] <Cork> and the unexpected behavior
[05:50:13] <arthurvr> It can cause bugs (in strict mode), but the feature itself isn’t buggy
[05:50:15] <Cork> this is why they have removed it
[05:50:26] <Cork> arthurvr: no
[05:50:32] <Cork> they removed it cause it causes bugs
[05:50:47] <Lone_Rifle> i vaguely remember Chrome stating that extension scripts are executed in their own context, but i'm not sure if this is what's causing the lack of visibility
[05:50:50] <Cork> its one of the most common sources of bugs in js actually
[05:51:16] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: you have to inject a script into the page from your script to modify variables in the page
[05:51:33] <arthurvr> that’s true - but that doesn’t mean a js implementation is buggy. Think we’re just talking about other things. You talk about it causing bugs, while I though you meant the js implementation is buggy
[05:51:34] <Cork> window in a userscript isn't the same as window in the page
[05:51:51] <Lone_Rifle> ah, so variable scope for globals is limited to the page?
[05:52:06] <Cork> arthurvr: ok, lets rephrase it, it has widely been considered a mistake, even by the designer of the language
[05:52:16] <arthurvr> that’s true.
[05:52:18] <Cork> so they removed it from newer versions
[05:52:27] <arthurvr> But mistake != buggy
[05:52:32] <arthurvr> but let’s get to the point again
[05:52:51] <Cork> arthurvr: buggy isn't just code that crashes
[05:53:05] <Cork> code patterns that if you use is most of a time a bug
[05:53:08] <Cork> then it is buggy
[05:53:17] <Lone_Rifle> if this is one of those bug v feature discussions again...
[05:53:24] <arthurvr> I think about it as it’s specced, so it isn’t a bug
[05:53:35] <arthurvr> but let’s not discuss that, and get to the point :)
[05:53:37] <Lone_Rifle> a design flaw, then.
[05:53:46] <arthurvr> I would agree with ^
[05:53:58] <Cork> and a design flaw is a bug in the spec/design
[05:54:06] <Cork> circular reference :)
[05:54:32] <arthurvr> it’s isn’t always, but let’s get back to the point
[05:54:56] <Cork> we've already completed the "point"
[05:55:00] <Cork> that is why i moved on
[05:55:01] <Lone_Rifle> ok, so what you're proposing is that i inject the script into the document and somehow get it invoked?
[05:55:20] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: not "somehow" scripts is executed when they are injected
[05:55:23] <Cork> by design
[05:55:44] <Cork> so you just inject a script tag with the content of the script you want in the page
[05:55:57] <Cork> its quit important that it is done this way
[05:56:19] <Cork> cause if you could define the function in priviliged code and have it accessible from content
[05:56:25] <Lone_Rifle> does that assume that the browser has yet to parse the contents of the page though?
[05:56:33] <Cork> content could through how js works get access to variables in priviliged code
[05:56:41] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: no
[05:56:53] <Lone_Rifle> ok, will tias
[05:57:01] <Cork> when you attach a script element to the page the content is handed to the js engine
[05:57:31] <Cork> (unless type is NOT missing or text/javascript)
[05:57:37] <Cork> uh
[05:57:44] <Cork> *unless type is NOT missing or not text/javascript
[05:58:15] <Lone_Rifle> that also means.... that a perp could convince a victim to install a rogue extension which could inject a script into a page to grab whatever it wants from there
[05:58:26] <Cork> sure
[05:58:36] <Lone_Rifle> interesting..
[05:58:39] <Cork> nothing strange with that
[05:58:51] <Lone_Rifle> no, just coming to terms with the mechanics
[05:58:52] <Cork> extensions is privileged code
[05:59:13] <Cork> though extensions is much more limited in chrome then firefox, but the same rule still applies
[05:59:44] <Cork> in firefox extensions basically has the same capabilities as any installed "native" apps on the system
[06:00:15] <Cork> in chrome it is limited to only a few apis inside the browser
[06:00:16] <Lone_Rifle> so ie, they run as the userid of the FF process
[06:00:22] <Cork> but it can still do ex. cross domain calls
[06:00:31] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: yes
[06:00:51] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: something like readin /etc/password :)
[06:01:01] <Lone_Rifle> yea, i was worried about that
[06:01:29] <Cork> or more common doing dns highjacking
[06:01:55] <Lone_Rifle> really.
[06:01:57] <Cork> there is quite a few known malicious extensions doing that
[06:02:21] <Lone_Rifle> when i read that Programming Sucks blog post i laughed when he said the Internet is its own special hellscape
[06:02:29] <Lone_Rifle> thought he was exaggerating.
[06:02:46] <Cork> hellscape?
[06:03:09] <Cork> that you should be careful about installing things on the system includeds extensions
[06:03:12] <Cork> isn't strange to me
[06:03:39] <Cork> if a webpage on it's own could do something like this, we are in a completely different ballpark
[06:03:45] <Lone_Rifle> well yes, but your microwave doesn't irradiate you out of sheer whim
[06:04:12] <Lone_Rifle> neither does a bridge decide to buckle because .... i think you get what i mean
[06:04:22] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: you normally don't execute random unknown code in the microwave firmware
[06:04:43] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: not really, actually
[06:05:01] <Lone_Rifle> have you read the post before?
[06:05:13] <Cork> if you don't make sure the "code/program/similar" you execute is from some you can trust
[06:05:40] <Lone_Rifle> indeed, see, there's a trust problem.
[06:05:43] <Cork> it would be like getting a free microwave from a back ally, (noname) and then getting irritated when it does something dangerous
[06:06:00] <Lone_Rifle> i suppose so..
[06:06:25] <Lone_Rifle> http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks if you're so inclined
[06:06:28] <Cork> handle unknown code, as unknown/unsafe code
[06:06:35] <Cork> and you are normally safe
[06:07:04] <Cork> sure bugs will always happen, but ya, that is just how it is
[06:09:44] <Lone_Rifle> Cork: thanks for the hints
[06:27:16] <VDen> Hi, I've a question. I use jQuery to create an animation with div having background pictures. I display the page $(window).load but the images start downloading after this event causing my images to load during the animation. Is there a way to display the page when div with background are fully loaded?
[06:28:00] <arthurvr> you should make sure to not start loading the images in $(window).load
[06:28:36] <arthurvr> starting to load in the images once the rest of the page is already loaded is a bad idea
[06:29:10] <VDen> arthurvr: How do I do that? :)
[06:29:42] <arthurvr> how are you currently handling it?
[06:29:47] <arthurvr> jsfiddle/bin might be welcome
[06:31:49] <Mark_2> does anybody know what kind of parallax js plugin this site uses? http://bdmp-006.cafe24.com/bizdemo16881/main/main.php
[06:32:03] <Mark_2> and where can i get the smooth scroll to top js plugin anybody?
[06:32:56] <BillCriswell> Mark_2: I don't even know how to work this thing.
[06:33:19] <Mark_2> how do you mean?
[06:33:35] <hrust> how do i add data-* attribute to each row(tr) when initializing datatable table?
[06:33:59] <hrust> e.g. data-id
[06:34:39] <BillCriswell> hrust: You can o it pretty easily before you initialize datatables.
[06:35:19] <BillCriswell> Mark_2: Meaning I can't tell what's going on with that slideshow.
[06:35:32] <Mark_2> hmm me either
[06:36:02] <Mark_2> what about this one? anybody know what kind of parallax js this site uses? http://www.pixedelic.com/themes/geode/
[06:36:12] <BillCriswell> lol
[06:36:19] <arthurvr> Mark_2: the smooth scrolling on this site is scrollnav I believe
[06:36:26] <arthurvr> Mark_2: is that what you meant?
[06:36:40] <Mark_2> nope. scrollnav is for effects.
[06:36:50] <Mark_2> smooth scroll to the top i meant.
[06:38:07] <BillCriswell> lol so many damn script tags.
[06:39:22] <BillCriswell> I feel gross after like 3 plugins.
[06:40:01] <BillCriswell> Mark_2: Don't these themes come with some type of documentation? I imagine it would have to tell you in there.
[06:40:20] <BillCriswell> Oh, looks like cycle2 with some weird effects.
[06:40:44] <Mark_2> sorry billcriswell, i didn’t mean to stress you out
[06:40:53] <Mark_2> totally not intended.
[06:41:02] <BillCriswell> Haha you didn't. The site did.
[06:41:25] <Mark_2> yeah, im having a bit of stress myself as well
[06:41:42] <wheeei> Is it possible to learn jQuery in 2 weeks with a programming background and strong knowledge of html and css?
[06:41:54] <hrust> BillCriswell: So is not possible on initialization? So I have to itterate through dataset after datatable initialization and add attr('data-id', myCurrentRowId) to each row?
[06:42:01] <Mark_2> omg

[06:42:25] <Mark_2> if you know java and html5 you should be able to wheeel.
[06:43:15] <wheeei> ok, thanx ;>
[06:43:32] <curiousmansi> i asked  a question on jquery ui autocomplete functionality , anyone can help me understand the source property significance
[06:44:01] <BillCriswell> hrust: I'm sure it is, but I don't enjoy figuring out datatables API.
[06:45:14] <BillCriswell> hrust: You can do something like $('table tr').attr('data-id', function (i) { return i; }); and that would give you like <tr data-id="1">
[06:45:31] <BillCriswell> Then you can just do $('table').dataTable()
[06:47:18] <Mark_2> i’d better get some sleep and come back tomorrow with loads of random questions.

[07:01:58] <ZionZee> hi all! is there any way to update/edit/even delete a django database record using query?
[07:04:33] <ZionZee> anyone?
[07:05:25] <ZionZee> *jquery
[07:06:01] <curiousmansi> someone can help me understanding the https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/autocomplete.js
[07:06:15] <curiousmansi> i want to understand the _initSource:
[07:09:40] <hrust> ZionZee: why dont you use ajax
[07:10:59] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: What's your goal?
[07:11:02] <arthurvr> curiousmansi: what piece of that code don’t you understand? I might or might not be able to help, but just ask your question
[07:12:27] <curiousmansi> arthurvr: I want to understand the source option, if i read the documentation http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source i couldn't understand
[07:12:53] <curiousmansi> so i am checking the code what it is doing. and what i need to pass
[07:13:55] <curiousmansi> BillCriswell: My goal is simple , just i need to use a autocomplete functionality in our application which is build on marionette and backbone
[07:14:38] <curiousmansi> arthurvr: If i c the code then i c  _initSource there
[07:20:12] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: Do you want to use that whole widget or just need to get some json from a source?
[07:20:54] <curiousmansi> i need autocomplete functionality as it says , it will search the word as i type
[07:22:36] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: Why do you want to understand exactly what's happening in _initSource() though? Is it just general curiosity or are you trying to figure something else out?
[07:23:54] <curiousmansi> BillCriswell: I read the documentation http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source . There are few terms which i couldn't understand
[07:24:18] <curiousmansi> so i thought i will check what's going behind the scene then i will understand
[07:24:49] <BillCriswell> Where are you getting the data for the auto complete?
[07:24:52] <arthurvr> I didn’t dig in totally, but looks like you’re looking at the docs (for latest version), while the code is master
[07:28:55] <curiousmansi> there will be a view which has model .
[07:29:19] <curiousmansi> model i getting data from a rest url
[07:31:08] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: Will you be doing the autocomplete on the server side or the client side? Like.. are you requesting everything and letting autocomplete sort it out or do you plan on only getting the data you need from the server.
[07:32:03] <curiousmansi> ooh , both are possible, then i have raise this question with the team
[07:32:21] <curiousmansi> but for time being they have provided only one url which gives all the data
[07:32:47] <curiousmansi> so lets assume we will go with 1st requesting everything
[07:36:33] <curiousmansi> i think source takes 3 kinds of parameter. So parameter 1 is for the case where all the data is requested
[07:36:46] <curiousmansi> param 2 is for the case when it is on server
[07:37:03] <curiousmansi> what is param 3 for and what is request and response
[07:37:54] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: Ok. I set up a demo and I'll try to help explain it. Don't hit it too hard cause it's githubs public api and might stop working: http://jsbin.com/sixune/1/edit?js,output
[07:38:45] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: You basically give source a function, which takes what the user entered and a callback as its arguments.
[07:39:57] <BillCriswell> Then you request the data you want with like $.getJSON or something, in the success callback for that (or done()) you use that response() argument to update what the autcomplete is retuning.
[07:40:44] <BillCriswell> I'm shocked there isn't a clearer example of that in the docs.
[07:43:03] <BillCriswell> Hmm... it's not filtering the results based on the term.
[07:43:08] <curiousmansi> yup
[07:43:16] <curiousmansi> its not working
[07:45:34] <BillCriswell> I'm just reading something wrong.
[07:46:10] <chargen> Hi I have an animation on a div that has overflow visible, but the animation takes place the overflow is overwritten to hidden. How can I make the animation show the overflow all the time. I found some solutions but none works.
[07:46:53] <dismist> example?
[07:47:02] <BillCriswell> Never used this with a function.
[07:47:28] <arthurvr> chargen: quick jsfiddle/bin might be handy.
[07:48:05] <curiousmansi> BillCriswell:  Hi ! I got some idea
[07:48:05] <chargen> is just a div with overflowing contents and an animation changing right positioning
[07:48:11] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: http://jsbin.com/sixune/1/edit?js,output there we go.
[07:48:17] <BillCriswell> You have to filter it out yourself.
[07:49:02] <BillCriswell> "A request object, with a single term property" I missed that.
[07:50:12] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: Though, if that data isn't changing a lot you can just get the data before you initialize the auto complete.
[07:52:23] <baako> if you use angular js can you write php in the .js file?
[07:53:54] <greengriminal> So i am having an issue with my selectors in my console. They are not working and I've referenced this SO question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11242586/jquery-selectors-dont-work-in-console and still have no luck.
[07:55:32] <OnceMe> How do I change value of id in attribute?
[07:55:42] <OnceMe> <div id="me" value="changeme"></div> ?
[07:55:52] <OnceMe> with .attr()?
[07:56:49] <BillCriswell> culturelabs: http://jsbin.com/sixune/2/edit?js,output this is how I'd approach it if the data didn't change frequently.
[07:56:58] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: ^^
[07:57:06] <curiousmansi> hi
[07:57:59] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: .attr('id', 'changed')
[07:58:09] <curiousmansi> i understood the 1 and 3 type of values of source
[07:58:23] <curiousmansi> what about the 2nd which is string
[07:58:39] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: That's the one where you'd search on the server
[07:59:10] <curiousmansi> so every keypress is a call
[07:59:31] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: I'm not positive but I imagine it's throttled on input events.
[07:59:52] <curiousmansi> ?
[07:59:56] <BillCriswell> keypress events would be overkill for autocomplete.
[08:00:52] <BillCriswell> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-delay
[08:01:41] <BillCriswell> With the string you're basically doing /server?term=whatsinsearchbox on every input event (almost like keypress, but only fires on keys that actually produce output).
[08:02:13] <baako> hi guys in my php i am doing return true; now in ajax i want to do success: function(data) { if(!data) { do something } else { its true }
[08:02:17] <baako> is that right?
[08:03:21] <curiousmansi> hmmm , actually produce output i am not understood
[08:03:24] <curiousmansi> but anyways thanks
[08:03:30] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: Ok.
[08:03:30] <curiousmansi> make sense to me
[08:03:38] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: That was my goal.
[08:03:56] <BillCriswell> baako: If you're literally doing <?php return true; ?> There won't be any output.
[08:04:15] <curiousmansi> how to decide on milisec
[08:04:26] <curiousmansi> should i check with the backend team on this
[08:04:35] <curiousmansi> for delay
[08:04:54] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: I would. You don't want to hammer the server... but if you're just requesting the data all at once and it's not updated frequently no reason to worry about that.
[08:04:54] <baako>  BillCriswell i want to do something is php return true or false. what is the best approach?
[08:06:29] <curiousmansi> so again got some confusion. You showed me example1 and example2
[08:06:48] <BillCriswell> baako: You can do like <?php echo json_encode(array('success' => false)) and then in the callback do like.. if (data.status) {}
[08:06:56] <curiousmansi> example2 is same as local data , delay can be 0
[08:07:04] <curiousmansi> ?
[08:07:40] <BillCriswell> if (data.success) {} I meant... hopefully hobviously.
[08:08:11] <BillCriswell> curiousmansi: If the data isn't changing and only needs to be grabbed once per page load I'd do this approach: http://jsbin.com/sixune/2/edit
[08:09:09] <BillCriswell> It's one request per page load, instead of however much they type.
[08:09:55] <curiousmansi> it is same as local data na
[08:09:57] <curiousmansi> ?
[08:10:29] <curiousmansi> example1 : when we are getting the data after each keypress on some delay
[08:10:49] <curiousmansi> ok that we can check our network to c what is happening
[08:11:00] <curiousmansi> how many requests are called and stuff
[08:11:06] <curiousmansi> k leaving now
[08:11:10] <curiousmansi> thanks for the help
[08:11:17] <curiousmansi> any last inputs
[08:11:18] <curiousmansi> ?
[08:11:49] <BillCriswell> No. Don't think so.
[08:13:39] <djam90> Just booked jQuery UK conference :D
[08:14:17] <BillCriswell> djam90: I should do that one of these days.
[08:14:37] <djam90> BillCriswell, you're going this year?
[08:14:56] <BillCriswell> I doubt it. I haven't researched it at all yet.
[08:15:11] <djam90> there are still tickets :)
[08:15:50] <DeltaHeavy> Hey everybody. I'm wondering how I can select only the direct child for an event using on(). Not quite sure how to explain it but I think this line of code will clear it up again, especially the second parameter of on(). Any help is much appreciated:    $('#flyOutConnectorShop .listViewConnector').on('hover', '> li', function () {
[08:16:33] <raj_> hi
[08:16:38] <arthurvr> DeltaHeavy: Maybe create a fiddle/jsbin? Nobody likes big chunks of code in IRC + this kind of things can be confusing.
[08:16:56] <arthurvr> Hi raj_!
[08:17:15] <raj_> can u guys tell me why i am getting this warning imagemin:dist
[08:17:39] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: not sure hover bubbles? Maybe try mouseenter?
[08:17:44] <BillCriswell> djam90: I'm in the states and I'm not seeing one near by?
[08:17:48] <raj_> running imagemin:dist (imagemin)task
[08:17:58] <djam90> BillCriswell, ohhh, I thought UK haha :)
[08:18:17] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell, arthurvr: Basically I want the equivilent to the first line there to work with on(). My attempt being the second line of JS there doesn't work: https://pastee.org/bj9az
[08:18:48] <arthurvr> DeltaHeavy: thanks.
[08:19:23] <OnceMe> uhm
[08:19:23] <tdelam> I have a ton of td's on a page, kind of like a calendar, each one of the td's has a little tid bit of data from the database. I want to open a bootstrap modal when one is clicked and load the modal with data based on the which td was clicked, my question is how do I know which modal was clicked so I can load the appropriate data?
[08:19:24] <DeltaHeavy> arthurvr: No thanks needed. Thank you for just looking at this.
[08:19:29] <OnceMe> I have $(selector).append(somestuff);
[08:19:35] <OnceMe> how can I remove appended stuff if error occured?
[08:19:42] <OnceMe> can I do var obj = $selector.append(stuff);
[08:19:48] <OnceMe> if error { obj.remove(); } ?
[08:19:59] <DarkGhost> Hey guys, I was in here pretty late last night trying to figure out why my ajax call won't save the cookie getting sent back... any ideas?
[08:20:08] <BillCriswell> tdelam: Put an id or something on the <tr> so you can figure it out.
[08:20:43] <tdelam> BillCriswell: an id containing some sort of data identifier as well I assume?
[08:21:48] <BillCriswell> tdelam: Yeah, typically something like <tr data-id="abc123"> then on click of the td you can get the .closest() tr's .data('id')
[08:22:05] <BillCriswell> .closest('tr').data('id')
[08:22:08] <arthurvr> DeltaHeavy: is this a good replication of your situation? http://jsfiddle.net/fodtwu9x/
[08:22:48] <arthurvr> DeltaHeavy: If I don’t get you wrong this is it right?
[08:22:50] <Tennis> o/ I'm appending strings to a string and later I'd like to remove one of the appended strings , how can I do that ?
[08:22:55] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: Do you just want to remove stuff or all of selector?
[08:23:13] <OnceMe> remove appended stuff only
[08:23:19] <arthurvr> Tennis: I’ll suggest you to just don’t use a string but an array then
[08:23:26] <tdelam> BillCriswell: I see and I can then do some sort of ajax call or whatever else I need.
[08:23:31] <tdelam> thanks BillCriswell
[08:23:36] <BillCriswell> tdelam: No problem.
[08:23:38] <arthurvr> Tennis: which you can later transform into a string
[08:23:51] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell any idea for me? you always seem to know someething
[08:24:16] <DeltaHeavy> arthurvr: Pretty much yes...not sure why mine isn't working then lol.
[08:24:21] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: I am not familiar with your issue.
[08:24:26] <DeltaHeavy> Didn't think that was possible, using the '>' operator there.
[08:24:30] <Tennis> arthurvr, that sounds sensible. Can I still use appendTo to add to the array?
[08:24:50] <arthurvr> DeltaHeavy: that’s why we always ask for jsbin/fiddle, because it might be other code causing it.
[08:25:00] <arthurvr> DeltaHeavy: Anyhow, you’re welcome if you have more questions
[08:25:02] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell I'm sending an $.post to /auth/login, it's returning success and if I look in the network tab I can see a Set-Cookie: session, but then I make a $.get to /auth/check which just retruns if i'm logged in or not and it isn't saying I am
[08:25:08] <DarkGhost> however this same process works on postman
[08:25:15] <DeltaHeavy> arthurvr: This is working now...I must have made some sort of other mistake and overlooked it. Thanks!
[08:25:59] <arthurvr> Tennis: maybe you should try to replicate your situation in a fiddle/jsbin?
[08:26:16] <OnceMe> so how?
[08:26:22] <arthurvr> Tennis: just so we can help you as efficient as possible
[08:26:24] <Tennis> arthurvr, good advice back in a bit then
[08:26:33] <arthurvr> You’re welcome, Tennis
[08:26:37] <Tennis> sure very reasonably phrased
[08:26:51] <BillCriswell> Tennis: Just do like var parts = ['start string']; parts.push('more of the string') and when you need the whole string do parts.join(' ') and you can remove the parts you need with like .pop() and .shift()
[08:27:05] <BillCriswell> Oh, didn't see arthurvr reply.
[08:27:43] <arthurvr> I was confusing because you was talking about appendTo and stuff, but BillCriswell’s reply was the way I was going to suggest stuff
[08:27:44] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: There's a lot of gray area in that question.
[08:28:34] <baako> why is this not showing at all before it fadeout? $("#Awaiting").html(data).fadeOut(1600);
[08:29:41] <BillCriswell> Becuase you're not telling it to wait before you fadeOut
[08:31:07] <BillCriswell> baako: You cnan do like $('#Awaiting').html(data).delay(1600).fadeOut();
[08:31:14] <BillCriswell> Which is what I think you were aiming for.
[08:33:22] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:so how to depend
[08:33:27] <OnceMe> destroy appended stuff?
[08:33:51] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: You can select it and remove it, or keep a reference to it.
[08:34:52] <OnceMe> how to keep a refernce?
[08:37:23] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: http://jsbin.com/tedibu/1/edit?html,css,js,output something like this
[08:38:05] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell what do you want to know.
[08:38:09] <DarkGhost> I've tried everything!
[08:38:52] <BillCriswell> There's just a lot going on that I might not be aware of. If it works one place and not the other I'd just try to figure out the difference between the two.
[08:40:25] <OnceMe> ok that worked :D
[08:41:18] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell It's something to do with postman not being a browser. I think it's a browser issue.. probably CORS?
[08:41:19] <DarkGhost> I'm not sure
[08:41:32] <BillCriswell> Me either.
[08:50:12] <DarkGhost> <3 BillCriswell  thank you anywy
[08:50:14] <Omar-> hello
[08:50:26] <BillCriswell> Welcome. Sorry I couldn't be more useful.
[08:51:29] <Omar-> why dont ppl come here and ask about jQM? :(
[08:51:41] <monstordh> I'm using the jQuery Mobile Menu Slider (mmenu) for the first time and I've gotten it to work. However, it is implemented continuously. I I don't know to turn it off for desktop resolutions. I'm looking for a way to only call the script when the viewport is less than 700px wide. I am currently running some jQuery to switch style sheets based on the viewport size, but I don't know how to UNinvoke the menu script conditionally. I just know enough jQuery t
[08:51:42] <monstordh> get around. Any pointers you can give me would be appreciated.
[08:51:53] <Omar-> they all go to the screwed stackoverflow looking for help
[08:52:00] <Omar-> yaay
[08:53:12] <Omar-> monstordh simply, if ( $(window).width() > 700 ) { dont initialize it }
[08:53:57] <monstordh> Omar-: Thanks. I understand how to invoke it based on the viewport width. Let me clarify. I need to know how to UNinvoke it if the screen size is expanded beyond 700px
[08:54:37] <Omar-> monstordh how do you call mmenu? button click?
[08:56:28] <monstordh> Omar-: Well, that's not the part I'm dealing with. It's the initialization of the script that I need to deal with. When the script is initialized (on screen load), it extracts the contents from my existing menu and reformats it for the mobile menu. I need to UNdo that when the screen size it expanded.
[08:56:39] <monstordh> Need me to pastebin some code?
[08:57:14] <Omar-> monstordh yes please, maybe a working example would be great
[08:58:25] <monstordh> Here's the site for the menu. You can see it in action here: http://mmenu.frebsite.nl/
[08:58:51] <monstordh> As you notice, the menu is present at all times. It does not switch between desktop & mobile versions
[08:59:00] <Omar-> I saw it,
[09:00:25] <Omar-> monstordh you want to destory it if window's width is greater than 700? or you dont want it "initalize" it if window's width..etc?
[09:00:46] <monstordh> I guess I would like to destroy it and restore my initial menu
[09:01:15] <monstordh> Let me show you a working example, which may be a little hackish
[09:01:38] <monstordh> http://staging.rock-pond.com/
[09:01:58] <Omar-> monstordh I dont think there's a "destroy" method, so you'll need to do it manually
[09:02:05] <monstordh> Suggestions?
[09:02:12] <Omar-> and keep a hidden copy of your original menu
[09:02:22] <monstordh> ah
[09:02:24] <monstordh> gotcha
[09:02:30] <monstordh> that's what I'm doing on this other site
[09:02:33] <Omar-> why dont you use jQM's panel?
[09:02:41] <ash_m> can you get .css('background-color') to return a color in a format other than rgb()?
[09:02:42] <monstordh> no clue what you're talking about
[09:03:03] <Omar-> monstordh you said you're using jQuery-Mobile framework
[09:03:13] <Omar-> or you mean jQuery for Mobile website?
[09:03:17] <Omar-> meant*
[09:03:24] <monstordh> Omar-: No. I said I was using the jQuery Mobile Menu Slider
[09:04:01] <Omar-> so you aren't using jQuery-Mobile
[09:04:12] <Omar-> ?g jQuery-Mobile
[09:04:14] <b-ot> Omar-: jQuery Mobile → http://jquerymobile.com/
[09:04:19] <monstordh> not unless this script utilizes it
[09:04:43] <Omar-> it doesn't matter anyway
[09:05:02] <Omar-> the link you've given is broken
[09:05:17] <monstordh> which link?
[09:07:55] <Omar-> http://staging.rock-pond.com/
[09:08:36] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:
[09:08:38] <OnceMe> here?
[09:08:55] <OnceMe> When I append element, Reply, and I click on reply, it does not open textarea
[09:09:04] <OnceMe> that happens only on appended Reply
[09:09:13] <OnceMe> when I load page, Reply works fine and opens textarea...? why
[09:09:33] <ash_m> maybe I had a dumb question
[09:10:46] <BillCriswell> ash_m: You could convert it probably.
[09:11:36] <ash_m> BillCriswell: yeah, it's actually quite an elaborate function... I was hoping there was something integral to jquery that would do it for me
[09:13:57] <OnceMe> nvm solved it
[09:14:00] <OnceMe> I use delegate/on
[09:14:29] <BillCriswell> ash_m: Don't believe so.
[09:14:51] <BillCriswell> ash_m: Why do you need the color?
[09:15:18] <ash_m> BillCriswell: I just wanted to print them aside colored boxes... I'm sort of making a puzzle
[09:15:30] <ash_m> http://jsfiddle.net/kp6sd05n/2/
[09:16:42] <ash_m> BillCriswell: as you can see, I am having trouble just printing rgb values
[09:16:49] <MadLems> Might someone help me understand this line of jQuery in plain englih?  var a_tag = $( 'a[href="' + $( '#imagelightbox' ).attr( 'src' ) + '"]' );
[09:16:55] <ash_m> BillCriswell: this works like I expect: http://jsfiddle.net/kp6sd05n/4/
[09:17:52] <MadLems> alternatively, what's the best way to examine what is returned from $()?  I'm trying JSON.stringify(a_tag) but the output doesn't seem ideal
[09:18:00] <ash_m> BillCriswell: but throw this into the mix and it fails: http://jsfiddle.net/kp6sd05n/5/ (line 19: I added a .css())
[09:18:19] <BillCriswell> ash_m: What about using :after?
[09:18:25] <ash_m> MadLems: console.log($()) ?
[09:19:01] <ash_m> BillCriswell: I see your point; I'll rig that up instead :)
[09:19:07] <arthurvr> MadLems: if it’s just for debugging/dev purposes the command line API is fine.
[09:19:10] <MadLems> ash_m: oh that's much better i think. thanks
[09:19:15] <monstordh> Omar-: Gotcha. I realized they've restricted access to my IP, since it's in development stage
[09:19:18] <BillCriswell> ash_m: Yeah, like &:after { content: $hsl }
[09:19:35] <arthurvr> MadLems: that’s basically everything in here: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/commandline-api
[09:19:45] <Omar-> monstordh it's okay, I've created a demo http://jsfiddle.net/ofaa2req/
[09:19:58] <arthurvr> MadLems: things like console.log, dir, …
[09:20:12] <Omar-> hello arthurvr :)
[09:20:37] * arthurvr waves to Omar-
[09:20:46] <Omar-> hehe
[09:21:26] <monstordh> Omar-: Holy cow. Did you already have all of that code somewhere?
[09:21:47] <Omar-> monstordh copied it from their demo site :P
[09:21:56] <monstordh> gotcha :)
[09:22:26] <Omar-> so now you need to create your own way of "destroy" and restore your desktop menu
[09:22:26] <BillCriswell> ash_m: Hm, converts them to hex.
[09:22:32] <BillCriswell> or blue
[09:23:04] <ash_m> BillCriswell: yeah, it's supposed to, but I'm not going to use the hsl() function
[09:23:20] <BillCriswell> Ah ok, then http://jsfiddle.net/kp6sd05n/6/ should get you close enough.
[09:24:14] <Es0teric> has anyone here used this: http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/ ?
[09:25:45] <arthurvr> Es0teric: I think I did once
[09:26:27] <Es0teric> arthurvr: alright, cool.. have you used the ajax functionality of it?
[09:27:03] <arthurvr> I don’t think so… what’s up with it?
[09:28:02] <Es0teric> arthurvr: well i am trying to log the output of my search query
[09:28:34] <arthurvr> Honestly, I probably knew this, but not anymore. Someone?
[09:28:51] <robertmaxrees> just a console.log() of the data?
[09:29:23] <arthurvr> ya.. seems reasonable
[09:29:41] <MadLems> so when i console.log(possible_p_tag), I get this: http://i.imgur.com/YhHebBN.png I expected the p.wp-caption-text, as I'm expecting possible_p_tag to be a paragraph with that class. What's the div#view-article-body there for?
[09:29:47] <jeffreylevesque> when I try to get the mime type of my xml file, it says not recognized - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/html/machine-learning/test/xml/sample.xml
[09:29:49] <robertmaxrees> looks like the load method takes a standard jquery $.ajax() call
[09:30:03] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric should be able to do it in the success callback of said call.
[09:30:16] <ash_m> BillCriswell: voila: http://jsfiddle.net/kp6sd05n/7/
[09:30:24] <robertmaxrees> MadLems can you share a code example?
[09:30:30] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: MadLems: Oh yes. It does. But this depends on where you would like to that.
[09:30:37] <arthurvr> and indeed a jsfiddle/bin might be nice
[09:30:46] <jeffreylevesque> I'm using jquery validator - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/form_validator.js#L65
[09:30:51] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: yeah i have that in my ajax call
[09:33:06] <monstordh> Omar-: yes
[09:33:21] <monstordh> Omar-: Sorry for the delay. I'm being bombarded with multiple issues from clients
[09:34:32] <Omar-> monstordh it's ok. if you can edit that fiddle with your actual content, i'd play around with it
[09:34:47] <monstordh> thanks
[09:35:59] <ash_m> BillCriswell: do you like the quote: "Python is a drop in replacement for BASIC much like Optimus Prime is a drop in replacement for a truck"?
[09:36:08] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/R6AjMaR5
[09:36:26] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: my ajax call returns the response with an array of data
[09:37:03] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric okay.  what's the issue?
[09:37:17] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: its not logging the data for me to display the results
[09:37:56] <robertmaxrees> put the console.log() in the success callback
[09:37:59] <robertmaxrees> not the render.
[09:38:25] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: so then i dont understand why in the documentation its saying to use callback()
[09:39:02] <pilgrimish> hey there, is there any way to set a focus on page load? i’m trying to tie keyboard directional keys to a carousel, but every time the page loads, the keyboard directional keys default to scrubbing individual videos...
[09:39:07] <BillCriswell> ash_m: I don't really understand it lol.
[09:39:16] <BillCriswell> BUT I think I get the gist.
[09:39:29] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric the callback() is the function you define.
[09:39:58] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: yeah i get that but i dont understand the purpose of the render param then
[09:40:03] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric put your console log before callback() and you're good to go.
[09:40:14] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: yes i get that but i am trying to display an output
[09:40:27] <robertmaxrees> you're changing what you want.
[09:40:29] <Es0teric> i thought viewing the data is fine but i am trying to get it so the viewer can see it
[09:40:42] <robertmaxrees> then use the example they've provided.
[09:40:47] <robertmaxrees> that should work fine.
[09:41:52] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: thats what i’ve been using
[09:42:01] <Es0teric> and its not working fine right now
[09:42:02] <robertmaxrees> then what's the problem?
[09:42:42] <Es0teric> the problem is robertmaxrees that ultimately based on my ajax request and the data its returning is not outputting to the user to see
[09:42:58] <Es0teric> yeah i can see it in the console but again, its not in the dropdown list that it creates
[09:42:58] <robertmaxrees> then it sounds like you're not properly parsing through it.
[09:43:34] <robertmaxrees> okay, so the real problem has nothing to do with console logging the data and everything to do with data not outputting?
[09:43:51] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: indeed
[09:43:59] <MikeD_> how do I set an attribute on a jquery object reference?  i thought it'd be myjqref.attr("title","foo");  but nope.
[09:44:12] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ .prop() or .attr()
[09:44:24] <ash_m> BillCriswell: you mean the quote? I thought it was funny despite never having programmed in BASIC
[09:44:32] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:44:42] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric lol then why ask about the console log thing in the first place?  either way, run through the render option and make sure you're parsing the returned data correctly.
[09:45:03] <ash_m> BillCriswell: I mean, just the vision of replacing any truck utility with optimus prime is pretty funny
[09:45:11] <BillCriswell> Agreed.
[09:45:59] <iura> Hi
[09:46:26] <iura> Is anyone here that can help me?
[09:46:32] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ iura
[09:46:32] <b-ot> iura: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:46:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:46:55] <ash_m> BillCriswell: how about the quote "`Java` is to `Javascript` what `Car` is to `Carpet`" ?
[09:47:15] <MikeD_> java is to javascript what ham is to hamburger
[09:47:25] <BillCriswell> Mmmm, hamburger.
[09:47:46] <BillCriswell> Fuck I'm too hungry for that kind of analogy.
[09:48:16] <iura> nice community
[09:48:19] <iura> I can t install Jquery on my PC!
[09:48:34] <robertmaxrees> iura you don't install it on your computer.
[09:48:34] <MikeD_> nobody can "install" jquery
[09:48:41] <iura> And I don't know where to go?!!
[09:48:43] <robertmaxrees> you include it on your website.
[09:48:59] <ash_m> I'm actually wondering if the ham/hamburger analogy is better than the car/carpet one sepecifically because of it's similarity despite not drawing as much of a contrast
[09:49:19] <BillCriswell> I accidentally ordered some ham instead of a hamburger once. I was so upset.
[09:49:21] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: alright this doesnt make any sense anymore… its like what dude wrote on github is not the same as his demo page
[09:49:34] <iura> Yes, but way I can't open .js files
[09:49:45] <robertmaxrees> iura that's not how jquery works.
[09:49:49] <ash_m> iura: http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/
[09:49:50] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric are you copy/pasting things and just expecting them to work?
[09:50:02] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: no i am trying to figure out why this tagging isnt working
[09:50:22] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric have you tried doing it with raw data, instead of with the ajax?
[09:50:25] <robertmaxrees> just to get that part working?
[09:50:40] <robertmaxrees> iura back up - why are you trying to "install jquery" on your computer?
[09:50:49] <iura> yes
[09:51:21] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i mean i know the ajax is returning data my problem right now is displaying the results
[09:51:42] <iura> I try to write some code in .js
[09:51:44] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i am trying to use “tagging” http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/ with ajax
[09:51:45] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric can you setup a fiddle then?
[09:52:08] <robertmaxrees> iura you have a few options.
[09:52:14] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: how am i supposed to simulate the ajax on a fiddle?
[09:52:29] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric that's half of why i suggested to abstract that part out and get it working without the ajax :)
[09:52:35] <iura> I can't open .js files, and work wi them
[09:52:44] <robertmaxrees> to write code in them?
[09:52:49] <robertmaxrees> or to run then code in them?
[09:53:05] <iura> to write code
[09:53:31] <robertmaxrees> iura you'll have to right-click and select "open with"
[09:53:40] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i’ll think about it but i’ll have a fiddle for you a bit later i am going to run out to get some lunch
[09:53:55] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric i may or may not be able to help then, so pop it out to the room :)
[09:54:04] <iura> and
[09:54:22] <robertmaxrees> ?
[09:54:52] <iura> open with
[09:55:03] <robertmaxrees> and select something to edit it with...
[09:55:13] <robertmaxrees> you can use notepad, though most people don't.
[09:55:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd install something like submlime text and use that, instead.
[09:55:38] <MadLems> thanks the help everyone. finally figured out the cause of my headaches: a debugging add-on was duplicating most of the content on the page, so i was working with vastly different html than expected >.<
[09:55:59] <iura> comodo is good?
[09:56:09] <robertmaxrees> never heard of it.
[09:56:17] <iura> :0
[09:56:20] <iura> :)
[09:56:33] <iura> komodo
[09:56:43] <iura> ok
[09:56:48] <robertmaxrees> heard of it, never used it.
[09:57:03] <iura> thank you for help!
[09:57:10] <iura> robert
[09:57:51] <iura> take care, buy
[09:58:01] <jeffreylevesque> any suggestions between: ember, angular, and backbone?
[09:58:13] <robertmaxrees> backbone
[09:58:13] <NoiseEee> hang yourself
[09:58:20] <robertmaxrees> or go with anything else.
[09:58:27] <robertmaxrees> riot and react are nicer imo.
[09:58:37] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: lol
[09:58:40] <robertmaxrees> some people like angular.  i call them "sadists"
[09:58:45] <NoiseEee> whatever you choose will being you frustration and regret
[09:58:53] <NoiseEee> thats about the only guarantee of a framework these days
[09:59:14] <NoiseEee> semi jk
[09:59:23] <jeffreylevesque> yah, i applied to some full stack position - they asked my familiarity with the three frameworks
[10:00:13] <NoiseEee> as in asking your advice on what you'd choose?
[10:00:22] <NoiseEee> or more of the full-stack unicorn of "OH YEAH I KNOW ALL 3"
[10:00:27] <jeffreylevesque> it's all the same thing, javascript -> jquery -> [something on the block framework]
[10:01:03] <jeffreylevesque> i told the recruiter, i could learn either frameworks in 3 days - just give me an exercise
[10:01:59] <OnceMe> how to strip text from xss while I append it
[10:02:08] <OnceMe> I tried document create node but I get [object Text]
[10:02:35] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe do what now?
[10:02:42] <robertmaxrees> have an example?
[10:02:48] <OnceMe> code http://pastebin.com/9zG197aK
[10:03:02] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe you can't do that.
[10:03:11] <OnceMe> how to do it then?
[10:03:21] <OnceMe> I just want to strip <> tags, so I wont be vuln to xss attacks
[10:03:38] <OnceMe> and also to not allow appends with tags such as <Strong><font color etc etc..>>
[10:03:41] <cjohnson> concat the strings inside the createTextNode
[10:03:43] <MikeD_> how does that help?
[10:03:48] <cjohnson> don't try to concat a TextNode to a string
[10:03:58] <OnceMe> ?
[10:04:02] <robertmaxrees> textNodes are like any other DOM node.
[10:04:05] <OnceMe> I'm not sure I follow
[10:04:12] <cuppy> ash_m, thanks  for the clear explanation RE http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/
[10:04:14] <cjohnson> you're trying to add a string and an object together
[10:04:16] <robertmaxrees> like a div or a p or a span.
[10:04:27] <OnceMe> is there a simple method which handles this for me?
[10:04:43] <robertmaxrees> don't use createTextNode
[10:04:52] <robertmaxrees> find some other way to encode that text.
[10:04:54] <OnceMe> ok what to use?
[10:05:32] <cjohnson> just replace < with &lt;
[10:05:35] <cjohnson> and > with &gt;
[10:05:40] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:05:41] <OnceMe> ok thaks
[10:05:42] <OnceMe> :D
[10:05:44] <robertmaxrees> a simple .replace()
[10:06:06] <cjohnson> second result: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24816/escaping-html-strings-with-jquery
[10:06:13] <robertmaxrees> *for you
[10:06:24] <robertmaxrees> keep in mind google can and does tune results per user.
[10:06:42] <cjohnson> I mean look at the second response on that SO
[10:06:44] <pilgrimish> hey there, is there any way to set a focus on page load? i’m trying to tie keyboard directional keys to a carousel, but every time the page loads, the keyboard directional keys default to scrubbing individual videos...
[10:06:47] <cjohnson> it's a replace function
[10:06:47] <robertmaxrees> oh hah
[10:06:49] <cjohnson> handles quotes too
[10:08:46] <OnceMe> so var xss = text.html(); will do the work?
[10:08:48] <jeffreylevesque> should xml be compared to `text/xml`, or `application/xml`?
[10:08:54] <coby> pilgrimish, that sounds like a cool project. I don't know, but I hope you find the answer.
[10:09:22] <pilgrimish> coby: thanks anyway
[10:09:36] <cjohnson> OnceMe: the second comment. after that one
[10:09:43] <cjohnson> it's just a replace, there's no jquery or DOM involved
[10:09:46] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/12034334 this one
[10:09:54] <pilgrimish> anyone else have any pointers?
[10:09:56] <cjohnson> how'd you get that link?
[10:09:58] <OnceMe> yeah that worked
[10:10:03] <cjohnson> oh share
[10:10:09] <robertmaxrees> yep
[10:10:13] <cjohnson> danke
[10:10:28] <robertmaxrees> pilgrimish are you setting .focus() anywhere?
[10:10:35] <pilgrimish> not on that page
[10:10:42] <robertmaxrees> then do that.
[10:10:42] <pilgrimish> maybe focus() is not what i need to be using
[10:10:52] <robertmaxrees> you want to set focus on pageload.
[10:10:53] <robertmaxrees> right?
[10:10:55] <pilgrimish> in the body tag, onload=“” etc etc
[10:11:00] <cryptopsy> i have centered my content (jqueryui), but now i want the accordion to fill the space it takes up. In firebug, you can see its the same height as the image (this is what i want), yet the accordion doesn't know how to fill this space. cpov.info for code
[10:11:28] <robertmaxrees> $(function() { $('#someInput').focus() });
[10:11:41] <pilgrimish> robertmaxrees: well, i want the page to not focus on individual videos, so i can course through the carousel on page load...
[10:11:50] <pilgrimish> i thought that might be focus(), but maybe not...?
[10:11:52] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: made some progess since yesterday
[10:12:02] <cryptopsy> using css's flex
[10:12:59] <robertmaxrees> pilgrimish what have you tried?
[10:13:06] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle or something similar to demonstrate?
[10:14:10] <pilgrimish> i can set one up
[10:14:17] <pilgrimish> i’ve tried <body onload="document.vimeovideo.focus()”>
[10:14:22] <robertmaxrees> don't use onload()
[10:14:26] <pilgrimish> gotcha
[10:14:34] <robertmaxrees> and that's not the right way to use .focus()
[10:14:40] <robertmaxrees> see the snippet i put up earlier?
[10:15:04] <pilgrimish> yup
[10:15:28] <robertmaxrees> you'll want something like that.
[10:16:37] <pilgrimish> tried to use body, no dice
[10:16:47] <pilgrimish> i’ll setup a fiddle
[10:16:50] <robertmaxrees> thanks.
[10:20:56] <ash_m> cuppy: you're welcome? I wasn't sure I was answering your question, but there is a lot of helpful information on that page
[10:21:38] <cuppy> ash_m, yah I was just skimming. I knew there were good reasons, but I hadn't been interested enough in them to Google it.
[10:28:45] <jim_j> hi
[10:29:00] <arthurvr> hi jim_j!
[10:29:15] <jim_j> hey arthurvr
[10:29:54] <jim_j> in some news sites I've seen that when you copy a paragraph or a sentence, and paste it, it appends a link to the article.  can that be done via jQuery?
[10:30:48] <Omar-> !mdn paste
[10:30:50] <b-ot> Omar-: Midas editor module security preferences - Midas | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Midas/Security_preferences
[10:31:16] <Omar-> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/paste
[10:31:37] <robertmaxrees> Omar- they want to append a link to copied text.
[10:32:05] <jim_j> yes
[10:32:11] <Omar-> i thought append a link on paste
[10:32:12] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/4777746
[10:32:24] <Omar-> anyway, paste isn't supported by IE,Safari
[10:32:35] <robertmaxrees> Omar- that's not what they were looking for anyway :)
[10:33:06] <jim_j> thanks robert!
[10:33:35] <jim_j> yeah, it's more if I copy text and paste it somewhere else, like in an Email or chat
[10:33:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[10:33:46] <jim_j> cool
[10:34:02] <mrchris> Question :-) :  I need a way to display a block of text to a user and have them be able to mark different sections of the text in different colours.   Is this easily possible?
[10:35:30] <robertmaxrees> not sure if it'd b "easy", but certainly doable.
[10:42:11] <pilgrimish> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/Pilgrimish/qc3z6o6b/
[10:42:37] <pilgrimish> in this example, even after i click, the directional keys don’t actually function
[10:42:48] <pilgrimish> which is not intended functionality at all
[10:43:21] <robertmaxrees> pilgrimish :) open your web console.
[10:43:39] <pilgrimish> yup
[10:43:51] <robertmaxrees> so what is that supposed to be?
[10:45:54] <pilgrimish> i see the slider is not defined
[10:46:05] <robertmaxrees> there is no variable "slider" in there.
[10:50:10] <robertmaxrees> pilgrimish start here: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qc3z6o6b/6/
[10:52:04] <OnceMe> hey
[10:52:04] <pilgrimish> ok, so that’s what it’s doing on my site… but notice how you have to click the result area in order to activate the keyboard keys
[10:52:15] <OnceMe> Will generating token one time when user login, prevent comment spam?
[10:52:27] <OnceMe> is it hard to make a bot which gets current csrf token and makes comments spam?
[10:52:35] <robertmaxrees> pilgrimish that's because it's an iframe in the fiddle.
[10:52:49] <robertmaxrees> try with this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qc3z6o6b/7/
[10:53:08] <fkt> $('container2 > left')   is that the correct way to access a nested div called left within div container2  ?
[10:53:10] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe it's pretty trivial to do that
[10:53:20] <robertmaxrees> fkt "called left" as inn....?
[10:53:30] <robertmaxrees> you likely need a . or # in front of those.
[10:53:42] <OnceMe> hmm so what is a good way to prevent comment spam?
[10:53:51] <OnceMe> To allow only verified users by email to leave comments?
[10:53:53] <fkt> robertmaxrees:  <div id="left"></div>
[10:54:01] <fkt> robertmaxrees: which is nested in container2 div
[10:54:11] <robertmaxrees> fkt is container2 an id or a class?
[10:54:20] <fkt> id of another div
[10:54:25] <robertmaxrees> then just do #left
[10:54:25] <fkt> parent div
[10:54:36] <robertmaxrees> IDs are unique, so you can only ever have one #left
[10:55:02] <fkt> ah, let me try.  i'm just trying to break a div into three parts..left center right..for mapping some charts side by side
[10:55:05] <fkt> thanks
[10:55:32] <robertmaxrees> if it were a class, $('#container2 > .left') would get the .left that's a direct child of #container2 - you could just $('#container2 .left') instead and that'd get any child .left of #container2
[10:56:18] <OnceMe> ????
[10:56:20] <OnceMe> what is the good way
[10:56:28] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe by requiring email signup.
[10:56:32] <OnceMe> yes
[10:56:37] <robertmaxrees> that's the good way.
[10:56:40] <OnceMe> so only email verified users can post comments right?
[10:56:48] <robertmaxrees> require that the user sign up and log in to leave comments.
[10:57:05] <OnceMe> so what if I make a bot and manually make account and verify it?
[10:57:23] <robertmaxrees> most bots won't go that far.
[10:58:17] <OnceMe> ok
[10:58:18] <robertmaxrees> you can include something like akismet or the new recaptcha
[11:01:33] <OnceMe> nah
[11:01:36] <OnceMe> I dont want recaptcha
[11:01:43] <OnceMe> how akismet work?
[11:01:59] <robertmaxrees> why not recaptcha?
[11:02:02] <robertmaxrees> have you seen the new one?
[11:02:17] <cryptopsy> can you please make my accordion fill its height, without breaking the centering or fixed width on the container? http://cpov.info
[11:02:20] <robertmaxrees> literally a checkbox for like 95% of your users.
[11:02:49] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy what's supposed to take up the high?
[11:02:51] <robertmaxrees> *height?
[11:03:32] <robertmaxrees> and we won't do it for you.
[11:03:36] <robertmaxrees> we'll help you figure it out.
[11:04:52] <DarkGhost> Hello, I want to make an ajax call and get the response before the dom loads, how would I do this and control what loads based on the result of that ajax call?
[11:05:11] <robertmaxrees> you... don't?
[11:05:20] <robertmaxrees> you fire the ajax call and then do everything in the success callback.
[11:05:46] <sniperh4x0r> Does anyone here know how to find work from home gigs doing jquery or similar development/
[11:06:14] <wovenhead> Hello all, I am experiencing an import conflict that is breaking some JQuery-UI functionality.
[11:06:25] <t0astt> I need help finding a plugin (or a technique, I guess). So I have a "Questions" table. Each has a "page number", as well as an "order". Table rows are sorted first by page number, and second by order. So for example, questions belonging to page 1 would appear first, but be sorted by order. Questions belonging to page 2 appear after the page 1 questions, and are sorted by order. Is there any plugin that would allow me to edit the "order", but have them al
[11:06:30] <DarkGhost> robertmaxrees theres no way to do it before the dom loads so there isnt that weird  transition?
[11:06:46] <robertmaxrees> DarkGhost you're doing things wrong >.>
[11:07:01] <robertmaxrees> your page should be minimal and only have what it needs to bootstrap the ajax request.
[11:07:04] <DarkGhost> well basically put in simple terms, I want to check if they're logged in first using an ajax call then hide the login box first
[11:07:10] <robertmaxrees> then you load whatever in the .done()
[11:07:17] <robertmaxrees> that should be done server-side, in that case.
[11:07:54] <DarkGhost> how would it control if login box or whatever is shown server-side?
[11:08:02] <DarkGhost> server side is just an api
[11:08:05] <robertmaxrees> by checking if the user is logged in.
[11:08:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:08:18] <robertmaxrees> how are you generating the box, then?
[11:08:52] <DarkGhost> im confused now lol
[11:09:13] <robertmaxrees> DarkGhost you'd normally test if the user is logged in server-side and then render out the login box conditionally.
[11:09:25] <DarkGhost> yeah thats what I'm trying to do
[11:09:26] <robertmaxrees> you don't show/hide based on an ajax call after the page has loaded.
[11:09:38] <robertmaxrees> what's your server-side language?
[11:09:50] <DarkGhost> I mean I'm not really coding the backend.. It's in GO though.
[11:09:57] <DarkGhost> the backend has a /auth/login and an /auth/check
[11:09:59] <robertmaxrees> you should use it in this case.
[11:10:11] <DarkGhost> auth/check will return good if you're logged in
[11:10:25] <robertmaxrees> there should be a way to check, on request, if the user is authenticated and if they are, render the login box.  otherwise, don't/.
[11:10:44] <cuppy> Does anyone remember user NSA? Someone seems to have taken his nick. Anyone know if he's like it back?
[11:11:07] <robertmaxrees> cuppy ask in #freenode?
[11:11:19] <DarkGhost> on request?
[11:11:28] <robertmaxrees> DarkGhost... yeah?
[11:11:53] <robertmaxrees> you have some kind of server-side templating going on, i'd assume, right?
[11:12:32] <DarkGhost> all I know is i want this to happen
[11:12:33] <DarkGhost> http://privatepaste.com/54617bc0c1
[11:12:56] <robertmaxrees> don't use javascript to do it.
[11:13:01] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point.
[11:13:06] <robertmaxrees> conditionally render that piece of html.
[11:13:33] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[11:20:05] <petzup> hy, i need little help with my script, http://jsfiddle.net/xyfhyacg/
[11:20:15] <petzup> here is my result and also what i want to get
[11:29:00] <monstordh> I'm trying to run a script to switch style sheets based on the current viewport width. It works great in my browser, but doesn't on my mobile device. Suggestions? Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/RfFanN1h
[11:30:05] <deseo> \quit
[11:32:04] <petzup> monstordh you need to use also on load
[11:32:43] <petzup> like: $(window).on('resize', function); $(window).on('load', function);
[11:33:36] <monstordh> petzup: So, $(window).on('resize', adjustStyle); $(window).on('load', adjustStyle); ?
[11:34:00] <petzup> yes, and if you get also parameter in function also define parameter
[11:34:37] <monstordh> petzup: I'm not the greatest at jQuery yet. What do you mean?
[11:35:28] <petzup> parseInt() what is that function?
[11:35:56] <monstordh> No clue. This is a copy & paste job :(
[11:36:03] <wheeei> just learning the basics with jquery... is Traversal always the way to go?
[11:37:21] <monstordh> petzup: I just tried: $(window).on('resize', adjustStyle()); $(window).on('load', adjustStyle());
[11:37:31] <arthurvr> wheeei: what do you mean with ”traversal”?
[11:37:36] <monstordh> petzup: It didn't work. Actually broke my site
[11:37:38] <arthurvr> wheeei: you mean the dom?
[11:37:48] <petzup> http://pastebin.com/PgXTdmGN
[11:37:53] <petzup> try something like that
[11:38:26] <petzup> sorry there should be $('.container').width(); or better $(window).width();
[11:38:52] <wheeei> arthurvr travsering, walking the dom instead of targeting right away. For example instead of $("#vacations li:last"); it's better(faster) to write: $("#vacations").find("li").last();
[11:39:09] <wheeei> traversing* can't spell the damn thing :D
[11:39:23] <arthurvr> wheeei: it’s the way to go
[11:39:23] <arthurvr> wheeei: when you need it :)
[11:39:42] <monstordh> petzup: That works for loading, but not resizing
[11:39:47] <wheeei> arthurvr if it's faster, that should always be the way to go... _
[11:39:49] <monstordh> petzup: ah.
[11:39:51] <arthurvr> wheeei: I mean, if you write your selectors good there’s no reason to do this kind of things
[11:39:53] <monstordh> petzup: Didn't see your followup
[11:40:05] <arthurvr> wheeei: depends on the situation
[11:40:40] <arthurvr> wheeei: sometimes just an id selector is faster, but in your example option 2 is the way to go
[11:41:00] <wheeei> arthurvr can you give an example when it would be faster/no difference?
[11:41:34] <arthurvr> wheeei: Think I’m going to redirect you to http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[11:42:18] <arthurvr> wheeei: also, if it involves attribute selectors, always go for traversing if that’s possible
[11:42:41] <arthurvr> wheeei: you need to get as much as possible selectors into qSA
[11:42:59] <wheeei> arthurvr okay, thanx! =) qSA?
[11:43:17] <arthurvr> querySelectorAll, it’s a native browser api
[11:43:28] <arthurvr> That’s faster than jQuery, it’s native :)
[11:43:57] <wheeei> arthurvr and the way to do that is writing good id's and classes on the html-code ?
[11:43:59] <petzup> mostordh it should also work for resize
[11:44:10] <monstordh> petzup: Yes! It does! Thank you!
[11:44:16] <petzup> :)
[11:44:21] <monstordh> petzup: Plus, that code makes more sense to me
[11:44:28] <phelix> Say I have to variables that have an int or the return of height() what is best way to compare the 2 variables and tell me which one has the greatest height?
[11:44:36] <arthurvr> wheeei: not specifically. The big deals are the star selector, attribute selectors, …
[11:45:04] <wheeei> arthurvr okay
[11:45:21] <petzup> phelix, var height1 = $('.elm1').height(); var height2 = $('.elm2').height(); if(height1 < height2) .... ?
[11:45:39] <monstordh> petzup: Thanks again!
[11:45:40] <phelix> ohh yah duh.. haha thank you
[11:49:05] <DarkGhost> if I do a $("#test").load(file);
[11:49:13] <DarkGhost> how can I then in the next line change a div id that is inside that file?
[11:49:55] <arthurvr> $(”#test”).find(”your selector”).doYourChangesHere()
[11:51:29] <cjohnson> DarkGhost: you can't, load is async. you have to do it in the callback for load
[11:51:32] <shoky> $("#test").load(file, function() { $(this).find(...) })
[11:51:32] <wheeei> arthurvr a quick example . $(”#test”).find(”li”); $("#test li"); does performance matter in this case?
[11:52:21] <arthurvr> DarkGhost: of course, should be in the callback
[11:52:42] <cjohnson> wheeei: negligible
[11:53:02] <cjohnson> optimize where it matters
[11:53:04] <arthurvr> wheeei: doesn’t matter much in this example. If you jsperf it you will see we’re talking about literally milliseconds. Don’t waste your time on this kind of selectors
[11:53:47] <wheeei> arthurvr okay, and it's no "best practice" so more experienced jQuery devs might frown upon one or the other?
[11:53:51] <arthurvr> wheeei: use that time to cache selectors, is more likely worth it.
[11:54:03] <arthurvr> wheeei: nope there isn’t
[11:54:15] <arthurvr> wheeei: don’t take me wrong. perf matters.
[11:54:29] <arthurvr> wheeei: but don’t waste your time on this kind of things.
[11:54:52] <wheeei> arthurvr alright, just don't wanna get into bad habits rather than anything else..
[11:55:14] <arthurvr> wheeei: understandable. Feel free to ask :-)
[11:55:34] <wheeei> think I will always use find() as I don't see any upsides to not use it :P
[11:56:03] <arthurvr> wheeei: feel free. There aren’t downsides to the other way too.
[11:56:16] <cjohnson> I switch off, depends on the code
[11:56:49] <cjohnson> If I want to do something like   .foo .bar a, .foo .bar b  I might prefer $('.foo .bar').find('a,b')
[11:57:05] <arthurvr> I just write them the most eye-parsable way.
[11:57:38] <arthurvr> the example from cjohnson is a perfect one.
[11:57:52] <cuppy> Is anyone familiar with flowtype.js? Is there a way to make sure text is resized before jQuery-based positioning fires? A huge $when().done() wrapper, maybe? Is that efficient?
[11:58:13] <monstordh> A moment ago petzup was helping me configure a script to switch style sheets based on browser width. It works fine on my desktop (changing screen sizes, etc.), but does not implement on my mobile device. Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/RfFanN1h Any suggestions as to what might be wrong?
[11:58:16] <cuppy> positioning/resizing//responsive design
[11:59:11] <DarkGhost> arthurvr is there an easier way to do then putting it in callback
[11:59:19] <DarkGhost> like what if I have a super long .click or something
[11:59:22] <DarkGhost> just put it in the call back?
[11:59:52] <arthurvr> $(‘select’).load(‘file.html’, function() { doStuff(); })
[11:59:56] <DarkGhost> yeah
[11:59:57] <DarkGhost> thats what I did
[11:59:58] <DarkGhost> okay
[11:59:59] <DarkGhost> thank you
[12:00:11] <rfish> I noticed my jquery touch punch is very slow in an iframe
[12:00:17] <rfish> anyone ever experience that?
[12:00:36] <cjohnson> you could just do $('select').load('file.html', doStuff);
[12:00:52] <arthurvr> rfish: sounds like a general perf issue. jsfiddle? jsbin?
[12:01:14] <arthurvr> cjohnson: With doStuff() I meant the stuff he wanted to do (which will probably be more than one function)
[12:01:30] <cjohnson> Oh I thought you were saying "move the long click handler into another function and call that"
[12:01:57] <Es0teric> ok so i am using the selectize jquery plugin and i am having an issue where its not displaying the results of the xhr request http://jsfiddle.net/0t37pmhm/2/
[12:02:05] <arthurvr> I don’t remember what you wanted to do in the callback, but it’s possible indeed
[12:07:50] <Es0teric> arthurvr: http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/ i have a list of tags that i want to populate in the view
[12:14:09] <wheeei> arthurvr watching 2 basic jQuery courses at once and now I got two ways to create p-node inside the dom. var testNode = $('<p>Test</p>'); and var nodeTest = $("<p>"); nodeTest.append("Testing"); Are both ways correct? Is any better than the other?
[12:14:55] <arthurvr> I personally prefer the first one, since it’s more clear. But that’s my personal opinion, the result of both snippets is the same
[12:17:49] <monstordh> Can anyone tell me why my script works fine on desktop, but doesn't work on mobile devices? http://pastebin.com/RfFanN1h
[12:18:21] <BillCriswell> monstordh: Why don't you use media queries instead?
[12:19:26] <monstordh> Because I need it to be responsive, not static
[12:19:42] <BillCriswell> media queries are as responsive as you can get.
[12:20:18] <monstordh> they will load style sheets responsively?
[12:20:29] <BillCriswell> monstordh: Yes.
[12:20:39] <BillCriswell> <link rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 700px)" src="css/mobile.css"> and <link rel="stylesheet" media="(min-width: 701px)" src="css/desktop.css">
[12:20:51] <BillCriswell> If you want to keep them separated like that.
[12:21:29] <BillCriswell> Thought just one stylesheet with the mediaqueries inside would be preferabble. Your call though, obviously.
[12:21:38] <monstordh> BillCriswell: I think that's what I was having trouble with: max-width. Is this the max capable width of the device? or the current viewport size?
[12:22:10] <BillCriswell> That would be viewport size, but you can use max-device-width or something.
[12:22:26] <monstordh> BillCriswell: Do you have any idea why my script isn't running on mobile devices?
[12:22:45] <monstordh> Shouldn't it be the same principle?
[12:23:35] <BillCriswell> monstordh: alert(width) and see what the phone is reporting. If it's reporting something that's not the width you probably need to set the meta viewport tag properly.
[12:23:58] <monstordh> gotcha
[12:24:01] <monstordh> I'll give it a shot
[12:24:04] <BillCriswell> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag is a good read on it.
[12:24:58] <monstordh> Thank you so much.
[12:25:17] <monstordh> Question - If I added the media queries to the html, would it conflict with my script if it was working?
[12:25:49] <Es0teric> this selectize thing is driving me insane...
[12:26:18] <BillCriswell> monstordh: It would be adding the same CSS twice.
[12:26:23] <BillCriswell> As far as I'm following.
[12:26:44] <monstordh> k - that's what I was wondering
[12:26:56] <monstordh> When I added the alert(), nothing pops up on my mobile device
[12:28:32] <monstordh> BillCriswell: it actually broke another script (slider)
[12:29:14] <BillCriswell> monstordh: If the alert isn't firing you have an error somewhere else.
[12:30:29] <monstordh> think I may have found it!
[12:30:35] <monstordh> missing semicolon!
[12:30:55] <monstordh> Well… the alert worked, but not the css swap :(
[12:31:18] <monstordh> oh
[12:31:19] <monstordh> wow
[12:31:21] <monstordh> I know why :)
[12:31:33] <Es0teric> alright i have this updated code: http://jsfiddle.net/0t37pmhm/3/
[12:31:48] <monstordh> BillCriswell: Because my phone's viewport size (although it looks very narrow) is 980
[12:32:09] <BillCriswell> monstordh: Because you didn't set the viewport tag.
[12:32:40] <monstordh> BillCriswell: First time for this. What's that? DOM element?
[12:32:43] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I think you want callback(res)
[12:32:56] <BillCriswell> monstordh: It's the link I sent you to that I said was a good read.
[12:33:02] <monstordh> very good
[12:33:08] <monstordh> I'll read up. Thanks for the help!
[12:33:13] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:33:15] <wovenhead> Hello all, I am experiencing an import conflict that is breaking some JQuery-UI functionality.
[12:33:29] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/0t37pmhm/6/ nothing
[12:33:36] <wovenhead> The library I import seems to overwrite my JQuery version and won't allow me to user the .tabs() method
[12:34:09] <wovenhead> the .tabs() method becomes undefined.
[12:34:21] <wovenhead> I have documented the problem here:
[12:34:22] <wovenhead> http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/131603/cartodb-torque-script-causing-jquery-ui-conflict
[12:34:28] <wovenhead> It is just an import problem.
[12:34:54] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Hard to tell without some real data coming in.
[12:35:25] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: if you look at the javascript area and the data object with json.stringify being called
[12:35:30] <Es0teric> thats what the data structur would look like
[12:35:34] <Es0teric> *structure
[12:35:46] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: That's the data you're sending to the server as far as I understand.
[12:35:47] <stangeland> is there a more efficient way to write this jquery snippet? http://paste.ubuntu.com/9923528/
[12:36:03] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Oh wait lol
[12:36:14] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: no thats the ajax data i am retrieving from the server because thats how jsfiddle handles ajax
[12:37:14] <BillCriswell> Yeah I just put two and two together.
[12:37:17] <Es0teric> lol
[12:38:13] <BillCriswell> The "Remote Source - Github" github example is set up how I was thinking: http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/
[12:39:04] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: i was thinking that too but then what would be the valueField, labelField, searchField /
[12:39:05] <Es0teric> ?
[12:40:04] <BillCriswell> I'd have to read the docs.
[12:40:12] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: i read the docs
[12:40:16] <Es0teric> theres no indication of them
[12:40:19] <Es0teric> if there is, its implied
[12:41:22] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/usage.md searchField and labelField and stuff is defined here.
[12:42:53] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: so then “valueField” would be id and searchField would be name/
[12:43:04] <Es0teric> i want to search by name but output the ID into the value of the select
[12:43:12] <Es0teric> i mean of the option
[12:47:41] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/0t37pmhm/7/
[12:48:38] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: hmmm strange
[12:48:45] <Es0teric> when the items are clicked they dont show there
[12:49:38] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Seems like an option somewhere.
[12:50:59] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: ah ok… instead of item its option under render
[12:51:19] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: but then how did you know that i needed those 3 extra params?
[12:51:34] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: searchField and all?
[12:52:13] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: yeah
[12:52:22] <BillCriswell> I just looked at the example.
[12:53:46] <lstude> Hi all! I'm attempting to get better at identifying JS patterns/different ways to write/DRY/refactor. In this example, I'm attempting to 1) Grab a URL on the page 2) Make a background image click to that URL. Would love to hear other approaches/refactor suggestions: http://codepen.io/lstude/pen/WbEjKw
[12:54:45] <robertLunch> $('body').append(window.codepen.defineClickableArea); - why are you doing this?
[12:55:13] <arthurvr> lstude: on line 8: var $url = $('.masthead-cta a').first().attr('href');
[12:55:28] <arthurvr> using attr as getter chooses the first element itself
[12:55:36] <arthurvr> so the .first() call doesn’t make sense
[12:55:57] <lstude> arthurvr i should clarify, sometimes there are more than 1 button on the page. i just want the first.
[12:56:04] <lstude> in my html in that example, there isn't
[12:56:14] <arthurvr> ya but .attr() calls .first() itself
[12:56:14] <robertmaxrees> lstude that's fine - .attr() only gets the first one.
[12:56:24] <arthurvr> `api attr
[12:56:24] <b-ot> arthurvr: .attr(): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[12:56:25] <lstude> robertmaxrees oh, who knew!
[12:56:31] <BillCriswell> lstude: What do you mean "make a background image click to that url"
[12:56:34] <lstude> everyone but me, apparently :)
[12:56:34] <arthurvr> seems like the api docs knew
[12:56:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:56:47] <robertmaxrees> lstude also, why the namespacing and all that?
[12:56:51] <robertmaxrees> why not wrap this in an IIFE?
[12:57:01] <arthurvr> ya was my concern too
[12:57:06] <lstude> robertmaxrees injecting via a 3rd party tool
[12:57:22] <robertmaxrees> not following - do you have to use the namespace?
[12:57:28] <robertmaxrees> or can you just inject it as an IIFE instead?
[12:58:01] <lstude> robertmaxrees yes to namespace
[12:58:10] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  okay.
[12:58:25] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: now i have an additional question — how do i make it escape characters?
[12:58:27] <robertmaxrees> also - this is a really roundabout way to do what you want.
[12:58:57] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I don't know.
[12:59:07] <lstude> robertmaxrees yes, i figured. im thinking there is definitely a way to streamline
[12:59:36] <lstude> as you can assess, i am fairly new to JS so still orienting around best refactor methods
[13:00:06] <arthurvr> lstude: with and iife we mean something like http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dPzRNx?editors=001
[13:01:01] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/khyvmbu/
[13:01:05] <robertmaxrees> this is functionally identical.
[13:01:13] <arthurvr> yes it is :-)
[13:01:17] <lstude> arthurvr cool. I am familiar with the syntax of IIFE but still don't really understand the use case. Googling further
[13:01:31] <robertmaxrees> lstude IIFEs give you a one-time-use scope.
[13:01:54] <robertmaxrees> that .append() call isn't doing what you think it is, so the IIFE will give you what you're looking for.
[13:02:31] <xqo> hi¨
[13:02:37] <arthurvr> hi xqo
[13:02:39] <lstude> robertmaxrees arthurvr can you namespace IIFE or does that negate the need to do so
[13:02:45] <robertmaxrees> negates it.
[13:02:53] <lstude> i see
[13:03:01] <xqo> is there a prettier way to do this? i dont like using 2 lines to set this variable's value https://bpaste.net/show/2b9bc9615d44
[13:03:05] <robertmaxrees> variables created within scopes only exist within that scope.
[13:03:09] <robertmaxrees> also - http://fixee.org/paste/khyvmbu/#url=jvg74fo
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> this is even closer to what you probably want.
[13:03:17] <arthurvr> lstude: it totally. It’s all about not touching the global scope.
[13:03:37] <BillCriswell> Yeah, touch that scope.
[13:03:41] <robertmaxrees> xqo if you need that var available outside of that function, you have to do it that way.
[13:03:58] <robertmaxrees> though you should avoid sharing vars accross scopes like that, especially if you're dealing with async operations.
[13:04:02] <xqo> ok thank you. I was hoping there was an alternative to $.get, that had a return value
[13:04:27] <terakilobyte> Noobish question. I've got a jquery function that fires when a button is clicked. The function collects up some data and makes an ajax post call. After the call it directs the user on using window.location
[13:04:30] <robertmaxrees> any code that relies on $.get() finishing should be in its callback.
[13:04:30] <arthurvr> xqo: that would break everything, as $.ajax (so $.get) is async
[13:04:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:04:50] <lstude> arthurvr does touching global scope increase margin for error while IIFE mitigates
[13:04:55] <BillCriswell> Just set a timeout.
[13:05:07] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to make robertmaxrees have a stroke.
[13:05:08] <robertmaxrees> lstude pretty much.
[13:05:10] <robertmaxrees> name collisions.
[13:05:13] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell hahahahaha
[13:05:14] <terakilobyte> The problem is (I think*) that the server doesn't have time to process the post and update my user model, which the receiving controller need in order to send the user to the correct page
[13:05:18] <arthurvr> lstude: kinda sorta yes
[13:05:38] <terakilobyte> is there a way I can force a wait until the save operation completes?
[13:05:41] <robertmaxrees> terakilobyte you have to do the window.location in the .done() or success of the ajax call.
[13:05:57] <terakilobyte> I was trying that but getting a weird error
[13:06:06] <robertmaxrees> show us your code
[13:06:13] <terakilobyte> moment
[13:06:26] <arthurvr> was just about to say the same. jsfiddle/bin ‘d be nice
[13:07:46] <reynierpm> hi how can I get among selectedChkObj.serialize() the values of each tr data-distribuidor in this code http://jsbin.com/yihusajuxi/1/edit?js,console,output ??
[13:08:38] <robertmaxrees> .map()
[13:09:05] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees could you write a example for me?
[13:09:12] <robertmaxrees> could you try first?
[13:09:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:09:20] <reynierpm> I have not idea how to
[13:09:24] <terakilobyte> https://gist.github.com/terakilobyte/ad31dca0b11d0ab20157
[13:09:36] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm start here: http://api.jquery.com/map/
[13:09:55] <terakilobyte> I'm trying something that feels super hacky atm with the timeout
[13:10:14] <robertmaxrees> terakilobyte what did you try that gave you the "weird error"?
[13:11:04] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, your'e doing it the hacky way :)
[13:11:09] <lstude> robertmaxrees and arthurvr TY for the assistance. looks much cleaner/more IIFE
[13:11:15] <terakilobyte> adding .done(function() { window.location = '/bonfires';}) to the ajax method
[13:11:20] <arthurvr> you’re welcome, lstude
[13:11:23] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it.
[13:11:26] <terakilobyte> I'll run it, it will work now that I'm asking for help
[13:11:54] <xqo> does line 8 not wait for line 7 to fetch the ajax json, and that is why i get undefined? https://bpaste.net/show/6f5d9cadd49c
[13:12:08] <robertmaxrees> xqo correct.
[13:12:14] <robertmaxrees> line 4 actually.
[13:12:25] <xqo> robertmaxrees what can I do?
[13:12:40] <robertmaxrees> put any code that relies on the $.get() call finishing it its callback.
[13:13:34] <xqo> put where? i didnt understand your wording
[13:13:53] <robertmaxrees> where you're setting thread currently.
[13:14:12] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/96867dc634b3
[13:14:13] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[13:14:57] <xqo> thank you
[13:15:31] <terakilobyte> @robertmaxrees so it's not giving me an error now, but I'm seeing the events happening out of order still in the log
[13:15:40] <terakilobyte> GET /bonfires/reverse-a-string 200 124.260 ms - 11667
[13:15:41] <terakilobyte> POST /completed-bonfire/ - - ms - -
[13:15:58] <robertmaxrees> terakilobyte dunno what the order is supposed to be - there's a lot of code here.
[13:16:51] <terakilobyte> I need it to send the post data and wait for that function to complete I think
[13:17:07] <robertmaxrees> that's what's happening now with completedBonfire
[13:17:19] <robertmaxrees> it waits for the ajax call to finish and then goes to the next page.
[13:21:01] <terakilobyte> ok, now it's not advancing, it looks like done isn't firing
[13:22:16] <robertmaxrees> check out your console - any errors?
[13:22:21] <robertmaxrees> network tab, too.
[13:24:26] <xqo> is this the same problem, where line 8 is not waiting? https://bpaste.net/show/2cca3fe3676b
[13:24:31] <xqo> nothing is added to $("#posts")
[13:24:37] <robertmaxrees> which one?
[13:25:06] <robertmaxrees> because you're using jquery's each method over a JSON object - not the right way to do that.
[13:25:23] <xqo> what is the right way?
[13:25:33] <terakilobyte> no no errors, my function in express says it completed fine
[13:25:34] <robertmaxrees> use a normal for...in
[13:25:50] <terakilobyte> https://gist.github.com/terakilobyte/ad31dca0b11d0ab20157 is the updated gist, bottom file is my edited jquery
[13:26:08] <terakilobyte> I'm using done incorrectly I'm guessing
[13:26:11] <xqo> I thought this was one of jquerys nifty more legible features..
[13:26:26] <robertmaxrees> xqo there's also $.each()
[13:26:41] <robertmaxrees> $.each(thread.posts, function(){});
[13:26:44] <xqo> thank you
[13:26:53] <robertmaxrees> though there's no reason to use it.
[13:27:23] <xqo> it is inferior to for...in?
[13:27:25] <robertmaxrees> terakilobyte that code should work.
[13:27:34] <robertmaxrees> xqo depends on how you define "inferior"
[13:27:50] <xqo> robertmaxrees why do you think for...in is a better choice?
[13:28:19] <robertmaxrees> because then I don't have to invoke any jquery at all.
[13:28:38] <xqo> why is not invoking jquery a good thing?
[13:28:54] <robertmaxrees> no overhead on detecting if it's an array or plain object, slightly faster, etc.
[13:28:54] <terakilobyte> getting this error in my developer console net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE
[13:29:00] <xqo> ok. thank you.
[13:29:28] <robertmaxrees> terakilobyte sounds like you're not getting a response back from the server
[13:30:00] <terakilobyte> POST /completed-bonfire/ - - ms - -
[13:30:00] <terakilobyte>   freecc:server undefined +5m Is completed with
[13:30:00] <terakilobyte>   freecc:server finished post +1ms
[13:30:02] <terakilobyte>   freecc:server Saving user +2ms
[13:30:04] <terakilobyte> on the server log
[13:30:10] <terakilobyte> the undefined there is expected
[13:30:12] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything to me.
[13:30:27] <robertmaxrees> also: please don't multiline paste into the channel.
[13:30:34] <terakilobyte> apologies
[13:30:37] <Duvdevan> > undefined
[13:31:02] <terakilobyte> that's a debug out, that part works when I define paired with
[13:32:27] <robertmaxrees> have you tried hitting that url directly?
[13:32:30] <robertmaxrees> outside of the ajax call?
[13:32:37] <Duvdevan> window = null;
[13:32:40] <Duvdevan> solves everythingggggg!
[13:34:34] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees I can´t get the theory behind .map I do not how to insert the data-distribuidor on the values I want to get/send to the backend
[13:34:48] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm link again
[13:34:53] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've tried
[13:35:10] <reynierpm> http://jsbin.com/yihusajuxi/1/edit?js,console,output
[13:35:18] <reynierpm> I did not try nothing just read the docs
[13:35:28] <robertmaxrees> then how do you expect to learn?
[13:35:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:35:31] <Shai-Tan> so, I get  Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function when I use  $('#userDataTable').dataTable();
[13:35:34] <Shai-Tan> why so?
[13:35:39] <reynierpm> well by seeing and example?
[13:35:46] <cjohnson> probably plugin not loaded Shai-Tan
[13:35:46] <robertmaxrees> becuase you haven't loaded dataTables, Shai-Tan
[13:36:01] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm you've been asking the same questions for a while and been getting spoonfed quite a bit.
[13:36:05] <Shai-Tan> hmm, the script is included..
[13:36:12] <robertmaxrees> abnd it's before your code?
[13:36:16] <Shai-Tan> yes
[13:36:21] <robertmaxrees> and jquery is loaded?
[13:36:36] <Duvdevan> calibraonline.combolchat.org
[13:36:38] <Duvdevan> good night
[13:36:45] <Shai-Tan> sec, will check the order in which things are loaded
[13:36:52] <cjohnson> if the selector returns nothing, is dataTable still undefined? I don't know how jQuery.fn usually works
[13:36:52] <dismist> shaitan: is jquery loaded, or loaded twice?
[13:36:59] <cjohnson> still defined*
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson it depends on the plugin.
[13:37:08] <robertmaxrees> some check, other's don't.
[13:37:45] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm first off, serilializeArray() is more often used with forms, not separate inputs.
[13:38:33] <Shai-Tan> yes, twas the order, thanks guys
[13:38:55] <robertmaxrees> second off, the docs show you an almost exact versyion of what you want to do.
[13:39:58] <robertmaxrees> reynierpmn http://jsbin.com/pariboquqa/1/edit?js,console,output
[13:40:02] <robertmaxrees> really trivial stuff here.
[13:41:46] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees that get the ID, thatś fine but the value I am trying to get is on the closest tr, see the HTML
[13:41:55] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:42:04] <robertmaxrees> what about the closest TR do you want?
[13:42:05] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees that value is what do not how to get
[13:42:08] <robertmaxrees> c'mon man...
[13:42:16] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot.
[13:42:27] <robertmaxrees> i showed you how to use map - go from there :)
[13:42:41] <reynierpm> ok let me try
[13:42:48] <xqo> line 8 which is $("#thread").append(someString) does not work, line 9 which is console.log(someString) does. how can i make line 8 work? https://bpaste.net/show/db164d872a39
[13:43:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your data, xqio
[13:43:52] <robertmaxrees> *xqo
[13:44:15] <robertmaxrees> and example of the JSON object that you're processign i mean.
[13:45:15] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees inside the .map, this is a jQuery object? I mean can I do this.closest(´tr´)?
[13:45:28] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm it's like any other jquery function.
[13:46:04] <xqo> robertmaxrees i dont know how else to show you: http://i.imgur.com/IYeiUvU.jpg
[13:46:09] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees I am trying to reach the value by doing this.closest(´tr´).data(´distribuidor´) but is not working
[13:46:42] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm right, because 'this' isn't a jquery object, like in any other jquery function.
[13:46:50] <robertmaxrees> xqo JSON.stringify(data); first thing in that get callback.
[13:47:02] <reynierpm> this is what I ask before :-\
[13:47:19] <robertmaxrees> it's the same with every other jquery function.
[13:48:47] <Duvdevan> JSON.stringify(window);
[13:49:57] <xqo> robertmaxrees same problem
[13:49:59] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees here, http://jsbin.com/yihusajuxi/1/edit?js,console,output just one more thing how to convert myId to int instead of string
[13:50:00] <reynierpm> ?
[13:50:29] <robertmaxrees> to a number? sure - wrap it in a parseInt() call.
[13:50:51] <robertmaxrees> xqo i ned to see the data...
[13:51:14] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees it works
[13:51:24] <robertmaxrees> parseInt(this.value, 10)
[13:51:27] <reynierpm> http://jsbin.com/yihusajuxi/1/edit?js,console,output
[13:51:36] <robertmaxrees> xqo console.log(JSON.stringify(data)) - then share the data her.
[13:51:38] <robertmaxrees> *here
[13:51:42] <robertmaxrees> in a paste.
[13:51:59] <reynierpm> thanks
[13:52:50] <xqo> robertmaxrees https://bpaste.net/show/4bccd8e28e7d
[13:55:40] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:56:04] <robertmaxrees> thought you'd pare the data down a bit first haha
[13:56:17] <bulldog> Hello. I am trying to add functionality to an event already implemented on a site (Im building a chrome plugin).
[13:57:01] <bulldog> To do this, I want to catch a keypress event, execute my own code, then execute the already implemented code. I got the basics working, but for some reason I am not getting a 'keypress' event when 'return' is pressed. Any ideas?
[13:57:11] <robertmaxrees> xqo is there any way you could provide a small example of your data?
[13:57:17] <robertmaxrees> with like 2 or 3 indexes in that array?
[14:00:04] <xqo> robertmaxrees how about this http://a.4cdn.org/lit/thread/6065692.json
[14:00:40] <robertmaxrees> perfect.
[14:01:55] <terakilobyte> robertmaxrees: thanks, I fixed it!
[14:02:03] <robertmaxrees> awesome - what was it.
[14:02:09] <terakilobyte> I was stupid and wasn't return a response
[14:02:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:02:21] <robertmaxrees> called it.
[14:02:24] <terakilobyte> I also changed it to a $.post() method instead of ajax
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> that's still ajax.
[14:02:45] <Duvdevan> is $.post based on $.ajax ?
[14:02:46] <terakilobyte> because really, it shhouldn't be async as the controller needs that data updated
[14:02:49] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:02:55] <robertmaxrees> terakilobyte that's still async.
[14:03:02] <robertmaxrees> $.post() uses ajax under the hood.
[14:03:06] <terakilobyte> oh it is? well, it appears to fire inthe right order
[14:03:06] <Duvdevan> good
[14:03:08] <robertmaxrees> so the async stuff is still there.
[14:03:11] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't.
[14:03:16] <lstude> hey y'all, me again. is there a way to get '.demo' to reference $this instead of '.element' --- $('.element').wrap('<div class="demo"></div>');
[14:03:16] <terakilobyte> I'm responding after I save the user
[14:03:18] <robertmaxrees> you'll have race conditions eventually.
[14:03:19] <Duvdevan> is $.ajax based on XMLHttpRequest?
[14:03:24] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:03:44] <robertmaxrees> terakilobyte don't rely on the ephemeral order.
[14:03:49] <Duvdevan> on what's XMLHttpRequest object based on?
[14:03:51] <robertmaxrees> you still need to be explicit.
[14:03:57] <robertmaxrees> Duvdevan are you trolling right now?
[14:04:04] <Duvdevan> little, sorry
[14:04:09] <Duvdevan> good night now
[14:04:12] <Duvdevan> I'm fleeing
[14:04:32] <terakilobyte> so really I should respond back with the updated user info from that route?
[14:05:01] <robertmaxrees> terakilobyte that part is "less" important than putting any logic that relies on the ajax call finishing in the done() or success callback.
[14:05:49] <terakilobyte> hmm, alright. Sorry to be so slow, new to development
[14:05:56] <robertmaxrees> xqo almost done - you had a lot of probklems here.
[14:06:48] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g21e0pwq/
[14:06:57] <robertmaxrees> if oyu don't need to worry about IE8, this'll work fine.
[14:07:11] <terakilobyte> so here's the general flow I had envisioned. The user completes a challenge, when they do a button is enabled that sends that post info. Express picks up the post and handles updating and saving the user
[14:07:20] <robertmaxrees> in the future, a less offensive sample dataset might be nice, xqo ;)
[14:07:32] <terakilobyte> when the user asks for a new challenge, the controller will look at the udpated data and determine the correct one to send them to
[14:07:49] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple stuff.
[14:07:57] <terakilobyte> have I gone about it the wrong way or is that sane?
[14:08:07] <xqo> thank you very much
[14:08:11] <robertmaxrees> you're headed in the right direction, terakilobyte
[14:09:31] <bulldog> no love for my question? :(
[14:09:52] <robertmaxrees> have a basic fiddle to demonstrate?
[14:09:58] * Velveeta makes out with bulldog's question in the corner and then sticks his head up and says "what?"
[14:10:05] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahaha
[14:10:06] <Shai-Tan> bulldog, sorr, struggling myself :(
[14:10:26] <robertmaxrees> i just got one of those no good "oh shit" emails"
[14:10:46] <Shai-Tan> there is a good "oh shit" email?
[14:10:56] <Velveeta> "oh shit, you just won the lottery, dawg!"
[14:11:03] <Velveeta> "....in nigeria" damnit, i guess not
[14:11:29] <Velveeta> love the name, btw, shai-tan
[14:11:40] <Shai-Tan> WoT :(
[14:11:46] <robertmaxrees> U WOT M8
[14:11:53] <Velveeta> my kid's actual name is rand al'thor lindsey :D
[14:12:09] <Shai-Tan> I never finished the series when jordan died
[14:12:18] <Shai-Tan> after 11 books I just got pissed
[14:12:28] <Velveeta> sandersson did a passable job, but i wished RJ could have finished the series...
[14:12:37] <BillCriswell> Is that short for "Satan"
[14:12:39] <Velveeta> if he hadn't split into 37 different storylines after book 6, he could have
[14:12:57] <Shai-Tan> BillCriswell, in some religions, yes
[14:13:04] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[14:13:06] <BillCriswell> I love satan.
[14:13:09] <Shai-Tan> yeah, it kind of lost its way
[14:13:21] <Velveeta> it finally started to come back together in 10-11
[14:13:41] <Velveeta> i bought the final book the day it came out, then barely touched it for like 2 or 3 years
[14:13:59] <Velveeta> i just made it a point to read it a few weeks ago, and finally wrapped it up last week or the week before
[14:14:08] <bulldog> Velveeta: sorry, lemme try to explain this better.
[14:14:25] <Velveeta> bulldog: i had to scroll back to see your question, but i think i get the gist of it
[14:14:35] <Velveeta> you're not receiving your keypress event on enter
[14:14:42] <Shai-Tan> but we digress..
[14:14:56] <Velveeta> have you tried any of the other key* events? keydown/keyup?
[14:14:59] <bulldog> Yep... I do get it for other keys, though.
[14:15:11] <Shai-Tan> Should jquery datatable append to the url ?
[14:15:21] <robertmaxrees> up to datatable.
[14:15:27] <Shai-Tan> I am calling an api, and it appends ?_142248
[14:15:44] <Velveeta> bulldog: check here also -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14518412/keypress-event-not-generated-in-chrome-on-enter-key
[14:15:58] <Velveeta> shai-tan: that sounds like a cachebuster
[14:16:13] <Shai-Tan> is that a good thing?
[14:16:22] <Velveeta> it makes sure you're not pulling stale data
[14:16:34] <Shai-Tan> ok, sounds fun
[14:16:39] <Velveeta> in case it's changed on the server, it's not pulling old stuff from your browser cache
[14:16:49] <Shai-Tan> yup
[14:16:50] <Shai-Tan> good
[14:16:56] <bulldog> Velveeta: Wow. Just found out keyup works for return. However, I need it working for keydown apparently.
[14:17:14] <Velveeta> bulldog: yeah, if you want to execute before keypress handlers on the page, i'd use keydown
[14:17:29] <Shai-Tan> now, when I am get the data for the datatable from the api, the datatable just hangs with "Loading"
[14:17:40] <Shai-Tan> there are only 2 records in the return
[14:19:39] <Shai-Tan> the data returned looks like http://pastie.org/9869421
[14:19:42] <Shai-Tan> just some json
[14:21:15] <bulldog> Velveeta: Yeah... the piece of code on the stackoverflow link does not work, but I think there is another reason for that. I need to use 'on' to wait for document to load.
[14:21:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not what .on() does.
[14:21:55] <Velveeta> bulldog: you need to use a document.ready wrapper to wait for the document to load
[14:22:24] <Velveeta> but yes, i would use the .on syntax also, just because i use it anywhere i'm doing event binding
[14:22:39] <Velveeta> i also use .trigger anywhere i'm dispatching events, vs just .click() or .whatever()
[14:22:48] <txt23> I am having really hard time with this. Can someone please help? 1. JSFiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/4UjVr/4/  2. Docs: http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/#mobile (Basically I want to have native dropdown kick in for Mobile Devices)
[14:23:17] <Velveeta> shai-tan: i don't see anything malformed in that off the top of my head, if you open your dev tools, are you getting an errors in the console?
[14:23:32] <robertmaxrees> or the network tab
[14:23:42] <Shai-Tan> none, thats why I ask
[14:23:44] <Shai-Tan> just odd
[14:24:04] <Velveeta> then you may need to start setting some breakpoints and seeing what's going on internally in datatables
[14:24:07] <Shai-Tan> just looking at number of columns returned -v- number of column headers
[14:26:33] <Velveeta> txt23: you're not calling the mobile function in that jsfiddle... are you in your regular code?
[14:27:11] <bulldog> Velveeta: Yeah, the document ready is wrapper, as all the elements I am matching are dynamically created. I have to do $(document).on('selector' function)
[14:27:43] <Velveeta> bulldog: ahhhh gotcha, then yes, you'd have to set it up that way so it's a delegated listener
[14:28:21] <bulldog> the document ready wrapper is useless** (what was that grammar?!)
[14:28:54] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[14:28:59] <robertmaxrees> document ready is very useful.
[14:29:15] <bulldog> robertmaxrees: useless in this case...
[14:29:40] <Velveeta> robertmaxrees: he's dynamic content, so it doesn't matter if he's waiting for doc ready, he has to set it up as a delegated listener
[14:30:08] <txt23> Velveeta: Problem is I dont know where to put that mobile function at.
[14:30:13] <robertmaxrees> oh i thought he was trying to say it's generally useless, not that it wasn't helping in this particular case.
[14:30:18] <Velveeta> aw gross, i was looking at that jsfiddle for the bootstrap select thing and i accidentally touched a mootools
[14:30:21] <Shai-Tan> So, this is the code I am using to load the datatable. Am I doing something creative/stupid/dangerous?  http://pastie.org/9869449
[14:30:33] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: ewwwww
[14:30:46] <Velveeta> txt23: i would think it goes in anytime after you initialize that select widget
[14:30:47] <Shai-Tan> The response is fine
[14:30:54] <Velveeta> but i've never actually used that widget, so i can't say for sure
[14:31:22] <Velveeta> judging by the structure of that function call though, that's what it appears, is that you first initialize it, and then do your if check right after and enable mobile mode if that clause passes
[14:32:09] <Velveeta> shai-tan: if you're trying to run that code as an IIFE inside your doc ready, i don't see the surrounding parens
[14:32:22] <Velveeta> it appears to just be an anonymous function that's uncallable
[14:32:55] <txt23> Velveeta: Something like this? http://pastebin.com/3UVXCqpg
[14:33:11] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta that's valid, if awkware.
[14:33:14] <robertmaxrees> *awkward
[14:33:25] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/mr4chdk/ is what that normally looks like.
[14:33:28] <Velveeta> txt23: something more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/4UjVr/5/
[14:33:33] <Shai-Tan> but, it is called, and the table created (without content). maybe I will put it up live
[14:33:55] <robertmaxrees> Shai-Tan same port, prototol, and domain?
[14:33:57] <robertmaxrees> no CORS errors?
[14:33:57] <Velveeta> robertmaxrees: ah yes, i didn't notice that was just the function expression moved down a line :)
[14:34:02] <bulldog> Velveeta: Could the reason that it is not triggered be that there are already other listeners attached?
[14:34:10] <Shai-Tan> robertmaxrees, yep
[14:34:24] <Velveeta> bulldog: only if one of those listeners is killing the event from bubbling, but the short answer to that would be yes
[14:34:26] <txt23> Velveeta: That worked. Thanks
[14:34:26] <Velveeta> though it's unlikely
[14:34:33] <Velveeta> txt23: awesome :)
[14:35:02] <bulldog> Velveeta: Is there a way to have my listener preceed all others, then execute the rest?
[14:35:34] <harty83> is it possible to delete nodes between two comments? Using an app that I don't have easy control over its dom and it is setting a bunch of <style /> sections along with some divs.
[14:35:36] <harty83> The divs I can snag no problem.  The other stuff I can't.  But they wrapped the whole thing in comments.  So could was wondering if I can somehow select everything between the two comments and remove.
[14:35:38] <Velveeta> bulldog: not if they're being bound via native js functions in the browser
[14:36:24] <robertmaxrees> harty83 not really?  sort of - there are plugins that should help with selecting comments.
[14:36:30] <Velveeta> if all attached listeners are going through jquery event listeners, technically you can hack the $.cache object to manipulate the event processing order, but it's very fragile and not recommended
[14:36:35] <robertmaxrees> which you could then use to get further along with your goal
[14:36:52] <harty83> okie doke; I'll check it out.  Thanks!
[14:37:23] <bulldog> Velveeta: Damn, I don't think they are all jquery event listeners.
[14:37:28] <Velveeta> probably not
[14:38:02] <Velveeta> and if they're just bound up using something like addEventListener, you can't muck with that order at all
[14:39:35] <maddtech> Can anyone point me in the direction of why my page in IE9 displays a "Message from webpage" error.
[14:42:22] <robertmaxrees> hard to know without seeing it.
[14:43:41] <Velveeta> have you checked the webpage for messages?
[14:45:43] <maddtech> It appears that it's an issue with JSON parsing.
[14:46:05] <maddtech> Something with cross domain since the source of the json is on https.
[14:46:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:47:13] <Velveeta> is it just a protocol switch, or is the domain itself different also?
[14:47:40] <Velveeta> maybe IE just doesn't like importing secure content into an unsecured page?
[14:48:03] <robertmaxrees> that, too.
[14:48:09] <maddtech> it's a subdomain that has an SSL.
[14:48:42] <Shai-Tan> so, to see what is (not) happening http://kirtan.fm/
[14:48:44] <tracker1> maddtech, there's a different object you need to xdomainrequest (added in ie8 or 9, that you need to use instead of xhr, which is what jquery uses by default)
[14:48:53] <Shai-Tan> click on the "View Users" link
[14:49:15] <robertmaxrees> tracker1 jquery should check for you and fill that gap in
[14:49:18] <tracker1> maddtech, https://github.com/MoonScript/jQuery-ajaxTransport-XDomainRequest
[14:49:27] <Shai-Tan> the data table is there, but no data in the body
[14:49:34] <tracker1> robertmaxrees, iirc they didn't want that extra complexity
[14:49:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:49:44] <robertmaxrees> that sounds wrong to me.
[14:50:17] <tracker1> only IE8-9 have the issue iirc, in ie10 they expanded xhr to include the cross domain bits
[14:50:24] <Shai-Tan> the data from the ajax call is seen here http://kirtan.fm/api/user
[14:50:25] <tracker1> you also need CORS headers on the foreign domain
[14:50:28] <robertmaxrees> jq 1.x is feature complete and supports IE8.  not sure which particular part you're talking about.
[14:50:39] <Shai-Tan> so, all the pieces are there, but not put together right I am guessing
[14:50:39] <maddtech> Thanks tracker1.
[14:51:39] <tracker1> robertmaxrees, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/xhr.js no XDomainRequest there..
[14:52:39] <tracker1> robertmaxrees, IE8-IE9 used a different object XDomainRequest for HTTP requests to foreign domains with CORS checks... other browsers just extended XmlHttpRequest for it... jQuery doesn't support XDomainRequest
[14:52:40] <Shai-Tan> Just sits there "Loading"
[14:52:59] <robertmaxrees> tracker1 i'm familiar with the distinction.  i could have sworn that 1.x supported it.
[14:53:17] <robertmaxrees> but rereading http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8283, you're right.
[14:54:11] <Shai-Tan> Velveeta, you were saying the ajax was never called. How is that so?
[14:56:26] <tracker1> robertmaxrees, I agree with you, it totally *should* be included... most of jquery's reason for existence was to shim the variance between browsers... it's a big hole imho.
[14:57:10] <robertmaxrees> i understand why it isn't.  rereading the various discussions on it remind me of the larger problems present.
[14:58:00] <tracker1> robertmaxrees, yeah, I remember the discussion... though been a while since I've looked into much of it.
[15:03:21] <Shai-Tan> will this code load the ajax data when #user_display is clicked? http://pastie.org/9869449 ?
[15:03:31] <Shai-Tan> well, i guess not, as it is not working
[15:03:51] <robertmaxrees> what was the page you had this up on?
[15:04:04] <Shai-Tan> http://kirtan.fm
[15:04:14] <Shai-Tan> click on the green "View Usesrs"
[15:04:46] <robertmaxrees> where is the relevant JS?
[15:05:04] <robertmaxrees> nvm i see it.
[15:05:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing that element on the page.
[15:06:03] <robertmaxrees> oh _ not -
[15:06:57] <Shai-Tan> userDataTable?
[15:07:04] <robertmaxrees> clicking on the "View Users" text specifically works the first time.  second time i get an error - DataTables warning: table id=userDataTable - Cannot reinitialise DataTable. For more information about this error, please see http://datatables.net/tn/3
[15:07:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd move that ID to the parent panel-footer element.
[15:09:10] <Shai-Tan> the userDataTable table to panel-footer?
[15:09:33] <robertmaxrees> the one you're binding the click event to.
[15:09:58] <robertmaxrees> user_display
[15:10:41] <Shai-Tan> so, <div class="panel-footer" id="user_display"> ?
[15:10:47] <robertmaxrees> but that's not what's causing your particular error.
[15:10:57] <robertmaxrees> that's just going to make it easier to cick on that thing to get it to load.
[15:13:33] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/AsXnGrD.png this is the error i'm seeing
[15:13:56] <Shai-Tan> is that when you toggle off?
[15:14:14] <robertmaxrees> that's when I click "View users" a second time.
[15:14:45] <Shai-Tan> yeah, have not got that far yet, its trying to load the data again
[15:15:03] <Shai-Tan> I need to get it loaded first
[15:15:08] <robertmaxrees> it IS loading.
[15:15:11] <robertmaxrees> the first time.
[15:15:18] <Shai-Tan> I am not seeing the data
[15:15:21] <robertmaxrees> ooooh/
[15:15:23] <robertmaxrees> derp derp derp.
[15:15:37] <Shai-Tan> it is showing the table heading/footer by no data
[15:15:56] <robertmaxrees> http://forteis.dev/api/user/?_=1422486939472
[15:16:01] <Shai-Tan> yes
[15:16:11] <robertmaxrees> that link doesn't work for me.
[15:16:29] <Shai-Tan> I get a bunch of json
[15:16:38] <robertmaxrees> I get "unable to connect"
[15:16:59] <Shai-Tan> oh... oc
[15:17:02] <Shai-Tan> sec, sorry
[15:18:02] <Shai-Tan> http://kirtan.fm/api/user/
[15:18:11] <Shai-Tan> modified to use the correct domain
[15:18:57] <robertmaxrees> "f is undefined"
[15:19:03] <robertmaxrees> make sure your data is formatted correctly.
[15:19:45] <Shai-Tan> f?
[15:19:53] <tracker1> usr_progress_beer_target looks good
[15:20:32] <robertmaxrees> Shai-Tan it's coming out of datatables itself - http://i.imgur.com/vhFMPVJ.png
[15:20:42] <robertmaxrees> that usually means you're feeding it something it doesn't like.
[15:21:10] <Shai-Tan> hmm
[15:21:20] <Shai-Tan> the json looks fine...
[15:21:32] <robertmaxrees> is the format correct for what datatables is expecting?
[15:22:15] <Shai-Tan> like, the number of fields?
[15:22:23] <robertmaxrees> proper names, nesting, etc.
[15:23:11] <Shai-Tan> all keys are underscored
[15:23:18] <Shai-Tan> so no "col name"
[15:23:25] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[15:23:31] <robertmaxrees> how do you tell datatables what goes where?
[15:24:57] <Shai-Tan> As I understand, it just takes the json data and each row is created. It has no idea of heading names.
[15:25:23] <Shai-Tan> just dumps the json as <tr><td>asdf</td></tr>
[15:25:29] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't seem right to m.
[15:25:31] <robertmaxrees> *me
[15:26:39] <Shai-Tan> http://www.datatables.net/examples/data_sources/ajax.html
[15:26:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah - it expects a particular format.
[15:27:50] <robertmaxrees> click the Ajax tab here -> http://www.datatables.net/examples/data_sources/ajax.html
[15:28:04] <robertmaxrees> see how there's a single object with a data property on it?
[15:29:07] <Shai-Tan> { "data": [["....
[15:29:13] <robertmaxrees> yep;
[15:29:35] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/kz8vb10/
[15:29:46] <robertmaxrees> try something like this - see if it doesn't get you further.
[15:30:12] <Shai-Tan> will hack it a little. thanks
[15:36:36] <freerod> For long jquery operations is there a way to yield the thread so I can update a JqueryUI ProgressBar other than resorting to $.each and queueing the $(this).op() with setTimeout?
[15:36:49] <freerod> In this case using $.each is much slower.
[15:38:22] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn;'t need to most of the time - have an example of what you're doing?
[15:38:43] <freerod> Yes I'll try to be terse.
[15:44:22] <Fall> I asked yesterday but never got a response, is there a known issue with jQuery 1.9.2 with Android 4.2 / Chrome? The errors I'm getting in errorception is no method fadeIn() / no method fadeOut(). Just wondering whether upgrading to 1.11.2 would help with this.
[15:44:49] <robertmaxrees> Fall should be easy enough to swap in 1.11.2 to check.
[15:45:20] <freerod> The reason I want to avoid calling $.each.   Attaching powerTip (jquery extension library) on many elements can be on order of 10 seconds for a huge document to process all elements if called $('.myclass').powerTip().  Because of the function overhead even just doing $('.myclass').each(function () { $(this).powerTip(); }); is much more costly.
[15:45:58] <robertmaxrees> freerod why not manually fire it instead?
[15:46:12] <tracker1> freerod, there's no real threads in javascript, the ui thread is blocked by JS in the browser, the only way around this is a web worker.
[15:46:36] <robertmaxrees> iirc webworkers aren't available in all browsers.
[15:46:42] <robertmaxrees> but you shouldn't need to init all of them on pageload.
[15:46:43] <freerod> robertmaxrees: could you link me to where I read more about what you mean?
[15:47:18] <robertmaxrees> stevenbenner.github.io/jquery-powertip/#list-of-options - the "manual"
[15:47:27] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to manually open/close them yourself.
[15:47:34] <robertmaxrees> and do some other wrangling.
[15:47:42] <robertmaxrees> but don't init a bunch of you don't need to.
[15:47:46] <freerod> I do manual event binding, yes.  already.  Saved lots of time.
[15:47:48] <robertmaxrees> how many total instances do you have?
[15:47:59] <tracker1> robertmaxrees, correct... should have added "Where Available (R)"
[15:48:01] <freerod> For this huge document 700k
[15:48:05] <freerod> :)
[15:48:05] <robertmaxrees> freerod holy shit.
[15:48:19] <robertmaxrees> do a single delegated listener and manually swap out the contents of the tooltip.
[15:48:24] <freerod> You may have given me an idea though.  Going to read source for a moment.  Will return.
[15:48:26] <tracker1> http://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers
[15:48:37] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i know the dude who wrote powertip haha
[15:49:17] <freerod> tracker1: I'd considered webworkers but don't know them well enough so went with setTimeout.  may be I should revisit.
[15:49:28] <robertmaxrees> what sort of browser support do you need?
[15:49:34] <tracker1> freerod, for what you're doing, don't think it will help
[15:49:45] <reynierpm> newbie, and kill myself :) question, what is the difference between declare $selectedIdsDist outside $(document).ready and inside it? See this http://jsbin.com/mukecopaxo/1/edit?js,output
[15:49:46] <robertmaxrees> this is a really extreme case.  why so many elements?
[15:49:57] <tracker1> 700k dom nodes in a page at once is excessive for most workloads
[15:49:57] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm scope.
[15:50:05] <freerod> robertmaxrees: latest version of major browsers is ok.
[15:50:17] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm the one inside the doc ready function is distinct from the one outside.
[15:50:59] <tracker1> freerod, is there something other than a single call to powerTip for each node.. that won't work for a webworker, I don't think... maybe you need a lighter tooltip plugin.
[15:51:26] <robertmaxrees> powertip is fairly lightweight.
[15:51:33] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter what he's doing at that scale, it's going to be slow.
[15:52:29] <tracker1> robertmaxrees, true... at that scale, should probably be doing something with a virtual-dom and doing selective renders..
[15:52:44] <robertmaxrees> on-demand selective renders into fragments.
[15:52:47] <tracker1> (react, flux, mercury, riotjs, etc)
[15:52:53] <robertmaxrees> nah
[15:52:57] <robertmaxrees> create a single tooltip instance and use that instead.
[15:53:18] <robertmaxrees> though i'd step back and say there's a design flaw at play here.
[15:53:29] <tracker1> robertmaxrees, agreed
[15:55:13] <Fall> robertmaxrees: not really the response to the question I was looking for - also we don't have any pre 4.4 devices in the office here lol
[15:55:23] <Fall> thank you, regardless
[16:00:16] <freerod> robertmaxrees, tracker1:  Thanks for the suggestions.  It got me thinking.  I think I can augment the library to make a lighter weight entrypoint. I'll give it a try.
[16:00:57] <robertmaxrees> no need to change anything, but ok.
[16:02:08] <guideX> anyone know of a great jquery menu library with slide open submenus? so you have parent items, and only one set of subitems open ?
[16:02:23] <guideX> so when you move to a new subitem, it slides open those subitems below the parent
[16:02:36] <guideX> and is "cooL"
[16:15:55] <Tagor> I'm using $('.button-xyz').hover() to attach a hover event to certain buttons. In my code I have another function that disables the hover for some buttons by removing the 'button-xyz' class. However this doesn't seem to work. Even though it removes the 'button-xyz' class it still triggers the hover event. Anyone who knows how to fix this?
[16:16:28] <robertmaxrees> it's binding to the object.
[16:16:35] <robertmaxrees> removing the class doesn't kill the object.
[16:16:51] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to use a delegated listener instead and add/remove just fine.
[16:37:42] <reynierpm> how do I delete a item in array by its value? take a look to this code http://jsbin.com/zuyerijipu/1/edit?js,console,output
[16:38:16] <reynierpm> I will have arrs as input and need 1, 3, 4 meaning I need to remove the ¨2¨ value and not the item on second position, how?
[16:39:44] <robertmaxrees> you have to find the index of that item and remove it by index.
[16:41:52] <reynierpm> thanks robertmaxrees go it now
[16:42:20] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees http://jsbin.com/zuyerijipu/1/edit?js,console,output an extra question, can I do this pos = arrs.indexOf(2) > -1 in Javascript?
[16:42:34] <reynierpm> or I need to define the pos value inside the conditional?
[16:42:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:43:06] <robertmaxrees> you should define it before and check it.
[16:43:13] <reynierpm> ok
[16:43:21] <robertmaxrees> otherwise ou end up calling the same code obver and over.
[16:44:10] <reynierpm> yes, in this case will happen but .indexOf(value) will be dynamic I still need to define somewhere?
[16:44:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:44:35] <robertmaxrees> do it as little as possible.
[16:44:48] <reynierpm> nevermind I am understand myself let me try
[16:52:25] <Shai-Tan> robertmaxrees, fixed the datatable issue, had to write a custom function to create the json, and not rely in PHP json_encode... who would have thought PHP would be shit ;)
[16:52:37] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[16:52:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd be careful there.
[16:53:01] <robertmaxrees> but OK
[16:53:12] <Shai-Tan> the custom function, or php being shit?
[16:53:24] <robertmaxrees> the custom function.
[16:53:50] <Shai-Tan> well, json_encode does not do the job
[16:54:01] <robertmaxrees> what was it doing incorrectly?
[16:54:30] <Shai-Tan> mostly it returns [{ instead of [[
[16:54:49] <robertmaxrees> then you were using the wrong object typ.
[16:54:51] <robertmaxrees> *type
[16:54:57] <robertmaxrees> that's not a fault of json_encode
[16:54:58] <Shai-Tan> array?
[16:55:09] <robertmaxrees> [{ is an array of object.
[16:55:11] <robertmaxrees> *objects.
[16:55:16] <robertmaxrees> [[ is an array of arrays
[16:56:18] <Shai-Tan> $result = $stmt->fetchAll( \PDO::FETCH_ASSOC );
[16:56:45] <robertmaxrees> no clue what that does, since i don't do PHP.
[16:56:53] <robertmaxrees> but JSON is a hard thing to get right.
[16:57:37] <Shai-Tan> well, it makes an associative array of results from the db
[16:57:54] <robertmaxrees> that may or may not be actually valid JSON :)
[16:57:59] <robertmaxrees> also, JS doesn't do associative arrays ;)
[16:58:09] <robertmaxrees> nor does JSON, because JSON isn't javascript.
[16:58:13] <Shai-Tan> no, so I had to be rid of the indexes also
[16:58:25] <robertmaxrees> s/because/also
[16:58:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:58:39] <Shai-Tan> the keys
[16:58:39] <robertmaxrees> there's no such thing as an associative array in JS.
[16:58:43] <robertmaxrees> there are objects.
[16:59:43] <Robdgreat> when I use json_encode to encode nested numeric arrays, it returns [[]]
[16:59:50] <Robdgreat> as it should
[16:59:53] <robertmaxrees> right - an array of arrays
[17:00:21] <Robdgreat> so yeah, you can't give it invalid input then blame the tool when it returns invalid output
[17:00:27] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> and don't resort to writing your own in the case of something like JSON.
[18:01:32] <DarkGhost> http://digitizor.com/2013/08/03/jquery-html-callback-function-using-promise/ is there a way to do this without using promise? bind or something?
[18:01:33] <DarkGhost> btw robertmaxrees thanks for help earlier, i got it lal figuredi to ut.
[18:01:43] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[18:02:33] <robertmaxrees> why can't you use promises here?
[18:04:18] <systemfault> wtf... .promise() on a jQuery object?
[18:04:33] <systemfault> But whyyyyy
[18:04:36] <robertmaxrees> that article makes no sense.
[18:04:42] <robertmaxrees> html isn't async.
[18:04:45] <systemfault> Exactly.
[18:04:48] <robertmaxrees> just put your code after it and you're fine.
[18:06:49] <Sanjeev> what the hell is promise() anyway? what's it for? some new jquery thingy?
[18:07:33] <robertmaxrees> ish.
[18:07:40] <robertmaxrees> been around for a while, based on javascript promises.
[18:07:58] <robertmaxrees> a different way to attach callbacks to things.
[18:08:26] <robertmaxrees> not helpful until you get to cases where you have, say 5 different ajax calls running at once and want to be able to do something when they're all don.
[18:08:29] <robertmaxrees> *done
[18:15:12] <tdelam> Hey fellas, I am looking for a jquery book, any recommendations? I like the tutorial style book where you actually build something.
[18:15:25] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com isn't exactly that, but it's a good start.
[18:15:30] <robertmaxrees> how familiar are you with javascript?
[18:16:21] <tdelam> robertmaxrees: intermediate, been coding for 16 yrs, back in the day we had a js class... dabbled and got along fine since but I want to take my jquery to the next level.
[18:16:51] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[18:17:39] <tdelam> learn.jquery.com is more of a reference I use often, I am looking for more of a hands-on style book. I like realworld examples and building something.
[18:17:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah i get that.
[18:17:54] <robertmaxrees> i can't think of anything offhand.
[18:18:07] <tdelam> Hmm
[18:18:19] <robertmaxrees> codecademy might have something?
[18:18:37] <tdelam> ah yea, they might.
[18:19:10] <robertmaxrees> part of the problem is going to be that thing schange enough that most books are really out of date.
[18:19:45] <tdelam> yea, for sure.
[18:25:06] <cryptopsy> can you please make my accordion fill its height, without breaking the centering or fixed width on the container? http://cpov.info
[18:25:30] <robertmaxrees> we're not going to do it for you.
[18:25:35] <robertmaxrees> for the umpteenth time.
[18:28:00] <Robdgreat> any bets on how long before that gets asked again?
[18:29:12] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand how we can phrase that any differently.
[18:31:01] <robertmaxrees> also that link might be NSFW to some folks.
[18:32:56] <looper989> easy just keep adding more text to accordion :)
[18:33:03] <cryptopsy> that's ... stupid
[18:33:17] <cryptopsy> add exactly enough words to have it fit the image... mmhmm
[18:33:21] <cryptopsy> neat hack!
[18:33:32] <looper989> :)
[18:33:32] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried, cryptopsy?
[18:33:34] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: and you don't know shit like you didn't know eysterday
[18:33:42] <robertmaxrees> excuse me?
[18:33:54] <cryptopsy> what have you tried? Me, just spent all day discover flex
[18:34:02] <cryptopsy> don't make it your problem if you don't give a damn
[18:34:08] <cryptopsy> because its waste of time, for both of us
[18:34:18] <robertmaxrees> i don't see how it's a waste of time.
[18:34:22] <robertmaxrees> teaching you to fish :)
[18:34:35] <cryptopsy> because you don't have a solution except what useless rambling you providede yesterday
[18:34:44] <cryptopsy> that's pretty much the definition of 'wasting'
[18:34:59] <cryptopsy> what time is it over there? Here, 4am
[18:36:10] <robertmaxrees> You're very obviously frustrated - i'm sorry to hear that.  i don't think it's fair to treat me that way though.
[18:37:05] <cryptopsy> the issues of frustration is completely outside of your control, since i'm facing a mountain of code, but you're just rambling and playing victim in IRC. those are two separate things, don't exalt yourself to the complexity of jqueryui
[18:37:25] <robertmaxrees> please stop insulting me.
[18:37:54] <cryptopsy> by gosh, can we have some concrete definiton of what an insult is, what NSFW is, what pg-13 means? I think i'm pg-13
[18:39:35] <looper989> cryptopsy: fix your css - div height is half screen
[18:39:47] <robertmaxrees> he's not in here any more.
[18:39:53] <looper989> :)
[18:40:12] <sacho_> love the royal we.
[18:43:03] * robertmaxrees shrugs
[18:46:56] <cuppy> Ooooh. #jquery carnage. Now there's a rarity.
[18:47:02] <robertmaxrees> haha
[20:33:07] <DarkGhost> hey guys, i want to simulate a way to click on an h1 and be able to edit that text.... kind of like click on it and it'll be an input box but html inside the input box like <br/> will evaluate?
[20:33:09] <DarkGhost> does that make sense?
[20:38:29] <Snerf> DarkGhost, you can do that with the html5 attribute contenteditable, but only works in html5 browsers
[20:38:43] <DarkGhost> hmm okay.
[20:38:55] <DarkGhost> well lets say i just use a textarea, what is the event handler that everytime they type in it. it will get called?
[20:38:58] <DarkGhost> .keypress?
[20:39:13] <Snerf> no need for it, if you use contenteditable
[20:39:25] <DarkGhost> i don't think im going to use contenteditable
[20:39:58] <Snerf> then you will need to make 2 different elements, like an input and the h1 tag
[20:40:44] <DarkGhost> yeah thats what I'm doing.. but my problem is like what if they want to put a <br/> in the "h1" tag (really they'll be puting in the input tag") but they don't know that
[20:40:46] <Snerf> thats why contenteditable is so nice
[20:41:05] <Snerf> ya, you need a textarea then that auto-expands
[20:41:15] <Snerf> have fun with that one :)
[20:41:28] <DarkGhost> haha
[20:45:26] <Snerf> I built an entire system around contenteditable, using expanding textareas just sucked, because you couldnt add color codes (a very simple example)
[20:45:26] <Snerf> or other hml tabs, like your <br>
[20:45:26] <Snerf> tags
[20:48:56] <treeprogram> Hi, I'm getting this error: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token c." Any ideas on how to fix it?
[20:51:23] <Snerf> paste code on what is generating the error, treeprogram
[20:51:54] <treeprogram> Snerf: it's proprietary right now, I can't
[20:54:26] <Snerf> treeprogram, is it json ?
[20:56:11] <Snerf> my guess is you have invalid json, just check it out
[21:06:30] <treeprogram> Snerf: the strange thing is that it works in another version of the program that I have running. The new version has unrelated changes. Thanks I'll check it out more
[22:32:15] <cuppy> I just wnat to thank you guys. I first came here not knowing a thing, and now I'm pretty comfortable. So thanks for that.

[23:36:07] <symfonius> hello. how do I detect any change in an input type=text box?
[23:42:57] <symfonius> I tried               $('#thing').bind('input', function() {                    but if I have one character, then backspace that character so it's empty - it doesn't fire when it's empty
[23:46:37] <Chulbul> $('#thing').on('input', function() {   }
[23:47:49] <Chulbul> $(document).on('input', '#thing', function(e) {  });
[23:48:02] <symfonius> either/or?
[23:48:41] <gtristan> anyone know about using google closure for minifying purposes on a project that uses jquery and various jquery based libraries ?
[23:48:51] <symfonius> using.... $('#thing').on('input', function() {   }....... same problem. the final backspace doesn't register
[23:49:04] <gtristan> i.e. how to set it up properly, is there some web page I can read up on that ?
[23:49:20] <Chulbul> try with document
[23:50:34] <Chulbul> its working in both cases, when I click backspace event gets fired .. whats your requirement?
[23:52:00] <symfonius> Chulbul: basically I want to embed a google map
[23:52:07] <symfonius> And the user can define the map
[23:52:28] <symfonius> But I only want it to be a google map, so I want to add some validation to ensure that the input always starts with https://www.google.com/maps/
[23:52:54] <symfonius> so if someone pastes www.bing.com/whatever...... I want it to raise a validation error
[23:53:23] <symfonius> https://www.google.com/maps/!818!779!whatevr!blah....... and so on, that would be fine
[23:54:47] <symfonius> with (document) it doesn't register the final backspace either
[23:55:55] <symfonius> it's just the final backspace though
[23:55:57] <symfonius> not all backspace
[23:56:01] <Chulbul> please  add your code on jsfiddle and share its link.
[23:56:46] <Chulbul> I tried it when last word is "a" and I clicked backspace and then event gets fired ..
[23:57:05] <symfonius> how do i use bootstrap on jsfiddle?
[23:58:11] <Chulbul> add this -> //maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/js/bootstrap.min.js
[23:58:43] <symfonius> actually even without bootstrap it still exhibits the problem
[23:58:44] <symfonius> http://jsfiddle.net/0ep6f4bw/
[23:58:52] <symfonius> type in "t" into the box, see how the alert is fired?
[23:58:55] <symfonius> then press backspace - no alert
