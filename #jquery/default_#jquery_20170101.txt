[13:22:09] <starlays> I'm using jquery ajax to post information to the server and on success the server is answering with a json witch has a variable and the value for it, something like { "var_name" : "value" }. How can I get the var name and the var value in jquery?
[13:23:31] <igcewieling> try JSON.parse() ?
[13:24:21] <starlays> response = { "var_name" : "value"}; response.var_name and response.value
[13:24:34] <starlays> igcewieling: hmm, I will take a look
[13:25:02] <starlays> igcewieling: thank you
[13:25:23] <igcewieling> starlays: if you specify the dataType as json, that conversion might happen automatically.  I don't recall for sure.
[13:25:37] <igcewieling> dataType as part of the post
[13:51:11] <quechon> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/qdMITd0DeXghXx2YKoQ9/ when i run this code the the list im looping through repeats itself again everytime i submit the form it is doing what i want but instead of just showing one list it is showing the previous list plus the updated one
[13:51:25] <quechon> how to fix that
[15:47:49] <dglambert> yo
[16:37:55] <qakhan> hi all, i am trying to use variable in selector but its not working.
[16:39:25] <qakhan> here is my code https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/10/
[17:22:36] <qakhan> i declare a variable when i click on table name (RCDT) and then i use variable as table id
[17:23:20] <qakhan>  i can get variable value outside of fuction but
[17:24:04] <qakhan> it seems variable value is not being used in table selector
[20:32:26] <adv_> http://www.designchemical.com/blog/index.php/jquery/live-text-search-function-using-jquery/ , how can i modify this to highlight the text found?
[21:20:54] <whomp> i have a set of check boxes, and i want to add a class to each of them, after a random delay, when it has been checked. how can i do this? i don't see how to do it with .addClass
[21:28:22] <whomp> the problem is finding the specific box that has just been checked, right? so i can't just do $('.cbox:checked')
[21:33:50] <shoky> whomp: add an event handler for the checkboxes 'change' event, in the handler you can do whatever you want like setTimeout to a random delay and then .addClass
[21:42:00] <whomp> shoky, yeah i now see that, thx. i didn't realize you could do $(e.target)
