[08:59:09] <cuci> hi guys! I'm stuck on a modal. I'm changing the  value of a hidden input on show, but I can't get it on submit. This is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/sx8v5akm/
[08:59:15] <cuci> Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

[10:27:27] <abortionist> is jqueryui somehow connected to jquery beside the dependency?
[10:29:12] <abortionist> is this the standard jquery ui thing or just some independent project?
[10:29:22] <Caspan> I seem to be getting an 'undefined is not a function' error when trying to use fixedtableheader
[10:29:47] <Caspan> i have included 1.11.2 Jquery in my header
[10:30:08] <Caspan> is fixedtableheader not built into the default code?
[10:30:28] <Caspan> do i have to load it separately?
[10:32:07] <Caspan> http://www.mustafaozcan.net/en/demo/fixedtableheader/jquery-fixedtableheader-demo-en.html
[10:32:47] <Caspan> i am using the example from there but they are using the min jquery i am using the full version of jquery
[10:36:51] <abortionist> is there a channel dedicated to jqueryui?
[10:37:14] <Caspan> NM looks like its a plugin not built into the default code
[10:44:18] <bonhoeffer> so odd, my first click works fine — but afterwards, nothing works . . . https://gist.github.com/tbbooher/022d6167641942c1b4d1
[10:45:18] <bonhoeffer> i would love a troubleshooting option
[10:57:57] <abortionist> bye for now
[11:19:36] <Technical_13> I have a table, with 2000 rows.  They are formatted like ```<tr><td>cell 1</td><td>cell 2</td><td>cell 3</td></tr>```, how do I get the .text() of td cell 3?  $( 'tr td:index("3")' ).text()?
[11:22:29] <Technical_13> 	$( 'tr' ).each( function() { 		var pageSize = $( this ).find( 'td:nth-of-type(3)' ).text(); 	} );?
[11:23:42] <Technical_13> :eq()?
[11:26:41] <andrewrota> @Technical_13 see http://jsfiddle.net/phyofaaq/
[11:28:56] <Technical_13> Oh, thanks. eq is 0 indexed.. Cool..
[11:34:14] <bonhoeffer> i’m at a near total loss — clicking the first time, everything worked well, https://gist.github.com/tbbooher/022d6167641942c1b4d1
[11:35:01] <bonhoeffer> or works well, _on the first click_ after that, no response from js — and no error indication other than TableManager::findTables() — no http requests are generated — it is like the js doesn’t exist
[11:49:49] <bonhoeffer> since i’m moving items around on the page, i think the trigger is going with it
[12:07:55] <d4rkr4i> How can I delay form 'submit' event till my specific deferred ajax request is resolved (performing in background)?
[12:08:25] <d4rkr4i> something like $.when(ajax_request, function(){ //continue with form submission event handlers })
[12:08:35] <systemfault> d4rkr4i: You can't, you need to prevent the default "submit" behavior
[12:08:58] <d4rkr4i> systemfault: by event.preventDefault() ?
[12:09:04] <systemfault> Yes
[12:09:22] <d4rkr4i> but how can I then ask it to continue with event when I have the guaranteed promise?
[12:10:01] <systemfault> d4rkr4i: Just do what you want in the success callback, can't you?
[12:11:03] <d4rkr4i> the event handlers are already in place in my JS.
[12:11:22] <d4rkr4i> I was looking for the way where I could signal that event to continue :(

[16:04:35] <Leo2014> Hello i need some help with validation - someone there who can help me ?
[16:06:46] <Leo2014> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f4312ed70c5b7403416a this is my validation for domain .. the thing is .. the domainname must be written without http:// at the start and without / at the end .. - this works now but the problem is that i cant write domains like this now: test.test-domain.de because of the "-" in the middle of the domain .. how can i make this ?? Someone knows that ?
[16:20:46] <Caspan> found scroll magic
[16:20:54] <Caspan> this plug in is awesome.,.,,
[17:53:27] <Nyoom> How can I select something like this? .profilePostList.secondaryContent.h3
[18:14:45] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm using select2 jquery plugin on a rails app where turbolinks is used for the JS
[18:15:30] <bl4ckdu5t> When page is visited from a link, it doesn't load up the select2
[18:15:51] <bl4ckdu5t> went through this issue https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/issues/1582 and decided to move it to the <head>
[18:16:17] <bl4ckdu5t> prior to then, I'd get an error that select2 is undefined within the console
[18:16:45] <bl4ckdu5t> now there's no more errors but the plugin still doesn't display when page is visited through a link
[18:18:23] <bl4ckdu5t> I think the script runs before the page is ready or so because after running $('select').select2(); in the console, it takes effect
[18:38:18] <bl4ckdu5t> How can I join two events like $(element).on('click','ready')
[18:38:39] <bl4ckdu5t> How can I join two events like $(element).on('click','onmouseover')
[18:49:07] <shoky_> .on('click mouseover',
[18:50:21] <bl4ckdu5t> ok thanks shoky. I was just reading on .bind() thinking it will have to do with binding events
[18:50:54] <shoky_> .bind is old.  .on is the new .bind
[18:52:07] <bl4ckdu5t> why the IRC pays than Google :) . I'm going for .on then
[18:52:40] <tw2113> shoky is just a spider bot on IRC
[18:52:49] <tw2113> re-count his legs
[18:53:51] * shoky_ eyes tw2113
[18:54:06] <tw2113> yes! my SEOs will go up
[18:54:44] <shoky_> lol

[20:02:46] <tw2113> and what is the error?
[20:04:25] <limbera> sorry
[20:04:29] <limbera> undefined is not a function
[20:06:17] <tw2113> from my quick googling, everyTime is from a plugin
[20:06:29] <limbera> oh wow thanks
[20:06:35] <limbera> i assumed it was part of jquery core
