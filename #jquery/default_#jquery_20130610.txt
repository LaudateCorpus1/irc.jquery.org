[00:01:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yea
[00:01:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: $tr.append($('<td>').text("Something")); here I am inserting content inside <td> so how to add title into <td> tag ?
[00:02:07] <Cork> $('<td>').text("Something").attr('title', 'tooltip') ?
[00:03:05] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks will try
[00:19:12] <henn1nk> Hello guys. Do you know a way to add a area level to google maps? to display a certain area radius :/
[00:33:50] <lenswipee> how to do rounded corners using jQuery on an <img>
[00:34:11] <Cork> lenswipee: through css
[00:34:33] <Cork> as in, put it in your css file
[00:34:50] <lenswipee> Cork: Can you recommened a place where I can get an ajax loader image that has rounded corners?
[00:35:04] <Cork> not really no
[00:35:20] <lenswipee> Cork: Saving an edited ajax loader.gif no longer makes it spin around :D
[00:35:51] <Cork> lenswipee: you would most likely have to use a static png file
[00:35:55] <Cork> and do the animation in js
[00:35:59] <lenswipee> Cork: I've read that rounded corners don't really work on IE using CSS
[00:36:03] <Cork> as gif doesn't have alpha
[00:36:39] <Cork> lenswipee: ya, you can mostly just forget about rounded corners for ie
[00:36:52] <Cork> or use svg+vml
[00:37:04] <lenswipee> Cork: hence the rounded corner image
[00:37:30] <lenswipee> Cork: the current loader in .gif
[00:37:31] <Cork> lenswipee: you can't make an animated image with rounded corner
[00:37:41] <lenswipee> *is
[00:37:43] <Cork> as gif doesn't have alpha
[00:37:52] <Cork> it only have transparency (on or off)
[00:37:57] <xavier23> Hiâ€¦â€¦.anyone know how to allow text to be selected in jQuery? like in a calendar, where you can select multiple dates
[00:38:01] <Cork> so you can't make it round
[00:38:07] <Cork> it becomes jagged
[00:38:56] <Cork> ?g jquery ui selectable
[00:38:57] <b-ot> Cork: Selectable | jQuery UI â†’ http://jqueryui.com/selectable/
[00:39:02] <Cork> xavier23: ^
[00:39:03] <lenswipee> Cork: So im after a rounded ajax loader in .png format?
[00:39:12] <Cork> lenswipee: you can't animate png
[00:39:26] <Cork> thats why i suggested to use svg and vml
[00:39:34] <Cork> ?g vml
[00:39:35] <b-ot> Cork: VML: Home â†’ https://www.vml.com/
[00:39:38] <Cork> ?g svg
[00:39:40] <b-ot> Cork: Scalable Vector Graphics - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia â†’ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics
[00:40:16] <Cork> it even scales for ever if it's done correctly
[00:40:18] <lenswipee> Cork: both or either?
[00:40:22] <Cork> both
[00:40:27] <Cork> older ie's doesn't support svg
[00:40:29] <Cork> they have vml
[00:40:41] <lenswipee> madness
[00:40:45] <Cork> (vml is the suggested standard that became svg)
[00:41:00] <xavier23> Cork: looks good, thanks a lot
[00:41:04] <Cork> ie was slow to incorporate svg
[00:41:05] <lenswipee> i think i'll go lie down now.

[00:42:04] <Cork> lenswipee: ^
[00:42:50] <lenswipee> too hard bro
[00:43:07] <lenswipee> what's the lowest ie that supports rounded corners in IE?
[00:43:09] <Cork> sounds more like you're too lazy ;P
[00:43:17] <Cork> ie10
[00:43:23] <lenswipee> Cork: what!
[00:43:38] <Cork> ie9 has some support but it's buggy
[00:43:49] <benjick_> Hello. Is it possible to ping a server with jQuery?
[00:43:52] <fabioportieri> lenswipee: you solved the issue of last time?
[00:44:05] <benjick_> ICMP ping that is
[00:44:08] <Cork> benjick_: you can ping your own server, but not others
[00:44:13] <Cork> benjick_: then no
[00:44:14] <lenswipee> what issue? remind me, fabioportieri ?
[00:44:41] <Cork> benjick_: javascript more or less only have http at it's disposal
[00:44:45] <benjick_> Cork: Okay, thank you :)
[00:44:58] <fabioportieri> lenswipee: something with a keydown event handler and keycode
[00:45:20] <lenswipee> fabioportieri: yes, thanks for asking.
[00:45:22] <anli_> Is it possible to create opaque elements that can be inserted with ckeditor? They should not be editable, but be, for instance, forms
[00:46:01] <lemonsparrow> https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5747125 pls help me with this
[00:46:18] <anli_> <td/>
[00:46:45] <anli_> for (i = 0
[00:46:47] <anli_> etc
[00:47:24] <Cork> anli_: you can to some degree through contentEditable="off"
[00:47:40] <Cork> not sure how well it works with ckeditor though
[00:47:47] <anli_> ok, that cool!
[00:47:57] <anli_> So if I add that attribute to an element, I "close" it?
[00:48:12] <lenswipee> Cork: FYI, see http://www.htmlremix.com/css/curved-corner-border-radius-cross-browser
[00:48:16] <Cork> you exclude it from the contentEditable yes
[00:48:30] <anli_> Its not a class, right?
[00:48:45] <Cork> it's an attribute
[00:48:49] <anli_> ok
[00:48:57] <Cork> lenswipee: ah, htc files
[00:49:09] <Cork> lenswipee: those are bolt on solutions
[00:49:17] <Cork> and they always cause bugs
[00:49:22] <lenswipee> Cork: bolt on? meaning?
[00:49:45] <Cork> it creates elements; adds vml; runs javascript to emulate features
[00:49:49] <lenswipee> "bolt on" never hard of that phrase
[00:49:59] <Cork> uses position absolute and things like that
[00:50:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how to sort that out https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5747125
[00:50:51] <Cork> lenswipee: a features that is artificially added to a product
[00:51:16] <lenswipee> Cork: or you have to do is  boder-radius: 10px
[00:51:26] <lenswipee> Cork: works in IE9
[00:51:28] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you have to wrap each word in a span
[00:51:49] <lemonsparrow> Cork: could u show the code pls
[00:51:53] <Cork> lenswipee: border-radious is the only way to do it natively
[00:52:05] <Cork> lenswipee: and ya it works in ie10, but not really in ie9
[00:52:22] <lenswipee> CorkL and ie9, just tested it
[00:52:40] <Cork> lenswipee: like i said, it exists, but it's buggy
[00:53:08] <lenswipee> mine is working
[00:54:17] <lenswipee> anyway, i'm going to have a lie down because i'm very tired
[00:54:24] <Cork> lemonsparrow: append($.map(productCodes.split(' '), function(txt) { return $('span').text(txt)[0]; }))
[00:54:27] <lenswipee> it's been a long day
[00:54:37] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks
[00:55:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ReferenceError: append is not defined
[00:56:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ya, think a bit and you should know where it belongs
[00:56:39] <Cork> all of it was a bit of psudo code
[00:58:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I gave $tr.append($('<td>').text($.map(campObj[i].productCodes.split(' '), function(txt) { return $('span').text(txt)[0]; }))); and got <td>[object HTMLSpanElement]</td>
[00:58:54] <Cork> you can't use text
[00:59:05] <Cork> text will force the element to be text
[00:59:09] <Cork> use html
[00:59:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[01:00:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: now <td></td> empty td is appearing $tr.append($('<td>').html($.map(campObj[i].productCodes.split(' '), function(txt) { return $('span').text(txt)[0]; })));
[01:01:41] <Cork> bah
[01:01:47] <boytoy> https://github.com/watusi/jquery.mobile.simultaneous-transitions is still needed for jQuery Mobile 1.3.1 right?
[01:02:06] <Cork> lemonsparrow: s/$('span')/$('<span')/
[01:02:09] <Cork> uh..
[01:02:16] <Cork> * $('<span>')
[01:03:24] <boytoy> Cork :)
[01:03:37] <boytoy> good 2 c u
[01:03:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: now it's coming as <td> <span>ABC, DEF</span> </td> inside a single span.. we need each element in a separate span so as to add different tooltip ryt ?
[01:04:08] <Cork> lemonsparrow: uh...
[01:04:09] <lemonsparrow> $tr.append($('<td>').html($.map(campObj[i].productCodes.split(' '), function(txt) {return $('<span>').text(txt)[0];  })));
[01:04:14] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ^^
[01:04:36] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you should be getting <td> <span>ABC,</span> <span>DEF</span> </td>
[01:05:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: what does console.log(campObj[i].productCodes.split(' ')) give you?
[01:05:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ReferenceError: campObj is not defined
[01:05:40] <lemonsparrow> Cork: it isnt global
[01:05:50] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you need to input it in the code
[01:05:51] <lemonsparrow> Cork: will clear cache and try again
[01:05:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[01:07:07] <Cork> hmm anyone know if it's possible to get flot to accept iso dates?
[01:07:22] <Cork> (instead of unix timestamps)
[01:08:27] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I get https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5747125#file-gistfile2-txt
[01:08:57] <Cork> ah, no space
[01:09:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: what do you want to do with the comma?
[01:10:10] <Cork> lemonsparrow: in other words it returns <td>ABC,DEF</td> not <td>ABC, DEF</td>
[01:10:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: you see in some cases it is ["OBE,RE"] and in some cases it is ["RE"].. in cases where there is mutiple values I want to display inside <td> OBE,RE only but both should have different tooltip containing their respective fullforms..
[01:10:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yeah
[01:11:02] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so you need to split on ',' instead if ' '
[01:11:04] <lemonsparrow> Cork: right now I do something like this https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5747125#file-gistfile1-js
[01:11:18] <Cork> though that also means you need to figure out what to do about the comma
[01:12:03] <lemonsparrow> Cork: now it's coming as <td> <span>OBE</span> <span>RE</span> </td>
[01:12:12] <Cork> yup
[01:12:14] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but I need comma also... cnt we have that ?
[01:12:26] * Cork points at the last line he wrote :)
[01:12:45] <jmmy> where's the html for the step function here: http://api.jquery.com/animate/ ?
[01:12:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: $tr.append($('<td>').html($.map(campObj[i].productCodes.split(','), function(txt) { return $('<span>').text(txt)[0]; })));
[01:13:09] <jmmy> can anyone give a quick explanation of jQuery.fx prototype object
[01:13:11] <Cork> jmmy: he html for?!?
[01:13:42] <Cork> lemonsparrow: "though that also means you need to figure out what to do about the comma"
[01:13:42] <jmmy> Cork, you know on the animate page, if you scroll down to Step Function, they have the script, but not the html
[01:14:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: we would propbably need to have a logic for it.. or use map api index...??
[01:14:52] <jmmy> When I read the Step Function section of api.jquery.com/animate I am lost, so where can I go back and read to get in the know how?
[01:15:04] <Cork> jmmy: what do you need the html for?
[01:15:14] <jmmy> Cork, yeah true, its just a li item
[01:15:39] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the problem is you want the comma as text, not a dom element
[01:15:45] <Cork> and that makes it a bit tricky
[01:16:17] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yeah.. I am not as great as you to crack it so easily :)
[01:18:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/NbMje/
[01:18:24] <lemonsparrow> Cork: we can pass index inside map function ryt
[01:19:15] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and please use runnable examples for questions not pastebins
[01:19:22] <Cork> (aka. jsfiddle, jsbin or similar)
[01:19:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[01:30:24] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks bro.. :)
[01:30:35] <Cork> np
[01:32:51] <lemonsparrow> Cork: to add tooltip I did this.. but doesnt work return '<span>'.attr('title', txt) + txt + '</span>';
[01:33:04] <Cork> won't work
[01:33:09] <Cork> you don't have a dom object
[01:33:42] <Cork> '<span title="' + txt + '">' + txt + '</span>'
[01:33:54] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[01:34:37] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks bro :)
[01:35:12] <krz> what is up with this bs
[01:35:15] <krz> $.get("subscriptions", function(data) { console.log(data); alert('asdf') })
[01:35:21] <krz> why am i not getting an alert?
[01:35:40] <Cork> most likely cause the request fails
[01:35:53] <krz> nah, i see a json object
[01:35:55] <krz> no error
[01:36:16] <Cork> $.get("subscriptions", function(data) { console.log(data); alert('asdf') }).fail(function() { alert('i failed'); })
[01:36:17] <krz> status 200
[01:36:35] <krz> yea it fails
[01:36:37] <krz> still bs
[01:36:44] <Cork> cross domain?
[01:36:45] <krz> why did it return a status code 200 then?
[01:36:58] <Cork> does the json parse?
[01:37:03] <krz> ya
[01:37:37] <Cork> for which?
[01:37:43] <Cork> cross or parse?
[01:38:59] <krz> sec
[01:39:56] <Cork> basically if the connection returns 200 but the ajax call fails, it means that the browser is either blocking you, or you have code errors
[01:42:45] <jmmy> Cork, do you use modernizr?
[01:42:58] <Cork> not normally no
[01:43:00] <Cork> why?
[01:43:09] <jmmy> just wondering, why don't you use it?
[01:43:43] <Cork> cause i don't see a need for it
[01:43:59] <jmmy> I thought everyone uses it now.  So how do you do things then?
[01:44:00] <krz> Cork: the json parses
[01:44:08] <krz> no cross domain
[01:44:11] <krz> all on local
[01:44:26] <Cork> krz: any output in the error console?
[01:44:36] <Cork> jmmy: just plane css
[01:44:38] <Cork> normally
[01:44:58] <jmmy> what about fonts, do you use @fontface?
[01:45:02] <sacho> jmmy, perhaps he doesn't care about older browsers.
[01:45:04] <Cork> no
[01:45:19] <jmmy> sacho, no he isn't using new features
[01:45:31] <Cork> i do, but when i do i write fallbacks
[01:45:41] <krz> damit
[01:45:49] <krz> data type returned is json
[01:45:55] <jmmy> Cork, cool, what features are you using?
[01:46:23] <Cork> jmmy: currently; flex, placeholder, and html validation
[01:46:41] <Cork> some of them i just support if it's there and nothing if it's not supported
[01:46:54] <Cork> placeholder and flex is have js fallbacks for
[01:47:03] <jmmy> I just use a plugin for html validation.
[01:47:27] <Cork> hmm correction, i use html input types; not validation
[01:47:41] <Cork> the url, numbers and so on
[01:48:00] <jmmy> I never heard of flex and placeholder
[01:48:03] <Cork> validation is a small js script i wrote years ago that i use
[01:48:11] <Cork> ?g mdn input placeholder
[01:48:12] <b-ot> Cork: :-moz-placeholder - CSS | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:-moz-placeholder
[01:48:23] <Cork> ?g mdn input placeholder form
[01:48:24] <b-ot> Cork: Forms in HTML - HTML | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Forms_in_HTML
[01:48:27] <Cork> bah
[01:48:57] <jmmy> and flex?
[01:49:12] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#attr-placeholder
[01:49:37] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes
[01:50:06] <jmmy> Cork, so you use mozilla mostly for your knowledge.  I've never used them yet
[01:50:11] <Cork> for svg i just serve vml for old ie
[01:50:26] <Cork> jmmy: well it is one of the most up to date sources you can use
[01:50:41] <Cork> (no matter if you code for them or not)
[01:50:50] <jmmy> and flex fallback?
[01:50:59] <Cork> there isn't really any
[01:51:05] <Cork> the closest you can get is tables
[01:51:24] <Cork> so for the places where i really need flex, i have to fallback to js emulating flex
[01:51:41] <Cork> for said reason i rarely use it though
[01:51:49] <jmmy> flex is future eh
[01:51:54] <Cork> ya
[01:52:02] <Cork> well it depends on ie like always
[01:52:11] <jmmy> yeah
[01:52:27] <Cork> ie10 supports it somewhat (but not correctly)
[01:52:47] <Cork> so it won't be usable until ie10 drops of the market
[01:53:19] <Cork> (without hacks at least)
[01:53:47] <jmmy> canvas?
[01:54:14] <Cork> haven't needed it yet
[01:54:31] <jmmy> So you just use images for fonts? I'm surprised you don't use @fontface
[01:54:39] <Cork> luckely, cause it would be a nightmare to support for legacy
[01:54:48] <jmmy> I dropped it cause it wasn't working on mobile, but with modernizr, I am thinking of using it again
[01:55:06] <Cork> jmmy: no i just use fonts that are guaranteed to exist on all platforms
[01:55:21] <Cork> and as i do that, i don't need fontface
[01:55:22] <jmmy> Cork, Yeah, thats basic fonts
[01:55:27] <Cork> yes
[01:55:54] <Cork> well you don't need modernizer to get it working
[01:55:54] <jmmy> Cork, hmm, you can give a website a custom look so easily by just add special fonts.  Easy to make money as a designer that way
[01:56:20] <Cork> today all browsers supports it
[01:56:30] <jmmy> Not mobile browsers
[01:56:34] <Cork> they do
[01:56:50] <jmmy> hmmm, maybe just my mobile doesn't cause I have a really old one.  HTC Magic
[01:56:52] <Cork> i have labbed with it, i just don't use it normally (as i don't need it)
[01:57:14] <Cork> i know 2.3+ supports it
[01:57:18] <Cork> haven't tested older
[01:57:29] <Cork> (and ya, i really don't care about android 2.1 and down)
[01:57:57] <Cork> especially for something as optional as a different font
[01:57:58] <jmmy> hmm, See if you use @fontface, and browser doesn't support it, it will fall back to default browser, but in that case you need to adjust the font-size
[01:58:34] <Cork> not really
[01:58:44] <Cork> as long as you don't use px for dimentions
[01:58:45] <jmmy> cause 40px for @fontface might look great but for the default font 40px might be way to big or too small
[01:59:05] <jmmy> hmm, yeah you might be correct, I should try that.
[01:59:15] <jmmy> Just us em or percents eh
[01:59:28] <Cork> and make sure that the fallback font is from the same font family
[02:00:02] <Cork> well i use rem with a separate css file for browsers that doesn't support it (they get the hacky em)
[02:00:24] <Cork> em is a real pain to get correct when elements is stacked
[02:00:26] <jmmy> No it won't be same family for sure, cause fonts at fontsquirrel and the like are they're own style mostly, I guess you find something similar usually
[02:00:55] <jmmy> their
[02:02:00] <jmmy> I made this site, and it looks so cheap and boring to me, how can I improve it? www.amzumortgages.ca
[02:02:51] <Cork> jmmy: make the margins standout a little from the content is a nice start
[02:03:03] <Cork> alsy you could try adding some shadows
[02:04:41] <jmmy> Cork, thx
[02:04:41] <jan_n> jmmy: when the slideshow stops, for some reason, the image humps down a bit.
[02:05:29] <jan_n> jmmy: and you could check the image quality, soom of the images are kinda blurry, and the perspective seem off on some.
[02:06:00] <jmmy> jan_n, thx
[02:06:00] <jan_n> jmmy: like this. http://www.amzumortgages.ca/img/slide-fam10.png
[02:06:04] <jan_n> vs http://www.amzumortgages.ca/Bad_Credit_Mortgage_Hamilton_Burlington.html
[02:06:49] <Cork> jmmy: i suspect it's cause of the display: block / display: none juggle the animation does
[02:06:56] <jmmy> the Aspect Ratio changes depending on browser window size
[02:07:20] <jmmy> its the default slider for twitter bootstrap
[02:07:28] <jan_n> well it should keep the correct ratio on photos.
[02:07:38] <Cork> jmmy: so when the previous element goes from display: block to display: none, the effect it does on the new section goes away and causes the jump
[02:09:00] <jan_n> jmmy: with the photos, try to just scale one aspect so the ratio remains correct.
[02:09:23] <jmmy> jan_n, thx
[02:09:50] <jmmy> How much do you think I was paid for that site?
[02:10:01] <jmmy> Images and text were supplied by customer
[02:17:19] <gry> i have a base tag in an html page, how do i set its href with jquery? $('base').href = 'http://foo.bar'; alert($('base').href); says undefined
[02:17:47] <jan_n> $('base').attr('href', 'foo');
[02:17:47] <jmmy> I never heard of base tag
[02:19:23] <Cork> jmmy: it's a way to set the base url
[02:19:49] <Cork> and everything referrers to it for relative urls
[02:20:01] <jmmy> Cork, cool, thx
[02:20:16] <Cork> it's quite rarely used now days
[02:20:35] <Cork> as it was invented for hand generated html files
[02:20:43] <jmmy> Cork, yeah, It's not really needed
[02:20:45] <Cork> and if you have a cms it normally means you don't want it
[02:21:51] <jmmy> Cork, do you use cms, which one?
[02:22:50] <Cork> jmmy: not really now days
[02:23:05] <Cork> i mainly use go and ror for server code
[02:23:18] <jmmy> never heard of em
[02:23:22] <Cork> though i use python from time to time
[02:23:25] <Cork> ?g golang

[02:23:37] <jmmy> Personally, none of my sites have been so long that I've had to consider a cms
[02:23:57] <Cork> the length normally doens't have to do with it
[02:24:04] <Cork> it is about who is going to manage it
[02:24:33] <jmmy> yeah tyrue
[02:38:24] <jq_> Hi everyone. could someone say how can I set Jquery cookie per page?
[02:42:05] <krz> Cork: you know what swrong with this: $.getJSON("subscriptions", function(data) { console.log(data); alert('asdf') }, 'json').fail(function() { alert('i failed'); })
[02:42:13] <krz> it works with $.getJSON("subscriptions.json", function(data) { console.log(data); alert('asdf') }, 'json').fail(function() { alert('i failed'); })
[02:42:32] <krz> how can i get it to work without needing to specify the extension, json?
[02:47:22] <shoky> krz:  why the 'json' ?
[02:48:33] <krz> otherwise it doesn't succeed
[02:48:46] <shoky> krz: getJSON doesn't have a dataType argument, that's wrong
[02:48:54] <krz> err
[02:48:57] <krz> $.get
[02:49:03] <krz> not $.getJSON. typo
[02:49:06] <shoky> o
[02:50:14] <shoky> krz: then it should work fine if the url is valid. jquery doesn't care if the .json is there or not, it's your server that cares most likely
[03:00:49] <henn1nk> i am using google maps api v3.. is there a way to change the radius of a google maps circe? this.circle.setRadius(number)
[03:00:58] <henn1nk> via an input field?
[03:01:03] <Lost123> hi i am trying to make this fiddle work http://jsfiddle.net/JVmAh/1/
[03:01:32] <Lost123> i want that, on click of a link the window location should change depending on the value of next input
[03:02:29] <krz> how do i replace 'cdn1' with 'cdn3'
[03:02:35] <krz> 1 can be anything from 1-5
[03:02:50] <krz> regexp?
[03:02:56] <matijsb> .replace
[03:02:59] <Cork> krz: sounds like the server makes a difference between the subscriptions and subscriptions.json
[03:03:14] <krz> matijsb: does replace accept regex?
[03:03:25] <matijsb> yes
[03:03:26] <matijsb> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[03:03:34] <Cork> krz: .replace(/[0-9]/, '1')
[03:03:51] <Cork> krz: * .replace(/[0-9]/, '3')
[03:05:03] <Cork> Lost123: don't use broken links, use <span> or <button> for actions
[03:05:23] <Cork> Lost123: there is no reason to abuse <a> links
[03:05:48] <Cork> <span tabstop="0" class="link"></span> would be the complete way to make a replacement
[03:06:05] <krz> ty Cork
[03:06:17] <Lost123> so i will be using click event for .link ?
[03:06:20] <Cork> Lost123: also you want nextAll not next, as next only looks at the sibling following directly
[03:06:34] <Cork> Lost123: the .link was just an example for styling
[03:06:56] <Cork> the class can be what ever you want, it's the <a href="#"> that you shouldn't use
[03:07:27] <Lost123> got it
[03:07:30] <Cork> opps sorry it's tabindex not tabstop
[03:08:07] <Cork> Lost123: http://jsfiddle.net/JVmAh/2/
[03:08:24] <Lost123> even with alert($(this).nextAll('input[name=method]').val()); i get undefined value, why is it so
[03:08:26] <Cork> oppps http://jsfiddle.net/JVmAh/3/
[03:08:31] <henn1nk> sorry, don't know how to get it run in fiddle: http://is.gd/88Fkfa
[03:09:05] <Cork> Lost123: wait, is the .tile-btn meant to be a sibling or a parent?
[03:09:12] <Lost123> parent
[03:09:16] <Cork> ?.find
[03:09:22] <Cork> `api find
[03:09:22] <b-ot> Cork: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[03:09:39] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/JVmAh/4/
[03:12:25] <Lost123> Cork: thanks a lot. works like a charm :)
[03:15:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I am done with the task... but it seems this can be reduced considerably from a no. of lines of code perspective.. http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/D2Dqt/ ??
[03:17:07] <Cork> lemonsparrow: why don't you just store the productAbbreviations in the opposite direction?
[03:17:12] <Cork> then you don't need the loop at all
[03:17:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork: u mean key as value.. vice versa ?
[03:17:50] <Cork> ya
[03:18:01] <Cork> and i see no point in the getValue function
[03:18:20] <lemonsparrow> Cork: well this is coming from server... as an object {A: "A", B: "B"} like that
[03:18:57] <Cork> and you have no control over what the server sends?
[03:20:13] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I mean... I dont deal with backend.. plus that data (map) is also being used else where.. I cant change it
[03:20:44] <Cork> ok, then you can do productAbbreviations[$.inArray(txt)]
[03:21:23] <Cork> ops
[03:21:29] <Cork> ok, then you can do productAbbreviations[$.inArray(txt, productAbbreviations)]
[03:21:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: productAbbreviationsisnt array
[03:21:40] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yeah
[03:22:09] <lemonsparrow> Cork: aah I am confused now
[03:22:26] <MindSpark> hi. I am using a jq plugin and would like to access some of its properties in the global namespace. Is this even possible?
[03:22:30] <lemonsparrow> Cork: could u put that into fiddle removing the unnecessary stuff that u feel isnt required
[03:23:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/D2Dqt/1/
[03:25:05] <lemonsparrow> Cork: getting undefined as tooltip
[03:25:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: something is missing
[03:26:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: in the console.. firebug productList[$.inArray("OBE", productAbbreviations)] returns undefined
[03:28:15] <Cork> lemonsparrow: can you add the missing data to the fiddle?
[03:28:34] <Cork> namely the missing array and object
[03:28:42] <Cork> (dones't have to be real data)
[03:28:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[03:29:01] <Cork> and preferably make it so the js actually runs
[03:29:11] <Cork> (the missing $tr variable)
[03:30:15] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/D2Dqt/2/
[03:30:33] <compact> hi, i have: http://jsfiddle.net/J9kxw/ any idea why it wont load the map?
[03:30:44] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and what about productAbbreviations?
[03:31:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: give me a min
[03:31:26] <Cork> compact: i answered you that like 5 hours ago
[03:31:40] <compact> scrolled up and wasnt there :\ sorry
[03:31:42] <compact> using webchat
[03:31:50] <Cork> compact: your using a text editor that tries to style the text input
[03:31:55] <Cork> resulting in broken code
[03:32:10] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/J9kxw/1/
[03:32:20] <Cork> and check your error console for errors next time
[03:34:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/D2Dqt/3/
[03:35:00] <shoky> henn1nk:  you need to do var self = this;  or proxy/bind that anonymous function so it gets the right 'this'
[03:35:00] <Cork> aha
[03:35:31] <henn1nk> shoky: im sorry, but how? :/

[03:36:24] <compact> thanks
[03:36:43] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/D2Dqt/4/
[03:36:56] <shoky> henn1nk: also i commented the listener above it because it caused an error and its just weird.
[03:38:02] <compact> cork, yours works, but cant find whats changed?
[03:38:55] <henn1nk> shoky: thanks! i tried to modify this. but how can i change the radius during entering an different area number? http://is.gd/P0PrSG
[03:40:20] <shoky> henn1nk: you have a syntax error now..Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ,
[03:41:46] <shoky> henn1nk:  also you can't .val() on a DOMElement
[03:42:08] <henn1nk> shoky: hmmm :/
[03:42:19] <shoky> henn1nk: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bGQ2f/9/   but you'll get nowhere if you dont know these things and are trying to modify a complex plugin
[03:42:50] <shoky> unless this is it ;P
[03:43:25] <henn1nk> shoky: thanks you soooo much!
[03:43:38] <shoky> yw
[03:43:47] <compact> ah found it cork,t hanks for your help
[03:44:11] <henn1nk> shoky: only one last thing.. is there a way to change the behaviour of the changed listener? so the area is refreshed during typing in for example?
[03:45:08] <shoky> henn1nk: use a different event instead of 'change'.  e.g. 'keyup'
[03:46:27] <henn1nk> shoky: thanks! :)
[03:49:43] <krz> getting some weird ass results with: html += '<div class="subscription" data-artist="{"id":'+value.featureable.id+', "slug":'+value.featureable.slug+'}">\n'; $('#subscription_list').append(html);
[03:50:24] <krz> this is how it looks in the markup: <div "slug":foo1}"="" id":295686,="" data-artist="{" class="subscription">
[03:50:25] <Cork> you haven't escaped your attribute content
[03:50:43] <krz> escaped {?
[03:50:45] <krz> or "
[03:50:45] <Cork> ?g mdn encode entity
[03:50:48] <Cork> both
[03:50:49] <b-ot> Cork: encodeURI - JavaScript | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI
[03:50:57] <Cork> hmm wrong
[03:52:19] <krz> like: html = '<div class="subscription" data-artist="\{\"id\":'+1+', \"slug\":'+1+'\}">zzz</div>\n'; $('#subscription_list').append(html)
[03:53:13] <Cork> '<div class="subscription" data-artist="' + JSON.encode({id:'1', "slug":'1'}) +">zzz</div>\n'
[03:53:32] <Cork> * '<div class="subscription" data-artist="' + JSON.stringify({id:'1', "slug":'1'}) +">zzz</div>\n'
[03:54:43] <Cork> krz: opps that would give the same error: '<div class="subscription" data-artist="' + escape(JSON.stringify({id:'1', "slug":'1'})) + '">zzz</div>\n'
[03:55:10] <krz> id doesn't need to be in quotes?
[03:55:24] <Cork> no in a javascript object
[03:55:31] <Cork> JSON.stringify solves that
[03:55:36] <_rgn> neither do
[03:56:01] <Cork> well ya, true, as data- doesn't validate fully to json
[03:56:13] <krz> it actually returns : <div data-artist="%7B%22id%22%3A%221%22%2C%22slug%22%3A%221%22%7D" class="subscription">zzz</div>
[03:56:19] <Cork> yup
[03:56:42] <_rgn> why don't you just do data-artist-id= data-artist-slug=
[03:57:27] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks it worked :)
[03:58:25] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the only thing I feel is that there should be some way to reduce lines of code for getKey method http://jsfiddle.net/D2Dqt/4/ so many braces.. I think we can use something called hasOwnProperty something like that ???
[03:59:04] <krz> so html = '<div class="subscription" data-artist="'+escape(JSON.stringify({id:foo, slug:bar}))+'">zzz</div>\n'; $('#subscription_list').append(html)
[03:59:11] <krz> still get some weird rendering
[03:59:15] <krz> foo and bar are variables
[04:00:06] <Cork> bah, damn... javascript doens't have a tool to do the escaping :/
[04:01:15] <_rgn> lemonsparrow: no you can't
[04:01:32] <lemonsparrow> raj: ok
[04:01:54] <krz> so how would i do it with variables?
[04:02:23] <Cork> krz: http://jsfiddle.net/G28dg/
[04:02:39] <Cork> or use &quot; instead of "
[04:03:01] <relix> hey guys, I'm using $(el).animate({top:0}, 1000) to make a div slide "upwards" (from a top of 120px)
[04:03:21] <relix> this works great in chrome and firefox, but in safari it's very stuttery (about 2 to 3 frames) and stops about 10px from the top
[04:03:32] <relix> until I mouse-over, then it "jumps" to top:0px
[04:03:43] <relix> it seems safari isn't rendering the last step
[04:03:52] <Cork> relix: try using css transision instead
[04:04:11] <Cork> it's gpu accelerated and normally performs much better
[04:04:12] <relix> Cork: yeah I probably will
[04:04:25] <relix> Cork: but I'd like to get to the bottom of this one specific problem in case I get it in the future as well
[04:04:33] <Eagles_2020> How to check my browser is JQuery compatible. I wrote my first JQuery now but its not working.
[04:04:44] <Eagles_2020> http://pastebin.com/nisqqEWn
[04:04:50] <Cork> Eagles_2020: does your browser support javascript?
[04:05:14] <Cork> Eagles_2020: is the jquery.js resource loaded?
[04:05:37] <Eagles_2020> Cork: i have enabled javascript and the resourse is also loaded
[04:05:53] <krz> Cork: thats a much cleaner solution. thanks
[04:05:53] <Cork> Eagles_2020: also don't use xhml inless you plan to serve it as souch, use <!doctype html>
[04:06:11] <Cork> inless==unless
[04:06:22] <fabioportieri> Eagles_2020: i would try display:none instead visibility:hidden
[04:06:50] <Cork> ah, ya, slidedown from full height wouldn't do anything
[04:06:52] <xec_> fabioportieri++
[04:07:15] <Cork> but actually .hide() not display: none;
[04:07:18] <_rgn> lemonsparrow:  but i do think you're doing something wrong if you have to look up object keys by values
[04:07:57] <Eagles_2020> fabioportieri: Great works now :)
[04:08:25] <fabioportieri> marvellous
[04:08:32] <krz> if i have a collection of json objects. what can i do to get the last one?
[04:08:44] <lemonsparrow> _rgn: yep its working
[04:08:49] <Cork> krz: do you have json, or javascript objects?
[04:08:53] <lemonsparrow> _rbut I thought those 3 4 braces made a  simple thing I am doing look so complicated :)
[04:08:59] <krz> json
[04:09:13] <Cork> krz: then you need to first parse it to a javascript object
[04:09:21] <Cork> var obj = JSON.parse(json)
[04:09:31] <Cork> (json is a string)
[04:10:17] <xec_> krz: by collection, do you mean array?
[04:10:42] <xec_> arr[arr.length-1] ?
[04:11:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how long have u been doing js and jquery ? :)

[04:13:21] <seutje> don't ask how we salvaged it
[04:13:25] <Cork> lemonsparrow: but i did write javascript when the only time to output things was document.write

[04:14:33] <Cork> not for the moment no
[04:14:39] <Cork> lol no

[04:15:28] <seutje> I've seen ppl listen in awe to somebody who had no idea wtf they were talking about
[04:15:48] <Cork> seutje: was that a hint? :D
[04:16:14] <seutje> yeah, as in "you don't even *need* to know ur shit and ppl will listen" :P
[04:16:48] <compact> any idea? ive defined the marker

[04:25:11] <compact> dam, thanks anyway
[04:55:19] <relix> hey guys
[04:55:34] <relix> why would my animate({top: 0}, 1000) get stuck in one of the last frames
[04:55:51] <relix> the top *is* set to 0 in the end, but it's rendered as if the top is 10px from the top
[04:56:10] <relix> when I resize, or hover, it suddenly rerenders and jumps to top:0
[04:56:14] <relix> this only happens in safari
[04:56:19] <Cork> sounds like a browser bug
[04:59:16] <relix> it's funny, when I have the element selected in the inspector, you can smoothly see the blue "highlight" box move up and down
[04:59:26] <relix> but the content is jumps in 2 steps, and then gets stuck 10px from the top
[04:59:38] <relix> well not funny, just sad
[05:03:01] <fabioportieri> relix: change position of your element to relative
[05:04:03] <relix> fabioportieri: it's already relative
[05:04:22] <fabioportieri> relix: dunno.. have you tried googling for similar issues on safari?
[05:04:33] <relix> fabioportieri: yeah, nothing shows up
[05:04:39] <relix> probably searching for the wrong thing

[05:31:40] <jop008> sit is this altena.touchingservices.nl user john pw john any idea?
[05:34:14] <JohnnyCache> question:
[05:35:02] <JohnnyCache> i pick an option from dropdown select by using .attr("selected",true) but it's not showing the selected option but the first one
[05:37:14] <JohnnyCache> oh got it !
[05:54:05] <ibc> hi, I'm locally testing a page (file:///) and the following jQuery 2.0.2 code produces an error:
[05:54:05] <ibc>   Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[05:54:05] <ibc> the jQuery code is just this:
[05:54:05] <ibc> jQuery("body").html(jQuery("body").html());
[05:54:05] <ibc> could I know why jQuery is trying to perform an AJAX request?
[05:55:10] <jmmy> anyone uses modernizr and can help me or point me to an appropriate channel?
[05:56:50] <seutje> ibc: .fn.html() strips out script tags and tries to fetch/execute them iirc
[05:57:55] <seutje> u could use innerHTML on the actual element if u want real content
[05:58:14] <ibc> hummm, but all the scripts and css are loaded locally, no http URLs at all in my HTML
[06:02:16] <seutje> ibc: odd o.O
[06:02:29] <seutje> ibc: what's it trying to fetch?
[06:02:53] <seutje> jmmy: I don't think it has a specific channel, but feel free to ask here or in #html5
[06:04:45] <ibc> honestly no idea yet :)  I'm just testing a JS code for searching text strings in the whole document and wrap them into a <span>. Do you suggest that if I run my web app in a real web server the JS above will try an AJAX request?
[06:06:48] <jop008> Any one created a login page on IE9?
[06:06:56] <jmmy> seutje, I am gonna post my code, can you check it out.  Whats fav channel for pastes?
[06:06:58] <jop008> my page is doing totally nothing
[06:08:40] <jmmy> This is what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/gNRkY/ And when I view source I am expecting to see the "no-js" replaced with a bunch of features but it doesn't
[06:08:51] <ibc> yep, I confirm the above code is performing HTTP requests...
[06:10:08] <ibc> and this is because my <body> contains <script> pointing to local files (non HTTP URI's) so they are fetched again and again... and the same script fecthing them so we have a funny loop :)
[06:10:53] <jmmy> seutje, ok I posted it to http://jsfiddle.net/gNRkY/
[06:18:39] <_rgn> jmmy: what are you expecting <script src="modernizr.custom.66276js" ></script> to load?
[06:20:21] <jmmy> _rgn, I'm not sure, that is actually what I am asking.  Do I have to call Modernizr somewhere else?
[06:20:42] <jmmy> btw I corrected the error there and added to missing "."
[06:21:14] <_rgn> do you understand what a script tag even does?
[06:21:24] <jmmy> _rgn, I am expecting to look at my source and see <html class="no-js"> replaced with <html class="js ...">
[06:21:42] <jmmy> _rgn, hmmm, I'm thinking based on your question that I have a major misunderstanding about it
[06:22:19] <_rgn> you're trying to load a script that doesn't exist (you'd notice that if you opened the javascript console)
[06:22:27] <jmmy> _rgn, As I understand it, the script tag will basically copy the contents of the file mentioned in src inside the <scripts></script> element
[06:22:51] <jmmy> _rgn, oh, I correct the spelling error, it does exist
[06:23:15] <_rgn> no it doesn't
[06:23:49] <jmmy> _rgn, what do you mean, it is there on my computer in the directory beside index.html
[06:24:23] <shoky> jmmy: also jsfiddle already puts a <html> and <body> tag around your html
[06:24:37] <_rgn> okay, i thought we were talking about that fiddle specifically and it doesn't load any modernizer resource
[06:24:49] <jmmy> shoky, I know, I just posted my code, I wasnt' using jsfiddle for testing the code, just for pasting
[06:24:57] <shoky> k
[06:25:37] <_rgn> don't use jsfiddle if there's no expectancy of it actually running
[06:25:57] <_rgn> it's very confusing
[06:26:23] <jmmy> _rgn, frig man...you are useless, thanks anyways
[06:26:55] <jmmy> I will paste on jsfiddle if I feel like, who are you telling me not to use it.  Do you own jsfiddle?  ...jackass
[06:27:39] <shoky> jmmy: works fine here http://jsbin.com/ekoroj/1/edit
[06:28:16] <seutje> jmmy: the reference youput on jsfiddle is relative to the path it's being run from, in this case http://jsfiddle.net/gNRkY/modernizr.custom.66276js, which doesn't exist
[06:28:28] <shoky> jmmy: relax dude.. you didn't make it clear that you're using it just as a pastebin
[06:29:37] <jmmy> seutje, yes, but the guy I was talking to, I mentioned I was just pasting the source there
[06:29:40] <seutje> jmmy: you don't need to add the no-js class, u can just target the regular things for the no-js functionality and target html.js for js stuffs
[06:30:08] <jmmy> seutje, hmm, the tutorial I am using says to do that.
[06:30:13] <jmmy> http://alistapart.com/article/taking-advantage-of-html5-and-css3-with-modernizr
[06:30:57] <vegangelica> hi, can someone help me out with something? this is my code http://pastebin.com/YKyn0sUg and my instructions are - Using the examples above, make it so your 'div' fades to 1 (100%) opacity when your mouse enters the 'div'. Make the animation speed 'fast'. (Make sure to give fadeTo() its inputs in orderâ€”speed, then opacity.)
[06:30:58] <seutje> jmmy: well, this works fine: http://jsbin.com/ekoroj/2/edit
[06:31:09] <jmmy> seutje, I saw it
[06:31:21] <jmmy> seutje, you can do view-source though
[06:31:30] <seutje> (I edited it, it's /2/ now)
[06:31:30] <vegangelica> this being the example http://pastebin.com/duZaKxsQ
[06:31:38] <fabioportieri> vegangelica: why don't you do your homework?
[06:32:01] <vegangelica> i am, i just don't understand what i'm doing wrong
[06:32:10] <seutje> jmmy: generally, you don't need to worry about browsers with JS disabled nowadays
[06:32:13] <vegangelica> i've set the opacity to one and quoted it for fast
[06:32:16] <jmmy> seutje, hmm, ok I am gonna try the cdn one and see if thats the issue here
[06:32:27] <jmmy> seutje, yeah, I figured as much
[06:32:38] <seutje> jmmy: oh, so the problem is that your custom one doesn't swap the class?
[06:33:03] <jmmy> seutje, well, I am using that as my criterion for it working here
[06:33:20] <shoky> jmmy: i hope you're not doing view-source to check that..
[06:33:21] <jmmy> seutje, I am thinking if it does that then its working otherwise its not working
[06:33:30] <seutje> jmmy: well the example you initially posted had a really weird filename
[06:33:45] <seutje> modernizr.custom.66276js
[06:33:54] <seutje> sure that shouldn't be modernizr.custom.66276.js?
[06:33:59] <vegangelica> so could you please advise?
[06:34:03] <jmmy> seutje, when you goto download page it creates it like that. I forgot the period before the js, but I corrected that already
[06:34:17] <seutje> oh ok, figured as much, just making sure
[06:34:56] <fabioportieri> vegangelica: you should use some specific selector, $('div).mouseenter(function() { $('div'),,, }); doesn't cut it
[06:35:23] <jmmy> seutje, same thing, with cdn version
[06:35:49] <shoky> jmmy: how are you checking it?
[06:36:12] <jmmy> http://pastebin.com/YDmZ0jt1 The Chrome console says modernizr not defined
[06:36:32] <jmmy> shoky, and when I view the source I am not seeing class="no-js" being replaced
[06:36:42] <shoky> jmmy: view-source shows you the original source.
[06:36:58] <shoky> jmmy: you want to inspect the live DOM in your browser's devtools
[06:37:06] <seutje> vegangelica: like this? http://pastebin.com/2AainpQv
[06:37:23] <jmmy> shoky, what you mean, you can show me some techniques?
[06:37:40] <seutje> jmmy: u should consider putting modernizr first, before jQuery
[06:37:43] <shoky> jmmy: right-click an element and "Inspect element"
[06:37:54] <seutje> (while ur at it, might wanna move jquery to the bottom of the body)
[06:38:02] <shoky> jmmy: or go to the elements view in chrome devtools
[06:38:23] <jedimind> or firebug in firefox
[06:38:36] <seutje> FF has native inspector nowadays!
[06:38:42] <seutje> it has 3D view, so useful!
[06:38:58] <jmmy> Actually, I am not getting any errors.  I had a commented //alert(modernizr); line in my jscript.js that was causing the error, but I deleted.  So now, can't I expect to see class="no-js" being replaced by modernizr?
[06:39:36] <shoky> jmmy: if you look in the right place...
[06:39:50] <vegangelica> seutje:. i think i'd want div to be 'this' though
[06:39:51] <seutje> jmmy: Modernizr uses a capital M, doesn't it?
[06:40:02] <vegangelica> it's the only element i have
[06:40:05] <seutje> vegangelica: sorry?
[06:40:25] <seutje> vegangelica: oh, yeah sure, but it's silly to re-query the dom when u already have a reference to the right element at hand
[06:40:48] <seutje> other than that, I don't rly see the point of the exercise
[06:40:53] <jmmy> Oh I see, it won't just be there when I do view source
[06:41:14] <seutje> you could change mouseenter to .on('mouseenter', 'div' on the body or something, guess that would be a lil more efficient
[06:41:41] <seutje> but that's just ant-fucking or however u call that in english
[06:41:41] <jmmy> I think its working cause I put the css at the link seutje made for me, and I don't see the error message
[06:41:51] <shoky> jmmy: you dont need to guess. i told you how you can see..
[06:42:07] <vegangelica> i guess i just don't understand why it's not taking my code. i thought i did it properly
[06:42:19] <seutje> vegangelica: is the console telling you anything?
[06:42:39] <jmmy> shoky, you said if you look in the right place, but then you didn't tell me where
[06:42:41] <vegangelica> Oops, try again! It looks like you didn't set your div's opacity to 1. Check the example to in the instructions if you need help!
[06:42:44] <_rgn> inspect element: ctrl(cmd on mac)-shift-c
[06:42:46] <shoky> vegangelica: $(document).ready(function ())   that's wrong
[06:42:56] <shoky> vegangelica:  you have an extra ) there closing the .read(
[06:42:58] <shoky> .ready(
[06:43:07] <jmmy> Yep its working based on the technique shown by seutje
[06:43:12] <seutje> oh yeah, didn't even see that
[06:43:18] <seutje> nice catch shoky
[06:43:27] <seutje> shit happens when the coffee machine breaks on a monday...
[06:43:33] <shoky> ;p
[06:43:34] <jedimind> RIOTS
[06:43:53] <jmmy> shoky, .ready( -was the for me?
[06:43:58] <seutje> well, the espresso machine broke, the regular old filter-coffee machine is still somewhat operational :P
[06:44:02] <shoky> jmmy: nope
[06:44:17] <shoky> jmmy:  i told you where, before already...
[06:44:19] <vegangelica> Thanks shoky!!
[06:44:30] <shoky> jmmy:   <shoky> jmmy: you want to inspect the live DOM in your browser's devtools  <shoky> jmmy: right-click an element and "Inspect element"   <shoky> jmmy: or go to the elements view in chrome devtools
[06:44:33] <fabioportieri> jesus i went to the coffee machine this morning and 5 minutes ago, still without sugar

[06:44:59] <jmmy> shoky, thank you very much for re-iterating :)
[06:45:04] <seutje> I'd suggest that talk for anyone ^
[06:45:27] <fabioportieri> the red haired guy is ajpiano?
[06:45:56] <seutje> I believe he prefers "radiant"
[06:45:57] <shoky> yep
[06:46:06] <seutje> or "lush", even
[06:46:07] <jmmy> haha, yeah there it is.  When you do view source you see the original class="no-js" but when you click "inspect element" you see all the other stuff.  Sweet.  THanks again Shoky
[06:46:55] <fabioportieri> cool
[06:47:01] <seutje> jmmy: that vimeo link up there is a lovely talk on debugging jQuery code in various browsers
[06:47:07] <seutje> in fact, I'ma watch it again!
[06:47:09] <jmmy> Thanks so much guys.  You guys are the best.  Thanks Shoky and seutje!
[06:47:32] <jmmy> ok I watching with you too then
[06:47:50] <shoky> fine me too
[06:48:11] <seutje> lol
[06:48:31] <jmmy> needs hair cut.  I get over it, we were all babies once.
[06:52:43] <seutje> jmmy: I beg to differ
[06:53:21] <jmmy> seutje, hehe, yeah he's looks cool
[06:53:31] <jmmy> I got a buzz cut
[06:56:26] <jmmy> Yep, modernizr object is spelled with capital Modernizr

[07:30:40] <fabioportieri> what's the meaning of "for pete's sake" catchphrase, who is pete?
[07:31:30] <sacho> google is a more appropriate target for that question.
[07:33:42] <fabioportieri> i thought it was an internal joke of this chan
[07:33:52] <fabioportieri> "Why Pete? Most likely it is a reference to the catholic Saint Peter.   Read more: http://www.joe-ks.com/phrases/phrasesF.htm#ixzz2Vp9L3ja2"
[07:34:27] <shoky> it sounds less offensive than for god's sake  or for christ's sake
[07:34:41] <shoky> to some
[07:39:20] <fabioportieri> i'm not offended if the name of the lord is invoked
[07:43:57] <shoky> good
[07:45:01] <fabioportieri> actually i enjoy it
[07:45:07] <jonkri> i've been googling on a convenient way to put a simple instagram widget on a (jquery) web site, but the things i've found either doesn't work or requires a client_id. is there anything you can recommend? :>

[07:50:06] <AeroNotix> hi - upgrading to 1.9.1, what's the replacement for $.browser?
[07:52:41] <NoiseEee> AeroNotix: its gone from 2.0, not 1.9.x
[07:54:45] <AeroNotix> sorry, 1.10.1 is what I am using, $.browser gives undefined. :)
[07:55:09] <AeroNotix> man I hate web development
[07:56:22] <kzurawel> AeroNotix: What are you using $.browser for?
[07:56:57] <NoiseEee> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/ @ AeroNotix
[07:57:17] <AeroNotix> kzurawel: getting mouse button states
[07:57:37] <AeroNotix> NoiseEee: read it, am using the jquery-migrate plugin now. But it feels like a hack anyway
[07:57:52] <NoiseEee> AeroNotix: not as much of a hack as using $.browser in the first place ;)
[07:57:54] <AeroNotix> kzurawel: mouse button state is completely broken between all browsers
[07:58:16] <AeroNotix> NoiseEee: get me the mouse button states accurately without detecting the browser and I'll stop using it clever man
[07:58:38] <NoiseEee> AeroNotix: google "jquery mouse button states" have a nice day.
[07:58:41] <pachet_> hinging web programming on mouse state is an antipattern
[07:58:45] <AeroNotix> Oh! Like I didn't think of that
[07:59:04] <AeroNotix> pachet_: lol wat, putting "anti-pattern" in front of something you can't find an answer to on google isn't correct.
[07:59:09] <kzurawel> AeroNotix: I think what everyone is trying to say is that that kind of code is always going to be brittle.
[07:59:18] <AeroNotix> of course it is, I am not saying it isn't.
[07:59:31] <AeroNotix> Please don't treat me like a day1 programmer.
[07:59:37] <AeroNotix> I know the reasons to not use $.browser
[08:00:24] <kzurawel> AeroNotix: Right, I figured you did. You're probably better off writing your own user-agent scraper in that case. That way you can tailor it more specifically to your code needs
[08:00:48] <kzurawel> AeroNotix: (plus you can write code to handle mobile / touchscreen, which is a whole other bag of hurt)
[08:01:00] <pachet_> AeroNotix: isnt correct?
[08:01:03] <AeroNotix> kzurawel: I'll just use jquery-migrate, it seems to work ok by just monkey-patching the functions back in
[08:01:13] <AeroNotix> pachet_: isn't what correct?
[08:01:24] <pachet_> AeroNotix: that's what i'm asking you
[08:01:45] <AeroNotix> pachet_: go write me drag and drop kind of functionality WITHOUT looking at mouse states, "anti-pattern"
[08:02:19] <pachet_> ok, just a second
[08:02:26] <AeroNotix> (it's not quite drag and drop but it's similar in concept, I just mention d+d since)
[08:02:44] <dcherman> AeroNotix: what exactly do you need the userAgent to detect?  can you provide a jsfiddle?
[08:02:56] <AeroNotix> dcherman: like I said, mouse button states.
[08:03:08] <AeroNotix> i.e. when all browsers have mouseups/downs
[08:03:16] <AeroNotix> and detect what state they are in *currently*
[08:03:33] <AeroNotix> jQuery has mouseups/downs, but I can't ask "what is the state of mb1 right now"
[08:04:35] <AeroNotix> it would be nice to have a function like. $.mouse.states() which returned an array of integers for all the states of the mice buttons, left to right
[08:04:35] <dcherman> AeroNotix: the order of mousedown/mouseup is pretty well defined - i dont believe there is an api for "what state is this button in right now".  still not sure what you need userAgent sniffing for
[08:04:46] <AeroNotix> dcherman: there is an api for that
[08:04:55] <AeroNotix> kind of
[08:05:19] <AeroNotix> what I am writing is kind of like the drag selection in libreoffice or something
[08:05:32] <AeroNotix> a number of table elements, drag across and select all of them
[08:05:38] <dcherman> AeroNotix: you might want to consider using jQueryUI Draggable/Droppable.
[08:05:47] <AeroNotix> nah, it's not *quite* what I need
[08:05:50] <AeroNotix> almost, not quite
[08:08:10] <pachet_> AeroNotix: https://gist.github.com/pachet/5749482
[08:08:14] <pachet_> look ma, no state
[08:09:00] <AeroNotix> dafuq am I supposed to do with that? Seriously.
[08:09:08] <AeroNotix> put it in a jsfiddle if you *really* want to make a point
[08:09:52] <AeroNotix> pachet_:
[08:10:28] <jop008> Anyone created a login page working under IE9?
[08:12:10] <sacho> No.
[08:12:13] <jedimind> jop008 yeah, millions of people
[08:12:24] <jedimind> do you think the internet is not accessible to ie9 at all ?
[08:12:37] <AeroNotix> What's with the hostility?
[08:13:14] <jop008> So are you 1 of the million using jqMobile?
[08:13:15] <jedimind> who's hostile?
[08:13:19] <skqr> Fight!
[08:13:34] <skqr> Lookout Scott, it's that one guy
[08:13:43] <jop008> I have a page works in all browsers but not in IE9. On the console is nothing
[08:13:55] <jop008> so hard to debug
[08:14:27] <jedimind> url?
[08:14:40] <sacho> I agree, the "doesn't work" error is really hard to debug.
[08:15:17] <AeroNotix> basically, javascript and the web are truly cross-platform and you just have to write your code once. Let's go home everyone, javascript will solve all our problems!
[08:16:23] <Saaether> my guess would be that its a problem with the trans-ambient demodulizer
[08:16:43] <warden23> Hello, is it possible to load the 'content' of a div from another page and present it on desired page?
[08:17:00] <jedimind> Saaether that fucking bug gets me every time
[08:17:14] <warden23> A bit like an iframe, except I don't want the entire other pages html displayed only a specific DIV content?
[08:17:14] <Saaether> warden23 same host?
[08:17:17] <AeroNotix> ITT: People who only know JS get to pretend they're hackers.
[08:17:21] <warden23> same host, same domain
[08:17:25] <Saaether> yup no problem
[08:17:33] <NoiseEee> AeroNotix: #bitching is thataway --->
[08:17:34] <Saaether> load(url #divname)
[08:17:37] <sacho> AeroNotix, an irc channel is not a thread.
[08:17:41] <jedimind> lol
[08:17:48] <AeroNotix> ITC: People who only know JS get to pretend they're hackers.
[08:17:48] <warden23> cool ill try that
[08:17:49] <AeroNotix> better?
[08:17:51] <Saaether> 'api load @ warden23
[08:17:55] <Saaether> `api load @ warden23
[08:17:55] <b-ot> warden23: .load(): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[08:18:02] <sacho> No, it's still nonsensical, but slightly less so.
[08:18:21] <jedimind> AeroNotix im sorry, are you trying to do passive aggressive commentary on the way we're interacting with the guy who "i has jquery problem, it no work"
[08:18:28] <jedimind> as the only input he has on getting help
[08:18:36] <warden23> Saaether will check it out now, thanks!
[08:18:49] <AeroNotix> sorry I'm just a little bit racist towards javascript 'programmers'
[08:19:02] <jedimind> then you're kind of in the wrong place arent you ?
[08:19:07] <AeroNotix> yeah
[08:19:08] <sacho> javascript programmers are not a race.
[08:19:17] <jedimind> sacho well...
[08:19:26] <jedimind> we are all kind of pael

[08:26:04] <Saaether> should
[08:26:24] <pachet_> oops, silly webkit
[08:26:25] <pachet_> http://jsfiddle.net/r6Rz6/
[08:26:27] <sacho> warden23, depends on your browser.
[08:26:45] <warden23> What do you mean?
[08:26:57] <warden23> I'm using firefox the newest stable version
[08:27:06] <warden23> and chrome and ie
[08:30:06] <warden23> $("#cart-extras-content").attr("src","http://localhost/spaceman/questions");
[08:30:09] <warden23> would be correct?
[08:30:49] <warden23> That would load the entire questions page into #cart-extras-content on the page with #cart-extras-content iframe correct?
[08:30:59] <Saaether> .. you didnt use load there
[08:31:00] <warden23> How do I select a specific div on that src page
[08:31:12] <Saaether> $("#cart-extras-content").load(url)
[08:31:48] <Saaether> $("#cart-extras-content").load('test.html #contentdiv')
[08:31:56] <newbiedoodoo> What is the URL for the jquery standard?  I would like to look up on()
[08:32:04] <warden23> ok ill try that, sorry my bad been at this for awhile lol

[08:33:38] <ShrtSong> Hey
[08:35:55] <ShrtSong> So I've run into a weird issue with using jquery.ajax().  My page is on localhost:44300, and the jquery.ajax() call is being made to localhost:9991/Ping/.  This works in Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc., but it does not work in IE.  The error message (obtained from the error: option in jquery.ajax() displays: "Error: Access Is Denied".
[08:36:00] <ShrtSong> Any guesses as to why this might be?
[08:36:32] <kzurawel> ShrtSong: If you're not making a jsonp request, it could be a cross-domain issue (different port number)
[08:36:58] <ShrtSong> It's just text
[08:37:02] <kzurawel> Hmm.
[08:37:23] <ShrtSong> In fact, navigating directly to localhost:9991/Ping/ in IE directly gives me the exact text I should be getting. (a version number)
[08:37:37] <ShrtSong> I have tried this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10232017/ie9-jquery-ajax-with-cors-returns-access-is-denied
[08:37:41] <ShrtSong> But no luck
[08:37:54] <ShrtSong> I set jquery.support.cors to true also
[08:38:03] <c4ptnh00k> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3586780/jquery-ajax-post-unsuccessful
[08:38:11] <c4ptnh00k> maybe that will help you
[08:38:11] <kzurawel> what did you set as the "type" for your request?
[08:38:18] <ShrtSong> It's "GET" not "POST"
[08:38:25] <ShrtSong> No parameters sent.
[08:38:31] <ShrtSong> type?
[08:38:40] <awc737> If I have multiple dropdowns, whose choices are determined by the choice of the dropdown before hand... would it be better to load all the data indexed or AJAX request on each dropdown selection?
[08:38:49] <kzurawel> ShrtSong: json, jsonp, html....
[08:38:56] <ShrtSong> Oh. 'text'
[08:38:59] <ShrtSong> dataType: 'text'
[08:39:09] <philhutchinson> awc737: jquery ajax request on change
[08:39:26] <philhutchinson> is generally how i do it
[08:39:31] <ShrtSong> Not that it matters but also set: crossDomain: true
[08:40:49] <ShrtSong> Doing searches on this, I find mixed answers. Some say it's a jquery bug that they refuse to fix because it's IE's problem. Some say it's a difference between XDomainRequest and XMLHttpRequest. etc.,
[08:40:58] <ShrtSong> I have been at this for a day now. Truly stumped. :(
[08:41:06] <ShrtSong> Well all Friday*.
[08:41:31] <c4ptnh00k> ShrtSong: jquery documentation for crossDomain:"This allows, for example, server-side redirection to another domain."
[08:41:50] <ShrtSong> Right, I would assume that includes port-number.
[08:42:00] <awc737> philhutchinson, thanks thats interesting, I would think it's slower?
[08:42:04] <c4ptnh00k> and you want this to happen?
[08:42:23] <warden23> Can you use jquery to hide all div's except one on a page?
[08:42:28] <sacho> yes
[08:42:31] <c4ptnh00k> yes
[08:42:37] <ShrtSong> Well, as I said, the script is hosted on localhost:44300, and the $.ajax() call is being made to localhost:9991
[08:42:52] <c4ptnh00k> ah
[08:42:56] <ShrtSong> Isn't that cross-domain?
[08:43:05] <NoiseEee> ShrtSong: yes
[08:43:07] <c4ptnh00k> yes
[08:43:42] <ShrtSong> Then I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Or what else to try even.
[08:43:53] <warden23> Saaether it works thanks, though I realise now that I need to do it through an iframe and hide everything except a certain DIV. As the DIV contains code inside that does calls etc
[08:44:00] <philhutchinson> awc737: you can index them if you want but getting live data is usually better
[08:44:03] <c4ptnh00k> shouldnt cross domain request be in the type jsonp?
[08:44:04] <warden23> If that makes sense
[08:44:05] <philhutchinson> depending on what you wanna do with it :p
[08:44:32] <sacho> ShrtSong, your code is?
[08:44:42] <philhutchinson> c4ptnh00k: it doesnt matter - FF will prevent cross domain requests natively for some reason
[08:44:46] <ShrtSong> sacho, let me do it up. Sec.
[08:45:39] <c4ptnh00k> ShrtSong: THis may help
[08:45:41] <c4ptnh00k> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7638773/cross-domain-requests-with-jquery
[08:46:35] <philhutchinson> warden23: yes, $("div").not(".donthide").hide();
[08:47:05] <philhutchinson> warden23: use class="donthide" on the div you dont want to hide
[08:49:54] <warden23> thanks philhutchinson trying it now
[08:50:05] <ShrtSong> http://jsfiddle.net/amyG4/
[08:50:55] <awc737> Phil-Work, why is live data better
[08:50:59] <awc737> I just want quickest loads possible
[08:51:13] <awc737> dropdown 1 has 10 options, each of those 10 has 10 possible options, and each of those 10 has 10 possible options
[08:51:15] <c4ptnh00k> slightlty less convoluted way is $('.hideme').css("visibility", false);
[08:51:27] <philhutchinson> c4ptnh00k: he said all divs but one
[08:51:40] <ShrtSong> c4ptnh00k, I don't know if that is related. The problem is happening only on IE. It works in every other browser.
[08:51:43] <philhutchinson> i assume hes triggering a button
[08:51:58] <philhutchinson> awc737: because if someone updates whats in the dropdowns and you've cached them on the page, then you wont get the updates
[08:52:04] <philhutchinson> again, it depends what youre putting in them
[08:52:16] <c4ptnh00k> He didnt say that so I am just going on a general assumtion
[08:53:29] <philhutchinson> he did
[08:53:31] <philhutchinson> c4ptnh00k:  <warden23> Can you use jquery to hide all div's except one on a page?
[08:53:42] <c4ptnh00k> but no said button
[08:53:55] <philhutchinson> but yours will hide one element
[08:54:00] <philhutchinson> or any element with class="hideme"
[08:54:13] <c4ptnh00k> oh crap  nvm i flipped it
[08:54:16] <philhutchinson> :D
[08:54:19] <c4ptnh00k> :(
[08:54:24] * philhutchinson ruffles c4ptnh00k
[08:54:34] <ShrtSong> sacho, any suggestions?
[08:54:35] <BillCriswell> flippin codes, making doughes
[08:54:35] <warden23> Does that just show the div in question or all the children of that div also?
[08:54:35] <c4ptnh00k> still early
[08:54:51] <philhutchinson> just the div afaik
[08:55:17] <ShrtSong> sacho, understandably, you can't really test that piece of code without an http server or listener set up on localhost:9991, but I can assure you even on jsfiddle, that is not working in IE.
[08:55:18] <warden23> Oh ok, is there a way to target that div + it's children?
[08:55:19] <c4ptnh00k> doh's
[08:55:35] <philhutchinson> eh
[08:55:44] <philhutchinson> warden23: yes, $("div").not(".donthide > *").hide();
[08:55:46] <c4ptnh00k> yes
[08:55:54] <philhutchinson> i think
[08:56:03] <philhutchinson> c4ptnh00k might be able to tell you better
[08:56:07] <philhutchinson> but i think that should work
[08:56:45] <c4ptnh00k> if you made the dive visible then all divs within that div are visible
[08:56:49] <c4ptnh00k> div
[08:56:53] <sacho> ShrtSong, which IE version?
[08:57:09] <ShrtSong> sacho, tested with any up to 9
[08:57:29] <sacho> what error are you getting with that code?
[08:58:15] <c4ptnh00k> warden23: it's all in how you hide the divs. If you simply hide all the parent divs then make one parent visible then that divs children will be visible
[08:58:24] <ShrtSong> Interestingly, on jsfiddle, I'm getting no error message at all. But on my local application, I'm getting "Error: Access is Denied"
[08:58:45] <sacho> with that code?
[08:58:45] <ShrtSong> Oh wait nvm
[08:58:51] <warden23> c4ptnh00k that's the logic I would assume but it doesn't seem to be working for me, let me put this in jsfiddle sec
[08:58:55] <ShrtSong> Would actually help if I had that <p class="message"> in html
[08:59:08] <ShrtSong> I am getting "Error: Access is Denied" in jsfiddle now.
[08:59:46] <sacho> you should be getting a no transport error. :/
[09:00:00] <c4ptnh00k> ShrtSong: then you must not be liked and the server denies you access. you should offer it a sacrifice as to appease these gods....
[09:00:55] <ShrtSong> c4ptnh00k, If only it were that simple. I'd gladly feed it one of my co-workers.
[09:01:02] <c4ptnh00k> :)
[09:01:32] <ShrtSong> Like I said, I've tried a number of different solutions. Even messed aroudn with the response headers.
[09:01:40] <warden23> c4ptnh00k: it does this http://jsfiddle.net/9e5Jj/
[09:01:54] <warden23> It should show the child div which should be a red square within that white
[09:02:17] <c4ptnh00k> warden23: because you are hiding the child
[09:04:02] <warden23> How do I rewrite that to hide all div's but .cart-extrashe and it's children?
[09:05:14] <warden23> Or is that not possible?
[09:05:17] <c4ptnh00k> http://jsfiddle.net/9e5Jj/1/
[09:05:39] <c4ptnh00k> just add the class you are checking for to the child div
[09:06:07] <warden23> ah I see what you have done
[09:06:22] <warden23> say I'm in a position where I can't for whatever reason
[09:06:23] <c4ptnh00k> this class name is just a selector(ie just an way to select the element) so it could be almost anything as long as you are consistent
[09:06:28] <warden23> can i add that .not to more then 1?
[09:06:43] <warden23> .not(".cart-extrashe, .redred")
[09:06:58] <c4ptnh00k> no comma
[09:06:59] <philhutchinson> close quotes first before naming another element
[09:07:05] <philhutchinson> or no comma
[09:07:06] <philhutchinson> :p
[09:07:20] <sacho> ShrtSong, I don't know why you aren't getting a "No Transport" error. jQuery doesn't define any transport for cross-domain requests that aren't a jsonp type on IE (when it's lacking xmlhttprequest)
[09:07:32] <warden23> $("div").not(".cart-extraashe .redred").hide();
[09:07:41] <sacho> ShrtSong, your two options would be to either use jsonp, or find a plugin that implemends a transport using IE's XDomainRequest
[09:07:54] <ShrtSong> sacho, will jsonp work?
[09:08:02] <sacho> yes
[09:08:12] <warden23> eep that didn't work lol
[09:08:22] <c4ptnh00k> but that is looking for for both classes to be present
[09:08:30] <warden23> http://jsfiddle.net/9e5Jj/2/
[09:08:31] <warden23> ah
[09:08:39] <c4ptnh00k> in this case you can always use a selector
[09:08:46] <warden23> I just meant if not present and if I didn't want to add .cart-extrashe to everything
[09:08:49] <ShrtSong> sacho, I'm not a jquery expert, but wouldn't jsonp expect a json response?
[09:08:57] <philhutchinson> warden23:
[09:08:58] <philhutchinson> http://jsfiddle.net/9e5Jj/3/
[09:09:03] <philhutchinson> use that
[09:09:19] <sacho> ShrtSong, it would expect a jsonp response.
[09:09:26] <sacho> Which is a javascript function call.
[09:09:26] <c4ptnh00k> lol wierd animation
[09:09:35] <warden23> yay thanks :D
[09:09:38] <philhutchinson> it was to show him what was happening
[09:09:38] <philhutchinson> lol
[09:09:39] <philhutchinson> :D
[09:09:47] <warden23> to you both :)
[09:10:12] <c4ptnh00k> warden23 the important thing to take away here is the use of multiple selectors
[09:10:25] <warden23> Yeah for sure
[09:10:37] <ShrtSong> sacho, is there any way I can make text work? I have to rewrite a lot of server code and learn how to return a jsonp result.
[09:10:38] <philhutchinson> ShrtSong: is there any reason you cant create a proxy on the same domain to masquerade the request for you?
[09:11:09] <ShrtSong> philhutchinson, proxy?
[09:11:22] <philhutchinson> yeah, why dont you stick a php file (or whatever language it is) on the same domain
[09:11:29] <philhutchinson> and make it do the request and return the result
[09:11:34] <philhutchinson> and just ajax to it
[09:11:54] <ShrtSong> well here's the scenario here, as odd as it may sound: the main server (localhost:44300) won't be on localhost. It will be on a site. The localhost:9991 "will" remain localhost (possibly different port number is all). The idea is the page is like the middleman between server and client.
[09:12:10] <ShrtSong> The client application has a small embedded jetty servlet built into it.
[09:12:23] <philhutchinson> so why cant you put a php file on the site
[09:12:27] <philhutchinson> which connects to the server and does the request
[09:12:36] <philhutchinson> and just point your JS at the php file on the site
[09:12:37] <ShrtSong> Because I'm working with MVC3.
[09:12:49] <philhutchinson> and what? lol
[09:12:59] <ShrtSong> IIS
[09:13:09] <philhutchinson> yeah, but so what?
[09:13:33] <philhutchinson> just hit a script on the same domain as the javascript file
[09:13:40] <philhutchinson> and use it to get your results
[09:14:13] <ShrtSong> I'm not sure I follow exactly. How does using php help in this scenario? php is just server-side, just like anything else. The ajax request is client-side. Once the page hits the browser.
[09:14:20] <philhutchinson> php was an example
[09:14:22] <ShrtSong> Which is what needs to happen, otherwise the page won't have access to localhost
[09:14:45] <ShrtSong> I can't make the server communicate with the local application. Firewalls/routers/etc., get in the way of that.
[09:14:51] <ShrtSong> not directly anyway
[09:15:10] <philhutchinson> right..
[09:15:18] <philhutchinson> I dont understand how you dont see this
[09:15:34] <philhutchinson> Create a script in a folder on the site, say in /ajax/
[09:15:38] <ShrtSong> Okay
[09:15:46] <philhutchinson> which will connect to your data source (so in this case your server)
[09:15:54] <philhutchinson> and instead of trying to hit your server, with the jquery request
[09:15:55] <ShrtSong> Hang on
[09:16:00] <philhutchinson> hit the script on your site
[09:16:15] <philhutchinson> which will pass the request to the server, meaning you dont have cross domain issues
[09:16:21] <ShrtSong> First of all, localhost:44300 is not going to be local. It will be separate from localhost:9991
[09:16:25] <philhutchinson> its still clientside
[09:16:31] <philhutchinson> it doesnt matter
[09:16:39] <sacho> ShrtSong, a plugin that supports ie's xdomainrequest
[09:16:47] <philhutchinson> Which one is your server ShrtSong ?
[09:16:55] <ShrtSong> localhost:44300
[09:16:59] <ShrtSong> localhost:9991 is the local app
[09:17:11] <philhutchinson> and youre writing this in what? ASP.NET?
[09:17:25] <ShrtSong> MVC3 with Razor markup
[09:17:39] <philhutchinson> ....so asp.net then
[09:17:49] <ShrtSong> Yes. (tho if I tell my boss that he'll spaz)
[09:18:22] <ShrtSong> (he's convinced asp.net = webforms)
[09:18:27] <ShrtSong> sorry, ===*
[09:18:44] <philhutchinson> right so put an ASP.NET script on localhost:9991 (say its accessible by: http://localhost:9991/script.asp), which connects to localhost:44300 and retrieves your data, and prints it to the screen
[09:19:00] <ShrtSong> The data isn't on localhost:44300
[09:19:06] <philhutchinson> where the fack is it then?
[09:19:21] <ShrtSong> I'm trying to retreive data from localhost:9991
[09:19:31] <philhutchinson> from the same domain?
[09:19:32] <ShrtSong> The page got served by localhost:44300, but the data is on localhost:9991
[09:19:38] <ShrtSong> no, different domain
[09:19:41] <ShrtSong> one is local, one's remote.
[09:19:59] <ShrtSong> sacho, what plugin?
[09:20:12] <philhutchinson> that makes no sense to me
[09:20:29] <philhutchinson> how can you connect to localhost:9991 and get a page served by a different service?
[09:20:49] <NoiseEee> ShrtSong: "localhost" = same machine. same box. same domain
[09:21:06] <philhutchinson> yeah and localhost is never remote
[09:21:13] <ShrtSong> philhutchinson, that's the idea. It tests the connection by making the call to localhost:9991/ping/.  If a version number doesn't get returned, it lets the user know they have to install the local application first.
[09:21:16] <NoiseEee> ShrtSong: "localhost:9199" vs "localhost:1234" - same domain, same box, different port, breaks Same Origin Policy only (a JS construct)
[09:21:51] <ShrtSong> NoiseEee, are you suggesting this won't happen if I try it on a remote server?
[09:21:58] <ShrtSong> like a different domain entirely?
[09:22:12] <ShrtSong> Because I tried with jsfiddle
[09:22:13] <ShrtSong> same error
[09:22:44] <ShrtSong> Y'know, now that I think of it, I'm getting: Error: Access is Denied, which leaves me to believe it's an issue with headers.
[09:22:58] <NoiseEee> ShrtSong: im suggesting that it wont work because it breaks SOP, but "localhost" is the exact same server box as "localhost"
[09:23:05] <NoiseEee> you seem to imply they are different.
[09:23:10] <ShrtSong> I've got: response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "*"); and response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); set in my java application
[09:24:03] <ShrtSong> Well, I'm assuming they are, because - well - they should be. They're only different ports because I have to test in this environment. Though again, it's not the problem because jsfiddle is giving me the same error.
[09:24:09] <ShrtSong> But it's good to know in case that does come up. Thank you. :)
[09:25:13] <warden23> philhutchinson and c4ptnh00k: I hit a road block: http://jsfiddle.net/9e5Jj/4/
[09:25:38] <warden23> If I put .cart-extrashe inside something it has a hissy fit :(
[09:27:23] <ShrtSong> I'm no expert, but when you hide a div, don't you hide all the child elements within it?
[09:28:06] <sacho> mismatching ports are not the same domain
[09:28:08] <c4ptnh00k> warden23: notice </body> is red
[09:28:19] <sacho> ShrtSong, IE 10 would work with that, but not IE9-.
[09:28:28] <warden23> ah didn't close a div
[09:28:44] <sacho> ShrtSong, because IE10 supports xmlhttprequest's CORS, but IE9 doesn't. You would need to find a plugin that implements an ajax transport which uses XDomainRequest.
[09:28:44] <warden23> still didn't fix it tho
[09:29:15] <ShrtSong> sacho, that's what I'm trying to accomplish. I've tried this: https://github.com/MoonScript/jQuery-ajaxTransport-XDomainRequest/blob/8754607e5f9ab73ccc37246f0c12fed14f85bd28/jQuery.XDomainRequest.js
[09:29:18] <ShrtSong> But no luck. :\
[09:29:29] <sacho> what happened when you tried it?
[09:29:53] <c4ptnh00k> warden you hid its parent though
[09:29:59] <warden23> c4ptnh00k: http://jsfiddle.net/9e5Jj/5/
[09:30:10] <warden23> ah ok, so there is no way around that?
[09:30:15] <ShrtSong> You didn't close 2 divs

[09:31:24] <ShrtSong> sacho, same error. Like nothing changed.  Now mind you, I set $.support.cors = true. In addition, I stuck an alert in the script to see if I get any messages back.
[09:31:28] <c4ptnh00k> warden23: notice he changed the selector to the parent div
[09:31:39] <warden23> lol 'tears'
[09:31:44] <warden23> yeah I noticed that
[09:31:50] <warden23> but what if it has like 4 different parents?
[09:31:59] <c4ptnh00k> continue the process
[09:32:00] <sacho> ShrtSong, you need to unset that.
[09:32:09] <sacho> ShrtSong, that implies that xmlhttprequest supports cors
[09:32:15] <ShrtSong> Oh duh!
[09:32:20] <warden23> ok sec
[09:32:22] <c4ptnh00k> if you hide the parent then the children will be hidden
[09:32:28] <ShrtSong> it says !jQuery.support.cors. Dooooooyyyy!
[09:32:47] <philhutchinson> if you want to use body, you need to do: http://jsfiddle.net/9e5Jj/7/
[09:33:15] <ShrtSong> sacho, k, so script fires correclty now, but no change. :(
[09:33:29] <ShrtSong> Same message when using $.ajax();
[09:33:58] <sacho> place a breakpoint in the send function of the plugin
[09:34:02] <sacho> see if it's using that transport.
[09:34:25] <ShrtSong> breakpoints? in javascript?! O.o
[09:34:36] <sacho> yes, use the dev tools for ie
[09:34:52] <ShrtSong> Like the console? Or are there actual dev tools?
[09:35:06] <sacho> the console is part of the dev tools
[09:35:14] <sacho> ie also has a debugger
[09:35:25] <sacho> check the script tab.
[09:35:52] <warden23> c4ptnh00k and philhutchinson: http://jsfiddle.net/9e5Jj/8/
[09:35:57] <sacho> alternatively you could just place a console.log in the send function
[09:36:07] <warden23> That should push it's limits of what I'm trying to achieve
[09:37:07] <c4ptnh00k> http://jsfiddle.net/9e5Jj/10/
[09:37:32] <hxxy383> where do i find information about how compare strings with jquery?
[09:37:38] <sacho> ShrtSong, if it's using the xdomainrequest transport then it might just be some localhost restriction. Like I said earlier, localhost restrictions vary from browser to browser. You might need to fiddle with the security settings.
[09:37:40] <warden23> ah I see, it'll show all of it's children
[09:37:48] <ShrtSong> Ggggaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! It's on-page script. :c Gonna have to move everything into it's own script file first, sacho. gonna be a min.
[09:37:52] <warden23> was trying to avoid the yellow and blue
[09:37:54] <hxxy383> I want to build for myself a small codeblock with syntaxhighlighter
[09:37:54] <warden23> for example
[09:38:15] <c4ptnh00k> warden23: If you hade the parent you hide the children
[09:38:33] <c4ptnh00k> hide
[09:38:33] <warden23> ahk i think it's sunk in :)
[09:38:43] <sacho> ShrtSong, one of the "scripts" should be your html page
[09:38:43] <warden23> Shame tho
[09:38:50] <c4ptnh00k> not really
[09:39:01] <c4ptnh00k> there are other ways
[09:39:24] <warden23> you mean non jquery ways?
[09:39:35] <ShrtSong> sacho, "Dynamic Scripts". The page is loaded dynamically. Everything is all ajaxy (not my idea mind you).
[09:39:44] <sacho> oh.
[09:39:51] <sacho> well, a console.log() would be faster, then.
[09:40:27] <c4ptnh00k> warden23: no just more task specific
[09:41:09] <warden23> ahk, np ill have a look around thanks for all the help
[09:41:19] <ShrtSong> naw, I should put everything into their own .js file anyway. I was being lazy with this because it's just a debug panel for the local app.
[09:41:22] <c4ptnh00k> warden23: forinstance if I wanted to just "hide the middle elements I would just go about it differently
[09:41:48] <c4ptnh00k> warden23: nP :P
[09:41:51] <warden23> Any tips of what I can google then?
[09:41:54] <ShrtSong> I'm actually quite proud of the debug panel I built. Most extensive bit of jquery I've ever done. Was fun. :3
[09:41:57] <c4ptnh00k> lol google
[09:42:01] <warden23> lol
[09:42:06] <ShrtSong> until ie happened
[09:42:23] <warden23> I've tried google but it's hard to find exactly what I'm after in this instance
[09:42:34] <c4ptnh00k> just say like only hide inner div
[09:42:52] <c4ptnh00k> only hide nth child
[09:43:11] <warden23> ok
[09:46:01] <ShrtSong> sacho, the send function wasn't hit in the plugin
[09:47:14] <ShrtSong> One of the conditions in the if statement (with the 'options' stuff) is breaking it.
[09:47:32] <warden23> I suppose I could hide all div's under a certain parent and then clone a child div that is hidden under it's parent to show it?
[09:48:42] <ShrtSong> "and same scheme as calling page"... What's a "scheme" sacho?
[09:52:34] <ShrtSong> That scheme part is where it's returning false.
[09:52:34] <sacho> sorry
[09:53:09] <sacho> ShrtSong, protocol
[09:53:20] <ShrtSong> Ah... There we go!
[09:53:27] <ShrtSong> Should've more specifically said:
[09:53:31] <sacho> just get rid of it
[09:53:43] <warden23> Can jQuery be used to refresh the parent page (outside of the iFrame)?
[09:53:46] <ShrtSong> https://localhost:44300 is the server and http://localhost:9991 is the local app
[09:54:04] <sacho> ah.
[09:54:12] <sacho> well, IE's errors are notoriously useful.
[09:54:39] <sacho> I also don't know why the schemes must match.
[09:55:03] <sacho> ah, the intent was to prevent the reverse
[09:55:08] <sacho> (https to http)
[09:55:40] <sacho> ShrtSong, check this out -> http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx
[09:57:50] <sacho> ShrtSong, looks like you could have a workaround for the protocol mismatch via iframes and the messaging system
[09:58:09] <sacho> At this point, though, I'd consider the solution about as complicated as jsonp. :)
[09:58:39] <ShrtSong> brutal
[09:58:40] <ShrtSong> hm
[09:59:20] <ShrtSong> This poses a major issue because a lot of my local app returns xml data.
[10:03:15] <sacho> well, the iframes and messaging thing isn't that bad.
[10:03:27] <sacho> you could bake it into the transport plugin, maybe.
[10:03:39] <sacho> actually you should be able to.
[10:04:44] <ShrtSong> ugh. That's going to be a huge pain
[10:05:06] <ShrtSong> I'd be building an entire solution entirely for internet explorer alone
[10:05:22] <sacho> welcome to web development
[10:07:59] <ShrtSong> k, well, let's see... Is it possible to just stick with https instead? As irrelevant as that may be on a local system. :\
[10:08:41] <ShrtSong> ugh. just as much of a headache
[10:09:41] <fusion27> Can I write these 3 lines as one selector? http://pastie.org/8031143#1-3
[10:09:54] <fusion27> if yes, how?
[10:10:07] <Saaether> which 3, theres 9 there lol
[10:11:08] <vedic> Does jquery supports css3? Does that adds support for browser without manually prefixing webkit or moz  etc?
[10:12:06] <sacho> Ð½Ð¾
[10:12:09] <sacho> no*
[10:14:05] <ShrtSong> sacho, k. So are you suggesting I try that oProxy thing or is there a link to that iframes/messaging solution?
[10:14:27] <sacho> oProxy thing?
[10:15:10] <ShrtSong> http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx
[10:15:19] <ShrtSong> Under issue #7
[10:16:09] <sacho> oh, yeah.
[10:16:46] <ShrtSong> wtf is oProxy anyway?
[10:16:51] <ShrtSong> I don't see a src for that anywhere
[10:17:55] <Musk> Multiple div in Footer in JQuery Mobile.. how to handle ? :/
[10:20:20] <fusion27> Musk: what's in the multiple divs?
[10:20:45] <Musk> <ads></ads> <navs></navs> to make it simple
[10:21:15] <Musk> but mainly the primary block being the footer would contain 2 blocks..
[10:21:48] <Musk> simple but for some reason the second block appears in my list viewâ€¦ not emclose in the footer 'visualy'
[10:21:53] <Musk> enclose*
[10:25:35] <BillCriswell> End of the kitty names. =(
[10:26:10] <BillCriswell> My dreams os OSX Liger will not be fulfilled.
[10:42:51] <acas4u> hi
[10:43:29] <acas4u> im creating a little weather underground app
[10:43:59] <acas4u> is this room the best suited for asking questions surrounding this topic?
[10:44:36] <shoky> acas4u: if you have a jquery issue/question, then yeah
[10:46:54] <ShrtSong> sacho, I think the reason I'm getting Access is Denied instead of ... whatever the other message was ... is because I believe XDomainRequest was integrated into jquery's ajax calls after 1.9.  That doesn't help me at all obviously, but something I thought I'd share. I might be wrong still.
[10:47:08] <sacho> ShrtSong, it wasn't.
[10:49:21] <ShrtSong> Ah
[10:49:38] <ShrtSong> Then I'm stumped. I dunno why I'm getting that error, but it's the one I'm getting. :\
[10:49:41] <sirspazzolot> so I've got this div here, and if I assign it to node and try node.height() my script hangs. node.clientheight works fine here
[10:49:51] <ShrtSong> Well lunchtime. Thanks for your help sacho. :) At least I made some progress.
[10:50:22] <sirspazzolot> 'Object doesn't support propery or method 'height'' pretty sure it does
[10:51:23] <shoky> sirspazzolot: i'm guessing node is a dom node not wrapped in a jquery object. only jquery objects have .height()
[10:51:53] <sirspazzolot> oh, yeah you're spot on haha
[10:51:55] <sirspazzolot> thanks
[10:57:44] <jmmy> jquery .data() is same as the new html5 Web Storage or was it around before it?
[10:59:21] <shoky> jmmy: they have nothing to do with eachother.  .data() isn't persisted between page loads
[11:00:22] <jmmy> so if we wanted to use the new Web Storage html5 stuff, we have write in javascript, how to use it in jquery?
[11:00:51] <jmmy> shoky, thx
[11:01:06] <shoky> you can write javascript with your jquery code.. it's all javascript
[11:01:26] <shoky> there's also probably jquery plugins for the storage stuff
[11:02:18] <KingGreed> Hi ! Is there a way to drag elements between "two clicks" instead of between mouse down and mouse up ?
[11:03:28] <sacho> sure?
[11:03:40] <sacho> unless you mean to use $.draggable for it
[11:04:01] <KingGreed> yes I'd like to use $.draggable unless it's impossible
[11:14:31] <warden23> Anyone know the PHP channel?
[11:14:40] <sacho> ##php
[11:14:42] <warden23> thx
[11:14:45] <warden23> ##php
[11:14:47] <warden23> whoops
[11:14:48] <warden23> lol
[11:15:20] <warden23> doh
[11:15:22] <warden23> says +r
[11:16:08] <warden23> Considering I can't join it, can anyone help me with this: echo JHTML::_ ('link', JRoute::_ ('index.php?blahblah), $image, array('title' => $product->product_name));
[11:16:13] <sacho> yes, your nick needs to be registered
[11:16:14] <warden23> How do I add target="_blank"
[11:16:16] <warden23> in their
[11:16:20] <warden23> it is tho?
[11:16:32] <warden23> there*
[11:16:46] <sacho> It's not.
[11:16:52] <sacho> Or at least, you haven't identified.
[11:16:57] <warden23> strange, brb
[11:17:33] <warden23> ah thx
[11:20:06] <KingGreed> Anyone knows a way to drag elements between "two clicks" instead of between mouse down and mouse up with the jquery UI draggable ?
[11:20:45] <KingGreed> or to prevent the drop on draggable stop ?
[11:32:48] <Schonert> anyone with experience in stellar.js?
[11:48:21] <sirspazzolot> do you guys have any ideas as to why this element isn't returning a defined value in my script? calling $(object).height() from a console returns a value as expected
[11:48:42] <Saaether> `demo @ sirspazzolot
[11:48:43] <b-ot> sirspazzolot: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:49:58] <sirspazzolot> Saaether: issue exists on an internal site; it's sharepoint so making a fiddle to reproduce the problem is rather hard
[11:50:25] <Saaether> well a generic question with no code makes it impossible for any one here to help you
[11:50:59] <sirspazzolot> yeah heh. I was hoping it was some commonly overlooked issue
[11:52:39] <Saaether> if it gives you an answer when to access it via console and not when its running in the script would mean that it has no value when the script is trying to access it
[11:52:50] <Saaether> and its being set after
[11:53:17] <sirspazzolot> which is confusing me greatly heh
[11:53:38] <sirspazzolot> if I could recreate this error on anything other than generated sharepoint code I'd at least know what the issue is heh
[11:53:50] <sirspazzolot> sorry if I came across as snarky, I've been staring at my monitor for three hours
[11:54:28] <Saaether> its all good, debugging can be a pain
[11:58:59] <ShrtSong> sacho, D: The issue is still happening in ie10
[11:59:01] <ShrtSong> whaaaat?
[11:59:20] <sacho> dunno
[12:07:34] <scottalan> I'm having an issue with .click between jQuery versions. The selector is: $('#om-maximenu-5-areas-of-focus .om-link[rel=om-maximenu-modal]'). With jquery version 1.5 it works as expected but with 1.7/1.8 I can't trigger a click.
[12:08:28] <scottalan> I was thinking that maybe [rel=*] changed but I'm not as versed in jquery
[12:14:22] <trewq> Hi Folks, I am new to javascript and I want to find out how (is there an even that is bound) the modal box appears when I click on the "Modal Dialog" button in http://www.keenthemes.com/preview/metronic/ui_general.html
[12:14:30] <sacho> so your issue is the selector, not click()? That's easy to test - just check the length of the collection object.
[12:15:15] <trewq> *event
[12:16:09] <trewq> in other words, how does it trigger the model and how can I find the code that is run when I click on the button?
[12:19:00] <_rgn> trewq: it's the data-toggle="modal" attribute
[12:21:12] <trewq> _rgn: thanks for the reply - does that trigger anything? How were you able to find out the this attribute triggers something, and what code is run when it is clicked?
[12:22:52] <Saaether> trewq there is a listener for it in the framework
[12:23:45] <alex______> sup
[12:23:48] <alex______> guys ;)
[12:24:14] <xrosnight>  :D
[12:25:09] <trewq> Saaether: so how do I find the listener?
[12:26:49] <Saaether> search the framework for it?
[12:28:38] <c4ptnh00k> the only way to catch a listener is by standong on one leg and clucking like a chicken until you draw it out of hiding. The bash it in the head with a bat before he knows whats going on and destroys you
[12:29:10] <myosotis> my co-workers hate it when I'm hunting for listeners
[12:29:19] <Saaether> trewq if you want to know what file its in look at http://www.keenthemes.com/preview/metronic/assets/plugins/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js
[12:29:27] <myosotis> we use tennis rackets though
[12:29:38] <c4ptnh00k> that should do it
[12:29:39] <Saaether> and do a search for data-toggle="modal"
[12:30:28] <trewq> thanks - I will look there. I do know these are dumb questions, but I am learning and thanks for the direction.
[12:31:05] <c4ptnh00k> no dumb questions
[12:31:09] <Saaether> the code from the framework wont really help you much, if you want help with the modals look at http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals
[12:31:11] <c4ptnh00k> no such thing
[12:31:26] <c4ptnh00k> now snipes those bastards are annoying
[12:31:32] <_rgn> trewq: I removed the attribute and the modal dialog no longer appeared, theoretically you could find the modal dialog code by adding a debugger breakpoint to mouse click but the call stack is so deep that it's a much better idea to just find the modal dialog code from twitter bootstrap
[12:32:13] <_rgn> not to mention that the code is minified all over
[12:32:39] <c4ptnh00k> _rgn: you can "unminify" it in dev tools
[12:32:43] <_rgn> i know
[12:33:22] <_rgn> it's still unreadable if you're trying to learn something
[12:33:35] <c4ptnh00k> ... i dunno about that
[12:34:48] <c4ptnh00k> complete entry level into dev would have a difficult time, but good code is fairly readable
[12:35:06] <trewq> _rgn: ok, I see.. good way to find the attribute. Reading the modal docs now
[12:39:32] <trewq> so bootstrap framework is waiting to see if an element with  data-toggle="modal" is clicked, then the target (the modal window) is shown
[12:42:38] <trewq> I would like a button to make an ajax call, and would like to do this in a clean fashion. I think the correct way to do this is to make the function in app.js ( http://www.keenthemes.com/preview/metronic/assets/scripts/app.js ).
[12:43:35] <c4ptnh00k> just make a click even and make an ajax call
[12:43:43] <c4ptnh00k> what do you mean a clean ways?
[12:43:53] <_rgn> trewq: don't mix your own code with the framework's
[13:03:42] <unnu> so how do i check if an input tag has something in it or not?
[13:03:43] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/6WZUn/
[13:04:55] <delboy1978uk> i'm having issue getting animate working (line 72) http://jsfiddle.net/9PgQ6/8/
[13:09:30] <delboy1978uk> can anyone help me get my flip switch working? can't get it to animate (line 72) http://jsfiddle.net/9PgQ6/8/
[13:09:36] <shoky> delboy1978uk: you need something like this  https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/bgpos.js
[13:09:50] <shoky> delboy1978uk: to enable background-position animation
[13:10:52] <delboy1978uk> didn't background position animation used to just work out of the box?
[13:11:27] <shoky> delboy1978uk: it's not a single numeric value, so no
[13:11:45] <delboy1978uk> ah! right i got you
[13:12:30] <trewq> ok - I have made more progress now - Here is the http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=RSZ1Y6My I am using. What code would I need in the function to replace the "Request Review" text from the button with the results of ajax call.. How do I refer to the button uniquely
[13:12:47] <shoky> well maybe it worked with some old version donno
[13:15:24] <trewq> i.e. there are two buttons, so how would I detect the button that made the call?
[13:15:31] <delboy1978uk> awesome! i got it working!
[13:15:46] <delboy1978uk> i forgot there is also background-position-x !
[13:16:07] <delboy1978uk> cool, now i'll stick it on github and submit it to the jquery plugins
[13:16:22] <shoky> delboy1978uk:  background-position-x won't work on firefox iirc
[13:16:33] <delboy1978uk> ffs! really?
[13:16:49] <shoky> iirc ;p
[13:17:18] * delboy1978uk loads firefox
[13:17:20] <shoky> trewq: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7gtaX/
[13:17:55] <delboy1978uk> jesus christ firefox sucks why doesn't it support that?
[13:18:09] <trewq> shoky: thanks - checking it out now
[13:18:48] <delboy1978uk> is there a jquery test for firefox?
[13:19:33] <shoky> delboy1978uk: there's a test for background-position-x in that bgpos.js i linked you to
[13:19:48] * delboy1978uk checks again
[13:21:41] <trewq> shoky: does el.data('url') return the data-url value from <a> ?
[13:25:15] <shoky> trewq: yep
[13:26:28] <trewq> is data-url (i.e. using "data" and hyphen") something special in js? I mean - it is not the same as bob-url and call using el.bob("url")
[13:27:13] <jonez> trewq, try it
[13:27:43] <trewq> I already did - it did not work.. wanted to see if it is called something specific so I can look it up
[13:28:43] <shoky> trewq: it's not special in js. it's special in html5 i think, and in jquery's .data() method
[13:29:20] <trewq> ah - I see. the .data breaks up the data-url into url.
[13:29:31] <trewq> hooking up the ajax now
[13:31:38] <maxmoore14> is it possible to attach a click event to the entire document/window/viewport/whatever? Let's say I have something like $('#somebutton').on('click', function(){}) and document.on('click', function(){}) which would trigger first if the button is clicked?
[13:32:05] <maxmoore14> assuming I attach the button click handler first...
[13:32:23] <maxmoore14> would this vary by browser do you think?
[13:32:40] <maxmoore14> not sure on the bubble order precedence of document level events
[13:34:06] <juboba> Hey, I'm creating a plugin and was wondering how can I apply my plugin to all elements. Right now I do $('.elements').each(function(){$(this).myplugin()}); But I want to be able to do $(.elements).myplugin();
[13:35:56] <sacho> what's the problem with doing that?
[13:35:57] <jonez> juboba, does the each() work ?
[13:36:26] <juboba> it does
[13:36:38] <juboba> should I do the each inside the constructor declaration?
[13:37:19] <shoky> maxmoore14 if you use jquery for the events (or prolly any modern lib) then the events bubble UP the dom. so button first, then document
[13:39:10] <maxmoore14> shoky: that's what I figured, I'm thinking I'll need to create a div "screen" that just covers everything in order to capture the first click event
[13:39:18] <shoky> juboba: $.fn.myplugin = function() { return this.each(function() { ... }); }
[13:39:51] <shoky> maxmoore14: you can use $(document) too
[13:40:31] <shoky> maxmoore14: or maybe i misunderstood you hm
[13:41:53] <juboba> thnx  shoelessone
[13:42:00] <juboba> thnx  shoky
[13:42:09] <unnu> how hard is it to check if a file input feild has a .val()?
[13:42:10] <shoelessone> Well, I helped a little too i guess
[13:42:11] <maxmoore14> shoky: I'm trying to build a feature similar to selecting multiple icons in a folder. Once the first icon is selected, clicking anywhere on the page EXCEPT another icon should de-select the icons
[13:42:15] <shoelessone> by being here, for moral support
[13:42:20] <unnu> does jquery have any logic functions?
[13:42:24] <unnu> mainly if
[13:42:31] <shoky> ...
[13:42:49] <shoky> unnu:  jquery is in javascript
[13:42:51] <myosotis> unnu, what do you need to do that javascript logic constructs can't do?
[13:42:55] <unnu> lol
[13:42:57] <unnu> well
[13:43:01] <unnu> i had a retard moment
[13:43:04] <unnu> just ignore me
[13:43:06] <unnu> XD
[13:43:11] <unnu> omg
[13:43:13] <NoiseEee> unnu: if(someField.val()=='') { //nothin' there }
[13:43:14] <unnu> i am stupid
[13:43:26] <unnu> <3s guys
[13:43:27] <myosotis> they do have selector modification functions, like .not('some_selector'); =\
[13:43:27] <unnu> sorry
[13:43:56] <unnu> nahhh, i just wanna get this working http://jsfiddle.net/6WZUn/
[13:45:11] <unnu> i broke it :(
[13:45:40] <clov3r_> unnu: what's wrong with it?
[13:45:47] <unnu> if ($this.val() == ''){ } ?
[13:46:06] <unnu> just want it to work correctly
[13:46:12] <unnu> right now if you choose a file
[13:46:15] <unnu> and then rechoose a file
[13:46:21] <unnu> it adds another input feild
[13:46:22] <shoky> unnu: btw you better not do  $('<input/>').attr('type', 'file')  in IE.  $('<input type="file"/>')  plz
[13:46:44] <unnu> IE <10
[13:47:19] <unnu> lol okay, ill keep it browser compats
[13:47:22] <trewq> shoky: i am debugging some ajax problems - My ajax call return json like this:{"message": "You messed up", "result": "failed"}  how do I access message in js?
[13:47:42] <trewq> *"message" in js
[13:48:39] <myosotis> trewq, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ has decent examples
[13:48:40] <shoky> trewq:  $.ajax({url: url, type: 'get', dataType: 'json'}).done(function(data) { console.log(data.message) })
[13:48:58] <trewq> data.message it is
[13:49:37] <shoky> assuming you're using getJSON or the right dataType or the right content-type header in the response
[13:51:14] <unnu> yo, shoky, how does one access the .val of my input.file? this.val()
[13:51:35] <shoky> unnu: i'm not sure you can. file inputs aren't like regular inputs
[13:51:42] <unnu> i know
[13:51:47] <unnu> :'(
[13:51:49] <trewq> shoky: Thank you very much for your help. it works
[13:51:52] <myosotis> I'm certain that in some browsers it returns a file name, without the path
[13:52:10] <myosotis> jQuery(file-input-selector).val()
[13:52:11] <unnu> i just wanna check if they have already selected a file in that input tag
[13:52:35] <unnu> if they haven't then add a new input tag, if they have then dont
[13:53:08] <unnu> so when they click on it, if there is already a file name there, it doesn't add a new tag for another file, it just updates the file for that tag
[13:53:17] <unnu> that made no sense when i read it back to myself, sorry
[13:53:36] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/6WZUn/3/ @ unnu
[13:54:20] <unnu> ahhh $(this)
[13:54:26] <unnu> i really need to learn this crap
[13:54:33] <myosotis> as a fun side-effect, it creates a new file input when you clear the current value as well.
[13:54:35] <unnu> i know like 1% of JS and jq
[13:55:39] <Anton--> Hi, I'm having a really weird issue here, I've called a click event on a dropdown <a>, but in google chrome, the dropdown isn't shown, the button is simply highlighted in blue.
[13:55:55] <Anton--> However, if I copy the same line of code in the console and exectute it, the dropdown is shown.
[13:56:12] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/6WZUn/5/ works
[14:07:30] <KebabBob> Is it possible to display an alert for just a few seconds?
[14:08:12] <NoiseEee> KebabBob: no, but you can present something that looks like an alert for a few seconds, via css/markup etc
[14:08:18] <myosotis> an alert() box? or some other element that appears to be an alert?
[14:08:35] <KebabBob> I was hoping it was possible with just an alert(), but I figured it wouldn't be :)
[14:09:20] <KebabBob> something like a = alert('fooo'); setTimeout(5000, alert.goaway());
[14:10:17] <NoiseEee> KebabBob: correct, no such thing.
[14:12:55] <eddiemonge> KebabBob: not using the builtin alert because it pauses everything
[14:13:25] <ShrtSong> So, is there anything fancy I have to do to tell IE10 to use XMLHttpRequest instead of XDomainRequest?
[14:13:32] <ShrtSong> Or is it all just magic and built-in?
[14:17:25] <cwatson> Perhaps I need some more coffee, but I cannot figure out why this isn't animating left - http://jsfiddle.net/9rcC4/
[14:17:27] <cwatson> Any ideas?
[14:17:49] <cwatson> http://jsfiddle.net/9rcC4/1/
[14:18:26] <Krambiorix> hi, is it possible to serialize only a part of a form? I have  a table in a form and want to serialize on a per row basis
[14:19:09] <shoky> ShrtSong: it'll use what you tell it to use, i imagine.. depends which object you create, xdr or xhr
[14:19:50] <sacho> ShrtSong, jquery will use xhr
[14:19:54] <ShrtSong> shoky, I meant with like jQuery.ajax
[14:19:55] <ShrtSong> Yah, k.
[14:19:57] <JohnnyCache> d
[14:20:02] <ShrtSong> I am still stumped on this one projbect
[14:20:03] <ShrtSong> problem*
[14:20:10] <shoky> if you don't use any xdr transport then jquery will use xhr yeah
[14:20:26] <ShrtSong> jQuery.ajax() and IE10
[14:20:33] <ShrtSong> It's giving: "Error: Access is Denied"
[14:20:43] <ShrtSong> I've set the headers to Allow-Control-Access-Origin: *
[14:20:45] <shoky> ShrtSong: does your server support CORS
[14:20:46] <shoky> ah
[14:20:56] <ShrtSong> Shhhhould... shouldn't it?
[14:21:01] <ShrtSong> jQuery.support.cors = true;
[14:21:04] <shoky> dont do that
[14:21:07] <shoky> wrong
[14:21:07] <ShrtSong> okay
[14:21:16] <ShrtSong> then that's off
[14:21:28] <shoky> but rather.. check its value :P
[14:21:33] <ShrtSong> I've tried building the xhr manually and testing that. Same error
[14:21:41] <ShrtSong> Huh?  Okay.
[14:22:16] <shoky> $.support.xx are for reading, not writing
[14:22:21] <ShrtSong> It's automagically true
[14:22:52] <shoky> show yer code?
[14:23:52] <Krambiorix> shoky any idea?
[14:24:05] <cwatson> Can someone help me with this basic jQuery animation? Not sure why it's not working - http://jsfiddle.net/9rcC4/1/
[14:24:19] <ShrtSong> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/amyG4/10/
[14:24:20] <shoky> Krambiorix: you can call .serialize() on the elements you wanna serialize
[14:25:13] <shoky> ShrtSong: and your original page is on a webserver too?
[14:25:23] <ShrtSong> huh?
[14:25:32] <ShrtSong> Yes
[14:25:32] <shoky> not from the local filesystem, i mean
[14:25:34] <ShrtSong> It's an IIS web server
[14:25:46] <ShrtSong> IIS Express currently
[14:26:03] <ShrtSong> The target is cross-domain (well, localhost:33400 to localhost:9991)
[14:26:16] <shoky> do you see the cors headers when requesting that page?
[14:26:26] <shoky> like if you go directly to that url
[14:26:36] <ShrtSong> Yes. If I go to it in firefox or something, yah
[14:26:38] <jmmy> if we wanted to use the new Web Storage html5 stuff, do we have write in javascript, is there a way to do it in jquery?
[14:26:40] <ShrtSong> in IE, I can't view it at all
[14:26:52] <shoky> oh?
[14:27:10] <shoky> what happens when you go to that url
[14:27:17] <ShrtSong> Gives me the result.
[14:27:23] <ShrtSong> Even if I go directly there in IE10
[14:27:29] <ShrtSong> Shows the proper value, which is a text value
[14:27:30] <ShrtSong> 0.1
[14:27:46] <shoky> then, what cant you view at all?
[14:28:11] <ShrtSong> Well, the headers in IE10 through the ajax call
[14:28:21] <ShrtSong> I can view them through the ajax call in firebug on firefox.
[14:28:26] <ShrtSong> but not in IE's dev thing
[14:28:45] <ShrtSong> I have been stumped with this since this morning
[14:29:56] <shoky> maybe it's some security setting in IE? duno
[14:31:17] <ShrtSong> That's what I was thinking at first too.
[14:31:30] <ShrtSong> There is a setting for cross-domain browsing, but that's been set correctly. :\
[14:32:08] <ShrtSong> k, first of all, let me clarify something...
[14:32:11] <ShrtSong> The headers...
[14:32:13] <jmmy> why do people want to do cross-domain stuff?
[14:32:22] <ShrtSong> Do they have to be set FOR the page the script is on?  Or the page the script is requesting?
[14:32:26] <shoky> jmmy: why not
[14:32:29] <NoiseEee> jmmy: easy API access?
[14:32:40] <jmmy> shoky, dunno, that's my question
[14:32:56] <shoky> ShrtSong: for the requested page. e.g  http://localhost:9991/Ping/
[14:32:56] <jmmy> NoiseEee, huh?
[14:33:11] <tomivs> How to apply the script for the all classess? http://pastebin.com/5EqajiSD
[14:33:42] <ShrtSong> shoky, yah, that's what I thought. :\ No change.
[14:33:57] <NoiseEee> var latestQuotes = $.ajax({url:'someOtherSite.com/stockQuotes/latest}); for example, jmmy
[14:34:01] <shoky> jmmy: because there is a page they want to access that's on a different domain..
[14:34:29] <jmmy> I see, to import content from another site.  Yes that's what I just recalled hearing about once before
[14:34:38] <jmmy> NoiseEee, cool, thx
[14:34:41] <Krambiorix> shoky, but every row has the same name of elements
[14:35:10] <cwatson> This chat seems popular today. Anyone got time to fix a basic animate jQuery function I have? - Perhaps I need some more coffee, but I cannot figure out why this isn't animating left - http://jsfiddle.net/9rcC4/1/
[14:35:30] <cwatson> Well, show me what is wrong. Not fix.
[14:35:47] <myosotis> oh it is animating properly
[14:35:57] <myosotis> I imagine your css is just a little off
[14:36:24] <cwatson> myosotis: Should I go to #CSS?
[14:36:54] <anton164> Alright, I've tried everything to avail, why does a simple .click() not work on an element in my code, when it works from the console?
[14:37:11] <anton164> no avail*
[14:37:12] <shoky> Krambiorix: why? anyways.. select the elemtns you want and call .serialize() on them
[14:37:17] <myosotis> no clue, my company won't let me touch css =)
[14:37:42] <myosotis> something about their eyes burning of our their skulls, or something
[14:38:26] <cwatson> Wonder if CSS is faster than JS.
[14:38:49] <cwatson> Oh, well. That's out of scope.
[14:39:32] <myosotis> cwatson, master troll?
[14:40:23] <jmmy> cwatson, as a rule, I was consider it better to use css when you can and then use js for stuff on top of it. css might not be faster buts its easier
[14:40:30] <shoky> ShrtSong: is this working for ya?  http://bit.ly/1bpxTgr
[14:41:33] <cwatson> jmmy: Cool. Thanks.
[14:41:34] <jmmy> I didn't do any extensive testing, but the basic cssanimations and jquery animate() perform same
[14:42:02] <shoky> ShrtSong:  btw... you said:  Allow-Control-Access-Origin: *
[14:42:10] <ShrtSong> er
[14:42:13] <ShrtSong> Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[14:42:16] <shoky> k ;p
[14:42:17] <cwatson> myosotis: It was somewhat relevant. How is that trolling?
[14:42:17] <ShrtSong> That's what I had
[14:42:17] <ShrtSong> sorry
[14:42:36] <ShrtSong> shoky! This is awesome! It says it worked, but I have no idea why, but it's at least progress! :D
[14:42:46] <ShrtSong> I used remote: http://localhost:9991/Ping/
[14:43:07] <shoky> ShrtSong: oh. mm i dont really know this tool, just found it now ;S
[14:43:10] <ShrtSong> Darnit!
[14:43:16] <ShrtSong> Did it in firefox. -_- Not IE
[14:43:20] <shoky> lol
[14:43:45] <shoky> it also has a bug in IE9 it seems
[14:44:34] <jmmy> I learned about html5 Web Storage.  Is it true that the jquery .data() method is safer?
[14:45:23] <cwatson> Can anyone help me with this? - http://jsfiddle.net/9rcC4/1/
[14:45:36] <shoky> ShrtSong: this one's simpler  https://test-cors.appspot.com/#technical
[14:47:04] <ShrtSong> I'm using IE10 tho. :c
[14:47:50] <shoky> yea, i just wanted to see it fail in IE9 but it failed for a diff reason. (the first tool, not this simpler one)
[14:48:10] <shoky> ShrtSong: so that last one is working for you in IE10?
[14:48:19] <ShrtSong> No it isn't. :(
[14:48:34] <ShrtSong> That's what's confusing me
[14:48:56] <ShrtSong> It SHOULD work in IE10. Supposedly - according to online sources - XMLHttpRequest should work normally in ie10
[14:49:13] <ShrtSong> http://encosia.com/using-cors-to-access-asp-net-services-across-domains/
[14:49:21] <shoky> it's working for me in IE10
[14:49:53] <ObamaAddicts> My name is Joe and I am a jQuery cock.
[14:52:34] <ShrtSong> shoky, it is?
[14:52:48] <ObamaAddicts> Zepto fags.
[14:52:50] <ShrtSong> The server on port 9991 is an embedded jetty server
[14:53:00] <ShrtSong> If that makes any diff
[14:53:33] <shoky> ObamaAddicts: enough?
[14:54:21] <shoky> ShrtSong: yea its working for me.. and nah that shouldn't matter
[14:54:23] <danfromuk> Hi, has anyone had experience of hiring jquery designers/programmers?
[14:54:44] <ShrtSong> Odd. Had a co-worker install ie10 also, and they're having the same issue. :C
[14:55:20] <shoky> ShrtSong: it's failing on step 2?
[14:55:38] <ShrtSong> step 2?
[14:55:43] <shoky> here  https://test-cors.appspot.com/#technical
[14:55:52] <ShrtSong> No, it's just not showing anything at all.
[14:55:56] <shoky> wat
[14:55:57] <ShrtSong> For remote
[14:56:01] <ShrtSong> If I go remote test
[14:56:12] <ShrtSong> and put in http://localhost:9991/Ping/, doesn't work
[14:56:17] <ShrtSong> Local server is running
[14:56:17] <shoky> just go to that page...
[14:56:26] <ObamaAddicts> danfromuk: Make sure they are gay and hawt.
[14:56:37] <ObamaAddicts> mm
[14:56:39] <ObamaAddicts> :(
[14:56:50] <ShrtSong> Didn't fail on that page
[14:58:10] <shoky> ShrtSong: dunno.. would need to see it in action myself to help further
[14:58:59] <ShrtSong> shoky, will IE dev kit let me modify code on page to test?
[14:59:46] <ShrtSong> looks like it won't let me. :c
[15:00:08] <shoky> ShrtSong: donno whacha mean
[15:00:14] <cwatson> Can anyone help me with a basic animation? Not sure why it's not working - http://jsfiddle.net/9rcC4/1/
[15:00:54] <ShrtSong> k, so
[15:00:57] <ShrtSong> Using that provided script
[15:01:05] <ShrtSong> On that link you sent
[15:01:34] <ShrtSong> if I fire off: logged(1, 'test localhost', 'http://localhost:9991/Ping/'), it fails. :\
[15:01:43] <shoky> cwatson: you need to fix your css.  e.g. position:relative  on #game
[15:02:22] <ShrtSong> shoky, I can browse to the actual page. Like http://localhost:9991/Ping/ gives me exactly what it shoudl show, which is "0.1". but that's not what I'm getting when I use $.ajax
[15:02:28] <cwatson> shoky: Thank you. shoky++
[15:02:29] <ShrtSong> And this ONLY happens in IE. Doesn't happen in any other browser.
[15:03:04] <Bartzy> hey
[15:03:20] <Bartzy> Does Jquery animations (on 1.9) use CSS3 animations/transitions when possible ?
[15:03:36] <cwatson> shoky: I didn't mean to troll with a #CSS question. My apologies.
[15:03:58] <shoky> cwatson: np.. didnt look like a troll to me
[15:04:06] <shoky> Bartzy: no
[15:04:06] <m_gol> Danwe_WMDE: it's not documented which means it shouldn't be used. :)
[15:04:12] <cwatson> shoky: It wasn't, thanks again.
[15:04:18] <Bartzy> shoky: Why not ?
[15:04:30] <m_gol> Danwe_WMDE: it is internal jQuery structure that it behaves like an array but that's not treated as a public API
[15:04:59] <m_gol> for accessing DOM elements inside jQuery objects you should use $object.get(index), for removing/adding there are methods
[15:05:11] <m_gol> but never treat it as an array, a lot can break because of that
[15:05:56] <Danwe_WMDE> m_gol: thanks, that's all I wanted to know. Often enough you see code accessing jQuery objects that way instead of using jQuery.fn.eq etc.
[15:06:01] <Krambiorix> how can i get all form elements (input, select...) in a table row?
[15:06:52] <shoky> Bartzy: i donno the main reason(s)
[15:10:21] <ShrtSong> O-M-F-G
[15:10:22] <ShrtSong> shoky,
[15:10:24] <ShrtSong> you will not believe this
[15:10:33] <ShrtSong> Replaced localhost with 127.0.0.1
[15:10:35] <ShrtSong> boom worked
[15:10:45] <ShrtSong> wtf?!?! How does that make any sense at all?!
[15:11:05] <shoky> no idea
[15:20:51] <Bartzy> gnarf: Here perhaps? Wanted to know your thoughts on RAF in jquery?
[15:21:02] <Bartzy> gnarf: I read #9381 and just didn't get why it was removed.
[15:22:33] <janthony> I'm using jquery ticker plugin to load in items via a local XML feed. However, I am trying to get the count of the items found from the XML feed, or a callback via the jquery ticker plugin, or be able to find out what the current dom element is displaying via the ticker. Anyone familiar with the jquery ticker plugin that knows how to grab a count of the number of articles found in the xml feed?
[15:22:59] <janthony> There aren't any callback functions, so I'm wondering if I have to extend the plugin manually
[15:25:31] <GreekFreak> hi all
[15:27:35] <ShrtSong> shoky, so it worked on jsfiddle, but not my server, but I have a theory as to why...
[15:28:00] <ShrtSong> the server is https://localhost:44300.  this serves up the page with the .ajax call to http://localhost:9991
[15:28:12] <ShrtSong> the server is https, the other address is http
[15:28:24] <ShrtSong> Is there a header I need specifically for that?
[15:29:41] <GreekFreak> I used to be able to bind a function to the tabsshow event so that I can load the tab contents via ajax like this: card_tabs.bind("tabsshow", function(event, ui) {}) After a jQuery upgrade in my app this no longer works. I've tried all the events described in the API and still nothing. Any advicve would be appreciated
[15:32:27] <janthony> Any idea on how to return the count var from this plugin http://pastie.org/8032326 back to my script?
[15:33:50] <janthony> I'm trying to determine how many items were in the feed.
[15:44:55] <ShrtSong> Anyone know if it's possible to use .ajax with an http address from an https source?
[16:02:17] <davemo> ShrtSong: big security vulnerability if you do that
[16:03:30] <awc737> anyone know why this says getOptions is undefined?

[16:05:20] <awc737> i needed to return response.promise()
[16:15:50] <devslash> are jquery elements allowed to have _ or a . in the id tag ?
[16:18:50] <eddiemonge> devslash: you mean dom elements? yes
[16:19:46] <devslash> i create many elements dynamically. all the ones that have a dot in the name return [] when i do $('#myelement') in the javascript debugger in my browser

[16:21:12] <eddiemonge> devslash: how are you trying to select those elements? what selector?
[16:21:24] <eddiemonge> are you escaping those characters?
[16:21:24] <devslash> by typing $('#myelement') in the javascript debugger in my browser
[16:21:33] <devslash> i tried adding \ in front of the dot
[16:21:35] <eddiemonge> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-an-element-by-an-id-that-has-characters-used-in-css-notation/
[16:21:39] <eddiemonge> its ]]
[16:21:44] <eddiemonge> oops \\
[16:21:59] <devslash> $('foo_bar.myname')
[16:22:06] <devslash> and $('foo_bar\\.myname')
[16:22:18] <devslash> hang on
[16:25:04] <devslash> adding \\ doesnt work either
[16:26:52] <devslash> nm i figured it out
[16:26:55] <devslash> thanks for the help
[16:27:04] <eddiemonge> devslash: http://jsfiddle.net/rKJdL/
[16:29:03] <devslash> oh thanks
[16:44:59] <GreekFreak> my autocompletes stopped working after my upgrade. They were working fine until my upgrade to the latest UI
[16:45:22] <GreekFreak> have there been any major changes in that regard, cause I can't find them...
[18:03:49] <delinquentme> wondering why this isn't getting me what Im looking for: $.get('../x/get_tags.py?objClass=measurement&objId=6736').responseText
[18:04:12] <delinquentme> when I run it w/o the .responseText it gives me the whole reponse ... but with it added on ... it give me undefined
[18:06:37] <grafi> its probably not there yet then.
[18:07:12] <delinquentme> grafi, you mean the get is still running
[18:07:20] <grafi> yup
[18:07:25] <coldhead> yah it's asyncronous, that field won't be available until you are in th success callback
[18:09:31] <delinquentme> TAnKS all
[18:29:40] <verism_> hey yous guys - when a user presses a button on a touch-screen device, is there a way to reset the button so it loses its hover/active CSS rules?
[18:30:19] <verism_> preferably with the option of transitioning
[18:31:14] <coldhead> that isn't a very #jQuery question. try the good people of #css
[18:31:21] <coldhead> hey Davey!
[18:31:32] <verism_> there is no CSS way, apparently
[18:32:03] <coldhead> so that makes it jQuery's problem huh
[18:32:29] <coldhead> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5641 ?
[18:32:32] <verism_> looks that way
[18:33:25] <coldhead> they seem to think that it will be fixed (at least in jQ mobile) with the next release
[18:33:48] <coldhead> so maybe you can pick through the diff they mention in the comments and see how they do it
[18:34:22] <Davey> Hi coldhead
[18:34:44] <verism_> thank for the link
[18:34:46] <ihelpsu> test
[18:34:47] <verism_> *s
[18:36:22] <coldhead> i'm sorry snover
[18:36:49] <ihelpsu> --> hey can you send a test question on javascript (about something everyone should know) so i can see how my progress is going, thanks
[18:36:59] <willitwork> http://jsfiddle.net/mWAbx/1/  What am I forgetting here?  I've spent the past 7 hours on this.
[18:37:09] <willitwork> Any guidance would be appreciated.
[18:39:16] <coldhead> willitwork: Uncaught ReferenceError: target is not defined
[18:39:44] <coldhead> ihelpsu: http://perfectionkills.com/javascript-quiz/
[18:40:35] <ihelpsu> "not all questions are very practical" -- ill rephase
[18:40:44] <willitwork> coldhead: I must have deleted too many linesâ€¦ The issues is the options.  I can't seem to pull them in from the data* attribute.  Always get an method before initialize error
[18:40:51] <ihelpsu> --> hey can you send a test question on js (about something basic and useful everyone should know) so i can see how my progress is going, thanks
[18:41:50] <ihelpsu> im thinking i can learn enough to have a good base in a total of ~30hrs, we will see...
[18:42:03] <willitwork> ihelpsu: like a core JS or a jQuery or what?
[18:43:40] <digitalmediaguy> I am having a HECK of a time figuring out how to trigger some php with jQueryâ€¦ I have tried get and post http://jsfiddle.net/WDatQ/â€¦ Am I missing something? all I get in the inspector is that "object function has no method 'post' "
[18:44:01] <coldhead> willitwork: http://jsfiddle.net/mWAbx/3/
[18:44:10] <digitalmediaguy> I have included jQuery at the top of my page also!
[18:45:11] <coldhead> digitalmediaguy: try replacing $.post with jQuery.post
[18:45:21] <tw2113> try providing a full url to the .php file
[18:45:22] <coldhead> in case something is overwriting your $
[18:45:48] <digitalmediaguy> coldhead: I do that and I get nothing!â€¦ Will try again thoughâ€¦ was expecting something back form the data variable
[18:46:55] <willitwork> coldhead: what are you trying to point out?  The init options take an object literal.
[18:47:17] <coldhead> ihelpsu: http://jsfiddle.net/t37Pu/
[18:47:18] <ihelpsu> [20:42] <willitwork> ihelpsu: like a core JS or a jQuery or what? -- like good enough to know how to use jquery, and other basics -- for example in css, i would test someone on 'selectors' -- its basics, important and absoutely needed
[18:48:01] <ihelpsu> basically you would kow what's improtant since you're not new ;)
[18:48:11] <coldhead> willitwork: you are doing data('dialogParams') but the attr is data-dialog-params
[18:48:22] <coldhead> so i am pointing out use data('dialog-params')
[18:48:29] <coldhead> to match the actual attribute name
[18:49:02] <coldhead> ihelpsu: why not try these http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript
[18:49:16] <willitwork> yeah those are good benchmarks
[18:50:40] <digitalmediaguy> coldhead: shouldn't my code alert something regardless if the post or get comes back with dataâ€¦ when I changed my code from $.post to jQuery.post the error went awayâ€¦ but I am still expecting it to alert which it never does?
[18:51:33] <coldhead> one problem at a time baby
[18:52:22] <coldhead> digitalmediaguy: check your Network tab in your debugger
[18:52:31] <coldhead> it may be that jQuery isn't "seeing" success
[18:52:36] <coldhead> if that page returns nothing
[18:52:37] <ihelpsu> coldhead: i have all those resources on a clear learning path, i rather ask teh ppl here for one test question, ill ask when i progress more
[18:52:38] <coldhead> or an 404
[18:53:00] <coldhead> i can't think of a single TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE WITH THIS ONE WEIRD TIP question for you, ihelpsu
[18:54:06] <digitalmediaguy> rogerâ€¦ it shows up in red and says "canceled"
[18:54:11] <coldhead> digitalmediaguy: http://jsfiddle.net/WDatQ/5/
[18:54:28] <coldhead> don't use onclick
[18:54:31] <ihelpsu> i can test on a lot of topics that i know about :/ anyway, for example, in this highest rated book on amazon that i hate, it started with syntax which was garbage, and then it keeps using the term 'ecmascript' which is so unneccasry -- i dont need to know that shitt -- anyway back to learning
[18:54:32] * willitwork coldhead: jQuery renames the data once it accesses it, but renaming it didn't work.  Also jQUI 1.8 has version issues with jQ10, which is why I'm loading the library from CDN.
[18:54:35] <coldhead> use something more like this http://jsfiddle.net/WDatQ/6/
[18:54:54] <coldhead> SUPPSEDLY it renames it, willitwork, but i like to minimise magic
[18:55:04] <coldhead> name it a thing, ask for the thing you named it
[18:55:38] <coldhead> digitalmediaguy: i think your call is being cancelled because you are returning true from your onclick
[18:55:45] <coldhead> so the href in the <a> is being "followed"
[18:55:51] <coldhead> so the page navigates away
[18:55:58] <coldhead> and the ajax request in progress gets cancelled
[18:56:13] <willitwork> coldhead: Good point, which is why I tried it.  Still getting  Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method '{width:732}'  though
[18:57:46] <coldhead> willitwork: http://jsfiddle.net/mWAbx/5/
[18:57:53] <coldhead> it works better for me if i "quote" "width"
[18:57:57] <coldhead> to make it more JSONy
[18:58:06] <coldhead> then it returns an object instead of a string
[18:58:27] <coldhead> fun fact: people called Jason are not necessarily any better at JSON than average
[18:58:32] <coldhead> i learned this the hard way
[18:59:48] <coldhead> willitwork: http://jsonlint.com/
[18:59:53] <willitwork> coldhead: but dialog() isn't running on your example.
[18:59:58] <coldhead> the unquoted version isn't valid JSOn
[19:00:06] <coldhead> yes willitwork, i am fixing the bit you were having problems with
[19:00:16] <coldhead> i also took out the reference to target
[19:00:26] <coldhead> i can't rewrite all the code you deleted :P
[19:00:30] <coldhead> just trying to help you get back on track
[19:01:31] <coldhead> willitwork: i'd code it more defensively, get the options into a var and test it actually has anything in it before calling dialog(). in case the html is missing that data-* for some reason
[19:02:09] <willitwork> coldhead: tried itâ€¦ haha I shouldn't have deleted the original fiddling.  I'm going to drop the whole function in.
[19:02:37] <willitwork> Give you the big picture since you're willing to help.
[19:03:54] <coldhead> well, i WAS willing to help
[19:04:01] <coldhead> now i am thinking about different cuts of meat
[19:04:21] <coldhead> why don't you just try quoting "width" in your html in your dev version
[19:04:31] <coldhead> and only bother jsfiddle if you don't get results
[19:05:14] <digitalmediaguy> hmmmâ€¦. I removed the returns and it's still showing up as "canceled " under the network tab
[19:05:33] <coldhead> you want return false;
[19:05:38] <coldhead> but what you really want is to not use onclick
[19:05:45] <digitalmediaguy> ohâ€¦ i see
[19:05:47] <coldhead> that is how we did JS in the 80s
[19:05:48] <digitalmediaguy> whoop
[19:05:55] <coldhead> we've moved on
[19:06:11] <coldhead> some of us have moved on*
[19:07:25] <digitalmediaguy> changing that nowâ€¦ :P
[19:09:50] <willitwork> coldhead: up to version 10 now.  I don't want to do it that way becuase there are about 30 different modals on the site, and I don't want to have to write separate dialogs for each one.
[19:10:55] <lethjakman> hey, has anyone used jqtree? I'm trying to figuure out how to initialize an empty one.
[19:11:29] <willitwork> lethjakman: no, what does it do?
[19:11:42] <lethjakman> willitwork: it's just a tree plugin for jquery.
[19:11:47] <lethjakman> it's pretty nice.
[19:11:55] <lethjakman> http://mbraak.github.io/jqTree/
[19:12:05] <lethjakman> I'm looking through the documentation...there has to be a way. I'm just not seeing it.
[19:12:29] <willitwork> it formats the JSON?
[19:12:46] <lethjakman> willitwork: yeah, into a list that's drag and dropable.
[19:12:58] <lethjakman> I try initializing an empty one (incase there isn't any data) and it breaks
[19:13:28] <digitalmediaguy> now I am getting 500 (Internal Server Error)â€¦ lolâ€¦ the path looks correct to the php file in the network tab as well
[19:16:08] <lethjakman> gah, this is annoying. I don't think they allow for empty initialization.
[19:16:30] <hatoon> anyone knows an ebook or pdf jquery good for studying?
[19:16:54] <coldhead> willitwork: i didn't meant to suggest you needed separate code for each
[19:16:56] <lethjakman> hatoon: I think tutorials are definitely the best way to learn.
[19:17:05] <coldhead> all i am saying is use valid JSON in your data-whatever
[19:17:06] <lethjakman> because you really do need to do and experiment to really understand it.
[19:17:10] <coldhead> and it should Just Work
[19:17:37] <digitalmediaguy> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/QGNrK/ current code
[19:18:12] <digitalmediaguy> console showing 500 (Internal Server Error)
[19:18:15] <coldhead> digitalmediaguy: you still have return true
[19:18:22] <coldhead> which means EVERYTHING IS OKAY, FOLLOW THE LINK
[19:18:28] <coldhead> you want return false
[19:18:32] <hatoon> lethjakman Do you know any good tutorial?
[19:18:45] <coldhead> oh but if thehref is to '#' it won't matter
[19:19:06] <willitwork> coldhead: And for the other actions it does.  I'm using data('fetchParam') for the .load() and it works great.  It just seems to be dialog(), unless I'm missing something really stupid.  The code's there now, with the whole function, real HTML, and the JS console error.
[19:19:18] <coldhead> digitalmediaguy: 500 error sounds like something wrong in PHP land
[19:19:24] <coldhead> which i can't help you with
[19:20:02] <digitalmediaguy> I ditched the return trueâ€¦ yeah still showing up as error 500 argh
[19:20:25] <digitalmediaguy> Haâ€¦ and I thought it would be super easy to include a quick bit of php
[19:20:30] <coldhead> willitwork: i would try var options = $(wahatever).data('whatever-whatever'); and then console.log(options, typeof options)
[19:20:34] <coldhead> it should be an object
[19:20:52] <coldhead> session vars are a special kind of hell, digitalmediaguy
[19:21:00] <digitalmediaguy> FML
[19:21:14] <willitwork> coldhead: yup it is when I pass it as an object literal.
[19:21:31] <digitalmediaguy> Does the php have to return something to work with the .post or .get jQuery stuff?
[19:22:33] <willitwork> digitalmediaguy: it should return at least a HTTP status code.  If jQuery doesn't get any response it'll suck its thumb until the AJAX times out
[19:22:37] <digitalmediaguy> Ohâ€¦ I bet that;s itâ€¦ I am an idiotâ€¦. I prob have to have a function defined in the php file and then use some sort of .ajax data to trigger the function? seem to remember that?
[19:22:39] <lethjakman> hatoon: follow this: http://learn.jquery.com/
[19:22:57] <coldhead> willitwork: so what you are getting back from data() is not an object?
[19:22:58] <lethjakman> hatoon: it's ALWAYS best to follow the creators documentation and tutorials if you can help it. otherwise you risk it being out of date.
[19:23:08] <coldhead> because your data-whatever="value" is not valid JSON?
[19:23:15] <coldhead> because that's how it feels to me
[19:23:17] <coldhead> in my waters
[19:23:53] <willitwork> coldhead: no it's totally an object.  And I can write it as strict JSON.  The problem is when I run .dialog() it thinks the object is a method, not options.
[19:26:18] <digitalmediaguy> Noâ€¦ wasn't getting anything backâ€¦ I was literally just thinking that if I included that php it would executeâ€¦ I am an idiotâ€¦ I need to make a function with php that contains my two linesâ€¦ I believeâ€¦ then ajax thatâ€¦ I remember doing something similar a long time agoâ€¦ I think?!? arg
[19:27:21] <hatoon> thanks
[19:27:42] <coldhead> willitwork: http://jsfiddle.net/mWAbx/11/
[19:27:50] <coldhead> i think i must misunderstand
[19:35:29] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[19:37:48] <willitwork> coldhead: no worries, I'm doing a little cleanup.  You were right about the JSON part in fiddle though.  I seem to recall running on the server it's passed as an object, but it doesn't fiddle as one unless I JSON it.
[19:38:56] <willitwork> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/mWAbx/12/ Note differences between 1 and 2.  Why??
[19:40:49] <willitwork> coldhead: actually, make that 14 I just noticed a typo.  And it worksâ€¦ sigh.
[19:41:53] <coldhead> great work!
[19:41:57] <coldhead> let's never speak of this again
[19:42:28] <tw2113> i forgot already
[19:42:45] <tw2113> what did i forget?
[19:42:55] <coldhead> i can't remember
[19:42:58] <coldhead> i forget to drink
[19:43:12] <willitwork> Well, now it's back to doing what they pay me forâ€¦somehow I don't think I'm going to be billing those hours.   Thanks for your time.
[19:56:45] <coldhead> god this is bleak
[20:00:21] <coldhead> All us grip-clip samurais and safety pin street beggars
[20:01:35] * willitwork has no idea what you're talking about.
[20:06:15] <alleZSoyez> umm, hello all
[20:07:00] <willitwork> alleZSoyez: Hello yourself.
[20:07:42] <tw2113_too> yo
[20:08:03] <coldhead> good chat
[20:09:37] <willitwork> I'm going home before the trains stop.  Night all.
[20:10:15] <alleZSoyez> so I'm new to jQuery. I want to play with it but I don't know what to make with it
[20:10:43] <alleZSoyez> I never could grasp plain JavaScript so I've got even more of a learning curve
[20:12:37] <alleZSoyez> so far I made a box that changes colors when clicked, but that's about as far as I got
[20:12:47] <tw2113> a good start
[20:13:31] <alleZSoyez> I'm not sure what else to do with it. I'm only in it for gameQuery but I'm nowhere near good enough to do that sort of thing yet
[20:14:03] <tw2113> google for some tutorials that do interesting things
[20:16:13] <alleZSoyez> I tried that but came up with lists of interesting sites that use it. they're cool but no way I can do some of these advanced things
[20:16:33] <tw2113> that's why they're called "tutorials"
[20:16:35] <tw2113> they show you how
[20:16:50] <tw2113> you read and follow along and implement on your own little demo
[20:17:14] <alleZSoyez> not even tutorials, just lists. "here's a site, this is why it's cool, here's a link!"
[20:17:30] <tw2113> those are lists then, not tutorials
[20:24:27] <coldhead> alleZSoyez: why don't you do something that tracks your mouse position and leaves a trail of <div>s of various colours and sizes in your wake?
[20:25:17] <alleZSoyez> don't laugh at me but I don't own a PC. I'm doing absolutely everything on an iPod touch
[20:25:52] <coldhead> that's not funny
[20:26:31] <alleZSoyez> although I wonder if I could do something similar with touching the screen
[20:27:19] <coldhead> not easily
[20:27:28] <coldhead> why don't you try to recreate something like this http://quizyplugin.com/
[20:27:35] <coldhead> that will keep you busy for an hour at least
[20:27:45] <coldhead> and that's plenty of time for me to get drunk
[20:28:06] <tw2113> chug chug chug chug chug
[20:32:04] <alleZSoyez> hah, that's fun. I might have to. and draw cute little pictures to go with it
[20:32:46] <coldhead> adorable
[20:32:49] <coldhead> and educational!
[20:32:52] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[20:33:36] <alleZSoyez> haha. I'll get started. thanks for the suggestion :)
[20:42:52] <fender0107401> I fond an intersting thing. Loading a js file two times may cause an "$ is not defined error".
[20:43:32] <lenswipee> load it three times might correct that problem
[20:44:43] <fender0107401> I am not going to try.
[20:45:05] <coldhead> there is no try, only do
[20:45:17] <fender0107401> I spent one hour to solve this problem.
[20:46:50] <fender0107401> The answer is negative, three times also cause that error. :(
[20:48:23] <coldhead> this code will ruin $ if you load it more than once http://jsfiddle.net/wxzCg/
[20:48:50] <coldhead> if you have like that and you need to load it several times try removing that code
[20:53:13] <lenswipee> hey, I have a form loaded with ajax. The form loads and functions correctly. But when i close and reload the form the submit button function() doesn't work. I have to refresh page to get it working again. any ideas?
[20:54:17] <coldhead> i can't reproduce that in my imagination, lenswipee
[20:54:20] <coldhead> it works for me
[20:54:56] <lenswipee> coldhead: may i pm code in private for your perusal?
[20:55:34] <lenswipee> coldhead: it's OK if you're busy.
[20:56:40] <coldhead> i am a bit busy but i am also not into PMing
[20:56:43] <coldhead> except for cyber
[20:56:49] <coldhead> because then it makes me SOLE HELPER
[20:56:57] <coldhead> and i am not really good enough for that kind of responsibility
[20:57:13] <coldhead> but now that i glance at the clock i see i actually AM busy having a delicious lunch
[20:57:18] <coldhead> luckiest coldhead ever
[21:01:06] <lenswipee> coldhead: No worries. I solved the issue, but I don't understand why... not so important
[21:34:13] <alleZSoyez> dumb question but how do you do multi-dimensional arrays in JavaScript?
[21:35:03] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[21:35:19] <Eviltwin> It's remarkably similar to how you do single-dimensional arrays
[21:36:15] <Eviltwin> Also not a jQuery topic :P
[21:39:15] <coldhead> bye forever, lenswipee
[21:44:07] <spikku> I'm using UI sortable to create "binders" users can sort their "manuals" in. I am using "connectWith" so manuals can be transferred to different binders. I'm having issues adding a binder. I've tried adding it, and then re-running the entire .sortable() method, and also just using .sortable('refresh'). Am I doing it wrong?
[21:47:09] <gx> I'm trying to figure out how to parse out each <title> name/value pair from the following json: http://pastebin.ca/2395381 using $.each() ... can anyone point me in the right direction?
[21:50:27] <Eviltwin> gx: Can you at least pretty-print this for us?
[21:50:54] <Cork> gx: $.each(data['@attributes'], function(attr) { attr['@attributes'].title })
[21:51:02] <Eviltwin> Or fine, I did it for you: http://pastebin.ca/2395382
[21:51:26] <coldhead> thanks Eviltwin <3
[21:51:36] <coldhead> best man i know
[21:51:43] <Eviltwin> $.map(data.career, function (obj) { return obj.title; })
[21:51:48] <Eviltwin> Should give you all the titles
[21:51:51] <gx> sorry
[21:51:56] <gx> ok, awesome. thanks
[21:51:56] <Cork> damn forgot the career value
[21:52:11] <gx> i'm just unfamiliar with the @attributes stuff, not sure why i'm seeing that
[21:52:18] <gx> never really dealt with that before, usually i get pretty name/value pairs
[21:52:23] <Eviltwin> Keys in objects are just strings
[21:52:25] <Cork> gx: it's something from you're server
[21:52:32] <coldhead> your*
[21:52:33] <Cork> it has no meaning to json or javascript
[21:52:46] <gx> ah
[21:52:51] <Eviltwin> You can do { "{}": true } if you want
[21:53:12] <coldhead> i do want, thanks Eviltwin
[21:53:17] <Eviltwin> You're welcome
[21:53:41] <gx> thanks guys
[21:53:51] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Well I should say you can do that in jQuery
[21:53:59] <Eviltwin> Not sure if you can do that with just JavaScript though
[21:54:24] <Cork> uh... there isn't a difference so...
[21:54:57] <Cork> js> var obj = { '{}': true }; print(obj['{}']);
[21:55:01] <b-ot> Cork: true
[21:55:26] <Eviltwin> I know, just trolling
[21:55:31] <coldhead> good chat, guys
[21:55:32] <Cork> heh
[22:01:25] <gx> Eviltwin I'm still getting length = 0 using both $.each and $.map, not sure what i'm missing
[22:01:38] <godhack> hi
[22:02:20] <godhack> How do I tell another browser window that content has changed, so that it reloads the content using ajax?
[22:02:36] <godhack> "reactive interface"
[22:03:28] <gx> Cork / Eviltwin: http://pastebin.ca/2395385 gives me 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined '
[22:03:36] <Eviltwin> gx: http://jsfiddle.net/c7E8a/
[22:03:39] <sacho> if you opened the window you can communicate with it via the messaging system, or some other way(if your domains match)
[22:04:03] <Eviltwin> You may need to JSON.parse it or set your contentType correctly
[22:04:20] <Eviltwin> dataType*
[22:04:32] <gx> oh yeah, i dont have dataType on there at all
[22:04:33] <gx> derp
[22:04:54] <Eviltwin> Also data.career
[22:05:00] <Eviltwin> Not data['@attributes']
[22:05:15] <Eviltwin> And console.log(attr.title) not attr['@attributes'].title
[22:05:31] <gx> ah
[22:07:27] <gx> got it, thanks EvilTownCat
[22:07:31] <gx> Eviltwin rather
[22:07:35] <gx> too many Evil ppl in here :)
[22:11:10] <Cork> gx: my loop was broken, use Eviltwin's one
[22:11:22] <Cork> $.map(data.career, function (obj) { return obj.title; })
[22:12:20] <Cork> gx: it is obj['@attributes'].href and obj.title
[22:13:25] <godhack> That is possible without WebRTC right?
[22:13:33] <godhack> and without WebSockets
[22:14:17] <Eviltwin> godhack: Uh... what?
[22:16:02] <coldhead> godhack: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2236828/javascript-make-tabs-windows-with-same-origin-communicate/12514384#12514384
[22:17:04] <Cork> godhack: use sendMessage
[22:17:10] <Cork> ?g mdn sendMessage
[22:17:11] <b-ot> Cork: window.postMessage - Web API reference | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.postMessage
[22:17:17] <Cork> opps postMessage :D
[22:19:25] <coldhead> bots got your back
[22:19:33] <coldhead> postMessage is fun
[22:19:42] <coldhead> i like the documentation about preventing spoofing
[22:19:44] <coldhead> i never do that
[22:20:09] <Cork> coldhead: yay... that sounds like fun
[22:20:32] <godhack> Cork: well, I can't believe that this is all.  localStorage.setItem("key", "value"); var value = localStorage.getItem("key");
[22:20:55] <Cork> godhack: well it is a sucky api
[22:21:09] <Cork> godhack: and by sucky i mean REALLY sucky
[22:21:26] <coldhead> it's not that bad
[22:21:30] <godhack> Cork: oh you mean there's a listener event implemented in the browser that will know that there is a change, without me doing anything?
[22:21:31] <coldhead> y u gotta hate
[22:21:49] <Cork> its sync, it blocking, its io based, it has to be kept in memory by the browser
[22:21:53] <Cork> yes it is horrible
[22:21:55] <godhack> do you mean that by "sucky", or just that the api "sucks"
[22:22:10] <coldhead> godhack: postMessage uses a pub/sub dealy, yes
[22:22:32] <Cork> godhack: i mean it is a standard that should never have been accepted as a standard
[22:22:33] <godhack> coldhead: postMessage? eh..
[22:22:39] <Cork> it should never have been used at all
[22:23:30] <coldhead> those are all implementation problems, Cork, not the API
[22:23:49] <Cork> coldhead: yes it is the api, cause the api forces how it has to be done
[22:24:21] <Cork> coldhead: the api val = getItem() means js has to get it directly when it calls getItem
[22:24:31] <Cork> so the browser can't deffer it until it has been able to get it
[22:24:50] <Cork> witch means, the browser has to block the page on load to fetch everything from disk and store it in memory
[22:24:57] <Cork> and that is by api DESIGN
[22:25:34] <SlexAxton> beats cookies
[22:25:35] <Cork> they can risk deffering setItem() with the risk of losing it if something happens
[22:25:39] <coldhead> you've been drinking too much async kool-aid
[22:25:42] <Cork> SlexAxton: barely
[22:25:53] <Cork> indexDB is the correct solution
[22:25:58] <godhack> Cork: atomicity. you're on acid right ;)
[22:26:01] <SlexAxton> indexeddb is the answer
[22:26:42] <coldhead> i killed my dinner with karate
[22:30:40] <oojacoboo> any reason why prop("selected", true) wouldn't be working?
[22:30:48] <oojacoboo> for an option object?
[22:31:00] <Cork> use val() on the select element
[22:31:19] <Cork> or it's selectedIndex or what it was called
[22:31:55] <oojacoboo> $("select").val($("select option").prop("selected", true)); ?
[22:31:55] <coldhead> its*
[22:32:05] <oojacoboo> that's surely not right
[22:32:14] <Cork> $("select").val(<value of the option to select>);
[22:32:15] <Eviltwin> You've eliminted one of the wrong options now
[22:32:20] <oojacoboo> coldhead: ah
[22:32:30] <oojacoboo> Cork: *
[22:32:55] <oojacoboo> why doesn't select() work for this?
[22:33:01] <oojacoboo> you'd think that method would update the index
[22:33:09] <Eviltwin> ...
[22:33:12] <Eviltwin> Read it: http://api.jquery.com/select
[22:33:24] <oojacoboo> I realize that's an event handler
[22:33:29] <oojacoboo> but I also see it as a trigger
[22:33:43] <Cork> that triggers an event ya
[22:33:47] <oojacoboo> ya
[22:33:57] <oojacoboo> but it doesn't update the select
[22:34:00] <Cork> not does a dom manipulation
[22:34:04] <sacho> oojacoboo, it has nothing to do with the select element
[22:34:26] <oojacoboo> Cork: gotcha, just suggesting that maybe it could, or have an additional flag on the method
[22:34:40] <sacho> a flag for what?
[22:34:47] <Cork> oojacoboo: it's about text selection, not options
[22:34:50] <oojacoboo> to update the index for the select or not
[22:34:50] <Eviltwin> Yeah, because jQuery hasn't overloaded enough signatures
[22:34:57] <Cork> ya
[22:35:09] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: :)
[22:35:17] <Cork> oojacoboo: basically, why it is as it is, is cause that is how the dom works
[22:35:25] <sacho> That would be terribly unintuitive
[22:35:32] <oojacoboo> Cork: yea, I'm following ya
[22:35:36] <Eviltwin> Just use .val()
[22:35:45] <oojacoboo> I figured there would be a tighter coupling
[22:35:53] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: I am
[22:35:56] <oojacoboo> chill bro
[22:36:03] <Eviltwin> You only need one reasonable way to do something
[22:36:15] <Eviltwin> Adding more just means you need to know more for when you're reading other people's code
[22:36:16] <Cork> only situation where you can't use val() is for checkboxes and radio buttons
[22:36:23] <coldhead> you taling about making love?
[22:36:24] <coldhead> oh right
[22:36:27] <oojacoboo> Cork: ya
[22:37:51] <oojacoboo> Cork: the select() triggers a change event on the select?
[22:38:02] <Cork> no
[22:38:02] <oojacoboo> or does that have to be triggered another way
[22:38:10] <Cork> .change() does that
[22:38:15] <oojacoboo> cool
[22:38:20] <Cork> .select triggers a text selection event
[22:38:37] <Cork> and normally only means anything on input and textarea elements
[22:39:04] <oojacoboo> b/c you can get the change event for the select, you mean?
[22:39:09] <oojacoboo> more accurate
[22:39:19] <Cork> uh what?
[22:39:28] <oojacoboo> Cork:	 and normally only means anything on input and textarea elements
[22:39:30] <Eviltwin> .select() isn't tied to <select> elements
[22:39:41] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: thanks man, I realize that
[22:40:10] <coldhead> good chat guys, let's all take a short break
[22:40:18] <oojacoboo> can you not $("option").select() ?
[22:40:21] <Eviltwin> You just said "the select() triggers a change event on the select?"
[22:40:21] * SlexAxton grabs coffee
[22:40:23] <oojacoboo> is that not a valid trigger?
[22:40:36] <Eviltwin> You cannot
[22:40:42] <Cork> oojacoboo: .select() is for T-E-X-T selection
[22:40:51] <Cork> it has nothing to do with option or select elements
[22:40:52] <Eviltwin> I mean you can, it just doesn't do anything useful
[22:41:01] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: yea
[22:41:31] <Cork> oojacoboo: when a user selects some characters in a text, the select event is triggered
[22:41:53] <Cork> oojacoboo: when you want to make the content of an input element selected you call .select()
[22:42:04] <Cork> except for that it has no use
[22:42:26] <oojacoboo> I mean, it just seems funny to me I have to change the value of the option, set the prop of the option to selected, and then trigger the change event for the option, just to give the effect of a new option selected within a select
[22:42:48] <sacho> oojacoboo, http://jsfiddle.net/UqFeh/
[22:43:04] <Cork> oojacoboo: option elements doesn't have any state, the select element is the element that keeps that state
[22:43:13] <Cork> oojacoboo: that is why it works like that
[22:43:15] <sacho> oojacoboo, or you could just use .val()
[22:43:32] <oojacoboo> sacho: yea, I see, thanks
[22:43:39] <Eviltwin> I don't think you need to do that first part
[22:44:03] <sacho> the first part?
[22:44:10] <oojacoboo> the prop("selected", false);
[22:44:13] <oojacoboo> not needed
[22:44:15] <Eviltwin> You can drill down to this if you want: http://jsfiddle.net/Xhf88/
[22:44:50] <oojacoboo> anyway, thanks for clearing that up guys
[22:45:05] <sacho> eh, the .eq() will only work in this specific case :p
[22:45:36] <sacho> oojacoboo, so even setting selected works. Maybe there was a bug in your code.
[22:45:40] <Eviltwin> You just need to select the <option> you want selected and do a .prop('selected', true) on it
[22:45:49] <Eviltwin> I think he got that
[22:45:58] <Eviltwin> And understand the use of .eq() here
[22:46:33] <Cork> i'm not sure how cross browser that is though
[22:47:09] <Cork> some browsers (namely ie) used to treat select boxes as native comboboxes in windows
[22:47:34] <oojacoboo> if you set prop("selected", true) on one option, will it automatically unset the others?
[22:47:37] <oojacoboo> I'm guessing now
[22:47:40] <oojacoboo> not*
[22:47:49] <sacho> I don't know, which is why I was unsetting the rest first.
[22:47:54] <Eviltwin> Depends on whether it allows multiple selections or not
[22:47:55] <Cork> oojacoboo: depends on if the select element can have more then one element selected
[22:47:56] <oojacoboo> sacho: yea
[22:48:07] <oojacoboo> cool
[22:48:18] * sacho checks the spec
[22:48:39] <Cork> sacho: make sure to check the dom spec and not the html spec then
[22:49:04] <Eviltwin> Cork: The way that .val() set values for <select> is via element.selected = /*bool*/
[22:49:13] <Eviltwin> On the <option>
[22:50:14] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: are you saying that it uses an identifier instead?
[22:50:33] <oojacoboo> references the option object
[22:50:35] <sacho> a wat?
[22:50:51] <Cork> Eviltwin: where do you see this?
[22:50:57] <Cork> like 2258 this.value = val;
[22:51:04] <Cork> line
[22:51:33] <sacho> Cork, check the value hooks.
[22:52:03] <sacho> you can have value hooks for different elements which define a get() and set() interface
[22:52:23] <Eviltwin> Cork: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes.js#L279
[22:52:27] <oojacoboo> sacho: so this means the change event doesn't need manually firing, right
[22:52:34] <Cork> Eviltwin: hmm true
[22:52:51] <Cork> Eviltwin: oh, well at least we know it works now days :)
[22:54:05] <Eviltwin> In fact I just pulled up 1.7.1 and it used to not do anything but set the .selected properties: http://pastebin.com/GxQ5aRTU
[22:54:14] <Eviltwin> (unless you were setting it to nothing selected)
[22:54:56] <sacho> pretty sure an onchange event shouldn't be fired if you just set the .selected property.
[22:55:14] <oojacoboo> sacho: checking
[22:55:29] <sacho> since onchange requires focus loss
[22:56:24] <digitalmediaguy> Questionâ€¦ Anyone know anything about keeping an .ajax call in the current session of a CMS? I have been trying to execute some php that sets a session variable today unsuccessfullyâ€¦ Every time the ajax load the php file everything worksâ€¦ except the session variable that gets set isn't in the current session for my cmsâ€¦ Joomla :-./
[22:57:50] <sacho> digitalmediaguy, unless for some obscure reason the browser isn't sending cookies with the request, which you can check with your browser's developer tools, your problem is server side
[22:58:38] <Cork> Eviltwin: depends on how far back you look ;) https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.1/src/jquery/jquery.js#L1041
[22:58:45] <Cork> but ya, it has been stable for ages
[22:59:07] <Eviltwin> I believe that's from before it worked with <select>?
[23:00:10] <coldhead> digitalmediaguy: i'd blame joomla, in that it makes everything terrible
[23:00:16] <digitalmediaguy> lol
[23:00:20] <digitalmediaguy> That's real
[23:02:18] <digitalmediaguy> Ajax gets the phpâ€¦ executesâ€¦ alerts callback dataâ€¦ but the sessions that are set are not in the current sessionâ€¦ this does make sense right? got to be it!â€¦ I print the variable in php at the top of the viewâ€¦ its trueâ€¦ I then ajax to my php to set it to falseâ€¦ it alerts falseâ€¦ then I refresh the page and its back to @#$% true at the top
[23:02:39] <digitalmediaguy> that is cray right?â€¦. shouldn't be happeningâ€¦ it's joomla's damn session handler?
[23:02:59] <Eviltwin> Sounds like a server-side issue to me
[23:03:14] <digitalmediaguy> roger
[23:03:16] <digitalmediaguy> fml
[23:03:40] <coldhead> it's all too easy to blame the serverside when joomla is involved
[23:03:44] <coldhead> and that's what i like about it
[23:03:52] <coldhead> just sitting here, rocking back and forth, blaming the server
[23:28:09] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/UqFeh/5/
[23:28:23] <oojacoboo> anyone with clues as to why that's working in this fiddle, but not in my codebase?
[23:28:31] <oojacoboo> it's a copy paste
[23:29:17] <Cork> oojacoboo: do you have it wrapped in .ready on your page?
[23:29:24] <oojacoboo> Cork: yes
[23:29:50] <oojacoboo> it's on a quite complex ajax ui which all works just fine
[23:30:10] <Eviltwin> Have you tried using jQuery Lint?
[23:30:10] <Cork> and $("#add-new-profile-option").length > 0 ?
[23:30:12] <oojacoboo> the click even fires
[23:30:16] <oojacoboo> event*
[23:30:19] <Eviltwin> Or more simply what Cork says
[23:30:35] <Eviltwin> this.innerHTML is a little :|
[23:30:45] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: yea yea
[23:31:00] <Cork> oojacoboo: also please don't abuse links
[23:31:08] <oojacoboo> links?
[23:31:11] <Cork> <a>
[23:31:22] <Cork> if you don't want a link use a span with css styles
[23:31:32] <Cork> (and tabindex="0")
[23:31:46] <Cork> href="#" is a hack needed for ie<6
[23:31:53] <oojacoboo> that sounds like a very js thing to say
[23:31:55] <oojacoboo> but w/e
[23:32:03] <oojacoboo> Cork: I realize that
[23:32:07] <Eviltwin> And why are yoy filtering someting you just selected by ID?
[23:32:12] <oojacoboo> this was also originally written over 3 years ago
[23:32:22] <Cork> oojacoboo: well if you used <a href="none-js-based-url-that-does-that-same-thing"> i would totally agree
[23:32:24] <Eviltwin> And then mutating the elements
[23:32:29] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you meant .each
[23:32:38] <Cork> but right now you have a broken link with a js strapped on
[23:32:48] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: just trying to set the option to that value
[23:32:59] <oojacoboo> I guess I don't exactly know what filter() does
[23:33:10] <Eviltwin> Have you read the API page for it?
[23:33:48] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: yea, not really what I need
[23:34:34] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: but it seems that it triggers a change of val for the option
[23:34:45] <oojacoboo> I guess you'd have to do it manually otherwise
[23:37:46] <coldhead> i demand satisfaction
[23:39:55] <oojacoboo> omg, I was adding it under the wrong modal, fml
[23:41:38] <coldhead> hahahahhaha
[23:41:40] <coldhead> >: |
[23:41:52] <oojacoboo> ><
[23:42:02] <oojacoboo> clearly time to leave the office
[23:42:50] <coldhead> if you can wait half an hour, oojacoboo, i'll leave with you
[23:42:58] <oojacoboo> ha
[23:43:00] <coldhead> but ONLY FOR ONE DRINK
[23:43:09] <coldhead> or my wife will suspect
[23:43:10] <oojacoboo> ;)
[23:49:40] <coldhead> sardonism
