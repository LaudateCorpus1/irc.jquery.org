[01:41:04] <larsk> Hey everybody. I am using this plugin: http://danartinho.github.io/WSlot/ (it's like the ios date picker). Can some give me a hint how to change the font size to bold for the selected element
[01:46:33] <larsk> i managed it! ;)
[01:48:09] <jak2000> how to?
[01:48:48] <larsk> i will write it in my own githu issue ;) was just a little css fix
[01:49:00] <jak2000> share
[01:49:00] <jak2000> pls
[01:53:18] <jak2000> ?

[04:00:01] <profsimm> So .attr(name) reads an attribute, and .attr(name, val) sets an attribute right?  How can I 1) remove an attribute  2) get all attributes
[04:07:30] <pinkisntwell> is there a way of safely using selectors without having to use document.ready()? my problem is that document.ready() can take a few moments to run and so content briefly flashes on the screen
[04:11:06] <profsimm> pinkisntwell: there are few ways to resolve this.
[04:11:31] <profsimm> pinkisntwell: one is to move your script from document.ready() in the header, to a script block right before </html> and see if this helps
[04:11:52] <profsimm> pinkisntwell: second is not to show content you don't want to show :-) make the default style/content something palatable.
[04:12:04] <profsimm> pinkisntwell: which if you tell me more, I can tell you how
[04:13:07] <pinkisntwell> profsimm: thanks, so there is no way to safely avoid document.ready() altogether when you know that you are only interested in one element? Say that I have an HTML element, if I put a <script> tag right after the element won't the script always be able to find the element before it?
[04:42:06] <Cork> profsimm: there isn't a way to get all attributes as far as i remember, for removing there is removeAttr
[04:42:24] <Cork> profsimm: also note though most of the times you don't want attr() but prop()
[04:42:32] <Cork> and you can get all properties
[04:43:32] <Cork> ah right there is .prop('attributes')
[04:43:38] <Cork> so yes you can get all attributes
[04:48:17] <profsimm> Cork: hm
[05:00:31] <nikio_> the reason i like jqm is because its not that hybrid partially native bs, but just a mobile web app
[05:01:02] <nikio_> the reason i like jqm is because its not that hybrid partially native bs, but just a mobile web app programming language
[05:09:06] <Cork> nikio_: it isn't a language but a framework
[05:09:13] <Cork> the language is still javascript :)
[05:09:15] <nikio_> yep
[05:09:21] <nikio_> but you get the point
[05:09:33] <Cork> not sure why you make the statement, but ok
[05:09:39] <nikio_> i looked into ionic and onsen
[05:10:02] <nikio_> some fools were trying to compare it to jqm.. saying jqm is dead
[05:10:19] <nikio_> but those are supposed to be hybrid frameworks :/
[08:45:12] <TViernion> Morning everyone
[08:53:01] <hellyeah> #javascript
[09:12:15] <sigdk> I apply a footable (https://fooplugins.com/plugins/footable-jquery/)  to a table... in chrome it works fine. In IE 11 I get a message "footable method is not supported by your object"  -  or something like that (I have access only to a german version of IE)
[09:12:17] <sigdk> any hint?
[09:13:23] <Cork> sigdk: is that just a message or do you get a stacktrace or a line reference?
[09:13:38] <Cork> else you will prob have to read through the plugins source
[09:15:27] <sigdk> Cork, http://i.imgur.com/jCsnZ5h.png
[09:15:57] <Cork> ah, lovely
[09:16:02] <sigdk> :)
[09:16:06] <Cork> ya, i've been there ie error codes sucks
[09:16:43] <Cork> you will have to run with a unminified version of the plugin and debug step through the code and see where it throws uå
[09:16:45] <Cork> *up
[09:17:10] <sigdk> Cork, and then what? fix the plugin?
[09:17:19] <Cork> or file a bug ya
[09:17:36] <Cork> it might be a bug in what you run it on too
[09:17:50] <Cork> but you won't be able to tell before you find why it throws the error :)
[09:28:17] <silencer_> Hey guys, I need to write a simple JS / app to register people at a event
[09:28:46] <silencer_> Was thinking the best way to do it would be via Html with Jquery writing/reading to a text file
[09:29:43] <Cork> silencer_: you need server execution one way or another
[09:29:44] <silencer_> Anyone tried something similaar?
[09:29:58] <Cork> cause js can't write to the server
[09:30:14] <silencer_> Hmm.. I would be a bit afraid of the delay of using server execution..
[09:30:20] <silencer_> Doh
[09:30:28] <Cork> uh
[09:30:28] <silencer_> Of course it can't.. hmm
[09:30:39] <silencer_> So a PHP page or something similar would probably be better
[09:30:51] <Cork> yes
[09:30:58] <Cork> you will have to have it either way
[09:31:03] <Cork> unless you are ok with storing it in the browser
[09:31:42] <Cork> (witch would only work if the page was for a kiosk or something like that)
[11:09:04] <amosbird> hi, how can I init jquery inside nodejs?
[11:10:47] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1801160/can-i-use-jquery-with-node-js#4129032
[11:15:04] <Es0teric> question -- i get this error: on ajax return Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : but i have something like this: {"message":"test"} why is that?
[11:15:44] <taplar> does it make the request?
[11:16:22] <Es0teric> what do you mean?
[11:16:36] <taplar> in your network console, do you see the out going request?
[11:16:41] <Es0teric> no
[11:16:44] <Es0teric> not on XHR
[11:16:56] <taplar> can you show the entire script logic?
[11:17:00] <taplar> *ajax
[11:17:25] <Es0teric> does it matter if i put it on kopy.io?
[11:17:34] <taplar> not really
[11:17:49] <taplar> *vs other places.  just don't paste it in here
[11:19:17] <Es0teric> taplar https://kopy.io/Nplip
[11:19:19] <Es0teric> thats the logic
[11:20:56] <taplar> and you don't see the request?
[11:21:02] <Es0teric> nope
[11:21:06] <taplar> i'm not sure that jsonp would show up as an xhr
[11:21:13] <taplar> check your normal requests
[11:21:59] <Es0teric> taplar yeah
[11:22:02] <Es0teric> its a normal request
[11:22:03] <Es0teric> i found it
[11:22:08] <taplar> is the response valid json?
[11:22:15] <Es0teric> yeah
[11:22:24] <taplar> can you post the network response to that request?
[11:22:32] <Es0teric> taplar {"message":"test"}
[11:23:31] <amosbird> Hi, how can I fix this error Error: Cross origin null forbidden ?
[11:24:14] <taplar> Es0teric: looks fine then.  not sure what the issue you're running into
[11:24:22] <Es0teric> taplar i just said it
[11:24:35] <taplar> but the fact that it made the requests successfully suggests that the response is not in the correct format
[11:24:51] <Es0teric> taplar how do i make it do a xhr request then?
[11:24:58] <Es0teric> it doesnt make sense taht its making it as a regular one
[11:24:59] <taplar> don't do jsonp
[11:25:05] <Es0teric> i didnt
[11:25:06] <taplar> sure it does
[11:25:15] <taplar> dataType: 'jsonp',
[11:25:19] <Es0teric> i just tried it
[11:25:21] <Es0teric> taplar clearly i changed it
[11:25:32] <taplar> how is that 'clearly'?
[11:25:38] <taplar> i can only go off your share dude
[11:25:43] <Es0teric> [11:24 AM] •  « taplar »	don't do jsonp
[11:25:43] <Es0teric> [11:25 AM] •  « Es0teric »	i didnt
[11:25:49] <Es0teric> context
[11:25:52] <taplar> but your post has dataType: 'jsonp',
[11:25:53] <taplar> in it
[11:25:56] <Es0teric> so?
[11:26:12] <Es0teric> if you said "dont do jsonp" and i said "i didnt" contextually it means i updated my code
[11:26:31] <taplar> which you hadn't said you did
[11:26:44] <Es0teric> i said i didnt
[11:26:48] <taplar> after the fact
[11:26:56] <Es0teric> which validates it more
[11:27:04] <Es0teric> either way
[11:27:17] <Es0teric> i dont have jsonp
[11:27:22] <Es0teric> and it still is doing it as a normal request, not XHR
[11:28:03] <taplar> you took out the dataType, refreshed the page, and the request is now not showing in the XHR filter?
[11:30:04] <Es0teric> it wasnt showing there in the first place taplar
[11:30:13] <taplar> right, because of the jsonp
[11:30:21] <Es0teric> yeah
[11:30:27] <taplar> which if you remove, i would expect it to show in the xhr
[11:30:32] <Es0teric> right.. but it doesnt
[11:30:46] <taplar> share your latest code?
[11:31:17] <Es0teric> its the same thing... just take out line 5
[11:31:21] <Es0teric> thats the only thing i changed
[11:31:57] <taplar> then i don't see a reason why it wouldn't be an xhr, going off that share
[11:32:25] <taplar> it's syntatically valid
[11:32:56] <Es0teric> if i use .post() instead would it do the same thing?
[11:33:03] <Es0teric> .post() is just a wrapper for $.ajax() right?
[11:33:08] <taplar> yep
[11:33:17] <Es0teric> damn
[11:34:47] <taplar> for shiggles, try giving it a dataType: 'text'
[11:42:48] <Es0teric> ok
[11:43:23] <Es0teric> taplar same thing
[11:43:31] <taplar> :s
[11:44:07] <taplar> not sure then
[11:49:26] <Harry_> how do i find the last occurrence of a word in div?
[12:05:31] <Es0teric> @taplar this issue might be a chrome thing
[12:05:43] <Es0teric> but thats an even bigger problem now.. because firefox does not show that error
[12:06:18] <taplar> did you double check that firefox has all the logging enabled?
[12:09:49] * taplar_lunch zombie walks out for a bit
[12:12:10] <Es0teric> question -- i get this error: on ajax return Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : but i have something like this: {"message":"test"} why is that?
[12:12:16] <Es0teric> damn i didnt mean to post that
[12:12:17] <Es0teric> =_=
[12:34:36] <sigdk> can I extract all the css properties of an object?
[12:35:03] <sigdk> get a json maybe with everything
[12:36:27] <taplar_lunch> maybe look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6338217/get-a-css-value-with-javascript#6338234
[14:15:28] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeee
[14:15:37] <taplar> all day
[14:15:57] <robertmaxrees> erry day
[14:35:28] <tsukasadt> Okay, I'm pulling my hair out trying to figure out how to determine the largest acceptable font-size to prevent content from taking up a third line. I got it working standalone (onload the code runs and the font-size/line-height is set properly), but if I set the function to run on resize, it breaks in ways I don't understand. Just adding the eventListener is causing the onload calculations to break. Could someone identify for me
[14:35:28] <tsukasadt> what I'm missing? https://jsfiddle.net/50pzwufb/
[14:36:46] <tsukasadt> I have the line (47) that adds the function to an eventListener commented out.
[14:38:20] <taplar> wouldn't the resize need to call titleResize() ?
[14:38:27] <taplar> err, titleSize()
[14:39:22] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/50pzwufb/1/ ?
[14:39:41] <tsukasadt> I don't think so. I put the resizeTitles() segment in it's own function to avoid having to redetermine which title is the longest.
[14:40:17] <taplar> ok, then you need to stick it in a function
[14:40:33] <tsukasadt> taplar, resize your version to see the same issue on the resizing.
[14:40:38] <taplar> $(window).resize(function(){ resizeTitles(largest); });
[14:41:09] <tsukasadt> Oh, I feel so stupid.
[14:41:32] <taplar> that may not fix your issue, but that's the proper usage of it
[14:42:42] <tsukasadt> It fixed the onload execution, but now it's the same as if I had set the titleSize to run, instead.
[14:44:42] <taplar> what exactly is it supossed to be resizing?
[14:45:43] <tsukasadt> The intent is to keep the font-size as large as possible without exceeding font-size 18px or needing more than 2 lines. I haven't adding the 18px restriction because I wanted to get the resizing working.
[14:46:14] <taplar> it's setting the font size to 0.9px for me
[14:46:28] <taplar> i had to inspect it to see what the text was.  i thought it was just some "..." on the blocks
[14:46:46] <taplar> so you got some other issues, :)
[14:47:33] <taplar> ah, it started out right, but then went super small
[14:48:03] <tsukasadt> So, it takes the line-height and font-size to calculate the total height of 2 lines and then test increasing font-size by .1 until the height exceeds the calculated height of 2 lines, then it reverses to get the largest possible font-size.
[14:49:33] <tsukasadt> Adding a font-size cap is the easy part, so I wanted to get the resizing working, but you see what's happening.
[14:52:53] <tsukasadt> I've tried to think of other ways to do this, but I haven't been successful in my attempts to do so. :(
[14:55:17] <taplar> have you considered having the full text as like an alt or a title, and truncating the value?
[14:55:59] <tsukasadt> Yeah, but the suggestion was rejected.
[14:57:24] <taplar> hah
[14:57:34] <taplar> dude, you are doing parseInt in the getFontSize
[14:57:53] <taplar> well, you are, but i also made a syntax error so it stopped working, blah
[14:57:54] <tsukasadt> Yeah, the decimal is ignored by the browser.
[14:58:34] <tsukasadt> Sorry, I have a meeting I have to get to. ty for looking at it, I'll be back as soon as I can.
[15:11:19] <taplar> heh, killed my chrome playing with that guy
[15:45:55] <tsukasadt> taplar, I'm back. Did you have any luck with it?
[15:46:08] <taplar> still poking
[15:46:40] <tsukasadt> Drats, I thought that you'd have it completely rewritten with half the size by now, you're so good! xD
[15:49:33] <taplar> BOOM
[15:50:02] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/50pzwufb/2/
[15:50:03] <tsukasadt> You blew it up? xD
[15:50:12] <taplar> the issue was you were setting inline css on the elements
[15:50:29] <taplar> this was causing the values to not update natually as the font size and line height grew/dwindled
[15:50:37] <taplar> so i cleared out the style prop before the looping
[15:55:05] <tsukasadt> title.prop('style', '');
[15:55:09] <tsukasadt> That's all I needed!?
[15:55:09] <taplar> yup
[15:55:16] <taplar> looks like it
[15:55:24] <tsukasadt> *facepalm*
[15:55:32] <taplar> i also moved the binding into the method as a one() for some poor man throttling
[15:56:17] <tsukasadt> Wouldn't that add new eventListeners everytime the window resizes?
[15:56:29] <taplar> one() unbinds after it happens
[15:56:50] <taplar> but yes, it's binding and unbinding
[15:56:52] <tsukasadt> Ah, I missed that.
[15:57:11] <tsukasadt> Is there really any benefit to doing to that way, though?
[15:57:16] <taplar> a better approach would be to find an actual jquery throttle/debounce plugin, or use one that's in like lodash
[15:57:35] <taplar> multiple resizes can trigger together, you could potentially be stepping on yourself
[15:57:47] <taplar> doing too much work, etc.
[15:57:55] <tsukasadt> I'm afraid that's out of the question. I'm limited to jQuery 1.7.2. We have no control over the libraries.
[15:58:10] <tsukasadt> Ah, I see what you mean.
[15:58:13] <taplar> ok, so that should help a little with the throttling then
[15:58:44] <tsukasadt> I suppose I should set that for the fixedHeight function, too.
[15:59:15] <taplar> oh, yeah, probably
[15:59:45] <taplar> and any lookups that you do in those methods that you can extract? +++++++
[15:59:48] <tsukasadt> Geez, though, I never would've thought of this solution. xD
[16:00:34] <taplar> it was throwing me off, i was console logging your values and the height wasn't changing
[16:00:40] <taplar> i was like wtf, until i saw it
[16:01:23] <tsukasadt> I love it when I have an issue and you step in to troubleshoot it. You always find a solution. :)
[16:01:35] <taplar> ohh, don't jinx me
[16:01:46] <tsukasadt> No jinx, purely praise!
[16:03:24] <taplar> brb, i need a walk about
[16:09:04] <taplar> mmmmm, ok
[16:09:08] <taplar> err, oj
[16:09:17] <taplar> i can't type today
[16:22:41] <tsukasadt> taplar, got a new problem-ish. I'm sure it's just my logic, but I added the font-size restrictions and it isn't working so well with the minimum restriction. Rather, the restrictions are, but the application of the hide class is being weird. :S https://jsfiddle.net/50pzwufb/3/
[16:24:15] <Es0teric> if a request returns false on success which method does $.ajax() use to handle that?
[16:25:19] <taplar> it all depends on the status code
[16:25:22] <tsukasadt> Es0teric, what do you mean by it returns "false"? Is the XHR literally retrieving a responseText of "false" or is it erring?
[16:25:33] <Es0teric> tsukasadt success: false
[16:25:37] <Es0teric> thats what the object has
[16:25:51] <taplar> that doesn't matter for the request
[16:26:10] <taplar> the request goes off of the response code.  200-300 are ok, anything else is typically error
[16:26:19] <Es0teric> alright so yeah it does give a 200 response
[16:26:36] <tsukasadt> Then it'll process done() and always().
[16:26:41] <Es0teric> ok
[16:26:42] <Es0teric> thanks
[16:28:19] <taplar> tsukasadt: you know that part of the text is outside that unitTitle, right?
[16:29:16] <taplar> like "Unit 2" is unwrapped text with the unitTitle being the following sibling
[16:29:27] <tsukasadt> The idea is that if the font-size needs to be smaller than 12px to display the longest title on 2-lines or less, that the title would just be hidden.
[16:29:36] <taplar> ah
[16:29:58] <taplar> so what's the issue?  the flickering?
[16:30:52] <tsukasadt> Yeah, but I'm not too concerned about that. The bigger concern for me is that half the time a resize stops it's has the title displayed when it should be hidden.
[16:31:08] <tsukasadt> it has*
[16:37:01] <tsukasadt> I'm certain it's my logic, I just can't figure out what about it is wrong. :S
[16:37:22] <taplar> some reason the fontsize is bouncing between a value of 11 and 122
[16:38:00] <tsukasadt> I've updated it to use variables declaring max and min font-sizes: https://jsfiddle.net/50pzwufb/4/
[16:39:13] <tsukasadt> We know the calculations all work, I didn't change them. All I did was add an override after the calculations to override the calculated values if they are out-of-bounds.
[16:39:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/50pzwufb/5/ same thing
[16:39:52] <taplar> something in the logic is making it think the font size should be 122
[16:40:17] <taplar> mmm, 12 * 1.1 would be 122
[16:40:24] <taplar> wait, no
[16:40:29] <taplar> but that is odd
[16:40:45] <tsukasadt> On my console, it is jumping between 8 and 64. :S
[16:43:40] <tsukasadt> If you comment out the if statement, it works exactly as expected. Could it be that I need to save the title.getFontSize() to a variable before testing the value and overriding it?
[16:44:36] <tsukasadt> Nope, that changed nothing.
[16:45:21] <tsukasadt> I think I know!
[16:45:42] <tsukasadt> I think it's the hide class altering the required space to render the text.
[16:46:41] <taplar> yeah, that looks like it
[16:52:00] <tsukasadt> I'm trying to add if(hidden) but it keeps erring that .find(...).hasClass() is not a function. xD
[16:53:27] <tsukasadt> It's literally a copy/paste of the if statement further down the code. xD
[16:54:16] <tsukasadt> Go figure, if I type it manually it works. xD
[16:55:00] <tsukasadt> So, taplar, that was it: https://jsfiddle.net/50pzwufb/6/
[16:55:14] <tsukasadt> Works perfectly, now. tyvm for the help. :)
[17:07:21] <tsukasadt> Okay...superflaw, it murders IE. xD
[17:07:28] <taplar> heh
[17:08:00] <taplar> superflaw?  superawesmome
[17:08:20] <tsukasadt> Literally, just ripped out what remained of it's guts and let the blood puddle all around.
[17:08:27] <tsukasadt> Yeah, well, you know what I mean!
[17:08:31] <taplar> ya
[17:09:18] <tsukasadt> Kills it even if the resize isn't a click-and-drag, but just the maximize button. Hmmm...
[17:10:12] <taplar> well, lets see
[17:12:34] <tsukasadt> Edge is laggy, but it doesn't completely stop like IE. Hmmm...
[17:12:49] <taplar> i'm playing
[17:13:01] <tsukasadt> lol
[17:13:10] <tsukasadt> Got it. Leave you be. xD
[17:17:22] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/50pzwufb/7/
[17:17:33] <taplar> changed it to be more of a debounce
[17:17:39] <taplar> might be easier on the IE
[17:18:03] <taplar> you can adjust the 'delayTime' to make it react faster
[17:20:48] <tsukasadt> I see, you setup a setTimeout(), but it still seems to be locking up IE and Safari. Hmmm.
[17:20:55] <taplar> man
[17:21:36] <robertmaxrees> can always use the profiler.
[17:22:01] <tsukasadt> Is it possible to have it listen to when a resize is finished?
[17:22:29] <robertmaxrees> that's what a debounce is for.
[17:23:11] <tsukasadt> Except that using setTimeout() is best guess. If you click-and-drag, trying to find that perfect size, it's going to keep going and going and going.
[17:23:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:23:40] <taplar> it will react when you stop sure
[17:23:45] <taplar> but consider the use case
[17:23:56] <taplar> are your users going to be sitting there tweaking their size all the time?
[17:23:59] <taplar> nah
[17:25:26] <taplar> and moving any selectors out of the functionality, like i mentioned earlier, will increase your efficiency here
[17:25:27] <tsukasadt> I understand, but it's crashing from just doing the maximize button.
[17:26:53] <taplar> do your units exists on page load?
[17:27:03] <tsukasadt> Yes.
[17:27:20] <taplar> so you could look them up in your doc ready, cache them, and use that instead of looking them up each time
[17:27:27] <taplar> same with your unitTitles and etc
[17:27:50] <taplar> repetitive look ups really bite you when you are dealing with event handlers like scroll or resize that fire a ton
[17:28:21] <taplar> throttle/debounce helps, but nothing can beat a good cache
[17:28:38] <taplar> imho
[17:30:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:32:56] <diverdude> How do i do in javascript what i do in jquery like this v = $('input[value="orderNumber"]') ?
[17:33:08] <taplar> ##javascript
[17:33:11] <robertmaxrees> ")
[17:33:13] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[17:34:40] <taplar> oh noe.  i just realized i go on call next week, >(
[17:42:23] <goodenough> Do you guys store info using .data() or .attr()? Using .data is really confusing and hard to keep track of
[17:42:35] <taplar> we use data
[17:43:07] <taplar> if you are talking about element info that doesn't already have a standard attribute
[17:44:22] <goodenough> i see
[17:47:00] <robertmaxrees> goodenough what about it makes it confusing?
[17:47:55] <goodenough> im looking at the element in chrome, and the data doesnt change in the html when I set it to a new one
[17:48:37] <goodenough> when i do some thing like $($0).data('link'); it does show that its changed
[17:48:55] <taplar> because data() stores the values in an internal cache
[17:49:07] <taplar> it doesn't update the dom
[17:50:28] <goodenough> i see, i never understood that
[17:51:04] <taplar> slightly annoying from a developer standpoint, but from a machine standpoint it's faster and it doesn't matter if you can see it.  your pc can, :P
[17:53:30] <goodenough> yea im a visual kinda guy, oh well
[17:53:37] <tsukasadt> taplar and robertmaxrees, I did as yall suggested and even wrote a little jQuery extension for delaying the execution of a resize eventListener until there is a length of 1 second where the window width and height are unchanged, but it's still crashing iE: https://jsfiddle.net/50pzwufb/9/
[17:55:02] <tsukasadt> I'm going to call it quits for today. I just wanted to let yall know before I did. ty for all the help. :)
[17:58:26] <webley> tsukasadt: well, maybe you want to try out a MutationObserver
[17:58:31] <webley> :)
[17:59:24] <tsukasadt> webley, Could you send me info on that to check out over the weekend?
[17:59:30] <TimCoal> anyone know of a good framework for diagramming with canvas or similar?
[18:04:53] <robertmaxrees> mutatuinobserver won't solve his problem tho.
[18:05:52] <robertmaxrees> TimCoal what about https://www.jgraph.com/ ?
[18:15:10] <royal_screwup21> In reference to sokcetio, what does it mean when a user "disconnects" from a chatapp? Context: I've built a rudimentary chat app where users can log in and chat real time. Now when someone disconnects, I want to be able to display message saying that "user x" has disconnected. I looked the docs https://socket.io/get-started/chat/  and I read about
[18:15:10] <royal_screwup21> socket.on("disconnect, function(){); I tried implementing it and it didn't work. I kept 2 tabs connected to the chat app, and closed one tab. It didn't get reflected on my console.log, which was supposed to print some stuff out when the "disconnect" event was activated. Where am I going wrong?
[18:16:25] <robertmaxrees> royal_screwup21 you'll have much more luck with ##javascript :)
[18:18:20] <taplar> i think you are misunderstanding where that disconnect happens
[18:20:34] <goodenough> taplar: lets say i set an elements data like $('.thing').data('power', 1).  How would i find that element with that data? $('body').find([data-power="1"]) wouldnt work since data is not on the dom
[18:23:08] <goodenough> looks like theres a .filterByData function someone wrote here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4191386/jquery-how-to-find-an-element-based-on-a-data-attribute-value
[18:37:15] <robertmaxrees> goodenough there's .filter()
[18:37:45] <robertmaxrees> $('.thing').filter(function() { return $(this).data('power') === 1});
[18:39:31] <goodenough> thanks, i was about to use .each()
[18:44:23] <taplar> heh, the filter by data does the filter
[18:46:38] <robertmaxrees> hah
[18:49:31] <taplar> oh the day when more people start using models
[18:54:31] <taplar> hasta luego
[19:29:33] <foo> I'm trying to add jquery UI to a website so I can style my tooltips but I'm getting this error: https://screencast.com/t/NDPDpJL9fmLD - with this guide: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/ - what's strange is it works fine if I copy/paste this code offline, but as soon as I stick it on this dev site I'm working on it doesn't work. Granted, there is a lot of other code on that site but still... seems strange
[19:29:40] <foo> Any two cents?
[19:30:37] <robertmaxrees> foo well..
[19:30:48] <robertmaxrees> is your code before or after your jqui include?>
[19:34:36] <foo> robertmaxrees: found it, looks like this site uses foundation... which I'm just now learning about. And their tooltip feaure seems to work: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/components/tooltips.html - looks like with jquery + foundation tooltip there was a conflict
[19:34:56] <robertmaxrees> glad you found it.
[19:35:20] <foo> robertmaxrees: thank you :)
[20:33:55] <foo> Anyone here use foundation CSS/jQuery framework? I'm trying to change the tooltip nub and I've tried for 30 minutes. It's driving e crazy.
[20:33:58] <foo> me
[20:34:15] <foo> Trying to hide it now but this doesn't work: .tooltip > .nub {display: none!important;}
