[00:00:09] <lite_> yeah. just appears. hmm
[00:00:55] <andrew_r> it must have something to do with angular then. I tried a simple fiddle with a div and it worked when I added the .hide() call
[00:01:04] <lite_> ok
[00:19:40] <fabioportieri> good friday
[00:58:11] <grafi> every friday is a good friday
[01:05:17] <fabioportieri> grafi: agreed
[01:08:47] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/JwNgJ/ <-- how do i use for whole page?
[01:09:31] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/JwNgJ/1/
[01:09:44] <chakian> join #jquery-dev
[01:09:47] <Whiskey> thx
[01:09:50] <chakian> sorry
[01:10:04] <Whiskey> Cork, is it anyway to insert something when someone try to copy something?
[01:10:11] <grafi> oO
[01:10:19] <grafi> evil
[01:10:20] <Cork> Whiskey: yes
[01:10:27] <Cork> and there is several annoying sites to prove it
[01:10:46] <Whiskey> how?
[01:10:56] <Whiskey> i google it but don´t find mutch
[01:11:16] <Whiskey> thinked insted of keep whats allredy copyed just return empty
[01:12:02] <Cork> you modify the clipboardData object
[01:12:20] <grafi> ugh
[01:12:50] <Cork> luckely you can disable this feature :)
[01:13:04] <Cork> some sites even injects ads in the clipboard
[01:13:14] <Cork> or say "copying this content isn't allowed"
[01:13:34] <Whiskey> i thinked just use ""
[01:13:54] <Whiskey> insted of i have "test" in my copy, and try to copy someting and then get test again thats enoying
[01:13:55] <Cork> with a bit of luck its going the same way sa beforeunload
[01:13:56] <Whiskey> batter its empty
[01:15:02] <Whiskey> Cork but don´t find mutch on google about it :/
[01:15:24] <Whiskey> window.clipboardData.clearData ("Text"); :)
[01:17:00] <Whiskey> hmm did not work good :/
[01:18:52] <Whiskey> Cork, whats wrong http://jsfiddle.net/JwNgJ/2/
[01:19:49] <Serdar> can someone explain me, why line 2 of my JS script is showing the correct content, but if I check username on login.php side it is empty: http://jsfiddle.net/aAh9d/
[01:20:11] <Cork> Whiskey: window.clipboardData is ie
[01:20:22] <Cork> you need to use the webstandard for other browsers
[01:20:27] <Serdar> and I don't understand why, because if I tried that before without js it worked
[01:20:55] <Whiskey> ok what do i search after, does not JS have a defult one that applays to all ?
[01:21:29] <Cork> Serdar: cause you call it user and not username?
[01:22:04] <Serdar> wait what? let me check again
[01:23:05] <Serdar> no it is username, I put the content of user to username and can see in line 2 that it worked
[01:24:09] <Cork> Serdar: also your fields have no names
[01:24:13] <Cork> so they arn't submitted
[01:25:14] <seutje> there isn't even a form
[01:25:25] <Cork> there is
[01:25:40] <Cork> but it has no action or type
[01:25:46] <seutje> oh my bad, I'm blind
[01:26:00] <Serdar> I got to forms, one hidden and one shown. the shown will be filled with content and my js function will be called which puts the value of user in username and call submit
[01:26:04] <Serdar> this was the plan
[01:26:27] <Cork> Serdar: form don't care about id's
[01:26:44] <Cork> if you want to submit the values the fields NEED a name
[01:26:50] <Cork> else they could just as well not be there
[01:27:45] <Serdar> so I need to change id to name and everything is fine?
[01:27:52] <Cork> no
[01:27:57] <Cork> you want both
[01:27:58] <Serdar> puh
[01:28:08] <Cork> <input id="" type="" name="" value="">
[01:28:23] <Cork> the id is optional
[01:28:35] <Cork> but if you are to target it from js you want it to have an id
[01:29:22] <Cork> basically ids are global for all elements in a page, and have nothing to do with forms and form elements
[01:29:54] <Cork> name is specific for forms and form elements, and is the only thing they care about when it comes to form submission
[01:30:49] <Serdar> fsck, it was this simple
[01:32:45] <Serdar> oh boy
[01:32:56] <Serdar> hell I was looking for this issue about 3 days
[01:33:10] <Serdar> and it was a fscking name attribute
[01:36:30] <Serdar> thanks Cork
[01:36:35] <Cork> np
[01:37:23] <MrBaz> I have an issue with ie11 loading of a drop down list on focus. The focus event triggers but the items will not appear until a second click (because they have been added by that point) -   http://jsfiddle.net/dTArV/49/
[01:39:30] <fabioportieri> MrBaz: add before and turn on visibility on focus?
[01:40:22] <MrBaz> fabioportieri, There are about 200 on screen -  It's required as the html ends up too heavy to load.
[02:09:12] <dogmatic69> hi all, I have .on('click'..) for some buttons and adding more buttons with .append()
[02:09:50] <dogmatic69> the buttons added are not attached to the on('click'..) though. I thouhgt .on() re binds new elements on the fly?
[02:10:00] <dogmatic69> how do I get that event to work with the new buttons
[02:10:21] <Cork> dogmatic69: on doens't dynamically add to new elements
[02:10:27] <Cork> have a look at delegate
[02:10:32] <Cork> ?g jquery delegate
[02:10:33] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:10:42] <dogmatic69> damn
[02:10:45] <Cork> dogmatic69: read that page it will explain how to use on
[02:10:58] <dogmatic69> I thought on() was the "new" way...
[02:11:04] <Cork> it is
[02:11:19] <Cork> but it is several new ways to use through it
[02:11:54] <dogmatic69> ok, so something like .delegate('.button-class', 'click', function...)?
[02:12:07] <Cork> yes, but like i said, on can do it too
[02:12:13] <dogmatic69> that would replace $('.button-class').on('click', function..)
[02:12:15] <Cork> but read about it at that page
[02:12:18] <Cork> no
[02:17:24] <bigbugjava> Hi there, I really need to figure out a nut problem with Node.js getting a request to upload to amazon S3 server, more then a week with no success on that matter, anyone here has some experince with that?
[02:19:36] <Uhkis> you might wanna ask that in #node.js
[02:23:11] <dogmatic69> Cork:  This seems to work before $('.remove-section'').on('click', function() {..}) after: $('body').on('click', '.remove-section', function() {..})
[02:23:46] <Cork> dogmatic69: sure
[02:24:15] <Cork> dogmatic69: to take the long story, live (i suspect you come from here) was replaced with delegate
[02:24:29] <Cork> dogmatic69: delegate and bind was then combined into on
[02:24:51] <dogmatic69> never used delegate before, used live and then on
[02:24:55] <Cork> so on have both the delegate and the bind behavior, depending on the syntax you call it with
[02:25:00] <dogmatic69> cool
[02:25:10] <Cork> ya, but on is not similar to live at all
[02:25:13] <Cork> it is similar to bind
[02:25:21] <Cork> where one of the arguments has been moved
[02:25:24] <Cork> opps
[02:25:28] <Cork> sorry similar to delegate
[02:25:46] <Cork> the on page is quite bad at explaining this
[02:26:04] <Cork> the delegate does a much better job, and it points at how to use on for delegation
[02:26:11] <Cork> and that is why i said you should read that page
[02:26:20] <dogmatic69> thanks
[02:27:34] <Cork> dogmatic69: so the reason the original on call you showed didn't work was cause it was a bind call not a delegate
[02:36:29] <Jacta> Cork: !
[02:36:45] <Cork> ?
[02:55:43] <bigbugjava> Hi, why when I'm using $get.script function, it tried to get the code 4 times, so when I have a function inside that js code, it's excuted 4 times?!
[02:56:17] <Cork> bigbugjava: do you mean $.getScript ?
[02:56:20] <bigbugjava> http://jsfiddle.net/zEQ9K/ just the js part, when it is getting clicked, excuted 4 times
[02:56:22] <bigbugjava> yeah
[02:56:47] <Cork> bigbugjava: you prob have 4 articles in the page
[02:57:36] <bigbugjava> article it's where it gets loaded to
[02:57:44] <bigbugjava> need a better selector?
[02:57:50] <Cork> yse and you most likely have 4 of those
[02:57:53] <Cork> *yes
[02:58:08] <Cork> bigbugjava: well it depends on what you want to do
[02:58:39] <bigbugjava> the artice is in the index, I want to complete site to stay static and only that area changes all the time
[02:59:06] <Cork> if you just want to replace one of the article elements, you need a selector that targets just that one
[03:00:06] <bigbugjava> I have another class there content_switch
[03:00:12] <bigbugjava> so I did article.content_switch
[03:00:17] <bigbugjava> works like a charm
[03:00:25] <bigbugjava> thx Cork!
[03:03:51] <bigbugjava> Cork another Q if you got the time, I'm using objects to retrive data from facebook, than appening it to table, in the table I get profile pictuers, and on hover, the title is there full names, I want to add a search feature, is it possible to search for "title" attr?
[03:04:24] <bigbugjava> the name is set like this :  td.setAttribute('title',data.data[i].name );
[03:21:38] <Cork> bigbugjava: '[title]' or '[title="content"]
[03:28:02] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:29:20] <jomofcw> Is there a way to get the "final URL" load by an AJAX query ? i.e. I load "a.php" in AJAX, but this one will redirect to "b.php", so it's finally the content of "b.php" that I get but how to get the "final URL" which is "b.php". Please ?
[03:32:51] <fabioportieri> ?
[03:34:42] <Cork> jomofcw: no
[03:34:54] <Cork> jomofcw: that is actually per spec
[03:35:10] <Cork> jomofcw: simplest is to have the server set a header for the end url
[03:35:21] <Cork> and then just grab that header on the js side
[04:24:31] <paulvd> if i want to deduct 20px from this jQuery(".slider_content").width(jQuery(window).width());, how would i do it ? jQuery(".slider_content").width(jQuery(window).width()-20); ?
[04:25:06] <Cork> yes
[04:25:24] <paulvd> thanks
[05:01:56] <abishek> what is the map file used for when using the jquery library?
[05:02:28] <abishek> can i not use the jquery library without the map file?
[05:11:57] <grafi> whats the map file?
[05:18:45] <_rgn> source maps
[05:18:50] <_rgn> yes you can
[05:26:25] <grafi> ahh
[05:26:25] <grafi> source maps
[06:30:09] <jomofcw> Cork hello ! Thanks for your answer ! It seems to be a correct way to do it. Shall I use request.getAllResponseHeaders() ? Or is there a jQuery thing to do it ?
[07:10:49] <Siecje> I added a new field and now I am getting duplicate information https://dpaste.de/oi7C how can I filter out the duplicate numbers form the comment[]
[07:12:14] <rethus> i search a nice image-zoomer for my webpage. any suggestions for it here?
[07:14:25] <Siecje> result_active.valueOf('module[]'); contains the comment[] elements as well
[07:27:03] <felixjet> how i can call both onchange and onkeyup at the same time?
[07:29:30] <fabioportieri> trigger()
[07:29:50] <felixjet> nvm, i used .bind()
[07:30:02] <joroci> use .on(
[07:30:14] <zechola> .on() will take multiple events
[07:30:29] <felixjet> ah k, thx
[07:30:32] <joroci> depends
[07:30:48] <felixjet> no need to bind it anyway
[07:30:52] <felixjet> so .on() better
[07:31:03] <joroci> maybe use one?
[07:31:26] <joroci> it won't be multiple
[07:31:51] <grafi> we are all aware that .bind is just calling .on behind the scenes right? ^^
[07:32:23] <felixjet> what do you mean by multiple?
[07:32:38] <joroci> As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document.
[07:33:01] <felixjet> so as i said.. im going to use .on() xD
[07:33:14] <Siecje> how would I remove sortable from all elements with a given name
[07:33:21] <joroci> maybe bind use on but why go the long way?
[07:34:39] <Siecje> https://dpaste.de/WdGJ
[07:35:52] <grafi> you mean the short way
[07:37:04] <felixjet> and... how can i calculate this ?
[07:37:04] <felixjet> http://jsfiddle.net/HV86v/
[07:37:29] <felixjet> its not calculated as a calculator would do
[07:37:34] <felixjet> damn floats i.i
[07:38:05] <felixjet> https://www.google.es/search?q=43.12+*+4.1
[07:39:04] <grafi> do you need it to be exact?
[07:39:10] <grafi> or why are we doing math here
[07:39:10] <grafi> ...
[07:41:10] <felixjet> yes, i ned
[07:41:13] <felixjet> need*
[07:43:12] <joroci> what about the floats?
[07:43:42] <felixjet> nvm
[07:44:20] <felixjet> found the solution already http://jsfiddle.net/HV86v/1/
[07:45:45] <grafi> and what a great solution it is...
[07:48:04] <joroci> not perfect :)
[07:49:31] <felixjet> yea
[07:49:54] <Siecje> I'm trying to exclude elements with the name "notsortable" https://dpaste.de/SkIF
[07:50:35] <joroci> you get an error?
[07:51:15] <joroci> or it's just not working
[07:51:16] <joroci> ?
[07:53:04] <jphase> Siecje: that should honestly work fine, but you can also do that in your selector as well $('#sortable tbody tr:not([name=notsortable])')
[07:54:32] <jphase> oh, actually that wouldn't work fine... you forgot the tr
[07:54:32] <jphase> you could add a tr after the tbody in yours or use mine
[07:54:42] <joroci> shouldn't notsortable be in quotes?
[07:54:48] <Siecje> jphase: for some reason with that selector the columns are sortable not the rows?
[07:55:05] <Siecje> like I used to be able to drag a tr element and move it now it drags a td element
[07:56:06] <jphase> ohh you're calling UI sortable ic
[07:56:23] <jphase> so you need to bind that to the tbody itself, I see the problem
[07:56:54] * jphase reads UI sortable API docs
[07:58:14] <jphase> Siecje: can you make a jsfiddle of what you're trying to accomplish? Sortable shouldn't need to bind to tbody or anything.
[07:58:17] <Siecje> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/x5rVK/
[07:58:48] <Siecje> I would like to be able to drag the entire tr with info 1 info 2 ...
[07:58:49] <jphase> and you absolutely need to use tables?
[07:59:24] <Siecje> well right now it works but I have extra rows that are draggable
[08:00:58] <jphase> Siecje: you absolutely need to use tables with what you're doing?
[08:02:40] <Siecje> I guess not why
[08:02:42] <Siecje> http://jsfiddle.net/x5rVK/2/
[08:03:07] <jphase> <ul> elements are typically used for UI sortable
[08:04:16] <Siecje> thanks, I'll fight with this some more and then see about switching
[08:04:31] <felixjet> http://jsfiddle.net/HV86v/2/
[08:04:36] <felixjet> this one is perfect i guess :P
[08:04:37] <jphase> well, you can do it, one sec
[08:05:00] <felixjet> joroci ^
[08:05:14] <joroci> i'm not even sure why you need to calculate it this way?:)
[08:06:32] <felixjet> because i need it to be exact
[08:06:48] <dwarder> how do i stop executing in google chrome?
[08:06:51] <dwarder> debug; ?
[08:06:55] <dwarder> debugger; ?
[08:07:31] <andrew_r> dwarder: debugger; or you can set a breakpoint with the developer tools
[08:07:57] <dwarder> thank you
[08:08:04] <jphase> Siecje: the problem is that .sortable will make the children of the element you call it on sortable, hence all the columns then becoming sortable. What you're specifically trying to do is shown here:  http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#items
[08:09:24] <jphase> Siecje: I would also highly recommend using unordered lists instead of tables since you can have each list live independently of one another rather then them all being in the same <tbody> tag which is sort of limiting you in this case.
[08:09:47] <joroci> felixjet http://jsfiddle.net/HV86v/3/ :)
[08:10:48] <felixjet> the same, just 2 functions
[08:11:19] <felixjet> mine is probably faster?
[08:11:29] <felixjet> same casting, but avoiding a function call
[08:12:06] <joroci> less code
[08:12:14] <joroci> duplicate
[08:12:43] <felixjet> http://jsfiddle.net/HV86v/4/
[08:12:44] <felixjet> even less
[08:12:45] <felixjet> xD
[08:13:21] <felixjet> removed a var = "" and an else
[08:14:49] <joroci> felixjet
[08:14:51] <joroci> http://jsfiddle.net/HV86v/5/ :)
[08:14:55] <Siecje> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/x5rVK/4/ I still can't get it to wor
[08:15:10] <felixjet> hahaha, joroci thats chating
[08:15:13] <felixjet> cheating*
[08:15:15] <felixjet> its not exact
[08:15:18] <felixjet> depends on the numbers
[08:15:21] <joroci> :P
[08:15:26] <felixjet> now it looks correct, but just that xD
[08:16:07] <joroci> it's cheating?
[08:16:16] <jphase> Siecje: you forgot , after your sortable properties
[08:16:50] <jphase> Siecje: also, <tr name="notsortable"> should change to <tr class="notsortable">
[08:17:15] <jphase> Siecje: http://jsfiddle.net/x5rVK/7/
[08:18:00] <joroci> looks good to me :)
[08:19:07] <Siecje> jphase: thanks
[08:19:25] <jphase> np
[08:20:33] <andrew_r> I'm trying to figure out a way to create a copy of jQuery on my page, so I can use it to run a plugin, then when the content is removed, delete the copy of jQuery so it releases the memory used
[08:20:43] <andrew_r> it's a single page application, and the plugin is jqGrid
[08:21:03] <NoiseEee> andrew_r: pretty sure thats not what happens
[08:21:26] <NoiseEee> andrew_r: if you're that concerned about space and memory, try one less jpg
[08:21:35] <andrew_r> I've tried: var grid = $; grid('#myGrid').jqGrid({ // options });  -- then later when the grid is removed, grid = null;
[08:21:40] <andrew_r> doesn't work
[08:22:27] <felixjet> joroci, http://jsfiddle.net/HV86v/7/
[08:22:44] <felixjet> not the same ^^
[08:23:13] <joroci> i thought you wanted only 3 digits after the ddot
[08:23:14] <joroci> dot
[08:23:39] <felixjet> anyway using toFixed is not exact
[08:23:40] <andrew_r> NoiseEee: well... some of the grids have a lot of data in them, the problem is after removing the grid from the page using .remove(), the memory isn't released because of closure scope
[08:24:27] <andrew_r> it depends on the browser, IE8 is the worst. depending on how much data, switch to the "next" grid can result in 12mb lost
[08:25:48] <snover> andrew_r: try a better grid like dgrid
[08:26:39] <duderion> how can the helper(clone) position be fixed while dragging. it's not on the mouse's position
[08:27:16] <ScottG> I recently learned that there's more than one kind of 'selected' value for an option. You can set it to be selected and you can give the element the selected attribute. The latter being more permanent and being used when a reset button is pressed. How can I use js to set the selected attribute so it actually is applied to the element and persists so it can be used with the reset button?
[08:28:24] <jphase> ScottG: $('option#myoption').attr('selected', 'selected');
[08:30:14] <ScottG> jphase: That was my guess too but if (assuming you're using chrome) you look at the elements, the selected attribute isn't applied even though it does actually select the option
[08:30:33] <ScottG> What this means is that when I press the reset button the option will become turned off
[08:31:00] <jphase> well that's odd. let me fiddle this
[08:32:42] <jphase> ScottG: no it applies to the option: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/u2Qc7/
[08:32:56] <jphase> if you inspect you'll see selected="selected" in the option
[08:33:30] <jphase> if it's not applying to your option perhaps some other sorcery is getting in the way :\
[08:37:10] <ScottG> Ok interesting. As a side note, isn't the proper way to have the html for that an empty 'selected' attribute?
[08:37:23] <ScottG> as in no ='selected'
[08:37:42] <ScottG> just <input blahblah selected>
[08:38:25] <duderion> ;/ my clone helper if off position
[08:38:31] <duderion> is off position
[08:38:37] <jphase> ScottG: yes, but IE <=7 whines when you do that
[08:38:46] <drager> Any good practice for having a namespace "over multiple files" and different objects in that namespace+
[08:38:50] <ScottG> ah interesting
[08:38:58] <jphase> perhaps <= 6, I can't remember
[08:39:11] <ScottG> damn that's old
[08:39:56] <jphase> yeah, you'd be surprised how many companies like Wells Fargo and such still lock their employees at XP SPold without the ability for updates though :\
[08:40:33] <jphase> jQuery tries to be compatible with anything that supports js so more power to them heh
[08:41:05] <pacmanfan> i'm pretty curious what will happen this april
[08:41:22] <ScottG> jphase: still looking into why that isn't working on my page
[08:41:30] <pacmanfan> there will no doubt be some owned winxp boxes
[08:43:24] <jphase> yeah, and for those of you that haven't heard, check your bank statements if you've shopped at Target in the last 2-3 months
[08:51:19] <ScottG> jphase: ugh i can't figure this out
[08:51:41] <jphase> ScottG: is your site public?
[08:52:23] <ScottG> I mean I can run the exact same kind of thing you had there in the chrome console and then check out the elements tab and it hasn't changed
[08:53:10] <jphase> hmm, odd
[08:53:32] <pacmanfan> i cannot get some code to initialize on my page
[08:53:46] <ScottG> jphase: like, it becomes selected but it doesn't seem to update in the dom
[08:53:51] <NaOH> Why is my .hover() so buggy? http://jsfiddle.net/Wxhtv/
[08:53:52] <pacmanfan> i'm trying to get the jquerytools tooltip working, but i think i'm initializing it wrong
[08:54:11] <ScottG> jphase: maybe I can manually set the html or something lol
[08:56:48] <ScottG> jphase: well that updates it in the dom but it still doesn't seem to matter to the reset button
[08:57:51] <jphase> ScottG: what do you mean by "reset" button exactly?
[08:58:06] <ScottG> input with type="reset"
[08:58:24] <ScottG> i also just learned about it recently
[08:58:37] <ScottG> So I'm probably a little fuzzy on how it specifically works
[09:00:55] <pachet> ?wat
[09:01:04] <pachet> !wat
[09:01:08] <pachet> bleh
[09:01:53] <jphase> ScottG: yeah, idk much about that type at all, but it's not working in my fiddle either. I'd just bind an additional click event to that button in jQuery that clears the selected attribute from the options
[09:03:56] <ScottG> What I really need to know is what value exactly the reset button looks for and how to set that value
[09:05:46] <zorph> $('.collection').animate()...how can I animate a collection like dominos? delay in between each element animation
[09:06:10] <zorph> I'm researching the queue() but can't seem to figure out the domino effect for animating a collection of items
[09:13:40] <jphase> zorph: you can use the complete function in animate
[09:14:28] <zorph> how more specifically?
[09:15:01] <NoiseEee> ScottG: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement.reset
[09:15:03] <NoiseEee> Scott
[09:15:32] <ScottG> NoiseEee: thanks, I'll check this out
[09:15:33] <NoiseEee> ScottG: whatever form values that existed when the form was presented.
[09:17:22] <ScottG> NoiseEee: oh so modifying anything with js at all won't work
[09:17:39] <ScottG> NoiseEee: but that information must be stored somewhere to get at
[09:17:41] <NoiseEee> nope, but certainly you can create your own 'reset' type of function
[09:17:58] <NoiseEee> ScottG: yeah, presumably the "value" attribute of the form elements
[09:18:35] <zorph> I need to trigger the same animation on the next element in the collection...upon animate complete callback
[09:22:13] <joroci> hmm
[09:22:57] <ahandy> zorph, function animateit(element) { element.animate({}, function() { animateit(element); });
[09:23:11] <ahandy> zorph, use multiple elements each with an id that that is, for example: element1, element2, element3
[09:23:24] <ahandy> zorph, and then set i = 1, increase it on each callback, and thus animate the next element
[09:23:24] <ahandy> etc
[09:24:15] <ericwood> yo I have a selector question!
[09:24:55] <ericwood> I have two possible situations: '<div><p>text!!!!<br></p></div>' and '<div><p><br></p></div>'
[09:25:12] <ericwood> I'd like to select all situatiosn like the last one but only if there's no text inside the <p> tag
[09:25:25] <ericwood> previously I've tried .find('p:has(> br:only-child)') but that doesn't seem to do the trick
[09:25:58] <Carty> Hey, I want to make a div change colour (done)  but I want the colour to fade in (at the moment it just instantly changes)
[09:26:23] <Gorchev> Hello All !
[09:26:27] <crash1hd> can anyone help me with this little issue http://jsfiddle.net/HKX7c/1/
[09:26:31] <Gorchev> Nice to join this channel :)
[09:26:50] <Carty> http://pastebin.com/D8MG5MWR
[09:30:14] <Carty> this is awfully quiet
[09:34:31] <jrajav> jQuery is one of the most heavily documented libraries on the planet
[09:34:37] <jrajav> A lot of people find their answer before getting here
[09:34:46] <jrajav> (I'm just bullshitting, I don't actually know)
[09:34:57] <Mattias> ^^
[09:37:23] <shoky> Carty you need jquery-ui or the jquery-color plugin
[09:37:24] <scar> i am using an html to pdf generator, and each page container is set for 8.5 / 11in, and works fine. however, i have designs and elements setup at the top and bottom of the page container, so there is a finite space that i can place content in there.
[09:37:27] <shoky> to animate color
[09:37:37] <scar> however, how can i have it "overflow" into multipe page containers using js?
[09:38:12] <scar> i have content i want to insert, and if it reaches the end of the inner container within the page container, i want it to auto-create a new page container and keep dumping the data
[09:38:17] <scar> just not sure how to measure this out
[09:39:51] <duch_kazatel> scar are you looking to break on sections?  on words?  letters?  where you want to break changes the strategy a little.
[09:40:09] <scar> i want it to break where natural
[09:41:01] <duch_kazatel> scar that... doesn't make any sense.  if it's by div, for instance, you could insert, see if it's too tall, then remove it, create your new page, and inject it there instead.
[09:41:03] <scar> i thought about sections, but some may be paragraphs, or UL, or anything
[09:41:17] <scar> yes i was thinking of that, however what if the div itself is bigger than an inner page content area
[09:41:24] <scar> thats the prob i was running into when brainstorming
[09:41:59] <duch_kazatel> then your code would say something like "if too tall for one page, find the next 'natural' breakpoint".
[09:42:51] <scar> that's what im not sure how to do-- how to find the natural breakpoint. i have all the content basically like a big blog post-- no images. just paragraphs of txt, possibly UL or OL of many items prob exceeding height of 1 page
[09:43:00] <scar> just loop through each item?
[09:43:09] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to figure that part out yourself.
[09:43:19] <duch_kazatel> that's more of a design question and not a coding question :)
[09:43:37] <scar> no, bc i need to have the js parse this content to make sure it all fits and breaks naturally
[09:43:52] <scar> do i just grab the code, and loop through every dom element? just not sure how that would work
[09:44:01] <NoiseEee> don't print CSS stylesheets take care of that for you?
[09:44:24] <duch_kazatel> that's a good point.  and your code is going to be relatively complex anyway.
[09:44:26] <scar> no idea ;) but if so, i'll definately look into it
[09:44:36] <scar> yeah, im using the princexml pdf gen
[09:45:06] <scar> basically want a whole report coul be 2-20 pages, but want it to fit in my nicely built html/css template, using my marked inner areas for content
[09:45:15] <scar> i figured JS would be the way i need to, didnt know CSS would create more divs for me, etc
[09:45:19] <duch_kazatel> i've done something similar with phantom.js
[09:45:26] <duch_kazatel> css can't do that for you.
[09:45:33] <scar> i just dont want the PDF to look like it was published in word
[09:45:38] <duch_kazatel> well, not in a super convenient way, at least.
[09:45:52] <duch_kazatel> css CAN get the layout more print-friendly.
[09:46:21] <scar> yeah i have the layout all nice, but lets say i have one div thats 600x500 where content can go.. if it get stoo big, create new page, new page, etc until all content is exhausted
[09:46:45] <scar> maybe ill have to create a class and just carefully craft the html output of the content coming in to the js
[09:46:46] <duch_kazatel> i assume you know the basics of how to do that with your code, right?
[09:46:53] <ravigehlot> Any reason why only one callback function is triggering and not the other? http://jsfiddle.net/JBNuK/
[09:47:29] <scar> yes, with js, but im unsure how to _ensure_ perfect content insertion-- i dont want a lot of blank space at the bottom of a page in the middle of the doc for one, and also i dont want something to break bc its too big anyway and wont even show bc it cant fit, etc
[09:47:55] <duch_kazatel> scar and that's what I'm saying - you'll have to work through each scenario yourself and determine those rules
[09:48:20] <duch_kazatel> ravigehlot what are you expecting?  for both to fire on mouseover?
[09:49:24] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: I am expecting it to show one image on hover and then another at mouseout
[09:49:45] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: it works for mouseenter...on hover...not mouseout
[09:49:51] <duch_kazatel> ravi those two functions look identical.
[09:50:11] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: i know, i changed the bottom one to _inactive.jpg and _active...same issue though
[09:50:24] <duch_kazatel> not in the example you linked.
[09:50:25] <scar> duch_kazatel, yeah i think im just going to have to handle it with the html-- ill just carefully add classes to every element as i can-- just sucks im prob gonna have to write for every html tag type i use
[09:50:29] <duch_kazatel> they are 100% the exact some piece of code.
[09:50:37] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: changing it on the example
[09:50:49] <duch_kazatel> scar why not just leverage the tag names themselves in that case?
[09:50:51] <scar> duch_kazatel, well thanks for at least confirming my initial thought process/method was the proper route heh
[09:51:03] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/JBNuK/1/
[09:51:05] <scar> well, lets say i have big paragraphs of text-- what then?
[09:51:47] <duch_kazatel> scar then your code could say something like "if it's a <p> and the single <p> doesn't fit onto one page, break it on a word."
[09:51:53] <duch_kazatel> lots of logic, but it'll work.
[09:52:13] <scar> ok but how to "break it on a word" -- is that some basic js/jquery method, or is that in itself something i need to creat?
[09:52:34] <scar> is there a function that tells me where to break, or do i need to loop thru each word, for example
[09:52:54] <duch_kazatel> scar you'll have to parse the text yourself in that case - there's not magic method there.
[09:53:10] <scar> ok so its gonna be a crawler, essentially lol
[09:53:24] <duch_kazatel> scar - more like a parser, but yeah.
[09:53:44] <duch_kazatel> but css should cover those cases fine.  have you thought about applying styling to this job, instead?
[09:53:59] <duch_kazatel> or do you need finer-grained control of where exactly the breaks occur?
[09:54:20] <Carty> shoky: sorry for the lengthy reply, so installing JQuery UI or colour allows me to fix it how?  (and I link it the same way, in the head section)?
[09:54:34] <scar> i dont care where the breaks occur, but i have to have them fit inside an inner div thats inside a parent page container-- so im not sure how css can help. everything is all styled out just fine, just trying to figure out how to get js to perfectly split it up
[09:55:10] <duch_kazatel> scar have you even tried a test run, then?  if you don't particularly care where the breaks occur, you could do that all with CSS>
[09:55:22] <duch_kazatel> ravigehlot not sure why the mouseout isn't happening.  have you tried stepping through in chrome's web dev tools or firebug?
[09:55:26] <scar> how can i do it with css - how can css generate html  code?
[09:55:44] <duch_kazatel> css doesn't - css controls the rules about how things display though.
[09:55:50] <duch_kazatel> have you tried a test pring?
[09:55:51] <duch_kazatel> *print
[09:56:28] <duch_kazatel> it should naturally break things just fine.
[09:56:28] <scar> yes, but not using js to modify anything
[09:56:39] <scar> yeah but when it breaks, where does the rest of the content go??
[09:56:44] <duch_kazatel> to the next page.
[09:56:47] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[09:56:47] <scar> thre's no extra page container for it to go
[09:56:55] <scar> how does it know to generate a whole page
[09:57:09] <scar> i have page divs, that are stacked vertically, 8.5in x 11in
[09:57:22] <scar> within each page div is say 600x500 div that content cant fit
[09:57:28] <scar> how can css create new page containers
[09:57:42] <scar> im trying to understand lol
[09:57:43] <duch_kazatel> CSS does not.  this application sounds very inefficient if that's how you have to use it.
[09:58:05] <andrew_r> is there a way I can get a list of all variables that are in closure scope, in code?
[09:58:23] <duch_kazatel> the print driver/printer work in tandem to spit out a page and know when to start a new page.
[09:58:25] <scar> duch_kazatel, im creating PDFs with fixed content areas...
[09:58:43] <scar> its not a printer, its princexml thats turning my page divs into pages in a pdf document
[09:59:12] <duch_kazatel> ah, so this is never printer bound - not sure where I got that.
[09:59:24] <duch_kazatel> you'll need to determine those rules yourself.
[09:59:28] <scar> if i do not use page divs, princexml will generate auto-pages for me, splitting it up
[09:59:29] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/JBNuK/2/ Could it be that those functions are collinding somehow?
[09:59:33] <duch_kazatel> there's no magic javascript to do this
[09:59:45] <scar> so i need to loop thru everthing ;)
[10:00:05] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: or maybe it doesn't remember that I moused over on mouse out?
[10:00:05] <duch_kazatel> scar I don't know how your application works, so I can't be of much help.
[10:00:27] <duch_kazatel> I know that, with phantom.js when printing PDFs, it just started a second page when content overflowed the first.
[10:00:37] <scar> its not about the application. its about the javascript taking incoming output (html) and splitting it up somehow into spaces that can fit 600x500 blocks
[10:00:42] <scar> as nicely as possible
[10:00:43] <scar> heh
[10:01:03] <duch_kazatel> scar sure, but when I did a project very similar to that, I didn't need to do anything like that.
[10:01:10] <duch_kazatel> the application generating the pdf did it for me.
[10:01:45] <duch_kazatel> and ravigehlot it'll "remember" just fine - do you have a more complete functioning example?
[10:02:22] <scar> duch_kazatel, yeah but did u have 1 specific area within the pdf that only would fit the available content? i have other html elements on the pdc doc page so its not like i can have the content just dropped anywhere
[10:02:31] <NoiseEee> scar: if you're serious about producing print-quality PDFs with accurate layouts, then you'll need a professional solution like www.princexml.com which is fully css3 compat, and has additional print/PDF-specific CSS syntax for use as well.
[10:02:37] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: what do you need the HTML?
[10:03:01] <NoiseEee> scar: it ain't about javascript, its about CSS for media="print".
[10:03:26] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/JBNuK/3/
[10:03:37] <NoiseEee> scar: you should also peek at http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/24/how-to-set-up-a-print-style-sheet/ and leave the JS out of it.
[10:03:53] <duch_kazatel> ravigehlot can you make that actually function, with the jquery setup and everything/
[10:04:06] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: if I only knew how
[10:04:56] <scar> NoiseEee, how does print css create page divs for me tho?
[10:05:07] <scar> NoiseEee, and im using pr incexml
[10:05:20] <NoiseEee> scar: then none of this should be an issue, learn HOW to use princeXML better
[10:05:23] <scar> im following their examples
[10:05:53] <duch_kazatel> ravigehlot http://i.imgur.com/qOLE6uo.png
[10:06:02] <duch_kazatel> learn how to use those tools :)
[10:07:01] <NoiseEee> scar: its either about adding containers with rules on the containers, like min/max width... etc
[10:07:27] <NoiseEee> scar: you should be concerning yourself with markup and layout, not with Javascript and sizing for print via JS
[10:07:29] <duch_kazatel> Something tells me this princexml setup is very restrictive.  looks expensive, too.
[10:07:42] <NoiseEee> scar: peek at the forums, they have good answers and questions get answered queickly
[10:08:22] <petethepig> Hello everyone
[10:08:22] <scar> its not really for print though. from what you're saying i just need to dump all my content in an html doc and somehow have CSS generate all of the header and footer elements and divs, etc that belong on each page
[10:08:41] <scar> i will look into forums. hopefully ill have luck
[10:08:57] <scar> otehrwise i really dont see how js isnt the answer to split the content into sections thats i have allocated
[10:09:11] <NoiseEee> scar: if its a PDF, its for print.
[10:09:18] <duch_kazatel> scar PDFs are basically the same concept.
[10:09:41] <scar> i have a cover page, then content that will be dropped into as many "page layout 2 html code i have" divs i need to until the content is fully displayed, then ih ave another page layout for the end/backpage
[10:09:45] <duch_kazatel> scar you do not need to create extra markup - you should try a test run with a big old paragraph that covers 2 pages.
[10:10:12] <NoiseEee> scar: all of that is completely possible with princeXML sans javascript
[10:10:21] <scar> duch_kazatel, i can get princexml to generate multiple page pdfs... i can get princexml to generate the pages EXACTLY how i want them to look... just dunno how to get dynamic content that could fill 2-20 pages to fll up in pages
[10:10:34] <petethepig> Can anyone explain, why is it impossible to use toggle function this way: $("anything").toggle(function(){return 'some custom condition';});
[10:10:51] <duch_kazatel> scar try what I suggested and see waht the result is.
[10:10:54] <NoiseEee> scar: you should create an HTML doc with all those 2-20 pages, and send that off to prince.
[10:11:15] <scar> NoiseEee, exactly but thats the thing.... i dont know how to determine when to split the content into pages...
[10:11:23] <scar> if i use js to measure each element, what if an element is bigger than 1 page, for example
[10:11:26] <duch_kazatel> scar you shouldn't need to is what we're saying.
[10:11:27] <NoiseEee> scar: no no no no
[10:11:51] <scar> if i have content that comes in and it can fit 7 pages, i want it to fill up each mini div within my page container 7 times until its all used up
[10:11:56] <scar> then move on...
[10:12:27] <scar> but i have html elements all around it... theres a specific "inner" div within each "page block" thats 600x500pixels... each page cotnainer is 8.5x11in
[10:12:28] <duch_kazatel> scar have you tried making a big ol' paragraph that'd cover 2 pages and tried converting that?
[10:12:41] <NoiseEee> scar: hit their forums, either way this is OT for #jquery
[10:12:44] <scar> duch_kazatel, yes, and it does exactly what i thought it would: make it look like a word document
[10:13:00] <scar> well, if im using jquery tos plit my content i dont see how its OT
[10:13:15] <scar> i have fixed width / height divs i want content to split into equally-- heh
[10:13:24] <NoiseEee> scar: honestly, take a break. DO NOT SPLIT/CREATE/ALTER content with JS in order to 'fit' it in somewhere
[10:13:27] <scar> i think yall thijnk i dont know how to get a multip age pdf, and i do
[10:13:35] <NoiseEee> dude I work with prince daily
[10:13:41] <duch_kazatel> I do - I used phantomJS and had NO issues whatsoever ;)
[10:13:56] <scar> but i think my issue is being misunderstood
[10:13:56] <NoiseEee> in the same way you'd never use JS to figure out how "large" to make a div on screen, you'd never do it for print either
[10:14:11] <NoiseEee> this is why CSS was invented
[10:14:11] <scar> how can i use php to determine when i have filled up 500 pixels of height, so i can then create a new page div?
[10:14:42] <duch_kazatel> scar THAT'S off topic :)
[10:14:46] <scar> how can HTML/CSS go oh hey this entire content trying to fit inside this 600x500 div-- usually it either overflows or not
[10:15:02] <scar> but when it overflows, i want it to create a new div, and drop what content overflowed
[10:15:15] <joroci> why use php and not js?
[10:15:34] <duch_kazatel> joroci why use js and not css?
[10:15:39] <scar> im using php to generate the html frames, and then im gonna have JS duplicate the frames as needed to allow all the conent to fe filled
[10:15:44] <duch_kazatel> petethepig are you what are you returning?
[10:15:45] <scar> i dont see how css creates new html
[10:15:58] <Kambfhase> duch_kazatel: css is not turing complete ;)
[10:16:00] <scar> jas maye a visual will help, my final attempt:
[10:16:03] <duch_kazatel> css does not,  this is off topic.  go to the princexml forums, because appartently we can't help you.
[10:16:40] <joroci> duch he want to create a new div how is that possible?
[10:16:56] <duch_kazatel> joroci it's possible but likely completely unnecessary.
[10:17:16] <joroci> create a div element with css?
[10:17:22] <duch_kazatel> for their use case.
[10:17:28] <petethepig> duch_kazatel I don't quite get what you're asking me
[10:18:00] <scar> ok let me strt over
[10:18:11] <scar> if i have this html code, with the inner div being 4x3 in :
[10:18:11] <scar> http://jsfiddle.net/8EJyU/
[10:18:12] <duch_kazatel> petethepig which version of .toggle() are you intending to call?  there are two different ones.
[10:18:22] <darkfrog> why is $(window.contentFrame) (accessing by name) work differently that $('#contentFrame') (accessing by id)?
[10:18:33] <darkfrog> they *should* reference the exact same iframe
[10:19:02] <petethepig> duch_kazatel the .toggle( showOrHide ) one
[10:19:04] <scar> if i have content that happens to be say 16 inches tall THIS MOMENT, but could be any size any time, how do i use JS to split the incoming content into muktiple page/inner divs, ONLY allowing content to fit inside the inner div-- when it hits the 4x3in limitation, have JS duplicate the page html code
[10:20:08] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: $ starts at the document level
[10:20:20] <petethepig> duch_kazatel it seems to me that it would be cool to have something like .toggle(function(){return showOrHide})
[10:20:32] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: var l = window.contentFrame;  l = $(l); console.log(l)
[10:20:32] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: I don't understand?
[10:20:38] <Kambfhase> darkfrog: you should not do window.elementname
[10:20:39] <duch_kazatel> petethepig you can do that - return 0 or 1.
[10:20:51] <NoiseEee> $('window.something') = in the document, search for a window element
[10:21:01] <darkfrog> Kambfhase: it would seem that's the only way to reliably get the scroll offset for the iframe
[10:21:09] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: ain't gonna happen / the window isn't part of the document.
[10:21:37] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: right, but it's an iframe in the document, so it should be able to be found in the document as well, right?
[10:22:09] <petethepig> duch_kazatel I can do .toggle(function(){return showOrHide}()), but not .toggle(function(){return showOrHideBasedOnTheCurrentElement})
[10:22:11] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: no
[10:22:22] <darkfrog> $('#contentFrame').offsetTop() == 0 when $(window.contentFrame).offsetTop() is correct <-- I don't understand why these would return different values?
[10:22:38] <duch_kazatel> petethepig huh?  can you provide a functioning example in jsfiddle?
[10:22:52] <jhoffmcd> Do i need to use push() in a jquery each loop? Im having trouble building an associative array with multiple values
[10:22:52] <petethepig> duch_kazatel sure
[10:22:55] <darkfrog> ...when <iframe id="contentFrame" name="contentFrame" ...
[10:23:14] <scar> NoiseEee, ahhh are you referring to the conent: flow(foo) ? basically turning my div into a header?
[10:23:35] <duch_kazatel> jhoffmcd javascrit doesn't have associative arrays - are you creating an object with "named indexes"?>
[10:23:49] <darkfrog> window.contentFrame <-- this is something other than the HTMLIFrameElement it would seem
[10:23:56] <jhoffmcd> duch_kazatel yes!
[10:24:00] <jhoffmcd> Sorry im coming from php land
[10:24:41] <duch_kazatel> jhoffmcd that's fine :) common mistake.  youcan basically do var myObj = {}; myObj.aProp1 = 'a thing!'; myObj.aProp2 = 'something else!';
[10:25:01] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: you should not be using that method
[10:25:04] <darkfrog> perhaps more proper: myObject[key] = value
[10:25:23] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: how would you get the offsetTop from an iframe?
[10:25:26] <duch_kazatel> darkfrog that's not "more proper" - anything in between the square brackets is evaluated to dot notation.
[10:25:29] <jhoffmcd> duch_kazatel, my current problem is not overwriting my previous entry in my each loop
[10:26:02] <duch_kazatel> jhoffmcd do you have a fiddle?
[10:26:23] <jhoffmcd> yeah
[10:26:26] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: of the <iframe> element?
[10:26:32] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: yes
[10:27:54] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: http://jsfiddle.net/t9aEc/
[10:28:58] <jhoffmcd> http://jsfiddle.net/JesseMCD/JQsJk/
[10:29:12] <jhoffmcd> still new with jquery, im wondering if i need to use push or not
[10:29:36] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: why indexed offsetTop instead of scrollTop()?
[10:29:57] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: what?  you asked me for the offsetTop of the iframe
[10:30:22] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: the jQuery offsetTop == scrollTop(), right?
[10:30:23] <duch_kazatel> jhoffmcd aaaah this makes more sense - you're VERY confused about javascript :)
[10:30:33] <jhoffmcd> haha thought so
[10:31:04] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: no
[10:31:08] <duch_kazatel> jhoffmcd first of all, var $tiles = []; is confusing.  generally you prepend jquery objects with $ - tiles is not a jquery object.
[10:31:11] <duch_kazatel> it's a plain array.
[10:31:41] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: what's the difference?
[10:32:08] <jhoffmcd> I guess thats another thing, i see examples where people use the $ and others where they don't
[10:32:14] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: "Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements or set the vertical position of the scroll bar for every matched element." via http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[10:32:24] <duch_kazatel> jhoffmcd convention.  prepending $ generally means it's a jquery object/.
[10:32:36] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: scrollbars have nothing to do with offsetTop
[10:32:40] <duch_kazatel> depending on you who ask, at least.
[10:32:58] <jhoffmcd> okay i se
[10:33:25] <jhoffmcd> so my tiles, i and obj for convention and readability should not have the $
[10:34:00] <jhoffmcd> but the $('.title-item') IS and object correct?
[10:34:29] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: sorry, I actually did mean scroll position in the first place I just mis-spoke
[10:35:44] <duch_kazatel> jhoffmcd almost everything in JS is an object :)
[10:36:32] <jhoffmcd> duch_kazatel, i thinking im getting the hang of it
[10:37:17] <petethepig> duch_kazatel Here is an example of what I'm trying to achieve http://jsfiddle.net/PcEJ4/4/
[10:37:45] <duch_kazatel> I just got pulled into something with work - I'll be back in a bit folks.
[10:38:58] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: either way, the scroll bar inline with the element is 0 pixels from the top in my example.
[10:41:38] <Hewmanz> http://pastebin.com/CAJTyZR2
[10:41:45] <matzinho> good evening everybody
[10:41:52] <Hewmanz> I cannot set that data value
[10:41:55] <Hewmanz> why?
[10:42:28] <Kambfhase> Hewmanz: .data() does not create a data-* attribute
[10:42:37] <Hewmanz> so?
[10:42:41] <Hewmanz> how can I get it?+
[10:43:06] <matzinho> I can't execute a form submit button a second time. Is there anyone who had the same problem?
[10:43:11] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/8cr5C/
[10:43:35] <Kambfhase> use .attr('data-foo','value').
[10:44:00] <Kambfhase> Hewmanz: atricle from yesterday about .data(): http://thinkco.de/jquery-data-considered-potentially-harmful/
[10:44:37] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: you're asking about the wrong thing. you're still asking about the <iframe> element. not about its contents. guess what, no matter where you scroll in that iframe, the iframe itself is still 0 pixels from its containing scrollbar top.
[10:45:02] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: so what should I be asking?
[10:45:09] <Hewmanz> Kambfhase: thank you so much man
[10:45:12] <Hewmanz> Works ok
[10:45:16] <Kambfhase> pn
[10:45:19] <Kambfhase> np
[10:45:36] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/8cr5C/1/ @ darkfrog  you were super close.
[10:46:07] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: ah, thanks a lot. :)
[10:46:17] <NoiseEee> np
[10:48:35] <ericandrewlewis> if i were to make a really big modal for a contact form (maybe 2000px long), any suggestions on a library?
[10:48:45] <matzinho> I can't execute a form submit button a second time. Is there anyone who had the same problem?
[10:48:53] <jhoffmcd> I feel like im getting close, its not building the array correctly, im just getting the last iteration of info http://jsfiddle.net/JesseMCD/JQsJk/2/
[10:53:13] <Kambfhase> jhoffmcd: you are doing it wrong.
[10:54:31] <Kambfhase> jhoffmcd: http://jsfiddle.net/JQsJk/3/
[10:54:35] <jhoffmcd> Kambfhase, still getting used to jquery, trying to get an array of values for each html p element
[10:55:34] <duch_busy> jhoffmcd if you want named array indexes, you don't want an array.  period.  you cannot push using that scenario.
[10:56:29] <jhoffmcd> Kambfhase, thats exactly what i was looking for
[10:56:51] <Kambfhase> :)
[10:56:53] <jhoffmcd> duch_busy in this case i dont need named array indexes
[10:57:04] <jhoffmcd> Kambfhase, thanks!
[10:57:12] <Kambfhase> np
[10:57:43] <jhoffmcd> just curious though, it would be a different approach i needed each index to be an unique name?
[10:58:09] <duch_busy> jhoffmcd you're creating an array and setting each index to an object with a "title" and a "wtf"
[10:58:14] <duch_busy> err, "qty"
[10:58:24] <jhoffmcd> haha
[10:58:31] <duch_busy> hah no idea where wtf came from.
[10:58:37] <Hewmanz> http://jsfiddle.net/9XWet/
[10:58:51] <duch_busy> jhoffmcd you mean like an "associative array"?
[10:59:21] <jhoffmcd> yeah, im coming from php so im trying to understand the conceptual differences
[10:59:31] <Hewmanz> I'm sorry but to ask again but I have a problem
[11:00:06] <Hewmanz> I don't know how to quite of a div for enter in another
[11:00:23] <duch_busy> jhoffmcd http://jsfiddle.net/JQsJk/4/
[11:00:29] <Hewmanz> something like parent, hte only differenceis in another div
[11:01:25] <duch_busy> jhoffmcd in javascript, you can treat objects like you would associative arrays in other languages.
[11:01:29] <jhoffmcd> duch_busy: Okay I can totally see the difference now
[11:01:39] <jhoffmcd> yeah this makes sense
[11:02:28] <jhoffmcd> duch_busy thanks for showing me that
[11:02:42] <Kambfhase> Hewmanz: Can you rephrase what that button is supposed to do?
[11:02:53] <duch_busy> jhoffmcd in general, try to use arrays when possible since they're a helluva lot faster to iterate through, unless you want to reference things directly by name.
[11:05:56] <petethepig> duch_kazatel nevermind, I worked it out
[11:06:09] <duch_busy> petethepig good!  what was it?
[11:07:29] <Hewmanz> http://pastebin.com/5K8rvNAt
[11:08:47] <petethepig> duch_busy the thing is that having something like .toggle(function(){ return showOrHide}} would break existing functionality, which is .toggle([duration][,complete]) http://api.jquery.com/toggle/#toggle-duration-complete
[11:08:50] <Hewmanz> http://i.imgur.com/GD7xwvT.jpg
[11:08:56] <bjensen82> um can soneone please tell me why this simple example doesnt work? (Written in coffeescript). Its a simple change on select: http://jsfiddle.net/cbS9z/
[11:08:58] <Hewmanz> That generate this
[11:09:22] <duch_busy> bjensen82 could you shoot over the generated javascript
[11:09:27] <petethepig> duch_busy thanks anyway!
[11:09:46] <duch_busy> petethepig i figured it might be something like that - one of the reasons I avoid toggle()
[11:09:59] <Hewmanz> Kambfhase : so what I need to when I change the tab automatically the "Reembolso" button takes the id of that input
[11:13:44] <Kambfhase> \away
[11:16:35] <Hewmanz> solve it!!
[11:17:11] <crash1hd> what is the opposite of this str.replace(/\n/g, '<br />'); as str.replace(/<br \/>/g,'\n'); does not seem to work?
[11:18:27] <jphase> crash1hd: I think you'll have to escape <> as well so like str.replace(/\<br \/\>/g, "\n")
[11:18:48] <jphase> perhaps the space as well, and always use "" for \n or it will literally print out as \n on the screen instead of a new line
[11:19:12] <crash1hd> jphase, tried that
[11:19:57] <crash1hd> jphase, also does not work
[11:19:57] <crash1hd> hmm
[11:20:12] <MikeChelen> hi, i am trying to get ajaxStop to fire after a bunch of getJSON calls but the ajaxStop function is never getting executed
[11:20:13] <crash1hd> jphase, thanks that worked (seems that I am having an issue elsewhere) ran a jsfiddle and it worked
[11:22:20] * Velveeta steps into the room, dressed as Starchild from KISS.
[11:22:30] <Velveeta> allo gents
[11:22:52] <jphase> oi there mr. cheese, how you been?
[11:22:57] <Velveeta> busy busy busy
[11:23:12] <Velveeta> but today, fairly free, maybe i'll put some time into a github project i've had on the backburner
[11:23:23] <Velveeta> it has even less progress on it than vapor.js
[11:29:40] <jphase> ah yeah, got a few of those myself. my github is like the island of misfit toys atm
[11:30:09] <jphase> starting projects and not finishing them like an interior designer on meth
[11:38:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: have a question about github
[11:38:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> there are 2 types of "publishing"
[11:38:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> how come when I create a user site
[11:39:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> my project sites stoop working
[11:39:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> *stop
[11:40:07] <afidegnum> hello
[11:40:09] <afidegnum> hello, pls I have enabled boost, varnish, and memecash on my  website and teh adsense ads are no more display, I am confused, can you please check at your end if the same situation is happening ? here is the url... http://www.mynicestore.com
[11:40:11] <jphase> not totally sure what you mean, are you talking about pulling code to a live site from a repo and then your sites stop working?
[11:42:56] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: what I normally do at work for production sites is setup a deploy key for those sites and pull the code to the live site with the deploy key. If the repos are setup properly there should be no reason for anything to break. Often times when things break after pulling it's because a config file is in the repo somewhere rather than being added to .gitignore :
[11:44:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase okay. ill explain in greater depth later i have a place to be at
[11:45:43] <f0ster> why can't i trigger an event ? from inside a function that was bound to a different elements click event?
[11:45:47] <f0ster> trigger a click event*
[11:46:33] <duch_busy> f0ster have some sample code?
[11:47:21] <f0ster> duch_busy: i guess i can whip somethign together, it was a problem i had yesterday, basically like, $('div#one').click(function() { $('div#two').trigger('click'); }
[11:47:24] <f0ster> div two wouldnt get clicked
[11:47:45] <duch_busy> f0ster a working jsfiddle is invaluable in cases like these.
[11:48:30] <duch_busy> f0ster that being said, that code should work, though prepending those IDs with "div" is completely unnecessary.
[11:51:08] <f0ster> just a sample
[11:51:17] <f0ster> writing a fiddle quick
[11:51:22] <duch_busy> f0ster you can trigger another even from within the first even.
[11:51:27] <duch_busy> *event
[11:53:47] <f0ster> duch_busy: strange, simple case not reproducing problem i had yesterday
[11:54:06] <f0ster> well, it isnt exactly the same, it was on a radio button change event, trying to click a label
[11:54:15] <Velveeta> fixed!
[11:55:48] <pacmanfan> i am trying to get a stylized tooltip working, with jquery tools
[11:55:56] <pacmanfan> i could also use jqueryui i guess
[11:56:14] <pacmanfan> but it's been like 3 years since i've worked with jquery, so i am pretty rusty
[11:56:31] <pacmanfan> i can't get the code to fire
[11:57:08] <pacmanfan> i am using the code from here: http://jquerytools.org/demos/tooltip/dynamic.htm
[11:57:21] <pacmanfan> i put it on this page: http://engraveacrete.com/shop/stain-test.html
[11:57:52] <pacmanfan> and i'm starting it like this: http://pastebin.com/d7BQRxaL
[11:58:26] <Rashad> Hello.
[11:58:35] <pacmanfan> i don't even remember how to troubleshoot this with firebug :(
[11:59:02] <Rashad> The browser is caching my website, but some stuff I am loading using the .load() method are not being cached.
[11:59:46] <Rashad> I googled "jquery .load and caching" and I got results of people trying to /stop/ .load from caching: "ajax - Stop jQuery .load response from being cached - Stack Overflow"
[12:00:04] <Rashad> So it seems that .load() supports caching by default.
[12:00:19] <Rashad> So why doesn't this happen in my site? Who is to blame here?
[12:00:32] <Rashad> jQuery or perhaps my HTTP server?
[12:01:05] <NoiseEee> Rashad: what? you do or do not want caching?
[12:01:25] <Rashad> I do want caching.
[12:02:27] <NoiseEee> if for some reason you want to have your XHR responses caching, then don't use .load(), use the equivalent $.get/$.ajax and explicitly allow caching. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:02:50] <NoiseEee> Rashad: in general though, why would you want to query a server via xhr if you werent looking for a live response?
[12:03:43] <Rashad> Because I want to replace <body></body> with a new one without "leaving the page."
[12:04:09] <NoiseEee> okay
[12:05:46] <Rashad> So why were people asking to stop .load caching? Did this change with newer versions and the questions are outdated?
[12:11:50] <Rashad> NoiseEee: It's still not caching.
[12:13:40] <NoiseEee> Rashad: what do you mean by people askign to stop load caching?
[12:13:45] <NoiseEee> Rashad: in general, one xhr's for NEW content
[12:13:54] <Rashad> "ajax - Stop jQuery .load response from being cached - Stack Overflow"
[12:14:12] <Rashad> NoiseEee: what does that mean?
[12:14:17] <NoiseEee> Rashad: if you know/have ready the content you're waiting to 'load', why not just put it in a JS variable and sub it in when you're ready
[12:15:28] <Rashad> NoiseEee: it's HTML with <script> tags. You think that would still work?
[12:16:06] <Rashad> Actually I can't do that for maintainability reasons.
[12:16:12] <Rashad> Or I prefer not to.
[12:16:31] <duch_busy> Rashad are you using a server-side language of some kind?
[12:16:43] <Rashad> Yes, js using node.js
[12:17:21] <Rashad> Is it a server problem?
[12:17:31] <duch_busy> why not import the individual pages into a master page to keep maintainability?
[12:17:38] <duch_busy> set the var on that master page to the content you import.
[12:18:01] <Rashad> The idea is that I don't want the user to load something he doesn't want.
[12:19:00] <NoiseEee> like 'the next page' or something?
[12:19:18] <Cache_Money> What's the most efficient way to find the name and number from these <li>'s?   http://jsfiddle.net/V3BSh/
[12:19:21] <NoiseEee> and if they've never been to that 'next page', what does 'I WANT CACHING' even mean to you, Rashad?
[12:20:46] <Rashad> It's a chat app like omegle.com. Omegle does what you are suggesting: "load everything when the user comes even if he is not going to use all of it."
[12:21:36] <duch_busy> Cache_Money will the ID of the LI always be the player number?
[12:21:36] <Rashad> But I would like to load text-only or with-video features on demand.
[12:21:48] <NoiseEee> Rashad: okay, and what does 'caching' mean to you?
[12:22:15] <Cache_Money> duch_busy: yeah
[12:22:22] <NoiseEee> Rashad: its wayyy less expensive to build a view based on things already loaded than to xhr to get them
[12:22:49] <Cache_Money> duch_busy: I was wondering how to select the two <span>'s within the each() funciton
[12:22:52] <Rashad> Caching means that if .load(content.html) is called again with the same "content.html", the browser doesn't download the "content.html" again.
[12:23:08] <duch_busy> http://jsfiddle.net/V3BSh/1/
[12:23:08] <NoiseEee> Rashad: understand that if Jimmy's browser chooses the "text" option, and then Jane goes to the site (for the first time) and chooses the "text" option, that she is not doing anything via a cache
[12:23:13] <duch_busy> Cache_Money check that out.
[12:23:39] <Cache_Money> duch_busy: sweet!
[12:23:40] <Cache_Money> thanks
[12:23:49] <duch_busy> Cache_Money the one for "name" is what you were specifically looking for.
[12:24:27] <Rashad> NoiseEee: what I want is that when either Jimmy or Jane come back to the site and choose the text option, that they do not have to load the stuff again.
[12:24:37] <Rashad> This already happens with my main index.html page.
[12:25:57] <NoiseEee> Rashad: great, but if you're going to send any parameters along with get request, ie: "fetchPage.html?option=text" that it will not be cached at all, ever (afaik)
[12:25:59] <samholmes> Does .val() invoke a change event to an input?
[12:26:27] <Rashad> I am not sending parameters.
[12:26:34] <Rashad> Hmm.
[12:27:39] <NoiseEee> Rashad: yeah i'm stumped too, provided you're sending the proper cache directives in your responses, ie: page expiry stuff
[12:27:44] <Rashad> This is how my code was before I came here: $('body').load('chat.html');
[12:28:03] <Rashad> Now it does the same thing but using more lines through the $.ajax method
[12:28:49] <NoiseEee> lol
[12:28:53] <Rashad> Now it is like this: 		$.ajax({url: "chat.html", cache: false}).done(function( html ) {$("body" ).html( html );});
[12:29:04] <NoiseEee> and you're not sending back expired headers from chat.html?
[12:29:11] <Rashad> Oops! cache:true*
[12:29:30] <Rashad> I tried cache:true, just pasted the wrong code in here.
[12:29:45] <Rashad> And it is still not caching.
[12:30:23] <Rashad> Btw this code is inside a function called connect(), and the function is called when the user presses a certain button on the page.
[12:30:37] <NoiseEee> and again, 'chat.html' is sending cachable info?  ie: expires in the future, etc
[12:30:45] <Rashad> How do I know if I am sending back expired headers from chat.html or not?
[12:30:52] <NoiseEee> look at 'em
[12:30:55] <Rashad> Where?
[12:31:05] <NoiseEee> in your debugger
[12:31:18] <NoiseEee> ie: chrome dev tools / firebug /etc

[12:35:04] <duch_busy> yaaar why not use css for this instead?
[12:35:10] <NoiseEee> that is essentially saying "DONT EVER CACHE THIS"  ;)
[12:35:33] <Rashad> How do I change that header?
[12:36:02] <NoiseEee> Rashad: via your server / whatever node is using as a server

[12:38:11] <aberrant> oh, crap
[12:38:12] <aberrant> I got it.
[12:38:13] <aberrant> sorry
[12:38:34] <duch_busy> yaaar block elements automatically scale to fit their children.
[12:38:44] <duch_busy> unless you limit them otherwise.
[12:39:43] <yaaar> well the screen size is the limit. I want to float the children and scroll right to see more posts, not have them float under when the screen isnt wide enough
[12:40:04] <duch_busy> aaaah.

[12:43:45] <yaaar> been trying for hours
[12:43:48] <yaaar> :S
[12:44:01] <duch_busy> do you know any javascript?
[12:44:13] <grafi> i do
[12:44:16] <grafi> wohoooo
[12:45:34] <yaaar> not really, I'm a huge noob. Usually i'm able to google my problems, but not in this case
[12:46:36] <duch_busy> I'd suggest learning it :) go pick up "javascript: the definitive guide" for a great book.
[12:47:02] <GuyFreakz> Hello... :)
[12:47:26] <duch_busy> good afternoon.
[12:47:35] <GuyFreakz> I need some help for my project
[12:47:36] <jphase> hi
[12:47:39] <yaaar> I'll put it on my christmas-list, maybe someone still needs to buy me a present ;)

[12:48:29] <GuyFreakz> okay, here we go... i want to select all text in my textbox
[12:48:57] <duch_busy> GuyFreakz do you have any sample code?
[12:49:07] <GuyFreakz> when i click on it...
[12:49:38] <GuyFreakz> yes, $('#mytext').click($(this).select());
[12:49:47] <duch_busy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5797539/jquery-select-all-text-from-a-textarea
[12:49:54] <duch_busy> look at the jQuery version.
[12:50:11] <GuyFreakz> okay thank duch_busy ^^
[12:50:17] <duch_busy> not a problem.
[12:53:16] <Rashad> NoiseEee: how much should the "max-age" be?
[12:54:47] <NoiseEee> Rashad: if you're using Express, i'd just go straight to googling about how to set headers with Express (or whatever Node server you're building on) and it'd lead you in the right direction.   afaik, you should probably just leave 'max-age' off completely, and just set an 'expires' header, but i'm not positive
[12:54:58] <Rashad> No I mean, the actual value.
[12:55:08] <Rashad> Instead of the 0.
[12:57:01] <NoiseEee> Rashad: don't see it at all
[12:57:09] <NoiseEee> Rashad: http://www.mobify.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-http-cache-headers/ good luck :)

[13:14:03] <Hishi> hello ppl.
[13:14:28] <joroci> hey
[13:15:01] <Hishi> How are everyone in this channel today?
[13:15:26] <jphase> swell thx :]
[13:15:48] <lasha> GUYS
[13:16:07] <lasha> I can't for the life of me figure out why Masonry isn't fading in my elements
[13:16:19] <lasha> the grid alignments works perfectly, just want them to fade!!
[13:16:32] <Hishi> Im having alitle issue with getting out the data from a home made object (created with objname = {}) could some one shine some light on it?
[13:17:50] <jphase> Hishi: want to whip up a jsfiddle with your object and how you're trying to access the data?
[13:18:46] <Rashad> NoiseEee: thanks.
[13:18:51] <NoiseEee> Rashad: yep no prob :)
[13:19:10] <Hishi> jphase im doing it as we speak. :-P
[13:19:55] <Hishi> is there any rules agains live urls? i got my problem up on the net already.
[13:20:25] <jphase> nope
[13:20:25] <NoiseEee> Hishi: only if you know, you want 828 people hitting the site etc
[13:20:28] <BillCriswell> Hishi: You mean to like demonstrate an issue?
[13:20:46] <NoiseEee> Hishi: in general the recommendation is to present a working, reduced test-case at jsfiddle
[13:20:50] <snover> NoiseEee: i am going to hit it so much harder than that
[13:21:01] <NoiseEee> `ts
[13:21:01] <b-ot> NoiseEee: That's Sexual™
[13:21:02] <BillCriswell> I'm going to hit that shit two times.
[13:21:36] <jphase> lulz
[13:21:39] <Hishi> we could turn it around also. Ill get all of your IP adresses for those that enter. (just saying) :-P
[13:21:41] <lasha> I can't for the life of me figure out why Masonry isn't fading in my elements
[13:21:47] <lasha> am i supposed to set some default CSS?
[13:21:50] <lasha> ??
[13:22:05] <BillCriswell> lasha: There's some CSS that comes with it I think...
[13:24:01] <lasha> BillCriswell: nope not for hiding/showing
[13:26:18] <jphase> lasha: are you appending them with their "Infinity-Scroll"?
[13:26:57] <lasha> nope it's just super basic implement
[13:27:05] <lasha> container > img elements
[13:27:20] <lasha> $(container).masonry({gutter: 10})
[13:27:22] <lasha> that's it
[13:27:53] <lasha> i tried visibleStyle and hiddenStyle keys
[13:27:56] <lasha> didn't work.
[13:28:25] <jphase> hmm, I thought it did that on it's own. You tried adding a css transitions to the elements?
[13:28:41] <lasha> ummmmmm
[13:28:43] <lasha> huh?
[13:29:37] <jphase> hmm, if you don't know what I'm talking about then nevermind heh
[13:41:09] <lasha> ok here it is http://jsfiddle.net/2B435/
[13:41:18] <lasha> how do i make the images fade it on load
[13:44:12] <Hishi> my problem is that i dont get the affected rows (when you mouse over) to turn back to their original color on mouseleave http://jsfiddle.net/5L55F/
[13:45:45] <Hishi> the ide was to have the "mouseenter" event to populate a array or object with what rows (the id should be there somewere) and when you "mouseleave" it should reset those rows with the saved value of the color...
[13:46:21] <duch_busy> hishi why do things like this - $(old_background).extend({ "id":comp_id, "color": $(this).css("background-color") });
[13:46:33] <duch_busy> you don't need to use extend in cases like that.
[13:47:20] <drager> How can I change the offset of a div if a div already exist with that class?
[13:47:27] <Hishi> duch_kazatel, to be honest. I have no ide. Ive tried different things and that was one that worked. :-P any pointers is much appriciated
[13:47:41] <drager> More or less, stack divs and move them abit down and to the right.
[13:47:50] <BillCriswell> Oh shit I get distracted so fast.
[13:48:04] <duch_kazatel> Hishi how familiar are you with vanilla javascript?
[13:48:48] <Hishi> id say i have some fair knowledge but its a few years since i last used it so... its deep down somewere. :-P
[13:58:22] <joroci> remember how to do async while :P?
[13:58:57] <Hishi> hum. nope dont think i ever done that tbh.
[13:59:46] <joroci> its ok
[14:02:12] <Hishi> ive noticed that I'm not even remembering the most basic stuff... i should prob go find my old books and freshen up my memories.
[14:03:16] <joroci> i don't know if it's basic
[14:03:25] <joroci> just a nice trick
[14:04:23] <pacmanfan> anyone here use jQuery Tools?
[14:04:51] <Hishi> na i ment that i cant even remember how to get my values out of objects and arrays and such basic stuff. :-P
[14:05:05] <joroci> oh ya that's a problem
[14:05:18] <Hishi> Maybe those mushrooms wasnt such a good ide. :-P
[14:05:22] <pacmanfan> i'm wondering if it's a problem that i don't have jquery bound to $
[14:05:35] <pacmanfan> and if that's why jquery tools isn't working for me
[14:05:55] <RobOakes> Is there a way to modify what criteria $.ajax looks for in a successful response? Right now, $.ajax requests are failing because there is no JSON snippet returned.
[14:06:09] <RobOakes> I'm not able to modify the server behavior, so it's something I would need to change on the client side.
[14:06:24] <duch_kazatel> RobOakes is the server returning an error code?
[14:06:44] <RobOakes> No, the server side is returning a status 201. jQuery is interpreting this as an error, though.
[14:06:56] <RobOakes> It seems to be a case of this behavior: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17238894/jquery-file-uploader-just-sending-one-chunk
[14:07:47] <duch_kazatel> RobOakes check this out
[14:07:47] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12410051/how-to-handle-ajax-201
[14:09:10] <RobOakes> duch_kazatel: Thanks, this looks like it will work for me :)
[14:16:28] <pacmanfan> and does anyone know what version of jquery the latest jquery tools requires?
[14:16:35] <pacmanfan> i can't find it specified anywhere.
[14:19:49] <FutureTense> can someone look at this view and tell me why I'm getting an error when calling the owlCarosuel function in the ready function?  I suspect the javascript isnt loading properly
[14:19:51] <FutureTense> http://bpaste.net/show/EAWmXcIyyU3nn4pn4AyV/
[14:20:06] <amb1s1> Hi Everybody, I have this code
[14:20:08] <amb1s1> http://codepen.io/neagle/pen/Bdhmb
[14:20:27] <duch_kazatel> FutureTense what error are you getting?
[14:20:37] <amb1s1> I would like to know how would I be able to expand all sections
[14:21:07] <FutureTense> unahdled exception, object doesnt support property or method owlCarusel
[14:21:46] <duch_kazatel> sounds like the carousel code isn't loading correctly in the first place.
[14:21:49] <amb1s1> I want to to have all of the section expand when the page load
[14:22:29] <FutureTense> how can I tell?
[14:23:01] <duch_kazatel> FutureTense the other thing to check is to make sure your selector is working.
[14:23:28] <FutureTense> you mean the $("#owl-demo") part?
[14:23:33] <duch_kazatel> yes
[14:25:32] <FutureTense> no, the selector is working
[14:25:42] <FutureTense> I replaced it with $("#owl-demo").html('foobar'); and that worked
[14:25:45] <duch_kazatel> can you setup a working jsfiddle example?
[14:26:07] <FutureTense> uh.. dont know how :(
[14:26:12] <FutureTense> have to learn that
[14:26:13] <duckgoose> $( "*" ).stop( true, true );
[14:26:30] <duckgoose> this is going to stop all animations right
[14:26:40] <joroci> can you check if the script loaded properly?
[14:26:48] <FutureTense> how?
[14:26:56] <FutureTense> im guessing thats the issue
[14:27:00] <joroci> check for errors in the developer console
[14:27:05] <duch_kazatel> FutureTense the docs say ". Class "owl-carousel" is mandatory to apply proper styles that come from owl.carousel.css file. "
[14:27:17] <FutureTense> hmmm
[14:29:09] <amb1s1> can anybody help me with my demo
[14:29:10] <amb1s1> http://codepen.io/neagle/pen/Bdhmb
[14:30:24] <duch_kazatel> amb1s1 what's the question?
[14:30:46] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone has used the twitter post fetcher sscript? I'm trying to the sample code for find where the autho puts the account ID, but is impossible!! Help please!
[14:31:02] <amb1s1> I'm trying to figure out how to expand all of the sections when load
[14:31:28] <amb1s1> and when click at example section 1, section 1 on the right and left close
[14:32:47] <amb1s1> well when click, I want to show when is hide and when hide when it show
[14:33:38] <joroci> you can add a class to the divs
[14:34:02] <joroci> and then do  ('divs').slideDown(); on load
[14:35:08] <amb1s1> I try that way, but there is a look and smooth that I like on accordion
[14:35:33] <amb1s1> is there a way on my current code that I can accomplish what I want.
[14:36:03] <duch_kazatel> amb1s1 i wouldn't suggest doing an animation like that on load.
[14:36:52] <amb1s1> I just want to be expand
[14:37:12] <RobOakes> I'm modifying a jQuery upload plugin to better my company, and I'm seeing  $.post callbacks fire immediately after the request is made with an error status. The actual request goes on to complete successfully. Why might the .done, .error, and .always callbacks fire prematurely?
[14:37:30] <RobOakes> (The request is a CORS put request.)
[14:37:50] <gremlyn> here's a head scratcher... I have a click event setup looking for $("a:contains('BOOK NOW)"), and when I console.log('logged') I get output, but when I try to output $(this).attr('href'), I get nothing. works fine in a fiddle
[14:37:58] <RobOakes> The textStatus reported is 0.
[14:38:20] <gremlyn> but if I append arbitrary text to the front of the real code, it does output
[14:41:27] <Kambfhase> ?p @ gremlyn
[14:41:55] <gremlyn> supposed to be a bot action attached to that?
[14:42:02] <Kambfhase> yeah.
[14:42:05] <gremlyn> heh
[14:42:12] <Kambfhase> dammit, b-ot
[14:42:25] <Kambfhase> could you paste some code?
[14:42:53] <gremlyn> well this works like I expect: http://jsfiddle.net/TheGremlyn/vkf7W/
[14:43:12] <gremlyn> when I run it on the live site, nada...
[14:43:23] <gremlyn> http://www.hotelteatro.com/
[14:43:36] <gremlyn> any of the book now links should log the query string
[14:43:40] <gremlyn> but aren't
[14:44:45] <Kambfhase> ok, Ill have a look
[14:48:39] <FutureTense> how can I upload a js file to jsfilddle?
[14:50:03] <Kambfhase> gremlyn: Got it. :)
[14:50:08] <gremlyn> do tell
[14:50:28] <Kambfhase> Your script totally work, except for the first button.
[14:50:51] <gremlyn> oooo
[14:50:52] <Kambfhase> On that very first button you wrote 'Book Now' instead of 'BOOK NOW'
[14:50:59] <Kambfhase> case sensitive ;)
[14:51:02] <gremlyn> stupid case sensitivity
[14:51:08] <petey> http://jsbin.com/UROhUMI/1/ I have this mega menu set up I need to work with. Right now all the jquery is hardcoded for the 4 different mega menu links
[14:51:24] <gremlyn> do I just need to create two functions, or can I make the selector case insensitive
[14:51:24] <petey> I'm trying to combine all that jquery, can anyone help me figure out how I can match these against classes, I'd assume?
[14:52:35] <petey> Could it be a bunch of if statements? if($(this).hasClass('one') -> mega-menu one.slideDown, etc?
[14:52:49] <Kambfhase> gremlyn: you could do $('a.button').filter(function(){ return /book now/gi.test($(this).text(); }).click(...)
[14:53:13] <gremlyn> maybe multiple selectors would work?
[14:53:21] <gremlyn> didn't know you could do that in jquery
[14:53:26] <gremlyn> http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[14:54:41] <Kambfhase> Yeah, you could also do two queries and join them. pick what ever you like the most
[14:54:54] <gremlyn> thanks for taking look! :)
[14:55:35] <Kambfhase> :D
[14:55:46] <Kambfhase> Yet another soul saved
[15:02:07] <Hamburglr> is anyone fixing the jquerymobile themeroller?
[15:04:18] <petey> Would I use a switch or an else if for 4 items? I'm check for a class
[15:04:29] <petey> if (hassCLass) do this,
[15:04:32] <petey> hasClass*
[15:04:50] <duch_kazatel> petey I'd use else ifs.
[15:07:08] <petey> http://jsbin.com/UROhUMI/1/edit duch_kazatel? is that appropriate?
[15:07:23] <petey> I can't change the HTML structure so I'm just trying to be efficient
[15:08:16] <duch_kazatel> petey I'd cache your selectors instead.
[15:09:26] <duch_kazatel> also, petey - I'd look at event delegation.
[15:09:49] <petey> Cache my selectors?
[15:10:02] <petey> var $professionals = $('.mega-menu.professionals');
[15:10:08] <petey> or cache just the mega menu selector and run .find()
[15:10:18] <duch_kazatel> petey let me take a crack at this.
[15:15:00] <duch_kazatel> petey so here's one thing to try: http://jsbin.com/UROhUMI/5/edit
[15:15:02] <petey> Yay duch_kazatel, teach me somethign new!
[15:15:50] <duch_kazatel> petey the other thing I'd wonder is if these classes ("one", "two", etc) are unique on each LI.
[15:15:56] <petey> yes they are
[15:16:02] <petey> there are only 4 classes for this menu
[15:16:09] <petey> Do you recommend using .on() instead of .click?
[15:16:12] <duch_kazatel> are those the only classes each item would get?
[15:16:13] <petey> is it because .click calls .on()?
[15:16:25] <petey> Yes, you can call those hard-coded if that's the right way to put it
[15:16:42] <duch_kazatel> i used the event delegation version of .on()
[15:17:14] <petey> Ok. that's something I'll have to read up on then
[15:17:43] <duch_kazatel> all right, I've got another version incoming one sec.
[15:18:53] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/UROhUMI/6/edit
[15:18:53] <Guest13676> ajpiano: hi! just passed to say hi :D
[15:19:08] <duch_kazatel> petey check this out.
[15:19:48] <petey> Sorry I was reading up on event delegation
[15:19:52] <duch_kazatel> petey totally fine.
[15:19:53] <petey> Wow there's like nothing left, lol
[15:20:25] <duch_kazatel> petey yeah look through that and see if it all makes sense.
[15:22:09] <petey> Damn, it just clicked
[15:22:19] <duch_kazatel> good!
[15:22:38] <petey> this is awesome, I love nice code. Thank you duch_kazatel, really.
[15:23:07] <duch_kazatel> this minimizes the lookups - each time you run $(this).find() or anything like that, jquery is going back and looking.  minimize that and store that cointent when appropriate.
[15:23:24] <petey> so .attr('') looks for the data attribute class="" I'm assuming then right
[15:23:28] <petey> that was the part I didn't quite get
[15:24:13] <duch_kazatel> class is not a data attribute.
[15:24:25] <duch_kazatel> class is just a plain old attribute.
[15:25:07] <duch_kazatel> attr() is a method that looks up the value of the specified attribute, so attr('class') will tell you what classes that element has.
[15:27:32] <petey> Oh okay
[15:27:37] <petey> thanks again!
[15:27:42] <duch_kazatel> not a problem.
[15:28:58] <testIR> I have a little bit of a jQuery-ui (sortable) problem anyone here that knows somethings about sortable? Should i post a js fiddle?
[15:33:17] <testIR> http://jsfiddle.net/TM3mK/ - This is my sortable page.. Now when i try to move a plugin, he moves the divs that is the containers, and that i dont want.. Anyone have a clue how i can do this ?
[15:35:17] <petey> hey duch_kazatel, if you're still here. How does it remove the class from the other links?
[15:35:31] <petey> there is no .removeClass() to remove it from the other pair
[15:35:58] <duch_kazatel> let me look
[15:36:25] <duch_kazatel> oh I didn't add that part.
[15:37:27] <petey> I'm assuming for the <a> I would just do $this.removeClass('active') before it finds the class we're looking for
[15:37:53] <duch_kazatel> petey I accidentally set it to ADD that class-.
[15:37:56] <petey> and then switch mega menus from .css(background) to addclass(red) /removeclass(red)
[15:37:58] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/UROhUMI/8/edit
[15:38:33] <petey> Ah that one never adds the .keff class at all the links
[15:38:42] <petey> I tried changing it to toggleClass('') but you have to click on it twice
[15:38:57] <duch_kazatel> ah so you need all anchors in that nav to get it?
[15:39:17] <petey> the background turns black on wahtever link you're on
[15:39:25] <testIR> I need them to be like "containers"
[15:39:43] <petey> the black is only on the active link
[15:39:56] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.
[15:40:26] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/UROhUMI/12/edit
[15:40:28] <duch_kazatel> like that?
[15:40:52] <petey> Yup
[15:40:58] <petey> well replaced removeClass with addClass
[15:41:05] <petey> but yes, that is it
[15:41:16] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/UROhUMI/14/edit
[15:41:18] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[15:41:19] <duch_kazatel> derp
[15:41:39] <petey> if we're already doing event delegation on .main-navigation with .on('click')
[15:41:51] <petey> can you do a .find('a').removeClass()
[15:41:57] <petey> or do you have to call the selector all over again
[15:42:03] <petey> like you did in your latest example
[15:42:22] <duch_kazatel> petey the current context is the li, so I can't $this.find() for the others.
[15:42:32] <petey> Oh ok
[15:42:34] <duch_kazatel> actually i could do this.
[15:42:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/UROhUMI/16/edit
[15:43:37] <petey> ah wow
[15:43:39] <petey> that's interestin g
[15:43:49] <duch_kazatel> you can select via that class and then remove it :)
[15:44:31] <petey> Alright duch_kazatel, I'm going to leave you alone for a bit, lol. Thanks alot for your help!
[15:59:28] <sayd> anyone know how to get smartbanner to show on ios after they are closed
[16:01:22] <duch_kazatel> sayd like, show it again?
[16:07:44] <sayd> yes duch_kazatel
[16:08:29] <duch_kazatel> aren't those for ios apps?
[16:09:26] <sayd> they appear in safari ios when you have a apple-itunes-app meta header, they link to the itunes store or the app if its installed
[16:11:26] <duch_kazatel> ah.  I'd go ask a channel about iOS apps or HTML or something similar - they might be able to hlep you better than we can.
[16:13:53] <sayd> yeah ive tried #web, #iphonedev and here.. noone seems to know
[16:15:16] <duch_kazatel> folks here probably wouldn't know since it's #jquery :)
[16:18:04] <sayd> hmm, why is #jquerymobile invite only
[16:21:12] <duch_kazatel> iono.  maybe devs only - they probably can't help you either.
[16:33:43] <rJaspur> hi jquery experts online?
[16:35:19] <rJaspur> when you have a function like this: $('.popup').magnificPopup(). how can i make that in to a $(document).on(...///, so you don't have to add it in the $(document).ready; because I'm using Ajax.
[16:43:03] <shoky> rJaspur: you should probably use the "delegate" option, initializing the plugin on a container element
[16:43:52] <shoky> e.g.  $('#container').magnificPopup({ delegate: '.popup' })
[16:46:52] <rJaspur> can't use (document)?
[16:46:56] <rJaspur> instead of container
[16:47:16] <shoky> you can, if you dont have any container
[16:47:21] <shoky> 'body' works too
[16:47:46] <shoky> but that just means you have a click event on the document element
[16:47:52] <shoky> event handler*
[16:48:32] <rJaspur> ah ok, nice
[16:48:34] <rJaspur> thnx
[16:48:49] <shoky> at least i think you can.. haven't used this plugin myself
[16:55:50] <otherj> when i try to cmd-a the zip in the zip field here, the field loses focus automatically and i can't delete it or type over it. is it the way I'm using .blur() that causes that? any suggestions to make it not do that? https://gist.github.com/majnun/0fa7e42b1544e5b47b76
[16:58:07] <otherj> (seems important to blue the user back to that field after changing the other fields, so i'm not sure "don't blur
[16:58:10] <otherj>  is viable
[16:59:01] <joro> he does need to prevent the ajax from going again
[16:59:10] <joro> there is no point of sending the same thing
[17:00:07] <otherj> is that at me joro?
[17:00:19] <joro> yea
[17:00:30] <otherj> i'm not sure if i follow. what are you suggesting?
[17:00:52] <otherj> i always want to check for a new zip via ajax if a new one is entered
[17:00:56] <joro> why do you cmd a?
[17:01:14] <joro> to copy?
[17:01:20] <otherj> because i want to select the code and delete it or type over it
[17:01:58] <joro> i don't think you need the blur
[17:05:18] <joro> and if you click any button like shift or enter the same ajax will be called over and over i would stop that
[17:06:39] <otherj> i don't follow? it's only called if the input changes and it's 5 length int
[17:08:44] <otherj> oh, and if i select and delete too
[17:08:51] <joro> keyup doesn't mean the value change
[17:08:51] <otherj> how would you go about that?
[17:09:11] <otherj> what's better than keyup to prevent that from happening?
[17:09:19] <otherj> seemed like the least bad option for this
[17:09:33] <joro> check if the value was actually changed
[17:10:19] <otherj> yeah, i was kind of hoping there was some shortcut to that outcome that you were about to describe :P
[17:10:31] <joro> hmm
[17:10:56] <otherj> actually, the script it's ajaxing uses usps data, so i could see it getting cut off in the current form with enough requests
[17:11:03] <otherj> so you're probably right that i should address it
[17:11:12] <otherj> even caching the results could be a problem with enough traffic
[17:11:50] <joro> a simple variable to hold the last input is enough
[17:12:04] <joro> or even the last input submitted
[17:12:31] <otherj> thanks
[17:12:34] <otherj> i'll see what i can come up with
[17:12:57] <joro> but that's offtopic i don't think you need blur
[17:14:00] <otherj> i think i added that because i was getting weird behavior in ie without it
[17:14:06] <otherj> i'll see about coding around that problem
[17:14:47] <joro> it's ie all time
[17:23:54] <javalover> is it possible to have a hidden tab?
[17:27:48] <duch_kazatel> javalover in the browser?
[17:27:52] <pixelpimp> yes. no!  depends what you mean by 'hidden' and 'tab.'
[19:44:00] <lianzinho> guys, any nice and trustworthy query gallery plugin to suggest?
[19:44:06] <lianzinho> *jquery
[19:49:33] <LxE> hey I'm a bit in a bind, I have a pretty significant jquery mobile/phonegap project and my lead dev is slammed on another gig, anyone avail / interested in a freelance project?
[20:09:56] <shadowbroker> does .append() do away with the jquery object that you give it? this fiddle doesnt work as i expected: http://jsfiddle.net/K5b9C/1/
[20:10:23] <shadowbroker> i want to hold the child object in a variable so i can edit styling and such later
[20:10:34] <shadowbroker> but it seems to append a copy of the child rather than the child itself?
[20:23:12] <lianzinho> shadowbroker: you have to apply it to the first element of A
[20:23:21] <shadowbroker> A[0]?
[20:23:25] <lianzinho> change to A[0].className and it will work
[20:23:26] <lianzinho> yes
[20:23:41] <shadowbroker> ah i see
[20:23:43] <shadowbroker> awesome thanks :D
[20:24:33] <lianzinho> :D
[20:24:39] <lianzinho> just wondering
[20:24:45] <lianzinho> why not use addClass ?
[20:25:07] <shadowbroker> oh no reason. i just through together a fiddle to represent the problem i was having in a larger application
[20:26:00] <lianzinho> ok
[20:30:29] <shadowbroker> hm. now to figure out why my changes arent fixing the problem XD
[20:31:04] <lianzinho> what do you really want to do?
[20:31:52] <shadowbroker> pretty much what i posted lol
[20:31:58] <shadowbroker> its probably just a typo somewhere
[20:35:26] <shadowbroker> huh
[20:35:42] <shadowbroker> it seems element[0].top doesnt work in this context?
[20:36:04] <shadowbroker> but element.css("property", "value"); works just fine
[20:36:06] <shadowbroker> strange
[20:36:43] <lianzinho> shadowbroker: I guess it depends on the kind of element....
[20:37:14] <shadowbroker> it shouldnt matter though? element[0].top = "50%" should change the style of that element
[20:37:20] <shadowbroker> regardless of how it actually ends up looking
[20:37:26] <shadowbroker> the style is never added in the first place
[20:37:33] <shadowbroker> so i'll just be switching to .css()
[20:39:03] <lianzinho> shadowbroker: that's because top is not a property of the element
[20:39:19] <shadowbroker> ?
[20:39:23] <shadowbroker> oh
[20:39:26] <shadowbroker> property != style
[20:39:28] <shadowbroker> i see
[20:39:57] <lianzinho> try
[20:40:00] <shadowbroker> well it works now :) thanks for the help
[20:40:02] <lianzinho> element.style.top
[20:40:11] <lianzinho> to help
[20:40:30] <lianzinho> adds a console.log(A) and inspect it with some web tools
[20:40:45] <lianzinho> you will be able to see all the available properties...
[20:42:55] <lianzinho> open the inspector in the console tab and take a look…. http://jsfiddle.net/K5b9C/2/
[20:43:04] <shadowbroker> ya i did that. silly me skimmed over the properties and didnt see top, but just figured it was there
[22:03:09] <decimal> what does this mean: (function ($) {
[22:03:30] <dismist> shorthand for $(document).ready(function()
[22:07:49] <tw2113> i tend to use (function($){ }(jQuery); when i add script blocks to the end of the page
[22:09:11] <jphase> yay closures!
[22:56:25] <mvpgraff> I'm tryign to get my object content to show after a click, I console.log(obj.content); and it shows the content: on my console fine, but when I try return obj.content, I get nothing. any idea? http://jsfiddle.net/bG7Hf/1/
[22:57:50] <mvpgraff> http://jsfiddle.net/bG7Hf/2/ right link sorry
[23:03:27] <mvpgraff> nvm i figured it out
[23:03:28] <mvpgraff> lol
[23:19:15] <Ebonwumon> I want to get the size of a particular piece of text measured in points.
[23:19:18] <Ebonwumon> Is that possible?
[23:19:34] <aproxy> Points? Can you not use font size?
[23:19:44] <aproxy> I.e. in css or sometihng?
[23:20:07] <Ebonwumon> .css('font-size') returns the size of the text in pixels.
[23:20:22] <Ebonwumon> Which is fine normally, but I'm getting it to put into another library, and it only takes font size in points.
[23:20:26] <aproxy> Aha.
[23:20:48] <aproxy> var points = parseInt(fontSize) * 72 / 96
[23:20:57] <aproxy> Stackoverflow after a quick google.
[23:21:00] <aproxy> Hope it works
[23:21:26] <aproxy> Or even: (parseFloat($(this).css("font-size")) * 72.0 / 96.0).toFixed(2)
[23:21:54] <Ebonwumon> yaaaaaaaaay magic numbers.
[23:22:05] <aproxy> woohoo!
[23:22:13] <aproxy> Just love 'em
[23:22:48] <aproxy> using PHP GD? it's got an internal DPI of 96 so it'll work
[23:24:16] <Ebonwumon> lol
[23:24:20] <Ebonwumon> So I *think* it worked
[23:24:41] <Ebonwumon> It's just *slightly* off, but I think there might be a quarter of an em of padding somewhere messing wtih my calculations
[23:26:29] <aproxy> Goody
[23:26:42] <aproxy> Mess with the numbers till it works ;)
[23:29:50] <Ebonwumon> Oh god this is such an incredibly frustrating issue. The font has a bit of "whitespace" above each line.
[23:30:15] <Ebonwumon> CSS measures positions from the top of the blocks of text, but my PHP library measures from the bottom of the text
[23:30:40] <Ebonwumon> So if I just add the height, the actual position is slightly off from my preview because of the difference in spacing above and below the lines.
