[00:00:13] <rootboy_> I've been trying to use HowlerJS but it won't sync correctly, so I went back to HTML-5 Audio but the following example won't loop without a gap: http://www.klaiss.org/asyncart/index-preload.html
[00:01:01] <robertmaxrees> I'm going to guess you want ##javascript here.
[00:02:15] <rootboy_> May I ask for your help, please. It's for a ambitious art project and the entire web seems to be missing a proper looping of HTML-5 audio. I would take JavaScript as well.
[00:02:31] <robertmaxrees> This isn't really related to jquery, sadly.
[00:02:39] <robertmaxrees> so i don't think we'll be much help./
[00:04:44] <rootboy_> I see. Well, thanks for the quick reply. I will be staying on for a little longer in case anybody wants to help with this.
[00:04:53] <robertmaxrees> :/
[00:19:48] <rootboy_> FYI: It's only about that looping. I have another example where you can set a ton of really fun loops. The final product will be on the Blockchain.
[00:45:53] <robertmaxrees> That doesn't really change my suggestion.
[00:48:01] <rootboy_> I understand. I will try to experiment some more on this and maybe join ##javascript soon. Thanks for the suggestion! Nice to talk to you again!
[01:41:57] <rootboy_> Update: A possible workaround (one that will not work for me) is to use a loop that repeats itself endlessly, so that the user will only notice it after a while, but not after like let's say 8 seconds. So the idea here is to make a let's say 8 minute loop instead.
[01:45:09] <rootboy_> Another approach is to add a copy of the loop after the loop reached the end (while there are other things to take into account like fading in/out and setting something for currentTime. I just wanted to share those ideas with you in case you ever get to work with HTML-5 audio and loops.
[04:29:49] <Serj> Hello i need help
[04:31:08] <Serj> i recently tried to install firebase and etc, and i think it installed nodejs, after that the js commands stopped working and everything in the js file are not functioning. Is jquery down or...?
[04:31:57] <Serj> anyone?
[04:33:37] <Cork> code.jquery.com works fine for me
[04:33:57] <Cork> where your build tool is fetching it from migth be somewhere else though
[04:34:16] <Serj> everything is in the same folder html css js...
[04:34:49] <Serj> it just stops doing what the .js is supposed to do
[04:35:18] <Cork> Serj: you would have to ask that in a channel related to your build tools
[04:35:30] <Serj> what build tools??
[04:35:41] <Cork> the one that makes you ask "is jquery down"
[04:35:59] <Serj> no I'm asking if it's down that's why it's not working?
[04:36:33] <Cork> well, if your jquery library is located locally it can't be down...
[04:36:57] <Serj> is there another way?
[04:37:13] <Cork> you haven't given me anything to answer yet...
[04:37:36] <Serj> wdym i said my issue
[04:37:37] <Cork> your doing something somewhere with something and something is not working
[04:37:48] <Cork> everything is unknown
[04:38:25] <Serj> yeah before trying to put it on firebase it was working fine then when i started installing what firebase needed(i think it also included nodejs) it stopped working
[04:38:38] <Cork> so ask in a support channel for firebase
[04:39:58] <Serj> ok i thought it might also be from jquery but u didnt end up that helpful
[04:40:01] <Serj> thanks anyways
[04:40:11] <Cork> lol
[04:40:28] <Cork> ya, it is definitely my fault i'm not psykic...
[05:01:23] <Uhkis> lol
[05:34:47] <undefined_bob> oO
[12:10:47] <Northwoods> hi , i have an existing function getUserMedia , how can i add the code given here --> https://jsfiddle.net/qu9t5wjo/ to getUserMedia funciton
[12:10:54] <Northwoods> can someone help me in this
[12:11:14] <Northwoods> need to add support for other browsers.
[13:47:39] <robertmaxrees> Northwoods you want ##javascript
[13:47:56] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, thanks
[13:55:05] <robertparkerx> I've done this before but I forgot how. There are elements like <ul> <li>item</li> <li>item <ul><li>item</li></ul> </li> </ul>
[13:55:16] <robertparkerx> when I do .text(); it gets all the text
[13:55:26] <robertparkerx> how can I get the first text from the li element
[13:56:14] <robertmaxrees> which LI?
[13:56:22] <robertparkerx> The second for example
[13:56:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/grq4y2hv/
[13:56:34] <robertmaxrees> out of "foo", "bar", and "baz", which do you want?
[13:56:51] <robertparkerx> bar
[13:57:56] <robertmaxrees> .contents could work for that.  could grab all the text in that li, then .replace() all the text from the children with an empty string, or (even better) just wrap it in a span with a class and select that instea.d
[14:04:00] <robertparkerx> wait it's wrapped <li><a href="">item></a></li> <li><a href="">item</a> <ul><li><a href="">item</a></li></ul> </li> </ul>
[14:04:34] <robertmaxrees> lol that's so hard to read as a one-liner.
[14:07:56] <robertparkerx> $(this).find('a:eq(0)').text(); worked
[14:08:15] <robertmaxrees> what is $(this) in this case?
[14:08:43] <robertmaxrees> also: i'd favor .find('a').eq(0) instead of cramming the eq into a selector fwiw.
[16:13:14] <BlackSalmon> Hi, I'm getting error when i'm trying to use Waypoints, but never played with js so idk what to change. https://jsfiddle.net/4p1hebgq/
[16:13:39] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[16:13:43] <BlackSalmon> "jquery.waypoints.min.js:7 Uncaught Error: No handler option passed to Waypoint constructor"
[16:14:15] <robertmaxrees> link to the library?
[16:14:21] <BlackSalmon> http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/
[16:15:30] <robertmaxrees> i mean, looking at that page, it wants a handler property.
[16:15:57] <robertmaxrees> also check the docs: http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/guides/getting-started/
[16:16:03] <robertmaxrees> "There are many properties you can set on this options object, but two of them are required, element, and handler."
[16:16:56] <robertmaxrees> also: i'm not seeing onBeforePageLoad and onAfterPageLoad as apart of this library.
[16:17:32] <BlackSalmon> I think those two are from infinite scrolling library
[16:17:50] <robertmaxrees> they don't belong as apart of waypoints is what i'm saying.
[16:17:53] <robertmaxrees> so ditch 'em.
[16:19:33] <robertmaxrees> ah, you mean http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/shortcuts/infinite-scroll/
[16:21:36] <BlackSalmon> It's that https://infinite-scroll.com/ but idk if there any difference between this and what you send
[16:21:58] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:22:03] <robertmaxrees> i think you're mixing things up :)
[16:22:24] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to do?
[16:22:41] <BlackSalmon> I just want add infinite scrolling to my django site D : how complicated can it be :/
[16:22:59] <robertmaxrees> well, do you have the server-side portion done?
[16:23:20] <robertmaxrees> and are you now just trying to decide on a client-side library?
[16:24:10] <BlackSalmon> I have done pagination on server-side and now i'm trying to extend that pagination to infinite scrolling
[16:24:30] <BlackSalmon> I heared that should be the easiest way
[16:24:39] <robertmaxrees> what should be the easiest way?
[16:25:38] <BlackSalmon> Do pagination in server-side in django and then just make js to load next pages as infinite scrolling
[16:25:53] <robertmaxrees> ah yeah - sounds like you just need to find a plugin to help then :)
[16:26:27] <BlackSalmon> anything that doesn't requires deep messing around js and doesn't slow down my site really hard
[16:26:29] <robertmaxrees> looks like that second link requires you to pay if you're going to use it for commercial purposes.
[16:26:52] <BlackSalmon> Oh, so i'm gonna throw it off
[16:28:03] <robertmaxrees> i mean, there are a few ways to approach this.  something like this boilerplate would be a great start https://stackoverflow.com/a/5059561/923919
[16:28:36] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, there are dozens of plugins out there that look pretty solid - just gotta find the right one for you :)
[16:30:17] <robertmaxrees> if you choose to use that snippet from SO, I'd make sure to cache those selectors so you aren't running the jquery constructor over and over.  might also throttle it, as well.
[16:31:52] <BlackSalmon> I'll look around to find something helpful, thx :)
[17:46:40] <kevinspacey> hi guys
[17:47:21] <kevinspacey> if I add a jquery element to an array, and then compare it to the source jquery element, will it be equal? is this okay to do?
[17:47:27] <kevinspacey> is it better to checksum the innerHtml?
[17:47:55] <robertmaxrees> are you just asking how to compare two jquery objects?
[17:47:57] <kevinspacey> adding an id to the element is not doable
[17:48:09] <kevinspacey> I want to check if an object was added to a list or not
[17:48:14] <kevinspacey> but without adding an id
[17:48:54] <robertmaxrees> confused haha
[17:49:35] <robertmaxrees> can you provide more context for what you're trying to do?
[17:50:50] <kevinspacey> so what I'm trying to do is subscribe to an element .on('click') event every 1 second (because it gets removed and readded via ajax), but I don't want to subscribe to it more than one time so I want to add it to a list
[17:50:58] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:50:59] <robertmaxrees> don't do that :)
[17:51:04] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[17:53:40] <kevinspacey> tried but won't work robertmaxrees
[17:53:45] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[17:54:06] <kevinspacey> it's still fired more than once
[17:54:13] <robertmaxrees> then you're calling .on() more than once.
[17:54:17] <kevinspacey> nope
[17:54:23] <robertmaxrees> yep
[17:54:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kou3hfmb/4/
[17:54:28] <robertmaxrees> fires once per element.
[17:54:40] <robertmaxrees> OR you have something strange going on with your markup.
[17:55:21] <kevinspacey> I'm selecting them by class
[17:55:30] <kevinspacey> shouldn't happen i know
[17:55:56] <robertmaxrees> issue is your setup isn't really sustainable.  so i'd get the delegated handler working properly instead.
[17:56:04] <kevinspacey> oh no so the real issue is that the element is not present during load I guess?
[17:56:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:56:15] <robertmaxrees> what element?
[17:56:20] <robertmaxrees> the parent you're binding to?
[17:56:21] <kevinspacey> it appears like 5 seconds into loading and chill, the ajax element
[17:56:22] <kevinspacey> ye
[17:56:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah - you need to bind to an ancestor that exists on pageload.
[17:57:11] <kevinspacey> i was binding it to document
[17:57:22] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[17:57:29] <robertmaxrees> can you show me what that binding looks like?
[17:57:31] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle?
[17:58:11] <robertmaxrees> also: are you maybe passing a classname in your handler that's nested maybe?
[17:58:33] <Northwoodss> var form = $('form')[1]; var form_data = new FormData(form);           I want to send form data through ajax , form id is $("#vform")
[17:58:53] <Northwoodss> how can i select all form data by form id
[17:59:13] <robertmaxrees> "select all form data by form id" Northwoodss??
[17:59:35] <Northwoodss> not select , i mean through ajax rquest
[17:59:42] <Northwoodss> send all form data
[17:59:45] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[17:59:57] <Northwoodss> with form id "vform"
[18:00:44] <robertmaxrees> you just want to post it and specify the formdata object as the 'data' property on the options.
[18:00:54] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/8244082/923919
[18:01:03] <robertmaxrees> (can ignore the file input bit, same basic concept though)
[18:01:29] <robertmaxrees> Northwoodss
[18:01:42] <kevinspacey> https://i.imgur.com/5Q8o9gM.png robertmaxrees it's subscribing to "card" like 15 times even though "main__content" only changes once
[18:01:52] <Northwoodss> robertmaxrees, i have 2 forms on this page
[18:02:01] <robertmaxrees> kevinspacey that's not how you do that.
[18:02:03] <Northwoodss> which one does it sends data of
[18:02:06] <robertmaxrees> Northwoodss make a fiddle.
[18:02:52] <robertmaxrees> kevinspacey you ARE calling .on() more than once for those .card elements.
[18:03:10] <robertmaxrees> kevinspacey you need to move that handler out of that change handler.
[18:03:15] <kevinspacey> I'm calling it only when main__content updates, which should be only once
[18:03:28] <kevinspacey> (it is only once)
[18:03:45] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: how'd you verify that?
[18:03:57] <kevinspacey> console.log :laugh:
[18:03:57] <robertmaxrees> either way, it's bad practice to nest event bindings.
[18:04:24] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', '.card', function() {}); is all you need there.
[18:04:42] <Northwoodss> robertmaxrees, by default it picks up the first form of the page var fd = new FormData();
[18:04:52] <robertmaxrees> Northwoodss fiddle pls.
[18:04:57] <robertmaxrees> Northwoodss :)
[18:05:03] <Northwoodss> :)
[18:06:40] <Northwoodss> robertmaxrees,  This is what i meant  --> new FormData(document.getElementById('form1')))
[18:06:51] <Northwoodss> new FormData(document.getElementById('form1')))
[18:06:55] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:07:35] <robertmaxrees> (can't tell if you're still confused Northwoodss)
[18:07:47] <Northwoodss> no found the solution
[18:07:52] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[18:08:06] <robertmaxrees> can also $('#foo').get(0) for the jquery way.
[18:08:16] <kevinspacey> if I bind it to document $(this) refers to document, not to the slave is there any event args that might help?
[18:08:30] <robertmaxrees> kevinspacey not if you use a delegated listener.
[18:08:52] <kevinspacey> so how do I know which one is clicked :thinking:
[18:08:56] <robertmaxrees> $(this)
[18:09:07] <kevinspacey> but $(this) returns $(document)
[18:09:10] <kevinspacey> which is the master
[18:09:18] <robertmaxrees> then you're not properly using a delegated listener.
[18:10:04] <kevinspacey> also isn't it a bit offensive that we use master/slave parent/children in programming :thinking:
[18:10:19] <robertmaxrees> is it.  there's a reason people are moving away from that terminology, myself included.
[18:10:24] <robertmaxrees> *it is, rather.
[18:10:45] <kevinspacey> wouldn't have thought about it if it wouldn't have been for the recent events lol
[18:11:32] <robertmaxrees> either way: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5moac78x/
[18:11:50] <robertmaxrees> $(this) refers to the target element specified in the second arg to .on()
[18:12:11] <robertmaxrees> so if $(this) is document in your case, something is amiss.
[18:20:19] <kevinspacey> yeah this approach won't work in my case so what's the best way of generating a guid for a div?
[18:20:29] <robertmaxrees> there isn't one lol.
[18:21:01] <kevinspacey> so cryptojs md5 innerHtml?
[18:21:25] <robertmaxrees> delegated listeners are designed specifically for cases like this.  so if they aren't working then you have other issues you need to address.
[18:21:40] <robertmaxrees> if you can share more of the actual code i'd be happy to take a look for you.
[18:22:11] <kevinspacey> I can't because it's a plugin for highly obfuscated code that's not mine
[18:22:19] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:22:38] <kevinspacey> so I can't solve the underlying problem because I'm assuming it's a feature not a bug, lol
[18:23:42] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  without much more to go on, the best i can suggest would be to set breakpoints and see if what you think is happening is actually happening.
[18:24:23] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're going to add to the obfuscation and create an even more confusion solution.
[18:24:44] <robertmaxrees> *confusing
[18:25:13] <kevinspacey> but wouldn't md5ing the innerHtml technically work?
[18:25:28] <robertmaxrees> it's a really bad idea tbh.
[18:25:40] <robertmaxrees> like, you're just creating a ton more work for yourself and leaving a bunch of bugs on the table.
[18:26:25] <robertmaxrees> calling functions that run once a second to re-bind listeners is... non-ideal.  and depending on the size of the page, there's a great chance you're going to wind up with some great memory leaks.
[18:26:58] <kevinspacey> doesn't js have a garbage collector?
[18:27:20] <robertmaxrees> it does, but it can't protect against everything :)
[18:32:07] <kevinspacey> I guess I'll just add an id, thank you so much for your time
[18:32:25] <robertmaxrees> :/
