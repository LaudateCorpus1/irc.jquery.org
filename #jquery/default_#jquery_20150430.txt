[00:03:12] <unnu> :( but screw data entry
[00:34:26] <BarnaSzalai> hi
[00:35:24] <BarnaSzalai> can I control the dragged element movement in UI Sortable? I mean I don't want to be able to move the dragged element above the list , or even to the top of screen
[00:35:54] <BarnaSzalai> strictly only in the area of the list elements
[00:59:44] <unnu> BarnaSzalai, have you taken a look at https://jqueryui.com/draggable/#constrain-movement ?
[01:01:12] <unnu> BarnaSzalai, or http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-containment
[01:35:58] <KnightsOfNi> Is it possible to attach multiple events to something in 1 line?
[01:37:18] <Kartagis> KnightsOfNi: if you stick them into an array, yeah
[01:37:28] <Uhkis> KnightsOfNi: on('click mouseover', function() {Â do stuff }
[01:37:38] <Kartagis> or that
[01:39:07] <boingo> hi there, i have a question concerning draggable of the jquery ui
[01:41:05] <boingo> i have a draggable big img inside a smaller div and define the containment for the draggable according to the parent div. Now when i reach on edge and move the mouse forward everything is fine, img stops. but when i move the mouse back it only starts moving again after i pass the point where i reached the edge.<-understandable?
[01:42:42] <boingo> say i drag left, reach the edge, move the mouse more to the left, but then i want the img to start dragging right as soon as i move the mouse to the right again. Right now i would have to pass the point where i reached the edge or release and press again.
[01:44:29] <DragonPunch> anyone wna tto 'refer' me to amazon s3 ?? for rewarsd. im about to sign up and spend money.
[02:08:10] <unnu> hey guys, is there a way to tell the difference between a user clicking a radio, vs jquery clicking a radio?
[02:08:58] <Cork> unnu: you could check isTrusted
[02:09:09] <Cork> (on the originalEvent object)
[02:09:21] <Cork> if that doesn't work no, you cna't
[02:09:24] <Cork> *can't
[02:09:38] <unnu> its that example i was working on earlier Cork
[02:09:46] <unnu> i think i just need to add a class of active
[02:09:50] <unnu> now that i am looking at it
[02:11:08] <unnu> yeah
[02:11:13] <Cork> unnu: ya, or don't fake the event
[02:11:16] <unnu> threw  $('input[name="'+entry+'"]').parent().addClass( "active" );   in a foreach
[02:11:36] <Germanaz0> Hello everybody, someone know a good custom scrollbar, that doesn't add a lot of wrappers into the container ?
[02:11:44] <unnu> i want it to "save their progress" lol
[02:15:46] <Cork> Germanaz0: replacing the scrollbar is normally a really bad idea
[02:16:07] <Germanaz0> yes, it ruins my positions fixed, relative and all
[02:16:13] <Cork> as different platforms handle scrolling very differently, so you will break the experience for some users
[02:17:04] <Germanaz0> then what do you reccomend me  ?
[02:17:18] <Cork> leave the native scrollbars in there
[02:17:24] <unnu> ^^^^^
[02:17:30] <Germanaz0> but they are ugly
[02:17:39] <Cork> they are what the user expect
[02:17:51] <Cork> functionality should always win over design, if there is a competition
[02:17:56] <unnu> scrollbars are browser dependent, why don't you write your own browser with pretty scrollbars?
[02:18:10] <Germanaz0> xD
[02:18:11] <Cork> they aren't normally even browser dependent
[02:18:14] <Cork> they are system dependent
[02:18:20] <Germanaz0> why browsers don't allow to override the css of it
[02:18:35] <Cork> Germanaz0: exactly i completely agree with that part
[02:18:41] <Cork> ie did somewhat back in the days
[02:18:45] <unnu> in that case i would like to recommend the book Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love
[02:18:51] <Cork> but sadly it haven't gotten any better
[02:19:07] <Germanaz0> yes I remember
[02:19:08] <unnu> isbn 13:978-0-672-32946-3
[02:19:17] <Germanaz0> people could override scrollbars css on old IE
[02:19:37] <Cork> well "kinda" you could control border and background color
[02:19:39] <Cork> not much else
[02:19:56] <Germanaz0> yes, and in that time, you could see "Blue" scrollbars everywhere xD
[02:19:56] <Cork> anyway the browser would have to restrict what the page could do, to not break the user experience
[02:19:59] <Germanaz0> ugly as hell
[02:20:15] <Cork> but ya, i would love having the browsers give some control of the scrollbar to the page
[02:20:26] <Cork> would take the pressure of "replace them all together"
[02:20:37] <Cork> (like google often do)
[02:20:41] <unnu> Cork, Mobile?
[02:20:51] <Germanaz0> in mobile, scrollbars are pretty
[02:20:55] <Germanaz0> small and comfortable
[02:20:58] <Cork> mobile don't have scrollbars
[02:21:07] <Cork> at least not that i've seen
[02:21:07] <unnu> lulz
[02:21:14] <Cork> they have scroll position indication blocks
[02:21:17] <Cork> not scrollbars
[02:21:23] <Cork> you can't use them for anything
[02:21:41] <Cork> except realizing you will have to swipe for ages to get to the bottom/top :/
[02:21:42] <unnu> why not the same thing, with a hover-visablity and some interaction?
[02:21:44] <unnu> boom
[02:21:57] <Cork> unnu: some systems have that
[02:22:05] <unnu> cool
[02:22:07] <unnu> lol
[02:22:08] <Cork> ubuntu unity has by default
[02:22:15] <unnu> YAY boot2
[02:22:16] <Cork> the scrollbar handle is actually outside the window
[02:22:25] <unnu> mmhmm
[02:22:28] <Germanaz0> ok, but back to my question, in the case that I have a custom scrollbar, and is breaking the fixed positions
[02:22:35] <unnu> Cork, come do my SQL for me
[02:22:36] <Germanaz0> which jquery plugins could I use, a decent one ?
[02:22:54] <Cork> Germanaz0: ya, you will have breakage, it comes with the territory
[02:23:06] <Cork> Germanaz0: you can't replace the scrollbars without breaking things
[02:23:41] <cyberbrai> how to stop bubbling in functions
[02:23:50] <Cork> unnu: http://toastytech.com/guis/ubuntu114cpls.png
[02:24:01] <cyberbrai> is there any way to stop them
[02:24:09] <Cork> bubbling in functions?
[02:24:13] <Cork> functions don't bubble
[02:24:24] <Cork> events do
[02:24:31] <cyberbrai> yes events

[02:31:28] <cyberbrai> hey Cork any help
[02:32:06] <cyberbrai> how can stop them if  i am using more then four function
[02:34:58] <Uhkis> unnu: if only there were some THE graphics library
[02:53:52] <Koopz> anyone using Datatables?
[02:57:21] <hollusion> how do you call the state of holding multiple card in your hand?
[02:57:24] <hollusion> playing cards
[02:57:31] <hollusion> card fan?
[02:58:23] <Germanaz0> Koopz: I used once
[02:58:23] <hollusion> i mean like this https://cognitiveinvesting.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/playing-cards.jpg
[02:58:47] <hollusion> i want to arrange <div> elements like this, can you help or explain how to do this?
[02:58:51] <unnu> yo Cork, you ever have to generate pdf's?
[02:58:54] <hollusion> how do i calculate the positions?
[02:58:55] <Koopz> Germanaz0, with serverside processing?
[02:59:02] <Germanaz0> PHP
[02:59:02] <Cork> unnu: ya
[02:59:05] <Germanaz0> and MySQL
[02:59:12] <unnu> pointers?
[02:59:29] <unnu> i have a template, and need to replace a name and two numbers on it based on a DB input
[02:59:31] <Cork> unnu: we're using openoffice for that
[02:59:43] <unnu> lol, i meant from web
[02:59:44] <Cork> we used to have more specified scripts for it
[02:59:48] <Cork> unnu: i did too
[02:59:54] <unnu> OH SHITE SON
[02:59:59] <unnu> openoffice you say?
[03:00:01] * unnu googles
[03:00:04] <Cork> the webserver generates xml pipes it through openoffice
[03:00:12] <Cork> and out you get .doc/.docx/odf/pdf
[03:00:24] <Cork> kinda neet
[03:00:37] <unnu> teach me oh great one
[03:00:39] <unnu> or you know, link
[03:00:40] <unnu> lol
[03:00:47] <Cork> maybe late gtg
[03:01:06] <unnu> ahh
[03:01:07] <unnu> gotchya
[03:16:03] <Koopz> eccch...
[03:17:01] <Koopz> if i use $('.foo').data({foo: 'bar'}... shouldn't i see a data attribute when inspecting with F12?
[03:19:09] <decx> first of all it's data('foo','bar') and second data attributes are just saved once on load into $._data
[03:22:06] <Koopz> .data( obj )
[03:22:20] <Koopz> added in 1.4.3
[03:22:23] <Koopz> used by Datatables
[03:23:30] <Koopz> so i won't see them if they're added after loading the page
[03:24:32] <Koopz> console proofs that the data has been added... hmmm...
[03:24:45] <decx> it's a performance thing
[03:25:13] <decx> jquery makes data much more flexible
[03:25:27] <decx> so you can use objects, elements, functions whatever
[03:25:47] <decx> if you just want to change the attribute you can use dataset directly
[03:29:03] <Koopz> i'm fine with invisible data attributes as long as i can query them... which doesn't seem to work anymore after i've switched to them
[03:29:38] <decx> you will get it faster if you query with data() and not by attributes
[03:30:56] <Sendoushi> hey guys
[03:31:19] <Sendoushi> i want to detach all children from a parent so i can append later on once again
[03:31:24] <Sendoushi> how would you do that?
[03:31:25] <pater249> bumble bee tuna
[03:32:38] <Meir`> Sendoushi, to store them in memory? or to move them somewhere else in dom?
[03:32:48] <decx> what do you want to do with the children?
[03:33:08] <Sendoushi> Meir`: to store
[03:33:25] <Koopz> i'm querying it using data()... the problem was the function querying it wasn't delegated which sucks if the elements are added after document load o3o
[03:36:26] <Meir`> Sendoushi, ok, so simply store the .children() in a var
[03:36:33] <Meir`> then perform .empty on the parent
[03:36:56] <Sendoushi> is that better than a detach? performance wisely
[03:37:03] <Sendoushi> cant i jsut... detach the children'
[03:37:42] <marcusdei> on this page: http://easywebsite.nl/voorbeeld/fortune/%E5%A4%A9%E6%B0%94/?lang=zh-hans
[03:37:56] <Meir`> Sendoushi, you can .detach
[03:38:34] <marcusdei> for every city value, i would like it translated to Simplified chinese
[03:38:41] <marcusdei> where can i find some nice jquery to do this?
[03:38:57] <mdev> whoevers op in here should be how it is, no need to add a bunch others
[03:39:00] <Meir`> Sendoushi, look at the exmaple here:
[03:39:01] <Meir`> https://api.jquery.com/detach/
[03:39:01] <mdev> thanks
[03:39:15] <Sendoushi> m'kay thanks
[03:40:02] <mdev> slashdot article recently was hating on jquery or the comments were at least, lot of them
[03:40:30] <Uhkis> mdev: link?
[03:40:43] <mdev> article was on how modern browser tech is to the point where you don't need jquery, which is non-sense IMHO, raw JS is still as dangerous and tricky as its ever been
[03:41:22] <mdev> one second
[03:41:37] <pater249> yea i am wondering why they try to silince flash
[03:41:44] <mdev> http://developers.slashdot.org/story/15/04/27/1754230/javascript-devs-is-it-still-worth-learning-jquery?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed
[03:41:51] <decx> anyone not serving to a geek audience or in education can't afford to lose out on people using old browsers in ecommerce those have some of the best conversion rates too
[03:41:57] <pater249> and went with JS instead
[03:43:11] <pater249> maybe they did not liked the nice security sand box lol
[03:43:51] <decx> if you write your own 30kb toolbelt to deal with crossbrowser shit or just serve the gzipped jquery from a cdn which is probably cached on the users box makes no difference
[03:43:55] <pater249> But Jquery is fun to
[03:44:03] <mdev> comments were saying that jquery is a great deal slower than raw JS, like document.getElementById 3 or 4 times faster, and that jquery uses eval on ajax stuff. Even if that's all true, I don't care, jquery is wonderful and makes browser js dev fast and easy, a little loss of speed is a non-issue for me
[03:44:19] <decx> ajax is the worst in native
[03:44:46] <pater249> i am not even going to learn ajax
[03:44:55] <Uhkis> lol "Apologies for the link-baiting title"
[03:44:57] <pater249> totaly unnessercary
[03:45:23] <mdev> i've done ajax in raw js, wasn't fun
[03:45:27] <pater249> excuse my english, burp
[03:46:05] <pater249> Raw JS looks like C++ to me, i hate it
[03:46:28] <decx> that's the wrong mindset
[03:48:10] <pater249> it does not make sence to me, i made a android app for a website, few months ago, that was hell to, but i finished it
[03:49:04] <mdev> congrats, I got one of the best learning android books but haven't read it yet, had it for months
[03:49:19] <Uhkis> mdev: so now it's deprecated :D
[03:49:38] <mdev> heh yeah probably with the android studio thing being mainstream now
[03:50:00] <pater249> i got allot of help, half the learning proces is back engineering
[03:50:08] <Uhkis> i wrote my thesis on android gamedev, it was half-obsolete at the time i finished it :I
[03:50:44] <pater249> video tutorials are working better here then privat teachers
[03:50:49] <mdev> i'm long overdue on learning mobdev so definitely gonna jump into it soon, android and ios
[03:51:39] <pater249> i suggest you try flash builder and eclipse for android
[03:52:32] <Uhkis> what's flash builder
[03:53:08] <decx> an early hominid tool to cut meat and skin animals
[03:53:22] <Uhkis> :D
[03:53:46] <pater249> its based on eclipse, made for adobe, you can code one project for Android iOS and blackberry apps
[03:54:18] <Uhkis> wait, so it cuts meat AND x-devs?!
[03:54:40] <pater249> Flash builder aka Flex, its perfect for future html5 plans
[03:55:15] <pater249> i am pretty sure that is the future, its not ready thoe
[03:57:14] <pater249> bumble bee tuna
[03:57:16] <Uhkis> ugh, it does mobile through air+flash?
[03:57:48] <pater249> right now i am not sure, i am a little bit behind
[03:58:13] <pater249> but i am pretty sure also we dont need flash in the future
[04:00:27] <pater249> i hope they do bring back flash, it has better security
[04:00:36] <pater249> then JS
[04:00:48] <Uhkis> you're kidding, right?
[04:01:20] <pater249> Plus they are alway nagging about displaying the same content on every device, flash will do that
[04:01:25] <pater249> Nope
[04:02:31] <pater249> Now u have to use @ media querys 3 times or more, while in flash u can do it with one line
[04:05:32] <Uhkis> too bad flash has poor performance and has to be downloaded
[04:05:52] <decx> it's compiling flash to js probably
[04:06:13] <decx> a last ditch effort by a generation of devs trying to stay relevant?
[04:06:28] <decx> something like that
[04:06:48] <Uhkis> http://flex.apache.org/about-features.html
[04:07:03] <Uhkis> sounds like it's running flash through AIR on mobile
[04:07:45] <decx> it's weird alright
[04:11:41] <deepy> iirc, flex was pretty sweet
[04:11:50] <deepy> But I can't recall why
[04:11:51] <pater249> Flash already have overcome, you can convert to JS+html5 when youre done with project
[04:12:46] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/90mpnfh8/1/ how can i append the onclick function with parameter
[04:13:29] <shwaiil> hi
[04:13:41] <shwaiil> Q: .not() accepts array, is this an array of $(element) ? Thanks!
[04:13:43] <pater249> high
[04:15:38] <cyberbrai> any help
[04:16:13] <decx> dont user inline handlers, don't reuse ids, delegate your event
[04:16:14] <pater249> i am still in a Jquery learning process my self, have you tryd stackoverflow yet?
[04:16:56] <decx> if you append your newrow to #sort then delegate your callme handler from there
[04:17:03] <Cork> pater249: be very careful with what you find in so, very very much from there is bad
[04:18:00] <pater249> Its like google, you need to read between the lines, identify things you need.
[04:18:28] <pater249> i got allot from it, and i have posted some googies to
[04:18:28] <Cork> more like you need to know when the suggestied solution you're given is a bad solution
[04:18:53] <Cork> and sometimes just plain wrong
[04:18:56] <pater249> Yea but it is not about copy and paste in this game
[04:19:06] <pater249> its about learning
[04:19:07] <Cork> ya
[04:19:31] <pater249> There is more then one way to code, always remember that
[04:19:39] <Cork> but that's just the thing, learning from information that is wrong will just make things more confusing
[04:20:00] <cyberbrai> how can i append the onclick function with parameter injquery
[04:20:55] <pater249> Oh i think you mean those posers haha yes, i dont even read those, just click those away
[04:21:19] <Cork> it's not really posers
[04:21:36] <Cork> much of it is just ppl answering without reading up on the changes in the language
[04:21:45] <Cork> s/language/framework/
[04:23:30] <pater249> just read between the lines, if you feel it is not correct information, click away, beocuse your prob right
[04:23:49] <Cork> some of them you can't feel if they are right or not
[04:24:05] <Cork> cause the answer was right, it just isn't at the time they wrote it
[04:24:24] <pater249> Yes you will find out while working on the project
[04:24:49] <Cork> only if you test the code in the exact area where there solution breaks
[04:25:07] <Cork> and that is what makes so dangerous
[04:25:37] <pater249> Not realy just obsorb the project like a spondge
[04:25:54] <pater249> and cut the problem that u just created out
[04:26:00] <pater249> start over again
[04:26:03] <Cork> not sure how you mean that would work
[04:26:24] <Cork> if you look for a solution, you find a solution on so, that "works" but has a hidden problem that it breaks in some browsers
[04:26:41] <Cork> unless you test the code in exactly that browser, in just the situation where it breaks
[04:26:53] <Cork> how will you "detect" that the solution was bad?
[04:27:20] <Cork> the common situation is that either ppl have a broken solution, and none the wiser
[04:27:30] <Cork> or they build hack on hack on hack to try to solve the situation
[04:27:58] <DragonPunch> Cork morn

[04:52:59] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: there isn't really a selector like that
[04:53:11] <lilalinuxKL> Cork: so I have to give each td the class?
[04:53:14] <Cork> the best you can do is grabbing the th and from it the index()
[04:53:27] <Cork> then select all td with that nth-child
[04:53:40] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: it's the only one sure to be correct ya
[04:53:47] <lilalinuxKL> thank you
[04:53:58] <Cork> with the existence of colspan
[04:58:40] <shwaiil> Q: I've got an element inside <div style="position: fixed" /> and I'd like to see it's position topLeft relative to the container, but I'm getting a big number, how to get the topLeft pos relative to container when the container is fixed positioned ?
[04:59:47] <Cork> shwaiil: should work just find if you use .position()
[05:00:25] <shwaiil> Cork: thanks for your attention! yes it does work
[05:00:37] <shwaiil> just wondering why I didn't think about .position() and used offset() topLeft
[05:01:11] <Cork> .offset will give the wrong offset cause it will take the position from the parent and add the position of all its parents
[05:01:20] <Cork> so the result will be wrong
[05:01:42] <shwaiil> ok
[05:01:54] <shwaiil> so position() is relative
[05:02:39] <Cork> no position gets the offset of the element
[05:02:42] <Cork> the dom provides this
[05:03:00] <Cork> offset on the other hand tries to calculate the page absolute position
[05:03:10] <Cork> and the dom does NOT provide this info
[05:03:16] <Cork> so it has to sum up the other info
[05:03:18] <decx> it's offset() which does the adding, the native offsetTop and Left serve what you want
[05:03:22] <decx> right
[05:03:31] <Cork> and if one of the parents are fixed this value will be wrong
[05:06:56] <ManicPanic> is there a downside to doing multiple ajax requests on one page with jquery ?
[05:07:20] <Cork> not really
[05:07:26] <Cork> not more then without :)
[05:07:30] <decx> regardless of ajax and jquery it's just another request
[05:07:41] <decx> if you dont overdo it then it doesnt matter
[05:07:42] <Cork> the browser will limit the number of request done at any given time
[05:07:47] <Cork> so the load time might go up
[05:09:25] <ManicPanic> Cork: ok i got 5 max ajax requests on one page. That should be fine then
[05:09:34] <Cork> ya
[05:09:52] <ManicPanic> Cork: okay thanks
[05:10:05] <Cork> the only other thing to be careful of is the async ness of ajax calls
[05:10:16] <Cork> meaning you don't know what response will come in first
[05:12:13] <ManicPanic> Cork: its a custom server side api, that returns json encoded data. They can come in any time is not important

[06:09:55] <decx> change val() not attr
[06:19:29] <earational> hey
[06:24:59] <Guest60340> eginner question about scope please hlep me: http://pastebin.com/DJ4d4z77
[06:27:50] <decx> your function is never executed Guest60340
[06:28:06] <BillCriswell> Guest60340: Told you that last night as well but you left.
[06:28:32] <BillCriswell> It should not be undefined though.. should just be an empty array.
[06:29:22] <decx> yo bill, when doing autocomplete for search on ecommerce, do you prefer word completion or best matched products/categories?
[06:29:56] <decx> i want to push for best matched products but the client somehow wants only word completion
[06:31:07] <decx> like bo -> [bockwurst, bork, boss] instead of bo -> [Product X, 5 in Category Y]
[06:31:41] <decx> maybe wordcompletion and then productmatch
[06:31:42] <decx> hm
[06:31:45] <decx> that's it
[06:31:49] <decx> thanks bill
[06:31:52] <decx> ^^
[06:32:45] <BillCriswell> I'm sorry dude I zoned.
[06:33:13] <BillCriswell> decx: I agree with your line of thought though, because you're smart.
[06:33:35] <decx> i'll quote you on that
[06:33:39] <decx> reliable source
[06:34:17] <BillCriswell> Absolutely.
[06:34:35] <BillCriswell> I quote myself as a source for most things.
[06:37:55] <Guest60340> BillCriswell: Sorry i was having connection problems yesterday, how would it not be undefined, it doesnt have the access to that variable i thought
[06:38:21] <BillCriswell> That function has access to array, but you never call the function.
[06:38:22] <Guest60340> oh yeah an empty array
[06:38:39] <Guest60340> even if its called it will always return an empty array right?
[06:38:49] <BillCriswell> No.
[06:39:01] <BillCriswell> That function has access to that array, you just have to call it.
[06:39:14] <BillCriswell> Put function1(); before the console.log(...); line.
[06:42:20] <Guest60340> BillCriswell: Ok, thats a bad example, in general how do I get access to a locally defined variable?
[06:42:22] <decx> and you generally don't need a named function expression for debbugging anymore
[06:42:54] <BillCriswell> Guest60340: Not sure I'm following your question
[06:52:28] <notchris> How do I prevent the remaining items from showing after limiting an each function by the index? http://jsfiddle.net/chrismcgrane/y22hu6r5/
[06:56:14] <notchris> Orâ¦ http://jsfiddle.net/chrismcgrane/y22hu6r5/1/
[06:57:52] <xqo> Is it possible for event handlers to return values?
[06:58:26] <xqo> http://jsfiddle.net/cb9vob85/3/, I want my JPEG to return itself with the ArrayBuffer that FileReader reads on line 10 attached
[07:00:47] <xqo> actually, Is there some way for event handlers to return values? my fiddle fails on line 21 http://jsfiddle.net/cb9vob85/4/
[07:10:20] <decx> well your onload is still in progress when you try to dataview the bytearray property
[07:12:59] <decx> what do you mean prevent the rest from showing notchris?
[07:13:22] <notchris> decx: I figured it out, I wasnât able to limit the results, I had my order wrong
[07:19:27] <dimi1947> go at this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/b8bzq2xb/22/ line 5 at the js pane...with the line of code you see there I am trying to check all but the last checkbox(Tuesday's)
[07:19:43] <dimi1947> I cannot do it though....alll checkboxes are checked
[07:20:26] <decx> you have to filter before prop
[07:21:58] <dimi1947> why not using not()
[07:22:07] <Cork> dimi1947: .not is a filter
[07:22:16] <Cork> he meant like https://jsfiddle.net/b8bzq2xb/23/
[07:22:39] <decx> right
[07:22:42] <dimi1947> oh
[07:22:45] <Cork> you have to filter out what element shouldn't be affected
[07:22:51] <dimi1947> now I got it...
[07:22:53] <Cork> not have .not like a reverse of the last action
[07:22:53] <decx> chaining is linear
[07:23:55] <dimi1947> what do you mean by "chaining is linear"
[07:24:21] <Cork> dimi1947: each .function returns a new result of what it changed
[07:24:35] <Cork> what you put after it will work on the new set
[07:24:44] <Cork> so it works in line from left to right
[07:25:41] <BillCriswell> notchris: Use .slice
[07:25:50] <dimi1947> ok...I uderstand now...thanks
[07:26:02] <notchris> BillCriswell: Thank you, I checked it out and got it working with slice :)
[07:26:11] <BillCriswell> Cool.
[07:26:19] <Cork> notchris: or just return false in the each loop
[07:26:38] <notchris> Cork: Ah OK
[07:26:51] <Cork> so what you do there should work...
[07:27:39] <Cork> and actually it is working
[07:27:47] <Cork> it processes 0 1 2 3 and then stops
[07:27:51] <Cork> just like you ask it to
[07:35:06] <FilipNortic> if you start thinking about retriggering an ajax request in it's own callback are you doing something wrong then?
[07:36:07] <FilipNortic> or is it something commonly done?
[07:48:48] <Uhkis> retry on fail sounds like a normal case
[07:57:47] <FilipNortic> well this needs to fire again in .done
[08:02:04] <FilipNortic> should use some timeout not to get in to trouble
[08:08:31] <davidpardy> Hello, I have a post request that works if I donât use e.preventDefault() or return false. If i do use return false or preventDefault, the data does not get posted to the database (but the page does correctly NOT refresh). Why would this be? https://gist.github.com/ornerymoose/27e2054f1ca98a3fb53e
[08:13:29] <cjohnson> How can I pass "url" as a query parameter with the data option? It seems like it tries to make the request to that URL when I pass it eg $.ajax({url: 'foo', data: {url: 'http://something.com'}})
[08:13:35] <cjohnson> it makes the ajax request to http://something.com and not foo
[08:15:49] <cjohnson> davidpardy: I don't see return false or e.preventDefault in here
[08:16:01] <cjohnson> I also don't see you defining e n the function signature
[08:16:08] <davidpardy> cjohnson: yeah sorry i took them out, but i was trying them before
[08:16:17] <davidpardy> (had the e param passed in to fcn as well)
[08:16:28] <cjohnson> well we'd need to see the actual code your'e having trouble with to help with it ;)
[08:16:38] <davidpardy> lol, ok one moment :)
[08:18:18] <kingfisher64> hello jquery-ers. I'd like to replicate http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/3DRestaurantMenu/ into http://restaurant.drupalego.com/3d-restaurant-menu.
[08:18:59] <kingfisher64> Made sure the load order is jquery version then menu.js then custom-jquery.js.  The site is in drupal. I'm a jquery novice, so be gentle!
[08:19:33] <kingfisher64> firebug shows no errors, however clicking view menu doesn't work in my version.
[08:21:09] <kingfisher64> the contents of file custom-jquery.js is jQuery(document).ready(function($) {  Menu.init();  });
[08:21:17] <cjohnson> try debugging it kingfisher64
[08:21:30] <cjohnson> use your browser's step debugger, breakpoint on the menu.js line 1 and see what it does
[08:23:10] <cjohnson> I don't see any errors, and logically loading jquery, then the menu.js file, then the menu init file makes sense. so you'll have to work through it. simply copying and pasting code rarely works out
[08:23:15] <cjohnson> you're going to have to actually do some work here :P
[08:26:20] <kingfisher64> i was sent a screenshot of one issue cjohnson. Does this http://pasteboard.co/7aSvNUy.png make sense?
[08:26:44] <kingfisher64> i'd glad do the work to fix it.
[08:26:46] <cjohnson> does what make any sense?
[08:26:49] <cjohnson> I don't understand the question
[08:27:52] <kingfisher64> give me 1 min, i wrote down what was said (that corresponds to the screenshot)
[08:31:09] <kingfisher64> "notice that your $open collection is actually empty" cjohnson - does that make sense?
[08:31:18] <kingfisher64> according to the screenshot
[08:31:43] <Uhkis> kingfisher64: your problem is something covering the link
[08:32:44] <kingfisher64> if you scroll to th eright Uhkis along the same line the pointer appears to click, but nothing happens on click
[08:35:05] <kingfisher64> do you recommend a dubugger cjohnson? I've not done this before. :)
[08:41:05] <Zeranoe> Is it possible to restrict input into a textbox to numbers and letters only? No +-(() and so on would be able to be typed.
[08:42:49] <BillCriswell> Zeranoe: Sure thing, on change do this.value = this.value.replace(/[^a-z0-9]/ig/, '');
[08:45:14] <ekh> hello. I am ready a URL with non-english content. $(dom).text() gives the content with no issue, however, $(dom).html() returns html entities (ie something like &#3243;&#9237;&#8232;)
[08:45:23] <ekh> ready = reading
[08:45:34] <Zeranoe> BillCriswell: Doesn't that replace the input with nothing? So they would see it typed and then removed? Is there a way to do it by blocking the input?
[08:46:28] <rubyonrailed> Currently i'm using .keyup to send an ajax request.  It seems kinda rediculous to send on every keyup.  Whats a better method I can use?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fc1a9e9576fb54bdb3de
[08:46:34] <BillCriswell> Zeranoe: No.
[08:46:36] <BillCriswell> Zeranoe: http://jsbin.com/biluce/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:46:57] <Zeranoe> BillCriswell: Awesome, thanks!
[08:47:14] <BillCriswell> rubyonrailed: You can use .on('input', function () { }); instead...
[08:47:22] <BillCriswell> and you might want to use a debounce as well on that event.
[08:48:49] <rubyonrailed> BillCriswell: .on('input') sends the request on every character entered as well.  Is there something I can use to send the ajax request after the user is finished inputing?
[08:49:17] <BillCriswell> it's still less than keyup though, keyup does it for shifts and characters that don't cause a change in things.
[08:49:30] <BillCriswell> s/characters/keypresses/
[08:49:54] <BillCriswell> rubyonrailed: You can do it on blur if you just want to do it when the field loses focus.
[09:03:11] <NitroLiq> Hi guys, can I get a little help troubleshooting an an AJAX call to multiple APIs? I've got it mostly working but where the data from each JSONP file should be showing up within three distinct <ul> tags with bucket classes, I'm getting random results as to which <ul> the data shows up in and only the data from 2 APIs are showing up at a time.
[09:03:25] <NitroLiq> I made a testcase at jsbin: http://jsbin.com/danufahuxe/1/
[09:06:49] <NitroLiq> 	If you reload the output frame, you'll see what I mean.
[09:28:38] <cjohnson> kingfisher64: like I said, your browser comes with a debugger built in
[09:28:50] <cjohnson> put a breakpoint at the top of the file you want to inspect and then step through that code
[09:29:03] <kingfisher64> yep, i'm watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbXe2A7dILM now
[09:29:37] <cjohnson> ekh: if it's givign you HTML entities, it's because the content has HTML entities in it
[09:29:40] <cjohnson> what is your question?
[09:30:11] <amigoo89> hey guys silly questions, but what is happening here with my code? http://jsbin.com/fuceqaweyi/1/edit?js. When #1 OR #2 if == true, then the #3 if is also true, which doesn't make sense.
[09:30:48] <kingfisher64> i've loaded up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_G2kHiqU60 as well to view cjohnson
[09:32:35] <kingfisher64> i'm going to learn jquery asap, but until then I just need this fixing. "notice that your $open collection is actually empty" was a piece of advice given - not sure what to do with this piece of info though?
[09:33:55] <cjohnson> I have no clue. ask the person who gave the advice
[09:34:14] <cjohnson> I don't know what that variable being empty implies, and I have no clue why it would be empty or why it should be filled in
[09:34:50] <cjohnson> amigoo89: the three if statements have nothing to do with each other
[09:35:00] <cjohnson> why would you expect that #3 shouldn't be true just because #1 or #2 are true
[09:35:37] <cjohnson> amigoo89: '' <= 255 is true, btw
[09:36:09] <amigoo89> that's exactly the point, they don't have nothing to with eachother, but if #1 or #2 is triggered the #3 is also triggered, even though the value is okay
[09:36:25] <cjohnson> #3 being true has nothing to do with #1 or #2 being true
[09:36:46] <cjohnson> whatever is causing #3 to evaluate to true has nothing to do with the first two if statements
[09:36:55] <cjohnson> you could delete them entirely and it would still be true
[09:37:48] <amigoo89> okay look let's assume #3 value is okay (200) and the #1 value is not okay ("a"), then #3 is true (because #1) is true
[09:38:01] <cjohnson> "then #3 is true (because #1) is true" is incorrect
[09:38:05] <cjohnson> #3 is true because #3 is true
[09:38:14] <cjohnson> it has **nothing** to do with the first two if statements
[09:38:30] <amigoo89> but it isn't true! that's the point, it becomes true, when #1 or #2 is true
[09:38:36] <cjohnson> false
[09:38:37] <amigoo89> that's what I don't get
[09:38:42] <cjohnson> you're mistaken
[09:39:06] <cjohnson> #3 value is 200, which is <= 255, so it is true
[09:39:14] <cjohnson> regardless of #1 or #2
[09:39:24] <cjohnson> perhaps you mean if >= 255
[09:39:34] <cjohnson> || < 0
[09:39:57] <cjohnson> if ($("#ipaddress_tg1").val() > 255 || ("#ipaddress_tg1").val() < 0)
[09:40:03] <cjohnson> I think this is what you want
[09:40:45] <cjohnson> right now you are testing for a valid value ( <= 255) and then showing the error message if you have a valid value
[09:42:33] <amigoo89> oh yes ..
[09:42:37] <amigoo89> when I check  >= 255 it works
[09:42:43] <cjohnson> ;P
[09:42:50] <amigoo89> thanks !
[09:42:57] <amigoo89> but why the hell was did it work
[09:43:14] <amigoo89> like #1 & #2 were okay, and #3 was for example 500
[09:43:19] <amigoo89> then it gave me an error also
[09:43:43] <cjohnson> that doesn't sound accurate
[09:44:48] <cjohnson> 500 <= 255  would return false, so in your original case it wouldn't have shown an error
[09:45:39] <amigoo89> yes that's why I didn't consider, that <= was wrong
[09:45:52] <amigoo89> I don't know what was going on there but I'm editiing it
[09:45:53] <amigoo89> now
[09:45:58] <flexpaint> http://podliberty.com/drup/ i have identical autocomplete scripts and only the one in the body works. can someone help me
[09:46:05] <amigoo89> thanks again!
[09:46:34] <cjohnson> np
[09:47:15] <cjohnson> seems to work fine here flexpaint
[09:47:35] <flexpaint> cjohnson, the one inside the side menu works for you?
[09:47:53] <Sal> on the html onclick="", what can i pass? this or event?
[09:48:18] <cjohnson> don't use inline event handlers Sal
[09:48:25] <Sal> i have to
[09:48:31] <Sal> iOS sux
[09:48:33] <cjohnson> no you don't. Use .on
[09:48:38] <cjohnson> jquery method
[09:48:49] <Sal> iOS doesn't catch that
[09:48:54] <cjohnson> that's not true
[09:48:57] <Sal> only on anchors and buttons
[09:49:00] <Sal> yes
[09:49:08] <Sal> its doesn't catch it on a div
[09:49:10] <cjohnson> which element are you trying to use
[09:49:16] <Sal> <tr>
[09:49:22] <Sal> i need a click on <tr>
[09:49:33] <cjohnson> that's because it's touchevent on divs and tr
[09:49:33] <Sal> or a backfrop <div>
[09:49:49] <flexpaint> is there a side menu plugin that supports javascript within it
[09:49:49] <LAN_Lord> I have a table that is drawing a sidebar on the right via css using overflow.  On first pageload it looks okay, but after an AJAX call, the table stays the same width .... resulting in lots of whitespace.  Any suggestions on how to fight that?
[09:49:52] <cjohnson> so do $(theNode).on('click touchevent', function() { your stuff })
[09:49:53] <flexpaint> every one ive tried has this same issue
[09:50:06] <Sal> thats another damn mess
[09:50:12] <cjohnson> it is not a mess
[09:50:15] <Sal> because i then have to handle touchmove
[09:50:23] <Sal> i want to avoid all that stuff
[09:50:26] <cjohnson> try touchstart then
[09:50:30] <cjohnson> click touchstart
[09:51:03] <cjohnson> in either case, using an inline onclick isn't going to give you any different behavior than using .on('click')
[09:51:14] <cjohnson> so if it doesn't work with .on('click') it won't work with onclick=
[09:51:25] <Sal> i know, but at least iOS accepts it
[09:51:33] <cjohnson> use touchstart. problem solved
[09:51:36] <cjohnson> .on('click touchstart')
[09:52:15] <Sal> the damn thing is that i don't have an iphone or itab to test it
[09:52:40] <cjohnson> if you put it up on a public URL I can test for you real quick
[09:52:42] <cjohnson> I have iphone
[09:52:51] <cjohnson> if not, they make emulators
[09:52:54] <Sal> i will
[09:52:59] <Sal> i'm already con jsvin
[09:53:03] <Sal> jsbin
[09:53:07] <cjohnson> cool
[09:56:38] <rubyonrailed> When I run "$('.eligibility input')" will that grab all inputs or just inputs with the class .eligibility?
[09:59:43] <shoky> rubyonrailed: all inputs that are descendants of elements with eligibility class
[10:01:36] <Sal> cjohnson, http://output.jsbin.com/moqabe
[10:02:43] <cjohnson> works great sal
[10:02:48] <cjohnson> I get hit silver
[10:02:54] <cjohnson> nothing when I tap the yellow one
[10:03:00] <Sal> and no yellow?
[10:03:06] <Sal> great
[10:03:14] <Sal> on iPad should be the same
[10:03:16] <Sal> i hope
[10:03:22] <kingfisher64> put "debugger" before code and it stops on line 13 initEvents(); of menu.js does this mean that this is the culprit cjohnson?
[10:03:30] <cjohnson> rubyonrailed: neither. it will find only <input> inside any element whose class is eligibility
[10:03:44] <cjohnson> kingfisher64: it stops because it's waiting for you to continue the code
[10:03:52] <cjohnson> google "how to use js debugger" or similar to see how to use it
[10:05:08] <cjohnson> rubyonrailed: note that it won't find <select> or <textarea>
[10:05:11] <cjohnson> not sure if you were aware
[10:05:15] <cjohnson> you can use :input to find all 3
[10:08:15] <adv_> https://jsfiddle.net/4qrLogbt/4/ this code works on the fiddle but not on my app, i suspect that it's not specific enough and it matches other stuff in the html
[10:08:51] <adv_> how can i make it more specific? i think first line is the problem
[10:12:15] <negusnegesti> hi
[10:12:24] <negusnegesti> kennt sich einer von euch mit js ext aus?
[10:16:51] <negusnegesti> ich mÃ¶chte einen geÃ¶ffneten tab im framework schlieÃen
[10:17:36] <deldotbat> any1 have a good modal plugin they like?
[10:18:12] <cjohnson> adv_: give it explicit classes instead of just finding all elements with btn- in them. Also dont' use .slice(1) to get the elements you want -- use classes to filter them out
[10:18:25] <tasaif> negusnegesti: Ich habe einen Ãbersetzer, also bitte entschuldigen Sie meine Grammatik. Vielleicht sind Sie fÃ¼r die jQuery-dev-Kanal suchen.
[10:18:29] <cjohnson> put a console.log at the top of your click event to see if the issue is your first line, or if it's the handler body
[10:18:47] <cjohnson> deldotbat: google for one, there are a million
[10:25:50] <adv_> cjohnson: can you update the fiddle?
[10:27:44] <deldotbat> does anyone know a place to find a decent layout/2d artist, like a subreddit or board?
[10:31:03] <Sal> is this the correct way to be able to call a click handling functions even directly?
[10:31:04] <Sal> http://i.imgur.com/FCDnQxA.png
[10:31:54] <tasaif> ...
[10:32:17] <tasaif> what?
[10:32:27] <Sal> never mind sorry
[10:32:34] <Sal> i'm rethinking it
[10:35:48] <tasaif> Sal: maybe this will help? http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/do06x4bm/
[10:39:07] <negusnegesti1> oh, sorry, forgot this is an english speaking channel...
[10:39:07] <negusnegesti1> Is there anybody with experience with the js ext framework?
[10:39:07] <negusnegesti1> Probably very easy, how can I close an open tab?
[10:39:07] <negusnegesti1> I add it with: Ext.getCmp('CenterPanel').add(progForm4);
[10:39:07] <negusnegesti1> But how can I remove it?
[10:39:16] <rubyonrailed> cjohnson: THanks i ended up using :input
[11:03:10] <jwmann> I have this setup where the user types letters into a text fields and I use jQuery to update a render area. The issue I need to fix is resizing the font-size to accomdate and fit text that would normally go outside the render box. How would I accomplish this? - http://jsfiddle.net/v6do0ex6/
[11:04:07] <jwmann> I tried using FlowType.JS but I think this library solves a similar but different issue.
[11:15:18] <Lencl> for selector  $('ul', "body")
[11:15:27] <Lencl> does that mean the ul after <body>
[11:15:47] <jwmann> That means 'ul' must be a child of 'body'
[11:16:11] <jwmann> e.g.: <body><ul></ul></body>
[11:16:45] <jwmann> You could also do $('body ul');
[11:18:38] <tuskkk___> How do I send a POST to one of those controller actions (php yii) and get the html response to append to the dom?
[11:19:24] <Lencl> ah I see
[11:19:34] <Lencl> but I think that's how you also selector multiple elements
[11:19:51] <Lencl> like $('.element1",".element2")
[11:19:57] <midwestward> in the widget framework, what is the best way to store state?
[11:20:29] <Lencl> tuskkk___, ajax post
[11:21:09] <tuskkk___> Lencl: any link with an example please
[11:21:32] <midwestward> just on the element?
[11:21:53] <Lencl> tuskkk___, there's plenty of examples online. Here's one in the jquery website: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[11:22:01] <Lencl> Look at the very bottom, that's what you're looking for
[11:22:36] <Lencl> For Yii, just have the url set to 'nameOfYourController/theNameOfyouraction'
[11:22:43] <Lencl> and make sure that action is accessible
[11:23:56] <Lencl> tuskkk___, here's another example: http://www.sitepoint.com/use-jquerys-ajax-function/
[11:24:40] <Lencl> it includes the success function and the "data" parameter can be used to retrieve from the $_POST thus being able to append it to your dom
[11:25:47] <tuskkk___> Lencl: and in data we send the value that will be the argument to that function, or will we have to get that value in that action?
[11:27:52] <Lencl> tuskkk___ you send the data through ajax
[11:29:18] <Lencl> The one before the colon is what the $_POST will be called
[11:29:47] <Lencl> so data{id : ...} the post will be $_POST['id'];
[11:29:59] <tuskkk___> Lencl: I meant the 'data' field, can we do something like this? data: { argumentToTheMethod : value },
[11:31:54] <Lencl> tuskkk___ I don't believe you can do that.. however I know that Yii takes the $_GET[] parameters
[11:32:04] <Lencl> so you can just have it on your url
[11:32:23] <tuskkk___> oh ok, thanks a lot Lencl
[11:32:57] <tuskkk___> one more thing though, what does event.preventDefault(); do?
[11:34:21] <Lencl> it stops the default action of element from happening
[11:34:55] <tuskkk___> default action like what?
[11:35:11] <Lencl> here's an example: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/
[11:35:25] <Lencl> So you can stop <a href> from actually going to the link
[11:36:03] <tuskkk___> oh ok, thanks :)
[11:36:41] <User900> Hi. Anybody can say me why this little and simple script using jQuery is not working? http://pastebin.com/a0EiAEMT
[11:37:01] <User900> i think the problem is when i set the new attribute but i can't understand where is the problem
[11:37:58] <NoiseEee> !php
[11:37:58] <User900> line 19
[11:38:00] <Lencl> you're missing a semicolon after button = document.getElementById('btnVote<?php echo $id_news;?>')
[11:38:14] <NoiseEee> paste the rendered output, not php User900
[11:39:11] <NoiseEee> and uh, you have a dynamically named function???!
[11:39:18] <NoiseEee> how does that work
[11:39:27] <NoiseEee> s/work/help anything at all/
[11:39:47] <User900> i have a button to vote, then when i click the button it have to change the number to +1 without reload the page
[11:40:05] <NoiseEee> User900: wonderful, but makes zero sense about having a dynamically named function
[11:40:26] <User900> Lencl, i added the semiclons and it stills doing the same
[11:40:37] <NoiseEee> your first step is to look at the RENDERED OUTPUT
[11:40:41] <NoiseEee> only then can you debug
[11:40:51] <NoiseEee> then after that we can talk about making a single function.
[11:40:55] <User900> NoiseEee, this is because i have more than one button to vote and they are using the same script
[11:41:04] <NoiseEee> then you pass the button in to the single function.
[11:41:11] <NoiseEee> s/the button/each button
[11:42:00] <User900> i dont know what means rendered output
[11:42:03] <brettfrable> hey
[11:42:23] <brettfrable> i need to detect if and when a div is 50px from the bottom of the window, is this possible?
[11:42:52] <User900> NoiseEee, when i click the button it says "voting..." al the time and not return the result
[11:42:53] <robmal_> Yes. .position and some math.
[11:43:55] <User900> NoiseEee, if i change  button.setAttribute('value',votes+1); to  button.setAttribute('value','you voted'); then it runs
[11:44:04] <User900> the problem is when i try to use the var
[11:44:11] <User900> to set the value of the attribute
[11:44:29] <NoiseEee> User900: "rendered output" means what the browser ultimately sees, after the PHP has been processed
[11:44:50] <User900> okey, then it is what i explained, the button is alwais saying "voting..."
[11:44:53] <User900> and not change
[11:45:09] <User900> and if i do this change then it runs, but i need add 1 to the variable
[11:45:26] <User900> can you understand me?
[11:45:32] <NoiseEee> User900: you're solving the wrong problem
[11:45:43] <NoiseEee> you think thats the problem, but you actually have no idea WHERE the problem is occuring
[11:45:44] <User900> my english is basic
[11:45:56] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ User900
[11:46:08] <brettfrable> noiseeee
[11:46:12] <NoiseEee> fair enough User900 but you cannot fix your problem without starting with what the BROWSER sees
[11:46:16] <brettfrable> can you show me
[11:48:04] <User900> okey thx
[11:50:26] <tasaif> User900: what language do you speak
[11:50:49] <User900> spanish
[12:01:34] <brettfrable> anyone?
[12:01:41] <brettfrable> cant seem to find anything in stackoverflow
[12:02:11] <User900> finally i did it
[12:02:21] <User900> NoiseEee, it doesn't was a syntax error
[12:02:51] <NoiseEee> ok User900
[12:03:18] <NoiseEee> brettfrable: start by specifying when you are going to check that div
[12:03:21] <User900> is better firebug than the default debugger of firefox?
[12:03:40] <NoiseEee> User900: meh hard to say
[12:04:09] <brettfrable> when it is 100px from the bottom of the window
[12:04:28] <NoiseEee> brettfrable: how is it getting there?
[12:04:37] <NoiseEee> ie: you need to hook into an event to begin your check
[12:04:39] <brettfrable> scrolling
[12:04:57] <brettfrable> so if a user is scrolling down
[12:05:19] <User900> i love me when something runs
[12:05:36] <NoiseEee> User900: don't be too proud, your "dynamic functions" are insane
[12:05:50] <User900> xD but if not then it can't run
[12:05:51] <NoiseEee> User900: look into creating a single function that accepts a button as a parameter
[12:06:37] <User900> okey maybe it sounds good
[12:07:09] <User900> i did it because if not then all buttons execute the last button or something similar
[12:07:41] <User900> you are good NoiseEee you are good
[12:07:53] <User900> is a better idea
[12:10:05] <vin-ivar> a question on .attr()
[12:10:16] <vin-ivar> src lets you set the source URL, right?
[12:10:22] <vin-ivar> so if you just have the raw text
[12:10:27] <vin-ivar> and you want that to be the source
[12:10:29] <vin-ivar> for the element
[12:10:31] <vin-ivar> what do you do?
[12:11:18] <Uhkis> ehm, what?
[12:11:20] <NoiseEee> vin-ivar: whats the element / text ?
[12:11:54] <vin-ivar> okay, i didn't explain it very well
[12:12:01] <vin-ivar> suppose I have an element
[12:12:04] <vin-ivar> #outpic
[12:12:15] <NoiseEee> thats not an element
[12:12:21] <Uhkis> that's an id, not an element
[12:12:29] <NoiseEee> are you talking about an <img> element?
[12:12:44] <vin-ivar> right, an img element with id #outpic, I meant
[12:12:47] <vin-ivar> sorry
[12:13:17] <vin-ivar> apologies - it's an iframe, not an img
[12:13:30] <vin-ivar> I could run $("#outputpic").attr("src", "http://my.url")
[12:13:50] <vin-ivar> now, if i have the *content* of my.url - the html representation of the website at that URL
[12:13:59] <vin-ivar> and I want to set my iframe to display it
[12:14:05] <vin-ivar> what's the best way to do that?
[12:14:14] <vin-ivar> let's assume I don't have the URL, but a lot of HTML
[12:14:36] <Uhkis> how about we stop assuming and you tell what's actually going on
[12:15:25] <NoiseEee> vin-ivar: you'd have to go into the iframes document, and set the content there really
[12:15:44] <NoiseEee> but its all uh strange
[12:15:58] <vin-ivar> Uhkis, I scraped the code at the URL I wanted to display, and used regex to modify some of it. now I want to display my modified code in the iframe
[12:16:02] <Uhkis> if you have a lot of html, you can just $('#element').html(yourhtml);
[12:16:29] <Uhkis> and you don't need an iframe for that
[12:16:31] <vin-ivar> doesn't .html() return the html?
[12:16:32] <NoiseEee> why use an iframe at all
[12:16:50] <Uhkis> vin-ivar: html() _sets_ or gets html of an element
[12:16:53] <NoiseEee> vin-ivar: html() vs html(someValue)
[12:17:52] <Uhkis> ?api html @ vin-ivar
[12:17:52] <b-ot> vin-ivar: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:18:24] <vin-ivar> hm, doesn't work, I'm afraid
[12:18:45] <Uhkis> ?demo @ vin-ivar
[12:18:45] <b-ot> vin-ivar: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:49:06] <lilalinuxKL> Is there built-in template functionality in jquery or does it need a plugin?
[12:52:44] <robertmaxrees> nothing built-in.
[12:54:00] <robertmaxrees> lilalinux do you have underscore included in your project?
[12:55:06] <lilalinuxKL> I'm using the shipped jquery in JIRA
[12:55:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, jquery doesn't have anything baked in.
[12:55:38] <lilalinuxKL> :-/
[12:55:53] <robertmaxrees> i was asking about underscore because it has a templating system.
[12:56:19] <lilalinuxKL> I'm afraid it's just plain jquery
[12:56:37] <robertmaxrees> lol underscore is a separate lib, not even a plugin
[12:56:38] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[12:59:06] <lilalinuxKL> oh apparently there is some templating functionality: https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/docs/template.html
[12:59:19] <robertmaxrees> within JIRA, yeah.
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> thought you needed something specifically for jq.
[12:59:59] <lilalinuxKL> whatever comes first :-)
[13:02:42] <brettfrable> lol
[13:48:51] <choosegoose> is there a drag and drop DOM grid framework that is currently being maintained
[13:49:27] <robertmaxrees> huh
[13:49:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:49:38] <robertmaxrees> there are drag and drop libs and frameworks out there.
[13:49:52] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the "DOM grid" piece has to do with it.
[13:50:09] <choosegoose> e.g. gridster, which is no longer maintained
[13:51:48] <robertmaxrees> jrm
[13:51:54] <robertmaxrees> looks kind of like isotope.
[13:52:13] <robertmaxrees> you could give it a shot - only been dead since september.
[13:53:12] <hd1> $.get(url) returns a string,what does jquery expect it to return?
[13:53:27] <robertmaxrees> hd1 huh?
[13:54:28] <hd1> robertmaxrees: "Cherry Blossom Dream | Flickr - Photo Sharing!" is giving me a syntax error
[13:55:01] <hd1> i'd just like to have this text be the innerText of a div
[13:55:08] <hd1> instead of the URL
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> what's your actual code?
[13:55:25] <robertmaxrees> becuase $.get(url) shouldn't throw an error.
[13:56:03] <hd1> robertmaxrees: it doesn't throw an error
[13:56:34] <robertmaxrees> okay... then what is?
[13:56:42] <hd1> http://hasan.d8u.us/links.js is the javascript
[13:57:18] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:58:10] <robertmaxrees> okay, what line throws the error?
[13:58:16] <robertmaxrees> you're giving me nothing to work with.
[13:58:35] <hd1> the backend code that's called is at http://pastebin.com/z8RemzsU
[13:58:45] <robertmaxrees> i don't care about the backend fwiw.
[13:58:55] <robertmaxrees> can you show me an actual page that's throwing the error?
[13:59:07] <hd1> links.d8u.us
[13:59:17] <hd1> is the page throwing the error
[14:01:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess that this is a context issue.
[14:01:51] <hd1> you're giving me nothing to work with -- what would be something that you could work with?
[14:02:01] <robertmaxrees> the page was perfect.
[14:02:11] <hd1> it's an hd1-doesnt-know-jquery-issue
[14:02:19] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:02:28] <robertmaxrees> it's more of a javascript problem.
[14:02:45] * hd1 doesn't know javascript either
[14:02:57] <hd1> why does it throw an error on a raw string?
[14:03:06] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[14:03:07] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:03:33] <hd1> it's not supposed to interpret it, it's just supposed to put it into the div instead of the URL on hover
[14:03:44] <robertmaxrees> right, I don't know if that's really your issue.
[14:03:44] <hd1> no processing desired
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> one secont.
[14:03:49] <robertmaxrees> second.
[14:03:53] <hd1> sure
[14:10:09] <robertmaxrees> is it possible for you to wrap the response in quotes?
[14:10:39] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't adding up.
[14:15:54] <hd1> on the backend?
[14:16:31] <robertmaxrees> something about the ajax response is busted.  http://fixee.org/paste/cihhevz/
[14:16:42] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you replace what you currently have with this?
[14:21:34] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[14:22:43] <robertmaxrees> what should the request URL look like?
[14:23:11] <hd1> robert: /title?page=<url>
[14:23:42] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:24:28] <\matt\> is there any way to use $.proxy yet somehow have access to the original context as well as the "overridden" one?
[14:24:59] <hd1> web cache?
[14:25:12] <robertmaxrees> hd1 he's talking about function context.
[14:25:29] <robertmaxrees> hd1 your issue has to do with your server response.
[14:26:12] * hd1 sees BSE is alive and well
[14:26:15] * hd1 sighs
[14:26:35] <robertmaxrees> "BSE"?
[14:26:39] <hd1> robert: what does Javascript expect to get back
[14:26:45] <robertmaxrees> a string.
[14:26:52] <hd1> and it's getting a string back
[14:26:56] <robertmaxrees> which you're not feeding it.  wrap the response in quotes and see if that fixes it.
[14:26:57] <hd1> so, it's not the server
[14:27:06] <robertmaxrees> just try duder.
[14:27:13] <robertmaxrees> it's trying to parse the response as if it's markup.
[14:28:53] <hd1> i figured
[14:30:26] <robertmaxrees> alsO: "BSE"?
[14:30:51] <hd1> Blame Someone Else
[14:30:58] <robertmaxrees> that's... not wht i'm doing
[14:31:13] <hd1> that's what you did above
[14:31:20] <robertmaxrees> where?
[14:31:22] <hd1> "your server response"
[14:31:24] <Blabla12345> hi folks
[14:31:31] <robertmaxrees> hd1 that's not me blaming anything.
[14:31:41] <robertmaxrees> that's me tossing out a guess to fix your issue.
[14:31:43] <hd1> when JS should be able to handle straight text
[14:32:43] <hd1> it expects the page parameter, which you aren't giving it in your ajax call, robert
[14:33:03] <robertmaxrees> i corrected that here: http://fixee.org/paste/qv4yt4e/
[14:34:42] <hd1> i see.
[14:35:03] <hd1> now it needs to replace the url with the text obtained from /title?page=<url?
[14:35:14] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[14:35:19] <robertmaxrees> you'll see you're still getting errors.
[14:36:10] <hd1> I'm not getting errors
[14:36:17] <robertmaxrees> i am.
[14:36:17] <hd1> I'm getting the text I should be
[14:36:20] <hd1> what errors?
[14:36:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting a syntax error in my console.
[14:36:41] * hd1 isn't getting a syntax error
[14:36:44] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[14:36:46] <hd1> maybe try reloading the page?
[14:37:07] <robertmaxrees> still getting a syntax error.
[14:37:19] <hd1> what line number in the js?
[14:37:46] <robertmaxrees> if I copy/paste the code I just gave you into the console, I get a syntax error.
[14:37:53] <DragonPunch> \o
[14:39:44] <robertmaxrees> looks like my theory about quotes was incorrect.
[14:40:16] <hd1> it works now
[14:40:22] <hd1> thank you, robertmaxrees
[14:40:45] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:40:47] <robertmaxrees> oookay
[14:41:23] <hd1> what browser?
[14:41:27] <robertmaxrees> firefox
[14:41:52] <hd1> I'm also on Firefox
[14:41:56] <hd1> and things work fine
[14:42:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting a lot of nothing.  weird.
[14:43:01] <hd1> are you on Windows?
[14:43:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:43:09] <robertmaxrees> chrome seems to work fine.
[14:43:11] <hd1> I'm on Mac
[14:43:12] <robertmaxrees> ff doesn't.
[14:43:14] <robertmaxrees> strange.
[14:43:22] <hd1> but I don't see why this should be a problem
[14:43:27] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't be.
[14:43:36] <tasaif> what's up?
[14:43:38] <robertmaxrees> and i doubt it is.  it could be a quirk with my setup.
[14:44:18] <robertmaxrees> homeslice has an ajax call that works fine for him on FF, but errors out for me in FF.
[14:44:21] <robertmaxrees> chrome's solid, though.
[14:44:26] <robertmaxrees> wondering what's up.
[14:44:32] <tasaif> link me?
[14:44:44] <hd1> links.d8u.us,  tasaif
[14:44:48] <robertmaxrees> i'm probably the odd man out in this case.
[14:44:55] <hd1> i'm asking my gf to check from her work
[14:45:06] <hd1> i think she's forced to use IE
[14:45:21] <tasaif> I'm just getting a 404 for the favicon
[14:45:31] <tasaif> I don't need to interact with it or anything right?
[14:45:39] <robertmaxrees> IE11 works fine here.
[14:45:41] <hd1> that's fine
[14:45:43] <robertmaxrees> mouse over links.
[14:45:49] <hd1> there's no favicon -- yet
[14:46:03] <tasaif> internal server error
[14:46:05] <tasaif> 500
[14:46:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting the error on FF on my work machine, too.
[14:46:13] <robertmaxrees> syntax error.
[14:47:10] <robertmaxrees> text updates, but I still get the error message.  wonder why.
[14:47:23] <tasaif> syntax error in ff
[14:47:33] <hd1> cause i is black, innit? :)
[14:47:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:47:55] <hd1> it's an ali-g reference, robert
[14:48:13] <robertmaxrees> wasn't really all that funny in context, but OK.
[14:48:16] <hd1> when you can't explain something logically, one always plays the race card
[14:48:23] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[14:48:24] <tasaif> let's keep it pc?
[14:48:29] <robertmaxrees> not here,.
[14:48:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, sorry man - not the right place for that.
[14:48:47] <hd1> sure
[14:48:52] <hd1> no worries, my apologies
[14:48:53] <tasaif> title:1:1
[14:49:00] <tasaif> syntax error
[14:49:07] <robertmaxrees> ^ yep, that's what I'm seeing, as well.
[14:49:10] <hd1> tasaif: that's a string, try clicking it
[14:49:29] <tasaif> I get another one: not well-formed title:1:1
[14:49:42] <robertmaxrees> encoding problems maybe?
[14:49:54] <bepolite> ?calc 1+1
[14:49:55] <b-ot> bepolite: Error convertingâ¦
[14:50:08] <hd1> where's the netfilter toolbar option?
[14:50:16] <hd1> in firebug, am not seeing any toolbar
[14:50:25] <robertmaxrees> not in firebug.
[14:50:33] <robertmaxrees> default dev tools.
[14:51:32] <tasaif> hd1: did you set the type of response you're expecting in your ajax call?
[14:52:11] <krambiorix> anyone who uses dropzonejs?
[14:52:30] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix lots of people do i'd guess.
[14:53:36] <hd1> tasaif: doesn't look like it
[14:53:53] <tasaif> hopefully that solves it
[14:54:04] <hd1> is that dataType: string,
[14:54:10] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:54:16] <tasaif> that's a thing?
[14:54:20] <robertmaxrees> setting that doesn't seem to make a difference from my testing.
[14:54:28] <robertmaxrees> at least in this case.
[14:54:41] <tasaif> i've only ever played with dataType: xml or json
[14:54:45] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, i try to make all my table rows dropzone-able ... But when clicking the clickable element, the browsers browse popup opens multiple times...   http://pastebin.com/hhXA2f3T
[14:54:51] <robertmaxrees> there's a text one and a few others.
[14:54:56] <fred1807> is there a way to include a variable, from html, to be included on $.post  , and reach the php?  (example, load.php?name=myvariablefromthehtml
[14:55:07] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 ... sure?
[14:55:14] <robertmaxrees> just grab the value and pop it into the post call.
[14:55:50] <tasaif> fred1807: (easy mode is to put it into a hidden input field)
[14:56:13] <robertmaxrees> that's another way to do it.
[14:56:19] <hd1> tasaif: it actually broke my session, by adding the dataType:'string' line in the ajax call
[14:56:24] <robertmaxrees> but it looks like you want it in the URL, not the post body.
[14:56:51] <robertmaxrees> hd1 it's 'text', not string, iirc.
[14:56:52] <Crucials> that works with input fields too
[14:56:53] <robertmaxrees> ?api ajax
[14:56:53] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: No matches.
[14:57:06] <robertmaxrees> input fields don't go into the url for posts.
[14:57:31] <fred1807> my "button" is the whole div. I call the funtion like this  <a id=myfunction   And I have to Hardcode the variable here. I need this to avoid hardcoding a whole jquery function for every div
[14:57:47] <robertmaxrees> don't call it from your html.
[14:57:58] <tasaif> http://wat.jpg.to
[14:58:15] <robertmaxrees> i can see what you're trying to do.
[14:58:16] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:58:22] <hd1> robert: /title?page=foo&dataType=text, then?
[14:58:33] <robertmaxrees> hd1 datatype is an option for ajax.
[14:58:37] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs.
[14:58:42] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, any idea how to solve it?
[14:58:59] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix i dunno - try making a functioning fiddle and asking the entire channel instead :)
[14:59:07] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 what's the value you're grabbing from the anchor?
[14:59:16] <hd1> xml, json, script, or html <=== dataType values on http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[14:59:29] <robertmaxrees> hd1 right - those are apart of the confid.
[14:59:30] <robertmaxrees> not the url.
[15:00:11] <hd1> you said "looks like you want it in the URL"
[15:00:17] <hd1> was that to someone else?
[15:00:17] <robertmaxrees> i was talking to fred1807
[15:00:40] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/bvf6csv/ is how you use datatype.
[15:01:25] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/camfhhnL/
[15:01:28] <robertmaxrees> p[retty simple concept.
[15:02:12] <Lencl> hello
[15:02:28] <Lencl> What's the best way to get the value from a url parameter?
[15:02:34] <fred1807> robertmaxrees:  The variable is hardoceded on the url, every div block has a name, and this is what I want to get to the php?variable=   . I dont need to automagically get the div name be reding anywhere else, I just need how to propoer hardcode it, into the <a id=function myvariable_where?> div bla bla </a>    So the $.post load.php?var=LookMyVariableIsHere
[15:02:37] <Lencl> should I put it in input and then call it?
[15:02:45] <robertmaxrees> Lencl wut
[15:02:52] <hd1> got it, robert
[15:02:56] <Lencl> like website.com?param1=value
[15:03:00] <robertmaxrees> Lencl http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[15:03:00] <hd1> i think (?)
[15:03:01] <robertmaxrees> try this.
[15:03:21] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 don't call functions in your html like that.
[15:03:32] <Lencl> ah nice
[15:03:51] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 that's a bad idea.  look at my fiddle.
[15:03:52] <fas3r> hello
[15:04:20] <robertmaxrees> also, post usually sends variables in the post body, not in the URL like that, fred1807
[15:04:34] <fas3r> is it possible to know if a form was submitted via a "click" or a "trigger" ?
[15:05:10] <robertmaxrees> fas3r sort of, yeah.
[15:05:39] <robertmaxrees> though it shouldn't matter most of the time :)
[15:05:45] <fas3r> :D
[15:05:46] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, well, i tried to setup a fiddle but couldn't make it work .... : https://jsfiddle.net/y5tx5cjg/1/
[15:06:02] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: well it's that or I recreate my function submit so :D
[15:06:03] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix because your selector is bad.
[15:06:18] <fred1807> robertmaxrees:  It maybe wrong, but, is it possible to include a variable like that?
[15:06:30] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 like what?
[15:07:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y5tx5cjg/3/ krambiorix
[15:07:15] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, i fixed that... Please click on 'CLICK' and see what happens
[15:07:21] <fred1807> <a id=jquery_function var=this_is_a_variable_jquery_will_include_on_$.post_to_php> bla bla </a>
[15:07:35] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix why do you keep talking directly to me when there are lots of other people on the channel.
[15:07:39] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 that's not valid html/.
[15:07:40] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: this : https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/check-if-event-was-triggered-or-native/ ?
[15:07:53] <robertmaxrees> use a data-attribute instead of "var"
[15:08:05] <robertmaxrees> data-somevalue="the_thing_you_want"
[15:08:07] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, cause you're the only one that is not asking questions but answering :)
[15:08:09] <robertmaxrees> fas3r that's one way.
[15:08:19] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: just I put the event wastrigerred in the submit function event ?
[15:08:24] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix that doens't mean i have all the answers ;)
[15:08:41] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, nope, but where there is smoke...
[15:08:53] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: something more practical :) ?
[15:08:57] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/u4Lh5g03/
[15:09:09] <robertmaxrees> rewrite your code not to worry about the difference, fas3r
[15:09:18] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[15:09:20] <fas3r> mouahha
[15:09:20] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[15:09:32] <tasaif> me?
[15:09:34] <robertmaxrees> tasaif you just re-wrore onclick.
[15:09:43] <fred1807> Ok, I half understanding this fiddle of yours. http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/camfhhnL/   . How could I make Foo call a function that $.post=load.php?name=foo    and bar would result in, $.post=load.php?name=bar  baz, $.post=load.php?name=baz....
[15:09:48] <fred1807> robertmaxrees:
[15:09:53] <krambiorix> ok, my question to all: click on 'CLICK' and see what happens... What can i do about that behaviour? https://jsfiddle.net/y5tx5cjg/2/
[15:10:00] <tasaif> did I?
[15:10:05] <robertmaxrees> basically, yeah.
[15:10:30] <tasaif> but I wanna put my logic in my view
[15:10:36] <tasaif> chocolate in the peanut butter
[15:10:43] <fred1807> robertmaxrees: Because I am about to hardcode a function for every "button" on my page Lol :P
[15:10:47] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:11:09] <tasaif> fred1807: are you saying you're going to rewrite the function for each button?
[15:11:15] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[15:11:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm making the example right now.
[15:11:22] <robertmaxrees> just chill.
[15:11:54] <tasaif> use my fiddle, it's terrible
[15:11:57] <tasaif> terribly amazing
[15:12:17] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/camfhhnL/1/
[15:12:52] <tasaif> oh, the function is serverside?
[15:13:01] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix http://www.dropzonejs.com/#config-clickable
[15:13:04] <robertmaxrees> this is your problem.
[15:13:15] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm one sec.
[15:13:28] <robertmaxrees> ignore me.
[15:13:46] <fred1807> robertmaxrees: Nice,  this will be global for every <a  ? Wont mess with other <a links ?
[15:13:46] <krambiorix> :)
[15:14:02] <tasaif> fred1807: put a class on each one you want to effect
[15:14:06] <tasaif> or rather
[15:14:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:14:14] <robertmaxrees> put a class on the ones youw ant.
[15:14:17] <tasaif> check for the data-function attr's existence
[15:14:19] <robertmaxrees> and target that instead.
[15:14:47] <tasaif> if ($(this).data('function') is not undefined, run your code
[15:15:03] <robertmaxrees> or just do if ($(this).data('function')) {}
[15:15:08] <robertmaxrees> since undefined is falsy.
[15:15:18] <tasaif> yea
[15:15:18] <robertmaxrees> no need to do more.
[15:15:53] <Crucials> but it would probably be better practice to add a class and target that instead of adding a listener to a bunch of elements you dont want to
[15:16:14] <robertmaxrees> it'd be smartest to use a delegated listener instead.
[15:16:24] <robertmaxrees> and use a class to "filter" on.
[15:16:53] <tasaif> fixed it
[15:16:53] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/camfhhnL/3/
[15:17:17] <robertmaxrees> 'sup variable declaration problems.

[15:17:58] <robertmaxrees> that function is totally unnecessary

[15:22:29] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, what did you change?!
[15:22:41] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix look at the SO post i just shared your way.

[15:42:18] <felipedvorak> robertmaxrees: its not working T_T http://fixee.org/paste/fahnf1b/
[15:43:21] <robertmaxrees> err. $overlay.isShowing() isn't literal.
[15:43:36] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to determine a way do see if it's showing or hidden.
[15:43:41] <robertmaxrees> *to see
[15:46:53] <tasaif> did you know that there's a DOMSubtreeModified event?
[15:46:58] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:47:01] <felipedvorak> robertmaxrees: robertmaxrees thx
[15:47:33] <robertmaxrees> tasaif did you know it's fragile?
[15:47:47] <tasaif> I'm googling compatibility now
[15:47:56] <robertmaxrees> not like that.
[15:48:04] <tasaif> how so?
[15:48:05] <robertmaxrees> people get into infinite loops with it all the time.
[15:48:14] <robertmaxrees> it's also kind of a funky implicit concept imo.
[15:49:07] <tasaif> well you can't blame the computer for while(true);
[15:49:10] <robertmaxrees> also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6659662/why-is-the-domsubtreemodified-event-deprecated-in-dom-level-3
[15:50:16] <robertmaxrees> if you really want to watch the document for changes (and you generally don't), you want https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[15:51:07] <tasaif> compatibility is good if you don't care about IE
[15:51:27] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change that it's deprecated.
[15:51:38] <robertmaxrees> and that watching the document for changes is generally not what you actually want ;)
[15:51:46] <tasaif> wait.. MutationObserver is deprecated?
[15:51:58] <robertmaxrees> no.  domsubtreemodified is.
[15:52:12] <tasaif> ohâ¦ yea, the compatibility was about that
[15:52:18] <tasaif> the observer

[16:11:01] <mutedog> anyone familiar with the jquery validation plugin? Iâm running into a weird issue
[16:11:08] <robertmaxrees> lots of people are :)
[16:11:11] <robertmaxrees> what's your problem.
[16:11:48] <mutedog> I have a phonefield thatâs required and also should be validating against phoneUS
[16:12:09] <mutedog> if you type any numbers in the field and hit enter, the form submits, even if other required fields are empty
[16:12:24] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[16:12:46] <mutedog> nope
[16:12:54] <robertmaxrees> have a sample we can look at?
[16:13:08] <robertmaxrees> like in a fiddle or something?
[16:13:21] <mutedog> http://prejeancreative.com/bridgestar-logistics/interior/ the form is down at the bottom
[16:13:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting a console error :)
[16:14:17] <robertmaxrees> open your console and type into the phone number field.
[16:15:03] <mutedog> hmm, okay, what does that mean?
[16:15:52] <robertmaxrees> phoneus isn't included by default iirc.
[16:16:08] <mutedog> wat?
[16:16:37] <mutedog> itâd be nice if the documentation mentioned that
[16:16:42] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/1.13.1/dist/additional-methods.js#L654-L658
[16:16:50] <robertmaxrees> iirc it does, but not where you'd normally look.
[16:17:11] <mutedog> hmm, okay how do i add it?
[16:17:50] <robertmaxrees> download and include the entire additional-methods.js file, or include just that block there in your page before you call jquery validate.
[16:17:58] <robertmaxrees> *initialize jquery validate, i mean.
[16:19:18] <Collin_> I'm having a major problem in IE8. I have an <input type="hidden" id="foobar" name="foobar" />, but $("foobar") returns nothing
[16:19:32] <Collin_> However, $("input[type=hidden]")[0].id returns "foobar"
[16:19:34] <robertmaxrees> because $('foobar') isn't a valid selector.
[16:19:41] <robertmaxrees> $('#foobar') is.
[16:19:48] <Collin_> Derp, thank you
[16:19:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:20:03] <mutedog> sweet, that has fixed it, thanks you, robertmaxrees
[16:20:11] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[16:20:14] <mutedog> I truly appreciate your help
[16:20:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah - i've been bitten by that one a few times myself.
[16:24:51] <robertmaxrees> Collin_ i see your discussion over in ##javascript - you're relying on an implicit getElementByID() call.
[16:25:43] <Collin_> I'm trying to understand why it succeeds with short names, but not long names
[16:26:01] <robertmaxrees> tbh you shouldn't rely on it at all.
[16:26:53] <robertmaxrees> http://wtfjs.com/2013/10/02/implicit-getElementById lots of funk with them in the first place.
[16:31:54] <pauled> good evening robertmaxrees :)
[16:32:06] <pauled> glad to see you here :)
[16:33:11] <pauled> Today I will not bore you with my beginner cares :)
[16:36:58] <pauled> My todo list is pretty important 1. handle with internationalised menu entry :) 2. Insert a dialogue box for userscript settings.
[16:37:04] <pauled> A very large program in perspective :)
[16:37:37] <robertmaxrees> kay
[16:37:57] <robertmaxrees> (there are over 600 people here; no need to single me out ;)
[16:38:10] <pauled> true :))
[16:38:16] <Collin_> It seems like IE8 parses my code as it's loaded, is there a way to prevent this?
[16:38:31] <pauled> but most of them are in silence
[16:38:42] <tasaif> hi
[16:38:51] <robertmaxrees> PaulCapestany 'cause you're not talking.
[16:38:55] <robertmaxrees> err, pauled lol
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> Collin_ not sure what you mean.
[16:39:07] <robertmaxrees> you mean wait until the document is ready?
[16:39:43] <Collin_> Actually I have no idea what's going on
[16:39:46] <Collin_> Javascript is so terrible :<
[16:39:56] <robertmaxrees> Collin_ javascript is fine.  what's the problem you're having?
[16:40:02] <Collin_> I think it's running my ready handler before angular.js's ready handler
[16:40:07] <Collin_> Even though angular is included before mine
[16:40:27] <robertmaxrees> why do you say that?
[16:40:43] <Collin_> I have some angular.js scripts at the top of my document, and the DOM elements containing the angular app/control attributes at the bottom. When my scripts run, angular hasn't been initialized yet
[16:40:57] <Collin_> It throws exceptions because it hasn't processed the element with ng-app
[16:40:57] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:41:10] <robertmaxrees> put your code before the closing body tag.
[16:41:21] <Collin_> I moved my code to the bottom and it still happens
[16:41:40] <robertmaxrees> you might have more luck in an angular channel btw.
[16:41:42] <Collin_> According to Angular, it needs to load and do something with the element containing ng-app, or I get this error
[16:41:52] <Collin_> They don't support the version I'm using
[16:42:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:42:28] <robertmaxrees> so you come to an unrelated channel and expect better resukts?
[16:42:31] <robertmaxrees> *results
[16:42:40] <Collin_> Well, it seems like it's running my ready handler before Angular's
[16:42:49] <Collin_> I assume there's some way to ensure mine runs later
[16:43:14] <robertmaxrees> not if your handler is a document ready
[16:44:13] <porkolt> Hi, How to add input dict? $("input").val({"x": "y"});      outputs [object Object]
[16:44:22] <robertmaxrees> porkolt you can't.
[16:44:26] <robertmaxrees> not with val at least.
[16:44:29] <robertmaxrees> it expects a string.
[16:44:43] <tasaif> Collin_: have you tried asking in #angularjs
[16:44:44] <tasaif> ?
[16:44:56] <robertmaxrees> tasaif they told him they don't support the version he's using.
[16:45:14] <Collin_> tasaif: They don't support 1.2
[16:45:28] <Collin_> Is there anything after ready?
[16:45:47] <tasaif> 1.2 beingâ¦. jquery version?
[16:45:52] <Collin_> 1.2 being Angular version
[16:45:57] * Collin_ gives up and sets a timer :|
[16:46:03] <robertmaxrees> Collin_ there's a window load.
[16:46:08] <porkolt> robertmaxrees: Click Get Data button: http://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropper/
[16:46:09] <robertmaxrees> but you need to read the angular docs.
[16:46:20] <robertmaxrees> don't set a timer.
[16:46:23] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea.
[16:46:51] <tasaif> do you have access to the Angular js code?
[16:47:34] <Collin_> Ah
[16:47:38] <Collin_> I found the problem, nevermind
[16:47:51] <tasaif> what was it?
[16:47:55] <Collin_> Angular loads on an event that isn't supported until IE9, but the docs don't explain how to initialize it. I guess I'll read the source
[16:49:07] <tasaif> are you saying angular wasn't loading at all?
[16:49:22] <tasaif> or was loading immediately?
[16:49:35] <Collin_> It's 'loading,' but not doing anything
[16:49:43] <Collin_> Like searching the DOM for ng directives
[16:54:05] <fwwf> https://jsfiddle.net/4qrLogbt/4/ this code works on the fiddle but not on my app, i suspect that it's not specific enough and it matches other stuff in the html
[16:54:10] <porkolt> robertmaxrees: It works: $("input").val(JSON.stringify({"x": "y"}));
[16:54:25] <robertmaxrees> porkolt you were actually trying to display the object as a string?
[16:54:41] <porkolt> yes :)
[16:55:05] <robertmaxrees> ah, fair enough
[16:56:41] <Azrael_-> hi
[16:57:33] <robertmaxrees> fwwf why are you usuing .each() to bind event listeners like that?
[16:57:36] <Azrael_-> is there an option to download jquery ui as a stand alone without the jquery core as a bundle?
[16:57:54] <fwwf> robertmaxrees: not sure some guy helped me with this
[16:57:59] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:58:03] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- jquery core isn't included with jquery ui by default.
[16:58:31] <Azrael_-> ah, ok, thanks
[16:58:53] <robertmaxrees> fwwf what are you trying to do here?
[16:59:37] <Azrael_-> can i use the jquery 1.9.2 ui for jquery 1.9.0?
[17:00:12] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- you can use the most recent version with jq 1.9.0
[17:00:40] <Azrael_-> k
[17:00:43] <Azrael_-> thanks
[17:01:10] <robertmaxrees> fwwf and what about it is broken in your app?
[17:01:33] <fwwf> robertmaxrees: to make the color change when the appropriate color is selected from the palette. but for some reason this example while working in the fiddle, it won't when i'm integrating it in the rest of the app. also it's complicated
[17:01:41] <lambdumb> i passed a unix timestamp from php to jquery to use it as my baseline time for a web application, but on computers with different timezones the time is different? what's up with what?
[17:02:12] <robertmaxrees> lambdumb it's relative to the user's timezone, not GMT iirc.
[17:02:36] <lambdumb> robertmaxrees, that shouldn't matter if the timestamp is from the server?
[17:02:56] <robertmaxrees> lambdumb it's ms from the unix epoch.
[17:03:04] <robertmaxrees> not the unix epoch from GMT.
[17:03:32] <lambdumb> so would different machines parse it based on their timezone
[17:03:37] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:03:40] <robertmaxrees> iirc.
[17:03:45] <lambdumb> oh, ok
[17:03:47] <robertmaxrees> fwwf what about it is broken in your app?
[17:04:09] <lambdumb> i guess i should give it an RFC 2822 date with timezone?
[17:04:24] <robertmaxrees> lambdumb youy need to read about the javascript date() object.
[17:04:28] <robertmaxrees> it's more complicated than that.
[17:04:34] <robertmaxrees> and/or dumb
[17:04:46] <fwwf> robertmaxrees: it doesn't change color when trying in my app.
[17:04:57] <fwwf> so i'm guessing it does not select the right classes
[17:05:11] <robertmaxrees> fwwf let me guess - you just copy/pasted the entire <div id="color_button" class="btn btn-group dropdown btn-xs">?
[17:05:35] <robertmaxrees> something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4qrLogbt/7/ ?
[17:06:15] <fwwf> yes
[17:07:14] <robertmaxrees> your first issue is $("[class*='btn-']").slice(1).each(function(i, e) { isn't what you want.
[17:07:36] <robertmaxrees> your next problem is that $('#current-color') only targets the first one it finds on the page.
[17:08:07] <robertmaxrees> since you can only have each ID once per page.
[17:10:32] <fwwf> robertmaxrees: what do i want instead of the slice line
[17:11:10] <robertmaxrees> i would assume $(".dropdown btn").each(function(i, e) {
[17:12:44] <fas3r> can I create a function like :       var myfunction = function(){ $('#my_form').submit(function(e) { .......                      ?
[17:12:59] <robertmaxrees> you coukld, but why would you?
[17:14:10] <fwwf> robertmaxrees: hm and what about the 2nd problem?
[17:14:18] <robertmaxrees> fwwf i'm looking at that right now :)
[17:14:24] <fwwf> thanks
[17:14:42] <robertmaxrees> in the meantime, check out http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[17:18:39] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: right mouahhah :D
[17:18:51] <fas3r> I dont need actually thanks for that :)
[17:23:24] <robertmaxrees> fwwf https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4qrLogbt/9/ this should get you closer.
[17:23:27] <robertmaxrees> not perfect by any meants.
[17:23:29] <robertmaxrees> *means
[17:26:04] <fwwf> robertmaxrees: looks good! is it good though?
[17:26:16] <robertmaxrees> it could use a lot more cleanup, but you get the basic idea.
[17:26:24] <fwwf> i will try, thanks a lot
[17:33:07] <fwwf> robertmaxrees: no, #current-color stays with btn-black2 class , even if i change the color
[17:33:18] <fwwf> just checked
[17:34:00] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't have that ID any more.
[17:34:07] <robertmaxrees> you can't replicate IDs on the page.
[17:34:11] <robertmaxrees> you need to update the html AND JS.
[17:38:00] <fred1807> robertmaxrees: now working the jquery with var to the php :/  http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/camfhhnL/5/
[17:38:37] <robertmaxrees> that's not what I wrote for you.
[17:38:45] <fred1807> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/camfhhnL/1/
[17:38:50] <fred1807> I tried 5 fiddles
[17:38:57] <fred1807> I am missing something bad
[17:38:58] <robertmaxrees> "not working" doesn't tell me anything
[17:39:19] <robertmaxrees> have you tried echoing out the value to make sure it's working?
[17:39:44] <fred1807> I dont know even this basic, how to debug this?
[17:39:55] <robertmaxrees> that's a PHP question, which I don't know.
[17:39:58] <robertmaxrees> head over to ##php maybe?
[17:40:09] <Collin_> Does anyone happen to know how to read IE8's parsing errors?
[17:40:11] <fred1807> no no
[17:40:17] <fred1807> If I open the php url it works
[17:40:29] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 then what's the issue?
[17:40:35] <fred1807> I can open on the browser  load.php?var=bla, and it writes down to the file :)
[17:40:36] <robertmaxrees> Collin_ like what?
[17:40:44] <Collin_> The line number it's giving me is in the middle of a comment
[17:40:46] <Collin_> http://codepad.org/reHnv674
[17:40:58] <fred1807> robertmaxrees: the jquery is not post the php url correctly
[17:41:07] <Collin_> If I remove the two lines to uncomment it, it reports the errori s at 3844
[17:41:09] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 for the URL.
[17:41:20] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab
[17:41:24] <Collin_> I can't figure out what the 'line' it's refering to is
[17:41:53] <fwwf> robertmaxrees: ah thanks! works now!
[17:42:40] <robertmaxrees> Collin_ huh?
[17:42:53] <robertmaxrees> you're getting an errror when it's commented out?
[17:43:20] <Collin_> Yes
[17:43:25] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[17:43:29] <Collin_> This obviously isn't the source of the error, the line number is wrong
[17:43:31] <robertmaxrees> the issue is probably elsewhere.
[17:44:15] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you delete that block entirely?
[17:44:37] <fred1807> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/js9khe2o/
[17:45:01] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 that's bad code.
[17:45:14] <Collin_> robertmaxrees: It offsets the line it reports by the number of lines I removed
[17:45:42] <robertmaxrees> Collin_ have you tried linting/hinting your code?
[17:45:57] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 this is nothing like what we showed you earlier.
[17:46:27] <fred1807> I have other codes at the page that may interfere with global a functions
[17:46:38] <robertmaxrees> fred1807 this code is absolutely broken and doens't do anything.
[17:46:39] <fred1807> for example, backround color changes with every click
[17:47:05] <fred1807> so I need some hardcode unglyness
[17:47:07] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't matter - thsi code will never run.
[17:47:09] <robertmaxrees> no you don't.
[17:47:37] <fred1807> it cant be complicated to include a var on that
[17:47:42] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:47:51] <robertmaxrees> show me an example of your html.
[17:47:55] <robertmaxrees> i need to see what i'm working with.
[17:48:11] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to jhardcode anything, and this makes no sense on its own.
[17:48:19] <robertmaxrees> var = data - variable isn't a valid thing.
[17:51:03] <fred1807> robertmaxrees:   http://paste.ee/r/X6CFg   It is very simple, it is a page , with music playing infor from mpd (music player linux)
[17:51:22] <fred1807> there is a "love button"  that writes down the now playing track name to a text file
[17:51:29] <robertmaxrees> first off - don't use onclick
[17:51:47] <robertmaxrees> second off - do you have multiple "luv" ids on the page?
[17:52:01] <fred1807> only 1
[17:52:21] <fred1807> this function now is not for the love thing
[17:52:26] <fred1807> love thing is already working
[17:52:31] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:52:39] <robertmaxrees> where's the broken JS then?
[17:52:54] <fred1807> not here hehe
[17:52:57] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:53:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to play this game duder.
[17:53:05] <fred1807> this is what I got working without the new thing
[17:53:08] <robertmaxrees> fiddle up an example of the html and js.
[17:53:23] <fred1807> ok
[17:53:38] <robertmaxrees> just the stuff you're trying to get to work.
[17:53:53] <robertmaxrees> i have to leave, btw.
[17:53:55] <robertmaxrees> so...
[17:54:20] <fred1807> ok thanks anyway
[17:54:27] <fred1807> :)
[17:54:28] <robertmaxrees> my advice to you is that if you want the best help possible, you need to be really explicit about what you want - provide an actual example of the code.
[17:54:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not being very clear, which makes it hard to help.
[17:54:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd also check out learn.jquery.com if I were you.
[18:09:19] <Azrael_-> hi
[18:18:38] <Azrael_-> godlike, newest jquery ui with old jquery 1.9.0 working like a charm :) thanks to all the devs!
[18:22:43] <tocka> *bows down*
[18:37:25] <Azrael_-> i'm using jquery.ui to display a table in a modal dialog. i set the width of a table-cell to be bigger but when i display it, the width isn't used. any ideas?
[19:45:20] <webb> is it more optimized to do : "find element that has class X, if it exists, remove it" VERSUS: "$(all).removeClass(X)"
[19:45:28] <webb> (pseudo code)
[19:50:39] <webb> its a subtle question i guess, let me be more specific
[19:50:47] <webb> this: $('li.mm-selected').removeClass('mm-selected')
[19:50:58] <webb> versus this: $('li').removeClass('mm-selected')
[19:51:09] <webb> ealuate performance
[19:51:36] <webb> i think the first one is more efficienct
[19:51:50] <webb> because youre mutating less dom objects
[19:57:34] <felipedvorak> Hi, can somebody please tell me why I keep getting an error saying $ is undefined here? http://fixee.org/paste/lagk3eu/
[19:59:29] <felipedvorak> more specifically it says its undefined on line 5 where I define the $select variable
[20:00:24] <felipedvorak> This isn't my code, its from a Tutsplus tutorial, and it works in the video, but I just can't understand why it doesn't work for me :(
[20:01:42] <kevireilly> felipedvorak: youâre sure jquery is included on the page before this script?
[20:02:18] <kevireilly> it would say $select if that were the issue, but Iâm pretty sure its the `$` function call that follows
[20:02:41] <felipedvorak> kevireilly: Well, I haven't tinkered with the HTML that came with the example, and there is a jquery script tag... I'll try updating the link
[20:03:08] <felipedvorak> kevireilly: Already trying substituting the $ for _ or nothing and its the same :(
[20:03:44] <kevireilly> felipedvorak: yeah that wont help, in some cases substituing jQuery for $ might though
[20:04:11] <kevireilly> felipedvorak: perhaps paste the HTML?
[20:04:32] <felipedvorak> sure, one sec
[20:04:59] <felipedvorak> just updated the jquery link to the one currently on jquery.com but nothing
[20:05:17] <kevireilly> eh?
[20:06:16] <felipedvorak> http://fixee.org/paste/d52tjyc/
[20:07:59] <kevireilly> felipedvorak: should be ok, perhaps a jsfiddle.net instead?
[20:10:00] <felipedvorak> just tried on codepen and nothing
[20:15:44] <felipedvorak> jsfiddle and nothing, omg :p
[20:16:10] <felipedvorak> its not my code, I could just leave it but not im really curious...
[20:16:29] <felipedvorak> will try loading it in the head and using document ready
[21:23:19] <Felishia> :o
[21:23:23] <Felishia> hello?
[21:23:34] <Felishia> eeesda
[21:24:04] <Felishia> that was weird... my computer wants to type itself... poor oldie computer XD
[21:31:45] <Felishia> damn freenode is so good :o
[21:32:01] <Felishia> when I come here I always find a solution to the problem
[21:32:07] <Felishia> even before I've asked the question
[21:39:40] <felipedvorak> I can't find a solution to my problem T_T
[21:55:21] <DragonPunch> okay, i have an on click listener on an element with class of ".groups-heading" however, i am appending children to it and whenever i click the children it is counting it as a '.groups-heading' click
[21:55:25] <DragonPunch> how do you fix this issue?
[21:56:57] <felipedvorak> kevireilly: Still can't solve it... manage to make it work using codepen but the same code doesn't work in other places. Nor jsfiddle, nor Chrome or Firefox...
[22:00:12] <felipedvorak> DragonPunch: Can you paste the code?
[22:02:38] <BillCriswell> canvas is weird
[22:15:54] <DragonPunch> Okay, so when I click a parent element the click event is fired when I click on the child of the parent as well. How do you fix this.
[22:18:52] <Felishia> oh >:c
[22:18:56] <Felishia> whats wrong?
[22:19:14] <Felishia> the event is not triggered when I click one element
[22:21:43] <felipedvorak> DragonPunch: Paste the code at something like fixee.org so we can see
[22:21:43] <Felishia> worst it works in jsfiddle
[22:23:24] <Felishia> now I seriously don't get it
[22:23:37] <felipedvorak> Felishia: code?
[22:23:40] <Felishia> I hate when the code works in jsfiddle but doesn't in the browser context
[22:23:49] <Felishia> http://jsfiddle.net/bv0r0o1u/
[22:23:59] <Felishia> it's the same damn code >:c
[22:24:07] <Felishia> but it doesn't work when I run it alone
[22:24:13] <Felishia> however in jsfiddle does
[22:24:20] <Felishia> so I don't get it
[22:24:40] <DragonPunch> felipedvorak: hey I fixed it :)
[22:24:50] <DragonPunch> how do you toggle() a dynamically added element?
[22:26:07] <felipedvorak> DragonPunch: hiding it and showing it?
[22:26:14] <DragonPunch> yah
[22:27:02] <Felishia> aaaaa
[22:27:14] <felipedvorak> Felishia: you are using a coma
[22:27:21] <felipedvorak> instead of just a space inside the selector
[22:28:14] <Felishia> no, it's not that actually I removed everything else that was non needed and the code worked
[22:28:20] <Felishia> so I don't get where it is
[22:29:12] <Felishia> sometimes the event triggers sometimes it doesn0't
[22:31:23] <Felishia> 37th time I click, the event is not triggered... why so randomly?
[22:35:15] <felipedvorak> Felishia: if I click forward and backward it alerts, elsewhere it doesn't, what is the behavior you want?
[22:36:04] <Felishia> felipedvorak, that one exactly... actually I got the problem... an invisible element created by a plugin called jquery spin that was included was in the middle of my view
[22:36:42] <Felishia> that's why it worked perfectly in jsfiddle
[22:36:52] <Felishia> because that thing was not included
[22:37:07] <felipedvorak> Felishia: :) nice
[22:37:25] <Felishia> felipedvorak, T___T these sort of problems make me cry
[22:37:36] <Felishia> like you check the code 100 times and it's perfect
[22:37:45] <Felishia> and it's just a plugin messing
[22:38:44] <felipedvorak> that can drive someone insane sometimes :p
[22:42:36] <Felishia> know if jquery needs to set say
[22:42:43] <Felishia> .css(-webkit-box-shadow
[22:42:47] <Felishia> .css(box-shadow
[22:42:51] <Felishia> .css(-o-box-shadow
[22:42:57] <Felishia> like all the css variants?
[22:43:03] <Felishia> or it does it automatically?
[22:45:26] <felipedvorak> Felishia: As far as I know, it automatically adds
[22:47:10] <Felishia> who invented css propertary features anyway? u.u
[22:47:51] <Felishia> the only one we really need is -webkit-outline
[22:48:29] <Felishia> meh no
[22:48:32] <Felishia> -webkit-text-strok
[22:48:34] <Felishia> -webkit-text-stroke
[22:48:47] <felipedvorak> https://jquery.com/browser-support/
[22:49:01] <Felishia> yeah that one, is "really" necessary, messing with so much shadows is crazy u.u
[22:49:18] <felipedvorak> It seems it was implemented after v1.8
[22:51:54] <felipedvorak> I wish I could do the fancy stuff with CSS but as of right now I'm very reliant on other peoples code to do fancy stuff T_T
[22:52:28] <Felishia> :o
[22:52:33] <Felishia> you work with that?
[22:53:48] <felipedvorak> By fancy I mean all the drawings and animations... I can find my way with CSS to do regular development stuff
[22:55:14] <felipedvorak> Like this http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/full/PwLXXP/
[22:55:17] <felipedvorak> T___T
[22:55:21] <felipedvorak> I can only cry
[22:58:43] <Felishia> felipedvorak, OMG so cool <3
[22:58:49] <Felishia> it's ultra cute!+
[22:59:03] <felipedvorak> Felishia: Yep... blew my mind :D
[23:00:14] <Felishia> only CSS :o
[23:00:20] <felipedvorak> ^
[23:00:28] <Felishia> yes XD
[23:00:36] <felipedvorak> XD

[23:29:53] <felipedvorak> Felishia: Felishia  http://a.shinynew.me/post/4641524290/jquery-ui-nested-sortables

[23:32:26] <felipedvorak> Yaeh, watch Adventure Time (at least thats what cartoon shows now)
[23:32:48] <Felishia> discovery channel then :p
[23:33:19] <Felishia> that's what I usually get... I don't want an horror movie scaring me :< programmers get easily scared
[23:33:57] <Felishia> http://geekshumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Programmers-are-easily-scared%E2%80%A6.jpg
[23:34:25] <felipedvorak> loool hahahaha
[23:35:44] <felipedvorak> You should definitely watch more cartoons then... they are hardly scary.. well, theres Marceline...
[23:36:38] <Felishia> oh... the weird vampire girl :o
[23:36:49] <Felishia> no courage scares me more
[23:36:55] <Felishia> that dog geez!

[23:39:00] <Felishia> mmm... I'm confused with this nestedSortable thing
[23:39:06] <Felishia> Corage
[23:39:11] <Felishia> Coraje!
[23:39:35] <Felishia> sip :3
[23:44:01] <felipedvorak> Felishia: It seems like nestedSortable just receives an object with 3 keys, the rest are optional stuff
[23:44:07] <felipedvorak> is
[23:47:14] <Felishia> felipedvorak, actually things have to be a list, I understood everything else, but if it wasn't a li element it wouldn't work... that's why it wasn't working...
[23:49:52] <felipedvorak> :)
