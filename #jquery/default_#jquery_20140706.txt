[00:11:00] <ZacHarney> @systemfault Do you know how I could make the blur work for the sticky footer as well as header? Or can it only really work on the header OR footer not both?
[00:11:24] <doni> hi
[00:11:35] <systemfault> ZacHarney: I don’t know, sorry.
[00:12:19] <ZacHarney> That's alright. I tried a few ways myself earlier but couldn't figure it out. I'll just leave it on header, and maybe make footer more opaque
[00:26:09] <doni> any refence to make a dropdown by clicking and shows the accordion content?
[01:03:38] <scar> how can i find an item based on if it has a class that contains a word? lol
[01:03:45] <scar> i have a lot of addon-#-some-name
[01:03:52] <scar> and the # always changes, but not "some-name"
[01:05:28] <scar> probably using .each() on a more specific class (to try and isolate), then do a .replace() on each class of each item found and see if it matches? lol
[01:05:32] <scar> sounds exhaustive on the browser?

[02:09:01] <rivarun> hello. how would i go about getting the next general sibling in jquery? i could use $("current ~ next")[0], but i already have "current" as an object
[02:10:17] <rivarun> i've tried .next("next"), but that seems to return [0] of "current"
[02:14:14] <mjau-mjau> Hi, got a question about vars inside a plugin and accessing them from a click event ...
[02:15:03] <mjau-mjau> Basically I got some vars set i the plugin something like this: this.options = $.extend(defaults, options) ... normal stuff
[02:16:07] <mjau-mjau> then I have some elements within the object where I apply a click ... this.$nodeButtons.on('click' ...
[02:16:27] <arthurvr> rivarun Isn't this what you mean? http://jsfiddle.net/vT6Xr/
[02:16:34] <mjau-mjau> how can I see access the options object from within the on click function?
[02:19:11] <rivarun> arthurvr: yes. but i always see next() used in lists. perhaps this is my problem. i want to look inside the <li> in which i already am
[02:20:54] <arthurvr> rivarun If you wanne look inside, i think you simply have to use $().find()
[02:31:13] <rivarun> arthurvr: jumping to parent (which is the <li>) and then using .find() on that, seems to work.
[02:41:52] <rivarun> hm, actually that won't do it. i need to access the element next to the one i have. i'll need more same elements in that <li>
[02:46:16] <rivarun> http://jsfiddle.net/vT6Xr/ .next(..) doesn't seem to jump over those label fields
[02:56:23] <rivarun> bah, whatever. wrapped everything in <div>s
[03:33:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Can anyone explain why this is returning false? http://jsfiddle.net/xmWMU/
[03:59:36] <sacho> ecky--ptang-zoob, jquery doesn't play well with svg elements
[04:00:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it has to :(
[04:00:59] <sacho> (The specific reason is that .className, which is what jquery uses to work with classes, returns and object and not a string for svgs)
[04:01:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so how to deal with this?
[04:02:29] <sacho> well, if you're catering to newish browsers, you can trivially use .classList.
[04:02:38] <sacho> e.g. icon[0].classList.add('iconic-red')
[04:02:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that's terrible
[04:03:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> newish = FF3+ ?
[04:05:11] <sacho> what's terrible?
[04:05:35] <sacho> http://caniuse.com/classList
[04:07:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> handling it that way is weird
[04:07:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> chrome 34+ oh shit
[04:08:44] <sacho> ok, so handle it another way.
[04:46:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> sacho: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8638621/jquery-svg-why-cant-i-addclass
[04:46:56] <sacho> ..?
[04:47:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[04:48:41] <sacho> why are you showing me that link?
[04:48:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> because it's a different way of setting the class on a svg
[04:49:19] <sacho> I'm aware
[04:49:34] <sacho> you already said using classList is terrible, I can't imagine how awful setting the class attribute directly must be
[04:50:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why is that more or less awful?
[04:52:43] <sacho> because you need to keep track of all the classes.
[04:52:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah

[09:28:47] <kode101> should i bother with jquery for loading an external image url into a canvas?
[09:28:52] <kode101> or can i do it with pure js pretty easy
[09:29:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if that's the only thing you need to do I wouldn't load a complete library
[09:37:01] <decx> it's easy
[09:37:40] <decx> var myimg = new Image(); myimg.src = 'url'
[09:38:01] <decx> and then you can ctx.drawImage(myimg,x,y)
[11:27:50] <thoraxe> ok, what the heck am I doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/dG7pZ/3/ -- the validate doesn't seem to work at all / do anything
[11:36:50] <thoraxe> http://jsfiddle.net/dG7pZ/7/ even simpler
[11:36:53] <thoraxe> losing my mind here...
[11:37:27] <jParkton> thoraxe: http://jsfiddle.net/dG7pZ/8/
[11:38:12] <thoraxe> jParkton: i see you added a ton of stuff, but not sure what I was doing wrong
[11:38:36] <thoraxe> jParkton: and yours doesn't do anything either
[11:38:50] <jParkton> nope
[11:39:16] <jParkton> you would need to add handlers I assume
[11:39:25] <jParkton> onThis: dothis
[11:40:05] <jParkton> http://jqueryvalidation.org/reference/
[11:41:33] <thoraxe> jParkton: look at the example, it doesn't use any handlers: http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/
[11:41:53] <thoraxe> or anything on the demo page: http://jqueryvalidation.org/files/demo/
[11:41:58] <thoraxe> in fact, i'm using it elsewhere just fine without handlers
[11:42:04] <thoraxe> for some reason, it's behaving very oddly in jsfiddle
[11:42:20] <jParkton> maybe its a jsfiddle issue?
[11:43:20] <thoraxe> perhasp
[11:44:00] <thoraxe> lemme try jsbin
[11:48:27] <thoraxe> http://jsbin.com/gupubamu/3/edit same thing
[11:48:34] <thoraxe> what the heck is going on
[11:50:27] <thoraxe> seems like required just doesn't work
[11:51:16] <jParkton> if it works local ytou can only assume it is a website issue
[11:51:54] <thinkxl> thoraxe you need to make reference to the name attr, not the id
[11:52:00] <thinkxl> thoraxe http://jsbin.com/gupubamu/4/edit
[11:52:08] <thoraxe> huh?
[11:52:27] <thoraxe> omg
[11:52:29] <thoraxe> that's ridiculous
[11:52:32] <thoraxe> how did i miss that

[12:28:53] <gordian> is there an efficient way that I can "ignore" the .clearfix divs in my markup when I get the index of a certain selector? http://jsfiddle.net/silb3r/h8z9W/
[12:29:16] <gordian> basically when i click "program 3" i'd like the index (+ 1) to alert "3"
[12:29:37] <gordian> but i will never know how many .clearfix elements there may be in the markup
[12:29:48] <systemfault> Then don’t use index…
[12:29:53] <systemfault> What do you want do to?
[12:30:28] <gordian> when a program is clicked i want to alert its index, but without the clearfix elements taken into account
[12:30:37] <gordian> i don't know what else to call it so i'm calling it index
[12:30:51] <gordian> if there is another word/name for that then please correct me
[12:32:10] <systemfault> Why do you need that number?
[12:32:22] <systemfault> Can you use an attribute instead?
[12:32:41] <systemfault> Using .index creates fragile code..
[12:33:16] <gordian> i'd prefer to use index if i can
[12:33:31] <gordian> just all those damn .clearfix mucking up the markup
[12:40:56] <gordian> systemfault: got it with data atts, thanks
[13:06:38] <wtm0422> Hello! I'm trying to bind a function to every link of a class that does the following: when it's clicked, it will reveal the (by default hidden) UL contained within. I tried $(".my-item").bind("click", function() { $(this ul).fadeIn(200); }); but it doesn't work
[13:06:43] <wtm0422> What should I try instead?
[13:07:43] <systemfault> wtm0422: A selector is a string, you cannot do $(this ul) and expect it to work
[13:08:06] <systemfault> wtm0422: What you can do is $(this).find('ul')
[13:08:07] <wtm0422> OK, so how can I make a selection for {whatever is clicked}
[13:08:10] <wtm0422> aah ok
[13:08:13] <wtm0422> that makes more sense
[13:56:09] <wtm0422> One more question -- if I want to select a class that's inside "this" (but not the same class anywhere else), how can I do that? (this) is not a string but ".myclass" is
[13:56:49] <wtm0422> is .find just really inefficient or is it the only way?
[14:14:03] <Cork> wtm0422: you want to select a child of the current element?
[14:14:20] <Cork> then yes .find is what you want (and no it isn't inefficient=
[14:14:25] <Cork> *)
[14:14:46] <wtm0422> thanks :)
[14:27:42] <Jon30> is there some kinda plugin that would allow me to manage page partials? (similar to the way angularjs does it but more simple)

[15:31:45] <mubi> hey all I want to run an ajax call AFTER my submissions is complete: here is my submission code in coffeescript: 	$("#new_cheque").submit ->
[15:31:46] <mubi> 		$.post(this.action, $(this).serialize(), null, "script");
[15:31:47] <mubi> 		return false;
[15:32:21] <mubi> if I replace the null, now for some reason the page refreshes
[15:32:40] <mubi> replace the null with the ajax call (which is the success condition)
[16:05:47] <jParkton> if I have three divs and I want to select div[whatever] how doI do that in jquery?
[16:05:58] <jParkton> $('div'[0])?
[16:06:05] <jParkton> I know that isnt right lol
[16:06:22] <burnt_> give them a class
[16:06:34] <jParkton> oh
[16:06:38] <burnt_> eg <div class="clickable" ... >
[16:06:39] <burnt_> then
[16:06:43] <jParkton> nein nein
[16:06:53] <jParkton> the dom is an array?
[16:06:54] <burnt_> $(#clickable)?
[16:07:07] <jParkton> lol
[16:07:08] <burnt_> $(#clickable).bind ... for example
[16:07:22] <burnt_> that will get the class clicked then use this to get the details
[16:07:25] <jParkton> I guess I can do it like document.body[20]
[16:07:35] <burnt_> hang on ill give you a demo
[16:07:36] <jParkton> just selecting
[16:07:46] <jParkton> I can do it simple with classes and ids
[16:10:12] <burnt_> if you give them the same class, then use $('.yourclass').click(function(event){ echo $(this).text() });
[16:10:28] <burnt_> every click will echo of the text for each div with the class "yourclass"
[16:10:45] <jParkton> yeah
[16:10:56] <burnt_> so you can know which div you are clicking
[16:12:00] <burnt_> or give it another value eg <div class="yourclass" someothervalue="1"> then use $('.yourclass').click(function(event){ echo $(this).attr('someothervalue') });

[16:13:31] <burnt_> then you have your other value, so if you are creating and populating divs on the fly, you can put the id of the record into the id or other attribute of the div and select it via click using the above text

[16:17:29] <burnt> anyone had the problem when making an ajax call on a html <a> link and the ajax call is aborted
[16:18:00] <burnt> but if you stop the file download using return false; the call works np
[16:19:28] <KMoth> Hmm... Are you using preventDefault()?
[16:22:22] <burnt> KMoth yeah it stops the file being downloaded
[16:22:36] <burnt> I want the file to download and make an ajax call at the same time
[16:22:50] <burnt> I only know its crashes because fire bug shows it in colsole
[16:22:54] <burnt> it makes the call
[16:23:03] <burnt> but the browser cannot process the return
[16:23:24] <burnt> BUT if i prevent default or return false (same thing in this case) then the call works np
[16:23:58] <burnt> I have even removed all code from the ajax side so it just posts to a file that returns blank and it still crashes
[16:24:10] <burnt> tested in all browsers, same result
[16:24:21] <jParkton> weird
[16:24:47] <burnt> I know it fails, because it shouldupdate the page with a value from a database, but when I refresh the page it loads
[16:25:03] <burnt> so it has made the call but not been able to process the response
[16:25:11] <jParkton> asynch
[16:25:51] <burnt> but if I prevent default then it makes the call and updates the page, I think the file dialog prevents updating the page or something
[16:44:46] <burnt> jParkton thanks it was asynch
[16:45:09] <burnt> I usualy use push to send a file, just updating some legacy stuff, muc appricated

[19:14:36] <mubi> why won’t my coffeescript fire?
[19:14:59] <mubi> but keep in mind, that tdtag is generate after an ajax call dynamically changes the html
[19:15:22] <mubi> it should still work
