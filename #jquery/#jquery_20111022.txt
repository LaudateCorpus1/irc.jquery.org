[00:10:31] <jaypitidi> http://jsfiddle.net/qWMG6/2/ ---- How can I get the divs to collapse once they are clicked?
[00:14:47] <ndss56> wat you mean by collapse?
[00:15:08] <jaypitidi> well it is like an accordian menu
[00:15:17] <jaypitidi> the li's once clicked will show a div
[00:15:29] <jaypitidi> i want the div to collapse when the li is clicked again
[00:16:16] <jaypitidi> collapse meaning hide
[00:17:24] <brantwynn> use toggle()
[00:17:30] <brantwynn> with two functions
[00:17:47] <vloomington> hello. i'm developing a plugin using the widget factory. what's the best way to have an api where general methods that apply to the entire plugin to called?
[00:18:47] <jaypitidi> brantwynn: just getting back familiar with jquery
[00:18:48] <jaypitidi> thanks
[00:18:48] <vloomington> for example, $.myPlugin.doSomething(), notice there's no selector. should i just add something to $.myPlugin? $.myPlugin = ...?
[00:19:25] <brantwynn> yeah man np
[00:25:26] <jaypitidi> toggle( effect, [options], [speed], [callback] ) what are the available options?
[00:25:51] <brantwynn> well you can use toggle in another way
[00:26:39] <brantwynn> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[00:27:29] <brantwynn> so you'd put the show() in the first function and the hide() in the other
[00:27:53] <jaypitidi> I see
[00:42:18] <motaka2> hello , I have three select boxes , All have the  name id_water_centers , I want when hode two among those three , after the submission of the form , it send me the value of the selected select option not the last one appearing in the form , regardless of it display option
[00:49:44] <jaypitidi> i have a hidden div inside a li element. when the li is clicked it will show the div and when I click the li "or the div" again it will hide the div. How do I stop it from hiding the div if the div is clicked rather than the li?
[00:50:29] <motaka2> jaypitidi: can you help me?
[00:54:40] <jaypitidi> I don't understand your problem
[01:02:57] <motaka2> jaypitidi: i use this:  $("#id_water_centers_vlg").css('display' , 'none');  to not to show a select box , but not onely i need not to show it I also need it to be totally removed from the dom , but if I use remove then I cant return it back
[01:03:18] <ravenzz> ?remove @ motaka2
[01:03:18] <bot-t> motaka2, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[01:03:40] <ravenzz> store that into a var before to remove it
[01:03:44] <motaka2> ravenzz: thats right but what if I wnat to return it bacjk ?
[01:18:31] <motaka2> ravenzz: I need something that can remove a form element from the form but if i need it back I can return it back
[01:18:40] <motaka2> no one can help me?
[01:19:46] <ravenzz> remove? or hide?
[01:22:24] <nights> hm
[01:22:37] <nights> i have this problem which i find difficult to solve
[01:22:39] <ravenzz> var foo = $('div #foo');
[01:22:39] <ravenzz> foo.remove();
[01:23:07] <nights> i basically append a form input to create a dynamic list of email addy input
[01:23:16] <nights> however, the form input need to be indexes
[01:23:18] <ravenzz> and then you can do $('div').append(foo)
[01:23:18] <nights> indexed
[01:23:23] <ravenzz> again
[01:24:51] <ravenzz> ?
[01:25:38] <ravenzz> so you have this form.
[01:25:48] <ravenzz> You add an input field
[01:26:11] <ravenzz> its value is an email address
[01:26:18] <ravenzz> then you would be able to remove that element?
[01:34:20] <jaypitidi> I'm having some trouble with the jquery hover() method. Right now when I hover over my div it will change the background position, when I hoverOut it will change the background position back to its default. If I click the div it will show a div beneath it (like an accordian menu). I would like it if I could keep the hover state while the hidden div is visible. How can I do this?
[01:46:38] <jaypitidi> http://jsfiddle.net/k2kqm/
[01:55:15] <dangerousdave> Not the best with jquery, can someone suggest a general approach for what i am trying to achieve please? I have a grid of photos, and when they are clicked on, an opaque overlay will be animated on top of the entire picture, the overlay will contain some dynamically set text. I have the images, and the onclick handler working, just trying to figure out the best way to apply the overlay. thanks
[01:59:41] <jaypitidi> maybe append an absolutely position div
[02:02:12] <nights> ravenzz: yes, but i need to increase the index for each element i add
[02:02:34] <nights> the only way i can think of is to make a async call and have some cookie counter
[02:02:35] <nights> which is aweful
[02:10:46] <jaypitidi> Can I used can i use bind() with 'hover'
[02:25:01] <solsTiCe> hi. it's been 2 times that I can't do anything in $(document).ready()  when I have loading images. even when taking care to wait for their laod (with js .onload or jquery load event) it fails randomly for some image in IE and even opera. I had to use window.onload. as if load event is never fired or fired incorectly. so it's really a bug or my code ?
[03:42:14] <Hornet> http://snook.ca/technical/jquery-bg/
[03:42:32] <Hornet> could somebody please explain why $(this).stop().animate({backgroundPosition:"(-150px 0)"}, {duration:500}) works on that example?
[03:42:53] <Hornet> documentation suggests it should be '-150px 0', no brackets
[03:43:09] <Hornet> and indeed it works without brackets on my page, but 'snaps' rather than animates
[03:46:12] <rgr> when doing a jquery ajax call with datatype set to "json" does one still have to json.stringify(record) passed in the data field?
[03:48:11] <rgr> still having problems understanding just what is and what isnt encoded. I am passing a record of which one field contains html.
[03:53:31] <dziczkowski_> hi, what to do ?   change()    adds   DOM element,  ... when  not  (':checked') removes it, but user can make "tricks", when clicking and unclicking very fast. Then DOM just can't remove new element very fast, because ajax calls must be made before that too each time.
[03:53:49] <dziczkowski_> maybe somehow close capability of unclicking ?
[03:59:59] <Whirl3d> I have a series of divs that have id's like "Contact" for example. When I display the div, I need to check to see if a function exists named, "initContact" and run it if it does. How can I do that?
[04:00:09] <Hornet> I must admit, I'm confused as to why jquery doesn't animate background position natively
[04:00:31] <Hornet> it CLAIMS to, but doesn't, and a bug report on the matter just bounces to 3rd party scripts
[04:00:44] <Hornet> either it needs to clarify the situation, or have native support
[04:02:01] <Whirl3d> How can I check to see if a function named "something" is defined and if it is, run it?
[04:02:02] <Hornet> if (typeof initContact == 'function') { initContact(); }
[04:02:21] <Hornet> you could have googled that tbh
[04:02:26] <Hornet> http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/determinevar2.shtml
[04:02:46] <Whirl3d> hornet, thanks for the smartass reply. I have googled it a dozen or so times and you didn't answer my question.
[04:03:30] <Whirl3d> I have the name of the function as a string and need to evaluate whether a function of the same name as the string exists.
[04:04:18] <Whirl3d> var funcName="init"+$(this).attr("id"); if (typeof funcName=='function') will always fail because typeof funcname=='string'
[04:05:48] <DThought_> Whirl3d: of course, you reference the name by funcName
[04:06:01] <DThought_> window[funcName] could work, but i'm not 100% sure on that
[04:06:49] <Whirl3d> I'll try that. I tried about a million other combinations, but never thought to use window[funcname]... thanks DThought_
[04:06:56] <DThought_> >>> atob
[04:06:56] <DThought_> atob()
[04:06:56] <DThought_> >>> window["atob"]
[04:06:59] <DThought_> atob()
[04:07:07] <DThought_> returns the same function...
[04:07:11] <DThought_> it should work
[04:09:56] <dziczkowski_> sincerely, ... this chat is only for Requests, not for response, as noone ever answered my question
[04:10:07] <Whirl3d> DThought_, thanks a lot. I think it's gonna work great.
[04:10:38] <Whirl3d> dziczkowski_, perhaps it's just you. I'm on here every day and I get great help from lots of people.
[04:11:15] <Whirl3d> dziczkowski_, what is your question?
[04:13:56] <Whirl3d> One more quick question: What is the preferred way of adding a single element to an existing jquery collection.  example: var buttons=$("#abutton"); var others=$(".buttonClass")...how do I combine the two and keep the result as a jquery collection?
[04:15:03] <Whirl3d> ?.extend
[04:15:03] <bot-t> jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[04:18:50] <Whirl3d> dziczkowski_, really? That's all the input you are gonna offer? Nobody (except obviously me) is gonna beg you to submit a request, so come on with it.
[04:20:29] <Hornet> [12:02] <Whirl3d> hornet, thanks for the smartass reply. I have googled it adozen or so times and you didn't answer my question.
[04:20:30] <Hornet> [12:03] <Whirl3d> I have the name of the function as a string and need toevaluate whether a function of the same name as the string exists.
[04:20:39] <Hornet> you didn't say you had it as a string
[04:21:02] <Hornet> for what you posted I did actually answer it
[04:21:15] <Hornet> but it's academic now
[04:27:18] <Whirl3d> Hornet, my apologies. I thought it was clear when I used quotation marks. You should be proud that you answered correctly though you weren't able to help.

[05:32:56] <clockwize> guys, how do i simulate a user typing text in to a input box?

[05:33:32] <clockwize> but to no avail
[05:38:21] <Jaac> Hmm, do have to say YUI compressor does a good job, it does need some manual work, but it works great.

[06:21:53] <Elephant> but the php script gets hit, does it DB magic.
[06:22:42] <Elephant> Is there a difference in action='javascript:;' and using prevent default?
[06:23:24] <Misiur> Elephant: Ever heard of progressive enhancement?
[06:23:38] <Elephant> nope
[06:23:40] * Elephant googles
[06:24:10] <Misiur> You never should make unable to use form in case someone has JS turned off
[06:24:43] <Elephant> Oh man, and I wouldn't write DB queries with addslashes(), but here I am :(
[06:25:40] <Elephant> I was gonna use the excuse that this is a "web appliance" so not really a website, but the point still stands.
[06:25:56] <Elephant> this needs to be re-written but the client would not like that :/
[06:26:30] <Kamakazi> those are always fun
[06:27:25] <Elephant> The form is in a fancybox, so they would never see it with JS turned off hehe.

[06:30:14] <Misiur> in fact, you can skip action attr, then it will point to the same document

[07:27:00] <sarspazam> when using a multitude of plug ins for a website, is it bests to combine them into one .js file

[08:07:37] <cakehero> I need them to be unique for each element and also have them accessible from each function
[08:08:11] <cakehero> The closest example I can think of is in another language this would be like a new instance of an object with it's own instance variables, but it seems like in JS I have to do it differently
[08:10:45] <Tallisman> Hi guys :)
[08:11:27] <cakehero> hi Tallisman
[08:12:06] <stew-a> if i have a <select> with lots of options, some of which have the same value with different labels, how can i select the correct option?
[08:12:34] <cakehero> stew-a what are you trying to select, by value or by label
[08:13:32] <stew-a> by a combination of value and an arbitrary attribute on the <option element
[08:13:51] <Tallisman> I've got a little problem considering my AJAX requests & jquery, When I perform a .get request, I have the problem that I need to wait until that request is completed, before continuing to the next step. So until now I have fixed that using callback functions, but it is getting a little bit clumpsy, how can you add more overview to your code when everything needs to wait for ajax to complete?
[08:15:14] <mats_> i have an element which has an height animate on hover, how do i make sure that it slides over the element below and not pushing it down?
[08:16:13] <Spabby> mats_ make it absolute or relative positioned
[08:18:54] <mats_> Spabby: it already is relative. weird.

[08:37:47] <tristan_> i think i might be burning out because this is such a common problem, but for whatever reason i can't get any plugin to co-operate, i tried coding something from sratch, and i tried a nasty css solution...
[08:38:09] <tristan_> it's a very common problem, vertically aligning a span withing a p.
[08:39:30] <tristan_> i guess i could go old school and bust out a table, but ew.
[08:45:36] <kul> I have made 1 tool tip. When I hover in it I shows 1 div (fadeIn) and fadeout when I mouse out. but problem is when I mouse over quickly on all the divs the tooltips i popping on all the boxes which I dont want. I want only the tooltip of the last element which was hovered
[08:45:58] <kul> For example
[08:46:06] <kul> http://www.vishalgrp.com/ink.html <--- hover on 1st 3 logos

[09:07:24] <patricx> hi  to  you  all

[09:08:42] <Hierofant> OT:  anyopne here have experience customizing tumblr?
[09:08:47] <gar_onn> do you want all divs to be hidden the moment you hover an other?
[09:09:05] <gar_onn> kul, shouldent tooltip be placed at left:0 ?
[09:09:16] <gar_onn> *shouldn't
[09:09:25] <kul> hi gar_onn
[09:09:45] <kul> yea I have changed the position to bottom now
[09:10:28] <mats_> ok, so i have a div element as relative, and my height animate on hover still pushes the div below down, instead of sliding over it. what am i missing here?
[09:11:25] <kul> but my concern is when i quickly hover on all the logos like 1st i hover on box number 1 and then 2 ,3  .. and 5... I want jquery to show only content for 5 th box. So I want to stop all other events and call only the last event
[09:11:27] <gar_onn> url or fiddle mats_  ?
[09:11:38] <gar_onn> kul
[09:11:53] <gar_onn> Add to your mouseover thing:

[09:12:14] <kul> tes ?
[09:12:17] <kul> *yes ?
[09:12:48] <kul> Oww yea I'll try that
[09:12:55] <kul> kool idea :)

[09:13:34] <cH40z-Lord> is there any easy to to iterate safely through a well-formatted XML-file which may have multiple child-nodes which also may have child-nodes ?
[09:13:59] <cH40z-Lord> example at http://testing.blackcorestudios.de/test.xml
[09:14:29] <cH40z-Lord> Movie -> x Childs -> more childs
[09:15:07] <dabear> children*
[09:15:13] <cH40z-Lord> pff :P
[09:15:30] <cH40z-Lord> Childs is the name of the node :D
[09:15:52] <dabear> why are you using xml? json would be better
[09:16:08] <mats_> gar_onn: here http://jsfiddle.net/ktUY5/ - very basic things. just did this to try to see if it works and if something else caused it not to work in my  bigger document. but this doesn't work. i'm new so it's probably something easy which i miss :)
[09:16:10] <cH40z-Lord> because I export 15.000 nodes with my c# application
[09:16:20] <dabear> also you need to define what you mean by "iterating safely"
[09:16:22] <cH40z-Lord> and it's easier to serialize it as XML than JSON
[09:16:36] <cH40z-Lord> I need to iterate step-by-step through each node
[09:16:56] <kul> gar_onn Thanks a lot :)
[09:17:00] <kul> It works now!
[09:17:02] <cH40z-Lord> If I use $(this).find("Childs"); then I'll get ~10k nodes
[09:17:29] <dabear> $(this).children() gives immediate children
[09:17:39] <cH40z-Lord> $(this).find("Childs").first(); also doesn't help because a Movie-object can have multiple Childs-Nodes
[09:17:59] <cH40z-Lord> hmmm
[09:18:02] <cH40z-Lord> good idea :)
[09:18:53] <cH40z-Lord> nice
[09:18:58] <cH40z-Lord> looks like I can work with that :)
[09:19:12] <cH40z-Lord> sometimes it's easier than expected :D thanks so far guys :)
[09:19:27] <dabear> hm, am I multiple persons?
[09:20:05] <gar_onn> mats_, what should happen?
[09:20:41] <cH40z-Lord> haha :D no. thought someone else replied too :)
[09:20:47] <mats_> gar_onn: i want the test div to "slide" over the test2 div rather than pushing it down. if you understand what i mean hehe
[09:20:50] <cH40z-Lord> dabear thanks again :P
[09:21:57] <butterfly> hi ;)
[09:22:06] <ravenzz> hi
[09:22:16] <dabear> hi!
[09:22:23] <mats_> what i'm doing is basically hiding a part of a div which contains text, and that should slide down upon toggle/hover, but when it does - the dom gets messy. it should slide down over the elements below rather than pushing them down
[09:22:44] <mats_> i don't know the lingo for this very good, so it might sound weird; what i'm trying to explain
[09:23:00] <mats_> very well
[09:23:00] <gar_onn> try adding a css 'top: ??' to the #test's
[09:23:10] <dabear> mats_: so set position: absolute on it

[09:25:36] <mats_> dabear: if i use position absolute on the div that expands, the other div is nowhere to be found? it disappears hehe
[09:26:12] <ravenzz> mats_ so the yellow one should overlap the red one?
[09:26:13] <dabear> gotta set top/right too
[09:26:58] <mats_> ravenzz: yep that's the word to use
[09:27:11] <ravenzz> mats_ and do they have a fixed height?
[09:27:22] <mats_> dabear: ok, i'll look into that a bit

[09:40:51] <Sephi-Chan> Hi
[09:41:22] <imanc> hey folks - i have a fancybox that is loading a page in an iframe, but when I click the submit button it closes the box.  I was wondering how I can have the fancybox remain open and display the results of the post?
[09:41:24] <imanc> any ideas?
[09:42:05] <Sephi-Chan> Can I add data to a request in the "beforeSend" ajax event ?
[09:44:45] <butterfly> Why If I add attr to div, with php, and I alert this.attr, i have error in IE 7.0 ?

[09:52:08] <Hierofant> Hey all.  I have a a <p> <embed>   how would I refer to this generically for styling in JQuery?  would it be:    $(embed).width();  ?
[09:52:54] <ngharo> $('embed')
[09:53:13] <butterfly> ngharo, Not work with 'data-' in IE 7
[09:53:13] <Hierofant> ngharo says undefined.
[09:53:15] <Sephi-Chan> ngharo: Yep it's what i'm going to do if i can't do it in the ajax:beforeSend provided bt Rails jQuery UJS.

[09:56:42] <ngharo> got a demo?
[09:57:59] <butterfly> ngharo, In Chrome, Opera, FF it work, but in IE I have error "object does not support this property or method"
[10:03:14] <ngharo> butterfly: so this fails also? http://jsfiddle.net/7fGtU/2/
[10:05:55] <Hierofant> ngharo - I actually am trying to edit the HTML for a tumblr account.  It's a 3-column layout.  When I post videos as a text post, it shows within the 3-column layout shrunk down (100% width).   When I click the post (and go to its page), the video is not properly upscaled to 100% width - it remembers the previous formatting size of the 3-column layout.  See: http://thiscrit.tumblr.com/ click
[10:05:55] <Hierofant> one of the video posts
[10:10:05] <ngharo> Hierofant: $ is being clobbered

[10:11:01] <Hierofant> thx
[10:11:13] <ngharo> jQuery('embed') will probably work
[10:13:17] <butterfly> ngharo, It's not work too.
[10:13:31] <Hierofant> wow.. there are lots of libs going into this page, so I need to wrap my mind around the noConflict.  Tried as its own script declaration but said $ was not a function
[10:13:35] * Hierofant tries agaion
[10:14:45] <ngharo> butterfly: i dunno; i dont have access to IE .  My only suggestion is to make sure you're using the latest jquery 1.6.4
[10:20:06] <ignas> is there a way to create an "ajax" object so I could execute it later?
[10:21:15] <ignas> like do  var later = $.ajax({not_now: true}); later.execute();
[10:22:10] <ngharo> var foo = function() { $.ajax( ... ) }; foo();
[10:24:28] <ignas> that does not allow me do: var later = $.ajax({not_now: true}); later.completed(function() {  }); later.execute();
[10:24:49] <ignas> before executing it
[10:25:34] <ngharo> ?ajaxsetup
[10:25:34] <bot-t> jQuery.ajaxSetup(options): Set default values for future Ajax requests. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[10:25:47] <ignas> yeah, but that one is global
[10:26:01] <ignas> i can't have 2 or 3 different objects with different urls that way
[10:35:14] <gnarf> ignas: it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that
[10:36:11] <Hierofant> Has anyone tried to inject code into a TUMBLR post?
[10:36:12] <gnarf> ignas: 1.6?
[10:36:17] <ignas> gnarf, yeah
[10:36:53] <imanc> is anyone famliar with fancybox?
[10:38:03] <gnarf> ignas: https://gist.github.com/d615e4c0f814606a56c4
[10:38:26] <gnarf> use .done() and .fail() to attach callbacks
[10:39:18] <ignas> gnarf, hmm, yeah, that would cover most of the usecases I have, thanks
[10:39:33] <last1> can jQuery be compatible with other libraries that also listen for events ?
[11:00:51] <ericandrewlewis> i'm trying to bind a function to when a user switches tabs, trying this:

[11:02:12] <ericandrewlewis> oh actually i got it with $(document) rad
[11:03:02] <ericandrewlewis> now just to work on collision detection :P
[11:08:04] <patricx> please  how  to link css to an event

[11:08:47] <patricx> .testt  is   a  class
[11:17:46] <jschoolcraft> If I'm cloning something to insert it back into the DOM is there a way I can change the id and have a reference to it?
[11:17:51] <Hierofant> Does anyone know if <embed width="320" height="240"> is un-settable using the box model?  I'm failing at it using Tumblr.com's interface
[11:18:37] <techouse> i got an anchor link with an image background and that image is a triangle. is there any way to make jquery limit the activity of the anchor link to that triangle? i tired html maps, but it's a bad practice if i wanna keep it seo
[11:18:46] <techouse> any ideas that come to mind?
[11:19:53] <jschoolcraft> https://gist.github.com/48bf2a384d59fe36e4cc
[11:25:50] <ericandrewlewis> so that the transparent area outside the triangle isn't clickable?
[11:27:36] <techouse> ericandrewlewis: yes
[11:27:55] <techouse> i mean, i wanna keep the html markup as simple as possible
[11:28:44] <techouse> i tried <img usemap="mymap"></img> and then define the link in the map area, but that ain't no good, especially since the content is gonna be generated dynamically
[11:28:57] <techouse> as will the link
[11:29:38] <ericandrewlewis> yeah i dunno about that, sorry.
[11:29:42] <techouse> so i simply made an <a class="triangle" href="mylink"></a> and defined the bg in the css
[11:29:57] <techouse> i mean, it works, but it's a square instead of a triangle to click on
[11:30:44] <bittyx-laptop> hey, can i get some help with using the history api in this channel? i'm having sort of a logical barrier while using it in a certain scenario, but i'm not sure if it's off-topic here (fwiw, i'm using jquery)
[11:30:47] <techouse> unless if i make a separate map for every content that's gonna be generated, but that's kinda overkill just for a button
[11:31:15] <bittyx-laptop> basically - i'm not sure how to correctly handle errors when fetching new pages
[11:31:47] <bittyx-laptop> as it is now, i have a function that does a $.post() and has .success() and .error() bound, where success replaces the content in the page, and error shows a dialog with a warning
[11:32:47] <bittyx-laptop> now, this function is called on a 'statechange' event (i'm using History.js, but it's basically a 'popstate', if i understand correctly), so to even begin the ajax request, i have to first do History.pushState(...)
[11:33:09] <bittyx-laptop> but pushState changes the URL immediately, without knowing whether the request succeeded or not
[11:33:28] <bittyx-laptop> and i'd like to only change the URL if the request was successful
[11:35:10] <tensory> bittyx: I don't know History.js structure, but is it possible to make the pushState call from within the success handler for the ajax request?
[11:36:01] <tensory> or do you have to wrap the whole post request in pushState?
[11:36:47] <tensory> got my own nasty event question if anyone's very good at deduplication sorts of problems.
[11:38:20] <tensory> wondering why my callback function for xmpp presence is running 3 times and not one.
[11:50:41] <bittyx-laptop> hey tensory, sorry, my connection broke
[11:51:09] <bittyx-laptop> last i saw you write was "or do you have to wrap the whole post request in pushState?" after which i wrote 3 lines... mind repeating if i've missed anything?
[11:51:21] <ericandrewlewis> has anyone made a 2d scroller in jquery
[11:51:52] <tensory> bittyx, heya, I missed all of your messages
[11:51:56] <tensory> ok, trying that again
[11:52:04] <bittyx-laptop> tensory: ah, but that's the thing - the 'statechange' (or 'popstate' if you will) function has to call the ajax loader, so as to handle clicking the back button (basically, when you click Back, the state changes to the previous state, and an ajax call is fired to the server to fetch the previous page)
[11:52:05] <bittyx-laptop> so History.pushState(...) fires a popstate event, just as clicking the back button does
[11:52:07] <bittyx-laptop> and the popstate event is the only way to detect clicking the back button, so the function bound to that event has to do the $.post() call
[11:52:59] <tensory> ah, got it
[11:53:54] <bittyx-laptop> i haven't worked with the history api previously, and the official mozilla guide said to use History.js to ensure compatibility across different browsers, so that's how i got to using that
[11:54:42] <tensory> if you explicitly call $.post() in the function bound to popstate, maybe you could wrap the post call in a try/catch block and throw an exception in the ajax response handler
[11:55:24] <tensory> but… I just learned last night that exceptions thrown from callback functions can't get caught
[11:55:35] <bittyx-laptop> yeah, but to execute the function bound to popstate, when following a link on the page, i have to do History.pushState(...) - and this alone causes the URL change, so i'm not sure that would work
[11:55:43] <tensory> oh. right.
[11:55:56] <tensory> um… what constitutes an error where a URL change is concerned?
[11:56:16] <bittyx-laptop> well, say i'm on site.com/page-1 and i have a link to /page-2
[11:56:41] <bittyx-laptop> the link gets overriden with jquery (event.preventDefault()) and fires a post call to fetch just the content that needs to change
[11:57:26] <bittyx-laptop> to be more precise, i bind History.pushState(...) to the 'click' event on that link, and the 'popstate' handler fires the $.post call and replaces the content
[11:57:47] <bittyx-laptop> however, if the $.post() call fails for any reason whatsoever (e.g. temporary connection problems), i don't really want to change the URL
[11:58:08] <bittyx-laptop> i just want to display a message that the call failed and stay on the current URL (obviously, without replacing any of the content)
[11:58:27] <tensory> what about calling preventDefault() in the post error handler?
[11:59:42] <bittyx-laptop> hmm, i haven't tried that actually, sounds like a good idea (though i'm not sure it will work)...
[11:59:45] <bittyx-laptop> hold on a sec
[11:59:54] <tensory> like: error(function() {preventDefault(); $('#error-message').show();}),
[12:00:11] <tensory> I'm just tossing out ideas unfortunately. I'm not totally sure it would work either, but I'm working on my sense of patterns that stick in JS.
[12:00:43] <tensory> I dropped in here to see if I could get help deduping my callback responses, then I moved the handler assignment somewhere a bit more logical and that fixed it.
[12:00:57] <bittyx-laptop> nah, this doesn't work, but sounded promising
[12:00:59] <tensory> aww
[12:01:28] <bittyx-laptop> yeah, i'm actually thinking that perhaps my logic is flawed, and trying to find out how people usually handle this
[12:03:10] <bittyx-laptop> thanks for trying to help anyway, gotta go now
[12:03:11] <bittyx-laptop> bye
[12:09:30] <maltray> guys, i have an <input type="file", its supossed to just have images there, so.. i want, that each time it changes, if its value is not '', and if its an image (all of this is already done), i want it to show the image in other div, i've tried val() but val() wont show me the full path to the image, can someone give me a hand over here?

[12:14:12] <alessioalex> Hello, is it ok for me to respond with JSON and 403 html error code or 401 ?
[12:18:44] <RedOrigin> hey there, how do I turn hyperlinks into click event handlers?
[12:19:36] <maltray> well
[12:19:39] <maltray> its easy xD
[12:19:51] <RedOrigin> so instead of linking to, they now load the data for.
[12:19:57] <maltray> $('#myaelement').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[12:20:17] <maltray> e.preventDefault(); will prevent the browser from going to the URL in that A element
[12:20:28] <RedOrigin> Hurray! thanks maltray, sorry for my newness
[12:20:48] <maltray> its fine :), i remember that one day i was like you too and it costed me a bit to find out a solution lol

[12:48:44] <upmauro> help, i have one array, but JQuery each dont looping this, http://www.upmauro.com/help_jquery_each.png, look array "usuarios_unicos".
[13:17:58] <rgr> I cant really give a twiddle for this but hopefully the description gives some idea : using ajax I call back to the php side and get a response that contains html. That html contains a div which in turns contains something of the form "<script src='ddd'/><script>var blah; etc;</script>. The problem is that when I replace the old element with the new element the entire page is getting lost and only the script part is shown. A refresh and
[13:17:58] <rgr> all is fine. Is there some issue with including script components in html and converting that into a jquery element and thenreplacing an existing element? Vague I know but...
[13:20:26] <rgr> hmm google says jquery executes the script in the div in the global space when appending. rats.

[14:45:48] <KostasDi> how would you check that the array contains the correct elements?
[14:46:03] <maltray> depends on what u call correct elements

[14:46:40] <KostasDi> for example with playing cards, how would you check that its 45
[14:46:40] <maltray> still not get ur point
[14:46:47] <KostasDi> 4 5 j 7
[14:47:39] <KostasDi> ok.. still with the playing cards example
[14:48:28] <KostasDi> say there is a 4 a 5 and a j (wild card) in the array

[15:04:38] <js_node> dabear: http://jsfiddle.net/Zr9CY/14/ - corrected syntax, still not working
[15:06:17] <dabear> mats_: I think your issue is that the change event isn't triggered
[15:06:19] <maltray> dabear : sry, i just fixed it http://jsfiddle.net/AZZtb/6/
[15:06:23] <dabear> because the value is correct

[15:07:49] <maltray>         $('#lala').html('<img src="'+$(this).val()+'"/>');, instead of $(this).val(), it must be something like $(this).address(); or something like that, i dont know wich property its

[15:09:17] <js_node> dabear: http://jsfiddle.net/Zr9CY/14/ still not working
[15:10:08] <maltray> Hmm, k, i see now.. is it any way to do it then?
[15:11:09] <maltray> i would make it via ajax, but... as we didnt see that yet on school, and its not involved with this project, i cant use it
[15:11:21] <maltray> so i need to figure out a way to do it locally
[15:11:27] <maltray> what a pain in the ass.
[15:13:40] <dabear> maltray: there are ways to manipulate file contents locally before uploading to a server, but that is supported only by a few browsers
[15:13:49] <grid_> hey
[15:14:30] <dabear> js_node: try "50px"
[15:14:31] <maltray> i really dont care about browsers compatibility, thanks god its just for school and not for a customer lol., can u tell me ways to do that dabear?
[15:16:17] <js_node> yeah, dabear its working..
[15:16:36] <js_node> thanks, dabear
[15:17:13] <dabear> maltray: I haven't used it at all my self. but google for filesystem io javascript or something
[15:17:46] <dabear> maltray: I doubt that's somethinf required by your teacher though
[15:18:38] <dabear> requestFileSystem() etc
[15:19:50] <RedOrigin> hey sorry to bug you guys, but how do you select an element by id instead of using class?
[15:20:07] <ajpiano> $("#foo")
[15:20:48] <maltray> yah i dont know really dabear, if its required.. but well, my partner says that yah its, and he attended more to class than me, lol.
[15:20:50] <dabear> maltray: there is also FileReader, File, FileList etc
[15:20:55] <maltray> ill google about it dabear, thanks
[15:20:56] <maltray> :)
[15:21:08] <dabear> maltray: what is your task exactly?
[15:21:09] <maltray> gotta save it on a notepad, i have to go now
[15:21:09] <RedOrigin> cool I did have that right then, I was a little confused because of the . after the $("#foo")
[15:21:28] <ajpiano> RedOrigin: $("#foo.bar") is id and class, for instance
[15:21:33] <dabear> RedOrigin: do you know css? jquery selectors are just like css
[15:21:36] <dabear> (mostly)
[15:21:36] <maltray> let me get into google docs and ill show u
[15:21:52] <ajpiano> maltray: any class where you *can't* use AJAX but *can* use any bleeding edge HTML5 APIs .... sounds really bizarre
[15:21:52] <maltray> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_deal_a_day
[15:21:55] <maltray> i have to make a system like that
[15:22:04] <RedOrigin> Yep I know css, ajpiono cleared my confusion
[15:22:11] <maltray> ill have to think about it then ;/
[15:22:24] <RedOrigin> *ajpiano I mean, sorry about that.
[15:22:38] <maltray> for now, we just have to make validations and according to my partner, the inputs, its easy, just using append, but this img thing is kinda worring me

[17:57:42] <dogarrhea2> hi people
[18:01:09] <dogarrhea2> when it comes to "good design" vs performance, who wins? performance when you need it and good design everywhere else?
[18:04:01] <brizk> Depends on whether u are on a budget or not
[18:04:21] <brizk> Definitely keep a good design on the base tho...
[18:04:37] <brizk> Less u want headaches in the long run
[18:12:43] <dogarrhea2_> so i'm using .children()  on a div with 12 divs underneath it
[18:12:53] <dogarrhea2_> how do you index these children?
[18:17:14] <wookiehangover> ?eq @ dogarrhea2_
[18:17:14] <bot-t> dogarrhea2_, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[18:17:18] <wookiehangover> nice nic, lol

[18:18:53] <dogarrhea2_> it all goes back to when my sister was having diarrhea in China
[18:21:28] <dogarrhea2_> bah. parentElement.eq(1).attr("id") is undefined..
[18:21:33] <dogarrhea2_> does it only work on list items?
[18:21:49] <wookiehangover> children().eq() ....
[18:21:59] <wookiehangover> ya, it has to be applied to a set
[18:46:24] <Matias_> Hello
[18:46:39] <Matias_> is there a way to redirect to another page using POST and some data?
[18:46:54] <Matias_> something like an AJAX call but I want to browser to handle the response
[18:50:41] <tensory1> Matias, you could use a redirect in the script endpoint of the ajax call (though that would cut off the ajax request prematurely) or put the redirect in the success handler.
[18:50:46] <tensory1> Argh, IRC.
[18:53:18] <Matias_> the problem is that I need to browser handles the response, it'll be an application/pdf
[18:53:29] <Matias_> the browser*
[18:54:18] <Matias_> I need to send the server some parameters using POST and it'll return the PDF file
[18:55:56] <skamikaze> Matias_: maybe check out how sourceforge handles automatic download start ;)
[18:56:08] <Matias_> good idea!
[18:56:31] <Matias_> thank you
[18:56:35] <skamikaze> yvw
[18:57:01] <Dantman> You trying to force download?
[18:57:25] <Matias_> not to force but to start one automatically
[18:57:52] <Matias_> I mean, it's binary, it's not "forced" :P
[18:58:04] <Dantman> iirc those are usually done by just sending the user to that url
[18:58:32] <Dantman> Links are just links pointing to the url... automatic on-page ones are usually a window.location redirect
[18:58:52] <Dantman> When the user hits the url the browser prompts for download instead of changing the page
[18:59:13] <Dantman> And the download itself is forced either using a Content-Type ack, or Content-Disposition
[19:00:10] <dogarrhea2_> how do you find the x/y value of a mouse click relative to a div
[19:00:13] <dogarrhea2_> is there only pageX and pagey?
[19:01:05] <Matias_> Dan-H, the problem is that the server needs some POST parameters
[19:02:02] <Dantman> Not the best way to do things...
[19:02:10] <Dantman> But you could fake a form post if you need it
[19:03:38] <Matias_> how would you fake it without adding a form to the DOM?
[19:04:37] <Matias_> I think the main difference is that sourceforge uses GET parameters instead so they can do a normal redirect
[19:18:55] <js_node> Hi
[19:19:04] <js_node> http://jsfiddle.net/THbLk/
[19:19:23] <Dave_Stein> js_node: what is the question
[19:19:26] <js_node> can someone please look into, http://jsfiddle.net/THbLk/
[19:19:59] <js_node> when i change the drop down the selected texts are displayed on the red colored div
[19:20:31] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[19:20:37] <Dave_Stein> that looks like what you want
[19:21:02] <js_node> when i type somthing into the red colored div and then change the drop down, the text is appearing in the next line
[19:21:14] <js_node> i want them in the same line
[19:22:33] <js_node> say for example, i type "This is a" then i select the drop down and select cow, Then i type "it gives milk" - similar to auto suggestion
[19:23:32] <dogarrhea2_> hrm. there is  quite a bit of lag when i use element.offset().left
[19:23:39] <dogarrhea2_> like .5 ms
[19:24:15] <dogarrhea2_> probably something else
[19:28:02] <Dave_Stein> js_node sorry i disappeared a sec
[19:28:15] <Dave_Stein> js_node just talk with my name in the sentence and my client blinks
[19:28:29] <js_node> ok
[19:28:35] <js_node> ok, Dave_Stein
[19:28:46] <Dave_Stein> js_node: i am getting everything on the same line
[19:28:54] <Dave_Stein> what browser are you doin that in?
[19:29:14] <Dave_Stein> oh oh when you type sorry
[19:29:38] <js_node> if you type some thing and then select from the drop down, the selected text is appearing in the next line, Dave_Stein
[19:29:47] <js_node> yeah
[19:29:53] <js_node> yeah Dave_Stein
[19:30:11] <Dave_Stein> it's not always
[19:30:19] <Dave_Stein> if i refresh the fiddle and then type and then immediately go
[19:30:20] <Dave_Stein> it works
[19:30:30] <Dave_Stein> sometimes, FF is putting in a BR tag for no good reason
[19:30:43] <Dave_Stein> like if i hit return
[19:30:51] <Dave_Stein> and then type some more and inspect
[19:30:55] <Dave_Stein> you can see an extra br on the botom
[19:31:24] <Dave_Stein> you might want to insert based on cursor position instead of just blindly appending
[19:33:02] <acidjazz> why doenst jquery .change fire when using arrow keys on a <select>
[19:33:05] <js_node> yeah, that's a good suggestion Dave_Stein
[19:33:21] <Dave_Stein> acidjazz: i hate that too, its a browser thing
[19:33:28] <Dave_Stein> acidjazz, it'll fire change if you blur after doing that
[19:33:30] <acidjazz> its happening in FF
[19:33:34] <Dave_Stein> acidjazz: so i usually just bind to keyup and change
[19:33:47] <acidjazz> is there a fix?
[19:33:53] <acidjazz> hmm
[19:34:25] <Dave_Stein> does exactly what you want with nothing negative i can think of, other htan possibly firing change if user hits "N" twice and there's only one "N" option
[19:34:34] <Dave_Stein> but i'd imagine your callback can check the current value vs the last if it were an issue
[19:35:44] <acidjazz> sweet dave that works
[19:36:00] <acidjazz> tnx
[19:37:54] <simon> I'm making something clickable that expands a <div>. I'd like the something appear like a hyperlink, but I don't want it to href="#something" since that resets the viewport. should I href="javascript:something?" instead, or what's the most recent trick?
[19:40:59] <fris> simon or use preventDefault
[19:41:41] <simon> I see an example at http://www.adipalaz.com/experiments/jquery/everything_expanded.html where href="#", but it doesn't reset the viewport!
[19:41:43] <RedOrigin> hey there, how do I grab unique ids that are located in a specific div and store the ids as an array?
[19:42:53] <Brodingo> ?map @ RedOrigin
[19:42:53] <bot-t> RedOrigin, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[19:43:30] <RedOrigin> Awesome. Thanks Brodingo
[19:45:30] <simon> fris, thanks.
[19:59:18] <js_node> Dave_Stein: http://jsfiddle.net/THbLk/4/, position of cursor is always staying 0,0
[19:59:58] <Dave_Stein> js_node: i meant position of cursor within contenteditable, like the blinking text cursor - not the mouse pointer
[20:00:07] <Dave_Stein> getting that info is a lot more complicated
[20:31:15] <Fernandos> Hi
[20:32:07] <Fernandos> do you know where to get an interactive worldmap?
[20:32:12] <Fernandos> a plugin maybe?
[20:36:03] <kvda> Fernandos, google maps?
[20:36:04] <dogarrhea2_> how do you get your elements that are appended to resize properly
[20:36:56] <Fernandos> kvda: how would you create an interactive map out of google map? I mean if you click amerika it should show the countries inside amerika and if you click a city it should show link to a page
[20:37:20] <kvda> Ah right
[20:37:36] <kvda> something like http://polymaps.org/
[20:37:44] <Fernandos> oh thanks dude
[20:37:51] <Fernandos> checking out
[20:41:59] <Dave_Stein> dogarrhea2_ can you clarify?
[20:42:19] <dogarrhea2_> i have a div on the screen with some images. they are margin 0: auto
[20:42:30] <dogarrhea2_> whenever i click an image, i append something on top of it
[20:42:40] <dogarrhea2_> when i resize the browser, everything gets weirded out
[20:42:47] <jrockjiggz> dogarrhea2_: sounds like a css issue
[20:42:50] <Dave_Stein> so you mean you add something to the body
[20:42:54] <Dave_Stein> and css it to overlay right
[20:43:10] <dogarrhea2_> hrm i don't know anything about overlay
[20:43:17] <Dave_Stein> you cant append on top of something
[20:43:25] <Dave_Stein> append technically puts something below, or inline depending on CSS
[20:43:25] <dogarrhea2_> i just $("<div></div>") and append that
[20:43:41] <Dave_Stein> can you do a fiddle
[20:43:44] <Dave_Stein> ?jsfiddle @ dogarrhea2_

[20:43:53] <Fernandos> kvda: hmm it seems to be only a drag&drop plugin not really interactive.
[20:44:23] <Fernandos> it's a classic google map but with different data layering and overlays and pins
[20:49:44] <dogarrhea2_> Dave_Stein: hrm Jquery http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/overlay/  does the same thing
[20:50:01] <dogarrhea2_> when the overlay pops up and you zoom in/out it does not stay fluid
[20:50:08] <dogarrhea2_> it's exactly the same behavior
[20:50:44] <Fernandos> dogarrhea2_: which browser?
[20:50:52] <dogarrhea2_> chrome
[20:51:22] <dogarrhea2_> mixing the margin 0 auto with these kinds of overlays is messing thigns up
[20:51:28] <Fernandos> I think that's more a css issue than a javascript one, no?
[20:51:41] <Fernandos> hmm
[20:52:06] <dogarrhea2_> it might be.. but jquery overlay is still bugged
[20:52:16] <dogarrhea2_> when i see it in the browser and ctrl + scroll wheel
[20:52:35] <Dave_Stein> sounds lkike you just need to reposition the overlay when you scroll
[20:52:45] <Dave_Stein> im off for now tho
[20:54:35] <Fernandos> dogarrhea2_: I googled a stackoverflow result http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570232/css-jquery-vertically-and-horizontally-center-div
[20:55:44] <dogarrhea2_> that's not what i'm trying to do
[20:56:08] <dogarrhea2_> http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/overlay/   click the picture.  then ZOOM in and out
[20:56:11] <dogarrhea2_> no scroll
[20:56:21] <dogarrhea2_> it does not stay still.
[21:01:23] <kvda> Fernandos1, pretty sure you can make polymaps interactive
[21:02:25] <dogarrhea2_> so basically jquery overlay is blatantly broken
[21:07:24] <Fernandos1> kvda: I looked around a bit and found www.netzgesta.de/mapper/ but the license is weird have to contact the guy for a price.
[21:07:49] <Fernandos1> sorry I mean www.netzgesta.de/mapzoom/
[21:08:09] <Fernandos1> that guy made freaking many javascript projects..
[21:08:32] <Fernandos1> but the design is stuck in the 90s :P
[21:17:01] <Fernandos1> kvda: ok, the best ones I found are http://playground.mobily.pl/jquery/mobily-map.html http://gmap.nurtext.de/examples.html and http://www.drasticdata.nl/DDDrasticMap.php can you help me choosing one?
[21:17:40] <dogarrhea2_> bah event.pageX is so annoying
[21:17:51] <Fernandos1> I've to do lots of geo jquery work next week too so I think choosing one I can reuse for the other project would be smart
[21:18:02] <Fernandos1> if I knew which one ..
[21:36:06] <eago> hi, anyone uses fancybox? I was wondeirng if is it possible to make it cover the whole screen with a solid color
[21:37:20] <Fernandos1> eago: I guess fancybox supports callbacks you could run function that adds a div as overlay and styles it's background in your fav color
[21:37:38] <Fernandos1> not sure if it's supporting that by default though
[21:37:50] <eago> ya, problem is they're website is down so can't see the docs :(
[21:38:00] <eago> their
[21:38:15] <Fernandos1> you can have a look in the plugin if it's not minified
[21:38:33] <Fernandos1> usually the options available are at the bottom of the file
[21:39:12] <eago> ok, i'll do that
[21:39:14] <eago> thanks
[21:39:18] <Fernandos1> you're welcome
[21:40:09] <Fernandos1> eago: could you maybe tell me which library to choose from  these:  http://playground.mobily.pl/jquery/mobily-map.html http://gmap.nurtext.de/examples.html
[21:40:32] <Fernandos1> I am not sure which one is the best
[21:42:40] <Tobsn> anyone an idea which API (data) is better - 4sq or yelp?
[21:43:17] <Fernandos1> Tobsn: maybe the guys in #php know those apis better. not sure

[21:44:12] <Tobsn> :P
[21:44:24] <Tobsn> (no seriously, the #php channel just sucks, nothing about the language)

[21:45:40] <Tobsn> Fernandos1, mostly because if you ask a newbie question you get ignored or made fun of, if you ask a serious question they try to convince you youre doing it wrong and if you ask a very advanced question they all act like you dont exist
[21:46:10] <Fernandos1> quakenet #php maybe then?
[21:46:18] <Tobsn> same thing
[21:46:31] <Tobsn> the majority of php coders is very "special"
[21:46:49] <eago> Fernandos1 : sorry, wouldn't know
[21:47:41] <Fernandos1> I'm not sure but I'd try to find out which of those APIs is more wanted. http://www.google.de/trends?q=yelp%2C+foursquare&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0
[21:47:53] <Fernandos1> eago: np. thanks anyway dude
[21:49:18] <Fernandos1> if google has interest in yelp then it's the best bet, but only if google doesn't buy them. because they usually kill their projects or inherit them in their own ones
[21:49:45] <Tobsn> see the problem is
[21:49:52] <Tobsn> i think 4sq has in general more data
[21:50:01] <Fernandos1> ie. there is a huge rewrite of google shopping that I know of which is due to a acquisition by them
[21:50:05] <Tobsn> because yelp focus more on only restaurants
[21:50:16] <Fernandos1> and the company they bought is assimilated now
[21:50:39] <Tobsn> hmm
[21:50:49] <Tobsn> yeah dont know if thats an indicator
[21:50:49] <Fernandos1> why not write a wrapper so you can use both APIs and combine the data?
[21:50:56] <Tobsn> since they mostly tend to buy and shut down
[21:51:03] <Tobsn> yeah was thinking about that too
[21:51:04] <Fernandos1> they buy talent
[21:51:11] <Fernandos1> or at least try
[21:51:41] <Fernandos1> I think if you know howto cope with redundant data then you're set. the wrapper could solve that.
[21:52:16] <Fernandos1> so that the params you enter into the methods in the wrapper class don't occur twice for api1 and api2
[21:52:20] <Tobsn> yeah, in general i could go by that if i request both apis and i get 20 results of "places" around a location i can assume that 90% are the same name
[21:52:27] <Fernandos1> merging is difficult I think
[21:52:43] <Tobsn> see i think its pretty easy until you hit stupid cases
[21:53:03] <Fernandos1> if you solve merging though I think you've an advantage.. idk the output of their APIs so I've no idea
[21:53:05] <Tobsn> like "Pho Lucky" vs "PhoLucky" vs "Pho Lucky's"
[21:53:19] <Fernandos1> ah that's "easy"
[21:53:23] <Tobsn> yeah sortof
[21:53:30] <Tobsn> but then it starts getting funny
[21:53:36] <Tobsn> because you might also want to have the category
[21:53:37] <Fernandos1> quicksilver scoring algorithm or phonetic search
[21:53:39] <jrockjiggz> ?getScript
[21:53:40] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[21:53:41] <Tobsn> and i think they are totally different
[21:53:58] <Tobsn> oh, you know a bit about algos?
[21:54:04] <Fernandos1> you don't need to write that yourself, just find a library giving you phonetic search. I think lucene comes with it
[21:54:07] <Tobsn> im looking for a very simple one for a different problem
[21:54:23] <Fernandos1> sure, but what about?
[21:54:53] * Fernandos1 jrockjiggz helps himself by asking the bot :) cool
[21:55:05] <Tobsn> hmm, dont know how to describe it, i rather give you an example, i want to sort data by "size"... lets say i have 100 fields starting from 0 = 1,203,040 and 99 is 3,940
[21:55:18] <Tobsn> its decreasing upwards
[21:55:24] <Tobsn> or downwards, however you look at it
[21:55:31] <Tobsn> i want to group the data by size
[21:55:35] <dogarrhea2_> so if you have a draggable item, (you have to use position absolute with pixels) and you also have a margin auto 0 item, how the heck do you keep the 2 things in sync when the window resizes?
[21:55:56] <Tobsn> so everything above ~500,000 goes stays in its own bucket, everything under it gets slowly grouped more and more
[21:55:57] <Fernandos1> k I know what you mean
[21:55:59] <dogarrhea2_> i can't seem to find anything out there.. everything that is draggable breaks when you use margin auto 0
[21:56:00] <Tobsn> its like a courve
[21:56:09] <Fernandos1> classification
[21:56:12] <Tobsn> yeah
[21:56:38] <Tobsn> so as smaller the number as more and more it gets grouped with others around it
[21:56:47] <Fernandos1> there are many ways to classify data into groups. I've no clue without a semantic context
[21:57:08] <Tobsn> its just to have everything above 500,000 in its own bucked and than start grouping more and more
[21:57:32] <Tobsn> there is not much context
[21:57:39] <Tobsn> its for grouping interests
[21:57:46] <Tobsn> but i guess that doesnt really matter
[21:58:15] <Fernandos1> doesn't sound hard to me, but I think I cannot help you there. have a deadline ;)
[21:58:17] <jrockjiggz> hey, would anyone know how to how to getScript() multiple scripts?  this isn't working..  $.getScript('script.js', function(){ $(this).getScript('script2.js', function(){ $(this).dosomethingreallyawesome(); }); });
[21:58:23] <Tobsn> lol okay
[21:58:37] <Tobsn> you at least have a topic in mind i can search for?
[21:58:41] <Tobsn> classification was a big help
[21:58:43] <Tobsn> anything else?
[21:58:47] <Fernandos1> clustering
[21:58:51] <Tobsn> ah yes
[21:58:53] <Tobsn> thanks!
[21:59:04] <Fernandos1> np. can you do me a little favor?
[21:59:07] <Tobsn> sure
[21:59:23] <Fernandos1> which one to choose? http://playground.mobily.pl/jquery/mobily-map.html http://gmap.nurtext.de/examples.html
[22:00:12] <Tobsn> poland vs. germany
[22:00:20] <Fernandos1> I have to use it for this project where I built an interactive worldmap and the next one is similar to yours. you enter addresses and it geocodes them and puts a marker for it
[22:00:28] <Fernandos1> lol :D
[22:00:46] <Tobsn> hmm the polish one is for creating your own maps with own map images?
[22:00:52] <Tobsn> seems like the german one is better
[22:01:12] <Fernandos1> hmm
[22:01:23] <Tobsn> yep go with the german one
[22:01:40] <Tobsn> seems like more of a "project" than the other one
[22:01:47] <Fernandos1> the polish guy recommends to use a vector map http://speckyboy.com/2011/01/01/vector-world-map-collection-redux/
[22:02:54] <Tobsn> putting the geolocation by text isnt that hard
[22:03:13] <Tobsn> thats just one more function wrapped into that thing
[22:03:21] <Tobsn> the german one just seems more mature
[22:03:24] <Fernandos1> yeah but you need a database containing the geodata to an address
[22:03:51] <Tobsn> nah not really
[22:03:54] <Tobsn> google give you that
[22:04:06] <Fernandos1> ok I'll use the gmap thanks a lot
[22:04:21] <Fernandos1> true. goolge can geocode
[22:04:25] <Tobsn> http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/services.html#Geocoding_Object
[22:04:37] <Fernandos1> ^ exactly
[22:04:40] <Tobsn> i did that before, you literally feed it the string of the address and it geocodes it
[22:04:54] <Fernandos1> it's still nice $1.2k
[22:05:26] <Tobsn> 1.2k?
[22:05:32] <Fernandos1> yeah
[22:05:35] <Tobsn> for what?
[22:06:12] <Fernandos1> for the ui to enter addresses that geocode to pin markers and a filterable/searchable list
[22:06:29] <Tobsn> you get that payed or you have to pay that? i dont follow hehe
[22:06:38] <Fernandos1> get payed
[22:06:50] <Tobsn> oh yeah
[22:06:51] <Tobsn> thats nice
[22:07:02] <Fernandos1> what is it that you work on?
[22:07:15] <Tobsn> the numbers or the geo code?
[22:07:28] <Tobsn> the numbers are for a facebook ads api, the geo coding is for an iphone app
[22:07:28] <Tobsn> :)
[22:07:29] <Fernandos1> you asked about yelp and 4sq
[22:07:46] <Fernandos1> ah, sounds cool
[22:08:17] <Tobsn> yeah one will make an endless amount of money + got me funding, again... and the iphone thing is just for fun and to piss off kevin rose.
[22:08:18] <Tobsn> :)
[22:09:08] <Fernandos1> hehe did he decline to fund you?
[22:09:21] <Tobsn> nah i just dont like him and he stole my idea
[22:09:29] <Tobsn> so i try to hurry to outsmart him
[22:09:46] <Tobsn> maybe shouldve not said that in a public channel that gets logged...
[22:10:01] <Tobsn> i guess.... hello techcrunch!
[22:10:03] <Tobsn> hehe.
[22:10:11] <Fernandos1> indeed
[22:10:34] <Fernandos1> but it's not wrong to outsmart, it's wrong to outsmart just to outsmart though
[22:10:42] <Tobsn> hehe
[22:10:43] <Tobsn> well
[22:11:10] <Tobsn> if you have the chance to show them that you dont need $10m in funding to create the same product... you just do it because you can
[22:11:27] <Fernandos1> Angels invest because it's less risky to spend a mln on devs than on some stocks
[22:11:56] <Fernandos1> Tobsn: are you running on nginx?
[22:12:02] <Tobsn> lighttpd & node.js
[22:12:12] <Tobsn> lighttpd because you can find my name in the lighttpd code ;)
[22:12:17] <Fernandos1> good choice. nginx is slower than lightty
[22:12:30] <Tobsn> lighttpd v2 is actually pretty neat
[22:12:35] <Tobsn> i have it running on some dev nodes
[22:12:41] <Tobsn> performs pretty well
[22:12:41] <Fernandos1> have done benchmarks and another guy and many other independent have done the same
[22:13:11] <Fernandos1> lighty has it's weaks somewhere else though, you'll soon find it out ;)
[22:13:16] <jrockjiggz> would anyone know why stacking getScript stops working in the callback? http://jsfiddle.net/NV7Hh/
[22:13:24] <Tobsn> http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd2
[22:13:25] <Tobsn> ;)
[22:13:39] <Tobsn> next time you want to compile lighttpd, take v2
[22:13:42] <Fernandos1> hahah ;)
[22:13:56] <Fernandos1> you know weighttpd?
[22:14:03] <Tobsn> http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd (see members list ;) )
[22:14:07] <jrockjiggz> ahh i figured it out.... lol
[22:14:23] <Tobsn> weighttpd?
[22:14:24] <Fernandos1> haha fun :P
[22:14:33] <Fernandos1> yeah
[22:14:41] <Fernandos1> you def. know it then
[22:14:56] <Tobsn> dont think so
[22:15:59] <Fernandos1> http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/weighttp/wiki
[22:16:04] <Fernandos1> I misspelled it
[22:16:29] <Tobsn> oh haha
[22:16:31] <Tobsn> yeah
[22:17:45] <Tobsn> btw. if you want to test stuff
[22:17:55] <Tobsn> i started using this last week and just run some tests with it
[22:17:55] <Tobsn> http://zombie.labnotes.org/
[22:18:00] <Tobsn> fucking awesome tool.
[22:18:01] <Fernandos1> you can reach 26 rps with nginx easily and I guess about 30rps with lighty
[22:18:12] <falieson> can someone help me fix this javascript? the one i'm doing it is stupid... http://jsfiddle.net/falieson/875Ek/
[22:18:40] <Fernandos1> hahaha headless browser :D thanks for the link Tobsn
[22:18:57] <Tobsn> node.js will take over so fast
[22:19:04] <Tobsn> when people start realizing how useful and quick it is
[22:19:26] <Fernandos1> I usually write php and c, so I currently use a c app server
[22:19:40] <Fernandos1> not in production yet though
[22:19:51] <Tobsn> i used windows for 15 years and switched to mac 2 years ago and will never go back... i used php for 11 years  now and started using mongodb and node.js for about a year and will never switch back to mysql/php
[22:20:40] <ajpiano> when did you go black?
[22:20:53] <Tobsn> black?
[22:20:57] <ajpiano> yeah
[22:20:59] <ajpiano> once you go black
[22:21:01] <ajpiano> you never go back
[22:21:03] <Tobsn> why black?
[22:21:11] <coldhead> by god that's offensive
[22:21:22] <ajpiano> ?ud once you go black
[22:21:26] <bot-t> ajpiano, black and forth - when a non-black man/woman goes from dating a black man/woman back to a dating a non-black man/woman...debunks the saying "once you go black you don't go back"
[22:21:39] <Tobsn> nah i stay with the superior race
[22:21:40] <Tobsn> :P
[22:21:41] <Fernandos1> hahah oh man
[22:21:52] <ajpiano> the best jokes are those not gotten
[22:22:01] <Tobsn> im a blond, blue eyed, pale skinned german...
[22:22:08] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/falieson/875Ek/ so my function properly resizes in chrome but of course firefox doesn't work
[22:22:22] <Fernandos1> Tobsn: so you're freaking early there, I'm from DE too
[22:22:26] <Tobsn> living in california...
[22:22:33] <Tobsn> yeah its 22:22 here ;)
[22:22:33] <Fernandos1> haha ok..
[22:22:41] <Fernandos1> it's 7 in the morning here
[22:22:46] <falieson> yay claifornia
[22:22:46] <Tobsn> yeah fucking 9 hours
[22:23:00] <Tobsn> thats why i havent been back to munich in almost 2 years
[22:23:04] <Tobsn> fucking 13 hours flight
[22:23:04] <Tobsn> fml
[22:23:16] <Fernandos1> it all happened a lot quicker for me. I think I tried the whole stuff in  distrowatch
[22:23:33] <Fernandos1> am with backbox linux atm
[22:24:02] <Tobsn> ha
[22:24:08] <Tobsn> i just bought a mac mini
[22:24:11] * Fernandos1 < /dev/coffee
[22:24:12] <Tobsn> and was hooked
[22:25:06] <Fernandos1> I heard you get about 1GB/s with an ssd. but it's worthless if you have a weak CPU and NIC.. at least if you plan to run a highperf server...what else use a computer for?
[22:25:36] <Tobsn> i think a standard bus only supports up to 800mb/sec
[22:26:11] <Tobsn> in my old company in chicago one of their IT guys built a server with 24 SSD drives to scrape data from facebook
[22:26:43] <Tobsn> but he used a shitty motherboard so i kept telling him that this whole raid 24 ssd shit will get him nowhere when his BUS doesnt support a higher throughput and he puts that box on a 100mbit line...
[22:26:47] <Tobsn> was like talking to a wall
[22:27:11] <falieson> please! http://jsfiddle.net/falieson/875Ek/
[22:27:22] <Tobsn> falieson, i looked at it, whats the issue?
[22:27:38] <Fernandos1> true true. it's always SPF -- Single Point of Failure
[22:27:46] <falieson> resizeFrame4 is not defined                jQuery.event.add(window, "load", resizeFrame4);  resizeFrame2 is not defined                jQuery.event.add(window, "load", resizeFrame2);
[22:27:48] <falieson> in firefox
[22:28:09] <Tobsn> because you define before the functions exists i guess
[22:28:11] <falieson> but seriously its so awefully written, it should only be like 10 lines
[22:28:13] <Tobsn> js is still a script language
[22:28:58] <Tobsn> falieson, bind( 'load resize', function(){})
[22:29:05] <Tobsn> instead of event add and a separate function
[22:29:45] <Fernandos1> Tobsn: Do you write in C also?
[22:29:54] <Tobsn> if i have to
[22:29:56] <Tobsn> but i dont like it
[22:30:00] <Tobsn> im not very experienced with it
[22:30:33] <Fernandos1> ah yeah I had the same feeling when I started, but then I really liked it's purity

[22:37:02] <Tobsn> i worked in chicago, worked for google for half a year, quit and started helping out friends, since then i own shares of a bunch of companies i helped to get started
[22:37:17] <Tobsn> naja wir haben investoren aber das is alles privat
[22:37:46] <Fernandos1> klaro
[22:37:58] <Tobsn> keine großen investoren

[22:41:04] <Tobsn> die kultur is halt anders, hier wird geld investiert um vor verlust zu schützen, in europa wird geld gespart und weggepackt
[22:41:07] <Fernandos1> dafür ist die Weltkarte
[22:41:40] <Tobsn> ich hab halt das problem das deutsche zu klein denken
[22:41:46] <Tobsn> die machen nen startup und begrenzen es auf deutschland
[22:42:38] <Tobsn> sowas geht nur in amerika
[22:42:42] <Tobsn> oder china
