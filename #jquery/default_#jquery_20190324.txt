[00:54:40] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass the entire url for the link
[00:54:44] <robertmaxrees> with the protocol
[00:54:45] <nate> by specifying a protocol
[00:55:00] <jak2000> http://www.google.com
[00:55:01] <jak2000> ?
[00:55:04] <robertmaxrees> yes
[00:55:08] <jak2000> checking
[00:56:18] <jak2000> ok, done thanks
[00:56:33] <robertmaxrees> also: don't shotgun questions out to multiple channels at once ;)
[01:00:14] <jak2000> ok
[01:16:20] <Coolternet> anyone can tell me how is named ? https://fkcd.ca/9UW
[01:16:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:17:10] <Coolternet> im trying to make a code with country and state selector
[01:17:19] <Coolternet> but im not able to convert objet to string
[01:17:32] <robertmaxrees> show what you've tried
[01:17:43] <robertmaxrees> in a jsfiddle.
[01:17:53] <Coolternet> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xBMLeY?editors=1111
[01:18:30] <robertmaxrees> erm
[01:18:54] <Coolternet> its my first time im using JQ normaly im working on PHP
[01:19:12] <robertmaxrees> so what line there are you having issues with?
[01:20:02] <Coolternet> i know var country is good cause i need data-type value
[01:20:39] <Coolternet> but i need to set the state selector with the country data for appen all row
[01:20:50] <Coolternet> sorry my english is not very good :s
[01:21:05] <robertmaxrees> so first off
[01:21:16] <robertmaxrees> your data structure is really weird.
[01:21:46] <robertmaxrees> secondly, is it that you're trying to select the country within the "state" var?
[01:22:33] <robertmaxrees> trying to understand where you confusion is
[01:22:38] <Coolternet> nop
[01:23:06] <Coolternet> im select the country and the state selector show all state of the country selecting
[01:23:33] <robertmaxrees> is it that the append isn't working?
[01:24:16] <Coolternet> nop
[01:24:21] <robertmaxrees> then what's the issue? lol
[01:24:38] <robertmaxrees> is it that the state.forEach isn't working?
[01:26:09] <Coolternet> idk what is wrong ... i wasted all my day for that .. i really need this and im not able to make work it
[01:26:40] <robertmaxrees> you realize forEach only works for arrays, right?
[01:26:46] <robertmaxrees> and you don't have arrays in that object.
[01:27:06] <Coolternet> i know nothing on jquery
[01:27:11] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a jquery thing
[01:27:15] <robertmaxrees> it's a javascript thing :)
[01:27:22] <Coolternet> lol same thing lol
[01:27:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[01:27:31] <robertmaxrees> not the same thing at all heh
[01:27:38] <Coolternet> i know only html / css / php / sql
[01:27:42] <Coolternet> nothing more
[01:27:49] <robertmaxrees> so i'd start by fixing the data.
[01:27:58] <robertmaxrees> because that's your first issue.
[01:28:08] <Coolternet> okay
[01:28:30] <robertmaxrees> the CA and US objects should be arrays instead.
[01:29:03] <Coolternet> so i have 4762 line to editing
[01:29:25] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[01:29:42] <robertmaxrees> your daya, as formatted, isn't practical for what you want to do.
[01:30:22] <Coolternet> ok
[01:30:45] <Coolternet> What can i do for fix it ?
[01:31:23] <robertmaxrees> like i just said -  you want cs and us to be arrays
[01:31:23] <robertmaxrees> [2019:03:23:22:30:49] * Anthaas (~Anthaas@unaffiliated/anthaas) Quit (Ping ti
[01:31:25] <robertmaxrees> woops
[01:31:32] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/e7e980af078e
[01:31:35] <robertmaxrees> ^ like this
[01:32:33] <robertmaxrees> second, you're editing the dropdown, but that's not going to actually work like that because you're using semantic.
[01:32:34] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/1761
[01:33:24] <Coolternet> ho damn i have some result now !
[01:33:46] <robertmaxrees> you were using forEach on an object, but that's an array method, not for object.
[01:34:11] <Coolternet> ok
[02:33:54] <Coolternet> robertmaxrees: i just done it and it work perfectly with semantic
[02:34:04] <robertmaxrees> k
[02:34:17] <Coolternet> and im crying now cause around 14h wasted for that and now its work
[02:34:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[02:46:05] <Coolternet> i have a little issue.. when im selecting CA ... and im changing for US... i see CA state's into the list
[02:46:28] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your current code i have no way to help :)
[02:47:58] <Coolternet> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xBMLeY?editors=0011
[02:48:21] <robertmaxrees> so think about it
[02:48:30] <robertmaxrees> $("#state").append - you only ever append.
[02:50:16] <Coolternet> yeah
[02:50:18] <robertmaxrees> you need to empty the element first.
[02:50:29] <Coolternet> its why im looking for remove all item before append
[02:50:34] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[02:50:46] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/empty/
[02:50:50] <robertmaxrees> just use this
[02:51:35] <robertmaxrees> $("#demo").detach(); wat
[02:52:16] <Coolternet> he .detach() method is the same as .remove(), except that .detach() keeps all jQuery data associated with the removed elements. This method is useful when removed elements are to be reinserted into the DOM at a later time.
[02:52:31] <robertmaxrees> i know what it does
[02:52:34] <robertmaxrees> but why are you using it?
[02:52:44] <Coolternet> it was a try
[02:53:26] <robertmaxrees> use $("#demo").empty() instead.
[02:53:39] <Coolternet> ok i found my issue
[02:53:46] <robertmaxrees> ...
[02:53:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:54:10] <Coolternet> yeah it was empty but i need to put out of the append {}
[02:54:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[02:54:53] <robertmaxrees> also a couple other notes -
[02:55:07] <robertmaxrees> why is that massive object in the click handler?
[02:55:21] <robertmaxrees> and why did you swap to $.each instead of the native forEach you were using?
[02:56:39] <Coolternet> cause i see it on stack overflow some example with only each
[02:56:52] <Coolternet> var state ?
[02:57:02] <robertmaxrees> just use forEach
[02:57:09] <Coolternet> its all state of USA and CANADA
[02:57:20] <robertmaxrees> why is it inside your click handler though?
[02:58:37] <Coolternet> that was my next question xD if i really need to put in the handler
[02:58:53] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[02:58:58] <robertmaxrees> let me clean this up a little.
[03:00:55] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/OqdzRB?editors=0011
[03:02:14] <Coolternet> wthek ..
[03:02:19] <Coolternet> what is map ?
[03:02:32] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[03:02:49] <robertmaxrees> lets you transform an array from one format to another
[03:02:59] <Coolternet> ho
[03:03:04] <robertmaxrees> it's nice because this way you only touch the DOM once for the append.
[03:11:24] <Coolternet> soo i need to keep it on the handler ?
[03:11:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[03:11:44] <Coolternet> all states
[03:11:53] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[03:12:04] <Coolternet> i need to keep in the handler ?
[03:12:13] <robertmaxrees> why?
[03:12:19] <Coolternet> its a question lol
[03:12:21] <robertmaxrees> your question doesn't make sense.
[03:12:30] <Coolternet> sorry i will use google translate
[03:14:05] <Coolternet> Am I obliged to keep the list of states inside the button or can I put it in another file and call this file?
[03:14:50] <robertmaxrees> ah - so long as the var is in a shared scope, you can put it in another file.
[03:15:04] <Coolternet> okay nice !
[03:15:15] <Coolternet> cause i have 4700 line to add -_-
[03:15:24] <robertmaxrees> erm
[03:15:42] <robertmaxrees> i woulnd't store that in a js file.
[03:15:49] <robertmaxrees> make an api endpoint and call that instead.
[03:16:00] <Coolternet> omg its too complicated for me
[03:16:08] <robertmaxrees> that's really not that complicated.
[03:16:20] <robertmaxrees> and 4700 lines of data in the browser is a bad idea.
[03:18:00] <Coolternet> REST API ?
[03:18:22] <robertmaxrees> doesn't need to be anything complicated.
[03:18:45] <robertmaxrees> do a get with a countryCode= query string param and return the array you want.
[03:38:25] <Coolternet> thx for your help :D
[09:59:17] <Coolternet> how can i use URL in $.get ? i know its  $.get('file_name.ext', function(contents) { $("#contentArea").val(contents); },'text'); but i need to get a VAR into url like ('var.ext', function(content){})
[10:01:43] <Coolternet> i've try to use $.get('url'+ var +'.ext', function(){}) but it doesn't work
[10:52:25] <tamilan> The tamil month translation is incorrect in datepicker.

[10:52:25] <tamilan> The tamil month translation is incorrect in datepicker.
[14:41:39] <aro> when using .sortable(), is there a definition list somewhere that details when to use ui.helper or ui.item?
[15:01:55] <ws2k3> http://51.77.221.183:3001/#!/dashboard .!/dashboard it seems there is an issue with angularjs + jquery. Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .!/dashboard im a but new to jquery and javascript. how can i debug this? cause the jquery is a minified so its hard so find it there
