[00:01:44] <AlexWaters> so I'm watching a tutorial, and the guy has this as the example code: http://jsfiddle.net/R9RQS/
[00:01:59] <AlexWaters> shouldn't there be a closing </ul> ?
[00:02:25] <AlexWaters> i've seen him do this elsewhere, and am wondering if jquery does some magic where it doesn't need a closing tag on certain elements
[00:04:11] <AlexWaters> but when I look at the page in the inspector, lo and behold a </ul> is there
[00:04:41] <tw2113> browsers and the DOM can be weird
[00:05:04] <tw2113> you don't even need the closing </li> as long as the following tag is a new <li>
[00:05:28] <AlexWaters> tw2113: that's going to make me insane...
[00:05:48] <coldhead> the browser does the best it can with your broken markup
[00:05:57] <AlexWaters> coldhead: ok that makes sense
[00:06:11] <tw2113> also if you're going to have anything after the list, looks like you'll need to close it
[00:06:15] <coldhead> it's better not to break it
[00:06:23] <tw2113> otherwise something like a paragraph will be interpreted as part of the li
[00:06:25] <coldhead> just do the right thing and no one gets hurt
[00:06:25] <AlexWaters> i hope that it's just a bad example
[00:06:58] <tw2113> if you're that worried, just close your tags yourself
[00:07:21] <tw2113> best to be sure or something
[00:07:28] <AlexWaters> i was just surprised by it. it's not a free tutorial, so I was expecting quality code
[00:07:48] <tw2113> and it may not be still
[00:07:56] <tw2113> technically you don't even need the <head> tag
[00:08:56] <AlexWaters> i just tried: var oList = $("<ul id='bookmarksList' />");
[00:09:00] <AlexWaters> which makes even less sense
[00:09:04] <AlexWaters> but ok
[00:09:45] <tw2113> *takes out the body tag*
[00:11:11] <tw2113> oops, according to the w3.org site, the start and end tag for ul/ol is required
[00:11:25] <AlexWaters> tw2113: so ^ closes the body tag, but I don't see it because the browser corrects it? sounds like this is going to be hard to debug
[00:11:31] <tw2113> but for li, optional at the end
[00:14:13] <Chuguniy> Could someone give a link to a tutorial, book, article etc. with a very clean and transparent explanation how to write an asyncronous code, for dummies? About how things are working in background and how is code being executed. Thank you.
[00:15:02] <tw2113> AlexWaters, http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.5.1
[00:15:16] <tw2113> "Start tag: optional, End tag: optional"
[00:15:45] <AlexWaters> tw2113: ah, interesting. I had no idea
[00:16:06] <tw2113> you could probably, and by probably i mean 99% likely, learn a lot from reading the spec itself
[00:16:21] <tw2113> and this is a link for html 4.0.1 spec :D
[00:16:30] <tw2113> so this has been true for a decade
[00:17:30] <AlexWaters> tw2113: i'll do that. a lot of this tutorial is going over my head.
[00:17:32] <tw2113> head tag is optional on both ends
[00:17:40] <tw2113> title tag is required
[00:17:54] <tw2113> html tag is optional
[00:20:52] <tw2113> kudos if you find tags/info that you didn't know about but could use
[00:22:48] <AlexWaters> the address tag is required? I don't think I've ever used that
[00:23:18] <AlexWaters> oh haha, wow
[00:23:38] <AlexWaters> i just realized that required is only if you're constructing the element. not that it's a required part of the document
[00:25:13] <granden> This hover effect that in2media.dk have on there small pictures on the first page. (In Chrome/Safari and latest Firefox) is it CSS3 or javascript/jquery?
[00:26:01] <tw2113> granden, the slider at the top?
[00:26:33] <tw2113> nothing on hover is standing out to me
[00:27:03] <granden> hmm
[00:27:06] <granden> no not the slider
[00:27:10] <granden> the small images bellow that one.
[00:27:29] <tw2113> like the one that syas "selected" or "yousee" ?
[00:27:30] <granden> They did some sort of diagonal cut on the images
[00:27:47] <granden> tw2113: The one that says "TOP DANMARK LANCE"
[00:27:48] <tw2113> ah the arrow pointing up
[00:27:51] <granden> the image obow that
[00:28:01] <coldhead> Chuguniy: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/ajax-deferreds
[00:28:07] <granden> tw2113: Which browser?
[00:28:15] <tw2113> firefox aurora
[00:28:42] <tw2113> so version 17 at the moment
[00:29:04] <Chuguniy> coldhead: Thank you! Will dive into knowledge :)
[00:29:46] <tw2113> ah i see it now
[00:29:50] <granden> Ah :)
[00:29:54] <tw2113> sadly, i had to start chrome
[00:29:56] <tw2113> bastards
[00:30:03] <granden> Ah :(
[00:30:10] <granden> Yeah, probably some CSS3 animations then.
[00:33:53] <tw2113> i'd be a bit surprised
[00:37:53] <tw2113> my guess is this http://in2media.com/includes/js/plugins/gridbox.js
[00:38:03] <tw2113> based on class added to the images affected
[00:41:30] <tw2113> also looks like an in-house thing
[00:42:16] <tw2113> granden
[00:44:31] <granden> tw2113: Ok, something they did themself? Doh probably wont be to happy if I use it then. :)
[00:44:54] <tw2113> see if you can get ahold of them and ask
[00:48:53] <granden> tw2113: Will have to do that. First trying to implement it :)
[00:49:08] <granden> then ask If it is ok to use it in that way I guess.
[00:49:22] <tw2113> copy/paste/trial/error
[01:04:22] <granden> tw2113: Thanks for everything.
[01:04:58] <tw2113> you'll learn to disect in time
[01:39:50] <saedelaere> i have created a popup with jquery. Now I want to display data in this popup that i load via ajax. My question is there any best practice on how to work with dynamic content and jQuery/Javascript? I think I will create the whole Layout and just fill in the content where I need it. Or is there any smarter way?
[01:39:58] <t432> hello room, why i', i getting a silent error on this line? - http://pastebin.com/czeNEZD0
[01:40:05] <t432> i'm*

[01:41:03] <t432> to be clear, i mean content of a byte[]
[01:43:44] <Chuguniy> If to put ajax async to false inside a function, will it turn off async globaly or localy?
[01:47:58] <t432> anyone?

[05:12:57] <w32stuxnet> hi all, if I have a number of animations occurring in an each() function, is it possible to make something wait until they have all finished before continuing?

[05:20:34] <Spike_Manana> I got this function http://pastebin.com/ehCLWWX6 and it works partly, it outputs 1-st value of the array and firebug has this message: "Element referenced by ID/NAME in the global scope. Use W3C standard document.getElementById() instead.
[05:20:34] <Spike_Manana> $(tempContainer).load(resource[i], function() {".
[05:21:49] <Spike_Manana> Could someone tell me what am I doing wrong here?
[05:26:28] <t432> here is the entire method, problem is in line 23-29 (silent error) http://pastebin.com/TY5dc434
[05:26:37] <t432> if i commend out those lines, it seems to work
[05:27:36] <t432> wasted too much time on things, i'm sure its trivial
[05:27:41] <t432> on this*
[05:43:58] <xorox90_> anybody know why it don't alert source code? I tried it 2hours..... ==> $.post('http://61.43.139.70:8000', JSON.stringify({jsonrpc:'2.0', method:'recent_twitter', params:{}, id:1}), function (data) {alert("WW"); }, 'json');
[05:44:43] <xorox90_> In packet sniff, it success and result comes well, but it doesn't print "WW"...

[05:57:17] <diverdude> anybody knows a very nice thumbnail scroller which is capable of showing thumbnails with a title?
[05:57:22] <arch_adam> i have jquery tabs, and 2 different forms in each tab. when i submit the form i send the url to a hash based url, so i can then do a check against the url to trigger the click on that tab to remember what tab the user was on
[05:58:00] <arch_adam> but when i do this , switching between tabs do not work
[05:58:16] <arch_adam> its not showing and hiding the panels as default
[05:58:19] <arch_adam> any ideas?
[06:09:18] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[06:14:41] <diverdude> anybody knows a very nice thumbnail scroller which is capable of showing thumbnails with a title?
[06:15:17] <ruby_on_tails> diverdude: you mean show text on an image on hover ?
[06:16:31] <diverdude> ruby_on_tails: yeah
[06:16:53] <ruby_on_tails> diverdude: you could code that easily, no need of a plugin or something
[06:17:27] <diverdude> ruby_on_tails: i need something very much like this one: http://mysitemyway.com/support/topic/nivo-slider-thumbnail-image-navigation
[06:17:32] <diverdude> ruby_on_tails: in the bottom
[06:18:33] <ruby_on_tails> diverdude: add a absolutely positioned image with 100% height and width and overlay it above the imag
[06:18:38] <ruby_on_tails> too tired to write the code
[06:18:40] <ruby_on_tails> sorry
[06:19:32] <diverdude> ruby_on_tails: hehe its not easy as that...before you know it a slider like that is more than 100 lines of code
[06:19:42] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[06:20:19] <diverdude> ruby_on_tails: and needs to be cross browser also and such....its way more than just adding an absolutely positioned image
[06:20:41] <ruby_on_tails> absolutely positioned div*
[06:21:43] <diverdude> responsive also takes code
[06:22:02] <diverdude> all in all...no its not just  "add a absolutely positioned image with 100% height and width and overlay it above the imag"
[06:47:03] <Spike_Manana> Why firebug keeps teling me "TypeError: preloadResourceContent(data) is undefined" in this http://pastebin.com/FxCBxAZP function? Thank you.
[07:20:21] <Stava> Could you recommend me a modal/lightbox plugin for responsive websites? I have no need for galleries, carousels, ajax or such extra functionality
[07:35:23] <t432> I have several ajax calls in a function, e.g. load:$.ajax..., loadTwo: $.ajax... etc... is there a way to get a reference to which one of those calls in throw the error in the error function?

[09:00:52] <bouzu> hi
[09:01:21] <bouzu> any one talk frenhc here?
[09:01:23] <bouzu> french*
[09:03:48] <firstclassfunc> no, french is out
[09:04:17] <bouzu> ok i'll try in english then
[09:04:37] <bouzu> how i can apply event on ajax response ?
[09:05:32] <bouzu> i need to do onclick on something where this thing is comming from ajax loading in a div
[09:05:55] <bouzu> it is possible ?
[09:51:29] <scar> so im using nivo, and im trying directionNavHide:false, but it still hides the direction nav. i want the direction nav to be placed outside of the actual slideshow too-- is there a way to use a different directional nav other than the one auto generated?
[09:52:16] <ak> scar: it is, just make some new css..
[09:53:02] <scar> ak: it is what? i have the nav styled out, etc, but i cannot get it to show outside the slide div bc the slide div is fixed width and height-- so id like to put the direction nav outside and use jquery to control it, but the docs were confusing
[09:53:38] <ak> ah
[09:53:56] <ak> wait...
[09:53:58] <scar> i mean, i cant even get directionNavHide:false to work #1, but that wont even matter bc i need it outside the nivo slideshow
[09:54:47] <scar> like an onclick of a different a#prev or something to nextSlide... let me see maybe thats what i have to do haha
[09:56:28] <ak> scar: http://nivo.dev7studios.com/support/jquery-plugin-usage/
[09:56:47] <ak> i don't see any directionNavHide thing here..
[09:57:16] <ak> only directrionNav
[09:57:18] <ak> -r
[09:57:29] <ak> that could be a problem
[09:58:38] <ak> hm it's sad, that nive slider doesn't have some option, to trigger some event for it...
[09:59:11] <scar> ak: ahh, well i was looking at other results beyond that. im looking at this part too:http://nivogallery.dev7studios.com/documentation/functions/
[09:59:17] <bouzu> re
[09:59:25] <scar> but im unsure of $('#gallery').nivoGallery();
[09:59:38] <bouzu> how i can apply a plugin on a div where this div is from ajax ?
[09:59:53] <scar> but nivo is called $('#slider').nivoSlider()
[10:00:01] <bouzu> its not loaded in the DOM by default
[10:00:09] <scar> so do i do $('#slider).play() ?
[10:00:09] <scar> lol
[10:00:35] <ak> scar: if you want a basic slider, you should look only at the doc...
[10:01:41] <bouzu> plz ?
[10:01:43] <ak> scar: if you use this nivogallery, you could use this with your divs:
[10:01:44] <ak>  $('#gallery').data('nivoGallery').nextSlide();
[10:02:14] <ak> like $('#myNextButton').on('click', function() { $('#gallery').data('nivoGallery').nextSlide(); });
[10:02:59] <ak> but i think this could just crash ie at some point :)
[10:03:38] <scar> any IE?
[10:04:14] <scar> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'nextSlide' of undefined
[10:05:21] <ak> ?demo @ scar
[10:05:22] <bot-t> scar, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:05:29] <ak> ;)
[10:05:50] <scar> http://ulg.alomedia.net/portfolio/invitations/
[10:06:06] <scar> ak: maybe i can simply trigger another trigger lol and css to hide the default control heh
[10:06:14] <scar> s/directionnav/control
[10:06:21] <scar> oops
[10:06:41] <gpbmike> you guys like jsfiddle better than jsbin?
[10:07:26] <ak> jsfiddle works very well for me
[10:08:25] <ak> scar: you have here the nivoslider, but this thing we wrote only works with nivogallery, what i think is some different thing...
[10:08:41] <ak> or i dunno...
[10:10:15] <scar> how can i have an onclick a #foo to trigger as if it was clicking #bar ?
[10:11:03] <scar> nevermind i got it
[10:11:04] <scar> haha =D
[10:11:05] <scar> refresh
[10:16:12] <newcode> anybody knows a good viewport events library?
[10:16:20] <newcode> on github?
[10:16:36] <scar> anyone know of a good multi row multi column carousel jquery slider? heh
[10:23:32] <tash> how do you iterate through an object in jquery/js ?
[10:24:22] <tash> kind of like this in php: foreach ( $array as $key => $value ) {  // do stuff }
[10:24:55] <tash> I"m using DataTables and need to get the value of something inside an object and don't really know how.
[10:32:44] <beachandbytes> tash
[10:33:13] <tash> yeah?
[10:33:13] <beachandbytes> $(object).each(function () { alert($(this).myproperty); });
[10:33:13] <tash> lol
[10:35:37] <diverdude> Hello. Can anybody help me understand why only 1 image is being shown here: http://jsfiddle.net/SRwSg/3/ even though i have specified 3 images to be shown?
[10:35:41] <tash> beachandbytes: thanks ... trying that. Not working so it probably is me doing it wrong.  Or I didn't explain the issue very well.
[10:36:29] <tash> beachandbytes: I posted this in a forum, shows what I'm after.  Can you help me with that? http://www.datatables.net/forums/discussion/11655/how-to-hook-response-received-event-of-data-tables-ssp-added-item-to-json-encoded-array#Item_4
[10:36:58] <beachandbytes> $.each(object,function (name,value) { alert(name+ ':' + value);});
[10:37:08] <beachandbytes> if your trying to iterate over the objects properties and not object array
[10:37:41] <diverdude> beachandbytes: hi
[10:37:50] <tash> I did a console.log ( oSettings ); and it returns an object. I'm looking at it in firebug.
[10:38:04] <tash> within the object is another object called jqXHR
[10:38:45] <tash> and within jqXHR is a json_encode'd array called responseText... I want to get the values of things in there.
[10:38:58] <beachandbytes> hi diverdude im looking
[10:39:17] <tash> specifically "iTotalHours":"133.5" ( I want the 133.5 )...I am not sure if I've given you enough info to really help, just talking out loud.
[10:39:18] <diverdude> beachandbytes: oh thank you so much :)
[10:39:59] <Alx433> Hello everyone. I'm trying to do a tiny list timer iterator using jquery Timer, but it's ackwardly working different in different browsers. I've pasted the code in jsfiddle, just can't find how to include the jquery.timer.js in it
[10:40:06] <Alx433> to show you
[10:40:29] <beachandbytes> var x = $.parseJson(jqXHR); alert(x.iTotalHours);
[10:40:46] <beachandbytes> so parse json string to object, and use objects property
[10:41:49] <Alx433> I guess I totally misexpalined myself. What I'm really trying to do is to get a html list and display one item of the list a time
[10:42:32] <Alx433> after the last list item, start it again
[10:42:54] <tash> beachandbytes: what do I need to do before the var x = ?  b/c if I do that without anything before it, just get jqXHR is not defined
[10:43:12] <beachandbytes> sorry meant
[10:43:24] <beachandbytes> var x  = $.parseJson(oSettings);
[10:44:22] <tash> errors: parseJson is not a function
[10:44:40] <tash> var x = $.parseJson(oSettings); alert(x.iTotalHours);
[10:46:44] <HAPPYFUNBRO> anyone in here familiar with waypoints? if so, how well does it perform?
[10:48:14] <tash> beachandbytes: oSettings isn't json, it's an object ... responseText within oSettings->jqXHR is json though
[10:49:33] <HAPPYFUNBRO> actually how would one install a jquery plugin?
[10:50:32] <beachandbytes> okay will then jsonparse the response object
[10:50:41] <beachandbytes> just include the script in your page HAPPYFUNBRO
[10:51:13] <tash> beachandbytes: makes sense ... did you already tell me how to get to that object?
[10:51:18] <tash> i'll scroll up to see
[10:51:37] <lilleman> function(){var a = 'b';} function(){ // Want to access a} <-- is this possible?
[10:52:10] <diverdude> beachandbytes: did you have any luck?
[10:52:11] <myrman> lilleman, give the first function a name, and return the a variable, then call the first function
[10:53:02] <lilleman> myrman: sorry, I simplified to much. Let me try again :)
[10:53:11] <beachandbytes> diverdude,  its your html structure
[10:53:26] <diverdude> beachandbytes: oh really? what is the problem?
[10:53:35] <beachandbytes> the extra <a href> within the li
[10:53:42] <beachandbytes> plugin is looking for first level elements
[10:54:56] <diverdude> beachandbytes: but i need a link and a title for each element
[10:55:06] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/SRwSg/39/
[10:55:07] <lilleman> http://pastebin.com/eUZHHNLj
[10:55:07] <myrman> lilleman: function a() { var a = 'b'; return a; } function c() { var c = a(); }
[10:55:09] <tash> hey beachandbytes: $( oSettings ).each( function() { console.log( $(this) ) }); logs the parent object in firebug.  if there is a child object called jqXHR, how could I log that in firebug?
[10:55:18] <tash> just taking baby steps so I understand and learn what I'm doing.
[10:55:34] <lilleman> myrman: There is my actual problem. Cant really translate the solution you're giving to that
[10:55:37] <beachandbytes> tash
[10:55:43] <beachandbytes> oSettings.jqXHR
[10:55:52] <beachandbytes> object.property
[10:55:55] <myrman> lilleman?
[10:56:38] <lilleman> myrman: My paste http://pastebin.com/eUZHHNLj shows my real problem. Trying to cancel a timer on a menu hiding
[10:57:08] <myrman> I can't help you there. I only answered your question.
[10:57:20] <tash> beachandbytes: so, instead of the .each, could I just do: console.log ( oSettings.jqXHR ); ?
[10:57:38] <lilleman> myrman: Yeah, thanks. :) My question was over simplified
[10:58:24] <tash> beachandbytes: just tried and that work ... now I want to log responseText within the jqXHR object.
[10:58:24] <lilleman> So, I want to cancel the timer I created when hovering the menu option: http://pastebin.com/rdPd4Crq
[10:58:45] <diverdude> beachandbytes: yeah thats not a problem to make it work like that. but i need the li and a elements
[10:59:09] <diverdude> beachandbytes: li because i need to wrap a title as well and a because i need each image to be clickable
[11:00:41] <beachandbytes> tash oSettings.jqHR.responseText
[11:01:02] <Spike_Manana> Can't get the value for resourceContent in the function http://pastebin.com/AneCsurp could someone help please?
[11:01:13] <beachandbytes> diverdude, not sure if the plugin supports it
[11:01:18] <beachandbytes> ill look at options in sec
[11:01:30] <lilleman> It was a stupid typo >_<
[11:02:49] <tash> beachandbytes: dang, says undefined
[11:02:50] <tash> hmm
[11:04:15] <diverdude> beachandbytes: yes ok
[11:05:00] <tash> responseText looks like this...json ... so when I console.log(oSettings.jqXHR) one of the things in that object is responseText, in firebug I can click on the + sign to expand it and I see http://pastie.org/4686438
[11:08:19] <beachandbytes> var x  = $.parseJson(oSettings.jqXHR); console.log(x.iTotalHours);
[11:12:04] <tash> beachandbytes: haven't tried that yet, but iTotalHours is in oSettings->jqXHR->responseText ... so would the var x line change?
[11:13:20] <beachandbytes> tash yes parse whatever the json object is
[11:13:28] <beachandbytes> then access its properties
[11:14:24] <tash> thought this might work: var x  = $.parseJson(oSettings.jqXHR.responseText); console.log(x.iTotalHours);
[11:14:31] <tash> but get $.parseJson is not a function
[11:16:16] <beachandbytes> diverdude, http://jsfiddle.net/SRwSg/54/
[11:17:09] <beachandbytes> parseJSON
[11:17:22] <diverdude> beachandbytes: aha...so i just needed to float the items? How did you find out?
[11:18:55] <tash> sighs, x is null
[11:18:56] <tash> :(
[11:19:32] <danheberden> goddamn x
[11:19:55] <danheberden> also, tash, wat
[11:20:13] <danheberden> is that a status 200?
[11:20:17] <danheberden> or you trying to get non 200 status
[11:20:44] <danheberden> also, the method is $.parseJSON
[11:20:46] <danheberden> (case sensitive)
[11:20:50] <danheberden> (obviously)
[11:21:29] <diverdude> beachandbytes: do you know how to remove the gap between the images left by the 'a' box? http://jsfiddle.net/SRwSg/60/
[11:21:50] <danheberden> and $.ajax already supports dataType: 'json', so, like, wat
[11:23:04] <tash> danheberden: I'm trying to get the value of iTotalHours.  it lives within oSettings(object)->jqXHR(object)->responseText
[11:23:31] <danheberden> tash, my question is why you are using responseText
[11:23:40] <tash> in firebug when I console.log( oSettings.jqXHR ) it gives me an object, when I click on it, responseText has a + to expand it.
[11:23:51] <tash> I expand it and I see a json array
[11:23:54] <danheberden> instead of jqXHR.done( function( theAlreadyParsedJson ) { /* do shit */ } );
[11:24:14] <danheberden> tash, you might want to learn more about jQuery's ajax function
[11:24:22] <danheberden> so you aren't, like, overdoing a lot of extra work
[11:24:25] <beachandbytes> tash http://jsfiddle.net/F2yFR/
[11:25:32] <beachandbytes> tash http://jsfiddle.net/F2yFR/1/
[11:26:32] <tash> I see your working example.
[11:26:43] <Eviltwin> And raise you a broken one
[11:27:27] <tash> maybe responseText isn't what I say it is then.
[11:28:05] <Eviltwin> Maybe not indeed!
[11:28:17] <tash> when I console.log(oSettings.jqXHR) firebug gives me an object. I click on it and see +responseText so I click on the + to expand it and immeidately to the right I see that json, but also in the responseText I see status 200, statusText "OK" and so on.
[11:30:16] <tash> so, is responseText not actually what I thought it was?
[11:32:28] <tash> http://snag.gy/VA0EM.jpg
[11:32:49] <tash> there's a prnt scrn of it
[11:33:28] <beachandbytes> diverdude,  http://jsfiddle.net/SRwSg/69/
[11:41:54] <diverdude> beachandbytes: ahh nice. check this out :) http://jsfiddle.net/SRwSg/82/
[11:42:04] <mowol> Im using .hover() together with addClass and removeClass to show a shopping cart on hover. The shopping cart div appears close to the element with the hover applied. I would like the shopping cart to stay visible if i move the mouse into the shopping cart. I tried adding the same hover effect to the shopping cart without effect. What should i do?
[11:42:24] <beachandbytes> tash I think this might be your objects
[11:42:25] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/F2yFR/2/
[11:42:59] <beachandbytes> looks good diverdude
[11:43:27] <beachandbytes> mowol do you have example?
[11:44:07] <mowol> beachandbytes: http://lampe.roionline.dk the hover works on "indkøbskurv" in the top
[11:45:47] <Eviltwin> mowol: It's typically done this way: http://jsfiddle.net/D6xd5/
[11:46:20] <mowol> Eviltwin: simple, thanks :)
[11:57:56] <mowol> Eviltwin: now i just have to get it to work ;)
[12:25:23] <min|dvir|us> Hey, gnarf, you around?
[12:43:26] <darkfrog> I have a very strange problem and I'm hoping someone can help me figure out why this might be happening.  So, I'm sending "keydown" events to the server via AJAX sending JSON with the data from the event.  This is working fine except when I hit ESCAPE and it sends the message fine and the server receives and responds correctly, but jQuery says an error occurred sending the AJAX.  There's no useful information in the error, just says error.  I 
[12:44:04] <darkfrog> ah, that must be what's happening
[12:44:19] <darkfrog> if I prevent default then everything is fine
[12:44:25] <darkfrog> this is on an INPUT
[12:44:27] <darkfrog> very strange
[12:45:03] <darkfrog> also only happens on keydown, not keyup
[13:10:01] <mib_mib> hi guys, i want to load jquery into the developer toolbar of Google Chrome, however, when i try to use other solutions (i.e. loading a script from ajax.google.com or jquery.com it blocks the loading of those scripts) what can i do?
[13:20:12] <SmartTowel1> anyone know how i can center an image using twitter bootstrap that has a jTag plugin on it? Ex. $('#img1).tag({...options...});
[13:20:36] <SmartTowel1> i want to be able to center #img1, but the plugin seems to be floating it left somewhere.
[13:21:00] <min|dvir|us> SmartTowel1: is there any reason you're not using CSS to center?
[13:21:29] <SmartTowel1> no. i tried the following css |
[13:21:29] <SmartTowel1> .center {
[13:21:29] <SmartTowel1>     float: none !important;
[13:21:29] <SmartTowel1>     margin: 0 auto !important;
[13:21:29] <SmartTowel1>     text-align: center !important;
[13:21:30] <SmartTowel1> }
[13:21:36] <SmartTowel1> but the plugin seems to be overridding that.
[13:22:01] <SmartTowel1> im using twitter bootstrap for this project as well.  so a solution with either or would be wonderful :)
[13:22:14] <min|dvir|us> SmartTowel1: an example page?
[13:22:34] <SmartTowel1> that .center, works, but only on images without the the plugin attached.  sure, one moment.
[13:23:14] <min|dvir|us> SmartTowel1: FYI margin: 0 auto only applies to block-level elements.
[13:23:21] <min|dvir|us> Whose width isn't 100%.
[13:23:32] <SmartTowel1> indeed.
[13:26:57] <SmartTowel1> @min, http://jsfiddle.net/FkfQc/
[13:28:36] <SmartTowel1> they're both centered now, because u would need to call the js for the jtag plugin(http://djpate.com/portfolio/jTag/)
[13:28:46] <SmartTowel1> but that's the code in a nutshell.
[13:34:34] <Absolute0> I added jquery-mobile to my site, which causes some images not to properly load until the page refreshes on ios, but works fine in the browser. What could be the issue
[13:48:57] <Afnarel_> Hi
[13:52:10] <Afnarel_> I'm using the getJSON function to create a notification system like the one on Facebook
[13:52:10] <Afnarel_> http://pastebin.com/4SFqkbeH
[13:52:33] <mib_mib> hi guys, i read that jquery .live is now deprecated in jquery 1.7 for the .on() method - i'm building a chrome extension that listens for google search results and acts on them once they exist (after a query is typed) - is the on() method the right one for the job?
[13:53:08] <Afnarel_> but I've got two problems: the first is that sometimes the notifications are marked as read in my database but not displayed
[13:53:33] <Afnarel_> And the second (most importantt to me) is that the page is reloading constantly
[13:55:13] <Afnarel_> I guess some of you have already done that before, so if you have some sample code, a good library or some idea on how to fix my code, I would appreciate a lot ;)
[13:55:15] <mib_mib> i guess my question is - how do I use the jquery on() method to listen for 'existence' of another element
[13:59:49] <diverdude> If i do a $.each loop, how can i detect which iteration is the first?
[14:10:22] <scar> when using the wp uploader on an admin page for a single textbox field for an upload, what is the best way to change the text "insert into post"?
[14:12:55] <xec> diverdude: $.each(function(i){ if (i === 0) ... })  ?
[14:20:22] <riku> can I somehow set an element active
[14:20:35] <riku> so it would use the :active definition
[14:25:06] <darkfrog> I have <div>Some <b>content</b> here</div> and I've got an event listener on mouseover on the div, but when I hover over the bolded content it doesn't consider that inclusive...how do I listen to mouseover the div and all children?
[14:25:52] <tw2113> scar, i'd wager there's a filter for that, and not necessary to use jquery
[14:29:27] <jamesaa> Is there a better way to do http://jsfiddle.net/UWVkg/ ?
[14:37:49] <xec> jamesaa: what exactly is it supposed to do
[14:38:16] <xec> toggle the text on click?
[14:38:18] <jamesaa> xec, on click do something and then when clicked again undo
[14:40:37] <xec> jamesaa: this is a start, if there's only 1 button http://jsfiddle.net/UWVkg/1/
[14:41:31] <jamesaa> xec, oh thanks
[14:49:37] <Delfaras> Hello, I'm having some troubles with auto width using animate. Anyone knows about this issue ?
[14:50:48] <tw2113> my hunch says that it needs a pixel based value
[14:52:09] <mib_mib> i need to add a listener function to a page that checks for the existence of a DOM element, but i do not control the page (or the creation of this element) - how can i bind a listener to listen for the creation / existence of this element?
[14:52:33] <Eviltwin> mib_mib: You cannot
[14:52:52] <mib_mib> Eviltwin: what if i constantly polled the DOM?
[14:52:55] <Delfaras> Only pixed based ? I have some divs that can have several different size, I won't be able to have a fixed value for the div
[14:52:57] <Eviltwin> Please don't
[14:53:14] <mib_mib> Eviltwin: what you mean is i cant do it easily?
[14:53:48] <Eviltwin> Instead do something like this: $("<div>").trigger("adding").appendTo("#target").trigger("added")
[14:53:57] <tw2113> Delfaras, i wonder if you can use animate and toggleClass in conjunction
[14:54:02] <Eviltwin> And $("#myelement").trigger("removing").remove().trigger("removed");
[14:54:04] <Eviltwin> Or something like that
[14:54:21] <Eviltwin> Then you can do $("#myelement").on("removing", function() { ... });
[14:54:30] <Eviltwin> The key is you are triggering the events yourself
[14:56:06] <Delfaras> tw2113: I'll try that
[14:58:10] <mib_mib> Eviltwin: interesting, i'll have to try that
[15:00:52] <Delfaras> tw2113: http://jsfiddle.net/cXKeM This is what I'm trying to do
[15:01:16] <Delfaras> tw2113: I don't see the solution without auto widths
[15:03:46] <mib_mib> Eviltwin: my goal is to listen for google search results, and then when they are populated, manipulate them - is there an easier way to do this?
[15:04:05] <mib_mib> Eviltwin: this is bundled into a google chrome extension
[15:04:09] <Spike_Manana> Can someone help me with this http://pastebin.com/AneCsurp function. I can't get the value for resourceContent variable in function call. Thank you.
[15:22:56] <dotstormz> hi guys. I am using Paul irishes image loading plugin to determine if an image has loaded and animate.

[16:52:19] <AlexWaters> or is there a better way?
[16:55:27] <tw2113> you could get rid of the " + " part

[18:33:40] <RandalSchwartz> awesome - got my state/country pop-up working.  any feedback on http://jsfiddle.net/merlyn/RZ5UU/ would be welcome.
[18:35:20] <RandalSchwartz> obviously, more data would be added.  just did a few for now.
[18:36:08] <coldhead> RandalSchwartz: {} is more idiomatic than new Object();
[18:36:14] <RandalSchwartz> ahh, ok
[18:36:42] <tw2113> i was going to say since the country field controls what shows up in the state field, may not be bad to reverse the order
[18:37:07] <RandalSchwartz> reverse which order?
[18:37:19] <tw2113> the left and middle fields
[18:37:22] <RandalSchwartz> oh - just the inputs
[18:37:28] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, well this is the client's order.
[18:37:34] <tw2113> oh clients
[18:37:38] <RandalSchwartz> and it's often confusing how that works out
[18:37:52] <RandalSchwartz> you hit state, and it says "pick country first" :)
[18:38:32] <RandalSchwartz> this is set up so I can send 0's for "new input", and real values for existing updates.
[18:39:29] <RandalSchwartz> otherwise, am I doiing anything jquery-silly?
[18:39:38] <coldhead> it looks good to me, RandalSchwartz
[18:39:46] <RandalSchwartz> it seemed odd to have to copy name/val/id
[18:39:52] <coldhead> i like the way you indent your chains
[18:39:55] <coldhead> highly readable
[18:39:55] <RandalSchwartz> is there any way to say "copy pretty much anything"
[18:40:19] <RandalSchwartz> since I'm replacing a <input type=text> with an <input type=select>
[18:40:20] <coldhead> clone() ?
[18:40:21] <b-ot> No output.
[18:40:31] <coldhead> thanks bot-t >: |
[18:40:39] <coldhead> ?clone
[18:40:40] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[18:40:50] <RandalSchwartz> would clone do that?  could I clone it and just change the type?
[18:41:04] <coldhead> ah, no that screws up in some browsers
[18:41:16] <coldhead> i can't remember the specifics
[18:41:33] <RandalSchwartz> I think I'm gonna need only name/attr/id
[18:41:42] <RandalSchwartz> name/val/id
[18:41:47] <coldhead> i remember its an issue when people try to convert type="password" to type="input"
[18:41:52] <coldhead> and possibly other cases
[18:41:54] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, I recall something like that
[18:42:18] <RandalSchwartz> .. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1544317/jquery-change-type-of-input-field
[18:42:38] <RandalSchwartz> ... // We can't allow the type property to be changed (since it causes problems in IE)
[18:42:42] <coldhead> angus_c: any improvements on http://jsfiddle.net/merlyn/RZ5UU/ ?
[18:42:53] <RandalSchwartz> it's even in the jquery source
[18:43:50] <RandalSchwartz> basically, any id="state_FOO" and id="country_FOO" are paired
[18:43:57] <RandalSchwartz> I figured that'd be the easiest for dyn alloc
[18:45:55] <RandalSchwartz> my javascript skills are increasing. :)
[18:46:20] <coldhead> if angus_c can't find anything to pick up on you're doing very well
[18:46:24] <RandalSchwartz> heh
[18:47:13] <RandalSchwartz> the big problem now is that we have 3500 entries in that states_for_country, and I was downloading that separately for each state/country field pair on a page.
[18:47:25] <RandalSchwartz> so I'm trying to just download it once, and feed the current values using a simple text field.
[18:48:23] <RandalSchwartz> is there a way to assign var countries so that it's allocated only once?
[18:48:33] <RandalSchwartz> or will I need to GC it on each page hit?
[18:49:08] <bc> why is it telling me O is undefined? Shouldn't O be availble by then? http://jsfiddle.net/mBr9r/
[18:49:43] <RandalSchwartz> bc - var O is local to the first function
[18:49:56] <RandalSchwartz> and that goes away at the end
[18:50:04] <RandalSchwartz> so the second function is a different scope
[18:50:08] <RandalSchwartz> make O globa
[18:50:09] <RandalSchwartz> globa
[18:50:10] <bc> dang it
[18:50:11] <RandalSchwartz> global
[18:50:14] <RandalSchwartz> damn - can't type
[18:50:24] <bc> RandalSchwartz: I see, I don't know what I was thinking.
[18:50:28] <RandalSchwartz> heh
[18:50:35] <RandalSchwartz> I completely understand
[18:51:14] <RandalSchwartz> so back in my case, similarly... can I make countries and states_for_country somehow only be initialized once no matter how many pages say <script src="foo.js"> ?
[18:51:33] <RandalSchwartz> is there a "browser" scope?
[18:51:59] <RandalSchwartz> I know there's a window scope, but that's new each time. :)
[18:52:48] <shoky> is your concern download time, or actual object creation time?
[18:53:15] <coldhead> i think you need localStorage, RandalSchwartz
[18:53:46] <coldhead> there's no other way to preserve your working betwen pages
[18:53:50] <coldhead> if i understand you right
[18:54:06] <RandalSchwartz> looks like "this." means global if outside a function
[18:54:15] <RandalSchwartz> ... https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
[18:54:22] <coldhead> it's "window" usually, in the browser
[18:54:26] <shoky> this == window by defa.. yes
[18:54:44] <RandalSchwartz> oh - so not broader than window
[18:54:46] <RandalSchwartz> not useful then
[18:54:54] <shoky> window is the broadest
[18:55:07] <RandalSchwartz> ok - so my code is about as efficient as it gets
[18:55:16] <RandalSchwartz> since the window has to script-src my .js
[18:55:19] <RandalSchwartz> the .js is cached though
[18:55:25] <shoky> sure
[18:56:22] <RandalSchwartz> so I might as well put var countries = ...;
[18:56:31] <RandalSchwartz> so that the rest of my funcs see it as a closure.
[18:57:15] <shoky> isn't that what you're doing?
[18:57:18] <RandalSchwartz> yes
[18:57:32] <RandalSchwartz> took me a bit to work out how to iterate an array, until I remembered $.each :)
[18:58:33] <RandalSchwartz> so on an object, $.each(someObj, function (i, it) { ... })
[18:58:37] <RandalSchwartz> i is the key, it is the value?
[18:58:52] <shoky> yea, i usually just write function(key,val)
[18:58:57] <RandalSchwartz> yeah ok
[18:59:10] <RandalSchwartz> for an array, i = 0..n
[18:59:27] <RandalSchwartz> that is handy though
[18:59:29] <shoky> aye
[18:59:31] <RandalSchwartz> no need to invent scope vars
[18:59:52] <RandalSchwartz> was thinking something like var i; for(i in obj) { ... }
[19:00:00] <RandalSchwartz> but $.each makes that easier
[19:00:23] <shoky> and more importantly it gives a local scope to that 'i'
[19:00:32] <RandalSchwartz> yup
[19:01:48] <L1> Recommendations for a lightbox? There's an overwhelming number to chose from. Prefer lightweight, can display images or HTML, and can group images into sets
[19:06:28] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - I could use .attributes to get all attributes
[19:06:31] <RandalSchwartz> then cycle over them
[19:25:29] * RandalSchwartz thanks #jquery for the input, and moves on
[19:29:10] <coldhead> gob bless you, mister schwartz
[19:29:40] <tw2113> gorb*
[19:33:35] <shoky> use the schwartz

[19:48:31] <youi> i have to stop the form submission when i have invalid fields

[19:49:13] <youi> ha
[19:49:17] <tw2113> ok, enough bad 90s jokes
[19:49:19] <youi> yeah i could use a banana peel right now

[20:13:57] <bid> hi, how can i apply jquery to an element if i am getting it from onclick="func(this)" i need his sibilings, so what i need to do inside func? this element have no id or name.
[20:14:22] <ryanneufeld> ?click @ bid
[20:14:22] <bot-t> bid, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[20:15:52] <bid> ummm the onclick part is ok. just want to know if inside the function func(t){} i can do somthing to get t sibilings
[20:22:11] <tw2113> back
[20:22:17] <ryanneufeld> ?siblings @ bid
[20:22:17] <bot-t> bid, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[20:22:33] <ryanneufeld> $(this).siblings() @bid
[20:47:25] <abstrusenick> is there any text select event on iOS?
[20:55:43] <sasori> can someone give me a hint how to approach this?..e.g i displayed a data....then there's an edit button...if I click edit, then the data should turn into an input form with it's data in it so it can be editable..if the save button is clicked, the input form disappears and data becomes read-only again
[20:57:02] <btipling> sasori: two elements, a textara and a div, hide the former in view mode, hide the latter in write mode
[20:57:23] <btipling> texarea*
[20:57:39] <btipling> you can also make a div editable but I don't recommend it
[20:58:09] <sasori> ok thanks, btipling
[20:58:12] <btipling> np
[21:06:38] <min|dvir|us> How do I get the index of an element $el in a collection of elements $els?
[21:09:04] <Nicolas_Leonida2> $('#enteriesLoadMore').on("click", "document", function(e){});
[21:09:22] <Nicolas_Leonida2> isn't this supposed to bind click events for elements that are dynamically added to the page in future as well?
[21:38:20] <coldhead> Nicolas_Leonida2: you have the #id and document in the wrong order
[21:38:45] <coldhead> and you don't want to quote document, it's not a selector
[21:40:03] <tw2113> last night i saw someone type $(.has(something))
[21:41:50] <coldhead> ow
[21:56:11] <afidegnum> hello good mornig all, pls I need assitance,
[21:56:33] <afidegnum> pls how do I set dependent select box.. i.e I select countries Usa  which willl then list states... to be selected
[22:01:02] <RandalSchwartz> afidegnum - what have you tried?
[22:01:47] <shoky> it's like you guys were meant for eachother
[22:02:25] <shoky> well, mostly one for the other.
[22:04:25] <RandalSchwartz> heh
[22:29:23] <afidegnum> RandalSchwartz: well, what happens, when I click on the dependent list, the child list appear. but when I change the list from the parent dropdown, the child does not change.
[22:29:33] <afidegnum> you can see the example here... http://mobile.thel.us/residence.php
[22:31:26] <afidegnum> here is the source. http://pastebin.com/RWsQbetG
[22:52:19] <afidegnum> any answer pls ?
[23:07:11] <sahbeewah> afidegnum: id attributes cannot start with numbers (so it cannot be a number)
[23:07:23] <sahbeewah> also, your first select tag doesn't have a matching closing tag
[23:07:42] <sasori> what could possibly the problem, if my simple click function to a button to say alert hello wont' work..but when i try in firebug console and click the same button , it works
[23:08:57] <sahbeewah> sasori: what exactly did you do in the firebug console to "try it" there?
[23:10:44] <sasori> sahbeewah: jQuery('#editgrpmsg').click(function(){ alert("hello"); });
[23:11:08] <sasori> in my code i tried either using $ ...or jQuery.noConflict() ...but none of them work
[23:11:12] <sasori> only in firebug
[23:11:14] <sasori> works
[23:12:11] <sahbeewah> perhaps the element does not exist at the time that you're trying to attach the click handler
[23:12:29] <sahbeewah> is your jquery in a ready block?
[23:13:19] <sasori> nope
[23:13:29] <sasori> i included it at the top of the page
[23:13:34] <sasori> not inside a ready block
[23:14:15] <sahbeewah> okay... so that's your problem...
[23:14:45] <sahbeewah> wrap it in a $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[23:14:51] <sasori> ok lemme try
[23:15:09] <sasori> is $(function(){}); not the same with $(document).ready(function(){}); ?
[23:15:23] <sahbeewah> it is the same
[23:15:35] <sasori> ok :( .i already included it inside :(
[23:16:22] <afidegnum> hello, pls I couldn't get your last message, my filezilla crashed, meanwhile, here is my new code
[23:16:26] <afidegnum> http://pastebin.com/dtBCX3CK
[23:16:52] <afidegnum> sahbeewah: pls what do i suppose todo?
[23:17:44] <tw2113> last thing said to you afidegnum
[23:17:45] <tw2113> sahbeewah> afidegnum: id attributes cannot start with numbers (so it cannot be a number)
[23:18:04] <sahbeewah> sasori: console log jQuery('#editgrpmsg').length to see if it's finding the element
[23:18:10] <tw2113> oops, missed "also, your first select tag doesn't have a matching closing tag"
[23:18:52] <sasori> sahbeewah: i got a reply of 1
[23:20:21] <sahbeewah> sasori, okay i don't know what else could be the problem without further context
[23:20:35] <afidegnum> sahbeewah: can you pls give a hint ?
[23:20:37] <sahbeewah> if you paste the code somewhere that could help
[23:20:45] <sasori> sahbeewah: ok 1 moment
[23:21:23] <sahbeewah> afidegnum, tw2113 just repeated what i said.. fix those problems first
[23:21:29] <sahbeewah> also, tw2113 thanks
[23:21:34] <tw2113> ;)
[23:22:06] <tw2113> gave me something to do during a dialog free moment in this movie
[23:22:50] <sasori> sahbeewah: http://pastie.org/4688892
[23:23:02] <afidegnum> edoes it mean <option class="city" id="1">Alabama</option> it="1" should be changed to a letter instead of a number ?
[23:25:58] <sahbeewah> sasori, still looks like it should work
[23:26:09] <sahbeewah> when i said console log it, you did it in the file, rather than the firebug console, right?
[23:26:14] <sasori> sahbeewah: yeah...i know..but it's really weird :(
[23:26:24] <sasori> in the file?
[23:26:30] <sasori> i thought in the firebug console
[23:27:13] <sasori> how should i see the result of this console.log(jQuery('#editgrpmsg').length) if i do that in the file itself ?
[23:27:14] <sahbeewah> no, do a console.log(...) in the file, it will work in the console after it has loaded because obviously you could do the click handler on it there
[23:27:35] <sahbeewah> it will appear in the console!
[23:27:36] <sahbeewah> magically
[23:28:15] <afidegnum> sahbeewah: the result is more nastier... have a look at teh code http://pastebin.com/ifYVEdKP
[23:28:38] <sahbeewah> afidegnum, changing it to a letter will make it "valid" and will probably make it work, but you should probably reconsider the design as a whole so that you don't need those ids
[23:28:39] <afidegnum> and look at how it displays here. http://mobile.thel.us/residence.php
[23:29:05] <afidegnum> can you please propose an alternative ?
[23:29:46] <sasori> sahbeewah: i did <script>console.log(jQuery('#editgrpmsg').length)</script> just above the links,, nothing appeared in the firebug console
[23:30:10] <sahbeewah> afidegnum, you didn't change the ids of the select boxes accordingly... i.e. selectmenu1 => selectmenua
[23:30:21] <sahbeewah> selectmenub, rather
[23:31:32] <sahbeewah> sasori, nothing appeared in the console?
[23:31:44] <sahbeewah> do you have a link to the site?
[23:32:18] <sasori> sahbeewah: nothing appeared....i don't have one..it's just in my localhost
[23:32:42] <sasori> it's actually a huge app powered by a framework..am not sure if there's a conflict of what in the javascript stuff
[23:34:28] <sahbeewah> sasori, if it doesn't show anything in the console, that means there was a javascript error beforehand which has halted all execution
[23:34:40] <sahbeewah> but there should be an error msg in the console if that occurs
[23:34:47] <sahbeewah> which i'm assuming there isn't
[23:36:00] <afidegnum> ok
[23:39:10] <sasori> T_T
[23:40:21] <sahbeewah> sasori: someone else can probably help you
[23:40:46] <sasori> sahbeewah: ok..this is a simple yet major road block..darn :((
[23:42:13] <afidegnum> sahbeewah: hmm, the whole issue is now unbearable. please look at this http://pastebin.com/Yt3LdJRv
[23:42:33] <afidegnum> the form doesn't display properly anymore.
[23:46:21] <sahbeewah> afidegnum, id attributes need to be unique to a page as well
[23:46:31] <sahbeewah> but your major problem is
[23:47:28] <sahbeewah> wait what is $(".selectmenub").hide();   meant to do
[23:47:42] <sahbeewah> because it's not doing anything
[23:48:12] <sahbeewah> the dot is a class selector
[23:48:38] <afidegnum> ok
[23:49:32] <sahbeewah> ok your major problem is that jquery mobile is a bitch and doing hide on that element will still show the select
[23:49:47] <sahbeewah> because it's only a subclass of the wrapped select drop down
[23:50:07] <sahbeewah> you'll need to hide the upper div which has the ui-select class
[23:52:42] <afidegnum> ?
[23:55:19] <tw2113> i can't even get it to show up in jsbin
[23:58:38] <tw2113> the fid works though
