[02:03:36] <suexec_> I am reloading content in a div using ajax. My code to replace content is $(sender).closest(".i-am-top-parent").find("div.content").empty().append(response); . My problem is that when I remove an element in the dom, the change isn't reflected. If I add an element, it works fine. Any ideas?
[02:10:58] <Cork> suexec_: .empty().append(response) can be replaced with .html(response)
[02:11:15] <Cork> and it is too little context to tell why remove doesn't work
[02:11:27] <suexec_> Cork, I found the error. I was plebbing. As always.
[02:12:21] <suexec_> Cork, I read on some blog that .html shouldn't be a replacement for DOM modification ? Because of the documentation of .html() and how it might change in the future ?
[02:12:54] <Cork> suexec_: no, it won't change in that way
[02:13:12] <suexec_> Cool. SHOULD I change it to .html? Is that more correct ?
[02:13:54] <Cork> suexec_: they are identical
[02:14:35] <suexec_> Alright. html it is.
[02:14:40] <suexec_> Thanks Cork, as always :)
[02:15:16] <Cork> suexec_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#436
[02:16:01] <Cork> opps should be https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L436
[05:14:09] <anli> Does newer jQuery versions protect against multiple inclusion?
[05:18:29] <Cork> anli: not more then the old versions
[06:11:15] <LIERO> $(".myform").submit(function (e) { ... })
[06:11:54] <LIERO> why does this execute on submit buttons outside of forms with the "myform" class?
[06:13:39] <localh0st> LIERO: jsfiddle
[06:35:11] <Cork> LIERO: submit is on forms not buttons
[08:16:01] <anli> How do I change value of an input using the dev console?
[08:16:04] <anli> (chrome)
[08:50:31] <Cork> anli: $('input selector').val('new value')
[08:51:34] <anli> I want to make use of the dev console gui to do it
[08:51:46] <Cork> you can't
[08:51:51] <anli> Really?
[08:52:04] <anli> Wow, that cant be it
[08:52:05] <Cork> if you want to change value in an input click in the input on the page and change it
[08:52:40] <anli> I want to set the value without interacting with the element
[08:52:42] <Cork> if you want to change the value without interactive with the ui select out the element and modify the doms value property
[08:54:43] <Cork> so the closest you can get is
[08:54:47] <Cork> select it in elements
[08:54:58] <Cork> then in the console type $0.value = "new value"
[08:55:48] <anli> Hm, did not know about $0 actually
[08:55:55] <anli> It is almost acceptable
[08:56:01] <Cork> its inherited from firebug
[08:56:18] <Cork> (same as console and $ and $$)
[09:41:41] <Nece228> hello, im trying to figure out a way how to make checkbox selector select the rows which contain all of the values of the checkboxes, and not one of them: https://jsfiddle.net/39yr2eng/3/
[09:41:47] <anli> What is $ then? thats jquery I hope
[09:42:32] <Nece228> in this case, if i select dashboard, and then payments, the row should disappear, because it doesnt contain both, but only of them
[09:52:53] <Nece228> i suppose ".contains" has to be changed with something else
[09:53:20] <taplar> contains is fine.  but you're logic is only taking one value into account at a time
[09:53:34] <taplar> you're not taking into account if there was a value not found prior
[09:54:03] <taplar> line 10 is saying, if I am found, regardless of others not found, show it
[09:55:40] <Nece228> taplar: exactly, it should be if i am found, but the other is not found, dont show it
[09:56:25] <Nece228> show only the ones that contain all of the checkboxes values selected
[09:57:24] <taplar> right, so line 10 needs to see if the row contains tds with each value.  if not, don't show it
[09:57:37] <Nece228> taplar: yeah exactly, how to do that
[09:57:37] <taplar> but to do that, you need all the values of the checked checkboxes
[09:58:16] <taplar> step 1, try to figure out how to get the values of all the checked checkboxes into a variable
[10:12:49] <taplar> how's it going?
[10:13:33] <hlve> i'm in alabamer
[10:13:56] <taplar> lol
[10:18:51] <hlve> Till tomorrow anyways.
[10:19:03] <hlve> Hopefully we don't have delays. We started getting the rain from Harvey here this morning
[10:19:24] <taplar> We're supossed to get some of it this evening, or after noon some time
[10:19:50] <hlve> it's awful outside right now. It started coming down in buckets lol
[10:20:04] <taplar> hope you got a SP
[10:20:13] <hlve> SP?
[10:20:21] <taplar> surge p
[10:20:25] <hlve> Ah
[10:20:39] <hlve> I'm at the office right now, so if all goes south (lol no pun intended) it's on them
[10:20:51] <taplar> heh
[10:21:21] <hlve> I had to come down here for work for four days. It's been an interesting trip. Great food and awesome people down here.
[10:21:50] <taplar> You should come over to AR and visit us.  We got..... uh.... trees.
[10:21:52] <hlve> Our rental broke down yesterday though, so that was a mess
[10:21:55] <hlve> lol.
[10:22:05] <hlve> What kinda trees ;)
[10:22:20] <taplar> medium high trees
[10:22:25] <taplar> and fake mountains
[10:22:30] <taplar> lots of fake mountains
[10:22:36] <hlve> Ah
[10:22:42] <hlve> fake mountains lol
[10:23:18] <taplar> :D  I only say that cause I think I read some where about what elevation it takes for something to be considered a 'mountain'.  I think our highest point doesn't reach it.
[10:23:48] <taplar> but robert may have corrected me on that, now that i think about it
[10:24:10] <taplar> something about not just elevation, but incline.  *shrugs*
[10:24:43] <hlve> looks and smells like a mountain. it's a mountain
[11:13:19] <MikeD_> what does a mountain smell like?
[11:45:39] <hlve> i'd imagine trees
[11:45:43] <hlve> and animals
[11:45:46] <hlve> and all the things.
[11:46:09] <taplar> pollen
[11:53:55] <hlve> lol. it's SO gross out
[11:53:58] <hlve> holy shit,
[11:54:03] <hlve> rain, everywheres.
[13:35:46] <hydrian> Ello all
[13:38:03] <hydrian> Is there a way to assign 'this' to the anonymous function that assigned by adding an event handler?
[13:38:37] <hydrian> I know mootools has .bind() but I don't see anything like that in the jquery docs. Am I missing something?
[13:38:51] <taplar> bind() is a javascript method
[14:07:18] <plamb> is there a way to bind to an injected html element after the page is loaded
[14:07:36] <plamb> say my jquery puts a new element into the page at some point
[14:07:43] <plamb> can i bind to that new element?
[14:07:48] <taplar> you can bind to any element you can get a reference to
[14:07:59] <plamb> can i get a reference to it after the page is loaded though?
[14:08:23] <taplar> i'm not sure i understand your confusion
[14:08:28] <robertmaxrees> why not just use a delegated listener?
[14:08:30] <taplar> if it's in the dom, you can find it
[14:08:47] <plamb> its not in the DOM when the page loads, only after a user interacts with an input
[14:08:52] <taplar> so?
[14:08:56] <robertmaxrees> delegation.
[14:09:01] <taplar> you can find it after that point.  and that ^
[14:09:06] <plamb> i just figured that was the reason my click handler wasnt firing
[14:09:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:09:20] <robertmaxrees> delegated listeners solve that problem
[14:09:26] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:09:31] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:09:57] <taplar> but just so it is clear.  you do understand that once something is in the dom, regardless of if it is there at page load or afterwards, you can find it. right?
[14:10:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:10:26] <plamb> i do, i was just guessing at why the click handler wasnt firing
[14:10:29] <plamb> looking at delegation
[14:10:47] <taplar> so were you thinking that $(selector) would also find the new elements?
[14:10:52] <plamb> yes
[14:10:59] <taplar> so what does $(selector) do?
[14:11:05] <plamb> or that was my primitive code
[14:11:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:11:24] <plamb> but looking back it makes sense that it doesnt
[14:11:29] <taplar> k
[14:11:31] <robertmaxrees> plamb fwiw $('selector') only selects elements that exist at the time you run it.
[14:11:47] <plamb> yeah makes sense
[14:11:51] <taplar> :)
[14:17:46] <plamb> can the delegated elem be a child of any depth
[14:17:51] <plamb> or does it have to be an immediate child
[14:18:40] <taplar> the selector in the on?
[14:18:45] <plamb> yes
[14:18:48] <taplar> any depth
[14:19:12] <taplar> the event from  that element bubbles up.  so long as it is not stopped, it doesn't matter the depth
[15:23:11] <Lagmonster> Hi guys, I have a question.
[15:24:24] <Lagmonster> I have a simple text-input where on input another text box should be changed. $(".selection").on('input',function(){ ... }
[15:24:42] <Lagmonster> In this function, if I call $(this) it returns 2 objects, both the text box as well as the div it's embedded in
[15:24:51] <Lagmonster> Can someone explain to me the intuition behind that?
[15:25:14] <taplar> can you show us an example fiddle of that behaviour?
[15:25:43] <taplar> 'this' in that handler should be the selection that got the input event
[15:26:15] <Lagmonster> I can try, don't know if it will work in the fiddle as it does in my code, because I am writing custom js code in a framework that wraps more code around it, so that may be the cause
[15:28:34] <Lagmonster> Hm, I can't easily recreate it, as it uses custom HTML code that isn't standard.
[15:33:46] <Lagmonster> What's weird is that$(this) returns 2 objects, but it's not an array
[15:33:56] <Lagmonster> invoking .length gives me two times "1"
[15:34:01] <taplar> uh
[15:34:05] <Lagmonster> and i cannot select one or the other by calling [0] or [1]
[15:34:07] <taplar> sounds like you are double binding
[15:34:30] <Lagmonster> What does that mean?
[15:34:41] <taplar> you have one binding, console logging the length
[15:34:46] <taplar> and it prints "1" twice?
[15:34:49] <Lagmonster> yes
[15:34:56] <taplar> that means the binding is on it twice
[15:35:01] <Lagmonster> if i alert($(this).length) I get 2 alerts that say "1"
[15:35:05] <taplar> right
[15:35:10] <taplar> cause the binding is on it multiple times
[15:35:25] <Lagmonster> How can I change that?
[15:35:41] <taplar> you'll have to look at it and find out why that binding logic is being ran twice
[15:36:20] <Lagmonster> :S I've been trying that. Like I said, it's the div that the textbox is contained in, and the textbox itself. I have no idea what crowdflower is doing there
[15:36:47] <taplar> i'm talking about the $(".selection").on('input',function(){ ... } part
[15:36:54] <taplar> that console log is inside that inner function, right?
[15:37:02] <Lagmonster> yeah
[15:37:13] <Lagmonster>     $(".selection").on('input',function(){       alert($(this).length[0]);     });
[15:37:14] <taplar> then whatever logic invokes that outer part, is running twice
[15:37:18] <taplar> right
[15:37:37] <taplar> the on() method is being called twice, so it is binding that handler to the selections twice
[15:37:38] <Lagmonster> ah
[15:37:46] <Lagmonster> ahhh
[15:37:47] <Lagmonster> I get it.
[15:38:04] <Lagmonster> is it possible that input works on keyup and keydown or something?
[15:38:17] <taplar> it's derived from that
[15:38:34] <taplar> but it doesn't have to be just that
[15:38:43] <taplar> as i believe pasting makes inputs too
[15:41:12] <Lagmonster> I see what the problem is
[15:41:25] <Lagmonster> I call it on $(.selection) and this is actually a custom field.
[15:41:30] <Lagmonster>     <cml:text label="Ask question here:" class="selection" id="selection" validates="required" aggregate="agg"/>
[15:41:57] <Lagmonster> It propagates the class into a div and a textbox
[15:42:07] <Lagmonster> so by calling $(.selection) I find both
[15:42:25] <taplar> sure
[15:43:20] <Lagmonster> so by using "input.selection" that fixes it
[15:43:24] <Lagmonster> Thank you taplar
[15:43:28] <Lagmonster> that helped me understand what's going on!!
[15:43:35] <taplar> awesome
[15:43:44] <Lagmonster> high-five
[16:26:54] <vbwyrde> Hi ... I have this code var n = $('#<%=chkWorldGenre.ClientID%>:checkbox:checked').length;  ... but it is only producing 0 regardless of the number of checkboxes I click
[16:26:57] <vbwyrde> anyone know why?
[16:28:07] <taplar> what do you get if you take off the :checked part?
[16:29:45] <vbwyrde> let me try it.
[16:30:13] <vbwyrde> same thing
[16:30:14] <vbwyrde> 0
[16:30:30] <taplar> so the other parts of your selector are inaccurate
[16:30:41] <vbwyrde> I also tried this:  var n = $('#<%=chkWorldGenre.ClientID%>:checked').length;   but same thing
[16:31:12] <vbwyrde> I have a checkbox named chkWorldGenre... I need to get how many are checked so I can limit it to 4 max.
[16:31:14] <taplar> is '<%=chkWorldGenre.ClientID%>' what is generated in the selector, or is that pre-generation?
[16:31:16] <vbwyrde> I'm not sure how to get it
[16:31:30] <vbwyrde> that generates the selector for asp.net
[16:31:41] <taplar> so what is the actual selector it is running?
[16:31:45] <vbwyrde> it gets the control ID after it has been rendered
[16:32:02] <taplar> wait
[16:32:14] <taplar> you took off the :checkbox part, not the :checked part
[16:32:20] <vbwyrde> I tried it both ways
[16:32:30] <vbwyrde> by the way - thank you for helping!
[16:32:35] <taplar> ok, yeah, so you need to figure out what the actual selector is that is being ran
[16:32:44] <vbwyrde> not sure how
[16:32:53] <vbwyrde> (kinda new to jquery)
[16:33:49] <taplar> var n = $('#<%=chkWorldGenre.ClientID%>'); console.log(n);
[16:33:54] <taplar> what does it say the context is?
[16:34:09] <vbwyrde> ok hold on
[16:34:51] <vbwyrde> [span#mp1_ContentPlaceHolder1_chkWorldGenre.checkboxlist_nowrap, context: document, selector: "#mp1_ContentPlaceHolder1_chkWorldGenre"]
[16:35:08] <vbwyrde> hm
[16:35:11] <taplar> "#mp1_ContentPlaceHolder1_chkWorldGenre"
[16:35:12] <vbwyrde> interesting
[16:35:17] <taplar> thats' the id it's looking for
[16:35:28] <vbwyrde> yes that's asp.net's master page reference
[16:35:42] <vbwyrde> I'll check in the source to see but I think that is the actual ID
[16:36:07] <taplar> so pop open your browser console and try to find that element on the page
[16:36:44] <vbwyrde> this is what is in the source <input id="mp1_ContentPlaceHolder1_chkWorldGenre_0" type="checkbox" name="mp1$ContentPlaceHolder1$chkWorldGenre$0" value="143" />
[16:36:54] <taplar> _0
[16:37:06] <vbwyrde> so that's the first element in the checkbox list
[16:37:23] <taplar> no, you're selector does not have the _0 at the end
[16:37:49] <arosen> anyone have a trick or solution to dealing with the bottom bookmark toolbar on safari in mobile?
[16:38:00] <vbwyrde> I don't know how to add that in so far as the list is built from the database so I don't know how many there will be.
[16:38:09] <vbwyrde> I'm looking for a generic way of doing the count
[16:38:13] <vbwyrde> so far ... no luck
[16:38:21] <taplar> you may want to ask an asp room then
[16:38:30] <vbwyrde> yup.  I did.
[16:38:37] <vbwyrde> it's pretty um ... well ... not busy in there.
[16:38:39] <vbwyrde> :p
[16:38:52] <taplar> can't really help you much in here though
[16:39:05] <taplar> the id doesn't match the selector.  both, i assume, are generated/set by asp
[16:39:05] <vbwyrde> ok.  I thought maybe theres some asper's in here as well
[16:39:07] <vbwyrde> just in cse.
[16:39:53] <vbwyrde> the checkbox list is a span ... the source looks like this:  <span id="mp1_ContentPlaceHolder1_chkWorldGenre" Class="checkboxlist_nowrap" style="display:inline-block;width:100%;">
[16:39:59] <vbwyrde> which has the right id.
[16:40:33] <taplar> what are you calling the 'source'?
[16:40:39] <vbwyrde> page source
[16:40:42] <vbwyrde> "view page source"
[16:40:48] <taplar> page source is what was returned from the server
[16:40:53] <vbwyrde> yes
[16:40:55] <taplar> it doesn't reflect any changes made afterwards
[16:41:01] <taplar> the element could be gone
[16:41:11] <taplar> which is why you either inspect elements, or run commands in the console to find
[16:41:20] <vbwyrde> oo
[16:41:23] <vbwyrde> oh wow
[16:41:25] <vbwyrde> didn't know that
[16:41:27] <vbwyrde> ok
[16:41:58] <vbwyrde> the inspector shows this:  <span id="mp1_ContentPlaceHolder1_chkWorldGenre" class="checkboxlist_nowrap" style="display:inline-block;width:100%;"><input id="mp1_ContentPlaceHolder1_chkWorldGenre_0" type="checkbox" name="mp1$ContentPlaceHolder1$chkWorldGenre$0" value="143"><label for="mp1_ContentPlaceHolder1_chkWorldGenre_0">Adult Content</label><br>

[16:42:24] <taplar> please don't paste code in the chat like that
[16:42:29] <vbwyrde> yes sorry!!!
[16:42:46] <vbwyrde> this chat client is new to me as well ... not quite used to how it works
[16:42:55] <vbwyrde> well, anyway, that's what the inspector showed.
[16:42:57] <vbwyrde> :p
[16:43:05] <vbwyrde> sorry again.
[16:43:51] <taplar> the place that you are doing the selector, try doing it staticlly.  console.log($("#mp1_ContentPlaceHolder1_chkWorldGenre").length)' and see what that says
[16:47:27] <vbwyrde> ok I got it
[16:47:45] <vbwyrde> I was missing a space between the name of the control and the rest of the selector:  var n = $('#<%=chkWorldGenre.ClientID%> :checkbox:checked').length;
[16:47:47] <vbwyrde> that works
[16:47:55] <vbwyrde> :)
[16:47:58] <taplar> cool
[16:48:01] <vbwyrde> ok thanks a lot.
[16:48:05] <vbwyrde> much obliged!
[16:49:07] <vbwyrde> by the way, i have a question about the jquery version I'm using ... I'm on a really old version and I want to upgrade to the latest... but a lot of my code is breakybreaky when I try and I got lost trying to fix it.  I don't suppose you happen to know of a good utility that would help me get through the upgrade process?
[16:49:48] <taplar> what version are you on?
[16:52:07] <vbwyrde> v1.11.1
[16:53:31] <taplar> have you tried going to v1.12 first?
[16:54:16] <vbwyrde> iirc I tried using an upgrade tool that did that first, yes
[16:55:21] <vbwyrde> I was already a little lost at that point, but I thought I had fixed what was there... it was the second jump to v3 that kinda blew me away ... I was pretty unsure I had used the tool correctly, and there were a lot of depreciated and defunct errors
[16:55:37] <vbwyrde> so I rolled back after three tries and said "ok ... maybe I try this again later"
[16:55:45] <taplar> going from v1.11 to v1.12 shouldn't really break much stuff, afaik
[16:55:53] <vbwyrde> yeah, it didn't
[16:55:53] <taplar> it's if you go from 1x to 2x or 3x
[16:55:59] <vbwyrde> it was the next jump that killed it.
[16:56:28] <vbwyrde> ok so I guess there's actually no easy / automated way to upgrade
[16:56:31] <taplar> cause 3x is different from 1x.  making that jump you'll have to fix the bugs as you find them
[16:56:33] <vbwyrde> just have to slog through it.
[16:56:37] <taplar> pretty much
[16:56:42] <vbwyrde> darn
[16:56:47] <vbwyrde> it was pretty painful
[16:56:49] <taplar> but you also have to ask yourself if you need 3x
[16:56:58] <taplar> what browser support are you required to have?
[16:57:11] <vbwyrde> any modern browser is ok
[16:57:21] <vbwyrde> chrome / firefox / safari
[16:57:21] <taplar> but what about older browser support?
[16:57:25] <vbwyrde> nah
[16:57:26] <taplar> IE?
[16:57:29] <vbwyrde> not really
[16:57:39] <vbwyrde> too small a user base at this point
[16:57:47] <vbwyrde> not going to worry about IE
[16:57:47] <taplar> ok, then yeah, you'll just have to work through the bugs that you find when converting
[16:58:10] <vbwyrde> there's only one thing that makes me consider upgrading.
[16:58:48] <vbwyrde> when I view the site in my galaxy s5 when I do an update operation it scrolls the screen a little bit.  just enough to hide the "return" button.  And only in that one case.
[16:59:03] <vbwyrde> I did some research and it's a known issue with that model of galaxy
[16:59:11] <vbwyrde> and the solution was ... you guessed it.
[16:59:13] <vbwyrde> v3
[16:59:28] <vbwyrde> it's so minor i'm like ... oh snap ... is this worth it??
[16:59:41] <vbwyrde> that's why I backed off
[17:00:08] <vbwyrde> of course for me ... it's kind of a drag because it's my phone and my website and I can't quite do all that I want because of this one dumb error.
[17:00:12] <vbwyrde> waah.
[17:00:27] <taplar> well, 3x also removed a lot of the older browser support so it made it smaller
[17:00:30] <vbwyrde> but as for my users ... I tend to think it wouldn't be a problem for 99.99% of them
[17:00:56] <taplar> and it added support for other things too
[17:01:19] <vbwyrde> probably galaxy s5 screen size. :p
[17:01:24] <taplar> http://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/
[17:01:32] <vbwyrde> yep
[17:01:53] <vbwyrde> ok well, I hope an automated tool for migrating betwen versions is in the works.  that would be swell.
[17:02:11] <vbwyrde> haha... I make myself laugh.  Yes, I know that's not happening.
[17:02:24] <taplar> https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/
[17:03:02] <vbwyrde> yup... that's the one I used the last time
[17:03:06] <vbwyrde> drove me a bit batty
[17:03:10] <taplar> ah
[17:04:04] <vbwyrde> ok... maybe I'll circle back around on that.  I was hoping someone had put together an automated tool to actually do the migration.  not a big deal.  My site works fine, no errors... it's just that one galaxy s5 issue
[17:04:12] <vbwyrde> I'm not going to tear my hair out over it.
[17:04:28] <vbwyrde> thanks again.
[17:04:31] <taplar> np
[17:26:03] <soppman> if people tell you so store json in a "jsonfile"
[17:26:20] <soppman> what is that, is the json string in a string.json what they mean?
[17:26:25] <taplar> probably
[17:26:32] <soppman> ok, thanks
