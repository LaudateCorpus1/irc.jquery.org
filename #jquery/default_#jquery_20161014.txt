[00:19:22] <Forbidd3n> Hey everyone. I know the unload method for jQuery was deprecated in v1.8. What would I use know to popup a message on browser close or leaving a page?
[00:29:24] <Forbidd3n> How would I send an ajax request when the user leaves the page?
[02:17:50] <arc_> umm ... is it possible for a site to send me a notification if i don't even have it open?
[02:18:05] <arc_> i'm pretty sure that just happened
[02:18:12] <arc_> a chrome notification*
[02:49:41] <ahoo> what is the best FOSS most flexible lightweight but powerful easy to use but still extremely customizable parallax library?
[06:14:40] <Teaboy> anyone know why I'm getting "TypeError: Cannot read property 'ownerDocument' of undefined" when using insertAfter(), but append() works fine?
[06:15:07] <Teaboy> the data is from a mustache template
[06:15:54] <Tennis> are you doing insertAfter and append in the same place?
[06:16:17] <Tennis> like the same line?
[06:16:30] <Teaboy> no, there's an if statement
[06:16:42] <Teaboy> if it's new data it's appended, if it's refreshed data it inserts in the right place
[06:17:06] <Teaboy> I'm an idiot, I fixed it
[06:17:10] <Tennis> cool
[06:17:16] <Teaboy> append() accepts an array, insertAfter() does not
[06:17:29] <Tennis> reading something about insertAfter only working if it exists in dom
[06:17:30] <Tennis> cool
[06:17:31] <Teaboy> $(array.join()).insertAfter() works
[06:17:37] <Teaboy> $(array).insertAfter() does not
[06:17:44] <Tennis> rubber duck reporting for duty
[06:18:05] <Teaboy> :D
[06:18:13] <Tennis> time for a cuppa I think
[06:18:41] <Teaboy> good idea
[08:36:50] <Pazician> Does anyone know why my tabbing isn't working here? https://jsfiddle.net/2hsfvagd/
[08:39:49] <shoky> Pazician: you need keydown, not keypress
[08:42:05] <Pazician> shoky: it's still jumping away even if I use keydown()
[08:46:49] <shoky> make a working jsfiddle showing the problem
[08:49:59] <MassDebates> Pazician: Silly goose! That's not working because you simply don't have enough code!
[09:05:26] <decx> uhh.. tab already does that without js?
[09:23:41] <Pazician> MassDebates: it's working till the third one, then it gets stuck for some reasons: https://jsfiddle.net/2hsfvagd/7/
[09:23:53] <Pazician> it's a wp gravity form btw
[09:24:10] <Pazician> the tabbing is messed up
[09:50:12] <fuchstronaut> Is there a more elegant way to get a copy of a template from HTML5's template tag other than: $( $('template').html() ) ?
[10:53:21] <verax5> wont work :(
[10:53:27] <verax5> says [object ] object
[10:53:27] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/Fk7UaZ4r
[10:57:02] <taplar> newAnchor is a jQuery object
[10:57:08] <taplar> you can't append them to text like that
[10:57:46] <taplar> try newAnchor.prop('outerHTML')
[10:59:30] <verax5> taplar
[10:59:33] <verax5> oi fixed it
[10:59:34] <verax5> but
[10:59:56] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/zdeCNiXH
[11:00:06] <verax5> no adding class, and titles are in text, not anchors
[11:00:51] <taplar> huh?
[11:03:45] <verax5> its not adding the anchor
[11:03:54] <verax5> just adding plain text instead
[11:04:28] <taplar> can you make a fiddle showing the issue?
[11:06:39] <verax5> Thats my code taplar. There's three piece of data. and in output I see [object] [object] [object] http://pastebin.com/iVM5wfCs
[11:06:56] <taplar> please make a fiddle.
[11:07:14] <taplar> most of us are at work and have stuff to do ourselves.  help us help you
[11:07:25] <verax5> taplar I don't have the data?
[11:07:37] <verax5> I'm working with json data that comes from server
[11:07:41] <taplar> you can mock that part out
[11:07:49] <taplar> just create a variable that has some dummy data
[11:12:25] <MikeD_> https://github.com/makesites/jquery-contenteditable/blob/master/jquery.contenteditable.js  is that a function that is being passed a function?  (iife passed a function)
[11:13:39] <taplar> looks like it
[11:13:54] <MikeD_> how does the second function accept $ ?
[11:14:19] <taplar> ln 23
[11:16:51] <MikeD_> ah, thanks... that wasn't obvious to me as it should have been
[11:17:06] <taplar> gotta love callbacks, :)
[11:20:12] <Alpha1125> Trying to find a data attribute that was programatically assigned.   https://jsfiddle.net/crkj7c7f/2/  ideas?  Chrome (latest).  I'm getting unrecognized expression.  I've tried the "abcd" with and without quotes.  adding a * before the [data], I'm not able to find the <tr> based on the data-uuid data attribute.
[11:22:28] <taplar> your selector is bad
[11:22:34] <taplar> [attribute="value"]
[11:22:40] <taplar> you have the ="" outside the []
[11:23:00] <MikeD_> does .data() add attributes?
[11:23:03] <taplar> and you should avoid doing attribute lookups, btw
[11:23:23] <taplar> no, data() will store the information in a cache that jquery uses
[11:23:32] <taplar> iirc
[11:23:58] <MikeD_> i didn't think so, but does that mean the selector consults that cache instead of the DOM ?
[11:24:13] <taplar> maybe?  i'd have to fiddle to see
[11:24:58] <MikeD_> so what is the advice to Alpha1125 regarding "find by attribute" ?
[11:25:11] <MikeD_> i imagine the fiddle is an oversimplification of the real use-case
[11:25:14] <taplar> put a class on the elements and use that
[11:25:15] <taplar> OR
[11:25:26] <taplar> store it in a variable before you append it so you don't even have to do a lookup
[11:25:41] <taplar> which actually he's already doing
[11:25:50] <taplar> dunno why the lookup is needed in this case.  possibly just learning
[11:26:19] <MikeD_> or the code above the comment is test setup that should have been in the markup section
[11:26:27] <MikeD_> and there's never been a variable
[11:26:36] <taplar> could be
[11:26:46] <MikeD_> and there's nothing useful in className
[11:26:47] <Alpha1125> it's actually, so I can use the data-value, to pass that data to an POST later on.
[11:27:35] <Alpha1125> I've got a JSON of all the data in a table.  If some sort of action happens on the row, I'd like to look up it's attribute, which i'm trying to set in the <tr>, and then go back into the JSON and update it there.
[11:27:51] <MikeD_> i'm still undecided on using .data() or data-* on html elements instead of having an actual MVC model
[11:28:04] <taplar> sure.  so set it with data(key, value) and then later get it with data(key)
[11:28:08] <Alpha1125> HOWEVER... when I'm trying to go the other direction JSON to know it's UUID... I want to find the <TR> which has that UUID... I can't seem to do.
[11:28:10] <taplar> or just data() to get all of them
[11:29:01] <Alpha1125> which is what the later part is... I'm find to find the <tr> which has that UUID, so I can manipulate it.
[11:29:33] <taplar> right, what i'm saying though is regardless of the existance of the data-* element, avoid lookups by attributes
[11:29:40] <taplar> use an id/class or something
[11:29:52] <taplar> if your starting from a nested element scope, use closest('tr')
[11:29:58] <Alpha1125> ahh. yeh, I guess I could do #id.  that'd work.
[11:30:07] <taplar> just something.  attribute selectors are inherently bad performance wise
[11:30:20] <robertmaxrees> also harder to read.
[11:30:34] <robertmaxrees> .filter() with a function is good times though.
[11:31:33] <MikeD_> who is building the html?
[11:32:10] <Alpha1125> MikeD_ ? I am.
[11:32:42] <MikeD_> sorry, i meant - is the html coming from php already built, or are you generating it in javascript ?
[11:33:43] <MikeD_> is it easy for you to change your data-uuid to just id ?
[11:34:11] <Alpha1125> MikeD_  I'm generating the JSON in php... and having JS built it form the JSON data.
[11:34:34] <MikeD_> i like to make a clear boundary between clientside/browser and serverside code because while I can do both it's good to have a sanity check before mixing development across tiers
[11:35:00] <MikeD_> oh, that's probably best-case scenario for this example then
[11:35:34] <Alpha1125> MikeD_ I think I'm doing it in the wrong mindset.  I'm using the DOM to hold important bits of information.  I'm also storing the original JSON as well.  The bits of information are needed in the DOM, as each row in the table I'm creating has a set of buttons (same buttons all the time).  But they need a key identifier (UUID) to send back to the server... so from the button... I can do something like this:
[11:36:03] <Alpha1125> uuid = $(button).closest('tr').attr('id')  // or smoething close to that
[11:36:48] <taplar> wait, attr('id')?
[11:36:52] <taplar> i thought you were doing data
[11:37:27] <MikeD_> yeah, that's the "or something" part
[11:38:14] <Alpha1125> taplar I was... I was convinced to use "ID", as it was hard for me to find that row, based on the available information I have
[11:38:50] <robertmaxrees> Alpha1125 are you trying to build your own MV* setup in JS?
[11:39:27] <Alpha1125> robertmaxrees unfortunately, ues.  I'm building this as a POC... and then probably porting it to angular 1.  (angular 2 is too much for me to learn new for now).
[11:39:56] <robertmaxrees> why not consider something more like react and completely avoid all of these issues? :)
[11:40:21] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, it sounds like you just need a refresher on DOM traversal and all that.
[11:41:10] <jerit_> to change value of <input type="hidden" /> one does use $("input[type=hidden]").val("new_value"); correct?
[11:41:18] <Alpha1125> robertmaxrees so many flavours out there... angular 1/2, react, ember, ...... I have no clue what's going to fit my needs.
[11:41:31] <robertmaxrees> jerit sure/.
[11:41:45] <Alpha1125> so, my problem was (still is), I'm able to find the data-uuid, when I start from an child element... but when I'm starting from a global scope, I'm having issues, with selector to find the specific child <tr>.  With "ID", I've now avoided that problem all together.
[11:41:46] <MikeD_> angular one half?  that's not even as good as angular one  :p
[11:41:48] <robertmaxrees> Alpha1125 just tossing the idea out.  imo it's a little strange to build out using jquery just to port it later.
[11:42:21] <robertmaxrees> Alpha1125 you're kind of being vague. are you able to create a super simplified test case?
[11:42:27] <Alpha1125> robertmaxrees agile, get something out fast, if it works, then fix it... if the idea fails, why put too much effort into a proof of concept.
[11:42:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[11:42:51] <robertmaxrees> that's the wrong way to apply that methodology imo, but OK :)
[11:42:56] <MikeD_> yeah, "poc" using a completely different technology isn't much of a proof
[11:43:11] <robertmaxrees> you'll end up spending more time writing the boilerplate than you would otherwise.
[11:43:41] <robertmaxrees> but if you're really set on using jquery for some reason, this should all be relatively simple.
[11:43:50] <jerit_> robertmaxrees: it isn't working :/ http://pastebin.com/qdpJVAnB
[11:44:08] <Alpha1125> okay... IF I actually read... thanks for pointing out my bracket location was wrong. :(
[11:44:12] <robertmaxrees> pastebin makes me gag :)
[11:44:16] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[11:44:26] <Alpha1125> taplar thank you.
[11:44:27] <jerit_> sorry but it was easier than a fiddle :P
[11:44:32] <jerit_> taplar: o/
[11:44:44] <robertmaxrees> jerit except i'm going to need to make a fiddle anyway.
[11:44:48] <robertmaxrees> waste of my time tbqh ;)
[11:44:57] <jerit_> TheDude has left us :( we are not worthy
[11:44:59] <robertmaxrees> also: how are you verifying?
[11:46:18] <robertmaxrees> jerit_ https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3f90mdsy/
[11:46:19] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[11:46:41] <jerit_> I see
[11:46:46] <jerit_> no idea why its not working on my site then
[11:46:53] <robertmaxrees> how are you verifying on your site?
[11:47:24] <robertmaxrees> are the elements getting created dynamically?  are you sure you're binding after the elements exist?  is the handler firing at all?  are there errors?
[11:48:36] <jerit_> robertmaxrees: something was iffy with my selector so I changed it to $("input[type=password]") now it works nicely :)
[11:48:48] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:48:53] <robertmaxrees> you have ids.  use 'emn.
[11:49:03] <robertmaxrees> but alright.  this is why you making a fiddle is good times.
[11:49:38] <jerit_> robertmaxrees: we're talking about asp.net here and that does tend to screw around with things
[11:50:03] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[11:50:05] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[11:50:16] <jerit_> <input type="hidden" name="ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$hdnResetPassword" id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_hdnResetPassword" />
[11:50:18] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't interact with asp - it interacts with html.
[11:50:22] <jerit_> that looks like a really :P
[11:50:29] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[11:50:35] <robertmaxrees> i've had experience.
[11:50:43] <jerit_> that's the rendered ID for the <asp:Hidden> control lol
[11:50:58] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you want to avoid using attribute selectors.
[11:50:59] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[11:51:01] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[11:58:20] <taplar> think of your markup as your your assistant, and your donald trump.  best not to try to touch their attributes.  your probably going to regret it later on
[11:58:46] * taplar drops the mic
[12:01:56] <joaocastanho> Hi
[12:02:01] <joaocastanho> Anyone here knows bootstrap tour?
[12:02:03] <taplar> kon'nichiwa
[12:02:09] <robertmaxrees> i've used it.
[12:02:18] <joaocastanho> I'm in a dilemma
[12:03:01] <taplar> you're on your fourth tour and now you're starting to see johnny in all the trees?
[12:03:26] <joaocastanho> robertmaxrees: I have two different inputs. One for desktop and another for mobile
[12:04:30] * taplar scribbles "media queries" on a piece of paper and folds it up, then waits for the question to unfold
[12:04:43] <joaocastanho> https://thepb.in/p/1jhnr10PvLrHB
[12:04:59] <robertmaxrees> 5 bucks says he needs to dynamically build the json for the tour.
[12:05:22] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho cut to the chase.  what's the coire of your problem?
[12:06:02] <joaocastanho> popover only shows on desktop
[12:06:06] <joaocastanho> because it's the first element
[12:06:30] <taplar> looks like dupe ids to me
[12:06:46] <taplar> if both of those exist on the page at the same time
[12:06:46] <robertmaxrees> ^ do you have both of those loading on the page at the same time.
[12:07:26] <joaocastanho> yes
[12:07:30] <robertmaxrees> can't do that.
[12:07:34] <joaocastanho> they load at the same time
[12:07:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can't repeat IDs.
[12:07:49] <joaocastanho> what about a class?
[12:07:52] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:07:55] <joaocastanho> can I use it for bootstrap tour?
[12:08:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  the json takes selectors.
[12:08:11] <joaocastanho> let me see if it works
[12:08:43] <joaocastanho> Bootstrap Tour 'tour' | Skip the orphan step 3.
[12:08:43] <joaocastanho> Orphan option is false and the element does not exist or is hidden.
[12:08:45] <joaocastanho> :(
[12:08:47] <joaocastanho> even worse
[12:08:55] <joaocastanho> now on desktop and mobile dont work
[12:09:50] <joaocastanho> why?
[12:10:51] <joaocastanho> robertmaxrees: it seems it doesnt handle classes
[12:12:24] <joaocastanho> what else do you suggest?
[12:14:17] <taplar> what is this tour thing?  is it a tutorial?
[12:14:50] <joaocastanho> checkout bootstrap tour
[12:14:54] <joaocastanho> it's like a tutorial, yes
[12:15:10] <taplar> shouldn't they have the info you need to accomplish their stuff then?
[12:15:28] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho that sounds wrong to me.
[12:15:31] <robertmaxrees> let me check.
[12:15:46] <robertmaxrees> show me your json
[12:15:50] <joaocastanho> they dont taplar
[12:16:11] <robertmaxrees> they don't have documentation?
[12:16:12] <robertmaxrees> bs
[12:16:18] <robertmaxrees> http://bootstraptour.com/api/
[12:16:19] <joaocastanho> they have
[12:16:28] <joaocastanho> but they dont have what I want though
[12:16:37] <joaocastanho> you mean tour code? robertmaxrees?
[12:16:38] <robertmaxrees> the ability to select via class?
[12:16:39] <taplar> they don't have, or you haven't found it?
[12:17:10] <taplar> it just seem strange that your asking us for help in completing a tutorial site, :)
[12:17:15] <joaocastanho> Not sure taplar, my idea was to be able to type in two ids, in same element
[12:17:34] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho so you're trying to figure out how to select the correct one.
[12:18:06] <joaocastanho> yes
[12:18:20] <robertmaxrees> so you need to give each one a unique ID.
[12:18:51] <joaocastanho> that was my first attempt, but then you'll need to add two steps , right?
[12:18:56] <robertmaxrees> and then you need to figure out if you're at a desktop breakpoint or a mobile breakpoint.
[12:18:57] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:19:01] <joaocastanho> oh
[12:19:03] <robertmaxrees> you'll dynamically build out that entry.
[12:19:20] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you COULD use both, but in my experience bootstrap tour gets weird in those cases.
[12:19:50] <joaocastanho> okay, so the desktop breakpoint and mobile breakpoint , how?
[12:23:03] <robertmaxrees> search google :)
[12:23:09] <robertmaxrees> there are libraries that'll help.
[12:24:04] <joaocastanho> that will be my only way?
[12:24:19] <joaocastanho> using a breakpoint with js?
[12:25:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd start searching around :)
[12:25:46] <ThatWebGuy> How can I take an array in PHP and use it in jQuery?
[12:26:01] <robertmaxrees> make it jhson.
[12:26:05] <robertmaxrees> ThatWebGuy
[12:26:22] <ThatWebGuy> okay.  I will look at jhson
[12:26:25] <joaocastanho> robertmaxrees answer is always json
[12:26:26] <robertmaxrees> *json
[12:26:38] <taplar> json_encode(theArray)
[12:26:40] <robertmaxrees> iirc php ships with a way to encode something as json.
[12:26:50] <ThatWebGuy> awesome.
[12:27:47] <ThatWebGuy> for example this should in theory work correct? var data = <?php echo json_encode($data); ?>;
[12:28:01] <robertmaxrees> i don't know PHP.
[12:28:13] <taplar> that would error
[12:28:20] <taplar> because you don't have encapsulating quotes
[12:28:38] <taplar> well.... hmm
[12:29:05] <taplar> maybe that will work, but not sure if it will be an object or string at the time the javascript runs
[12:29:35] <robertmaxrees> if it's a string you can just decode it.
[12:33:08] <ThatWebGuy> okay
[12:41:29] <GeekMonkey> I have a client that decided not to host with me... now she is complaining that her site is slow... it is mainly her ajax is ridiculously slow...any suggestions as to what I can tell her to upgrade?
[12:41:59] <robertmaxrees> really difficult to tell.
[12:42:18] <robertmaxrees> what about her ajax is "Slow"?
[12:43:36] <robertmaxrees> that could be network issues, bad code, poorly written backend, etc.
[12:43:38] <shoky> she should upgrade her RAM, cpu, SSD, car, house, life - i'm sure she won't care about her ajax anymore
[12:43:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:49:19] <MikeD_> how do i get a list of what plugins are on the jquery object?
[12:49:29] <robertmaxrees> you can't really.
[12:49:33] <robertmaxrees> you can list out all methods.
[12:50:07] <MikeD_> Object.keys( $.fn )
[12:50:12] <MikeD_> is there a better way?
[12:50:19] <MikeD_> i guess that works
[12:57:13] <joaocastanho> robertmaxrees Know what I used? xD
[12:57:28] <joaocastanho> .submit:visible as the element
[12:57:37] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[12:57:39] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[12:57:48] <joaocastanho> why ew?
[12:58:07] <robertmaxrees> psuedoselectors make mesad.
[12:58:15] <taplar> jQuery has to work hard to evaluate :visible
[12:58:29] <robertmaxrees> but you're kind of SOL unless you prevent one from rendering in the first place.
[12:58:58] <joaocastanho> yeah
[12:59:09] <robertmaxrees> whcih is really what you should do, but meh.
[12:59:11] <joaocastanho> seems the right option for now
[12:59:34] <joaocastanho> what problems will I encounter with :visible?
[12:59:51] <robertmaxrees> if your site isn't done right, you'll have issues on the init for the plugin.
[12:59:53] <taplar> it's just the work it has to do.  visible is more things that just display: none
[12:59:57] <robertmaxrees> because :visible and :hidden can be really hard.
[13:00:13] <robertmaxrees> if it's not slow now, don't worry too much, just be aware for the future.
[13:01:00] <joaocastanho> the performance is the issue
[13:01:01] <joaocastanho> okay
[13:01:04] <taplar> personally i've tried to make it a point to make a class of 'hide' or something that has the display none on it, and then add/remove that instead of doing :visible
[13:01:11] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^
[13:12:30] <z1haze_work> what is the best/quickest way to find an elements index to its parent?
[13:12:42] <z1haze_work> ie, i have a number of child elements and i need to find the index of a particular one
[13:13:36] <robertmaxrees> .index()
[13:14:22] <z1haze_work> so that gives its index to its direct parent?
[13:14:26] <z1haze_work> frm what i can see
[13:14:56] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:42:25] <verax5> What is the best and easiest way to put table inside a Form with checkboxes?
[13:42:31] <robertmaxrees> html.
[13:42:40] <taplar> lol
[13:43:13] <verax5> It should only show when data is retrieved from server
[13:43:31] <verax5> so when user clicks on some links then table/form should show
[13:43:41] <robertmaxrees> show or you want to render it out?
[13:43:53] <verax5> hm idk the difference
[13:44:04] <robertmaxrees> do you need to use the data from the server in some way?
[13:44:15] <robertmaxrees> or do you already have the form when the page loads?
[13:44:53] <verax5> data from server >> to jquery >> to html page >> here user can choose data and delete it
[13:45:08] <robertmaxrees> use a templating engine in that case.
[13:45:32] <verax5> javascript templating engine robert?
[13:45:42] <verax5> im using larave it has blade but thats backend
[13:45:42] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:45:44] <verax5> oh
[13:45:58] <verax5> any recommendations for beginner robert?
[13:45:59] <robertmaxrees> unless you're going to ship html to the browser, which is naother route.
[13:46:05] <flashpoint9> Im a nub at js, working on a project and getting stumped on something. This code http://paste.ofcode.org/3bYgxBeAbn9FgL9tMREgLtq
[13:46:07] <taplar> handlebars, mustache
[13:46:13] <robertmaxrees> do you already have underscore in your project, verax5?
[13:46:34] <taplar> flashpoint9: what's the issue?
[13:46:38] <flashpoint9> the commented code on line 11 works, but the code on 12 breaks all js and has no errors
[13:46:52] <flashpoint9> the var classCheck returns true
[13:47:16] <verax5> idk robert but i can add
[13:47:22] <ZoderUck> hi, uh i who used phantomjs with iframes?
[13:47:24] <verax5> everyone seem to recommend vue
[13:47:36] <robertmaxrees> verax5 that's not a templating engine, but it has one included.
[13:47:39] <robertmaxrees> but that would require more work.
[13:47:42] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 easy
[13:47:51] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm.
[13:48:05] <verax5> robert so ya recommend underscore?
[13:48:24] <robertmaxrees> verax5 nope.
[13:48:43] <robertmaxrees> i recommend whatever templating engine best fits your needs.  underscore includes an okay one.
[13:48:52] <taplar> flashpoint9: define 'breaks all js'
[13:48:52] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 define "breaks all js"
[13:48:55] <taplar> lol
[13:48:59] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[13:49:03] <taplar> fker!
[13:49:12] <flashpoint9> no js is loaded or works anywhere on the page
[13:49:24] <plamb_> when you write a change event handler like this $('#menu').on('change', 'a' function .....
[13:49:27] <flashpoint9> console has no errors
[13:49:30] <verax5> robert i right now dont have any particular need just some basic engine that makes live easier echoing tables forms etc since im using ajax for almost all data retrieval and posting
[13:49:32] <plamb_> how far down the dom tree does it go to look for 'a'
[13:49:33] <taplar> you said line 12 breaks it all
[13:49:35] <taplar> what do you mean?
[13:49:35] <plamb_> just the children?
[13:49:39] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 i'd have to see a test case then.
[13:49:53] <robertmaxrees> plamb any and all descendents of #menu that match <a>
[13:50:46] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 keep it in the channel yo.
[13:51:04] <robertmaxrees> verax5 you have lots of choices.  dust, moustache, handlebars.
[13:51:10] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 please stop pming me yueesh
[13:51:53] <flashpoint9> ok, i didnt know that was considered rude
[13:52:06] <taplar> flashpoint9: put "debugger;" before line 8 and run it
[13:52:15] <taplar> then inspect that element and make sure it does indeed have that class
[13:52:18] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com fwiw.
[13:52:21] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[13:52:35] <robertmaxrees> also: pming me circumvents the entire point of the channel :) taplar's got ya covered.
[13:52:53] <taplar> and you've yet to tell us what 'breaks all js' means
[13:53:31] <flashpoint9> taplar: yes the class is on the element
[13:53:45] <taplar> you see that in the inspector?
[13:53:50] <plamb_> what am i doing wrong here
[13:53:51] <plamb_> https://jsfiddle.net/3zkv3x3x/
[13:54:01] <plamb_> err
[13:54:01] <plamb_> wait
[13:54:05] <plamb_> forgot to add the id lol
[13:54:19] <plamb_> https://jsfiddle.net/3zkv3x3x/1/
[13:54:20] <plamb_> there
[13:54:21] <verax5> one anothher question
[13:54:46] <verax5> when exacty to use tempating? if im using jquery to generate lots of html is it time to start using tempating?
[13:54:49] <verax5> or thats normal?
[13:54:55] <verax5> my code with js and htm seem mess
[13:54:58] <robertmaxrees> plamb invalid code.
[13:55:03] <paulvd> what is tempating?
[13:55:09] <plamb_> ???
[13:55:17] <robertmaxrees> plamb look at your console.
[13:55:24] <robertmaxrees> verax5 if you're manually generating lots of html, use a templating engine.
[13:55:38] <verax5> alright man ill look into alternatives
[13:55:40] <robertmaxrees> paulvd it's a more convenient way to generate html.
[13:55:41] <verax5> thanks alot :)
[13:55:49] <taplar> paulvd: a library that takes in data, along with some html markup and generates the desired markup result that you want to add to your page
[13:56:05] <Uhkis> no, that's templating ;)
[13:56:05] <paulvd> glad I didn't know of that mess then
[13:56:18] <paulvd> LOL. that's what I though too..
[13:56:21] <taplar> isn't that what he asked?
[13:56:27] <taplar> oh, lol
[13:56:28] <taplar> nvm
[13:57:09] <paulvd> verax5: why use that through? :/
[13:57:13] <paulvd> though*
[13:57:15] <plamb_> hmm robertmaxrees still doesn't work
[13:57:16] <plamb_> https://jsfiddle.net/3zkv3x3x/5/
[13:57:28] <taplar> paulvd: you don't want html in your js files
[13:57:30] <verax5> paulvd what what buddy?
[13:57:36] <verax5> use *
[13:57:40] <robertmaxrees> plamb the change event?
[13:57:42] <robertmaxrees> you mean click.
[13:57:44] <Uhkis> plamb_: a's dont have change event
[13:57:47] <taplar> paulvd: you want to separate your logic from your markup
[13:57:53] <plamb_> why is that?
[13:58:02] <robertmaxrees> plamb ... change is fired by inputs.
[13:58:07] <plamb_> ohh
[13:58:08] <robertmaxrees> when you change the value and they lose focus.
[13:58:09] <plamb_> i see
[14:00:14] <plamb_> how would i keep the active class on an <a> after a page loads
[14:00:22] <robertmaxrees> your server.
[14:00:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing it's the current page?
[14:00:34] <plamb_> yes
[14:00:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, your backend should handle that.
[14:00:47] <plamb_> jquery is working right, its just loading a new page
[14:01:11] <verax5> this is how my code looks right now
[14:01:39] * robertmaxrees looks into crystal ball.
[14:01:41] <Uhkis> plamb_: well, you could use localstorage but that's pretty heavy for that
[14:01:42] <robertmaxrees> taplar check it out.
[14:01:49] <taplar> cloudy
[14:01:56] <verax5> robert
[14:01:57] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/AvzSyVjn
[14:02:01] <ZoderUck> hi
[14:02:03] <plamb_> hmm i guess i could copy/paste a script to each new page that will go up and find the related button and add active
[14:02:19] <robertmaxrees> plamb don't use js for this lol.
[14:02:22] <ZoderUck> hello :) i need to read the content of an iframe, but the iframe is loaded with different times
[14:02:35] <robertmaxrees> verax5 what are you asking?
[14:02:41] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck "different times"?
[14:02:45] <taplar> is the iframe referencing a page on the same domain?
[14:02:57] <ZoderUck> yes, different and better times
[14:03:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:03:07] <taplar> lol
[14:03:10] <ZoderUck> better in the way of shorter load time
[14:03:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm so confused.
[14:03:28] <ZoderUck> uh :) yes i mean with better shorter
[14:03:31] <Uhkis> damn, ZoderUck coded a time machine
[14:03:33] <taplar> wtf
[14:03:35] <verax5> robert nothing was just showing the code where im generating html dynamicallly
[14:03:45] <robertmaxrees> verax5 'kay.  thanks?
[14:03:48] <taplar> shorter is never better
[14:03:51] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck your qwuestion makes absolutely new sense lol
[14:03:52] <ZoderUck> Uhkis, i try to lol :)
[14:04:05] <taplar> no matter what she says
[14:04:06] <flashpoint9> taplar: ok so figured it out, earlier I was testing by disabling js via the chrome inspector and it was still off
[14:04:17] <Uhkis> LOL taplar
[14:04:20] <verax5> lol in a context that i was asking about js tempating framework
[14:04:33] <robertmaxrees> verax5 'kay?  i'm still gonna give the same response.
[14:04:38] <ZoderUck> i tried to use phantomjs, it works, well i itterate with normal javascript trough the iframes on the page. but in one of the iframe there is a mpjeg, motion stream, i need to grap that url src
[14:04:57] <taplar> are the contents from the iframe for the same domain?
[14:05:52] <ZoderUck> uh, good question,  i have to compare that . wait i give the url  :)  http://cam-3-8.click2stream.com/
[14:06:00] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:06:10] <taplar> i dont need to look for you to tell me that
[14:06:12] <robertmaxrees> is the domain in th eiframe src the same as the domain you're loading the page on?
[14:06:13] <ZoderUck> i think it is on the click2stream domain, the parent html and the iframe
[14:06:15] <robertmaxrees> you should know.
[14:06:55] <ZoderUck> wait if you look in the back, you see me in the window
[14:07:02] <taplar> *sigh*
[14:07:06] <taplar> so many teeth on the floor
[14:07:07] <robertmaxrees> duder
[14:07:09] <ZoderUck> *hi hi*
[14:07:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:07:23] <ZoderUck> you see me ?
[14:07:24] <mmmveggies> am I going crazy? Why are these variables `undefined` in my console.log http://pastebin.com/v80rBbr8
[14:07:33] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck nobody is going to look at your cam page.
[14:07:44] <ZoderUck> ow ok.
[14:07:45] <robertmaxrees> mmmveggies which variables.
[14:07:51] <taplar> look at the url of your page.  and look at the url on the iframe.  do they both have the same "http://<thispart>/...." ?
[14:08:02] <mmmveggies> `sliverTop` mainly
[14:08:21] <ZoderUck> well it is a timing issue, but ok.  the domain question.  https://mjpeg1-eu5-8.angelcam.com/stream/18679  is the  url src i need to grap.
[14:08:30] <ZoderUck> so angelcam.com versus click2stream.com
[14:08:37] <taplar> then your cross domain
[14:08:44] <taplar> you can't grab the iframe content in that case
[14:08:44] <ZoderUck> ow.
[14:09:01] <ZoderUck> i need a cross domain javascript lib ?
[14:09:07] <taplar> no such thing
[14:09:23] <taplar> the site in the iframe would have to configure itself to allow cross domain for the parent site
[14:09:30] <robertmaxrees> mmmveggies you sure #sliver exists?
[14:09:31] <taplar> it's not a javascript thing
[14:09:40] <mmmveggies> robertmaxrees: positively
[14:10:13] <ZoderUck> taplar, i dont know.  i know with phantomjs it is ieasy to  get the page.content  or use   document.body  and itterate trough all iframes,  but i cannot get the iframes content
[14:10:19] <mmmveggies> robertmaxrees: http://i.imgur.com/lAew8cx.png
[14:10:24] <taplar> i'm telling you the problem
[14:10:29] <robertmaxrees> zidane_g_ are youa sking a jquery question or a phantomjs question>?
[14:10:41] <taplar> you cannot access cross domain content unless the destination server allows it
[14:10:45] <ZoderUck> taplar, ow. it is not a javasript solveable problem ?
[14:10:45] <robertmaxrees> mmmveggies can you make a fiddle?
[14:10:46] <taplar> it's a web standard security measure
[14:10:53] <taplar> no, you cannot solve it with javascript as i've said
[14:11:08] <taplar> if javascript could circumvent it, it wouldn't be a security measure
[14:11:44] <ZoderUck> taplar, and there is realy no way to grap this piece  <img src="https://mjpeg1-eu5-8.angelcam.com/stream/18679?blatoken=whatineed_hehe">
[14:11:53] <taplar> do i need to say it a third time?
[14:12:01] <ZoderUck> if one put the whole img src with correct token in a custompage
[14:12:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:12:22] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck start listening.
[14:12:38] <taplar> i'm trying to remember the website with all the security documents...
[14:12:43] <ZoderUck> ow
[14:13:01] <ZoderUck> taplar you mean this url  belongs to the browser./navigator session ?
[14:13:26] <taplar> owasp!
[14:13:51] <ZoderUck> taplar, i was able to  put that img src url in a bare html page, and let it stream for 1 hour witouth ads,  after a while the token expired
[14:14:19] <ZoderUck> so now i have created an chrome extension to upload /post the token to my site  and serve  the wordpress custom template page
[14:14:39] <ZoderUck> with chrome extension it is done able. with the correct tabblad selected and iframe selected.
[14:14:56] <ZoderUck> it is doneable i mean
[14:15:23] <robertmaxrees> what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
[14:15:25] <ZoderUck> somebody here are you folks warped away ?
[14:15:33] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to put a stream up on another page?
[14:15:38] <ZoderUck> yes
[14:15:39] <robertmaxrees> by copying it from another site?
[14:15:49] <robertmaxrees> so you want to screw them out of ad revenue?
[14:15:50] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:15:53] <ZoderUck> it works, yes. but the  <img src is valid for 1 hour
[14:16:07] <ZoderUck> yea yea, that is mean, but i am not mean you know
[14:16:19] <ZoderUck> mean and lean
[14:16:22] <robertmaxrees> why not just write your own stream host at that point?
[14:16:27] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're costing them money.
[14:16:49] <ZoderUck> i dont have the upload stream of corse, i have only 10Mega bit on this KPN line
[14:17:09] <robertmaxrees> but you own the camera, yes?
[14:17:12] <taplar> seems like you'd be opening yourself to legal problems too if they found out
[14:17:14] <ZoderUck> i understand normally there is 1 or 2 views on that webcam.
[14:17:25] <ZoderUck> o
[14:17:39] <robertmaxrees> they might not care, but it might set a problematic precedent.
[14:18:08] <mmmveggies> robertmaxrees: I was getting `scrollTop` and `offset` mixed up >_< thanks for your help anyway lol
[14:18:24] <robertmaxrees> mmmveggies hah - i should have caught that.
[14:18:25] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[14:18:47] <mmmveggies> you villain D:
[14:18:49] * mmmveggies chuckles
[14:18:55] <ZoderUck> here put this in your browser please https://mjpeg1-eu5-8.angelcam.com/stream/18679?token=eyJjYW1lcmFfaWQiOiIxODY3OSIsInRpbWUiOjE0NzY0NjgzOTcsInRpbWVvdXQiOjM2MDB9.a51ab43c93f40af0d29e93c03f13a02c58d31c36bbb3b1372804b886ccdf6d0c
[14:19:22] <taplar> what kinda 'cam' is this?  most of us are at work duder
[14:19:29] <Uhkis> ZoderUck: your urls are getting scary
[14:19:41] <ZoderUck> this works for 1 hour approx. and after that i have to fire my chrome extension, and click on some bits and tits
[14:19:53] <taplar> yeah, not clicking that
[14:20:04] <ZoderUck> ok, lol
[14:20:48] <ZoderUck> i mean, the chrome extension needs a context, a viewer context. not sure too how this works, got the ccode from internet,  the content.js  is inpridctable. i have to click on some pieces of the page
[14:21:09] <ZoderUck> and that is why i want to do it with phantomjs sandbox
[14:21:58] <ZoderUck> well ok
[14:22:08] <ZoderUck> i think i will try to find a stream duplicator software
[14:22:18] <ZoderUck> the javascript is tough.
[14:23:07] <ZoderUck> taplar you did have a security hacking document ?
[14:23:21] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:23:22] <ZoderUck> for this angelview purpose ?
[14:23:25] <taplar> OWASP has lots of documents about web security and such
[14:23:33] <ZoderUck> aha ok.
[14:23:40] <taplar> my googlefu was failing me on finding the document i wanted
[14:24:21] <ZoderUck> aha ok. i did get the phantomjs tip from a php, it is very new for me
[14:25:46] <ZoderUck> uh question you folks use the  promise options of jquery ? a lot ?
[14:26:11] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck huh?
[14:26:13] <taplar> not directly, but ajax uses it under the hood
[14:26:16] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:26:18] <taplar> personally
[14:26:18] <ZoderUck> aha !! then you might or could help me
[14:26:24] <robertmaxrees> lots of other stuff uses it, too.
[14:26:30] <robertmaxrees> whether or not you;'re using it directly.
[14:26:30] <ZoderUck> aha ok
[14:27:04] <ZoderUck> is  $.ajax  bla deprecated  i did read  $.get and $post is the one people should use ? right for ajax calls
[14:27:11] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:27:12] <taplar> vise versa
[14:27:16] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax() is what you want to use.
[14:27:24] <robertmaxrees> $.get and $.post use $.ajax under the good.
[14:27:26] <ZoderUck> ow ok, then i had some parameters on $.ajax() wrong
[14:27:27] <robertmaxrees> *hood
[14:27:44] <ZoderUck> aha thanks, ok
[14:27:55] <ZoderUck> it is a bit frustrationg, a chain of unknown unkknowns
[14:27:56] <ZoderUck> lol
[14:27:59] <Uhkis> you tried "sync: true" ?
[14:28:06] <Uhkis> or is it async: false?
[14:28:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:28:10] <robertmaxrees> never use that.
[14:28:13] <robertmaxrees> never never never.
[14:28:14] <ZoderUck> wh me, no. i dont know nothing unfortunatly
[14:28:22] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck what's your question?
[14:28:38] <ZoderUck> uh nothing more at this moment,  how do i come out of my depression
[14:28:42] <Uhkis> iirc that throws some deprecated or other exception on chrome
[14:28:43] <ZoderUck> lol
[14:28:46] <robertmaxrees> ....
[14:28:48] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:28:56] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:28:57] <ZoderUck> forget it thanks,
[14:29:11] <ZoderUck> o yes last question
[14:29:26] <Uhkis> try some exercise? :D
[14:29:37] <ZoderUck> typescript was inventded to make types scrict in javascript.  is it used in the industry?
[14:29:44] <robertmaxrees> in some places, yes.
[14:29:48] <robertmaxrees> but it does much more than that.
[14:29:56] <robertmaxrees> it adds static typing to js.
[14:30:00] <robertmaxrees> as well as some other features.
[14:30:09] <robertmaxrees> some things use it, others use flow, others don't use either.
[14:30:31] <ZoderUck> aha, on training videos the  new languages and features like promises look so nice, but coding a real  problem to solve is , tough
[14:30:44] <robertmaxrees> not tough at all.
[14:30:55] <ZoderUck> ok, i will over couple of minutes will try the typescript
[14:31:26] <Uhkis> promises are nice, you dont even have to keep them in js!
[14:31:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:31:55] <ZoderUck> well ok, i have coded this. http://www.strongfit.nl/wp-content/themes/betheme/sf-pages/sf-tdee-calculator/js/form-tdee-calc-script_v2.js?ver=2
[14:32:05] <ZoderUck> but no high tech patterns excelt the revaling pattern
[14:32:10] <ZoderUck> except
[14:32:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:32:17] <robertmaxrees> jesus christ.
[14:32:20] <ZoderUck> i have tough to detect the promises etc
[14:32:38] <ZoderUck> robert, apparently you dont like urls ?
[14:32:45] <robertmaxrees> that's a whole lot of code.
[14:32:52] <ZoderUck> yes people did say that too
[14:33:01] <robertmaxrees> and a lot of shared state.
[14:33:02] <ZoderUck> too much code for a validation of some 9 fields
[14:33:12] <robertmaxrees> holy shit really?>
[14:33:19] <robertmaxrees> this is just for some form validation?
[14:33:53] <ZoderUck> yes, what would you use in a next version. AngularJS or mustache, something ?
[14:33:58] <ZoderUck> some modelview binder ?
[14:34:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:34:05] <ZoderUck> backend is php, you did understand?
[14:34:12] <robertmaxrees> better coidng practices.
[14:34:18] <ZoderUck> i am new to the js stuff
[14:34:28] <robertmaxrees> i can tell.
[14:34:43] <taplar> i'm shocked
[14:35:03] <ZoderUck> is, but the stuff was needed to process the  json stuff from the php
[14:35:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:35:25] <robertmaxrees> you just need more practice, that's all.
[14:36:48] <ZoderUck> what would you use to select a dom element, the thing is , i needf   form.oneOf15_fields_didchange_,  this whole code is due to   a data-previous-value   i need to assign
[14:36:55] <ZoderUck> i keep track of a form change.
[14:37:09] <robertmaxrees> wut.
[14:37:16] <robertmaxrees> $() is pretty good for selecting.
[14:37:17] <ZoderUck> and that is why i did need to select every  dom element, i put a  data-previous-value  in the dom element
[14:37:19] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're asking.
[14:37:26] <robertmaxrees> why are you holding prior values?
[14:37:53] <ZoderUck> i need for 20 fields.  several types,   input, textarea, input checkbox, ,  a change detection
[14:37:57] <taplar> i've yet to run across a use case for selecting 'every' dom element
[14:38:12] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck you're really conflating how this works.
[14:38:24] <jbeeze> what robertmaxrees, said about selecting.  there's a reason it's called j "QUERY" ;)
[14:38:42] <ZoderUck> i needed a features,  form.didchange    and i did iemplent this in the  data-prev-value  attrib
[14:39:00] <ZoderUck> but maybe i should put a normal array.
[14:39:15] <ZoderUck> i dont have a prblem with custom selectors
[14:39:23] <ZoderUck> the problem here is lot of code
[14:39:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:39:27] <jbeeze> are you just sending over one form's contents?
[14:39:29] <taplar> small example of the problem would be suuuuper helpful
[14:39:30] <jbeeze> have you tried .serialize() ?
[14:39:46] <ZoderUck> jbeeze, yes correct all the contens, plus extra serialised fields. yes
[14:39:53] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck you're really getting abstract here.  you realize there are entire libraries that exist to validate forms, right?
[14:39:57] <ZoderUck> but i need to detect  a difference, before i send a new post
[14:40:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:40:17] <ZoderUck> robert, i heart later there are jquery validation libs yes, not used them.
[14:40:24] <taplar> in the `event` of a change you want to do a post?
[14:40:25] <robertmaxrees> use them.
[14:40:31] <robertmaxrees> taplar :D
[14:40:33] <ZoderUck> but what strategy you would choose,  not frontend validation, just post the bunch ?
[14:40:41] <robertmaxrees> both.
[14:40:46] <robertmaxrees> frontend and backend.
[14:40:52] <ZoderUck> hmn
[14:41:06] <ZoderUck> i need to dive into jquery validation library, did not use it yet ever
[14:41:10] <taplar> i think fridays bring out my scarcasm
[14:41:17] <taplar> sarcasm?
[14:41:18] <taplar> lol
[14:41:49] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:41:49] <jbeeze> do front end validation to make sure what you're sending over with ajax or whatever, is validated enough to then be validated enough on the backend
[14:41:53] <ZoderUck> but the frontend validation,   test the difference  previous post and current state of the form.
[14:41:57] <jbeeze> that way you limit the amount of requests youre doing
[14:42:00] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck why?
[14:42:14] <taplar> ZoderUck: what frontend "validation" do you need?  From what i've read your only interested if something changed
[14:42:28] <ZoderUck> robert, because, if there is a change, i will do a server php call. some people did not change nothing.
[14:42:36] <ZoderUck> maybe i could drop that feature yes.
[14:42:45] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck or you change your thought process.
[14:42:53] <robertmaxrees> you know there's an event for changed fields, right?
[14:43:09] <ZoderUck> uh, there is indeed
[14:43:15] <robertmaxrees> then use it
[14:43:19] <jbeeze> maybe put the input into a hidden field, and check, if the certain field you're comparing to is changed via the onBlur event
[14:43:20] <ZoderUck> aha ok.
[14:43:25] <robertmaxrees> no need for data attributes to hold all that when the browser handles all of it for you.
[14:43:50] <ZoderUck> jbeeze, i already do that, the attrib is i think data-previous  something
[14:43:59] <ZoderUck> it hink i should drop that strategie
[14:44:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, literally no reason for that.
[14:44:33] <ZoderUck> o, also i have 3 layouts,
[14:44:44] <ZoderUck> so duplicate names 3 times an input checkbox :)
[14:44:54] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn abstraction.
[14:45:12] <ZoderUck> i was not able to  put 3 layouts into 1 , was too difficult
[14:45:15] <robertmaxrees> but a simple change event handler should be able to do like 99% of what you're trying to it.
[14:45:19] <robertmaxrees> *to do
[14:45:30] <taplar> done right, javascript does not care about the layout
[14:45:39] <ZoderUck> of course i do use on change, -> 3 input name elemnts updating
[14:45:49] <robertmaxrees> you're overcom,plicating all of this lol
[14:46:06] <ZoderUck> you folks tell me the obvious and no solutions.
[14:46:09] <ZoderUck> lol
[14:46:16] <taplar> $(formSelector).on('change', 'input, select, textarea', function(){ ... });
[14:46:17] <robertmaxrees> we gave you a solution.
[14:46:25] <ZoderUck> tablar i already do that
[14:46:27] <ZoderUck> in the code
[14:46:37] <taplar> so what's the prob?
[14:46:40] <robertmaxrees> you realize change only fires if... som,ethign changed, right?
[14:46:42] <ZoderUck> jquery updats all the items in the collections
[14:47:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:47:12] <ZoderUck> well forget it, i need to change the layout from 3 to 1, that will reduce some input elements
[14:48:44] <taplar> so your problem is too many input elements?
[14:49:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:49:12] <taplar> ;)
[14:49:38] <jbeeze> at this point, im all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[14:49:58] <taplar> dude, you need some protein
[14:50:21] <taplar> all boney armed there
[14:55:14] * taplar glances around before bookmarking the anglecam link for later
[14:55:36] <Frustijs> aha !! you looked on my cam ?
[14:55:46] <taplar> wut?  huh? me?
[14:55:47] <robertmaxrees> D:
[14:55:58] <robertmaxrees> people with cams bother me.
[14:56:13] <taplar> nah nah man.  i'm just really into cinematography
[14:56:21] <Frustijs> :)
[14:57:13] <taplar> i only watch it for the articles
[14:57:20] <taplar> clothing articles
[14:57:27] <taplar> ya know, i'm in the clothing biz
[15:00:05] <robertmaxrees> aaaand finally lunch time.
[15:00:18] <Frustijs> who have heard about Embedded WB ?
[15:00:24] <d4rklit3> hi
[15:00:29] <Frustijs> hi
[15:00:34] <taplar> bon'jour
[15:00:48] <d4rklit3> is there a bug with $.offset() not being consistent with chrome/firefox
[15:01:06] <d4rklit3> on chrome it seems to give me offset from scrollTop and then on firefox its offsetfrom page top
[15:01:18] <Frustijs> uh
[15:01:55] <taplar> $(someElement).offset() ?
[15:02:07] <d4rklit3> yes
[15:02:26] <taplar> what jQuery version?
[15:02:28] <d4rklit3> 3
[15:02:50] <d4rklit3> 3.1
[15:02:56] <ZoderUck> $.(hello_3.1)
[15:03:05] <ZoderUck> :)
[15:03:10] <d4rklit3> what?
[15:03:18] <ZoderUck> o nothing, just a joke
[15:04:27] <taplar> yeah, they appear to be different
[15:04:53] <d4rklit3> 2 seems more consistent
[15:04:59] <d4rklit3> i guess i'll use that
[15:05:06] <d4rklit3> stupid :(
[15:13:04] <taplar> gah, i wanna play ps3
[15:21:23] <MikeD_> ps3?
[15:21:30] <taplar> playstation 3
[15:24:42] <taplar> i just recently picked up borderlands 1 again and my addiction is back
[15:31:19] <GeekMonkey> Hey all
[15:31:31] <taplar> aloha
[15:31:54] <robertLunch> goooooooood afternoon
[15:31:56] <GeekMonkey> I am running this script for a smooth carousel on my site... there is no console errors... it works in codepen but does not work on my WP site
[15:32:08] <GeekMonkey> any thoughts or ideas to debug this
[15:32:18] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not filtering out messages.
[15:32:23] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're loading things in the right error.
[15:33:27] <taplar> also WP does the whole no conflict thing so make sure your taking that into consideration
[15:33:35] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[15:34:09] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KU3fjGcqexBcE1u2HWc
[15:34:19] <GeekMonkey> This is my JS
[15:37:30] <taplar> which part isn't working?  kinda hard to follow the whole thing
[15:37:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:37:39] <robertmaxrees> berb
[15:37:50] <taplar> side note, i do see a nested docready
[15:40:04] <GeekMonkey> It works on codepen but on my site with does not move at all
[15:40:12] <GeekMonkey> the hover doesn't work either
[15:40:34] <GeekMonkey> all the images load from instagram
[15:41:19] <taplar> ln 94 looks weird
[15:42:29] <taplar> isn't that just sticking the object from above in it?
[15:45:33] <taplar> also did you check your network tab to make sure it's making that ajax request and what it's response code and data is?
[15:45:53] <GeekMonkey> taplar: no did not check ajax request
[15:54:11] <GeekMonkey> It seems like this function instagram_feed.done(function() { is not running
[15:54:36] <taplar> which would suggest the ajax is not returning a success response
[15:55:01] <taplar> thus me asking if you checked the network tab
[15:58:21] <GeekMonkey> it looks like it is loading
[15:58:25] <GeekMonkey> and I put a console.log('Do Scrolly');
[15:58:56] <GeekMonkey> in the scrolly function which loaded that log hundreds of times so I know that function is working
[15:59:10] <GeekMonkey> I even added
[15:59:11] <GeekMonkey> instagram_feed.done(function() {
[15:59:21] <GeekMonkey> and I saw that in the console log
[15:59:29] <GeekMonkey> but the slider still does not move
[16:37:13] <ExeciN> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/836a182bd0792f6d2ebae35a4661bdc0 line 1 should be adding a div right before the element with id of products, line 2 should be giving it an attribute of class="product-option"
[16:37:38] <ExeciN> It doesn't work though. No changes are made to the dom. What am I doing wrong?
[16:39:09] <shoky> ExeciN: don't know without seeing a testcase, but it's better to do something like:  var div = $('<div>').addClass('product-option');  $('#products').before(div);
[16:42:25] <ExeciN> shoky: It still doesn't work. Is it because the div is empty?
[16:43:40] <shoky> ExeciN: i can't know without seeing it for myself. make a jsfiddle..   your code works fine - https://jsfiddle.net/wp31kcfb/1/
[16:48:07] <ExeciN> shoky: PEBKAC, my selector was wrong
[16:52:10] <shoky> jsfiddles are the best cure for those
[18:32:59] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[18:37:39] <verax5> How ugly is my code?
[18:37:39] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/MF3kh2bN
[18:38:20] <robertmaxrees> learn to use anything other than pastebin for starters ;)
[18:39:30] <robertmaxrees> coupla notes:
[18:39:39] <robertmaxrees> avoid using ajaxsetup.
[18:39:51] <verax5> wait wait wait!!
[18:39:52] <robertmaxrees> don't use for loops.
[18:39:56] <verax5> wait!!! lol
[18:40:00] <robertmaxrees> use promisest/
[18:40:13] <verax5> what d ya mean learning to use anything other than pastebin?
[18:40:23] <robertmaxrees> use bpaste
[18:40:26] <robertmaxrees> or anmything else.
[18:40:42] <robertmaxrees> pastebin has too many ads and shitty spam detection.
[18:40:51] <verax5> ohhh
[18:40:52] <verax5> nvm
[18:40:54] <verax5> sorry
[18:41:00] <robertmaxrees> also: learn about vars and scoping.
[18:41:21] <robertmaxrees> return requestDeleteUsers(deleteUserIds);
[18:41:27] <robertmaxrees> and don't do stuff like this in event handler.
[18:41:30] <robertmaxrees> *handlers.
[18:41:57] <robertmaxrees> also: most people don't quote keynames in js when passing options to things like ajax.
[18:42:15] <verax5> right right
[18:42:17] <robertmaxrees> var deleteUserIds = $('input[type=checkbox]:checked').map(function(key, value) {
[18:42:27] <robertmaxrees> literally no reason to pass those args to the callback because you don't use them.
[18:42:35] <robertmaxrees> same with error: function(hr, status, error) {
[18:42:51] <robertmaxrees> $('span#clickedUser').click(function() { - it's an ID, drop the tagname,
[18:43:05] <robertmaxrees> etc
[18:43:25] <robertmaxrees> and get an editor that autoformats for you.
[18:44:06] <verax5> auto formats what robert, the code?
[18:44:12] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:45:28] <verax5> im using jquery with vue right now
[18:45:41] <verax5> noting error on this code
[18:45:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:45:53] <robertmaxrees> you mean "nothing"?
[18:46:07] <ZoderUck> if i have 66 divs , how do i remove the div block of number 64 ?
[18:46:25] <verax5> oh no noting as in taking notes of mistakes
[18:46:27] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck call remove() on it.
[18:46:44] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck you mean how do you get #64?
[18:46:47] <ZoderUck> ow. this way div[63].remove ?
[18:47:03] <robertmaxrees> try searching google.
[18:47:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:47:07] <robertmaxrees> jquery get element by index
[18:47:11] <robertmaxrees> that's a good search query
[18:47:15] <ZoderUck> mydivs = jQuery("div");
[18:47:29] <ZoderUck> not good ?
[18:47:43] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck huh?
[18:47:53] <ZoderUck> jQuery("document.windows.div")
[18:47:55] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck why are you removing elements by index?  give me more to work with here.
[18:47:57] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:48:04] <robertmaxrees> jQuery("document.windows.div") is a big no :)
[18:48:10] <ZoderUck> o
[18:48:13] <robertmaxrees> you should check out learn.jquery.com
[18:48:14] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[18:48:29] <ZoderUck> because i do know that ads are in that div
[18:48:33] <ZoderUck> i want to remove the add
[18:48:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:48:58] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[18:49:09] <robertmaxrees> are you still trying to remove the advertisements from that page?
[18:49:25] <robertmaxrees> the one that's hosting your cam or w/e?
[18:49:45] <ZoderUck> this -> in the paste it was possible to put a page into a iframe WITH adds, i find adds fine. but if i could put it in an iframe, https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Video/Click2stream-not-working-anymore-for-me/td-p/361797
[18:50:13] <ZoderUck> click2stream is not working for everybody no more
[18:50:27] <ZoderUck> yes
[18:50:30] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you're trying to circumvent their monetization strategy.
[18:50:33] <ZoderUck> come on i want to remove th div
[18:50:34] <robertmaxrees> we're not going to help you do that.
[18:50:36] <ZoderUck> let me remove the div
[18:50:57] <ZoderUck> add addict
[18:51:01] <ZoderUck> i will find it out myself
[18:51:04] <robertmaxrees> great.
