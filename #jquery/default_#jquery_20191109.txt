[06:52:56] <relipse> I have a database table [id, shortname, name, priority] for categories, is there a drag-droppable form input that would set the priority so when it inputs it would input in a given order?
[06:53:10] <relipse> kind of like a sortable

[10:06:15] <TeddyMurray> hi friends
[13:55:34] <adder> hello, I'm trying to get slideDown() to work but having no success, what is the issue? https://codepen.io/lbastos/pen/wvvXNma
[14:09:19] <shoky> adder: remove the  `height: 0` from .submenu
[14:09:53] <adder> thanks shoky
[14:09:57] <shoky> usually better to use css transitions for this
[14:10:27] <adder> the issue here with css transition is I can't apply transition to 100% and I don't know beforehand how height the submenu will be
[14:10:38] <adder> and I didn't like animating max-height workaround
[14:10:44] <adder> do you have any other suggestions?
[14:13:00] <adder> how high*
[14:13:36] <shoky> adder ya you're right, forgot that issue applies here
[14:14:14] <adder> ok so then jquery it is
[14:14:19] <adder> thanks for the help, much appreciated!
