[01:16:30] <Lyze> Hello c: I have a problem with http://web.skype.com ... there I injected jquery via the console and want to send a message via it. I tried to $('textarea').val('test'); and it writes it into the textarea but the "Send" button doesn't get unlocked
[01:35:22] <JosefDe> Hi guys. Can anyone tell me why this little peace of code is not working?: https://jsfiddle.net/ebm9yayw/1/
[01:35:43] <JosefDe> I'm trying to pass the event-object to my method, but get the error: "SyntaxError: missing ] after element list"
[01:39:25] <JosefDe> anyone an idea?
[01:42:40] <phiz> JosefDe: you don't have a body
[01:42:45] <phiz> and there are syntax errors
[01:43:25] <JosefDe> phiz: What do you mean with "don't have a body"? I am referencing to the function "button1clicked", which has a body
[01:43:26] <phiz> https://jsfiddle.net/ebm9yayw/2/
[01:43:38] <phiz> well you don't have a body in your example
[01:43:46] <phiz> so you can't use the body selector
[01:44:17] <JosefDe> phiz: Your suggestion isn't appliable to my problem. I intentionally are trying to execute with "new Function()"
[01:44:45] <JosefDe> phiz: So I'm trying to dynamically call the function
[01:44:56] <JosefDe> phiz: What do you mean with "body"?
[01:45:04] <phiz> you have no <body> tag in your html.
[01:45:09] <JosefDe> so?
[01:45:13] <phiz> so jQuery("body") will not match anything
[01:45:30] <voodo> phiz
[01:45:33] <voodo> u're wrong
[01:45:38] <voodo> u always have a body
[01:45:49] <phiz> ok, must be the other syntax that is messing it up then
[01:46:01] <voodo> what's the problem?
[01:46:14] <phiz> http://jsfiddle.net/ebm9yayw/1/ is his code
[01:46:22] <JosefDe> voodo: Hi. The problem is, that I'm trying to pass an event "object" to the dynamically called function
[01:46:37] <JosefDe> voodo: But then I get this error: "SyntaxError: missing ] after element list"
[01:47:06] <JosefDe> Only if I pass a simple type like string as parameter, I don't get any error
[01:48:20] <voodo> ok 1 minute
[01:48:23] <JosefDe> ok
[01:50:06] <AdamPDotty> You use clickEvent as string
[01:50:40] <JosefDe> AdamPDotty: I'm only trying to pass my event to my function.
[01:51:03] <JosefDe> AdamPDotty: I also tried doing JSON.stringify() and then JSON.parse() on my event-object, but that leads to other errors
[01:53:29] <Lyze> Hehe dunno if you can help me but it's worth asking c: problem with http://web.skype.com ... there I injected jquery via the console and want to send a message via it. I tried $('textarea').val('test'); and it writes it into the textarea. That's working but the "Send" button doesn't get unlocked which means I can't send anything. When I manually unlock it via disable=false then its still not clickable
[01:56:19] <JosefDe> Isn't it possible to pass an event-object to "new Function()"?
[01:56:39] <Cork> Lyze: $('textarea').trigger('change')
[01:56:50] <Cork> or .trigger('keyup')
[01:57:19] <Cork> JosefDe: you mean scope inherit the event object?
[01:57:39] <Lyze> both triggers don't work
[01:57:44] <JosefDe> Cork: What do you mean?
[01:57:49] <AdamPDotty> https://jsfiddle.net/ebm9yayw/7/
[01:57:49] <Kartagis> Cork: do you remember the nodes[0].node.field_x thing the other day?
[01:58:03] <Cork> Lyze: hmm you could also try trigger('input') and trigger('keydown')
[01:58:17] <Lyze> nop
[01:58:19] <Lyze> Cork
[01:58:22] <Cork> JosefDe: what do you mean by "pass an event-object"
[01:58:31] <Cork> Lyze: then you have to check what event handler the page uses
[01:58:46] <Cork> Kartagis: if you have a question just ask it
[01:58:46] <AdamPDotty> Cork: he means myFunction(clickEvent);
[01:58:51] <JosefDe> AdamPDotty: Wow. Let me try that
[01:59:12] <Lyze> Cork: data-bind="value: messageBody, event: { keypress: handleKeyPress, keydown: handleKeyDown, input: handleInput, focus: onFocus, blur: onBlur, paste: onPaste }"
[01:59:38] <Lyze> Cork: I don't know what data-binds are … can't find information's about them on google ... but I guess that's why nothing works
[01:59:40] <Cork> JosefDe, AdamPDotty: why on earth are you using new Function?
[02:00:12] <AdamPDotty> hehe thats the part I did not get yet.
[02:00:20] <AdamPDotty> But he so wanted it.
[02:00:28] <Cork> Lyze: uhh, a google field huh?
[02:00:53] <Lyze> Cork: Hmm?
[02:01:02] <Cork> Lyze: looks like you need to trigger keypress, keydown, input, focus and blur
[02:01:12] <Cork> good luck with that
[02:01:33] <Cork> you would have to check each of those functions and check what they expect
[02:01:41] <Cork> and trigger there events with the correct values
[02:02:04] <Cork> JosefDe: could you explain why you need this?
[02:02:15] <Cork> JosefDe: you normally should avoid eval if you don't absolute need it
[02:02:30] <Kartagis> https://paste.debian.net/311289/ <--- I have this. how do I get all instances or field_fotograflar.src? run a loop?
[02:02:43] <Lyze> Cork: Urgh that will be funny ... /s
[02:02:44] <Cork> Kartagis: yes
[02:02:59] <voodo> JosefDe it works
[02:02:59] <Cork> Lyze: ya, i've done it, it isn't fun
[02:03:12] <Kartagis> Cork: but how do I do that in an ajax call?
[02:03:12] <voodo> but there is a an error in console
[02:03:17] <voodo> im figuring out what it is
[02:03:23] <voodo> https://jsfiddle.net/ebm9yayw/5/
[02:03:33] <Cork> Kartagis: just do a .map or .each on the field_fotograflar
[02:04:07] <AdamPDotty> voodo: function body should be string
[02:04:58] <AdamPDotty> you are using the result of a function you define four lines later
[02:06:18] <Cork> ya, what happens there is that you execute the buttonClick function
[02:06:27] <Cork> then grab the return (undefined) from that
[02:06:47] <Cork> and tries to convert that to a string and use that as a body for the function (and that fails) => SyntaxError: malformed formal parameter
[02:06:48] <voodo> cool
[02:07:10] <Cork> you don't see the error as alert pauses the js engine
[02:07:16] <Cork> (you shouldn't use alert for debugging)
[02:07:29] <voodo> like thi sthwn
[02:07:30] <voodo> it works
[02:07:31] <voodo> https://jsfiddle.net/ebm9yayw/10/
[02:07:49] <Cork> no it doesn't
[02:08:03] <Cork> 7 is the correct solution if you need to use new Function
[02:08:12] <Cork> you just executing the function
[02:08:24] <Cork> you could just as well remove the new Function() part
[02:08:27] <Cork> it isn't ever used
[02:08:30] <voodo> what's
[02:08:33] <voodo> the goal there
[02:08:42] <voodo> pass the scope + event to the function?
[02:08:44] <Cork> he wants to create a new function that calls the function
[02:08:45] <JosefDe> ?
[02:08:52] <JosefDe> What's the problem?
[02:09:14] <Cork> $.fn.jQueryRun = new Function('clickEvent', 'buttonClick(clickEvent')
[02:09:35] <JosefDe> Cork:?
[02:09:36] <Cork> is the same as $.fn.jQueryRun = function(clickEvent) { buttonClick(clickEvent) }
[02:09:44] <Cork> JosefDe: why do you need to use new Function?
[02:09:54] <Cork> it is normally a REALLY bad idea
[02:10:02] <voodo> not getting why
[02:10:05] <voodo> u using new function
[02:10:07] <voodo> at this point
[02:10:07] <Cork> it is very slow as the parser can't optimize them
[02:10:17] <JosefDe> Because normally I don't know the function name
[02:10:27] <Cork> JosefDe: ok?
[02:10:31] <JosefDe> The function name get's passed in as parameter
[02:10:44] <Cork> JosefDe: could you modify how the function name gets passed in?
[02:10:58] <Cork> or how the function gets declared
[02:11:05] <JosefDe> No
[02:11:14] <JosefDe> I store the function name in "data-action" of my html-elements
[02:11:17] <Cork> so they pass in the function as a string?
[02:11:24] <Cork> are the functions globals?
[02:11:25] <JosefDe> And if I click on that element I read that data-action-attribute
[02:11:38] <Cork> meaning are they defined in the global name scope?
[02:11:39] <JosefDe> The functions are stored in jQuery.fn
[02:11:56] <Cork> one min
[02:11:59] <JosefDe> ok
[02:12:10] <JosefDe> I still don't understand what's wrong about the solution of voodo
[02:13:27] <Cork> JosefDe: would you say this represents what you need? https://jsfiddle.net/ebm9yayw/11/
[02:13:44] <Cork> it sounded like what you asked for
[02:13:52] <JosefDe> It doesn't work
[02:14:11] <Cork> AH, missed the 1
[02:14:54] <Cork> JosefDe: https://jsfiddle.net/ebm9yayw/12/
[02:15:17] <Cork> or simply https://jsfiddle.net/ebm9yayw/14/
[02:15:37] <Cork> depending on what you need it for
[02:16:05] <JosefDe> Cork: Perfect! I'm applying it to my project. Thanks a lot guys!
[02:16:24] <Cork> another evil use removed :)
[02:16:26] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/8bmhb5zm/1/ <--- am I even a little close?
[02:16:50] <Cork> Kartagis: no... :)
[02:17:07] <Kartagis> durn
[02:17:24] <JosefDe> So with "new Function" it wouldn't work right?
[02:17:27] <Kartagis> can you throw a pointer at me?
[02:18:17] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/8bmhb5zm/2/
[02:18:47] <Cork> JosefDe: it would, but would 1. be slow, 2. be more insecure, 3. more complicated then needed
[02:18:57] <JosefDe> Cork: Ok :)
[02:19:10] <Kartagis> thanks man, this I will use :)
[02:26:41] <DRSK> http://www.appelsiini.net/download/jquery.viewport.js <-- how would I add a function to expand "inviewport" but also centered on screen?
[03:46:01] <tuskkk___> how do we debug the scenarios, in one case the fancy box delete confirm works as intended, in another case the page just reloads
[03:46:27] <tuskkk___> with case I mean, getting to hit that method directly or after some already done call
[04:04:31] <dimi1947> I want one advice...do you think the search results link of a site...upon clicking...the content should be fetched with AJAX or not?
[04:12:00] <VictorCL> dimi1947 depends on your layout
[04:12:09] <VictorCL> is all up to you
[04:12:30] <VictorCL> do you want to refresh the whole page or just the results?
[04:12:39] <VictorCL> is the question you have to ask yourself
[04:22:26] <clocKwize> Hi, I've got a grid of squares (ul with li's floated left) I'm trying to make it so when I click and drag it highlights those within the imaginary rectangle of the mouse drag. Coming across some problems though
[04:23:19] <clocKwize> e.pageX - $(e.currentTarget).offset().left (pageY/.top for Y) gets the mouse position relative to the UL, but I can't seem to get the proper position of each LI relative to the parent
[04:23:36] <clocKwize> $square.position seems to return odd numbers nothing like I expect
[04:23:38] <dimi1947> I want the user be transfered to a different page upon clicking a result....I assume that means no AJAX
[04:23:55] <dimi1947> VictorCL
[04:24:28] <VictorCL> dimi1947 nope
[04:24:43] <dimi1947> explain please...
[04:25:08] <VictorCL> well if you want to send users to another page .. then you use action='' to that page .. the whole page will refresh
[04:25:39] <VictorCL> u use ajax when you want current content to be updated without refreshing the whole page
[04:25:44] <VictorCL> which is not ur case
[04:25:48] <dimi1947> I understand
[04:27:37] <khurram> hi all
[04:27:57] <taplar> yo
[04:28:27] <Guest39256> is $ jQuery]
[04:28:39] <Guest39256> is $ jQuery[0] correct ?
[04:28:40] <Uhkis> only if $ = jQuery()
[04:28:49] <taplar> no
[04:28:54] <taplar> $ === jQuery
[04:29:00] <Guest39256> no
[04:29:06] <Uhkis> taplar: only if $ = jQuery()
[04:29:10] <taplar> if you don't have the no conflict mode on
[04:29:20] <Cork> Uhkis: $ is never jQuery()
[04:29:37] <Uhkis> it's only jQuery?
[04:29:40] <Cork> yes
[04:29:47] <Guest39256> okay
[04:29:48] <Guest39256> thanks
[04:29:55] <Cork> if it was jQuery() it would be the return value from jQuery()
[04:30:14] <Uhkis> riight
[04:30:39] <Uhkis> and $() wouldn't make any sense either
[04:31:18] <Cork> you would have to do $.find() in that case :)
[04:31:35] <Uhkis> unless function can return a function?
[04:31:42] <Cork> it can
[04:31:49] <Cork> but it isn't what jQuery does
[04:31:53] <Uhkis> js can really be weird :D
[04:32:09] <taplar> whole revealer patter revolves around returning functions, :)
[04:32:28] <Cork> js> function me() { return function() { return 'Yes it is'; } }; print(me()())
[04:32:33] <b-ot> Cork: Yes it is
[04:33:08] <Uhkis> ()() must be called "the boob operator" :D
[04:33:14] <Cork> heh
[04:33:24] <taplar> or b*** cheaks
[04:33:40] <taplar> i see we prefer different things, lmao
[04:33:48] <Uhkis> taplar: haha
[04:35:50] <taplar> it's kinda close to the IIFE though, but a step away
[04:36:15] <taplar> and it's named, :/
[04:36:22] <taplar> 2 steps
[04:42:32] <tuskkk___> unable to debug why the page is reloading after a callback
[04:42:44] <tuskkk___> having a hardtime, any suggestions?
[04:43:01] <Kamuela> I love knowing so absolutely little about CSS. I feel like it makes me special
[04:44:09] <taplar> tuskkk___: we'd need to see an example
[04:45:47] <Uhkis> yeah, it's even harder with only a vague description ;)
[04:46:08] <Kamuela> how slow would it be to add a class to a few elements during the initial load?
[04:46:20] <taplar> not much
[04:46:35] <Uhkis> not at all, but why not do it statically?
[04:46:39] <Kamuela> I'm thinking of doing an above-the-fold class generated by initial width
[04:46:42] <tuskkk___> taplar: cant reproduce it with smaller code
[04:47:15] <Uhkis> ?g css device-width
[04:47:16] <b-ot> Uhkis: CSS media queries: width versus device-width - JavaScript Kit → http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/cssmediaqueries2.shtml
[04:47:37] <Kamuela> right, but generating both the js and styles for any class that happens to be above the fold
[04:47:41] <Kamuela> depending on width
[04:47:43] <taplar> tuskkk___: what event is the callback handling?  what is the callback doing?  more details please
[04:48:09] <Kamuela> especially if there's a nice bit of introductory content to focus on for the remaining 3 or 4 seconds
[04:52:15] <WG1337> Hi! I use jquery .load to get contents of a PHP page. The PHP page can return a lot of data, but what does jquery .load() status expect? From where does it get if status is error or ok?
[04:52:46] <taplar> it should be based on the http response code
[04:54:03] <mission712> I'm a shill kline me plz
[04:55:03] <Uhkis> WG1337: you're better off using .get() or .ajax()
[04:55:31] <WG1337> Uhkis, why is that?
[04:56:31] <WG1337> taplar, yes, you were right, it reads from header repsonse code. Thanks!
[04:56:50] <Uhkis> WG1337: you get more options for handling those situations
[04:57:57] <tuskkk___> taplar: called the person who wrote that code, and he solved it in 5 secs
[04:58:14] <taplar> even better
[04:58:21] <Uhkis> well that's not surprising at all
[04:58:43] <taplar> did he explain to you what was wrong?
[04:59:06] <taplar> learning opportunity
[05:00:25] <tuskkk___> yes, just had to set a flag
[05:00:35] <tuskkk___> that flag was causing a reload on the other page
[05:01:00] <tuskkk___> complex stuff is javascript
[05:01:07] <taplar> nah
[05:01:13] <taplar> complex stuff is what people try to do with it
[05:18:11] <infoget> Hi guys, I have div element with 4 hidden inputs with classes (.a, .b, .c, .d classes) inside. The div element is stored in the 'this' variable. How can I get value of hidden input with ".a" class easiest way?
[05:18:44] <taplar> is the class literally '.a'?
[05:19:14] <taplar> or is it class="a"
[05:19:37] <infoget> yeah, it's class="a" inside of div element
[05:19:54] <taplar> $(this).find('.a').val()
[05:24:09] <infoget> taplar: thank u very much, .find method what I was looking for :)
[05:26:34] <clocKwize> Hey guys, can you check my fiddle out? http://jsfiddle.net/j5kmwvny/12/ - I'm trying to highlight squares based on mouse drag. There seems to be a mismatch with the mouse position I'm getting relative to the main UL and the LI (square) position relative to the main UL... It works without all the extra stuff above
[05:30:56] <clocKwize> I've got it working using screen relative positions ( like so http://jsfiddle.net/j5kmwvny/13/ ) but I'd rather do it relative to the element if possible
[05:34:02] <onion> I'm using $.Callbacks('stopOnFalse'), but I'm wondering if there's a way to tell when an attached function does return false
[05:34:45] <tuskkk___> One thing I am confused about. Some ajax call is written on a page called 'create', it calls a method which renders another page called "social", there is also some javascript on that page. Now when we set a flag to false on "social" then on the ajax success callback on 'create', do I have that flag set?
[05:36:15] <Cork> tuskkk___: as long as the document (the original page) isn't unloaded, js variables says around
[06:36:16] <Pazician> Hello, why does this not work? I want it to just view one post not all of them when clicked on "expand" - also, I want the icon to change when it's on wider screens or smaller ones, the class should be added and removed on resize https://jsfiddle.net/ftj4tyhw/
[06:37:43] <zumba_ad_> hi folks. I'm getting a jquery344354353_53454353 is not a function from my jsonp request when the api returns after the timeout I set. I was told to wrap the function with try-catch so I can capture the error "Uncaught TypeError"
[06:37:59] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I need your help.
[06:38:09] <JosefDe> Previously I asked about calling a function dynamically
[06:38:24] <Pazician> Did I miss something?
[06:38:29] <zumba_ad_> however, the function is dynamically created by JQuery. So how will I wrap that callback?
[06:39:33] <zumba_ad_> i actually posted it in stackoverflow and the person was responding to it - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32515179/javascripts-try-catch-is-failing-on-typeerror?noredirect=1#comment52907191_32515179
[06:39:56] <Pazician> Hello, why does this not work? I want it to just view one post not all of them when clicked on "expand" - also, I want the icon to change when it's on wider screens or smaller ones, the class should be added and removed on resize https://jsfiddle.net/ftj4tyhw/
[06:40:53] <Cork> zumba_ad_: how are you making the call?
[06:41:10] <zumba_ad_> $.ajax with dataType = jsonp
[06:41:34] <zumba_ad_> it works often but starts to fail when our api returns the response beyond the timeout I specified
[06:41:34] <Cork> Pazician: it is the same time as last time we talked about similar problem
[06:41:52] <Cork> Pazician: your toggling all of them as projInfo is $('.project-info')
[06:42:10] <Cork> Pazician: instead you need to find the project-info related to the toggle
[06:42:27] <zumba_ad_> Cork: but the callback will still be received even if I've set a timeout. Javascript will complain with "I cannot find the jquery function"
[06:42:40] <Cork> zumba_ad_: hmm it might be that jquery cleans up the function when it timesout
[06:43:02] <zumba_ad_> it cleans out the function once it reaches the timeout period
[06:43:03] <Cork> zumba_ad_: it isn't jquery that complains
[06:43:14] <zumba_ad_> it's not jquery that complains, it's Javascript
[06:43:27] <Cork> well ya, or rather the jsonp js content
[06:43:35] <zumba_ad_> yup
[06:43:49] <Cork> zumba_ad_: have you through about using cors instead of the jsonp hack?
[06:43:59] <Cork> or do you need old ie support?
[06:44:01] <zumba_ad_> it's not our server
[06:44:05] <Cork> ah
[06:44:18] <Pazician> Cork: I tried like this but it doesn't workout: https://jsfiddle.net/ftj4tyhw/
[06:44:34] <Cork> zumba_ad_: well you could just raise the timeout i guess
[06:44:41] <Pazician> Cork: Sorry, https://jsfiddle.net/ftj4tyhw/2/
[06:45:04] <zumba_ad_> that's what I did and it's working great but if that appears again, the Uncaught TypeError will be displayed again
[06:45:11] <Cork> Pazician: the problem isn't the event
[06:45:41] <Cork> Pazician: it is that you do "when this special .fa is clicked slideToggle ALL project-info elements
[06:46:02] <Cork> you need to filter out the project element related to the event
[06:46:25] <Cork> zumba_ad_: ya, not much you can do about it
[06:46:34] <Cork> zumba_ad_: jsonp is a hack, and always will be
[06:46:42] <zumba_ad_> i'm still interested on what the person told me in stackoverflow
[06:46:44] <Cork> (and a security problem)
[06:46:47] <zumba_ad_> k
[06:46:59] <zumba_ad_> i am not sure if the person knows what he was telling me
[06:47:25] <Cork> well no that wouldn't work
[06:47:26] <zumba_ad_> he was telling me to wrap the function with the try catch but i told him the function/callback is dynamiclly created
[06:47:30] <zumba_ad_> k
[06:47:31] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, so something like this? But now it's working on the wider screen not on the smaller one https://jsfiddle.net/ftj4tyhw/3/
[06:47:44] <Cork> cause the exception comes from the jsonp resource failing to call the function it has in its .js resource
[06:47:48] <Cork> zumba_ad_: ^
[06:48:12] <Cork> zumba_ad_: so the only way to catch that error is 1. bind an window.onerror, or 2. wrap the function inside the jsonp resoponse
[06:48:31] <Cork> Pazician: yes
[06:48:42] <zumba_ad_> so it comes from the jsonp data I received? and inside that jsonp data, it's calling the function? Is that how jsonp works? I'm not much familiar with jsonp
[06:49:12] <Cork> zumba_ad_: yes, jsonp works by the site defining a function and the resource calling the function with the json data
[06:49:21] <zumba_ad_> Cork: i wrapped our $.ajax with try-catch. Is that what you mean?
[06:49:27] <Cork> no
[06:49:31] <zumba_ad_> oh
[06:49:38] <zumba_ad_> how is it done
[06:49:46] <Cork> ok let me fiddle something
[06:50:18] <snowdogs> Hi guys, I'm hoping someone can help me with this: http://pastebin.com/DQRYPBcY  - I'm trying to check if any submenus are open, and then close them if the user is closing the main menu.
[06:50:21] <zumba_ad_> damn, I'm going to get cut in 3-5 mins since i'll be arriving in the tunnel. I'll still be online
[06:50:45] <zumba_ad_> If I miss it Cork, I'll be online again in few minutes
[06:50:56] <zumba_ad_> thank you so much!!! :)
[06:52:56] <Cork> zumba_ad_: http://jsfiddle.net/uypx4xq9/
[06:53:05] <Cork> this is a half psudo code
[06:53:10] <Cork> but this is basically how it works
[06:58:30] <Pazician> Cork: I'm still struggling with this, I can't get it to work and it seems like the .project-info can't be found? https://jsfiddle.net/ftj4tyhw/4/
[07:00:43] <zumba_ad_> I'm back. Hi Cork
[07:01:40] <mvpgraff> Is there a way to target multiple element classes using toggleClass? Example: $(selector).toggleClass('oldClass1 oldClass2 newClass1 newClass2');
[07:03:40] <zumba_ad_> did I miss the fiddle?
[07:04:00] <oddvar> > <Pazician> Cork: I'm still struggling with this, I can't get it to work and it seems like the .project-info can't be found? https://jsfiddle.net/ftj4tyhw/4/
[07:04:31] <Cork> Pazician: .fa isn't a parent
[07:04:47] <Cork> Pazician: you need to find the common parent of the project and the expand
[07:04:57] <Cork> zumba_ad_: yes
[07:05:03] <zumba_ad_> thank you so much :)
[07:05:15] <Pazician> Cork: I should I do that?
[07:05:34] <zumba_ad_> can't wait to try it out on our code :D
[07:05:41] <Cork> Pazician: i helped you with that exact problem
[07:05:55] <Cork> zumba_ad_: what i gave you wan't meant to be used
[07:06:01] <Cork> it was meant to explain how it works
[07:06:26] <zumba_ad_> Cork: I didn't see the fiddle because I lost the connection when I left the train. Can you please paste it again
[07:06:33] <Cork> zumba_ad_: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20150911.log.html
[07:06:35] <zumba_ad_> cool
[07:06:40] <Pazician> Cork: It's working! Thank you so much! https://jsfiddle.net/ftj4tyhw/6/
[07:07:39] <Cork> Pazician: np
[07:14:21] <zumba_ad_> am I right Cork that I will have to now add a function which will be assigned to jsonpCallback and then put your logic into it?
[07:14:41] <Cork> zumba_ad_: no
[07:14:54] <zumba_ad_> :( i'm sorry, i still not getting it
[07:14:57] <Cork> zumba_ad_: what that fiddle shows you is what happens when you make a jsonp call
[07:15:07] <zumba_ad_> gotcha
[07:15:32] <Cork> so what ever you do in the code for the "site" part wont catch the errors in the jsonp part
[07:15:39] <Cork> as they aren't related in execution
[07:15:43] <zumba_ad_> k
[07:15:50] <zumba_ad_> you mentioned 2 options earlier
[07:15:57] <Cork> zumba_ad_: the one option you have is to catch ALL errors in the page
[07:16:06] <zumba_ad_> 1. bind an window.onerror, or 2. wrap the function inside the jsonp resoponse
[07:16:17] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onerror
[07:16:21] <zumba_ad_> cool
[07:16:31] <Cork> ^ this one is bound as $(window).on('error', func)
[07:16:43] <Cork> with jquery (and it is how you should do it)
[07:16:45] <Pazician> Cork: Why does this not work? https://jsfiddle.net/ftj4tyhw/7/ I want it to get inside the paragraph or underneath it, like when you click on the expand it should get underneath the paragraph and not under the whole section
[07:17:01] <zumba_ad_> k
[07:17:09] <Cork> but note you will silence all code errors in the page if you cancel them in that handler
[07:17:20] <zumba_ad_> ah, glad you mentioned it
[07:17:37] <Cork> Pazician: cause this is the window object on that line
[07:18:51] <Pazician> Cork: What you mean?
[07:19:18] <Cork> Pazician: i think you need to look into the basics of js, events and jquery
[07:19:45] <Cork> Pazician: this is a special variable, and events sets them to the element they fired on
[07:19:58] <Cork> Pazician: that is why you can use $(this).closest in the click handler
[07:20:05] <Cork> on the resize it won't work though
[07:20:42] <Cork> Pazician: also note you will have hundreds of event handlers in a few seconds with that code
[07:21:21] <Cork> cause every time resize fires and the window width is smaller then 800px you will bind a new handler
[07:22:21] <Pazician> Cork: I understand, could I move the on('click', ... outside the function and just do a if statement if the window.width is smaller than 800px?
[07:22:40] <Cork> no cause that will only execute on page load
[07:23:01] <Pazician> Cork: Hmm... Right! How could I do it then? - I'm kinda confused
[07:23:04] <Cork> the best option is to just make the if check inside the click handler when it "would fire"
[07:23:22] <Cork> that results in the check only having to fire when someone actually clicks
[07:24:41] <Pazician> Cork: Do you've time and the energy for making an demo maybe? And if possible if it's not much to ask, if you could maybe also include how to get the appendTo() workout?
[07:25:19] <mvpgraff> Hey Cork, think you can help with my question earlier, it's simple
[07:25:25] <Cork> Pazician: have you checked https://learn.jquery.com/ ?
[07:25:37] <Cork> mvpgraff: ask it again
[07:26:02] <mvpgraff> Is there a way to target multiple element classes using toggleClass? Example: $(selector).toggleClass('oldClass1 oldClass2 newClass1 newClass2');
[07:26:25] <Pazician> Cork: I've been sneaking on it, sorry if I ask some dumb questions...
[07:26:43] <Cork> Pazician: it isn't dumb questions
[07:27:16] <mvpgraff> dumb questions don't exist, only dumb answers that teach nothing
[07:27:19] <Cork> just basic ones that are kinda expected that ppl learn through the tutorials
[07:27:26] <Uhkis> we were all noobs once!
[07:27:38] <Cork> ya
[07:27:46] <taplar> i thought toggleClass did just that, toggled -a- class, not swap classes
[07:27:51] <Cork> mvpgraff: i almost said yes, but then i remembered that it actually bugs out if you do that
[07:28:21] <Cork> ah, wow did i even misunderstood the question?
[07:28:34] <Cork> i thought you meant to flip all the classes
[07:28:47] <Cork> cause yes you toggle class only handles a single class
[07:29:32] <mvpgraff> yea, as expected - I was curious if there something out there that combats that though. I'm trying to switch bootstrap classes using jQuery for A/B testing on a page
[07:30:07] <Cork> mvpgraff: what toggleClass does is taking the className attribute from the element
[07:30:11] <Cork> then split them on space
[07:30:17] <taplar> $(selector).removeClass('oldClass').addClass('newClass')
[07:30:23] <Cork> and then check if the "value" exists inside that array
[07:30:50] <Cork> so if you give toggleClass a string with multiple classes things go bonkers
[07:31:29] <taplar> actually to prevent maybe some unwanted proliferation
[07:31:37] <taplar> $(selector).filter('oldClass').removeClass('oldClass').addClass('newClass')
[07:31:38] <Cork> mvpgraff: $('.oldClass1').removeClass('oldClass1').addClass('newClass1')
[07:31:43] <Pazician> Cork: What do you think about this, this works pretty much like I want now: https://jsfiddle.net/ftj4tyhw/8/
[07:32:13] <mvpgraff> taplar, so then in reality it would be like this: $(selector).removeClass('oldClass1').removeClass('oldClass2').addClass('newClass1').addClass('newClass2');
[07:32:31] <taplar> that would add the new classes to all the selectors
[07:32:45] <taplar> if that is not what is intended, you'll need to filter like i did above
[07:32:50] <mvpgraff> fc
[07:32:59] <Uhkis> holy mother of classes
[07:33:01] <mvpgraff> that takes so much more time though and what I was trying to avoid xD
[07:33:52] <mvpgraff> column classes are no fun when trying to A/B test :\
[07:38:18] <taplar> jquery ui 1.7, http://api.jqueryui.com/switchClass/
[07:39:25] <taplar> or i guess 1.7 was a change to the queue thing, anyway, ^
[07:44:14] <mvpgraff> hmmm, thanks taplar, it's leading towards taking my time and just building it out one by one... :[
[07:47:09] <VectorX> is jQuery("body").click(function(e){ the way to do something like jQuery("document").click(function(e){   where i need to capture an event inside the window area
[07:49:21] <tash> I'm doing some hid() stuff on a page, but when you first load the page you can see the stuff I want to hide.  When the page loads, then it hides. Looks bad to the user. Any way to hide before the entire page loads?
[07:49:26] <tash> hide() *
[07:49:28] <taplar> VectorX: either should work
[07:49:52] <taplar> VectorX: but as a general rule, bind as low as possible
[07:50:14] <VectorX> document doesnt seem to be working
[07:50:19] <VectorX> if i change to body it does
[07:50:37] <taplar> oh
[07:50:42] <taplar> don't do ""
[07:50:45] <taplar> for document
[07:50:49] <taplar> it's a variable
[07:50:58] <VectorX> good to go
[07:50:59] <VectorX> ty
[07:51:35] <VectorX> so do body over document which is what you are saying, ie binding low
[07:52:07] <taplar> as low as possible, so if your concerned with a click event on an image, bind on the image, or delegate bind on the images parent
[07:52:23] <taplar> but if you truely are concerned with the entire body, it meets your needs to bind on the body
[07:52:50] <VectorX> i got a expanding search button, so trying to catch anything other than the search so i can close it, if either the input or the icon wasnt clicked
[07:53:30] <VectorX> generally im only concerned with a few parts of the body, but in this case everything but those parts
[07:54:16] <taplar> tash: you'll need to make it hidden in the html then, or dynamically add it to the body after the fact
[07:55:22] <tash> ok, I might try the former first
[07:56:39] <VectorX> tash why not use a class and hide with that first then it will be faster
[08:00:56] <tash> VectorX: I don't know why :) Still learning as I go.  I should probably show the code for a little more context: http://pastebin.com/zFWhVXbK ... That's in $(document).ready(function(){}  I'm doing a .get() and based on that result I'm hiding stuff.  I just want it to be less visible to the user that I'm actually doing that.
[08:01:48] <taplar> uh, what are you doing with the data?
[08:02:01] <taplar> other than logging it
[08:02:02] <VectorX> tash so add a deafult css class like .user_bar {display : none} and you will be good to go
[08:02:06] <VectorX> just in your css
[08:02:13] <tash> taplar: $('.notes_box_content').html(data);
[08:02:15] <VectorX> then when you need .show() using js
[08:02:19] <tash> sorry I didn't noticed that got removed from my paste
[08:02:37] <taplar> are those classes meaning to reference elements in the data?
[08:03:04] <tash> yeah, those classes are just so I can select them, should I be using id's instead?
[08:03:26] <taplar> no, what i mean is, your trying to hide elements that are being added to the page, via that data
[08:03:50] <taplar> ^ meant as a question
[08:04:09] <tash> ah, no ... the things that are being hidden are static, they aren't being created with the data
[08:04:29] <tash> I just added the classes to them so I could use as selectors.
[08:04:47] <tash> VectorX: thanks. I'll give that a shot
[08:04:51] <taplar> yeah so try what VectorX said
[08:05:03] <tash> roger, going to give it a try now
[08:05:05] <dimi1947> is it possible conditional validation?...for example If I have 2 input boxes..that are initially required...if one for them gets filled than the other ceases to be required
[08:05:44] <VectorX> dimi1947 yes it is possible
[08:05:58] <dimi1947> oh....how?
[08:06:02] <VectorX> that would be a bery basic check
[08:06:05] <VectorX> very
[08:06:23] <dimi1947> is there a jquery validate method for that?
[08:06:34] <taplar> what's the context.  are you using a validation library?
[08:06:45] <dimi1947> jquery.validate
[08:06:48] <taplar> k
[08:08:23] <taplar> not up on that library but: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8137844/jquery-validation-two-fields-only-required-to-fill-in-one#8138053

[08:45:14] <VictorCL> snowdogs   if(#subMenu.hasClass('open')   ???
[08:47:12] <VictorCL> snowdogs try this http://pastebin.com/XNLF6FkX
[08:47:44] <snowdogs> VictorCL: thanks, taking a look now :)
[08:49:10] <snowdogs> VictorCL: thanks for that, unfortunately, if i do that it will slideToggle all elements with class .subMenu
[08:49:46] <VictorCL> is what u had originally
[08:49:48] <VictorCL> I just fixed it
[08:50:17] <taplar> uh, your using #, that's an id, not a class
[08:50:30] <taplar> or that's what you gave in the code snipplet
[08:51:03] <snowdogs> taplar: you're right, i'm an idiot - wasn't thinking when writing the pastebin
[08:51:10] <snowdogs> taplar: it's supposed to be a class
[08:51:17] <snowdogs> taplar: sorry, that makes all the difference
[08:51:42] <taplar> can you update your snipplet?
[08:51:46] <snowdogs> taplar: yeah def
[08:52:21] <snowdogs> taplar: http://pastebin.com/DQRYPBcY
[08:52:29] <snowdogs> damnit - i need to fix the comment too
[08:52:41] <snowdogs> ok it's fixed :)
[08:52:57] <taplar> $('.subMenu').filter('.open').slideToggle();
[08:53:04] <taplar> no need for an if
[08:53:36] <snowdogs> taplar: thanks i'll try it out right now
[08:55:46] <snowdogs> taplar: wow that works great, thank you!

[09:08:15] <adv_> robertmaxrees: hi, remember this ? http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/756em9ot/6/
[09:09:27] <adv_> robertmaxrees: on the 1st mouseenter happening, there is a blank space while it's loading all the lazy images, how can i make it so that it displays a loading placeholder.gif while it loads the lazy images?
[09:09:32] <adv_> for better ux
[09:11:57] <jak2000> hi all, when i debugg a webpage in Chrome, how to know if a div is created or is invisible or exists?
[09:12:24] <taplar> jak2000: $(selector).length > 0 will let you know if it exists
[09:14:34] <robertmaxrees> adv_ lol there's over 650 people in the channel ;)
[09:14:53] <robertmaxrees> and that's... not as simple as it sounds.
[09:15:10] <adv_> robertmaxrees: but you already know what's going on with that thing :)
[09:15:14] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[09:15:27] <jak2000> taplar thanks
[09:15:31] <robertmaxrees> i barely remember what i ate for breakfast, and i ate less than an hour ago and it's the same thing every day ;)
[09:15:37] <adv_> lol
[09:15:56] <adv_> robertmaxrees: did you understand what i asked?
[09:16:06] <robertmaxrees> why am i the only one who can help?
[09:16:31] <robertmaxrees> and the issue is a little more complex than I think you realize.
[09:16:58] <jak2000> other advice, i want create a wizard with this questions 1) Wich Customer? CANCEL/NEXT 2) Wich City CANCEL/NEXT 3) Range of Price CANCEL/NEXT ..... any advice how to start it?
[09:17:02] <robertmaxrees> you need to create the image elements on the fly, attach a load event handler to them before insterting the source, and then swap them out as necessary.
[09:17:06] <robertmaxrees> adv_ ^
[09:21:42] <adv_> robertmaxrees: you're not the only one i guess but you were the original helper heh
[09:22:01] <robertmaxrees> did you read any of what i just said though?
[09:22:12] <adv_> robertmaxrees: hm.. sounds complicated, would that eliminate all of the current overhead?
[09:22:16] <adv_> yes^
[09:23:20] <arc_> it's not that complicated
[09:23:29] <robertmaxrees> that would add more overhead.
[09:23:40] <adv_> then it defeats the purpose..
[09:23:50] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:23:56] <robertmaxrees> coupla things.
[09:24:00] <robertmaxrees> 1: stop prematurely optimizing.
[09:24:09] <robertmaxrees> 2: "overhead" is a really broad term
[09:24:54] <adv_> what i'm really asking is: is there a way that i can eliminate that blank thing that happens on the 1st mouseenter (because the lazy images haven't loaded yet)?
[09:25:01] <adv_> it looks like a flicker
[09:25:05] <robertmaxrees> yes - i just explained how :)
[09:25:19] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, load the first, say, 5 images normally.
[09:25:27] <adv_> but if i do what you said there will still be overhead but another kind
[09:25:35] <robertmaxrees> there will be additional overhead.
[09:25:38] <robertmaxrees> it's about tradeoffs.
[09:26:01] <robertmaxrees> have the first 5 load normally and then do the rest like you are now.
[09:26:31] <adv_> ah ok, how about i load the original thumbnail on mouseenter while loading the lazy ones? can i do that? so that there is no flicker
[09:26:48] <adv_> the original one is already loaded
[09:26:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:27:07] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you've overcomplicating this.
[09:27:22] <adv_>         <img src="http://lorempixel.com/200/200/people/1" class="ts-currslide"  />
[09:27:22] <adv_>  , this one
[09:27:34] <robertmaxrees> i'd do the first 5 or so.
[09:27:36] <robertmaxrees> not just the first one.
[09:28:05] <adv_> first 5 is too much for 100 items
[09:28:11] <robertmaxrees> wut
[09:28:35] <robertmaxrees> no it's not.  5 small images should not have that kind of impact.
[09:28:38] <adv_> it's 100 items like the one in the fiddle, each one with 9 frames
[09:29:01] <adv_> it's 100*5
[09:29:12] <robertmaxrees> so there are 100 of these thumbnail prieview thingers?
[09:29:16] <adv_> yes
[09:29:26] <adv_> you helped me do it the other day
[09:29:27] <adv_> lol
[09:29:51] <robertmaxrees> i vaguely remember something about 100 images.  not 100 of these carousels.
[09:30:03] <adv_> it works fine, i just have a flicker (which looks like bad ux) upon mouse entering each one
[09:30:12] <adv_> afterwards it's fine
[09:30:17] <robertmaxrees> i read that a half dozen times already ;)
[09:30:22] <arc_> 500 images is a lot to load on one page
[09:30:34] <hapi> .
[09:31:09] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to make a spirte for each one that loads on mouseenter of the parent container or something
[09:31:15] <arc_> actually i guess it's 900 images -_-
[09:31:18] <taplar> so.... what exactly is the point of this lazy load?  cause as you have it, once you mouse over the first time, your going to load all 500...
[09:31:57] <adv_> robertmaxrees: this was the last fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/2xLc672m/
[09:32:19] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[09:32:28] <robertmaxrees> are you already having performance problems?
[09:32:30] <adv_> no i just load the 9 frames of each item upon mouseenter on this item
[09:32:49] <robertmaxrees> like, have you actually tried any of this?  can you corroborate your claims of poor performacne?
[09:32:49] <taplar> so there are -not- 900 images...
[09:32:52] <robertmaxrees> *performance
[09:32:59] <adv_> no, everything is fine except from that blank
[09:33:01] <robertmaxrees> taplar there are 10 or so per "thumbnail"
[09:33:07] <taplar> ah
[09:33:10] <robertmaxrees> there are 10 "Thumbnails"
[09:33:12] <adv_> it's not poor performance, it's a ux issue
[09:33:22] <arc_> he said there are 100 thumbnails
[09:33:25] <robertmaxrees> adv_ so then load the first 5 for all of them on pageload.
[09:33:33] <jak2000> taplar?
[09:33:35] <robertmaxrees> see how that feels.
[09:33:36] <adv_> but first 5 of them is 500 images
[09:33:37] <taplar> so the selector for the .lazy to load the thumbs is to broad
[09:33:41] <adv_> right now it's 100
[09:33:50] <robertmaxrees> adv_ have you actually tried it yet?
[09:33:56] <robertmaxrees> and did you run all of these images through a compressor?
[09:33:56] <adv_> robertmaxrees: yes
[09:33:59] <adv_> yes
[09:34:03] <taplar> jak2000: sup
[09:34:09] <robertmaxrees> then follow my advice from earlier.
[09:34:13] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you're basically stuck.
[09:34:27] <adv_> i get the blank flicker for some ms but it looks bad for ux
[09:34:40] <robertmaxrees> sure does, so load the first 5 normally.
[09:34:42] <robertmaxrees> flicker gone.
[09:35:03] <adv_> but why not the one that i have already loaded? the 1st one
[09:35:14] <robertmaxrees> the initial one is already loaded.
[09:35:17] <adv_> so that i stay with 100 initial loads instead of 500
[09:35:24] <adv_> yes exactly
[09:35:26] <robertmaxrees> then you'll have the flicker.
[09:35:32] <arc_> i don't get why you think that will change anything
[09:35:36] <arc_> that's what is already happening
[09:35:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:35:47] <arc_> loading the first one
[09:35:49] <robertmaxrees> i mean use normal image tags instead of the lazy loader.
[09:35:56] <robertmaxrees> the first 5 for all the thumbnail thingers.
[09:35:57] <adv_> can't i make it behave like: don't display the other 8 frames until all have loaded ?
[09:36:08] <robertmaxrees> that's terrible ux.
[09:36:21] <robertmaxrees> now it's inconsistently working based on something that shouldn't matter to the end user.
[09:36:45] <adv_> you mean my last sentence?
[09:37:15] <robertmaxrees> your last idea, yes.
[09:38:04] <robertmaxrees> you either get flicker, or you're loading a bunch of images on pageload.  load event handlers aren't necessarily reliable on images in the case unless you go through a bunch of rigamorale to get them to work.
[09:39:15] <adv_> ok then i'll leave it as it is
[09:39:28] <adv_> more lightweight  > flicker
[09:39:50] <robertmaxrees> lol you're really obsessed with this lightweight concept.
[09:39:51] <robertmaxrees> why?
[09:40:38] <skizm> what is the purpose of the page? what about doing something like fading in each thumbnail as its assets have finished loading? so people aren't mousing over stuff that hasn't finished loading?
[09:41:03] <robertmaxrees> skizm knowing when things have "finished loading" is the headache there/
[09:41:50] <robertmaxrees> the load event doesn't bubble, so now you're binding 900+ load event listeners (one to each image) and adding in a bunch of deferred logic to handle that, and adv_ is (for some strange reason) really obsessed with performance.
[09:42:11] <skizm> unfortunate
[09:42:22] <adv_> robertmaxrees: because i don't want a laggy webpage ? :/
[09:42:31] <jak2000> escuse me:
[09:42:35] <jak2000> other advice, i want create a wizard with this questions 1) Wich Customer? CANCEL/NEXT 2) Wich City CANCEL/NEXT 3) Range of Price CANCEL/NEXT ..... any advice how to start it?
[09:42:39] <robertmaxrees> you're prematurely optimizing though, adv_
[09:43:13] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what kind of advice are you looking for?
[09:43:27] <robertmaxrees> you want a form with some divs that you hide/show using some event listeners.
[09:44:15] <adv_> it works as it is, i just thought i could easily get rid of the ux annoyance which is the initial mouseenter flicker (not the flicker between the lazy images, to be specific)
[09:44:32] <robertmaxrees> adv_ your UX annoyance is based off of something that seems like an assumption.
[09:44:46] <adv_> which assumption
[09:44:51] <Uhkis> isn't all UX based on assumptions? ;)
[09:45:08] <Uhkis> well, ux design that is
[09:45:11] <taplar> should be based on research
[09:45:15] <robertmaxrees> that loading the first few images for each of those "Carousels" is somehow going to present a big problem.
[09:45:39] <Uhkis> taplar: yes, that research creates those assumptions
[09:45:45] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis eeeh...
[09:45:48] <taplar> huh?
[09:45:49] <robertmaxrees> not really assumptions.
[09:45:57] <robertmaxrees> you can quantify things pretty quickly.
[09:46:00] <taplar> lol, by that reasoning, everything is an assumption.... i assume
[09:46:32] <Uhkis> well, everything starting with "most users.."
[09:46:43] <taplar> can't please everyone
[09:46:48] <robertmaxrees> which usually means "most of our users..."
[09:46:52] <robertmaxrees> aka "our average user"
[09:47:15] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis a/b testing is pretty cool ;)
[09:47:20] <adv_> but i can see 500 requests vs 100 requests in the network tab
[09:47:30] <robertmaxrees> sure.  and how is it performing for you?
[09:47:41] <Uhkis> but this is psychology, not for #jquery
[09:47:54] <taplar> you mean philosophy?
[09:47:57] <robertmaxrees> adv_ close your dev tools for a second.
[09:48:13] <adv_> i see what you mena
[09:48:16] <adv_> mean*
[09:48:31] <robertmaxrees> you're assuming you have performance issues without actually seeing if they exist.
[09:48:49] <robertmaxrees> what's your overall pageweight?
[09:57:19] <jak2000> taplar, robertmaxrees, yes or modal forms?
[09:57:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:57:37] <robertmaxrees> really depends on what your use case is.
[10:01:03] <taplar> one question i kinda have is, you listed three questions.  how complicated are the answers?  cause if they're not and don't take up much room, personally, i'd just present all three at once.
[10:02:06] <jak2000> ok, i learn more about your comment and return here thanks robertmaxrees
[10:16:54] <Uhkis> taplar: im pretty sure human behaviour falls under psychology
[10:17:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:17:47] <taplar> but you were talking about the difference between an assumption and fact
[10:18:01] <taplar> or quantatative results
[10:18:06] <taplar> which is more philosophical
[10:19:20] <Uhkis> that is also true
[10:24:14] <zigzagzig> what's everyone's favorite jQuery plugins?
[10:24:48] <mvpgraff> d3
[10:25:04] <jak2000> interesting: http://www.jquery-steps.com/Examples#embed
[10:26:27] <zigzagzig> mvpgraff: that looks interesting never heard of it
[10:26:42] <robertmaxrees> isn't d3 a library?
[10:27:11] <Uhkis> my vote goes to chosen
[10:27:12] <taplar> my favorite plugin is Air Wick
[10:28:24] <taplar> or maybe Glade.  i think they were the first with the whole "plug it in, plug it in" song
[10:28:51] <Uhkis> lol jak2000, that looks exactly the thing i tried to find when i originally joined this channel
[10:30:25] <jak2000> Uhkis really? and found other plugin?
[10:32:14] <Uhkis> no, i didnt even ask for it in the end and stayed to help people :D
[10:32:46] <taplar> like i always say
[10:32:50] <jak2000> i looking other plugins, but there is the ebst.
[10:32:51] <taplar> come for help, stay for the insults
[10:32:52] <jak2000> *best
[10:32:53] <taplar> ...help
[10:33:25] <zigzagzig> lol
[10:33:30] <zigzagzig> i guess i'll stick around here then
[10:33:33] <taplar> nah, this place is pretty good
[10:34:00] <Uhkis> back then robertmaxrees used some weird nickname, dutch something iirc :D
[10:34:05] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[10:34:09] <dimi1947> I am looking into this...http://jqueryvalidation.org/required-method
[10:34:09] <robertmaxrees> duch_kazatel
[10:34:38] <robertmaxrees> the olden days.
[10:34:55] <dimi1947> there is a case of conditional required...where if on field is empty then ....the required attribute will have effect
[10:35:18] <dimi1947> just go to this example...Makes details required only if #other is checked.
[10:35:23] <Uhkis> and BillCriswell (or something) was active
[10:35:35] <robertmaxrees> yep.  he's still around sometimes.
[10:35:48] <robertmaxrees> smart dude.
[10:35:50] <taplar> did you ask this earlier dimi?  someone asked about requiring one of two fields
[10:35:55] <mvpgraff> I've talked to bill not to long ago
[10:36:06] <dimi1947> my question is if this conditional can apply for 2 inputs....that a field is required is 2 inputs are empty
[10:36:10] <dimi1947> can this be done?
[10:36:30] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you can setup that kind of logic, just kind of complex.
[10:36:40] <Uhkis> most of what i talked about with bill was 100% off-topic in the morning
[10:36:53] <taplar> i need to find that link again...
[10:36:54] <Uhkis> your nighttime i guess
[10:37:01] <robertmaxrees> nah may daytime.
[10:37:09] <robertmaxrees> he's three hours after me.
[10:37:18] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees,....with my own custome code or jquery's validate?
[10:37:19] <Uhkis> yeah, but my morning is in 12h ;)
[10:37:30] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8137844/jquery-validation-two-fields-only-required-to-fill-in-one#8138053
[10:37:32] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 your own code in jqueryvalidate
[10:46:04] <dimi1947> It does not work...I am trying to find out why
[10:46:16] <taplar> got a fiddle?
[10:46:38] <dimi1947> I will prepare one
[10:52:12] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of a good solution they can recommend to drag and drop multiple files and upload when form is submitted?
[10:53:20] <Forbidd3n> dropzone, even though not jquery adds it to the entire form not just a div area for dropping
[10:55:03] <dimi1947> here is the fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/fvc3dohg/
[10:55:21] <taplar> Forbidd3n: i've seen this guy used before https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[10:56:04] <dimi1947> I have written the code such when the name is empty company name is required....but it does not work
[10:56:10] <Forbidd3n> taplar: doesn't upload with form
[10:56:43] <taplar> dimi1947: your required look much different that the example in that link
[10:57:10] <taplar> your giving it a string rather than a callback to perform
[10:58:30] <taplar> Forbidd3n: ah, sorry about that
[10:59:26] <dimi1947> if this is what you think I put....it still does not work
[10:59:55] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/fvc3dohg/2/
[11:00:31] <taplar> your still just giving it a string...
[11:09:30] <taplar> here, did the first one https://jsfiddle.net/fvc3dohg/7/
[11:13:25] <dimi1947> give me a second...
[11:15:07] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/fvc3dohg/
[11:36:05] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I'm binding a click-event. But then load some new stuff via ajax and have to rebind again. This time, the already bounded elements don't react to click event. How can I fix this?
[11:36:19] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[11:36:36] <robertmaxrees> check out http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[11:38:42] <jak2000> Uhkis tested the plugin? Wizard plugin?
[11:38:57] <JosefDe> ?
[11:38:58] <Uhkis> jak2000: no
[11:39:37] <jak2000> can you try? please (Strange i followed the steps and not see the effect
[11:39:45] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 make a fiddle instead.
[11:39:52] <robertmaxrees> show us what you tried.
[11:40:02] <jak2000> ok
[11:41:06] <Zzaichik> is this the proper way to create an anonymous function in a variable?
[11:41:06] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/1b1gqvvf/
[11:41:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:41:47] <Zzaichik> to make an anonymous function, that is called automatically.
[11:41:51] <Zzaichik> That's what I'm trying to do
[11:41:57] <robertmaxrees> why?
[11:42:01] <taplar> an IIFE?
[11:42:12] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to run the function on window scroll?
[11:42:16] <Zzaichik> so I don't have to call the function
[11:42:19] <Zzaichik> yes
[11:42:23] <Zzaichik> and before window scroll
[11:42:35] <Zzaichik> call it before window scroll to initialize
[11:42:35] <robertmaxrees> that's very different than what you're doing here.
[11:42:42] <robertmaxrees> anFunc is getting assigned to the return of that IIFE.
[11:42:51] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to call that function twice.
[11:42:53] <Zzaichik> I know I'm doing it totally wrong. I need help
[11:43:05] <Zzaichik> Okay, so I need to do it the standard way
[11:43:15] <Zzaichik> call the function both inside and outside of window.scroll
[11:43:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1b1gqvvf/1/
[11:43:17] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[11:43:30] <robertmaxrees> err, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1b1gqvvf/2/
[11:43:43] <JosefDe> elü? Anyüne who wonts hülp mi?
[11:43:51] <robertmaxrees> i answered you earlier.
[11:43:51] <taplar> got a ) in your function def
[11:44:00] <robertmaxrees> hah, that's bad, too.
[11:44:00] <robertmaxrees> derp.
[11:44:02] <robertmaxrees> you get the idea.
[11:44:14] <Zzaichik> okay thanks robertmaxrees. I was thinking there would be a way to call it automatically outside of window.scroll
[11:44:14] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe use event delegation - check out the two URLs I sent.
[11:44:18] <robertmaxrees> Zzaichik nope.
[11:44:23] <Zzaichik> Yeah robertmaxrees I know what you mean. Thanks man.
[11:45:49] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[11:46:06] <jak2000> i am follow the basic sample: http://www.jquery-steps.com/Examples here my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/he42tuy9/   but not work any advice?
[11:46:18] <robertmaxrees> open your console
[11:46:28] <robertmaxrees> great first place to start.
[11:46:37] <Sal> hi
[11:46:41] <taplar> moro
[11:46:50] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you can't use https://github.com/rstaib/jquery-steps/blob/master/build/jquery.steps.js for the external lib link
[11:46:58] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: bot hüw shüll I üse it?
[11:47:04] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you need to use something like https://rawgit.com/
[11:47:08] <Sal> how can i query '.grid .col:after' to change broder color?
[11:47:11] <Sal> border
[11:47:20] <robertmaxrees> Sal you can't target :after with jquery
[11:47:24] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe those links explain it.
[11:47:36] <robertmaxrees> read them and try - if you're still lost, show us some code.
[11:47:49] <Sal> so theres no way to change the limited length border?
[11:47:57] <taplar> next() ?
[11:48:27] <robertmaxrees> afaik you cannot target those psuedos
[11:48:46] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/he42tuy9/1/
[11:48:48] <robertmaxrees> since they're not actually apart of the DOM
[11:48:49] <jak2000> same
[11:48:51] <Sal> damn
[11:49:20] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: So I shall write my own event handler and check in there whether the event is already bound?
[11:49:41] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe did you read the links?
[11:49:52] <robertmaxrees> because that's not what they say at all.
[11:49:55] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: I had read those pages before
[11:49:58] <robertmaxrees> you need to use the delegated syntax of .on()
[11:50:02] <robertmaxrees> which you're not doing.
[11:50:20] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 works for me.
[11:50:25] <robertmaxrees> clicking links shuffles around.
[11:50:35] <jak2000> yes but the effect?
[11:50:45] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you need to add css to do those.
[11:51:25] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Ah so you mean e. g. $( "body .myElement") instead of $(".myElement")?
[11:51:29] <robertmaxrees> no.,
[11:51:39] <jak2000> mmmm then isnt not good tutorial :(
[11:51:41] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Then what do you mean?
[11:51:55] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/FhRJfz5.png
[11:51:58] <taplar> Sal: still here?
[11:52:00] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe this part of the docs.
[11:52:14] <Sal> yep
[11:52:25] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: isn't it the same I've told you in my last sentence?
[11:52:32] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe read the page please
[11:52:45] <robertmaxrees> you'll notice that second example is not like what you just asked.
[11:53:02] <taplar> Sal: try doing this.  create a css class like .something .col:after { whatever }  and try adding that class to your .grid element
[11:53:20] <jak2000> http://www.jquery-steps.com/GettingStarted#basic  never never tell use of CSS :(
[11:53:35] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe http://i.imgur.com/z6gkTJB.png
[11:53:55] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 it doens't include the css in the repo...
[11:54:00] <Sal> yes i got it
[11:54:06] <taplar> that work?
[11:54:13] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: And what's the difference to: $( "body .myElement")?
[11:54:27] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe the documentation i just screenshotted for you explains the different.
[11:54:33] <Sal> let me try
[11:54:35] <Sal> it could
[11:55:12] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe "On a data table with 1,000 rows in its tbody, this example attaches a handler to 1,000 elements: $( "#dataTable tbody tr" ).on( "click", function() {..."
[11:55:15] <Sal> something like: .grid .col:after{} and grid.red .col:after{}
[11:55:27] <taplar> sure
[11:55:28] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe An event-delegation approach attaches an event handler to only one element, the tbody, and the event only needs to bubble up one level (from the clicked tr to tbody): $( "#dataTable tbody" ).on( "click", "tr", function() {
[11:56:17] <robertmaxrees> i copied that information directly from the documentation screenshots i did for the relevant bits of .on()
[11:56:19] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Now I'm getting the idea
[11:56:25] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: But
[11:56:28] <Sal> or, i need another way to do it
[11:56:41] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: In my case we don't have something like the table. I have my body and I have seperate <div>'s
[11:57:13] <Sal> let me show you guys, so maybe you coulf give me a better idea
[11:57:15] <Sal> http://i.imgur.com/T7lkWG0.png
[11:57:19] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe that's fine.
[11:57:27] <robertmaxrees> if you read the docs, it explains everything.
[11:57:28] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: So what shall I do instead of: $('body .myDivClass').on('click', function() {..})?
[11:57:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:57:36] <Sal> to create the grid, i'm using a normal css grid with rows and cols
[11:57:39] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe why aren';t you reading any of this?
[11:57:49] <robertmaxrees> you need the second argument to .on()
[11:58:07] <Sal> then, to make the small little delimiter lines on the top letters area, i'm using col:after
[11:58:19] <Sal> do you think there could be a better way?
[11:58:26] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: So like this?: $('body').on('click', 'myDivClass', function() {...})?
[11:58:32] <Sal> i need it to be in % vecause it has to be responsive
[11:58:35] <robertmaxrees> fix that second arg, but yes JosefDe
[11:58:47] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: let me see
[11:58:51] <taplar> no clue on that jazz
[11:59:08] <taplar> maybe try ##css
[11:59:46] <Sal> i was also thinking on creating divs using jquery
[11:59:59] <Sal> so, i create 12 vert and 12 hor
[12:00:14] <Sal> and some start before others so they get to be longer
[12:00:29] <Sal> all in absolute positioning
[12:00:30] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Does that also work, if I call that instruction multiple times?
[12:00:37] <robertmaxrees> only call it once.
[12:00:39] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: o downloaded jsteps, and not work same as jsfiddle, how to convert the file with headers ?
[12:00:48] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe you only need to call it once in your code.
[12:00:56] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 huh?
[12:01:07] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: You see. You haven't understood my problemm
[12:01:24] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe you said newly added elements aren't being recognized by your event handler, right?
[12:01:36] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: At the beginning I've said, that I'm recalling the event-binding instruction, because I'm loading new data via Ajax, which also have to be bound to the same event
[12:01:47] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: correct
[12:01:50] <robertmaxrees> right, and you don't re-bind when using delegation.
[12:01:54] <robertmaxrees> you run the code once, never again.
[12:01:55] <JosefDe> aha
[12:01:57] <robertmaxrees> because you don't need to.
[12:02:01] <JosefDe> ok
[12:02:05] <robertmaxrees> that's why i asked you to read the pages I linked about delegation.
[12:02:08] <robertmaxrees> all of that is explained.
[12:02:08] <taplar> Sal: whats the user interaction with this element?
[12:02:36] <Sal> he can change the grid color
[12:02:56] <taplar> Sal: i've never used them before, but have you looked into using a canvas element?
[12:03:11] <Sal> and see, comparing same coind but from different years, if elemenst are in the same grid area
[12:03:26] <Sal> taplar, i had it in canvas before
[12:03:29] <HowardwLo> http://jsfiddle.net/cxhorfo5/2/ how do i select the next sibling with class “yes” if i have $(‘p[data=“first”].yes’) ? Basically I only know the first data attribute, and not the subsequent
[12:03:33] <Sal> but its hard to get it responsive
[12:03:38] <taplar> ah
[12:03:44] <Sal> you have to resigne the entire thing over and over
[12:03:50] <Sal> redesign
[12:03:54] <robertmaxrees> HowardwLo show us what you've tried.
[12:04:39] <robertmaxrees> HowardwLo also, that's now how you use data attributes.
[12:04:51] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: i know, its an example
[12:05:00] <robertmaxrees> then make a legit example?
[12:05:10] <Sal> let me try asking in #css
[12:05:32] <robertmaxrees> HowardwLo also, you cannot put divs in P tags technically.
[12:05:33] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Perfect!
[12:05:52] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: hmm.. actually not perfect
[12:06:05] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: The elements loaded via ajax don't react to click event
[12:06:16] <robertmaxrees> then you're binding something incorrectly.  show me your code.
[12:06:19] <JosefDe> oh wait..
[12:06:23] <JosefDe> :)
[12:06:23] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:06:36] <JosefDe> *silence* :)
[12:07:10] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:07:19] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: ya, just example :D http://jsfiddle.net/cxhorfo5/3/ here is what I’ve tried
[12:07:27] <robertmaxrees> HowardwLo ...
[12:07:31] <robertmaxrees> you cannot use data attributes like that.
[12:07:37] <robertmaxrees> that's not the correct format for them.
[12:07:43] <robertmaxrees> data-someName="someValue"
[12:07:45] <HowardwLo> yes i know
[12:07:46] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: It works :)
[12:07:47] <HowardwLo> this is an example
[12:07:51] <robertmaxrees> no, it's not.
[12:07:54] <taplar> a bad one
[12:08:00] <Sal> noway, in #css they're becoming all too sophisticated
[12:08:02] <robertmaxrees> it's not at all indicative of your use-case.
[12:08:12] <taplar> ?
[12:08:12] <Sal> if you don't provide a live sample, nobody chats
[12:08:21] <robertmaxrees> Sal because they need to play with it.
[12:08:25] <robertmaxrees> we're often the same way here.
[12:08:37] <taplar> except me, i'll talk to a door
[12:08:51] <Sal> yes, but one can also say, "try this or try that"
[12:08:57] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: so my example needs to be 100% accurate to reflect use case when I’m trying to learn how to use attribute selectors and css selectors properly?
[12:09:01] <taplar> ....not that i'm calling our wonderful visitors a door...
[12:09:05] <Sal> then if it doesn't work, then try providing a live sample
[12:09:16] <robertmaxrees> HowardwLo you need to at least give me valid markup.
[12:09:27] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise things won't work correctly.
[12:10:06] <robertmaxrees> also, you don't use .attr() for data attributes.
[12:10:08] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: how about this? http://jsfiddle.net/cxhorfo5/4/
[12:10:49] <robertmaxrees> closer.  so you want to get the next element with data-s ?
[12:10:55] <HowardwLo> i just want to know how to select the sibling given I don’t know the data-s attribute
[12:11:13] <taplar> so you want the next div.yes
[12:11:15] <robertmaxrees> use an attribute contains selector, though that's kind of weird.
[12:11:26] <robertmaxrees> var next_p = $('p.yes:visible', 'p[data-s="'$first_p_data'"]').eq(1) also - this isn't how you concat strings.
[12:11:33] <taplar> err, p.yes
[12:11:43] <robertmaxrees> but just select off the next element with .yes
[12:11:46] <HowardwLo> taplar: yes, i want the next sibling given i have the first one
[12:11:49] <robertmaxrees> or use another class on those elements.
[12:12:08] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: can i get to the next element without looping through?
[12:12:51] <taplar> you want the next() one?  to find out what's next()?
[12:12:55] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery next()
[12:12:56] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .next() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/next/
[12:13:04] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery get next element
[12:13:04] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .next() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/next/
[12:13:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cxhorfo5/5/
[12:13:44] <HowardwLo> oh
[12:13:47] <HowardwLo> that’s simple
[12:13:48] <HowardwLo> thank you!
[12:13:54] <robertmaxrees> google ;)
[12:15:24] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: another problem :(
[12:15:36] <HowardwLo> http://jsfiddle.net/cxhorfo5/6/ what if tis like this? wouldn’t .next() get the div after <p> ?
[12:15:56] <robertmaxrees> what do you think?
[12:16:12] <robertmaxrees> and there's that invalid markup again.
[12:16:15] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm hahaha
[12:16:34] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to use .closest() and then .filter() from there.
[12:16:52] <robertmaxrees> well, .closest() with recursive .next() calls 'till you get what you want.
[12:26:02] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: so i still have to loop around
[12:26:17] <HowardwLo> there is no more direct way to get to it/
[12:26:17] <HowardwLo> ?
[12:26:27] <HowardwLo> perhaps i’ll use xpath for this one then
[12:26:58] <taplar> with that last structure you have to extract yourself from the parent to then find it's sibling to find the nested element you want
[12:27:04] <robertmaxrees> HowardwLo this looks like crufty markup.
[12:28:01] <robertmaxrees> and don't use xpath :(
[12:28:24] <taplar> unless maybe you did something with finding them all, find the index of your self, and then go to the index + 1 element
[12:28:39] <robertmaxrees> that could work.
[12:28:47] <taplar> if you cached the all list might be faster
[12:28:54] <robertmaxrees> *will be faster.
[12:28:57] <taplar> boom
[12:29:03] <robertmaxrees> don't need to rebuild the object every time.
[12:30:36] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/nuqvLnj5/1/ On line: 9 - what's wrong? I want to get the .project-info section to get underneath the paragraph inside the .wrap, what am I doing wrong?

[13:36:00] <crit_commander> never mind data is a parameter I can set
[13:36:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:36:10] <robertmaxrees> also - why are you mixing callbacks with promises?
[13:37:14] <Pazician> Welcome back, robertmaxrees! Could you maybe check out what's wrong with my appendTo(), what am I doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/nuqvLnj5/3/
[13:37:36] <robertmaxrees> i explained this earlier.
[13:37:50] <robertmaxrees> what do you think 'this' is here?
[13:38:30] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I guess 'this' is the closest one that's triggered?
[13:38:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:38:43] <robertmaxrees> oh, hrm.
[13:38:51] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i was tripping myself up.
[13:39:34] <robertmaxrees> .closest() goes "up" the tree.
[13:40:00] <robertmaxrees> you're looking for a parent .project-info of each article.  which doesn't exist.
[13:40:06] <robertmaxrees> you want .find()
[13:40:17] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Alright, I'll try it out!
[13:42:09] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: My browser is like crashing and lags down with that code, is it right?
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused by what you're trying to do here.
[13:42:37] <robertmaxrees> wrapFa.click ?
[13:42:50] <robertmaxrees> wrapFa.on('click', function() { is also bad here.
[13:42:59] <robertmaxrees> let's start over here and do this the right way.
[13:43:23] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Alright, do you want me to explain what I want to do?
[13:43:30] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:45:32] <robertmaxrees> also - // Add a class to the FontAwesome icon when // the screen is smaller than 800 pixels - first off, don't do that.  use CSS.
[13:49:26] <Pazician> Alright, first off - I want to bring up an 'dialog' kinda looking section, that's the one called '.project-info' (that's the dialog), and that one has a trigger which is a FontAwesome icon called .fa-expand and when the screen gets into a mobile screen or let's call it in a responsive mode and should remove that FontAwesome icon called .fa-expand and add the FontAwesome icon called .fa-sort-desc in a smaller screen (everything below 800px) an
[13:49:26] <Pazician> d if triggered below the 800px it should toggle a class called .fa-sort-asc and show the 'dialog' kinda looking section underneath the paragraph inside the .wrap and it should just slideDown when the icon .fa-sort-desc is touched and when the user resize the screen again to bigger than 800px it should add the icon called .fa-expand and remove everything again, also the dialog section if it's triggered and showing - so basically when going bac
[13:49:26] <Pazician> k to a desktop view from mobile view it should remove all the triggered dialogs and be just like you opened the page after a load. Sorry if it sounds kinda fluffy, but I hope you understand what I want here
[13:49:30] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:49:33] <robertmaxrees> waaaay too much text yo.
[13:49:39] <robertmaxrees> i'm literally not going to read that.
[13:49:52] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Sorry, lol I was just trying to explain
[13:50:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nuqvLnj5/4/
[13:50:45] <robertmaxrees> start with something like this.
[13:51:08] <robertmaxrees> couple of things to keep in mind with resize events: 1. - don't ever use $()
[13:51:42] <robertmaxrees> 2. don't put any event bindings in the event handler.
[13:53:24] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: About the #2, you mean on resize I should never use .on('click'...?
[13:53:43] <robertmaxrees> or any other event binding.
[13:54:00] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Alright, gotya!
[13:54:17] <robertmaxrees> that event will get bound for every instance the resize event fires.
[13:54:23] <robertmaxrees> whioch means dozens of times.
[13:55:25] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I see, thank you for explaining. But now I do've event listeners in my resize, right?
[13:55:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:55:56] <Pazician> Yeah, the code you sent me - I'll go from that one you sent me, right?
[13:56:05] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot.
[13:57:05] <robertmaxrees> not guaranteeing it'll work, but it'll give you a place to start.
[13:57:45] <robertmaxrees> also, it looks like you're mostly just changing styles, yeah?
[13:58:20] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Hmm... Not really, I'm changing classes or more like, adding and removing them depending on the window width
[13:58:28] <robertmaxrees> right, and what do those classes do?
[13:58:33] <robertmaxrees> they change the way things look, right?
[13:59:00] <Pazician> Well, it's more like changing the FontAwesome icons, if you understand my point here?
[13:59:13] <robertmaxrees> my point is you should be using css media queries.
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> not js.
[13:59:35] <Pazician> Like working with display: none etc?
[13:59:43] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, sure.
[13:59:45] <arup_r> Why am I not able to select all checkboxes by a button click ? http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/qOOMea
[14:00:02] <robertmaxrees> arup_r open your console.
[14:00:25] <robertmaxrees> also, in js pls - not cs
[14:00:46] <arup_r> I opened my console. No error I see
[14:00:48] <Pazician> Alright, I see - but what about the replacement for the section on a lower screen? I want as I tried to explain before, I want to move the .project-info section underneath the paragraph, more like inside the .wrap section
[14:00:57] <robertmaxrees> arup_r open your console and reload.
[14:01:21] <Nialcen> Hello
[14:01:33] <robertmaxrees> Pazician sounds like you want resonsive styles and css, not js.

[14:01:53] <arup_r> nothing I see
[14:01:58] <robertmaxrees> arup_r i see $ is undefined
[14:02:14] <robertmaxrees> arup_r are you sure you're not filtering out errors?
[14:02:15] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I'll try do figure it out, I'll be back if I'm way to confused and lost
[14:02:24] <robertmaxrees> Pazician you'll want to head to #css in that case.
[14:02:35] <arup_r> let me see
[14:02:36] <robertmaxrees> Pazician js is the wrong tool for this particular case :)
[14:02:40] <robertmaxrees> Nialcen hello!
[14:02:46] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Alright, thank you so much for your time! :)
[14:03:03] <Nialcen> I have a small problem using this script http://pastebin.com/KAiJrU1A : it worked, but it does not any more. No error, but even the console.log for test does not trigger. Here is the page http://www.tree-of-savior.fr/simulateur-de-personnage/ ( green arrows arround masks )
[14:03:13] <Nialcen> Hello robertmaxrees
[14:03:28] <robertmaxrees> Nialcen huh?
[14:03:33] <arup_r> No I am not
[14:03:37] <Lehl0r> can someone tell me how i can get the second radio button in a document
[14:03:43] <robertmaxrees> arup_r that's the error i'm getting.
[14:03:48] <robertmaxrees> Lehl0r check out .eq() and .get()
[14:03:49] <Lehl0r> $("input:radio:eq(1)") ?
[14:03:58] <robertmaxrees> Nialcen i'm not seeing the greeen arrows.  make a fiddle?
[14:04:14] <arup_r> Where you saw the error ? in Codepen
[14:04:15] <arup_r> ?
[14:04:17] <robertmaxrees> arup_r yes
[14:05:08] <robertmaxrees> Nialcen also, where is your code on the page?
[14:05:46] <Nialcen> robertmaxrees : you see the character head ? Just above you have some costume mask, and 2 greens arrows, one left, one right
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> Nialcen yeah i see them now.  where's the code on this page?
[14:06:17] <arup_r> but why would it tell that $ is not defined.. I am not seeing any wrong in my code.
[14:06:23] <Lehl0r> got it thx
[14:06:29] <robertmaxrees> arup_r because jquery isn't loaded in the codepen.
[14:06:39] <robertmaxrees> arup_r http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tt219621/

[14:07:35] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[14:07:40] <robertmaxrees> is the relevant js in a document ready?
[14:07:50] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: o i see. I don't know how to add the plugin there..
[14:07:53] <Nialcen> Yeah, work in progress, will be moved in files
[14:08:15] <arup_r> Can I prevent the button to submit the form ? The select-all button shouldn't submit
[14:08:29] <Nialcen> Here is a dockyard Aha
[14:08:31] <robertmaxrees> arup_r bind a listener to the submit event on the form and preventDefault()
[14:08:32] <arup_r> I mean no idea how to add plugin codepen
[14:08:38] <arup_r> ok
[14:09:21] <Nialcen> robertmaxrees : no but as it was working, it was not in document ready too :/
[14:09:21] <robertmaxrees> arup_r http://i.imgur.com/fT0GgGh.png
[14:09:35] <robertmaxrees> Nialcen doesn't matter - your js is before your markup it looks like.
[14:09:39] <robertmaxrees> pop it in a document ready.
[14:09:43] <robertmaxrees> should work fine after tht.
[14:09:45] <robertmaxrees> *that

[14:17:27] <arup_r> changed.. But the code is working in codepen but not in my app code :/ None of the checkboxes are getting selected
[14:17:34] <robertmaxrees> check your console.

[14:21:24] <jak2000> robertmaxrees thanks
[14:22:10] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: why did you start ircing with your real name?
[14:22:40] <Uhkis> (assuming it's your real name)
[14:22:48] <robertmaxrees> it is my real name :)
[14:23:16] <robertmaxrees> combination of things.  keeps me more honest and a little nicer, plus i felt weird that there was no trail connecting my original screen name to my actual name, especially since I'ma mod.
[14:27:35] <claytonzaugg> Is there a default or generic loader from jquery?
[14:27:41] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:27:52] <robertmaxrees> gonna need to be more specific - "loader"?
[14:28:25] <claytonzaugg> like if I want a section of code to not appear until evertyhing is finished loading, like put a spinner type thing in its area
[14:28:51] <robertmaxrees> define "loading"?
[14:28:55] <robertmaxrees> like, external images and things?
[14:29:08] <claytonzaugg> like if I had a square that was loading a bunch of things, I don't want anything to show until it's finished loading and applying css changes, so a loading screen or image would spin and hide everything behind the scenbes if you will
[14:29:27] <robertmaxrees> not the way you're thinking, no.
[14:31:10] <robertmaxrees> you can do some tricks to make something kind of like that work, but it'll never be perfect.
[14:32:46] <claytonzaugg> Okay, thanks man
[14:33:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not really something i'd be concerned with, btw.
[14:33:14] <robertmaxrees> unless you're loading in things via ajax, then there are some things you can do that are pretty simple.
[14:33:42] <arc_> let the browser worry about when to display stuff
[14:55:50] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I got this, and it works pretty much as I wanted - the only thing is the .project-info that's disturbing my peace: https://jsfiddle.net/19d27uLn/ I can't get the appendTo() to work out
[14:56:15] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think .closest() does?
[14:56:34] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: It takes the 'closest' section called .project-info, right?
[14:56:38] <krambal> http://www.krambal.com/word-zoo/
[14:56:44] <robertmaxrees> right - what do you think "closest" means?
[14:56:45] <krambal> bewarned it may be loud
[14:56:53] <robertmaxrees> krambal uh, wat
[14:57:06] <krambal> i need to figure out why its not smoothly displaying the words
[14:57:14] <krambal> they flicker then fade in
[14:57:18] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[14:57:21] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Well, like I explained - it takes the closest element, or am I humbling right now?
[14:57:41] <robertmaxrees> Pazician right, so what "direction" do you think "closest" goes?
[14:57:44] <robertmaxrees> define that word :)
[14:58:04] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Hmm... It goes inside the 'tree' or does it?
[14:59:46] <robertmaxrees> it goes "up"
[15:00:00] <Pazician> Outside or does it go inside?
[15:00:04] <robertmaxrees> "outside"
[15:00:07] <robertmaxrees> parents of the node.
[15:00:17] <Pazician> Alright, I follow on that one
[15:01:38] <krambal> https://jsfiddle.net/070wqakh/
[15:01:42] <Pazician> So basically $(this) means the whole window, right? Then it looks for the closest .project-info section which isn't there, right? And then it tries to appendTo something that doesn't exist near that
[15:02:07] <Pazician> Or am I wrong?
[15:03:53] <zumba_ad_> folks, am I right guys that once we received the jsonp callback function we received from the server, our app will execute it?
[15:05:12] <robertmaxrees> Pazician $(this) refers to the current article.
[15:05:31] <robertmaxrees> .closest() goes to parent nodes
[15:05:32] <jak2000> robertmaxrees please congrats to me.... i now working with this wizard: http://www.wbotelhos.com/stepy/    i am happy :)
[15:05:34] <robertmaxrees> you want .find()
[15:06:30] <krambal> any ideas ?
[15:06:33] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Why does my browser hang on itself when I use the .find()?
[15:07:44] <robertmaxrees> Pazician link?
[15:08:11] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I'm doing it locally but I can get it up live if you want, hold on a sec
[15:08:15] <robertmaxrees> nvm.
[15:08:16] <robertmaxrees> got it.
[15:08:21] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle is fine with it.
[15:08:27] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Oh, alright
[15:09:04] <Pazician> It doesn't f up on jsfiddle or what? My browser lags the ass of when I use the .find()
[15:09:05] <robertmaxrees> do you want to append each .project-info to the sibling .wrap-all or to ALL .wrap-alls?
[15:09:56] <Pazician> I want to get them all inside the .wrap-all or .wrap, however it should get underneath the paragraph is the idea and it should only do that in the responsive mode
[15:12:46] <robertmaxrees> lol you're being too generic with your code is the issue.
[15:13:06] <Pazician> What you mean?
[15:13:58] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('.project-info').appendTo('.wrap-all'); literally says "find the child .project-info of the current $(this) and append to to all .wrap-all elements.
[15:14:48] <robertmaxrees> you want "find the child .project-info of the current $(this) and append it to the .wrap-all element in the current $(this)
[15:14:50] <robertmaxrees> see the difference?
[15:15:18] <Pazician> So I should use .children()?
[15:15:24] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:15:50] <Pazician> Why does my browser hang on itself when I use .find()?
[15:15:57] <robertmaxrees> re-read my first statement.
[15:16:04] <robertmaxrees> see why that might cause the browser to hang.
[15:16:33] <robertmaxrees> how many articles do you have on this page?
[15:17:53] <Pazician> I've just a static page right now, does it matter how many I've? I see now when I inspect the element, I get like many of the .project-info appended inside the .wrap-all and I just want one of them
[15:18:33] <robertmaxrees> the amount can matter - that can explain why your browser is freezing.
[15:18:47] <robertmaxrees> does the fiddle freeze for you when you use .find()?
[15:19:10] <Pazician> No, it doesn't - maybe it's bcuz there's only two of them
[15:19:14] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[15:19:16] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:19:17] <Pazician> Right now I've like 8 of them
[15:19:42] <robertmaxrees> that's an interesting use of that contraction.
[15:19:54] <robertmaxrees> and that might explain it.
[15:20:03] <robertmaxrees> either way, you want to appendTo() the current .wrap-all
[15:20:56] <Pazician> Hmm... How do I do that then?
[15:21:03] <Pazician> I feel like I'm kinda lost right now
[15:21:06] <robertmaxrees> find the .wrap-all that's under $(this)
[15:21:51] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('.project-info').appendTo($(this).find('.wrap-all'));
[15:22:33] <robertmaxrees> you basically need to make it contextual.
[15:24:28] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Ugh... YES!! It's working now, god - I'm so happy, you don't even understand how much I've been struggling with this, lol
[15:24:36] <Pazician> Thank you so much, robertmaxrees
[15:24:42] <robertmaxrees> do you understand the difference?
[15:25:00] <robertmaxrees> also - this really is something you should do with css.
[15:25:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing that .project-info is to the side of .wrap-all on pageload, but you want it to appear under .wrap-all on smaller screens, right?
[15:25:54] <Pazician> Exactly
[15:26:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, js is the wrong tool for that.
[15:26:08] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap does that out of the box.
[15:26:28] <Pazician> I did try to use CSS, but I didn't really work it out, since I would need to mess around with the position
[15:26:35] <robertmaxrees> or implement css.
[15:26:44] <robertmaxrees> javascript is slow and not meant for these kinds of tasks.
[15:26:45] <Pazician> Hmm... Never used Bootstrap
[15:27:05] <robertmaxrees> it's a simple tool for exactly these use cases.
[15:27:38] <Pazician> I'll take a moment and look at it, thank you again - really appreciated!
[15:29:52] <Pazician> One more thing, is it possible to get it underneath the paragraph something like this, but this one doesn't really work - it gets inside the paragraph instead of after it: https://jsfiddle.net/19d27uLn/2/
[15:30:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:30:59] <Pazician> Inspect the element and you'll probably see that the .project-info gets inside the paragraph, I want it to get outside it and appened after it. Do you understand my point here?
[15:31:14] <robertmaxrees> you want to insert after the element?>
[15:31:47] <Pazician> Yes, exactly - after the first paragraph
[15:31:58] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery insert after
[15:31:58] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .insertAfter() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/insertafter/
[15:32:04] <robertmaxrees> ^ simple google search ;)
[15:33:24] <Pazician> I can't get it worked out - am I doing it wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/19d27uLn/3/
[15:33:43] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:34:05] <Pazician> Lol, what's up?
[15:34:09] <robertmaxrees> read the code.
[15:34:11] <robertmaxrees> pretty obvious.
[15:34:21] <robertmaxrees> it's appending to the wrong place, right?
[15:34:29] <Pazician> Yeah, right
[15:34:36] <Pazician> It should be before not after?
[15:34:41] <robertmaxrees> so you're still using appendTo()?
[15:34:46] <robertmaxrees> also, read the docs.
[15:34:49] <robertmaxrees> they explain it.
[15:35:04] <Pazician> Alright, I'll check it out! Thank you!
[15:38:38] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I really don't get it how to add it to my current code
[15:40:43] <Pazician> I got this, but now it's adding all of the sections in the same https://jsfiddle.net/19d27uLn/4/
[15:45:12] <robertmaxrees> why are you using appendTo at all?
[15:45:21] <robertmaxrees> you want to insert something after something else.
[15:45:23] <robertmaxrees> not append to it.
[15:47:32] <zumba_addict> folks, a bit of topic but it was related to my jquery retry that I mentioned earlier. I think my grammar is wrong on this sentence. "How critical is it to have or keep the retry feature?"
[15:47:33] <robertmaxrees> Pazician like, read the code.
[15:47:44] <robertmaxrees> zumba_addict hrm?
[15:47:46] <zumba_addict> off^
[15:47:58] <zumba_addict> is it fine?
[15:48:04] <robertmaxrees> is what fine?
[15:48:06] <robertmaxrees> what was the question?
[15:48:06] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I do, and I try but can't get it right...
[15:48:14] <zumba_addict> robertmaxrees: the sentence I put in double quotes
[15:48:18] <zumba_addict> How critical is it to have or keep the retry feature?
[15:48:22] <zumba_addict> that one robertmaxrees
[15:48:24] <robertmaxrees> zumba_addict what retry feature?
[15:48:33] <robertmaxrees> Pazician $(this).find('.project-info').insertAfter().appendTo() ?
[15:48:38] <zumba_addict> ajaxPrefilter when a call to an endpoint fails
[15:48:45] <robertmaxrees> you want insertAfter INSTEAD of appendTo, Pazician
[15:48:47] <zumba_addict> it's going to retry 3 ties
[15:48:51] <zumba_addict> times
[15:49:09] <robertmaxrees> zumba_addict i'm way lost-  you want to retry an ajax call a few times?
[15:49:10] <zumba_addict> i'm suggesting on email to have the retry disabled due to the jsonp issues we've been encountering
[15:49:22] <zumba_addict> robertmaxrees: yes, it's already in place long time ago
[15:49:40] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: God.... Thank you more than everything... I feel so dumb, lol
[15:49:41] <zumba_addict> but they can't figure out the js exception issues until i found out today
[15:49:49] <robertmaxrees> zumba_addict i'm still lost.  sorry.
[15:49:56] <zumba_addict> i'm so sorry too
[15:49:58] <robertmaxrees> maybe start from the beginning?
[15:50:04] <zumba_addict> ok, really sorry
[15:50:39] <robertmaxrees> Pazician you should check out learn.jquery.com
[15:50:39] <zumba_addict> i was just asking earlier if my grammar was correct. This sentence "How critical is it to have or keep the retry feature?" I wanted to ask the team if it's ok to disable the retry feature we have in our application
[15:51:04] <robertmaxrees> zumba_addict oooh, you're literally asking if the grammar is correct, not for code advice.
[15:51:05] <zumba_addict> however, my mind thinks something is wrong with my grammar on that sentence
[15:51:09] <zumba_addict> yeah
[15:51:10] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I know, and I'm doing it - I was reading it before and will do more later today
[15:51:10] <zumba_addict> :D
[15:51:22] <zumba_addict> i feel like something needs to be added after the word feature
[15:51:42] <robertmaxrees> zumba_addict you could just phrase that "how critical is it to have the retry feature?", depending on context?
[15:51:42] <zumba_addict> maybe like this? How critical is it to have or keep the retry feature in place?
[15:51:50] <zumba_addict> k
[15:51:55] <robertmaxrees> you're way overthinking it, either way.
[15:51:57] <robertmaxrees> makes sense.
[15:52:01] <zumba_addict> ok :D
[15:52:03] <zumba_addict> thanks
[15:52:08] <zumba_addict> sending out the email now
[15:52:11] <zumba_addict> hahaha
[15:53:58] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: The thing is now tho, it's stay there even if I get out from the responsive mode - if the screen is wider than 800px it should get back to the old position and not stay inside the .wrap
[15:54:07] <Pazician> *stays
[15:56:29] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Here's an jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/kLx7c838/
[16:13:29] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I got it! https://jsfiddle.net/nuqvLnj5/8/
[16:30:52] <ceramicskull> What is the proper method to clone() a form elements and have it submit correctly?
[16:31:02] <chrisgeorge> When using a promise e.g. $.ajax.fail() why wouldn't an exception cause the promise to go to the fail method? In this case a JSON parsing error?
[16:34:23] <Krinkle> chrisgeorge: You shouldn't have to parse JSON inside an $.ajax() callback, but the reason is because there is a boolean contract about the promise you were given and what you application expectes.
[16:34:43] <Krinkle> if the .done() or success handler is firing, and producing its own error, that is not an error in the original request.
[16:34:50] <chrisgeorge> Krinkle: The error is actually happening before any of that.
[16:34:53] <Krinkle> It would violate the application contract to then also fire the failure handler
[16:35:29] <chrisgeorge> https://gist.github.com/chrisgeo/bfa501bfc3d75753e66a
[16:35:55] <Krinkle> The exception happens inside processInitStreamData?
[16:35:58] <chrisgeorge> That's an example, the error is happening upon return of the data, as .done is never reached (obviously)
[16:35:59] <chrisgeorge> Nope.
[16:36:08] <Krinkle> where
[16:36:13] <Krinkle> from jQuery itself?
[16:36:16] <chrisgeorge> correct.
[16:37:34] <chrisgeorge> In this case, the JSON being returned is invalid Krinkle (it has a Nan in it, don't ask). So the JSON parsing is failing and throwing an exception, but not going to the .fail method
[16:38:03] <Krinkle> Yeah
[16:38:28] <Krinkle> I think in this case it's a legacy decision from long ago. It's not an issue with the request or response, rather it's post-processing.
[16:38:46] <Krinkle> Nowadays you'd use .then() to create a new promise and proceed to parse there, which can then fail.
[16:38:49] <chrisgeorge> I'm just curious why/how to make it do so. I looked at overriding ajaxError but that doesn't seem to sit well with the promise method
[16:38:57] <chrisgeorge> Ah
[16:39:15] <Krinkle> e.g. fetch().then(JSON.parse).then( .. use data )
[16:39:51] <Krinkle> Fetch response actually has a .json() method in this case, but anyway, I think for now you're stuck with matching jQuery's model
[16:40:15] <jak2000> robertmaxrees can you accept a pm?
[16:40:17] <Krinkle> Overriding it would certainly not help interoperability with other code, or intuition for other peopel working with the code that know jQuery.
[16:40:21] <chrisgeorge> That's a bit disappointing, but expected since jquery doesn't really use fetch
[16:40:23] <chrisgeorge> Yup
[16:40:34] <Krinkle> Its' documented though, for what it's worth
[16:40:36] <Krinkle> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:40:41] <Krinkle> So you may rely on this behaviour.
[16:41:09] <chrisgeorge> I may need to, thank you for your help
[16:41:18] <Krinkle> If you expect invalid JSON to be a regular event (e.g. from user input) a try/catch would be in other. Otherwise it's kind of expected to throw an exception and bubble up further in your application
[16:42:09] <Krinkle> A last-resort window.onerror handling that provides some basic UI feedback to the user may be useful as well if you're worried about the UI freezing for an end-user.
[16:48:59] <ceramicskull> What is the proper method to clone() a form elements and have it submit correctly?
[17:06:55] <HowardwLo> #javascript
[17:08:56] <sadtaco> Why are jquery errors so bad? Bleh.
[17:09:18] <HowardwLo> : i’m trying to write an infitnite loop that has a delay between each iteration. Previously i did a setTimeout within the function, on itself. Is there a better way to do this without forking?
[17:09:31] <sadtaco> forking?
[17:14:16] <HowardwLo> sadtaco: ya it kind of blocks the first iteration by waiting on teh second, and so form
[17:14:17] <HowardwLo> forth*
[17:15:09] <sadtaco> You mean the recursive loop isn't accurate because of the blocking nature before it gives another time to loop again? You can use set interval.
[17:24:10] <ceramicskull> sadtaco: What is a proper method to clone() form elements and have it submit correctly?
[17:25:16] <robertmaxrees> .clone()
[17:26:04] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull clarify your question a little.
[17:26:20] <ceramicskull> yea but robert, the input ID's are causing it to try and submit from the form it was cloned from - so it's not getting submitted correctly.
[17:26:32] <robertmaxrees> you can't duplicate IDs on a page.
[17:26:40] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to edit those to be unique.
[17:26:53] <robertmaxrees> also, you'll probably want .clone(true) or .clone(true, true)
[17:27:00] <ceramicskull> Yea, I figured, but I was wondering if there was a proper way of doing it
[17:27:12] <robertmaxrees> the "proper" was is to not use IDs in this case.
[17:27:17] <robertmaxrees> why are you cloning the for,?
[17:27:19] <robertmaxrees> *form
[17:49:28] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees: I'm a/b testing a modal, so I wanted to just dynamically add it w/o having to spend to much time re-writing a form for the b variation.
[17:49:56] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad a/b test fwiw.
[17:50:08] <robertmaxrees> one's going to have more overhead, putting it at a slight disadvantage.
[17:51:11] <ceramicskull> yea, but the client wants it, so I at least got him to a/b test it before he just threw it on there.
[17:51:31] <Andrey> Hello
[17:52:01] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees: so is the best thing to do just re-write the form?
[17:53:29] <Andrey> Is there any difference between: jQuery.ready(function () {}) and jQuery(document).ready(function() {})
[17:57:06] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull i'd say.
[17:57:14] <robertmaxrees> Andrey nope.
[17:58:12] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[17:58:14] <robertmaxrees> err, wait.
[17:58:20] <robertmaxrees> jQuery.ready() isn't a thing iirc.
[17:59:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that wouldn't work the same way.  you need either jQuery(function() {}) or $(document).ready(function() {});
[17:59:25] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go.
[18:13:56] <Hilton> How can I figure out what the minimum required version of jQuery is for a plug I've written? Obviously I could just say v2.1 but for all I know it might work with 1.1
[18:18:24] <arc_> test it, or read the changelog
[18:18:33] <arc_> and then test it :p
[18:27:48] <Hilton> Thought there might be a version scanner out there, like there are for some libraries and tools. Supply source, tool sees $.on() used, it says you need at least 1.7.  Maybe point out you're using a deprecated function.

[19:12:14] <SemiNus> hi
[19:12:44] <SemiNus> could anyone please tell me why this does not work?
[19:12:45] <SemiNus> $('#foo').keyup(function() { if($('#foo').val().length >= 3) { alert('works'); }}
[19:17:16] <SemiNus> solved .)
[19:17:27] <SemiNus> there was a missing  );  at the end of the line!!
[19:17:29] <SemiNus> bye bye .)
[19:18:18] <zumba_ad_> what are the advantages of canceling an ajax request via setting the timeout value?
[19:19:34] <zumba_ad_> i'm not sure if it matters if my timeout is 30 seconds vs 60 seconds. I don't know what I gain if I use 30 seconds
[19:21:35] <zumba_ad_> btw, am I right that when Javascript is done with calling the jsonp callback function, it deletes it?
[19:38:53] <aro> is tehre a way with draggable to make a target div appear?
[19:39:03] <aro> like a box with dashed lines around it
[19:39:13] <aro> so you can visually see where the box will drop
[20:17:34] <definity> is this written correctly http://pastie.org/10413628
[20:20:53] <arc_> looks fine. whether the path is correct, or the selector, or the html, or the file, or whatever else, is another story
[20:21:51] <definity> arc_: hmm okay thanks :)

[22:59:42] <arup_r> It is giving always the button I clicked on
[22:59:52] <arup_r> Not the closest div Which I am looking for
[23:05:20] <guessx> arup_r what do you want the result to be?
[23:06:38] <arup_r> guessx: Actully I want when I will click on the select all button, all the checkboxed inside the div.container to be selected.. But that is not just happening.. so I was debugging.. and reach there..
[23:06:45] <arup_r> it seems all are messed up.
[23:07:51] <arup_r> In my browser console if I do ` $('.perm-checkbox').prop("checked", true);` it is checking out all the checkboxes, but when inside the click event I am putting it.. nothing is happening.
[23:08:52] <arup_r> There will be lots of such check boxes per div.container .. that's why I want to check through boxes which are closest to the clicked button
[23:22:09] <guessx> arup_r: for some reason it wouldnt let me do it the way i wanted, so i changed it to this: http://jsfiddle.net/yxjkbyto/
[23:23:14] <arup_r> let me try
[23:26:41] <guessx> arup_r: didnt really read the above, but with jsfiddle you hadnt made it load jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/gvLLbzno/
[23:27:26] <arup_r> guessx: I loaded it later .. and it works http://jsfiddle.net/g19dmmuw/3/ but not the same code in my app
[23:27:32] <arup_r> guessx: trying your one
[23:31:28] <arup_r> same issue
[23:31:50] <arup_r> the click is not happening ..or binding there to the selectall button
[23:44:44] <Kamuela> does jQuery get along well with react?
