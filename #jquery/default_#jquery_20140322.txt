[00:20:02] <wirehack7> hello
[00:20:14] <wirehack7> how to check if an img tag is in an specific element?
[02:07:22] <fugutive221> Hi!
[02:07:32] <fugutive221> I've got a scaling problem in Javascript/Jquery
[02:09:03] <fugutive221> http://jsfiddle.net/BmBE8/1/ When you resize the html window horizontally in chrome it will flicker at the right side. I think this is because of the scrollbar opting in and out since the white space is exactly the scrollbar width in chrome..
[02:10:11] <fugutive221> Which is also the same case in Firefox..
[02:43:55] <fugutive221> Could anybody help me with my problem?\
[02:46:02] <beancurd> just ask dude.
[02:46:16] <beancurd> if someone can help, they will.
[02:48:25] <fugutive221> beancurd I've got a scaling problem in Javascript/Jquery [10:09] <fugutive221> http://jsfiddle.net/BmBE8/1/ When you resize the html window horizontally in chrome it will flicker at the right side. I think this is because of the scrollbar opting in and out since the white space is exactly the scrollbar width in chrome..
[02:48:49] <fugutive221> beancurd I think it actually first 'thinks' like 1) I have to put the grey area underneath the red area so lets make a scrollbar 2) Oh the jQuery says it has resized so lets make the grey area width=bodyWidht-leftbarWidth 3) It comes next to the red bar again
[02:49:15] <beancurd> fugutive221: try turn on the scrollbar so it shows all the time. then see if it still happens?
[02:50:49] <fugutive221> beancurd It does help in Chrome and Firefox but not in IE since in IE the body works with decimals in the body tag...
[02:51:07] <fugutive221> How can I use floats in the calculations?
[02:52:35] <beancurd> no idea, get the coordinates of the element and use that?
[03:11:35] <seronis> i have an element like this:   <div>words <a></a> more words</div>.    I expected using .children()[0] to grab the first set of words but instead it grabs the anchor.  How do i specifically grab either of the text sections ?
[03:12:43] <joobie> guys, does this look wrong? $(this).closest('tr div.category1 input[name="category1reward"]').val();
[03:13:26] <joobie> ive got something like this <tr><td><input/><td><td><div class=category1><input name="category1reward"/></div></td></tr>
[03:13:46] <joobie> when you click the first <input>, im trying to get the value of the other input
[03:13:53] <joobie> im getting undefined atm
[03:18:44] <nils_> Can somebody have a look at an issue I'm having with a plugin? (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22518325/looper-js-plugin-images-invisible-in-between-crossfade-animations)
[03:19:47] <nils_> I'm sure it's a stupid mistake, but I can't find it for the life of me...
[03:24:38] <decx> seronis inline text isn't a child but just text in the element, grab all your text and split that
[03:25:57] <decx> joobie that's not how closest works, you look upwards the tree. so closest('tr') and then you can go down again closest('tr').find('input[name="category1reward"]')
[03:26:20] <decx> nils_ same thing happens when i use the looper example code, maybe that plugin is just shite
[03:26:30] <joobie> cant i just specify the exact reference to the input though?
[03:26:32] <joobie> rather than find
[03:26:35] <joobie> .. to reduce the i/o
[03:26:36] <seronis> didnt realize that.  then in the case i gave above if i grab the text its gonna grab all at once.  i need to be able to grab the text before or after the anchor seperately
[03:26:51] <seronis> testing now
[03:27:04] <decx> split() for that seronis
[03:27:48] <decx> joobie depends if you just have one of these on your site. if that is so, just use an id. but if there are multiple you need at least some relation between the two
[03:28:16] <decx> morning help gauntlet gets me awake. thx guys ^^
[03:28:45] <joobie> there's only one
[03:28:56] <joobie> but how do i format it?
[03:29:01] <joobie> $(this).closest('tr div.category1 input[name="category1reward"]').val();
[03:29:08] <joobie> that is the specific path to it.. dont work tho
[03:29:13] <decx> again, not how closest works
[03:29:15] <seronis> decx, how do i get it to split at the right location though?  the body of the anchor isnt included in the .text() call i noticed
[03:29:22] <decx> you look upwardsa with closest
[03:29:37] <seronis> the words dont have any identifiers to split on.
[03:29:42] <joobie> ok so how do i do it without find?
[03:29:45] <decx> take .html then
[03:30:16] <decx> if there's just one of these just use an id on your category1reward and call that directly joobie
[03:30:43] <joobie> thanks
[03:30:46] <joobie> ill just use find
[03:30:46] <joobie> cheers
[03:30:51] <decx> i now have enough waking power to keep standing in the shower
[03:31:07] <joobie> why couldnt u stand?
[03:31:46] <decx> i'm a terrrible morning person
[03:38:51] <Dirkos> is it possible to open a POST request in a new window?
[03:41:59] <nils_> decx ok...could you recommend another plugin that does similar effect?
[03:41:59] <puchacz> hi, it does not seem like a working way to install event handler inside iframe: $($("#browserIframe").contents().find(".bubo-highlighter")).hover(function () {});
[03:42:22] <puchacz> it does not trigger
[03:42:29] <decx> Dirkos the form tag can have a target attribute, so probably yes
[03:42:50] <decx> nils_ no, but looks like a fun project to just make yourself
[03:43:07] <decx> puchacz you have a typo there, double ) after your find
[03:43:30] <puchacz> decx: nope, I have double $(
[03:43:35] <nils_> decx I hear you, I'm just underpressure to make this thing work asap :(
[03:44:07] <decx> puchacz oh i see, well lose that stuff you don't need it
[03:44:22] <puchacz> decx: it does not want to trigger either way
[03:47:15] <decx> puchacz is the iframe on the same domain?
[03:47:22] <puchacz> decx: it is
[03:48:03] <decx> i havent used hover in years, isnt that deprecated
[03:48:16] <puchacz> what shall I use then?
[03:48:23] <puchacz> mouseover/mouseout?
[03:48:46] <decx> yes, mouseenter, mouseout
[03:48:52] <puchacz> thx, let me try
[03:48:59] <decx> hover the g http://jsfiddle.net/decx/ffukq/
[03:51:10] <puchacz> decx: nope, mouseover did not work either
[03:52:45] <puchacz> decx: I tried your way with on('mouseenter', function) - nope
[03:52:59] <decx> well your mistake must lie somewhere else then
[03:53:28] <puchacz> $("#browserIframe").contents().find(".bubo-highlighter").length ---> 94
[03:53:34] <puchacz> from console
[03:54:16] <systemfault> decx: mouseleave, not mouseout
[03:54:37] <decx> always the same mistake -.-
[03:54:40] <decx> good call
[03:54:55] <decx> but mouseout works too?
[03:55:12] <systemfault> Possibly... didn't try it.
[03:56:08] <VectorX> i have a .click(); action for a checkbox, and right below and alert to show the status, but the alert is showing the previous value
[03:56:30] <VectorX> is there a way to do some refresh after the click so that the alert will show the updated status
[03:56:35] <decx> ah, mouseleave for elements with children
[03:56:46] <systemfault> Ah, thanks :)
[03:57:01] <VectorX> $(this).parent().find('input[type="checkbox"]').first().click();
[03:57:01] <decx> but without children leave and out are the same
[03:57:01] <VectorX> alert($(this).parent("div").find('input[type="checkbox"][name^="dms"]').first().attr('checked'));
[03:57:04] <puchacz> decx, systemfault: ok, I will try to attach event handlers script inside my iframe; will it see jquery from parent or I have to include it as well inside iframe?
[03:57:14] <VectorX> $(this) is a <button>
[03:57:40] <systemfault> So .hover is something like myElement.on('mouseenter mouseleave', function(event) { if (event.type == 'mouseenter') { doA();} else { doB();} }});
[03:59:52] <decx> puchacz but it does work, there's something strange going on somewhere else
[04:00:06] <puchacz> how to debug?
[04:00:10] <puchacz> what to check I mean?
[04:00:52] <decx> well if you know how to check the length in the console you should find the error eventually ;)
[04:01:17] <decx> VectorX impossible to help you without knowing your markup. maybe set up a fiddle?
[04:02:21] <VectorX> decx i play with it a bit and see, it would take sometime to make the fiddle
[04:10:40] <VectorX> seems i should have probably been using prop('checked') and compared t/f instead of using .attr
[04:16:56] <seronis> var msginfo = $("<div class='Info'></div>");    is this a safe way to be creating new elements? its what is already used in a script im editing and it works. I just cant really tell the difference between it and a $('blah') meant to grab a currently exist element
[04:31:13] <the8thbit> If I use .load() to load an HTML file, and that HTML loads more js, is there any sort of function I'm supposed to put my code into? window.onLoad() doesn't work, likely because the window has already been loaded.
[04:31:47] <the8thbit> I ask because I want to access window.onresize, and when I try, the thing I'm trying to resize disappears
[04:44:05] <nils_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22518325/looper-js-plugin-images-invisible-in-between-crossfade-animations
[05:03:41] <ocx> hi can someone asssit me in this ? http://jsfiddle.net/cQ78v/3/
[05:03:53] <ocx> i want to remove the iframe and replace it with menu 1 when menu1 is clicked
[05:03:58] <ocx> the footer needs to stay in its place
[05:12:54] <ocx> anyone?
[05:27:58] <asturel> hi, i have a i have a table.. <tr><td id="1"><td nick="asd"></tr> .. how can i get the 'id' td in the another td? i tried $(this).parent().find("td[id]"); but didnt worked
[05:30:24] <peder> asturel: ids should be unique in the document, so $("#id") should return it
[05:31:17] <asturel> well i want to get in jeditable
[05:31:31] <peder> or... do you wan to get the value of the id from the td before the td with the nick in it?
[05:31:56] <asturel> yeah
[05:32:44] <asturel> http://pastebin.com/RRhjhf7T
[05:34:07] <asturel> the problem is that i have multiple tr-s so i cant just get it via $('#id')
[05:34:13] <asturel> i mean multiple tr-s with same data set
[05:34:21] <peder> well... if anything, the $(this).closest("td[id]"); would give you the td-element, not the id value
[05:34:34] <asturel> i want the html inner the td
[05:34:59] <decx> ids have to be unique, closest only looks upwards, get attributes like this .attr('id')
[05:36:25] <decx> also you can't have custom attributes, only data-*
[05:36:54] <asturel> well i have sets like <table><tr><td id="id">something1</td><td id="nick">nick1</td></tr><tr><td id="id">something2</td><td id="nick">nick2</td>
[05:37:06] <asturel> well i have data-something in it
[05:37:09] <decx> two id nicks is invalid
[05:37:20] <decx> identification
[05:38:34] <asturel> well but can i get the data-set within an element?
[05:38:53] <asturel> i mean if i use like this
[05:39:17] <asturel> well i have sets like <table><tr><td data-id="id">something1</td><td data-nick="nick">nick1</td></tr><tr><td data-id="id">something2</td><td data-nick="nick">nick2</td>
[05:39:51] <asturel> i mean check any elements have that data tag
[05:40:15] <decx> $('[data-key="stuff"]')
[05:40:23] <decx> $('[data-key]')
[05:40:29] <asturel> var nick = $(this).parent().closest("tr").find('[data-nick]');;
[05:40:31] <asturel> somethin like this?
[05:40:41] <decx> no need for parent before closest
[05:40:50] <asturel> ah right
[05:57:03] <ocx> when i add an addClass() do we append configuration to the existing class?
[05:57:39] <asturel> but find returns the the actual td, and data('dataname') didnt get the value
[05:58:10] <asturel> ah. attr('data-name') works
[06:00:40] <zth> is there any extension or service available that'll allow me to select and element on a page and "get jquery selector" or similarly, like the path you can get for CSS selectors with extensions?
[06:06:20] <decx> asturel it's data('name') to get data-name attribute or attached data
[06:06:58] <decx> i have no idea what you mean zth
[06:29:29] <nettoweb> guys, i have a striped table list with css and a remove a row with backbone, but the striped list breaks... is there a way to keep the table striped?
[06:45:17] <zth> i'm trying to remove a specific div with jquery on document load, but it's hidden via CSS (it's a collapsible). any idea how to remove it anyway?
[06:45:28] <Hounddog> Hey element.find('img') should i not get a list of img elements here then?
[06:45:30] <zth> i want it gone from the HTML as it contains some conflicting fields
[06:48:22] <shoky> zth: doesn't matter if it's hidden or not.. .remove() will remove it from the dom
[06:54:13] <sunbeam> Hi, I've got <div class="column"><div class="something"> ... more divs ... <div class="this_selected"> - when I have $(".this_selected") how do I find .column thats my parent?
[06:57:19] <shoky> .closest('.column')
[06:58:52] <sunbeam> nevermind
[06:58:53] <sunbeam> yep
[06:58:54] <sunbeam> thanks
[06:59:27] <sunbeam> is there a way i can make any element inside this_selected or this_selected itself that is position: relative to position: inherit ? with jquery?
[07:00:07] <shoky> you can.. if you really want to
[07:00:35] <shoky> better to use classes.
[07:03:18] <sunbeam> how can i do it with jq?
[07:03:27] <shoky> with classes ;]
[07:03:48] <shoky> .find('.class1').addClass('class2')  for example
[07:04:28] <sunbeam> ok thanks :)
[07:08:45] <puchacz_> guys, my previous problem with iframe not accepting events was due to a big div with z-index:50 atop of the iframe
[07:08:49] <puchacz_> but I have another problem
[07:08:52] <puchacz_> $(iframe.contentWindow.document).html(data.htmlResponseStr);
[07:08:57] <decx> haha
[07:08:58] <puchacz_> I wanted to set iframe's content myself
[07:09:01] <puchacz_> in ajax
[07:09:25] <puchacz_> decx: yeah, I wanted to have smart looking svg arrows atop of everything, but I won't go down this route
[07:09:37] <decx> if you want to send something into an iframe there's no need for anything js
[07:09:41] <decx> target
[07:09:58] <puchacz_> I want my server to return more than just html, so I used ajax
[07:10:06] <puchacz_> and have html in one field, some metadata in other
[07:10:07] <puchacz_> s
[07:11:18] <puchacz_> but the way I try to insert html into iframe does not work
[07:13:33] <puchacz_> ah, I did not mention that my iframe = $("#browserIframe")[0];
[07:16:29] <puchacz_> ok, done: document.open() document.write(myhtml); document.close();
[07:16:37] <puchacz_> decx: is it compliant way?
[07:21:04] <decx> that looks ugly and wrong
[07:21:18] <decx> like arsenals defending today ^^
[07:21:30] <dni> yep
[07:22:00] <dni> puchacz_: just change the src of the iframe?
[07:22:26] <puchacz_> dni: I want more information from server than just html, so I used json/ajax
[07:22:28] <ocx> guys $('#menu3_button').toggle(function() {     $('#footer_menu').css('height', '20px') }, function() {     $('#footer_menu').css('height', '40px') });
[07:22:45] <ocx> i am trying to hide when the user presses on that button
[07:22:51] <dni> and why you but it in an iframe?
[07:22:53] <decx> i think toggle is deprecated?
[07:22:53] <ocx> and reshow the menu when it is repressed
[07:22:59] <ocx> any idea what i am doing wrong ?
[07:23:42] <puchacz_> dni - iframe to display html, some other fields from json for further processing
[07:24:06] <dni> you can display html $('body).html(data)
[07:24:09] <dni> ;)
[07:24:52] <puchacz_> dni - don't understand what you are saying
[07:25:34] <dni> you want to display a whole page in the iframe?
[07:25:59] <puchacz_> dni - yes
[07:26:04] <puchacz_> and I have some metadata about it
[07:26:16] <dni> you can passt the iframe url parameters like src="index.html?id=1231" and then render the index properly
[07:26:33] <puchacz_> then I will lose metadata from server
[07:26:46] <ocx> anyone?
[07:27:10] <dni> pass it in the url
[07:27:20] <decx> which jquery version ocx
[07:27:45] <decx> the toggle method (not the animation one) is removed in jq 1.9
[07:27:46] <ocx> decx: 1.7.2/jquery.min.js
[07:27:47] <puchacz_> dni - the other way round - I want metadata FROM server INTO my javascript
[07:28:27] <dni> $.get('/metadata', function(data){console.log(data)});
[07:29:17] <decx> ocx well your toggle looks right so that should work
[07:29:47] <decx> maybe set up a fiddle so we can see it in action
[07:30:05] <decx> or lack thereof
[07:30:26] <ocx> position absolute always require   top: 0px;     left: 0px;     right: 0px;     bottom: 0px; ?
[07:30:53] <puchacz_> dni - it is not very convenient because metadata is being created when page is generated on the server, but don't worry
[07:31:47] <decx> position absolute doesnt require anything else, it'll just be detached from the document flow
[07:33:37] <ocx> decx: what do you mean
[07:34:46] <puchacz_> can $("#browserIframe").contents() have more than one objects in the array?
[07:52:41] <jay____> hello ben
[08:03:12] <hxm> hi
[08:03:19] <hxm> i have this http://jsfiddle.net/EqF79/ and I wonder why
[08:03:36] <hxm> when I select the textarea the datepicker doesnt appear
[08:04:09] <hxm> is it because is not a input?
[08:06:32] <printForever> hey guys
[08:06:54] <printForever> lookig for some help, I cant execute jquery script after ajax created elements
[08:12:13] <decx> use event delegation with .on() printForever
[08:12:24] <printForever> decx, I have, however no changes :(
[08:12:25] <decx> yes, datepicker only works with input hxm
[08:12:36] <decx> how did you do it?
[08:12:45] <printForever> $(document).on("click", "button#addtolist", function() {
[08:12:52] <printForever> then I wrote the function
[08:13:06] <printForever> and at the end appended the newtablerow
[08:13:19] <printForever> after append, Bootstrap collapse is not working
[08:13:22] <printForever> >:(
[08:13:23] <decx> can't tell without liveexample too many variables
[08:13:35] <printForever> to oversimplify
[08:13:39] <printForever> bootstrap + jq
[08:13:50] <printForever> jq script creates a HTML element
[08:14:00] <printForever> bootstrap is no longer triggering for new element
[08:14:32] <printForever> I was even trying to reinitialize bootstrap at the end of the jQ script, but I ended up screwing everything up
[08:14:48] <rofel> heya
[08:14:57] <Thav> does anyone know of any bugs relating to IE 10 and .on('submit', ..) ?  I have a page that uses that and it works fine in FF/Chrome, but IE refuses to run it.  It also doesn't seem to throw any errors, but I can't tell if that's just the "developer tools" being horrible.
[08:15:11] <rofel> is there a better way to check a radio button that on.click, e.g is there on select on on check?
[08:20:07] <erming> on change
[08:20:14] <erming> i think.. :>
[08:24:19] <hxm> decx: thanks, I can see the calendar now but only if I type manually in the firebug console: jQuery("#schedule_date").datepicker({showButtonPanel: true}); after write this and see nothing, I select the input again and it finally appears
[08:24:25] <hxm> what do I miss? document.ready?
[08:28:48] <hxm> nvm
[08:43:14] <hxm> can I add hour:minute to the datepicker?
[08:48:20] <Thav> I have some code that submits a form via ajax that works fine in FF/Chrome, but the handler doesn't fire at all in IE 10.   It's bound like this in the document.ready:  $('#form_id').on("submit", function () {...});  IE doesn't even attempt to fire this function.  what can I look for?
[08:48:57] <Thav> (there is nothing in the IE logs or javascript errors)
[08:54:30] <PDOjquery> I code in PDO and when I load my php page contents previous page was load starts after which just take care why?
[09:08:10] <puchacz_> newbie question please, how do I iterete through all elemetns selected in $("whatever")?
[09:08:15] <[-eXp|0siVe-]> Can someone help me out
[09:08:16] <[-eXp|0siVe-]> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22580000/jquery-selecting-multiple-classes-and-ids
[09:08:32] <puchacz_> $("whatever").each(function (e) {console.log(e)}); gives me indices not elements
[09:08:40] <systemfault> puchacz_: .use "this"
[09:08:45] <systemfault> puchacz_: inside the .each
[09:09:03] <puchacz_> systemfault: thx
[09:12:33] <systemfault> [-eXp|0siVe-]: Nobody can help if you don't give the HTML... The main reason for that duplication you have is probably bad html
[09:13:43] <Panni> Hey everyone could you help me with my code? ( http://jsfiddle.net/PmX5G/1/ )  If you click one of the words (one,two,three or four) a list beneath is displayed. From that list you can click on an option. This option replaces the word you clicked on in the text and the clicked word replaces the word in the list (Hard to explain, just try it) If you
[09:13:43] <Panni>  want to change the same word again it doesn't work or better the .click() funtion isn't called/fired why is that happening?
[09:13:55] <puchacz_> it is really css question I guess: can I put div "no higher than another element"?
[09:14:42] <puchacz_> I mean no higher than Y that I can read from another element
[09:15:00] <puchacz_> so Y < Y_given
[09:21:01] <shilon> hello there, Im creating a one page vertically website, with scroll to anchor content divs. Is there a way to fix bowser to the wrapper div of each area?
[09:22:57] <puchacz_> I think I know (answering myself) - I need to put the elements into div and set heights of divs accordingly
[09:25:30] <_lazarevsky> hello all
[09:25:39] <_lazarevsky> I need some help with bootstrap datepicker
[09:26:10] <_lazarevsky> if the user types in gibberish in the datepicker and tabs out, the default behaviour of bootstrap datepicker is to set the value of the field to the current date..
[09:26:18] <_lazarevsky> I would like to prevent this behaviour from happening..
[09:37:48] <[-eXp|0siVe-]> Joraid if you are in here, thank you
[09:37:51] <[-eXp|0siVe-]> you solved my problem
[11:28:50] <j1b23f> Hi guys, I'm having some trouble with AJAX. I'm using .$post to add posts under a video.
[11:29:09] <j1b23f> And once I do add the posts, I want to be able to click a like button to like it.
[11:29:31] <djangodms> I'm following this article and trying to get TinyMCE file upload working with a django site: http://pixabay.com/en/blog/posts/direct-image-uploads-in-tinymce-4-42. I'm also using another django app for autosuggesting tags to be used for the post. File Upload is breaking because of this file: https://dpaste.de/6wOa. when I remove it, file upload works but tags autosuggest don't. Could someone help these two play nice?
[11:29:52] <j1b23f> So one thing I need is to add the ID of the comment in the HTML somehow.
[11:29:57] <j1b23f> I use .data() for that purpose.
[11:30:20] <j1b23f> Problem is, once I post the post, and click it, it gives me "undefined" when I try to use the .data() value I set.
[11:30:30] <j1b23f> Until I refresh the page (and set it manually with ASP)
[11:32:15] <j1b23f> So in summary: I'm setting each comment's ID in the Like link by using data(). But when I try to use the data value I set afterwards (I .$post it), it's giving me undefined.
[11:33:05] <j1b23f> Could any of you tell me what the problem might be?
[12:00:09] <sunbeam> position: relative; will always be above position: fixed, right?
[12:16:17] <Schalla> Hello folks. I got a question, I am currently developing a basic click'n'function stuff, nothing special. My selector is now: #work_menu>li, now my IDE complains "inefficient jQuery usage" -> That is true and if so, there is a better way?
[12:47:17] <sunbeam> is there an easy way I can check with jquery if a certain element is still fully visible (when scrolling) ?
[13:17:26] <bengalo> jquery cant handle the scrolling very well either, so i guess not
[13:17:45] <bengalo> (from my experience that is)
[13:25:28] <amh345> afternoon, all.  I'm looking for a carousel library like this. http://projects.sebastianhelzle.net/jquery.rondell/    is there a specific one anyone can recommend ?
[13:25:35] <amh345> oh perhaps the one i linked is the best one
[13:32:54] <jdo_dk> Whats the diff on var data = $(this); and var $data = $(this); ? (i know the diff is $, but does it do any difference?)
[13:33:11] <bengalo> no
[13:33:14] <bengalo> people just use it
[13:33:19] <bengalo> to remember they are working on a jquery obj
[13:33:58] <jdo_dk> bengalo: THanks
[13:36:38] <zth> i want to use .remove() on a div with a specific class inside of another div with a specific ID. how would i do that/select that? i've tried $("#id").remove("div.class"); but that didn't work
[13:37:25] <peder> $("#id div.class").remove(); maybe?
[13:39:57] <zth> peder, i'll try it! :) i gotta read up on selectors. is it anything like CSS and selectors?
[13:40:18] <Schalla> Hello folks. I got a question, I am currently developing a basic click'n'function stuff, nothing special. My selector is now: #work_menu>li, now my IDE complains "inefficient jQuery usage" -> That is true and if so, there is a better way?
[13:41:03] <peder> zth: exactly the same ;)
[13:41:15] <zth> peder, ahh, it is?! :D
[13:41:46] <peder> yeah, think so :)
[13:42:17] <Schalla> zth: it is mostly. I think there are some more
[13:42:42] <Schalla> Recommend to read that: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:43:14] <zth> Schalla, thanks!
[13:44:09] <zth> for some reason, this doesn't work though: $("#content_tab_3 > div > div.create-account").remove(); <- i want to remove a specific div, but that's just not working. am i doing something obviously wrong?

[13:51:56] <fugutive221> Hi!
[13:52:06] <fugutive221> Anybody experience with LeafletJS?
[14:30:25] <drnick_naeluh> hey I have a javascript canvas drawing app and I have an option to save the image you made how could I save the image to my local directory on my server also at the same time ?
[14:30:42] <drnick_naeluh> I am using base64 image
[14:31:18] <sunbeam> I'd like to have a click(function() for an element that is added after page load
[14:31:20] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[14:31:36] <bengalo> check event delegation
[14:31:51] <bengalo> .on is your friend
[14:32:26] <bengalo> you basically add the listener to a parent element thats never reloaded
[14:32:36] <bengalo> and then specify what to exactly to watch out for
[14:35:34] <MrSavage> how do i pass data to a callback?
[14:35:34] <grumbleman> nigger
[14:35:49] <MrSavage> i'm trying to with $("#loadRoom").on("click", 0,($('#roomName').val()), getRoom);
[14:37:04] <sunbeam> bengalo: can you give an example?
[14:37:27] <bengalo> see above
[14:37:35] <bengalo> somewhat
[14:38:05] <bengalo> $('parent').on('click', 'yourdiv', function() { do this when done });
[14:38:29] <bengalo> check the docs for more
[14:39:48] <sunbeam> thanks
[14:40:01] <bengalo> MrSavage what info would u need that doesnt come from the supplied data / could be checked or retrieved in the callback?
[14:40:11] <MrSavage> i got it now
[14:40:15] <MrSavage> thanks
[14:40:50] <MrSavage> i assumed that the data passed would be only the data but it was an object so for: function(data) { console.log(data.data); }
[14:40:55] <MrSavage> to get what i passed
[14:54:03] <delboy1978uk> can anyone help with jquery validator? my date fields with custom validator is acting weirdly http://jsfiddle.net/3qL3C/
[14:54:56] <delboy1978uk> they have a dd/mm/yyyy regex validator on them. when you type the date in it validates, but on tabbing to the next field it says there is an error
[14:56:00] <delboy1978uk> the top date field is required, the bottom one is optional
[14:56:47] <delboy1978uk> could it be the regex itself?
[15:01:02] <delboy1978uk> lol it was the regex! took out the global modifier ,'g'  and it worked
[15:01:22] <delboy1978uk> the ol' rubber duck method, it never fails! cheers guys!

[15:23:27] <jenia> http://jsfiddle.net/B5ST9/
[15:31:25] <MrSavage> I'm having issues with trying to loop through every id with: $('#foo').each(function(n){console.log(n);});
[15:31:30] <MrSavage> it's just giving me 0
[15:34:56] <MrSavage> alright i changed it
[15:35:12] <MrSavage> but it's not printing all the tags with the same id $("#dropDownButton").each(function() { console.log(this.text);});
[15:36:36] <jenia> can someone please help me???
[15:37:03] <jenia> please tell me if im using the $.get correctlt:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22584504/java-how-to-get-parameters-from-get-request
[15:46:40] <decx> ids have to be unique MrSavage
[15:46:48] <MrSavage> i found out now
[15:46:53] <MrSavage> so i ended up doing a classname
[15:47:03] <MrSavage> and also can a tag have multiple classnames?
[15:47:11] <decx> yes
[15:47:19] <MrSavage> are they deliminated by space?
[15:47:46] <decx> i dont know that word but yes you put a space between them
[15:48:02] <MrSavage> alright
[16:07:17] <Tomashe> wondering something . im using children selector but why object.children("#x .text") give me nothing , while object.children("#x").find(".text") find element?
[16:07:34] <Tomashe> hey velveeta
[16:11:50] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: You probably want object.find('#x .text')
[16:23:45] * Velveeta pops his head up with pie all over his face, a la Mrs. Doubtfire, and says "HELLOOOOOOOOOOO!"
[16:24:23] <Velveeta> tomashe: i'm not sure when you said hey to me, but it's in my recent scrollback... i was at a neighbor's house helping him fix his wifi
[16:27:16] <tw2113> CHEEEEEEEESE
[16:27:44] <tw2113> CH CH CH CHEESEA
[16:28:49] <tw2113> i suddenly want a cheesea pet :D
[16:29:04] <Velveeta> that's so weird! because i suddenly want another mexican martini!
[16:29:16] <Velveeta> good thing i have one right here :)
[16:29:23] <tw2113> i've been downing Piraat ale for an hour or so
[16:29:43] <tw2113> 1 pint + 10% proof + empty stomach = party!
[16:29:45] <Velveeta> yarrrrrr!
[16:29:48] <Velveeta> nice :D
[16:29:57] <Velveeta> and i'm currently shopping for a new shirt
[16:30:24] <tw2113> i'm debating if I could afford a new android phone + a firefox os powered phone at the same time
[16:30:49] <Velveeta> after i saw this one that channing tatum was wearing, and cracked up... http://i.imgur.com/FPHjtr9.jpg
[16:31:03] <tw2113> because you know, i'm a firefox whore
[16:31:20] * tw2113 flips off Chrome
[16:31:56] <Velveeta> flip off chrome all you want... along with the IE crowd :D
[16:32:35] <tw2113> i don't bother with IE, i don't want to waste my time with a dead horse
[16:32:54] <jphase> I'd be a ff user but I don't like their dev tools very much and I can't justify using firebug, ever
[16:32:56] <Velveeta> you don't have to.. when it comes to flipping off chrome, you 2 are allies ;)
[16:33:13] <Velveeta> i'm not crazy about FF's dev tools either, i still prefer to use firebug over them
[16:33:15] <tw2113> chrome's tools confuse me
[16:33:26] <tw2113> their icon use makes no sense
[16:33:35] <Velveeta> it took me some effort to really get balls deep into chrome's devtools, but i do like them now
[16:33:51] <jphase> honestly even if ff had the simple autocomplete on styles in inspector I'd use it
[16:34:12] <jphase> yeah, just found the whole emulate iOS stuff in chrome dev tools the other day O_O
[16:35:51] <tw2113> the latest stabel Fx has auto-complete css properties
[16:36:07] <Velveeta> but does it have clippy?
[16:36:13] <Velveeta> because i require clippy for js debugging
[16:36:21] <jphase> oh, aurora?
[16:36:23] <Velveeta> "Hi! I notice you're trying to find that missing semicolon, maybe I can help!"
[16:36:36] <jphase> just downloaded that the other day, might use that more now :)
[16:36:52] <Velveeta> i heard FF has come a long way on its resource management too
[16:37:06] <Velveeta> and that they still don't have each tab isolated in its own process space, but that they're working towards that at least..
[16:37:09] <tw2113> i'm sorry chrome, but i don't associate a magnifying glass with inspect element
[16:37:14] <Velveeta> that was the main selling point for me when chrome first launched
[16:37:40] <Velveeta> only because you've been brainwashed for years into thinking magnifying glass = search
[16:37:50] <tw2113> and i stand by that association
[16:37:52] <Velveeta> but a magnifying glass for an inspection icon is perfectly semantic
[16:37:54] <tw2113> chrome is in the wrong
[16:37:54] <jphase> hehe, yeah their interface isn't the best - I agree. I use 100% keyboard commands in chrome dev tools so I don't really notice the icons
[16:37:57] <Velveeta> :D
[16:38:00] <jphase> isn't safari the same though?
[16:38:09] <Velveeta> yeah i'm pretty sure
[16:38:12] <jphase> webkit-general-icon snafu
[16:38:17] <Velveeta> their devtools started off as basic webkit implementations
[16:38:31] <Velveeta> and then safari stayed mired in the crap while chrome's usefulness exploded
[16:38:49] <Velveeta> and now we have like 37 different types of breakpoints, and network traffic filters, and all kinds of fun stuff
[16:38:59] <tw2113> safari tools annoy me more than chrome's
[16:39:11] <Velveeta> well yeah, because they're about as useful as chrome's were like 2 years ago :D
[16:39:58] <jphase> I recently got a tablet and with chrome beta you can plugin a usb cable and debug/inspect/console directly on your tablet from your desktop browser
[16:40:02] <jphase> that was pretty rad imo
[16:40:17] <Velveeta> nice
[16:40:23] <Velveeta> can you do the same w/ any android-based phone?
[16:40:27] <jphase> yes
[16:40:39] <jphase> granted, I rarely have to do that but it was kinda cool to remotely refresh, enter in jQuery into the console on your android devices, etc.
[16:40:55] <jphase> you just type in chrome://inspect/
[16:40:59] <Velveeta> nice
[16:41:01] <jphase> click "Discover USB devices"
[16:42:18] <jphase> I'm still a firm believer that my favorite browser doesn't exist (which would be a mutated love child of ff, chrome, and opera)
[16:43:04] <Velveeta> you mean, as usable as chrome, but with the next-gen css support of opera, and the fanboy-backing of FF? :)
[16:43:10] <tw2113> within the next few weeks i'll be moving from iPhone to Android
[16:43:16] <jphase> why, yes, yes I do mean that
[16:43:19] <tw2113> and if i can find a good moment, firefox OS too
[16:43:25] <tw2113> that'll be a 3rd device
[16:43:46] <Velveeta> tw2113: good luck with that... a lot of people either have way too hard of a time jumping over that fence one way or the other, or else too easy of a time
[16:43:52] <jphase> ff os is pretty dope. I talked to some of the mozilla developers working on that at OScon a year ago
[16:44:17] <Velveeta> people either say "BAH! THIS PHONE SUCKS, GIVE ME MY OLD OS BACK!" or else "HOW DID I EVER LIVE WITHOUT THIS, IT'S SOOOO MUCH BETTER" rather than a realistic sense of "this is pretty good, and so was my other one
[16:44:25] <tw2113> i have the samsung galaxy note 3 in mind, if i recall right
[16:44:40] <jphase> ahh, big 'ol phone
[16:44:47] <tw2113> i was originally on android for my first smartphone
[16:44:51] <jphase> fast and purdy and makes lots of watery noises by default hehe
[16:44:51] <Velveeta> i have a nexus 5, and have occasional issues, but can typically resolve them, if by nothing else, with a reboot
[16:44:51] <tw2113> then moved to ios
[16:45:13] <Velveeta> but i like not being locked into an ecosystem, that's my biggest gripe about apple tech
[16:45:44] <tw2113> as you may have noticed, i'm a firefox guy
[16:45:50] <tw2113> android allows for native firefox
[16:45:59] <tw2113> so?gotta move to that point
[16:46:29] <Velveeta> one of my coworkers the other day commented about getting some incoming message, and having 5 devices go off in his livingroom, because he had his iphone, ipad, work laptop (mac), personal laptop (mac), and appletv all go off
[16:46:35] <tw2113> i'm keeping the iphone for musical purposes?16gb of music eh?
[16:46:51] <tw2113> and it'd still work with wifi
[16:47:16] <jphase> I just like getting more hardware for less skrilla
[16:47:38] <Velveeta> heheh skrilla
[16:47:46] <jphase> should've said "fo"
[16:47:52] <Velveeta> fo sho
[16:48:01] <tw2113> yeah jphase i stopped by a nearby verizon place?the phone is as big as my hand
[16:48:03] <Velveeta> hey! who wants to see another 2048 variant!
[16:48:04] <tw2113> if not a bit bigger
[16:48:11] <Velveeta> just kidding.. i think i'm through all of them
[16:48:12] <jphase> yeah haha
[16:48:16] <Velveeta> tetris was the worst
[16:48:34] <jphase> those are pretty sweet though tw2113, I almost got one but I had to reconsider my wardrobe to support it
[16:48:47] <tw2113> from what i recall, i have seen tetris, flappy bird, 3D, and HN competition
[16:48:57] <Velveeta> 3D?! <raisin face>
[16:49:02] <tw2113> yeah, i've said i'd need a purse to carry a note 3
[16:49:03] <Velveeta> whar 3d version!?
[16:49:20] <Velveeta> oh .. my.. gawd.. afk
[16:49:27] <jphase> man purses are in this year, the euro fashion trend is coming back
[16:49:36] <jphase> or you could bring back the phanny pack!  (sp?)
[16:49:56] <tw2113> oh em gee phanny pack
[16:50:00] <tw2113> i have pics of me with one
[16:50:10] <jphase> omg you have to post those somewhere!
[16:50:12] <tw2113> back when i was naive and a pre-teen
[16:50:23] <jphase> it was neon yes?
[16:50:51] <tw2113> not that i can recall
[16:51:01] <tw2113> aside: woo! my 2 favorites in the top 2 http://www.sitepoint.com/best-php-ide-2014-survey-results/
[16:54:20] <Velveeta> shit.. i lost
[16:54:40] <tw2113> you prefer phpDesigner?
[16:54:54] <tw2113> or perhaps aptana
[16:58:59] <Velveeta> shit... i lost
[16:59:10] <Velveeta> php ide's?
[16:59:20] <Velveeta> the only one i've used is eclipse
[16:59:31] <Velveeta> i dabbled in netbeans for about a day, years ago
[16:59:46] <jphase> netbeans is a bit of a hog on my poor little macbook pro
[17:00:18] <Velveeta> although i don't really think of php as the type of language that requires a full-on ide, and it's probably just from (as much php development as i've done) a lack of experience in treating it as a first class citizen of application development
[17:00:20] <tw2113> i've had good experience with phpstorm for proper IDEs
[17:00:29] <jphase> oh whoops, I meant phpstorm
[17:00:30] <Velveeta> i've heard great reviews of phpstorm actually
[17:00:40] <Velveeta> from the webstorm folks
[17:00:54] <Velveeta> well, the reviews weren't from the webstorm folks, but the ide..
[17:00:57] <jphase> it was a bit overwhelming to learn phpstorm but I could tell it had a lot of dope things with it
[17:01:32] <Velveeta> and the people that write intellij, i believe they have a php flavor, though i've heard intellij rules them all
[17:01:32] <jphase> but autocompletion on it while running photoshop and apache locally and 12 tabs in my browser and pandora ended up proving frustrating
[17:02:27] <Velveeta> the only time i ever really loved using eclipse was years ago in a former job, when one of our devs got xdebug configured properly for it so that we could step through our server-side code from the ide to debug it
[17:02:45] <Velveeta> that made things 1000x better... and it was such a PITA to configure that i was never able to do it myself after that
[17:02:55] <tw2113> phpstorm 8 has WP support built in from what i've seen recently
[17:05:30] <Velveeta> it's been a while since i posted a js article..... i need to figure out what my next topic is gonna be...
[17:06:18] <Velveeta> and then i need to figure out how to get it published by dailyjs
[17:06:45] <systemfault> Velveeta: ES5-style prototypal inheritance.
[17:06:49] <systemfault> :)
[17:07:00] <jphase> tw2113: do you use phpstorm as your main IDE for wp stuffs?
[17:07:00] <Velveeta> i can't remember if i've done that one already or not
[17:07:15] <Velveeta> i do have an entire post dedicated to object instances vs prototypes
[17:07:23] <systemfault> Velveeta: I knew you had a blog... but you never gave me the url :P
[17:07:27] <tw2113> i have a few full sites as projects in it
[17:07:30] <tw2113> but i don't use it exclusively
[17:07:33] <Velveeta> oh whoops
[17:07:45] <Velveeta> here, this is my post on prototypes: http://conqueringtheclient.com/object-prototypes/
[17:07:46] <tw2113> if it's quick edit stuff then i just use sublime
[17:08:01] <tw2113> if it's a dedicated project say BadgeOS, then i use phpstorm
[17:08:43] <jphase> I have a small fear of anything that does things like version control for me or takes me out of the terminal shy of just editing lines of code.
[17:08:49] <systemfault> Velveeta: Not bad, but you're using new :/
[17:09:11] <Velveeta> well yeah, that was in the context of using a prototype as part of an object constructor ;)
[17:09:20] <Velveeta> oh, i know what i can write on now!
[17:09:36] <Velveeta> i haven't written any articles yet about specific patterns other than some MVVM dabbling i wrote about
[17:09:53] <Velveeta> but yeah, i prefer the factory pattern to the constructor pattern in some cases
[17:09:58] <systemfault> I had in mind using object.create.. that kind of stuff
[17:10:03] <Velveeta> but constructors definitely have their place
[17:10:17] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha, let me check caniuse for object.create support
[17:10:24] <tw2113> jphase, phpstorm has a terminal built in
[17:10:34] <systemfault> IE9 and later :P (For Object.create)
[17:10:58] <Velveeta> yep, i was in the beginning of typing out that MDN shows IE9+
[17:10:59] <jphase> oh I just mean my iTerm 2 that I've pimped out with tons of .bash_profile and .bashrc stuff
[17:11:11] <Velveeta> i try to stick to *fairly* cross-browser coverage in my code samples
[17:11:22] <Velveeta> but god i can't wait until we can throw away IE10-
[17:11:35] <jphase> amen
[17:11:43] <systemfault> Velveeta: yeah :/ Unfortunately, we're stuck with IE8 forever...
[17:11:48] <jphase> no no no
[17:11:57] <Velveeta> i'm looking forward to object.defineProperties for custom getter and setter, and object.observe, which isn't gonna be around for a while still
[17:12:18] <jphase> same thing was said about IE6 - IE8 is EOL in a few days
[17:12:21] <jphase> thank the lord
[17:12:24] <Velveeta> yeah, we'll be scrapping IE7 support in 2-3 weeks at my company, for the most part, but yeah, we'll be stuck with 8 for at least a few more years
[17:12:41] <systemfault> Velveeta: Waiting for ES6 arrows/let/Object.assign
[17:12:51] <tw2113> i doubt we're escaping XP any time soon
[17:13:04] <Velveeta> yeah, i like the idea of let, but i've gotten so used to js scoping, that it almost seems an overoptimization at this point :D
[17:13:12] <jphase> I just show our clients the acid3 test in IE8 and tell them "24% of 100% = 76% additional cost for supporting this browser" :\
[17:13:25] <jphase> they end up making the decision on their own at that point
[17:13:26] <Velveeta> i came from a C background, so originally i was like "what do you mean no block level? that's ridiculous" and then i just got used to it :D
[17:13:42] <Velveeta> jphase: 24% of the time, it works every time...
[17:13:51] <jphase> hah
[17:14:01] <tw2113> ooh stats online
[17:14:03] <systemfault> Velveeta: JS was painful for me... I had a C++ background and JS was my first language with dynamic typing...
[17:14:29] <systemfault> Velveeta: So when I started, I was putting "guards" at the beginning of all my functions (is it of the proper type.. etc)
[17:14:46] <Velveeta> i was learning php and js side by side, so the dynamic typing didn't hit me too hard, and now i love it.. i consider strongly-typed languages to be a little handicapped in that regard :D
[17:15:17] <Velveeta> i can totally see the use for them in large-scale applications with tons of custom data types
[17:15:28] <systemfault> I hated JS soooo much... I guess that now, I just suffer from a programmer's version of the stockholm syndrome.
[17:15:33] <Velveeta> but i also feel like as a developer, with well-documented and clearly-readable code, typing is really just a formality
[17:15:40] <Velveeta> lol
[17:15:51] <systemfault> !js
[17:15:58] <systemfault> Do we still have a bot?
[17:16:11] <Velveeta> yeah, over the last 2 years or so, my js skills have ramped up so much, and i've started seeing it as a really elegant language once you know how to write it properly
[17:16:45] <Velveeta> i came onto this job already thinking i was a js badass, and realized how little i actually knew, which was good, because that's stuck with me
[17:17:03] <Velveeta> i've had to constantly keep learning web technologies because i constantly feel now that i just don't know enough
[17:17:35] <Velveeta> in fact one of my blog posts is titled "never stop learning!" because of that concept
[17:18:00] <jphase> I have so much to learn with js and jQuery still it's not even fair, and I'm the biggest jQuery/js dork out of anyone in my circle that I know
[17:18:35] <jphase> I appreciate the schooling I get from here from time to time :)
[17:18:37] <systemfault> Velveeta: I had revelation with C++... started learning it... thought I was becoming good then found out about boost... metaprogramming... etc... I learned that I didn't know shit.
[17:19:03] <Velveeta> i've gotten really well-versed in jquery, which only highlights my lack of knowledge in other scopes, like backbone/marionette/angular/ionic/knockout/ember/riot/adinfinitum
[17:19:36] <Velveeta> systemfault: it's humbling when you go from that level of "i'm so fucking awesome that any company would be lucky to even glance at my resume" to "i'm lucky to be employed" :D
[17:19:43] <jphase> my nerd boner for node is to the point of raging and uncontrollable these days :\
[17:20:02] <systemfault> I love node, not sure why would anyone do PHP.
[17:20:10] <systemfault> Masochism?
[17:20:24] <Velveeta> yeah, i'm nowhere near as versed in node as i would like to be... as much as i understand the *concept* of streams and piping, i know very little about the implementation of them
[17:20:33] <Velveeta> lol masochism
[17:20:33] <jphase> well I think it's tough for folks to wrap their heads around async stuff coming from php tbh
[17:20:40] <systemfault> I still prefer Java for "important stuff"... </hide>
[17:20:57] <Velveeta> there was a php framework i used to work with that was very hipster-esque, and i loved the shit out of it, back in the day, called coughphp
[17:20:57] <jphase> hey now, can't knock a language that.will.never.freaking.die.ever
[17:21:08] <jphase> (yes the dot syntax was pun-intended)
[17:21:18] <systemfault> :)
[17:21:28] <jphase> I learned oop in java so I can't knock it
[17:21:36] <Velveeta> it was developed by a group of badasses i used to work with at academic superstore, but then the whole team was scattered to the 4 corners of the earth through layoffs and better offers and whatnot, and the project died out
[17:22:12] <Velveeta> jphase: async programming was one of the more difficult concepts for me to wrap my head around, and the introduction of promises in jquery 1.5 helped to mitigate that
[17:22:14] <jphase> I also have an old love for Oracle from taking OCA training
[17:22:36] <jphase> yeah, I learned node first and then realized what promises were shortly after that
[17:22:41] <Velveeta> i have a really good blog post about promises that's posted on our company's internet blog, i keep meaning to clean it up and publish it on my own blog, but never do
[17:22:47] <jphase> I've read it
[17:22:54] <systemfault> I can't live without promises in node....
[17:23:03] <jphase> sorry if that sounds creepy, but you linked it like 5 months ago
[17:23:08] <systemfault> I use the bluebird implementation these days.
[17:23:14] <jphase> maybe less
[17:23:28] <Velveeta> well i can't have linked our internal blog, but i must've had another blog post that delved into them also
[17:23:55] <jphase> oh, possibly not the same one, I've read parts of your blog you linked earlier
[17:23:56] <Velveeta> and don't ever worry about sounding creepy for reading my shit, that's what i put it out there for :D
[17:24:24] <Velveeta> systemfault: i typically use Q in node, and it took me some getting used to also, coming from jquery promises
[17:24:36] <jphase> yeah, I only blog on super specific stuff that's annoying like "How to install Gitlab 6.6.5 on CentOS 6.5 64bit" and things that have given me headaches
[17:24:49] <Velveeta> that's good too
[17:24:59] <Velveeta> because when i have specific problems, those are the ones i look for
[17:25:07] <Velveeta> "oh YES, that's the exact version i'm having issues with!"
[17:25:20] <systemfault> Velveeta: I was using Q before... but found that bluebird is faster(I don't care though), has better error messages and some nice functionality (cancelable promises, catch with error types... etc)
[17:25:26] <jphase> same here, I blog on unsuccessful google searches that I force myself to figure out on my own and give back to the community
[17:25:36] <Velveeta> oh man, cancelable promises would be great
[17:26:00] <Velveeta> because when i set up a $.when-type of aggregate promise, and dynamically add to that array of promises, it would be nice to cancel the old stack and reimplement the new one
[17:26:54] <Velveeta> i was talking in here the other day about rolling out a new internal educational series at work
[17:27:10] <Velveeta> we have a variety of front-end engineers in our personnel stack
[17:27:15] <systemfault> Velveeta: These things are really difficult to implement in most companies.
[17:27:18] <Velveeta> from entry-level to senior architects
[17:27:36] <Velveeta> and being able to horizontally ramp up the lower levels to multiply output is a total bonus
[17:27:48] <systemfault> Right :)
[17:27:58] <Velveeta> systemfault: we've a couple of successful go-rounds so far, we have a FEE 101 and FEE 201 course we've put on previously with success
[17:28:19] <Velveeta> the FEE 101 course was targeted as entry-level for some of our backend engineers that wanted to strengthen their client-side skills
[17:28:31] <systemfault> Nice :)
[17:28:36] <Velveeta> FEE 201 was targeted at backend guys also, with some concession for existing front end people
[17:28:55] <Velveeta> but i used to host a series for my own product team that i called UXU (UX university, uh hyuck!)
[17:29:04] <systemfault> Haha
[17:29:09] <Velveeta> that i want to roll out organization-wide
[17:29:34] <Velveeta> so it would be inclusive of lower-level FEE's and backend people (SE's) that want to learn things like various pattern implementations in js, etc
[17:29:44] <Velveeta> and what scenarios are better suited to what patterns, etc
[17:30:00] <Velveeta> i think the SE's will latch onto those topics a lot more, typically coming from a more CS-oriented background
[17:30:06] <Velveeta> FEE's are typically a lot more home-grown
[17:30:15] <systemfault> Yeah...
[17:30:17] <Velveeta> but that means they have even more to gain from those lessons
[17:30:57] <systemfault> I was personally "forced" into frontend.
[17:31:12] <Velveeta> and then if i do well enough, maybe one day i can own my own bocoup.com :D
[17:31:38] <Velveeta> jquery itself got me into the concept of a specialized front end person
[17:31:56] <systemfault> It was YUI 3 for me.... 4 years ago
[17:32:12] <Velveeta> coming from a background of full-stack dev that dabbled in js, and knowing what a PITA it was, and what jquery provided that eased that, helped me strengthen myself in that arena, and then specialize in it
[17:32:17] <Velveeta> nice
[17:32:36] <Velveeta> YUI was one i always wanted to pick up (along w/ dojo and extjs) and never found the time/inclination to after jquery :)
[17:32:39] <systemfault> I hated jQuery back in the day.... found it had a shit API.
[17:32:52] <systemfault> But nowadays, I think they removed most of what I hated from it.
[17:33:10] <systemfault> .on is nice... no more .delegate/.live/.bind/.click/change...etc.
[17:33:24] <Velveeta> yeah there's been a lot of trimming of the fat over time, collapsing of disparate functions into single entrypoints (like .on vs .bind/delegate/live), and a lot of useful additions
[17:33:26] <Velveeta> right
[17:33:28] <systemfault> Promise-based XHR and animations...
[17:33:32] <Velveeta> absolutely
[17:33:43] <Velveeta> and document.ready implementation using promises
[17:33:55] <systemfault> Wait what?
[17:34:05] <Velveeta> yeah, document.ready is implemented using promises also
[17:34:20] <systemfault> How do you use it?
[17:34:22] <Velveeta> so 2 minutes after page load, you can bind to document.ready and have your callback executed immediately
[17:34:30] <Velveeta> it's just using a promise to track state of dom ready
[17:34:32] <systemfault> Ahhhh.. that
[17:34:34] <Velveeta> right
[17:34:49] <Velveeta> that's what i like about promises, they're a run-once state-tracking machine
[17:34:54] <systemfault> I thought for a second that something like $(document).ready().then(function() {})
[17:34:58] <Velveeta> like a persistent if/else check
[17:35:04] <systemfault> *existe
[17:35:05] <systemfault> d
[17:35:07] <Velveeta> ahhhhh, well, i don't know if you can do that or not ;)
[17:35:12] <systemfault> Probably not :P
[17:35:30] <Velveeta> afk a few minutes, i gotta get some charcoal going
[17:35:35] <Velveeta> and mix another drink
[17:35:40] <systemfault> :P
[17:35:46] <Velveeta> alcohol + fire = win
[17:39:34] <tw2113> i'm nursing a belhaven wee heavy pint at the moment
[17:39:42] <tw2113> anything after this will be peach flavored whisky
[17:43:39] <Velveeta> oh man belhaven is some yummy stuff
[17:44:05] <Velveeta> i'm gonna go take a quick bikeride, to tempt the gods of DUI-on-bike and to burn off some of this booze, and then i shall be back with more booze
[17:44:13] <Velveeta> 10 minutes or so, power DUI-on-bike!
[17:52:33] <ctruett> How can I get the width of an element after it is resized by the browser according to flexbox rules?
[17:52:49] <ctruett> For some reason my script is pulling in the values pre-flexbox
[17:52:52] <erming> have you tried .outerWidth()?
[17:52:59] <ctruett> nope, I'll try that
[17:53:43] <ctruett> hmm, outerWidth is doing the same thing
[17:55:01] <erming> i wonder if you could "cheat" it by wrapping something around it, or something like that
[17:55:03] <erming> and then measure the container
[17:55:21] <Velveeta> is there such a thing as pre- and post-flexbox? is that not an atomic sizing property?
[17:55:37] <ctruett> I'm not sure what you mean by atomic
[17:55:38] <Velveeta> also, if that's the case, have you tried outerWidth(true) just out of curiosity
[17:56:03] <Velveeta> i mean like the difference between changing something from display: inline to display: block is that there's no pre- or post- operation, it either is or it isn't
[17:56:30] <Velveeta> i would think that there isn't something that says like "this is the size of this element prior to its flexbox box-sizing taken into account, and the is the size after that's taken into account"
[17:56:36] <ctruett> oh, right. by 'pre / post flexbox' i meant after the browser has done all my css stuffs related to flexbox
[17:57:06] <ctruett> what jQuery is pulling in right now is the size as if flexbox was not applied at all
[17:57:22] <Velveeta> right, but i would think the browser taking that stuff into account would be an atomic operation, as in, it just *is* that size, regardless of the properties that make it that size.. is that not the case?
[17:57:28] <Velveeta> interesting..
[17:57:59] <Velveeta> can you set us up an example is something like jsbin or jsfiddle?
[17:58:08] <Velveeta> that shows a before/after calculation of width?
[17:58:20] <Velveeta> and let us know if there's a specific browser we need to view it in to see that behavior
[17:58:32] <ctruett> maybe, what I am working with is moderately complex
[17:59:03] <Velveeta> well if it boils down to a box-sizing property, that should be a fairly simple example to recreate.. it doesn't need to be the full scope of what you have going on, if you can isolate it to one property's behavior
[18:00:14] <ctruett> The problem is more that I am doing the project in SASS / CoffeeScript, so it all gets preprocessed and would then be annoying to try and sort through to put it in a jsbin
[18:00:17] <ctruett> i'll take a look through
[18:01:03] <ctruett> Oh nice, jsbin does coffeescript
[18:01:04] <Velveeta> well yeah, that'll be precompiled into valid css, but you should be able to take that valid css and recreate it in a jsbin/jsfiddle example, if you know that it's the box-sizing property that's throwing calculations off..
[18:01:11] <Velveeta> oh wow, i didn't know that
[18:01:16] <Velveeta> +1 for learning! :D
[18:01:23] <ctruett> ^^
[18:01:44] <Velveeta> afk checking on coals
[18:08:16] <Velveeta> ok, rum and coke, do your worst!
[18:08:33] <Velveeta> i got my heartburn meds in me, and i dare you
[18:09:47] <systemfault> :)
[18:11:30] <ctruett> well, here's some sort of JSbin
[18:11:30] <ctruett> http://jsbin.com/qucuniqu/1/
[18:11:48] <ctruett> im calling a chart library, which is the issue here, and for some reason that does not show up in the jsbin
[18:12:01] <ctruett> but maybe that will help, though i doubt it
[18:12:28] <ctruett> OH
[18:14:05] <ctruett> reload that -- added a script it needed.
[18:20:15] <Tomashe> BillCriswell: im trying to make my preformaces better and i read somewhere its better use children then find
[18:28:55] <jphase> Tomashe: if you know it's a direct child then definitely use children as find is recursive
[18:32:31] <decx> find is faster on light markup though
[18:52:51] <jl2753> hi guys, what's the best way to take out href value and replace it after ajax call? something like  var elementLink = $(data).find('#someelement').attr('href'); $('#someelement').attr('href', elementLink); ?
[18:58:21] <jphase> jl2753: If you need to grab the href of an element from the ajax response then that will work so long as "data" is parsed HTML.
[19:01:49] <jphase> if you're using .get, for example, you'll need to make sure that the data you're getting only has tags from within the <body> of an html document.
[19:09:03] <jl2753> jphase: cool, thanks!
[21:03:22] <Onionnion> What's wrong with using $(this) in this case? http://jsfiddle.net/eL7pp/
[21:05:01] <Onionnion> or why doesn't that work maybe I should ask instead
[21:05:51] <Mattx> Hello
[21:06:20] <Mattx> can you think of any workaround? I have a string like "<div id='foo'>{whatever}</div>"
[21:06:53] <Mattx> and I want to replace "{whatever}" by $("<span>foo bar</span>")
[21:08:07] <Mattx> the problem is that the span is an object and I don't want to lose its associated events
[21:10:13] <Mattx> anyone around?
[21:10:44] <Onionnion> Mattx, yeah but not very active right now it seems
[21:10:50] <Mattx> hmn, ok
[21:10:59] <Mattx> I don't think if it's even possible to do
[21:11:29] <Mattx> err, I meant I don't think it's possible to do **
[21:12:15] <SteveBenner09> what is your tech stack
[21:12:18] <SteveBenner09> ruby or js? or...
[21:12:43] <Mattx> mine? just js
[21:14:59] <SteveBenner09> have you seen the 'mini-templating' lib from john resig?
[21:15:05] <Mattx> nop
[21:15:05] <SteveBenner09> er, 'micro-templating'
[21:15:10] <Mattx> let me check
[21:15:16] <SteveBenner09> check dat shiz
[21:15:39] <SteveBenner09> it's a good boilerplate for extending any templating enigne into a specific tool for solving 'impossible' problems yo
[21:16:26] <Mattx> (I'm not using node, just in case)
[21:16:35] <Onionnion> and here I am being unable to remove a button >.>
[21:19:44] <joobie> Guys, I have something like <div><div class="category"><p class="moo"></p></div><div class="category"><p class="moo"></p></div><div class="category><a></a></div></div> .. how can I use selectors so that when the <a> is clicked, it removes the last p.moo ?
[21:33:02] <beancurd> Onionnion: $(this).parent() gets the <p> tag.
[21:33:40] <Onionnion> beancurd, t'was the point, to delete the whole <p>, but I figured out, just had to put the .click() on the button.remove
[21:34:35] <beancurd> ah fair enough thought you were trying to get the div.
[21:35:12] <Onionnion> nah, the <p> that was created for each new button
[21:35:57] <beancurd> coolio.
[21:36:06] <sahbeewah> Mattx, you can't do exactly what you want there, but you should be able to find a workaround for what you want to do. Why don't you create the div element first and then append the span?
[21:36:18] <danux> guys i have an ajax route caleld /submit-images  which yields http 404 , but with firefox's HTTPRequest post /submit-images yields http 200 , why is this weird thing happening ?  i am using firefox
[21:37:26] <sahbeewah> danux, needs more context. give a url / fiddle
[21:38:21] <danux> sahbeewah, difficult to do with fiddle ,  can ajax header cause http 404 ?
[21:39:41] <sahbeewah> uh, if the server was specifically designed to block ajax requests then yeah
[21:39:50] <sahbeewah> but that seems unlikely
[21:40:18] <danux> sahbeewah,  this same ajax route works in another controller , that is the weird thing here
[21:42:09] <danux> i use Laravel for my app , could this be a laravel issue ?
[21:44:35] <sahbeewah> never used it. if you can verify that you are querying the same url for both requests, then yes it would be a server side issue
[21:45:59] <danux> sahbeewah, thanks for ur help
[21:46:46] <ussher_> simplemodal plugin for jquery and bootstraps native modal conflict.  They both want the name ".modal".  Is there any way I can un-define a function on a page via a script? ie. when I want to use simplemodal, turn bootstraps ".modal" off.
[21:55:40] <the8thbit> Is there a jquery plguin which assists in the creation of a simple grid view? All of my elements are squares of the same size which need margins of the same size all the way around. Basically, a table of squares. I just don't want to have to bother with creating and populatinng the table itself, as the number of elements will be variable, as will the size of the viewing area.
[22:00:51] <jphase> the8thbit: hmm, if each item could have a variable width/height I'd suggest using isotope/masonry, but it sounds like you want them to all be the same width and height.
[22:01:50] <the8thbit> jphase: Right, exactly. The only non-trivial aspect is that the viewer will have a variable width/height, so the number of rows/cols will be variable
[22:02:12] <jphase> the8thbit: well that part could be solved with some simple css
[22:02:33] <the8thbit> jphase: How so?
[22:04:08] <jphase> you could pretty easily loop through all the elements in your grid view and equalize their width and height based on the largest width/height of the set. Then to get them to fit based on your screen width you could use flexbox or masonry/isotope
[22:07:00] <joobie> Guys, I have something like <div><div class="category"><p class="moo"></p></div><div class="category"><p class="moo"></p></div><div class="category><a></a></div></div> .. how can I use selectors so that when the <a> is clicked, it removes the last p.moo ?
[22:09:45] <jphase> joobie: you should change that <a> to be valid firstly and add a class like removemoo or something, but it'd be something like $('a.removemoo').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $(this).parent().prev().children('.moo:last').remove(); });
[22:14:31] <the8thbit> jphase: Ah, I see what you're saying, if I _used_ flexbox/masonry/isotope, this would be simple css
[22:14:42] <the8thbit> which is most lightweight of the three?
[22:14:56] <the8thbit> also, least invasive
[22:14:58] <jphase> well, if you used flexbox (it's just css anyhow) then you can use jQuery to equalize the height and width
[22:15:18] <jphase> masonry and isotope are jQuery plugins that will fit content to the screen in a fancypants animated fashion
[22:15:34] <the8thbit> yeah flexbox *sounds* like something minimalist
[22:15:44] <the8thbit> and those two *sound* fancypants
[22:16:00] <the8thbit> its funny how names of things can do that
[22:16:06] <the8thbit> anyway, flexbox it is
[22:16:22] <jphase> but yeah, if you need to equalize width and height that can be pretty easy... I just wrote a blog post on this yesterday actually
[22:16:26] <jphase> here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/HQTnr/
[22:16:57] <jphase> just finds the widest element, sets the width of all those elements to that width. and likewise with the tallest
[22:17:00] <joobie> thanks jphase
[22:17:14] <jphase> np
[22:17:29] <the8thbit> sweet
[22:17:32] <the8thbit> thanks jphase

[22:20:50] <jphase> in case you want the original post for some reason: http://robido.com/blog/jquery/jquery-equalize-height-or-width-of-elements-make-same-uniform-height-or-width/
[22:21:31] <jphase> but yeah, to integrate flexbox I usually go off of Chris Coyier's post (he's kinda the tits)  http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
[22:46:40] <danux> when i do formData.append('file',file); , i get TypeError: 'append' called on an object that does not implement interface FormData. on  jquery.min.js line no 5
[22:46:47] <danux> how to fix this or bypass it ?
[22:48:29] <danux> anyone else had this issue before ?
[22:59:15] <jphase> danux: have a code sample?
[23:02:02] <danux> http://pastebin.com/fFPwq1Vn
[23:02:51] <jphase> I don't see where the append is
[23:07:21] <danux> jphase, sorry that was wrong link , here it is http://pastebin.com/H4Hw7TAA
[23:10:55] <jphase> danux: what are you trying to append/send exactly?
[23:11:39] <danux> jphase,  an image
[23:15:46] <danux> jphase,  prophet Google is helpless on this case :(
[23:15:52] <jphase> hehe
[23:16:25] <danux> jphase,  this is what Google gives - http://www.codeproject.com/Questions/677212/TypeError-append-called-on-an-object-that-does-not   - only problems , not answers :(
[23:16:35] <jphase> well I don't normally do this personally, nor work with FormData objects too much, but you should be able to send the entire form through ajax
[23:16:53] <jphase> yeah, obviously the append is the issue
[23:16:59] <jphase> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Using_FormData_Objects
[23:17:07] <jphase> that provides more info than anything else I've seen
[23:18:07] <danux> since this is an Image upload , i don't want to send the entire form via ajax
[23:19:45] <jphase> you should be able to append the file with .files[0]
[23:20:23] <danux> jphase, how ?
[23:21:27] <jphase> var formData = new FormData();  formData.append('file', $('#yourfileinput').files[0]);
[23:22:53] <danux> jphase,  hvnt i done that inthe code ?   $('#file') and input = $(this).val() , does the same thing isnt ?
[23:23:41] <danux> jph
[23:24:01] <danux> jphase,  line 4,5 of my code does it , does'nt it ?
[23:24:36] <jphase> well that definitely grabs the value of the whatever you're changing, sure
[23:24:59] <jphase> look at this example: http://new-bamboo.co.uk/blog/2012/01/10/ridiculously-simple-ajax-uploads-with-formdata
[23:25:09] <jphase> "Submitting only the file"
[23:25:17] <jphase> granted, this is old school js
[23:26:11] <jphase> I think the value is the same :\ can't remember
[23:26:37] <danux> it does the same thing as my script does :/
[23:27:30] <jphase> and you can console log formData before you submit and it looks good?
[23:27:42] <jphase> right, you get an append error
[23:29:42] <danux> consol.log(formData) gets green which means object is file , so this is an append error ,   if so , what about creating new array  ?
[23:29:46] <jphase> I have no idea, there shouldn't be any reason for it to throw an error from what I can tell
[23:30:26] <danux> exactly  i have the same thought
[23:31:17] <jphase> well the error sort of says that you can't append because it's not implementing the FormData interface
[23:32:45] <danux> but object which append itself is a formData object
[23:32:47] <danux> :/
[23:33:04] <danux> how can it say that it does not implement FormData interface ?
[23:35:01] <jphase> hmm
[23:35:06] <jphase> use the example on MDN
[23:35:13] <jphase> and tailor it to your elements
[23:37:01] <danux> i tried data:{'file':file}, , this does not issue an append errors but submits the whole form :/
[23:37:49] <jphase> use MDN's example at the bottom with $.ajax exactly how they're using it
[23:38:03] <jphase> then change to fit your elements and get it to work first
[23:38:39] <jphase> there's gotta be something scope related that's throwing that error or something my brain can't get at 2:38am
[23:39:15] <danux> jphase,  turn off the PC and goto bed
[23:41:15] <jphase> gotta compile the latest git from src first and finish part of this blog entry, I'm at the point of no return heh
