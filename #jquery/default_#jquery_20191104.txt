[11:18:21] <quinten> I have a page that I am trying to parse.
[11:19:24] <quinten> Sorry, didn't mean to put in carriage return! looking for a div of class "form_section", I want to select the next table of class "tablelistview". I'm new to jquery/selectors. This seems right but it's not returning a list of selected items: jQuery(".form_section + .tablelistview")
[11:21:12] <quinten> I also need to get the text value contained inside the div of class form_section
[12:45:32] <{pll}> hey guys, wondering if someone can point me in right direction.   Using jQuery autocomplete, but if end user types in a complete match, it doesn't select it automatically, unless they actually click on the item from the drop down list below the input.  Is there a way to autocomplete it if there's an exact match from the list?
[12:50:09] <robertmaxrees> which jquery autocomplete widget are you using?
[12:52:23] <{pll}> I believe just the built in one
[12:52:40] <{pll}> Set it up months ago but I don't see any external script resources other than the jQuery library
[12:54:12] <robertmaxrees> jquery itself doesn't come with any widgets.
[12:54:18] <robertmaxrees> do you mean jquery ui?
[12:55:05] <{pll}> yes sir, exactly what it is
[12:55:17] <{pll}> v1.12.1
[12:58:07] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-autoFocus
[13:05:06] <{pll}> hmm autofocus doesn't seem to auto select, just focus
[13:12:19] <{pll}> hey Robert, when I use autofocus I can see it focusing on an item in the list, and if I hit tab it selects it.   But if I click away from the input area it doesn't.  Essentially on lost focus, if the item typed matches something from the source, I want it selected
[13:12:40] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to hand-roll that functionality then.
[13:12:51] <robertmaxrees> at least that'd be my guess.
[13:31:25] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/OHTU4 having issues setting a cookie
[13:31:31] <primitivMedia> trying to set it 6 hours from the current time
[13:31:37] <primitivMedia> but it seems to not be added properly
[13:31:51] <robertmaxrees> wrong channel primitivMedia?
[13:32:16] <primitivMedia> oops sorry
[13:32:20] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:14:25] <NDT> Anyone here ever use jquery ui datepicker in a text field in a post metabox in wordpress? Because it seems to refuse dateFormat: for me.
[17:59:03] <primitivMedia> Uncaught TypeError: $.cookie is not a function
[17:59:08] <primitivMedia> i keep getting this all of a sudden
[17:59:51] <robertmaxrees> are you including a jquery cookie plugin?
[18:01:29] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia
[18:01:35] <primitivMedia> no im not
[18:01:40] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:01:42] <primitivMedia> but i didnt get this error before either
[18:01:42] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[18:01:47] <primitivMedia> which is whats throwing me off
[18:01:54] <robertmaxrees> were you getting other errors?
[18:01:59] <primitivMedia> nope nothing
[18:02:03] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[18:02:05] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it.
[18:02:26] <primitivMedia> is there an easier way to check if the cookie exist
[18:02:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:03:20] <primitivMedia> another way **
[18:03:29] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:03:34] <robertmaxrees> i think you just changed subject on me.
[18:03:40] <robertmaxrees> another way from what?
[18:03:53] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're asking in ##javascript now.
[18:03:57] <robertmaxrees> :) good luck!
[18:12:35] <primitivMedia> is there a cdn for the plugin
[18:12:41] <robertmaxrees> what plugin?
[18:12:51] <primitivMedia> .cookie
[18:13:11] <robertmaxrees> that could belong to multiple plugins.
[18:13:14] <robertmaxrees> so i dunno.
[18:13:22] <robertmaxrees> depends on which one you're using.
[18:13:31] <primitivMedia> i dont understand
[18:13:46] <robertmaxrees> your question asserts that there's a single jquery "cookie" plugin.
[18:13:52] <robertmaxrees> what that may or may not be the case.
[18:13:59] <robertmaxrees> multiple plugins could use that method name.
[18:15:48] <primitivMedia> https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery-cookie
[18:15:56] <primitivMedia> you knew exactly what I was talking about lol
[18:16:03] <robertmaxrees> actually i didn't.
[18:16:06] <robertmaxrees> but alrighty.
[18:16:10] <primitivMedia> should put 2 and 2 together
[18:16:16] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:16:17] <primitivMedia> we just had a convo on jquery cookie
[18:16:22] <robertmaxrees> no we didn't.
[18:16:34] <robertmaxrees> we had a conversation about why $.cookie is undefined.
[18:17:03] <primitivMedia> nvm
