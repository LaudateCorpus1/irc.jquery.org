[00:06:04] <Macaveli> is it possible for IE 11 to automatically reload JS when reloading a page?
[00:06:12] <Macaveli> He only reloads JS when i restart IE
[00:22:57] <Zost> hi guys, is there a plugin out there that would allow a funcionality similar to facebook like? So user can "like" something and then also unlike it. This would also trigger an ajax request at the back end
[00:23:14] <And1> Hey folks. I have a little gallery script for my website, which is loaded in the body (probably each time when a link to a gallery is clicked). Is this problematic or is there a problem with the keydown event that it doesn't get unloaded when navigating away from this gallery or something like that? http://lpaste.net/105825
[00:29:29] <Macaveli> Hi Cork morning
[00:30:00] <Macaveli> Is it possible to pass extra params/vars to a submit class optional? Please check out this: http://jsfiddle.net/VWOU/9AFh6/1/
[00:30:15] <Macaveli> The "$(document.activeElement)" works fine in chrome etc but not in IE
[00:32:36] <And1> How about adding a click-event to that script, which triggers the keyoff. The click-event should happen, when some navigation link is clicked. Does that make sense?
[00:33:26] <Macaveli> Not at all :D
[00:35:09] <Macaveli> Or maybe i just don't understand :p
[00:39:32] <And1> Macaveli: Lines 52–54 http://lpaste.net/105825
[00:41:02] <Cork> Macaveli: you can pass parameters to .submit()
[00:43:12] <Cork> Macaveli: http://jsfiddle.net/9AFh6/3/
[00:43:39] <Macaveli> Cork, and And1 Personal Hero for this day ! <3
[00:44:12] <Cork> opps typo in the trigger call
[00:44:38] <Cork> Macaveli: though that said, you should prob avoid doing this
[00:44:52] <Cork> Macaveli: your breaking accessibility
[00:44:58] <Cork> *you're
[00:45:03] <And1> There's an ä too much, isn't it? http://jsfiddle.net/9AFh6/4/
[00:45:10] <Cork> :)
[00:45:12] <Cork> ya
[00:45:25] <Cork> damn
[00:45:31] <And1> Cork do you have a hint for me, too? : )
[00:45:31] <Cork> and i missed the [] around the val()
[00:45:59] <Macaveli> Cork, well in IE I can't do it because $(document.activeElement) -> H2 class
[00:46:03] <Macaveli> or something
[00:46:06] <Macaveli> works fine in chrome
[00:46:24] <Cork> Macaveli: ya, activeElement isn't a good action
[00:46:39] <Macaveli> so this is a better alternative ?
[00:47:04] <Cork> Macaveli: normally the best option is to not have the button control the action of the form
[00:47:17] <Macaveli> Well here it should :/
[00:47:30] <Cork> and instead have something like a checkbox or a radio group
[00:47:55] <Cork> Macaveli: yes, you CAN do it, but you will have to fiddle around to not break the form behaviors
[00:48:05] <Cork> and you will always get broken behavior for enter
[00:59:36] <Macaveli> Facebook Down?
[00:59:47] <kraftman> yup
[00:59:58] <Macaveli> no I should start cutting my wrists now
[01:00:03] <Macaveli> noooo
[01:00:06] <Macaveli> no more facebook
[01:00:13] <Macaveli> just kid din ' :D
[01:06:10] <zitter> hi, is it possible to load json data from indexeddb and if not present, load it from external server?
[01:08:11] <Cork> zitter: sure check for the data in the db
[01:08:17] <Cork> and if it isn't there make an ajax call
[01:10:22] <zitter> how? $.json("ajax/test.json", function(data){ /* code here */ }); to load json from external script. But how to check if it exists, first?
[01:13:04] <zitter> I mean: if json data exists in indexedDb? I'm using ydn plugin so I can check with db.get("db", "table", "key"); but I don't know how to combine these two statements
[01:17:30] <Cork> zitter: well you would have to make the db request
[01:17:33] <Cork> if the data doesn't exist
[01:17:39] <Cork> you make the ajax request
[01:18:32] <zitter> yep, but I don't know how to combine these two statements. Code live inside $.json() function....
[01:18:47] <Macaveli> Cork, wanna check out my master code?
[01:19:09] <Macaveli> paste bin / paste / jsfiddle / gist ? Which is preferred in #jquery?
[01:19:11] <Cork> zitter: no the code lives inside the inline function you pass to what ever function you use to make the json request (there is no $.json)
[01:19:18] <Macaveli> for just code
[01:19:27] <Cork> zitter: just move that function to a named function and call it in both cases
[01:19:55] <Cork> Macaveli: jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com
[01:19:58] <zitter> ok thanks Cork
[01:20:28] <ufk_> hello
[01:20:43] <Macaveli> Cork, check it out -> the master apply.js http://jsfiddle.net/VWOU/4duBF/
[01:20:58] <Macaveli> Any suggestions are welcome :D
[01:21:03] <Cork> Macaveli: ugg.. use some variables...
[01:21:14] <Macaveli> for what?
[01:21:20] <ufk_> i want to use the .draggable() functionality but i want the item to be cloned, which means not to be removed from the original list of items. i have helper: 'clone' but it seems that it doesn't work. the item is removed from the list of draggable items
[01:21:23] <Cork> instead of the constant dom queries
[01:21:34] <Cork> you basically have one dom query on every line of that script
[01:24:04] <Macaveli> But the rest seems fine? :p
[01:24:47] <Cork> Macaveli: it is bad in quite many ways
[01:24:55] <Macaveli> :(
[01:24:59] <Cork> like ex removeAttr('style', 'background:#dddddd;') ??
[01:25:16] <Cork> that line doens't even make sense
[01:25:24] <Macaveli> Yes it does
[01:25:32] <Cork> no
[01:25:35] <Macaveli> email has a "disabled" look to it
[01:25:46] <Macaveli> so it has background:#dddddd
[01:25:54] <Macaveli> when error occurs it should be back editable
[01:26:01] <Cork> but background:#dddddd; isn't an attribute...
[01:26:07] <Cork> its a css value...
[01:26:25] <Macaveli> than why does it work?
[01:26:30] <Cork> and removeAttr doens't take a second argument
[01:26:50] <Cork> Macaveli: removeAttr('style', 'background:#dddddd;') is the EXACT same thing as removeAttr('style')
[01:27:00] <Cork> so you basically remove the style attribute from the element
[01:27:06] <Cork> no matter what is in it
[01:27:07] <Macaveli> aah okie :D
[01:27:26] <Macaveli> That works :p
[01:27:28] <Macaveli> changed it
[01:27:28] <Cork> what you most likely want is .css('background', '')
[01:27:38] <Cork> or even better use a class
[01:28:13] <Cork> next problem removeAttr 'disabled'
[01:28:21] <Cork> don't ever use attr for disabled
[01:28:30] <Cork> use prop('disabled', true/false)
[01:28:56] <Cork> again attr('style', 'background:#dddddd;')
[01:29:13] <Cork> your code is very fradgile
[01:29:22] <Cork> *fragile
[01:30:17] <Cork> at line 46 to 54 you have a long list of .closest("fieldset").show()
[01:30:21] <Cork> these can all be combined
[01:31:32] <Macaveli> Cork, how to combine?
[01:31:38] <Amnesia> question prev() should be able to traverse multiple tags right? I've got the following markup: https://privatepaste.com/aaa8376b13 and I'm trying to select #stat_icon from #total's point of view, but unfortunately $('#total').prev('span') or $('#total'.prev('#span_icon') doesn't match anything
[01:31:45] <Amnesia> what am I missing out here?
[01:32:42] <Cork> Macaveli: $("h2.sources, h2.education, h2.experiences, h2.qualifications, h2.surveys, h2.motivation, h2.attachments, h2.apply_buttons, .button_list").closest("fieldset").show()
[01:32:55] <Macaveli> aah awesome :p
[01:32:57] <Cork> Macaveli: though you should prob give all those elements a common class and use that instead
[01:33:02] <jemendja> hello
[01:33:15] <krambiorix> hi, when loading a page i want to load some autocompletes (ajax)   ... How can i do that in background so the user can work ?
[01:33:38] <Cork> Macaveli: this is just scratching the surface of the problems here honestly
[01:34:03] <Cork> Amnesia: no it isn't
[01:34:24] <Cork> Amnesia: .prev() checks exactly the previous element in the siblings list
[01:34:43] <Cork> Amnesia: if you give it a selector and that one doesn't match that element, you get nothing
[01:34:46] <Amnesia> I tried closest() asell btw
[01:34:51] <Cork> Amnesia: no
[01:34:56] <Amnesia> aswell*
[01:34:56] <Cork> .closest() is for checking parents
[01:35:01] <Cork> not siblings
[01:35:13] <Cork> Amnesia: you want .prevAll('selector').first()
[01:35:48] <drager> If I load for instance posts via ajax and appends it to the body I cant do any other js plugins on it. How can I fix it?
[01:36:05] <Amnesia> Cork: I tried prevAll() aswell, it doesn't return anything
[01:36:19] <Cork> Amnesia: then the elements your looking for isn't siblings
[01:36:30] <Cork> Amnesia: the dom is a tree
[01:36:37] <Cork> your not working with html
[01:36:49] <Amnesia> the dom's generated based on the html right?
[01:37:05] <Cork> Amnesia: sure, but it isn't the same structure
[01:37:15] <Amnesia> ah that explains
[01:37:25] <Cork> html is just a long list of tags
[01:37:33] <Cork> dom is parent nodes with child nodes
[01:37:44] <Cork> (not start/end tags)
[01:37:51] <Amnesia> I see
[01:38:10] <Amnesia> guess I'll have to select the <tr> then and look for #span_icon in that then:)
[01:38:11] <krambiorix> any idea?
[01:38:15] <Cork> krambiorix: request the data as the user types in something that should autocomplete
[01:38:35] <Cork> Amnesia: what is the structure you're trying to navigate?
[01:38:43] <Amnesia> Cork: https://privatepaste.com/aaa8376b13
[01:39:02] <Cork> drager: you have to run the plugins on the new elements as/before you add them to the page
[01:39:13] <Cork> drager: plugins can't modify something that doens't exist :)
[01:39:16] <krambiorix> Cork, it takes too long
[01:39:27] <krambiorix> Cork, that way, the user has to wait ...
[01:39:33] <Cork> Amnesia: and you want what from where?
[01:39:45] <krambiorix> Cork, i want them to load on page load but in the background... Is thatpossible?
[01:39:50] <Amnesia> Cork: I want #stat_icon from #total
[01:40:21] <Cork> Amnesia: $('#stat_icon'
[01:40:26] <Cork> Amnesia: * $('#stat_icon')
[01:40:35] <Cork> you have an id it is globally unique
[01:40:37] <Cork> just select it
[01:40:49] <Cork> there can ever only exist on element on the page with that id
[01:40:51] <Amnesia> well, the paste's just a mockup
[01:41:05] <Amnesia> there're multiple elements with those ids
[01:41:12] <Amnesia> in the actual page*
[01:41:13] <Cork> Amnesia: then you have invalid html
[01:41:18] <Amnesia> oh dear:P
[01:41:23] <Cork> and those ids is useless
[01:41:50] <Cork> you could do something like $('input').click(function() { $(this).closest('tr').find('span') })
[01:41:57] <Cork> but the ids isn't usable
[01:42:12] <Cork> Amnesia: if you want multiple elements with the same reference
[01:42:15] <Cork> you use classes
[01:42:16] <Cork> not ids
[01:42:23] <Amnesia> okay
[01:42:26] <Amnesia> ty for the tip
[01:42:41] <Cork> you could do something like $('.total').click(function() { $(this).closest('tr').find('.stat_icon') })
[01:42:45] <Amnesia> and yep, I already suspected I had to select the closest tr first
[01:43:08] <Amnesia> guess I'm going to check out how to visualize the dom tree:)
[01:43:13] <Cork> Amnesia: and while you're at it run the page through w3c validate
[01:43:15] <Amnesia> cause I thought it was a 1:1 mapping to the html
[01:43:23] <Cork> ?g w3c validate
[01:43:24] <b-ot> Cork: The W3C Markup Validation Service → http://validator.w3.org/
[01:43:25] <Amnesia> will do!
[01:43:49] <Macaveli> Cork the prop('disabled', true/false) is not working out for me and $('#cancel_button').attr 'disabled', 'disabled'  it's for a link styled as as button
[01:44:04] <Macaveli> $('#cancel_button').attr 'disabled', 'disabled'  is working *
[01:44:07] <Cork> Macaveli: then your adding invalid attributes...
[01:44:19] <Cork> disabled isn't a valid attriubte for links
[01:44:36] <Amnesia> Cork: thanks for your time
[01:44:39] <Cork> your best option is to move it to .data('disabled', true)
[01:44:45] <Cork> Amnesia: np
[01:47:20] <jemendja> .
[01:49:04] <drager> Cork: Hm
[01:49:36] <beasty> morning all!
[01:52:03] <drager> Cork: Yeah, it works on the already loaded (first 5)
[01:52:27] <Cork> drager: what is the "plugins"?
[01:53:14] <drager> Cork: https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll and https://github.com/noelboss/featherlight
[01:53:55] <Cork> drager: ah, haven't used the later one (and only read the first one)
[01:54:26] <Cork> drager: you would have to see if you can get featherlight to either bind to a parent and dynamically handle children
[01:54:33] <Cork> tell it to "refresh"
[01:54:38] <Cork> or how to add the new elements to it
[01:58:25] <drager> Cork: I see, this is how I do; http://jsfiddle.net/fBB2c/
[01:58:30] <drager> to load it
[01:59:26] <Cork> drager: try running line 19 on newElements inbetween line 14 and 15
[02:00:51] <sqlnoob> I'm trying to use modal window in bootstrap but whenever I open my modal window, the modal-backdrop shadow does not disappear and my actual modal window remains behind it
[02:03:22] <drager> Cork: Yeah, that works for the new ones
[02:05:04] <drager> Cork: This works fine; http://jsfiddle.net/fBB2c/1/ except an typeError on line 25
[02:05:20] <drager> (TypeError: $(...).masonry is not a function)
[02:05:46] <Cork> drager: $($newElems).featherlightGallery => $newElems.featherlightGallery
[02:06:13] <Cork> might be that masonry expects html and not dom objects
[02:06:25] <Cork> and then your kinda in a though spot...
[02:06:40] <drager> Well, it works but yeah
[02:06:49] <diverdude> anybody in here using qunit? Is it a good unit testing library? cons, pros?
[02:09:04] <drager> Cork: I do not need that masonry so I removed it
[02:51:10] <diverdude> anybody in here using qunit? Is it a good unit testing library? cons, pros?
[03:03:56] <m4strmind> diverdude, its pretty good
[03:04:25] <m4strmind> i dont know that its better than any other unit testing out there but it met my needs for some client side tests
[03:05:25] <m4strmind> and it was pretty simple to use
[03:08:59] <Dawie4343> Hello, I'm trying to make my table editable by the use of some jquery. I am currently generating the table through a call from  my database. Using jQuery to format the table. I'm unsure where my code for making the table editable is going wrong, if anyone would care to take a look at my code I would very much appreciate that. http://jsbin.com/goluduka/1/edit
[03:23:32] <bee_keeper> hi, am trying to learn a bit more about debugging using firefox debug console.  can i know which code is fired on a button click using some kind of breakpoint?
[03:24:29] <Cork> bee_keeper: you can put a breakpoint in the handler function
[03:24:46] <Cork> but other then that; don't think so
[03:25:45] <bee_keeper> Cork: ok, then i'd have to know where the handler was.  just thought there might be a quicker way
[03:46:16] <bee_keeper> what's the best way to detect that a div has been added inside a parent container?  Can i do this without plugins?
[03:56:36] <Cork> bee_keeper: there is really only one way to do that
[03:56:49] <Cork> bee_keeper: and that is through the MutationObserver
[03:57:03] <Cork> bee_keeper: though if you need ie support your kinda out of luck
[03:57:08] <Cork> (only exist in ie11)
[03:57:31] <Cork> bee_keeper: if you need older ie support you need to have the code adding the element notify you instead
[03:57:46] <Cork> (plugins is a BAD solution for this as those are based on setInterval)
[04:23:38] <DRSK> I find myself using self = this from time to time and it feels.. yeah well, what alternatives are there? .call perhaps?
[04:24:40] <DRSK> proxy?
[04:27:35] <Cork> DRSK: proxy is a very slow way to do the same thing
[04:27:50] <Cork> DRSK: if you don't need older ie support you can use .bind on the function
[04:29:51] <DRSK> Cork » well say I have 2 functions such as functionName: function(a,b) { ... } and then function2 : function() { if( functionName(someVal, someOtherVal) ) do stuff; }
[04:30:05] <DRSK> now I'd do var self = this; and then self.functionName()
[04:30:27] <DRSK> within the second function, to access it. How do you, in this example, mean I could make use of .bind if I neglect older IE support?
[04:31:17] <Cork> DRSK: not sure what you mean with that example
[04:31:32] <Cork> doesn't look like you have any scope there
[04:31:58] <DRSK> It's within a $.extend(Whatnot.prototype, { functionName: function(a,b) {} etc
[04:32:31] <Cork> DRSK: sure, but you still arn't using any scope inhariting
[04:32:38] <Cork> *inheriting
[04:33:50] <Cork> var self = this; is only useful if you do something like function1(a,b) { var self = this; func(function() { self.<something> }); }
[04:34:35] <DRSK> right
[04:34:41] <felixjet> when i change a radio button
[04:34:54] <felixjet> should work $('input[name=type]').on('change', function(e) { ?
[04:34:55] <Cork> DRSK: es6 will solve those problems though
[04:34:57] <felixjet> because is not working :/
[04:35:18] <Cork> felixjet: make a jsfiddle.net
[04:35:31] <felixjet> im just asking if it should work
[04:35:31] <Cork> DRSK: there you have fat arrows and those arn't creating scopes
[04:35:40] <felixjet> the change event on a radio button
[04:35:48] <Cork> felixjet: ok and that answer is "possibly"
[04:35:55] <Cork> depending on what you run it on
[04:36:05] <felixjet> what does that mean?
[04:36:14] <Cork> meaning too little info to answer
[04:36:24] <felixjet> just a radio button with 2 options
[04:36:32] <felixjet> $('input[name=type]').on('change', function(e) { console.log('foo'); });
[04:36:33] <felixjet> doesn't works
[04:36:34] <Cork> felixjet: make a fiddle
[04:36:36] <felixjet> should it?
[04:36:46] <felixjet> why? im not asking "why my code doesn't work"
[04:36:57] <felixjet> im asking if the "change" event should work in radio buttons
[04:37:07] <felixjet> or i should use click or something
[04:37:33] <Cork> felixjet: if you want someone to help with the problem show them the problem
[04:37:42] <felixjet> there is no problem
[04:37:46] <Cork> ok
[04:37:47] <felixjet> im making a question
[04:37:58] <DRSK> Cork » ok just to summarize, http://jsfiddle.net/Ew5JP/11/ <-- i you perhaps check line 114 and line 128
[04:37:58] <felixjet> if "change" events works on radio buttons
[04:38:00] <felixjet> easy as that
[04:38:29] <DRSK> input[type="radio"] on change should work afaik.
[04:39:12] <Cork> DRSK: bind would break that code
[04:39:25] <DRSK> ah as suspected, so technically that's the way to do it?
[04:39:27] <Cork> as it would make $(this) inside return the wrong variable
[04:39:31] <saucey> hey guys im look for a infinate scroller that works responsive
[04:40:05] <DRSK> var that = this; might be more.. logical in terms of terminology though? oh well, I was just.. wondering if self = this was bad and there in fact was a smarter way
[04:40:07] <Cork> DRSK: it is one way to do it yes
[04:40:18] <Cork> DRSK: i HATE that
[04:40:26] <DRSK> care to show me another? just for.. well, just because?
[04:40:33] <DRSK> what is it you hate?
[04:40:41] <Cork> "that" is a completely meaningless variable
[04:40:52] <Cork> self might be meaningful if it actually is "self"
[04:41:00] <Cork> just give the variable a meaningful name
[04:41:18] <DRSK> right, understood Cork thank you :)
[04:42:44] <bee_keeper> I want to call a function when an element with a certain id is inserted on the page by some jquery i do not control.  What's the best way to do this?
[04:43:29] <Cork> bee_keeper: i've already answer that question
[04:44:08] <Cork> bee_keeper: if you are ok with only supporting ie11+ (and the other fairly modern browsers) you can use MutationObserver
[04:44:24] <Cork> bee_keeper: if limiting to very modern browsers isn't ok
[04:44:25] <Cork> you can't
[04:44:39] <Cork> the one adding the element needs to notify you instead
[04:44:46] <bee_keeper> Cork: apologies, must have missed it.  Going back up to read it
[04:45:46] <gurke_> hello@all :)
[04:57:50] <bee_keeper> Cork: hmm, i used 'on' in a roundabout way and it appeared to work, what is this mutationObserver, it's not a jquery thing right?
[04:58:12] <Cork> ?g mdn mutationobserver
[04:58:13] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[04:58:39] <Cork> bee_keeper: but ya, if you want to have an event listener for an element that might exist in the future
[04:58:48] <Cork> you can do that without a mutation observer
[04:59:17] <gingitsune> Hey, how would one go about selecting the last text node in a p and changing its value
[04:59:56] <gingitsune> <p><span>Email:</span> name@email.com</p>
[05:00:20] <gingitsune> I'd like to change the email section
[05:09:14] <KevinCollmer> hi guys.
[05:10:12] <KevinCollmer> I've got a problem. Im using jQuery.load and it loads a HTML page with pictures. After it has loaded their is a function which jQuery.load divs of that loaded thing.
[05:10:27] <KevinCollmer> Problem is that pictures are missing untill ALL jQuery.loads are done
[05:11:09] <KevinCollmer> Its hard to complain... I would pref to show you
[05:11:30] <KevinCollmer> So if someone got a few minutes it would be very great
[05:17:21] <MikeD_> why don't you just post the url?
[05:17:43] <KevinCollmer> http://crackware.eu/en/summoner/EUW/26263135#history
[05:18:14] <KevinCollmer> as you see, names got loaded before the pictures are loaded
[05:22:22] <MikeD_> 223 requests ?  have you considered maybe using a different url for multiple concurrent downloads?
[05:22:46] <MikeD_> ex: avatars.crackware.eu, sitegraphics.crackware.eu, etc.
[05:23:15] <MikeD_> that way you don't have blocking on the site elements while your 4 (or 6 or whatever) threads are waiting for download?
[05:24:05] <MikeD_> also, are you using sprites for the elements?
[05:24:40] <KevinCollmer> so a subdomain for images, for my loads will work better
[05:24:42] <MikeD_> ex: if you have 20 small squares of content you really want to only download one image and show a piece of it rather than 20 separate downloads
[05:24:47] <KevinCollmer> then doing multiple loads on the same domain?
[05:25:38] <BulleTime> guys, anyone knows the jquery masonry (packery) plugin?
[05:26:13] <MikeD_> KevinCollmer: see this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/985431/max-parallel-http-connections-in-a-browser
[05:26:29] <hxm> hi, I have this function http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=fsVWx21y and I use it like this: var response = ajaxPage(pagename); alert(response.result); the ajax works and does its part, but the alert never comes
[05:26:53] <MikeD_> "maximum connections per host name"  <-- it's the per _host name_ part that you'd be exploiting for your workaround
[05:27:44] <MikeD_> of course you probably have a lot of other things you can do too - like group together one call for multiple pieces of data instead of 200+ posts
[05:30:15] <MikeD_> KevinCollmer: do you use firebug to see what's going on?
[05:40:01] <richurs> hello, i am trying to remove a specific content from a div, here is the fiddle i tried, but is not removing ? http://jsfiddle.net/KKGBD/
[05:40:59] <Cork> richurs: http://jsfiddle.net/KKGBD/1/
[05:41:51] <richurs> hmm what was i doing wrong
[05:42:40] <richurs> thanks anyways
[05:50:26] <saucey> hey guys
[05:50:37] <saucey> im look for a infinate scroller that works responsive
[05:52:24] <AL13N_work> how do i remove the last X entries?
[05:52:45] <AL13N_work> in a jquery object
[05:53:44] <AL13N_work> ah slice
[06:00:35] <zafu> hi, can I dynamically highlight an html anchor with jq? ( http://url/page#anchor )
[06:02:34] <chinoto> zafu: Eh, yes, are you asking about something special?
[06:03:05] <zafu> never mind I found a solution with css
[06:03:12] <chinoto> k
[06:03:14] <zafu> :target pseudo class
[06:11:17] <chinoto> zafu: For javascript, if there isn't something specifically for it, you could do /#.*/.exec(location.href)
[06:11:39] <zafu> $(':target').parent().effect('pulsate', {times: 3}, 1000);
[06:12:21] <chinoto> Looks valid
[06:12:46] <zafu> this draw attention to the target :)
[06:12:51] <zafu> draws
[06:14:51] <BillCriswell> Ugh, this kiosk software is going to be the death of me.
[06:25:04] <ciqsteve> can someone confirm this-
[06:25:14] <ciqsteve> if I detach an element from the dom, does it in some way
[06:25:32] <ciqsteve> 'invalidate' the nextAll()
[06:25:34] <ciqsteve> command?
[06:26:01] <ciqsteve> for example- before detach() next all returns elements, after detach next all returns []
[06:26:04] <ciqsteve> ?
[06:26:32] <chinoto> ciqsteve: Wouldn't you expect that?
[06:27:00] <ciqsteve> no, because there are still plenty of elements left for next all to grab
[06:27:33] <chinoto> What elements? It has no parent and thus no siblings.
[06:27:44] <ciqsteve> never mind... user error   :)
[06:27:55] <chinoto> dev error :P
[06:28:04] <ciqsteve> yes very
[06:33:32] <d0de> hi everyone
[06:37:48] <outer> hi all
[06:38:56] <Fishy> If i dynamically add data-role="popup" elements.. How can i reload jquery mobile so that it applies the correct styles.
[06:48:07] <BillCriswell>  Someone come up with a good idea for me.
[06:48:36] <xec> The wheel.
[06:51:33] <NoiseEee> canned tuna with mayo already mixed in the can
[06:52:52] <saucey> 	im look for a infinate scroller that works responsive
[06:55:38] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: That sounds awesome.
[06:56:05] <BillCriswell> I bought some tuna last night for my first time in a while. Not sure why I haven't eaten it in a while.
[06:58:13] <chinoto> Dates and carrots run through a food processor, press it out into a pan, stick it in the fridge, slice it up: carrot bars.
[06:58:41] <chinoto> Might wanna put nuts or coconut in to dry it up.
[07:02:18] <BillCriswell> Every server I'm working on today is sloowwww
[07:52:59] <DesignerX> hi everyone
[08:00:46] <jtri> hello, i am having trouble extracting inner html from pre tag and escaping less than and greater than symbols: http://jsfiddle.net/BZeH2/2/
[08:00:55] <Blinky_> Hi all, could someone have a look at the code for changing pages and let me know if it is the best solution or is there a better way. http://pastebin.com/XMpW8e8s - I am not a huge fan of the # tag in the url but if it has to be there then so be it.  Any help/info would be great.
[08:01:18] <jtri> namely, the result array from the jquery select doesn't seem to have methods i am trying, like .content() , .text() , etc
[08:02:15] <Znow> Heya, I have this site with a page that shows a list of users for the Hall of Fame. A user can see its position by appending "?user=USERNAME" to the URL and the page will scrolldown and highlight the name and the position of the user. But if the "USERNAME" contains a "æ,ø,å", it wont scroll down to that user. http://jsfiddle.net/bdUt6/
[08:03:14] <jtri> i guess the jquery select creates a DOM element, and it doesn't have any methods on it?... confused
[08:03:46] <jtri> if i console.log( res[ii] ); there are no methods...
[08:05:55] <ciqsteve> Q:  I have a page with a 20 lists  UL li li li .. UL li li li ..
[08:06:23] <ciqsteve> within any li a user can click a button that requires me to select the last element in the list (last li)
[08:06:28] <ciqsteve> here is how I do that now:
[08:06:38] <ciqsteve> $(this).parent().parent().children().filter(":last")
[08:06:41] <drej> ciqsteve better to prepare a test case on jsfiddle
[08:06:45] <ciqsteve> is that crazy or reasonable?
[08:07:39] <ciqsteve> essentially I am moving up to the UL then filtering the li's for the last one
[08:07:58] <ciqsteve> my specific case aside, can jquery do this quickly or is it a gigantic pig?
[08:08:38] <NoiseEee> ciqsteve: it can do it quickly, you probably want to mention the element you're searching for ( see parents()) because the way you stand now, if you change the DOM at all your selector goes balls
[08:08:41] <MikeD_> instead of all children and filtering, can you just use the selector for last ?
[08:08:59] <NoiseEee> ciqsteve: meant http://api.jquery.com/closest/ instead of parents()
[08:09:35] <ciqsteve> NoiseEee - ahh good point thanks
[08:09:47] <MikeD_> .siblings(":last") ?
[08:10:08] <ciqsteve> MikeD_  so instead of going to the parent level, get to the sibling level.. that would work
[08:10:32] <ciqsteve> Noise- closest() will look thanks
[08:10:40] <MikeD_> though since siblings excludes self, you'd have a special case if they clicked on the last one directly :(
[08:11:19] <ciqsteve> side Q:  does JQuery cache previous used selectors - like if I call the parent child child child thing 3 times in row does it have the el cached or does it retraverse each time?
[08:11:34] <NoiseEee> ciqsteve: its up to you to cache it.
[08:11:39] <Blinky_> Hi all, could someone have a look at the code for changing pages and let me know if it is the best solution or is there a better way. http://pastebin.com/XMpW8e8s - I am not a huge fan of the # tag in the url but if it has to be there then so be it.  Any help/info would be great.
[08:11:47] <ciqsteve> NE- k
[08:12:34] <MikeD_> ciqsteve: var myfoo = $( {etc} );   <-- not cached, just stored reference
[08:13:00] <ciqsteve> MD_  y thanks
[08:13:12] <MikeD_> besides, who wants to copy/paste long chains of selectors?  it's not DRY :)
[08:14:33] <ciqsteve> :)  like this:
[08:14:42] <ciqsteve> parentEl = $(this).closest("ul, .className")
[08:14:50] <ciqsteve> ?
[08:15:13] <ciqsteve> or "ul.className"
[08:16:06] <jtri> ok, getting closer but still not quite working: http://jsfiddle.net/BZeH2/4/
[08:17:48] <ciqsteve> , vs . nvr mind
[08:26:26] <gh2> hi guys, any alternative to high stocks (http://www.highcharts.com/products/highstock)? any free or open source which can be used on commercial sites also?
[08:30:12] <SkyLeach> hey all
[08:30:58] <SkyLeach> does anyone know of a bug where $ gets re-defined as a function inside of a $.when async block?
[08:35:45] <anli_> I want to disable clicks on an easytab, returning false in click handler did not seem to do anything
[08:43:28] <gnarf> SkyLeach ?
[08:44:22] <gnarf> anli_: you might need event.stopImmediatePropagation()
[08:44:41] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[08:44:58] <gh2> hi guys, any alternative to high stocks (http://www.highcharts.com/products/highstock)? any free or open source which can be used on commercial sites also?
[08:46:19] <anli_> gnarf: ok, now I have tried that as well
[08:46:31] <Frazzz> wtf, i have an object like var transitionObject = function() {this.left = 0; this.top = 0; this.duration = 0; this.easing = 'linear'; } and when i instance it, easing isnt even in the object
[08:46:44] <Frazzz> if i change the name of the easing variable, then it works
[08:46:52] <gnarf> anli_: hard to say, add some breakpoints inside easytab (whatever that is) and see where you might be able to "hook" it?
[08:47:01] <Frazzz> or if i get rid of the other three properties, it works
[08:47:10] <anli_> Hm, uses minified version, must change then
[08:47:35] <duch_kazatel> var transitionObject = function() {
[08:47:35] <duch_kazatel> 	this.left = 0;
[08:47:36] <duch_kazatel> 	this.top = 0;
[08:47:36] <duch_kazatel> 	this.duration = 0;
[08:47:36] <duch_kazatel> 	this.easing = 'linear';
[08:47:36] <duch_kazatel> }
[08:47:40] <duch_kazatel> woops my bad.
[08:47:50] <gnarf> PASTE FAIL!!!!
[08:47:52] <gnarf> ;)
[08:48:12] <aivonix> Hi everyone ... I have a newb question ... because I am getting a "TypeError: undefined is not a function" on a project I am new to ... is there a way to debug such an error more easily, I do not understand where to look for the error. There is also AngularJS on top and error reports are not helpful
[08:49:08] <Frazzz> it works fine on js fiddle, theres no reason it shouldnt:(
[08:49:33] <Frazzz> but in my own project easing keeps disappearing, and in not setting it anywhere else in my code
[08:49:44] <Frazzz> in fact im logging it as soon as the object gets creayed
[08:49:47] <Frazzz> created*
[08:49:56] <gnarf> Frazzz: how do you "instance it" ?
[08:49:58] <duch_kazatel> Frazzz can you share your functioning example?
[08:50:14] <gnarf> new transitionObject() ?
[08:50:30] <Frazzz> the whole project is a speghettified 3000ish lines of code, so i dont really wanna paste that
[08:50:36] <Frazzz> gnarf, yes
[08:50:37] <anli_> gnarf: Also trying e.returnValue = false; without luck
[08:50:46] <gnarf> Frazzz: sure your "new" is in the right place?
[08:50:51] <gnarf> because i could see that having problems
[08:50:53] <gnarf> also
[08:51:09] <gnarf> why not just var obj = { left: 0, top: 0, duration: 0, easing: 'liner' }; ?
[08:51:53] <duch_kazatel> aivonix there should be a trace of some kind - can you find the line that error is ocurring on?
[08:52:34] <Frazzz> cos i need to instantiate it multiple times
[08:52:41] <Frazzz> gnarf http://pastebin.com/VarRWw4B
[08:53:01] <chinoto> Frazzz, gnarf: If you were to do it all in one shot, it would be like this: $.extend(this,{left: 0, top: 0, duration: 0, easing: 'liner'});
[08:53:04] <gnarf> var p = { left: 0, top: 0, duration: 0, easing: 'linear' };
[08:53:12] <gnarf> Frazzz: ^ just do that
[08:53:21] <gnarf> Frazzz unless you are defining prototype methods
[08:53:22] <gnarf> or something
[08:53:50] <Frazzz> but then whenever i set a property in that object, it will be global wont it?
[08:53:54] <gnarf> no
[08:54:21] <gnarf> function test() { return { unique: true }; };  test() === test(); // false
[08:55:03] <aivonix> duch_kazatel it is all connected to AngularJS errors
[08:55:03] <gnarf> Frazzz: basically whenever a line of code with an object literal is executed, a new object is created from that literal
[08:55:37] <duch_kazatel> aivonix that kind of error typically means you're calling a method on an object that isn't what you think it is, like trying to call .text() on a non-jquery object.
[08:55:47] <gh2> someone please help me... a noob here :'(
[08:55:53] <Frazzz> so just properties = p; creates a new instance of p?
[08:55:55] <gnarf> aivonix: so catch unhandled expections can be useful, but things ilke angular and ember make debug a little harder
[08:56:05] <Frazzz> or properties = new p?
[08:56:08] <gnarf> var p = {} creates a new p
[08:56:16] <duch_kazatel> Frazzz you don't need new in this case.
[08:56:28] <aivonix> Ok ... I will try harded then, thanks gnarf and duch_kazatel and debug is harder yeah
[08:56:46] <duch_kazatel> aivonix can you share the line you're getting that error on?
[08:56:58] <gnarf> or is the error inside angular
[08:57:08] <chinoto> >> 1
[08:57:20] <chinoto> Guess that's just ##javascript
[08:57:21] <duch_kazatel> aivonix if not, check out how you're getting to that line.  sometimes errors like that are because you're passing the wrong kind of object to a function.

[08:57:45] <chinoto> hm
[08:57:50] <Frazzz> well yes, but what about var transition1 = p; var transition2 = p; then arnt transition 1 and 2 just assigned the p object and if i change a property in either, it will change in both?
[08:57:57] <duch_kazatel> js> print($)
[08:58:08] <gnarf> Frazzz: yes, but you aren't doing that
[08:58:12] <Frazzz> yes i am
[08:58:16] <gnarf> var transition1 = {}; var transition2 = {};
[08:58:25] <gnarf> add_keyframe only has one p
[08:58:28] <gnarf> one transition
[08:58:36] <gnarf> each time it gets called its a different "p"
[08:58:42] <duch_kazatel> welcome to js scoping.
[08:58:52] <gnarf> welcome to any language scoping
[08:59:11] <gnarf> local function vars are reset on every call unless "static" in like every language
[08:59:23] <Frazzz> im sure i tried this when i first started the project though:s
[08:59:25] <chinoto> js> var a={b:1}; print('b' in a); print('c' in a);
[08:59:25] * Frazzz tries again
[08:59:45] <chinoto> I think we killed it :/
[08:59:48] <gnarf> chinoto; true/false ;)
[09:00:05] <gnarf> js> print('b' in {b:1})
[09:00:14] <gnarf> `api test
[09:00:14] <b-ot> gnarf: No matches.
[09:00:24] <gnarf> eh - the eval js stuff on that bot is janky
[09:00:37] <duch_kazatel> we should just setup a oftn-bot in here imo
[09:00:39] <gnarf> someone might be PM attacking it
[09:00:51] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: b-ot is open source
[09:00:54] <chinoto> ##javascript's js bot is much better.
[09:00:55] <gnarf> for the most part
[09:01:10] <duch_kazatel> gnarf which one is it?
[09:01:13] <gnarf> how often do you need to execute inline JS in IRC in #jquery ?
[09:01:31] <duch_kazatel> good point.
[09:01:34] <gnarf>  /join #irc-js
[09:01:41] <gnarf> their bot doesn't have
[09:01:51] <chinoto> Not often, but it's useful for showing simple stuff.
[09:01:53] <gnarf> `api event.stopImmediatePropagation() @duch_kazatel
[09:01:53] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: No matches.
[09:01:59] <gnarf> `api event.stopImmediatePropagation @duch_kazatel
[09:01:59] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: event.stopImmediatePropagation():  Keeps the rest of the handlers from being executed and prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree.    http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[09:02:08] <gnarf> chinoto: so is fiddle
[09:02:09] <duch_kazatel> well there we go.
[09:02:13] <gnarf> chinoto: arguably more so
[09:02:24] <gnarf> chinoto: or jsbin
[09:02:39] <chinoto> gnarf: I actually had them in mind when I said that.
[09:02:42] <gnarf> inline js is for like "trickery" that you probably shouldn't use in production code anywya
[09:03:01] <gnarf> but yeah, i'd like a better eval in b-ot
[09:03:05] <gnarf> someone add it to the project
[09:03:05] <gnarf> :)
[09:03:07] <duch_kazatel> sometiems it's helpful to demonstrate certain points, but i agree it's not a common thing.
[09:03:27] <gnarf> its just a nodejs bot
[09:05:22] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: No output.
[09:05:27] <b-ot> gnarf: true
[09:05:32] <b-ot> chinoto: true false

[09:06:04] <gnarf> b-ot: would you like a cookie?
[09:06:04] <b-ot> gnarf: my sources say no.
[09:06:39] <gnarf> okay then
[09:06:56] <gnarf> b-ot for some reason can parse like any language
[09:07:00] <gnarf> c> print("bah")
[09:07:16] <gnarf> or like at least does some scala or lispy
[09:07:22] <gnarf> forget what langs it does
[09:07:28] <b-ot> gnarf: No output.
[09:07:33] <gnarf> https://github.com/nlogax/ircjsbot-plugins

[09:07:45] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: welp
[09:07:49] <gnarf> does ##javascript do this:
[09:07:53] <gnarf> `caniuse box-shadow
[09:07:54] <b-ot> gnarf: You can use CSS3 Box-shadow with: Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 3.5, Chrome 4, Safari 5, Opera 10.5, iOS Safari 4.0-4.1, and Opera Mobile 11. http://caniuse.com/#search=css-boxshadow
[09:08:01] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:08:12] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/oftn/oftn-bot is what they use.
[09:08:19] <Frazzz> http://jsfiddle.net/NS9Uy/ << see
[09:08:36] <Frazzz> the property object is meant to be a blueprint for reuse
[09:08:40] <gnarf> dude frazz
[09:08:43] <duch_kazatel> Frazzz why do you need p to be a global like that?
[09:09:03] <gnarf> Frazzz: here: http://jsfiddle.net/NS9Uy/1/
[09:09:17] <gnarf> fixed with the "temp" http://jsfiddle.net/NS9Uy/3/
[09:09:27] <Frazzz> gnarf yes i know
[09:09:37] <Frazzz> but i create these objects in a few different places
[09:09:39] <gnarf> Frazzz: if you want to clone from a default
[09:09:44] <Frazzz> so i dont want to do that every time
[09:09:52] <gnarf> var shallowClone = _.extend({}, original);
[09:10:08] <gnarf> $.
[09:10:08] <gnarf> sorry
[09:10:29] <gnarf> (can you tell i have lodash in my current environment? :) )
[09:10:42] <gnarf> `api jQuery.extend @Frazzz
[09:10:42] <b-ot> Frazzz: jQuery.extend(): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[09:10:46] <Frazzz> whats wrong with my original method?
[09:10:53] <Frazzz> aside from easing mysteriously not working
[09:11:13] <gnarf> Frazzz: "new constructor" has other implications which aren't really needed or desired for this use case
[09:11:44] <duch_kazatel> crockford's got some good writings about it that explains it pretty well.  in this particular case, you don't need it.
[09:12:05] <gnarf> i mean, if you were actually creating function Keyframe() { $.extend(this, Keyframe.defaults); }   Keyframe.prototype.someMethod = function() {}; etc
[09:12:13] <gnarf> ^^^ that makes more sense
[09:12:27] <gnarf> object literals are also super fucking quick
[09:12:34] <gnarf> whereas function invocation isn't
[09:12:37] <gnarf> but hey
[09:12:41] <gnarf> thats micro-opts
[09:12:53] <Frazzz> hm ok. cos im doing this for all my objects:(
[09:12:59] <Frazzz> guess its time for some reworking
[09:13:06] <gnarf> Frazzz: also, subtly
[09:13:10] <gnarf> you can forget/leave off a new
[09:13:17] <chinoto> I'll premature optimize all I want dammit!
[09:13:23] <gnarf> and totall fuck your "global object" with your constructor
[09:13:52] <gnarf> object literals make the most sense, unless you WANT a use a prototype chain
[09:14:06] <tables> what is a good javascript modal that looks modern or one that i can put any type of html in?
[09:14:32] <gnarf> tables: i usually use jquery ui dialog
[09:14:52] <duch_kazatel> jqmodal also works.
[09:15:01] <chinoto> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[09:15:08] <gnarf> its probably the most accessible (works properly with screen readers) - and the styles can all be tweaked
[09:15:11] <chinoto> It isn't loading for me for some reason...
[09:15:35] <gh2> any alternative to high stocks (http://www.highcharts.com/products/highstock)? any free or open source which can be used on commercial sites also?
[09:15:39] <gh2> any alternative to high stocks (http://www.highcharts.com/products/highstock)? any free or open source which can be used on commercial sites also?
[09:15:42] <gnarf> chinoto: try again?
[09:15:43] <chinoto> grrr
[09:15:47] <chinoto> I have
[09:15:50] <Frazzz> what if i need to pass parameters to the new object?
[09:15:56] <gnarf> chinoto: it took a second for mine
[09:15:58] <gnarf> but it loaded
[09:16:11] <gnarf> Frazzz: then you probably want a constructor
[09:16:20] <chinoto> Frazzz: Use another object on $.extend
[09:16:22] <gnarf> or some "create me a thing" object
[09:16:32] <gnarf> but dont use "this" unless you want the prototype modle
[09:16:58] <gnarf> like just do function getAThing(withParameters) { return { mything: withParameters }; }
[09:17:04] <chinoto> Now http://jqueryui.com/ is behaving
[09:17:19] <gnarf> chinoto: yeah, not sure what was wrong there
[09:17:24] <Frazzz> ok
[09:17:27] <gnarf> chinoto: ping me if you see other troubles with it today
[09:17:49] <gnarf> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/ more useful
[09:21:53] <haemus> Hello, does anybody know how I can change CSS Animation values with Javascript/Jquery
[09:21:53] <haemus> For example: @-webkit-keyframes testc {
[09:21:53] <haemus>         from {background: red;}
[09:21:53] <haemus>         to {background: yellow;}
[09:21:53] <haemus>     }
[09:21:53] <haemus> change the color red to blue in the animation
[09:22:01] <duch_kazatel> don't paste in the channel, haemus
[09:22:53] <Es0teric> hi everybody
[09:24:32] <Es0teric> lets say I have an a variable that grabs an element using find, then el.remove()… i want to insert a new div in the same position of the element that was just removed… how do i do that?
[09:25:03] <MikeD_> insert before you remove it?
[09:25:19] <Es0teric> MikeD_: insert after its removed
[09:26:00] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you can't without somehow storing that.  why not use .replace() instead?
[09:26:21] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: sec, let me look at that method
[09:26:35] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric that'll replace the element, so you don't need to remove it first.
[09:27:02] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: ok so i want to replace the parent with a new element and append
[09:27:58] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: also how do i find which item location that element is when theres duplicates of the same element (duplicate classes)
[09:28:01] <duch_kazatel> you could also do .replaceWith()
[09:28:13] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric could you share a test case?
[09:28:13] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: yeah i was looking at that too
[09:28:24] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: sec
[09:28:28] <Es0teric> i can whip something up real quick
[09:29:45] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: i cannot make a fiddle though but i can create html
[09:30:01] <Frazzz> using what you suggested gnarf, easing is still missing:s
[09:30:06] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric that'd be great.
[09:30:29] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric maybe with comments saying what you trying to do?
[09:34:11] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel -> http://pastie.org/private/uiso1nc8dgaa0qi0gqlpq
[09:34:20] <duch_kazatel> >.> can you put that in a fiddle instead?>
[09:34:22] <duch_kazatel> i'm lazy.
[09:34:26] <Es0teric> i dont have the time
[09:34:43] <duch_kazatel> ...
[09:34:58] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: i simply want to grab the position the class “latestItem” is in and replace it with something else
[09:35:06] <ceterizine|work> http://jsfiddle.net/EWILL3532/qtyEC/ I would like each box to fade into each other
[09:35:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/dV7gJ/
[09:35:09] <duch_kazatel> that's all i needed.
[09:35:21] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: i thought you meant as in the js >.>
[09:35:21] <duch_kazatel> which "latestItem", Es0teric?
[09:35:41] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: the latestItem that has an id that matches
[09:35:51] <Es0teric> so i would already have a var that has an id
[09:35:56] <ceterizine|work> meh, forgot to update http://jsfiddle.net/EWILL3532/qtyEC/1/
[09:36:14] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric huh?  not making sense.  none of those have an ID on them.  i need you do clarify.
[09:36:18] <duch_kazatel> *you to
[09:36:30] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel you see {postID} ?  thats the placeholder for an id
[09:36:37] <Es0teric> for THIS purpose
[09:36:38] <gnarf> Frazzz: can you get "more" of the code into a jsbin/fiddle ?
[09:36:48] <gnarf> Frazzz: like enough to reproduce your problem?
[09:37:12] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric okay - so you're selecting on an a and want to replace its parent?
[09:37:22] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: bingo
[09:37:53] <Es0teric> but each location is important, so locations could be 1-3 (top to bottom), if its on location 3, i want to ouput a specific div
[09:37:56] <EminenceHC> I am struggling to extract numerical values from this array [["Bill Hicks",39],["Bill2 Hicks2",77]] How can I pull all values out into a single flattened array?
[09:38:03] <Es0teric> if its on location 1,the div would also be different
[09:38:14] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/dV7gJ/1/
[09:38:17] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[09:38:29] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: read up
[09:38:33] <Es0teric> i wrote more stuff… =_=
[09:38:34] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC array[0][1]
[09:38:56] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric i read that - you're not asking your question very clearly.
[09:39:14] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric are you enumerating through each of those anchors?
[09:39:19] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel, lets say each latestItem class is assigned a number from top to bottom
[09:39:38] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric let's not just "say" - update the fiddle.
[09:40:12] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: its all in the fiddle.. there are 4 latestItem classes… from top to bottom thats 1-4, if i want to replace #3 which node is that to inject a new div into it?
[09:40:14] <gh2> any alternative to high stocks (http://www.highcharts.com/products/highstock)? any free or open source which can be used on commercial sites also?
[09:42:11] <gnarf> Es0teric: $(selected).closest(".lastestItem").replaceWith( newThing ) doesn't work why
[09:42:19] <Frazzz> gnarf not really, theres 2 plugins working together with callbacks so its a bit awkward
[09:42:20] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric try .index() then.
[09:42:39] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric there's also .eq()
[09:42:45] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric http://jsfiddle.net/dV7gJ/3/
[09:43:01] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: ok now thats what i am talking about
[09:43:23] <duch_kazatel> kay
[09:44:18] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: ok so index() == 2, but replaceAll() doesnt actually inject the content
[09:44:32] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric huh?
[09:44:40] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to replace that node?
[09:44:45] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: yes
[09:44:51] <duch_kazatel> that's exactly what my code does.
[09:45:10] <duch_kazatel> it finds the third .latestItem and replaces it with something else.
[09:46:33] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: but it already knows which node its in when i do .find()
[09:46:37] <Es0teric> right?
[09:46:43] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:46:51] <Frazzz> has anyone had any experience using the transit library?
[09:46:59] <duch_kazatel> i'm not using .find() there, so you'll need to update the example, Es0teric
[09:47:18] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: you’ll have to give me a minute because i am at work
[09:47:26] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric so am I ;)
[09:47:35] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: alright cool lol
[09:47:47] <Frazzz> i pass my transition object to the transition function, and after the transition is run, the duration becomes undefined. any idea if this is part of the library?
[09:48:02] <Frazzz> im having to reset the duration every time i run a transition
[09:49:29] <Frazzz> its also resetting the reasing property. but all other properties in the object stay as is. its strange
[09:49:37] <Frazzz> easing*
[09:58:56] <disappearedng> Hey are jquery plugins out there that will generate a bunch of dates based on a start_date, end_date, and a pattern (every other day, weekly, every month, etc) ?
[10:00:14] <duch_kazatel> disappearedng http://momentjs.com/ might have some stuff that can help you
[10:00:20] <haemus> date.js
[10:00:23] <haemus> or momentjs
[10:00:26] <haemus> as duch said
[10:00:30] <disappearedng> I don't have problem generating FYI
[10:00:40] <disappearedng> i just need a UI where my users can select what pattern they want
[10:00:46] <disappearedng> and I will generate the dates myself and store it in my db
[10:01:08] <EminenceHC> I have a simple ajax call which fetches the information just fine but it is not in a proper array. How can I have this call return an array instead of a flat list? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/3af20ea9a6711555ca95 If i visit my path manually I get [["Bill Hicks",39],["Bill2 Hicks2",77]] but the ajax call returns Bill Hicks,39, Bill2 Hicks2,77
[10:01:27] <duch_kazatel> jquery-ui has some built in widgets.  you could combine that with a gcal-style selection setup.
[10:01:52] <gnarf> disappearedng: sounds like two datepickers and a select box?
[10:02:28] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC could you console.log(data) inside of your done and share the result in a new gist?
[10:02:32] <gnarf> EminenceHC: dataType: "json"
[10:03:08] <disappearedng> well and a <select> box with these options: 1. Weekly, 2. Monthly, 3. Quarterly, 4. Custom. If Weekly is chosen, show a select box for Monday, .. Sunday, if Monthly picked, Show a box with 1-31 option boxes, etc
[10:03:45] <gnarf> also, Array.prototype.toString is basically .join(",") - so if you are using "alert" instead of console.log "Bill Hicks,39,Bill2 Hicks2,77" might be the proper output
[10:03:57] <haemus> http://jsbin.com/fuyoqoyo/1/watch?html,output                       Does anybody know how to change values of CSS Animations through Javascript/JQuery?
[10:04:06] <haemus> In my example change one of the colors in the animation for example
[10:04:16] <gnarf> haemus: write to a <style> tag
[10:05:38] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Can an alert print an array?
[10:05:45] <gnarf> haemus: $("#jsstyles").remove(); $("<style id='jsstyles'>" + cssText + "</style>").appendTo("head")
[10:06:18] <haemus> gnarf can u have multiple style tags?
[10:06:27] <gnarf> haemus: obviously :)
[10:06:29] <haemus> ;p
[10:06:31] <haemus> ok
[10:06:43] <gnarf> haemus: but like, don't keep writing new ones if you can remove the old one
[10:06:46] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Looks like it is coming in as an array.. I was just printing it in an alert instead of console. Thanks for showing me how to check it in console.
[10:06:49] <haemus> yeah ok
[10:06:50] <haemus> thanks
[10:06:57] <gnarf> for every new selector you add, every element takes a little longer to render
[10:07:17] <gnarf> also, updating a <style> tag >WILL< invaidate the entire page render
[10:07:19] <gnarf> so its costly
[10:07:21] <disappearedng> gnarf: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collective/jquery.recurrenceinput.js/master/Screenshot.png found it
[10:07:24] <gnarf> don't do it on a loop or anything
[10:07:33] <gnarf> disappearedng: looks pretty nice
[10:13:28] <chinoto> gnarf: So you should make sure to to it all in one go, kinda like appending many elements to a single parent.
[10:13:43] <chinoto> s/to to/to do/
[10:14:17] <gnarf> chinoto: well, as long as you don't read anything that requires rendering, you can add/remove as much as you want, but yes, best to batch it, and best to not do it often (like don't change every frame)
[10:18:48] <jenia> hello
[10:19:17] <jenia> I want to create  a header for all my jquery mobile pages
[10:19:29] <jenia> so like one header in a page called: header.html
[10:19:39] <duch_kazatel> jenia do that in your backend if you can.
[10:19:50] <jenia> with templates?
[10:20:00] <duch_kazatel> what backend language are you using, jenia?
[10:20:16] <jenia> django's language
[10:20:24] <jenia> python but for the page rendering is django's template language
[10:20:37] <duch_kazatel> then use an include server-side to do it.
[10:20:46] <jenia> okay thanks
[10:24:33] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: alright i am back
[10:24:43] <duch_kazatel> 'KAY
[10:24:52] <duch_kazatel> woops capslock.
[10:29:05] <tables> what is a good javascript modal that looks modern or one that i can put any type of html in?
[10:29:14] <duch_kazatel> tables i like jqmodal
[10:29:20] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel -> http://jsfiddle.net/dV7gJ/4/
[10:29:41] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: -> http://jsfiddle.net/dV7gJ/5/****
[10:29:46] <Es0teric> http://jsfiddle.net/dV7gJ/5/ **
[10:30:18] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric okay... so you want lastestItemsWrap from a post?
[10:30:31] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: look at the second one
[10:30:37] <Es0teric> 5
[10:30:40] <duch_kazatel> i am.
[10:30:42] <tables> duch_kazatel, can i put my own code in jqmodal?
[10:30:47] <duch_kazatel> tables yes.
[10:30:55] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel no i want latestItem from a post
[10:30:57] <tables> i want it looking purely like my own html code
[10:31:01] <tables> or as much as possible
[10:31:04] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric $('.latestItem').find('a#post1').parent().parent(); - that puts you at .latestItemsWrap
[10:31:12] <duch_kazatel> tables then you can do that.
[10:31:18] <duch_kazatel> tables you can give it anything you want.
[10:31:30] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: whoops i forgot a level, sec let me update this
[10:31:56] <duch_kazatel> tables we use it at my company for all kinds of things - you can use its defaults or override them with whatever you want.
[10:32:51] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: -> http://jsfiddle.net/dV7gJ/6/
[10:32:52] <Es0teric> there we go
[10:33:09] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric which element do you want from the post?
[10:33:30] <duch_kazatel> you want it's latestItem?
[10:33:36] <Es0teric> i want .latestItem but if post3 gets removed, i want to inject a div in place of that item
[10:33:45] <Es0teric> on that specific location
[10:33:48] <duch_kazatel> $('#post1').parents('.latestItem');i
[10:33:59] <duch_kazatel> *$('#post1').parents('.latestItem'); - if you're selecting off an id, just use the id.
[10:34:14] <duch_kazatel> your last statement doesn't make sense.
[10:34:30] <antlong_> i have a ui component that filters the current selection by a key, i have a couple of keys i want to combine though so it reduces the total pages, how would i do that? https://dpaste.de/T2EY
[10:34:46] <duch_kazatel> you mean if there is no post# under a latestItem, you want to replace that latestItem?
[10:35:46] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: no i mean if theres a post# i want to replace the parent of that post with a differnt div
[10:35:53] <Es0teric> but i want it to be in that same exact location
[10:36:14] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric so you want to replace the parent of #post3 ?
[10:36:19] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: yes
[10:36:34] <duch_kazatel> $('#post3').parents('.latestItem'); gets you where you want then/.
[10:36:37] <duch_kazatel> replace that.
[10:36:43] <Es0teric> then chain replaceAll()?
[10:36:49] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/dV7gJ/8/
[10:36:50] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[10:37:19] <duch_kazatel> there's also a .closest().
[10:40:35] <BillCriswell> collapsing margins seem weird to me.
[10:53:28] <antlong_> i have a ui component that filters the current selection by a key, i have a couple of keys i want to combine though so it reduces the total pages, how would i do that? https://dpaste.de/T2EY
[10:56:36] <haemus> anybody here familiar with SVG?
[10:56:44] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ huh?
[10:57:37] <antlong_> duch_kazatel in the paste, that array is what this.keys is. i want to combine all of the gear keys in the ui, so that 5 or 6 selections are shown in one
[10:57:50] <antlong_> duch_kazatel combining the display of 5 selections essentially
[10:58:17] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ step away from the UI bit - not sure what that has to do with.  do you want gear to be an array as well?
[10:58:26] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: use closest not parents
[10:58:29] <gnarf> cc Es0teric
[10:58:45] <duch_kazatel> gnarf i'm so used to just using .parents().
[10:58:50] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: untrain yourself of that
[10:58:53] <gnarf> its not good
[10:58:57] <duch_kazatel> whyfor?
[10:59:00] <gnarf> .closest() can only ever return one
[10:59:01] <antlong_> duch_kazatel i don't particularly care, as long as it's displayed correctly. i just want it so all gear is displayed together, instead of individually by type
[10:59:06] <gnarf> it also stops when it finds the match
[10:59:18] <gnarf> .parents(sel) is .parents().filter(sel)
[10:59:24] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[10:59:26] <duch_kazatel> good to know.
[10:59:34] <gnarf> well, one per input
[10:59:51] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ still not following what you mean.  sorry!  maybe somebody else can help :)
[10:59:54] <gnarf> i.e. jQuerySetWith5Items.closest('div') length would be 5 or less if they shared divs
[11:00:25] <duch_kazatel> gnarf yeah i see that now.  there are times where i need all ancestors that share the selector, but I didn't think about the implications when you want only one.
[11:00:29] <antlong_> >.<
[11:02:35] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ i see an array and something about one of those objects "containing" other values, and then you keep mentioning something about a display.  are you trying to iterate through array 1 and, if it hits another array, iterate through each of the elements of that "child" before moving on to the next one in the "parent"?
[11:05:11] <antlong_> duch_kazatel the array in that paste ["mining", "gear head", "gear foo"], determine the content in the large grey box http://imgur.com/7gTzJ4P . its a "selectionFilter" in the code. I'm trying to combine some of them, so one filter contains a group of them.
[11:07:57] <duch_kazatel> aaaah i wish my coworkers would stop using .attr() all the time.
[11:08:21] <BillCriswell> I wish margin collapsing wasn't a thing from the start.
[11:08:33] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell tackling some CSS today?
[11:08:52] <gnarf> BillCriswell: margin collapse is evil, unless you are doing typesetting :)
[11:08:54] <gnarf> try writing an effects library
[11:08:54] <gnarf> then complain about margin collapse ;)
[11:09:32] <gnarf> btw BillCriswell : http://bocoup.com/weblog/new-overflow-default/
[11:09:46] <gnarf> BillCriswell: interesting bit in there about collapsing margins
[11:09:51] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yes.
[11:09:59] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Haha I have jQuery for that!
[11:10:21] <gnarf> BillCriswell: we don't really deal with margin-collapsing problems tho
[11:10:25] <gnarf> just kind of avoid them
[11:11:21] <gnarf> jQuery UI effects actually breaks if the animated things have margins, because it encloses them in a overflow: hidden to get some of the clippy type effects
[11:11:35] <gnarf> kind of a "cant fix"
[11:11:41] <gnarf> we spent a long time trying to think of it
[11:11:51] <gnarf> and we eventually gave up
[11:12:02] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Never knew how troublesome it actually was for you guys.
[11:12:42] <BillCriswell> gnarf: This article is great, and the bocoup logo is "logo" is awesome haha
[11:12:54] <gnarf> margin collapse on position: static, relative are painful
[11:12:57] <BillCriswell> Oh wow, this is recent too.

[11:13:49] <b-ot> j0ntsang: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:14:21] <j0ntsang> Is it possible to point an AJAX call to a function to get it's return value?
[11:14:34] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:15:19] <BillCriswell> Splitting like crazy today.
[11:16:12] <thebope> lol wow yea
[11:16:37] <thebope> all back
[11:17:29] <j0ntsang> can an AJAX call be pointed to a function and get it's return value, from within the same page
[11:18:01] <duch_kazatel> j0ntsang $.ajax() points at a URL, not at a function.
[11:18:55] <duch_kazatel> you can call other functions inside those callbacks or call functions to fill values in the call, but you can't set the URL to something else on the page - can you fiddle up a rough idea of what you're trying to do?
[11:19:20] <fonsA2> Hello. I'm trying to get a pop ad script working on my site. It seems to be conflicting with something in Bootstrap (either the JS or CSS). I believe it has something to due to the pop ad script using "simplemodal" and it's conflicting with Bootstraps Modal (maybe due to the naming convention). Test site here: http://www.jobjogger.com/adjector-test.html
[11:19:53] <fonsA2> but I can't quite pinpoint what it is.
[11:20:08] <fonsA2> the banner doesn't load but it executes the function.
[11:21:49] <gnarf> BillCriswell: the overflow auto article? yeah - greg just published it after a great talk here in the office
[11:38:51] <antlong_> duch_kazatel did you get my reply a little while ago?
[11:40:45] <duch_kazatel> yes, still not sure what you're talking about.  sorry.
[11:44:05] <randomDude000> Hey people, can I do something like $(document).on("load","iframe",function(){console.log('another iframe loaded');}); ??
[11:44:12] <randomDude000> Because it isn't working for me
[11:45:34] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/ - "In all browsers, the load, scroll, and error events (e.g., on an <img> element) do not bubble."
[11:47:06] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: So then how can I wait until iframe has loaded?
[11:47:12] <decx> it's already been loaded before dom ready
[11:47:22] <duch_kazatel> randomDude000 bind to the element directly.
[11:47:58] <randomDude000> $("iframe").load(...)?
[11:48:15] <duch_kazatel> $('iframe').on('load', function(){}); works, too.
[11:49:06] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: The question is.. will it wait for other iframe to load even after the first one?
[11:49:14] <duch_kazatel> randomDude000 huh?
[11:49:16] <antlong_> duch_kazatel www.multiverseminer.com click on the arrow icons on the left side panel
[11:49:26] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ can't atm - at work.
[11:49:42] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: let me try and I'll see if it solved it
[11:49:52] <duch_kazatel> randomDude000 that'll bind to each iframe and fire the callback for each
[11:50:36] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: What if the iframe is created after page load?
[11:50:52] <duch_kazatel> randomDude000 then you need to directly bind after it's been created.
[11:51:26] <duch_kazatel> the load event doesn't bubble, so you can't use delegation in this case - you need to select them after they've been added to the page.
[11:51:46] <randomDude000> =\
[11:51:47] <randomDude000> Crap
[11:51:49] <randomDude000> Oh well
[11:51:51] <randomDude000> Thanks
[11:52:02] <duch_kazatel> how are you adding the iframes?
[11:52:40] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: Don't even ask... I'm working for this company and they are still using iframes all over and I need to fix their stupid code
[11:52:55] <duch_kazatel> randomDude000 i used to work with iframes pretty regularly.
[11:52:58] <duch_kazatel> it's not that bad.
[11:53:17] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: Well, it's not practicle now a days.
[11:53:37] <duch_kazatel> it can be totally practical depending on what you need to do.  just another tool in the toolbelt.
[11:53:53] <decx> someone didnt have to deal with a "communication iframe" yet
[11:53:54] <decx> yuk
[11:54:14] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: Sure, but if you're using iframes to do what a regular modal should be doing, then you're doing it wrong.
[11:54:20] <randomDude000> And that's what they are doing
[11:54:32] <duch_kazatel> we use iframes in modals sometimes here.
[11:55:01] <duch_kazatel> i worked at a place that offered a whitelabel solution to newspapers - sometimes newspapers needed to be able to host the content in their header and footer, so we'd slap their stuff in iframes.
[11:55:34] <duch_kazatel> they get abused plenty, i'll agree, but by themselves they're not too terrible.
[11:56:43] <antlong_> i have a component that filters content by a key, i have a couple of keys i want to combine though so it reduces the total pages, how would i do that? https://dpaste.de/T2EY
[12:03:28] <Ansikt> Hi.  I'm currently preventing users from entering letters in a text field by checking e.which, and only permitting the char codes for number keys.  I would like to also add the ability to copy and paste in this field.   How do I go about doing this?
[12:04:52] <MikeD_> you get that without doing anything
[12:05:06] <ornerymoose> im using the jquery cycle plugin and its quite easy to set up: in my carousel i have anywhere from 3-5 images that are always displayed as thumbnails on the page. However when i implement the cycle plugin it only/always shows one image (the first image) of the carousel. Why the heck is this? I want to always show all the thumbnails...is there a workaround?
[12:05:11] <decx> there's a paste event that you can bind iirc
[12:06:44] <Ansikt> MikeD_, It's preventingDefault for keyDown for all letters, including C, V, and X.  As a result, CTRL+C, CTRL+V, and CTRL+X do not work.
[12:07:16] <Ansikt> ornerymoose: I use that plugin and am rather familiar.  I shouldn't be doing what you describe.  Can you provide a code sample or a fiddle?
[12:07:33] <Ansikt> decx: paste event isn't firing because hot keys to paste are being prevented.
[12:07:50] <MikeD_> you could stop preventing them
[12:08:27] <Ansikt> MikeD_: Talk to my UX designer.  Unless there's a better way to prevent non-numeric input, of course.
[12:09:13] <MikeD_> the better way to prevent it is to check for C and V and further decide what to do based on whether the CTRL key is also pressed
[12:09:16] <Ansikt> MikeD_: (I do, of course agree with you.  Were it my site, I wouldn't want this behavior.)
[12:10:01] <decx> add e.ctrlKey && e.which === 86 to your exceptions
[12:11:25] <ornerymoose> Ansikt: ill show the code but a fiddle may be a pain in this case, the images are loaded in the admin dashboard and the js is kinda hectic to start with: http://codeshare.io/PeHKD
[12:11:38] <ornerymoose> see line 128
[12:11:55] <ornerymoose> defined there but called on line 53
[12:12:46] <MikeD_> decx: what is a meta key?  http://api.jquery.com/event.metaKey/
[12:14:16] <Ansikt> MikeD_: That's the Windows Key.
[12:14:35] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: I think it's command on a mac and ctrl on windows?
[12:14:40] <Ansikt> ....probably something different on mac, though.
[12:14:47] <decx> yes
[12:14:50] <solenzo> hello everybody
[12:15:09] <solenzo> mai i ask a quesion somebody who knows something about embeding svg documents
[12:15:10] <solenzo> ?
[12:15:41] <MikeD_> ewe mai
[12:15:42] <NoiseEee> you can try solenzo
[12:15:49] <NoiseEee> don't ask to ask
[12:15:50] <solenzo> i have a problem with webkit browser. I load a page via load method than animate right to 0
[12:15:53] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Is that english?
[12:16:14] <solenzo> after that using get(0).contentdocument i get handle and try to change fill on one rect by id
[12:16:14] <MikeD_> ewe is a sheep
[12:16:21] <solenzo> everything is working on FF
[12:16:27] <solenzo> but webkit fails
[12:16:30] <BillCriswell> mai?
[12:17:01] <solenzo> it sees
[12:17:05] <MikeD_> idk, i thought we were talking in homophonic misspellings
[12:17:12] <solenzo> in ajax load that svg in object is html document
[12:17:23] <solenzo> but clicking on that loaded page same action
[12:17:24] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what's going on now haha
[12:17:34] <solenzo> it sees it as svgdocument object and everything is working fine
[12:17:41] <Novocaine> Hi all, is there anybody up to help me on a little thing i didn't catch with jquery toggleClass (addClass / removeClass) please?
[12:17:58] <solenzo> what is wrong with change fill attribute in svg after loading page via ajax in webkit?
[12:18:07] <BillCriswell> Novocaine: What's the issue?
[12:18:32] <solenzo> NoiseEee: will you eventually help me :)?
[12:18:45] <NoiseEee> solenzo: i'd think it has less to do about 'change fill' not working and more about accessing the SVG properly? do you have sample code on a pastebin anywhere?
[12:19:04] <solenzo> NoiseEee: hang on a second
[12:19:52] <ornerymoose> Ansikt: http://i.imgur.com/dQPQ6T5.png this is how my page looks without/with the jquery cycle function implemented
[12:20:28] <Novocaine> BillCriswell: i have a page with several boxes (floating), the first box on the first line is higher than the others, when i click on another box, the bigger one reduce and the clicked one increase it works with all the boxes except the first one that dissapear in the background instead of reducing like the others
[12:20:34] <ornerymoose> just dont understand why implementing it would hide the carousel...makes no sense to me.
[12:21:15] <BillCriswell> Novocaine: I'd try to make a demo on jsfiddle.net or something.
[12:21:26] <Novocaine> BillCriswell: i can send you the file to see the behavior if you prefer
[12:21:43] <BillCriswell> Novocaine: The fiddle would be easier.
[12:22:24] <Novocaine> BillCriswell: ok
[12:22:28] <Ansikt> ornerymoose: I think I understand your problem.
[12:22:46] <solenzo> NoiseEee: are you there?
[12:22:52] <solenzo> http://pastebin.com/mkkqadar
[12:22:54] <NoiseEee> solenzo: somewhat
[12:23:16] <ornerymoose> Ansikt: cool, what do you think it may be?
[12:23:17] <solenzo> first function is call on ajax load page from right:-100% to 0
[12:24:51] <solenzo> AND PROBLEM IS firefox when loading via ajax that svg element is SVGDOCUMENT , clicking link on loaded page also SVGDOCUMENT
[12:25:16] <solenzo> but on webkit in animate function after loading is HTMLDOCUMENT but clickin link is XMLDOCUMENT
[12:25:24] <solenzo> on firefox everything works perfectly
[12:25:36] <solenzo> on webkit only when clicking on loaded page
[12:25:44] <solenzo> a icannot mark place when loading map
[12:26:11] <solenzo>  thx for your time NoiseEee  :)
[12:26:32] <Ansikt> ornerymoose: That's the expected behavior.  It takes some dom elements, then slides them about.  You're going to have to duplicate the DOM for the slider area as well.
[12:26:44] <NoiseEee> solenzo: you're working with an <svg> element or <object> ?
[12:26:58] <solenzo> NoiseEee: object
[12:27:06] <solenzo> i can add that
[12:27:16] <solenzo> before i worked on iframe and iframe worked on webkit
[12:27:19] <solenzo> but i cannot
[12:27:22] <solenzo> make overlay on iframe
[12:27:32] <solenzo> so that on iphone i can scroll easily
[12:28:04] <NoiseEee> solenzo: and "/praca/Artinkubator_Home/Page/api/Get_Map#item" is returning an svg ?
[12:28:30] <solenzo> no that link return whole page 2 collums and other stuff with links
[12:28:38] <solenzo> and that 4 objects
[12:28:43] <solenzo> with svg
[12:28:52] <solenzo> i hide them with display none
[12:29:44] <ornerymoose> Ansikt: I see. I'm a bit of a novice so do you mean using something like .clone() on .thumbsHolder within the cycleImage function?
[12:30:31] <solenzo> NoiseEee: on that page there are 4 part with classes level[0-4] when user choose level i hide 3 of 4 and show only that div with level[number] select by user in "choose level" accordion
[12:30:41] <Novocaine> BillCriswell: i made a fiddle but i'm not able to get js working ...
[12:31:21] <DragoonDM> Hey guys, hoping someone can help me out with a question. I'm using a the JQuery UI .draggable() function on a div, and then updating several other divs' positions based on the draggable div (using it as a resize handle). This is doing what I want it to do, but there's a delay between moving the draggable object and the other divs updating. Is there any way to make this more responsive? (Code: http://pastebin.com/RJFcqJw
[12:31:38] <NoiseEee> solenzo: i dunno, sorry... try adding 'debugger' in after line 35 and see what 'svgdata' really is maybe
[12:32:12] <NoiseEee> solenzo: try isolating the problem. in general i find webkit and firefox to have no problem grabbing the contentDocument from an object using svg
[12:32:30] <solenzo> i tried isolating the problem from 3 days :D
[12:33:25] <solenzo> and found that #('div').load -> animate  and in animate svg is htmldocument which when i try to get attribute returns null
[12:33:50] <solenzo> but on loaded page and calling a.on click event on the same code return XMLDOCUMENT
[12:33:54] <solenzo> which works
[12:34:33] <solenzo> i dont understand why it is changins the type of object
[12:34:42] <solenzo> using contendocument
[12:35:19] <solenzo> NoiseEee: maybe you can help me with making an overlay on iframe?
[12:35:42] <solenzo> on object no problem but on iframe i cant
[12:36:40] <Ansikt> ornerymoose - well, I think I might not quite understand your goals.  Are you trying to make the larger image be the one shown in the carousel?
[12:37:05] <ornerymoose> Ansikt: yes, correct.
[12:37:09] <ornerymoose> Well,
[12:37:15] <NoiseEee> solenzo: reduce it to animating the object, no loading anything else. i can't see why 'load' would affect it at all
[12:37:35] <NoiseEee> solenzo: my guess is that maybe <svg> can be animated correctly, but <object src="someSVG"> probably cant be / isnt meant to be
[12:37:49] <ornerymoose> Currently there are 3 images shown in the carousel (when I dont use the cycle plugin or have it commented out). When I implement the cycle, only one image shows (3 images should ALWAYS be shown).
[12:37:59] <Novocaine> BillCriswell: Fiddle is working with js now, i can send the link if you want
[12:38:08] <BillCriswell> Novocaine: Sure thing.
[12:38:18] <ornerymoose> the range of images can be anywhere from 3 images to 6
[12:38:27] <Ansikt> ornerymoose: are you using Cycle or Cycle2?  Here's the demo I'd suggest you look at for cycle2: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/caro-pager.php
[12:38:31] <Novocaine> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/7xHAq/9/
[12:38:48] <Ansikt> There's also one for the orignial plugin which works roughly the same.
[12:39:13] <ornerymoose> Ah, that is a great example.
[12:39:41] <solenzo> NoiseEee: i cant reduce it to animating only object because I slide whole page from right -100% to right 0 height 100%. ohter think is that i manipulate in svg dom After animate complete in complete: function
[12:39:44] <NoiseEee> solenzo: you might also want to look at svg-specific libs to help, like http://www.svgjs.com/
[12:39:50] <solenzo> so that shoudn't be a problem
[12:42:03] <Novocaine> BillCriswell: i probably miss something like the first box didn't have any class that's maybe the issue now that i'm thinking of it ...
[12:45:46] <Absolute0> How do I get invited into #javascript?
[12:46:15] <Zzaichik> ##javascript

[12:46:48] <Zzaichik> don't know - that's just the room you want.

[12:54:37] <BillCriswell> decx: Never knew that.

[13:02:11] <Amnesia> question, how's it possible that $('.inputfield').val('foobar') ; $('.inputfield').attr('value') returns '' instead of 'foobar'?
[13:02:22] <Novocaine> BillCriswell: solved the issue to my problem, not sure it's the best way to do it but it works ... i put this -> class="box box2" instead of class="box2" now the bigger box reduce to the normal size while the clicked one increase its size
[13:02:56] <decx> value is a property, attribute is staticish
[13:03:16] <BillCriswell> Novocaine: Nice. Sorry I was just going nuts with something at work.
[13:04:38] <Amnesia> decx: hm, let me google that :)
[13:05:21] <decx> <input type="text" value=""> if you enter something in that input the attribute doesn't change
[13:05:35] <Novocaine> BillCriswell: No problem, sometimes explaining an issue to someone helps to find the solution :p
[13:05:59] <decx> and if you change value with val you change the value property and not the attribute
[13:06:17] <Amnesia> decx: is it correct that the properties are mainly a dom thing?
[13:06:30] <decx> just use val() without argument
[13:06:35] <decx> it'll return the value
[13:07:31] <Novocaine> BillCriswell: Anyway thx for offering your help and good luck at you work!
[13:07:47] <BillCriswell> Thanks.
[13:07:59] <decx> why do you need luck at work?
[13:09:10] <BillCriswell> Drupal.
[13:10:46] <Amnesia> decx: so would it be possible to select elements based on their properties?
[13:11:10] <decx> i only have outdated preconceptions about drupal is it still shit for actual endclients ?
[13:11:26] <decx> sure you can filter
[13:11:59] <chinoto> Amnesia: You could get all potential candidates and do .filter(function() {return $(this).prop(...);});
[13:12:42] <chinoto> well, wrapping it in jquery isn't even necessary...
[13:12:53] <chinoto> return this[...];
[13:13:00] <Amnesia> ty!
[13:13:06] <decx> hehe good old $(this)[0]
[13:13:08] <BillCriswell> decx: I just hate it.
[13:13:16] <chinoto> decx: oh dear god
[13:13:28] <Amnesia> so is it correct that properties are mainly a dom thing/
[13:13:29] <Amnesia> ?
[13:13:34] <chinoto> It could make sense if this was a selector.
[13:13:45] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: You could use .filter() and return based on certain property conditions.
[13:13:54] <decx> i have no idea about the semantics of the words
[13:14:06] <decx> so i guess properties are a dom thing?
[13:14:07] <Amnesia> chinoto/decx/BillCriswe: thanks
[13:14:12] <chinoto> Amnesia: They are attributes and properties are both part of elements, which are part of the DOM.
[13:14:14] <decx> isnt everything
[13:14:18] <decx> right
[13:14:21] <Amnesia> uhu
[13:14:31] <chinoto> s/They are//
[13:14:39] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: What property are you trying to select based on?
[13:15:25] <chinoto> Amnesia: And are you sure it's a property and not an attribute?
[13:15:25] <Amnesia> well if it was a value, the following would do the job: form_week.has("input[name='foobar'")
[13:15:36] <Amnesia> chinoto: yes I am
[13:16:30] <Amnesia> the value has been assigned to the input using .val(), and $('.inputfield').attr( returns ''
[13:16:36] <Amnesia> .attr('value') *
[13:17:13] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: You could do $('input').filter(function() { return this.name === 'foobar' });
[13:17:38] <Amnesia> ty
[13:17:46] <Amnesia> ah, that sort of property..
[13:17:49] <decx> i dont get how these are relatted
[13:17:55] <Amnesia> I just got my eureka moment..:p
[13:17:56] <decx> $('input').val('stuf ) sets the value to stuff, $('input').val() gets it
[13:18:12] <Amnesia> yep
[13:18:45] <bcardarella> Perhaps I am misunderstanding the api but I am trying to pause a qunit test suite. I thought QUnit.stop() would do that for me. But in this example it runs anyway: http://jsbin.com/ziqutojo/1/edit
[13:18:46] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: Do you mean a property's value and not the value property?
[13:19:21] <bcardarella> it looks like QUnit.stop needs to be used in a test.
[13:19:26] <decx> it's actually about evaluating property, amnesia is a real estate agent
[13:19:35] <BillCriswell> decx++
[13:19:43] <EminenceHC> Does anyone know how to remove all values of this multiselect? https://github.com/davidstutz/bootstrap-multiselect I try:  $("select#particular-schools").val(''); and  $("#particular-schools option:selected").removeAttr("selected"); but no dice.
[13:19:46] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: the property value
[13:19:47] <Amnesia> heh
[13:19:52] <bcardarella> But what if I wanted to pause the test suite with QUnit.begin, make an ajax call, then when that call is complete continue with the test suite?
[13:19:56] <chinoto> Amnesia: So in the filter, just do "return this.value;"
[13:20:14] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[13:20:18] <chinoto> modifications probably needed
[13:20:36] <gnarf> "properties" are DOM properties (on the DOM objects)  that have their initial values read from the HTML "attributes"
[13:20:48] <chinoto> yep
[13:20:54] <gnarf> not all attrs are props, and not all props are attrs
[13:20:57] <Amnesia> thanks everyone for your time...
[13:21:01] <gnarf> but enough of them share the same space
[13:21:05] <gnarf> that it's really fucking confusing
[13:21:08] <gnarf> THANKS DOM!
[13:21:34] <chinoto> And then you have boolean attributes that make the corresponding property true/false.
[13:21:43] <gnarf> i.e. - this.value !== this.getAttribute('value') after you start typing in the field, only the property updates on an input, the attr stays whatever was set in html
[13:23:01] <chinoto> I'm not sure what standard specifies it, but boolean attributes are supposed to be "x='x'", for example "selected='selected'"
[13:23:07] <Amnesia> so what'd be the question to check whether an element has a child, that's got a value property that contains 'foo' ?
[13:23:51] <chinoto> Amnesia: contains or equals 'foo'?
[13:24:23] <gnarf> chinoto: boolean properties not always reflected as true/false, for instance: http://jsbin.com/gokac/1/ -- disabled="" is "true"
[13:24:40] <gnarf> Amnesia: "value property"
[13:24:49] <Amnesia> chinoto: when it would've been the attribute 'value' I was looking for, it would be the following: form_week.has("input[value='foo']")
[13:24:53] <gnarf> Amnesia: only inputs, do selects matter?
[13:25:15] <chinoto> gnarf: I was saying how it's supposed to be written, the mere existence of the attribute is what makes it true.
[13:25:47] <chinoto> written according to some standard that I can't remember*
[13:26:04] <gnarf> $("input").filter(function() { return /foo/.test(this.value); })
[13:26:10] <gnarf> Amnesia ^
[13:26:29] <gnarf> or this.value.indexOf("foo") !== -1
[13:26:36] <gnarf> etc
[13:26:42] <Amnesia> but that's starting at the input field
[13:26:46] <gnarf> but <select> doesn't have a "value"
[13:26:48] <chinoto> gnarf: Append '.parent()' to that.
[13:26:53] <gnarf> chinoto: wrong
[13:26:54] <gnarf> closest
[13:26:55] <gnarf> but yeah
[13:27:08] <gnarf> Amnesia: start at input, find matches, traverse up is probably best
[13:27:09] <Amnesia> I've got a table, and I want to check whether there's an input field in the table that contains a value property with 'foo' as it's value
[13:27:20] <Amnesia> ah ok
[13:27:22] <gnarf> $("input", table).filter(...).length
[13:27:24] <gnarf> ^^^^
[13:27:28] <gnarf> only look in the table
[13:27:34] <gnarf> if you have a list of tables
[13:27:37] <Amnesia> muchas gracias
[13:27:37] <gnarf> and you want to figure out which
[13:28:00] <gnarf> tables.filter(function() { return $(this).find("input").filter(...).length; })
[13:28:10] <chinoto> gnarf: Amnesia said child not descendant "so what'd be the question to check whether an element has a child, that's got a value property that contains 'foo' ?"
[13:28:10] <BillCriswell> $('.form_week').filter(function() { return $(this).find('input').filter(function() { return this.val == 'foo'; }).length; }); could work,
[13:28:29] <fonsA2> 'm trying to get a pop ad script working on my site. It seems to be conflicting with something in Bootstrap (either the JS or CSS). I believe it has something to due to the pop ad script using "simplemodal" and it's conflicting with Bootstraps Modal (maybe due to the naming convention). Test site here: http://www.jobjogger.com/adjector-test.html
[13:28:34] <fonsA2> I'm*
[13:29:05] <gnarf> chinoto: usually easier / quicker to start from the children and look for the parent, but if you have ONE parent, and want to know if it has children, just contextify the selection
[13:29:07] <chinoto> BillCriswell: Why not use find directly?
[13:29:10] <gnarf> $("input", table)
[13:29:16] <BillCriswell> $('input').filter(function() { return this.value === 'foo' && $(this).closest('.form_body').length > 0; }) maybe?
[13:29:30] <gnarf> BillCriswell: maybe with map
[13:29:33] <gnarf> and return null
[13:29:35] <gnarf> but not with filter
[13:29:43] <Amnesia> lol, I guess I'll build a function for it then
[13:29:53] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: Having to do this feels weird.
[13:29:54] <gnarf> Amnesia: what is the actual use case
[13:30:28] <gnarf> table.find("input").filter( checkValue ).length <--- should do what you want
[13:30:34] <Amnesia> ehm, I'm fetching dates from a database, and a new table row should be added when it's a new date
[13:30:41] <gnarf> with checkValue being the function that takes "this" as an input and returns true or false
[13:30:47] <chinoto> You guys will figure it out, I'm causing the "too many cooks in the kitchen" problem.
[13:31:01] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[13:31:11] <gnarf> Amnesia: so yeah
[13:31:20] <gnarf> "value" on an input seems dangerous for that
[13:31:23] <Amnesia> heh
[13:31:26] <gnarf> what happens if someone overtypes it?
[13:31:38] <gnarf> and the list reloads
[13:31:45] <gnarf> does it resurrect it's old entry?
[13:31:50] <gnarf> etc
[13:32:09] <gnarf> I would probably put <tr data-date="the date"> and then just use attribute filters on it
[13:32:19] <gnarf> if "equals" is what you actually need, and not "contains"
[13:33:10] <Amnesia> hm ok
[13:33:29] <gnarf> then on $(document).on("change", ".myTable input", function(event) { $(this).closest("tr").attr("data-date", date); }); if i wanted it editable as well
[13:33:38] <gnarf> or something like that
[13:33:46] <Amnesia> I'll try and realize your solutions
[13:33:50] <Amnesia> thanks everyone!
[13:34:15] <BillCriswell> What the hell was I thinking with my last example.
[13:34:18] <BillCriswell> Can't wait to get home.
[13:34:40] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: stay strong, weekend's on its way!:D
[13:35:09] <BillCriswell> Yeah. Going to see a lot of bands haha.
[13:37:10] <BillCriswell> I'm excited to see the kind of show Outkast puts on.
[13:37:19] <duch_lunch> woah they're still a thing?
[13:37:26] <NoiseEee> they 'came back'
[13:37:45] <BillCriswell> I just want them to perform Stankonia
[13:37:46] <chinoto> gnarf: The boolean attribute thing I was talking about is for XHTML, it's also one of three ways allowed in HTML5 (though it is case insensitive). http://www.pubpixel.com/article/18/what-are-html-xhtml-boolean-attributes-and-how-do-i-use-them
[13:38:03] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: i heard theyve been opening with B.O.B.
[13:38:08] <NoiseEee> i would love to see them too
[13:38:25] <BillCriswell> That song would make the most rigid person move haha.
[13:38:56] <BillCriswell> Beck will be there too, which should be great.
[13:40:43] <NoiseEee> nice im seeing him next week at a theatre here
[13:40:57] <NoiseEee> dont like his new album so much, but hey, when he comes to town (which is rare) i'll see him
[13:41:10] <BillCriswell> Haven't heard the new album yet.
[13:41:46] <NoiseEee> pretty dopey/clone of 'sea change'
[13:42:05] <BillCriswell> Considering the event I'm seeing him at I'm imagining all Guero plus the hits.
[13:42:36] <NoiseEee> yeah i'd imagine something upbeat as well
[13:44:50] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: I hope to run into my friend who sells Jello shots at big festivals.
[13:45:09] <BillCriswell> He quit his job and just goes to festivals selling shit. Makes great money too.
[13:45:30] <duch_kazatel> that's gotta be a pretty awesome experience.
[13:45:33] <duch_kazatel> good stories, at least.
[13:46:17] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Definitely.
[13:46:37] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: http://vimeo.com/68569043 if you're curious haha
[13:46:43] <NoiseEee> is that kurt vile's bro
[13:46:49] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:47:08] <NoiseEee> ha right on. i saw him a couple weeks back too, but was kind of disappointed after waiting so long... i love his albums to death
[13:47:50] <duch_kazatel> that's awesome.
[13:48:11] <BillCriswell> I've heard a few songs here and there, never went all out with him. I am liking his old band War On Drugs though ( which is actually played in that video ).
[13:48:42] <NoiseEee> yeah i saw them a couple of months back, they were fantastic
[13:48:52] <NoiseEee> though i dont like the new record as much as the last
[13:49:33] <BillCriswell> I haven't listened to the new one yet.
[13:51:22] <BillCriswell> Paul is insane though. If I'm ever single I will definitely go to a festival and sell jello shots with him.
[13:51:55] <thebope> I'm single
[13:51:57] <thebope> can I do that?
[13:51:59] <NoiseEee> lol nice BillCriswell
[13:57:58] <blakespot> hey guys
[13:58:00] <blakespot> question
[13:58:21] <blakespot> I have this function to react to a click for an element:
[13:58:57] <blakespot> jQuery(function ($) {  $('#intMainBlock .videobutton1').click(function (e) { $('#basic-modal-content1').modal(); return false; }); });
[13:59:12] <blakespot> I am going to have 10 elements I want to do this to
[13:59:25] <blakespot> this is for videobutton1 triggering #basic-modal-content1
[13:59:36] <blakespot> I have a videobutton2 .. videobutton10
[13:59:42] <blakespot> Can I use a wildcard in that declaration?
[13:59:48] <blakespot> Or must I delcare that thing 10x?
[14:00:03] <NoiseEee> blakespot: sounds like you're using classes as data.  your element SHOULD be something like  <button class='videobutton' data-video='1'>
[14:00:20] <NoiseEee> blakespot: then you can have one listener on all button.videobutton
[14:00:33] <NoiseEee> blakespot: and in the function, grab the 'data-video' attribute and open the appropriate modal
[14:00:39] <blakespot> its an img with that class actually
[14:00:44] <NoiseEee> so s/button/image
[14:00:46] <blakespot> listener on all img.videobutton ?
[14:00:51] <NoiseEee> right
[14:01:31] <blakespot> the listener would read data-video ?
[14:01:42] <blakespot> to distinguish
[14:01:52] <NoiseEee> $('img.videobutton').on('click',function() { alert ('oh i should do something with '+this.attr("data-video")+'!!')})
[14:02:01] <NoiseEee> blakespot: exactly
[14:02:59] <blakespot> I see
[14:03:02] <blakespot> thank you
[14:03:06] <blakespot> I will restructure
[14:25:24] <hxm> hello
[14:25:44] <hxm> i have this script http://pastebin.com/VbVyiDhY and works, but I want change the class of a <li> when the ajax is done
[14:26:02] <duch_kazatel> hxm add a .done()
[14:26:09] <hxm> is not deprecated?
[14:26:17] <duch_kazatel> .done() is the preferred way to do that.
[14:26:18] <hxm> hm
[14:26:22] <duch_kazatel> success and error are deprecated.
[14:26:31] <hxm> better than .always?
[14:26:40] <hxm> what is .always for then?
[14:26:51] <duch_kazatel> .always() happens regardless of status
[14:27:33] <hxm> aha
[14:27:43] <wunz> why isn't there a .duch_kazatel() ?!
[14:27:43] <hxm> well, just changed, thanks for the tip
[14:27:50] <hxm> but still fail
[14:27:58] <wunz> you deserve a fn named after you duch_kazatel
[14:28:08] <duch_kazatel> nah, leave that for folks like shoky and gnarf.
[14:28:13] <wunz> upon calling the func, you'll magically appear and fix our codes ;p
[14:28:15] <duch_kazatel> and NoiseEee and billcriswell
[14:28:16] <wunz> or code it for us
[14:28:39] <duch_kazatel> hxm show your code?
[14:28:46] <hxm> http://pastebin.com/VbVyiDhY
[14:29:02] <duch_kazatel> i don't see the done added.
[14:29:10] <hxm> ah sorry
[14:29:16] <duch_kazatel> also, if you want to set a class, use .class().
[14:29:42] <duch_kazatel> let me show you what's up with some of this.
[14:29:58] <duch_kazatel> $("#panel li").css("cursor", "pointer"); - move to your CSS>
[14:30:20] <wunz> i need to understand js a bit better though, in things like http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache | how do you know what the params should be and what do they return? source: function( request, response ) <<
[14:30:36] <hxm> .class requires jqueryui right?
[14:30:36] <StephenS> cache I cached
[14:30:36] <StephenS> I am cached
[14:30:47] <StephenS> might be not
[14:31:04] <wunz> hxm: no? its a jq func
[14:31:17] <duch_kazatel> hxm one sec.  i'll show you.
[14:31:50] <shoky> wunz: you know by reading the API docs  http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[14:31:55] <wunz> hxm: sorry i was thinking of addclass / hasclass
[14:32:34] <wunz> shoky: makes sense, i didn't read that :) thx
[14:32:46] <blakespot> NoiseEee: Will this evaluate?
[14:32:48] <blakespot> $('#basic-modal-content-' + this.attr("data-video")).modal();
[14:33:00] <blakespot> for #basic-modal-content-1
[14:33:01] <blakespot> etc.
[14:33:12] <blakespot> with setup we discussed earlier
[14:33:31] <NoiseEee> blakespot: it should
[14:33:41] <duch_kazatel> hxm http://jsfiddle.net/9BmxY/
[14:33:45] <duch_kazatel> try this.
[14:33:57] <wunz> blakespot: it should as its the same as var a = this.attr("data-video"); $('#basic-modal-content-' + a)).modal();
[14:34:02] <blakespot> getting --- [Error] TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'this.attr("data-video")') (anonymous function) (basic.js, line 25) dispatch (jquery-1.10.2.js, line 5095) handle (jquery-1.10.2.js, line 4766)
[14:34:33] <duch_kazatel> hxm even better: http://jsfiddle.net/9BmxY/1/
[14:34:37] <blakespot> and the field on the page has that value -- <img src=".." class="videobutton" data-video="1">
[14:34:47] <NoiseEee> blakespot: you might have to $(this)
[14:36:08] <blakespot> getting same error with
[14:36:16] <blakespot> $('#basic-modal-content-' + $(this.attr("data-video"))).modal();
[14:36:17] <blakespot> hm
[14:36:46] <blakespot> full:
[14:37:00] <blakespot> $('img.videobutton').on('click',function() { $('#basic-modal-content-' + $(this.attr("data-video"))).modal(); return false; });
[14:37:24] <shoky> $(this).attr(...)
[14:37:25] <hxm> ah the updated version says no error but the alert is object Object
[14:37:45] <duch_kazatel> hxm use console.log() instead.
[14:38:00] <duch_kazatel> hxm also that call sets the class, it doesn't return it
[14:38:53] <hxm> ah the console works, I see the return, so I changed it for this $(objectName).class(className);
[14:39:05] <hxm> because I want to change the class for the new class
[14:39:19] <duch_kazatel> *addClass() and removeClass()
[14:39:24] <duch_kazatel> i misspoke earlier.
[14:39:40] <duch_kazatel> or http://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/
[14:39:51] <Es0teric> alright im back with the same problem from earlier
[14:39:52] <Es0teric> lol
[14:40:04] <decx> would it be mistyped or misthought?
[14:40:22] <duch_kazatel> probably both - yesterday and today have been pretty rough.
[14:41:10] <hxm> ah I see what happen, the class works in the source code but I dont see the change (the li should change color)
[14:41:13] <decx> weekend cant come soon enough eh
[14:42:03] <hxm> i can handle it now, duch_kazatel  your help is very appreciated, thank you so much
[14:42:42] <duch_kazatel> hxm definitely.
[14:42:54] <duch_kazatel> decx kind of.
[14:55:14] <disappearedng> How do I tell javascript to just ignore timezones? d = new Date('2014-01-01') >>> Tue Dec 31 2013 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)
[14:55:49] <Es0teric> when i use replaceWith() i can pass a dynamic div like.. .replaceWith($(‘<div/>’, {class: “someClass”}).append($(‘.something’)));
[14:55:49] <Es0teric> ?
[14:56:03] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric yes,
[14:56:14] <duch_kazatel> as long as it's valid - check out the docs.
[15:09:37] <mounir_> hi guys
[15:09:43] <mounir_> could someone save me plz
[15:09:46] <mounir_> i'm struggeling
[15:09:58] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ mounir_
[15:09:58] <b-ot> mounir_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:10:06] <mounir_> i want to use highchart.js to run in my app and display data based on month with the following snippet http://laravel.io/bin/XDPNB
[15:10:15] <mounir_> the problem is, i do get the month in the x axis but nothing render, the console.log give me the right data there
[15:10:21] <mounir_> but nothing render, only the monthnames
[15:10:31] <mounir_> if someone could help, here is a screen of my app showing monthname in the x axis http://snag.gy/kBFVR.jpg
[15:10:37] <duch_kazatel> mounir_ can you create a jsfiddle, instead?
[15:10:40] <duch_kazatel> or a bin?
[15:10:47] <mounir_> sure
[15:10:53] <mounir_> hum
[15:11:09] <mounir_> there is some php i dont think jsfiddle will like it ?
[15:11:21] <duch_kazatel> right - so make it html instead.
[15:11:25] <duch_kazatel> and javascript.
[15:11:33] <mounir_> okay
[15:11:37] <duch_kazatel> that's what the PHP puts out anyway ;)
[15:13:19] <duch_kazatel> mounir_ wait - did you check to see if there's a highcharts channel?
[15:13:59] <duch_kazatel> yeah there is one - ask in there first.
[15:19:08] <mounir_> lol very difficut to format the php to js ...
[15:30:22] <duch_kazatel> mounir_ sorry mano - did you ask the highcharts room?
[15:37:47] <mounir_> did not know there is highchart room
[15:46:02] <mounir_> is that a right jsbin to debug ? http://jsbin.com/recowuji/1/edit
[15:46:12] <mounir_> i did my best to provide something to debug lol
[15:46:32] <mounir_> first time using jsbin to highlight my bad code
[15:47:06] <duch_kazatel> can you fix the syntax errors?
[15:47:51] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/recowuji/2/edit
[15:48:09] <duch_kazatel> there - you were using [] around that object - shoulda been {}
[15:48:58] <duch_kazatel> okay, so what was the specific problem?
[15:49:09] <mounir_> hah sorry :)
[15:49:20] <mounir_> ok , the problem is, it's not rendering the data
[15:50:02] <mounir_> as you see it display the monthname but nothing else,
[15:50:37] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[15:52:25] <duch_kazatel> and you looked at the examples page they have?
[15:53:39] <mounir_> yup, and i dont get it where i missread
[15:59:25] <duch_kazatel> reread the docs ;)
[16:00:03] <duch_kazatel> http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#Chart.series
[16:00:14] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Lgc8b/2/
[16:00:22] <duch_kazatel> your data should be an array
[16:00:43] <mounir_> owwwww
[16:00:50] <mounir_> you're da boss duch_kazatel :)
[16:00:53] <mounir_> a true boss :)
[16:00:55] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:42:30] <terrrs> hey i'm having trouble understanding how callbacks work with javascript https://www.firebase.com/docs/javascript/datasnapshot/index.html
[16:42:38] <terrrs> can someone please clarify for me, i just don't "get it"
[16:42:48] <duch_kazatel> terrrs easy.
[16:42:49] <terrrs> specifically how datasnapshot gets data
[16:43:06] <terrrs> like, to me, it seems like it passes empty data.. yet isnetad it fills up
[16:43:25] <duch_kazatel> let's make a super basic example WITHOUT datasnapshop - that OK?
[16:43:32] <terrrs> ok
[16:44:33] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Pex39/
[16:44:39] <duch_kazatel> here's an extremely basic example.
[16:45:25] <duch_kazatel> in this example, we're using .on() to bind an event listener - this listens for the event an executes a callback - it "calls back" to a function.
[16:45:58] <terrrs> ok..
[16:46:11] <duch_kazatel> you may have seen cases like this before: http://jsfiddle.net/Pex39/1/
[16:46:31] <terrrs> maybe its not callback i don't understand, but how dataSnapshot gets any data..
[16:46:50] <duch_kazatel> what part in particular, terrs?
[16:46:56] <duch_kazatel> rather, terrrs
[16:47:12] <terrrs> like, its passed as argument in callback, but what gives it data
[16:47:17] <duch_kazatel> what is?
[16:47:21] <terrrs> dataSnapshot
[16:47:23] <duch_kazatel> you mean when you do var fredRef = new Firebase('https://SampleChat.firebaseIO-demo.com/users/fred'); ?
[16:47:32] <terrrs> yeah
[16:47:40] <terrrs> fredRef.once('value', function(dataSnapshot) {
[16:47:48] <duch_kazatel> which one?  the one you pasted?
[16:47:50] <terrrs> yeah
[16:48:36] <duch_kazatel> under the hood, the fredRef object has a method called .once() on it.  that function's definition allows you to pass an object to the callback.
[16:49:04] <duch_kazatel> check out this example: http://jsfiddle.net/Pex39/3/
[16:49:13] <duch_kazatel> see how I'm passing "e" to that callback?
[16:49:27] <terrrs> so, i pass a function, and it autmoaticaly fills the first argument no matter the name?
[16:49:57] <duch_kazatel> correct.  in some cases (like with my .on()), the argument is optional.
[16:50:11] <duch_kazatel> you're simply giving it a name.
[16:50:14] <duch_kazatel> you can call it anything.
[16:50:36] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Pex39/4/ - see how both of these return the same thing?
[16:51:50] <terrrs> ic.. is this how everything is done.. with functions attached to callbacks?
[16:52:32] <terrrs> where would i read more about this, it seems very fundamental but conceputally new to me
[16:52:57] <terrrs> is it javascript or jquery?
[16:55:53] <duch_kazatel> callbacks are javascript.
[16:56:37] <duch_kazatel> you're probably overcomplicating things.
[16:56:44] <duch_kazatel> a callback is simply a function you "call back" to.
[16:57:03] <duch_kazatel> the optional arg bit is a common jquery pattern
[16:58:03] <terrrs> so, does every event listern assign a value to the callback function's argument
[16:58:26] <duch_kazatel> you mean in .on()
[16:58:32] <duch_kazatel> right?
[16:58:36] <terrrs> i dont know, in general
[16:58:44] <terrrs> like .onclick etc
[16:58:51] <duch_kazatel> .on() is how you do event listeners in javascript.
[16:58:57] <duch_kazatel> *jquery
[16:59:00] <duch_kazatel> not javascript sorry
[16:59:42] <terrrs> and if i had function( variable) in callback it will always assign a value to "variable"
[17:00:14] <duch_kazatel> not in all callback.
[17:00:19] <duch_kazatel> only those that accept arguments.
[17:00:28] <terrrs> i see
[17:00:49] <terrrs> ok thanks thats helped a lot, i think i have a good general idea of how it works
[17:09:44] <terrrs> you know on https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#session/dy0jtwjfes0, it basically loops through all the data with displayChatMessage, but it seems like it should only display once... like there is no while loop or anything
[17:12:27] <duch_kazatel> which one?
[17:12:59] <duch_kazatel> ah - it runs displayChatMessage for each on?
[17:13:02] <duch_kazatel> *one
[17:13:15] <terrrs> yes.. like displays the whole chat log
[17:13:31] <duch_kazatel> right - myDataRef.on('child_added', function(snapshot) { is what does that
[17:13:31] <terrrs> loops though every name and text pair
[17:13:47] <duch_kazatel> it's not looping - something it triggering that event.
[17:13:50] <duch_kazatel> *is
[17:14:05] <terrrs> it loads all messages when i have them saved and start webpage
[17:14:29] <terrrs> so if i have 10 saved messages, it loads all 10
[17:14:34] <terrrs> right hwen opening web page
[17:14:47] <duch_kazatel> right.  and every time one is added, it's triggering the child_added event
[17:14:56] <duch_kazatel> that event calls back to displayChatMessage()
[17:16:51] <terrrs> so it starts from zero when i start page and loops through all children?
[17:16:56] <terrrs> so.. not really a dom listener
[17:17:13] <duch_kazatel> it's not looping anything.
[17:18:00] <duch_kazatel> it's likely running logic in the background that runs child_added for each one, or there's some other initialization logic.
[17:18:25] <terrrs> ic ok
[17:18:53] <duch_kazatel> yeah - the first one - add an alert() in that .on() handler.
[17:19:02] <duch_kazatel> you'll see it run once for each message.
[17:21:15] <terrrs> 5 min tutorial = 50 min tutorial for me -_-
[17:21:46] <duch_kazatel> have you done much work with pure js or jquery?
[17:22:11] <terrrs> i have applied jquery libraries for effects
[17:22:12] <terrrs> thats about it
[17:22:18] <duch_kazatel> that's why it's taking so long.
[17:22:31] <terrrs> and i did those codeacademy tutorial series
[17:22:36] <terrrs> guess it didn't stick :(
[17:22:53] <duch_kazatel> think of it this way - you're learning a library without requisite knowledge.,  for every little thing, you have to look up the jquery bits, and sometimes the javascript bits.
[17:23:18] <terrrs> this firebase thing is reall cool though, nice to get stuff working right off the bat and growing from there
[17:23:39] <terrrs> instead of many hours to get the  most basic setup
[17:24:03] <duch_kazatel> what does this do, exactly?
[17:24:17] <terrrs> its like a chat room
[17:24:22] <terrrs> you enter name and text
[17:24:26] <duch_kazatel> okay
[17:24:27] <terrrs> and it just keeps showing them
[17:24:54] <duch_kazatel> i get that part - what does the library actually offer?  or is it a glorified chat system?
[17:25:24] <terrrs> oh firebase, it like manages your database for angular
[17:25:40] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you really need to take a step back and learn more basics firsrt.
[17:26:20] <terrrs> what would you recommend i read?

[18:04:07] <crocket> $.parseXML fails with IE8 and jquery 1.11
[18:04:17] <yessir> $('<div/>').text(text).prepend($('<em/>').text(name+': ')).appendTo($('#messagesDiv'));  how does it work that the opening <div> are included when I just see </div>
[18:04:34] <yessir> is there some automatic feature here?
[18:06:08] <Poultra> ok me?
[18:06:12] <__joshua___> <div/> is shorthand for <div></div> in the html builder thingy
[18:06:31] <jaspertheghost> anyone have a css display table example of displaying form elements in the style      <td alsign=left>label</td><td align=left><input type=text></td>
[18:07:12] <yessir> oh wow I didnt' even notice its div/ isntead of /div
[18:07:17] <yessir> cool thanks
[18:08:42] <Poultra> me?
[18:11:01] <Poultra> so
[18:11:11] <Poultra> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq4oB-6FNp8
[18:11:19] <Poultra> beat it

[18:39:58] <hExDJ> hi
[19:00:21] <crocket> $.parseXML fails to parse dtd11 XML files on IE8.
[19:00:31] <crocket> Is there a better XML parser that works on IE8?
[19:03:10] <crocket> Can I make jquery 1.11 to directly parse XML?
[19:03:15] <crocket> Can I make jquery 1.11 directly parse XML?
[19:03:41] <sacho> "directly"?
[19:15:46] <wa5ted> what is this directly
[19:15:55] <wa5ted> what is this directly crocket
[19:15:57] <wa5ted> what is this directly crocket
[19:15:59] <wa5ted> what is this directly
[19:16:01] <wa5ted> what is this directly crocket
[19:16:02] <wa5ted> what is this directly crocket
[19:16:03] <wa5ted> what is this directly crocket
[19:28:02] <crocket> wa5ted, man
[19:28:05] <crocket> wa5ted, Don't repeat.
[19:28:28] <crocket> Can jQuery work on an XML document string directly?
[19:28:32] <wa5ted> crocket: practice what you preach then
[19:28:43] <crocket> It seems to do so.
[19:29:29] <sacho> what does "work on an xml document string directly" mean
[19:29:31] <crocket> Man
[19:30:17] <crocket> sacho, var xmlString = "<?xml blahblah..."; $(xmlString).find("a > b > c");
[19:30:23] <shoky> crocket: no it can't. jquery isn't an xml parsing library
[19:30:44] <sacho> crocket, that will parse the string into a dom tree as if it was html.
[19:30:47] <__joshua___> yeah, you can use the browsers xml parser and query it with jquery, but you probably can't due to the dtd
[19:34:10] <crocket> sacho : It's basically XHTML.
[19:34:37] <crocket> IE8's XML parser fails to parse dtd11 documents.
[19:34:44] <crocket> That's where hell begins.
[19:36:40] <__joshua___> crocket:  is it critical that you support ie8/have ie8 parse these docs?  (not a helpful question, just curious)
[19:37:04] <crocket> __joshua___, could be
[19:39:17] <shoky> what's dtd11
[21:25:58] <didit> hey, i'm looking at jquery mobile, i don't see any instructions of how to apply the list styles, only their samples, any help? http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/docs/lists/lists-divider.html
[21:26:11] <didit> am i missing something ~~
[22:21:26] <didit> $('<div/>').prepend($('<li/>')).text(name+': ') why is this deleting my <li/> from content
[22:22:49] <didit> instead of <div><li>name... I get <div>name..
[22:25:37] <didit> :((
[22:27:43] <systemfault> didit: Try to decompose that line...
[22:28:05] <didit> i'm not smart enough to.. i just copy pasted from sample...
[22:28:33] <systemfault> You should think about learning… instead of just pasting crap.
[22:28:41] <didit> i am trying to learn
[22:28:44] <didit> hard to find search results
[22:28:59] <didit> google doesn't search these queries easily
[22:29:12] <systemfault> didit: Basically, the <li> is prepended but .text(text) kills all the nodes inside the <div>
[22:29:20] <systemfault> Also… <li> is invalid inside a <div>...
[22:29:32] <systemfault> <li>s can only exist inside a <ul> or a <ol>
[22:29:41] <didit> does .text always scale up to next div?
[22:29:46] <didit> i did not read this in text document
[22:30:08] <didit> and li... sorry :(
[22:30:54] <systemfault> didit: .text replaces everything inside a node with the provided text content.
[22:31:01] <systemfault> It “kills” what’s already existing.
[22:31:35] <didit> ok, quick question, when there are a series of modifiers, it is left to right correct?
[22:32:03] <didit> so why woudln't .text be applied to <div><li></li></div>
[22:32:09] <didit> why would this kill <div>?
[22:32:18] <didit> er, kill li
[22:32:29] <systemfault> because the text() is applied to the <div>
[22:32:46] <systemfault> .prepend returns the div, not the created li.
[22:33:06] <systemfault> But seriously.. using invalid markups makes you look dumb… fix it.
[22:33:11] <systemfault> (markup)
[22:33:27] <systemfault> A <li> cannot exists as a direct child of a <div>
[22:34:26] <didit> i see, prepend returns div.. now i see why i didn't read this in .text
[22:34:37] <systemfault> Great.
[22:37:36] <didit> what does the $() around a selector do?
[22:38:01] <systemfault> didit: Selects a set of elements in the DOM.
[22:38:38] <didit> ok, i will search that and study
[22:38:48] <didit> also, when you have a bunch of appends/prepends in a row, what is taht called?
[22:38:53] <systemfault> $('.lol') selects all elements with a class="lol" in the document
[22:39:03] <systemfault> didit: Bad code.
[22:39:20] <didit> well.. its part of a tutorial -_-
[22:39:48] <didit> wouldnt ('.lol') select every class="lol" too though?
[22:40:15] <systemfault> No, selecting elements is not the same as appending/prepending.
[22:40:35] <systemfault> didit: Everytime you add an element in the document, you're causing a "reflow" which is slow. So, if you need to add a lot of elements to the DOM, try to batch add them
[22:41:06] <didit> batch add...
[22:41:23] <didit> lots of things to study ~~
[22:41:50] <systemfault> didit: You can do that by appending the HTML to be added to a string... and then at the end of the loop, add the generated string to the DOM.
[22:41:56] <systemfault> It will cause a single reflow.
[22:42:14] <systemfault> Yeah, being good at JS takes time.
[22:43:10] <didit> ok thanks for help system
[22:43:29] <didit> help sjust to know temrs i need to research
[22:44:23] <systemfault> didit: knowing your CSS selectors well is also going to help you immensely with jQuery (Selecting nodes)
[23:47:42] <porjo> I'm trying to get scrollHeight of child element. I do element.find(".child-class") but when I inspect the returned object I cannot see any property 'scrollHeight' !?
