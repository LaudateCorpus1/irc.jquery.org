[00:13:10] <Gorakhpuriya> Hi, Would you please let me know how can I make a slide dragble in the slider?
[00:14:16] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: by your expression i suspect your not talking about slider but a slideshow plugin?
[00:14:42] <Cork> or are you having problems getting the handles to move in the slider?
[00:17:15] <Gorakhpuriya> yes
[00:20:53] <Gorakhpuriya> I want to change the prev and next slider though the mouse drag? Are you getting my point
[00:21:33] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: simplest is prob if you have an example
[00:21:46] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: or at lest you need to share what slideshow plugin your using
[00:21:57] <Gorakhpuriya> bx slider I am using
[01:18:50] <CrowX-> can I select an element by using two of its classes
[01:19:08] <CrowX-> for example, I want to select the element that is member of classA and classB
[01:19:30] <CrowX-> is this valid? $(".classA > .classB").first()
[01:19:31] <CrowX-> ?
[01:20:04] <CrowX-> nvm, I found out :)
[01:20:16] <CrowX-> it's .classA.classB without space
[01:28:39] <Cork> CrowX-: you got to love that ie<7 isn't around anymore :)
[01:29:01] <CrowX-> it is for some projects :)
[01:29:22] <Cork> CrowX-: well they can't use what you just asked about
[01:29:48] <Cork> .classname.classname doesn't work in ie6 and older
[01:30:15] <Cork> oh wait sorry
[01:30:19] <Cork> that was >
[01:30:36] <Cork> its ie5.5 and older that doesn't support compound classes
[01:32:16] <CrowX-> thanks
[01:41:51] <Uhkis> but who uses windows98 @ 2014 :-)
[01:43:41] <Cork> Uhkis: you would be surprised :)
[01:46:28] <Uhkis> i recall fixing one win98 computer back in 2006
[01:46:41] <Uhkis> but even that's almost 10 years ago
[01:47:17] <Prime2> windows 98?!
[01:47:18] <Prime2> damn
[01:47:55] <beancurd> we have a win 3.1 machine at work. running some industrial machinery
[01:48:21] <Prime2> you need a new workplace
[01:48:21] <Uhkis> is that used a lot for web surfing? :D
[01:48:54] <beancurd> Prime2: why's that? it's like a 30 year old mail sorting thing runs fine.
[01:49:20] <beancurd> but in saying that, i am leaving soon though, for reasons not related to the mail sorting machine running win3.1
[01:49:25] <beancurd> Uhkis: nope he.
[01:49:28] <beancurd> heh.
[01:49:29] <Prime2> fair enough
[01:50:55] <CrowX-> is there a way to change the background color of an element so that it slowly fades into the other color?
[01:51:10] <Prime2> yes
[01:51:12] <CrowX-> how
[01:51:15] <brunoais> CrowX-, yes
[01:51:21] <brunoais> CrowX-, CSS?
[01:51:33] <CrowX-> css/javascript, whatever
[01:52:00] <brunoais> CrowX-, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition
[01:52:07] <beancurd> http://jqueryui.com/animate/
[01:52:14] <beancurd> if you want to do it with js.
[01:52:38] <Prime2> damn that is sexy
[01:52:57] <brunoais> CrowX-, CSS way is more clean because it's the browser that is doing. With js, you may deal with incuerencies based on the browser that is doing it
[01:53:47] <brunoais> CrowX-, With transitions, just make 2 classes, 1 with a color, the other with the other, then tell it the transition time and effect and you're done
[01:54:28] <brunoais> with js you just add the new class to the element and its color will change progressively
[01:55:10] <CrowX-> brunoais, so I set -webkit-transition: and transition: to "background-color 0.5s", and then when I change the background from js, it slowly fades?
[01:56:09] <Cork> CrowX-: yup
[01:56:14] <brunoais> you don't set a transition to something. You tell that you want it to change from 2 "display" states progressively
[01:56:25] <brunoais> that's what the transition is
[01:56:32] <brunoais> when you can change the CSS however you want
[01:56:46] <CrowX-> oh, yes it works
[01:56:50] <brunoais> it will be a fluid transition from the first to the 2nd
[01:56:55] <CrowX-> cool
[01:57:04] <CrowX-> does ie9 support this?
[01:57:08] <Cork> no
[01:57:15] <Cork> ie9 is only css2
[01:57:32] <Cork> ie10 has partial support
[01:58:26] <CrowX-> wow
[01:58:33] <CrowX-> are those guys at microsoft doing any work at all?
[01:58:46] <Cork> CrowX-: they had to dig ie out of the 90's
[01:58:47] <CrowX-> or they're all just "managers"
[01:58:52] <Cork> it isn't something you do over night
[01:59:01] <CrowX-> they could've rewritten it from scratch by now
[01:59:09] <Cork> CrowX-: they basically have
[01:59:15] <Cork> ie11 is quite good
[01:59:37] <Cork> still a few bugs, but safari (or rather webkit based browsers) is the bigger problem now days
[01:59:40] <beancurd> ie6 was pretty good back when it came out.
[01:59:51] <Cork> beancurd: not really
[02:00:05] <Cork> ie4 and ie5 was revolutionizing back then
[02:00:13] <Cork> ie6 was after they stopped caring
[02:00:35] <Cork> sure a few fixes, but it wasn't by far as big an impact as ie4
[02:01:18] <Cork> basically ie4 was where ms killed netscape
[02:01:19] <beancurd> i just remember ie6 having ok css support
[02:01:28] <Cork> ie5 came while netscape was dying
[02:01:53] <Cork> and ie6 can when ms had basically been the sole browser for a while
[02:02:04] <Cork> beancurd: check no
[02:02:23] <Cork> it fixed some css selectors
[02:02:32] <beancurd> i'm probably wrong, i don't ever remember what year ie6 came out
[02:02:35] <Cork> but it lacked a long long list of selectors that was modern back then
[02:02:51] <Cork> beancurd: it came out in 2001 i think
[02:03:07] <Cork> it was installable for win2k and default in xp
[02:04:02] <beancurd> ooh xp.
[02:04:09] <Cork> August 27, 2001
[02:04:16] <Cork> was when ie6 was released
[02:04:25] <beancurd> we still have an xp machine at work.
[02:04:35] <Cork> ugg
[02:04:35] <beancurd> running some thermal printer.
[02:04:48] <Cork> beancurd: and most atms use it...
[02:04:58] <beancurd> backdoors yay.
[02:05:25] <beancurd> ok.. so who has some heroku experience.
[02:05:45] <beancurd> i've only ever deployed simple 1 page things.
[02:06:11] <beancurd> say i want to deploy a phantomjs/casperjs thing. how do i go about doing that.
[02:06:27] <beancurd> i understand there are buildpacks...
[02:07:18] <beancurd> but can i just manuallly install crap onto the thing?
[02:07:41] <Cork> beancurd: you should prob as that in a channel where it is on topic
[02:07:49] <beancurd> i probably should.
[02:13:23] <MACscr> any ideas what i might be doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/Wy386/1/
[02:15:41] <Cork> Macaveli: serialize != object

[02:16:01] <Cork> stupid bot
[02:16:20] <Cork> *MACscr:
[02:16:24] <Cork> MACscr: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[02:17:35] <Cork> MACscr: also this on a click won't work with serialize
[02:17:40] <Cork> MACscr: you should use a <form>
[02:17:44] <Cork> (and submit)
[02:18:04] <Macaveli> thanks cork :)
[02:18:05] <MACscr> well id rather not use a form
[02:18:14] <Cork> Macaveli: sorry
[02:18:26] <Cork> MACscr: why not?
[02:18:40] <Cork> if you want to serialize form elements you should use a form
[02:18:50] <Cork> if you arn't using form elements you don't need serialize
[02:18:53] <MACscr> i just want to pass a single value from a button
[02:19:03] <MACscr> and then injects some additional values
[02:19:13] <Cork> then you don't use serialize at all
[02:20:18] <Cork> Macaveli: just set the keys on the data object and send it
[02:20:36] <Macaveli> Did it and works
[02:20:40] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { type: 'post', data: { key1: val1, key2: val2 } }
[02:22:30] <Cork> MACscr: meaning http://jsfiddle.net/Wy386/3/
[02:22:51] <Cork> "v" i just took out of the air, you need to set the key name for it
[02:23:17] <Cork> uh, wait no
[02:23:25] <Cork> params doesn't support that...
[02:23:30] <MACscr> um, doesnt that just add the extra data and no value from the button?
[02:23:33] <Cork> MACscr: what is the params format you want?
[02:23:54] <Cork> MACscr: what value are you talking about?
[02:24:05] <Cork> "value"?
[02:24:10] <Cork> from the html entry?
[02:24:11] <MACscr> the value attribue
[02:24:13] <MACscr> yes
[02:24:17] <Cork> it can't be stored
[02:24:21] <Cork> as you don't have a name on it
[02:24:29] <Cork> you could set it manually though
[02:24:46] <Cork> MACscr: but your example is very broken so it is hard to figure out what you actually want to do
[02:25:46] <Cork> MACscr: taking some liberty, is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/Wy386/4/
[02:26:06] <Cork> ugg typo http://jsfiddle.net/Wy386/5/
[02:26:54] <MACscr> ah, i think thats it.
[02:28:21] <Cork> MACscr: btw you don't need to specify cache: false on post
[02:28:48] <MACscr> hmm, any ideas why i would be getting the following in console? event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.
[02:28:57] <MACscr> im using preventDefault()
[02:29:08] <Cork> MACscr: its not cause of that
[02:29:20] <Cork> jquery has a fallback test for returnValue
[02:29:33] <Cork> and the browser reacts on the existence of that
[02:29:40] <Cork> it is safe to ignore it
[02:36:26] <MACscr> Cork: i really appreciate the help. Thank you!
[02:36:27] <zitter> hi, in my appended node I want to add a "click" event. "click" must work on other node too. $(#el1").add("#el2").on("click", function(){}) doesn't work for appended node. In $(document).on("click", "#el1") I don't know how to define multilple node, because #el2 is defined in a var and $(document).on("click", "#el1,"+var) gives me syntax error. Any hint?
[02:36:36] <Cork> MACscr: yw
[02:37:17] <Cork> zitter: recommended is to add a class to those elements
[02:37:24] <Cork> zitter: and use that class in the selector
[02:37:52] <Cork> zitter: but if it is only two ids it might be worth doing $(document).on("click", "#el1, #el2", func)
[02:38:11] <Cork> but it is generally better to have a class you can give to the elements you want the effect on
[02:38:19] <Cork> then constantly modifying the js
[02:39:41] <zitter> how to add() in $(document).on("click", "#el1"), function(){}); ?
[02:40:14] <Cork> you don't
[02:40:14] <zitter> ah, ok... I understand
[02:40:31] <zitter> "is to add a class to those elements". <-- yeah, right
[02:40:36] <Cork> $(#el1").add("#el2") is better written as $(#el1, #el2")
[02:41:04] <Cork> $("#el1, #el2")
[02:41:16] <zitter> yep, but my problem is that it doens't work for appended element, so I have to use $(document).on("click", "#el1"
[02:41:39] <Cork> zitter: you kinda missing the point
[02:41:45] <zitter> and #el2 is defined in a var. But I think I can add a class to grab all those elements
[02:41:51] <Cork> zitter: what i'm pointing at is the string selector
[02:42:15] <Cork> you don't ever need to use add with selectors
[02:42:22] <zitter> ok ok
[02:42:38] <Cork> add is only useful if one or both sides is a set of dom elements
[02:42:55] <zitter> I was using add() due the node defined in a var
[02:43:10] <Cork> function(elms) { elms.add('.must-have-this-too').show() }
[02:43:25] <Cork> zitter: you can't use dom elements as selectors
[02:43:36] <Cork> so it can't be used with on(event, selector, func)
[02:44:07] <Cork> zitter: dom elements only match a specific element, and as you don't have the element it won't match :)
[02:51:40] <zyphz> Need invite for #php
[02:52:15] <Cork> zyphz: ya, but you prob want ##php
[02:52:40] <zyphz> Cork, it says ##php :Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services.
[02:52:49] <zyphz> Do I need to reg?
[02:52:52] <Cork> yes
[02:52:57] <zyphz> Ahh, thanks
[02:54:55] <Uhkis> why do these ##language channels have that extra #
[02:55:41] <Cork> Uhkis: http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#topicalchannels
[02:56:17] <Cork> basically # channel is for organizations and ## is for community
[02:56:33] <Cork> so #php would be for the ones developing php
[02:56:42] <Cork> while ##php is for the community using php
[02:56:53] <_rgn> we are jquery developers
[02:57:10] <Cork> some groups open up there channels
[03:00:07] <sqlnoob> Anybody familiar/experienced with jqwidgets? I'm trying to nest JSON data of different format to the root data.
[03:00:30] <sqlnoob> I'm working jqxtreegrid with two different types of data. Is it possible to achieve this?
[03:00:38] <Taronyu_> Can I ask a small question about the slideToggle callback?
[03:01:34] <_rgn> Taronyu_: first rule of IRC, don't ask to ask
[03:01:50] <Taronyu_> Okay ^^
[03:02:05] <Uhkis> first rule of asking on irc* ;)
[03:02:26] <Taronyu_> The default callback of slideToggle gets executed when the animation is done.
[03:02:37] <Taronyu_> But is there a way to identify if it is in or out?
[03:48:04] <alistair> hey, if I have 4 adjacent <li>, how would I detect the tallest one, then update the others to match? Would ideally update on resize!
[03:48:58] <alistair> I guess this kind of thing is why people love Flexbox right?
[03:53:00] <alistair> $('.signposts li').height(600) makes them all the right height, but how would I detect the tallest one?
[04:18:53] <decx> Math.max.apply(heights)
[04:19:24] <decx> or go through your li's and update a higher scoped variable with a new height value if it's higher than the old
[04:21:08] <alistair> hey decx, kind of half figured it out, but when I resize, the heights are fixed
[04:22:14] <decx> well do it again on resize then
[04:22:38] <alistair> how can I trigger a function when a $('.signposts li').height() is changed?
[04:25:56] <decx> you would trigger on window resize
[04:26:05] <decx> or are your li's resizable
[04:27:46] <alistair> the resize on browser width change, yes, but is that not excessive? How would I do it anyway?
[04:30:35] <alistair> I wrapped all my code in $( window ).resize(function() {//my code} but it doesn't update :9
[04:30:38] <alistair> :(
[04:32:02] <decx> well put it on a fiddle
[04:32:18] <decx> i'm not a wizard and/or medium
[04:34:30] <Uhkis> only clairvoyant
[04:43:31] <bberry> im reading the reference for .off and it keeps talking about namespaces. what exactly does it mean by that?
[04:43:58] <alistair> http://jsbin.com/fawiz/1/edit?js,console,output
[04:47:02] <decx> so yeah
[04:47:42] <decx> your maxheight will not be smaller after you already filled it so you have to start at 0 in your function, and you have to remove the height inline styles or else height won't do anything
[04:48:10] <decx> http://jsbin.com/fikamafe/1/edit
[04:48:29] <hooliogan132> hi .. does jq ui explode effect have a complete function?
[04:49:46] <alistair> so you see, it's not updating the height when you squeeze the window width
[04:49:56] <decx> well check the new link
[04:52:30] <alistair> ah yeah, nicely done
[04:52:42] <alistair> turns out you are a wizard
[04:54:01] <alistair> thanks, I'll have to study your changes and figure out what's going on
[04:54:48] <decx> i can give you a study guide
[04:55:04] <decx> i moved var maxHeight = 0; in the function and added .removeAttr('style')
[04:55:06] <decx> there
[04:55:36] <alistair> but why inside? my poor small brain
[04:56:02] <alistair> it was just to initialize it
[04:56:16] <decx> you're checking if the height of an element is bigger than maxheight and then you update maxheight
[04:56:31] <decx> but if you're resizing width the height might get smaller
[04:56:45] <decx> so you have to start with 0 everytime you init the resizeSignposts function
[04:56:50] <alistair> ok ok... give me a minute, think i understand, you need to reset it
[04:57:18] <decx> because it would still have the value from the last time the function updated it
[04:58:11] <alistair> can you explain what removeAttr('style') does?
[04:58:40] <decx> you set height
[04:59:01] <decx> that adds style="height: xxxpx" to the element
[04:59:21] <decx> when you check the elements height after that it will give back that, and not the actual changed height
[04:59:23] <seutje> so .height() will always return that unless you unset it first
[05:01:08] <alistair> at this point I would expect to see the li go back to it's auto height
[05:02:27] <alistair> works amazingly well, thanks wizard! I mean decx
[05:05:52] <alistair> Does resize() have to be on window? Why could it not go on an element such as '.signposts li'?
[05:06:24] <decx> because you're resizing the window
[05:07:28] <alistair> ok, thought I'd ask, I see
[05:09:22] <hooliogan132> hi .. does jq ui's explode effect have a complete function?
[05:10:33] <decx> it's called complete
[05:11:26] <hooliogan132> so just explode(2500).complete() { console.log('yay'); } ?
[05:13:21] <bberry> is there a 'good' way to pass data objects around to different event handlers?
[05:13:30] <bberry> right now im essentially make module globals for it :/
[05:13:45] <fattest> how do i animate this background everytime it transitions. maybe just a simple fade http://jsbin.com/kajuh/1/edit
[05:14:17] <hooliogan132> ah nm
[05:14:34] <decx> hooliogan132 no idea if promises are working on ui effects, use the callback argument .effect('explode',time,callback)
[05:15:51] <decx> if you want to fade backgrounds you have to either use multiple background css or overlay stuff
[05:16:16] <fattest> thanks
[05:17:52] <seutje> might also be interesting to preload em
[05:18:39] <dipayand> Which is the best book for beginners in JQuery?
[05:19:33] <decx> imho it's called api documentation the website
[05:19:43] <seutje> bberry: you can add data to a trigger() .on() calls, if that doesn't help, you can always attach data to elements by using $(el).data({foo: 'bar'}
[05:19:53] <seutje> `g jquery fundamentals
[05:19:54] <b-ot> seutje: jQuery Fundamentals :: A guide to the basics of jQuery → http://jqfundamentals.com/
[05:19:56] <seutje> dipayand: ^
[05:21:29] <bberry> can i do something like $("#myThing").on("click", function(){ // do stuff to `this` }.bind(myObj)); ?
[05:24:32] <bberry> nvm
[05:27:10] <seutje> bberry: nono, bind is for adding event handlers (and it's not a method on regular functions)
[05:28:02] <seutje> but like $('#foo').on('click', function() { console.log($(this).data('foo')); }).data({foo: 'bar'});
[05:28:18] <bberry> yeah
[05:28:20] <bberry> thatd work
[05:28:25] <bberry> thx :D
[05:29:07] <seutje> but if it's like that, u might as well go like $('#foo').on('click', {foo: 'bar'}, function(e) { console.log(e.data.foo); }); or something
[05:29:38] <bberry> well what i figured is that i have access to the object at the point of which im defining the click callback
[05:29:40] <seutje> the data thing is only usefull if a different part of the application needs to set data up for the handler to use
[05:29:51] <bberry> so i just use scoping to get the data i need
[05:30:02] <seutje> yeah, that'd work just fine for single instances
[05:30:04] <bberry> yeah
[05:31:20] <seutje> but like (function() { var data = {foo: 'bar'}; $('.foo').on('click', function(){ console.log(data.foo); }); })() would make all .foo click handlers spit out the same
[05:31:47] <bberry> yeah
[05:31:56] <bberry> i have it selected on a unique id
[05:32:02] <bberry> and theres only 1 click handler for it
[05:32:12] <seutje> yeah, implied single instance
[05:32:38] <bberry> its interesting. because im defining the event handler inside another event handler
[05:32:52] <seutje> ooh, that's usually a sign of bad omens
[05:32:53] <bberry> so i have to clear the prior event handlers before i make the new one
[05:33:06] <bberry> yeah. idk how else to do it :/
[05:33:14] <seutje> it's generally best to not unbind, but rather change a conditional to no longer apply
[05:33:37] <bberry> its kind of a hard question to explain with any semblance of brevity
[05:33:51] <bberry> (for my particular scenario, that is)
[05:35:35] <seutje> bberry: like say you want #bar to enable the handler for #foo: http://pastebin.com/KPDmTvmF
[05:35:47] <bberry> seutje: basically i have an array that is my main data array. there in a <select> menu that selects an item. then theres an 'edit' button that brings up an overlay that makes the items properties editable.  In the overlay, theres a 'save' button that packages up the <input>s in the overlay into an object and save the object back to the main data array
[05:36:17] <bberry> so in the `edit` button click handler, i set up the `save` click handler to save the data for the edited object
[05:36:43] <seutje> bberry: much better than the alternative http://pastebin.com/ZRa8Xw7v
[05:36:44] <bberry> Grr, my fkn office blocks pastebin for some reason. i hate this stupid firewall
[05:36:56] <seutje> oh sry, which doesn't it block?
[05:36:59] <seutje> I'll repaste
[05:37:15] <bberry> bpaste.net seeems to work
[05:37:58] <seutje> bberry: http://bpaste.net/show/2sONQQq7VN44iRyslf8e/
[05:38:20] <bberry> ah, gotcha
[05:38:52] <seutje> the check is just arbitrary, it could be changed by anything that is in the same scope, or you could stick it on the elements with the .data thing
[05:39:29] <bberry> yeah ill probably just make it the data to-be-edited
[05:39:40] <seutje> so you can just if ($(this).data('enableHandler')) { ... } or whatever
[05:39:43] <decx> the first example wouldnt be so bad if you just used one
[05:40:09] <decx> bar one click -> foo on click
[05:40:21] <bberry> yeah true
[05:40:26] <seutje> but then you click bar again and now foo's handler will fire twice
[05:40:41] <seutje> of you mean use .one() instead of .on?
[05:40:51] <decx> yes, that's why i wrote one and not on ^^
[05:41:03] <bberry> yeah thats why i was having to do .off for foo when ever you click bar
[05:41:11] <seutje> I thought you mean "if the level of nesting is only 1"
[05:41:15] <seutje> meant*
[05:41:16] <bberry> ooh never heard of .one
[05:41:30] <bberry> ill still probably use .data though
[05:41:36] <seutje> it's a convenience method that does the same as the checker thing, pretty much
[05:41:56] <bberry> ah
[05:41:56] <decx> i now use it to lazy init plugins
[05:42:00] <seutje> scopes a variable to check if it has already fired
[05:42:16] <bberry> gotcha
[05:42:17] <seutje> I use .once for that, but it's drupal specific and kinda shitty :D
[05:42:33] <seutje> basically adds a class to it as well to show it's been processed by javamascripts
[05:42:45] <decx> like $('.autocomple').one('click', function(){ $(this).autocomplete(arg) })
[05:42:52] <seutje> so the people generating the markup know what's up :D
[05:43:06] <BillCriswell> decx: Did you pick that up form those jQuery con slides?
[05:43:10] <decx> yes
[05:43:16] <decx> it's nice
[05:43:33] <decx> good morning btw ^^
[05:43:52] <BillCriswell> decx: Morning.
[05:44:30] <decx> i already ran like 5kilometers, either i need new shoes, or new legs
[05:44:49] <decx> i'm gonna go with new legs
[05:45:02] <BillCriswell> The only possible downside I can think of is that the init could add classes to the element jQuery UI would need for styling?
[05:45:38] <decx> i don't like .button() anyway
[05:46:00] <BillCriswell> decx: I ran 5 kilometers.
[05:46:03] <BillCriswell> In my entire life.
[05:47:08] <decx> lol
[05:50:25] <bberry> i want to make a paste site called pacedbin.com
[05:50:30] <bberry> takes things nice and slow
[05:51:01] <Taronyu_> We already have one, it is called pastebin.com
[05:51:04] <Taronyu_> nice and slow
[05:51:10] <bberry> lol
[05:51:16] <seutje> jsfiddle is kinda sluggish every now and then...
[05:51:20] <BillCriswell> bberry: I had to read that like 3 times. Hahaha
[05:51:25] <bberry> XD
[05:51:45] <seutje> make a lacedbin with funky rainbow colors
[05:51:49] <bberry> haha
[05:59:05] <BillCriswell> spacedbin
[05:59:20] <BillCriswell> racedbin. All ajax, no callbacks.
[06:01:51] <bberry> lol
[06:06:25] <decx> pacedbin was a good joke, now you're just killing the horse :(
[06:07:51] <BillCriswell> .... so I'm not beating him yet?
[06:07:54] <BillCriswell> So you're like me to continue?
[06:07:57] <BillCriswell> you'd*
[06:08:50] <decx> please don't, i may be german but that doesn't mean i can just sit idly by why comedy is being slaughtered
[06:08:57] <decx> while*
[06:09:10] <BillCriswell> Permission to make one more?
[06:09:31] <decx> wastebin.com for these jokes?
[06:09:43] <bberry> haha cute decx
[06:09:43] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhhhhhhh snap.
[06:09:51] <BillCriswell> jerkbin for you.
[06:09:56] <decx> :)
[06:10:07] <BillCriswell> The jerk store called, they're running out of you.
[06:10:33] <BillCriswell> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KmTTy_MM5w
[06:12:30] <decx> i have pulled the george so often, make one good joke and then just leave
[06:12:37] <decx> "THAT'S IT I'M OUT"
[06:14:23] <BillCriswell> He's awesome.
[06:14:46] <BillCriswell> I'm just now watching Curb Your Enthusiasm. I am way late to that.
[06:15:18] <decx> indeed
[06:15:31] <decx> have you watched the episode with the nazi already?
[06:15:50] <ElysiumNet> is there a way to modify the form upon submit? without having to resort to ajax
[06:16:02] <BillCriswell> I am only like... 3/4 of season one in.
[06:16:48] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: You can do like... $('form').on('submit', function () { $('input[name=name]').val('Bob'); });
[06:17:03] <decx> ah, yeah the skinhead episode is s6 so a long way to go
[06:17:23] <BillCriswell> Maybe I'll jump ahead and check it out tonight.
[06:17:54] <ElysiumNet> BillCriswell: not quite. I was looking more for modifying the data before sending since I ended up with a bunch of extra fields that I don't want to get sent
[06:19:00] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: You can remove the inputs on submit.
[06:19:10] <decx> is was pleasently surprised when leon had his own show on gta5 radio
[06:19:24] <ElysiumNet> BillCriswell: unfortunately that will cause issues when hitting the back button
[06:19:54] <BillCriswell> decx: I haven't met him yet. =(
[06:20:11] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: How about removing the inputs on load?
[06:20:27] <BillCriswell> Maybe I'm not following right.
[06:20:29] <BillCriswell> Tapping out.
[06:20:54] <decx> shit that's right, i totally forgot what curb was like before leon
[06:23:29] <decx> if you're into awkward comedy you should check out the uks peep show, that's brilliant
[06:23:50] <BillCriswell> Netflix always recommends that to me. Maybe I'll give it a shot.
[06:46:00] <bberry> do elements in a .each give a jquery element or a regular javascript element
[06:46:20] <decx> this in the each function is native
[06:46:41] <bberry> what if im doing like $(".myClass").each(function(i,e){
[06:46:46] <bberry> and do stuff with 'e'
[06:46:59] <bberry> is 'e' native?
[06:47:42] <decx> e is this
[06:47:46] <bberry> kk
[06:48:13] <bberry> wasnt sure if e was jquery object and this was native or if they were the same
[06:48:22] <bberry> thanks :D
[06:48:31] <onla> I want to put a clickable link to append new item below item that I append but it doesn't work this way: http://jsfiddle.net/38YXY/  .. the static link on top works, but not one that is appended
[06:49:44] <hcker2000> so lets say I have no root element and several dives at the top level. I'm trying to use .html() but for some reason I only get one of the divs out of that
[06:50:18] <hcker2000> basically I have an html fragment that is valid. I want to find a button in said fragment and then output the altered html.
[06:50:55] <BillCriswell> onla: http://jsfiddle.net/38YXY/1/
[06:51:13] <decx> g0tta go through the divs with each or a for loop hcker2000
[06:51:54] <onla> BillCriswell: oh cool tks
[06:52:26] <hcker2000> decx, would it be easier to just wrap the whole thing in a root node?
[06:52:38] <hcker2000> seems like it would be
[06:52:49] <decx> shouldnt matter
[06:53:25] <decx> html only gives back the html of the first hit in a collection
[06:53:29] <decx> like attr
[06:54:52] <hcker2000> ok this gives me some stuff to try thanks
[07:16:57] <drej> NoiseEee_ http://onemethod.com/asdgj
[07:16:59] <drej> check out those 404 pages
[07:17:02] <drej> refresh a few times
[07:17:58] <decx> white text on partially bright bgs :(
[07:19:33] <bberry> why is this not appending the element? var elm = $('<' + e.tag + '>', e.attr);
[07:19:35] <bberry> oops!@
[07:19:41] <bberry> this one http://jsfiddle.net/g2hj3/
[07:20:33] <bberry> (my main goal is to figure out how to attach data using the attributes object)
[07:21:35] <shoky> bberry: it's appending the element fine
[07:21:37] <decx> you did
[07:21:44] <bberry> nevermind
[07:21:46] <bberry> im an idiot.
[07:21:54] <decx> console.log($('.mydiv').data('foo')) returns bar
[07:22:08] <decx> but data isnt attached as a data-attribute on the element if that's what you mean
[07:22:10] <bberry> (my problem was i was doing #mydiv in the css and not .mydiv)
[07:22:15] <BillCriswell> bberry: Careful with { class: "foo" }
[07:22:36] <bberry> BillCriswell :/ whys that?
[07:22:58] <BillCriswell> I believe old IE will take your first born.
[07:23:02] <bberry> haha
[07:23:12] <BillCriswell> bberry: { "class": "foo" } is ok, though.
[07:23:24] <bberry> ah gotcha
[07:23:53] <BillCriswell> Is there a good reason templating isn't build into jQuery?
[07:23:59] <BillCriswell> built*
[07:24:33] <bberry> i made my own little templater
[07:25:01] <bberry> http://bpaste.net/show/fT2ikacGY0kd3esDajNS/
[07:25:34] <BillCriswell> Holy shit that's called spacepaste decx.
[07:25:35] <bberry> it works for my needs. probably not public-worthy though
[07:26:18] <BillCriswell> bberry: I meant more like: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[07:36:58] <bberry> ah
[07:37:02] <bberry> yeah mines more like a parser
[07:37:06] <bberry> than templating
[07:38:20] <decx> man, i'm bored today
[07:38:23] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/mfpqY/
[07:39:05] <bberry> nice
[07:39:41] <decx> thanks, i don't think the perspective on the parallax is right but i'm not bored enough for math :>
[07:40:32] <brunoais> decx, is that what you do when you are bored? I'd like to see when you are excited
[07:40:50] <decx> mostly drugs
[07:43:18] <BillCriswell> decx: Were you inspired by the opening to dinosaurs
[07:43:23] <BillCriswell> Dinosaurs*?
[07:44:28] <BillCriswell> decx: Also, if you feel like wasting the rest of your day: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock
[07:45:05] <decx> i'm trying to get into d3 anyway so that's good
[07:45:54] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/behohoho/1/edit weeee
[07:46:06] <decx> no idea what i thought when i made the background that was like 6 years ago, but i found the assets today and thought fuck it :>
[07:46:39] <decx> hmm. that looks like it might be useful
[07:46:50] <BillCriswell> decx: My biggest deterrent from trying to build something like that is the assets.
[07:47:04] <BillCriswell> Google image search is always a weird experience.
[07:47:10] <decx> i have a client that sells steampunk accessoires and i wanted to do something interesting
[07:47:20] <BillCriswell> decx: Ah, perfect.
[07:47:45] <decx> i rendered like 50 clockworks but it's just not good enough for screen&mobile
[07:47:56] <decx> *now loading 10mb of assets* doesnt fly on mobile
[07:48:12] <BillCriswell> Haha
[07:48:13] <paulvd> hello, am trying to make these equal widths, but it doesnt happen for the 3rd div ? http://jsfiddle.net/b3t78/1/
[07:48:33] <BillCriswell> Honest, this shit makes me feel so stupid.
[07:49:19] <BillCriswell> paulvd: You can't use duplicate ids.
[07:49:22] <BillCriswell> Use a class.
[07:50:54] <paulvd> thanks BillCriswell
[07:50:59] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/b3t78/2/
[07:51:03] <BillCriswell> paulvd: ^^
[07:51:04] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:53:06] <BillCriswell> paulvd: Noticed I used outerWidth() instead of .width() as well.
[07:53:22] <BillCriswell> Not sure it actually matters here?
[07:53:34] <BillCriswell> Eh whatever, it works.
[07:53:38] <paulvd> yep, but the div i am targetting in real, does not have padding or margin
[07:55:51] <anli__> Is there an ajax timeout for a call to $.post ?
[07:56:31] <BillCriswell> anli__: It's whatever the default for $.ajax would be I believe.
[07:57:28] <brunoais> andrew9183, $.post uses $.ajax internally
[07:58:03] <anli__> If I use $.post(url, data, success).fail(failure);, can I be sure either success or failure is called?
[07:58:45] <BillCriswell> anli__: You'd be better off doing $.post(url, data).always(function() { }); if you ddefinitely want something called.
[07:59:54] <andrew9183> brunoais: oh
[08:01:08] <sarachipps> hey all, are there rooms for the specific applications
[08:01:53] <sarachipps> n/m found it
[08:01:59] <anli__> BillCriswell: So there is an always function? Why would not either success or failure be called?
[08:02:14] <anli__> What is there beside those
[08:03:30] <BillCriswell> anli__: That's when either happens. I may have misunderstood your situation. done() or fail() should always happen.
[08:04:20] <anli__> I have problems when a user is posting a lot of data from a mobile device, I am not sure any of done or fail is called then
[08:04:45] <anli__> I do not use a method called .done, but I assume thats the same as $.post(url, data, done);
[08:05:37] <BillCriswell> anli__: Yes.
[08:22:43] <decx> oh no, 2&1/2 men didnt get renewed, what will i watch now when i wake up to early on a friday and want to fall asleep again :(
[08:22:58] <decx> good thing there's still plenty of chuck lorre crap to fall back on
[08:23:04] <BillCriswell> decx: I thought you liked comedy?
[08:23:27] <decx> well i am german, but that doesnt mean i go to the bottom of the barrel
[08:24:01] <BillCriswell> There's lower than 2 & 1/2 Men?
[08:24:19] <decx> the most successful comedien in germany is mario barth, and he makes carlos mencia look clever
[08:25:21] <BillCriswell> That's scary.
[08:43:05] <Jacta> Can filter return the number in index somehow? if I have 3 items in my array and runs filter on them to find one - that one that I find - i want that ones index in array?
[08:43:38] <zuloyd> hi
[08:43:57] <decx> Jacta collection.index(this)
[08:44:22] <zuloyd> I have a weird problem with jquery 1.11. When calling $(someObject).css("visibility", "hidden"), it doesn't just set the css attribute but it removes the object from the DOM
[08:44:35] <zuloyd> is that normal?
[08:44:43] <zuloyd> the same happens with $(...).hide();
[08:44:44] <Jacta> decx, mh, how is that used?
[08:44:49] <tase> whats the difference between $.ajax().done and $ajax().fail, is done = 200 status and fail = everything else, or is there an other criteria ?
[08:45:09] <BillCriswell> zuloyd: That sound wrong.
[08:49:17] <shoky> tase: 2xx and 304 are success. also things like invalid json could trigger fail
[08:49:18] <decx> cant tell without context Jacta fiddle me
[08:49:36] <duch_kazatel> awwww shiiit.
[08:49:38] <decx> pretend it's sunday and i'm the choirboy
[08:50:28] <decx> good morning duch
[08:50:37] <duch_kazatel> how goes decx?
[08:50:57] <decx> i'm wating for a designer to send me a psd to finish a page i planned for today
[08:51:06] <duch_kazatel> that's always fun.
[08:51:08] <decx> so i'm mostly just bored
[08:51:12] <decx> *compiling*
[08:51:28] <decx> this bored actually: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/mfpqY/
[08:52:06] <duch_kazatel> woah
[08:52:08] <decx> fuck it, i'm going to write an ai for the birds
[08:52:24] <BillCriswell> It better have a barrel roll method.
[08:52:32] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[08:52:33] <BillCriswell> Otherwise you're wasting your god damn time.
[08:52:48] <decx> if mousecursor close, change direction
[08:52:58] <decx> there, more realistic than the fish in cod ghosts
[08:53:20] <BillCriswell> Would you say the cods in cod?
[08:53:31] <BillCriswell> A cod is a fish right?
[08:53:34] <duch_kazatel> yes
[08:53:37] <duch_kazatel> ++
[08:53:37] <BillCriswell> I might have read that in a book.
[08:53:40] <duch_kazatel> you're on fire today
[08:53:54] <decx> should've been here earlier
[08:53:56] <BillCriswell> decx disagrees
[08:53:59] <BillCriswell> hhahaha I know it.
[08:54:37] <decx> time to read through the logs !
[08:54:59] <BillCriswell> It was fun names for paste bins type jokes.
[08:55:08] <BillCriswell> Mine were hilarious decx just doesn't like funny.
[08:55:38] <decx> pacedbin.com for a slow paste service was nice
[08:55:47] <duch_kazatel> ++
[08:55:53] <decx> as was: but that's pastebin.com
[08:56:01] <decx> then it just deteriorated :>
[08:56:18] <BillCriswell> racebin would be one built on ajax without any callbacks.
[08:56:48] <decx> nerd
[08:56:51] <decx> ^^
[08:57:00] <BillCriswell> spacebin the code slowly floats off the page.
[08:57:04] <BillCriswell> I could go all day decx.
[08:57:12] <duch_kazatel> tracebin just shows you an outline of the code.
[08:57:23] <decx> i hate to repeat myself, but wastebin.com for all the failed jokes is just too good :(
[08:57:35] <duch_kazatel> lacebin for when you're feeling girly.
[08:57:37] <BillCriswell> decx: I agree.
[08:57:41] <BillCriswell> bin is jut a good word.
[08:57:59] <duch_kazatel> tastebin for recipes
[08:58:19] <BillCriswell> I wonder how the term "pastebin" got so popular.
[08:58:25] <BillCriswell> Is there some old computery stuff I don't know about?
[08:59:12] <decx> where does paste come from anyway
[08:59:22] <duch_kazatel> !g online code paste
[08:59:23] <duch_b0t> duch_kazatel: Pastebin.com - #1 paste tool since 2002! <http://pastebin.com/>
[08:59:23] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Pastebin.com - #1 paste tool since 2002! → http://pastebin.com/
[08:59:31] <decx> and what's it got to do with pasta
[08:59:34] <duch_kazatel> woops.  killing my bot.
[09:00:56] <decx> pastebin was probably the thing on your table where you collect everything you cut out somewhere
[09:01:05] <decx> ready to be pasted into another paper or whatever
[09:02:14] <bberry> if i wanted to have a text string that has a variable amount of newlines in it, is there a way for me to just make a string with \n's in it, or do i have to create new <span>s and put <br>s in between?
[09:03:48] <bberry> i have a bunch of input fields, and i want to have a warning message detailing all the input errors.  So i have a loop that goes through all the fields and validates them. if theyre bad, i append the warning to a string variable.  then i change the .text of a span to that string variable.
[09:04:38] <decx> validation is such a minefield that i always rely on jq validate
[09:07:06] <anli__> jquery validate is always troubling us
[09:08:11] <bberry> lol my validation works well enough. my question is more about the string :/
[09:09:29] <duch_kazatel> I actually just wrote my own validator
[09:10:58] <duch_kazatel> bberry so you're trying to figure out how to build up your error message display?
[09:11:04] <bberry> yeah
[09:11:17] <duch_kazatel> don't rely on newlines - put in <br>s
[09:11:19] <bberry> what ill probably do is just change the .html of the <span> and have <br/> tags at the end of each message
[09:11:20] <bberry> yeah
[09:13:33] <ElysiumNet> duch_kazatel: or use the proper element?
[09:14:03] <ElysiumNet> if it's a list of errors... use a list?
[09:14:12] <duch_kazatel> ElysiumNet sure - the other way to do it is to build out a list and hide/show the appropriate ones.
[09:14:25] <duch_kazatel> but i don't know what he has built out in this case :)
[09:17:22] <bberry> yeah i considered using a list as well
[09:17:41] <duch_kazatel> that might be the better choice - depending on how you're displaying things.
[09:18:28] <bberry> yeah, itd be kind of awkward looking with just 1 item
[09:18:53] <duch_kazatel> not really.  if you style it appropriately, the container should grow and shrink to fit the content.
[09:19:16] <bberry> theres like a little icon and an "Alert!" text in front. so if i used a list after that, then the list would start underneath the 'Alert!' text
[09:19:28] <bberry> where as if theres just 1 item, itd be better if it was to the right of the alert
[09:19:36] <bberry> i could just place my list differently i guess
[09:19:41] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[09:19:47] <phelix> is nan the same thing as undefined?
[09:19:50] <duch_kazatel> no.
[09:19:53] <bberry> phelix nop
[09:20:01] <duch_kazatel> NaN is a numeric value that means "Not a Number".
[09:20:11] <duch_kazatel> undefined means, well, undefined.
[09:20:42] <phelix> ohh ok. Could I do like if if(EmpName == 'NaN'){ //DO SOMETHING } ?
[09:21:00] <bberry> hmm. NaN checking is tricky
[09:21:03] <bberry> iirc
[09:21:07] <duch_kazatel> phelix not really.
[09:21:12] <duch_kazatel> phelix what are you trying to do?
[09:21:12] <bberry> i think theres a jquery isNaN function though
[09:21:22] <duch_kazatel> also NaN and 'NaN' are distinct ;)
[09:21:28] <phelix> Well on some of those sliders it seems that until the slider has been moved the value is NAN
[09:21:36] <phelix> I need the value to be default of 0 not NaN
[09:21:43] <duch_kazatel> init the slider at 0 then.
[09:21:48] <phelix> ahh ok
[09:21:51] <bberry> >.<
[09:21:55] <bberry> the xy is real
[09:21:58] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:23:04] <bberry> do those sliders have text inputs tied to them?
[09:23:15] <bberry> or is that an options
[09:23:18] <bberry> option*
[09:23:28] <duch_kazatel> and for the record... jsfiddle.net/STXL5/1/
[09:23:35] <duch_kazatel> NaN isn't even equal to itself.
[09:24:30] <duch_kazatel> and my favorite part about NaN is that it's not even a javascript oddity - that's IEEE all the way.
[09:25:29] <bberry> yeah
[09:25:32] <bberry> <3 ieee754
[09:27:11] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, that's because NaN is not a number :3
[09:27:24] <Jattenalle> can't compare it to anything, because it's just.. broken
[09:27:29] <duch_kazatel> yep
[09:27:29] <anli__> And a number is Not a NaN...
[09:27:38] <Jattenalle> anli__, we must go deeper!
[09:27:41] <anli__> :)
[09:27:47] <duch_kazatel> but typeof NaN === number
[09:28:05] <bberry> NaN + [] = "NaN"
[09:28:06] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, yeah, because the type of it is a number, as opposed to a string
[09:28:07] <anli__> I stay away from NaN:s, they are misimplemented in vs
[09:28:09] <Jattenalle> it's just not.. A number
[09:28:17] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle yep.
[09:28:20] <Jattenalle> i do love though, that JS has isNaN()
[09:28:21] <duch_kazatel> very familiar
[09:28:24] <bberry> er, NaN + [] === "NaN"
[09:28:25] <Jattenalle> which is just so horribly missleading
[09:29:08] <Jattenalle> isNaN() == !isNumeric()
[09:29:14] <Jattenalle> doesnt actually check for NaN
[09:29:19] <anli__> Can you add something to an array?
[09:29:24] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:29:28] <duch_kazatel> array.push();
[09:29:29] <Jattenalle> anli__, yes?
[09:29:42] <bberry> couldnt you determine if something is NaN just by doing bitmasking
[09:29:47] <anli__> I always use .push, did not know about +:ing
[09:29:53] <duch_kazatel> wait what?
[09:29:58] <duch_kazatel> +:ing?
[09:30:16] <anli__> duch_kazatel: arr + foo
[09:30:28] <Jattenalle> bberry, you "can", but when NaN is encountered the behaviour is undefined, just like / 0..
[09:30:31] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't do what you think it does.
[09:30:38] <anli__> oh, ok
[09:30:44] <anli__> Then its a good thing I never used it
[09:30:53] <bberry> Jattenalle ah right
[09:31:05] <bberry> yeah, the +
[09:31:11] <bberry> sign in js is cray cray
[09:31:12] <Jattenalle> i've taken to just using objects for my arrays, might not be the most efficient, but damn if it isnt nice to just be able to thing[whatever] = stuff;
[09:31:16] <codecowboy> can you put a data attribute on an image tag? I can't get jquery ui tooltips to recognise my data attribute
[09:31:20] <duch_kazatel> anli__ adding something to it coerces both sides to a string: http://jsfiddle.net/XcLWJ/
[09:31:31] <duch_kazatel> codecowboy you sure can.
[09:31:35] <bberry> Jattenalle: do you have a .length on it?
[09:31:39] <anli__> duch_kazatel: Ah, ok, so I will never find a use for it then
[09:31:40] <duch_kazatel> "objects for my arrays"?
[09:31:47] <duch_kazatel> arrays ARE objects.  just special ones.
[09:32:10] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, yeah, what i mean is using actual objects.. so you dont have to use .push etc.. slower, but i find the code more readable
[09:32:10] <anli__> assoc arrays are objects that not arrays...
[09:32:16] <anli__> :)
[09:32:26] <duch_kazatel> anli__ JS doesn't have associative arrays/hashes ;)
[09:32:28] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle huh?
[09:32:35] <anli__> exactly, so we need to use objects for those
[09:32:37] <duch_kazatel> why would you do that?
[09:32:40] <bberry> duch_kazatel i think Jattenalle means like var arr = { 0: 'foo', 1: 'bar' } as opposed to var arr = ['foo','bar']
[09:32:55] <duch_kazatel> right - the second one is basically the first under the hood.
[09:32:59] <bberry> yeah
[09:33:01] <duch_kazatel> which is why I'm confused.
[09:33:17] <Cork> except its '0': not 0:
[09:33:19] <bberry> oh, as to WHY Jattenalle does that, idk.
[09:33:20] <Jattenalle> yeah, they work the same, i'm just saying, in the code.. the end result when the code is executed is identical
[09:33:22] <anli__> What is the difference between an object and an assoc array then? :)
[09:33:24] <Cork> you can't use numbers as keys
[09:33:30] <bberry> Cork: yeah yeah  XD
[09:33:33] <codecowboy> duch_kazatel https://gist.github.com/codecowboy/617f6ffa50271007abdc
[09:33:33] <duch_kazatel> Cork right.
[09:33:34] <Cork> ;P
[09:33:42] <anli__> Cork: Yes you can?
[09:33:52] <anli__> var foo = {}; foo[34] = "goo";
[09:33:57] <Jattenalle> Cork, sure you can, you just myArray['5'].. oh... ;)
[09:34:03] <Cork> anli__: i meant in definition
[09:34:06] <anli__> ok
[09:34:17] <anli__> console.log(foo.34); is ok, isnt it?
[09:34:19] <Cork> foo[34] is the same thing as foo['34']
[09:34:31] <Cork> anli__: i don't think so, but not sure
[09:34:32] <duch_kazatel> codecowboy could you set up a working example on jsfiddle?
[09:34:49] <anli__> Cork: ah, true, keys are strings
[09:34:58] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; a[34] = 'yes'; print(a.34);
[09:35:14] <duch_kazatel> you can't start a key with a number iirc.  at least not per the spec.
[09:35:15] <bberry> i feel like itd try to interpret .34 as a number type
[09:35:16] <duch_kazatel> unless it's an array.
[09:35:19] <Cork> and the bot is anal as always...
[09:35:25] <anli__> hehe
[09:35:37] <anli__> ?eval print 'yes';
[09:35:40] <anli__> oops
[09:35:43] <anli__> ?eval print('yes');
[09:35:49] <Cork> i really need to take time to try to bring one up...
[09:35:54] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/uLJzw/
[09:35:57] <Cork> this one is a joke...
[09:36:03] <Jattenalle> i just access with [] though, so print(a[34]) which would work fine
[09:36:10] <anli__> Cork: Can you personally answer ?eval requests until the bot is up? ;)
[09:36:16] <Jattenalle> haha ^^
[09:36:17] <bberry> haha
[09:36:23] <Cork> anli__: see duch_kazatel
[09:36:26] <Cork> "SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list"
[09:36:28] <anli__> heh
[09:37:07] <Cork> anli__: and the bot is here, it just ... donno
[09:37:49] <bberry> b-ot is drunk
[09:38:08] <duch_kazatel> >> 2 + 2
[09:38:14] <Cork> btw should prob have asked this thing here
[09:38:29] <Cork> i found an interesting js syntax in a firefox bug a few days ago
[09:38:54] <Cork> anyone guessing what this means var {content} = func(); does?
[09:39:08] <Jattenalle> what the?
[09:39:09] <Cork> (this is standard btw)
[09:39:23] <duch_kazatel> looks like a really odd way to do a constructor almost.
[09:39:30] <duch_kazatel> without actually doing a constructor.
[09:39:35] <Cork> nope
[09:39:56] <Cork> lets expand it a bit
[09:39:58] <Cork> var {content: content} = func();
[09:40:52] <Cork> function func() { return { content: "hello" }; }; var {content: content} = func();
[09:40:59] <Cork> content === "hello"
[09:41:08] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaah
[09:41:17] <anli__> ?eval var a = 45; var foo = {a}; print foo.a; @Cork
[09:41:27] <Jattenalle> i dont understand it
[09:41:30] <duch_kazatel> adding the function's return makes a little more sense.
[09:41:33] <Jattenalle> and i disslike anythig i don't understand!
[09:41:34] <Cork> anli__: nope not possible
[09:41:40] <anli__> oh, ok
[09:41:46] <Cork> Jattenalle: its called desctructors
[09:41:58] <Jattenalle> sounds like black magic to me!
[09:42:07] <Cork> it might me easier to understand with arrays
[09:42:22] <bberry> how does that not syntax error with var {
[09:42:31] <Cork> var [title, body] = ["This is a test", "hello world"];
[09:42:32] <duch_kazatel> because that's a valid object.
[09:42:44] <Cork> bberry: its new in harmony
[09:42:45] <anli__> Cork: looks like lists in perl
[09:42:53] <Cork> anli__: it's where it has been taken from
[09:42:53] <bberry> harmony?
[09:42:56] <duch_kazatel> ES6
[09:42:58] <bberry> ah
[09:43:02] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/8KjAV/
[09:43:04] <bberry> interesting.
[09:43:13] <bberry> i was wtfing a brick trying to do it in es5
[09:43:23] <Cork> :)
[09:44:00] <decx> huh what
[09:44:10] <Cork> bberry: the funny part when i asked about it is that i hit another developer that had seen it and "hmm these can't do anything, and it looks ugly so lets remove it"
[09:44:18] <Cork> "hmm why doesn't it work..." XD
[09:44:32] <duch_kazatel> is that trying to force some kind of garbage collection or something?
[09:44:53] <Cork> duch_kazatel: no it just destructs objects and arrays into variables
[09:45:08] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaaah
[09:45:13] <ElysiumNet> destructs into variables?
[09:45:17] <Cork> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/8KjAV/1/
[09:45:25] <duch_kazatel> right.
[09:45:31] <bberry> deconstructs
[09:45:32] <bberry> rather
[09:45:40] <Cork> opps ya sorry
[09:45:41] <Cork> typo
[09:45:58] <ElysiumNet> I would have used the term extracted

[09:46:51] <bberry> lol
[09:47:03] <duch_kazatel> we were all wrong!
[09:47:04] <bberry> there it is!
[09:47:06] <Cork> http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:destructuring
[09:47:08] <Cork> ah
[09:47:15] <Cork> bah you be me..
[09:47:17] <duch_kazatel> http://www.techsavvyed.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/over-enthusiastic-kermit.gif
[09:47:31] <Cork> :D
[09:47:52] <Cork> man what was the other direction called again...
[09:48:09] <bberry> structuring
[09:48:14] <Cork> (where you use variables as keys in an object contstructor
[09:49:52] <Cork> ah, computed property names
[09:51:50] <Macaveli> Cork, hi ! :)
[09:52:26] <Macaveli> Cork, please notice this topic on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/503093/how-can-i-make-a-redirect-page-in-jquery-javascript they say "similar behavior as an HTTP redirect" and "similar behavior as clicking on a link" what's the difference?
[09:52:48] <duch_kazatel> Cork take notice!  you're beeing called on!  nobody else can help!
[09:52:57] <Cork> ya...
[09:53:45] <Cork> Macaveli: the difference is in what ends up in history
[09:53:56] <Macaveli> Cork, thanks :)
[09:54:39] <bberry> lol
[09:54:54] <duch_kazatel> thank god that was getting scary.
[09:56:29] <Cork> but computed properties will make object initialization weird
[09:56:53] <Cork> i feel bad for users coming into js after this lands and is green to it all
[09:57:29] <Cork> var var opt = { [func()] = arguments[2] };
[09:57:31] <Cork> yay...
[09:57:40] <Cork> opps
[09:57:43] <Cork> var var opt = { [func()]: arguments[2] };
[09:57:57] <RandalSchwartz> var var binks
[09:58:03] <Cork> uh...
[09:58:06] <Cork> another one >_<
[09:58:09] <Cork> var opt = { [func()]: arguments[2] };
[09:58:34] <RandalSchwartz> I believe the key of an object literal has to be literal
[09:58:36] <RandalSchwartz> not a function
[09:58:44] <Cork> RandalSchwartz: that is true today
[09:58:47] <Cork> but not in es6
[09:58:56] <RandalSchwartz> var opt = {}; opt[func()] = arguments[2]
[09:58:57] <Cork> and as that is what we're talking about
[09:59:04] <RandalSchwartz> oh sorry, walked in the middle again
[09:59:06] * RandalSchwartz wanders off
[09:59:36] <duch_kazatel> dammit donny!
[10:00:26] <duch_kazatel> You're like a child who wanders into the middle of a movie and wants to know what's going on!
[10:00:38] <Cork> heh
[10:01:19] <Cork> oh this one is nice too {[Math.random()]: secret }
[10:01:27] <duch_kazatel> NOOOOOOOOO
[10:01:41] <Cork> O_o
[10:01:52] <bberry> YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS DONNY
[10:01:55] <anli__> If there is a prototype method of a certain name on an object, can I override that with another method?
[10:02:14] <anli__> foo.isRecurrenceHead = function(){ return false;}; or something like that
[10:02:26] <Cork> anli__: yes
[10:02:30] <duch_kazatel> anli__ sure, but I'd be careful about when you do that.
[10:02:41] <duch_kazatel> and make it really obvious
[10:02:51] <anli__> Maybe I should delete the method when it has been used
[10:03:06] <anli__> delete foo.isRecurrenceHead, and I am back to prototype?
[10:03:28] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't change my point - make it very obviously that you're overriding the method.
[10:03:33] <duch_kazatel> deleting it might make things worse.
[10:03:34] <anli__> yes
[10:03:48] <anli__> I can save the previous one first and then reassign
[10:03:51] <bberry> i feel like javascript language releases give shiny new toys to js ninjas
[10:03:52] <Cork> duch_kazatel: you mean one shouldn't do Object.defineProperty(Array.property, 'length' { value: 0 }); ?
[10:04:02] <anli__> So the window where the method "override" is as short as possible
[10:04:05] <Cork> :D
[10:04:13] <anli__> hehe
[10:04:20] <duch_kazatel> Cork i am going to stab you.
[10:04:24] <Cork> LOL
[10:04:35] <bberry> lol.
[10:05:53] <duch_kazatel> omfg i have a coworker who has been sick for like 2 weeks now with this deep, annoying, chest cough.  People keep trying to politely suggest that she go home, and she keeps reiterating that she's not contageous as if that's what we're worried about.
[10:06:19] <duch_kazatel> we know she's not contageous.  it's still really really annoying.
[10:09:09] <Cork> duch_kazatel: i had a coworker that had no feeling of personal space
[10:09:23] <duch_kazatel> oh bummer.
[10:09:28] <Cork> so when you stood somewhere he could come and basically stand on your foots
[10:09:30] <duch_kazatel> did they ever figure it out?
[10:09:35] <Cork> it wasn't fun when he was sick...
[10:09:50] <duch_kazatel> that sounds terrible.
[10:09:53] <Cork> it was
[10:10:38] <Cork> ruined my summer 2week vecation once
[10:10:58] <duch_kazatel> got you sick?
[10:10:59] <Cork> that kinda pissed me of enough to get him to stay at home when he was sick
[10:11:01] <Cork> ya
[10:11:21] <duch_kazatel> that's really bad.
[10:11:39] <Cork> i ended up catching his cold three days before the vacation
[10:11:50] <duch_kazatel> kind of glad i opted to not go for team lead quite yet - I'm not ready to handle those kinds of situations.
[10:13:23] <duch_kazatel> Cork what was your original plan on that vacation?
[10:13:44] <Cork> duch_kazatel: go visiting my fokes
[10:13:54] <Cork> ended up lying in bed for 8 days...
[10:14:02] <duch_kazatel> D:
[10:14:22] <Cork> summer sickness is not fun takes for ever to get over them
[10:15:44] <Sergonium> you catch enough sunlight trough out the year?
[10:17:00] <Cork> Sergonium: sure, though that doesn't really matter if a sick coworker basically merars you with germs in june
[10:17:11] <Cork> july even
[10:17:59] <Cork> duch_kazatel: btw sidenote, they have apparently forbidden my example in more current specs
[10:18:03] <Cork> "ypeError: can't redefine non-configurable property 'length'"
[10:18:07] <duch_kazatel> good.
[10:18:14] <Cork> i know i did it back in like ff 8
[10:18:30] <bberry> i loved that game
[10:18:37] <Cork> LOL
[10:18:39] <bberry> :P
[10:18:55] <Cork> had to think a few times before i got what you meant :)
[10:19:03] <duch_kazatel> bberry++
[10:19:04] <bberry> haha. yeah i wasnt sure if anyone would
[10:19:26] <Cork> when the mind has to race to get it is the best ones ^^
[10:21:55] <bberry> just noticed theres someone in the channel named 'foo'
[10:22:14] <bberry> must have attention issues :P
[10:22:22] <bberry> jk jk!
[10:23:16] <duch_kazatel> ffff i hate our stack sometimes.
[10:23:30] <phelix> duch_kazatel: For that slider that I had created. I have it figured out how to do the math and formulas in live time using all of the sliders on that fiddle. But there are a few text fields that can manually be entered. How would I go about being able to add items from the slider to a simple input field and have it automiatically update values?
[10:23:51] <duch_kazatel> wut
[10:24:00] <duch_kazatel> ah
[10:24:04] <phelix> Let me add a field to that fiddle I'll show you
[10:24:06] <duch_kazatel> phelix does the text field update the slider?
[10:24:16] <duch_kazatel> or are these input fields not tied to a slider?
[10:24:29] <phelix> no but I'll need to add its value to that of a specific slider
[10:24:41] <duch_kazatel> then you can listen to that inputs change event
[10:24:49] <phelix> ok nvm you have a input field on that fiddle example
[10:25:10] <phelix> ok, and this will also be put inside the same area I am doing everything else this way all events are being listend to?
[10:25:13] <phelix> if that makes any sense lol
[10:25:42] <phelix> nvm let me just play with it. What y ou said makes sense.
[10:25:50] <duch_kazatel> if you want to get those values and work with then during the slide, you'll need to set up a second .each() that'll enumerate over those and add them to that object.
[10:26:33] <duch_kazatel> you might want to abstract out that logic in that slide callback into a separate function and call that since you'll need to do the same stuff when the new inputs change.
[10:26:48] <phelix> ok, should this other .each() be put inside of the slide: function(even, ui) { like where everything else is?
[10:27:04] <duch_kazatel> where else would you put it?
[10:27:11] <duch_kazatel> the slide callback is where all that logic has to go.
[10:27:11] <phelix> bottom of the page lol
[10:27:12] <phelix> ok.
[10:27:15] <phelix> ok
[10:27:19] <phelix> thats what i thought
[10:27:21] <duch_kazatel> otherwise the logic won't run when the slide happens.
[10:27:29] <phelix> yah thats what I thought ok.. think I got it
[10:31:22] <duch_kazatel> http://rawgit.com/ neeeeat.
[10:39:50] <phelix> .each() will not work as a listener will it?
[10:40:27] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:40:33] <duch_kazatel> .each() is for enumerating things.
[10:40:42] <duch_kazatel> .on() is how you bind listeners.
[10:41:13] <phelix> ok I was using .change maybe that was my problem
[10:41:24] <duch_kazatel> .change() is the same as .on('change'
[10:41:34] <duch_kazatel> uses it under the hood.
[10:41:55] <duch_kazatel> the change event fires when you click out of the input.
[10:43:16] <duch_kazatel> you might want to use keypress or something like it.
[10:43:26] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/39/
[10:43:30] <phelix> am i on the right track here?
[10:43:33] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:50:20] <duch_kazatel> phelix no.
[10:50:33] <duch_kazatel> you're binding listeners you don't need.
[10:50:45] <duch_kazatel> the each is implied when you do $('.input-value').on("change", function () {
[10:50:56] <duch_kazatel> that will bind a listener to all .input-value
[10:51:14] <duch_kazatel> you don't want to run that binding inside of the slide logic.
[10:51:36] <phelix> ok, so I can just remove the .each
[10:51:44] <duch_kazatel> no.
[10:51:50] <duch_kazatel> wahttp://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/40/
[10:52:03] <BillCriswell>  /40... been a long day for someone.
[10:52:07] <duch_kazatel> you're completely turned around/
[10:52:19] <duch_kazatel> phelix you need to do the .each() to get the values.
[10:52:41] <duch_kazatel> the .on() should be be done outside of the slide: callback.
[10:52:47] <phelix> ohh
[10:52:55] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell they've been working on this for a while =/
[10:53:07] <duch_kazatel> phelix you only need to bind once.
[10:53:25] <duch_kazatel> this is why I suggested you abstract out all your logic to a separate function and call that from your callbacks instead.
[10:53:50] <duch_kazatel> because now you'll have to basically copy that entire slide handler and paste it in your change handler.
[10:54:12] <phelix> hmm
[10:54:32] <duch_kazatel> this is why learning some javascript/jquery basics would be a great idea.
[10:54:54] <BillCriswell> I don't have time for the basics. I want rock star status immediately.
[10:54:56] <phelix> ya
[10:55:18] <duch_kazatel> phelix in the time you've been working on this, you could've learned the basics you needed and had the project done
[10:55:33] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i'm writing that very blog post.
[10:55:46] <phelix> yah, maybe. I am learning a lot though.
[10:56:19] <duch_kazatel> you put an .on() inside an .each() inside a slide event handler =/
[10:56:28] <bberry> ~that feeling when you realize that youve been using 'change' events and theyre only supported by ie11+~
[10:57:27] <duch_kazatel> that feel
[10:57:58] <BillCriswell> bberry: Say what?
[10:59:56] <bberry> ive been using $(selector).on("change", function(){ a;lskdfja;kdj });
[11:02:20] <gerep> Hey, anyone here using Datatables(https://datatables.net/) can help me change the amount of lines showed?
[11:02:31] <gerep> What option should I use?
[11:02:54] <BillCriswell> bberry: You said that doesn't work in ie10-
[11:07:16] <bberry> BillCriswell: oh nevermind, i was looking at mutation observer
[11:08:35] <bberry> looks like the change event got put in in html5
[11:09:03] <bberry> now i have no idea what ie version it works for
[11:09:12] <bberry> ie8+?
[11:10:58] <BillCriswell> bberry: Change has been around a while.
[11:11:10] <bberry> since the beginning of time, you could say
[11:11:15] <BillCriswell> Haha, yes.
[11:11:19] <bberry> :P
[11:11:37] <BillCriswell> I'd imagine it's good all the way back to IE5 at least haha
[11:11:42] <bberry> aight
[11:25:43] <bberry> if i do $("#myElem").data('foo', 'bar'); then do console.log($("#myElem")); will i be able to find the foo:bar?
[11:30:26] <Macaveli> Cork, still here? :)
[11:31:50] <duch_kazatel> COOOORD WE NEED YOU
[11:31:52] <duch_kazatel> *COORK
[11:33:03] <duch_kazatel> bberry huh?
[11:33:30] <bberry> im trying to add 'foo' to the data of #myElem
[11:33:39] <bberry> but then when i console.log #myElem, i cant find where it got added
[11:33:46] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/r7dEh/
[11:34:05] <duch_kazatel> .data() adds it to a special cached area iirc.
[11:34:17] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/41/ now down at the bottom using the .bind I am able to get the value when I change an input.. Just can't quite figure out how to get that info back inside the each area inside the slider event.
[11:34:22] <Jon47> bberry: I think if it's added in the markup you would see it in $('#myElem')[0].dataset
[11:34:36] <duch_kazatel> phelix use .on() instead of .bind()
[11:35:00] <phelix> ok
[11:35:06] <duch_kazatel> phelix use .on('change'
[11:35:20] <phelix> k
[11:35:41] <duch_kazatel> why are you initializing all the sliders twice?
[11:36:13] <phelix> not sure, this is how you helped me set this up
[11:36:24] <phelix> using .on change the input doesn't update until I hit enter
[11:36:25] <duch_kazatel> i didn't initialize everything twice.
[11:36:40] <duch_kazatel> phelix right.  you probably want keypress
[11:36:42] <phelix> are you talking about the very last function at the bottom?
[11:36:45] <duch_kazatel> or keyup
[11:37:11] <duch_kazatel> phelix i'm talking about the two $('.slide-bar').each(function () { at the bottom, yes
[11:37:20] <duch_kazatel> one of those is redundant.
[11:37:43] <bberry> *sigh* nvm. my coworker was doing it in an event callback, and was doing 'e.taget' and not 'e.target'
[11:37:53] <phelix> without that bottom function i have no slide bars
[11:38:04] <duch_kazatel> phelix you're calling the same function twice.
[11:38:08] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/42/
[11:38:16] <BillCriswell> You need to call it three times.
[11:38:18] <bberry> Jon47 yeah i looked there and it wasnt there, thus my confusion XD
[11:38:21] <duch_kazatel> this is becoming surreal.
[11:38:36] <bberry> but yeah, jquery definitely has some cached data for that stuff
[11:38:41] <bberry> that is abstracted away
[11:40:33] <phelix> ok, yah keyup works well.
[11:40:40] <duch_kazatel> phelix and abstract out that function - here's a hacky version: http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/43/
[11:40:55] <duch_kazatel> that way you can later call doMagic() in your keyup.
[11:41:09] <duch_kazatel> but you should probably modify that function to not need some of those args.
[11:41:34] <phelix> ok let me play with this. thank you.
[12:10:38] <phelix> duch_kazatel: So would I do something like so at the bottom to call this function on my event? $('.input-value').on('keyup', doMagic(event, ui, $displayLocation));
[12:11:08] <duch_kazatel> phelix you need to refactor your code so you can get the proper values fed to that function, but that's the basic idea, yes.
[12:11:42] <phelix> so that function shouldn't need event and ui should it?
[12:11:54] <duch_kazatel> that function currently relies on those values.
[12:12:14] <duch_kazatel> you need to either feed thos evalues to the function, or refactor it so it determines them itself.
[12:13:35] <phelix> well I am trying to look at how you called it inside the initSlider function. and I don't see where you are setting any value to the event or the ui there.
[12:14:03] <duch_kazatel> read the code dude.
[12:14:08] <duch_kazatel> you really can't see it?
[12:14:13] <duch_kazatel> I'm passing through args.
[12:14:15] <phelix> it appears that inside the function its getting the $displayLocation from inside it
[12:15:30] <duch_kazatel> those values don't just exist - in the simple hacked together version I made, I showed you a basic, barely functioning version.
[12:15:42] <duch_kazatel> it's up to you to figure out the rest.
[12:15:48] <phelix> k
[12:30:06] <decx> ugh, everytime i click interested on a fiddle in here in the last couple of days it's this slider calculator, so boring :(
[12:30:44] <BillCriswell> They're so abused.
[12:34:47] <t432> is there a way to find out if the internet connection is active or disconnected?
[12:35:32] <t432> I have an sse event that i would like to stop if their is no connection.
[12:49:03] <t432> anyone awake?
[12:49:41] <BillCriswell> Unfortunately.
[12:50:41] <duch_lunch> "sse"?
[12:51:25] <duch_lunch> t432 why would they disconnect in the middle of an operation?
[12:51:32] <duch_lunch> sounds like a real XY
[12:51:50] <seich> t432: Can't you just do an ajax request and see if that fails?
[12:52:23] <t432> duch_lunch: I have an sse event that keeps running even when network is down.  I;d like to stop the event when disconnected or when server is down.
[12:52:33] <duch_lunch> what is sse?
[12:52:39] <t432> server side event
[12:52:45] <seich> There's also: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline
[12:52:50] <decx> it's server sent
[12:52:56] <t432> typo
[12:53:47] <duch_lunch> so you want to stop the server from sending events after the client has lost connection.
[12:53:57] <t432> yes
[12:54:01] <duch_lunch> how do you expect to solve that with client-side code?
[12:54:47] <duch_lunch> put another way - if the client has lost connection, how would it tell the server about it?
[12:55:07] <t432> duch_lunch: Client is attempting to query the server even on network disconnect, i'd like to stop it from doing so.
[12:55:44] <seich> Stop the client, right?
[12:56:10] <duch_lunch> okay, so you want to have the client stop querying.  that makes a little more sense.  if this query is being done through ajax, just setup a queueing system that, in fail, stops.
[12:56:17] <t432> server sent event queries the server periodically to check if there is any update.  i'd like stop this when the the network is down.
[12:56:20] <t432> make sense?
[12:56:36] <duch_lunch> t432 it was, and then your last message confused it again.
[12:56:42] <decx> you get an error and then you stop your thing
[12:57:09] <duch_lunch> but the basic gist is what decx is saying, either way.
[12:58:01] <t432> then how would i check when the network is up again?
[12:58:15] <duch_lunch> that's the part we can't really answer.
[12:58:15] <meowsus> Any Rails developers in here? Know the preferred way to submit PUT and DELETE requests? I read that it was the _method patch, but that doesn't seem to apply to Rails 3.2
[12:58:37] <t432> i need to think about this a little.
[12:58:49] <duch_lunch> t432 if you're talking about stopping the client side from making requests, just put in some error handling.
[12:58:58] <duch_lunch> if you're talking about the server side, that's a different beast.
[13:01:29] <devslash> is it better to use a jquery plugin or an iframe to display a simple modal popup window? I need to load a url in the window
[13:01:44] <duch_kazatel> devslash entirely depends on where you're pulling content from.
[13:01:53] <duch_kazatel> devslash the modal can be powered by jquery regardless.
[13:01:54] <devslash> from another page on my site
[13:02:01] <meowsus> devslash: yeah, but if it's a popup regular javascript is clearner
[13:02:14] <devslash> yes but i want it to be modal
[13:02:17] <duch_kazatel> then use ajax, or setup a template you embed in your page.
[13:02:33] <duch_kazatel> devslash modals are powered by javascript.
[13:07:57] <_rgn> does anyone know what ev.stopPropagation(); ev.preventDefault() do with drop event, I seem to get the same result with just return false
[13:08:17] <duch_kazatel> return false; is a hacky way to do what those do.
[13:08:25] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/45/ I am pretty close here
[13:08:33] <duch_kazatel> use the event methods, instead of return false;
[13:08:58] <phelix> $displayLocation.val(ui.value); this is kinda messing things up. Its needed for the slider but breaks the input. When removed the input fieldsworks fine but then breaks the sliders
[13:09:15] <duch_kazatel> phelix do you klnow how to write functions?
[13:09:48] <phelix> with php yes. Seems pretty close or same concept with jquery just really awkward syntax
[13:09:55] <duch_kazatel> *javascript
[13:09:57] <duch_kazatel> not jquery
[13:10:08] <duch_kazatel> you still have to pass around data, or access data in the same scope.
[13:10:39] <duch_kazatel> i'll re-fix this code.
[13:10:40] <duch_kazatel> again.
[13:10:53] <phelix> well inside the doMagic I am passing info into that function. But it appears that the .input-value each() doesn't need any of it as it gets it from the html
[13:10:58] <decx> i've been looking at these fiddles in the last 3 days and nothing changes
[13:11:22] <duch_kazatel> decx yeah i know.  and i've asked them to actually try and they keep giving excuses.
[13:11:28] <phelix> decx: Tons been changing. I went from nothing working yesterday to almost having it complete
[13:11:31] <drej> decx you keep looking at the same fiddle ?
[13:11:40] <decx> seemingly yes
[13:11:42] <duch_kazatel> phelix you keep making the same mistakes.
[13:11:44] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I been making good progress I think
[13:12:04] <decx> didnt i write a tab function example for that thing like a week ago
[13:12:08] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/fYT05Sq.png
[13:12:19] <duch_kazatel> how many times are you going to make this same mistake?
[13:12:29] <duch_kazatel> I have corrected it a few times, and you keep bringing it back in.
[13:12:38] <phelix> I haven't changed that since I first put it in there.
[13:12:43] <duch_kazatel> right - I have.
[13:12:54] <phelix> not sure how. when you make changes I copy what you done into my editor.. that is odd
[13:13:10] <phelix> I haven't manually changed that since I first added it. This is weird. not sure whats up with that
[13:13:13] <duch_kazatel> do you understand why that bit doesn't make any sense?
[13:13:54] <phelix> Well, I have no idea what theResult is as its not called anywhere. I just saw you did that for oyur first array you created so i duplicated it for my second array I am trying to create
[13:13:58] <duch_kazatel> also, looking at doMagic, you're passing event as an argument and never using it.  you can probably drop that.
[13:14:14] <duch_kazatel> phelix right, and then your code removed the need for it.
[13:14:21] <phelix> Yea, It required that i put something in there. It kept giving me errors but it doesn't need any of that stuff
[13:14:37] <duch_kazatel> phelix it's using the ui and displaylocation args.
[13:15:05] <phelix> the slidebars are but not the input values
[13:15:09] <duch_kazatel> update the method signature to remove the extra arg you don't need.
[13:15:16] <duch_kazatel> and then fix from there.
[13:16:22] <duch_kazatel> also, you're passing inputVal, which is defined as var inputVal = $this.val();, and then in your function you're using that arg like this: $displayLocation.val(ui.value);
[13:17:10] <phelix> yah that is whats b reaking everything. the slidebars need that but not the input values
[13:17:15] <duch_kazatel> ...
[13:17:17] <duch_kazatel> so then fix it.
[13:17:26] <duch_kazatel> it should be pretty obvious what changes you need to make.
[13:18:25] <phelix> I know what change needs made just not sure the syntax. Thats whats kicking my butt. with php if i want to pass an empty var in a function I could easily just add function(NULL, $blah); doesn't seem to like that with jq but I can go google it
[13:18:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:18:38] <duch_kazatel> empty var?
[13:18:39] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[13:18:54] <duch_kazatel> i give up.
[13:19:09] <duch_kazatel> and stop conflating jquery with javascript.
[13:20:08] <duch_kazatel> i should write an article on abstraction in javascript.
[13:23:16] <bee_keeper> hi there, i'm looking for a jquery plugin which will easily allow me to give it a user selected image and then render that image at a specified size (100x100), nothing fancy, just clean and simple.  Any ideas please?
[13:23:41] <duch_kazatel> "render that iamge at a specified size" - rephrase the question.  why do you think you need this?
[13:23:55] <phelix> i really can not figure out how with using this same function for both the slider and the input values to only use $displayLocation.val(ui.value); on the sliders. Unless I create use an if
[13:25:05] <duch_kazatel> phelix abstract out your logic and call it as needed.
[13:25:35] <duch_kazatel> phelix and change how your shipping data around.
[13:25:38] <duch_kazatel> it's really not hard.
[13:26:14] <phelix> hmm
[13:33:11] <bee_keeper> duch_kazatel: well i want to mimic an ajax img upload without actually doing it
[13:33:43] <duch_kazatel> then style the image.  that whole rendering concept is going to cause headaches.
[13:33:59] <decx> load it in a canvas
[13:34:34] <decx> bee_keeper http://jsfiddle.net/decx/7Ke62/ that's the basic for cropping
[13:35:55] <phelix> hmm, maybe ive just gone completly brain dead but I can't for the life of me figure out how to not use that $displayLocation.val(ui.value) on the input values. =/
[13:36:11] <duch_kazatel> phelix think holistically budday ;)
[13:36:26] <duch_kazatel> step away from it and move onto something else, or start learning javascript.
[13:36:39] <decx> rekt
[13:36:45] <duch_kazatel> unf
[13:37:42] <phelix>  well can't do anything else till I can get the values set to these input fields.. hmm
[13:38:59] <bee_keeper> decx: yep that's exactly it. so simple i guess i don't even need a plugin?
[13:39:15] <phelix> I don't even understand how thats effecting anything. nothing inside  each() is using this variable infact nothing seems to need that except the initSlider function
[13:39:38] <duch_kazatel> phelix right.  abstraction.
[13:39:41] <duch_kazatel> you're getting there ;)
[13:40:56] <decx> bee_keeper you still need to automate it, but that's a way to resize&crop an image
[13:41:05] <phelix> how though does that mess with my input values? if I am not calling it anywhere
[13:41:21] <duch_kazatel> phelix walk through the code man come on.
[13:41:25] <duch_kazatel> you can figure this out.
[13:41:41] <phelix> Well it seems its only there so that you can pass that info into the initSlider
[13:42:17] <bee_keeper> decx: thanks a lot.
[13:43:32] <phelix> I mean the iniSlider is passing it to the doMagic function but nothing in that function is using it but it still has an effect on things in there..
[13:43:48] <duch_kazatel> link the fiddle again
[13:44:19] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/46/
[13:44:34] <duch_kazatel> so which arge are you confused about?
[13:45:13] <phelix> $displayLocation.val(ui.value); <---- this inside the doMagic function
[13:45:25] <duch_kazatel> and you really can't see the problem?
[13:45:42] <phelix> I can't, I don't see where in that function it even needs it
[13:45:53] <duch_kazatel> needs what?  the .val() set?
[13:45:57] <phelix> the slide-input stuff isn't calling anything from it
[13:46:02] <duch_kazatel> because if that's where you're confused, you're way off.
[13:46:28] <duch_kazatel> ui.value
[13:46:31] <duch_kazatel> there's your issue.
[13:46:41] <duch_kazatel> think about why
[13:46:46] <phelix> but why does that function even need this?
[13:46:55] <phelix> why does doMagic need that?
[13:47:03] <duch_kazatel> remove it and tell me.
[13:47:05] <phelix> how is that effecting the info inside those arrays that I am creating
[13:47:15] <duch_kazatel> you're not making any arrays.
[13:47:23] <duch_kazatel> remove that line, run it, and tell me what happenjs.
[13:47:26] <phelix> I have removed it. the input values array works properly but not the slider arrays
[13:47:35] <duch_kazatel> those are not arrays.
[13:47:37] <duch_kazatel> those are objects.
[13:47:48] <phelix> sorry, that is what I meant
[13:48:02] <duch_kazatel> so that's why you need that.
[13:48:04] <phelix> I have removed it. The input values work fine and then the sliders get the NaN
[13:48:22] <duch_kazatel> so you need it.
[13:48:29] <duch_kazatel> because other things rely on the values.
[13:48:55] <phelix> ok, so its setting something inside the slider object?
[13:49:13] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:49:38] <duch_kazatel> initSlider($this, $currentInput);
[13:49:43] <duch_kazatel> what would $currentInput be?
[13:50:23] <duch_kazatel> down at the bottom,
[13:51:03] <phelix> yeah I'm looking at that. the function call at the button passes that info about the input to the initSlider and I can see where the initSlider needs it
[13:51:14] <phelix> but why is it being passed from that function into the doMagic ?
[13:51:55] <duch_kazatel> because doMagic needs to know which input you're updating for each slider.
[13:52:54] <phelix> seems to me that as the each() goes through each item it would get it from the $this.val()
[13:53:13] <phelix> just like how the input-value is getting its data
[13:53:28] <duch_kazatel> then fucking rewrite it.
[13:53:31] <duch_kazatel> i'm done.
[14:02:38] <t432> server url in this sse event seems to be correct, so why the error? http://pastebin.com/CN5d7YtD
[14:18:31] <f00b44> hey, anyone know how i can add the Jquery Ajax funtionality to a 3rd party library i'm making? I need to be able to make CORS POST requests using another library and would like to use $.ajax, not sure how to add it all in as it all has to be within 1 js file on my side!??!?!!?!?!?!
[14:21:53] <f00b44> anybody?
[14:23:10] <__joshua__> sorry, what was question?
[14:24:22] <f00b44> @__joshua__: hey, anyone know how i can add the Jquery Ajax funtionality to a 3rd party library i'm making? I need to be able to make CORS POST requests using another library and would like to use $.ajax, not sure how to add it all in as it all has to be within 1 js file on my side!??!?!!?!?!?!
[14:24:35] <NoiseEee> f00b44: you can require jquery as a pre-requisite for your 3rd party library .... or you can just look for a cross-browser ajax/xhr example from somewhere on line (must be gazillions)
[14:25:07] <__joshua__> all has to be in 1 file?
[14:25:27] <f00b44> NoiseEee: nothing that I can find that is crossbrowser with POST and IE8+9 basically
[14:25:34] <f00b44> __joshua__: yip
[14:26:06] <NoiseEee> well f00b44 xhr has been around since IE 5.5 so I might call shenanigans on that
[14:26:37] <__joshua__> many, many libs require jq as a dependency, look up module patterns.  or just use xhr and forget dependencies
[14:26:46] <f00b44> NoiseEee: Yes, but XDomainRequest and XMLHttpRequest and etc can drive one insane when it comes to unit testing. any direction on this?
[14:26:50] <NoiseEee> cors/xhr is IE8. http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/ @ f00b44
[14:27:28] <f00b44> NoiseEee: The amount of times I've seen that URL.... It doesnt actually do the job 100% of the time....
[14:27:34] <NoiseEee> lol
[14:28:06] <f00b44> NoiseEee: !lol
[14:28:41] <NoiseEee> f00b44: well not sure what else so suggest. either demand jquery as a prerequisite for your plugin, or create one out of natural JS :|
[14:29:20] <f00b44> NoiseEee: any idea how I can include it in my library all in 1 file? best practise?
[14:29:37] <__joshua__> including in 1 file is not best practice
[14:29:51] <NoiseEee> f00b44: use several files, add a step of concat/minification that results in 1 file at the very end
[14:29:53] <f00b44> __joshua__: :D annnd?
[14:31:09] <f00b44> Any particular version best for this? 1.11? 1.8.0? 1.6.4?
[14:31:26] <NoiseEee> also i don't understand what 'I need to be able to make CORS POST requests using another library ' means
[14:31:33] <NoiseEee> you already have a library for doing so?
[14:32:46] <t432> server url in this sse event seems to be correct, so why the error? http://pastebin.com/CN5d7YtD
[14:34:05] <NoiseEee> laters
[14:34:14] <f00b44> NoiseEee: My clients are supposed to use my js file (which they include in their page) and 1 thing they do using it requires a cross domain POST request to happen... It works well until IE8 comes into play... Then the internal choice of XDomainRequest and XMLHttpRequest fail.. I need a sure proof way of this working 100%... ?!
[14:34:29] <f00b44> You better run :D
[14:35:15] <__joshua__> dont include jq for this, just add a shim
[14:35:39] <f00b44> __joshua__: example?
[14:36:10] <__joshua__> http://jpillora.com/xhook/example/ie-8-9-cors-polyfill.html
[14:36:46] <f00b44> __joshua__: looks interesting
[14:39:56] <__joshua__> but if you can't be bothered, just dump jquery ~2.0 in your file, or add a build step to your development
[14:40:34] <f00b44> __joshua__: ~2.0 doesnt support IE8...
[14:44:08] <__joshua__> right, so go newest with ie8 support
[14:44:40] <__joshua__> will the user be running query as well?
[14:45:03] <f00b44> __joshua__: some will some wont...
[14:46:07] <__joshua__> another reason not to include, but if you must, you need to http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/
[14:52:23] <Zzaichik> Hey gusy
[14:52:24] <Zzaichik> guys*
[14:52:34] <Zzaichik> anyone know of a solid plugin for "scroll hijacking"
[14:52:35] <Zzaichik> ?
[14:53:14] <__joshua__> sounds annoying
[14:53:21] <Zzaichik> oh man, it seriously is.
[14:53:28] <Zzaichik> But some clients are super dumb so...
[14:53:50] <__joshua__> whats your use case?  to scroll until something is visible?
[14:54:21] <Zzaichik> start to scroll, control the scroll speed regardless of how fast they scroll, keep going until they hit a specific point.
[14:54:43] <__joshua__> hmmmm
[14:54:58] <__joshua__> start to scroll === 'user starts to scroll'?
[14:55:53] <__joshua__> ive used this with success https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo
[14:56:06] <__joshua__> you probably want to preventDefault on user scrolls
[14:57:37] <Zzaichik> I'll give that a look! Thanks man
[15:13:49] <Bri_1015> after creating a variable like var foo=$('#something'); what's the difference between $(foo).text('blah') and foo.text('blah') ??
[15:15:23] <decx> $(foo) is just double wrapped unnecessarily
[15:16:33] <Bri_1015> ok that's good because I stopped double wrapping a bit ago and didn't know if I was doing something wrong
[15:17:30] <Bri_1015> that's funny because I see people doing that all the time
[15:18:00] <Bri_1015> that's why I did it in the first place
[15:20:28] <\mSg> You don't happen to mean... $foo=$('#foo'); then later $foo.text('blah')
[15:20:52] <Bri_1015> no not that
[15:21:56] <Bri_1015> but that is kinda annoying to add a $ before normal variables
[15:22:27] <\mSg> it just identifies that it's related to jquery :p
[15:22:54] <Bri_1015> that makes sense :|
[17:40:56] <wa5ted> grafi: you here
[19:37:10] <krept`> could someone assist with this ajax call?  http://hastebin.com/cizopuhizo.xml  the initial call is working, everything works.  but I'm having trouble figuring how how I should redeclare the lastchecked variable to send to the php file, otherwise it will keep returning the same posts over and over using the initial time set when the page loaded
[19:48:57] <henryweinhard> Can I detect types of events in event delegation? something like $('#divholder').on('mouseenter, click, mouseleave', '#div1, #div2', function(e) {}
[22:51:52] <pzuraq> I'm getting some really weird behavior when I try to chain promises
[22:52:00] <pzuraq> find I'm unable to continue animating the object
[23:00:42] <jphase> pzuraq: happen to have a code sample?
[23:02:20] <pzuraq> jphase: I think it's actually a problem with knockout, I was assuming it was a problem with promise chaining but it appears the method that calls the chaining stops triggering for some reason
[23:02:51] <jphase> sounds more likely
