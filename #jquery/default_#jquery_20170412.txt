[01:49:23] <mnemonicj> hi, i'm looking to create a variable with text into a hyperlink, this is my function: https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=RnNBtkVLUy
[01:49:52] <mnemonicj> i wanna convert the value in "data.url" into a hyperlink directly, but google's not helping me much
[01:50:15] <mnemonicj> any help?
[01:54:16] <Stutters> mnemonicj: would something like this help you?: $("span").replaceWith('<a href="link">link text</a>');
[01:55:29] <mnemonicj> @Stutters i forgot to mention that the actual href link should be "data.url"
[01:55:37] <Stutters> mnemonicj: http://jsfiddle.net/cSZGr/1/ <--- here's an example somebody on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8765441/turn-text-into-a-link-with-jquery provided
[01:56:07] <Stutters> mnemonicj: you mean you wanna put in "data.url" literally?
[01:57:14] <Stutters> mnemonicj: I mean you can hardcode it then.. if you wanna pass some actual value as data and url, you can extend that function :) did I forget something?^^
[01:57:35] <mnemonicj> @Stutters, that's exactly what i want. how can i go about with it?
[01:59:02] <Uhkis> mnemonicj: what is that #url-result of yours?
[01:59:29] <mnemonicj> $("span").replaceWith('<a href="link">link text</a>'); <-- how can i replace "link" with the contents in data.url?
[02:00:15] <mnemonicj> #url-result is just a span id @Uhkis
[02:00:35] <Stutters> mnemonicj: I'm not good with jquery, but I think something like this: '<a href="' + data.url + '">link text</a>'
[02:01:08] <Stutters> mnemonicj: notice how there's the ' and the ".. they're somewhat confusing right now because they're so close together
[02:01:09] <mnemonicj> thanks @Stutters, i will give it a try
[02:01:16] <Stutters> mnemonicj: :)
[02:03:44] <mnemonicj> oh my god wow, that works great @Stutters. thank you so much again
[02:04:34] <Stutters> mnemonicj: you're welcome :)
[02:05:10] <Stutters> mnemonicj: remember: everything in " " or ' ' js takes literally, so you should first close those and append things with a + :)
[02:05:26] <mnemonicj> ah, one last thing. how would i replace the "link text" text with the actual text from my "data.url" variable?
[02:05:53] <mnemonicj> also, do " " and ' ' work the same in js?
[02:06:07] <Stutters> mnemonicj: you mean the >link text< one?
[02:06:15] <mnemonicj> yes, that one
[02:06:19] <Uhkis> do it just like that data.url part
[02:06:36] <Uhkis> >' + text + '</a>
[02:06:42] <Stutters> mnemonicj: I believe they do.. I've never seen a difference.. (in php for instance they ARE different indeed, in js I think they're the same :))
[02:07:01] <Stutters> mnemonicj: what Uhkis said :)
[02:07:07] <mnemonicj> XDDDD perfect Uhkis
[02:07:09] <mnemonicj> thanks a bunch
[02:08:21] <Uhkis> also, if you wanna keep that <span> in your markup, use html() instead of replaceWith()
[02:09:55] <mnemonicj> thanks
[02:10:07] <mnemonicj> html() works just as well
[02:10:49] <Stutters> when doing $.ajax.. what dataType should I be choosing? I want to produce some content by PHP, then add it via jquery to a div (which should be interpreted as html or plain text within the div)
[02:11:42] <Uhkis> i usually let jquery decide
[02:11:52] <Stutters> dataType: 'json' doesn't seem to work when I'm not building a json. what I mean by that is that console.log(result) doesn't output my result in the console at all^
[02:11:52] <Uhkis> as in not set datatype at all
[02:12:09] <Stutters> Uhkis: any problems with doing that?
[02:12:35] <Uhkis> Stutters: in many years of doing jquery, havent encountered any
[02:13:14] <Stutters> Uhkis: also.. how do you make some well formatted html-code get interpreted and appended as a content in a div? .html()?
[02:14:13] <Uhkis> append() sounds more appropriate :)
[02:15:01] <Stutters> Uhkis: thank you :)
[02:16:25] <Stutters> Uhkis: yes, that's perfect! thanks :)
[02:16:36] <Uhkis> np
[02:56:55] <Stutters> when you have <form>... <input id="input1" type="text"></form>.. can you make #input1 submit form onChange?
[02:59:04] <Stutters> oh, I got this, I think^^: onChange=this.form.submit()
[03:00:29] <Stutters> it seems this doesn't send it though ajax :/
[03:06:17] <FilipNortic> Stutters: no that sumbits the from if you want to use ajax then you put a function there instead and use it to send ajax
[03:07:21] <FilipNortic> but i would recomend using a .change(function(){}) instead that is the modern way (the attribut events are almost ancient now)
[03:10:12] <Stutters> FilipNortic: can you show me how that would look like with <form>... <input id="input1" type="text"></form>? I do have the complete ajax function, I just don't know how to bind it :|
[03:11:18] <Stutters> FilipNortic: I got this so far: $(document).ready(function() {$('form').submit(function(event) {..ajax things here..}
[03:12:13] <Stutters> FilipNortic: if I understood you correctly I wouldn't even need to put my new function you talked about in the .ready(){}.. right?
[03:12:17] <FilipNortic> Stutters: that would work 2 if you do event.preventDefault() in there
[03:12:29] <Stutters> FilipNortic: I do that indeed
[03:13:01] <Stutters> FilipNortic: but it doesn't get prevented.. my page gets reloaded displaying proper output of my php file^^
[03:13:35] <FilipNortic> Stutters: then you might what trigger("submit") in the onChange instead
[03:13:54] <FilipNortic> want*
[03:14:12] <Stutters> FilipNortic: okay, that makes sense, I will try that :) thank you :)
[03:14:59] <FilipNortic> if that works you can change it to a modern event in the ready function that does the same thing
[03:28:30] <Stutters> okay, I'm screwing up big time.. .change works with alert for instance, but doesn't work with .submit
[03:29:03] <Stutters> then when I press "submit" manually, it requests amount equal to input length of my string..
[03:29:32] <Stutters> => if I input "test", 4 requests get sent... I'm a genius, I would never be able to code it like that if I wanted to :D
[08:12:01] <Rockwood> clear
[10:20:49] <Es0teric> ok so i have this code here: https://pastebin.com/XWbpWQgv but i need to add an ajax call that fetches a current reaction based off the activity-id and appends a class.. i was thinking of putting that ajax call after line 25 but still in the .each() scope of the reaction_emoji's
[10:21:35] <Es0teric> would that be correct? i know doing ajax calls in an each loop is bad practice... but i need the activity-ids of each ul to check if they were reacted to... (this is NOT on a click event)
[11:02:06] <twg_> I know this is a noob question but when I use https://kopy.io/ko6oC#Hh76KIjFLJk2iD, the item that should be hidden is shown when the page loads/reloads
[11:03:33] <taplar_> on load the scroll event would not have happened yet
[11:05:03] <twg_> Okay.  So I just need to add a single line to hide it when the page loads?
[11:05:47] <taplar_> either run the logic on load manually or you could try changing your binding to $(window).on('scroll load', function() ... )
[11:07:18] <twg_> Okay, that works but it makes it flash up on the screen at first.
[11:07:51] <taplar_> yeah, as there is a slight delay between it rendering and the script running
[11:08:02] <twg_> Trying to just run .hide on the element to see if that will keep it from flashing
[11:11:55] <twg_> taplar_: okay, I'm using a class to hide show it now.  Is there a way to make it still fade when the class is added or removed?
[11:13:02] <VeryBewitching> Hey folks.  I've been looking all morning for a way to scroll to a specific <td> in a table whose header remains fixed (see https://gist.github.com/bewitchingme/59a71c014376d0a886634e2a10c409dd for CSS) but am having no luck with any libraries or plugins for jQuery to scroll to an element that's hidden by overflow-y
[11:13:08] <VeryBewitching> Anyone tried doing this before?
[11:13:17] <taplar_> default the markup to have style="display:none" and let the scroll event show it if it needs to show
[11:15:42] <sigdk> Here I populate a div with data I fetch from the backend: https://jsfiddle.net/hbezwsvb/8/   I want to trigger getUsername() periodically... something like a correct version of this: https://jsfiddle.net/quu9onay/    Any hint?
[11:16:31] <VeryBewitching> sigdk: setTimeout?
[11:16:47] <twg_> taplar_: thanks
[11:20:04] <sigdk> VeryBewitching, hmm, yeah, I miss the "periodically" part
[11:21:51] <sigdk> hmm, it's actually setInterval
[11:28:25] <Hackwar1> hi folks, I need to find out what the attached handlers to an object are. The handler is attached via jQuery and I read that jQuery(elem).data("events") would return that, but it doesn't. Anybody got a hint for me?
[11:34:15] <VeryBewitching> sigdk: Yes, you're correct.  My web development brain is pretty old.
[11:53:12] <digglr> hello, I'm having a bit of issue with a ternary statement, I have a function that returns a string and its producing undefined whereas the console displays it, I've reproduced the same bit of code here: https://jsfiddle.net/thy87x57/1/
[12:16:29] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/thy87x57/2/
[12:18:32] <digglr> taplar_, thank you
[12:37:24] <LeBlaaanc> what's the proper way to get the current selections href? $('[data-append-hash-href]').attr('href', $(this).attr('href') + window.location.hash);
[12:37:41] <robertmaxrees> gotta use .each() for that.
[12:37:42] <LeBlaaanc> wrap in function to fix that?
[12:38:46] <robertmaxrees> no - gotta use $('[data-append-hash-href]').attr(
[12:38:47] <LeBlaaanc> robertmaxrees nope just needed to wrap in function
[12:38:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:39:01] <robertmaxrees> oh, so attr takes a function.
[12:39:03] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[12:39:11] <LeBlaaanc>     $('[data-append-hash-href]').attr('href', () => $(this).attr('href') + window.location.hash);
[12:39:23] <LeBlaaanc> it scopes in the element as this
[12:39:28] <robertmaxrees> that seems odd.
[12:39:30] <LeBlaaanc> oh wait
[12:39:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:39:37] <robertmaxrees> try a normal function.
[12:39:40] <robertmaxrees> since fat arrows can't bind.
[12:39:47] <robertmaxrees> so $(this) doesn't work the way it should.
[12:40:10] <LeBlaaanc> what are you suggesting?
[12:40:27] <LeBlaaanc> $('[data-append-hash-href]').each(function () { ... })
[12:40:27] <LeBlaaanc> ?
[12:41:05] <robertmaxrees> you can use normal functions with what you had.
[12:41:24] <LeBlaaanc> so this $('[data-append-hash-href]').attr('href', function() { return $(this).attr('href') + window.location.hash }); ?
[12:41:40] <robertmaxrees> no return.
[12:41:56] <LeBlaaanc> uh
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> isn't needed.
[12:42:16] <robertmaxrees> also: $(this).attr('href') + window.location.hash is wrong.
[12:42:36] <robertmaxrees> $(this).attr('href', $(this).attr('href') + window.location.hash);
[12:43:13] <LeBlaaanc> only thing that works is this $('[data-append-hash-href]').attr('href', function() { return $(this).attr('href') + window.location.hash });
[12:43:15] <LeBlaaanc> you have to return
[12:43:17] <LeBlaaanc> it's a callback
[12:43:26] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's right.
[12:43:29] <robertmaxrees> still thinking of .each()
[12:43:33] <robertmaxrees> you got it :)
[12:43:44] <robertmaxrees> caffeine hasn't kicked in yet hahaha
[12:51:41] <royalty> so
[12:51:47] <royalty> to bind events to hidden elements
[12:51:52] <royalty> would .on be the way to go?
[12:52:00] <robertmaxrees> for all even handling, yeah
[12:52:02] <robertmaxrees> *event
[12:52:21] <royalty> but it would bind the event even if the element was hidden?
[12:52:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:52:31] <robertmaxrees> still in the DOM
[12:52:36] <royalty> ok
[12:52:48] <robertmaxrees> if the element doesn't yet exist, then you have a different hurdle.  but a very easy one to fix.
[12:53:14] <taplar_> you can bind event handlers to elements if they are in the dom or not, so long as you have a reference to them
[12:54:53] <Uhkis> someone should really create a web page to explain delegation well and add it to the topic
[12:55:14] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:55:15] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:55:33] <robertmaxrees> if you find those are lacking, you're more than welcome to submit PRs to change them :)
[12:56:05] <taplar_> we just need our bot back for quick linkage
[12:57:45] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: more like we need TL;DR version of those
[12:57:53] <robertmaxrees> i had the api doc url memorized at one point hahaha
[12:58:00] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis the issue is that people still won't read it.
[12:58:07] <Uhkis> no wonder, it's clearly the most asked question here
[12:58:18] <robertmaxrees> it's a quick read as-is, and an important one to understand fully.
[12:58:23] <taplar_> i have api.jquery.com/jQuery.whatever as my first url entry usually
[12:58:41] <robertmaxrees> people just skip to the examples and think that using .on() at all == delegation.
[12:58:50] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:58:57] <Uhkis> i like http://www.jqapi.com/
[12:59:33] <taplar_> neat
[13:00:13] <Uhkis> taplar_: and fast!
[13:05:42] <royalty> so
[13:05:48] <royalty> I don't think I'm understanding this right
[13:05:51] <royalty> https://jsfiddle.net/vn3c9unt/4/
[13:05:58] <royalty> I'm trying to get the console log to show
[13:06:06] <royalty> when I click on the a.share-link
[13:06:13] <royalty> they are hidden at first but certainly in the dom
[13:07:01] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[13:07:17] <royalty> yeah
[13:07:18] <taplar_> i see the console log
[13:07:21] <royalty> linked it a bit up there
[13:07:23] <royalty> you do?
[13:07:26] <taplar_> yep
[13:07:34] <robertmaxrees> i wasn't here.  woops.
[13:07:47] <royalty> strange
[13:07:55] <royalty> https://jsfiddle.net/vn3c9unt/4/
[13:08:06] <royalty> maybe it's a matter of my console acting wonky...
[13:08:48] <royalty> so when you click on it you do in fact see the console log?
[13:08:54] <taplar_> yep
[13:08:55] <robertmaxrees> i do.
[13:09:05] <taplar_> 'it'
[13:09:06] <royalty> yeah, I'll have to figure out what's wrong with my firefox console...
[13:09:07] <taplar_> ?
[13:09:40] <taplar_> are you looking for the console log for the button or the three links?
[13:10:08] <royalty> three links
[13:10:16] <taplar_> then yep
[13:10:18] <royalty> i just want to be sure that something happens when i am clicking them
[13:10:25] <royalty> sweet, yeah there is this logging tab
[13:10:33] <royalty> for some reason i thought the logs would show up in my js tab
[13:10:40] <royalty> geez
[13:12:57] <royalty> thanks guys
[13:51:21] * taplar_ would kill for some air flow in his little cubicle
[13:51:46] <duch_kazatel> i had a cube like that at one point.
[13:51:52] <robertmaxrees> never was a fan.
[13:52:34] <taplar_> it's that time of the year where it's in that state where you're just always uncomfortable.  coat off/on all the time just trying to fix it
[13:52:55] <robertmaxrees> i just finally brought in a fan and called it a day.
[13:52:58] <taplar_> can't wait for the floor redesign to happen
[13:53:04] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: the amount of pun in that is unbearable :D
[13:53:14] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:53:15] <taplar_> we got one, but it's more for our pairing station that i'm not sitting at any longer
[13:53:19] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[13:55:35] <Uhkis> taplar_: what does coat on/off all the time mean?
[13:55:57] <taplar_> you know where you are a little chilly so you put on a coat, but then are too hot, so you ...
[13:56:43] <jak2000> hi all
[13:56:44] <Uhkis> taplar_: so like every spring when it's -16C in the morning and +10C in the afternoon? =)
[13:57:10] <taplar_> dunno.  our fan says it's 77 in here
[13:57:51] <Uhkis> what's 77 in human degrees?
[13:57:59] <jak2000> i add a TextArea, the user add lines.... my question is how to count line numbers?
[13:58:02] <taplar_> 77F i think that one is
[13:58:12] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that question makes almost no sense lol
[13:58:27] <jak2000> ok i rephrase
[13:58:29] <taplar_> jak2000: split by \n and count?
[13:58:42] <robertmaxrees> oooooh i missed "line" in there.
[13:58:42] <jak2000> i want to know how many number of lines have a textarea in event onkeypress or keydown?
[13:59:01] <robertmaxrees> and hrm... that's a toughie - lines can wrap without a newline char.
[13:59:48] <Uhkis> actual lines is probably $('textarea').val().split('\n').length
[14:00:06] <jak2000> wich event is better? on key down?
[14:00:08] <robertmaxrees> wonder if that works on windows.
[14:00:19] <robertmaxrees> could use input jak2000
[14:01:00] <jak2000> input and add to textarea?
[14:01:12] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:01:33] <jak2000> accept the data in the input, and then when user hit ENTER key add to text area?
[14:02:06] <robertmaxrees> so they're typing in an input and then you want to append that to a textarea?
[14:02:18] <jak2000> yes, is your advice for me?
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd use keydown and check the keycode in that case.
[14:03:16] <Uhkis> sounds like a really weird usecase
[14:03:42] <Uhkis> why don't they just type in the textarea?
[14:03:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:03:51] <robertmaxrees> or not use a textarea at all?
[14:05:38] <robertmaxrees> gotta list of entries it seems like.
[14:05:46] <robertmaxrees> so you could just count the number of LIs in a UL.
[14:07:59] <taplar_> i think he's asking if you are suggesting he use an input, not that he is using an input
[14:08:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm already lost then >.>
[14:09:36] <taplar_> jak2000: got a fiddle showing what you have and anything that you've tried so far?
[14:09:48] <Uhkis> mind reading: the #1 skill of it support personnel
[14:13:32] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:17:27] <taplar_> "i want this!"  you really want this!
[14:17:35] <taplar_> <3
[14:36:34] <jak2000> taplar_ ok
[14:45:26] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/5619/   not detect the enter key :(
[14:45:35] <jak2000> error
[14:45:38] <jak2000> bad fiddle
[14:47:28] <jak2000> done: http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/5620/
[14:47:35] <jak2000> detected enter how to count?
[14:48:16] <taplar_> try getting the value and .split("\n").length
[14:49:09] <taplar_> though you are preventing default if the key is enter, which is kinda weird
[14:49:16] <jak2000> bad?
[14:49:29] <taplar_> if the user is just typing, how could they create new lines?
[14:49:43] <taplar_> why are you doing the prevent?
[14:50:33] <taplar_> also a change/blur are possibly going to duplicate the logic execution
[14:50:41] <taplar_> and would never be a enter key code
[14:51:34] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/5622/
[14:51:36] <jak2000> better?
[14:51:59] <taplar_> try 'input' instead of 'keyup'
[14:52:36] <taplar_> i think pasting also triggers the input event
[14:52:44] <taplar_> but that's testable
[14:52:49] <jak2000> console.log("Enter Pressed "+value or line);
[14:52:51] <jak2000> how to?
[14:53:11] <taplar_> so now try the split thing i suggested
[14:54:52] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/5626/
[14:54:54] <jak2000> :(
[14:55:18] <taplar_> length isn't a method
[14:55:29] <taplar_> it's an attribute of an array
[14:55:45] <taplar_> ['a', 'b', 'c'].length == 3
[15:02:24] <taplar_> looks like the which isn't set on the event
[15:02:36] <taplar_> dunno if that is due to it being a delegate or what
[15:10:00] <taplar_> aaaah, it has to do with input
[15:10:08] <taplar_> it's not setting the keyCode for input
[15:10:58] <taplar_> so yeah, if you want the logic to only happen on an enter key you'll have to use keydown/keypress/keyup
[15:11:20] <taplar_> though that leaves out if the user changes the value by pasting
[15:11:30] <taplar_> but maybe you want that.  *shrug*
[15:12:20] <json-help> I'm trying to loop through my json array, but have to split up certain sections (based on category). Any ideas how I could start pulling this info if I use an AJAX request? https://jsfiddle.net/yn4t5bun/
[15:13:55] <Es0teric> if i have list elements and they have anchors that get the class .reacted on click... but i only want one to have a .reacted per every list within a <ul> how would i make that happen?
[15:14:02] <jak2000> taplar_: http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/5629/
[15:14:18] * taplar_ has stolen the group fan
[15:15:04] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/5630/  without alert
[15:32:31] <taplar_> Es0teric: remove the class from all of them before you put it on the new one
[15:32:48] <taplar_> in whatever context (the ul) is needed
[15:33:26] <Es0teric> so in the beginning of the click .removeClass)
[15:33:40] <taplar_> yep
[15:33:50] <Es0teric> interesting
[15:33:59] <taplar_> if you want to get fancy you can check if the element clicked already has the class to short circuit not doing any work
[15:35:39] <Es0teric> taplar_ that one i am not sure of
[15:35:51] <Es0teric> since its inside of a <a> thats inside of a <span> which is inside of an <li>
[15:36:25] <taplar_> if ( element that will get the class already has the class ) { do nothing } else { do work }
[15:37:00] <Es0teric> taplar_ nahhh
[15:37:02] <Es0teric> that might not work
[15:42:33] <uskerine> hi, is it possible with revolution slider to do something on each slide transition? I would like to change the color of some menus depending on the slide that it is currently being shown
[15:43:24] <Es0teric> taplar_ actually that did work.. i did this: $(this).closest('ul').find('a').removeClass('reacted');
[15:47:23] <taplar_> you might also do $(this).closest('ul').find('a.reacted').removeClass('reacted')
[15:51:27] <taplar_> json-help: are you saying you want the ajax to pull just part of the json?
[16:13:50] <Sandlayth> hello guys
[16:14:15] <Sandlayth> i've a module which load a content from a db with $.post
[16:14:46] <Sandlayth> this module is initialized at $(document).ready, thus the content should be retrieved at that moment
[16:15:43] <Sandlayth> the fact is that it's supposed to fill elements, but, if i understand well, the variable which store the db content isn't set yet at the fill function call
[16:15:59] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth sounds like you're not waiting for the ajax call to finish.
[16:16:24] <Sandlayth> yes, that's exactly what i think too
[16:16:31] <Sandlayth> my question is:
[16:16:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing you're doing something like var myData = {}; $.ajax({ success: function(data) { myData = data}); console.log(myData);
[16:16:59] <Sandlayth> how to know, from another module, how to know when the call is finished to call the fill function at this time?
[16:17:10] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways.
[16:17:23] <robertmaxrees> gotta invert your reasoning a bit though.
[16:17:43] <robertmaxrees> can do $.ajax().then(theFillFunction);
[16:18:06] <Sandlayth> hum
[16:18:27] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you can do myAjaxCall = $.ajax(); then later do myAjaxCall.then(theFillFunction);
[16:18:28] <Sandlayth> indeed, it totally invert my reasioning ^^"
[16:18:38] <DelphiWorld> hey everyone
[16:18:45] <Sandlayth> which way is the cleanest?
[16:18:51] <DelphiWorld> i have a select element like this:
[16:19:05] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth kind of depends on what the rest of your code looks like.  They're basically the same thing.
[16:19:08] <DelphiWorld> <select id="playlist">
[16:19:16] <robertmaxrees> just a code organization thing Sandlayth
[16:19:26] <Sandlayth> thanks a lot ^^
[16:19:28] <DelphiWorld> and trying to handle it like so: $('#playlist').on('change', function() {
[16:19:41] <DelphiWorld> but the event isn't firing
[16:19:49] <taplar_> change happens after blur
[16:19:53] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:19:57] <DelphiWorld> :P
[16:20:30] * DelphiWorld code is there: https://dpaste.de/3bSX
[16:20:38] <jak2000> DelphiWorld you develop with Delphi?
[16:20:52] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld also - does the element exist when you do the binding?
[16:21:10] <taplar_> please tidy your code man
[16:21:13] <DelphiWorld> Robdgreat: i think yes, its loaded in the header
[16:21:29] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: i am just a hobyist dude... i wish i'm a developer ;(
[16:21:41] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld still would help you a lot to format it well.
[16:21:41] <taplar_> jsfiddle.net, stick your code in there, click tidy
[16:21:48] <robertmaxrees> though, iirc, aren't you blind DelphiWorld?
[16:21:54] <robertmaxrees> or was that someone else?
[16:21:58] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: yes,  i am blind
[16:22:18] <robertmaxrees> either way, DelphiWorld do console.log($('id="playlist"]').length) before you bind that listener - what do you get?
[16:22:27] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: jsfiddle make me dumb..., not friendly with screen reader...
[16:22:34] <taplar_> ah
[16:23:01] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: where you want me to do that line?
[16:23:09] <robertmaxrees> before you bind that handler.
[16:24:08] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees, Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: id="playlist"]
[16:24:33] <robertmaxrees> woops - console.log($('[id="playlist"]').length)
[16:25:15] <DelphiWorld> ok, robertmaxrees: Log0
[16:25:21] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[16:25:24] <robertmaxrees> the element doesn't exist yet.
[16:25:45] <DelphiWorld> so what should i do?
[16:25:50] <DelphiWorld> load the scrypt at the botum?
[16:25:58] <robertmaxrees> what creates that element?
[16:26:04] <DelphiWorld> html
[16:26:06] <DelphiWorld> declared
[16:26:45] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're binding outside of the document ready
[16:26:53] <robertmaxrees> all that stuff should be in there.
[16:27:03] <DelphiWorld> ah, all that should be inside!
[16:27:09] <DelphiWorld> even the binding?
[16:27:13] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:27:19] <robertmaxrees> can't bind to it unless it exists.
[16:27:25] <DelphiWorld> lol no
[16:27:28] <DelphiWorld> now i have log 1
[16:27:32] <robertmaxrees> then it should work.
[16:27:34] <Sandlayth> robertmaxrees: are they some conditions for using then? like returning something? cause i get a "undefined function" for the function which call then
[16:27:42] <DelphiWorld> because i put the scrypt at the botum
[16:27:47] <Sandlayth> : Pizza.init(...).then is not a function
[16:27:49] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth show your code.
[16:28:06] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you're already using a document ready there...
[16:28:11] <robertmaxrees> why not just be consistent?
[16:28:12] <Sandlayth> http://sprunge.us/iHEO
[16:28:22] <Sandlayth> http://sprunge.us/iHEO?js
[16:28:27] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: yes i'll move it inside
[16:28:44] <Sandlayth> i'm modulizing it, don't really end it
[16:28:48] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i thought the document ready is only fired when the page is completed and the binding is outside
[16:29:00] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld nope.
[16:29:10] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you either stick your script at the bottom or use document ready.
[16:29:50] <DelphiWorld> still not handling robertmaxrees
[16:29:52] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth you want .list.then()
[16:29:57] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld share code again?
[16:30:33] <Sandlayth> list is an array, not a reference to a function
[16:30:43] <robertmaxrees> erm...
[16:30:45] <Sandlayth> then could be used on other objects than functions?
[16:31:02] <Sandlayth> sorry, didn't want to annoy you :/
[16:31:05] <robertmaxrees> ah - you need to reformat your code.
[16:31:19] <Sandlayth> tell me, i really care about this
[16:31:21] <robertmaxrees> loadList.then()
[16:31:31] <robertmaxrees> err, loadList().then()
[16:31:42] <robertmaxrees> oh weird, you
[16:31:49] <robertmaxrees> *you have that setList function call already.
[16:31:50] <robertmaxrees> same idea as that.
[16:31:59] <robertmaxrees> just a different spin on it.
[16:32:34] <Sandlayth> i've thought about this
[16:32:40] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees, js: https://dpaste.de/bGJC html: https://dpaste.de/V8RM
[16:32:45] <Sandlayth> but it'sn't going to run the function twice?
[16:32:53] <DelphiWorld> i know my code is stupid... but let's see
[16:32:57] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth huh?
[16:32:59] <Sandlayth> once in the init function
[16:33:05] <robertmaxrees> i'
[16:33:41] <Sandlayth> tell me if i need to refactor my code, i begin in js and surely don't understand well how the module pattern is formed
[16:33:56] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth ah you're using a module pattern.  i really gotta get better about reading code first LOL
[16:34:15] <Sandlayth> i didn't apply it everywhere
[16:34:24] <Sandlayth> yet
[16:34:26] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld dunno what to tell you - that should work.
[16:34:34] <DelphiWorld> yes...
[16:34:44] <DelphiWorld> dont you think the problem is with the mobile angular ui?
[16:35:03] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld no idea - i don't use angular.
[16:35:11] <taplar_> isn't radio.pause and radio.load methods?
[16:35:14] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to ask in an angular channel for help withthat.
[16:35:17] <Sandlayth> it was sarcastic, btw?
[16:35:22] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth huh?
[16:35:31] <Sandlayth> was it
[16:35:34] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: yes methods, called up on the select change
[16:35:36] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth was what?
[16:35:43] <taplar_> they are missing the () on them then
[16:35:53] <Sandlayth> the fact that you didn't notice the module pattern implementation
[16:36:09] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth i scan code really quickly for problems - i forget to check things like that.
[16:36:21] <Sandlayth> i understand
[16:36:42] <Sandlayth> well, thanks
[16:36:42] <robertmaxrees> either way, rioght now you're using init to set a property to the return of loadList, which also calls setList.
[16:36:47] <robertmaxrees> like, this is kind of strangely put together.
[16:36:53] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: fixed
[16:37:00] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: now the issue is the select not handling...
[16:37:03] <Sandlayth> huhu
[16:37:35] <Sandlayth> i thought it was a clean way to do it
[16:37:50] <taplar_> DelphiWorld: is it still console logging the 1?
[16:37:53] <Sandlayth> argh
[16:37:58] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: yep
[16:38:01] <robertmaxrees> eh.  I'd just expose loadList(), get rid of setList, and chain .then() from there.
[16:38:02] <Sandlayth> init function is useless
[16:38:13] <taplar_> ok, so put a console.log inside the handler and see if that prints out
[16:38:13] <Sandlayth> yes, you're right
[16:38:16] <Sandlayth> totally
[16:38:47] <DelphiWorld> i am putting alert taplar_ ;)
[16:38:57] <taplar_> prefer console.log instead
[16:39:04] <robertmaxrees> ^ alert halts page execution.
[16:39:04] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: crap... fixed
[16:39:25] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: the issue was the mediaelement was stoping scrypt execution!
[16:39:47] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees:  see the player initialisation... lol
[16:39:47] <taplar_> eh?
[16:39:53] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: see
[16:40:00] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld i closed the window with your code.
[16:40:19] <taplar_> i don't really know anything about that media element
[16:40:20] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees, taplar_ https://dpaste.de/hNVH
[16:40:22] <DelphiWorld> now its fixed
[16:40:44] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:41:31] <taplar_> the load in your success method is still missing the ()
[16:42:03] <taplar_> also move that radio var into your doc ready to scope it down
[16:51:50] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: is my code clean now?
[16:53:06] <taplar_> share code?
[16:53:25] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: the last one, except of the var and load method
[16:53:33] <DelphiWorld> i fixed both of them
[16:53:48] <DelphiWorld> i will run it in my phone now using cordova
[16:53:49] <Sandlayth> huhu
[16:54:09] <Sandlayth> k, jquery don't consider Pizza.loadList() as a function
[16:54:12] <Sandlayth> wth
[16:54:21] <robertmaxrees> show your code?
[16:54:30] <Sandlayth> sure
[16:54:32] <robertmaxrees> and that's not a jQuery problem fwiw.
[16:54:38] <taplar_> DelphiWorld: looks fine, though I personally would store the playlist element in a variable so you only have to look it up once
[16:55:01] <Sandlayth> idk, i see ".Deferred exception: Pizza.loadList(...) is undefined ..." so i think it's a jquery problem
[16:55:05] <Sandlayth> i'm a simple human :/
[16:55:11] <robertmaxrees> show code
[16:55:19] <Sandlayth> http://sprunge.us/jQie
[16:55:21] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: explain the playlist var please?
[16:55:21] <Sandlayth> http://sprunge.us/jQie?js
[16:55:32] <DelphiWorld> you mean the playlist handler?
[16:55:44] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth you're not returning anything there.
[16:55:47] <Sandlayth> line 138 the important snippet
[16:55:49] <Sandlayth> ah
[16:55:52] <robertmaxrees> return $.post(
[16:55:54] <taplar_> you can do var $playlist = $('#playlist');  and then just use $playlist in all the places you are doing the selector
[16:55:57] <Sandlayth> so i've to return something
[16:56:09] <DelphiWorld> ah...
[16:56:10] <DelphiWorld> easy
[16:56:14] <DelphiWorld> will do it and share
[16:56:14] <Sandlayth> AH
[16:56:21] <Sandlayth> I finally understand
[16:56:45] <robertmaxrees> still a js thing ;)
[16:56:53] <Sandlayth> thanks robertmaxrees, indeed, then check a variable in the object returned by post, right?
[16:57:02] <Sandlayth> 'hen'
[16:57:10] <Sandlayth> '.then'
[16:57:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:57:23] <robertmaxrees> .then(function(data) { console.log(data) });
[16:57:52] <Sandlayth> hum
[16:57:57] <Sandlayth> data is void :/
[16:58:01] <robertmaxrees> errr
[16:58:02] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:58:08] <robertmaxrees> where's the data coming from then?>
[16:58:09] <Sandlayth> nope
[16:58:18] <Sandlayth> sorry, i don't say it well
[16:58:26] <Sandlayth> i'm mean, it's an empty array
[16:58:33] <Sandlayth> instead of a filled one
[16:58:37] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:58:39] <robertmaxrees> what "fills" it?
[16:58:53] <Sandlayth> with some test values from a db
[16:58:57] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:59:02] <robertmaxrees> that's what you'll get in the .then()
[16:59:26] <robertmaxrees> .then(function() {}); is like that function you're passing into $.post
[17:00:20] <DelphiWorld> taplar_: done: https://dpaste.de/raDx
[17:00:41] <Sandlayth> ah
[17:00:54] <Sandlayth> it changes everything
[17:01:26] <taplar_> DelphiWorld: line 18
[17:01:46] <Sandlayth> but, in this case, my list property is useless, isn't it?
[17:01:54] <DelphiWorld> lol
[17:01:57] <DelphiWorld> i missed it :P
[17:03:31] <DelphiWorld> jquery making my life easyer :-P
[17:16:08] <Sandlayth> robertmaxrees: the 'then' method force me to call loadList each time i want to retrieve db items, right?
[17:20:17] <Sandlayth> ah, i just have to use .done
[17:20:31] <Sandlayth> thanks for showing me the path, robertmaxrees ^^
[17:22:38] <robertmaxrees> Sandlayth use .then()
[17:23:07] <robertmaxrees> .then(function() {}) and .done(function() {}) do the same thing for what you're doing.
[17:24:11] <Sandlayth> .done function let me access self.list once it's set in $.post, in opposition to .then, if i understood well?
[17:26:02] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ -> "Incorporates the functionality of the .done() and .fail() methods [...]"
[17:26:53] <Sandlayth> yes, maybe it's a cleaner way
[17:27:03] <Sandlayth> thanks for being patient :|
[17:27:39] <robertmaxrees> .then() is the one that's compliant with Promises/A+ - also: why do you need to refer back to anything?  Just use the data that comes from the server >.>
[17:28:57] <Sandlayth> i thought that loading the request in a list could be efficient insofar as i refresh the list often in the page
[17:29:10] <robertmaxrees> wait wait wait.  back up.
[17:29:15] <robertmaxrees> so you need to re-run the ajax call?
[17:29:35] <Sandlayth> that's what i think, am i wrong?
[17:29:48] <robertmaxrees> does its data change from call to call?
[17:30:06] <Sandlayth> argh
[17:30:10] <Sandlayth> you're right
[17:30:14] <robertmaxrees> ah, because you're sending data and then getting stuff back.
[17:30:15] <robertmaxrees> right?
[17:30:21] <Sandlayth> yep
[17:30:29] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you do need to re-run it.
[17:30:37] <Sandlayth> yes, ofc
[17:31:12] <Sandlayth> so my list var is useless
[17:31:15] <Sandlayth> actually
[17:31:15] <robertmaxrees> var myAjaxCall = function() { return $.ajax() }; then you can just myAjaxCall.then(function(data) { console.log(data) });
[17:31:20] <Sandlayth> yep
[17:31:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you don't need it.
[17:31:26] <Sandlayth> thanks ^^
[17:45:54] <uskerine> Is it possible to detect when a <li> item changes its visibility attribute to "inherit"?
[17:50:33] <taplar_> there isn't a jQuery method for that
[17:51:01] <uskerine> I am trying to do something everytime a slider changes its slide
[17:51:13] <robertmaxrees> what carousel are you using?
[17:51:16] <uskerine> I have noticed that it sets hidden  or inherit to visibility in a <li>
[17:51:29] <uskerine> revolution slider
[17:54:17] <robertmaxrees> https://www.themepunch.com/revsliderjquery-doc/api-methods-events/#events
[17:54:18] <robertmaxrees> use these.
[18:02:05] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[18:04:26] * taplar_ starts singing the you got to learn when to hold 'em song
[18:53:59] <uskerine> thanks robertmaxrees
[18:54:01] <uskerine> it works
[19:09:00] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeee
