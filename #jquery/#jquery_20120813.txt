[00:02:16] <tehcyx> coldhead: http://pastebin.com/7wBKmGCw this is some of the code
[00:03:07] <Bauer> anyone? alert($.fn.jquery) I get 1.3.2 - is that the loaded jquery?
[00:03:29] <tehcyx> everything works till i call processAfterDone(), how can i call it in this case?
[00:03:52] <coldhead> Bauer: you should be seeing 1.7.2, somewhere else you must be loading an older version of jQuery
[00:03:56] <coldhead> stop that happening
[00:04:38] <coldhead> tehcyx: it MIGHT be this.processAfterDone()
[00:04:50] <zapsoda> ok well im getting somewhere thanks to you ENQ =) i found the resize function but it still looks really wierd and can i put the resize function and the ready function in one script tag like i did here: and my site ishttp://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/
[00:04:53] <coldhead> i can't tell with that weird inheritance you got going on there
[00:05:34] <coldhead> tehcyx: or Test.processAfterDone() might be the trick
[00:06:16] <zapsoda> i forgot to give link after "here:"
[00:06:17] <zapsoda> http://pastebin.com/gQujB02Z
[00:07:16] <tehcyx> coldhead: nope both don't work.. problem is iam in an anonymous function.. is there a way to use a non anonymous function? tried .done(processSms) but didn't work either
[00:07:54] <tehcyx> .done(processAfterDone) for the sample
[00:08:18] <coldhead> i'll show you a gross way to fix it
[00:09:04] <tehcyx> looking forward to this
[00:09:45] <coldhead> tehcyx: http://jsfiddle.net/yF2rK/
[00:10:00] <coldhead> the better way is to learn how to access methods when you're using that weird base extends stuff
[00:10:14] <r500> any idea when i click directory categories and then next button adn when again i try to click directory categories ; it does not slideup http://graffitisys.com/clients/goenche/index.php?id=2
[00:10:57] <mazzachre> OK, so $.wrap[All]() does not work on not yet added elements... $('<h1>Moo</h1>').wrapAll('<div class="cow"/>').appendTo('body'); does not append the div with class cow only the moo...
[00:11:02] <tehcyx> thanks i'll give that a try
[00:11:07] <coldhead> good luck tehcyx
[00:11:39] <coldhead> mazzachre: wrapAll() doesn't return the wrapping element
[00:11:56] <coldhead> wrapAll('whatever').parent().appendTo('body') might work
[00:12:07] <coldhead> i can't remember
[00:12:19] <coldhead> or you can append and then do the wrap
[00:12:21] <coldhead> that might work better

[00:14:47] <azbyin> $(document).keydown(function(){ ... });
[00:15:02] <azbyin> how would I unbind only this handler?
[00:16:01] <coldhead> you would bind it with a namespace and unbind that
[00:16:15] <coldhead> $(document).bind('keydown.aids', ...
[00:16:26] <coldhead> $(document).unbind('keydown.aids')
[00:16:26] <tw2113> oh aids
[00:16:37] <mazzachre> coldhead: Ah ok... I though it returned itself like almost anything else in jquery... Oh well, I did the opposite, $('#farm').html('<h1>Moo</h1>'); $('#farm').children.wrapAll('<div class="cow"/>');
[00:16:55] <zapsoda> how do you do a alert in jquery? Alert($(window).height())   wont work :(
[00:17:24] <azbyin> zapsoda, alert() still works!
[00:17:27] <coldhead> lowercase alert()
[00:19:13] <zapsoda> thank you
[00:19:33] <zapsoda> using alert i found why it wasnt working ENQ
[00:20:00] <ENQ> cool

[00:25:33] <tehcyx> coldhead: thanks look way better but processAfterDone is not in window namespace :-/ Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Window] has no method 'processAfterDone'
[00:26:12] <tehcyx> i'm about to write an e-mail to the Base.js author if he encountered this problem before
[00:26:37] <coldhead> that lib is 6 years old
[00:26:42] <coldhead> he probably doesn't remember doing it
[00:26:50] <coldhead> it's not very javascripty
[00:27:09] <tehcyx> but i could use that inheritance
[00:27:26] <tehcyx> going for a cofffee
[00:27:49] <tw2113> i'm going to bed once Neverland is done
[00:27:51] <coldhead> good idea
[00:34:49] <r500> any idea when i click directory categories and then next button adn when again i try to click directory categories ; it does not slideup http://graffitisys.com/clients/goenche/index.php?id=2
[00:35:19] <r500> please need  urgent help on it.
[00:35:30] <r500> thanks for help in advance
[00:38:40] <coldhead> r500: it looks like when you click Next that replaces the dropdown icon with a new identical icon
[00:38:53] <coldhead> except the identical icon doesn't have any JS bound to it
[00:38:55] <r500> yes it does using ajax
[00:39:02] <coldhead> so it doesn't know it should close when you click it
[00:39:24] <coldhead> so you can EITHER change the way your AJAX loads to only replace the links, not the title and icon and everything
[00:39:33] <r500> but the code that i am loading on jax is same
[00:39:34] <coldhead> OR you can use on() when you assign your event handlers
[00:39:51] <coldhead> so they'll still work even when you add/remove applicable elements later
[00:40:57] <r500> but the same coe works quite well over here http://www.goenche.com/
[00:41:34] <coldhead> well why don't you copy their code
[00:41:37] <coldhead> if it works so well
[00:41:47] <r500> even simple ajax alert is not working on ajax load on http://graffitisys.com/clients/goenche/index.php?id=2.
[00:41:59] <r500> yeah its same code. only thing layout been updating
[00:42:24] <coldhead> you should be able to fix your site by changing jQuery("#directory").click(function () { to jQuery(document).on('click', '#directory', function () {
[00:42:56] <r500> same ajax code and same index code for directory listing. its surprising if i put function onclick of id="directory" it does not even alert
[00:43:26] <coldhead> i explained why it isn't working
[00:43:46] <coldhead> and how you might fix it
[00:43:51] <coldhead> everything is going to be okay
[00:44:08] <r500> ohh .. ok thanks.. i saw  the code above just now
[00:44:14] <r500> will give it a try
[00:46:12] <tw2113> oh coldhead always so helpful
[00:46:19] <coldhead> QUIET YOU
[00:46:25] <coldhead> :D
[00:46:39] <r500> coldhead:  i tried the code but still no success. i had tried using live() too
[00:46:40] <tw2113> why must you curse yourself with knowledge
[00:46:50] <tw2113> people start assuming you know what you're doing
[00:47:27] <coldhead> live() really should work
[00:47:33] <r500> it doesnt
[00:47:48] <tw2113> console errors?
[00:48:22] <coldhead> you'll have to try the more painstaking but more sensible fix of replacing JUST the table and not the whole div
[00:48:29] <r500> <div align="left" style="cursor:pointer;" id="directory" onclick ="alert_function()"> then alertfunction is also not getting called
[00:48:46] <coldhead> and if you can do it without telling me that it works on some other site i'll give you a lollypop
[00:55:15] * r500 kisses coldhead and pours beer in glass  for him :)
[00:55:47] <r500> thanks you so much coldhead .. u made my day.. wish u become richer than bill gates
[00:55:50] <r500> :) :P
[00:56:01] <coldhead> my pleasure, r500
[00:56:09] <coldhead> best wishes

[01:02:29] <natrixnatrix89> Hi huys.. If I have an element with overflow: scroll
[01:02:29] <natrixnatrix89> how do I get the height of it's contents? because if I use height() I get the height of the element.. But what I need is to get the scrollable content..
[01:02:29] <natrixnatrix89> does it mean I have to add another container for that?
[01:02:55] <natrixnatrix89> and then query that container instead?
[01:03:15] <natrixnatrix89> Isn't there a way to do that without adding the contaiener?
[01:04:56] <r500> may be you will have to get num of characters in content and then based on stringlength u can check how much height does  so.. many characters require
[01:05:33] <natrixnatrix89> nope
[01:06:02] <r500> or put it in hidden div and get the content?
[01:06:08] <coldhead> natrixnatrix89: i believe you need either the bogus extra container OR to render it offscreen without overflow:hidden and with margin-left:-999999em and test the height there :(
[01:06:26] <natrixnatrix89> yeah. I agree, coldhead..
[01:06:53] <coldhead> overflow harshes buzzes nearly as bad as iframes do
[01:07:44] <natrixnatrix89> so overflow: hidden and absolute positioning and some artifficial scrollbars would be better?
[01:07:48] <natrixnatrix89> I don't think so..
[01:08:01] <natrixnatrix89> I think scrolling is faster than absolute positioning
[01:09:55] <Tee_Pee> 'ello
[01:10:30] <Tee_Pee> I have a rather annoying issue with Jquery mobile, partially because it feels like it's something stupidly simple, but I can't seem to get it.
[01:11:59] <Tee_Pee> The gist is this - I have a button via <a data-role=button and in my CSS I say .ui-btn-up-themeName { background: bg1 }     .ui-btn-hover-themeName, .ui-btn-down-themeName { background: bg2 }
[01:12:18] <Tee_Pee> However, once I touch the button in the app (android), the second background sticks
[01:12:24] <Tee_Pee> it doesn't "pop back up" to bg1.
[01:13:55] <tw2113> http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug/firebug-tip-log-dom-events/
[01:15:28] <Tee_Pee> unless Firebug has an android version I really don't see how that is relevant.
[01:15:39] <Tee_Pee> The buttons works fine in my browser.
[01:15:55] <tw2113> it's not relevant to your issue
[01:15:59] <tw2113> i was just sharing :D
[01:16:07] <Tee_Pee> Right-o.
[01:27:05] <mazzachre> Why does this not work? http://jsfiddle.net/QWcW8/ I get an empty object back from echo?!
[01:28:06] <hooloovoo> mazzachre: what does echo give you?
[01:28:10] <hooloovoo> brainfart
[01:28:18] <hooloovoo> i mean the ajax response
[01:28:19] <planet_en> Can anyone help me, whats wrong with thishttp://jsfiddle.net/najamkhn/rMNRk/
[01:28:36] <planet_en> sorry, link again.. http://jsfiddle.net/najamkhn/rMNRk/

[01:30:58] <boulet101010> mazzachre: have you tried to check if url /echo/json is good?
[01:31:37] <mazzachre> boulet101010: That is what I am trying... but I am basically using their own example...
[01:31:45] <boulet101010> lol
[01:31:51] <planet_en> @boulet101010: I dont see any difference.. how come its working now
[01:31:55] <planet_en> or am I missing something?
[01:32:06] <boulet101010> just check the braces right ^_^
[01:32:17] <boulet101010> compare your code with mine
[01:32:34] <boulet101010> in URL you need to have a file that exists and that will send you data back
[01:32:43] <boulet101010> it's the principles of ajax
[01:33:10] <boulet101010> so /echo/json should be a file on a server
[01:33:21] <planet_en> boulet101010: if I have a console.log in one of the functions like bb, it execute twice, any idea why?
[01:34:35] <boulet101010> remove the two braces at the end
[01:35:09] <jarco> http://www.google.com/trends/?q=mootools,+jquery&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0
[01:35:13] <zapsoda> http://pastebin.com/i63v8Lwz
[01:36:06] <mazzachre> boulet101010: /echo/json/ is defined in jsfiddle as function that returns the json data you give it... yet it does not, it returns an empty object for some reason...
[01:36:08] <planet_en> boulet101010: but if i have document.ready inside it, and im not invoking the function, it part of cc object, how is it being invoked anyway?
[01:36:46] <boulet101010> true
[01:38:44] <fgro> a question regarding the "immediately-invoked" function: (function($) { ... }(jQuery);  <-- When precisely is this function called? My problem: i'm defining a callback in the function. When I make a ajax get call and get the result, the function is invoked again, resulting in "multiple" adding of callback.
[01:38:46] <boulet101010> http://jsfiddle.net/rMNRk/13/ planet_en
[01:38:55] <boulet101010> so everything is loaded as document.ready
[01:40:48] <planet_en> boulet101010: yes but I want to wrap it around to use the (function($, window){))(jquery, window) pattern
[01:41:44] <boulet101010> don't know about this pattern, but what's your goal?
[01:42:07] <planet_en> boulet101010: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5305634/jquery-question-what-does-it-really-mean/5305786#5305786
[01:42:40] <planet_en> boulet101010: if incase $ is in use by someother library
[01:43:07] <tcial> How do I make my code more efficient, and better in general?
[01:43:16] <tcial> I would like some tips
[01:44:04] <tcial> Currently, I think my code is atrocious
[01:44:41] <boulet101010> mazzachre: i'm checking your problem right know
[01:45:21] <boulet101010> planet_en: but what's the exact goal? launching the function when document is ready?
[01:46:01] <Jennifer23> Hi, how to get pop up box in jquery?
[01:46:10] <planet_en> boulet101010:  I think fgro: is probably having the same issue..
[01:46:45] <planet_en> Jennifer23: no pop up in jquery, we got modals
[01:47:54] <planet_en> boulet101010: ah, nevermind..
[01:48:01] <boulet101010> never? :))
[01:48:05] <planet_en> figured it out
[01:48:15] <planet_en> my bad
[01:48:20] <boulet101010> nice!
[01:49:58] <fgro> so bascially my question is why does the $.get function invoke the Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)?
[01:50:13] <fgro> an ajax json call that is
[01:50:47] <hooloovoo> fgro: explain
[01:50:52] <boulet101010> mazzachre: kinda strange
[01:51:07] <planet_en> fgro: are you doing getScript?
[01:51:08] <hooloovoo> fgro: Where does it do that?
[01:51:17] <boulet101010> never tried to handle ajax in jsfiddle, but why you don't do it locally?
[01:53:27] <fgro> hooloovoo: ok i'm not sure if the $.get is the true source. but let me explain. i'm loading my page, the IIEF define an on click callback on some link. the on the page i perform a ajax call to load additional data. upon success of that call, the IIEF is triggered again, resulting in additional attachment of callback on the link (which is bad for my app).
[01:54:14] <fgro> so i'm trying to understand when IIEF is actually executed
[01:54:28] <zapsoda> is there a syntax error in: $("#main").css("height", $(window).height()-$("#header").height()-$("#footer").height()-50px);
[01:54:42] <fgro> and why it's executed as a result of my get() request
[01:55:15] <bjensen> What is the alternative to .on that is less resource intensive? I don't need future elements..
[01:55:23] <NodeX> delegate
[01:55:31] <bjensen> isn't delegate deprecated?
[01:55:34] <NodeX> and on() is not that resource intensive
[01:55:36] <boulet101010> zapsoda: have you tried to remove the "px" at the end?
[01:55:54] <zapsoda> no but i feel stupid
[01:56:01] <zapsoda> its a interger the whole time
[01:56:02] <bjensen> nodeX, well it has to look for future elements as well, doesn't it..
[01:56:03] <NodeX> or use the normal handlers
[01:56:17] <bjensen> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method"
[01:56:24] <bjensen> normal handlers?
[01:56:37] <NodeX> click?
[01:56:40] <NodeX> hover?
[01:56:43] <bjensen> submit
[01:56:51] <NodeX> boom +1 cookie
[01:58:03] <fgro> never mind, i figured out the problem. my fault.
[01:58:19] <some_dude> anyone knows why jquery google maps is at war with jquery datatables?
[01:59:54] <mazzachre> boulet101010: It takes ages to put something on our servers because it needs to be confirmed by a team leader (I am just a consultant) So I use jsfiddle to test out stuff while I am working on it, so I don't need to bother someone with 1000 updates and wait 1000 times 5minutes a day... (adds up :D)
[02:04:10] <hemangpatel> I applied one datepicker on one text field of web application
[02:05:01] <hemangpatel> But i want to prevent opening iphone keypad while click on that text field..
[02:05:10] <hemangpatel> is it possible ?
[02:09:39] <Jennifer23> how to add color for text field, when input is wrong?
[02:11:08] <boulet101010> mazzachre: so suggest that json is working anyway and just create a function that sends you a json object back
[02:11:20] <boulet101010> or create a server on your machine
[02:11:57] <Somatt> is there a way to get element.width() in rem unit instead of px ?
[02:14:23] <JavaNinja> weird question but I want to just duplicate an existing image instead of creating it multiple times....
[02:14:39] <JavaNinja> so that way when it loads once the user can see it displayed like 100 times
[02:15:07] <JavaNinja> i take it copy will work nevermind my question
[02:15:39] <zapsoda> any idea why this isnt working?
[02:15:39] <zapsoda>          $(window).resize(function() {
[02:15:40] <zapsoda>             $("#main").css("height", $(window).height()-$("#header").height()-$("#footer").height()-75);
[02:15:40] <zapsoda>             $("#main").css("height", $("#main"));
[02:15:40] <zapsoda>          });
[02:15:46] <zapsoda> sorry not pastbin
[02:15:48] <JavaNinja> or clone if you will
[02:16:05] <Jennifer23> sorry, i've find it
[02:16:25] <JavaNinja> yes zapsoda
[02:16:33] <JavaNinja> I don't see a px specification
[02:16:44] <zapsoda> ohh
[02:16:46] <JavaNinja> so you have height,123
[02:16:58] <JavaNinja> bu tthat's just first guess lemme know ok
[02:17:03] <zapsoda> it should be }.height at end
[02:17:20] <JavaNinja> maybe but I still don't know if those would include px
[02:17:29] <faraway> zapsoda: px is the default so this should not be the problem
[02:17:35] <JavaNinja> when I do stuff like that I generally parseInt() and then add px
[02:17:36] <zapsoda> $("#main").css("height", $("#main").height);
[02:17:51] <JavaNinja> oh ok listen to faraway as I was trained in javascript
[02:17:53] <zapsoda> right now it was grbbing the div i forgot to say grab height of div
[02:18:00] <JavaNinja> and idk how jquery handles stuff
[02:18:03] <Jennifer23> how to in its text field(not exit ), when input is wrong?
[02:18:22] <JavaNinja> mm ic
[02:18:36] <JavaNinja> Jen
[02:18:43] <JavaNinja> can you ask ur question again I was absnet
[02:18:45] <JavaNinja> absent*
[02:19:11] <seutje> as of 1.6, you can use '+=75px' in .css() values
[02:19:27] <JavaNinja> seutje that is awesome!!
[02:19:30] <seutje> like $('#main').css('height', '+=75px');
[02:19:44] <JavaNinja> sweet
[02:19:50] <seutje> then u don't have to repeat your selector
[02:23:18] <faraway> zapsoda: what is not working in your case ?
[02:23:34] <zapsoda> i madde a new paste of what i have
[02:23:35] <zapsoda> http://pastebin.com/7bQxdxFN
[02:23:51] <zapsoda> i want to make the siebar be the size of the main
[02:24:07] <zapsoda> the height of the sidebar be the height of the main
[02:25:06] <faraway> zapsoda: you need to call .height() …. not .height
[02:25:50] <zapsoda> thank you very much
[02:26:21] <faraway> zapsoda: http://jsfiddle.net/tMkdt/1/
[02:26:44] <tehcyx> when i use .done() after an ajax call, and want to call a function, let's say .done(callFunction); can i pass arguments to callFunction? if yes, how?
[02:27:16] <mazzachre> Really interesting observation with jsfiddle and /echo/json/ The delay parameter works just fine, but the object to echo does not... Is there a problem with their documentation?

[02:31:30] <hooloovoo> jammsen: umm, that's what jquery does. just do your thing
[02:31:49] <hooloovoo> jammsen: if $(".widget") isn't found it won't do what comes after.
[02:32:16] <jammsen> yeah but which function?
[02:32:44] <jammsen> just if($('.widget')) { code }
[02:32:47] <hooloovoo> jammsen: jsut do $(".widget").whateveryouwannado(function() { //this won't happen if .widget isn't found });
[02:32:52] <jammsen> or do i have to count or something
[02:32:57] <hooloovoo> no
[02:33:46] <hooloovoo> jammsen: you you wanna check it somewhere else you can do if ($(".widget").length < 1) // .widget wasn't found
[02:34:49] <platzhirsch> If I simply want to read a text file into a variable is it the best way to use $.get and read the responseText from the returning object?
[02:34:53] <jammsen> so i have to use: if ($(".widget").length > 1) { do getjson request }
[02:35:19] <hooloovoo> platzhirsch: depends, but yea.
[02:35:42] <hooloovoo> jammsen: it's kinda messy to do that, but yea. it would work.
[02:36:32] <seutje> don't really have to use > 1 or anything like that
[02:36:33] <jammsen> hooloovoo: i need to check because i minify all my js, and the widget.js tries to get data for the widget div, but sometimes the div isnt there
[02:36:41] <seutje> 0 == false, 1 == true
[02:36:57] <seutje> so if ($('.foo').length) {} suffices
[02:37:20] <seutje> it'll never return a string or anything that could fuck with your type coersion
[02:37:26] <hooloovoo> jammsen: i'd recomend not calling the widget script unless it's needed, but checking the length works.
[02:37:27] <seutje> unless some bastard fucked with your prototype
[02:37:44] <zapsoda> any ideas what wrong with this line lol
[02:37:45] <zapsoda> $("#sidebar-content").css("margain-top", $("#sidebar").height()-$("#sidebar-content").height()-50);
[02:37:49] <seutje> margain?
[02:38:14] <Jennifer23> how can i set could't exit text field when the input is wrong?
[02:38:17] <seutje> and looks like your setting the height to a regular number without a unit
[02:38:45] <seutje> not sure if it works properly without a unit like 'px' or '%' or something
[02:39:07] <zapsoda> itsim trying to set margin-top to height of sidebar - sidebar-content
[02:39:12] <faraway> zapsoda: probably margain-top if you really wrote this in your code ;)
[02:39:38] <seutje> probably a good use-case for using a function
[02:39:49] <zapsoda> i acctuly did write this lol
[02:39:58] <zapsoda> but i see i spelled margin-top wrong
[02:39:59] <zapsoda> ty
[02:41:48] <benjick> Hey. I have a function within a function, but this doesn't allow me to use $(this). What's a good way to solve this?
[02:43:11] <faraway> benjick: e.g. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/  or just the javascript closure feature
[02:45:21] <faraway> zapsoda: anyway without a sample with html it is hard to guess what is not working
[02:47:29] <zapsoda> ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout
[02:47:44] <zapsoda> but its "kinda" working now
[02:47:49] <benjick> faraway: Thanks. That looks advanced though
[02:47:56] <benjick> I'll get on it! Cheers
[02:48:20] <zapsoda> idk that i should have done it in JS i think i could have done it in CSS somehow
[02:48:49] <benjick> The code in question: http://pastebin.com/jnVzPtxf
[02:50:26] <Tee_Pee> buttons in jquery mobile are the absolute worst.
[02:50:55] <Tee_Pee> Is there actually a way to do "fast buttons" with 1.1.1?
[02:52:17] <faraway> benjick: i suggest that you learn javascript scopes
[02:52:48] <faraway> benjick: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/yjgzA/
[02:54:05] <faraway> benjick: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/yjgzA/1/
[02:54:53] <MeirD> Is it possible to use the animate() method to move an element to a specific destination such as a certain div id, instead of using the left and top attributes?
[02:55:54] <benjick> faraway: Thank you. I will look into scopes.
[02:56:12] <benjick> is proxy recommended over "self"?
[02:56:26] <faraway> benjick: you really should, scopes and closures
[02:56:41] <benjick> Cheers
[02:56:49] <faraway> benjick: depends on the situstion
[02:57:13] <faraway> benjick: sometimes it is clearer wif you write 'var whatEver = this;'
[02:57:31] <faraway> benjick: sometimes its clearer if you can continue to use the this statment
[02:57:46] <benjick> I see
[02:58:05] <benjick> Thank you for taking your time. I really appreciate it

[02:58:52] <Snozberry> hello all
[03:04:56] <nanicoar> Hello, I'm trying to user
[03:05:00] <nanicoar> asdf
[03:06:15] <nanicoar> use .load() to send a string to a server, but the data field seems to only want a map eg. somethingA=somethingB, and when I set somethingA to null it still sends =somethingB
[03:06:36] <nanicoar> I wish to only send somethingB. Can you help?
[03:07:04] <NodeX> eh?
[03:07:30] <NodeX> key=value and you just want to send key?
[03:07:35] <NodeX> foo?key
[03:07:43] <nanicoar> I want to send only value.
[03:08:03] <NodeX> foo?=value
[03:08:29] <NodeX> like that? ^^
[03:08:45] <nanicoar> I'm not familiar with ? syntax.
[03:08:55] <NodeX> err wtf lol
[03:09:05] <NodeX> do you mean like ... foo?=value
[03:09:06] <nanicoar> I just want to send a single string. The contents of a variable.
[03:09:24] <NodeX> explain how in a NORMAL url stucture
[03:10:55] <nanicoar> $("#id").load("https://portal..com/...Link.aspx #Table", b)
[03:11:24] <NodeX> you need to construct your url yourself to do it
[03:11:36] <NodeX> load("http://foo?somethingB");
[03:11:55] <nanicoar> hmm
[03:12:16] <nanicoar> It's a POST, not a GET.
[03:12:26] <NodeX> unlucky
[03:12:31] <NodeX> can't be done
[03:13:25] <Snozberry> Anyone that might be able to help me with a newbie question?  I'm trying to create a form that dynamically updates a total of selected checkbox values.  I am able to add my values up whenever a new chkbox is checked, but I am drawing a blank on how to remove a value when that particular checkbox is unchecked.  Anyone point me in the right direction?
[03:14:06] <Tee_Pee> why don't you just use an XMLHTTPRequest?
[03:14:15] <Tee_Pee> you can do post with that.
[03:14:20] <NodeX> lol
[03:14:32] <NodeX> what do you think load() is Tee_Pee ?
[03:14:45] <Tee_Pee> Sorry, haven't been keeping up with the entire discussion, just got here lol
[03:15:23] <nanicoar> NodeX: That's not true.
[03:15:43] <NodeX> how is it not true?
[03:15:47] <zapsoda> Hi how can i make the div #sidebar-content be at the bottom of the div #sidebar? ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout
[03:16:19] <zapsoda> JS or CSS either way
[03:16:23] <nanicoar> I'm looking at the raw transmission data. I need to get rid of a preceeding = in the data that is sent to the server.
[03:16:25] <juha_> ?post @ Tee_Pee
[03:16:26] <bot-t> Tee_Pee, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[03:16:43] <NodeX> nanicoar : you CANNOT send json with value and no KEY it's illegal and invalid JSON
[03:16:55] <Tee_Pee> Yeah, I know what post is.
[03:16:56] <NodeX> and the "b" part of your example is a JSON object
[03:17:02] <Tee_Pee> or rather, jQuery.post
[03:17:07] <nanicoar> I'm not trying to send JSON.
[03:17:12] <NodeX> OMG
[03:17:28] <NodeX> the JSON object is mapped to key=value when doing the request
[03:17:42] <NodeX> either do it with GET or you can't do it
[03:17:59] <nanicoar> http://www.pasteall.org/34467
[03:18:06] <nanicoar> this is what I send.
[03:18:14] <nanicoar> the ... are omissions
[03:19:01] <nanicoar> as you can see, I send =EVENT ..., I want to send EVENT ... .
[03:21:09] <nanicoar> BTW, that's with my key being null.
[03:24:21] <nanicoar> I check my traffic using Fiddler2, so I know this is what is actually sent to the server. The server listens for a POST that is not JSON, but rather some other arbitrary standard.
[03:26:50] <subhojit777> I want to change the top right property of an absolute element(div) dynamically so that it is generated just below a textbox, no matter wherever the textbox is positioned.
[03:27:28] <nanicoar> or then again at some point one of my text editor decided the thing to do is substitute = for %3D%26-_-
[03:27:53] <nanicoar> *editors
[03:32:51] <Sicp> I want to generate the contents an HTML page, I am doing that by using jQuery to read an XML file; when I am done with that, do I load the script in the body of my HTML page?
[03:33:13] <Sicp> I am not including the <html> till <body> tags in the script
[03:35:50] <nanicoar> Sicp: I think you can put the jquery in the <head> and then append the <body> from there.
[03:36:19] <Sicp> ok
[03:38:16] <NodeX> nanicoar : YOU cannot do what you want to do with jquery
[03:38:21] <NodeX> it's as simple as that
[03:38:38] <nanicoar> NodeX: That's wrong too.
[03:38:53] <some_dude> can someone tell me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/zlikowsky/phBjD/6/
[03:38:55] <NodeX> if you can prove that
[03:38:59] <NodeX> then that's all good
[03:39:47] <seutje> some_dude: gmap.js is returning HTML code instead of javamascripts
[03:39:56] <seutje> gmap3.js *
[03:40:08] <some_dude> seutje, any way to make it work?
[03:40:16] <seutje> link to the raw
[03:40:32] <seutje> or don't link straight to github
[03:40:40] <some_dude> hm
[03:40:47] <endberg> hi
[03:40:53] <some_dude> seutje, what do you mean by raw?
[03:41:13] <nanicoar> What I now need to do is either stop something along my pipe from substituting = and & with %3D and %26, or use whatever data structure is required.
[03:41:32] <seutje> some_dude: https://raw.github.com/jbdemonte/gmap3/master/gmap3.js instead of https://github.com/jbdemonte/gmap3/blob/master/gmap3.js
[03:41:38] <endberg> I'd like to know, if my selector is right: http://jsfiddle.net/JEYr2/
[03:41:51] <some_dude> seutje, thanks I'll try that
[03:42:14] <some_dude> seutje, what's the difference btw?
[03:42:21] <LordThumper> Hi, is it possible to get all event handlers attached to an element?
[03:42:22] <seutje> click on it
[03:42:32] <seutje> some_dude: one is an html page, the other is plain text source of the js
[03:42:42] <some_dude> seutje, still doesn't work
[03:42:54] <some_dude> damn it
[03:42:54] <NodeX> nanicoar : the jquery function maps a JSON object to KEY=VALUE parameeters
[03:43:01] <seutje> yeah, just noticed that, but at least I'm not getting an illegal token error
[03:43:12] <NodeX> evidently you think you know more about this than me so good luck ;)
[03:43:15] <faraway> LordThumper: currently it is still possible but you should not do this. why do you need this ?
[03:43:40] <LordThumper> Just for debug purposes
[03:43:50] <seutje> some_dude: that load handler is never called
[03:44:55] <some_dude> seutje, the tabs do actually load, you saying the load event is not triggered?
[03:44:56] <LordThumper> I tried $(ele).data("events")
[03:45:06] <faraway> LordThumper:  http://blog.jquery.com/ search for : $(element).data(“events”)
[03:45:06] <nanicoar> NodeX: I have engineered data to specs before. This may be different, but then again it's different every time. You may not like what I have to do to make it work, but your discouragement isn't welcome.
[03:45:18] <LordThumper> It doesn't work
[03:45:20] <seutje> some_dude: yeah, look, no "holla" in the console: http://jsfiddle.net/phBjD/9/
[03:45:43] <faraway> LordThumper: so you use 1.8 right ?
[03:45:48] <LordThumper> oh
[03:45:51] <LordThumper> no 1.7.2
[03:46:01] <faraway> LordThumper: there it should still work
[03:46:05] <LordThumper> .data("events") returns undefined
[03:46:07] <some_dude> seutje, yea just did the same .) in my browser it does trigger tho. dunnoo whats wrong
[03:46:24] <tehcyx> can i use $.proxy within .done(); ? i mean like $.ajax.done($.proxy(this, 'someFunc')); i need to pass the context to the function called by done :-/
[03:46:33] <seutje> some_dude: for this fiddle? odd
[03:46:39] <some_dude> seutje, i mean in my local code. not the fiddle.
[03:47:00] <LordThumper> Ok, I had the wrong selector, it works thanks
[03:47:28] <faraway> LordThumper: anyway in the blog there is also the way for 1.8 described with more infos
[03:48:01] <LordThumper> Ah thanks
[03:49:00] <seutje> some_dude: yeah... no clue why it isn't firing though
[03:50:37] <some_dude> seutje, anyway the fiddle is not even the point. Im drawing the google map in my code and only the left upper corner of it gets drawn, if I try tot scroll the map, the rest of the map just dissapears. however when I turn on firebug everything starts working correctly. the rest of the map gets drawn and I can scroll np O_O
[03:51:11] <seutje> some_dude: no clue dude, I tend to avoid gmaps
[03:51:40] <Somatt> is it possible to have two sets of tabs for the same content in jquery ui ? i.e. top tabs and bottom tabs for the same content
[03:51:46] <endberg> Please help me with this selector: http://jsfiddle.net/JEYr2/1/
[03:51:52] <twinturbo> hey, noob question. $(ready) is fired after all scripts have been loaded or ?
[03:52:07] <tehcyx> twinturbo: when the DOM is ready
[03:52:42] <faraway> seutje, some_dude: isend the load : just for ajax driven tabs content ?
[03:53:05] <jonno11> hey - I have a list of items I'm applying an effect to like (for instance) $('li').hide(); when I then add an element after DOM load, that selector (for obvious reasons) doesn't include it. Is there a way of binding the selector to each and every future element?
[03:53:26] <faraway> isend  = isn't ^^
[03:53:39] <some_dude> faraway, you're right, I shoul've used 'create'
[03:53:52] <NodeX> nanicoar : as I said you think you know best so good luck. I am telling you wiht 100% accuracy that you CANNOT do what you want with POST without hacking the jquery core
[03:53:53] <some_dude> faraway, still the gmap doesn't work :/
[03:54:08] <some_dude> faraway, http://jsfiddle.net/zlikowsky/phBjD/10/
[03:54:15] <NodeX> so again best of luck and I will love for you to prove me and my umpteen years of experience wrong
[03:54:28] <nanicoar> NodeX: mmhmm
[03:54:31] <faraway> some_dude: Uncaught ReferenceError: google is not defined
[03:57:13] <some_dude> faraway, so it's not loading some js properly. meh, I'm giving this up, it's not even the bug I'm trying to show :)
[03:57:19] <twinturbo> tehcyx: any way to get an event when all initial scripts have been downloaded?
[03:57:56] <faraway> some_dude: hehe ;) google maps is always a little bit messy
[04:04:48] <Sicp> $("document").ready(function(){ <-- Firefox says that this is "not well-formed"?
[04:05:04] <LordThumper> $(function () { });
[04:05:21] <quicksilver> Sicp: not until you finish it with });, indeed it isn't
[04:05:29] <Sicp> it is finished with that, yes
[04:05:42] <quicksilver> it's perfectly well-formed.
[04:05:48] <LordThumper> and
[04:05:51] <mazzachre> Sicp: $(document) not $("document") it is not a literal but an object
[04:05:51] <tehcyx> twinturbo: sorry, i don't know
[04:05:51] <LordThumper> its $(document)
[04:05:57] <quicksilver> it's buggy (you don't want quotes around "document")
[04:06:02] <Sicp> it was $(document) before this error
[04:06:05] <LordThumper> just write it like $(function () { })
[04:06:06] <quicksilver> but that won't give a not-well-formed error from FireFox
[04:06:29] <Sicp> http://pastebin.com/ft7APrU7 here it is
[04:06:31] <tehcyx> twinturbo: nvm it is $(window).load(function() {});
[04:06:47] <twinturbo> tehcyx: which is different than ready ?
[04:07:08] <tehcyx> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012140/delaying-a-jquery-script-until-everything-else-has-loaded as of this, yes
[04:07:11] <tehcyx> first answer
[04:08:19] <faraway> twinturbo: depends how you load the scripts if you load them with getScript, you need to use the callbacks there, to get informed when the are loaded
[04:08:37] <faraway> twinturbo: oherwise the scripts are executed in the order the are in the html code
[04:10:28] <quicksilver> Sicp: looks fine to me, can't see any reason firefox wouldn't like it at first glance.
[04:11:32] <faraway> twinturbo: so you don'T really need an event if you want to know if the scripts that are included via the html code are all leaded
[04:11:38] <faraway> loaded
[04:11:41] <Sicp> when referring to a tag and not an attribute while using .appendTo(), do I say .tag?
[04:11:55] <Sicp> I want everything.appendTo(thebody)
[04:12:06] <LordThumper> tag = element?
[04:12:10] <Sicp> element
[04:12:31] <LordThumper> $("elementSelector").appendTo("body")
[04:12:58] <Sicp> yea that's basic selectors, thanks
[04:13:55] <Sicp> strange, I see nowhere in my script that I ever mention index.html, although inside index.html I am calling this script inside the body
[04:14:03] <Sicp> but in the script I cannot just say "body", what "body"
[04:14:43] <LordThumper> $("body") returns all "body" elements
[04:14:55] <LordThumper> like $("div") returns div elements in the document...
[04:15:03] <Sicp> there are no body elements in my XML (which is the file I started the ajax call
[04:15:13] <Sicp> the ajax call for)*
[04:15:31] <LordThumper> The script is in the .html right?
[04:15:37] <Sicp> I want to grab the elements *page and such* from the XML and then append it to the html
[04:16:25] <LordThumper> Just GET the XML using Ajax, then use your selectors on the data returned..
[04:16:50] <Sicp> yes but where do I mention that "throw it there in the html"?
[04:17:03] <LordThumper> Let me see your script
[04:17:43] <LordThumper> something like
[04:18:33] <LordThumper> $.ajax({ ... success: function(data) { $(body).append($(data).find("foo").text()) } ... })
[04:19:16] <LordThumper> "data" would be the XML contents
[04:20:12] <LordThumper> oh and $("body"), my mistake
[04:20:20] <tehcyx> coldhead: you here?
[04:22:52] <tehcyx> where can i find the parameters passed to $.ajax().fail() ?
[04:24:50] <LordThumper> error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[04:24:54] <LordThumper> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:25:13] <juha_> tehcyx: http://bit.ly/NkzJt0
[04:25:28] <LordThumper> oh seems error is deprec in 1.8
[04:25:40] <tehcyx> juha_: thanks
[04:26:03] <tehcyx> but that won't give me more information that i already have
[04:26:55] <mazzachre> LordThumper: Where do you see that $.ajax({error: function}); is deprecated?
[04:27:16] <LordThumper> jqXHR, textStatus i think tehcyx
[04:27:30] <mazzachre> LordThumper: Oh... found it... thx
[04:27:41] <LordThumper> "The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callbacks will be deprecated in jQuery 1.8. "
[04:27:53] <LordThumper> ok
[04:28:23] <tehcyx> .fail(function(xhr, error, status) { 			console.log(arg1); 			console.log("--------"); 			console.log(arg2); 			console.log("--------"); 			console.log(arg3); 		});  gave me Object   error  Bad Request so i assume its xhr, error, status
[04:29:09] <tehcyx> LordThumper: thanks, already found out myself
[04:33:24] <jonno11> hey - I have a list of items I'm applying an effect to like (for instance) $('li').hide(); when I then add an element after DOM load, that selector (for obvious reasons) doesn't include it. Is there a way of binding the selector to each and every future element? (A bit like $.on() but doing things other than events)
[04:35:58] <pifantastic> jonno11: if you need to hide new dom elements, I would just make sure the new dom elements have a class that you can display: none
[04:36:13] <tehcyx> why is $.ajax().fail() called even if i get a status 200 response?
[04:36:21] <pifantastic> jonno11: presumably if you can programmatically add a DOM element, you can also give it a class
[04:36:27] <jonno11> pifantastic: .hide() was just an example
[04:36:45] <pifantastic> jonno11: there are DOM mutation events, but those are only supported in a few browsers
[04:36:53] <jonno11> hmm ok
[04:37:01] <jonno11> I have a list of li elements
[04:37:09] <jonno11> and I'm iterating through them
[04:37:17] <jonno11> fading them in and out one by one
[04:37:39] <jonno11> But they're tweets, so they will be updating...
[04:38:26] <vrodic> document ready seems to fire too early on IE 9 and 10 on latest 1.8.0
[04:38:41] <vrodic> i'm trying to provide a test case, but my minimal test still works
[04:39:47] <pifantastic> jonno11: if you're cycling through tweets, I don't see why it would matter that new ones are getting added
[04:39:47] <Cork> vrodic: that would be a browser bug if that was the case
[04:39:57] <Cork> vrodic: not much jquery can do about it
[04:40:20] <vrodic> Cork, i'm not sure what exactly triggers it, it works in jquery 1.7.2
[04:40:48] <Cork> vrodic: $(document).ready is the event DOMContentLoaded
[04:41:04] <Cork> vrodic: pre ie9 it doesn't exist so there its just plain load
[04:41:36] <Cork> vrodic: so, are you sure you want ready and not .load?
[04:42:41] <vrodic> Cork, it worked in jquery 1.7.2, there are some objects initialized after the document ready block that are used in document  ready
[04:42:59] <vrodic> Cork, this case works on 1.8.0 on most browsers, but not on IE 9/10
[04:43:50] <jonno11> because there will be new li elements
[04:44:02] <jonno11> I guess I could replace the content...
[04:44:52] <Cork> vrodic: sounds like you have a race condition; you should restructure the code so you don't have something that expects ready to delay a specific amount of time
[04:45:16] <LordThumper> jonno11: If you reapply the selector, jQuery will get new elements too
[04:45:41] <jonno11> hmm yeah. But I'm using angular UI binding.
[04:46:01] <vrodic> Cork, i'm not sure, i can work arround the bug if i place the object initialization before the document ready block, but i suspect it is a regression in 1.8.0 so i'm trying to create a minimal test case for it
[04:50:47] <jonno11> so I don't have control over how the element is added
[04:50:59] <jonno11> I just need a listener, listening for new elements :/
[04:52:20] <klj613> with select2. how do i reset/clear the values?
[05:26:21] <seutje> it's all.... so quiet
[05:26:29] <seutje> dum, tadadadum tadadadum
[05:26:34] <seutje> it's all... so still
[05:27:01] <seutje> it's al peaceful until... TADADADA!
[05:27:08] <hooloovoo> that's a good thing in here. means people know jquery now.
[05:27:19] <seutje> true
[05:27:25] <seutje> and Björk is the shit!
[05:29:29] <abletony84> The "revealing module pattern" talked about at http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/javascript-best-practices/ - I get it it's good for snippets that have global variables.
[05:29:33] <abletony84> But what about stuff like $(".some-div").each(function() { $(this).delay(5000).slideUp("fast"); }); - ought it to be wrapped inside the var someName = function() { }(); goodness too?
[05:30:14] <boulet101010> you can : $(".some-div").delay(5000).slideUp("fast");
[05:31:48] <seutje> really no reason to .Each there
[05:31:58] <abletony84> cool
[05:32:05] <abletony84> thanks for the tip
[05:32:15] <abletony84> so no need to wrap that up in one of those module pattern things then?
[05:33:29] <endberg> hi
[05:33:32] <enbergj> is there a "cleaner" way to do $('form')[0].reset(); ? .. it feels a bit stupid having to have the [0] there for it to work
[05:33:39] <boulet101010> (you see seutje i learned from your advices ;))
[05:33:58] <seutje> abletony84: well, if it's part of a big component, I would advise wrapping it in a namespace
[05:34:31] <seutje> abletony84: but that's more for when you're defining variables and stuff
[05:35:12] <endberg> Please, tell me if this selector is correct, and changes the second li item's img source? $("ul#list1 li:eq(1) img").attr('src', 'newimage.jpg');     (http://jsfiddle.net/JEYr2/2/)
[05:36:18] <pifantastic> endberg: yes, that works
[05:36:26] <endberg> thanks
[05:36:39] <seutje> eq works in selectors? :o
[05:36:42] <seutje> kewl
[05:37:03] <pifantastic> endberg: you can use .get(0) if you want to
[05:37:10] <pifantastic> but it's essentially the same thing
[05:37:30] <keithclarkcouk> isn't it best to avoid :eq in selectors?
[05:38:02] <keithclarkcouk> replacing it with :nth-child will allow sizzle to use native querySelectorAll
[05:41:48] <abletony84> seutje: yup, it is part of a big application.js - but it doesnt have any variables so.. is it safe to let it be as it is?
[05:42:01] <abletony84> stuff with variables i've wrapped in a namespace as you call it though
[05:42:04] <DireFog> is it normal that $.ajax requests become part of the browser history? Stepping back into a JSON one-liner isn't the UX I was aiming for :-/
[05:42:09] <seutje> abletony84: well, it should probably be in your init
[05:42:39] <seutje> keithclarkcouk: while we're on the topic: ul#list1 should just be #list1 :P
[05:45:31] <keithclarkcouk> seutje: true
[05:49:21] <faraway> DireFog: no it should not
[05:49:56] <DireFog> faraway: Firefox 10 does, at least Sometimes™ :-/
[05:50:17] <peterschmidler> How can I fadeIn an object after the fadeOut of the previous has ended, bc the delay and timing doesn't seem very accurate?
[05:50:27] <DireFog> luckily I can just use a POST with _method=GET in Rails
[05:51:06] <faraway> DireFog: i would guess it is something else, never saw such a behavior for ajax requests
[05:51:19] <DireFog> me neither
[05:51:47] <DireFog> I'll nuke the entire session, maybe it still remembers the async:true that was in there 50 reloads ago
[05:52:58] <DireFog> onpe, doesn't help
[05:54:36] <faraway> DireFog: do these urls only appear in the back button history ?
[05:55:14] <DireFog> faraway: ooooh, idea
[05:55:29] <DireFog> the URL for the AJAX request is the same as the page URL itself
[05:55:48] <DireFog> so I guess that nukes Firefox's idea of caching
[05:56:26] <faraway> DireFog: if you don't send the correct varying header then yes
[05:56:43] <DireFog> it's different content types
[05:57:20] <faraway> DireFog: http://mark.koli.ch/2010/09/understanding-the-http-vary-header-and-caching-proxies-squid-etc.html
[05:58:24] <faraway> DireFog: if the url is exaclty the same then you either need a vary header depending on the browsers request headers or you always run into the problem that the wrong content could be displayed
[05:58:44] <DireFog> ah thanks
[05:59:05] <DireFog> seems exceedingly broken though that the content type doesn't figure in by default
[05:59:06] <faraway> DireFog: especially if there are caching proxies e.g. in companies
[06:00:35] <DireFog> faraway: it's broken in the browser though, I don't even see a request, it just clobbers its internal state.
[06:01:22] <DireFog> oh well, I'll just set vary to include it globally, thanks again
[06:01:46] <faraway> DireFog: i would not say broken, its more the expected caching behavior
[06:01:50] <abletony84> seutje: sorry my init?
[06:02:10] <seutje> abletony84: or whatever function you're using to initialize the application
[06:03:12] <faraway> DireFog: i think Vary could work, but probably to avoid browser bugs, i wouldn't rely on it.
[06:03:21] <peterschmidler> Is there a smarter way of doing a fadeout and fadein, because this causes timing problems? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/kFGcK
[06:03:42] <DireFog> explicitly appending the extension to the URI path works too
[06:05:59] <peterschmidler> Forget my last question, it seems to work fine now. But how can I make an infinite loop out of it? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/kFGcK
[06:08:47] <peterschmidler> Anyone, please?
[06:10:52] <ravenzz> styling jquery mobile is a nightmare
[06:10:56] <faraway> peterschmidler: all jquery animation function have a callback method that are called as soon as the animation is finished
[06:11:10] <ravenzz> :|
[06:11:23] <peterschmidler> faraway: Ah, thanks.
[06:11:23] <faraway> peterschmidler: with this callback you can create an infinite loop
[06:15:14] <abletony84> seutje: hmmm.. dont believe i got one of those..
[06:18:00] <abletony84> ravenzz: made some progress on your thing last night thanks to ak: jsfiddle.net/abletony84/84prM/
[06:18:03] <abletony84> im so proud
[06:18:57] <abletony84> jquery mobile huh.. can't wait to climb that mountain :/
[06:19:49] <abletony84> gasping for oxygen, altitude sickness
[06:24:10] <peterschmidler> Still trying to get the infinite loop running, but it seems I can't reference a function from it'S own callback, right. What would be an appropriate workaround? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/kFGcK
[06:25:23] <ravenzz> abletony84 use links instead of submit buttons
[06:25:43] <ravenzz> you don't want submit the form after the 1st step, but at the end i guess
[06:28:27] <pifantastic> peterschmidler: you can definitely reference a function from its own callback
[06:29:20] <pifantastic> peterschmidler: so you're trying to cycle through the elements, fading each one in and then out?
[06:29:32] <peterschmidler> pifantastic: yes
[06:30:27] <peterschmidler> pifantastic: And at the end restart with the first one. Actually I am trying to crossfade them...
[06:31:22] <jmaister> peterschmidler: Maby using nextOrFirst would be easier http://www.mattvanandel.com/999/jquery-nextorfirst-function-guarantees-a-selection/
[06:31:44] <peterschmidler> jmaister: OK, thanks.
[06:33:34] <pifantastic> peterschmidler: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/szfhF
[06:34:04] <peterschmidler> pifantastic: Great!
[06:34:08] <mazzachre> Does this seem fine? (Other than needing to be wrapped so I don't depend on global $) http://jsfiddle.net/RD9sE/30/
[06:36:31] <peterschmidler> pifantastic: One last thing, if you mind. How would a crossfade look like. Should be easy (for you) ;)
[06:39:12] <pifantastic> peterschmidler:  https://codepen.io/anon/pen/szfhF
[06:41:44] <peterschmidler> pifantastic: You're the greatest, but why does it break if I ad a position: fixed; ? https://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/FipAx
[06:42:19] <pifantastic> peterschmidler: those elements have no width
[06:42:21] <quaker_> How do I detect whether a tag has a css property set?
[06:42:28] <pifantastic> it doesn't break, they're just 0 pixel wide divs
[06:42:51] <peterschmidler> pifantastic: Yes. thanks, man!
[06:43:55] <quaker_> For example: a div has color:#000. An inner div has no color set (so it's inherited from the outer div). How do I get the inner but not the outer?
[06:44:39] <pifantastic> quaker_: http://api.jquery.com/css/#css1
[06:44:48] <peterschmidler> pifantastic: Where would I put the delay if I wanted a pause?
[06:45:04] <quaker_> pifantastic: it returns #000 for the inner div.
[06:45:29] <pifantastic> quaker_: which is correct
[06:45:39] <quaker_> but not what I am looking for
[06:46:23] <peterschmidler> pifantastic: I solved it: https://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/FipAx
[06:47:03] <pifantastic> :D
[06:47:13] <endberg> how can I change a specific image after I preload it? (I almost get it, but not shure) : http://jsfiddle.net/JEYr2/3/
[06:47:47] <gattaus84> ciao
[06:47:59] <gattaus84> !list
[06:51:58] <hooloovoo> endberg: this should do it http://jsfiddle.net/JEYr2/4/
[06:52:05] <hooloovoo> won't work there tho since it can't load the image
[06:52:06] <robert_> so I have a handler for .keypress() and I'm looking to only respond to numbers (0-9), as my handler deals with performing http requests; I don't want to flood my server say, when you're alt-tab'ing to another application... what's the best way to ensure my handler doesn't fire when a non-numeric key is pressed?
[06:52:11] <hooloovoo> endberg: well
[06:53:41] <hooloovoo> endberg: http://jsfiddle.net/JEYr2/5/
[06:53:46] <hooloovoo> something like that
[06:54:17] <Jester86> hey guys.. I'm having an issue of 'change' not triggering
[06:54:43] <Jester86> I'm changing the value of a checkbox in a script and I have another script monitoring said checkbox
[06:54:58] <Jester86> for some reason its not being monitored.
[06:55:18] <Jester86> if I manually change the checkbox it triggers.. just not when the script changes it.
[06:57:09] <endberg> to: hooloovoo that looks good, thanks! Can I use it without the self? like: $("ul#list1 li:eq(1) img").attr('src',  this.attr("src"));
[06:57:40] <pifantastic> pwd
[06:57:43] <hooloovoo> endberg: nope, that's give you the context of $("ul€#list1 li:eq(1) img")
[06:57:49] <pifantastic> oops
[06:57:53] <endberg> ah, right
[06:59:35] <enbergj> endberg: you know, this is quite confusing that we are both on the same channel
[06:59:42] <enbergj> ;)
[07:00:07] <enbergj> I didn't even realize it was an autocomplete fail earlier when someone replied with your nick, thought they just repeatedly typoed mine
[07:00:36] * endberg shrugs...
[07:00:36] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[07:01:15] <juha_> dudes
[07:01:53] <juha_> enbergj: hey o/
[07:02:47] <Zuhai> how can i target an element inside an iframe, the iframe is in the same domain
[07:05:21] <pifantastic> Zuhai: http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[07:06:01] <Zuhai> i read that allready, but so far i coulndt get it to work:S
[07:08:10] <jonclark> i'm trying to wrap my head around this imagesLoaded plugin that desandro made (https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded), is anyone able to show how it could work on an image loaded into memory with a dynamic src instead of images baked right into the markup?
[07:10:54] <enbergj> hi juha_
[07:11:08] <jonclark> nvm.. i will keep trying. just got desperate :(
[07:13:34] <abletony84> ravenzz: hmmm.. maybe.. my designer wanted buttons for all actions though, i'll see if she can't be persuaded otherwise
[07:13:51] <NodeX> jonclark : what's the problem?
[07:14:47] <jonclark> NodeX, it seems like all the examples work on a container loading in a bunch of images, or a set of images -- i'm trying to work out how i would use it when i'm loading an image into memory
[07:14:57] <Kingsy> how come in this example --> http://jsfiddle.net/xfD8c/ <-- it never alerts "HELLO" ? if the classname is changed to match that of the second click() and therefore nolonger matches the first.. how they hell can it keep saying "Goodbye" ?
[07:15:11] <pifantastic> ?paste @ Zuhai
[07:15:11] <jonclark> i need to set it as a background-image, not drop it into the dom anywhere
[07:15:11] <bot-t> Zuhai, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:15:13] <abletony84> shes like.. one of them who thinks that useit.com is the best site in the world
[07:15:14] <NodeX> clientside memory?
[07:15:28] <pseudonymous> How would you guys debug an ajax request ? I have an ajax request where I never see anything come of it. I've tried throwing alert calls into the beforeSend/success/error/complete functions but nope.. no dice
[07:15:41] <abletony84> but in the end i always end up liking her work so.. shes good..
[07:15:46] <NodeX> css background-images don't have a loaded attribute
[07:16:02] <NodeX> or a readystate *
[07:16:08] <pifantastic> ?on @ NodeX
[07:16:09] <bot-t> NodeX, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:16:16] <NodeX> ?
[07:16:34] <NodeX> pifantastic?
[07:16:37] <jonclark> ok, so i suppose i should load the image i want into an invisible part of the dom
[07:16:46] <NodeX> that's a better solution
[07:16:53] <jonclark> then work with it to change the css i need
[07:17:02] <NodeX> if it's cached it will load faster obviously
[07:17:11] <jonclark> yep
[07:17:23] <NodeX> which element is it loading for
[07:17:37] <jonclark> err.. ? i don't understand
[07:17:53] <jonclark> it's like a gallery of thumbnails with a spot for an enlarged image
[07:18:14] <NodeX> so it's a div or somehting?
[07:18:21] <jonclark> so when i click on a thumb i want the image to load, then grab its height/width to modify the fullsize area.. it's overly complicated :\
[07:18:22] <pifantastic> Sorry NodeX , that was for Kingsy
[07:18:34] <jonclark> i'm gonna try this out.. thanks NodeX
[07:19:38] <granden> How would I do something like, for each .varor I want to find construct a <input > line, and each varor contains a .typ and a .summa1 , the line should look something like <input type='hidden' name='(ontentof .typ)[]' value='(contentof .summa)'>
[07:19:45] <NodeX> you can try binding a ready event to the div you're loading it to, I am not sure how cross browser it would be
[07:19:55] <pifantastic> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/YVuXb/3/
[07:20:14] <granden> oh sorry, just figuerd it out.
[07:20:31] <Kingsy> pifantastic: ok, so your using on() there why cant you use click() ?
[07:20:34] <pifantastic> Kingsy: the problem is that you're binding the click handler *directly* to the element, so even if the element's class changes, the event handler is already bound
[07:20:47] <Kingsy> oh right
[07:20:49] <jonclark> hehe that's how it works granden, all you gotta do is ask the question to a room full of people and your brain starts working :)
[07:21:01] <pifantastic> Kingsy: secondly, the other click handler never binds because when it runs no element that matches that selector exists yet
[07:21:17] <Kingsy> pifantastic: so with using on() you can assign 2 handlers per element based on requirements?
[07:22:05] <pifantastic> Kingsy: .on() is a lot more than that, you should definitely read the docs carefully
[07:22:42] <granden> how do I destroy an array in javascript? I need it to be null so I can start from the begining
[07:23:07] <Kingsy> pifantastic: ok thanks
[07:25:39] <pseudonymous> https://gist.github.com/3341207 -- can someone spot an obvious noobie mistake here ? Using firebug I can see that code execution gets inside my $.ajax request - but I don't ever see any of the alerts inside the functions
[07:28:29] <hooloovoo> pseudonymous: umm
[07:29:18] <hooloovoo> pseudonymous: oh it's coffee script =P
[07:29:33] <quicksilver> the JS translation is pasted underneath tho
[07:29:35] <pseudonymous> hooloovoo: yea :) I put a compiled version of the JS down below :)
[07:30:25] <hooloovoo> pseudonymous: well you wouldn't see any of those alerts. remove the return on them and it'll prolly work.
[07:30:43] <quicksilver> why would putting a return on them stop them working?
[07:30:51] <pseudonymous> hooloovoo: you can't see alerts that are called from within a function ?
[07:31:17] <hooloovoo> quicksilver: i just don't have a clue to where they end up when returned.
[07:31:29] <quicksilver> it doesn't matter where they 'end up'
[07:31:36] <quicksilver> just evaluating them will display the alert.
[07:31:43] <quicksilver> (function() { return alert("hi"); })();
[07:31:48] <quicksilver> try it in your favourite console
[07:32:47] <quicksilver> pseudonymous: do you see the 'lol' alert?
[07:33:07] <quicksilver> pseudonymous: type: GET should be type: "GET"
[07:33:52] <Sicp> this sounds completely stupid but this: http://api.jquery.com/each/ was not able to teach me about to do an .each() for 4 times..
[07:33:59] <Sicp> .each(index = 4) doesn't work
[07:34:04] <pseudonymous> quicksilver: whoops, you're totally right :) Will try to see if that does it
[07:34:25] <Sicp> ah, what I do is rely on the element I'm doing the each on so I could get a count
[07:34:42] <Sicp> so I do $("page").each(index), and index becomes 4 if I have four pages
[07:34:58] <pseudonymous> quicksilver: yup indeed ;) I have MASSIVE problems though with some other stuff, but at least I'm not stuck any more
[07:35:01] <jonclark> index is the current position in the loop, Sicp
[07:35:04] <jonclark> so it would be 0, 1, 2, 3
[07:35:07] <pseudonymous> thanks to the both of you!
[07:35:20] <jonclark> $(
[07:35:25] <jonclark> $("page").length would be 4 though
[07:35:25] <Sicp> yea, but the iteration count depends on the count of the elements I'm looping over when I do $(element).each, right jonclark ?
[07:35:28] <Sicp> yea
[07:35:35] <hooloovoo> my brain is damaged from all the returns the coffeescript is creating
[07:35:48] <hooloovoo> i'm curious to why it does that
[07:35:49] <jonclark> you're right Sicp
[07:35:52] <Sicp> but how do I specific explicitly that I want THIS to run 5 times
[07:36:02] <Sicp> regardless of where I'm looping or whatever
[07:36:04] <quicksilver> pseudonymous: you should have seen some kind of error from that though I would have thought.
[07:36:04] <jonclark> i would just use a regular for loop
[07:36:07] <quicksilver> odd.
[07:36:12] <Sicp> for? there's one there?
[07:36:15] <Sicp> ok I will check
[07:36:26] <jonclark> it's not a jquery utility, just use normal js
[07:36:33] <some_dude> how do I catch events from google maps bubble window? I created a button in the bubble hat should trigger switching to another page but jquery deosn't catch it $(#mybutton).click();
[07:39:27] <klawd_prime> hi
[07:39:28] <klawd_prime> http://jsfiddle.net/utqF6/
[07:39:37] <klawd_prime> why do the buttons on the dialog have no text?
[07:41:59] <some_dude> klawd_prime, http://jsfiddle.net/utqF6/
[07:42:02] <klawd_prime> http://jsfiddle.net/gM9fq/
[07:42:16] <klawd_prime> Yes.
[07:42:22] <klawd_prime> no captions on the buttons
[07:42:25] <klawd_prime> do you have captions?
[07:42:54] <some_dude> klawd_prime, http://jsfiddle.net/zlikowsky/utqF6/1/
[07:43:00] <pseudonymous> If an ajax request seems to make the browser very unresponsive I'm guessing it's because I did something wrong. As a test I basically took an entire other page and fetched it's contents and dumped them inside a div on my present page. It seems to "lag" a lot as the page gets readjusted. You can't do such things or what ?
[07:43:34] <jonclark> so it works with 1.7.2 but not with 1.8.0?
[07:43:35] <faraway_> klawd_prime: i would guess that it is a bug … cause with 1.7.2 it works
[07:43:52] <jonclark> looks like in 1.8.0 it's adding a "text" attribute to the button itself.. that's messed
[07:43:57] <klawd_prime> true
[07:44:09] <klawd_prime> anyone in the mood to report it?
[07:44:24] <jonclark> you have the honour klawd_prime
[07:44:38] <klawd_prime> i don't know if i still have an account
[07:45:01] <quicksilver> klawd_prime: already reported

[07:45:21] <some_dude> pseudonymous, sure you can. question is do you want to?
[07:46:03] <pseudonymous> some_dude: haven't quite figured out that part yet. Presently I'm just puzzled as to why my browser becomes so unresponsive afterwards
[07:46:03] <quicksilver> also tickets 8487 8488 and 8489
[07:46:11] <jonclark> quicksilver, learnings :)
[07:46:11] <quicksilver> I guess a few people noticed this problem :P
[07:46:18] <klawd_prime> lol yes, seems like
[07:46:22] <klawd_prime> where's the hotfix then? :P
[07:46:37] <jonclark> it's in the discussions i think
[07:46:43] <quicksilver> there is a one line fix in #8484
[07:46:49] <klawd_prime> yes, saw that
[07:47:00] <some_dude> pseudonymous, depends on what you're loading. you shouldn't really load full pages into your DOM elements, use an iframe for that.
[07:47:03] <Sicp> $(ul).append("<li><a href='#" + $(page#id:i) + "'>" + header + "</a></li>");  <--- doesn't that mean that I will be appending an <li> whose ref is "#mypage3/2/1" to that <ul>?
[07:47:26] <Sicp> I want to get every Page that has an ID containing i (1 2 3 etc..)
[07:48:32] <some_dude> Sicp, http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[07:48:41] <Sicp> I need quotes
[07:48:49] <some_dude> ""
[07:48:57] <some_dude> Sicp, ""
[07:49:17] <Sicp> oh shh, yea i needed contains not :
[07:49:18] <klawd_prime> 3so.. now what? move back to 1.7.2 for the time being?
[07:49:56] <some_dude> klawd_prime, never use new stuff. ever.
[07:50:12] <klawd_prime> it's the current release.
[07:50:18] <klawd_prime> i would've thought it should be stable.
[07:51:05] <klawd_prime> anyone got a link to an uncompressed 1.7.2?
[07:51:30] <Sicp> hmmmmmm it isn't coming out
[07:51:41] <Sicp> $("page#id:contains(i)") <-- does NOT look right, lol
[07:55:01] <ravenzz> abletony84 you can style them as buttons later ;)
[07:56:57] <hlveee> Just realized that this plugin breaks when upgrading to jquery 1.8... any idea what could fix it?
[07:56:58] <hlveee> http://www.hardcode.nl/archives_139/article_244-jquery-sticky-footer.htm
[07:57:26] <hlveee> It's no longer working. no breakpoints or anything. Just using depricated scrollTop I think
[08:06:22] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i appended a table to a div. Then i try to loop through the table to give every TR an onclick event. Now when i click on the table rows always the same row is being 'clicked'. SO i have rows like AAAA , BBBB, CCCC, but always AAAA is being shown as clicked... Can someone take a look at my code pls? http://pastebin.com/r1GUwisB
[08:07:28] <quicksilver> Krambiorix: 'element' as captured in the closure will be shared between all the callbacks
[08:07:39] <quicksilver> by the time the callbacks get called, it will always be the last one
[08:08:28] <Krambiorix> quicksilver, can i solve this?
[08:08:44] <quicksilver> the simplest in this case is probably to use 'this' instead of 'element'
[08:08:46] <quicksilver> callbacks always have 'this'
[08:09:01] <quicksilver> if you want to learn how to program in javascript, though, you need to face this problem at some point
[08:09:05] <quicksilver> there are loads of online docs about it
[08:09:31] <hlveee> quicksilver, now that scrollTop was depricated in 1.8... how do I fix this plugin?
[08:09:39] <quicksilver> hlveee: I don't know.
[08:10:30] <Krambiorix> quicksilver, use this in the call or in the called function?
[08:11:25] <quicksilver> this inside the click callback will be the element clicked on
[08:11:32] <quicksilver> which in your example appears to be what you want.
[08:11:41] <quicksilver> see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/750486/javascript-closure-inside-loops-simple-practical-example for a general description of this issue
[08:11:48] <quicksilver> although I'm sure I saw a clearer explanation once

[08:13:05] <ezio> the main thing is to understand what is a closure
[08:13:35] <ezio> then you can predict when you'll have trouble
[08:14:15] <Krambiorix> quicksilver, this doesn't solve it....

[08:14:52] <endberg> I have a problem with image preloading. If I make a for cycle to load images, and then I try to replace the old images with the new ones, the for cycle runs out before the load finishes. How can I do it correctly?  http://jsfiddle.net/rBYqU/1/

[08:25:10] <endberg> If I change an img src with the .attr("src", "newimagesrc") method, the old image is deleted from the dom/memory?
[08:25:32] <quicksilver> it's deleted from the DOM
[08:25:39] <quicksilver> whether the browser keeps it in memory is up to the browser...
[08:25:49] <endberg> thx
[08:25:49] <ezio> endberg, load the picture into a hidden div and then replace it
[08:25:53] <ezio> i don't know if that will work
[08:26:07] <iEatChildren> previously (as in a while ago) i would use .live when i load elements in to the dom via ajax. being .live is depreciated do i use .on in this instance now?
[08:26:25] <iEatChildren> for example, if a field is blurred to execute a function
[08:26:26] <ezio> endberg, i have an issue that i still haven't dealt with that is almost the same thing
[08:26:33] <ezio> where the spinner keeps loading every time
[08:26:40] <ezio> instead of being cached
[08:26:58] <ezio> iEatChildren, live is deprecated .. someone told me that but i didn't confirm
[08:27:06] <ezio> oops
[08:27:07] <ezio> derp
[08:27:15] <ezio> yes use .on
[08:27:55] <ezio> sit and drink pennyroyal teaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[08:28:02] <iEatChildren> is .on to be used whenever i load fields via ajax that i wish to execute js functions against?
[08:28:33] <ezio> iEatChildren, can you translate that to english?
[08:28:51] <rmurphey> iEatChildren: yes
[08:29:03] <iEatChildren> ezio, rmurphey - thank you both
[08:29:17] <rmurphey> iEatChildren: .on is now the one method that you use for binding events normally and for event delegation
[08:29:17] <quicksilver> you have to use it correctly, though
[08:29:23] <quicksilver> just replacing 'live' with 'on' will not work
[08:29:26] <rmurphey> in the case of event delegation, you need to pass three agruments
[08:29:30] <quicksilver> reading the docs and doing what it says in there will work.
[08:29:34] <rmurphey> and also, yes, it is not a drop-in replacement
[08:29:38] <rmurphey> ?on @ iEatChildren
[08:29:39] <bot-t> iEatChildren, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[08:33:56] <Arieh_> I got a form I let jquery do all sorts of changes to when drop down change etc, and then you can submit the form normally with a full post request. But when you then go Back with your browser you will see the form half filled in, is there a way to detect if someone came 'back' to the page?
[08:35:34] <Krambiorix> quicksilver, what about the thing 'let' ?
[08:35:49] <Krambiorix> in stead of var,  would that solve it?
[08:36:16] <ezio> 10 print "james is awesome"
[08:36:20] <ezio> 20 goto 10
[08:36:21] <ezio> run
[08:36:36] <quicksilver> Krambiorix: it would if you were using javascript 1.7
[08:36:41] <quicksilver> or 1.8 or whatever it is.
[08:36:44] <quicksilver> but you aren't.
[08:42:17] <Sicp> $("body").append(page);
[08:42:17] <Sicp> keeps overwriting whatever the content is and I only end up with the last page
[08:45:05] <endberg> bye
[08:45:52] <shoky> Sicp: is page the actual page that's already in the DOM, or a clone, or a new element, or what
[08:46:03] <Sicp> new element that I created
[08:46:24] <Sicp> http://pastebin.com/GFcX8NKr here's the code
[08:46:29] <Sicp> I'm trying to build a navigation..
[08:46:43] <Krambiorix> quicksilver, from what i read on the pages you send me, i made the following, but it doesn't work too: http://pastebin.com/yS490Dfy
[08:46:43] <Sicp> I get the last page constructed as the first (and only) page being displayed
[08:46:55] <Sicp> but the inspector shows that they've all been added successfully
[08:46:58] <shoky> Sicp: doing $(page).attr(...)  doesn't do anything
[08:47:08] <shoky> oops
[08:47:09] <Sicp> but it does add the attrs and I can see them here
[08:47:12] <shoky> my bad sorry
[08:47:52] <quicksilver> Krambiorix: that doesn't change anything.
[08:48:27] <quicksilver> Krambiorix: 'element' is still bound in the loop body and shared by every iteration of the loop.
[08:49:11] <Krambiorix> quicksilver, so i should call the returnElement function in the onclick event?
[08:53:16] <vincenzoml> Hi there, I am learning html5 and javascript for the first time and I am specifically interested in manipulating files from the client side.
[08:54:09] <vincenzoml> I would like to split a file in chunks and then ... reassemble them to play them using the <video> tag
[08:54:30] <shoky> Sicp: donno your code looks fine (except for you re-creating the jquery objects on each line.. just do var page = $('<div/>');  page.attr(..).addClass(...); etc. )
[08:55:00] <vincenzoml> is it possible at all to use e.g. a javascript object as the value for the src property of a video?
[08:55:26] <shoky> Sicp: and the fact that you're using some global variables instead of local ones (e.g. page, navBar, ul)
[08:56:01] <Sicp> saying "navbar = etc.." means that I am using a global var?
[08:56:10] <shoky> if you didn't declare it locally, yes
[08:56:17] <Sicp> ok
[08:56:36] <shoky> but i doubt that's the cause of your said problem
[08:57:51] <shoky> oh you said the inspector shows that they've all been added successfully
[08:57:53] <shoky> didn't see that
[08:58:00] <shoky> so , all is fine
[08:58:13] <shoky> figure out why it's not displaying.. (with the inspector)
[09:01:49] <Krambiorix> quicksilver, i solved it thanks!
[09:02:58] <quicksilver> Krambiorix: :)
[09:03:55] <opalepatrick> I want to, on select option change, replace the text in a span - this http://pastebin.com/X3KVZQkW isnt working... I cobbled it together, so any expertise appreciated :-)
[09:05:57] <drummer306> so i guess, heres a question, for query mobile, should <a href="someotherpage.html">click</a>  load via ajax and create a hash history ? or does only <a href="#foo">foo</a> work ?
[09:07:36] <shoky> opalepatrick: try $(this).val()
[09:11:21] <opalepatrick> must be something else shoky... should that code work? Not getting any errors in firebug... weird
[09:12:47] <shoky> opalepatrick: i'd need to see the html to know if it should work
[09:13:09] <shoky> opalepatrick: also did you put it inside a $(document).ready handler
[09:13:13] <drummer306> so I guess i see some new issues, the links arent generating hash history in the url, or jquery or something is overriting that after page load, because going directly to myapp/#somepage/ loads properly
[09:14:04] <drummer306> and when i hit mayapp/#somepage/ directly, it changes the url to myapp/somepage/ instead of keeping the hash
[09:14:18] <opalepatrick> Sorting that shoky, but yes in $(document).ready handler
[09:17:33] <opalepatrick> http://pastebin.com/qsjSAdFP - thanks for the help shoky
[09:18:26] <opalepatrick> ignore that missing a line
[09:19:14] <opalepatrick> sorry shoky - http://pastebin.com/3fyg667i
[09:19:45] <shoky> opalepatrick: $('#ac_change span')
[09:19:56] <shoky> you know what that selector looks for?

[09:20:18] <gym_jane> hi all
[09:20:57] <gym_jane> If I have <h1> Here is my title</h1>, is there a way to change the colour of "title" in that h1 without adding spans around it?
[09:21:24] <Zuhai> how can i detect when a iframe is loaded?
[09:22:05] <shoky> opalepatrick:  $('span#ac_change')
[09:22:19] <opalepatrick> got it shoky... I was just a bit slow on the uptake
[09:22:57] <opalepatrick> actually is there any harm in just doing $('#ac_change') ?
[09:23:23] <opalepatrick> (it did work) - thanks a lot shoky
[09:23:48] <shoky> no harm ;P
[09:25:42] <opalepatrick> shoky, I take it that was looking for a span in the #ac_change span?
[09:26:01] <opalepatrick> *another span#
[09:26:26] <shoky> opalepatrick: yep
[09:26:33] <opalepatrick> cheers
[09:32:44] <DeltaHeavy|Work> http://w3techs.com/blog/entry/jquery_now_runs_on_every_second_website
[09:39:48] <vincenzoml> I am looking for a way to let the user download a file from javascript (no server-side data or code). I already did that using the FileSaver emulation by eligrey, but now I would like to "fill" the data from javascript dynamically, while the data is downloaded
[09:40:24] <hobs_> ayum DeltaHeavy|Work
[09:40:27] <hobs_> dayum*
[09:40:30] <vincenzoml> The idea is that I can generate chunks of a large file from javascript and "serve" them as a download. Do you think this is possible at all in javascript?
[09:43:13] <gym_jane> how can I make this work?
[09:43:27] <gym_jane> <h1>Brilliant Bunny</h1>
[09:43:29] <gym_jane> $("h1:contains('Brilliant')").css("color", "red");
[09:43:30] <gym_jane> $("h1:contains('Bunny')").css("color", "blue");
[09:44:00] <quicksilver> gym_jane: as far as I know, you will have to add spans.
[09:44:23] <quicksilver> or some other element (<a> or <b> or <em> etc would work) to delimit the bits you want to change the colour of
[09:44:43] <gym_jane> hmm
[09:44:44] <gym_jane> ok
[09:44:49] <gym_jane> no alternatives then... :/
[09:45:03] <faraway_> vincenzoml: don't know which browser support this   http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/zPfSP/
[09:45:12] <faraway_> vincenzoml: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-URL
[09:45:19] <shoky> gym_jane: styling is done to elements, not .. words

[09:45:39] <faraway_> vincenzoml: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme
[09:45:46] <faraway_> vincenzoml: sory the last one ;)
[09:46:09] <gym_jane> shoky i know but i am trying to do the impossible :)
[09:46:16] <gym_jane> its called optimism :)
[09:49:32] <MistuhKurtz> gym_jane, iirc ben alman has a 'contains' plugin
[09:49:46] <faraway_> vincenzoml: but there is a size limit, i would say about a maximum of 32kb
[09:50:50] <gym_jane> looking at his site now
[09:50:52] <gym_jane> thanks
[09:51:12] <vincenzoml> faraway_: as far as I understand, using the data URI scheme I will need to reassemble the full file in memory
[09:51:27] <vincenzoml> faraway_: and as you say I'll have a size limit
[09:52:03] <faraway_> vincenzoml: thats the only way i could think about gnerating a file in js that is donloadable without sending the data to the server first
[09:52:17] <faraway_> downloadable
[09:53:19] <vincenzoml> faraway_: I am thinking of an "infinite" iframe, but I don't understand whether I will be able to serve a binary file (octet stream) with that metod
[09:53:36] <vincenzoml> faraway_: I am a bit ignorant about javascript
[09:54:17] <faraway_> vincenzoml: sorry i think i don't get what you try to do :D
[09:58:31] <Cluber> I have a form and I want I am sending data to a PHP script using jQuery ajax POST, which gives me a JSON response. This is fine, however what if the user has Javascript disabled(some mobile users) is there a safe way to make sure the form is submitted in an alternative way?
[10:01:12] <codepython777> If I assign $("non_existent_class").click -- and then create this element and click on it, is it supposed to work? Whats the correct way of doing this?
[10:02:20] <mintux> I have this code (I got it from a movie tutorial) but it doesn't work . I don't get any alert http://codepad.org/79x716dB  why ?
[10:02:40] <MistuhKurtz> Cluber, just set the action to point to the same URL you want it to post to
[10:02:50] <MistuhKurtz> er
[10:03:05] <MistuhKurtz> a different URL i suppose,  since you need it to return something other than JSON
[10:04:59] <mintux> what's my wrong ?
[10:08:00] <mintux> and it's the screenshot of tutorial http://www.img4up.com/up2/74397938593747313912.jpeg  but for mine doesn't work  http://codepad.org/79x716dB
[10:08:25] <Cluber> MistuhKurtz: but the URL i am targetting just outputs some JSON data, and does nothing in terms of formatting etc.
[10:09:00] <Cluber> You see my ajax request just grabs the json, and my form-page handles the presentation
[10:09:10] <shoky> mintux: you need to wrap your code with a $(document).ready(function() { ... })
[10:09:24] <Cluber> if i was to put to the JSON target page, it will just display the json on the page
[10:09:33] <Cluber> *put=post
[10:09:40] <MistuhKurtz> I corrected myself and said a different URL since you don't want to see JSON
[10:09:43] <MistuhKurtz> :)
[10:09:49] <Cluber> ah sorry
[10:10:04] <Cluber> ah right so i would have an alternative to handle the non-javascript users
[10:11:50] <mintux> shoky: didn't work http://codepad.org/jLs9OHmS
[10:13:08] <shoky> mintux: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/4MxU6/
[10:14:12] <shoky> mintux: but the load event for images is known to be iffy
[10:14:26] <quiznilo> I'm trying to use this greybox script http://orangoo.com/labs/GreyBox/ with jquery, but it gives me fits
[10:14:29] <shoky> mintux: at least for images loaded on page load
[10:15:04] <shoky> mintux: you can use $(window).load(function() { alert('hi') })   but that'll wait till all images are loaded
[10:15:12] <quiznilo> I saw that there is some way to make jquery act in some kind of no-compat mode, where you have to type out jQuery every time, I hope that fixes it

[10:16:13] <mintux> yeah I know . just for tutorial . im follow   that tutrial
[10:16:17] <quiznilo> excellent!  thank you
[10:16:49] <mintux> worked
[10:17:17] <Zuhai> how do i make find work with new elements added to the dom?
[10:18:26] <codepython777> I add a li to a ul using $(".ulclass li").append("..li element") -- works, but when i print its size() i keep getting the same number?
[10:18:54] <shoky> Zuhai: if you call it after they are added then it should find them
[10:18:56] <codepython777> sorry, I use $(".ulclass")
[10:19:37] <shoky> codepython777: size() (or length) just tells you how many elements there are in the jq collection
[10:19:39] <codepython777> shoky: i get the same number as the beignning of page load...and i see my ul list growing...
[10:19:55] <Zuhai> new elements are added repeatedly, how do I use find() each time new elements are added
[10:19:58] <shoky> codepython777: appending to an element doesnt increase the length of the jq object wrapping that element
[10:20:13] <shoky> codepython777: you still only have that _one_ <ul>
[10:20:13] <Zuhai> i tried to use it with live() but that dindt work
[10:20:20] <codepython777>  shoky: so how do i get the correct size?
[10:20:29] <shoky> codepython777: correct size of what?
[10:20:37] <codepython777> I want the number of li's in that ul
[10:20:45] <shoky> codepython777: then .children().length
[10:20:48] <codepython777> including the ones jquery appended
[10:21:17] <codepython777> trying
[10:21:27] <some_dude> hey, I got a button in my google maps info vindow . anyone knows how to handle the event when someone clicks that button?
[10:21:29] <cjeria> hey ember peeps, how can I implement jquery widgets with my ember app? Any good resource suggestions?
[10:26:24] <codepython777> shoky: same result. The number does not change for .children().length either -- http://pbin.be/show/766/
[10:27:43] <shoky> codepython777: either $(".emailslist").children().length , or $(".emailslist li").length ...
[10:28:14] <ezio> does anyone know why the spinner.gif would be loading from the server every time?
[10:28:22] <ezio> every time i make an ajax request
[10:28:23] <shoky> codepython777: also sometimes you use emaillist and other times you put emailslist
[10:33:27] <jacta> Can anyone help me getting pause to work on hover? http://pastebin.com/94HM9Ncp
[10:33:33] <codepython777> shoky: http://pbin.be/show/769/ -- still shows me a constant
[10:34:29] <codepython777> shoky: length = 0-- even at the beginning.
[10:34:47] <shoky> jacta: wtf... first of all you didn't declare that 'pause' variable anywhere. 2nd, having a function named 'pause' and also a variable named 'pause' will screw you up.
[10:35:47] <shoky> codepython777: also sometimes you use emaillist and other times you put emailslist
[10:36:24] <jacta> shoky, no alert :\ - ill try correct a bit and make new paste
[10:36:34] <codepython777> shoky: lemme fix that first
[10:37:23] <shoky> jacta: don't make a new paste, make a new jsfiddle demonstrating your issue
[10:37:47] <jacta> is it possible to load that?
[10:38:18] <codepython777> shoky: That was indeed the problem! I need to be hit for that one.
[10:38:29] * shoky kicks codepython777
[10:38:31] <codepython777> an hour wasted for an "s"!
[10:40:17] <shoky> codepython777: next time pastebin _before_ you ask what you _think_ you should be asking ;P
[10:45:19] <hlveee> Is there a bug with scrollTop with 1.8?
[10:45:37] <jacta> shoky, how can I load jcaroussel - dont get it :(
[10:45:49] <hlveee> Sup shoky :)
[10:46:09] <shoky> yo hlve
[10:46:44] <faraway_> hlveee: what problem do oyu have in 1.8 with scroll top ?
[10:46:54] <shoky> jacta: huh jcarousel?  well you just add it as an external resource (if you meant how to load it in jsfiddle..)
[10:47:18] <jacta> shoky, tried to, seems like the code wont run :\
[10:47:46] <shoky> jacta: oh well.
[10:47:51] <jacta> Guess I can try share it now - could be me
[10:47:59] <jacta> http://jsfiddle.net/nYHhu/ is the link
[10:48:08] <hlveee> do you know if there are any bugs with issues using ScrollTop in 1.8? I have no idea where to look, but when I tried using this plugin, it wasn't working (no breakpoints. either.) http://www.hardcode.nl/archives_139/article_244-jquery-sticky-footer.htm
[10:48:46] <shoky> jacta: GET http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/lib/jquery.jcarousel.min.js 403 (Forbidden)
[10:49:03] <jacta> oh - okay - :p
[10:50:09] <quiznilo> hmm... "You should avoid using properties or methods of a form in the name attribute" http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10891
[10:50:38] <quiznilo> <input type=text name=Foo name=Foo> like that?
[10:50:53] <hlveee> why would you have two names quicksilver? :P
[10:50:54] <hlveee> er
[10:50:56] <hlveee> quiznilo*
[10:50:56] <hlveee> lol
[10:51:12] <quiznilo> name=Foo id=Foo I meant
[10:51:15] <hlveee> oh
[10:51:29] <hlveee> it's good practice to not do that ;p
[10:51:32] <quiznilo> name for html handling, id for dom handling
[10:51:35] <shoky> jacta: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nYHhu/1/
[10:51:38] <quiznilo> is that wrong?
[10:51:46] <faraway_> hlveee: well the script is not the best ;)
[10:51:57] <faraway_> hlveee: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/CZyyR/1/
[10:52:01] <hlveee> faraway_, it was the only one that worked for me ;p
[10:52:23] <hlveee> Hm!
[10:52:24] <jita> If i open a sub window using window.open, can i access the parent window that opened it ?
[10:52:30] <faraway_> hlveee: it could be that document and window height is handled different
[10:52:41] <jacta> shoky, let me check it out
[10:52:53] <hlveee> I'll try that code out. One sec. :)
[10:52:58] <shoky> jacta: i just made it load jcarousel properly, didn't change anything in your code
[10:53:25] <shoky> jita: there's window.opener ..
[10:53:31] <faraway_> hlveee: it is the same as on the page just the if condition commented out
[10:54:24] <jacta> shoky, you added some code right?
[10:54:43] <shoky> jacta: none , i just clicked 'TidyUp' button :P
[10:54:49] <codepython777> shoky: I dynamically add elements to a ul with a class for which i have .click() defined. When I click, nothing happens. Am I missing something?
[10:55:10] <shoky> jacta: and removed unncesssary stuff from your html (jsfiddle already adds <html><body> for you)
[10:55:29] <shoky> codepython777: also sometimes you use emaillist and other times you put emailslist
[10:55:47] <codepython777> I thought i fixed that. Lemme check again
[10:55:53] <shoky> hehh i'm kidding
[10:57:33] <codepython777> shoky: http://pbin.be/show/770/ :) I did fix that.
[10:57:59] <codepython777> shoky: the "Request Emails" button stops working after the refresh
[10:59:24] <codepython777> shoky: I'm trapping the click using: $("a.bs-prompt").click(function(e) {...
[10:59:57] <jacta> shoky, but you added jcaroussel?
[11:00:04] <shoky> codepython777: thought you said you had .click defined on the ul  :\
[11:00:35] <codepython777> does that make a difference? if so, why?
[11:00:49] <shoky> codepython777:  $('a.bs-prompt').click(...) only adds a handler to elements currently found in the DOM
[11:01:10] <codepython777> hmm...how can one fix this?
[11:01:49] <shoky> codepython777: you probably want to use event delegation, use .on or .delegate: e.g. $('.emailslist').on('click', 'a.bs-prompt', function() { .... });
[11:02:29] <shoky> codepython777: and read about event delegation here http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:03:44] <codepython777> reading...thanks
[11:04:45] <hlveee> faraway_ / Shoky... any idea's on this? http://jsfiddle.net/CQcrU/ Doesn't work using jQ 1.8, but does using 1.7.2  .. http://jsfiddle.net/CQcrU/1/
[11:05:01] <hlveee> faraway_, I tried that last bit of code you gave me, didn't work :\
[11:05:19] <eni_> $('div#slide-text p:visible').fadeOut(500, function() { will it get all <p> that are visible?
[11:05:34] <shoky> jacta: yes, click 'Manage Resources' on the left
[11:07:38] <shoky> hlveee: docHeight is NaN in 1.8 :P
[11:07:42] <faraway_> hlveee: you don't have an element with id 'sticky-footer-push' in you html code , jquery 1.8 returns NaN for the height so this does not work
[11:07:50] <hlveee> Ah
[11:08:07] <hlveee> Any workaround?
[11:08:26] <shoky> ^^
[11:08:29] <faraway_> hlveee: removing $("#sticky-footer-push").height() ;)
[11:08:49] <faraway_> hlveee: or adding an element with id #sticky-footer-push :P
[11:09:04] <faraway_> hlveee: thats up to you and depends on what you need
[11:09:10] <eni_> can someone give me an idea of what is that suposed to do?
[11:09:18] <hlveee> Ah!
[11:09:18] <hlveee> :)
[11:09:25] <hlveee> http://jsfiddle.net/CQcrU/2/
[11:09:27] <hlveee> Muahha.
[11:09:29] <hlveee> Thank you guys!
[11:09:29] <hlveee> :)
[11:09:45] <faraway_> hlveee: and probably try to understand the code :D
[11:09:46] <shoky> eni_: that will fade out visible <p>s under div#slide-text
[11:10:01] <codepython777> shoky: thanks for that reference :) Works like a charm
[11:10:08] <eni_> shoky, thanks.
[11:10:12] <eni_> i was in doubt.
[11:10:13] <shoky> ywyw
[11:10:19] <eni_> if it would hide all our just the first one.
[11:10:41] <faraway_> hlveee: ah well removing won't work sorry .. didn't look close enough
[11:12:23] <quiznilo> fixed... oorah... solution is at the bottom of that bug report
[11:12:34] <faraway_> hlveee: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/CQcrU/3/ but still this is a bad script :D
[11:14:02] <jacta> shoky, mmhhhhhm
[11:14:26] <eni_> shoky, if you fadeout a p:visible, than it won't fall for p:visible anymore?
[11:15:02] <shoky> eni_: yup, think so.. after the fadeout is finished, at least ;P
[11:16:04] <platzhirsch> What is the appropriate way to share object definitions across multiple JS files when the object was defined inside the document.read function?
[11:16:20] <jacta> shoky, updated http://jsfiddle.net/nYHhu/2/ - I'm a bit lost how I should get it to work from here though
[11:17:02] <platzhirsch> move the variable declaration outside the read functton?
[11:17:12] <rmurphey> platzhirsch: that's one way
[11:17:19] <rmurphey> better is to define a "namespace" for your app
[11:18:08] <rmurphey> platzhirsch: http://jsbin.com/acipac/1/edit
[11:18:25] <shoky> jacta: how to get what to work?
[11:18:37] <jacta> shoky, pause on hover :\
[11:18:39] <shoky> jacta: also why did you want to load jcarousel if you're not using it?
[11:18:41] <platzhirsch> rmurphey: ah great, I have used that already.. totally forgot about that
[11:18:48] <rmurphey> platzhirsch: that way you only take up one place in the global namespace
[11:18:56] <jacta> shoky, I'm using it?
[11:19:06] <shoky> jacta: where..
[11:19:22] <shoky> jacta: you're doing the slideshow yourself
[11:19:32] <shoky> jacta: ???
[11:19:36] <jacta> omg - hrmm
[11:19:55] <jacta> that seems pretty stupid then :\
[11:20:19] <shoky> well your slideshow works, so dont feel bad :P
[11:22:14] <fosser_josh1> Ziggy`: hi
[11:24:16] <jacta> shoky, true, but the thing I'm trying to do dont :\
[11:24:20] <jacta> kinda stuck
[11:24:37] <fosser_josh1> Ziggy`: http://jsfiddle.net/9nLgf/ this code is not working in my file. firebug shows me error TypeError: ".assetlink".on is not a function -('.assetlink').on('click', function(e) {
[11:31:34] <jacta> shoky, do you get it?
[11:36:01] <skylined101> Hello
[11:37:15] <skylined101> i need a ( click 2 get ) button , upload 100 unique files with same name . and give to each visitor 1 file after he completes form
[11:37:34] <skylined101> anyone have idea please ?
[11:39:14] <Zuhai> im echoing some out some js with php, and looking at what others have done. they use //<![CDATA[ //]]> but what does that do? and is is neccesary?
[11:40:28] <ravenzz> no if your doctype is not xhtml
[11:42:02] <Zuhai> ok
[11:49:09] <zarella>  /win 89
[11:49:20] <muay-guy> Hi, how could I do the following: I want to check whether or not there's a link INSIDE a "li.comment-add" element…. if there is no link, I want to set it to "display:none;"
[11:49:29] <dabear> zarella: I prefer win 98
[11:49:48] <shoky> jacta: sry was afk
[11:49:56] <dabear> muay-guy: what specifically is your problem?
[11:50:15] <dabear> muay-guy: .find and .length
[11:50:18] <dabear> and .css
[11:51:11] <faraway_> muay-guy: http://api.jquery.com/has/
[11:51:24] <muay-guy> dabear: the problem is I want this text to show up if it's linked… if it's not linked I want to hide it
[11:52:05] <shoky> jacta: your main problem is that you are not waiting for the fades to finish before queuing up more fades
[11:52:23] <shoky> jacta: so your animation queues just get bigger and bigger
[11:52:44] <dabear> muay-guy: seriously? you want US to do it for you? then you're in the wrong chan. see ?mdc if else javascript
[11:52:59] <dabear> ?mdc if else javascript
[11:53:14] <dabear> muay-guy: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else
[11:53:33] <shoky> jacta: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nYHhu/6/
[11:54:24] <dabear> muay-guy: at least try your self before posting here
[11:55:16] <muay-guy> dabear: stop crying about it, I just didn't know what the selector was
[11:59:10] <konr_trab> when I run the selector $(".foo:checked"), jQuery returns what appears to be a list of jQuery objects refering to checkboxes, but they do not seem have the val() method, as $(".foo:checked").map(function(x){return x.val()}) reports that "Object 0 has no method val". What am I doing wrong?
[11:59:37] <loincloth> hi all.. has anyone ever messed with something like this: http://www.requirejs.org/jqueryui-amd/example/webapp/app.html wrappin jquery-ui modules in AMD
[11:59:44] <faraway_> konr_trab: $(x).val()
[11:59:54] <loincloth> i was pondering something like this for my app..
[12:01:33] <faraway_> konr_trab: but not sure if map is really the function you want to use, and the first apram of the map callback is an index and not the object
[12:02:18] <faraway_> konr_trab: http://api.jquery.com/map/
[12:03:50] <StanAccy> I have the following structure: <div id="outer"><div><ul><li>   Given that I have the ID of the outer div, how do I write a selector for all <li> within id="outer" ?
[12:04:21] <shoky> StanAccy: $('#outer li')
[12:04:51] <StanAccy> shoky: Thanks - that will 'ignore' all the other markup inbetween the outer div and the <li? ?
[12:05:11] <shoky> StanAccy: as long as it's not another <li>, yes ;p
[12:05:25] <faraway_> StanAccy: http://api.jquery.com/descendant-selector/
[12:06:05] <Emn1ty> any reason why jquery-latest.js and jquery-ui.js would conflict?
[12:06:21] <shoky> yes
[12:06:26] <shoky> they conflict.
[12:06:40] <shoky> oh wait jqui not latest?
[12:07:07] <Emn1ty> The thing is, if I keep jq-ui all the js on the page ceases to function
[12:07:22] <shoky> what version of each..
[12:07:24] <Emn1ty> but if I keep jq-lates.js then the datepicer doesn;t work
[12:07:33] <StanAccy> faraway_: Thanks
[12:07:35] <StanAccy> shoky: Thanks
[12:07:51] <Emn1ty> um, http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js and http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.18/jquery-ui.min.js
[12:08:18] <jacta> shoky, sorry - i was away :\
[12:08:21] <shoky> oh. that should work fine i think
[12:08:41] <Emn1ty> well, when I put them both in my .bx-slider blows up on my homepage
[12:08:43] <shoky> how come jquery-latest.js is 1.7.2 :\
[12:09:09] <Emn1ty> um, not sure want me to replace it with the google one?
[12:09:30] <shoky> Emn1ty: this is latest jquery http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[12:09:53] <shoky> Emn1ty: no idea what bx-slider is
[12:10:07] <Emn1ty> a jquery slider
[12:10:10] <shoky> and "blows up" , "ceases to function" etc are not helpful
[12:10:19] <Emn1ty> It literally flies off my page
[12:10:24] <Emn1ty> disappears
[12:10:37] <Emn1ty> Renders, then does a slide and then flies off the page
[12:10:40] <shoky> turn off your monitor, dont let it leave
[12:10:45] <Emn1ty> haha
[12:10:49] <ezakimak> if i do $(selector).addClass(), does it remember it and do it again to new elements added to the page? or do I have to call it again?
[12:11:03] <shoky> Emn1ty: anyway, no idea ;P
[12:11:08] <Emn1ty> ok
[12:11:18] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks.
[12:11:23] <Emn1ty> shoky: http://www.hornburgpreowned.com/home
[12:11:45] <faraway_> ezakimak: you need to call again
[12:11:47] <shoky> ezakimak: it doesnt "remember" and do anything again
[12:12:13] <Emn1ty> ah, fixed it I think
[12:12:17] <jacta> shoky, studying the code now - works really good - thanks a bunch!
[12:12:20] <ezakimak> is there a way to hijack element creation to provide a handler to apply styles?
[12:12:42] <jonathancutrell> I'm having some trouble with Google maps, wanted to see if anyone in here has had issues with proportions; the canvases seem to be vertically squished, and I have no clue why. I'm using the v3 api to drop in a map dynamically, and then I use the resize event to try to refresh the map; this successfully clears empty blocks, but I'm still having the proportion issue.
[12:12:48] <shoky> ezakimak: yeah, use CSS
[12:13:00] <ezakimak> CSS doesn't do what I want
[12:13:00] <shoky> no better hijacking
[12:13:16] <shoky> CSS applies styles, i thought that's what you want :\
[12:13:27] <ezakimak> i don't want to have to manually specify class="" to every single element
[12:13:32] <shoky> why not?
[12:13:37] <shoky> that's exactly what you should do
[12:13:55] <ezakimak> CSS doesn't do class composition--it's purely textual
[12:14:08] <shoky> wat?
[12:14:08] <b-ot> i've use $.ajaxSetup with contextType: 'application/json' it's work. but it don't solve my problem. the problem was not it.
[12:14:39] <ezakimak> i want all input[type=button] to have ui-state-default ui-corner-all
[12:15:03] <ezakimak> i cannot do that in CSS w/out textually duplicating the definitions of ui-state-default and ui-corner-all, which defeats the purpose of the theme roller
[12:15:23] <ezakimak> or, manually specifying those classes on every input button in the html
[12:15:45] <ezakimak> and then, if i *shudder* change my mind have to go edit every input button in the site
[12:15:51] <jonathancutrell> Ah I fixed it - issue with img elements having a max height/width.
[12:16:06] <ezakimak> thus .addClass() works great, except for new elements
[12:16:20] <jkarsrud> hook the class on when you create it then?
[12:16:29] <shoky> it works great for new elements too
[12:16:38] <jkarsrud> $('<div class="someClass">'); ?
[12:16:43] <shoky> or that
[12:17:10] <ezakimak> huh?
[12:17:11] <shoky> ezakimak: if you are afraid you will want to make a big change  that affects all the buttons you create, then create them all from a central place
[12:17:23] <shoky> then you will have that one place that does .addClass() or whatever
[12:17:49] <ezakimak> how do i create all buttons in one place? they are scattered throught dozens of templates
[12:17:54] <ezakimak> *throughout
[12:18:06] <ezakimak> and my templates are rendered on-demand
[12:18:47] <jkarsrud> well, honestly. If you have some classes on your buttons that are so specific that you'd have to change the classes to reflect some design changes or whatever, you're doing something wrong somewhere
[12:18:57] <jkarsrud> that is my opinion tho
[12:19:03] <jkarsrud> generic classes ftw
[12:19:10] <ezakimak> why is it so wrong to want a feature that CSS should have added a long time ago?
[12:19:19] <jkarsrud> what is that feature?
[12:19:38] <jkarsrud> it applies styles to selected elements
[12:19:42] <ezakimak> .mybutton { @include .ui-state-default .ui-corner-all } ...
[12:20:08] <jkarsrud> sounds like you want Less or Sass tbh
[12:20:22] <ezakimak> yes, but they present other difficulties
[12:20:29] <jkarsrud> like what?
[12:20:40] <ezakimak> namely, they aren't part of the standard
[12:20:45] <jkarsrud> I think you're trying to solve something that has already been solved
[12:20:49] <gnarf> ezakimak: css is already a hierarchal nightmare, and you want them to add include?
[12:20:58] <ezakimak> yes, absolutely
[12:20:59] <jkarsrud> gnarf++
[12:21:07] <gnarf> ezakimak: -1
[12:21:25] <gnarf> ezakimak: stop being selfish - css selectors are beasts
[12:21:37] <ezakimak> i'm not complaining about selectors
[12:22:23] <gnarf> ezakimak: using a pre-processor like less/sass, you could easily have input[type=button] include ui-state-default and ui-corner-all
[12:22:24] <ezakimak> i just want to be able to reference one definition from another--a case of reuse
[12:22:45] <gnarf> however, its just a generally bad idea anyway
[12:22:47] <ezakimak> i don't want to introduce a build process
[12:23:14] <gnarf> a) input[type=button] will override .ui-state-active
[12:23:16] <gnarf> etc
[12:23:34] <gnarf> so if you make it on input[type=button], it will never get clicked/hover/etc
[12:23:56] <gnarf> in fact, you should probably just $("input[type=button]").button(); if you want it to get those styles by default
[12:24:31] <ezakimak> hover()'s not working for me btw.
[12:24:38] <gnarf> and whenever you add new content, you should have a "new content" function to run to be able to hook the simple addClass
[12:24:49] <gnarf> ezakimak: "not working" doesn't mean anything to me
[12:24:58] <gnarf> ?newContent
[12:25:13] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/1003630
[12:25:17] <gnarf> ezakimak: ^^^
[12:26:26] <ezakimak> nm. hover works. forgot i had to call it after the element existed...
[12:26:31] <jacta> shoky, fun, I can't get it to work on my site though :\
[12:27:36] <ezakimak> hrm. not exactly what I want I don't think
[12:27:41] <shoky> jacta: :[
[12:27:55] <gnarf> ezakimak: the include feature of CSS you "desire" actually is going to be more problems than you want at this point... what you really want is to call a function every time you append new content so that you can add the classes to your buttons
[12:28:08] <jacta> It just show the two images above eachother shoky :\
[12:28:25] <shoky> jacta: start debugging.. 1st step: check your javascript console
[12:28:40] <Einzigare> Hello. I am looking for some help on a menu. http://pastebin.com/5W4XhAU1 trying to highlight the selected menu item. I set a session wide attribute in every page, but I have to click on the menu item several times before it lights up.
[12:28:50] <gnarf> ezakimak: either add ui-corner-all and ui-state-default to your HTML, or get a JS function to do it for you whenever you append content - your choice
[12:28:56] <Einzigare> If I click another item, sometimes the previous lights up.
[12:29:19] <Einzigare> I tried using the request attribute, but then sometimes it does not work at all.
[12:29:21] <ezakimak> gnarf, i understand those are my currently only two options. just wish css provided an elegant solution
[12:29:25] <shoky> Einzigare: this isn't #jsp
[12:29:30] <gnarf> ezakimak: it will work in every browser, and not rely on adding an inheritance step in css (which is already slow as shit)
[12:29:32] <jacta> shoky, Error: SyntaxError: illegal character - })(jQuery);​
[12:29:39] <shoky> jacta: there you go..
[12:29:51] <jacta> shoky, but what is? :\
[12:30:18] <Einzigare> shoky: well it is between jsp and jquery... using them both.
[12:30:19] <jkarsrud> jacta: Look at the code right in front of it, there might be somethign missing
[12:30:20] <shoky> jacta: i don't know. one thing could be that when copy/pasting from jsfiddle it sometimes adds an invalid invisible character :P
[12:30:22] <gnarf> ezakimak: even if the feature existed, it would be the wrong way to solve your problem
[12:30:41] <shoky> Einzigare: also using onclick is bad.. use jquery in a <script> tag
[12:31:08] <shoky> Einzigare: and i don't see any jquery there
[12:31:42] <ezakimak> i don't see why enabling code reuse, an age-old pattern, is a bad thing
[12:31:43] <Einzigare> oh weird, it only shows half my paste then
[12:31:54] <jacta> does it tell you anything, shoky / jkarsrud ? http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-08132012-093126pm.php
[12:32:08] <Gho5t> if I'm subscribing to an event such as this.bind('rendered', function(){ doSearch(); }); how can I unsubscribe this one event handler?
[12:32:19] <jkarsrud> not without the code jacta
[12:32:31] <gnarf> ezakimak: the issue is, you don't actually want "input[type=button]" to have those styles, you want your <input class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all" type="button"> to have those styles
[12:32:55] <gnarf> ezakimak: which wins - "input[type=button]" or ".ui-state-active"
[12:33:10] <ezakimak> no, I want to apply classes ui-state-default and ui-corner-all to all input[type=button]s
[12:33:25] <gnarf> ezakimak: so do that - in the HTML, where you add classes to elements
[12:33:44] <gnarf> asking CSS to be able to add classes that don't actually exist to elements seems like a stretch
[12:33:45] <jacta> jkarsrud, http://pastebin.com/SH4epbYf
[12:34:18] <shoky> jacta: try deleting the last characters there. i think it's just an invisible character that got put after the ;  (where it's pointing to)
[12:34:22] <gnarf> ezakimak: or, if you don't want to change your html, do that in your javascript whenever you add HTML to the DOM
[12:34:27] <Einzigare> shoky: http://pastebin.com/mtg5yiSp
[12:34:28] <ak> Gho5t: you can use namespaces
[12:34:46] <Einzigare> Dunno if it is related to the switch that the highlighting responds too late
[12:34:54] <shoky> Einzigare: that looks the same as before..
[12:35:08] <Gho5t> ak: i just need to name it right?
[12:36:02] <ak> Gho5t: .bind('click.name', handler)
[12:36:32] <ak> then you can unbind('click.name')
[12:36:38] <Gho5t> ok
[12:36:55] <Gho5t> actually that's not what I need
[12:36:58] <jacta> shoky, you're my hero <3
[12:37:00] <ak> hm
[12:37:10] <shoky> heehee
[12:37:10] <Gho5t> i want to unbind the one specific handler
[12:37:15] <Gho5t> I'll just name it
[12:37:18] <gnarf> ezakimak: thing is, CSS already allows you to "reuse" that chunk of code, it just requires that you actually tell it to reuse that block by adding the class to the HTML element...
[12:37:20] <jacta> my editor was supposed to show me then - it didnt :D
[12:37:40] <shoky> jsfiddle should fix that already ;P
[12:38:54] <gnarf> Gho5t: yeah - named function will unbind clean .on( 'click', named ).off( 'click', named )
[12:38:56] <wingy> is jquery touch similar to jquery mobile?
[12:38:59] <ezakimak> yes, but css doesn't let me reuse within css, say .c is .a and .b. i have to duplicate (not reuse) .a and .b to create my .c
[12:39:03] <wingy> i mean the same as
[12:39:19] <Gho5t> all right cool thanks
[12:39:34] <gnarf> ezakimak: no you don't you just add .c, .a {} and .c, .b {}
[12:39:51] <gnarf> ezakimak: done
[12:39:51] <Einzigare> shoky: http://nopaste.info/e2c9641fd9.html now it should work
[12:40:19] <ezakimak> but if .a and .b are defined by some other file, that I do not want to edit, I cannot do that.
[12:40:27] <ezakimak> (eg, jquery theme roller generated file)
[12:41:22] <gnarf> ezakimak: a css preprocessor solves this - you should be processing css to generate only one file anyway...
[12:42:18] <gnarf> ezakimak: also - I can agree that you "don't want to edit" the file, but then you should just use the classes in HTML and not worry about defining a .c
[12:42:23] * ezakimak is beginning to not like jquery css
[12:42:45] <ezakimak> can't apply the hover w/o doing so programmatically
[12:42:54] <ezakimak> or duplicating the style
[12:42:56] <shoky> Einzigare: i don't know what your jsp is injecting there and whether it's correct or not, how do you expect me to debug your issue?
[12:42:58] <gnarf> ezakimak: thats why you .button()
[12:43:05] <shoky> Einzigare: start debugging..
[12:43:20] <ezakimak> .button() is programatic...
[12:43:21] <b-ot> ezakimak, memorised “button()”.
[12:43:24] <gnarf> ezakimak: it takes care of the active/focus/hover states
[12:43:57] <gnarf> ezakimak: the jQuery UI css framework is designed to work with jQuery UI - and IE 6
[12:44:14] <gnarf> ezakimak: sorry if you are having "trouble" using it without using jQuery UI
[12:44:31] <shoky> Einzigare: your code is pretty horrible, looks like something from 10 years ago. keep your javascript seperate from your html. and your java seperate from your html and javascript
[12:44:34] <ezakimak> i am using some of jquery ui
[12:44:59] <gnarf> ezakimak: then use .button() to convert your buttons...
[12:45:08] <ezakimak> i'm not programmatically creating buttons
[12:45:13] <ezakimak> they are declared in html templates
[12:45:29] <gnarf> ezakimak: .find("input[type=button]").button();
[12:45:32] <gnarf> done
[12:45:53] <ezakimak> like I said, that is *programmatic*. i need to be able to hook into my template engine I guess,
[12:45:55] <gnarf> Thats why I wrote .newContent
[12:46:04] <ezakimak> same problem
[12:46:20] <gnarf> $("input[type=button]").newConent(function() { this.button(); });
[12:46:43] <gnarf> $( someHtmlFromATemplate ).appendTo( "body" ).newContent();
[12:46:51] <ezakimak> same problem.
[12:46:59] <gnarf> which is?
[12:47:08] <gnarf> too lazy to add a function call whenever you add content?
[12:47:14] <ezakimak> i need to hook into the template engine and call that when it's rendered
[12:47:33] <gnarf> not rendered, injected
[12:47:37] <gnarf> but yes
[12:47:41] <ezakimak> yes, added to the dom.
[12:47:41] <gnarf> you need to do this anyway
[12:48:00] <gnarf> for like - anything else - events, special form inputs, validation
[12:48:10] <gnarf> hence... newContent
[12:48:27] <gnarf> sometimes you can get away with delegating
[12:48:40] <gnarf> sometimes you need to operate on elements
[12:49:20] <shoky> ezakimak: if you're using knockout, there are custom binding handlers for jquery ui widgets, maybe you want to look into those
[12:49:37] <gnarf> stop trying to argue for lazy solution to the simplistic case and do it right...
[12:50:15] <shoky> (and i say that because he _is_ using knockout)
[12:50:48] <gnarf> I'm sure there is a way to hook an arbitrary callback into that chain then.
[12:51:01] <gnarf> which makes this even less of an issue
[12:51:16] <ezakimak> just have to find it...
[12:51:47] <ezakimak> using knockout is like a giant toolbox, all cluttered--you gotta dig for the right tool
[12:54:02] <Einzigare> shoky: what exactly do you mean? The whole function is jquery/javascript and I only use a scriptlet to read which is selected. It is surrounded by script tags, but omitted for bevity's sake.
[12:54:30] <gnarf> ko.bindingHandlers.myButton = { init: function( element ) { $(element).button(); } }; <input data-bind="myButton: true" type="button">
[12:54:46] <gnarf> ezakimak: 1 minute with the docs leads me to believe this does what you want ^^^
[12:54:48] <Einzigare> or the remove and addclass part is bad practise?
[12:54:49] <shoky> Einzigare: for example, you have javascript inside your html in the onclick attributes
[12:55:54] <MaxymiserTE> Hi. Does anyone know if it is possible to automatically change a dropdown to another value dynamically and "submit" that page automatically?
[12:56:23] <Einzigare> shoky: how should it be done neatly?
[12:56:44] <Einzigare> a href?
[12:57:47] <shoky> Einzigare: not using onclick attributes, but using a <script> tag that contains all your javascript/jquery code. for example:  $('#upload').click(function() { document.location.href = prefix + '/upload.html'; });
[12:57:47] <Einzigare> my teammates did it this way, I assumed there was a reason.
[12:58:04] <Einzigare> ah ok
[12:58:37] <MaxymiserTE> To clarify; my select box has an onchange event but i want it to have that value selected automatically (saved from a cookie value) and have the page load with those parameters
[12:58:59] <ezakimak> gnarf, didn't work.
[12:59:04] <LordThumper> MaxymiserTE: $("select").val("abc"); $("form").submit();
[13:00:00] <MaxymiserTE> I have it that the select box just uses the onchange event, no form tag
[13:00:18] <ezakimak> nm. it did
[13:00:24] <ezakimak> sort of
[13:00:52] <shoky> yep it works http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KXhem/20/
[13:01:18] <LordThumper> var value = $.cookie("test"); $("select").val(value);
[13:01:26] <MaxymiserTE> should it run on document.ready $(body).submit(), or does that work?
[13:01:42] <LordThumper> That's to change the value of the <select>
[13:01:55] <LordThumper> yes on document.ready
[13:02:16] <MaxymiserTE> $(select).submit(); or does it need form?
[13:02:28] <LordThumper> Do you want to submit the page?
[13:02:31] <LordThumper> To the server?
[13:02:44] <LordThumper> After changing the value?
[13:03:42] <LordThumper> The code I gave about retrieves value from cookie, and sets a <select> to that value
[13:03:46] <LordThumper> above*
[13:04:32] <LordThumper> I'm not sure if a page needs a <form> element
[13:04:47] <LordThumper> Try $("body").submit()
[13:04:53] <LordThumper> if you don't have a form
[13:05:09] <LordThumper> I think you need a form though
[13:05:45] <shoky> you need a form..
[13:06:20] <MaxymiserTE> if you go to http://dev3.maxymiser.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=20 take a look at the "show" field.
[13:06:46] <MaxymiserTE> that number is stored in the user's preferences and want to have it saved so they don't have to always change from the default
[13:07:14] <shoky> that's a redirect, not a submit
[13:07:18] <MaxymiserTE> it submits by adding &limit=15 for the 15 value
[13:07:25] <LordThumper> oh that is kinda awkward design
[13:07:34] <MaxymiserTE> yeah it is OpenCart.
[13:07:47] <LordThumper> well you can store that full url in the cookie
[13:09:06] <LordThumper> $("select:first").val("http://dev3.maxymiser.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=20&limit=15").change()
[13:09:24] <LordThumper> Give the select an id
[13:09:34] <LordThumper> And the url is retrieved from the cookie
[13:11:48] <MaxymiserTE> could i use $.load('http://dev3.maxymiser.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=20&limit=15');
[13:16:45] <robert_> so question, how does jquery call error handlers?
[13:18:00] <robert_> because I have code that works perfectly when used standalone, but does not work correctly when used in combination with $.get()
[13:19:04] <johnkpaul> robert_: what do you mean error handlers?
[13:19:07] <johnkpaul> ?ajaxerror @ robert_
[13:20:01] <jedimind> how do you put a bunch of objects inside one object, so you can iterate through it?
[13:20:27] <robert_> johnkpaul: http://jsbin.com/welcome/11668/edit <-- this works correctly, but when I use it with $.get(), it doesn't update a public variable
[13:20:35] <Ayush> anybody know how to make element on top when that element parent is position absolute ?
[13:21:22] <johnkpaul> robert_: what do you mean "public variable"?
[13:21:34] <johnkpaul> are you trying to set something on "This" inside of a ajax error handler?
[13:21:44] <Ayush> anybody know solution ?
[13:23:16] <johnkpaul> Ayush: ask #css
[13:23:43] <robert_> oh, that doesn't work?
[13:23:51] <robert_> johnkpaul: http://jsbin.com/welcome/11668/edit
[13:25:01] <Ayush> there is not way to make element on top using jQuery ?
[13:25:13] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn function.prototype.bind @robert_
[13:25:14] <b-ot> robert_, bind | Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[13:25:20] <Ayush> if parent is relative
[13:25:22] <johnkpaul> robert_: that's not how this works
[13:25:29] <robert_> hm
[13:25:29] <gnarf> ?jQuery.proxy
[13:25:31] <johnkpaul> you need to bind your error handler
[13:25:55] <johnkpaul> yes, jquery.proxy
[13:26:04] <johnkpaul> ^ @ robert_
[13:26:08] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy @robert_ johnkpaul
[13:27:19] <gnarf> robert_: and jQuery ajax callbacks are called within the context of the jqXHR
[13:28:14] <johnkpaul> robert_: rather than .fail(seal.failure) use .fail($.proxy(seal.fail, seal))
[13:28:33] <gnarf> johnkpaul: $.proxy( seal, "fail" ) too
[13:28:50] <robert_> http://jsbin.com/welcome/11684/edit
[13:28:53] <johnkpaul> ah, cool, didn't know about that signature
[13:28:55] <robert_> johnkpaul:
[13:29:12] <robert_> oh, I see.
[13:29:47] <robert_> or.. not.
[13:29:54] <gnarf> also robert_ - jQuery objects aren't transient
[13:30:25] <gnarf> robert_: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide27
[13:30:47] <gnarf> robert_: use http://api.jquery.com/data to store data on an element
[13:31:17] <gnarf> s/aren
[13:31:21] <gnarf> yeah whatever
[13:31:25] <robert_> yeah heh
[13:31:31] <robert_> s/aren't/are/
[13:31:32] <robert_> :p
[13:31:34] <gnarf> thx
[13:31:35] <gnarf> :)
[13:31:41] <robert_> yup. :D
[13:32:14] <robert_> so how do I get my current instance in there?
[13:32:32] <robert_> $.proxy()?
[13:32:58] <gnarf> robert_: if you proxy the function - "this" is going to be your "seal"
[13:33:31] <gnarf> robert_: also why the $(this) ? that doesn't seem like what you want compared to just "this." in the constructor
[13:35:09] <robert_> still coming up undefined
[13:36:35] <robert_> (gnarf)
[13:37:51] <gnarf> in the last console.log?
[13:37:53] <gnarf> of course it does
[13:37:57] <gnarf> ajax is ASYNC
[13:37:57] <gnarf> :)
[13:39:09] <gnarf> robert_: http://jsbin.com/welcome/11686/edit did my edit show up on yours?
[13:39:39] <robert_> oops, I was editing it just now :/
[13:39:41] <robert_> sorry heh
[13:44:58] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to use the infinite-scroll plugin and I'm running into a bit of an issue. I did some research and it seems like it looks at the next page selector only once then tries to adjust that url for the subsequent visits instead of looking at the next page selector on the requested page. Is there a way around this?
[13:45:20] <BillCriswell> subsequent pages* not visits.
[13:53:35] <BillCriswell> Awfully quiet in here...
[13:53:47] <faraway> ...
[13:53:59] <BillCriswell> I've never seen it this quiet haha.
[13:54:00] <faraway> but sorry don't know the plugin
[13:54:07] <fris> whats the best way of setting a default text input value based on a chained select, i have 2 selects, and want to set the value based on that right now im just doing an if, if ("car" == $("#type").val() && "bmw" == $("#site").val()) $("#id").val('1565');
[13:54:08] <BillCriswell> No it's cool I wasn't saying it cause of that.
[13:55:14] <robert_> gnarf: what edits did you make?
[13:55:36] <gnarf> robert_: i put the final console.log() in an .always()
[13:56:14] <robert_> $.always(console.log(...)); ?
[13:56:35] <robert_> (either your changes didn't show up or my jsbin copy obliterated them)
[13:56:38] <robert_> :/
[13:57:52] <robert_> oh
[13:57:53] <robert_> okay
[13:59:20] <BillCriswell> fris: I think I understand what you're asking. Are you changing it when the select changes its value?
[14:00:46] <medicineuk> Hi all I was wondering if anyone can help me with a simply code layout issue I'm having at the moment
[14:00:56] <medicineuk> I made a fiddle to explain it http://jsfiddle.net/aT3J6/
[14:00:57] <robert_> gnarf: like that?
[14:01:56] <gnarf> robert_: http://jsbin.com/welcome/11686/edit
[14:02:27] <medicineuk> I basically need to know how to make a variable editable and accessible across an object
[14:02:48] <robert_> oh, I see. .always() runs after everything else?
[14:05:43] <medicineuk> no one?
[14:05:49] <gnarf> robert_: nope
[14:05:59] <gnarf> robert_: callbacks are fired in the order they are attached
[14:06:09] <gnarf> .always( a ).fail( b ) will call a before b
[14:07:05] <robert_> ah.
[14:07:30] <saba> I've got a few elements (.x) which I do $(document).on('click', '.x', zz) on. Now, these .x elements lay inside element #y. When I delete #y with .remove() and subsequently .append() a new #y (exactly the same, not same source however) the click event fires twice for each .x
[14:07:40] <saba> Any suggestions?
[14:12:03] <Gho5t>  $('.grid-data-rows tr:visible').each...any reason why this still returns <tr>s with display:none?
[14:13:14] <saba> Gho5t: a guess, but might have something to do with CSS visibility rule. Eg visibility:hidden would help.
[14:13:35] <abletony84> I'm trying to adapt this multistep slide-to-the-left form from jsFiddle over to my own site: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/84prM/ => http://home.no/dwaynie/test/general_posting_global.html - can somebody spot what I've done wrong though?
[14:13:38] <Gho5t> it should check display:none too iirc
[14:14:15] <shoky> saba: did you call .on() again when adding the new #y ?
[14:14:48] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: Hmmm...
[14:14:52] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: Anything different if you try $('.grid-data-rows tr').is(':visible').each?
[14:15:03] <saba> shoky: no
[14:15:10] <Gho5t> .is returns a boolean so probably yes
[14:15:16] <Gho5t> i'll try filter
[14:15:18] <paul_irish> anyone know how to trigger change() such that all the bound handlers will run?   since it's a special.event it doesnt seem to behave normally
[14:15:20] <shoky> saba: then that shouldn't happen.. you've got something else going on
[14:15:35] <BillCriswell> Ah, duh.
[14:15:42] <saba> shoky: I think so too, I'm going for the *everything* approach but any idea would help
[14:16:27] <Gho5t> BillCriswell: no luck
[14:16:29] <Gho5t> maybe a bug
[14:17:17] <BillCriswell> What browser and what happens if you just try $('tr:eq(2)').css('display') ? Assuming 2 is a hidden one.
[14:17:31] <Gho5t> weird if I do console.log($tr.is(':visible')); within the loop it will say false
[14:17:37] <saba> Gho5t: sure nothing overrides display:none?
[14:17:55] <Gho5t> pretty sure. the row itself isn't visible
[14:17:55] <BillCriswell> <tr>s are mysterious sometimes.
[14:18:03] <Gho5t> that's what I'm thinking..
[14:19:52] <shoky> Gho5t: you're sure they have display:none at the time you're calling $(..) ?
[14:20:20] <Gho5t> I mean it's in a callback after that method that should be hiding them is finished
[14:20:21] <Gho5t> so it should be
[14:20:39] <Gho5t>  if($tr.is(':visible')){ works for some reason
[14:21:58] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: $('.grid-data-rows tr').filter(':visible') failed you?
[14:22:06] <Gho5t> yeah
[14:22:15] <BillCriswell> Strange.
[14:22:16] <shoky> can you pastebin your code..
[14:23:56] <Gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/qbg99/
[14:24:09] <Gho5t> check that out...fails in the fiddle too
[14:24:22] <shoky> fails?
[14:24:40] <shoky> what does it write for you
[14:24:44] <Gho5t> 2
[14:24:48] <shoky> in the console?
[14:25:10] <Gho5t> heh you're right
[14:25:17] <Gho5t> i was looking in the result
[14:25:21] <shoky> ;p
[14:25:22] <Gho5t> like a dork
[14:25:25] <Gho5t> 1 in the console : 0
[14:25:29] <Gho5t> hrm
[14:25:41] <Gho5t> oh well I guess it must be something else then thanks
[14:25:51] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: Good luck.
[14:27:28] <Gho5t> I. AM.IDIOT
[14:27:35] <Gho5t> that is all
[14:27:52] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: It's usually the case for us all!
[14:28:02] <Gho5t> : )
[14:32:46] <hmbg> help me out here, I was expecting the top coordinate to be 0 http://jsfiddle.net/mfTYn/2/
[14:33:33] <hmbg> how can I get the div to start at 0, regardless of the margin of the contained p?
[14:37:03] <tw2113> eh?
[14:37:14] <tw2113> hmm
[14:37:28] <ogk1000> is there a way to get all CSS attributes from an element?
[14:38:06] <BillCriswell> ogk1000: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/754607/can-jquery-get-all-css-styles-associated-with-an-element
[14:38:47] <BillCriswell> I can't wait to eat some chicken tonight.
[14:39:43] <BillCriswell> hmbg: Negative margins?
[14:40:01] <codepython777> if there is a error in post/get ajax, can i trap it using .error() of jquery. My backend returns error objects and status codes != 200 when errors happen-- which I would like to display using a global error handler.
[14:40:19] * jacta hi-fives shoky 
[14:40:40] <BillCriswell> hmbg: Ahhh, I see what you're saying now.
[14:41:07] <hmbg> BillCriswell: in my mind the div should be placed at top:0
[14:41:11] <hmbg> but it's not
[14:41:16] <hmbg> unless it has a top border
[14:41:21] <hmbg> which feels a bit hackish
[14:41:31] <codepython777> shoky: any suggestions on how to do error displays on the browser for a backend system that raises errors?
[14:41:41] <BillCriswell> hmbg: I agree. This is something that always bothered me as well. That or 1px padding.
[14:42:09] <Dejavu> hi - i can't finy my error - the class replacement "display:none --> display: inline" does not work: http://pastebin.com/NRTnv3BU :-(
[14:43:40] <BillCriswell> Don't understand why the p's top margin goes outside of the box. It never made sense to me.
[14:43:49] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/mfTYn/3/ example.
[14:45:14] <BillCriswell> hmbg: Think I figured something out... http://jsfiddle.net/mfTYn/5/
[14:45:48] <BillCriswell> hmbg: Good question for stackoverflow maybe?
[14:46:04] <Dejavu> BillCriswell, css-box modell - the background attribut are only between "border" - use padding ;-)
[14:47:01] <BillCriswell> Dejavu: Where would you use padding to get that report back 0 offset?
[14:47:04] <hmbg> BillCriswell: that overflow trick works like a charm
[14:47:24] <BillCriswell> hmbg: Yeah... still think the default is weird though!
[14:48:18] <tds5016> hi. I have an issue where I start an animation (with .effect("shake", {}, 150);) and I may actually remove the animated object before it finishes the animation...
[14:48:18] <BillCriswell> Duh... now overflow: visible makes sense to me vs hidden...
[14:48:36] <tds5016> when I readd the object, it's int he position of where I removed the element.
[14:48:47] <tds5016> is there a way to make it so that the element will be reset once the object is removed?
[14:48:48] <BillCriswell> I guess "overflow" is just padding and margins? Glad I get paid to do this shit.
[14:49:15] <hmbg> nah, overflow usually controls what happens when you have more stuff in the div than fits
[14:49:48] <hmbg> for divs with a set height
[14:50:39] <BillCriswell> hmbg: I knew that part, but if you do overflow: visible; it starts returning 10 again.
[14:50:57] <Lucky--> http://colorschemedesigner.com/ for those of us coders that get stuck doing front end work. This thing is bad ass.
[14:51:01] <BillCriswell> Damn internet, it's all voodoo.
[14:51:12] <Dejavu> w3c box model: The background style of the content, padding, and border areas of a box is specified by the 'background' property of the generating element. Margin backgrounds are always transparent.  ;-)
[14:52:17] <BillCriswell> Dejavu: It's still funky to me haha.
[14:52:38] <BillCriswell> So a margin is just like... a transparent background image?
[14:52:56] <Dejavu> no it you the parent-background
[14:54:02] <BillCriswell> Hmmm...
[14:54:37] <Dejavu> div#a background:transperent (initial) --> p(margin) background transperent too
[14:54:52] <BillCriswell> That's so weird for me to think about.
[14:56:07] <Dejavu> http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp
[14:56:14] <LindsayMac> really strange request, but does anyone know if you can add a doctype declaration to a website via javascript?
[14:56:53] <pifantastic> LindsayMac: nope, if there is no doctype, the browser creates one
[14:56:58] <BillCriswell> Dejavu: I think we may be talking about two different issues here haha.
[14:57:21] <Dejavu> ok - i think it is to late ;-) bye
[14:57:25] <LindsayMac> that's what I was afraid of..
[14:57:48] <LindsayMac> the client has a website that is a web application. STUPIDLY whoever wrote it did not define a doc type and is causing issues for IE with drop down menus and stuff..
[14:58:11] <shoky> codepython777: why not just check the error object and display the error somewhere?
[14:58:18] * shoky hi5 jacta
[14:59:15] <shoky> codepython777: oh you want to respond to non 200 statuses i see
[15:00:25] <shoky> codepython777: there's the 'statusCode' setting for $.ajax
[15:01:41] <shoky> codepython777: and there's ajaxError() ..
[15:02:13] <ogk1000> is there a cleaner way to wrtie this?
[15:02:15] <ogk1000> http://collabedit.com/j2kjv
[15:02:22] <FrozenFire> Can anyone suggest an elegant way to handle "Return" submission on textarea inputs as a form of progressive enhancement via Javascript?
[15:02:35] <FrozenFire> That is, hitting Enter while the textarea is focused causes it to submit the form
[15:02:41] <FrozenFire> Hitting shift-enter causes a newline
[15:02:59] <ogk1000> FrozenFire, you can bind the enter key on focus of textarea ?
[15:07:30] <codepython777> shoky: so you suggest doing error handling in each ajax/post/get instead of doing a global error handling function?
[15:07:43] <codepython777> shoky: The problem for me is that i can get tons of different types of errors from the backend
[15:10:04] <codepython777> shoky: I could just get a global function, and point ajaxError etc to it as well.
[15:12:11] * Atty chicks dig jquery!!!
[15:13:05] <shoky> codepython777: sorry i haven't done much with responding to diff http codes, i'm not the guy to ask ;p
[15:13:21] <ogk1000> FrozenFire, were u able to figure it out?
[15:13:47] <FrozenFire> ogk1000, Sort of
[15:13:54] <FrozenFire> Bound keyup of the textarea
[15:14:11] <FrozenFire> Still working out how to have it not add a newline when the enter key is pressed
[15:14:20] <codepython777> shoky: how do you handle $.post() errors for instance?
[15:14:39] <ogk1000> FrozenFire, use this to get keycode for enter http://jonathan.tang.name/files/js_keycode/test_keycode.html
[15:14:52] <FrozenFire> ogk1000, Yes, I'm aware of what enter is
[15:14:53] <codepython777> shoky: say you want to throw a exception from the backed instead of the regular json output you expect?
[15:14:53] <FrozenFire> 13
[15:14:59] <ogk1000> then u can steal my code here to help perhaps: http://collabedit.com/j2kjv
[15:15:13] <ogk1000> all of that goes after the doc ready
[15:16:06] <jwmann> Anybody here have any experience with $.localscroll plugin?
[15:16:35] <ogk1000> FrozenFire, u didnt visit the link lol :P
[15:16:40] <shoky> codepython777: i'd just output a json object with a status/error field
[15:16:54] <codepython777> shoky: and then pass it to an errorhandler?
[15:17:37] <jwmann> I'm trying to add the selected class to the clicked nav item but also add the class when navigating to the page with the #foo in the url
[15:17:55] <FrozenFire> ogk1000, No I had not. ;)
[15:17:56] <jwmann> Too much effort than it's worth?
[15:18:02] <FrozenFire> I've figured it out on my own, but thank you.
[15:18:28] <shoky> codepython777: i suppose, yeah
[15:19:28] <codepython777> shoky: I'll take a look, thanks.
[15:28:08] <jwmann> How do I check the url for a #foobar and then perform action based on that?
[15:28:27] <jwmann> usually applied at the end of the url
[15:33:58] <MistuhKurtz> jwmann, window.location.hash
[15:34:11] <jwmann> MistuhKurtz: Thank you!
[15:34:16] <MistuhKurtz> np
[15:34:40] <MistuhKurtz> if you need to use the hash extensively (like for deep-linking in an AJAX website/app), then I highly recommend Ben Alman's BBQ plugin
[15:34:56] <MistuhKurtz> he also has a hashchange event plugin if you just need a custom event for when the hash changes
[15:35:02] <MistuhKurtz> it's included in BBQ
[15:45:49] <jedimind> is there a way to find siblings which come only after current element in the dom ?

[15:47:12] <jedimind> is what i was looing for
[15:47:16] <ryanneufeld> there you go

[15:52:19] <zapsoda> http://www.ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/    for someone the main scrolls down to this: http://fennec.name/upload/fennecsite.align.png Any ideas why?
[15:53:52] <ryanneufeld> zapsoda: that background image is HUGE
[15:54:08] <zapsoda> Yes i know lol im going to compress it :P
[15:54:08] <ryanneufeld> zapsoda: also lipsum text?
[15:54:31] <imsky> lol what's this for
[15:54:47] <zapsoda> i never got the point of going to lora ipsum if i could justt copy and paste anything
[15:54:53] <zapsoda> and it would work the same
[15:54:55] <zapsoda> but still
[15:55:08] <zapsoda> any ideas why its leaving the extra white lines at the bottom?
[15:55:31] <abletony84> zapsoda: http://www.fiftyshadesgenerator.com/
[15:55:51] <ryanneufeld> zapsoda: sorry I don't
[15:56:01] <abletony84> i dont bother going to lorem ipsum either especially not when i got that
[15:56:09] <zapsoda> lol :P
[15:56:12] <abletony84> yo ryanne whats up
[15:57:03] <ryanneufeld> ntm
[15:57:31] <zapsoda> also when they resize the page the lines go away
[15:57:38] <zapsoda> even if they go back to the same size
[15:58:43] <ryanneufeld> there is something about the plugins and css you're using zapsoda. I'm not sure where that extra is coming from
[15:58:59] <ryanneufeld> my guess, is that you need to give it as specific size.
[15:59:19] <zapsoda> i kinda am
[15:59:20] <zapsoda>     $("#main").css("height", $(window).height()-$("#header").height()-$("#footer").height()-75);
[15:59:30] <zapsoda> thats on load and resize
[16:07:47] <ryanneufeld> zapsoda: but you've set your height to be 100% without setting your position
[16:07:54] <ryanneufeld> zapsoda: so... you haven't set it
[16:09:46] <ryanneufeld> zapsoda: watch this http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/110-quick-overview-of-css-position-values/
[16:09:49] <ryanneufeld> it might help
[16:17:46] <Codex> Hello
[16:45:19] <saimon69> hello there, is there a good snippet to detect if jquery is present and if not load it?
[16:47:40] <Bankzilla> saimon69: http://pastie.org/private/yl32kwd18erkrfbdnijyq
[16:48:29] <shoky> Bankzilla that won't work..
[16:48:51] <Bankzilla> works in my code base
[16:48:56] <shoky> Bankzilla: chrome for example has a global $ function
[16:49:48] <shoky> and that would fail if there are other libs using $
[16:50:19] <Bankzilla> can use this method anyways http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/load-jquery-only-if-not-present/
[16:50:47] <bakert> if i have $('body').on('click', '.myClass', myFunc); … is there any way to give that "one"-like behavior PER-.myClass instead of once for the entire body?
[16:52:25] <bakert> that is, i want the event handler to go away on a particular element when clicked, but not on all the others
[16:52:58] <shoky> bakert: function myFunc() { var el = $(this); if (el.data('clicked')) return; el.data('clicked',true); ... }
[16:53:18] <saimon69> bankzilla: my code is pretty big, do i have for the second method to repeat it in the two if ocnditions?
[16:53:44] <bakert> shoky: nothing built in though like one?  thanks.
[16:54:01] <Bankzilla> saimon69: use this method, seems more strong as shoky pointed out $ is default in chrome http://pastie.org/private/pv3nk7krhb8s0xn9igknvq
[16:55:15] <saimon69> lemme see
[16:56:15] <saimon69> but then i get a $ is not a function
[16:56:32] <saimon69> i want to control AND load the code AND execute it at once
[16:57:25] <Bankzilla> did you take my first pastie or second
[16:57:33] <saimon69> the second one
[16:57:48] <saimon69> do i have to do an else after that?
[16:57:59] <saimon69> testing on firefox
[16:58:31] <saimon69> am testing on localhost, so might be that the code is too slow to load in order to work
[16:58:53] <saimon69> am  trying to make a sort of self-building widget
[16:59:32] <Bankzilla> do an $(document).ready(function(){.....}
[16:59:41] <Bankzilla> ^ that should be the else statement
[17:00:03] <saimon69> hmm let me pastebin my stuff (not working fully  yet)
[17:02:29] <saimon69> http://pastie.org/4469280
[17:02:41] <saimon69> bankzilla: http://pastie.org/4469280
[17:05:27] <Bankzilla> whats this? saimon69 "translated in javascript from jQuery"
[17:06:16] <saimon69> forget about that comment
[17:06:48] <saimon69> was trying to redo one of the features in javascript but had to stop due to lack of time
[17:07:26] <Bankzilla> you know all your code is executed on page load, not document load?
[17:09:36] <saimon69> nope
[17:09:52] <saimon69> how do i make my code behave consistently?
[17:10:07] <saimon69> mean on how do i make that thing load and execute properly?
[17:10:46] <Bankzilla> wrap it in a $(document).ready()
[17:11:15] <Bankzilla> yours is getting executed and stops page load so it can run the js
[17:11:48] <saimon69> should put also all functions and vars inside the document ready?
[17:11:56] <saimon69> or just the main loop?
[17:13:00] <Bankzilla> http://pastie.org/private/tttaxnu3cri6ehggogag
[17:13:08] <Bankzilla> functions stay outside of document ready
[17:13:58] <Bankzilla> all vars getting set with default values, can stay outside document ready as well
[17:14:03] <saimon69> ok got it let me see
[17:14:29] <Bankzilla> I'm heading out to lunch now but good luck
[17:16:31] <saimon69> bankzilla: where is the closure for init?
[17:17:23] <Bankzilla> That's for you to decide, I left it at the end of the comment line. You should probably tidy up your code, as that's really hard to look at
[17:18:35] <Aristata> Can anyone help me make this more concise: recipientsInput.after("<div class='tag'><span>" + ui.item.name + "</span><a href='#'>&times;</a></div>")

[18:38:56] <Somatt> anyone can tell me what's wrong in there ? http://jsfiddle.net/gmsgV/
[18:39:43] <Somatt> simple $.inArray not working as expected o_O
[18:40:45] <johnkpaul> Somatt: it returns the index
[18:40:50] <johnkpaul> $.inArray returns an index
[18:40:56] <johnkpaul> if the index is 0, it is falsy
[18:40:58] <Somatt> doh
[18:41:00] <Somatt> thanks
[18:41:04] <johnkpaul> np Somatt
[18:42:47] <Somatt> why did they call it inArray if it returns indexOf and not a boolean ? sigh
[18:44:19] <johnkpaul> eh, Somatt, in general, I agree with better naming, but this is right in the docs of in array
[18:44:24] <johnkpaul> including the 0 being falsy thing
[18:44:33] <johnkpaul> 3rd sentence
[18:44:46] <Somatt> I know, I know... but still ;)
[18:44:57] * Somatt hides anyway
[18:45:09] <johnkpaul> :), don't worry, we've all made mistakes like this many times
[18:45:46] <johnkpaul> I bet it's one of those things that jquery couldn't change if it wanted to
[18:45:57] <johnkpaul> because too many things rely on it returning a number and not a boolena
[18:47:45] <gnarf> johnkpaul: ?
[18:48:12] <johnkpaul> $.inArray returning a number instead of a boolean
[18:48:18] <jrockjiggz> wouldn't is(inArray()) return bool?
[18:48:37] <gnarf> oh, honestly, I expected returning the index
[18:48:41] <johnkpaul> jrockjiggz: is is on a jquery object
[18:48:44] <gnarf> but i can see that too
[18:48:56] <johnkpaul> gnarf: yeah, me too, but that's only because I know how indexOf works
[18:49:09] <johnkpaul> someone new, looking at inArray, would probably expect it to be returning an array
[18:49:18] <gnarf> heh
[18:49:24] <johnkpaul> ha, a boolean
[18:49:27] <johnkpaul> not an array :)
[18:49:37] <gnarf> prolly, the name implies true/false kind of
[18:49:44] <johnkpaul> yeah
[18:49:45] <gnarf> but its like a rename of indexOf
[18:49:56] <gnarf> proxy -> bind too
[18:50:29] <johnkpaul> yeah, I forget about that one because of the luxury of working in modern browsers
[18:50:31] <gnarf> just slightly different, so we prefer not to use method names that are already part of JS
[18:50:40] <gnarf> johnkpaul: our issue is jQuery.fn.bind
[18:50:50] <gnarf> we used "bind" to mean something else
[18:51:03] <johnkpaul> yeah, that makes sense
[18:51:43] <gnarf> so, jQuery.inArray is similar [].prototype.indexOf --- jQuery.proxy is similar to Function.prototype.bind
[18:54:52] <gnarf> johnkpaul: did you see the rAF plugin?
[18:55:13] <johnkpaul> I did, but I didn't try it out
[18:55:39] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-requestAnimationFrame/blob/master/src/jquery.requestAnimationFrame.js - so nice ;)
[18:56:22] <johnkpaul> :) yeah, such a small bit of code to do something so awesome
[18:56:40] <samholmes> How do I prevent click handlers from triggering after a jQuery UI draggable
[18:56:41] <samholmes> ?
[18:59:08] <dogarrhea2_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGymr78FtbU so they go on for a while about how this new drug causes side effects (some of which include the condition which its trying to treat) and/or insanity/castration/aids/etc.  how is this legal?
[19:12:19] <lathan> ?anyone
[19:12:22] <lathan> Hello?
[19:12:25] <lathan> any questions?
[19:14:51] <haizum_> how can i have a page run some js after its been loaded from another page
[19:15:15] <haizum_> can i put like a .load event inside of a .click event or something?
[19:15:39] <haizum_> ie so i have a link
[19:15:41] <lathan> haizum_, you want to trigger code after being ajaxed in? but not on page load?
[19:15:47] <haizum_> yes
[19:15:58] <lathan> so page 1 does .load('page2') and page 2 runs code but not on regular load
[19:16:28] <lathan> haizum_, your best bet is to trigger a custom event after the .load on page1
[19:17:26] <haizum_> ya im using isotope on the home page to show my image gallery, with filter links at the top. when a user clicks on an image, it brings them to a single photo, but i still want to be able for them to use the filter links (which would bring them back to the home page, and then execute the necessary isotope code for filtering)
[19:17:26] <lathan> so .load('page2.html').trigger('contact_ajaxed')
[19:17:59] <haizum_> whats 'contact_ajaxed' ?
[19:18:09] <lathan> haizum_, a custom event
[19:18:21] <lathan> haizum_, you can bind and trigger to any string you want
[19:18:37] <lathan> haizum_, .trigger("myCustomEventThatYouWillNeverGuess")
[19:19:03] <haizum_> well its a click event
[19:23:55] <lathan> haizum_, wait, what?
[19:24:27] <lathan> haizum_, so you are go to page1, click that does a load('page2') and you also want to run a script on page2 (that doesn't run if page2 is browsed to)?
[19:24:33] <lathan> *you go
[19:25:02] <haizum_> go to my site
[19:25:09] <haizum_> http://www.richardbernardin.com/portfolio
[19:25:20] <haizum_> the links at the top are filters that only work if the user is on the home page
[19:25:26] <haizum_> so i disabled them if they go anywhere else
[19:25:41] <haizum_> but i want to enable them so that they bring the user back to the home page, and THEN do what they're supposed to do
[19:27:02] <lathan> haizum_, are you using a plugin for the gallery rotating?
[19:27:09] <haizum_> yes, isotope
[19:27:49] <haizum_> you mean the single page gallery? thats another plugin
[19:27:54] <haizum_> called portfolio slideshow pro
[19:27:59] <haizum_> im using wordpress
[19:28:09] <lathan> haizum_, okay...here's what you want to do: on your index page, you want to on doc ready, look for the hashtag, and link to that
[19:28:25] <lathan> so the page 2 links just do /portfolio/#Editorial
[19:28:38] <lathan> and page1 reads in the #Editorial and triggers a click on the Editorial link
[19:29:08] <haizum_> look for the hashtag?
[19:29:23] <haizum_> how would i tell it to do that
[19:31:14] <lathan> window.location.hash
[19:31:24] <lathan> haizum_, its the #*Editorial* part of http://www.richardbernardin.com/portfolio/#Editorial
[19:31:36] <haizum_> right
[19:32:19] <lathan> if you look for that on page load, then the 2nd page can just have plain links that include the #Editorial in the url, and the 1st page can see that and put that filter on
[19:32:41] <BillCriswell> I have some code that's working in Chrome and Firefox but not doing anything in IE and Safari... Any common gotchas there?
[19:32:53] <lathan> BillCriswell, extra commas in objects or arrays
[19:33:55] <haizum_> lathan: well i can make a different menu using the php "ishome" function
[19:34:04] <corpster> Hi.. Im using a jquery to make a row draggable.. and the helper to make a custom image to drag (rather than using the row to drag).. But the helper image is coming out at the first column of the row, which may be way away from the mouse pointer.. is there a way to set the helper div to display where the mouse cursor is?
[19:34:11] <lathan> BillCriswell, my best bet is to put a comment in and see where the error line number changes
[19:34:17] <haizum_> on any page other than home... thats how im using  a disabled menu now
[19:34:24] <BillCriswell> I'm not getting any errors though. =(
[19:34:30] <haizum_> but isotope needs the #Editorial with a hash in order to filter properly
[19:34:37] <lathan> haizum_, that sounds good....leave it in there
[19:34:51] <BillCriswell> I figured it out. Dammit.
[19:34:52] <lathan> BillCriswell, try putting alerts in sections of the code and verify that everything is running
[19:35:02] <lathan> BillCriswell, your own fault? hate that
[19:35:19] <BillCriswell> lathan: 9.9 out of 10 times it is my fault. =(
[19:35:24] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/E8rqq/
[19:35:39] <lathan> haizum_, if you make just the links that actually go to the/portfolia/#Editorial and don't catch them with javascript, then it will just go to the main page, and make your main page recognize the hash tag
[19:35:41] <BillCriswell> It seems like slice is destructive on some browsers and not on others?
[19:35:53] <BillCriswell> I think destructive is the word I want...
[19:36:20] <lathan> BillCriswell, that is the concept.....
[19:36:31] <haizum_> lathan: the links don't take you anywhere, they're not supposed to... they just activate the filter for each section
[19:36:31] <lathan> BillCriswell, but all the docs I see show it as returning a new Array
[19:36:56] <BillCriswell> lathan: Firefox and Chrome sort by what I want, IE and Safari do not, so weird.
[19:37:05] <haizum_> lathan: only on any page other than the home page do i want them to take you to home, and then act as if they were clicked on home. get it?
[19:37:08] <BillCriswell> At least I know the issue now.
[19:37:34] <BillCriswell> Maybe?
[19:38:16] <BillCriswell> Hmm.. no, seems to be the sort behaving differently.
[19:38:24] <BillCriswell> I'll just look at this in the morning I guess.
[19:39:11] <lathan> BillCriswell, good luck
[19:39:21] <haizum_> lathan: if that makes sense to you and you feel i'm just missing something maybe you can provide me with a jsfiddle of what you're trying to explain, because i'm having a hard time following
[19:39:31] <lathan> haizum_, yes, so if you are in the about page, they need to be real links, not the links that isotype controls
[19:39:41] <haizum_> ok
[19:39:43] <haizum_> i can do that...
[19:40:07] <haizum_> then i need separate events for those links?
[19:40:55] <haizum_> because the links will all take you to the home page
[19:41:10] <haizum_> i can give them all a unique class identifier
[19:41:14] <haizum_> and then bind events to them
[19:41:20] <haizum_> but what to put in the event?
[19:41:39] <haizum_> trigger?
[19:47:21] <BillCriswell> lathan: Thanks!
[19:48:04] <lathan> haizum_, here's the example as well
[19:48:09] <lathan> page 1: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/qeEzJ/4/
[19:48:16] <lathan> subpage: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/uCEy8/2/
[19:48:18] <azbyin> hi all.. does .animate() work with only css properties?
[19:48:59] <lathan> azbyin, api.jquery.com/animate/
[19:49:04] <lathan> azbyin, The .animate() method allows us to create animation effects on any numeric CSS property. The only required parameter is a map of CSS properties. This map is similar to the one that can be sent to the .css() method, except that the range of properties is more restrictive.
[19:49:15] <lathan> azbyin, w/out testing, I'd say yes
[19:49:41] <lathan> haizum_, if you look at subpage, clicking on any of the links takes you to the index page and the code runs to switch to that tab
[19:50:08] <lathan> haizum_, warning: if you update any of those, the links between the two files will get messed up (notice the /lathan/qeEzJ/4/show/#blah version number 4)
[19:52:19] <azbyin> $('body').animate({'scrollTop':100},1000);
[19:52:45] <azbyin> should that work? i just tried it on the api.jquery.com/animate page in the console and it did nothing
[19:53:32] <azbyin> ok, changing it to $('html').animate(...) works!
[19:53:40] <lathan> azbyin, no...scrollTop is a special function..... really?
[19:54:12] <azbyin> lathan, also can be treated as a property
[19:54:18] <snowfox_ben> Hey all. So, I am close…but not quite there: $('.main-content #sub-page-main li').not().parent('.paginate').each(function() { … }
[19:54:20] <lathan> ah...interesting
[19:54:28] <azbyin> which is why i asked whether .animate likes only pure css properties
[19:54:37] <lathan> snowfox_ben, .not doesn't reverse everything.
[19:54:48] <lathan> snowfox_ben, .not('div') is the same as .is(':not(div)')
[19:54:49] <snowfox_ben> I am trying to find LIs that are on that page but NOT belonging to paginate
[19:55:12] <haizum_> lathan: looking now
[19:55:30] <lathan> snowfox_ben, "belonging to paginate" is that a single parent/child distance or any number of levels?
[19:55:50] <snowfox_ben> parent.parent
[19:55:58] <snowfox_ben> parent().parent()
[19:56:09] <lathan> snowfox_ben, what you probably want to do is create your own custom filter:
[19:56:09] <lathan> .filter(function(){ return $(this).closest('.paginate').length == 0; })
[19:58:27] <snowfox_ben> hmm…squinting at that one...
[19:58:44] <lathan> lol
[19:58:47] <haizum_> lathan: whats the point of this line:         $('#isotype-gallery').html( $(this).attr('href') );
[19:59:07] <lathan> haizum_, that's just me mocking what isotype code would do
[19:59:15] <haizum_> ok
[19:59:16] <lathan> that's the stuff you already have
[19:59:29] <lathan> I don't know how you would trigger the isotype...but I'm guessing triggering the click would do it.
[19:59:37] <lathan> good luck, bye
[20:00:04] <haizum_> lathan: if you're on the home page though, those links will be static so why bother checking them
[20:00:20] <haizum_> there will be 2 diff. menus
[20:00:58] <haizum_> i think u could take out that whole first function no?
[20:08:27] <snowfox_ben> lathan, what does this mean? function(){ return $(this).closest('.paginate').length == 0;
[20:08:41] <snowfox_ben> return the list items that....
[20:09:04] <snowfox_ben> are NOT near .paginate?
[20:11:39] <jedimind> hrm
[20:11:55] <jedimind> if i set .data for a set of objects, how do i select one of those objects based on .data ?
[20:12:00] <jedimind> its not the same as data attribute
[20:20:59] <haizum_> lathan: you're a genius
[20:21:16] <haizum_> lathan: that windowl.location.hash bit of code was all i needed, works perfectly. thank you SO MUCH!
[20:21:36] <coldhead> great work everyone, take five
[20:23:07] <therealklanni> jedimind: if you use jQuery.data() it *is* the same as a data attribute, that's how jQuery stores the data. Just use a selector like $('[data-mykey="valuetomatch"]')
[20:23:39] <jedimind> uhm i dont think so, didnt that change in like 1.5 ?
[20:23:44] <jedimind> where .data is not the same as data- attr
[20:25:22] <Eviltwin> All of your .data() questions can be answered here: http://api.jquery.com/data/
[20:34:33] <gnarf> therealklanni: it reads its initial value from the attr, but it is not "stored" there
[20:34:57] <coldhead> http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[20:35:03] <gnarf> jedimind: I believe there is a :data selector
[20:37:36] <therealklanni> gnarf: must have been thinking of the older method as jedimind points out
[20:38:34] <gnarf> therealklanni: no version of jQuery data has worked differently, other than in the old days, it didn't read from data-* attrs
[20:41:04] <therealklanni> Must be misremembering it then
[20:41:09] <Jennifer23> Hi, I have html like <input name="item[0][0]"><br><textarea name="item[0][1]">, and i wrote events for input how can i handle the textarea data inside the input event? and i have several text areas, how can i handle this particular one?
[20:41:17] <therealklanni> You're saying it has never used the HTML5 data attribute?
[20:43:07] <gnarf> therealklanni: for storage yes, it has only ever read the initial value from the data-* attr
[20:43:35] <therealklanni> I suppose that's what I was misremembering
[20:44:18] <Eviltwin> The DOM's not really designed for active data storage
[20:44:46] <therealklanni> Probably why I never use this feature
[20:45:18] <Eviltwin> Except that .data() doesn't use the DOM as an active data store
[20:45:34] <Eviltwin> It doesn't store data in the DOM
[20:45:50] <therealklanni> Referring to reading it from the data attrib
[20:46:25] <Eviltwin> Reading's not as expensive as writing and it only happens once per element you use .data() on
[20:48:29] <therealklanni> Of course
[21:00:19] <Jennifer23> sorry, i'm ask my ques again, I have html code like <input name="item[0][0]"><br><textarea name="item[0][1]">, and i wrote JQuery events for input ,and i have several text areas, how can i handle this particular textarea in inside the input event?
[21:05:26] <Eviltwin> Jennifer23: So you're saying you only want to handle this particular <input> and <textarea>?
[21:05:31] <Eviltwin> Not any of the others?
[21:06:02] <Jennifer23> Eviltwin, yes
[21:07:44] <Eviltwin> Jennifer23: Do they have IDs or anything useful like that on them?
[21:10:02] <Jennifer23> Eviltwin, i have several input and textarea same name but different values, like <input name="v[0][0]"><br><textarea name="v[0][1]">,<input name="v[1][0]"><br><textarea name="v[1][1]">
[21:11:06] <Eviltwin> You can select those by name by doing $('input[name="v[0][0]"]') and $('textarea[name="v[0][1]"]')
[21:13:45] <Jennifer23> Eviltwin, no, i cant used name of this, becoz i add input field name is change, hence i cant handle textarea in input event
[21:14:20] <Jennifer23> i want .children or siblings like that
[21:14:40] <Eviltwin> .parent().children('input')?
[21:15:43] <Jennifer23> but i have <br> among them
[21:16:14] <someprimetime> bot-t has a voice?
[21:16:20] <someprimetime> give the people what they want
[21:16:30] <someprimetime> we want to hear your voice
[21:16:40] <Eviltwin> It's a helpful way to distinguish between bots and humans
[21:16:50] <someprimetime> i love bot-t
[21:18:30] <tw2113> <---bot
[21:20:26] <azbyin> nice try tw2113
[21:22:43] <VectorX> i like bot tw2114 better though
[21:26:04] <Eviltwin> Does tw2113 have all my shortcuts?
[21:26:16] <Eviltwin> ?cik

[21:27:38] <LordThumper> I used jQuery Ajax request to my local asp.net server fine
[21:27:47] <LordThumper> When I switched to live over https, it stopped working
[21:28:17] <LordThumper> error with readyState, status = 0
[21:28:26] <LordThumper> and statusText = "error"
[21:28:36] <LordThumper> I'm not even sure the request being sent
[21:28:40] <tw2113> Does not compute
[21:28:57] <LordThumper> is being*
[21:29:40] <Eviltwin> Are you trying to make a request from HTTP to HTTPS?
[21:30:03] <LordThumper> No the request should be HTTPS to HTTPS
[21:30:11] <Eviltwin> Or to an HTTPS server without a non-self-signed cert?
[21:30:57] <LordThumper> The digital certificate is valid (bought from some certificate authority)
[21:31:37] <LordThumper> When I tried to do an http ajax request to see clearly on Fiddler I got the Cross-origon error
[21:32:58] <LordThumper> Ajax used to work fine on this server, however I did some changes and I'm trying to find out what is happening
[22:00:00] <thealphanerd> anyone have much experience with aria?
[22:06:15] <Eviltwin> thealphanerd: Only a little
[22:06:40] <thealphanerd> trying to figure out if I can bind to aria based events
[22:06:49] <thealphanerd> I'm giving svg elements the aria role of button
[22:09:06] <thealphanerd> I have an on click event for the svg elements that works fine.  But if using a screen reader the enduser is interacting with a screen-redaer than they will be using the aria press event
[22:10:08] <Eviltwin> Doesn't that generate a click event?
[22:11:36] <Eviltwin> If it has a role="button"?
[22:12:22] <Eviltwin> Perhaps this article will help: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_button_role
