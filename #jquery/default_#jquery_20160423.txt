[00:10:12] <sadtaco> What's the cleanest way to turn something like 'scale(0.8)' or 'matrix(0.9, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0)' into 0.8?

[04:46:28] <Mrprocom> hi, I'm having a weird problem with checking if a string matches a regular expression, the regex is /^(\S+ .+(\n+)?)+$/g it's supposed to match the entire string if every single line is in the form of "oneWordOnly One Word Or More" so it matches "a b", "a b b" but not "a"
[04:46:58] <Mrprocom> when I input "a" and click the button, I don't get alerted that the string does not match the regex https://jsfiddle.net/wvqy7cav/
[04:47:25] <Mrprocom> but if I do it in the chrome console, it works perfectly fine http://puu.sh/osBcC/361b504fe3.png
[06:50:16] <safinn> How come `$('.class').get(0).text()` does not work? .text() is not a function
[08:27:20] <crucerio> Hi, I want to count how many elements this json file has got: {"1":{"0":"data"},"2":{"1":"moredata"}} . I read it with ajax dataType: 'json' but  "result.length" returns "undefined"
[08:28:57] <crucerio> although I can access the data using result[1][0]

[17:27:49] <Kazuto> My browser is blocking my script from issuing a GET request to an HTTPS site while I'm connected to my site via HTTPS. I've tried both "//" and "https://" at the beginning of the URL to no avail. It always says "Blocked loading mixed active content <address>" What do I do to fix this?
[17:28:59] <Kazuto> The code I have is `var json = JSON.parse($.get(<address>));` if it helps
[17:29:17] <systemfault> That cannot work.
[17:29:23] <systemfault> .get is async.
[17:29:57] <systemfault> But even when written properly... that wouldn't solve your HTTPS problem.
[19:12:20] <even> have somebody ever tried stream through livecoding or twitch?
[19:42:34] <ginhinio> hey guys I have two divs. and both of them I dynamically give them a background while the website is loaded. but only one of them actually change the background on chrome and the other one only changes its background on IE
[19:42:59] <ginhinio> I'm really confuesed as of how this could possibly happen
[19:43:51] <ginhinio> the background changing code of both are almost identical.
