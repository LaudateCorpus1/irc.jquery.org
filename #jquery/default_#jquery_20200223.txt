[01:53:46] <alturic> Hello. I know this is presumably one of the most beginner topics, but I'm trying to understand setInterval, functions, and promises. It could simply be late, but I'm looking to setInterval(makeAnAxiosRequest, 5000), but I don't want it to fire the function a second time unless and until the first call is complete.
