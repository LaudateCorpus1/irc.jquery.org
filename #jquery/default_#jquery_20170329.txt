[00:21:29] <sonu_nk> in this irc can i ask amchart issue ?
[01:12:24] <Rockwood> sonu_nk, its jquery thing ?
[01:14:32] <WhirledPress> could someone explain what this means? https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/8yuL7wc6/
[01:15:43] <WhirledPress> It is the begining of a plugin from Ariel Flesler, but I'm not sure what it does or what method "plugin" is
[01:15:50] <sonu_nk> its javascript this but i was asking if someone expert in this then we can solve.. Rockwood ..
[01:27:01] <WhirledPress> how do you determine the max scroll position of a scrollable div?
[01:32:22] <sonu_nk> scrollHeight - clientHeight WhirledPress
[01:32:41] <sonu_nk> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22675126/what-is-offsetheight-clientheight-scrollheight
[01:33:48] <WhirledPress> right on, thanks. I could only find window -contexts. This is perfect. Thank you.
[02:03:27] <sonu_nk> hi https://jsfiddle.net/opddknej/ i want to remove the all the wrapped parent div.its fail in doing this..
[02:04:38] <sonu_nk> Cork, hi hello
[02:05:34] <WhirledPress> sonu_nk, there is no parent element for #frmb-0 so nothing ever gets unwrapped
[02:06:04] <sonu_nk> id='frmb-0' has .minusHide parent div
[02:07:02] <Cork> sonu_nk: .minusHide is inside not a parent
[02:07:37] <sonu_nk> ok so to remove these all and get only #frmb-0 wht i need to do ?
[02:07:55] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/opddknej/2/
[02:08:01] <Cork> $('#frmb-0').empty()
[02:15:03] <WhirledPress> sonu_nk, did you mean that you just want the <div>content</div> inside of $frmb-0?
[02:15:07] <WhirledPress> like: https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/opddknej/2/
[02:15:35] <WhirledPress> sry, I meant https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/opddknej/3/
[03:27:34] <sonu_nk> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/opddknej/4/ here my fiddle i want to unwrap the <div id='frmb-0'>    content      </div> from .minusHide but with my script its only unwrapped with first parent...
[03:27:42] <sonu_nk> WhirledPress, ^
[03:28:48] <Cork> sonu_nk: https://jsfiddle.net/opddknej/5/ ?
[03:29:45] <sonu_nk> unwrap() will not work in this ?
[03:30:15] <Cork> unwrap takes the current element .parent().prepend(this); .parent.remove()
[03:30:26] <Cork> so it basically does the same thing
[03:30:35] <Cork> you can run .unwrap a bunch of times if you prefer
[03:30:48] <Cork> but it is less code and less dom modifications to do what i did
[03:31:03] <sonu_nk> your solution best
[03:31:12] <Cork> one more question though
[03:31:19] <Cork> you want to keep #block?
[03:31:53] <Cork> sonu_nk: else this is what you want https://jsfiddle.net/opddknej/6/
[03:32:22] <Cork> ... wrong direction >_<
[03:32:34] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/opddknej/7/
[04:52:15] <itsgokul> what does this mean
[04:52:17] <itsgokul> $(this).data('content');
[04:52:45] <dni-> get the attribute data-content="blabl2" from the element
[04:53:06] <dni-> so this would return "blabl2"
[04:53:38] <dni-> html element ;)
[05:00:38] <Cork> it's a bit more complicated then that actually
[05:01:04] <Cork> .data() grabs the key 'content' from its internal data store associated with the element in question
[05:01:32] <Cork> if the store is empty it checks if there is an attribute with data-<key name> on the element and if it exists import that into the store
[05:02:13] <Cork> the difference is: if you've called .data('content') and later modifies the data-content attribute
[05:02:22] <Cork> .data('content') WON'T reflect the new value
[05:09:18] <itsgokul> ok
[05:15:00] <itsgokul> i need some help in implementing history.push ,see https://pastebin.com/C0szS5Vt
[05:19:45] <Cork> itsgokul: what's the question?
[05:20:09] <itsgokul> when i hit browser back button after ajax request nothing happens
[05:20:40] <itsgokul> i want browser to remember history for that using history api
[05:25:40] <Cork> itsgokul: the history.pushState triggers a reverse event in the page when the history entry gets recalled
[05:25:51] <Cork> itsgokul: so js has to handle it and do the changes needed
[05:26:21] <Cork> itsgokul: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/popstate
[05:26:51] <itsgokul> i load page1 in div then page2 in div but when i click browser back button page1 wont show
[05:27:11] <itsgokul> on action anchor link in page1
[05:27:24] <Cork> itsgokul: yes, again js has to bind the popstate event, and when that even fires fetch page1 and replace page2 with it
[05:27:52] <Cork> pustState does NOT mean "store current state of the dom and recall it later"
[05:28:38] <Cork> eh... *pushState :D
[05:29:07] <itsgokul> i need some examples
[05:29:28] <itsgokul> i have never done this before
[05:31:44] <Cork> itsgokul:  on('click', $('#content').load('page1').done(function() { history.pushState({}, 'Page 1', 'page1');  }); window.addEventListener('popstate', function() { $('#content').load(location.href); });
[05:31:53] <Cork> psudo code but that's basically it
[05:32:38] <Cork> in text, you need to bind the popstate event and do the ajax load of the old page
[05:33:43] <itsgokul> but how will get post values of old page
[05:34:08] <Cork> in your case it looks like you store it in the hash of the url
[05:35:00] <itsgokul> no its pased though get_Studentajax
[05:35:13] <Cork> alternatively you can store it in the state object (first argument to pushState) and grab that from the event.state
[05:35:25] <Cork> itsgokul: the point is, you have to store it, one way or another
[05:35:44] <Cork> cause it isn't handled magically
[05:36:57] <itsgokul> ok i will try
[06:06:19] <itsgokul> how can i get push state values on window.pop
[07:09:00] <Cork> itsgokul: it should be in the first argument to the callback function
[07:09:13] <itsgokul> got it
[07:20:17] <WebDevB> Hey guys, could anyone help me on this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43091824/abide-foundation-on-valid-form it's driving me mad.
[07:43:32] <itsgokul> im currently using pushdata after ajax (#div).html
[07:44:51] <Cork> pushdata?
[07:52:04] <itsgokul> popstate retuning null
[07:53:38] <Cork> itsgokul: yes, when you get to the first history entry there are no state so it is null
[07:53:45] <Cork> (the one you didn't create)
[07:55:04] <itsgokul> history.push not working inside ajax
[07:56:12] <itsgokul> i do$("#2").html(msg) now hidden hield inside msg contain variable value to previous page
[07:57:39] <itsgokul> for that i did history.push after .html(msg)
[07:57:52] <itsgokul> but value is null
[08:06:30] <Cork> itsgokul: your missing the point
[08:06:42] <Cork> itsgokul: pushState has no relation with the dom at all
[08:07:13] <Cork> when you push a state you push a new entry in the browsers back history, that's it, not other reference to anything
[08:07:37] <Cork> so what you need to push is the relevant data for the new page
[08:08:02] <Cork> when the popstate happen you have to handle the situation when you back through all the history and get to the first entry
[08:08:15] <Cork> cause then you are at the browsers own history entry, and it has no data
[08:08:29] <Cork> and then you have to call the same function you would to get the original page
[08:08:32] <Cork> (statically)
[08:08:39] <itsgokul> how will i get value of id for previous page
[08:08:47] <Cork> alternatively you can call history.replaceState on page load
[08:08:58] <Cork> and push in the "original" state there
[08:09:15] <Cork> itsgokul: the previous state you get in the event handler
[08:10:03] <itsgokul> when pushing i push value of id of next page or previous page
[08:10:20] <Cork> when you push you push what the "new" page is
[08:10:33] <Cork> when you pop you get what the old page was
[08:11:21] <itsgokul> ok
[08:35:51] <itsgokul> on third page pushdata value is getting saved but when popping it returns rull
[09:04:00] <Caspan> pooping?
[09:04:07] <Caspan> haha
[09:48:09] <MagnusVortex> there's definitely a lengthy setup that could be made about popping with an extra zero and getting po0p
[09:48:41] <MagnusVortex> but it'd be difficult to balance the amount of wasted time with the effectiveness of the punchline
[09:49:15] <MagnusVortex> and avoid getting popped/po0ped in the face
[10:05:48] <DelphiWorld> hi people
[10:05:53] <DelphiWorld> i have a mimtype issue in #FF
[10:05:58] <DelphiWorld> jquery blocked due to MIME type mismatch
[10:11:31] <saini> hello
[10:11:53] <saini> why does jquery mobile requires jquery 1.11 instead of 3.x ?
[10:12:26] <saini> my jquery mobile widgets arent working without including jquery 1.11
[10:13:27] <saini> also jquerymobiile breaks my bootstrap navbar
[10:13:41] <Cork> saini: prob cause they haven't stopped using some of the removed functions from jquery 1.x/2.x
[10:14:12] <Cork> saini: but also note 1.x, 2.x and 3.x are all supported "latest" versions
[10:14:25] <Cork> 3.x isn't "better" in that sense
[10:14:46] <saini> Cork: but what if I am using 3.x ? can i use both 3.x and 1.x in same project/file?
[10:15:01] <Cork> eh, you should avoid that
[10:15:17] <Cork> but just ripping 3.x out and replacing it with 1.x should work fairly well
[10:15:19] <saini> then..whats the solution ? i need to use 3.x too
[10:15:24] <saini> ok
[10:15:58] <Cork> the only directly not backwards compatible i can think of is that 1.x $.Deferred isn't Promise compatible
[10:16:38] <saini> Cork: one more problem, jquery mobile is breaking my bootstrap navbar
[10:17:02] <Cork> saini: ya, jquery-mobile is a beast that expects to control the entire site
[10:17:19] <Cork> (and is why i opted not to use it when we created a mobile site a few years back)
[10:21:50] <MagnusVortex> what's the cliff notes on $.Deferred and Promises? I've not used them and don't know what I would use them for.
[10:22:17] <DelphiWorld> Cork: any iidea about my mimtype issue?
[10:23:14] <Cork> MagnusVortex: $.Deferred is what you use when you do $.ajax().done().fail().always()
[10:23:35] <Cork> DelphiWorld: could you be a bit more specific?
[10:23:52] <DelphiWorld> i am developing a app that use jquery, using gulp
[10:24:04] <DelphiWorld> i always get mimtype error in browser console, and the scrypt dont load
[10:24:22] <Cork> from what
[10:24:30] <DelphiWorld> firefox
[10:24:33] <DelphiWorld> using gulp serve
[10:26:48] <MagnusVortex> Cork: I thought those were just closures...
[10:28:06] <MagnusVortex> Okay then, so what's a promise?
[10:36:13] <FilipNortic_> MagnusVortex: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
[10:37:46] <FilipNortic_> promises are the more broad js concept and not just jQuery there is $.promise() is sort of something else (and sort of not)
[10:41:03] <bjsnider> is there any difference between doing document.ready and then creating an anonymous function, and writing a named function and running that funtion with $(document).ready(myfunction); ?
[10:53:28] <FilipNortic_> bjsnider: you might have to pass jQuery to that function depending on the closure/context
[11:02:34] <dbclk> quick question..is there a UI repeater for jquery?
[11:15:27] <Cork> MagnusVortex: was away, promise is the same thing "basically" just natively to javascript
[11:15:41] <Cork> MagnusVortex: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
[11:16:25] <Cork> dbclk: repeater?
[11:16:34] <dbclk> yes like element repeater
[11:16:54] <dbclk> similar to passing in an array of objects and it generates repeated elements @ Cork
[11:17:34] <Cork> bjsnider: no, func(function() {}); and function myFunction() {} func(myFunction); is identical in javascript
[11:17:55] <Cork> (except the later function has a name)
[11:18:18] <Cork> dbclk: you could use .clone() ?
[11:18:42] <dbclk> hmm
[11:18:46] <Cork> if the elements you clone has javascript "bound" to them it won't work though
[11:19:07] <Cork> as the new elements won't be the same elements the javascript keeps as reference in its variables
[11:19:36] <Cork> so most of jquery-ui would break for example
[11:20:32] <Cork> anyway got to run
[12:27:41] <guideX> gah this is killing me, what am I doing wrong here? my .after won't work :( https://jsfiddle.net/L78osLcx/
[12:28:25] <robertmaxrees> adding jquery and rerunning throws an error.
[12:29:08] <guideX> oh hrm, some of my code is missing
[12:29:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L78osLcx/1/
[12:30:11] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting to happen?
[12:30:21] <guideX> it looks like it's working in jsfiddle, but not on my page
[12:30:28] <guideX> I expect two new buttons to appear
[12:30:30] <robertmaxrees> any errors on your page?
[12:30:36] <guideX> nope no js errors
[12:31:00] <robertmaxrees> so you get those console logs?
[12:31:06] <guideX> yes sir
[12:31:36] <guideX> also $("#pagination_previous").length gives 1
[12:31:43] <robertmaxrees> that'll always give 1.
[12:31:52] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you do console.log($("[id='pagination_previous']").length) instead?
[12:31:57] <robertmaxrees> well, 1 or 0.
[12:34:05] <zampa> so Im playing around with jquery and i'm trying to prepend two html tags to something. But only the first one seems to get added.
[12:34:16] <zampa> $('#messages').prepend($('<li>', '<div class="chat-local-error">' )); is the code i can see the li, not the div.
[12:34:52] <zampa> was checkiing on jquery/prepend but from what i can tell i do what i should be doing?
[12:35:05] <robertmaxrees> zampa it's odd to try to prepend an li on something.
[12:35:12] <robertmaxrees> since it should already be an li.
[12:35:55] <robertmaxrees> zampa are you trying to wrap that element in those?
[12:36:01] <taplar> that jquery object with two elements looks weird to me
[12:36:08] <zampa> that line triggers when i get a chat mesage so i create a new li for the ul.  Really had no idea how to do it otherwise.
[12:36:26] <zampa> im basically just trying to add li and div to an ul so i can style the messages that comes in.
[12:36:27] <robertmaxrees> taplar you can technically do that, but it's probably confused about how to handle the tags in this case.
[12:36:44] <robertmaxrees> zampa ah, so you want to append an li to a ul?
[12:37:06] <zampa> Yes.
[12:37:14] <zampa> And then an div so i can style the text.
[12:37:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd just use $('ul').append(theFullMarkupHere)
[12:38:29] <zampa> Oh that worked. didnt know it did.
[12:38:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:38:45] <zampa> i can add the <li><div> in the same argument cool.
[12:39:07] <robertmaxrees> with the closing tags.
[12:39:14] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it's going to try to close stuff for you.
[12:39:34] <zampa> so far i have let it close for me as the only other thing i need to do is .text(msg)
[12:39:44] <zampa> and it closes it correctly.
[12:39:44] <robertmaxrees> you can just do it all in one go instead.
[12:40:00] <robertmaxrees> .append('<li><div>some text here</div></li>')
[12:41:18] <guideX> ah ok
[12:41:21] <guideX> thanks i'll try it
[12:41:22] <zampa> might have to do that.. $('#messages').prepend($('<li><div class="chat-local-error">').text(msg)); as this didnt work :D
[12:41:32] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:41:39] <robertmaxrees> heh yeah.
[12:41:48] <robertmaxrees> because prepend doesn't return what you think it does.
[12:41:52] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep prepending it btw?
[12:42:06] <taplar> and the closing tag hatred
[12:42:10] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[12:42:13] <robertmaxrees> include the closingtags.
[12:42:20] <robertmaxrees> it makes life a lot easier.
[12:42:26] <zampa> Well it closes it for me. thats why i never included it.
[12:42:32] <robertmaxrees> you should do it anyway.
[12:42:45] <robertmaxrees> be explicit instead of implicit.
[12:42:51] <taplar> less guess, less mess
[12:43:03] <robertmaxrees> or at least easier to understand mess ;)
[12:43:53] <guideX> console.log($("[id='pagination_previous']").length); = 1
[12:44:16] <robertmaxrees> guideX and you put that right before the other code?
[12:44:36] <guideX> right before the append
[12:44:48] <guideX> err the after
[12:45:05] <zampa> I guess i can try prepending everything at once instead..
[12:45:32] <robertmaxrees> zampa that's generally what you want to do.
[12:45:50] <robertmaxrees> guideX and you don't have other code replacing that section or anything?
[12:46:15] <guideX> yes I do
[12:46:15] <guideX> lol
[12:46:23] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[12:46:24] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[12:46:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:46:30] <guideX> I was removing the buttons I added further down *smacksface
[12:47:14] <guideX> well cool thx
[12:47:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah def. glad you figured it out.
[13:29:24] <hoder> How can I check/update a variable on click of an element? I tried using a .click() function, but it gives me a scoping issue
[13:29:59] <pavonia> What exactly have you tried?
[13:31:30] <hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/1pcu98gp/1/
[13:32:20] <hoder> I marked the area that gives me a scope issue, I need to check the div since I am filtering between 3 divs. If you click div 2, it should filter in div 2 (based on grabbing it's id)
[13:35:25] <taplar> ;n 7 and 11 are the same no?
[13:35:32] <taplar> *ln
[13:36:31] <hoder> so i check once to return #id filter-container, right? but then if they click to div 2, i need to chekc again to get #id2 filter-container
[13:37:18] <taplar> i see nothing in this for an #id and #id2
[13:37:43] <taplar> only getContainerId which in this logic does not change
[13:37:48] <hoder> in get containerid
[13:38:10] <taplar> which is never changed after it is set, from what this snipplet shows
[13:38:18] <hoder> I'm checking for '.current-tab' id, that would be theoretically id1 or id2
[13:38:25] <taplar> ho?
[13:38:27] <taplar> how?
[13:38:36] <taplar> where is it changing?
[13:38:43] <hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/1pcu98gp/2/
[13:38:44] <hoder> my b
[13:39:09] <taplar> var makes it scoped to that closure
[13:39:09] <taplar> take it off
[13:39:15] <hoder> when you click 'div' it assigns 'current-tab'
[13:39:30] <robertmaxrees> right - remoe the var keyword
[13:39:34] <robertmaxrees> *remove
[13:39:43] <hoder> from the click, or both?
[13:39:48] <robertmaxrees> from the click
[13:39:55] <hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/1pcu98gp/3/
[13:40:00] <taplar> the click
[13:40:23] <taplar> does the issue persist?
[13:40:36] <robertmaxrees> but now $('#' + getContainerId + ' .filter-buttons').on('change', function(jQEvent) { won't work after the user clicks.
[13:40:42] <robertmaxrees> at least not the way you expect.
[13:41:45] <taplar> why not just look up the id in that change event handler?
[13:41:48] <hoder> no, it still grabs the same id
[13:42:07] <robertmaxrees> hoder only on pageload.
[13:42:25] <robertmaxrees> after that, the handler doesn't update.
[13:42:30] <hoder> Yeah, but I need to do it anytime they click a div
[13:42:39] <mariacheline> Hey everyone
[13:42:41] <taplar> why?
[13:42:59] <hoder> because I have 3 tabs, and need to filter seperately on all 3
[13:43:12] <hoder> so I figured it would be best to target the containers using the current-tabs id
[13:43:13] <taplar> that's not telling me why the logic needs to do that
[13:43:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to make the click binding generic and check the id within it.
[13:43:37] <taplar> why is it necessary to store that id in a var when a div is clicked?
[13:43:54] <hoder> I guess i could just grab the id on click?
[13:43:59] <robertmaxrees> boom
[13:44:18] <taplar> change you mean i assume
[13:44:37] <hoder> but my change event and click event are for 2 different things
[13:45:02] <taplar> other than the initialization, where is that variable used?
[13:45:04] <hoder> change is for the filter buttons, click is for the tab the filter exists on
[13:45:06] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the click handler at all.
[13:45:21] <robertmaxrees> all it's trying to do is define a variable.
[13:45:23] <taplar> ^^^
[13:45:29] <robertmaxrees> but you don't need that variable in the first place.
[13:45:36] <taplar> $('.current-tab').attr("id");  is not related to the div click contextually at all
[13:46:39] <taplar> in this case your creating a stateful variable for a field that is already stateful in the browser
[13:46:52] <hoder> I wouldnt be doing it within that change event though
[13:46:59] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[13:47:04] <taplar> ln 22
[13:47:22] <robertmaxrees> put differently, what does the ID have to do at all with the ID?
[13:47:33] <robertmaxrees> err, the change handler.
[13:47:34] <hoder> added tab function: https://jsfiddle.net/1pcu98gp/4/
[13:48:14] <hoder> I need to pick up which id is clicked on the tab menu so I can define the container better
[13:48:25] <robertmaxrees> "define the container better"?
[13:48:43] <hoder> the div that holds the elements I want to filter
[13:48:47] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:48:49] <hoder> '.filter-container'
[13:48:51] <robertmaxrees> you don't need it.
[13:49:05] <hoder> Why wouldn't I?
[13:49:22] <taplar> .current-tab marks the one you can fetch later when you need to use it
[13:49:23] <robertmaxrees> you're not using that ID for anything other than defining a handle.
[13:49:42] <MagnusVortex> "; = 1"?
[13:49:49] <MagnusVortex> whoa, sorry
[13:49:53] <MagnusVortex> hadn't scrolled down far enough
[13:50:10] <hoder> Yeah I can scope it down on load using current tab, but after someone clicks, it won't recheck which is current-tab
[13:50:40] <taplar> right, isn't that the issue?
[13:50:48] <hoder> yeah
[13:51:30] <taplar> are there multiple filter containers?
[13:51:55] <hoder> yeah, there are 3, all have the class 'filter-container'
[13:52:10] <taplar> so... line 9 is only going to initialize one
[13:52:35] <hoder> which is why I wanted to check off of current tab, then update as someone hopped through the tabber
[13:52:38] <taplar> i guess line 18 should initialize the others.
[13:52:41] <hoder> you can only see 1 at a time
[13:53:00] <taplar> so find the container any time the element changes
[13:53:07] <taplar> when you actually need the container
[13:56:04] <hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/1pcu98gp/5/  Like this?
[13:56:14] <hoder> or is there a different way to go about it?
[13:56:39] <taplar> yes, however you also need to fetch the id again
[13:57:06] <hoder> Do i need a new var to fetch? or can I just write it out?
[13:57:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1pcu98gp/6/
[13:58:30] <taplar> the on change binding is probably still an issue, but that should find the active element your wanting to work with
[13:59:10] <hoder> Still shows the original container unfortunately
[13:59:51] <hoder> http://bit.ly/2obtv6C    I checked in console for '$container'
[14:00:31] <taplar> what do you mean you checked the console?
[14:01:04] <hoder> clicking a tab, then checking for $container  was repeating the same div
[14:02:04] <taplar> after you change tab, console.log($('.current-tab').attr("id"));
[14:03:57] <taplar> are you expecting when you click a tab that the filter buttons will change?
[14:04:00] <hoder> it's logging the previous element
[14:04:05] <hoder> no
[14:04:08] <mariacheline> Hi, how can I achieve this behaviour when you click notify it shows the form.. is there such plugin or how do you call this action?  Here's the link https://hencework.com/theme/pogody/slideshowwithanimatedgradient/index.html
[14:04:18] <mariacheline> Please help
[14:04:34] <hoder> the filter buttons are 3 ones, but I need to be able to filter through a specific tab
[14:04:40] <duch_kazatel> mariacheline you mean a modal?
[14:05:33] <taplar> hoder: a fiddle showing the issue would be super helpful
[14:05:47] <hoder> Did you see my bitly link?
[14:05:58] <hoder> I'll try to recreate a fiddle, one moment
[14:06:15] <taplar> the bitly is a full page.  that's asking me to dig through your code
[14:06:21] <mariacheline> I'm not sure what you call that, i'm new to javascript. I'm talking about the 'notify me' on the left. When you click it, it shows the form
[14:06:34] <taplar> we all have our actual jobs we also have to take care of, :)
[14:06:35] <mariacheline> duch_kazatel
[14:06:47] <mariacheline> how can I achieve that
[14:06:53] <duch_kazatel> mariacheline are you using bootstrap?
[14:07:00] <mariacheline> I'm not
[14:07:13] <robertmaxrees> any frontend library at all?
[14:07:17] <mariacheline> Is that modal? duch_kazatel
[14:07:23] <mariacheline> I'm not using modal
[14:07:36] <mariacheline> I though modal is something that pops up
[14:07:44] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline then what do you need?
[14:08:08] <Uhkis> it's as simple as $('container').html(newhtml);
[14:08:10] <robertmaxrees> to just show the form?
[14:08:39] <mariacheline> robertmaxrees i'm asking how to achieve the behaviour when you click notify and it shows the form https://hencework.com/theme/pogody/slideshowwithanimatedgradient/index.html
[14:08:42] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you chould just set a hide class on it that's display: none; and then use .removeClass('hide') on it.
[14:09:01] <mariacheline> Oh.. really..
[14:09:09] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline re-linking to the page and describing it the same way doesn't usually help ;)
[14:09:14] <mariacheline> Yea
[14:09:24] <robertmaxrees> but if you just need to show it, then do that
[14:09:32] <mariacheline> But i've already ask and then you asked again what do i need
[14:09:51] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline because your original request isn't very clear ;)
[14:09:55] <mariacheline> So i thought maybe you didnt see or get
[14:09:58] <robertmaxrees> but if you just need to show a form, just show it.
[14:10:21] <mariacheline> Add class should do?
[14:10:43] <robertmaxrees> define a class like .hide { display: none; }
[14:10:47] <hoder> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/1pcu98gp/9/
[14:10:48] <robertmaxrees> stick that class on the form in your html
[14:10:55] <mariacheline> But it's like it's replacing the text
[14:11:00] <robertmaxrees> then use removeClass('hide') when you click that button.
[14:11:19] <robertmaxrees> wait you want the full animated effect and all of that?
[14:11:46] <mariacheline> I think i can use the animate.css for that.. i just want the dynamic part
[14:12:01] <robertmaxrees> then you want an event handler that fires off whatever stuff you wnat.
[14:12:52] <mariacheline> On click?
[14:13:05] <mariacheline> It changes the state of the button too
[14:13:18] <robertmaxrees> you can fire off whatever logic you need in on click
[14:14:57] <mariacheline> Then I should place the form where the text is placed but hide it first then display on button clicked?
[14:15:11] <robertmaxrees> and hide the other text, yeah
[14:15:24] <robertmaxrees> that'll just straight swap between the two.
[14:15:37] <mariacheline> Alright.. i got confused there
[14:15:44] <mariacheline> Thanks robertmaxress
[14:15:49] <mariacheline> robertmaxrees
[14:16:17] <mariacheline> I read that you can't really animate display property?
[14:16:42] <robertmaxrees> you can animate other properties.
[14:16:49] <hoder> mariacheline if you want a fade, you can animate opacity
[14:17:12] <robertmaxrees> lots of animation options.
[14:17:26] <mariacheline> hoder, i've tried that trick it still gets on the way
[14:17:43] <mariacheline> robertmaxrees i guess animate css would do, i'll try
[14:27:41] <robertmaxrees> you'd think more venues would jump at a band saying "we wanna play a gig - just need a space.  it's for a birthday and we have a good crowd to join.  don't even have to pay us."
[14:27:45] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window.
[14:32:03] <Uhkis> lol
[14:51:39] <bjsnider> if i wanted to reset specific inputs to zilch, i guess i could wrap them in a div, and do ('#container-0').find('input').reset(); right?
[14:58:38] <MassDebates> taplar:  Can I get a link to the cloth demo that peformed badly on codepen?
[15:37:35] <taplar> what?
[15:37:53] <MassDebates> You had a cloth demo in codepen and jsfiddle
[15:37:58] <MassDebates> It worked well in fiddle but not codepen
[15:38:07] <MassDebates> may I see the codepen?
[15:38:11] <taplar> dunno what you are talking about man
[15:39:04] <MassDebates> You had a demo in jsfiddle that performed really well comparative to codepen. Framerates dropped significantly. It was a 3D banner cloth that could be maniupulated via mouse.
[15:39:15] <MassDebates> You told me about how you contacted codepen because of the difference in performance
[15:39:39] <MassDebates> This was a result after our discourse on codepen vs jsfiddle in usage for demos and whatnot.
[15:39:55] <MassDebates> If I recall correctly, it was at the same time you've shown me hidden world
[15:52:01] <MagnusVortex> MassDebates: was it discussed in this channel? if so, about on what date?
[15:53:22] <MassDebates> I'm trying to figure that out
[15:53:42] <MassDebates> taplar:  do you not recall any of this?
[15:55:04] <taplar> i've never done any of that
[15:57:45] <bjsnider> he's gaslighting you
[15:58:07] <MassDebates> No need, we know he's crazy already. Why else would he be here helping people
[15:58:11] <MassDebates> :P
[16:05:27] <m9l> Hey, I'm reading the content from a html into a variable with .get() the get method. When I do typeof on the variable it says "string". Does anyone know how to convert it to a html type, so that I can do getElementById on it to get a div? ;)
[16:06:32] <m9l> It looks like this now. https://pastebin.com/4HNXC2Vs
[16:06:38] <MassDebates> If I want to search the logs, how do I do that?
[16:06:51] <MassDebates> Indexes are blocked and clicking individual links seems a bit ridiculous
[16:07:19] <MassDebates> For some reason taplar hasn't responded since. It's possible that i have the wrong guy, but I was only talking to two people at the time, I think. taplar and robertmaxrees
[16:07:35] <MassDebates> I was impressed with the demo, it's not like this is a witch hunt or anything
[16:09:59] <AwkwardCough> if you remember the date and time you can check the logs
[16:11:12] <Es0teric|Work> when i have something on a click handler, how do i reference the context in jquery?
[16:11:31] <Es0teric|Work> for instance, if i am in a click event, would i be able to do $(this).find('fav')
[16:11:32] <Es0teric|Work> for instance
[16:12:12] <taplar> 'this' in the event handler should be the bound element that is processing the event
[16:53:19] <vacho> https://paste.ofcode.org/VJvqYaRC5S2P2kt82Tvhf6
[16:53:23] <vacho> is this not the right use of toggle?
[16:53:55] <robertmaxrees> this.value == 1 ?
[16:54:19] <robertmaxrees> you're calling it with .toggle(true, function)
[16:54:25] <robertmaxrees> or .toggle(false, function)
[16:54:46] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to use a callback with the true/false option?
[16:55:53] <vacho> yes, if it's true, I want something to happen in my callback function (I want to clear out the form elements)
[16:56:05] <robertmaxrees> i wanna say you can't do that.
[16:56:09] <robertmaxrees> the docs make it seem that way.
[16:59:19] <vacho> $('.panel-manufacturer-container').toggle( this.value == 1);
[16:59:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:59:29] <vacho> according to the docs, that is not possible either ;P
[16:59:37] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[16:59:40] <vacho> it is?
[16:59:47] <robertmaxrees> this.value == 1 gives you a boolean.
[17:00:06] <vacho> robertmaxrees: it takes a parameter for duration..? no?
[17:00:14] <robertmaxrees> read lower down.
[17:00:18] <robertmaxrees> the last signature listed.
[17:00:34] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/#toggle-display
[17:00:54] <vacho> yes true..found it now
[17:01:04] <vacho> what if I use the "complete" method?
[17:01:20] <robertmaxrees> just pass the options object.  should give you everything yoiu need.
[17:05:40] <vacho> robertmaxrees: it did, thank you!
[17:05:56] <robertmaxrees> rad
[17:14:45] <damiano> hello
[17:14:50] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[17:15:05] <damiano> is it possible to get the absolute url from a relative href ?
[17:15:09] <damiano> hi robertmaxrees
[17:15:23] <robertmaxrees> have an example of what you're working with?
[17:16:33] <damiano> robertmaxrees, i am getting all the link inside a webpage and i would like to same them into an array
[17:16:40] <damiano> the problem is that something the links are relative
[17:16:42] <robertmaxrees> and then do what?
[17:16:44] <damiano> and sometimes absolute
[17:17:01] <robertmaxrees> ah, and you want to normalize them?
[17:17:07] <damiano> at the moment nothing i am getting all the links... but i do not know how to create the absolute form
[17:17:08] <damiano> yes
[17:17:21] <robertmaxrees> what will you eventually be doing with them?
[17:17:23] <damiano> at the moment i do $('a').each(function(i,el) { test[i] = $(el).prop('href'); });
[17:17:48] <damiano> showing them on the page
[17:17:51] <damiano> all the url
[17:17:57] <damiano> a <li> with all the links
[17:18:10] <damiano> * <ul>
[17:19:19] <robertmaxrees> so first off, you should be using .map() for this - var myArrayOfLinks = $('a').map(function(i, el) { return el.href; });
[17:19:25] <robertmaxrees> secondly, that may solve the issue for you.
[17:19:56] <damiano> robertmaxrees, does it transform to absolute form ?
[17:20:03] <robertmaxrees> it should.
[17:20:09] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot.
[17:23:08] <damiano> robertmaxrees, $(el).attr('href')
[17:23:10] <damiano> this works
[17:23:13] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[17:23:14] <damiano> el.href retunrs nothing
[17:23:21] <damiano> but it is relative
[17:23:26] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[17:23:33] <robertmaxrees> "returns nothing but is relative"?
[17:29:15] <damiano> nono robertmaxrees
[17:29:19] <damiano> el.href nothing
[17:29:26] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:29:28] <damiano> the code is wrote returns the links but relative
[17:29:38] <damiano> $(el).attr('href')
[17:29:47] <damiano> this works but returns relative urls
[17:29:57] <robertmaxrees> var myArrayOfLinks = $('a').map(function(i, el) { return el.href; });
[17:30:04] <robertmaxrees> so when you check myArrayOfLinks, you get nothing?
[17:30:17] <robertmaxrees> oh that sould be myArrayOfLinks = $('a').map(function(i, el) { return el.href; }).get();
[17:30:20] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[17:31:53] <damiano> robertmaxrees,
[17:31:54] <damiano>             var allLinks = $('a').map(function(i, el) { return el.href; }).get();
[17:31:54] <damiano>             console.log(allLinks);
[17:32:01] <damiano> returns []
[17:32:16] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('a').length);
[17:32:19] <robertmaxrees> what does that give you?
[17:32:56] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2a266bfw/
[17:33:36] <damiano> robertmaxrees, 120
[17:33:36] <damiano> []
[17:33:41] <damiano> that's the output
[17:34:02] <damiano> 120 links
[17:34:13] <robertmaxrees> you're not leaving the js as one line, right?
[17:38:05] <vacho> this works great: https://paste.ofcode.org/32xQ5DgEzjkUL9LUq2wejLf ... but my default the elements I want to hide is not hidden.. how can I make jquery run this function on load to hide the elements I am hiding in line 7 and 8?
[17:38:38] <robertmaxrees> vacho easy - pull the function out and define it separately, then immediately call it and use that reference to bind it instead.
[17:39:44] <vacho> robertmaxrees: can't I do this? $('select[name=inverter_manufacturer_publicly_traded]').change();
[17:39:52] <vacho> wouldn't that make it run that function?
[17:40:00] <robertmaxrees> you could, but that's a bad way to do it.
[17:40:12] <vacho> robertmaxrees: may I ask why
[17:40:17] <vacho> robertmaxrees: I don't question it, just want to learn
[17:40:32] <robertmaxrees> so what about my suggestion doesn't make sense?
[17:44:16] <damiano> robertmaxrees, ? this is my code https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cf98b6af02de84379e343b36e8dea3a6
[17:44:35] <robertmaxrees> damiano that's why - you need to properly format that .map()
[17:44:42] <robertmaxrees> check out the fiddle i shared for more.
[17:47:44] <damiano> robertmaxrees, oh really the format matters?
[17:47:45] <damiano> eheh
[17:47:57] <damiano> why?
[17:48:49] <robertmaxrees> semicolons, yo.
[17:48:54] <robertmaxrees> it works tho.
[17:48:57] <robertmaxrees> and that's what matters.
[17:49:00] <robertmaxrees> also far more readable.
[17:49:08] <damiano> ok
[17:50:45] <damiano> robertmaxrees, how can i get the links only?
[17:50:51] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:50:52] <damiano> at the moment i jsee jquery array as output
[17:50:58] <damiano> $.makeArray
[17:50:59] <damiano> ?
[17:51:26] <robertmaxrees> allLinks is an array.
[17:51:31] <robertmaxrees> a non-jquery object.
[17:51:35] <robertmaxrees> that's why you have that .get() there.
[17:52:43] <damiano> hmmm
[17:52:47] <damiano> i see this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/79cf1eb8ed5da6e2fcf852d438fbd8f2
[17:53:02] <damiano> for each element of the array
[17:53:16] <robertmaxrees> show the final code you're using?
[17:53:25] <damiano> wait wait....
[17:53:28] <damiano> wrong code maybe
[17:53:29] <damiano> :D
[17:55:31] <damiano> robertmaxrees, nothing your code does not work....maybe because i am using it on the server side via cheerio.js
[17:55:42] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:55:54] <damiano> +node.js
[17:56:05] <bjsnider> is there any way to check for existing event handlers?
[17:56:14] <WebDevB> Can anyone help with this please.
[17:58:17] <WebDevB> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43091824/abide-foundation-on-valid-form
[17:58:58] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider ish, but it's kind of a pain.
[17:58:59] <robertmaxrees> why?
[17:59:32] <bjsnider> wondering if i'm adding handlers to cloned objects, and then i remove the object, is the handler also gone?
[18:00:14] <bjsnider> or is it in some spiritual sense floating around there
[18:01:20] <taplar> how are you removing the object?
[18:01:43] <bjsnider> .remove
[18:01:55] <taplar> that should do clean up afaik
[18:02:09] <taplar> but also, are you saying you are creating handlers over and over and over?
[18:03:05] <bjsnider> one is created based on a click
[18:03:09] <bjsnider> and so on
[18:03:48] <taplar> but are you creating the handler again and again?
[18:03:54] <taplar> or are you reusing one?
[18:04:37] <bjsnider> it's a new handler each time
[18:04:56] <taplar> you should store the handler and reuse it then
[18:09:01] <bjsnider> not quite sure what that means
[18:10:01] <taplar> if the handler is the exact same every time, meaning it's not copying in some outer scoped variables into it when it is created, there is no point creating it multiple times and having the same method being in memory multiple times
[18:10:09] <taplar> you're just bloating your ram usage at that point
[18:11:07] <bjsnider> it is a function being filled out by variables
[18:11:07] <robertmaxrees> is it a handler or is it a jqui method?
[18:11:23] <bjsnider> i misunderstood what you were asking
[18:11:50] <taplar> k
[18:12:36] <bjsnider> it's exactly the same thing but attached using matching ids, which are filled using vars, but i just would like to make sure the things are being destroyed by .remove
[18:13:04] <bjsnider> what would be the consequence of a detached handler sitting there?
[18:13:12] <bjsnider> i assume detached is the right term
[18:13:46] <taplar> afaik remove() should go through all the elements it is destroying and clean up any internal caches for them it has, which includes bindings
[18:13:55] <bjsnider> cool
[18:13:56] <taplar> as opposed to detach() which would not do any cleanup
[18:14:10] <bjsnider> i think i read that, now that you mention it
[18:14:25] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: handler
[18:15:59] <taplar> https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=git&fn=_remove
[18:16:31] <taplar> it uses cleanData()
[18:16:37] <taplar> you can click that guy to see what he does if you care to
[18:17:20] <bjsnider> uses a for loop
[18:17:40] <bjsnider> i thought they were only teaching tools
[18:17:49] <taplar> why not?
[18:20:01] <taplar> and actually there is probably a reason for that
[18:20:18] <taplar> most iterators will die if you destroy what they are iterating over
[18:20:54] <taplar> destroying things so the set number changes with an iterator, big no no
[18:21:08] <bjsnider> that loop stops when null is encountered too
[18:21:33] <taplar> sure
[18:23:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd wager at least part of the reason jquery uses a for loop here has something to do with the special case it has around null and due to the browsers they were at least trying to support pre 3.x
[18:26:14] <taplar> if only there was a room were such questions could be posed
[18:26:20] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[18:26:23] <taplar> :D
[18:26:28] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it's pretty obvious to me buuuut.... (shrug)
[18:28:44] <WebDevB> can anyone hlep with this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43091824/abide-foundation-on-valid-form
[18:28:51] <robertmaxrees> WebDevB what's your question?
[18:29:04] <robertmaxrees> ah, see it now.
[18:29:13] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: it's driving me crazy
[18:29:45] <robertmaxrees> does unblockUI get run?
[18:30:01] <robertmaxrees> like, if you stick a console.log() right before it does that get it?
[18:30:49] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: let me check
[18:30:51] <robertmaxrees> because right now,your code says to block the UI and then submit pretty much immediately.
[18:30:59] <robertmaxrees> though your code doesn't make sense.
[18:31:05] <robertmaxrees> you have a return before the submit()
[18:31:11] <robertmaxrees> which means the submit never gets hit.
[18:31:28] <WebDevB> I want the form to submit once the animation block ui has completed
[18:31:45] <robertmaxrees> so then stick your submit call in that setTimeout
[18:32:03] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: how do you mean.
[18:32:20] <robertmaxrees> right now that code runs as soon as the setTimeout starts.
[18:32:22] <robertmaxrees> not when it ends.
[18:33:19] <robertmaxrees> http://malsup.com/jquery/block/#options looks like you want the onUnBlock option hgere
[18:33:22] <robertmaxrees> *here
[18:34:06] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: ok, 1 sec.
[18:34:49] <taplar> seems like the case that the invalid does not stop the submit, even if it returns false?
[18:35:12] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: taplar: so like this: https://codeshare.io/axLnqP
[18:35:13] <robertmaxrees> the return false; in there is odd.
[18:35:27] <taplar> i mean, that could cancel the invalid event, not the submit event for all we know
[18:35:30] <robertmaxrees> that's only part of the code WebDevB
[18:35:37] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[18:35:45] <robertmaxrees> except that won't wait for unblockUI to finish either.
[18:35:49] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs i linked
[18:36:13] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: I can't see anything in those docs really.
[18:36:21] <robertmaxrees> really?
[18:36:47] <WebDevB> sorry, not that I could see robertmaxrees
[18:37:00] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/PnUkA8B.png
[18:37:02] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:37:40] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: but the thing is the blockui only happens for a second and then the form gets submitted.
[18:37:50] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't matter?
[18:37:51] <WebDevB> I want it to wait 17000 then submit the form.
[18:37:56] <robertmaxrees> you want to wait for unblockUI to finish.
[18:38:03] <robertmaxrees> unless you don't, in which case what you had was fine.
[18:38:30] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: that's what I mean... blockui doesn't really start
[18:38:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:38:39] <robertmaxrees> "does't really start"?
[18:38:44] <WebDevB> https://www.luckyloans.co.uk/personal-loan-application-form-2/
[18:38:54] <WebDevB> fill that in with dummy data and you'll see what I mean.
[18:39:05] <robertmaxrees> that's... a big test case O.o
[18:39:31] <robertmaxrees> either way - so if you don't care about when unblockUI finishes, then just stick your code after the call.
[18:39:33] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[18:49:04] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: that's the thing, blockui seems to load for a second and then the form get's submitted.
[18:49:16] <WebDevB> I want it to complete the blockui and then submit the form.
[18:49:23] <robertmaxrees> then do that.
[18:49:27] <robertmaxrees> using the onUnblock option
[18:50:38] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: let's give it ago.
[18:56:51] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: doesn't seem to have worked... I might have done it wrong.
[18:57:26] <robertmaxrees> she the code.
[18:57:28] <robertmaxrees> *show
[18:58:58] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: https://codeshare.io/aldJbm
[18:59:21] <WebDevB> Just wanted to see if it actually did anything.
[18:59:30] <gambl0re> hey robert, hows going?
[18:59:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use that WebDevB
[18:59:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to hand it a function.
[18:59:50] <robertmaxrees> right now you're assigning the return of alert('test');
[19:00:00] <robertmaxrees> try function() { console.log('foo') } there instead.
[19:00:47] <Al_nz1> morning peeps
[19:01:21] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: ok done: https://codeshare.io/aldJbm
[19:01:28] <WebDevB> it seems to wait a couple more seconds now.
[19:01:49] <robertmaxrees> and...?
[19:01:53] <robertmaxrees> did you see the console log?
[19:01:57] <Al_nz1> hey Robdgreat
[19:01:58] <WebDevB> no
[19:02:00] <Al_nz1> hey robertmaxrees
[19:02:03] <WebDevB> the pay redirects
[19:02:06] <WebDevB> *page
[19:02:23] <robertmaxrees> you're not stopping it from doing that.
[19:02:29] <robertmaxrees> return false; in that on submit handler.
[19:03:01] <WebDevB> ok
[19:03:04] <WebDevB> let me test again
[19:04:01] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: you ever used thymeleaf ?
[19:05:13] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: ok, it now shows the animation but the form doesn't actually submit and there isn't anything in the console.
[19:05:54] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 nope.
[19:06:18] <robertmaxrees> WebDevB it won't submit because you stop it from doing so always.  but you're not seeing the console.log()? what if you put an alert there instead?
[19:08:44] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: this now works and stamps foo in the console
[19:08:45] <WebDevB> https://codeshare.io/aldJbm
[19:08:51] <WebDevB> But now we need to submit the form.
[19:08:52] <WebDevB> haha
[19:09:00] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: thanks for your help on this.
[19:10:03] <robertmaxrees> WebDevB yeah, you can call submit against the raw domn node instead.
[19:10:21] <Al_nz1> k
[19:10:29] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: that went over my head.
[19:10:32] <WebDevB> 1 sec
[19:10:39] <robertmaxrees> so instead of $('form').submit()
[19:10:52] <robertmaxrees> you use submit() against the raw dom node.
[19:11:15] <WebDevB> raw dom node being?
[19:12:35] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/064bc6b650fd
[19:12:37] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[19:14:47] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: you my friend are awesome!!
[19:14:58] <WebDevB> If you're every in Manchester, UK - DRINKS ARE ON ME.
[19:15:04] <WebDevB> *ever
[19:21:28] <robertmaxrees> hah.  definitely!
[19:31:32] <maxjq> Hey guys, I am trying to send serialized base64 data through an ajax call, but it seems to be changing the data over the call (logged before and after and they are different format wise)
[19:46:16] <shoky> maxjq: show your code.. elaborate
[19:56:08] <vacho> this function works as expected, but I want to hide the elements on line 7,8 on load ... what is a good way to achieve that? https://paste.ofcode.org/qBthUgrJwvjfnnVagNDE5K
[19:56:50] <vacho> I also wonder when running $('select[name=inverter_manufacturer_publicly_traded]').change(); it shows the elements, even though line 3 is false
[19:56:51] <zampa> ugh i hate trying to set up a webserver on windows >.<
[19:56:59] <zampa> i think this progrom is the worst thing i ever saw..
[19:59:05] <maxjq> http://puu.sh/v2Ogb/da8e017978.png
[19:59:13] <maxjq> Thats the jquery code
[19:59:34] <maxjq> http://puu.sh/v2Ohp/fcca121a2f.png
[19:59:38] <maxjq> Thats the backend code
[20:01:02] <maxjq> Here's the first bit of the base64 before hand
[20:01:03] <maxjq> http://puu.sh/v2OlS/18e0504f0e.png
[20:01:21] <maxjq> And afterwards its like this
[20:01:21] <maxjq> http://puu.sh/v2One/0d832e73c0.png
[20:02:46] <vacho> maxjq: paste your code and share the link
[20:11:40] <shoky> maxjq: that's the same data in before and after.. but that's not just base64 encoding, it's a base64 data URI format
[20:14:01] <shoky> maxjq: so it's not enough just to base64 decode it in your backend.. you'd need to remove the "data:image/png;base64," prefix i guess
[23:33:08] <WhirledPress> How could I find all classes and ids in an html page?
[23:33:59] <plus65Naomi> WhirledPress, see your source code?
[23:34:06] <WhirledPress> lol, thanks.
[23:34:07] <plus65Naomi> Ctrl+U
[23:34:25] <plus65Naomi> i dunno
[23:34:26] <plus65Naomi> lol
[23:34:32] <WhirledPress> I'm looking for the list of required css definitions for validation
[23:34:55] <plus65Naomi> then.. see .css
[23:51:35] <WhirledPress> plus65Naomi, got it  it was easier than I thought: https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/n316njaw/1/
[23:53:51] <plus65Naomi> lol
