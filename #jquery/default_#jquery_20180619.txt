[08:22:11] <CorsairX> Hi all
[08:22:30] <CorsairX> I have question - I have a table that I want to be able to add a row too
[08:22:47] <CorsairX> I've done this by having a template row, hidden, that I can append
[08:23:20] <CorsairX> At the end of the row is a button that, in theory, I'd like to add the next row
[08:23:47] <CorsairX> However, cloning the row and adding it does not add the event
[08:24:11] <CorsairX> I'm afraid I'm a bit a new to JQuery and would like to know if anyone can point me in the right direction?
[08:24:13] <localh0st> CorsairX: what's the event definition?
[08:25:06] <CorsairX> Easier to paste the code?
[08:25:54] <localh0st> pastebin.com
[08:26:11] <preference> jsfiddle.net
[08:26:13] <preference> ^^^
[08:27:08] <preference> $(".button").click(function(){; $(".table").addrow(); });
[08:27:25] <localh0st> CorsairX: I guess you just should use .on() function on those elements instead of using something like .click()
[08:27:45] <CorsairX> Sorry, just creating the fiddle
[08:31:44] <CorsairX> http://jsfiddle.net/3dash82o/
[08:32:34] <CorsairX> http://jsfiddle.net/3dash82o/3/
[08:33:40] <preference> add jquery to the library
[08:34:03] <preference> in the lower left quarter, above your javascript/jquery code, change the framework to jquery 2.whatever
[08:34:18] <preference> 2.2.4 will do
[08:34:51] <preference> you don't need to put your .click() inside a function
[08:34:57] <preference> http://jsfiddle.net/3dash82o/7/
[08:36:03] <CorsairX> Thanks - will give that a shot
[08:39:28] <CorsairX> Ok, I'm getting the same behaviour, new row created but the new button doesn't work
[08:39:38] <CorsairX> I might not have properly understand what you meant?
[08:40:51] <shyos> hey guys, I've got a small problem with this
[08:40:52] <shyos> http://jsfiddle.net/m79utpgb/22/
[08:41:08] <shyos> hover on static-image-title triggers the border to appear
[08:41:27] <shyos> how to trigger it with mouseenter in jquery?
[08:41:43] <preference> CorsairX: you're cloning a table row, removing the id, showing the row, and adding to the parent of the row
[08:42:37] <preference> i'm also trying to figure out why the second click is not working
[08:42:48] <CorsairX> Yes
[08:42:54] <shyos> I need it to appear when I hover over image aswell as over the title but Im struggling for way too long with this
[08:43:14] <CorsairX> Thanks
[08:44:24] <preference> shyos: so when you hover over the image, smooth-border is added to the title?
[08:44:30] <preference> or when you hover over the image, smooth-border is added to the image?
[08:45:11] <shyos> smooth-border is added to the title
[08:46:13] <CorsairX> I should add that in my own code I have the function in a script file and not in the header of the html file
[08:58:16] <preference> shyos: have you got static-image??
[08:59:35] <shyos> preference: yeh, its the wrapper for the whole block
[08:59:56] <shyos> could change it to $('.static-image > img > a') aswell
[09:00:05] <shyos> a > img *
[09:00:19] <shyos> the problem is with :hover:after
[09:00:37] <shyos> as you can't really access pseudo elements with jQ I believe
[09:01:14] <preference> ya
[09:01:16] <preference> it's weird
[09:02:20] <shyos> well, it works fine when you hover over .static-image-title but how to trigger :hover:after using jQ? thats the question :D
[09:04:15] <shyos> I guess I'll just skip this :hover:after thing by changing the effect lol
[09:04:37] <shyos> I'll make this border-bottom fadeIn or something ffs
[09:04:57] <preference> shyos: change the css property directly? http://api.jquery.com/css/
[09:05:01] <preference> not sure if this will work, though
[09:05:29] <shyos> ye,h that's what I'll do
[09:05:40] <shyos> instead of expanding the border from the middle I'll just change it's color gradually
[09:05:45] <shyos> thanks man, appreciate your help
[09:05:55] <preference> lol, np
[09:06:48] <preference> CorsairX: the button is not the same button
[09:07:07] <preference> if you add console.log("button clicked") to your code for the button, then you will only get one log no matter how many times you click it
[09:07:45] <CorsairX> Would it be easier to clone the row where the button exists and clean the other input's in the row?
[09:08:03] <preference> i do not know the reason for this, because as far as i see, you are adding the button in the new row
[09:08:07] <preference> potentially
[09:08:19] <CorsairX> There are two buttons
[09:08:27] <CorsairX> One in the initial, visible row
[09:08:30] <CorsairX> And another in the hidden row
[09:08:41] <CorsairX> The hidden row gets cloned and made visible
[09:09:03] <CorsairX> Then I remove the button that is visible on load
[09:10:12] <preference> Cork: any ideas?
[09:10:32] <Cork> hmm?
[09:11:14] <preference> http://jsfiddle.net/3dash82o/11
[09:11:39] <preference> second time you click the button, it doesn't work
[09:11:42] <Cork> you want delegate
[09:12:30] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/3dash82o/14/
[09:12:58] <Cork> also i would prob hide the add-row button with css
[09:13:23] <CorsairX> That's perfect - thank you both
[09:13:29] <CorsairX> Cork: why hide?
[09:14:19] <Cork> just cleaner
[09:16:56] <CorsairX> Ok
[09:17:20] <CorsairX> preference, thanks
[09:17:30] <CorsairX> Cork, thanks
[09:20:00] <Cork> something like http://jsfiddle.net/3dash82o/22/
[09:20:27] <Cork> opps missed that there was a lot of headers in there too http://jsfiddle.net/3dash82o/23/
[09:20:56] * Cork gets back to work
[10:32:26] <asdfqwerqwer> Is there any way to select by partial attribute name?
[10:32:36] <asdfqwerqwer> $("div[*something]")
[10:49:15] <Cork> asdfqwerqwer: no, and you don't want to select by attribute if you can avoid it
[10:50:59] <asdfqwerqwer> Oh?
[10:51:14] <asdfqwerqwer> Is it particularly inefficient?
[10:51:17] <Cork> the browser has to loop every element and check the attribute
[10:51:34] <asdfqwerqwer> How is that different from class?
[10:51:46] <Cork> browsers has hash tables for ids and classes
[10:51:53] <asdfqwerqwer> Ah.
[10:51:54] <Cork> so they just check in the table for the elements
[10:52:20] <asdfqwerqwer> Thanks for the help.
[10:52:38] <Cork> performance cost is ids/class > element name > attribute/value >>>>>>>>>>> element content
[10:53:43] <asdfqwerqwer> I just had a weird situation where I wanted to store values in attributes.
[10:53:58] <Cork> just make sure you use data- prefixed attributes
[10:53:59] <asdfqwerqwer> But I guess I will just assign a queriable name in the class.
[10:54:22] <asdfqwerqwer> Need to look that up. Not sure why you are saying that.
[10:54:39] <Cork> cause data- prefixed attributes are reserved for website developers
[10:54:59] <Cork> if you don't data- prefix them and it isn't standard attribute names they are invalid
[10:55:44] <asdfqwerqwer> hmm
[10:55:46] <asdfqwerqwer> Invalid?
[10:56:01] <Cork> as if you run the page through an html validator it will complain
[10:56:37] <Cork> and it might have unintended consequences in future browsers when they add new attributes
[10:57:13] <Cork> for example 4 years ago they added a new attribute to <a> tags (download) and some sites that used that on some of there links broke
[10:57:32] <Cork> if they had used data-download it wouldn't
[10:57:36] <asdfqwerqwer> lol
[10:58:16] <Cork> it is also to lessen the pain for developing the html standard
[10:59:55] <asdfqwerqwer> Put "data-" and classes on everything. #verbosity
[11:00:08] <Cork> classes on everything isn't needed
[11:00:27] <Cork> but if you plan to select on it more then a rarely of times you want a class or id for performance
[11:00:48] <Cork> and don't expect partial attribute names to be a thing
[11:02:25] <Cork> and also not everything, just none standard things
[11:07:10] <asdfqwerqwer> Just everything with data attached to it.
[11:07:19] <asdfqwerqwer> #everything
[11:24:18] <asdfqwerqwer> would decorators not work well on functions containing ajax?
[17:57:49] <gambl0re> hello?
[17:58:44] <robertmaxrees> over 300 people here :)
[18:00:05] <gambl0re> im trying to do a scroll to top animation once the user reaches the bottom of the page but it aint working out
[18:02:03] <Johne> where would I throw an exception (if) on this fiddle so that I can do a different behavior based on $domain value https://jsfiddle.net/d74xv1ew/
[18:29:06] <robertmaxrees> Johne what do you mean?
[18:29:49] <robertmaxrees> like, if ($domain.val() === 'foo') { /* do this */ } else { /* do this instead */ };
[18:29:50] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:30:15] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re a test case would be super helpful :)
[18:53:45] <Johne> this is what I have robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/tk1qawsg/2/
[18:54:09] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:54:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/tk1qawsg/3/
[18:54:30] <robertmaxrees> i think you mean this.
[18:54:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:54:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/tk1qawsg/4/ for valid code.
[19:13:25] <robertmaxrees> Johne that answer your question?
[20:19:55] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/hxocesgy/1/
[20:24:34] <khobo> can anyone tell me why
[20:24:39] <khobo> the drop down in mobile response
[20:24:44] <khobo> diseapears when i scroll?
[23:02:42] <Johne> So I got the if statement to work exactly how I wanted, now I just need to disable checkbox based on same value https://jsfiddle.net/tk1qawsg/4/ lines 13-18 is my attempt that breaks it all :D
[23:06:04] <pavonia> What are you trying to achieve?
[23:07:21] <Johne> to disable whatever checkbox with the same value as the dropdown
[23:07:39] <Johne> along with ifs
[23:13:47] <Johne> here's a working example without ifs https://jsfiddle.net/d74xv1ew/
[23:14:05] <Johne> so really combining the two
[23:16:13] <Johne> not sure where I've gone wrong
[23:25:07] <pavonia> Johne: In the first one you disable the checkbox in both branches
[23:25:41] <Johne> branches?
[23:29:04] <pavonia> In the if's then and else parts I mean
[23:30:19] <Johne> ah ok, I follow now
[23:33:19] <Johne> they're both disabled, but checked is the only difference
[23:34:21] <Johne> and if dropdown value === checkbox value, it should be dusabled snd unchecked just like tge 2nd fiddle
[23:37:00] <pavonia> If they are not the same you want to undo the disabling
[23:38:13] <Johne> correct
[23:39:12] <Johne> and if any other value is chosen, abc.com gets disabled and checked
[23:51:04] <Johne> does that make sense?
[23:53:15] <pavonia> Is should get enabled and unchecked then, no?
[23:54:36] <Johne> nah, locking in the value
[23:58:08] <Johne> if !=abc.com make abc.com checked/disabled, whatever domain value is selected, the corrisponding checkbox is unchecked snd disabled
