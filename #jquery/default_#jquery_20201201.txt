[00:49:25] <TheDabboness> can anyone help?https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65085065/how-do-i-include-jquery-ui-in-my-ui-html-for-a-chrome-extension-im-building
[00:52:00] <robertmaxrees> are you getting any errors or anything?
[00:55:43] <robertmaxrees> TheDabboness i would start by making sure jquery is loading on is own, and then check to make sure that it's loading before jqui.  i'd head over to a chrome extension channel for that topic tho.
[00:56:18] <TheDabboness> robertmaxrees: no errors. can you recommend a chrome extension channel?
[00:56:41] <robertmaxrees> google around and see what you find :)
[01:36:44] <Cork> most google related commynities usually hang hang around in google forums, so i suspect you'll find it there
[07:05:13] <guest1119> How should I tackle this? https://jsfiddle.net/q7n580d6/1/ I wish to show a hover effect after 1s, but since the divs are next to eachother the mouseleave function is never called if I drag the mouse over all divs left to right.
[07:05:42] <guest1119> So dragging the mouse horizontally will create 4 timers, where only the last one is terminated on mouselave
[07:06:18] <Cork> put the leave check on the plainbody-hover instead of on body
[07:06:50] <guest1119> The reason I have the body is because the plainbody-hover are created dynamically
[07:07:37] <Cork> you bind the event handler on it sure, but mouseleave won't ever trigger on body as everything is a child of it
[07:07:53] <Cork> so delegate it from the plainbody-hover just like you do for enter
[07:08:19] <guest1119> Yeah, ok. I got it
[08:30:24] <irthewinner> guys, small question:
[08:31:27] <irthewinner> I have a form with submit button and I want to: "when I click the submit button, it will disable it temporary" but it will get it back active after user closes the bootstrap.alert (or when it's closed after 2 sec)
[08:32:18] <irthewinner> the bootstrap alert show some info (with an option to manually close the alert "X") or it will fadeout after some seconds
[08:32:45] <irthewinner> I want the button to be active only after the alert is hidden, but cant find such event in jquery to : on.('hidden') or something
[08:33:24] <irthewinner> like $"#myalert".on('invisible', function(){})
[08:35:25] <irthewinner> in short: im looking for a way to jQuery event to trigger action when a div is made invisible/visible
[08:50:41] <Robdgreat> irthewinner: isn't there a function that toggles the visibility? hook it into that
[08:50:58] <irthewinner> hmm i didnt see any but let me check again sec
[08:51:01] <Robdgreat> that is, isn't the visibility being toggled by some other function
[08:51:08] <Robdgreat> what is actually doing the toggling?
[08:53:51] <irthewinner> ok when i click submit button: it shows an "bootstrap"-alert that fadeouts after some seconds
[08:54:16] <irthewinner> but i want the submit button to be "enabled" again after the fadeout of alert
[09:00:44] <Cork> irthewinner: you want to listen for the events from the alert https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/#events
[09:03:03] <irthewinner> oh thanks mate :) I will read about it now
[09:03:30] <guest1119> I am returning an e-mail from the database in the format: Jane Miller <jane.miller@cool.com>. In my request response the < > are replaced by for an example \u003C, when I look in my html code it seems the e-mail is created as a html tag thus not displayed. I tried different replace methods but with no luck. Suggestions?
[09:04:32] <Cork> guest1119: you really REALLY R-E-E-E-A-L-Y don't want to parse random emails as html
[09:04:46] <Cork> you will expose your self to xss so fast your head will spin
[09:05:24] <guest1119> Cork: sure, how should I then do it? Simply remove the < >  and go for Jane Miller jane.miller@cool.com, or maybe I should just select the content between the < > chars
[09:05:34] <Cork> the only safe way to do it is $('#target').append($('<pre>', text: content));
[09:05:57] <Cork> basically create a dom element and add the content from the database as text
[09:06:15] <Cork> pre is recommended to keep the format, but isn't needed
[09:07:26] <Cork> but you don't even want to do $(elm).html(rawString)
[09:07:35] <Cork> cause that will be masively unsafe
[09:07:46] <Cork> even==ever
[09:08:16] <guest1119> I will just extract the content between < > in my query, since that is what is relevant
[09:08:40] <Cork> guest1119: if you don't plan to use anything at all except that sure
[09:09:15] <Cork> guest1119: but note email can have contents inside <> so still make sure to handle it as text not html
[09:09:28] <Cork> ... comments! not contents -_-'
[09:09:53] <Cork> guest1119: basically everything in raw email is exctreamly unsafe to be very careful
[09:10:35] <Cork> for example if you have an element you want to show the email address in, make sure to do $('#target').text(emailAddress)
[09:10:49] <Cork> and not add it as part of an html string or similar
[09:11:28] <Cork> if you absolutely have to have it as html do $('<span>').text(emailAddress).html() to escape everything in it
[09:38:15] <guest1119> Thanks Cork, I got it.
