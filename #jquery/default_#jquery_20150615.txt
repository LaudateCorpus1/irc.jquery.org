[00:10:22] <DaferX> hi
[00:10:28] <DaferX> i have a question
[00:11:03] <DaferX> is it posible or is it existing that, jquery can detect or fetch the email logged in in the mobile?
[00:11:46] <Cork> DaferX: what?
[00:12:03] <Cork> jquery is for modifying the dom
[00:12:10] <Cork> it can't do anything normal js can't do
[00:15:43] <DaferX> sorry im new on jquery ...is there any js/ jquery or any js script that can check the any mobile information?
[00:16:00] <Woet> what are you trying to do?
[00:17:11] <DaferX> actually, im trying to make a something like 'email subscription' pop out in a mobile phone, if first time pop out will show up, then if 2nd time the email is checked to be already subscribe it wont show.
[00:17:31] <DaferX> using html only
[00:18:20] <DaferX> i have php to check the database for the emails tho
[00:18:24] <Woet> so use something like cookies
[00:19:26] <Cork> DaferX: no, untrusted code can't access random settings in the phone
[00:19:34] <Woet> Cork: but why?!
[00:19:52] <DaferX> Cork: well, i was thinking about it also.
[00:20:07] <rominronin> hi, does anyone have any experience with hyphenator.js?
[00:20:13] <Cork> DaferX: is the visitor logged in to the site?
[00:20:42] <DaferX> Cork: jquery can do the 'login using fb'?
[00:21:15] <Cork> DaferX: heh.. ya, sure if you can get visitors to accept to give you access to there fb profile
[00:21:25] <Cork> you can through the fb api access what email they have
[00:21:40] <Cork> but... i suspect most fb users would be very reluctant to give you full profile access
[00:21:50] <Cork> at least i would if i had an account
[00:22:04] <DaferX> my idea is, maybe jquery can do somethig like that in the mobile email
[00:22:09] <Cork> no
[00:22:25] <Cork> jquery is just a framework for making it easier to write dom modifications
[00:22:29] <DaferX> i see thank you. prolly need native andriod can do somethig like that
[00:22:53] <Cork> DaferX: or just rethink the solution
[00:23:05] <DaferX> can you help me? sorry
[00:23:11] <Cork> scrapping the users information is normally considered a poor idea
[00:23:31] <Cork> DaferX: well if you don't store a login for the user
[00:23:35] <Cork> you have noway to identify them
[00:23:51] <DaferX> yah
[00:24:17] <DaferX> thank you
[00:24:38] <Cork> sure you could store a session cookie
[00:24:47] <Cork> and use that as an identifyer
[00:25:18] <Cork> but it would mean you would reask for the email everytime the cookie gets reset
[00:25:19] <rominronin> Has anyone used hyphenator.js on any projects
[00:25:58] <Cork> rominronin: why would you need it?
[00:25:59] <DaferX> yah, thank you cork
[00:26:22] <Cork> browsers has built in support for hyphenation
[00:27:11] <rominronin> a good example is long titles in small containers on tablet sized screens -
[00:27:28] <Cork> rominronin: ever heard of css hyphens?
[00:27:32] <Cork> ?mdn hyphens
[00:27:40] <rominronin> basically too wide to assign width 100%
[00:27:43] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens
[00:30:26] <rominronin> the lack of chrome support is the main reason I think hyphenator was adopted.
[00:31:23] <rominronin> Cork: ty for the link!
[01:50:17] <hellyeah> hey
[01:50:24] <hellyeah> i cannot reac the css file of this
[01:50:31] <hellyeah> anyone knows how can i get the file
[01:50:32] <hellyeah> https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#animated
[01:51:02] <Cork> https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/dialog/animated.html
[01:51:40] <dANO> Hi, In a each, How can I called a function every 5 seconds ? I tried the setTimeout function but he seems doesn't worked.
[01:52:40] <dANO> my each loop is in the video.ontimeupdate function
[01:52:46] <Cork> dANO: you can't do things ever x in a loop
[01:52:57] <Cork> you have to trigger every 5 seconds and do things in a loop in there
[01:53:05] <Cork> (so the reverse)
[01:53:15] <dANO> Hum, ok
[01:53:44] <Cork> dANO: setTimeout triggers a callback async, while an each look is sync
[01:53:58] <Cork> and sync things can't wait for async actions
[01:55:14] <dANO> hum ok, I will check
[01:59:17] <rominronin> I just realised the issue I’m getting is because hyphenator.js works BETTER than hyphens, so to fix the issue I need to force hyphenator on across browsers
[01:59:20] <rominronin> :))))
[02:00:08] <Cork> rominronin: you most likely don't have the correct lang set on the text in that case
[02:01:01] <rominronin> I just checked. you’re right!
[02:05:31] <amtrivedi> hello all
[02:05:45] <amtrivedi> I am want to check if my checkbox is checked or not and do something if it is checked.
[02:05:46] <amtrivedi> http://dpaste.com/1EJV6JH#line-15
[02:05:46] <amtrivedi> ^Here is the code.
[02:05:46] <amtrivedi> But it gives Unexpected token .
[02:05:46] <amtrivedi> What is the problem?
[02:20:26] <hrusti> can I select elements with NOT and OR condition in jquery selector? e.g. $('div:not(div[data-sth="foo"] or div[data-sth="bar"])') ?
[02:28:53] <dANO> It's possible to find an element by css value. I would like find my element who got the style = "border: 1px red solid" ? I know my question is weird but I ask anyway :D
[02:37:09] <Cork> hrusti: or is comma
[02:37:23] <Cork> but you can't nest selectors inside :not
[02:37:26] <kokut> Hello, how can i select the element of the selection ?
[02:37:38] <kokut> sry, the second* element of the selection
[02:37:53] <Cork> dANO: no, use a class for the value
[02:38:01] <Cork> kokut: .eq
[02:38:09] <kokut> mkay
[02:38:33] <kokut> cant i just do like in js like [0-n] or something ?
[02:38:48] <Cork> that is what .eq does
[02:38:59] <Cork> except [] will give you the raw dom element
[02:39:12] <Cork> $().eq(0) === $($()[0])
[02:39:31] <kokut> mmh idk what that means lol i thought they were all raw
[02:39:58] <Cork> kokut: $()[0].each == unknown function each
[02:40:08] <Cork> kokut: $()[0].innerHTML == "html string"
[02:40:14] <parveen> how can i call function once return from previous function ?
[02:40:23] <kokut> o i c, ty
[02:40:28] <Cork> parveen: just run it after?
[02:40:34] <hrusti> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/tgb4kom8/ cant I?
[02:40:41] <parveen> no
[02:40:44] <Cork> func(); otherFunc()
[02:41:02] <Cork> parveen: yes that will run in order
[02:41:18] <Cork> parveen: if you do something async in the first function you have to provide a callback
[02:41:27] <parveen> Cork , if func()  took time to return then otherFunc()  will execute
[02:41:33] <Cork> cause the code actually continues before so it will run out of order
[02:41:43] <Cork> parveen: no
[02:42:07] <Cork> parveen: if func() took 5 minutes to run otherFunc() would run after 5 minutes
[02:42:34] <Cork> parveen: if func() used something like setTimeout/setInterval/ajax to do parts of its work then yes otherFunc() will run first
[02:42:38] <Cork> but it will ALWAYS run first
[02:42:51] <Cork> even if func()s code took 2ms to run
[02:42:59] <kokut> cork is it .eq(0) or .eq('0') ?
[02:43:06] <Cork> kokut: the first
[02:43:10] <kokut> k
[02:43:30] <parveen> Cork
[02:43:30] <parveen> http://pastebin.com/7VLLgpPG
[02:43:51] <Cork> parveen: what is the code in get_event_task ?
[02:44:10] <parveen> this function call some ajax function and return html
[02:44:15] <Cork> there you go
[02:44:21] <Cork> parveen: if func() used something like setTimeout/setInterval/ajax to do parts of its work then yes otherFunc() will run first <--
[02:44:37] <Cork> only way to handle that is to provide a callback
[02:44:48] <parveen> how ?
[02:45:14] <Cork> for ex you could use .then() and return that value from the function
[02:45:44] <Cork> and then do get_event_task().done(function() { get_event_budget(eventId); })
[02:46:08] <Cork> and  get_event_budget will most likely have to do the same cause i guess it uses ajax too
[02:48:57] <parveen> Cork
[02:49:04] <parveen> you mean like this  - http://pastebin.com/3bBneuqV
[02:49:32] <Cork> parveen: no
[02:50:13] <parveen> http://pastebin.com/E2Kq7SiJ
[02:50:45] <Cork> parveen: http://jsfiddle.net/t3pnzome/
[02:51:02] <Cork> that assumes the functions not included has been modified correctly
[02:51:18] <parveen> Cork , Thanks
[02:51:19] <parveen> trying now
[03:04:39] <dimi1947> I am trying to collect the value of 2 or more input element....I am trying to use a loop for it but i cannot....in addition to that I am thinking that maybe it is a problem that all input elements have the same class name  https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/86wqy91h/
[03:05:08] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/86wqy91h/2/
[03:05:19] <Cork> dimi1947: give the fields proper unique names and use .serializeArray
[03:06:55] <dimi1947> aare you referring to the classes names?
[03:07:13] <Cork> <input name="unique[name]">
[03:07:40] <parveen> Cork  ; it shows error  -    get_event_task(...).done
[03:07:48] <parveen> is not a function
[03:08:00] <Cork> ya, cause you didn't do the change in the function i talked about
[03:10:04] <parveen> i did , coz its like
[03:10:06] <parveen> http://pastebin.com/tXTUNakd
[03:16:13] <parveen> Cork ?
[03:42:29] <Kartagis> hi
[03:56:20] <Cork> parveen: like i said, you have to modify so you process the $.ajax deferred value through .then and then return that from the function
[04:03:39] <surianup> Hi firneds
[04:03:43] <surianup> How are you all
[04:04:00] <surianup> I need to get the help from you guys please
[04:04:05] <surianup> any one can help me
[04:04:33] <surianup> I have a click function and Have get the value there
[04:04:53] <surianup> and need to pass that value to other click function
[04:04:58] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/27pmg8y9/5/
[04:05:03] <surianup> this is my url
[04:10:15] <surianup> monk3y
[04:11:08] <monk3y> surianup.  How can I help?
[04:11:33] <surianup> I need to sebd the value from one clcik function to other one
[04:11:41] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/27pmg8y9/5/
[04:12:26] <surianup> I have get hte the value in the $('.deleteport').click(function(){ and need to pass that vakue to $('#click_yes').click(function(){
[04:12:32] <Cork> surianup: http://jsfiddle.net/27pmg8y9/6/
[04:13:45] <monk3y> So, just as Cork's done it, you need the value available if and when the second on(click) fires?
[04:14:07] <monk3y> Like a set-then-confirm kinda action?
[04:19:36] <bobbobbins> hey, I added an onclick to an icon I added inside an anchor tag, if they click anywhere else in the anchor tag i want it to do what it normally does(which is execute some react.js code), but if they click the icon I want to cancel that action. I attached an onclick to the icon itself with a return false, and it triggers that, but the return false doesn't stop the rest from firing...is there a way to do this?
[04:21:27] <surianup> Cork
[04:21:27] <surianup>  i have checked this
[04:21:40] <surianup> but it is givng me undefiend
[04:23:13] <bobbobbins> stopPropagation doesn't work either
[04:23:33] <monk3y> bobbobbins: function(e) { e.preventDefault; } ?
[04:23:53] <bobbobbins> monk3y: maybe, let me try that
[04:25:01] <monk3y> Sure.  So $("#iconId").on("click", function(e) { e.preventDefault(); .. } etc?  It's been a while since I've cranked this out.  Please add a grain of salt.  Heh.
[04:25:18] <bobbobbins> nope, still triggers...I'm not sure if javascript in general just doesn't like it, or if the reactjs code on it is doing something funky, I'm not all that familiar with react
[04:25:54] <bobbobbins> yeah, return false I think is supposed to do the equivalent of those functions, but even adding all 3 in a row it won't work
[04:26:08] <Cork> bobbobbins: the best solution is to bind a click handler on the link, and check if the this.target is the icon
[04:26:09] <monk3y> Ok.  So you've got the <a> wrapped around the icon (<img>) ?
[04:26:16] <Cork> instead of killing the event
[04:26:33] <Cork> opps sorry event.target not this.target
[04:26:52] <bobbobbins> monk3y: yeah, its an <i> in an <a>
[04:27:04] <bobbobbins> Cork: let me see if that is possible with the way this is set up
[04:27:09] <Cork> (also try make a jsfiddle)
[04:28:26] <monk3y> Yeah Cork's way sounds better than my idea; break the <a> up 'around' the <img>.  So <a></a><img/><a></a>.  I'm not a smart man.
[04:30:47] <monk3y> surianup: are you still stuck on the id being undefined in the second click-handler?
[04:31:02] <surianup> yes monk3y
[04:32:02] <surianup> Cork have gave this but Cork it's givin me undefiend http://jsfiddle.net/27pmg8y9/6/
[04:32:20] <surianup> please help
[04:32:49] <Cork> surianup: when is click_yes shown?
[04:33:07] <surianup> when we click on the button
[04:33:16] <monk3y> bobbobbins: Like Cork said; a JSfiddle makes the world go 'round.  Or at least it makes your solution come quicker.
[04:33:40] <surianup> then when we clcik on the delete button
[04:33:53] <surianup> delete button id is clcik_yes
[04:34:04] <surianup> Cork
[04:34:16] <Cork> the first click handler never fires
[04:34:43] <surianup> there are 3 buttons when you clcik on the any button then it fires
[04:34:56] <Cork> nope
[04:35:02] <monk3y> surianup: where are any elements with the .deleteport class?
[04:35:13] <Cork> and that is expected as the class isn't set on it
[04:35:13] <surianup> ohh shit man
[04:35:26] <surianup> you are right
[04:35:50] <Cork> surianup: also i would bind submit on the form instead of click on the button
[04:36:00] <monk3y> Ah yeah, so it bubbles.
[04:37:41] <surianup> Cork
[04:37:41] <surianup>  how to bind this on form?
[04:40:01] <Cork> surianup: http://jsfiddle.net/27pmg8y9/10/
[04:43:18] <surianup> Cork but i need to submit that foem when I have click yes
[04:43:28] <surianup> on the second function
[04:43:41] <Cork> surianup: $('form')[0].submit()
[04:45:46] <surianup> Cork it means it shoud not submit the form
[04:45:53] <surianup> m i right?
[04:45:55] <Cork> why not?
[04:46:15] <Cork> stupid hot key...
[04:46:51] <surianup> I have not enough knowledge knowledge about jQuery buddy
[04:47:06] <Cork> surianup: you want a submit, so handle the submit
[04:47:10] <surianup> that why its going from my head
[04:47:24] <Cork> you want a confirmation so abort the submit when you get it and show the confirmation
[04:48:26] <surianup> can you see the commented line
[04:48:27] <surianup> /$('#deleteForm'+id).submit();
[04:48:30] <surianup> cork
[04:48:41] <Cork> $('#deleteForm'+id)[0].submit();
[04:48:43] <surianup> I have to used this to delete the form
[04:49:17] <Cork> or you could set a value on the form to indicate that the deletion is confirmed if you prefer that
[04:50:04] <surianup> ok let do first
[05:12:02] <surianup> Cork
[05:12:06] <surianup> you there?
[05:12:21] <Cork> surianup: just ask the question directly
[05:12:42] <surianup> I have get the id
[05:12:50] <surianup> and now I ma goinf to delete
[05:12:55] <surianup> the form
[05:12:59] <surianup> with $('#deleteForm'+id)[0].submit();
[05:13:12] <surianup> But one thing I want to ask
[05:13:22] <surianup> why [0]
[05:13:31] <deepy> surianup: please keep your sentences together, you don't have to use ENTER instead of a comma
[05:13:32] <Cork> [0] is to get the raw dom object
[05:13:43] <surianup> we also can use like this $('#deleteForm'+id).submit();
[05:13:55] <Cork> no cause that will fire the jquery event loop
[05:14:05] <Cork> [0].submit != .submit()
[05:14:12] <Cork> it's two different methods
[05:14:19] <Cork> one is a dom native function
[05:14:41] <surianup> which I have to use [0].sumit
[05:14:44] <surianup> submit
[05:14:49] <surianup> ?
[05:15:00] <Cork> yes, as you don't want to risk firing event loops
[05:15:20] <surianup> ok brother
[05:15:21] <Cork> submit > confirm dialog > confirm dialog > confirm dialog :)
[05:15:21] <surianup> Thanks
[05:15:52] <surianup> ok ok
[05:25:12] <threesixes> little help plz =D on visible toggleclass fixed on not visible toggleclass fixed most efficient way to write this?
[05:25:37] <Cork> by visible you mean?
[05:26:32] <threesixes> im writing a mediawiki skin, the searchbox is either absolute or relative, the navbars are fixed
[05:27:11] <threesixes> the auto complete suggestions
[05:27:49] <threesixes> so that becomes visible i need to change the display to fixed for it to scroll the page with the position staying the same
[05:28:11] <Cork> so... "<Cork> by visible you mean?"?
[05:29:52] <threesixes> so div.suggestion becomes visible, i need to add the class "fixed", when it's not visible i need to remove the class fixed
[05:30:30] <Cork> ... "<Cork> so... "<Cork> by visible you mean?" - could you answer the question?
[05:33:16] <threesixes> .suggestion's div starts out on load as display: none, it changes to display block when it has suggestions
[05:37:42] <surianup> Thanks Cork
[05:39:59] <taplar> threesixes: you could possibly use a MutationObserver - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[05:43:02] <ashka> hi, is there a way to optimize this code ? and by that what I mean really is "is there a oneliner for it" http://paste.awesom.eu/g312/OkCQ
[05:43:43] <Cork> not if you want just the values no
[05:43:56] <Cork> well actually it can be cleaned up
[05:44:32] <Cork> var valString = $.map($('input:checked'), function(elm) { return $(this).val(); }).join(';');
[05:44:45] <Cork> it basically does the same thing though
[05:44:59] <Cork> damn sorry
[05:45:05] <Cork> var valString = $.map($('input:checked'), function(elm) { return $(elm).val(); }).join(';');
[05:45:39] <ashka> oh, that's what I'm searching for basically
[05:45:42] <ashka> thanks!
[06:25:38] <Bjerre> Hello everyone. I'm trying to find out a way to make my animation play in reverse when I click on a new active class. Right now, it will instantly remove the class from the previous active one. Anyone got any idea? http://jsfiddle.net/3Vbz8/13/
[06:28:55] <Cork> Bjerre: why don't you just use transition?
[06:30:12] <Bjerre> I'm not sure how to implement that Cork
[06:30:59] <Cork> Bjerre: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function
[06:31:07] <Cork> and then you transition to and from the class
[06:33:25] <Bjerre> ok thanks Cork, I guess that will work with mouse click as well? I think I tried this before but didn't know how to get it working with something else then hover
[06:33:43] <Cork> Bjerre: what action triggers it has nothing to do with the transition/animation
[06:33:54] <Bjerre> ok great
[06:34:02] <Cork> Bjerre: if you prefer to use animation, you would have to create an slide-out animation
[06:34:15] <Cork> and have it on the .toggle class
[06:40:19] <Bjerre> that went well Cork .... http://jsfiddle.net/3Vbz8/14/
[06:40:46] <Cork> jikes >_>
[06:40:47] <Bjerre> I'm sorry but I should probably study js
[06:41:06] <Cork> ya, you toggle active and active-reverse
[06:41:12] <Bjerre> yup
[06:41:24] <Cork> also reverse should be the default on .toggle
[06:41:29] <Cork> not a separate class
[06:42:29] <Bjerre> hmm I see
[06:42:47] <Cork> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/3Vbz8/15/
[06:43:19] <Bjerre> I love you Cork
[06:44:47] <Bjerre> From what I have heard, animating with scale will be a better idea since the image or object won't take the same time to load on each step and that it is on a sub-pixel level. Is that true Cork?
[06:45:25] <Cork> Bjerre: it gets gpu animated
[06:45:35] <Cork> so the actual dom doesn't change
[06:45:43] <Bjerre> isn't that better in most cases? I see
[06:45:50] <Cork> yes
[06:47:10] <Bjerre> Do you have any education in programming? I'm thinking about starting myself. Need to get a grip of it
[06:47:28] <Cork> self taught
[06:47:36] <Bjerre> damn
[06:47:47] <Cork> i learned pascal for dos back in the days :)
[06:47:54] <Cork> still self study
[06:47:56] <Bjerre> ok :)
[06:48:03] <Cork> but it is the only book i've ever read about programming
[06:48:10] <Bjerre> do you work with programming or just a hoby?
[06:48:14] <Cork> work
[06:48:19] <decx> people who don't self study dont make it through cs in uni anyway
[06:48:27] <decx> or they end up in management/copywriting
[06:48:37] <Bjerre> I see
[06:48:41] <Cork> decx: i meant i haven't had a minute tutoring time
[06:48:55] <Cork> never went on a course for "programming"
[06:49:07] <decx> yeah i'm just saying that people who go to college to become a programmer mostly fail
[06:49:11] <Bjerre> So you would not recommending spending 2 years educating?
[06:49:15] <decx> because you need that passion
[06:49:45] <Cork> Bjerre: for the knowledgeable? no, for the diploma to open doors, maybe
[06:49:51] <decx> a degree is still good
[06:50:07] <decx> but you are just fine with something other than cs
[06:50:08] <Bjerre> Passion I have decx, I'm missing the knowledge. Been jumping into projects that are quite big and haven't gotten the time to start from scratch and learning the basics
[06:55:14] <dANO> I have some css class like .article:before{content: "test"} I want to know if it's possible to change the css content "test" into "example" in js ?
[06:57:52] <Bjerre> Thanks again for your help Cork
[06:58:37] <Cork> dANO: yes, but not without modifying the css
[06:59:14] <Cork> dANO: <elm data-before="test" class="article"> .article:before{content: attr(data-before); }
[06:59:27] <Cork> and then you just change the data-before value
[07:00:06] <dANO> Cork: Oh ok
[07:05:45] <mento> Hi, anyone known with jQuery DataTables? I want  to use fnFilter() on a on click event, but it wont update the table. I does add a console log line when i click the anchor with the results
[07:06:13] <mento> http://jsfiddle.net/2eezzytn/
[07:20:04] <Bjerre> Cork: I'm getting some bluriness around the buttons in my project when they scale up. The blur disappear when the animation is done. Any tips on how to get rid of blur?
[07:20:24] <Bjerre> It's like a render problem it seems
[07:20:35] <Cork> ya, most likely
[07:21:02] <Cork> i suspect it is cause you don't exactly at the px
[07:21:04] <mento> Bjerre:  what browser? i've seen this in IE 11 aswel
[07:21:28] <mento> as well
[07:21:32] <Bjerre> perhaps Cork. I'm using crome mento. I tried out -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;     -webkit-transform: translateZ(0) scale(1.0, 1.0); }
[07:21:37] <Bjerre> and it made the blur stay on
[07:21:39] <Bjerre> even after animation
[07:21:56] <Bjerre> chrome"
[07:48:33] <MikeD_> i have a behavior i suspect is related to a delegated event handler being assigned again after the DOM object was removed (via a higher level dom object reference .empty() call )  and i'm seeing the event handler get called twice.
[07:48:40] <MikeD_> this is IE10, fwiw
[07:49:07] <Cork> MikeD_: sounds likely
[07:50:01] <MikeD_> i thought .empty() was supposed to clear event listeners
[07:54:01] <Cork> MikeD_: it empty is the same as setting .html('')
[07:54:19] <Cork> MikeD_: and yes it will clean up all the event handlers bound to the elements inside that element
[07:54:28] <Cork> but it won't clean up delegated event handlers to parents
[07:56:45] <MikeD_> in this case I have the topelement.on('click','etc') ... and topelement.empty() then a rerender of topelement.  So should I attach the listener to the child element or use .off() before calling the rerender (or is there a way to check the element already has the listener registered?)
[07:58:03] <MikeD_> it's an unusual/unlikely use-case, so i'd rather not add a bunch of complexity in the main codepath for catching a debug/utility use
[07:59:42] <MikeD_> meh, i guess:  ref.off( signature ); ref.on( signature ); is pretty obvious
[08:22:16] <graphettion> I'm trying to add an visited state without changing the layout. Can anyone help me out? - http://jsfiddle.net/zdbgovLt/4/
[08:27:46] <graphettion_> Disconnected. Errr.
[08:32:43] <graphettion_> I'm trying to add an visited state without changing the layout. Can anyone help me out? - http://jsfiddle.net/zdbgovLt/4/
[08:33:07] <Meir`> graphettion_, it's about the margin
[08:33:25] <Meir`> you mess with the img margin instead of the anchor
[08:33:39] <Meir`> wait, i'll update your fiddle
[08:33:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:35:35] <Meir`> graphettion_, i added a class "selected", instead of inline css
[08:35:38] <Meir`> have a look: http://jsfiddle.net/zdbgovLt/5/
[08:36:24] <graphettion_> Meir`: You're awesome, man! I feel like such a n000000000b!
[08:37:16] <Meir`> graphettion_, it's ok, we all have these days :D
[08:37:23] <graphettion_> :P
[08:37:27] <Meir`> btw, you better add     e.preventDefault();
[08:37:39] <Meir`> so it won't jump to the top with every click
[08:37:50] <Meir`> http://jsfiddle.net/zdbgovLt/7/
[08:38:52] <Meir`> and i hope that in your real app you select elements by id or class, and not simply by the element tag 'a'
[08:39:17] <robertmaxrees> Meir` it's very likely that this is a reduced test case ;)
[08:40:55] <Meir`> robertmaxrees, yeah, that's why i mentioned the real app, and used the verb "hope" ;)
[08:41:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:51:13] <graphettion_> Who honors specificity anymore? Select all FTW!
[08:51:22] <robertmaxrees> D:
[08:51:32] <graphettion_> </sarcasm>
[08:56:12] <graphettion_> Time to burn and churn. I need a plan to learn moar JS.
[10:25:54] <AbuDhar> hey
[10:26:04] <arthurvr> hey AbuDhar
[10:26:10] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[10:26:12] <AbuDhar> can I not have two dataTables in the same file?
[10:26:17] <AbuDhar> two different
[10:26:30] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean - could you show us what you're trying to do?
[10:26:38] <AbuDhar> indeed robertmaxrees :)
[10:26:47] <gambl0re> hi robertmatrix my friend...
[10:26:57] <robertmaxrees> hey gambl0re
[10:28:01] <AbuDhar> https://dpaste.de/Dtq5
[10:28:03] <AbuDhar> robertmaxrees,
[10:28:54] <robertmaxrees> AbuDhar that should work just fine.
[10:28:59] <robertmaxrees> are you getting any errors in your console?
[10:29:10] <AbuDhar> well it doesn't. the AJAX is never called in both of them when there are two DataTables.
[10:29:18] <robertmaxrees> what happens when there's one?
[10:29:23] <AbuDhar> oh wait
[10:30:00] <AbuDhar> missing a comma :P
[10:30:01] <AbuDhar> hehehehehe
[10:30:08] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it :)
[10:30:30] <AbuDhar> and I was wondering why the AJAX wasn't working :P I forgot to check the console tab
[10:30:37] <AbuDhar> was looking in the network :D silly me
[10:44:23] <AbuDhar> is there an easy way to export a dataTable to an excel or CSV file?
[10:45:04] <robertmaxrees> https://www.datatables.net/extensions/tabletools/
[10:45:59] <AbuDhar> robertmaxrees, neat :) let me have a look
[10:46:07] <robertmaxrees> google ;)
[10:46:44] <arc_> [02:21:59] <Cork> arc_: collect the elements and check the position().top
[10:46:48] <arc_> i was hoping that would not be the answer ;/
[10:51:13] <AbuDhar> robertmaxrees, https://cdn.datatables.net/tabletools/2.2.4/
[10:51:17] <AbuDhar> do I need all those files? lol
[10:51:51] <AbuDhar> hope not. I will start with the css and js files
[10:56:00] <robertmaxrees> AbuDhar i have no idea - this isn't a support channel for datatables or this plugin.  my guess is that you need the minified CSS, .png images, the minified JS file, and the //cdn.datatables.net/tabletools/2.2.4/swf/copy_csv_xls_pdf.swf file
[10:58:18] <AbuDhar> I will find out.
[11:01:54] <AbuDhar> but it's nice that it's so easy :D you don't even have to do much yourself..
[11:03:36] <robertmaxrees> that's the idea.
[11:05:57] <mkaufman> Can someone please help me get my datatable pagination working properly.  I'm need the Prev/Next buttons to pull from a 3rd party API that is already paginated. Same code: http://jsfiddle.net/at3spmss/5/
[11:06:05] <mkaufman> s/same/sample
[11:06:22] <AbuDhar> hahaha another dataTables question for you robertmaxrees :D
[11:06:26] <AbuDhar> ^^
[11:06:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[11:06:45] <robertmaxrees> no clue
[11:07:11] <robertmaxrees> mkaufman btw http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/at3spmss/6/
[11:07:16] <AbuDhar> mkaufman, sorry man. I already used the datatables question quota :)
[11:07:19] <robertmaxrees> don't include body tags in your HTML.
[11:07:33] <robertmaxrees> and put your JS inside the javascript area instead.
[11:08:23] <mkaufman> The api is written by me and is a wrapper around Amazon's Product API so if I need to expose other json elements I can (if the datatables require other info)
[11:08:53] <AbuDhar> robertmaxrees, where else should the body tags be? :P
[11:09:03] <robertmaxrees> you don't use them at all in jsfiddle.
[11:09:22] <AbuDhar> ooh in the fiddle :P
[11:09:25] <AbuDhar> I thought you meant generally.
[11:09:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:09:42] <mkaufman> robertmaxrees: ya i understand that jsfiddle doesn't want them.
[11:10:25] <robertmaxrees> cool - then start with a valid fiddle ;)
[11:10:52] <mkaufman> robertmaxrees: you already gave me one ;) ..
[11:11:01] <robertmaxrees> hurrr
[11:14:43] <arc_> hmm... can i do something like $('div.class').on('scroll', function() { if ($(this).position().top > $(this).height()) { ... } });
[11:14:53] <arc_> if i want to know when a user scrolled past something
[11:15:01] <robertmaxrees> arc_ nope.
[11:15:05] <arc_> damn
[11:15:06] <robertmaxrees> the window scrolls, not the elements.
[11:15:34] <arc_> well ... "The scroll event is sent to an element when the user scrolls to a different place in the element."
[11:15:38] <arc_> that's a little confusing then
[11:15:45] <robertmaxrees> "in the element"
[11:15:49] <robertmaxrees> as in, elements with scrollbars.
[11:15:54] <arc_> yeah i guess i get it now
[11:16:05] <arc_> sigh, this is going to be annoying
[11:16:10] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[11:16:15] <robertmaxrees> just see if the user scrolled past an element?
[11:16:33] <arc_> yeah. i'm making a userscript for imgur that scrolls to the next image in the gallery with a keyboard shortcut
[11:16:53] <arc_> i got it working, but if the user manually scrolls, it doesn't update the position the script thinks the user is in
[11:17:03] <robertmaxrees> the solution you got was pretty standard.
[11:17:23] <arc_> yeah, i was just hoping to find an easier solution :p lol
[11:17:27] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty easy.
[11:17:28] <arc_> but i guess i just have to do the work
[11:18:20] <samssh> I love getting a standard solution for a common problem. It makes every occurrence of the problem after that almost stress-relieving instead of stressful.
[11:18:39] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[11:18:40] <arc_> i'm trying to wrap my head around how i will have to deal with the arrays, i'm not super used to them
[11:18:56] <arc_> to say the least
[11:19:04] <arc_> but i'll figure it out
[11:19:05] <robertmaxrees> you mean the jquery object?
[11:20:05] <arc_> actually i guess all i have to do is like while ($(window).scrollTop > $('div.image').position().top)
[11:20:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:20:16] <robertmaxrees> you need to .each() in there.
[11:20:39] <arc_> yeah, true
[11:20:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L3k1gars/
[11:21:12] <robertmaxrees> just make sure you gather everything outside of the scroll event listener.
[11:39:21] <arc_> does using scrollIntoView() fire the scroll event
[11:39:47] <robertmaxrees> it'd be easy to find out.
[11:39:54] <arc_> k
[11:41:35] <arc_> apparently so
[11:44:41] <arc_> btw when i ask a question like that i'm not just being lazy, i just figure if somebody already knows the answer it's just a matter of typing "yes" or "no" so i may as well try :p
[11:45:07] <robertmaxrees> i figured.  i guess i'm just used to whipping up a fiddle super quick and finding out or whateve.
[11:45:09] <robertmaxrees> *whatever
[11:55:22] <zlude> Hello guys! I have an ajax that get content from a php, And then append content to a div. But I have another div that need to be displayed just if ajax div from php have content. I need to use setInterval to check it everytime? or can I use another way to do that?
[11:55:38] <robertmaxrees> the done callback of the ajax.
[11:55:56] <zlude> oooh, really! i missed that
[11:56:01] <zlude> thank you, alot!
[11:56:04] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:16:48] <Pazician> Is this like messy code or is it just fine, normal to read etc? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8b95c9dc53a4514cdf50
[12:17:12] <robertmaxrees> mixing tabs and spaces for indentation is a no-no :)
[12:17:36] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: What you mean?
[12:17:58] <robertmaxrees> your indentation is inconsistent - you mix using tabs and spaces to indent.
[12:18:16] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/dvmWQye.png
[12:18:35] <Pazician> Oh, that's not good to do?
[12:18:38] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:18:47] <Pazician> How's the right way?
[12:18:49] <robertmaxrees> mixing tabs and spaces for indentation is bad.
[12:19:24] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/mBg0ydx.png
[12:19:29] <robertmaxrees> replace all of these with tabs.
[12:19:52] <Pazician> I see, so I should follow that one?
[12:20:00] <robertmaxrees> use one or the othere.
[12:20:02] <robertmaxrees> never mix them.
[12:20:37] <Pazician> I'm using Sublime Text 3, and I don't get these dots, what are you using and how to you get these dots?
[12:20:44] <robertmaxrees> sublime text.
[12:20:50] <robertmaxrees> highlight it.
[12:20:57] <Pazician> Oh, alright. Thanks
[12:21:30] <Pazician> Do you mind me ask you what theme are you using?
[12:21:51] <robertmaxrees> sunburst
[12:21:58] <robertmaxrees> also - scrlToTop - just spell it out: scrollToTop
[12:22:11] <arc_> what is the page in the api about how to write a function
[12:22:17] <robertmaxrees> var funAnimHvr - funAnimationHover
[12:22:20] <robertmaxrees> arc_ what do you mean?
[12:22:30] <arc_> like what a function would be in c
[12:22:34] <Pazician> Alright, thanks robertmaxrees - thanks for the great support!
[12:22:50] <robertmaxrees> Pazician also, your scrlToTop has a big gotcha - you're re-binding an event listener in there.
[12:22:51] <robertmaxrees> that's bad.
[12:22:55] <robertmaxrees> arc_ still not following
[12:23:11] <robertmaxrees> there wouldn't be any jquery documentation about functions in C, arc_
[12:23:13] <arc_> i code some functionality and give it a name
[12:23:20] <arc_> then i can call it from somewhere else
[12:23:22] <robertmaxrees> that's basic javascript - MDN.
[12:23:25] <robertmaxrees> not jquery.
[12:23:30] <arc_> ok
[12:23:34] <robertmaxrees> var myFunction = function() {};
[12:24:43] <arc_> i copied the basic syntax from somewhere already, but what i wanted to look up was actually how to call the function when i'm not passing an object to it
[12:24:52] <arc_> i thought it would be $.functionName();
[12:25:04] <robertmaxrees> arc_ just functionName();
[12:25:08] <arc_> oh ok lol
[12:25:10] <robertmaxrees> don't attach to the jquery object like that O.o
[12:25:28] <arc_> well i guess that's just a byproduct of me thinking it was jquery not javascript
[12:25:35] <robertmaxrees> arc_ jquery IS javascript.
[12:25:40] <arc_> ya i know
[12:26:01] <robertmaxrees> then your last sentence makes no sense ;)
[12:26:13] <robertmaxrees> "i thought i was an orange not citrus" :)
[12:26:53] <robertmaxrees> to be able to do $.functioName();, you'd have to do $.functionName = function() {}; somewhere, which i'd avoid if I were you.
[12:27:15] <robertmaxrees> Pazician also, your btnTrigger function has the same gotcha.
[12:27:28] <robertmaxrees> Pazician basically, you need to invert your thought process on a lot of these.
[12:27:47] <Pazician> What you mean with "gotcha", what's that?
[12:27:55] <arc_> this is the syntax i copied from somewhere on how to define a function http://pastebin.com/Pu0NU3Un
[12:28:00] <robertmaxrees> you're binding those click event handlers multiple times, Pazician
[12:28:04] <robertmaxrees> which is bad
[12:28:08] <robertmaxrees> arc_ don't use that.
[12:28:14] <arc_> ok heh
[12:28:17] <robertmaxrees> unless you're making a plugin, that is.
[12:28:21] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Really? Where?
[12:28:49] <robertmaxrees> Pazician btnTrigger, scrlToTop, funAnimHvr does it with the hover.
[12:28:54] <robertmaxrees> same with hvrEffect
[12:29:23] <robertmaxrees> arc_ that format is for when you want to do $('someSelector').someFunction(); - not what you want here :)
[12:30:20] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I'm kinda lost, how do I call them more than one time? I do need to call the function, right?
[12:30:34] <robertmaxrees> Pazician why do you need to call the functions like that?
[12:30:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:30:41] <robertmaxrees> you're inverting your thinking.
[12:30:59] <robertmaxrees> in fact, btnTrigger doesn't need to be in a function at all.
[12:31:16] <Pazician> Lol, I'm so confused. How would I call the variable that has the function inside?
[12:31:25] <Pazician> Really?
[12:31:26] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to is what i'm saying.
[12:31:54] <Pazician> So it should work without even calling the variable like I did now?
[12:31:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:32:20] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/s64ce38/
[12:32:22] <robertmaxrees> that's all you need.
[12:32:29] <robertmaxrees> no need for the window resize or anything for that one.
[12:32:48] <robertmaxrees> also you probably don't need the return false; in there.
[12:33:30] <robertmaxrees> do you understand why?
[12:34:15] <Pazician> I kinda off, ugh god... You're so awesome on this. You can explain if you want, I would really appreciate it.
[12:34:34] <robertmaxrees> literally nothing in that function needs to re-run on window resize.
[12:34:42] <robertmaxrees> because all of the logic is already in the click event handler.
[12:35:39] <Pazician> Aah, yeah right. There's no need to even have that inside a resize, since there's no logic to it either, right?
[12:35:54] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing in there that needs to re-run on resize.
[12:36:22] <Pazician> Yeah, right. I've really a lot of stuff to learn...
[12:36:32] <robertmaxrees> can you see the other cases where that's true?
[12:36:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:36:35] <robertmaxrees> welcome to learning :D
[12:37:07] <Pazician> Hmm... I'll try, hold on a sec. Thanks, lol
[12:37:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm leaving soon for lunch.
[12:37:45] <Pazician> Oh, alright! Well, I just want to say a huge thank you for helping me out!
[12:38:02] <robertmaxrees> try finding the other instance before i go.
[12:38:14] <Pazician> Yeah, scrollToTop doesn't need resize, right?
[12:38:25] <robertmaxrees> that might, actually.
[12:38:29] <robertmaxrees> but we'll address that later.
[12:38:39] <Pazician> Alright, is there more than that one?
[12:38:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:38:56] <robertmaxrees> the only other two in that file :)
[12:39:04] <robertmaxrees> funAnimHvr and hvrEffect
[12:39:08] <robertmaxrees> rename those though.
[12:39:18] <Pazician> Why doesn't they need to have resize?
[12:39:27] <robertmaxrees> what in them requires resize?
[12:39:38] <robertmaxrees> (this is your inverted thinking at play :D )
[12:40:08] <Pazician> When I go in responsive mode and then go to desktop mode then it has to be in resize, right?
[12:40:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:41:12] <robertmaxrees> what about columns.hover(); needs to re-run on resize?
[12:41:16] <Pazician> Ugh... Never mind... It really doesn't...
[12:41:23] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:41:26] <Pazician> Lol
[12:41:30] <robertmaxrees> see why?
[12:41:39] <robertmaxrees> you're doing the same thing no matter what, basically.
[12:41:43] <Pazician> How am I even thinking, yeah... I think so.
[12:41:52] <Pazician> Lol, that's kinda funny tho
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> same thing with var hvrEffect = function() {
[12:42:43] <robertmaxrees> basically, the only thing that might need to be in a resize handler is scrlToTop
[12:42:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd double-check that though.
[12:42:55] <Pazician> Yeah, just removed the resize... Ugh, so basically only windowHeight has to have the resize, right?
[12:43:07] <Pazician> Really?
[12:43:09] <robertmaxrees> i'd fix your CSS so you don't need that.
[12:43:22] <robertmaxrees> winHeight is fixing a css problem it looks like.
[12:43:27] <Pazician> height: 100%?
[12:43:34] <robertmaxrees> that's part of it, yeah.
[12:43:44] <Pazician> Is there anything else?
[12:43:51] <robertmaxrees> select elements on instead of multiple times.
[12:44:08] <Pazician> What you mean?
[12:44:09] <robertmaxrees> *once
[12:44:17] <robertmaxrees> for instace.
[12:44:24] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/g9zj5s8/
[12:44:36] <robertmaxrees> this section - you select #main-header over and over.
[12:45:08] <Pazician> But that's targeting the classes, right?
[12:45:24] <robertmaxrees> sure - still could be better.
[12:45:26] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[12:45:39] <Pazician> Alright :)
[12:46:37] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/g9zj5s8/#url=zdqcb7d\
[12:46:46] <robertmaxrees> basically, you want to minimize calls to $() as much as possible.
[12:46:48] <robertmaxrees> it's expensive.
[12:47:25] <Pazician> Oh
[12:47:41] <Pazician> What's the differens between $var and var?
[12:47:49] <robertmaxrees> $var just signals it's a jquery object.
[12:48:02] <robertmaxrees> just a naming convention, nothing beyond that.
[12:48:23] <Pazician> So there's no function on that one, right?
[12:48:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:48:35] <Pazician> Like no meaning, I mean?
[12:48:46] <robertmaxrees> for $var?  it makes your code easier to read and reason about.
[12:49:00] <Pazician> Yeah, right. Oh, alright.
[12:49:03] <robertmaxrees> that way you avoid cases where you do $(someVar) where someVar is already a jquery object.
[12:49:23] <robertmaxrees> and you signal to other developers that they have access to jquery on that object.
[12:49:29] <Pazician> Oh, wow I never thought about that.
[12:50:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to grab lunch, but that should get you started :)
[12:50:09] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!
[12:50:40] <Pazician> Thanks man! I really appreciate your kind help!
[12:56:33] <arc_> so ... apparently if you call the attr('id') of an element that doesn't have one, jquery automatically assigns a number to it based on its position in the jquery object? that's what seems to be happening here anyway
[12:57:02] <arc_> or hm maybe not ...
[12:58:16] <Grego111> Hey guys im looking at my timeline and i see LISTERS amount bulding up in thousands , im not sure why its happening . since i dont have that amount. anyone can tell me ?
[13:07:19] <arc_> wow wtf -_- i found my problem
[13:07:30] <Pazician> arc_: What was it?
[13:07:43] <arc_> on imgur, the album images have a normal id attribute, until you click the button to load the rest of the gallery
[13:07:52] <arc_> then it all changes to "data-reactid"
[13:08:08] <arc_> why the fuck
[13:08:10] <Pazician> Oh, what're you doing here?
[13:08:31] <arc_> writing a userscript to allow you to use up/down arrow to scroll to the prev/next image in the current gallery
[13:09:02] <arc_> it was mostly working before but i thought i was changing it to a better way of doing it, and now i see that i don't actually know how i will do this at all now
[13:09:10] <Pazician> Oh, alright. But what has that with Imgur to do, you mean the real website Imgur?
[13:09:15] <arc_> yes
[13:09:36] <arc_> i don't understand the other question
[13:09:39] <Pazician> Are you a developer at Imgur, or what?
[13:10:04] <arc_> no, a userscript is basically like an extension to a website, written by a user
[13:10:17] <Pazician> Oh, alright
[13:10:20] <Pazician> Cool
[13:24:49] <arc_> well, i did a bunch of work on this and now this is just too annoying so i'm going to revert back to what i had before and i don't care about manual scrolling
[13:34:35] <sigtau|desktop> Why is it that when I bind an event delegate--let's say, to a <li> within <ul>--nothing appears to happen?  $("ul").on("click","li",function () { alert("test"); }); is the syntax I'm using, does that have to be within $(document).load ?
[13:35:09] <sigtau|desktop> er, document ready, not load
[13:36:19] <mooncup> put it inside a document ready
[13:36:30] <mooncup> also did the ul exist when the jquery was run?
[13:36:39] <mooncup> if it's created later it won't work
[13:37:17] <sigtau|desktop> It was created later.  I was under the impression on() was a bind that worked on dynamically created elements.
[13:37:25] <sigtau|desktop> Lots of stackoverflow posts seem to say so
[13:37:29] <robertLunch> sigtau|desktop nope.
[13:37:39] <robertLunch> the element you bind to needs to exist at time of binding.
[13:37:44] <robertLunch> child elements of that can exist whenever.
[13:38:28] <sigtau|desktop> Okay, so, I have a table whose rows are dynamically filled, and within one of those cells is a <ul> that contains <li> elements that are basically toolbar buttons.
[13:38:31] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events - 4th paragraph down, bold text.
[13:38:56] <sigtau|desktop> Would I bind the event to the table, and then delegate it to the procedurally created toolbar buttons?
[13:39:17] <robertmaxrees> sigtau|desktop you could do it that way, sure.
[13:39:32] <robertmaxrees> though that sounds funky - how do you have a <ul> in a table?
[13:40:00] <sigtau|desktop> well, the DOM for that looks like [...] <table> <tr> <td> <ul> <li>
[13:40:05] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[13:40:11] <sigtau|desktop> It validates just fine, and it's an inline list, stylistically
[13:40:20] <robertmaxrees> aye - just not the way i woulda done it lol
[13:40:34] <robertmaxrees> either way, if the UL and and li are created dynamically, bind to the table and you're good to go.
[13:40:47] <sigtau|desktop> Got it, I'll try that, thanks for the pointer
[13:41:23] <sigtau|desktop> And I can just bind it to the table by way of a class name or ID like always, correct?
[13:41:26] <sigtau|desktop> Or does it have to be a tag?
[13:41:34] <robertmaxrees> any valid jquery object.
[13:41:42] <robertmaxrees> so ID, class, tag, attribute selector...
[13:42:55] <sigtau|desktop> Cool.
[13:45:34] <sigtau|desktop> That worked.  Thanks again robertmaxrees
[13:45:44] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[14:47:05] <jqueryhhelp> Hello all
[14:47:11] <robertmaxrees> hello
[14:48:28] <jqueryhhelp> I have a question, I need to create a textarea with a control of lenght characters
[14:49:07] <jqueryhhelp> But without maxlenght, because it count enter key
[14:50:40] <jqueryhhelp> Ok, no
[14:50:49] <jqueryhhelp> I will try to explain better
[14:51:21] <sillyslux> try to ask, if it's a question :)
[14:51:34] <sillyslux> hi all
[14:52:38] <jqueryhhelp> I have a textarea and I want to control the lenght of characters, for example: max 30 characters to write in textarea
[14:52:45] <jqueryhhelp> How can I do that?
[14:54:17] <sillyslux> bind a keydown function that checks it's value.length
[14:55:47] <jqueryhhelp> Ok
[14:56:04] <jqueryhhelp> I have for example this:  $('textarea').keyup(function(){ ...
[14:56:53] <jqueryhhelp> How can I pas some parameter by textarea?
[14:57:37] <jqueryhhelp> Because I want pass the max. lenght that I want
[14:58:06] <sillyslux> http://jsfiddle.net/py66j62n/
[14:59:22] <sillyslux> put the max value in a variable?
[14:59:55] <banandana> I like to hack things with HTML
[15:00:02] <banandana> it's an elite hacker language
[15:00:33] <sillyslux> http://jsfiddle.net/py66j62n/1/
[15:02:00] <jqueryhhelp> Like when I did something similar in javascript, for example: <textarea onkeypress="checkLenght("25")"></textarea>
[15:02:22] <jqueryhhelp> sillyslux
[15:03:02] <arc_> you don't need to use keydown or keyup. there is an event for that
[15:03:07] <arc_> input
[15:03:29] <arc_> it fires when an input element's value is changed
[15:03:47] <sillyslux> arc_ so ...on('input',then?!)
[15:03:57] <arc_> yes
[15:04:12] <sillyslux> hmm
[15:04:50] <jqueryhhelp> Yes, but the value that I said it would be the max lenght of characters in my textarea: <textarea onkeypress="checkLenght("25")"></textarea>
[15:05:31] <jqueryhhelp> 25 would be the max lenght of characters in my textarea, how can I pass that value in jQuery?
[15:06:19] <arc_> why aren't you just doing maxlength="25"
[15:06:26] <arc_> then you can do .attr('maxlength')
[15:10:31] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/p1cc2b7x/
[15:11:07] <jqueryhhelp> arc_ because I have after problems with the max lenght, for example I have that textarea with maxlenght and I write : 12 (enter key) 3   . And I can't write more, if I count the textarea show me 4 characters :$
[15:11:34] <arc_> o_O
[15:11:49] <jqueryhhelp> arc_ Sorry with maxlenght=5 *
[15:14:38] <arc_> jqueryhhelp this seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/p1cc2b7x/1/
[15:14:47] <arc_> i do not see the behavior you are describing
[15:15:03] <arc_> it does count crlf as a character though
[15:15:43] <arc_> oh with maxlength 5
[15:15:58] <arc_> lol i thought of a hilarious solution
[15:16:34] <arc_> but it only works if they don't delete the newlines :p
[15:21:37] <robertmaxrees> what's going on?
[15:22:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/p1cc2b7x/2/ so if you drop length down to 5 you can only enter 5 total characters?
[15:23:41] <arc_> sorry, this is somebody else's issue
[15:23:55] <robertmaxrees> i read that ;)
[15:23:56] <arc_> his problem is that if you use maxlength attribute, it counts newline as a character
[15:24:00] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:24:09] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[15:24:15] <arc_> idk, i guess he doesn't want that lol
[15:24:27] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhhelp so you only want to count non-whitespace?
[15:24:41] <arc_> or maybe the character counter isn't reflecting the actual content of the input
[15:25:04] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhhelp clarify your problem maybe?
[15:25:40] <arc_> did you update that fiddle or was that me
[15:25:44] <arc_> i don't remember linking that version
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> i updated it.
[15:25:54] <arc_> lol, wow
[15:25:54] <robertmaxrees> you were selecting things weird.
[15:26:43] <arc_> oh right i forgot the first update is 1, that's where my confusion came from
[15:28:08] <arc_> okay, something weird is going on here
[15:28:14] <sillyslux> just learned about "no wrap- in <body>" in jsfiddle :(
[15:28:21] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/p1cc2b7x/4/
[15:28:42] <robertmaxrees> arc_ btw selectors like span#max are bad.
[15:28:59] <robertmaxrees> you're making jquery work harder than it needs to :)
[15:29:21] <arc_> okay
[15:29:39] <arc_> but do you see what is happening here
[15:29:40] <robertmaxrees> also: return what out of taht function?
[15:29:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:30:01] <arc_> it counts newlines, but the max is lowered by the number of newlines
[15:30:11] <arc_> even though i'm using the same variable to display the number of characters and compare to the max
[15:30:28] <robertmaxrees> huh>?
[15:30:35] <robertmaxrees> "the max is lowered by the number of newlines"?
[15:30:46] <arc_> if you just type characters with no newlines, you can type 25 characters
[15:30:52] <arc_> if you put 1 newline, now you can only type 24
[15:30:56] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:31:01] <robertmaxrees> it's counting the newline.
[15:31:09] <robertmaxrees> depending on the OS, that can be a variable number of characters.
[15:31:25] <robertmaxrees> actually, no, it's working correctly.
[15:31:57] <arc_> ok ... well before i did this, enter reduced the number by 1, and it still reduces it by 1 now, even though before, it didn't SHOW the counter increase when i hit enter, and now it does
[15:32:12] <arc_> what do you mean by working correctly
[15:32:13] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't "reduce" anything other than the number of remaining chars :)
[15:32:20] <arc_> that's what i'm saying
[15:32:28] <robertmaxrees> the input field accepts 25 total characters
[15:32:35] <arc_> it doesn't though
[15:32:42] <robertmaxrees> yes it does - newline is a character.
[15:32:58] <arc_> right, and it counts it. if you count up to 25 including newlines, it stops early
[15:33:04] <robertmaxrees> not for me./
[15:33:10] <arc_> ok ... why would that be
[15:33:13] <arc_> are you on linux
[15:33:14] <johnline3> butbutbutbutbutte
[15:33:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm on windows.
[15:33:26] <arc_> then i don't get it
[15:33:38] <johnline3> hi arc_
[15:33:51] <robertmaxrees> arc_ shoe me where you're seeing that.
[15:34:15] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p1cc2b7x/6/ works fine.
[15:34:21] <arc_> hm
[15:34:48] <robertmaxrees> and what's up with the return in there?
[15:34:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p1cc2b7x/7/ this works fine.
[15:35:19] <arc_> not here
[15:35:31] <robertmaxrees> so does the country function properly?
[15:35:39] <arc_> come again?
[15:35:43] <robertmaxrees> *counter
[15:35:53] <robertmaxrees> ie you hit "enter" and it decrements by one, the you hit different characters and it counts to 25?
[15:35:55] <arc_> the counter is wrong there but it's the right number of characters
[15:36:13] <robertmaxrees> so it's reflecting 24 but there are 25 chars?
[15:36:25] <arc_> whoa what the hell
[15:36:47] <arc_> i am very confused now
[15:36:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:37:11] <arc_> i type something, hit enter, and then when i try to type more, it removes the newline and puts my input at the end of the first line
[15:37:20] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[15:37:23] <arc_> yeah.
[15:37:27] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you using?
[15:37:29] <arc_> chrome
[15:37:35] <robertmaxrees> because it sounds like your stuff is broken.
[15:38:09] <arc_> try entering 24 characters, hitting enter, then typing more
[15:38:19] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:38:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p1cc2b7x/8/ works fine, too.
[15:38:56] <arc_> so hitting enter after 24 characters doesn't do anything weird for you?
[15:38:59] <sillyslux> haha same here
[15:39:04] <robertmaxrees> it enters a newline.
[15:39:09] <arc_> and then typing more after that
[15:39:19] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, chrome specific.
[15:39:20] <sillyslux> newline is deleted
[15:39:25] <arc_> what the hell is that
[15:39:27] <arc_> D:
[15:39:31] <robertmaxrees> that's chrome being chrome.
[15:39:37] <arc_> great
[15:41:03] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10030921/chrome-counts-characters-wrong-in-textarea-with-maxlength-attribute
[15:41:34] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/p1cc2b7x/10/
[15:41:37] <arc_> that's what i was going for earlier
[15:41:42] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, chrome isn't counting correctly.-
[15:41:48] <arc_> well that's awesome
[15:42:04] <robertmaxrees> btw you don't need return in there,.
[15:42:13] <arc_> ok
[15:42:20] <arc_> i need to go eat now, that was interesting
[15:42:31] <arc_> thanks :p
[15:44:36] <robertmaxrees> aaaa stop prepending selectors with tagnames.
[15:44:59] <arc_> SORRY
[15:45:19] <arc_> i just wasn't thinking about changing that right at that moment
[15:49:34] <Grego111> whats important when come to memory leaks , Retained Size and Shallow size is what i need to look for?
[15:49:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:50:14] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 are you having memory leak issues?
[15:50:19] <Grego111> Yes
[15:50:30] <Grego111> i think
[15:50:35] <robertmaxrees> are you sure it's memory leaks and not CPU performance?
[15:50:43] <Grego111> almost sure
[15:50:52] <robertmaxrees> so you've profiled it and confirmed?
[15:51:00] <Grego111> its really hard cuz my app is a bit big
[15:51:04] <robertmaxrees> because the profiler will tell you which function is causing your headaches.
[15:51:07] <Grego111> its not confirmed
[15:51:18] <Grego111> i was trying to locate it and couldnt
[15:51:31] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you using?
[15:51:34] <Grego111> couldnt know which one doing me headaches like u say
[15:51:35] <Grego111> Chrome
[15:51:41] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/cpu-profiling
[15:52:40] <Sal> hi . how can i trigger a click event of the first <a> in a <ul><li class="actItem"> list?
[15:52:57] <robertmaxrees> Sal select it and run .trigger('click') on it.
[15:53:10] <Sal> i did, but it seems not working
[15:53:13] <Sal> this is what i did
[15:53:31] <Grego111> would u mind to have a look?
[15:53:32] <Sal> var $item = $('.actItem').first();
[15:53:42] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 use your dev tools..
[15:53:44] <Sal> $item.trigger('click')
[15:53:50] <robertmaxrees> Sal make a fiddle.
[15:53:59] <Sal> for 2 lines?
[15:54:08] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what your markup looks like ;)
[15:54:15] <robertmaxrees> Sal also, it's worth noting that triggering events is generally a bad idea.
[15:54:17] <Sal> ok, let me try
[15:54:25] <robertmaxrees> as in, don't do it at all.
[15:54:29] <robertmaxrees> call the function you want inst3ead.
[15:54:31] <robertmaxrees> *instead
[15:54:36] <Sal> the problem, is that i need to execute a event handler
[15:54:52] <robertmaxrees> right, so abstract it and call it explicitly instead.
[15:54:52] <Sal> and it requires an event as parameter
[15:55:01] <Sal> how?
[15:55:09] <Sal> abstract it?
[15:55:24] <robertmaxrees> as in don't inline it?  give it a name?
[15:55:50] <Sal> its not inline
[15:55:57] <Grego111> Robert: how do i know if its cpu or memory leak
[15:55:57] <robertmaxrees> then call the function name.
[15:55:59] <Sal> its a function
[15:56:02] <robertmaxrees> boom done.
[15:56:06] <Grego111> i dont see anything abnormal on the cpu
[15:56:10] <Grego111> profiler
[15:56:14] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 and memory?
[15:56:15] <Sal> function itemType(e) {}
[15:56:26] <Grego111> in memory its really hard for me to understand it
[15:56:32] <robertmaxrees> Sal so what's the issue then?
[15:56:43] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 it's a great learning experience :D
[15:56:46] <Sal> i need to pass it an event. because it reader the event currentTarget
[15:56:59] <Sal> i have data on the <a> that needs to be read
[15:56:59] <robertmaxrees> Sal :( that sounds weird.
[15:57:08] <robertmaxrees> mind showing an example?
[15:57:14] <Grego111> robert: yes i listen to some youtube talking about it and read alot
[15:57:17] <Grego111> but its freaking hard
[15:57:25] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling
[15:57:26] <Sal> ok, i'll make a fiddle
[15:57:28] <Grego111> thats why i was wondering if someone can have alook
[15:57:44] <Grego111> i read this article already
[15:57:58] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 you might have some luck with that, but since this is a general support channel for jquery it kind of defeates the purpose of the channel :)
[15:58:15] <Grego111> yeah :/
[15:59:57] <robertmaxrees> you might get more help in ##javascript fwiw
[16:04:07] <Sal> robertmaxrees, never mond, i have problems with jsfiddle because of its white background color. too bright for my eyes
[16:04:20] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[16:04:20] <Sal> i'mm find a workaround
[16:04:27] <Sal> i'll
[16:04:28] <robertmaxrees> then find an alternative service?
[16:04:33] <robertmaxrees> that's really strange.
[16:04:37] <robertmaxrees> *your issue is, i mean.
[16:05:04] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're binding things in ways you shouldn't be.  triggering clicks is generally a bad idea.
[16:05:21] <Sal> ok, i'll avoid it
[16:05:40] <robertmaxrees> if you need some kind of reference to an element, find another way to handle that :)
[16:05:54] <Sal> i'm just setting up a new view with on top a tab bar
[16:06:02] <Sal> then, as content, a list of data
[16:06:04] <robertmaxrees> a backbone view?
[16:06:24] <Sal> so i was setting it up ad then fireing the first tab click so that the list loads
[16:06:24] <robertmaxrees> btw describing code is rarely effective.
[16:06:48] <Sal> ok, thanks for you time
[16:06:54] <Sal> i'll find a way out
[16:06:55] <Sal> thanks
[16:06:59] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[16:07:00] <robertmaxrees> okay
[16:13:38] <ghox> hi guys, do you know if it's possible to use click event on a select element in mobile web browsers, the reason why I'm using "click" instead of "change" is because I want to be able to click an option even if it's been already selected, my implementation works on desktop browsers but not on mobile :(
[16:13:56] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange issue.
[16:14:01] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to handle that case?
[16:14:14] <robertmaxrees> if something is already selected, why would re-selecting it matter?
[16:14:40] <ghox> because it will trigger a layer to select something different
[16:15:00] <robertmaxrees> but you've already selected it, so that layer should've already appeared...
[16:16:01] <ghox> I mean, if you select the first time "option A" from the drop down it will show a layer to with some settings, later you can re-select the same option an change the settings in the layer
[16:16:25] <ghox> *show a layer to set some settings
[16:16:30] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[16:16:36] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of an awkward UX imo.
[16:17:00] <robertmaxrees> but i'd check out maybe using .on('change click tap', ...) or something similar.
[16:17:15] <ghox> actually it's a valid case and works on desktop browsers quite well
[16:17:32] <ghox> but safari and chrome do something weird :P
[16:17:37] <robertmaxrees> i've never seen "re-selecting the same thing in a droupdown" working out well ever but okay
[16:18:34] <Grego111> when using jquery click events and the element is Removed from the dom its clearing the binding automaticly?
[16:19:00] <ghox> if you use remove yes
[16:19:30] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 it should, yeah.  if you're doing a lot of adding and removing i'd opt for delegated listeners instead.
[16:20:06] <sillyslux> gc does that, i think, and not immediately
[16:20:31] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux https://api.jquery.com/remove/
[16:20:37] <robertmaxrees> "Similar to .empty(), the .remove() method takes elements out of the DOM. Use .remove() when you want to remove the element itself, as well as everything inside it. In addition to the elements themselves, all bound events and jQuery data associated with the elements are removed. To remove the elements without removing data and events, use .detach() instead."
[16:20:42] <Grego111> hmm
[16:21:43] <Grego111> ok that means remove remove the event listers aswell
[16:21:44] <Grego111> ok
[16:21:45] <Grego111> thanks
[16:22:09] <sillyslux> interesting
[16:25:26] <ghox> no one with a similar case fighting mobile browsers with a re-select functionality? :P
[16:46:33] * der_herr_g 
[16:47:38] <Grego111> Hey guys, regarding detached elements , i read that when i remove the PARENT it still leave the childrens as a detacheds elements . my question is that how do i solve it at the first place, what should i do to remove them beofre i remove the parent to makes sure i wont have that situation
[16:48:28] <robertmaxrees> GC should come through and clean things up for you.
[16:48:34] <robertmaxrees> unless i'm misunderstanding the issue.
[16:48:39] <robertmaxrees> mind linking your source?
[16:49:27] <Grego111> its all over the net actually
[16:49:38] <robertmaxrees> link?
[16:50:25] <robertmaxrees> I'd love to see a reference.
[16:50:25] <Grego111> in my heap snapshot i always got just an google eeample i just found
[16:50:25] <Grego111> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18521254/cant-seem-to-cleanup-detached-dom-elements
[16:50:40] <robertmaxrees> so you're chasing down event bindings, right?
[16:50:53] <robertmaxrees> are you adding/removing a lot of content on your page?
[16:51:05] <Grego111> yes
[16:51:13] <robertmaxrees> you should be using delegation instead, then.
[16:51:18] <Grego111> i was going over the listers and it doesnt seems like i got leak there
[16:51:28] <Grego111> my events are just fine
[16:51:39] <Grego111> delegation on DOM, can u give me an example ?
[16:51:40] <robertmaxrees> errr, then you shouldn't be having any issues...
[16:51:54] <robertmaxrees> if the handers aren't the problem, delegation won't help.
[16:51:58] <robertmaxrees> *handler
[16:52:46] <Grego111> the listers u mean?
[16:52:57] <robertmaxrees> handlers.
[16:53:05] <robertmaxrees> .on() <- listener.
[16:53:11] <robertmaxrees> the function you pass to that is the handler.
[16:53:21] <Grego111> i dont think its that
[16:53:34] <robertmaxrees> right, so delegation ostensibly won't help.
[16:53:36] <Grego111> im starting to terminate some elements to see where those detached html comes from
[16:53:56] <robertmaxrees> what evidence do you have to support this "detatched" theory
[16:54:19] <robertmaxrees> and SO links don't count.
[16:54:20] <Grego111> the heap snapshot
[16:54:22] <robertmaxrees> your profiler does.
[16:54:30] <robertmaxrees> okay, cool.
[16:54:33] <Grego111> ;)
[16:56:05] <iamdesperate> I know chatrooms like this usually have some kind of "No meta questions"-policy, but: Is there anybody here who would be willing to take a look at my particular problem? :)
[16:56:33] <Grego111> threre is a change that even after refresh the heap snaphop still show old data even when i take new snapshot?
[16:56:48] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate sounds like you need a freelancer.
[16:57:23] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate try asking a specific question and we can help you out though :)
[16:57:38] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 hrm?
[16:58:08] <Grego111> i removed all HTML but i still have the dom detached elements on new snapshots
[16:58:15] <Grego111> same amount as before
[17:00:08] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 http://stackoverflow.com/a/16936890/923919
[17:00:16] <robertmaxrees> B and C are huge
[17:01:38] <Grego111> yes but i dont do it
[17:01:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:02:32] <Grego111> i just dont understand how come that i have detached on the heapsnap  which not exist anymore
[17:02:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:03:19] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to understand why those detached nodes are there?
[17:03:41] <Grego111> yes
[17:03:49] <iamdesperate> I think a freelancer would be overkill for this problem :)
[17:03:49] <Grego111> if i clean the HTML
[17:03:49] <iamdesperate> As for the specific question:
[17:03:49] <iamdesperate> I have a set of checkboxes, and there is a button which as an on-click event
[17:03:49] <iamdesperate> which calls a function that then changes some contents. In particular,
[17:03:49] <iamdesperate> this also uses a load()-function to reload the checkboxes.
[17:03:50] <iamdesperate> What I am then trying to do is to get the checkboxes into the same state as
[17:03:50] <iamdesperate> they were before (checked/unchecked). However, that does not work, probably
[17:03:51] <iamdesperate> because the selector is still stuck on the checkboxes before the load() event.
[17:03:51] <iamdesperate> Here is the relevant bit, as I thought it should work:
[17:03:52] <iamdesperate> http://pastebin.com/kfyQPWUB
[17:03:52] <iamdesperate> I would usually use an on()-event here, but I don't know which event I should
[17:03:52] <Grego111> i have 0 elements there
[17:03:53] <iamdesperate> bind it to?
[17:03:54] <robertmaxrees> woiah.
[17:03:59] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate don't do that again.
[17:04:00] <robertmaxrees> thanks.
[17:04:34] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 your issue is that you have javascript holding onto references for some reason.
[17:04:43] <robertmaxrees> that's why the GC never kicks in.
[17:04:44] <Grego111> u mean in the memory
[17:04:58] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 yes, in javascript.
[17:05:15] <Grego111> yes but how come it shows html elements if there is 0 in the html
[17:05:30] <robertmaxrees> they're detached.
[17:05:48] <Grego111> YES but i refreshed the entire page
[17:05:58] <Grego111> shouldnt it clean eveyrthing?
[17:06:06] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 yep.  looks like you have your last snapshot open.
[17:06:15] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate uh - where's the event binding?
[17:06:16] <Grego111> not really
[17:06:19] <Grego111> i deleted it
[17:06:50] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 dunno then mang.  refreshing the page should clear things out.  keep in mind that viewing page source and the DOM are different from each other.
[17:07:02] <Grego111> ok
[17:07:08] <Grego111> will try restart browser
[17:07:36] <iamdesperate> Here's the entire file, which also includes the event binding: http://pastebin.com/EiEYtmvp
[17:07:38] <Grego111> works
[17:07:58] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate so which line(s) specifically don't work?
[17:08:22] <Grego111> ok all the detached elelemts are connected to that
[17:08:24] <iamdesperate> 50 and 51
[17:08:44] <Grego111> notificationsTag = Container.children("div").children(".header").children(".notifications"); which i set inside a functin
[17:08:47] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate i'm not seeing where you do anything with the ajax return.
[17:08:55] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 you can use .find() btw.
[17:09:05] <Grego111> nah find is bad for mobile
[17:09:05] <robertmaxrees> .find('.notifications') instead of all those .children() calls.
[17:09:09] <robertmaxrees> huh
[17:09:11] <robertmaxrees> uuuh.
[17:09:15] <robertmaxrees> .find() is fine for everything.
[17:09:35] <Grego111> find takes too many resources when dealing with HUGE htmls on mobile devices
[17:09:45] <Grego111> find = bad
[17:09:47] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 it shouldn't be that bad.
[17:09:50] <iamdesperate> AJAX does not return anything if everything goes well. AJAX just triggers the webserver to call some python script which creates a number of plots, which are then loaded into the page
[17:09:51] <Grego111> it is
[17:09:58] <Grego111> belive me , i tested it from every angle
[17:10:00] <robertmaxrees> if you're having issues with a basic find, then your document is FAR too complex.
[17:10:05] <robertmaxrees> and you need to fix that first.
[17:10:10] <Grego111> nah
[17:10:13] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:10:18] <Grego111> i have no problems with that
[17:10:20] <robertmaxrees> performance 101.
[17:10:22] <Grego111> find = bad for mobile period
[17:10:23] <Grego111> haha
[17:10:25] <robertmaxrees> document complexity is bad.
[17:10:32] <Grego111> the app is huge
[17:10:38] <robertmaxrees> then make it less huge.
[17:10:38] <Grego111> there is nothing i can do
[17:10:41] <Grego111> i can not
[17:10:46] <Grego111> i shrinked it as much as possible
[17:10:54] <Grego111> anyways thats not the issue here lol
[17:11:03] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 it's indicative of the issue though.
[17:11:19] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate i'm not grokking something here.  you run some ajax and and then select some things to hide them.
[17:11:36] <robertmaxrees> fwiw .attr('value') should probably be just .val()
[17:11:54] <robertmaxrees> also: your $(this) isn't what you think it is there.
[17:12:01] <robertmaxrees> natve,
[17:12:03] <robertmaxrees> *maybe
[17:13:45] <iamdesperate> Apparently $(this) is not what I need it to be, yes… the question is how do I get it to be that? ;)
[17:13:55] <robertmaxrees> what do you need it to be?
[17:14:15] <robertmaxrees> ie - you do a console.log($(this)); - what is it, and what do you want it to be instead?
[17:15:14] <Grego111> ok detached elements gone :)
[17:16:07] <robertmaxrees> what'd you change?
[17:17:03] <Grego111> the things is notificationsTag contain all pages notifications elemts
[17:17:17] <iamdesperate> Okay, again, quick summary what I am doing: I click a button (the on-click-event for #regenerate, at the top of the file I linked). I then read out which checkboxes are selected. Depending on these, I am loading new content (loadcontent()). In particular, I am also reloading the <div> that contains the checkboxes (because I might get an additional
[17:17:17] <iamdesperate> one or lose one). I then want all the checkboxes that existed before to be in the same state as they where when the on-click() event was called.
[17:17:21] <Grego111> and in come cases pages got removed from the dom and notificationsTag still handle those elemts
[17:17:26] <Grego111> which not exists
[17:17:28] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate that doesn't answer my question.
[17:18:40] <iamdesperate> console.log($(this)) gives me: [input, context: input]
[17:18:49] <robertmaxrees> okay - is it the correct input tag?
[17:19:33] <iamdesperate> It has the correct value, yes
[17:19:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked :)
[17:19:53] <robertmaxrees> if you inspect that element, does it show the right one on the page?
[17:20:07] <robertmaxrees> also, is loadcontent calling some ajax?
[17:20:42] <iamdesperate> loadcontent is not calling any ajax, just some load() events
[17:20:50] <robertmaxrees> "load events"?
[17:21:10] <iamdesperate> Something like $("#blah").load('./blah.html');
[17:21:14] <robertmaxrees> that's ajax.
[17:21:20] <robertmaxrees> that's just a shorthand for $.ajax();
[17:21:23] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[17:21:31] <iamdesperate> I did not know that :)
[17:21:35] <robertmaxrees> now you do :)
[17:21:44] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[17:22:08] <iamdesperate> Okay, how does that knowledge help me now?
[17:22:09] <robertmaxrees> that's not a "load event", it's an ajax shorthand function.
[17:22:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to put all of the logic after it within its complete callback.
[17:22:30] <robertmaxrees> .load('someurl'
[17:22:43] <robertmaxrees> * .load('someurl', function() { /* your code here */ });
[17:23:51] <iamdesperate> Okay, that is something I was actually trying to avoid, because loadcontent() is called somewhere else, too, where I don't want this behavior for the checkboxes
[17:24:07] <robertmaxrees> then use deferreds.
[17:25:12] <iamdesperate> Care to elaborate on that? :)
[17:25:31] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/u3vvxve/
[17:28:37] <robertmaxrees> you have to use $.ajax() there instead of .load().
[17:28:59] <robertmaxrees> .load() returns a jquery object instead of a jqXHR so that won't work otherwise.
[17:29:22] <Grego111> robertmaxrees: thanks for the help im still investigating
[17:29:42] <iamdesperate> Ohhhh I am just starting to understand what's going wrong here… the script is not waiting for the load()-calls in loadcontent, right? It just continues, and it's changes get then overwritten when the load()-calls finish :O
[17:29:53] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate exactly.
[17:30:03] <robertmaxrees> because that version of .load() is asynchronous :)
[17:31:34] <jiggatrigga> yo are any of u guys running windows 8.1 on a laptop?
[17:31:56] <robertmaxrees> jiggatrigga you could use a VM to emulate 8.1
[17:32:01] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't matter if it's a laptop or not.
[17:32:33] <jiggatrigga> yes yes robert, but i need a live testing scenario prized at laziest solution, to the max
[17:32:46] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:32:52] <robertmaxrees> then download a vm and test it.
[17:32:57] <iamdesperate> Okay, and how do I make it synchronous (that sounds kinda stupid talking about _A_JAX)? Is the code you supplied meant to replace my loadcontent(), or is it meant as a synchronous function to load some content?
[17:33:09] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate you don't make it synchronous.
[17:34:45] <Grego111> basicly about GC i want to understand , since i read somewhere that GC dont work in some situationim still confused about htat . i was sure that if i have a function and inside of that i got varibles when function is done those varibles are getting clear
[17:35:05] <robertmaxrees> the setup i showed you is how you tackle this - change loadCOntent to use ajax and return it -> http://fixee.org/paste/65i999e/
[17:35:09] <iamdesperate> Yeah, well, how do I make it wait for load()? Or how precisely do I replace load() by $.ajax()?
[17:35:28] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate you don't make it wait ever.
[17:35:51] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate check out the docs for $.ajax(); - they're pretty clear.
[17:36:01] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 javascript GC works by reference counting.
[17:36:30] <robertmaxrees> Grego111 if the GC sees you're holding onto a reference, it doesn't clean it up.  there's plenty of reading material out there on the subject.
[17:41:51] <robertmaxrees> i gotta hop out soon.
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> looong day
[17:42:20] <iamdesperate> Haha tell me about it. Its 2:36am here :)
[17:42:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd go to bed at this point.
[17:42:36] <jiggatrigga> what strain will u be smoking tonight robert
[17:42:43] <robertmaxrees> jiggatrigga i don't smoke.
[17:42:54] <jiggatrigga> oh robert, the times we lead
[17:43:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:50:15] <jiggatrigga> does anyone know of a list of irc channels, just like a tv guide of freenode irc channels
[17:50:30] <robertmaxrees> sure - /list
[17:50:44] <iamdesperate> I got it to work :) I eventually decided to just add another parameter to loadcontent() so I know if I want the special checkbox behavior or not, and I can add everything into the *.load('..', function(){ ... })
[17:51:01] <robertmaxrees> iamdesperate that's another way to do it ;)
[17:51:26] <iamdesperate> Probably not the prettiest way, but at that time of the night it will have to suffice :>
[17:51:39] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:51:46] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out either way.
[17:51:49] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.

[22:46:13] <walabe> I don't know the correct JS referencing whatever
[22:46:26] <Palmer11> ? its telling you. “path/to/frame_001.jpg”
[22:47:59] <plexer> if i have this #firstPage in the url is it possible to hide an image using jquery?
[22:48:04] <walabe> I don't understand? Hence why I'm asking. So if my image is in "chronox-website\assets\img\threesixty\gold" do I do it as "\assets\img\threesixty\gold"
[22:48:19] <walabe> the "chronox-website" is the root folder
[22:50:39] <Palmer11> you do it like any other image
[22:50:48] <Palmer11> from say css, or html
[23:02:02] <walabe> thanks for confirming that for me palmer11 I justed wanted someone to check if I was right
