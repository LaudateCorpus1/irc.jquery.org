[01:00:45] <easyOnMe> hello
[01:01:22] <easyOnMe> I am currently using jquery and my drag and drop based application is working on desktop but when I opened it in mobile the drag and drop does not work
[01:01:37] <easyOnMe> what can I do to make the drag and drop work on mobile devices
[01:01:40] <easyOnMe> please help
[01:25:58] <BenderRodriguez> mmm
[01:26:02] <BenderRodriguez> mooooooooooooo
[01:26:23] <BenderRodriguez> easyOnMe: custom coded or using a jquery plugin
[01:54:23] <easyOnMe> BenderRodriguez: ok
[01:54:29] <easyOnMe> noted with thanks
[01:54:36] <easyOnMe> but what jquery plugin is that
[01:57:12] <BenderRodriguez> no. I'm asking you if you've custom coded this functionality
[02:14:49] <spoonUltra> Howdy
[02:17:09] <spoonUltra> I've spent the day trying to make this side menu slideToggle to no avail. Would anyone care to see the url?
[02:18:12] <spoonUltra> I could use some help understanding why .slideToggle isn't happening even though codepen says I'm free of errors.
[02:18:24] <spoonUltra> Maybe I'm not sourcing it correctly in the html? idk
[03:00:10] <spoonUltra> O_O
[03:01:28] <User100_> O_O
[03:27:02] <hellyeah> hey there
[03:29:09] <hellyeah> i am creating multiple datepicker lets say in first datepicker i select like march 1 -  march 31 when i create second datepicker i want to swich the month to next month because there is no point to show user month with all disabled dates. Is there any advice here i hope my engish is understandable. http://jsfiddle.net/xz4ftbv4/23/
[03:29:43] <hellyeah> or do i need custom logic for that?
[03:30:15] <User100_> O_O
[04:20:27] <hellyeah> hey anyone around?
[05:01:35] <xonx> Hi how i can add a placeholder with jquery to my inputs ?
[05:03:00] <sharpy35> hey guys, in javascript what is the best way to check user inactivity with multiple tabs and setTimeout method?
[05:03:16] <sharpy35> so like when the user was inactive for 10 minutes i want him to be logged out
[05:10:04] <brad> sharpy35: why would you do that in javascript?
[05:19:51] <spoonUltra> .
[05:21:16] <hellyeah> what happened?
[05:21:43] <sharpy35> brad: because its the only way i know how to do it
[05:22:40] <brad> what are you using for auth?
[05:40:07] <spoonUltra> Is it possible some CSS properties interfere with jQuery .slideToggle?
[06:09:43] <spoonUltra> k
[06:10:44] <spoonUltra> Anybody recommend an e-book on jquery offering an in-depth look?
[06:48:57] <Uhkis> spoonUltra: share the url
[06:50:09] <spoonUltra> Sure, but I've already made some improvements locally that I'll have to update. http://sandbox.blackbox.epizy.com/
[06:50:16] <spoonUltra> uhkis
[06:51:41] <Uhkis> spoonUltra: and where's the non-working slidetoggle?
[06:52:27] <spoonUltra> Well clicking About Me will slide out the panel titled Your Name.
[06:52:54] <spoonUltra> I was able to incorporate .slideToggle locally, and now I'm wondering how to include easing...
[06:55:04] <Uhkis> spoonUltra: your scripts.js is included before jquery
[06:55:38] <spoonUltra> Uhkis: Yeah, I wasted a lot of time today trying to figure that out haha
[06:56:37] <Uhkis> spoonUltra: http://fixingthesejquery.com/ you might wanna give this a read
[06:56:51] <spoonUltra> I appreciate it
[06:58:02] <spoonUltra> Uhkis: What syntax do you use to incorporate easeOutBounce in .slideToggle?
[07:00:02] <Uhkis> spoonUltra: http://api.jquery.com/slidetoggle/
[07:00:49] <spoonUltra> I've been using the documentation. I just haven't understood it.
[07:01:29] <spoonUltra> would it be like $("#example").slideToggle("slow", "easeOutBounce", function() {}); ?
[07:01:52] <Uhkis> http://api.jquery.com/slidetoggle/#slideToggle-duration-easing-complete is pretty straight forward
[07:02:35] <Uhkis> yes, that looks correct
[07:03:22] <Uhkis> slideToggle(400, 'easeOutBounce') is probably enough
[07:04:22] <spoonUltra> hmm
[07:08:16] <spoonUltra> Uhkis When I try it here it doesn't seem to work http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yOVZrX
[07:26:12] <jomofcw> Hello !
[07:26:28] <jomofcw> How can I know if a submit event is triggered by a click on a submit button ?
[07:29:57] <GuessX> jomofcw: if your testing log to console
[07:35:41] <jomofcw> GuessX ? I try to "dir" the "e.target" but can't find what I've to use in all those datas :/.0
[07:38:00] <GuessX> jomofcw: e.type i think
[07:40:03] <jomofcw> GuessX it seems to always gimme "submit" :/.
[07:43:50] <GuessX> throw some code up
[07:53:16] <hellyeah> hey
[07:53:17] <hellyeah> hey i am sorry my code is kinda long but you dont have to read it. I need a functionality i couldnt implement yet.  my code is here http://jsfiddle.net/xz4ftbv4/23/ line 253 and line 330 for datepickers. I have two datepickers.  Let say i choose March 16 "from" and March 31 "to" . When i create next element i want to show April 1 in   "from". But i see all disabled dates of March. How can i fix that thanks.  Please create datepicke
[07:53:40] <hellyeah> create another with plus you will see what i am talking about?
[08:08:38] <YamakasY> this works and loads my overview section on a page http://pastebin.com/HG3shGyV
[08:08:43] <YamakasY> but when I want to load another section on another page instead of overview. how would I do that ?
[08:09:43] <Uhkis> spoonUltra: you dont have jquery ui in that codepen
[08:10:47] <spoonUltra> Uhkis good observation
[08:13:33] <YamakasY> no-one a clue ?
[09:10:26] <hellyeah> hey anyone around :p
[09:14:17] <hellyeah> taplar:  hey
[09:14:23] <taplar> yo
[09:14:39] <hellyeah> may i ask a question?
[09:14:47] <taplar> go for it
[09:15:35] <hellyeah> hey i am sorry my code is kinda long but you dont have to read it. I need a functionality i couldnt implement yet.  my code is here http://jsfiddle.net/xz4ftbv4/24/ line 253 and line 330 for datepickers. I have two datepickers.  Let say i choose March 16 "from" and March 31 "to" . When i create next element i want to show April 1 in   "from". But i see all disabled dates of March. How can i fix that thanks. Hope it is understandabl
[09:16:15] <taplar> there should be a way to set the starting date on the datepicker
[09:16:26] <taplar> or month
[09:16:46] <hellyeah> you understand my question right?
[09:16:53] <hellyeah> do i need to repharaphrase?
[09:17:07] <taplar> i just responded to it... :/
[09:17:12] <hellyeah> :p
[09:17:26] <hellyeah> i cannot be sure just sorry :p
[09:18:09] <hellyeah> do you have any idea how can i be done?
[09:18:29] <taplar> check the docs
[09:19:11] <hellyeah> i am checking
[09:19:58] <taplar> any questions you have about how to use a plugin, you should really start at the docs
[09:20:31] <hellyeah> actually i checked the docs
[09:20:59] <hellyeah> but i may miss something
[09:21:13] <taplar> what did you check?
[09:22:23] <hellyeah> beforeShow
[09:22:26] <hellyeah> setDate
[09:22:58] <taplar> so you checked this page: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[09:23:09] <hellyeah> yes
[09:23:10] <taplar> and all the options it provides
[09:23:52] <hellyeah> yes
[09:24:25] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:24:32] <hellyeah> actually i kinda handled that
[09:24:39] <hellyeah> now i realized
[09:25:06] <hellyeah> hmm no
[09:25:16] <hellyeah> i have selectOtherMonths
[09:25:38] <hellyeah> but what i need is for example you select date from april and in "to" it will show april calendar
[09:25:50] <hellyeah> if you select from may "to" shows may calendar etc.
[09:26:29] <taplar> i just got it to show april when it opens
[09:27:35] <taplar> couple different ways
[09:27:41] <hellyeah> hmm,?
[09:27:48] <taplar> all i did was read the docs
[09:27:48] <hellyeah> like?
[09:28:21] <hellyeah> i used onClose
[09:28:33] <hellyeah> and defaultDate
[09:28:41] <taplar> i'm not helping you on this one.  the docs explicitly tell you how to do this
[09:29:18] <taplar> and from the logs you've asked this question atleast two other times today.  during that time you could have been reading the docs
[09:29:32] <greg_f> hello
[09:29:48] <taplar> yo
[09:29:59] <hellyeah> taplar:  you mean is there something for this?
[09:30:55] <taplar> "i'm not helping you on this one. the docs explicitly tell you how to do this"
[09:31:42] <taplar> today you get to learn to dig through docs, :)
[09:32:16] <decx> you broke taplar
[09:32:16] <greg_f> I'm using form.get(0).submit(function(){ alert('Submitted') }); but alert isn't shown. I think its bc http status answer is 204. How can I get it?
[09:32:40] <taplar> are you trying to do a binding?
[09:33:08] <Xatenev> greg_f: e.preventDefault(); ?
[09:33:10] <greg_f> .bind('submit', .. ?
[09:33:21] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am sorry :/
[09:33:22] <taplar> i'm asking if that is your intent
[09:33:24] <Xatenev> greg_f: You have to prevent the default action to not get redirected away
[09:33:26] <Xatenev> if you mean that
[09:34:03] <greg_f> Xatenev: it's good idea, thanks
[09:34:08] <taplar> hellyeah: not a problem.  this is something you need to learn.  i can give you an answer fast.  but you won't learn
[09:34:22] <taplar> the docs are there for a reason.
[09:34:58] <hellyeah> that sounds like a custom thing doesnt it?
[09:35:01] <taplar> and since it says pretty plainly how you can do what you want, you just need to read it
[09:35:27] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:35:36] <hellyeah> it is really obvious then
[09:35:38] <hellyeah> ic
[09:35:58] <hellyeah> brb
[09:36:26] <Xatenev> This guy is so weird.
[09:36:27] <Xatenev> :O
[09:36:31] <taplar> figure out what your wanting to do.  don't tell me, just tell yourself.  then read the docs and find what will do that.  then look at what it needs and see if you have all the pieces to do that.  if not, then your next step is to figure out how to get those pieces.
[09:36:50] <taplar> Xatenev: who?
[09:36:57] <Xatenev> this hellyeah guy :P
[09:37:00] <taplar> ah
[09:37:06] <Xatenev> Hes baiscally here for a year now or something.
[09:37:25] <taplar> *shrug* people learn at different paces.
[09:37:39] <taplar> there's also possibly a bit of a language issue
[09:38:11] * taplar runs to get a soda
[09:45:33] <taplar> hmm, i wonder if i showed up before hellyeah or after
[09:45:36] <taplar> idr
[09:45:51] <Xatenev> taplar: Before.
[09:49:43] <hellyeah> hey again
[09:50:03] * taplar waves
[09:50:17] <hellyeah> i dont know what it means
[09:50:20] <hellyeah> can you explain
[09:50:24] <taplar> it?
[09:50:28] <hellyeah> is it like watching or resting
[09:50:34] <hellyeah> wave?
[09:50:35] <shoky> to move your hand from side to side, to signal hello.
[09:50:39] <taplar> ^
[09:50:40] <slax0r> lol
[09:50:42] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:50:42] <hellyeah> ic
[09:51:02] <hellyeah> can i say wave instead of hello in conversation :=p
[09:51:05] <taplar> i guess i take that for granted.  is that not universal?
[09:51:16] <shoky> hellyeah: you can wave your hand at someone to signal hello
[09:51:21] <slax0r> http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/37346942.jpg
[09:51:22] <shoky> welcome to life/society
[09:51:27] <hellyeah> ic
[09:51:27] <Xatenev> shoky: :D
[09:52:09] <hellyeah> taplar:  could it be changeMonth?
[09:52:20] <taplar> what does it say?
[09:52:47] <taplar> and you can try it in jsfiddle to see, :)
[09:52:50] <hellyeah> it cannot be that
[09:55:23] <hellyeah> it can be goToCurrent
[09:56:12] <spoonUltra> Is it possible to incorporate a window push into jquery animate or slideToggle?
[09:57:37] <taplar> can you elaborate?
[09:58:40] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes i will be back
[09:59:29] <spoonUltra> I wish I had a mockup ready for that question. I want a menu to slide out, and the rest of the content on the screen to adapt to the space left on the screen.
[09:59:58] <taplar> sounds like possibly a use of flexbox
[10:00:27] <taplar_afk> which would be more of a css question
[10:00:37] <pexmar> Hey Guys, I've got a short question
[10:00:55] <spoonUltra> taplar thanks
[10:01:18] <decx> you just transform your content
[10:01:49] <pexmar> I'm using the fancy product designer and want to call a function if an event is triggered. Can you tell me how I can check if an event has been fired? (events on http://jquerydoc.fancyproductdesigner.com/classes/FancyProductDesigner.html#events)
[10:02:17] <Xatenev> $(element).on('eventName', function() {});
[10:03:49] <pexmar> I'm calling
[10:03:50] <pexmar> $("#collagen-designer").on('FancyProductDesigner#viewSelect', function() {
[10:03:51] <pexmar>                 alert("asd");
[10:03:51] <pexmar>             });
[10:03:56] <pexmar> but this doesnt work
[10:12:25] <taplar> pexmar: can you make a fiddle?
[10:12:28] <pexmar> thanks, it worked. the event didnt do what i wanted. but the code was correkt. BIG THANKS!
[10:12:38] <pexmar> just fixed it one sec ago :D
[10:12:43] <taplar> ah, nvm
[10:12:48] <taplar> sweet, ^_^
[10:13:07] <pexmar> had todo it without FancyProductDesigner# and use another event
[10:13:09] <pexmar> :-)
[10:36:08] <hellyeah> hey
[10:36:10] <hellyeah> again
[10:36:11] <hellyeah> xD
[10:37:35] * hellyeah continue looking
[10:44:42] <hellyeah> taplar:  is it possible to give me small tip?
[10:44:54] <taplar> nope
[10:44:58] <taplar> i mean it is
[10:45:01] <taplar> but i'm not gonna
[10:45:32] <taplar> restate what your trying to do
[10:45:33] <hellyeah> okey
[10:45:47] <taplar> and not the whole thing
[10:46:01] <taplar> your creating a new datepicker and you want to ....
[10:47:30] <hellyeah> you are creating datepickers "from" and "to" let say you select March1 - March 31. There is no meaning to show March in the next datespickers because all dates are disabled better to switch March to April. I want to switch calendar to next month in that case.
[10:47:53] <taplar> i just said don't restate the whole thing
[10:48:06] <taplar> " I want to switch calendar to next month in that case. "
[10:48:57] <hellyeah> i want to switch calendar to next month in case of there is no selectable dates. Does it seem okey?
[10:48:59] <hellyeah> :)
[10:49:12] <taplar> I want to switch calendar.
[10:49:17] <taplar> How do I switch calendar?
[10:49:29] <taplar> What's does 'switch' mean?
[10:49:47] <taplar> change?
[10:49:47] <hellyeah> switch is wrong word here?
[10:49:52] <hellyeah> change yes
[10:49:53] <decx> it's been weeks i'm gonna get back into this, so you want to have an interface where you can select ranges of dates throughout an entire year
[10:50:02] <taplar> :)
[10:50:21] <taplar> change what about the calendar?
[10:51:07] <hellyeah> decx:  i did an interface that uses two different plugins one is for selecting daterange the other is for colorizing this range
[10:51:23] <hellyeah> decx:  i am sorry i make you bored about that
[10:51:23] <decx> well i dont care about that
[10:51:27] <decx> i mean like the big picture
[10:51:41] <decx> you want to select ranges of dates throughout a year
[10:51:46] <hellyeah> decx:   yes this is the big picture you are right sir
[10:51:50] <decx> right
[10:51:58] <hellyeah> decx:  you can select five year in one time also
[10:52:14] <hellyeah> like 1 march 2016 - 1 march 2020
[10:52:14] <decx> right right
[10:52:33] <decx> see this is the kind of baseline of information i never got from reading these 300 line fiddles
[10:52:48] <decx> ^^
[10:53:12] <hellyeah> hmm decx  you mean how documentation is important or you are talking about seperating this into small codes?
[10:53:16] <islalobo> Hello, looking for a better way to write this: http://kopy.io/3vWOs
[10:53:30] <hellyeah> taplar:  just changing the month
[10:53:44] <taplar> hellyeah: so is there an option to do that?
[10:53:55] <hellyeah> there is changeMonth option
[10:54:08] <taplar> what does it say that does
[10:54:21] <hellyeah> the month should be rendered as a dropdown instead of text.
[10:54:26] <hellyeah> i dont think it is related
[10:54:53] <taplar> read...
[10:55:39] <hellyeah> ah
[10:55:47] <hellyeah> onChangeMonthandYear
[10:56:21] <hellyeah> that can be it
[10:57:15] <taplar> what does that do?
[10:58:28] <hellyeah> takes date, month and year
[10:58:42] <taplar> huh?
[10:59:00] <taplar> that's an event handler dude
[10:59:18] <taplar> "Called when the datepicker moves to a new month and/or year."
[10:59:25] <hellyeah> yes
[10:59:34] <taplar> your trying to figure out how to change the month
[10:59:46] <taplar> aka, do the change, not detect a change
[11:00:05] <taplar> right?
[11:00:25] <hellyeah> i try to do change
[11:00:31] <hellyeah> aha
[11:00:34] <hellyeah> right
[11:01:11] <hellyeah> i understand
[11:01:52] <taplar> islalobo: i'd usually suggest a template but your setting a lot of data attributes.  which you could still use a template, or create the object, and then set the data element with data() instead of all the string concats
[11:02:43] <hellyeah> hmm
[11:02:58] <hellyeah> actually i am doing this when inputs are on same level
[11:03:17] <taplar> how do you change the month?
[11:03:24] <hellyeah> for example you choose april 1 in "from" and you see april calendar in "to"
[11:03:28] <taplar> focus
[11:03:34] <hellyeah> focus?
[11:03:36] <taplar> how do you change the month?
[11:03:39] <hellyeah> focus event?
[11:03:43] <taplar> stop thinking about other things
[11:03:51] <taplar> focus on one small issue
[11:04:05] <hellyeah> datepicker("option", "defaultDate", selectedDate);
[11:04:06] <taplar> figure it out, then move on
[11:04:10] <taplar> yay!!!!!
[11:04:27] <hellyeah> i really some mind's obstacle :D:D:D
[11:04:55] <hellyeah> hmm
[11:04:57] <hellyeah> i guess
[11:05:04] <hellyeah> i can use maxDate + 1
[11:05:08] <hellyeah> or something
[11:05:17] <hellyeah> ops
[11:05:24] <hellyeah> SelectedDate + 1
[11:05:25] <taplar> so now go play with that and see what you can figure out
[11:16:44] <hellyeah> hmm
[11:16:59] <hellyeah> i have to get the date from .to when it is closed
[11:17:41] <hellyeah> and when i click ".from" i have to set those dates as starting date or smt
[11:18:46] <hellyeah> taplar:  you there
[11:19:12] <taplar> yep
[11:20:36] <hellyeah> did i make sense?
[11:21:07] <taplar> did you?
[11:21:31] <taplar> doesn't matter if i understand it.  you gotta understand it, :)
[11:21:58] <hellyeah> well
[11:22:08] <hellyeah> i have to get the dates from to
[11:22:12] <hellyeah> "to"
[11:22:27] <hellyeah> and when i click input box "from" that is newly created
[11:22:42] <hellyeah> i should set mindate that is selected in "to"
[11:23:55] <hellyeah> there is onSelect
[11:24:16] <hellyeah> but onSelect will get you result when you select dates
[11:25:37] <mmmveggies> Just use $thing.on('select' ...)
[11:26:29] <hellyeah> i think onSelect
[11:26:43] <taplar> why do you need an event?
[11:27:24] <taplar> your already creating the new datepickers as part of an existing event, no?
[11:27:42] <hellyeah> good question
[11:27:58] <hellyeah> because i will show calendar when i click input box
[11:28:06] <hellyeah> change event is triggered
[11:28:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[11:28:29] <taplar> can you change previous date rages after a new date range is created?
[11:28:38] <hellyeah> no
[11:28:44] <hellyeah> i disable it
[11:29:06] <taplar> ok, so when is the earliest that you could use the to date?
[11:29:33] <hellyeah> can you repeat the question?
[11:30:09] <taplar> at what point of the existence of the new date range, would be the earliest point in which you could use the previous to date
[11:30:40] <hellyeah> when i create second datepickers
[11:31:07] <taplar> so think on that
[11:33:06] <hellyeah> i think i need to change this line -> $body.find('.datePicker').last().find('.to').datepicker("option", "defaultDate", selectedDate);
[11:36:14] <hellyeah> anyway i need to go now
[11:36:27] <hellyeah> may be i came back later for quick look
[11:36:31] <hellyeah> have a good day
[11:36:36] <taplar> you the same
[11:36:52] <hellyeah> i need to eat smt before hitting the road
[11:38:31] <mmmveggies> hellyeah: You can make oat/honey/peanut butter energy bars at home, it's literally just those 3 ingredients. SUPER delicious I reccomend
[11:39:01] <taplar> you guys would start talking food right before lunch...
[11:39:47] <mmmveggies> I have a quart of soup :)
[11:40:36] <awkwardCough> so do you mix and heat the oat/honey/peanut butter and then cool it into bars?
[11:41:53] <mmmveggies> melt the honey, add the oats/pb, lay out on a sheet, bake for a bit, let it cool
[11:41:58] <mmmveggies> oh I usually add some butter
[11:42:49] <awkwardCough> sounds good
[11:43:13] <mmmveggies> super simple calories
[11:44:10] <Xatenev> mmmveggies: ??????
[11:44:13] <Xatenev> awkwardCough: ??????
[11:44:37] <awkwardCough> Xatenev: !!!!!!
[11:44:49] <Xatenev> awkwardCough: No thanks. :P
[11:44:50] <mmmveggies> Xatenev: snack recepies
[11:45:00] <Xatenev> Just wondering whether #jquery goes #food ?
[11:45:18] <awkwardCough> all jquery programmers eat at some point :/
[11:46:28] <awkwardCough> but touche all the same
[11:46:29] <mmmveggies> unless they just drink smoothies with rum in it
[11:46:41] <mmmveggies> which I assume would provide all the nutrition you need
[11:46:50] <taplar> wtf?  you got spy cameras on me?
[11:46:59] <taplar> not cool bro
[11:47:25] <mmmveggies> more a dig at my roommate
[11:47:28] <mmmveggies> unless you are he
[11:47:33] <mmmveggies> quick, name all the Cohen brothers movies
[11:49:03] * taplar watches as awkwardCough prepares a retort
[11:49:46] <awkwardCough> :/ well now the surprise wikipedia google is ruined
[11:50:21] <taplar> i didn't say what you were doing.  you could have been making a cats montague or something
[11:51:05] <awkwardCough> great now the other surprise is ruined
[11:56:19] <islalobo> taplar what do you mean by 'template'
[11:57:38] <taplar> put your basic html on your page in between a script tag and pull it from there.  or if you do that sort of operation a lot in your app all over the place you could do the same with some libraries out there like handlebars
[12:01:43] <taplar> silly vpn
[12:02:49] <taplar> in any case the idea is to not have the html in your javascript
[12:15:53] <islalobo> taplar yeah, I don't like having the html in js. things got out of hand
[12:55:44] <Sal> robertmaxrees, still there?
[12:56:02] <robertmaxrees> sure, along with almost 660 other people ;)
[12:56:10] <Sal> gush
[12:56:11] <Sal> :)
[12:56:26] <Sal> remember what you did for me last night?
[12:56:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:56:43] <robertmaxrees> and i didn't do anything *for* you - I was trying to help you learn ;)
[12:56:58] <Sal> :)
[12:57:17] <decx> when do i get done
[12:57:26] <robertmaxrees> \huh?
[12:57:33] <decx> oh for you
[12:57:36] <Sal> anyway, it was the myIntermediary stuff
[12:57:36] <decx> huehuehue
[12:57:49] <robertmaxrees> hue
[12:57:57] <robertmaxrees> Sal did you have a question?
[12:58:28] <Sal> the problem with it is that it applies properties and events to all elements like the last one
[12:58:43] <Sal> i think that it only keeps in mem 1 element, and thats the last one
[12:59:12] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're referencing
[12:59:25] <Sal> so i think that at the end, i have to rewrite the entore javascript function into jquery
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> *javascript since jquery isn't a languae.
[12:59:43] <robertmaxrees> *language.
[12:59:49] <robertmaxrees> and i suggested you rewrite that function anyway.
[12:59:50] <Sal> ok, ok, i got it
[13:01:57] <Sal> i don't think it will eb that easy because it contains animations, anyway... 1 question...
[13:02:47] <Sal> are ObjectName.prototype.function used to have the functions public?
[13:03:37] <Sal> never mind
[13:03:41] <Sal> thanks anyway
[13:13:04] <islalobo> taplar looking at how to return an array of values and trying to figure out how to make use of template, as you suggested. http://kopy.io/1dixn
[13:15:50] <taplar> where's that other paste you had?
[13:15:57] <robertmaxrees> medicationsArray = key + obj.cardAdherenceScheduleId; wat
[13:16:06] <robertmaxrees>  var medicationsArray = {}; that's an object, not an array.
[13:16:19] <robertmaxrees> check out .map()
[13:26:15] <taplar> islalobo: short contrived example of what i was talking about: https://jsfiddle.net/5wek894L/
[13:26:43] <islalobo> taplar http://kopy.io/3vWOs
[13:28:22] <ifuseris> i need help targeting a class and performing an action
[13:28:30] <robertmaxrees> ifuseris okay.
[13:28:35] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[13:30:09] <ifuseris> well im at the initial phase of assessing how to best accomplish the task. and what I have here is this situation   http://178.159.11.199/opulent-travel/   on that page im trying to target those yellow circles in our process, and not havethem do their fade in visual composer action, but fade in pictures, not these yellow circles..so im thinking i c
[13:30:09] <ifuseris> ant really hack out the 3 circles from css because they are all inter embdedded in this visual composer javascripts functionality...so im thinking use jquery to hijack in some images for these circles..
[13:30:13] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:30:26] <robertmaxrees> so generally we want a standalone test case.
[13:30:51] <islalobo> taplar can I reproduce the same template depending on how many objects I have?
[13:31:12] <taplar> sure, you mean your repeating parts?
[13:31:21] <robertmaxrees> ifuseris and doing what you want via JS is doable - learn.jquery.com
[13:31:56] <ifuseris> of course its doable but would u recommend a point of reference with a javascript command that typically performs this kind of switcharoo
[13:32:14] <robertmaxrees> sure - the learnign center will show you how.
[13:32:23] <robertmaxrees> *learning
[13:37:11] <taplar> islalobo: https://jsfiddle.net/5wek894L/1/
[13:37:29] <taplar> it's all up to your creativity
[13:41:38] <ifuseris> fuck the learning center
[13:41:42] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:41:48] <robertmaxrees> not cool, yo.
[13:41:52] <ifuseris> thats cheating yo
[13:42:06] <robertmaxrees> so what has you confused then?
[13:42:19] <ifuseris> I put my pants on backwards that was the start of it
[13:42:34] <robertmaxrees> it starts with the basics.  it's a great resource.
[13:42:58] <ifuseris> well you have adequately defended it I will try it now
[13:43:23] <ifuseris> whats the switcharoo command
[13:43:41] <robertmaxrees> it depends on how and what you want to do.
[13:43:48] <robertmaxrees> .html() is one way.
[13:45:46] <ifuseris> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/     most basic concept of jQuery is to "select some elements and do something with them.    i see all the content on this page as all reference to how to select elements
[13:45:54] <ifuseris> but where is the action of when selected then DO action
[13:46:21] <robertmaxrees> the very next page.
[13:46:21] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/working-with-selections/
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> there's a link at the bottom right of that content for it :)
[13:47:32] <robertmaxrees> the section after that is called "Manipulating Elements"
[13:48:05] <ifuseris> yes getters and setters ya?
[13:48:11] <ifuseris> now we're gettin it robert
[13:48:20] <robertmaxrees> hrm?

[13:48:47] <robertmaxrees> under "working with selections"?  yeah.
[13:48:52] <robertmaxrees> the learning center has what you need.
[13:48:58] <robertmaxrees> which is why i pointed you there.
[13:49:18] <ifuseris> what was the purpose of this line ? W"hich is why i pointed you there. "
[13:49:54] <robertmaxrees> You seemed intent on not using it and was acting like it wasn't a good resource before :)
[13:49:56] <taplar> to let you know that's why he pointed you to that site, as opposed to just having a brand deal
[13:50:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:50:46] <ifuseris> Nice one boss, cheers.
[13:51:04] <robertmaxrees> Sure
[13:57:41] <robertmaxrees> what's everybody working on today?
[13:58:06] <taplar> minor refactoring while watching awkwardCough work some defects
[13:58:57] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[14:02:37] <macabre> hey guys, i'm building a simple chat where each chat message has an unique id. what i'm trying to accomplish is if a message id hits the top of the div it will fire a function to mark the message as 'read'
[14:03:38] <macabre> message id === div
[14:05:12] <taplar> having trouble wrapping my head around that
[14:05:28] <macabre> haha sorry i explained it pretty badly
[14:05:47] <decx> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/decx/5wek894L/2/
[14:05:48] <robertmaxrees> probably need to compare the scrolltop against the height of the containeror something.
[14:05:51] <robertmaxrees> all about offsets.
[14:05:59] <macabre> i have a chat container div, with messages nested inside
[14:06:06] <robertmaxrees> (make a fiddle)
[14:06:17] <macabre> if a user scrolls up, when the message id is in view, it will mark it as read
[14:06:48] <taplar> decx: that's cool too
[14:06:56] <decx> you said to be creative ^^
[14:07:08] <taplar> not you!
[14:07:09] <taplar> lol
[14:07:13] <decx> eh whatevs
[14:07:34] <decx> wonder what kind of weird problems that could generate
[14:07:46] <macabre> robertmaxrees: can you explain a little more?
[14:07:48] <decx> let's just call it the worlds smallest templating engine
[14:07:50] <taplar> interesting so with the chat, new messages are not immediately viewable?
[14:07:57] <taplar> visible
[14:08:14] <macabre> taplar: have you used slack?
[14:08:20] <macabre> or gitter?
[14:08:25] <taplar> nope
[14:09:08] <taplar> i'm guessing it's something like fb were you see "2 new messages" before you actually view them or something?
[14:09:23] <macabre> not exactly
[14:09:40] * taplar is googlin
[14:11:01] <macabre> irc doesn't do this but if it did, lets say you left your desk and came back all the messages above the chat container div would be 'unread'
[14:11:22] <macabre> so you would scroll up and 'read' them
[14:11:27] <taplar> sure
[14:12:19] <macabre> thats pretty much what i'm after
[14:12:32] <macabre> if i scroll up, i'd like to fire off a method that 'reads' the messages
[14:12:42] <taplar> i'd agree with roberts statement then
[14:13:09] <macabre> i'm just trying to figure out how i can use the scrollbar, container div, and element ids to accompolish this
[14:17:22] <DeltaHeavy> If I want something to happen only after 3 different async operations are done completing, how would I go about doing this? There anything I can do with $.Deferred?
[14:17:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:17:30] <robertmaxrees> .when
[14:17:39] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[14:17:47] <DeltaHeavy> Reading up on that now. Thanks!
[14:18:12] <taplar> macabre: so your scrolling from the bottom up?
[14:18:46] <macabre> taplar: yes
[14:19:02] <taplar> should it be 'read' when part of it is in view or all of it is in view?
[14:19:07] <macabre> the chatroom will load messages and the scrollbar will goto the bottom of the messages
[14:19:11] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Is .when() a part of the Promise/A+ spec?
[14:19:47] <macabre> taplar: it should be 'read' if the user scrolls ups and the full div is at the top of the container
[14:19:59] <taplar> ok, so once it's entirely in view
[14:20:03] <macabre> so once that full div is in 'view
[14:20:05] <macabre> yes
[14:20:05] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy nope.
[14:21:14] <taplar> which would mean that your containers scroll distance from the top would be equal to or less than the vertical position of the element in the contained element
[14:21:26] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Is there any way I could do this that would be compliant with that?
[14:21:37] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy erm, why?
[14:21:55] <macabre> taplar: thats the part i'm unclear about
[14:22:01] <DeltaHeavy> Wondering how this would be done with a similar library that's only A+ Promises complaint.
[14:22:13] <macabre> measuring the distance to the top
[14:22:14] <DeltaHeavy> I can think of some ways but they're dirty.
[14:22:18] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy so you're not asking w/r/t jquery?
[14:22:37] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise is what you want to read then.
[14:22:50] <taplar> macabre: so here is the scroll part http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[14:22:52] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all is available, but it depends on what library you're using.
[14:22:53] <DeltaHeavy> I might end up using jQuery for this but in general we're using the promises library with Mithril. If I can't do it easily I'll just end up using jQuery for this.
[14:22:59] <DeltaHeavy> Not using Babel -YET- on this specific project either.
[14:23:03] <DeltaHeavy> Else I'd just use Promise.all
[14:23:08] <taplar> and i believe it would be innerHeight or height() for the container
[14:23:40] <DeltaHeavy> MithrilJS's promise library is pretty basic.
[14:23:42] <taplar> err, hold on, wrong thing
[14:23:45] <robertmaxrees> link?
[14:23:57] <robertmaxrees> since you're not really in a mithril support channel, it's hard to help ;)
[14:24:33] <taplar> macabre: http://api.jquery.com/position/
[14:24:39] <shoky> DeltaHeavy you should find a generic method to turn a jquery promise into a Promises/A+ compliant promise, shouldn't be more than a couple lines of code. and then you're set with Promise.all
[14:24:56] <DeltaHeavy> shoky Not using ES6 sadly.
[14:25:12] <shoky> oh
[14:25:15] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Yeah, almost nobody uses Mithril though and the promise library is mostly a very basic Promises/A+ implementatin.
[14:25:32] <robertmaxrees> shoky he's not even curious about jquery - he was in here ytesterday asking if he could have carte blanche permission to ask OT questions.
[14:25:33] <shoky> then make your own .all
[14:25:35] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:25:39] <shoky> or find one ;p
[14:26:21] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees I might actually end up using jQuery for this though.
[14:26:40] <robertmaxrees> then you want .when() - problem solved for the jquery version :)
[14:27:21] <DeltaHeavy> But yeah, sadly the general purpose JS channels here aren't very inclusive so I'm not welcome there.
[14:27:27] <robertmaxrees> "inclusive" how?
[14:27:39] <robertmaxrees> nvm - i'll PM you to talk about it.
[14:28:04] <macabre> taplar: so with scrolltop and position i should be able to solve this?
[14:28:18] <taplar> i think it's a good start
[14:28:53] <macabre> okay, thanks
[14:30:15] <islalobo> taplar in the jsfiddle you posted ie https://jsfiddle.net/5wek894L/1/ can the key ex firstName be a key? What if I don't know how many results there are?
[14:31:44] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5wek894L/3/
[14:33:44] <Sal> does this code http://img.imgland.net/gv8jsS0.png
[14:33:52] <Sal> only wrap a div around element?
[14:34:01] <Sal> did i read it correctly?
[14:34:10] <robertmaxrees> that's not jquery duder.
[14:34:28] <Sal> robertmaxrees, i know, i have to convert it to jq
[14:34:33] <Sal> so where should i ask?
[14:36:29] <jphase> Sal: you can get javascript support in #javascript - ask back here when you're trying to write this with jQuery
[14:37:06] <jphase> also, you'll probably want to give them the context of that function so things like "this" will actually make sense ;)
[14:44:45] <taplar> macabre: are you able to keep a collection of the messages you've added to the container?
[14:45:09] <macabre> taplar: yes, all the messages are in an array
[14:45:18] <taplar> good.  i'm tinkering fwiw, :)
[14:45:20] <macabre> message obkects
[14:45:30] <macabre> taplar: hah okay :)
[14:46:59] <islalobo> taplar, sorry I meant the   var results = [ { firstName: 'Me', lastName: 'You' } ]; where first name and last name could be a variable depending on the objects returned
[14:47:00] <spoonUltra> When writing in jQuery, how do you know when you're supposed to include something in parenthesis?
[14:47:14] <robertmaxrees> spoonUltra what do you mean?
[14:47:40] <islalobo> I was looking at .push()
[14:47:58] <robertmaxrees> there's no jquery.push.
[14:48:04] <spoonUltra> robertmaxrees: What is happening when I surround something in parenthesis?
[14:48:21] <robertmaxrees> spoonUltra that depends on the context.
[14:48:23] <spoonUltra> robertmaxrees: How would you go about doing something like .push in jQuery?
[14:48:35] <robertmaxrees> there is no .push() in jquery spoonUltra
[14:48:45] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what you're trying to do?
[14:48:53] <spoonUltra> robertmaxrees: Are you saying there's no roundabout means to achieve that effect?
[14:48:54] <robertmaxrees> an example would help me clarify your confusion :)
[14:49:16] <robertmaxrees> explain what you're actually trying to do and give us an example :)
[14:49:25] <spoonUltra> robertmaxrees: I don't have a mockup available. I'll get back to you when I do.
[14:49:41] <robertmaxrees> errr, okay.
[14:49:51] <robertmaxrees> i meant more like a line showing where you're confused.
[14:51:55] <macabre> taplar: fwiw, i'm trying to mock this behavior : http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/guides/getting-started/
[14:52:07] <macabre> however, i'm not sure if i want to use a plugin yet :)
[14:57:59] <awkwardCough> macabre: taplar bribed me to give this to you https://jsfiddle.net/jby126r5/1/
[14:58:30] <macabre> awkwardCough: haha okay i'm checking it out now
[14:58:39] <macabre> hopefully it was a decent bribe
[14:59:07] <taplar> i stole his keyboard and said do it!
[14:59:26] <awkwardCough> so to recap... not a good bribe
[14:59:29] <taplar> lol
[14:59:36] <macabre> ahaha
[15:00:11] <macabre> i'll have a look, thanks guys
[15:00:12] <taplar> not my fault he has a bigger monitor
[15:03:17] <decx> taplar: one line templating confirmed https://jsfiddle.net/eu0zf4hs/3/
[15:03:37] <taplar> lol
[15:03:46] <taplar> damn
[15:05:19] <islalobo> taplar this is me trying to do what you suggested: http://kopy.io/T2UdZ
[15:06:04] <taplar> how's it lookin?
[15:06:39] <ABM_Dan> Cooked up some code for toggling elements with radios/selects, can someone give c/c? https://jsfiddle.net/bmoq3gx9/
[15:07:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd favor using filter with functions instead of selectors.
[15:07:26] <robertmaxrees> and i wouldn't ever select on data attributes.
[15:07:29] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan
[15:07:46] <macabre> taplar: did the fiddle work on your end? doesn't seem to be on mine..
[15:07:50] <ABM_Dan> That comes from the backend.
[15:08:03] <ABM_Dan> no classes for js hooks, only data-x
[15:08:08] <robertmaxrees> what.
[15:08:23] <taplar> macabre: which one we talking about?  the one i gave?
[15:08:27] <ABM_Dan> collision with names used by css paranoia.
[15:08:36] <robertmaxrees> then namespace classes used by js.
[15:08:41] <taplar> macabre: cause, yeah it worked.
[15:08:42] <robertmaxrees> or still use filter with functions.
[15:08:49] <macabre> taplar: hmmm
[15:08:54] <robertmaxrees> selecting on data attributes is very fragile.
[15:08:59] <taplar> awkwardCough: added a color to the .read class to make it visual
[15:09:09] <macabre> i see that it scrolls to the bottom but thats it :D
[15:09:09] <taplar> but he didn't save it, but you could do that
[15:09:15] <robertmaxrees> same with values, even.
[15:09:24] <awkwardCough> macabre: https://jsfiddle.net/jby126r5/3/
[15:09:47] <macabre> awkwardCough: :D
[15:09:47] <macabre> thanks
[15:09:49] <ABM_Dan> Assuming that classes are out of the picture, is there any other possible improvement?
[15:09:58] <taplar> so as you scroll up you'll see them switch from red to green as they are marked read, and the console log is still there
[15:10:08] <robertmaxrees> sure - use filter with functions instead to get what you want.
[15:10:20] <robertmaxrees> also, initialize vars when you declare them when possible.
[15:11:34] <robertmaxrees> also, this looks like you're using the select to get a radio that then gets a div - why can't the select have the data you need directly?
[15:11:55] <robertmaxrees> or is that the other way around?
[15:12:06] <decx> ABM_Dan: i did something similar the other day
[15:12:19] <macabre> taplar: yep, i was just missing that css
[15:12:32] <decx> ABM_Dan: https://jsfiddle.net/decx/h05v5yaq/
[15:12:32] <robertmaxrees> also: the dropdown and radios get out of sync with each other - they should update one another.
[15:17:41] <macabre> taplar: if the innerGuy div class was nested in a div, would that cause it not to work?
[15:17:55] <macabre> let me edit the fiddle
[15:17:55] <islalobo> taplar: not looking good. not getting the results to return
[15:18:53] <taplar> islalobo: nothing at all, or just not how it should look?
[15:19:28] <ABM_Dan> robertmaxrees: I only ever have one of them in a page.
[15:19:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:19:39] <ABM_Dan> There are multiples in that one so I could test them.
[15:19:53] <robertmaxrees> i give up then.
[15:20:00] <ABM_Dan> it's either radios in style 2 or 3, or the select.
[15:20:09] <ABM_Dan> It's ok, it tells me that the code is solid.
[15:20:15] <robertmaxrees> actually it's not.
[15:20:19] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[15:20:39] <decx> it's alright
[15:20:50] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ oh well
[15:21:00] <decx> move some stuff around
[15:21:03] <decx> done
[15:21:15] <robertmaxrees> use functions with filter instead of selectors.
[15:21:15] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[15:21:17] <islalobo> taplar nothing gets returned, but I can see some values in my console but it's a bit messy
[15:21:24] <decx> oh i looked at the wrong thing
[15:21:27] <taplar> (>'.')>-=[ congratulations ]=-<('.'<)
[15:21:28] <decx> yikes
[15:21:32] <decx> all them data lookups
[15:21:43] <ABM_Dan> What do you mean with "use functions with filter"?
[15:21:45] <DeltaHeavy> ABM_Dan This approach is really weird. I wouldn't go this route.
[15:21:49] <robertmaxrees> instead of selectors.
[15:21:52] <robertmaxrees> use functions.
[15:22:03] <robertmaxrees> since data attributes and input values are fragile for selectors.
[15:22:57] <taplar> islalobo: oh, one thing, on ln 23 your still referencing 'obj' instead of the passed in result
[15:23:28] <taplar> which if obj is indeed an object it should pass in (key) or (key, value) and use those
[15:24:29] <rtd1123> robertmaxrees: No more tables, but still lost in figuring this out. http://dev5.ahml.info/merci/availabilitygrid
[15:24:38] <robertmaxrees> rtd1123 hrm?
[15:25:32] <robertmaxrees> rtd1123 fwiw i barely remember what i ate for breakfast, so if you're referring to something from earlier today, i have no idea what you're talking about ;)
[15:25:32] <rtd1123> robertmaxrees: It's likely just because I'm awful with front end scripting, but I'm determined to get this working.\
[15:25:45] <robertmaxrees> also: fiddle is your friend :)
[15:26:05] <rtd1123> robertmaxrees: If you take a look at that page, and click on the "Check Availability" Button, you'll see what I'm saying
[15:26:18] <rtd1123> Just so you know where I'm at right now, I'll make a fiddle as well
[15:26:27] <robertmaxrees> rtd1123 where you are in relation to...?
[15:26:57] <rtd1123> where I want to be, of course
[15:27:12] <rtd1123> I am trying to make the existing "red area" movable to another area on that grid
[15:27:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't remember your particular problem.
[15:27:16] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:27:23] <rtd1123> sorry, I was writing up an explanation
[15:27:41] <decx> you're just helping too much
[15:27:47] <robertmaxrees> lol apparently?
[15:27:55] <robertmaxrees> i get lost easily lately.
[15:28:01] <rtd1123> you're just too quick for me
[15:28:05] <decx> there's only robe left, you're giving too much away ^^
[15:28:10] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:29:35] <taplar> "you guys playing strip poker"   "we can play poker?!?!"  *leaves quickly*
[15:29:47] <ifuseris> robert hows your front yard these days are u taking care of it?
[15:29:56] <taplar> woah
[15:30:00] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:30:01] <robertmaxrees> what.
[15:30:08] <taplar> bush joke
[15:30:20] * awkwardCough 
[15:30:24] <taplar> lol, i assume
[15:30:36] <ifuseris> http://old.robertmaxrees.com/
[15:30:42] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:30:46] <robertmaxrees> good god that's old.
[15:31:53] <decx> hey newer than my blog
[15:32:12] <decx> latest july 2008
[15:32:21] <robertmaxrees> that was really creeping me out for a second.
[15:32:29] <taplar> lol
[15:33:45] <decx> lulz http://decx.org/wombrocker
[15:33:59] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[15:35:11] <rtd1123> https://jsfiddle.net/rtd1123/g3kozw41/2/
[15:37:25] <rtd1123> so, if you try to drag the red area around, it makes it vertical and doesn't exactly replace the other content like I want to happen
[15:37:39] <robertmaxrees> do you have a specific question?
[15:38:03] <rtd1123> how can I make it move those 8 red cells onto another set of equal # of cells
[15:38:39] <robertmaxrees> on mousedown, find all adjacent "red cells".
[15:38:42] <robertmaxrees> start by doing that.
[15:39:07] <rtd1123> yep, got that part
[15:39:45] <islalobo> taplar I think it has to do with my results, they are an array of objects
[15:40:46] <taplar> so 'result' is an array?
[15:43:23] <islalobo> a keyed array of objects
[15:43:34] <robertmaxrees> "keyed"?
[15:43:38] <taplar> arrays can't be keyed
[15:43:46] <taplar> in js
[15:43:56] <islalobo> http://kopy.io/FCCwx
[15:43:57] <islalobo> indexed?
[15:44:02] <robertmaxrees> those are objects.
[15:46:22] <taplar> which would be why you can't do obj.cardAdherenceScheduleId
[15:46:34] <decx> you just need to precache all your items on load
[15:46:36] <taplar> that element belongs to the key value objects
[15:46:46] <decx> wait is was scrolled
[15:47:06] <decx> shit and extra s on my i, i should leave
[15:47:18] <decx> there's something on my eye
[15:47:38] <taplar> mmm if that's all it took to eject a person from chat, i'd never talk
[15:48:08] <islalobo> taplar: I fixed that reference. But I still can't get results to show
[15:48:47] <taplar> what's your latest kopy?
[15:50:34] <rtd1123> robertmaxrees: How do I actually swap the cells with the ones I'm dragging them to?
[15:53:05] <taplar> hmm, do you really want to swap them?
[15:53:30] <taplar> iirc, don't you have like data fields on them and stuff related to their times?
[15:53:47] <islalobo> taplar https://jsfiddle.net/gkkhe1r4/
[15:54:49] <rtd1123> taplar: yes there are datafields related to the times, but the point of dragging the item is to change the time of the reservation to the time associated with the new cells
[15:55:18] <rtd1123> so I guess you're right, I could just recreate it in the space that it lands in and delete the original, or something to that effect?
[15:55:29] <taplar> i guess what i'm getting at is, instead of changing the cells, don't you really just want to mark the different ones as selected or something
[15:55:44] <taplar> and unselect the old ones
[15:55:51] <taplar> your just trying to move the shading
[15:56:14] <rtd1123> yes, and on the backend, I have to update the time of that particular reservation
[15:56:41] <rtd1123> so, in theory once I move the cells, I do an ajax call, if successful, then highlight the new range of cells
[15:58:47] <taplar> islalobo: https://jsfiddle.net/gkkhe1r4/1/
[15:58:57] <taplar> the outer object is not an array.  $.each doesn't make sense
[16:00:07] <taplar> but if you move them, don't you then have to update the data elements?
[16:00:25] <taplar> rtd1123: ^
[16:01:52] <rtd1123> taplar, yes I have to update each data element that is moved and update the data elements from where those originated
[16:02:27] <taplar> but those are the same elements...
[16:02:40] <taplar> you moved them, there's nothing were they were now
[16:03:00] <rtd1123> well, the cells that it originated from would have to go back to the default settings for an unoccupied Room
[16:03:21] <taplar> yes, which is why i'm saying drag and drop is awkward here
[16:03:35] <rtd1123> suggestions for an alternative?
[16:03:53] <taplar> it's almost like you'd want to cancel the event so they don't actually move, but still do the logic of checking if you need to change the reservation css
[16:04:06] <taplar> imho
[16:04:15] <islalobo> taplay++
[16:04:39] <islalobo> xinfinity
[16:04:44] <rtd1123> or, I guess another way of doing this would be to simply start dragging and determine the destination cell time range, then modify the existing reservation to that new range/room/etc, then just reload the page, so make it more of a form submission
[16:09:43] <rtd1123> alright, back to the drawing board, I think your suggestions have moved me in a better direction
[16:09:50] <rtd1123> swapping seems pointless, you're right
[16:10:18] <taplar> i'm not saying you couldn't make it work.  it just seems heavy for what your wanting
[16:11:02] <rtd1123> you're totally right, and it doesn't have to be super elegent
[16:11:40] <taplar> where is your link again...
[16:11:54] <rtd1123> http://dev5.ahml.info/merci/availabilitygrid
[16:12:00] <rtd1123> or you mean the fiddle?
[16:12:06] <taplar> no, that's fine
[16:13:19] <taplar> just so it's been thrown out there.  have you considered: http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/
[16:15:11] <rtd1123> I haven't got to that point yet, but I will certainly consider that over the default one that's showing up
[16:15:52] <taplar> there a version a little lower on that page that actually does a date time range option
[16:16:20] <taplar> 'perioddatetimepicker'
[16:16:39] <taplar> their css for it is kinda uggo, but that could be changed
[16:17:30] <decx> isnt that what hell has been trying for 6 months?
[16:17:55] <taplar> kinda, but he's wanting shading based off of previous ones
[16:18:01] <rtd1123> that is pretty slick and actually I have a range field for another related project that could benfit from the PeriodPicker
[16:18:08] <Dr-007> hello, good evening to everyone. question; ive created a collesion detect function with jquery thats bound to the mouse movement. when the mouse moves it calls out my collision function which will foreach every element with class .something and then check if it collides with div .another-different-div. the detection works. but what im concerned about is the weight the all foreach loops will
[16:18:08] <Dr-007> cause. so basicly. is there a way to test the inpact of my script on a pc?
[16:19:08] <taplar> Dr-007: you could try using the profiling tools in the browser developer tools and see what that says
[16:19:31] <decx> you should have one output loop where you transfer your internal data on the relevant elements, never read from them after init
[16:19:40] <taplar> generally speaking in regards to mouse event handlers you want to limit your dom lookups and also throttling isn't a bad idea
[16:19:41] <plamble> is something like this allowed
[16:19:48] <plamble> .find('div.'$class)
[16:19:59] <plamble> if i wanted to search for 'div.one'
[16:20:07] <decx> it's still a string concat
[16:20:09] <plamble> where $class = one
[16:20:09] <decx> so +
[16:20:10] <taplar> + is the concat symbol
[16:20:25] <plamble> so .find('div.'+$class) ?>
[16:20:30] <taplar> or .find('div').filter($class)
[16:21:08] <taplar> ?> ?  are you mixing js and php?
[16:21:14] <plamble> not sure lol
[16:21:19] <plamble> filter seems like a cleaner solution
[16:21:23] <taplar> is $class a js or php variable?
[16:21:43] <plamble>  $(document.documentElement).find('div').filter($class)
[16:21:50] <plamble> should return all div's with that $class right
[16:21:53] <taplar> uh
[16:21:59] <taplar> $('div').filter($class)
[16:22:26] <taplar> no scope, it searches the whole document
[16:22:40] <plamble> whats going wrong here
[16:22:41] <plamble> https://jsfiddle.net/jqw0oqhf/6/
[16:22:52] <plamble> err
[16:23:04] <plamble> can you filter for a single class if matched elements have multiple classes?
[16:23:17] <taplar> yes
[16:23:20] <plamble> hmm
[16:23:38] <plamble> any idea what .active isnt getting applied on button click
[16:23:55] <taplar> you put a . on it
[16:24:07] <taplar> for addClass and removeClass, just give it the class name
[16:24:10] <taplar> it's not a selector
[16:24:38] <plamble> hmmm
[16:24:39] <plamble> https://jsfiddle.net/jqw0oqhf/7/
[16:24:53] <plamble> :(
[16:25:07] <taplar> but filter() takes a selector, :)
[16:25:18] <plamble> so should i use a concat there
[16:25:22] <plamble> '.'+$class
[16:25:26] <taplar> yep
[16:25:39] <plamble> worked
[16:25:40] <plamble> ilu
[16:27:39] <plamble> would be nice if those methods could either a select or the direct class name
[16:27:43] <plamble> selector*
[16:27:51] <plamble> could pass*
[16:28:01] <taplar> no . or # is a tagname
[16:28:36] <taplar> you could give it a custom function, but that's overkill
[16:29:23] <taplar> or maybe not.  not sure if finds still go into sizzle any
[16:29:24] <plamble> yeah its just idiots like me rarely can keep straight which methods take selectors vs direct names etc
[16:31:46] <decx> i wonder
[16:31:58] <decx> when do these sweeping removeclass calls become problematic
[16:32:07] <plamble> yeah i thought about that too
[16:32:08] <plamble> lol
[16:32:17] <decx> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=2.0.3&fn=jQuery.fn.removeClass
[16:32:19] <plamble> if active is being used anywhere else on the same level
[16:36:32] <decx> well you can filter for both $class and 'active' and toggleclass on there
[16:37:55] <plamble> yeah
[16:37:57] <plamble> just did that
[16:38:29] <DeltaHeavy> How would I use Array.prototype.map to return an array of functions WITHOUT binding 'this'? The function is predefined somewhere but I need to set parameter #1 of it.
[16:39:02] <taplar> hmm?
[16:39:56] <DeltaHeavy> I need to create an array of functions that can be called when accessing the array. I don't know how to use Function.prototype.bind to -NOT- bind that function's reference to 'this'.
[16:40:01] <DeltaHeavy> While still binding something for the 1st param.
[16:40:12] <decx> yeah i always just said goodbye sweet this
[16:40:22] <decx> when i need bind
[16:40:30] <decx> and dont have a direct reference
[16:42:10] <taplar> could you give it null?  *shrug*
[16:42:52] <DeltaHeavy> taplar No, would break the function >:
[16:42:54] <DeltaHeavy> Dang
[16:43:01] <decx> well you can give it anything but i assume the functions use this
[16:43:09] <DeltaHeavy> Yup
[16:43:12] <decx> yeah probably some arguments voodoo
[16:43:20] <taplar> heh
[16:44:06] <taplar> oh, so your wanting to bind, but retain what it's 'this' originally would have been?
[16:45:38] <DeltaHeavy> taplar Yep
[16:46:23] <taplar> hmm, well, instead of using bind, what if you turned it into a closure
[16:52:25] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/rdw6p7Lx/
[16:58:51] <YamakasY> I get some pagination back when I post and get a json form back and behind my url there is added /page-1/amount-1 is this default jquery handling for json tables ?
[17:10:02] <plamble> does siblings() include the element you're calling it from
[17:10:21] <plamble> so ('div.one').siblings() also include div.one in the matched elements
[17:10:43] <decx> no
[17:11:21] <plamble> hmm
[17:11:50] <plamble> if i used $(this).parent()
[17:11:59] <plamble> and wanted the match the parent+all siblings
[17:12:01] <plamble> of the parent
[17:12:05] <plamble> how would i do that
[17:12:17] <plamble> i dont want the call parents() because thats unnecessary
[17:12:36] <decx> closest to get the parent 2 layers above and then children
[17:13:10] <plamble> so $(this).parent().parent().children()
[17:13:27] <decx> just use closest
[17:14:53] <plamble> $(this).closest('div').parent().children() ?
[17:15:25] <decx> have descriptive classes then you can go up with closest as far as you want
[17:15:54] <decx> the whole point is not to be caged by markup and havng to repeat parent() just the right amount of times
[17:19:42] <robhol> I prefer my CSS classes/ids to be quite semantical. I see some people do .greenBox etc and that just makes me WTF
[17:19:47] <plamble> decx any idea whats going on here
[17:19:48] <plamble> https://jsfiddle.net/gb0puhnf/1/
[17:20:19] <decx> i thought you already toggled
[17:21:05] <taplar> block is a parent, not a sibling
[17:21:13] <taplar> to the buttons
[17:21:39] <decx> why do you repeat the button field
[17:22:22] <plamble> good point
[17:25:46] <plamble> basically instead of collecting all the 'div' elements on click which seems unnecessary in a big codebase
[17:25:58] <plamble> i'd rather just grab the parent + its siblings
[17:26:02] <plamble> https://jsfiddle.net/jqw0oqhf/12/
[17:27:34] <plamble> actually with that html
[17:27:38] <plamble> it probably is the best solution
[17:27:50] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jqw0oqhf/13/ don't need the body tag in the fiddle and you don't have to wrap to get the class name
[17:28:07] <decx> just precache
[17:28:14] <plamble> ahh, this.className
[17:32:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jqw0oqhf/16/
[17:33:39] <plamble> looks pretty clean
[17:43:53] <spoonUltra> Is there a way to incorporate transition-delay in .css?
[17:48:45] <realisation> hey there
[17:49:00] <realisation> does anyone know why $.append isn't working from the success callback of a $ajax call?
[17:49:26] <taplar> should work.  what are you trying?
[17:49:42] <shoky> prolly using the wrong `this`
[17:49:52] <taplar> and are you sure both the success is executing and the element your appending to exists?
[17:52:17] <realisation> the correct this is working
[17:52:34] <taplar> psychic shoky
[17:52:35] <realisation> and yeah, element exists. it appends when in normal scope
[17:53:37] <shoky> realisation if you're still having a problem, make a jsfiddle, show some code

[18:15:46] <robertmaxrees> someDude what is your question.
[18:18:42] <someDude> Its a trivial question, but me and a buddy were fighting about CSS3 compliance nature of JQuery...
[18:18:52] <robertmaxrees> then ask the question to the channel.
[18:22:08] <someDude> Robert Maxrees, what would you say to someone asking to use something other than JQuery, like Rails?
[18:24:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:24:56] <robertmaxrees> Rails and jQuery do 2 completely different things.
[18:25:04] <robertmaxrees> you can use both together.
[18:27:05] <badcss> can someone help me identify my problem with fullpage.js on this website? http://162.144.109.74/~allamericanlabel/
[18:27:18] <badcss> it's scrolling to the top of the page for some reason
[18:27:58] <robertmaxrees> have you tried using your console and debugger and seeing what might be causing the issue?
[18:28:14] <badcss> hi robertmaxrees
[18:28:32] <badcss> the weird thing is i had it working after i came in here on monday
[18:28:41] <badcss> and i was just playing with options and now its not working at all :(
[18:28:47] <robertmaxrees> then undo each option.
[18:29:06] <someDude> robert how does he do that
[18:29:16] <robertmaxrees> someDude do what?  use rails and jquery together?
[18:29:46] <someDude> Yeah, any references for that? That would be very helpful
[18:29:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:30:03] <robertmaxrees> they serve two completely different purposes.
[18:30:16] <robertmaxrees> the rails asset pipeline includes it iirc.
[18:30:21] <robertmaxrees> or you can use it to do that, rather.
[18:31:05] <robertmaxrees> your question is kind of like asking "how can i use wordpress and jquery together?"  one's server-side, the other is client-side, and they both do totally different jobs.
[18:31:49] <someDude> yes you are probably right
[18:33:00] <someDude> probably though... I can not say for sure, unfortunately
[18:33:05] <robertmaxrees> i can.
[18:33:11] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:35:00] <acidjazz> wat
[18:35:27] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:35:53] <someDude> i love everyone here who helps me
[18:36:31] <someDude> i mean it
[18:36:39] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[18:37:35] <someDude> especially
[18:47:26] <someDude> hey guys what's good
[18:50:29] <robertmaxrees> just another day at work.
[18:51:55] <someDude> you have a great goatee, Robert
[18:52:04] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:52:06] <robertmaxrees> thanks?
[18:53:51] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of creepy.
[18:57:40] <someDude> nah take it as a compliment, please
[18:58:28] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[19:37:33] <checkit> Hey guys... Going a lil crazy here. Using a button to dynamically add a bootstrap <abbr> tag but becuase the DOM is already loaded the element isn't inheriting the bootstrap popover. How can I fix this?
[19:39:15] <checkit> Is there a way to delegate that like a click event?
[19:40:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:40:29] <robertmaxrees> because there's no event.
[19:43:00] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Any thoughts on how I might be able to accomplish this?
[19:45:32] <robertmaxrees> you sure that involves the JS?
[19:47:27] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Well, an AJAX process is executed when the "update" feature is activated. This process queries our API and updates a list. Pieces of which are wrapped in <abbr ... popover> which isn't working.
[19:47:47] <checkit> I'm assuming it's becuase the selector is being dynamically added to the DOM and isn't "delegated".
[19:49:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not the right term for that ;)
[19:49:49] <robertmaxrees> you can't delegate initialization - that's not really an event.
[19:50:30] <checkit> robertmaxrees: I am admittedly ignorant on the subject. Was hoping I'd get the missing direction here.
[19:50:48] <robertmaxrees> either way, http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips-examples
[19:50:53] <robertmaxrees> see the "Opt-in functionality"?
[19:52:00] <checkit> robertmaxrees: I've already opted-in. When the page is rendered and the DOM intialized the already existing popovers are functional. It's the ones I'm dynamically adding later that are not.
[19:52:11] <robertmaxrees> right, you have to re-run that after you load them in.
[19:52:57] <robertmaxrees> you just do it after you append that content.
[19:53:46] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Oh. Okay.
[20:24:42] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeee
[20:25:16] <Sal> can someone help me finish this: http://jsbin.com/miqaculopi/edit?js,output
[20:25:26] <robertmaxrees> what do you need?
[20:25:36] <Sal> need to let one dropdown close when i click on the other menu button
[20:25:42] <Sal> now it opens both
[20:25:55] <Sal> and also, i would like to apply some nice
[20:25:55] <robertmaxrees> also: terrible variable naming.
[20:26:06] <Sal> opening effect, but don't know nothing about them
[20:26:18] <Sal> robertmaxrees, its only a testing file
[20:26:24] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[20:26:29] <robertmaxrees> it's almost unreadable.
[20:26:30] <Sal> i'm not using that naming in real file
[20:29:30] <robertmaxrees> either way, that's easy - close all the dropdowns and then open the open you want.
[20:29:45] <robertmaxrees> also: your'e missing var declarations.
[20:30:02] <Sal> robertmaxrees, i told ya, its only quick testing code
[20:30:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:30:28] <robertmaxrees> why would you write invalid JS?
[20:30:33] <robertmaxrees> why not just write a valid POC?
[20:31:08] <Sal> i'm not gonna use hungarian notation or camel case in a playground
[20:31:16] <robertmaxrees> that's... not what i'm suggesting.
[20:31:26] <Sal> just need to put down things quicly to see if my idea is right otr not
[20:31:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm suggesting you use clear var names and write valid code.
[20:31:28] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[20:31:35] <Sal> ok
[20:31:51] <robertmaxrees> you can just hide all dropdowns when you click on one.
[20:46:36] <robertpaulson> can someone help me with this: https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/ea82ffd9be8db285e0b5 ? I am trying to query a dictionary api using json. The problem is the dictionary only has a 'meaning' field randomly in the object.
[20:46:53] <robertmaxrees> why is that a problem?
[20:47:01] <robertpaulson> I want to grab the meaning' but sometimes the 0th element doesn't have a value
[20:47:19] <robertpaulson> I am using something like this: $('#chineseToEnglishDefinitions').append("<p class='spacing'>"+data['tuc'][i]['meanings'][0]['text']+"</p>");
[20:47:24] <robertmaxrees> noooo.
[20:47:38] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[20:48:16] <robertpaulson> also if you look at my code I have a counter... the counter is wrong because I am counting tuc.length which is five.... However within that 5, only 3 have meanings. So I actually want to be able to call something like tuc.meanings.length
[20:48:48] <robertpaulson> This is the query I had a problem with: https://glosbe.com/gapi_v0_1/translate?from=eng&dest=zh&format=json&phrase=quest
[20:48:55] <robertmaxrees> back waaaaay up :)
[20:49:34] <robertpaulson> sorry, im wrong in my naming. I want the chinese, for example: ['tuc'][2]['phrase']['text']
[20:49:50] <robertmaxrees> so it looks like you want to append all phrases on one side and all meanings on the other.
[20:49:51] <robertmaxrees> right?
[20:51:21] <robertpaulson> not quite, the problem with this code (['tuc'][2]['phrase']['text']) is that if you look at this json: https://glosbe.com/gapi_v0_1/translate?from=eng&dest=zh&format=json&phrase=quest . there are 5 'tucs' but only 3 'text'
[20:51:24] <robertmaxrees> and i'd guess you'd only want a phrase if it has a related meaning.
[20:51:57] <robertpaulson> My counter is this though: var counter = data['tuc'].length; which is = 5
[20:52:02] <robertmaxrees> ignopre the counter.
[20:52:07] <robertmaxrees> we're going to get rid of the for loop.
[20:52:37] <robertpaulson> I basically just want each phrase.text on the page
[20:52:44] <robertpaulson> and am not sure how to target them
[20:52:51] <robertmaxrees> you wantto use a .map() here.
[20:53:08] <robertpaulson> okay let me look into that
[20:53:13] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[20:53:15] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you.
[20:55:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jy8gaL3v/1/
[20:56:05] <robertmaxrees> you want to map and filter down to the dataset you want.
[20:59:33] <robertmaxrees> robertpaulson does that make sense?
[21:01:00] <robertpaulson> Im still looking at it
[21:01:19] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[21:01:25] <robertpaulson> sorry hahah
[21:14:40] <robertpaulson> can i make data = the json url?
[21:14:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[21:15:03] <robertpaulson> nm
[21:15:08] <robertmaxrees> you stick that code in the callback.
[21:25:38] <robertpaulson>  https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/8f97f823614722f98d38
[21:26:51] <robertpaulson> nevermind
[21:27:12] <robertpaulson> i got it
[21:27:14] <robertpaulson> I think
[21:27:29] <robertpaulson> @robertmaxrees  thanks!
