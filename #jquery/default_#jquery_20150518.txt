[00:12:14] <Uhkis> NikoZz: nothing is triggered there
[00:14:29] <Macaveli> I have the following HTML CODE is it possible to place text before the small tag? <label for="personal_info[ZINSS_NUMBER]">Numéro NISS <small>(Ex. 90092313364)</small></label>
[00:21:42] <socialblogsite> can i declare a mouseeleave INSIDE a mouseenter? or would that overload the memory with unnecessary events?
[00:36:36] <MeiR`> Macaveli, use .before(). here's a fiddle i made: http://jsfiddle.net/t90mfvfh/
[00:36:54] <Macaveli> I have done it with insertBefore
[00:37:03] <phpius> hello I get this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of null
[00:37:12] <phpius> on this line: var elementId = elementName.match(/\d+$/)[0];
[00:37:16] <lilalinuxKL> phpius: then your array doesn;'t exist
[00:37:19] <phpius> what should I be doing to avoid that error?
[00:37:45] <phpius> lilalinuxKL - i know why it is happening, but how can I intercept the error?
[00:37:54] <phpius> like if (error) { // do something }
[00:38:00] <lilalinuxKL> you are serching for an element with name dddddddd?
[00:38:13] <phpius> no, anything with a number
[00:38:18] <lilalinuxKL> that ends with one or multple ds?
[00:38:41] <lilalinuxKL> try [0-9]+
[00:38:43] <MeiR`> socialblogsite, "mouseleave" inside a "mouseenter" will lead to many attached events
[00:39:02] <lilalinuxKL> I never use shortcuts
[00:39:17] <phpius> lilalinuxKL, no - it just ends in a number
[00:39:20] <MeiR`> socialblogsite, maybe you can cosider using .hover
[00:39:30] <phpius> so it might be like... "xxphoto124"
[00:39:30] <lilalinuxKL> phpius: [0-9]+$
[00:40:00] <MeiR`> socialblogsite: https://api.jquery.com/hover/ - Description: Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements.
[00:40:04] <phpius> i don't think it's the regex thats the problem, it's just if - i don't provide a photo for that particular element
[00:40:06] <phpius> then it's empty
[00:40:08] <lilalinuxKL> store the array in a var and check it's existence before indexing it
[00:40:10] <phpius> then I get the error
[00:40:28] <phpius> var arr =  elementName.match(/\d+$/); ?
[00:40:34] <phpius> then if (arr.length > 0) ?
[00:40:44] <lilalinuxKL> TIAS
[00:41:10] <phpius> tias?
[00:41:18] <Woet> try it and see.
[00:41:23] <lilalinuxKL> :-)
[00:42:06] <phpius> ok
[00:43:48] <MeiR`> phpius, it's probably because elementName is empty before running "match()"
[00:44:11] <MeiR`> a simple if will solve it
[00:44:24] <socialblogsite> MeiR`: I DID use .hover, and used a .filter to prevent the mouseleave to trigger on the element that has not been hovered yet. Not elegant, but can you think of another idea? (i want to run the mouseleave ONLY IF the element has been hovered (I know, it sounds unprobable, but I wanted to avoid errors if the user switches windows or the pointer goes to another app…. Option B was using a global to keep track of the mouseenter. Im I too paranoic? or
[00:44:25] <phpius> MeiR`: if this one I'm trying now doesn't work I'll try checking elementName too
[00:44:25] <socialblogsite> are there cases where the mouseleave fires without a mouseenter?
[00:45:02] <MeiR`> socialblogsite, can you create a fiddle?
[00:45:07] <socialblogsite> MeiR`: but you answered my quesion above. thanks :)
[00:47:07] <lilalinuxKL> phpius: why don't you use ids or classes and jquery selectors?
[00:47:58] <socialblogsite> MeiR`: can you help me with my previous quesion? : Is it possible to add some data to the jQuery collection so I can store/retrieve some variable WITHOUT checking the DOM? (to be used on every frame painting) Or is is faster to add/retrieve data in the DOM?
[00:48:54] <MeiR`> socialblogsite, of course you can store it
[00:49:02] <MeiR`> assuming the content shouldn't be dynamic
[00:49:05] <socialblogsite> (I don’t want to “ask” the DOM if the elements defined initially still apply to keep being processed in every frame)
[00:49:20] <MeiR`> a testcase will help
[00:50:59] <phpius> lilalinuxKL - need to be able to dynamically get all fields ending with an ID number
[00:51:08] <phpius> MeiR` you're right, elementName was null
[00:51:41] <lilalinuxKL> phpius: use classes and multiple classes
[00:52:09] <phpius> i would if i was doing it again
[00:52:15] <lilalinuxKL> i see
[00:52:16] <phpius> i've learned quite a bit from this project
[00:52:43] <lilalinuxKL> phpius: are you using .ready()?
[00:52:49] <socialblogsite> MeiR`: I’m not an advanced programmer. Cleaning up the code and creating a test case would take me a lot of time. Sorry. Basicall I want to run a foreach() in which I’ll FLAG some elements for THE SAME foreach() processes less elements every time they were already “flagged” (e.g. gone from visible area of screen), and I DON’T WANT to check their position or anything from the DOM, so since I can’t modify the set/collection on the fly (I
[00:52:50] <socialblogsite> was told the idex numbers won’t match and everything will break), at least I can “flag” them so even though they’ll still paass through the foreach(), most of the calculations will be skipped :)
[00:53:03] <lilalinuxKL> phpius: or .load()?
[00:53:03] <phpius> jquery? yes
[00:53:12] <phpius> document ready
[00:53:17] <lilalinuxKL> no, i mean if you check if the document finished loading
[00:53:26] <lilalinuxKL> before running your JS
[00:53:35] <phpius> i do not understand
[00:54:25] <MeiR`> socialblogsite, why should you run multiple loops? should elements change each time?
[00:54:32] <lilalinuxKL> https://api.jquery.com/ready/ https://api.jquery.com/load
[00:55:00] <lilalinuxKL> forget the load
[00:55:04] <lilalinuxKL> I meant the ready()
[00:55:20] <socialblogsite> MeiR`: onScroll. Many frames, many objects. I don’t want to “ask” the DOM every time for all of them, UNLESS asking the DOM is faster than storing a variable in the collection.
[00:55:46] <phpius> i use document ready, yes
[00:56:06] <MeiR`> socialblogsite, i don't think some can answer this kind of question in general
[00:56:10] <MeiR`> someone*
[00:56:19] <MeiR`> it's individual manner
[00:57:03] <socialblogsite> MeiR`:I was not asking. You asked me why. I’m telling you why. You already answered me. I can store variables in the collection :)
[00:57:13] <MeiR`> socialblogsite, by the way, when you say "frames", do you mean actual window frames?
[00:57:31] <socialblogsite> MeiR`: painting frames. (as in framerate)
[00:57:37] <socialblogsite> steps?
[00:58:36] <socialblogsite> I assume storing variables in the collection itself is straighforward, and faster than checking the DOM.
[01:00:33] <socialblogsite> MeiR`: My original idea was in each() step, to REMOVE the item from the collection each() is running on :P but I was told it would break everything, so “flagging” which items not to process next time is the way to go :)
[01:19:03] <rachelfish> Hiya #jquery !
[01:19:15] <rachelfish> Why does jQuery use jQuery.fn instead of jQuery.prototype directly?
[01:21:20] <Cork> heh good question
[01:21:43] <Cork> number of characters i suspect (as it is just two names on the same property)
[01:22:11] <Uhkis> write less, do more ;) :D
[01:22:57] <Cork> from the code: jQuery.fn = jQuery.prototype = {
[01:23:12] <Cork> so it is just a synonym of the same exact object
[01:33:20] <rachelfish> Cork: Right, that's why I was asking
[01:33:33] <rachelfish> I was wondering if there was some technical reason for it other than saving a few characters
[01:33:53] <Cork> nope
[01:33:57] <rachelfish> Maybe some developers are afraid of .prototype so they decided to use .fn instead ;)
[01:34:06] <Cork> cause it is actually using the prototype directly
[01:39:16] <Kartagis> Cork: remember my issue with CORS stuff?
[02:03:34] <Justus> hi, I'm using $.ajax with type: "script", the success function is only called after the script is actually run, is it possible to get in before it is run?
[02:03:49] <Justus> *dataType of course
[02:04:23] <joni_> hi
[02:04:35] <joni_> I have a question in jquery
[02:04:39] <joni_> and need some help in that
[02:04:49] <joni_> I have this site shine9.us/wp and want the main navbar to be like this travelsofadam.com mean the main navbar should be sticky when scroll down the page
[02:05:01] <joni_> I  am using bootstrap framework
[02:05:07] <joni_> I have applied this method http://stanhub.com/scroll-to-top-then-fixed-navigation-effect-with-jquery-and-css-free-download/ but don't feel any changes on my site shine9.us/wp
[02:05:19] <joni_> any help will be appreciated.
[02:05:52] <Justus> joni_: more of a css problem really, try #boostrap or #css
[02:05:57] <Justus> sorry, #bootstrap
[02:06:12] <Cork> Justus: you could just type text and then use jQuery.globalEval
[02:06:16] <joni_> is it not a jquery issue ?
[02:06:28] <joni_> I have tried #bootstrap but no response there
[02:06:29] <joni_> :(
[02:06:48] <joni_> also try #javascript but no response there
[02:06:51] <Cork> joni_: then you're best option is to ask again
[02:06:57] <Cork> (in the correct channel)
[02:07:15] <joni_> Cork. in #jquery ?
[02:07:19] <Cork> also try ##twitter-bootstrap and ##bootstrap
[02:07:32] <Cork> joni_: if it isn't a jquery question, then no
[02:07:49] <Justus> Cork: hm, I guess going a bit more explicit there won't hurt.
[02:08:00] <joni_> I think this is javascript/jquery question <script>    $(document).ready(function(){ 	   $(window).bind('scroll', function() { 	   var navHeight = $( window ).height() - 70; 			 if ($(window).scrollTop() > navHeight) { 				 $('nav').addClass('fixed'); 			 } 			 else { 				 $('nav').removeClass('fixed'); 			 } 		}); 	}); </script>
[02:08:07] <joni_> or not ?
[02:08:24] <Cork> 1. don't dump code in the channel
[02:08:35] <Cork> 2. if you have a jquery question ask it
[02:08:38] <Kartagis> Justus: your nick reminds me of that particular CSI:Cyber episode :)
[02:08:42] <Cork> currently you've just asked about bootstrap
[02:09:12] <Justus> Kartagis: that's actually not my nickname, just my parents having premonitions :D
[02:09:27] <Cork> Justus: the callback for script is meant to be after the script has been evaluated
[02:09:37] <Cork> as it is meant to be "you can now use function x"
[02:09:55] <Kartagis> I don't know what that means. "premonition"?
[02:11:12] <Justus> Kartagis: they have picked a matching name for my personality ;)
[02:11:22] <Kartagis> okay
[02:13:02] <Koopz> anyone using holder.js?
[02:14:27] <Koopz> i've got a Datatables using an ajax-datasource and the placeholder images won't load because they're being loaded after the page loading has finished
[02:17:25] <Koopz> ahh... there's a method i can call manually
[02:20:09] <krambiorix> hi, i'm in search of how i can remove a dropzonejs from an element. In the code i found Dropzone.prototype.destroy = function(){......}  -> how can i call this function?
[02:44:26] <prillian5> Have i to load jquery-mobile only for mobile-resoulution, or can I also use it for webpages on desktop?
[02:46:30] <Koopz> krambiorix, you should be able to $('#dropzone').destroy();
[02:49:33] <Koopz> otherwise maybe $('#dropzone').dropzone('destroy'); might do the trick.
[03:04:04] <Justus> Cork: your suggestion works like a charm, thank you :)
[03:05:52] <Whirled> hey all. can I extend the jquery object to create my own object that includes my methods and jquery methods?
[03:06:15] <Justus> you mean like an extension?
[03:06:28] <Whirled> var x=$.extend($,function () {});  ?
[03:07:47] <Justus> Whirled: https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/ take a look
[03:08:24] <kokut> Hello, i have a plugin in my website that handles the menu, is there a way to add a listener or something to tell when its the sticky being triggered?
[03:08:37] <Whirled> thanks. Written a couple of plugins, I am trying to avoid polluting the jquery namespace while adding methods that I use over and over. Guess I'll just use .clone()
[03:08:41] <kokut> or i have to make a custom one myself listening on scroll and the element postion fixed
[03:09:34] <Justus> Whirled: I still can't really grasp your use case
[03:09:49] <Justus> kokut: not unless that plugin has that option
[03:10:06] <Justus> kokut: if it doesn't you can perhaps tweak it a bit
[03:10:13] <Cork> Whirled: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/
[03:10:31] <kokut> Justus: so ill have to add a listener on scroll and every time it gets triggered to check if the element is fixed... ?
[03:11:03] <Justus> kokut: I don't know what plugin you are using so your guess is probably better than mine
[03:13:47] <Whirled> Thanks Cork. .sub is deprecated for 2.1?
[03:15:18] <arup_r> Why my Jquery is not ading the active class to the <li> ? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/a01a230cde1acb67d263
[03:15:35] <arup_r> https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/a01a230cde1acb67d263#file-profile-js-L10
[03:18:40] <dimi1947> I have a problem with backbone....is is considered a javscript problem with the broader sense of the term
[03:19:07] <dimi1947> anyone willing to help?
[03:20:25] <xqo> what is an efficient way to check if an object has one of many values? http://jsfiddle.net/8jruxmgh/
[03:20:35] <Whirled> arup_r try $("#profile-nav-link ul li a").on("click", function (e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).parent().addClass("active");});
[03:20:43] <xqo> what is an efficient way to check if an object has one of many keys*? http://jsfiddle.net/8jruxmgh/
[03:21:54] <arup_r> why Whirled: you removed `>` one?
[03:23:31] <arup_r> Whirled: worked..
[03:23:55] <arup_r> One more thing.. I need to remove the other <li> active classes..
[03:24:04] <arup_r> any one out of 4 can be active..
[03:24:35] <arup_r> idea ?
[03:27:30] <Whirled> xqo, you mean like this?
[03:27:31] <Whirled> http://jsfiddle.net/8jruxmgh/1/
[03:28:31] <Whirled> $(this).closest("ul").find("li").removeClass('active'); $(this).parent().addClass("active");
[03:28:33] <davetarmac> I can't seem to get this working in IE11/Firefox http://pastebin.com/BwFiaEbJ
[03:29:00] <davetarmac> I know it's to do with the is(':hover') but can't find a workaround that will work as I wanted
[03:29:07] <davetarmac> I tried to add a timeout, but no joy
[03:29:47] <Cork> davetarmac: binding event handlers inside event handlers is normally a bad idea
[03:29:50] <arup_r> Whirled: yes.. It seems so
[03:30:12] <Cork> davetarmac: also what type of element is #header-account?
[03:30:44] <Cork> Whirled: ouch, its removed in 1.9
[03:30:47] <Cork> and yes 2.1
[03:30:52] <Cork> totally missed that
[03:30:56] <arup_r> Whirled: thanks
[03:31:00] <Whirled> np. Loved the idea though.;
[03:31:22] <arup_r> thanks.. :) I'll come again
[03:31:56] <Cork> Whirled: https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-sub-removed
[03:32:06] <Cork> Whirled: you could grab the feature from the migrate plugin
[03:34:02] <Whirled> Cork, do you have a collection of jquery methods that you just automatically add to most projects?
[03:34:30] <Cork> Whirled: ya, but not many
[03:35:23] <Whirled> seems like I am always rewriting the standard drag-to-inertia class for animating jquery objects.
[03:35:42] <Cork> ah, i basically only do animations in css now days
[03:35:53] <Cork> animations isn't important enough to need a fallback
[03:36:02] <Whirled> css doesn't account for momentum, though
[03:36:08] <davetarmac> Cork: it's a div
[03:36:20] <Cork> davetarmac: have you set tabindex on the div?
[03:36:36] <Whirled> acceleration and deceleration are the problem.
[03:36:39] <davetarmac> don't remember seeing one (I picked up someone elses code)
[03:36:39] <Cork> oh wait... :hover...
[03:36:44] <davetarmac> yeah
[03:36:57] <Cork> davetarmac: ya, ignore that
[03:37:08] <davetarmac> Cork: the popular workaround online was to add a timeout, but that didn't seem to place nice either
[03:37:35] <Cork> davetarmac: what i would do is add a separate hover handler on #header-account
[03:37:49] <Cork> and in that event add a .hover class on the element
[03:37:53] <Cork> then just check for that class
[03:38:02] <Whirled> davetarmac, just add the "myjhover" class....nvm cork beat me
[03:38:20] <arup_r> Whirled: class are added properly.. but click in not taking me to the correct link.. it remains in the same page..
[03:38:36] <Whirled> arup_r, that's the preventDefault();
[03:39:20] <Whirled> remove the e.preventDefault(); to allow the anchor elements to work
[03:39:29] <arup_r> Ok.. then what should I do ?
[03:39:36] <arup_r> After adding class.. it should go the mentioned `href`
[03:40:11] <davetarmac> oh right
[03:40:25] <Whirled> if your href= a new url, it won't matter which class you add, it won't be there on the new page load
[03:40:45] <davetarmac> Is there no way to just modify that code to make it work? or is that a who can of pain?
[03:41:01] <arup_r> if I remove the prevent default.. then url click is taking me to the correct page.. but the active class is not working..
[03:41:04] <arup_r> Whirled:
[03:41:14] <Cork> davetarmac: the change should be small enough
[03:41:50] <Whirled> arup_r, that's because you are loading a new page. If you want a new page, you will have to set it up to show the menu the way it should be for that page...add it to the html.
[03:42:26] <Whirled> when you load a new page, it starts from scratch. Nothing you did in the last page matters to the new page.
[03:42:48] <Cork> davetarmac: something like this should do it http://pastebin.com/SjbY5XNq
[03:43:22] <arup_r> Whirled: humm got your point..
[03:43:22] <Whirled> arup_r, what you could do is have the menu builder parse the current url to determine which class to make active.
[03:43:29] <arup_r> I hv no idea how to do so..
[03:43:54] <davetarmac> Cork: oh - I see what you meant
[03:44:04] <arup_r> hunmm... cool idea.. how to do so
[03:44:09] <Whirled> You could pass query variable that you could parse on the other end
[03:44:13] <davetarmac> yeah, I feel dumb for asking now
[03:44:55] <arup_r> actually I have a shared partial.. which is being used by 4 pages.. and once clicked an link a new page is loading the with partial again getting loaded.. so DOM getting changed...
[03:45:02] <arup_r> Whirled: You are right..
[03:45:07] <davetarmac> nw i just need to adjust that to include my check for the currently hovered item
[03:45:08] <arup_r> Nedd to get around of it.
[03:45:13] <Whirled> add "href='/mysection/newpage.html?menu=4'" to your link element
[03:45:52] <Whirled> then when the page loads, you build the menu and check your query variable. If it's 1, add it to the first class..etc. etc.
[03:46:10] <prillian5> why the return-value of the function is allways undefined?  http://jsfiddle.net/suther/1gnhgLzm/
[03:46:37] <prillian5> how can i got the scope of vars inside of .on(function(){}) ?
[03:47:12] <Whirled> arup_r try this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values-in-javascript
[03:47:23] <arup_r> got what U said
[03:50:27] <arup_r> Whirled: so should I use page load event?
[03:50:45] <Whirled> Yes.
[03:51:04] <Whirled> arup_r, I gotta run. I'll check back in a while. Good luck.
[03:51:10] <arup_r> ok
[03:55:48] <prillian5> what is the best way to encapsulate this : http://jsfiddle.net/suther/1gnhgLzm/1/ in a function, to be able to send '#xst_carousel-1' as parameter ?
[03:57:54] <Cork> prillian5: http://jsfiddle.net/1gnhgLzm/2/
[03:58:26] <prillian5> Cork: thank you. I try this
[03:58:52] <Cork> prillian5: another option could be to use delegation instead
[03:59:10] <Cork> (and skipping the function all together)
[03:59:30] <prillian5> what you mean with "delegation"?
[03:59:36] <DarsVaeda> I need to disable some days in the datepicker, that works when the month is changed because I get month and year then, can I do this on the initial call?
[04:00:00] <DarsVaeda> I can't seem to find an option for this
[04:01:31] <shoky> DarsVaeda you can use the "beforeShowDay" callback
[04:01:53] <Cork> ?api delegate
[04:01:53] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:01:59] <Cork> prillian5: read that page
[04:02:30] <DarsVaeda> shoky, I need something before that to get all dates I need to disable
[04:03:08] <shoky> DarsVaeda: why
[04:03:20] <shoky> and, what's the problem
[04:03:23] <DarsVaeda> I don't want to get all dates for the whole year?
[04:03:33] <shoky> i don't understand
[04:04:09] <DarsVaeda> what part?
[04:04:22] <shoky> what's wrong with my suggestion ;p
[04:04:56] <DarsVaeda> that would fetch dates to disable for every day of the displayed month
[04:05:08] <DarsVaeda> I'd like to do it once per month only
[04:05:31] <shoky> but you need to specify the options for each day
[04:05:42] <shoky> you said yourself you want to "disable some days"
[04:05:50] <shoky> what better way than a callback per day
[04:06:11] <DarsVaeda> thats two things
[04:06:23] <DarsVaeda> getting the data which days to disable and disable the days
[04:07:20] <shoky> nobody said you have to be "getting the data" multiple times.. i still don't understand what you're doing
[04:08:06] <DarsVaeda> to disable dates you need to know whiches ones, right?
[04:08:30] <shoky> yes
[04:09:48] <DarsVaeda> do you want to fetch that data for every day?
[04:09:53] <DarsVaeda> surely not :)
[04:10:22] <shoky> who said you have to fetch it more than once?
[04:10:46] <DarsVaeda> okay thanks for your help
[04:13:44] <shoky> DarsVaeda: http://jsfiddle.net/ztYAG/14/  data is only "fetched" once, on load.
[04:15:59] <ilhami> does jQuery functions take care of XSS? :P
[04:16:25] <shoky> in general? no
[04:16:29] <DarsVaeda> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/ztYAG/15/ really?
[04:16:51] <ilhami> shoky, how to escape output then?
[04:16:55] <shoky> DarsVaeda: line #1 is only run once, on load. then the data is fetched, forever
[04:17:40] <DarsVaeda> as I said I don't want to fetch ALL the data
[04:17:41] <shoky> ilhami: with a good templating library/framework.  or you can use jquery's .text()
[04:17:44] <DarsVaeda> that would be nonsense
[04:18:08] <shoky> DarsVaeda: it's up to you what to fetch and when to fetch it. that has nothing to do with the datepicker or its callbacks.
[04:18:50] <DarsVaeda> I beg to differ
[04:19:11] <ilhami> shoky, so I can use twig with jQuery? :D
[04:19:11] <shoky> differ away
[04:19:25] <shoky> ilhami: i dunno twig. why not ;p
[04:21:22] <ilhami> Problem is that I generate some of the html from jQuery. I know this isn't the best practice. :P
[04:29:14] <arup_r> If I click on links ... console log is not showing anyvalue.. Only If I do page refresh that I am seeing console output.. https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/60972248ac0acd100b96
[04:29:36] <arup_r> I want after click on link.. when the page load will be done.. then the JS to be executed
[04:31:48] <shoky> arup_r: then you want a click event handler
[04:32:20] <arup_r> But.. I want to inspect the value of menu after the page load in fnished
[04:32:27] <arup_r> **is
[04:32:51] <arup_r> click event is getting lost when the new page is loaded..
[04:33:14] <shoky> do you want a new page to load? or not
[04:34:26] <arup_r> new page load.. then I will inspect shoky:
[04:36:03] <shoky> can't understand you. if you want a new page to load, then a click handler doesn't help with much. if you don't want a new page to load, you can call event.preventDefault()  in the click handler, where event is the argument passed in to the handler
[04:39:29] <MajorTennis> has anyone ever had any luck applying perfect scrollbar to a table body?
[04:39:57] <arup_r> shoky: you can see the 4 links.. right.. Now after click to the any links of those.. a new page will be loaded.. after page load I want to check the menu attr value.. and then I'll add the a class to the corresponding <li> of the anchor whose `menu`  attribute is not empty strng...
[04:39:59] <Whirled> arup_r, the concept is that on page load, the URL remains whatever you set it to when it was loaded
[04:40:18] <Whirled> so add a query variable to the href to determine which menu item you loaded
[04:40:28] <arup_r> Whirled: no each link click is hitting a new url..
[04:40:40] <arup_r> and I am seeing the url in the browser
[04:41:02] <Whirled> <a href='./my_menu/somenewfile.html?menuitem=3' >click here to open to menu 3</a>
[04:41:42] <Whirled> the new url is fine so long as your menu builder looks for the menuitem query variable like the link I showed you.
[04:44:54] <arup_r> ok.. with your thought.. How the Jquery should look like ?
[04:47:36] <BarnaSzalai> hi
[04:48:02] <BarnaSzalai> can you help me what is the currenct selected item in chrome dev tools?
[04:48:08] <BarnaSzalai> how to reference it?
[04:49:05] <shoky> BarnaSzalai: currently selected element is $0 in console
[04:49:11] <BarnaSzalai> ah thanks
[04:49:15] <BarnaSzalai> shoky:
[04:50:45] <kokut> hello, i need to check the src attribute of an image, how can i do that? if (selector).attr(src, url) === 'myurl' ?
[04:51:41] <BarnaSzalai> .attr('src')
[04:52:23] <kokut> k
[04:55:40] <Whirled> arup_r, here is the general concept. It's not perfect and jsfiddle isn't the best to test it in, but it gives you the idea:http://jsfiddle.net/av1v2Ler/3/
[04:56:48] <Whirled> you can make the menu select any urls you want, just make sure that you add the query variable indicating which url is being requested so you can parse it when you build the menu
[04:59:54] <arup_r> Whirled: You are right.. by theory.. it seems Rails is causing the issue
[05:00:28] <Whirled> lol. rails? What do you mean?
[05:00:44] <Cork> arup_r: are the page loads on the page site?
[05:00:58] <Cork> if they are you could use ajax to get around the problem
[05:00:58] <arup_r> Cork: Yes
[05:01:10] <Whirled> bbq
[05:01:35] <Cork> basically do ajax calls for the partial of the content instead of the full page (i would recommend json)
[05:01:41] <Cork> and then leave the menu untouched
[05:01:55] <Cork> then you can set the state of the menu without losing it
[05:02:12] <Cork> (then you update the url with history.pushState)
[05:05:49] <IamTrying> Why its not working? window.parent.$('#iframe_display_modules').trigger('click');
[05:06:04] <Justus> several reasons
[05:06:15] <Justus> can you put the actual code you have anywhere?
[05:06:31] <Cork> IamTrying: you would have to define "not working"
[05:06:46] <Cork> what are you expecting to happen
[05:06:53] <Justus> I can tell 3 very likely scenarios even without the code :D
[05:07:27] <Justus> this shouts xss violation very intensely :D
[05:07:37] <Cork> not really
[05:07:45] <Cork> if the page is from the same domain it works just fine
[05:07:47] <IamTrying> http://paste.ubuntu.com/11205165/ - Justus
[05:08:13] <IamTrying> Cork: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11205165/  , main.php is loading the splummens_1.php in iframe
[05:08:30] <IamTrying> now from main.php button_5b1_scan() has to send a click to the iframe which is not working
[05:08:50] <Cork> IamTrying: are you trying to fire a click event handler
[05:08:51] <Justus> the html of both the page and the subpage you are loading are kinda important here
[05:08:55] <Cork> or what is the click meant to do?
[05:09:03] <IamTrying> EXactly Cork, fire a clit event handler
[05:09:26] <Cork> IamTrying: and console.log(window.parent.$('#iframe_display_modules').length) is?
[05:09:33] <Cork> (in the method handler)
[05:09:48] <IamTrying> Cork: Click if received in the splummens_1.php body then it will scan a camera and take snap-shot.
[05:09:49] <Cork> "button_5b1_scan" that is
[05:10:01] <IamTrying> let me check
[05:10:17] <Cork> IamTrying: sounds like you need a priviliged event
[05:10:21] <Cork> and you can't fake those
[05:11:25] <IamTrying> console.log(window.parent.$('#iframe_display_modules').length) = 1 @ Cork
[05:11:53] <Cork> ok and are you trying to use the navigator api for taking cam shots?
[05:12:37] <IamTrying> Cork: splummens_1.php is WebRTC webcam
[05:13:09] <Cork> i take that as a yes
[05:13:14] <IamTrying> OK
[05:13:26] <Cork> i don't think you can do that from a fake click event
[05:14:33] <IamTrying> Cork:  Then i have to do a very hard way: http://jsfiddle.net/6FZkk/1/
[05:14:58] <IamTrying> main.php and splummens_1.php is in same domain, same https
[05:15:09] <IamTrying> main.php need to send click to splummens_1.php
[05:15:17] <IamTrying> if not possible then i have to do this with this: http://jsfiddle.net/6FZkk/1/
[05:18:01] <arup_r> Cork: and Whirled: got help from https://www.stormconsultancy.co.uk/blog/development/code-snippets/jquery-document-ready-events-and-turbolinks/
[05:19:00] <Cork> IamTrying: looking around in that lib i'm not sure it does what i first though actually
[05:19:11] <Cork> IamTrying: is the click event fired at all?
[05:19:28] <Cork> (have you checked if ti fires or just "it doesn't grab the image"?)
[05:20:24] <IamTrying> Cork: if i apply $('#iframe_display_modules').trigger('click');  will it trigger click inside the iframe for <body onclick=HERE??>
[05:20:35] <IamTrying> just to make sure if it really receives the click
[05:20:50] <Cork> IamTrying: no the click fires on the iframe element
[05:21:05] <Cork> and that might actually be the problem
[05:21:10] <IamTrying> Ah!! then there will be no way to receive it in <body...>
[05:21:14] <Cork> cause iframes normally don't fire click events
[05:21:35] <Cork> IamTrying: you mean the body inside the iframe?
[05:21:40] <IamTrying> OK - then i have to use NodeJS thanks Cork.
[05:21:46] <IamTrying> YES - body inside the iframe Cork
[05:21:55] <Cork> then you would have to fire the event in THAT document
[05:21:59] <Cork> not the parent document
[05:22:07] <IamTrying> how do you do that please? Cork
[05:22:17] <IamTrying> fire the event in that document i mean
[05:22:32] <Cork> window.parent.$('body', document).trigger('click')
[05:22:35] <Cork> might work
[05:22:39] <IamTrying> Let me test
[05:22:47] <Cork> i haven't done much cross document fiddling with jquery
[05:23:14] <arup_r> Cork: and Whirled: here is the working code: https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/60972248ac0acd100b96#file-profile-js
[05:23:20] <kokut> say i replace the src attribute of an image in some event, how can i add some animation to that?
[05:23:41] <Cork> kokut: you can't
[05:23:51] <Cork> an img tag can only hold one image at a time
[05:24:11] <Cork> if you want transition (before css4) you have to use separate elements
[05:25:22] <samssh> I thought we decided CSS4 was a misnomer.
[05:25:49] <Cork> not according to the csswg at least
[05:26:59] <Cork> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-cascade-4/
[05:27:17] <Cork> "Draft 25 March 2015"
[05:27:52] <samssh> Hrmm. I guess I was thinking CSS4 had gone the way of "HTML6"
[05:28:01] <Cork> nope
[05:28:10] <Cork> they've split css3+ up into modules
[05:28:15] <Cork> so they land in parts
[05:28:22] <Cork> but they do still have css3 and css4
[05:29:36] <Cork> that said, css3 isn't even complete yet so css4 is quite a bit out
[05:30:26] <samssh> Cork, I would give a lot to have :has() support now.
[05:31:05] <samssh> Like, at least all the money in my wallet. Like $23.
[05:31:08] <IamTrying> Cork: did not worked do you put this in splummens_1.php or in main.php? window.parent.$('body', document).trigger('click')
[05:31:42] <IamTrying> splummens_1.php need to get click from main.php. here main.php > iframe src=splummens_1.php
[05:32:36] <Cork> samssh: to 99.999999% certainty, that won't ever land
[05:32:50] <Whirled> kokut, you could load the image without attaching it to the dom, then animate the old image replace the src attribute and animate it back. But'd I'd just use a second img and hide one, show the other.
[05:33:16] <Cork> samssh: that requires browsers to select backwards and that basically means do complete style matching an additional time
[05:33:56] <kokut> Whirled: thats how it is now
[05:34:03] <Cork> samssh: every time that's been proposed in the www-style mailing list it's been shot down with "can't be done without huge performance loss for all page renders"
[05:34:06] <kokut> i'm replacing the image and i want to add some animation/effect
[05:34:30] <Cork> so don't hold you're breath on ever seeing it land :)
[05:35:16] <Whirled> so load the image into a hidden <img> element and animate each on load complete.
[05:35:26] <Cork> IamTrying: well as it uses window.parent it requires to be in the child document
[05:35:26] <ndimatteo> hey all, I’m using the jquery-rss plugin and it keeps skipping the first post of a wordpress RSS feed, you can see this issue in action here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VLaoar
[05:35:29] <samssh> Cork, I'm going to be optimistic. There are a lot of styling situations where it would make the task much easier.
[05:35:48] <ndimatteo> if anyone can offer some insight I’d be so grateful, this client is freaking out.
[05:35:50] <Cork> samssh: ya, but it isn't too hard to work around
[05:36:08] <Kartagis> how do I check the status with ajax?
[05:36:15] <Kartagis> status code*
[05:36:20] <Cork> samssh: and it seriously isn't possible in renger engines
[05:36:39] <Cork> Kartagis: second option to the done callback if i remember correctly
[05:37:19] <Cork> Kartagis: Type: Function( Anything data, String textStatus, jqXHR jqXHR )
[05:37:40] <Cork> Kartagis: or if it isn't a 2xx status you use .error
[05:37:47] <Cork> 3xx isn't accessible
[05:37:52] <Kartagis> hrm
[05:37:54] <Kartagis> thanks
[05:38:13] <Cork> (3xx is handled transparently by the browser)
[05:38:24] <shoky> IamTrying: you want to click the iframe's body from outside? smth like this maybe.. var iframe = $('#iframe_display_modules')[0], doc = iframe.contentDocument, jq = iframe.contentWindow.jQuery; jq(doc.body).click();
[05:40:09] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/yp9euk4z/4/ I delibaretly passed wrong credentials and got 'Login successful' anyway
[05:40:34] <Kartagis> deliberately
[05:41:00] <ndimatteo> anyone have a second to check out my pen?
[05:41:09] <shoky> IamTrying you can also call a global function in the iframe..  $('#iframe')[0].contentWindow.myfunc();
[05:41:17] <Kartagis> ndimatteo: what's wrong with it?
[05:41:29] <IamTrying> WOW - shoky. Exactly it works
[05:41:35] <ndimatteo> Kartagis: it’s pulling in the second post, instead of the first in the feed.
[05:41:39] <IamTrying> excellent shoky. thanks a big!!
[05:41:48] <Kartagis> ndimatteo: paste
[05:41:51] <shoky> yw
[05:41:52] <ndimatteo> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VLaoar
[05:42:26] <ndimatteo> Kartagis: here’s a direct link to the feed where you can see the first post that’s being passed over: http://blog.knwm-llc.com/feed/
[05:43:11] <ndimatteo> I checked dates/publish settings/etc. and I can’t seem to understand why it’s getting passed over.
[05:44:22] <Kartagis> ndimatteo: you seem to have an offset
[05:45:07] <ndimatteo> Kartagis: how? It’s not in the script
[05:45:12] <kokut> why is $('#selector').width() * 0.935 giving me strange numbers?
[05:46:32] <Kartagis> ndimatteo: line #3 mentions offset
[05:46:53] <ndimatteo> Kartagis: yea it’s an option of the plugin, but I’m not using it when I call it farther down
[05:47:01] <Kartagis> kokut: try ,
[05:47:14] <Cork> kokut: what does .width() give you?
[05:47:43] <Cork> also what is the "strange number"?
[05:48:02] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/yp9euk4z/4/ I deliberately passed wrong credentials and got 'Login successful' anyway. I need to check if it returns 200
[05:48:27] <kokut> Cork: it gives 938, accurate
[05:48:49] <Cork> and what is the strange number?
[05:48:56] <kokut> 820
[05:49:03] <kokut> should be 877
[05:49:52] <Cork> doesn't sound like width gives you the value you think
[05:50:01] <Cork> verify that it really does: console.log($('#selector').width(), $('#selector').width() * 0.935)
[05:50:06] <Kartagis> kokut: try , instead of .
[05:50:39] <Cork> Kartagis: there isn't any comma in the number
[05:50:54] <kokut> Kartagis: unexpected number
[05:51:22] <Cork> js> print(938 * 0.935)
[05:51:30] <b-ot> Cork: 877.0300000000001
[05:51:49] <Cork> kokut: so i suspect the problem is in that .width() gives you a value you didn't expect
[05:52:42] <ndimatteo> Kartagis: any thoughts?
[05:52:50] <kokut> Cork: console.log($('#selector').width(), $('#selector').width() * 0.935) is giving me 3 numbers
[05:52:54] <Kartagis> nope
[05:52:57] <kokut> the one in the middle is wrong
[05:53:07] <Cork> three??
[05:53:16] <kokut> Cork: yea :\
[05:53:24] <Cork> you mean 3 x 3?
[05:53:29] <Cork> or 3 in one line?
[05:53:49] <Cork> (the later can't really happen)
[05:54:10] <kokut> Cork: 878 820.9300000000001
[05:54:40] <Cork> kokut: that's two numbers
[05:54:53] <kokut> well i'm retarded
[05:54:53] <Cork> so width is 878 not 938
[05:55:14] <Cork> and that is why you get the effect you didn't expect
[05:55:44] <kokut> Cork: but $(document).widt(); is giving me 938
[05:56:04] <Cork> $('#selector').width() != $(document).width()
[05:56:38] <kokut> Cork: fuck man i dont know whats wrong with me today
[05:56:42] <surianup> Hi

[06:08:19] <eddq> HI, I'm having a reall y basic issue.. I wish to dynamically update a select boxes options whilst preserving the first entry. I am storing the select element like this var $el = $('#age-ranges'); and wish to use the $el like this $($el +' option:gt(0)').remove();
[06:08:53] <eddq> how can i store the el before to allow it to be more flexible and then use the option selector after?
[06:13:56] <surianup> my problem is that how to check if my browseer support the jwplayer or not
[06:26:20] <shoky> ndimatteo: you're using a different url in your pen than the feed you linked to.  http://knwmllc.wordpress.com/feed/  vs   http://blog.knwm-llc.com/feed/   using the 2nd one seems to work as expected
[06:30:51] <ndimatteo> shoky: Thanks! I’m not sure why that makes a difference, wordpress URL vs custom URL, but I also recently when in and changed the post format from “image” to “standard.” Maybe that was excluding it from the feed? Not really sure what happened to be honest, since it was showing in the rss feed
[06:31:53] <shoky> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[06:37:17] <donguston> Anyone know how to get proper number formatting? I want to format the number for current bandwidth being used on here http://188.166.83.229/stats/
[06:38:09] <Cork> donguston: and what exactly do you mean by formatting?
[06:38:28] <donguston> Like 2,930.91 Mbps instead of 2930.91 Mbps
[06:39:33] <Cork> ok so thousand divider
[06:39:43] <Cork> donguston: there isn't anything built in for that
[06:39:52] <Cork> you would have to look for a number formatting lib
[06:40:01] <donguston> Oh ok
[06:40:08] <decx> just write Kbps
[06:40:15] <decx> ^^
[06:40:21] <donguston> decx, then the number would be too big to fit
[06:40:28] <donguston> its measured in Mbps at the moment
[06:41:13] <decx> apparently not?
[06:41:54] <donguston> Its measured in Mbps but using 2 - 3 Gbps at the moment
[06:41:58] <Cork> donguston: ex. http://www.mredkj.com/javascript/numberFormat.html#addcommas
[06:42:08] <decx> oh like that
[06:42:29] <Cork> or http://filesizejs.com/

[06:42:56] <Cork> :)
[06:47:06] <Whirled> any jquery code for scrolling a panorama image with infinite wraparound scrolling, drag direction with inertia?
[06:49:29] <BillCriswell> Whirled: You could bind to the scroll event of a div with scrolling and change an image based on the scrollLeft.
[06:49:45] <BillCriswell> You'd have to init the div with scrollLeft to the middle of something large and find a clever way to reset it to the middle.
[06:50:27] <decx> i'd think you of all people would say: use seadragon
[06:50:37] <Whirled> seadragon?
[06:54:14] <flashpoint9> Does anyone know any cool refactoring for this http://dpaste.com/2SHX0C4?
[06:55:00] <Cork> O_o
[06:55:09] <Cork> flashpoint9: ya, put the css in the stylesheet
[06:55:19] <Cork> and use a class
[06:56:30] <flashpoint9> Cork: ugh, yea ive been looking at this tooooo long
[06:57:50] <samssh> flashpoint9, Putting it in a stylesheet and using a class is the better solution, but for the sake of answering your exact question, you can pass .css() a object with property name keys and values.

[07:03:15] <BaNzounet> Hey guys, jQuery add the crsf token to an ajax request isn't it?
[07:03:30] <BaNzounet> Without doing something special I've it in my headers
[07:04:02] <BaNzounet> But I can't find anything in the documentation
[07:04:48] <joker89> Hi i am performing the next operation: $(document).scrollTop(206); $(document).scrollTop(); and I get 206 in all browsers except android stock browser. Any suggestion?
[07:06:47] <arc_> idk if this is the same bug causing this, but maybe you could try the solution this user suggests
[07:06:48] <arc_> https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=19625
[07:06:59] <arc_> er wrong link sry https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=19625#c24
[07:07:47] <joker89> Let me see
[07:09:03] <BillCriswell> joker89: What are you getting in the stock browser?
[07:09:51] <joker89> The initial value
[07:09:59] <joker89> If i had 200 i get 200
[07:10:26] <joker89> I think is mot the same issue that arc_ because i am workimg over document object
[07:10:35] <joker89> Not a div element or similar
[07:11:12] <arc_> well, you don't know what is causing the bug right?
[07:11:13] <BillCriswell> joker89: Try requestAnimationFrame(function () { console.log($(document).scrollTop()); });
[07:11:38] <joker89> Yes arc_ i dont see any similar problem on googlw
[07:12:36] <joker89> Billcriswell the scroll is performed
[07:12:50] <joker89> But i can not query the scrolltop() after set it
[07:13:04] <joker89> I can query it after the effect is complete
[07:49:59] <socialblogsite> Can anybody take the function out of the timeout for me please? http://jsfiddle.net/h7pwo64h/9/ (I’m not advanced with plugins/classes and I don’t understand timeouts (all of them are called, self-called, nested inside the others, etc and that freaks me out)
[07:51:20] <socialblogsite> this guy http://bit.ly/1JsXJom  said the timeOut should be outside the onScroll so save CPU ( Half down the page, the code under “…give your scroll event handler to requestAnimationFrame”  )
[08:48:13] <Koopz> hmm... anyone else using FF Developer Edition?
[08:49:10] <robertmaxrees> i am.
[08:49:48] <Koopz> are you able to update?
[08:49:57] <robertmaxrees> ...yes?
[08:50:46] <Koopz> i've tried that multiprocess feature today and had to turn it off again 'cause my tabs kept on crashing
[08:51:00] <robertmaxrees> it's been flawless for me on two machines so far.
[08:51:33] <Koopz> getting red update notifications telling me that background updates aren't working anymore...
[08:52:04] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[09:08:32] <ilhami> does jQuery have a template engine?
[09:08:38] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:08:50] <ilhami> is there a template engine that works with jQuery?
[09:08:56] <ilhami> like doT.js?
[09:09:16] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean "works with jquery" - they all technically do.
[09:09:48] <ilhami> I would need something that can escape output.. :P is there a lib that can do that?
[09:10:09] <robertmaxrees> "escape output" in what way?  javascript has two built-in methods to handle that.,
[09:13:43] <ilhami> robertmaxrees, to protect against XSS..
[09:13:55] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad way to handle that fwiw.
[09:13:59] <robertmaxrees> you should deal with that server-side.
[09:14:40] <ilhami> so my API shoul deal with it+
[09:14:45] <ilhami> should*
[09:15:01] <robertmaxrees> whatever takes your content in and saves it should, yeah.
[09:15:23] <ilhami> and what about when retrieving the data? :P
[09:15:30] <robertmaxrees> the server-size should still handle it.
[09:15:36] <ilhami> I should use htmlspecialchars() for that I guess.
[09:16:29] <robertmaxrees> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet
[09:16:51] <robertmaxrees> basically, sanitize it and output it safely.
[09:17:07] <robertmaxrees> don't trust javascript to protect anybody, including yourself.
[09:17:15] <robertmaxrees> *including your own code, i mean.
[09:21:17] <ilhami> sure.. so I will need some sort of sanitizer. :) there are some libs out there. I hope that Lumen comes with one.
[09:39:43] <prillian5> I have a function. Once it is fired by an event : $('#xst_carousel-1').on('slide.bs.carousel', function (e) {...}) , onec it is fired manualy. I wan't to differ which way the function is fired... Here you see which Object is returnd: http://i.imgur.com/eZeuyag.jpg
[09:39:50] <prillian5> How can I differ with an "if()" now, which one is fired?
[09:42:30] <prillian5> Is there a way to check if it is a  "m.Event" ?
[09:50:26] <robertmaxrees> there are lots of ways to do that, though I'd arguie that's not really what you want to do prillian5
[09:51:07] <prillian5> I can past the little html-page to jsfiddle so you can see what I try to do?!
[09:51:30] <robertmaxrees> as long as it's a small test case, sure.
[09:51:40] <robertmaxrees> but you probably don't want .trigger() ;)
[09:51:49] <prillian5> http://jsfiddle.net/suther/sfd6zjbg/
[09:52:03] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[09:52:03] <robertmaxrees> tjat'
[09:52:07] <robertmaxrees> *that's not a test case.
[09:52:15] <prillian5> at the bottom of the sourcecode is the function getSliderData
[09:52:25] <robertmaxrees> this isn't how you use fiddles...
[09:52:38] <jewetnit> prillian5: m instanceof $.Event
[09:52:58] <robertmaxrees> except that's not what he wants, jewetnit :)
[09:53:05] <prillian5> robertmaxrees: Its only for overview
[09:53:19] <jewetnit> what does he want I dont get it? the first log is a jQ elem, the second a jQ event
[09:53:24] <robertmaxrees> it wants know if the m property exists on a particular event object.
[09:53:34] <jewetnit> ah right
[09:53:37] <prillian5> To explain what I try. Maybe my startpoint is still wrong?!
[09:53:40] <jewetnit> hasOwnProperty?
[09:53:43] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:53:45] <jewetnit> :)
[09:53:50] <robertmaxrees> just if (m.Event)
[09:53:57] <robertmaxrees> except that's still a bad idea imo.
[09:54:07] <robertmaxrees> if you're using .trigger() or anything like it, you're doing it wrong.
[09:54:11] <prillian5> On slide, the event is fired and output the index of the slider, so that i got Page-Navi   (1/4)
[09:54:28] <prillian5> Problem is to initiate the Slider first time, if no event is there
[09:55:27] <prillian5> Thats the starting point of my problem. Now I thought... I could send an object to a function to initiate this. But in the function there is e.target used... which is only available if an event is fired
[09:55:42] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[09:56:00] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to initialize the slider?
[09:56:08] <prillian5> yes.
[09:56:13] <robertmaxrees> just init it on pageload.
[09:56:46] <prillian5> ok, I dosn't try to init the slider but the counter in it 1/4
[09:56:51] <prillian5> Page 1 of 4
[09:57:13] <jewetnit> robertmaxrees: do you understand the problem prillian5 is having?
[09:57:13] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean the pagination?
[09:57:27] <robertmaxrees> looks like he's trying to handle the pagination on the carousel.
[09:57:39] <jewetnit> so they slide automatically or what?
[09:57:42] <jewetnit> the fiddle works for me
[09:57:54] <robertmaxrees> check out what happens witht he pagination when you hit the arrows.
[09:58:11] <robertmaxrees> prillian5 if you want help, you'll want to strip thgis down and use jsfiddle the right way.
[09:58:24] <jewetnit> the page indicator?
[09:58:29] <jewetnit> is fucked
[09:58:30] <jewetnit> or what
[09:58:46] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't do what it should - changes from 1/4 to 2/0 when i click the next arrow.
[09:59:33] <prillian5> robertmaxrees: exactly, the pagination :)
[10:00:09] <robertmaxrees> so first off: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sfd6zjbg/3/
[10:00:16] <robertmaxrees> your JS had all kinds of weird problems.
[10:01:32] <robertmaxrees> second, if ($(e)) { will always return true
[10:03:51] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's your getSliderData func that's weird.,
[10:03:54] <robertmaxrees> brb
[10:04:21] <prillian5> robertmaxrees: yes, this if($e) was the ponit i stuck... there I've tryed a bit.
[10:04:49] <prillian5> this is the place where I search for the if-statement to differ the kind of request.
[10:04:57] <prillian5> BTW: a little bit cleand: http://jsfiddle.net/suther/sfd6zjbg/9/
[10:08:03] <prillian5> here i removed the second, not needed slider: http://jsfiddle.net/suther/sfd6zjbg/11/
[10:09:28] <prillian5> in fiddle (js field) Line 42 getSliderDate is called with the Event-Object.
[10:09:56] <prillian5> And on line 30, I try to call it with an object which point to the DOM.
[10:10:09] <prillian5> Maybe this is the wrong point to start...
[10:13:46] <jewetnit> prillian5: is this any better http://jsfiddle.net/18L1xk1j/ ?
[10:13:58] <jewetnit> just the 4th page shows no page indicator at all
[10:14:13] <jewetnit> i gotta go now though, make some dinner, i'll be back later though
[10:15:07] <prillian5> jewetnit: thanks a lot
[10:15:27] <prillian5> 4th indicator is missing, cause of a missing <span> in html.
[10:15:28] <jewetnit> prillain5: http://jsfiddle.net/704hers1/ page 4 works as well
[10:15:30] <jewetnit> yeah
[10:15:32] <jewetnit> i fixed that
[10:15:45] <jewetnit> tell me if this fixes it\
[10:15:57] <prillian5> jes, really great.
[10:15:59] <jewetnit> :)
[10:15:59] <prillian5> thanks a lot
[10:16:03] <jewetnit> no problem
[10:17:01] <MarkProffitt> I need the ID or text of each LI,  how do I get it?  http://jsfiddle.net/rL83a75p/
[10:17:40] <jewetnit> use $('li').each
[10:18:06] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: or $('li').map might be nicer even
[10:19:14] <MarkProffitt> I already have the node,  I need the ID, but it is saying it is undefined
[10:20:51] <prillian5> http://jsfiddle.net/suther/rL83a75p/1/
[10:21:09] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: http://jsfiddle.net/rL83a75p/2/
[10:21:21] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: is that what you want?
[10:21:32] <jewetnit> you can access those from regular js as well, you dont need jq
[10:21:52] <jewetnit> but i'd use $.map or $.each instead of a for loop, I feel like it's more readable
[10:22:06] <MarkProffitt> Ijewetnit: I need it broken out per UL
[10:22:54] <jewetnit> what do you mean with broken out?
[10:22:55] <jewetnit> ah
[10:22:58] <jewetnit> out of the function ?
[10:23:00] <jewetnit> what do you mean
[10:23:08] <prillian5> MarkProffitt: http://jsfiddle.net/suther/rL83a75p/3/
[10:23:21] <MarkProffitt> jewetnit:  I need to save it as different lists, not one
[10:23:32] <jewetnit> one per ul?
[10:23:34] <jewetnit> or what?
[10:24:10] <MarkProffitt> jewetnit,  each UL is a list. I need to save each list seperately
[10:24:42] <prillian5> iterate eich ul .group and do your stuff
[10:24:51] <prillian5> I post you a fiddle
[10:24:56] <prillian5> you seen that?
[10:25:44] <AnnaMaria__> Hello! I’m looking to access every element of a specific class and iterate over it in a js file. I'm trying http://pastie.org/10195165, but nothing's happening.
[10:26:20] <MarkProffitt> prillian5, I'm looking at it
[10:27:55] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: how about something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/axtatnr6/
[10:28:15] <BillCriswell> AnnaMaria__: You can do $('.chatbox').each(function () { var $this = $(this); /* $this will be the chatbox you're currently on */ });
[10:29:03] <BillCriswell> AnnaMaria__: Not sure where you're getting the conversation_id from so that could be an issue.
[10:29:26] <AnnaMaria__> BillCriswell: No problem with the conversation_id (it’s passed in). Let me try that.
[10:29:37] <MarkProffitt> jewetnik, yes, like that
[10:30:14] <jewetnit> MarkProffit: :) is it fixed now?
[10:30:22] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: or what needs to happen
[10:31:41] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: slightly cleaner http://jsfiddle.net/564cb1ay/
[10:31:59] <AnnaMaria__> BillCriswell: How can I grab a conversation_id from “this"?
[10:32:22] <MarkProffitt> jewetnik, it give me something to work with.
[10:32:40] <jewetnit> :)
[10:32:45] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: you need more hepl?
[10:32:46] <jewetnit> help*
[10:35:13] <MarkProffitt> jewetnik, I'll take it if you are offering.  I need the Index of each UL.
[10:35:37] <__malloc__> Hey guys! If you enter: http://www.mcaarq.com/ my portfolio, will show you ALL and i need that when you enter the web takes you directly to PROJECTS. Any idea how can I do that?
[10:35:50] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: where?
[10:35:54] <jewetnit> how do you want it
[10:35:59] <jewetnit> its available already
[10:36:05] <__malloc__> This is my custom JS file: http://pastebin.com/W7ZHfYw8
[10:36:09] <jewetnit> indexInArray is the index of the li in the ul
[10:36:24] <MarkProffitt> I also need the index of the UL
[10:36:48] <__malloc__> In the Chrome console, it works: jQuery('.thumbs').isotope({ filter: '.mca-arq-uruguay-argentina'})
[10:36:52] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: http://jsfiddle.net/n8ztwn0d/
[10:36:59] <jewetnit> if you look at line 4
[10:37:04] <crillegustafsson> if div A show, I want to hide div B
[10:37:06] <jewetnit> you see the first argument, is the ulIndex
[10:37:21] <crillegustafsson> https://jsfiddle.net/trfd4v1g/
[10:39:14] <MarkProffitt> jewetnit: Thank you. I think that will do it
[10:39:38] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: you're welcome :) if you need more help just ask
[10:39:58] <crillegustafsson> https://jsfiddle.net/trfd4v1g/2/
[10:40:03] <crillegustafsson> how to hide button A ?
[10:40:19] <crillegustafsson> when button B is showing
[10:40:22] <MarkProffitt> jewetnit thank you very much!!! :-D
[10:41:28] <jewetnit> crillegustafsso: https://jsfiddle.net/0sadup5r/ fixed, jQuery wasn't included
[10:41:41] <jewetnit> and you didn't use the $.fn.css method correctly
[10:41:51] <jewetnit> it accepts the value as second parameter
[10:42:14] <crillegustafsson> oh ok :P
[10:42:15] <jewetnit> https://jsfiddle.net/q8y5LrbL/
[10:42:22] <jewetnit> you dont need the $(function() {...}); wrapper
[10:42:49] <crillegustafsson> ok, thx =)
[10:43:05] <crillegustafsson> do I need jquery edge ?
[10:43:10] <jewetnit> no
[10:43:23] <crillegustafsson> ok, that was enabled now
[10:43:27] <jewetnit> well
[10:43:30] <jewetnit> you need some jQuery version
[10:43:37] <crillegustafsson> ok =)
[10:43:41] <jewetnit> you don't need edge, but you do need some version of jQuery
[10:43:45] <AnnaMaria__> Does .each(function()... in jQuery need parameters passed into function? I’ve seen it both ways throughout the ‘net.
[10:43:47] <crillegustafsson> thats true =)
[10:43:58] <robertmaxrees> AnnaMaria__ depends.
[10:44:03] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need the params, don't pass them.
[10:44:08] <jewetnit> AnnaMaria__: $('selector').each doesnt
[10:44:10] <jewetnit> $.each does
[10:44:31] <AnnaMaria__> robertmaxrees: I see. Thank you! So, in my case, I don’t need them. Hm.
[10:44:36] <jewetnit> or do you mean callback arguments
[10:44:38] <jewetnit> right]
[10:44:44] <robertmaxrees> they're talking about the calback args.
[10:44:51] <robertmaxrees> *callback
[10:49:23] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I’m having a hard time changing content after it has been loaded with an ajax request
[10:49:38] <robertmaxrees> kinna busy, but what's up?
[10:50:01] <notchris> robertmaxrees: http://rocketb.in/paste/N6nJk6
[10:50:09] <notchris> The secon ajax request
[10:50:16] <notchris> second*
[10:50:26] <notchris> I’m trying to do something after “handleData"
[10:51:26] <Connor> Hello.  We're upgrading jquery and jquery-ui (1.8.16 to 1.11) and having some issues with the dialogs under modal.
[10:51:37] <Connor> The dialogs are under the overlay for some reason..and I'm not using appendTo either.
[10:52:28] <jewetnit> notchris: what do you want to do after handleData?
[10:52:47] <notchris> jewetnit: See where it wraps the content in a table?
[10:52:55] <notchris> I want to then do something to the table
[10:53:13] <jewetnit> line#?
[10:53:31] <jewetnit> what do oyu want to do to the table?
[10:53:33] <notchris> jewetnit: line 88
[10:53:38] <notchris> It wraps all of that content in a table
[10:53:45] <notchris> Then I want to do something to the table
[10:53:59] <notchris> But it won’t let me target the table in that function
[10:55:47] <jewetnit>  $selectTicket.find("td").filter doesnt give you any tds? or what
[10:56:18] <notchris> jewetnit: I want the table
[10:56:34] <notchris> That exists only once it wraps the content
[10:56:43] <jewetnit> yeah
[10:56:44] <notchris> Well, exists only when the function runs
[10:56:49] <jewetnit> ah
[10:56:54] <jewetnit> when its done it doesn't anymore?
[10:57:11] <notchris> I cant reference the table until after handleData has run
[10:57:20] <notchris> So I want to do something after handleData
[10:58:03] <jewetnit> what keeps you from doing something after handleData?
[10:58:28] <notchris> I tried to target that table
[10:58:30] <notchris> It doesn’t work
[10:58:44] <notchris> So I need to make sure it happens after handleData
[11:00:10] <jewetnit> hold on im eating atm\
[11:01:17] <notchris> TY
[11:04:32] <duch_kazatel> notchris which line was it?
[11:05:07] <notchris> robertmaxrees: 88
[11:06:10] <devt204> I'm dynamically trying to update a content/ but it happen's after page reload
[11:06:16] <robertmaxrees> before line 76, do a console.log($(result));, notchris
[11:06:19] <robertmaxrees> what happens?
[11:07:50] <notchris> robertmaxrees: e.fn.init[32]
[11:07:56] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:08:43] <notchris> hmmm
[11:09:19] <notchris> http://puu.sh/hS0DJ/42fe7c64ef.png
[11:09:24] <robertmaxrees> so first off, i'd change $('.dateSelect').on('click', function() { to a delegated listener and get it out of that other ajax call.
[11:09:25] <robertmaxrees> that smells.
[11:09:40] <notchris> Hmmm
[11:10:27] <robertmaxrees> try doing console.log($(result).html()); - what do you get with that?
[11:10:34] <Connor> Anyone?  Dialog appearing under the overlay after upgrading to Jqueryui  1.11 and jquery 1.11.3?
[11:10:45] <robertmaxrees> Connor check your CSS>
[11:10:50] <robertmaxrees> that's usually a problem with custom styles.
[11:10:53] <devt204> robertmaxress I'm using a countdown plugin here http://mmanya.com/, what I'm trying to achieve is, when count down reaches 00:00:00 the text above countdown timer should dynamically changes, but it doesn't happen dynamically i need to refresh the page in order to see the text
[11:10:55] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, we'd have to see an exampke.
[11:11:25] <robertmaxrees> devt204 does that plugin have a callback?
[11:11:26] <Connor> robertmaxrees: From what I can tell, the new version looks to do away with the z-index stuff..
[11:11:37] <robertmaxrees> Connor check positioning.
[11:12:00] <robertmaxrees> and re-verify everything.
[11:12:19] <Connor> what am I looking for?
[11:12:34] <robertmaxrees> positioning and z-indexing stuff on the overlay and modal.
[11:13:01] <devt204> robertmaxress, not sure of that yet though using this (https://wordpress.org/plugins/uji-countdown/) one
[11:13:11] <Connor> no z-index on the overlay or the dialog after the upgrade.  (was inline on old version)
[11:13:21] <robertmaxrees> oh...
[11:13:36] <robertmaxrees> Connor without seeing it there's not really much i can do to help...
[11:13:53] <robertmaxrees> devt204 that's going to be a PITA.
[11:14:44] <robertmaxrees> devt204 you'll need to setup a recursive timeout to check when the timer has reached that time and then do whatever.
[11:16:05] <Connor> WTF, the example on jqueryui has z-index in line too..
[11:16:17] <crillegustafsson> my code hide my div forever :P
[11:16:52] <crillegustafsson> is there any chance to hide DIV A when DIV B is displaying ?
[11:17:21] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson sure, hide it when you show div b.
[11:17:46] <crillegustafsson> but how to put it in HTML code
[11:17:53] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[11:18:03] <robertmaxrees> what code do you have now?
[11:18:18] <crillegustafsson> this
[11:18:25] <crillegustafsson> https://jsfiddle.net/0sadup5r/
[11:18:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:18:57] <crillegustafsson> what ? =)
[11:18:58] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to hide one button when you show another?
[11:19:03] <crillegustafsson> yes =)
[11:19:08] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/
[11:19:12] <robertmaxrees> you really need to go through this.
[11:19:25] <robertmaxrees> specifically https://learn.jquery.com/events/
[11:20:30] <checkit> Hey guys... how can I return an object from a callback? Ideally, I'd like the following to return all results to the "results" variable calling the function. I realize the code as is will not work but I'm looking to accomplish the theary this hints at: http://jsfiddle.net/asv8ddrb/1/
[11:20:34] <devt204> robertmaxress might not look good, this is what i've there http://jsfiddle.net/qtr23aeu/
[11:21:11] <robertmaxrees> checkit this assumes that APP.Method.get will return that value.,
[11:21:14] <crillegustafsson> nothing about show or hide there
[11:21:20] <robertmaxrees> but you're maybe thinking http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/asv8ddrb/2/
[11:21:27] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson you need an event listener on the buttons.
[11:21:32] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson you need to learn the basics.
[11:21:38] <robertmaxrees> this is a very simple thing to want to do.
[11:21:39] <crillegustafsson> okey.
[11:21:42] <crillegustafsson> =)
[11:33:23] <notchris> robertmaxrees: How do I delegate that click function?
[11:37:20] <printForever> jquery hover over one element and change background on another
[11:37:45] <printForever> problem is, the main element, on which you're detecting the hover, is not an image
[11:38:15] <printForever> so I'm not sure how to store the image, and there should be 5 images stored for 5 different main elements
[11:39:37] <printForever> to explain closer, you hover 2 level deep child element, in order to change the background of the parent element (that is 2 levels up, of course)
[11:43:01] <robertmaxrees> notchris http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[11:44:00] <robertmaxrees> printForever huh?
[11:44:27] <robertmaxrees> printForever just bind your listener to the parent element.
[11:44:36] <printForever> I have
[11:44:42] <printForever> but I dont know how to store the image
[11:44:44] <printForever> I want to show
[11:44:59] <robertmaxrees> store the src of it and set the background.
[11:45:01] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[11:45:31] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/gAZWgjtJ
[11:45:56] <robertmaxrees>  $(this).parents().eq(4) scares me.
[11:46:08] <robertmaxrees> but sure, it'll probably be something like that.
[11:46:12] <printForever> well... thats how things are...
[11:46:22] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to use .closest()
[11:46:38] <robertmaxrees> or filter using a selector of some kind.
[11:46:38] <printForever> parent has an ID #parnetid
[11:46:48] <printForever> yes, I could filter entire page
[11:46:55] <printForever> but I can simply go up the ladder
[11:47:03] <robertmaxrees> DOM traversal is expensive.
[11:47:04] <printForever> the thing is... how do I store the image? :(
[11:47:07] <robertmaxrees> so use .closest()
[11:47:13] <robertmaxrees> and what do you mean "store the image"
[11:47:15] <printForever> ok, I will change to closest
[11:47:17] <robertmaxrees> store the image sourc.
[11:47:26] <printForever> HTML source?
[11:47:30] <printForever> CSS source?
[11:47:39] <robertmaxrees> how is the image referenced?
[11:47:43] <robertmaxrees> is it a background image or what?
[11:47:50] <printForever> background image
[11:47:59] <printForever> I have 5 different links
[11:48:05] <robertmaxrees> then grab the value for the relevant background image.
[11:48:06] <printForever> when you hover over each of them, the BG should change
[11:48:08] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, make a fiddle.
[11:48:18] <printForever> for each of them, the bg is different for each link
[11:48:40] <robertmaxrees> if the explanation dodn't make much sense the first time around... ;)
[11:49:26] <printForever> you have 5 links - 1 / 2 /3 / 4 / 5
[11:49:31] <robertmaxrees> that's not helping.
[11:49:33] <robertmaxrees> please create a fiddle.
[11:49:41] <printForever> when you hover over 2 it should show bg...
[11:50:12] <printForever> I will try to do it on my own for now
[11:50:20] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:50:23] <printForever> btw. why is closest() better than .parent?
[11:50:28] <printForever> they both go up the DOM?
[11:50:31] <printForever> so...
[11:50:41] <robertmaxrees> you give it a selector and then it stops going up the tree.
[11:50:44] <robertmaxrees> much more efficient.
[11:53:53] <printForever> got it!
[11:53:56] <printForever> solved
[11:54:01] <printForever> its not optimized
[11:54:03] <printForever> but it works
[11:54:08] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[12:04:34] <printForever> how would I apply fade between them?
[12:05:29] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/peprFuFJ
[12:05:57] <printForever> when I add .fadeIn(300) at the end of the 2nd line, it switches like its not there
[12:06:50] <robertmaxrees> iirc you can't fade background image transitions.
[12:07:10] <printForever> because... its not a vaule?
[12:07:32] <robertmaxrees> because you cannot animate a css background?
[12:07:45] <robertmaxrees> you can fade an element out and another one in.
[12:07:56] <printForever> right...
[12:07:58] <broman> Can anyone help me?? im trying to use jquery.msgbox but im getting $.msgBox is not a function
[12:08:15] <robertmaxrees> broman make sure you're loading the plugin.
[12:08:15] <printForever> broman, check if jQuery is loaded
[12:08:24] <printForever> or the plugin, as rm said
[12:09:02] <broman> yes i am
[12:09:21] <broman> when i see the source code through firefox ... i click the link and it shows the messagebox code
[12:09:25] <robertmaxrees> and you're loading it before you try to use it?>
[12:09:30] <broman> jquery is fully loaded
[12:09:34] <broman> yes!
[12:09:45] <broman> im trying to use in a index.js file that is loaded after the msgbox
[12:09:57] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you do console.log($.msgBox); ?
[12:10:06] <robertmaxrees> vs console.log(jQuery.msgBox); ?
[12:10:21] <robertmaxrees> also: are you loading jquery more than once?
[12:10:21] <broman> let me try
[12:10:25] <printForever> oh that console.log... how helpful it has become
[12:10:58] <broman> console.log($.msgBox)
[12:11:00] <broman> and
[12:11:20] <broman> both undefined
[12:11:31] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not loading jqueyr more than once.
[12:12:10] <broman> robertmaxrees,  that was it!! thank you so much!
[12:12:17] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[12:12:22] <printForever> :)
[12:28:45] <deathanchor> hey, I have problem with using jquery.tablesorter.min.js, I got this error on firebug [TypeError: name.toLowerCase is not a function], but I use this same sorter on other pages with out problems.
[12:29:11] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're passing in a string and not a number for whatever that method call it.
[12:29:14] <robertmaxrees> *is
[12:29:56] <deathanchor> tablesorter calls it, I was wondering if there was a way to force tablesorter to consider the fields of the table as strings.
[12:30:12] <robertmaxrees> without seeing docs/an example, it should be doing that by default.
[12:30:47] <deathanchor> well I have one column with negative numbers "-6" and positive numbers "5"
[12:30:57] <deathanchor> I think that's where it is getting borked.
[12:31:02] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[12:33:54] <deathanchor> hmm.. weird... removed the headers option and it works fine now, oh well.
[12:52:21] <adv_> how do i programmatically emit an event?
[13:07:02] <BillCriswell> adv_: .trigger() ?
[13:11:26] <claytonzaugg> How would you replace text between object braces before running the html code? <script>this.function({ "replace" : "this", "and" : "this"})
[13:11:57] <claytonzaugg> for example, $("#demo-area").html($(data).html());
[13:12:24] <claytonzaugg> I want to change some of the HTML code from data before it gets applies to #demo-area
[13:14:27] <BillCriswell> claytonzaugg: You can do like $('#demo').html(function(i, html) { return html.replace('whatever', ''); }).something();
[13:14:48] <BillCriswell> Wait.. what's data?
[13:14:57] <claytonzaugg> data is a template file
[13:15:01] <claytonzaugg> html
[13:15:30] <claytonzaugg> with <script> tags at the bottom, and ultimately I'm trying to update the options I'm passing into the object in the script tag
[13:15:40] <BillCriswell> You can do .html(data.replace('whatever', '')) if I'm understanding you right.
[13:16:34] <BillCriswell> Think I'd need to see a demo.
[13:17:45] <claytonzaugg> but the problem is, sometimes there may be content inside the  braces so it's not necesarily empty.  Maybe is there a way to replace all text between '({' and '})' erasing anything inbetween?
[13:18:27] <claytonzaugg> Unfortunately I am an intern on this project so I can't show the code necessarily
[13:19:00] <BillCriswell> You can at least show the input and the output you expect.
[13:19:30] <claytonzaugg> okay one sec
[13:22:25] <claytonzaugg> BillCriswell, sorry I'm putting this together in JSFiddle, almost done
[13:22:33] <BillCriswell> Ok
[13:27:36] <claytonzaugg> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/ypzf70m6/
[13:27:47] <claytonzaugg> BillCriswell, let me know if that makes sense of if I need to clarify further
[13:29:03] <claytonzaugg> the html portion is from the template, the data part, it would be integrated and run through the #demo-data section I have on the page I'm working on
[13:35:09] <BillCriswell> I am even more confused now.
[13:38:00] <PlanC> Alright, I have a pretty strange goal
[13:38:35] <PlanC> If a link (<a href="http://test.com" id="test">Click</a>) is clicked then it should go to
[13:38:51] <PlanC> http://anonymous-redirect.com/?link=http://test.com
[13:39:01] <PlanC> If it however is right-clicked it should show as
[13:39:02] <PlanC> http://test.com
[13:39:24] <PlanC> The reason to why I want to do this is because hotlinking sometimes is disallowed
[13:39:48] <PlanC> and if the user wants to use the browser's "Save link as" feature then it'll run into trouble if it goes through the anonymous-redirect.com service
[13:40:34] <BillCriswell> If you adjust the link on the click event it should behave as you want and shouldn't mess with right clicking (maybe?)
[13:47:37] <claytonzaugg> BillCriswell, so let me rephrase it this way.  How can I search through an HTML file for ({ and }) and replace the data between them?
[13:52:00] <BillCriswell> claytonzaugg: You can use .indexOf('({') and indexOf('})') and get what's between there, then for the ones after the first you can pass the last indexOf from '})'.
[13:52:43] <claytonzaugg> BillCriswell, thank you!
[13:52:59] <BillCriswell> claytonzaugg: Is there only one ({ and }) ?
[13:53:13] <claytonzaugg> yes
[13:59:56] <BillCriswell> claytonzaugg: http://jsfiddle.net/ypzf70m6/1/ this is what I was thinking for the most part.
[14:01:25] <BillCriswell> Also s.replace(/\(\{.+\}\)/, 'Regex ewww');
[14:01:44] <BillCriswell> Ok I have to run later.
[14:36:41] <_August_> can anyone take a quick look at this. Im trying to toggle a class of other divs if it is not the current being clicked. for some reason its not working, its not adding the class at all http://pastebin.com/0WjYe0UC
[14:37:12] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a simple fiddle?
[14:46:19] <robertmaxrees> _August_ because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pstc1q5r/ works.
[14:53:46] <Mr21> _August_: .find('.min .max').toggleClass('min max') Is it normal to have a space ' ' inside the find?
[14:54:09] <robertmaxrees> hah, he probably means to have , there instead.
[14:57:52] <_August_> robertmaxrees: its suppose to remove the class from the other on when you click a new div
[14:58:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:00:28] <_August_> its suppose to toggle the class back to min if you click a new div
[15:01:00] <_August_> lets say i have 3 div, all of them have min and i click one of them. the div i clicked turns into max
[15:01:01] <robertmaxrees> is it toggling or removing? because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pstc1q5r/1/
[15:01:18] <_August_> and lets say i click another div, the new div i clicked turns into max as well
[15:01:32] <_August_> but the other div that i previously clicked turns back into min
[15:01:55] <robertmaxrees> oh.  easy.   one se.c
[15:02:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pstc1q5r/2/
[15:03:34] <robertmaxrees> if you need to fully remove the min class - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pstc1q5r/3/
[15:05:50] <_August_> yeah i tried that before, it didnt work for some reason
[15:06:45] <_August_> let me make a fddle real quick
[15:06:46] <robertmaxrees> because your .find() is broken.
[15:06:57] <robertmaxrees> .find('.min .max') isn't what you want.
[15:07:14] <_August_> just find max right?
[15:07:43] <robertmaxrees> you wanted .find('.min, .max') before, but really you just need to find .max if you follow my example.
[15:08:38] <jwmann> typeof [] => "object" and $.type( [] ) => "array" make me sad
[15:08:52] <jwmann> Why can't typeof be as kool as $.type()
[15:09:10] <robertmaxrees> because types in js are lol
[15:09:55] <jwmann> typeof Types => "lol"
[15:14:03] <zotherstupidguy> hello js ppl, i got a punch of ips that i want to map on a map, to put on a large screen. whats a good way to start?
[15:14:21] <robertmaxrees> not javascript.
[15:14:34] <zotherstupidguy> jquery
[15:14:51] <robertmaxrees> jquery is javascript.
[15:14:57] <Mr21> jwmann: hahaha
[15:15:16] <zotherstupidguy> i am not a UI guy, i am guessing that you guys done this before, give me somthing that if i battled with will produce good resutls
[15:15:16] <robertmaxrees> zotherstupidguy you need a geoip service to do the looking.
[15:15:40] <zotherstupidguy> robertmaxrees i got this covered, i have the country of every ip
[15:15:53] <robertmaxrees> okay.  then color in stuff on a map.
[15:15:54] <zotherstupidguy> now i need to plot it on a map, i have no idea where to start
[15:16:01] <robertmaxrees> "plot it on a map" is ephemeral.
[15:17:19] <zotherstupidguy> ok, how
[15:18:14] <robertmaxrees> use an image map - when you get back the country from the API, use CSS to color in the relevant bit on the map.
[15:19:02] <zotherstupidguy> great, whats the simplest approach to this, a lib, api somthing for stupid guy like me to go 1,2,3 done
[15:19:21] <zotherstupidguy> do you guys use googlemaps or somthing else?
[15:19:29] <zotherstupidguy> which is simpler?
[15:19:33] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:19:41] <robertmaxrees> you're assuming people in here have done what you're trying to do.
[15:20:00] <robertmaxrees> you'd probably end up using something like google maps, though I'm not sure if it supports shading and whatnot.
[15:20:00] <zotherstupidguy> i have seen it done with twitter many times
[15:20:14] <robertmaxrees> great!  go grab one of those and look at the page source for an example :)
[15:20:20] <stalcott> Are you allowed to use ":" in a dom id?
[15:20:24] <some0ne> hello, I have an issue with maps api v3, I put custom marker, but the default red ones are displayed over them on load. When I go to another page of my website, then I go back, the behaviour is normal ... does someone have a clue ? Thank you very much
[15:20:31] <robertmaxrees> stalcott yes, but I would avoid it.
[15:20:39] <zotherstupidguy> robertmaxrees thanks :)
[15:22:42] <stalcott> robertmaxrees: jquery selector coming back undefined when using ":" such as $("#category:234515619")
[15:22:59] <robertmaxrees> stalcott you have to escape it.
[15:23:09] <robertmaxrees> i think with \\
[15:23:14] <stalcott> robertmaxrees: thanks
[16:20:22] <PlanC> I have a button that is created inside a function with .append()
[16:20:33] <PlanC> I'm trying to detect if the button is clicked
[16:20:42] <robertmaxrees> event delegation.
[16:20:58] <PlanC> It's working for the button that is added through append()
[16:21:02] <checkit> Guys, I'm having some trouble with a deffered object I'm hoping you can help with... http://jsfiddle.net/fbrhnmow/5/
[16:21:22] <robertmaxrees> PlanC you want event delegation - that's how you should handle those cases.
[16:26:47] <PlanC> robertmaxress: I made a jsfiddle out of the problem: https://jsfiddle.net/L65175ap/
[16:27:14] <robertmaxrees> there's an entire "javascript" panel fwiw :)
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> and use event delegation - what about that is confusiong?
[16:27:37] <PlanC> I'm just using that as a test
[16:27:48] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:28:02] <PlanC> But my question is, why isn't it detecting the other links clicks?
[16:28:26] <robertmaxrees> the documentation for .on() explains this, but basically the elements don't exist when you run the binding.
[16:28:34] <robertmaxrees> so there's nothing to bind to.
[16:28:46] <robertmaxrees> also, you can't duplicate IDs.
[16:29:30] <PlanC> Why not?
[16:29:45] <robertmaxrees> because it's not valid.
[16:29:54] <PlanC> I'll keep that in mind, thanks
[16:30:03] <robertmaxrees> jquery will stop at the first element with that ID.
[16:30:21] <PlanC> Ah ok
[16:30:51] <PlanC> If I want multiple links to do the same thing, how would I go about doing it?
[16:31:01] <PlanC> Adding an onclick parameter with a function inside?
[16:31:13] <robertmaxrees> use the delegated syntax of .on()
[16:31:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L65175ap/3/ like this.
[16:32:42] <PlanC> It doesn't seem to be working though?
[16:33:02] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle i just shared functions perfectly...
[16:33:55] <arc_> the whole purpose of an id is that it's unique
[16:34:07] <robertmaxrees> arc_ yep.
[16:35:23] <PlanC> When I click on the links none of them show an alert
[16:35:30] <robertmaxrees> they all work for me.
[16:35:49] <PlanC> Try right clicking
[16:36:12] <arc_> isn't more required to prevent default of context menu
[16:36:18] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[16:36:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L65175ap/4/
[16:37:02] <arc_> middle mouse also opens a new tab for me
[16:37:15] <robertmaxrees> right, so what's the real point here?
[16:37:31] <PlanC> Works perfectly, big thanks!
[16:37:35] <Scriptonaut> dose anyone know if there's a way to select with conditions of a child element?
[16:37:44] <robertmaxrees> .filter() is one way.
[16:37:49] <PlanC> (except for the middle mouse, but that's not vital)
[16:37:50] <Scriptonaut> so like, "Grab all the divs who have a child with a checked checkbox inside them"
[16:38:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd use .filter or .map for that.
[16:38:16] <Scriptonaut> ok, thanks
[16:45:18] <PlanC> Does anyone here operate any sites?
[16:45:26] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[16:46:34] <Mr_Moon> siteS?
[16:46:44] <PlanC> I mean sites as in website
[16:46:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:46:53] <robertmaxrees> i mean "operate"
[16:47:00] <PlanC> operate = run/own
[16:47:12] <robertmaxrees> i don't own mine, but i help run a few yeah.
[16:47:29] <Mr_Moon> heh.... sorry my question was poorly phrased. I kinda meant "operate?" really too ;)
[16:47:48] <Mr_Moon> I build lots... operate / have a hand in a couple too.
[16:48:04] <PlanC> That's really cool
[16:48:11] <PlanC> Lots of JS involved?
[16:48:20] <Mr_Moon> ummmmm some, yeah.
[16:48:29] <robertmaxrees> i work for the largest online retailer of home improvement products.
[16:48:36] <PlanC> wow
[16:48:40] <Mr_Moon> more in the stuff I'v ebuilt rather than the stuff I manage.
[16:48:47] <robertmaxrees> *largest in the US i mean.
[16:49:04] <PlanC> That's impressive
[16:49:10] <Mr_Moon> I work for a digital agency in New Zealand... so building new sites all the time rather than managing existing ones.
[16:49:55] <PlanC> Why don't you guys launch a start-up?
[16:50:10] <Scriptonaut> does anyone know why there isn't a $.delete?
[16:50:10] <robertmaxrees> i like my job and make really good money.
[16:50:13] <PlanC> You clearly have the experience to code, all you need is an idea
[16:50:18] <Mr_Moon> heh always been somewhat tempted. used to be self-employed... but like the steady income of being employed.
[16:50:22] <robertmaxrees> and the willingness to not eat.
[16:50:30] <Mr_Moon> lol that too!
[16:50:30] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut what would that do?
[16:50:38] <Scriptonaut> same thing as $.get and $.post
[16:50:42] <Scriptonaut> but with a delete action
[16:50:49] <Scriptonaut> delete method*
[16:51:00] <robertmaxrees> oh a convenience for RESTful stuff?  maybe an old ie kind of thing.
[16:51:17] <Scriptonaut> ya restful stuff, I dunno about the old ie kind of thing
[16:51:25] <Scriptonaut> delete is a pretty new type of request
[16:51:29] <Mr_Moon> what do you do @PLanC ?
[16:51:39] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut that's why i say that.
[16:51:55] <Scriptonaut> I guess you gotta do: $.ajax({ url: '/blah', type: 'DELETE'
[16:56:51] <Mr_Moon> Hey robertmaxrees - just out of interest... how come your site doesn't do mobile / responsive? not being picky... just curious :)
[16:57:11] <robertmaxrees> Mr_Moon huh?
[16:57:12] <robertmaxrees> sure it does.
[16:57:21] <randomguy1> maybe dumb question, are all events asynchronous, or is it just delegated events?
[16:57:27] <robertmaxrees> (assuming i know what you mean by "your site")
[16:57:34] <robertmaxrees> randomguy1 wat
[16:57:36] <Mr_Moon> heh sorry... github stalked you ;)
[16:57:45] <robertmaxrees> Mr_Moon you mean my employer's site?
[16:57:50] <Mr_Moon> yeah.. sorry!
[16:57:51] <robertmaxrees> because it does - device detection.
[16:57:57] <Mr_Moon> ahhhhhh
[16:58:05] <robertmaxrees> we're working on a major transition as well.
[16:58:07] <Mr_Moon> heh sorry... I just tried it in browser. good answer :)
[16:58:26] <robertmaxrees> our current mobile offering isn't perfect, but it's getting htere.
[16:58:41] <Mr_Moon> pretty big site anyways, so I'm sure it's a major either way, right?
[16:59:09] <randomguy1> got this code I'm trying to help a guy out with on S.O.  http://jsfiddle.net/95vaaxsL/8/  I added a remove all button to simulate a spamming of click events on the remove buttons.  the code is currently removing them all, and I'm trying to get it to not remove the last one.  But I do a console.log of the line count in the remove function and they all come back with the same number, as if all the events are processing asynchronousl
[16:59:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah, and we have a really small dev team, so it's not as easy as just willing it into place.
[16:59:30] <Mr_Moon> heh amen. been there :)
[16:59:42] <ilhami> robertmaxrees, sup dude? :D
[16:59:49] <robertmaxrees> ilhami hey man
[16:59:55] <ilhami> I went over to Laravel. :P
[16:59:59] <ilhami> it does a lot of things for me.
[17:00:06] <robertmaxrees> yuck php.
[17:00:12] <Mr_Moon> just always curious when I see a site that isn't obviously mobile friendly. Love to  hear others experiences :)
[17:00:13] <ilhami> so I don't have to worry much.
[17:00:47] <robertmaxrees> Mr_Moon yeah, we're taking care of  abunch of different problems right now, including a transition away from coldfusion.
[17:01:01] <Mr_Moon> cool :) thanks for answering anyways. much appreciated :)
[17:01:04] <robertmaxrees> randomguy1 wherew's the console log?
[17:01:12] <randomguy1> one sec...
[17:01:30] <robertmaxrees> also: console.log() isn't a reliable thing to check that sorta stuff. use a debugger if you want to watch execution in detail like that.
[17:01:41] <randomguy1> http://jsfiddle.net/95vaaxsL/9/
[17:01:44] <robertmaxrees> also: jquery events are handled differently from native events, so there's some funk there, too.
[17:12:17] <PlanC> Outage
[17:14:04] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[17:16:51] <PlanC> Connections are really fast in Sweden though
[17:16:53] <PlanC> I'm on 100/100
[17:16:56] <robertmaxrees> nice
[17:17:33] <robertmaxrees> we have a like 300/300 office line here.
[17:17:41] <robertmaxrees> or something like that.
[17:18:22] <PlanC> That's a really fast connection
[17:18:31] <PlanC> It's shared among everyone, right?
[17:18:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:18:46] <robertmaxrees> we also have like 500 people in the same building.
[17:19:58] <PlanC> 300/300 should be enough unless large files are being downloaded simultaneously
[17:20:15] <robertmaxrees> aye it's plenty.  most of the traffic is all internal network anyway.
[17:24:00] <robertmaxrees> anybody here have any experience with tom bihn bags?
[17:26:26] <PlanC> Never heard about them
[17:26:30] <PlanC> Need it for your laptop?
[17:26:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah trying to decide between two of their bags.  pretty sure i know what i want.
[17:27:03] <robertmaxrees> just looking to see if anybody else has any experience.
[17:27:18] <PlanC> Experience with what?  It's just regular bags, right?
[17:27:44] <robertmaxrees> they've got a modular setup and all kinds of crazy addons.
[17:28:20] <robertmaxrees> like i'm looking at one that takes a laptop sleeve that lets you slide everything out of the bag but keeps it attached.  makes things TSA-Friendly.
[17:29:16] <PlanC> Ah, that's pretty useful if you travel a lot
[17:30:04] <robertmaxrees> the bags don't have a lot of laptop protection so they kind of push you to get the hard shell or sleeve-style case.
[17:30:55] <PlanC> Are they pricey?
[17:32:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah a bit.
[17:33:48] <robertmaxrees> but after years of dealing with crappy bags i'm kind of ready to spring for something nice.
[17:35:13] <PlanC> I've never really liked working on laptops
[17:35:34] <PlanC> Isn't it hard to code on such a small screen/keyboard?
[17:35:39] <robertmaxrees> neither do I - our work gives us all setups to use full monitors/keyboards/mice.
[17:35:52] <robertmaxrees> the windows machines have a doc that makes that super easy.
[17:35:59] <robertmaxrees> *dock
[17:36:35] <PlanC> So you just connect your laptop to the monitors and you're good to go?
[17:37:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the dock has a bunch of usb and other ports so I leave my keyboard/mouse/monitors connected to it and dock it/undock it pretty easily.  we give our mac users stands and they use them as secondary monitors.
[17:39:21] <asidjazz> i use a hengedock w/ my 13" retina
[17:39:28] <asidjazz> http://hengedocks.com/pages/vertical-macbook-pro-retina
[17:39:33] <asidjazz> thign is awesome
[17:39:44] <robertmaxrees> hah nice
[17:40:12] <PlanC> Looks really nice
[17:40:18] <asidjazz> works well
[17:40:25] <asidjazz> just need to be careful inserting the laptop
[17:40:27] <asidjazz> cant toss it in
[17:40:39] <asidjazz> here ill take a pic
[17:41:54] <asidjazz> http://i.imgur.com/oBGL8J0.jpg
[17:42:05] <robertmaxrees> not bad.
[17:42:08] <asidjazz> my other client i have a 2monitor hengedock setup
[17:42:12] <asidjazz> here just 1
[17:42:23] <robertmaxrees> our folks like the stand because they use them a secondary monitors.
[17:42:28] <robertmaxrees> and a bit cheaper ;)
[17:42:37] <PlanC> Nice office!
[17:42:46] <asidjazz> id rather use external kb/nice
[17:42:51] <asidjazz> not wear my retinas kb down too much
[17:42:55] <PlanC> Is that coffee in a jar?
[17:42:58] <asidjazz> kb/trackpad
[17:43:02] <asidjazz> yea they use mason jars here PlanC
[17:43:05] <robertmaxrees> asidjazz our folks use external kb and mice, too.
[17:43:08] <asidjazz> and they have cold trip coffee on tap
[17:43:13] <asidjazz> really good coffee
[17:43:23] <asidjazz> robertmaxrees: i think its good for the laptop lifetime
[17:43:35] <NeoGeo> hi
[17:43:45] <asidjazz> cold drip*
[17:43:50] <PlanC> Is it common there or is it some kind of a hipster thing?
[17:43:53] <robertmaxrees> i dig the idea behind that stand. and we have the backing of a massive multinational company, so we can get away with buying basically whatever, whenever.
[17:44:02] <robertmaxrees> as far as computers, i mean.
[17:44:04] <asidjazz> PlanC: the cold drip not at all
[17:44:17] <PlanC> No, I mean the jar
[17:44:18] <asidjazz> PlanC: 1st i seen it here in SF, love it though cuz i love iced coffee
[17:44:19] <robertmaxrees> hello NeoGeo
[17:44:25] <asidjazz> the jar is common
[17:44:37] <asidjazz> another agency im at they have branded mason jar mugs
[17:44:38] <asidjazz> w/ handles
[17:44:42] <NeoGeo> robertmaxrees, can you help me
[17:44:47] <NeoGeo> with the jquery
[17:44:49] <asidjazz> typical sf hipster vibe PlanC
[17:44:53] <robertmaxrees> NeoGeo just ask your question.
[17:44:57] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[17:45:40] <PlanC> I actually lived in SF for two years
[17:45:50] <NeoGeo> I have a form, and sections w/in the form, if I wanted to make the entries for the field to be in inputs after you click a button, and the inputs have original values
[17:46:06] <NeoGeo> is it ghetto if I indivisually select each value and then put in an input
[17:46:19] <NeoGeo> or select all inputs that toggle, im having a hard time explain
[17:46:28] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:46:43] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and show us what you're doing.
[17:46:47] <asidjazz> depends neo, looping through form elements would kind of eatup more cpu
[17:46:53] <asidjazz> so an array you loop thorugh woudl be faster
[17:47:02] <asidjazz> depends how many inputs were talking
[17:47:13] <robertmaxrees> and what exactly you're doing.
[17:49:41] <NeoGeo> robertmaxrees, ok cool
[17:49:54] <NeoGeo> http://codepen.io/sodacrunch/pen/YXWvMK see how when I click the fird edit button, the pencil icon
[17:50:19] <NeoGeo> I want that sections values turned into inputs, I feel im doing it the wrong way
[17:50:40] <NeoGeo> it works but I can do it in more simple way
[17:50:45] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:50:51] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a very good test case fwiw.
[17:51:15] <NeoGeo> what does that mean
[17:51:48] <robertmaxrees> we don't need your header/footert/etc.  just an examle of the html/css.
[17:52:24] <robertmaxrees> either way, you should get the section and run a .find(':input').each(); and do your work in there instead.
[17:53:28] <robertmaxrees> you could also use contenteditable to do this instead.
[17:54:52] <NeoGeo> robertmaxrees, f yea, thanks man im going to check both of these out
[17:55:00] <NeoGeo> what my attempt sucky?
[17:55:16] <robertmaxrees> nah, you just need to learn the jquery api a bit better
[17:55:41] <NeoGeo> thanks man
[17:56:43] <PlanC> robertmaxrees: I've got a new problem: https://jsfiddle.net/L65175ap/6/
[17:56:53] <PlanC> This time I'm creating a div inside the append as well
[17:56:59] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:57:09] <robertmaxrees> $('#test').on('a click keydown contextmenu', 'a', function(e) { is wrong btw.
[17:57:30] <PlanC> https://jsfiddle.net/L65175ap/7/
[17:57:40] <PlanC> Removed the "a" although it worked with it as well
[17:57:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah but "a" isn't an event.
[17:57:50] <robertmaxrees> and this is easyt.
[17:57:55] <robertmaxrees> $('#test').on('click keydown contextmenu', 'a', function(e) {
[17:57:59] <robertmaxrees> but you're appending to #wrapper
[17:58:26] <PlanC> Yeah, I want to append the <div id='test'> to #wrapper
[17:58:31] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:58:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:58:43] <robertmaxrees> #test doesn't exist until after the call to .on()
[17:59:20] <PlanC> I figured, but I have no idea on how to go around that
[17:59:27] <robertmaxrees> $('#wrapper')
[18:00:00] <robertmaxrees> not $('#test')
[18:00:43] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events - it seems like a lot of reading, but it really isn't.
[18:01:17] <PlanC> That works for this example, but in my other code I have #wrapper created through an append as well
[18:01:27] <robertmaxrees> then bind a level higher.
[18:01:58] <robertmaxrees> read the documentation.
[18:02:01] <robertmaxrees> it explains it.  i promise.
[18:03:19] <PlanC> You're advice helped me again
[18:03:34] <PlanC> I had to bind it to the first div that wasn't created through an append
[18:03:34] <robertmaxrees> great! so you read the documentation?
[18:03:41] <PlanC> Thanks again, I'll go read the docs now
[18:03:46] <robertmaxrees> awesome :)
[18:21:53] <adv_>  $('#wheelzoom').on('DOMMouseScroll mousewheel', function (e) { //  i have this and i'm invoking it for every page turn , but it doesn't always work . i have a console.log inside to debug and it doesn't get printed every time. any ideas on why this is happpening?
[18:26:04] <ehlovader> Good evening... anyone here familiar with pickmeup datepicker?
[18:26:25] <ehlovader> trying to get it working with bootstrap, thought I found the cause, the css method of jQuery not pulling the calculated style in a newborn dom element
[18:27:12] <ehlovader> trying to append to the dom before reading them. They work locally but I cannot produce a working jsfiddle with external resources... only if I copy paste the js content into the javascript there
[18:27:25] <ehlovader> anyone able to look at this to see if I am missing something?
[18:27:32] <ehlovader> https://jsfiddle.net/ngnykw3n/ is the copy pasta version it works
[18:27:47] <ehlovader> when I pull that out to an external file https://jsfiddle.net/ngnykw3n/8/
[18:27:48] <ehlovader> it fails
[18:41:24] <Lencl> hmm
[18:41:57] <Lencl> I have this statement: $('li.word').on('click',testFunc);   and this statement:     $('li.word').on('click',function() { console.log('test"});
[18:42:28] <Lencl> the second statement works... the first statement is var testFunc = function(e) { console.log('test');};  does not work
[18:42:36] <Lencl> is that a binding issue?
[18:45:12] <shoky> it's not an issue with the little code you showed
[18:45:20] <Mr_Moon> could be wrong... but...
[18:45:23] <shoky> those should be doing the same
[18:45:47] <Mr_Moon> shouldn't it be $('li.word').on('click',testFunc()); ?
[18:45:52] <shoky> no
[18:46:15] <Mr_Moon> heh then I am wrong ;)
[18:46:45] <shoky> that was always a possiblity ;p
[18:47:11] <ehlovader> I am thinking they should be the same, yes...
[18:47:39] <shoky> unless testFunc isn't in scope or something else like that that you haven't showed
[18:51:41] <Lencl> shoky, yes it's definitely not an issue but when it's put on my script, it's giving issues
[18:51:56] <Lencl> so theoretically, could this be a binding issue problem ?
[18:52:07] <Lencl> because it gives no errors
[18:55:22] <shoky> it can be many kinds of problems... sure why not, binding issue problem
[18:55:58] <Lencl> hmm
[18:56:45] <shoky> reproduce your issue in a jsfiddle and someone can probably help
[18:57:19] <shoky> g'night
[18:57:42] <Mr_Moon> Lencl - I just tried $('li.word').on("click",function() { testFunc();  });
[18:57:44] <Mr_Moon> and that works
[18:58:21] <Lencl> ah I found the issue
[18:58:27] <Lencl> http://jsfiddle.net/p9h7qfoq/
[18:58:39] <Lencl> it's because I have it wrapped with another function
[18:59:03] <Lencl> the defClicked does not work when it's wrapped around the function
[18:59:40] <Mr_Moon> it does if you write it the way I did it up there ^^^
[18:59:40] <Lencl> but how could I work around that?
[18:59:47] <Lencl> ah
[18:59:54] <Mr_Moon> http://jsfiddle.net/rdzychuu/
[19:00:02] <Mr_Moon> (forked from yours)
[19:00:08] <Lencl> you're right
[19:00:13] <Lencl> thank you
[19:00:17] <Lencl> but why is this the case?
[19:00:28] <Mr_Moon> no probs :) easy enough. And makes me feel better about being told I was wrong ;)
[19:01:33] <Mr_Moon> buggered if I know TBH - but I"m a bit of a noob I guess ;)
[19:02:23] <Lencl> you deserve to be promoted
[19:02:31] <Mr_Moon> lol thanks :)
[19:03:15] <Mr_Moon> Just nice to be able to give a bit back to the community every now and again :)
[19:23:34] <PlanC> I have a <input type="text" id="test"> that I am retrieving values from when a <button id="submit">Send</button> is pressed
[19:23:48] <PlanC> Everything is working fine, but it seems as though the input history isn't being saved
[19:24:19] <PlanC> Will I have to add it inside a <form> in order to have the browser store the history of the input box?
[19:28:43] <R-Ratones> the button tag is outside the form? that shouldnt be a problem
[19:32:14] <PlanC> There isn't a form a though
[19:33:46] <R-Ratones> you can set the hash fragment (domain/path?query#hash) on the onclick event of the submit button and update the input value from there
[19:48:43] <NeoGeo> sup Mr_Moon
[19:50:16] <Mr_Moon> Hi NeoGeo
[20:10:43] <NeoGeo> Mr_Moon, what are you doing
[20:11:33] <Mr_Moon> NeoGeo mostly working, but solving the world's front end problems one question at a time ;) How bout you?
[20:12:12] <snover> Mr_Moon: what are you wearing
[20:12:34] <NeoGeo> Mr_Moon, i just hit a dutchmaster
[20:13:06] <Mr_Moon> snover - jandals.
[20:13:15] <Mr_Moon> NeoGeo - what the hell is a dutchmaster?
[20:13:33] <Mr_Moon> oh wait... got it
[20:13:44] <Mr_Moon> That's... uh.... fascinating?
[20:13:51] <NeoGeo> Mr_Moon, you ever played neo geo the arcade or console in your life
[20:15:02] <Mr_Moon> uuuuhhhhhh via Mame I think?
[20:15:04] <Mr_Moon> why's that?
[20:15:42] <NeoGeo>                         
[20:15:42] <NeoGeo>              means you are a 90's baby
[20:15:54] <Mr_Moon> *cough* not quite, no
[20:16:18] <Mr_Moon> just a c64 baby ;)
[20:17:14] <NeoGeo> oh shiii

[20:38:39] <devt204> I'm trying to replace a content dynamically on my WordPress Site, I've countdown plugin installed, now what I'm trying to do is : when countdown reaches 00:00:00 the text above should dynamically update, is it possible ?
[21:15:44] <pauled> I am trying to run pietimer in jsfiddle but does not seems to works, something wrong http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/yupnwtrm/
[21:21:38] <pauled> there is countdown possible without a plugin?
[21:22:05] <Mr_Moon> I took a quick look pauled - but can't see anything seriously wrong?
[21:23:06] <pauled> yeah strange, something wrong with jsfiddle and his wrapper
[21:24:30] <Mr_Moon> you've tried it outside of jsfiddle?
[21:26:08] <Mr_Moon> my console is telling me .pietimer() is not a function...??
[21:27:15] <pauled> not tried outside
[21:27:30] <pauled> I am looking other timer

[21:29:18] <Mr_Moon> pauled - that code DOES work. I just dloaded it and checked it out locally and its looking good.
[21:29:30] <Mr_Moon> something odd about chucking it in jsfiddle.
[21:30:18] <pauled> now I see why, getting this message in console: "Refused to execute script from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chikamichi/jquery.pietimer/master/jquery.pietimer.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled."

[22:00:44] <mrtAkdeniz> just click "kaydet" robertmaxrees
[22:01:05] <robertmaxrees> these look like they require a login of some kind.
[22:01:16] <robertmaxrees> just share the stringified data.
[22:01:20] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle or something.
[22:01:31] <mrtAkdeniz> ok wait for it robertmaxrees
[22:01:39] <mrtAkdeniz> oh wait
[22:01:52] <mrtAkdeniz> u can use : username : mrtakdeniz, password : merdakdeniz robertmaxrees
[22:02:02] <robertmaxrees> please put the data in a fiddle.
[22:02:02] <robertmaxrees> thx
[22:02:09] <mrtAkdeniz> ok robertmaxrees :(
[22:03:27] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, just want to see stringified data?
[22:03:34] <robertmaxrees> yes
[22:04:05] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, here you go https://jsfiddle.net/mbmfrmdx/
[22:04:24] <robertmaxrees> awesome!  so you want to access data out of this object?
[22:05:19] <mrtAkdeniz> i want to access values of "data" array robertmaxrees
[22:05:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mbmfrmdx/2/
[22:05:29] <robertmaxrees> [retty easy\
[22:05:36] <robertmaxrees> err, *pretty easy
[22:07:15] <mrtAkdeniz> it returns undefined robertmaxrees
[22:07:25] <robertmaxrees> don't stringify it.
[22:07:33] <robertmaxrees> just addess the data property of the object.
[22:07:44] <mrtAkdeniz> i updated my code robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/mbmfrmdx/3/
[22:08:03] <robertmaxrees> right, don't use stringify.
[22:08:11] <mrtAkdeniz> what you mean by data property?
[22:08:12] <robertmaxrees> that makes it a string.  then you can't access the properties of it.
[22:08:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mbmfrmdx/2/ go here and open your console.
[22:08:23] <robertmaxrees> see what happens?
[22:09:05] <mrtAkdeniz> yeah robertmaxrees it returns an object?
[22:09:18] <robertmaxrees> right.  that's what you wnat.
[22:09:21] <mrtAkdeniz> i can get values by myData.data.username
[22:09:23] <robertmaxrees> don't use JSON.stringify()
[22:09:24] <mrtAkdeniz> i want all values
[22:09:37] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what "i want all values" means.
[22:09:46] <mrtAkdeniz> hmm..
[22:09:50] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, wait for it
[22:10:10] <robertmaxrees> can you give an example of what you want the end result to look like?
[22:10:20] <mrtAkdeniz> i mean value of myData.data.username, myData.data.name
[22:10:27] <mrtAkdeniz> ok wait for it
[22:11:58] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/7kwh85s6/2/
[22:12:01] <mrtAkdeniz> here is what i want
[22:12:46] <mrtAkdeniz> but i don't want to specify every key manuel, because it is an validation form, and i don't know which of them will empty etc
[22:12:53] <robertmaxrees> oooooh.
[22:12:56] <robertmaxrees> i get what you're saying.
[22:13:17] <robertmaxrees> there are a few different ways to do this.
[22:13:28] <robertmaxrees> what sort of browser support do you need?
[22:13:56] <mrtAkdeniz> hmm, only chrome and firefox is enough i think, but if i need to do more for webkit, only chrome is ok :)
[22:14:09] <robertmaxrees> IE is actually the problem here, but OK.
[22:14:10] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[22:15:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7kwh85s6/3/ this is one way
[22:15:39] <mrtAkdeniz> actually, if you tell me how to call a function from inside of the page, i can do it with php loop robertmaxrees
[22:16:04] <robertmaxrees> no clue yo.  i don't know php
[22:16:17] <robertmaxrees> but i just showed you a javascript way
[22:16:32] <mrtAkdeniz> yes robertmaxrees let me try it
[22:16:44] <mrtAkdeniz> no robertmaxrees i'm not asking about php :)
[22:17:27] <mrtAkdeniz> i'm showing these errors with php already, but i want to use a jquery plugin, that's why if i learn how to call js function inside of a page without click or change sth
[22:17:27] <robertmaxrees> "actually, if you tell me how to call a function from inside of the page, i can do it with php loop robertmaxrees" - you can't call php code with javascript, then.
[22:17:31] <robertmaxrees> they live in two different places.
[22:17:43] <mrtAkdeniz> i want to call javascript with php :)
[22:18:01] <mrtAkdeniz> i mean want to call function from if statement of php
[22:18:03] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that.
[22:18:09] <mrtAkdeniz> oh i tought so :(
[22:18:17] <robertmaxrees> they live in completely different places.
[22:18:17] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, let me rewrite my code like you show :)
[22:23:02] <pauled> TimeCircles examples: http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/4mrmLwy0/ :)
[22:23:16] <robertmaxrees> woah
[22:23:23] <robertmaxrees> pauled that page is broken.
[22:23:32] <robertmaxrees> also - jsfiddle already includes the body tag for you.
[22:23:56] <pauled> robertmaxrees: no, you have to enlarge the result page
[22:24:12] <robertmaxrees> pauled also, you don't need to manually include the bootstrap css.
[22:24:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4mrmLwy0/1/
[22:24:33] <pauled> ah ? i didn't know that
[22:26:02] <robertmaxrees> also, this isn't really a good example of a use case for a fiddle :)
[22:29:19] <pauled> why, it's a good exemple of use, not only for debugging code but also to show some example of code.
[22:30:03] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle is great for small test cases.
[22:31:03] <pauled> true, here is TimeCircles as small test case ;) https://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/4mrmLwy0/embedded/result/
[22:31:16] <robertmaxrees> hurr
[22:33:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4mrmLwy0/3/
[22:33:27] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[22:33:29] <`devop> hi, how can i 'predict' an element that will create in the future, and add an action when it creates???
[22:33:38] <robertmaxrees> `devop huh?
[22:33:49] <robertmaxrees> `devop you mean an event listener?
[22:33:55] <`devop> robertmaxrees: lets say i have button that creates divs...
[22:34:06] <`devop> when div is created i want to perform an action on it
[22:34:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to do that within the code that creaates the divs.
[22:35:45] <nikitabanthiya14>  hey how can I made gauge from javascript and html? please help me
[22:36:58] <robertmaxrees> nikitabanthiya14 https://github.com/Mikhus/canv-gauge
[22:40:04] <nikitabanthiya14> robertmaxrees : hey please tell me this guage and gauge from c3 d3 library is almost same? because they said me to made gauge purely from javascript and html?
[22:40:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:40:58] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what all of those thijngs have to do with each other.
[22:40:59] <nikitabanthiya14> means i want to made gauge by javascript and html only ,
[22:41:14] <robertmaxrees> why?
[22:41:33] <robertmaxrees> and can you use canvas?  what about jquery?
[22:41:40] <robertmaxrees> i assume you need css, too.
[22:41:56] <nikitabanthiya14> did u get my point? because they assigned me to do it in javascript and html and ya ofcourse css to
[22:42:16] <nikitabanthiya14> no jquery
[22:42:20] <nikitabanthiya14> i dont know what is canvas?
[22:42:28] <robertmaxrees> pop over to #javascript.
[22:42:34] <robertmaxrees> err, ##javascript.
[22:42:42] <robertmaxrees> they'll be able to helpy ou more there.
[22:42:54] <nikitabanthiya14> i ping there but no one helped me :/
[22:43:11] <robertmaxrees> you can't use jquery
[22:43:24] <robertmaxrees> that kind of makes this room not an option :)
[22:43:25] <nikitabanthiya14> ya i cant use jquery :/
[22:44:17] <nikitabanthiya14> what is canvas ?
[22:44:30] <robertmaxrees> search google for HTML Canvas.
[22:44:42] <nikitabanthiya14> ok
[22:44:49] <nikitabanthiya14> thanx
[22:52:54] <mrtAkdeniz> where is wrong with this code : http://jsfiddle.net/mrtakdeniz/5euh0cmk/3/
[22:53:01] <mrtAkdeniz> it always say, function is not defined!
[22:53:18] <robertmaxrees> becauyse growlError isn't defined...
[22:53:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5euh0cmk/4/ call it like this.
[22:53:59] <robertmaxrees> not in your html.
[22:57:13] <mrtAkdeniz> no way to call it from html robertmaxrees ?
[22:57:20] <robertmaxrees> you can, but it's not a good idea.
[22:57:46] <mrtAkdeniz> but i've to ?
[22:57:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?  why?
[22:58:06] <mrtAkdeniz> because i need to trigger it with php if statement
[22:58:11] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[22:58:13] <robertmaxrees> use javascript.
[22:58:24] <mrtAkdeniz> ok forget it, i'm going to move my php block to footer, where i call my functions :3
[22:58:33] <robertmaxrees> please don't do that.
[22:58:50] <mrtAkdeniz> but otherwise, i need to post my data with javascript or jquery
[22:58:51] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea - generating javascript code like that is a really bad idea.
[22:58:59] <mrtAkdeniz> and i don't want to do that..
[22:59:03] <robertmaxrees> then post it.  or send the validation rules to the client side.
[22:59:20] <mrtAkdeniz> is it safe to post data with javascript?
[22:59:32] <robertmaxrees> yes,  as long as you sanitize, you're fine.
[23:00:02] <pauled> robertmaxrees: ;) http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/4mrmLwy0/4/
[23:00:06] <mrtAkdeniz> is there a way to sanitize you can prefer?
[23:00:24] <robertmaxrees> i don't work with PHP, so I don't have any suggestions for that particular platform.
[23:01:24] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I didn't found how to use .end().fadeOut();
[23:01:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[23:01:57] <mrtAkdeniz> oh i got it robertmaxrees, sanitize data with php :3
[23:02:11] <mrtAkdeniz> i tought u are telling about client side
[23:02:15] <robertmaxrees> mrtAkdeniz right.  people can modify the javascript.  never trust your input.
[23:02:45] <robertmaxrees> you should be validating server-side as well.  exposing an api for that would be best.
[23:02:57] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, thank you so much :)
[23:03:36] <robertmaxrees> pauled you're aware what .end() does, right?
[23:04:44] <pauled> I guess it trigger fadeOut when it's time out?
[23:04:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[23:05:29] <robertmaxrees> it removes the current filter and goes back to the original selector.
[23:07:02] <robertmaxrees> and with that, good night folks.
[23:07:14] <pauled> let me google how to fadeOut
[23:07:25] <pauled> good night rober
[23:48:57] <pauled> chrome crashed ^^ http://i.imgur.com/lLMC6km.png
[23:49:23] <pauled> too many tab
[23:50:46] <pauled> I lost my jquery session ;(
[23:51:11] <Mr_Moon> Chrome can be suuuuuch a memory hog!
[23:53:55] <pauled> omg I lost all my cached jsfiddle :(
[23:54:25] <Mr_Moon> Uh oh! Benefit to saving them as you go!
[23:58:03] <pauled> I hate chrome but there are few extensions that I can't find in firefox
[23:58:33] <Nasp> Stop openning 200 tabs then
[23:59:37] <Uhkis> yeah, better blame user for browsers shortcomings
[23:59:41] <pauled> was not 200 tabs, maybe ~50 but not 200. and the tab are supposed unloaded
