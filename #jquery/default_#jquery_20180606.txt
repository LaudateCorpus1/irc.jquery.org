[00:56:38] <Rhaal> Greetings! I can't seem to make any CORS through $.getJSON
[00:57:03] <Rhaal> I've tried adding a callback, that only moved the problem to a "Wrong MIME type"
[02:46:40] <inthl> I am wasting the about 4 past hours on some `little` issue here I am having, I simply can not get it right
[02:47:23] <inthl> I have a datatable here, with rowgroup enabled. there is a link in every row in the grouped rows. Now I want to add another row in that group - at the end of the group
[02:48:35] <inthl> I am unable to determine on what index to put it on, because I fail to count the elements in the current group
[02:55:06] <inthl> http://jsfiddle.net/mLh08nyg/431/ I am using a similar example like this one
[02:55:17] <inthl> it adds the rows on top. but I would need it at the end of the rowgroupo
[03:27:45] <inthl> uhm well forget my initial question, there is another issue which would cause my intention to fail anyway
[03:27:48] <inthl> please look at this:
[03:27:51] <inthl> https://cdn.uni-kl.de/js/datatables/latest/extensions/RowGroup/examples/initialisation/startAndEndRender.html
[03:28:25] <inthl> you can see an example there that does something unexpected. it shows the average for the rows in the group, e.g. Average salary in London: $90,560
[03:28:38] <inthl> now scroll to page 2, it says Average salary in London: $314,520
[03:29:09] <inthl> apparently this calculation works only on displayed rows ... how could one make it apply for all rows, regardless of whether shown or not?
[03:59:13] <AdamPDotty> Quite imaginable that you have to give overall averages as extra values somewhere. As I understand it only the shown rows are in the current resultset. So the plugin can not iterate over data unknown to it.
[06:36:42] <jak2000> hi all
[06:36:54] <jak2000> any lugin that recommend me (progressbar)?
[06:36:59] <jak2000> infinite progressbar?
[06:38:17] <thykka> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress
[06:38:28] <thykka> no need for a plugin :]
[06:43:01] <jak2000> mmmm how to do a infinite loop? and show any animation?
[06:48:15] <jak2000> thykka any adcive?
[06:48:46] <thykka> while (true) { ... }
[06:48:48] <thykka> ;)
[06:53:40] <thykka> jak2000, https://jsfiddle.net/w6h5n3a2/2/
[06:54:28] <thykka> there's no "infinite loop" because a progress bar is meant to indicate progress
[07:10:51] <thykka> jak2000, here's a CSS-only infinite loop progress bar: https://jsfiddle.net/hs67f8ed/13/
[08:38:48] <cannap> he is there a better way to write this https://paste.laravel.io/2dcdf3fe-7805-4679-a3d1-54dc971861a2
[08:39:48] <Woet> cannap: define better.
[08:40:14] <cannap> i dont know its jquery^^
[08:40:17] <cannap> but its looks damn ugly
[08:41:34] <MikeD_> cannap: what do you want it to look like?
[08:41:50] <cannap> i dont know ^^
[08:41:57] <cannap> less code do more! :P
[08:42:28] <Woet> cannap: https://paste.laravel.io/5e5d8016-1120-4be8-aea7-dafdefa4ef71
[08:42:30] <Woet> there you go
[08:42:35] <MikeD_> instead of walking around the dom trying to find a somewhat arbitrary image tag, you could have used id if the source had id
[08:42:52] <cannap> yea i will change something
[08:42:54] <cannap> thanks
[08:43:12] <cannap> i noticed the image is too small so i will add one via data-attribute and the resolve it with an id
[08:44:28] <MikeD_> depending on the dom, you might have used .siblings() instead of parent+find
[08:53:03] <cannap> i fixed const image = $(this).data('image') :P
[08:53:18] <MikeD_> def. less ugly
[09:28:46] <_jan> hi jquery won't react on click event https://paste.debian.net/1028204/
[09:34:19] <AdamPDotty> `live
[09:43:36] <cannap> juhu what ever i made it works https://www.useloom.com/share/ac6ec18377c247bf9e43241f22d6af32 :D
[09:46:45] <AdamPDotty> !next
[09:47:53] <cannap>   $( document).on( "click", "#pwchangeform", function... @_jan
[09:48:17] <cannap> or it was $( document).on(  "#pwchangeform","click",function... @_jan
[09:48:20] <cannap> i forgot which order
[09:49:00] <AdamPDotty> oops yes
[09:49:04] <_jan> cannap: yes that isn't working
[09:49:04] <AdamPDotty> first version
[09:49:19] <AdamPDotty> yet another holiday …
[09:49:27] <cannap> i dont see where you use it
[09:49:33] <cannap> i just see $( "#pwchangeform" ).on( "click", function( event ) {
[09:49:59] <cannap> check the difference $( document).on( "click", "#pwchangeform", function... @_jan
[09:51:31] <_jan> thanks that's works
[15:15:07] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeee
[15:56:10] <daveee123> i am looking to reload information in this function. i have a function that runs on click, but I am not sure how to have it run this function again:
[15:56:13] <daveee123> var jqxhr = $.ajax('/classes/{{ class_.id }}/' + name).done(function () { ALL THE STUFF IN HERE
[15:56:13] <daveee123> })
[15:57:52] <robertmaxrees> wrap that ajax call in a function.,
[15:58:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/nxvryuab/
[15:59:52] <robertmaxrees> daveee123
[16:00:01] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: thank you!
[16:04:02] <robertmaxrees> rad
[17:29:41] <robertmaxrees> welp
[17:54:06] <Levin^> hello
[17:54:27] <Levin^> how do I write a selector backwards?
[17:54:52] <Levin^> eg $(#x < span)
[17:54:56] <Levin^> is that possible?
[17:56:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:56:46] <robertmaxrees> why would you "write a selector backwards"?
[17:57:22] <daveee123> i cannot figure out how to parse the ajax responseText. So far i have this:
[17:57:48] <robertmaxrees> Levin^
[17:58:00] <daveee123> https://pastebin.com/HhNmcDzk
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> daveee123 so what's the issue?
[17:58:38] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: I found a funny way of doing it
[17:58:38] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/WyGwOP
[17:59:02] <Levin^> using siblings()
[17:59:19] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ huh?
[17:59:20] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: i see in the inspector tool on chrome that the url is visited at that a json is in the response, but for some reason it is not actually parsed on the line that starts with data =
[17:59:37] <Levin^> I have an element without a class or ID
[17:59:42] <robertmaxrees> daveee123 well for starters, manual_ajax_dt is a function
[17:59:49] <robertmaxrees> daveee123 you want the response
[17:59:52] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: yes, not sure what is supposed to go there
[17:59:55] <robertmaxrees> console.log(response)
[18:00:07] <robertmaxrees> since you have function(response) {
[18:00:28] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ okay?  then give it a class?
[18:01:03] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: yes. i tried response, and response.responseText didn't work. didn't think of just response. that did it!
[18:01:46] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: no parsing needing. thanks again for the help!
[18:01:47] <robertmaxrees> daveee123 fwiw you can probably kill the dataType: "json" out of the options
[18:01:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:01:56] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:02:07] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: got it
[18:02:14] <robertmaxrees> though I'm confused about why you were trying to read the responseText property on the function,.
[18:02:15] <robertmaxrees> seems odd.
[18:02:45] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: it's all good now, thanks ^^'
[18:02:50] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[18:03:12] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: copy and pasting someone else's code while having no idea how it worked. i was confused by it too...
[18:03:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:03:21] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[21:50:18] <inthl> $('.' + foo).parents('bar').each() ...parses every bar with .foo as class in its children. now how would I revert this, by starting not with the first, but $('.' + foo).parents('bar').reverse().each() or $('.' + foo).reverse().parents('bar').each() ..does not work for me, any ideas why?
[23:15:34] <linurandy> hello to everyone i'm trying to run that but i can't i think is 'cause div.notes_delete doesn't have been creted yet. How could I fix it. This is my code: https://dpaste.de/z2hh
