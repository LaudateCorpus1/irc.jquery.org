[06:11:54] <Barrt> Anyone around that may be able to help in something?
[06:44:22] <shoky> not if you don't ask an actual question
[08:23:18] <Cork> shoky: don't put forth such unreasonable demands! use your psychic powers!
[08:24:45] <shoky> ;]
[09:13:33] <Uhkis> :D
[10:37:10] <Barrt> Hey so I have a form  with which I'm using jQuery steps and jQuery validation
[10:37:20] <Barrt> And on the example code
[10:37:52] <Barrt> To select the form to pass to jQuery steps I do't have to specify the elements
[10:38:13] <Barrt> On mine only works if I specify the children elements
[10:38:17] <Barrt> Example
[10:38:58] <Barrt> On the one that works properly is selected like this   $("#signup-form").steps({
[10:39:27] <Barrt> Mine only works with $("#signup-form").children("div").steps({
[10:39:51] <Barrt> And this doesn't let me do the validation properly, I assume...
[10:40:01] <Barrt> Can anyone help me with this
[10:40:03] <Barrt> ?
[11:51:22] * cloud69 trying to build a "Tinder for corona patients"
[12:42:32] <robertmaxrees> cloud69 cool (?)
[12:42:56] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: thx :P
[12:43:00] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: what do you think: https://jsfiddle.net/askhflajsf/nmokzgqw/6/
[12:43:33] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: not sure what that has to do with this channel but alrighty :)
[13:11:35] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: this code could probably look a LOT simpler and more beautiful with jquery right?
[13:11:44] <cloud69> i've decided to try to do so
[13:11:52] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:11:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:11:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:12:19] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.  most of it would look about the same.
[13:13:01] <robertmaxrees> is there a problem with the code so far?
[13:13:43] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: https://medium.com/@simonepm/build-a-full-featured-tinder-like-carousel-in-vanilla-javascript-part-i-44ca3a906450
[13:14:00] <cloud69> well #1 i didn't write it so i dont know whats going on
[13:14:14] <cloud69> #2 i think jquery is prettier and easier to understand than vanilla js
[13:14:23] <robertmaxrees> then learn?  using jquery won't preclude you from having to understand the underlying js.
[13:14:35] <robertmaxrees> in fact, a lot of what's there you'll have to basically use anyway
[13:16:35] <cloud69> i thought this was #jquery :P
[13:16:47] <robertmaxrees> it is.  what does that have to do with anything?
[13:16:48] <cloud69> not #meh-2020-why-are-we-still-here :P
[13:16:59] <robertmaxrees> where did i say that?
[13:17:08] <cloud69> i came here for moral support :/
[13:17:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:17:30] <robertmaxrees> just being realistic - rewriting it using jquery won't really solve any problems :)
[14:54:11] <grid_> hey
[14:54:42] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[14:57:32] <robertmaxrees> well, not technically afternoon yet hahaha
[15:17:48] <grid_> hehe
[15:19:56] <robertmaxrees> how can we help you grid_?
[15:55:41] <grid_> robertmaxrees: no topic to discuss about i'm afraid :)
[15:56:01] <robertmaxrees> ah.  gotcha.
[16:31:17] <mafuzzy_chef> hi.. i have a question
[16:35:56] <mafuzzy_chef> hi. i'm using a base color of white but in the render it still has the default grey color look to itanyone know what i could be doing wrong
[16:37:17] <robertmaxrees> mafuzzy_chef can you show us what you mean?
[16:47:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:18:34] <cloud69> Hello!
[18:18:40] <robertmaxrees> hello
[18:24:06] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: trying to rewrite https://medium.com/@simonepm/build-a-full-featured-tinder-like-carousel-in-vanilla-javascript-part-i-44ca3a906450 in jquery
[18:24:12] <cloud69> but haven't touched jquery in years and im also unsure about the logic
[18:24:16] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:24:24] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you'll recycle most of what's there.
[18:24:34] <cloud69> am i on the right path: https://jsfiddle.net/askhflajsf/nmokzgqw/12/
[18:26:25] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno - that's an incomplete, invalid example so i'm not really sure.
[18:27:41] <cloud69> but you can at least see what i mean by simplifying right?
[18:27:43] <robertmaxrees> last i checked you can't just link directly from github for some browsers since it doesn't have the right headers.
[18:28:15] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm confused by what you mean by "simplifying" :)
[18:28:43] <cloud69> true
[18:28:50] <cloud69> yeah me too im confused what you mean by recycling
[18:29:04] <robertmaxrees> as in you'll use most of the same code.
[18:29:08] <cloud69> simplifying the syntax, keeping the logic, is my goal
[18:29:19] <cloud69> no i intend to cut out most of the code, turn 1000 lines into 10
[18:29:27] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:29:37] <cloud69> without adding unnecessary complexity, other than the abstraction layer that is jquery
[18:29:45] <cloud69> "make it as simple as possible, but not any simpler"
[18:29:50] <robertmaxrees> so what functionality are you getting rid of then?
[18:29:55] <cloud69> "perfection is achieved, not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to take away"
[18:29:56] <robertmaxrees> and why do you care about lines of code?
[18:30:17] <cloud69> i think now we're just arguing for the sake of arguing
[18:30:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm not.
[18:30:23] <cloud69> that's like asking "why do you care about beautiful code"
[18:31:28] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: that's not what i'm trying to say at all lol.
[18:32:33] <robertmaxrees> looking at the article you linked, jquery won't really save you much effort.
[20:09:31] <rbo> Hi all, I am trying to use jQuery.find() but it never locates the div properly. here is the code https://pastebin.com/sEnUzcMY any clue why ".black" never gets located? same with rehash-counter.
[20:10:16] <robertmaxrees> rbo says that page isn't available?
[20:10:57] <rbo> https://pastebin.com/1QtmhPEr
[20:11:04] <rbo> what
[20:11:05] <rbo> oops
[20:11:09] <robertmaxrees> heh...
[20:11:18] <robertmaxrees> could always use jsfiddle instead :)
[20:11:37] <rbo> https://pastebin.com/ePJei9ET
[20:11:58] <robertmaxrees> without the html it's hard to help.
[20:12:28] <rbo> gotcha...
[20:12:43] <robertmaxrees> .find() looks at descendents of an element.
[20:12:59] <robertmaxrees> going to guess .rehash-counter isn't a descendent of .rehash-btn?
[20:13:18] <rbo> not at all. different div
[20:13:29] <robertmaxrees> so there's for first issue.
[20:13:38] <robertmaxrees> *your first issue.
[20:14:14] <robertmaxrees> also, you said $(".black") doesn't "get located"?  could you clarify what you mean by that?  have you tried console.log($(".black").length);?
[20:15:35] <rbo> yes it picks it up inside of developer editor (chrome)
[20:15:55] <rbo> but never picks it up inside the script.
[20:16:14] <robertmaxrees> which part of the script?  the post?
[20:16:31] <rbo> so you're saying, better to define the vars outside of $(document).on('click') ...
[20:16:41] <robertmaxrees> not saying that at all :)
[20:16:50] <rbo> neither of them work. the only thing that works is "Click detected"
[20:16:53] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your html, i can't really suggest what the fixes might be.
[20:17:08] <rbo> ok one sec
[20:17:37] <robertmaxrees> and set up a test case using https://jsfiddle.net/ - it's fine if the $.post() doesn't work.
[20:19:27] <rbo> https://gist.github.com/zrsm/9af7b86272fdab3b31de585178ff9cfa
[20:19:38] <rbo> ok I should probably be using jsfiddle more anyways.
[20:19:44] <rbo> probably a lot easier to troubleshoot. lol
[20:19:48] <robertmaxrees> also a lot of other issues.
[20:19:51] <robertmaxrees> that's invalid HTML./
[20:19:54] <robertmaxrees> left and right
[20:20:16] <robertmaxrees> the only direct descendent you can have of a <ul> is <li>, and you can't put <div> inside of <span>
[20:20:26] <robertmaxrees> so part of the issue is the browser doesn't know how to work with your html/
[20:20:38] <rbo> sure I know that, I can fix that, its a mess.
[20:20:44] <rbo> ok got it, so it is some html issues.
[20:20:53] <robertmaxrees> those aren't helping, at least.
[20:20:54] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:21:16] <robertmaxrees> what other library/framework is at play here?
[20:21:46] <rbo> bootstrap
[20:21:51] <robertmaxrees> which version?
[20:21:59] <rbo> font-awesome also.
[20:22:37] <robertmaxrees> gonna guess that $('.test').css() call isn't working either :)
[20:22:43] <rbo> nope not at all.
[20:22:50] <rbo> it just isn't selecting anything.
[20:22:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:22:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, open your dev tools and click the link.
[20:23:01] <rbo> i'll work on it :)
[20:23:16] <robertmaxrees> var count = $counter.text(); is throwing an error.
[20:23:21] <robertmaxrees> which is causing everything else to fail.
[20:23:28] <rbo> ah
[20:23:45] <rbo> omg
[20:23:46] <rbo> duh
[20:24:06] <robertmaxrees> :) keep your dev tools open and you'll catch this stuff pretty quickly.
[20:27:29] <rbo> robertmaxrees, ok yes thats what it was.
[20:27:54] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, that, plus fixing your markup will both make this much easier to work with :)
[20:31:31] <rbo> right, lol thank you!
