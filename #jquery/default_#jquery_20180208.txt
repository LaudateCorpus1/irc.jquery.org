[03:47:50] <maja> any one know a html way i can set datePicker options?
[03:48:32] <Duikb00t> input type="data"
[03:48:35] <Duikb00t> date*
[03:49:02] <maja> Duikb00t: i wish i gotta support IE :(
[03:49:17] <maja> IE don't support that *****!
[03:50:00] <Woet> maja: why do you need a HTML way?
[03:58:10] <maja> Woet: because the datepicker is used many places and i need to set a min and max on this one only
[03:58:43] <Woet> maja: so write 2 lines of JS code that checks for html data elements?
[03:59:37] <maja> Woet: easy enough i guess though would of rather not html date is so much better i wish IE would just die !
[04:04:38] <undefined_bob> I wish that too
[04:04:39] <Cork> maja: you could do <input data-date-picker="{<options>}"> and then $('input').each(function() { $(this).datePicker($(this).data('date-picker')) })
[04:05:25] <maja> undefined_bob: or just catch the fuck up to the rest of the world !
[04:05:42] <maja> Cork: and i could add that any where ?
[04:05:49] <Cork> sure
[04:05:55] <maja> i am having problems finding exactly where .datepicker is applied
[04:06:02] <Cork> ah
[04:06:10] <Cork> ya, you have to modify that code
[04:07:00] <maja> a bit but its a start !
[04:07:03] <maja> danki :)
[06:50:51] <devi8> can you break out of a filter loop?

[08:26:15] <lissitzki> hi
[08:26:39] <devi8> hey
[08:26:57] <lissitzki> i'm workin on this menu
[08:26:59] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/
[08:27:11] <lissitzki> but my method are not correct
[08:27:33] <lissitzki> the idea is to show one submenu at the time
[08:27:54] <lissitzki> as you can see is not wirking well
[08:28:29] <devi8> You can do this without any js (or with very little js
[08:28:47] <lissitzki> how?
[08:29:00] <devi8> gimme just a second ill show you
[08:35:12] <devi8> here is your menu (truncated) that shows how it can be done with just css
[08:35:31] <devi8> when you hover over one of the anchor elements, it reveals the submenu
[08:41:22] <lissitzki> where?
[08:41:37] <devi8> hover over agir
[08:42:03] <lissitzki> but i have no link sorry
[08:42:23] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/q1dcbwnf/22/
[08:42:55] <devi8> I'm used to using codepen where the link doesn't change.. sorry. I added some suggestions below
[08:44:07] <lissitzki> i see thank you
[08:44:24] <lissitzki> yeah i know, it is a multi level menu
[08:44:52] <AdamPDotty> I got a two level ddm on my page, but I guess nobody uses it.
[08:45:50] <devi8> ddm?
[08:46:36] <devi8> the problem with dropdown menus often is that the hover state is hard to duplicate on touch-driven devices
[08:49:24] <AdamPDotty> and then annoying little gaps where hovering stops
[08:49:44] <devi8> that's why I love flexbox.
[09:00:14] <lissitzki> i see
[09:00:51] <lissitzki> in fact for the mobile device is quite not possible
[09:01:09] <lissitzki> my client wants something like thi: http://www.irb-paris.eu/
[09:01:31] <lissitzki> and i'm having an hard time doing that
[09:01:44] <lissitzki> also because on mobile is not possible
[09:02:05] <lissitzki> i should propose something different
[09:02:27] <devi8> it's terrible
[09:03:36] <lissitzki> the fact is that he needs like 3-levels navaigation
[09:04:09] <lissitzki> the idea should be more like a folder structure than a dropdown menu
[09:04:28] <devi8> and it looks like all they are doing is animating sequentially each sub element inline
[09:05:48] <lissitzki> yup
[09:05:49] <devi8> explain to them that it is bad user experience to click on a menu item and then not be sure where it goes becuase the entire menu reformatted itself
[09:06:13] <devi8> and explain that color is the only hierarchy identifier which is terrible. It takes a while to figure that out
[09:06:22] <lissitzki> yeah i 've some freedom, but still not an idea about it
[09:06:57] <devi8> what is it for? what's the product?
[09:07:05] <lissitzki> photo portfolio
[09:07:19] <lissitzki> organized in categories and subcategories
[09:07:29] <lissitzki> and even sub-sub-categories
[09:07:53] <devi8> an artists portfolio? or a technical portfolio?
[09:08:24] <thykka> people don't think in trees.. sub-sub-categories only serve to obfuscate
[09:09:05] <lissitzki> artist
[09:09:38] <lissitzki> ok, i'll push him to force it in just subcat
[09:09:45] <lissitzki> but still
[09:09:47] <devi8> he should consider less structure more tags
[09:09:57] <lissitzki> that's a good point
[09:10:02] <devi8> so things can go in multiple categories
[09:10:18] <devi8> then you explore your interests rather than his rigid hierarchy
[09:12:02] <devi8> plus, for a portfolio, you want the content to be the focus. The nav should be an aid to seeing more content or navigating through lots of content. it shouldn't be the content
[09:14:25] <lissitzki> well i see things are getting complicated, how would you do it?
[09:14:42] <lissitzki> i'll keep the line format
[09:14:47] <devi8> depends on the contet
[09:14:57] <devi8> what kind of art does he/she do?
[09:15:02] <lissitzki> photos
[09:15:06] <lissitzki> and some videos
[09:15:16] <devi8> like color photos or dead cat photos?
[09:15:26] <lissitzki> ahha, color
[09:15:36] <devi8> what is the theme?
[09:22:18] <lissitzki> very simple
[09:22:45] <lissitzki> white with different layout based on the photo project
[09:23:02] <lissitzki> from one column, to rows of 6 photos
[09:23:07] <lissitzki> like  a contact sheet
[09:25:37] <lissitzki> ok, let's say i keep a structure with one subfolder
[09:26:21] <devi8> I would likely keep the list of tags (categories, whatever) as text like he requested, but show as many as possible -smaller-across the top but display the subcategories below the top rows and responsive to what you hover over with intent (or click) but not so the menu jerks out from underneath you..just quietyly display the sub tags in a panel below
[09:26:24] <lissitzki> that's already a way clearer.
[09:27:34] <lissitzki> i see
[09:27:43] <lissitzki> not that hassle with the aniamtion
[09:28:27] <devi8> and make the non-selected menuitems off-white on a white background once one is selected. it allows you to focus on the next level of menu/tags
[09:28:50] <lissitzki> cool
[09:28:59] <lissitzki> how to go back then?
[09:29:09] <lissitzki> a home link isn't useful?
[09:29:13] <devi8> if nothing is selected, they can be darker, but selecting one, makes them all but disappear...then the submenu is a colored
[09:30:08] <devi8> clicking on another item on any level would hide that level..
[09:31:40] <lissitzki> yes
[09:31:50] <lissitzki> and you do that with css, or js?
[09:35:24] <lissitzki> using flexbx as suggested
[09:37:01] <devi8> some js, but mostly css. something like this: https://imgur.com/4YEIcwt
[09:39:59] <rjCousineau> Hello.  I have two seperate elements, that when I click, it will show the 2nd element.  When I click the 2nd element, I was hoping to use $(e.relatedTarget) to know which element triggers the 2nd element to show.  I'm not too sure how relatedTarget works.  I know in bootstrap the modal uses relatedTarget for knowing what invoked it. I'm not sure how to define relatedTarget or if that's how you
[09:39:59] <rjCousineau> use it.  Maybe theres an easier option.
[09:44:43] <devi8> rjCousineau, handle the click event on a shared ancestor of both elements. Then it always knows which of the two was clicked for what reason.
[09:47:26] <rjCousineau> ty
[10:41:46] <alialmoullim> Hello guys
[10:41:59] <alialmoullim> can i get help sorting div's based on their id number
[10:42:00] <alialmoullim> https://hastebin.com/ocivetuxof.xml
[10:42:27] <taplar> what have you tried?
[10:43:02] <alialmoullim> every answer to this question i could find on stackoverflow
[10:43:43] <taplar> can you show me a fiddle of what you've tried?
[10:44:19] <alialmoullim> umm, give me a minute to lookup the last thing i tried
[10:44:51] <taplar> because it's a pretty simple application of selecting the elements, getting their array, and sorting the array
[10:45:02] <taplar> using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[10:46:41] <alialmoullim> https://jsfiddle.net/LtggL7ft/
[10:48:23] <taplar> your selector is incorrect
[10:48:32] <alialmoullim> i looked the page but i couldn't figure out how to apply that into my code
[10:48:37] <taplar> you're missing the # on the id
[10:48:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/LtggL7ft/1/
[10:49:52] <alialmoullim> i see
[10:49:59] <alialmoullim> but its still not sorting them?
[10:50:06] <taplar> look at the console
[10:50:16] <taplar> sorting the array doesn't update the dom
[10:50:34] <taplar> you have to replace the elements with their sorted version
[10:52:10] <alialmoullim> im just seeing 1 2 3 in the console
[10:52:23] <taplar> cause that's what your code is logging
[10:53:09] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/LtggL7ft/3/
[10:53:16] <alialmoullim> ok, how do i go about changing the the DOM using that code?
[10:53:18] <taplar> you just have to take the results and update the dom
[10:53:40] <taplar> you can set the html() of the parent with the resulting sorted array
[10:55:53] <alialmoullim> I'm sorry but I still don't understand how will I do that :/
[10:56:44] <taplar> var $parent = $(parentSelector); var $thing = $parent.find(divSelector).sort(...);  $parent.html($thing);
[11:00:30] <alialmoullim> I managed to do it here: https://jsfiddle.net/LtggL7ft/3/
[11:00:39] <alialmoullim> but it brakes the css part
[11:01:18] <taplar> that's the same link i gave before
[11:01:59] <taplar> also if you look in the html section, if you see any tags highlighted in red, that is jsfiddle telling you have invalid markup
[11:03:52] <alialmoullim> Oh, i can't figure out how to fix it, don't understand what the mistake is really.
[11:04:02] <alialmoullim> https://i.imgur.com/tRdm2p0.png this is how it breaks it
[11:04:22] <taplar> i can't really debug a picture man
[11:05:06] <alialmoullim> if you are willing to wait, i will copy the related css into jsfiddle
[11:07:13] <taplar> i actually need to step away to handle some stuff in the office.  i'll be afk for a bit.
[11:31:10] <lissitzki> hi
[11:31:12] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/24/
[11:31:50] <lissitzki> the code seems ok to me, but the menu is not hiding when click is on
[11:32:41] <lissitzki> ok i solved it :)
[11:33:36] <rapidecho> Hiya. I want the slide animation to start from the top of the div and "roll down". Right now, the slide kinda expands from the middle of the div above it, which looks terrible
[11:33:42] <rapidecho> is there some option I'm missing to do this?
[11:45:04] <alialmoullim> Guys, silly question
[11:45:25] <alialmoullim> https://hastebin.com/evifiyipoy.js
[11:45:39] <alialmoullim> How can i do this without being repetitive?
[11:48:27] <Woet> a loop?
[11:55:28] <alialmoullim> i don't know really. is it possible to achieve that in a loop
[11:56:06] <alialmoullim> check here for better understanding of what im doing: https://jsfiddle.net/jmwj7n57/
[11:56:34] <alialmoullim> how will loop though them?
[11:57:01] <alialmoullim> i don't really know much of JS or jQuery
[12:50:49] <taplar> are all the in methods the same and all the out methods the same?
[12:58:56] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jmwj7n57/6/
[12:59:24] <taplar> this could all be done with just css though, since all the elements are nested in the element that is hovered
[13:00:26] <devi8> and the right column hover animation looks off (even though it probably isn't)
[13:15:03] <Muks_> Hi I have multiple dynamic dropdown named #A1 on click of that I want to populate drop down #B1 same way on click of #A2 dropdown #B2 will be populated.
[13:15:04] <alialmoullim> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/jmwj7n57/5/
[13:15:17] <alialmoullim> animation need some editing but its what i was looking for
[13:15:31] <Muks_> is it possible to do it using single function?
[13:15:32] <Gh0st_Preacher> Muks_ when you say "named #A1", what do you mean?
[13:15:38] <Gh0st_Preacher> can you show us?
[13:15:44] <taplar> all that can be done with just css alialmoullim
[13:16:09] <taplar> alialmoullim: css has the :hover option that is applied only on hover
[13:16:25] <Muks_> Gh0st_Preacher I mean <select id="A1">
[13:16:33] <taplar> so  div { ...normal format... }  div:hover { ...hover format... }
[13:16:38] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ you can't repeat the same ID.
[13:16:42] <robertmaxrees> IDs are unique per page.
[13:17:15] <Muks_> robertmaxrees I am not repeating, next dropdown will be A2 and so on
[13:17:18] <alialmoullim> taplar i was using javascript for the animation
[13:17:28] <alialmoullim> though it can be done with css transition
[13:17:30] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ so "Hi I have multiple dynamic
[13:17:31] <robertmaxrees> dropdown named #A1
[13:17:43] <robertmaxrees> that's where I'm lost :)
[13:17:44] <taplar> and i'm saying it could be done with just css, without swapping classes
[13:17:55] <robertmaxrees> either way, yeah, you could do that with a single handler.
[13:18:02] <Muks_> robertmaxrees sorry for confusion :D
[13:18:11] <robertmaxrees> though dunno why it's so important that you use one function.
[13:18:34] <alialmoullim> taplar: too lazy to work it out atm, i'll just focous on the functionality of what im creating and worry about that later
[13:18:40] <alialmoullim> thx though for noting that out to me
[13:18:40] <Muks_> I need to write 10 function with just id change
[13:18:47] <Muks_> feeling it is not good programming
[13:18:57] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ and all those 10 functions are the same?
[13:18:57] <taplar> Muks_: data elements would be useful here i think
[13:19:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:19:03] <robertmaxrees> and a class.
[13:19:09] <taplar> data-target="otherthingtochange"
[13:19:47] <Muks_> robertmaxrees Yeaa almost as Id "A{i}" will populate Id "B{i}"
[13:20:00] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ yeah, check out taplar's suggestion.
[13:20:03] <taplar> <select id="a1" data-target="b1">
[13:20:32] <robertmaxrees> add a class="dynamic-dropdown" and you're g2g.
[13:21:36] <Muks_> taplar sorry did not get this
[13:21:51] <taplar> you can use the data-target as the distinguisher
[13:22:00] <taplar> it will tell the handler what secondary element to change
[13:22:12] <taplar> as per roberts class suggestion
[13:22:22] <taplar> <select id="a1" class="dynamic-dropdown" data-target="b1">
[13:22:49] <taplar> $('.dynamic-dropdown').on('change', function(){ var $otherthing = $('#'+ $(this).data('target')); });
[13:23:33] <Muks_> :O
[13:23:42] <Muks_> I have written something like
[13:23:43] <taplar> data elements are a useful way to provide extra information about and element within the dom itself
[13:23:53] <Muks_> $(document).on("change", '#A', function(e) {
[13:32:50] <robertmaxrees> #A is for id="A"
[13:33:20] <Muks_> Yess
[13:33:32] <robertmaxrees> you want to target classes.
[13:33:52] <Muks_> it was working when I had only one source and target drop down
[13:33:58] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:33:59] <Muks_> now i have around 10-20
[13:34:07] <robertmaxrees> because you can only target one element with a given ID.
[13:34:17] <Muks_> Sorry I am not very good in Jquery.. :-(
[13:34:19] <robertmaxrees> you want to use classes so you can target all of those elements.
[13:34:43] <taplar> this is a javascript concept.  as robert said earlier, ids are unique identifiers per page
[13:34:52] <Muks_> Okay
[13:34:55] <taplar> you can think of them like drivers licenses
[13:35:19] <taplar> it's purpose is to identify you, and only you
[13:35:43] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[13:35:52] <robertmaxrees> classes are like describing somebody using their hair color.
[13:35:59] <robertmaxrees> multiple people can have brown hair.
[13:36:12] <Muks_> so if I used class="X", then how will I know that I clicked on dropdown A1 and then I need to populate B1?
[13:36:28] <Muks_> thanks Great example :-)
[13:36:34] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ inside your event handler, $(this) is the element you clicked.
[13:36:47] <robertmaxrees> then you can access the data attribute taplar mentioned.
[13:36:59] <robertmaxrees> $(this).data('target') or w/e
[13:37:39] <Muks_> Okay seems my stoneBrain is catching some signals.. :D
[13:38:38] <Muks_> Got It now.. let me try.. Thanks a ton! robertmaxrees and taplar
[13:41:17] * taplar sings wonderboy
[13:41:26] <taplar> high above the muky muck
[13:43:11] <Muks_> :D
[13:50:30] <Muks_> I had this line before "//var $el = $("#competitorAds");"
[13:50:45] <Muks_> changed it to "var $el =$(this).data('target');"
[13:50:57] <Muks_> now getting error at " $el.empty();"
[13:51:36] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[13:51:36] <Muks_> custom.js:156 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'empty' of undefined
[13:51:38] <robertmaxrees> also.
[13:51:42] <robertmaxrees> oh wait.
[13:51:52] <robertmaxrees> what is $(this).data('target')?
[13:51:54] <robertmaxrees> a selector?
[13:52:04] <Muks_> Yeaa
[13:52:11] <robertmaxrees> gotta pass it to $()
[13:52:31] <Muks_> a <select >
[13:52:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:52:43] <robertmaxrees> i mean it's a string to select elem,ents.
[13:52:45] <Muks_> though if I put alert it is giving correct name
[13:52:52] <robertmaxrees> right - it's just a string.
[13:52:56] <robertmaxrees> not the actual element.
[13:53:01] <Muks_> :O
[13:53:04] <robertmaxrees> var targetSelector = $(this).data('target'), $targetElement = $(targetSelector);
[13:54:32] <Muks_> can you plz rewrite this line?
[13:54:33] <Muks_> var $el =$(this).data('target');
[13:54:38] <robertmaxrees> ....
[13:54:42] <robertmaxrees> i just showed you what you need to do.
[13:54:55] <robertmaxrees> like, literally what you need.
[14:20:48] <Muks_> I am not getting any error even Ajax is returning all the element in console.log() but still target select is not getting populated
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[14:21:15] <robertmaxrees> show us your code.
[14:26:03] <grapheti> http://slopeofhope.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/0915-coder.png
[14:27:45] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:32:47] <Muks_> https://jsfiddle.net/0xo4y1r2/1/
[14:33:10] <Muks_> robertmaxrees  taplar_afk
[14:33:26] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ okay, so what in here isn't working?
[14:35:06] <robertmaxrees> also: a couple notes - you need a delegated handler for all the other dropdowns to work.
[14:35:40] <Muks_>           robertmaxrees          $el.empty(); after this things are not working
[14:36:09] <robertmaxrees> and right now you've got data-target="competitorAds1".  so when you do $(this).data('target'), what you get back is 'competitorAds1'
[14:36:23] <robertmaxrees> so then you're trying to run $('competitorAds1') - see the issue?
[14:37:01] <Muks_> my target selector is not getting populated even though PHP is returning values
[14:37:05] <robertmaxrees> ....
[14:37:24] <robertmaxrees> your target selector isn't finding anything because $('competitorAds1') doesn't match anythinbg.
[14:38:03] <robertmaxrees> you need to make that an ID selector.
[14:39:11] <Guest81> Hey guys, I tried to make a slide where you have images change by sliding from the side and I did it by using layers but it doesn't work well. Can anyone take a look at the code and tell me what's wrong? https://pastebin.com/nu0V5fH4
[14:39:32] <Muks_> "you need to make that an ID selector."??
[14:40:12] <devi8> I am having difficulty using requestAnimationFrame to throttle scroll event can someone explain how to use it?
[14:40:13] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ do you know how to select things by ID?
[14:40:26] <robertmaxrees> devi8 i'd hit up ##javascript for that one :)
[14:40:32] <Muks_> $("#id")
[14:40:36] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ right
[14:40:37] <devi8> willdo
[14:40:42] <devi8> thx
[14:40:49] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ so what's the issue with your current sele3ctor?
[14:42:07] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ if the selector needs a # to select by ID, but you're passing in 'competitorAds1', what's the issuer?
[14:42:10] <robertmaxrees> *issue
[14:42:10] <Muks_> # is missing I think
[14:42:15] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:42:19] <robertmaxrees> so make sure that gets added.
[14:42:48] <Muks_> can I add it with dynamic value what returned?
[14:42:59] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[14:43:03] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other string.
[14:46:29] <Muks_> var $el =$("#"+$(this).data('target')); I tried this
[14:46:55] <robertmaxrees> Guest81 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dbsmdeb8/
[14:46:59] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ that looks about right.
[14:47:10] <robertmaxrees> Guest81 is this what's happening now?
[15:19:11] <Muks_> Even if selecting Id Its not working :(
[15:19:49] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ show me what you have now.
[15:20:59] <Inazad> Hi there, there is a simple/quick way to avoid using pagination ?
[15:21:13] <robertmaxrees> Inazad depends :)
[15:21:26] <robertmaxrees> sometimes pagination is a good thing.
[15:27:55] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:31:14] <Inazad> robertmaxrees, example if I got 1,000 rows
[15:31:35] <Inazad> does infinite scroll will be faster ?
[15:31:44] <Inazad> or the page will load a huge amount of data then hide the content
[15:32:01] <robertmaxrees> that depends on how you implement the pagination.
[15:32:13] <Muks_> https://jsfiddle.net/0xo4y1r2/3/
[15:32:21] <robertmaxrees> but it sounds like you have some kind of tabular structure, yeah Inazad?
[15:32:41] <Muks_> robertmaxrees If I hardcode the value then it is getting the result
[15:32:56] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ so when *doesn't* it work?
[15:33:00] <Muks_> so somewhere I am not finding the exact object where it has to populate..
[15:33:14] <robertmaxrees> and show me what you actually tried.
[15:33:18] <robertmaxrees> not a hack to get around it :)
[15:33:38] <Inazad> robertmaxrees, I display 2 "cards" by row, if I got 1,000 rows
[15:33:40] <Muks_> All the commented code I tried down hardcoded value
[15:33:42] <Inazad> which is fastest ?
[15:34:04] <Muks_> like I added "#" in the HTML ID itself
[15:34:08] <Muks_> but still no luck
[15:34:26] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ right, so show me one of those cases - update the fiddle to show me a broken one.
[15:34:31] <robertmaxrees> also sample data would be suuuper helpful.
[15:34:37] <salad> why is this working https://codepen.io/bahersaad/pen/LLooPg?page=7& and this is not? https://jsfiddle.net/5datdksk/
[15:34:47] <robertmaxrees> Inazad that depends on your defionition of "fastest" :)
[15:34:53] <salad> it`s the same thing
[15:35:11] <robertmaxrees> salad you'ree missing jquery in the jsfiddle version.
[15:35:38] <salad> i have used ctrl a ctrl c
[15:35:52] <robertmaxrees> salad right, you still don't have jquery loaded on the jsfiddl;e.
[15:35:53] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/ILkljay.png
[15:35:59] <robertmaxrees> gotta manually add it and then it'll work.
[15:36:14] <salad> ah, thanks
[15:38:35] <salad> what is that integrity value in the first link hre
[15:38:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:39:10] <robertmaxrees> you mean for the css file?
[15:39:35] <salad> ah nvm i googled
[15:39:47] <salad> intrgrity and crossorigin
[15:39:55] <salad> in href
[15:40:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  quick way to make sure the file really is what it says it is.
[15:40:46] <Muks_> robertmaxrees I copied same piece of code and created 5 copies of that for each dropDown separately, it is working, But I am hating this code.. :| Crashing now.. Thanks, Bye!
[15:40:59] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[15:41:02] <robertmaxrees> Muks_ lol
[15:41:13] <robertmaxrees> this really isn't that hard but alright.
[15:41:41] <Muks_> robertmaxrees yeaa somewhere missing in target part will try again tomorrow
[15:41:53] <robertmaxrees> i was able to get it to work just fine.
[15:41:54] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[15:41:58] * robertmaxrees shrugs
[17:29:47] * taplar snoopy dances
[17:30:03] <robertmaxrees> noice
[17:30:17] <taplar> finally getting the qas to switch to selenium
[17:31:24] <robertmaxrees> ooooooooh
[17:31:35] <robertmaxrees> very, very nice.  our folks have been with that for a while.
[17:31:35] <taplar> which a part of doing so is a gradual rewrite of the tests, which means a chance to clean up that spagetti code base.
[17:32:05] <taplar> oh i've been ready for it.
[17:32:13] <taplar> just the existance of the By class, game changer
[17:32:23] <taplar> no more "this element doesn't have an id".
[17:32:28] <taplar> use a class lookup fool!
[17:32:40] <robertmaxrees> oh, get ready for a whole new level of rage.
[17:32:45] <taplar> ?
[17:33:33] <robertmaxrees> our guys refused to learn basic selectors and then decided that the right solution was to start putting qa- prefixed classnames on stuff.
[17:33:46] <taplar> :o
[17:33:53] <taplar> wtf
[17:34:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[17:34:13] <robertmaxrees> so i tipped off our frontend plat guys to go fight that fight.
[17:34:58] <taplar> i'm fully anticipating having the discussion of "we need an id"  "you don't need an id anymore, you can use whatever"  "but everything already has ids.  we need to be consistent"
[17:35:13] <taplar> "its how we've always done it"
[17:35:26] <taplar> but that's anger for future taplar
[17:36:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:36:51] <robertmaxrees> i wish you the best of luck.
[17:37:03] <robertmaxrees> but it will be a lot better in the long run.
[17:37:49] <taplar> it's been interesting watching it reach the breaking point.  a few months back we had the issue with the browsers stopping support for tls 1
[17:38:01] <taplar> and the certs with our current product are tls 1 signed
[17:38:15] <taplar> so for a while we were stuck running tests on an older browser version
[17:38:25] <taplar> and then they finally figured out how to get a new cert
[17:38:48] <taplar> cause the company wasn't much help.  it was like "switch to our new product, which you have to pay for, and it'll work"
[17:39:10] <taplar> but just this week they ran into something CORS related that it didn't like and it was the same answer
[17:39:19] <taplar> and to my surprise they were like, so we need to do selenium
[17:39:34] <taplar> really?  the thing i spiked months ago and have in a repo ready and waiting?
[17:39:37] <taplar> :D
[17:39:59] <taplar> vendication!
[17:40:23] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:40:32] <robertmaxrees> pat yourself on the back for that one.
[17:40:36] <robertmaxrees> you earned it ;)
[17:40:57] <taplar> yep pretty happy about it, at this point.  working with one of the qas to get it up and running on their box and in general.
[17:41:21] <taplar> then it's just a matter of trying to get them into an OO frame of mind
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> once they get the basic breakdown it should be pretty easy.
[17:42:12] <grapheti> Isn't FP all the rage?
[17:42:23] <taplar> FP?
[17:42:23] <robertmaxrees> sure, unless you're in Java.
[17:42:28] <robertmaxrees> functional programming
[17:42:30] <taplar> ah
[17:43:10] <taplar> OO makes sense in our app as you are dealing with object concepts.  pages can be thought of as objects.  a browser is an object.  etc.
[17:43:16] <grapheti> dependency injection, blah
[17:43:26] <taplar> DI is awesome
[17:43:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:43:43] <robertmaxrees> i view pretty much every website as a data transform.
[17:44:09] <robertmaxrees> your backend can do whatever, but your frontend that's actually serving stuff should be pretty simple.
[17:45:01] <grapheti> ye
[17:45:10] <grapheti> I've been liking vue lately
[17:45:24] <taplar> i need to get back into vue
[17:45:29] <taplar> r/need/want
[17:46:02] <taplar> which reminds me i wanted to checkout my github thing.  if i'm not wrong someone forked one of my projects
[17:46:15] <robertmaxrees> niiiice
[17:46:41] <grapheti> Congratz! You just got forked.
[17:46:55] <taplar> if so, i'm just curious as to how they are changing it
[17:47:11] <otahak> hi guys. Im trying to create an API dumpy tool thing for internal use that'll dump a CSV of pre-made queries. The first one (adroll) works fine as intended. The second one - shareasale - doesnt.. can anyone help me figure out why? https://jsfiddle.net/e1bo748y/
[17:48:51] <robertmaxrees> otahak define "doesn't work"
[17:49:32] <otahak> well, no errors, but opens a new window and *doesnt* initiate a download, as opposed to the first one which opens a new window, closes it, and initiates a download.
[17:50:33] <robertmaxrees> are you getting into that conditional in the first place?
[17:50:57] <otahak> let me do a quick console.log to check. 1 sec.
[17:52:28] <otahak> yes. its getting there.
[17:52:40] <otahak> and Ive been dumping the reply from the API - its definitely there.
[17:52:54] <otahak> "{success: "Success: API session successfully started!", token: "LBWP18JwYrdfJwvuHil6g4X0d9yVXKPt", reply: Array(3346)}"
[17:52:57] <robertmaxrees> there are only two differences between the two.
[17:53:08] <robertmaxrees> var csv = 'SKU, Name, URL, Price, Image, Desc, Status\n'; and csv += '"' + reply[i]['sku'] + '",' + '"' + reply[i]['name'] + '","https://xxx.com/image/' + reply[i]['keyword'] + '","' + reply[i]['price'] + '","https://xxx.com/' + reply[i]['image'] + '","https://xxx.com/' + reply[i]['image'] + '","' + reply[i]['description'] + '","1"\n';
[17:53:26] <robertmaxrees> so i have no idea.  without having a full example, it's hard to say.
[17:56:44] <otahak> drats. yeah, I even tried just dumping one var at a time - no diece.
[17:56:51] <otahak> dice*
[17:58:15] <otahak> scratch that. things are suddenly working now?
[17:58:23] <otahak> anyway, thanks all the same robertmaxrees
[18:00:24] <otahak> oh! it was the HTML! 'description' contains unescaped html
[18:00:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:47:47] <taplar> hasta leugo
