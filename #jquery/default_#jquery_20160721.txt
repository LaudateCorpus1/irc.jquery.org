[02:25:38] <Saint_Isidore> I have a retargeting pixel I want to add to a website, but I want to place it within a setTimeout() function. Would I need to keep the script tags in if its inside a js function?
[05:21:35] <crockstylie> Hello, I made a web app with php scripts called with jquery ajax function. Is it a known issue when sometimes ajax calls are made many times instead of one ? (when press f12 I can see in my network that every script is called 4 times. Sometines its one time as requested, sometimes more)
[05:33:46] <Markthemark> does anyone have an idea why this jquery plugin doesn’t work here? http://mtode.com
[05:34:00] <Markthemark> the plugin i installed is this : http://lab.hakim.se/ladda/
[05:36:00] <iaj_> Hi there, when I want to "move" upwards from a certain child element, to find a parent with class "foo"... which function do I need to take a look at?
[05:36:18] <iaj_> I'm currently using .parent().parent().parent(), but is there a better way?
[05:41:30] <tom_____> iaj_, .closest('.foo')
[05:42:04] <iaj_> ah perfect, thanks tom_____
[05:42:15] <tom_____> :-)
[05:42:41] <theeboat> hi, i am using the data-toggle and data-target options within html to load a bootstrap modal. I then want to be able to get the data fields in which are associated with this cell in the table but they're showing as undefined. Can able see what im doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/Nt3B17Dm
[05:45:46] <tom_____> theeboat, you're not selecting that a with the selector
[05:46:19] <tom_____> the <a> does not have the stopModal id
[06:03:17] <theeboat> tom_____: i thought the data-target worked in a similar way. when the link is clicked it does show the modal but does not get the variables needed
[07:55:31] <maxpen_> guys can someone help me with solving this whitespace?
[07:55:32] <maxpen_> https://gyazo.com/b20b4366fc94763a53bf9e3ad03de671

[10:19:23] <nanogram> hello world
[10:43:20] <taplar> yo
[11:50:00] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[11:50:10] <taplar> indeed
[12:17:21] <Simbaclaws> does anyone know how to use multiple actions in a single if line, so for example: showSomething === true ? dosomething() : doSomething2() doSomething3();?
[12:17:24] <Captain_Ramius> Hey, anyone familiar with Google Apps Script (and willing to admit it in public)?
[12:17:56] <Captain_Ramius> *or at least with Google "ServiceLogin"
[12:17:57] <robertmaxrees> Simbaclaws you mean in a ternary?
[12:18:09] <Simbaclaws> not sure what it was called but I think so...
[12:18:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:18:49] <taplar> probably stick them in a {}, but i would argue against a ternary in that case
[12:18:54] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[12:18:58] <Simbaclaws> that
[12:19:02] <Simbaclaws> is what I thought aswell
[12:19:04] <robertmaxrees> use an if.
[12:19:24] <Simbaclaws> someone who wrote the code put it in a ternary, I'm just thinking about adding a extra line so I suppose I'll just convert it to an if
[12:19:41] <taplar> ternary are quick simple dirty
[12:19:48] <taplar> if it's not that, don't do it, :D
[12:20:03] <Simbaclaws> but it is quick simple and dirty ^.^
[12:20:15] <taplar> let me tack on readable
[12:20:25] <taplar> :P
[12:20:26] <Simbaclaws> yeah that it is definitly not
[12:20:28] <robertmaxrees> also: people generally use ternaries for assignments.
[12:20:59] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator has examples for more complex usages though.
[12:21:03] <robertmaxrees> but in this case, just go with the if.
[12:23:28] <Simbaclaws> oh this just looks stupid, he put 3 ternary's underneath eachother all with the same condition -,-
[12:23:40] <Simbaclaws> I'd just put them all in one if
[12:23:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:23:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:25:33] <Simbaclaws> oh I realised there is a if underneath the 3 ternary's with the same condition aswell... Who coded this 0.o???
[12:25:47] <robertmaxrees> more than 5 people ;)
[12:25:54] <Simbaclaws> probably
[12:27:04] <taplar> paranoid people, who wanted to make sure the conditional hadn't changed, :D
[12:27:22] <taplar> skerd of the ghosts in the machine
[12:35:37] <PCatinean> Hey guys, can someone tell me how the hell is this 3d model on this website done? https://sketchfab.com/
[12:36:03] <robertmaxrees> canvas
[12:36:33] <robertmaxrees> and webgl
[12:38:40] <PCatinean> I guess there are few browsers that support that right?
[12:39:04] <robertmaxrees> all modern ones should support it.
[12:40:51] <robertmaxrees> Desktop browsers: Internet Explorer 11+, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, Mobile browsers: Safari iOS, Android Chrome, Mobile IE
[12:40:59] <robertmaxrees> 360° panorama fallback for browsers that don't support WebGL.
[12:41:14] <robertmaxrees> specs are listed on their site :)
[12:41:26] <PCatinean> wow ie from version 11, that's good
[12:41:38] <robertmaxrees> lol that's technically the last version of IE.
[12:41:40] <PCatinean> http://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl
[12:41:44] <robertmaxrees> edge should be supported, too.
[12:41:51] <robertmaxrees> and they're using canvas for most of that it looks like.
[12:42:12] <robertmaxrees> IE11 is actually not as bad of a browser as people think.
[12:42:17] <PCatinean> I have a dream where one could configure a product online, have it change color, shape etc and be able to rotate it as such
[12:42:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:42:29] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[12:42:31] <PCatinean> Not sure how difficult thatwould be, mostly for simple models?
[12:42:35] <PCatinean> not easy huh? :))))
[12:42:42] <robertmaxrees> we'd love something like that here, but you're going to run into a MAJOR problem.
[12:42:58] <PCatinean> reasources are preloaded at start?
[12:43:01] <robertmaxrees> sourcing 3d models for all of that.
[12:43:23] <PCatinean> not sure how that works nor what it implies
[12:43:32] <robertmaxrees> you want to configure products, right?
[12:43:32] <PCatinean> how is a 3d model generated and ported to webgl?
[12:43:35] <PCatinean> yes sir
[12:43:59] <robertmaxrees> so you'd need to be able to generate 3d models of all those products, accessories, attachments, etc.
[12:44:14] <PCatinean> and that's...difficult? time consuming?
[12:44:14] <robertmaxrees> with information about where they go on the product.
[12:44:19] <PCatinean> true, yes
[12:44:20] <robertmaxrees> very time consuming.
[12:44:28] <robertmaxrees> what kinds of products do you sell?
[12:44:51] <PCatinean> I'm a developer, depends on the customer, ranges from flagpoles with only a few parts, to beds, and maybe more complex stuff
[12:45:15] <PCatinean> 360 view is not mandatory at least not at this point, more like click and animate
[12:45:16] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, you're not going to commonly find ready-made 3d models of most products.
[12:45:25] <robertmaxrees> product images in general are like that.
[12:45:28] <PCatinean> how does one generate it?
[12:45:36] <robertmaxrees> using 3d modeling software.
[12:45:45] <PCatinean> and you somehow import it in webgl
[12:46:04] <robertmaxrees> errr, you use something like sketchfab.
[12:46:07] <PCatinean> The thing is, anything over standard 2d images that overlap would be better
[12:46:14] <robertmaxrees> i know.
[12:46:26] <PCatinean> this might be a few steps ahead but
[12:47:09] <robertmaxrees> let's put it this way: my company did over half a billion in sales last year.  we have struggles working with systems like that because getting the assets alone is like pulling teeth
[12:47:38] <robertmaxrees> and we throw money at problems.  not saying it can't be done, but it's a much bigger struggle than you'd think.
[12:48:25] <PCatinean> I'll take your word for it
[12:48:40] <PCatinean> Not nearly as much experienced in the technical part nor working environment
[12:49:18] <robertmaxrees> I'd LOVE to see somebody pull something like that off - product configuration is a massive pain in the ass.  so much so that most ecom sites opt to not really do it.  hell, i'm in the middle of working on sprucing it up right now for our sites and it's still a pain.
[12:50:10] <PCatinean> I'm working mostly on the configuration rules and such
[12:50:28] <PCatinean> http://threejs.org/docs/index.html#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene
[12:50:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that stuff is a pain.  highly configurable products are a shit experience.
[12:50:50] <PCatinean> indeed they are, I've refactored the code twice, and I still need more flexibility
[12:51:06] <PCatinean> think building a PC from the ground up, with resitrctions regarding motherboard, processor, ram etc
[12:51:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:51:14] <robertmaxrees> well aware :)
[12:51:23] <robertmaxrees> we sell shower systems.  very, VERY similar.
[12:51:35] <robertmaxrees> plus lots of other stuff.  handlesets.
[12:52:26] <PCatinean> we can make the world a better place robertmaxrees XD
[12:53:02] <PCatinean> so I guess the only thing I should focus on is just have the multiple images overlay on eachother
[12:53:11] <PCatinean> (atm it's one configuration code eq. one particular image)
[12:53:12] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't even go that far imo.  but sure.
[12:53:38] <PCatinean> so if you chage just the rims of a car, a whole new image has to come up
[12:53:39] <PCatinean> that kinda sucks
[12:53:50] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't even go THAT far heh.
[12:53:54] <robertmaxrees> but that's just me.
[12:54:16] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could do something like that, but it really depends on how visual the product is i guess.
[12:54:27] <dp_> With jQuery UI tabs, how can I create a clickable link in the content of one of the tabs, that will let me switch to another tab?
[12:54:48] <robertmaxrees> dp_ by using an event listener :)
[12:58:01] <VectorX> how apply [class$='month-filter'] to $('.news-month-filter.selected-month, .post-month-filter.selected-month')    effect of [class$='month-filter'].selected-month
[12:58:22] <robertmaxrees> VectorX any reason you can't use .filter() instead? :)
[12:58:45] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, minimum for starters
[12:58:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:59:00] <VectorX> $("[class$='month-filter']").filter('.selected-month) ?
[12:59:01] <PCatinean> like, the first possible level after just flat 2d images laying over each other
[12:59:02] <taplar> i mean, you kinda have it at the end of that sentence
[12:59:03] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:59:17] <robertmaxrees> VectorX and you already have the selector itself there.
[12:59:21] <VectorX> my entire line is, var filter_year = $('.news-month-filter.selected-month, .post-month-filter.selected-month').data('year') || 0;
[12:59:36] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need some clearer classes then.
[12:59:49] <taplar> personally i'd give each one a 'class-filter' class in addition to their others
[12:59:58] <taplar> err, 'month-filter'
[13:00:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:00:07] <VectorX> ok ill do that
[13:00:14] <taplar> so class="month-filter news-month-filter"
[13:00:16] <taplar> etc.
[13:00:18] <robertmaxrees> attribute selectors and their ilk should be avoided.
[13:03:15] <dp_> robertmaxrees: darn. So I can't just href="#tabs-3" :(
[13:05:00] <robertmaxrees> http://i.memecaptain.com/gend_images/z4oaXQ.jpg
[13:05:21] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/ ;)
[13:05:53] <taplar> i wear my suuuuuunglasses as night so i.....oh.   we went in completely different directions with that meme
[13:06:03] <robertmaxrees> hahahahhaa
[13:10:29] <taplar> VectorX: i take it news-month-filter and post-month-filter will not be present at the same time?
[13:10:44] <VectorX> yeah
[13:10:52] <VectorX> i changed them to month-filter anyway
[13:11:20] <taplar> that's cool, i was just noting the data usage off of potentially multiple elements in the stack
[13:26:44] <taplar> gah, i forgot how much i luv sublime text
[13:28:48] <robertmaxrees> been in something else lately?
[13:29:05] <taplar> mostly intellij and notepad++
[13:29:08] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[13:29:22] <taplar> but editing this js file i didn't want to crack open intellij just for access to Ctrl+J
[13:29:28] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:29:45] <decx> used vs code, was pleasently surprised
[13:29:58] <taplar> what's that?
[13:30:11] <decx> visual studio code
[13:30:12] <robertmaxrees> microsoft's new editor.
[13:30:17] <robertmaxrees> i've been using it for a while.
[13:30:18] <taplar> ah
[13:30:23] <robertmaxrees> electron-based.
[14:18:05] <SpecialTechnique> I'm trying to create a hover function on certain items that don't exist on the page until the user scrolls to it. Would I insert the hover in the for(var i = 0; i...){here}; ?
[14:18:07] <SpecialTechnique> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5525071/how-to-wait-until-an-element-exists
[14:18:18] <robertmaxrees> you don't.,
[14:18:25] <robertmaxrees> you use a delegated listener instead.
[14:19:47] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTechnique ^
[14:19:58] <SpecialTechnique> thanks!
[14:20:04] <SpecialTechnique> Looking into it
[14:20:24] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('mouseenter', '.theThingYouCareAbout', function() {});
[14:22:42] <SpecialTechnique> hmmm
[14:22:46] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:23:07] <SpecialTechnique> so this will work even if the element doesn't exist on the page yet correct?
[14:23:21] <robertmaxrees> so long as the parent DOES exist on pageload, yes.
[14:23:40] <robertmaxrees> the parent can be any ancestor,
[14:23:48] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:24:00] <SpecialTechnique> ehh, it doesn't. It exist only on scroll - so it seems we're ajaxing the item when the user scrolls to the parent div
[14:24:20] <robertmaxrees> there is an ancestor that exists on pageload.
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> which is what you need.
[14:32:04] <SpecialTechnique> robertmaxrees: if I do mousenter, I would also have to make one for mouseleave or can I just do it similar to how hover(function(){enter},function(){leave})?
[14:32:12] <robertmaxrees> need to do two separate ones.
[14:32:19] <SpecialTechnique> kk
[14:32:29] <SpecialTechnique> *---------
[14:32:31] <SpecialTechnique> -
[14:32:31] <SpecialTechnique> -
[14:32:32] <SpecialTechnique> -
[14:32:33] <SpecialTechnique> -
[14:32:35] <SpecialTechnique> *-
[14:32:36] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[14:32:37] <taplar> :/
[14:32:37] <SpecialTechnique> Sorry, cat...
[14:32:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:33:03] <SpecialTechnique> decided to sit on my numpad T_T
[14:33:30] <taplar> as is his right
[14:48:39] <VectorX> is there a http version of jsfiddle.net ? trying to load a external script which is on http
[14:53:43] <SpecialTechnique> He's really enjoying to mess with me today.
[15:05:56] <CuriousMind> Hi. How do I know if Jquery is working on my machine?
[15:07:46] <snover> what does “working” mean?
[15:08:26] <CuriousMind> I'm trying to grab elements on my html using JQuery. I don't think it's working
[15:09:20] <CuriousMind> I tried to check by adding an event listener to a html element using JQuery. I clicked on the html element but no alert popped up
[15:09:31] <CuriousMind> That's odd
[15:22:27] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, still there?
[15:27:11] <CuriousMind> Hi can someone help me get Jquery working on my machine?
[15:28:06] <CuriousMind> https://code.jquery.com/jquery/   I went to this site and I'm trying to get the file on my computer but it just gives me a script file
[15:28:10] <CuriousMind> How does this work?
[15:28:50] <snowmizer> hey guys quick question. I'm generating two svg elements that are next to each other. How can I reverse the order they're drawn in?
[15:30:44] <kevireilly> CuriousMind: You can either download that script file, host it somewhere, and reference it appropriately on your page or simply reference the linked script file on your page
[15:32:16] <CuriousMind> kevireilly: Hm...Someone told me to right click the version of Jquery I want on this page then link it to my html using a script file as if it was a regular javascript file
[15:32:27] <CuriousMind> kevireilly: This page https://code.jquery.com/jquery/
[15:34:19] <kevireilly> CuriousMind: yup yup, so if you have "foo" folder with index.html and jquery.js in it, you'd reference jquery from index.html like <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script> as an example
[15:35:12] <kevireilly> or you can just use the URL of the script file so that it is pulled from a CDN
[15:40:13] <CuriousMind> kevireilly: Yes that's what I did the first time, but I am downloading the file because JQuery doesnt seem to be working for me
[15:41:48] <kevireilly> CuriousMind: what doesn't seem to be working for you?
[15:42:01] <CuriousMind> <script src="../javascript/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"></script> kevireilly and I am not sure
[15:42:30] <CuriousMind> kevireilly:  I say that because I am trying to grab html elements using JQuery and I added a event listener as a test if I interacted with the html and it didn't work
[15:42:58] <kevireilly> CuriousMind: check the console, you should see whether or not the file was loaded
[15:43:06] <taplar> CuriousMind: if you type '$' in the console what does it say?
[15:43:17] <robertmaxrees> * $.fn.jquery
[15:43:21] <CuriousMind> Hmmm good idea taplar  and yes kevireilly I think it's loaded because no red text ERROR
[15:43:46] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Is that for me and what does that mean? Should I add that to the script tag?
[15:44:01] <robertmaxrees> instead of typing $ in the console, type $.fn.jquery
[15:44:31] <robertmaxrees> chrome uses $ as a shortcute for document.querySelectorAll, so it'll work in the console just fine. $.fn.jquery will return a version for you instead of jquery is loaded.
[15:44:34] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it'll error.
[15:44:36] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: I typed in $ and I got this ->     function (a,b){return new r.fn.init(a,b)}
[15:44:39] <taplar> really?
[15:44:44] <robertmaxrees> taplar yep.
[15:44:48] <taplar> lol, that's awesome sause
[15:44:50] <robertmaxrees> try $.fn.jquery
[15:44:51] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Ah ok thank you
[15:44:56] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[15:45:04] <CuriousMind> Ok I'll put in google console $.fn.jquery, one second
[15:45:10] <AwkwardCough> huh the more you know
[15:45:16] <taplar> to hate
[15:45:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.  only a shortcut in the console though ;)
[15:45:27] <CuriousMind> "3.1.0"
[15:45:32] <robertmaxrees> awesome, so it's loading.
[15:45:34] <CuriousMind> Ok so JQuery is working then
[15:45:39] <CuriousMind> Wait huh
[15:45:46] <kevireilly> chances are that you're trying to fetch those elements before they're actually on the page and that you need to wrap your test in $(document).ready(function(){ /* get stuff from a ready dom */ });
[15:46:02] <CuriousMind> Ahhhhhh ok kevireilly
[15:46:15] <CuriousMind> Ok let's see if that works. Sorry for all these dumb questions, I'm new to Jquery
[15:46:34] <robertmaxrees> it's fine.
[15:46:55] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like to learn more about jQuery and basic javascript, check out learn.jquery.com
[15:47:15] <CuriousMind> YESSSSSS
[15:47:23] <CuriousMind> It worked!!!!! kevireilly !!!!!
[15:47:24] <CuriousMind> !!!!!
[15:47:29] <CuriousMind> Thank you everyone lol finally
[15:47:29] <taplar> :)
[15:47:34] <kevireilly> #teamwork
[15:47:45] <CuriousMind> So now I now how to add JQuery to my files and stuff lol
[15:47:48] <taplar> hold on, so your not putting the script at the bottom of the page then?
[15:48:04] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery btw ;)
[15:48:06] <CuriousMind> taplar: Nope at the top in the head before the javascript file, that is what my instructors taught me
[15:48:11] <CuriousMind> jQuery ok sorry
[15:48:18] <taplar> if you put it at the bottom you can avoid the doc ready
[15:48:26] <CuriousMind> taplar: Ohhhhh ok
[15:48:38] <CuriousMind> That is interesting, I didn't know that
[15:48:42] <CuriousMind> Here's what I learned
[15:48:55] <CuriousMind> To download a jQuery file, you do right click save link as
[15:49:09] <CuriousMind> Take that link save it to your repo on your computer then you link it in html
[15:49:13] <CuriousMind> using a script tag
[15:49:46] <CuriousMind> To avoid document ready, put jQuery script tag at bottom of file. if at top then you must put document ready in html
[15:49:54] <CuriousMind> Ok great I know now
[15:50:02] <robertmaxrees> you only need the document ready if you rely on elements that are on the page.
[15:50:10] <robertmaxrees> you can do plenty outside of the document ready.
[15:50:51] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Hmmmmmm
[15:51:09] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: You only need document ready if you rely on elements on page meaning
[15:51:22] <CuriousMind> if I want to manipulate the DOM elements on the page I use document ready
[15:51:29] <robertmaxrees> let me show you what i mean.
[15:51:35] <CuriousMind> If I'm not manipulating DOM elements, what else could I do? and ok robertmaxrees
[15:52:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kmdoa6gg/
[15:53:02] <robertmaxrees> so - notice how var someFunction = function(e) { is declared before the document ready?
[15:53:37] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Sorry I want to analyze this
[15:53:48] <CuriousMind> I'm here just trying understand the code and everything. Let me read your question
[15:53:54] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[15:55:01] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: What is e?
[15:55:05] <CuriousMind> event?
[15:55:09] <robertmaxrees> the event object, yeah
[15:55:25] <CuriousMind> e is the event object, interesting. I'll read on
[15:55:41] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees:  e.preventDefault();
[15:55:45] <CuriousMind> What does that do robertmaxrees ?
[15:56:14] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[15:56:23] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Thank you I'll read on
[15:56:31] <robertmaxrees> prevents the default action from happening.
[15:57:38] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: So whatever action an object would usually do, it prevents that action from happening?
[15:58:09] <robertmaxrees> whatever action that events would normally trigger.  so when you click on a link, normally it follows it.  in this case, it's stopping that from happening.
[15:58:14] <robertmaxrees> you're getting caught up in that detail though.
[15:58:27] <robertmaxrees> notice how the function is declared before the document ready?
[15:58:37] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: I suppose so yes
[15:59:11] <robertmaxrees> so you can (and often should) declare functions and things before the document ready and then only put stuff inside of your doc ready that actually needs the page to be, well, ready.
[16:00:19] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: hmmmmm ok
[16:00:41] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to understand this
[16:01:00] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[16:01:30] <CuriousMind> When I added document.ready, whatever was inside that method, when I clicked the DOM element it worked. But without document.ready, when I clicked the DOM element on the page, it didnt work because it wasn't "loaded"?
[16:01:45] <robertmaxrees> because it didn't yet exist in the DOM
[16:02:00] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: How long does it take to load lol? Like 2 seconds right?
[16:02:06] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[16:02:10] <robertmaxrees> sometimes milliseconds.
[16:02:14] <robertmaxrees> other times it can be minutes.
[16:02:16] <CuriousMind> I had the html file open for like a while and I clicked it and it still didnt work
[16:02:20] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Ahhh minutes
[16:02:24] <robertmaxrees> but wai.
[16:02:30] <robertmaxrees> the javascript only runs once.
[16:02:37] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: That doesnt make sense to me because I added it then it worked
[16:02:37] <robertmaxrees> the element you're selecting has to exist when the javascript runs.
[16:02:46] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: OHHHHH
[16:02:53] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't keep retrying :)
[16:02:58] <CuriousMind> Ok so wait hold on lol
[16:02:59] <robertmaxrees> also: loading and document ready are different.
[16:03:29] <CuriousMind> document.ready says when everything is loaded on the html page, execute everything that is inside this document.ready method?
[16:03:33] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:03:41] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Enlighten me please
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> document ready fires when the base page has finished rendering.
[16:03:53] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't include any other css or javascript or images.
[16:04:04] <robertmaxrees> jus tthat the base html has loaded and rendered onto the page.
[16:04:43] <robertmaxrees> that fires, then the window load event fires.  that can take some time - usually seconds.
[16:05:25] <CuriousMind> Ok let me see if I got this right robertmaxrees
[16:05:32] <CuriousMind> document.ready works when
[16:05:55] <CuriousMind> the "base html"(the html elements in my html file) "renders"
[16:06:10] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you're putting those in quotes, but yes.
[16:06:20] <CuriousMind> Not familiar with those terms robertmaxrees
[16:06:25] <robertmaxrees> (that's a simplification of it, but yeah)
[16:06:27] <CuriousMind> Im noob af to this thing
[16:06:36] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Yes I want to simply understand this LOL
[16:07:00] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: "rendering/renders" = loading?
[16:07:03] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:07:05] <robertmaxrees> again.
[16:07:06] <CuriousMind> Aw shit
[16:07:06] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:07:17] <CuriousMind> Let me search defintiion of them robertmaxrees
[16:07:31] <robertmaxrees> the window load happens AFTER - that's when all the different css, images, and js have finished loading.
[16:07:57] <robertmaxrees> the document ready is just concerned with when the browser has gotten all the html and has parsed it and loaded it into the DOM.
[16:08:20] <CuriousMind> what does parsed mean robertmaxrees ?
[16:08:48] <CuriousMind> "browser has gottem all the html and has parsed it and loaded it into the DOM."? robertmaxrees
[16:08:59] <robertmaxrees> so the browser takes the html file and reads it then translates that into the format its engine then uses to draw things onto the page.
[16:09:13] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Ahhhh ok
[16:09:40] <robertmaxrees> so it parses the html into its internal format.  then it creates an interface for the javascript called the DOM
[16:10:05] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: And that engine is some code which does that for us which is basically the whole point of a browser which is to take HTML and make things with it then put it on the screen right?
[16:10:21] <robertmaxrees> yep.  it also has engines for CSS and JS.
[16:10:44] <robertmaxrees> they do some other interesting things, too, but that's the basic gist.
[16:10:52] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Without the engines, the browser couldn't translate the css, html, and js
[16:11:09] <CuriousMind> it probably has many more engines or code for other stuff to do as well
[16:11:31] <robertmaxrees> not really.  there are some apis to run extensions, but those are usually js
[16:11:42] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Hmmmm ok
[16:11:54] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Went off on a tangent sorry, as you can see I'm ver inquisitive
[16:12:02] <CuriousMind> Trying to learn as much as I can I'm only 19 so
[16:12:11] <CuriousMind> Ok sorry so back to document ready robertmaxrees
[16:12:18] <robertmaxrees> it's all good - and your age has literally nothing to do with it :)
[16:12:28] <robertmaxrees> one of jquery's biggest contributers is like 14 or 15.
[16:12:34] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: WOW that's amazing
[16:12:35] <robertmaxrees> wicked smart kid, too.
[16:12:43] <robertmaxrees> it's technology.  age is irrelevant :)
[16:12:47] <CuriousMind> Man that makes me jealous but I can't be, he must be smart as hell
[16:14:21] <robertmaxrees> :) gotta start somewhere.
[16:14:31] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Ok so I'm going to try again and yes you are right, I have to start somewhere
[16:16:40] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: So, after the document loads and renders the "base page"(html elements to create the DOM), no css and js. The "window load event fires" which means the document.ready then gets executed then TA-DA?
[16:16:57] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:17:03] <CuriousMind> sigh robertmaxrees
[16:17:23] <robertmaxrees> document ready fires while everything else is still loading.
[16:18:01] <robertmaxrees> so the html gets downloaded and parsed - document ready fires while the browser is till downloading css, js, images, etc.  then the window load event fires.
[16:18:54] <CuriousMind> Ok I understand everything now robertmaxrees EXCEPT "then the window load event fires"
[16:18:57] <CuriousMind> what does that mean?
[16:19:17] <robertmaxrees> similar to document ready, there's a later event called the "window load" event that fires.
[16:20:41] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Ok I see. window load
[16:21:36] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: If you don't mind me asking, what is window.load? Window?
[16:21:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:21:54] <robertmaxrees> the window object emits the event
[16:22:02] <robertmaxrees> the event is named "load"
[16:22:21] <robertmaxrees> don't worry about window load though - just know it's there and that it's different.
[16:22:27] <robertmaxrees> you won't need to worry about it for a loooong time.
[16:22:57] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Ah ok ok one more question I just wanna learn and know
[16:23:02] <CuriousMind> so window.load loads the window?
[16:23:10] <CuriousMind> What is it loading robertmaxrees ?
[16:23:20] <taplar> your not limited to questions dude.  ask away, :P
[16:23:26] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[16:23:29] <robertmaxrees> "so the html gets downloaded and parsed - document ready fires while the browser is till downloading css, js, images, etc.  then the window load event fires."
[16:23:29] <CuriousMind> taplar: Oh ok lol thanks haha
[16:23:35] <robertmaxrees> css, img, js, etc.
[16:23:40] <robertmaxrees> aka "external assets"
[16:23:47] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: wait hold on
[16:23:59] <CuriousMind> I am confused now
[16:24:15] <robertmaxrees> *css js and imgs that you're loading from other files.
[16:24:26] <CuriousMind> window.load loads the external assets? doesnt the html get loaded first then the css etc? Or does window.load load everything? robertmaxrees
[16:24:29] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:24:32] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't load anything.
[16:24:38] <robertmaxrees> it fires when the content has loaded.
[16:24:42] <taplar> load is an event
[16:24:47] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[16:24:53] <CuriousMind> which does?
[16:24:55] <taplar> a way for the window to say, hey i'm done
[16:25:01] <CuriousMind> Ummmmm
[16:25:03] <taplar> i've loaded all the stuff
[16:25:04] <robertmaxrees> it's like document ready.
[16:25:10] <robertmaxrees> it's simply notifying you that something happened.
[16:25:23] <CuriousMind> So Window.load is the big boss so it loads everything on the page
[16:25:28] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:25:35] <CuriousMind> Man Im bad with this >:(
[16:25:40] <robertmaxrees> the window load event is just a notification.
[16:25:45] <robertmaxrees> just like document ready.
[16:25:52] <CuriousMind> It's just an notification ok I see
[16:25:57] <robertmaxrees> just like document ready is.
[16:26:16] <CuriousMind> How do I know when window.load fires off. Does it send something to the console?
[16:26:23] <robertmaxrees> you subscribe to it.
[16:26:26] <robertmaxrees> like other events.
[16:26:36] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: So I have to call it or something?
[16:26:50] <robertmaxrees> notice how i keep saying "just like document ready"?
[16:27:01] <taplar> $(element|selector).on(event, eventHandler);
[16:27:19] <taplar> Hey, for this guy, when this event happens, do this handler
[16:27:27] <robertmaxrees> *unless it's document ready, in which case you want $(document).ready(eventHandler)
[16:27:28] <taplar> whenever, if ever
[16:27:46] <CuriousMind> Man I dont get this, I'll get it one day
[16:27:50] <CuriousMind> Ok sooo
[16:28:18] <CuriousMind> Window.load is a notification to tell us humans that the page loaded. "We subscribe to it" Dont know what that means but ok
[16:28:21] <CuriousMind> Am i right
[16:28:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:28:41] <robertmaxrees> $(document).ready() lets you subscribe to the document ready evemt
[16:28:49] <robertmaxrees> very similar concept, just later in the process.
[16:29:34] <CuriousMind> How do I know when the window.load method works
[16:29:42] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:29:51] <robertmaxrees> it almost always does unless something went very wrong.
[16:29:54] <CuriousMind> I would know when document.ready works cause window.load had to work before
[16:29:57] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Right
[16:30:01] <robertmaxrees> other way around.
[16:30:09] <robertmaxrees> document reayd happens before window load.
[16:30:28] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:30:34] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Ok so document and window are DOM objects and window is in the document?
[16:30:41] <CuriousMind> Wiat dont go im about to go home! r3ply
[16:30:43] <CuriousMind> Robdgreat:
[16:30:47] <CuriousMind> Aw dang lol
[16:30:49] <taplar> document belongs to window
[16:30:56] <taplar> window is your top level
[16:31:06] <CuriousMind> So why would the document load first if window is top dog
[16:31:09] <CuriousMind> I dont get this
[16:31:17] <taplar> your window loads your document
[16:31:28] <taplar> you can associate window with the browser/tab
[16:31:34] <taplar> document is your html page
[16:31:39] <CuriousMind> taplar: THANK YOU THAT SIMPLE
[16:31:45] <taplar> :)
[16:31:48] <CuriousMind> window is the tab and document is the html page
[16:31:52] <taplar> yep
[16:31:53] <CuriousMind> SIMPLE SIMPLE SIM-PLE
[16:31:54] <robertmaxrees> oh hah.
[16:31:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:32:09] <CuriousMind> This guy talking idk what the hell he was saying
[16:32:16] <CuriousMind> Ok so lets see
[16:32:17] <robertmaxrees> hello
[16:32:31] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Hi I still dont understand but now I do
[16:32:44] <CuriousMind> window is the tab and document is the html page
[16:32:47] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:33:15] <CuriousMind> When document.ready loads and everything window.load sends a notification hi im done
[16:33:26] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:33:30] <CuriousMind> My question is
[16:33:45] <CuriousMind> window.load Where is this notification
[16:33:53] <CuriousMind> I would like to see it please
[16:33:56] <robertmaxrees> $(window).on('load', code)
[16:34:00] <robertmaxrees> you subscribe to it.
[16:34:03] <robertmaxrees> just like document ready.
[16:34:12] <CuriousMind> subscribe to it meaning I have to invoke the method/function?
[16:34:22] <robertmaxrees> meaning you do  $(window).on('load', code)
[16:34:32] <robertmaxrees> where code is your function you want to run in response to that event.
[16:34:58] <CuriousMind> uhhh
[16:35:10] <CuriousMind> ok I am 85 percent understanding this
[16:35:14] <CuriousMind> We making progress
[16:35:19] <robertmaxrees> so go back.
[16:35:27] <robertmaxrees> document ready - how'd you handle that?
[16:36:13] <CuriousMind> document.ready works because when the DOM elements gets loaded to the html page. No css, and no js
[16:36:21] <robertmaxrees> but how did you subscribe to it?
[16:36:31] <CuriousMind> window.load?
[16:36:33] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:36:47] <CuriousMind> dammit
[16:37:00] <CuriousMind> I'm going home, I'll be in the chat later or tomorrow
[16:37:00] <robertmaxrees>  $(document).ready(function(){ /* get stuff from a ready dom */ });
[16:37:03] <robertmaxrees> remember this guy?
[16:37:07] <CuriousMind> yes sir robertmaxrees
[16:37:16] <robertmaxrees> that's how you subscribe to the document ready.
[16:37:40] <CuriousMind> What does subscribe mean? It means to invoke that function/method right?
[16:37:54] <CuriousMind> to call it
[16:38:05] <taplar> What do you think of when someone subscribes to a newspaper?
[16:38:20] <taplar> Or an email listing
[16:38:25] <taplar> What's happening?
[16:38:25] <robertmaxrees> "when this thing happens, do this other thing"
[16:38:26] <CuriousMind> They get newspaper each week, they get something on a daily basis
[16:38:32] <taplar> but how?
[16:38:39] <CuriousMind> someone gives it to them
[16:38:44] <taplar> how do they know to?
[16:39:00] <CuriousMind> someone sends them something
[16:39:16] <taplar> 'someone'  'them'
[16:39:17] <taplar> ?
[16:39:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:39:28] <CuriousMind> Someone knocks on their door like hello heres your newspaper bye
[16:39:30] <CuriousMind> like that
[16:39:35] <taplar> nope
[16:39:37] <taplar> that's a delivery
[16:39:39] <CuriousMind> what the fuck
[16:39:41] <CuriousMind> lol
[16:39:50] <taplar> how did the newspaper person know that person needed the newspaper?
[16:39:56] <CuriousMind> they signed up
[16:39:59] <taplar> boom
[16:40:02] <CuriousMind> yes!
[16:40:03] <taplar> they told them
[16:40:08] <taplar> that's is subscribing
[16:40:25] <taplar> hey, when something is available, i want it
[16:40:39] <CuriousMind> Ohhhh ok
[16:40:40] <taplar> subscribing in javascript is the same thing
[16:40:48] <taplar> hey, when an event happens, i want to know
[16:41:15] <CuriousMind> So when you "subscribe" to something using a function, you use that function cause you sign up to get something. You are requesting something
[16:41:31] <CuriousMind> And if it is ready, it will tell you info, output. If it's not ready, it will tell you as well
[16:41:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:41:50] <robertmaxrees> if it doesn't happen, nothing happens.
[16:42:11] <CuriousMind> nothing happens because the thing you subscribed for wasnt there robertmaxrees
[16:42:27] <taplar> can't get a newspaper if a newspaper doesn't exist yet
[16:42:36] <CuriousMind> taplar: true
[16:42:51] <robertmaxrees> also can't get todays newspaper if you subscribed after it was sent.
[16:42:57] <taplar> ^
[16:43:00] <CuriousMind> true
[16:43:11] <CuriousMind> Ok lets try again
[16:43:38] <CuriousMind> subscribe is when you request for something in the DOM
[16:43:47] <CuriousMind> correct? taplar robertmaxrees
[16:43:49] <robertmaxrees> *an event.
[16:43:56] <robertmaxrees> you subscribe to events.
[16:44:11] <CuriousMind> request for whether an event happened in the DOM?
[16:44:17] <taplar> when
[16:44:28] <CuriousMind> to request when an event happens in the DOM?
[16:44:33] <taplar> yep
[16:44:51] <CuriousMind> so I type this command window.load etc etc. When the event happens, I'll get a response?
[16:45:01] <CuriousMind> If it didn't happen, nothing happens I guess?
[16:45:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:45:11] <robertmaxrees> *if it doesn't happen
[16:45:52] <taplar> $(forecast).on('rain prediction', function(){ var useUmbrela = true; });
[16:46:09] <robertmaxrees> boom
[16:46:33] <robertmaxrees> $(thisThing).on('thiseEvent', doThisInResponse)
[16:46:52] <CuriousMind> So I'll get a response? After window.load etc etc, when the event fires output will appear in console.log and if the event doesn't exist then when I do window.load nothing will ever happen
[16:47:51] <robertmaxrees> if it never fires.
[16:48:01] <robertmaxrees> you're saying "let me know when this thing happens"
[16:48:16] <CuriousMind> ohhh I think I understand more so window.load, .load is an event listener?
[16:48:22] <CuriousMind> thats why we talking about .on now?
[16:48:42] <robertmaxrees> it's a shortcut for .on() yeah
[16:48:49] <taplar> window is the object, load is the event on the object
[16:48:53] <CuriousMind> .on which is also an event listener
[16:49:13] <taplar> on() is a method, which creates an event binding
[16:49:37] <CuriousMind> event binding and event listener are two different things
[16:49:48] <taplar> same thing really
[16:49:54] <CuriousMind> wat
[16:49:55] <robertmaxrees> well, you give a listener to your binding.
[16:50:09] <CuriousMind> window gets a listener through .on
[16:50:16] <robertmaxrees> $(theTHing).on('theEvent', theListener);
[16:50:18] <robertmaxrees> that's a binding.
[16:50:22] <taplar> ^
[16:50:27] <CuriousMind> Hmmmm I see
[16:50:45] <CuriousMind> Ok one more time with window.load and document.ready
[16:51:01] <taplar> $(window).on('load', ...)
[16:51:11] <CuriousMind> document.ready gets executed then you subscribe to window.load to see if document.ready worked. It sends you a notfication
[16:51:42] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:51:49] <CuriousMind> yoo im done
[16:51:52] <robertmaxrees> document ready and window load will both fire notifications
[16:52:05] <robertmaxrees> they;re just different points in the lifecycle for the page.
[16:53:06] <CuriousMind> "document ready and window load will both fire notifications" <- when they are done correct?
[16:53:20] <CuriousMind> document.ready comes first then window.load comes second
[16:53:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:53:39] <CuriousMind> finally yes
[16:53:52] <CuriousMind> in order to get these notifications, I have to subscribe to them?
[16:54:01] <taplar> if you need to, yes
[16:54:10] <taplar> it's not a requirement
[16:54:17] <CuriousMind> How else would I get the notifications if I dont subscribe to them using some function
[16:54:20] <CuriousMind> or method
[16:54:26] <taplar> the point is, you may not need them
[16:54:33] <taplar> if you do, then yes.
[16:54:52] <taplar> like, i'm rarely concerned with load
[16:54:57] <taplar> more so doc ready
[16:55:08] <CuriousMind> I may not need the notifications ok understandable. If I do need them then I do some code to get output from console which would tell me etc
[16:55:17] <taplar> not from console
[16:55:22] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to output to the console fwiw.
[16:55:31] <CuriousMind> fwiw?
[16:55:33] <taplar> you can't event get output from the console, :)
[16:55:37] <robertmaxrees> for what it's worth.
[16:55:39] <taplar> event=even
[16:55:50] <robertmaxrees> but you can declare functions and stuff before and then put code inside the handler that you need to run on ready or wahtever.
[16:56:17] <CuriousMind> on ready means when the DOM elements have rendered and loaded correct?
[16:56:25] <taplar> loaded into the DOM
[16:56:31] <CuriousMind> loaded into the DOM
[16:56:33] <CuriousMind> ok got it
[16:56:43] <taplar> you may not have images and other things loaded yet
[16:56:52] <taplar> but you can still find their related elements in the dom
[16:57:02] <CuriousMind> im going home this is a lot to retain ok so one more time
[16:57:15] <CuriousMind> can you tell me one more time before I go how window.load and document.ready connect
[16:57:26] <CuriousMind> in detail if you want/can pleas
[16:57:59] <taplar> document ready is saying to delay execution of some code until the document is parse into the DOM
[16:58:19] <taplar> window load is saying to delay execution of some code until all resources of the page are loaded
[16:58:49] <CuriousMind> taplar: Those resources are html, css, images. external elements
[16:58:55] <taplar> everything
[16:59:03] <CuriousMind> What code is being delayed? taplar
[16:59:13] <taplar> your listener you bind
[16:59:17] <robertmaxrees> the code in the callback - $(window).on('load', callback)
[16:59:53] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Ok so how does window.load connect to document.ready again?
[17:00:01] <taplar> lol, scroll up dude
[17:00:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:00:36] <robertmaxrees> already explained a few times.
[17:00:43] <taplar> your while(true); looping, ;)
[17:01:01] <CuriousMind> So window.load delays code so that resources get loaded
[17:01:08] <taplar> until
[17:01:10] <robertmaxrees> *until they get loaded, yes.
[17:01:11] <taplar> not so that
[17:01:31] <taplar> your browser is going to do its shit regardless
[17:01:43] <taplar> your hooking in so you can do stuff when your ready
[17:01:49] <CuriousMind> so the code that may be delayed may be the code that I write which I want to execute to/on the DOM elements?
[17:02:04] <taplar> will be the code
[17:03:09] <CuriousMind> ok im going home i get 50% of this shit now
[17:03:15] <CuriousMind> I understood more then before so that is a win
[17:03:19] <CuriousMind> thank you guys thank you everyone
[17:03:23] <CuriousMind> Learning is awesome
[17:05:25] <CuriousMind> ok bye have a good day gg
[17:43:18] <lulul> guys on the following code http://notey.it/n/dGQ2 it loads the ajax response but after it loads it doesn't change my field value any ideas why?
[17:43:49] <robertmaxrees> $('#survey_question_fieldType').val(fieldId); this?
[17:44:01] <robertmaxrees> $(this).data('field-id'); is your problem.
[17:44:04] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the ajax call.
[17:44:07] <robertmaxrees> not the element you clicked.
[17:44:26] <robertmaxrees> add a var $this = $(this); before the ajax calla nd then do $this.data('field-id') instead
[17:58:08] <lulul> robertmaxrees didn't even notice :D
[17:58:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:58:27] <lulul> robertmaxrees at first i wasn't loading by ajax after that changed and forgot about this there
[17:58:36] <robertmaxrees> ah
[18:00:04] <lulul> robertmaxrees woke up few minutes ago xD trying to finish up this then again going to sleep :)
[18:42:26] <snapsisy> hello,everyone
[18:43:01] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[18:58:30] <fred-fri> not sure how to add rows to table using jquery, anyone? http://pastebin.com/mAhZCHD4
[18:59:03] <robertmaxrees> why are you using $(window).scroll(function () { ?
[18:59:27] <robertmaxrees> and what have you tried with the data you get back?
[18:59:39] <robertmaxrees> also: that data format is really strainge.
[18:59:58] <taplar> looks invalid
[19:00:02] <robertmaxrees> {[{id:2, name:Mary}, {id:3, name:Peter}]} isn't a valid object.
[19:00:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[19:00:32] <taplar> outer {} needs removed or a key added
[19:00:49] <robertmaxrees> go with the former imo
[19:01:37] <taplar> and two other things.  avoid doing lookups in a scroll handler. and you going to want to throttle/debounce that script
[19:01:51] <robertmaxrees> though i'm lost - why are you using a scroll handler for it?
[19:02:21] <WhirledPress> if you create an new Image() element, wrap it in jquery can't you remove it? $(new Image()).remove();
[19:02:42] <taplar> why would you want to?
[19:02:44] <robertmaxrees> wat
[19:02:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:02:47] <taplar> it's not attached to the dom
[19:04:13] <WhirledPress> right. I am using a deferred promise from a loadImage() function and on failure of load, I have the $(new Image()) jquery object passed to the loadError function
[19:05:03] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:05:04] <robertmaxrees> then what?
[19:05:04] <WhirledPress> I should just delete the jquery object then? what happens to the memory stored by the detached image?
[19:05:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:05:20] <taplar> unreferenced elements get garbage collected
[19:05:23] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:05:29] <robertmaxrees> are you appending that element anywhere?
[19:05:34] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/jnfgmu5y/1/
[19:06:00] <robertmaxrees> you might want to fix that error in your js first.
[19:06:20] <WhirledPress> I was showing you the error. LOL
[19:06:43] <taplar> ln 28
[19:06:53] <robertmaxrees> img.();
[19:06:56] <robertmaxrees> that's not a thing.
[19:07:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:07:38] <WhirledPress> that's where it said img.remove() but was returning an error
[19:08:07] <taplar> so like robert asked.  were are you attaching it to the dom?
[19:08:52] <robertmaxrees> also: loadSuccess is getting the event object.
[19:08:54] <robertmaxrees> not the image.
[19:08:58] <robertmaxrees> img.on({load:loadSuccess, loadError});
[19:09:12] <robertmaxrees> oh, it's getting nothing.
[19:09:15] <shoky> shouldn't that be  img.on({load:loadSuccess, error: loadError})
[19:09:16] <robertmaxrees> loadSuccess();
[19:09:36] <robertmaxrees> so you're doing loadSuccess = function(img) {} but then never passing that as an argument.
[19:09:40] <robertmaxrees> so img is undefined.
[19:09:46] <WhirledPress> I used to have img.load(loadsuccess, loaderror) and it worked.
[19:09:56] <robertmaxrees> your code would still error.
[19:09:59] <robertmaxrees> loadSuccess = function() {
[19:10:01] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[19:10:03] <shoky> just remove `img`  from your function(img)
[19:10:09] <shoky> you already can access it via closure
[19:10:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:10:17] <robertmaxrees> and you're not passing it anyway.
[19:10:38] <taplar> lol ln 6
[19:10:44] <taplar> deja view
[19:10:52] <taplar> vue
[19:10:56] <robertmaxrees> woah nested ternaries?
[19:10:58] <robertmaxrees> D:
[19:11:06] <shoky> WhirledPress: it didn't work, that would not call your error handler if there's an error
[19:13:40] <taplar> i'm so confused
[19:13:49] <robertmaxrees> lol this code is really strange
[19:14:04] <taplar> in the first method, if targ has elements, it is returning
[19:14:12] <taplar> but the afterwards it tries to use that variable
[19:14:15] <taplar> which would be empty...
[19:14:39] <taplar> it's even trying to get data values off of an empty jquery object
[19:14:45] <taplar> -_-
[19:15:07] <taplar> oh wait, hah. > 1, nvm
[19:15:08] <shoky> taplar: it's > 1
[19:15:10] <shoky> :p
[19:15:16] <taplar> gah, can i go home yet?
[19:15:32] <shoky> no, sit.
[19:15:43] <taplar> :'(
[19:16:14] <shoky> good boy
[19:17:10] <WhirledPress> Not sure why I thought img.load(loadsuccess, loaderror) would pass the img and not an event.
[19:17:29] <shoky> wrong arguments, too
[19:20:08] <lulul> :)))
[19:20:16] <lulul> <taplar> gah, can i go home yet?
[19:20:16] <lulul> <shoky> no, sit.
[19:20:16] <lulul> <taplar> :'(
[19:20:16] <lulul> <shoky> good boy
[19:20:17] <lulul> =))))
[19:20:20] <lulul> omg guys
[19:20:27] <taplar> ?
[19:20:31] <shoky> uhm
[19:21:16] <taplar> you find my suffering entertaining?
[19:21:21] <taplar> terrible person!
[19:22:10] <lulul> :)
[19:22:16] <lulul> good night everyone :)
[19:23:06] <WhirledPress> so img.load(loadSuccess).error(loadError) won't work. How do I trigger load error then?
[19:23:54] <shoky> that should work although those are deprecated
[19:24:09] <shoky> .on({load: loadSuccess, error: loadError})
[19:24:10] * WhirledPress is deprecated
[19:25:20] <WhirledPress> and that will pass an event object to loadSuccess and loadError, right?
[19:25:41] <shoky> yea
[19:28:11] <shoky> WhirledPress: btw.. $(fg, bgf, bgb)  is not how to put multiple elements in one jquery object
[19:28:25] <shoky> fg.add(bgf).add(bgb)  would work
[19:33:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jnfgmu5y/8/ some refactoring started
[19:52:59] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jnfgmu5y/11/ ?
[19:57:25] <WhirledPress> line 23, if url===undefined and $element.data('src') is not defined, url won't be null will it?
[19:57:39] <robertmaxrees> if (!url
[19:57:51] <WhirledPress> maybe url=url||$element.data(src)||null;
[19:58:04] <robertmaxrees> why would you set to null?
[19:58:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jnfgmu5y/12/
[19:59:07] <WhirledPress> robertmaxrees, i guess I was trying to avoid having a data-src='' property on an image.
[19:59:28] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to build, out of curiosity?
[19:59:37] <taplar> looks like a pre loader
[19:59:43] <robertmaxrees> an iamge preloader?
[20:00:10] * taplar escapes from the shoky
[20:00:12] <taplar> later all
[20:00:25] <WhirledPress> taplar, thanks for your help.
[20:01:03] <WhirledPress> robertmaxrees, I was trying to make a preloader that returned a promise so you could tell when all images were loaded.
[20:02:19] <robertmaxrees> why do oyu need a preloader?
[20:05:01] <WhirledPress> I'm doing this stupid multi-level animation thing that I thought it would be nice to preload the images so it didn't screw up.
[20:05:28] <robertmaxrees> why not just load on demand?
[20:07:26] <WhirledPress> I was expecting that it would be nice to handle load errors to avoid missing part of the animation. So I also figured it would be a good time to learn about deferreds.
[21:10:41] <cwolter> hi
[21:11:16] <cwolter> i have an issue with jquery that i'm doing for an assignment
[21:11:47] <taplar> sup?
[21:12:37] <cwolter> i am trying to create a grocery list maker for a jquery assignment
[21:12:48] <cwolter> i did it in javascript and now need to redo it in jquery
[21:12:58] <cwolter> i'm having trouble with removing items from the list
[21:13:03] <cwolter> $('li').click(function(){ 		$(this).remove(this); 		$('#grocery').focus(); 	});
[21:13:08] <cwolter> this is the code I am using
[21:13:26] <taplar> 'this' would be the li in the click handler
[21:13:33] <cwolter> the <li> tag is created when the "add" button is clicked to add the input to the textbox
[21:13:50] <cwolter> ok
[21:14:04] <taplar> if your wanting to remove the li clicked, $(this).remove().  no need to give it a parameter
[21:14:18] <cwolter> so it should read $(this).click(function()
[21:14:46] <cwolter> i've tried it without a parameter
[21:14:52] <cwolter> it doesn't seem to work
[21:15:10] <taplar> can you make a fiddle with your problem?  are you seeing any errors in your console?
[21:15:26] <taplar> oh
[21:15:27] <taplar> wait
[21:15:34] <taplar> your dynamically creating li's?
[21:15:53] <cwolter> i don't really understand debugging with console
[21:16:00] <cwolter> i will put up a jsfiddle
[21:16:12] <cwolter> the click event isn't triggering on the created li item
[21:16:24] <taplar> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 good resource for debugging intro
[21:16:47] <taplar> as far as your issue, most likely you are binding before you create the elements so the binding will not be on the new ones
[21:17:26] <taplar> in regards to that, i would suggest reading up on delegated listeners: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[21:19:40] <cwolter> https://jsfiddle.net/3nhctk0d/1/
[21:19:50] <cwolter> not sure if i set it up right on jsfiddle
[21:20:02] <cwolter> it prompted me to remove my head and html tags in the html
[21:20:21] <taplar> yep, read up on event delegation.
[21:20:23] <cwolter> the only part not working is my final click event to remove the dynamically created li
[21:21:14] <cwolter> i tried to place it outside the ready function. i thought maybe when it was made ready, the li didn't exist so it wouldn't work
[21:21:21] <cwolter> but i'm not sure that logic is correct
[21:21:42] <taplar> *points to the event-delegation link*  your answers await
[21:21:57] <cwolter> i will read it
[21:22:02] <cwolter> am i at least on the right track?
[21:22:27] <taplar> your close from what i can see
[21:23:27] <cwolter> ok, thanks, i will read and see what i can discern
[21:24:03] <taplar> sure, if you have questions afterwards, feel free to ask.  i'm just holding back since it's a homework assignment
[21:27:36] <cwolter> i appreciate that, i like to know and understand
[21:27:45] <cwolter> i'm not sure i'm grasping how the event delagation applies
[21:27:52] <cwolter> i'm not looking for event propogation
[21:27:57] <taplar> but you are
[21:28:07] <taplar> the issue is that your li's are generated dynamically
[21:28:07] <cwolter> merely to remove the dynamically created li when clicked
[21:28:17] <cwolter> ok
[21:28:22] <cwolter> i understand that
[21:28:25] <taplar> when you do $(selector).on(event, eventHandler)
[21:28:33] <taplar> your attaching that eventHandler on those element
[21:28:37] <taplar> *s
[21:28:42] <taplar> but only the ones it finds
[21:28:45] <taplar> not future ones
[21:29:01] <taplar> event delegation is a way to bind that accounts for future elements
[21:29:11] <taplar> it relies on the event to propagate up to a shared parent
[21:29:15] <cwolter> ok
[21:30:07] <cwolter> you mention .on(event, eventHandler)
[21:30:16] <taplar> yep, you should use on() instead of click()
[21:30:33] <cwolter> i used .onclick in javascript...
[21:30:44] <taplar> right, you want to use on() in jquery
[21:30:56] <taplar> instead of putting the listener on the element directly
[21:31:00] <cwolter> is click() not specific enough or how come?
[21:31:05] <cwolter> ok
[21:31:13] <taplar> click() is a wrapper for on(), and does not support delegates
[21:32:11] <cwolter> so it should be written $('li').on(click, function?)
[21:32:36] <taplar> yep, but that's the non-delegated version.  keep reading that page to see examples
[21:33:19] <cwolter> ok, i will come back if i still don't grasp it
[21:33:58] <cwolter> you've helped a ton already, i'm taking the class online for a summer class and the text and modules for the class start above my head as it is
[21:34:13] <taplar> it's cool
[21:34:21] <taplar> s'what the room is here for, :)
[21:34:36] <cwolter> :)
[22:54:34] <CuriousMind> When I press a key, I want to move an html element on the screen. I don't know if I am on the right path but I did $(element).keypress(function() { }); Is that about right?
[22:59:27] <WhirledPress> $(element).on ({keypress:function () {}});
[23:00:42] <WhirledPress> I know .keypress worked a long time and may still work, but by using .on and passing an object, you can check for keyup, keydown, keypress, click, etc. etc. in one object
[23:45:59] <Jerrry> Does anyone know how jquery selects classes and modifies them? I mean if it's more or less efficient than modifying classes using a for loop in vanilla.
[23:54:54] <WhirledPress> jquery is javascript
