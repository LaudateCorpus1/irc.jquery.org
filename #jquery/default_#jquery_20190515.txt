[01:21:03] <Jasein> If I need to capture the scroll event once, how can I unbind a specific bind rather than all bound handlers? $("elem").on("scroll")   then $("elem").off("scroll") is unbinding all scroll handlers.
[01:27:11] <pavonia> Jasein: You can unbind inside of the handler using $(this).off(...), or bind it using .one()
[01:32:29] <Guest79700> learn jquery
[01:55:09] <Cork> Jasein: also you can scope events by adding .scope-name after the event
[01:55:22] <Cork> then you can just do .off('.scope-name') later
[07:43:16] <hirsty> hey all, anyone useful with requirejs?
[08:22:22] <R13ose> Each time I try to get a JSON array to happen using an each loop, I am doing ":" because I am unsure how to do name: value.  The issue is the : and making that appear.  How do I do that?
[08:23:16] <Cork> R13ose: "make a json array happen"??
[08:23:21] <Cork> what exactly are you trying to do?
[08:25:24] <R13ose> Cork: push data I grab from a form to a JSON array so I put this in the right format for Google Sheets.
[08:26:07] <Cork> R13ose: by json array you mean "[1,2,3,4]"?
[08:26:18] <Cork> contra to an array [1,2,3,4]?
[08:27:47] <R13ose> I am trying for  { "First Name": "Bob", "Last Name": "Smith", ...}
[08:28:00] <Cork> ok, so you mean an object
[08:28:39] <Cork> to build an object just do var obj = {}; /* loop */ obj[key] = value;
[08:32:35] <R13ose> Oh my gosh, that worked
[08:32:42] <R13ose> I so misunderstood yesterday
[08:33:13] <R13ose> Cork: thanks
[08:35:12] <R13ose> How do I take a variable and push this as the first item in the array?
[08:38:30] <hollusion> anybody using latest select2 in here?
[08:38:54] <hollusion> do you experience a bug where the dropdown will not hide if the input loses focus?
[08:39:08] <hollusion> somehow it forces to keep focus
[08:46:13] <Cork> R13ose: .push() to add it to the end and .unshift() to push it from the beginning
[08:46:34] <Cork> (avoid using [] = for arrays)
[08:46:50] <Cork> as it is very easy to get holes in the array if you do
[08:47:44] <R13ose> Why are {} better?
[08:49:10] <Cork> {} isn't arrays
[08:49:24] <Cork> {} is an object it is a key: value pair
[08:49:33] <Cork> array is [] and it is just a list of values
[08:49:46] <hollusion> he/she needs a guide explaining the basics
[08:50:07] <R13ose> I am learning
[08:50:16] <Cork> hollusion: i'm quite sure this is comming from php, it is a very common mistake from them mixing up the terms
[08:51:11] <hollusion> oh god ... dont remind me of these->stupid->objects->in->php
[08:51:45] <Cork> hollusion: i mean more arra("key" => "value") => object
[08:51:51] <Cork> array*
[08:52:02] <R13ose> I have done these before
[08:52:31] <Cork> so php array(1,2,3,4) => array; array("key" => "value") => object
[08:52:56] <Cork> so it isn't that strainge if php developsers don't understand that they aren't the same thing
[08:53:07] <Cork> (aren't the same in any other language then php)
[08:53:46] <Cork> other languages usually call it object, hash or hashMaps
[08:53:52] <Cork> while php is just "array" :/
[08:54:56] <thykka> php doesn't care, it does it's own thing
[08:55:14] <Cork> exactly
[08:55:24] <Cork> that is what i just said :)
[08:55:35] <thykka> and what about jQuery? Putting .map parameters the wrong way round like it ain't no thang
[08:55:52] <Cork> thykka: ya, that is actually a legacy choice
[08:56:02] <Cork> the developers has actually commented on it
[08:56:24] <thykka> of course it's a legacy choice, jQuery is a legacy library :D
[08:56:51] <thykka> same thing could probably be said about a lot of PHPs weird decisions
[08:56:52] <Cork> eh, not really
[08:57:15] <Cork> thykka: well this wasn't really the point of the discussion though
[08:57:19] <thykka> so you're saying you would include jQuery in a new project?
[08:57:49] <Cork> sure
[08:57:54] <thykka> we-ird.
[08:57:59] <thykka> why
[08:58:10] <Cork> it all depends on what the project is meant to do
[08:58:44] <R13ose> Can I use a variable across multiple js pages? If yes, is that wrong?
[08:58:45] <Cork> well dom selection is still nicer to work with, and the none crashing nesting makes code MUCH easier to read
[08:58:50] <thykka> for me, pretty much the only consideration is whether it's already there. If it's not, there's no point in bringing it aboard
[08:58:59] <Cork> R13ose: js runs in the page, so no
[08:59:32] <thykka> you can store things in localStorage or sessionStorage, if you really need persistent values
[08:59:41] <Cork> thykka: definitely true for -ui, but for jquery core, not really; i wouldn't use it in a es6+ environment
[08:59:49] <Cork> but for legacy web, sure it still makes sense
[09:00:00] <thykka> as I said, it's a legacy library :)
[09:00:09] <thykka> for legacy projects
[09:00:13] <Cork> thykka: if you call the entire web for legacy then ... ya
[09:00:55] <thykka> that's an overgeneralisation though. Sure, the percentage of sites made in jQuery-era is still large, but if you look at recently built sites...
[09:53:03] <hollusion> thykka, what would you use instead of jquery?
[09:53:38] <thykka> native DOM methods for the most part. Then there are certain specialized libraries I might use on a case-by-case basis
[09:53:59] <hollusion> native methods for selecting html elements?
[09:54:04] <hollusion> its a pain
[09:54:04] <thykka> yes?
[09:54:06] <thykka> how so?
[09:54:08] <hollusion> compared to jquery
[09:54:24] <hollusion> getElementBy and allt hat jazz
[09:54:32] <thykka> ??
[09:54:39] <hollusion> or am i misunderstanding?
[09:55:31] <thykka> idk, I don't find native selecting methods painful at all, quite the contrary
[09:56:23] <hollusion> $('.element:eq(2)').parents('.parent')
[09:56:36] <hollusion> this wouldnt be nice in native code, would it?
[09:56:45] <thykka> what I do find painful is chaining tens of methods together, then debugging the mess later
[09:58:12] <thykka> document.querySelectorAll('.element')[2].closest('.parent')
[09:58:51] <thykka> not that I'd ever write something like that in production..
[09:59:17] <thykka> DOM traversal is not a great way to arrange a project's structure, IMO
[09:59:17] <hollusion> are those methods kinda new?
[09:59:25] <thykka> hardly new
[09:59:41] <thykka> .closest isn't supported by some IEs
[09:59:47] <thykka> but it's trivial to polygill
[09:59:48] <hollusion> document.querySelectorAll('.element') vs $('.element')
[09:59:59] <hollusion> but i get you could easily write wrapper functions for those
[10:00:07] <hollusion> but then again, thats what jquery does in the end
[10:00:19] <hollusion> *but i guess
[10:00:21] <thykka> don't mistake terseness for good code
[10:00:28] <R13ose> I tried to do items.unshift(data) where data is a var but says typeerror items.unshift is not a function.  Data is an email address.  What am I doing wrong?
[10:00:41] <hollusion> items has to be an array
[10:00:46] <thykka> R13ose, .unshift is an array method
[10:01:44] <R13ose> Understandable
[10:02:13] <hollusion> http://dpaste.com/
[10:02:24] <hollusion> you can paste your code on that website and shere the link with us
[10:02:28] <hollusion> *share
[10:04:06] <Cork> R13ose: if you just want to remove a key from an object use delete obj[key]
[10:04:43] <R13ose> Why doesn't var data = {}; data[$("#email")[0].name()] = $("#email").val(); work?
[10:05:04] <Cork> nam() isn't a dom method
[10:05:15] <Cork> name*
[10:06:00] <Cork> R13ose: are you just trying to serialize a form?
[10:06:21] <Cork> cause then you might just want to use .serialize() or serializeArray() instead
[10:09:41] <R13ose> Yes
[10:10:23] <hollusion> var data = $('form').serializeArray(); console.log(data)
[10:18:21] <R13ose> Here is my code: https://pastebin.com/KDDfy1qb
[10:20:50] <hollusion> paste the html too
[10:20:56] <hollusion> or even better, build a jsfiddle
[10:21:05] <hollusion> https://jsfiddle.net/
[10:21:14] <R13ose> Okay
[10:21:43] <thykka> inb4 all the html, css and js is in the html box
[10:21:57] <thykka> including <head>
[10:22:05] <hollusion> :)
[10:24:05] <R13ose> Hahaha
[10:25:59] <R13ose> https://jsfiddle.net/wfe17429/1/
[10:29:10] <hollusion> you madman :D
[10:31:25] <R13ose> I am so mad :)
[10:32:05] <hollusion> ok and what are you trying to acheive?
[10:36:33] <R13ose> All I want is to get the variable that I save from the modal window into the items array as first item.  I know this is happening already but I want to change $("form") to $form so only to get the form where the button is located.
[10:38:57] <hollusion> https://jsfiddle.net/m7gu2vh1/
[10:39:00] <hollusion> maybe this helps?
[10:39:35] <hollusion> it will show you the content of "var data"
[10:42:46] <hollusion> you could set the value of a hidden input in your main form
[10:43:07] <hollusion> <input type="hidden" name="emailFromModal" value="">
[10:43:28] <hollusion> var x = $("form").serializeArray();
[10:43:30] <R13ose> Yes but there will be multiple forms not just one.
[10:43:33] <hollusion> try to be more specific here
[10:43:42] <hollusion> $('form') will select ALL forms on the page
[10:43:48] <R13ose> I know
[10:46:18] <R13ose> This is why I feel I need to store the variable the way I am
[10:46:30] <hollusion> there is no need to do $.each()
[10:46:36] <hollusion> to collect all input data values
[10:46:42] <hollusion> var x = $("form").serializeArray();
[10:46:49] <hollusion> will already have everything
[10:48:13] <hollusion> if you prefer to have a serialized object
[10:48:14] <hollusion> https://www.npmjs.com/package/form-serializer
[10:50:44] <R13ose> Well what do I put in var jqxhr instead of items if I take that out?
[10:53:45] <R13ose> hollusion: do you get what I want to do?
[10:53:56] <hollusion> x
[10:54:44] <hollusion> $.post(url, x, function(data) {
[10:55:00] <hollusion> you dont really need to assign it to a variable
[10:55:05] <hollusion> no need for "var jqxhr = "
[10:55:40] <hollusion> of course you can also do: var item = $("form").serializeArray(); $.post(url, items, function(data) { ...
[10:55:46] <hollusion> *var items =
[10:59:04] <R13ose> That worked
[11:00:12] <R13ose> Yet, I want to push the variable in the modal window as the first item which is not happening at the moment.
[11:01:12] <hollusion> you could get the data from all the forms separately
[11:01:18] <hollusion> and then merge those into one array
[11:01:59] <z1haze> is there a jquery method to root text of an element but not change any html? eg if you have a <button><span class="lock"></span> some text</button> and I only want to change the 'some text'?
[11:02:32] <hollusion> $('button').text("new text")
[11:02:42] <z1haze> that wipes out the html though
[11:03:10] <R13ose> hollusion: the way I am doing this will not work?
[11:04:39] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, btw im sorry for the other day.
[11:06:08] <hollusion> R13ose, http://dpaste.com/3SMXG28
[11:06:34] <hollusion> this will result in "var items" havin data from formC at first position
[11:06:40] <hollusion> followed by A then B
[11:07:44] <hollusion> z1haze, you only want to replace the text?
[11:08:09] <hollusion> why not wrap it in an element just like span
[11:08:29] <hollusion> <button><span class="lock"></span><span class="text">some text</span></button>
[11:08:46] <z1haze> no access to the markup
[11:09:07] <hollusion> okay then you do the following
[11:10:46] <z1haze> i got it.
[11:11:10] <robertmaxrees> z1haze :shrug:
[11:11:21] <z1haze> ?
[11:12:00] <robertmaxrees> z1haze been pretty hard on myself lately.  don't need other people adding to that.  remember that you're talking with actual people who may or may not have stuff going on outside of just irc.
[11:12:16] <robertmaxrees> i'm gonna hop off again.
[11:12:25] <z1haze> i apologized. i cna't take it back man
[11:12:26] <robertmaxrees> peace.
[11:12:29] <z1haze> have a good one
[11:12:53] <hollusion> $('button').html($('button').html().replace('some text', 'new text'))
[11:13:02] <z1haze> jesus lol
[11:13:10] <hollusion> is one way to do it
[11:13:15] <z1haze> that's a good effort
[11:13:21] <z1haze> not very dynamic though
[11:13:32] <z1haze> but its a start, nice work
[11:13:42] <z1haze> here's what i did https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/r2ypLf8d/2/
[11:14:37] <hollusion> yeah thats better
[11:15:16] <R13ose> hollusion: I did something similar and came out undefined
[11:15:50] <hollusion> are we supposed to guess what you did? always paste your code :)
[11:16:01] <hollusion> i have to go now, hope somebody else is able to help you
[11:31:35] <R13ose> https://jsfiddle.net/wfe17429/2/ I am trying to make mdata first item in the array and push x items after that but line 95 only outputs 2 which is not the correct JSON array I need.  How do I fix this?
[11:39:53] <z1haze> im afraid to even look if you're making a fiddle that is 90 something lines long
[11:40:22] <z1haze> can you split that up into a small use case
[11:40:26] <z1haze> might help you solve the problem yourself
[11:40:53] <R13ose> I have tried that and didn't help me.
[11:45:46] <z1haze> it would help other people help you. most dont mind helping, but they dont have time to read through hundreds of lines of code to solve your problem.
[11:46:30] <R13ose> True, I understand I will pastebin the code that is my problem now
[11:50:15] <R13ose> Code: https://pastebin.com/BXeEdHcU line 9 is the key one where the console shows output is 2 and is not a JSON Array.
[12:18:21] <z1haze> !pastebin R13ose
[12:18:31] <z1haze> ffs, lol hey R13ose dont use pastebin
[12:19:26] <R13ose> Why?
[12:19:59] <z1haze> we dont like ads
[12:20:13] <z1haze> bpaste.net, dpaste.net, hastebin.com theres a ton haha. just not that one
[12:20:43] <z1haze> can you give some example data for #email and 'form'? i will test this
[12:32:36] <R13ose> This is JSON array data.
[12:39:55] <R13ose> z1haze: ^
[12:42:06] <z1haze> clearly it isnt :D
[12:50:00] <R13ose> joking hahahaha
[13:10:42] <R13ose> z1haze: any updates?
[13:10:55] <z1haze> no, i really need the json
[13:11:27] <z1haze> plus, your paste is deleted
[13:12:25] <R13ose> Let me get you that
[13:16:18] <R13ose> z1haze: https://pastebin.com/QDxBugrE
[13:16:33] <z1haze> and you used pastebin again
[13:16:45] <R13ose> Last time for sure.
[13:20:42] <z1haze> line 9: var items = mdata.push(x); ... array.push returns the length of the array
[13:20:47] <z1haze> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push
[13:21:07] <z1haze> which is why you're getting 2
[13:25:47] <R13ose> Oh, let me try another way
[13:32:18] <R13ose> Thanks z1haze
[13:32:51] <R13ose> z1haze: do you like one site to use for pastes?
[13:33:02] <z1haze> one without ads
[13:33:20] <R13ose> Okay
[13:33:29] <z1haze> i usually use bpaste.net, lots of people use hastebin
[13:33:43] <R13ose> Okay
[14:42:32] <z1haze> does a function exist the find the closest 'prev' matching a certain selector?
[14:42:58] <z1haze> .closest only goes up the dom it doesnt look at siblings, and prev() only seems to go to the 1 prev
[14:44:04] <z1haze> ah prevUntil!
[14:44:09] <R13ose> How do I get the current form and not a specific form?  I will have multiple forms on the page and need to get the form where the button is pressed.  Right now, I am doing $('test-form')
[14:47:07] <z1haze> `live
[14:47:12] <z1haze> do you have an example
[14:48:03] <R13ose> z1haze: do you want code or jsfiddle?
[14:48:11] <z1haze> whatever
[14:48:18] <z1haze> just some context to your question
[14:52:54] <qiller> guys, can i set variable key name dynamically? ex: const DYNAMIC NAME = 123;
[14:55:31] <R13ose> z1haze: https://jsfiddle.net/wfe17429/3/
[14:55:57] <R13ose> Line 15 is where is the form is called
[14:56:02] <z1haze> qiller, yes you can. but dunno what you go going on with your example
[14:57:06] <z1haze> R13ose, you're asking how to get the 'current' form.. you need some sort of event handler for that. or you need to pass the form into the function
[14:58:06] <z1haze> just like you are passing mdata into the function, you can pass the jquery form object in too. or you use some sort of event handler and get it from there
[14:58:21] <qiller> z1haze: i need create variable with name key dynamic, not object.
[15:00:02] <z1haze> quiller state your problem, very likely you're going about it in a more difficultway
[15:00:12] <R13ose> z1haze: what is better to do?
[15:00:26] <z1haze> depends on your use case man.
[15:00:43] <z1haze> when do you want this function to fire?
[15:01:43] <R13ose> z1haze: I want the function to get the form items and there values
[15:02:36] <z1haze> i asked when
[15:03:02] <R13ose> After the submit button is clicked
[15:03:54] <z1haze> are there going to be multiple forms calling this function?
[15:04:24] <R13ose> Yes.
[15:04:50] <z1haze> ok
[15:05:55] <R13ose> I will move the calling the function to inside other functions and out of document ready
[15:06:48] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/nk7e3pag/2/
[15:07:33] <z1haze> thats the gist of it
[15:09:32] <R13ose> What happened to the function testing?
[15:10:36] <R13ose> z1haze: ^
[15:11:44] <z1haze> i moved it into the submit handler..
[15:13:49] <z1haze> you can also do this: https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/nk7e3pag/5/
[15:15:35] <R13ose> z1haze: your code keep looping
[15:18:24] <z1haze> its looping?
[15:18:37] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/nk7e3pag/8/ this may be diffrent
[15:18:53] <z1haze> i dunno i didnt write your code, im just showing you how to encapsulate 'this' with event handlers
[15:49:31] <Justin_T> Hi all

[15:54:41] <Justin_T> nvm, found the error, thanks
[15:55:12] <R13ose> For some reason, my full code doesn't like the new code I added.
[17:43:00] <R13ose> How do I only allow a modal to only do its code when page loads but store a variable for other functions to use?
[17:46:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:46:43] <robertmaxrees> you mean initialize it once and then be able to open/close it as needed?
[17:47:31] <robertmaxrees> R13ose ^
[17:47:50] <R13ose> I mean initialize this once but store whatever is writing in there and use that in other functions on the website.
[17:48:24] <robertmaxrees> still lost - what are you trying to reuse, specifically?
[17:50:12] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're already getting help in ##javascript.  nvm :)
