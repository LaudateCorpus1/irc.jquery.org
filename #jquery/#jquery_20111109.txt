[12:39:56] <aram535> I don't think you can redefine it
[12:40:54] <apollo13> at least if I understood your question correctly ;)
[12:41:41] <aram535> maybe I misunderstood it then
[12:42:33] <ColKurtz> aram so what exactly are you validating it for
[12:42:37] <ColKurtz> you just want to make sure it's not empty?
[12:43:03] <intellilogic> $("#mydiv").click( SomeFunction() );  function SomeFunction(){ $(this).attr('name'); }
[12:43:26] <intellilogic> Well, name attribute was a bad example
[12:43:44] <intellilogic> id attribute would return mydiv
[12:43:55] <intellilogic> Looking @ $.proxy
[12:44:01] <ajpiano> intellilogic: you have to pass a reference to the function, not execute it
[12:44:33] <ajpiano> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[12:46:20] <ColKurtz> aram535, instead of setting the input's value, you should use a label and absolutely position it over the field
[12:46:54] <ColKurtz> aram535, i like this script myself: http://fuelyourcoding.com/scripts/infield/
[12:47:12] <ColKurtz> make sure to give the label a background color and the fade will look better in IE
[12:47:20] <ravenzz> ajpiano so you can pass $(this) to log within the handler function?
[12:47:30] <ajpiano> not sure what you're asking
[12:47:33] <aram535> ColKurtz: nice thanks
[12:47:57] <ravenzz> $('#foo').click(function(){ log($(this)); });
[12:48:16] <ravenzz> ajpiano ^
[12:48:24] <supsup> we got any breaking news in here?  I need some breaking news.
[12:48:30] <ajpiano> ... assuming there's a log function, then yes
[12:48:36] <ravenzz> yes sure
[12:49:05] <intellilogic> ajpiano:  I
[12:49:09] <intellilogic> 'm more confused now
[12:49:14] <intellilogic> (enter fail)
[12:49:22] <ajpiano> intellilogic: function foo() { };  <-- is a function
[12:49:35] <intellilogic> yea
[12:49:40] <ajpiano> $("#bar").click( foo ) ; passing a reference to the 'foo' function
[12:50:04] <ajpiano> $("#bar").click( foo() ); <--- executing the 'foo' function, passing its return value to actually be used as the handler
[12:50:23] <ravenzz> and does it make sense http://pastie.org/2838249 ?
[12:51:01] <ajpiano> yep
[12:51:06] <ajpiano> i would prob do return this.click(fn);
[12:51:11] <ajpiano> instead of returning void and breaking the chain
[12:51:33] <Dave_Stein> or this.bind( 'click', fn )
[12:51:39] <Dave_Stein> boo shortcut functions :)
[12:52:23] <ravenzz> and what if I want to do stuffs within the log function and I don't care about the return value?
[12:52:47] <ajpiano> you can do whatever you want in the log function *and* not break the chain
[12:53:00] <ravenzz> so i shouldn't return at all
[12:53:08] <ajpiano> no, you should return this;
[12:53:12] <ravenzz> ah ok
[12:53:15] <ajpiano> so you dont break the chain
[12:53:17] <ravenzz> ok
[12:53:19] <ravenzz> ty
[12:54:34] <intellilogic> I'd like to see the complete version of that fn.log
[12:54:42] <supsup> how do you assign foo using new Function as a param of another function, or do you have to use two statements?
[13:00:59] <danzik17> i probably already know the answer to this - but i'm assuming jQuery.event.fix is considered internal?
[13:01:46] <iman> Do you have any useful article about, " How to fix element position in any browser and resolution " ? I couldn't found good one in google
[13:02:10] <ajpiano> danzik17: yes
[13:03:43] <danzik17> ajpiano: ok, tks - any input on a clean way to turn a native event into a jQuery event?  use case is tinymce relies on native events, but i need to re-trigger some key events on a different element ( that uses jquery events ).  event.fix would do it, but it's internal like you said
[13:03:59] <ColKurtz> iman, the first thing to do would be to make sure your CSS takes you as far as possible
[13:04:03] <ajpiano> danzik17: i think you can just pass it to the event constructor
[13:04:16] <ajpiano> danzik17: new jQuery.Event( browserEvent );
[13:04:52] <ajpiano> danzik17: you don't even need the new
[13:08:22] <danzik17> ajpiano: seems to have worked, thanks - the triggered event is missing a ton of data, but it looks like it's all available thru .originalEvent
[13:08:37] <ajpiano> yep
[13:08:41] <ajpiano> thats the ticket
[13:12:32] <Eviltwin> danzik17: Welcome to jQuery 1.7
[13:12:54] <danzik17> Eviltwin: ?
[13:13:00] <intellilogic> <3 1.7
[13:13:07] <intellilogic> .on = AWESOME!
[13:18:49] <solidus-river> i want to filter a set of dom elments by which ones actually contain a certain data attribute
[13:18:54] <solidus-river> not a specific value of it, but just that have it
[13:19:00] <solidus-river> is this posible?
[13:19:05] <pifantastic> yes
[13:19:05] <solidus-river> *possible
[13:19:13] <pifantastic> $('div[foo]')
[13:19:33] <pifantastic> $('a').filter('[data-poop'])
[13:19:39] <solidus-river> awesome
[13:21:50] <cyth> okay guys
[13:22:04] <cyth> I need to run a global ajax handler before all the other handlers.
[13:22:17] <cyth> basically checking if the result is successful login or not.
[13:22:39] <cyth> so if the user's session times out on the server side, the ajax can redirect to the login screen
[13:22:50] <solidus-river> hmm, i need to do an set disjunction on arrays of jquery objects
[13:22:51] <cyth> so I tried usign .ajaxComplete, but it seems not to run first.
[13:23:24] <solidus-river> [ob1, ob2, ob3, ob4] - ob2  => [ob1, ob3, ob4]\
[13:24:15] <pifantastic> cyth: http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events
[13:25:34] <cyth> pifantastic, right I get that
[13:25:37] <pifantastic> cyth: oh I see, you want the global handler to run before the local
[13:25:45] <cyth> but how do I get a global handler to run before local ones?
[13:25:51] <cyth> or is there another method?
[13:26:18] <pifantastic> cyth: maybe you could create an ajax callback factory that returns a function that is wrapped in another function
[13:26:20] <cyth> because when I get logged out becuse of an expired session... all the rest complain about datatype and break the execution
[13:27:53] <cyth> pifantastic, not getting you.
[13:29:32] <cyth> seems like local will always run before global
[13:29:33] <cyth> hmm
[13:30:36] <pifantastic> cyth: http://jsfiddle.net/c2kWv/
[13:30:39] <cyth> might be stuck with cleaning up the code for a few hundred ajax calls after all
[13:30:40] <min|dvir|us> Given a jQuery element (e.g. $('#thing')), how do I 'unwrap' it, as if it came from getElementById?
[13:32:45] <cyth> pifantastic, yeah that still involves redoing a few hundred ajax calls
[13:32:50] <cyth> hmm
[13:33:32] <pifantastic> cyth: how about registering ajaxError
[13:33:47] <pifantastic> cyth: and making your session timeout work in a way that triggers an ajaxError
[13:34:01] <cyth> pierreee, yeah that's what I'm thinking
[13:34:37] <cyth> throw a 403 from the scripts in question
[13:34:58] <intellilogic> $([data-foo='Bar'])  case sensitive?
[13:35:42] <nickelnick> i know this is jquery and all, but does anyone know where i can get help for php? #php seems to be invite only now
[13:36:04] <intellilogic> ##php
[13:36:16] <nickelnick> oh nice! thanks
[13:36:27] <intellilogic> <3
[13:37:32] <intellilogic> Where can I find a list of mouse events?  IE:  Click, MouserOver, ..?
[13:38:01] <intellilogic> OH
[13:38:03] <intellilogic> NVM
[13:38:03] <intellilogic> lol

[13:38:09] <S|acker> =)
[13:38:22] <intellilogic> TY, I was here and I for some reason didn't see it right in front of my face
[13:38:31] <S|acker> haha .. I do that sometimes myself
[13:39:02] <intellilogic> Theres no right click?
[13:40:21] <ajpiano> intellilogic: "contextmenu"
[13:40:51] <S|acker> look at mousedown
[13:41:01] <S|acker> The mousedown event is sent when any mouse button is clicked. To act only on specific buttons, we can use the event object's which property. Not all browsers support this property (Internet Explorer uses button instead), but jQuery normalizes the property so that it is safe to use in any browser. The value of which will be 1 for the left button, 2 for the middle button, or 3 for the right
[13:41:01] <S|acker> button.
[13:41:56] <RealPlayer> hi
[13:43:15] <intellilogic> S|acker: TY :)
[13:43:20] <S|acker> no prob
[13:45:15] <Aric> I'm using the simplemodal plugin and i am trying to replace the contents of an already open modal, i tried just using .load() to replace the content from a url but it doesn't seem to work
[13:46:19] <PPaul> i'm trying to make a dynamic dialog... i give it some html, and it displays it, right now it only displays nothing :(  https://gist.github.com/1353174  pls help :)
[13:46:30] <Aric> I have a login modal, and then im trying to have a recover link, is there any tricks to doing this on a modal?
[13:47:22] <PPaul> my code looks like it's opening up 3 dialogs, though
[13:50:07] <ericandrewlewis> i'm attempting to add text after each anchor element of the specified class with this : $('a.describe-toggle-on').each(function( i, el) { el.after('<p>text</p>'); });
[13:50:53] <ericandrewlewis> but the parameters from the each function output as i=0 and el= the anchor's link
[13:51:02] <ericandrewlewis> oh
[13:51:16] <ericandrewlewis> haha!
[13:51:25] <ericandrewlewis> i forgot i have to wrap el into $(el)
[13:54:04] <Aric> Question :: This is my code http://pastie.org/2838545 - If I put the recover_link on the main page and click it (with the one line uncommented ofc) then it comes up good, but if the recover_link is in the login modal when that's up and i click it nothing happens, no action at all and nothing in console. HELP?
[13:58:06] <pifantastic> ?live @ Aric
[13:58:06] <bot-t> Aric, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[14:01:20] <Aric> pifantastic: ty, thought they were the same
[14:02:48] <Aric> but just reading http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4944293/jquery-liveclick-vs-click and better understand, ty
[14:05:41] <bakers> If I have an empty function: var foo = function() { };
[14:05:48] <bakers> will foo evaluate to true in an if statement?
[14:06:53] <ajpiano> ?eval !!(function(){})
[14:06:53] <bot-t> ajpiano: true
[14:06:59] <foo> bakers: yes
[14:07:00] <foo> :)
[14:08:27] <bakers> ajpiano: I thought so too... is something wrong with my call then?
[14:08:45] <bakers> ajpiano: If I pass that function an empty function for error_callback I still get the alert
[14:09:17] <ajpiano> i don't know what "that function" is and i don't know what "error_callback" is
[14:09:35] <bakers> ajpiano: Heh... forgot to paste: http://jsfiddle.net/aQUxL/
[14:09:39] <bakers> sorry 'bout that
[14:10:00] <bakers> I'm thinking something is wrong with my if (error_callback)
[14:11:54] <ajpiano> i can't experience its failure
[14:13:08] <bakers> ajpiano: Is that the correct way to test if a callback function was passed?
[14:13:12] <pifantastic> bakers: can you also paste how you are calling ajax_plugin_call() ?
[14:13:27] <pifantastic> bakers: it works, you could also use $.isFunction()
[14:15:02] <bakers> pifantastic: I updated it... http://jsfiddle.net/aQUxL/3/
[14:15:55] <cyth> pifantastic, btw the error thing works great. though a few of my developers used alert() in their local onError: but cleaning those up will be tons easier than fixing onCompletes
[14:15:55] <Ammaro> !list
[14:16:12] <cyth> >:| alert()
[14:17:08] <pifantastic> bakers: it's working for me
[14:17:17] <pifantastic> cyth: awesome
[14:18:10] <pifantastic> bakers: http://jsfiddle.net/s7LXx/1/
[14:18:12] <bakers> pifantastic: Oh!
[14:18:17] <pifantastic> I had to modify some things for it to run
[14:18:26] <bakers> pifantastic: I call that function three times
[14:18:34] <bakers> I bet the LAST one I don't pass it a function
[14:18:36] <bakers> sorry
[14:18:38] <bakers> that's my bad
[14:18:57] <bakers> Trying to shoehorn some OLD code into fancy new JQuery ajax and it's a pain
[14:19:06] <pifantastic> i bet it is :(
[14:20:07] <bakers> pifantastic: Yep that was it... sorry to waste your time
[14:22:06] <pifantastic> bakers: no worries
[14:24:10] <bakers> Hey ajpiano did you go to OSCON this year?
[14:24:43] <josefrichter_> guys, is there a way to use removeClass() to remove all but specified class, please?
[14:25:47] <jwm> jose, just attr('class', 'classname');
[14:25:54] <pifantastic> josefrichter_: $('foo').attr('class' ...
[14:25:57] <pifantastic> beat me to it
[14:26:46] <bakers> Hey can someone educate me on on() and off() in 1.7? Should I be using that for my click events?
[14:26:49] <josefrichter_> jam not sure I understand how you mean it
[14:26:57] <bakers> i.e. $("#foo").click( do_stuff() );
[14:27:03] <josefrichter_> jwm ^
[14:27:09] <Jayflux> bakers its instead of using .delegate() and .live()
[14:27:18] <bakers> josefrichter_: He's saying, don't remove all but one, just SET the class to the one attr you want
[14:27:45] <josefrichter_> bakers ah, i see
[14:27:49] <bakers> Jayflux: So it's not a new fancy way of doing click? The docs did have some click() examples so I wasn't sure
[14:28:01] <Jayflux> bakers afaik you can still do what you ddi in your example there, i only really use on or off when i want a live handler
[14:28:20] <Jayflux> bakers did you ever have to use .live() or .delegate() ?
[14:28:31] <bakers> josefrichter_: Alternately to be really verbose remove all of them, and just add back the one you want
[14:28:31] <josefrichter_> bakers jam pifantastic thanks
[14:28:34] <Jayflux> binding a handler to an element that hanst existed yet?
[14:28:41] <Jayflux> hasn't*
[14:28:49] <bakers> Jayflux: I've never really needed those
[14:29:03] <bakers> I take that back, I did live() once
[14:29:10] <Jayflux> bakers then right now it won't affect you. You can carry on as you were.
[14:29:19] * bakers carries on as he was
[14:29:42] <josefrichter_> fuck. still won't work. any ideas how to make the effect repeating, please? http://jsfiddle.net/josefrichter/RkLzT/
[14:29:56] <Jayflux> bakers but you should learn WHY delegate and live were used. So when you do come to need them you wil understand what you need (ie .on() or .off() ))
[14:30:16] <bakers> josefrichter_: like wiggle forever?
[14:30:31] <josefrichter_> bakers like shake on every click
[14:31:07] <bakers> josefrichter_: Gimme a sec
[14:31:50] <Eviltwin> jsFiddle isn't working for me right now
[14:31:54] <supsup> anyone notice jsfiddle so slow nowadays
[14:31:57] <supsup> yah so slow
[14:32:07] <Eviltwin> I mean...it is a free service
[14:35:12] <bakers> josefrichter_: What makes it shake? When you apply the shake class?
[14:35:35] <josefrichter_> bakers well on that link click
[14:36:57] <bakers> josefrichter_: Good question... I'm a little over my head with CSS animations.
[14:37:05] <bakers> Can someone else make sense of this test case?
[14:37:06] <bakers> http://jsfiddle.net/Qm4MX/1/
[14:37:31] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/RkLzT/1/
[14:37:36] <Eviltwin> josefrichter_: http://jsfiddle.net/RkLzT/1/
[14:37:48] <bakers> josefrichter_: You're doing a CSS transform on the element, can you do those more than once?
[14:38:12] <bakers> Eviltwin: Interesting... what does the setTimeout() do
[14:38:23] <bakers> Eviltwin: You're setting a timer for 0 ms?
[14:38:27] <Eviltwin> Causes a slight delay that lets the DOM do a little work
[14:38:30] <josefrichter_> Eviltwin huh, wtf?
[14:38:57] <bakers> Eviltwin: Doesn't work EVERY time...
[14:39:00] <bakers> but most times?
[14:39:07] <Eviltwin> setWHen doesn't it work?
[14:39:12] <josefrichter_> Eviltwin kinda ugly, isn't it?
[14:39:22] <Eviltwin> josefrichter_: Kinda works though
[14:39:35] <bakers> Eviltwin: If I click... it shakes and click it again after it stops it doesnt work
[14:39:39] <bakers> wait 1 second click again it does
[14:39:58] <Eviltwin> I consider functionality to be preferable to the prettiness of my code
[14:40:21] <josefrichter_> Eviltwin interesting. isn't there some removeClass callback?
[14:40:25] <Eviltwin> bakers: Try updating the delay to 1 or 10 MS
[14:40:26] <bakers> josefrichter_: Any reason you're not using jquery animation
[14:40:27] <Eviltwin> josefrichter_: What?
[14:40:28] <Eviltwin> NO
[14:41:06] <sarspazam> anyone know if there are any scripts to upload drag and drop upload images with jquery and asp.net
[14:41:15] <sarspazam> i've only managed to find ones using php :/
[14:41:17] <josefrichter_> bakers quote "CSS animations are pretty frickin' awesome - they use hardware acceleration natively, unlike JavaScript-powered animations. "
[14:41:46] <Eviltwin> Problem is they're not standard yet
[14:41:54] <josefrichter_> Eviltwin like calling addClass only once removeClass finishes it's work or something
[14:42:11] <Eviltwin> josefrichter_: That's kind of exactly what setTimeout does
[14:42:39] <josefrichter_> Eviltwin fuck standards. everything adopted by major browsers becomes de facto standard
[14:42:44] <Eviltwin> There's a webkitAnimationEnd event
[14:42:48] <Eviltwin> For WebKit-based browsers
[14:42:49] <PhonicUK> is there any way I can find out how many FPS jQuery is able to perform animations at on the target machine?
[14:42:59] <Eviltwin> When the animation ends
[14:43:41] <josefrichter_> Eviltwin ok, anyway thanks for the setTimeout. seems it works fine.
[14:45:13] <Tatsh> you can now use jquery 1.7 from google's CDN, but <script> tag only; not available by google jsapi yet
[14:47:53] <nbst> Does anyone in here manage the jQuery website?  I found a typo in the URL to the jQuery source.
[14:49:51] <supsup> bakers: http://jsfiddle.net/RkLzT/3/
[14:51:26] <bakers> supsup: not working in FF?
[14:51:37] <supsup> only tested in chrome ~~
[14:51:57] <WebDragon> what do you use nowadays to minify jquery?
[14:55:13] <bakers> josefrichter_: http://jsfiddle.net/wzj5d/1/
[14:56:02] <josefrichter_> bakers so what? :-)
[14:56:21] <bakers> josefrichter_: I think you'll be much better off using jquery animations
[14:57:02] <josefrichter_> bakers actually I won't. it's css3 age :-)
[14:58:31] <ajpiano> josefrichter_: have you seen stuff like this http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[14:58:54] <ajpiano> gives you the benefit of the css transitions, hw accel etc
[14:59:02] <ajpiano> but inside of jquery's animate api
[14:59:37] <supsup> joefrichter some people suggest cloning the original and removing old from dom:  http://css-tricks.com/9283-restart-css-animation/
[14:59:54] <bakers> ajpiano: Does this just wrap css animations around jquery animate() events?
[15:00:19] <ajpiano> i wouldn't say it "wraps it around"
[15:00:36] <bakers> does it convert animate() events into css animations?
[15:00:45] <josefrichter_> ajpiano so it's useful as fallback for shitty browsers or what?
[15:00:54] <ajpiano> bakers: yes
[15:01:03] <Tatsh> i use jquery animate enhanced
[15:01:14] <Tatsh> it's not perfect but it works pretty well; and if you only use pixels (like me)
[15:01:35] <Onyx47> just a quick one:  any suggestions for a scroll plugin or will any do?
[15:01:37] <josefrichter_> ajpiano ah, it converts query animation to css3, where available, right?
[15:02:02] <ajpiano> it's useful for giving you access to the perf boost of hw accel animations where avail
[15:02:09] <ajpiano> and falling back where it isn't
[15:02:16] <ajpiano> inside of the familiar animate api
[15:02:27] <josefrichter_> but fairly limited feature set
[15:02:31] <josefrichter_> look at this http://daneden.me/animate/
[15:02:52] <ajpiano> yes it is a limited feature set, it's an evolving space
[15:04:37] <josefrichter_> ajpiano I understand. It'l all prety fresh.
[15:12:18] <chovy> anyone know why <li data-isbn="00123" /> gives me "123" instead of "00123" when I use $("li").data('isbn'); ?
[15:13:22] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/data/ Every attempt is made to convert the string to a JavaScript value (this includes booleans, numbers, objects, arrays, and null) otherwise it is left as a string.
[15:13:24] <ajpiano> chovy:
[15:13:26] * ryanneufeld hit his 3.0 upgrade to day :)
[15:16:43] <ajpiano> chovy: use .attr("data-foo") if you want the un-coerced value
[15:19:06] <bakers> chovy: You could do data-isbn="_001234" and remove the _ after the fact
[15:22:54] <richardr> Using jQuery Mobile, each of my pages share a slightly different head. For example, the buttons on the navigation might change from page-to-page, but the navigation shares common layouts. The head buttons, title & possibly logo may change from page to page. One page might have a title that is a string, located in the middle of the header and a back button on the left. The next, might have no buttons and a logo image in the middle for the title. My question
[15:26:18] <chovy> bakers: ok.
[15:26:24] <chovy> i guess either way works.
[15:26:43] <chovy> bummer that it will remove leading 00's
[15:26:53] <chovy> is this a bug?
[15:27:26] <bakers> chovy: Not a bug... as designed per ajpianos explanation
[15:31:44] <gnat_x> can anyone recommend something better than jcarousel for the type of thing that it does?
[15:32:07] <gnat_x> i'm tired of fighting with its broken scroll implementation
[15:32:38] <chovy> gnat_x: write your own?
[15:32:58] <gnat_x> i would prefer not, but i may end up having to.
[15:33:49] <chovy> i try to avoid using plugins. after many years I decided most of the time the end of life is reached when a developer stops supporting them and they become obsolete w/ latest version of jQuery.
[15:34:49] <gnat_x> yeah, i'm going to need to try that.
[15:34:53] <gnat_x> i think/

[15:35:51] <chovy> someone needs to make a good jquery plugin that does swiping for tablets and mobile phones.
[15:35:55] <Jon47> gnat_x the thing I've found about slideshows is that you usually have to make so many overrides to the way it works, to make it match your specific designs, that you end up deciding to roll your own anyway
[15:36:04] <Jon47> chovy … iscroll?
[15:36:20] <chovy> Jon47: i think iscroll only went up/down, not left/rigth last I checked.
[15:36:33] <Jon47> i think it does left right also
[15:36:37] <Jon47> it's pretty rad
[15:37:20] <chovy> Jon47: that's not a jquery plugin, is it?
[15:37:25] <chovy> http://cubiq.org/iscroll
[15:37:49] <Jon47> nope, not jquery
[15:37:50] <Jon47> native js
[15:38:11] <chovy> http://cubiq.org/dropbox/iscroll4/examples/simple/
[15:38:16] <chovy> i don't see left/right
[15:39:37] <S|acker> chovy: lockDirection, when you start dragging on one axis the other is locked and you can keep dragging only in two directions (up/down or left/right). You may remove the direction locking by setting this parameter to false.
[15:39:40] <bradmaxs> I have a function to grab a value from a select box and need to assign that to a php variable.  $('#size').change(function() {var sizeVal = $('#size :selected').val();}); how would I assign that to a php variable after? Thanks!
[15:43:30] <kanzie> bradmaxs: all jQuery is done at client, all PHP is done at server. Only way to send data from one layer to the other is through a page-reload with FORM (GET or POST) or using AJAX through one of the many options of $.ajax()
[15:44:29] <chovy> bradmaxs: ajax
[15:44:32] <kanzie> bradmaxs: its a really open-ended question and considered web basics, hence not very many people care to answer. If you spend some time reading up first you will probably be able to make your question more precise and will get more help
[15:45:30] <chovy> $.post('/php-handler', { size: sizeVal }, function(d){ // do something with data returned });
[15:45:40] <bradmaxs> kanzie: thanks for answering.  I just need to place the #size value in a variable to be used when a submit button is clicked but the variable is php. essentially I want var sizeVal to be a php variable.  I'll keep trying.
[15:46:15] <chovy> bradmaxs: PHP is executed before it ever gets to the javascript. How would you envision doing this?
[15:46:28] <chovy> server side vs. client side.
[15:46:39] <kanzie> bradmaxs: the submit would "submit" to the PHP-layer and you would be able to get the value from $_GET['formname']
[15:46:58] <bradmaxs> kanzie: i'll try that thank you
[15:47:44] <kanzie> in your <FORM tag, whatever page you have as action, that would most likely be your php-page. In this page, add var_dump($_GET) and you'll see what values are sent to PHP
[15:48:23] <kanzie> then just do something like $size = $_GET['mySelec't]… Im not sure about the specifics but that is the gist of it
[15:48:37] <bradmaxs> kanzie:  I was actually trying to pass data to an element that I reuse.  I'll just have to include it to make it easier.  Thanks again.
[15:48:45] <kanzie> if it gives you nothing, try var_dump($_POST);
[15:48:52] <bradmaxs> ok
[15:49:11] <kanzie> bradmaxs: good luck… not so much a jQuery-question so you might want to check out #php or #javascript
[15:49:49] <bradmaxs> Yeah - thanks!:)

[16:24:13] <MTPrower> Good evening awesome fun peeps. I know little to nothing about jquery. I'm trying to install a media player that uses jquery onto a site that I think already has jquery. It's based on WordPress. Can someone help me figure out what I'm supposed to be doing?
[16:25:11] <MTPrower> "Take care to only include the jQuery library once in your page. If you are editting an existing complicated web page template, you might already have it!"
[16:25:21] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: open a console
[16:25:32] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: and type in $ and hit enter
[16:25:36] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: what's a console?
[16:25:45] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: you're hosed
[16:25:51] <ryanneufeld> ?console @MTPrower
[16:25:52] <bot-t> MTPrower, Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
[16:26:04] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: there is also a javascript console in chrome
[16:26:14] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I've gotten too far to give up on this. By the way, I have Firebug
[16:26:40] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: I know
[16:26:43] <ryanneufeld> I was teasing you
[16:26:44] <ryanneufeld> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/homgcnaoacgigpkkljjjekpignblkeae
[16:26:49] <ryanneufeld> that's a great extensions for chrome
[16:26:59] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: then open firebug and go to the console
[16:27:00] <ryanneufeld> :)
[16:27:20] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I tried chrome again recently. It disappointed me. Anywho, I have Firebug open.
[16:28:38] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: go to the console tab
[16:29:00] <ryanneufeld> you can run any JS you want in there
[16:29:04] <ryanneufeld> so to check for jquery
[16:29:19] <ryanneufeld> type 'jQuery' without the qoutes
[16:29:22] <ryanneufeld> and hit enter
[16:29:27] <imsky> Brodingo: how can you type on that chiclet stuff
[16:29:30] <ryanneufeld> if it comes back as undefined
[16:29:43] <ryanneufeld> then you don't have jQuery loaded
[16:30:24] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: Chrome disappointed me too when I first started using it
[16:30:28] <ryanneufeld> but as I used it more
[16:30:32] <Brodingo> s'ok
[16:30:34] <ryanneufeld> I love it even more
[16:30:47] <imsky> Brodingo: microsoft keyboard for you, stat
[16:30:48] <Brodingo> imsky i do prefer my older keyboard at home
[16:31:14] <ryanneufeld> you talking about the apple keyboards?
[16:31:28] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: funny. I thought I had jquery. It seems I don't. Anywho, if I give you a link to my site, can you tell me where <head> is so I can put the jQuery code in? Because I use PHP and there's a bunch of files. Dunno which one to put the jQuery code in.
[16:31:37] <imsky> ryanneufeld: yeah
[16:31:57] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: well, if you're using wordpress
[16:31:58] <imsky> Brodingo posted a workstation shot on the twitters and the keyboard just looks uncomfortable as hell
[16:32:03] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: then it would be in the header.php file
[16:32:12] <ryanneufeld> imsky: they aren't too bad
[16:32:20] <ryanneufeld> I prefer my comfort curve at home though
[16:32:21] <imsky> ryanneufeld: i've used them. they are
[16:32:26] <ryanneufeld> gonna get work to buy me one
[16:32:31] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I was hoping so. Thanks. I'll follow the plugin installation instructions until I break something now. xD
[16:32:32] <imsky> i just can't imagine devs using them
[16:32:58] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: http://digwp.com/2009/06/including-jquery-in-wordpress-the-right-way/
[16:33:14] <Brodingo> its not like im typing with a bear trap on my hand
[16:33:19] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: thanks a lot
[16:33:39] <ryanneufeld> Brodingo: just feels that way on the wrist at the end of the day :p
[16:35:35] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: np
[16:39:12] <coldhead> hey Iszak
[16:40:52] <KingDosser> Hi all
[16:41:00] <KingDosser> coldhead you around mate?
[16:41:20] <coldhead> somewhat
[16:41:31] <KingDosser> Got a quick problem, got a mo?
[16:41:53] <coldhead> put it to the room, and see what happens :)
[16:42:13] <KingDosser> http://pastie.org/private/00mfjqbnppq3gqru9agrzq - For some reason I get new_item is undefined
[16:42:25] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: are you there?
[16:42:38] <ryanneufeld> for about 5seconds
[16:43:01] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: never mind then, if you're busy
[16:43:16] <ryanneufeld> not that I'm busy
[16:43:26] <ryanneufeld> I'm about to logout and go home :P
[16:43:39] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: see ya then
[16:44:02] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: there is more than me here, just ask ;)
[16:45:02] <MTPrower> Alright. I'm trying to add a jquery media player to WordPress, and I've been given detailed instructions. Just not specific to WordPress, and not detailed enough. I would like some help figuring out where to place a line of code.
[16:45:56] <ryanneufeld> KingDosser: in your new_item your overwriting your function
[16:46:15] <ryanneufeld> KingDosser: and you're not using var to declare your variables in your functions
[16:46:23] <ryanneufeld> KingDosser: so you're making them all globals
[16:46:43] <coldhead> bless you ryry
[16:46:44] <ryanneufeld> KingDosser: look at line 41 of your paste
[16:46:58] <KingDosser> Err
[16:47:08] <ryanneufeld> yes it is an error, very good
[16:47:21] <KingDosser> Oh I see lol.. what a fail
[16:47:43] <ryanneufeld> KingDosser: yea, you should also use var for any function specific vars
[16:47:58] <KingDosser> Oh okay. So var is not global?
[16:48:01] <ryanneufeld> NO
[16:48:06] <ryanneufeld> not having var is ;)
[16:48:26] <ryanneufeld> KingDosser: like you did at the top of your script tag, do that in every function
[16:48:33] <KingDosser> Okay then cheers
[16:48:34] <ryanneufeld> also for your settimeout
[16:48:47] <ryanneufeld> you can just do setTimeout(new_item, 1);
[16:48:57] <ryanneufeld> which you realize is 1/1000th of a second right?
[16:49:15] <ryanneufeld> you might as well just call it :P
[16:49:57] <ryanneufeld> KingDosser: one thing you might want to adopt is camelCasedVariables and underscore_functions
[16:50:05] <ryanneufeld> and use var :p
[16:50:09] <ryanneufeld> I'm out
[16:50:38] <coldhead> but what about var nameOfFunction = function () {}!
[16:50:45] <coldhead> is that a var or a function!
[16:50:53] <coldhead> DAMN YOU RYANNEUFELD!
[16:51:51] <intellilogic> I once saw this website that was selling a jquery menu / tool, it was LIKE lava lamp, but way better, anyone have any idea what it might have been?  Trying to google, failing hard.
[16:51:53] <KingDosser> Thanks ryanneufeld
[16:54:47] <KingDosser> I've been meaning ot adopt camel casing just forgot.
[16:58:13] <imsky> nameOfFunction looks lopsided
[17:03:06] <Kent> Anyone know what this error means?
[17:03:07] <Kent> Uncaught TypeError: Object function ( selector, context ) {
[17:03:07] <Kent> 		// The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced'
[17:03:07] <Kent> 		return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context, rootjQuery );
[17:03:07] <Kent> 	} has no method 'tpl'
[17:06:54] <Kent> never mind
[17:07:31] <imsky> plz dont
[17:07:34] <imsky> paste
[17:29:10] <DrkShadow> I have a .live() listening for blur events. I need to not listen for blurs on _one_ DOM element... but I can't .die() on that element, can't .unbind() that element.. how can I make the .blur not trigger for that one element?
[17:32:17] <rawtaz> hello everyone. i have a possibly silly problem that i'd need some pointers to solve. i have described it well at: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/CtKGVMjxTh0Yh9dAtJ05/
[17:32:21] <rawtaz> (it's nothing complex)
[17:35:06] <DrkShadow> $('input:text').not('.datetime').not('.date').not('.time').live('blur', ...); <-- doesn't work. Please explain. (nothing ever happens on blur, regardless of the classes it has on it.
[17:42:01] <YammYgirlcoding> good evening all o/
[17:46:33] <warrenparsons> DrkShadow: FYI you can put multiple selectors in one .not()
[17:49:11] <DrkShadow> you can't use .live() with .not(), apparently.
[17:49:26] <DrkShadow> after doing so it selected nothing at all.
[17:49:56] <Eviltwin> DrkShadow: Don't use .live
[17:50:04] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate
[17:50:09] <DrkShadow> evil: what, don't use old code?..
[17:50:11] <Eviltwin> And :not(...)
[17:50:13] <warrenparsons> Or even better: .on()
[17:51:35] <warrenparsons> I am a little surprised that .live() won't work when chained with .not(), though.
[17:53:06] <Eviltwin> .live was always kind of a weird concept
[17:53:09] <intellilogic> I tried to go from .Live ->  .On and stuff doesn't work
[17:53:11] <Eviltwin> Not sure how it ever came to be
[17:53:20] <warrenparsons> intellilogic: Are you using 1.7?
[17:53:35] <intellilogic> Yes
[17:53:45] <patrick99e99> is there any performance difference between $('#blah input') and $('input') if assuming the only inputs on the page are within #blah ?
[17:53:48] <intellilogic> I tried today, downloade dotday
[17:53:52] <intellilogic> *today
[17:54:06] <Eviltwin> patrick99e99: The first will probably be slower if the only inputs are in #blah
[17:54:07] <warrenparsons> Did you write it as $(parent_element).on(event, child_element, function(){})?
[17:54:15] <patrick99e99> ok
[17:54:20] <intellilogic> It first the first time, then once the area is changed with ajax and new content is loaded, it doesn't work
[17:55:16] <warrenparsons> A simple rename of live to on won't work for delegation.
[17:55:21] <warrenparsons> The syntax is different.
[17:55:55] <Eviltwin> The .on syntax is much more like .delegate
[17:56:10] <warrenparsons> Yep. And I love the consistency.
[17:56:24] <intellilogic> what if I want my parent to be the entire page?
[17:56:34] <intellilogic> can I do like $("html")  ?
[17:56:40] <warrenparsons> Then you just do $('body').on('click', target_elm, function...
[17:56:43] <Eviltwin> And .delegate is much better than .live
[17:56:46] <warrenparsons> Or $(document).on...
[17:57:35] <warrenparsons> intellilogic: Probably, though that could be unpredictable, depending on whether a browser considers the HTML element an addressable part of the DOM.
[17:57:51] <warrenparsons> body and document are safe, though
[17:58:03] <Eviltwin> Well $("selector").live(...) is effectively $(document).delegate("selector",...);
[17:58:26] <intellilogic> document is good enough for me :)
[17:58:43] <warrenparsons> Most of the time delegating to the entire page isn't what you want, though. There's usually a more local ancestor you can use.
[17:59:52] <intellilogic> That worked
[17:59:57] <intellilogic> UGH
[18:00:02] <intellilogic> so many places to change it now, LOL
[18:00:48] <Eviltwin> .live never made a whole lot of sense to me
[18:01:00] <Eviltwin> I understand that they wanted to make the syntax very similar to .bind
[18:01:04] <warrenparsons> I don't even use the shortcut methods anymore (.click(), .submit(), etc.). Got into the habit of always using .bind(), and now .on() makes it even simpler.
[18:01:18] <Eviltwin> Well there's no strong reason not to use the shortcuts
[18:01:28] <Eviltwin> Except maybe for the asymmetry with unbinding them
[18:02:21] <cakehero> can I use ajax to post data as the body of a request?
[18:02:34] <warrenparsons> I know. But I like the built in flexibility of using the core methods, partly because if I need to add another event to something, I can just put it in the existing call, rather than refactoring to .bind() or .on() at that time.
[18:02:36] <cakehero> as opposed to sending the 'data' key which gets added to the URL?
[18:03:20] <intellilogic> Eviltwin:  Thanks again   + you motived me to get it done, LOL
[18:03:33] <Eviltwin> cakehero: You need to specify the POST method
[18:03:36] <Eviltwin> intellilogic: You're welcome
[18:03:48] <cakehero> Eviltwin I can try that, but, it's supposed to be a GET for this API =/
[18:03:51] <cakehero> ElasticSearch
[18:04:12] <Eviltwin> cakehero: GET requests don't have a body
[18:04:16] <Eviltwin> cakehero: They just have the URL
[18:04:18] <cakehero> http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/request-body.html
[18:04:26] <cakehero> Yeah.....
[18:04:29] <cakehero> I know that =)
[18:04:35] <cakehero> for this API they do (can/should)
[18:06:36] <Eviltwin> cakehero: You're probably going to need to change the method in the beforeSend
[18:06:38] <Eviltwin> If that's possible
[18:06:46] <Eviltwin> Or just use XMLHttpRequest
[18:07:14] <amh345> hrmm    $("#test_click").click(function () {alert('test clicked')});  doesnt work in IE7.   is this a known issue?
[18:07:15] <cakehero> oh that's a good idea
[18:07:22] <cakehero> Eviltwin that's a good idea, thanks
[18:07:45] <Eviltwin> amh345: What?
[18:07:58] <cakehero> Eviltwin turns out - the upside is it works with a POST, the downside is that you actually have to make the data a string (instead of an actual JSON object)
[18:07:59] <Eviltwin> I call bullshit on that
[18:08:08] <cakehero> i second the bullshit
[18:08:11] <cakehero> the bullshit calling
[18:08:31] <cakehero> amh345 try this
[18:08:32] <amh345> Eviltwin: in IE7.  .click doesnt appear to bind.
[18:08:37] <cakehero> $('body').click(function () {alert('test clicked')});
[18:08:41] <Eviltwin> amh345: Again, I call bullshit
[18:09:16] <Eviltwin> cakehero: 90% of requests are URL-encoded so $.ajax defaults to that encoding
[18:09:29] <Eviltwin> There's probably some flag to make it use JSON instead
[18:09:32] <Eviltwin> I'd check the docs
[18:09:33] <Eviltwin> ?.ajax
[18:09:33] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[18:10:03] <amh345> bullshit?  yeah. im trolling a .click issue
[18:10:14] <cakehero> Eviltwin yeah i've been reading that, except it would need to convert the json document to a string anyway
[18:10:20] <educr0w> Hello, I have a calendar, each day can have events (id_event, title, description, etc), in the calendar I only have "id_event, title", both values must be inside a <div></div>, the title is just plain text, how can I put the id to be able to bind a click event on the titles only??
[18:10:23] <cakehero> There's only one variable in the document so it's not bad
[18:11:03] <cakehero> Eviltwin I see Content-Type: application/json
[18:11:07] <cakehero> so I think it's using that encoding?
[18:11:39] <cakehero> or you think it's sending that but parsing it as form encoded....
[18:11:58] <Eviltwin> The server's almost certainly expecting JSON regardless of the Content-Type
[18:12:07] <cakehero> Eviltwin I can turn it off with precessData and then convert it in beforeSend myself
[18:12:20] <cakehero> *processData: false
[18:12:40] <fakingfantastic> anyone know how to can scroll a scrolling div back to the top?
[18:14:01] <coldhead> holy shit there's a company in my back
[18:15:49] <HardBoiledSoup> if you like techno you should watch this livestream http://www.justin.tv/epic_unicorn#/w/2043943904
[18:18:56] <richardr> With jQuery Mobile, when I do an AJAX request to get another page, the page appears but when I look at the requests the responses are empty -- even though it's working. Any idea why? Thanks!
[18:19:07] <educr0w> is this idea correct?? multiple html itmes like "<span rel="showevent" data="id_event">Title of the event</span>" and jquery code like: $('span[rel="showevent"]').live('click',function(event) { call to ajax to load an show the full event });}
[18:24:14] <educr0w> with alert($(this).attr('data')); works
[18:30:20] <warrenparsons> educr0w: I'm not sure what you're asking.
[18:31:05] <warrenparsons> You ask if the idea is correct... does it do what you want it to?
[18:31:51] <educr0w> Imagine a list of items..each item has various values (id, title, description, etc), the list must be the Title, then when I click on each title, I load the entire item to show it
[18:32:23] <educr0w> I don't want to use <a></a> tag,
[18:32:47] <warrenparsons> Are you asking if it's okay to put a click event on the span rather than using an a?
[18:33:21] <educr0w> yes..and used "data" to store the id of the object to be able to load the entire object when I click
[18:33:49] <warrenparsons> Sure. Though using .live() is becoming passe these days.
[18:34:28] <educr0w> I was reading, I'll download new jquery and use .on()
[18:34:30] <sarkis> hey guys what if i have an id like email[foo]
[18:34:37] <educr0w> thanks warrenparsons !!
[18:34:45] <warrenparsons> But yeah, using data is perfectly reasonable for that.
[18:34:46] <sarkis> with jquery selectors it thinks [ ] is special right? so its not selecting it
[18:35:01] <sarkis> how do you get around that? when an id or class has [ ] in it
[18:35:28] <WebDragon> I haz COFFEE again! woofuqinHOO!
[18:35:33] <warrenparsons> sarkis: By writing valid HTML, wherein [ and ] are not in your IDs or class names.
[18:35:59] <sarkis> warrenparsons: say you can't edit the html?
[18:36:12] <warrenparsons> Then you'll probably have to parse the strings before passing them through.
[18:36:15] <warrenparsons> Fun stuff.
[18:36:18] <WebDragon> then you send angry messages to the developers for doing stupid crap
[18:36:30] <WebDragon> invalid = invalid. period.
[18:36:50] <warrenparsons> Yeah, that too.
[18:36:59] <sarkis> nah
[18:37:10] <sarkis> apparently this works... \\[ \\]
[18:37:47] <sarkis> thanks though
[18:38:31] <Guest1449> warrenparsons, [ ] are valid for name's right?
[18:38:38] <Guest1449> warrenparsons, that's for form elements though
[18:38:51] <warrenparsons> Guest1449: I couldn't say off the top of my head. Maybe.
[18:39:06] <warrenparsons> Not something I'd use on purpose, though.
[18:39:10] <sodapop> what is the most preferable cross browser solution for file upload and progress monitoring?
[18:39:33] <Guest1449> warrenparsons, that's pretty usable as php gets those as an array
[18:40:14] <warrenparsons> Guest1449: Writing invalid frontend code to make writing backend code easier is the path to hell.
[18:40:24] <WebDragon> warrenparsons: hear, hear
[18:40:26] <Guest1449> warrenparsons, a name like foo[bar] becomes $foo['bar']
[18:40:40] <Guest1449> warrenparsons, I agree, that's why I asked
[18:40:57] <warrenparsons> Guest1449: It's an interesting question. I'd check the spec.
[18:42:23] <sarkis> Guest1449: this actually came from using a name as the id of a label
[18:42:42] <sarkis> name_error where name was email[2313]
[18:42:54] <sarkis> good to know that its not allowed in id's and classes though, ill go back and try and fix this
[18:43:35] <warrenparsons> Naming rules for classes/IDs are pretty simple. letters, numbers (can't start with one, though), hyphens and underscores.
[18:43:47] <kanja> Is there a shortcut function to submit a form ajaxly? Or do I need to create a dictionary for #.post by hand?
[18:45:04] <KingDosser> I am trying to create a jquery plugin. If I have a private function, how will i access the arguments sent when initializing the plugin?
[18:45:07] <d3v1an7> bit left field, but anyone had experience with running functions in a swf from jquery?
[18:45:48] <d3v1an7> i've read loads of documentation, but can't seem to crack this one.
[18:46:08] <last1> I'm trying to trigger a fancybox from within a .delegate event like so
[18:46:10] <last1> http://jsfiddle.net/4XRHu/
[18:46:17] <warrenparsons> d3v1an7: Does the function live in the SWF or in JS?
[18:46:24] <d3v1an7> swf
[18:46:34] <coldhead> woe betide you, d3v1an7
[18:46:44] <d3v1an7> its essentially a gotoandstop.
[18:46:50] <coldhead> KingDosser: have you read the official plugin tutorial?
[18:46:57] <last1> the fancybox shows up fine but for some reason the <select> boxes are empty
[18:47:00] <KingDosser> no coldhead.
[18:47:04] <last1> why would they not be populated ?
[18:47:25] <coldhead> KingDosser: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[18:47:34] <coldhead> not sure it's in there but it ought be :)
[18:47:40] <warrenparsons> d3v1an7: I've only gone the other way. You probably need to expose your AS function to JS somehow. Not my area of expertise.
[18:47:43] <KingDosser> cheers, coldhead. was not aware that there was docs on this.
[18:50:38] <d3v1an7> warrenparsons: makes sense. i'm using AS: ExternalInterface.addCallback("sendFunction",null,flashFunction); then JS: $('#flashObjID'). sendFunction();
[18:51:07] <d3v1an7> in various tests, it either can't find sendFunction, or it just fails silently.
[18:51:20] <warrenparsons> d3v1an7: You don't really have the space between your selector and method in real life, right?
[18:51:40] <d3v1an7> sorry, that was a bad copy/paste/edit :)
[18:51:46] <warrenparsons> Heh, you never know.
[18:51:48] <KingDosser> Unfortunately it doesn't look like it's there coldhead.
[18:52:33] <warrenparsons> d3v1an7: Yeah, sorry. My knowledge of working with Flash mostly consists of getting it loaded into a page and lots of cursing.
[18:53:23] <d3v1an7> warrenparsons: hahaha - well, if I get it sorted, I'll let you know :)
[18:54:54] <coldhead> KingDosser: then i would try asking ajpiano who is sure to know
[18:55:20] <neiz> can anyone explain to me the way in which jQuery.noConflict(); works.. I am able to use it correctly but would like a deeper understanding of it
[18:55:25] <coldhead> or gnarf or ben_alman_ or danheberden or one of those hella plugginy guys
[18:56:53] <educr0w> warrenparsons: do you know how to use .on() ? I can't make this works $('span[rel="showevent"]').live('click',function(event) {..}); with .on()
[18:57:47] <warrenparsons> educr0w: It's because the syntax is a little different. $(some ancestor element).on('click', target element, function(){...
[18:58:36] <warrenparsons> $('#span-container').on('click', 'span[rel="showevent"]', function(){...});
[18:59:06] <educr0w> thanks :D
[18:59:34] <warrenparsons> Sure thing. You can go all the way up to the body or document for your container, though it's usually better for performance reasons to choose a more local container element whenever possible.
[19:00:43] <educr0w> uhm..I have 4 span..when I click one I get 4 alerts
[19:01:04] <warrenparsons> educr0w: Can you put your code on jsfiddle?
[19:01:32] <educr0w> let me do it
[19:01:42] <KingDosser> Okay ajpiano you around or danheberden?
[19:06:58] <glaksmono> can you do something like $(iframe).ready() --> to make sure tha the content within the iframe are all loaded?
[19:07:59] <educr0w> warrenparsons: this is http://jsfiddle.net/8hwHE/5/ but doesn't works :S
[19:08:43] <warrenparsons> educr0w: holy crap that's a lot of code for jsfiddle LOL
[19:09:04] <educr0w> u.u
[19:10:33] <educr0w> the javascript doesn't work, the html looks fine
[19:10:36] <warrenparsons> educr0w: Trimming the HTML down a little to understand it a little better. Give me a few.
[19:12:13] <educr0w> and idea: <div row>   <div cell> <div cell> <div cell>.... </div row>, inside a cell is <span ..>Text</span>
[19:12:40] <abjorn> imsky mah boi
[19:12:50] <imsky> abjorn mah cracka
[19:12:57] <imsky> what's going on
[19:14:37] <educr0w> warrenparsons: I used $('div'), should be $('div.cell') or $(".cell") .on(..)
[19:14:44] <snover> educr0w: if you are outputting tabular data, use a table.
[19:14:45] <glaksmono> can you do something like $(iframe).ready() --> to make sure tha the content within the iframe are all loaded?
[19:14:53] <warrenparsons> educr0w: Got it. Thanks.
[19:17:09] <warrenparsons> educr0w: Try this - http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/8hwHE/8/
[19:17:24] <clu3> hello all, i'm trying to display an ajax "More comment" action. The server returns an array of comments , in JSON. I want to apply this json to a HTML template and render the list of comments, which plugin should i use/look for? Any reccommendation?
[19:18:10] <warrenparsons> educr0w: Actually this - http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/8hwHE/9/  - I removed your rel in the other version
[19:18:54] <educr0w> warrenparsons: nice!! thanks! :D
[19:19:00] <warrenparsons> educr0w: And you could delegate it up to the calendare element http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/8hwHE/11/
[19:19:31] <warrenparsons> educr0w: The problem was you were supplying a generic div as the container.
[19:19:41] <educr0w> snover: I'm using css with display table items, is like a table but div row instead tr
[19:19:53] <educr0w> warrenparsons: ohh ok, good to know that :)
[19:19:57] <snover> educr0w: for what kind of data? tabular data?
[19:20:15] <educr0w> yes
[19:20:19] <snover> THEN USE A TABLE.
[19:20:22] <warrenparsons> educr0w: If it is indeed going to be tabular data, a real table would make sense. I know it sounds like heresy, but they actually do have a real purpose.
[19:20:24] <snover> That is what they are for!
[19:20:39] <warrenparsons> And IE7 understands them :p
[19:20:45] <warrenparsons> Unlike display: table.
[19:21:04] <warrenparsons> Not that I want to give a damn about IE7...
[19:21:29] <educr0w> what is the difference between <table><tr> <td></td> </tr> </table> and <div table><div row> <div cell> </div> </div> ?
[19:21:38] <snover> one of them is semantic. the other one is not.
[19:21:44] <warrenparsons> educr0w: Semantic meaning and ease of use.
[19:21:45] <educr0w> missing one </div>
[19:22:10] <warrenparsons> educr0w: A table actually *means* "this is tabular data" and lets the user agent treat it appropriately.
[19:22:49] <educr0w> ohh ok, I'll replace the code
[19:23:11] <warrenparsons> educr0w: You can also gain some control over column styling by using <col> and <colgroup> elements.
[19:28:39] <Dr4g> my iframe has random content. trying to refresh it by going to itself again
[19:28:39] <Dr4g> $('#grid-leftnav-ad iframe').attr('src', $('#grid-leftnav-ad iframe').attr('src'));
[19:29:00] <Dr4g> This works if i trigger it manually in console, but when it gets executed from the function that gets called, it does nothing
[19:29:21] <abjorn> imsky: was taking a look at impactjs
[19:29:26] <abjorn> im so disappointed
[19:29:32] <abjorn> $100 per developer is like just
[19:29:33] <abjorn> I can't do taht
[19:29:36] <abjorn> I wanna use it but :(
[19:30:52] <imsky> impactjs?
[19:30:55] <imsky> that's old news bra
[19:31:15] <abjorn> I don't see anything better
[19:31:24] <abjorn> I know, it's not brand spanking new or anything
[19:31:57] <Dr4g> anyone ?
[19:32:04] <imsky> abjorn: https://gist.github.com/768272
[19:32:14] <imsky> i remember coming across proto in my search for one of these
[19:32:18] <imsky> good times
[19:32:20] <abjorn> lol
[19:32:28] <abjorn> cmon, github, you can load, i know you can
[19:32:38] <imsky> HTTPS FOR STATIC CONTENT?
[19:32:40] <imsky> YEEEAAAHHH
[19:32:49] <abjorn> makes sense amirite?
[19:32:56] <imsky> so secure. so srs
[19:32:56] <abjorn> yeah all that time was just resolving the url rofl
[19:33:29] <abjorn> anyways, ive taken a decent look at a good number of these
[19:33:40] <abjorn> crafty and impact are the only decent ones
[19:33:41] <imsky> impact wasn't my first choice the last time i looked
[19:33:45] <imsky> tried crafty
[19:33:52] <imsky> they're all kinda jank tbh
[19:33:55] <abjorn> crafty just recently got canvas support, and it's surprisingly sluggish
[19:33:59] <imsky> look into canvas animation libs instead
[19:34:07] <imsky> maybe you can marry a fsm/event system to them
[19:34:22] <abjorn> gamequery lol
[19:34:31] <abjorn> building a game engine on jQuery I think is silly
[19:34:40] <abjorn> browser games with the DOM is just a bad idea in general
[19:34:50] <abjorn> slow as shiiiittt
[19:35:12] <abjorn> ironically, last I checked, Crafty managed to make their canvas backend slower than the DOM based backend
[19:36:15] <imsky> this one actually wasn't too bad: http://cocos2d-javascript.org/
[19:36:26] <imsky> it's got a python parent, so most bugs have been ironed out
[19:36:30] <abjorn> well, gamesalad is actually really nice
[19:36:38] <imsky> check this out bro http://cocos2d-javascript.org/demo?demo=box2d
[19:36:44] <abjorn> i met those guys, their office is here, and the local nodejs meetups are at their office
[19:36:46] <abjorn> it's really well made
[19:36:46] <abjorn> but
[19:36:50] <abjorn> all their tools are mac ._.
[19:36:54] <imsky> lol
[19:36:55] <abjorn> so...
[19:36:59] <abjorn> I...can't do shit with it
[19:37:05] <imsky> "we thought ahead and excluded >85% of the devs out there"
[19:37:29] <abjorn> well, to be fair, their target audience is web developers so
[19:37:35] <abjorn> more like they excluded 20%
[19:37:38] <imsky> who says web developers use macs
[19:37:46] <abjorn> you and I don't
[19:37:49] <abjorn> :3
[19:37:49] <coldhead> ON A PRIVATE BEACH IN MICHIGAN
[19:37:54] <abjorn> a good portion do
[19:37:55] <abjorn> for some reason
[19:37:57] <abjorn> I don't know why
[19:37:58] <imsky> that's a recipe for butthurt. web devs use either linux or windows
[19:38:04] <imsky> wannabes use mac
[19:38:04] <abjorn> web devs like dropping wads of cash
[19:38:06] <abjorn> web devs make it rain
[19:38:31] <imsky> afaik no sites run on osx, despite apple's fantasy otherwise
[19:38:36] <imsky> so...develop on what you deploy to
[19:38:45] <coldhead> abjorn: http://i.imgur.com/48ACD.png
[19:39:04] <hobs> NO THIS IS PATRICK
[19:39:04] <bot-t> (393 hours ago) <coldhead> tell hobs we miss you
[19:39:10] <hobs> oh
[19:39:12] <hobs> thanks bott
[19:39:20] <hobs> also thanks coldhead
[19:39:22] <coldhead> those were the hours
[19:39:28] <coldhead> so long ago
[19:39:29] <hobs> the hours of your discontent
[19:39:31] <coldhead> we were so innocent then
[19:39:34] <warrenparsons> Screw the haters. Mac is where it's at.
[19:39:35] <abjorn> lol coldhead
[19:39:45] <clu3> what's the recommended jquery template plugin guys?
[19:39:47] <imsky> warrenparsons: for who?
[19:39:58] <abjorn> imsky: lol yes apple lives in a fantasy world
[19:40:13] <abjorn> a fantasy world where money is plentiful and steve jobs is a genius
[19:40:20] <abjorn> *was
[19:40:23] <imsky> well their money is plentiful
[19:40:26] <warrenparsons> imsky: For me. I enjoy my work-supplied MBPs very much.
[19:40:26] <abjorn> lol
[19:40:27] <abjorn> trudat
[19:40:41] <imsky> warrenparsons: do you write java or managed code to deploy?
[19:40:58] <warrenparsons> imsky: Sheeeeeit. I'm frontend, yo.
[19:41:01] <imsky> OH OK
[19:41:05] <imsky> the CONVO is about WEB DEVS
[19:41:19] <imsky> not about bros in thick-framed glasses and beards
[19:41:24] <abjorn> lol what
[19:41:24] <warrenparsons> imsky: Oh! Excuuuuse me!1
[19:41:25] <abjorn> this list
[19:41:27] <abjorn> has Unity 3D
[19:41:29] <abjorn> and says
[19:41:31] <abjorn> "JS Beckend"
[19:41:33] <abjorn> *Backend
[19:41:34] <imsky> yep
[19:41:35] <abjorn> uhm no
[19:41:36] <imsky> it does support js
[19:41:39] <abjorn> Unity uses a plugin
[19:41:46] <abjorn> and it has a JS-like scripting language you can use
[19:41:48] <imsky> no
[19:41:54] <imsky> it supports jscript
[19:42:08] <imsky> i forget if they publish to html5 yet
[19:42:11] <abjorn> hm, last I checked they had a scripting language that was not exactly javascript but mostly was
[19:42:13] <warrenparsons> imsky: And a couple of our top Java guys prefer Mac. Not that it matters.
[19:42:13] <abjorn> nah
[19:42:15] <abjorn> still just a plugin
[19:42:16] <b|indMoe> anyone have any idea why I would get a 'missing ] after element list' on this line: setTimeout($('div.mditem'+settings.classsfx).eq(newslide).fadeIn(settings.duration), settings.duration);
[19:42:17] <b|indMoe> ?
[19:42:24] <imsky> warrenparsons: ask them how they like the custom jvm that breaks all the goddamn time
[19:42:26] <abjorn> which, for games, a plugin isn't *that* bad of a thing
[19:42:38] <imsky> abjorn: unity is actually a pretty sweet package if you're willing to sacrifice tons of freedom
[19:43:16] <imsky> abjorn: http://unity3d.com/unity/features/scripting
[19:43:17] <abjorn> it is
[19:43:20] <abjorn> unity is nice
[19:43:33] <b|indMoe> anyone tried unity for phone games?
[19:43:34] <abjorn> imsky, you and I should make a canvas-based game engine
[19:43:35] <abjorn> just sayin
[19:43:42] <imsky> aren't you already making one
[19:43:45] <abjorn> no
[19:43:47] <imsky> yes
[19:43:48] <abjorn> proto is native
[19:43:53] <abjorn> not canvas
[19:43:59] <imsky> well how much longer are you going to stall on it
[19:44:04] <abjorn> foreverandever
[19:44:07] <b|indMoe> have you guys tried impactjs ?
[19:44:09] <abjorn> C++ is hard :(
[19:44:15] <imsky> not that much...
[19:44:16] <abjorn> we were just talking about that actually
[19:44:23] <abjorn> that's how this convo started
[19:44:26] <imsky> i picked it up for class pretty fast
[19:44:28] <abjorn> me wishing impactjs wasn't so pricy
[19:44:38] <b|indMoe> I would say the price is worth it
[19:44:40] <abjorn> imsky: it's not *hard* just a pain in the ass
[19:44:45] <imsky> tru dat ma brotha
[19:44:46] <abjorn> and not very productive
[19:44:49] <b|indMoe> specially if you spend the time to work with the box2d plugin
[19:44:56] <abjorn> coding in C++ is so slow >.>
[19:45:00] <imsky> b|indMoe: that's what the cocos2d thing was about
[19:45:03] <imsky> cocos is actually pretty good
[19:45:07] <imsky> abjorn: what ide do you use
[19:45:11] <b|indMoe> I haven't tried cocos
[19:45:13] <abjorn> you get caught up on constructs and dealing with the language more than doing actual logic
[19:45:18] <warrenparsons> Frickin' puppy goes 7-8 hours while we're at work without going outside. I come home, and he has to go out every hour....
[19:45:20] <abjorn> Visual Studio
[19:45:24] <imsky> abjorn: lolwat
[19:45:24] <abjorn> ultimatz
[19:45:30] <imsky> how dare you be a linux fanboy and use vs
[19:45:31] <abjorn> visual studio = best C++ ide
[19:45:33] <abjorn> just sayin
[19:45:35] <abjorn> BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST
[19:45:35] <imsky> MAY BE
[19:45:38] <imsky> BUT
[19:45:45] <abjorn> I know it's microsoft but JESUS CHRIST ITS SO MUCH BETTER THAN EVERYTHING ELSE
[19:45:47] <imsky> you gotta use dems open source tools
[19:45:48] <imsky> yes yes
[19:45:49] <abjorn> I WISH EVERYTHING WAS VISUAL STUDIO
[19:45:53] <abjorn> i really do
[19:45:58] <imsky> i don't actually like vs, reminds me of eclipse
[19:45:59] <abjorn> I wish every language had a visual studio
[19:46:08] <imsky> monodevelop then for u
[19:46:11] <b|indMoe> abjorn: agreed
[19:46:12] <imsky> or codeblocks or something
[19:46:22] <abjorn> codeblocks is gay
[19:46:25] <warrenparsons> abjorn: And maybe we could wrap every page in a form! Woo! Now that's livin!
[19:46:27] <abjorn> gayer than gay men
[19:46:30] <imsky> lol
[19:46:44] <abjorn> eclipse isn't much better
[19:46:47] <imsky> abjorn: i think you think C++ is tough titties because of VS, not in spite of it
[19:46:49] <imsky> use a simpler ide
[19:46:54] <abjorn> nah
[19:46:57] <imsky> ya
[19:46:58] <abjorn> VS has nothing to do with it
[19:47:01] <imsky> defo does
[19:47:01] <abjorn> VS never slows me down
[19:47:08] <abjorn> bro
[19:47:10] <abjorn> bro.
[19:47:12] <abjorn> no.
[19:47:16] <imsky> you hatin
[19:47:31] <imsky> anyway yes let's make a 2d canvas engine
[19:47:36] <imsky> i already have like 5 game ideas
[19:47:43] <abjorn> d00d
[19:47:44] <abjorn> me too
[19:47:45] <abjorn> like
[19:47:48] <abjorn> Zombie Puncher Deluxe
[19:47:52] <imsky> 0_o
[19:47:56] <abjorn> You punch zombies and they explode
[19:48:02] <imsky> lol
[19:48:06] <abjorn> AAA title right there
[19:48:10] <abjorn> $$$$$$$$$$$
[19:48:11] <imsky> AAAA*
[19:48:18] <abjorn> ^
[19:48:21] <hobs> I have an idea called space farm
[19:48:28] <abjorn> do you farm spaces
[19:48:30] <hobs> yep
[19:48:35] <hobs> you corral stars
[19:48:35] <abjorn> fucking awesome
[19:48:37] <hobs> and teach them to love
[19:48:59] <imsky> abjorn: why are you looking at game engines anyway
[19:49:26] <abjorn> cause im tired of making an engine for my game ideas
[19:49:34] <abjorn> ive been wanting to make this game for 4 years
[19:50:02] <imsky> hmm
[19:50:05] <abjorn> and the game engine id been making for it has gone under like
[19:50:07] <abjorn> 4 incarnations
[19:50:15] <imsky> sounds like....duke nukem forever
[19:50:40] <abjorn> C++ only, C-based NDS homebrew, C/Python, C++/Stackless Python, then finally C++/JavaScript.
[19:51:29] <imsky> that sounds
[19:51:31] <imsky> miserable
[19:51:36] <abjorn> it is
[19:51:44] <imsky> why didn't you use the fuckton of available C engines?
[19:51:57] <abjorn> plenty of reasons
[19:52:00] <abjorn> it boils down to this
[19:52:01] <imsky> name one
[19:52:03] <abjorn> the good ones aren't free
[19:52:06] <abjorn> the free ones aren't good
[19:52:07] <imsky> that's not true
[19:52:11] <imsky> ioquake is very good
[19:52:17] <abjorn> not universally, but I just never found one that suited me
[19:52:31] <imsky> man
[19:52:41] <abjorn> ioquake is a 3D engine, and I don't wanna deal with 3D
[19:52:56] <abjorn> my game aint 3d
[19:52:58] <imsky> you don't have to, point is there are many high-quality engines out there
[19:53:03] <imsky> fo free
[19:53:15] <abjorn> I know, I've looked, trust me. I mean, I'm just picky
[19:53:25] <imsky> sounds like a bunch of pointless delaying
[19:53:27] <abjorn> and I gotta find something that fits my sensibilities I guess, or I don't feel good working in it
[19:53:29] <abjorn> it is
[19:53:35] <abjorn> not gonna lie
[19:53:47] <imsky> why don't you just use haxe and output to flash as a prototype
[19:53:51] <abjorn> part of it is also not wanting to learn the ins and outs of a game engine
[19:54:21] <abjorn> lot of NIH going on
[19:55:34] <imsky> well
[19:55:52] <imsky> how much of the game do you have planned out
[19:56:00] <abjorn> most of the gameplay
[19:56:01] <b|indMoe> just curious but what were your complaints with impactjs ?
[19:56:07] <abjorn> just pricing, really
[19:56:12] <b|indMoe> ahh
[19:56:20] <b|indMoe> did you find a copy to at least play with to try it out?
[19:56:21] <abjorn> and largely the fact that I don't wanna commit $100 when I can't actually try it out first
[19:56:58] <b|indMoe> someone gave me a copy to play with... I bought it 3 days later
[19:57:00] <abjorn> I looked for some illegitimate copy I could use to try it out first, couldn't find one
[19:57:20] <imsky> // lib/impact/image.js
[19:57:25] <abjorn> lol that yeah
[19:57:31] <abjorn> doesn't have the tools
[19:57:37] <abjorn> like the level editor
[19:57:48] <b|indMoe> the level editor is fairly nice
[19:58:12] <abjorn> it doesn't help that the game I wanna make wouldn't be realistic to make on my own, and the license is per-developer
[19:58:29] <imsky> well bro, if $100 is the only thing standing between you and dev time, maybe you can invest it
[19:58:31] <abjorn> which I understand to some extent
[19:58:40] <abjorn> I really do wanna use it
[19:58:49] <abjorn> couldn't afford it right now anyways
[19:58:51] <educr0w> warrenparsons: in my pc, with the calendar generated by an ajax request I think the event doesn't attack because doesn't works
[19:58:51] <abjorn> looking to move out
[19:58:55] <imsky> you can't afford $100?
[19:59:01] <abjorn> MONEYS TIGHT
[19:59:03] <educr0w> attach*
[19:59:08] <imsky> you lie
[19:59:11] <thinkclay> Does anyone know how to reverse convert Google latLng? which looks like: new google.maps.LatLng(24.2342, 121.321214) // to just an array??
[19:59:13] <warrenparsons> educr0w: What container element are you using?
[19:59:23] <educr0w> div.cell like you told me
[19:59:35] <abjorn> im really not, imsky, im trying to move out into an apartment, i have so many things i need to buy first
[19:59:49] <imsky> i dunno bro. game engines are easy
[19:59:49] <warrenparsons> educr0w: Try it on body $('body').on('click', 'span[rel....
[19:59:55] <abjorn> i need to get my car checked out soon, breaks really need a tune up, they keep scaring me, thinking im gonna hit the person in front of me
[20:00:01] <imsky> if you need a custom one, making one is relatively straightforward
[20:00:09] <imsky> just look at all the bros who made their own
[20:00:11] <last1> when opening a fancybox and pass it the contents of a div, like so: $.fancybox($("#edituser").html());  the styling does not appear to be applied
[20:00:19] <abjorn> imsky: I know
[20:00:22] <abjorn> I def could
[20:00:30] <imsky> i dunno, there's no excuse for procrastinating on this
[20:00:35] <imsky> but i give you an example
[20:00:45] <imsky> when i was looking to do a proj in a game engine
[20:00:53] <imsky> i looked all over, and decided to use processing instead
[20:00:55] <educr0w> warrenparsons: works perfect
[20:01:04] <imsky> with 10 mins of work, my proj can be in canvas
[20:01:10] <imsky> because of processing.js
[20:01:14] <warrenparsons> educr0w: I figured. You need to attach it to an element that's in the page from the beginning. Try to find something lower-level than body if you can.
[20:01:31] <warrenparsons> educr0w: But body will work in a pinch.
[20:01:46] <abjorn> lol
[20:01:48] <abjorn> thats cool imsky
[20:02:05] <imsky> i mean i know the feeling of looking through all the choices
[20:02:08] <imsky> but you know what
[20:02:14] <imsky> john carmack didn't have aaaany of that shit
[20:02:22] <imsky> he just sat down and wrote a bsp engine and boom
[20:02:23] <warrenparsons> educr0w: The idea is that you're attaching your event handler to an element that's always in the page, and that your AJAX content gets loaded into.
[20:02:26] <abjorn> yep
[20:02:28] <abjorn> what he had was
[20:02:30] <abjorn> brilliance
[20:02:44] <imsky> right but that was for fake 3d
[20:02:45] <educr0w> warrenparsons: div#calendarContainer is from beginnig, is where the calendar is loaded by the ajax request
[20:02:46] <imsky> you just have 2d
[20:02:55] <warrenparsons> educr0w: And using that didn't work?
[20:03:07] <abjorn> imsky: I can do it well enough
[20:03:12] <abjorn> just takes time
[20:03:17] <abjorn> and my patience with C++ is paper thin
[20:03:19] <abjorn> but a js engine?
[20:03:20] <abjorn> yeah i can do that
[20:03:26] <imsky> so just do it all in canvas omg
[20:03:37] <abjorn> THATS WHAT IM SAYING
[20:03:37] <abjorn> GOD
[20:03:40] <educr0w> warrenparsons:  yes, is the lower level element that you suggested :)
[20:03:47] <imsky> why aren't you writing code lol
[20:03:47] <warrenparsons> educr0w: Ahh, good.
[20:04:14] <abjorn> imsky: well...shuttup....
[20:04:16] <abjorn> ILL START RIGHT NOW THEN
[20:04:18] * imsky shrugs
[20:04:24] <imsky> DO EET
[20:04:27] <imsky> how about this
[20:04:35] <imsky> i'll send you 5 bucks if you have a working prototype
[20:04:45] <warrenparsons> educr0w: Part of the reason for using a lower-level element is that the event doesn't have to travel all the way up to the body before the handler fires. With one event you'll probably never notice the difference. With many, it can have a performance impact.
[20:05:35] <abjorn> haha i dont need you to do that
[20:05:44] <imsky> don't really care
[20:05:52] <abjorn> you just wanna make it rain
[20:05:56] <imsky> i regularly donate to open source proj every year
[20:06:04] <abjorn> i always mean to
[20:06:05] <abjorn> then don't
[20:06:06] <coldhead> does anyone wanna listen to dev-o live with me?
[20:06:13] <coldhead> now is the time, spuds, now is the time
[20:06:21] <educr0w> warrenparsons: ohh ok, is very simple this calendar
[20:06:22] <abjorn> what is that, coldhead
[20:06:22] <imsky> NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT
[20:06:29] <abjorn> oh
[20:06:30] <abjorn> devo
[20:06:33] <abjorn> i
[20:06:34] <abjorn> im tired
[20:06:36] <abjorn> i derped
[20:06:37] <imsky> lol
[20:06:49] <coldhead> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEV-O_Live
[20:06:51] <coldhead> so 80s
[20:07:03] <warrenparsons> educr0w: Yeah. It would probably be fine to use body. But thinking about how it can hurt performance is a good habit to get into.
[20:07:46] <imsky> abjorn: bro i got an idea. start a kickstarter proj to fund your impactjs purchase
[20:07:58] <imsky> if that doesn't pan out, at least you'll be working on your own engine
[20:08:03] <b|indMoe> hehe
[20:08:16] <b|indMoe> $99 needed for game engine
[20:08:20] <b|indMoe> that should be easy to get :)
[20:08:22] <imsky> $1 needed for coffee
[20:08:27] <educr0w> warrenparsons: yeah, I'm new to jquery, every advice is good
[20:08:28] <b|indMoe> ahh true...
[20:08:33] <KingDosser> http://pastie.org/private/gnfndrlqvxdhhdbaioxmg For some reason, the window.resize isn't being detected unless I use an alert, which fires.
[20:08:57] <imsky> if your code depends on alert() you're proper fucked
[20:09:09] <abjorn> hahaha
[20:09:25] <KingDosser> Haha can you explain to me why that happens please?
[20:10:41] <abjorn> FUCK THE POLICE
[20:11:14] <b|indMoe> comin straight from the underground
[20:11:19] <imsky> NINETEEN
[20:11:21] <imsky> NINETY
[20:11:23] <imsky> EIGHT
[20:11:44] <imsky> a seething roaring shouting match
[20:12:02] <KingDosser> imsky ?
[20:12:06] <imsky> wut
[20:12:21] <KingDosser> whats up with the alerts?
[20:12:40] <imsky> oh my lord
[20:12:46] <imsky> i'm working right now bro
[20:12:59] <imsky> anyway
[20:13:02] <last1> what's the best modal plugin ?
[20:13:08] <KingDosser> ajpiano, could you please help me?
[20:13:19] <imsky> try $(document).resize instead
[20:14:43] <KingDosser> that doesnt work.
[20:14:49] <imsky> OF COURSE IT DOESN'T
[20:14:56] <last1> lol
[20:14:59] <coldhead> be more helpful, imsky
[20:15:18] <imsky> i shall be a helpful butterfly
[20:15:30] <coldhead> those are the 2nd best kind
[20:16:46] <KingDosser> okay then..
[20:17:05] <abjorn> coldhead: I'll bite...what's the first best
[20:17:58] <coldhead> the butterflies that you can eat and they're drugs
[20:18:06] <coldhead> oh i guess also the ones that eat corpses
[20:18:15] <imsky> never ask coldhead any questions
[20:18:36] <abjorn> lesson learned
[20:19:54] <KingDosser> coldhead, are you able to help me?
[20:20:29] <warrenparsons> KingDosser: Here - http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/BdRmy/1/
[20:20:51] <imsky> warrenparsons: his problem is with the cloud code, not with the handler
[20:20:58] <warrenparsons> imsky: Ahh.
[20:20:58] <thinkclay> Is there a way to ensure that ajax post data will be sent with proper types? Right now my ints are turning to strings
[20:21:07] <last1> when displaying data acquired through: $("#edituser").html(), does the .html() remove the css coding ?
[20:21:08] <coldhead> i can't help as well as these fine fellow sorry KingDosser
[20:21:10] <imsky> i think you have the wrong language thinkclay
[20:21:25] <coldhead> i am trying to remove some burning children from a fire
[20:21:29] <thinkclay> imsky: why's that?
[20:21:35] <imsky> thinkclay: we don't have ints in js
[20:21:45] <coldhead> or at least move them to a prettier fire
[20:21:58] <warrenparsons> coldhead: $('#fire').find('.children').remove();
[20:21:58] <thinkclay> Sorry, numeric or whatever type cast a float is in JS
[20:22:05] <KingDosser> imsky: what is wrong with my plugin cloud?
[20:22:16] <imsky> KingDosser: it's the reason you're getting your errors
[20:22:32] <b|indMoe> arg.. typed up a jsfiddle example of my problem then accidentally refreshed the page before saving... lame
[20:22:41] <thinkclay> right now I'm passing post data with a float (geo coords) to a php backend and the data is sent as a string
[20:22:42] <warrenparsons> b|indMoe: doh!
[20:23:00] <KingDosser> imsky: im not getting any errprs though.
[20:23:11] <imsky> KingDosser: yeah you are, your execution's jank
[20:23:28] <KingDosser> imsky: what do i need to fix?
[20:23:37] <imsky> how would i know, i can't see your cloud plugin
[20:23:45] <KingDosser> one sec.
[20:24:10] <KingDosser> imsky: http://pastie.org/private/ahssm1doeiykpphh0bjb6w
[20:24:40] <imsky> :( $.fn.cloud within $.fn.cloud
[20:25:05] <imsky> oh lawd
[20:25:13] <abjorn> ahhh
[20:25:15] <abjorn> pants are off now
[20:25:18] <warrenparsons> $(
[20:25:19] <imsky> lol
[20:25:33] <abjorn> I am instantly happier
[20:25:34] <warrenparsons> :(
[20:25:36] <warrenparsons> Ha!
[20:25:49] <KingDosser> imsky This is the first plugin I have made.. was asking for a bit of help with scope before but no one was around.
[20:25:58] <imsky> why would you make this into a plugin
[20:26:13] <imsky> what the hell would i use $.cloud() for
[20:26:24] <abjorn> $.wiggle(), now THERE'S a plugin
[20:26:28] <imsky> ^^^^
[20:26:30] <imsky> srsly
[20:26:37] <imsky> and in 130 bytes or so, too
[20:26:38] <coldhead> easy, tigers
[20:26:42] <coldhead> easssy
[20:26:50] <imsky> coldhead: you throw children into fires
[20:26:52] <KingDosser> imsky, it is a plugin that creates text clouds of floating words
[20:26:56] <Eviltwin> KingDosser: Read this doc: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[20:26:59] <KingDosser> that move from both sides of the screen.
[20:27:01] <imsky> you can't be a chill mod and psychopath at the same time
[20:27:02] <b|indMoe> ok rebuilt it :)
[20:27:03] <KingDosser> Eviltwin: I have read that.
[20:27:06] <b|indMoe> someone mind checking this out: http://jsfiddle.net/ezWnf/4/
[20:27:07] <abjorn> KingDosser: $.wiggle is better
[20:27:09] <Eviltwin> KingDosser: The whole thing
[20:27:17] <KingDosser> Eviltwin: Yes
[20:27:18] <imsky> KingDosser: so why does it have a .resize handler inside it?
[20:27:21] <abjorn> wiggle solves all your needs
[20:27:26] <b|indMoe> the setTimeout() line is giving me a 'missing ]' error yet there is no [ on any of the lines :)
[20:27:28] <Eviltwin> KingDosser: Then you would know how you should store data
[20:27:29] <imsky> wiggle solves needs you don't even have yet
[20:27:34] <abjorn> yeah
[20:27:36] <imsky> abjorn: gtfo irc until you have proof of concept
[20:28:01] <KingDosser> imsky: It needs to re adjust its widths when the size of the document changes
[20:28:12] <imsky> KingDosser: so it's a browser-wide word cloud?
[20:28:24] <KingDosser> Yes at this stage.
[20:28:24] <warrenparsons> b|indMoe: if statements without curly braces make baby jesus cry.
[20:28:36] <imsky> KingDosser: that defeats the purpose of a plugin. just write it as a general script
[20:28:48] <KingDosser> i am trying to make it so it will fit in any element
[20:28:55] <coldhead> imsky: not throw: lower gently
[20:29:02] <coldhead> respectfully
[20:29:03] <imsky> wow that's a problem nobody will ever have KingDosser
[20:29:14] <imsky> how about you never worry about resizing
[20:29:29] <imsky> coldhead: omg omg :[
[20:29:35] <KingDosser> the problem is... is that when you resize the browser from small to big, the words stop half way through the screen
[20:29:44] <imsky> who needs a browser-wide text cloud
[20:29:45] <imsky> i ask you
[20:29:52] <warrenparsons> b|indMoe: I think you need to wrap your setTimeout executable in an anonymous function.
[20:29:55] <imsky> and if they do need it, why have it as a plugin
[20:30:04] <KingDosser> i have a need for it in multiple different instances.
[20:30:07] <warrenparsons> Pretty sure you do, really.
[20:30:11] <imsky> name them KingDosser
[20:30:24] <b|indMoe> warrenparsons: I will try it out.. what is interesting is that the timeout works on my actual script
[20:30:31] <b|indMoe> I get the same error though so I will try
[20:30:52] <KingDosser> mostly to use it in many different contexts on the same page. Different word clouds for different halves of the page, plus on another page a full sized one.
[20:31:13] <imsky> KingDosser: take a screenshot of the word clouds you already have
[20:31:19] <imsky> let me see what you're trying to do
[20:31:35] <warrenparsons> b|indMoe: Just realized you have more than one settimeout. I'm referring to the one inside moveNext
[20:32:41] <b|indMoe> hehe yeah that is what I figured
[20:32:52] <warrenparsons> I'm out folks.
[20:32:54] <warrenparsons> Night.
[20:32:58] <imsky> later warrenparsons
[20:33:15] <KingDosser> imsky: http://i41.tinypic.com/2hzlljo.png
[20:35:12] <Spadeski> Is there any simple starter grpah plugins one where i can simple ad points to a graph grid ?
[20:35:36] <imsky> KingDosser: so something like this, then: http://www.lucaongaro.eu/demos/jqcloud/
[20:36:18] <KingDosser> imsky: Similar, except my one moves from both sides of screen to other.
[20:36:29] <imsky> what
[20:36:44] <KingDosser> imsky: my words move
[20:36:47] <imsky> they move?
[20:36:49] <imsky> how
[20:36:50] <KingDosser> some come from left, some from right
[20:37:00] <KingDosser> its in the code. .animate()
[20:37:20] <imsky> ok
[20:37:22] <coldhead> did you try flot, Spadeski?
[20:37:30] <imsky> so why exactly do you need resize, KingDosser
[20:37:32] <Spadeski> oh not yet checking itout
[20:37:32] <coldhead> that's pretty damn simple
[20:37:33] <KingDosser> there's a whole lot of math that calculates random things like speed, height (Top value)
[20:37:50] <Spadeski>  resize is usually standard on mozilla with textares
[20:38:03] <KingDosser> imsky: I need to check for a resize so that I can re-animate the words when you resize the window.
[20:38:37] <KingDosser> otherwise they stop moving in the center of the screen cause they were animated to go a distance which was the size of the old window
[20:39:08] <imsky> KingDosser: ok do you understand why $.fn.cloud.options = $.extend({}, defaults, options);  is wrong inside $.fn.cloud?
[20:39:30] <KingDosser> not entirely
[20:39:33] <KingDosser> sorry
[20:40:01] <coldhead> me either, KingDosser
[20:40:17] <imsky> coldhead is always there to comfort you
[20:40:22] <imsky> in your javascript travails
[20:40:28] <coldhead> it's cold comfort
[20:40:31] <imsky> cold..head
[20:42:03] <KingDosser> hahaha
[20:43:57] <KingDosser> imsky: well? lol
[20:44:04] <imsky> KingDosser: well what
[20:44:12] <KingDosser> is there a reason? lol
[20:44:28] <imsky> oh yeah there is
[20:44:41] <imsky> i'm willing to bet you have only one $.cloud() in your code
[20:44:44] <imsky> try putting in 3
[20:45:17] <abjorn> coldhead you just made me think of this LoL video
[20:45:17] <abjorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUPGxUA0loo
[20:45:26] <KingDosser> imsky: What do you mean? lol
[20:46:13] <imsky> KingDosser: i mean you're not writing a plugin
[20:46:15] <imsky> if($.fn.cloud.options.hoverOn){ $('h1').live('mouseenter',function() {
[20:46:29] <imsky> every single h1 in the document will now have a .live handler on it thanks to cloud()
[20:47:03] <imsky> since you're not paying me to fix this code and make it production-ready, i can't offer much more help than this
[20:48:06] <KingDosser> all I asked for, was how to fix the resizing problem
[20:48:22] <imsky> you'll be back here with more questions shortly thereafter
[20:48:54] <KingDosser> what is this IRC room for, if not to help people learn?
[20:49:16] <abjorn> well yeah but you can't expect us to make your stuff for you
[20:49:20] <KingDosser> im not.
[20:49:22] <imsky> dude
[20:49:28] <imsky> the reason your resize handler is bullshitting
[20:49:30] <KingDosser> i asked for help with one single issue
[20:49:33] <imsky> is because you don't know how javascript works
[20:49:38] <imsky> it's a thread that unravels the sweater
[20:49:43] <imsky> and 4 hours of my time is lost helping a noob
[20:49:54] <thinkclay> is there any way to ensure post data is sent as a float, rather than a string?
[20:50:00] <imsky> thinkclay: no
[20:50:15] <thinkclay> damn, okay
[20:51:08] <KingDosser> thanks a lot for all your help
[20:51:47] <imsky> abjorn: "plz sir my websights"
[20:52:22] <abjorn> sir pls
[20:52:31] <coldhead> HELLO THIS IS DOG
[20:52:43] <imsky> lol my buddy was like "omg there's this new meme, with the dog"

[20:58:49] <abjorn> 27 hours
[20:58:53] <imsky> e.which and some repainting code
[21:00:52] <coldhead> the web is so stupid and 80s
[21:01:04] <imsky> you said it coldhead
[21:02:37] <hobs> ive seen every meme
[21:02:41] <hobs> its not a good thing
[21:02:52] <hobs> you should pretend you havent seen all memes so your friends can think they are cool

[21:09:29] <karega|aniasis> how can I make a mousemove event bubble up
[21:10:02] <necromancer> is there a way i can select the @webkit-animation stuff here? https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/blob/master/source/bounce.css
[21:14:35] <last1> anyone working with fancybox ?
[23:16:25] <Lazzzy> Would anyone have any idea what I missing here? http://pastie.org/pastes/2840404
[23:22:10] <Lazzzy> We have a pretty active roomtonight eh!  :D
[23:23:32] <Eviltwin> Well I was going to help you...
[23:24:05] <Eviltwin> What's not working?
[23:24:14] <Lazzzy> :D  did I come aross rude?   I didn't mean to come across rude.
[23:25:05] <Lazzzy> Sorry,  I'm new to IRC and still learning edicate.  Its just hat most of the time I drop into one of these rooms its going crazy.
[23:25:15] <Lazzzy> The form will not submit
[23:25:34] <Eviltwin> Well you're calling e.preventDefault()
[23:25:39] <Eviltwin> That prevents the form from submitting
[23:25:51] <Eviltwin> That's kinda what preventDefault is all about
[23:26:07] <Lazzzy> If I don't call prevent default the form submits either way,  if I do it won't submit either way.
[23:26:30] <Eviltwin> That's because the dialog is asynchronous
[23:26:36] <Eviltwin> As is pretty much everything in JavaScript
[23:26:41] <Eviltwin> Event-driven
[23:26:57] <Lazzzy> right,  so how can I get the browser to wait for the click and then submit?
[23:27:11] <Lazzzy> Is there an easy way?
[23:27:46] <Eviltwin> You actually cannot do that
[23:27:50] <Eviltwin> But there is something you can do
[23:27:50] <Lazzzy> or should select the buttons click event,  the submit the form if its true?
[23:28:15] <Eviltwin> When the form submits normally, you should prevent it and open the dialog
[23:28:39] <Eviltwin> Then when the dialog buttons are clicked, trigger a submit but pass along some extra data
[23:28:45] <Eviltwin> Indicating whether to submit or not
[23:28:51] <Eviltwin> And have your listener pick up on that
[23:29:08] <Lazzzy> okay.  I see what you are saying.
[23:29:26] <Eviltwin> event.data
[23:29:34] <Eviltwin> Or e.data in this case
[23:29:44] <Eviltwin> Will match the second argument of .trigger
[23:29:56] <Eviltwin> So .trigger("submit",true)
[23:29:58] <Eviltwin> e.data will be true
[23:30:03] <Eviltwin> .trigger("submit",false)
[23:30:06] <Eviltwin> e.data will be false
[23:30:17] <Eviltwin> .trigger("submit"), e.data will be undefined or null or something like that
[23:30:31] <Eviltwin> Same with the normal form submit
[23:31:09] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[23:31:18] <Lazzzy> okay.  Cool.  so in my submit event I will check to see if e.data is true or not,  if its true I will not preventDefault and if its false I will?
[23:31:29] <Eviltwin> Yup
[23:31:42] <Eviltwin> Pretty much if(!e.data) e.preventDefault()
[23:32:01] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[23:32:06] <Eviltwin> You did use "event" instead of "ee"
[23:32:08] <Eviltwin> "e"*
[23:32:19] <Eviltwin> if(!event.data) event.preventDefault()
[23:32:25] <Lazzzy> then set the trigger based upon my dialog return.  Alright.  Eviltwin,  I hope that one do I will have the opportunity to help you with something!  Thank you very much.
[23:32:54] <Eviltwin> Doubt it but you're welcome :D
[23:33:17] <Eviltwin> I spend most of my time here helping, not being helped
[23:34:06] <Lazzzy> You should set up a website for donations.
[23:34:14] <Eviltwin> Heh, maybe I will
[23:34:33] <Lazzzy> Thanks again.
[23:34:52] <Eviltwin> No problem
[23:35:52] <amh345> im having a time inserting a var into a src for an image swap.    this.src = this.src.replace("my_over_btn"+ locale +".jpg","my_btn"+ locale +".jpg");  when i add in the var locale. i cant see the swap. am i inserting the locale var incorrectly?					
[23:36:22] <Eviltwin> Give a real example
[23:36:30] <Eviltwin> Of one thing you want to replace with one other thing
[23:36:33] <Eviltwin> Actual string
[23:36:35] <Eviltwin> No variables involved
[23:37:39] <amh345> well it functions without the variables.
[23:37:45] <Eviltwin> Lazzzy: I've launched http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[23:38:13] <Eviltwin> I'm just a million dollars short of my goal
[23:38:40] <clear-in> hi.. is there a way to not delcare all the variables i need to pass in data in ajax?.. example i will just call the form name then all the input fields inside will be pass in data in ajax post method..
[23:38:55] <sasori> hi, is it legal to assign a php statement stuff like e.g $_SESSION['log_in_name']; to a javascript variable inside a javascript file ?..like e.g var user = '$_SESSION["log_in_name"];
[23:38:59] <nVee> Hey. My app fades in a small tooltip when hovering over a image map. I however find that when moving over the image, it appears that the animation effects does not stop when moving quickly over a number of elements. I am using .stop(true, true) on both my fadeIn() and fadeOut() but no success. Am I doing something wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/mauritzswanepoel/NJCxr/
[23:39:05] <Eviltwin> clear-in: Perhaps look at $.post and $.serialize
[23:39:07] <Eviltwin> Holy shit
[23:39:10] <Eviltwin> Lots of problems all at once
[23:39:22] <nVee> sasori: you cannot have <?php ?> tags in your js file
[23:39:27] <nVee> it's a .js file
[23:39:39] <clear-in> lol.. eviltwin. ok tnx. i will look in serialize. i already lookd in .post
[23:39:41] <sasori> oh geezz.. :( ....ok
[23:40:06] <Eviltwin> sasori: You may want to try running it through json_encode and you'll need to do <? echo ... ?> or <?= ... ?>
[23:40:08] <FleetFox> sasori you can write it inline
[23:40:31] <Eviltwin> sasori: Remember that PHP will need to finish running before the JavaScript runs
[23:40:45] <Eviltwin> And that you're writing the script for it, not really "setting variables"
[23:41:21] <nVee> so .... :)
[23:41:40] <sasori> i had it like this  $('div.login-container').html('the div with some PHP related stuff) ...doesn't work at all, maybe because it's a pure js file
[23:41:41] <Eviltwin> nVee: You can have dynamically-generated JavaScript files
[23:41:42] <nVee> i have no idea why my fadeout sequences does nto stop
[23:41:53] <Eviltwin> But you need to make PHP process them
[23:42:10] <nVee> haha thats's sasori's question :P
[23:42:13] <Eviltwin> nVee: Could you make a working example?
[23:42:14] <nVee> mine is all jquery :P
[23:42:24] <Eviltwin> That's kind of the point of jsFiddle
[23:42:28] <nVee> hahahahaha
[23:42:42] <sasori> ok forget it..i'll just dig :))
[23:42:43] <nVee> well played
[23:42:48] <Eviltwin> nVee: You responded to sasori saying you can't have a dynamic JS file
[23:43:08] <nVee> Eviltwin: I never said he cant have a dynamic JS file
[23:43:17] <nVee> i said he cannot have PHP tags in a .js file
[23:43:26] <Eviltwin> nVee: What I mean is that I can't see the "My app fades in a small tooltip when hovering over a image map. I however find that when moving over the image, it appears that the animation effects does not stop when moving quickly over a number of elements."
[23:43:43] <Eviltwin> nVee: You can have PHP tags in a .js file, you just need to make sure your webserver processes them as PHP
[23:43:58] <nVee> bad practise?
[23:44:08] <nVee> bad spelling :P
[23:44:14] <Eviltwin> By working example, I mean something that shows your problem
[23:44:30] <nVee> I can give you a working example
[23:44:30] <Eviltwin> Right now all I see is code
[23:44:35] <clear-in> is this will work? $.ajax({type: "POST",  url: "test.php", data: $("#myform").serialize(), success: function()  {...} });
[23:44:45] <Eviltwin> What I'd like to see is something with a tooltip
[23:44:49] <Eviltwin> That doesn't work properly
[23:44:52] <nVee> clear-in: is it tested it yet?
[23:44:58] <clear-in> not yet
[23:45:05] <clear-in> just want to be sure if that will work
[23:45:13] <nVee> try it
[23:45:17] <clear-in> :)
[23:45:19] <clear-in> ok
[23:45:21] <nVee> why first come here and ask? :)
[23:45:28] <nVee> try it, if it fails then we trouble shoot :P
[23:45:44] <clear-in> im not familiar with the syntax
[23:45:46] <clear-in> tnx nvee
[23:45:48] <clear-in> :)
[23:45:54] <nVee> best way to learn is to try
[23:46:06] <nVee> that way you know a 2 ways of doing it. A right and wrong way :)
[23:46:06] <clear-in> be back soon. hehe
[23:46:21] <clear-in> lol
[23:46:34] <clear-in> i always learn the wrong way.
[23:46:43] <nVee> but atleast you learn that way
[23:47:10] <clear-in> lol
[23:58:23] <Vaidas> hello, is anyone have problems with jquery on opera?
[23:58:59] <Eviltwin> Please be more specific
