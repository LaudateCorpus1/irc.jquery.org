[00:09:22] <aaairc> Is there a way to tell when a $.getJSON within a $.when cannot load a resource?
[00:09:40] <hexacode> sammich theres no other way?
[00:10:51] <aaairc> I have this function:
[00:11:00] <hexacode> anyone know how i can make the browser redo css styles? im adding elements dynamically, but they arent getting the styles applied to them that they shud be getting. im thinking the browsers css engine isnt noticing new elements added or something?
[00:11:16] <sammich> hexacode: okay, so say you do it your way. How are you going to pick out the styles to apply from this css file?
[00:11:37] <sammich> hexacode: are you using widgets?
[00:12:45] <sammich> chances are you need to get the widget to init
[00:12:48] <sammich> or you're missing styles
[00:13:44] <aaairc> $.when(queryYoutube(searchTerm, 5, null, null, null, true), queryArtistsJson(), queryAlbumsJson(), queryTracksJson()).done(function(youtube_response, artists_response, albums_response, tracks_response){ .... } ---- the problem comes if one of the query functions can't load, then the whole thing fails... i want to catch if it can't load a resource, and then retry the whole query
[00:17:08] <hexacode> sammich the elements i add have a class that matches a style in the stylesheer
[00:19:01] <aaairc> so if a 500 (Internal Server Error) occurs, how can i catch that?
[00:24:56] <Springlab> Anyone in here ever use jQuery's load function to pull data from an external site?
[00:25:30] <Woet> Springlab: you will need a proxy script, you will get blocked by cross domain policy
[00:26:17] <Springlab> We normally use Chrome flags to bypass that policy, but I'd be interested in learning more about using a proxy script.
[00:26:39] <Springlab> My issue isn't with security however.
[00:27:27] <Springlab> The external site I'm pulling data from is built with PHP I believe, and the external site doesn't completely load before the data is returned to my site.
[00:27:59] <Springlab> So the data I receive is missing pieces that haven't had time to load on the external site.
[00:28:12] <Springlab> Is there anyway to correct that?
[00:28:21] <Woet> Springlab: usually you have like a small server-side script that does file_get_contents (if you use PHP)
[00:28:27] <Woet> and then you use ajax to get the content from that script
[00:28:48] <Springlab> Unfortunately the app I'm building can only use JS. No PHP.
[00:29:06] <sammich> Springlab: and if you just load that location in your browser, does it all come through?
[00:29:38] <Springlab> Sammich: It takes a minute for the div I'm try to grab to load.
[00:29:46] <Springlab> trying*
[00:30:04] <sammich> well that might be your problem
[00:30:07] <sammich> it's timing out
[00:30:25] <sammich> .load does a lot of stuff in the background
[00:30:33] <Springlab> Is there a way to trigger the load to only pull the data once the external site is fully loaded?
[00:30:48] <sammich> you might be better served with $.ajax
[00:31:03] <Springlab> As if right now, its pulling the site before everything is fully loaded.
[00:31:22] <sammich> like I said, it might be timing out
[00:31:29] <sammich> since you said it takes a minute for it to finish loading
[00:31:35] <Springlab> Yea I've considered that, but was worried I would run into the same issue with $.ajax
[00:31:52] <sammich> and why does it take a minute anyway?
[00:32:04] <Springlab> Not sure
[00:32:07] <sammich> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ see 'timeout'
[00:32:18] <Springlab> Maybe their site is running on a crappy stack?
[00:32:42] <Springlab> Here's their page.
[00:32:44] <Springlab> http://www.jaguars.com/gameday/schedule.html
[00:33:10] <Springlab> If you'll notice the schedule below takes a bit to completely load. At least on my end.
[00:33:29] <sammich> well, apart from the images, it pretty much loads instantly
[00:33:45] <sammich> and I'm in Australia
[00:34:15] <sammich> (ie, we're pretty much as far away from the US as you can get via networking
[00:35:22] <Springlab> Takes a few seconds here. I exaggerrated the "minute" statement earlier.
[00:36:30] <Springlab> But before the page loads the schedule, jQuery load is pulling the page data. So that section is blank in my response.
[00:58:57] <sammich> Springlab: okay, lets try another trick
[00:59:04] <sammich> turn off JS, reload that page of yours
[00:59:14] <sammich> see the schedule?
[01:00:11] <sammich> you don't. because that schedule is either ajax'd in, or built in JS and loaded
[01:00:22] <sammich> appended*
[01:00:50] <sammich> do you use the .load('url selector') format?
[01:01:59] <Springlab> yep
[01:02:25] <sammich> that selector means it will probably strip out all the script tags
[01:02:34] <sammich> meaning that your schedule isn't built
[01:02:43] <Springlab> ahh
[01:03:09] <Springlab> So should I use Ajax to grab everything and then maybe do a find()?
[01:03:39] <sammich> it depends on how that schedule is built
[01:05:17] <sammich> okay, so all the schedule data is stuck in $('#schedule-games')
[01:05:36] <sammich> you just need to load up the script tags, and hopefully, it might still work
[01:05:52] <sammich> maybe if you load into a hidden div
[01:05:59] <sammich> then do that .find()
[01:05:59] <Springlab> in the data I got with .ajax, it looks like the schedule is being built with handlebars
[01:20:13] <dwarder> can i use each inside each in handlebars?
[01:24:20] <menikmati> why doesnt this work? http://pastebin.com/g8aHCvmt
[01:25:29] <menikmati> and i get no errors
[01:27:16] <Cork> menikmati: is the ajax call succeeding?
[01:27:38] <menikmati> not sure nothing is appearing in console
[01:27:56] <menikmati> also have fiddler open and i see no logs
[01:30:18] <Cork> menikmati: try calling ajax directly
[01:30:24] <Cork> and attach done and fail
[01:30:28] <Cork> that might give you a clue
[01:32:30] <Cork> dwarder: not sure what the question is
[01:33:42] <dwarder> Cork: i want 2 dimetional array in my template, i guess i just can do this {{#each this}} 2 level{{#each this}}{{/each}}{{/each}}
[01:33:54] <dwarder> dimentioal*
[01:34:55] <dwarder> damn my writing
[01:35:35] <Cork> dwarder: ok, so "handlers" is referring to templating
[01:35:58] <menikmati> ok now i get error when i add.fail
[01:36:04] <menikmati> but not sure which one
[01:36:33] <menikmati> just says statusText: "error"
[01:36:35] <dwarder> Cork: handlebars template engine
[01:37:00] <Cork> menikmati: check the xhr object
[01:37:03] <dwarder> Cork: http://handlebarsjs.com/
[01:37:12] <dwarder> i thought it is popular
[01:37:18] <Cork> menikmati: if you don't have a status code it means the parsing fails
[01:37:44] <Cork> dwarder: ah, ya it was me misreading it as "handlers"
[01:37:56] <Cork> or rather a typo of handlers :)
[01:38:02] <Cork> (it's kinda early)
[01:39:28] <menikmati> this is what i see http://i.imgur.com/qGkdapT.png
[01:39:29] <dwarder> Cork: good morning :)
[01:39:42] * dwarder gives Cork a cup of coffee
[01:40:15] <Cork> menikmati: status: 0 means it's a parsing error
[01:40:30] <Cork> or possible a request block
[01:40:39] <Cork> menikmati: check the browsers error console
[01:41:41] <menikmati> nothing there
[01:42:12] <menikmati> the php file is giving back a valid json string and i have header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'); in there
[02:04:09] <Sleepingbrain> Im trying to make a ajax query page and it needs to return a object literal to use this https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete i know how to return json encoded data from a multi demensional array but how can i return a object literal? (Im new and this is the first time ive heard the term object literal)
[02:08:32] <Cork> Sleepingbrain: { key: "valie" }
[02:21:20] <chovy> what happens to script tags inside $('<div><script></script></div>'); ?
[02:21:34] <chovy> they don't recognize as nodes if you do $el.find('script');
[02:57:14] <notdan> Hi! Is there a JQuery UI widget for inputting a single character?
[03:36:46] <Danielss89> Hi
[03:36:58] <Danielss89> I have some html, and i want to find a class and change the parent
[03:37:03] <Danielss89> and then return all the html again
[03:37:04] <Danielss89> $(html).find(".product-layer-prize").parent().addClass("display-none");
[03:37:15] <Danielss89> but above only returns the found html
[03:37:35] <Danielss89> how do i say "return all the html"
[03:39:55] <Seich> Danielss89: You mean all of the html inside the html tags?
[03:41:48] <Danielss89> Seich: let me jut make a fiddle.. sec
[03:42:05] <Seich> Danielss89: Okay
[03:47:27] <Danielss89> Seich: I think this explains what i want to do: http://jsfiddle.net/ysjBd/
[03:47:45] <Danielss89> http://jsfiddle.net/ysjBd/1/
[03:49:20] <Cork> Danielss89: you keep parsing the html over and over again
[03:49:50] <Cork> Danielss89: use .clone() instead
[03:50:12] <Cork> Danielss89: also $(baseProductLayer).find(".product-layer-newprice").parent().removeClass("display-none"); won't change baseProductLAyer
[03:50:24] <Cork> it will parse the html, generate a dom fragment
[03:50:33] <Cork> do the search and modifications
[03:50:43] <Cork> and then as you don't store the fragment; throw is all away
[03:50:58] <Cork> and the next line starts with the original html again
[03:51:08] <Danielss89> ok
[03:51:19] <Danielss89> let me try
[03:51:57] <Danielss89> Cork: but find(). only returns what it finds right?
[03:52:04] <Danielss89> it doesnt return all the html
[03:52:05] <Cork> Danielss89: yes
[03:52:15] <Cork> Danielss89: it doens't return html at all
[03:52:22] <Cork> it return the matching dom elements
[03:52:26] <Cork> not the same thing
[03:52:35] <Danielss89> ok.
[03:52:44] <Cork> Danielss89: also why do you need to store a copy of the element?
[03:53:00] <Danielss89> because it changes with different data
[03:53:16] <Cork> so?
[03:53:22] <Cork> are you removing elements?
[03:53:50] <Danielss89> and i replace stuff {{DESCRIPTION}} with actual description as the designer havent given the code id's
[03:54:01] <Cork> ok, so you're doing templating?
[03:54:08] <Danielss89> yeah
[03:55:13] <Cork> Danielss89: http://jsfiddle.net/ysjBd/2/
[03:56:00] <Danielss89> awesome
[03:56:12] <Danielss89> thx!
[03:56:18] <Cork> Danielss89: alternatively http://jsfiddle.net/ysjBd/3/
[03:56:29] <Cork> depending if you want #product-overlay in the newLayer or not
[03:57:01] <Danielss89> guess i dont need that
[03:57:23] <Cork> the later won't include the outer element
[03:57:28] <Cork> while the first version will
[03:57:36] <Danielss89> THx alot
[03:57:41] <Cork> and that is why it needs replaceWith to not duplicate the id
[03:57:52] <Cork> np

[05:19:39] <DaniG2k> how can I make it so that there are at least 1 text areas and at most 5
[05:48:47] <beatnyk> How can I tell if there's any javascript/jquery conflicts going on with this page? http://uploadwire.com/download/305/LegitCodes.zip
[05:49:04] <beatnyk> I'm trying to debug someone elses code and it's proving to be a pain in the butt.
[05:51:32] <beatnyk> Sorry, the problem in a nutshell is this
[05:51:34] <beatnyk> How can I tell if there's any javascript/jquery conflicts going on with this page? http://uploadwire.com/download/305/LegitCodes.zip -- Something is causing the postback script not to work when a user completes an offer, the download doesn't start and I believe it's something to do with all of the javascript libraries being loaded.
[05:58:30] <jop008> I have this $("#title").html("test");  $("#title").trigger ("create"); in Chrome working fine other browsers won't update the screen
[05:58:57] <jop008> when I test if the value is changed the value is changed correctly
[05:59:51] <Cork> jop008: what do you expect create to do?
[06:00:07] <Cork> also what is #title?
[06:00:09] <jop008> hopefully update the screen
[06:00:16] <Cork> jqm?
[06:00:21] <jop008> <div id='title'>
[06:00:49] <Cork> jop008: there are no create event for normal dom
[06:00:53] <jop008> when I fill in old the string "old" stays the same
[06:01:10] <Cork> $("#title").html("test"); should work as long as you don't have multiple elements with the same id
[06:01:28] <jop008> but in Chrome it is fine?
[06:01:52] <Cork> console.log($('[id="title"]').length)
[06:02:07] <Cork> if its not exactly 1 you have a problem
[06:04:24] <jop008> any help on how to debug this?
[06:04:43] <Cork> jop008: run the test command i gave you...
[06:04:45] <jop008> double ids can not be true since chrome works fine
[06:05:12] <Cork> jop008: that command will tell you if it is or not
[06:05:24] <jop008> is or not?
[06:07:17] <jop008> The HTML document is fully valid. http://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html
[06:08:49] <jop008> when I change the field and test afterwards like this $("#title).html() I can see the title node is changed
[06:09:38] <jop008> but it is not reflected in the screen
[06:09:53] <Cork> jop008: either run the commands so you can answer the questions, or link to the page so someone else can check it
[06:11:31] <jop008> this is the page http://rental.touchingservices.nl/vw-book.htm?objectID=25002
[06:15:02] <Cork> jop008: if you want to change the title of the page use window.title not $('head title')
[06:15:09] <Cork> jop008: secondly there is no #title in the page
[06:15:17] <Cork> so $('#title').length == 0
[06:16:40] <jop008> it is not the window.title but a div element called title
[06:16:55] <jop008> is title confusing for the browser?
[06:17:04] <Cork> jop008: you are doing $('head title')
[06:17:07] <Cork> and no
[06:17:14] <Cork> there is no element with id="title"
[06:17:17] <Cork> none
[06:17:42] <jop008> There must be it is injected maybe timing issue
[06:17:50] <Cork> ...
[06:18:00] <Cork> ok what needs to be called to get the element added then?
[06:18:06] <Cork> cause it isn't in the page after a normal load
[06:19:03] <jop008> in librental the title is injected as top of #page
[06:19:22] <jop008> the title comes from the database
[06:19:37] <jop008> So based on db value the div must change
[06:21:10] <jop008> and in chrome it does change the title element
[06:24:02] <Cork> jop008: function querystring ( key ) can't work
[06:24:20] <Cork> jop008: it referes to it self and looks for a member key
[06:24:31] <Cork> querystring.keys == undefined
[06:24:39] <jop008> but I use it wo problems
[06:24:47] <Cork> so the code that addes the title doesn't run, and
[06:24:52] <jop008> querystring ("objectID") is fine
[06:24:56] <Cork> cause the title isn't added, you can't update it
[06:24:57] <Cork> no
[06:25:03] <Cork> it errors out
[06:25:38] <Cork> TypeError: querystring.keys is undefined    lib.js:835
[06:29:32] <JimmyXander> Does anyone know of a query plugin for converting markdown?
[06:30:22] <Cork> ?g jquery markdown
[06:30:22] <jop008> not on my console my console is clean no type error on 835
[06:30:30] <b-ot> Cork: formatting - JQuery/JS Markdown plugin? - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2604576/jquery-js-markdown-plugin
[06:31:04] <Cork> jop008: fine, the universe is ageist you and magically makes the code not work
[06:31:28] <jop008> I only say what I see
[06:31:43] <Cork> then you arn't looking
[06:32:33] <JimmyXander> Okay I'm definitely looking for something that can convert markdown in the browser in real time and display it on the page as I'm typing
[06:33:34] <Cork> JimmyXander: https://github.com/arhpreston/jquery-markdown ?
[06:34:39] <JimmyXander> That looks about right I'll try playing around with that
[06:34:41] <JimmyXander> thnx
[06:37:50] <ertl> Hello, I'm trying to set some attributes of an HTML form on the fly, using .select(function) ... this code http://pastebin.com/ta2JZqD5 runs flawless on FF, but it doesn't work on IE ... any hint? Thanks in advance
[06:40:00] <Cork> ertl: define "doesn't work"
[06:40:59] <ertl> Cork: when I submit the form IE doesn't go to url specified by action, but it remains on the current page
[06:41:23] <ertl> Cork: so I suppose the script isn't working and the correct action url is not set
[06:41:33] <Cork> ertl: does the select even trigger at all in ie?
[06:41:56] <Cork> is the variables correct when you get down to line 8+ ?
[06:42:18] <ertl> Cork: cough cough *shame* ... how can I debug it?
[06:42:27] <Cork> ertl: console.log()
[06:42:28] <JimmyXander> Cork: Do you think there's any way to remove functionality? For example, if I wanted to strip all HTML from the original text field so that no one could submit malicious code, would that be possible?
[06:42:40] <Cork> open the developer window and look at what values you get logged
[06:42:52] <Cork> ertl: also use event listeners instead of onsubmit event attributes
[06:43:54] <Cork> JimmyXander: that should happen server side
[06:44:04] <Cork> JimmyXander: you should never do security code client cide
[06:44:08] <Cork> *side
[06:44:20] <ertl> Cork: I'll check with console.log(), thanks ... do you think I'm doing some wrong (the code is pretty simple, I think) or I can start to blame IE?
[06:44:30] <JimmyXander> fair enough
[06:44:50] <Cork> ertl: well 7 isn't exactly modern, so i would suggest changins that one
[06:45:12] <Cork> ertl: other then that the only think i'm not sure about is the select event
[06:45:37] <ertl> Cork: it's IE 10 actually
[06:45:40] <Cork> ertl: well as long as you use domready in your code
[06:45:57] <Cork> $(function() { /* the code you pasted */ });
[06:46:40] <Tingle> what do you guys think, on('click'... or click(), I know click is just a shorthand for on('click'... but I was reading about using on() directly will attack the event listener to the immediate parent node, and thus reduce the bubbling phase - is this true?
[06:47:07] <Cork> ertl: what i don't really understand, why should the user selecting in a field trigger that you can submit a form?
[06:47:14] <Tingle> attach*
[06:47:31] <Cork> i can't really see how there could be a connection there...
[06:47:49] <ertl> Cork: no, wait, there's a "select" field, than, according to that, other values are changed, like url action, target and so on
[06:48:04] <Cork> Tingle: if you use plain on('click') it won't gain you anything
[06:48:19] <Cork> Tingle: it is the delegate syntax for on that can be performance wins
[06:48:37] <Cork> ertl: that isn't a select event
[06:48:47] <Cork> ertl: select is triggered when user makes a selection
[06:48:53] <Tingle> and what would this delegate syntax be that would improve the performance?
[06:48:57] <Cork> like marking a section of text in a textarea
[06:49:16] <Cork> ertl: if you want change a selection in a select element
[06:49:26] <Cork> ertl: you want .change
[06:49:53] <ertl> Cork: oops! Thanks for the hint ... but now I wonder why it was working on FF, lol
[06:49:54] <Cork> ?api delegate
[06:49:54] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:50:17] <Cork> Tingle: read that page, and after that check the on page
[06:50:26] <Tingle> ok thx
[06:50:33] <Cork> Tingle: there is a special syntax for on that allows you to do the same thing as .delegate
[06:50:55] <Cork> ?api on
[06:50:55] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:51:46] <jop008> strange things happening   $("#reserve").click(function (e) {   debugger; doesn't bring the debugger
[06:51:49] <ertl> Cork: great! it works both on IE and FF ... many, many thanks
[06:51:58] <Cork> ertl: yw
[06:52:05] <jop008> in Chrome ithe debugger is there
[06:52:17] <jop008> but in FF and Safari not
[06:52:36] <jop008> I can't see error messages on the console
[06:53:09] <drecute> Hi
[06:53:44] <drecute> I'll like to know how to invoke 'gigya.socialize.getContacts({callback: getContacts_callback });' using jquery deferred
[07:04:37] <Tingle> Cork, I'm abit confused about these delegated events approach, here in the example, it says that we have 1000 tr rows in 'tbody', which means when doing $("#dataTable tbody tr").on("click" we are attaching that event to 1000 elements... but where is the differnce to doing $("#dataTable tbody").on("click", "tr", ... ? doesnt that still attach it to every tr inside tbody...?
[07:38:37] <Tingle> Cork?
[07:40:23] <grafi> it does attach to tbody Tingle
[07:40:30] <grafi> then when you click on a tr
[07:40:36] <grafi> the event bubbles up as normal
[07:40:48] <grafi> an the tbody sees it, sees that it comes from a tr
[07:40:57] <grafi> and executes the handler
[07:41:17] <Tingle> I thought that events bubble up the tree, not down
[07:41:28] <Tingle> how would it even know about tr
[07:41:31] <grafi> tbody should be up the tree no?
[07:41:47] <Tingle> tbody holds tr's?
[07:41:52] <Tingle> so they are a child of tbody
[07:42:00] <grafi> not?
[07:42:04] <Tingle> yea
[07:42:14] <grafi> so whats the problem
[07:42:15] <grafi> :P
[07:42:24] <Tingle> so if the event is bound to tbody, how would tr be a trigger
[07:43:04] <Tingle> or how would it know which one considering there are 1000 tr elements
[07:43:17] <Tingle> I think im not understanding this properly :/
[07:43:24] <grafi> because thats information that bubbles up too
[07:43:34] <grafi> just console.log and event
[07:43:41] <grafi> and look at the info thats in there
[07:45:54] <Tingle> mm the way I understand this, is that every click you do, is a triggered event which happens no matter if you bound something to it or not correct? the event starts at the bottom most element and bubbles its way up the tree to the root document. then if on the way, a handler has been set, it triggeres that handler - correct?  thats event bubbleing as I understand it?
[07:46:41] <grafi> sounds about right
[07:46:59] <Tingle> so trying to understand direct and delegated events now
[07:47:11] <Tingle> delegated events seem to "stop" the bubbling
[07:47:29] <Tingle> or wait
[07:47:35] <Tingle> no I dont get it
[07:47:55] <Tingle> is realy a event triggered every time for that branch of elements when you click it?
[07:48:05] <Tingle> or only if you bind a event somewhere in that branch?
[07:49:09] <Tingle> im looking at this: http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing
[07:51:07] <grafi> http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter13.html maybe read through this
[07:51:16] <Tingle> so jquery uses bubbling instead of capturing
[07:51:36] <Tingle> thats alot to read >.>
[07:53:04] <grafi> well
[07:53:15] <grafi> its good though i think :P
[07:56:51] <Tingle> mm Ill hang on to that book
[07:57:27] <Tingle> seems like a good read to get a thorough grasp of jscript
[08:01:36] <El_Caballero> Hello Team. I am using the jquery autocomplete ( not the jqueryui ), and now I would like to add a minlength to the app. I think that migrate is pretty hard work... so... is there any way to add that minlength?
[08:01:48] <Tingle> mmm this is actualy easy to read grafi - I always dodge long reads because they authors writing style is hard to see clearly through
[08:11:56] <Cork> El_Caballero: migrating to jquery ui should be fairly simple in most cases
[08:12:15] <Cork> El_Caballero: adding minlength might actually be quite hard depending on the library
[08:12:30] <Cork> El_Caballero: cause if it's written the wrong way you don't have a way to do it
[08:12:48] <Cork> it might also be a simple if case
[08:12:55] <jop008> I try to make a fiddle with this code http://pastebin.com/pAd5vAfu when I try to do it says updating but nothing is happening
[08:13:22] <El_Caballero> Cork: hmmm... ok. First I will try to migrate to the new jqueryui autocomplete.
[08:14:03] <Cork> El_Caballero: i didn't use the jquery ui until quite reasonably (i start using it before it existed in ui)
[08:14:33] <Cork> but moving to ui was only about adding a few extension functions to ui autocomplete to give the full functionality from the old plugin
[08:14:51] <Cork> ui autocomplete is VERY extendable, so it is quite easy to make it do what you want
[08:15:21] <Tingle> is there a short explanation to what jqueryUI is?
[08:15:34] <Cork> ?g jquery ui demo
[08:15:35] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery UI Demos | jQuery UI → http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[08:15:50] <Tingle> thx
[08:16:00] <El_Caballero> Tingle: Jquery is a java script that create nice beauty widgets. See the example given by Cork.
[08:16:17] <Tingle> I know what jquery is, I use it - was just wondeirng what jqueryUIis
[08:16:44] <El_Caballero> Tingle: Jquery is the old one. Jqueryui is the newone.
[08:16:52] <Velveeta> jquery ui is a collection of reusable widget components, plus a factory method for creating your own
[08:16:54] <Cork> uhhh-... no
[08:17:04] <Velveeta> i did a presentation on this just recently
[08:17:10] <Cork> El_Caballero: jquery is the base dom manipulation library
[08:17:16] <Velveeta> jquery ui is built on top of jquery, it's not an old vs new thing
[08:17:24] <Cork> El_Caballero: jquery ui builds on jquery and adds ui parts
[08:17:25] <El_Caballero> ohhhh
[08:17:59] <Velveeta> and jquery mobile is built on top of jquery ui
[08:18:46] <Velveeta> also, tingle, you were asking about event bubbling and whatnot, did you satisfy yourself with answers to that yet?
[08:18:54] <Tingle> yep
[08:19:04] <Tingle> I think I understand browser events pretty good now
[08:19:05] <Velveeta> i just woke up half an hour ago and spent that time bs'ing and then reading the back scroll here :D
[08:19:10] <Velveeta> ok good
[08:19:15] <El_Caballero> wow.. I also say thanks. Now I am much clear about Jquery!
[08:19:52] <El_Caballero> Cork: about autocomplete, I will try to migrate to the new one. Thanks for the advice
[08:20:09] <Tingle> but havent understood dorect and delegated events yet - I understand how events flow and are controlled in normal jscript thanks to this ebook I just read, but havent re-read the direct and delegated events section on the jquery .on() function yet. checking out jquery ui
[08:20:35] <Tingle> so jqueryui basicly creats clicknfeel elements using 'elements'... I guess thats ok for the past and past-present but with canvas drawing and webgl - I think jqueryUI will become obsolete
[08:20:35] <Velveeta> so, as far as direct vs delegated events, it's mostly about scalability
[08:21:00] <Cork> Tingle: delegation is based about you binding the event listener on a parent that holds the the tree where the target your after exists
[08:21:04] <Velveeta> tingle: canvases are nothing more than pixel maps, you can't interact with them via events that involve the elements they draw
[08:21:34] <Velveeta> so there will still very much be a need for actual ui components that are not canvases..
[08:21:50] <Tingle> mm thats true i guess, was thinking to game-ish
[08:22:00] <Cork> though much of what ui does is comming to native html/css
[08:22:25] <Cork> though canvas and webgl is something completely different
[08:22:26] <Velveeta> for games that may be true, canvases work fine for those use cases, but for anything interactive like drop down components, or autocomplete widgets, or things like that, you need actual dom elements to interact with
[08:22:49] <Cork> Velveeta: what i meant is html form has standards for autocomplete without js
[08:22:57] <Cork> same for sliders and much other things
[08:23:23] <Velveeta> right, those things are coming slowly, but there are always going to be interactive components that people think up that have no native implementation
[08:23:35] <Cork> definitely
[08:23:52] <Velveeta> in addition, widgets can be used for custom workflow direction, or styling and adding behavior to things like data grids
[08:24:12] <Cork> grids is comming to native html :)
[08:24:26] <Velveeta> so, to jump back to direct vs delegated events real quick, one of the easiest ways to explain the benefits of a delegated listener is to imagine a tic tac toe grid
[08:24:38] <Velveeta> 3x3 right? you can bind to 9 cells no problem and act on click
[08:24:54] <Velveeta> now let's say you want to scale that behavior up to say, 100x100 rows and columns
[08:25:02] <Velveeta> now you're talking about binding listeners to 10000 elements on the page
[08:25:21] <Velveeta> and if you've ever actually tried doing that, it will typically bring a browser to its knees
[08:25:44] <Velveeta> but if you bind 1 listener at the table/div container level, and let the event bubble up to there, you have 1 listener doing the work of 10000
[08:27:59] <Velveeta> cork: and grids may be coming to native html, but not like the ones we use in my company, that have built-in support for pagination and column sorting and a filtering text box :D so that's where jquery ui can still fill a gap in functionality
[08:28:37] <Cork> Velveeta: well pagination is basically just about hiding section/replacing sections in the grid
[08:28:40] <Tingle> I was wondering, why hasn't jquery added css animations as a default behavior behind the animate() function and default to jquery animate if the browser doesnt support it. animations are so much more smoother and css > jscript performance wise... I have this jquery library that does that, but I wonder why they havent added this to the default library
[08:29:21] <Cork> Tingle: the animate function was written WAY before css animation existed
[08:29:37] <Cork> Tingle: and many of the animations you normally do with animate() can't be done with css
[08:29:40] <Velveeta> cork: well in our grids, we ajax load a page at a time from the server, which is auto-filtered by any existing value in the text box, and i've also added support to our grids to take a client-side data set to draw from, so they can either ajax-request their data, or render it entirely locally
[08:29:43] <Cork> like slideToggle
[08:30:03] <Tingle> yeah I know, but im just saying - things that are possible, could use css and then default to the normaly jquery stuff
[08:30:13] <Tingle> normal*
[08:30:13] <Cork> Velveeta: that is all backend, what html gives you is the interface
[08:30:36] <Tingle> and if jquery is activly developed and maintained... I dont see why they cant add that. better performance for things that do work with css
[08:30:45] <Velveeta> cork: right, but the front end interface decides how to request that data, either from another front end component, or from the back end, so that's business logic that's tied to the component itself
[08:30:47] <Tingle> then we wouldnt have to use external libs
[08:30:49] <Cork> Tingle: if you want to animate ex. hide/show + something that can use css would endup out of sync
[08:31:07] <Cork> Tingle: and if you use css animation you don't need to do anything in js
[08:31:25] <Cork> Tingle: just define the animation in css and use toggleClass or addClass/removeClass
[08:31:27] <Velveeta> tingle: it would definitely be nice if they did some feature checking for animation support and fell back on js animations, true, but you'd also lose some functionality in the way of things like animation promise objects that are returned for chaining off of the end of events
[08:31:48] <Velveeta> end of animations*, not events
[08:31:58] <Cork> Tingle: personally i've moved to not do js animations at all, and just doing css animations
[08:32:18] <Cork> animations is rarely important enough that you can't live without it on old browsers
[08:32:31] <Velveeta> right, like rounded corners
[08:32:39] <Cork> (and yes in those extremely rare cases you could write a js fallback)
[08:32:45] <Cork> or gradients
[08:32:52] <Velveeta> which should just die in general anyway
[08:33:06] <Velveeta> i'm a much bigger fan of flat design
[08:33:19] <Velveeta> and not just for the ease of implementation
[08:33:22] <Cork> gradients can be used for much more then just gradients :)
[08:33:37] <Tingle> I use this
[08:33:38] <Tingle> http://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced
[08:33:42] <Cork> barber pole animation spinner for example :D
[08:33:44] <Tingle> are you saying its a bad idea to do so?
[08:33:59] <Tingle> and this http://github.com/jquery/jquery-color for animating color & gradients
[08:34:13] <Cork> Tingle: i'm saying i don't personally like moving my css files into my js files
[08:34:29] <Cork> Tingle: i'm quite strict about having the data in html, style+animations in css
[08:34:34] <drecute> How do I check a list of supported modules that make up the latest build of jquery
[08:34:34] <Cork> and js does the actions
[08:35:03] <Cork> drecute: by modules do you mean plugins?
[08:35:05] <Cork> or?
[08:35:10] <Velveeta> drecute: what do you mean? 3rd party modules that work w/ the latest build?
[08:35:10] <drecute> yes
[08:35:25] <Tingle> so you dont use jquery ui or anything like that? pure css/html display and animation?
[08:35:27] <Cork> drecute: plugins normally state what version they work with
[08:35:30] <Velveeta> i don't know if there's a way to just bring up a list of those
[08:35:31] <drecute> for example, I want to check if deferred is built with it by default
[08:35:36] <Velveeta> right, you'd have to search each one individually
[08:35:44] <Cork> Tingle: i use jquery ui, but not animate()
[08:35:55] <Tingle> you use addclass() instead of animate
[08:35:56] <Velveeta> tingle: i think that plugin you pointed to looks pretty interesting
[08:35:59] <Cork> Tingle: i use addClass/toggleClass/removeClass instead
[08:36:07] <Cork> Tingle: yes
[08:36:09] <Tingle> what about timing things
[08:36:19] <Tingle> like animation, and stop and do something else
[08:36:19] <Cork> you can do that in css too
[08:36:30] <Cork> css does that by default
[08:36:30] <Tingle> realy? didnt know that
[08:36:36] <Velveeta> right, you just have to know at development time how long an animation is gonna take
[08:36:36] <Tingle> thought css is stuff styles
[08:36:38] <Cork> if you remove a class again
[08:36:38] <drecute> how do I check if deferred is built with it?
[08:36:45] <Velveeta> as opposed to at runtime just passing a duration
[08:36:47] <Cork> it moves from where it currently is to the correct position
[08:36:58] <Cork> even if it haven't made it all the way to the end
[08:37:13] <Cork> Tingle: so animations is actually much simpler to do with plain css then with js
[08:37:29] <Tingle> mm intersting
[08:37:40] <jop008> I have this $(document).ready(function () {   alert ("test"); alert not fired
[08:37:47] <Tingle> but then you have to know your animation length and set timed triggers for code to run when they are 'done' or at least you think they are done
[08:37:49] <Velveeta> i would argue though, that chaining animations is more difficult to do that way… but that's not a typical use case, and for a more business-type use case, not typically something you'd see done anyway
[08:37:55] <Tingle> considering css doesnt give you any callbacks?
[08:38:07] <Velveeta> tingle: right
[08:38:27] <Velveeta> jop: not sure what's going on there, that should work just fine
[08:38:29] <Cork> Velveeta: well for a common pattern; i've made a slideshow with plain css
[08:38:36] <Cork> and it was just a few lines of css
[08:38:46] <Cork> (and 4-5 lines of js)
[08:39:16] <Velveeta> yeah, the css slideshows are definitely more fun to watch than something like slideshare, the rotating transitions and whatnot are nifty
[08:39:25] <Tingle> Cork, what if the browser doesnt support that css animation, you have no fallback?
[08:39:44] <Cork> Tingle: they move to the end position without animation yes
[08:39:50] <Velveeta> well, like he was saying a few minutes ago, animations are rarely necessary enough that you can't disallow them on older browsers
[08:39:54] <Cork> Tingle: it normally doesn't look that bad actually
[08:40:03] <Velveeta> like a fade effect can just revert to a 0s hide
[08:40:15] <Tingle> hmm, thats why I like this jquery lib, it uses a css animation if the browser has it, and if not, uses the jquery animations
[08:40:35] <Cork> Tingle: but it complicates the code
[08:40:58] <Cork> as you have to pull the data from css into js to do it
[08:41:08] <Cork> or even worse store the css data in js
[08:41:18] <Tingle> all I have to do is use the jquery.animate() function
[08:41:22] <Tingle> the lib does the rest
[08:41:24] <Tingle> behind the scenes
[08:41:39] <Cork> Tingle: well you will have to get the positions from somewhere to use animate
[08:42:14] <Cork> and that is the "complicating" i talked about
[08:42:39] <Tingle> but its nothing I have to do, the library does it - so my code is still clean with a simple .animate() function
[08:42:46] <Tingle> or you mean that the behind the scenes gets messy
[08:42:56] <Cork> Tingle: when you call animate you need to tell it where to animate to
[08:43:13] <Cork> ex .animate({ left: '500px' }, 'slow')
[08:43:18] <Tingle> ah yeah
[08:43:20] <Cork> THAT is css
[08:43:24] <Cork> and should not be in js
[08:43:28] <Tingle> ah ok
[08:43:29] <Tingle> now I get it
[08:43:35] <Cork> so either you have to pull it from css or store it in js
[08:43:48] <Tingle> guess thats a personal preference then
[08:43:50] <Cork> with css animation you don't have to care about that in js
[08:44:04] <Cork> you just do $().addClass('visible');
[08:44:06] <Cork> and you're done
[08:44:19] <Tingle> then you can edit the values int he css file where they belong
[08:44:19] <Velveeta> right, each dev has to find their own line in the sand between exclusively storing display info in css vs storing it as behavioral in the js
[08:44:22] <Tingle> I get the logic behind that
[08:44:28] <Cork> Tingle: well it is manageability
[08:44:43] <Cork> Tingle: it is much simpler to modify the page if all styles are in the css file
[08:45:01] <Tingle> I see that, think I might adapt that in my next projekt
[08:45:02] <Cork> and not scattered around in inline styles, js and css
[08:45:06] <Tingle> project*
[08:45:07] <Velveeta> some people might argue though, that by storing animations in the css, that should be considered a behavioral aspect :D
[08:45:16] <Velveeta> i wouldn't personally, but i could see the merit if they did
[08:45:30] <Cork> Velveeta: and i agree with them actually
[08:46:02] <Cork> but the alternative would be to have a forth standard for animations
[08:46:23] <Velveeta> let's just all move back to flash
[08:46:28] <Cork> >_<
[08:46:30] * Velveeta ducks
[08:46:33] <Velveeta> lol
[08:46:35] <Cork> i don't even have flash installed :)
[08:46:47] <Tingle> god I wish flash would die already
[08:46:55] <Velveeta> i do, but not for anything development-wise, only because portions of the internet still use it
[08:47:11] <Tingle> youtube should drop flash and do it in html5
[08:47:12] <Cork> the closest thing i have is shumway :)
[08:47:21] <Cork> Tingle: they can't
[08:47:22] <Velveeta> gordon shumway?
[08:47:28] <Tingle> and all new web games should go webgl
[08:47:32] <Cork> ?g mozilla shumway
[08:47:32] <b-ot> Cork: mozilla/shumway · GitHub → https://github.com/mozilla/shumway
[08:47:58] <Velveeta> there's a game someone threw out the other day on our FEE Skype channel at work, written in webgl, simple to play, and friggin addictve
[08:47:59] <Tingle> why not Cork, default to flash for older browsers?
[08:48:07] <Velveeta> http://hellorun.helloenjoy.com/
[08:48:12] <Cork> Tingle: youtube isn't fully <video> cause you could skip the ads if they do
[08:48:49] <Cork> Tingle: youtube defaults to <video> for all clips that doens't have the intro ad clip in them
[08:48:57] <Cork> cause those depend on flash to force you to see it
[08:49:05] <Tingle> mm
[08:49:10] <Cork> (though you can block that :P)
[08:49:12] <Tingle> that hellorun, its basicly temple run
[08:49:17] <Tingle> :P
[08:49:50] <Velveeta> yeah kind of, but with a reduced feature set, since you only need to worry about going up or down :)
[08:50:25] <Tingle> yeah
[08:50:26] <Tingle> still fun
[08:50:27] <Tingle> nice music
[08:50:42] <Tingle> but I wonder why it jerks every once in a while
[08:51:01] <Tingle> doesnt seem to be vsync issues
[08:51:02] <Velveeta> mine doesn't
[08:51:16] <Tingle> what browser you running?
[08:51:22] <Cork> btw have you guys seen the web based gamebody emolator grantg wrote?
[08:51:29] <Velveeta> mac/chrome
[08:51:30] <Velveeta> i haven't
[08:51:50] <Tingle> ah k, i tried firefox
[08:51:58] <Cork> hmm let me see if i can find it
[08:51:59] <Tingle> why is firefox beginning to suck :/ I <3 ff
[08:52:07] <krambiorix> hi, when i drag a draggable to a droppable and then remove it from the droppable (click on delete icon in the draggable) it is put back in the initial div.... But it's not draggable anymore... What can i do?
[08:52:11] <Tingle> its jquery animations arent as smooth as in chrome
[08:52:17] <Tingle> and webgl isnt either
[08:52:32] <Tingle> overall its animations arent as smooth as in chrome, even css ones
[08:52:40] <shwaiil> hi
[08:52:53] <Velveeta> krambiorix: when you remove it and put it back in the draggable, how are you removing it?
[08:53:08] <Velveeta> .remove().appendTo(), or .detach(), or what?
[08:53:11] <sharpy35> one stupid question. i am modelling a database for a jquery app and i am always getting confused about something like Varchar(25) or so. Does the 25 means 25 chars or 25 BITS?
[08:53:17] <sharpy35> i guess its meant chars right?
[08:53:20] <Cork> bah looks like has taken it down :/
[08:53:38] <Velveeta> sharpy: for varchar fields, that's 25 bytes i *believe*
[08:53:47] <Velveeta> meaning multibyte characters would take up more storage space
[08:53:53] <Tingle> you guys know any reasons why chrome > FF for webrendering performance...?
[08:53:56] <shwaiil> Q: What's the best way to check for State of an element ? Let's say open/close, etc. Should I use data-attr=boolean ? What's the best practice ? Thanks
[08:54:06] <sharpy35> but how about INT(11) are that 11 BITS there?
[08:54:08] <Velveeta> tingle: because chrome > FF for everythinnnnnng! :D
[08:54:12] <Tingle> webgaming for max performance would require the user to get chrome if he wants better quality
[08:54:31] <Velveeta> shwalil: so it's less expensive to do a check for a class or something than it is to check a data attribute
[08:54:42] <Velveeta> that being said, it's better practice to use a data attribute than a class name for storing state
[08:54:43] <Tingle> well usability and look'n'feel, I think FF is better, but thats my personal preference,
[08:55:01] <Velveeta> from there, you need to make your own decision on what's the "better" way, that's a judgement call
[08:55:22] <shwaiil> Velveeta, thanks for looking! It's better to toggle class ?
[08:55:32] <Cork> Tingle: well most of firefox is actually looking really good, the only thing i'm really sad about is it's ui
[08:55:45] <Cork> and sadly it looks like the future will be worse
[08:55:47] <Velveeta> sharpy: i can't remember how the int sizing works, but all that stuff can be found on something like the mysql docs page
[08:56:07] <Tingle> the UI?
[08:56:09] <sharpy35> ok thanks Velveeta, i'll check the docs out :)
[08:56:16] <Tingle> why, its staying true to the standard desktop ui feeling
[08:56:27] <Velveeta> start here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-requirements.html
[08:56:33] <Cork> Tingle: they are rewriting the theme
[08:56:34] <Velveeta> oh, they're gone already
[08:56:44] <krambiorix> Velveeta, with a button on it: el.closest(".balans_item").parent.removeChild(el);
[08:56:47] <Tingle> o
[08:56:48] <Cork> Tingle: and lost of customizability gets removed
[08:56:53] <Cork> *lots
[08:56:57] <Tingle> why would they do that :/
[08:57:01] <Tingle> thats the only reason I use FF
[08:57:10] <Tingle> because of the customization possiblities
[08:57:13] <Tingle> and plugins
[08:57:14] <Cork> cause thy want to target the users that don't use it
[08:57:21] <Tingle> -_-
[08:57:27] <Velveeta> shwalil: toggling a class to denote a boolean state is less expensive of an operation, so you might want to consider that if designing web apps for like smartphones
[08:57:41] <Cork> Tingle: what they do is lock down what you can do to the elements in the navigation bar
[08:57:48] <Velveeta> but it's not exactly great practice for scalable design, i prefer to use data attributes to store state
[08:57:49] <Cork> Tingle: they remove the bottom bar
[08:57:53] <Cork> and a few other things
[08:57:57] <Tingle> well still, chromes webgl & animation in css and jquery is smoother than firefox, even IE has smoother animations that firefox >.>
[08:58:27] <Cork> Tingle: from my experience it depends on what you do
[08:58:37] <Cork> all browsers win in there areas
[08:58:42] <Cork> and lose in others
[08:58:49] <Tingle> im just talking rendering performance atm
[08:58:55] <Tingle> animations
[08:58:56] <Tingle> webgl
[08:58:56] <Cork> the only one i know is in a quite bade state is safari
[08:59:08] <Velveeta> krambiorix: so, when you remove that element from the document, you're destroying the draggable reference
[08:59:14] <Cork> Tingle: that is included in the things i talk about
[08:59:29] <Velveeta> krambiorix: if you then add another element to the draggable container, you have to redeclare it as a draggable element
[08:59:29] <krambiorix> Velveeta, what can i do about that
[08:59:31] <Cork> Tingle: you can't say things like that generically, cause it depends on what you do
[09:00:13] <Velveeta> when you recreate that element in the draggable container, fire .draggable on the container again, i'm pretty sure that forces it to recheck its children and declare any that aren't currently draggable, as draggable
[09:00:23] <Tingle> well I have this basic opacity and height animation, opened up in IE FF and Chrome, IE and Chrome render it smoothly, FF is all jerky and sluggish
[09:00:28] <Velveeta> i'm double-checking that though
[09:00:42] <Cork> Tingle: that is one case yes
[09:01:10] <Tingle> and that webgl game I just tried, FF has jerks here and there for no aparent reason, whereas chrome gave me what my hardware offers
[09:01:18] <jop008> If I make a fixed page I can update a div when I inject it as html string as a child of page I can not update the field
[09:01:20] <Cork> Velveeta: ah, i found his github page at least https://github.com/grantgalitz/GameBoy-Online
[09:01:23] <Tingle> maybe my FF is configured wrong or something
[09:01:29] <Cork> though he has taken the website down
[09:01:33] <Cork> Tingle: no
[09:01:47] <Velveeta> krambiorix: yeah, that looks like the case, check this stack overflow page: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9799761/jquery-ui-draggable-is-not-working-on-newly-created-dom-element
[09:01:56] <spobat> hi
[09:02:03] <spobat> how can I optimize this jquery snippet?
[09:02:04] <spobat> $('#channel-attendees-entries').children().each(function(i, e) { var $e=$(e); if($e.text() === 'Robert') { console.log($e.attr('id')); } });
[09:02:13] <spobat> issue: I have to iterate over all children :SS
[09:02:15] <Cork> Tingle: they are working on improving those areas, but it is't as simple and just fixing the performance there, they have to make sure they don't regress performance where they are good today
[09:02:20] <jop008> both functions work in the document ready status
[09:02:40] <jop008> so how do you know the timng of the functions?
[09:03:04] <jop008> It looks like in safari there is different timing than in Chrome
[09:03:07] <Velveeta> spobat: $('#channel-attendees-entries:contains(Robert)').each(function () { console.log(this.id); });
[09:03:10] <Velveeta> try that^^^
[09:03:12] <Tingle> Cork, I suppose - Im wanting to make a webgl game client in the future, and until they do that, I have to suggest the users to use chrome as the browser of choice :O
[09:03:14] <spobat> ah, awesome :D
[09:03:17] <spobat> thanks Velveeta
[09:03:35] <Velveeta> no problemo
[09:03:39] <spobat> Velveeta:  well it's li:contains or else
[09:03:42] <spobat> to select the children
[09:03:46] <Cork> Tingle: like i said, you can't answer that question like that
[09:03:55] <Velveeta> oh yeah, well there ya go :)
[09:03:59] <Cork> Tingle: some games is much faster in firefox then chrome
[09:04:00] <Velveeta> jop: i'm not sure i understand your question
[09:04:13] <Cork> and some is faster in ie and some in chrome
[09:04:15] <Tingle> how can that be, its all about the webgl rendering performance
[09:04:23] <Cork> Tingle: it depends on what the game does
[09:04:30] <Tingle> render frames...
[09:04:31] <Tingle> `?
[09:04:34] <Tingle> or what do you mean
[09:04:39] <Cork> Tingle: it depends on what the browser has optimized for
[09:04:52] <Cork> when you optimize for one you tend to regress another
[09:05:00] <Tingle> mm like, I thought there was only one way to render frames, fill it and push to gfx
[09:05:21] <Cork> Tingle: not even close
[09:05:25] <Velveeta> i think maybe what he's saying is that there's more than just filling the frame
[09:05:37] <Cork> firefox it self has 5 or 6 ways to render a frame
[09:05:49] <Cork> chrome is 3-4 if i remember correctly
[09:05:51] <Cork> might be more
[09:05:57] <Tingle> :O
[09:06:08] <Velveeta> and you also have to take into account anything that's used to mathematically figure out the state of that frame
[09:06:20] <Tingle> so jscript performance
[09:06:21] <Velveeta> some browsers have better functional implementations than others
[09:06:28] <Cork> and where the pixels are coming from
[09:06:37] <Cork> as you have to do cross domain checking too
[09:06:49] <Cork> if the computer can do hw acceleration or not
[09:06:52] <Cork> and so on
[09:06:54] <Velveeta> so where one might have a lightning fast way of rendering the pixels, maybe its mathematical implementations aren't as good as another
[09:07:42] <Cork> good example of that is trying to move an element with rounded corners in ff and chrome
[09:07:43] <Tingle> i think FF has javascript issues, causing jumps/jerks
[09:07:53] <Cork> the rounded corner gets lost in chrome while it stays in ff
[09:07:58] <Tingle> thats why the animations jerk abit and the webgl rendering jerks
[09:07:59] <Cork> Tingle: no
[09:08:01] <Cork> it isn't js
[09:08:11] <Cork> it is mainly that firefox does most things in one thread
[09:08:24] <Cork> ui and all pages you have loaded runs in the same thread
[09:08:38] <Tingle> oh, so FF doesnt utilize multithreading?
[09:08:40] <Cork> that also means gc can be a problem
[09:08:43] <Cork> it does
[09:08:44] <Tingle> and chrome/IE does
[09:08:52] <Cork> no they utilize multi processes
[09:08:56] <Cork> that is totally different
[09:09:16] <Cork> there isn't a single multi threaded rendering engine on the market today
[09:09:24] <Cork> and js is single threaded by design
[09:09:44] <Tingle> mm then wouldnt there be a way to tell JS to run everything on the page or the canvas in its own thread?
[09:09:49] <Cork> servo is (truly) multi threaded
[09:09:55] <Tingle> so its doesnt get influences by the rest of the browser/page
[09:09:56] <Cork> but it is still in pre pre alpha
[09:10:08] <Cork> Tingle: no
[09:10:19] <Tingle> mm
[09:10:19] <Cork> cause of how js and dom work
[09:10:37] <Cork> you would have memory violations and risk of deadlocks of you do
[09:10:45] <Cork> that's why webworkers was added
[09:10:47] <Tingle> then what would one have to do to get a smooth performance in FF? close all other windows and have the canvas the only thing running in one tab?
[09:11:18] <Cork> Tingle: well making sure you don't produce gc that you don't have to is an important start
[09:11:47] <Tingle> so chrome has its GC in its own thread
[09:11:48] <Cork> cause gc locks is a serious problem still (they haven't finished the multi generational gc yet)
[09:11:57] <Cork> no
[09:12:03] <Cork> again you can't have gc on a thread
[09:12:08] <Cork> you have to freez the app to do gc
[09:12:19] <Tingle> im only asking why chrome&IE has a lag free visual experience while FF does not :O
[09:12:21] <Cork> but chrome uses multi generatioal gc
[09:12:28] <Cork> or so called nursery
[09:12:41] <Tingle> you said because FF does everything on one thread - which tells me the others do it differently
[09:12:42] <Cork> so it only has to check a small section with short interval
[09:12:51] <Cork> so there is less js shapes to traverse
[09:13:07] <Cork> Tingle: yes, the ui in firefox is written in js
[09:13:12] <Cork> thats called "chrome js"
[09:13:23] <Cork> then you have the js in the page
[09:13:26] <Cork> thats "content js"
[09:13:35] <Cork> then you have rendering of the chrome ui
[09:13:40] <Cork> and rendering of the content page
[09:13:46] <Cork> all this is done in one thread
[09:14:06] <Cork> then they have background threads that do database lookups, cache fetches, network and so on
[09:14:16] <Cork> but as all pages runs in one big thread
[09:14:23] <Tingle> k
[09:14:26] <Cork> so if, ex gmail does a big batch of js work
[09:14:37] <Tingle> and why is the performance jerky in FF compared to the others..?
[09:14:40] <Cork> you page in a different tab will slowdown and animation will jerk
[09:15:13] <Cork> Tingle: much is gc, some is cause the js stack becomes bigger cause it is in one process
[09:15:36] <Cork> though there is downsides to using multi process solutions too
[09:15:38] <Tingle> mm so FF just has a bad implementation of a GC
[09:15:55] <Cork> firefox is by far the most memory efficient browser on the market in per tab
[09:16:04] <Cork> (and actually in close to all cases)
[09:16:17] <Cork> Tingle: not bad, just a simpler one
[09:16:51] <Cork> implementing nursery means they have to rewrite the entire browsers memory references
[09:17:04] <Cork> so it is a humongous job
[09:17:24] <SarahFarenheight> Hi
[09:17:25] <Cork> cause a memory area can move
[09:17:29] <Tingle> yeah
[09:17:53] <SarahFarenheight> I have been googling for an hour on how to do a listview with plain jquery/jquery-ui. can someone point me in the right direction?
[09:17:59] <Tingle> still, I dont realy have a anwere to why FF animations and webgl performance is jerky compared to IE&Chrome :/
[09:18:12] <Cork> SarahFarenheight: listview?
[09:18:18] <Tingle> answere*
[09:18:19] <Cork> SarahFarenheight: are you talking about a grid or what?
[09:18:27] <Velveeta> or like an option list?
[09:18:33] <SarahFarenheight> well I need a list in which each line is clickable
[09:18:39] <SarahFarenheight> with headers etc
[09:18:42] <Cork> Tingle: like i said, it depends on what you do
[09:18:47] <SarahFarenheight> when I click it populates the fields, to edit them
[09:18:51] <Velveeta> is it a multi-column list?
[09:18:58] <SarahFarenheight> yes. kind of like an excel grid
[09:19:07] <Cork> ?g jquery jqgrid
[09:19:08] <b-ot> Cork: jqGrid: jQuery Grid Plugin → http://www.trirand.com/
[09:19:26] <Tingle> Cork, css animations, jquery animations, webgl rendering - anything :O
[09:19:59] <SarahFarenheight> thank you
[09:20:02] <Cork> Tingle: like i said, it depends on WHAT you animate and HOW
[09:20:17] <SarahFarenheight> a little overkill, but it will do for now
[09:20:20] <SarahFarenheight> thanks guys
[09:20:24] <Cork> Tingle: you can't blankly say "it's always slower" cause that isn't true
[09:21:19] <SarahFarenheight> I'm sorry, but does it support images etc? Can't see it in the demo pages
[09:21:45] <Cork> SarahFarenheight: you might have to tinker with it
[09:21:49] <Cork> but it should be possible
[09:22:54] <krambiorix> a bit late but thanks Velveeta !
[09:23:51] <SarahFarenheight> alright, thanks
[09:24:49] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[09:25:07] <Tingle> Cork: I was just googeling around, it seems everyone just says that FF just has a render problem up to the current version. so it needs some bug fixing
[09:25:46] <Cork> Tingle: ya, well random ppl on the web rarely actually look into what it's about
[09:25:56] <Cork> and just checks a few common positions
[09:26:14] <Tingle> well its alot of threads and quite a few mozilla bugtracker entries
[09:26:41] <Cork> Tingle: i never ever said there isn't position where there are problems
[09:26:52] <Tingle> for example: "Firefox doesn't like style properties to be set at partial pixels (eg: top:230.6px)"
[09:27:01] <Cork> what i does not agree with is the blank slate "always" you refer to
[09:28:04] <Tingle> hmm, seemed like always to me - but I get what your going at. 'always' is animations and rendering smoothness for me atm consideirng thats all im messing with :P
[09:29:21] <Cork> Tingle: i've seen plenty of examples where ppl has had performance problems in chrome where it works just fine in ff
[09:29:32] <Cork> Tingle: and yes that is why i don't accept your statement
[09:29:59] <Cork> the gameboy emulator i talked about before is one of them
[09:30:48] <Cork> (not sure how many of the problems he saw that are still active in chrome though, it was after all over a year ago)
[09:38:00] <jkoudys> Any ideas how I could make this page not render the text until the font's downloaded? It's kind of jarring seeing it load then quickly change fonts: http://janeswalk.tv/
[10:02:53] <jop008> In chome I have http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-09-14_at_7.01.02_PM-0Zh6WJyA.png in Safari this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-09-14_at_7.00.45_PM-7XnjPfLC.png
[10:03:17] <jop008> I want to make them the same and pixelperfect who can help?
[10:03:42] <jop008> If I improve it in safari chome gets worse and the other way around
[10:04:27] <Tingle> Cork: can I pm you
[10:08:14] <jop008> Cork doesn't like pm :-)
[10:12:27] <spobat> hey
[10:12:44] <spobat> what's the best way to color some elements in an iframe
[10:12:57] <spobat> the iframe is from one of our sites as well.
[10:13:05] <spobat> but it's intended to be used as embeddable client
[10:13:13] <Velveeta> i would say css
[10:13:23] <spobat> it should be dynamic
[10:13:57] <spobat> the plugin changes over time, and thus "user defined" functions have to be called, which colorize/modify the layout
[10:14:15] <spobat> those user-definde functions shouldn't be inside the iframe, but in the parent frame
[10:19:45] <Velveeta> i don't do too much work myself as far as referencing iframes from parent documents
[10:20:13] <Velveeta> i do know the same domain policy applies, and that you should grab the iframe's contentWindow or contentDocument object, depending on what browser you're in
[10:34:00] <JackJones> hi, how i could select the data-pk attribute ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a2d90618b714e21c52dd
[10:37:23] <shoky> JackJones: var e = $('.editable'); e.editable({... + e.data('pk') })
[10:38:36] <JackJones> shokey: thanks, but how i could do that in my function self ?
[10:39:26] <shoky> what?
[10:39:44] <Velveeta> you have to assign a variable reference to do it like what you're asking, or use .each to iterate over the editables and let jquery assign the scope
[10:40:03] <Velveeta> at the time you're trying to use $(this).attr to get that attribute, 'this' is the window object
[10:41:13] <Velveeta> you'd want to do something like this: $('.editable').each(function() { $(this).editable({ … , url: '/task/edit/' + $(this).data('pk') }); });
[10:42:54] <JackJones> okay, this way is wrong ?https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6563974
[10:43:14] <JackJones> ?
[10:43:28] <shoky> yes
[10:44:17] <JackJones> okay, i will try to find a solution witch "each"….. thank you all!
[10:44:37] <shoky> Velveeta already gave you the solution
[10:45:39] <JackJones> shoky: yes, i try to add the solution in my script
[11:19:20] <Asmooh> yo!
[11:21:09] <Velveeta> yo!
[11:29:31] <grafi> no!
[12:03:08] <mdev> I use the same image over and over but I need a unique way to identify it to pull data from the database when clicked, since the ID is unique yet the class is the same can I set a global click listen callback on the class?
[12:03:18] <mdev> or what's a better way to do that other than making id unique
[12:05:56] <LiENUS> anyone here familiar with chardin.js?
[12:06:10] <Velveeta> i would set a click listener for the class name, and use the id of the one clicked as your unique identifier
[12:06:52] <Velveeta> i've never used chardin myself, but i just googled it, and it may work nicely for something recently requested at work
[12:06:54] <mdev> alright great thanks
[12:08:35] <LiENUS> Velveeta, lol
[12:08:51] <LiENUS> its a bit buggy with a few things, i submitted a fix for xhtml in the issue tracker
[12:09:05] <LiENUS> though i dont know the architecture well enough to do a proper patch/pull request
[12:09:07] <Velveeta> nice, we'd probably tear it apart and just use it as a base anyway ;)
[12:09:10] <LiENUS> soo hopefully he sees it
[12:09:23] <LiENUS> i wrote a wrapper around it to load in any of my pages to make f1 toggle it
[12:09:34] <LiENUS> so now if you dont know how to use a view press f1 and it pops up a help
[12:10:18] <Velveeta> nice
[12:13:01] <LiENUS> alas i keep running into issues
[12:13:14] <LiENUS> in their demo page their text that is in a span with data-intro pops out with it
[12:13:17] <LiENUS> on my page... nope :/
[12:13:36] <LiENUS> the inputs and tables pop out but my labels for some reason fade into the background when the overlay comes up
[12:14:35] <Velveeta> have you checked their zindexes and positioning?
[12:17:26] <LiENUS> i dont do any zindex, it looks like its a color issue
[12:17:31] <LiENUS> if i tilt my head just right i can see them greyed out
[12:18:05] <LiENUS> chardin SHOULD auto handle all the zindex stuff and i dont do any zindex in my css... so it shouldnt be that
[12:18:08] <LiENUS> though i suppose its possible
[12:18:35] <Velveeta> in that case, what you can do is apply a translate rule to rotate the entire page contents the opposite direction from your head tilt, so that you can see them greyed out without having to tilt
[12:18:42] <Velveeta> fixed! :D
[12:19:12] <Velveeta> so it looks like it's just a css color issue then?
[12:19:23] <Velveeta> is there a page we can see this in action?
[12:24:33] <LiENUS> Velveeta, i have a sneaking suspicion in older browsers that dont support xhtml properly that it works fine...
[12:24:43] <LiENUS> http://vetmanage.com/porff/2.0/?page=Client&clientid=8
[12:25:30] <Velveeta> ok, so i'm in chrome, and this looks fine as far as i can see
[12:26:06] <LiENUS> press f1?
[12:26:10] <Velveeta> yep
[12:26:28] <Velveeta> i see labels for things like "avoid using these fields for entering any new phone numbers" "don't forget to save" etc
[12:26:29] <LiENUS> i cant read work phone number or home phone number when the overlay is up
[12:26:40] <Velveeta> and they stand out white against the modal blacked out layer
[12:26:45] <Velveeta> ahhhhh gotcha
[12:27:06] <LiENUS> also the phone numbers table doesnt line up with its tag though i think thats recent
[12:27:08] <Velveeta> yeah i don't have those either
[12:27:20] <Velveeta> and yes i see that issue also
[12:27:30] <LiENUS> the table works fine in ff
[12:27:58] <LiENUS> but not the text
[12:28:09] <LiENUS> i think the table is a bug in chardin itself but the text is a bug in my stuff
[12:37:03] <Velveeta> ok, as far as the label is concerned, it looks like it's inheriting the body 'color' property of #333
[12:37:10] <Velveeta> which is making it pretty much blend into that background
[12:37:19] <Velveeta> that's coming from your default.css file, line 3
[12:38:27] <Velveeta> now, i have no idea why none of those other labels are blending into that modal layer...
[12:38:36] <Velveeta> because they all seem to be getting #333 for their colo
[12:38:38] <Velveeta> r
[12:38:55] <LiENUS> the chardin.js demo shows it making the text come to the top though
[12:39:03] <LiENUS> and changing its properties
[12:39:18] <Velveeta> right, this text is at the top, it's wrapped in a span that sets it to z-index 9999999 or something
[12:39:40] <LiENUS> http://heelhook.github.io/chardin.js/ his baked with <3 bit
[12:40:29] <LiENUS> starts our black when its brought to the top it turns grey
[12:40:53] <Velveeta> gotcha, it should be #ccc it looks like, according to that
[12:41:03] <Velveeta> let me see if i can figure out why yours isn't
[12:41:13] <LiENUS> hes got a couple of chardinjs-show-element css tags that i'm guessing is what he uses
[12:41:57] <LiENUS> yeah thats it i just need a .chardinjs-show-element {color:#ccc}
[12:41:57] <LiENUS>  in there
[12:42:16] <LiENUS> but then it messes up my input labels lol
[12:43:04] <Velveeta> oh yeah, i thought there was a standard css file it shipped with, and it just wasn't matching rules properly or something, but you're missing that #ccc rule in your version of the css file
[12:43:15] <Velveeta> and yes, i notice it also hoses that button text
[12:43:23] <LiENUS> there is a standard css file it ships with it just doesnt include that rule
[12:43:58] <Velveeta> weird
[12:44:03] <Velveeta> and as for those buttons
[12:44:15] <Velveeta> the buttons toward the bottom of that form don't have that problem
[12:44:25] <Velveeta> they're wrapped in a span of class charinjs-show-element
[12:44:36] <Velveeta> whereas the buttons at the top have that class applied directly to them
[12:44:58] <Velveeta> so however you're adding those bottom buttons to your chardin overlay, you may want to duplicate that method for the buttons at the top
[12:45:26] <imjakech_> ok people I need some help with this… pulling my hair out over this.. fitVids() is not working for me… I have the correct script tags, jQuery loaded, calling the fitVids on the correct div with correct class.
[12:45:29] <imjakech_> no errors.
[12:45:34] <imjakech_> but nothing shows up
[12:46:17] <Velveeta> is there a page we can see it in action?
[12:46:32] <imjakech_> ->  http://paste.pm/9m9.js
[12:46:34] <imjakech_> this is what I have
[12:46:39] <imjakech_> everything is local
[12:46:48] <LiENUS> meh i added css to override the chardinjs stuff for buttons
[12:47:00] <Tingle> out of curiosity what kind of web development patterns/structures do you guys use to organize and manage your code?
[12:47:04] <imjakech_> funny thing is, it hasn't worked for me with 2 of my last sites..
[12:47:12] <imjakech_> but all the sites before that all the code is still working
[12:47:19] <imjakech_> I even copied all of the sites with working code
[12:47:22] <imjakech_> and still doesn't work
[12:47:37] <imjakech_> at first I thought it was a Ustream cross protocol error stoping it from being loaded
[12:47:56] <imjakech_> but nope, all the other javascript I put in works, just fitVids not working
[12:49:18] <LiENUS> Tingle, to organize javascript code?
[12:49:22] <LiENUS> or web code in general?
[12:49:28] <LiENUS> including backend code
[12:49:39] <Tingle> yes, general
[12:50:20] <LiENUS> i'm using mvc for my current one
[12:50:32] <Tingle> mvc with cakephp?
[12:51:13] <digitalmediaguy> Hello everyone… Trying to figure out why my Masonry layout looks great on initial load… then animates to a two column layout? Have implemented imagesLoaded plugin and have tried changing the columnWidth settings a bunch… anyone a masonry / isotope master? ;)  http://artisticjunkie.myshopify.com/

[12:54:09] <LiENUS> i*
[12:54:33] <LiENUS> tables are buggier in general in chrome with chardin
[12:55:05] <Nesis_> hello
[12:55:18] <Nesis_> Anyone with the will to help?
[12:56:20] <Velveeta> just throw a question out there and we'll answer if we can
[12:56:55] <Nesis_> I am able to single show .txt content with this, but i need to do it with multiple files
[12:56:55] <Nesis_> http://jsfiddle.net/u4vFe/23/
[12:58:46] <Velveeta> can you just change the showout.value = this.result; to showout.value += this.result; ?
[12:58:52] <imjakech_> no one? really?
[12:58:53] <imjakech_> lol
[13:00:17] <Nesis_> That did not work
[13:00:26] <Velveeta> imjakech: sorry, i know *of* fitvids, but have never used it before
[13:02:51] <LiENUS> im out
[13:03:16] <Velveeta> adios, good luck
[13:19:37] * cjwelborn is bored
[13:20:21] * cjwelborn is bored
[13:51:10] <wer0ckz> hi. help please
[13:51:11] <wer0ckz> Hi. I'm using these codes: --> var debit1 = parseInt(debit).toFixed(2); total_balance = total_balance + debit1; <-- value of debit1 = 1111.00 and  30.00 - total_balance is Total Balance: 01111.0030.00 - it should be 1141.00
[13:52:24] <wer0ckz> toFixed is not properly working on my end. any ideas where did i miss?
[13:55:40] <cjwelborn> looks like its concatenating strings instead of adding numbers.
[13:57:37] <wer0ckz> help please. how to fix my code?
[13:59:20] <cjwelborn> toFixed converts it into a string. adding 123 + "123.11" = "123123.11".
[13:59:57] <wer0ckz> got it thank youj
[14:15:09] <doug65536> wer0ckz: don't do that. cents cannot be precisely represented in floating point numbers. you should have all monetary values in cents and divide by 100 for display only
[14:15:44] <doug65536> js> print((.1).toFixed(20))
[14:15:52] <b-ot> doug65536: 0.10000000000000000555
[14:16:16] <Velveeta> rightio, in js, 1.1 + 1.1 doesn't necessarily equal 2.2
[14:24:31] <doug65536> up to 4,503,599,627,370,496 cents can be exactly represented in a double-precision value ($45,035,996,273,704.96)
[14:34:15] <traets> I have an ajax call inside an object's function. How can i, outside that object, know when the call is done? Here's a simple example of what im trying to do: http://tabbit.org/xps0Zudo
[14:36:00] <shoky> traets: return the jqXHR that is returned by $.getJSON from your function
[14:40:12] <traets> shoky: outsid the done() callback?  http://tabbit.org/kd5.Sh6yo
[14:41:22] <shoky> traets: yes but there's a nicer way to do this
[14:41:22] <traets> ah yes. thank you
[14:41:29] <traets> oh. what is it?
[14:42:52] <shoky> traets: something more like  http://tabbit.org/D8t5fhW
[14:44:01] <shoky> would be even nicer to have the productsReq as just a locally scoped var, but its fine like this too
[14:45:26] <cameron262> join #mah
[14:45:29] <traets> I see. thanks for the tip
[14:46:41] <traets> Is it possible to have that function inside productsReq? So initially productsReq would be a function, and its value would change to the json retrieved, making it not a function anymore
[14:47:13] <shoky> async stuff always requires callbacks
[14:49:09] <shoky> that is, if you want access to something you got with ajax, you'll always need to access it inside a callback. so i think the answer to your question is no, tho i didn't fully understand you
[14:49:47] <shoky> also, productsReq is not a function nor is it the data
[14:57:33] <traets> Yeah
[15:27:01] <JimmyXander> I want to make an awesome website, where people can post things and the get them thumbed up or down
[15:27:15] <JimmyXander> then*
[15:27:52] <Velveeta> $('body').awesomize(); // boom, done-zo
[15:28:04] <Velveeta> just go get the jquery-awesomeize plugin
[15:28:41] <JimmyXander> hell yeas, done and done
[15:28:49] <JimmyXander> now to plug this shit in yo
[15:29:20] <Velveeta> you should also check out the jquery-increaseConversionRate plugin
[15:29:32] <JimmyXander> oh yeah? right on yo
[15:29:35] <Velveeta> boost most sites' conversions by up to 20%, and you can just run it multiple times, it's stackable
[15:29:47] <JimmyXander> oh hell yea BOIIIII!
[15:29:50] <Velveeta> that's how bill gates made his fortune
[15:30:03] <JimmyXander> Well shit, watch out, here come gates 2.0
[15:30:21] <razzi> sigh
[15:30:26] <Velveeta> newer and improveder!
[15:30:34] <razzi> these days it's just to difficult to become a millionaire from coding
[15:30:35] <JimmyXander> that's right!
[15:30:47] <razzi> everybody codes now
[15:31:02] <JimmyXander> ideas make millions, not code
[15:31:51] <razzi> there's always one smart*ss
[15:32:10] <JimmyXander> hey do you have a link to that conversion rate doubler?
[15:32:15] <JimmyXander> It sounded pretty sweet
[15:34:57] <Velveeta> oh, damn, doesn't look like it's maintained anymore… but i can write you one to do the same thing in a snap
[15:36:00] <Velveeta> $('form[action="/cart/confirm"]').on('submit', function () { setInterval($.proxy(function () { $(this).trigger('submit'); }), 1); });
[15:36:12] <Velveeta> boom, done, now all of your conversions are * 1000!
[15:42:56] <JimmyXander> Sweet man it works great!
[15:43:13] <JimmyXander> I've already made three sales!
[15:43:23] <JimmyXander> you rock
[15:43:51] <Velveeta> oh, and just in case nobody spotted the asterix on that, do *not* put that code into your site, especially if you actually have a cart form that submits to /cart/confirm for final checkout :D
[15:45:15] <JimmyXander> Yes people we are only joking
[15:45:49] <Velveeta> that's probably obvious, but just in case it wasn't, i don't want people coming at me :D
[15:45:58] <JimmyXander> Seriously
[15:47:27] <JimmyXander> Though actually I am making a site, where people can post things. It's called JustVent.net. Sort of a place where people can come and vent about things in their life, anonymously if they want to, without having to worry about repercussions with work and or significant others.
[15:48:25] <Velveeta> nice
[15:48:29] <JimmyXander> Not the most original idea, but the only one that has really come close to achieving success is fmylife.com and that's become more about telling the funniest awkward story. I want to be a little more serious.
[15:48:59] <Velveeta> my wife loves fmylife
[15:49:06] <JimmyXander> its funny shit
[15:50:12] <shoky> note you'll compete with muttr.com whose tagline is 'Just Vent'
[15:50:23] <JimmyXander> yeah I know
[15:50:29] <JimmyXander> I've scoped out the competition
[15:50:37] <JimmyXander> Not really a lot of stellar design there
[15:52:11] <JimmyXander> I'm a designer by trade. So I'm hoping to be able to win on great design. Minimalism in both design and function to make it fast and easy.
[15:55:29] <JimmyXander> My biggest competition would really be something like twitter which is a catch all. SO I'm hoping to scoop up a niche of just venting.
[15:55:37] <JimmyXander> It's going to be a free service
[15:55:38] <JimmyXander> no ads
[15:56:20] <JimmyXander> and I'll just run it al long as I can out of pocket
[15:56:55] <shoky> okydoke, goodluck
[15:57:13] <JimmyXander> and then when people come on here and vent, like I'm doing now you can just tell em to STFU and do it @ Justvent.net
[15:57:23] <JimmyXander> ^_^
[15:59:59] <JimmyXander> Or you can give them sage advice and thell them that the anwer to all questions is  42 <!--[if lt IE 9]><html style="display:none;"><![endif]-->
[16:09:24] <JimmyXander> Do you think a site like that should allow comments?
[16:09:54] <JimmyXander> I don't, I think it should be a positive experience. Let people like it and share it.
[16:10:20] <JimmyXander> if they want to comment on something they can do it on their own network. Facebook, twitter, email, blog
[16:12:19] <JimmyXander> If you don't let them comment there, you might make things less popular, but you might also encourage more sharing by those who would have just previously only commented
[16:13:28] <T13|needsCoffee> Can someone look at http://enwp.org/User:Technical_13/SandBox/help-helper-tools.js isn't triggering the .getJSON call?
[16:14:47] <JimmyXander> I thought my aunty was the village pump
[16:14:51] <JimmyXander> I'm confused now
[16:15:44] <Matip> Hi
[16:15:52] <Matip> is it possible to change the annimation used by .hide?
[16:16:20] <Matip> never mind, I found it
[16:16:46] <JimmyXander> You could always write your own function that hides things the way you want it to
[16:23:01] <T13|needsCoffee> Anyone,
[16:23:07] <T13|needsCoffee> ?
[16:23:31] <Matip> I was looking for an animation like slideUp but there's a problem. it change the top position of the div being hidden
[16:23:49] <Matip> I can't find any animation like slideUp without this behaviour
[16:24:16] <Matip> ah, maybe it's the easing function
[16:25:35] <Matip> no, the easing function doesn't change that
[16:27:48] <BillCriswell> Matip: What is top after the sldie up?
[16:28:18] <Matip> http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[16:28:21] <Matip> check the example there
[16:28:36] <Matip> the box being animated goes up a little bit before it completely dissappear
[16:28:53] <Matip> you see what I mean?
[16:30:28] <BillCriswell> I don't see it sliding up I don't think? Here's my test: http://jsbin.com/ObUNuXU/1/edit
[16:30:48] <Matip> it's too fast, let me edit it, one sec
[16:31:10] <Matip> wait, it doesnt.. wtf?
[16:31:42] <BillCriswell> It's out to get you.
[16:31:55] <Matip> let me write my own example
[16:31:56] <sayd> any good carousel that react to mobile swipe?
[16:32:13] <BillCriswell> sayd: flexslider seems to be popular around these parts.
[16:32:57] <BillCriswell> sayd: I was always a fan of cycle, cycle2 supports it now.
[16:33:14] <BillCriswell> Not sure it's like... 1:1 but it does react.
[16:33:33] <mdev> $('#element').hide() how can I do that via ajax? I load ajax code into a popover bootstrap thing
[16:33:47] <mdev> now trying to close the window but don't know the element id
[16:34:05] <sayd> BillCriswell: thanks i will check them out
[16:35:52] <BillCriswell> sayd: http://www.slidesjs.com/ looks a little thinner than flexslider... Didn't actually compare them though haha.
[16:36:19] <BillCriswell> mdev: You can use something besides the element's Id.
[16:36:35] <BillCriswell> mdev: Do you want to do it to content loaded via ajax?
[16:37:19] <mdev> yes I have a button loaded via ajax, and I want to close the entire popover when I click the button
[16:37:31] <sayd> BillCriswell: I looked at that, but its a bit rigid in that you can't change the arrows out
[16:38:35] <Matip> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/DjyCn/
[16:38:45] <Matip> I found it's because of the padding and margin in fact
[16:38:46] <BillCriswell> sayd: It should be doable through CSS.
[16:38:53] <Matip> the animation changes these values
[16:38:59] <Matip> so it seems like it goes up
[16:39:26] <Matip> you see?
[16:39:40] <BillCriswell> Matip: Yes.
[16:40:07] <Matip> ok, that's the problem
[16:40:41] <Matip> I can add !important to its padding so it's not affected
[16:40:53] <Matip> but it's a little bit ugly :P
[16:41:33] <Technical_13> Can someone look at http://enwp.org/User:Technical_13/SandBox/help-helper-tools.js and help me figure out why it isn't triggering the .getJSON call?
[16:42:01] <BillCriswell> mdev: You can use event delegation, or you can apply the listener to hide it after the ajax call is complete.
[16:43:10] <BillCriswell> Matip: The padding isn't changing the top position, it's the margin.
[16:43:11] <mdev> no way to get parent and do $('#element').popover('hide')
[16:43:17] <mdev> #element being the parent whatever?
[16:43:32] <Matip> could be, I didn't check
[16:44:13] <BillCriswell> mdev: Hard time mapping out what's going on in my head.
[16:45:20] <BillCriswell> If you show me and example of what you have I should be able to help a bit more.
[16:48:34] <mdev> i'll just pass the id, is only way I can find
[16:51:26] <duckgoose> http://www.haxed.net/mac/
[16:51:38] <duckgoose> this is what you're suppose to use jQuery for right
[16:53:02] <BillCriswell> Haha, guess so?
[16:54:47] <BillCriswell> For a second I thought you had the command+tab coded out... but I'm an idiot.
[16:55:39] <duckgoose> far too lazy for that nonsense
[16:56:42] <BillCriswell> duckgoose: Yeah, I like to do things like this then just get super lazy at a random point.
[16:57:42] <BillCriswell> Now I kind of want to try this. =(
[16:59:15] <duckgoose> BillCriswell build a mock os 2/warp! :D
[16:59:37] <Velveeta> lol
[17:00:06] <Velveeta> i used to be entry level tech support for that… like almost 20 years ago :D
[17:00:16] <BillCriswell> Googling screen shots for it.
[17:00:27] <BillCriswell> Oh man this is... sexy.
[17:00:56] <BillCriswell> http://www.os2museum.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/winos2.gif this clock looks very sad
[17:01:19] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: How did that keg go?
[17:01:37] <Technical_13> Velveeta: can you look at my script and help me figure out why the .getJSON isn't working?
[17:01:44] <Technical_13> Can someone look at http://enwp.org/User:Technical_13/SandBox/help-helper-tools.js and help me figure out why it isn't triggering the .getJSON call?
[17:01:53] <Velveeta> so, there were around 30 of us or so, and we drank pretty heavily… i myself probably had close to a dozen pints (i brought my company-issued-and-branded pint glass) and we only killed half of it :D
[17:02:18] <Velveeta> so, poor me, i had to bring the other half home, it's sitting in my dining room right now, waiting for me to ice it down tomorrow for a nice day of football and bbq
[17:02:42] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[17:03:00] <none`> tamaguchi
[17:03:36] <Velveeta> oh yeah, but get this
[17:03:57] <Velveeta> so i'd placed my order for this thing last saturday, and told them it was for a company outing, and i needed it by friday at 11:30
[17:04:02] <Velveeta> "oh yeah we'll have it for sure"
[17:04:23] <Velveeta> so i'm running late, on my way to pick it up, and the assholes call me in mid-transit, i didn't even hear my phone because i had the music up loud
[17:04:35] <Velveeta> i get there and find the guy and he's like "oh, did you get my message? we didn't get your keg"
[17:04:50] <Velveeta> thanks for calling me *at* pickup time to let me know this, asshole
[17:05:11] <Velveeta> so i fell back to dos equis, which was probably better for being out in the sun like we were anyway
[17:05:22] <Velveeta> but that whole experience still left me pissed off
[17:05:32] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I'd be pretty bothered by that.
[17:06:37] <mdev> $('.popover').remove(); was all it took :/
[17:06:41] <mdev> spent hours on that, so annoying
[17:06:58] <Velveeta> you might want to try to scope that somehow, if you can
[17:07:03] <BillCriswell> Technical_13: Is the .getJSON actually not running or is assigning the return value not working like you expect?
[17:07:08] <Velveeta> like $(this).closest('.popover').remove() or something
[17:07:26] <Technical_13> BillCriswell: I don't think it's running
[17:07:44] <Technical_13> I'm not getting either of the log messages
[17:07:47] <BillCriswell> Technical_13: Take a look at the console and see if you see the request in the network tab.
[17:07:57] <Velveeta> i don't think he's assigning the return value in that statement either
[17:08:08] <Velveeta> he's actually returning $.getJSON.responseText
[17:08:13] <mdev> herm it works 2 times then fails on the third, tha's eird
[17:08:16] <Velveeta> and that doesn't exist as a property
[17:09:36] <Velveeta> does it execute your console.log statement for "Returning: " + pageText ?
[17:09:44] <Technical_13> Yes
[17:09:58] <Velveeta> what does it show for pageText?
[17:10:19] <Technical_13> [Object][object]
[17:11:38] <Velveeta> change that + to a comma
[17:11:45] <Velveeta> console.log("Returning: ", pageText);
[17:11:47] <Technical_13> I'm on a weak wifi... page loading slow to check BillCriswell question
[17:11:55] <Technical_13> Kk
[17:12:04] <Velveeta> it should output more data about that object instead of its toString representation
[17:17:29] <Technical_13> Commas replacing +
[17:17:33] <Technical_13> Trying..
[17:17:39] <mdev>  $(this).closest('.popover').remove()
[17:17:53] <mdev> works twice but on 3rd time always fails, no errors or anything shown
[17:17:59] <mdev> why would it fail on the third time?
[17:18:01] <Technical_13> mdev: what is this ?
[17:18:07] <Velveeta> not sure
[17:18:16] <Velveeta> technical: he's probably talking about something i recommended to him
[17:18:23] <mdev> I am
[17:18:25] <Velveeta> to scope his popover removal instead of just removing all in the document
[17:18:46] <Velveeta> because if there are any other popovers for any given reason, it'll remove them too, unintentionally
[17:19:05] <Technical_13> Velveeta: returning undefined now instead of [object][object]
[17:19:46] <Technical_13> Bill I see it poking the net, but it's not poking the url I specified for the api.
[17:20:36] <Technical_13> And it does it ~200ms after I get the return
[17:22:08] <Matip> wow, jqueries' animations are pretty slow in smartphones
[17:24:03] <Technical_13> I'm going to clean out som stuff some other tried to help and don't make sense/work..
[17:24:21] <BillCriswell> Matip: You could only use them as a fallback.
[17:24:46] <Matip> I should be using CSS's animations instead?
[17:26:20] <BillCriswell> Matip: I would use them if they were available.
[17:26:54] <Matip> you can't scroll using CSS I think
[17:27:00] <BillCriswell> Matip: http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/ might help?
[17:27:14] <BillCriswell> Not that I'm aware of Matip.
[17:29:01] <Matip> jquery.transit doesn't have .slideUp either :P
[17:29:56] <BillCriswell> All slide up really does is change the height.
[17:30:16] <BillCriswell> then hide it... Might even change opacity.
[17:30:19] <Matip> not just that, it applies a display:none at the end I believe
[17:30:27] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[17:30:42] <Matip> you can't do that just with css
[17:30:59] <Velveeta> ok back, let me see what i missed
[17:31:12] <Technical_13> Okay.  Made a pretty substantial change.
[17:31:15] <grafi> you know nothing jon snow
[17:31:25] <Technical_13> Testing to see what I get back from it.
[17:31:44] <Velveeta> ok, so undefined is exactly what i expected to see you get back
[17:32:03] <Velveeta> because responseText isn't a property of the getJSON promise object
[17:32:31] <Velveeta> how about in place of that responseText, you put .always(function () { console.log('finished'); });
[17:33:00] <Technical_13> Take another look at it.. I just cleaned a bunch stuff that others tried.
[17:33:50] <Technical_13> Might I be better switching getJSON back to .ajax?
[17:34:36] <Velveeta> i prefer to always use $.ajax just for customization options and control, but let me take a look
[17:35:52] <DaniG2k> oh my god
[17:36:03] <DaniG2k> hottest girls ive ever seen in my life at the club tonight -_-
[17:36:08] <grafi> ...
[17:36:11] <DaniG2k> yeah
[17:36:14] <DaniG2k> thats what i thought too
[17:36:24] <DaniG2k> oh yeah
[17:36:31] <DaniG2k> and i have a jquery question as well :P
[17:36:34] <Velveeta> club? like, in.. the outside?
[17:36:38] <DaniG2k> hahahah
[17:36:40] * Velveeta cowers in a corner!
[17:36:42] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: yes
[17:36:42] <grafi> wheres that
[17:36:44] <BillCriswell> Matip: http://jsbin.com/omeWIna/1/edit This isn't close enough?
[17:36:48] <grafi> can i take my laptop?
[17:36:51] <Technical_13> DaniG2k: girls?
[17:36:54] <DaniG2k> haahahaha
[17:37:10] <DaniG2k> i spoke to this smoking hot asian girl
[17:37:14] <DaniG2k> jesus
[17:37:17] <DaniG2k> but then i left
[17:37:21] <DaniG2k> because clubs suck
[17:37:23] <DaniG2k> oh well
[17:37:27] <DaniG2k> onto the jquery question
[17:37:28] <grafi> but you forgot your tentacle suit
[17:37:31] <Velveeta> i was just telling a coworker of mine the other day that asian girls don't have cooties
[17:37:32] <grafi> gotcha
[17:37:38] <Velveeta> lol @ tentacle suit
[17:37:59] * Technical_13 prefers women to girls.
[17:38:11] <Velveeta> technical: i can't see anything wrong with that getjson call, and you're calling getPageText right?
[17:38:18] <DaniG2k> sooooooo
[17:38:29] <Technical_13> Yeah.
[17:38:40] <Velveeta> dani: bring it on
[17:38:49] <Technical_13> I just made some adjustments I think might help.
[17:38:53] <DaniG2k> this coffeescript/jquery shizniz is supposed to add/remove a field (but there has to be at least one and at most 5)
[17:38:56] <DaniG2k> https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/6567047
[17:38:59] <Velveeta> technical: if you add that .always to your getjson call, does it output anything?
[17:39:11] <DaniG2k> i can add and remove just fine if I take out the if conditions
[17:39:16] <Technical_13> I'll try that after I test this.
[17:39:18] <Technical_13> :)
[17:39:21] <DaniG2k> but it doesnt let me click if the if conditions are there
[17:39:32] <Technical_13> Ha!
[17:39:42] <Technical_13> My test did something!
[17:39:51] <Technical_13> I now get failed error!
[17:39:58] <Velveeta> change size to length or size()
[17:40:23] <Technical_13> And I know why.. I missed an / in the url
[17:40:37] <Velveeta> technical: ahhhhh no wonder it looked fine syntactically :D
[17:40:38] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: still nothing :(
[17:41:01] <Velveeta> dani: try outputting that condition in a console.log
[17:41:21] <Velveeta> and if it outputs false, output it without a comparison, just the item it's trying to compare
[17:41:31] <Velveeta> make sure it's not undefined or function or something
[17:42:01] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: sorry the n00b question but how do i output it to console?
[17:42:34] <Velveeta> wrap it in console.log, so like console.log($(@).siblings('fieldset').size);
[17:42:38] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: ah never mind I just wrapped it in a console.log
[17:42:40] <DaniG2k> right
[17:42:41] <DaniG2k> thanks
[17:42:43] <Velveeta> no problem
[17:42:54] <Technical_13> Hrmm
[17:43:19] <Technical_13> Now I'm getting pageCurrText.replace is not a function.
[17:43:34] <Matip> bigLanky, haha, it looks like it's sliding up, yeah :P
[17:43:47] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: ah i see, it says
[17:43:54] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'length' of object [object Object] is not a function
[17:44:14] <Velveeta> that's weird
[17:44:27] <Velveeta> even if it found no field set siblings it should have returned an empty jquery collection to chain off of
[17:44:29] <BillCriswell> Are you doing .length or .length() ?
[17:45:07] <DaniG2k> I was doing length()
[17:45:11] <DaniG2k> now I'm doing length
[17:45:18] <Velveeta> yeah length is just a property, not function
[17:45:25] <DaniG2k> but it stops working if I put it in an if condition
[17:45:35] <DaniG2k> if $(@).siblings('fieldset').length > 1
[17:45:53] <DaniG2k> (I only want to remove if there's at least 1 field present)
[17:45:56] <Velveeta> console.log($(@).siblings('fieldset').length > 1)
[17:46:35] <DaniG2k> always returns false
[17:46:49] <Velveeta> log it without the > 1 part
[17:47:10] <DaniG2k> always returns 0 -_- fml
[17:47:23] <DaniG2k> first i get no girls at the club
[17:47:29] <DaniG2k> not jquery doesnt behave
[17:47:33] <DaniG2k> ...fml
[17:47:39] <DaniG2k> *now
[17:47:45] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Sure you want siblings?
[17:47:49] <Velveeta> $(DaniG2k).find('girls').length
[17:47:53] <DaniG2k> hahahaha
[17:48:02] <Velveeta> Bill: I'm just going off what his current check was
[17:48:11] <DaniG2k> $(DaniG2k).length
[17:48:13] <Velveeta> so my next question was console.log($(@));
[17:48:31] <Velveeta> is that node at the same dom level as the field sets your looking for?
[17:49:00] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: It's kind of disturbing he's considering his children and grand children.
[17:49:31] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: its returning a long ass dictionary
[17:49:41] <DaniG2k> [a.remove_fields, context: a.remove_fields, jquery: "1.10.2", constructor: function, init: function, selector: ""…]
[17:50:09] <Velveeta> so it looks like it's returning a.remove_fields
[17:50:18] <Velveeta> is that a sibling of your fieldsets?
[17:50:53] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: the remove field link is _within_ the fieldset
[17:51:17] <Velveeta> try making your if statement something like this:
[17:51:47] <Velveeta> if $(@).closest('field set').siblings('fieldset').length > 1
[17:53:33] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: still doesnt work
[17:53:48] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: its not removing the fieldset at all
[17:54:08] <Velveeta> is there somewhere we can see this in action?
[17:54:38] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: The question I'm always thinking.
[17:54:45] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: hmm im afraid not unless you want to clone my rails app
[17:54:48] <Velveeta> if not, then if you can console.log($(@).closest('fieldset').siblings('fieldset').length
[17:54:58] <JimmyXander> Damn Velveeta always messing up the code
[17:54:58] <Velveeta> )
[17:55:03] <Velveeta> add a parens on the end of that
[17:55:06] <sammich> $('.Sidney').find('Nemo')?
[17:55:20] <Velveeta> jimmy: i can't help it, these fingers are registered weapons, i destroy any code i touch
[17:55:30] <JimmyXander> inorit
[17:56:04] <sammich> BOOM! Segfault.
[17:56:18] <JimmyXander> yo sammich how you been foo?
[17:56:45] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: ok thats returning numbers
[17:56:48] <Velveeta> "BOOM! Segfault" sounds like a geekier equivalent of BOOM! Headshot! :D
[17:56:57] <Velveeta> dani: what numbers?
[17:57:11] <JimmyXander> XD
[17:57:15] <DaniG2k> well i added a bunch of fields and removed some random ones. i got 0, 2, 4, 7
[17:57:30] <sammich> JimmyXander: been being
[17:57:37] <Velveeta> ok, so it sounds like it's counting those fieldset siblings at least
[17:57:44] <sammich> Velveeta: except you're headshotting yourself
[17:57:46] <Velveeta> at least i'm assuming so based on the fact that those numbers changed
[17:57:46] <JimmyXander> sammich: right on
[17:57:52] <Technical_13> Wow.
[17:58:03] <Technical_13> That makes for an intersting log.
[17:58:20] <Technical_13> Velveeta: I'm going to pastebin the log.
[17:58:23] <Velveeta> sammich: in my defense, i did call a hotline before i segfaulted… that's them dropping the ball
[17:58:28] <Velveeta> technical: sounds good
[17:58:35] <Technical_13> I think you can figure it out based on it.
[17:58:46] <sammich> wait on
[17:59:03] <sammich> is segfaulting, like falling off your segway, or a warranty issue?
[17:59:32] <Velveeta> good question
[17:59:37] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: its not working well
[17:59:44] <Velveeta> right!
[17:59:46] <DaniG2k> -_-
[17:59:56] <Technical_13> lol
[18:00:03] <DaniG2k> it prevents me from removing the last field only the first time
[18:00:13] <DaniG2k> then if i add some fields and try removing, it lets me
[18:00:21] <DaniG2k> I think it's because the length has been incremented by then
[18:00:28] <DaniG2k> it keeps incrementing
[18:00:34] <sammich> I'm off to watch a riddickulous movie
[18:00:42] <Velveeta> that length is evaluated at the time it hits that line
[18:00:55] <Velveeta> so it wouldn't be holding any cached value or anything
[18:01:02] <Velveeta> sammich: which one?
[18:01:14] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: yea but as in the numbers I showed you its only taking into account the last fieldset I've added
[18:01:21] <Velveeta> i believe that movie is called "fuck you i'm out"
[18:01:31] <Velveeta> dani: ahhh gotcha
[18:01:46] <Velveeta> so are all of these field sets at the same dom level? or do you have them in separate containers or something?
[18:01:48] <sammich> do you have to ask?
[18:02:02] <Velveeta> ohhhh i see what you did there now
[18:02:04] * Velveeta smacks himself.
[18:02:05] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: they are all in <fieldset> tags on the same page
[18:02:09] <Technical_13> Not lettinf me copy... I hate it when it does that...
[18:02:12] <Velveeta> let me know how it is, because i'm wanting to see that one too
[18:02:13] <sammich> now I can leave
[18:02:28] <sammich> alright, you'll have to remind me
[18:02:33] <Velveeta> dani: same page, yes, but same dom level or separate containers? because siblings will only search the current dom level
[18:02:37] <sammich> to tell you..
[18:02:40] <Technical_13> So... ima screenshot it
[18:02:50] <Velveeta> ok, bill, remind me to remind sammich to tell me
[18:02:58] <JimmyXander> Success is when your app/plugin works properly and returns 42 to the console even though you don't know why.
[18:03:00] <JimmyXander> =)
[18:05:13] <DaniG2k> so the length of $(@).siblings('fieldset') is always 0 it seems
[18:05:30] <Velveeta> right
[18:05:39] <Velveeta> because you said a.remove_whatever was a child of the fieldset
[18:05:44] <DaniG2k> yes
[18:05:45] <Velveeta> so it has no siblings that are fieldsets
[18:05:53] <DaniG2k> right
[18:06:00] <Velveeta> you have to go up the dom tree to a field set first, and then check its siblings
[18:06:17] <Velveeta> hence the $(@).closest('fieldset').siblings('fieldset')
[18:06:46] <DaniG2k> right
[18:07:05] <Velveeta> but you said that wasn't returning a proper number, only the siblings of that current fieldset
[18:07:06] <DaniG2k> ok
[18:07:13] <DaniG2k> im logging it
[18:07:14] <Velveeta> so that leads me to believe that you have field sets in other containers
[18:07:16] <DaniG2k> now its returning numbers
[18:08:24] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: got it
[18:08:27] <DaniG2k> its working now
[18:08:31] <Velveeta> sweet :)
[18:08:33] <DaniG2k> phew that took longer than expected :)
[18:08:34] <DaniG2k> thanks!
[18:08:40] <Velveeta> now go get some girls!
[18:08:45] <DaniG2k> mann
[18:08:47] <DaniG2k> i wish
[18:10:00] <Velveeta> at some point, i need to try to wrap up my own release commitments
[18:11:51] <Technical_13> Velveeta: http://imageshack.us/a/img833/6913/parn.png
[18:12:50] <Technical_13> Looks like it's trying to return before it finishes retrieving.
[18:13:27] <Velveeta> right, because it's an asynchronous request
[18:13:41] <Velveeta> it'll fire off that request and then just keep processing js like nothing happened
[18:13:49] <Velveeta> so let me take another look at the code
[18:14:03] <Technical_13> How do I make it wait?
[18:14:18] <Technical_13> Async: false ?
[18:14:29] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: its not working for the add field either -_-
[18:14:33] <DaniG2k> the same exact code
[18:14:35] <DaniG2k> wtf
[18:14:56] <Velveeta> async: false has been deprecated
[18:14:58] <DaniG2k> im trying to log $(@).closest('fieldset').siblings('fieldset') but its always length 0
[18:15:06] <Velveeta> you need to treat it as asynchronous and write your code around that
[18:15:23] <Velveeta> so, first of all, you're not initializing a pageCurrText  variable anywhere
[18:15:36] <Velveeta> i see plenty of functions that are commented out that look like they create it
[18:15:47] <Velveeta> but your current non-commented code doesn't create it, just tries to dereference it
[18:16:09] <DaniG2k> u talking to me?
[18:16:17] <Velveeta> that was meant for technical_13
[18:16:20] <DaniG2k> ah
[18:16:27] <Velveeta> for you i say start by console.log'ing each step of that chain
[18:16:40] <Velveeta> $(@).closest('fieldset')
[18:16:42] <Velveeta> and $(@)
[18:16:45] <JimmyXander> man, breaking up with your girlfriend is really hard to do
[18:17:01] <JimmyXander> specially when she knows the code to your apartment door..
[18:17:09] <Technical_13> function tagWorkibg creates it.
[18:17:24] <BillCriswell> Damn..  I wish I had a code to my door.
[18:17:27] <BillCriswell> I hate keys.
[18:17:28] <Velveeta> oh now i see, had to refresh
[18:17:32] <Velveeta> ok let me re-evaluate this now
[18:17:36] <Technical_13> I could globalize that though and not have to do it in each.
[18:17:50] <JimmyXander> BillCriswell: its pretty nice
[18:18:01] <JimmyXander> till like everyone knows your code and you have to change it
[18:18:03] <JimmyXander> and then you forget
[18:18:21] <JimmyXander> and get locked out of your apartment because you couldn't remember your fucking code
[18:18:25] <BillCriswell> I forgot my ATM PIN number for 2 days once... still can't explain that brain fart.
[18:18:27] <Velveeta> ok, so to restructure tagWorking to use the deferred object returned by the getJSON call
[18:18:33] <Velveeta> you want to do something more like this:
[18:18:37] <JimmyXander> been there brother
[18:18:55] <Velveeta> getPageText().done(function (pageCurrText) { … });
[18:19:26] <Velveeta> inside that function you pass to .done() you'll receive the same parameter as you would in your success option that you're passing to that getJSON call, the response itself
[18:19:33] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: It's been like 6 years, but I still fear it'll happen again.
[18:19:33] <Velveeta> and it will fire that once the call completes
[18:19:45] <JimmyXander> XD it was two weeks ago for me
[18:19:50] <JimmyXander> I have terrible memory
[18:20:13] <Technical_13> Let me see if I understand and you can check it. :)
[18:20:59] <Velveeta> that's why you need a nice simple pin number, like take the month of your birthday and the date of your birthday (example: 10/24) and go 10log24, then take *that* value and square root it, then grab the first 4 decimal places and bam, pin number
[18:21:02] <Velveeta> super simple
[18:21:05] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: Mine is probably bad as well, but I'm stubborn about it. Girlfriend says I forget everything she says, I know I forget somethings but I swear she makes up half the shit.
[18:21:30] <Velveeta> bill: i had that problem with my ex-wife, but she would literally have arguments with me inside her head sometimes
[18:21:33] <JimmyXander> you remembered she said that
[18:21:44] <Velveeta> so when she said i forgot something, i'd be like "are you sure you didn't just tell me that in your head at some point?"
[18:21:47] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha. Been there as well.
[18:22:12] <JimmyXander> for realz yo
[18:22:47] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: True! But, if I didn't quote her 100% she also says I wasn't listening, so it's tough.
[18:22:50] <Technical_13> Okay.  That what you meant Velveeta?
[18:23:05] * Velveeta claps
[18:23:07] <Velveeta> beautiful, sir
[18:23:15] <Velveeta> at least i'm assuming you're a sir
[18:23:19] <JimmyXander> true
[18:23:19] <Velveeta> yes, that's what i'm talking about
[18:23:25] <Technical_13> Ha
[18:23:32] <Technical_13> Assumptions...
[18:23:39] <Velveeta> i know i know, ass out of me and umptions
[18:23:47] <Technical_13> I'm a warforged.
[18:23:57] <Velveeta> a warfrog?
[18:24:08] <Velveeta> is that like battle toads?
[18:24:33] <Technical_13> http://ddowiki.com/page/Warforged
[18:25:26] <Velveeta> fancy
[18:25:52] <Velveeta> my fantasy football team is called +99 saves vs fumbles
[18:26:19] <JimmyXander> Oh are we role playing? I wanna be a Bard
[18:26:42] <Velveeta> i wanna cast magic missile….. i'm attacking the darkness!
[18:27:09] <Velveeta> for reference, if you're not familiar already: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zng5kRle4FA
[18:27:19] * JimmyXander rolls a 20
[18:27:40] <Velveeta> i have one of the greatest shirts for that
[18:28:11] <Velveeta> this one: http://shirt.woot.com/derby/entry/58825/critical-hit
[18:29:33] <Technical_13> Velveeta: you play DDO?
[18:29:38] <Velveeta> nopers
[18:29:41] <Technical_13> Or pnp?
[18:29:55] <BillCriswell> Sucks the dinosaurs died.
[18:29:58] <Velveeta> i used to do mud development though, that's how i got most of my beginning programming skills in general
[18:30:12] <JimmyXander> Velveeta: I hate you for taking that 2.5 minutes of my life away from me
[18:30:23] <Velveeta> lol
[18:30:42] <JimmyXander> funny though
[18:30:52] <Velveeta> here's one of my other favorite dinosaur shirts to own: http://shirt.woot.com/offers/divided-by-zero
[18:30:53] <JimmyXander> I miss highschool
[18:31:03] <JimmyXander> XD
[18:31:06] * Velveeta chuckles and says "they're all dead now"
[18:31:09] <Technical_13> Now I'm just getting failure...
[18:31:19] <Technical_13> Might be the wifi though.
[18:31:54] <ggdevelop> I am trying to make some items hidden when I print by visibility : hidden, but the printout have these items printed anyway
[18:32:06] <Technical_13> Stil not returning...
[18:32:09] <BillCriswell> I still hate the idea of homework as much as I did in high school, so I don't miss it.
[18:32:39] <BillCriswell> I didn't mind going to school, tests, teachers, really anything besides homework.
[18:33:08] <Velveeta> oh yeah, technical, since you switched your getjson call to $.ajax instead, try adding a parameter for dataType: 'json'
[18:33:30] <Technical_13> Still telling me pageCurrText.replace is not a function.
[18:33:33] <Technical_13> Ojay.
[18:33:44] <BillCriswell> Damn eye still won't stop twitching.
[18:34:22] <Velveeta> bill: i hate that crap
[18:34:40] <Velveeta> technical: oh, and also, when you do that, you'll probably still get that error
[18:34:46] <Velveeta> because it's going to be returning a json object
[18:34:47] <Technical_13> Velveeta: I usually do jsonp insteas.  Does it mattee?
[18:34:59] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: It's been since Thursday basically.
[18:35:20] <Velveeta> how about instead of trying to do a .replace on the response, just console.log it first and see what you're getting back
[18:35:37] <Technical_13> Well, I have &format=json in the api url.
[18:36:06] <Technical_13> I think there is a console.log right above it.
[18:36:11] <Technical_13> Lemme check.
[18:36:12] <Velveeta> technical: if this is a cross domain request, you'll need to use jsonp for your dataType, if it's same domain, you can just use json
[18:36:56] <Velveeta> and even if you have format=json in the parameters, jquery will return it as a string if you don't specify a json dataType, i believe it assumes html as the response type if you don't specify otherwise, which means it'll return it as consumable html == a string
[18:37:03] <Technical_13> Ahh same domain
[18:38:22] <BillCriswell> Snickers Ice Cream bar sounds awesome right now.
[18:38:28] <Velveeta> sure does
[18:38:45] <Velveeta> i have neither snickers nor ice cream bar...
[18:38:58] <Velveeta> just a glass of whiskey and a beer
[18:39:18] <Technical_13> pageCurrText is [object Object] just before the .replace
[18:39:36] <Velveeta> ok so that makes sense if we're returning a json response
[18:39:59] <Velveeta> your console.log doesn't show the actual object makeup? it always just says [object Object] ?
[18:40:02] <Technical_13> Lets try it with dataType defined
[18:40:06] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I think a Wawa trip is in my future.
[18:40:07] <Technical_13> Yep
[18:40:23] <Velveeta> i smell pennsylvania
[18:40:34] <JimmyXander> #justvent
[18:40:54] <BillCriswell> Heck yes.
[18:42:18] <Technical_13> ReferenceError: json is not defined?
[18:42:26] <Velveeta> technical: if you can't get it to output the object data (aside from its toString representation) you may need to set a breakpoint so you can inspect that object
[18:42:31] <Velveeta> json should be a string: 'json'
[18:42:59] <Technical_13> Ahh.  I'm getting tired.
[18:43:16] <Velveeta> drink more, it's a stimulant, i swear…
[18:44:04] * Technical_13 doesn't drink.
[18:44:10] <Technical_13> Much.
[18:44:15] <Technical_13> Anymore
[18:44:17] <Technical_13> ...
[18:44:18] <Velveeta> you should start, it's good for you, i swear
[18:44:25] <BillCriswell> 3 good beers make my brain work like a normal persons, it's nice.
[18:44:36] <Velveeta> not only is it a healthy lifestyle option, but it makes you a role model
[18:44:49] <Technical_13> I'm glad you said good beers.
[18:44:54] <Velveeta> so am i
[18:44:57] <Technical_13> Most people drink crap.
[18:45:00] <Velveeta> but now i'm curious as to your definition :D
[18:45:17] <Velveeta> my best friend drinks nothing but coors light, even if i'm buying… it's all he has any interest in drinking
[18:45:41] <BillCriswell> I need like... 3 over 8%
[18:45:42] <Technical_13> He's most people.
[18:45:50] <Velveeta> right
[18:46:02] <Velveeta> over 8% huh, now you're getting up there
[18:46:07] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: When I go to the bar with my dad he puts back coors light all night.
[18:46:15] <Technical_13> I prefer a good lager or porter or stout..
[18:46:16] <Velveeta> how about this question: hops vs malt?
[18:46:27] <BillCriswell> I'm an IPA guy.
[18:46:30] <Velveeta> technical: now you're speaking my language, but i can't go too heavy into stouts
[18:46:31] <BillCriswell> hops all day.
[18:46:38] <Velveeta> i can't do IPA's, malt is where it's at :D
[18:46:54] <Velveeta> i love a good brown ale or porter, but my favorites are the oktoberfests, so this is my favorite time of year
[18:47:03] <Velveeta> plus, i love halloween, so there's that too
[18:47:20] <Velveeta> bill: re: your dad, that's because he has to in order to even get a buzz :D
[18:47:27] <Technical_13> Pumkinhead is good too.
[18:47:28] <Velveeta> you pee that stuff out faster than it takes root
[18:47:38] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Indeed.
[18:47:52] <Velveeta> i think i mentioned this in here the other day, maybe not, but blue moon makes a fantastic pumpkin ale as their offering for this time of year
[18:47:57] <JimmyXander> I like tater tots
[18:47:59] <JimmyXander> =D
[18:48:07] <Technical_13> Now I'm getting getPageText(...) is undefined.
[18:48:13] <BillCriswell> If you don't like tater tots you're probably an asshole.
[18:48:20] <Velveeta> but right now i have st arnold, leinenkugel, sam adams, and shiner oktoberfests in my beer fridge waiting for me to get to them
[18:48:24] <JimmyXander> BillCriswell: True story
[18:48:26] <Velveeta> bill: that goes without saying
[18:48:28] <Technical_13> JimmyXander: you still like your mommy's boobie.
[18:48:42] <Technical_13> :0
[18:48:44] <Velveeta> technical: did you botch something somewhere?
[18:48:47] <JimmyXander> Technical_13: No, that was our mom in the picture
[18:49:04] <Technical_13> Our mom? We're sisters?
[18:49:07] <JimmyXander> Yup
[18:49:11] <Technical_13> xD
[18:49:23] <Velveeta> so technical *is* female?
[18:49:29] <Technical_13> Not as far as I can tel Velveeta
[18:49:33] <Technical_13> Ans no
[18:49:45] <Velveeta> too late, you already put that impression in my head… how YOU doin
[18:49:49] <JimmyXander> Sisters in spirit I guess
[18:49:55] * Technical_13 needs to pee then sleep.
[18:50:09] <Velveeta> is your latest stuff up on that wiki page?
[18:50:30] <Technical_13> Yes
[18:50:46] <JimmyXander> dun dun DUN!
[18:50:58] <Velveeta> oh, you're not returning the deferred object from $.ajax in getPageText
[18:51:12] <JimmyXander> Why are you people talking smarter than me
[18:51:17] <Velveeta> you don't need your pageText variable at all in that function btw, you can just return $.ajax(options … )
[18:51:18] <JimmyXander> big words confuse me
[18:51:29] <JimmyXander> I'm still wrapping my head around arrays and for loops
[18:51:47] <Velveeta> jimmy: check out my blog, i go into a lot of js fundamentals that people tend to skip over these days
[18:51:51] <Velveeta> http://conqueringtheclient.com/
[18:52:09] <JimmyXander> I skipped all of js and went straight to jquery
[18:52:19] <JimmyXander> I couldn't code something in pure javascript if I wanted to
[18:52:33] <Velveeta> i feel like the barrier to entry is so low these days with a lot of these maturing libraries and frameworks, that it's easy for people to jump right in and learn *these libraries and frameworks* without learning how javascript itself actually works
[18:52:36] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: I accidentally learned javascript through jQuery haha.
[18:52:36] * JimmyXander is a sad sack of shit
[18:52:47] <Velveeta> see? cases in point :D
[18:53:03] <JimmyXander> that's okay though
[18:53:09] <Velveeta> once you understand the underlying rules, it's a lot easier to understand why libraries/frameworks actually work, and how you can exploit them further
[18:53:22] <JimmyXander> I get that
[18:53:42] <JimmyXander> but jQuery does a lot of the stuff I would want to do in js anyway and it makes it easy.
[18:53:49] <JimmyXander> even if it does come with some overhea
[18:53:52] <JimmyXander> d*
[18:53:55] <Velveeta> right, jquery does a lot of abstraction at the browser-quirk level
[18:54:17] <JimmyXander> like css selectors
[18:54:19] <Velveeta> giving you a single interface to develop to without having to worry about things like: do i need to use attachEventListener or addEventListener? etc
[18:54:19] <JimmyXander> that sweet
[18:54:28] <Velveeta> and yes, its dom parsing/manipulation stuff
[18:54:36] <JimmyXander> and the ajax
[18:54:52] <JimmyXander> it could do without some of the animation stuff
[18:54:57] <JimmyXander> =/
[18:54:59] <Velveeta> but jquery doesn't define whether you should use things like object instances vs prototypes, or self-executing functions, or things like that which fall through to javascript fundamentals
[18:56:01] <Prose> I've got a super newb question I was wondering if anyonne could answer for me?
[18:56:16] <Velveeta> yes! phew, that was an easy one :D
[18:56:28] <JimmyXander> for example, 6 anonymous functions one inside another to chain a set of actions together to happen in order. Even as a newb I can tell that doesn't look right. but it gets the job done
[18:56:56] <Velveeta> jimmy: jquery now offers promise functions for all of its animations to get around that callback hell
[18:56:57] <JimmyXander> Was that even a question?
[18:57:21] <JimmyXander> Velveeta: no idea what you just said there bro
[18:57:34] <Velveeta> so now you could do something like this: $(this).fadeIn().then().slideUp().promise().then().etc()
[18:57:46] <JimmyXander> Prose: that ended in a "?" but it was a statement
[18:57:51] <Prose> hahah
[18:57:53] <Velveeta> you might even be able to omit the .promise() calls in favor of just using .then(), as .then() returns a new promise object itself
[18:57:55] <Prose> ok!
[18:58:09] <JimmyXander> FOR REAL!?!?!?!?!?!
[18:58:24] <Prose> I've got an form that uses AJAX to submit the contents and then I reload the <div> that contains the form + some of the output
[18:58:25] <Velveeta> thanks to julian aubourg for teaching me that about the .then() function this past week :D
[18:58:32] <Prose> the first time I submit, everything works great
[18:58:34] <Prose> the data goes in
[18:58:39] <Prose> the div refreshes
[18:58:53] <Velveeta> data goes in, data goes out, you can't explain that
[18:58:57] <Prose> but when I type in some new content and hit submit again, the second time it actually attempts to submit the form
[18:58:59] <Prose> lol Velveeta
[18:59:04] <JimmyXander> can I do like $(this).fadeIn().then()$.(that).fadeOut.then()$(this span).$slideUp() ?
[18:59:19] <Velveeta> prose: does it redraw the form as part of that success function that refreshes the div?
[18:59:25] <Technical_13> !this
[18:59:25] <b-ot> Technical_13: a real bug http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/16523
[18:59:32] <Prose> yes the form is redrawn
[18:59:59] <Velveeta> including the form tag itself? the actual form element wrapper?
[18:59:59] <BillCriswell> JimmyXander: would need .then(function(){ $(that){ shit }) I imagine?
[19:00:09] <Velveeta> bill: point!
[19:00:25] <Prose> yes... the <div> that refreshes contains the form, and some other objects
[19:00:28] <Technical_13> !$(this)
[19:00:40] <BillCriswell> Prose: Event delegation sir.
[19:00:48] <shoky> you can't omit the .promise() and you can't chain more animations to a promise
[19:00:51] <Velveeta> prose: then that's the problem, the form you originally bound the submit listener to has been destroyed by the redrawing of contents
[19:01:05] <Prose> ahhhh ok i THOUGHT so
[19:01:05] <JimmyXander> BillCriswell: but at that point you don't need the .then you can just do $(this).fadeIn(function(){ $(that).slideDown() });
[19:01:07] <Velveeta> prose: you'll have to rebind your submit listener to the new form element
[19:01:14] <Prose> interesting
[19:01:23] <Prose> im soooooper new to jQuery etc
[19:01:29] <JimmyXander> Prose: me too
[19:01:30] <JimmyXander> =)
[19:01:33] <Prose> nice nice!
[19:01:41] <Velveeta> sorry shaky, thanks for keeping me honest there
[19:01:54] <Prose> ok so would it just be better to keep the form outside of the div and then use jQuery to clear the form contents?
[19:02:01] <Velveeta> you *can* get a promise from an animation function, but you can't directly chain into another animation
[19:02:06] <JimmyXander> Prose: So be careful. I'm the king of askin the dumb question. Don't tread on my turf...
[19:02:09] <Velveeta> you can use a method like this though: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10370298/how-do-i-animate-in-jquery-without-stacking-callbacks
[19:02:44] <Velveeta> prose: yes, if it's not gonna jack your layout to move the form outside of the div, and just redraw the div while leaving the form element intact, that would be better
[19:02:46] <BillCriswell> Prose: That, or do $('.parent-that-doesnt-get-updated').on('submit', 'form', function(){ ... }); owooo!
[19:02:59] <shoky> tho using $.Animation you can get more flexibility than with just .promise()
[19:03:07] <Prose> ahhhhh i like this IRC channel yes I do!
[19:03:14] <JimmyXander> Velveeta: that uses deferred objects, they scare me. I tried to read about them and the words were too big
[19:03:24] <shoky> e.g.  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bAgCu/1/
[19:03:33] <Velveeta> jimmy: i'll be posting an article on deferred sorcery in the next week or so
[19:03:44] <Velveeta> i'll just repurpose one that i wrote for our internal company blog
[19:03:51] <JimmyXander> Velveeta: NO THEY SCARE ME DON'T DO IT! NOOOO!
[19:03:59] <Technical_13> Velveeta: do I need the return in there that was returning undefined?
[19:04:00] <Velveeta> once you wrap your head around them, they're super powerful
[19:04:08] <BillCriswell> I needs wawa.
[19:04:08] <Prose> hey Bill: care to explain that a tiny bit more..?
[19:04:18] <Technical_13> I cut it out thinking it was nothing.
[19:04:43] <Velveeta> technical: just add return right before your $.ajax in getPageText(), so "return $.ajax(..."
[19:04:57] <Velveeta> that will return $.ajax's deferred object
[19:05:09] <Technical_13> Ahhh
[19:05:25] <Velveeta> and that's what you need to chain your .done function off of within tagWorking
[19:05:47] <BillCriswell> Prose: It's event delegation. Events bubble up. You can do like... $('body').on('submit', 'form', function(){ /* This will run even if a form is created dynamically */ });
[19:06:11] <Prose> oh very interesting.
[19:06:18] <BillCriswell> That waits for the submit event to bubble up to <body>, checks to see if it's a <form> then does some shit.
[19:06:19] <Velveeta> good call bill
[19:06:23] <BillCriswell> Well, calls the callback.
[19:06:29] <JimmyXander> omg the big words are going to make my head asp lode!
[19:06:30] <Velveeta> well, that's sort of right
[19:06:42] <Velveeta> in older versions of jquery it did actually wait for the event to bubble all the way up
[19:07:05] <Velveeta> i think in current versions it will actually check at each dom level "do we have a higher delegated event listener for this element? if so, fire it now"
[19:07:07] <BillCriswell> check to see if it's a form that triggered the event *
[19:07:27] <Velveeta> that way you can do things like delegate at the body level for an anchor click, and actually have it work instead of navigate away
[19:07:48] <Prose> ok that's pretty damn interesting.
[19:07:49] <Velveeta> because an anchor will execute its default as soon as it's leaving its own dom level, so it doesn't let that event bubble up fast enough
[19:07:53] <BillCriswell> It's sorcery.
[19:07:56] <Velveeta> indeed it is
[19:07:59] <BillCriswell> Ok, I need ice cream.
[19:08:02] <Prose> haha
[19:08:05] <Velveeta> go get your wawa on
[19:08:08] <Prose> mmmhm
[19:08:22] <shoky> check at each dom level? sounds very inefficient
[19:08:45] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure that's correct, but it loops through its internal cache object as opposed to parsing the dom
[19:08:50] <Velveeta> so it's still fairly snappy
[19:09:01] <shoky> don't see what parsing the dom has to do with it
[19:09:25] <Velveeta> as in it doesn't have to say "for all parents of this element, do we have a listener attached that references this tag"
[19:09:34] <Velveeta> and parse the dom to find all of those parents
[19:09:42] <shoky> why would it have to say that
[19:10:01] <shoky> well maybe for special events that aren't bubbled by the browser
[19:10:04] <Velveeta> in order to search out the rest of the dom for delegated listeners, to fire at the lower level element's dom level
[19:10:13] <Velveeta> at the time that it's evaluating those elements
[19:10:19] <Velveeta> instead of waiting for it to bubble up
[19:10:39] <shoky> but who said there's any other listener?
[19:10:44] <Technical_13> Velveeta: http://pastebin.com/mN9yni7R
[19:10:51] <Velveeta> so it got around problems like what i mentioned with anchors, as well as something like, a td listener that was bound at the body level, and had a click event killed at the table level, before it could finish bubbling
[19:11:07] <Velveeta> shoky: nothing says there's any other listener, but jquery checks for it, for delegation purposes
[19:11:13] <shoky> checks for it, when?
[19:11:23] <shoky> $('body').on('click', ...);
[19:11:25] <shoky> i click some div
[19:11:40] <shoky> only the body's event listener is triggered by the browser
[19:11:49] <shoky> because that's the only place where an event listener was added
[19:12:07] <Prose> so if I wanted to have AJAX swap the contents of a div, but the button to swap those contents back and forth was INSIDE that div, could someone clarify to me how I go about properly handling the event delgation?
[19:12:11] <Velveeta> right, but if you do something like this:
[19:12:23] <Velveeta> $('body').on('click', 'div', function () ...
[19:12:29] <shoky> same thing
[19:12:37] <Velveeta> in some ways
[19:12:43] <Velveeta> the event itself is bound at the body level
[19:12:56] <Velveeta> but when jquery is passing the event object up the dom stack from parent to parent
[19:13:04] <shoky> jquery is not passing the event object anywhere
[19:13:07] <Prose> im kinda getting this...
[19:13:09] <Velveeta> it checks to see if we have a higher-level event listener bound that would relate to this element
[19:13:17] <shoky> because it didnt register an event listener anywhere, except the body
[19:14:51] <Velveeta> hold on, i'm wading through jquery src
[19:15:41] <Prose> Velveeta: so instead of specifying what to do on the form itself, such as $('#noteForm').submit(function()
[19:15:51] <Prose> instead I'd set this against a parent div?
[19:16:15] <Prose> and that way if the noteForm div is reloaded, the script will still function?
[19:16:25] <Prose> if I'm understanding you kind gentlemen correctly
[19:16:55] <Technical_13> Velveeta: shouldn't getPageText().done(function(pageCurrText){  be  var pageCurrText = getPageText().done(function(getPageText()){  ?
[19:17:27] <tp43_> you know the FileReader() api, they have an onload() javascript method, is there a jquery method for that?
[19:20:10] <Velveeta> ok, shaky, if you look in the src, when you add an event listener, part of its internals tell it that when this is triggered, route the function calls through jQuery.event.dispatch, which in turn routes through jQuery.event.handlers, which loops through all internal event data and finds delegated events and pushes them onto an array to be executed
[19:20:15] <Velveeta> shoky* sorry
[19:20:36] <JimmyXander> BIG PIMPIN BITCHES!
[19:21:07] <Velveeta> so what you say may be true for naturally occurring events in the browser, but at least in the case of triggering events via the trigger method, it will harvest all of those delegated events prior to reaching those higher dom levels
[19:21:12] <shoky> Velveeta: if its triggered with .trigger maybe
[19:21:17] <Velveeta> right
[19:21:24] <shoky> not if the browser triggers the event handler
[19:21:27] <Velveeta> so yeah, we both had valid points on that one
[19:21:29] <shoky> like.. a click
[19:21:30] <shoky> or a submit
[19:21:51] <Velveeta> right, if it's a naturally occurring browser event like the user actually clicking on something, then i suppose it would have to bubble
[19:21:55] <shoky> o you just said it heh
[19:22:02] <Velveeta> i didn't think about that because i'm used to widget development these days, and manually triggering events
[19:22:13] <Velveeta> so my mindset was on triggering programmatically :)
[19:22:32] <Velveeta> ok, now, prose, as to your question, you might be able to delegate your submit listener to a higher level.....
[19:22:40] <shoky> ;]
[19:22:48] <Velveeta> but like we just finished discussing, if it's a natural browser submit vs a programmatic trigger.......
[19:22:59] <JimmyXander> I need sleep
[19:23:06] <Velveeta> then your browser submit may take precedence before it bubbles up to that div wrapper
[19:23:12] <Velveeta> and do a regular submit vs an ajax one
[19:23:22] <Velveeta> so i would move the form outside of the div that's being redrawn
[19:23:34] <Velveeta> alternatively, do you have to redraw that form at all? can you just call a form.reset()?
[19:26:44] <BillCriswell> I wonder how much space I'd need to farm some watermelons.
[19:27:50] <Prose> cool Velveeta
[19:29:23] <Prose> yea I could just do form.reset()
[19:29:32] <Prose> i use AJAX to post the content to a ruote
[19:29:35] <Prose> *route
[19:29:44] <Prose> and then return the results to another div
[19:29:46] <Technical_13> Velveeta: did you see the pastebin log?
[19:29:47] <Prose> down teh line what I do want though
[19:30:04] <Velveeta> technical: nope, sorry, let me scroll back and look for the link
[19:30:06] <doug65536_> what? events bubble all the way up before default action happens
[19:30:34] <Prose> well, lemme get this working well first :)
[19:31:06] <Prose> but suffice to say, as long as I have the trigger listener OUTSIDE of teh <div> that gets refreshed/dynamically loaded, regardless of whtehr there is a form in there or not, the new contents will work, correct?
[19:31:08] <Technical_13> Velveeta: shouldn't getPageText().done(function(pageCurrText){  be  var pageCurrText = getPageText().done(function(getPageText()){  ?
[19:31:14] <Prose> sorry if I'm running around in circles
[19:31:20] <Technical_13> Also was a question
[19:31:47] <doug65536_> Technical_13: no
[19:31:59] <Technical_13> Thanks doug
[19:32:20] <Technical_13> Have you seen what I've been working on?
[19:32:26] <doug65536_> Technical_13: it "chains" like a selector. done returns whatever is on the left hand side, not the data
[19:32:41] <Technical_13> It's so close.
[19:33:07] <Velveeta> right, you're setting up an async listener for the ajax request itself, if you return that into a variable, you're just returning the deferred promise into that variable, not the response of the request itself
[19:33:14] <doug65536_> Technical_13: in other words, .done returns 'this'
[19:33:32] <Technical_13> Ah.
[19:33:39] <Technical_13> This makes sense
[19:33:42] <Velveeta> well done returns the promise for continued chaining
[19:33:48] <Velveeta> as far as i know anyway
[19:33:55] <doug65536_> Velveeta: yeah, 'this
[19:33:58] <Velveeta> because you can go .done().fail().always()
[19:34:00] <Velveeta> gotcha
[19:34:08] <Technical_13> I spent like four days trying to understand "this"
[19:34:08] <Velveeta> oh i see what you're saying, internally it returns 'this'
[19:34:16] <doug65536_> Velveeta: yes
[19:34:21] <Velveeta> i thought you meant the context of the function that was calling it
[19:34:57] <doug65536_> Velveeta: lol, yeah, 'this' creates a lot of human communication problems, its meaning changes from place to place :)
[19:35:14] <Velveeta> heheheh
[19:35:37] <Velveeta> so, technical, you're still just outputting the .toString() representation of your response as [object Object]
[19:35:45] <Velveeta> you'll need to set a breakpoint to inspect the response object
[19:36:00] <Velveeta> because whatever you're trying to do a string.replace() on is going to be a property of that response object is my guess
[19:36:10] <Velveeta> you just have to figure out how to properly dereference that path
[19:36:35] <Velveeta> so it might be like pageCurrText.html.replace() or something
[19:37:06] <Velveeta> you can try console.logging, instead of pageCurrText itself, since your console doesn't want to see to resolve that, output JSON.stringify(pageCurrText)
[19:37:17] <Velveeta> so console.log(JSON.stringify(pageCurrText));
[19:37:24] <Technical_13> I just realized that since we added .done pageCurrText wasn't defined as var.  Just added ir to global.
[19:37:53] <Velveeta> well you probably don't want a global reference to it
[19:38:09] <Velveeta> you're receiving pageCurrText as a function parameter, so it's locally scoped to that function, which is probably all you need
[19:38:51] <Technical_13> Okay.
[19:43:25] <Technical_13> Velveeta: the stringify says it's getting the whole response back and not just the content of the page.
[19:43:40] <JimmyXander> lies
[19:43:56] <Velveeta> can you dump that to pastebin?
[19:44:12] <Technical_13> As we speak
[19:44:18] <Velveeta> sweet
[19:44:54] <Technical_13> !pastebin netTNAa8
[19:45:27] <Technical_13> http://pastebin.com/netTNAa8
[19:45:47] <JimmyXander> : !pastebin netTNAa8

[19:45:54] <doug65536_> anyone what?

[19:46:35] <El_Caballero> Hello team. I need to add a minLength to a autocomplete on Jqueryui Mobile. But I don't have the constructor like '#CompanyName').autocomplete({}).... how can I add it?
[19:46:42] <Technical_13> The other channel makes the link with a command like that and I'm lazy
[19:47:12] <doug65536_> Technical_13: too lazy to press alt+D, Ctrl+c, alt+tab, Ctrl+v, enter?
[19:47:37] <Technical_13> Code is on my laptop and I'm on IRC on Android
[19:47:43] <doug65536_> ah ok
[19:48:34] <Velveeta> ok, so i have those json dump here, but am unsure of exactly what field you're gonna be looking to string replace
[19:49:33] <Velveeta> my *guess* is that you're looking for pageCurrText.query.pages[pageCurrText.query.pageids[0]].revisions['*']
[19:49:39] <El_Caballero> http://pastebin.com/TgHgRfJb that is the autocomplete view. And it is called like ....  vMarcas    = new MIS.View.VistaMarcas($("#atcMarca"))
[19:49:45] <Velveeta> so you would do that entire chain and add your .replace to the end of that
[19:49:58] <Technical_13> Ahh.
[19:50:06] <El_Caballero> oh, sorry. Called like..... vVersiones = new MIS.View.AutocompleteGenerico($("#atcVersion")),
[19:50:18] <Technical_13> Okay... can I just store that to a variable?
[19:50:33] <El_Caballero> being atcVersion a ul.
[19:50:52] <El_Caballero> so... where do I add the minLength??
[19:51:40] <Velveeta> depends on when you want that minlength to take effect
[19:51:44] <doug65536_> El_Caballero: you still don't have this working? there must be a bug somewhere else
[19:51:59] <Velveeta> whenever you do, you would set it as $(selector).autocomplete('option', 'minLength', value);
[19:52:12] <Technical_13> Better yet... since I will need that for any function, I can set it global... I think I know how. :)
[19:52:57] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: I want it to take effect in all my autocompletes. I suppose I have to put it in the constructor I showed you. But I don't know how.
[19:53:11] <El_Caballero> doug65536_: No man :(. Almost a week doing that :'(
[19:53:54] <Velveeta> well i don't see where you're actually instantiating the autocomplete
[19:53:58] <Velveeta> just where you're refreshing it
[19:54:00] <doug65536_> El_Caballero: for hard bugs like this, it is a good idea to strip it down to basics, and gradually introduce more of the original code until it breaks
[19:54:09] <Velveeta> so ideally you'd add that option to wherever you're creating it
[19:54:42] <doug65536_> I wish jsfiddle had a search function for my fiddles :|
[19:55:23] <El_Caballero> ok ok Velveeta. Let me try it
[19:59:43] <Technical_13> doug65536: I wish jsfiddle had a lot of things.
[19:59:53] <Technical_13> I wish GitHub did too.
[20:01:07] <doug65536> I used to use github, until I found bitbucket
[20:01:12] <doug65536> github is a ripoff
[20:04:04] <duckgoose> github is all confusing to me
[20:04:14] <duckgoose> I'm upload to just zipping up source code updates and upload
[20:04:15] <duckgoose> ing
[20:04:36] <duckgoose> thats my idea of open
[20:04:56] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: see here. http://pastebin.com/8TbSh3SL . at line 140.
[20:04:58] <Technical_13> Velveeta: sooo close..
[20:05:20] <Technical_13> PageID not defined now.  Think I can get that though.
[20:05:29] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: Commented line gives a syntax err ( app is not deployed properly, it only shows an empty screen ).
[20:05:41] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: and the line 141 doesn't work
[20:07:28] <Technical_13> Hi Elsie
[20:08:16] <El_Caballero> is that the only way to set the minLength? It doesn't work for me :(
[20:08:17] <Velveeta> caballero: try $vMarcas.$el.autocomplete
[20:08:41] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: oh, ok
[20:08:51] <Velveeta> well that's not the only way to set it, but the other ways would involve either you setting it at the time you instantiate the autocomplete, or you could do it with a data- attribute i believe
[20:09:02] <Velveeta> data-minLength="4" on your node itself
[20:10:15] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: that gave systax err. $vMarcas.$el.autocomplete . I will try to add data-minLength="4"  in the ul
[20:10:50] <Velveeta> ok
[20:11:55] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: data-minLength="4"  shows the autocomplete, but it still shows the options after the first letter
[20:12:28] <El_Caballero> I added it like that
[20:12:29] <El_Caballero> <ul id="atcMarca" data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data-filter="true" data-filter-reveal="true" data-minLength="4" >
[20:16:36] <Velveeta> hmmm, weird… and you're using the jquery ui autocomplete right? i seem to remember you saying last night that you had a jquery plugin version that was different, but were looking to migrate over to the jquery ui one
[20:16:46] <Velveeta> or maybe i'm thinking of someone different with a similar problem
[20:17:27] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: It was me. I think I am using the jquery autocomplete.
[20:17:37] <Velveeta> but not the jquery ui one?
[20:18:00] <El_Caballero> how can I check that?
[20:18:21] <Velveeta> in your backbone view implementation, in your render widget (so we know it's instantiated already)
[20:18:49] <El_Caballero> http://pastebin.com/TgHgRfJb
[20:19:00] <Velveeta> add this: console.log($(this.$el).data('autocomplete'));
[20:19:01] <El_Caballero> that is the implementation of the view
[20:19:10] <El_Caballero> ok ok
[20:19:24] <Velveeta> also, wrapping this.$el in a constructor call $() is unnecessary, this.$el is a reference to a jquery-wrapped version of that element to begin with
[20:19:36] <Velveeta> so you could just say this.$el.data('autocomplete')
[20:21:42] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: http://pastebin.com/0EuTkFJg that gave undefined after in the line 17.
[20:22:15] <Velveeta> ok, sounds like the jquery plugin version then, not the autocomplete version, which makes sense why it's ignoring that option
[20:24:23] <Velveeta> i found documentation on *a* jquery autocomplete plugin, but not sure if it's the same one you're using
[20:24:51] <Velveeta> try doing this.$el.autocomplete.setExtraParams({minChars: 4});
[20:25:04] <Velveeta> and then this.$el.autocomplete.flushCache();
[20:25:34] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: in the backbone view impl?
[20:26:05] <Velveeta> yeah for now
[20:26:15] <Velveeta> if it works, we can figure out where to relocate it
[20:27:29] <El_Caballero> "has no method 'setExtraParams' "
[20:28:09] <Velveeta> damn, guess that's not the right version then :D
[20:29:30] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: well, original problem is that the autocomplete is so slow with a lot of elements. I think that with the minLength it will work.
[20:29:40] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: that is why I want to put it there
[20:29:44] <Technical_13> Velveeta: I got it!

[20:29:58] <Technical_13> ^^^ that's it working
[20:30:08] <Velveeta> technical: woo hoo! :D
[20:30:16] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: But.. I haven't been able to add it. :(
[20:30:16] <Technical_13> Tomorrow I can add the rest of the features.
[20:31:03] <Velveeta> caballero: any way you can find out what version you have?
[20:31:13] <Velveeta> it's probably written at the top of its file, in some comments
[20:31:34] <El_Caballero> jquery version?
[20:31:37] <El_Caballero> one sec
[20:33:25] <Velveeta> not jquery version, jquery autocomplete version
[20:33:28] <Velveeta> like who wrote it
[20:38:23] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: well... I don't find the autocomplete declaration in the includes :-o
[20:39:04] <El_Caballero> where can be that ?
[20:43:51] <Velveeta> not sure, if you look at the page src do you see a script tag for it?
[20:46:07] <rigel> i would like som ehlp
[20:46:19] <T13|sleeps> rigel: just ask
[20:48:49] <El_Caballero> Velveeta: oh, found it
[20:48:50] <El_Caballero> http://pastebin.com/jJ1UvcTT
[20:49:40] <rigel> http://jsfiddle.net/tp3pX/
[20:50:06] <rigel> i'm trying to get the button to show the explanation in its div, but i am not much of a javascript person
[20:50:26] <Velveeta> yeah that plugin has no option for a minlength type of parameter, you would have to actually program one into it yourself
[20:53:46] <rigel> where the "show" button in whichever div shows the explanation in the same div
[20:54:06] <tp43_> how can you check if a file upload element has a file or not?
[21:28:56] <El_Caballero> Hello again team... does anyone know where the search function is triggered?
[21:29:08] <El_Caballero> In this autocomplete?
[21:29:08] <El_Caballero> http://pastebin.com/jJ1UvcTT
[22:46:19] <herpderpderp> i have a simple ajax call which works perfectly on my desktop firefox browser
[22:46:42] <herpderpderp> but does not work on "any" android browser: firefox, chrome, stock
[22:46:52] <herpderpderp> i have tried jquery, jquery mobile, and zepto as backends
[22:46:54] <herpderpderp> what gives?
[22:47:04] <herpderpderp> (and yes, i have tried searching for this problem)
[23:20:40] <herpderpderp> hello?
