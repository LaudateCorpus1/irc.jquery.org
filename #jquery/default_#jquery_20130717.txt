[00:17:50] <noregret> I have a <div> with several <p>s how can I get the 2nd <p> ?
[00:17:58] <ph88> $el.html($el2)    ... this works   but this doesn't   $el.html($el2 + $el3)  .. why is that ?
[00:18:19] <ph88> noregret: net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/
[00:18:45] <noregret> ph88: if $e12/13 is an object, you can't add them like that, addition is for strings or ints
[00:20:41] <ph88> how do i get those two objects inside the $el element ?
[00:20:56] <ph88> (they are all jQuery with selectors)
[00:21:26] <noregret> did you try append ?
[00:21:39] <ph88> well append works ... but then i have to do them one by one ...
[00:21:50] <ph88> might be slow to re-flow the dom on each iteration
[00:22:14] <Cork> ?.eq @ noregret
[00:22:15] <bot-t> noregret, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[00:23:07] <Cork> noregret: also you can't add up two dom elements
[00:23:51] <Cork> opps the last one was ph88 :x
[00:23:53] <noregret> Cork: i was ever trying to
[00:23:55] <noregret> :D
[00:24:27] <ph88> >>> $( [el, e2, e3] )       // works    (according to some stackoverflow)
[00:24:32] <Cork> $('div p').eq(num) is how to get what you want anyway
[00:24:51] <Cork> ?eval [1,2] + [3,4]
[00:24:54] <bot-t> Cork: "1,23,4"
[00:25:00] <Cork> that is why it doens't work
[00:25:07] <Cork> ?eval typeof([1,2] + [3,4])
[00:25:08] <bot-t> Cork: "string"
[00:25:12] <ph88> http://stackoverflow.com/a/13904191
[00:25:27] <Cork> ph88: you can use add if you want
[00:25:34] <ph88> well nvm .. ill just just multiple append then
[00:25:42] <Cork> $el1.add($el3)
[00:25:59] <Cork> uh i meant $el1.html($el2.add($el3))
[00:26:50] <Cork> ph88: but basically you can't add one object/array to another and get a new combined object/array
[00:27:01] <ph88> so i can construct an empty jQuery and then keep adding the new $el1..2..3..4 to each iteration and then append that object to the "master" jquery object ?
[00:27:07] <Cork> you have to loop it and add each member to a new one
[00:27:27] <Cork> ph88: yes if you save the new generated object
[00:27:46] <ph88> why does it have to be saved ?
[00:28:03] <Cork> var o = $(); o = for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++) { o.add(elm[i]); }
[00:28:08] <Cork> bagh sorry
[00:28:16] <Cork> var o = $(); o = for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++) { o = o.add(elm[i]); }
[00:28:24] <Cork> ...
[00:28:36] * Cork wonders if he's sleep walking or something...
[00:28:38] <ph88> ye that looks nice
[00:28:43] <Cork> var o = $(); for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++) { o = o.add(elm[i]); }
[00:28:44] <ph88> im not fully awake either lolz :p
[00:28:53] <Cork> finally a correct one
[00:29:18] <Cork> basically add outputs a new object, it doens't modify the original one
[00:30:30] <ph88> that's okay
[00:34:57] <ph88> worked, thx Cork
[00:40:23] <rabbi1> I am placing a marker on google map on focusout of a text field, it is working… but if i go back to the text field and focusout again, i am getting another marker….. how can i avoid this ?
[00:41:00] <billyjoe_> Is there a jquerymobile popover widget somewhere? (Otherwise I'll try one for jquery, those might work as well)
[00:41:45] <Cork> rabbi1: clear the field?
[00:44:06] <rabbi1> Cork: nope, marker
[00:44:26] <Cork> rabbi1: i meant clear the text field, and if it is empty don't create a marker
[00:44:58] <rabbi1> my marker variable is set under the focus event and i can't get the marker variable to remove it before another is added….
[00:45:25] <Cork> uh, what?
[00:45:51] <Cork> sounds like you have two event listeners or something then
[00:46:22] <rabbi1> Cork: nope, i may not be empty, the text field is city, the user may give california first and focusout… later he may come back and change the text to new york, now i get two markers one at california and one at new york, i just want the marker of the latest one… (remove the previous marker)
[00:46:53] <Cork> ok, so you want to remove existing markers before creating a new one?
[00:47:04] <rabbi1> Cork: yeap
[00:47:28] <Cork> so save a reference to the marker, and before you create one, remove the old one
[00:52:09] <rabbi1> Cork: i think i got a reference, thanks
[00:53:34] <rabbi1> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14412139/google-maps-api-v3-remove-marker-before-adding-new-one-from-click-event in this answer, again the marker is available globally, my logic is slightly different :(
[01:00:53] <gotwig> howdy
[01:01:02] <gotwig> console.log("hello world");
[01:01:14] <gotwig> guess what, I need help ;D
[01:02:05] <gotwig> So I got a tag, which is meant to hold my other span elements. This parent tag is a userlist, it holds span elements (which are the user names)
[01:02:30] <gotwig> now I want to remove a username, when a user lefts, my code is the following. But it does not remove the span element, but the whole userlist parent tag
[01:02:32] <gotwig> 					this.options.containerEl.find(".module-userlist").filter(":contains("+user+")").remove();
[01:03:08] <Cork> gotwig: jus a side not, it sounds like you should be using ul and lis instead
[01:03:19] <Cork> as it sounds like your working with a list of users
[01:03:31] <Cork> just semantics but anyway
[01:03:40] <gotwig> it seems I select the wrong object for removing
[01:03:41] <rabbi1> Cork: Hey, thanks, I used another .focus function for text field, so now if focus will remove the existing marker focusout will add a new one. ..
[01:04:16] <Cork> gotwig: should you show the html generated?
[01:04:29] <Cork> *could
[01:04:33] <gotwig> yeah, wait
[01:06:17] <gotwig> Cork: I made a fiddle just for you :3 http://jsfiddle.net/BWaqb/
[01:06:58] <gotwig> oh no
[01:07:00] <gotwig> I am stupid..
[01:07:01] <gotwig> wrong code
[01:08:32] <gotwig> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/BWaqb/1/
[01:09:46] <gotwig> other guys can help as well ;P if you like
[01:11:04] <Cork> gotwig: http://jsfiddle.net/BWaqb/2/
[01:12:29] <gotwig> trololol it works
[01:12:33] <brokennoze> hi, I'm struggling with the animate callback on 1.9.1 I I'm calling the stop() but the callback fires anyway, is this a bug of is there a reason for it?
[01:12:37] <gotwig> Cork: :3
[01:13:48] <Cork> brokennoze: are you setting the jumpt to end boolean?
[01:14:06] <brokennoze> no, default.
[01:14:17] <brokennoze> do i need to then?
[01:14:36] <Cork> no, it shouldn't call the callback unless that value is true
[01:14:43] <Cork> (and it is false by default)
[01:15:32] <brokennoze> OK, well it must be a bug then?
[01:17:05] <Cork> brokennoze: can't reproduce http://jsfiddle.net/Yjds9/
[01:17:23] <Cork> the callback isn't called for me if i stop the event before it finishes
[01:17:49] <brokennoze> http://pastebin.com/ESq0g75U
[01:18:04] <Cork> try to reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[01:18:07] <brokennoze> I'm probably doing something stupid
[01:18:13] <Cork> dead pb's is not helpfull
[01:18:28] <Cork> also try to simplify the code, you will prob find what goes wrong that way
[01:19:57] <noregret> shouldn't dialog.destroy() kill the instance? since when i reinitialize the dialog, the fields that i already filled will be still there, why is that ?
[01:20:35] <Cork> cause it will kill the js class, but won't remove the content in the original dom element
[01:20:55] <Cork> $().empty().dialog('destroy') should work though
[01:21:12] <brokennoze> OK thanks Cork.
[01:24:53] <qom2> http://pastebin.com/UvNdD4jR – how can I make this work?
[01:25:40] <brokennoze> Cork, thanks for tyour help, stupid bug after all that!
[01:25:56] <Cork> qom2: $('a[href*="'+active+'"]')
[01:26:22] <Cork> brokennoze: ya, it normally is
[01:26:42] <noregret> Cork: thanks
[01:26:50] <gotwig> Cork: can you tell me how I can remove the line break?
[01:26:57] <Cork> brokennoze: and that is a tip i use a lot, reduce the problem before asking, you will find that you often don't need to ask :)
[01:27:03] <gotwig> Cork: for each li element
[01:27:17] <qom2> Cork: much obliged!
[01:27:23] <Cork> gotwig: li { display: inline;  } or li { display: inline-block;  }
[01:27:48] <gotwig> Cork: not really
[01:28:13] <rabbi1> Cork: Still unable to figure out a way to get the data for a particular date range :(
[01:28:15] <brokennoze> Cork, to be honest I had and spent all of yesterday scratching my head. sometimes you just need a slap in the face!
[01:28:22] <gotwig> Cork: it works :(
[01:28:38] <noregret> Cork: that remoed the whole content, it's also showing emty on reinitialization :) i think i'll just .reset() all teh forms in there
[01:29:01] <Cork> brokennoze: heh, ya, been there ^^
[01:30:22] <juarezpaf> Hey guys... I just used the ajax.load() to get some elements, so all my validations and events bind didn't work anymore. Any idea how to solve this guys?
[01:30:49] <ph88> ok what am i missing here .... http://jsfiddle.net/PTwkj/
[01:30:51] <Cork> juarezpaf: you most likely need to use delegated event listeners
[01:31:18] <juarezpaf> Cork: You mean .on()???
[01:31:20] <Cork> juarezpaf: see ?.on and also see ?.delegate
[01:31:23] <bot-t> juarezpaf, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:31:23] <bot-t> juarezpaf, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:31:40] <Cork> juarezpaf: not plain .on, but yes, .on can express it
[01:31:51] <zfmf1> he guys, i have a sortable div, how i can bind the hover effect to this items , i tried with .on, .bind('mouseover'..., .bind('sortover'... no one works anyone an idea???
[01:32:07] <juarezpaf> I use .on() in all my events, but still not work!
[01:32:44] <Cork> ph88: css specific order rules http://jsfiddle.net/PTwkj/1/
[01:32:48] <juarezpaf> bot-t do you recommend change everything from .on() to .delegate()
[01:33:15] <Cork> juarezpaf: are you using the delegated syntax for on?
[01:33:16] <ph88> oki thx Cork
[01:33:30] <Cork> or just plain on?
[01:34:22] <Cork> juarezpaf: i linked to both cause delegate is linkable, but you can express it with .on too
[01:34:29] <Cork> you just need to read the docs if you want to
[01:34:32] <noregret> so I have a button that clones the whole parent including the button, but the hover mode is cloned as well when clicking on the button, what can I do here to clone the original button state, this is confusing
[01:35:00] <juarezpaf> Cork I think I am using plain .on()
[01:35:06] <Cork> noregret: something in js most likely sets a class, you would have to remove that
[01:35:08] <rabbi1> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/rbHhD/ i need to get all objects in data which fall within the date range :( can you please help ?
[01:35:13] <Cork> juarezpaf: then read the docs i linked to
[01:35:33] <noregret> Cork: true, several classes.. I didn't really want to go thru each class and remove it.. but i guess it's teh only way..
[01:35:50] <Cork> noregret: removeAttr('class') ?
[01:35:53] <juarezpaf> Cork: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9ac9331491dc96949c30
[01:36:39] <Cork> noregret: but ya, something like $clone.find('.ui-state-focus, .ui-state-over').removeClass('ui-state-focus ui-state-over') is the safer bet
[01:36:52] <Cork> juarezpaf: read the docs T_T
[01:37:00] <Cork> like i've said over and over again
[01:37:28] <Cork> juarezpaf: see ?.on  also see ?.delegate
[01:37:30] <bot-t> juarezpaf, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:37:30] <bot-t> juarezpaf, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:38:24] <juarezpaf> Thanks guys! I am going to look deeper in docs...
[01:38:27] <ph88> when i use css() i can get this to work just fine ... but when trying to move stuff to classes im stuck :|  http://jsfiddle.net/S4yDF/
[01:39:08] <juarezpaf> I have some validations using http://parsleyjs.org and after the .load() it just stop to work also. I am going try to figure this out over here.
[01:39:13] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/S4yDF/1/
[01:39:25] <Cork> ph88: you need to trigger reflow in the browser
[01:39:42] <ph88> wwohooo
[01:42:55] <noregret> Cork: after the cloning, the button classes are not added (like hover, etc..) should i .button() after cloning ?
[01:43:09] <Cork> noregret: yes
[01:45:41] <noregret> Cork: for some reason, caling button() each time makes hte buttons bigger and bigger in size... no idea what's happenning
[01:46:00] <Cork> noregret: could you try making a fiddle?
[01:46:42] <Cork> noregret: but if i remember correctly you need to remove some elements from the button
[01:46:48] <noregret> just a quick question, is there a way to compare the css of two elements quicky in firebug ?
[01:46:53] <Cork> cause .button() adds things to the dom
[01:47:06] <Cork> no not really
[01:47:28] <Cork> open two windows and run the page twice might be a nice way
[01:49:57] <noregret> Cork: ok, i found out that each call to button() adds <span class="ui-button-text"> recursively
[01:50:12] * Cork nods
[01:50:38] <Cork> ya, i did some cloning of ui buttons too a while back, and found it a pain to clean up
[01:50:39] <noregret> button() should support disable/enable, that way it'll created it
[01:50:52] <noregret> create*
[01:50:54] <Cork> noregret: you could run button('destroy') on it
[01:51:01] <kai> morning folks
[01:51:04] <Cork> but that would have to happen before you clone it i think
[01:51:18] <noregret> hmm
[01:51:42] <kai> I was trying to replicate a problem I was seeing in some JS code in jsfiddle, and jshint there tells me to not make functions within a loop..
[01:51:42] <noregret> the button will be gone that way from the prveoius element that is being cloned
[01:51:45] <kai> why not?
[01:52:13] <Cork> kai: depends on how you make the function
[01:52:19] <kai> I mean, that's likely the problem I'm running into, but I'm trying to dynamically generate a handler list
[01:52:45] <kai> http://jsfiddle.net/23F3K/ is what I'm trying to do
[01:53:08] <Cork> kai: that won't work
[01:53:16] <kai> doesn't seem to work at the moment, but how do I do it properly?
[01:54:02] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/23F3K/1/
[01:54:25] <Cork> kai: a for loop doens't create a scope, so the i will not stay around
[01:54:47] <kai> ah
[01:54:57] <Cork> kai: alternatively you can use $.each(inputs, function(input, i) {});
[01:55:02] <Cork> that would make that work for you
[01:55:13] <Cork> ?jquery.each
[01:55:14] <bot-t> jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[01:55:34] <Cork> bah it's the other way around
[01:55:45] <Cork> kai: $.each(inputs, function(i, input) {});
[01:56:02] <Cork> (i really don't get why they can't just pick one order and stick with it >_<)
[01:57:37] <noregret> how can I remove all classes from an element *but* one ?
[01:58:18] <kai> Cork: ok, I guess the lack of scope inside the loop confused me :/
[01:58:24] <kai> thanks for the heads up
[01:58:34] <Cork> noregret: removeClass().addClass('one to keep')
[01:59:38] <noregret> ah, didn't think of that
[01:59:39] <noregret> thanks
[02:01:05] <IamTrying> Google chrome browser, when internet is turned off, it shows some default off line page. How do i change that page contents?
[02:01:34] <Cork> IamTrying: what does that have to do with jquery?
[02:02:04] <IamTrying> Cork, does a lot. how do i load jquery in offline chrome? if i cant launch offline pages
[02:02:17] <IamTrying> Cork, in opera we can but chrome do we?
[02:02:34] <Cork> IamTrying: that is a browser question
[02:02:42] <Cork> not a jquery script question
[02:02:49] <IamTrying> Cork, -100
[02:02:58] <Cork> find a browser support channel and ask there
[02:05:46] <IamTrying> OK - Cork never mind. How do you eat RICE , with spoon or hand? if RICE was jQuery would you not have questions for spoon and hands?
[02:09:26] <Bauer> guys, anyone around? I need help with tooltip not working on this URL: https://store.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=virtualmachines2013 after updating jquery to latest version, and clearing duplicated jquery calls. it worked with jquery 1.4.4
[02:12:22] <hxm> is that web for free?
[02:23:46] <libin> i have got a html page, and have got couple of text fields in it. I can edit them on web broswer, but cannot edit them in mobile.. any clue??
[02:24:51] <Cork> libin: many mobile browsers has bugs in z-index and input elements
[02:25:12] <Cork> as they actually don't edit the field directly (they put an overlay ontop)
[02:25:26] <Cork> so you might have to fiddle with your css
[02:27:17] <libin> but it works on another webpage with same input tag
[02:27:39] <Cork> the css effect on the page might differ
[02:27:48] <rabbi1> Cork: could you please help me out with $.grep. I am getting all wrong data ….
[02:28:57] <Cork> rabbi1: not without seeing the call :)
[02:29:17] <Bauer> Cork: could you please take a look at https://store.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=virtualmachines2013 ? it gives error for $(document).tooltip(); in console, while it was working with older jquery
[02:29:21] <Bauer> I cant figure out why
[02:29:52] <Cork> Bauer: whats the error?
[02:30:11] <Bauer> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'tooltip'
[02:30:29] <Cork> is the lib loading and with no errors?
[02:30:41] <Bauer> yes, that is the only error in Console
[02:31:35] <Cork> $.fn.tooltip exists?
[02:32:05] <Bauer> says undefined
[02:32:11] <Cork> so the plugin isn't loaded
[02:32:26] <Bauer> but how? its part of jquery UI
[02:32:46] <rabbi1> Cork: i removed the old ones and tried with new one. http://jsfiddle.net/rbHhD/1/ this is it. ...
[02:32:48] <Cork> make sure the file with it is loaded
[02:33:10] <Bauer> how to make sure? since there is no error in console I assume it loaded
[02:33:24] <Bauer> the page has <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.ccc.co.il/Js/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[02:33:34] <Cork> rabbi1: you have a global variable in the for loop
[02:34:06] <rabbi1> yeah, i want to get data, matching all 5 dates in the array
[02:35:05] <Cork> rabbi1: i meant for(i;...) is dangerous
[02:35:10] <Cork> you should define the i
[02:35:49] <Cork> rabbi1: and comparedates makes no sense...
[02:36:14] <Cork> why would you stor a fraction of 2013 / 07 / 01 in an array?
[02:36:16] <Cork> ?eval 2013 / 07 / 01
[02:36:26] <Cork> oh
[02:36:33] <Bauer> Cork: seems you are right, ui is not loaded at all not just the tooltip function. but I cant figure out why... the link is valid as you saw above...
[02:36:34] <Cork> js> print(2013 / 07 / 01)
[02:36:40] <b-ot> Cork: 287.57142857142856
[02:36:48] <rabbi1> Cork: syntax is ok, have no problem, but the logic is where i am lost….
[02:37:41] <Cork> rabbi1: why do you expect "2013-07-01 00:00:00" >= 287.57142857142856 to be a valid test?!?
[02:37:49] <rabbi1> Cork: that date is dynamic sent by the user….. it's not in that format its just date
[02:37:53] <rabbi1> let me change it
[02:39:45] <rabbi1> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/rbHhD/2/
[02:40:05] <Cork> rabbi1: thats still not valid...
[02:40:19] <Cork> js> print([2013-07-08 00:00:00, 2013-07-09 00:00:00, 2013-07-10 00:00:00, 2013-07-11 00:00:00, 2013-07-12 00:00:00])

[02:40:27] <RabSimpson>  just enter TF07BBA. thanks :)
[02:40:44] <Cork> rabbi1: that won't parse
[02:40:53] <Cork> rabbi1: are you having an array of strings or what?
[02:42:18] <rabbi1> Cork: give me some moment will fix that
[02:43:13] <Cork> RabSimpson: i suspect it's //@ sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map it warns about
[02:44:36] <RabSimpson> hi cork :) i can't find that. where abouts did you see it?
[02:44:57] <Cork> RabSimpson: second line in your jquery lib
[02:45:29] <RabSimpson> hmmm, that's bloody useful. it's being loaded by WP.
[02:46:03] <OnkelTem> Hi all. What's wrong with $('input').bind('click', function() {...});? Looks like instead of each INPUT element has it's own click handlier, every INPUT element get's several handles
[02:46:13] <Cork> RabSimpson: secondly if by ie you mean < ie9
[02:46:17] <Cork> RabSimpson: SCRIPT445: Object doesn't support this action
[02:46:17] <Cork> valuation-engine.min.js, line 1 character 760
[02:46:29] <Cork> or if you are in the compatibility mode
[02:47:07] <RabSimpson> i'm in ie9 at the moment
[02:47:23] <Cork> RabSimpson: make sure it isn't in compatibility mode then
[02:47:28] <RabSimpson> ok just a sec
[02:47:30] <Cork> OnkelTem: no, that will bind one handler to each element
[02:47:55] <Cork> OnkelTem: for each time you run it that is
[02:49:04] <RabSimpson> switched it off, same issue :(
[02:49:35] <RabSimpson> i wasn't aware that that's what that broken page icon in the address bar was. i was under the impression it was a broken script indicator.
[02:49:40] <OnkelTem> Cork: hah, thank you for your note. I've just found error - I'm inside a loop :)
[02:49:41] <Cork> RabSimpson: i get no errors in ie9 if i load that url
[02:49:50] <Cork> RabSimpson: unless i enable compatibility mode
[02:50:21] <Cork> RabSimpson: no it's not, it is to flip the browser to ie6 compatible mode
[02:50:30] <RabSimpson> which url are you loading? /valuation/ or /?
[02:50:55] <Cork> valuation
[02:51:32] <RabSimpson> ok, if you load / then enter a registration (use TF07BBA, it's the client's car) you'll see where things go wrong
[02:51:52] <RabSimpson> you're right though, no browser errors, just a bloody thing that isn't working
[02:51:55] <Cork> (ps. i HATE debugging ie...)
[02:52:05] <RabSimpson> cork: same
[02:52:32] <Cork> if only they could get a decent debug console life would be a lot easier...
[02:52:44] <RabSimpson> completely agreed
[02:53:31] <Cork> only thing i get is "SEC7115: :visited and :link styles can only differ by color. Some styles were not applied to :visited. "
[02:53:51] <RabSimpson> same here
[02:53:58] <RabSimpson> is the page body blank?
[02:54:10] <Cork> more or less, ya
[02:54:21] <Cork> put some console.log and see how far it gets
[02:54:27] <RabSimpson> ok
[02:55:04] <RabSimpson> looking at my js console.log has been on for the json object the whole time
[02:55:26] <RabSimpson> or rather, console.debug
[02:55:43] <Cork> i don't think ie has console.debug
[02:55:53] <Cork> and that would explain why it crashes
[02:55:54] <RabSimpson> trying .log
[02:56:07] <Cork> also ie doens't have console.log if developer tools isn't open
[02:56:34] <RabSimpson> dev tools is open, log is still empty
[02:57:01] <Cork> so try adding it earlier then
[02:57:07] <RabSimpson> ok
[02:57:14] <OnkelTem> I've got an XML document on $.ajax() request and want to output it somewhere in the current page. But I get Chrome error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'ownerDocument' of null
[02:57:23] <Cork> cause something isn't running, and knowing ie, it just misses that it crashes or something >_<
[02:57:50] <OnkelTem> For printing I use: $('#result').append($(data));
[02:57:53] <dan2k3k4> how can I select 'body' tag? $(body) ? it gives undefined sometimes
[02:58:11] <Cork> dan2k3k4: $('body')
[02:58:31] <dan2k3k4> ah
[02:58:33] <dan2k3k4> thanks
[02:58:48] <Cork> OnkelTem: try just doing $('#result').append($('<div>').text(data));
[02:58:54] <RabSimpson> cork i'm feeding it console.log( json ); as json is the name of the object most at play here, should i remove that parameter and just put console.log(); at the top of my script?
[02:59:05] <Cork> OnkelTem: xml can be tricky as it might not be working for html documents
[02:59:28] <Cork> RabSimpson: console.log('start')
[02:59:36] <RabSimpson> ok, trying it
[02:59:51] <Cork> or if that doens't work, try something like alert('start')
[02:59:55] <Cork> it is ie after all...
[03:00:04] <RabSimpson> ok
[03:00:09] <rabbi1> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/rbHhD/3/ any thoughts after this ?
[03:00:53] <RabSimpson> we've got LOG: start and that's it
[03:01:18] <Cork> RabSimpson: well that is what was expected
[03:01:26] <RabSimpson> ah :P
[03:01:33] <Cork> RabSimpson: now move it down and see if it still shows up
[03:01:40] <Cork> and if it does check the data you get
[03:03:31] <OnkelTem> Cork: thanks
[03:04:04] <koleS320> What will be selector to get all elements of class foo without 'this' ?
[03:04:21] <Cork> $('.foo').not(this)
[03:05:00] <omarpr> Hi guys, can I get some help with jQuery Validation plugin?
[03:05:02] <Cork> rabbi1: your returning in the for loop, so it won't ever check more then one value
[03:05:51] <RabSimpson> if i run console.log( json ); at the bottom it returns undefined
[03:06:00] <omarpr> I have being like 1 hour looking how to solve this... The error I get is that jQuery.validator type is undefined. I have linked in the head the jQuery.js and jQuery.Validate
[03:06:03] <omarpr> Any suggestions?
[03:06:18] <RabSimpson> the thing which loads the json object is on line 110 of val.js
[03:07:01] <koleS320> What will be selector to get all elements of class foo without 'this' ? Something like $('foo and not this') ?
[03:07:19] <omarpr> If you guys go here, you will see the same error: http://leagueofla.lionstechpr.com/index.php?p=register
[03:07:33] <omarpr> The error is: [06:06:43.441] TypeError: jQuery.validator is undefined @ http://leagueofla.lionstechpr.com/index.php?p=register:123
[03:08:35] <OnkelTem> Cork: hm, when I do that — $('div).text(data), I get just '[object Document]'
[03:09:22] <Cork> OnkelTem: so data is a parsed xml document
[03:09:26] <omarpr> Please, someone help me :(
[03:10:08] <Cork> OnkelTem: try text((new XMLSerializer()).serializeToString(data))
[03:10:32] <RabSimpson> omarpr: don't panic. if someone is around who recognises that error and can help you, they will.
[03:10:47] <OnkelTem> Cork: works :) Now it's a real string
[03:13:44] <Cork> omarpr: i think your using a different library then you think you do
[03:13:48] <Cork> omarpr: https://github.com/DiegoLopesLima/Validate#readme
[03:13:54] <Cork> this is the lib your using
[03:14:17] <Cork> (and it is validate not validator, and it doesn't have an addMethod function)
[03:14:26] <omarpr> I tried to download it
[03:14:30] <omarpr> the real one
[03:14:33] <omarpr> lets see, give me a second
[03:16:10] <omarpr> hey man you are awesome, I just get confused because they both have the same version)-0
[03:16:23] <omarpr> So I tried to download it from theother place and it said, you want to override? jaja
[03:16:28] <RabSimpson> cork it appears to be breaking down at the engine.loadDetails( regNo, renderVehicleDetails, handleError ); point
[03:16:38] <RabSimpson> i'll need to put this to the guys who developed that part
[03:16:56] <Cork> RabSimpson: good luck!
[03:18:27] <rabbi1> Cork: :( no way i am able to figure it out...
[03:19:17] <Cork> rabbi1: function() { for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++) { return some[i]; } } will only check 0 nothing else
[03:19:24] <rabbi1> I am doing it all wrong,
[03:19:35] <Cork> cause return will exit out of the function on first iteration
[03:19:53] <rabbi1> $.map() ?
[03:20:20] <rabbi1> k, i should not return there… should save in obj or array and then return ?
[03:20:27] <Cork> i suspect you want to return true or false if its in there
[03:20:36] <Cork> so create a variable
[03:20:58] <Cork> or actually
[03:21:08] <Cork> just use an if case and return if it isn't true
[03:21:24] <Cork> if(!test) { return false; }
[03:21:42] <Cork> or if(test) { return true; } if you want the other way around
[03:21:43] <rabbi1> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/rbHhD/5/
[03:22:05] <Cork> uh
[03:22:08] <rabbi1> I am getting all false :(
[03:22:17] <Cork> rabbi1: do you even have a clue about what the code does?
[03:22:53] <rabbi1> It return true if date is matching else false ?
[03:23:05] <Cork> `api jquery.grep @ rabbi1
[03:23:05] <b-ot> rabbi1: jQuery.grep(): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[03:23:16] <OnkelTem> Cork: is there something in jQuery which may help pretty-printing XML converted to a string? :)
[03:23:25] <Cork> OnkelTem: no
[03:23:29] <OnkelTem> Cork: ok :)
[03:24:07] <rabbi1> I am doing it all wrong
[03:25:09] <rabbi1> I don want true or false, i want the data which are all true
[03:25:45] <Cork> rabbi1: yes, and check what the function does
[03:25:53] <Cork> read up on it
[03:26:21] <Cork> rabbi1: the code i gave you a few weeks back was to get you going, you still need to read through it to understand, not just hack and slash it...
[03:27:08] <rabbi1> Cork: ok, i think need a little break now
[03:28:24] <rabbi1> Cork: i can get the data with single comparision but not for 5 dates.. that's were i am stuck
[03:28:26] <NiB> Hey, I'm new to jquery. I'm making a simple accordion plugin, and it works, yet i feel my code is not exactly elegant or optimized... does someone with some experience would take a look plz ? -> http://pastebin.com/qgqn8T3W
[03:29:10] <NiB> basically the goal is to make accordions and to keep all containers height the same
[03:29:32] <rabbi1> If i campare say startdate with Date.today() i get the result… and i can compare with enddate with some date …. but how can i dynamically change the right hand side compare date? so i used for loop. :( which is bad
[03:31:28] <Cork> rabbi1: not really you need to use loops
[03:31:57] <Cork> but you need to figure out what data you want to collect and do the collection on that level, and the tests needed in it
[03:33:06] <noregret>  if i want to go up and stop at a certain class, should i use parentsUntil() or closest() ?
[03:33:21] <rabbi1> Cork: hmmm, will get back, look in to $.grep more in detail… thanks a lot. u have been very help ful
[03:33:39] <Cork> noregret: what do you mean by to up?
[03:33:47] <Cork> and what is the result you want?
[03:34:08] <noregret> Cork: go up the element tree, parent by parent, so I can get hold of the main the parent with class X
[03:34:08] <Cork> noregret: closest stands for "find the closest parent that match the selector"
[03:34:11] <drager> Can you use jquery mobiles dialog as alert?
[03:34:29] <noregret> Cork: i see, what about parentsUnill
[03:34:32] <Cork> noregret: parents, and parentsUntil will give you an array of all the parent elements
[03:34:51] <noregret> ah, then closest should be used here
[03:34:52] <noregret> thanks
[03:35:28] <ideea> hi, guys, help pls :) http://screencloud.net/v/mOOp i have jqueryu ui slider, it works well for years now. but i need to implement quarters too..so..when i scroll it, it should be changde..1 q. 2012, 2q. 2012, 3q.2012, 4q 2012, 1q 2013..etc. how i cant achieve this?:<
[03:36:35] <Cork> ideea: just change the labels i guess
[03:36:49] <Cork> hard to tell from an image
[03:38:22] <ideea> Cork it should be 2 different inputs(hidden for example), labels - not problem :)
[03:38:35] <ideea> when i submit form  i should receive in backend quarter and year
[03:52:06] <mrHAT> ok, so i need to add some images into a html div container. the images are pulled out of a database using ajax. I currently do this on page load but i get an error where the container does not exists (other page).. so my question is ... how can i attach the images on that container only when it exists on the page like for example $(elem).click() { } , i need something like $(elem).whenpagehasloaded()
[03:52:06] <mrHAT> { this executes }
[03:54:27] <mrHAT> .ready() ?
[04:08:34] <drager> So I'm trying to keep score of points even if the browser is closed but I cannot get it to work. Ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/MqVrM/
[04:10:47] <miCSu> I'm trying to get some data from confluence rest api with ajax call. How can I find elements, when the name contains :? Method .find assumes it's a pseudoclass.
[04:28:21] <dabear> miCSu: double escape the colon
[04:28:28] <dabear> e.g. \\:
[04:28:33] <Bauer> Cork: Do you have any idea, why the  ui is not loaded at all? I cant figure out why... The order of the script is correct, no loading errors in console...
[04:28:54] <Cork> Bauer: link
[04:28:56] <Bauer> Cork: link to the page was: https://store.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=virtualmachines2013
[04:33:16] <Cork> Bauer: your using noconflict right?
[04:33:31] <Bauer> what? noconflict? wahts that?
[04:33:40] <Cork> ?.noconflict
[04:33:41] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[04:34:04] <Cork> ah, no sorry i read scripts as scriptish ^^'
[04:34:11] <drager> Anyone?
[04:34:15] <Cork> thought you loaded prototype too
[04:34:23] <Bauer> nope, we dont use prototype
[04:34:35] <Cork> Bauer: anyway you are loading jquery ui, but something is removing it
[04:34:59] <Bauer> Cork: hmmm, how were you able to come to that conclusion?
[04:35:31] <Cork> Bauer: i put a breakpoint in the jquery-ui file
[04:36:45] <Bauer> ah, so you conclude from the breakpoint being triggered, that it is loaded, and later must have been removed somehow? any idea how to continue debugging?
[04:37:51] <Cork> https://www.ccc.co.il/App_Themes/conf/compressed.js is overwriting your jquery
[04:38:06] <Cork> so you basically load jquery twice
[04:39:48] <Bauer> wow, you are right.. compressed.js also uses prototype from quick glance :( the file is from the platform vendor, now ours.. but is it responsible for running all the purchase processes
[04:40:06] <Bauer> how do you suggest to workaround this conflict? I use $ in my other customized scripts based on jquery
[04:40:35] <Cork> Bauer: remove your jquery lib, then move compressed to before jquery ui
[04:40:53] <Cork> (then yell at your platform vendor :P)
[04:44:34] <sifu> i have loaded JS once and it the top so can't really understand why i keep getting this Uncaught ReferenceError: JQuery is not defined  in Joomla...
[04:45:00] <Cork> sifu: link
[04:46:08] <sifu> Cork just a moment please
[04:46:20] <sifu> http://skoda.kee.uk.com/new-skoda/fabia
[04:46:31] <sifu> if you click on the Fabia Enquiry
[04:46:36] <sifu> on the left navigation
[04:56:38] <ph88> is it better to re-use the same dom element and change the contents around ... or is it better to have a large dom ?   in other words : cpu vs memory ... what will have the best user experience ?
[04:57:09] <Cork> ph88: there isn't a straight answer for that
[04:57:33] <Cork> if you have a fairly limited number of elements just showing and hiding the elements is way faster
[04:57:52] <Cork> but if you get to a point where it's about a huge amount of elements, the dom becomes slow
[04:58:05] <Cork> and the gc slows things down too
[04:58:18] <Cork> ph88: so it really depends on how much is much
[04:58:29] <ph88> it's for a popup .. like there are 5 buttons ... one can have their own pop-up ... or i can use the same pop-up and switch out the contents
[04:58:30] <Croves> Guys, I have this piece of code: http://pastebin.com/WWXHp1D2 The problem is, my .loader does not appear. But If I open the firebug console and write $('.loader').show(), it will work perfectily
[04:58:33] <Croves> Any idea?!
[04:58:41] <Cork> ph88: but i would go with duplicate elements, and do the other work if it's needed for performance
[04:58:47] <Bauer> Cork: at the end of that damn compressed.js, there is one line starting with: (function(){var l=this,g,y=l.jQuery,p=l.$,o=l.jQuery=l.$=function(E,F){return new o.fn.init(E,F)}, - is that the built in jquery I can just remove, to resolve the conflict for the time being?
[04:58:48] <ph88> oki thx Cork
[04:59:13] <Cork> Bauer: ya
[04:59:19] <NiB> you hide it just after u show it Croves..no ?
[04:59:28] <Cork> Bauer: if you do $ in firebug, and then click the function it takes you to that line
[04:59:37] <Cork> Bauer: that was how i found compressed.js
[04:59:47] <Croves> NiB Well, I'd like to hide it only when the response is ready
[04:59:47] <NiB> you should hide in success function
[04:59:53] <Croves> Oh
[05:00:03] <Croves> Well, that's quite obvious....
[05:00:08] <Croves> I'm just stupid
[05:00:09] <Croves> hehe
[05:00:14] <NiB> )
[05:02:28] <Croves> Thank you, NiB =)
[05:10:45] <airdem> hi guys
[05:11:06] <airdem> how can i tell jquery ui dialog to try to put multiple dialogs next to each other
[05:11:11] <airdem> and not on top of each other
[05:11:30] <Cork> airdem: you can't, you would have to do that manually
[05:12:35] <Bauer> Cork: the vendor has embedded jquery 1.3.2 THREE times into the compressed.js, any reason you can see? can I just remove them and replace with newer version?
[05:12:56] <Cork> Bauer: i would throw that lib away...
[05:13:07] <drager> So I'm trying to keep score of points even if the browser is closed but I cannot get it to work. Ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/MqVrM/
[05:13:24] <Cork> tell the provide to fix there shit to have dependencies instead of embedding it, or pick another one
[05:13:43] <sifu> Cork sorry for pining you but was wondering if you saw the link…Uncaught ReferenceError: JQuery is not defined
[05:13:47] <Bauer> Cork: I wish :) but its responsible for making the store work.. I cant just throw it :(
[05:14:00] <Cork> sifu: oh, no i did not
[05:14:17] <Cork> Bauer: then look for another store platform
[05:14:24] <Cork> cause the one really sucks...
[05:14:35] <sifu> Cork http://skoda.kee.uk.com/new-skoda/fabia
[05:15:06] <sifu> in the left nag there is a Send Enquiry link that loads a popup (at least in chrome)
[05:15:49] <sifu> but it comes up with a uncaught reference error in chrome and ffox/opera/ie doesn't even load the modal
[05:16:41] <Max-Might> why there is no checkboxradioMarkup() like buttonMarkup() method in jquery-mobile?
[05:18:19] <arschmitz> Max-Might: because checkboxradio is a widget
[05:18:38] <arschmitz> Max-Might: its not just markup
[05:18:43] <Cork> sifu: well you are using window.open, so i suspect your code runs in a separate page
[05:18:58] <sifu> hm...
[05:20:26] <sifu> that seems the reason so any way i could overcome it? or any better approach..sorry not much idea on javascript
[05:20:50] <Max-Might> arschmitz: so the only way to manipulate it is to use the option method? (besides manually modifying the classes)
[05:20:52] <Cork> sifu: well you depend on document.write for one...
[05:21:09] <arschmitz> Max-Might: yes that is correct
[05:21:28] <Cork> sifu: basically you over complicate the problem a bit i think, if you want window.open, just open a link from the server with the content
[05:21:51] <Cork> sifu: or make the content inline in the original page
[05:22:02] <sifu> Cork the idea was to open the form in a popup rather than a new page
[05:22:07] <Cork> no need for a popup honestly (as popup blockers will kill it anyway)
[05:22:11] <sifu> and i think the window.open comes from Joomla
[05:22:47] <sifu> if you see a link on that page right above the big 'Reqest a test drive' link (Enquiry Form)
[05:22:55] <sifu> it opens a popup for the enquiry form
[05:23:57] <johnharris85> i have a div with a video js player inside it. Works fine to start with, if i hide the div then show it again the video disappears, anyone got any ideas?
[05:24:10] <johnharris85> literally a straight div-swapping type thing, but the video player disappears
[05:27:27] <noregret> http://bpaste.net/show/W5lswSdrn1DatWNGri8S/ why the new page has an empty textarea? even thought the console.log() prints the data correcty
[05:28:27] <Cork> noregret: learn your html :)
[05:28:34] <Cork> textarea doesn't use value ^^'
[05:28:40] <noregret> oh
[05:28:56] <noregret> is it text between the <textarea> tags ?
[05:29:25] <Saaether> yes
[05:29:28] <noregret> yes it is :)
[05:29:35] <noregret> lol
[05:29:48] <Cork> noregret: $(w.document.body).html($('<textarea>').text(d.data).attr({ row: 10, cols: 100 }));
[05:30:20] <Cork> no need for the first line
[05:30:45] <Cork> and you can't put a head section through body
[05:31:05] <airdem> how can i tell $(this).siblings() to include "this" ?
[05:31:21] <noregret> I see, thanks
[05:31:56] <mobile8> Anyone in here good with image maps?
[05:32:00] <noregret> Cork: and it is var head = '<head><title>test</title></head>'; and it shows fine thgough
[05:32:06] <mobile8> (yes i know this is ancient)
[05:32:08] <Cork> airdem: siblings().andSelf() or just parent().children()
[05:32:19] <Cork> noregret: cause of error correction ya
[05:32:35] <Cork> noregret: just set document.title and keep the document valid
[05:32:57] <mobile8> Cork: you good with image maps by any chance
[05:33:00] <Cork> what you get  is <html><body><head><title></title></body></html>
[05:33:17] <Cork> noregret: and the browsers error correction will move the head out of the body
[05:33:32] <Cork> mobile8: not really, haven't used one in over 10 years
[05:33:37] <mobile8> Haha ok
[05:33:43] <mobile8> I thought this
[05:33:50] <mobile8> Anyway my question is pretty much JS too
[05:34:50] <mobile8> I've got an image map, I use rwdimagemaps to resize it (based on its size) the original image map is 1150px width, and the page container width is 1000px. I need a way to resize the img on load to 1000px
[05:35:03] <mobile8> (update and resize the coordinates)
[05:35:28] <Cork> mobile8: the img tag should scale by default just change its proportions
[05:36:02] <airdem> Cork, thank you
[05:36:07] <mobile8> Cork: the problem is
[05:36:11] <mobile8> the coordinates are absolute
[05:36:24] <mobile8> So I can't just resize the img by css only
[05:36:25] <Cork> tough luck :)
[05:37:00] <Cork> i would prob have built up the image though elements (divs) instead
[05:37:05] <noregret> Cork: i see, thanks
[05:37:06] <Cork> that way you can scale it just fine
[05:37:23] <mobile8> yea but on a complex map thats hard
[05:37:29] <mobile8> if it was simple i would have done thta
[05:37:42] <Cork> not really, as long as you have square areas
[05:37:49] <mobile8> not scare haha
[05:37:54] <mobile8> Wait i'll pm the link
[05:37:56] <Cork> then i would go with svg instead
[05:37:58] <mobile8> square * lol
[05:38:16] <Cork> opps :x
[05:38:17] <Cork> :d
[05:38:26] <mobile8> You see what I mean?
[05:38:35] <Cork> see what?
[05:38:38] <mobile8> the link
[05:38:43] <Cork> no
[05:38:45] <mobile8> Cork is in +g mode (server-side ignore.)
[05:38:46] <mobile8> oh gr8
[05:38:47] <mobile8> :P
[05:38:53] <Cork> ^^'
[05:39:28] <mobile8> Cork: http://goo.gl/Xvs3l
[05:39:33] <mobile8> I don't see how you can fix this with SVG neither
[05:39:36] <mobile8> Not the highlighting
[05:39:56] <mobile8> + have this compatible everywhere
[05:41:27] <mobile8> The issue is Chrome btw, firefox does this ok
[05:41:32] <mobile8> Webkit browsers
[05:42:28] <Cork> mobile8: that would be fairly easy with svg
[05:42:39] <Cork> i've done much more complext structures in svg
[05:42:54] <mobile8> Cork: you have any examples?
[05:43:34] <Cork> mobile8: not that i can share no, but 2 sec of googling http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/data-visualisation/interactive-svg-map
[05:44:35] <mobile8> resizing would still be an issue
[05:44:40] <mobile8> Or do you know any good plugins for this?
[05:44:42] <Cork> not really
[05:44:53] <Cork> cause the svg would be handling that
[05:45:03] <Cork> you get it for free
[05:45:22] <mobile8> WHat about:
[05:45:24] <mobile8> Note, Internet Explorer before IE9 can't render SVG and Firefox doesn't support mouse-over animation. It definitely works with Chrome and apparently works in Safari (thanks Al)
[05:45:26] <Cork> only real problem is that older ie doesn't support it
[05:45:34] <mobile8> and Firefox?
[05:45:35] <Cork> ya, you need to use vml for ie
[05:45:44] <Cork> firefox has supported it for ages
[05:45:47] <mobile8> ok
[05:46:29] <mobile8> Cork: I can use the same coordinates as I have now, right?
[05:46:52] <Cork> mobile8: you can use cooridnates, yes, but you might have to translate them
[05:47:00] <Cork> a little side note btw
[05:47:06] <Cork> ?g raphael.js
[05:47:07] <b-ot> Cork: Raphaël—JavaScript Library → http://raphaeljs.com/
[05:47:22] <Cork> it handles the compatibility for ie
[05:47:28] <mobile8> ahh good
[05:47:34] <mobile8> Any idea how the coords can be translated?
[05:47:45] <Cork> http://raphaeljs.com/world/
[05:47:47] <Cork> :)
[05:48:27] <mobile8> doesn't update though
[05:48:30] <Cork> mobile8: not even sure what coordinates you have now
[05:48:33] <mobile8> resize
[05:48:36] <mobile8> Well see the link source
[05:49:15] <Cork> ah, right...
[05:49:23] <Cork> those are references from the top right?
[05:49:29] <mobile8> Just traced it with Illustrator
[05:49:31] <Cork> it doens't work like that in svg
[05:49:33] <mobile8> references?
[05:49:35] <mobile8> Ahh damn
[05:49:42] <mobile8> That would take so much time I'm afraid
[05:49:46] <Cork> you create the element, and then you can bind an event on it
[05:49:49] <Cork> just like in html
[05:49:51] <Cork> (dom)
[05:50:00] <mobile8> Ahh yep I get it
[05:50:14] <mobile8> Don't know, I think I'll stick with what I have now
[05:50:15] <Cork> only difference is the element can be a path
[05:50:25] <Cork> with any number of turns and shapes
[05:50:43] <Cork> (or a circle, or arc, and so on)
[05:50:46] <mobile8> And the text and the background image would also be an issue
[05:50:51] <mobile8> If I decide to use SVG
[05:50:55] <Cork> not really
[05:50:59] <Cork> just add them as text
[05:51:13] <mobile8> Well background image actually not
[05:51:35] <Cork> the background image you could just add as that a background iamge
[05:51:38] <Cork> *image
[05:51:43] <mobile8> Actually want to use the yep
[05:51:43] <Cork> and have it scale with the svg
[05:51:47] <mobile8> and have transparent overlays
[05:51:49] <mobile8> on hover
[05:52:10] <mobile8> Actually want to use the svg, just don't feel like defining the coords again
[05:52:18] <Cork> :)
[05:52:43] <mobile8> Cork: anyway, do you see the difference in rendering ff versus webkit ?
[05:52:49] <mobile8> at my link
[05:53:26] <Cork> ya, you get different offsets
[05:53:45] <mobile8> but
[05:53:53] <Cork> but the entire image is offset in chrome
[05:53:56] <mobile8> yea
[05:54:55] <mobile8> Cork: but, look at the link now
[05:55:01] <mobile8> when its not centered
[05:55:05] <Cork> mobile8: a resize of the window fixes it though
[05:55:25] <Cork> so it looks like the code you have to resize things isn't triggered on load in chrome
[05:55:52] <mobile8> Cork: no, but it also doesn't resize in chrome when i scale the browser down
[05:56:01] <mobile8> and its strange that its not triggered
[05:56:20] <mobile8> ahh wait
[05:56:25] <drager> So I'm trying to keep score of points even if the browser is closed but I cannot get it to work. Ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/MqVrM/
[05:56:25] <mobile8> $(window).resize(rwdImageMap).trigger('resize');
[05:56:32] <mobile8> This doesn't happen on load Cork
[05:59:16] <mobile8> Cork: doing now load on resize but same issue :( damn
[06:06:25] <mobile8> Anyone has a suggestion?
[06:06:29] <mobile8> on how to solve this
[06:12:06] <miCSu> dabear: it doesn't seem to recognize them as elements. Tried with console.log($(data).find("ri\\:attachment").length) and it gives zero although I can see many of those tags there.
[06:20:05] <doug65536> drager: a cookie with an expires set can store data across browser sessions
[06:20:41] <doug65536> drager: another option is websql if you don't have to worry about old IE
[06:20:58] <drager> doug65536: I'm using localStorage
[06:25:17] <Saaether> drager: whats not working?
[06:25:30] <doug65536> drager: drager where do you read the initial score?
[06:25:39] <Saaether> other then the fact you dont sent the score when the page loads
[06:25:47] <Saaether> drager: http://jsfiddle.net/MqVrM/5/
[06:26:04] <doug65536> drager: you need to initialize score = +db.getItem('score');
[06:27:40] <doug65536> drager: http://jsfiddle.net/RVQHf/3/
[06:28:08] <doug65536> drager: I added 2 lines at line 17
[06:28:57] <drager> doug65536: Saaethers paste did work
[06:29:29] <Saaether> ya mine put the score on the page, just didnt assign its value to score
[06:29:42] <Saaether> gapped that
[06:30:25] <drager> doug65536's didnt work out
[06:31:32] <doug65536> drager: saaether's does't work for me
[06:31:36] <doug65536> drager: did you test it?
[06:31:42] <drager> Yeah
[06:31:45] <drager> Tested both
[06:32:00] <doug65536> drager: reload the page and test saaethers
[06:32:07] <Saaether> mine was missing a step, the score gets over written, but doug's should work
[06:33:11] <drager>  http://jsfiddle.net/RVQHf/3/ doesn't work
[06:33:28] <doug65536> drager: what browser? works for me in ff
[06:33:36] <drager> Using ff as well
[06:33:46] <drager> aw
[06:33:49] <doug65536> define "doesn't work". what is wrong
[06:33:52] <drager> I copied the wrong ulr
[06:33:54] <Saaether> works for me in chrome
[06:34:14] <drager> Now it works
[06:34:24] <drager> I took my paste and just added /3
[06:34:28] <drager> Sorry, my bad
[06:34:30] <drager> Thanks guys
[06:34:46] <doug65536> drager: np. I forked yours, that's why different url probably
[06:35:02] <drager> Yeah it is. Didnt see that ;)
[06:39:51] <doug65536> drager: fixed a bug in mine: http://jsfiddle.net/RVQHf/5/   fixes handling of localStorage not having a score
[06:41:04] <drager> doug65536: Cool, thanks!
[06:53:33] <Ungy> I am using jQuery 1.9.1 I am trying to figure out why the following bindign of on is doing nothing $("form").on("submit", "#" + vG.formId, function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); is there somethign I am missing?
[06:54:41] <systemfault> Because it doesn't make sense
[06:55:16] <RohanBhangui> lol
[06:55:19] <systemfault> If you use event delegation.. the selected element must be a parent
[06:55:34] <Ungy> ah thanks
[06:55:40] <systemfault> Ungy: Your code implies that you have a form inside a form… that's invalid
[06:55:42] <Ungy> gah too early
[06:56:12] <Ungy> $("body").on("submit", "form#" + vG.formId, function(e) { that'll work thanks
[06:56:33] <systemfault> It sure will
[06:58:41] <gho5t> you can omit the "form" before the #
[06:59:05] <Ungy> i know I can but wouldn't that affect performance?
[06:59:09] <gho5t> yes
[06:59:13] <gho5t> in a positive way
[06:59:32] <gho5t> jquery reads selectors from right to left
[06:59:38] <gho5t> just like css
[06:59:46] <Ungy> OK thanks
[06:59:49] <Ungy> makes sense
[07:12:25] <drager> Can you use jquery mobiles dialogs as alerts in js?
[07:14:02] <atpa8a> hello
[07:14:08] <RohanBhangui> hello
[07:15:46] <atpa8a> i'm looking for a functionality where i can change the content of certain "panels" based on "navigation" rules
[07:15:50] <atpa8a> any pointers?
[07:16:15] <RohanBhangui> what do you mean by navigation rules?
[07:16:35] <atpa8a> like... a menu
[07:17:00] <atpa8a> click a button, one or more panels get updated
[07:17:16] <atpa8a> click another, they get updated with some other views
[07:17:59] <RohanBhangui> does the page refresh when you click link
[07:18:13] <RohanBhangui> or are you using ajax requests when clikcing links?
[07:18:18] <RohanBhangui> *clicking
[07:20:20] <atpa8a> i would prefer to avoid refresh
[07:20:24] <RohanBhangui> sry im asking so many questions cause im trying to figure out is the best method to solve your problem
[07:20:46] <atpa8a> oh, by all means :) i'm very new to jquery
[07:21:01] <atpa8a> but we're extremely unhappy with one of our vaadin apps
[07:21:14] <atpa8a> with vaadin in general
[07:21:20] <RohanBhangui> so if your links when you click on them do not go to another page, then what you can do is use .html to replace the content of the div that you want to change
[07:21:35] <gho5t> atpa8a: it could be as easy as toggling some divs when a certain button is clicked, or updating the html()
[07:21:52] <RohanBhangui> +1 gho%t
[07:21:57] <RohanBhangui> *+1 gho5t
[07:22:05] <gho5t> but it gets more complicated if you want to update the history so you can use the backbutton
[07:22:11] <gho5t> not by much, but some
[07:22:21] <atpa8a> gho5t: might be not the best idea in our case... content of the panels is charts
[07:22:35] <atpa8a> so keeping all of such panels in memory is undesirable
[07:22:43] <gho5t> ah
[07:23:06] <gho5t> so just toggle the divs or replace the html based on the workflow
[07:23:10] <gho5t> easy enough
[07:25:31] <atpa8a> gho5t: an option, true
[07:25:45] <atpa8a> but is there "out-of-the-box" solution? a plugin?
[07:26:20] <gho5t> if you prefer to be able to switch out the views you could look into something like AngularJS
[07:26:24] <gho5t> but that might be overkill
[07:26:35] <gho5t> although I tend to build everything in it these days
[07:26:52] <gho5t> as far as a jquery plugin, I'm not sure
[07:27:11] <atpa8a> are those "layouting" plugins worth looking into?
[07:27:27] <worstadmin> How can I make an ajax call on an input field being updated - or even better validated using jquery validator
[07:27:30] <gho5t> maybe haven't used them
[07:27:32] <worstadmin> ?
[07:28:20] <gho5t> worstadmin: fire the call onkeydown or whatever event the validator is being fired on
[07:29:30] <atpa8a> also... is there any documentation on code organization, coding style, patterns?
[07:30:50] <gho5t> atpa8a: it's really starting to sound like you should like into a JS framework
[07:31:08] <gho5t> either AngularJS, Ember, Backbone, etc.
[07:32:12] <atpa8a> gho5t: quite possible
[07:32:15] <khmer>         ^ big        ^ medium   ^ small
[07:32:16] <gho5t> or read a good book on JS like http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1374071520&sr=1-2&keywords=javascript+design+patterns
[07:32:57] <atpa8a> i'm a java dev that always tried to stay away from any UI work :) but necessity will make you change your ways
[07:33:07] <gho5t> same
[07:33:19] <gho5t> former C# dev
[07:33:23] <gho5t> :)
[07:33:53] <gho5t> if you're slated for a lot of js work I recommend that book, John Resig's, or Crockford's "The Good Parts"
[07:34:00] <gho5t> or all 3
[07:34:11] <khmer> i'd wait to read crockford until you've written a bunch of stuff
[07:34:20] <khmer> crockford too early makes people into crackfords
[07:34:46] <gho5t> lol yeah it took me a while to realize he wasn't right about everything
[07:34:48] <khmer> there's something eerily compelling and addictive about arbitrary coding style rules
[07:34:56] <khmer> you can find yourself terribly limited
[07:35:07] <gho5t> it's compelling because it gives you a reason
[07:35:12] <gho5t> "crockford said to"
[07:35:22] <atpa8a> :)
[07:35:23] <khmer> and he was the first guy to try to be responsible in this language
[07:35:24] <gho5t> which makes life much easier
[07:35:26] <atpa8a> familiar story
[07:35:28] <khmer> but by no means the best
[07:35:41] <gho5t> I personally like Resig's book the best
[07:35:51] <gho5t> need to re-read again. lot to digest
[07:38:18] <khmer> yeah he's very practical and readable
[07:38:50] <arclv> join #angularjs
[07:38:52] <jeremy-> My jquery tabs does nothing and gives no console error when implementing the simple copy+paste demo. I've got a jquery accordion and various other things working fine. Any suggestions how I can trap the problem to work out why?
[07:38:59] <jeremy-> jquery ui tabs***
[07:40:31] <atpa8a> khmer, gho5t, appreciate the book recommendation, but i want to figure out if we even want to go in this direction first
[07:40:42] <gotwig> jo
[07:40:44] <atpa8a> reading on backbone.js
[07:40:52] <gotwig> do you know an alternative to :contains for me
[07:40:57] <gotwig> :contains filters everything
[07:41:04] <gotwig> but what if I exactly know what I want to do
[07:41:07] <gotwig> and no similar stuff
[07:41:24] <khmer> atpa8a: backbone is primarily useful as a set of reasonable defaults for MV*-style concern separation on the client, and a pretty good Model class
[07:43:26] <drager> In localStorage, can you store an array of strings?
[07:43:56] <atpa8a> my need is pretty simple (i think): i've 6-7 "views", each has a controls panel and content panel, content panel has charts that get drawn based on selections in the controls panel
[07:44:55] <atpa8a> i've a JSON web service that has all the data for controls population and charts data
[07:45:27] <atpa8a> weighting my options
[07:45:45] <tw2113> drager, if not, you could likely serialize the data first and store it that way, then fetch and unserialize
[07:46:07] <atpa8a> i'd like it to be as simple as possible, both in terms of functionality and maintainability (hoping to pass the UI portion to another dev in time)
[07:46:10] <drager> tw2113: That's what I'm trying to do
[07:46:30] <drager> tw2113: answer_info = ['carlsberg', 'falcon', 'budweiser']; db.setItem('answer_info', JSON.stringify(answer_info));
[07:47:20] <drager> tw2113: Nvm ;)
[07:47:31] <tw2113> got it working?
[07:48:26] <drager> tw2113: Yepp, I just parsed it then console.log(answer[1]);
[07:48:30] <drager> and got my value :)
[07:48:33] <tw2113> woo
[07:53:50] <khmer> atpa8a: backbone sounds like a good fit for you
[07:56:03] <tw2113> i'm still trying to come up with a great reason to give backbone a serious tire kicking
[07:56:05] <atpa8a> khmer: reading, thanks! :)
[07:56:52] <khmer> i personally don't use backbone for stylistic reasons and because i have peculiar requirements for two-way data binding
[07:57:09] <khmer> but for CRUD UIs it can produce some very clean code
[07:57:31] <gho5t> khmer: what do you prefer?
[07:58:23] <khmer> i handrolled a model
[07:58:30] <khmer> and a router
[07:58:47] <khmer> and we don't use controllers because on the client side they basically function as undifferentiated procedural codebuckets
[07:58:52] <khmer> and we try to stay more declarative
[07:59:22] <khmer> for views we're using knockout where we need things to be whitelabeled and super easy for a third party to read and understand
[07:59:34] <khmer> and for when performance is more important, we're rendering templates serverside and pushing them as html
[08:03:35] <gho5t> "whitelabeled" ?
[08:03:38] <gho5t> haven't heard that term
[08:03:47] <gho5t> I'm assuming you mean intuitive?
[08:04:11] <khmer> oh i just mean, code that third parties will extend, modify, brand as their own
[08:04:33] <khmer> white labeling means creating a product that you expect to be sold or distributed under many different brand names, publicly
[08:04:51] <gho5t> ah
[08:04:51] <BillCriswell> gho5t: It's like putting your logo on something to make it seem like its yours.
[08:08:10] <khmer> yes
[08:08:12] <khmer> think google apps
[08:14:44] <devicenull> so I'm fairly confused.  I'm doing $.post('https://www.example.com') , but jquery is instead trying to post to http://www.example.com
[08:15:34] <tw2113> you're passing that in as the url to post to devicenull
[08:15:40] <tw2113> not as the url to post
[08:15:56] <tw2113> or data to post
[08:16:21] <devicenull> sorry, I'm not sure what you're saying
[08:16:32] <tw2113> i believe the first parameter is where to send the data
[08:16:35] <tw2113> if i'm not mistaken
[08:16:38] <devicenull> correct
[08:16:58] <tw2113> isn't that what it's doing?
[08:18:04] <[E]sc> i'm using ajax formdata to upload a file dynamically via ajax on a form input box but when i click on the cancel, or opening the input box to change to another file, it will upload the number of times the upload was canceled or changed.  i tried using new formData to reset however that doesn't work either;  Any suggestions on how to fix that?
[08:18:10] <devicenull> bah
[08:18:19] <devicenull> my remote page was redirecting to the non-https version
[08:18:26] <devicenull> and that redirect wasn't showing up in chrome :/
[08:23:59] <cdent> Anybody know if the there is a new home for http://malsup.github.io/jquery.form.js ? The github repo is showing as being turned private yesterday.
[08:25:23] <tw2113> maybe it's just a temp thing
[08:25:53] <cdent> certainly possible
[08:26:21] <cdent> i've got a build process that pulls in the latest from raw.github and it's now doing 404, guess I'll just switch to the above uri
[08:29:33] <phrearch> hey
[08:29:51] <phrearch> somehow, e.preventDefault doesnt work with a delegate for me
[08:30:29] <phrearch> any idea whats wrong with http://paste.kde.org/p2b7ab5e7/
[08:30:45] <fRAiLtY-> What is this var actually "doing" var $fake_button_with_notice = $('<button id="zetaprints-fake-add-to-cart-button"' + 'class="button btn-cart" type="button"' + 'title="' + title + '">' + '<span><span>' + title + '</span></span>' + '</button>');
[08:31:23] <NoiseEee> fRAiLtY-: creating a <button> element
[08:31:41] <fRAiLtY-> Is it possible, in the same var, to inject some html into a div that already exists?
[08:32:00] <fRAiLtY-> for example $('mydiv').html('blah');
[08:32:12] <fRAiLtY-> But within that var
[08:32:27] <NoiseEee> fRAiLtY-: not that way, you'd need to append a new element to the div with the content you want
[08:39:36] <Fauve> Hello people !
[08:40:10] <fRAiLtY-> NoiseEee:  Perhaps you can help with some advice then, http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/wedding-invitations/roses-invite-insert.html I'm using a 3rd party app (zp-personalisation-form.js) which when "update preview" is clicked, swaps the "fake" add to cart button for a real one. I want a warning to be part of that process, in the sense that if I create a div somewhere on the page it has a warning in it saying "must update preview first" then disappears (mu
[08:40:11] <fRAiLtY-> like the button element) when it is clicked
[08:40:13] <fRAiLtY-> if that makes any sense
[08:40:20] <fRAiLtY-> Hence why I wanted to tap into the button var
[08:44:08] <NoiseEee> fRAiLtY-: but that button just makes a button. you'll have to make whatever you want and append it where you want
[08:46:22] <RohanBhangui> hi guys is there a way by which one can detect the amount of time that has elapsed after a mouse has entered a div
[08:46:53] <RohanBhangui> i have some images that toggle color on mouseenter and mouseleave
[08:46:57] <fRAiLtY-> NoiseEee:  Which I could do, if I could figure out when that button is shown/hidden as I could hook into that "event"
[08:47:03] <RohanBhangui> but when i quickly run my mouse over them many times
[08:47:23] <RohanBhangui> they start to flash (which i understand it is doing)
[08:47:36] <RohanBhangui> what i need is only if the mouse is hovered over the image for a certain amount of time
[08:47:42] <RohanBhangui> then the image changes color
[08:48:13] <BillCriswell> RohanBhangui: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html this should help.
[08:48:14] <gho5t> so throttle it with setTimeout
[08:48:42] <RohanBhangui> gho5t: exmaple
[08:49:25] <RohanBhangui> BillCriswell: looks interesting, might use as last resort and way to do this without plugin?
[08:50:21] <BillCriswell> RohanBhangui: http://pastie.org/pastes/8149478/text
[08:50:29] <BillCriswell> That's some code I wrote a while ago for htat problem.
[08:50:47] <RohanBhangui> true
[08:50:52] <RohanBhangui> looking at it thanks
[08:50:59] <BillCriswell> The setTimeout second parameter is how long it would take to trigger that mouseover
[08:52:36] <gho5t> RohanBhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/xy3tz/
[08:52:37] <BillCriswell> RohanBhangui: http://jsbin.com/ubacod/2/edit Here's a clear example.
[08:52:48] <gho5t> whoops same as BillCriswell's imp pretty much
[08:52:53] <BillCriswell> Haha indeed.
[08:54:25] <gho5t> actually mine had some omissions; http://jsfiddle.net/xy3tz/1/
[08:54:58] <gho5t> dammit: http://jsfiddle.net/xy3tz/2/
[08:55:40] <BillCriswell> premature pastazation.
[08:55:45] <BillCriswell> pasteazation
[08:56:47] <gho5t> yes and then multiple fixes to something no one will ever read
[08:56:55] <gho5t> ocd to the max
[08:57:03] <BillCriswell> hahaha same here.
[08:57:08] <BillCriswell> You should see my stack overflow answers.
[08:57:18] <gho5t> LOL
[08:59:35] <RohanBhangui> BillCriswell: gho5t: thanks for your help works beautifully. One last BillCriswell: the time for how long the mouse has entered is the 2000 value right?
[08:59:55] <BillCriswell> RohanBhangui: Yes.
[09:00:08] <RohanBhangui> k thanks both of you :)
[09:00:45] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[09:32:58] <spobat> hi
[09:33:04] <spobat> how do i implement this hover event
[09:33:09] <spobat> it looks like this in css
[09:33:12] <spobat> .image-tooltip:hover span
[09:33:33] <spobat> I need some extra js functionality, so i need to catch that event in jquery
[09:34:25] <spobat> $('.image-tooltip').hover(function() {        var span = $(this).find('span');;});
[09:34:27] <spobat> like that?
[09:37:22] <gho5t> spobat: yep
[09:38:30] <spobat> ok
[09:53:50] <sl33k_> How do you handle form validations effectively with jquery? I am using native javascript and it becomes a mess for validations?
[09:54:03] <ohcibi> there are plugins to do that
[09:54:11] <FernandoBasso> I am using fancybox. Clicking on a link works the first time. If I click again, I get $.fancybox is not defined. I hope someone has seen this problem before.
[09:54:44] <sl33k_> I will search some.
[09:55:37] <sl33k_> Where do you keep your jquery files in your project? Do you mind if it becomes seen when viewing source in browser?
[09:56:26] <sl33k_> *becomes visible
[09:56:30] <ohcibi> sl33k_: assuming that you have already implemented server-side validation (which is a must as client side is easily disabled by the client), you could also validate the form by posting it to your webapp and make it return the form errors.. you then just have to render them and dont have to care about the actual validation (and you dont have to reimplement it on the client)
[09:57:02] <ohcibi> sl33k_: it must be visible because the client needs to download it as it runs on the client...
[10:01:52] <sl33k_> ohcibi: server side validations and validating the form by posting it to the webapp seems the same thing? Or am I missing something?
[10:07:51] <wolfehr> for the $.ajax() method, which is the correct callback that is triggered only when the remote request is 100% completed (complete() still seems to trigger before the remote request is done)
[10:07:55] <sl33k_> where can I view their js files for instance? view-source:http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/
[10:16:46] <wolfehr> looks like success was correct (had it before but we had another issue in code)
[11:04:30] <phrearch> hi
[11:04:51] <phrearch> how can i add multiple parameters to a custom jquery .on ?
[11:07:22] <khmer> we'll need to see an example
[11:07:52] <phrearch> ok, ill paste a fiddle. just a sec
[11:09:31] <DarkKnightCZ> hi, i have form, on submit, i want to make another http request ($.post), how do i temporarily prevent default action to be performed until that post request is handled?
[11:10:24] <munichlinux> DarkKnightCZ: yes you disable the button
[11:10:39] <munichlinux> but try to do all the stuff in one HTTP request
[11:11:26] <blinkdesign> @DarkKnightCZ Use event.preventDefault() to stop the form submitting, and then in the success callback of $.post try $('.the-form').submit()
[11:11:46] <DarkKnightCZ> munichlinux: i cannot do that in one request... disabling button prevents multiple submiting
[11:11:51] <phrearch> http://jsfiddle.net/qK3WH/4/
[11:11:54] <phrearch> something like this
[11:12:20] <phrearch> i dont mind using .emit and supplying the parameters as a list, as long they end up as param1, param2 in the event listener
[11:12:52] <phrearch> probably i should use .apply or?
[11:12:52] <mrconfused786> i'm trying $(this).index() but getting the wrong value due to my dom structure ... can you guys take a look ?
[11:12:53] <mrconfused786> http://jsfiddle.net/PYUrc/
[11:14:01] <DarkKnightCZ> blinkdesign: that will cycle... but thanks for kicking me up, just make "counter" outside function :)
[11:14:14] <phrearch> ow i think i already got it. jquery to the resque! :) http://jsfiddle.net/qK3WH/5/
[11:14:14] <blinkdesign> @DarkKnightCZ Cool ;)
[11:14:21] <phrearch> just needed a list
[11:14:38] <blinkdesign> @mrconfused786 Check the docs on .index(), you can pass an element (jquery object) to it to filter
[11:15:37] <shoky> DarkKnightCZ it won't "cycle"  if you $('.the-form')[0].submit()
[11:15:38] <phrearch> yep thats it
[11:15:40] <phrearch> :D
[11:15:49] <DarkKnightCZ> shoky: nice
[11:16:11] <shoky> or just  var form = this;  ..... form.submit();
[11:20:44] <mrconfused786> blinkdesign thanks
[11:26:05] <dougb> i'm having an issue in Firefox.  When I run $(this).contents().length on iframe load, it returns 1 regardless if it's the same origin or not, but in Chrome it's loading 0 if it's not the same origin, and 1 if it is the same origin which is what I was expecting in all browsers.  Is there another way to go about seeing if the contents is from the same origin?
[11:26:37] <khmer> dougb: what is the node that firefox is returning?
[11:27:21] <dougb> khmer: the node inside the iframe?
[11:27:23] <zuloyd> hi
[11:27:49] <zuloyd> is it possible to use the jquery easing plugin on arbitrary object attributes, not only for css attributes of dom elements?
[11:28:01] <zuloyd> I'd like to use it for THREE.js stuff (move the camera)
[11:29:56] <_pash> is there any way in jquery to check the original image dimensions of an image on the server?
[11:31:01] <wolfehr> why is jquery success firing before the request is complete? I'm uploading a file as part of the request, but surely it should wait for that to finish first?
[11:31:38] <gnarf> dougb: you're trying to detect if the iframe is same-origin without triggering the console warning i assume?
[11:31:49] <dougb> gnarf: yes
[11:32:07] <gnarf> dougb: there is no good method to do so
[11:32:09] <wolfehr> ajax success rather
[11:32:15] <dougb> checking 'src' doesn't help because all URL's go through a redirect
[11:32:36] <khmer> you can't even hide it in a try/catch and that's by design
[11:32:59] <khmer> lol, asm.js has a type called "intish"
[11:33:37] <snover> it is like an integer but sometimes it has a decimal
[11:34:53] <gnarf> dougb: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12381504/91914 -- thats about the best you'll get for detecting it - and it will still show the error on the console
[11:35:33] <dougb> gnarf: thanks, that should work....not too concerned about the error as long as it doesn't hault the code
[11:35:38] <mrconfused786> blinkdesign so i checked the docs http://api.jquery.com/index/
[11:35:57] <mrconfused786> http://jsfiddle.net/PYUrc/
[11:36:03] <mrconfused786> and i'm getting -1
[11:36:13] <mrconfused786> http://jsfiddle.net/PYUrc/1/
[11:36:29] <mrconfused786> blinkdesign ^
[11:37:22] <shoky> mrconfused786: read the docs carefully. you've got it backwards
[11:38:59] <mrconfused786> thanks
[11:39:01] <mrconfused786> got it
[11:39:03] <mrconfused786>     alert($("#topsellers_panel li").index($(this)));
[11:39:10] <shoky> .index(this)
[11:39:36] <mrconfused786> hmm i need to understand the diff between $(this) and this
[11:40:26] <shoky> "this" in an event handler is the element it was triggered on. $(this)  is the same element, wrapped in a jquery object
[11:40:47] <blinkdesign> @mrconfused786 This would get you the correct index, regardless of DOM structure - http://jsfiddle.net/Blink/PYUrc/2/
[11:40:58] <blinkdesign> You need to filter the elements by whichever is the current one
[11:41:01] <shoky> i didn't mean that .index($(this)) is wrong, it's just not necessary
[11:42:32] <shoky> same for $(this).attr('id')  vs  this.id
[11:42:55] <mrconfused786> got it thanks
[11:49:44] <mrconfused786> shoky looks like i needed $(this) because when i took it out
[11:49:46] <mrconfused786> it said
[11:50:07] <mrconfused786> Object #<HTMLLIElement> has no method 'attr'
[11:50:40] <shoky> mrconfused786:  i didn't tell you to do  this.attr('id')
[11:50:50] <shoky> this.id
[11:51:32] <mrconfused786> sorry! need to learn to slow down and read better!
[11:52:11] <shoky> s'ok
[11:54:17] <BillCriswell> Damn, this switch statement is trying to make me feel stupid.
[11:54:20] <BillCriswell> and it's working.
[11:57:59] <drim> is it better for performance to bind an event directly on the element $('xxx').click instead or doing $(document).on('click'…. ?
[11:58:23] <tamarche> to the element I believe
[11:58:54] <gnarf> assuming that the "li"'s are the only elements in #topsellers_panel - I think $(this).index() could replace $("#topsellers_panel li").index(this)
[11:59:01] <gnarf> mrconfused786: ^
[11:59:28] <gnarf> $(elem).index() returns the number of previousSibiling's
[12:03:04] <keebler> Question: Is it typically frowned upon to perform both your POST and Display in one function?
[12:04:23] <_pash> is there any way in jquery to check the original image dimensions of an image on the server?
[12:04:26] <_pash> I am probably being very stupid, but i really cant get this to work. been breaking my head on this for an hour. http://paste.pound-python.org/show/S9Wmv7JODexuB5G3jihs/ I need to make imgWidth have the same result as pic_real_width
[12:04:39] <keebler> I have not been separating them because I want to reduce the number of lines of code and number of functions since these programs are being executed on iPhone 4's and Android 4.1 Devices.
[12:06:57] <mobile8> shoky: are you here?
[12:15:26] <perara_> Good evening, anyone here who have experience with JQM listview not updating its autodivider titles correctly. sometimes autodividers is saying 0 and 1 on titles. and other times its working correcly (ajax). its always working if i go directly without ajax.
[12:19:26] <BillCriswell> Boss just came in and started talking right in the middle of me being like 2 seconds away from understanding something. I hate when that happens.
[12:25:30] <jody_lognoul> Hi
[12:27:40] <_jo_> Yo.
[12:53:17] <lhunath> is there a utility to easily modify query parameters of a URL?  eg. http://a/b?c=d  and do something like url.setQuery("c", "e")
[12:56:06] <KelVarnsen> can i remove all select options that have a value greater than 100?
[12:56:16] <KelVarnsen> im doing this         $("select[id$='test'] option[value='102']").remove();
[12:56:29] <KelVarnsen> and it removes 102 but i need 103 104 etc
[12:58:19] <tamarche> KelVarnsen:  Something like this: $('select[id$='test'] option').each(function() {    if($(this).val() > 100{ $(this).remove()}});
[12:58:31] <KelVarnsen> awesome
[12:58:35] <KelVarnsen> thank you!
[13:02:53] <shoky> mobile8: now yea
[13:12:03] <guideX> is there a reason why data in ie8 looks like this .. [["Jdkdkdksn", "Last Updated: 4/13/2012", "Bdhd"]] and in other browsers looks like this ["Jdkdkdksn", "Last Updated: 4/13/2012", "Bdhd"]
[13:12:19] <guideX> or a way to correct it
[13:17:16] <BillCriswell> guideX: I hope IE wouldn't just wrap an array into an array.
[13:17:27] <guideX> oic
[13:18:09] <BillCriswell> guideX: I'm think it's just how it's displayed? Try the .length
[13:18:16] <guideX> the length differs too
[13:18:25] <guideX> in ie8, the length is 1, in others it's 3
[13:18:26] <BillCriswell> guideX: Ah, then that's bad.
[13:18:42] <BillCriswell> guideX: Can't imagine how that got like that lol.
[13:19:11] <guideX> friggen ie lol
[13:19:17] <guideX> ok well at least the problem is more clear..
[13:19:23] <BillCriswell> Is the code public?
[13:19:34] <guideX> hmm nope, let me get the offending code
[13:19:42] <guideX> i'll paste it somewhere..
[13:25:39] <spacebarbarian> is there a way to trigger an event if CSS /style is changed on an element ?
[13:34:15] <mobile8> shoky: still here?
[13:34:21] <mobile8> shoky: you know about image maps a little?
[13:34:30] <mobile8> by any chance
[13:35:32] <shoky> mobile8: a little
[13:36:27] <mobile8> I sent you a link, I'm breaking my head over this for the past few hours ;/
[13:37:03] <mobile8> I've got an image map, the map should re-calc the coords when the browser width updates
[13:37:35] <mobile8> But it doesn't always (when you run it for the first time)
[13:37:48] <mobile8> I somehow need to force the resize trigger
[13:38:07] <mobile8> But that didnt work aswell
[13:39:13] <shoky> why re-calc?
[13:39:47] <mobile8> to make the image map responsive
[13:40:12] <mobile8> So the coords work no matter what width the image map is
[13:40:29] <shoky> yea but the image doesn't seem to be responsive
[13:40:34] <mobile8> Open it fresh (CTRL+F5) and then do F5 (normal reload)
[13:40:41] <mobile8> and you'll see what I mean
[13:40:44] <mobile8> shoky: nop indeed
[13:41:28] <mobile8> on firefox it is btw
[13:41:35] <mobile8> Just not on webkit browsers
[13:47:30] <mobile8> shoky: You see what I Mean?

[14:19:54] <mobile8> i've restored it back
[14:20:03] <tw2113> you'll also have to re-declare the index variable to use anyway
[14:20:38] <grafi> cas you even use switch statements like that?

[14:26:06] <tw2113> Bloomberg, you use one here: src.hide();
[14:26:10] <imacinto> I found one thing on JSPerf but its example seemed limited to showing the speed at which the binding happens, not the performance after the binding occurs
[14:26:21] <Bloomberg> yes
[14:28:10] <shoky> mobile8: that line could be executed before the image is loaded
[14:28:36] <shoky> mobile8: hrm nevermind
[14:28:45] <mobile8> yea
[14:28:52] <Bloomberg> tw2113: This is well?
[14:28:53] <Bloomberg> case index : "tabs-1":
[14:28:58] <Bloomberg> or case index = "tabs-1":
[14:29:44] <tw2113> how about this Bloomberg
[14:29:50] <tw2113> instead of your echo $idx
[14:29:57] <tw2113> just paste in what $idx will echo out
[14:30:05] <tw2113> and then ditch the php tag completely
[14:30:05] <Bloomberg> the switch option
[14:30:15] <tw2113> put in an example
[14:30:21] <Bloomberg> must to be case index : "tabs-1": like this or with = instead :
[14:30:52] <tw2113> because jsbin doesn't do php
[14:31:05] <mobile8> shoky: any idea?
[14:31:07] <gho5t> good for jsbin
[14:32:10] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ibadon/3/edit
[14:32:12] <grafi> now dont be mean gho5t :P
[14:32:15] <Bloomberg> And now?
[14:32:22] <gho5t> :P
[14:33:08] <tw2113> you're down to 8 warnings now
[14:33:29] <tw2113> and you once again don't have the var index defined
[14:33:59] <tw2113> actually you keep reassigning the index variable inside your switch statemen
[14:34:03] <tw2113> because of a single =
[14:34:09] <tw2113> comparisons take 2 or 3 ='s
[14:34:14] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ibadon/4/edit
[14:34:18] <Bloomberg> Once more time
[14:34:42] <tw2113> still 8 warnigns
[14:34:46] <tw2113> warnings*
[14:35:03] <grafi> i dont know why i keep opening that link :|
[14:35:18] <tw2113> warnings that shwo you're not using your case statements correct
[14:35:26] <tw2113> fuck i suck at typing right now
[14:35:41] <grafi> xÜ
[14:35:51] <tw2113> time to go visit the throne, bbl
[14:36:19] <grafi> in the game of thrones you win or you lose
[14:36:34] <tw2113> in this game of thrones, you either sit or you poo
[14:37:19] <grafi> sooo
[14:37:26] <grafi> number 2 standing up?
[14:37:28] <grafi> or what
[14:38:47] <dzarzagza> trying to make this autoplay: http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/ScrollingLayout/. What would the logic to make it work? next slider = id after current
[14:39:32] <dzarzagza> settimeout( goto next id )
[14:41:04] <shoky> mobile8: i donno, no idea what those plugins are doing really
[14:42:59] <Bloomberg> I need to do some like
[14:42:59] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/saK9d/
[14:44:18] <mobile8> shoky: recalculating the <area> coords!
[14:45:47] <shoky> mobile8: i dont understand what's going on in your page.. sometimes the image seems responsive other times not.. its containing div sometimes has the image's size but sometimes not
[14:46:05] <shoky> mobile8: and you got 2 plugins there doing stuff with the map
[14:48:07] <mobile8> shoky: no. one highlights areas, one recalcs coords
[14:49:17] <mobile8> i've corrected it, check now
[14:50:37] <shoky> corrected what? it's not loading at all now
[14:50:45] <mobile8> shoky: check now please
[14:53:27] <mobile8> shoky: see?
[14:54:02] <shoky> mobile8: it's being resized after load
[14:54:18] <shoky> seems to me to be by that maphighlight plugin, not sure though
[14:54:28] <mobile8> shoky: why do you think?
[14:54:36] <shoky> because i see it changing size
[14:54:57] <shoky> and cause when i step into the recalc plugin, it's taking the original size, not the resized one
[14:55:03] <shoky> and right afterwards, the image resizes
[14:55:19] <shoky> looking at the timeline, it seems to be cause of that setTimeout in maphilight.js
[14:55:25] <mobile8> ah yes
[14:55:25] <shoky> but really not sure
[14:55:27] <mobile8> sec
[14:55:42] <mobile8> shoky: you mean that that highlight happens later
[14:55:51] <shoky> yes
[14:56:35] <shoky> and causes a resize. it's wrapping the img with a div with different size
[14:56:38] <mobile8> shoky: see now
[14:56:39] <mobile8> yea
[14:56:44] <mobile8> shoky: i disabled the timeout
[14:56:47] <mobile8> resizing works
[14:56:52] <mobile8> highlighting works only after resize
[14:57:12] <shoky> doesnt look right, what you did
[14:57:16] <shoky> just removing the setTimeout ?
[14:57:23] <shoky> if the image is not loaded yet..
[14:57:25] <mobile8> why not?
[14:57:33] <mobile8> hmm
[14:57:37] <shoky> you're already inside the maphilight
[14:57:48] <mobile8> ok i've set it bac
[14:57:51] <shoky> you're calling it recursively.  with the setTimeout it did a return
[14:57:51] <mobile8> back
[14:57:58] <mobile8> ahh yes
[14:58:14] <shoky> if you want to disable that setTimeout thing, comment the whole thing
[14:58:22] <shoky> tho no idea if that's a good idea either
[14:59:58] <mobile8> shoky: but do you see why the maphighlight conflicts with rwdImageMaps?
[15:00:42] <shoky> not sure what you mean to ask.. like i said, it's resizing the image
[15:01:00] <mobile8> What I mean to ask is
[15:01:01] <mobile8> ehm
[15:01:07] <mobile8> In which browser do you open it?
[15:01:11] <shoky> chrome
[15:01:27] <mobile8> shoky: ok, as you see, it highlights the wrong parts, right?
[15:01:33] <shoky> yep
[15:01:47] <mobile8> and when you resize the window and maximize it, it highlights the correct parts
[15:01:50] <mobile8> right?
[15:01:58] <shoky> ya
[15:02:06] <mobile8> Any idea why this happens?
[15:02:22] <shoky> because it's resizing the image after the rwd shit already ran
[15:02:50] <mobile8> any idea how I Can solve this?
[15:03:29] <shoky> like i said, i dont fully understand what these plugins are doing and dont feel like digging into them,
[15:03:40] <shoky> but an easy fix might be to $(window).trigger('resize')   in that setTimeout
[15:03:54] <shoky> after calling img.maphilight(opts)
[15:04:16] <jhave> Hello
[15:04:38] <mobile8> shoky: rwdimagemaps recals the coords when the image width changes
[15:04:49] <shoky> no it doesn't
[15:04:54] <mobile8> shoky: that does it
[15:04:57] <mobile8> :)
[15:04:59] <shoky> it recalcs when the window resizes
[15:05:03] <mobile8> shoky: ehh sorry
[15:05:07] <mobile8> you're right
[15:05:11] <mobile8> that's what i ment though
[15:05:16] <shoky> heh k
[15:05:18] <mobile8> hehe
[15:05:46] <mobile8> shoky: this works
[15:05:48] <mobile8> but
[15:06:04] <mobile8> the issue is, that in chrome / webkit browsers the resizing to another width still won't work
[15:06:18] <mobile8> shoky: while the parent div has max-width: 1080px;
[15:06:31] <mobile8> the image has width: auto and max-width: 100%;
[15:06:35] <mobile8> the image width still is 1152
[15:07:34] <mobile8> using $(window).trigger('resize'); just resizes it to the original <img width>
[15:07:49] <shoky> i see the wrapping div also as 1152
[15:08:04] <mobile8> 1080
[15:08:12] <shoky> no matter how i resize the window. at least right now.. this behaviour seems to change every now and then
[15:08:18] <shoky> guess you're making changes donno
[15:08:36] <mobile8> shoky: I'm not now for the next 3 minutes lol
[15:08:37] <mobile8> Try now please
[15:08:38] <shoky> width:1152px  on the div
[15:08:49] <mobile8> shoky: that's the div the highlight js creates sorry yes
[15:09:07] <shoky> that's where the image takes its width from
[15:09:33] <mobile8> so i'd need to prevent this width gets set?
[15:10:31] <shoky> i dunno
[15:10:54] <chovy> does anyone use mentionsInput plugin?
[15:11:37] <mobile8> shoky: do you have any suggestions on this?
[15:13:21] <shoky> mobile8: not without digging into that plugin.. the css is simple.. <img> takes its width from its wrapping <div>.  if the <div> has width:1152px  then the img will take that
[15:13:42] <shoky> so.. if you make it so the <div> has width:100%  instead, for example.. i guess that'd do something ;p
[15:15:31] <mobile8> shoky: where?
[15:16:09] <shoky> where what?
[15:16:36] <Mac_Weber> is there anything similar to the former event 'changeData'? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6804
[15:17:23] <mobile8> shoky: set the div on 100%
[15:18:03] <shoky> mobile8: wherever its width is being set
[15:18:05] <mobile8> shoky: check now, that also doesn't work
[15:18:18] <mobile8> shoky: .maphilighted{width: 100% !important;} tried that
[15:19:12] <drager> I'm currently wonder how I would add different levels for game. http://jsfiddle.net/drager/jeYmS/ any ideas?
[15:19:53] <shoky> mobile8: that changed the <img> width too , no longer 'auto'
[15:20:52] <mobile8> shoky: doesn't matter
[15:21:03] <mobile8> oh
[15:22:20] <mobile8> shoky: but the img width or max width dont matter
[15:26:12] <shoky> mobile8: i donno man, play with it.. er i just noticed you also have the same image as background-image on the div
[15:26:36] <guideX> is there a reason ie8 can't detect undefined? if (typeof value === undefined || typeof value == undefined || value === 'undefined' || value == 'undefined') {
[15:26:39] <mobile8> shoky: the plugins do that, probably necessary
[15:26:53] <mobile8> shoky: i've played with it for ages hehe
[15:27:22] <shoky> mobile8: dunno, i'd need to dig into the plugin to see wtf its doing and why. and i really dont feel like it
[15:27:51] <shoky> cause right now the displayed image is from the <div>, not the <img>
[15:28:01] <snover> guideX: because you are comparing exactly the wrong values
[15:28:04] <shoky> so indeed the img size doesnt matter except for the map
[15:28:10] <shoky> (i guess)
[15:28:20] <guideX> snover oic
[15:28:36] <guideX> so all 4 of those are wrong eh?
[15:28:36] <mobile8> shoky: yea
[15:29:06] <mobile8> shoky: btw resizing works perfectly when i disable the image highlight
[15:29:11] <mobile8> shoky: (with working coords)
[15:29:25] <shoky> make your own highlighter :P
[15:30:12] <mobile8> hehe how :)
[15:30:26] <snover> guideX: yes. all of them are wrong. unless you want to know if value is the string value undefined, then only two of them are wrong.
[15:30:27] <shoky> step by step
[15:30:40] <mobile8> shoky: see now
[15:30:43] <mobile8> in chrome
[15:30:50] <mobile8> or ff or wherever
[15:31:16] <shoky> yah
[15:31:26] <mobile8> this is good right?
[15:31:27] <guideX> snover hmm.. none of those are working in ie8.. do you know the correct syntax?
[15:31:55] <shoky> mobile8: if it's how you want it to be.. then it's good ye :p
[15:32:21] <mobile8> shoky: i need the highlighting aswell :(
[15:32:32] <shoky> yap
[15:32:45] <guideX> I also tried if(!value) {
[15:33:23] <mobile8> shoky: what would you do
[15:34:28] <snover> guideX: think about what you are trying to do
[15:34:31] <shoky> mobile8: donno, i'd play around with it more and if i cant get it, i'd try to make my own highlighter, i suppose
[15:34:31] <mobile8> I me an isn't there a way to draw something based on  the coords
[15:34:54] <guideX> i'm trying to not do something if it's undefined
[15:35:14] <guideX> I find that it's undefined by hovering over it in the debugger and seeing     undefined
[15:35:25] <mobile8> shoky: you don't have time to look in jquery.maphilight.js for 1 sec :)) ?
[15:35:33] <guideX> or by letting it blow up then I get a ie8 error
[15:35:37] <shoky> mobile8: or i'd dig into the highlighter you have to figure out how/if  i can use it to suit my needs
[15:36:00] <shoky> mobile8: for 1 sec ya but it'd take more than that. and i'm goin afk for a bit now ;p
[15:36:19] <mobile8> damn ok
[15:37:07] <mobile8> line 243 is probably the issue
[15:42:06] <drager> I'm currently wonder how I would add different levels for game. http://jsfiddle.net/drager/44jjd/ ideas?
[15:56:11] <epicowl> how could I modify chosen liszt:updated to not show preselected options in the dropdown?
[15:56:21] <epicowl> right now they show as greyed out but I want them to not show up at all
[16:04:23] <WG1337> How could I get <div> height in an inframe?
[16:19:39] <chovy> WG1337: if i'm not mistaken, you can't acess iframe   innarrds
[16:49:09] <fesener_> hi everyone, i have a loop like this: $(".radiant_box").children().each(function(){ ... } , how can I change this so it exludes the children which has has popover class ?
[16:55:09] <shoky> fesener_: $(".radiant_box").children().not('.popover').each(...
[16:56:09] <fesener_> it worked shoky thank you so much
[18:41:06] <wroathe> exit
[18:59:55] <zubelgenubi> easy question hopefully: How can I use the json data here? http://tech.goldenrulecomfort.com/proj/project/projectlist
[19:00:36] <Al1> @zubelgenubi what exactly are you tryin to do with it?
[19:00:40] <zubelgenubi> like if select is changed to a number, fill in job name and general contractor fields with info from the array?
[19:00:50] <zubelgenubi> that matches the id selected
[19:01:55] <Al1> sorting by ID?
[19:02:35] <zubelgenubi> yeah well the json is basically from an sql query, id is the primary key
[19:05:13] <acidjazz> your moms a primary key
[19:08:21] <zubelgenubi> this is where I am so far...   http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWfG/
[19:22:28] <Al1> you can parse out the json and use some jquery plugin to sort through data and etc
[19:24:59] <zubelgenubi> you mean like iterate through the json and build objects bit by bit?
[19:26:05] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: $.parseJSON() http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[19:26:32] <zubelgenubi> k...
[19:28:47] <zubelgenubi> OK got that part. Next is how to select name element in row where id=2
[19:31:56] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: depends. did you show some example data?
[19:32:43] <zubelgenubi> sure here http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWfG/3/
[19:33:17] <zubelgenubi> So toward the bottom of my js, I know projectlist.customername.value is not right, but I'm not sure what it should be
[19:35:42] <doug65536> look at http://tech.goldenrulecomfort.com/proj/project/projectlist
[19:35:47] <doug65536> it's not customername, it's name
[19:36:47] <zubelgenubi> oh, is that the only problem?
[19:36:59] <doug65536> also, it doesn't make sense to say projectlist.value
[19:37:31] <doug65536> do you use firebug?
[19:37:35] <pixelpimp> projectilevomit.hrglblrhlarghbll
[19:37:54] <zubelgenubi> well im in chrome now but I can open ff
[19:38:48] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: projectlist is a local variable, it's not accessible outside the anonymous method
[19:40:20] <zubelgenubi> I guess that's what I'm struggling with..  how to access the name property of the record with an id that matches the select value
[19:41:07] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: your code is not valid, press jshint button at the top
[19:41:18] <doug65536> you didn't close the final brace and parenthesis and semicolon
[19:44:14] <Davey> hrm, I want to create a complex module; that will define multiple $.fn.<foo> methods, as well have it's own init and such to setup the module — anyone know of an example of this?
[19:44:19] <zubelgenubi> ah, ok.   well I just copied that section from my ide.      didnt get it all
[19:44:27] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: your code does not wait for the json response to come back
[19:44:42] <Davey> the module doesn't get called on DOM elements, it's just called from the global scope
[19:45:29] <zubelgenubi> http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWfG/7/ ok now its valid, but still not sure how to access the projectlist name property for the record with an id property that matches the select field...
[19:46:26] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: projectlist is not accessible in the change event. the var keyword in the getjson anonymous method makes it a local var
[19:48:07] <zubelgenubi> oh...
[19:48:57] <zubelgenubi> hm I don't want to get the ajax every time the select changes...
[19:49:07] <zubelgenubi> can I just make it global?
[19:49:27] <zubelgenubi> I mean public...    ok
[19:49:42] <doug65536> yes... I'm trying to figure out why the getJSON anonymous method never runs
[19:50:06] <doug65536> json documentation site is timing out for me
[19:50:12] <doug65536> jquery*
[19:54:07] <zubelgenubi> yeah its down
[19:56:57] <shoky> ?down api.jquery.com
[19:56:57] <b-ot> shoky: It's just you. http://api.jquery.com is up! (200 OK)
[19:57:17] <doug65536> it's up now
[20:02:15] <doug65536> whats going on with jsfiddle, I cant select text, the selection instantly disappears
[20:02:49] <Al1> anyone familiar with this plugin - http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ ?
[20:02:49] <acidjazz> its shit
[20:02:51] <acidjazz> use codepen
[20:03:07] <acidjazz> Al1: yes dont use that
[20:03:24] <Al1> @acidjazz - why not?
[20:03:32] <Al1> what would you suggest?
[20:03:39] <acidjazz> Al1: http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/
[20:03:45] <acidjazz> it rules all
[20:03:53] <Al1> hmmm very nice
[20:04:10] <acidjazz> use that classic theme
[20:04:11] <acidjazz> top right
[20:04:25] <pixelpimp> who ever thought javascript could get you a date
[20:04:39] <acidjazz> major sites like facebook pixelpimp
[20:04:51] <acidjazz> all dates/etc shown are js
[20:04:52] <doug65536> jquery ui has a very nice date picker
[20:05:04] <Al1> interesting plugin - thank you - definitley going to check it out
[20:05:06] <pixelpimp> -_-
[20:05:06] <acidjazz> you have like <abbr data-stamp="2093832094">Date Loading..</abbr>
[20:05:14] <acidjazz> and js will throw in the date
[20:05:33] <acidjazz> that way timezone/etc doesnt matter.. and updating time diffs like 5m 6s ago is easy
[20:05:47] <acidjazz> pixelpimp: check this out
[20:05:50] <doug65536> http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[20:05:57] <pixelpimp> you do realize that was a joke, right? :P
[20:06:04] <acidjazz> pixelpimp: https://gist.github.com/acidjazz/6026407
[20:06:33] <doug65536> I don't know what that other site was, just throwing it out there that jquery ui has good date picker
[20:06:45] <Al1> @acidjazz any recommendations on inline editing? i've come  across http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/ and http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[20:07:38] <acidjazz> pixelpimp: so any <abbr class="timestamp" datas-stamp="230942039"> loading</abbr> will get sweet dates
[20:08:00] <pixelpimp> well that's cool and all, but irrelevant to my joke ;P
[20:08:04] <acidjazz> Al1: id write that yourself.. no need to complicate
[20:08:09] <acidjazz> pixelpimp: i know but still cool
[20:08:33] <Pavlov> I've got a little day picker bar (S M T W T F S) where each day can be clicked in to.. I'd like to make it possible to swipe it left to go back a week, or swipe it right to go forward, stopping whenever the week contains today.  Anyone know of any code that does something similar I could look at to figure out how to do the sliding/snapping part?
[20:08:57] <Al1> @acidjazz thanks
[20:09:14] <Al1> the timepicker plugin u gave a link for - can time range be done with it?
[20:09:26] <doug65536> Pavlov: why waste time reinventing the wheel, use jquery ui
[20:09:46] <pixelpimp> i use iscroll
[20:10:06] <Pavlov> doug65536: how would you do that in jquery ui?
[20:10:09] <pixelpimp> good, lightweight
[20:10:32] <Pavlov> i don't want a calendar date picker
[20:10:40] <ner0x> How do I join an array into a string?
[20:10:59] <doug65536> Pavlov: you want gesture inputs for touchscreen right?
[20:11:06] <pixelpimp> array.join()
[20:11:20] <Pavlov> doug65536: i specifically need to have 1 week showing with some info in boxes for each day
[20:11:24] <ner0x> pixelpimp: See that's what I thought... Not working. Mind if I get a paste?
[20:11:35] <Pavlov> and then to be able to swipe left/right and have it move a week
[20:11:49] <pixelpimp> sure, put it up in a pastebin
[20:12:04] <ner0x> pixelpimp: I gisted it. https://gist.github.com/fswitalski/6026442
[20:12:28] <ner0x> pixelpimp: Line 146-150  150 causes the error.
[20:13:28] <pixelpimp> oh man, i don't even know what this is :P
[20:13:35] <doug65536> Pavlov: here's a jquery plugin for gesture input
[20:13:38] <doug65536> Pavlov: http://jgestures.codeplex.com/
[20:14:00] <ner0x> pixelpimp: CoffeeScript but! the map feature should be simple enough for it to work. Odd it isn't.
[20:14:09] <pradeep> Hi, please help on this
[20:14:17] <zubelgenubi> doug65536: Can I store the array somewhere hidden in the dom, and then access it from the other function?
[20:14:17] <pixelpimp> seems like it'd make sense, but i don't know the language enough to be sure...
[20:14:31] <Pavlov> doug65536: i guess i'm more curious about how i'd do structure the html to do what i want
[20:14:43] <Pavlov> should I just have 3 weeks worth of stuff, and allow swiping back and forth?
[20:14:50] <Pavlov> and center the middle one, or something?
[20:18:41] <zubelgenubi> hmm I'm getting 301 moved permanently when accessing url through ajax, but works fine in the browser. Maybe has something to do with my url redirection?
[20:19:02] <zubelgenubi> http://tech.goldenrulecomfort.com/proj/project/projectlist
[20:19:11] <acidjazz> Al1: yes i did time range w/ it theres a sample
[20:19:36] <ner0x> pixelpimp: https://gist.github.com/fswitalski/6026442  I've parsed it into regular JS for you.
[20:19:48] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: your json request receives an error 301, moved permanently. what's going on there?
[20:20:36] <zubelgenubi> yeah...    I'm using codeigniter url redirection.  Maybe that???
[20:20:59] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: as far as I can tell, the getJSON function never gets called
[20:21:13] <doug65536> the function (result) function
[20:21:37] <zubelgenubi> well right because it never has a successful 'get'
[20:21:47] <zubelgenubi> need to figure out this redirect problem...
[20:22:20] <zubelgenubi> I'll go ask in #codeigniter
[20:22:40] <shoky> doug65536: it triggers the error handler
[20:23:16] <Al1> @acidjazz - thank you and will try it
[20:24:27] <shoky> zubelgenubi doug65536  because of the www.
[20:24:56] <doug65536> shoky: yep that was it
[20:25:16] <zubelgenubi> Wow thank you!
[20:25:50] <acidjazz> Al1: http://pastebin.com/a7VkmHEE
[20:26:32] <shoky> zubelgenubi and now it doesn't work because of cross-domain SOP issue
[20:26:36] <acidjazz> that should do it
[20:30:37] <zubelgenubi> Well accessing it thru my domain, i'm getting a syntax error - JSON.parse: unexpected character.
[20:30:48] <zubelgenubi> The JSON was made with PHP JSONencode...
[20:31:29] <shoky> zubelgenubi:  getJSON already parses it for you. don't try to parse the response
[20:32:06] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: can you post your latest fiddler link?
[20:32:28] <zubelgenubi> im at http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWfG/20/
[20:32:45] <shoky> result is already parsed
[20:32:49] <zubelgenubi> but like shoky pointed out, don't think the getjson will work from firebug's domain
[20:33:01] <zubelgenubi> i mean fiddle's domain
[20:33:06] <shoky> and.. that whole fiddle is wrong
[20:33:11] <zubelgenubi> ok so no need to parse..
[20:33:45] <zubelgenubi> so two questions: 1) how to store the array from the getjson function so that my select.change function can see it
[20:34:01] <zubelgenubi> and 2) how to select the name property of the row with id property equal to select value
[20:34:38] <shoky> zubelgenubi: 1)  http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWfG/21/
[20:35:07] <shoky> (for example)
[20:36:03] <doug65536> shoky: that solves the race condition issue, but projectlist.value doesn't make sense, it is an array of "rows"
[20:36:23] <shoky> i didn't look at the actual JSON
[20:36:33] <shoky> just showing how to work with ajax
[20:36:40] <doug65536> yes I know
[20:36:55] <zubelgenubi> ok I see where you're going with this
[20:37:35] <doug65536> shoky: your suggestion also solves the scope issue with storage of the result
[20:37:44] <zubelgenubi> yeah it does
[20:38:21] <zubelgenubi> but for now, at least, the fields are not disabling anymore like in /20
[20:38:26] <doug65536> shoky: so 'done' will fire the callback every time if the result is ready?
[20:38:33] <doug65536> already ready
[20:38:56] <shoky> yeap
[20:39:02] <shoky> zubelgenubi:  2)  http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWfG/22/
[20:39:13] <shoky> donno where that .job is coming from so i commented that :P
[20:40:10] <zubelgenubi> ha ok
[20:40:11] <acidjazz> UR MOM
[20:41:11] <zubelgenubi> job is another property in the record, along with id and name
[20:41:23] <shoky> not in your example json. but if so, then uncomment ;P
[20:42:22] <zubelgenubi> oh you are right
[20:44:23] <zubelgenubi> http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWfG/23/ this is how it should have been.
[20:44:24] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: the jsonRequest is still an error
[20:44:36] <zubelgenubi> yeah let me put it in my live site and see if it works
[20:44:44] <zubelgenubi> maybe the crossdomain issue
[20:44:50] <shoky> yeah ^
[20:45:20] <shoky> in chrome it shows this in console:  XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://tech.goldenrulecomfort.com/proj/project/projectlist. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[20:45:28] <shoky> donno why firefox doesn't warn anything about it
[20:45:35] <doug65536> weird: statusText = "error", status = 0
[20:45:39] <acidjazz> shoky: thats xhr
[20:45:47] <shoky> acidjazz: wat?
[20:45:56] <acidjazz> shoky: do you use any plugin w/ FF that allows cross-site xmlhttpr?
[20:46:05] <shoky> nope
[20:46:12] <acidjazz> you cant as shoky.com do a get on bob.com in JS
[20:46:17] <shoky> i know..
[20:46:22] <acidjazz> otherwise id take you to acidjazz.com and do a get on facebook.com grab your cookies
[20:46:31] <shoky> i know what SOP is
[20:46:50] <shoky> i just didn't understand why firefox isn't warning that there is a SOP issue
[20:46:58] <shoky> chrome does
[20:47:05] <acidjazz> are u in firebug
[20:47:08] <shoky> ye
[20:47:15] <doug65536> acidjazz: my ff firebug console doesn't report any problem but the getJSON result has error status
[20:47:17] <shoky> it shows  200 OK for the request
[20:47:23] <shoky> but no response content
[20:47:45] <shoky> and the XHR does fail. but with no way that i see to figure out why
[20:48:53] <acidjazz> hmm
[20:49:53] <shoky> 200 OK  and it's red
[20:50:13] <doug65536> shoky: that is weird isn't it
[20:50:36] <shoky> yeah. use chrome ;D
[20:50:54] <acidjazz> i still love ff over chrome
[20:50:57] <acidjazz> but yea that scuks
[20:51:05] <acidjazz> chrome > firefox but firebug > chrome debug
[20:51:19] <shoky> you mean the other way around no?
[20:51:28] <Pavlov> dev tools in firefox nightlies are mostly better than chrome
[20:51:29] <doug65536> chrome sucks if you have ssd. it obsessively spams writes (with flush) to some irrelevant cache stuff
[20:52:12] <doug65536> if you trace disk I/O you will see a nearly constant stream of I/O writes from chrome
[20:52:22] <zubelgenubi> shoky and doug, it's working now, thank you so much
[20:52:40] <zubelgenubi> funny quirk tho..
[20:53:05] <zubelgenubi> first time the form opens on any browser, the js doesn't affect one field, but it does the other
[20:53:08] <doug65536> we can thank all the malicious people for ruining the fun of web development :)
[20:53:53] <zubelgenubi> the first field in the form, #customer, doesn't get disabled or enabled, till I refresh the page
[20:53:58] <zubelgenubi> then they both work!
[20:54:30] <shoky> zubelgenubi: it'll only do anything on the 'change' event, no?
[20:54:39] <shoky> the way you have it in the fiddle
[20:55:03] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: you should initialize the form fields at the top
[20:55:19] <zubelgenubi> yeah, and on change the #job field works, but the #customer field doesnt
[20:56:30] <zubelgenubi> doug, do you mean in the html?
[20:57:11] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: that or right after the getJSON call
[20:58:53] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: depends, can you create new records with that form? what would submit do
[20:59:18] <doug65536> zubelgenubi: just pointing out that you might need some handling of the initial state
[20:59:46] <zubelgenubi> yeah the form creates new PO records. Post handled by php
[21:00:08] <zubelgenubi> so like you mean setting the inital value when the page opens, to '' for example
[21:00:43] <shoky> zubelgenubi: what's the problem again?
[21:01:34] <zubelgenubi> it's strange - the first time i open the form in the browser, one field works but the other doesnt
[21:01:39] <zubelgenubi> when I refresh, both work
[21:01:41] <shoky> "works" ?
[21:02:00] <zubelgenubi> yeah, enabling/disabling/value changing to json data
[21:02:37] <shoky> can you show your current code
[21:03:15] <zubelgenubi> it's same as what's in your fiddle for the most part
[21:03:56] <zubelgenubi> but its a jquery mobile site so I have to put the code in $(document).delegate function for the page id
[21:04:33] <zubelgenubi> so it initializes when the page is loaded thru ajax
[21:04:37] <zubelgenubi> maybe that's the issue...
[21:05:57] <zubelgenubi> but its strange that it only affects one field and not the other
[21:06:11] <shoky> so.. can you show your current code ;p
[21:06:30] <zubelgenubi> ha ok
[21:06:37] <doug65536> shoky: I think he's hesitant because he's moved it to the real site...
[21:06:42] <shoky> cause it works fine in the fiddle  http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWfG/24/
[21:06:51] <zubelgenubi> yeah i did, but I'll paste my js file
[21:07:38] <zubelgenubi> http://pastebin.com/bwi07hgB
[21:07:45] <zubelgenubi> its toward the end
[21:09:29] <zubelgenubi> the html is a little more tricky, but the form is the same as that fiddle
[21:10:52] <shoky> adunno
[21:11:07] <zubelgenubi> hm ok
[21:12:00] <zubelgenubi> its gotta be ajax loading of the page. I can force it to retrieve the page normally
[21:12:28] <zubelgenubi> pretty lame tho
[21:12:44] <shoky> got a live link?
[21:13:06] <zubelgenubi> well, no
[21:13:15] <shoky> oks
[22:58:17] <groundup> I am trying to use jQuery validate with Bootstrap. I can get popovers working with some of the tutorials but then I find out I have errors.
[22:58:22] <groundup> So it doesn't work
[23:01:22] <danheberden> groundup i'm not the most knowledgeable about jQuery or Bootstrap, but perhaps sharing those errors or maybe making a succinct, pointed demo of your problem on jsbin.com would help people help you?
[23:02:02] <groundup> Good point. I will have to pull out all of the extraneous stuff from the form
[23:02:44] <danheberden> It's funny, groundup , but most of the time when I isolate the problem away for an example, i figure out what was causing it :p
[23:05:09] <tw2113> sup danheberden
[23:05:14] <danheberden> hey tw2113
[23:05:18] <danheberden> how you doin'?
[23:05:25] <tw2113> can't complain, still employed
[23:05:34] <tw2113> reading up on semantics3 api
[23:05:44] <danheberden> light reading?
[23:05:51] <tw2113> client reading more like
[23:05:57] <tw2113> we need to replace google shopping
[23:05:57] <danheberden> cleading
[23:06:30] <danheberden> sounds like an undertaking
[23:06:39] <danheberden> are they a payment gateway as well?
[23:06:57] <tw2113> https://www.semantics3.com
[23:07:28] <danheberden> it doesn't look like it from the website; was curious of super hidden features
[23:07:48] <tw2113> pretty much we need it as a product search engine
[23:08:04] <tw2113> we send it upc/mpn codes, it returns product data for us to use and display
[23:09:23] <tw2113> including merchants selling the product
[23:10:07] <tw2113> they return json, so you know they're classy
[23:15:30] <CapMax> hi, how do i select an input field by name?
[23:16:12] <CapMax> if i do "input[name=entity_type]", it will always return its default value for some reason with val()
[23:16:14] <CapMax> this is a radio btw
[23:19:02] <CapMax> anyone?
[23:19:50] <CapMax> it picks up the first value as opposed to the one which is selected
[23:20:43] <tw2113> http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[23:24:18] <miCSu> I got the elements with colon in nodename work in modern browsers but is there a fix to also get it work in like ie7 ?
[23:24:50] <miCSu> ie7 doesn't recognize $(content).find("ri\\:attachment") etc
[23:28:43] <miCSu> hm, that's odd.. it takes the last part from element name split by colon as an nodename
[23:49:47] <gzip> jquery <3
