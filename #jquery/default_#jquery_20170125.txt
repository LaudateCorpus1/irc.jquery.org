[01:47:15] <Captain_Ramius> Hey guys.
[03:34:37] <jay2010> jquery callback
[04:53:28] <Nye> Hello, I have a slightly weird problem. I am forced to use jQuery v1.10 and when I open a dropdown the very first time.. it flies in. Every click afterwards it doesnt do it. With jQuery 3 the problem doesnt occure. How do I debug this? I sadly can't show it.
[06:35:41] <robsco> i have a site using jquery 3.1.1 - i include a file containing it, then include another file and try to do $(document).ready() in the 2nd file, but chrome complains that $ is not defined.  i did this on another site with jquery 2.4.1 and it works fine.  did something change that I'm perhaps not aware of?
[07:01:47] <TheWild> hello
[07:02:41] <TheWild> in AJAX: last response may not be necessarily for last request. Does jQuery have a mechanism to handle that?
[07:07:24] <robsco> TheWild, how do you mean exactly?
[07:08:14] <TheWild> the order of request and order of responses may not match. For example: I have a text field and on every typed letter a request is performed to obtain results.
[07:08:46] <robsco> but you associate a hand;lr for each request/response, so it doesn't matter what order they come back in, that's the whole point of ajax
[07:09:08] <TheWild> Last response may come before previous, which lagged a bit.
[07:09:56] <robsco> yeah, again, that's how asynchronous calls work
[07:09:59] <robsco> that's the nature of ajax
[07:11:37] <TheWild> I know how async works
[07:12:07] <TheWild> I was fixing that problem on my own, sending a timestamp (or something random) with last request to server and expecting the same value back with response to ensure that the last response (answer) was for last request (question).
[07:12:15] <TheWild> Maybe jQuery can do it on its own?
[07:22:32] <carpii> im trying to prevent this textarea from sutoselecting a word when you right click (since I am showing a popup menu).. https://jsfiddle.net/uzaefkxe/
[07:22:36] <carpii> any help please?
[07:32:17] <jerit> isn't the autoselect a built in thing the browser does?
[07:32:32] <carpii> yeah i think youre right, was hoping to be able to handle it though
[07:33:03] <carpii> it may even be an OSX thing
[07:34:14] <jerit> maybe an osx thing because it doesn't select anything when I click in it
[07:34:30] <carpii> when you right click on a word?
[07:48:31] <jerit> when I right click in the textbox nothing happens
[07:48:44] <carpii> ok, it must be OSX. thankyou
[08:32:41] <jtoy> guys I have an animation question. I am putting a class that gives an element an absolute position on the screen to the left. I know I can't animate an absolute positioning, so what would be the easiest way to animate this item If I know where i want to place it
[08:33:25] <DelphiWorld> hey jQueryers
[08:34:06] <DelphiWorld> i have a plugin that parce rss, and having this function:      TitleLinkTarget:'_blank'
[08:34:27] <DelphiWorld> how to open that target into a modal window?
[08:51:32] <dglambert> yo
[09:31:26] <MassDebates> I'm setting up an email campaign generator for myself. this is going to be v2. I'm having trouble troubleshooting a handlebars helper. It's very very simple - takes a 2-word (first/last name) string from a JSON file and pulls the first initial with the last name. When I render it, it renders nothing!
[09:31:31] <MassDebates> https://www.pastery.net/rkdsum/ here's that helper file. it's named makeEmail.js
[09:31:55] <MassDebates> Probably not the cleanest, but I've torn it down and thrown in alternatives for about 4-5 cycles now, seeing if it's something I did wrong with the code.
[09:32:15] <MassDebates> The thing is, it works on tryhandlebarsjs.com but not on my localhost project. Other facets of handelbars are functional.
[09:49:17] <elit3x> I have a simple form that I am using jquery validator on. The validation is working, and returning a message div when the value is incorrect, but it does nto disable the submit button. Whats the easiest way to stop the form from submitting if the value does not pass the validator? https://jsfiddle.net/qu1uudqL/2/
[09:49:53] <elit3x> i dont know whats wrong, but the message div is not appearing in the fiddle, so bad example but its the same code :(
[09:56:13] <DelphiWorld> i want to have a link to be opened in a modal window... anyone?
[10:02:15] <MikeD_> DelphiWorld: what have you tried?
[10:02:34] <DelphiWorld> MikeD_: want to see my code?
[10:02:50] <MikeD_> sure
[10:03:08] <DelphiWorld> MikeD_: but i will give you a direct url, due to my inability to use jsfiddle
[10:03:13] <DelphiWorld> screen reader's issue
[10:04:04] <MikeD_> do you have a blind-accessible IDE?
[10:04:23] <DelphiWorld> MikeD_: simply notpad++ ;)
[10:04:28] <MikeD_> i realize that's not really on-topic, but it's fascinating to me
[10:04:39] <DelphiWorld> thanks MikeD_
[10:07:13] <DelphiWorld> mike__, i'm uploading it to a webserver
[10:07:28] <MikeD_> i use pair-programming with a junior dev and I have some difficulty explaining what I want him to type and where...
[10:08:00] <DelphiWorld> i see
[10:08:12] <MikeD_> i guess you are extra careful with how your build/test/tweak cycles are done because switching context is (or can be) more expensive
[10:09:21] <MikeD_> oh... sorry for assuming "screen reader" meant lack of sight
[10:14:26] <MikeD_> gah
[10:16:09] * DelphiWorld is back, MikeD_
[10:16:18] <MikeD_> :)
[10:16:27] <DelphiWorld> electricity was off
[10:17:08] <DelphiWorld> MikeD_: url in pm ;)
[10:19:34] <jerit> MikeD_: I got my transition done -> http://www.loganyoung.za.net
[10:19:51] <DelphiWorld> south affrica...
[10:19:56] <jerit> problem is it looks exactly the same as the MDL "waterfall" header transition that I replaced
[10:20:15] <jerit> DelphiWorld: I'm not proud of it but you can't choose where you're born :/
[10:20:35] <DelphiWorld> jerit: would you exchange your house with mine?
[10:20:43] <DelphiWorld> i wish to be in cap town!
[10:20:52] <jerit> I'm not in cape town either
[10:22:06] <DelphiWorld> brothers if someone help me fix my code would be glad...
[10:23:19] <DelphiWorld> this is my js code parcing a rss feed using rss2json api: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23863657/
[10:23:58] <MikeD_> ok, so you literally mean you want those links to open ... but the modal window part is a little strange for that kind of list of links
[10:24:14] <DelphiWorld> no no MikeD_
[10:24:19] <DelphiWorld> i will explain my need
[10:24:26] <DelphiWorld> that item have title and content
[10:25:02] <DelphiWorld> i dont want to open the news link, but want to create a link with title and target my modal, then display the item content in that modal
[10:25:03] <DelphiWorld> got it?
[10:26:12] <DelphiWorld> here's a example rss feed object: https://rss2json.com/#rss_url=http%3A%2F%2Fhosted2.ap.org%2Fatom%2FAPDEFAULT%2Faa9398e6757a46fa93ed5dea7bd3729e
[10:26:13] <MikeD_> have you ever seen any site using the technique you are describing?
[10:26:30] <DelphiWorld> MikeD_, this is a mobile app :P
[10:26:48] <DelphiWorld> MikeD_: did you ever understand my needs?
[10:27:00] <MikeD_> yeah, i think so
[10:27:10] <MikeD_> i'm not understanding the use-case for it though
[10:27:21] <DelphiWorld> the use case is for a mobile app
[10:27:22] <MikeD_> i generally hate modal windows
[10:27:39] <DelphiWorld> the news is in home page, then open a dialog for each news with sharing buttons
[10:27:53] <DelphiWorld> this is a news reader :)
[10:30:46] <MikeD_> https://jqueryui.com/dialog/ or http://jquerymodal.com/
[10:31:02] <MikeD_> https://www.sitepoint.com/14-jquery-modal-dialog-boxes/
[10:31:13] <DelphiWorld> ok, and how to get the clicked link to the modal and display the rss?
[10:31:49] <MikeD_> i guess it would depend on which implementation of modal window plugin you select
[10:32:05] <DelphiWorld> i dont think...
[10:32:09] <bjsnider> how do i escape double-quotes? it's echoing the backslash
[10:32:43] <MikeD_> in the case of the jquerymodal.com example, it's pretty much when you are writing the list of links you'd have rel="modal:open" added to the html
[10:33:23] <MikeD_> hmm... i guess you could use an iframe inside the div you make pop up
[10:33:33] <MikeD_> so maybe the answer is "iframe" is what you're after
[10:34:02] <MikeD_> or write your <a> tags with a target property pointed to a named window that you've already opened?
[10:44:08] <DelphiWorld> MikeD_: i found example using bs: http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/modal/
[10:44:12] <WG1337> Hi! I receive HTML data from ajax GET. How can I itter trough the received data? $(data.("#stend_box_iface_"+id)).each(function(index) <--- what is the proper syntax?
[10:58:01] <FilipNortic_> WG1337:  no thats for iterating dom elements and even then it's broken
[10:58:54] <FilipNortic_> do you want to iterate through it after you added it to the page or before
[11:01:41] <WG1337> FilipNortic: I would like to check "if result has certain elements" before I do $(".something").html(data);
[11:24:00] <xenaxon> hi all ! need some help!
[11:24:22] <xenaxon> how can I make a draggable element return to it's initial position after dropping into a droppable
[11:24:45] <xenaxon> I want the element to be placed back in its original position
[11:24:50] <xenaxon> so that the user can drag it again
[11:31:10] <tharkun> I heard that JQuery supports Subresource Integrity but I don't seem to be able to get the correct data. Can someone point me in the right direction?
[11:36:10] <taplar> what's the issue?
[11:58:25] <Xatenev_> Hi
[11:58:34] <Xatenev_> What other events than 'resize' fire on resizing the window?
[12:16:58] <elit3x> i am using an account
[12:57:26] * taplar twiddles his thumbs
[12:58:59] * Emperorpenguin cuts taplar's thumbs
[12:59:03] <Emperorpenguin> No faffing
[12:59:10] <taplar> ohnoe!
[13:03:47] * jerit masturbates vigorously
[13:03:59] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:04:00] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:04:29] * Emperorpenguin cuts jerit?
[13:04:33] <Emperorpenguin> Repeatedly
[13:04:47] <snover> please stay on topic
[13:04:53] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:05:07] <robertmaxrees> just a liiiiiittle too far.
[13:22:08] <taplar> wonder if fedex thinks i'm trying to DDoS them
[13:25:28] <robertmaxrees> hitting an endpoint a lot?
[13:26:18] <taplar> heh, not that frequently.  though i'd laugh if they threw up a modal after a few times saying, "look.... its not there yet."
[13:27:21] <taplar> i haven't made the leap yet to get one of those auto refresh plugins
[13:27:50] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.  i'm the same way!  especially with grownup toys.
[13:28:07] <robertmaxrees> i need to replace all of my case fans.
[13:29:02] <taplar> 250mm?
[13:29:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha nah.  case is... 12 years old?
[13:29:24] <robertmaxrees> takes a shit ton of 80mm
[13:29:30] <robertmaxrees> 8 of 'em.
[13:29:55] <taplar> my first case had two 250mms.  the one on the front made it look like some sort of airplane thing.  the side one went out though.
[13:30:48] <robertmaxrees> i remember those!
[13:32:00] <robertmaxrees> oh man that reminds me of the cooler for my first build!

[13:32:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah!!! i knew a dude with one of those!
[13:33:26] <taplar> current case https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119160
[13:35:18] <robertmaxrees> https://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/ProductImage/11-133-107-01.jpg that's mine.
[13:36:03] <taplar> nyce
[13:36:22] <taplar> looks almost star trooperish
[13:36:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm not really a fan (hah) these days but i'm too lazy to get anything else.
[13:36:42] <robertmaxrees> it's also a full tower which makes it easy to work in.
[13:36:54] <taplar> oh yeah, i dunno that i'll go smaller than a full one
[13:37:32] <robertmaxrees> though a removable mb tray would be nice.
[13:38:58] <taplar> they have those?
[13:39:10] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah.
[13:39:22] <robertmaxrees> huge chunk of pack panel comes off with the tray.
[13:39:26] <robertmaxrees> *back
[13:41:14] <jerit> [20:22] <taplar> wonder if fedex thinks i'm trying to DDoS them         <<< your package keeps getting delayed?
[13:42:55] <taplar> i ordered it yesterday so i'm antsy
[13:43:05] <taplar> though there is weather that the site says may delay stuff
[13:43:26] <robertmaxrees> where is it coming from?
[13:43:41] <taplar> NJ, which i found weird
[13:43:49] <robertmaxrees> ebay yeah?
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> errr, newegg?
[13:43:58] <taplar> yeah
[13:44:00] <robertmaxrees> not sure why i said ebay.
[13:44:20] <taplar> we were talking about ebay for monitors i think
[13:44:28] <robertmaxrees> aaaah yeah,.
[15:19:44] <troop> hello, i have multiple form in a page and they have same class forexample class="form" how can i handle the form in button's onclick  which is parent of clicked button?
[15:20:09] <taplar> closest('.form')
[16:34:47] <carpii> i have a floating div in my html5 chat app, and I want to allow users to select text in it. But if they extend outside the div, the browser allows selecting other areas of the DOM too. Is there a way to contain this selection so it only allows selection inside the container the selection began?
[16:40:00] <HyP3r> hello everybody. Short question to the topic of "data" attributes: If I define something like that: <input data-type="test" />. I can select it with $('input[data-type="test"').val(100);. But if I do $('inpput').data('type','test');. I can't select it with the shown way. Why? And how can I fix this?
[16:40:17] <robertmaxrees> so
[16:40:23] <robertmaxrees> .data() does an extra caching step.
[16:40:37] <robertmaxrees> and then edits that cache so it doesn't go back and forth from the DOM.
[16:40:46] <carpii> when you set data at runtime, it goes into a sep array jQuery handles, and not the dom
[16:40:55] <HyP3r> ok
[16:40:57] <robertmaxrees> so using .data() doesn't update it.
[16:40:58] <HyP3r> how can I select them?
[16:41:03] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() instead.
[16:41:17] <robertmaxrees> selecting on attributes is generally not something you should do.
[16:41:22] <carpii> for it to respect css rules youd need to use .attr() and set the data in the DOM, or maybe .prop() not sure
[16:41:40] <carpii> ah nm, you werent asking about css
[16:41:45] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:41:56] <HyP3r> I need a way to select both dom data attirbutes and jquery data attributes
[16:42:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .filter()
[16:42:16] <robertmaxrees> always.
[16:42:29] <robertmaxrees> with .data()
[16:42:53] <HyP3r> Can you show me an example?
[16:43:16] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[16:43:17] <robertmaxrees> has some
[16:43:45] <bjsnider> merge isn't behaving quite as i'd expect
[16:43:47] <HyP3r> Yeah. I'm reading them but its confusing me a bit.
[16:43:57] <bjsnider> the second arraylike object is not merged
[16:44:09] <HyP3r> Isn't this: "$( "li" ).filter( ":even" ).css( "background-color", "red" );" like this: "$('li:even')"
[16:44:20] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:44:24] <robertmaxrees> but .filter() is a little quicker.
[16:44:31] <robertmaxrees> and you can pass it functions.
[16:44:52] <bjsnider> it's merged as a sub-array if i wrap the name in {}
[16:45:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nfaenowm/
[16:46:02] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider can you show us what you're talking about?
[16:46:30] <robertmaxrees> HyP3r take a look at that fiddle i just linked.
[16:46:30] <HyP3r> robertmaxrees: something like that: $('input').filter(function() { return $(this).data('type') == 'test';}).val(100);
[16:46:38] <robertmaxrees> use ===, but sure
[16:46:43] <HyP3r> robertmaxrees: yes I did and guess thats the way
[16:47:14] <HyP3r> robertmaxrees: this will make sure that both layer of cache are checked, the jquery cache and the dom cache
[16:47:31] <robertmaxrees> there's no "dom cache".
[16:47:35] <robertmaxrees> the data cache is the one you care about.
[16:47:42] <HyP3r> ok
[16:47:46] <robertmaxrees> if you're consistently using .data(), you'll be fine.
[16:48:14] <HyP3r> But some data tags are prerenderd from the server html
[16:48:29] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  .data() will read those and cache them on the first use.
[16:49:18] <HyP3r> Okay thanks I'll try that
[16:49:26] <robertmaxrees> like in that fiddle.
[16:49:37] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: both objects look like this: {this="that"}
[16:49:50] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider can you make a fiddle?
[16:50:02] <bjsnider> maybe i'm not building them properly
[16:50:09] <robertmaxrees>  {this="that"} isn't
[16:50:14] <robertmaxrees> *isn't a valid object.
[16:50:15] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[16:50:56] <bjsnider> ok, so i'm not building it correctly
[16:51:07] <robertmaxrees> your code should be throwing an object.
[16:51:07] <HyP3r> First I have to replace all '==' to '===' in my project :)
[16:51:09] <robertmaxrees> err, an error.
[16:51:17] <bjsnider> i'm building it like this: values[this.name] = this.value;
[16:51:18] <robertmaxrees> HyP3r you know that == is kinda bad, yeah?
[16:51:23] <robertmaxrees> bjoe2k4 that's fine then.
[16:51:28] <robertmaxrees> err, bjsnider
[16:51:35] <robertmaxrees> go ahead and make a fiddle.
[16:52:55] <bjsnider> ok, fixed it. i just continued using the same object, instead of creating two and merging them
[16:53:13] <bjsnider> too bad merge doesn't do what it's supposed to
[16:53:20] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:53:22] <robertmaxrees> it does....
[16:54:05] <robertmaxrees> you realize values[this.name] isn't an array, right?
[16:55:11] <bjsnider> the docs say arraylike object
[16:55:23] <robertmaxrees> that's not an array like object, either.
[16:55:32] <robertmaxrees> this.name assumes a string for a na,me
[16:55:37] <robertmaxrees> *implies
[16:58:15] <bjsnider> well, i'll change it if i have to
[16:58:27] <robertmaxrees> you're using a plain object there.
[16:58:28] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[16:58:41] <robertmaxrees> that's why $.merge doesn't work there.
[17:08:19] <bjsnider> it looks good after it's json'ed, so i'll change it only if php can't use it after it goes into $_POST
[17:08:48] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you didn't want an array in the fist place anyuway.
[17:09:21] <carpii> php can read it if it has a POST var name, otherwise you can read raw POST body using file_get_contents("php://input");
[17:09:27] <bjsnider> i think it would have ended up the same way after json, right?
[17:09:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:09:38] <robertmaxrees> arrays and objects are inherently different.
[17:09:49] <robertmaxrees> one uses named properties, the other is just an ordered list.
[17:10:03] <robertmaxrees> well, technically arrays ARE objects, but you know what i mean.
[17:10:32] <carpii> also its kinda difficult to enumerate over objects... well possible but its a bit of a bind
[17:10:44] <robertmaxrees> sorta yeah
[17:11:02] <robertmaxrees> (though you can always just Object.keys(yourObject).forEach() it)
[17:11:31] <bjsnider> the thing i'm worried about is, php arrays look like "this" => "that", and this object is "this" : "that"
[17:11:53] <robertmaxrees> you mean an associative array?
[17:11:58] <carpii> focus on getting the js post how you want it
[17:12:01] <robertmaxrees> because that's more akin to a JS object.
[17:12:05] <carpii> php can deal with anything
[17:12:09] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't have associative arrays.
[17:12:51] <carpii> also if youre sending json to php, you should use json_decode and not be trying to parse it yourself anyway
[17:15:01] <bjsnider> carpii: it's how i want it, assuming php can use it, but i'll find that out in a few minutes
[17:15:18] <robertmaxrees> you can decode that into your associative array or w/e
[17:16:29] <taplar> ah, it's how i want it, the backstreet approach
[17:17:54] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:18:27] <carpii> is there a way to retrieve a platforms CRLF via javascript? Im processing a block of text lines, and want to rebuild them using either \n or \r\n depending on client platform
[17:22:11] <jcrawford> [Illuminate\Database\QueryException] SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'geo_names.location_id' in 'where clause' (SQL: select * from `geo_names` where `geo_names`.`location_id` = 1 and `geo_names`.`location_id` is not null limit 1)
[17:22:15] <jcrawford> whoops sorry
[17:22:19] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:22:20] <robertmaxrees> all good
[17:24:40] <taplar> mmm, that's weird
[17:24:57] <robertmaxrees> que?
[17:25:04] <taplar> x = 1 and x is not null
[17:25:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:25:23] <taplar> you really don't need the latter in that sql
[17:26:03] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[17:26:05] <robertmaxrees> ye
[17:26:52] * taplar continues singing bsb
[17:29:11] <troop> i have multiple button with same classes. ( .btn ) how can i get others instead of clicked btn ?
[17:29:22] <taplar> $('.btn').not(this)
[17:29:23] <robertmaxrees> $('.btn').not(this);
[17:29:24] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:29:27] <taplar> :D
[17:29:31] <troop> :D thx
[17:29:53] <taplar> you would have beat me if not for the semi colon
[17:30:04] <robertmaxrees> prolly
[17:30:35] <troop> robertmaxrees knows jquery, taplar  you need to read a jquery book.
[17:30:44] <troop> you know nothing taplar
[17:30:46] <robertmaxrees> pffffffffffff
[17:30:51] <robertmaxrees> of course he knows js
[17:30:56] <taplar> i'm zen like that
[20:04:34] <bjsnider> is there a .not method?
[20:04:44] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/not/
[20:06:06] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: know any good docs on jquery forma validation?
[20:06:18] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider you mean the plugin?
[20:07:28] <bjsnider> what plugin?
[20:07:33] <robertmaxrees> jquery validate
[20:08:12] <bjsnider> i'll look into it
[20:08:33] <bjsnider> also, can jquery or javascript convert pasted text into utf-8?
[20:08:41] <robertmaxrees> jquery is javascript.
[20:08:50] <robertmaxrees> and could you clarify what you mean?
[20:09:24] <bjsnider> jquery, or failing that, javascript without jquery
[20:09:27] <snover> prefer html5 validation unless you really can’t for some reason.
[20:09:32] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:09:33] <bjsnider> if you're making me type the whole thing out
[20:09:35] <robertmaxrees> good point
[20:09:43] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider jquery is just a dom abstraction lib
[20:10:02] <snover> pasted text will already be utf-8 if you use <meta charset="utf-8"> on your page
[20:10:14] <robertmaxrees> hence why i asked for clarification :)
[20:10:18] <bjsnider> guhhhh
[20:11:41] <snover> though if you retrieve the text via javascript it will always be represented as UCS-2 or UTF-16
[20:12:00] <snover> you won’t be able to tell that, though, for the most part.
[20:14:11] <bjsnider> it works fine when i paste it
[20:14:19] <bjsnider> but others, not always
[20:14:33] <robertmaxrees> paste what?  and define "works fine"
[20:14:34] <robertmaxrees> kinda vague.
[20:15:15] <bjsnider> pasting text out of a site into a textbox and posting it to a db
[20:15:29] <bjsnider> posting it to an action file that goes into a utf8 postgres db
[20:15:52] <bjsnider> and the form page is 100% utf8, because i have php configured that way independent of apache
[20:16:22] <bjsnider> yet somehow, certain users manage to post non-utf8 garbled characters
[20:16:36] <bjsnider> which appear in the db as question marks
[20:18:04] <bjsnider> i can't do anything about it after the post, because by then the characters are already garbled, so i thought maybe javascript culd do soemthing about it before post
[20:27:07] <snover> bjsnider: does your form page have <meta charset="utf-8"> in the head? are you sending a content-type HTTP header with the wrong charset?
[20:27:12] <snover> in the <head>*
[20:29:23] <bjsnider> utf-8
[20:29:37] <bjsnider> it used to be iso-8859-1 though
[20:29:58] <bjsnider> all of this stuff is prehistoric
[21:38:05] <carpii> given a string of "domain.com", is it possibe to write a jQuery selector which matches img[src^="http://*.domain.com"] ?
[22:43:18] <D-rex> cvjh
