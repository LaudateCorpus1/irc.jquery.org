[01:08:49] <ak5> hi everyone, I am trying to write a userscript. I have links in the pagination section of this page, click triggers an event that gets the html and replaces content section with new content. I want it to be appended instead, any way to do this?
[01:31:25] <Uhkis> ?api append @ak5
[01:31:25] <b-ot> ak5: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[03:20:44] <esoldia47> hi, i having problem embeding youtube video using draggable ui, here's an example http://jsfiddle.net/wh0df8wj/  any suggestion guys?
[03:38:04] <Jattenalle> esoldia47, i assume you mean the draggable doesnt trigger when you try to drag the video itself?
[03:38:22] <esoldia47> yes that's what i mean
[03:38:39] <Jattenalle> as far as i know, there's no way to fix that while still allowing the video controls to work
[03:38:59] <Jattenalle> it's because the video is a separate flash frame
[03:39:26] <Jattenalle> ie: any clicks or mouse events in there are passed on to flash, and don't bubble up to the html
[03:39:58] <Jattenalle> you can fix it by using youtube's api and chromeless player to make your own player controls
[03:41:04] <Jattenalle> esoldia47, see https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference for details on the API
[03:42:08] <Jattenalle> or http://tutorialzine.com/2010/07/youtube-api-custom-player-jquery-css/ for the chromeless custom player
[03:43:49] <esoldia47> i use draggable to set position of that iframe on a container, hmm i think i'm gonna put that iframe on temp before it loads
[03:44:36] <esoldia47> after exits, i put the container position  onto the iframe.
[03:44:44] <esoldia47> is that possible?
[03:45:54] <Jattenalle> if you move the container ontop of the iframe the youtube controls won't work
[03:46:07] <Jattenalle> because the clicks will not bubble from your html element up to the iframe
[03:46:16] <Jattenalle> up to -> into*
[03:47:02] <esoldia47> yeah i think so too, i check ont that link a bit thanks Jattenalle
[04:20:32] <Voyage> I have placed google tracking code on my site near <body>  start tag but I cant see any visits on google analytics (cant see in realtime tag also). I just visited my site.  what can be wrong? http://cqtechnologies.com/ source code line 67
[05:14:31] <Lehl0r> hey there
[05:14:47] <Lehl0r> maybe someone can tell me why my checkbox change does not trigger
[05:15:16] <Lehl0r> i have a div where i append some stoff with $("#thediv").append(...)
[05:15:21] <Lehl0r> under this append
[05:15:27] <Lehl0r> i have a checkbox
[05:15:44] <Lehl0r> and after that i call  $("input[type='checkbox']").change(function() {...}
[05:15:50] <Lehl0r> but it does not trigger
[05:16:08] <Lehl0r> does it have something to do with delegation ?
[05:18:25] <sacho> Lehl0r, what do you mean it doesn't trigger?
[05:18:28] <sacho> how are you triggering it?
[05:19:08] <Lehl0r> when i click on the checkbox nothing happens
[05:19:20] <Lehl0r> i have a simple console.log to check it
[05:19:42] <Lehl0r> inside the change function
[05:20:05] <suspicious_eel> Lehl0r: http://jsfiddle.net/gbv74k1q/ ?
[05:28:50] <Lehl0r> well i dunno why but i have it exactly like this
[05:28:57] <Lehl0r> somehow it still does not work
[05:40:12] <Lehl0r> is there a possible css attribute that could prevent it ?
[05:42:24] <Woet> Lehl0r: replicate it on jsfiddle.
[05:42:35] <Woet> or at least paste your entire code
[05:43:27] <Lehl0r> yeah well its part of a large project
[05:43:39] <Woet> so isolate the issue and paste that code.
[05:43:55] <Woet> that's usually what you start with when debugging.
[05:44:13] <Lehl0r> y that's what i did ^^ it drives me nuts
[05:44:29] <Woet> okay, so paste the relevant code only.
[05:44:42] <Lehl0r> i can't isolate the problem in jsfiddle since it works there somehow
[05:45:11] <Woet> so put that code on your website and slowly start enabling more code/resources
[05:54:44] <Lehl0r> ok
[05:54:51] <Lehl0r> at some point
[05:55:02] <Lehl0r> i clear the div with the checkbox
[05:55:07] <Lehl0r> do some sorting
[05:55:13] <Lehl0r> and reappend it
[05:55:28] <Lehl0r> and after that the checkbox doesnt work
[05:55:38] <Woet> and you re-bind after that as well?
[05:55:52] <Woet> the change event.
[05:57:09] <Lehl0r> well seems not :-)
[05:57:15] <Lehl0r> totally forgot that sorting part
[05:57:16] <Lehl0r> ty
[06:41:50] <OnceMe> I have small issue, when I serialize form, one field is not serialized..??? it has name="me" and id="mejquery" and placeholder and maxsize and length inside... why?
[06:42:01] <OnceMe> I access it via $_POST["

[06:42:13] <OnceMe> is that cirrecy way? how can I dump all serialized fields on form?
[06:42:17] <OnceMe> correct way*
[07:00:27] <shelvacu> I'm having the weirdest problem, .on is undefined
[07:00:47] <shelvacu> did jquery deprecate it?
[07:03:07] <mattjs5> no
[07:03:53] <shelvacu> nvm, figured it out
[07:25:57] <Voyage> http://i61.tinypic.com/qno9xx.png
[07:26:20] <Voyage>  any help?
[07:51:46] <Mia> Hllo channel
[07:52:03] <Mia> how can I use the variables I define in jquery document load functio, outside?
[07:52:27] <Mia> I need to define elements on document load, and I need to use them in other functions-- how can I do this?
[07:52:48] <Jattenalle> Mia, global variable
[07:56:01] <Mia> I see Jattenalle - so do I define them without "var" in the beginnnig?
[07:56:17] <Jattenalle> Mia, you define them at the top of your script, outside of the doc ready
[07:56:26] <Jattenalle> then you just access them without re-defining them inside the function
[07:56:32] <Mia> but what will I set them as value?
[07:57:03] <Jattenalle> so: var blah; [newlines] function whatever(){ blah = 5; } // blah is now 5, even outside the function
[07:57:04] <Mia> just empty strings? Jattenalle
[07:57:15] <Mia> oh so I don't have to set it to anything?!
[07:57:21] <Jattenalle> nope
[07:57:23] <Mia> Sorry, as you can see I'm very new to js as well :)
[07:57:27] <Jattenalle> if you dont give it a value it will be "undefined"
[07:57:29] <Mia> okay - I'm trying this now, thanks!
[07:57:37] <Mia> okay that makes sense now!
[07:57:54] <Jattenalle> if you want to be able to do, say: blah ++; you need to declare it with var blah = 0;
[07:58:02] <Jattenalle> so JS knows it should be handled as a number
[07:58:27] <Jattenalle> same with string, if you want to concat strings onto it, blah += 'derp'; you need to declare it with var blah='';
[07:58:44] <Mia> ok thanks, now that makes so much more sense.
[08:00:07] <Mia> Jattenalle, also totally unrelated - cn I reach the event name within the event?
[08:00:17] <Jattenalle> what do you mean?
[08:00:44] <Mia> like on("click",function(something){ //something something });
[08:00:56] <Mia> I need to reach the string, "click" from within the function there
[08:01:25] <Jattenalle> event.type
[08:01:40] <Jattenalle> will be a string with the name of the event
[08:01:46] <Mia> OH!
[08:01:49] <Mia> okay, thanks!
[08:01:58] <Jattenalle> sometimes it's just that simple :)
[08:22:32] <toothe> is Ajax typically in XML ?
[08:22:37] <toothe> or actual HTML ?
[08:30:52] <Paradisee> hello everyone...
[08:31:04] <Paradisee> is there a way to make a string with Capital letters?
[08:31:16] <Paradisee> something like: "my string" -> "My String"
[08:33:42] <Xatenev> Paradisee: Most likely u will have to use the normal .replace function of JS
[08:33:49] <Xatenev> Paradisee: in combination with a regex
[08:34:05] <Xatenev> Paradisee: take a look at the answer in this thread, tis exactly whatu  want: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5122402/uppercase-first-letter-of-variable
[08:34:08] <Paradisee> in python there's a method called title()
[08:34:42] <Paradisee> well, could work....probably there's better
[08:35:43] <Xatenev> Paradisee: You could use a loop aswell
[08:35:49] <Xatenev> loop through every word and use
[08:35:53] <Xatenev> word.charAt(0).toUpperCase()
[08:35:58] <Xatenev> for every word inside ur sentence
[08:36:12] <Paradisee> ya, but it's too stupid :D
[08:36:23] <Xatenev> ^^+
[08:36:30] <Xatenev> why would u need such a function though
[09:12:57] <dsize> I'm attempting to implement @mentions on a site that uses Froala Editor. I have a JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/vq6MH/581. Would anyone be able to tell why it works with a textarea, but not with the Froala editor field (div)? Just un-comment the initialization code at the top of the JS to initialize Froala
[09:13:26] <lilltiger> Is there someway to tell jquery to reparse an element, I add elements dynamicly to the page, some of these elements have classes that binds actions (like click) tothe class. But these wont get applied to dynamiclyadded content. So how to solwe this?
[09:14:59] <sacho> do you mean attributes?
[09:15:35] <sacho> you can try using delegation when you bind the handlers.
[09:17:09] <lilltiger> sacho: like: <div class="onClick"></div> <script>$('.onClick').each( function() { alert('foo'); }); </script> now if i add an new element to the page like another div with that class, it wont react on the click
[09:17:48] <sacho> like I said, use delegation when binding those handlers.
[09:21:30] <lilltiger> hmm, so I need to add it to a parent element, but i might not know wih parents it will have before they are going to be added
[09:24:22] <shoky> lilltiger: it doesn't have to be a direct parent
[09:26:29] <lilltiger> shoky: ok, it just feels like an ackward solution, if I would use .addClass to the div element, would the div then get the events associatied with the class, our would I still have to do the delegate way?
[09:28:41] <shoky> lilltiger:  when you do  $('.whatever')  it only finds the .whatever elements that are currently in the dom.  so $('.whatever').on('click', function..)   would only attach event handlers to the .whatever elements that are in the dom at the time you ran that line
[09:29:14] <shoky> lilltiger: so yes, if you .addClass afterwards it won't have an event handler attached
[09:30:48] <shoky> so you have 2 choices: attach handlers only after the elements are already in the DOM,  or use event delegation and then you don't need to care when the elements are in the DOM, cause the event handler is actually attached to an ancestor
[09:32:15] <lilltiger> ok, I was hoping for a nifty way to tell jquery to reparse just the newly added html. guess ill have to use delegation :/
[09:35:25] <shoky> delegation IS the nifty way to deal with this ;p
[09:36:30] <shoky> all it takes is e.g. replacing $('.whatever').on('click', function..)  with:  $(document).on('click', '.whatever', function..)
[09:38:34] <lilltiger> well, i wouldent call it nifty as it would check that function evrytime the document was clicked.. performance!! :p
[09:39:02] <toothe> I noticed that hwen I do an ajax request, I get a 403 error, suggesting that the cookies aren't sent.
[09:39:03] <lilltiger> but then, I probly does something like that either way
[09:39:08] <shoky> you don't have to use document for it
[09:39:13] <shoky> was just an example
[09:39:15] <toothe> Is there something I need to do to send the cookies along with a POST request?
[09:39:19] <lilltiger> I know
[09:39:54] <shoky> and.. complain when you actually have a performance problem
[09:40:54] <shoky> with delegation you're also using less memory, as it's only one event handler instead of multiple
[09:43:00] <lilltiger> shoky: It's just my C++ brain that interfers, the performance is probly the same as the browser probly parses the dom either way
[09:46:14] <lilltiger> toothe: no idea why you would want to send the cookie, maybe you want session cookies, would suggest you to read about them too see if that is what you want.
[09:46:50] <toothe> Yes, I meant the session cookie.
[09:47:41] <lilltiger> Then as long as you stay on the same server you shoul just have to enable that session on the target php page
[09:48:00] <toothe> I'm using Django/Python
[09:48:33] <toothe> I was under the impression that the browser sends the session cookie as part of the rquest.
[09:48:36] <toothe> request*
[09:49:14] <shoky> toothe it does. is your post to a different origin maybe?
[09:58:49] <gx> Hey guys, we have a web ticker on our site that's using CSS transitions (and consequently eating up a ton of CPU and causing ff crashes over time). We've debugged pretty extensively but are having no luck. Looking for someone who could take a look at it and potentially fix. Compensation in return, please pm me. thanks!
[10:05:24] <toothe> shoky: no, its not.
[10:05:28] <toothe> shoky: sorry, I steped away for a moment.
[10:25:51] <shoky> toothe: donno.. i'd look for another reason for the 403. or make sure the cookie really isn't being sent
[10:32:12] <toothe> hm...
[10:32:18] <toothe> shoky: I'll do a wireshark on it.
[10:35:03] <Hejkki> hi. if i have h1's and h2's, if i have $.each($('h2'), function...  i'd like to refer to the previous h1, and it's contents, how can i do it?
[10:35:48] <Hejkki> $(this).prev('h2')... isn't working
[10:36:19] <Hejkki> it works if the previous element is h2, but if there are several h2's and i click the third for example, it isn't working
[10:36:30] <Hejkki> i mean if the previous element is h1
[10:36:33] <shoky> Hejkki: are the h1's and h2's siblings?
[10:37:09] <shoky> if so you could try .prevAll('h1').first()
[10:37:23] <Hejkki> siblings, <h1>example<h1><h2>example</h2><h2>another example</h2>
[10:37:35] <shoky> ok then what i said should work
[10:37:43] <Hejkki> ok trying.. :)
[10:43:33] <knapper_tech> are there methods that a node can use to detach itself and add itself to a node?
[10:43:52] <knapper_tech> i'm looking for child.remove_self().add_to(some_other_node) API's
[10:46:24] <toothe> that's weird
[10:46:39] <toothe> I checked the cookie with wireshark, its sent over...but I still get a 403 error.
[10:46:45] <toothe> maybe something is wrong with my code.
[10:48:34] <toothe> weird...
[10:48:39] <toothe> why am I getting 403 errors...
[10:48:43] <toothe> I even turned off the 403 checking.
[10:51:05] <toothe> maybe somehting is wrong with my Ajax request.
[10:53:28] <toothe> gah...why am I getting 403 errors when I request a page via ajax.

[10:57:38] * CssNoob good morning and goodnight y'all
[11:16:53] <Hejkki> ok got it working, thanks a lot
[11:45:20] <krambiorix> how can i stop the beforeunload event?
[11:52:42] <shoky> krambiorix: you can only show a prompt to the user letting him choose if he wants to keep the page open
[11:54:32] <krambiorix> shoky, not a dialog?
[11:54:53] <shoky> krambiorix: the dialog that the browser shows, similar to an alert
[11:55:03] <krambiorix> shoky, so not a jquery dialog
[11:55:06] <shoky> no
[11:55:30] <krambiorix> shoky, ok thanks
[11:55:45] <shoky> sure
[12:04:20] <krambiorix> shoky, how can i use a custom message for the browser's dialog?
[12:04:21] <krambiorix> http://jsfiddle.net/xgnn5w0r/
[12:07:51] <doug64k> krambiorix: that is how - but it has been abused to death by spammers and aggressive sites so they ruined it for everyone
[12:08:12] <krambiorix> doug64k, so a custom message is not possible?
[12:08:26] <doug64k> not always possible
[12:08:52] <doug64k> you should try to, like you do, but it won't necessarily show the user, since that text is often used to trick the user
[12:10:17] <krambiorix> hmm, this is for a webapplication , not for a website... What a pitty
[12:10:36] <doug64k> krambiorix: jstraight.com <-- go there and put anything in the top left editor and close the tab. it will prompt "you have unsaved changes"
[12:10:53] <doug64k> does that work for you?
[12:11:46] <krambiorix> well, in FF it doesn't show the custom message
[12:12:58] <doug64k> krambiorix: if it works in chrome your implementation is ok, it's ok if FF won't show it. it won't because it apparently never shows it
[12:13:21] <doug64k> my page beforeunload message won't work in FF either
[12:16:06] <shoky> krambiorix: i use:   window.beforeunload=function(e){ e = e || window.event; var prompt = 'Dont go!'; if (e) e.returnValue = prompt; return prompt; }
[12:16:36] <shoky> iirc it works in chrome,ff,ie,safari
[12:17:27] <shoky> whoops should be  window.onbeforeunload=
[12:18:10] <doug64k> shoky: don't use the ancient on event properties, use addEventListener or use jquery .on
[12:18:26] <krambiorix> shoky, i'm trying to disable navigating away when a condition is met
[12:18:50] <shoky> krambiorix: the only condition that can disable it is if the user clicks the "stay on page" button
[12:19:06] <doug64k> $(window).on('beforeunload', function() ...
[12:19:38] <shoky> yeah doug64k donno why i used the old way
[12:19:52] <doug64k> shoky: I knew you knew :)
[12:20:10] <krambiorix> hmm
[12:21:28] <krambiorix> i will disable all my anchors when the condition is met
[12:21:46] <shoky> ;]
[12:23:59] <krambiorix> would it be possible to unbind all anchors and then put them back?
[12:26:54] <doug64k> krambiorix: yes it would be possible. you could .detach the real ones, then .clone off that and put the clone in its place. the clone would have to stop propagation so delegated listeners wont get the click. then when you want the real element back, replace it with the one you detached
[12:28:17] <krambiorix> doug64k, clone and hide the original?
[12:28:30] <doug64k> krambiorix: the detach will take the original out of the document
[12:29:13] <krambiorix> ow
[12:29:54] <krambiorix> doug64k, but how can i put the detached back?
[12:30:03] <doug64k> .replaceWith
[12:30:16] <krambiorix> .replaceWith(what?)
[12:30:23] <doug64k> what you detached
[12:31:10] <doug64k> there is an implied for each one loop wrapped around what I am saying
[12:31:29] <krambiorix> doug64k, my problem is that i have a lot of elements with a click event bound on it...
[12:32:26] <doug64k> here is why my suggestion will work: 1) if they put event listeners right on the anchors, the one you clone off and put in its place wont have any of those. 2) if they are using delegation, your imposter anchors will be stopping propagation, so their delegated listener wont get the click
[12:33:05] <krambiorix> doug64k, yes, is there a way to find all elements which have click event bound to it? :)
[12:33:22] <doug64k> in a debugger you can. in production I dont think so
[12:33:56] <doug64k> you dont want other people to mess with your handlers, therefore you cant mess with anyone elses handlers
[12:34:48] <doug64k> I don't like the sound of what you are talking about though...
[12:34:55] <doug64k> sounds like a spammer/malicious thing
[12:35:09] <krambiorix> doug64k, can i, on click, disable it and when the condition is met, enable it again. Like  $('a, .....').unbind('click') ..... do stuff..... and then $('a,.....').bind(originalhandler)
[12:36:19] <doug64k> krambiorix: yes, you could set a data property on the clone element that stores the original element. to undo you just grab the original out of the clone and replace it into place
[12:37:03] <krambiorix> doug64k, can you give me some (pseudo) code how to do it?
[12:39:10] <krambiorix> brb
[12:42:00] <km2> not sure where to start with this but i want use jquery to continuously display output from a long-running backend process (think ping, e.g. a new line every second or so). the idea is to have a button to start this process and then have its progress shown to the user line-by-line as things happen. ideas?
[12:43:13] <Xatenev> no sense what u expect as an answer km2
[12:43:21] <Xatenev> Thats okay for me that u wanna do that^^
[12:47:08] <doug64k> krambiorix: http://www.jstraight.com/1155/1
[12:51:45] <toothe> undefined is not a function with this: var csrftoken = $.cookie('csrftoken');
[12:52:49] <doug64k> toothe: you need to load the jquery cookie plugin
[12:52:55] <toothe> Google says I need to load jquery.cookie.js
[12:53:09] <toothe> oh...how do I do that?
[12:53:29] <doug64k> <script src="//url/of/that"></script>  in your html
[12:53:39] <doug64k> after jquery
[12:53:46] <toothe> oh, its a separate scipt....
[12:53:53] <doug64k> one sec...
[12:54:20] <toothe> https://plugins.jquery.com/cookie/
[12:54:35] <doug64k> toothe: <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-cookie/1.4.1/jquery.cookie.min.js"></script>
[12:54:43] <toothe> I find it kind of odd that it isn't part of jquery by default.
[12:54:48] <toothe> seems like a standard thing to do.
[12:55:19] <doug64k> toothe: it's not standard. you rarely mess with cookies on the client side. the server sets/expects them and clients are usually oblivious
[12:55:43] <doug64k> if you want to know who is logged in, there is a better way than a cookie
[12:55:45] <toothe> Are you sure? Any kind of ajax on an authenticated site would use that
[12:56:00] <doug64k> you should ask the server who am i  - the auth is 100% the server's problem
[12:56:11] <toothe> any kind of csrftoken mechanism with ajax
[12:56:51] <doug64k> toothe: the server would set it and the server would use it in future requests. the code on the client generally doesn't worry about that
[12:57:07] <toothe> that's what I thought too
[12:57:21] <toothe> apparently with Django, you have to specifically do this part.
[12:57:27] <toothe> which, tbh, I don't fully understand.
[12:57:40] <toothe> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/contrib/csrf/#ajax
[12:57:52] <doug64k> that is just special handling of cross-site requests
[12:58:10] <toothe> how is this different?
[12:58:37] <toothe> I guess I don't quite understand what its doing different? After all, the GET/POST request has the session cookie -I checked with Wireshark.
[13:02:04] <doug64k> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery it prevents a third party from issuing a request to the victim domain and having it use the session cookie without your permission
[13:02:27] <doug64k> it makes the session cookie less automatic, you need the csrf token too
[13:02:52] <toothe> okay - but isn't the cookie already sent in the POST/GET request?
[13:03:00] <toothe> as part of the Cookie?
[13:03:13] <doug64k> say you were logged on to gmail. I could put a url that does a request to their API and it would use the session cookie you had. they have to block that
[13:03:40] <toothe> how would it use the cookie that they sent me?
[13:03:46] <toothe> and, how would your block work/ I think I don't get this...
[13:03:53] <toothe> I read that wiki early on....
[13:04:39] <krambiorix> doug64 thanks a lot! sry for late replace
[13:04:42] <krambiorix> *reply
[13:04:49] <doug64k> toothe: 1) you go log on to gmail. 2) gmail sets some session cookie "sesh". 3) victim goes to badperson.com, 4) badperson.com has an img with "www.gmail.com/?deleteallmail=1234"
[13:04:54] <bongjovi> Anyone here used jquery transition?
[13:05:01] <bongjovi> Seems to be broken on the latest version of firefox
[13:05:30] <doug64k> toothe: gmail is so dumb it believes it and there is a lame deleteallmail thing :)
[13:05:46] <doug64k> toothe: in real life, gmail wouldn't believe it, because there is no csrf token
[13:06:11] <bongjovi> jquery transit*
[13:06:18] <doug64k> toothe: note that when it requests that img, it would have sent your gmail session cookie
[13:06:59] <toothe> it would send your cookie to gmail.com/?deleteallemail, but the attacker would not get it.
[13:07:11] <doug64k> toothe: so. he could do damage
[13:07:12] <toothe> gmail would be sent it again - which would be useless to it.
[13:07:18] <toothe> ohhhhhhhhh, he could make actions happen?
[13:07:26] <doug64k> toothe: if gmail didnt do csrf he could make mail delete
[13:07:38] <toothe> i see...so, how does the CSRF save it?
[13:08:03] <doug64k> the malicious site has no idea what csrf token value to use
[13:08:20] <toothe> sure. So, how does the client send it over in each valid request?
[13:08:28] <toothe> a legitimate client.
[13:09:00] <toothe> if its not part of his session cookie alone (or at all?)
[13:10:44] <doug64k> toothe: you need to setup a beforeSend callback that does xhr.setRequestHeader("X-CSRFToken", token)
[13:12:13] <doug64k> $.ajax({url: '...', beforeSend: function(xhr) { xhr.setRequestHeader('X-CSRFToken', token); }, data: ... )
[13:12:26] <toothe> yes, that's what the pagealso says
[13:12:28] <toothe> almost exactly, in fact
[13:12:34] <toothe> but, I guess I"m more interested in what's goin gon behind the scenes
[13:12:46] <doug64k> toothe: there isn't a lot of room to be different :D
[13:13:07] <toothe> i might re-read the wiki...but I guess I don't get it entirely
[13:13:25] <doug64k> toothe: they provide you with a secret that must be provided when you do a request
[13:13:33] <toothe> that partis simple enough.
[13:13:43] <toothe> but, how does a legitimate client send it in each subsequent requesT?
[13:13:51] <doug64k> beforeSend
[13:14:00] <toothe> I didn't write that in any other code I've written
[13:14:04] <doug64k> an HTTP request header
[13:14:16] <toothe> okay, so the HTTP request header - as a session cookie, no?
[13:14:20] <toothe> err, not session cookie
[13:14:21] <toothe> as a cookie
[13:14:31] <doug64k> the cookie is a header. irrelevant
[13:14:47] <toothe> ...as an actual Request value?
[13:15:09] <toothe> like POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nX-Request-token-whatever: abc123 " ?
[13:15:24] <doug64k> yes X-CSRFToken
[13:15:29] <toothe> ahh....
[13:16:15] <doug64k> that's why you do it in beforeSend. right at the last moment jquery lets you mess with the XHR. there you can insert a custom header
[13:16:37] <toothe> so, lets ignore jquery and ajax for a moment
[13:16:52] <toothe> in a normal browser request, does the client send that X-CSRFToken value in each request?
[13:16:56] <toothe> in each GET/POST request?
[13:17:02] <doug64k> no
[13:17:09] <tables> http://paste2.org/DhfkIOna   <-- how do i get whatever is outputted from that and store it in a var that i can use?
[13:17:11] <doug64k> you mean people or you?
[13:17:15] <tables> from the ajax command
[13:17:24] <toothe> doug64k: pardon?
[13:17:44] <doug64k> if the site has CSRF protections, then yes they would have to do that in each request that enforces that protection
[13:18:03] <toothe> yes, I get that part.
[13:18:19] <toothe> but, what I'masking is, the server must assign the CSRFToken at som epoint to the client, correct?
[13:18:25] <doug64k> normal requests dont have X-CSRFToken
[13:18:37] <doug64k> X- is a prefix that is reserved for non-standard extensions
[13:19:41] <doug64k> toothe: yes it does. and they provide a way for you to inject the value of it into your page so your code can get it
[13:19:48] <toothe> okay.
[13:20:21] <toothe> But, lets suppose there is a legitimate link to page1.php. At the same time floating around on evil sites, there is a link to page2.php
[13:20:35] <toothe> How does the client know to send the CSRF token to page1.php, but not to send it to page2.php ?
[13:20:44] <doug64k> toothe: perhaps something like <body data-csrf="%{ csrf_thingy }%">  or whatever
[13:21:05] <doug64k> then $('body').data('csrf') would fetch it
[13:21:18] <toothe> I'm not talking JS right now...
[13:21:21] <toothe> I'm talking just the general mechanism
[13:21:24] <doug64k> it breaks caching when you do that though
[13:21:26] <toothe> unless JS is required for htis to work...?
[13:21:51] <doug64k> toothe: pages wouldn't have csrf protection
[13:22:24] <doug64k> toothe: ajax requests that send or get data need it
[13:22:44] <toothe> I guess I still don't get that last part...
[13:23:02] <doug64k> csrf = prove that you aren't doing a malicious post token
[13:23:16] <toothe> right.
[13:23:17] <toothe> But how?
[13:23:23] <toothe> because why does page1.php get the token, but not page2?
[13:23:46] <toothe> why would the client selectively send the csrftoken to page1.php, but not page2.php ?
[13:24:00] <doug64k> toothe: I explained it already: it provides you with a secret (token), and you have to show that token when you do an ajax request
[13:24:29] <toothe> okay, so the server gives you a token
[13:24:40] <toothe> and for some reason, you don't send that token to a malicious site, but you do send it to a legitimate site...
[13:24:45] <toothe> the mechanism of why I don't get
[13:25:01] <toothe> I apologize for frustrating you
[13:25:23] <doug64k> if site A has an img on site B, and site B has a session cookie, then it will send the session cookie when it requests from B
[13:26:13] <doug64k> csrf works because if that img were protected, it would require me to send a secret value that would have been provided when it generated the page with the img link
[13:26:37] <doug64k> and if site A is malicious, it won't know what value to use
[13:27:00] <doug64k> it prevents another site from using an open session
[13:28:14] <doug64k> if you are logged in to gmail, and you go to something.com, and something.com has an img that has a GET request style url and the url is on gmail, it will send the gmail cookie and use your gmail session!
[13:28:38] <doug64k> so their server needs to check for a csrf token
[13:28:45] <doug64k> and something.com won't know what the token is
[13:29:10] <doug64k> their server = gmail server
[13:30:11] <doug64k> toothe: are you trying to figure out where the hacker reads all the intercepted data and takes over the world... it doesn't happen. he just tricks a users browser into using an active session on a different domain
[13:30:20] <toothe> no, i get that
[13:30:40] <toothe> I'm reading and re-reading what you wrote, but I still don't get *WHY* the browser behaves differently.
[13:31:27] <toothe> why the client's browser chooses to send the CSRFToken to some pages, but not to others.
[13:32:59] <doug64k> browsers don't choose anything. their code adds the header
[13:33:05] <doug64k> the sites code
[13:33:26] <toothe> okay, so why does the legitiamte browser know to send the CSRF token to page1.html?
[13:33:34] <toothe> because the server gave it to it, right?
[13:33:37] <doug64k> you dont send tokens to pages
[13:34:02] <toothe> it gets sent to the webserver
[13:34:28] <doug64k> when you request a page, it may contain a token. the server makes the page know the token. the page's scripts retrieve the token and use it when they do ajax requests
[13:35:00] <toothe> okay
[13:35:12] <toothe> so when you request page2.php, it may also contain a token
[13:35:19] <toothe> and that token is also sent
[13:35:20] <doug64k> later, when those ajax requests are processed, the server verifies that you provided the same token value as what it told you
[13:35:35] <toothe> so, why isn't that token also sent to page2.php?
[13:35:50] <toothe> why would a request to page1.php not get that token sent?
[13:35:52] <doug64k> it doesn't have the placeholder that injects it into the page
[13:36:02] <toothe> huh?
[13:37:18] <toothe> so far, I still don't see why the browser *sometimes* sends the token, but then doesn't other times
[13:37:21] <toothe> as if it has ot know beforehand
[13:37:27] <toothe> you're saying the token is validated, fine.
[13:37:34] <toothe> but its selectively not validated other times?
[13:37:41] <toothe> i mean, not sent other times.
[13:38:03] <toothe> so, when the clientr equests page1.php, the browser just *knows* to send the token
[13:38:10] <doug64k> a token is a secret like a little password
[13:38:12] <toothe> but when the client requests page2.php, the browser just *knows* not to send the token
[13:38:18] <toothe> right< I get that part...
[13:38:20] <toothe> arbitrary hash
[13:39:42] <toothe> so, the client arbitrarily knows to send the password/token to 1 page, but arbitrarily decides not to send it to another page
[13:39:49] <toothe> (sorry, I said page again, I meant when reqesting the page)
[13:40:06] <doug64k> I can put a for on my page that posts to another site. if you had a cookie for the other site it would send the cookie!
[13:40:14] <doug64k> form*
[13:40:57] <doug64k> I can post gmail.com api servers from any site
[13:41:11] <doug64k> and if that person was logged in it would send the gmail session cookie
[13:41:32] <toothe> sigh...
[13:41:34] <doug64k> you have to understand that far to have a chance understanding the rest
[13:41:36] <toothe> I sitll don't see the difference...
[13:41:46] <toothe> yeah, I get that you put a form that has the token, sure
[13:42:07] <toothe> so, lets say base.php has <form type=hidden name=token value=abc123>
[13:43:27] <toothe> when you click on a link to page1.php, even though its not a POST/GET method, page1.php is sent the form value (somehow)
[13:45:48] <doug64k> toothe: please stop fixating on the page1 page2 thing... it doesn't help you understand it
[13:45:56] <toothe> fair...
[13:46:02] <toothe> i'll re-read the wiki again like I said I would...
[13:46:07] <toothe> I also feel dumb lol
[13:46:07] <doug64k> toothe: if you are logged in to gmail, then any request to gmail will send the cookie that gmail set
[13:46:10] <doug64k> agreed?
[13:46:18] <toothe> understood.
[13:46:55] <doug64k> ok, so if a malicious page had a form with action="http://...gmail.../..." then THAT form post would send the session cookie
[13:47:30] <toothe> so far so good...
[13:47:51] <doug64k> now malicious.com can perform requests using your logged on session
[13:47:56] <toothe> oh wait...its starting to click
[13:48:30] <doug64k> because the browser is being so helpful and sending the gmail cookie when it does a post to gmail
[13:48:56] <doug64k> even if that form is on evil.com
[13:49:08] <toothe> so, CSRF is a POST variable...
[13:49:37] <toothe> a hidden post variable that is like a password, right?
[13:49:45] <toothe> am I right so far?
[13:50:12] <doug64k> before we lose too much context...
[13:50:26] <doug64k> gmail requires you to provide the csrf token when you post
[13:50:38] <toothe> okay....
[13:50:51] <doug64k> but the evil site doesnt know it. if you were on the real gmail site, the server would have "told" the page what the csrf token is
[13:51:06] <doug64k> and the page would provide it when it goes to delete something or whatever
[13:51:54] <toothe> okay...would it be safe to say that thus far you've been describing the protection mechanism as a hidden post variable?
[13:51:59] <toothe> (or GET, I suppse)
[13:52:01] <toothe> suppose*
[13:52:30] <doug64k> you could do that but they use an http header instead
[13:52:41] <toothe> why?
[13:53:11] <doug64k> doesnt force you to add properties to json or whatever
[13:54:17] <doug64k> it's not part of the request. it's data about the data request
[13:54:34] <toothe> and the client has to send it back to validate?
[13:54:37] <toothe> ohhhhhhhhhhhh
[13:54:38] <phiz> w4
[13:54:41] <toothe> about the data requested....
[13:54:49] <toothe> wait no...nvmd
[13:55:27] <toothe> so, the server sends it as part of the requested data.
[13:56:11] <doug64k> no, the client sends it as a request header and the server verifies it
[13:56:23] <toothe> why does the client send it as a request header?
[13:56:24] <doug64k> but before that the server told the cient the token somehow
[13:56:48] <doug64k> toothe: to prove that it isn't a malicious cross site request forgery
[13:56:55] <toothe> i mean, programmatically why?
[13:56:59] <toothe> i understand the logic of that
[13:57:07] <toothe> but if I give you a token, how do you know when to send it back to me?
[13:57:30] <doug64k> you know because you are doing a request like a form post or ajax
[13:58:00] <doug64k> you know when every ajax request fails
[13:58:30] <toothe> so, lets say I give you a token
[13:58:35] <toothe> you have myToken
[13:58:46] <toothe> how do you know to send it to a legitimate page vs an illegitmate page?
[13:59:22] <toothe> if its not just a POST variable, hat is.
[14:00:38] <toothe> doug64k: Do these tokens change per page?
[14:00:41] <doug64k> toothe: the server generated and stored a unique value associated with the user's session. when it sends a page, the templating engine is provided with the value of the token so the persons html can have it in there somewhere. the page has the token. the code on the page gets the token and adds headers when needed using its value
[14:01:21] <toothe> hm...okay...
[14:01:25] <toothe> that makes sense.
[14:01:39] <toothe> but, so far in my DJango writing, I've used the CSRF mechanism, butI haven't written a line of JS around it
[14:01:41] <doug64k> the server's ajax request handlers would verify that the value of the X-CSRF token matches what it stored in the users session, otherwise reject cross site request forgery attempt
[14:01:43] <toothe> (forgetting Ajax)
[14:01:59] <toothe> unless there's some Ajax taking place behind the scenes that I'm not aware of....
[14:03:04] <doug64k> you can't "forget ajax" when talking about csrf because it doesn't work unless you programmatically add request headers on the client
[14:03:13] <toothe> right.
[14:03:19] <toothe> So, perhaps the framework I'm using is doing this for me...?
[14:03:22] <toothe> and I just don't see it?
[14:04:30] <toothe> I see this line: <input type='hidden' name='csrfmiddlewaretoken' value='SAzxk0UcNqu1PmPRXyZRbDyR4kBqh0u0' />
[14:04:42] <toothe> but, I see no javascript anywhere that would put that in my headers.
[14:04:57] <doug64k> csrf prevents a malicious site from tricking the browser into using a session that is active because of a cookie set on the other domain
[14:05:01] <toothe> so, how does it get into my browser's headers?
[14:05:07] <bongjovi> Does anyone know why $(elem).data('transform') would be breaking a script?
[14:05:11] <bongjovi> in Firefox only
[14:05:28] <bongjovi> I can console.log it in chrome, but not ff
[14:06:14] <doug64k> toothe: it doesnt get into your browsers headers. it is added to the headers of requests
[14:06:23] <toothe> why?
[14:06:32] <toothe> why would my browser add it to the header of the request?
[14:07:31] <doug64k> the code it is executing calls https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#setRequestHeader()
[14:07:49] <toothe> doug64k: Again, I didn't write a lick of JS prior to 3 days ago
[14:08:00] <toothe> yet I am using Django's CSRF mechanism
[14:08:39] <doug64k> ain't work don't broken
[14:09:09] <toothe> you're saying JS is *required* for CSRF protection work
[14:09:18] <toothe> I'm saying there wasn't a single line of JS in my code up til 3 days ago.
[14:09:28] <doug64k> there's nothing to protect if there are no ajax request handlers on the server side for the site
[14:09:52] <toothe> what...?
[14:09:57] <toothe> protect form posts
[14:10:00] <toothe> that's the whole point
[14:10:07] <doug64k> forms or any other ajax request
[14:10:10] <toothe> look, if CSRF Token's protect forms, fine.
[14:10:22] <toothe> I get it - the token must be a valid POST/GET variable.
[14:10:26] <toothe> I get that part - that's simple
[14:10:43] <toothe> but, you also then said the request headers send the token
[14:10:45] <toothe> and that's where you lost me
[14:10:56] <toothe> because the *ONLY* way the Token can get into the request headers is if some JS put its there
[14:10:58] <doug64k> a form and an ajax request are essentially the same thing. when doing it with ajax it is done programmatically. when it is a form it might use the old submit button mechanism and replaces the page with the response, but ends up being roughly the same thing
[14:11:00] <toothe> and I didn't write a single line of JS
[14:11:19] <toothe> doug64k: still.
[14:11:23] <toothe> doug64k: can I call you?
[14:11:38] <doug64k> not a good time
[14:11:44] <toothe> darn...
[14:11:55] <toothe> because you're saying things that are contradictory to me.
[14:12:01] <doug64k> what part
[14:12:39] <toothe> so with a FORM, is CSRF protection through a GET/POST variable that is dybnamic each time -please confirm that?
[14:13:02] <doug64k> sure it could be a hidden input with the right value and name
[14:13:07] <toothe> okay
[14:13:21] <toothe> so then what does X-CSRF-Token, the header, have to do with anything?
[14:13:32] <doug64k> it's just another way to provide it
[14:13:54] <toothe> so I return back to my original question
[14:13:57] <doug64k> what if it were a binary file upload? would you want to impose that it have a way to encode some little text string?
[14:14:16] <toothe> huh?
[14:14:41] <toothe> we've been talking about his for a little less than 2 hours now
[14:14:45] <toothe> and I still don't get it
[14:14:45] <doug64k> setting the http header is ONE WAY to provide the token. there are other ways that are possible. does it work on your site? I don't know. this is all hypothetical
[14:14:45] <toothe> fuck
[14:14:59] <toothe> okay so look
[14:15:05] <toothe> in my Ajax request, I SAW the token sent
[14:15:07] <toothe> I used wireshark.
[14:15:11] <toothe> and yet it still came back as a 403
[14:15:58] <doug64k> the answer is the documentation
[14:16:04] <doug64k> did you get a hello world form to post?
[14:16:44] <doug64k> er, not form, ajax request
[14:16:57] <doug64k> django?
[14:17:00] <toothe> here, let me show you.
[14:17:48] <doug64k> toothe: you can put the token on your page with  {% csrf_token %}
[14:18:31] <doug64k> like I said a while back, you might do <body data-csrf=" {% csrf_token %}">
[14:18:37] <doug64k> oops no space there
[14:19:10] <doug64k> then you do the other xhr beforeSend stuff from way back and add the csrf token from $('body').data('csrf')
[14:20:34] <toothe> i did that.
[14:20:48] <toothe> err....just a sec
[14:21:16] <toothe> This is my failed request: <input type='hidden' name='csrfmiddlewaretoken' value='SAzxk0UcNqu1PmPRXyZRbDyR4kBqh0u0' />
[14:21:19] <toothe> woops...
[14:21:37] <doug64k> useless by now probably
[14:22:13] <toothe> http://puu.sh/cK7YV/4a4ebb2fa3.png
[14:22:23] <toothe> no, I don't mind if You nkow the token anyways, its a development server
[14:22:34] <toothe> there's all but nothing on it :-)
[14:22:41] <toothe> bt, i'm less woried abou tthat..
[14:22:42] <toothe> bbl
[14:24:20] <doug64k> if you are sure you got the csrf right and it send the headers correctly, then look for another cause of 403. did you check the server logs for a possibly good error message?
[14:37:12] <toothe> for jQUery Cookie, can I just install the single file jquery.cookie.js ?
[14:37:28] <doug64k> toothe: you have to load jquery before the cookie plugin
[14:38:46] <doug64k> toothe: ideally? ideally you would have a grunt build that browserify minified it all into a compressed single-request block
[14:39:28] <doug64k> toothe: easy mode is to simply have two script tags, one for jquery, one for the plugin
[15:26:19] <doug64k> does anyone seriously use yeoman?
[15:26:36] <doug64k> it's always an exercise in figuring out what is wrong with the grunt file
[15:27:00] <doug64k> yeoman is great for learning stuff but can it be used for real production work?
[15:32:06] <sammych1> I'm trying to narrow down some issues on WebViews on Android 4.0 - 4.3 (pre 4.4). I don't have a readily accessible web inspector (and pre-4.4, there isn't a tethered option). So I've been making do with the default 'Internet' browser on Android on 4.0.4, which seems a pretty close analog to the WebApp webview in capability.
[15:32:06] <sammych1> I'm using jQM, and I'm seeing that touches at bubbling through popup screens and activating form elements, such as the selectmenu.
[15:32:06] <sammych1> Tested on Android 4.0.2 on default 'Internet' browser: http://jsbin.com/kavayuqaba/1/ Tap on 'Delete page...' and tap slowly enough to not activate the zoom. Eventually, the select menu opens.
[15:32:52] <sammych1> Actually, two taps is enough.
[15:33:33] <krambiorix> from an ajax call i get pdf data, how can i open it?
[15:37:12] <Prometheian> I'm looking for a javascript library that I can tack onto some html elements to validate field min length, email, phone numbers and the such. I'd prefer if it did it when the form loses focus with option to happen on button click. Anyone have suggestions?
[15:39:34] <Prometheian> http://omarshammas.github.io/formancejs looks sexy
[15:40:06] <Technodrome> question
[15:41:07] <Technodrome> when you click an item say in a grid, and you want it to spend, you know these things are somewhat common, like you click an item it expands you get more info on it , 3 column grid , then when you click an item might take up the whole grid
[15:41:30] <Technodrome> what is the exact name of this technique, and is there any jquery libraries to look into for help on this?
[15:42:17] <sammych1> *expand?
[15:42:34] <intothev01d> you mean collapse or accordion? http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[15:43:12] <sammych1> like an accordion, but in a grid
[16:06:46] <Prometheian> How can I stop my button's click from firing completely when there are elements in my form that are required but not filled out?
[16:15:18] <DreadKnight> I'm trying to make show some avatars based on an array, when I click an avatar I want to display that one in the center, can you tell my why my carousel function is getting triggered endlessly? http://jsfiddle.net/DreadKnight/eod4ngqL/1/
[16:26:12] <intothev01d> Prometheian, you can use preventDefault() if it doesn't pass validation
[16:26:54] <Prometheian> I've gotten a few steps further, I'm stopping the "saving" but it's closing the modal.
[16:27:45] <intothev01d> you would have to put an example up
[16:27:58] <Prometheian> ooh, ugly, gimme a sec
[16:29:42] <intothev01d> DreadKnight, you call carousel, which calls update, which calls carousel again
[16:30:28] <Prometheian> https://github.com/krishnaglick/LittletonProject2/blob/EmploymentInfo/LittletonProject2/Views/Apply/Apply.cshtml
[16:30:35] <Prometheian> Line 330 there
[16:30:39] <Prometheian> for the button
[16:30:43] <Prometheian> https://github.com/krishnaglick/LittletonProject2/blob/EmploymentInfo/LittletonProject2/ViewModels/ApplyViewModel.js
[16:30:50] <Prometheian> line 45 there for the javascript stuff
[16:40:13] <ConspiratorX> Promethian: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19073238/how-to-prevent-bootstrap-modal-from-closing-from-button-using-onclick
[16:40:37] <intothev01d> ah. you'd need to override the modal hide method as well
[16:40:50] <intothev01d> whats up Brian :)
[16:41:08] <ConspiratorX> lol, not much
[16:41:29] <intothev01d> Prometheian, see above ^
[16:42:36] <intothev01d> so if you use data-dismiss, you have to override hide, otherwise remove that and call the hide yourself on it later after validation
[16:42:53] <Prometheian> Now it's saying my event doesn't have preventDefault as a method T.T
[16:42:58] <Prometheian> also I removed the data-dismiss
[16:45:16] <Prometheian> I just threw in a return false and shit's working.
[16:45:29] <intothev01d> yep
[16:45:39] <intothev01d> you're not using a jQuery event so no preventDefault
[16:45:46] <intothev01d> so in this case return false
[16:47:08] <Prometheian> it works nice now, ty! ^^
[16:47:52] <intothev01d> false won't prevent bubbling of the event though, but in this case doesn't much matter
[17:11:37] <DreadKnight> intothev01d, yeah, someone from js channel helped me (posted there by accident first even if i use jquery, he fixed more stuff); apparently I had to use bind
[17:37:08] <ServerSa_> This might be more of a javascript question, but thought I'd start here.  If a string variable holds the NAME of a function, NOT a reference to the function, is it possible to call the function using the variable?
[17:43:57] <speed7> Hi All
[17:44:12] <systemfault> ServerSa_: Sometimes.
[17:44:37] <ServerSa_> systemfault: Figured it out actually.  window[variable];
[17:44:41] <systemfault> Yup :)
[17:44:47] <speed7> Anyone know if it is possible to filter a SELECT tag that is populated by mySQL in PHP?
[17:44:49] <ServerSa_> systemfault:   window[variable](); rather.  :)
[17:45:24] <speed7> I want to use jQuery to search in real time.
[17:45:24] <ServerSa_> systemfault: Is it possible to call namespace functions purely with variables?
[17:46:02] <systemfault> ServerSa_: You need to start from an object... or else, you might be able to do with something evil (like eval/new function)
[17:46:32] <ServerSa_> systemfault: Gag, no eval thanks.  :)
[17:46:55] <systemfault> speed7: You have full control over the DOM but it might be more efficient to filter it in the PHP controller.
[17:48:15] <speed7> systemfault hmm dam, I didnt really want to use PHP, but if that is the better way, I can try it. Will it be like jQuery? Real time searching?
[17:49:04] <systemfault> speed7: Depends on what you actually need to do... I don't have much information right now
[17:54:18] <Prometheian> I am trying to make a ko value change when I hit a button. I am trying to do it oddly, but is there a way I can make this work? http://www.hastebin.com/eyuyetasih.xml
[17:57:03] <Prometheian> nvm I'm not retarded any more
[18:01:49] <speed7> systemfault well, all i want to do is search inside the SELECT tag, and it should return the matching words
[18:11:28] <P0rk> How do you check if an input element is required using html5's required attribute?
[18:15:38] * P0rk taps on microphone..Is anybody out there?
[18:22:39] <BillCriswell> P0rk: Check what .prop('required') returns.
[18:26:02] <P0rk> BillCriswell, thanks. Simple enough...So I can filter like $(":input").filter(function () {return $(this).prop('required');});
[18:26:50] <BillCriswell> That can work. I think $('[required]') could do the trick as well.
[18:28:16] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/924zzgq7/
[18:29:02] <P0rk> Interesting that the selector property is added when directly selecting...never really thought about that before. Are there advantages to one way or the other?
[18:30:12] <BillCriswell> Advantages to what?
[18:30:30] <BillCriswell> Also, the :input on that selector isn't needed.
[18:31:10] <P0rk> Does it slow things down?
[18:32:08] <BillCriswell> :input would since jQuery couldn't use querySelectorAll for it.
[18:33:14] <P0rk> very cool. Would you happen to know of any validation engines that implement any of the html5 validation methods? I keep finding .live() in validation scripts...uggh
[18:33:46] <BillCriswell> P0rk: Not sure.
[18:34:17] <P0rk> cool.. I've been looking. Just hoping you had some direct personal experience. I'll keep googling. Thanks
[18:34:43] <BillCriswell> No problem at all.
[18:44:38] <P0rk> it's like nobody cared to write a validation engine in the last 2 years.
[18:50:30] <Unopoo> why $('#attr_dropdown').animate({color:'red'},'slow') didn't work?
[18:51:33] <BillCriswell> Unopoo: You need jQuery UI to animate colors.
[18:52:00] <BillCriswell> Unopoo: At this point in the game though a css transition might be a better choice.
[18:55:46] <Unopoo> BillCriswell: is there other ways to get around this?
[18:57:10] <BillCriswell> Include the parts of jQuery UI you need or use a CSS transition by just toggling a class.
[19:02:15] <BillCriswell> Unopoo: http://jsbin.com/lidecawibe/1/edit?css,js,output something like this
[20:03:11] <kinesis> Hi, if you view-source:dinbror.dk/bpopup/  you see ^F iframe (find word 'iframe') to example 5c there is a button that has a data attribute which feeds arguments to bPopup. data-bpopup='{"content":"iframe","contentContainer":".content","loadUrl":"http://dinbror.dk/blog"}'  - how would a .click() for that look, in which it takes all it's arguments from data-bpopup=""
[20:03:44] <kinesis> and is there a better js modal (non bootstrap) that works w/ IE6?
[20:04:13] <kinesis> the button is <span class="button small pop2"
[20:08:51] <kinesis> $("a.span_id_1, a.span_id_2").click(e){e.preventDefault; bPopup({<how do I feed the arguments from JSON embedded into html data attribute>});};
[22:52:09] <P0rk> do the .focus and .blur events propagate to the UL element if the inputs are in the ul's hierarchy?
[22:54:44] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/eq0avnkh/31/
[22:56:38] <norc> Hi. http://jsfiddle.net/dL1k4kuv/  -- why does this work with the onkeydown?
[22:57:07] <norc> I would expect the keydown callback to trigger a change event of Foo, which would subsequently clear the input.
[22:58:54] <norc> Or I guess I could simply use the mouseup event on #Foo.
[23:02:01] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/dL1k4kuv/3/
[23:02:06] <P0rk> norc ^^
[23:02:36] <P0rk> rather than set the selected property, just set the value of the select
[23:03:20] <P0rk> and I'm not sure about :selected or :checked....I guess it works with :checked
[23:05:27] <norc> P0rk: Why doesn't using .val() trigging the "onchange" event on #foo ?
[23:06:11] <P0rk> dunno for sure, but you would have to use .trigger to fire the change event
[23:07:24] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[23:30:35] <Cork> norc: .val() doesn't trigger onchange cause events is for user actions
[23:30:59] <Cork> norc: it never triggers from script actions, if it did you would easily cause infinite loops
[23:31:43] <Cork> .on('change', function() { $(this).val($(this).val().replace(' ', '')); }); <-- infinite loop?
[23:33:23] <norc> Cork: Gotcha that makes sense. So I would have to trigger the events manually with .trigger() if for some reason I wanted my code to trigger a JS event?
[23:33:34] <Cork> yes
[23:33:41] <norc> Thank you.
[23:39:36] <bloker> Hi, I am doing a window.open() on a long list of links. I am setting them by doing a $("#class").on('click'....)
[23:40:20] <bloker> i want the value of the onclick to be different each time, not a single link.
[23:40:26] <bloker> How do I make the link different?
[23:40:43] <Cork> uh
[23:40:49] <Cork> where do you get the link from?
[23:40:54] <bloker> how do I programmatically set a different value wen I set the onclick?
[23:43:49] <bloker> http://dpaste.com/19X3DXA
[23:43:54] <bloker> that is my code.
[23:44:05] <bloker> see how it sets the window.open value on line 5?
[23:44:32] <bloker> how do I make it a unique window.open() value in a loop?
[23:44:51] <Cork> simplest is to just use window.open(this.href)
[23:45:03] <Cork> as you have clicks on links
[23:46:13] <bloker> I need to look into this.href, not familiar with it.
[23:47:11] <Cork> bloker: it grabs the href from the link element
[23:47:24] <bloker> i see....that might work...
[23:47:34] <Cork> but ya it sounds like you should read up on the absolute basics of dom events
[23:47:35] <Unopoo> my website has a main banner shows on most pages, and today I added a close icon on it to let visitors close it, but how could I do this: if this is the first page of my site the visitor opened in browser, show the banner by default, now, if the visitor close the banner, then other pages' banner are closed to this visitor, too. so they don't need to close it again and again every my site's page opened, but still, if he close browser and reopen my site, the
[23:47:36] <Unopoo> default
[23:47:53] <Unopoo> It's not like a php session
[23:50:15] <doug64k> Unopoo: you can do that easily with a cookie
[23:51:17] <doug64k> Unopoo: when they click close, you set the "don't show" cookie. if you dont set an expiry then it will last until the browser is closed
[23:51:36] <doug64k> Unopoo: obviously you see if the dont show cookie is set before showing it
[23:52:06] <doug64k> give it a reasonable name, not "dont show" :D

[23:56:20] <shebbi> how to insert a tag inside another tag? i tried $.after() but that aint right
[23:56:40] <Cork> .append
[23:56:42] <Cork> or .prepend
[23:56:49] <Cork> depending on where you want it
[23:57:11] <shebbi> I want <a><b></a> <-- where b is inserted
