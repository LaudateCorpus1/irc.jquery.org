[02:23:56] <Cork> jak2000: if you have a question just ask it, don't ping ppl randomly
[03:25:19] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:26:48] <jomofcw> I'm trying to make my JS script load better. So I'll try to use "async" attribute as possible (good article there : http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html - Google seems to recommend the use of async instead of defer). But, how do you guys make sure that the jQuery Core script loaded before each other that will use it, please ?
[03:29:31] <Cork> jomofcw: the async attribute by definition doesn't give you execution order
[03:29:57] <Cork> so you can't have async set on jquery script loading unless you merge all scripts into one script file
[03:30:19] <Cork> a better option might be to just put the script at the end of the body
[03:30:37] <Cork> that means it will have sync execution (order) but not block rendering the content of the page
[03:34:09] <jomofcw> Morning Cork !
[03:35:05] <jomofcw> Cork yup putting it at the bottom of the body is what I'm doing curently. But it seems to be the old way to do it (we are old man :'() and seems to be not recommended anymore.
[03:35:31] <jomofcw> That's why I'm looking for some solution.
[03:36:05] <Cork> jomofcw: well it isn't recommended cause it puts scripts outside the header where it technically belong
[03:36:20] <Cork> jomofcw: but if you depend on the script loading before you run the rest you HAVE to
[03:36:35] <Cork> cause async means load and execute without blocking
[03:39:59] <jomofcw> Cork I agree, but nowaday, I have tyracking problem relating to JS load, and after a long search I see only this problem :S... so i try to feet the recommandation the best I can.
[03:40:12] <jomofcw> *tracking issues
[03:41:09] <Cork> jomofcw: well the only two options you have if you absolutely have to use async is: 1. load everyting into one script resource or 2. don't depend on jquery on page load
[03:44:22] <jomofcw> Cork OK ! And, as an hypothetic things... if I use "async" on ALL script[src] excepted the jQuery core one, can I be sure that jQuery will load first ?
[03:44:41] <jomofcw> [yea it will block the load, but seems to be not that heavy]
[03:44:45] <Cork> as long as it is before the other ones, sure
[03:44:59] <Cork> sync script loading means it will load and execute before the parser continues
[03:45:05] <jomofcw> Cork OK thanks. I will analyze all those stuff, and will find a solution. Thanks for your help :).
[03:48:42] <jomofcw> Another way to do it probably : is there a clean way to replace the "jQuery(function($) { myStuff });" to make it not depending of jQuery (so write in Core JS) but still ensure that "$" will be related to "jQuery" and nothing else in the function, please ?
[03:55:30] <Cork> jomofcw: no, not really
[03:55:56] <Cork> the closest thing that exists is document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {})
[03:56:14] <Cork> but i don't think it guarantees that jquery is loaded
[04:18:30] <ericP> i'm looking for an xlink with a specific href: <use xlink:href="#use-me" data-href="use-me"/>
[04:19:13] <ericP> $("#menu-button use[xlink:href='#up-arrow']") --> unrecognized expression
[04:20:19] <ericP> quotes aren't allowed in the attribute: $("#menu-button use['xlink:href'='#up-arrow']") --> unrecognized expression
[04:21:51] <ericP> i can give up and copy the href into a data-ref attr (as i showed above) and use $("#menu-button use[data-ref=up-arrow]") but that's a bit annoying from a DRY perspective
[04:22:04] <Cork> are you working with svg?
[04:22:36] <ericP> (apologies for mixing up "up-arrow" and "use-me" in the example and props to Bill Withers)
[04:22:43] <ericP> yep, svg in an html doc
[04:22:58] <ericP> drawing little bits of art to stick on buttons
[04:24:28] <ericP> <button id="controls-button"><svg><use .../></svg></button>
[04:27:45] <Cork> ericP: this is a way to do it, let me check if there is a way to query namespaces in jquery https://jsfiddle.net/dxgfy0L3/
[04:28:22] <jomofcw> Cork OK, thanks for your answers !
[04:29:17] <ericP> Cork, nice, many thanks!
[04:31:26] <ericP> the answer, for folks not following the link, is to fall back to a DOM function querySelectorAll('use[*|href="#up-arrow"]')
[04:35:28] <Cork> ericP: we usually try to keep the html/script outside the channel, as it becomes cluttered and hard to read
[04:35:57] <Cork> and if anyone cares in here they will just check the link
[04:36:44] <ericP> wilco
[04:38:48] <ericP> i'm puzzled about why it does The Right Thing with respect to searching in a context selection
[04:39:04] <Cork> what do you mean?
[04:39:32] <ericP> the MDN docs indicate that it's a search over the document
[04:39:48] <Cork> document.querySelectorAll sure
[04:39:53] <Cork> but not elm.querySelectorAll
[04:39:55] <ericP> but https://jsfiddle.net/dxgfy0L3/1/ shows that it limits its scope to a selection
[04:40:12] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll
[04:40:15] <ericP> ahh, i wasn't on the docs for the correct overloading of the function name
[04:40:16] <ericP> tx!
[04:40:35] <Cork> querySelectorAll is what jquery is using underneth for $() and .find()
[04:40:56] <Cork> it just overloads it with extra features like :first and the like
[04:41:04] <Cork> and that regex string can't handle namespaces
[04:42:02] <ericP> so need to make the call explicit. makes sense
[05:05:15] <ericP> Cork, is there a list of the stuff outside of querySelectorAll supported by find()? (i.e. :first and the like)
[05:05:38] <Cork> ericP: everything with a colon if front of them
[05:06:04] <Cork> psudo-class and psudo-elements selectors aren't supported by querySelector or querySelectorAll
[05:06:57] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[05:07:39] <ericP> huh, not a surprise that the code that break up the selector on psudo-elements gets a bit confused by prefixed attributes
[05:07:56] <ericP> s/break up/cracks/
[05:09:07] <ericP> i wonder if these will get absorbed by the DOM function (at which point my use case might be screwed)
[05:10:33] <ericP> it'd be pretty ugly to say that you can query with prefixed name as long as the localName is not confusable with a psudo-elements
[05:13:07] <Cork> ericP: there are work ongoing to be able to handle psudo elements and classes in dom methods
[05:13:23] <Cork> not sure it will be in the querySelector or somewhere though
[05:13:33] <Cork> (i think the project is called hudini)
[05:15:48] <ericP> https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts
[05:21:28] <stennowork> good day, assuming i have a listener bound to a certain event (on an element). If i now register a second event, does it a) override the first event or b) execute them in order? What i would like precisely to conditionally trigger the first listener in my second callback.
[05:21:49] <stennowork> think 'monkeypatching of events'
[05:22:33] <Uhkis> b)
[05:22:58] <stennowork> hmm ok
[05:23:13] <Cork> stennowork: event handlers are processed in order, and then bubbling up the parent tree
[05:23:25] <Cork> so first on the top most element and then the parent and so on
[05:24:03] <stennowork> so how about: get the currently registered listeners registered to the event on the element, then remove the listeners, and wrap them in my own listener callback?
[05:24:23] <Cork> rename won't work
[05:24:31] <stennowork> hrm
[05:24:45] <Cork> and you can only query event handlers bound by jquery, as the dom don't have a way to get bound elements
[05:24:59] <Cork> *bound event handlers
[05:25:07] <stennowork> yeah, this assumes all handlers bound by jquery
[05:25:25] <stennowork> yep, the event DOM stuff is pretty awful
[05:25:32] <Cork> it is what jquery uses
[05:25:48] <Cork> it just stores references to event type and function bound before it pass it on to the dom
[05:25:53] <stennowork> sure, but there is some abstraction over it
[05:26:04] <stennowork> right, thats missing in the vanilla DOM stuff
[05:26:26] <Cork> there is an unofficial, and not supported way to access what event handlers has been bound it is through $._data(elm, 'events')
[05:26:37] <stennowork> in vanilla you can basically just register an event listener, and unregister it by passing the fnuction reference
[05:26:41] <stennowork> hmm i see
[05:26:50] <Cork> you could grab those unbind them from the event and then bind them again or call them your self
[05:26:54] <stennowork> unofficial and unsupported doesn't sound good :P
[05:26:59] <Cork> ya
[05:27:00] <stennowork> right, thats what i wanted to do
[05:27:10] <Cork> it is there so jquery can do its .off() function
[05:27:14] <Cork> but it isn't an api
[05:27:15] <Uhkis> maybe show some code and lets think of an alternative way to do it?
[05:27:16] <stennowork> alright, thanks for the headsup, i will figure something out
[05:27:19] <Cork> so you aren't suppose to use it
[05:27:33] <Cork> ya, if possible that is a better solution
[05:28:37] <stennowork> ok, my specific use case is using jquery datatables extensions: https://datatables.net/reference/event/
[05:29:10] <stennowork> here i want to avoid that the search request to the server side (i use server side processing/pagination) is triggered unless the search string has at least a length of 3
[05:29:21] <stennowork> this is the relevant event https://datatables.net/reference/event/search
[05:29:34] <stennowork> and here is the relevant api call https://datatables.net/reference/api/search()
[05:30:15] <stennowork> i can try to unregister the current event listener, then call search myself
[05:30:59] <stennowork> i just hoped that i don't have to re-implement the current, 'built-in' search trigger
[05:31:36] <stennowork> i hope its as easy as it its mentioned in the example
[05:31:37] <Cork> stennowork: i would look into what the search function does internally
[05:31:40] <stennowork> then it would be no problem
[05:31:55] <stennowork> Cork, yeah, but i hope i could avoid  that :P but it has to be, i guess :)
[05:31:59] <Cork> there might be a callback or something like that that lets you override this cleanly
[05:32:14] <stennowork> right
[05:32:15] <Uhkis> i actually did similar with datatables using off()
[05:33:07] <Uhkis> but, you could just take the original search field off with the dom property while initializing it and implement your own search field
[05:34:56] <stennowork> maybe just setting searchDelay is enough
[05:35:00] <stennowork> i think thats fine
[05:35:32] <stennowork> hmm its already set to 400ms by default
[05:36:03] <stennowork> Uhkis, did you use server side processing/pagination too?
[05:36:22] <Uhkis> no
[05:36:30] <stennowork> was replicating the built-in functionality as simple as its implied by the example?
[05:36:31] <stennowork> ah damn
[05:37:19] <stennowork> well i will just try it and see and read sources as suggested o7
[05:37:26] * stennowork puts on his investigation helmet
[05:37:40] <Uhkis> https://datatables.net/reference/api/search()#Example you could just add: if ($(this).text().length > 2) { search() }
[05:38:25] <Uhkis> wait what, this.value.length of course :D
[05:38:36] <stennowork> yeah thats the example i meant, i just hope it does all the things implied by serverSide (i.e. building the request thats fired and handling the response data itself)
[05:38:56] <stennowork> thats what i try out now! wish me luck
[05:39:48] <Uhkis> i once took a peek at the serverside things and quit instantly after seeing how much more work there is to it :D
[05:40:12] <stennowork> its really not that much work
[05:40:43] <stennowork> just because we use an outdated database in the backend, i cannot do it as cool as i wanted to be
[05:42:52] <stennowork> and the required response fields force me to fire a count() query to count all possible dataset, then fire a second query which does fulltext filtering, and then do the actual pagination programmatically
[05:43:08] <stennowork> because i also have to get the result count of the filtered set
[07:47:14] <puddle> hi I am using selectize to make selects multiselects and it works fine but I would like to create a select all button. Here is the code which should work: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1e756edae01e50888832edb548b70337
[07:47:48] <puddle> the important part is the get block (more importantly line 47-57)
[07:48:14] <puddle> the console.log(selectize) statement logs undefined and I have no idea why
[07:48:54] <Cork> puddle: you want .eq(0) not [0]
[07:49:05] <Cork> [0] gives you the raw dom element, and plugins doesn't exist on those
[07:49:18] <puddle> ow gona try that thanks
[07:50:34] <puddle> Cork, thanks it isnt undefined now but i get an error: Uncaught TypeError: selectize.setValue is not a function
[07:50:57] <Cork> ya, cause selectize is a function
[07:51:12] <crazycoder> hello
[07:51:28] <Cork> puddle: where have you gotten setValue from?
[07:51:31] <crazycoder> guys how can i get the absolute path of a $('a') IF it is relative?
[07:51:37] <Cork> cause normally plugins doesn't work like that
[07:51:53] <puddle> Cork, https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/api.md
[07:52:03] <Cork> ah...
[07:52:14] <Cork> so it is extending the dom element :/
[07:52:45] <Cork> donno why it is undefined then
[07:53:00] <Cork> crazycoder: path?
[07:53:08] <Cork> or position?
[07:53:10] <crazycoder> Cork, URL
[07:53:11] <crazycoder> pardon
[07:53:17] <crazycoder> href
[07:53:20] <Cork> ah .prop('href')
[07:53:23] <puddle> Cork any tips perhaps?
[07:53:42] <Cork> puddle: i could have a look if you could create a working example in jsfiddle.net
[07:54:08] <crazycoder> perfect!
[07:58:32] <puddle> Cork, I tried to make a working example but the code is just a bit too complex to do that
[07:58:44] <Cork> it is?
[07:58:46] <Cork> why?
[07:58:55] <puddle> https://jsfiddle.net/n1qvmw0d/
[07:59:01] <puddle> this should work as an example
[07:59:09] <puddle> well not
[07:59:13] <puddle> its in a modal crap
[07:59:30] <Cork> ya, no reason to have underscore as a dependency
[07:59:43] <Cork> just add the select statically in the html section
[07:59:53] <Cork> it isn't what you have problem with anyway
[08:03:38] <puddle> Cork, thanks for the help anyways!
[08:35:39] <WebDevB> Hey guys, I've created a simple map with Google and also added my markers to it... I'm wanting to add a search box to this and for that to search through my markers... Does anyone know if this is possibe?
[10:47:42] <JrWebDev> how do i write this correctly : .... $(this).$(".deletePDF").val()
[10:48:15] <localh0st> JrWebDev: $(this).find(".deletePDF").val()
[10:48:23] <JrWebDev> awesome let me see if it works
[10:48:27] <localh0st> if ".deletePDF" is children of $(this)
[10:48:49] <JrWebDev> umm...theres multiple buttons with different values but with same class name
[10:49:24] <localh0st> you need to show me html
[10:49:43] <localh0st> and tell what element are you clicking on and what value are you going to get
[10:56:33] <WebDevB> Hey, I'm using google maps to add a search box to a map but I also need to add all my markers too it.
[10:56:43] <WebDevB> This is what I'm trying but it's not like it
[10:57:20] <Mad_Dud> hi guys, is there an official security best practicies for jquery, which encourages to patch and use the moste recent version?
[10:57:43] <WebDevB> https://codeshare.io/GqnOXM
[10:57:51] <JrWebDev> nah that didnt work localh0st
[10:57:51] <WebDevB> Can anyone help me add the markers too?
[10:59:02] <localh0st> JrWebDev: html...
[10:59:33] <JrWebDev> to keep things short....html is basically <button value="1" onclick="deletePDF()"></button> where value is 1 2 3 4 5 til 20
[11:00:01] <JrWebDev> to keep things short....html is basically <button value="1" onclick="deletePDF()" class="whatever"></button>
[11:00:19] <JrWebDev> so $(this).find(".whatever").val() didnt work
[11:01:32] <taplar> Mad_Dud: in general from a security standpoint, any third party software that you use should be periodically reviewed for updates, evaluated if the new versions have any new security concerns, and if not older versions updated to the newer versions.
[11:02:47] <taplar> JrWebDev: what is 'this' in that context?
[11:03:00] <localh0st> that's ugly, why can't you change it to something like:
[11:03:26] <JrWebDev> in my mind this means this button..the one button that i clicked
[11:03:37] <taplar> so it's in a click handler for buttons?
[11:03:57] <taplar> or is it inside that deletePDF() that you are calling?
[11:04:18] <JrWebDev> i dont think i have a handler
[11:04:40] <localh0st> JrWebDev: https://pastebin.com/tNc9EVRu
[11:05:55] <JrWebDev> okay localh0st let me try that
[11:06:30] <Mad_Dud> taplar, i agree. i'm just looking for an official statement from jquery so that i can quote them
[11:06:42] <taplar> that's not a jquery thing
[11:06:44] <taplar> that's a security thing
[11:06:56] <taplar> you'd be better looking for a statement from like OWASP
[11:10:00] <taplar> JrWebDev:  if you are using inline bindings it would be something like https://jsfiddle.net/89pxwjov/
[11:11:13] <JrWebDev> taplar, you put a z..instead of s is that correct?  this vs thiz
[11:11:25] <WebDevB> Anyone help? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44592474/google-map-markers-with-search
[11:11:27] <taplar> 'this' is a reserved word in javascript
[11:11:27] <JrWebDev> yeah it should taplar
[11:13:43] <JrWebDev> taplar, that value=1 has to travel into the javascript code..cause when i click button i have to take that value and run an ajax request
[11:13:59] <taplar> which is what that fiddle shows
[11:14:02] <JrWebDev> ajax request will post it out using a .php file
[11:14:10] <taplar> look at the console as you click the button
[11:14:18] <JrWebDev> ah ok ok
[11:14:19] <JrWebDev> hold on
[11:17:58] <JrWebDev> perfect taplar
[11:18:02] <JrWebDev> thank you so much
[11:18:18] <JrWebDev> localh0st, thank you too..im saving this example as well
[11:18:53] <taplar> i would agree with localh0st though that in general you want to do your bindings not inline when possible
[11:19:50] <taplar> some frameworks rely on inline bindings or pseudo inline bindings though, so it's still good to know about them
[11:21:33] <Mad_Dud> taplar: that might be true, but other libraries, like angularjs, have official statements on their websites about patching recommendations.
[11:22:09] <taplar> *shrug*  you might ask around #jquery-dev then to see if they have such a thing
[11:22:45] <taplar> or #jquery-content
[11:22:45] <Mad_Dud> thank you
[11:24:50] <JrWebDev> so that was inline binding okay..i have to learn some terms..i still dont know what a handler is really etc. but i have to get familiar with these key terms
[11:26:10] <Uhkis> JrWebDev: something happens and the handler says "ill handle it!" :D
[11:28:05] <JrWebDev> makes sense :D
[11:29:10] <JrWebDev> thanks for all your help guys

[11:38:20] <ServerSage> Hey folks, I have a dialog with a bunch of links. When I show the dialog the first link gets focus, and I can't figure out how to stop it. Any ideas?
[11:39:54] <ServerSage> Ha, idiot. Had I read the top of the dialog documentation I'd have had my answer.
[11:47:21] <catbadger>  Has anyone else seen the new Chrome 59 bug in interactjs?
[12:30:03] <impliednude> So, event delegation is basically a hook that you're extending right?
[12:32:25] <shoky> depends what you mean by "hook" and "extending"...  it's listening for events on a parent/ancestor element, that bubble up from descendant elements
[14:42:06] <Es0teric> question -- how do i remove this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'contents' of null ? i have an ajaxComplete that checks xhr for responseText, but the object that runs a refresh method has its own ajax call and it seems that is interfering with the ajaxComplete
[14:45:45] <robertmaxrees> whatever is checking contents needs to first check if the parent object exists.
[14:46:11] <Es0teric> how do i do that?
[14:46:24] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways.
[14:46:32] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code you have now doing that check?
[14:47:27] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://kopy.io/WlsjB
[14:48:06] <robertmaxrees> if (response_text && response_textr.contents) {}
[14:49:15] <Es0teric> oh snap, that works... thanks!
[16:29:02] <JrWebDev> i have table rows with a href links... how can a have ...lets say an edit button next to the link...and edit the name of the file...would require ajax to a php script to actually rename etc...but...how do i click the edit button and create a text input over the link where i can begin writing
[16:39:22] <knew2this> Can someone help me with this message when I try to put the jquery.js in my main folder
[16:39:57] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev using an event handler.

[16:41:07] <robertmaxrees> *thing
[16:41:19] <knew2this> I am using sinatra
[16:42:00] <robertmaxrees> knew2this that usually means the content-type header and the actual file have a mismatch.
[16:42:16] <robertmaxrees> i would fix the server to use the correct content-type http header.
[16:42:55] <knew2this> can you give me the correct way to src it?  Should I do <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
[16:42:58] <knew2this> is that required?
[16:43:11] <robertmaxrees> knew2this that's not where the issue lies :)
[16:43:21] <robertmaxrees> it's the way your server is sending the file to the browser.
[16:43:30] <knew2this> damn how can I fix that?
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> gotta figure out why sinatra is using the wrong headers.
[16:43:51] <robertmaxrees> \
[16:44:00] <robertmaxrees> *search the sinatra docs for more info.
[16:44:38] <JrWebDev> such as how robertmaxrees
[16:44:48] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev not sure what that question means.
[16:44:54] <robertmaxrees> you use an event handler to show the input.
[16:45:23] <JrWebDev> i want to rename a list of files that are downloadable...u know... a list with anchor tags...<a href>
[16:45:33] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[16:45:42] <robertmaxrees> so where are you lost? :)
[16:46:20] <JrWebDev> how should it be done.... ima give an example
[16:46:29] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:46:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:46:47] <JrWebDev> click me to download a doc     [edit]     X
[16:46:56] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't work in irc :)
[16:46:58] <robertmaxrees> use jsfiddle.
[16:47:05] <robertmaxrees> and show some code.
[16:47:11] <JrWebDev> i dont have code right now
[16:47:19] <robertmaxrees> not even html?
[16:47:20] <JrWebDev> concept first
[16:47:33] <JrWebDev> no im sketching it all down first
[16:47:46] <robertmaxrees> erm, okay?
[16:47:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:47:54] <robertmaxrees> then how are we supposed to help?
[16:48:10] <JrWebDev> now if you click that edit button...i want click me to download a doc to now show an input box....should i simply just over lap an input box and begin typing
[16:48:20] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev i can't click anything.
[16:48:23] <JrWebDev> so that i can rename that file
[16:48:26] <robertmaxrees> it's jkust text.
[16:48:33] <JrWebDev> come on you get the concept
[16:48:48] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean that's just the text you'd use.  got it.
[16:48:58] <JrWebDev> yeah...
[16:49:04] <robertmaxrees> that wasn't apparent to me initially ;)
[16:49:07] <JrWebDev> click edit..then you can rename that file
[16:49:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'd show the input positioned over the anchor.
[16:49:18] <robertmaxrees> probably prefill it with the original name.
[16:49:34] <JrWebDev> right then ajax request to do some server side code to change
[16:49:40] <JrWebDev> etc.
[16:49:43] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:50:09] <JrWebDev> okay so the best thing would be to overlap an input box... just wanting to make sure if that was sane
[16:50:26] <robertmaxrees> or you couild hide the link and show the input.
[16:50:27] <JrWebDev> or is there an easier library or soemthing thats way easier?
[16:50:38] <JrWebDev> booyah..hide the link and show the inputbox..even better
[16:50:53] <JrWebDev> there u go robertmaxrees smart man thanks
[16:50:53] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/contentEditable may also be an option.
[16:50:57] <JrWebDev> im new to this
[16:51:13] <JrWebDev> never did a file rename to a web page
[16:51:27] <robertmaxrees> heh, neither have i ;)
[16:51:56] <JrWebDev> lol
[16:52:00] <JrWebDev> but its a great concept
[16:52:04] <JrWebDev> that u have
[16:52:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd search inline text editor on google.
[16:52:06] <JrWebDev> thanks
[16:52:11] <robertmaxrees> there's probnably a ton of better ideas out there.
[16:52:13] <robertmaxrees> or plugins.
[16:52:28] <JrWebDev> right im trying to find which is the best ones
[16:52:35] <JrWebDev> which are the best ones
[16:52:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:52:52] <robertmaxrees> the one that';s right for your particular application/.
[16:53:14] <JrWebDev> true robertmaxrees
[16:53:26] <robertmaxrees> so long as it's compatible with whatever other dependencies you've got and it's reasonably up to date.
[16:53:27] <JrWebDev> thanks for your help though
[16:53:33] <JrWebDev> true robertmaxrees
[18:52:18] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeee
[19:51:46] <L|t_> anyone know of a way to style all check boxes with jquery?
[20:07:07] <robertmaxrees> L|t_ why would you do that?
[20:07:31] <robertmaxrees> why not use CSS?
[20:07:34] <L|t_> modern day styling using the label tricks
[20:07:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:07:51] <L|t_> The code is all written and its alot of damn work.
[20:08:04] <robertmaxrees> still not following.
[20:08:15] <L|t_> To add the labels and unique id names into all the correct formating positions
[20:08:29] <robertmaxrees> you can still use CSS to style them.
[20:08:40] <robertmaxrees> i mean, jquery has a .css() method.
[20:08:44] <L|t_> Yes I have started it.
[20:08:49] <robertmaxrees> just seems silly to use it when you can just use native css.
[20:09:58] <L|t_> Example?
[20:10:12] <L|t_> I have 50 check boxes just for languages
[20:11:06] <L|t_> 21 other options like that.
[20:11:18] <L|t_> That i would like to convert to a modern look.
[20:11:56] <L|t_> I have wondering if anyone knew of a function that looks for check boxes and formats the code in the page for the css.
[20:12:33] <L|t_> Most of the styling uses labels in speciifc positions? right? with specific naming conventions (id's)
[20:24:22] <badcss> Hi guys, I'm struggling with an each function that calculates something based off variables in the div, can anyone give me a hand
[20:26:31] <badcss> https://jsfiddle.net/tbpzwdez/1/
[21:08:05] <L|t_> why would this line not be working $('[data-id="' + selectionID + '"]').remove();
