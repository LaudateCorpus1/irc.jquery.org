[00:26:28] <fancy> Hey guys, if I have a on click listener on an element
[00:26:46] <fancy> how can I use the click() function and have it bypass my listener?
[00:27:15] <fancy> Basically I'm using these third party sliders, but there is no way to toggle them, so I have to simulate clicks.
[00:27:42] <fancy> but I want them to act as radio buttons, so when I click on one, the others turn off.
[01:40:24] <oaulakh> will anyone tell why i am getting error with my page? https://dpaste.de/4CJF
[01:41:41] <oaulakh> will anyone tell why i am getting error with my page? https://dpaste.de/4CJF on line no.12 and it's throwing error that jQuery is not defined?
[03:04:11] <amriunix> hi! is there is any jquey plugin can preview text files from remote server ! like the way hoow pdf.js can do that!
[07:19:33] <tocka> could someone explain how this website makes the photos move a bit when you scroll down and when they enter your viewport? :| http://www.eginstill.com/ I cant figure it out..
[08:04:44] <Antraxis> tocka: erm, photos use parallax scrolling (which uses css transform 3d in this case)
[09:38:18] <aro> is there a way to select all elements that have a specific data key?
[09:38:23] <aro> like data-help-id=
[09:39:12] <aro> i basically want to grab all elements that have a specific data key
[09:39:17] <aro> regardless of value
[09:44:04] <aro> is that possible?
[09:47:01] <shoky> [attribute-name]
[09:56:23] <fancy> Hey guys
[09:57:09] <aro> cool thanks
[09:57:24] <aro> is there a way to parse the entire page and replace things in the dom that match a regex?
[09:57:38] <aro> like if i have <p>This is a{HELPID:128} test</p>
[09:57:45] <aro> basically match that {HELPID:128} block
[09:57:47] <fancy> If I have a selector that returns multiple items
[09:58:06] <fancy> How can I loop through them and check equality with another element?
[09:58:18] <fancy> Even if I could just get their ids, that would be great.
[10:18:09] <aro> is there an easy way to find/replace text in the dom without repasting the entire html body back to itself
[12:05:29] <xenaxon> hi
[12:05:33] <xenaxon> hi !
[12:05:47] <xenaxon> I have a small issue with DATEPICKER
[12:06:23] <xenaxon> can someone tell me how to make it appear below the input and just stay there? I just want it to be always visible below the input. don't want it to appear on hover
[12:07:50] <xenaxon> anybody have any idea how to do that?
[12:18:07] <shoky> http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#inline
[12:19:48] <xenaxon> shoky: yea, but I wan't to keep the input! because I use it in the form, to pass the date...
[12:20:04] <xenaxon> shoky: with div method you showed me... the input is gone.
[12:21:16] <xenaxon> somebody please help. I am appending multiple elements to a div using the JQUERY append method, and it's not functioning correctly
[12:21:25] <xenaxon> the order mixes up
[12:21:44] <xenaxon> sometimes the first is second and the second is third and the third is first, and so on
[12:21:56] <xenaxon> every time I refresh... it's different
[12:22:13] <xenaxon> and this shouldn't be happening because I'm using $.each
[12:29:58] <shoky> xenaxon: so you can add an input and keep it synced with the datepicker (via events)
[12:30:31] <shoky> and about your problem - make a jsfiddle
[13:09:00] <xenaxon> When I trigger the window.print action, it opens up the Print Dialog
[13:09:30] <xenaxon> and when I click CANCEL, it reloads the page... why does it do that?
[13:12:48] <sillyslux> chrome 51 doesn't
[15:09:36] <madhatter_> is there a way you can use variables in creating a json array object in jquery
[19:55:13] <thomaxo> Hi Jquery!
[19:55:15] <thomaxo> Strange issue, for some reason this doesn't work.
[19:55:17] <thomaxo>  $("modal").click(function() {
[19:55:19] <thomaxo>         alert("Handler for .click() called.");
[19:55:21] <thomaxo>     });
[19:55:30] <thomaxo> with <modal> ... </modal>
[20:02:00] <thomaxo> oh nvm it works with inline html, not the main.js file. strange!
