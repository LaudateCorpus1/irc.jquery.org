[03:13:10] <Justice> I'm trying to chain promises but how can i input the resovle of one promise into next in chain?
[03:24:51] <Cork> Justice: .then(function(data) { return data.partial }).then(function(partial) { return partial.user }).then(function(user) { console.log(user.name); })
[03:28:06] <Cork> Justice: https://jsfiddle.net/47mcb0nb/
[03:29:09] <Justice> hm
[03:29:36] <dijenerate> hi all
[03:30:30] <dijenerate> is this the place to ask a quick question about jquery-ui autocomplete?
[03:30:56] <Cork> dijenerate: yup
[03:31:12] <dijenerate> awesome
[03:31:25] <dijenerate> so I'm inserting an object into the dom after it is initialized
[03:31:32] <dijenerate> css styling etc all work just fine
[03:31:49] <dijenerate> but I cannot for the life of me get autocomplete to work
[03:32:03] <Cork> ya, you need to initialize autocomplete on each instance
[03:32:09] <Cork> so if you add a new one you will have to run it on it
[03:32:20] <dijenerate> I've even tried the standard default example here: https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#default
[03:33:23] <Cork> or you can do what i often do in those cases and style the field statically, and then bind the autocomplete on focus
[03:33:53] <dijenerate> you mean like this: $("#tag").css({ position: "absolute", color: "rgb(80, 187, 231)", "text-align": "left", outline:" none", cursor: "text", "border": "1px solid rgba(43, 98, 174, 0.3)" }).autocomplete({ source: availableTags });
[03:33:56] <Cork> and then run autocomplete('destroy') on blur
[03:34:10] <Cork> not really no
[03:34:34] <dijenerate> oh... ok, what am I doing wrong here?
[03:37:52] <Cork> dijenerate: https://jsfiddle.net/wk2tvzkx/
[03:38:21] <Cork> all inputs with the autocomplete-dynamic class and appended inside that div will have a working autocomplete
[03:39:03] <Cork> dijenerate: the reason you don't want to do it in .css() is that then it won't catch them automatically
[03:41:36] <dijenerate> Cork: ah, ok. ok... so let the trigger be user activity directly but just early enough to init before it's needed
[03:56:16] <Justice> Cork, hm odd jsfiddle was breaking for me but now it seems to work but in the chain if they simple add the resolve of each hm
[03:56:48] <Cork> Justice: its the difference between .then and .done
[03:57:02] <Justice> just playing with these atm; https://jsfiddle.net/o7tjwtja/
[03:57:03] <Justice> i see
[03:57:08] <Cork> then always modifies the deferred, so after it if you don't return anything you will have null
[03:57:16] <Cork> (or rather undefined)
[03:57:16] <dijenerate> Cork: thanks very much... got it working with: $("#tag").css({ position: "absolute", color: "rgb(80, 187, 231)", "text-align": "left", outline:" none", cursor: "text", "border": "1px solid rgba(43, 98, 174, 0.3)" }).unbind("focus").on("focus", function(){ var availableTags = [ "ActionScript", "AppleScript", "Asp", "BASIC", "C", "C++", "Clojure", "COBOL", "ColdFusion", "Erlang", "Fortran", "Groovy", "Haskell", "Java",
[03:57:16] <dijenerate> "JavaScript", "Lisp", "Perl", "PHP", "Python", "Ruby", "Scala", "Scheme" ]; $(this).autocomplete({ source: availableTags }); }).unbind("blur").on("blur", function(){ $(this).autocomplete('destroy'); });
[03:57:27] <Cork> ugg...
[03:57:31] <dijenerate> lol
[03:57:35] <Cork> dijenerate: don't paste long scripts in the channel
[03:57:37] <Cork> use jsfiddle
[03:57:59] <dijenerate> yeah, I think after that, I definitely will
[03:58:03] <dijenerate> np
[03:58:25] <Cork> Justice: that es6 promise though, it is very similar to deferred, but not exactly
[03:59:33] <Justice> true.
[04:00:05] <Cork> and to be honest i find deferred to be a better model
[04:01:40] <Justice> btw you know what will happen with deffered or will they run together with promises now that they are being used more and more?
[04:02:02] <Cork> jquery deferred is compatible with es6 promise
[04:02:18] <Cork> so you can give a promise to jquery and it will work
[04:02:28] <Cork> and you can get a pure promise from a jquery deferred
[04:02:42] <Cork> don't think there is any plan to go further then that
[04:04:04] <Cork> similar to how .data haven't been removed when dataset landed in native dom
[04:07:44] <Deusdeorum> How can I detect a change on a span when text is updated? https://jsfiddle.net/y8owsynd/
[04:08:16] <Cork> Deusdeorum: have the caller call a function to notify you
[04:08:46] <Deusdeorum> Cork but why would something like on('change', func... not work here?
[04:08:58] <Cork> cause it isn't a form element
[04:09:13] <Deusdeorum> so on change etc only works for inputs?
[04:09:30] <Cork> and it only triggers on user actions
[04:09:50] <Cork> events is for scripts to react to user action, not to detect other scripts
[04:16:28] <Deusdeorum> hmm, i see Cork, well.. I have a slider which updates a hidden div with a value. I'd like to style the slider when value changes. So I thought I could just detect text change in the hidden div but I guess it's not that simple.
[04:16:56] <Cork> Deusdeorum: just detect the change event on the slider
[05:53:59] <Wian> Hi Everyone
[05:54:30] <Wian> I have a Javascript that uses if statements that works correclty in HTML5 format
[05:54:49] <Wian> i need to convert this to Jquery and use it in my databaseweb application
[05:55:02] <Wian> can someone perhaps assist me?
[06:00:40] <Wian> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=4wfL0EIyzA this is my current code but i need to change it to pull info from my precreated form on my web app
[06:24:09] <itsgokul> why does a script stop responding and hang using LiveValidation 1.3 by Alec Hill MIT license
[07:35:18] <Deusdeorum> can i combine mouseleave and click? I have a draggable div that i would want to bind to fire a script when it's "dragged"
[07:35:50] <Deusdeorum> using click will not fire if you have it in draggable mode and leave the div, but you can still drag it
[07:38:41] <Cork> Deusdeorum: you would have to fire on mousedown and then bind a mousemove handler on the document to catch how it moves
[07:39:22] <Deusdeorum> Cork ty
[07:40:46] <niels_> Jquery-ui seems almost dead. What's the verdict?
[07:45:05] <Cork> niels_: its quite active if you check the github at least
[07:45:23] <Cork> niels_: and it got new features last year if i remember correctly
[07:45:39] <Cork> so i would say it is going quite well actualy
[07:45:44] <niels_> last commit is May 31
[07:46:23] <Cork> ya, and that isn't bad
[07:46:50] <niels_> Maybe true, it's just hard to evaluate how alive a project really is.
[07:47:02] <Cork> not really
[07:47:24] <Cork> does it work with the latest version of the dependency it relies on, if it does then it is in good state
[07:48:04] <niels_> That's one measure. Another is number of open bugs.
[07:48:18] <Cork> and then one might have to check up the dependency chain to make sure none of them has gone dead
[07:48:37] <Deusdeorum> isn't there different branches?
[07:48:38] <Cork> not really bugs is only a state on how many mistakes are found
[07:48:48] <Cork> not for ui
[07:48:54] <Cork> there might be forks though
[07:49:17] <Deusdeorum> true, i like when there's master and dev branches
[07:49:28] <niels_> If development is slow, if there are few developers, if there are few users, then I might use something else.
[07:49:38] <niels_> I use Jquery all the time, no problem.
[07:49:40] <Cork> that only makes sense if anyone is developing directly in the repo
[07:50:28] <Cork> heh https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/network
[07:51:05] <niels_> heh, how should we interpret that?
[07:51:27] <Cork> that github has a less then optimal way to handle many forks :)
[07:51:45] <niels_> 4647 is a fair amount
[07:52:14] <Cork> ya, but not being able to get a single one as a consequence is...
[07:57:03] <pokmo> is '.el' a naming convention or a special keyword?
[07:59:10] <niels_> I'd say naming convention, depending on context
[08:07:52] <pokmo> right
[08:58:16] <pokmo> sometimes i see code like function() { window.a = window.a || {};...} what does window.a = window.a || {} do?
[08:58:57] <MikeD_> that makes sure there is something at window.a ... either whatever was there already... or a literal object
[08:59:14] <pokmo> oh right
[09:00:30] <MikeD_> be careful with that || trick though
[09:02:48] <MikeD_> if you have something like var myfoo = a.foo || b.foo  it'll work as expected when a.foo is undefined (you get b.foo) or if a.foo is a "truthy" value... but if a.foo was ever a literal zero, that's falsey and you get b.foo... even when a.foo HAS a value... so yeah it's an edge case, but the || pattern does fall apart at this edge case
[09:03:08] <MikeD_> literal false is also falsey
[09:04:15] <MikeD_> if you're using it as a guard against undefined, i'd suggest a more explicit:  var myfoo = ( a.foo === undefined ? b.foo : a.foo );
[09:04:16] <pokmo> yep
[09:04:18] <pokmo> thanks
[09:07:22] <Deusdeorum> how does closest() work? will it only look for closest in same level?
[09:08:31] <MikeD_> closest self or ancestor
[09:09:02] <MikeD_> it's not a "look around for shortest distance"  (which some of my coworkers have imagined it to be)
[09:09:27] <Deusdeorum> that's what I think it is. Is there such a function?
[09:10:04] <MikeD_> describe what you are trying to accomplish
[09:11:02] <MikeD_> there is .siblings() which is a lot like .parent().find(something) but it specifically excludes the self object
[09:12:33] <Deusdeorum> MikeD_ i'll create fiddle. But basically i would like to do something with closest div which is not inside current div
[09:12:52] <Deusdeorum> do i actually have to do .parent().parent().find() ?
[09:13:19] <sahbeewah> closest how
[09:13:41] <Deusdeorum> sahbeewah ye exactly. closes which is in the same parent div
[09:14:03] <MikeD_> if you have the current div and you want the .next() one after it, that's as close as the .previous()
[09:15:21] <sahbeewah> like, adjacent nodes?
[09:15:25] <MikeD_> sorry, .prev() vs .next()
[09:22:53] <Deusdeorum> MikeD_ sahbeewah cant figure it out in a fiddle. but i got this https://snag.gy/AxadzN.jpg
[09:23:48] <Deusdeorum> $('#slider-callout-531659X4617X701336')..on("DOMSubtreeModified",function(){ //do something with closest .progress-div });
[09:25:44] <Deusdeorum> obviously thought about $(this).closest('.progress-div') but got stuck as it is not working
[09:28:59] <Deusdeorum> Am I making sense?
[10:15:24] <MikeD_> sorry, we had a very long scrum today
[10:16:37] <MikeD_> what about $(this).next(".slider-helptext").find('progress-div")  ?
[10:16:54] <MikeD_> missed the dot in the find, you get the idea
[10:16:56] <Deusdeorum> MikeD_ dnk what that means, but i ended up doing .parent().parent().parent().next('.target').find('progress-div') feels really ugly
[10:17:49] <Deusdeorum> yours is much less ugly :D
[10:18:13] <MikeD_> the multiple parent thing is a little wierd... that's really what closest() is for... you can ask for the .closest/* ancestor that is a */ ( ".foo")
[10:20:24] <Deusdeorum> MikeD_ ah, thanks! what is this 'scrum'? :-)
[10:22:14] <MikeD_> the team gets together in the morning to discuss yesterday and the plan for today
[10:22:25] <Deusdeorum> ah, cool!
[10:22:52] <MikeD_> we ended up very much off-task from scrum (supposed to be 15 minutes or less) and discussed engineering plans that should have happened 2 years ago that we still haven't made a priority
[10:23:14] <MikeD_> we've spent too much time working in opposite directions and it's starting to fray our codebase
[10:24:54] <Deusdeorum> I see, like lots of things that should have priority but you never have time doing it. you work at where your whois is? :-)
[10:26:48] <MikeD_> hmm... that was an interesting phrase to parse...  nope, my realname is not 'purple' (no idea where that comes from) and apparently we're a comcast business user?!?   UHS is a hospital management company
[10:27:25] <GJ_> Would this code be triggered by the change of #id_input? https://pastebin.com/gzgAgX2x
[10:27:44] <GJ_> source: https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/wiki/Ajax-Autocomplete
[10:28:12] <GJ_> I think its incomplete... because when I type in the field it does not run the code
[10:29:41] <taplar> there is no on change or input event handler for #id_input in that pastebin
[10:29:42] <GJ_> Pounding my head on so many examples that are not working :(
[10:30:28] <taplar> and logical changes to a variables value do not create events
[10:30:56] <GJ_> taplar: anyidea how to fix the example so it works?  Ive tried many examples and only got one too partially work.
[10:30:57] <taplar> if you want to force one, you can .trigger('change') after you change it's value
[10:31:14] <GJ_> I just need an autocomplete...
[10:31:33] <GJ_> Ive tried 5 examples...
[10:31:46] <GJ_> 6 hours
[10:32:04] <Cork> GJ_: check http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[10:32:06] <GJ_> hard to learn when your sources suck:(
[10:32:16] <Cork> it most likely have what you need
[10:32:31] <Cork> (specifically the button part)
[10:34:17] <GJ_> Cork: Ill try this code... its another bunch of changes...
[10:34:33] <taplar> welcome to development, :)
[10:34:36] <Cork> GJ_: what autocomplete are you using now?
[10:34:56] <Cork> GJ_: a better choice is prob to make a demo beside the normal project and find what works well there first
[10:35:02] <GJ_> Nothing works... I tried the link I posted to github
[10:35:02] <Cork> and THEN start trying to integrate it
[10:36:06] <GJ_> that autocomplete example does not have ajax
[10:36:16] <Cork> uh, it is built around ajax...
[10:36:37] <GJ_> <div class="ui-widget">   <label>Your preferred programming language: </label>   <select id="combobox">     <option value="">Select one...</option>     <option value="ActionScript">ActionScript</option>     <option value="AppleScript">AppleScript</option>     <option value="Asp">Asp</option>     <option value="BASIC">BASIC</option>     <option value="C">C</option>     <option value="C++">C++</option>     <option value="Clojure">Clojure</o
[10:36:42] <Cork> $().autocomplete({ source: theURL });
[10:37:11] <taplar> please don't post long blocks of html/source in the channel
[10:38:21] <GJ_> Cork, I don't see that... its got... source: $.proxy( this, "_source" )
[10:38:29] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[10:38:38] <taplar> "String: When a string is used, the Autocomplete plugin expects that string to point to a URL resource that will return JSON data. It can be on the same host or on a different one (must support CORS). The Autocomplete plugin does not filter the results, instead a query string is added with a term field, which the server-side script should use for f
[10:38:38] <taplar> iltering the results. For example, if the source option is set to "http://example.com" and the user types foo, a GET request would be made to http://example.com?term=foo. The data itself can be in the same format as the local data described above."
[10:38:59] <Cork> that plugin is VERY extendible so you can do most anything with it
[10:39:16] <Cork> i would even stick out my nose a bit and say it is the best part of jquery-ui
[10:40:07] <GJ_> taplar, can you point me to the line where this url is set in the example?
[10:40:32] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[10:40:37] <Cork> GJ_: you most likely won't get one example doing exactly what you want
[10:40:48] <Cork> you will have to take parts and build what you want
[10:40:49] <taplar> click the view source, you will see them providing the source option
[10:41:00] <GJ_> I just need help... Im new and struggling with this.
[10:41:12] <taplar> we are providing you with docs
[10:41:18] <taplar> it's up to you to experiment
[10:41:36] <taplar> if you have specific questions, feel free to ask.  but we're not going to write it for you
[10:42:08] <GJ_> taplar, its not about writing it for me... its about not getting examples that work.
[10:42:21] <taplar> so that page has working examples as it
[10:42:23] <taplar> *is
[10:42:48] <GJ_> yea.... welll they don't seem to be working examples tthat I can use...
[10:42:51] <taplar> and the API details what all the options/events do and are available
[10:43:47] <GJ_> ... and the documentation is TERRIBLE
[10:44:03] <taplar> *shrug* i disagree, but, to each his won
[10:44:07] <taplar> *own
[10:44:58] <taplar> if you can't find one that you can get to work, or that you like, why not roll up your own?
[10:50:46] <GJ_> taplar, Im just trying to get something that does the job.... most are lacking huge parts of the problem
[10:52:34] <taplar> most are generic.  it's up to you to customize them to your needs
[10:54:31] <MikeD_> autocomplete's documentation is better than anything i've ever documented  :)  (maybe that says more about our documentation than jquery)
[11:27:13] <GJ_> $("#year_input").autocomplete({ <--does this call when year_input is changed?
[11:27:32] <taplar> yes
[11:27:46] <GJ_> Its only calling it on load
[11:27:57] <taplar> any time the input value changes, the script will apply that token against the source
[11:28:44] <GJ_> yea, that never happens...
[11:28:59] <taplar> then make a fiddle demonstrating the problem
[11:33:32] <GJ_> https://jsfiddle.net/4k9vh2bj/
[11:34:00] <taplar> where's your script?
[11:34:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4k9vh2bj/1/
[11:34:41] <GJ_> included file
[11:35:16] <taplar> ok, so this is missing the jquery-ui js file
[11:36:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4k9vh2bj/2/
[11:36:24] <GJ_> one sec
[11:38:50] <GJ_> where in firebug is the javascript?
[11:38:57] <taplar> what do you mean?
[11:39:21] <GJ_> using firebug the code you enter on javascript is in some element
[11:39:46] <taplar> you can view the source of the output iframe to view that stuff
[11:39:50] <GJ_> Im just trying to watch the jsfiddle code running
[11:40:01] <GJ_> Well then its still doesn't work
[11:40:46] <poboy> doesn't google chrome have a setting where you dont' have to hit CTRL+SHIFT+R when you update your code?
[11:41:00] <taplar> poboy: there is a checkbox for disable cache
[11:41:32] <taplar> GJ_: /2 is making requests for me.  it's not valid requests since your url isn't valid for jsfiddle, but it is indeed making requests as i type
[11:41:54] <GJ_> I cant find the Javascript fiddle places in the javascript... so I can't watch it executer:(
[11:42:09] <GJ_> In some weird location...
[11:42:32] <poboy> in the network tab, I saw that.  still have to ctrl shift r.  not a huge deal
[11:42:32] <taplar> in your actual code, not jsfiddle.  Are you including jquery, then the jquery-ui js in your header?
[11:43:00] <GJ_> yes
[11:43:10] <taplar> and where are you executing that other logic?
[11:43:28] <GJ_> in an file....
[11:43:36] <GJ_> the file I originally linked
[11:43:38] <taplar> no, where are you including that file at?
[11:43:47] <taplar> after the jquery ui include?
[11:43:55] <GJ_> header, after Jquery and ui
[11:44:02] <taplar> then that's your problem
[11:44:16] <taplar> you need to either put it in a document ready or put that file include at the bottom of your page
[11:44:29] <taplar> the element you are trying to find and bind on doesn't exist at the point that the header is parsed and ran
[11:44:52] <GJ_> I don't want to include more script...
[11:44:57] <GJ_> <script>
[11:45:05] <taplar> then put it in a document ready
[11:45:24] <GJ_> whats a document ready?
[11:45:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4k9vh2bj/3/
[11:45:58] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[11:47:30] <GJ_> https://jsfiddle.net/4k9vh2bj/5/
[11:47:36] <GJ_> woops didn't see yours
[11:47:42] <taplar> which if you were doing the same kind of thing with the other plugins, trying to target elements before they exist, that would also explain why they might not have worked either.
[11:48:03] <daslicht> anyone with a Intel Graphics card see why there are such glitches :
[11:48:05] <daslicht> https://i.imgur.com/06jnwGG.png
[11:48:09] <daslicht> http://www.davidpayr.com/
[11:48:24] <taplar> wrong room daslicht
[11:48:30] <daslicht> with a nvidia graphicscard i dont get that 'tearing'
[11:48:32] <daslicht> why ?
[11:48:37] <taplar> this is a jquery room
[11:48:41] <daslicht> it is a jQuery Plugin related issue no ?
[11:48:53] <taplar> *shrug* that's not how you phrased the quesiton
[11:48:57] <daslicht> it is jquery.marquee.js related
[11:49:11] <daslicht> now you know it
[11:49:23] <daslicht> probably read first all :) before starting to attack
[11:49:28] <daslicht> :P
[11:49:31] <taplar> ok, gl man
[11:49:43] <daslicht> idea?
[11:51:07] <GJ_> taplar: that was probably my problem all the time
[11:51:32] <GJ_> Its working now, kinda... but atleast I can work on something that is beign called
[11:51:41] <taplar> :)
[11:51:55] <GJ_> What a pain in the ass, thanks taplar... I appreciate it
[11:52:00] <GJ_> Your a good guy too
[11:52:08] <taplar> sometimes, :D
[11:52:33] <GJ_> Ive met some assholes in here that I wonder why they even offer help
[11:53:02] <GJ_> well not here, the sql area
[11:53:17] <GJ_> again, I appreciate it
[11:55:18] <GJ_> taplar, can I ask you question around debugging techniques?
[11:55:43] <taplar> sure
[11:56:29] <taplar> there's a pretty good site as a tutorial for that
[11:56:30] <GJ_> Im now getting it to work, but the results are not returning what I want.  I need to get the SQL behind the json source.  If I view it in the browser directly, I can't get a submit of data...
[11:57:04] <GJ_> I need to be able to send data to the file...  Im using get
[11:57:10] <taplar> the sql behind the source?  that's more of a server debugging thing
[11:57:18] <GJ_> is that possible in firebug?
[11:57:45] <taplar> no, sql is on the server side
[11:57:51] <GJ_> Yes... but I can't view the server source cause If I type the source directly it does not show the code...
[11:58:11] <GJ_> It wont because a $_get wasn't sent
[11:58:34] <taplar> your fiddle is doing a post
[11:58:37] <taplar> that's $_POST
[11:58:41] <GJ_> Thats where Im stuck... just need to send form data to it
[11:58:54] <GJ_> ohh... ok, nm
[11:59:41] <taplar> get goes to $_GET, post to $_POST, and both of them go to $_REQUEST iirc
[12:00:32] <GJ_> WOOT, got IT!
[12:00:36] <GJ_> Thank GOD!
[12:00:37] <srg> Hi. I have a simple HTML form with a submit button at the end. What's the best/recommended way to disable the submit button so the user doesn't click it twice accidentally?
[12:00:40] <GJ_> 7 hours!
[12:00:42] <GJ_> LOL
[12:01:08] <GJ_> Good luck to you buddy!
[12:01:12] <srg> I've googled around and saw a lot of different methods, but I'm not sure what's recent/best
[12:01:13] <GJ_> taplar++
[12:01:14] <taplar> take care
[12:01:32] <GJ_> just incase karma
[12:02:15] <taplar> srg: you'd want some sort of submit handler that prevents the submit after the first time
[12:02:58] <taplar> is this a normal form submit?  not an ajax request initiated from a form submit?
[12:03:08] <srg> Yeah, normal form, user clicks the submit button
[12:03:46] <srg> I was thinking of $('#id').click(function() { $(this).attr('disabled', 'disabled'); }
[12:04:06] <taplar> well a submit can happen from hitting enter on a text field too
[12:04:13] <srg> hm
[12:04:43] <taplar> you might try this: https://jsfiddle.net/k4aa8898/
[12:05:18] <taplar> What this does is binds a submit handler to your forms, which will execute at most one time (notice the one()).
[12:05:32] <taplar> But what it does is binds another submit handler to the form that always prevents the action.
[12:05:47] <taplar> So the first time it will add that handler and continue on, cause that handler wasn't there.
[12:05:58] <taplar> But all future ones, will hit that inner handler and be prevented
[12:07:59] <srg> Thanks taplar!
[12:22:21] <coderhut> Hi experts, I am stuck in printing the individual keys from ajax returned json data. {membership_id: "110", user_id: "136055", card_type: "realtor"}. What I need to alert membership_id from this json data?
[12:23:17] <taplar_lunch> theVariable.membership_id
[12:24:12] <coderhut> taplar_lunch: thats giving undefined
[12:24:50] <taplar_lunch> console.log(typeof theVariable);
[12:27:26] <coderhut> taplar_lunch: it prints "object"
[12:27:40] <taplar_lunch> that suggests that the key is not on it
[12:27:53] <taplar_lunch> console.log(JSON.stringify(theVariable));
[12:32:33] <coderhut> taplar_lunch: sorry what I need to done after that? It prints {"membership_id":"110","user_id":"136055","card_type":"realtor"} now
[12:33:20] <taplar_lunch> can you make a fiddle showing you're issue?  cause if that's what printed then theVariable.membership_id would not be undefined
[12:33:45] <coderhut> sure
[12:36:04] <coderhut> taplar_lunch: Here is the pastiebin link https://www.pastiebin.com/5a0dcc6eacbb8
[12:38:10] <taplar_lunch> and the stringify print, prints "{"membership_id":"110","user_id":"136055","card_type":"realtor"}" verbatim?
[12:38:28] <coderhut> yes
[12:38:34] <taplar_lunch> yeah, then that should work
[12:41:48] <coderhut> I really wonder why the hell it wasn't working before pastiebin....and now it is showing :D Thanks a lot for the help!! but one question that instead of console.log(JSON.stringify(result)); will i be required to write JSON.stringify(result);
[12:42:37] <taplar_lunch> I just had you use that so we could see the string version of the object to confirm what keys it has
[12:42:42] <taplar_lunch> you don't have to use that is your code
[12:43:18] <taplar_lunch> *in
[12:43:25] <coderhut> I see....then might be cache or don't know what nonsense mistake by me was causing this issue...
[12:44:24] <coderhut> taplar_lunch: thank you a lot yet again for helping me resloving it!!
[12:44:31] <taplar_lunch> np
[13:12:45] <nopea> Is there a way to prioritize multiple functions that run from window.load?
[13:13:20] <duch_kazatel> nopea pretty sure they're queued FIFO
[13:13:28] <duch_kazatel> could have that wrong but i think that's the case.
[13:13:31] <duch_kazatel> why do you ask?
[13:13:38] <nopea> thanks - I thought that was the case.
[13:14:00] <robertmaxrees> in general the order your functions run shouldn't matter.
[13:14:20] <nopea> I have one script that runs on all pages, and one that run on certain templates, so I don't want to run them together
[13:14:32] <robertmaxrees> should use an else/if for that.
[13:15:17] <nopea> yeah that is what I will do.  Just thought it would be better to have a smaller file that is loaded all the time, and a second one only when needed.
[13:16:03] <robertmaxrees> if your stuff is getting complex i might look into something like webpack to manage all of that for you.
[13:16:11] <taplar> we put attributes on our body tag to know what initalizations should run.
[13:16:30] <nopea> I am no expert on jQuery, but when an element is not selected succesfully, does jQuery throw an error?
[13:16:36] <taplar> no
[13:16:54] <nopea> so it jsust ignores and returns false?
[13:16:56] <robertmaxrees> you get an empty jquery object back.
[13:17:09] <robertmaxrees> it returns a jquery object with 0 elements.
[13:17:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8yz92huq/
[13:18:00] <robertmaxrees> ^ no errors :)
[13:18:08] <nopea> ok - so what I could do, it put an ID on this one template, and run the function (from window.load).  Then it will only do what I want if that ID is found
[13:18:29] <robertmaxrees> why are you waiting until window load?
[13:19:17] <nopea> personal pref. but.... I like to wait till all elements are load to show the page.
[13:19:47] <nopea> https://streamworksaudio.com/ - like this... I have a loader image... then everything shows once all is loaded
[13:20:15] <robertmaxrees> nopea then use document ready.
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> window load fires way late.
[13:20:35] <robertmaxrees> those loader images are kind of a bad idea heh
[13:20:56] <nopea> robertmaxrees: yeah... I choose window.load becuz it is late, and wanted to be sure everything was loaded
[13:21:03] <robertmaxrees> erm/
[13:21:12] <robertmaxrees> that's also not when "everything" has loaded.
[13:21:20] <nopea> robertmaxrees: bad idea?  you don't like LOL ;-)
[13:22:31] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i'm working directly with google on stuff like page performance, but what would I know.
[13:24:14] <nopea> robertmaxrees: now how I supposed to know what you do?? :-)
[13:24:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd focus on fixing things like your 2 meg background image that's getting loaded via jquery./
[13:24:38] <nopea> lol
[13:24:51] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) stuff like that's a big tell
[13:25:16] <nopea> what is?
[13:25:31] <robertmaxrees> having a 2 meg background image that gets loaded via jquery.
[13:26:22] <nopea> I used a plugin for that... I didn't know it was using jQuery to do it
[13:26:39] <robertmaxrees> is mobile performance important to you?
[13:27:22] <nopea> I would like to say yes.... but 85~90% of my traffic comes from dekstop
[13:27:41] <robertmaxrees> traffic is a bad metric for that ;)
[13:27:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd look at how many people are getting referred to your page.
[13:28:05] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet your bounce rate for mobile is a little high.
[13:28:19] <robertmaxrees> because right now, on mobile, your site takes almost 4.5 seconds for the first meaningful paint. 11.5 seconds until it's interactive.
[13:28:38] <robertmaxrees> that 2 meg image takes forever to load on a mobile device.
[13:28:48] <robertmaxrees> etc etc.
[13:29:09] <nopea> 60% for Oct.
[13:29:27] <taplar> the notion being that you shouldn't not consider mobile due to your low usage, but you should consider it because your usage may be low due to it
[13:29:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[13:29:43] <nopea> glass half full ;)
[13:29:45] <robertmaxrees> more and more traffic is shifting to mobile.
[13:29:50] <nopea> or half empty
[13:30:13] <robertmaxrees> your page takes so long to load that users are seeing it, saying "nope", and then bouncing.
[13:30:24] <taplar> more like basing decisions off of a potential effect, rather than looking at the potential causal
[13:30:26] <robertmaxrees> users on phones are impatient.
[13:30:32] <nopea> my theory is because our products specialize on video tutorials covering desktop applications
[13:31:00] <robertmaxrees> nopea that's a little misguided.
[13:31:00] <nopea> and they are on their desktop while looking for tutorials covering these applications
[13:31:02] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[13:31:22] <robertmaxrees> your seo/marketing is likely getting mobile users, as well.
[13:31:36] <robertmaxrees> if you can get them to engage, you get more potential conversions,.
[13:32:47] <nopea> 30% of referrals are on mobile
[13:32:57] <robertmaxrees> so almost 1/3rd
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> that'
[13:33:06] <robertmaxrees> *that's a decent chunk of change.
[13:33:18] <nopea> 50% of that 30% come from our emails.
[13:33:24] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:34:24] <robertmaxrees> the nice thing is you have a bunch of low-hanging fruit that you can fix and then leave alone and increase conversion rates./
[13:39:43] <nopea> robertmaxrees: so you are saying that Google does not like pages that have a 'loader'?
[13:40:06] <robertmaxrees> basically.  you're making the issue.
[13:40:09] <robertmaxrees> *masking
[13:40:23] <nopea> How I have it implemanted now is that I have a div that covers the entire page, then when document.ready (or window.load) the cover gets removed
[13:40:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the issue is your pageload itself is taking so long.  you shouldn't need that in the first place.
[13:41:07] <nopea> I am wondering from an HTML point of view, what Google would see that would get negative marks
[13:41:23] <robertmaxrees> oddly enough
[13:41:30] <robertmaxrees> google actually runs your whole page like a person one.
[13:41:37] <robertmaxrees> *would
[13:41:49] <robertmaxrees> like, they execute javascript and render the page and all that jazz.
[13:42:13] <nopea> I was under the impression they just scan (the bots) the HTML itself
[13:42:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:42:19] <robertmaxrees> not any more.
[13:42:25] <robertmaxrees> hasn't been that way for a while.
[13:42:25] <nopea> interesting
[13:43:01] <nopea> mmm - maybe I should think about removing it then
[13:43:02] <robertmaxrees> it's part of how they drop rank for sites that, say, pop a modal up on pageload asking for email.
[13:43:58] <nopea> so I am guessing the less jQuery the better
[13:44:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:44:09] <robertmaxrees> wrong way to think about it :)
[13:44:31] <robertmaxrees> most of your issues are centered around load times.
[13:45:27] <nopea> I get that.  Sometimes I wonder though if we are sacrificing design ideas for load time to please Google (and not how we want the site to look)
[13:46:10] <nopea> but if that is what you have to do to compete... ;-)
[13:47:16] <nopea> robertmaxrees: how were you able to see that that BG image was loaded by jQuery?
[13:54:09] <robertmaxrees> my suggestions have nothing to do with your user score and everything to do with pleasing endusers.
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/dYV1CNF.png see where is says "initiator"?
[13:56:29] <nopea> doh - of course
[14:00:05] * taplar has been popcorn bombed
[14:05:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:06:18] <taplar> microwave over the wall from me.  someone made some popcorn.  really want some now
[14:07:04] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:07:11] <robertmaxrees> the worst feeling imo
[14:38:48] <poboy> ok, this must be piss-poor syntax because every table row I click on shows 0;     let index = $("#processLettersTbl tbody tr").index();
[14:39:06] <taplar> heh
[14:39:13] <taplar> which tr are you getting the index for?
[14:40:05] <poboy> I want index to equal whichever row I click on
[14:40:17] <taplar> ok, how would that lookup do that?
[14:40:28] <poboy> idk, i'm trying to figure it out
[14:40:39] <poboy> i tried index.val() and that was not correct
[14:40:40] <taplar> is the 'this' the tr you clicked on?
[14:41:08] <taplar> try .index(this)
[14:42:01] <poboy> hmm, that shows -1
[14:42:13] <taplar> so 'this' is not the tr
[14:42:26] <taplar> 'a' tr in that table
[14:42:57] <taplar> you need a reference to an element that is a tr in that collection for that to work
[14:43:06] <poboy> ok thanks
[15:44:29] <poboy> any reason why $('#deleteRow').click(function () {        doesn't work but         $(document).on('click', '#deleteRow', function () {     does?
[15:45:26] <taplar> when you bind on an element, they have to exist
[15:45:57] <taplar> delegate bindings, the later example, bind on existing parents and react to events from children that will exist and some point in the future
[15:46:11] <poboy> ah, thanks!
[18:49:50] <gambl0re> hi taplar
[18:50:24] <gambl0re> do you remember what you said to robert?
[18:53:48] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re i see what he said in the logs.  it was a joke.
[18:53:49] <robertmaxrees> let it go.
[18:53:50] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[19:01:31] <madprops> hey
[19:02:19] <madprops> i'm having a problem and im not sure if it's a bug or something im doing wrong
[19:02:20] <madprops> https://jsfiddle.net/L6poures/
[19:02:43] <madprops> Basically, if I clone an element with .clone(true, true), after I replace the container with .html and appended again, and repeat that process again, the click event is gone.
[19:07:00] <robertmaxrees> madprops any reason you're not just using a delegated handler instead?
[19:12:40] <madprops> robertmaxrees, im using one for a simple event. but now im passing a function(){..} to the function that creates the element. I'd have to somehow pass the function to .data or something which i don't think it's very flexible since it's stored in the html data- attributes i think
[19:12:54] <madprops> plus too much cohesion with jquery if it uses its own data implementation
[19:14:02] <madprops> if i can store whole functions in .data i could consider that
[19:14:10] <madprops> but it would be nice if the clone events just worked
[19:16:42] <robertmaxrees> they do work, but they're a hacky solution.
[19:17:37] <madprops> yeah i wont do that
[19:17:53] <madprops> i still have no idea
[19:18:03] <madprops> .. how the events get removed
[19:18:26] <madprops> what i do is replace the container with .html() then .append(someArrayWithJqueryElements)
[19:18:47] <madprops> somehow when i do that again the events are gone
[19:19:02] <madprops> i don't know why the array would get modified
[19:19:03] <robertmaxrees> pretty straightforward.
[19:19:08] <robertmaxrees> you're breaking the rteference.
[19:19:09] <madprops> i also tried array.slice(0)
[19:19:29] <robertmaxrees> jqeury objects aren't arrays fwiw.
[19:19:53] <madprops> im putting them inside an array
[19:19:55] <madprops> []
[19:19:59] <robertmaxrees> why?
[19:20:06] <madprops> to store them, to use them later
[19:20:18] <robertmaxrees> why not just store them in a jquery object?
[19:20:28] <madprops> yeah, with .add and stuff
[19:20:32] <madprops> im gonna try that
[19:21:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L6poures/4/
[19:21:03] <robertmaxrees> btw
[19:21:12] <madprops> although it kidna complicated things..
[19:21:30] <robertmaxrees> madprops are you generating a lot of things using $()?
[19:21:33] <robertmaxrees> like a lot of markup?
[19:21:50] <madprops> lots of small ones
[19:22:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, jquery quickly falls apart when you start doing that.
[19:22:07] <robertmaxrees> it's not really meant to handle templating.
[19:23:27] <madprops> what did you do in that fiddle?
[19:23:32] <madprops> i see you clone twice
[19:23:52] <robertmaxrees> compare it against yours.
[19:23:55] <robertmaxrees> see the differences?
[19:24:48] <madprops> you clone the same item when adding/removing
[19:25:00] <robertmaxrees> i also flipped the order of some things.
[19:25:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L6poures/5/ to reduce some complexity.
[19:26:59] <madprops> thing is
[19:27:09] <madprops> you have that item as global ... im storing them in an array
[19:27:18] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[19:27:26] <GJ_> ok, I have a change I made... And I want to access the new variables.  Where would I look? https://pastebin.com/mek5knMy
[19:27:38] <robertmaxrees> madprops objects are objectsd.
[19:27:53] <robertmaxrees> madprops https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L6poures/6/
[19:28:12] <GJ_> Im receiving the data with a php function.  I use to _POST['term'] but now???
[19:28:29] <robertmaxrees> GJ_ you put your code that relies on the data within the success callback.
[19:28:35] <robertmaxrees> data is the object.
[19:28:40] <robertmaxrees> that came back from the server.
[19:28:45] <madprops> any way to clone all of them instead of a single one?
[19:28:48] <madprops> apart from looping
[19:29:05] <robertmaxrees> you mean using a for loop or...?
[19:29:18] <madprops> something efficient
[19:29:29] <madprops> since i append all items
[19:29:31] <madprops> not just a single one
[19:29:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:30:01] <GJ_> robertmaxrees: success?  Its my source call back.  Didn't think that was the success
[19:30:10] <robertmaxrees> GJ_ huh?
[19:30:12] <GJ_> how can I send more then one term then?
[19:30:26] <robertmaxrees> GJ_  i guess i'm confused about the question
[19:30:30] <robertmaxrees> madprops if microoptimizations are a concern, then you definitely don't want to use an array of jquery objects.
[19:30:40] <robertmaxrees> that memory overhead is going to be kind of high.
[19:31:12] <GJ_> robertmaxrees: I want the autocomplete to send the values to my server of three values.
[19:31:44] <robertmaxrees> year make and model?
[19:31:48] <robertmaxrees> you're sending them :)
[19:31:49] <GJ_> Yes
[19:32:04] <GJ_> Thats what I want...
[19:32:06] <robertmaxrees> are you asking how to access that in php?
[19:32:12] <GJ_> yes...
[19:32:22] <GJ_> is it in an array...
[19:32:24] <robertmaxrees> that wasn't clear in your original question.
[19:32:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:32:36] <GJ_> robertmaxrees: no problem, thanks for the help :)
[19:32:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm not familiar with how PHP handles post objects.
[19:32:48] <GJ_> $_POST
[19:32:49] <robertmaxrees> i might ask in the php channel.
[19:32:59] <GJ_> Im just confused on what type of object is this
[19:33:14] <robertmaxrees> no clue.  dunno how php handles that kind of stuff :)
[19:33:26] <GJ_> its hard for me to goto php cause I don't know what data is... is it an array, object, collection?
[19:33:46] <robertmaxrees> the channel ##php should be able to tell you.
[19:33:50] <GJ_> I would say it was a variable...
[19:33:58] <GJ_> Im talking about data in the code I sent
[19:34:02] <GJ_> jquery
[19:34:07] <robertmaxrees> that's an object.
[19:34:18] <GJ_> the "data:" is...
[19:34:21] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[19:34:28] <GJ_> array?
[19:34:36] <GJ_> <-- Noob
[19:34:37] <robertmaxrees> an object.
[19:34:43] <GJ_> ok
[19:34:45] <robertmaxrees> not an array.
[19:34:46] <GJ_> thank you
[19:34:53] <robertmaxrees> but js and php treat those things differently.
[19:34:58] <GJ_> yep
[19:35:09] <GJ_> Ill ask php, but now I can talk smart like
[19:35:29] <robertmaxrees> technically, data is a property whose value is an object.
[19:35:31] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[19:40:08] <madprops> i dont understand why this is a reference problem .. i thought the clone objects would be self contained
[19:46:21] <robertmaxrees> because .append() moves the original object.
[19:46:26] <GJ_> robertmaxrees: they are telling me I need to come here... they cant help me cause its a Jscript issue:(
[19:46:33] <robertmaxrees> GJ_ *javascript
[19:46:36] <robertmaxrees> and what's the issue?
[19:46:45] <robertmaxrees> don't you need to access the post body on the php side?
[19:46:46] <GJ_> look up
[19:47:04] <GJ_> need to know how javascript serializes objects
[19:47:09] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:47:22] <robertmaxrees> wat lol
[19:47:30] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to post json to php?
[19:47:32] <GJ_> robertmaxrees: what they told me...
[19:47:41] <GJ_> Nope... just that code
[19:47:51] <robertmaxrees> heh.

[19:48:31] <GJ_> Everyone pointing to everyone else
[19:48:40] <madprops> robertmaxrees, some sort of alternative for append?
[19:49:00] <robertmaxrees> madprops do what i showed you - clone the original object and then append that clone.
[19:49:05] <robertmaxrees> instead of cloning once.
[19:49:14] <madprops> hm
[19:49:25] <madprops> thing is, i'd have to clone the whole array
[19:49:36] <madprops> wait let me try something
[19:49:46] <robertmaxrees> this is why jquery is terrible as a templating engine.
[19:49:48] <robertmaxrees> GJ_ http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[19:50:01] <robertmaxrees> under the options, it has a definition for "data"
[19:53:48] <madprops> robertmaxrees, i ended up making a for loop and appending each element cloned. I know it's probably terrible, but i think the browser can handle it
[19:55:41] <madprops> thanks
[19:58:28] <GJ_> robertmaxrees: again, you... helpfull.... them... not so much:)(
[19:58:40] <GJ_> robertmaxrees: again, you... helpfull.... them... not so much:)
[19:59:33] <robertmaxrees> madprops foreach
[19:59:36] <robertmaxrees> never use for loops.
[20:00:39] <madprops> robertmaxrees, even if i use for of ?
[20:00:52] <robertmaxrees> for of on arrays is even worse.
[20:01:04] <robertmaxrees> imo.
[20:01:36] <robertmaxrees> that's prescriptive instead of descriptive - you're telling the language how to do something instead of describing the result you want.
[20:02:06] <robertmaxrees> err, for loops are bad, for in are worse imo.  for of is like for in, if a little less bad.
[20:02:43] <madprops> so it's a conceptual thing, not an optimization issue?
[20:03:02] <robertmaxrees> aye, which is ultimately what you should be concerned with iunitially.
[20:03:07] <robertmaxrees> *initially
[20:03:36] <GJ_> whats wrong with for each?
[20:03:56] <robertmaxrees> GJ_ you mean .forEach() or...?
[20:04:05] <robertmaxrees> madprops premature optimization is a killer.  also: if you're concerned about optimizing anything, your first big wins would be 1: not using jquery as a templating engine and 2: not using an array to store a bunch of jquery objects.
[20:04:17] <GJ_> I mean, foreach in general... I thought you where talking methodology
[20:04:29] <robertmaxrees> i am talking methodology.
[20:04:29] <GJ_> ... not tools
[20:04:45] <GJ_> Ok, so... can you respond why you don't like it?
[20:04:53] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[20:04:55] <GJ_> Just curious
[20:04:56] <GJ_> Foreach
[20:04:59] <GJ_> lol
[20:05:02] <robertmaxrees> i do like array.forEach()
[20:05:11] <robertmaxrees> for, for in, and for of are weird.
[20:05:20] <GJ_> Ahh,
[20:05:28] <robertmaxrees> for in can also introduce subtle, weird bugs.
[20:05:56] <GJ_> Im relearning Javascript.
[20:06:02] <robertmaxrees> for (var i=0 blah blah for working with arrays is weird because you want to do something with an array, not count.
[20:06:32] <GJ_> true... unless your doing something else AND counting
[20:06:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:06:46] <robertmaxrees> why are you counting?
[20:06:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:07:04] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 you don't even actually want to enumerate anyway.
[20:07:34] <GJ_> Well, counting changes for instance... for each (...) if ($something) {do something... $OurCountOfDoingSomething}
[20:07:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:08:00] <robertmaxrees> you mean forEach(function() { if (somePredicate) ?});
[20:08:08] <robertmaxrees> ignore that ?
[20:08:20] <GJ_> Yes, sorry I was using sudo code
[20:08:35] <robertmaxrees> looks like you want to .filter() first.
[20:08:48] <GJ_> lol
[20:09:03] <GJ_> Maybe... that is a good point

[20:11:03] <GJ_> Jscript is so weird
[20:11:13] <GJ_> I like, but its weird
[20:11:43] <GJ_> I use to know it....
[20:12:01] <GJ_> Very well... Thought Id remember it
[20:13:57] <madprops> javascript slowly became my favorite language
[20:18:31] <robertmaxrees> *javascript\
[20:18:37] <robertmaxrees> nobody calls it "jscript" :)
[20:20:09] <robertmaxrees> GJ_ that fiddle uses a few relatively recent additions to the language.

[21:50:49] <pokmo> hi
[21:51:11] <pokmo> if i have foo.bar = function(a) {}; is foo.bar a constructor?
[22:15:23] <shoky_> any function can be a constructor
[22:58:54] <phptojscript> I want to return from php to jQuery $.ajax() a object how can i fix this ?
