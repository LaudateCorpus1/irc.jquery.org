[08:26:21] <mistnim> hi, in what situations could $el.find(...) return a normal Array?
[17:55:58] <Absolum> Could someone tell me why I can't get the .extendable parent of a button on click? https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/QWGZxGJ?editors=1111
[17:56:58] <robertmaxrees> Absolum that markup isn't valid, for starts.
[17:57:02] <robertmaxrees> *starters
[17:58:04] <robertmaxrees> secondly 'field.extendable' is trying to select <field class="extendable">, which i'm guessing you don't want :)
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> if you want to select an element with both classes, then you'll want '.field.extendable' :)
[17:59:13] <Absolum> The topmost field div is extendable. It gets the extend class when the extended panel shows. extendable is the class that toggles extend. I know i need better classnames.
[17:59:46] <Absolum> What's weird is it works to expand the panel, but not to contract it
[18:00:53] <Absolum> now it finds it but doesn't toggle the class.
[18:06:47] <Absolum> still the same problem. It's like .closest isn't finding the granparent
[18:09:37] <Absolum> Maybe I'll just use the details element.
[18:34:41] <robertmaxrees> Absolum mind updating the codepen and sticking valid markup in it?
