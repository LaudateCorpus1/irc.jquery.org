[00:50:35] <cluelessperson> Does someone know of a good jquery word cloud?
[00:50:59] <cluelessperson> jquery word cloud library, I mean, with multiple nodes?   Or a jquery node based ui?
[02:36:26] <iaj_> Hey guys!
[02:36:46] <iaj_> When I wanted a cross-allbrowser way to have a javascript attach an href to an #foo, what would be the wisest way
[02:49:47] <Cork> iaj_: attache a href to a what?
[03:43:52] <ClydeSlims> is there a way to fade in a span of text from the left? As in, each character from left-right would gradually get faded in
[03:44:56] <arc_> with something like this, sure https://github.com/ChrisCates/TextfxAPI
[03:46:28] <aditsu_> ClydeSlims: I'm thinking alpha gradient on top
[04:01:19] <ClydeSlims> aditsu: alpha on top? what?
[04:28:59] <Cork> ClydeSlims: you can put an after element with a background gradient from white to rgba(255, 255, 255, 1) <-- alpha gradient
[04:29:11] <Cork> and have it cover the text as it expands the element
[04:42:00] <Cork> ClydeSlims: https://jsfiddle.net/boLquaa6/2/
[04:44:26] <ClydeSlims> Cork: why position-absolute? or is it relative to the span's location?
[04:44:38] <Cork> ClydeSlims: ya
[04:44:44] <Cork> it is the gradient at the end of the span
[04:44:46] <ClydeSlims> Cork: also, shouldn't it be ::after ?
[04:44:54] <Cork> ClydeSlims: they are the same
[04:45:02] <Cork> :after is the old syntax for the same thing
[04:45:10] <Cork> (so why waist the extra character)
[04:45:31] <ClydeSlims> huh ZI didnt know you could animate like that with css
[04:45:33] <ClydeSlims> thank you
[04:45:56] <Cork> ClydeSlims: note there is one fairly big limitation
[04:46:02] <Cork> it requires white-space: nowrap
[04:46:13] <Cork> so the lines can't be longer then the screen width
[04:46:46] <ClydeSlims> what if the line is never longer than the screen width?
[04:47:06] <Cork> then it isn't a problem
[04:47:15] <Cork> cause then the text doesn't need to wrap to fit
[04:47:38] <ClydeSlims> oh ok
[04:49:05] <Cork> ClydeSlims: depending on the use situation you might want to change from vw to %
[04:49:27] <ClydeSlims> Cork: I usually use %.
[04:49:44] <Cork> depends on what you need it for :)
[04:53:29] <ClydeSlims> hmm doesnt work for me
[04:53:30] <ClydeSlims> https://jsfiddle.net/da0hkhu0/
[04:53:34] <ClydeSlims> when I apply it to my code
[04:54:29] <ClydeSlims> oh shoot
[04:54:50] <ClydeSlims> I guess its looking for an h6 within an h2
[04:55:25] <arc_> i don't like how that looks compared to fading in individual characters
[04:58:06] <aditsu_> ClydeSlims: something with an alpha gradient, on top of your text (on the z axis)
[04:59:23] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/ytch7rmn/ this one is probably a lot worse than Cork's css version
[05:08:53] <yabbah> Isn't removeAttr('value') working in IE ? What shall I do to empty a value then?
[05:09:04] <Cork> yabbah: .val('')
[05:09:22] <Cork> you should never try to modify state with .attr or removeAttr
[05:09:57] <Cork> alternatively you can use .prop('value', '')
[05:10:05] <Cork> but .val('') is a shortcut for that so...
[05:11:41] <yabbah> Cork: Okey, i tried fritext.val(''); .. where fritext = row.find('.fritext').val(); But dont work either. Say its not a supported by object.
[05:11:49] <yabbah> So its surely some issue with my code .. hehe
[05:11:55] <yabbah> wierd it work in chrome tho
[05:12:08] <Cork> yabbah: sounds like you're not using jquery
[05:12:25] <Cork> oh
[05:12:26] <Cork> wait
[05:12:27] <Uhkis> yabbah: remove the val() from the fritext =
[05:12:35] <Cork> you can't call .val() on the result from .val()
[05:15:14] <yabbah> I have a placeholder on the "fritext" input, and if the user not change the text its default save the placeholder. So I wanted to empty it if thats the case. Any idea how to fix it?
[05:15:50] <Cork> yabbah: why not just use <input placeholder="the text"> ?
[05:17:21] <yabbah> Cork: I use that, <textarea input placeholder="Fritext (frivilligt), max 500 tecken" class="fritext" noresize maxlength="500"></textarea>
[05:17:59] <yabbah> But it still store "Fritext (frivilligt), max 500 tecken" if I dont change it and just input the other fields in the form. Fritext is optional.
[05:19:45] <yabbah> Thats why I tried to use: if (fritext === 'Fritext (frivilligt), max 500 tecken') {
[05:19:48] <yabbah>  			fritext.val('');
[05:19:51] <yabbah>  		}
[05:19:52] <yabbah> in the script.js
[05:20:14] <yabbah> And that work as a charm in chrome, but not in IE.
[05:20:24] <Viddax> var tr = $(this).closest('tr');
[05:20:24] <Viddax> console.log(tr.data('entry-id'));
[05:20:25] <Cork> yabbah: not sure what you mean https://jsfiddle.net/hbc3o1qp/
[05:20:31] <Viddax> Why I am not getting entry-id ?
[05:20:35] <Cork> works fine (and should work for you too)
[05:21:02] <Cork> Viddax: does the element have an data-entry-id attribute?
[05:21:05] <Cork> oh
[05:21:08] <Viddax> yes
[05:21:12] <Cork> btw i think .data stores it as entryId
[05:21:29] <Viddax> in <tr data-entry-id="xxx">
[05:21:32] <Cork> (to follow the dom naming standard)
[05:22:43] <Cork> Viddax: https://jsfiddle.net/u033d65e/
[05:23:26] <Viddax> Ahh I see
[05:23:27] <yabbah> Cork: My english isnt so good. So you maybe missunderstand me. I try again. I have a form with some fields and a textarea which is optional named 'fritext'. When user press 'Save'-button it save the inputs in a database. But if they have not enter anything in 'fritext', the default placeholder-text will be inserted in the database. And I want to have it as if the placeholder-text is in the variable for 'fritext', it should insert an empty string in the 
[05:23:30] <Viddax> Why entryId
[05:24:27] <Cork> yabbah: ya, that is what i said, but that only happens if you put the value in the textarea instead of as a placeholder
[05:24:44] <Cork> Viddax: i answered that 6 lines up
[05:25:16] <yabbah> Cork: But as you saw in my code, I use it as placeholder. But it still store it in the database.
[05:25:38] <Cork> yabbah: then you have to figure out why it gets copied from placeholder to the value of the field
[05:25:44] <Cork> cause that isn't normal behavior
[05:25:51] <Cork> (like my paste showed)
[05:26:23] <Cork> uh... paste....
[05:26:25] <Cork> i meant jsfiddle
[05:27:00] <yabbah> Cork: It just happens in IE, not chrome/firefox.
[05:27:20] <Cork> ugg, give me a bit so i can boot a vm
[05:28:34] <Uhkis> yabbah: you want something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/hbc3o1qp/1/
[05:29:11] <Cork> Uhkis: that is the oposit of what he wants
[05:29:43] <Cork> bleh... my vm is broken...
[05:30:01] <Uhkis> "But if they have not enter anything in 'fritext', the default placeholder-text will be inserted in the database"
[05:30:05] <JosefDe> Hi guys. How can I achieve this?: I'm generating file-output in PHP via "readfile()". Now I want to download that file via Ajax and not via redirect in PHP
[05:30:07] <JosefDe> How can I do that?
[05:30:58] <Cork> Uhkis: ya, as in he gets the placeholder pushed to the server
[05:31:07] <Cork> and he wants to get nothing
[05:33:10] <Cork> there we go
[05:33:17] <yabbah> Cork / Uhkis, figured out. My brain was asleep .. just used fritext = ''; ;)
[05:35:39] <JosefDe> Has anyone an idea?
[05:36:05] <Cork> yabbah: i just tested on ie, and it does the same thing
[05:36:14] <Cork> yabbah: so you have something else bugging out for you
[05:36:42] <Cork> JosefDe: you can't really download files with ajax
[05:36:59] <Cork> JosefDe: you theoretically can use data blob and then convert that to a link
[05:37:08] <Cork> but i wouldn't recommend it
[05:59:18] <Duikb00t> What way are you guys using inview? Are you using a plugin for lets' say animating some numbers when the appear in the viewport?
[06:35:17] <Chublul> What is the support channel for JsDatatables
[06:35:25] <Chublul> Let me ask my query here.
[06:36:16] <Chublul> I have searched something on datatable, now it has some state on page, now i wan to reload the datables after clearing the state and load the data which was rendrered on its first initialization.
[06:36:59] <Chublul> table.state.clear();table.ajax.reload(); and its not working with latest datatable.js
[06:37:22] <Chublul> Its loading content with same state,
[06:37:38] <Chublul> Or do you recommed clearing the search box with jquery and than reload it.
[06:37:43] <Chublul> Does it make sense
[06:37:52] <Chublul> But there must be some dt way
[06:57:26] <j6mes> trying to make a 'pure' app. just makes you realise how much you depend on things like jquery and angular D:
[07:00:45] <Cork> it does?
[07:02:43] <j6mes> well. i miss all the syntactic sugar
[07:02:51] <j6mes> but its actually quite a refreshing experiencve

[07:44:46] <arnas> CSS animations*
[07:46:05] <jquery138> arnas, just add class, then css that class

[07:58:54] <spliffy> Hi! i modified the jquery ui autocomplete combobox sample. In it i want to call hasAttributes on the decorated select element. (https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox) Inside the plugin code the decorated select is assigned to this.element. When i call hasAttributes() on it i get the error 'hasAttributes is not a function'.
[07:59:59] <spliffy> As a workaround i call document.getElementById(this.element.attr('id')).hasAttributes(). Why can't i call it on this.element? Apparently it has lost its type information.
[08:00:52] <Cork> spliffy: cause this.element is a jquery collection not a raw dom element
[08:01:29] <Cork> spliffy: you can just use this.element.is('[attr]') if you like
[08:03:21] <mikatone> hi is there a way i can toogle a few classes in element? Basicly I want o change <i class="fa fa-send"></i> to <i class="fa fa-spinner fa-fw"></i>  ?
[08:03:57] <Cork> mikatone: .toggleClass('fa-send faspinner fa-fw') should work
[08:04:19] <Cork> though i would prob recommend just using .addClass().removeClass() as it becomes clearer what you intend should happen
[08:04:30] <mikatone> I gueI thougth it would have to be an array passed... [classes...] ;)
[08:08:23] <mikatone> thanks Corks, I guess that toogleClass it makes more sense when you whant to play with one class...
[08:09:03] <mikatone> sorry man this keyboard is just fuc*ed up as much as i am supose :D
[08:23:52] <Cork> mikeiniowa: normally it is cleaner to use one class and toggle by having it on or off
[08:24:08] <spliffy> Cork:  thank you. Can you explain how it works? What is the '[attr]' string? The documentation of the is method says it is a selector expression, but what exactly does it select?
[08:24:13] <Cork> mikeiniowa: but ya awesomefont makes that a bit hard
[08:24:32] <Cork> spliffy: the attribute name
[08:24:38] <Duikb00t> Straight forward jquery code, but why I am I only able to run it once? http://kopy.io/R38bv ( I can toggle to open and toggle to close but thats it )
[08:24:41] <Cork> same as $('[href]') for example
[08:25:02] <Duikb00t> Nvm fixed it
[08:25:33] <Cork> Duikb00t: why do you keep using strings for a boolean state?
[08:25:51] <Duikb00t> You mean this line? var final_state = $(this).is(':hidden') ? 'hidden' : 'visible';
[08:25:51] <Cork> just do var final_state = $(this).is(':hidden');
[08:26:10] <Cork> * just do var final_state_visible = !$(this).is(':hidden');
[08:26:10] <spliffy> Cork: ok, is see. great
[08:26:20] <Cork> and if(final_state_visible) {} else {}
[08:26:42] <Duikb00t> http://kopy.io/umrrZ
[08:27:48] <Duikb00t> Ok won't do it anymore Cork
[08:28:28] <Cork> Duikb00t: just do https://jsfiddle.net/e7rnbhn4/
[08:28:44] <Cork> in css you can do .active and :not(.active) if you need to separate them
[08:28:55] <Cork> (or just a default and one with .active)
[08:30:11] <spliffy> Cork: so this.element is a collection. What does it contain though? Only attributes?
[08:30:25] <Cork> spliffy: its a collection same as you would get from $()
[08:30:36] <Cork> so it is a collection of dom elements
[08:30:53] <Cork> or specifically it is an instance of jquery wrapping an array of elements
[08:31:14] <Cork> spliffy: so this.element[0] == dom element
[08:32:33] <Duikb00t> oh :D
[08:32:36] <Duikb00t> dammit
[08:32:46] <Duikb00t> #intro-cols > h3.active:before {  was doing this kind of things
[08:39:03] <spliffy> Cork: so this.element[0] should be the same as what i get by docuement.getElementById(this.element.attr('id')). Is this correct?
[08:39:12] <Cork> yes
[08:40:14] <JosefDe> Hi guys. How can I add my custom HTML to the Bottom of the zoom-window of the jQuery-coconut-plugin?
[08:40:24] <JosefDe> I mean Chocolat
[08:45:29] <jak2000> how to count lines while type data on a textarea? (i am interested in count lines or count ENTERS).
[08:51:37] <ClydeSlims2> jak2000, couldn't you do... lines = text.split( "\r" ).length; ?
[08:51:41] <Cork> jak2000: the etirnal problem
[08:51:46] <Cork> ClydeSlims2: no not \r
[08:52:01] <Cork> jak2000: you can split on '\n' and count the hard line breaks
[08:52:19] <ClydeSlims2> ah so that same code except replaced with  '\n' then?
[08:52:21] <Cork> but you might have soft linebreaks (text wrap) and there isn't really any way to count those
[08:52:34] <Cork> ClydeSlims2: yes, and no :)
[08:53:05] <Cork> jak2000: so how far you need to go into this rabbit hole depends on how precise you need to be
[08:54:03] <ClydeSlims2> jak2000, found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2035910/how-to-get-the-number-of-lines-in-a-textarea
[08:55:01] <Cork> ClydeSlims2: those are all fairly quick hacks that all fail on the example i mentioned
[08:55:31] <ClydeSlims2> Cork: Mm I think one or two of the answers seem to stray away from using '\r' and '\n'
[08:55:44] <JosefDe> Does anyone like Chocolat?
[08:56:00] <Cork> ClydeSlims2: but none of them does a correct calculation
[08:56:06] <ClydeSlims2> Cork: ah.
[08:56:16] <Cork> cause that is hard and fairly costly
[08:56:22] <ClydeSlims2> I suppose there isn't really a precise way to get an exact amount.
[08:56:34] <ClydeSlims2> Since it depends on so many factors right?
[08:57:19] <Cork> there is
[08:57:31] <Cork> what you have to do is copy the text into a new element with specific proportion
[08:57:47] <Cork> where you console font size and line-height to map correctly for your needs
[08:58:01] <ClydeSlims2> Oh I see.
[08:58:05] <Cork> then set the width of the element to match the width of the textarea
[08:58:14] <Cork> and then calculate the height of that element
[08:58:26] <Cork> and from there figure out the number of lines
[08:58:37] <Cork> its a messy solution, but the only "true" solution
[08:58:42] <ClydeSlims2> yeah definitely messy
[08:58:53] <Cork> every other solution base it on "close enough"
[08:59:09] <Cork> but will fail fairly badly in some cases
[08:59:41] <Cork> this is an OLD problem that's been around since the 90's :)
[08:59:58] <Cork> sadly enough a solution haven't been implemented in the dom...
[09:00:12] <ClydeSlims2> oh wow didn't realize it was such a problem. I can't even think of what use I'd have of counting lines from a textarea.
[09:00:24] <ClydeSlims2> for my projects anyways
[09:01:12] <ClydeSlims2> was thinking of using one for a little chat project but then I figured it might be better to just use separate elements for each message in the chat
[09:03:32] <Cork> ya, number of lines doesn't make much sense as it is dependent of font size and screen size
[09:03:40] <Cork> and if the user resizes the textarea or not
[09:03:48] <Cork> and that makes it kinda pointless
[09:30:56] <jak2013> Cork thanks for answer.....
[09:31:46] <jak2013> ClydeSlims2, Cork a question: can i put this code: lines = text.split( "\n" ).length;  can i put onkeyup event?
[09:34:01] <yabbah> I have jQuery to add a css-class if the input is incorrect. Is there a way to make a tooltip or something too? Both red border (css) and a tooltip or any other information-thing? :)
[09:34:37] <yabbah> input in a text input-field
[09:39:40] <taplar> someone was talking earlier about IE passing the placeholder back to the server on submit instead of blank?
[09:40:14] * taplar was scanning the logs
[09:41:00] <taplar> idk about newer versions, but older versions would definitely do that
[09:41:03] <jazzonmym11nd> how can i match all images that have an attribute following the pattern "data-Xx" where capital X is a number?
[09:54:43] <mikatone> whats the best way to detach click event during function execution?
[09:55:11] <taplar> direct bind or delegate bind?
[09:55:41] <mikatone> daplar nice one, i have no ideia what the difference?
[09:56:13] <taplar> on('click', function) vs on('click', 'selector', function)
[09:56:46] <taplar> the second is used on a parent of the element
[09:56:56] <mikatone> taplar i guess it is direct bind
[09:57:19] <taplar> in that case you can name your handler and then use off('click', fnName)
[09:57:24] <mikatone> is there any advantage in delegate bind?
[09:57:31] <taplar> lots
[09:57:46] <mikatone> main differences?
[09:57:55] <taplar> since your placing the binding on the parent, children can be created/deleted now/future and it does not matter
[09:58:02] <taplar> and it's a single binding
[09:58:48] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[10:17:48] <mikatone> taplar in this caseso in this case
[10:18:33] <mikatone> KVirc is completly bugged
[10:18:36] <mikatone> http://jsbin.com/pofaluyulo/edit?html,js,console,output
[10:19:13] <mikatone> taplar can you takle this example and plug off function
[10:20:10] <taplar> actually, for that case just change it from on() to one()
[10:20:57] <mikatone> taplar and thank you for the hadler literature it's defenetly a complex topic...
[10:21:03] <taplar> :)
[10:21:25] <taplar> one() is like on() except it removes the handler after the first time
[10:21:43] <mikatone> one() it says its not a function strange...
[10:22:15] <mikatone> it wroks now refreshed
[10:22:23] <mikatone> ;)
[10:22:28] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/one/
[10:24:07] <mikatone> it was introduced in which version?
[10:26:31] <taplar> the docs show that on the rhs of the top parts
[10:26:38] <taplar> 1.1, 1.7, etc
[10:27:20] <mikatone> taplar in resume the one detach the event handler during function execution and attach after function return?
[10:28:08] <taplar> you could do that, sure
[10:28:47] <taplar> personally though i might choose to use delegate for that instead
[10:29:09] <mikatone> taplar get me an example pleeeease :)
[10:29:14] <taplar> then you could add/remove/change classes to make it work for one delegate at the start, and then the other later
[10:29:21] <taplar> one sec
[10:30:20] <mikatone> nice I've read a bit about deferreds promises and so but too advanced topic for me at the time got to go slowly :)

[10:43:43] <mikatone> taplar what if I want to prevent click event from fire function
[10:44:15] <VarunAgw> Is there JS/jQuery inbuilt way to prettify it
[10:44:27] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[10:44:35] <taplar> i'm sure there are plugins out there
[10:44:59] <VarunAgw> Ok!
[10:45:16] <taplar> mikatone: i mentioned earlier with a direct bind you'd have to use off() and the bind the new handler
[10:45:31] <taplar> or use one() and then you wouldn't have to use the off()
[10:45:36] <taplar> but you'd still have to bind the new handler
[11:01:19] <mikatone> taplar nice to talk with you thank you very much for yu help
[11:05:37] <taplar> np
[11:07:04] <giveme5minutes> hello! I have a really random question about the jQuery foundation - I'm thinking of making a donation... but if all the members are volunteers and devs where does the money actually go?
[11:07:20] <giveme5minutes> Is this the right place to ask?
[11:10:06] <taplar> you might try jquery-dev
[11:11:44] <z1haze_work> I am having a strange issue with jqueryui dialogs.. they seem to be very inconsistent with where they are opening on the page - has anyone ever noticed an issue like this? Sometimes it opens at the top, sometimes the middle, and sometimes almost off the screen
[11:16:20] <giveme5minutes> cheers @taplar will do
[11:19:59] <JonelethIrenicus> is there a way to change the text of all buttons of a specific class?
[11:20:11] <taplar> $(selector).text(newValue)
[11:20:14] <JonelethIrenicus> i tried Button.prop('value', 'Lock');
[11:20:39] <taplar> you talking about <button>Me</button> ?
[11:20:56] <JonelethIrenicus> taplar: no a jquery ui button
[11:21:10] <JonelethIrenicus> Button.button( "option", "Lock" )
[11:21:15] <taplar> oh, not sure
[11:21:18] <JonelethIrenicus> where button is a selector of class
[11:21:29] <JonelethIrenicus> it grabs all the buttons of class
[11:55:23] <jomofcw> Hello !
[11:55:35] <jomofcw> Is there an easy way to test if an element is attached to the document ?
[11:56:19] <taplar> if you can find it, it's attached, :D
[11:56:28] <taplar> unless your doing a find on a document fragment
[11:57:06] <jomofcw> taplar hi man ^^ !
[11:57:09] <taplar> yo
[11:57:32] <taplar> alternatively i guess you could do something like closest('body'), but that's a little strange, :)
[11:57:48] <jomofcw> taplar hm i'm giving a look to the contains() method... I can't search it using a selector, I need to check from the jQuery object
[11:58:00] <jomofcw> I find this on stackoverflow :
[11:58:13] <jomofcw> if (!jQuery.contains(document, $foo[0]))
[11:58:51] <taplar> contains searches for text, not elements
[11:58:57] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:59:13] <taplar> unlessi got the wrong api
[11:59:44] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/ ah
[11:59:47] <taplar> so sure
[12:00:02] <jomofcw> taplar you got the right one, but I'm talking about the contains() method : https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[12:00:15] <taplar> but again, how did you get the element in the first place?
[12:00:30] <jomofcw> In fact the nicest things I could find is an event that fired when an element is attached to the DOM... but it probably doesn't exist :/.
[12:00:40] <taplar> nope
[12:00:55] <taplar> that would be something related to mutation observers which aren't widely implimented yet
[12:10:18] <jomofcw> taplar yup :/. i'll find another solution ^^ thanks for your help !
[12:10:23] <jomofcw> Have a nice evening !
[12:26:24] <\monster\> Hi guys, having a weird issue where my ajax call receives a json response which looks correct if I explore it using firebug but once jquery passes it back to success: function(resp){}   it's not what it was before, it's missing values and some are wrong values
[12:26:30] <\monster\> It's weird, never seen this before
[12:26:48] <\monster\> I took the raw json response that the browser sees and tested it with two different validators ..they came back valid
[12:27:30] <taplar> mmm, that would be strange
[12:27:49] <taplar> can you share the json and point out what is 'wrong' ?
[12:27:58] <taplar> *in the success
[12:28:09] <\monster\> hmm let me see if I can get this someone shared
[12:31:35] <taplar> brb, going to get some quick lunch
[12:32:00] <shoky> \monster\ show your code also
[12:38:43] <\monster\> http://pastebin.com/gEpxZtgs   here is the raw json
[12:39:01] <\monster\> http://mynetimages.com/56181053ea.png here is the problem
[12:39:34] <\monster\> top image shows what comes back from jquery ajax call, bottom image is the raw json thats coming from the server
[12:40:42] <\monster\> I'm simply printing out the ajax response as this  http://pastebin.com/YUgSdapK
[12:42:14] <\monster\> No idea what's going on since the json coming from the server looks to be valid
[12:43:26] <shoky> what's AJS.log ?
[12:43:53] <\monster\> oh sorry just my console.log wrapper
[12:45:36] <shoky> uhm what's all that _create, _edit, updateData  stuff..?
[12:45:49] <\monster\> oh wait
[12:45:52] <\monster\> crap
[12:46:14] <\monster\> think i just got bit by references
[12:47:43] <\monster\> shoot heh
[12:48:49] <\monster\> I use the data later on and the changes later get pushed up to the console output way earlier
[12:48:55] * \monster\ hides under a rock
[12:49:18] <\monster\> thought I was losing my mind
[12:49:52] <shoky> ah the live console thing?
[12:50:48] <\monster\> ya I was printing out the ajax resposne right when it arrived but I guess I modify it later on which affects the console output a thousand lines earlier :)
[12:50:56] <shoky> thought firebug was kinda obsolete by now, btw..
[12:51:04] <JonelethIrenicus> is there a way to change the text of all buttons of a specific class?
[12:51:15] <JonelethIrenicus> is there a way to change the text of all buttons of a specific class?
[12:51:20] <JonelethIrenicus> this is for a jquery ui button
[12:51:28] <\monster\> obsolete why? kinda used to it ..know where everything is
[12:51:41] <obert> what means Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined?
[12:51:43] <shoky> because the native devtools are better
[12:52:45] <shoky> JonelethIrenicus: just change the element's text..  $('.classname').text('foo')
[12:53:15] <shoky> obert: it means something is trying to use $ but it is not defined. like code that uses jquery before jquery was even included
[12:54:01] <obert> I included my js script after jquery core
[12:55:13] <shoky> it can also mean that something (like wordpress..) has put jquery in "noConflict" mode,  which only uses `jQuery` and not `$`
[12:55:30] <obert> it's a static page
[12:55:45] <obert> would you see?
[12:55:55] <shoky> if you included jquery before it should be fine
[12:56:00] <shoky> would i see?
[12:56:16] <obert> http://obert.hostfree.pw/gallery.php the script is keyb-navi.js
[12:58:35] <ABM_Dan> For some reason this small plugin is not returning a jquery object
[12:58:36] <ABM_Dan> https://gist.github.com/ABM-Dan/7154d914c8b62fa9b029c987865cbb3a
[12:58:38] <shoky> obert: your hosting is giving problems..  try going to the jquery.js url
[12:58:44] <ABM_Dan> Or at least, not a correct one.
[12:58:55] <shoky> obert:  http://obert.hostfree.pw/js/jquery-3.1.0.min.js
[13:01:28] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan what is it returning, and what are you expecting?
[13:01:35] <shoky> ABM_Dan: use a jquery object and .add() instad of an array.
[13:01:45] <ABM_Dan> it's returning an array of objects I think.
[13:01:46] <shoky> var matched = $();    ...  matched = matched.add(...);
[13:01:59] <robertmaxrees> oh, that'd be it ^
[13:02:01] <ABM_Dan> uh, thanks shoky, that ought to work.
[13:02:20] <obert> shoky: fixed thanks
[13:02:39] <obert> now you can navigate pics via <- and -> keyboard arrows
[13:09:53] <JonelethIrenicus> shoky: that doesn'
[13:10:05] <JonelethIrenicus> shoky: that doesn't work with jquery buttons
[13:10:27] <JonelethIrenicus> shoky: and the Button variable holds references to multiple jquery ui buttons
[13:10:36] <JonelethIrenicus> i am trying to change the text of multiple buttons at once
[13:10:44] <JonelethIrenicus> know how to do that ?
[13:10:52] <JonelethIrenicus> i can change the text of just one no problem
[13:11:07] <shoky> JonelethIrenicus: it should work at least unless they are <input>s.  are your buttons <input>s ?
[13:11:10] <JonelethIrenicus> this works on just one jquery ui button Button.button( "option", "Lock" )
[13:11:23] <shoky> that's not a valid option..
[13:11:36] <JonelethIrenicus> shoky: http://jqueryui.com/button/
[13:11:50] <shoky> oh there's a label option, i missed that before
[13:12:00] <shoky> JonelethIrenicus: yes and that's not how you use the "option" method
[13:12:11] <JonelethIrenicus> shoky: it works
[13:12:12] <shoky> JonelethIrenicus: .button("option", "label", "Lock")
[13:12:24] <shoky> JonelethIrenicus: then it works by accident ;)
[13:12:45] <JonelethIrenicus> shoky: will that work with multiple buttons of class?
[13:12:54] <shoky> JonelethIrenicus: it should
[13:13:10] <JonelethIrenicus> ill try and come back then thanks
[13:28:07] <cydrobolt> hey
[13:28:12] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning
[13:28:15] <cydrobolt> does the element.empty() function accept a callback?
[13:28:23] <cydrobolt> is it synchronous or async?
[13:28:31] <robertmaxrees> should be synchronous
[13:28:32] <taplar> rooob!
[13:28:41] <taplar> you take vaca?
[13:28:43] <cydrobolt> oh, hmm, ok
[13:28:53] <robertmaxrees> taplar nah - had a hack day yesterday.
[13:29:10] <robertmaxrees> exploring react for our frontend.
[13:29:21] <taplar> cool
[13:29:24] <robertmaxrees> very
[13:29:43] <robertmaxrees> cydrobolt why do you ask?
[13:29:49] <taplar> let me know your thoughts on it.  my ux pair likes it.  i still have some gut dislike for the xml stuff
[13:29:59] <cydrobolt> I'm debugging some code where my element is empty for some reason
[13:30:15] <cydrobolt> I'm trying to set up a graph using d3 but I'm doing $target.empty() before setting up the graph
[13:30:19] <robertmaxrees> taplar we had a few people that felt the same way but after actually using JSX they totally understood the benefits.
[13:30:31] <cydrobolt> I was wondering if the empty could be async and running *after* the graph is set up, thus clearing it
[13:30:48] <robertmaxrees> cydrobolt nope.  empty is a "sync" dealio since it relies on the document.
[13:31:01] <cydrobolt> ic
[13:41:22] <hellyeah> yo
[13:41:44] <robertmaxrees> sup.
[13:42:29] <hellyeah> not much what about you? Finally have github page
[13:45:17] <hellyeah> wow taplar is not here
[13:45:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah he is.
[13:45:36] <hellyeah> hmm he is hiding
[13:45:44] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:45:46] <hellyeah> well i will teach js to one of my friend :D
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> kay.
[13:45:55] <hellyeah> he is not speaking i mean
[13:46:03] <robertmaxrees> doesn't mean he's hiding lol
[13:46:12] <hellyeah> that was a joke
[13:46:13] <hellyeah> :D
[13:46:31] <taplar> wut?
[13:46:40] <taplar> ah
[13:46:40] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:46:44] <taplar> super busy
[13:47:10] <hellyeah> are you writing jquery everyday taplar ?
[13:47:16] <hellyeah> or are you front end guy?
[13:47:25] <taplar> i'm an all around guy
[13:47:51] <taplar> i'm what they call, "a grunt"
[13:48:18] <hellyeah> i dont know what "a grunt" means
[13:48:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:48:27] <robertmaxrees> taplar is one.
[13:48:33] <taplar> :) peon, grunt, bottom of the food chain
[13:48:39] <robertmaxrees> pfff.
[13:48:43] <robertmaxrees> you need to come work for us.
[13:48:51] <robertmaxrees> you'd be the middle of the food chain ;)
[13:48:55] <taplar> lol
[13:49:07] <taplar> but then i'd have to move and sell my house and all that.  meh
[13:49:32] <robertmaxrees> you're in... chicago?  i can't remember what metro you're in.
[13:49:35] <hellyeah> so you are full stack
[13:49:40] <taplar> little rock
[13:49:44] <robertmaxrees> thaaaat's right.
[13:50:06] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah technically all web devs are "full stack" to some degree ;)
[13:50:06] <antraxis> I'm looking for some idea what to develop for resale for other html/css/js developers - I mean not a whole web templates, but maybe some kind of components which other people would find useful and save their time. Any ideas?
[13:50:08] <hellyeah> well i appreciate your help everytime
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> antraxis wordpress plugins.
[13:50:26] <hellyeah> i know fullstack like backend + frontend
[13:50:37] <hellyeah> am i wrong?
[13:50:52] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah "backend" can be a pretty big area.
[13:50:59] <taplar> ba dump chi
[13:51:14] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[13:51:15] <hellyeah> yeah i know
[13:51:25] <taplar> but yah, i refer it back end and front end as full
[13:51:48] <taplar> i tinker with it all other than hardware and networking
[13:53:44] <hellyeah> what language are you using at backend? node.js
[13:53:47] <hellyeah> ?
[13:53:51] <taplar> groovy/grails
[13:54:36] <hellyeah> never heard those
[13:54:56] <taplar> they're progressions of java
[13:55:32] <robertmaxrees> Groovy's like Rails/Python for the JVM.  Grails is a Rails-like framework for Groovy.
[13:55:55] <robertmaxrees> errr, *Ruby/Python
[13:56:57] <hellyeah> was groovy framework?
[13:57:05] <robertmaxrees> Groovy is a language.
[13:57:09] <taplar> grails is the framework
[13:57:09] <robertmaxrees> Grails is a framework.
[13:57:13] <hellyeah> ic
[13:57:19] <hellyeah> let me check
[13:57:52] <hellyeah> so you write web app with java
[13:57:57] <robertmaxrees> *Groovy
[13:58:24] <robertmaxrees> when you think "java" you're actually thinking about 2 separate parts: the language and the JVM, which is the thing the langauge runs on.
[13:58:59] <hellyeah> Java virtual machine
[13:59:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:59:06] <ABM_Dan> "which one is javascript?"
[13:59:12] <taplar> huh?
[13:59:15] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:59:18] <hellyeah> what do you mean?
[13:59:21] <ABM_Dan> nothing, memories of times past.
[13:59:25] <taplar> javascript is complete unrelated
[13:59:34] <ABM_Dan> I know, sorry, it was off topic.
[13:59:34] <robertmaxrees> oh.  the java/javascript confusion.
[13:59:43] <hellyeah> js is not java
[13:59:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:59:59] <hellyeah> not related
[14:00:01] <robertmaxrees> java and javascript are about as related as car and carpet
[14:00:32] <hellyeah> :D
[14:00:51] <robertmaxrees> though apparently the new js engine for the JVM is actually pretty good.
[14:01:39] <hellyeah> ecmascript 2016?
[14:01:42] <taplar> there's a C implementation for running PHP as a drop in for apache that some said ran faster than the native binaries
[14:01:59] <robertmaxrees> taplar isn't that from facebook?
[14:02:09] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah es2016 is the current version of ECMAScript.
[14:02:09] <taplar> or maybe it was a java implementation, i forget.  i just remember it was a dropin
[14:02:19] <robertmaxrees> JS is an implementation of ECMAScript.
[14:03:00] <ABM_Dan> where "an" is an euphemism for what is pretty much "the".
[14:03:11] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[14:03:16] <robertmaxrees> unless you're talking about microsoft ;)
[14:03:33] <hellyeah> dont understand the question
[14:03:33] <ABM_Dan> is jscript still a thing?
[14:03:35] <robertmaxrees> taplar http://hhvm.com/ this what you're thinking of?
[14:03:45] <hellyeah> js is still a thing
[14:03:51] <robertmaxrees> that's not what he asked hellyeah ;)
[14:03:58] <ABM_Dan> not javascript, jscript, microsoft's.
[14:04:03] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan it's still technically in use in the wild.
[14:04:04] <hellyeah> you dont have anything for browser instead of js
[14:04:13] <taplar> some reason i don't think so.  let me google a bit
[14:04:17] <hellyeah> what the duck is jscript?
[14:04:27] <robertmaxrees> microsoft's version of ecmascript.
[14:04:36] <robertmaxrees> it's the version used in IE.
[14:04:45] <robertmaxrees> edge uses javascript thouh.
[14:04:46] <ABM_Dan> oh wow, there's even JScript.NET.
[14:04:46] <taplar> been a few years
[14:04:52] <ABM_Dan> I... wow.
[14:05:10] <robertmaxrees> oh nevermind.  they stopped in IE 9.
[14:05:31] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, they embraced ecmascript as a server-side language much earlier than lots of other folks.
[14:05:39] <hellyeah> it was in 1996 or something right when ecma script is at the beginning.
[14:05:43] <hellyeah> is it that?
[14:05:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:06:22] <hellyeah> they produced something instead of ecma script for i.e. in 1996 or something
[14:06:48] <robertmaxrees> what in the world are you talking about
[14:06:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:06:59] <ABM_Dan> jscript is an implementation of ecma that is not javascript
[14:07:19] <hellyeah> nevermind
[14:07:20] <robertmaxrees> old versions of IE supported vbscript and other jank, but jscript is basically javascript, just a different name.
[14:07:27] <taplar> Ouercus
[14:07:30] <taplar> Quercus
[14:07:34] <hellyeah> i heard that on video
[14:08:06] <taplar> http://www.caucho.com/resin-3.1/doc/quercus.xtp
[14:08:07] <robertmaxrees> iiiiinteresting.
[14:08:28] <taplar> worked fine and was an easy thing to do for local servers developing php
[14:09:56] <hellyeah> my counter didnt work
[14:09:57] <hellyeah> damn it
[14:11:27] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[14:16:26] <antraxis> jscript IS javascript but microsoft had to rename it due to copyright problems, some other company already owned that name (i guess it was netscape), Douglas Crockford explains this in one of his presentations
[14:16:35] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:16:45] <robertmaxrees> there were some quirks with their implementation, though.
[14:17:01] <robertmaxrees> but largely, yes, it is javascript.
[14:18:03] <antraxis> yeah, the fact there were differences doesn't mean it still was a javascript, just beeing created in difficult times, when not everything was documented, and people from microsoft had even to do some reverse engineering of javascript
[14:18:10] <hellyeah> why they implement something when original javascript is around?
[14:18:26] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah because every browser needs a version to run.
[14:18:49] <robertmaxrees> antraxis right.
[14:18:50] <hellyeah> i dont like microsoftr
[14:18:54] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:19:16] <hellyeah> they become open source now
[14:19:32] <hellyeah> they release new version of asp.net open source
[14:19:51] <hellyeah> ie sucks
[14:19:52] <antraxis> hellyeah: because original javascript was owned by Sun or Netscape (in fact Javascript was created by one of the Sun employees) and Microsoft couldn't use it directly in their browser for some reason
[14:20:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.  which is why they stopped working on IE.
[14:20:14] <robertmaxrees> .NET core was open-sourced, which is a good thing.
[14:21:08] <hellyeah> some reason? can you be more spesific?
[14:21:18] <robertmaxrees> they wanted to avoid a lawsuit.
[14:21:24] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:21:30] <robertmaxrees> copyright.
[14:21:43] <hellyeah> understand
[14:23:05] <antraxis> hellyeah: no i can't because i was watching Dragon Ball and playing Lego when all of this was happening ;p
[14:23:19] <taplar> playing Lefo?
[14:23:24] <taplar> s/Lefo/Lego
[14:23:24] <b-ot> Correction, <taplar> playing Lego?
[14:23:50] <antraxis> yeah, building stuff of lego blocks
[14:23:50] <taplar> you were depriving your family members of tastey waffles?
[14:23:58] <hellyeah> antraxis:  hahaha
[14:24:03] <robertmaxrees> l'eggo
[14:25:56] <taplar> it's cool, i l'eggo it
[14:26:11] <taplar> *sighs* back to work
[14:54:07] <taplar> mmm free ice cream
[14:57:15] <robertmaxrees> luckyyyyyy
[14:57:53] <taplar> no clue y.  not going to deny it, :)
[15:23:50] <moparisthebest> is there any way to intercept all outgoing get/post requests so I can append a parameter? :/
[15:24:28] <HowardwLo> hey folks! I can’t seem to figure out why this is doing this: https://dpaste.de/RKRW.
[15:24:52] <HowardwLo> tehre is a script that changes the data-value of the element, but when i try to grab it it doesn’t come otu the same
[15:25:23] <HowardwLo> line 6 keeps returning the default value
[15:27:06] <decx> let me guess.. .attr('data-value', mynewhex)
[15:36:42] <HowardwLo> decx: ya, pretty much
[15:37:18] <HowardwLo> decx: shoudl that be .data(‘value’) ?
[15:37:28] <decx> indeed
[15:38:26] <HowardwLo> i think the reason why i used attr was becuase “$(this).data('value', color.toHexString());” didn’t update data-value properly
[15:38:32] <HowardwLo> so i guess i have another problem :D
[15:40:13] <HowardwLo> oh right, this was the one that didn’t update the data-value in dom :|
[15:40:48] <decx> well the dom data- attribute is just a vessel to transport the info into a dataset
[15:52:22] <HowardwLo> thanks decx
[16:40:52] <soulisson> Hi, is it correct "we select all the elements of type img"
[16:41:17] <taplar> tagName
[16:41:33] <taplar> is the dom lingo
[16:41:56] <robertmaxrees> "all img tags"
[16:42:41] <soulisson> robertmaxrees, in the absolute is it false to refer to an img element as "an element of type img"?
[16:42:59] <taplar> absolutes are weird
[16:43:08] <taplar> does the person your talking to understand you?
[16:43:12] <robertmaxrees> "element of type"?
[16:43:13] <taplar> that's really the key
[16:43:15] <robertmaxrees> they're img tags.
[16:43:47] <soulisson> taplar, yes, I meant would it be acceptable for someone if I phrased it that way
[16:44:08] <taplar> who is your audience?
[16:44:52] <soulisson> taplar, devs mainly
[16:44:58] <robertmaxrees> call 'em elements
[16:46:12] <soulisson> ok, so img elements implies elements which name is img, right?
[16:46:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:46:24] <taplar> yep, since you said 'img'
[16:46:37] <taplar> if you said 'image' it might have some confusion, but *shrug*
[16:46:51] <soulisson> ok, thanks, trying to get familiar with the terminology
[16:46:54] <robertmaxrees> are you talking about jquery in this case, soulisson?
[16:47:00] <soulisson> have a nice evening
[16:47:02] <robertmaxrees> because if so, then people will know exactly what you mean.
[16:47:43] <soulisson> robertmaxrees, yes, jquery, html in general
[16:48:18] <taplar> "we select all images on the page" would make sense to me
[16:48:44] <taplar> if your familiar with html, since they are devs as your audience, this would be fine to me
[16:54:03] <taplar> soulisson: you making some sort of presentation?
[16:54:46] <soulisson> taplar, yes, indeed
[17:33:25] <taplar> sloooooow
[18:10:44] <dmarr> I'm trying to setup a loader for react and react-dom to load but it seems the loadScripts().then call doesn't have the globals loaded https://gist.github.com/marr/f51e78c043dee8681a8c29daf911e643
[18:11:12] <dmarr> I thought I understood deferreds...
[18:12:16] <robertmaxrees> "the globals loaded"?
[18:12:29] <robertmaxrees> you mean it doesn't look like the scripts have executed?
[18:12:50] <robertmaxrees> also: return $.ajax(script, { cache: true }) - this doesn't execute the js.
[18:13:03] <robertmaxrees> you want https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[18:13:14] <robertmaxrees> though this is really what you use something like require for.
[18:14:03] <dmarr> robertmaxrees: yes it doesn't look like the scripts have executed
[18:14:33] <dmarr> but after a second i see the globals (React, ReactDOM) on the window
[18:14:48] <dmarr> so that makes me think that $.ajax does eventually execute them
[18:14:50] <robertmaxrees> you should use getscript for this instead.
[18:14:57] <robertmaxrees> since it was designed for it.
[18:15:26] <robertmaxrees> wait back up real quick.
[18:15:34] <robertmaxrees> why are you loading these like this in the first place?
[18:16:59] <dmarr> well im injecting this whole mess via $.getScript on an existing page
[18:17:06] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[18:17:08] <dmarr> because its an experiment
[18:17:21] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:17:33] <dmarr> and yes require would be ok
[18:18:03] <dmarr> since am browserifying this
[18:18:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm so confused but OK.
[18:18:31] <dmarr> except i want to use the globals in the page.. since they may exist
[18:18:40] <robertmaxrees> either way, you'd need to use getScript and not ajax.
[18:18:57] <robertmaxrees> getscript resolves when the scripts have executed last i checked.
[18:19:11] <robertmaxrees> or you might have to use the callback.
[18:19:12] <robertmaxrees> not sure.
[18:19:20] <shoky> dmarr you're the one i mentioned browserify-shim to in another channel, right?
[18:19:26] <dmarr> yes
[18:19:35] <shoky> why oh why did you get from that to trying to load it with jquery :S
[18:19:35] <dmarr> shoky: i did get that working
[18:19:56] <dmarr> but now since i am browserifying the bundle i still need those globals to be on the page
[18:20:13] <robertmaxrees> why not download these and actually package the files in then?
[18:20:17] <shoky> huh. i don't understand what you just said
[18:20:44] <shoky> if you're browserifying, and browserify-shim works.. everything should work with require() no?
[18:20:45] <dmarr> like i want to use the cdnjs react / reactdom
[18:20:55] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:21:00] <shoky> right, hence browserify-shim
[18:21:20] <dmarr> the page that im injecting has some jquery and react on it
[18:21:33] <robertmaxrees> i mean the cdnjs versions.
[18:21:33] <shoky> injecting?
[18:21:40] <robertmaxrees> but it sounds like shoky gave you what you need here
[18:22:15] <dmarr> shoky: im browserifying and calling that with a $.getScript
[18:22:38] <shoky> mmm
[18:22:51] <dmarr> so im getting the globals on the page and then running the things that rely on them
[18:23:42] <dmarr> im just really confused why those loading functions aren't running as I expect
[18:23:44] <shoky> you lost me :|
[18:24:02] <robertmaxrees> you need to use .getScript instead of ajax for them, but you're overcomplicating it.
[18:24:21] <robertmaxrees> if it's just a test, download the files and call it a day.
[18:28:44] <dmarr> robertmaxrees: the getScript vs ajax thing doesn't matter
[18:29:00] <robertmaxrees> getScript's callback fires when code's executed.
[18:29:34] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm.
[18:29:51] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:30:06] <robertmaxrees> welp.  then i wouldn't use jquery to load these.
[18:30:28] <dmarr> i can't control the source except for the initial $.getScript
[18:30:48] <dmarr> the script that loads is my "client" and it loads react, and then renders a component
[18:30:54] <robertmaxrees> so you can't just download those two files and package them together?
[18:32:59] <dmarr> im downloading the files in serial, but the callback appears to not have them loaded
[18:33:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:33:11] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening to me.
[18:33:13] <dmarr> file1.then(file2.then(...nothing))
[18:33:40] <dmarr> i guess im gonna have to go down the vendor bundle path
[18:33:47] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:33:55] <robertmaxrees> because jquery can't really know when it's don't running.
[18:34:13] <dmarr> its a sync js file though
[18:34:20] <robertmaxrees> the loading isn't sync.,
[18:34:38] <robertmaxrees> all the ajax methods know is that it successfully finished downloading.
[18:34:39] <robertmaxrees> nothing else.
[18:35:21] <shoky> i always forget when you can add a <script> element dynamically and have that load the script.. and when you can't.  and when jquery does this or that
[18:36:18] <dmarr> maybe this is the issue
[18:36:19] <dmarr> As of jQuery 1.8, the use of async: false with jqXHR ($.Deferred) is deprecated; you must use the success/error/complete callback options instead of the corresponding methods of the jqXHR object such as jqXHR.done().
[18:36:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:36:42] <shoky> you're not using async: false tho
[18:36:56] <dmarr> right but thats the behavior i want
[18:37:07] <dmarr> so it sounds like i need to use $.ajax's success config option
[18:37:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:37:10] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:37:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:37:13] <dmarr> dude
[18:37:14] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening.
[18:37:15] <shoky> hrm and docs aren't helping me remember.. they say  "... for requests that use a <script> tag (that is, a type of script or jsonp). "
[18:37:47] <shoky> implying that $.getScript uses a <script> tag and not ajax..
[18:38:05] <robertmaxrees> but the deferred fires when the network request is done.
[18:38:06] <shoky> yet other places in the docs say it uses ajax and evals the response.
[18:38:38] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/ -> under "Success Callback": "
[18:38:38] <robertmaxrees> The callback is fired once the script has been loaded but not necessarily executed.
[18:39:31] <shoky> ok. but is it ajax or a <script> tag?
[18:39:35] <dmarr> robertmaxrees: i do want these requests cached, so getScript isn't right here
[18:39:48] <robertmaxrees> ajax is going to have the exact same problem.
[18:42:02] <shoky> think he means that getScript sets the cache option to false but he doesn't want that
[18:42:32] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) using ajax isn't going to fix the original problem unless there's something really weird going on.
[18:43:03] <shoky> rright
[19:14:28] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[19:14:35] <taplar> :)
[19:22:34] <dmarr> robertmaxrees: shoky i think the context of the .then callback was tripping me up
[19:22:54] <dmarr> i was trying to console.log(React) in it, and it was undefined. but window.React was react
[19:23:11] <dmarr> in any case i'm still scrapping all this getScript bs and using a bundle
[19:23:28] <dmarr> 250k gzipped /shrug
[19:23:29] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:23:46] <robertmaxrees> console.log(React) will log out the first object in the current scope chain that matches that value.
[19:23:54] <robertmaxrees> which can go all the way to the window object.
[19:24:04] <robertmaxrees> wince window.React would just be the global React object.
[19:24:15] <robertmaxrees> *since
[19:24:23] <dmarr> yeah maybe the browserify-shim or browserify munge was breaking it
[19:24:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:24:43] <robertmaxrees> fundamental rules of JS - that's how scopes inherently work.
[19:38:40] <dmarr> robertmaxrees: so console.log(React, window.React) should be the same thing?
[19:38:45] <dmarr> (they arent)
[19:39:14] <robertmaxrees> then you have React declared in a scope somewhere below window and where you're calling the console.log from.
[19:39:52] <dmarr> yeah i think its a subset called global in browserify
[19:40:00] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:40:10] <dmarr> hold on i'll try to write a test
[19:40:48] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/23497788 -> "(browserify sets the global object to window [...]"
[20:32:27] <dmarr> but if you write to window, won't global be out of sync?
[22:23:00] <ElectricAlan> hello all, wondering if I can get an insight onto this error I'm getting, the swiper plugin is trying to load versions of all my images with '@2x' at the end of the file name
[22:24:24] <ElectricAlan> and it only happens on my desktop browser if I load the page in device mode using the dev tools
[22:32:39] <ElectricAlan> sry I'm not sure how to reproduce this issue in a jsfiddle or soemthing, and I don't think I'm supposed to give public access out, as the page in question is pw protected
