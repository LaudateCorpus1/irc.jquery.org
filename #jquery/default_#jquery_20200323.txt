[06:26:13] <littlebit> hi people, I have been using jquery to give my page a more dynamic feel and along with jquey I use django to handle the requests. I have reaached to a point where my jquery code fires a post request to django. django returns a http response code of 200 but the error function gets triggered containing the response from django with a http code of 200 in it.
[06:26:17] <littlebit> what am I missing here?
[06:26:54] <Cork> you mist likely have a code error somewhere
[06:27:04] <Cork> check what arguments your error function gets
[06:32:14] <littlebit> Cork: wewll this is my call: http://dpaste.com/2XDWTAH
[06:32:46] <Cork> littlebit: check the tree arguments given to error
[06:33:43] <littlebit> Cork: one sec
[06:33:47] <littlebit> Cork: ur right
[06:33:53] <Cork> also your format looks wrong
[06:34:27] <Cork> but ya, error will tell you
[06:42:03] <errorous> hello. I have an array of objects, each having many property/value pairs. How would I search/replace values the easies?
[06:42:16] <errorous> I can do each in each. is there any better solution?
[06:42:45] <Cork> no, you will have to double loop
[06:42:56] <errorous> ok, thanks Cork
[06:45:18] <littlebit> Cork: ok, I found the error and it was that I left the dataType parameter in there and django was returning a html
[06:45:34] <Cork> ah
[06:45:40] <littlebit> Cork: yet the browser doesn't load the content
[06:46:20] <Cork> what content-type header does the server respond with?
[06:51:31] <littlebit> Cork: content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
[06:57:00] <Cork> littlebit: then dataType shouldn't matter
[06:57:33] <littlebit> Cork:
[06:57:40] <Cork> littlebit: dataType just sets the accept header content-type still controlls what it gets parsed as (so it gets read as text)
[06:58:00] <littlebit> Cork: true, maybe i close and open the browser
[07:01:26] <littlebit> Cork: yet that didn't change anything
[07:02:47] <Cork> littlebit: you can remove the dataType if the server deosn't support submitting that anyway
[07:03:55] <littlebit> Cork: I removed that already. now it has the following parameter: url data type
[17:26:52] <GrandPa-G> if I do a $lastRow = $table.find('tbody tr:last'); followed by $lastRow.eq(0).after($clone);
[17:26:52] <GrandPa-G>  shouldn't $lastRow = $table.find('tbody tr:last');  now be pointing to newly cloned row?
[17:55:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:56:13] <robertmaxrees> GrandPa-G do you mean "why doesn't $lastRow update"?
[17:57:06] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees:I think so. if I put this in a loop for several clones, only one clone shows.
[17:57:45] <GrandPa-G> I pasted the wrong last line.
[17:58:04] <robertmaxrees> so what's the right last line?
[17:58:05] <GrandPa-G> sb $lastRow.after($clone);
[17:58:18] <robertmaxrees> ah - well yeah.  when you do var $lastRow = $table.find('tbody tr:last');, you're getting whatever the last <tr> is at the time you run that code.
[17:58:19] <GrandPa-G> sorry, the middle line.
[17:58:36] <robertmaxrees> if you add more <tr>, you have to do $lastRow = $table.find('tbody tr:last'); again
[17:59:42] <GrandPa-G> so my loop loop is find tr last, clone. Why shouldn't second time through loop add clone as number 2 and then 3 and... row? I only get 2 no matter how many times I go through a loop
[18:00:22] <robertmaxrees> show me your code.
[18:00:35] <robertmaxrees> in a jsfiddle.
[18:00:57] <GrandPa-G> that is hard to do, but I will try
[18:01:10] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: your explanation isn't making any sense :)
[18:02:18] <GrandPa-G> I know, but a simple 3 step loop. a for n times, get last row, clone, repeat
[18:02:28] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:02:33] <robertmaxrees> what is $clone in this case?
[18:05:20] <robertmaxrees> GrandPa-G do you mean you're doing something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/camp8to9/
[18:07:29] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees:thanks for typing it. Probably close enough. I had <thead> but I doubt that makes any difference. Let me try what you gave me. thanks
[18:07:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm asking if my fiddle resembles your code and problem heh
[18:08:15] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't have a fix in it.  just trying to confirm the bug.
[18:11:15] <GrandPa-G> very much like mine. I am trying to replicate in the real environment.
[18:11:50] <robertmaxrees> ok, so you're cloning before the loop and then trying to insert inside the loop, yes?
[18:13:41] <GrandPa-G> yes. I think I copied yours exactly, will recheck. I only get 1 foo
[18:13:54] <GrandPa-G> what jquery are you using?
[18:13:59] <robertmaxrees> why are you coping mine?
[18:14:06] <robertmaxrees> *copying
[18:14:51] <GrandPa-G> I want to go with something that I can see works, then drop in my environment. Something is getting in the way. Might be some scripts I am using.
[18:14:59] <robertmaxrees> i just said
[18:15:04] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't have a fix in it.
[18:15:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to replicate your bug to help you understand how to fix it.
[18:16:52] <GrandPa-G> I understand that, but if it should work that way in jsfiddle, it should work that way in my page. It doesn't so it should not be the code snippet you have. I need to look elsewhere
[18:17:18] <robertmaxrees> can you just share your code then?
[18:17:27] <robertmaxrees> just the table and the relevant bit of js?
[18:19:13] <GrandPa-G> I really don't think so, not that I don't want to or want your help. It is ~1400 lines and uses local js scripts.
[18:20:14] <robertmaxrees> doesn't have to be the whole page :) not really clear why a test case is so elusive here but alright :)
[18:23:11] <GrandPa-G> I will see what I can do.
[18:30:45] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees:will you be around for awhile? Just curious in case I get a jsfiddle up
[18:32:19] <robertmaxrees> just drop it to the channel.  if somebody can help, they will :)
[18:32:27] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be that difficult though :/
[18:44:17] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees:I am close to a simple example.
[18:48:16] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees:novice with jsfiddle, how do I save to let you see it?
[18:48:34] <robertmaxrees> top left, should be a "save" button/
[18:48:40] <robertmaxrees> click that, then copy the URL
[18:49:12] <GrandPa-G> that must mean I need to be logged?
[18:49:26] <robertmaxrees> nop.e  can do it logged out, too.
[18:50:33] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/AJIjqge.png do you not have this icon?
[18:51:27] <GrandPa-G> nope, just run, fork, update
[18:51:35] <robertmaxrees> oh, hit "update.
[18:51:39] <robertmaxrees> then share out th enew url.
[18:51:41] <robertmaxrees> *the new
[18:53:46] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[18:59:51] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees:see if this is valid https://jsfiddle.net/2mLn7xfd/ I am sure I am missing something simple.
[19:00:38] <robertmaxrees> that seems to be working fine?
[19:01:16] <robertmaxrees> though your code structure is really strange/
[19:02:16] <robertmaxrees> or are you expecting 3 rows to get appended?
[19:03:00] <robertmaxrees> graingert
[19:03:06] <robertmaxrees> woops - bad autocmplete :|
[19:03:10] <robertmaxrees> GrandPa-G
[19:03:39] <graingert> Lol
[19:04:05] <robertmaxrees> sorrryyy '_
[19:04:08] <robertmaxrees> * ;)
[19:04:10] <GrandPa-G> ok, what is a gringert????
[19:04:24] <robertmaxrees> that was a mistake on my part :)
[19:04:33] <graingert> I'm no mistake
[19:04:35] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue in your fiddle?
[19:04:48] <graingert> What taters eh?
[19:04:55] <GrandPa-G> yes, I want 4 for that loop, yes?
[19:04:56] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[19:05:08] <robertmaxrees> GrandPa-G okay, so your issue is simple./
[19:05:32] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees:I know I am simple, but, really.....
[19:05:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm not calling you simple.
[19:05:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm explaning the problem.  chill :)
[19:06:05] <robertmaxrees> when you do var $clone = $lastRow.clone();, you're making a single copy.  any time you then try to do something using $clone, you're actually moving that same copy around.
[19:06:06] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees:I know, trying at a small amount of humor.
[19:06:57] <GrandPa-G> my desire is to see the foo record duplicated n times based on the loop. I am only getting 1 extra row
[19:07:08] <robertmaxrees> one sec, typing it out.
[19:07:17] <robertmaxrees> the "smarter" way to handle this so to just do $lastRow.after($lastRow.clone());.  Or, even better, $table.find('tbody').append($lastRow.clone());
[19:08:33] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eb5ow1Lz/4/
[19:08:37] <robertmaxrees> (for your daily freebie)
[19:09:15] <GrandPa-G> I used the first, worked like a champ. I have to digest it. I did something like that, but just didn't get it quit right. See, that is always easy when you are the expert.
[19:09:45] <robertmaxrees> do you get what the issue was, though?
[19:10:25] <GrandPa-G> wouldn't the first be a very tiny improvement in resource since you don't have to do the find every time in the loop. Not important in a < 10 row loop.
[19:10:53] <robertmaxrees> check out the diffle.
[19:10:55] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle
[19:11:00] <robertmaxrees> for the way i'd do it.
[19:11:12] <robertmaxrees> and try < hundreds ;)_
[19:11:32] <robertmaxrees> was just trying to give you the gist.
[19:12:30] <robertmaxrees> an even better way would be like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eb5ow1Lz/9/
[19:12:43] <GrandPa-G> yes, but I use your exact idea, I will owe you a bazillion $$$. I really appreciate you patience and help. I have learned 1 new thing today. That almost exceedes my daily limit.
[19:13:51] <robertmaxrees> oh and get that css out of your html ;)
[19:15:02] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees:again, I really appreciate the help. I was going in circle too long. Thanks
[19:15:09] <robertmaxrees> :) sure :)
[19:22:45] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees:added into real page, works like a champ
[19:22:52] <robertmaxrees> cool :)
