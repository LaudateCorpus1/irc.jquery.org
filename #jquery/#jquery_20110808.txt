[00:27:26] <jomofcw> Hello =)
[00:27:50] <xec> hello jomofcw!
[00:31:06] <wangdoo> xec: Is it possible to bind keypress event?
[00:31:22] <xec> absolutely!
[00:31:32] <xec> good enough answer? :D
[00:32:40] <wangdoo> xec: Say,i have a text box .You i/p some data ,after pressing enter,i want to alert it.
[00:32:55] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/euk8R/
[00:34:02] <xec> replace document with a selector for your text box, and the keycode for esc with the keycode for enter, i guess
[00:35:04] <wangdoo> xec: You codes work in fiddle but not in my local
[00:35:49] <wangdoo> xec: I'm using this plugin http://projects.alicialiu.net/jquery-tagify-demo/.after,i get i/p,i should be able to alert them
[00:35:52] <xec> do you have an url?
[00:38:48] <xec> wangdoo: http://aspdotnetfaq.com/Faq/What-is-the-list-of-KeyCodes-for-JavaScript-KeyDown-KeyPress-and-KeyUp-events.aspx
[00:39:00] <xec> enter = 13 apparently
[00:39:29] <wangdoo> xec: I know it but it is not working for some other reason.Have you seen that plug in.Pls,help me with this.
[00:40:04] <xec> never tried tagify no
[00:40:23] <xec> but it looks very cool
[00:40:32] <wangdoo> xec:  yep
[00:41:03] <wangdoo> xec: Can you help me on htis?
[00:41:12] <wangdoo> xec: *this
[00:41:54] <xec> probably not, but i can have a look if you have a url
[00:45:09] <wangdoo> xec here it is http://jsfiddle.net/npe7C/1/ but i have attached keypress event.You would be probably i/p in 1 cell and press enter,You should alert the value
[00:47:33] <xec> is rowID a jQuery object ?
[00:48:20] <xec> and where is the text box?
[00:48:36] <wangdoo> xec:  you'ii get id of a row.
[00:49:02] <xec> exactly. keydown() is a jquery method, youll need to call is on a jquery object
[00:49:08] <xec> it*
[00:49:35] <wangdoo> xec: How to do it?
[00:50:20] <wangdoo> xec:  slector.tagify() assigned to a var and var is what i binded to keypress
[00:50:52] <xec> also, your keydown is inside of a click event? is this on purpose?
[00:51:11] <xec> please tell exactly what your code is supposed to do
[00:55:40] <wangdoo> xec: I'm trying to i/p tags for a column.When you click on rcords,you can enter tags,after pressing enter,i need those i/p tags
[00:58:44] <xec> sry, i dont follow
[00:58:48] <xec> whats i/p?
[00:59:03] <xec> and rcords?
[00:59:27] <wangdoo> xec:it means input
[00:59:41] <wangdoo> xec: recors is a tr
[00:59:50] <wangdoo> xec: each td is column
[01:00:26] <JKarsrud> are there any known performance issues with animate() in fx5?
[01:06:17] <__machine> can you not target a div with an arbitrary attribute? eg. $('div[data-pk=5]') doesnt seem to target <div data-pk="5"> ?
[01:11:48] <sasori> hi, what's the least possible cause of an internal server error of a jquery ajax processing?, am seeing that 500 internal server error via console of firebug, and there's no written stuff at the response tab :(
[01:12:20] <ravenzz> a wrong url
[01:12:37] <ravenzz> wrong datatype
[01:12:42] <ravenzz> ?demo
[01:12:42] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:13:03] <xec> __machine: that should work afaik
[01:14:03] <sasori> ravenzz: which datatype are you referring to?, database table ?
[01:14:20] <ravenzz> __machine you should quote the value $('div[data-pk="5"]')
[01:14:21] <xec> __machine: you could also try $('div[data-pk="5"]')
[01:14:49] <xec> my testcase works without though http://jsfiddle.net/Yy7yp/
[01:14:51] <go> do you guys know of any webbased IDE that can be installed on a webserver? I'd need FTP, git and/or SVN support in it.
[01:15:30] <__machine> xec, weird i tried quoting and it didnt work... must be some other problem with my code...
[01:15:56] <maqr> i think i found a jQuery bug, any devs around?
[01:15:58] <ravenzz> sasori no the one you are expecting (dataType) or sending (contentType) from the server.
[01:16:12] <xec> maqr: try #jquery-dev
[01:16:20] <sasori> ok
[01:16:22] <maqr> ty
[01:16:23] <ravenzz> __machine is it unique?
[01:16:51] <ravenzz> __machine console.log($('div[data-pk="5"]'));
[01:17:46] <__machine> ravenzz: it is unique, and i was checking .length to see if it matched any elements... even if not unique, it should have been non-zero
[01:18:48] <ravenzz> __machine ok from now, i need a livedemo
[01:18:56] <ravenzz> otherwise i can't help you
[01:20:56] <maqr> if i'm setting "username" and "password" as options for ajax(), why wouldn't it be sending the auth to the server?
[01:20:56] <__machine> ravenzz: sorry, must be a problem elsewhere in my code... i will post a live demo next time
[01:21:11] <maqr> i think there might be some negotiation process that makes it determine that it's http basic, but i can't quite figure it out
[01:23:40] <maqr> any tips would be appreciated, i'm a bit stuck :/
[01:26:12] <wangdoo> xec: YOU THERE?
[01:26:56] * xec hides
[01:30:16] <sasori> what dataType should I put if am getting the data from ordinary forms and post it to be processed by php  , ( jquery ajax )
[01:30:50] <hooloovoo> what you want
[01:30:56] <hooloovoo> json is popular
[01:35:23] <wangdoo> Is there any other ways to read tags without using .('serialise') .Look at this http://projects.alicialiu.net/jquery-tagify-demo/
[01:37:53] <wangdoo> __machine: Is there any other ways to read tags without using   .tagify('serialise') .Look at this http://projects.alicialiu.net/jquery-tagify-demo/
[01:47:38] <wangdoo> how to append single quotes to a variable
[01:51:12] <quicksilver> foo = foo + "'"
[02:04:28] <wangdoo> quicksilver: i get single quotes but my problem is not solved.
[02:04:45] <wangdoo> quicksilver: Can you help me with this http://projects.alicialiu.net/jquery-tagify-demo/?
[02:06:12] <luaa> sean`: are you there?

[02:11:06] <donCams> hi guys... http://pastebin.com/dMjjxcL4 result.pages is undefined. why?
[02:11:09] <donCams> http://pastebin.com/0kiczQsr

[02:21:53] <wangdoo> donCams: Have any one used jquery tagify?
[02:23:35] <sean`> ?anyone @ wangdoo
[02:23:35] <bot-t> wangdoo, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[02:24:16] <donCams> sean`, any idea why in firebug, response is {"pages":"3"} but when I alert(result.pages); it says undefined
[02:24:37] <wangdoo> bot-t:  :)
[02:24:37] <bot-t> :)

[02:25:33] <bot-t> wangdoo, My reply is no.
[02:25:49] <wangdoo> bot-t: :)
[02:25:50] <bot-t> :)
[02:25:54] <donCams> wang, why are you talking to a bot?

[02:26:33] <donCams> thanks sean`
[02:28:20] <wangdoo> bot-t:  my problem is when i use .tagify('serialize').I'm unable to input tags into it.
[02:28:20] <bot-t> wangdoo, Stored "my problem".
[02:28:54] <donCams> i am such a noob. what the hell does this mean {"pages":3} undefined ? that's with console.log btw
[02:28:54] <luaa> bot-t: my problem
[02:28:54] <bot-t> when i use .tagify('serialize').I'm unable to input tags into it.
[02:28:58] <gnarf> bot-t: forget my problem

[02:29:10] <gnarf> wangdoo: please stop talking to the bot
[02:29:31] <wangdoo> gnarf:  why is it so?
[02:29:58] <gnarf> ?bot
[02:29:59] <bot-t> sentient but living in the machine locale.
[02:30:16] <gnarf> wangdoo: probably because its not a person
[02:30:16] <donCams> bot give me coffee
[02:30:29] <wangdoo> bot-t:  nope,it is a person
[02:30:30] <bot-t> wangdoo, Stored "nope,it".

[02:30:43] <bot-t> gnarf, Forgot "nope,it".
[02:31:09] <gnarf> wangdoo: how about don't talk to the bot, or don't talk in #jquery?
[02:31:20] <wangdoo> leave it.some one help me with my problem
[02:31:34] <gnarf> i don't even know what the problem is
[02:31:38] <blackspotwiggins> wangdoo, cool attitude bro
[02:31:42] <gnarf> you've been talking to a bot for the past 10 minutes
[02:31:53] <wangdoo> gnarf: :)
[02:32:24] <wangdoo> gnarf:  help me with this http://projects.alicialiu.net/jquery-tagify-demo/?
[02:32:31] <sean`> donCams, you need to parse that string
[02:32:47] <sean`> donCams, or dataType: 'json'
[02:33:35] <donCams> cool. i added dataType: 'json' earlier but didn't work
[02:33:38] <donCams> now it does... argh
[02:33:40] <donCams> thanks man
[02:33:51] <wangdoo> gnarf:  have you seen the link?
[02:34:02] <gnarf> ?ask
[02:34:02] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:34:41] <donCams> try this on gnarf, he'll fall for it http://lolsnaps.com/news/6649/0/
[02:34:47] <donCams> jk... bye
[02:35:59] <wangdoo> gnarf: To read tags that you have inputted,according to that plug in,you should use this .tagify('serialize'); but when i use this i do not get that text box to input
[02:36:17] <gnarf> ?p @wangdoo
[02:36:18] <bot-t> wangdoo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:38:11] <Deele> I have an ajax request, that sends POST and receives JSON, until I made responses in JSON, everything was ok, now my script does not eaven start success function, is there anything specific to reqPOST+respJSON
[02:38:13] <Deele> ?
[02:38:44] <moo-_-> Deele: no
[02:38:56] <moo-_-> Deele: can you please repeat the problem at jsfiddle.net
[02:39:40] <blackspotwiggins> Deele, there is
[02:39:43] <Deele> mocas__, that is not jsonp, I cant repeat that problem
[02:39:52] <blackspotwiggins> your json must be formatted according to spec
[02:40:05] <blackspotwiggins> if it's not, it fails with parsing error
[02:40:29] <Deele> blackspotwiggins, at least, firebug understands my format
[02:40:43] <blackspotwiggins> does it pass jsonlint?
[02:41:46] <gnarf> Deele: if its not valid json, sucess will never fire
[02:42:34] <Deele> thx for jsonlint
[02:42:39] <Deele> didn't know of such
[02:43:18] <blackspotwiggins> Deele, if you weren't busy handcrafting json
[02:43:22] <blackspotwiggins> you wouldnt even need to use it
[02:43:31] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins++
[02:43:41] <Deele> yes, its valid JSON
[02:44:58] <Deele> blackspotwiggins, not handcrafting json, handcrafting javascript/ajax
[02:45:05] <Deele> blackspotwiggins, http://pastie.org/2338453
[02:46:12] <blackspotwiggins> datatype "json text" ???
[02:46:54] <Deele> yeah, you can stack, if it fails to parse json, it will use it as text
[02:47:05] <gnarf> Deele: you know that means it will parse json and convert it to text right?
[02:47:15] <gnarf> or at least attempt to convert it to text
[02:47:44] <blackspotwiggins> no thats conversion
[02:48:14] <blackspotwiggins> and
[02:48:16] <blackspotwiggins> why the hell
[02:48:23] <blackspotwiggins> would it ever fail in a way
[02:48:29] <blackspotwiggins> that you'd need to use it as text
[02:55:20] <Deele> ok, now it uses success but I guess, i'm referencing to json data in wrong way
[02:55:51] <Deele> this should work, doesn't it? success: function(data){ $('#channel_'+data.channel).append(data.msgHtml); }
[02:56:02] <Deele> for JSON datatype
[02:56:03] <wangdoo> gnarf: :P
[02:58:35] <Deele> blackspotwiggins, are you still able?
[03:00:37] <themachine> I have a form where if you select a certain radio, it will hide/display a div depending on the value of the radio
[03:00:53] <themachine> i updated my script to populate the radio value on load
[03:01:00] <themachine> but the onchange event is not triggering
[03:01:06] <themachine> any ideas on how to go around this?
[03:01:16] <Deele> themachine, jsfiddle.net pastie.org
[03:02:32] <Drummer_si> Hello
[03:02:58] <Deele> hui
[03:02:59] <Deele> hi
[03:03:05] <Drummer_si> I wonder if anyone can help me out with a relatively simple jQuery problem?
[03:03:16] <amit_usual> i have a particular ajax call that is taking a fair amount of time ... is it probable that it may be the reason why the success callback may not be running
[03:03:58] <themachine> Deele: http://pastie.org/2338541
[03:04:09] <Deele> if it is possible, please post your situations in jsfiddle.net or atleast in pastie.org
[03:06:18] <Drummer_si> This is my problem: http://pastie.org/2338552    -- I simply need to know a simple way of finding out which object a particular selector belongs to.
[03:08:01] <Deele> themachine, see http://jsfiddle.net/Deele/HJXw6/ its working, its onload initiated change event
[03:08:20] <ravenzz> ?index Drummer_si
[03:08:21] <bot-t> ravenzz, Couldn't find "index Drummer_si" in jQuery Docs.
[03:08:25] <ravenzz> ?index @ Drummer_si
[03:08:25] <bot-t> Drummer_si, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[03:09:22] <Drummer_si> That's great.. thanks... I'll look into it now
[03:09:36] <Deele> Drummer_si, try using e or this as object, use it as $(this).html()
[03:10:39] <themachine> Deele: I am setting the value of the radio's after the page has loaded, and without the user clicking on it. How can I have it trigger after the values are loaded?
[03:10:41] <plov> hi guys, i made a css submit button, using $.post, my problem is how can i tell which form it's for it can be posted to the right url?
[03:12:00] <Drummer_si> Thanks guys! "index()" fits my needs perfectly and works like a charm! The jQuery docs are great.. I just didn't know exactly what I needed to use.. Thanks for giving up your time in this chat room :)
[03:12:00] <Deele> themachine, does not care when you set values, event is bind to dom element, if you create new dom element, you need to set its events, after it has been loaded, what do you want to trigger?
[03:13:11] <Deele> plov, do you use $('form').submit(function(){ $.post(stuff); }); ?
[03:13:45] <Deele> Drummer_si, yeah, explaining sometimes takes more time than full-time job
[03:13:52] <plov> no, but i'm going to switch to that, i was using div.click then $.post
[03:14:13] <Deele> plov, jsfiddle.net pastie.org <- your code
[03:15:23] <plov> should be fine now that i'm using form.submit
[03:15:32] <themachine> Deele: http://jsfiddle.net/graydot/HJXw6/1/
[03:16:03] <themachine> my script sets values after the dom is ready
[03:16:09] <Deele> and?
[03:16:11] <themachine> I would like it to trigger the change event
[03:16:12] <Deele> what you need to set?
[03:16:27] <Deele> $('[name="opt_faci_deposit"]').change(); ?
[03:17:03] <themachine> that was what I was looking for -_- ty
[03:17:10] <Deele> :)
[03:17:33] <Deele> I would suggest, move that stuff out of event, put it in function
[03:17:46] <Deele> add call to function, when triggered
[03:17:54] <Deele> and add call to function, to do that stuff again
[03:18:09] <themachine> good idea
[03:19:02] <Deele> try to use jquery selectors as few as posible, it will save some bits in RAM
[03:19:20] <Drummer_si> One last thing guys.. I know Javascript doesn't properly support OOP, but anyone know any good tutorials/ resources on how to fake it? and explain how it works?
[03:19:37] <quicksilver> javascript has good OOP support
[03:19:46] <Deele> Drummer_si, is good OOP
[03:19:47] <VeXii> better to look in to the prototype system thou
[03:19:48] <Deele> what do you need?
[03:19:59] <quicksilver> OOP doesn't have to be class based
[03:20:00] <VeXii> saves you some stress :)
[03:20:05] <quicksilver> prototype OO is rather nice actually.
[03:20:16] <quicksilver> although people have written class based frameworks for JS too if you insist.
[03:20:37] <AdTaylor> I'm currently writing a plugin that I want to be pretty small and fast (Yeah, I know that reads pretty dumb) and was wondering what you guys use to test performance?
[03:20:59] <VeXii> http://jsperf.com/
[03:21:08] <Drummer_si> I want to write classes into Javascript to keep my code clean - I just need some good resources to learn more about this - thoguth this would be a good place to ask.
[03:21:33] <VeXii> just make objects and extend on them
[03:21:34] <poppiez> can anyone see why safari makes background images blurry even though the proper zoom image is being loaded? http://www.webdevout.net/test?0D
[03:21:55] <AdTaylor> Drummer_si, I really liked this article http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
[03:22:24] <AdTaylor> and also found required.js great for writing modular code
[03:22:43] <Drummer_si> Thank AdTaylor.. I just need good "beginner" resources to get to gripes with the whole process :)
[03:25:19] <AdTaylor> Drummer_si : Don't knwo if you have seen this, but it gives great indications on how to write nice clean code http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[03:26:48] <Drummer_si> I haven't read anything about plugin architecture on the jQuery site (read a chapter in a book once and followed basic examples)
[03:27:59] <AdTaylor> I only came across it the other day and realised I really was doing it all wrong
[03:32:14] <plov> silly question but how do i go through an order of elements like $(#some_div #some_span).blah
[03:33:00] <VeXii> you can chain it whith a .each() if you wanner loop them
[03:33:28] <VeXii> or w8 i dont think i understand the qustion
[03:33:47] <plov> never mind heh i think my question had it's own answer
[03:35:58] <matjas> AdTaylor: http://jsperf.com/
[03:37:38] <Clorith> I have a one lined jQuery trying to add farbtastic, but it's causing an uncaught type error relating ot property 'fn'
[03:37:42] <Clorith> jQuery.noConflict(document).ready(function($) { $('#farge').farbtastic(); });
[03:40:52] <AdTaylor> matjas : thanks. Is the YUI profiler any use or is it fairly impotent next to dev tools?
[03:42:07] <loveful> Hello there. I'm developing an image preloader but, according to firebug, after the preloading the images are requested again each time they are needed (img/# ~180). This is the code I use to preload the images: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/454649/ What am I missing?
[03:43:59] <blackspotwiggins> loveful, use new Image()
[03:45:00] <loveful> I already tried it, something like this "(new Image()).src = src;" But it seems to be the same :(
[03:45:12] <AdTaylor> loveful : var img = new Image() ; img.src = src;
[03:47:40] <loveful> blackspotwiggins, AdTaylor : I tried it, but it seems to be the same. Some image is still requested to the server. Should I store the new Image() object in an array?
[03:47:43] <blackspotwiggins> actually new Image(url) should work
[03:48:18] <blackspotwiggins> it does the request, later requests will hit cache if previous ones have been completed
[03:48:26] <blackspotwiggins> and server provides caching
[03:52:02] <loveful> blackspotwiggins, new Image(src) does not perform any request to the server :/. But (new Image()).src = src; does.
[03:52:28] <loveful> blackspotwiggins, can I link you the live webpage?
[03:53:22] <blackspotwiggins> loveful, not really
[03:53:24] <blackspotwiggins> a bit busy
[03:53:34] <blackspotwiggins> anyway there are tons of preloaders out there, pick one of them
[03:54:19] <loveful> blackspotwiggins, ok. np
[04:01:12] <qwerty57> i try to to .html(test[1])
[04:01:16] <qwerty57> but because test is multilevel array, there's a jquery error
[04:01:29] <qwerty57> suggestions?
[04:33:03] <hugolp> Hi, Im new to jquery and javascript. I am testing on how to create a dialog but I just cant get it to appear, can anyone check this code: http://pastie.org/2338801
[04:33:12] <geekbuntu> if anyone has time, can you take a look at this - see why the submit's are not returning individual results http://jsfiddle.net/46aJC/4/
[04:37:47] <geekbuntu> hugolp, if it helps - i usually just set a var = to my dialog then call it with a .('open')
[04:38:02] <geekbuntu> ar loginForm = $('#loginForm').dialog({
[04:38:03] <geekbuntu>                         modal: true,
[04:38:06] <geekbuntu> blah
[04:38:17] <geekbuntu> loginForm.dialog('open');
[04:38:40] <gp5st> using the template plugin, and not using {{html body}} as it conflicts with my templating language, how can i template unescaped fields?
[04:38:53] <Krinkle> hugolp: Change this
[04:38:54] <Krinkle>     $(document).ready(setDialog());
[04:38:56] <Krinkle> to this:
[04:38:59] <Krinkle>     $(document).ready( setDialog );
[04:39:01] <Krinkle> without "()"
[04:39:05] <hugolp> geekbuntu: thanks for replying, I copied that from some webpages I have been using as a guide. I will try it but I dont think it will change anything.
[04:39:12] <jetienne> i remember a library doing nice animation/transition of dom elements based tags. like keep only element which are foo and bar, now keep only foo element and do a nice animation between the two. i searched but im unable to find it. anybody remember ?
[04:39:16] <Krinkle> "()" executes a function, you don't want to execute it, you want to pass it to ready()
[04:39:28] <geekbuntu> hugolp, Krinkle just answered too
[04:39:33] <Krinkle> the reason it doesn't work is because that #-id doesn't work yet.
[04:39:39] <hugolp> Krinkle: Im trying it now, but can you explain further?
[04:39:47] <hugolp> ah...
[04:39:47] <geekbuntu> (more experienced than me)
[04:39:54] <Krinkle> Thte element doesn't' exist on the page until the page is ready.
[04:40:17] <Krinkle> You used document).ready correctly, but you accidentally executed it right away instead of waiting for document-ready
[04:41:33] <hugolp> Krinkle: ok, so if I pass the name without the () it waits until the document is ready to execute the function because Im passing the function as a parameter to document.ready. But if I use the () then Im executing the function when javascript reads the line. Did I undertand it correctly?
[04:41:47] <Krinkle> Yes
[04:42:23] <hugolp> Krinkle: ok, and should that give an error or something since document.ready is not getting any parameter? (Im a C programmer trying javascript for first time)
[04:43:06] <Krinkle> JavaScript in general is less error-y. In this case you're simply passing the return value of setDialog() to ready()
[04:43:20] <Krinkle> which isn't completely invalid, just not what you wanted.
[04:43:33] <hugolp> ahh.. I see. Thanks a lot.
[04:43:51] <Krinkle> hugolp: are you familiar with 'passing by reference' ?
[04:44:01] <hugolp> Krinkle: yes
[04:44:34] <hugolp> I mean, I know how it works in C, I dont know much javascript yet
[04:45:00] <Armante> Hi, guys i had a question about the jQuery UI datePicker() widget. It seems to automatically select the current day automatically firing the onSelect() event automatically.
[04:45:01] <Krinkle> hugolp: In JavaScript, related to that, there's two things to keep in mind. 1) All objects are passed by reference in JavaScript, always. 2) Many things are objects
[04:46:27] <Krinkle> 2b) An array (wether created through a literal [1,2,3] or as new Array()) inherits from the Object constructor. A function also inherits from the Object constructor.
[04:49:04] <geekbuntu> if i have an invoice with multiple lines, each giving the option to comment on a line, how can i bind the submit to the individual comment?
[04:50:37] <hugolp> Krinkle:  so you mean that arrays and functions are objects in javascript? Btw, its working fine now, thanks.
[04:51:02] <Krinkle> hugolp: Are you familiar with PHP classes ?
[04:51:27] <Krinkle> (ie. a class that extends another class, maybe in C as well, I don't know)
[04:51:51] <hugolp> One more thing, Ive set up the dialog modal and it "works". When I click on a link or something it wont happen anything, but they will still change color and the cursor will change. Its ugly because it seems you can still interact with it. Is there a way to change this?
[04:52:03] <Krinkle> In JavaScript there are no classes, but there are constructors. The Array and Function constructors extend/inherit from the Object constructors.
[04:52:11] <hugolp> Krinkle: I dont know PHP, but I know python
[04:52:15] <hugolp> C is not object oriented
[04:54:56] <Armante> I had a question about the jQuery UI datePicker() widget. It seems to automatically select the current day thus firing the onSelect() event automatically as well. How do i prevent datePicker from auto firing onSelect() on load? Anyone?
[04:55:50] <Hemebond> How difficult is it to return a value from a function that does an (synchronous) AJAX call?
[04:56:06] <Hemebond> It looks like the whole thing want to be async, so I'm not sure how to do it.
[04:57:13] <mr[dot]dr0id> James Bond
[04:58:00] <Hemebond> Ah. Callback function.
[04:58:09] <Hemebond> mr[dot]dr0id: :-)
[04:58:34] <Hemebond> Wait. A callback won't work for me.
[05:09:26] <Armante> I had a question about the jQuery UI datePicker() widget. It seems to automatically select the current day thus firing the onSelect() event automatically as well. How do i prevent datePicker from auto firing onSelect() on load? Anyone?
[05:11:49] <AxonetBE1> hello
[05:12:25] <jesteracer> hello, can someone advise a best crossbrowser way to get scrollbar size?
[05:12:58] <AxonetBE1> How can I hide all the .field when clicking on #address_copy_billing_address  http://pastie.org/2338956
[05:13:35] <somebody__> theme twilight, srsly? :)
[05:14:53] <somebody__> AxonetBE1, $('#address_copy_billing_address ').click(function(){ $('.field').each(function(){$(this).hide();})}); untested
[05:15:26] <Hemebond> jesteracer: Do you mean the width of the window scrollbars?
[05:15:57] <jesteracer> Hemebond: yes
[05:16:11] <Hemebond> jesteracer: No idea.
[05:16:16] <jesteracer> %)
[05:16:21] <Hemebond> jesteracer: You might be able to calculate it.
[05:16:22] <blup> i'm building a couchapp with backbone and i was considering using jquery mobile, but it seems a bit overkill... besides the theme and ajax utilities, what else does it offer that i can't do with zepto?
[05:16:39] <Hemebond> jesteracer: Probably better to rethink what you are trying to do.
[05:17:15] <Hemebond> blup: jQuery Mobile has some limitations. I decided against it.
[05:17:28] <jesteracer> Hemebond: i nead to change html attrs for overflow:hidden and add a margin-right that is scrollbars width
[05:17:49] <jesteracer> to make an overlay, that can be scrolled independant
[05:17:50] <Ankabout> Hi, I'm using a slidedown function for a news page, and it's jumping at the last 20 pixels or so. I can't seem to find why, can anyone advice me?
[05:18:30] <Hemebond> jesteracer: I don't get it. If you want an overlay that can be scrolled, let it scroll. I don't get it.
[05:19:04] <blup> Hemebond: which limitations held you back?
[05:19:06] <jesteracer> i get two scrolls if the overlay is big
[05:19:59] <Hemebond> blup: It's still early in development. Doesn't work very well for dynamic pages (creating pages through script). Documentation is SPARSE.
[05:21:53] <blup> Hemebond: thing is, my app is a single page app, and all content is dynamic (fetched with backbone/couch). which is why i'm wondering if i should use jquery mobile at all.
[05:22:17] <Hemebond> blup: I recommend against using jQuery Mobile.
[05:22:34] <Hemebond> jesteracer: Scrollbars where? On the main window or in your overlay?
[05:22:44] <Hemebond> blup: At least as it is now.
[05:23:03] <blup> Hemebond: ok, thanks. anything i should add to the stack along with zepto?
[05:23:09] <Hemebond> blup: It has been made with static websites in mind.
[05:23:25] <Hemebond> blup: I don't know what zepto is. I'm only using jQuery and jQueryUI.
[05:23:40] <Hemebond> blup: And I'm making a web app for my iPhone.
[05:23:50] <blup> Hemebond: with phonegap?
[05:24:09] <webe> Can anyone please help me with an ie7 issue? http://www.jurbank.com/lightning-grader - the issue appears under the pricing link-the + and - signs are shifted down.
[05:24:17] <Hemebond> blup: No, just a web page. I don't need it to be a native app at all.
[05:24:33] <blup> Hemebond: and zepto is just a lightweight jquery, targetted for mobile. 2k in all.
[05:24:50] <Hemebond> blup: Oh? I might have a look at that.
[05:24:56] <jeandur> hi guys
[05:25:02] <jesteracer> Hemebond main scrollbar for html element
[05:25:07] <blup> Hemebond: http://zeptojs.com/
[05:25:29] <Hemebond> jesteracer: And it's not a problem with your CSS?
[05:25:57] <austen> Does anyone here have decent experience with ui-multidraggable-1.8.8?
[05:26:17] <jeandur> I need some advice about the correct handling of jquery ui modal with a form
[05:26:22] <jesteracer> Hemebond the problem is that a scrollbar is differnt in browsers, in chrom its 15 px, but in latest safari its 0 px)
[05:27:13] <Hemebond> jesteracer: Yeah, that's why it's best to not try and figure out what the user agent looks like, and just use CSS to fit your content into whatever square you're given.
[05:28:06] <jeffsmykil> What is the best way to stop a ajax request until the first one has finished?  boolean operator?
[05:28:19] <jeffsmykil> or is there some built in jquery specific magic
[05:28:23] <Hemebond> jeffsmykil: async?
[05:28:26] * jeffsmykil hopes for magic
[05:28:36] <jeffsmykil> Hemebond: yeah
[05:28:37] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, no builtin magic
[05:28:40] <blackspotwiggins> there is a plugin for that
[05:28:50] <jeffsmykil> can't use pluguins
[05:28:54] <jeffsmykil> unfortunately
[05:29:00] <Hemebond> jeffsmykil: Sorry, that's the option. async:false on an ajax call makes it synchronous.
[05:29:13] <blackspotwiggins> Hemebond, thats a pretty shitty advice
[05:29:21] <Hemebond> jeffsmykil: I think you can also queue ajax calls using jQuery. Search for "queue".
[05:29:25] <jeffsmykil> Ive tried to use a boolean but it loads anyways
[05:29:26] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, http://www.protofunc.com/scripts/jquery/ajaxManager/
[05:29:41] <jesteracer> Hemebond, thanx for advise)
[05:29:53] <austinbv> jeffsmykil: you could just have the 2nd call on a success
[05:30:00] <jeffsmykil> hell even disabling a button until the load comes back
[05:30:18] <jeffsmykil> austinbv: it's the same call
[05:30:21] <Hemebond> blackspotwiggins: aaww
[05:30:22] <jeffsmykil> just with a different date
[05:30:31] <jeffsmykil> with a forward back button
[05:32:08] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  You were helping me on this one http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/27/.Now,after enter data and press enter,it should remove textarea and show only the data
[05:34:05] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Isn't that what happens when you tagify the textarea?
[05:34:29] <kholerabbi> Hi I'm looking for a sticky nav solution that accounts for itself by not obscuring internal links
[05:34:46] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  but i'm doing it on record.after inputting,it has to come back to original form as record,right
[05:35:44] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  How can we do this?
[05:36:52] <Hemebond> wangdoo: The textarea needs to stay there. Are you talking about converting existing cells into a tagify textarea?
[05:37:09] <kholerabbi> So there are a lot of sticky nav solutions (where the nav bar, or any element, sticks to the window frame)...
[05:37:15] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  converting textarea into cell
[05:37:15] <blackspotwiggins> Hemebond, srsly async:false is pretty bad for everything
[05:37:32] <Hemebond> blackspotwiggins: aw, I'm using it :-(
[05:37:41] <wangdoo> Hemebond: after entering the tags, it should convert into cell
[05:37:48] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Why?
[05:38:08] <kholerabbi> but my nav uses internal links, and when the links are clicked and the window scrolls to the header the header is obscured...
[05:38:37] <wangdoo> Hemebond: Remember,you're i/p to cell,you can not leave it as a text area
[05:38:39] <wangdoo> Hemebond: It was a cell,after i/p,it has to come back to original form
[05:39:01] <[E]sc> i have a jquery function which works fine alone, but when i put it with other things, it causes some problems, is there a way to debug this?
[05:39:28] <Hemebond> wangdoo: It shouldn't start as a cell, it should start as a textarea.
[05:40:01] <wangdoo> Hemebond: yes,m taking after you enter tags then it should go back as cel
[05:40:08] <wangdoo> Hemebond: Is it clear now?
[05:40:41] <Hemebond> wangdoo: "go back as cel" it should start as a textarea and stay as a textarea.
[05:40:51] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Why do you want it to change to a cell?
[05:41:39] <wangdoo> Hemebond: You can n't leave it a s text area ,after you enter tags.press enter should save them to db
[05:42:37] <wangdoo> Hemebond: That is how i need t do.Pls,help with my requirement
[05:42:44] <Hemebond> wangdoo: tagify has a method to serialize so you can send it off to the server.
[05:42:58] <Hemebond> wangdoo: I am still learning jQuery.
[05:43:08] <wangdoo> Hemebond: but also i have to send them and bring back to cell
[05:43:14] <wangdoo> Hemebond: Even me
[05:43:47] <wangdoo> Hemebond: What is the conclusion?
[05:44:13] <wangdoo> Hemebond:Do ou know how to do that?
[05:44:58] <austen> I'm using ui-multidraggable. Previously when using ui-draggable I had a stop callback function to record the x and y position of the dragged element. However, now with multidraggable this doesn't seem to be working properly. When I zoom my canvas (part of my application I'm currently implementing) the positioned elements "jump" to some other coordinates. Anybody have any insights as to how multidraggable affects element positioning that
[05:44:59] <austen>  might cause this problem?
[05:45:10] <Hemebond> wangdoo: I don't know how to do that. I haven't used tagify. Sorry.
[05:46:27] <wangdoo> Hemebond: okay.Thanks for helping me.
[05:46:36] <Hemebond> wangdoo: You need to read http://projects.alicialiu.net/jquery-tagify-demo/ and serialize the tags, remove the textarea, then place the tags, as a string, into the cell.
[05:47:15] <wangdoo> Hemebond: But do not know how to convert that textarea into cell
[05:47:31] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Your textarea is in a cell.
[05:47:41] <wangdoo> Hemebond: yes
[05:47:56] <Hemebond> wangdoo: So you don't need to convert the textarea to a cell.
[05:48:14] <wangdoo> Hemebond: What should i do?
[05:48:35] <Sprintfox> What's up guys
[05:48:40] <Hemebond> wangdoo: What I said before. Serialize, remove textarea, set cell text to serialized tags.
[05:48:40] <Sprintfox> < xtridence
[05:48:40] <Sprintfox> :>
[05:49:31] <lahabana> Hey guys think I've found a bug on Jquery UI's buttonset()
[05:49:53] <lahabana> it would be due to unescape id's
[05:50:39] <wangdoo> Hemebond: serialize is done but how to remove text area
[05:50:52] <lahabana> cause I've got an ID radio::input and it does "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [for=element::input]"
[05:51:09] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Use jQuery to delete it. Search for "delete child element".
[05:51:10] <lahabana> and if I remove the "::" it works perfectly well
[05:51:32] <lahabana> *element::input is the ID not radio::input
[05:51:47] <lahabana> anyone has got a guess?
[05:54:14] <lahabana> there must be a $.escape missing somewhere
[05:54:49] <nisseni> how can I check if a jQuery script is executed?
[05:54:59] <lahabana> but I'm not really familiar with Jquery's code...
[05:55:28] <lahabana> nisseni: u can put some trace
[05:55:32] <FinalAngel> I have an element within an overflow:auto, so within that the content is large and shows up a scrollbar. If I add within that frame a click event, it always jumps to top, even with e.preventDefault() anyone any clue why?
[05:55:55] <wangdoo> Hemebond: This is not working  $("<input type='text'>").remove();
[05:55:55] <lahabana> just put console.log("whatever u want") where u want to see if the code is exectued
[05:56:29] <lahabana> nisseni: and then just execute the code and check your browser's console
[05:58:12] <nisseni> lahabana: thing is - it should execute on submit - however, it makes the post rather than validate (like it should)...
[05:58:33] <wangdoo> When i press enter key,how do i remove this textarea  http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/27/
[05:58:55] <lahabana> nisseni: have u e.preventDefault ? so it doesn't post?
[05:59:43] <nisseni> lahabana: not sure - I'm using a php framework plugin.. I'm not soo familiar with jquery to be honest. Where do I put that?
[06:00:31] <lahabana> well u've got a callback on an unsubmit event somewhere in the Js code no ? nisseni
[06:00:38] <seutje> wangdoo: hide/remove on keyup, code = 13
[06:02:20] <Deele> how to use jslint with jquery stuff?
[06:03:04] <nisseni> lahabana: this is the code: http://pastie.org/private/ixjpgsh7faxjiwfjf2iyma
[06:06:19] <lahabana> nisseni: well I think ur code has a few big errors
[06:06:38] <lahabana> do that: http://www.authenticsociety.com/blog/jQueryPluginTutorial_Beginner
[06:06:41] <nisseni> lahabana: ok - it's generated by the plugin :S
[06:07:14] <lahabana> nisseni: ho unlucky ;)
[06:07:29] <VictorCL> hi :)
[06:08:05] <wangdoo> seutje: I tied ,it is not working
[06:08:23] <FinalAngel> when i get the scroll value with $(el).scrollTop(); how do I reapply it?
[06:08:31] <VictorCL> if I have  id="parent_1"... id="parent_2"... id="parent_3" .... etc.. how can I make the select  $("#parent_".xNUM")...    how would the sintax be for xNum
[06:09:13] <lahabana> nisseni: tbh maybe I'm missing something somewhere else in the code but there must be a tiny library somewhere cause I don't think that Jquery has a validate() method...
[06:09:31] <nisseni> lahabana: yeah, there is
[06:09:31] <FinalAngel> ah by passing it, man jquerys docs are so....
[06:09:47] <nisseni> lahabana: this is what I'm using: http://sandbox2.pseudocoder.com/demo/validation
[06:10:39] <lahabana> nisseni: I see what plugin they use
[06:10:43] <quicksilver> VictorCL: $("[id^=parent_]") although it's not exactly what you asked. Better is probably to use a class instead.
[06:11:05] <lahabana> nisseni: there's a debug option if u want
[06:11:16] <nisseni> yeah? how?! :)
[06:11:17] <quicksilver> VictorCL: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[06:11:31] <VictorCL> yeah I am checking http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/
[06:12:00] <lahabana> $(".selector").validate({debug: true})
[06:12:08] <lahabana> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[06:12:51] <wangdoo> seutje:  you there?
[06:13:13] <VictorCL> eq() starts from 0 ?
[06:13:24] <nisseni> lahabana: ok, thanks - does it go before or after I try to execute the script?
[06:13:46] <lahabana> nisseni: insert it before
[06:13:55] <nisseni> lahabana: ok
[06:14:00] <wangdoo> lahabana:  When i press enter key,how do i remove this textarea  http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/27/
[06:14:11] <nisseni> lahabana: and the selector being the field or the button?
[06:14:20] <lahabana> btw ".selector" is ur css selector nisseni
[06:14:31] <lahabana> the form
[06:14:32] <kaputtmacher> hi there
[06:14:36] <nisseni> ah, ok
[06:14:38] <nisseni> thanks
[06:14:53] <kaputtmacher> is there an option for setting the duration of accordion animation from jequery-ui?
[06:15:02] <lahabana> wangdoo: I'm looking
[06:15:28] <wangdoo> lahabana: okay
[06:16:32] <lahabana> wangdoo: I don't really use raw keyboard control on jQuery
[06:16:44] <austen> Figured it out... User error :)
[06:16:52] <wangdoo> lahabana: okay. how to do that?
[06:18:43] <wangdoo> lahabana:  See this http://jsfiddle.net/npe7C/1/.Here if you click on a cell,it ii change into textarea and you can input tags.m done till these.after this pressing enter should remove textarea and  cell should hold the data
[06:20:10] <wangdoo> lahabana: Have you seen my link?
[06:20:46] <lahabana> wangdoo: yes yes wait I'm giving u the code u need

[06:22:11] <neary> Hello
[06:23:03] <neary> in jquery-tmpl, how to wait for an Array to be loaded before jquery calls the $(div).tmpl.(Array..)
[06:23:29] <lahabana> wangdoo: should be something like: http://pastie.org/2339220
[06:23:41] <lahabana> that's not perfect (I don't think it is haven't tested)
[06:23:50] <lahabana> but it's almost that
[06:24:07] <nisseni> lahabana: with this: http://pastie.org/private/tvevtjcy66xhs6mdyneka I get $(".validate_form") is null in the firebug console
[06:24:52] <lahabana> what is the css selector of your form?
[06:25:18] <Armante> I had a question about the jQuery UI datePicker() widget. It seems to automatically select the current day thus firing the onSelect() event automatically as well. How do i prevent datePicker from auto firing onSelect() on load? Anyone?
[06:25:24] <johnathanb> Hey, I have a URL http://mywebsite.com/page/ thne I have a dropdown where someone chooses a "user" and it adds /user/123 (123 being a user id) if they choose another user it should overwrite that one (123) how can I do this?
[06:25:30] <lahabana> has your form has a class called validate_form nisseni ?
[06:25:30] <johnathanb> And sorry for my horrific explanation.
[06:26:17] <nisseni> lahabana: yeah: http://pastie.org/private/pfdcsv7kjwyfnohfzma
[06:27:20] <lahabana> ok soput everything in a $(document).ready(function() {(code here)});
[06:29:10] * jeffsmykil clubs software engineers with a "UI Clue club
[06:30:41] <Engin> I think I've did a very cool inpage uploader, anyone cares to criticize ? http://gettingback.at
[06:31:14] <jeffsmykil> is this one of those pornography websites?
[06:31:35] <snollux> looks like it
[06:31:46] <snollux> shouldn't have clicked it at work
[06:31:49] <jeffsmykil> Engin: I don;'t like your active states for the buttons
[06:31:52] <Sonderblade> in jquery, how can you move items from one select box to another?
[06:32:02] <Engin> jeffsmykil: as in ?
[06:32:13] <jeffsmykil> i think the active states are ugly
[06:32:19] <Segaja> Sonderblade: sounds like a task for jquery ui movable
[06:32:20] <Engin> any suggestions
[06:32:25] <jeffsmykil> change them
[06:32:26] <jeffsmykil> ;)
[06:32:36] <Sonderblade> Segaja: no, thats complicating it :)
[06:32:51] <jeffsmykil> something more subtle
[06:33:06] <Engin> jeffsmykil: and why did you think about pornogprahy
[06:33:09] <Engin> ?
[06:33:17] <Segaja> Sonderblade: you could do it manually. remove it from the first and add it to the second
[06:33:45] <snollux> Engin: what other kind of pictures would you upload to "get back" at an ex girlfriend or boyfriend?
[06:33:53] <snollux> it doesn't make much sense at all otherwise
[06:34:07] <snollux> from the devil thing to the title to the fact that it's just an image upload
[06:34:10] <Engin> it is not about pictures, it is about selling their gifts
[06:34:40] <Sonderblade> Segaja: yeah im trying $("#list option:selected").remove().appendTo("#otherList"), doesn'tw ork
[06:35:01] <Segaja> Sonderblade: anything in the errorconsole of the browser?
[06:35:06] <Engin> i was trying to get input on the uploader though :)
[06:35:26] <jeffsmykil> engin it seems like one of those sites where you upload naked pictures of an ex to get revenge
[06:35:47] <Engin> hehehe
[06:36:03] <Engin> a tempting offer!
[06:36:07] <Sonderblade> Segaja: yes :), im blind sometimes
[06:36:23] <Segaja> Sonderblade: it would interest me what the problem is/was
[06:36:49] <Sonderblade> a stray > character

[07:00:31] <Fox`> i understand some functions have callbacks, but things like width() doesn't
[07:01:11] <Skizu> Hey i've 2 questions
[07:01:22] <sean`> Omg

[07:01:31] <Skizu> 1, how do i do a background image using .css()
[07:01:44] <Ankabout> Hi, I'm using a slidedown function for a news page, and it's jumping at the last 20 pixels or so. I can't seem to find why, can anyone advice me?
[07:01:46] <sean`> .css ('background-image', 'url(../image-here.png');
[07:01:53] <Brodingo> Skizu i would use add/remove class though
[07:01:58] <Skizu> 2, any idea how to get a background image which is huge to fit my super wide screen monitor :)?
[07:02:03] <sean`> but.. ^^ Brodingo is better
[07:02:19] <Skizu> bradingo, ye but i'm using a dynamic bg thing o.o so wouldnt work o.O
[07:02:23] <Brodingo> background-size: 100%
[07:02:36] <Skizu> brodingo didnt work
[07:02:43] <Brodingo> oh
[07:03:12] <Skizu> I tried that and setting height to 100% but it just laughed at me and said no o.o
[07:03:28] <Skizu> (You can test if you want brodingo ?)
[07:03:44] <Brodingo> naw i dont want
[07:04:05] <Skizu> WHY YOU NO HELP?
[07:04:06] <Skizu> D;
[07:04:14] <Brodingo> y u no fiddle
[07:04:22] <Skizu> So ye, how do i change a bg image with .css() o.o
[07:04:38] <Brodingo> sean` answered that already
[07:04:55] <Skizu> Ah ye
[07:05:09] <Skizu> Missed at ) :O!
[07:05:13] <Skizu> Thanks sean
[07:07:06] <phlp> Skizu: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/background.html#t011
[07:08:11] <Skizu> phlp i'm using chrome o.o
[07:08:15] <Skizu> And it didnt work ;)
[07:08:39] <Skizu> But ye it's the height that was wrong not the width
[07:08:58] <phlp> background-size:contain is probably what you want
[07:09:05] <AdTaylor> or background-size: cover
[07:12:57] <kaputtmacher> is it possible to adjust the animation speed of an accordion (jqueryui)
[07:13:10] <kaputtmacher> ?
[07:13:38] <Skizu> adtaylor
[07:13:40] <Skizu> Tried that
[07:13:41] <Skizu> :/
[07:16:45] <AdTaylor> Skizu : if you made a fiddle with all your experiments then it might be easier to help
[07:17:56] <Skizu> AdTaylor >_> you can just go to http://sirrus.co.cc/dynamic and login with your fb o.O takes you to fb so you dont have to bitch - then you've to go to the cog at the top and click background then reload o.o
[07:18:15] <AdTaylor> i'd rather not
[07:19:18] <jeffsmykil> man i need a rubber duck at my desk, but  everyone would think I was crazier for talking to it
[07:19:26] <Skizu> Lol
[07:19:28] <Skizu> Well bye
[07:19:31] <vladyn> hello guys
[07:19:55] <vladyn> how can I create a script element and add just before </head> - closing head tag
[07:19:58] <vladyn> ?
[07:21:02] <__o> $("head").after("<div>boop</div>");
[07:22:01] <sphinxxx> whats an efficient way of creating a box on hover of images (with text that contains the alt of the image)?
[07:22:19] <vladyn> why .after?
[07:22:32] <vladyn> I;ve tried : var Script = document.createElement('script');
[07:22:44] <vladyn> Script.src = "scripts/ex1.js";
[07:22:59] <vladyn> $("head").append(Script)
[07:24:53] <jeffsmykil> how do you search an array for a a variable and find out what index it is at?
[07:25:07] <vladyn> append doesn't work
[07:25:22] <vladyn> some method for injecting in DOM element
[07:25:30] <vladyn> tried add as well
[07:25:30] <tbranyen> jeffsmykil: index

[07:26:15] <jeffsmykil> wiat iirc isnt there an issue with index and ie?
[07:26:33] <daBoOm> hi all
[07:26:50] <daBoOm> is it possible
[07:26:55] <daBoOm> to select a target
[07:27:02] <daBoOm> with attribute rel?
[07:27:15] <jeffsmykil> attr("rel")
[07:27:23] <daBoOm> yes but
[07:27:32] <daBoOm> i dont wanna get the rel value
[07:27:40] <daBoOm> i wanna target something specific instead of the id
[07:27:44] <daBoOm> with the rel attribe
[07:27:48] <daBoOm> attrib*
[07:28:03] <jeffsmykil> so if attr.("rel") == foo { bar}
[07:28:03] <daBoOm> $("#test [rel=’" + v + "’]")
[07:28:09] <jeffsmykil> or that
[07:28:28] <daBoOm> a if clause how shold that work <.<?
[07:28:34] <tbranyen> jeffsmykil: no...
[07:28:48] <tbranyen> jeffsmykil: there is an issue with Array.prototype.indexOf in IE
[07:28:53] <tbranyen> thats not jQuery
[07:29:04] <jeffsmykil> tbranyen: right, that is correct :)
[07:29:24] <jeffsmykil> tbranyen can i find the index of one variable inside of an array?
[07:29:29] <jeffsmykil> trying to follow the doc
[07:29:33] <jeffsmykil> but i have a headache today
[07:29:45] <tbranyen> variables are just values
[07:31:17] <daBoOm> hmm
[07:31:20] <daBoOm> so no idea
[07:31:24] <daBoOm> how i can target quick
[07:31:30] <daBoOm> instead of id a rel attrib?
[07:33:21] <phlp> daBoOm: [rel="foo"] should do it.
[07:33:56] <vladyn> how can I animate Only the opacity of the background image_url without affecting the element's opacity ?
[07:34:14] <phlp> jeffsmykil: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray
[07:34:17] <gp5st> using the template plugin, and not using {{html body}} as it conflicts with my templating language, how can i template unescaped fields?
[07:34:18] <Peeter> How does the document.ready function work on a page thats loaded from the cache? (user pressed the back button @ browser)
[07:35:03] <tswicegood> hello, I'm looking for an example of using a <button> inside an <li> to trigger it's sorting behavior...  anyone happen to have an example of that handy?
[07:35:11] <gp5st> Peeter: sometimes it does weird things.  I think in ie 8 (??) you have to do something with the document unload method. sorry for being vauge. it's just something i heard our designer talk about
[07:35:44] <gp5st> tswicegood: what's the problem you're having?
[07:35:47] <jeffsmykil> thanks phlp
[07:36:27] <vladyn> plug-in?
[07:36:28] <kborchers> vladyn: you can't animate a background image, you have to animate the element that has the background
[07:36:42] <vladyn> hmm
[07:36:46] <vladyn> I see
[07:36:51] <vladyn> plug-in probably
[07:37:04] <tswicegood> gp5st: I have an <ul> that is sortable in jquery-ui, but I want to add a buttonset to it and use one of those buttons as the "handle" for re-ordering...  having a hard time finding how to make a list sortable, but use X element as the handle to trigger the sort-behavior
[07:37:26] <vladyn> " JQuery Can Only Animate Numeric CSS Values"
[07:38:34] <Peeter> gp5st: Could you give me any keywords? (IE8 is the browser im having problems with)
[07:38:35] <gp5st> tswicegood: sorry:( i'm not familar with sorting li's in jquery-ui. there isn't a paramter or call back you can set when initializing the sortable list?
[07:38:58] <kborchers> vladyn: right and background-image is not numeric. if you animate the opacity, it will affect the opacity of the entire element, not just the background
[07:39:03] <gp5st> Peeter: I think you have to set the window.unload method in the body tag. let me ask
[07:39:25] <vladyn> I see
[07:39:34] <vladyn> I think I found some plugin that solves this
[07:40:13] <smartboy> I have the code here http://jsfiddle.net/cg5qL/ which I try to run. It is a simple post call which checks for changes and updates the menu accordingly. Unfortunately, this isn't working, for when i go into the fadeout function, variable i seems to get incremented by one, but i can't see how this is happening. I tried renaming i to count, thinking that there may have been a naming conflict, but it didn't help, same thing happened. Perhaps someone can shed 
[07:40:16] <jeffsmykil> phlp: what am i doing wrong? console.log(shiftID.inArray(shiftIDArray));
[07:40:58] <phlp> jeffsmykil: console.log($.inArray(shiftID, shiftIDArray))
[07:41:28] <jeffsmykil> never seen a $. before
[07:41:40] <tswicegood> gp5st: not that I can find in the docs :-/
[07:42:01] <phlp> not even $.ajax ?
[07:42:16] <jeffsmykil> oh right
[07:42:20] <jeffsmykil> i have seen that before
[07:42:22] <jeffsmykil> i use that
[07:42:25] <phlp> ;)
[07:43:56] <jeffsmykil> strange
[07:44:03] <jeffsmykil> phlp im getting -1's
[07:44:13] <jeffsmykil> my array has 1,2,3,10,11 in it
[07:44:20] <jeffsmykil> and the shiftID is 11
[07:44:25] <jeffsmykil> peculiar it is
[07:44:38] <smartboy> jeffsmykil: inArray is backwards
[07:44:54] <blackspotwiggins> ?demo @ jeffsmykil
[07:44:54] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:44:56] <smartboy> you have to go against logic, and do if !$.inArray() to check if the element is in array
[07:44:59] <phlp> ?js $.inArray(11, [1,2,3,10,11])
[07:44:59] <bot-t> phlp: 4
[07:45:20] <blackspotwiggins> smartboy, no?
[07:45:38] <jeffsmykil> phlp Im receiving no match
[07:45:52] <blackspotwiggins> ?js !$.inArray(1, [1,2,3])
[07:45:52] <smartboy> blackspotwiggins: that worked for me when i was having problems with inArray.
[07:45:52] <bot-t> blackspotwiggins: true
[07:46:20] <blackspotwiggins> ?js !$.inArray(2, [1,2,3])
[07:46:20] <bot-t> blackspotwiggins: false
[07:46:28] <blackspotwiggins> smartboy, clearly 2 is in the array
[07:46:29] <nisseni> the validate-script I've installed has locale files - how do I install/use those? can't find in the docs...
[07:47:16] <jeffsmykil> so why is it reporting false?
[07:47:32] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, type mismatch?
[07:47:36] <blackspotwiggins> provide a demo
[07:47:41] <blackspotwiggins> or the problem is you
[07:47:41] <smartboy> blackspotwiggins: i know, but when i was dealing with last week, it was reporting false if the element was in the array
[07:47:58] <blackspotwiggins> smartboy, so? that means you should give out false info?
[07:48:32] <smartboy> blackspotwiggins: i was giving one solution, one which worked for me.
[07:48:38] <jeffsmykil> blackspotwiggins: like imigth be trying to match integers ?
[07:48:47] <phlp> jeffsmykil: console.log(typeof shiftID)
[07:48:53] <blackspotwiggins> smartboy, wtf
[07:49:10] <blackspotwiggins> smartboy, how could it possibly work
[07:49:27] <jeffsmykil> phlp : number
[07:50:00] <jeffsmykil> well then it comes back as a string
[07:50:36] <jeffsmykil> ok im fiddling this bitch
[07:52:07] <smartboy> blackspotwiggins: i don't know but all i know is that solved it. I had this code: var whitelist = [ 8, 20, 37, 38, 39, 46, 189 ]; if (!jQuery.inArray(8, whitelist)) { console.log(true); } and that output correctly. if i did inArray without the !, it didn't
[07:52:42] <blackspotwiggins> smartboy, thats because it's returning 0
[07:52:50] <blackspotwiggins> and if(0) fails
[07:53:11] <blackspotwiggins> if you dont know how ifs() and/or inarray works dont give out shit advice
[07:53:41] <blackspotwiggins> your example fails for every other number in the array
[07:53:47] <blackspotwiggins> surprised that your code works at all
[07:53:48] <smartboy> blackspotwiggins: exactly. its backwards. it either should return a bool saying if the element is in the array or not or it should return 1 if its in the array, 0 if its not.
[07:54:02] <blackspotwiggins> its not fucking backwards
[07:54:06] <blackspotwiggins> it returns the index
[07:54:13] <blackspotwiggins> or -1 if its not in the array
[07:54:24] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/D5Tjc/, whats wrong with that ?
[07:58:21] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/D5Tjc/
[08:00:17] <strawberrybunny> I've got a bit of a tough problem. Basically, I'm sick of joomla, so I'm going to use jquery to just push these different articles and such around the page. The problem is that a given article isn't contained in a single tag. http://racemd.com/ Is there an easy way to select a range of elements in the tree?
[08:01:10] <Brodingo> Skizu maybe a more complete example would be easier to see where youre going wrong
[08:01:31] <Skizu> brodingo i missed out ); on the end o.o
[08:02:16] <strawberrybunny> from the second h3 to just before the iframe
[08:02:18] <Brodingo> well not just that, the markup, the css, are the classes doing what you expect? is the image url correct that youre trying to reference? is jquery loaded correctly and in a doc ready func?
[08:02:52] <Skizu> I norrowed down the problem to that...
[08:03:10] <Skizu> XD just missed ); >_> damn missing out little but important things :P
[08:03:34] <phlp> strawberrybunny: $('h3').eq(1).nextUntil('iframe')
[08:03:43] <strawberrybunny> neat
[08:03:58] <strawberrybunny> Wait, for the record, this is the second h3 tag
[08:04:22] <phlp> strawberrybunny: yes first would be 0
[08:04:27] <strawberrybunny> ohh
[08:04:34] <strawberrybunny> Yeah, I've got the eq docs open now
[08:06:04] <strawberrybunny> Now. I've got to take the contents of those tags and move them to another place on the page. That query will return something I can throw in a variable and later call html() on right?
[08:08:06] <strawberrybunny> phlp: My plan is to call that query, store the return, and call the query again and .html('') on it to empty the area. Am I wrong in thinking this will work?
[08:08:30] <phlp> strawberrybunny: if you want to move it just do .appendTo('#new-spot')
[08:08:35] <strawberrybunny> oh
[08:08:37] <strawberrybunny> Oh right
[08:08:43] <strawberrybunny> I freaking read about appendTo friday too
[08:08:47] <strawberrybunny> thanks a bunch
[08:08:53] <phlp> np
[08:12:06] <Skizu> Do you need to use success on $.ajax as i'm getting an error with the jquery libs
[08:12:53] <strawberrybunny> Hrm. "An unbalanced tree was written to the document". The tags are balanced in the selection as far as I can tell. I don't get it.
[08:14:38] <globe_tmp> hi
[08:15:03] <globe_tmp> guys i  have a json object like this {"46.967134":"6.305695","47.630231":"4.82254","47.353711":"5.863495"}
[08:16:07] <Skizu> http://sirrus.co.cc/dynamic gives me an error :S ideas ?
[08:16:29] <Rushing> globe_tmp, that seems pretty wierd. not sure if floats are allowed as keys
[08:16:50] <Rushing> i know some wierd characters are, but my guess is that's your problem
[08:17:05] <phlp> they are strings so it shouldnt matter
[08:17:25] <globe_tmp> yeah
[08:17:27] <vladyn> is here a way to animage the opacity of the background image
[08:17:35] <vladyn> sorry for the stupid questions again
[08:17:42] <globe_tmp> but when i try to iterate over them it doesn't work correctly
[08:17:44] <vladyn> but didn;t found anything suitable
[08:17:48] <strawberrybunny> Dang. Narrowing down the selector didn't help. I have no idea why it thinks it's writing an imbalanced tree.
[08:18:17] <globe_tmp> http://pastebin.com/v2Pbi2iY   don't parse correctly
[08:18:31] <Ar-ras> what is the $().ajax equivalent for $().load('ajax/test.html #container');
[08:19:05] <AdTaylor> .animate({
[08:19:05] <AdTaylor>     opacity: 0.25})
[08:19:12] <globe_tmp> Rushing: phlp  any better way to iterate over them
[08:19:26] <erichynds> Ar-ras: from the source: http://erichynds.com/i/ff8514.png
[08:19:36] <Rushing> my firefox is acting up so i've not seen the links yet
[08:20:09] <Skizu> AdTaylor, sean, Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeType' of null what does this mean
[08:20:21] <kborchers> vladyn: i already told you that is not possible. you can only animate the opacity of an element. something you could try is position two elements over each other, place your background image in the element that is behind, then animate that elements opacity
[08:20:24] <phlp> var e = {"46.967134":"6.305695","47.630231":"4.82254","47.353711":"5.863495"}; for (var key in e) { if (e.hasOwnProperty(key)) console.log(key + " -> " + e[key]); }
[08:20:35] <phlp> ?js var e = {"46.967134":"6.305695","47.630231":"4.82254","47.353711":"5.863495"}; for (var key in e) { if (e.hasOwnProperty(key)) console.log(key + " -> " + e[key]); }
[08:20:36] <bot-t> phlp: "46.967134 -> 6.305695""47.630231 -> 4.82254""47.353711 -> 5.863495"
[08:20:40] <phlp> seems to work
[08:21:15] <Rushing> globe_tmp, the far var in x interator makes that hasOwnProperty condition unecessary
[08:21:36] <vladyn> member:kborchers - thats I'm going to do
[08:21:37] <Rushing> what you're doing is fine though. you could also do $.each(elementsLimitesJSON, function(key, val){ ... });
[08:21:38] <Skizu> define: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeType' of null, http://sirrus.co.cc/dynamic
[08:21:49] <vladyn> to animate the background position numbers
[08:22:16] <gnarf> Rushing: untrueish... if someone has messed with the prototype of Object, those keys show up too
[08:22:33] <strawberrybunny> phlp: figured out the problem
[08:22:41] <strawberrybunny> the query is not quite right
[08:22:55] <gnarf> ?js Object.prototype.dontEverDoThis = true; var a = {}; for (var idx in a) { console.log( idx, a.hasOwnProperty( idx ) ); }
[08:22:56] <bot-t> gnarf: "dontEverDoThis" false
[08:23:02] <Rushing> ah true gnarf...don't really ever include anything that does that lol
[08:23:20] <Skizu> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeType' of null, http://sirrus.co.cc/dynamic, what am i doing wrong?
[08:23:53] <globe_tmp> Rushing: phlp ok thanks guys

[08:24:24] <jeffsmykil> argh
[08:24:28] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/rWcQA/10/
[08:26:33] <strawberrybunny> phlp: That query is exclusive to the h3 tag. It grabs everything but.
[08:26:46] <strawberrybunny> :<
[08:27:39] <phlp> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/rWcQA/12
[08:28:37] <jeffsmykil> phllp i see
[08:28:48] <jeffsmykil> i will try this
[08:28:55] <phlp> strawberrybunny: jQuery('h3').last().nextUntil('iframe')
[08:29:04] <strawberrybunny> hm
[08:29:08] * Skizu wonders if anyone can help
[08:30:03] <kborchers> strawberrybunny: so you're saying you want the h3 as well?
[08:30:13] <phlp> jeffsmykil: that is an array of strings though not numbers
[08:30:46] <jeffsmykil> phlp: the issue is they start out as numbers with mine
[08:30:49] <jeffsmykil> then change to strings
[08:31:30] <kborchers> strawberrybunny: $('h3').eq(1).nextUntil('iframe').andSelf();
[08:32:25] <phlp> jeffsmykil: are you adding to the array? if you are adding the .val then you need to use parseInt(str,10)
[08:33:40] <Cros79> hey, why doesn't this prevent the click on the link?
[08:33:40] <Cros79> http://jsfiddle.net/cros/BEpmr/4/
[08:34:04] <strawberrybunny> kborchers: Yeah. I want the h3 up to but excluding the iframe
[08:34:12] <strawberrybunny> and andSelf() looks like the trick
[08:34:27] <phlp> Cros79: $('#hlkJQuery')
[08:34:28] <ajpiano> Cros79: you need a #
[08:34:36] <Cros79> man, bad mistake :)
[08:34:41] <Cros79> thanks
[08:35:30] <jeffsmykil> phlp the array gets added to on document ready
[08:36:36] <phlp> jeffsmykil: are you adding to it like you did in the fiddle? because you are adding strings not numbers
[08:36:56] <jeffsmykil> no not exactly
[08:37:09] <jeffsmykil> but i t hink console.log($.inArray(parseInt(shiftID), shiftIDArray));
[08:37:12] <jeffsmykil> might do the trick
[08:38:23] <phlp> parseInt(shiftID,10)
[08:39:02] <globe_tmp> Rushing: phlp  guys this code : jQuery.each(elementsLimitesJSON, function(key, val){ 		   console.log(key + " -> " + elementsLimitesJSON[key]); 	   });
[08:39:15] <globe_tmp> Rushing: phlp  result are : http://pastebin.com/W1UFfP3S

[08:40:40] <MariusKarthaus> Hi, I have a textarea and I want to hover a div at the caret location upon a specific keypress.

[08:42:50] <joikus> you guys, is there a way to detect if a user has returned from being AFK on the browser
[08:43:56] <DofLeFou> Greetings
[08:44:30] <DofLeFou> Is there a way to do the following in JQuery …. window.location = self.location
[08:44:30] <strawberrybunny> joikus: you could try to monitor keyboard/mouse events and keep a timer
[08:44:36] <strawberrybunny> but I think that would be brittle
[08:44:56] <joikus> also, needed if for say.. safari browser on iOS for example
[08:44:57] <strawberrybunny> I don't know if the browser would let you track that in other windows or if the user switches to another tab
[08:45:09] <DofLeFou> I m using a table pagination plugin …. but while i need to refresh my table after a save or edit
[08:45:31] <waerloga> checking for AFKness on iOS would be more difficult as they don't have a mouse per-se
[08:45:32] <DofLeFou> window.location = self.location .. causes to my whole page to reload
[08:46:05] <waerloga> so yeah, it'd be brittle, but that's about the only way I can think that'd work
[08:46:09] <Swannie> Hello
[08:46:17] <Skizu> $('body').removeClass('imgbg'); isnt working for me?
[08:47:13] <strawberrybunny> http://racemd.com/ So I've got this page. The selector works perfectly when I use remove() but when I try to use prependTo(), it says there's an unbalanced tree being written, which makes no sense, because I've counted the tags and they're definitely balanced.
[08:47:29] <strawberrybunny> Do I need to wrap it in a div or something?
[08:47:35] <strawberrybunny> before trying to insert it?
[08:47:40] <strawberrybunny> I'm highly confused
[08:48:07] <kborchers> strawberrybunny: after you remove() something it is gone and can't be prepended. just do prependTo() and it will move it
[08:48:09] <Swannie> If I'm querying a JSON API, and in each paginated response, it implements a "next_page_url", and there may be a LOT of pages - is there a concern about stack depth?
[08:48:20] <strawberrybunny> kborchers: No, prependTo() fails
[08:48:28] <strawberrybunny> I used remove() as a test to see if the selector works
[08:48:29] <joikus> i see ok
[08:48:33] <strawberrybunny> I don't use them at the same time
[08:49:06] <kborchers> ?demo @ strawberrybunny
[08:49:41] <kborchers> bot-t: you're here so wake up!
[08:50:24] <kborchers> strawberrybunny: it would really help to see a fiddle or your broken code somewhere
[08:50:30] <strawberrybunny> http://racemd.com/
[08:50:45] <strawberrybunny> the jquery I'm working with is the last <script> tag in the head
[08:51:55] <kborchers> strawberrybunny: i don't see an element with middle_section as a class anywhere on that page so there is nothing for it to prepend to
[08:52:01] <strawberrybunny> er
[08:52:09] <strawberrybunny> oh
[08:52:10] <strawberrybunny> my
[08:52:11] <strawberrybunny> god
[08:52:27] <strawberrybunny> I can't believe I"ve been that stupid
[08:52:41] <kborchers> it happens ;) get some more coffee
[08:52:48] <Skizu> Can you add a class to body o.o?
[08:52:56] <adamgoucher> if I'm trying to pass in a selector to Sizzle(), and that selector looks like a[title="Coach's Club"] -- what sort of escaping do i need to do wrt the ' in the middle?
[08:54:56] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/sGdxQ/
[08:55:13] <phlp> adamgoucher: $('a[title="Coach\'s Club"]')
[08:56:21] <adamgoucher> thanks. now to see why selenium is misbehaving in this
[08:56:32] <Skizu> phlp why wont you help me :/
[08:56:40] <adamgoucher> (i was afraid that was the answer)
[08:56:45] <strawberrybunny> Skizu: yes, you can give body a class
[08:57:01] <Skizu> strawberrybunny then why cant i remove it :'(
[08:57:10] <strawberrybunny> Good question.
[08:57:11] <Skizu> http://sirrus.co.cc/dynamic
[08:57:20] <Skizu> I then try to remove it and NOTHING happens o.o
[08:58:13] <Skizu> Ideas :/?
[08:58:42] <phlp> Skizu: delay only works for animations
[08:59:32] <Skizu> ph1p then remove  the delay o.o
[08:59:40] <Skizu> I wasnt using that in my code just wanted to delay the change xD
[08:59:53] <DofLeFou> is there a way to refresh a table in JQuery .. without having to reload the page
[09:00:17] <phlp> Skizu: i did and it works as expected. you cant see it happen because you add then immediately remove the class
[09:01:01] <Skizu> ph1p
[09:01:23] <Skizu> If i do javascript:$('body').removeClass('imgbg'); nothing changes :/
[09:02:42] <globe_tmp> when i loop over json object can i select the second  elements for example
[09:02:44] <Skizu> http://sirrus.co.cc/dynamic you've to add it first which works fine but removing it... doesnt work
[09:03:03] <phlp> Skizu: http://jsfiddle.net/sGdxQ/4
[09:08:18] <Skizu> Well then i'm doing this wrong ...
[09:08:35] <orplac> quick question: so i want to insert a div after my header class. the div is the return data from an the ajax .get function. currently my code is $('data').insertAfter(".notificationQuickViewHeader")
[09:08:46] <orplac> but it doesnt insert at all
[09:08:55] <orplac> the data is returning correct n stuff also
[09:10:12] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/tzMES/1/
[09:10:20] <phlp> orplac: is that exactly what you have? try $(data)
[09:10:23] <Skizu> ph1p, why doesnt that work ?
[09:12:02] <orplac> phlp: nice! thanks, i thought i did that before and it didnt work... oh well :P thanks man
[09:12:06] <Skizu> Well i've to go
[09:12:08] <Skizu> Thanks for nothing -.-
[09:14:14] <phlp> Skizu: your response is missing a ); on the end
[09:14:47] <phlp> Skizu: from http://sirrus.co.cc/settings?bg=change
[09:20:38] <sphinxxx> how can i combine 'this' with div:first-child
[09:20:41] <sphinxxx> in a selector
[09:20:50] <sphinxxx> if i'm in a mouseover event
[09:22:12] <geekbuntu> is anyone able to tell why everything on this form is picked up except for the comment box? http://173.255.231.216/php/quotes/test.php
[09:22:26] <kggle> sphinxxx, $('div:first-child', this).....
[09:22:42] <austen> So, I'm selecting a bunch of <div>'s in a document and applying an .each() callback to them. Within the callback, I want to select the children elements of that div and apply an .each() callback to them, and so on until I reach the end of the tree.
[09:22:52] <austen> How can I do the subsequent selections?
[09:24:24] <sphinxxx> kggle that keeps giving me a blank array
[09:24:28] <sphinxxx> when i console log it
[09:25:01] <austen> wait...
[09:25:28] <austen> I think I got it...
[09:25:31] <sasori> hi, i took this example from w3schools http://jsfiddle.net/yhBsp/  i don't understand why this thing has "+" symbol at the 1st,2nd and 3rd line :|
[09:25:47] <sasori> can someone tell me why?
[09:26:31] <AdTaylor> Does anyone use any tools/practices during plugin development to ensure that their plugin is efficient and not sluggish etc?
[09:26:34] <phlp> sasori: it's appending the strings together
[09:27:25] <sasori> you mean to say, it won't work at all w/o that "+"symbol at the end ?
[09:27:37] <sasori> even if it was enclosed with single  quotes ?
[09:28:05] <phlp> sasori: if it was on a single line it would
[09:28:31] <sasori> i see, so json is sensitive then, thanks for the info :)
[09:29:03] <phlp> sasori: no that is a string.. not exactly json
[09:29:28] <sasori> oh ok
[09:30:04] <phlp> sasori: http://jsfiddle.net/yhBsp/1
[09:30:07] <pilgrim> Is there an obvious reason why the for loop works here but not the .prevAll()? http://jsfiddle.net/Xqfnv/
[09:30:26] <pilgrim> .prevAll() doesn't seem to match anything
[09:31:04] <sasori> awesome, thanks for the snippet phlp :)
[09:31:12] <phlp> :)
[09:31:44] <phlp> geekbuntu: the id for the textarea has _comment on the end
[09:32:01] <phlp> nm that is the div
[09:32:12] <phlp> but the a and textarea have the same id
[09:32:20] <geekbuntu> phlp, you think that's it?
[09:32:29] <geekbuntu> i did this a long while ago -b ut haven't used it since
[09:32:31] <geekbuntu> o.0
[09:33:00] <phlp> ids should be unique
[09:33:18] <geekbuntu> i took it out - still returns as undefined
[09:33:29] <geekbuntu> (thanks for looking at it - any ideas area appreciated)
[09:33:40] <DofLeFou> Is Jquery God arround?
[09:34:17] <DofLeFou> How could one refresh a table content in JQuery … without causing a page reload
[09:34:50] <tbranyen> i am god, sup?
[09:34:55] <phlp> geekbuntu: did you update the link? i still see multiple things with that id
[09:35:25] <DofLeFou> tbranyen: I Have a table
[09:35:37] <vladikoff> tbranyen, y u no JohnResig?
[09:35:57] <DofLeFou> which i m trying to refresh its content … without causing the page to reload
[09:36:00] <geekbuntu> http://paste2.org/p/1572404 phlp
[09:36:01] <tbranyen> vladikoff: i am actually on the same level as
[09:36:05] <geekbuntu> that's what i ahve atm
[09:36:24] <tbranyen> DofLeFou: where does the new data come from?
[09:36:35] <tbranyen> DofLeFou: the same page?
[09:36:39] <DofLeFou> yes
[09:36:55] <geekbuntu> phlp, i see one thing you said "_comment" but it;s on the div above the form -w ill take it out too
[09:36:58] <DofLeFou> I tried window.location = self.location
[09:37:00] <tbranyen> you can try and do $("#myTable").load("/path/to/this/page #myTable");
[09:37:08] <tbranyen> ?load @ DofLeFou
[09:37:19] <tbranyen> oh fuuuu bot-t you were here a minute ago
[09:37:30] <phlp> geekbuntu: the a, textarea, and button all have the same id? only one of them can have it
[09:37:34] <Brodingo> but would that make <table><table>
[09:38:46] <geekbuntu> phlp, hmmm
[09:38:52] * geekbuntu thinks...
[09:39:36] <sphinxxx> if i'm in this event : $("#main .item").live("mouseover mouseout", function(event)
[09:39:47] <sphinxxx> what does 'this' refer to?
[09:40:03] <sphinxxx> or rather, do i refer to it with this or $(this) ?
[09:40:05] <erichynds> the matched element
[09:40:12] <erichynds> from ur selector
[09:40:23] <erichynds> and it depends what you want to do with it
[09:40:36] <sphinxxx> i want to select the div inside the current .item div
[09:40:47] <erichynds> $(this).find("div")
[09:40:48] <sphinxxx> i think i can use first child, b/c there's only one div inside
[09:40:49] <DofLeFou> tbranyen: could be like this $("#myTable").load("this #myTable");
[09:41:18] <sphinxxx> erichynds: is .find efficient?
[09:41:23] <erichynds> yeah bro
[09:41:36] <tbranyen> DofLeFou: no
[09:46:16] <DofLeFou> tbranyen: your solution will not work with my current design
[09:46:43] <geekbuntu> phlp, if i do not put the _comment on the div it does remain unique
[09:46:50] <tbranyen> sorry DofLeFou
[09:50:44] <sphinxxx> do you need the easing plugin to use animations with 'swing'
[09:50:48] <sphinxxx> or is that built-in functionality?
[09:50:56] <gnarf> swing is the default
[09:51:01] <gnarf> i think
[09:52:28] <phlp> geekbuntu: http://i.imgur.com/JlxTE.png
[09:55:28] <atula> anyone here works for freecause.com ?
[09:56:03] <geekbuntu> phlp, it's off the button now - only on link, and on div with _comment
[09:56:06] <geekbuntu> using classes
[09:58:46] <chromate> hello; i want a canvas element to capture all keypress; in some browsers, however, space key auto scrolls the window. is there any easy to turn this feature off through javascript, or to make the canvas element the exclusive recipient of the keypress event?
[09:59:05] <phlp> geekbuntu: ok now it's saying "current id is: comment_submit" then you add a # on the front, which finds the button that was just clicked, not the comment box
[10:01:44] <phlp> geekbuntu: what you really need to do is add a div around the whole template (even the +) with that id, then find what you need relative to that. there is no need for an id on everything
[10:03:21] <austen> jQuery: I LOVE YOU!!
[10:03:45] <b-lew> anyone ever used the Galleria gallery?

[10:16:00] <halcyon1234> jquery ui dialog:  I have an https page that calls ("#dialog").dialog().  For some reason, this is causing a mixed-content error message on IE7. Is this a known issue?

[10:16:35] <semanty> erichynds, how?
[10:16:44] <erichynds> var that = this
[10:17:00] <jeffsmykil> phlp: it was coming with odd results so I tried whichIndex = ($.inArray(parseInt(shiftID), shiftIDArray));
[10:17:07] <phlp> semanty: few slides over http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide31
[10:18:50] <jeffsmykil> phlp: it works, it just throws that error
[10:18:53] <jeffsmykil> which is disconcerting
[10:19:54] <phlp> jeffsmykil: sure it's that line causing the error? use parseInt(shiftID,10)
[10:20:14] <jeffsmykil> what does that do
[10:20:54] <jeffsmykil> phlp: same issue
[10:21:19] <phlp> jeffsmykil: specifies decimal https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[10:21:33] <jeffsmykil> phlp i get the same error
[10:22:12] <jeffsmykil> even when i take the parseint out
[10:22:13] <phlp> make a fiddle?

[10:22:45] <semanty> phlp, erichynds, OK, thanks

[10:24:01] <halcyon1234> ok, looks like it might be a ui.resizable issue, bug 7390.  ui.resizable fetches an external icon or something. Hurray for bugs.jqueryui.com.

[10:26:20] <jeffsmykil> yeah it happens on that line it seems
[10:26:23] <jeffsmykil> from the debugger
[10:30:24] <jeffsmykil> ok

[11:08:46] <Lucas3677> hi guys, I use jquery to switch between tabs on my site. however when a user goes to another link and then clicks the back button, it loads the default tab. What's the proper way to use anchor links with jQuery to load the last viewed tab?
[11:10:44] <halcyon1234> airwork: Try looking into the onChangeMonthYear: function(year, month, inst) callback. Hide the dpDiv by default, and select the date in the call back (year, month, 1), something like that?

[11:16:43] <smartboy> I have the code here http://jsfiddle.net/cg5qL/ which I try to run. It is a simple post call which checks for changes and updates the menu accordingly. Unfortunately, this isn't working, for when i go into the fadeout function, variable i seems to get incremented by one, but i can't see how this is happening. I tried renaming i to count, thinking that there may have been a naming conflict, but it didn't help, same thing happened. Perhaps someone can shed 
[11:20:38] <datlap> I dont know why but this function (which I use to highlight selected tab)  adds  a duplicate tab to my site.

[11:39:20] <chubicle> Hey, can anyone help me with a simple problem? I have a bar chart that I'm duplicating three times. http://jsfiddle.net/BmTRh/ Right now I'm copy and pasting the whole graph itself, creating new divs for each one. Can anyone help me make this look better? Possibly using the append function?
[11:42:54] <Kineticcolor> The party has arrived
[11:43:55] <phlp> chubicle: plot.clone().appendTo('body');
[11:47:11] <interopcop> on jquery 1.6.1, I can't get a simple hide/show funciton to work.  https://gist.github.com/1132408  everything displays properly, but the hidden div never shows.  Also, if you could tell me how to make the link toggle so that it changes to "Hide statistics" and references a hide() function, that would be a plus.
[11:49:16] <necromancer> interopcop: try without the delay (2000), just .show()
[11:49:32] <necromancer> interopcop: also make sure it's actually doing what you say it's doing. check it in firebug to make sure the <div style="display: block">...
[11:50:02] <chubicle> phlp: i'm a little lost. somethings not working there... i think it has to do with the div. i'm not sure tho
[11:50:36] <interopcop> necromancer: I actually have display:none
[11:50:48] <interopcop> I thought that's how it got hidden by default
[11:51:01] <necromancer> interopcop: yeah it should start with display: none and then when you do .show() it will change it to display:block
[11:51:36] <interopcop> oh you mean the dom should change when I click the link?
[11:51:48] <here4thegear> http://pastebin.com/v7a3750P Context Menu plugin. When I right click on the element, I get no context menu (not even the default browser one). Firebug gives no errors. What can I be missing?
[11:54:35] <iateadonut> i'm using jpicker, a plugin for a user to select colors - i need to change the image directory.
[11:54:49] <interopcop> necromancer: look like the javascript is not actually attached to the a - it doesn't fire off the function when the link is clicked
[11:54:53] <iateadonut> it's called like this: $('#colorpickerField2').jPicker();
[11:55:21] <phlp> interopcop: http://jsfiddle.net/QehCK
[11:55:26] <necromancer> interopcop: try doing an alert() inside the .click() action
[11:55:30] <necromancer> to make sure it's actually getting fired
[11:55:36] <necromancer> if not, there's your problem
[11:55:50] <necromancer> try to select the <a> you want in Firebug so you get a good selector first, then insert that into your code
[11:55:54] <iateadonut> and the manual has these lines: jPicker([settings, [commitCallback, [liveCallback, [cancelCallback]]]])   - and ..., images   {     clientPath: '/jPicker/images/', // Path to image files
[11:56:17] <interopcop> phlp your code works.  I'll figure out why mind doesn't :) thanks
[11:57:55] <b-lew> kborchers can you help me out maybe?
[11:58:24] <iateadonut> $('#colorpickerField2').jPicker( images{clientPath:'/lib/jPicker/images/'; }); - that's not working for me.
[11:58:27] <iateadonut> i'm wondering what will?
[11:58:57] <djQuery> iateadonut: got a link to jpicker?
[11:59:32] <iateadonut> http://www.digitalmagicpro.com/jPicker/
[11:59:48] <phlp> .jPicker( { images: { clientPath: '/lib/jPicker/images/ }
[11:59:58] <phlp> not what i wanted to do
[12:00:08] <djQuery> iateadonut: options are usualy passed to plugins in the syntax of   .plugin({option1: 'value', option2: ['val', 'a', 'b'])
[12:00:10] <djQuery> etc
[12:00:27] <phlp> .jPicker( { images: { clientPath: '/lib/jPicker/images/' } } );
[12:02:19] <djQuery> its a shame the way that they implimented the callbacks.
[12:03:00] <b-lew> this.listen(thumb.elem, 'hover', this.proxy(function(e) -> is it hover or mouseover? either way isn't working.
[12:03:16] <djQuery> it woulda been much better it they had done something like   .ypicker({select: fucntion(){}, okclick: function(){}}) etc
[12:05:18] <Sprintfox_RO_> Hey guys!
[12:06:20] <djQuery> maybe its time to write my own color picker that uses the $.widget instead
[12:06:59] <phlp> that one was last updated in december
[12:09:50] <necromancer> djQuery: we've been using jQuery UI's colorPicker here, with no problems
[12:09:55] <necromancer> oh wait n/m that's datePicker
[12:09:56] <necromancer> my fault
[12:09:58] <necromancer> i'm an idiot
[12:10:00] <iateadonut> thanks.
[12:10:00] <necromancer> got my pickers confused
[12:10:32] <iateadonut> wouldn't want to pick your nose with your bpicker

[12:24:19] <mfilipe> djQuery, no, I want only clone a match of objects
[12:24:26] <k1t> djQuery: do you freelance
[12:24:32] <k1t> i see you in here a lot
[12:24:39] <mfilipe> I solve the problem with jQuery('.especializacao').first().clone(true).insertBefore('#especializacao-adicionar').find('input').val('');
[12:24:43] <k1t> as a matter of fact, you've helped me several times
[12:25:01] <mfilipe> .find('input').val('') -> this is the secret :)
[12:25:18] <djQuery> k1t: when I can
[12:30:37] <ccmonster> hola folks
[12:31:25] <keyword> anyone can help me
[12:31:40] <interopcop> phlp: ok your code works, mine doesn't  - I have no idea why.  I put your code into production, still no joy:  https://gist.github.com/1132518
[12:32:19] <adtaylor> Is there a way to catch all triggered events with a bind and then call a function from that event name. kind of like : $(el).bind( '*.ns' , function () {  that[ event.type ]( event , data )  } ) ??
[12:32:53] <ccmonster> all events?
[12:33:05] <Skizu_> Hi
[12:33:14] <adtaylor> sorry, all events under a namespace
[12:33:19] <interopcop> I'm using firebug - when I change the dom from display:none to display:block it shows the div I want it to show - so the thing the javascript is supposed to do works fine dom-0wise, but the javascript doesn't seem to be attached to the div
[12:33:19] <ccmonster> hi
[12:33:33] <interopcop> but I don't know how to troubleshoot from there
[12:33:38] <ccmonster> what's your selecter interopcop
[12:33:44] <Skizu_> I've a website but i cant get $('body').removeClass('imgbg'); to work
[12:34:02] <interopcop> is there any way to ask firebug if this script resource reference actually maps to anything in the dom?
[12:34:05] <Skizu_> I tried with ajax request and putting body type to script and just using eval
[12:34:13] <Skizu_> But just wont work, any ideas?
[12:34:19] <Skizu_> Or anyone willing to have a look
[12:34:35] <ccmonster> pastie it
[12:34:44] <ccmonster> both of you ( interopcop and skizu)
[12:34:59] <Skizu_> ccmonster did 100 times before
[12:35:00] <Skizu_> :P
[12:35:01] <interopcop>  https://gist.github.com/1132518
[12:35:56] <ccmonster> i didnt see it, sorry
[12:36:01] <here4thegear> http://pastebin.com/F79nPdHW Context Menu, this just doesn't work. I know it's firing on right click but I'm not getting any context menu at all (default browser or otherwise). I know it's firing because if I add methods that don't exist I get a firebug error but as it is here, I get no error and no context menu
[12:36:31] <ccmonster> hey djQuery , where is the link to the master jquery-ui? I need the newest built version. I am messing with the ui-menu
[12:36:38] <jeffsmykil> whats the correct way to do an ajax refresh on interval so things dont go freaking beszerk?
[12:37:10] <ccmonster> cleartimeout
[12:37:12] <Skizu_> http://sirrus.co.cc/dynamic would be the best way to view
[12:37:12] <ccmonster> set timeout
[12:37:44] <Skizu_> ccmonster: go to http://sirrus.co.cc/dynamic and click the image on the menu bar at the top left
[12:38:23] <jeffsmykil> ccmionster which one?
[12:39:52] <ccmonster> interopcop, you are missing your event handler i think you need a click event for which to 'triggger' the toggle event
[12:40:01] <ccmonster> what you mean which one?
[12:40:39] <ccmonster> unless you've got it triggering in other code, and this is just the hide and show process seperately.
[12:40:43] <Skizu_> ccmonster: think you can help me ?
[12:40:49] <adtaylor> sorry to ask again, but I did a lousy job of it! Can you bind to a namespace like you can unbind to one?
[12:41:26] <bisco77_> does anyone know what happened to jquery-feature-list....i tried going to their website (jqueryglobe.com) and it's a landing page and the plugin seems to be gone
[12:41:32] <jeffsmykil> you said something about clearout ccmonster which i was unfamiliar with
[12:41:48] <ccmonster> settimeout, cleartimeout
[12:42:02] <Skizu_> SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME YOU BASTARDS
[12:42:03] <Skizu_> ^__^
[12:42:24] <ccmonster> no idea bisco77_
[12:42:26] <dp> when using the $().data() function, where does the data actually exist?
[12:42:35] <ccmonster> lol skizu im looking. patience sir
[12:42:40] <ccmonster> on the dom dp
[12:42:42] <ccmonster> read the docs
[12:42:45] <Skizu_> TY someone helping
[12:42:55] <dp> ccmonster: can you point me to where in the DOM?
[12:43:06] <bisco77_> damn...want to use that on the site i'm working on and i can't find anything but that stinking landing page :@
[12:43:26] <djQuery> ccmonster: ui-menu is in the current build you dont need the dev version
[12:43:43] <ccmonster> dp, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[12:43:46] <djQuery> ccmonster: unless u are wanting ui menubar
[12:43:47] <aggrav8d> anyone here have an ipad handy?  I'm seeing a single pixel grey border at the right and bottom of my webpages on an ipad and I don't know why (and I'm still searching!)  Can you please tell me what's causing it so I can kill it?  http://www.kznyblog.com/test/?portfolio=flowers
[12:43:56] <ccmonster> noaXess, regular menu.
[12:44:08] <Skizu_> ccmonster when do i get advice :P
[12:44:12] <dp> ccmonster: I see that. but it doesn't actually show me *where* in the DOM said data gets stored
[12:44:19] <VeXii> Skizu did you check the console?
[12:44:32] <ccmonster> just use your dev tools in the browser, you will see it
[12:44:48] <ccmonster> just view the dom in firebug or whatever, it should be apparent.y
[12:44:49] <Skizu_> What do you mean check the console -.-?
[12:44:53] <Skizu_> I'm getting no errors
[12:44:55] <ccmonster> console.log
[12:44:56] <interopcop> ccmonster: I think the toggle() function adds the click event  automagically
[12:44:58] <Skizu_> It's just doing nothing
[12:45:04] <here4thegear> http://pastebin.com/F79nPdHW Context Menu plug-in when I right click on the element, it blocks the browser context menu but doesn't show me the one I've created. This is all code tied in. I'm getting no errors. What am I doing wrong?
[12:45:09] <ccmonster> Skizu, which image do you want me to look at ?
[12:45:09] <supsup_> question:   are callbacks always a event type in javascript?
[12:45:25] <djQuery> ccmonster: but right on the jquery.com under developer links there is jqueryui git
[12:45:26] <jaysern> is there a jQuery plugin to for a small 1 liner popup text input  box ? such as in Google Calendar's "quick add" ? http://imgur.com/Z6tRO
[12:45:28] <ccmonster> that site is very slow and sluggish, and the slideing down of that toolbar is jittery, and not staying put
[12:45:33] <Skizu_> On the menu
[12:45:38] <Skizu_> There's only 1 image
[12:45:40] <Skizu_> ...
[12:45:57] <ccmonster> the square thing?
[12:46:00] <Skizu_> The one in the anchor with the id ci
[12:46:00] <ccmonster> that brings up a login menu?
[12:46:02] <Skizu_> Yep
[12:46:04] <Skizu_> CLick that
[12:46:12] <Skizu_> Look at the network tab
[12:46:13] <sshaginyan> Is there anyway to do this? http://pastie.org/2340981 I know it's something fundamental I don't understand. I'm new to js
[12:46:34] <ccmonster> look for tooltip jaysern , there are many good plugins to do what you are lookign for
[12:46:43] <Skizu_> You'll see it return $('body').removeClass('imgbg');
[12:46:47] <sshaginyan> I know I'm out of the scope of x
[12:46:56] <ccmonster> hold on skizu, im trying to debug my stuff too.
[12:46:58] <ccmonster> patience please
[12:47:11] <Skizu_> (9hours is patience enough)
[12:47:12] <Skizu_> :(
[12:47:17] <jaysern> ccmonster: a tooltip that serves up an inputbox ?
[12:47:17] <sshaginyan> might have to do with clusters
[12:47:33] <ccmonster> jaysern, sure. Or use jquery ui modal/dialogs
[12:47:52] <djQuery> jaysern: a lot of tooltips can render any html
[12:47:56] <ccmonster> are you trying to return the whole body html minus a class?
[12:48:05] <VeXii> sshaginyan: pack all of it in a $(function(){
[12:48:07] <maqr> is it valid to have multiple ajaxPrefilter calls?
[12:48:15] <jaysern> ah
[12:48:16] <dp> ccmonster: I'm still not seeing it. if you could help me narrow it down some more, that would be great
[12:48:19] <jaysern> makes sense
[12:48:25] <jaysern> thanks ill check
[12:49:12] <sshaginyan> VeXii: that;s the point I don't want to do that
[12:49:26] <sshaginyan> VeXii: How do I pass it as a parameter
[12:49:31] <VeXii> you need to for the binding
[12:49:37] <Skizu_> ccmonster i just want to remove the class imgbg from <body>
[12:49:55] <ccmonster> dp, that toggle effect is a hide and show + whatever you want it to do. However it needs to be triggered.
[12:50:11] <sshaginyan> VeXii: I can't just prototype it in their?
[12:50:14] <SumSigma> hey I am playing with some MegaMenu code and trying to figure out how to modify it to close the megamenu onClick.  Is it possible with this code snippet?  http://pastebin.com/AxMhwUFu
[12:50:17] <VeXii> Skizu_ youre running it of the ajax response
[12:50:19] <dp> ccmonster: I'm talking about the $().data() stuff. I don't see the values anywhere in the dom
[12:50:22] <ccmonster> toggles could be triggered by all sorts of events, not just clicks. Could be chane, hashchange, focus, blur etc..
[12:50:40] <Skizu_> the $('body').addClass('imgbg'); works and $('body').removeCass('imgbg'); just does nothing
[12:50:46] <VeXii> sshaginyan you need to add the click binding after the Dom loadet
[12:50:54] <ccmonster> console.log it out skizu
[12:51:11] <ccmonster> console.log($('body').addClass('imgbg'));
[12:51:12] <Brodingo> did you copy that Skizu_  cause it says removeCass
[12:51:15] <interopcop> ccmonster: http://jsfiddle.net/QehCK/2/
[12:51:21] <ccmonster> then console.log($('body').removeClass('imgbg'));
[12:51:24] <jeffsmykil> i feel like when i set timeout i should be stopping the last set time out
[12:51:32] <jeffsmykil> it loads everything a billion times
[12:51:34] <interopcop> I'm nt saying I know how oit works, that's what phlp gave me a half an hour ago
[12:51:40] <Skizu_> It's remove class on the thing brodingo
[12:51:43] <ccmonster> mix a settimeout with a clear timeout
[12:51:44] <Skizu_> Have a look yourself
[12:51:51] <Skizu_> I removed the login requirements
[12:51:55] <ccmonster> google for the method of 'delaying alax calls' or something of that nature
[12:51:55] <Skizu_> And crap
[12:51:58] <Skizu_> I cant use console
[12:52:12] <Skizu_> As it's a standard js lib thing im doing
[12:52:24] <jeffsmykil> thanks ccmonster
[12:52:25] <Skizu_> Just $('body').removeClass('imgbg');
[12:52:35] <Skizu_> >_> how can i put a console log on that :/?
[12:52:35] <ccmonster> huh? how can you NOT use console.log?
[12:52:54] <ccmonster> console.log($('body').removeClass('imgb'));
[12:53:09] <Brodingo> that would just return a jquery object
[12:53:21] <ccmonster> yes, that would show him if it's removing the class
[12:53:23] <Brodingo> are you talking about just entering it into the console? not logging it?
[12:53:25] <ccmonster> you can see the attributes
[12:53:36] <interopcop> but this page is bigger than just that section and probably something around this div and scripts is causing this javascript to not tag along somehow
[12:54:15] <Skizu_> ccmonster i did that now
[12:54:35] <ccmonster> ok, now check it out in the console.
[12:54:36] <Brodingo> well some consoles are different, he might need console.dir to inspect the object
[12:54:43] <Skizu_> It returns the whole page on there - still including the mofo class
[12:54:59] <ccmonster> then split it into two parts.
[12:55:11] <Skizu_> What 2 parts are there ffs
[12:55:30] <ccmonster> $newpg = $('body'); console.log($newpg.removeClass('imgbg'));
[12:55:42] <ccmonster> just see if there is a timing issue. Is this ajax?
[12:55:54] <dp> http://jsfiddle.net/QehCK/5/ -- set some data, get some data; where in the DOM is 'this-is-a-test' stored? I don't see it *anywhere*
[12:56:07] <Skizu_> Ye
[12:56:12] <Skizu_> ccmonster -.-
[12:56:12] <ccmonster> did you see what the data page said dp? It should explain 'how it is stored'
[12:56:15] <ccmonster> i dont have all the details.
[12:56:15] <Skizu_> You said you was looking
[12:57:01] <ccmonster> dive me a link again skizu
[12:57:13] <dp> ccmonster: I did; the page does not explain, sadly
[12:57:19] <Skizu_> http://sirrus.co.cc/dynamic
[12:57:33] <dp> ccmonster: it just suggests that the data is attached to the DOM elements
[12:57:44] <Skizu_> The ajax is at the top of the script.js file
[12:58:24] <etcetera> is there a html element id convention you guys use?
[12:58:48] <etcetera> like parentdiv-action or is there no guidance and it's completely arbitrary
[12:58:50] <ccmonster> because its 'bgimg' not 'imgbg'
[12:59:03] <ccmonster> you are trying to remove a class which is not there.
[12:59:10] <etcetera> I'm thinking about something like {controller-[parentdiv]-action}
[12:59:12] <ccmonster> $('body').removeClass('bgimg') should work
[12:59:14] <etcetera> where parentdiv is optional.
[12:59:24] <ccmonster> which i just tested in the console and works
[12:59:27] <interopcop> so how do I troubleshoot?
[12:59:30] <ccmonster> $('body').removeClass('bgimg');
[12:59:31] <etcetera> so $("blogpost-addsection-submitbutton")
[12:59:46] <etcetera> or simply something like $("comment-addbutton")
[12:59:49] <Skizu_> TBH //suicide
[12:59:57] <interopcop> is there a way in firbug to ask if this javascript is actually identifying properly an id in the DOM?
[13:00:09] <ccmonster> just type it in
[13:00:27] <ccmonster> it will return the element you are operating on, or undefined or blank if it doesn't select something
[13:00:46] <interopcop> type it in where?
[13:00:49] <ccmonster> if you type in $('body'); in the console it should pop up and show you what it matched
[13:00:52] <ccmonster> int eh consoel of firebug
[13:01:13] <chrisbovard> How can I submit a form on a select box change? Without clicking the submit button (i need to hide the button).
[13:01:21] <ccmonster> btw skizu, your page is MUCH smoother w/o the bgimg
[13:01:57] <swiggy> http://pastebin.com/kGuUQxi6  --- how do i get a JSON 'check' on a form submission to pass/submit the form? It doesnt seem to fucking work =(
[13:02:01] <ccmonster> $('.myselectbox').change(function(e){$this = $(this);$this.parent('form').submit();})
[13:02:08] <ccmonster> or something like that chrisbovard
[13:02:26] <swiggy> data.matches == true means the json returns true
[13:02:30] <ccmonster> what you mean my 'check'
[13:02:38] <swiggy> and means the form should be submitted
[13:02:42] <swiggy> but it doesnt submit
[13:02:56] <swiggy> i have a json request to check a PHP session
[13:03:05] <swiggy> just pull up the pastebin
[13:03:08] <ccmonster> you do an empty check, you should maybe also check for undefined
[13:03:08] <Skizu_> ccmonster: instead of doing success: function(js) { eval(js); } can i just do bodyType: "script" ?
[13:03:27] <ccmonster> contentType?
[13:03:38] <swiggy> what? i do not have a problem with my json request
[13:03:47] <Skizu_> bodyType is meant to eval the thing ?
[13:03:51] <swiggy> i have a problem with the actual form submitting after the json request
[13:04:02] <ccmonster> not sure if its bodyType or content Type;, but that just tells what sort of content you are sending or receving, not what actaully happens. Success said "do this if we get a response back")
[13:04:20] <ccmonster> ok, it wasn't saying it was wrong, just suggesting.
[13:04:29] <ccmonster> ^- swiggy
[13:04:37] <swiggy> huh?
[13:05:08] <Skizu_> ccmonster: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#example-0
[13:05:26] <ccmonster> should you have data type and all that before 'complete:, success:" etc..?
[13:05:33] <ccmonster> not sure what it might matter, just seems backwards to me
[13:05:50] <interopcop> cc ok so this does match one and only one element.  So if nothing else the $(this).text('Hide Statistics'); ought to work, no?
[13:05:51] <swiggy> it doesnt matter, but will keep that into consideration
[13:06:04] <swiggy> the problem is the form wont submit, even with return true
[13:06:06] <chrisbovard> thanks ccmonster!!!!
[13:06:07] <Skizu_> Basically, I'm asking a way to not need to use eval()
[13:06:10] <ccmonster> ok, can yo uthrow together a fiddle?
[13:06:22] <interopcop> I mean I could put an alert in there first, but I doubt if it would fire because the javascript doesn't seem to be finding the link
[13:06:36] <ccmonster> are you trying to post via ajax, or post normally?
[13:06:41] <ccmonster> np chrisbovard
[13:06:56] <etcetera> anyone on id selector conventions?
[13:07:00] <Skizu_> I do an ajax post and then get ajax back which i want to execute
[13:07:08] <ccmonster> im not totally following interopcop
[13:07:41] <ccmonster> etcetera, i keep it simple
[13:07:49] <ccmonster> #parent-subsection-etc...
[13:08:07] <ccmonster> wahtever makes sense.
[13:08:12] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/636Ux/
[13:08:20] <etcetera> ccmonster: yea I can imagine full paths can get crazy
[13:08:31] <Skizu_> ccmonster, any way where i can do an ajax post with a js reply and not have to use eval() ?
[13:09:19] <ccmonster> yea, full paths means ALOT of extra typing and keeping names striaght
[13:09:22] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/636Ux/    - http://pastebin.com/kGuUQxi6    |      The form will not submit, even with return true; after the json request
[13:09:37] <ccmonster> js reply? explain skizu..?
[13:09:45] <swiggy> $.ajax returns true, either way (if it passes or not), but return true will not force the form to submit
[13:09:52] <etcetera> ccmonster: but do you keep your javascript inline with the views or seperate? I ask because if I have an "submit-button" and I decide to use that id elsewhere...
[13:09:57] <etcetera> that could get tricky.
[13:11:27] <ccmonster> seperate it.
[13:11:39] <swiggy> helpppppp
[13:11:43] <ccmonster> always seperate if possible. You'll appreciate it in the end.
[13:12:01] <kegi> hi all, can i call .live with the event type being a dialog?
[13:12:02] <swiggy> you directing that at me?
[13:12:14] <ccmonster> etcetera, not you swiggy
[13:12:17] <jethrot> question about firebug, i have a breakpoint set inside an onstatechange callback, yet it doesn't seem to break there, is that an issue with my code or with firebug?
[13:12:22] <ccmonster> yes kegi .
[13:12:45] <etcetera> ccmonster: that brings back into question scope of the selector :-P
[13:12:55] <ccmonster> your code. You are obviously not getting to the onstatechange, or you are handling the on state change inccorectly. Pastie your code and someone can try to help you
[13:13:16] <jethrot> instead of pastie just look at it here: https://www.gudagi.com/sites/3839595X/dev/web/contact.php
[13:13:19] <etcetera> if I keep a central file it'll have to select a very verbose id.
[13:13:37] <ccmonster> $('.mySubmitButton').submit(function(e){//do a bunch of stuff here...})
[13:13:43] <ccmonster> that's how etcetera .
[13:13:55] <swiggy> ccmonster did u look at my fiddle?
[13:13:58] <ccmonster> you can use regex selecters.
[13:14:06] <ccmonster> i am looking at it now swiggy.
[13:14:43] <ccmonster> etcetera, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/190253/jquery-selector-regular-expressions
[13:15:14] <etcetera> ccmonster: right i'd rather have explicit selectors though and keep it simple with unique ids.
[13:15:27] <etcetera> it makes a lot more sense at the expense of being more verbose.
[13:15:43] <b1lly> im using var myObject = JSON.parse(data) ; and its returning a bunch of objects, i just dont know how to open them and find out their properties
[13:15:59] <b1lly> like i tryed to console.log(myObject->idorder); but its triggering an error
[13:16:19] <jethrot> ....
[13:16:22] <jethrot> instead of pastie just look at it here: https://www.gudagi.com/sites/3839595X/dev/web/contact.php
[13:16:32] <jkoudys> How can I find the first instance of a class for a dom? e.g. I have two divs, <div class="foo rank1">, <div class="rank2 bar">. I'd like something to just say whatever classes in the element start with rank.
[13:17:04] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/636Ux/
[13:17:09] <ccmonster> check it swiggy
[13:17:14] <ccmonster> its posting.
[13:18:02] <ccmonster> well, you can always do $('#myverboseparentID >elementType).event()
[13:18:03] <jethrot> http://pastie.org/private/qvrugwh5xzdg6kogz7fbw
[13:18:11] <kegi> ccmonster: Cant find the problem with this, it works when its just .dialog, im trying to add .live and now i have a syntax error http://pastebin.com/Jv3h6KSE
[13:18:37] <etcetera> ccmonster: correct. I think I'll go verbose.
[13:18:57] <ccmonster> I shy away from LOTS of id's and verboseness like that
[13:19:32] <ccmonster> I like explicite where it's needed, but i try to focus on elments from there on. I try to work with id less and classless elements as much as possible.
[13:19:59] <ccmonster> if you know it's always the first div under #myparent then $(#myparent div').  // stuff..
[13:20:26] <jethrot> ?
[13:20:30] <ccmonster> or $('#myparentdiv div').index(0) or something
[13:21:00] <ccmonster> there might be some processing expense doing it different ways which could maybe make a certain practice the 'best'
[13:21:20] <ccmonster> looking jethrot
[13:21:24] <jethrot> ty
[13:21:35] <ccmonster> ok, so what's your issue..?
[13:21:46] <jethrot> doesnt call onreadystatechange
[13:21:53] <jethrot> or firebug doesn't stop in there
[13:23:14] <ccmonster> you aren't even using jquery there.
[13:23:37] <jethrot> yes but #ajax is dead
[13:23:38] <ccmonster> you can rewrite that in jquery.
[13:23:43] <ccmonster> haha then try #javascript
[13:23:52] <jethrot> i cannot rely on jquery there
[13:23:58] <ccmonster> this isn't jquery
[13:24:07] <jethrot> well, #javascript is dead too
[13:24:20] <ccmonster> well, rewrite this in jquery as a $.ajax
[13:24:23] <ccmonster> and you shoudl be in business
[13:24:25] <jethrot> can't
[13:24:43] <ccmonster> why not ?
[13:24:43] <jethrot> can't do that, can't use jquery
[13:24:47] <ccmonster> why not ?
[13:24:47] <Ankabout> Hi, I'm using a slidedown function for a news page, and it's jumping at the last 20 pixels or so. I can't seem to find why, can anyone advice me?
[13:24:51] <Ankabout> advise*
[13:24:52] <jethrot> because then it relies on jquery
[13:25:13] <ccmonster> Well, that's just a simple readystate if if if case.
[13:25:25] <ccmonster> you shoul be able to find some bulletproof xhr code somewhere. google it
[13:26:00] <jethrot> ccmonster it was working now it is not working perhaps due to SSL?  I cannot tell
[13:26:21] <ccmonster> ssl could mess with it. use the console. see what it's throwing
[13:26:45] <jethrot> its not throwing anything
[13:26:49] <jethrot> code never reaches onreadystatechange
[13:27:04] <jethrot> it simply returns a response of 'pass' and 200
[13:27:13] <jethrot> but does nothing with it
[13:27:50] <ccmonster> so you are getting 200 back ?
[13:28:19] <ccmonster> console.log() out all over the place. figure out where it's getting to exactly.
[13:28:27] <ccmonster> that way you dont have to worry about one breakpoint
[13:29:35] <b1lly> is there a way to loop through a json object
[13:29:44] <b1lly> and return all the main keys
[13:30:10] <b1lly> so i can be like          var dog =  object1->dogname;
[13:30:22] <draginx> Any idea on how to make the newlines into \n for an ajax form?
[13:30:32] <jeffsmykil> can you put settimeout inside of an if?
[13:30:36] <jeffsmykil> and have it work properly?
[13:30:50] <jeffsmykil> or will it just run the if part over and over
[13:30:56] <ccmonster> sure. just look up settimeout examples jeffsmykil
[13:31:12] <stuffmc> hi
[13:31:31] <ccmonster> here is a simple example jeffsmykil , http://pastie.org/2341201
[13:31:33] <ccmonster> hi stuffmc
[13:31:39] <stuffmc> it's a #jquery-ui question so hopping over there I guess:)
[13:31:55] <ccmonster> ok
[13:32:11] <interopcop> ccmonster: I have a working jquery script, and I have clean html, but the script doesn't cause a change in the DOM.  I can't tell why.  How can I use firebug to figure out why?
[13:33:03] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster is the keypress canceling the timeout>
[13:33:08] <jeffsmykil> hard to tell without comments
[13:33:26] <jethrot> ccmonster: yes I get 200, and a response text
[13:33:29] <stuffmc> not much answer (and less people) there so trying here
[13:33:30] <stuffmc> I can't reproduce a "drop" — the "over" works in my .droppable() but not the "drop"
[13:33:48] <stuffmc> any idea y?
[13:33:55] <phlp> interopcop: is the code in $(document).ready ?
[13:34:16] <dash> anybody here use qunit and mockjax for testing XHR calls? does it work... at all?
[13:34:25] <ccmonster> ok, so where in your code is that firing jethrot
[13:34:39] <jethrot> when you click the send button on the contact form at the site
[13:34:43] <jethrot> https://www.gudagi.com/sites/3839595X/dev/web/contact.php
[13:34:55] <interopcop> phlp: what does that mean?  sorr I'm very new to jquery
[13:35:11] <stuffmc> $(".ui-sortable tr").each(function() {
[13:35:11] <stuffmc>  $($(this)).droppable({
[13:35:11] <stuffmc>    accept: "tr",
[13:35:11] <stuffmc>    drop: function(e, ui) {
[13:35:11] <stuffmc>      console.log('dropped');
[13:35:12] <stuffmc>    },
[13:35:12] <stuffmc>    over: function(e, ui) {
[13:35:13] <stuffmc>      ui.draggable.insertAfter(this);
[13:35:13] <stuffmc>    }
[13:35:14] <stuffmc>  });
[13:35:14] <stuffmc> });
[13:35:19] <phlp> interopcop: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html#chapter-3
[13:35:21] <jethrot> stuffmc use pastie.org you spammer
[13:35:21] <stuffmc> the "over" part works fine
[13:35:24] <chjj> have you heard of pastebin?
[13:35:26] <diegoviola> stuffmc: dude use pastebin
[13:35:27] <dash> in particular i'm not seeing my success callbacks get fired when calling $.ajax() for a mockjax request
[13:35:32] <chjj> or gist? or any number of paste sites?
[13:35:46] <jethrot> interopcop no one likes a cop, but you can use Firebug to be a Bug Cop, now go fix that slop
[13:35:46] <stuffmc> the "drop" don't, although I have "drop" working fine at another place
[13:36:00] <ccmonster> jeffsmykil, yes. Anytime the keypress occurs and its a certain category and nto a ctrl key, it clears the delay, then triggers the new delay.
[13:36:01] <jethrot> cha cha cha
[13:36:14] <jethrot> Dow has worst day since December 2008.
[13:36:19] <diegoviola> stuffmc: use this next time: http://gist.github.com/
[13:36:22] <interopcop> phlp: then, yes the code is in $(document).ready
[13:36:30] <interopcop> it's actually your code
[13:36:40] <interopcop> http://jsfiddle.net/QehCK/2/
[13:37:11] <stuffmc> https://gist.github.com/1132675
[13:37:23] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster: does cleartimeout stop the timeout as well
[13:37:28] <jeffsmykil> or just reset it
[13:38:02] <ccmonster> reset in that instance. it basically says, stop the timer, reset it and add a new one
[13:38:18] <ccmonster> so if you are typing and you hit a regular key, each subsequent keypress restarts the timer.
[13:38:24] <ccmonster> its for a autosearch implementation
[13:38:38] <ccmonster> so 2 seconds after you finish typing, it will search even if you dont hit enter or something
[13:38:45] <jeffsmykil> but clearTimeout();
[13:38:47] <jeffsmykil> stops the timeout
[13:39:10] <stuffmc> gisted it: https://gist.github.com/1132675 jQuery-ui Draggable Droppable can't drop
[13:39:15] <ccmonster> it clears it
[13:39:31] <ccmonster> google cleartimeout/settimeout you will get some great examples, im sure.
[13:39:48] <jeffsmykil> sorry for being dense ccmonster
[13:40:19] <dash> any qunit users here? looking for info on testing xhr/ajax calls
[13:40:40] <ccmonster> naw, you're fine. Just can't go into the nitty gritty. I wrote that code ages ago as well (it's pretty blah anyway lol) and i'd rather send you down the right path and have you figure it for yourself than lecture on it and it not sink in because of me perhaps
[13:40:53] <jethrot> http://pastie.org/private/qvrugwh5xzdg6kogz7fbw
[13:40:54] <ccmonster> havent used it dash. know it's getting popular
[13:41:21] <jethrot> ccmonster: scroll right to see the call on the button
[13:42:10] <ccmonster> ok?
[13:42:23] <dash> ccmonster: ah. so what do _you_ use for tests? :)
[13:42:29] <jethrot> <ccmonster> ok, so where in your code is that firing jethrot
[13:43:57] <chjj> hey jquery pro's, how often to jquery actually use jQuery.expr internally?
[13:44:05] <chjj> how often does*
[13:44:54] <ccmonster> i dont test lol
[13:45:03] <ccmonster> i just code and debug like a monster :)
[13:45:04] <dash> ccmonster: Oh :(
[13:45:13] <dash> ccmonster: then how do you know that your software works? =|
[13:45:18] <ccmonster> haha.
[13:45:19] <ccmonster> user testing.
[13:45:39] <dash> that takes way too long. oh well
[13:45:44] <ccmonster> naw i write small unit tests on occasion. But most of the stuff i have to do is internal tools so I get feedback pretty quickly.
[13:45:58] <chjj> i dont like testing apps either, i test libraries and anything less tangible than an app, but i hate writing tests for apps
[13:46:32] <ccmonster> Now, if i'm doing something 'official' and needs testing, I thank god for junit and whatnot
[13:46:42] <ccmonster> but that's because the enterprise stuff I do is typically java, and not js
[13:47:11] <chjj> ew, java
[13:47:26] <ccmonster> WTF? JAVA is amazing.
[13:47:27] <ccmonster> :)
[13:47:36] <chjj> im glad i made myself unlearn that language
[13:47:45] <ccmonster> java, groovy, grails are all quite nice.
[13:47:54] <ccmonster> Scala
[13:47:56] <ccmonster> all fun stuff
[13:48:02] <chjj> never understood why computer science courses were so eager to teach java
[13:48:19] <ccmonster> because it's very versatile? And OpenSource.
[13:48:29] <ccmonster> Not that other languages dont have that.
[13:48:54] <diegoviola> ccmonster: because it's very widespread?
[13:49:04] <ccmonster> sure, that as well.
[13:49:10] <diegoviola> ccmonster: in the enterprise, and students can get jobs with their java knowledge?
[13:49:18] <Eviltwin> They taught Java because Java became the new definition of OO
[13:49:32] <Eviltwin> Now Java's losing market share to things like Python
[13:49:36] <ccmonster> yup. It's cheap to run a Java Shop. No need for tons of money to do a .Net house
[13:49:43] <ccmonster> and paying MS out the nose just to get started.
[13:50:02] <chjj> prototypal oo = best, i dont even want oo in languages that arent high level
[13:50:18] <chjj> its why i dont like java, why i dont like c++, and why i love c
[13:50:19] <Eviltwin> I think OO implies high-level
[13:50:22] <phlp> it's because the engineering and law colleges can share resources. the engineers learn java and the lawyers learn how to sue people using java
[13:50:28] <dash> "OO" is a fake idea
[13:50:31] <chjj> Eviltwin: you consider c++ high level?
[13:50:33] <dash> phlp: zing
[13:50:41] <dash> chjj: i don't consider C++ "OO" ;)
[13:50:46] <ccmonster> haha phlp , if you are Oracle, true :)
[13:50:54] <chjj> why not?
[13:50:58] <stuffmc> anybody looked at my gist? :)
[13:51:05] <stuffmc> might be something very obvious
[13:51:18] <stuffmc> https://gist.github.com/1132675 jQuery-ui Draggable Droppable can't drop
[13:51:19] <Eviltwin> stuffmc: Paste again?
[13:51:23] <ccmonster> its ui stuff stuffmc , go to #jquery-ui
[13:51:29] <Topcat> I thought if I put stuff inside a function I don't have to worry about it intil I actually call the function. I'm getting errors and it shouldn't even be run yet.
[13:51:30] <stuffmc> I'm there!
[13:51:39] <dash> well if you guys don;t know stuff about qunit i'm going to find a channel that does
[13:51:42] <stuffmc> #jqueri-ui
[13:51:48] <ccmonster> because you are referencing stuff that doesn't exist Topcat .
[13:51:48] <stuffmc> but it's dead :D
[13:51:57] <ccmonster> or have general errors.
[13:52:00] <diegoviola> it would be nice if universities teached something like haskell instead of java
[13:52:15] <diegoviola> functional programming
[13:52:21] <chjj> or C, i had to teach myself C when in cs
[13:52:30] <chjj> because they were too busy teaching shit, like java
[13:52:41] <Eviltwin> stuffmc: Have you tried $(this).insertAfter instead?
[13:52:46] <stuffmc> not teaching C is a real problem
[13:52:49] <Eviltwin> Og
[13:52:50] <Eviltwin> Oh*
[13:53:02] <Eviltwin> stuffmc: Try ui.draggable.insertAfter($(this))
[13:53:05] <stuffmc> I was happy enought to have it, but to be honnest, I had to re-teach it myself when starting with cocoa
[13:53:17] <stuffmc> Eviltwin: did you read my comment? :)
[13:53:19] <stuffmc> this part works
[13:53:20] <techdev> Hey all
[13:53:25] <stuffmc> the "drop" part don't
[13:53:28] <diegoviola> chjj: i agree, c is very important
[13:53:52] <stuffmc> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qrTz4tKPw  :-)
[13:54:00] <Eviltwin> stuffmc: I can't be expected to read what's written in here
[13:54:01] <phlp> i learned c and lisp as part of my degree, as well as java
[13:54:21] <techdev> Would anyone in here be willing and able to help me resolve a jquery ui / CSS issue?
[13:54:35] <ccmonster> just post it techdev , or link a pasti
[13:54:44] <techdev> sure thing, thanks
[13:54:45] <JasonC_> hey guys. im having some issues with a draggable div... on the draggable's stop event, I nudge the divs position (by changing the style left and top attributes).  But, the div stops being draggable and freezes in place after the stop event is called. suggestions?
[13:54:50] <ccmonster> i didnt even go for computer science, but oh well :)
[13:55:20] <Eviltwin> stuffmc: You're dropping table rows on table rows?
[13:55:51] <stuffmc> yes
[13:56:00] <ccmonster> should be before or after, correct?
[13:56:06] <stuffmc> yes
[13:56:35] <techdev> My issue is about including a custom theme in a web project. One of my divs in a table has this theme applied to it, and it should display a certain icon, which it does. But, it also seems to have a background of all the other icons plastered to it, which obscures things a bit. I'm wondering if anyone know what might be causing this
[13:57:27] <Eviltwin> stuffmc: Are you using debiug tools?
[13:57:49] <stuffmc> well *nothing* happens
[13:58:03] <stuffmc> which debug tools? I'm using the ones in Safari, mostly the console
[13:58:03] <Eviltwin> I thought the insertAfter was working
[13:58:08] <stuffmc> it is
[13:58:12] <stuffmc> on over
[13:58:20] <stuffmc> but I want to do something else on drop
[13:58:33] <stuffmc> actually I don't wanna do anything on over :)
[13:58:36] <stuffmc> but that's another story
[13:59:11] <Eviltwin> I'm wondering if because of the over, it's deciding not to trigger the drop
[13:59:55] <Eviltwin> I don't know how they implemented it
[14:00:12] <Eviltwin> But you should be doing $(this).droppable not $($(this)).droppable
[14:00:25] <Topcat> From what I can tell. object.id should get me the id header from div id="header" but it's giving me undefined instead. am i using it wrong?
[14:00:27] <Eviltwin> And you should probably be doing ui.draggable.insertAfter($(this)) rather than ui.draggable.insertAFter(this)
[14:00:47] <interopcop> phlp: it wasn't in the $(document).ready()
[14:00:51] <interopcop> rofl
[14:00:56] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/636Ux/    - http://pastebin.com/kGuUQxi6    |      How do i use a JSON/Ajax request in a Form Validation script to submit the form???
[14:01:02] <Eviltwin> Topcat: if it's a jQuery object, you can't just do .id
[14:01:08] <swiggy> even with return true; the form will not submit
[14:01:15] <interopcop> I guess that jsfiddle must wrap the code in the $(document).ready() ?
[14:01:31] <ccmonster> swiggy, , i thought we convered this?
[14:01:40] <swiggy> i never got an answer i remember..
[14:01:45] <Topcat>  Eviltwin  yeh it is. well it's what's returned from $(this).parent('div') so that's a jquery object right?
[14:02:30] <phlp> interopcop: yes it does
[14:02:39] <swiggy> tell me again ccmonster?
[14:03:07] <Topcat> Eviltwin : cheers, made me find object.attr(id) instead.
[14:03:11] <interopcop> well, thanks for your help.  msg me your email address if you have a paypal acct, I'll send you a few bucks
[14:03:19] <Eviltwin> swiggy: This is basically what's happening: http://pastebin.com/4VXRN0Vu
[14:03:40] <stuffmc> ah
[14:03:41] <swiggy> yeah i guess
[14:03:43] <stuffmc> now sometimes it work
[14:03:48] <stuffmc> sometimes it doesn't
[14:03:51] <stuffmc> very weird
[14:04:07] <_pr0t0type_> Hey guys, is there a way to prevent a specific event from happening for a period, but then removing that prevention after a period
[14:04:14] <Eviltwin> Topcat: You're welcome
[14:04:15] <_pr0t0type_> using jquery of course
[14:04:31] <stuffmc> but yeah
[14:04:37] <stuffmc> removing the "over" helps a lot
[14:05:06] <Eviltwin> _pr0t0type_: function x(){return false;} $("body").bind("click",x); setTimeout(function() { $("body").unbind("click",x); }, 10000); ?
[14:05:06] <stuffmc> it's probably that one or the other is taken and in some cases the dropped isn't called… since I don't really need over, I'm fine :)
[14:05:18] <stuffmc> thanks folks for the brainstorn ;) ttyl
[14:05:19] <Eviltwin> stuffmc: Cool
[14:05:45] <phlp> interopcop: no its ok glad to help :)
[14:06:09] <_pr0t0type_> hmm, Eviltwin: perhaps, let me give it a try
[14:06:12] <Topcat> it looks like I can but can someone tell me if it behaves the same. var test = this.animate(a bunch); and then just call test
[14:09:25] <Eviltwin> swiggy: Try: http://jsfiddle.net/CDyPd/1/
[14:10:21] <swiggy> thats good thinking let me try
[14:10:34] <JasonC_> im having some issues with a draggable div. on the draggable's stop event, I nudge the divs position (by changing the style left and top attributes).  But, the div stops being draggable and freezes in place after the stop event is called. suggestions?
[14:10:36] <Guest26888> hiya ben_alman you got a sec? have you decoupled the $.deparam from bbq yet? I've found a gist
[14:10:50] <etcetera> so I have a button inside a facebox dialog.
[14:11:10] <JasonC_> it seems that setting .style.left and/or .style.top makes the div no longer draggable
[14:11:12] <etcetera> and then I have a jquery selector $("#cancel-button").click(function() { console.log } );
[14:11:21] <etcetera> but the console.log never gets called.
[14:11:54] <aaronmcadam> hiya ben_alman you got a sec? have you decoupled the $.deparam from bbq yet? I've found a gist
[14:12:00] <aaronmcadam> or anyone?
[14:12:45] <swiggy> nope Eviltwin =\
[14:17:44] <Rushing> anyone know why a client's ajax cache is not clearing? driving me nuts...they get the latest HTML and JS files, but the request for AJAX just won't clear
[14:18:04] <Rushing> tried clearing cache, cookies, form history, restarting browser
[14:18:49] <Rushing> they even tried from another computer and the change in the ajax response just doesn't show...like it's a network thing
[14:18:52] <aaronmcadam> is it a GET request?
[14:18:55] <Rushing> yes
[14:18:59] <aaronmcadam> on IE?
[14:19:01] <Rushing> i just don't get why other resources would be OK
[14:19:09] <Rushing> well, she primarily uses IE, but we tried in FF too
[14:19:13] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[14:19:18] <aaronmcadam> you could try cache bursting
[14:19:24] <aaronmcadam> it's an option you can pass
[14:19:30] <Itrace> I built this image slider that uses "setInterval()" to show different slides every 3 seconds. If you go to a different tab in your browser and wait for a minute then return to the page. The slider goes crazy and triggers a bunch of times really fast. I have seen other implementations of this, but mine is the only one that sucks. What am I doing wrong? Here is the code: http://jsbin.com/egifat/2/edit
[14:19:35] <etcetera> anyone using facebox. I cannot call functions outside the facebox defined view :-(
[14:20:03] <aaronmcadam> cache : false Rushing
[14:20:09] <Rushing> theoretically, that's what cache:false should do, but that gives me a 404
[14:20:17] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[14:20:17] <Rushing> just some issues with the way the content is generated at that URL
[14:20:26] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[14:20:30] <aaronmcadam> what's the server side?
[14:20:44] <Rushing> php ExpressionEngine
[14:21:02] <Rushing> and i'm actually caching the response in a static html file and returning that
[14:21:03] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[14:21:09] <aaronmcadam> I remember having issues with EE
[14:21:14] <aaronmcadam> using ajax
[14:21:24] <aaronmcadam> the way it's url patterns handle things
[14:21:29] <Rushing> lol yeah, don't get me started -_-
[14:21:37] <Rushing> BUT, my boss and i are getting the latest content
[14:21:39] <aaronmcadam> there was a helper I used I *think*
[14:21:42] <aaronmcadam> been ages ago tho
[14:21:50] <aaronmcadam> right
[14:22:05] <aaronmcadam> have you tried cache bursting the actual js file?
[14:22:16] <aaronmcadam> probably won't make a difference but maybe
[14:22:37] <aaronmcadam> I always try n cache burst on a client facing dev site
[14:22:49] <aaronmcadam> cuz of all the changes
[14:23:07] <Rushing> no, but i put an alert in for her just to see if she could see it, and she did, so i know she's getting the latest js
[14:23:13] <aaronmcadam> right
[14:23:27] <aaronmcadam> can you clear your memcache?
[14:23:44] <aaronmcadam> it's in settings somewhere
[14:24:13] <aaronmcadam> is this site a refresh or new project?
[14:24:32] <ccmonster> sbah.
[14:24:36] <aaronmcadam> ah but your caching to get around EE's urls
[14:24:46] <Rushing> new project. new meaning it has not launched. not new considering when we started it
[14:24:57] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[14:25:02] <Rushing> no, caching to get around EE's POS template tag processing slowness
[14:25:10] <aaronmcadam> POS?
[14:25:13] <etcetera> wow so this us foocacta.
[14:25:20] <etcetera> facebox scopes functions relative to it's rendered div!
[14:25:31] <aaronmcadam> it's an ancient plugin
[14:25:33] <Rushing> it takes up to 2 minutes for EE to load the page without the cache
[14:25:39] <aaronmcadam> unless it's been updated recently
[14:25:52] <aaronmcadam> man you must be doing somethin crazy with your tags
[14:26:08] <aaronmcadam> you messing around with parse orders?
[14:26:15] <Rushing> nah, that's what's rediculous. there are just almost 700 entries we're trying to load
[14:26:28] <aaronmcadam> fuck, just to hide them all and jquery paginate em i bet
[14:26:43] <Rushing> it's a google map, so kinda
[14:26:47] <Rushing> lots of toggling and filtering
[14:26:50] <aaronmcadam> can't you render to json?
[14:26:59] <aaronmcadam> and use jquery tmpl, mustache, etc
[14:27:20] <Rushing> eh, no need. json would speed it up some, but the response isn't actually that big
[14:27:31] <aaronmcadam> it's the query
[14:27:36] <Rushing> it's just how many loops EE has to do, and again, their template tags are an abomination
[14:27:39] <aaronmcadam> then
[14:27:42] <aaronmcadam> nested loops?
[14:27:48] <_pr0t0type_> hey guys, for some reason, mouse leave registers as such, even if you are merely mouse entering an inner element.  Take for instance, and drop down within a drop down, where the inner one is completely encapsulated by the outer one.  If you register a mouse leave on the outer one, simply mouse entering the inner one will register as a mouse leave.   But hear is the thing, THIS works fine in Chrome 12, but all browsers
[14:27:57] <_pr0t0type_> all other browsers that is, break
[14:28:00] <aaronmcadam> you tried using custom sql?
[14:28:21] <aaronmcadam> I ended up using that a few times
[14:28:33] <ccmonster> event.stopPropogation()
[14:28:41] <_pr0t0type_> The question is, do  any of you guys know to fix this?
[14:28:43] <Rushing> no, but the load time isn't really our concern anymore ;) caching the output as static html is pretty much as fast as it can get
[14:28:45] <ccmonster> and i thnk this is explained somewhere about nested mouseleave
[14:28:48] <aaronmcadam> but yeah I feel your pain, I've hit that before
[14:29:13] <ccmonster> where is the master jqueryui loacated.
[14:29:50] <aaronmcadam> _pr0t0type_: you aware of how js's event model works?
[14:30:15] <_pr0t0type_> aaronmcadam: sort of, there is the bubble vs. capture stages
[14:30:20] <aaronmcadam> weird that chrome is working
[14:30:26] <Rushing> the fact that my boss and i get the correct content on different networks, and she and a coworker do not get the latest ajax response on the same network, makes me think it's a network cache issue. i jsut don't see how that would be isolated to the ajax requests
[14:30:57] <aaronmcadam> couldn't really be that tho surely
[14:31:26] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[14:31:29] <aaronmcadam> it's a long shot
[14:31:37] <aaronmcadam> but you *could* pass it to yql to make sure
[14:31:53] <aaronmcadam> the yql plugin is handy
[14:32:49] <aaronmcadam> that way the request would come from yahoo
[14:32:55] <Itrace> Is there a better way to do this: http://jsbin.com/egifat/2/edit#preview The main problem is that if you switch to a different tab for a few minutes then return it goes crazy. Is my code completely wrong?
[14:33:10] <aaronmcadam> her pc > yahoo > your server > yahoo > her pc
[14:33:32] <ccmonster> i dont see tabs
[14:33:37] <aaronmcadam> Rushing: https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/jquery-yql/
[14:34:55] <mythril> is there a way to remove an item from a jquery collection by reference?
[14:35:08] <ccmonster> sure, by index,
[14:35:16] <ccmonster> or by many other means.
[14:35:25] <ccmonster> pastie.
[14:35:27] <ccmonster> or fiddle
[14:35:36] <Rushing> thanks aaronmcadam. i've not used yql at all, so i'll save the learning curve for another time...over budget and just plain nagged by this map
[14:36:18] <aaronmcadam> it's very easy Rushing
[14:36:35] <aaronmcadam> you should have something in like 10 mins tops
[14:36:46] <aaronmcadam> select html from { url }
[14:36:54] <draginx> Is there a way to get jquery templates to load within a file rather than inline?
[14:37:00] <aaronmcadam> select html from result where url = {url} even
[14:37:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[14:37:17] <aaronmcadam> just include the script right
[14:37:30] <aaronmcadam> or you could use getScript
[14:37:30] <draginx> well its not a valid js syntax… O_o
[14:37:40] <aaronmcadam> or have the template within script tags
[14:37:48] <aaronmcadam> you pass it with a different type attr
[14:37:56] <Rushing> right. it looks simple enough, but it's going to rabbit trail. i know the response is correct because we get it on networks in 2 different states, but i can't figure out what's going on with the client's network
[14:38:07] <aaronmcadam> and then do $('#template').html()
[14:38:16] <ccmonster> Itrace, it's a bunch of queued animations occurring at once.
[14:38:23] <aaronmcadam> Rushing: as i said, just a long shot to see
[14:38:24] <ccmonster> you need some queeuing of animations I believe.
[14:38:28] <ccmonster> i didnt look at the script much
[14:38:29] <draginx> aaronmcadam: so like I can have <script id="blah" type="™pl…"></script> in a js file? O-o
[14:38:59] <aaronmcadam> no
[14:39:00] <draginx> Or would each template have to be its own js file? :(
[14:39:01] <Itrace> ccmonster: im using setInterval().
[14:39:13] <aaronmcadam> you've got 2 opts
[14:39:27] <ccmonster> hm, well it's still queuing them up.
[14:39:42] <ccmonster> log out a message that occurs each time the number changes.
[14:39:50] <acidjazz> does jquery work ok w/ canvas?
[14:39:55] <acidjazz>     this.ctx = $('#map').getContext('2d');
[14:39:55] <ccmonster> reproduce the issue, and watch the console to figure out where things are going wrong.
[14:40:05] <acidjazz> $("#map").getContext is not a function
[14:40:23] <Itrace> ccmonster: Thanks.
[14:41:51] <JasonC_> http://pastebin.com/1Aia8R1h apparently my dragStop() function is breaking this simple implementation... After dragging the div once, it freezes in place and is no longer draggable. any suggestions?
[14:42:27] <JasonC_> i suspect it has something to do with overwritting .style.left and top, but I have no idea why that would stop the div from being draggable any more?
[14:42:31] <ccmonster> gnarf,  you around bro?
[14:42:39] <aaronmcadam> dragnix
[14:42:40] <swiggy> ccmonster & Eviltwin -- solution to my problem: setting a variable and checking that variable on the form validation:  http://pastebin.com/d9hBCVDe
[14:42:56] <swiggy> i also set an onchange event when the solution of the captcha is changed, to do a json request
[14:42:59] <aaronmcadam> dragnix, <script id="summaryTemplate" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl">....</script>
[14:43:06] <swiggy> and duplicated that code in the actual form validation aswell
[14:43:08] <aaronmcadam> or else use getScript to pull in your tmpl
[14:43:18] <aaronmcadam> with just the template code there
[14:43:18] <swiggy> this will cover any 'bugs' with them skipping in between the ajax requests
[14:43:38] <aaronmcadam> I wrote a very simple template loader before
[14:43:55] <ccmonster> good to hear.
[14:45:28] <acidjazz> am i crazy what is going on here :  this.can = document.getElementById('map'); this.ctx = this.can.getContext('2d'); i get : this.can.getContext is not a function
[14:45:57] <aaronmcadam> you sure the func has support in the browser?
[14:46:07] <aaronmcadam> can't remember which one didn't have full support
[14:47:31] <etcetera> can anyone tell me why jqueyr events wont work inside facebox?
[14:47:34] <ccmonster> yea one of them lacks full sipport.
[14:47:41] <aaronmcadam> facebox is ancient
[14:47:46] <ccmonster> facebox? that's old as dirt.
[14:47:48] <ccmonster> upgrade homie!
[14:47:48] <etcetera> is there something better?
[14:48:01] <aaronmcadam> jquery ui is the standard I use or fancybox
[14:48:14] <Aristata> Hello, I am doing a get to my server via ajax, it works in chrome and firefor, but in ie it's giving me a 302
[14:48:16] <Aristata> wth
[14:48:24] <etcetera> aaronmcadam: you mean lightbox?
[14:48:28] <aaronmcadam> no
[14:48:30] <aaronmcadam> I mean fancybox
[14:48:32] <Aristata> What does it mean, and what steps should I take to get rid of this 303
[14:48:34] <Aristata> 304
[14:48:35] <aaronmcadam> that's why i said it
[14:48:40] <datarecall> any thoughts on why this doesnt work : http://jsfiddle.net/Fg3FL/ trying to hide the first div and then show the newdiv and shake it
[14:48:42] <Aristata> it's certainly, positivly a 204
[14:48:45] <Aristata> omg
[14:48:46] <etcetera> lol.
[14:48:46] <Aristata> 304
[14:48:48] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[14:48:49] <aaronmcadam> haha
[14:48:52] <aaronmcadam> make up your mind
[14:48:53] <aaronmcadam> lol
[14:49:01] <Aristata> 304 guys, 304
[14:49:03] <etcetera> is there a jquery ui dialog box that looks like facebox?
[14:49:03] <Aristata> :p
[14:49:05] <Aristata> Long day
[14:49:15] <aaronmcadam> very strange
[14:49:21] <aaronmcadam> what server side lang?
[14:49:33] <Aristata> ruby on rails
[14:49:41] <aaronmcadam> CSRF stuff?
[14:49:50] <aaronmcadam> I use django it has that kinda stuff
[14:49:55] <Aristata> hmmm
[14:50:03] <aaronmcadam> are you using a GET when you should be POSTing?
[14:50:05] <Aristata> I will check that out, I didn't think about the csrf
[14:50:12] <ccmonster> dialog can be made to look facebook like
[14:50:14] <Aristata> no it's just grabbing a partial of a page
[14:50:24] <aaronmcadam> yeah how is it doing that
[14:50:27] <aaronmcadam> a GET?
[14:50:30] <aaronmcadam> check firebug
[14:50:30] <Aristata> yeah
[14:50:34] <aaronmcadam> kk
[14:50:38] <ccmonster> good ol firebug  is your friend
[14:50:45] <datarecall> i can get it to work without the function but then effect wont fire
[14:50:48] <Aristata> .get(/some path_where_new_content_lives
[14:51:03] <ccmonster> or .load()
[14:51:11] <aaronmcadam> right
[14:51:13] <ccmonster> $('#myDivContainer').load()..
[14:51:23] <ccmonster> whichever is clever.
[14:51:24] <aaronmcadam> sounds like there's some safeguards in that view Aristata
[14:51:43] <aaronmcadam> i'm not a rails guy so can't be certain
[14:51:57] <ccmonster> rails = blah. :)
[14:52:07] <aaronmcadam> what u on ccmonster
[14:52:09] <Aristata> Well, so long as there isn't some, omg IE ALWAYS does that when you do this bug then I am sure I will figure it out
[14:52:14] <ccmonster> give me grails , django
[14:52:19] <ccmonster> lol
[14:52:22] <aaronmcadam> cool i'm on django
[14:53:17] <etcetera> anyone, I'm trying to get jquery ui dialog to reject the standard UI themes.
[14:53:23] <aaronmcadam> lol
[14:53:25] <etcetera> and any subsequent ui css. how do I override it?
[14:53:26] <aaronmcadam> good luck with that
[14:53:33] <aaronmcadam> don't include the css ...
[14:53:35] <ccmonster> just overwrite the themes etcetera. there is a css guide to the classses used
[14:53:42] <aaronmcadam> and copy the class names
[14:53:44] <datarecall> anyone, im loosing my wig here ? :)
[14:53:47] <ccmonster> or dont include and reuse the names
[14:53:56] <ccmonster> what aaronmcadam said lol
[14:54:00] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster++
[14:54:03] <Itrace> ccmonster: It looks like it was queuing the ".animation()" function. Know of any tricks I can use to solve that?  http://jsbin.com/egifat/3/edit#preview
[14:54:05] <aaronmcadam> great minds dude :P
[14:54:18] <aaronmcadam> datarecall: what's wrong with ye? your wig looks good :p
[14:54:23] <etcetera> lol, don't include the css.
[14:54:30] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[14:54:32] <aaronmcadam> rebuild it
[14:54:40] <aaronmcadam> strip out the style rules you don't want
[14:54:50] <aaronmcadam> everything inherits
[14:54:53] <aaronmcadam> so...
[14:55:05] <etcetera> well that would make everything else not use those css styles.
[14:55:09] <etcetera> I'm talking about just for that element.
[14:55:11] <ccmonster> that css lib must have been a blast to build (or not..)
[14:55:20] <ccmonster> then just override it
[14:55:25] <mythril> what good collections style libs are out there?
[14:55:25] <aaronmcadam> it can be hard to customise tho
[14:55:32] <etcetera> ccmonster: how would I ovveride?
[14:55:37] <aaronmcadam> but then a little while in firebug sorts it out
[14:55:38] <etcetera> override*
[14:55:40] <ccmonster> #myspecialelement .ui-menu {my styles !important}
[14:55:47] <aaronmcadam> aaah
[14:55:51] <aaronmcadam> you arsehole :P
[14:55:57] <aaronmcadam> no, a better way
[14:56:04] <ccmonster> or skip the bang important and you prob okay
[14:56:07] <aaronmcadam> is to include your own css file AFTER the jquery ui one
[14:56:22] <aaronmcadam> that has higher specificity
[14:56:27] <ccmonster> it should work.
[14:56:30] <aaronmcadam> or else yes, prepend ids
[14:56:48] <ccmonster> I would probably just pre-pend + make sure it's after and your airtight then
[14:57:00] <aaronmcadam> whatever is maintainable
[14:57:07] <aaronmcadam> fucking !important rules are not
[14:57:14] <ccmonster> I'd rather not rely or file order and instead make the class just work.
[14:57:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah cool
[14:57:39] <ccmonster> !important sucks to do, but its a shim and shims are handy sometimes.
[14:57:51] <ccmonster> fake it till you make it I say :)
[14:57:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah great if you're working on your own
[14:58:03] <aaronmcadam> ...
[14:58:32] <ccmonster> file order proclusion = no bueno if you are managing someone elses code tho
[14:58:49] <aaronmcadam> !importants are just as bad there
[14:59:02] <ccmonster> Yes and no.
[14:59:17] <aaronmcadam> yeah it can turn a two sec change into a minefield
[14:59:19] <ccmonster> a bang important is probably more readily findable (as the bug), than file order in CSS
[14:59:37] <aaronmcadam> what if you're not aware of that "bug"
[14:59:46] <aaronmcadam> the amount of crap I see as "bug fixes"
[14:59:49] <ccmonster> well you know the symptom.
[14:59:54] <aaronmcadam> by people who don't kno what they're doing
[14:59:58] <ccmonster> debug the css via firebug and go.
[15:00:14] <aaronmcadam> yeah that's a great excuse :P
[15:00:20] <ccmonster> file order is outside the scope of 'most' css problem solving.
[15:00:35] <ckb> if I'm comparing a DOM element to 'this', would it fail if children exist/don't exist
[15:00:38] <aaronmcadam> aye but it *is* useful to see how the cascade is working
[15:00:51] <aaronmcadam> would make sense in this instance for dev
[15:01:00] <aaronmcadam> and see how your rules are overriding
[15:01:07] <ccmonster> yea. its always useful, and suggested
[15:01:09] <aaronmcadam> actually not a bad idea on theming
[15:01:27] <aaronmcadam> then save the file and remove the ui css
[15:01:31] <aaronmcadam> should work
[15:01:35] <aaronmcadam> or diff it
[15:01:41] <aaronmcadam> and merge
[15:01:50] <ccmonster> but if someone doesnt know how to override css themes, i'd almost want them to suffer through some broken inheritance lol
[15:02:02] <ccmonster> diff + merge = heaven.
[15:02:04] <aaronmcadam> if someone doesn't know
[15:02:13] <aaronmcadam> they need to learn
[15:02:23] <ccmonster> indeed. So break it and watch them learn lol
[15:02:24] <aaronmcadam> or stop being paid as professionals :P
[15:02:26] <ccmonster> sadistic, i know.
[15:02:37] <ccmonster> indeed.
[15:02:53] <aaronmcadam> it's the whole doctor who doesn't know basic medical shit anology
[15:03:08] <ccmonster> yea. Fundamentals get you a long way.
[15:03:17] <ccmonster> get your farther than much of the advanced stuff, honestly.
[15:03:26] <aaronmcadam> the worst is the js I have to refactor daily
[15:03:31] <aaronmcadam> so much shite code
[15:03:36] <ccmonster> I dont even want to discuss that.
[15:03:39] <aaronmcadam> lol
[15:03:45] <ccmonster> The JS i am looking at right now makes me want to tear up
[15:03:53] <aaronmcadam> you can see the guy just fighting with the language
[15:04:10] <ccmonster> Yea. i've been there. I've rigged some shit up that was supbar
[15:04:31] <ccmonster> ive done some substanrdard stuff that worked but wasn't 'elegant' but...good lord, some of this stuff...
[15:04:34] <ccmonster> makes you want to cry
[15:04:45] <aaronmcadam> rebecca murphy mentioned in her post about a quote about if you're happy with the code you wrote 6 months ago you're an idiot
[15:05:01] <ccmonster> straight functional js to the days end.
[15:05:08] <ccmonster> this shit makes me frustrated.
[15:05:20] <aaronmcadam> what do u mean
[15:05:25] <aaronmcadam> "straight functional"
[15:05:34] <ccmonster> yea, the only time ive been happy with code from 6 months ago is when it comes to helper functions that are pretty much boilerplate for a scenario
[15:05:52] <ccmonster> like, its just function after function after functions linked together with no actual data objects.
[15:05:54] <aaronmcadam> yeah I'm always looking for refactoring techniques
[15:06:04] <aaronmcadam> actually, need to checkout kangjax's new project
[15:06:09] <ccmonster> just strings passed to function after function
[15:06:42] <ccmonster> im a fan of the object literal technique. But that's because of legibility mainly
[15:07:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:07:16] <aaronmcadam> obj literals everywhere
[15:07:27] <aaronmcadam> $.extend() pattern
[15:07:31] <ccmonster> I havent got into the plugin mode much.
[15:07:33] <aaronmcadam> sensible defaults
[15:07:46] <aaronmcadam> nah I've actually never really had to write one
[15:07:48] <aaronmcadam> did once
[15:07:51] <adtaylor> is there a isObject function in jquery or is typeof safe enough to use cross browser?
[15:07:55] <ccmonster> yeap, pass the objects in as needed, sensisble default but extensive overrides if wanted
[15:08:01] <Lunders> heya guys, is it possible to do a AJAX send... and if it comes back correct set a session ?
[15:08:25] <ccmonster> TypeOf i believe.
[15:08:55] <aaronmcadam> it's a language construct
[15:08:58] <aaronmcadam> typeof
[15:09:08] <aaronmcadam> ?eval typeof [1,2]
[15:09:19] <aaronmcadam> ?g you alive botty bopy
[15:09:24] <aaronmcadam> goddammit
[15:09:54] <aaronmcadam> the bot is always down :(
[15:10:22] <ccmonster> indeed
[15:10:35] <ccmonster> i am having issues with the new jquery-ui-menu
[15:10:54] <ccmonster> and i need the 1.9 master build but i cant find it. gnarf  linked me to it yesterday on another machine and I cant find it.
[15:11:45] <aaronmcadam> fuckit!
[15:11:53] <aaronmcadam> what do u call the guy who wrote prototype?
[15:12:04] <aaronmcadam> kanjax? or something?
[15:12:07] <aaronmcadam> can't find him
[15:12:13] <ccmonster> cant rememeber
[15:12:34] <Bastian_b> Hi, I have a json string from an ajax call to a script and I would like to parse it, but I am not able to do it, the string is like : {"90": ["fukakai", "wewfwefwe"]}  could you help me please?
[15:12:36] <aaronmcadam> grr github doesn't list watched repos by added date
[15:12:52] <aaronmcadam> ?parseJSON
[15:13:11] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster: https://github.com/kangax/kratko.js
[15:13:15] <Bastian_b> I tried but I always have an error on jquery script
[15:13:16] <aaronmcadam> that's what I was looking for
[15:13:45] <aaronmcadam> you sure it's coming out as a string?
[15:13:46] <dabear> adtaylor: you can use $.type
[15:14:08] <aaronmcadam> how is that diff to typeof dabear?
[15:14:20] <dabear> somewhat
[15:14:22] <aaronmcadam> or does it cast to a type?
[15:14:30] <aaronmcadam> ie a number object to Number?
[15:14:36] <dabear> tpyeof fails for objects in iframes, fe.x.
[15:14:38] <aaronmcadam> never used it
[15:14:49] <DofLeFou> Anyone knows of a good Jquery plugin that does Pagination and Filter for Table
[15:14:55] <aaronmcadam> you'd probably just get Object
[15:15:03] <aaronmcadam> jPaginate maybe]
[15:15:10] <aaronmcadam> Data tables plugin was good
[15:15:24] <DofLeFou> url
[15:15:29] <aaronmcadam> DofLeFou: http://www.datatables.net/
[15:15:34] <adtaylor> dabear : perfect, thanks a heap!
[15:16:23] <ccmonster> data tables looked solid last time i looked
[15:16:50] <DofLeFou> let me give that a try and see
[15:18:33] <aaronmcadam> yeah I vaguely remember wrestling with it's api
[15:18:46] <aaronmcadam> for doing something stupid with ajax probably
[15:18:53] <Bastian_b> I have changed the json to [ ["fukakai", "wewfwefwe"], ["fukakai", "wewfwefwe"], ["fukakai", "wewfwefwe"]
[15:19:04] <Bastian_b> anybody knozs how to parse that please?
[15:19:11] <aaronmcadam> does it pass json lint
[15:19:22] <aaronmcadam> there's no keys there
[15:19:33] <aaronmcadam> that's just 3 arrays one after the other
[15:19:55] <Bastian_b> yes and I want to loop over arrays
[15:20:12] <aaronmcadam> Parse error on line 4:
[15:20:12] <aaronmcadam> ...",    "wewfwefwe"],[    "fukakai",
[15:20:12] <aaronmcadam> ---------------------^
[15:20:12] <aaronmcadam> Expecting 'EOF'
[15:20:17] <aaronmcadam> http://jsonlint.com/
[15:20:27] <aaronmcadam> it's not valid json
[15:20:35] <aaronmcadam> give it keys
[15:20:39] <Bastian_b> missing ] at the end
[15:20:50] <aaronmcadam> 0 : [ 'fukadka', 'idfidf' ]
[15:21:04] <Bastian_b> its like it was previously
[15:21:13] <aaronmcadam> yes
[15:21:18] <aaronmcadam> looks ok now but still
[15:21:19] <Bastian_b> the key was an id, but still getting error from jauery script
[15:21:37] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle it
[15:21:57] <aaronmcadam> over to mr coyier: http://css-tricks.com/13414-seriously-just-make-a-jsfiddle/
[15:22:00] <ColKurtz> I usually like to use jquery cycle for my slideshows, but I'm making a simple gallery and rather than have the HTML marked up as a bunch of a <img /> tags and the plugin generating the thumbnail links, I would prefer to have it marked up as a bunch of links to the full-size images. Does anybody have a favorite gallery plugin that works like I'm describing?
[15:22:03] <ccmonster> yea, that's not valid.
[15:22:16] <aaronmcadam> it is but it's horribly unreadable heh
[15:22:26] <ccmonster> hmm..
[15:22:27] <ccmonster> interesting.
[15:22:55] <Bastian_b> I have this now {"93": ["bastian", "fwefwe"],"93": ["bastian", "fwefwe"]}
[15:23:01] <Bastian_b> validated =)
[15:23:14] <ccmonster> yay :)
[15:23:20] <Bastian_b> do you know how can i loop on it?
[15:23:28] <aaronmcadam> parse it
[15:23:59] <aaronmcadam> $.each ( string.parseJSON(), function ( index, element ) { .. } );
[15:24:02] <Bastian_b> I would like but I don't know how...
[15:24:14] <Bastian_b> It does not work at all already tried
[15:24:21] <aaronmcadam> use jsfiddle please
[15:24:31] <Bastian_b> what it is?
[15:24:36] <aaronmcadam> read the post...
[15:24:45] <aaronmcadam> over to mr coyier: http://css-tricks.com/13414-seriously-just-make-a-jsfiddle/
[15:24:51] <Bastian_b> oki thanks
[15:24:59] <ccmonster> hah chris coyier is a funny guy :0
[15:25:06] <aaronmcadam> thank god he wrote that article
[15:25:12] <aaronmcadam> everyone in here should read that
[15:25:35] <aaronmcadam> spend an inordinate amount of time helping people with jsfiddle as well their bloody problems lol
[15:25:35] <Ogredude> if I'm using Rails to render a partial into my javascript before it gets shipped back off to the user, as part of an xhr request, how do I manage the multiple lines of output?
[15:25:51] <aaronmcadam> you're doing it as an XHR? :O
[15:25:58] <Ogredude> I figured out how to do it if the template only renders one line of text, but I need a template that'll render several lines of text and it's interrupting the javascript.
[15:26:13] <aaronmcadam> yea
[15:26:15] <aaronmcadam> use json
[15:26:27] <Ogredude> aaronmcadam:  can you link to that article you were talking about?
[15:26:36] <aaronmcadam> about jsfiddle?
[15:26:40] <Ogredude> no, because the result of the request needs to fade out the link, replace it, and fade it back in
[15:26:48] <aaronmcadam> what?
[15:26:51] <Ogredude> it's being replaced by the contents of a Rails partial template
[15:26:52] <aaronmcadam> the result??
[15:27:01] <Ogredude> alright, back up
[15:27:04] <aaronmcadam> don't tell me you're pulling in js with ajax
[15:27:04] <ccmonster> on the success from the $.ajax requestion do all the fadeing and stuff
[15:27:08] <Ogredude> here's how it works
[15:27:15] <ccmonster> oh god!
[15:27:20] <ckb> what would cause form_build_id to not change even when $form_state['rebuild'] is true?
[15:27:21] <ccmonster> noaXess, no no , say it aint so
[15:27:22] <maqr> hey Ogredude :P
[15:27:24] <aaronmcadam> idiotooo
[15:27:31] <aaronmcadam> haha!
[15:27:33] <aaronmcadam> that's a good one!
[15:27:39] <Ogredude> user clicks link.  it submits as an asynchronous request. The Rails controller Does Some Stuff.  The browser receives the javascript that tells it to fade out the link, replace it, fade it back in.
[15:27:45] <aaronmcadam> what would cause form_build_id to not change even when $form_state['rebuild'] is true?
[15:27:52] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[15:27:52] <Ogredude> maqr ftw!
[15:27:54] <maqr> :P
[15:28:15] <aaronmcadam> what would cause a random var nobody has any idea about to not change?
[15:28:17] <Ogredude> aaronmcadam:  and link that article please
[15:28:20] <ccmonster> so you are sending back js via your AJAX requestion?
[15:28:22] <aaronmcadam> what article?
[15:28:36] <Bastian_b> nothing happens running the fiddle post
[15:28:37] <aaronmcadam> Ogredude: don't do it that way
[15:28:43] <Ogredude> aaronmcadam:  the one you said everyone should read
[15:28:46] <ccmonster> yea, please DONT do it that way.
[15:28:49] <aaronmcadam> that's the point Bastian_b post the url
[15:28:51] <ccmonster> that was with regard to jsfiddle.
[15:29:01] <aaronmcadam> over to mr coyier: http://css-tricks.com/13414-seriously-just-make-a-jsfiddle/
[15:29:25] <ccmonster> repost your fiddle Bastian_b
[15:29:27] <maqr> does anyone know what $.ajaxPrefilter is supposed to return? is it always options.success?
[15:29:39] <aaronmcadam> Ogredude: js you get from an ajax request is NOT executed
[15:29:56] <aaronmcadam> just stick to that
[15:29:58] <Ogredude> ok then what's the one that's not ajax that executes the js you get back?
[15:30:00] <Bastian_b> http://jsfiddle.net/z5CqC/
[15:30:03] <Ogredude> because that's the one I'm using.
[15:30:14] <aaronmcadam> the callback?
[15:30:18] <Ogredude> whatever
[15:30:24] <aaronmcadam> don't whatever me boyo :P
[15:30:26] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[15:30:28] <aaronmcadam> anyway
[15:30:30] <Ogredude> user clicks link. Rails does some stuff and sends back some javascript. Javascript gets executed.
[15:30:31] <Bastian_b> on mide side "data.parseJSON() is not a function "
[15:30:34] <Ogredude> that is what I need to happen.
[15:30:45] <aaronmcadam> don't put ANY js in that partial you are calling
[15:30:49] * ccmonster tears at sending JS via a xhr
[15:30:51] <aaronmcadam> remove that whole line
[15:30:53] <Ogredude> I don't really care at this point what the hell it's called, I just want to freakin do it
[15:30:55] <maqr> Ogredude: as far as i know, you shouldn't be sending back javascript ever
[15:31:00] <aaronmcadam> asnd replace it with this sentence
[15:31:03] <maqr> Ogredude: eval() lol?
[15:31:09] <aaronmcadam> Rails does some stuff  AND DOES NOT send back some javascript
[15:31:25] <maqr> it should send back json, ideally
[15:31:31] <aaronmcadam> Ogredude: you're not gonna get help with that attitude
[15:31:32] <ccmonster> that is such a security and application liability Ogredude .
[15:31:41] <aaronmcadam> we are not here to write your code for you
[15:31:47] <aaronmcadam> remember that
[15:31:51] <Lunders> heya guys, is it possible to do a AJAX send... and if it comes back correct set a session ?
[15:32:01] <ccmonster> take the chunk of code you are sending, place it in the success of your $.ajax call, and move along
[15:32:04] <aaronmcadam> nevermind the security, your code isn't guaranteed to run
[15:32:07] <maqr> Lunders: settings are server-side things
[15:32:17] <maqr> *sessions
[15:32:21] <Ogredude>  goddamnit, I ask a simple goddamn question and I'm getting grief about it
[15:32:35] <maqr> aaronmcadam: if you're looking for a good question, i've got one :)
[15:32:39] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[15:32:41] <ccmonster> we are trying to help, albeit ribbing you along the way, but because we are trying to make a point.
[15:32:53] <ccmonster> dont pass around javascript like normal data obj
[15:32:57] <Lunders> maqr: if I do it in my PHP page which the ajax gets sent to ... would that work ?
[15:33:00] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster++
[15:33:08] <aaronmcadam> what's up maqr
[15:33:16] <maqr> aaronmcadam: $.ajaxPrefilter doesn't have any mention in the documentaiton on what the callback should return... and if i return 'options.success', it seems to "work", but i have no idea why
[15:33:40] <aaronmcadam> did u inspect it in firebug
[15:33:49] <ccmonster> Ogredude, if you are passing the JS back from RoR, you've already written the code you want to execute, therefore take it, put it in the success: or complete: piece of your $.ajax call in jquery
[15:33:56] <aaronmcadam> I've never used that func but I'm imagining if you just log the object and look
[15:33:59] <maqr> Lunders: eh? your server is going to set a cookie, your browser will replay that cookie to the server, that's how your server knows what sessions are
[15:34:09] <aaronmcadam> lemme look
[15:34:11] <maqr> aaronmcadam: i don't even know what i'd inspect
[15:34:19] <aaronmcadam> why are u using it then?
[15:34:31] <aaronmcadam> or just curious?
[15:34:48] <maqr> aaronmcadam: because i need to make changes to options.headers before every xhr is sent
[15:35:06] <aaronmcadam> maqr: handler(options, originalOptions, jqXHR) )
[15:35:09] <maqr> aaronmcadam: you'd think the return value of the callback would have nothing to do with that... but if i don't return options.success, it seems like it just dies somehow
[15:35:14] <maqr> aaronmcadam: yes, i'm there, but what does the handler return?
[15:35:15] <ccmonster> you can do that in the beforeSend i htink
[15:35:18] <ccmonster> or there are other places.
[15:35:32] <aaronmcadam> ah hmm
[15:35:36] <maqr> aaronmcadam: i don't know what the return value for that handler is supposed to be
[15:35:40] <maqr> that's the handler that i'm using
[15:35:43] <Ogredude> ccmonster:  but the stuff that needs to be replaced has some bits that Rails needs to fill in
[15:35:55] <ccmonster> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ - there is a headers piece
[15:35:59] <aaronmcadam> gotcha maqr
[15:36:10] <gnarf> ccmonster: http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js
[15:36:10] <aaronmcadam> he wants to set it globally i think dude
[15:36:11] <Ogredude> the way I've got it wired up now, the link makes a remote PUT request, Rails does some stuff and sends back some JS which gets executed
[15:36:15] <Ogredude> is this not the right way to do things/
[15:36:17] <Ogredude> ?
[15:36:26] <ccmonster> well, then send JUST the elements you need to change (not in js form) and replace it in your js code
[15:36:30] <Ogredude> because if it's not, then there are a hell of a lot of Rails tutorials out there that are dead freakin wrong.
[15:36:31] <aaronmcadam> that is not the right way Ogredude
[15:36:35] <Bastian_b> PERFECT I found out the solution ! thqnks guys
[15:36:40] <maqr> aaronmcadam: if i return "options.success" or "jqXHR", it seems to run fine... but if i return "foo", it breaks the ajax call
[15:36:45] <ccmonster> thanks gnarf , i ended up drinking a mt. dew, getting some minor brain functionality and finding it lol . Thanks again mang!
[15:36:47] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[15:36:52] <aaronmcadam> seems like a hole in the docs
[15:36:53] <maqr> ccmonster: yeah, i need it before *every* xhr, it's for authentication
[15:36:59] <ajpiano> Ogredude: not using callbacks and sending back snippets of js to be executed is indeed not considered a good development practise
[15:37:00] <aaronmcadam> raise it in #jquery-dev
[15:37:03] <aaronmcadam> I'm looking tho
[15:37:14] <ajpiano> API docs don't cover application structure best practises
[15:37:16] <aaronmcadam> hiya adam, thanks for weighing in :)
[15:37:21] <ccmonster> what ajpiano said :)
[15:37:26] <Ogredude> I would love the ability to find current and relevant documentation, and be able to weed out the outdated and just plain wrong stuff.
[15:37:32] <aaronmcadam> I'm talking about prefilter adam :)
[15:37:41] <ajpiano> oh
[15:38:03] <maqr> aaronmcadam: i asked in #jquery-dev
[15:38:04] <aaronmcadam> hey maqr maybe you have to return the options you are overwriting?
[15:38:04] <Ogredude> I built this thing based on 3 or 4 tutorials plus a railscast or two.  Apparently they are all wrong, then.
[15:38:11] <maqr> aaronmcadam: maybe, but it's not obvious
[15:38:19] <aaronmcadam> sure isn't
[15:38:28] <maqr> aaronmcadam: return {} actually seems to "work" too
[15:38:37] <ajpiano> i don't think you have to return anything from the prefilter
[15:38:40] <ajpiano> you just modify the options
[15:38:43] <maqr> aaronmcadam: but i know the return value is used somewhere because "return 'string'" causes ajax to break
[15:38:45] <ajpiano> that you want to modify
[15:38:47] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[15:39:04] <zeroxdc> Is it possible to have multiple autocomplete widgets on a page?
[15:39:18] <maqr> ajpiano: that's what i'm looking at
[15:39:18] <aaronmcadam> i think he wants to modify it globally adam
[15:39:29] <aaronmcadam> am i with you maqr?
[15:39:35] <maqr> yes, i want to modify *every* xhr
[15:39:43] <aaronmcadam> good good
[15:39:43] <maqr> i'm adding an Authorization header
[15:39:52] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[15:39:58] <ajpiano> that's what the prefilter is for... the function gets run on every ajax call
[15:40:04] <ccmonster> i see.
[15:40:07] <maqr> ajpiano: yeah, but it does something with the return value, and i don't know what
[15:40:14] <maqr> ajpiano: return {} == success... return "foo" == explodes
[15:40:14] <ajpiano> why are you returning anything at all
[15:40:19] <Ogredude> well bloody hell
[15:40:30] <Ogredude> I guess it's time to disassemble my working code and redo it. Again.
[15:40:31] <ccmonster> i thought it just alters the options as part of the overall ajax call
[15:40:43] <aaronmcadam> Ogredude: all part of learning process dude
[15:40:44] <ccmonster> it applies to them all right?
[15:40:51] <ajpiano> exactly ccmonster
[15:40:55] <maqr> i think it does other stuff too
[15:40:56] <Ogredude> it'd be really freakin nice if I could back this javascript stuff up with a testing suite.  I can't make heads or tails out of any of the testing systems that I've seen.
[15:41:04] <aaronmcadam> Jasmine?
[15:41:07] <aaronmcadam> QUnit?
[15:41:18] <ccmonster> Qunit or w/e
[15:41:20] <Ogredude> can't figure out how to apply them to *my* stuff
[15:41:24] <ccmonster> aaronmcadam ++
[15:41:28] <aaronmcadam> well yeah that's the problem
[15:41:29] <aaronmcadam> heh
[15:41:35] <aaronmcadam> learning that part myself
[15:41:40] <Ogredude> jasmine's pretty nice, I went through several tutorials, but it's still not clear how to test the stuff *I* wanna test
[15:41:45] <ccmonster> testing is strange to me in JS, thus far.
[15:41:46] <ajpiano> Ogredude: i think you might be trying to do the type of testing that is better suited to selenium or something
[15:41:57] <ajpiano> Ogredude, or come to jqcon and listen to the talks on testing :p
[15:42:01] <aaronmcadam> iMacros are good too
[15:42:19] <ccmonster> ahah ajpiano , baptism by fire there :)
[15:42:23] <Ogredude> selenium's not going to work in our environment, and capybara-webkit can't interact with a JQuery UI autocomplete field.
[15:42:32] <chrisbovard> I already asked. I could not get it going. How do I on a select.change submit the form (i want to hide the form submit button)? - http://jsfiddle.net/qVG9N/
[15:42:34] <aaronmcadam> have you tried iMacro?
[15:43:00] <aaronmcadam> it's pretty ok, it's scriptable too
[15:43:05] <ccmonster> chrisbovard, we covered this..
[15:43:09] <ccmonster> whats the prob now?
[15:43:45] <aaronmcadam> Ogredude: http://www.iopus.com/imacros/firefox/
[15:44:05] <chrisbovard> i can see the select.. but the .submit is not firing
[15:44:11] <chrisbovard> or submiting the form
[15:44:18] <aaronmcadam> selector correct?
[15:44:30] <ccmonster> fiddle please
[15:44:35] <maqr> ccmonster: i'm pretty sure this return value is used somewhere, i'm going to read the source
[15:44:39] <chrisbovard> yes.. the alert pops up when the selector is changed
[15:45:12] <ccmonster> i assume it is used by the ajax handler no? I'm missing what youre issue is with the return..
[15:45:18] <aaronmcadam> some redheaded dude did this site chrisbovard, have a look
[15:45:19] <aaronmcadam> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide61
[15:45:23] <ccmonster> let me know what you find out thouse
[15:46:05] <aaronmcadam> pity console.log() doesn't show an alert() tho :(
[15:46:55] <aaronmcadam> ah are you guys asleep or something heh
[15:47:24] <ccmonster> i HATE alert.
[15:47:26] <ccmonster> just me though :)
[15:47:35] <chrisbovard> here is the code ccmonster http://jsfiddle.net/qVG9N/1/
[15:47:44] <ccmonster> i love the 'stacktrace or GTFO' slide
[15:47:46] <aaronmcadam> I was jokinh ccmonster
[15:47:46] <ccmonster> just for the title haha
[15:47:56] <aaronmcadam> was waiting for the WTFFFS
[15:48:05] <ccmonster> haha
[15:48:06] <chrisbovard> ccmonster, there is not ajax.. just a form submit.. i need to hide the button
[15:48:14] <chrisbovard> but submit the form on select change
[15:48:21] <ccmonster> $('form button').hide();
[15:48:32] <ccmonster> or just DONT have a button at all in the first place
[15:48:34] <chrisbovard> i can hide the button easy..
[15:49:00] <chrisbovard> it is making the select. change do the submit when it is changed
[15:49:07] <aaronmcadam> chrisbovard:
[15:49:13] <aaronmcadam> have you jsfiddled it yet?
[15:49:17] <ccmonster> you are doing most of it.
[15:49:21] <chrisbovard> i have http://jsfiddle.net/qVG9N/1/
[15:49:22] <ccmonster> he just posted the fiddle aaronmcadam
[15:49:28] <aaronmcadam> ah
[15:49:44] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:49:54] <aaronmcadam> love the way almost everybody sets the libraries as mootools
[15:50:00] <aaronmcadam> i.e.forgets to change the defaults
[15:50:06] <chrisbovard> if this is not sorry
[15:50:09] <chrisbovard> sorry
[15:50:16] <ccmonster> yea, change the lib and your good lol
[15:50:24] <aaronmcadam> chrisbovard: no worries, what do u want to do?
[15:50:25] <ccmonster> i didnt even catch that at first.
[15:50:31] <aaronw-1> if you pass in an html tag to $.append, is the object that is appended to the DOM include the closing tag?
[15:50:35] <ccmonster> he wants to submit the form on selectbox.change
[15:50:44] <chrisbovard> i hate mootools http://jsfiddle.net/qVG9N/3/
[15:50:47] <aaronmcadam> yeh it works
[15:50:53] <aaronw-1> i.e, .append ("<option">) actually ends up appending <option></option> ?
[15:51:04] <ccmonster> no
[15:51:21] <ccmonster> but appent($("<a></a>")) will actaully create an object
[15:51:27] <ccmonster> append*
[15:51:28] <aaronw-1> what about:
[15:51:30] <aaronmcadam> self closing divs will work
[15:51:43] <ccmonster> and your quotes are all off
[15:51:44] <ccmonster> but yea
[15:51:46] <aaronw-1> $("#test").append($("<option>").text(data2).prop("value",data2));
[15:51:55] <aaronmcadam> i.e. $( '<div />');
[15:52:10] <aaronw-1> a </option> magically appears
[15:52:16] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:52:32] <aaronmcadam> a better way is this
[15:52:49] <aaronw-1> am I stumbling over the difference between $.append("<option>") and $.append($("<option")) ?
[15:52:49] <aaronmcadam> $("#test").append($("<option>", { text : data2, value : data }):
[15:53:16] <aaronmcadam> well the $ creates the element
[15:53:25] <aaronw-1> right
[15:53:25] <aaronmcadam> the first one there is just the string "<option>"
[15:53:26] <ccmonster> yea.
[15:53:35] <brettgoulder> aaronw-1, you want the wrap method
[15:53:36] <ccmonster> create the element, so you have acecss to all of its properties
[15:53:41] <aaronmcadam> that's where you're falling down
[15:53:52] <aaronw-1> brettgoulder - ?
[15:53:55] <aaronw-1> ccmonster, right
[15:53:57] <aaronmcadam> if you do it the way i said, u can remove those 2 methods too
[15:54:01] <aaronw-1> I got where I put the text and value in
[15:54:06] <brettgoulder> aaronw-1, http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[15:54:09] <aaronw-1> I'm just not sure where the </option> comes from
[15:54:13] <ccmonster> yea, and you can even set the css all slick like using the same sort of syntax
[15:54:18] <Danny_Joris> Hi all, I want to set a time out at an .each function, but it's not working. I've tried lots of options... http://jsfiddle.net/Danny_Joris/J9skd/82/
[15:54:27] <aaronmcadam> it's the dom el you get it for free basically
[15:54:32] <Danny_Joris> the $("#slider .next").click(function() { function
[15:54:38] <ccmonster> .css({display:'block',font-size:'10px'}) etc etc
[15:54:38] <aaronw-1> aaronmcadam - el ?
[15:54:46] <aaronmcadam> I always try to stay away from that and use classes tho ccmonster
[15:54:57] <aaronmcadam> css adds inline styles remember
[15:55:03] <brettgoulder> aaronw-1,  I imagine your web inspector is trying to be smart and match unclosed tags
[15:55:04] <ccmonster> yes, I know.
[15:55:13] <aaronmcadam> aaronw-1: el === element
[15:55:16] <ccmonster> the syntax is more what im trying to teach
[15:55:23] <ccmonster> and that it applies to more than this instance.
[15:55:26] <aaronw-1> aaronmcadam  - understood
[15:55:38] <aaronmcadam> aye i try to do both at the same time :D
[15:55:40] <aaronw-1> brettgoulder - I looked at it in firebug and there is the </option> in the HTML explorer in there
[15:55:57] <aaronmcadam> you're creating the actual element
[15:55:57] <ccmonster> html explorer?
[15:55:58] <aaronmcadam> that's why
[15:55:59] <ccmonster> what browser?
[15:55:59] <aaronw-1> are you saying that it actually isn't emitting the /option (it=jquery) but something else is putting it in to be helpful?
[15:56:05] <aaronmcadam> yeah the html tab in firebug he means ccmonster
[15:56:12] <ccmonster> ok. phew.
[15:56:16] <brettgoulder> aaronw-1, right, that's what i'm saying
[15:56:18] <aaronw-1> yeah the html tab
[15:56:20] <aaronmcadam> it *should* be jquery creating the actual dom node
[15:56:27] <aaronw-1> sorry, lack of precision on my part
[15:56:48] <brettgoulder> aaronw-1, if you truly wanted to wrap a tag around something, you would use the wrap method
[15:56:51] <ccmonster> and its faster to create and alter the object before actually appending it to the dom
[15:56:55] <aaronmcadam> but the guys are right the browser can sometimes create stuff for you
[15:57:03] <aaronw-1> brettgoulder , ok, thanks.. that makes a little more sense, I was getting a little confused
[15:57:03] <ccmonster> especially if doing <ul><li> stuf
[15:57:20] <ccmonster> and having to create multiple items and looping throough
[15:57:33] <ccmonster> than doing the string representation that is.
[15:57:37] <aaronw-1> brettgoulder - I do want to wrap option /option around the text, but each of the <option> tags needs a value= prop though
[15:58:10] <ccmonster> $('option,{text:'mytext',value:'1'}) etc
[15:58:10] <aaronw-1> so wrap it and then add prop value to each element?
[15:58:25] <ccmonster> you can just do it in one pass, like aaronmcadam and I mentioned
[15:58:34] <aaronw-1> if I do it all at one time I get confused :(
[15:58:35] <ccmonster> you can create the object and set all its properties in one go
[15:58:41] <ccmonster> haha, it's easier than you think
[15:58:57] <aaronmcadam> aw hehe
[15:58:58] <aaronw-1> I'm sure you could write one line of code for this too:
[15:59:01] <ccmonster> feel free to do it in 2 lines if you wish, but you'll quickly adapt to one
[15:59:19] <ccmonster> w/e makes it comfy for you man, as long as you do it right, and working
[15:59:27] <aaronw-1> .getJSON("populaterp.php",function(data){ $.each(data,function(data1, data2) {$("#ioschoose").append($("<option>").text(data2).prop("value",data2)); }); });
[15:59:44] <aaronmcadam> dude
[15:59:51] <aaronw-1> don't yell at me!
[15:59:52] <aaronmcadam> data1, data2 are misleading var nbames thjere
[15:59:55] <aaronmcadam> ha!
[15:59:58] <aaronw-1> I program routers, not javascript!
[16:00:01] <aaronmcadam> didn't mean to
[16:00:05] <aaronw-1> I am kidding
[16:00:08] <aaronmcadam> :D
[16:00:09] <aaronw-1> I know my code is suck
[16:00:16] <aaronmcadam> index, value should be the names
[16:00:24] <aaronmcadam> just easier for u when u come back to look at the code later
[16:00:29] <aaronw-1> understood
[16:00:38] <aaronmcadam> just a maintenance tip
[16:00:47] <aaronmcadam> you'll thank yourself later believe me
[16:01:02] <ccmonster> you can use .attr('propname','value') as well
[16:01:12] <ccmonster> i do believe.
[16:01:13] <aaronw-1> I thought .prop was more better
[16:01:19] <ccmonster> could be. im not sure
[16:01:20] <aaronmcadam> emm
[16:01:24] <aaronmcadam> you're getting confused
[16:01:29] <aaronw-1> probably!
[16:01:30] <aaronmcadam> prop is what the browser interprets
[16:01:35] <ajpiano> you should use... val() for setting the value....
[16:01:37] <aaronmcadam> ie the DOM properties
[16:01:39] <ccmonster> i think they all attr form a jquery standpoint
[16:01:46] <ccmonster> hell if i know.
[16:01:47] <ajpiano> ccmonster: not as of jquery 1.6
[16:01:53] <ccmonster> ah. well there ya go
[16:01:57] <aaronmcadam> yep
[16:01:58] <ccmonster> whats the dilly now?
[16:02:04] <aaronmcadam> it was a pretty big change ya kno, keep up :P
[16:02:12] <ccmonster> haha. im trying im trying
[16:02:16] <aaronmcadam> only messing! :D
[16:02:26] <ccmonster> i'm rebuilding this POS and using 1.6.2 but havent run into man legacy issues.
[16:02:35] <ccmonster> many*
[16:02:38] <aaronmcadam> it was to separate out the computed DOM properties from the actual HTML attrs ccmonster
[16:02:59] <ccmonster> hmm.
[16:03:04] <ccmonster> sweet, i guess lol
[16:03:17] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:03:21] <etcetera> man overriding jquery ui styles is a PITA.
[16:03:26] <aaronmcadam> it's an important distinction really I spose
[16:03:47] <aaronmcadam> what do u mean POS? point of sale?
[16:03:55] <aaronmcadam> piece of shit!
[16:03:56] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[16:05:03] <aaronmcadam> i've thrown away a load of code on this project
[16:05:37] <ccmonster> PITA = pain in the ass
[16:05:38] <aaronmcadam> I deal with sites with 1700 lines of shite code in the source :D
[16:05:40] <aaronmcadam> great fun
[16:05:51] <aaronmcadam> and *some* externalised "libraries"
[16:06:15] <aaronw-1> or I suppose I should just use a selectbox plugin
[16:06:15] <ccmonster> yea, and those 1700 lines would be much more legible and maintable with 800 lines of not even 'elegant' code
[16:06:16] <aaronmcadam> some using prototypal inheritance, some "jquery plugins" that aren't plugins at all...
[16:06:24] <ccmonster> why do you need selectbox plugin?
[16:06:45] <ccmonster> prototype ftw :)
[16:06:45] <ccmonster> lol
[16:07:03] <ccmonster> whats requiring the selectbox plugin aaronw-1 ?
[16:07:11] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: you tried this kratko project yet?
[16:07:27] <aaronmcadam> "Simple tool to help refactor Javascript" https://github.com/kangax/kratko.js
[16:07:30] <ajpiano> haven't
[16:07:36] <aaronmcadam> really wanna give it a go
[16:07:45] <aaronmcadam> actually used a bb model today
[16:07:48] <aaronmcadam> woot
[16:07:48] <aaronmcadam> :D
[16:08:13] <aaronmcadam> realised I'd been abusing my views
[16:09:37] <ccmonster> what ide or editer do you use aaronmcadam
[16:09:50] <aaronmcadam> pycharm ccmonster
[16:10:14] <ccmonster> for everything?
[16:10:21] <aaronmcadam> tho I've seemed to have lost some of the cool js inter-file navigation I had before I got a new poc
[16:10:23] <aaronmcadam> pc*
[16:10:25] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:10:30] <aaronmcadam> gedit for quick opens
[16:10:33] <aaronmcadam> meld for diffs

[16:10:55] <ccmonster> ah|, how you like mint?
[16:11:08] <aaronmcadam> it's way better than it used to be, and ubuntu
[16:11:08] <ccmonster> if i didnt have to do so much fucking excel shit for other people i'd be back on linux in a split
[16:11:18] <aaronmcadam> just run a vm
[16:11:24] <aaronmcadam> with a half decent machine
[16:11:25] <ccmonster> Naw, this machien aint beast enough
[16:11:35] <aaronmcadam> 8gig i5
[16:11:37] <ccmonster> I need a new beast to tame.
[16:11:38] <aaronmcadam> I'm on
[16:11:39] <ccmonster> FUCK YOU lol
[16:11:42] <aaronmcadam> hahah :D
[16:11:53] <ccmonster> im on like, a 2 yr old dell inspiron
[16:11:53] <aaronmcadam> it's awesome :) not that expensive either
[16:11:59] <aaronmcadam> well when it's free ...
[16:12:08] <aaronmcadam> fuck man how do u get *anything* done
[16:12:18] <ccmonster> im not a mac fan, but i'd take a new macbook
[16:12:25] <ccmonster> that they have given the FUCKING marketind dept
[16:12:30] * ccmonster scuse me while i weep
[16:12:31] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster: http://www.dell.com/uk/business/p/latitude-e5520/pd.aspx?c=uk&cs=ukbsdt1&l=en&s=bsd&~ck=mn&ST=+dell%20+latitude%20+E5520&dgc=ST&cid=41142&lid=1069631&acd=12383993192056164
[16:13:03] <ccmonster> hows the nix support on that machine?
[16:13:09] <aaronmcadam> pretty good
[16:13:11] <aaronmcadam> if u use mint
[16:13:16] <ccmonster> why ...if?
[16:13:19] <aaronmcadam> ubuntu's drivers are shite for sandybridge
[16:13:25] <aaronmcadam> you need the PAE kernel
[16:13:26] <ccmonster> Ah.
[16:13:32] <aaronmcadam> and I installed 64bit like a twat
[16:13:49] <aaronmcadam> so go 32bit mint and everything's handy
[16:13:52] <ccmonster> what else would you install
[16:13:55] <ccmonster> i like 64
[16:14:02] <austen> Ugh... I'm coding all my web shit in Bluefish and it sucks...
[16:14:06] <aaronmcadam> yeah but PAE uses all your ram anyway
[16:14:16] <ccmonster> I HATE bluefish
[16:14:22] <aaronmcadam> eeeesh
[16:14:24] <austen> Wish I was better in emacs
[16:14:25] <aaronmcadam> bluefish?
[16:14:26] <ccmonster> yea, it takes double the ram usually
[16:14:28] <aaronmcadam> u must hate yourself
[16:14:34] <ccmonster> geany is better
[16:14:40] <ccmonster> more like..um..notepad++
[16:14:43] <aaronmcadam> depends on what u want
[16:14:44] <ccmonster> there are others..
[16:14:54] <austen> Yeah, it would be *awesome* if PHP was the *one* syntax hilighting missing from codeblocks...
[16:14:57] <aaronmcadam> pycharm's debugging is amazing for massive projects
[16:15:02] <ccmonster> you can alway just install aptana
[16:15:06] <aaronmcadam> yeh
[16:15:07] <ccmonster> or a full eclipse ide
[16:15:09] <aaronmcadam> they took out a lot tho
[16:15:12] <aaronmcadam> with the new version
[16:15:18] <ccmonster> out alot of what from what /
[16:15:24] <aaronmcadam> if you're a django dev, pycharm is awesome
[16:15:29] <aaronmcadam> it's js features are good too tho
[16:15:37] <ccmonster> i dont do a lot of django, but i dig it
[16:15:40] <aaronmcadam> but i think that's inhertied from intelliJ
[16:15:50] <ccmonster> pycharm built of intellij?
[16:16:01] <aaronmcadam> it auto intellisenses your custom libraries
[16:16:10] <aaronmcadam> partly, based on eclipse
[16:16:14] <aaronmcadam> but heavily modified
[16:16:30] <ccmonster> interesting.
[16:16:33] <aaronmcadam> it's file nav is awesome tho
[16:16:41] <ccmonster> aptana does the trick usually.
[16:16:41] <aaronmcadam> clicking through to see implementing functions
[16:16:48] <aaronmcadam> I used to use that all the time
[16:16:58] <aaronmcadam> but pydev is shit compared to pycharm really
[16:17:08] <ccmonster> If you have some horses under the hood on your machine, aptana is grreat
[16:17:11] <aaronmcadam> tho pycharm uses some bits n pieces from pydev
[16:17:37] <ccmonster> then again, a custom Eclipse install is probably jsut as good. But it takes some effort just to get to the aptana level
[16:17:53] <ccmonster> but since i do java, groovy/grails, it's nice having just ONe ide if i can help it
[16:17:57] <rns> I have a table that is dynamically generated and can have between 1 and 50 columns.  I'd like to display up to 10 columns and then if there are more columns create a line break and display the next 10 columns (repeating the break if there are more than 20 total columns).  Is there a way to do this with jquery?
[16:18:01] <aaronmcadam> yeah and the fact that the whole project is unavoidably biased towards ruby
[16:18:07] <aaronw-1> I don't hate bluefish
[16:18:11] <aaronmcadam> ha same question as earlier
[16:18:15] <aaronmcadam> datatables.org rns
[16:18:26] <aaronw-1> aaronmcadam - datatables.net you mean
[16:18:27] <aaronmcadam> i used to like kate at uni
[16:18:29] <ccmonster> data table is ggrreat
[16:18:31] <aaronmcadam> aye whateves
[16:18:34] <austen> Ok... Downloading Aptana.. I'll give ANYTHING a try... I love these little bugs in Bluefish where you can switch documents, the interface appears to be frozen, but really, you're just mucking up your previously opened file without realizing it...
[16:18:48] <ccmonster> that's awesome!
[16:18:49] <aaronmcadam> austen how much ram do u have
[16:18:49] <aaronw-1> what is like bluefish, but not as hate filled?
[16:18:57] <ccmonster> geany
[16:19:04] <aaronmcadam> gedit does the job
[16:19:09] <aaronmcadam> if u install the plugin packs
[16:19:11] <ccmonster> geany is my low-fi text of choice, with gedit a 2nd
[16:19:17] <aaronmcadam> you can get it quite decent
[16:19:20] <austen> Makes me a bit nervous that it isn't available in apt repository yet...
[16:19:24] <aaronmcadam> integrated terminal and file explorer
[16:19:27] <ccmonster> bluefish is im looking to drink that night...while i code
[16:19:31] <aaronmcadam> what isn't austen
[16:19:36] <aaronmcadam> it might be in a ppa
[16:19:46] <aaronmcadam> but you're looking at just an untar
[16:19:48] <ccmonster> just go grab it off their site
[16:19:51] <ccmonster> its a self contained install
[16:19:53] <aaronmcadam> and run it off the binary
[16:19:53] <austen> aaronmcadam: 2 gigs
[16:19:58] <aaronmcadam> proc?
[16:20:07] <aaronmcadam> might struggle a wee bit
[16:20:33] <austen> Aptana isn't in Ubuntu's apt for 11.4... ALthough I should check my repositories...
[16:20:36] <ccmonster> I'd go geany or Gedit
[16:20:41] <aaronmcadam> if u turn off all the background processes and extra stuff like vcs integration it might be ok
[16:20:45] <ccmonster> then again, a darkhorse editer that is SOLId is KomodoEdit
[16:20:50] <aaronmcadam> it won't be there austen
[16:20:54] * maqr mumbles something abotu vim
[16:20:58] <ccmonster> just hit aptana.com
[16:21:06] <aaronmcadam> it's always been just self contained
[16:21:12] <ccmonster> vim is fine, but emacs and all that..whole diff ball game lol
[16:21:12] <aaronmcadam> unzip, no install, just run it
[16:21:23] <ccmonster> I say you just nano the shit. :)
[16:21:27] <aaronmcadam> yah
[16:21:30] <aaronmcadam> ctrl_o

[16:22:07] <ccmonster> hah  yea
[16:22:08] <aaronmcadam> you fuckin need that
[16:22:12] <ccmonster> yea you do
[16:22:19] <ccmonster> ctrl_c to get the line/column
[16:22:21] <aaronmcadam> makese replication servers easy to manage big time
[16:22:29] <ccmonster> when your compiler shits on you and tells you a guessed line/column
[16:22:30] <ccmonster> lol
[16:22:43] <aaronmcadam> wait a min, u actually code in there? lol
[16:22:46] <ccmonster> ctrl_c x 1 billion as you cursor along finding it
[16:23:20] <aaronmcadam> hmm where's the #super-cool-tools-you-need-for-jqueries channel
[16:23:41] <ccmonster> in nano you can set up a few custom highlighting pieces and BOOM!
[16:23:43] <ccmonster> good to go
[16:23:54] <ccmonster> .nanorc and boom goes the dynamite
[16:23:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> what's the equiv to array_merge()
[16:24:06] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster: are u telling me really, u do actual work in nano?
[16:24:16] <aaronmcadam> array_join :P
[16:24:21] <aaronmcadam> oj
[16:24:26] <ccmonster> haah
[16:24:37] <aaronmcadam> one more reason to hate php :D
[16:24:39] <ccmonster> I do work in nano quite often dude. It's like..my way of punishing myself
[16:24:44] <austen> A good text editor beats the shit out of a GUI.
[16:24:53] <aaronmcadam> $.merge ProLoser|Mobile
[16:24:57] * ccmonster pours out a little liquor for PHP, everyones favorite test tube baby
[16:25:06] <aaronmcadam> ?g is this workinggggg
[16:25:14] <austen> Emacs is awesome. But I'm stupid and I like buttons and tabs...
[16:25:17] * aaronmcadam kicks bot server up the hole
[16:25:18] <ProLoser|Mobile> danke
[16:25:20] <ccmonster> array_merge, array_join awesome!
[16:25:24] <ccmonster> bitte
[16:25:33] <ccmonster> ksort()
[16:25:33] <ccmonster> lol
[16:25:35] <aaronmcadam> aaah
[16:25:37] <aaronmcadam> fuck offff
[16:25:40] <ccmonster> oh my. i actually remember this shit lol
[16:25:51] <aaronmcadam> I've had SO MUCH FUN with array manip on php
[16:25:58] <ccmonster> ahaha
[16:25:59] <aaronmcadam> every method is bullshit
[16:26:00] <ccmonster> regexp
[16:26:06] <ccmonster> preg_match()
[16:26:11] <ccmonster> my FAVE
[16:26:17] <aaronmcadam> php.toDecentLanguage() :)
[16:26:29] <aaronw-1> haystack, needle!!!!!!
[16:26:36] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[16:26:45] <aaronmcadam> the amount of times in my old office we shouted that at each other
[16:26:52] <ccmonster> (Boolean)php.pray.CastType(ARealLanguage)
[16:26:56] <ccmonster> FALSE
[16:26:58] <ccmonster> wont happen
[16:26:58] <aaronmcadam> between php's str_replace and XSLT's replace :S
[16:27:10] <ccmonster> xlst is good shit tho lol
[16:27:12] <ccmonster> honest to god.
[16:27:15] <aaronmcadam> it's ok
[16:27:17] <ccmonster> xlst is the LOST art
[16:27:19] <aaronmcadam> once you understand it
[16:27:29] <aaronmcadam> but it's so bloody verbose to do simple things
[16:27:33] <ccmonster> true.
[16:27:36] <ccmonster> but its straight forward.
[16:27:38] <aaronmcadam> nested templates I know but ffs
[16:27:46] <ccmonster> oh well. life goes on
[16:27:56] <aaronmcadam> I don't want to have to set fucking keys to categories
[16:28:03] <ccmonster> that's why we just consume the shit in jquery and spit it out how we likey
[16:28:18] <aaronmcadam> not when your cms is based on xslt
[16:28:24] <ccmonster> then ...well..
[16:28:30] * ccmonster drinks
[16:28:34] * ccmonster drinks more
[16:28:39] * ccmonster looks for a cliff
[16:28:52] <aaronmcadam> it's ok but not designed for modern websites really
[16:28:58] <ccmonster> No.
[16:29:05] <aaronmcadam> for well i mean the patterns we use
[16:29:09] <ccmonster> with the great xmlslurper libs out there, its not as needed
[16:29:35] <aaronmcadam> i find YQL's XML to JSON feature cuts that out nicely :P
[16:29:54] <ccmonster> welly, i havent used any yql, but YAML and JSON are amazing
[16:30:01] <aaronmcadam> there are some really great parsers out there tho
[16:30:22] <aaronmcadam> yql is just a service, not really a data interchange format
[16:30:24] <ccmonster> domnode parsers from php perhaps?
[16:30:29] <ccmonster> ah|, yahoo query language
[16:30:30] <aaronmcadam> it's just a restful web service
[16:30:31] <ccmonster> lol
[16:30:47] <aaronmcadam> yep
[16:30:51] <ccmonster> forget that....how about....tsv's
[16:30:52] <ccmonster> all day
[16:30:56] <ccmonster> in json format
[16:31:00] <aaronmcadam> fuck php stop talkin bout that :D
[16:31:01] <ccmonster> i saw that once. Swear to god!
[16:31:01] <aaronmcadam> lol
[16:31:04] <aaronmcadam> i'm talkin python
[16:31:12] <ccmonster> i wanted to cry man
[16:31:14] <aaronmcadam> or ruby's hpricot or somethin
[16:31:29] <ccmonster> this dude had a key, and the value what a string rep of a .tsv line
[16:31:30] <aaronmcadam> tab separated?
[16:31:36] <ccmonster> i was like...WTF
[16:32:00] <ccmonster> all his shit was encoded and everything. I wanted to kill myself. but him first. Hari Kari style.
[16:32:22] <aaronmcadam> Furi Kuri?
[16:32:25] <ccmonster> ahah
[16:32:27] <aaronmcadam> :D
[16:32:32] <aaronmcadam> Fooly Cooly?!
[16:32:41] <aaronmcadam> FLCL!!!!!?
[16:32:46] <ccmonster> it was a dude
[16:32:48] <ccmonster> lol
[16:32:52] <aaronmcadam> what
[16:32:58] <aaronmcadam> I'm talking about FLCL LD
[16:33:10] <aaronmcadam> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLCL
[16:33:29] <aaronmcadam> excellent show :D
[16:33:35] <ccmonster> yea anime right?
[16:33:42] <ccmonster> and its just a term for like sex and groping i thought
[16:33:56] <aaronmcadam> basically they made it up
[16:33:57] <aaronmcadam> lol
[16:34:03] <aaronmcadam> in one episode it means curry :D
[16:34:10] <ccmonster> yea, but that's what it was interpreted as?
[16:34:13] <aaronmcadam> yep
[16:34:15] <ccmonster> ok
[16:34:17] <ccmonster> thougth os
[16:34:18] <aaronmcadam> it's mental
[16:34:38] <aaronmcadam> have u seen it?
[16:35:36] <ccmonster> i have seen some stuff. chicks floating around on guitars and shit.
[16:35:39] <ccmonster> but not really
[16:35:59] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:36:13] <Detroiter> *WOOOOO**, Michiganders in da house!
[16:36:29] <aaronmcadam> what are u on ccmonster, ubuntu?
[16:36:31] * Detroiter breaks it down for the Motor City.
[16:36:35] <ccmonster> right now..windoze
[16:36:39] <aaronmcadam> christ
[16:36:42] <ccmonster> because of all the office shit I am forced to do
[16:36:47] <ccmonster> and this machine is piss
[16:36:53] <aaronmcadam> ye need a new job brooo
[16:36:54] <Detroiter> ccmonster: Windows 7 or bust!
[16:36:55] <ccmonster> I need to steal a marketers macbook and hook it up
[16:37:04] <ccmonster> But to be honest, W7 Aint bad.
[16:37:12] <aaronmcadam> it's ok for porn
[16:37:13] <aaronmcadam> :P
[16:37:14] <aaronmcadam> lol
[16:37:15] <ccmonster> its the lack of a native shell and shit that drives me up a wall
[16:37:21] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:37:26] <aaronmcadam> "ls is not a function"
[16:37:29] <aaronmcadam> or some shite
[16:37:31] <ccmonster> haha yea
[16:37:31] <Detroiter> Detroit > *
[16:37:37] <aaronmcadam> tho there is a custom ext that supports it
[16:37:41] <ccmonster> they need to take that powershell shit and blow it out
[16:37:56] <ccmonster> however in aptana you can get full shell functionality so It's all good
[16:38:04] <ccmonster> so that itch is scratched when I have that open
[16:38:05] <aaronmcadam> thankfully i only use windows for games and dvds now
[16:38:15] <imsky> you're bitching over not having bash?
[16:38:16] <ccmonster> you can get dvds on linux. fugg that
[16:38:19] <imsky> you can download it easily
[16:38:24] <ccmonster> oh i know
[16:38:28] <aaronmcadam> yeah git-bash installs using cygwin
[16:38:31] <ccmonster> yeap
[16:38:36] <imsky> no need for cygwin either
[16:38:48] <imsky> msys offers native bash as well
[16:38:54] <Detroiter> **** GROOBE-JQUERY ***
[16:38:59] <Detroiter> bb
[16:39:09] <ccmonster> but in general i miss the nix world for the last few montsh
[16:39:20] <imsky> that's interesting
[16:39:22] <aaronmcadam> it's just so much better for dev
[16:39:34] <ccmonster> whats interesting.
[16:39:41] <Detroiter> Aptana is evil.
[16:39:44] <aaronmcadam> cli tools work the way you expect
[16:39:45] <ccmonster> ahah.
[16:39:46] <imsky> that you miss it, even though most of its functionality can be imported into windows
[16:40:08] <aaronmcadam> you can easily write little shell scripts here n there, awesomes
[16:40:27] <ccmonster> its so much more than that imsky , just one thing of note.
[16:40:29] <aaronmcadam> i think windows is still anti developer
[16:40:37] <imsky> ccmonster: well tell me about it, i dual boot both os's
[16:40:42] <imsky> want to hear another's perspective
[16:40:48] <imsky> what's so much more?
[16:40:58] <aaronmcadam> overall stability for me
[16:40:59] <ccmonster> and this machine blows arse and runs much better on a leaner nix instlal
[16:41:18] <imsky> that's not really
[16:41:20] <aaronmcadam> tho skype has some serious issues
[16:41:21] <imsky> quantitative lol
[16:41:29] <aaronmcadam> killall -9 is tiring
[16:41:34] <ccmonster> vms runs liek retarted molassses on this thing.
[16:41:38] <imsky> sounds more like "linux makes me feel 1337 lol screw M$"
[16:41:48] <aaronmcadam> uh
[16:41:55] <ccmonster> well i diddnt know i had a quantitative analysis report due by eod?
[16:41:56] <aaronmcadam> do people still type stuff like that
[16:42:09] <imsky> ccmonster: eh, "blows arse" is about as good a reason as none
[16:42:11] <austen> I think that Microsoft purposely fails at making IE standards compliant and "bug free" to force use of Microsofty "fixes" which inherently require you have a copy of Windows somewhere...
[16:42:26] <austen> Fucking IE... Always the axe in my ass...
[16:42:35] <imsky> you can get IE in Wine
[16:42:38] <imsky> no need for windows
[16:42:39] * Detroiter loves having Madonna pics as his desktop wallpaper.
[16:42:49] <aaronmcadam> platform support is the bain of every developer really
[16:42:55] <imsky> jesus christ lol
[16:42:56] <aaronmcadam> not just web
[16:43:07] <ccmonster> I am fine with Windows. before you entered perhaps, but i said W7 isn't bad at all
[16:43:09] <aaronmcadam> even if you're java
[16:43:10] <aaronmcadam> lol
[16:43:13] <austen> Yes, however IE is the boil that refuses to burst. Always.
[16:43:19] <Detroiter> Fucking hot: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0dR-TAz-_Kk/TgYnRAeNf6I/AAAAAAAALvE/S3Rx-a1B5-c/s1600/mo7903.jpg
[16:43:21] <ccmonster> haha
[16:43:22] <ccmonster> haha
[16:43:35] <Detroiter> Madonna is hot
[16:43:42] <ccmonster> madonna is NOT hot.
[16:43:44] <aaronmcadam> the old bitch
[16:43:47] <austen> I've used IE under wine, tried to get it going but the browser repository was broken and I couldn't get a copy of it.
[16:44:00] <ccmonster> i could rest my foot in between her gap teeth
[16:44:10] <aaronmcadam> you every try installing wine on windows?
[16:44:12] <ccmonster> and she's just used up.
[16:44:19] <austen> That and who the fuck needs to test against IE 5, 5.5 and 6? AFAIK IE 7 is still "beta" under wine.
[16:44:36] <ccmonster> I just choose not to support anything older than IE8
[16:44:38] <ccmonster> lol
[16:44:40] <aaronmcadam> VMs are what ye need
[16:44:45] <ccmonster> however, it's not my choice lol
[16:44:50] <aaronmcadam> what?
[16:44:59] <aaronmcadam> how many users do u have ccmonster?
[16:45:12] <austen> Yes. VM's are the way to go.
[16:45:13] <ccmonster> um, ....good god. i dont even know.
[16:45:24] <aaronmcadam> thousands, millions?
[16:45:28] <ccmonster> millions
[16:45:38] <aaronmcadam> and you're only supporting ie8?
[16:45:45] <aaronmcadam> that's mental
[16:45:45] <ccmonster> it was a joke. lol
[16:45:49] <aaronmcadam> hah
[16:45:50] <ccmonster> "however, it's not my choice lol"
[16:45:58] <snover> much like google.
[16:46:07] <austen> Even IE8 as the LCD is still a royal pain in the ass. Opera: WORKS! Safari: WORKS!! FF: WORKS!! Chrome: WORKS!!!! IE... Oh fuck...
[16:46:17] <ccmonster> I commend google for doing that. they are big enough, and name brand enough to get people to upgrade
[16:46:32] <Detroiter> ccmonster: I want to rest my z*peni* in her gap
[16:46:36] <pandeiro> anyone else notice problems using jquery selectors with tables? is this a known issue?
[16:46:52] <ccmonster> havent noticed pandeiro , what ver of jquery yo uon ?
[16:46:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah but google aren't "enterprisy enough"
[16:46:53] <aaronmcadam> hhehe
[16:46:57] <ccmonster> ha.
[16:46:57] <pandeiro> ie $('table tr td') returns nothing even when the table has rows and cells
[16:46:59] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:47:00] <pandeiro> 1.6.2
[16:47:09] <ccmonster> uhh.
[16:47:09] <aaronmcadam> that's balls
[16:47:11] <ccmonster> shenanigans
[16:47:16] <Detroiter> ccmonster: Who wouldn't totally want to sexify this: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0dR-TAz-_Kk/TgYnRAeNf6I/AAAAAAAALvE/S3Rx-a1B5-c/s1600/mo7903.jpg
[16:47:17] <aaronmcadam> i call bullshit
[16:47:17] <aaronmcadam> :D
[16:47:27] <aaronmcadam> bullshit on you mister
[16:47:29] <ccmonster> got a fiddle, page, or pastie?
[16:47:33] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle please
[16:47:37] <pandeiro> me?
[16:47:41] <austen> You're still using tables?
[16:47:45] <aaronmcadam> and *please* don't paste ALL your html
[16:47:47] <Detroiter> austen: Yes.
[16:47:52] <pandeiro> http://jsfiddle.net/9DPHN/3/
[16:47:58] <ccmonster> tables are fine....
[16:48:01] <ccmonster> for tabular data
[16:48:02] <pandeiro> yes me and google and every other production website still uses them
[16:48:17] <pandeiro> until flexbox and other css3 is everywhere it's the best solution for vertical alignment
[16:48:21] <aaronmcadam> i'm almost afraid to look
[16:48:26] <Detroiter> pandeiro: You go girl (or guy)!
[16:48:38] <Detroiter> I use tables too, when it makes sense. :p
[16:48:39] <ccmonster> wow@ flexbox. hmm
[16:48:45] <aaronmcadam> uh
[16:49:10] <aaronmcadam> wtf are u doing?
[16:49:12] <ccmonster> uhh
[16:49:15] <ccmonster> there is no tr and td
[16:49:28] <pandeiro> ccmonster: uhh, it's added programatically
[16:49:34] <aaronmcadam> be careful about using forEach btw
[16:49:40] <pandeiro> aaronmcadam: cant teach you to read right now son thanks anyway
[16:49:46] <aaronmcadam> oi
[16:49:53] <aaronmcadam> watch yourself
[16:49:59] <pandeiro> aaronmcadam: i have been writing javascript probably longer than you have been using the web
[16:50:04] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[16:50:09] <pandeiro> yes wtf indeed
[16:50:18] <aaronmcadam> haha little bollocks
[16:50:19] <pandeiro> be pedantic with someone else
[16:50:20] <imsky> oh wow #jquery is noob central tonight
[16:50:27] <ccmonster> dude, relax.
[16:50:28] <aaronmcadam> that was NOT pedantic
[16:50:32] * Detroiter is downloading http://www.madonnatribe.com/i_press_26/rs_italia_2010_001.jpg
[16:50:34] * imsky grabs some popcorn
[16:50:41] <dabear> imsky: #jquery is always noob central
[16:50:41] <snover> CHILLAX YOU BUTTS
[16:50:55] <ccmonster> haah imsky
[16:50:56] <imsky> dabear: not always
[16:50:56] <Detroiter> imsky: But we love our newbs. =)
[16:51:03] * imsky grumble grumble
[16:51:08] <dabear> always
[16:51:18] <ccmonster> haha
[16:51:18] <imsky> well i hope you're wrong
[16:51:22] <imsky> because #web is a ghost town now
[16:51:22] <ccmonster> he's not
[16:51:25] <imsky> because of aforementioned newbs
[16:51:27] <ccmonster> sadly.
[16:51:38] <pandeiro> so why is $('table td') returning an empty array there? anyone have any ideas?
[16:51:41] <aaronmcadam> here ye go u asshole
[16:51:41] <aaronmcadam> forEach is a recent addition to the ECMA-262 standard; as such it may not be present in other implementations of the standard.
[16:51:47] <imsky> haha
[16:51:48] <pandeiro> i didnt come here for idle geek chat
[16:51:59] <pandeiro> aaronmcadam: you assume i didnt know that? wtf
[16:52:04] <aaronmcadam> there's a reason why underscore implements it
[16:52:12] <aaronmcadam> that's all i was saying
[16:52:17] <plov> is there a way to say form.serialize()['data_name'] and get the value of it?
[16:52:19] <aaronmcadam> what's with your attitude jesus
[16:52:21] <snover> aaronmcadam: be nice.
[16:52:28] <pandeiro> aaronmcadam: i am testing something in jsfiddle and my production code implements forEach if it isnt present, thank you for the diversion though
[16:52:34] <aaronmcadam> he's the one being an absolute dick
[16:52:42] <aaronmcadam> but nvm :)
[16:52:46] <pandeiro> no you are being a moron and distracting from the point
[16:52:46] <imsky> dude you're a grown man
[16:52:50] <snover> sigh.
[16:52:58] * imsky facepalm.jpg
[16:53:01] * Detroiter got to meet Madonna's web team today! :D
[16:53:05] <ccmonster> if you dont want to help, just ignore him.
[16:53:11] <ccmonster> and vice versa
[16:53:19] <aaronmcadam> i was trying...
[16:53:25] <pandeiro> i am wondering if there are issues where the browser adds a tbody element automatically, if that messes with jquery for some reason
[16:53:30] <Detroiter> They are so totally XHTML divas
[16:53:30] <pandeiro> that is the only thing i can think of
[16:53:36] <imsky> pandeiro: it shouldn't
[16:53:50] <Detroiter> What's wrong with being a newb?
[16:53:57] <ccmonster> nothing Detroiter
[16:54:08] <ccmonster> its a phase :)
[16:54:55] <snover> pandeiro: Some browsers that add implicit tbody will break direct descendant queries if you are trying to look for table > td
[16:55:09] <pandeiro> snover: you fucking rock THANK YOU
[16:55:17] <pandeiro> now is there a fix?
[16:55:22] <pandeiro> or a workaround?
[16:55:24] <snover> "table td" is not a direct descendant query.
[16:55:39] <pandeiro> yeah but 'table tbody tr td' didnt work
[16:55:44] <pandeiro> nor did 'table tr td'
[16:55:59] <snover> the latter should work fine always.
[16:56:08] <pandeiro> 'table tr td'?
[16:56:09] <ryanneufeld> pandeiro: $('table').find('td')
[16:56:12] <snover> yes
[16:56:15] <snover> though the tr is entirely redundant
[16:56:40] <ccmonster> yea.
[16:56:41] <ryanneufeld> snover: $('table').find('td') would work as well
[16:56:59] <aaronmcadam> slightly faster
[16:57:00] <ccmonster> couldnt you implement autocomplete here?
[16:57:02] <snover> ryanneufeld: less efficient.
[16:57:11] <aaronmcadam> ah it's ids then?
[16:57:13] <_zoggy_> table > td
[16:57:21] <ryanneufeld> really?
[16:57:21] <_zoggy_> just give td a class.
[16:57:27] <_zoggy_> td.whatever
[16:57:38] <imsky> lol
[16:57:55] <aaronmcadam> is it elemetns and then classes that are slower
[16:58:04] <ryanneufeld> I thought that "table td" would end up triggering sizzle which would do a find
[16:58:08] <_zoggy_> fastest is id's, then classes
[16:58:15] <ccmonster> ids are fastest, i know that
[16:58:20] <aaronmcadam> elements should be in the middle
[16:58:26] <aaronmcadam> you'd think
[16:58:27] <austen> Well, it's been a gas, srsly. :) But time to shove food in my mouth.
[16:58:36] <ccmonster> adios austen
[16:58:53] <austen> ciao bello e bella
[16:58:58] <aaronmcadam> is table a special case then? maybe?
[16:59:07] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: i thought the same as you man
[16:59:19] <pandeiro> ryanneufeld: snover: neither approach works
[16:59:24] <pandeiro> http://jsfiddle.net/9DPHN/7/
[16:59:35] <_zoggy_> depends on what your doing and how your content is made
[16:59:39] <snover> pandeiro: you need to have shit in your table for it to work
[16:59:45] <_zoggy_> and how good your selector is
[16:59:51] <pandeiro> snover - type a y in the input and press down
[16:59:56] <pandeiro> there is clearly 'shit in my table'
[17:00:08] <ryanneufeld> snover: http://jsperf.com/selector-vs-find/2 that looks like find is faster to me
[17:00:28] <snover> ryanneufeld: for an id selector, yes
[17:00:51] <snover> Selecting just an ID shortcuts to getElementById
[17:01:07] <Danny_Joris> so I can't make functions within a JS loop? I want to loop a number of elements and I want to use setTimeout on them. But I can't put a function in the timeout. How do I achieve triggering a function on multiple elements with a delay in between ?
[17:01:22] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: have you seen this? quite good: http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-proven-performance-tips-tricks-slides/
[17:01:22] <_zoggy_> go watch: http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-performance-tips-2011/
[17:01:24] <ryanneufeld> http://jsperf.com/selector-vs-find-again/2
[17:01:30] <ryanneufeld> using a class this time
[17:01:40] <Detroiter> At madonna.com, they have a lot of team building exercies. Like a competition to see who can add the most validation errors to the site without it breaking.
[17:01:42] <Detroiter> Then they circlejerk while running w3c's validator
[17:01:45] * Detroiter hates the World Wide Web consortium.
[17:01:53] <_zoggy_> talks about which is the best way to access the dom/find elements
[17:01:55] <aaronmcadam> whatabout whatwg? :P
[17:01:56] <Danny_Joris> I get this JSLint error: Problem at line 147 character 116: Don't make functions within a loop.
[17:02:01] <_zoggy_> direct link to video: http://vimeo.com/18846584
[17:02:12] <snover> pandeiro: you call emptyResults immediately before then bro
[17:02:22] <aaronmcadam> Danny_Joris: yeah, define it above
[17:02:25] <Detroiter> HTML validation errors are a badge of honour in America. =)
[17:02:48] <pandeiro> snover: I call emptyResults and then findMatches which populates the table
[17:03:09] <pandeiro> when I log $('table.results') to the console it shows the whole tree
[17:03:31] <pandeiro> when I log $('table.results td'), nada... $('table.results').find('td'), nada...
[17:03:35] <snover> pandeiro: in webkit (chrome, safari), console.log is asynchronous and does not show you exactly what you looked for at the moment you looked for it
[17:03:50] <pandeiro> snover: so you think it's a race condition?
[17:04:09] <snover> it’s not a race condition. you call emptyResult, and then you try to find shit, and then you populate it
[17:04:21] <snover> it’s a “you are executing things in the wrong order” issue
[17:04:52] <pandeiro> snover, did you type a 'y' in the input?
[17:05:08] <ryanneufeld> http://jsperf.com/selector-vs-find-table
[17:05:13] <ryanneufeld> about the same
[17:05:13] <dyjytyl> http://pastie.org/2342166 <- problem with getting json
[17:05:20] <dyjytyl> can anyone help with me that?
[17:06:11] <snover> pandeiro: I really can not help you any more than I just did since you seem to be under the impression that when you call emptyResults, and then jQuery, and then findMatches, IN THAT ORDER, that findMatches is going to magically insert itself between the call to emptyResult and the call to jQuery
[17:06:13] <snover> which it doesn’t
[17:06:15] <snover> because javascript is not magic
[17:07:00] <etcetera> ok so this is tedious, Im' going to back to facebox.
[17:07:57] <etcetera> jquery ui dialog is not jiving with this theme.
[17:07:58] <pandeiro> snover: I see what you are saying, the DOM gets erased and replaced without any visual cue but jquery to searching in that instant in between
[17:08:51] <dyjytyl> never mind, i fixed it. had to use $.ajax and dataType: 'jsonp'
[17:09:14] <aaronmcadam> maqr: did u fix that coffeescript thing?
[17:09:28] <pandeiro> it was just a question of placing findMatches before the switch statement
[17:09:50] <pandeiro> which would have been obvious if i hadnt been writing 99% async code for the last few months
[17:11:14] <pandeiro> snover: cheers, aaronmcadam: sorry to bitch at you, bug fury
[17:11:50] <aaronmcadam> pandeiro: no worries
[17:15:29] <Danny_Joris> aaronmcadam: I'm trying to set it outside the loop (at the bottom, I created an idle function)
[17:15:31] <Danny_Joris> http://jsfiddle.net/Danny_Joris/J9skd/84/
[17:16:31] <Danny_Joris> Basically what I'm trying is to have the items slide individually, instead of the block.
[17:16:48] <Danny_Joris> individually with a tiny delay in between
[17:17:06] <ajpiano> ?delay2 @ Danny_Joris
[17:17:11] <aaronmcadam> debounce?
[17:17:13] <ajpiano> damnit bot-t
[17:17:17] <aaronmcadam> yeah it's down
[17:17:20] <ajpiano> Danny_Joris: there's no queue there.
[17:17:39] <ajpiano> the same issue as there is for delay exists for your "idle" implementation
[17:17:41] <aaronmcadam> what's ben_alman's timeout plugin too tiredddd
[17:17:45] <Danny_Joris> ajpiano: yeah I wasn't sure what queue does. i took it from a knipet
[17:18:10] <ajpiano> queue for adding functions to the queue on the element, which is typically the effects queue
[17:18:23] <ajpiano> things that aren't effect or added explicitly through queue(fn) don't go into the queue
[17:18:27] <ajpiano> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[17:20:10] <ajpiano> Danny_Joris: the ideal way is to have the callback of the first thing trigger the second thing, and so on and so forth as described here http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[17:20:48] <aaronmcadam> adam, do you know off the top of your head if you can do model.extend instead of .set in backbone?
[17:21:03] <aaronmcadam> my set is overwriting my attrs i think
[17:21:12] <ajpiano> i don't think you'd want to....
[17:21:16] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[17:21:19] <Danny_Joris> ajpiano: cool, thanks for all the advice. looks good
[17:21:24] <aaronmcadam> I just want to add a couple of extra things
[17:21:34] <ajpiano> the point is to use .set so that you get all the proper event property triggering
[17:21:46] <aaronmcadam> yeah I'm not really using that functionality though
[17:21:52] <ajpiano> the *point* of set is to override your attrs :p
[17:21:59] <aaronmcadam> ah!
[17:22:25] <aaronmcadam> hmm so setting a custom attr overwrites the whole of attrs?
[17:22:35] <ajpiano> if you want to put arbitrary properties on the model that aren't meant to be proper "attributes" in a backbone sense, you can just tack them on, but obviously they won't persist.
[17:22:47] <ajpiano> no, it should just set the attr you're setting
[17:22:53] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[17:23:01] <ajpiano> Danny_Joris: ok
[17:23:01] <aaronmcadam> cheers man
[17:23:04] <ajpiano> good :)
[17:23:12] <ajpiano> i gotta run gentlemen, good luck
[17:23:18] <aaronmcadam> thanks a lot adam see ya
[17:23:38] <coldhead> lol adam
[17:23:48] <aaronmcadam> woooo
[17:24:03] <aaronmcadam> dammit i'm tired but I want to do more jqueries
[17:25:16] <levity_island> https://gist.github.com/1133131
[17:25:25] <levity_island> wtf is query doing auto-retrying callbacks
[17:25:30] <levity_island> *jquery
[17:25:51] <levity_island> run that gist and check out your console
[17:29:04] <jaysern> i have an element in the "this" keyword, but how do i run jquery operations on it ?
[17:29:49] <jaysern> ok, nvm .. figured out
[17:29:58] <jaysern> jQuery(this)
[17:31:44] <aaronmcadam> goddammit, I keep refactoring and then forgetting to update everything hhaha
[17:31:49] <aaronmcadam> tiredness sucks
[17:32:59] <austen> Going on 30 hours no sleep for me...
[17:33:06] <aaronmcadam> wow
[17:33:10] <aaronmcadam> when's your deadline?
[17:33:19] <aaronmcadam> don't say yesterday :(
[17:33:21] <austen> Lol... No deadline. :)
[17:33:37] <austen> I'm not even employed at the moment. :)
[17:34:03] <aaronmcadam> aw sorry to hear
[17:34:33] <austen> It'll be rectified soon enough. Plenty of software engineering jobs in Los Angeles.
[17:34:42] <aaronmcadam> ah i'm sure
[17:34:42] <coldhead> i'm not sorry, austen is freeeeeee
[17:34:57] <coldhead> enjoy it while you can
[17:35:07] <austen> Freeeee as a birrrrrd. And brooooke as a caaaat
[17:35:52] <austen> All I gotta say is: FUCK FREELANCING!
[17:35:56] <aaronmcadam> haha!
[17:35:58] <austen> I'm too old for that shit.
[17:36:08] <aaronmcadam> it's so lonelyyyy
[17:36:17] <aaronmcadam> and a bit thankless
[17:36:58] <aaronmcadam> quick q: just noticed a small issue with an input that fires a keyup
[17:37:01] <austen> That I never minded. It was the constant edumacation of my clients. "What do you MEAN my uber-feature-rich-website is going to cost more that $300?!
[17:37:13] <aaronmcadam> when i type a value i've entered before, it's obviously not firing the keyup
[17:37:15] <aaronmcadam> is there an event?
[17:37:36] <austen> And then they have a heart attack when I multiply that by 10 and say, "That is the number where we *begin*, then we add on your uber-features. :)"
[17:37:40] <aaronmcadam> there's nothing like "change" for an input right
[17:37:59] <aaronmcadam> haha managing expectations
[17:38:17] <beasty> evening
[17:38:18] <aaronmcadam> but if you're up front it's best i guess
[17:38:44] <aaronmcadam> better than underestimating and basically working for free
[17:39:02] <aaronmcadam> anyone have any ideas?
[17:39:19] <aaronmcadam> I could turn off autocomplete on the input right
[17:39:45] <austen> I had one client who, after I gave him my quote (a detailed 8 pages for a not-so complicated website), he went online and typed out one sentence request for bids: "I need a website with a home page and some images" and got a quote for $250.
[17:40:00] <aaronmcadam> haha
[17:40:13] <beasty> hmm that's was a dirty fix
[17:40:15] <aaronmcadam> yeah sounds like clients from hell
[17:40:23] <austen> He didn't mention he wanted to sell his enventory of used and new equipment, update his own content in a webby way, etc, etc.
[17:40:34] <beasty> rebinding a .click() after data insert
[17:40:35] <beasty> *brr*
[17:40:46] <aaronmcadam> is there even an event?
[17:41:10] <aaronmcadam> does the click of the selected option from the browser's autocomplete tie to the input?
[17:42:07] <aaronmcadam> it's not really a usability issue, it's an input for buying more entries into a competition
[17:42:14] <austen> Some of my clients were awesome, though... But waaay too much work and not nearly enough pay. I can make 3 times in salary what I earned gross revenue with my web development/hosting firm... And only 40 hours a week (excluding deadlines)
[17:42:47] <aaronmcadam> yeah, think we all end up going over the 40 hrs
[17:43:03] <aaronmcadam> i know the devs i work with all do loads
[17:43:07] <aaronmcadam> and no overtime pay
[17:43:23] <aaronmcadam> "time off in lieu" but then nobody is able to take time off lol
[17:43:28] <aaronmcadam> sometimes an early friday
[17:43:57] <austen> Pay is good enough to justify that, though...
[17:44:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah i hear ya
[17:44:26] <aaronmcadam> so does anyone know of anything I can do?
[17:44:35] <aaronmcadam> or in general is it possible?
[17:44:54] <austen> MMnnnDamn. That was some tasty chicken!
[17:45:02] <aaronmcadam> i think in this instance it doesn't make sense to have it autocomplete anyways
[17:46:01] <austen> There is change on input, yes
[17:47:16] <danielt> hello i'm wondering if theres any jquery.animate pro's around that could help a brother out?
[17:47:42] <aaronmcadam> oh there is?
[17:47:53] <aaronmcadam> I've just turned it off there ehhe
[17:48:16] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't make sense in this use case anyway
[17:48:41] <aaronmcadam> especially on mobile
[17:48:50] <gnarf> ?ask @danielt
[17:48:50] <aaronmcadam> (qm project)
[17:48:56] <aaronmcadam> (jqm project)
[17:49:00] * gnarf cries for bot-t
[17:49:11] <danielt> http://pastie.org/2342336 line 68 the callback just doesn't work
[17:49:12] <aaronmcadam> it's been down a lot this past while
[17:49:27] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[17:49:28] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 8 hours, 56 minutes and 19 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 255 seconds
[17:49:28] <danielt> even though i copied off the example
[17:49:38] <djQuery> he's taken the whole day odd
[17:49:41] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[17:49:47] <aaronmcadam> he's off seeing his lady
[17:49:55] <gnarf> danielt: does the animation work?
[17:49:57] <aaronmcadam> or maybe in some other irc channel!
[17:50:05] <aaronmcadam> helping out mootools folk :D
[17:50:23] <aaronmcadam> oh i mean dojo, that's the cool jq alternative right :D
[17:50:34] <gnarf> if #productContainer1 doesn't exist it won't get called
[17:50:42] <danielt> the animation works it's supposed to increment by $x then poll the database for the next move
[17:50:56] <danielt> instead it just animates the first time round then stops
[17:51:08] <aaronmcadam> right that's me for tonight, bloody 1:50am dammit!
[17:51:14] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net
[17:51:20] <aaronmcadam> cheers austen see ya, hope ya get sorted with work soon man
[17:51:31] <gnarf> danielt: can you get a working (or rather - not working) reproduction?
[17:51:38] <jkoudys> is there a tree traversal function similar to nextAll(), except that it returns all the next siblings and the original selector in the result set?
[17:52:01] <danielt> problem is that the data is coming from a microcontroller
[17:52:03] <aaronmcadam> you can use .andSelf to add the orig node
[17:52:13] <gnarf> danielt: ever hear of fake data?
[17:52:28] <danielt> yeah i'll do that now
[17:52:37] <jkoudys> aaronmcadam: thanks that's it
[17:52:40] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/andSelf
[17:52:41] <gnarf> :)
[17:52:51] <aaronmcadam> good JKarsrud
[17:53:00] <aaronmcadam> jkoudys i meant haha
[17:53:00] <jjb123> What's the best truncate text to n number of lines (multi line truncate) that takes the size of the text's container into account? I tried this plugin: https://gist.github.com/907237 but it doesn't work in IE =/
[17:53:03] <aaronmcadam> see ya guys
[17:53:39] <jjb123> I would this this is a common problem people face but it seems like there are no plugins to do it.
[17:53:48] <jjb123> think*
[17:53:58] <gnarf> jjb123: considering im not even sure what you're asking, i doubt its a "common problem"
[17:54:54] <gnarf> are you trying to limit the text in the element so it doesn't overflow the box?
[17:55:01] <jkoudys> hmm andSelf always adds the original to the end - can I make it prepend it instead?
[17:55:09] <jkoudys> not seeing a way to do that in the doc
[17:55:20] <gnarf> jkoudys: i'm pretty sure it uses DOM ordering
[17:55:49] <danielt> damn that will take hours of rework
[17:56:09] <jjb123> gnarf: Say I have a container that is 200px wide and contains a string. I want that string to be able to wrap to 2 lines and if it exceeds that the end should be replaced with an ellipsis or something.
[17:56:18] <austen> aaronmcadam: Thanks buddy, it'll happen sooner than later >)
[17:56:31] <austen> Aah blast... Missed him..
[17:57:33] <jjb123> gnarf: There are dozens of jquery truncate plugins, but they all (that I've seen) only allow 1 line of text. I can't do it sever side because the server doesn't know the size of the container.
[17:58:03] <austen> Nothing works in IE. You have to develop your app and then scale back a dumbed-down version for IE. At least that's always been my experience!
[17:58:44] <jjb123> yeah I think I might just have to abandon this whole thing in IE and just add overflow: hidden to everything
[17:59:11] <jkoudys> gnarf: What I'm really trying to do is move all <li> including the original at once, so the ordering must be maintained. If I have <ul><li class='a'/><li class='b'/><li class='c'/>, and I do $(".b").nextAll().andSelf(), the result is actuallc, b not b,c (which is what I want)
[17:59:14] <gnarf> i would just overflow: hidden the container...
[17:59:45] <gnarf> anything more is more work / crazy behavior for some fn periods :)
[18:00:17] <jjb123> gnarf: Yeah, that's what I was thinking but I was just hoping there was a btter way lol
[18:01:36] <gnarf> jjb123: you kidding? thats like 2 seconds of work... make sure the height is a multiple of lineheight and then set overflow: hidden
[18:01:37] <gnarf> done
[18:01:59] <gnarf> anything else involves cloning text nodes, calculating heights, probably binary searching a string for the correct point to insert ...
[18:02:02] <gnarf> etc
[18:04:19] <jjb123> gnarf: I meant better in that I can do quotes and not have it look retard (e.g. "This is how it should..." vs. "This is how it sho)
[18:05:09] <gnarf> jjb123: why don't you just guess at a nice "1.5 line" number and handle it server side
[18:05:14] <gnarf> and if you end up with 3 lines, ofw
[18:05:52] <gnarf> that would be about 1/3rd the headache of trying to do it client side :)
[18:05:56] <jjb123> Hum, I really like that idea. I think I'll do that. Thanks for your input!
[18:05:57] <jjb123> haha yeah
[18:06:06] <gnarf> although - Guessing in general is the key there
[18:06:10] <jjb123> true
[18:06:15] <gnarf> if you get like ~50 chars a line, use like 80
[18:06:24] <gnarf> and it should be okay 90% of the time
[18:06:37] <jjb123> yeah
[18:06:50] <gnarf> good ole 90/10 optimization rule
[18:07:11] <danielt> well look at that solved it all on my own!
[18:07:46] <gnarf> danielt: and?
[18:09:25] <danielt> it was a variable not being passed correctly to the animate function
[18:10:04] <danielt> jquery on industrial plc's has been an interesting experience so far
[18:10:17] <Danny_Joris> ajpiano: not sure if you're still around, but I found the solution by looking into the nivo slider code.
[18:10:57] <Danny_Joris> ajpiano: I didn't really want sequential effects, but one's that follow each other up really fast.
[18:12:08] <Danny_Joris> ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/zsKLH5Fv where addTimeBuff is set to 100 for example...
[18:13:21] <ajpiano> yeah that's reasonable if that's what you want i guess :)
[18:15:55] <Danny_Joris> ajpiano: I tried a ton of functions that looked like that, but I guess I never really got it before. It kind of got me drifting into other crazy attempts
[18:16:27] <Danny_Joris> it's the timeBuff += 100 that was really important
[18:16:42] <Danny_Joris> .each() isn't sequential i guess
[18:16:50] <Danny_Joris> i didn't know that
[18:17:21] <ajpiano> ah... yeah... that's kind of an important thing to know
[18:17:57] <Danny_Joris> that's the main reason why I custom built this slider: http://jsfiddle.net/Danny_Joris/J9skd/85/
[18:18:12] <Danny_Joris> I'll have to change the effect to sliding now
[18:21:02] <plov> how can i get a form's data as an associative array with jquery?
[18:21:23] <donCams> hi var myNamespace = { init : function() { var defaults = {}; }}, is var defaults local variable?
[18:21:34] <donCams> i know it's more of a javascript question :)
[18:23:15] <levity_island> donCams: yes.
[18:23:55] <gnarf> plov: very carefully?
[18:24:11] <plov> huh?
[18:24:16] <gnarf> plov: you do know there is not such thing as an "associative array" in JavaScript right?
[18:24:38] <gnarf> perhaps you meant to ask for it as an object?
[18:25:13] <plov> sure, how would that be done?
[18:26:18] <gnarf> well, there is a function called serializeArray
[18:26:29] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray
[18:26:51] <gnarf> if you want to convert that array to an actual object
[18:27:44] <gnarf> you can do something like var obj = {}; $.each( form.seralizeArray(), function( index, data ) { obj[ data.name ] = data.value; } );
[18:28:14] <gnarf> but you'll probably have issues with that if you're using an input with [] as only the last value will get stored, not all of them
[18:28:35] <gnarf> the format of serializeArray is probably easiest to work with
[18:29:34] <gnarf> the array format [{ name: "a", value: "a" }, ...] format also works with jQuery.param() http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param
[18:30:34] <donCams> levity_island, thanks
[18:33:39] <austen> The difference between Chrome and IE8 on my laptop is *staggering*
[18:34:03] <austen> Those peeps at Google sure did an amazing job!
[18:35:43] <coldhead> yeah but chrome is infected with communism
[18:35:55] <coldhead> ie is ALL AMERICAN PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE
[18:36:05] <austen> lol!
[18:42:23] <levity_island> https://gist.github.com/1133131 <-- pls check this out and tell me if jquery keeps trying to run the callback, filling the console log with errors.
[18:43:04] <gnarf> levity_island: passing null is not a valid argument to slideDown
[18:43:13] <gnarf> just pass the function if you want to use the default time
[18:43:26] <levity_island> oh, interesting.
[18:43:54] <levity_island> that's one heck of a funny side effect for incorrect params
[18:48:53] <crankharder> anyone familiar with jqueryFormPlugin -- in the beforeSubmit, I hide the submit button and show a spinner.  In teh success callback, I hide the spinner and show the button again.  Problem is, the server is responding so quickly that $('.submit img').length is zero inside the success callback.  Odd, no?  If I execute the same query in the console, it finds the img tag just fine... any ideas how to fix this?
[18:53:26] <tyoc213> is jquery MVC?
[18:53:42] <levity_island> tyoc213: no
[18:54:19] <levity_island> that's not what it's for
[18:55:15] <levity_island> jquery is just a clean API for manipulating the DOM and making ajax requests and other client-side JS stuff
[18:55:39] <levity_island> it doesn't recommend any particular way of separating your views and data
[19:02:05] <tyoc213> OK, any good NVC libs that I can use with jquery?
[19:02:12] <airportyh> c
[19:02:52] <tyoc213> so frameworks like jquery or prototype can be used with other MVC frameworks?
[19:03:33] <coldhead> sure you can
[19:03:42] <coldhead> jQUery is very social
[19:20:16] <tyoc213> thx, because Im evaluating the usage, but because there is no exact "control" about how you write js, I was hoping that introducing a MVC framework could bring some "order"
[19:21:41] <ajpiano> tyoc213: checkout backbone.js, spine.js, sproutcore, knockoutjs
[19:22:26] <tyoc213> OK, I will do it :)
[19:22:28] <tyoc213> thx people
[19:39:02] <Danny_Joris> I'm running a slideshow in which elements are animated to slide and change opacity. It seems like the blocks that slide out are slower in fading out than the blocks sliding in, fading in. The settings seem the same. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/Danny_Joris/J9skd/94/
[19:39:17] <Danny_Joris> it's set to be extra slow
[19:39:31] <Danny_Joris> it seems like the blocks sliding in should fade in slower... ?
[19:51:12] <jkoudys> is there a way to check if my selector is using the native querySelectorAll()?
[19:52:41] <webe> Does anyone know how to remove the ::selection on double click?
[19:55:32] <datarecall> any thoughts on how to use .unload to scroll to the top of the page ? animate inside unload does not work
[20:28:00] <atula> datarecall: what are you trying to do now?
[20:28:26] <datarecall> was trying to scroll to top on an .unload but it wont let me had to dow a window.location.href
[20:28:26] <atula> datarecall: you're asking how to do stuff when user nagivate away or close the window? (which is the unload event)
[20:29:03] <webe> Does anyone know how to remove the ::selection on double click?
[20:29:14] <atula> do describe what you want to do in more vivid details, datarecall. I am curious.
[20:30:07] <datarecall> on unload im changing the body around a bit and giving them a better offer but they need to be scrolled up to see it
[20:30:36] <atula> webe: not that I know of. but you're tredding on creating unexpected user experience... which isn't always the best thing in my opinion
[20:30:53] <atula> datarecall: before they close the window?
[20:30:55] <datarecall> tried everything but i was reading unload does async events and i couldnt figure out how to do it
[20:30:56] <datarecall> yes
[21:12:51] <webe> Does anyone know how to remove the ::selection on double click?
[21:28:20] <wangdoo> See this http://projects.alicialiu.net/jquery-tagify-demo/.There is a code      $('textarea.tagme').tagify('serialize');.I assigned this to a variable and bind keyup event but it is not working.I'm trying to remove this text area when i press enter key.
[21:28:59] <zivester> if I have 3 jquery objects I want to place inside another jquery object.. whats the fastest way to do this.. I know append.append.append isn't recommended, but I also dont have the raw html either
[21:37:21] <danheberden> zivester $().add( element1, element2, element3 )
[21:39:07] <danheberden> alternatively, if you are just creating a collection
[21:39:13] <zivester> weird, why isn't that undert jquery manipulation.. its under traversing... tx danheberden
[21:39:16] <danheberden> you can just do $( [element1, element2] )
[21:39:32] <danheberden> zivester cuz it also takes a selector 'n stuff see ?add
[21:39:49] <danheberden> oh, no bot-t
[21:39:55] <danheberden> http://api.jquery.com/add
[21:42:40] <wangdoo> danheberden:  See this http://projects.alicialiu.net/jquery-tagify-demo/.There is a code      $('textarea.tagme').tagify('serialize');.I assigned this to a variable and bind keyup event but it is not working.I'm trying to remove this text area when i press enter key.
[21:43:18] <zivester> hmm why doesn't $('div').add( [ e1, e2, e3 ] ) work ?
[21:43:36] <danheberden> zivester add doesn't take an array of elements, id on't htink
[21:43:44] <danheberden> it'd be add( e1, e2, e3)
[21:44:42] <danheberden> var $div = $('div'); $div.add.apply( $div, [e1,e2,e3] )
[21:44:48] <danheberden> but the last is a bit messy
[21:44:49] <zivester> i want e1,e2,e3 to be children of div
[21:44:56] <danheberden> oy
[21:44:58] <danheberden> then append
[21:45:24] <danheberden> append( e1, e2, e3 )
[21:45:30] <datarecall> if your switching the background image is there a way to preload the image ?
[21:45:39] <zivester> oh my bad.. i didn't see the optional [content] syntax
[21:45:42] <datarecall> like on click change bg, but youw ould want to preload it no ?
[21:45:53] <danheberden> wangdoo, it'd be good if you can make a reduced case for that on jsfiddle.net
[21:46:26] <danheberden> http://css-tricks.com/13414-seriously-just-make-a-jsfiddle/
[21:46:42] <wangdoo> danheberden: You could find a file called tagify.js.You should make some change there.Pls,have a look at it.
[21:47:10] <danheberden> i could, but i'd rather you made a reduced test case :)
[21:47:24] <danheberden> hence the css-tricks.com article :)
[21:47:35] <wangdoo> danheberden: Let me get back to you.I use jsfiddle
[21:47:51] <danheberden>  \o/ that warms my heart :D
[21:48:07] <danheberden> not just me, there are hundreds of others in here that want to help you
[21:48:11] <danheberden> you jsut gotta make it easy for them to
[21:53:47] <wangdoo> danheberden:  Here it is http://jsfiddle.net/npe7C/4/
[21:55:21] <danheberden> wangdoo check out the resources area on the left - i added the javascript from github to test
[21:55:32] <danheberden> see how that works? you can link to any github raw file
[21:56:01] <danheberden> your js has some errors, make your test case work with the tagify.js or whatevs
[21:56:08] <gmansilla> if I want to validate a form right when an input lose focus… what event / method should I read about ?
[21:56:28] <gmansilla> I mean, I want to validate in real time field by field
[21:57:51] <wangdoo> danheberden: I have added and updated my link http://jsfiddle.net/npe7C/6/
[21:58:43] <danheberden> how do you expect it to work when you have vat x instead of var x :p
[21:58:54] <danheberden> like - make it work until the bug you are actually asking about :D
[21:59:25] <danheberden> gmansilla i'd use the validation plugin, but the blur event is what you're after
[21:59:46] <wangdoo> danheberden: It was a typo
[21:59:55] <wangdoo> danheberden: corrected it ,but still the same
[22:00:19] <danheberden> why are you including jquery twice?
[22:01:10] <danheberden> hmph http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/npe7C/8/
[22:01:31] <gmansilla> danheberden: thank you, I thought I needed onChange() but let me read about that plugin
[22:02:06] <danheberden> the plugin does all the onChange/blur/whatever for you
[22:02:11] <danheberden> and you just setup the rules for your form
[22:02:19] <danheberden> totally awesome
[22:02:47] <wangdoo> danheberden: But you link too is only alerting,it is not allowing to i/p tags
[22:03:05] <danheberden> well, you have a few big glaring issues
[22:03:30] <danheberden> like var celID = $(), but then using $( 'celID')
[22:03:31] <coldhead> i have father issues
[22:03:36] <wangdoo> danheberden: What is that
[22:03:47] <wangdoo> coldhead: no onw told it to you.
[22:04:19] <danheberden> wangdoo your code
[22:04:38] <wangdoo> danheberden: Which code?
[22:04:54] <danheberden> the icky part where you're saving the id to use as a selector
[22:05:19] <danheberden> and not only that, you aren't preceeding it with # anyway
[22:05:24] <danheberden> which is an invalid selector
[22:05:34] <danheberden> so you are ending up with an empty jquery object
[22:05:49] <danheberden> use console.log() and see what those vars are ending up as
[22:05:54] <danheberden> so you can see what you need to change :)
[22:12:50] <wangdoo> danheberden:  now,m able to input  http://jsfiddle.net/npe7C/9/  but,after entering one tag and press enter,it should convert to tag and textbox should not move front.when i press space bar ,it should convert to tag and pressing enter key change it to cell with inputted data
[22:13:49] <coldhead> tempsyyy
[22:14:10] <coldhead> Tophennn
[22:15:03] <wangdoo> danheberden: are you looking at my code?
[22:15:24] <zivester> whats the best way to keep a track of the dom for all new elements that have a given class... that i want to execute something for... kinda like the live() function
[22:16:27] <coldhead> there isn't a good way, zivester
[22:18:25] <coldhead> zivester: you could bind to a "dominsertion" event and then .trigger("dominsertion") whenever you add new elements
[22:18:34] <coldhead> it's pretty DIY though
[22:19:07] <wangdoo> danheberden:  you there?
[22:20:01] <zivester> ?dominsertion
[22:20:45] <wangdoo> coldhead:Help me with  my code
[22:20:56] <coldhead> zivester: it's a custom thing, not an existing jQuery thing
[22:21:03] <coldhead> wangdoo: help me with mine!
[22:21:27] <wangdoo> coldhead: with what?You're a valiant in jquery
[22:21:38] <wangdoo> coldhead: I see you here from past two years
[22:22:16] <coldhead> this is my first day, wangdoo
[22:22:22] <wangdoo> coldhead:  now,m able to input  http://jsfiddle.net/npe7C/10/   but,after entering one tag and press enter,it should convert to tag and textbox should not move front.when i press space bar ,it should convert to tag and pressing enter key change it to cell with inputted data
[22:22:25] <zivester> how does one bind a dominsertion event to the DOM ?
[22:22:29] <wangdoo> coldhead: great joke
[22:24:18] <wangdoo> coldhead:  whr am i going wrong?
[22:25:14] <Cork> zivester: some browser implement the dom3 event DOMNodeInserted, but its not really reliable as many browsers don't support it
[22:26:12] <Cork> zivester: so most of the time its better to trigger on when the function adding it is called
[22:29:34] <zivester> so i currently have a helper class i use for all my HTML, and on $(ready) a special function finds these elements and does some stuff to them... later, i want to add more of these elements and execute the same special functions on them
[22:29:45] <zivester> i'd like it to be as autonomous as possible
[22:35:31] <coldhead> zivester: the theory is that if your code is adding elements to the dom, your code can damn well trigger a custom event to notify any interested listeners of that fact
[22:36:57] <wangdoo> coldhead: You do not know the answer
[22:37:21] <coldhead> i don't know anything, wangdoo
[22:37:26] <coldhead> i can't even read your questions
[22:37:38] <wangdoo> coldhead: great attitude.
[22:37:41] <coldhead> it all goes blurry
[22:37:48] <wangdoo> coldhead: keep it up
[22:38:02] <coldhead> i will try
[22:38:04] <coldhead> thanks wangdoo
[22:38:53] <wangdoo> coldhead: You're doing it.Do not say i try
[22:39:06] <coldhead> got it, carrying on
[22:39:07] <wangdoo> coldhead: If you can not answer,can not you atleast tell me
[22:39:49] <coldhead> i am trying to answer, wangdoo
[22:39:55] <coldhead> i am reading my jQuery textbook for the answer
[22:39:57] <coldhead> it is hard
[22:40:11] <coldhead> meanwhile you might try #common-courtesy
[22:41:29] <coldhead> wangdoo: i thing you might be using too much alert()
[22:41:49] <Cork> coldhead: has he done something to justify this treatment?
[22:41:55] <pfft> hey coldhead
[22:42:08] <pfft> coldhead can mete out any kind of treatment

[22:45:23] <bot-t> Stop Being a Help Vampire! http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/
[22:55:00] <wangdoo> coldhead:  great answer.Now,would have given such a great answer.
[22:55:55] <coldhead> english is not my first language, wangdoo
[22:56:03] <coldhead> i can't understand your sarcasm
[22:56:24] <wangdoo> coldhead: better do your work

[22:58:10] <coldhead> strange feelings
[22:58:18] <gnarf> i have feelings that i'll get tired and +q him
[22:58:28] <gnarf> :)
[22:58:31] <danheberden> coldhead's useless help is the best kind
[22:58:49] <gnarf> :)
[22:59:00] <gnarf> hey why is SlexAxton @
[22:59:07] <danheberden> why isn't he
[22:59:36] <coldhead> probably to impress his fiancee
[22:59:39] <gnarf> lolz
[22:59:49] <gnarf> hey hon, i got ops on #jquery!
[22:59:56] <wangdoo> coldhead: useless making fun.lol
[23:00:15] <danheberden> I DID IT RIGHT _o/\o_
[23:00:21] <gnarf> pro modage
[23:00:22] <danheberden> no linkinus menus required
[23:00:28] <gnarf> ?hi5
[23:00:28] <bot-t> ⁵
[23:00:47] <danheberden> ?eval hi5( 'gnarf', 'danheberden' );
[23:00:48] <bot-t> danheberden: "gnarf _o/\o_ danheberden"
[23:02:01] <gnarf> single quotes?
[23:02:12] <gnarf> that isn't up to the #jquery aircoding standards
[23:02:13] <gnarf> lol
[23:03:03] <Deele> space's around parens is a bit wrong too
[23:04:06] <gnarf> Deele: jQuery coding standard
[23:04:37] <gnarf> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[23:05:36] <Deele> but why those spaces needed?
[23:05:43] <danheberden> Because I like them
[23:05:51] <Deele> jslint says bad words about them too
[23:05:58] <danheberden> jslint can suck my jscock
[23:06:14] <danheberden> that'd be a cool lib, jscock.js
[23:06:24] <danheberden> or just cock.js
[23:06:30] <Deele> js.cock
[23:06:50] <danheberden> any more cock files on my computer, i might get a virus
[23:07:10] <RubyTN> I have some code that looks like this in my site:  http://jsfiddle.net/qkA4j/7/  I am able to hide the associated div when its associated submiut input is clicked.  I am having trouble when all of it's associated/children divs are hidden.  So in the example, if you hide all of Aerosmith's songs, I need to hide the parent div that has the text 'Aerosmith.  How can I do this?'
[23:07:19] <gnarf> Deele: http://cl.ly/2t2H2M3s0C470b0p1C34
[23:07:45] <Deele> main functionallity is around methods of splatting all over monitor, some random generated plygons with round corners, filled with #fff color
[23:08:00] <danheberden> Deele ha
[23:08:02] <gnarf> http://html5cocks.com
[23:08:24] <danheberden> so THOSE are the native html5 programming patterns ms was talking about
[23:10:14] <RubyTN> any ideas?
[23:16:19] <Tophen> oh hey wait it might be workin now :)
[23:16:55] <coldhead> cool story, Tophen
[23:17:13] <Tophen> oh crap wrong chat :(
[23:17:33] <Deele> an who the fcuk tought people set up if (cond) { then \n} else { \n Why not if (cond) {\n then \n}\n else { \n else \n}
[23:18:16] <Tophen> ^my brain just exploded
[23:18:34] <Deele> use creativity part, it has bigger RAM
[23:18:46] <Deele> I hope...
[23:19:26] <Deele> "else/else if/catch go on the same line as the brace" is wrong...
[23:19:41] <Deele> why not use another \n between brace and keyword...
[23:19:53] <RubyTN> coldhead:   I have some code that looks like this in my site:  http://jsfiddle.net/qkA4j/7/  I am able to hide the associated div when its associated submiut input is clicked.

How can I do this?'
[23:20:19] <twoface> Deele, "why not do [...]" is hardly an argument to it
[23:20:39] <twoface> I would counter-argue with "why should I?"
[23:21:04] <Deele> twoface, those are two different parts, one ends previous block, another starts a new one, why in same line
[23:21:38] <twoface> I think its easier to read, and provides nice squared blocks of code
[23:22:15] <twoface> And you don't miss that you have an "else", which you might when your "if" ends on a line of its own
[23:22:47] <Deele> I guess, I'm not only one, who thinks like this...
[23:22:57] <twoface> I know :)
[23:23:42] <twoface> There are other coding styles that are better suited for discussion, imho
[23:23:54] <twoface> Like this legacy system I'm supporting, where all database tables are postfixed _t
[23:24:01] <twoface> So we can see that it is a table...
[23:34:22] <donCams> hi
[23:34:31] <Deele> RubyTN, dont wait for him, he is cold... try this http://jsfiddle.net/Deele/qkA4j/8/
[23:35:34] <donCams> i have this code http://pastebin.com/aerUdfnG, which is actually taken from my code that is 'procedural'
[23:35:39] <gnarf> Deele: after being forced to code in it for a while, the jQuery style is becoming natural
[23:35:45] <gnarf> and i think it reads really cleanly
[23:35:58] <donCams> line 80 returns 0 but my 'procedural' code returns the correct height
[23:36:00] <twoface> gzncimgreel ? :/
[23:36:16] <donCams> nope
[23:36:33] <donCams> different :)
[23:36:34] <twoface> Was just thinking, what a strange function name
[23:36:49] <donCams> it's the name of the project i'm working on
[23:37:24] <donCams> prototype starts at line 15... heh
[23:37:42] <Deele> gnarf, just don't like when people overuse something, but when its really needed, can't put another newline after brace...
[23:37:45] <donCams> just wondering why line 80 would return 0
[23:38:33] <donCams> line 111 here http://pastebin.com/S5axF4H3 returns the correct height
[23:41:16] <donCams> anybody? :(
[23:41:36] <Deele> donCams, what's up?
[23:41:47] <gnarf> "really needed" ?
[23:42:08] <gnarf> } else { has >ALWAYS< felt more natural than }\n else \n { to me
[23:42:17] <donCams> hey Deele, http://pastebin.com/aerUdfnG line 80 returns 0
[23:42:34] <donCams> while its original code http://pastebin.com/S5axF4H3 line 111 returns correct height
[23:42:35] <gnarf> even when "code complete" or whatever antiquated 90's teaching material i was tought suggested otherwise
[23:42:36] <Deele> gnarf, no, dont put \n after else, just before else :)
[23:42:36] <donCams> any idea why?
[23:43:05] <gnarf> Deele: that would like trip me out to see code written that way
[23:43:08] <danheberden> donCams i'm guessing there's shit in there that hasn't loaded yet?
[23:43:15] <gnarf> }\n else {
[23:43:16] <danheberden> is that height explicitely set via css?
[23:43:25] <donCams> danheberden, nope
[23:43:30] <danheberden> or is there an image or something in it that make it that height
[23:43:37] <gnarf> Deele: does any OS project actually use that?
[23:43:53] <danheberden> i tried the else on a new line for a bit
[23:43:56] <danheberden> just felt weird
[23:44:00] <Deele> gnarf, you are wise one here :P you say...
[23:44:03] <danheberden> and it's like, bleh, another fucking line
[23:44:04] <danheberden> haha
[23:44:29] <danheberden> As long as you're consistent with whatever style you use
[23:44:34] <gnarf> danheberden: yeah, it'd be like that time you showed up in my dream.... awkward
[23:44:35] <gnarf> ;)
[23:44:35] <danheberden> _thats_ all that matters
[23:44:44] <danheberden> gnarf i no, that was crazy
[23:44:46] <danheberden> *know
[23:45:05] <gnarf> Deele: i don't know, i've never seen that style used in any of the projects i've worked on
[23:45:27] <gnarf> which i guess is reason enough to think that you're weird for preferring it ;)
[23:45:27] <Deele> I'm thinking about writing code guidelines for projects I develop, for my programmers, that is why, I'm curious
[23:45:36] <gnarf> Deele: do it now! :)
[23:45:45] <gnarf> Deele: standards project wide are important
[23:45:49] <donCams> danheberden, it's the same code. the other one just being 'more oop'
[23:46:04] <gnarf> if not, the shit falls apart and gets REALLY hard to read if no standards are enforced
[23:46:12] <iamthawlrs> Greetings all.  I'm new to this, so the syntax is pretty greek to me... I've only pasted the js/jquery, if you need more, please ask.  http://jsfiddle.net/2ufzw/1/       I'm using a simple jquery tabs script, but I'm trying to get one of the tabs to open an external link, instead of opening a tab.  I've commented out my sorry attempt at makng it work.  Any suggestion?
[23:46:13] <Deele> ofcourse...
[23:47:00] <danheberden> donCams: but the code doesn't show the markup
[23:47:17] <danheberden> so is there an explicit height on the container or no?
[23:47:25] <danheberden> is there content that is possibly still loading when that code fires?
[23:47:31] <danheberden> thus, making it 0 height
[23:47:44] <danheberden> and one happens to fire quick enough that it beats the image loading or something?
[23:47:52] <danheberden> while the other muddles long enough to be behind the load
[23:47:55] <gnarf> but yeah, consistency is more important than the points in the standard imo :)
[23:48:30] <gnarf> personally, i set my own standards really ow
[23:49:00] <ch3t4n> Hello
[23:49:43] <Deele> I'm perfectionist, that is why it turns me up, seeing some programmer under my nose, "ruining" my own code... I need to either set my standarts precisely or get used to it...
[23:49:48] <donCams> danheberden, forgive my 'noobishness' but would $('#something').load('page.php', function() {} ) mean that everything has loaded in the callback?
[23:50:01] <danheberden> nope
[23:50:06] <donCams> crap
[23:50:08] <danheberden> it means that markup did
[23:50:15] <danheberden> and it's getting injected into the dom
[23:50:29] <donCams> so just the markup and not the whole content?
[23:50:42] <Deele> RubyTN, did this solved your case? try this http://jsfiddle.net/Deele/qkA4j/8/
[23:50:53] <donCams> back to zero for me on prefetching content
[23:50:57] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded
[23:50:58] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() jquery plugin  Gist - https://gist.github.com/268257
[23:52:37] <RubyTN> Deele:  Thanks, works like a charm
[23:53:11] <Tophen> are you home tonight?
[23:53:13] <coldhead> Deele is one of the good ones
[23:53:35] <Deele> coldhead, 0:)
[23:53:45] <m4rtijn> hi all
[23:53:56] <Deele> hi half of all
[23:54:04] <m4rtijn> does anyone know a nice effect for tag clouds?
[23:54:30] <Deele> nice effect, like - no effects, just cloud?
[23:54:50] <m4rtijn> some animated mouseover effect
[23:55:35] <Deele> you can use any mouseover effect you like, to ruin any tag cloud, that is already handling too much information
[23:55:54] <iamthawlrs> Anyone have any thoughts on my tabs issue?
[23:56:10] <Deele> I better get back to work...
[23:57:09] <m4rtijn> Deele: good point Deele, thanks
[23:57:44] <Deele> gnarf, have you worked with something like http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/ ?
[23:58:12] <gnarf> Deele: actually I think I'm going to submit a pull to fix the core .animate() loop to be a setTimeout instead of an Interval
[23:59:03] <Deele> that exact piece of code is little bit errournous, but in any case, it stops after about 10 loops, with no visible reason
