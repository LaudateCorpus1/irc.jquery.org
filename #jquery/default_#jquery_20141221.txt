[00:06:17] <toothe> alright, I can't get jQuery to .show()/.hide() a certain field.
[00:24:26] <ash_m> is there a way to execute a function when any ajax request is made?
[00:25:32] <ash_m> or I guess, a specific one...
[00:25:56] <ash_m> I have a div that sizes based on a floating div next to it
[00:26:54] <toothe> yes...
[00:26:58] <ash_m> it needs to resize when an ajax form is made
[00:27:01] <toothe> ajax is nothing but a function being executed.
[00:27:05] <ash_m> it's a search result
[00:27:43] <ash_m> toothe: well.. I kinda need to add the execution of this function to the end of the ajax request, right?
[00:28:13] <ash_m> toothe: otherwise, when the page changes; it will still result in the default height/width values;
[00:28:28] <ash_m> toothe: so how do I go about doing that?
[00:28:44] <toothe> right.
[00:28:47] <toothe> so, just put the function there...
[00:28:54] <toothe> cna you show me your current code?
[00:29:03] <toothe> btw, im not a jQuery expert by any means
[00:29:32] <ash_m> toothe: erm; it's built into the cms
[00:29:46] <toothe> oh...hm...so you can't modify it?
[00:29:47] <toothe> or can?
[00:29:47] <ash_m> toothe: so; I'd rather not hack the js files for it
[00:29:57] <toothe> so..you can't do anything, no?
[00:30:09] <ash_m> toothe: I'm sure I could, but that would probably be considered  bad practice
[00:30:44] <toothe> okay
[00:30:47] <toothe> i'd need to see your code then
[00:32:04] <ash_m> toothe: which code; the code that executes the ajax request?
[00:32:39] <toothe> whatever code you're trying to modify...
[00:34:31] <wa5ted> toothe: what you mean
[00:35:08] <toothe> ash_m: what do you need?
[00:35:24] <toothe> wa5ted: I figured it out.
[00:35:29] <wa5ted> kk
[00:36:14] <gtristan> question: at what moment can I rely on the value returned by $(node).width() ?
[00:36:38] <toothe> if I run a selector that has multiple results, can I do a foreach on them?
[00:36:38] <ash_m> toothe: well it's based on the Drupal platform, I think I will have to to do some digging to get the right code out
[00:36:53] <toothe> ash_m: im not sure how to help you then....i mean, I need to see what you want to modify.
[00:37:05] <ash_m> toothe: not sure if this will cause scope problems as my code in particular is not in even in the same directory
[00:37:35] <gtristan> I was naively operating under the expectation that a div's computed width will be, well, computed... after the moment it is inserted into the scenegraph and is 'displayed' (i.e. CSS 'display' property is not 'none')
[00:37:35] <ash_m> I think it might have something to do with Drupal.behaviours
[02:00:34] <k_tracke1> does somebody know why jquery ui .tabs() shows more than one tab div? http://i.gyazo.com/0e4585036b4784d757165d9f044d6a78.png

[02:54:35] <TeddyMurray> how do i change a checkbox state with a jquery attr?
[02:54:43] <TeddyMurray> a jquery mobile checkbox
[02:54:49] <TeddyMurray> im trying to programmatically change it
[02:55:22] <wa5ted> TeddyMurray: attr isnt used .prop is used
[02:56:01] <TeddyMurray> wa5ted, http://pastebin.com/YQxnx2eD
[02:56:08] <TeddyMurray> tried prop too

[03:45:20] <Imaginativeone> good morning :-)
[03:46:03] <Imaginativeone> I am using a tab widget.
[03:47:08] <Imaginativeone> I would like to put some text content into a variable, and place it in th
[03:47:26] <Imaginativeone> the spot where my tab header is.
[03:47:41] <Imaginativeone> how do I accomplish that?
[05:30:10] <clearcut> hello i have two characters "[" and "]" i want to match anny occurance of certin string between these two - so i have (\[)(_someStringToMatch_)(\],) - how do i do match all ocurances of certain strgin between two characters (or strings)?
[06:06:43] <mrbubbles> hi guys, if you use var element = $(‘.element’).clone() and then later append the element, will it be in the state at which it was cloned, it (if you make further changes to it in the dom) the state at which you append it?
[08:01:51] <BeWilled> hello: is this selector ok for an image that is two generations down from the specified class ? $('.myclass > img')
[08:02:38] <wa5ted> BeWilled: wut 0.0?
[08:02:57] <wa5ted> if you are talking about teh grandchild of .myclass
[08:02:58] <wa5ted> no
[08:03:17] <wa5ted> youll neeed .myclass > [...] > img
[08:03:20] <wa5ted> BeWilled: ^
[08:03:54] <BeWilled> wa5ted, ie: <div class="myClass"><div><div><img/></div></div></div>
[08:04:15] <wa5ted> BeWilled:  remember > targets the immediate children
[08:04:20] <wa5ted> if you wanna acess img
[08:04:23] <wa5ted> then either do
[08:04:57] <wa5ted> .myClass img    -----OR------ .myClass > div > div > img
[08:05:13] <BeWilled> thats so good to know
[08:06:13] <wa5ted> BeWilled: remember you can chain > and blanks together
[08:06:23] <wa5ted> eg. .myClass div > img
[08:06:32] <wa5ted> ^that works too
[08:06:40] <BeWilled> cool
[08:06:41] <BeWilled> thank you very much for clarifying the concept for me
[08:08:03] <wa5ted> :)
[08:39:42] <BeWilled> Is there a way to list the jquery plugins which are loaded? I included the cookie plugin which worked well
[08:40:12] <BeWilled> but trying to use mlens right now and get unefined is not a function when calling $().mlens
[08:43:28] <BillCriswell> BeWilled: You can type: jQuery. in the dev tools and the autocomplete thing will list everything.
[08:50:01] <quarters> hello. I seem to be having issues with a slideshow that I've created getting stuck on the 2nd of 5 slides. The gist is here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c9abb0cd11949f335f24
[09:10:58] <jiffe> so I'm playing with jqplot/ohlc and I noticed if the series is flat it is either displayed on the far bottom or far top and hidden by the chart border, I don't know if anyone knows a way to center it
[11:40:58] <quentusrex> I found that I'm often creating html forms, linking them to a rest api for PUT, POST, and GET functions. Is there a query module that automates these actions? filling in the table from a GET to the rest API, linking a CREATE button to a POST, a Delete button to a DELETE, and an Update button to the PUT?
[11:45:30] <CssNoob> good night and good morning y'all
[12:03:52] <strio_> Hello
[12:04:29] <strio_> Using jQuery.getScript to get example.js fails if example.js contain <script> tags, is there anyway to fix it? thank you
[12:07:04] <codechewing> strio_: what is the content of example.js?
[12:10:10] <strio_> codechewing: for example, something like this
[12:10:11] <strio_> http://pastebin.com/WivarQez
[12:11:09] <codechewing> strio_: you don't need the script tags in example.js
[12:12:05] <codechewing> strio_: simply remove them, amd try $.getScript again
[12:12:05] <strio_> codechewing: I need that, becaus i need to do $('body').append(data); and I want to have the script tags and others thinks, since is a script like google analytics formart
[12:12:54] <strio_> yes, without script works as expected, but I need to do full snipped code, even with comments too.
[12:16:03] <strio_> codechewing: I dont know how to adding 8(
[12:21:24] <Nyoom> How can I select a image by src path?
[12:28:52] <strio_> codechewing: maybe using .load instead?
[12:31:08] <codechewing> strio_: I don't think jQuery.getScript is what you want then - as that will attempt to execute the returned data (js)
[12:33:27] <codechewing> strio_: instead, try something like this: http://jsbin.com/fozepirizi/1/edit?html
[12:35:22] <strio_> codechewing: I only see a machine doing loops heheh
[12:35:44] <strio_> ah just finished!
[12:49:02] <StephenS> how can I check if string have var str = "(x) staticText", where x is INT.
[12:50:45] <strio_> codechewing: Thanks!, seems to work better now, the problem is if I have this scrippt, it waits forever to load iframe, example
[12:50:48] <strio_> http://pastebin.com/ezcknnsg
[12:54:49] <StephenS> anyone?
[13:09:50] <strio_> codechewing: the forever loop if have document.write iframe it happends to you?
[13:18:27] <Voyage> Is there a way to convert the page view to a png or jpg?
[13:18:43] <arthurvr> phantomJS can do that
[13:18:59] <arthurvr> http://phantomjs.org/screen-capture.html
[13:21:18] <arthurvr> Does that help?
[13:22:44] <Voyage> let me se
[13:23:34] <arthurvr> voyage: or does it need to be client-side?
[13:24:15] <Voyage> am.. I just have a local html page and want to convert it to a pdf. but its heavy in graphics
[13:24:24] <Voyage> firefox or chrome do it wronge
[13:24:36] <arthurvr> well phantom might help then
[13:24:38] <arthurvr> just the cli
[13:27:50] <Voyage> hm ok
[13:28:37] <Voyage> arthurvr can It also convert html to pdf?
[13:29:00] <arthurvr> from the link it sent you: ”Beside PNG format, PhantomJS supports JPEG, GIF, and PDF.”
[13:29:12] <Voyage> oh ok
[13:29:19] <arthurvr> ;-)
[13:31:44] <Voyage> arthurvr page.open('http://github.com/', function() {   can be  page.open('mylocalfile.html', function() {
[13:31:45] <Voyage> ?
[13:32:26] <arthurvr> Depends where you’re going to execute your node script…
[13:32:42] <arthurvr> but in same dir page.open(‘./mylocalfile.html’, fun
[13:37:02] <Rongie_> Hi! Really hoping someone here can't give me some pointers. I'm using toggleClass to show/hide a menu, but on mobile the class change only fires after I perform a scroll. Does anyone now how to fix that?
[13:37:15] <Voyage> arthurvr I have index.html, pdf.js and phantom.exe in same dir. I ran phantom.exe and typed pdf.js but it says "cant find variable: pdf" what can be wrong?
[13:39:01] <arthurvr> what’s in pdf.js?
[13:39:47] <Voyage> var page = require('webpage').create();
[13:39:48] <Voyage> page.open('index.html', function() {
[13:39:48] <Voyage>   page.render('pdf.jpg');
[13:39:48] <Voyage>   phantom.exit();
[13:39:48] <Voyage> });
[13:40:28] <Voyage> arthurvr this is^
[13:41:14] <arthurvr> why don’t you just use the cli btw?
[13:43:20] <Voyage> I am using cli by executing phantom.exe
[13:44:17] <arthurvr> that’s weird
[13:47:26] <Voyage>  if PhantomJS is invoked without any argument, it will enter the interactive mode (REPL)
[13:47:29] <Voyage> I got it now
[13:47:38] <Voyage> http://phantomjs.org/api/command-line.html'
[13:47:43] <hwamokp66> http://hatching.hpcreatives.net  I'm trying to figure out why my navigation is scorlling to random parts and how to slow down my slider
[14:29:13] <quentusrex> anyone know of a form ajax plugin? I keep having to build the same ~200-400 lines for every form, and I assume by now someone would have built a plugin for it.
[14:29:33] <quentusrex> something like datatables, but for forms.
[14:34:10] <BillCriswell> quentusrex: I'm not following.
[14:35:20] <quentusrex> BillCriswell, I keep creating forms in html, then having to write some JS to fill out the form details, then some more js to handle the ajax form submit
[14:36:00] <quentusrex> I've seen several jquery plugins for form serialization, others for form validation, but non to handle the defaults of filling in form default values, etc.
[14:36:30] <quentusrex> BillCriswell, the use case is to expose a bunch of REST api's for standard objects
[14:36:35] <BillCriswell> You mea like autofill?
[14:43:33] <toothe> is there a way to open a window.open in jquery? I was told that its bad to set the onchange= directly in the DOM.
[15:14:12] <TeddyMurray> if you dynamically change a jquery mobile site, how do you get jquery mobile to parse the elements?
[15:24:16] <strio_> its possible to load a file using ajax that contains a document.write iframe? it loops forvever if I use this.
[15:24:32] <strio_> but is an external js code that client wants it to do tracking..
[15:34:12] <leporello> Hi. I have a forum with posts which have .content class. I want to do some typo changes on the fly. Soft hyphens, (c), (R), ... and so on. How can I attach event to all elements of .content class to run some code after their load. I have now all this stuff after load of all document but I don't like it.
[15:34:33] <leporello> I missed "?" :)
[15:36:20] <fiberhopllc> Could someone lead me in the correct direction (because the console isn't helping) why this isn't working:  http://laravel.io/bin/bEq8J
[15:40:34] <leporello> fiberhoppllc it doesn't like tablecloth function.
[15:42:47] <leporello> fiberhopllc if you want it you need to include tablecloth plugin, but you included only tableSorter
[16:00:22] <fiberhopllc> Any help would be appreciated  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27595049/jquery-sortable-table-problems-laravel
[16:11:34] <leporello> fiberhopllc, do you see me?
[16:11:49] <leporello> Chrome throws an error on tablecloth function
[16:12:05] <leporello> Line 219
[16:15:21] <fiberhopllc> ah
[16:15:29] <fiberhopllc> That's odd.
[18:35:54] <alexclark> is there a way to test if a page has a scroll event?
[18:36:48] <alexclark> I have a page thats scrolling kinda clunky on mobile and my first thought is there's an expensive scroll event i dont know about
[18:41:52] <djpm05> I have a form that I'm hopping to ajax-ify using the jquery form plugin, and it seems like it'll POST the request and load the page before I can figure out why it's not doing the AJAX request itself. I'd love to get some guidance on how to troubleshoot that kind of issue
[18:45:10] <alexclark> djpm05: have you tried e.preventDefault() on the submit button?
[18:45:18] <djpm05> Alex, If you can open the code up you could parse through the javascript and see if anything is using the .scroll event. If it's on a linux server you have access to you could go to the document root and run something like: grep 'scroll' *
[18:46:06] <djpm05> I wasn't sure how to add that into the jquery form plugin, it has that as something it requires when you do an ajaxSubmit, but .ajaxForm doesn't seem to require it
[18:47:15] <alexclark> djpm05: its on shopify and theres a handful of libraries included, so i was hoping there was something easier
[18:48:27] <alexclark> djpm05: is this the plugin youre using? http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
[18:48:38] <djpm05> yessir!
[18:49:07] <djpm05> Which phone are you seeing scroll issues with? I have a bunch of devices I can take a look at if you'd like
[18:50:03] <alexclark> a nexus4 and i think it wasnt great on an iphone
[18:50:37] <alexclark> i think the issue has been seen enough to warrant some fix, but thanks for the offer!
[18:50:53] <djpm05> what's really odd is I have the same code on its own and it responds exactly how I would expect, but when it's inside of the site I'm developing it doesn't seem to work, but I can't find a good way to figure out if there's a conflict with another script, etc.
[18:52:46] <djpm05> no problem, if you happen to have access to a linux box there are some wget commands you can run to archive the site, and grep through them which would be a lot more efficient than trying to search through each script
[18:52:53] <alexclark> djpm05: have you tried using a timeout option?
[18:53:37] <djpm05> I haven't, let me try that now!
[18:58:25] <djpm05> doesn't seem to have any affect. I used the example here: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#ajaxForm and uncommented the timeout value on it
[18:59:15] <alexclark> i assume you double checked the selector?
[18:59:33] <alexclark> if you want to share a url i can put a second set of eyes on it
[18:59:47] <djpm05> I'll definitely check again, just to be absolutely sure :)
[19:00:30] <djpm05> http://staging.remsymusic.com this is the site, when you click on the + sign it pops up a form to add your name and email to an active campaign mailing list, feel free to use junk data so you won't be added to the list itself
[19:02:40] <djpm05> I also made sure that the jquery script and jquery.form script are both loaded before the 'zzz_ajax_submit2.js' file is, thinking maybe it was that
[19:02:47] <spudzee> I need a bit of help interfacing my python script with my javascript / html
[19:03:17] <djpm05> I'm sure I'm doing something stupid.
[19:03:58] <alexclark> the timeout is causing an error because of a missing comma
[19:04:05] <djpm05> oh shoot…
[19:04:41] <spudzee> I have a python function: search(query) and it returns value query. How can I use jquery to call the function with a parameter?
[19:04:43] <djpm05> ok fixed that, let me check and make sure I don't have any other unbalanced quotes or missing line terminators
[19:05:17] <spudzee> query is a list in python terms and an array in js
[19:05:27] <spudzee> should be an array in js*
[19:06:31] <spudzee> I guess if someone could just link a doc that explains how to do this, that would be great
[19:08:16] <djpm05> is the python code serverside?
[19:08:46] <toothe> python as a web framework would always be server side.
[19:09:05] <spudzee> no. It's a document sitting in a folder with a .py at the end of it
[19:09:51] <spudzee> I've heard I need to use XML but I couldn't ever find a quickstart or a decent tutorial
[19:12:13] <spudzee> let me make a jsfiddle real quick
[19:15:52] <spudzee> I'm feeling a bit bla today, so my question didn't really make sense :( . I have something I found on stackoverflow, and it doesn't work probably because of my amateur web design skills.
[19:17:43] <alexclark> djpm05: it doesn't seem to be fixed
[19:18:50] <djpm05> sorry, forgot to save it in vim:)
[19:19:29] <alexclark> haha no worries
[19:19:50] <djpm05> jquery would be client-side, and would have to make some kind of HTTP request (GET, POST, etc) for it to hit the python script, and then you'd just parse out the query string/data, if I'm thinking about this properly
[19:20:26] <alexclark> djpm05: now theres a missing } at the end of the file
[19:20:52] <spudzee> so I'm not too familiar with the input system for html. http://jsfiddle.net/ypeau15k/ please don't just me :(( . I want it where, when you press the submit button, it will call my python function called search(query) with the content of the input tag as the query parameter. Then it should alert you the result of my python function. The problem is, I have no idea how to go about any of this :((
[19:21:13] <spudzee> that was the wrong link
[19:21:29] <spudzee> http://jsfiddle.net/ypeau15k/2/
[19:22:28] <djpm05> alax let me balance all of the quotes, I took that example code and I should have made it myself, just a moment :)
[19:22:29] <spudzee> the jquery bit was copied off of a stack overflow, so I really don't understand how it works.
[19:23:03] <alexclark> spudzee: that call would need to be done via http request
[19:23:25] <alexclark> you would need a server to handle this http request
[19:24:20] <alexclark> sorry gotta run
[19:24:41] <djpm05> Thanks for the help alex!
[19:25:35] <djpm05> spudzee, are you running windows on the computer that has the python file?
[19:25:42] <spudzee> okay... do you have a link to some docs that could explain all of this to me?
[19:25:52] <djpm05> Let me find one for you
[19:26:17] <spudzee> no I have a mac
[19:26:30] <spudzee> running yosemite to be precise
[19:26:42] <djpm05> you might want to use something like this: http://www.mamp.info/en/
[19:27:05] <djpm05> that'll setup a webserver on your mac that you can make requests to
[19:27:18] <spudzee> If it's that big of deal I do have a windows machine I use mostly for gaming
[19:27:42] <djpm05> mac should work just find for this kind of thing
[19:27:55] <djpm05> this looks like a good doc for explaining what an HTTP server does: http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/text/http-tut.html
[19:28:19] <spudzee> sorry, crashed
[19:28:34] <djpm05> This looks like a good doc for explaining what an HTTP server does: http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/text/http-tut.html
[19:29:21] <djpm05> when you view a website the webserver will execute the code and handle all of the logic in that code
[19:31:07] <spudzee> sounds good so far
[19:31:14] <djpm05> you'll probably just need to configure a webserver, make sure it can handle the python script as an executable, and then change the 'url' parameter to something like 127.0.0.1/pythonthing.py, assuming you set the document root to D:\My Data\Desktop\Programs\Project 1\
[19:31:36] <spudzee> k
[19:32:14] <djpm05> there are other languages such as PHP that you can use pretty easily, I'm sure someone will correct me here, but when I see python being used serverside it's usually as a CGI
[19:32:53] <djpm05> this is from the python website that explains some of what I'm talking about: https://docs.python.org/2/howto/webservers.html
[19:34:19] <djpm05> I would start out configuring the webserver and making sure you can load a static file (ie. going to your browser and typing in 127.0.0.1/index.html), then move on to creating a simple python script to respond, which is mentioned in the last link I sent
[19:34:20] <spudzee> what's a CGI, sorry, I don't read fast; so docs take me awhile
[19:34:43] <spudzee> I am reading the doc you linked though
[19:35:33] <djpm05> no problem, a CGI is a "Common Gateway Interface", importantly the server runs the script each time a request is made to that script
[19:36:55] <djpm05> so if you had something like helloworld.py, all of the code in that document would be executed and just result in the browser showing "Hello World!", that's the most common script you can run and it validates that your request is getting to the webserver correctly, and that the CGI is being executed rather than just displayed.
[19:39:52] <djpm05> Here is an example of the script in the article I linked you to running on my webserver: http://spidertaffy.com/cgi-bin/helloworld.py
[19:41:17] <spudzee> what's the difference between HTTP, CGI, PHP, and XML. Don't they all do the same thing?
[19:42:10] <djpm05> HTTP is a protocol used for websites, CGI and PHP are programming languages, and XML is a structured data format
[19:43:41] <mdev> is CGI a programming language?
[19:44:05] <djpm05> when your browser makes a request to pull up a website it will send data to that server like "GET /index.php HTTP/1.1" saying "give me the page /index.php" That is the HTTP stage of the website. The index.php file may have something like <?php echo "hello world"; ?> and it will respond to the browser with just the text "hello world"
[19:44:29] <mdev> Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard method used to generate dynamic content on Web pages and Web applications. CGI, when implemented on a Web server, provides an interface between the Web server and programs that generate the Web content. These programs are known as CGI scripts or simply CGIs; they are usually written in a scripting language, but can be written in any programming
[19:44:29] <mdev> language.
[19:44:40] <djpm05> CGI is a way of executing code on a webserver. It's not used as heavily as it used to be, as a lot of webservers can natively run the code rather than having to create a shell and execute the code
[19:45:08] <mdev> webservers can natively run the code lol eh?
[19:45:18] <djpm05> ok I didn't phrase that well
[19:45:19] <djpm05> hah
[19:45:38] <mdev> yeah i'm just being difficult, i'll stop :p
[19:45:44] <djpm05> I mean something like apache using mod-php and not having to create a subshell as the apache user to execute it
[19:45:46] <djpm05> haha
[19:46:05] <djpm05> no I appreciate the correction, I don't want to give out bad information
[19:48:17] <djpm05> on the jquery problem I was running into, when I have my form just loading jquery, jquery.form, and posting to the same form it works with AJAX without any problems, but on the main site it stops functioning and does a full request to that page. Is there a good way for me to figure out if there's a script conflict, or something stupid I'm doing in my code?
[19:51:35] <djpm05> I don't think it's a jquery or server issue, because it's working on the same domain under a different folder, but I can't for the life of me find any kind of errors or information on why it's not stopping the submit from happening on the browser, and instead submitting the AJAX query.
[19:53:02] <mdev> try $("#whatever_form").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault();
[19:53:26] <mdev> also try using chrome and right click and inspect, see if any console errors or network errors as in files not found
[19:56:16] <Mark_2> can anyone help me figure out what kind of navigation this is: http://themeforest.unitedthemes.com/wpversions/brooklyn/landing/
[19:56:19] <djpm05> just tried that, it doesn't seem to get to that point. I have an alert in there and it doesn't get there either
[19:58:37] <djpm05> Mark are you referring to the top menu with "Start", "Key Features" etc?
[19:59:04] <djpm05> or the little gear on the left side of that page?
[19:59:05] <Mark_2> yes.
[19:59:18] <Mark_2> no, not the toggle menu
[19:59:29] <Mark_2> the navigation bar is scrolled down as i scroll down to certain point
[19:59:34] <Mark_2> i can’t figure out where to start.
[19:59:48] <djpm05> ahhh yes! http://stickyjs.com
[19:59:53] <Mark_2> http://abercrombie.com has the same kind of navigation
[20:00:06] <mdev> djpm
[20:00:39] <mdev> the form isn't being called?
[20:01:02] <mdev> you sure you have the right id and <form id="whatever"></form> ?
[20:01:07] <djpm05> it doesn't seem like it's ever getting to the $('#subscribe_form').submit(function(e) { part of the code
[20:01:18] <Mark_2> and it’s not just the sticky
[20:01:32] <mdev> well check for console errors, chrome pretty good at that
[20:01:36] <djpm05> yep, I just checked the form ID and name and made sure to copy/paste
[20:01:48] <mdev> also my ghetto erro checking would be alerts before it got there
[20:01:53] <mdev> to see how far it goes before it fails :p
[20:02:32] <mdev> or console.log's whatever you like
[20:02:46] <djpm05> the only ones I'm seeing are the console.log messages, I added to the code, some FB.init errors, and some mixed SSL/non-SSL content errors and a few missing images, but they're expected.
[20:02:47] <mdev> if you're dynamically creating the form
[20:03:00] <mdev> you may need to listen for the form submit event little different
[20:04:04] <djpm05> it's definitely showing the document ready part of the code is good, I put the standard $(this).hide(); logic in there just to make sure standard jquery stuff was loading, then right after that is when it binds to the form and past that the logs are silent, very odd
[20:04:41] <djpm05> also made sure that jquery and jquery.form are both being loaded prior to my script, and it attaches after the dom is ready.. I'm sure it's something stupid I'm doing
[20:05:28] <djpm05> Mark, a lot of the stuff I'm seeing on that first theme you send me seems like CSS styling stuff, what functionality are you trying to duplicate?
[20:05:42] <djpm05> sent me* can't type today, yikes.
[20:06:15] <Mark_2> pretty much just this whole webpage : http://themeforest.unitedthemes.com/wpversions/brooklyn/landing/
[20:06:37] <Mark_2> im not sure if im getting it right though : http://jsfiddle.net/gocsyebt/3/
[20:07:25] <toothe> how do you get the value within a tag? For example, <span>This text</span>, how would I Get "This text" ?
[20:07:43] <Woet> toothe: http://api.jquery.com/text/
[20:08:16] <toothe> oh, i was doing .text, not .text()
[20:08:17] <toothe> silly me.
[20:11:47] <djpm05> mdev, thanks for the help! I am going to keep troubleshooting tomorrow
[20:12:17] <mdev> nice! hope you find the answer :)
[20:27:47] <DroneX> Hello world
[22:09:49] <Chulbul> I'm using highcharts.js(highstockchart), I have to display line chart representation of ranks, now rank 1 will display line to the bottom than the value with rank two. Is it possible to make it work as if rank one line is higher than rank two.
[22:11:21] <mdev> Chulbul that's a pretty specific question, honestly I think the best chance of you getting help is possibly googling what you need, and if all fails then contact highcharts creator, as I know that isn't free so they should be able to offer some sort of assistance
[22:11:34] <mdev> but google pay provide fruit if you word things just right
[22:11:51] <mdev> i've googled probably hours trying to get flot chart stuff working
[22:12:18] <Chulbul> hmm ok
[22:34:51] <nikio_> hey i would ike to update an items field in my database based on the id of the item edited by the user, and some random attributed edited.. so i thought about using this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/22806301
