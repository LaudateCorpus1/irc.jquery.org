[01:42:37] <robertmaxrees> snatcher there's no such thing as an associative array in JS.
[01:42:43] <robertmaxrees> there are arrays, and there are objects.
[01:42:47] <robertmaxrees> but to associative arrays.
[01:42:50] <robertmaxrees> *no
[01:55:39] <pavonia> How are JS objects different from associative arrays?
[01:57:44] <robertmaxrees> they're similar, but they don't necessarily meet the classic definition of associative arrays.
[01:57:51] <robertmaxrees> in JS, they're just objects.
[01:58:13] <Cork> for one it doesn't have .length
[01:58:17] <robertmaxrees> ^
[01:58:28] <robertmaxrees> nor all the methods.
[02:00:52] <robertmaxrees> keep in mind the fundamentals of JS are quite different from most other languages.  even the underlying inheritence mechanism isn't true "prototypes"
[02:00:58] <robertmaxrees> more like "behavior delegation"
[02:04:41] <pavonia> Wikipedia seems to disagree, they also list JS as a language that has them built-in
[02:04:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[02:05:36] <robertmaxrees> wikipedia lumps associative arrays, maps, symbol tables, and dicts into the same camp.
[02:06:50] <robertmaxrees> let me re-frame the concept: if I did const myThing = { foo: () => console.log('bar') }; - what would you call that?
[02:10:57] <pavonia> Object
[02:11:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[02:11:18] <robertmaxrees> and not an associative array.
[02:15:07] <pavonia> But to me there's still no difference to an associative array. You can add new mappings, remove them and have lookups
[02:17:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:17:34] <robertmaxrees> myThing.length is still gonna be undefined.
[02:21:31] <pavonia> Do associative arrays have to support that property natively? One could argue that C arrays are no arrays then as well, because you also have no function that gives you the number of elements directly
[02:22:09] <robertmaxrees> also: array implies that there's a particular order to the properties.  in js, order isn't necessarily guaranteed :)
[02:22:41] <robertmaxrees> *with object properties i mean.
[09:16:27] <nsh> i want to script an action whenever a certain css overlay dialog pops up
[09:16:38] <nsh> (to make some interactions more efficient with a SIEM system)
[09:16:56] <nsh> is there some neat jquery or js that would trigger an action for an overlay with certain text/regex?
[09:17:36] <Cork> regex for overlay??
[09:17:55] <Cork> you're talking about a dom element put ontop of the rest of the content in the page right?
[09:20:49] <nsh> yeah
[09:21:21] <nsh> e.g. http://i.imgur.com/WL5nrwA.png
[09:21:36] <nsh> i'd like to use that class or some selector and set a function to be run when it's visible
[09:21:47] <nsh> dependent on a flag but that can be handled in the function
[09:22:34] <Cork> there are a intersectionObserver you can use to detect visibility
[09:22:38] <Cork> else, no not really
[09:22:43] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API
[09:22:50] <nsh> ty
[09:25:37] <nsh> meh, i'm sure i can find a hackier solution :)
[09:29:57] <nsh> bah none of offset[Parent|Height|Rects] nor getClientRects().length are non-zero/null
[09:30:15] <nsh> the web is cancer. i'm going to get drunk
[09:51:10] <snatcher> $input.prop('valueAsDate').valueOf() / 1000 is there a sugar to get epoch from date?
[09:55:31] <Cork> not natively
[09:55:56] <Cork> have a look at moment.js
[11:57:41] <primitivMedia> https://pastebin.com/H32EJ42e
[11:57:47] <primitivMedia> im getting closer to what i want
[11:58:03] <primitivMedia> the top query doesnt return any results with select 2, it does in the console but the select doesnt display any
[11:58:23] <primitivMedia> when i use the code i was playing with yesetrday, the bottom portion in the paste it returns the results properly

[18:04:32] <EugenA> how can I wrap msg.content with custom css class?
[18:04:47] <EugenA> <span class="my">
[21:00:57] <igcewieling> Am I doing something obviously wrong here?  https://pastebin.com/YFkxaXHS    I'm getting "jquery-3.4.1.min.js:2 Uncaught TypeError: e.indexOf is not a function  at k.fn.init.k.fn.load (jquery-3.4.1.min.js:2)  at update (beta_outefax_gui.php:375)
[21:01:48] <igcewieling> I'm not very good with javascript or jQuery yet.  I must be missing something.
[22:58:39] <snatcher> is there a way to get .text() from $object with elements as array?
[23:09:16] <shoky> snatcher: $object.get().map((elem) => $(elem).text())
