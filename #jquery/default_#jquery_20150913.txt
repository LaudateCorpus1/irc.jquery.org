[00:14:02] <django_> hey
[00:14:04] <django_> anyone here
[00:16:37] <Kamuela> how would you test jquery DOM interaction?
[00:22:06] <Kartagis> Kamuela: on console
[00:22:16] <Kartagis> but that's me
[00:22:22] <Kamuela> I mean like automated testing
[00:22:35] <Kamuela> Would you really have like a mock dom?
[00:38:42] <django_> $ = cheerio.load('<ul id="fruits"><div class="dots">..</div></ul>');
[00:38:53] <django_> console.log($('#fruits').$('.dots').text() )
[00:38:55] <django_> doesnt work
[00:39:01] <django_> how can i access the id and then the class
[00:40:16] <Woet> django_: #frutis .dots
[00:40:19] <Woet> fruits *
[00:44:03] <django_> doesnt work :s
[00:44:18] <django_> using this: https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio
[00:44:27] <Woet> "doesnt work" is useless
[00:44:29] <django_> Woet: example does: $('.apple', '#fruits').text()
[00:44:34] <Woet> that's not what i said.
[00:44:44] <Woet> there are no commas or apostrophes in what I said.
[00:44:48] <django_> i know
[00:44:51] <django_> i tried without commas
[00:45:02] <Woet> okay, so what is the code you tried after my answer?
[00:45:13] <django_> ah crap it worked
[00:45:14] <django_> nm
[00:45:15] <django_> :s
[00:45:28] <Woet> that's why that was my answer.
[00:46:02] <django_> Woet: thanks
[00:46:08] <django_> Woet: can you search via style=" "
[00:46:28] <Woet> django_: yes.
[00:46:44] <django_> Woet: how?
[00:46:51] <Woet> django_: what are you actually trying to do?
[00:46:55] <django_> web scra[
[00:46:56] <django_> scrap
[00:47:10] <Woet> you shouldn't do that.
[00:47:16] <django_> why?
[00:47:28] <Woet> did you get permission?
[00:47:35] <django_> no
[00:47:39] <Woet> then there you go
[00:47:56] <django_> :/
[00:53:47] <robhol> there's nothing wrong about web scraping unless you use the info unethically or spam requests
[00:55:47] <Kamuela> I can't see anything wrong with scraping unless to do it you're being a bit of an asshat to the guy's servers
[00:56:15] <Kamuela> One thing to take some fruit from a guy's front lawn, another to occupy his lawn with 40 dudes while you're doing it
[00:57:04] <robhol> well, to be accurate, the guy would already be offering the fruit, and you'd be copying it. :3
[00:57:42] <Kamuela> thanks for the clarification because I don't think you should be taking someone else's fruit anyway on second thought :P
[01:04:16] <django_> $('span[class="x"]').html();
[01:04:21] <django_> <span class="x"
[01:04:23] <django_> right?
[01:16:06] <whirledpress> huh?
[01:17:31] <Kamuela> who linked the Robert C Martin talk yesterday?
[01:17:34] <django_> $("span.className") that finds the spans with class="className" right?
[01:18:01] <whirledpress> $("span").addClass('x') or $("<span class='x'></span>") to create it. or $("span.x").html() to select it
[01:18:38] <whirledpress> sorry, ignore the .html on the last one, I was copying your previous msg
[01:18:53] <whirledpress> yes
[01:18:59] <Kamuela> whirledpress: where does it place the span in your first example?
[01:19:05] <Kamuela> doesn't it specifically need an append
[01:19:22] <whirledpress> there's lots you can do before appending it
[01:19:38] <Kamuela> are all those behaviors DOM-free?
[01:19:45] <Kamuela> anything that comes before actual writing
[01:20:11] <whirledpress> hmmm, not sure if I understand the question. Yes they are detatched from the dom.
[01:20:29] <Kamuela> so you can precompute a full dom node and only interact with the dom to write it out?
[01:20:52] <whirledpress> In fact, I am working on a wordpress theme that does just that, yes
[01:21:27] <whirledpress> often when using ajax to load a page, you need to massage the contents before appending it to the dom
[01:23:42] <django_> <span class="green">text</span>
[01:24:10] <django_> var test = $('.green').each(function() {
[01:24:10] <django_> 		//this.what? gets me the text
[01:24:10] <django_> 	})
[01:25:12] <whirledpress> because you can have multiple elements of the same class, sometimes you need to loop through each of the elements you selected to do something to them. .each(funciton () {}) applies the function ()  to each .green element
[01:25:54] <whirledpress> to get the text, you'd use .text()
[01:27:51] <whirledpress> another way to think of .each() is when you have multiple items that have something that has to happen to every individual item, but not as a class in general. So you might want to have all your green items change class to yellow...
[01:28:09] <whirledpress> since they all do it, $(".green").prop("class","yellow");
[01:29:10] <whirledpress> but if you want each one to change it's text to identify it's number, for example $(".green").each(function (i) {$(this).text( "green #"+i);});
[01:30:06] <Kamuela> good point whirledpress
[01:31:54] <abcde123> Hi! I'd like to "freeze" an element, that's only available when I hover over an image, setting :hover in the inspector or using $(elementname).trigger('hover') (or mouseover/mouseenter) doesn't work. the usecase is any instagram account, like this one: https://instagram.com/thisoldshirt/ when you hover over an image, you get the likes & comment count
[01:32:49] <toothe> okay, now I'm really realy realy furstrated
[01:32:55] <toothe> been on this for 2-3 hours
[01:33:12] <toothe> i selected an <OPTION> tag and wanted to insert another <OPTION> tag immedaitely after it
[01:33:15] <django_> <p class="a"><span style="display: block:"> <span class="content">text</span> </span></p>
[01:33:20] <django_> i wanna access text
[01:33:32] <django_> id like to use that style
[01:34:11] <toothe> whenever I do $("#mySelect OPTION")[3].after('<OPTION>TESTING</OPTION'); it inserts INTO the text value of that 3rd item
[01:34:16] <toothe> it inserts as the text
[01:34:18] <toothe> not in the right place.
[01:34:24] <toothe> I said inset AFTER the tag, not INTO the ta.
[01:34:25] <toothe> tag*
[01:34:31] <toothe> how the hell do I do this?
[01:34:33] <abcde123> django_: $('.content').text() ?
[01:35:02] <toothe> why is my .after() insertion inserting INTO the element?
[01:35:23] <toothe> if I select an <OPTION>, how do I add another <OPTION> afterwards?
[01:35:27] <whirledpress> toothe, $("#mySelect option")[3] gets the html element not the jquery object
[01:35:39] <toothe> okay okay...
[01:35:57] <toothe> whirledpress: gah! I'm really frustrated then.
[01:36:01] <toothe> How do I insert after the 3rd item?
[01:36:03] <whirledpress> $("#mySelect option").eq(3)
[01:36:12] <whirledpress> selects the third option.
[01:36:54] <whirledpress> $("<option value='4'>TRY THIS</option>").insertAfter($("#myselect option").eq(2));
[01:38:00] <toothe> whirledpress: i think that works...
[01:38:07] <toothe> wow....
[01:38:12] <toothe> i've been on this for 2-3 hours.
[01:38:28] <whirledpress> just remember that [3] selects the HTML element...not the jquery object. The jquery object has all the magic
[01:39:13] <whirledpress> to select the 3rd element in any collection of jquery objects $("collection").eq(3) should do it
[01:39:22] <whirledpress> sorry, eq(2)
[01:39:31] <whirledpress> I always forget it's offset from 0
[01:50:20] <django_> using cheerio, i have this: request({ uri: }) i wanna be able to make a function that takes in a link
[01:50:49] <whirledpress> huh?
[02:26:39] <Gaussian_blur> Hello I'm new here. I know basic level Jquery . Can anybody tell me how can i improve myself !  Thanks in advance !
[02:28:01] <Kartagis> Gaussian_blur: you can do so in http://try.jquery.com. I know it helped me a lot. in addition you can experiment on jsfiddle.net or codepen.io
[02:33:41] <Kartagis> anyone?
[02:34:08] <Gaussian_blur> Kartagis: thanks !
[02:34:32] <Kartagis> np,
[02:34:48] * Kartagis unblurs Gaussian_blur
[02:35:06] <Kartagis> or...
[02:35:27] <Gaussian_blur> nice !
[02:37:09] <Kartagis> okay I give up, my IRC client doesn't let me do funky
[02:37:34] <Gaussian_blur> Kartagis : pm?
[02:37:44] <Kartagis> why not here?
[02:38:16] <Gaussian_blur> i'm a newbie ! wanna ask you few things :)
[02:38:32] <Uhkis> just ask here
[02:38:47] <Uhkis> way more experience here than in any pm
[02:38:56] <Kartagis> agreed
[02:39:10] <Kartagis> we all were newbies once
[02:39:41] <Kartagis> but if everyone helped everyone in pm, noone would have learned anything
[02:39:56] <Uhkis> exactly
[02:40:43] <Gaussian_blur> actually i wanna do open source programming , from  where should i start ?
[02:41:08] <Kartagis> Uhkis: can you help me about  why $.mobile.changePage is not working at all in http://termbin.com/b996 ?
[02:41:16] <Kartagis> Gaussian_blur: pick a language
[02:41:27] <Kartagis> anything but C#
[02:41:47] <Gaussian_blur> i know java javascript
[02:41:58] <Gaussian_blur> learning libraries in javascript
[02:42:19] <Uhkis> Gaussian_blur: learn git and start a project on github
[02:42:22] <Kartagis> you wanna do front-end?
[02:42:40] <Kartagis> Uhkis++
[02:43:11] <Gaussian_blur> yeah i did something ! basic html css javscript
[02:43:16] <Gaussian_blur> sure i wanna try more
[02:43:21] <Kartagis> Gaussian_blur: best way to learn stuff is use them in a project
[02:43:33] <Kartagis> maybe get freelancing work
[02:44:07] <Kartagis> that pressures you time-wise, and you don't get lazyass
[02:44:24] <Uhkis> Kartagis: sorry, i dont know jqm. start by checking for js errors
[02:44:48] <Kartagis> Uhkis: no errors, nothing
[02:45:08] <Kartagis> nothing in dev tools network tab
[02:45:41] <Gaussian_blur> how to get suitable  projects ? git ?
[02:49:09] <Kartagis> git is a version control system dude
[02:49:25] <Kartagis> has little to do with projects
[02:50:41] <Kartagis> [12:49:41] *alis* #jquerymobile                                        2 :Channel closed - support moved to #jquery <--- heh
[02:52:05] <Uhkis> git has everything to do with projects ;)
[02:54:29] <Gaussian_blur> Utkis: can u elaborate ?
[02:55:25] <Uhkis> almost every project uses git nowadays
[02:56:46] <Kartagis> Uhkis: agreed, but s/he said suitable projects
[02:57:15] <Gaussian_blur> Uhkis : but as a newbie do u think working on big projects would help?
[02:57:19] <Woet> git > *
[02:57:35] <Gaussian_blur> Kartagis +1
[02:57:37] <Kartagis> Uhkis: plus, you don't use git /in/ a project, you use it to /control/ it
[03:00:15] <whirledpress> did I stumble into #semantics by accident?
[03:04:12] <whirledpress> Kartagis, why are you using ajax inside of ajax? not saying its wrong, just wondering?
[03:04:51] <Kartagis> whirledpress: I have to, otherwise I get CSRF validation failure
[03:05:58] <whirledpress> I believe you, just don't get it. You have type=post but no data in the outer ajax, how can that ever succeed?
[03:06:47] <whirledpress> oh, I see it
[03:06:54] <Uhkis> Gaussian_blur: not necessarily big but well made (like has tests and clean code etc)
[03:07:12] <whirledpress> you get a session token in the first ajax call that you use to authenticate. I see it now.
[03:08:41] <Uhkis> whirledpress: are you a wordpresser?
[03:08:54] <whirledpress> I wouldn't go that far...lol
[03:09:49] <Uhkis> as in wp user/dev :)
[03:09:56] <Kartagis> you wouldn't go that far about wordpress, or using nested ajax calls?
[03:10:25] <whirledpress> I wouldn't pledge allegiance to WordPress. lol I do wordpress, but mostly it does me.
[03:11:26] <whirledpress> I struggle with wordpress and it's logical inconsistencies and arbitrary weirdness.  In fact, the irony is that I am working on a theme that uses ajax to wordpress.
[03:12:55] <Uhkis> well wp's code is a horrible mess :-D
[03:14:06] <whirledpress> but somehow honorable, I suppose. Their dedication to backwards compatiblity is what makes it a mess, but also what keeps 1/3 of the web running.
[03:15:11] <Uhkis> so thats the reason for all that spaghetti
[03:15:33] <Kartagis> Uhkis: idk if that is still the case, but you had to edit functions.php just to get another content type like drupal does beautifully
[03:16:34] <whirledpress> well keep in mind that WordPress is a blog at heart.
[03:17:49] <whirledpress> It just treads all over standard paradigms and makes everything confusing. Things like "header" have more than a dozen different contexts. Or gawd forbid you say "page"--it means so many conflicting things that it's impossible to discusss
[03:18:44] <Kartagis> a wise man once said "use wordpress to create a blog, use Drupal to create wordpress"
[03:19:05] <Uhkis> [13:18] < Druplicon> If you like Drupal, raise your hand. If you like Wordpress, raise your standards.
[03:19:10] <Uhkis> gotta love that joke :D
[03:19:11] <whirledpress> I have never heard anyone say to use Drupal.
[03:19:16] <whirledpress> Love that joke
[03:19:38] <whirledpress> It's nice to hear someone stand up for droops.
[03:20:02] * Kartagis raises hand
[03:20:15] * Kartagis is a Drupal guy
[03:21:00] <Uhkis> btw Kartagis are you doing headless on d7?
[03:22:00] * Kartagis is sad to say he doesn't know what "headless" even means
[03:22:39] <whirledpress> All the tender vittles of (insert cms here) without the admin overhead
[03:22:56] <Uhkis> as in drupal is just the backend
[03:24:14] <Kartagis> as a framework
[03:24:27] <Kartagis> mostly your own code?
[03:24:29] <Kartagis> no
[04:29:54] <richurdjs> hi, i have an ajax function with select on change, i can get the response from the ajax part, i also want to update the div on update, now it is not a unique class, it has lot of elements with same class, i tried $(this) in success, but its not working?
[04:39:55] <guessx> richurdjs: got a jsfiddle?
[05:03:02] <juro> hi everyone!
[05:04:44] <juro> I am building an import preview function. I am building a (possibly long, > 500) list of ul>li elements with custom data attributes. When I click "preview", I want to send a request to the server for every line and act on the feedback I get. http://jsfiddle.net/juro/gj1sh4za/7/
[05:06:05] <juro> Of course, doing this for that many elements will be very taxing on the browser, so I would like to break it up in blocks of around 5-10 at a time. As soon as one is done, the next one in the list starts - any idea how I can achieve this?
[05:08:55] <Kartagis> anyone can help?
[05:09:47] <Kartagis> can you help me about why $.mobile.changePage is not working at all in http://termbin.com/b996 ?
[05:12:26] <juro> Kartagis, create a jsfiddle
[05:13:39] <npranav> Hello!
[05:13:47] <juro> hi]
[05:14:35] <npranav> I am getting the following error while trying to create jquery based mobile UI
[05:14:38] <npranav> Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to execute 'pushState' on 'History': A history state object with URL 'file:///C:/www/index.html#page2' cannot be created in a document with origin 'null'.
[05:14:48] <npranav> any ideas :)
[05:15:38] <npranav> this happens while trying to use  activate_page("#page2"); function
[05:16:40] <juro> npranav, seeing that we cannot possibly know anything about your application, you will need to create a jsfiddle ...
[05:18:59] <npranav> juro:its very big code in intel xda which includes cordova.js and many images
[05:19:03] <npranav> hard to paste
[05:19:21] <Gaussian_blur>  /msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER Gaussian_blur pslwftiqrvxq
[05:19:39] <juro> npranav, then for your own sake, isolate the issue - then you can create a jsfiddle
[05:19:50] <juro> And now we can all log in as Gaussian_blur  ....
[05:20:05] <Kartagis> wut? it works on jsfiddle juro
[05:20:24] <Gaussian_blur> oops
[05:20:55] <Kartagis> Gaussian_blur: there was a time when I typed my password in the channel
[05:21:01] <Kartagis> has been*
[05:21:48] <Gaussian_blur> Kartagis lol !
[05:22:14] <Gaussian_blur> a single space :/
[05:22:58] <juro> Kartagis, see, now all you need to do is find out the difference between jsfiddle and your application - maybe you are loading an older jquery version? or there is some confilicting code ...
[05:23:40] <Kartagis> juro: the thing is, it works everywhere else
[05:24:01] <juro> Kartagis, where doesn't it work?
[05:24:43] <Kartagis> juro: in my logout() function, on mobile
[05:24:57] <Kartagis> I've got the exact same code
[05:25:50] <juro> Kartagis, is this just a HTML/jQuery website that you are accessing via a mobile device
[05:25:51] <juro> ?
[05:26:28] <Kartagis> juro: no, a PHP website I'm using phonegap to access
[05:27:32] <juro> so, on the devices where it works, are you using phonegap?
[05:28:56] <Kartagis> yes
[05:29:14] <Kartagis> it's all in the same app
[05:29:29] <Kartagis> the thing that works and doesn't work
[05:30:13] <juro> well, there obviously is a difference, so if you find that you'll probably have an answer
[05:30:32] <Kartagis> I'm also comparing syntax, and it's the same
[05:31:41] <Kartagis> juro: when  I change index.html to ../index.html, it complains
[05:35:21] <Kartagis> that means it actually works
[05:35:37] <Kartagis> but not with index.html
[05:38:19] <juro> anyone have an idea how to solve my use case?
[05:40:14] <Kartagis> juro: yeah, it doesn't work with index.html
[05:40:48] <juro> so it seems your reference is incorrect?
[05:41:12] <Kartagis> index.html exists
[05:41:59] <juro> yes, but it seems you "are in" some sub directory, so that you need to append the "../" in order to reference the index.html ...
[05:42:12] <Kartagis> juro: for your question, I think you can use .done()
[05:42:17] <Kartagis> juro: when  I change index.html to ../index.html, it complains
[05:42:49] <juro> yes, as there is no index.html in the parent directory?
[05:43:11] <Kartagis> wait, what? this could be it!
[05:43:25] <juro> Kartagis, yeah, I know that - I just don't know how to create and manipulate the queue ....
[05:43:30] <Kartagis> brb, testing
[05:44:42] <Kartagis> juro: index.html is in the parent directory
[05:44:56] <Kartagis> so ../index.html should work
[05:47:37] <juro> well, that depends on in what context you are referencing "index.html"
[05:52:48] <Kartagis> hrm
[05:52:56] <Kartagis> interesting
[05:53:16] <Kartagis> phonegap refers to it as /android_asset
[05:55:32] <Kartagis> or it is referred to as
[05:59:30] <Kartagis> I log the current directory, and it shows the directory index.html is in
[06:35:42] <juro> how can I get an array of all attributes of one element?
[06:36:09] <juro> (preferably filtered, e.g. "data-*")
[06:37:46] <PlanC> I have some ad-tags that are not async
[06:38:12] <PlanC> I've added them inside my own async scripts which will then load them from there
[06:38:31] <PlanC> <script src="loader.js"></script>
[06:39:03] <PlanC> I've added a <div id="ad"></div> and loader.js will locate "#ad" and put the tags inside there
[06:39:28] <PlanC> but, now the problem is that the ads aren't being loaded with .append() nor are they being loaded with .html()
[06:39:59] <PlanC> when I put the tags inside document.write() [with async disabled], it works perfectly fine
[06:40:39] <PlanC> anyone have a clue on why they aren't being loaded with .append()/.html() but are working perfectly fine with document.write()
[06:42:42] <juro> PlanC, create a jsfiddle isolating your problem.
[06:44:54] <PlanC> juro: I might just have found the problem
[06:44:59] <PlanC> going to give it a try and come back with more info
[06:44:59] <juro> good
[06:45:11] <PlanC> I think it could be the <script></script> tags that are causing problems
[06:45:23] <PlanC> going to change it to <scr"+"ipt></scr"+"ipt>
[06:47:36] <pickandmix> Hi All, I would like some advice on which book to read up on regarding jQuery
[06:49:46] <PlanC> pickandmix: what would you like to learn?
[06:50:04] <pickandmix> I have some jquery source code that I need to learn how to understand/use
[06:50:13] <PlanC> what does it do?
[06:50:32] <pickandmix> It's something like a jigsaw puzzle jquery code
[06:50:49] <PlanC> nothing beats the jquery docs (which is what the authors use themselves)
[06:51:11] <PlanC> so if you want to go really deep into the language and fully understand it then get a book, but otherwise you can just look each function up on the docs
[06:51:16] <pickandmix> I understand I can kinda use jquery without really learnining it. But I need to implement more features and do some editing. So I really have to understand the code.
[06:51:50] <pickandmix> I'm actually trying to understand the code line by line.
[06:52:19] <whirledpress> That's like starting at the front of a finnish dictionary and trying to learn the language.
[06:53:03] <pickandmix> Yeah. I know. So I'm actually here to get some direction on how to work on it yeah?
[06:53:26] <whirledpress> Learn Javascript first. How's your js?
[06:53:31] <pickandmix> my js is alright.
[06:53:45] <whirledpress> Well Jquery is just js
[06:53:49] <pickandmix> I'm just not cool with all the $.(selector) shit
[06:54:09] <whirledpress> $ is just the shortcut for the JQuery class
[06:54:21] <whirledpress> you can say JQuery(something) if you want
[06:54:25] <pickandmix> Yeah I understand that.
[06:54:37] <whirledpress> you know CSS?
[06:54:47] <pickandmix> Yes, I know both html and CSS.
[06:55:10] <whirledpress> Then jquery is EASY for you. $(.cssclassname) selects the elements in that class
[06:55:17] <whirledpress> #id works too
[06:55:27] <pickandmix> I do understand all these kind of.
[06:55:28] <whirledpress> in fact, most of the css selectors work
[06:55:38] <pickandmix> It's when like new "terms" coming in
[06:55:39] <pickandmix> For example.
[06:55:53] <whirledpress> ...
[06:55:58] <whirledpress> what terms?
[06:56:03] <pickandmix> http://codepad.org/krUimq4L
[06:56:09] <pickandmix> As in like this is the first 3 line of the code.
[06:56:30] <pickandmix> I have no idea how to interpret that, I need to learn how to understand that.
[06:56:43] <whirledpress> The first line is (I always get this wrong) an immediately executing anonymous function
[06:57:09] <whirledpress> or something like that. It means that anything inside the () can't be evaluated until the dom is completely loaded
[06:57:27] <whirledpress> (funtion ($) {     is a lot like $(document).ready(function () {
[06:57:45] <pickandmix> I assuming it's something like a opener for a jquery code.
[06:58:07] <whirledpress> it makes sure that all your elements are in the dom before you try to select themn
[06:58:53] <whirledpress> $ is the jquery class and they defined $.fn to be the prototype of the jquery class so you can easily extend jquery's prototype by $.fn.somefunc
[06:59:21] <whirledpress> Just like prototype, that means $(something).somefunc() should now work
[06:59:55] <pickandmix> http://codepad.org/09T1tgZW
[07:00:22] <pickandmix> This is the whole file. I can read it somehow, but I don't have the capabilities to edit around it.
[07:00:31] <pickandmix> Or even how to use this code.
[07:01:15] <whirledpress> since this is a plugin, you should ask it's author for help. He/she implemented the code so you could use this syntax:
[07:01:28] <whirledpress> $(something).snapPuzzle(somevalues);
[07:01:37] <pickandmix> He do have some documentation, a demo for it.
[07:01:39] <pickandmix> And that
[07:01:54] <pickandmix> and that's how I work on it, I managed to implement all the things by kinda playing around with his code.
[07:02:21] <whirledpress> Picking apart plugins is going to be tricky.
[07:02:22] <pickandmix> But right now, I need to go beyond his work and implement further features you see.
[07:02:48] <pickandmix> But I'm pretty sure it's still easier as compared to coding a whole jigsaw plugin out solely.
[07:03:09] <whirledpress> It's almost always best in here to tell people what you are tyring to accomplish---your end goal and let them help you get there. That gives you opportunity to learn as you go
[07:03:22] <Kartagis> whirledpress: would you happen to have an idea why $.mobile.changePage("index.html","slide") doesn't work at all but it does with any other .html file in the same directory as index.html?
[07:04:08] <pickandmix> I would love to do that. But I'm not really sure how to.
[07:04:18] <whirledpress> Kartagis, I am not that up on jqmobile, but $.mobile.changePage() seems like weird nomenclature to me
[07:04:53] <whirledpress> if you don't know what you want, how can we help.
[07:05:14] <pickandmix> As in like, I'm not sure how I would explain it here.
[07:05:16] <Kartagis> whirledpress: besides, $.mobile.changePage() works on any other page
[07:05:17] <pickandmix> It's kind of a project.
[07:05:56] <whirledpress> is it possible that your site is redirecting index.html the way wordpress redirects everything?
[07:06:21] <pickandmix> whirledpress, I have no idea on this, but would coding out a jigsaw plugin be a better choice here?
[07:07:29] <whirledpress> pickandmix, let me consult my crystal ball....you have a sort of project that you don't know what you want to do with or how to do it, but you wan tto know if coding a jigsaw plugin here is the way to start...
[07:09:06] <whirledpress> Kartagis, i'll lookup the changePage method and see what I can find
[07:10:13] <whirledpress> Kartagis, I think that "slide" has to be an object
[07:10:35] <whirledpress> {transition:"slide"} maybe?
[07:10:40] <whirledpress> still reading
[07:11:08] <pickandmix> whirldpress: could you guide me on a good book yeah?
[07:11:21] <Kartagis> whirledpress: I use it with the same syntax everywhere
[07:12:54] <whirledpress> Kartagis, did you try $.mobile.changePage("./index.html");
[07:13:09] <Kartagis> tbh, no
[07:13:14] <Kartagis> let me try
[07:21:28] <Kartagis> whirledpress: tried, no dice
[07:25:30] <Kartagis> fun fact: I do console.log("login.js is "+window.location.pathname) in login.js and it prints login.html
[07:25:46] <Kartagis> login.js is src'd from login.html
[07:27:10] <whirledpress> wait...huh?
[07:27:28] <whirledpress> console.log(window.location.pathname) returns what?
[07:27:43] <Kartagis> login.html
[07:28:22] <whirledpress> can you look at index.html and determine what is in it. It probably has a redirect to login.html if the person's not logged in
[07:28:31] <whirledpress> so changepage wont work
[07:30:00] <Kartagis> <a class="grayBtn" href="login.html" data-transition="slide" data-role="button" id="loginBtn">Giriş yap</a>
[07:30:15] <Kartagis> I only have this
[07:31:55] <whirledpress> what do you mean you only have this? that's the only content in index.html
[07:32:59] <Kartagis> no no
[07:33:17] <Kartagis> the only line referencing t login.html
[07:33:22] <Kartagis> to*
[07:33:44] <whirledpress> where is that line?
[07:34:23] <Kartagis> in index.html
[07:34:40] <Kartagis> want me to pastebin it?
[07:34:45] <whirledpress> yes please
[07:35:35] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/teo1
[07:35:48] <Kartagis> both index.html and login.html
[07:37:50] <whirledpress> okay, got those so what's the issue?
[07:42:48] <Kartagis> let me pastebin login.js as well
[07:44:28] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/hzls when I click on Giriş yap, it should redirect to index.html
[07:44:35] <Kartagis> 'cept it doesn't
[07:44:45] <Kartagis> but any other page works
[07:45:21] <Kartagis> I mean $.mobile.changePage("inst.html","slide") works
[07:45:33] <Kartagis> but not index.html
[07:48:37] <whirledpress> and you aren't getting anmy errors?
[07:48:41] <Kartagis> nope
[07:49:18] <Kartagis> maybe this is the reasons changePage is deprecated?
[07:49:24] <Kartagis> reason*
[07:49:34] <whirledpress> do this. Create a new html page called TEST.html and place it in the same directory as index.html
[07:50:34] <whirledpress> change the $.mobile.changePage("test.html", "slide");   in the success handler and tell me if it loads the blank page
[07:54:36] <Kartagis> yes I get the blank page
[07:55:13] <Kartagis> why doesn't it change to index.html?
[07:55:37] <Kartagis> oh, I have got an idea
[08:04:56] <Kartagis> yay!
[08:07:31] <Kartagis> {reloadPage:true},{allowSamePageTranstion:true},{transition:'slide'} worked
[08:09:36] <voltair3> angular ng-repeat simple question, please help: http://pastebin.com/dVTiQZcV
[08:20:31] <adv_> anyone has a fiddle of masonry with photoswipe?
[08:22:17] <whirledpress> dude, did you goole those same words?

[08:33:42] <Kamuela> voltair3: try #angularjs
[08:38:10] <adv_> i want to get "data-size" attr from each "a" and then apply it to every "a" at a later time, how can i do this?
[08:53:51] <Uhkis> you need each(), data() and attr()
[09:03:21] <adv_> i have var thumbnail = items[index].el.children[0];
[09:03:33] <adv_> which i console.log-ged and it is an object
[09:03:52] <adv_> now i want to hardcode this as thumbnail = items[index].thumb;
[09:04:42] <adv_> and i have var items = [{ thumb: 'foo' } , { thumb: 'bar'} ]  , but it doesn't work
[09:04:55] <adv_> any ideas
[09:06:30] <adv_> ah so one is [object HTMLImageElement] and the other is a string
[09:07:29] <adv_> i need to pass [object HTMLImageElement] , how can i get that from a string?
[09:35:50] <Gaussian_blur>  
[10:29:48] <adv_> i want to shuffle two arrays that have the same number of elements with the same order
[10:30:00] <adv_> how can i do that?
[10:48:26] <hapi> adv_: http://jsfiddle.net/vvpoma8w/
[11:12:06] <adv_> can i have custom js on a @media directive?
[11:14:21] <Kamuela> what's a good way to contain easily deployable "widgets"
[11:31:54] <hapi> adv_, there is no vanilla solution to do that, but you can use thirdparty libraries like respond.js
[11:59:29] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/arodht2g/ <--- why am I getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined here?
[12:07:14] <hapi> Kartagis, you have to iterate over the kime.nodes first, then the node: http://jsfiddle.net/arodht2g/1/
[12:16:30] <Kartagis> how do I say if this field contains this?
[12:16:37] <Kartagis> in jquery
[12:19:12] <Kartagis> heh
[12:19:15] <Kartagis> got it
[12:19:20] <Kartagis> indexOf
[12:20:46] <hapi> :)
[12:56:20] <Kartagis> I give up. isn't (field_kime.indexOf('764') != 0) correct when field_kime contains 764?
[12:57:21] <SmashingX> I’m trying to validate all the elements in a form http://jsfiddle.net/vqr22ebz/
[12:57:30] <SmashingX> but apparently it’s not working the way I’m doing it
[12:57:32] <SmashingX> any help?
[13:03:32] <hapi> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/arodht2g/3/ try this way
[13:04:38] <hapi> SmashingX, what is the formItems? i cannot se where you defined in the fiddle
[13:06:59] <SmashingX> http://jsfiddle.net/vqr22ebz/1/
[13:07:04] <SmashingX> you are right hapi
[13:09:45] <SmashingX> http://jsfiddle.net/vqr22ebz/3/
[13:09:51] <SmashingX> this is an updated version now
[13:10:11] <hapi> SmashingX: http://jsfiddle.net/vqr22ebz/4/
[13:10:18] <hapi> an alternative solution:)
[13:10:37] <hapi> (the alert is disabled on jsfiddle)
[13:10:46] <Kartagis> hrm
[13:11:04] <Kartagis> hapi: sorry but that doesn't work
[13:12:10] <hapi> maybe i dont understand your problem. if the node field_kime value is contain 764, you want to do something with that?
[13:12:12] <SmashingX> I see hapi thanks
[13:12:22] <SmashingX> but I have to show the alert to the user
[13:12:56] <hapi> on your site you can, so only you have to replace the the border css with your alert
[13:13:03] <hapi> *border css line
[13:18:32] <Kartagis> hapi: I was wrong, it works
[13:18:46] <Kartagis> I want to find how many
[13:25:56] <hapi> thats simple. just create a counter, which is increases in your statement http://jsfiddle.net/arodht2g/4/
[13:28:24] <Kartagis> hapi: you see that field_kime contains 1
[13:28:33] <Kartagis> on line 30
[13:28:57] <Kartagis> when I edit the code for 1, I don't get anything
[13:31:00] <hapi> you're right, i cannot see you have multiple values
[13:31:13] <SmashingX> hapi, it’s weird but in jsfiddle it works but not in my project
[13:31:38] <SmashingX> in my project when Im debugging it doesn’t even get inside of that $.each($('.validate'), function (i, v) {
[13:31:52] <SmashingX> where are you getting that ,validate from?
[13:32:29] <hapi> Kartagis, you have to split the values which will become another array, so you have to loop over them too
[13:33:13] <hapi> SmashingX, i put the classes on the selectors which has to be validated
[13:33:27] <hapi> i think you forget to apply:)
[13:33:42] <SmashingX> oh fk
[13:33:42] <SmashingX> thanks why
[13:34:55] <SmashingX> Is it posssible to do it without classes?
[13:35:12] <hapi> yes
[13:35:36] <hapi> you can target the selectors by attributes too
[13:36:14] <hapi> eg: instead of .validate you can check $('input[type="text"], input[type="password"]')
[13:36:48] <hapi> but this method has some cons
[13:39:29] <Kartagis> if (e.field_kime.indexOf('764') > 0) { why isn't this correct?
[13:41:16] <hapi> Kartagis: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf
[13:41:33] <hapi> scroll down to the description, where clearly explained why:)
[13:45:52] <Kartagis> hapi: how can I pull this off?
[13:47:34] <Kartagis> heh, .includes()
[13:57:06] <rindolf> Hi all.
[13:58:41] <hapi> hey
[14:19:53] <rindolf> hapi: sup?
[14:52:02] <Jam33s> I'm doing a wrapAll('<li><a href="#">blah blah</a><ul></ul></li>') to wrap 2 selected elements within the <ul> but they get wrapped under the <a> instead. How can I wrap my elements in the <ul> ?
[14:55:13] <rindolf> Jam33s: can  you call wrapAll twice?
[14:55:30] <Jam33s>  rindolf: can I?
[14:55:31] <rindolf> Jam33s: possibly with some other calls?
[14:55:43] <rindolf> Jam33s: I think you can.
[14:55:46] <Jam33s>  rindolf: can you give me an example?
[14:56:39] <rindolf> Jam33s: well pseudocode is $(....).wrapAll('<ul></ul>').before('<a ... ></a>').wrapAll('<li>...</li>')
[15:01:04] <Jam33s> rindolf: that doesn't work
[15:01:09] <Jam33s> it messes up the HTML

[16:56:10] <Giraffe_> percent
[17:30:54] <BillCriswell> Dammit. overscroll bouncing is a jerk.
