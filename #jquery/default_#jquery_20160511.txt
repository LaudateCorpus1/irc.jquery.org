[00:19:31] <_August_> So... Question, im trying to call the validation function from this file because it has rules and it is being used on several of my forms, but I have one form that is being loaded dynamically and therefore the validation function cant find it upon the script loading up. So I am wondering if there is an alternative maybe reloading the script or is this this best method? http://pastebin.com/px2BsHnN
[00:21:58] <IamTrying> http://paste.ubuntu.com/16355609/ - "401 Unauthorized" always. How do you send USERNAME/PASSWORD while using $.ajax or $.get or $.post for Tomcat server where it ask with popup username/password?
[02:29:51] <hellyeah> yo
[03:02:31] <baako> hi guys https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/1/ i want to show the contains wrapped in <div id="NewCardContainer"> after the accordion stuff what i have tried doesnt seem to show it when you click on the "load" button. This image shows what i am mean where it says "pay with debt or credit card" https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByGgvwO76KWTYXFLNXR3Tkw3bGs
[03:13:32] <jerit> when I click a button on my site, I need to iterate through rows on my table looking for one that has class "is__selected" but I'm not sure how to do this
[03:32:12] <konrados> jerit, something like this: $('#your_button_id').click(function(){ var selectedRow = $('#table_id').find('.is_selected'); });
[03:33:49] <Cork> or just $('table tr.is_selected')
[03:34:47] <jerit> Cork how do you think this will work if I have multiple rows selected and the user then for some reasons decides to attempt to edit them all at the same time?
[03:35:12] <Cork> jerit: classic problem
[03:35:15] <jerit> wait, won't $('table tr.is_selected') simply return the first element that matches the selector?
[03:35:22] <Cork> no it returns all
[03:35:41] <Cork> you could grab the first match, or you could forbid edit if more then one row is selected
[03:35:54] <jerit> so now the question becomes how to determine whether or not multiple rows are selected
[03:36:11] <Cork> $('table tr.is_selected').length > 1
[03:36:58] <TedMed> Hi
[03:36:59] <TedMed> jQuery.getScript( "./loadme.js" ); -> www.domain1.com/loadme.js instead of www.scriptdomain.com/folder/loadme.js
[03:37:00] <jerit> that simple? damn
[03:37:30] <TedMed> how do i make sure the relative path is the relative path of the script and not the domain calling the script
[03:37:35] <mrs> hi i have a problem with isotope
[03:37:38] <jerit> TedMed tried .getScript()ing the FQDN?
[03:38:00] <TedMed> That works but i don't want to hardcode it
[03:38:08] <mrs> look at http://www.chandnafar.com
[03:38:13] <Cork> TedMed: you can't
[03:38:13] <mrs> is there any one
[03:38:17] <TedMed> makes my life easier when moving away from the development server
[03:38:29] <Cork> TedMed: relative paths area always relative to the page not the script
[03:38:40] <TedMed> ok, so there is not way to determine the url of the script being called?
[03:38:47] <Cork> no
[03:38:55] <Cork> also calling that server will be considered cross domain
[03:39:02] <Cork> just so you know
[03:39:05] <TedMed> im all about cross domain
[03:40:19] <TedMed> what im trying to achieve is a wordpress plugin which consists of as little code as possible, also i want to be able to change everything on the server side, not in the plugin code
[03:40:38] <TedMed> i allready manged to get sessions working over CORS
[03:41:00] <TedMed> now i want to move all of the assets to my server
[03:41:31] <TedMed> but i don't want to define multiple scripts to be loaded in the plugin code, but one, which would then call the rest of the files
[03:41:50] <TedMed> so that if i need to make changes to what scripts i use, i could just edit one file, without updating all the plugins installed
[03:42:29] <TedMed> maybe im doing everything a bit backwards but i need to build a plugin for 5 different CMS
[03:42:40] <TedMed> so thats why i want to keep plugin code to a minimum
[03:43:24] <mrs> hi i have a question
[03:43:26] <TedMed> and i will have a list of domains which are allowed to use the plugin, so CORS headers are easy to maintain
[03:44:06] <mrs> my isotope not sorting masonry
[03:46:09] <mrs> helooooo
[03:46:40] <mrs> i have a question with isotope insert
[03:50:57] <jerit> $("table") or $('table') ... there are 2 types of people...
[03:51:13] <jerit> mrs ask your question.
[03:51:34] <baako> Cork, can you help me please https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/1/ i want the "pay with debt or credit card" option to show up like this https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByGgvwO76KWTYXFLNXR3Tkw3bGs in the jsfiddle it doesnt come up
[03:52:50] <Cork> baako: not sure what your asking about, the css isn't included for one
[03:53:03] <baako> Cork, not the css but the jquery
[03:53:15] <baako> i am not refering to the styling
[03:53:26] <Cork> then what are you talking about?
[03:54:08] <baako> if you click on the load button
[03:54:23] <baako> you dont see the "Pay with debit or credit card"
[03:54:48] <baako> basically when JQUERY UI accordion kicks in, it removes it
[03:56:31] <mrs> please look at chandnafar.com
[03:56:42] <mrs> isotope not working in relayout my site
[03:57:05] <ledj2015> Is it possible to have nested sortables using jquery ui ?
[03:57:53] <Cork> ledj2015: yes
[03:58:46] <ledj2015> Cork: great! do you know how performance is when using a lot of images ?
[03:59:24] <Cork> ledj2015: haven't used it for a while but as far as i remember it worked well
[03:59:42] <Cork> depends on your definition of "lots" though
[04:01:21] <Cork> baako: the problem is with your html https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/4/
[04:01:29] <Cork> the accordion is wrapping everything
[04:01:38] <Cork> so when you replace the content you remove everything
[04:03:09] <ledj2015> Cork: ok, I guess it will be around 20 images each in 10 nested sortables (galleries) 200 images in total
[04:03:42] <Cork> i think i've used like 150 without having any problem so ya that should work fine
[04:04:01] <ledj2015> Cork: ok thanks!
[04:04:50] <baako> Cork, thanks. How you suggest going about with this please
[04:05:14] <Cork> baako: well you could replace part of the accordion content instead of all of it
[04:05:25] <Cork> or you could move the part you don't want to replace out of it
[04:06:17] <baako> Cork, if i move the part i dont want out of it then it doesnt get that jquery ui accordion style if you get what i mean
[04:06:40] <Cork> baako: ok then you have to target the accortion part you want to replace
[04:06:45] <Cork> instead of replacing all of it
[04:07:37] <baako> Cork, how will you do it? what is the logic you will use please
[04:11:29] <Cork> well you would have to select the elements you want to replace
[04:11:41] <Cork> and ex. insert the new html before it and then remove the old
[04:13:16] <baako> Cork, in this case the element to select might be the template id
[04:13:33] <Cork> if you do you can never reuse the template
[04:13:39] <Cork> cause it will be gone
[04:13:47] <Cork> (well unless you reload)
[04:14:15] <baako> the template element is response for this {{type}} {{cardno}} exp{{exp_month}} / {{exp_year}}
[04:14:59] <baako> at times like this i wish i had a bit or knowledge of jquery seem am having to spend more time doing it seen the front end guy isnt here anymore
[04:20:26] <baako> Cork, after selecting the element
[04:20:37] <baako> i will choose to seleect the template id
[04:21:07] <Cork> baako: i would recommend moving the template out of the accoridon and make it into a <script type="text/template"> element
[04:21:16] <baako> what i dont understand Cork is that the  <div id="template"> is not wrapped with within   <div id="NewCardContainer">
[04:21:17] <Cork> no point in making it visible in the page
[04:21:45] <Cork> baako: the problem isn't with template, it is with id="accordion"
[04:22:02] <Cork> so when you replace the content of #accordion you replace everything
[04:22:36] <baako> i guess this is where that happens accordion.html(simplate2(data, template)) .accordion({ icons: icons });
[04:22:55] <baako> isnt they a walk around?
[04:25:24] <baako> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/5/
[04:25:59] <Xatenev> morning
[04:26:12] <Xatenev> inside a .closest() how do I do a wildcard?
[04:26:32] <Xatenev> just like in standard jquery selector?
[04:26:36] <Cork> ya
[04:26:49] <baako> ya Xatenev
[04:26:53] <Xatenev> oke
[04:27:03] <Cork> though wildcard is prob not very usefull cause that would match the current element too
[04:27:22] <Cork> $(this).closest('*') == $(this)
[04:27:46] <Xatenev> Cork: sorry, with wildcard I meant basically this [id^=editor-]
[04:27:56] <Xatenev> so I find the element starting with editor- that is closest to my current element
[04:28:07] <Cork> Xatenev: ugg... you should never do that
[04:28:08] <Cork> ever
[04:28:13] <Xatenev> Cork: why?
[04:28:23] <Cork> cause you should use a class if you want to group elements
[04:28:30] <Cork> not use an id as an attribute
[04:28:40] <Cork> attribute selectors are SLOW
[04:29:11] <Xatenev> Cork: I cant change the HTML tbh
[04:29:15] <Cork> <elm id="editor-12"> => <elm id="editor-12" class="editor">
[04:29:16] <Xatenev> Cork: the HTML is generated by a 3rd party api
[04:29:23] <Cork> :/
[04:29:24] <Xatenev> Cork: and then included into our layout
[04:29:37] <Xatenev> Cork: It doesnt work aswell tho
[04:29:43] <Xatenev> $(this).closest('[id^=editor-]').attr('name')
[04:29:47] <Xatenev> Thats what I did.
[04:30:02] <Xatenev> brb
[04:30:03] <Cork> .closest('[id^="editor-"]')
[04:30:14] <Cork> always quote values in attribute selectors
[04:36:20] <Xatenev> re
[04:36:35] <Xatenev> tryin it
[04:37:38] <Xatenev> Hm thats undefnied still
[04:37:39] <Xatenev> w00t
[04:38:39] <Xatenev> Cork: http://hastebin.com/agufezufut.xml can you take a quick look maybe
[04:38:50] <Xatenev> $(this) is the div with the .editing class
[04:39:12] <Xatenev> I wanna retrieve the element one above
[04:41:45] <Cork> Xatenev: why not just closest('td') ?
[04:42:43] <Cork> or you mean you wanted the sibling?
[04:43:09] <Cork> i would use .prevAll('.tinymce-input') for that
[04:43:14] <Xatenev> Cork: yea thats what I meant sry
[04:44:27] <Xatenev> yea that works
[04:44:32] <Xatenev> I dont get why that .closest shit didnt work tho
[04:44:37] <Xatenev> (anyways this is a lot better)
[04:48:29] <RenokK> Anyone here that uses jquery draggable and ckeditor on the same element?
[04:49:53] <Kartagis> can I add a click handler to pseudo-elements?
[04:52:03] <RenokK> This is not possible; pseudo-elements are not part of the DOM at all so you can't bind any events directly to them, you can only bind to their parent elements.
[04:54:12] <RenokK> You could get this to work using the css "pointer-events" attribute. But that wont really work in IE. http://caniuse.com/#search=pointer-events
[04:55:19] <RenokK> Example: http://jsfiddle.net/ZWw3Z/70/
[05:11:35] <TedMed> Cork, i found a solution
[05:12:29] <Cork> Xatenev: sorry missed the question, the reason .closest doesn't work is cause .closest stands for .closestParent
[05:12:39] <TedMed> i include a javascript file where i have an array of scripts i want to include, also i have a function loadScript which takes a url as a parameter. I include the source file and rune the function with the url parameter
[05:12:43] <Xatenev> Cork: lol
[05:12:45] <Cork> Xatenev: it doesn't find random elements that are "close" to it
[05:12:47] <Xatenev> Cork: oh okay
[05:12:54] <Xatenev> Cork: the title is a little misleading :p
[05:12:59] <Cork> ya
[05:13:11] <Cork> Xatenev: closestParent isn't exactly correct either
[05:13:18] <Cork> cause it matches it self and its parents
[05:13:20] <TedMed> http://pastebin.com/m3jgryVx
[05:13:43] <Xatenev> Cork: yup
[05:13:47] <Cork> Kartagis: no, psudo elements can't be targeted with js
[05:14:36] <Cork> TedMed: you have to wait for the js to be loaded
[05:14:46] <Cork> you can't just each loop it and then try to access it
[05:14:59] <Cork> cause that will run before the script has been parsed
[05:15:15] <Cork> (guaranteed)
[05:18:45] <baako> Cork, i tried creating a new wrapper around id accordion the jquery ui accordion works but not has before https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/5/ it mixed the first 2 into 1 section
[05:19:56] <Cork> baako: you just made #test101 the accordion...
[05:20:14] <Cork> not sure what you think you would accomplish by doing that
[05:22:07] <baako> Cork, :( you said this before "Cork> baako: the problem isn't with template, it is with id="accordion""
[05:22:17] <baako> which is why i did that
[05:22:21] <Cork> uh
[05:22:36] <Cork> baako: you do $('#accordion').html()
[05:22:46] <Cork> it means everything inside it will be removed
[05:24:03] <baako> Cork, i understand that which i saved i closed it before i started <div id="NewCardContainer">
[05:26:59] <baako> in a way it works but the jquery ui accordion http://jqueryui.com/accordion/ isnt working has expected
[05:27:28] <baako> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/6/ i have remove thing around to make the naming less conversion
[05:28:09] <baako>  test101.html(simplate2(data, template)) everything in test101 will be removed
[05:36:59] <baako> i know what the issue is, i think. looks like jquery ui according seem to start Displaying collapsible content panel after the the selector
[05:37:27] <baako> so in my case the selector is accordion and the next element after that is test101
[05:37:49] <baako> but what i want is the next element to be h3
[05:38:43] <jerit> hmmm Cork, you know my thing about ensuring that only 1 row is selected... Well, if I'm deleting data from my table, might be better to be able to select multiple rows for that
[05:39:13] <jerit> thinking I do that in a $("table tr.is-selected").each(function () { // do ajax post to mvc controller to delete this row });
[05:39:16] <jerit> what do you think?
[05:41:22] <IamTrying> Is it possible to say jQuery is compatible with 80 Billion hardwares to make big impression to end user (like Oracle Java when you install they keep showing 3 billion devices use Java)
[05:48:50] <Xatenev> Why do I have to call .next()[0] instead of just .next() ?
[05:49:04] <Xatenev> .next() gives me some weird jquery object with one array element inside which is my actual .next() element
[06:03:31] <AdamPDotty> Xatenev: Basic jQuery behaviour. Most functions return "some weird jquery object".
[06:03:41] <AdamPDotty> This way you get used to it.
[06:04:35] <Xatenev> AdamPDotty: but normally they return "some weird jquery object" instead of "some weird jquery object inside  an array inside a weird jquery object"
[06:04:47] <Xatenev> ;)
[06:05:13] <jerit> wonder if I can sort my table's data alphabetically without querying the database again
[06:05:21] <kulelu88> I am trying to render each of my todo items into it's own <li>, but it seems that they are all being put into 1 <li>, can anyone investigate why: https://pastee.org/8kp67 ?
[06:05:29] <AdamPDotty> sorttable.js :-)
[06:05:33] <baako> jquery ui question. I want to get the accordion not to start at id="test101" but instead the h3 tag https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/6/ . looks like by default it after <div id="accordion"> which means by default the accordion classes get added to <div id="test101"> but i want it to add those classes to <h3> so that it looks like this https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/1/ hope i made sense
[06:05:38] <kulelu88> because someone from javascript said I must ask here
[06:06:09] <AdamPDotty> that was for baako, cause annoyin
[06:06:54] <baako> AdamPDotty dont make sense
[06:09:47] <AdamPDotty> Bob Dylan: Don't ask twice, it's all right
[06:26:06] <hellyeah> yo
[06:28:20] <kulelu88> lo
[06:28:55] <hellyeah> i think to give up using jsfiddle
[06:28:56] <baako> AdamPDotty, any solution or idea to the question
[06:29:03] <hellyeah> ops
[06:29:13] <hellyeah> baako:  what was the question?
[06:29:38] <baako> hellyeah, sorry this points to jdfiddle :)
[06:29:39] <baako>  I want to get the accordion not to start at id="test101" but instead the h3 tag https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/6/ . looks like by default it after <div id="accordion"> which means by default the accordion classes get added to <div id="test101"> but i want it to add those classes to <h3> so that it looks like this https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/1/ hope i made sense
[06:34:34] <hellyeah> sorry i dont know this one :d
[06:38:47] <baako> :) its okay
[06:39:19] <baako> have you used accordion before? hellyeah
[06:39:30] <hellyeah> no
[06:39:34] <hellyeah> unfortunately
[06:39:42] <baako> np hellyeah
[06:40:11] <hellyeah> you want to add it to h3
[06:40:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:41:19] <hellyeah> oh that is nice
[06:42:29] <baako> hellyeah, let me explain the idea maybe the logic can be changed. basically https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/6/ the "Pay with debit or credit card" option is might be static Visa **** 4242 exp6 / 2019 blah blah are data which gets sent via a jquery ajax response
[06:43:01] <hellyeah> make sense
[06:43:10] <baako> the idea is if a user cards saved show them their cards and they can pick which one to use or pay and also give them the option for them to add a new card
[06:43:25] <hellyeah> familiar
[06:43:37] <baako> so the give them the option to add a new card should always be they
[06:43:50] <hellyeah> basically you want credit card to somewhere for user in case they select same card againm
[06:44:00] <hellyeah> is that correct?
[06:45:28] <baako> the the add a new card option just in case the want to use a new card
[06:45:36] <baako> https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByGgvwO76KWTYXFLNXR3Tkw3bGs
[06:46:42] <hellyeah> once they used the card it will be remembered right
[06:46:48] <hellyeah> for later usage
[06:47:12] <hellyeah> and basically when user click the card they will show its information with jquery ui accordion
[06:47:13] <hellyeah> ?
[06:47:40] <hellyeah> i typed this before checking url
[06:48:45] <baako> hellyeah, ignore the "load" button it mights say do you want to pay with card when the user clicks on the button, it will show them accordion stuff
[06:49:17] <hellyeah> i got the picture
[06:49:19] <baako> so if the user doesnt have a card saved they will see "pay with debit or credit card"
[06:49:24] <hellyeah> i saw similar usage somewhere
[06:49:44] <hellyeah> you will get card information from backend right
[06:49:53] <hellyeah> i mean you can check json array has element or not
[06:49:56] <baako> but if they do they will see all their cards they have saved PLUS the option to pay with debit or credit card
[06:50:03] <hellyeah> then you can show whatever you want
[06:50:22] <baako> yes the information i from backend
[06:50:29] <baako> in the jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/6/
[06:50:43] <hellyeah> will you save your card "debit or credit card" in your db
[06:50:45] <baako> i have shown a jquery post to a function
[06:50:52] <baako> hellno
[06:50:58] <baako> payment gateway
[06:51:27] <baako> the issue is not the payment gateway its getting the structure which i want to display to the user
[06:52:17] <baako> https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/1/ is when i firsted tried it the structure in the example is right without me added the "Pay with debit or credit card"
[06:52:42] <hellyeah> btw load show all credit cards
[06:52:48] <baako> but i tried my actual logic here https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/6/ the structure of the accordion doesnt look right
[06:53:04] <hellyeah> how come?
[06:53:13] <baako> jquery ui accordion
[06:53:27] <baako> http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[06:53:34] <hellyeah> i understand
[06:53:44] <hellyeah> but what is the thing that doesnt look right
[06:53:53] <hellyeah> i will try to conversate with you
[06:53:58] <hellyeah> so someone can answer you
[06:54:18] <baako> look at the result when you click on the load button here https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/1/
[06:54:26] <baako> then look at here https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/6/
[06:54:42] <baako> the first one is the structure i want
[06:54:52] <baako> the second one looks messy
[06:55:10] <baako> plus accordion doesnt seem to work
[06:55:24] <hellyeah> yes i understand
[06:55:34] <hellyeah> thats you want to add accordion to h3?
[06:55:55] <baako> yes so that it looks like this https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/1/
[06:56:16] <baako> when the user clicks on the card it expends
[06:56:39] <baako> when the click on another it expends and closed the other one
[06:57:11] <hellyeah> i understand
[06:57:19] <hellyeah> but there is just one div
[06:57:35] <hellyeah> i mean there is no seperate div it seems
[06:58:30] <hellyeah> hope you got me
[06:58:45] <hellyeah> all credits card infos seems in one div instead of three different divs
[06:59:32] <baako> hellyeah, yes
[06:59:35] <baako> https://jsfiddle.net/baako/hgawhovx/ if you comment out the <div id="test"> and one of the closer </div> the accordion works but without it, it just put everything into one section
[06:59:53] <baako> somehow i need to get accordion to start working from h3
[07:04:55] <hellyeah> baako:  did you check accordion work with h3 tag
[07:05:05] <hellyeah> it may work with div only
[07:05:32] <hellyeah> for example i am using datepicker
[07:05:41] <hellyeah> you can use datepicker with input or div
[07:05:45] <baako> hellyeah, https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/7/ seem to work for the Pay with debit or credit card
[07:05:51] <baako> but not for the others
[07:06:38] <hellyeah> yes it seems like that
[07:06:41] <hellyeah> what did you change?
[07:07:56] <hellyeah> baako:
[07:08:10] <hellyeah> NewCardContainer is a div
[07:08:22] <hellyeah> h3 is not surrounded by a div
[07:08:42] <hellyeah> there is no div wrapping card information right now
[07:08:51] <hellyeah> why do you want to use h3?
[07:09:50] <hellyeah> it seems you need to use div
[07:09:56] <hellyeah> you can use h3 inside div tho
[07:11:04] <hellyeah> baako:  do you understand?,
[07:35:59] <freannrak> I've got the following jQuery operation that's causing huge performance issues (exponentially). https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bf6f336f4e72d7aed2d44b5645099342
[07:36:11] <freannrak> any quick advice before I dig into the source code?
[07:47:01] <AdamPDotty> $(".fluid-table").find(":visible:last").find('.cell-content')
[07:50:28] <AdamPDotty> plus: I still do not think it makes sense to have "table" in a class name.
[07:52:33] <freannrak> AdamPDotty: I agree, I'm optimizing the performance of a legacy jQuery app.
[07:52:59] <freannrak> AdamPDotty: Thanks a lot. I got the query down to 64ms from ~25000ms on a table with 1000 rows.
[07:53:07] <freannrak> victory!
[07:54:46] <konrados> how was it possible to be 25000ms even with the old query o_O ? With 1000 rows?
[07:55:44] <freannrak> I'm not sure, working on a brand new ('legacy') project.
[07:55:49] <konrados> I mean, I do understand that with the first query all 1000 rows were selected, but still, it's only 1000 of them.
[07:56:30] <konrados> AdamPDotty - then maybe you know the answer?
[07:56:41] <freannrak> hmm.. hold on. Looks like the query AdamPDotty provided is not exactly the same
[07:57:37] <konrados> freannrak - the same as yours? Of course it is not.
[07:57:51] <AdamPDotty> konrados: You do not need the rows as you won't find td or th outside of rows.
[07:58:52] <konrados> AdamPDotty I understand this, but still it's only 1000 rows. Selecting 1000 is so big deal?
[07:59:05] <konrados> *selecting 1000 html elements
[07:59:35] <AdamPDotty> I do not know the specifics but using the space in a selctor is a lot slower than .find().
[07:59:42] <AdamPDotty> e
[08:00:30] <freannrak> anyway, thanks a lot guys.
[08:01:56] <konrados> AdamPDotty I expected the opposite, thanks for the info!

[08:31:50] <AwkwardCough> up for interpretation I guess, bots are very hard to understand now adays
[08:32:19] <fiord> O.o
[08:43:15] <aro> can someone take a look at this? http://codepen.io/barrychapman/pen/mPowjP
[08:43:25] <aro> i cant figure out why the return from $.get isnt in the response
[08:43:54] <AwkwardCough> it's async dude, it doesn't return to the calling step
[08:44:18] <aro> i am using $.when though
[08:44:29] <AwkwardCough> instead of done() try then() possibly
[08:44:33] <aro> ok
[08:45:28] <aro> that didnt help :(
[08:45:35] <AwkwardCough> hmm
[08:45:39] <aro> i jsut want to return the content loaded by get when it is complete
[08:46:16] <shoky> aro: $.get(url).then(function(r) {  ... return r; }).then(function(response) { ... })
[08:46:31] <shoky> aro: or just..  $.get(url).done(function(r) { ... do everything here ...  })
[08:46:43] <aro> ok
[08:46:45] <AwkwardCough> ah, so it's the success is what's fking it up?
[08:46:50] <AwkwardCough> the chaining that is
[08:47:01] <Xatenev> AwkwardCough: ye
[08:47:14] <AwkwardCough> good to know.
[08:47:18] <Xatenev> you could do $.when($.get("...")).then(function(data) { console.log(data) }); aswell
[08:47:19] <Xatenev> :)
[08:47:19] <shoky> success is same as done
[08:47:31] <shoky> no reason to use $.when here, it's redundant
[08:47:44] <aro> when would be a time to use $.when
[08:48:01] <AwkwardCough> waiting on multiple deferreds to finish iirc
[08:48:07] <shoky> usually only when you want to wait for multiple promises and use $.when.apply
[08:48:49] <shoky> well, only using .apply if it's an unknown number of promises
[08:49:21] <baako> hellyeah
[08:49:34] <aro> excellent
[08:49:35] <aro> that worked
[08:49:36] <aro> thanks
[09:06:35] <taplar> i want a pony

[09:10:05] <taplar> ohhh, genuwine reference? ;)
[09:10:31] <shoky> ;p
[09:15:51] <baako> please i dont know what to do anything HELP https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/7/ the accordion seem to go to Pay with debit or credit card but doesnt apply to other h3 e.g. MasterCard **** 4444 exp5 / 2017  and Visa **** 4242 exp6 / 2019
[09:21:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  hey can you help me to find out bug in my program? Ç)
[09:21:31] <hellyeah> i did every suggestion you made
[09:21:43] <baako> hellyeah,
[09:21:51] <hellyeah> baako:  sup
[09:21:57] <hellyeah> did you do it?
[09:22:26] <baako> i read your message before you when off. i didnot quiet understand
[09:22:38] <hellyeah> baako:  let me repeat
[09:22:47] <hellyeah> the last part works right
[09:23:00] <hellyeah> but credit cards part not working
[09:23:04] <baako> yes
[09:23:13] <hellyeah> if you check your "element" tab
[09:23:25] <hellyeah> you will see last part is wrapped by a div
[09:23:35] <baako> yea
[09:23:40] <hellyeah> cards information is wrapped by h3
[09:23:45] <hellyeah> but there is no div there
[09:24:02] <hellyeah> i said may be you wrapped other things with div it can work
[09:24:03] <baako> card infor is not wrap in h3
[09:24:25] <baako> but i get what you mean
[09:24:48] <hellyeah> i may remember wrong
[09:25:11] <hellyeah> see the difference in last part and other  parts
[09:25:13] <hellyeah> you will see the difference
[09:25:20] <taplar> hellyeah: what bug?
[09:25:23] <hellyeah> be sure accordion works with h3 tag
[09:26:20] <baako> hellyeah, according to their api doc http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-header
[09:27:09] <hellyeah> taplar:  if you click datepicker title and any month in dialog or datepicker title var -> month list -> yearlist and select it doesnt go spesific year or month after getting dialog bo to the top  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/xjff0drs/27/
[09:27:49] <hellyeah> ah ic
[09:28:22] <hellyeah> well you state your selector inside accordion{{ thing
[09:28:35] <hellyeah> baako:  i am sure taplar can help you more
[09:28:38] <hellyeah> hmm lemme check
[09:28:40] <taplar> hellyeah: i'm not getting a year list
[09:28:43] <taplar> only the month list
[09:29:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  did you click 2016?
[09:29:22] <taplar> oh, right, sorry
[09:31:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  no problem
[09:32:18] <taplar> i don't see where in clicking of a box2 (the year) that your changing the date
[09:32:22] <hellyeah> baako:  that can help http://jsfiddle.net/JimUBC/d6mSA/
[09:33:13] <hellyeah> taplar:  i concerned this line should change it     $from.datepicker("setDate", currentDate).focus();
[09:33:14] <baako> hellyeah, that is the default example of jquery ui
[09:33:34] <baako> for accordion if you add anything after the accordion selector it goes wrong
[09:33:40] <hellyeah> oh
[09:34:02] <baako> http://jsfiddle.net/baako/d6mSA/999/
[09:34:22] <baako> same example has yours before what i did was add <div>
[09:34:28] <baako> after <div id="accordion">
[09:34:43] <hellyeah> yes i see sorry
[09:35:01] <taplar> hellyeah: that's in the handler for the month change
[09:35:05] <taplar> not the year
[09:35:08] <hellyeah> i didnt use accordion before it seems you should use div for getting accordion
[09:35:14] <hellyeah> ah
[09:35:17] <taplar> all your doing in the year one is closing modals
[09:35:33] <hellyeah> sec
[09:35:51] <hellyeah> currentDate.setFullYear(Number($("span.ui-dialog-title").text()), month);
[09:35:54] <baako> stackoverflow time i guess
[09:36:04] <hellyeah> this line should get year value, and month
[09:36:25] <hellyeah> am i wrong?
[09:36:39] <hellyeah> taplar:  it has worked before gettinr dialog boxes to the top
[09:37:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  sec
[09:39:30] <hellyeah> i dont understand it
[09:39:59] <taplar> you don't understand that your not changing the date and that the date is not changing?
[09:40:43] <hellyeah> date is not changing
[09:40:59] <hellyeah> i get mopnth and year value correctly i checked it
[09:45:22] <hellyeah> baako:  this is so example http://jsfiddle.net/frjyg/
[09:45:52] <baako> hellyeah, again   <h3><a href="#">Sports</a></h3>
[09:45:57] <baako> come after <div id="accordion">
[09:46:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xjff0drs/28/
[09:46:26] <taplar> ^hellyeah
[09:48:16] <hellyeah> taplar:  what did you change?
[09:48:31] <taplar> your box1 and 2 clicking
[09:49:34] <newbie07> taplar:  i am sorry can you say it again
[09:49:45] <taplar> your box1 and 2 clicking
[09:51:25] <hellyeah> ic
[09:51:39] <hellyeah> ic what you changed
[09:52:05] <baako> hellyeah, i have asked in stackoverflow hopefully someone who has had a similar issue sees it
[09:52:39] <hellyeah> the only thing i can give you as a suggestion
[09:52:47] <hellyeah> check example codes in jquery ui
[09:52:48] <nxplus> what is the issue specifically?
[09:52:54] <taplar> hellyeah: btw, $box1 and $box2 could be more readable it you named them what they actually are
[09:53:20] <hellyeah> taplar:  like monthBox and yearBox
[09:53:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:53:40] <taplar> something.  i had to search to figure out what they were.  it's a smell
[09:54:14] <baako> nxplus, https://jsfiddle.net/baako/07w55tyj/10/ when you click on the load button
[09:54:32] <baako> accordion ony works for Pay with debit or credit card
[09:54:53] <baako> it ignores the other h3 header for mastercard ... and visa ...
[09:55:07] <hellyeah> taplar:  it is smell
[09:55:09] <hellyeah> humm
[09:55:15] <hellyeah> what was this usage?
[09:55:25] <hellyeah> i forgot what smell means in that context
[09:55:26] <hellyeah> :D
[09:55:41] <taplar> a code smell.  it's a sign that something may be wrong, or could be done better
[09:55:58] <taplar> made more clear
[09:56:21] <taplar> might not, but a code smell always means you should investigate more and see if you can make it better
[09:56:38] <hellyeah> h3s not wrapped by a div
[09:56:45] <hellyeah> last one is wrapped baako
[09:56:55] <hellyeah> taplar:  thanks
[09:56:57] <decx> stop stacking divs
[09:57:04] <decx> you call accordion on #accordion only
[09:57:11] <taplar> hellyeah: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell
[09:57:39] <hellyeah> thanks taplar
[10:00:28] <hellyeah> /join #compiz
[10:04:00] <shoky> baako: maybe this helps.. https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/11/
[10:04:26] * hellyeah love those three guys taplar_afk, decx and shoky :)
[10:04:34] <baako> shoky, wtf
[10:05:16] <decx> i made the fake load button because it's loaded from a button ^^
[10:05:19] <baako> shoky, what did you do i cant notice any
[10:05:38] <shoky> baako: you looked at it for less than a minute and you're already asking questions?
[10:05:54] <baako> shoky, ahaha am just amazed
[10:06:10] <shoky> baako: when you keep it simple and follow the docs, stuff works ;p
[10:06:12] <baako> i see what you did
[10:06:24] <decx> just stop stacking divs inside each other
[10:06:37] <decx> my template function can only do so much :p
[10:10:20] <shoky> are you really storing cc numbers? :\
[10:11:07] <shoky> hope you know your PCI stuff :S
[10:13:27] <taplar_afk> :D
[10:13:57] <taplar> PCI sux
[10:16:30] <nxplus> what if you tried and set the accordion after the scope/angular is fully loaded?
[10:20:18] <shoky> nxplus problem already solved. also what does angular have to do with anything
[10:22:24] <nxplus> shoky: I noticed the {{xxxx}}, so what did I miss, what was the problem? hehe
[10:22:57] <shoky> nxplus: they weren't following the docs properly. accordions should contain only headers followed by content for each header,  not a bunch of nested divs
[10:24:58] <brickname> hi
[10:25:08] <taplar> aloha
[10:25:26] <nxplus> oh, ok
[10:25:27] <brickname> I am using a fuel ux step wizard and i am trying to override a function
[10:26:48] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[10:26:48] <brickname> on the event of click of next button i want to trigger my own function and then if everything is okay, i want the fuel ux to work normally
[10:27:03] <brickname> otherwise i don't want to propogate further
[10:27:41] <brickname> so i tried something like this - $('.btn-next').click(function(event){ event.preventDefault() .... my functionality })
[10:28:21] <brickname> the thing is, even before the click event.preventDefault() the fuel ux functionality for next() starts
[10:28:59] <taplar> looks like there is a 'actionclicked.fu.wizard' event that is fired when it's transitioning to the next step
[10:29:02] <brickname> i am trying to understand the meaning of this var e = $.Event( 'actionclicked.fu.wizard' ); in next()
[10:29:14] <AwkwardCough> http://getfuelux.com/javascript.html#wizard-usage-events
[10:31:08] <brickname> well i don't step change to happen as it says in the event doc
[10:31:18] <brickname> well i don't *want* step change to happen as it says in the event doc
[10:31:45] <taplar> right.... it says you can cancel it
[10:31:47] <brickname> and anyhow the event.preventDefault()
[10:31:53] <taplar> read the description for that event...
[10:38:51] <brickname> i added var e = $.Event( 'changed.fu.wizard' ) e.preventDefault(); in $('.btn-next').click()
[10:38:57] <brickname> still no effect
[10:39:16] <taplar> dude, that page has an example of how to bind on that event
[10:39:28] <taplar> right below the events...
[10:40:10] <taplar> you can't create your own event and then cancel it.  that does nothing
[10:43:02] <brickname> oh blind me
[10:44:59] <brickname> thanks all
[10:45:02] <AdamPDotty> if (stillNotCrashed) doNothingLoop();
[10:45:29] <taplar> o_O
[10:45:35] <brickname> feeling so stupid although i implemented everything reading off that doc, still i missed those details
[10:45:39] <brickname> thanks
[10:46:05] <taplar> it's cool
[10:47:21] <pokergod> i console.log(data); and see {"status":"OK"}.   if I console.log(d.status), I get undefined.
[10:47:43] <taplar> d.status or data.status ?
[10:47:50] <pokergod> data.status, rather
[10:48:01] <pokergod> comes up undefined
[10:48:21] <taplar> console.log(typeof data)
[10:48:57] <pokergod> object
[10:49:02] <taplar> humm
[10:49:18] <taplar> data.status should work then
[10:49:58] <pokergod> my bad, string
[10:50:07] <AdamPDotty> yep
[10:50:17] <AdamPDotty> should not be '"status"'
[10:50:28] <taplar> so you just need to parse it
[10:51:49] <AdamPDotty> console.log(data['"status"']);
[10:52:02] <AdamPDotty> but probably easier to fix earlier on
[10:52:11] <taplar> he said it's a string.  JSON.parse(data).status
[10:53:04] <AdamPDotty> I thought not data is the string but the key
[10:53:20] * AdamPDotty did data = {"status":"OK"}
[10:53:31] <taplar> which creates an object
[10:53:52] <AdamPDotty> without any key status
[10:54:08] <AdamPDotty> there is no data.status
[10:54:33] <AdamPDotty> ah moment
[10:54:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/7s5169gn/
[10:54:50] <AdamPDotty> That was the first try, that worked, then I did a second
[10:55:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/7s5169gn/1/
[10:56:07] <AdamPDotty> my guess was https://jsfiddle.net/7s5169gn/2
[10:56:48] <AdamPDotty> Yours might be more obvious.
[11:03:15] <pokergod> thx btw
[11:07:08] <vincentgabriel> Hello! I am having a problem with writing a plugin where events that are attached to an element within a container div are fired only on the last element. I never wrote a plugin before and did a lot of search online and i couldn’t find an example on using events with a plugin that attaches to multiple elements (by class name for example). Gist available https://gist.github.com/VinceG/0431f87bd121c9f8a953e8729fd4e8f2
[11:07:12] <vincentgabriel> Thank You.
[11:09:25] <jerit> Zix_ what is loganschools.org?
[11:10:16] <shoky> vincentgabriel: why are you using 'self' there?  stop using it
[11:10:22] <jerit> I HAVE A WHOLE CITY NAMED AFTER ME!? damn!
[11:10:51] <vincentgabriel> @shoky that’s one of the things i was trying. i tried multiple things to see what worked but none did.
[11:10:58] <shoky> vincentgabriel: that is, use `this` instead
[11:11:14] <decx> well self = this in the constructor
[11:11:21] <shoky> vincentgabriel: should work fine if you use `this` instead of `self` in line 38
[11:11:22] <vincentgabriel> this inside the even handler does not refer to the ‘this’ of plugin
[11:11:25] <shoky> and remove that  self = this line
[11:11:37] <shoky> vincentgabriel: but `plugin` does
[11:12:17] <shoky> and doing  plugin.removeSelectedItem.call(plugin)  does the same as  plugin.removeSelectedItem()
[11:15:16] <vincentgabriel> shoky: thank you. doing that, now inside removeSelectedItem console.log(plugin) returns undefined
[11:15:52] <shoky> vincentgabriel: right it's not defined there.. just use `this` there
[11:16:08] <shoky> or.. var plugin = this;  like you're doing in registerEvents
[11:16:52] <vincentgabriel> Dammit, that worked!
[11:16:56] <vincentgabriel> thanks a lot.
[11:17:00] <shoky> removeSelectedItem is not the event handler, btw
[11:17:02] <shoky> np
[11:17:19] <vincentgabriel> removeSelectedItem its not?
[11:17:35] <shoky> no, the function() { ..  on line 31  is the event handler
[11:17:40] <shoky> the function you pass to .on()
[11:18:31] <jak2000> hi.. all good morning!
[11:18:55] <shoky> g'eve
[11:19:04] <vincentgabriel> how do you call removeSelectedItem  then?
[11:19:53] <shoky> just a function... or a method on the plugin instances
[11:20:13] <shoky> if you pass remoevSelectedItem  to .on() directly, then it will be the event handler ;p
[11:20:30] <vincentgabriel> OK, is there a way to make it shorter like plugin.$element.on('click', 'button.remove-selected', plugin.removeSelectedItem); and stil have this work inside removeselecteditem?
[11:20:58] <shoky> yea, e.g. with bind    plugin.removeSelectedItem.bind(plugin)
[11:22:01] <vincentgabriel> plugin.$element.on('click', 'button.remove-selected', plugin.removeSelectedItem.bind(plugin));
[11:22:04] <vincentgabriel> this works
[11:22:11] <shoky> yup
[11:22:17] <vincentgabriel> thanks!
[11:22:26] <shoky> shure
[11:33:48] <vincentgabriel> One more, how would i refer to the actual button clicked inside removeSelectedItem?
[11:33:53] <vincentgabriel> should i use the event.target ?
[11:36:21] <shoky> vincentgabriel: event.currentTarget would be safer, but yea. of course, you can also store the button reference on the plugin instance and just access that
[11:36:40] <vincentgabriel> thanks, event.currentTarget seems to work
[13:25:00] <jose3_> what is this lint warning?
[13:25:21] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/enki9ewP/
[13:25:57] <jose3_> nevermind
[14:05:39] <z1haze> hey everyone. I have a question: Is it possible to do like a 'cut and paste' of elements to move them into diffrent containers? such as in mobile mode i want to move my header navigation into another submenu so it can all be part of the mobile nav
[14:06:10] <taplar> appending an existing element will move it
[14:35:23] <z1haze> how do i remove it from one and place it in another though taplar
[14:35:43] <taplar> that's what it does
[14:35:56] <taplar> an Element can only belong to one parent
[14:36:06] <taplar> so appending it to something else detaches it from the original
[14:36:23] <z1haze> sweet, thanks, anyway to be specific on where you place it, or only prepend and append?
[14:36:41] <z1haze> like what if i awnt it want the first <p> in a containre
[14:36:50] <taplar> any of those, append, prepend, insertBefore, insertAfter, etc.
[14:37:35] <taplar> what do you mean first p in a container?  selecting it, or putting that p as the first element?
[14:38:00] <z1haze> like <div><p>...</p> i want to place it here</div> for example
[14:38:16] <taplar> is there other stuff after the p?
[14:38:21] <z1haze> yep
[14:38:26] <z1haze> so basically in the midle of something
[14:39:14] <taplar> $theThingYourMoving.insertAfter($(containerSelector).children().filter('p').first());
[14:39:16] <taplar> something like that
[14:39:39] <z1haze> sweet, insertAfter i will make note of that
[14:39:42] <z1haze> thanks
[14:39:52] <phil213214> Hi everyone!
[14:40:18] <taplar> aloha
[14:44:10] <phil213214> How's everyone's day going?
[14:44:43] <fiord> pretty sweet here, just resolved an issue with one of my jekyll installations
[14:44:59] <fiord> how bout you
[14:47:09] <phil213214> Good, testing out IRC as potential prior art to invalidate a software patent
[14:47:15] <veggie_> fiord jekyll is cute isn't it? :D
[14:47:55] <fiord> veggie_ yea! I've been playing around with it for a few years but only recently actually built a few full sites with it
[14:48:35] <veggie_> That's true. There are loads of things to explore.
[14:49:12] <fiord> Yea, I'm a sucker for a minimal text/CLI-based workflow, so it fits well into my life
[14:49:25] <veggie_> Show me what you built.
[14:49:48] <veggie_> Hah, okay. ;)
[15:12:19] <itaipu> hi, I'm just testing a devel web service running locally, so I just called $.getJSON for it, problem is that chrome browser is getting me the error: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://devel:8080' is therefore not allowed access., there is a way to trick the browser ?
[15:12:52] <itaipu> not checking for this header
[15:22:42] <shoky> itaipu: you can have the server enable CORS by replying with the proper cors headers. it's not a trick :P
[15:23:02] <kegster> I have an API that basically allows me to store an X, Y coordinate with a width and height (in FRACTIONS of the page size, so not actual units) -- what's the best way to display pdf documents to a user and have them view where the rectangles are placed, and also draw their own (so i can save them via api)?
[15:27:04] <kegster> woops i think wrong channel i meant #javascript ha
[15:27:15] <kegster> although jquery may have a library hmmmmm
[15:36:19] <Cork> kegster: look for a plotter library
[15:37:01] <Cork> there is for both canvas and svg
[15:41:14] <kegster> Cork, interesting. i found things like JCanvas, but it's all drawn with the code
[15:41:21] <kegster> "plotter" tho
[15:41:52] <kegster> Cork, when i look up plotter, i find things like charts, graphs, etc
[15:57:53] <Cork> kegster: yes, and some of them has support for user interaction
[15:58:26] <Cork> raphaël.js is another lib you might want to look at
[15:59:54] <decx> how do you even write a trema e
[16:02:23] <Uhkis> ë ?
[16:04:48] <decx> right
[16:05:25] <decx> do you have a key or trema ¨ or do use like alt-keycode
[16:05:27] <Uhkis> depends on your layout obviously, on mine it's ¨+e :D
[16:05:28] <decx> for*
[16:05:38] <decx> oh so there's a key for it
[16:05:39] <decx> interesting
[16:05:48] <Uhkis> öä these guys are easier
[16:05:57] <decx> i got äöü and all kinds of accents, but not trema ¨
[16:07:00] <kegster> Cork, i saw that but it was frehand
[16:07:01] <kegster> freehand
[16:24:05] <taplar> that sounds like a lonely game
[16:47:20] <taplar> no one clapped for that?  guess your playing freehand
[16:48:04] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/qZiT0w5.gif
[16:48:05] <arc_> o_O
[16:55:19] <taplar> i can't see any bart picture and not start singing the bartman
[16:55:46] <taplar> or trouble
[19:30:22] <scrandaddy> Hey there. I'm having a strange problem on IE8 where the jQuery.camelCase() method is being called by jQuery (seemingly from trying to apply CSS properties) on an undefined value when it is expecting a string. This is causing an undesired error on the page. Has anyone has this problem before?
[21:20:40] <BenderRodriguez> Code
[22:00:51] <soreau> I'm trying http://loopj.com/jquery-simple-slider/ but moving outside of the window while grabbing the slider, the slider gets stuck to the mouse, as if it were being dragged, but the button-up event happened outside the window, until clicking on the slider again
[22:01:06] <soreau> is it a problem with this plugin or jquery sliders in general?
[22:02:14] <soreau> Ideally I'd like a slider that behaves such that when grabbed, the slider follows the mouse even if the mouse cursor isn't directly over the slider element
[22:05:33] <soreau> also after moving the slider to 0 it gets stuck
[22:05:58] <soreau> stuck = behaving as if it were grabbed when no mouse buttons are clicked
[22:08:11] <soreau> ah, only happens if the slider is close to the left side of the window, same deal, mouse button-up happens on the border of the window
[22:10:59] <JavaLover> how much resource does it take to say if(myvariable != null) ?
[22:16:02] <taplar> what do you mean 'resource'?
[22:17:35] <taplar> soreau: it's probably something to do with the mouse being released outside the window so there is no mouseup event
[22:18:07] <soreau> taplar: Are there enter/leave events?
[22:18:25] <taplar> i'm looking to see if there is an event when the mouse leaves the browser window
[22:19:33] <soreau> seems like this is an issue with the underlying implementation
[22:20:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/maayt993/ you could use mouseleave
[22:20:12] <taplar> yeah, it's a potential bug
[22:21:59] <taplar> if your inclined to do so, you could open an issue on the github
[22:23:15] <soreau> I guess it would be undesired behavior to be dragging the slider and accidentally go outside the window and suddenly it's not grabbed even though there was no mouseup
[22:23:49] <taplar> possibly.  as it is to correct it you just click
[22:24:27] <taplar> and if your using this element mainly on mobile devices, probably a mute point
[22:26:36] <soreau> it would probably need to track the state of the button(s) upon leaving and entering, if there is a button clicked on leaving, upon entering it would need to do nothing if a button is clicked, otherwise ungrab
[22:27:29] <taplar> sounds reasonable
[22:28:04] <soreau> to what github repo would the issue be targeted?
[22:28:30] <taplar> https://github.com/loopj/jquery-simple-slider/issues
[22:28:55] <taplar> there's a link to the github on the website
[22:29:02] <soreau> but that's the plugin
[22:29:07] <soreau> a plugin*
[22:29:14] <taplar> though.... you might not be in luck
[22:29:27] <soreau> jquery slider code never changes?
[22:29:27] <taplar> this thing hasn't been updated in atleast 2 years it looks like
[22:30:11] <taplar> have you considered http://jqueryui.com/slider/ ?
[22:31:11] <taplar> looks like it does not have the same issue
[22:31:35] <soreau> where's /resources/demos/style.css?
[22:31:56] <taplar> that's just for their demo page
[22:32:08] <taplar> you only need the themes one
[22:33:00] <taplar> if you don't want to do their download builder, you can grab the files from google cdn
[22:33:22] <taplar> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery-mobile
[22:33:38] <soreau> oh yea, much better
[22:34:01] <soreau> thanks taplar, I think I can work with this
[22:34:08] <taplar> good deal, :)
[23:08:19] <urmal_> i'm trying to use jquery's $.ajax function to send data to a PHP file, and return a JSON request, but on 'success' there is no data present whatsoever when i alert().  I tried the form without jQuery and it does indeed send a JSON response, but I can't pinpoint where I'm messing up with my code: http://pastebin.com/x58Nvfmm
[23:15:23] <jonez> urmal_, I'm afraid I don't know quite enough to answer clearly, but I will do my best to help you :)
[23:15:44] <urmal_> jonez, i appreciate any help.  is there anything specific that you need?
[23:16:13] <jonez> I would add a log entry on the php end that proves you are sending a json response
[23:16:42] <jonez> make sure it is proper
[23:16:58] <jonez> then on the js end, log what the php sends you and make sure *that* is proper
[23:17:22] <jonez> if php logs that it is sending a proper json response, but you get a null on the js side, you know where to start troubleshootin
[23:18:08] <jonez> urmal_, make sense?
[23:18:23] <urmal_> jonez, this is the json response produced from the PHP end: http://pastebin.com/uJLykqTd
[23:18:49] <urmal_> jonez, as far as the javascript end goes though, alert(data) on the success callback just says 'undefined'
[23:19:07] <urmal_> so there is no data being sent back period
[23:19:14] <jonez> urmal_, ok, so the php is sending a ... dictionary with a list value?
[23:19:33] <jonez> key is "status" and value is a list starting with "error"
[23:19:35] <urmal_> jonez, well it's being output through echo json_encode($response);
[23:19:47] <jonez> stick with me :)
[23:19:58] <urmal_> okay :3
[23:20:04] <jonez> am I correctly interpreting the json response?
[23:21:23] <urmal_> key is status, and its value is error. message is the list with all the respective messages for that.
[23:21:50] <jonez> ok, so you have a dict w two keys, "status" and "message"
[23:22:16] <urmal_> yes, that is correct.
[23:22:19] <jonez> ok
[23:22:28] <jonez> so on the js side, what do you gret?
[23:22:32] <jonez> s/gret/get/
[23:22:32] <b-ot> Correction, <jonez> so on the js side, what do you get?
[23:22:57] <jonez> you said 'undefined'?
[23:23:51] <jonez> urmal_, do you see where I am going with this?
[23:24:02] <urmal_> not exactly :/
[23:24:23] <jonez> ok, I will help more
[23:24:37] <jonez> it looks like your php is outputting the right bit of text
[23:24:50] <jonez> as in, json encoded, a dictionary with two keys which you say is as intended.
[23:25:01] <jonez> right?
[23:25:06] <urmal_> yes sir
[23:25:09] <jonez> ok
[23:25:20] <jonez> so now you need to debug the js end and why you get an 'undefined'
[23:25:44] <jonez> urmal_, are you using a linux distro?
[23:26:02] <urmal_> i'm on windows unfortunately
[23:26:11] <jonez> my thought is that you could use 'wget' or similar and do a request from the php and see if what you get on the client side is proper
[23:26:30] <jonez> I do not know the windows world anymore.
[23:26:32] <jonez> :(
[23:28:19] <jonez> more than likely you have messed up the .ajax call and for some reason your var is not populated
[23:28:40] <jonez> I suspect if you did a direct request to the php side, it would return a properly json encoded result which is what you want
[23:29:19] <jonez> urmal_, ok?
[23:34:07] <urmal_> alright
