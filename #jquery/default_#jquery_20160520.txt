[01:06:38] <spoonUltra> Hey guys. I'm trying to animate the slides to slide out when their button is clicked and slide back when any other button is clicked http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qZzpyz Am I taking the right approach to the 'complete' syntax of the animate function correctly?
[01:47:38] <King> Hi!
[01:48:03] <Guest79032> I'm new to jQuery
[01:48:24] <Guest79032> I want to learn a lot from you guys!
[01:49:04] <Guest79032> Is anybody here?
[01:56:10] <Guest79032> Hi!
[02:17:35] <hellyeah> yo
[03:55:53] <Duikb00t> Are there fullpgaejs users in the room?
[04:21:53] <nindustries> Hi guys, I need to create a load of divs based on json input. Each entry is http://pastie.org/pastes/10845000/text?key=kbnza1t30spfb6imhwr2sw   Any idea how I would best do this? Load the div in a string and replace placeholders?
[04:25:59] <AdamPDotty> why does this look like php?
[04:26:37] <nindustries> yeah, dont mind that
[04:29:27] <AdamPDotty> I do see some good practice, I see bad practice but no placeholders.
[04:29:53] <AdamPDotty> once you got some kind of html you can easily use it with jquery.
[06:26:06] <Duikb00t> I have a question. I am adding a resize handler and checking the width of a viewport
[06:26:47] <Duikb00t> But when I do that it occurs that I first have to 'scale' my screen a bit before it start detecting. What's the cleanest way to initalize immediatly the screensize ?
[06:27:47] <viewty> If I've got: <div id="something"></div> then <table>....</table> how can I add an ID to the <table> if I know it will be the first table after that particular div?
[06:27:58] <viewty> (Can't add an id to the table itself, it's generated automagically by something else)
[06:45:33] <AdamPDotty> $('#something').next('table').eq(0).prop('id', tableid);
[06:45:56] <Cork> .eq(0) isn't needed
[06:46:27] <Cork> also be careful with next('table') as it will only return anything if the closest next dom element is a table (else it returns nothing)
[06:46:45] <Cork> nextAll('table').first() is often a better option
[06:47:04] * AdamPDotty agrees
[06:56:25] <decx> i always accidently join selector channels
[06:56:36] <decx> #something').next('table').eq(0).prop('id isn't very active
[07:29:03] * spoonUltra sigh
[07:59:38] <Duikb00t> Someone an idea about my scaling issue I mentioned above? :)
[07:59:59] <decx> trigger resize
[08:00:09] <Duikb00t> yes
[08:00:17] <Duikb00t> But how to dit without 'resi`ing'
[08:00:19] <Duikb00t> resizing
[08:00:27] <decx> by triggering resize
[08:01:54] <phpcoder> hello
[08:02:10] <Duikb00t> You mean when doing document ready(onResize)
[08:02:20] <phpcoder> i am doing $html.find(".item").addClass('class1') and it works.......if i do $html.find(".item").data('test', '2') NO!
[08:02:31] <decx> no like .on('resize', myfunction).trigger('resize')
[08:03:06] <decx> data is added
[08:03:12] <Duikb00t> Confused
[08:03:21] <Duikb00t> On what element should I use that on method?
[08:03:25] <decx> you dont see that in the markup because that doesnt matter
[08:03:29] <decx> window
[08:04:22] <Duikb00t> $(window).on('resize',function() {       // do whatever     }).trigger('resize');
[08:04:31] <phpcoder> the data is not added
[08:04:35] <decx> it's added
[08:04:52] <Duikb00t> When using that decx is document reaady still needed?
[08:04:55] <decx> it won't be added to the html because that would be wasteful and stupid
[08:05:04] <decx> no window exists already
[08:06:15] <decx> data() saves into a hidden $._data cache to prevent unecessary lookups and allow for complex functions, objects references instead of just a string that dataset give
[08:07:11] <Duikb00t> decx:  Im jusing fullpage js but that trhows me now an error when scaling
[08:07:27] <Duikb00t> I want to stop using that fullPage.js thing when my window width is smaller then XX px
[08:08:35] <phpcoder> what can it be ?
[08:08:45] <decx> i explained it to you
[08:11:02] <phpcoder> decx, so how can i write data attributes?
[08:11:07] <phpcoder> what is the correct way ?
[08:11:15] <phpcoder> data-name="value"
[08:11:16] <decx> why would you
[08:11:18] <decx> doesnt make sense
[08:11:26] <phpcoder> why ?
[08:12:21] <decx> i told you
[08:12:52] <phpcoder> decx, i need to add something to get it back when there will be a "click"
[08:13:08] <decx> you cahn
[08:13:16] <decx> just get .data('key')
[08:14:17] <phpcoder> decx, yes but i need to add them first :D
[08:14:23] <decx> you did
[08:14:31] <decx> with data('key', val)
[08:15:28] <phpcoder> decx, so basciaclly you are telling me that if i do not see data-name on the tag it exists
[08:15:29] <phpcoder> right ?
[08:15:33] <phpcoder> i can get it later
[08:15:43] <decx> yeah because what's on the tag doesnt matter
[08:15:50] <decx> that would involve dom lookups
[08:15:57] <Cork> phpcoder: jquery uses a cache for data content
[08:16:12] <decx> the whole point of data() is to not have to do that while also allowing complex objects, array, functions and references
[08:16:15] <phpcoder> oh ok!! perfectt.
[08:16:19] <Cork> so what you see on the tag is only used if there isn't anything in the cache
[08:16:50] <phpcoder> makes sense
[08:16:52] <phpcoder> ok
[08:18:10] <Duikb00t> How can I only instantiate a plugin once? Seems rezing has brought a lot of trouble to it
[08:18:33] <Duikb00t> I only want to use it when the screen is smaller then xyz pixels . Ok
[08:19:09] <Duikb00t> Can I instantiate it 1st and then use it when needed in a way?
[08:19:10] <Cork> Duikb00t: you would have to have code to uninitialize it when the screen is bigger
[08:19:32] <decx> do it once on load, it doesn't make sense to optimize for that one person that goes from mobile size to desktop
[08:19:36] <Cork> else you would have it around if the screen area becomes bigger
[08:19:58] <gingitsune> I make a ajax request to $.ajax({url: '/ajax/document/page/record/5/'})
[08:20:40] <gingitsune> Just switched to https and I recieve a mixed content warning
[08:21:01] <Duikb00t> Dummy code: now it's like this: https://www.pastery.net/ztcydd/
[08:21:05] <Cork> gingitsune: is the server redirecting the call?
[08:21:31] <gingitsune> yes
[08:21:44] <Cork> then THAT is where things goes wrong
[08:21:48] <Cork> not in the ajax call
[08:21:56] <Cork> http redirects sends a location header
[08:22:09] <Cork> and your header most likely contains a hardcoded http://
[08:25:10] <Duikb00t> How would I uninitilalize that
[08:25:22] <Cork> it depends on the plugin
[08:25:26] <Duikb00t> Calling destroy no?
[08:25:33] <Cork> depends on the plugin
[08:25:42] <decx> dont bother with resize
[08:25:43] <Cork> some plugins doesn't support it
[08:25:49] <decx> init on load if the window is big enough
[08:25:53] <gingitsune> Cork: Thanks. That indeed was the case.
[08:26:05] <decx> nobody goes from desktop to mobile size apart from devs
[08:26:08] <gingitsune> Why do servers insist on appending a trailing slash?
[08:26:14] <Duikb00t> is it? :D
[08:26:19] <Duikb00t> haha Im always scaling
[08:26:34] <Cork> gingitsune: google stats optimization
[08:26:45] <Duikb00t> First time I use FullPage js  so that's why I stumbled upon this issue
[08:27:05] <Cork> gingitsune: you want to either use ending slash or not, not both cause then you divide visitors on two urls for the same content
[08:27:47] <gingitsune> Not my choice. Apperantly the framework deems trailing slashes the way to go
[08:28:42] <Cork> gingitsune: ya, it is quite commonly the direction choosen
[08:28:57] <Cork> but the reason is the same
[08:29:15] <Cork> (google lowers your rank if you provide the same content on two urls)
[08:29:16] <decx> who doesnt have trailing slashes these days
[08:29:31] <Cork> quite a few
[08:30:07] <Serg_Penguin> hi ! how can i _temporary_ add CSS to an element, and then forget it forever. Need to visually confirm AJAX success
[08:30:31] <Cork> Serg_Penguin: just set the style and then set the value to '' when your done
[08:30:52] <Cork> Serg_Penguin: though i would still recommend using a class and having the style in the css file as normal
[08:31:04] <Serg_Penguin> i.e. flash green border for a second, then turn back as it was
[08:31:19] <decx> you dont even need to remove the class then
[08:31:23] <Cork> ya, css3 animation
[08:31:23] <decx> just have a 1time animation
[08:31:23] <Serg_Penguin> i.e. i must set timeout, no short-cut function ?
[08:31:57] <Cork> Serg_Penguin: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation
[08:32:02] <Cork> also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition
[08:32:09] <Serg_Penguin> ok, will read
[08:39:28] <Duikb00t> bah fullpage .js a lot of things you have to keep in mind when you target different page isze
[08:39:30] <Duikb00t> sizes*
[08:43:17] <phpcoder> decx, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b25042fb44d524131a261680e8b5bb4a
[08:43:31] <phpcoder> i cannot get the value where there is a click event
[08:43:44] <phpcoder> only with find('.item')
[08:43:48] <decx> data hasnt an implied each
[08:44:17] <decx> so you only add data to the first item
[08:44:47] <decx> also entry isnt a string
[08:44:54] <decx> so you try to use a reference as a key
[08:46:20] <phpcoder> decx, entry = 'rif'
[08:46:37] <phpcoder> decx, yes i only have ONE .item
[08:47:05] <decx> then you do some weird shit
[08:48:17] <phpcoder> maybe
[08:48:18] <phpcoder> :D
[08:52:34] <momomo> is there a way to read the status code of a web page ( index file ) .. I am running a browser, and navigating to a url, and need to figure out if any errors occured when loading the page. Is there a way to do this, I am able to execute js on that page. Chrome console shows status code in inspector for all requests, basically i need it for the first request.
[08:56:01] <phpcoder> $('.tag-validated .remove').click(....)   $('.tag-not-validated .remove').click(...)
[08:56:05] <phpcoder> can i optimize it ?
[08:56:10] <phpcoder> i mean with ONE .click() ?
[08:56:27] <decx> like you would in css
[08:56:29] <momomo> phpcoder, uh, yes
[08:56:41] <phpcoder> with commas
[08:56:42] <phpcoder> oook
[08:56:43] <phpcoder> thanks
[09:20:22] <z1haze> what are the point of map files alongside your js?
[09:21:32] <z1haze> im reading an old gulp file from a person who no longer works at my job and im tasked with making all new ones for new projects and since no one knows how they work.. im trying to figure them out piece by piece to see what we need and what we dont
[09:26:18] <phpcoder> guys can i set the priority on a -click() event ?
[09:26:34] <phpcoder> i mean i would like my listener will be called before other .click()
[09:46:59] <Cork> phpcoder: no you can't
[09:47:16] <Cork> phpcoder: event handlers are called in bind order per element
[09:47:23] <Cork> and bubble order
[09:47:35] <Cork> so if you bind the event closer to the target it will fire earlier
[10:25:08] * replicator hello
[10:41:55] <hellyeah> yo
[10:58:05] <sonda> will the following bind all the elements with click event to the handler given
[10:58:21] <sonda> jQuery('[onclick]').bind('click', function() { console.log("found elements with onclick"); staying_in_site = true; });
[10:59:12] <sonda> or do I have to do jQuery('[onclick]').forEach (...)
[11:18:46] <hirsty> Hey all, anyone good with BloodHound?
[12:05:32] <jose3_> GUYS!!!
[12:05:37] <jose3_> anyone here evr use socket.io?

[12:26:29] <NoiseEee> yeah decx here too, its been a shitty cold spring so people are hankering for outdoor action
[12:43:12] <kulelu88> Hi all
[12:43:18] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[12:43:34] <kulelu88> I have a problem with my todo app for editing the contents of each todo more than 1 time: https://jsfiddle.net/1r5c3oeu/13/
[12:43:48] <kulelu88> console shows an error for the inlineedit.js file
[12:44:27] <robertmaxrees> how do i trigger the error?
[12:44:41] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[12:45:32] <robertmaxrees> so for starters, $editable = $('.editable'),
[12:45:48] <robertmaxrees> that saves editable at that particular point in time - looks like you change it in other places though.
[12:46:39] <robertmaxrees> so i'd start by fixing that.
[12:48:36] <kulelu88> I only see it being used in the edit function and being called in the load function robertmaxrees
[12:49:02] <robertmaxrees> var todo = $("<a>").addClass("editable ui-btn")
[12:49:13] <robertmaxrees> you're creating them after you store that selectore.
[12:49:16] <robertmaxrees> *selector
[12:50:13] <kulelu88> I assume that is where the issue is? robertmaxrees
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> that's an issue.  i'm not sure what exactly is causing your particular bug to be fair.
[12:50:44] <robertmaxrees> but i would start there.
[12:50:45] <kulelu88> let me show you the error message from inspector
[12:50:49] <robertmaxrees> i see the error.
[12:51:13] <robertmaxrees> it's something inside the plugin.  mind linking the docs?
[12:52:20] <kulelu88> looks like some widget typeerror issue: https://pastee.org/2amwq
[12:52:27] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[12:52:36] <robertmaxrees> i see the error duder.
[12:52:43] <robertmaxrees> mind linking the docs?
[12:52:57] <kulelu88> oh sorry
[12:53:01] <kulelu88> let me quickly check
[12:53:49] <kulelu88> robertmaxrees: https://github.com/caphun/jquery.inlineedit
[12:53:52] <robertmaxrees> also, .on() should be preferred to .delegate()  lookks like you need to do some general cleanup here.
[12:54:10] <robertmaxrees> Oh.  this is 2 years old.
[12:54:25] <kulelu88> afk. I will read your messages when I return robertmaxrees
[12:54:37] <robertmaxrees> i'll just wait until you get back ;)
[13:18:33] <kulelu88> I'm back. thanks for waiting robertmaxrees
[13:20:50] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[13:22:15] <robertmaxrees> so you're using a plugin that hasn't been touched in 2 years and some outdated methods.
[13:22:33] <robertmaxrees> i might address all of that first.
[13:23:02] <htmlend> How can one have text hidden on page load but on the click of the button make the text toggle on or off. Is it possible to use ajax to make it so the page doesnt load the text until the button is clicked (for improved pageload times). Would google still index this text?
[13:23:32] <robertmaxrees> htmlend how much text?
[13:23:56] <robertmaxrees> and google might index it, but that text wouldn't really have any bearing on your pagerank.
[13:24:28] <htmlend> robertmaxrees: A few paragraphs. The text will have some keywords that I imagine would have some seo benefit
[13:24:35] <robertmaxrees> htmlend errr.
[13:24:43] <robertmaxrees> so if you hide text on a page, google ignores it.
[13:24:49] <robertmaxrees> becuase they only care about text the user can see.
[13:25:02] <robertmaxrees> and a little bit of text won't really have any bearing on your pageweight.
[13:25:05] <decx> they actually penalize you for trying to hide keyword textwalls
[13:25:20] <robertmaxrees> ^ yeah if you do stuffing, it could ultimately hurt you.
[13:25:30] <robertmaxrees> but if you're not stuffing, it has no real net effecty.
[13:25:32] <htmlend> I wouldnt be stuffing
[13:25:39] <robertmaxrees> either wya, it wouldn't benefit you.
[13:25:42] <robertmaxrees> why are you hiding text?>
[13:26:12] <decx> right, only thing that matters is that machines can understand what that page is about and if people are linking to it
[13:26:21] <kulelu88> robertmaxrees: I built my app around this tutorial: http://web.koesbong.com/2011/01/24/sortable-and-editable-to-do-list-using-html5s-localstorage/
[13:26:23] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[13:26:32] <robertmaxrees> kulelu88 that article is 5 years old.
[13:26:50] <robertmaxrees> it might have some decent information, but a lot's changed since then.
[13:26:58] <decx> is this about the todo list?
[13:27:09] <robertmaxrees> yep ;)
[13:27:30] <decx> just use any tutorial of any reactive lib, it's todolists out the ass
[13:27:42] <robertmaxrees> http://todomvc.com/
[13:27:46] <robertmaxrees> or this site.
[13:28:03] <kulelu88> decx: I've been through all of those, but none of them explicitly support jquery mobile
[13:28:11] <kulelu88> which is the lib I want to use
[13:28:12] <robertmaxrees> kulelu88 then update them to?
[13:28:30] <robertmaxrees> like, you can change things.
[13:29:04] <kulelu88> robertmaxrees: I am also trying to build a non-todomvc clone. my clone should look more like this: https://rawgit.com/bicarbon8/todoTxtWebUi/master/index.html
[13:29:32] <robertmaxrees> right click -> view source -> ctrl + a, ctrl + c
[13:29:35] <htmlend> Its already a large page and the content shouldnt be displayed unless the user decides they want to see said content. So I want to do something like this http://tutsme-webdesign.info/tutorials/navs/tabs_fade.html depending on what tab they click text and images may display.
[13:30:04] <kulelu88> robertmaxrees: is my issue that inlineedit is too old for my jquery ?
[13:30:08] <robertmaxrees> htmlend then follow that example.
[13:30:11] <robertmaxrees> no need for any ajax.
[13:30:22] <robertmaxrees> kulelu88 your issue is all of your code is written for a 5 year old verison of jquery.
[13:30:29] <robertmaxrees> .delegate() fell out of favor a while ago.
[13:32:25] <kulelu88> robertmaxrees: apart from some outdated jquery bits, is inlineedit also incompatible? I believe there might be a built-in jquery solution, which I can investigate
[13:32:42] <robertmaxrees> kulelu88 i have no idea.  i would guess so since you're getting errors like that.
[13:32:55] <robertmaxrees> jquery itself doesn't offer any inline editing capabilities though.  mobile or ui might.
[13:33:29] <robertmaxrees> actually, neither does it looks like.
[13:33:39] <robertmaxrees> https://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/ is a thing.
[13:34:56] <kulelu88> thanks, I will investigate
[13:35:50] <htmlend> robertmaxrees: If I use this example http://tutsme-webdesign.info/tutorials/navs/tabs_fade.html wont all of the content in each tab be loaded on page load hence boggling down load times especially if alot of picture show up? If I use just the example provided would the content in each tab get indexed and have any seo benefit?
[13:40:44] <robertmaxrees> hgow many pictures?
[13:40:52] <htmlend> Sorry for all the questions. Since google deprecated their ajax crawlin I've been having trouble finding up to date information on the subject
[13:41:03] <htmlend> say 10 images
[13:41:04] <robertmaxrees> so back way up.
[13:41:10] <robertmaxrees> hahaha 10 images is nothing.
[13:41:16] <robertmaxrees> and don't worry about google or seo.,
[13:41:18] <robertmaxrees> worry about good UX.
[13:41:26] <htmlend> But 10 images will surely have an effect on load time wouldnt it?
[13:41:44] <robertmaxrees> it'll have an effect, but not as much as you think.
[13:41:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:41:48] <htmlend> each tab could have 10 images.
[13:41:53] <robertmaxrees> how big is each image?
[13:42:26] <robertmaxrees> you could do deferred image loading if you really want, but something tells me your overall pageweight is not that bad.
[13:42:28] <htmlend> We want to add as little load time as the page as possible
[13:42:46] <robertmaxrees> you realize the browser will download multiple things at a time, right?
[13:43:05] <robertmaxrees> and have you focused on compressing and resizing images?
[13:43:29] <robertmaxrees> make sure they're at a good quality level?  you can drop JPGs to like 70% most of the time and save a lot of space.
[13:43:56] <htmlend> load time currently is about 3.83 seconds based on what http://tools.pingdom.com/ says
[13:44:26] <robertmaxrees> like, "there could be 10 images" per tab doesn't really mean very much.  the amazon homepage has a ton of images on it, for instance.
[13:44:31] <htmlend> And yes I know about optimizing images.
[13:44:35] <robertmaxrees> probably around 100.
[13:45:06] <robertmaxrees> oh homepage is 30ish.  some other pages are around 100 images.  either way.
[13:45:11] <robertmaxrees> you can defer the image loading if you really want.
[13:45:14] <htmlend> Amazons load time is also much higher
[13:45:23] <robertmaxrees> load time is also not the entire story.
[13:45:35] <robertmaxrees> load time is not the metric you care about tbh.
[13:45:48] <arc_> the top of the page loads almost instantly. it doesn't really matter how long the rest of it takes
[13:45:54] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:46:04] <robertmaxrees> you care about how long it takes for the user to be able to interact with the page.
[13:46:11] <robertmaxrees> perceived load time is far more important.
[13:46:55] <robertmaxrees> if you really want to do deferred image loading, knock yourself out.  ajaxing content in?  not something i'd worry about./
[13:47:27] <htmlend> Percieved load time?
[13:47:46] <htmlend> I appreciate all of your help by the way. Thank you for your patience.
[13:48:54] <robertmaxrees> sure
[13:49:32] <htmlend> What did you mean by perceived load times?
[13:49:39] <robertmaxrees> explaining now.
[13:49:42] <robertmaxrees> so notice how amazon's homepage takes 13 seconds to load?
[13:50:47] <htmlend> yes
[13:50:58] <z1haze> if anyone uses browserify/gulp please take a look at this and tell me why it might not be writing to a file..http://dpaste.com/3ARMY9K the task runs, starts, finishes, but nothing is actually done
[13:51:04] <robertmaxrees> do you wait 13 seconds to interact with it?
[13:51:09] <htmlend> No
[13:51:25] <robertmaxrees> so how long does it "feel"?
[13:51:29] <robertmaxrees> a few seconds?
[13:52:21] <htmlend> The whole page seems to load far faster than 13 second for me
[13:52:27] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:52:34] <arc_> i also wonder if that tool includes loading stuff that a normal user has to scroll down to trigger loading of
[13:52:35] <robertmaxrees> so your percieved load time is much shorter.
[13:53:04] <htmlend> I just dont understand the percieved load time vs load time.
[13:53:17] <robertmaxrees> why are you confused?
[13:53:54] <htmlend> I would be able to tell if the page was not fully loaded.
[13:54:12] <robertmaxrees> so you wait to interact with the amazon homepage for almost 15 seconds?!
[13:54:46] <robertmaxrees> also: you're conflating your behavior with that of your end users.
[13:55:02] <htmlend> No I wouldnt wait. It never take 15 second. It loads within a mater of a second or two for me. The refresh button only stays an X for a mere second or to
[13:55:04] <arc_> the point is, a website is usually longer than one screen. as long as the stuff that appears on the screen before the user starts scrolling loads quickly, the rest of it is way less important
[13:55:04] <htmlend> two*
[13:55:17] <robertmaxrees> htmlend right - that's the percieved load time.
[13:55:27] <robertmaxrees> actual pageload analysis shows that it takes around 15 total seconds.
[13:55:34] <robertmaxrees> but you only really notice the first few seconds.
[13:56:00] <htmlend> So even after the X turn back into a refresh icon the page could still be loading?
[13:56:04] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[13:56:10] <robertmaxrees> other resources are still being fetched and loaded.
[13:56:20] <robertmaxrees> open your dev tools and watch the network tab.
[13:56:25] <htmlend> Ahh okay that clears it up for me
[13:56:58] <htmlend> And this tabbed toggle I showed earlier would be displayed toward the bottom of the page anyway
[13:58:17] <htmlend> So even if by default no content is displayed until a user clicks one of the tabs will it benefit in terms of seo?
[13:58:33] <robertmaxrees> it may.
[13:58:43] <robertmaxrees> you really need to worry less about seo and more about good content.
[13:58:52] <robertmaxrees> good content will also get you good seo.
[14:00:05] <robertmaxrees> also: just putting a page on the interbutts doesn't guarantee google will find it.
[14:01:42] <htmlend> robermaxrees: It is good content its very relevant information.
[14:01:43] <jose3_> any of you build the chat application for socket.io before?
[14:02:03] <robertmaxrees> htmlend i'm not disuading you from adding it, but you need to rethink your strategy.
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> jose3_ you'll probably have better luck in #Node.js
[14:30:06] <_jqueryNoob_> hey all,  I'm having an issue with getting an AJAX post working.  I'm using ASPNET WEB API and posting direct from HTML & Javascript.  I can post ok from fiddler but I am getting errors when trying to use the AJAX post.  Will post up a gist if anyone thinks they can help me, thanks
[14:30:34] <robertmaxrees> _jqueryNoob_ errr lol
[14:30:49] <_jqueryNoob_> what?
[14:30:50] <robertmaxrees> reverse your order of operations - post up the gist.  If somebody can help, they will.
[14:30:57] <_jqueryNoob_> ok, no probs
[14:30:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:36:41] <_jqueryNoob_> gist re my earlier question: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/50aa57b590644af05eec8f7fbc565251
[14:37:45] <robertmaxrees> console.log(itemName) - what do you get?
[14:38:40] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[14:38:41] <robertmaxrees> data: JSON.stringify(data),
[14:38:42] <_jqueryNoob_> List 3 - new ajax post
[14:38:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing that's your issue.
[14:38:49] <_jqueryNoob_> ok
[14:38:54] <robertmaxrees> don't stringify it.
[14:38:56] <robertmaxrees> see if that works.
[14:39:27] <_jqueryNoob_> nice one
[14:40:05] <robertmaxrees> the backend error looks like it's trying to access a property on an object that doesn't exist.
[14:40:18] <robertmaxrees> and your fiddler version doesn't use quotes around the data.
[14:43:36] <_jqueryNoob_> it works perfectly now.  This is my first AJAX post so I'm very thankful.  Do you think there is a more efficient way of doing what I am doing, looking at my gist?
[14:45:33] <robertmaxrees> well, coula things - what sort of browser support are you looking for?>
[14:47:42] <robertmaxrees> _jqueryNoob_
[14:52:29] <_jqueryNoob_> robertmaxrees: Honestly, I don't know.  I'm coming from learning backend in C# with a background in SQL so it's all a bit overwhelming.  I'm just trying to get some basic app working using Ajax and Web API
[15:40:24] <fuchstronaut> do I need jquery ui to have an dragend event ?

[17:08:58] * notchris-work is back
[17:09:27] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[17:10:39] <notchris-work> wooo
[17:11:18] <notchris-work> Almost got this playlist thing done
[17:12:10] <robertmaxrees> nice
[17:12:38] <notchris-work> robertmaxrees: Check out this thing im working on
[17:12:44] <notchris-work> It makes Bandcamp more of a library
[17:12:51] <notchris-work> http://chrismcgrane.com/bandcamp
[17:13:16] <notchris-work> (meant for mobile device)
[17:13:26] <robertmaxrees> iiinteresting.
[17:13:33] <notchris-work> Bandcamp disabled it’s API
[17:13:44] <notchris-work> So this uses cURL to scrape the search and generate their embedded player
[17:14:02] <robertmaxrees> you should check out python for your backend.
[17:14:06] <robertmaxrees> but neat otherwise.
[17:14:25] <notchris-work> I think jahan made that rec too, I need to learn more about python in general
[17:14:28] <notchris-work> and thank you!
[17:14:56] <robertmaxrees> Yeah.  Python with BeautifulSoup 4 would make this a snap.
[17:15:06] <robertmaxrees> i did a recent scraping project with that combo.
[17:15:21] <notchris-work> Cool! I’m gonna bookmark those and check them out after dinner
[17:15:47] <notchris-work> Wow I totally thought I was in frontend rn
[17:15:53] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:16:06] <robertmaxrees> i haven't been there in a while.  How is it these days?
[17:16:38] <notchris-work> Good! drej lives in London now so he’s now on as much, but Delta, jahan and BillC are on constantly, among others
[17:16:48] <notchris-work> emerson doesn’t come in anymore
[17:16:54] <robertmaxrees> i remember drej moving.
[17:16:54] <notchris-work> unless he’s on at night
[17:17:24] <fiord> emerson is still fairly active in #css
[17:17:45] <fiord> if it's the same person
[17:17:50] <notchris-work> Yes it is
[17:17:54] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:17:56] <notchris-work> I know he frequents that channel
[17:20:53] <notchris-work> robertmaxrees: Here’s the playlist portion I’m making
[17:20:56] <notchris-work> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/notchris/s3a3wy3v/
[17:21:13] <notchris-work> I’m trying to get it to generate the list items based off of the existing objects
[17:27:44] <cmrabet> Hi all
[17:28:00] <robertmaxrees> i'll take a look when i get some time, notchris-work :)
[17:28:12] <notchris-work> sounds good!
[17:28:19] <cmrabet> I having issues with .serialize() applied to a form, a get double values for everything. Can any one help? thanks
[17:28:43] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet sure - show your code in a fiddle.
[17:30:12] <cmrabet> https://jsfiddle.net/yp90q218/
[17:31:22] <robertmaxrees> forgot to include jquery - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yp90q218/1/
[17:31:32] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: oh, sorry
[17:31:58] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[17:33:56] <notchris-work> If I delete an object from a set of objects
[17:34:04] <notchris-work> delete playlist[0];
[17:34:13] <robertmaxrees> "set" being "array"?
[17:34:22] <notchris-work> Yes, sorry
[17:34:31] <cmrabet> the issue is that that code at my side is producing this:
[17:34:33] <cmrabet> save_configuration_roll_id=&save_configuration_roll_type=work&save_configuration_roll_metalurgy=&save_configuration_roll_hardness=&save_configuration_roll_mate_id=&save_configuration_roll_length=&save_configuration_roll_head_limit=&save_configuration_roll_tail_limit=&save_configuration_roll_linear_offset=&save_configuration_roll_id=&save_configuration_roll_type=work&save_configuration_roll_metalurgy=&save_configuration_roll_hardness=&save_conf
[17:34:33] <cmrabet> iguration_roll_mate_id=&save_configuration_roll_length=&save_configuration_roll_head_limit=&save_configuration_roll_tail_limit=&save_configuration_roll_linear_offset=
[17:34:36] <notchris-work> How can i reset the index so that the first item is not ‘null’
[17:34:36] <robertmaxrees> woah hey
[17:34:50] <robertmaxrees> notchris-work you don't want delete.
[17:34:59] <cmrabet> oops sorry, thought it was going to be shorter :(
[17:35:04] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet mind pasting that somewhere instead? :)
[17:35:11] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: sure, hold on
[17:35:33] <cmrabet> http://pastebin.com/jTBkCuz5
[17:35:36] <robertmaxrees> notchris-work https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[17:35:43] <notchris-work> thank you robertmaxrees
[17:35:43] <cmrabet> it does is twice for some reason
[17:36:29] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet try console.log($('form[name=saveConfigurationRollNew]').length);
[17:36:31] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[17:36:36] <cmrabet> ok, hold on
[17:37:18] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: it gives me 2 !!!
[17:37:23] <robertmaxrees> there you go ;)
[17:37:24] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: but the html has only one
[17:37:26] <cmrabet> ??
[17:37:37] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet how are you verifying that?
[17:37:43] <robertmaxrees> view source or the inspector?
[17:37:56] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: by looking at it, it has only one <form ..> </form> set
[17:38:04] <robertmaxrees> How are you looking at it?
[17:38:08] <robertmaxrees> via right-click, view source?
[17:38:13] <robertmaxrees> or via the element inspector in your dev tools?
[17:38:24] <cmrabet> via the source itself, I have the source
[17:38:29] <cmrabet> the one I pasted
[17:38:33] <robertmaxrees> right, so that's not reliable.
[17:38:37] <robertmaxrees> your browser sees it twice.
[17:38:41] <robertmaxrees> so look at what your browser is getti9ng.
[17:38:47] <robertmaxrees> maybe you're including things twice.
[17:39:01] <cmrabet> that's weird, twice the same form with the same weird name. let me check.
[17:41:49] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: here is the source code of the page, I don't see the form twice .. : http://pastebin.com/ALh8QBhZ
[17:42:04] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet is that via view source or the element inspector?
[17:42:18] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: that's via the view source
[17:42:24] <robertmaxrees> look via the element inspector.
[17:43:46] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: nop, only once
[17:44:01] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: the form is inside a bootbox dialog though
[17:44:21] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you open the dialog and THEN check?
[17:44:35] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: the dialog is open while I'm checking .. :)
[17:45:01] <robertmaxrees> no idea.
[17:45:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it then.
[17:45:26] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: anyway to find an element by name from the element inspector?
[17:45:38] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: I can then look for the form name and see how many it finds
[17:45:44] <robertmaxrees> just search for that string.
[17:45:56] <robertmaxrees> so you DIDN'T check via the inspector.
[17:48:10] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: just found it, its at the bottom of body, it seems bootbox creates a layer before the footer, wtf?
[17:48:25] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:48:28] <robertmaxrees> that's actually pretty common.
[17:48:28] <cmrabet> ohhhhh I know what happens
[17:49:11] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: I created the html of the box at the bottom of the page, and then I call bootbox with msg: set to that html.. so bootbox is not using the same html, is dubplicating it.
[17:49:23] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:49:27] <robertmaxrees> that's actually pretty common.
[17:49:46] <cmrabet> so what's the common solution to the serielize problem then?
[17:50:02] <robertmaxrees> you figure out how to target the one you care about.
[17:50:20] <robertmaxrees> there's often a wrapping container that gets added or a reference via the library you can hook into.
[17:50:27] <cmrabet> got it
[17:51:17] <dub54> hi, trying to create a fairly basic plugin, essentially a page switcher - I want to add a click event so if a[data-goto=*] is clicked it executes goToPage function, do I just add an onclick event inside the init function? http://pastie.org/10845888
[17:52:10] <cmrabet> got it working
[17:52:12] <cmrabet> thanks
[18:15:53] <dub54> hi, trying to create a fairly basic plugin, essentially a page switcher - I want to add a click event so if a[data-goto=*] is clicked it executes goToPage function, do I just add an onclick event inside the init function? http://pastie.org/10845888
[18:16:27] <robertmaxrees> dub54 i'd set up a delegated listener on the document.
[18:17:16] <robertmaxrees> also, you probably don't need to do $.smootho = function(element, options) { - just make that a function that isn't attached to the jquery object
[18:56:05] <dub54> robertmaxrees as in just function goToPage() { } ?
[18:56:37] <dub54> or like var Smootho = function() { }
[18:56:37] <jak2000> hi all
[18:56:49] <jak2000> how to hide a footer column in a  html table?
[18:57:13] <dub54> footer column?
[18:58:18] <arc_> you must mean row, otherwise i cannot make sense of that at all
[18:59:11] <robertmaxrees> dub54 either one.
[18:59:17] <robertmaxrees> I prefer the latter.
[19:03:01] <jak2000> yes
[19:03:49] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you mean a tfoot?
[19:08:39] <dub54> robertmaxrees sorry, js isn't my strong point, but something along the lines of this? http://pastie.org/10845965
[19:08:49] <robertmaxrees> err.
[19:08:50] <robertmaxrees> no...
[19:08:54] <dub54> oops
[19:09:18] <robertmaxrees> was literally just suggesting you replace $.smootho = function(element, options) { with var smootho = function(element, options) {
[19:12:11] <dub54> robertmaxrees and use in the same way? i get $.smootho is not a constructor
[19:12:22] <robertmaxrees> now it's just smootho
[19:12:24] <robertmaxrees> not in $
[19:12:33] <robertmaxrees> there's no reason to attach that function to the jquery object.
[21:27:06] <HowardwLo> is there a closest() but one that traverses sideways and up down the dom?
[22:33:43] <Lencl> hello
[22:33:55] <Lencl> Is .on('change') supposed to recognize html changes as well?
[22:34:48] <Lencl> ah nvm, looks like it's only for inputs/textareas
[22:50:21] <madprops> hi does .load waits until a gif is FULLY loaded?
