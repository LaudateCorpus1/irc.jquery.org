[14:17:48] <ocx32> hello all, i have some html that is server generated, i cannot modify. I can only modify the CSS this is the code: https://pastebin.com/hufpKPWK i would like to only make the first LI clickable and the others none clickable even if they have the a href tag how can i do that?
[14:18:28] <robertmaxrees> ask in #css :)
[14:21:37] <robertmaxrees> (for what it's worth your question is a super simple google search away ocx32)
[14:24:50] <ocx32> robertmaxrees can i do soemthinglike this? $('.eckb-breadcrumb-nav > li:nth-child(n + 1)').css('pointer-events': 'none');
[14:25:00] <robertmaxrees> don't use jquery for this.
[14:25:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/on1m09vp/
[14:25:07] <robertmaxrees> just plain ol' css.
[14:25:27] <ocx32> i cant i have to use jquery as i have access to jquery only, i just realized
[14:25:39] <robertmaxrees> that's a really strange requirement.
[14:25:44] <robertmaxrees> why can't you use CSS?
[14:26:40] <robertmaxrees> if you really have to use jquery, do this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/on1m09vp/1/
[14:28:04] <ocx32> thanks robertmaxrees
[14:28:20] <robertmaxrees> i would work on being able to actually add css fwiw.
[14:28:31] <ocx32> ok
[20:51:54] <znf> Is there any way for me to copy the events of the #id button and apply them to #hello in this example? https://jsfiddle.net/ncf3xm74/
[20:52:16] <znf> sorry, there's an extra </button> there
[20:54:01] <znf> Actually, I should rephrase. More like, I have a function written for #hi, but I want the function to also apply to #hello https://jsfiddle.net/ncf3xm74/
[21:11:20] <pavonia> znf: $("#hi, #hello").on(...)
[21:11:41] <pavonia> Or give the function a name and use it in two .on() calls
[21:12:32] <znf> I can't edit the function
[21:14:00] <znf> sadly it comes pre-packaged in the CMS I use and editing would be creating one more task for us to do manually when upgrading between versions
[21:14:10] <znf> and unfortunately everything is hardcoded in it https://pastie.dev/73fp0G.js (the ids)
[21:16:13] <pavonia> So you want to get the original handler first?
[21:17:14] <pavonia> This perhaps: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2518421/jquery-find-events-handlers-registered-with-an-object
[21:17:52] <znf> technically yeah, but I don't actually have those elements in my dom
[21:19:20] <znf> meh, maybe I should just duplicate it on my page and call it a day
[21:19:48] <pavonia> What do you mean by you don't have them on your DOM?
[21:20:35] <znf> I don't have a #stateinput on my page, for example
[21:22:53] <znf> actually it's just a bad idea overall
[21:23:39] <pavonia> If the element doesn't exits, you can't of course access its handlers
