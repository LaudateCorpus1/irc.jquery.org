[05:19:16] <JosefDe> Hi guys. Where can I build jQuery-theme for jQuery 1.10.1?
[05:19:36] <JosefDe> When I use this link, I can't select the version 1.10.1 anywhere: https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[07:54:03] <cluelessperson> Can someone tell me why this is too large and causing a scroll bar?
[07:54:05] <cluelessperson> http://cluelessperson.com/timer/index.html
[07:54:23] <cluelessperson> if you look at the source, I use jquery to set the size of the circle to the same height as the body?
[07:55:47] <drej> body/html have padding and margin by default
[07:56:14] <cluelessperson> hm
[07:57:25] <cluelessperson> drej, margin: 0, padding:0  still happens
[07:57:36] <cluelessperson> also, body is min-height: 100vh;
[09:21:58] <dannysantos> Can someone help me with a basic jquery error: I get an "ReferenceError: $ is not defined" when I run this file http://pastebin.com/AHcHMCrw . I have tried to figure out what's wrong but I can't. I have give up. Can somebody help me?
[09:22:59] <jerit> $ is not defined means that you haven't correctly referenced jquery in your html
[09:23:26] <jerit> add this into your page head <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
[09:24:21] <dannysantos> I have this tag: <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"></script> . Shouldn't it work?
[09:25:03] <jerit> yeah that should be fine, hang on, lemme check your pastebin
[09:26:05] <jerit> is main.js an actual file in the same folder as this html page?
[09:26:44] <dannysantos> I already figure it out
[09:26:55] <dannysantos> I got a proxy what was not up
[09:27:10] <dannysantos> so it didn't load the file on firefox
[09:27:26] <dannysantos> sorry to bother
[09:27:35] <dannysantos> silly me...
[09:28:33] <dannysantos> thanks jerit
[10:16:47] <fRAiLtY-> https://cl.ly/252q3N1Z1G0E & http://laravel.io/bin/Mkl4O trying to get the modal to open with the ID of the event of the row clicked. In the image you can see each row has a different ID (9 & 7) yet when I click the row to open the modal it’s not dynamic, just uses 7 which I’m guessing is the last one “set”. Any ideas?
[10:17:15] <fRAiLtY-> Someone told me to try ajax to “send” the ID to the modal so I can then use that ID within the modal i.e. $_POST[‘id’] as such, but not sure how :( or is there an easier way
[10:17:27] <fRAiLtY-> Rather than just “displaying” it as text I need to use it
[10:17:31] <fRAiLtY-> if that makes sense
[12:32:27] <Cypris> jquery-ui, sortable. the movable items can jump lists (which are actually divs), when i drop the item into its new spot it goes where it shouldn't. how do i redirect the drop to a certain container within the dropped area?
[13:51:28] <dddh_> hm
[13:53:19] <dddh_> there should be something like http://gojs.net/latest/samples/records.html
[13:53:37] <dddh_> to draw many-to-many relationships
[14:43:47] <dddh_> probably I'll try using d3js sankey
[15:08:00] <Side_FX> Does anyone have any experience with sortable?
[15:08:12] <Side_FX> I can't figure out how to save the order
[15:25:40] <Side_FX> how do I get erros to report on ajax calls?
[15:57:38] <kang00> Have you used any Web api on Web based ide or compiler?
[17:08:21] <jonkristian> I'm trying to toggle between position absolute and fixed on a menu during scroll down, while it is fixed the menu is top: -120px, this works fine, but while it changes from absolute to fixed there's a small moment where the menu goes down before it goes up, any ideas how I could fix this?
[18:04:55] <jak2000> how to paste a text that exist in the clipboard on #textArea
[21:29:25] <cjohnson> If I have an object var $f = $('#foo') and I do $f.someFunc = function() { ... };
[21:29:32] <cjohnson> Can I later re-select that object and get that function?
[21:29:58] <cjohnson> And if not, is there a better way I might attach a function to a specific node like that, without polluting the entire $.fn ?
[21:31:59] <shoky> cjohnson: no it doesn't stay on the element. you can use .data() for it i suppose. tho kinda odd to need to have a specific function per specific element
[21:33:32] <cjohnson> I'm adding a feature to an existing page with a pretty kludgy filtering mechanism, I don't want to write my code to assume it runs globally like this other bit of code does. So I can either keep the association via function scope, or by storing the reference on the element which makes writing hte code a little easier
[21:33:53] <cjohnson> If I had my druthers I'd do it totally different and rewrite existing page but client is tight on hours
[21:34:09] <cjohnson> thanks though .data() sounds like it'll be the right solution for this problem
[21:34:28] <shoky> shure
[21:34:31] <neilpdx> wouldn't this be a good use case for AJAX?
[21:34:52] <cjohnson> that's the #1 thing I said, the backend is going to be so much better at search
[21:35:16] <shoky> what does ajax have to do with it
[21:35:21] <cjohnson> the filtering part
[21:35:31] <cjohnson> right now filters are written as jquery selectors with a .hide/.show
[21:35:58] <shoky> oks
[22:52:40] <jak2000> how to paste a text that exist in the clipboard on #textArea
[23:29:48] <Darmani> How would I center this image on top of this other image?
[23:29:49] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/ew4rrwry/
[23:31:34] <taplar> that's more of a ##css question
[23:31:51] <Darmani> taplar: oh shit hahaha
[23:31:58] <Darmani> I have css open I thought I switched to that tab
