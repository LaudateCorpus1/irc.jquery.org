[02:30:38] <motka> how much query could a jquery query if jquery could query query?
[02:32:21] <Woet> sherlockholmes: seven.
[03:54:37] <rabbitfang> Can anyone help me: When making selections with jQuery (via jQuery(".example")), i am getting back values of type "Object". Any idea of whats going on?
[03:56:25] <rabbitfang> also, I'm making these selections within jQuery(document).ready()
[03:56:51] <rabbitfang> When I alert the value, i get "[object Object]"
[03:59:02] <rabbitfang> Anyone active here????
[03:59:13] <Creesch> sort of, just joined :P
[03:59:23] <rabbitfang> can you help out with a strange bug?
[04:00:28] <Creesch> possibly
[04:01:38] <rabbitfang> When making selections with jQuery (via jQuery(".example")), i am getting back values of type "Object". Any idea of whats going on? The selections are made within jQuery(document).ready. When I send out the value to an alert, I get "[object Object]". Also, when I try the selection later within the console (Chrome), it works fine.
[04:02:28] <Creesch> Well it looks like you are simply getting back a object
[04:02:36] <Creesch> what selection are you making precisely?
[04:03:11] <rabbitfang> jQuery(".project-list") (<div class="project-list">)
[04:03:40] <Creesch> if you use console.log though it will also show you what is in the object through the console
[04:03:47] <rabbitfang> and yeah, im just getting back an object. I tried it with doing .load() on the window, and it doesnt work
[04:04:18] <Creesch> uhm you are trying to select all divs with the class project-list class?
[04:04:23] <rabbitfang> This is what i got: ncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'sumbit' projects:85
[04:04:23] <rabbitfang> (anonymous function) projects:85
[04:04:23] <rabbitfang> l jquery.min.js:2
[04:04:23] <rabbitfang> c.fireWith jquery.min.js:2
[04:04:23] <rabbitfang> v.extend.ready jquery.min.js:2
[04:04:24] <rabbitfang> A
[04:04:49] <rabbitfang> there is only one project-class div. I also tried it with a form via an id selector, same issue
[04:05:21] <rabbitfang> and im using https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js
[04:05:31] <Creesch> jQuery(¨div.project-list¨)
[04:05:57] <rabbitfang> didnt work
[04:07:12] <Creesch> Can you paste your code in jsfiddle?
[04:07:44] <Creesch> in the meanwhile, is anyone familiar with https://github.com/axemclion/jquery-indexeddb ? I am working on a userscript where I want to store a lot of settings, but am not sure how well this plugin does work
[04:08:55] <rabbitfang> sure. ill need to cut down the code a little, for privacy reasons. ill make sure not to cut anything important
[04:11:16] <Schrostfutz> good morning
[04:12:00] <Creesch> good morning
[04:12:42] <Schrostfutz> is there an easy way of getting a list of the values of an object array entries? ie: a =  [{"a" : 1}, {"b" : 2}]; => "1,2"?
[04:13:39] <Creesch> do you want the values or the keys?
[04:13:50] <Schrostfutz> the values
[04:15:00] <rabbitfang> Creesch: http://jsfiddle.net/55XWm/2/
[04:15:16] <Schrostfutz> sry Creesch, i had a dc
[04:16:41] <Schrostfutz> did you write anything?
[04:16:53] <rabbitfang> he did not
[04:17:04] <Creesch> No sorry, looking at rabbitfang´s code right now
[04:17:48] <Schrostfutz> okay, i just worried i had missed anythig
[04:17:52] <Schrostfutz> *anything
[04:18:56] <Creesch> rabbitfang: so you want the value of the the form field if I read this correctly?
[04:19:24] <rabbitfang> well, the alert was just for debugging the issue
[04:19:51] <rabbitfang> the whole thing is supposed to verify the form input before it is sent over ajax
[04:19:54] <rabbitfang> validate*
[04:19:55] <Creesch> ok because with the value you define there you simply get the whole set of elements within the element with the id ¨comment-form¨
[04:20:08] <Creesch> so yeah that would give you a object
[04:21:18] <rabbitfang> ? but every other time i use the same syntax (outside of this snippit of code) (the same exact code even) it works fine
[04:24:34] <rabbitfang> okay. i figured out whats going on. thanks
[04:24:47] <Creesch> What was the issue?
[04:25:06] <rabbitfang> I really hate to admit this: I spelled submit wrong
[04:25:21] <rabbitfang> I swapped the b and the m
[04:25:26] <Creesch> :D happens to everyone, I did overlook it as well
[04:25:49] <Creesch> Anyway for the alert it is logical that you get the object, since it bundles everything
[04:25:49] <rabbitfang> thanks for your help.
[04:26:07] <Creesch> I believe jquery ui offers some great form validation as well
[04:26:11] <Creesch> less hassle ;)
[04:26:38] <rabbitfang> the thing that was confusing me was that when it errored to the console, it didnt give any more information than it being an object
[04:27:15] <Creesch> yeah that can be confusing indeed
[04:30:22] <Schrostfutz> Creesch: could you help me with my array now? =)
[04:30:37] <sherlock-holmes> Schrostfutz what's wrong with you array?
[04:30:41] <Creesch> Yes one second :)
[04:30:59] <Schrostfutz> sherlock-holmes: is there an easy way of getting a list of the values of an object array entries? ie: a =  [{"a" : 1}, {"b" : 2}]; => "1,2"?
[04:31:41] <Schrostfutz> oh, that example has an error, the keys are the same: [{"a" : 1}, {"a" : 2}]
[04:32:13] <sherlock-holmes> wait a sec please.
[04:37:34] <raj> I have <div id='container'><a>File</a><ul class='menu'><li>item1</li><li>item2</li></ul></div> ... but when the dropdown is shown, I want it to take into account the borders of the browser, so it doesn't pass the border
[04:37:38] <raj> how can I do this?
[04:37:54] <raj> when File is clicked
[04:38:00] <raj> File is the title of the menu item
[04:40:00] <sherlock-holmes> Schrostfutz - i think this is your solution: http://pastebin.com/T4pg3XvD
[04:42:11] <Creesch> Schrostfutz: http://jsfiddle.net/a6dwh/7/
[04:42:22] <Creesch> although sherlock-holmes one will also work
[04:42:46] <sherlock-holmes> :) Creesch
[04:43:29] <Creesch> Anyway, anyone familiar with https://github.com/axemclion/jquery-indexeddb
[04:43:34] <sherlock-holmes> raj, you should add at least href="#" to your <a> tag :)
[04:43:41] <Creesch> ? looking for some opinions about it
[05:15:05] <Schrostfutz> sherlock-holmes, Creesch: thanks for the work! i was distracted of the irc, sry =)

[06:28:49] <JesperA> ok bye

[06:49:18] <foofoobar> Hi
[06:49:39] <rindolf> foofoobar: hi.
[06:49:57] <foofoobar> I have a form with some <input type="file" ..> fields in it. Now I also get some files via Drag&Drop. How can I add these files to the form so when the form is submitted the files are also submitted
[06:59:41] <s25g5d4> can i give an array which contains one or more jquery objects to .append()?
[07:00:48] <SteveC> Try it, but my guess is that all elements will be appended to.
[07:07:21] <s25g5d4> it can, and all elements in that array are appended to where i specified
[07:09:44] <foofoobar> Any ideas for me?
[07:17:35] <s25g5d4> note: jQuery v1.7.2 can't give array to .append(), but v1.8.2 is ok.
[07:17:52] <foofoobar> Or is it possible to "transform" one of the "files" which were dropped to a hidden <input type="file" field ?
[07:20:15] <s25g5d4> http://jsfiddle.net/dEjJq/ act different with early versions
[07:34:43] <ShawnRisk> Why does my code here: http://pastebin.com/TheYcSXL give me the error: [cycle] terminating; too few slides: 1?  I have no ideas why this would do that.
[07:39:11] <_cb> Strange Problem: function vf_testit(){alert($("#id_bgmstatus").attr('cb_data'));alert($("#id_bgmstatus").attr('selectedIndex'));}; gives me the correct data but undefined for selectedIndex
[07:39:26] <_cb> correct data for cb_data
[07:46:35] <_cb> Wow found it. something very different between jquery 1.4.2 and jquery 1.8.3
[07:52:53] <monk3y> _cb: can I ask what difference you found?  Or did you just upgrade jQuery and it just started working?
[07:53:03] <monk3y> ShawnRisk: have you fixed your problem yet?
[07:54:45] <_cb> monk3y where do you guys paste code? I will paste an example and the only thing you do to break it is change jquery/1.4.2 too jquery/1.8
[07:55:07] <ShawnRisk> monk3y: nope
[07:55:24] <monk3y> Ah I haven't done it before, but the guys here use a few different services.  PasteBin is just for 'looking', whereas jsFiddle allows people to run/fiddle with it for you.
[07:55:30] <_cb> under 1.4.2 it the sample function returns  the selectedindex under 1.8 it returns undefined
[07:55:35] <monk3y> Google them both and give it a go.
[07:55:54] <monk3y> Have you googled for 'jquery 1.8 attr selectedIndex'?
[07:56:02] <monk3y> (if anyone else has had the problem, etc)
[07:56:17] <_cb> No, I have not. I just found that they work differently
[07:57:52] <monk3y> ShawnRisk: ok.  On a quick glance I couldn't see where you'd put out a debugging statement like what you describe (cycle terminating), but the very first thing I saw was your if statement (jquery .cover mouseenter); in both branches you hide the .cover.
[07:58:19] <ShawnRisk> monk3y: want me to pm you the site the slideshow is on?
[07:58:32] <_cb> http://pastebin.com/BGHZpKEE if anyone is interested at looking
[07:59:14] <monk3y> Nah that's ok for the moment Shawn, try this link first: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-cycle-plugin-cycle-terminating-too-few-slides-1
[08:00:31] <monk3y> _cb: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9685
[08:01:11] <_cb> monk3y found it. Starting with 1.6 on is supposed to use prop instead of attr to get the selectedIndex
[08:01:18] <monk3y> Gotcha.
[08:01:42] <_cb> http://api.jquery.com/prop/ That is going to break a lot of code ;(
[08:01:50] <ShawnRisk> monk3y: would be best for you to see the site as I am unsure how to make since that is not happenng.
[08:01:52] <ilian> if I use the following code: '/my_url/' + $(this).attr('data-id') I get something like '/my_url/[Object]' any ideas how to fix it?
[08:02:25] <_cb> selectedIndex, tagName, nodeName, nodeType, ownerDocument, defaultChecked, and defaultSelected should be retrieved and set with the .prop() method.
[08:02:55] <_cb> Ok going back to 1.4 until I have time to see what the differences are ;(
[08:04:14] <monk3y> .. regex search-replace of (.*)attr(.*selectedIndex) -> $1prop$2?  Heh.
[08:18:41] <_cb> monk3y I don't know if there are other things that changed aside from prop to attr
[08:50:28] <Schrostfutz> how can i insert css in the website?
[08:50:32] <Schrostfutz> *a
[09:02:12] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: hi.
[09:02:19] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: you can use .html(. ...)
[09:02:44] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: well, there are also CSS DOM (the DOM of the CSS) manipulation routines.
[09:02:54] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: is it something simple or more complex?
[09:03:05] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: toggling a class is easy.
[09:03:20] <Schrostfutz> i want to append some ne classes
[09:03:54] <Schrostfutz> i want to insert this: http://nopaste.info/dcb62a0689.html
[09:05:14] <Schrostfutz> could i just remove the whitespaces and append it to the head element?
[09:12:52] <Schrostfutz> rindolf: ah, i found an easy way, thanks anyway =)
[09:13:45] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: you're welcome.
[09:13:54] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: what did you find?
[09:14:21] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: jQ has some functions for manipulating classes (adding removing toggling etc.)
[09:14:38] <rindolf> Well, methods.
[09:15:48] <Schrostfutz> im using jquery for a chrome extension. they enable me to load my own css files on matched websites aside with javascript
[09:26:14] <Schrostfutz> will there be problems if i use yui and jquery at the same time?
[09:32:33] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: there may be.

[10:28:49] <t432> Anyone spot anything wrong with this? $('#foo').click(function(){$('#form').ajaxSubmit();});}); (foo element  is reference to radio button)
[10:29:39] <snover> ajaxSubmit isnât a thing, so thereâs that
[10:30:35] <t432> snover: tried submit()
[10:30:53] <snover> that will trigger a submit event, not call the submit method of the form
[10:31:39] <t432> what is the right method?
[10:31:47] <JesperA> isnt ajaxSubmit from the Ajax Form plugin so it actually is a method for submitting the form
[10:32:55] <t432> JesperA: Yes I think so
[10:33:49] <snover> actually, nevermind, it will call submit on the form
[10:33:56] <JesperA> t432 yeah so you will have to pass some parameters in ajaxSubmit, something like ajaxSubmit({url: 'something.php', type: 'post'})
[10:34:07] <snover> so. testcase.
[10:34:47] <t432> JesperA: I'm already doing that in the form, I'd just like to submit the form when a radio button is clicked
[10:35:50] <t432> do i need a form submit button within the form? I only have the radio buttons
[10:36:21] <JesperA> test
[10:37:38] <JesperA> but seriously, why not just the built in .ajax function so you dont need to rely on a plugin that does exactly the same as the Form submit plugin
[10:40:00] <t432> i dindt think of it. how would that work
[10:41:13] <JesperA> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6960586
[10:45:58] <noregret> anybody uses fineuploader pluging?
[10:48:32] <t432> JesperA: see anything wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/4yjz1FQG
[10:50:00] <t432> ajaxSubmit() shoould be "submit()"
[10:50:08] <t432> in that pastebin

[11:41:03] <anew> lol
[11:41:29] <anew> well noob question render for backbone.view.extend... i mean what is the definition of this
[11:42:28] <anew> ok nevermind
[11:42:34] <anew> puts the markup in the elements
[11:46:50] <anew>  http://jsfiddle.net/9pRjZ/1/ why does this not show 'loading' at all and goes straight to 'hello world' ?
[11:48:23] <anew> nevermind
[11:57:46] <jefffan24> Is there a true replacement for .live().  So far in my experience using .on, if I add a element to the page after .on has been set (say an ajax call 5 seconds after page has loaded adds a div to the page for some reason)
[11:57:57] <jefffan24> I have to redo my .on call in that ajax event to include that div
[11:58:14] <jefffan24> if I used .live() I never had that issue, it included pre-loaded and post-loaded elements
[11:58:49] <Cronoh> i dont use .live and all of my elements are added after the fact
[11:58:52] <Cronoh> wait wat!
[11:59:13] <jefffan24> lol lets say on page load we have <div class="stuff"></div>
[11:59:33] <jefffan24> I set a $('.stuff').on('click',do something);
[11:59:52] <jefffan24> then 5 seconds later in an ajax call I do: $('body').append('<div class="stuff"></div>');
[11:59:55] <Cronoh> $(document).on('click', '.stuff', function (){});
[12:00:07] <jefffan24> so that will make it live?
[12:00:10] <Cronoh> yes
[12:00:16] <jefffan24> ahh ok thanks
[12:00:20] <jefffan24> will give it a shot!
[12:00:25] <Cronoh> ok good luck let me kno
[12:01:57] <fr0zenice> jefffan24: you can also use some other element instead of document, further down the tree (but still a parent of .stuff), if you know that it's always there, so events don't need to bubble up that far
[12:05:56] <jefffan24> awesome that worked took both your advices :)
[12:06:22] <jefffan24> Had a container that I used as the parent, and Cronoh your .on('method','class',function) worked as well
[12:06:25] <jefffan24> thanks guys

[12:24:28] <Schrostfutz> hi, i was just wondering: with $('div') i select all divs on the page. and mit var div = $('div'); i create a new div. how does the interpreter get the difference?
[12:25:06] <systemfault> var div = $('div'); doesn't create a new div.
[12:25:15] <beachandbytes> it creates a variable with all the divs
[12:25:26] <jedimind> systemfault, why would it ?
[12:25:29] <beachandbytes> var div = $('<div></div>');
[12:25:30] <systemfault> It "selects all divs" on the page
[12:25:33] <beachandbytes> creates new div
[12:25:45] <systemfault> I was answering Schrostfutz's question..
[12:27:35] <SP33D> ok hopefully you got a solution for my problem too
[12:27:37] <KarateKip3> systemfault: $('<div>'); is not a system fault
[12:27:45] <SP33D> since i don't understand why that happens :D
[12:29:26] <systemfault> SP33D: Try setting the src of the image after setting the load event.
[12:30:15] <KarateKip3> systemfault: create DIV with id='systemfault' and put it in another div called 'body': $("<div />", {id:"systemfault"}).appendTo("#body");
[12:30:50] <systemfault> KarateKip3: I know jquery, kthx.
[12:31:21] <shoky> SP33D: try encodeURI

[12:32:20] <shoky> we're happy too
[12:33:11] <KarateKip3> systemfault: oh sorry, i didn't read back the whole log :)
[12:33:23] <systemfault> No problem :)
[12:35:42] <KarateKip3> sometimes i just glance in some channels, read back the last 4 lines and start answering questions as if i've been reading along the whole time
[12:36:12] <SP33D> shoky :D
[12:36:17] <SP33D> help me again http://jsfiddle.net/D2abU/6/
[12:36:31] <SP33D> now there is a problem when the folder contains extra signs
[12:37:32] <SP33D> but now the src is url encoded
[12:37:41] <SP33D> so what can i do now :(
[12:38:27] <beachandbytes> which sign is messing it up?
[12:38:37] <SP33D> not sure :D
[12:38:44] <SP33D> i thin ()
[12:39:40] <SP33D> and it has problems when the file contains ,
[12:39:52] <Krambiorix> hi , does anyone know http://www.JavascriptToolbox.com/lib/contextmenu/ ?
[12:40:08] <Krambiorix> i'm sorry, i meant : http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/index.html
[12:40:49] <KarateKip3> hey wait!
[12:41:24] <shoky> SP33D: http://jsfiddle.net/D2abU/7/
[12:41:34] <shoky> tho that's pretty gross, there's prolly a nicer way
[12:42:17] <shoky> basically i wanted to pass the url to escape()  but that also escaped the http://  so i needed to preserve that
[12:42:44] <SP33D> hmmmm
[12:42:55] <SP33D> i am trying to understand what you did :D
[12:43:00] <SP33D>     src = src.slice(0, src.indexOf('//') + 2) + escape(src.slice(src.indexOf('//') + 2));
[12:43:02] <SP33D> :D
[12:43:05] <shoky> yeh :\
[12:43:13] <SP33D> i don't understand it but it works
[12:43:18] <shoky> first slice  takes the http://
[12:43:26] <KarateKip3> the link http://www.JavascriptToolbox.com/lib/contextmenu/ that Krambiorix just posted contains a context menu when u press right mouse button. But how come that Firefox doesn't intercept that right mouse button and display its own context menu? 1) How do I make my own context menu and 2) how to add options to the firefox context menu?
[12:43:32] <shoky> second slice takes the rest of the URL, and i only pass this second slice to escape()
[12:44:02] <SP33D> hmmmm ah i understand
[12:44:09] <SP33D> and escape adds escape marks
[12:44:14] <SP33D> so that the spezial chars work?`
[12:44:23] <shoky> ye cause encodeURI didn't escape the () chars
[12:44:36] <SP33D> thx a lot now i understand it ^^
[12:44:37] <shoky> dono whats up with that really
[12:44:41] <shoky> np
[12:45:33] <KarateKip3> oh wait... sorry
[12:46:53] <Krambiorix> i have a target object, but how can i get the event object from that?  I need it to use event.preventDefault()
[12:47:44] <KarateKip3> Krambiorix: pass parameter 'event' to that function
[12:55:01] <KarateKip3> is there any way to get google suggest on my website? I now realize that this is impossible because of cross domain policies. So how should this be done?
[12:56:45] <astropirate> KarateKip3, write a server component
[12:56:52] <astropirate> or see if google has an api for it
[12:57:06] <astropirate> for the server compnent
[12:57:20] <astropirate> google will probably block it, if it gets too many requests from the same IP
[12:58:03] <KarateKip3> i was looking for the api, but it's just a URL which is not usable from javascript. Yeah, the server component I thought bout that, but as you said too many request can be a problem :(
[12:58:07] <beachandbytes> use proxies in your server component
[12:58:28] <beachandbytes> but no easy way :(
[12:58:44] <KarateKip3> beachandbytes: i would need to use a lot of proxies in my case... :(
[13:00:30] <astropirate> yah i was thinking the same
[13:00:38] <astropirate> the proxy solution isn't really scalable
[13:01:57] <KarateKip3> astropirate: but you could write something that detects when there are no results from google, that it should try another proxy, right?
[13:02:22] <astropirate> KarateKip3, well yah
[13:02:25] <astropirate> but you have to think
[13:02:31] <astropirate> is it really worth it?
[13:02:37] <astropirate> do you absolutely need this featue
[13:02:43] <astropirate> to go to all that trouble
[13:02:53] <beachandbytes> If you have enough requests to need alot of proxies its probably not worth it
[13:02:54] <astropirate> of not just developing but also maintaining that feature
[13:02:58] <KarateKip3> astropirate: yeah, in this case it's the customer who is king
[13:03:04] <astropirate> ahhh
[13:03:11] <astropirate> silly client ehh?
[13:03:26] <KarateKip3> astropirate: sort ah
[13:03:29] <beachandbytes> Implementing something against the google terms of service for a client seems bad news
[13:03:53] <KarateKip3> beachandbytes: no, i'm looking for a legal way
[13:04:04] <beachandbytes> well its legal just against TOS
[13:04:11] <beachandbytes> so no crime just get sued
[13:04:22] <KarateKip3> hmm...
[13:09:47] <KarateKip3> other question. Dynamic CSS with jQuery. Is there any way to do dynamic CSS in just CSS-files? Or should that be done with javascript only? Two examples: when option is selected, there will be rounded corners. Or: you don't know in advance how big the DIV boxes are, they can be resized dynamically by the user etc.
[13:10:34] <KarateKip3> I never heard anything other than "CSS should be done in CSS-files only", but i don't know about dynamic CSS and best practices
[13:12:04] <tw2113> chances are i'd declare the classes in the css, and then use add/remove/toggleClass
[13:12:18] <tw2113> but that's how my head works
[13:15:54] <KarateKip3> tw2113: that's a good one. but if there's a class with: width = screenwidth / 2; how bout that?
[13:18:24] <graft> hi, what's the correct way to attach events to the creation of elements with a certain attribute?
[13:18:47] <graft> i tried $(document).on('ready','[data-my-attrib]',...), but that didn't seem to fire
[13:25:10] <NivenHuH> is there a reason why $.mobile.changePage( "http://somesitehere.com" ); wouldn't do anything?
[13:25:38] <NivenHuH> no raised exceptions
[13:30:16] <NivenHuH> $.mobile.allowCrossDomainPages and $.support.cors is true, and in phonegap, the hosts are whitelisted (i'm able to call $.ajax and get info)
[13:46:30] <amaroks> Hello
[13:48:10] <amaroks> $(xml).find([id='3']).each() This finds xml elements that have attribute id with value of 3, How do I make it find elements where id > x and less < y ?
[13:56:31] <systemfault> Select all elementsâ¦ get their id, parse them to numbers and compare them.
[13:56:47] <systemfault> Not even sure that a number is a valid id in XML
[13:58:40] <systemfault> Nevermind, has xhtml in mind

[14:13:09] <yogurt_truck> motherflippin spammers
[14:13:28] <yogurt_truck> motherflippers think everything's a motherflipping joke
[14:14:31] <SteveC> So, jquery tries to be smart about html and strips out closing tags from tags that don't need them in HTML (e.g. img).  However, it also does this to XHTML files that do close all tags..  any way of stopping it from doing it?
[14:14:53] <shesek> SteveC, I don't think its jQuery that does that
[14:15:02] <shesek> its probably your browser's HTML parser
[14:15:18] <SteveC> shesek: It's the $().append() function..
[14:15:56] <shesek> SteveC, which uses your browser HTML parser, if you feed it with HTML
[14:16:30] <systemfault> SteveC: Do you close an <img> tag?!
[14:16:44] <SteveC> hmm, ok...  yes, I close it in my code...
[14:16:51] <SteveC> you close them in xhtml
[14:17:16] <systemfault> SteveC: No, img is self closing, in xhtml you would do: <img src="" alt="" />
[14:17:32] <systemfault> Not <img src="" alt=""></img>
[14:17:48] <Krambiorix> hi guys, can someone help? http://pastebin.com/T9BQVyqn    when the ajax call should happen, my page gets refreshed...
[14:18:05] <systemfault> Anyway.. XHTML is pretty much dead.
[14:18:24] <graft> who cares?
[14:19:05] <systemfault> Ninjas with purple scarfs do.
[14:19:37] <yogurt_truck> xhtml is so pre-12/12/12
[14:19:46] <graft> urgh.. how do i get jquery to tell me when elements are created?
[14:20:10] <graft> i can do stuff in .ready(), but that only works on page load, not when i pop stuff in with ajax
[14:20:25] <graft> and, yes, i can put stuff in my ajax callback, but i shouldn't have to, dammit
[14:21:13] <systemfault> graft: That's usually the only way, unless it's for events.. then in most cases, you can use event delegation (The second form of .on)
[14:21:52] <graft> why can't i do .on('ready',selector)?
[14:22:05] <ryanneufeld> graft: cause it doesn't work that way
[14:22:17] <systemfault> Because "ready" is for the document only
[14:22:18] <graft> does .on('ready') do anything?
[14:22:27] <ryanneufeld> `tias
[14:22:27] <b-ot> ryanneufeld, Try it and see
[14:23:59] <graft> well, $(document).on('ready') works, but $(document).on('ready',selector) doesn't
[14:23:59] <ryanneufeld> graft: I'm pretty sure it doesn't do what you want it to do
[14:24:18] <ryanneufeld> that's because document ready is a special event
[14:24:19] <systemfault> Because it doesn't make sense...
[14:24:24] <ryanneufeld> and it only fires once
[14:24:37] <graft> what about element.ready()?
[14:24:42] <ryanneufeld> nope
[14:24:51] <graft> doesn't anything fire when i inject some ajax elements in?
[14:24:52] <systemfault> Document ONLY.
[14:24:58] <ryanneufeld> what is it you're trying to do?
[14:25:07] <yogurt_truck> graft: omg just put your logic in the callback for the ajax call
[14:25:19] <ryanneufeld> graft: there are browser specific methods to watch the DOM
[14:25:37] <graft> yogurt_truck: then i have to do it in two places, which seems like a bad idea
[14:25:38] <ryanneufeld> graft: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla_event_reference?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=DOM%2FDOM_event_reference
[14:25:53] <ryanneufeld> graft: or, you make one function that does it in one place
[14:25:56] <ryanneufeld> and call it twice
[14:26:07] <ryanneufeld> which is fine
[14:26:22] <Krambiorix> can someone help? http://pastebin.com/T9BQVyqn    when the ajax call should happen, my page gets refreshed...
[14:27:03] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: looks like pastbin is down, can you use another paste service?
[14:27:18] <yogurt_truck> graft: why would you have to do it (whatever it is) "in two places"? what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[14:27:54] <graft> yogurt_truck: when an element with a certain attribute loads, i want to run some javascript, regardless of whether that element was loaded by page load or by ajax
[14:27:59] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: it loaded now, but it seems that you don't understand what AJAX is
[14:28:14] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, how do you mean?
[14:28:26] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: or it's not clear to me what this code is trying to do. How is it being called?
[14:28:37] <ryanneufeld> what is convertToTask()?
[14:28:47] <ryanneufeld> there is not enough information here to answer your question
[14:29:11] <SteveC> systemfault: in XHTML, <img></img> and <img/> are analogous - both are stripped out by adding using .append()
[14:29:24] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, it's just a test. When the ajax call would work i want to pass the result to convertToTask() -> not implemented yet...
[14:29:29] <yogurt_truck> graft: forget the "when an attribute loads" details, and describe your goal in a big picture, implementation-agnostic, way
[14:29:50] <systemfault> SteveC: I don't understand what you mean by stripped out.. how do you know it did that?
[14:29:51] <SteveC> systemfault: I take your point about xhtml though - it just happens to be the default in Visual Studio :)
[14:30:03] <SteveC> systemfault: I've looked at the dom after it's rendered.
[14:30:10] <systemfault> SteveC: ...
[14:30:18] <systemfault> SteveC: With the DOM inspector?
[14:30:30] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: well, the convertToTask might get called before the ajax is done
[14:31:21] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, well, if i comment the call to convertToTask, the page reloads anyway
[14:31:21] <systemfault> SteveC: The browser doesn't care about the markup, it parses it once then it creates a treeâ¦ What you see in the DOM inspector is just a view of how that tree is represented.
[14:31:36] <SteveC> systemfault: using dev tools in IE and chrome (F12)
[14:31:41] <graft> yogurt_truck: not sure how much more agnostic i can get. i just want to run some javascript on a elements matching a particular selector, as soon as those elements are loaded
[14:31:51] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: well, I can't tell you why that is happening with the bit of code you've shared with us
[14:32:30] <ryanneufeld> graft: do you know when those elements are added?
[14:32:38] <ryanneufeld> graft: anywhere in your application?
[14:32:51] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: how is this code being called? What is triggering it?
[14:32:59] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, on page load
[14:33:25] <ryanneufeld> so, on page load this code executes and a page change happens?
[14:33:28] <SteveC> OK, another question then.  I've got a div.  Using Jquery I add overflow: hidden, add a <span></span> to it and then put a heap of <img>s into the span.  Although the vertical does seem to be hidden, the horizontal doesn't - is that a bug?
[14:33:54] <ryanneufeld> SteveC: depends on the css on the page
[14:34:03] <graft> ryanneufeld: yes, i understand perfectly how to solve this by invoking the same function twice, once in an ajax callback and once in $(document).ready. i want to know if there is a way to do this that does not require that duplication
[14:34:19] <ryanneufeld> SteveC: also, did you set a height on that div?
[14:34:26] <ryanneufeld> SteveC: I mean width
[14:34:30] <SteveC> ryanneufeld: yes, the height is pre-set in the HTML
[14:34:35] <ryanneufeld> SteveC: you need both to be set
[14:34:46] <ryanneufeld> or overflow is meaningless for the dimension that doesn't have one set
[14:34:50] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, ow ok: on page load, every .message (row) is bound to a contextmenu. When the user right clicks on the message row, a contextmenu opens. When the user clicks on the menu item CONVERT -> the ajax call would be executed
[14:34:58] <SteveC> ryanneufeld: yes, height and width of hte div is set in the html (and there is space for it in the parent div)
[14:35:15] <ryanneufeld> graft: Okay, I think you've been told that no one here currently knows of a way to do that
[14:35:38] <ryanneufeld> graft: now, I did link you to the MDN docs, and explained that you can watch the DOM
[14:35:54] <ryanneufeld> but I will warn you, it's expensive (read slow) and not cross browser
[14:36:12] <graft> ryanneufeld: yeah seems so. have you ever used the livequery plugin?
[14:36:13] <ryanneufeld> graft: There is no way with jquery to do the specific thing you're wanting to do.
[14:36:20] <ryanneufeld> graft: I have not
[14:36:34] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: AH, so it's a right click~
[14:36:58] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, yes
[14:37:02] <ryanneufeld> ?api stopPropigation @Krambiorix
[14:37:05] <bot-t> Krambiorix, event.stopPropagation() - This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[14:37:11] <ryanneufeld> That should help
[14:37:27] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, yes, but how do i get the event object?
[14:37:47] <ryanneufeld> it's passed into the handler
[14:37:47] <Puck6633> Hello, does anyone know of a plugin or code snippet to perform the same function as slideDown() on a hidden element, only from the center instead of the top? (i.e. the element grows both up and down until it's back to its original size)
[14:38:15] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure what plugin you're using Krambiorix, but typically on click handlers it's the first argument
[14:38:29] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/demo.html
[14:38:30] <ryanneufeld> ?api animate @Puck6633
[14:38:31] <bot-t> Puck6633, .animate() - Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:39:28] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: sorry, I'm out of ideas
[14:39:39] <Puck6633> Let me be more specific then, how do I know what size to animate to if I need to start at 0?
[14:40:08] <Puck6633> Assuming I'm using the css height property. Or is that not how slideDown works?
[14:40:19] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, can i just add the event here at the first param? callback: function(event, key, options) {
[14:40:37] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: no
[14:41:01] <ryanneufeld> it doesn't work that way
[14:41:04] <ryanneufeld> i'm afk
[14:42:30] <Puck6633> A quick test tells me that the slide functions do indeed use height and overflow: hidden, so I feel like I'm on the right track, but I don't really want to have to go digging in the jQuery source for something so seemingly straightforward... :\
[14:50:22] <unblockgames> hi all
[14:50:53] <unblockgames> for some reason i keep getting an error. it says call to undefined function but i have defined the function right above
[14:52:05] <unblockgames> http://pastebin.com/v2MWa7xW
[14:52:15] <unblockgames> the getHome function calls the getImg function
[14:52:20] <unblockgames> but for some reason i get error
[14:52:42] <tw2113> that looks like php more than jquery unblockgames
[14:53:58] <MacDada> hi, how do I insert a new element into two places? Something like: var el = $('<span>click</span>').click(callback); el.insertBefore(container1); el.insertBefore(container2);
[14:55:07] <MacDada> nvm, found $.clone
[15:07:46] <sanduzthree> is this correct for retrieving a list of all elements of a class: $(".classname")
[15:07:46] <Krambiorix> can someone help? http://pastebin.com/T9BQVyqn    when the ajax call should happen, my page gets refreshed...
[15:09:16] <SteveC> Right - so pastebin of my problem http://pastebin.com/FRcsefuJ - It's starting with an outer div, then setting the overflow to hidden and filling it with a spam filled with <img>s - the horizontal "hidden" fails..  Any idea why?
[15:12:10] <sanduzthree> for some reason jquery is not selecting dynamically created classes but is able to select classes that were written statically in the php file. any idea what could be the problem?
[15:12:15] <SteveC> ryanneufeld: http://pastebin.com/FRcsefuJ - example of my earlier query.
[15:25:07] <lucenut> Hey guys. I am getting the value of a textarea to submit via ajax like this $('#notes_' + voterID).val()'But when I try the same with a radio button I get just the value of the first option, not the checked option. $('#party_' + voterID).val().
[15:25:13] <SteveC> OK, another question - when I look at $("body").html, it's got escaped quote marks - can I just dump that back into a html and it unescapes?
[15:25:30] <lucenut> But when I tried "checked" I get a js error. $('#party_' + voterID).checked.val()
[15:26:36] <SteveC> $('input[name=radioName]:checked', '#myForm').val()
[15:27:12] <lucenut> Gracias, lemme try that.
[15:28:54] <sanduzthree> for some reason jquery is not selecting dynamically created classes even though they show up in the source. any idea what could be the problem?
[15:29:53] <rmurphey> sanduzthree: are you selecting them after they are added?
[15:30:01] <anew> what are 'chained calls' ?
[15:30:06] <sanduzthree> rmurphey: yes
[15:30:21] <sanduzthree> rmurphey: im doing it through the console and it simply wont grab them
[15:30:31] <rmurphey> sanduzthree: can you show a demo of the problem?
[15:31:10] <sanduzthree> rmurphey: one sec leme see if i can
[15:33:01] <lucenut> SteveC, still having trouble. $('input[name=party_' + voterID]:checked', '#myForm').val()
[15:33:02] <SteveC> I bet you're missing hte # in your selector :)
[15:33:30] <SteveC> lucenut: that example is missing at least one ' mark, and possibly more.
[15:33:35] <lucenut> The voterID is a var passed into the function.
[15:33:44] <rmurphey> sanduzthree: what does your selector look like, and what is the element you're tyring to select?
[15:33:52] <SteveC> lucenut: in that case, it's missing + ' after the voterID
[15:33:59] <lucenut> The input name/id is party_38 or whatever id.
[15:34:05] <lucenut> OK
[15:34:11] <sanduzthree> rmurphey: $(".CountryName")
[15:34:37] <sanduzthree> its an element with the class="CountryName"
[15:34:56] <rmurphey> and when you do $('.CountryName').length in the console, you get 0?
[15:34:57] <sanduzthree> it works when i do it to statically generated classes
[15:35:09] <SteveC> sanduzthree: sure the html is valid?
[15:35:11] <sanduzthree> yes
[15:35:18] <sanduzthree> SteveC: ill check one sec
[15:35:21] <rmurphey> sanduzthree: without a demo we can't really help
[15:35:24] <SteveC> can you put it on pastebin or something?
[15:35:32] <SteveC> (the html)
[15:36:02] <lucenut> OK, I'm getting close Steve. Now I'm getting "undefined" instead of the value for party.
[15:36:08] <sanduzthree> looks like my html has tons of errors, let me clean these up first then ill try again
[15:36:20] <SteveC> lucenut: can you put your code on pastebin or something?  Hard to debug excerpts.
[15:36:21] <marcoslhc> anew chained call is whe you call several functions over an object, lile $(".someobj").find("somechild").addClass("someclass")
[15:36:32] <SteveC> sanduzthree: that selector should be fine once the HTML is somewhat valid.
[15:36:43] <sanduzthree> thanks
[15:38:32] <marcoslhc> anew: more technical explanation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining#jQuery
[15:39:04] <SteveC> I hate that notation, just create an object :)
[15:40:36] <SteveC> So, anyone have any idea why some HTML generated by jquery would wrap images within a overflow:hidden div but the same html hides the excess images?
[15:41:42] <lucenut> Here SteveC: http://pastebin.com/NpvP0DiD
[15:43:58] <SteveC> lucenut: umm, those functions aren't being called by anything.  BUT, going back to your earlier comment - where's voterID coming from?
[15:44:26] <SteveC> are you sure it's got a value when it's called?
[15:45:47] <lucenut> Yeah, it's in a large coldfusion report. I spared you most of the nonsense.
[15:46:11] <lucenut> The votersID is shaking out fine in the notes_ field.
[15:47:13] <SteveC> ok...  Umm, maybe just $('input[name=party_'+voterID+']:checked') then?
[15:47:44] <anew> marcoslhc sorry i should have been more specific... chain calls in backbone and the necessity to use return this; in views.
[15:52:01] <lucenut> Boom! That worked Steve. Thanks a bunch.
[15:52:09] <SteveC> np
[15:52:27] <marcoslhc> anew: well is somehow related. You need to return this to reuse the object in subsequent calls over the same object.
[15:52:31] <lucenut> I'll have to chew on it awhile to understand it. :-)
[15:54:50] <Krambiorix> SteveC, can you help me with my right click menu?  http://pastebin.com/T9BQVyqn    when the user clicks a menu option in the right click menu, an ajax call should happen, my page gets refreshed...
[15:55:01] <anew> marcoslhc it's not automatic ?
[15:58:22] <marcoslhc> anew: No, is no automatic. All functions chainables return the object they've recived, when you define a function and want to enable the continuous chain calls you must return this.
[15:58:31] <SteveC> Krambiorix: Not used hte context menu before, but a submit must be being triggered - have y ou stepped through the code to see where it's happening?  maybe return false on the function?
[15:58:40] <SteveC> just grasping there really though.
[15:59:48] <Krambiorix> SteveC, the refresh happens when calling the ajax request
[16:01:45] <SteveC> so it doesn't get to "convertToTask(id) ?
[16:01:53] <Krambiorix> SteveC, nope, it doesn't
[16:02:28] <SteveC> hurm, dunno - sorry.   I'd read the context menu docs and compare them with what  you have.
[16:03:10] <Krambiorix> SteveC okay thanks
[16:08:22] <sopparus> anyone know of a javascript that makes it possible to have something like android contact list? to list stuff with a-z on the right
[16:08:28] <sopparus> with html, not an app
[16:13:23] <sekyms> I am having some issues with .animate and was wondering if someone could take a look
[16:13:27] <sekyms> http://jsfiddle.net/FBkQc/
[16:13:48] <sekyms> If you hit the forward arrow and wait for the boxes to load, then hit the backwards button you get some odd behavior
[16:14:07] <sekyms> and I'm not sure what is going on exactly
[16:19:12] <Doxin> how does one get the value from an input field? doing $("#blah").val() always seems to return the empty string. what gives?
[16:20:19] <coldhead> val() is the right way to do it
[16:20:26] <coldhead> are you sure your selector is correct?
[16:20:37] <smykes> Hrm dont know why I have so many issues with irc from home
[16:20:37] <coldhead> you don't have duplicate IDs or something?
[16:21:09] <Doxin> coldhead: let me check duplicate ids
[16:21:29] <Doxin> coldhead: only element using that id.
[16:21:59] <SteveC> Well, day #1 of my new site and I'mÂ£1.02 richer
[16:22:36] <coldhead> Doxin: http://jsfiddle.net/y5rKh/
[16:22:46] <coldhead> great work SteveC~
[16:22:55] <SteveC> Been ages since I've used adsense - still as bizzarely generous - tell facebook friends about a site, get money :)
[16:23:23] <SteveC> Pity it's not really fully working because I can't get jquery to behave..  or maybe html...
[16:24:00] <Doxin> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/9qMGS/
[16:24:52] <Doxin> coldhead: it seems to use the value from the html source, not the value the user enters
[16:26:26] <Doxin> 0.9999...=1
[16:28:12] <coldhead> what's all this... onkeypress= stuff
[16:28:59] <Doxin> coldhead: the templating engine will murder you and all your relatives if you use jquery to attach events.
[16:29:23] <Doxin> coldhead: alternatively, everything will have duplicate events after the first page nav change.
[16:29:27] <danheberden> what kind of communist template engine are you using?
[16:29:47] <Doxin> danheberden: mustache
[16:29:55] <hateIE> how comes the content that i... $("#fixed_position_pager").append   does not apear visible.. its there but its like its out of the viewable area
[16:29:56] <danheberden> and have you introduced it to event delegation? it's like democracy
[16:30:16] <marcoslhc> danheberden: define comunist
[16:30:21] <Doxin> danheberden: the problem is that it injects the element after I add the events, if I swap it around you might add an event twice.
[16:30:39] <danheberden> Doxin: i'll leave the explanations to coldhead
[16:30:42] <tw2113> danheberden, i had to quote you in anonymous "OH:" style on twitter
[16:30:43] <shoky> Doxin: template_search is part of the DOM, and you're cloning it into another part of the DOM
[16:30:43] <danheberden> marcoslhc: see above
[16:30:55] <shoky> Doxin: so you DO have two elements with the same id
[16:30:59] <danheberden> tw2113 lnk plx
[16:31:02] <danheberden> *plz
[16:31:05] <Doxin> shoky: no, I dont
[16:31:06] <shoky> Doxin: try  $('[id=mainsearch]')
[16:31:12] <shoky> Doxin: yes, you do.
[16:31:17] <tw2113> https://twitter.com/tw2113/status/285543395110289408
[16:31:17] <Doxin> wait
[16:31:19] <Doxin> fudge
[16:31:21] <Doxin> I do.
[16:31:21] <b-ot> tw2113, @tw2113: OH "what kind of communist template engine are you using?"
[16:31:23] <danheberden> also why do i not follow you
[16:31:26] <Doxin> shoky: thanks for that :P
[16:31:31] <raj> is $.getScript considerably slower than to just run a function?
[16:31:35] <danheberden> tw2113: <3z
[16:31:37] <raj> from a loaded script
[16:31:43] <tw2113> no idea why you don't do the follow
[16:32:17] <coldhead> tw2113 tweets a lot about PHP is why, danheberden
[16:32:30] <tw2113> more specifically WordPress
[16:32:41] <raj> oh yeah, the guy with the nodes
[16:32:45] <coldhead> so many memories
[16:33:06] <tw2113> nightmares for some
[16:33:21] <coldhead> raj: it's slower in that it has to uh get the Script
[16:33:24] <shoky> derp.. what's OH :(
[16:33:32] <tw2113> "overheard" shoky
[16:33:39] <shoky> ah
[16:33:41] <danheberden> coldhead: shit
[16:33:41] <coldhead> OHIO
[16:33:43] <shoky> never heard that before
[16:33:46] <raj> sup sup shoky
[16:34:03] <shoky> kz raj, chillin''
[16:34:05] <shoky> sups
[16:34:16] <danheberden> i tried php once, but ran into problems with `node myScript.php`
[16:34:23] <raj> i have so many kinks that are adding up
[16:34:24] <shoky> lol
[16:34:44] <raj> i'm basically devoting tonight to fixing this shit before getting back to the project
[16:35:04] <shoky> this shit !== the project?
[16:36:00] <raj> yeah, but like retarded crap like sometimes the js/jq don't seem to alter a DOM element
[16:36:22] <shoky> hmpf
[16:36:35] <tw2113> danheberden, i feel honored to be among such a small group of people you follow
[16:37:30] <danheberden> tw2113: well, i had to kick coldhead off
[16:37:37] <danheberden> to keep it at a fixed number
[16:37:46] <tw2113> he'll live
[16:37:49] <raj> I load the content into the DOM using $.ajax({'url':'/myurl'}), and put it into the DOM in the 'success' function; then I load the necessary .js with $.getScript()
[16:38:17] <tw2113> danheberden, tell coldhead he can be followed again once he admits to the lie about his first day, and that he finally moved onto his second day
[16:38:39] <danheberden> for a day to us is but a thousand to coldhead
[16:38:52] <danheberden> "and on the first day, he learned jQuery. And he saw that it was good."
[16:39:12] <hateIE> http://jsfiddle.net/SjnxA/
[16:39:13] <danheberden> so this chick on a dating app just said "is that your real name?"
[16:39:14] <coldhead> i can't believe my own partner attacked me
[16:39:17] <danheberden> like i'd make up "dan heberden"
[16:39:19] <danheberden> jesus christ
[16:39:30] <raj> actually, then it's not $.getScript that's slow
[16:39:41] <coldhead> it DOES sound like your porn star name, danheberden
[16:39:57] <raj> it's placing the $.ajax-loaded content into the DOM
[16:40:02] <shoky> raj why you still loading scripts at runtime, when you dont have any real need for it
[16:40:17] <raj> well, those links up top are dynamic
[16:40:20] <tw2113> I stand by this thought danheberden "If drinking coffee/beer and pissing sarcasm was a career option, I'd be close to CEO"
[16:40:29] <raj> as in, they don't cause a page refresh
[16:40:36] <shoky> raj but they're all to your site, with your scripts
[16:40:44] <raj> they just load the content into the .content
[16:40:54] <raj> yeah, I should organize it better
[16:41:00] <shoky> i meant, load all scripts on load.
[16:41:01] <raj> maybe that'll solve some of these issues
[16:41:19] <raj> although I feel like the scripts loading faster isn't the issue since the DOM isn't being acted upon by the JS
[16:41:28] <raj> if the JS was loaded slowly, it should work
[16:41:43] <danheberden> tw2113: a good sentiment
[16:41:55] <raj> am I wrong?
[16:42:14] <shoky> raj hearing you talk about some slowness that you're not really sure about.. is kinda hard to work with ;p
[16:42:25] <raj> oh, right :)
[16:42:31] <tw2113> man, if i knew js better and didn't already have a decent job, I'd want to work at @bocoup
[16:42:54] <shoky> all the cool kids are there
[16:43:06] <ryanneufeld> seems to be the case
[16:43:27] <coldhead> most of the bocoup employees are from broken homes and circus families
[16:43:34] <coldhead> it's more of a sheltered workshop
[16:43:41] <shoky> :)
[16:43:55] <tw2113> must?.not?."OH" tweet that?.
[16:44:09] <shoky> eh, twitter.
[16:44:31] <tw2113> where do I get one of those yellow "js" stickers?
[16:44:36] <shoky> eh, .. world, must, know, that im cool because i think this quote is cool.
[16:45:27] <tw2113> keep it straight js so i can dabble in any that I see fit. Instead of 1 specific library
[16:45:30] <raj> lol
[16:45:38] <coldhead> at your local jsconf event, tw2113
[16:46:11] <tw2113> but i live in the behind crawlspace of the US. The upper Midwest
[16:46:22] <coldhead> get your ass to florida then
[16:46:43] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: WA or OR?
[16:46:44] <tw2113> :P
[16:46:50] <tw2113> South Dakota
[16:47:04] <ryanneufeld> I'm so sorry
[16:47:06] <shoky> wow.
[16:47:17] <tw2113> D:
[16:47:28] <vladikoff> :D
[16:48:11] <tw2113> i'd consider appendTo if not bocoup
[16:48:30] <abstractmedia> HallÃ¶schen
[16:48:36] <abstractmedia> ^^
[16:48:41] <abstractmedia> deutsch oder englisch hier?
[16:49:13] <SteveC> English
[16:49:37] <abstractmedia> Ok
[16:49:54] <abstractmedia> i have a problem with the draggable an a navigation on an aside tag
[16:50:30] <abstractmedia> after drag out the aside tag, my item is no more show
[16:50:43] <abstractmedia> after delete the aside tag, it works greate
[16:50:47] <shoky> ?demo @ abstractmedia
[16:50:47] <bot-t> abstractmedia, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:50:53] <raj> ok, first I'm gonna move this all into loading at docready
[16:50:58] <abstractmedia> ok moment pls
[16:51:02] <raj> then I'll ask questions
[16:51:16] <shoky> raj: the script loading?
[16:51:19] <raj> yeah
[16:51:25] <shoky> raj: what's wrong with <script> tags?
[16:51:27] <raj> cuz it's pointless to ask anything till that's fixed
[16:51:37] <raj> yeah, that's what I mean, i'm gonna do that
[16:51:45] <shoky> ah , good;]
[16:51:47] <raj> oh wait
[16:51:51] <raj> that's not what I said though
[16:51:54] <raj> thank you :)
[16:51:56] <shoky> lol
[16:52:47] <tw2113> i suppose i could do http://www.zazzle.com/javascript_stickers-217328179689306760
[17:03:21] <abstractmedia> ok
[17:03:27] <abstractmedia> here my live example
[17:03:27] <abstractmedia> http://5.42.141.209/admin/form/test-formular-1234/config/list
[17:03:42] <abstractmedia> the problem is the left sidebar
[17:05:08] <abstractmedia> left and right items the same
[17:05:15] <abstractmedia> all of this can drag
[17:05:28] <abstractmedia> but left items are hidden out of the box
[17:09:39] <raj> is there some jquery I can't do on hidden elements?
[17:09:58] <raj> width()/height() I suppose
[17:10:07] <ryanneufeld> even that works
[17:10:15] <ryanneufeld> pretty much everything should work
[17:10:24] <ryanneufeld> as long as you can select it
[17:10:28] <raj> k
[17:10:30] <raj> thank you
[17:10:32] <oojacoboo> any reason why the return on the target here wouldn't be working for the input? https://gist.github.com/4416567
[17:11:22] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: what do you get when you console.log(event.target) ?
[17:11:29] <oojacoboo> good Q
[17:11:54] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: the input
[17:12:10] <ryanneufeld> ?api is
[17:12:15] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, jQuery API - Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/
[17:12:26] <ryanneufeld> ?api is()
[17:12:30] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, jQuery API - Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/
[17:12:33] <ryanneufeld> gah
[17:12:48] <oojacoboo> check to see if the element is a match
[17:12:56] <oojacoboo> it works for the anchor and the select
[17:13:00] <oojacoboo> just not working for the input
[17:13:04] <ryanneufeld> http://api.jquery.com/is/ you're using it wrong
[17:13:48] <oojacoboo> need to put it within a callbck?
[17:14:08] <ryanneufeld> no
[17:14:10] <ryanneufeld> read the docs
[17:14:16] <ryanneufeld> how many params does is() accept?
[17:15:00] <ryanneufeld> I'll give you a hint, it's less than two
[17:15:30] <graft> anyone know a good plugin for simple table sorting/resizing?
[17:15:41] <graft> the less it does to the table the better
[17:18:20] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: you can use css
[17:18:23] <oojacoboo> I don't see the issue
[17:18:35] <oojacoboo> from the docsâ¦     } else if ($(this).is(".blue,.red")) {
[17:18:53] <oojacoboo> those are classes, yes, but selectors, comma separated of course
[17:19:12] <ryanneufeld> yes, now compare that to what you have
[17:19:30] <oojacoboo> fml commas ><
[17:19:38] <ryanneufeld> and quotes
[17:19:44] <oojacoboo> that's what I mean
[17:19:46] <ryanneufeld> you passed three things
[17:19:48] <ryanneufeld> not one :)
[17:19:52] <oojacoboo> yea yea
[17:20:11] <oojacoboo> thanks for pointing that out, totally overlooked it
[17:20:17] <ryanneufeld> this can stay between us
[17:20:19] <ryanneufeld> :)
[17:20:21] <oojacoboo> :P
[17:24:32] <tw2113> ryanneufeld, did you just follow me on twitter or have you been for awhile? it says you already follow me there
[17:24:42] <ryanneufeld> ...
[17:24:48] <ryanneufeld> just now
[17:24:49] <ryanneufeld> :)
[17:25:00] <tw2113> gotcha, twitter hasn't notified me yet via email
[17:25:08] <tw2113> so slow!
[17:25:27] <tw2113> i'm going to get my archive download link faster than this
[17:25:49] <Eviltwin> Why don't you guys follow me? :(
[17:26:16] <ryanneufeld> I have been
[17:26:24] <tw2113> just not on twitter :D
[17:26:25] <ryanneufeld> I thought you saw me in the bushes the other day
[17:26:32] <ryanneufeld> apparently not
[17:28:49] <coldhead> is this you http://twitter.com/EvilTwin ?
[17:29:02] <Eviltwin> Nope
[17:29:20] <Eviltwin> I've actually only tweeted 4 times since May
[17:29:26] <coldhead> that may explain the lack of follows
[17:29:30] <tw2113> reasons why we don't follow you #1
[17:29:49] <Eviltwin> But my Facebook usage picked up :)
[17:30:18] <tw2113> what's facebook?
[17:30:25] <coldhead> no doubt
[17:30:42] <tw2113> is that like a book of faces? taken Hannibel Lecter style?
[17:30:46] <coldhead> facebook is a walled garden that will be the death of us all someday soon
[17:31:15] <tw2113> ah so it's the garden of eden where we actually want to eat the forbidden fruit just to escape
[18:21:25] <replicant> anyone used the datatables plugin per chance, and wanted to get the table data to create icanhaz templates (or any template for that matter) to create a non-table looking interface? in other words, i'm basically wanting to make use of datatables data sorting/filtering/paging capabilities but display my data in a custom list view (very m uch not table looking)?
[18:37:54] <kennardconsult> Hi guys. Is there a way to stop jQuery's WidgetFactory method from wrapping 'return this'? It appears to do some magic.
[18:49:50] <kennardconsult> Why does jQuery UI WidgetFactory wrap 'return this'?
[19:03:19] <mouses> is it bad practice for my php to load an empty <img> tag and then have my jquery load the src attribute later?
[19:03:36] <mouses> blank meaning no src attribute
[19:12:41] <mouses> nevermind

[19:41:41] <sheilablackrose> is there a reason besindes making our job miserable?
[19:41:44] <tw2113> because Microsoft still thinks its a decent browser
[19:41:58] <tw2113> why does Apple keep Safari around?
[19:42:10] <sheilablackrose> apple doesnt like to share

[20:57:29] <michaelespinosa> I'm trying to put together a quick paypal form  and need a little help. You can't send paypal anything with the quantity of '0'. So I'm basically trying to check all the items that have a quantity of 0 and disable them. Any help is appreciated. You can see what I've tried here - http://jsbin.com/uqupir/2/
[20:57:59] <zx1> so we have been asked to write a custom UI for mobile platforms
[20:58:32] <ctttt> anyone in here>
[20:59:30] <tw2113> so?do what was requested?
[21:00:59] <tw2113> ctttt, i got the map to show up fine in jsbin.com
[21:01:17] <tw2113> copy pasted all of the html markup on the right column of mapbox.com's link
[21:03:12] <ctttt> tw2113 it's not working when I paste it in
[21:03:59] <ctttt> I need it to work in this http://pastebin.com/BjcdLQY6
[21:04:21] <ctttt> I've attempted to paste   // .markers() gives a list of markers, along with their elements attached. down
[21:06:50] <tw2113> so you're pasting the entilre <html> markup into that spot?
[21:09:56] <ctttt> @ tw2113
[21:10:03] <ctttt> I got it to work no pinscount.com
[21:10:12] <ctttt> However, it is excluding several of the markers
[21:15:37] <ctttt> here is the modified code tw2113
[21:15:38] <ctttt> http://pastebin.com/z39JniVh
[21:16:02] <ctttt> I don't know why it isn't displaying the remainder of the markers in view
[21:17:53] <tw2113> console errors?
[21:21:07] <tw2113> dunno
[21:21:19] <tw2113> i'd have to go over it carefully to figure out myself
[21:22:02] <tw2113> only mapping library i'm familiar with at all is leaflet.js
[21:24:03] <Skaag> is there a friendly UI tool to produce jQuery interfaces?
[21:28:24] <ctttt> sad day
[21:35:58] <imsky> oh don piano
[21:39:50] <ctttt> anyone know where the problem point is?
[21:45:11] <tw2113> my best suggestion at this point is paste it in piece by piece
[21:45:18] <tw2113> and try to understand what each piece is doing
[21:46:45] <ctttt> I'm sure it is this peice         inextent = [],
[21:46:54] <ctttt> but I don't know what to change it to
[21:47:11] <tw2113> so an empty array declaration?
[21:48:19] <ctttt> yes?
[21:49:05] <ctttt> it is to test of the markers exist on the map
[21:49:17] <ctttt> I don't know why it is not returning markers that have been added
[22:35:14] <aqeel> hi everyone
[22:35:49] <aqeel> what is the best practice of creating a toggle
[22:36:27] <aqeel> should i use class and toggle it or any other better way
[22:39:45] <r00723r0> aqeel: that works.
[22:40:32] <aqeel> but if in plugin i use the class, and somehow if the user uses the same class...that will conflict
[22:41:42] <aqeel> or may be i error out if the user is using same class and to have it renamed
[23:05:47] <shesek> aqeel, most people just prefix their stuff that sits in the same namespace as other things, and hope no one else would use the same prefix
[23:07:03] <aqeel> thanks... i would like to create a fail safe plugin... so people can know what is wrong, and or why it is not working
[23:09:52] <shesek> aqeel, if its only meant to work on newer browsers, 067wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
[23:10:05] <shesek> sorry, my cat walked on my keyboard :)
[23:10:22] <shesek> aqeel, if its only meant to work on newer browsers, you could also consider to use a custom data property instead
[23:10:40] <shesek> <div data-aqeel-class="foobar">
[23:10:48] <shesek> div[data-aqeel-class="foobar"]
[23:10:59] <shesek> (as a CSS selector)
[23:11:16] <shesek> well, CSS/jQuery selector
[23:12:09] <aqeel> aha.... so i simply assign it with jquery and manipulate it...
[23:12:16] <aqeel> nice one
[23:14:05] <shesek> it won't work on older browsers, but when writing browser-specific plugins you have the privilege of not caring about that
[23:14:31] <aqeel> but if it could have a support is positive point
[23:14:56] <aqeel> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6266559/jQuery.plugins/Demo.aautoscroll.htm
[23:15:08] <aqeel> i am adding quite a few more mfeatures...
[23:15:09] <shesek> oh, you meant a jQuery plugin
[23:15:19] <shesek> I thought you meant browser plugin, dunno why
[23:15:48] <aqeel> well yup jquery plugin
[23:15:49] <shesek> well - it'll work as a jQuery selector on all browsers (via Sizzle), but not as a CSS selector
[23:15:52] <aqeel> not mine though
[23:16:27] <shesek> tho, technically, someone could use "data-aqeel-class" as an attribute
[23:16:43] <shesek> its not much different than just using class="aqeel-foobar"
[23:16:53] <aqeel> so what is the best approach
[23:17:03] <shesek> just pick something that's unlikely to be used by someone else, preferably prefixed with the plugin's name
[23:17:13] <shesek> let me see what you're doing exactly
[23:17:32] <shesek> where do you need to use a class?
[23:17:46] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/js/plugins/aautoscroll.js
[23:18:00] <aqeel> for toggling the edgescroll: method
[23:18:59] <aqeel> i have added toend and edgescroll methods... removed all dependencies as stated in original site, made it to be jslint clean'
[23:19:05] <shesek> so you want to store the current state of edgescroll, whether its enabled or not?
[23:19:18] <aqeel> yup....
[23:19:30] <shesek> why not use the data() method than?
[23:19:39] <aqeel> and have it toggled if on do what i is there else simply do what plugin does
[23:20:00] <shesek> some_jquery_object.data('edgescroll_enabled', true)
[23:20:23] <shesek> some_jquery_object.data('edgescroll_enabled') // returns the value you set, or null when its not set at all
[23:21:00] <aqeel> so i create a toggle on data
[23:21:07] <aqeel> or if else it on data
[23:21:23] <shesek> if (some_jquery_object.data('edgescroll_enabled')) { some_jquery_object.data('edgescroll_enabled', false); /* toggle it off */ }
[23:21:30] <shesek> else { some_jquery_object.data('edgescroll_enabled', true); /* toggle it on */ }
[23:22:17] <aqeel> but how will the data know which state it is on...
[23:23:14] <shesek> aqeel, well, you'll have to set it yourself when you're enabling/disabling it, as I demonstrated above
[23:23:29] <aqeel> thanaks..
[23:23:33] <aqeel> thanks*
[23:23:41] <aqeel> working on it now
[23:50:01] <vaibhavjain> Can I alter the Data recieved after we do an ajax call, before it is send to ajax->success
