[06:55:47] <RandomSerb> what am I doing wrong here - https://jsfiddle.net/themilossh/ba5w7dc0/ ? I'm trying to set the lowest select pick only the items that are not selected already
[09:37:06] <sian> hi'
[09:55:54] <sian> https://pastebin.com/raw/S0RRwE7i
[09:56:00] <sian> why second function doesn'twork?
[10:01:23] <Woet> sian: because when the code is ran, .expand doesn't exist yet.
[10:01:31] <Woet> sian: you can just bind to the element once and handle both cases inside it.
[10:01:40] <Woet> sian: look at one of the countless "show/hide" examples
[10:02:04] <sian> well
[10:02:18] <sian> I clicked on the collapsed class it got changed to expand though
[10:06:46] <sian> @Woet thanks
[10:07:01] <Woet> sian: yes, because when the code is ran, .collapsed does exist.
[10:07:36] <sian> yeah but it was changed to expand though when I inspect xD
[10:07:42] <sian> I kinda get it though

[12:05:33] <tigermousr21> After the acquisition by Private Internet Access, Freenode is now being used to push ICO scams https://www.coindesk.com/handshake-revealed-vcs-back-plan-to-give-away-100-million-in-crypto/
[12:05:37] <tigermousr21> "All told, Handshake aims to give $250 worth of its tokens to *each* user of the websites the company has partnerships with – GitHub, the P2P Foundation and *FREENODE*, a chat channel for peer-to-peer projects. As such, developers who have existing accounts on each could receive up to $750 worth of Handshake tokens."
[12:05:37] <tigermousr21> Handshake cryptocurrency scam is operated by Andrew Lee (276-88-0536), the fraudster in chief at Private Internet Access which now owns Freenode
[12:05:42] <tigermousr21> Freenode is registered as a "private company limited by guarantee without share capital" performing "activities of other membership organisations not elsewhere classified", with Christel and Andrew Lee (PIA's founder) as officers, and Andrew Lee having the majority of voting rights
[12:05:45] <tigermousr21> Even christel, the freenode head of staff is actively peddling this scam https://twitter.com/christel/status/1025089889090654208
[12:05:49] <tigermousr21> Don't support freenode and their ICO scam, switch to a network that hasn't been co-opted by corporate interests. OFTC or efnet might be a good choice. Perhaps even https://matrix.org/

[15:45:51] <unomystEz> when I update a component via .html() it seems whatever was selected dissappears
[15:45:58] <unomystEz> is there any way to mitigate that?
[21:32:51] <ZeroWalker> if you want to create a listbox with columns, is jquery the way to go, or does html support it directly. Been searching and can't really find anything useful
