[05:38:32] <MOUD> Hey all.
[05:40:03] <thedonut> co
[05:40:51] <thedonut> Morning all, I was wondering if anyone can help with something (seemingly) simple? I want to run through a series of table rows, get the data out of each and refactor into my desired article/markup - ala https://jsfiddle.net/mgLm7awf/4/
[05:41:42] <MOUD> I have a form with 2 submit buttons, each button will get all the information from the form and perform a different task using Ajax. How can I do it? Here's a sample of the form. https://jsfiddle.net/17x6mpmx/
[05:54:39] <AdamPDotty> MOUD: First try something yourself! Once you get stuck we would be glad to help you out.
[05:55:26] <MOUD> AdamPDotty, ok
[05:58:09] <AdamPDotty> thedonut: looks like a good approach, but couldyou clarify, what you want to achieve?
[05:59:36] <thedonut> AdamPDotty: I have a table full of rows with product data (sku, name, image etc) but I want to use a different markup as the table is not only messy but impossible to style so I want to move each product into it's on <article> instead of <tr> so I want to get the data I need out of each table row and create an <article> with it and then destroy the table at the end
[06:46:10] <MOUD> I have updated my link. How do I know that it's working, and how do I know what information is being sent before it's being sent? https://jsfiddle.net/17x6mpmx/1/
[06:55:31] <AdamPDotty> MOUD: You should use form.on('Submit') instead of document.on('click') and you should prevent standard submitting (event.preventDefault())
[06:55:49] <AdamPDotty> then it could already work
[06:56:10] <MOUD> AdamPDotty, OK, I'll give a try, thanks.
[07:25:49] <AdamPDotty> thedonut: Tried something, maybe it helps: https://jsfiddle.net/mgLm7awf/5/
[07:48:31] <thedonut> AdamPDotty: That put me on the right path to get it working, thank you very much.

[10:18:06] <linuxkiller> hello, how can I modify the background value of elt:after using jquery ?
[10:20:19] <stennowork> linuxkiller, https://www.google.de/search?q=jquery+select+pseudoelement
[10:41:43] <Darren_> http://ankitdesigns.com/demo/gsid/our-products/sample-product/ can someone help tell me if this is a js issue or css issue, under my carousel, there's supposed to be a second carousel synced with the first, the second is meant to be thumbnails, however it doesnt display, it's the empty gap below. I cant tell if its css causing it to be blank or something in the js
[10:42:29] <svss> hello
[11:39:16] <ezio> Hello, you've reached #jquery, how may I direct your call?
[11:41:10] <stennowork> hello this is dog
[11:42:16] <linuxkiller> How to append the style under head tag with jquery ?
[11:46:15] <taplar> what do you mean 'under' ?
[11:47:57] <stennowork> i guess a <style> in the <head>
[11:48:35] <taplar> or he can tell us what he means exactly, :)
[11:49:57] <svss> hello
[11:50:09] <svss> how can I redirect to a website with post request?
[11:50:15] <svss> is there a way with js?
[11:50:43] <ezio> svss, with a post request?
[11:50:50] <stennowork> depends on the response
[11:51:29] <svss> yep
[11:51:34] <MikeD_> i know browsers used to ask "the server you were sending data to is telling me to send your info somewhere else, you good with that?"  idk if that's still true, but it should be
[11:51:40] <svss> it's an online shop
[11:52:02] <taplar> the post should be able to return with a redirect response
[11:52:04] <stennowork> svss, make your server reply with 300
[11:52:11] <stennowork> 301 or so?
[11:52:19] <taplar> ya, something like that
[11:52:25] <taplar> quick google should turn something up
[11:52:33] <MikeD_> i don't think you want to tell the browser "I've permanently moved to this new location"
[11:52:35] <svss> basically user order a product, after order is done in my website I want to auto redirect to payment website
[11:52:50] <stennowork> 302 then
[11:53:06] <stennowork> or 307
[11:53:24] <svss> hmm
[11:53:28] <svss> not sure how though
[11:53:50] <MikeD_> wouldn't it be better to have a response page show you "Ok, i got that... now click here to pay for it" ?
[11:53:52] <taplar> what's your backend?  google that language and redirects to find more info
[11:53:59] <svss> php :P
[11:54:06] <svss> but I found its not possible
[11:54:14] <taplar> so "php, return redirect response" or something
[11:54:22] <taplar> or hit up ##php
[11:54:33] <svss> MikeD_:  I want to make it easier for users
[11:54:39] <svss> One click and done
[11:54:42] <svss> then just pay
[11:55:30] <MikeD_> i'd still have a response page confirm that the order was placed, then have the local/in-browser javascript automagically go to the new url
[11:56:15] <MikeD_> do you plan on contacting those who abandon their transaction when they see what you want them to spend?
[11:56:37] <svss> it already have a price tag
[11:56:44] <svss> if they abandon its their choice
[11:56:50] <MikeD_> we spent a crap-ton of time reclaiming people who didn't finish the deal
[11:56:52] <stennowork> def. not a javascript problem :D
[11:57:05] <MikeD_> yeah, it's an ecommerce problem
[11:57:30] <svss> well, this isnt an ecommerce platform
[11:57:37] <svss> but have a shop in it
[11:57:55] <MikeD_> if you want my money, it's commerce, innit?
[11:57:57] <taplar> i would, again, suggest googling or asking around in ##php for your specific question
[11:58:10] <svss> MikeD_:  can javascript redirect with post request?
[11:58:20] <MikeD_> no
[11:58:26] <svss> "i'd still have a response page confirm that the order was placed, then have the local/in-browser javascript automagically go to the new url "
[11:58:44] <MikeD_> javascript can do location = mynewurl
[11:58:54] <svss> ah but the request is with post
[11:59:15] <MikeD_> and php outputs a page in response
[12:00:00] <taplar> *can
[12:00:24] <svss> hmm, so its not what i'm looking for then
[12:00:24] <stennowork> window.location.href = "the new url";
[12:00:38] <svss> because request is post
[12:00:42] <MikeD_> yeah, or it can redirect... but that might freak out a security warning about redirected post
[12:00:43] <svss> it needs to be post
[12:00:55] <taplar> you're stuck on the post, svss
[12:01:00] <stennowork> request type doesn't enter into it
[12:01:07] <stennowork> doesn't matter if its post or get or w/e
[12:01:11] <taplar> the post can happen, return a page, at which point that page returned would do the javascript location stuff
[12:01:11] <MikeD_> or you could ajax post the data and in the handler of that, just go to another url
[12:01:40] <taplar> but if it is a business requirement that the redirect happen as part of that post request, that is a php issue
[12:02:13] <stennowork> would be the most clean way in any case too
[12:02:15] <MikeD_> yup - taplar is correct
[12:02:20] <stennowork> just return a 30*
[12:02:35] <stennowork> 30x
[12:02:57] <MikeD_> https://www.google.com/#q=redirect+warning+on+post+request
[12:26:51] <catbadger> hello all
[12:34:33] <SpecialTech> Is there a way to select the homepage + params if there is any using window.location.href.indexOf("")
[13:06:31] <SpecialTech> nvm
[14:15:41] <MaxLeiter> how should I submit all $("form[target='self']")?
[14:15:55] <robertmaxrees> wat\
[14:15:56] <MaxLeiter> how should I submit all $("form[target='self']").each(function(i, e) { $(e).submit() }); only submits one
[14:16:03] <MaxLeiter> *
[14:16:11] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle so we can get more context?
[14:16:18] <MaxLeiter> yeah
[14:16:20] <MaxLeiter> 1 sec
[14:16:59] <taplar> iirc, doesn't submitting a from cancel previous form submits?
[14:17:08] <MaxLeiter> I copied wrong snippet
[14:17:17] <MaxLeiter> taplar: this page has hundreds of forms, and I'm trying to automate the clicking
[14:17:17] <robertmaxrees> MaxLeiter are are these handled by AJAX or...?
[14:19:11] <MaxLeiter> robertmaxrees: no clue
[14:19:20] <MaxLeiter> they look like this
[14:19:24] <robertmaxrees> MaxLeiter when you submit the form, does the page reload?
[14:19:46] <MaxLeiter> it doesn't reload, it goes to a "was successfully merged"
[14:19:55] <robertmaxrees> does the page URL change?
[14:19:56] <MaxLeiter> but setting target="_blank" makes it open a new page and it works fine
[14:19:57] <MaxLeiter> yes
[14:20:13] <MaxLeiter> so what I did do initially was mass-set target="_self" to target="_blank"
[14:20:16] <robertmaxrees> setting target="_blank" on what?
[14:20:18] <MaxLeiter> on the form
[14:20:40] <MaxLeiter> <form action="/index.php?pid=14518&amp;event_id=68682&amp;create_new=1" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" target="_blank">
[14:20:50] <MaxLeiter> originally was target="_self"
[14:21:34] <robertmaxrees> how are you changing the target?
[14:21:44] <robertmaxrees> are you sure you're changing all of them?
[14:21:54] <MaxLeiter> yes
[14:21:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, fiddle then.
[14:22:13] <MaxLeiter> hmm, it seems to work in a fiddle... maybe it's how they post stuff
[14:22:52] <robertmaxrees> they could be hijacking submits or clicks in a particular way.
[14:23:21] <robertmaxrees> also: pretty sure the selector you were using before wouldn't match the attribute you've set.
[14:25:30] <taplar> it's also kinda a smell to be firing off 'hundreds' of forms
[14:25:38] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:25:42] <robertmaxrees> something seems way off tbh
[14:25:45] <MaxLeiter> its   data entry thing
[14:25:50] <robertmaxrees> hence the requestr for a fiddle.
[14:25:53] <robertmaxrees> *request
[14:25:56] <MaxLeiter> yeah well I think i got it to work
[14:26:01] <MaxLeiter> CPU jumped massively so fingers crossed
[14:26:06] <MaxLeiter> it worked in a fiddle, but here it is
[14:26:14] <MaxLeiter> https://jsfiddle.net/akvy86bv/
[14:26:17] <taplar> nothing data entry demands hundreds of requests at a given time
[14:26:31] <robertmaxrees> taplar you'd be surprised heh
[14:26:48] <taplar> just makes me think the unit of work is too small
[14:26:57] <robertmaxrees> or the system was poorly designed.
[14:27:02] <MaxLeiter> designed very poorly
[14:27:19] <MaxLeiter> if its able to merge the data correctly, a merge button appears
[14:27:22] <MaxLeiter> and I can't have it auto-merge them all
[14:28:18] <robertmaxrees> a buddy of mine is working with a system that validates each input with an ajax requiest and then responds with values of all fields.  so if you're at all competent you wind up having inputs getting reset because the ajax calls are taking so long and finishing after you've done a few others.
[14:28:56] <MaxLeiter> that may be whats happening
[14:29:09] <robertmaxrees> do you work for the state of CA?
[14:29:09] <robertmaxrees>  ;)
[14:29:11] <MaxLeiter> man I wish someone made a "macro recorder" that you can pass js elements into
[14:29:24] <robertmaxrees> "js elements" heh
[14:29:25] <taplar> huh?
[14:29:33] <MaxLeiter> er, elements/nodes/whatever
[14:29:47] <MaxLeiter> well, I do actually (state university), but this isnt a CA project d;
[14:29:50] <robertmaxrees> buddy of mine is basically doing exactly thjat.
[14:30:32] <taplar> for context, what does the submitting do?
[14:30:49] <MaxLeiter> im not 100% sure, it is a post though
[14:31:18] <taplar> is it the same process but for different records?
[14:31:29] <MaxLeiter> yep
[14:32:00] <taplar> then what i might suggest you look into doing, is getting all the forms, serialize them into a single object, and post that object to the backend and let it do all it's work
[14:32:20] <taplar> it'd be an object of arrays or something to keep context, but it'd be just one request
[14:32:32] <robertmaxrees> MaxLeiter are you writing the code for the page itself or are you just using greasemonkey/the console?
[14:32:50] <MaxLeiter> console
[14:33:13] <robertmaxrees> heh.  so you don't really have control over how these are submitted.
[14:33:29] <taplar> so this isn't like an official site thing?
[14:33:42] <robertmaxrees> taplar he's just using it for data entry.
[14:33:54] <taplar> so he's macroing himself
[14:33:59] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[14:34:41] <MaxLeiter> yes
[14:34:46] <MaxLeiter> robertmaxrees: exactly
[14:35:17] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:11:44] <Al_nz1> Morning jq peeps
[15:16:12] <robertmaxrees> good afternoonm
[15:16:15] <robertmaxrees> *afternoon
[15:42:28] <Al_nz1> hey robertmaxrees!!
[15:44:02] <Al_nz1> So I have this form where you can input a scene address and then the details of persons living at this address, but to save time, my database can fetch details of people already linked to the address, so that when you get to the person details you may not have to fill out the details.
[15:45:39] <robertmaxrees> k
[15:45:43] <Al_nz1> The issue is that how do I display the details of previously linked people - I was thinking of jquery autocomplete, but no single field will display enough information to identify a person
[15:46:27] <Al_nz1> Maybe a button that opens a modal displaying the previous people?
[15:46:32] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[15:53:37] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: what way would you do it?
[15:54:16] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) it'd depend on what the system is for, who's using it, etc.
[15:54:53] <Al_nz1> internal use
[15:55:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:55:24] <robertmaxrees> lemme rephrase:
[15:55:38] <robertmaxrees> hard for me to answer because I don't know the constraints or requirements.
[15:56:04] <robertmaxrees> i've done enough work with data entry to know that you have to ask a lot of questions and have a lot of specifics about the data.
[15:57:22] <Al_nz1> ok - I respect and value your input
[15:59:04] <Al_nz1> Is there a way to add each person to autocomplete for one of the inputs (but display more than one field?
[15:59:24] <Al_nz1> ie surname, auto complete list contains firstname+surname ?
[16:06:23] <Braden`> $('#containerButton').click(function() { $('#containerSecond').show(); });  <-- This does not work for some reason.  It also does not throw out any errors.  What might cause this?
[16:06:28] <Braden`> Hello btw!
[16:09:53] <Braden`> Anyone?
[16:17:55] <EastFlow> $('#containerButton').click(function() { $('#containerSecond').show(); },false);
[16:19:25] <EastFlow> also maybe this could work $('#containerButton').on('click', function() { $('#containerSecond').show();});
[16:21:03] <Braden`> What does the false do?
[16:22:38] <EastFlow> callback false
[16:23:00] <EastFlow> $('#containerButton').click(function() { $('#containerSecond').show(); return false;},false);
[16:24:14] <EastFlow> you could also try that.. i'm not sure why sometime jquery freaks out on me if I dont put a return statement in my functions
[16:24:55] <EastFlow> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/128923/whats-the-effect-of-adding-return-false-to-a-click-event-listener
[16:25:38] <robertmaxrees> Braden` what isn't it doing?
[16:25:39] <Braden`> Yea, but a button (not submit) doesn't do anything by itself
[16:25:50] <robertmaxrees> why not make a fiddle?
[16:25:51] <Braden`> Its supposed to make another div become visible
[16:25:54] <Braden`> I can
[16:26:04] <robertmaxrees> also: do you dynamically add that button?
[16:26:07] <Braden`> I was just hoping someone would be like, "Oh yea!  Your mistake is simple"
[16:26:15] <Braden`> No, its hard-coded in
[16:26:28] <robertmaxrees> and you arent' repeating IDs right?
[16:26:33] <Braden`> No
[16:26:36] <Braden`> This is very unique
[16:26:58] <robertmaxrees> try sticking console.log($('[id="containerButton"]').length); just before that binding.
[16:27:22] <Braden`> In the js file?
[16:27:30] <robertmaxrees> yes.  right before you bind the click listener.
[16:27:46] <robertmaxrees> and console.log($('[id="containerSecond"]').length); as the first thing inside that handler.
[16:28:18] <Braden`> 0
[16:28:25] <Braden`> Wait
[16:28:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:28:47] <robertmaxrees> is your code in the head of the page?
[16:28:52] <Braden`> Yes
[16:28:56] <robertmaxrees> in a doc ready?
[16:29:08] <Braden`> The .js file is not doc ready

[16:30:13] <robertmaxrees> thanks.
[16:30:21] <robertmaxrees> the js file contents.
[16:30:26] <robertmaxrees> is there a document ready?
[16:30:31] <EastFlow> lol Do i even need this line? <!DOCTYPE html>
[16:30:36] <robertmaxrees> EastFlow yep.
[16:30:45] <Braden`> What do you mean document ready?
[16:30:58] <robertmaxrees> Braden` heh.  something like $(document).ready(function() {})
[16:31:03] <robertmaxrees> or $(function() {});
[16:31:08] <Braden`> Oh, there is later on
[16:31:13] <Braden`> Not before this event though
[16:31:18] <robertmaxrees> your handler needs to be inside of that code.
[16:31:26] <Braden`> Oh
[16:31:28] <Braden`> I see
[16:31:34] <Braden`> Thank you.  I will make the modifications
[16:31:44] <robertmaxrees> definitely.

[17:54:50] <robertmaxrees> well yeah :) so they can contact you to follow up with additional clarification/help.
[17:55:45] <website-feedback> I don't like logging in, especially just to report a quick bug or issue.
[17:55:57] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:56:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:57:00] <robertmaxrees> they use gh issues for everything.
[17:57:08] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty accepted practice at this point.
[17:57:13] <robertmaxrees> what was your issue with the site?
[17:57:54] <website-feedback> This page...

[17:57:58] <robertmaxrees> eep.
[17:58:09] <robertmaxrees> multiline pastes are a no-no in general :)
[17:58:13] <robertmaxrees> but good catch.
[17:58:53] <robertmaxrees> kind of surprising you don't have a github account.
[17:59:05] <website-feedback> what'ts wrong with pasting a good, non-spam, multi-line report? That's how I format all my website bug reports, pointing to the exact page with the problem...
[17:59:25] <robertmaxrees> it notifies the channel a bunch of times because it spams one message for each line.
[17:59:41] <robertmaxrees> outside of IRC that'd be totally fine :) just letting you know!
[17:59:43] <website-feedback> it might depend on the client tho
[17:59:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:59:59] <robertmaxrees> so we should penalize people that have notifications turned on?
[18:00:27] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just pointing it outl
[18:00:30] <robertmaxrees> either way, good catch!
[18:00:43] <website-feedback> yes, if a client is badly designed & notifies many times in a row for closely-pasted msgs, then yes, it's a client dev problem
[18:00:52] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[18:00:57] <robertmaxrees> but OK :)
[18:01:31] <website-feedback> I'd think a client should only notify once per 10 secs per person talking...that would eliminate multiple notifications for a multi-line paste
[18:01:50] <robertmaxrees> so you should penalize the users of the software instead of notifying the dev or requesting a feature?
[18:02:21] <website-feedback> I don't use whatever client you are using, if I was, I would report the bug, but you are using whatever notified you too many times...
[18:02:32] <robertmaxrees> i have notifications turned off.
[18:02:42] <robertmaxrees> but that doesn't mean that my preference should override others'.
[18:02:54] <robertmaxrees> just general etiquette to not do multiline pasts into channelks.
[18:03:03] <robertmaxrees> not sure why that's such a big deal, but okie :)
[18:03:41] <website-feedback> So, I should either manually re-type all of that over again, or paste very slowly 1-line-at-a-time? That's alot of work.
[18:03:59] <robertmaxrees> nah.  just in the future you paste a single line or two.
[18:04:14] <website-feedback> I can't put that whole report in 1 or 2 lines tho...
[18:04:26] <robertmaxrees> sure you can!  but it really isn't a big deal :)
[18:07:50] <website-feedback> so do u think anyone is gonna notice & fix this issue...or what?...I could paste my report once more (with multiple lines) in #jQuery-dev but that's more for jQuery development not really the website dev...which is why a Feedback Form, for Website Issues, is needed
[18:08:41] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty standard at this point to expect developers to have github accounts.  not sure what your hang-up is there.  you can try to spam that channel but there's no guarantee that they'll see it or do anything with it.
[18:08:58] <robertmaxrees> maybe they will, tho!
[18:09:33] <website-feedback> I'm not gonna "spam" any channel, but I could paste my report once in there before I get off IRC
[18:09:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:45:30] <website-feedback> yay, someone fixed it! -- https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/pull/164
[20:05:12] <sms> Hello everybody
[20:05:38] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[20:05:46] <sopparus> can jquery ajax handle two jsons from the php file?
[20:05:57] <sopparus> as in two jsos_encode reponse from the php file
[20:06:11] <sms> Two json responses?
[20:06:25] <sms> Are you out of your mind?!
[20:06:54] <sopparus> i guess so
[20:10:00] <robertmaxrees> sopparus that's not really a valid response.
[20:10:11] <robertmaxrees> you'll have a helluva time trying to parse that.
[20:10:24] <robertmaxrees> is each one the same base object format?
[20:10:30] <sopparus> php merge array would be the right solution perhaps?
[20:10:41] <website-feedback> sopparus: I've never tried, but if it can't handle it by default, can't you string split the json's (like on a new line), then process each json with jQuery separately?
[20:10:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you wanmna shove back a single object.
[20:10:53] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:10:59] <robertmaxrees> "process each json with jQuery"?
[20:11:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd just slap them into a single object and call it a day.
[20:11:25] <robertmaxrees> or array of two objects, depending on what their format is.
[20:12:03] <website-feedback> yes single object is better, but I was trying to think of a way to do exactly what was asked, handle 2 separate json responses...
[20:12:24] <robertmaxrees> heh, bad problem domain for jquery imo.
[20:12:29] <robertmaxrees> get a valid response instead.
[20:12:36] <website-feedback> string split was my 1st idea, even it not the best ultimate way to do this
[20:14:44] <robertmaxrees> we tend to try to offer the "best" solution here in general since oftentimes hacky fixes can come back to bite you later :)
[20:18:04] <Al_nz1> website-feedback: listen to robertmaxrees
[20:19:14] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[20:19:27] <robertmaxrees> hardly.  i've just made lots of mistakes ;)
[20:19:45] <sms> Has anybody here used Datatables?
[20:20:16] <robertmaxrees> sms feel free asking your question buuuut you're more likely to get assistance using their forums :)
[20:20:18] <robertmaxrees> just a heads up.
[20:21:04] <sms> Hmm, I don't think it's exactly Datatable related issue, but it is involved with the issue I'm having
[20:21:23] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[20:21:37] <sms> So basically, I'm using a template to setup a website right now, the template uses AJAX to display pages dynamically
[20:22:33] <sms> So, I display a table in a div using jQuery and Datatables, it's a fairly basic example to
[20:22:45] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[20:23:13] <sms> When I initially go to the page it's fine, but when I navigate away and come back to the page with the table, I get a stack overflow in console and nothing is displayed
[20:23:49] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[20:24:14] <sms> Hmm, what should I fiddle? Just the table?
[20:24:49] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.  i know nothing about your setup, your code, your site, etc. so i'm not sure what you have that would help me figure out the issue.
[20:25:48] <sms> Yeah I'll try to put together some resources
[20:26:09] <robertmaxrees> generally, a self-contained, minimum test case is generally what we need.
[20:26:30] <sms> Basically the way the pages are displayed, they're displayed and cleaned up with a script
[20:26:55] <sms> So what I'm thinking is the table isn't being cleaned up properly when navigating away
[20:27:06] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual error you're getting?
[20:27:14] <sms> Sec
[20:27:17] <sms> Let me get it
[20:33:50] <sms> Sorry about that
[20:34:09] <robertmaxrees> all good!
[20:34:43] <sms> One more second, Weechat doesn't want to let me paste for some reason
[20:34:50] <robertmaxrees> oh wait
[20:34:54] <robertmaxrees> use bpaste or somethinjg.
[20:34:59] <robertmaxrees> in case it's a bigun
[20:40:02] <sms> www.bpaste.net/show/80d90913bf13
[20:40:12] <sms> My bad
[20:40:14] <sms> That was really weird
[20:41:15] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  could you paste your datatables stuff into a paste?
[20:41:25] <website-feedback> Umm: http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.bpaste.net
[20:41:28] <sms> Yeah, sure
[20:41:40] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/80d90913bf13 website-feedback
[20:42:42] <website-feedback> (OK, I have to comment: a paste. for. 3. lines. -- 3. lines.)
[20:42:52] <sms> But the weird thing is, it works fine the first load
[20:42:58] <sms> Just not when you navigate back
[20:43:04] <robertmaxrees> website-feedback yep :) makes it easy to refer back to what they said.
[20:43:04] <sms> Second I'll paste it
[20:43:24] <website-feedback> I completely understand using a paste for like 10+ lines but not 3...
[20:43:44] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) if you don't like it you're welcome to not stay.
[20:44:49] <website-feedback> I've been here wayyy longer than I planned on...not that I'm leaving due to now liking the pasting thingy, I just almost never use IRC, except when I'm reporting a bug & they website/project has no other contact method...
[20:44:55] <website-feedback> now = not
[20:45:31] <sms> Hahaha, I was having issues with copy pasting into Weechat
[20:45:36] <sms> I had to manually type that
[20:45:42] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :)
[20:46:08] <sms> Think something is wrong with my keybindings but didn't want to leave robert hanging here
[20:46:16] <sms> https://bpaste.net/show/dbff4268e45f
[20:47:06] <website-feedback> (there we go 50 lines, paste-worthy)
[20:47:49] <sms> That's what the script looks like, but that's nested in a template script, I'll show you that to
[20:49:31] <robertmaxrees> nothing in there seems amiss.  what happens if you comment out that init for datatables?
[20:49:35] <robertmaxrees> does the same error happen?
[20:51:08] <sms> The init being var table = ...
[20:51:11] <sms> ?
[20:51:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  that whole block of code.
[20:51:22] <sms> Let me check
[20:51:28] <robertmaxrees> i know it won't init any more but I'd be curious if you get the same error.
[20:52:09] <sms> Yeah works fine without that
[20:52:28] <sms> Here, this should be of interest to you though
[20:52:39] <sms> https://bpaste.net/show/6a78112af191
[20:52:43] <website-feedback> (apparently, I'm not supposed to comment in IRC, unless I conform to the norm :shrug:)
[20:52:58] <sms> This is actually how it looks like, should have sent it like this to begin with
[20:53:27] <robertmaxrees> sure, but just calling .DataTable causes the error, right?
[20:53:45] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe it's erroring when you try to reinit or the element doersn't exist.
[20:55:08] <sms> Yeah, it's just the DataTable that's causing issues, works fine when I comment it out
[20:55:20] <sms> And it also works fine when I first go to the page
[20:55:24] <robertmaxrees> hr,/
[20:55:26] <robertmaxrees> *hrm.
[20:55:33] <robertmaxrees> are you using pushtates or something?
[20:56:10] <sms> Pushtates?
[20:56:21] <robertmaxrees> *pushstates
[20:56:43] <robertmaxrees> like, what does it mean when you say you go "back"?
[20:58:54] <robertmaxrees> just trying to build a mental map.
[20:59:01] <sms> Oh, when I go back to the page. So when I just go directly to http://127.0.0.1:8000/#ajax/datatable.html, the table will appear fine
[20:59:16] <robertmaxrees> hrmmmm
[20:59:22] <sms> But when I navigate to a different page in the sidebar like index.html or whatever, then I go navigate back to datatables.html, it'll throw that error
[20:59:28] <sms> It'll take really long to load to
[20:59:43] <sms> Just Loading... for about 6 seconds before the error is raised
[21:00:40] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm.
[21:00:48] <robertmaxrees> i have no cluie.
[21:00:58] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like it doesn't like be re-initialized.
[21:01:05] <robertmaxrees> what does your navigation logic look like?
[21:02:01] <sms> Well it's displayed dynamically with AJAX, so the navigation is actually handled by an app.js I believe
[21:02:16] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:02:34] <robertmaxrees> i gathered as much - was wondering if you could share the specific code.
[21:02:41] <sms> Ohh, here let me get it
[21:02:58] <sms> I know I keep emphasizing that but
[21:03:10] <sms> I think that's the cause
[21:07:57] <sms> https://bpaste.net/show/a5ffa67bc41f here's how the URL is loaded
[21:08:36] <robertmaxrees> mmhmm mhmm
[21:08:49] <robertmaxrees> so - does your datatables init stuff actually wait for the ajax code to finish?
[21:09:55] <sms> It should, yeah
[21:10:28] <robertmaxrees> then i got nothing.  it really looks like you're trying to reinit on something.
[21:10:31] <robertmaxrees> but i could be totally off.
[21:10:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see if break.]
[21:10:56] <robertmaxrees> somebody in the datatables forums might be able to help more though!
[21:11:16] <sms> Did you see that one paste of how I have it set up inside the template script?
[21:11:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[21:11:39] <sms> It's below the pageLoad(); function so I don't know
[21:11:42] <sms> Should be fine
[21:12:04] <robertmaxrees> what does pageload() do?
[21:12:16] <robertmaxrees> is that an ajax call?
[21:12:21] <sms> Sorry, pageSetUp();
[21:12:30] <sms> Let me see
[21:13:09] <robertmaxrees> also: you could probably just $('#someContainer').html(''); instead of all this specific unload logic.
[21:13:34] <sms> Oh, pageSetUp basically just loads all the navigation bars
[21:13:35] <robertmaxrees> or init on first hit and then hide/show so you don't have to manage unloading things l;ike this.
[21:14:00] <sms> Hmm
[21:17:45] <sms> It's also weird
[21:17:57] <sms> Even if I don't navigate directly to it, I can go to the index, then navigate to it and it'll work
[21:18:12] <sms> But then if I leave again and come back it doesn't work
[21:18:24] <sms> BUT, I got a different error this time which might be a clue
[21:18:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so any time after the first time you hit it.
[21:18:34] <sms> Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[21:18:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i stand by what i said before heh
[21:19:04] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it break it's hard to help.
[21:19:32] <sms> Alright
[21:19:37] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go home. enjoy!@
[21:19:46] <sms> Do I just package this all in a tarball so you can run it locally?
[21:19:49] <sms> Jk haha
[21:20:01] <sms> Thanks for the help robert
[21:20:08] <sms> Appreciate it
