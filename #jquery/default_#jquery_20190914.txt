[13:19:39] <bit-2> hello
[13:20:22] <bit-2> how to generate a dropdown listview text input in jquerymobile ? example to select areacode ? couldnt find it in listview
[15:29:27] <ringzer0> Reason why this wouldn't work: <div class="table"><a data-value="x"></div> ; $('.table a').on('click', (e) => { console.log($(this).data('value')); } ... undefined??
[15:29:51] <ringzer0> is "value" a reserved attribute or something for data-*?
[15:34:35] <ringzer0> ... i can't even do: $(this).attr('data-value'), ideas anyone?
[15:54:27] <shoky> ringzer0: `this` works different in arrow functions. for jquery usage you're better off using a regular function,  or use e.target instead of this
[16:03:29] <ringzer0> shoky: Wow; had no idea. thank you!!
