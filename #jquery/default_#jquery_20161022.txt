[05:45:08] <eigentor> I do not get it. I have Elements that have country codes as classes. They have a lot of classes: views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first views-row-last ES
[05:46:09] <eigentor> Now If i want to select an  element that has the class .views-row and also the class ES, I try it this way if($('.view-organisations-world-map .view-grouping .views-row').hasClass('ES'))
[05:46:17] <eigentor> but this does not select the element
[05:46:45] <eigentor> so basically my question is: how do I select an element that has one class and also another class
[05:48:29] <eigentor> I could do it like this $('.view-organisations-world-map .view-grouping .views-row.ES')
[05:48:40] <eigentor> But I need to pass the Country code in as a variable

[13:02:00] <fury_> quick stupid noob question. if I have: { var form = $(...); /* ... */ $.post(url, ...).fail(function(x) { }); } - why isn't 'form' available inside of .fail(function(x){})?
[13:02:37] <fury_> is my understanding of scope unclear?

[13:30:23] <jak2013> hi all
[13:30:57] <jak2013>  $('#btnGrabar0, #btnGrabar1').on('click', function () {    how to know wich button was pressed?
[13:32:17] <ChrisWarrick> this
[13:33:02] <jak2013> ChrisWarrick but i need know: if (#btnGrabar0) then alert('button1')
[13:33:03] <jak2013> something
[13:33:52] <ChrisWarrick> jak2013: this.attributes['id']
[13:36:40] <jak2013> if (this.attributes['id']==='#btnGrabar0'){
[13:36:48] <jak2013> checking
[13:37:41] <ChrisWarrick> without #
[13:47:52] <jak2013> ok
[15:53:24] <fury_> given <tr class="a"></tr><tr class="b"></tr><tr class="c"></tr>, with $('tr.c'), how can I find the first tr.a previous to tr.c? $('tr.c').prev('tr.a') doesn't work - elements have to be immediately adjacent for prev to match.
[15:54:25] <fury_> .closest() also returns an empty set.
[16:00:53] <fury_> I mean I can solve it using { var tr = $('tr.c').prev(); while (tr.attr('class') != 'a') { tr = tr.prev(); } }
[16:00:57] <fury_> but there's got to be a better way

[17:42:11] <ashzade> Evening everyone. I'm adding some custom code to a site that uses AJAX buttons to remove items on the page. I'm trying to add a confirmation to the remove button using the following code https://jsfiddle.net/z7p0q4an/ but The 'events' object is returning undefined.
[17:55:37] <kof> I guess your selector is wrong
