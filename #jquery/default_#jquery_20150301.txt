[00:26:31] <latemus> The problem is that when I use $.each() here, each of data[0], data[1], data[2], etc. ends up containing an entire array; i need to iterate over each array element, _for each array_ within the multidimensional arry -->  http://pastebin.com/g6UDN0Db
[00:27:55] <latemus> http://domain.tld/api/resources/readAjax.php is returning multiple arrays like this    [["1","256","10","1","2","3","1","d91c2561-e718-4e50-b606-6a4ff943"],["1","256","10","4","5","6","2","ef105d09-81e0-4f01-bdb4-fcbd262c"]]
[00:57:45] <Cork> latemus: so add another $.each loop
[01:55:24] <latemus> hmm.. So i have two json arrays, each with 8 elements, all contained in a single var data. When i print them using an $.each() loop, the two arrays each get printed 8 times. I just want to iterate for each array (and dump it's child elements into vars to print), not thoir elements too
[02:04:06] <Cork> ?code
[02:04:06] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:37:35] <latemus> Cork: here's the code http://fixee.org/paste/ni87to3/
[02:38:18] <Cork> uh... i already answered you this last time you asked
[02:39:44] <latemus> Cork: Nah.. line 13 is commented out -- that's where i added another $.each
[02:40:02] <latemus> and i got 4 times as many duplicate lines as i am now
[02:42:16] <adamp> Hi guys!
[02:42:40] <adamp> Can I ask a question?
[02:42:44] <arthurvr> Yes.
[02:43:25] <adamp> Is jQuery.Deferred a constructor? Isn't it a factory method?
[02:47:49] <latemus> As of now (the code i pasted), i am only getting one duplicate of each record the db returns
[02:50:10] <latemus> Woohoo! It was because of line 12. I commented it out and no dupes!
[02:50:50] <latemus> i guess reassigment was actually adding to what was being iterated over... wierd
[02:51:30] <Cork> latemus: http://jsfiddle.net/ucyq98ug/
[02:51:35] <Cork> latemus: something like that
[02:51:46] <Cork> but you should seriously look at a template engine
[02:52:09] <Cork> you shouldn't keep that much html in js, its a mess and hard to maintain (and read)
[02:52:56] <arthurvr> Yup. Templating engine ftw :-)
[02:53:00] <Cork> opps forgot to remove all the excess variables
[02:53:18] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ucyq98ug/1/
[02:53:40] <Cork> ya i can recommend jqote, mustashe is good too
[02:53:54] <Cork> (make sure you use jqote2 if you go for that one)
[02:54:07] <latemus> Cork: Thanks so much!
[02:54:25] <latemus> Yeah, I know; I hate embedding so much html in js
[02:54:26] <Cork> took a while to clean up the code ^^'
[02:54:32] <latemus> hehe
[02:54:41] <latemus> Thank you for doing that :)
[02:54:45] <Cork> np
[02:54:53] <arthurvr> Go checkout htmlbars too :-)
[02:56:19] <Cork> ya, a good rule is normally to never hold "nested" elements in js
[02:56:29] <latemus> Cork: Woah, your code is nicely succinct
[02:56:34] <Cork> if you need to create more then a single element, it shouldn't be kept in js
[02:56:42] <latemus> NIce
[02:56:57] <latemus> Can you include an html file insteadZ
[02:57:14] <Cork> yes, though a template engine
[02:57:23] <Cork> or have it inline in the page
[02:57:44] <Cork> the later is normally prefered as it doesn't need extra http calls
[02:57:55] <latemus> arthurvr: thanks, i wiil
[02:58:09] <arthurvr> latemus: fyi https://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars
[02:58:29] <latemus> Cork: Cool, i'll look into those template engines
[02:58:43] <latemus> I'd rather not have spaghetti all over
[03:00:41] <Cork> ?g jqute2
[03:00:42] <b-ot> Cork: Sorry, no results for ‟jqute2”.

[03:29:00] <ph88> i have a list of buttons with a click event. I add another button, should i register the click event again to register it for the new button ?
[03:40:08] <fredo> Hello! I have some problems implementing a collapsible sidebar. Base system is a Contao CMS. The css is responsive. In the mobile view the sidebar #left collapses to a width of "50px". A <a class="left-toggle"> element appears. What a want to do now, is to give collapse/expand properties to this element. The js is http://paste.ofcode.org/w8b39ZNtMp6kTQrYwTZSjE
[03:40:45] <fredo> .left-expand {width:300px;}
[03:41:34] <fredo> I think there is a point I didn't understand completely... It doesn't work that way.
[04:18:05] <Jabby__> Hey guys, I'm new to ajax calls and javascript really and abit confused, if someone could help me that would be great :) So I'm wanting to create an ajax progress bar, my php script is going to echo the percentage complete. So i'm looking at this example here http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/ . Is this relevant to my needs?
[04:18:16] <Jabby__> if not, could someone point me in the right direction?
[06:05:58] <no_gravity> How do you call something like "#myform input:checkbox:checked"? an identifier? a selector?
[06:09:10] <arthurvr> no_gravity: selector
[06:09:20] <no_gravity> ok, thanks.
[06:09:21] <Garfield-fr> no_gravity: #myform input[type=checkbox]:checked or $('#checkbox-id').is(':checked')
[07:23:24] <ph88> i have a list of buttons with a click event. I add another button, should i register the click event again to register it for the new button ?
[07:24:19] <ph88> nvm im just gonna go with event delegation
[07:39:43] <Cork> ph88: you should use delegated event listener if you want the same action on them
[07:40:18] <ph88> yes Cork i keep forgetting this .. luckely it only took me 1 hour this time to remember :|
[08:13:33] <kokut> Hello, i have to validate a name field, it should have support for different languages (latin script, mostly) is there anything i can grab that's already done? because i'm going nuts with the regular expressions etc
[08:16:49] <BadCodSmell> I thought the documentation used to let you comment but it seems that now that feature is missing
[08:19:32] <BadCodSmell> I have to sanity check http://api.jquery.com/detach/ to make sure that it does not trigger the remove event rather than rely on assumption and then add to comments :).
[09:09:14] <Guddu> I have this check in my code
[09:09:14] <Guddu> if ( $('tr').length <=1 )
[09:09:28] <Guddu> HOw can i modify this to check only for <tr> that have a id specified?
[09:27:22] <BadCodSmell> Guddu: tr[id] probably... or tr#id but honestly, what you are doing looks dodgy.
[09:27:36] <BadCodSmell> tr#id is a fail because #id should be unique, a class is better
[09:27:42] <Guddu> Oh Ok
[09:27:50] <Guddu> Thanks BadCodSmell Will look at adding class instead
[09:27:57] <Guddu> And look for .hasClass or something?
[09:28:01] <BadCodSmell> tr[id], this is not a good way to categorise one set of trs from another...
[09:28:05] <BadCodSmell> tr.class_name :)
[09:28:35] <BadCodSmell> And you can do tr.is('.classname') though normally you would want to avoid using .is but there can be special cases like manual toggling, etc.
[09:46:37] <kylerain> Hi guys
[09:47:33] <kylerain> I'm working with Knackhq, database builder so I have little control over my data, but they support js, jquery and http get requests
[09:48:13] <kylerain> I'm just trying to learn and curious, trying to pull my json objects to familiarize myself with their layout, and having no success
[09:48:54] <meaneye_> Hi. Did anyone notice that if you use $.extend with empty jQuery set as first param, and jQuery object as second, length of empty set never increases?
[09:50:14] <kylerain> my request is successful, but I;m trying to call a function to display the data, ex. .text(data) only returns [object Object]
[09:50:53] <kylerain> any ideas on how to read my object after successful get?
[09:51:13] <kylerain> without already knowing its layout?
[09:51:15] <meaneye_> kylerain, can you be more specific with "display the data"
[09:51:32] <meaneye_> You can json stringify, or iterate over elements.
[09:51:44] <meaneye_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify
[09:52:03] <kylerain> i want to see my data and how it is labeled
[09:52:17] <meaneye_> Well, for debugging purposes, stringify is good enough.
[09:52:27] <kylerain> sure, thank you
[09:52:29] <meaneye_> If you need dynamic access you can always have loop in form of
[09:52:46] <meaneye_> for (var key in data) { value = data[key]; }
[10:47:44] <pyemkey_> Hello all :)
[10:48:18] <pyemkey_> I am looking for example of putting own styling on selectmenu
[10:49:51] <tandroid> pyemkey_: like a plugin that lets you do it?
[10:49:52] <tandroid> http://adam.co/lab/jquery/customselect/
[10:50:27] <kokut> hello anyone knows a good way to validate some name/password fields?
[10:51:06] <tandroid> kokut: http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[10:51:13] <kokut> i can't afford to spend a lot of time writing thousands o lines and regular expressions really
[10:53:31] <kokut> tandroid: that has its own style and other stuff i dont need
[10:53:47] <tandroid> it's own style?
[10:53:57] <kokut> i'm watching the video
[10:54:21] <tandroid> kokut: they probably styled the elements just so it looked better but that's certainly not part of the plugin.
[10:56:37] <pyemkey_> tandroid: I thought about move my own style to customselect from jquery UI. Your example of plugin customselect show that I can put own style on the select, but not option. I know that I cannot style option and need to use <ul> instead.
[10:56:49] <HGtronic> Hello how to display modal form for relevent image like on fb when u open an image the pop shows up for that image and soo..  currently i see allways the details of the last image... somehow its not getting the right id of  photo
[10:57:49] <kokut> tandroid: i can enter @@@ and other symbols
[10:58:00] <kokut> http://jqueryvalidation.org/files/demo/ type @@@@@in the name
[10:58:28] <tandroid> pyemkey_: you can't style option elements in html.
[10:58:34] <tandroid> it is completely handled by the browser.
[10:58:41] <kokut> i can't believe this validation thing is going to take so much time and its just boring
[10:59:40] <pyemkey_> tandroid: I know that I can't, but I am looking for example of putting own styles for customselect from jquery ui
[11:00:30] <ajf-> Is there a shorter way to do this? var years = []; $('[name="budget[years][]"]').map(function(i, input) { years.push($(input).val()) });
[11:00:32] <ajf-> like, can I get an array of the .val() attributes for all those inputs in a single run ?
[11:00:44] <tandroid> kokut: please read the documentation. I don't know much about this plugin and that's what I'm doing. I can clearly see that you can do custom validations http://jqueryvalidation.org/category/methods/#example:-makes-“parent”-required-only-if-age-is-below-13
[11:01:24] <kokut> tandroid: yea looks like i'm going to have to spend a lot of hours into this :\ didn't think it was going to be like this really
[11:01:33] <kokut> still have to do a lof ot logic stuff
[11:01:46] <tandroid> pyemkey_: oh, customSelect just gives you a span with a class of .customSelect that you can style.
[11:01:57] <kokut> besides i'm going to have to validate everything again in the back-end just in case the client has javascript disabled
[11:02:05] <shoky> ajf-: var years = $('[name="budget[years][]"]').map(function() { return this.value });
[11:02:39] <tandroid> kokut: why do you need such intense validation?
[11:03:12] <tandroid> if someone puts their name as @@@@@ I doubt you're ever going to get them to enter their real name anyway.
[11:03:22] <kokut> tandroid: well you are right, i probably won't need that much validation, it's just when i take on something i get a little bit obsessed and until its not like i want it get fucking frustrated
[11:03:43] <kokut> i*
[11:04:49] <tandroid> I get that. I'm the same way, but you never hit deadlines that way and the thing is, your clients and users will never know you spent the extra time.
[11:04:53] <kokut> you know what you are right, i'm going to write my own validation system
[11:05:03] <tandroid> ?
[11:05:09] <tandroid> that's now what I'm saying ha
[11:05:15] <tandroid> quite the opposite.
[11:05:52] <HGtronic> $( "#button-wrapper").on('click', '#modal-form', function() {
[11:05:52] <HGtronic>                 $( "#modal-form" + $(this).attr('rel') ).toggle().focus();
[11:05:52] <HGtronic>             });
[11:05:56] <kokut> i think that if i write it myself its probably going to take less time than learning how to change this plugin's code to my needs
[11:06:06] <HGtronic> how to write when clicked open model
[11:06:06] <HGtronic> ?
[11:10:14] <tandroid> kokut: half of being a good developer is learning how to use other peoples code.
[11:11:08] <tandroid> Also, the link I pasted shows exactly how to write custom validation rules and so there's really no reason to not just do that.
[11:11:17] <kokut> but it's not even what i need man, it has a command that is something like $('form').validate(); but i dont even have a form, i'm going to submit the field with JSON
[11:11:54] <tandroid> alright
[11:20:20] <Sal> why does a click event fire when i i do $('div').on('click' ....)
[11:20:37] <Sal> while it doesn't if i do <div onclick="..."></div>
[11:20:56] <Sal> does anyonw know why?
[11:23:11] <dn5> Sal: onclick() is called when you have declared function
[11:23:25] <dn5> Sal: post your function on jsbin.com
[11:25:43] <Sal> dns, its a simple click on a semi-transparent div that is shown under a slide-in panels and makes it modal
[11:26:06] <Sal> but i don't get the difference
[11:26:31] <dn5> Sal: one second
[11:26:36] <Sal> why should the click fire when i add the listener with jquery and why it doesn't with it on html
[11:26:59] <Sal> let me build a sample
[11:31:38] <dn5> Sal: http://jsfiddle.net/vdbjnLqk/
[11:32:51] <Sal> i'm talking about empty divs
[11:32:59] <Sal> wait, i almost finished thesample
[11:35:46] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/fxa67u0e/
[11:35:50] <Sal> not working at all
[11:35:51] <Sal> damn
[11:35:59] <Sal> my eyes
[11:36:58] <Sal> missing jquery, sorry
[11:37:17] <Sal> look what i mean: http://jsfiddle.net/fxa67u0e/1/
[11:37:28] <Sal> click on blue works
[11:37:31] <Sal> click on red no
[11:37:33] <Sal> why?
[11:38:01] <shoky> Sal: because your "clicked" function is not global (because jsfiddle puts it inside an onLoad handler because you have "onLoad" chosen on the left). and onclick attribute can only access global functions
[11:38:20] <dn5> Sal: you forgot (), http://jsfiddle.net/fxa67u0e/2/
[11:38:34] <shoky> he didn't forget ()
[11:39:01] <dn5> shoky: He did if that is what he wanted, of course he didn't put it inside the body wrapped but onload
[11:39:10] <dn5> shoky: I think he already knows that
[11:39:15] <shoky> dn5: he didn't want the alert to happen before anything is clicked
[11:39:47] <Sal> shoky, i have the same problem in my files, without jsfiddle
[11:40:10] <shoky> Sal: then don't use onclick attributes
[11:40:24] <Sal> damn
[11:40:34] <Sal> o hate mixing things
[11:40:47] <Sal> because when you have to change something, you never know where it is
[11:41:04] <Sal> thats why i wanted to use all html onclick
[11:41:13] <dn5> Sal: http://jsfiddle.net/fxa67u0e/3/
[11:43:26] <Sal> wait a second....
[11:43:31] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/fxa67u0e/5/
[11:43:56] <dn5> Sal: why do you use .on() function?
[11:43:57] <Sal> you means that putting a listener to #a insiode document.ready, lets the #b listener work?
[11:43:59] <Sal> OMG!
[11:44:33] <Sal> dns: i use on() because on <buttons> click() soesn't work
[11:44:33] <shoky> Sal: no it has nothing to do with that
[11:44:52] <shoky> Sal: it works because you're not on "onLoad" anymore
[11:44:57] <Sal> then why is the html onclick now working?
[11:45:04] <dn5> Sal: that is not correct, you've used onLoad
[11:45:21] <dn5> Sal: because I wrapped jquery inside the body
[11:45:36] <shoky> .click(function) and .on('click', function)  are the same thing, btw
[11:46:02] <Sal> shoky, i know, but i gad problems with <button> element
[11:46:02] <dn5> Sal: look at what shoky had told you, on and click are same function, click is on underneath
[11:46:42] <Sal> anyway, still didn't get why it works now
[11:46:56] <dn5> Sal: look to the left side
[11:46:59] <Sal> gotget about the jsfiddle wrapper...
[11:47:04] <shoky> Sal: when you choose "onLoad" in jsfiddle it makes your code NOT global. so onclick can't access it
[11:47:05] <Sal> i don't have that on my files
[11:47:08] <dn5> Sal: in jsfidlle..
[11:47:21] <dn5> Sal: bellow library choosing
[11:47:46] <dn5> Sal: It says No wrap in <body>
[11:48:12] <dn5> do you see it?
[11:48:16] <Sal> yes
[11:48:22] <Sal> but wait....
[11:48:32] <Sal> let me write this stuff in another playground
[11:48:46] <dn5> Sal: do it
[11:48:59] <dn5> There will be your answer
[11:50:49] <Sal> http://jsbin.com/fivirukibo/1/
[11:50:53] <Sal> working
[11:51:05] <Sal> but the problem is that its not working on my code
[11:51:06] <Sal> :(
[11:51:31] <Sal> wait, i have opacity set
[11:51:34] <Sal> let me try
[11:52:06] <dn5> lol dude.. what is your code, put it in pastebin
[11:52:23] <Sal> too big
[11:52:40] <Sal> let me check it again
[11:52:51] <dn5> post only necessary stuff
[11:54:08] <Sal> this is the div: <div class="m-mask-modal" onclick="toggleNav();"></div>
[11:54:25] <Sal> simple onclick
[11:54:41] <Sal> and not fireing
[11:55:18] <dn5> Sal: do you think I'm clairvoyant to know your other code?
[11:55:33] <Sal> but in the same file i have this: <a href="#" title="Navigation" class="m-icon-btn" onclick="toggleNav();"><i class="fa fa-bars"></i></a>
[11:55:43] <Sal> thats has the same onclick, that works
[11:55:53] <Sal> wait...!!!
[11:56:01] <dn5> post your m-mask-modal css in jsfiddle
[11:56:12] <Sal> could if be bacause the div is initially display: none ?
[11:56:29] <dn5> Yes
[11:56:35] <dn5> That makes it unvisible
[11:56:42] <Sal> no, wait, its visibility: hidden
[11:56:44] <dn5> You are then clicking on parent attribute
[11:57:39] <Sal> but when i open the side-panel, the mask div shows up under it
[11:57:57] <Sal> so, i need to reconenct the listener?
[11:58:39] <dn5> I don't know, you tell me. Does the visiblity change
[11:58:48] <Sal> yes
[11:58:59] <dn5> Then it should work
[11:59:01] <Sal> ok, i'll be back in 30 mins
[11:59:06] <Sal> will you still be here?
[11:59:13] <Sal> i'm build a better sample
[11:59:25] <Sal> i'm=i'll
[11:59:36] <Sal> thanks for now
[11:59:41] <dn5> I'm not only one on this channel
[11:59:41] <Sal> have to go
[11:59:42] <Sal> bbl
[13:04:45] <afmza> hi, anyone found a proper fix for the extra white space at the bottom of that page when a jquery ui dialog is displayed?
[14:57:54] <_blizzy_> hello, I have a div that is a link. I want to visit the link when I click it once, but on a double click, disable going to the link and show a popup.
[14:57:57] <_blizzy_> how would I achieve this?
[15:00:49] <_blizzy_> actually nvm.
[15:00:50] <_blizzy_> thanks.
[15:22:42] <ismarkup> jsfiddle seems to be down

[15:24:33] <ismarkup> *shrug*
[15:24:42] <ismarkup> thanks btw
[15:25:51] <ismarkup> nevermind…the jsbin spotted the error
[15:25:52] <ismarkup> thanks a ton
[15:26:10] <beasty> you forgot the . :p
[15:26:48] <BillCriswell> .on
[15:27:24] <ismarkup> yup
[15:27:37] <ismarkup> can’t believe this jsbin spotted it so quick
[15:27:39] <ismarkup> very nice
[15:28:08] <BillCriswell> jsbin didn't spot it though.
[15:28:22] <BillCriswell> Well.. it gave a misleading error.
[15:28:38] <BillCriswell> So I guess it did.
[15:30:35] <beasty> it gave the correct line :)
[15:31:26] <BillCriswell> I'm so used to seeing that missing semi-colon error I always think it's telling me exactly that though.
[15:32:06] <beasty> hmm pondering what's wrong with the internet
[15:34:50] <BillCriswell> beasty: Anonymity
[15:35:01] <BillCriswell> I think that's how you spell it.
[15:35:42] <beasty> BillCriswell: no i'm having problems on foreign surfing
[16:01:45] <mirotlu> maybe someone can help me with this

[16:35:00] <NABrown> anyone used the package mixitup before?
[16:57:38] <CorySimmons> Hi, I'm trying to make a jQuery plugin. Can anyone tell me why Ln 18 returns undefined? http://pastie.org/9992440
[16:58:00] <CorySimmons> If I console.log(element) it returns .scroll-trigger
[16:59:18] <NABrown> nobody's ever used MixItUp?
[16:59:24] <NABrown> I'm having some issues I'd love help with
[17:01:09] <CorySimmons> NABrown: Sorry I haven't used MixItUp
[17:01:29] <NABrown> thanks anyways
[17:01:39] <NABrown> can you recommend a good sorting animation plugin instead?
[17:01:55] <stikkemz> hello
[17:03:08] <Dorf_> CorySimmons: you might want to try changing "element" to something else.  it is a reserved word
[17:03:30] <CorySimmons> Dorf_: I suspected that and tried it with el already. Same results.
[17:03:35] <stikkemz> anyone here has any experience with OpenLayers 3?
[17:03:53] <Dorf_> can you put it in a fiddle?
[17:05:13] <ajpiano> CorySimmons you need to return this.each(function(i, element) { }); inside of a jquery plugin
[17:05:36] <CorySimmons> Dorf_: http://jsfiddle.net/8fs63x8s/
[17:05:37] <ajpiano> otherwise you're not inside the actual selected elements loop
[17:05:43] <ajpiano> you're just firing a funcion on nothing
[17:05:53] <ajpiano> you're calling scrollTrigger() with no args, so that's why "element" is undefiend
[17:06:24] <CorySimmons> ajpiano: Thanks, let me work on it
[17:24:04] <CorySimmons> ajpiano: I don't think I understand how "this" works.. http://pastie.org/9992461
[17:24:14] <CorySimmons> Ln 15: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[17:28:33] <CorySimmons> Basically I keep losing access to "this" whenever I nest my function inside of $(window).scroll
[17:28:49] <CorySimmons> "this" because $(window) instead of the instance
[17:28:56] <ajpiano> CorySimmons, cause you're changing the invocation scope
[17:29:01] <ajpiano> simplest thing to do is to alias it
[17:29:03] <ajpiano> var foo = this;
[17:29:10] <ajpiano> sorry i can't get into much more detail now CorySimmons
[17:29:19] <CorySimmons> no problem. thanks for your help
[17:29:29] <ajpiano> got a whole nginx deploy blergin blerg that im tryin to figure out :D
[17:31:19] <CorySimmons> ajpiano: No problem. I think I figured it out. It was just the var foo = this; thing
[17:37:54] <CorySimmons> I got the plugin working for the most part, but I'm not sure why my offset option doesn't actually do anything (the plugin acts as if the offset is always 60). http://pastie.org/9992471 Any ideas anyone?
[17:38:19] <stikkemz> dudes, does anyone here have any experience with OpenLayers3?
[17:41:10] <CorySimmons> stikkemz: Sorry I do not.
[17:42:28] <stikkemz> CorySimmons, yeah, and their channel is basically empty.. so I can`t find anyone to bump some ideas off of..
[17:43:40] <CorySimmons> stikkemz: Is OpenLayers jQuery? Seems like pure JS. Might have better luck in #javascript
[17:45:19] <stikkemz> yeah, tried that too, but most of the people that implement OL3 use jq
[17:48:15] <CorySimmons> irc pretty dead tonight. everyone's at church
[17:53:02] <CorySimmons> Nevermind, ignore my question, I figured it out
[18:59:53] <Talon_> is there a way to have a tabless tab widget controlled by an accordion widget? like vertical tabs but as an accordion so you could sub-section out your tabs.
[19:09:37] <spillere2> on http://dev.danielandrade.net/pdf-downloads/?i=wa2on9la if you enter the email testemail1@gmail.com, it was supposed to slideUp the "verify email" and slideDown another button. Can anyone help me figure out why this isn't working? Its simple hiding and showing the buttons! thanks
[20:56:48] <ancestral> Hey guys
[20:57:17] <ancestral> Anyone know of a mirror for jquery documentation?
[20:57:23] <ancestral> (Since the server is down)
[20:57:51] <ancestral> Or… my search engine is being mean…
[20:58:13] <ancestral> http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[20:59:05] <ancestral> Maybe http://www.jqapi.com?
[20:59:21] <ancestral> Looks like that’ll do
[21:14:56] <AcidRain2012> guys
[21:15:02] <AcidRain2012> i believe im having another retarded moment
[21:15:19] <AcidRain2012> at first i thought it was me doing something stupid, but then i copied the entire page source and its dependencies. and it still doesnts work
[21:15:29] <AcidRain2012> http://www.jqueryrain.com/?uGqxYu1Y   here is the site in question.
[21:16:12] <AcidRain2012> the actual brackets do not show up. i copied page source, and all dependencies listed on this pages source. and changed their paths.
[21:16:17] <AcidRain2012> why would this not work for me?
[21:18:53] <AcidRain2012> you can see the clone here in action: http://jkdf2.net:8080/
[21:18:55] <AcidRain2012> to see what i mean
[21:37:44] <Uhkis> AcidRain2012: your jquery.bracket.min.js is the github page, not the raw file..
[21:39:07] <Uhkis> same goes for the min.css
[21:39:38] <AcidRain2012> Uhkis: as expected. me being retarded
[21:40:43] * AcidRain2012 hides face in shame
[21:57:22] <hesco1> can an ajax call be made to a remote url, that is, from one domain to another?
[21:59:32] <rcyr> hesco1: No unless the other domain gives you the permission.
[21:59:48] <rcyr> (The other domain does that by sending your CORS headers)
[22:02:50] <hesco1> thanks, will look up CORS headers then.
[22:05:50] <hesco1> I want to host an application at a domain I control and have it serve that application to several other domains hosting drupal sites.
[22:28:11] <datazombie> Hi, does the lastest version of jquery support patch method?
[23:25:33] <Cork> datazombie: patch? you mean for ajax?
[23:25:45] <datazombie> Cork: yes
[23:26:04] <Cork> datazombie: patch is just a http verb no special code needed in jquery
[23:26:18] <Cork> just set the type in the ajax call
[23:26:38] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { type: 'patch', data: myData })
[23:26:54] <datazombie> does it matter if its lowercase or uppercase
[23:26:58] <Cork> no
[23:44:55] <datazombie> Cork: have you seen this SyntaxError Unexpected end of input on ajax
[23:45:34] <Cork> ?paste @ data
[23:45:34] <b-ot> data: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:45:37] <Cork> opps
[23:45:38] <Cork> ?paste @ datazombie
[23:45:39] <b-ot> datazombie: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:46:35] <datazombie> Cork: I can post the ajax request the other stuff is ember
[23:47:18] <datazombie> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/hLqqggro/
[23:47:53] <Cork> datazombie: your url isn't a string
[23:48:06] <Cork> it's ' or " not `
[23:48:18] <datazombie> Cork: its a es6 template string
[23:48:40] <Cork> but it isn't supported by most browsers
[23:49:03] <datazombie> I am using a es6 to es5 compiler
[23:49:12] <Cork> ugg
[23:49:24] <Cork> well it might be JSON.stringify(duplicate)
[23:49:32] <Cork> if it isn't you have to grab the compiled js
[23:49:39] <Cork> as you can't know what it is from what you have
[23:49:52] <Cork> (you have to know what the browser actually runs)
[23:50:21] <rcyr> datazombie: If you REALLY want to send json to the server, set the contentType to application/json and processData to false
[23:50:41] <rcyr> By default, jquery is configured to work with form data
[23:50:49] <Cork> rcyr: shouldn't actually matter
[23:51:02] <Cork> as he gives a string, and jquery doesn't do any magic with strings
[23:51:13] <datazombie> I thought I was setting the content-type in the headers object
[23:51:26] <rcyr> Ah oops
[23:51:33] <rcyr> datazombie: I looked too quickly.
[23:51:34] <Cork> datazombie: there is a contentType property
[23:51:46] <rcyr> set processData to false though
[23:51:47] <Cork> and ya you should prob set it to 'application/json'
[23:52:01] <Cork> rcyr: that is actually the header that doesn't matter :)
[23:52:31] <Cork> processData disables the data sniffing
[23:52:46] <Cork> but that is only needed if you give ajax a complex object like FormData
[23:52:57] <Cork> for a string jquery just forwards it
[23:53:12] <Cork> s/header/property/
[23:53:44] <Cork> contentType might be needed depending on if the server cares about the header
