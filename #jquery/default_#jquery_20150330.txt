[00:06:56] <manzoor> How to have a common popup div for all pages in jQuery Mobile? I'm using version 1.4.4, any ideas?
[00:07:30] <manzoor> When I position the <div> as a direct child of <body> then it doesn't popup when I do .popup('open');
[00:42:01] <anli> Is there an event for an element being in view?
[00:42:54] <phiz> you might have to hook into the scroll event
[00:43:23] <anli> I do not have a reference to the parent at the moment
[00:43:29] <anli> Using templates in kendoui autocomplete
[00:48:23] <Cork> anli: no there isn't, you have to calculate the position of the element and compare it to the scrolTop and viewport height
[00:48:40] <anli> I do not have the parent at the moment
[00:48:47] <anli> So I cannot add a scroll handler to it
[00:49:15] <Cork> anli: uh, you have the element, but not the parent??
[00:49:32] <Cork> what's wrong with .parent()?
[00:49:41] <anli> I do not even have the element, its just a piece of html that will play the role of a template
[00:49:49] <Cork> ah
[00:49:57] <Cork> anli: then no there isn't much you can do from that
[00:50:08] <anli> But if I had the element, .parent() could still fail if it was not inserted into the dom yet
[00:50:27] <Cork> yup
[00:50:34] <anli> Maybe I am wrong about not having access to the parent, somewhere in the kendo structures, I may find it
[00:51:02] <Cork> anli: also note that a parent doesn't have to be the scroll offset
[00:51:16] <anli> Oh, ok
[00:51:25] <anli> Is that a positioning thing?
[00:51:34] <Cork> its the closest element with overflow
[00:51:39] <anli> ah, true
[00:51:43] <AssassinsMod> where can i find a list of jquery events?
[00:51:46] <anli> console.log(e.sender.popup.element); is maybe my answer
[00:52:14] <Cork> AssassinsMod: api.jquery.com, but most of them are just normal dom events
[00:52:39] <AssassinsMod> Cork: https://api.jquery.com/category/events/ are these all?
[00:53:46] <Cork> AssassinsMod: check the under groups
[00:54:08] <Cork> also
[00:54:13] <Cork> ?mdn events
[00:54:13] <b-ot> Cork: Event reference | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
[00:54:55] <AssassinsMod> Cork: thanks, anyway i was wondering if there was an event that triggers between the page request and browser's visualization
[00:55:09] <Cork> ?api ready
[00:55:09] <b-ot> Cork: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[00:55:25] <Cork> that isn't really an event though
[00:56:47] <AssassinsMod> well, if I use the .ready() the browser first shows the page and then applies the changes...
[00:57:20] <Cork> AssassinsMod: where are you loading this script?
[00:58:14] <AssassinsMod> you mean if head or body?
[00:58:37] <Cork> in head, end of body, loaded through require.js
[00:58:43] <AssassinsMod> head
[00:58:45] <Cork> loaded through ajax
[00:58:50] <Cork> weird
[00:58:59] <Cork> AssassinsMod: is the html big?
[00:59:02] <AssassinsMod> well, probably it's just a little computation delay
[00:59:19] <Cork> AssassinsMod: what browser are you testing this in?
[00:59:25] <AssassinsMod> Cork: chrome
[00:59:31] <Cork> link?
[00:59:56] <Cork> modern browsers should only show a blank page if anything
[01:00:19] <AssassinsMod> nevermind, i might be an idiot
[01:00:39] <Everie> hey.. for reasons i can't figure out console.log(); stopped outputting to the console in firefox
[01:01:01] <anli> Tada, got the parent
[01:01:03] <Cork> Everie: check so nothing is redefining console.log
[01:01:17] <Everie> how do i check this?
[01:01:31] <Cork> check console.log.toSource()
[01:02:00] <AssassinsMod> Cork: i was working on a chrome extension, and by default chrome chooses a "good time" to inject the script between dom.ready & window.load
[01:02:10] <Cork> Everie: it should be "function () { [native code] }"
[01:02:44] <Cork> AssassinsMod: ah, ya extensions add a third dimension to the load problem :)
[01:04:30] <Everie> could you dumb it down a bit for me? :) .. what goes in what?
[01:04:39] <AssassinsMod> Cork: hopefully setting "document_start" it should go fine
[01:04:56] <Cork> Everie: open the console and run console.log.toSource()
[01:05:00] <Cork> check the string output
[01:05:05] <Everie> ok
[01:06:35] <Everie> alright. so now i get what you meant earier.. it says function log() ..instead of just function () though
[01:06:50] <Cork> oh sorry
[01:06:56] <Cork> no
[01:06:57] <Cork> hmm
[01:07:22] <Cork> Everie: sounds like the page replaces the log function then
[01:07:35] <Everie> alright, so it's a bug in my code somewhere
[01:07:41] <Everie> (as i suspected)
[01:08:16] <Cork> ya, i've seen pages that if it is in production do console.log = function() {}
[01:08:33] <Cork> (a really bad idea)
[01:08:57] <Xatenev> Is there any way to disable all those "has joined.. has left the room etc" ?
[01:09:10] <Cork> Everie: you can do console.log
[01:09:11] <Everie> Xatenev, should be in your client's settings
[01:09:22] <Cork> Everie: and then click the function to jump to where it was defined
[01:09:27] <Xatenev> Everie: hm lemme check
[01:10:08] <Everie> alright Cork, i just did a ctrl+f through the code js file and it seems just about right (to me) though most of the console.log lines have // in front of them
[01:12:09] <frank_o> Hi! Is it a good idea to load "heavy media" (user photos, MP4s etc.) separately via jQuery after page load in order to reduce page loading time? Ie. just render a hidden temp element containing the URL which is then later loaded by jQuery?
[01:13:00] <Cork> frank_o: if the media is in an element in the page it will get loaded as the page loads
[01:13:15] <Cork> frank_o: you would have to inject the html into the page after load to get around that
[01:14:29] <frank_o> Cork: i might be able to get away with just rendering <div class="load_later" style="display: none;">/path/to/media</div> i think?
[01:14:48] <frank_o> Cork: cooked up https://gist.github.com/dt1973/50f826681b92c6e60299 yesterday havent tested it yet though
[01:14:58] <Cork> frank_o: why would you have the url as text in a dom element??
[01:15:16] <Cork> that's just silly
[01:15:52] <Cork> frank_o: optionally you could stor the url as data-attribute on the load_later div
[01:15:55] <Cork> *store
[01:16:05] <Cork> but there isn't a reason to have it as rendered text
[01:17:01] <frank_o> hmm..
[01:17:24] <frank_o> data attr it is then :D
[01:19:31] <frank_o> sorry did i miss anything
[01:22:28] <frank_o> Cork: now using data-url: https://gist.github.com/dt1973/50f826681b92c6e60299
[01:22:28] <_entropy> Q: What do a blonde and your computer have in common? A: You don't know how much either of them mean to you until they go down on you.
[01:22:54] <Cork> frank_o: no, i meant use json arrays
[01:22:54] <_entropy> Q: What does a blonde answer to the question "Are you sexually active?" A: "No, I just lie there."
[01:23:20] <frank_o> oooh..
[01:23:33] <frank_o> hello Omar- :)
[01:23:53] <Cork> frank_o: don't forget to make sure the json is entity escaped
[01:25:37] <Omar-> hi frank_o
[01:25:41] <Omar-> how r u?
[01:25:48] <Omar-> morning Cork
[01:25:58] <frank_o> im great man thanks!
[01:26:39] <Omar-> frank_o how's jqm going? I miss your questions :P
[01:26:47] <frank_o> Cork: so i should render a separate json response from the controller containing the media urls?
[01:26:56] <frank_o> Omar-: thats because you solved them all lol
[01:27:07] <Cork> frank_o: not sure what server language you use
[01:27:19] <Omar-> frank_o haha..I hope so ;)
[01:27:59] <frank_o> Cork: ruby on rails atm.. not sure its worth modifying the backend when i can just as easily get the url via the views as it is
[01:28:16] <frank_o> i know it doesnt look that neat but..
[01:28:23] <Cork> frank_o: then just use content_tag(:div, "", { data: { url: arr } })
[01:29:17] <frank_o> that i could do, yeah
[01:29:52] <frank_o> cool
[01:37:59] <iCC0> i need help with routing jquery ui tabs! http://www.pythonic.se/#settings <-- that should route to Settings tab
[01:40:15] <AssassinsMod> how to disable a handler?
[01:41:17] <Cork> iCC0: you would have to use the tab option and select the tab based on the hash
[01:41:29] <Cork> AssassinsMod: you don't you store a value and check that inside the handler
[01:41:51] <AssassinsMod> Cork: i have an html event handler `oncontextmenu`
[01:41:54] <Cork> ex .on('click', function() { if(!$(this).data('disabled') {} });
[01:43:21] <iCC0> Cork: could you try give example?
[01:44:04] <Cork> iCC0: check what a tag inside the tab bar include the window.location.hash value
[01:44:11] <Cork> and set the index of that with the option
[01:45:57] <nodedfree> hello, does anyone familiar with this console error? >> http://s12.postimg.org/oshf23j8t/console_Problem.png
[01:46:17] <Cork> nodedfree: are you giving html to $()?
[01:46:27] <nodedfree> nope..
[01:46:53] <Cork> well the error comes from sizzle, when it tries to parse a selector
[01:47:00] <Cork> and you give it a selector that it can't parse
[01:47:40] <Cork> alternatively you have html in your javascript that the engine tries to parse
[01:47:44] <nodedfree> i tell you what, there were more like this, occured from duplicates scripts ( jquery for example )
[01:47:54] <nodedfree> now everything is ok.. almost
[01:48:31] <Cork> nodedfree: that error isn't caused by jquery
[01:48:40] <Cork> it is caused by something your doing in your code
[01:49:31] <nodedfree> Cork, ill check it out, thank you

[02:44:48] <negusnegesti> Hello guys, a short question please:
[02:44:49] <negusnegesti> I have a button with "onclick" and I'd like to call a funtion with an event... how can I submit an event.
[02:44:49] <negusnegesti> Here is my source code for that part: http://pastie.org/10062304
[02:44:49] <negusnegesti> THX in advance
[02:45:46] <dimi1947> I cannot understand why find() does not work properly in this code: http://jsbin.com/qudaro/5/ I am trying to get the inputs(which the HTML has)...this the code: $('#week').find('input');
[02:45:57] <negusnegesti> my error: ReferenceError: highlightdays is not defined
[02:47:10] <Cork> dimi1947: there isn't any find or #week in that page
[02:50:06] <kokut> Hello, i need to apply some style to all children of a list except for the first one or the third one, how can i do that?
[02:50:16] <dimi1947> cork  I try to use find() in the console....and there is a div week in that html
[02:50:32] <Cork> kokut: .class > :not(:first-child)
[02:51:46] <Cork> $('#week').find('input')
[02:51:46] <Cork> Object { 0: <input>, 1: <input#from_mond.time>, 2: <input#till.time>, 3: <input>, 4: <input.time>, 5: <input.time>, length: 6, prevObject: Object, context: HTMLDocument â†’ 5, selector: "#week input" }
[02:51:48] <Cork> works fine here
[02:53:05] <dimi1947> yes in my local machone it works....I cannot understand why it does not work in jsbin...give me a second to check something
[02:54:55] <dimi1947> cork...did you run the code in dev tools console or in the jsbin console pane?
[02:55:57] <Cork> dimi1947: the browsers console
[02:56:03] <Agen_Terminator1> Hi guys. I have an autocomplete that works, but now I want to strip any 'and's or ampersands and search for the two strings from the db that contain both elements on either side of the and, etc. just using the AND in mysql. That's fine, I can build the mysql queries in php that are behaving as I like. However, there are circumstaces where there are no results depending on the way you search, e.g.  with a half complet
[02:56:06] <Cork> didn't even know jsbin had one of its own
[02:57:40] <dimi1947> cork...I run it to the browser console too and the only thing I get is an array symbol...[]
[03:05:55] <Cork> dimi1947: also if that situation you don't need to use .find
[03:06:05] <Cork> $('#week input') works the same
[03:12:15] <dimi1947> see for youserlf http://1drv.ms/1DjTb2M
[03:21:27] <dimi1947> anyway that is not so important...what is important is getting the values of all the input elements....I use this code:$('input[type=text]').each(function(index,data) {
[03:21:27] <dimi1947>    var value = $(this).val();
[03:21:27] <dimi1947> console.log(value);
[03:21:27] <dimi1947> });
[03:21:33] <dimi1947> sorry for that
[03:21:36] <dimi1947> $('input[type=text]').each(function(index,data) {
[03:21:36] <dimi1947>    var value = $(this).val();
[03:21:36] <dimi1947> console.log(value);
[03:21:36] <dimi1947> });
[03:21:42] <dimi1947> sorry again
[03:22:42] <dimi1947> the probem with this code is that I do not get only the values of the input element I get also the  HTML
[03:22:56] <dimi1947> I want only the values
[03:23:25] <dimi1947> in a series of input elements
[03:41:15] <Cork> dimi1947: something is really broken with the console/browser you're using
[03:41:48] <thebatu1_> hello, I have a bunch of links with the same class name. how can I retrieve the element that was clicked on ? since they all have the same class name ... please see https://gist.github.com/thebatu/efec510d1aad056b13bf
[03:42:23] <Cork> thebatu1_: "this"
[03:44:03] <dimi1947> forgert about the console for now...I am searching for a code to iterate through the values of input elements
[03:44:18] <Cork> dimi1947: you're doing it
[03:44:25] <Cork> dimi1947: and you should only get the values
[03:45:20] <dimi1947> unfortunately besides tha values I get also the HTML related to this input elements...do you think this also the console's problem?
[03:46:28] <Cork> dimi1947: http://jsfiddle.net/ex2rtssr/
[03:47:15] <dimi1947> thanks...give me a minutes to test something
[03:59:00] <krambiorix> how can i detect a browser open event?
[03:59:58] <arthurvr> krambiorix: What do you mean with a browser open event? load? document ready?
[04:00:22] <krambiorix> arthurvr, when the user opens the browser i want to redirect to the login page
[04:01:01] <arthurvr> When the user opens your site, you mean? You canâ€™t detect a browser opening if your page isnâ€™t loaded.
[04:01:28] <Cork> krambiorix: if you by open mean a restore; you can't
[04:03:01] <krambiorix> hmm any alternatives on this?
[04:03:45] <arthurvr> Itâ€™s still unclear what youâ€™re trying to do
[04:03:55] <Cork> you could have a ping back to the server and check if the session is still alive
[04:04:09] <arthurvr> of if you indeed meant a restore ^
[04:05:09] <krambiorix> Cork,  yes i do that every 3 minutes. So when the user opens (and restores) the browser window the user starts to work but after 3 minutes the user is automatically redirected to login. Not very userfriendly...
[04:05:32] <Cork> krambiorix: so switch that up to make a ping as the page loads
[04:05:38] <Cork> and after that every 3 mins
[04:06:01] <Cork> alternatively you can use websocket (as i do) and then you don't need the pull
[04:06:40] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks!
[04:06:42] <gragg> Hey I'm applying for gsoc on jQuery foundation is this the right place?
[04:07:02] <arthurvr> Hey! I'm a team member and would love to help you out. Can we head over to #jquery-dev?
[04:07:05] <arthurvr> gragg: ^
[04:07:36] <arthurvr> That channel is meant for development
[04:07:50] <gragg> Okay arthurvr see yu there
[04:08:02] <arthurvr> gragg: sure
[04:08:55] <Tumulte> href default action and click are simultaneous, right. Is there a way to wait for the default action to be complete before triggering the click function ?
[04:17:29] <arthurvr> Tumulte: Let me fiddle something for you. Itâ€™s not that difficult, if I understand you right.
[04:24:35] <arthurvr> wtf is jsfiddle broken for some reason. Doesnâ€™t save anything.
[04:25:43] <Cork> arthurvr: worked for me a few mins ago
[04:25:58] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/sta3v32x/
[04:26:07] <arthurvr> hmm super weird everything just goes empty when saving :(
[04:26:29] <Cork> sounds like my experience with jsbin >_>
[04:28:21] <arthurvr> lol
[04:28:55] <Cork> from this we can conclude that online editors has some reliability to ask for
[04:29:22] <arthurvr> Basically every online editor is a PITA, honestly.
[04:29:29] <arthurvr> Vim and nothing else, please :D
[04:29:42] <Cork> :)
[04:30:29] <arthurvr> Itâ€™s a huge challange to make online source code editors by the way. The worst thing to build ever.
[04:30:57] <arthurvr> seriously if you have a week or two: https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin
[04:31:01] <arthurvr> itâ€™s crazy
[04:31:41] <arthurvr> most interesting part is https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/tree/master/public/js/editors
[04:46:03] <kokut> Hello, anyone knows why $('html').css('margin-top', '0px !important'); might not be working?
[04:47:28] <Cork> kokut: you can't have a margin on the outer most element of the page
[04:47:42] <Cork> you might be looking for body?
[04:47:48] <Cork> or padding?
[04:48:11] <kokut> Cork: somehow my website is adding a margin-top: 32px !important to the html element
[04:48:13] <Cork> kokut: also !important has no meaning in inline styles
[04:48:26] <kokut> it's not inline just at the top of the website
[04:48:28] <Cork> kokut: link?
[04:48:46] <Cork> kokut: !important only works in stylesheets
[04:48:51] <Cork> it has no meaning in inline styles
[04:49:02] <kokut> Cork: its in a stylesheet
[04:49:10] <Cork> so if a stylesheet specifies !important it means you can't override it
[04:49:18] <Cork> except removing the rule
[04:49:25] <kokut> probably created by the smart dude that made this wordpress theme
[04:49:33] <Cork> possibly
[04:49:44] <Cork> i suspect its html, body {} though
[04:49:53] <Cork> as it doesn't have an effect on html
[04:50:05] <kokut> nope
[04:50:14] <kokut> yes it does in my chrome
[04:50:30] <kokut> html { margin-top: 32px !important; } line 43
[04:50:37] <kokut> i pm'd u the website
[04:53:42] <kokut> Cork: did u see it?
[04:54:14] <Cork> sending pms without first asking is a bad ida
[04:54:24] <Cork> *idea
[04:54:37] <Cork> especially as i have pm blocked by the server
[04:54:49] <kokut> yea well you asked for the link
[04:55:15] <Cork> * kokut ~ayy@22.Red-83-46-82.dynamicIP.rima-tde.net :is messaging you, and you have umode +g.
[04:55:21] <Cork> not much i can do with that :)
[04:55:48] <kokut> its not "user agent stylesheet", its on the html code
[05:09:00] <dimi1947> cork take a look at this fiddle...https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/n7s6yngs/2/ it is the code you gave me to iterate through the values of inputs...what I want is to  make availabe this value outside the function..
[05:09:39] <dimi1947> I use return but it does not work...when I try to access the variable outside the function I get udefined message
[05:10:36] <Cork> dimi1947: https://jsfiddle.net/n7s6yngs/3/
[05:10:37] <dimi1947> I have never tried before assigning a jquery function to a variable so I can get its return value
[05:10:48] <Cork> bah wrong
[05:11:00] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/n7s6yngs/5/
[05:11:19] <Cork> dimi1947: $.map returns an array of the return values
[05:12:11] <dimi1947> that is what I was to ask you...what is the purpose of map...but you answered
[05:12:55] <Cork> ?api jquery.map

[05:51:23] <Cork> ya?
[05:51:45] <dimi1947> I am trying to targert specific input elements using filter(':even')....where I should place it
[05:51:59] <Cork> before the comma
[05:52:06] <Cork> also you don't need filter
[05:52:12] <Cork> just put it in the selector string
[05:54:48] <dimi1947> how?
[05:55:08] <Cork> uh append it?
[05:55:36] <dimi1947> I am confused
[05:55:41] <dimi1947> sorry
[05:56:45] <Cork> uh, you don't know how to append a string to the end of another string?!?
[05:57:40] <dimi1947> I know how to do that but I cannot understan how this is the solution to what I am asking
[06:01:08] <_granra> Hi, I'm having trouble with .css(). I want to apply translate and rotate to transform but as soon as I add rotate it stops working.
[06:01:11] <_granra> .css('transform', 'translateZ(0) translate(' + this.pos.x + 'em, ' + this.pos.y + 'em) rotateY(' + this.ROTATION + 'deg)');
[06:01:41] <_granra> this is what I'm doing. When looking at the markup it no longer updates the element
[06:01:55] <Cork> _granra: look at the generated string
[06:02:26] <_granra> I tried console logging it to check if it was correct, looked correct
[06:02:50] <micalm> How do I execute an action on tab/window close?
[06:03:00] <Cork> micalm: you can't
[06:03:12] <Cork> you could listen for the beforeunload event
[06:03:16] <Cork> but not all browsers fire it
[06:03:30] <Cork> also note, this fires as links are loaded too
[06:04:03] <micalm> Yeah, that's good actually. I want jsxc to log out of the xmpp server.
[06:04:33] <micalm> I can't seem to get $(window).on('unload/beforeunload', func(){}) to work though.
[06:04:45] <micalm> Cork: ^
[06:04:50] <_granra> Cork: Do you see anything wrong with the string?
[06:04:51] <Cork> replace / with a space
[06:05:06] <Cork> _granra: you haven't given the generated string
[06:05:13] <micalm> Cork: that was pseudocody, there's actually only one of those events there.
[06:05:20] <Cork> _granra: either that or even better, make a jsfiddle
[06:05:44] <Cork> micalm: it should work then
[06:06:14] <micalm> I know. :P
[06:06:28] <Cork> note alert doesn't work in beforeunload
[06:06:33] <Cork> or unload
[06:07:16] <Cork> micalm: also not that when the page unloads network connections get closed
[06:07:53] <micalm> Cork: but are they closed beforeunload?
[06:08:08] <Cork> they close directly after
[06:09:24] <arthurvr> Super small correct: alert doesnâ€™t work in beforeunload in *some* browsers. anyways better to avoid it :D
[06:09:27] <micalm> Cork: some pages display a verification like "you sure m8 coz d8 might not b sv8', how?
[06:09:50] <micalm> I don't need it to always work actually, I just want to clean up at least some dead sessions :P
[06:10:22] <_granra> Cork: this.ROTATION was undefined :P
[06:10:57] <Cork> _granra: what did i say :)
[06:11:05] <Cork> always inspect the generated string
[06:11:21] <Cork> micalm: the best solution is to have the server time them out instead
[06:11:32] <Cork> as you can't depend on the client to tell you
[06:11:45] <Cork> at best you can get ~60-70% of them
[06:12:10] <dimi1947> I have to make a clarification cork....I do not just want to target a specific input....I want to target the even number...that is why I proposed filter in the beginning
[06:12:39] <Cork> dimi1947: filter just let you filter the array $() returns
[06:12:51] <dimi1947> i tried this https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/aq3qe53e/4/ but it does not work
[06:12:56] <Cork> dimi1947: but as you are doing that selection right there, just modify it
[06:13:04] <Cork> there is no need to use .filter here
[06:13:05] <micalm> Cork: I guess you're right. Thanks.
[06:13:54] <dimi1947> ok...then how I will target the even inputs?
[06:14:12] <Cork> uh by adding :even to the selector?
[06:14:43] <dimi1947> I will test..give a minute
[06:14:47] <arthurvr> `api even-selector @ dimi1947
[06:14:47] <b-ot> dimi1947: No matches.
[06:15:00] <arthurvr> stupid b-ot
[06:15:01] <Cork> arthurvr: he already have the selector
[06:15:01] <arthurvr> http://api.jquery.com/even-selector/
[06:15:12] <Cork> he just don't combine them
[06:15:22] <arthurvr> ha. I need to read whole stories instead of sentences :D
[06:15:24] <Cork> $('#week').find('input').filter(':even')
[06:15:38] <arthurvr> thx Cork
[06:16:18] <dimi1947> prepare a fiddle....if you may
[06:16:34] <Cork> ?api selector
[06:16:35] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[06:17:09] <micalm> Cork: well. I should've created a jsfiddle after all... I was missing return in the handler.
[06:17:19] <Cork> dimi1947: https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[06:18:24] <dimi1947> ok....I will do some testing now
[06:18:58] <dimi1947> got it...thanks
[06:23:49] <nikhil_> hi. why does my $(<sel>).onclick(function(){}) not work. it is inside of $(document).ready(function() {])
[06:25:04] <nikhil_> my inline script is here: https://dpaste.de/8zeW nothing is happening when I click the button with id #itemAdd
[06:25:32] <arthurvr> What version of jQuery are you using?
[06:25:36] <Cork> nikhil_: .live has been removed since 1.9
[06:25:44] <arthurvr> ^ exactly
[06:25:46] <nikhil_> Cork, what should I use?
[06:25:56] <Cork> ?api delegate
[06:25:57] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:26:01] <nikhil_> jquery 1.11
[06:26:06] <Cork> read that page (it will link you to .on)
[06:26:16] <Cork> nikhil_: also 'unit_price": <--
[06:26:23] <Cork> you have mixed quotes
[06:26:46] <nikhil_> Cork, i was using .click() and it wasnt working also. why?
[06:27:04] <Cork> nikhil_: as you're trying to use .live i suspect the element doesn't exist yet
[06:27:26] <Cork> nikhil_: but hard to say with just the code snippet
[06:27:36] <nikhil_> Cork, I'm only doing that because i thought because I am rendering the JS on the server
[06:27:41] <nikhil_> click() should work
[06:27:45] <nikhil_> Cork, what do you need?
[06:28:13] <Cork> nikhil_: to start with do console.log($("#itemAdd").length)
[06:28:22] <Cork> run that before the .live line
[06:28:38] <Cork> nikhil_: also note the quote comment i made before
[06:28:42] <nikhil_> Cork, changed it to click, will add that now
[06:28:43] <Cork> the parser will throw at that
[06:28:47] <nikhil_> Cork, quotes fixed
[06:29:03] <Cork> its in several places
[06:29:39] <nikhil_> Cork, noted and fixed
[06:29:55] <nikhil_> Cork, its working now thanks
[06:29:58] <nikhil_> i think it was the quote
[06:30:14] <Cork> nikhil_: always check your browser console
[06:30:28] <Cork> it will give you warnings about things like this
[06:31:11] <nikhil_> Cork, i did check the console but didnt see anything in the log
[06:31:16] <nikhil_> output i mean
[06:31:44] <Cork> ah, it might be cause you had it twice
[06:31:52] <Cork> so it "fixed" the unclosed quote
[06:40:50] <CiE|Work> Sup guys
[06:41:01] <arthurvr> Hey CiE|Work
[06:41:06] <Omar-> hi
[06:41:20] * Omar- waves to arthurvr
[06:41:27] <CiE|Work> I am cloning an element, but i don't want a specific EVENT to be cloned with it. Any way of just removing that specific event? which happens on change
[06:42:20] <Cork> CiE|Work: clone the element and .off the event you don't want
[06:42:28] <CiE|Work> if i do .off('change') it removes any change event, but i don't know what name is given to the event
[06:42:49] <CiE|Work> i have more than one 'change' event
[06:42:58] <Cork> ah, if you have multiple change events, and there isn't a scope
[06:42:59] <CiE|Work> i only want to take of the specific one..
[06:43:06] <Cork> it will be hard doing this
[06:43:09] <CiE|Work> how can i define a scope?
[06:43:22] <Cork> change.<scope name>
[06:43:36] <Cork> .off('.scope name')
[06:43:45] <Cork> or .off('change.scope name')
[06:43:55] <Cork> (space isn't valid in the name)
[06:45:36] <CiE|Work> so i am creating the even like this $('#selectBox').on('change', function(){}) where here do i define the scope
[06:45:50] <Cork> change.<scope name> <--
[06:46:06] <Cork> in the string
[06:46:14] <CiE|Work> ok
[06:46:17] <CiE|Work> will try it thanks
[06:47:58] <CiE|Work> Worked like a charm
[06:48:00] <CiE|Work> thanks guys
[06:48:12] <CiE|Work> spent 4 hrs yesterday tring to figure this out
[06:49:41] <CiE|Work> How can i then turn it back on?
[06:49:55] <CiE|Work> i tried .on('.scopename') and that doesn't do it
[06:50:45] <Cork> CiE|Work: if you .off it it is gone
[06:50:50] <Cork> CiE|Work: you would have to define it again
[06:51:05] <Cork> CiE|Work: if you want to toggle it, it is better to do that with an if case inside the handler
[06:51:18] <CiE|Work> ok
[06:51:20] <CiE|Work> thanks
[06:51:22] <Cork> something like if($(this).data(
[06:51:24] <Cork> ...
[06:51:26] <CiE|Work> i think i don't need it on really
[06:51:31] <Cork> something like if($(this).data('disabled')) {}
[06:51:34] <CiE|Work> just wanted to know how it was done
[07:04:32] <Xatenev> Heya
[07:04:38] <Xatenev> inside a jquery selector, how do i rwite this:
[07:04:43] <arthurvr> Hey Xatenev
[07:05:05] <Xatenev> topicId-regexForANumber-remove
[07:05:13] <Xatenev> as id
[07:05:16] <Xatenev> so for example it should match:
[07:05:20] <Xatenev> <i id="topicId7-remove">
[07:05:25] <Xatenev> <i id="topicId-6-remove">
[07:05:33] <Xatenev> sorry, the first exmaple was wrong, missing the first "-" there...
[07:05:42] <Cork> Xatenev: that is a perfect example of where you should use a class
[07:05:42] <Xatenev> <i id="topicId-12-remove">
[07:05:51] <Xatenev> Yea BUt i dont got a class here and it'll break
[07:05:54] <Cork> <i id="topicId-12-remove" class="remove">
[07:05:59] <Xatenev> well no it wont
[07:06:07] <Xatenev> yea well i will add a class P:
[07:06:10] <Xatenev> probably better
[07:15:03] <Hvk> hello, i found bug with jquery selector dont working propper on safari working fine on chrome and firefox here is example on our page: http://exponex.justmighty.cz/kdo-jsme/timeline/ when you click on firt bottom then first top and then second bottom there is glitch can somebody say its problem of jquery? or i am stupid?
[07:15:15] <Hvk> or its problem of safari?
[07:21:46] <visualshock> How can I make a save button with a spinner or other form of feedback?
[07:36:24] <AdamPDotty> visualshock: Basically replace button with animated gif (f.e.) parallel to sending request. Then again replace it on response.
[07:37:53] <visualshock> AdamPDotty, cool. I have a lot of buttons with the same id, how do I know which one is being clicked?
[07:38:21] <AdamPDotty> you should not have two elements with the same id
[07:38:33] <AdamPDotty> that is one reason it is called id.
[07:39:30] <visualshock> AdamPDotty, true, I will change it to class.
[07:40:06] <AdamPDotty> then you can use an event handler and that gives you the event.target.
[07:42:14] <Xatenev> Heya
[07:42:18] <Xatenev> weird problem with .ajax
[07:42:25] <Xatenev> data: { state: 3 }
[07:42:32] <Xatenev> in my PHP script it says state is 1
[07:42:33] <Xatenev> lol
[07:42:47] <arthurvr> Xatenev: Maybe do a fiddle/jsbin?
[07:42:50] <arthurvr> `paste
[07:42:50] <b-ot> arthurvr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:44:05] <Xatenev> http://jsfiddle.net/anogwr9e/
[07:44:10] <Xatenev> its actually really simple lol
[07:44:16] <visualshock> AdamPDotty, ok I will try that. How do I get the textarea above the button?
[07:44:16] <Xatenev> its just state: 3
[07:44:20] <Xatenev> and i vardump it at the php side
[07:44:29] <Xatenev> this makes no sense
[07:46:54] <AdamPDotty> depends, probably something like button.closest('form').find('textarea');
[07:47:59] <Xatenev> It works now
[07:48:01] <Xatenev> I dunno why.
[07:48:10] <Xatenev> Ive reloaded for the 7th time and it started working
[07:49:12] <arthurvr> in your fiddle: $.ajaxq
[07:49:19] <arthurvr> line 2
[07:49:28] <arthurvr> Xatenev: ^
[07:50:09] <Xatenev> yea thats okay
[07:50:15] <Xatenev> thats a plugin to queue ajax requests
[07:50:26] <Xatenev> it works exactly as $.ajax
[07:50:36] <Xatenev> u just write q and the name parameter hwich is "Filter"
[07:50:40] <Xatenev> all other parameters are exactly the same
[07:51:09] <arthurvr> Xatenev: kk
[07:51:21] <arthurvr> Xatenev: They should really have used another method name
[07:51:28] <arthurvr> Xatenev: Looks like a typo lol
[07:51:55] <Xatenev> xd
[07:52:14] <Xatenev> Probably it was some cache issue with my browser or msth
[07:55:05] <dimi1947> suppose you have 2 input elements,,each having a different ID...and you ckick on them...what code will give us their ID...upon clicking
[07:55:38] <dimi1947> such that when I click this element its specific ID is presented to me
[07:57:42] <dimi1947> it might be vague what I am saying
[07:58:30] <denete> $(<input selector>).on('focus', function(ev){ var x = $(this).attr('id'); });
[07:59:15] <xpheres> hello
[07:59:23] <arthurvr> hey xpheres
[07:59:25] <arthurvr> sup?
[07:59:26] <denete> dimi1947: is that what you're looking for?
[07:59:35] <xpheres> I'm having problems to write a table with a string received from json
[08:00:21] <arthurvr> xpheres: maybe do a fiddle or jsbin? That helps us explain and locate the problem
[08:00:23] <arthurvr> !paste
[08:00:23] <b-ot> arthurvr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:01:06] <dimi1947> give me a second to check...it might be what I am looking for
[08:01:27] <denete> dimi1947: you can use the 'click' event if you're purely wanting to listen for clicks
[08:01:38] <xpheres> yes arthur
[08:01:39] <xpheres> wait
[08:01:57] <dimi1947> denete:I am using the change event
[08:02:05] <arthurvr> xpheres: thanks
[08:02:19] <denete> okay, change wont read clicks
[08:02:31] <denete> change looks at the value
[08:02:58] <dimi1947> the specifc input elements for which the ID I want to know have a drop menu in it
[08:03:22] <xpheres> https://jsfiddle.net/30jyouy8/
[08:05:20] <xpheres> http://jsfiddle.net/xpheres/2oL98qqn/
[08:05:25] <xpheres> I made a new one
[08:05:57] <arthurvr> xpheres: Thatâ€™s pasted code, not a working fiddle :/ Try to make sure we have an idea of how your data looks.
[08:06:05] <xpheres> ok
[08:06:10] <xpheres> give me a second
[08:06:10] <arthurvr> xpheres: :D
[08:06:48] <xpheres> ok, I hope is not a mess, there are many functions there
[08:06:50] <xpheres> http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/assets/javascript/atranslator.js
[08:07:07] <xpheres> http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/translator.html
[08:07:10] <xpheres> the html is there
[08:07:54] <xpheres> I want to get everyword from a textbox and write it in a table, divided by words, each word in a column
[08:08:36] <arthurvr> xpheres: Thatâ€™s a whole app, once again not a reduced fiddle of your problem. http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions (last paragraph ;))
[08:08:46] <xpheres> ah ok arthurvr
[08:08:51] <xpheres> I will try to reduce it and post it
[08:09:34] <arthurvr> xpheres: You rock. Thanks
[08:19:04] <dimi1947> denete take a look at this jsbin http://jsbin.com/qudaro/9/
[08:21:26] <dimi1947> for testing purposes only...when you click in the #from_mond input box(upper left) the from function is trggered....I want in it to have access in the ID of the specifc input box
[08:22:36] <dimi1947> that is backbone code there
[08:33:26] <Xatenev> Heya
[08:33:34] <arthurvr> Hey Xatenev
[08:33:38] <Xatenev> I need some help again :X
[08:33:39] <arthurvr> sup?
[08:33:52] <Xatenev> Its hilariously bad written code, but I have to fix it fast xd, i will make a fiddle
[08:34:27] <arthurvr> Xatenev: Sure.
[08:36:24] <Xatenev> http://jsfiddle.net/8ayn4gy1/1/
[08:36:26] <Xatenev> something like that
[08:36:32] <Xatenev> its rly weird and bad I know..
[08:37:06] <Xatenev> When i have the label text, I want to use it aswell as the id and .append() and item to a div
[08:37:14] <Xatenev> the append is no problem i think, i juts dunno how to get the selector correct ^^
[08:38:36] <decx> huh
[08:39:00] <Xatenev> and my brain is exploding cause im facing retarded errors since the whole day
[08:39:01] <Xatenev> xD
[08:39:15] <decx> you target the input by id and go to the label from there?
[08:39:26] <Xatenev> well the label itself has an id
[08:39:29] <Xatenev> i just wanna get the label attribute
[08:39:31] <Xatenev> by any selector
[08:39:34] <Xatenev> i dont rly care which selector :O
[08:39:41] <decx> attribute selectors are slow
[08:39:42] <Xatenev> ah no it doesnt have an id
[08:39:49] <Xatenev> I just wanna get dat label ><
[08:39:49] <Xatenev> .D
[08:39:54] <Xatenev> i dont care how :D
[08:40:04] <arthurvr> decx: Attribute selectors are relatively not that slow :D
[08:40:35] <arthurvr> In 99% procent of the cases these get in qsa and are really fast, actually.
[08:40:47] <decx> comparatively they are, doesnt really matter for this kind of selecting of course
[08:40:49] <arthurvr> Note the *relatively*
[08:40:54] <Hvk> hello, i found bug with jquery selector dont working propper on safari working fine on chrome and firefox here is example on our page: http://exponex.justmighty.cz/kdo-jsme/timeline/ when you click on firt bottom then first top and then second bottom there is glitch can somebody say its problem of jquery? or i am stupid? its just render on visible screen when is zoomed etc glitch is removed...
[08:41:04] <arthurvr> decx: sure it doesnâ€™t. Just saying
[08:41:12] <decx> i prefer a context when i select by attribute for example
[08:41:20] <Hvk> here is screen https://i.imgur.com/UOkoJoM.png
[08:41:26] <decx> minimize the footprint and all that
[08:41:54] <arthurvr> decx: Attribute selectors always being slow is a myth and I just wanted to make sure to say that ;) If you use them right, they are fast like hell.
[08:42:12] <Xatenev> sOÃŸ
[08:42:12] <Xatenev> .d
[08:42:14] <Xatenev> So? :D
[08:42:16] <Xatenev> what can I do? :p
[08:43:32] <decx> of course you say that arthurvr, jqm relies heavily on attributes ;) /jk with qsa it's all quite similar nowadays
[08:45:17] <decx> Xatenev what's wrong with $('#businessId-3').closest().label()
[08:45:27] <decx> wait
[08:45:29] <decx> what's up with that
[08:45:50] <decx> that pre food brain farting
[08:51:01] <jzaf> Hey
[08:51:54] <jzaf> Where do I learn jQuery the best these days?
[08:52:07] <arthurvr> learn.jquery.com; the official learning center.
[08:52:10] <decx> depends on your level
[08:52:35] <arthurvr> Be sure to bug me when you find issues or suggestions with the learning center. Weâ€™re planning to totally overhaul it.
[08:53:09] <jzaf> arthurvr:Thanks for the tip. What levels I am covered for there .?
[08:54:05] <arthurvr> jzaf: from beginner to advanced. Just look for the articles that interest you.
[08:54:15] <jzaf> thanks arthurvr
[08:54:19] <decx> is there an faq arthurvr?
[08:54:43] <decx> i don't know how often we've linked http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events here ^^
[08:55:03] <arthurvr> decx: There is but quite a beginner one. http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/
[08:55:18] <arthurvr> We actually have a ticket about an explanation about that I guess :D
[08:55:33] <jzaf> kk guys thanks for suggestions everybody I'll get started.
[08:55:36] <decx> yeah it's the thing that comes up the most
[08:55:41] <decx> "my new element doesnt do stuff"
[08:55:49] <arthurvr> lol
[08:59:32] <jppie> Guys quick beginner problem
[08:59:36] <jppie> see code @ http://jsfiddle.net/4qqzpzb7/
[08:59:55] <arthurvr> You used the wrong variable name for your event object.
[09:00:22] <decx> also body is 0 height
[09:00:27] <arthurvr> jppie: If you call the argument `e` you need to call `e.preventDefault()`, not `event.preventDefault()`
[09:00:36] <decx> so even with e.
[09:00:41] <decx> no dice
[09:00:53] <arthurvr> exactly ^
[09:01:17] <jppie> okay so thanks arthurvr decx in my real page there was content in my body so this worked :)
[09:01:30] <jppie> stupid variable names
[09:05:24] <Soopaman> is .on() the "correct way" of implementing non-binding event handlers?
[09:05:34] <robertmaxrees> "non-binding"?
[09:08:00] <Soopaman> I want to be able to match event'd selectors, instead of searching for and binding events to it
[09:08:32] <robertmaxrees> you still have to bind to an element.
[09:08:47] <robertmaxrees> you can bind delegated listeners, but you're still binding to a particular element.
[09:09:18] <Soopaman> i understand having to do a bubble'd container(typically body)
[09:09:42] <Soopaman> just couldn't remember which was the non-memory-consuming implementation anymore
[09:09:52] <Soopaman> .live, .delegte, .on etc etc
[09:09:54] <robertmaxrees> they all consume memory.
[09:10:05] <robertmaxrees> .on() is currently the preferred method of binding all listeners.
[09:10:13] <robertmaxrees> it can do both direct and delegated listeners for you.
[09:11:30] <Soopaman> can i pass in a json of multiple { "selector:event": "funcs" } ?
[09:12:04] <Soopaman> (sorry for the rtfm questions, just trying to see if there is a better implmentation pattern than the one I'm currently using
[09:12:18] <robertmaxrees> could you show us what you're currently doing so we can guide you that way?
[09:26:13] <Soopaman> in a nutshell containingEL.on({ "click": { "sel1": func1, "sel2": func2 }, "keypress": { "sel3": func3, "sel1": func2 } })
[09:28:25] <robertmaxrees> nope.  http://jsfiddle.net/3gc72ssn/ you can do stuff like this.
[09:28:43] <robertmaxrees> though it really sounds like youve some some interesting code organization going on.
[09:39:56] <dimi1947> I am trying to write some jquery code to get the id attribute of an input element...nonetheless what complicates things is that the code must be written in the contex of backbone code...is anyone willinh to help?
[09:40:08] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ dimi1947
[09:40:09] <b-ot> dimi1947: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:40:19] <robertmaxrees> i assume you're in a backbone view?
[09:41:18] <dimi1947> ok here is the objective...accomplished without backbone code-sucesfully http://jsbin.com/powuju/4/
[09:41:51] <dimi1947> and here is the problem with backbone code http://jsbin.com/qudaro/10/
[09:42:20] <dimi1947> just try to select a value/time from the upper left input element
[09:43:01] <robertmaxrees> the from function, right?
[09:43:16] <dimi1947> exactly
[09:43:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/zovanupahi/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:44:47] <dimi1947> I cannot test your code...the from function is NOT called
[09:44:50] <robertmaxrees> because of how backbone works, the 'this' object inside of the view isn't the node.  you have to pass in the event object and look at the target property of it - thats the whole e.target thing.
[09:45:45] <dimi1947> oh
[09:46:21] <dimi1947> yes but in order for what you say is proven we must make the from function to be called and now it is not-i do not why
[09:47:51] <dimi1947> and in general...the plugin attached to these input elements no longer works...it did previously
[09:50:22] <sharonMARIPUSSY> HIâ€¦I am currently creating a phonegap android app and need my images to resize by pinch zoom. I am using jquery UI resizable to currently resize my images but it's not intutituve for touch.
[09:50:31] <sharonMARIPUSSY> here is my gist if anyone could help
[09:50:43] <sharonMARIPUSSY> https://gist.github.com/unoseistres/b0ebedd1a1180b938244
[09:51:23] <decx> sharonMARIPUSSY: http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[09:52:06] <sharonMARIPUSSY> decx: Iâ€™m using that now but I want to pinch zoom not just rezible with the UI resizable element
[09:53:23] <decx> it doesnt do that?
[09:53:28] <decx> i've never used it
[09:53:45] <decx> i use hammer for gestures
[09:55:29] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 I'm pretty sure you can't specify multiple elements for one event binding, as well - i think you have to do #from_mond and #till_mond separately.
[09:55:29] <sharonMARIPUSSY> decx: yeah I tried hammer but itâ€™s proving to be a little pain in the butt :/ I was hoping some native javascript
[09:56:07] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees I fixed it
[09:56:13] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[09:56:21] <decx> what was that pinch zoom that omar- did?
[09:56:31] <decx> somebody got the url?
[09:57:50] <dimi1947> I really do not know...I just copied your code to a jsbin version where the plugin was OK....http://jsbin.com/qudaro/12/
[09:57:54] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/qudaro/12/
[09:58:37] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees do you know backbone?
[09:58:46] <robertmaxrees> enough to do some damage with it.
[09:59:03] <decx> like lifting a heavy object in a jerking motion?
[09:59:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/nujesewibo/1/edit?html,js,output dimi1947
[10:00:16] <dimi1947> var test = $(e.target).attr('id');
[10:00:16] <dimi1947> 			alert(test);
[10:00:24] <robertmaxrees> look at the event bindings.
[10:00:24] <dimi1947> sorry for that
[10:00:38] <dimi1947> what line should I look at?
[10:00:44] <robertmaxrees> the events: property.
[10:00:44] <dimi1947> orient me please
[10:00:50] <robertmaxrees> where you define the handlers.
[10:01:14] <dimi1947> yes...what about it?
[10:01:19] <robertmaxrees> look at what i changed.
[10:02:10] <robertmaxrees> see how it's no longer "change #from_mond,#till_mond ":"from" ?
[10:02:26] <dimi1947> yes why did you make this change?
[10:02:36] <robertmaxrees> because what you had isn't valid.
[10:02:46] <dimi1947> why...it worked OK
[10:02:49] <robertmaxrees> afaik you have to specify each one separately.
[10:02:53] <robertmaxrees> it wasn't working for me.
[10:03:19] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/qudaro/12/   look at it...it works
[10:06:04] <robertmaxrees> weird.  wasn't working for me earlier.
[10:07:36] <robertmaxrees> i stand corrected, you can indeed supply multiple selectors.  my bad!
[10:10:37] <tirengarfio> I'm trying to write a code to preview an image and draw an area on it. So this the code: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2ag3vbk&s=8#.VRmCel1hL7A The problem: when I try to redraw the image (line 143), it says: TypeError: Argument 1 of CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawImage could not be converted to any of: HTMLImageElement, HTMLCanvasElement, HTMLVideoElement. The output of variable "aux" is this: http://tinypic.com/view.php

[10:10:42] <tirengarfio> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2ag3vbk&s=8#.VRmCel1hL7A
[10:11:13] <robertmaxrees> how do you expect us to read those screenshots?
[10:11:23] <tirengarfio> :)
[10:11:57] <tirengarfio> tell me one place to paste it, and I will do it
[10:12:05] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ tirengarfio
[10:12:05] <b-ot> tirengarfio: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:13:28] <tirengarfio> http://jsfiddle.net/tirengarfio/1wjyzebh/
[10:13:45] <tirengarfio> that is the output of console.log(aux)
[10:13:52] <robertmaxrees> give us all of your code.
[10:14:10] <robertmaxrees> you send the same screenshot three times earlier - hard for us to help you with your code if we can't see it.
[10:14:27] <tirengarfio> the code: http://jsfiddle.net/tirengarfio/1rw0z83u/5/
[10:14:59] <testerbit> I'm using ColReorder extension for datatables, and when I reorder a column on the columns breaks. Any idea on what the issue is?
[10:20:40] <newview08> anyone know why an event listener attached to a <a> tag isn't getting called when the tag has it's display set from none to block
[10:21:55] <tirengarfio> robertmaxrees, any idea?
[10:23:14] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i got pulled into other stuff, and i'm not entirely familiar with canvas.  I will point out you have some errors getting thrown to the console in that fiddle, and it looks like you've got some global vars and stuff kicking around that might be part of your problem.
[10:27:53] <visualshock> I have a page with multiple forms. The forms are quite simple, just a textarea and a button. When the user press the button, I want to send an ajax call to a php file with the correct textarea data. How can I get the correct textarea?
[10:28:34] <robertmaxrees> wrap each textarea/button combo in an element that you can then .closest().find()
[10:29:02] <shoky> tirengarfio:  aux = $img[0];    instead of  aux = this;     works better...
[10:30:27] <visualshock> robertmaxrees, an element such as a form?
[10:30:47] <robertmaxrees> sure - or a div or anything, really.
[10:31:28] <visualshock> ok thanks I will try it
[10:32:36] <shoky> tirengarfio: or move the "aux = this" to inside the img load handler
[10:41:13] <visualshock> robertmaxrees, should I call closest find on the button?
[10:43:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9wuu2625/
[10:43:06] <robertmaxrees> visualshock do something like this.
[10:44:10] <robertmaxrees> you could also do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9wuu2625/1/ - this is more fragile and will probably break if you redesign anything.
[10:48:07] <robsco> I'm including jquery inline in my own js file (building a widget so want one single request for clients), what's the preferred way to only "run it" if it's not already in use on the site, what about if they have a different version?  can I somehow keep my inlined jquery separate to what the site already uses?
[10:48:24] <robertmaxrees> not a good idea, robsco
[10:48:43] <arthurvr> actually bad idea, robsco
[10:48:47] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:48:50] <robsco> i had a bad feeling someone would say that
[10:49:01] <robsco> :)
[10:49:03] <arthurvr> ;)
[10:49:03] <robertmaxrees> either build it without the dependency, or have a minimum requirement.
[10:49:21] <robertmaxrees> i've been in that position before, and there are way too many many catches and caveats.  not worth it.
[10:49:35] <robsco> so they will possibly/definitely interfere?
[10:49:38] <visualshock> robertmaxrees, thanks!
[11:05:25] <Tomashe> hey guys there is a way to transform an jquery object into normal object, for example var canvas = $("#mycanvas") into var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas");
[11:05:45] <arthurvr> canvas[0] will get you the first canvas selected.
[11:05:48] <arthurvr> Tomashe: ^
[11:05:52] <robertmaxrees> $('#mycanvas').get(0) will do the same, as well.
[11:06:01] <arthurvr> Yup.
[11:06:07] <Tomashe> thanks guys!
[11:06:10] <Tomashe> helped alot
[11:06:17] <arthurvr> Youâ€™re welcome Tomashe
[11:09:12] <tirengarfio> shoky thanks! worked
[11:41:55] <ronalder> data in success callback returning all data from previous calls with new data from current call instead of just current data: http://jsbin.com/qapijuqibo/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:42:48] <robertmaxrees> is the issue with the ajax call or the code here?
[11:43:05] <ronalder> Definiately the code here
[11:43:28] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the issue?  i'm not seeing the bug.
[11:46:17] <ronalder> robertmaxrees: If i could dynamically add data to jsbin and change the definition of the 3 values paired with the 3 names with change on the second call, this causes not only the new values to be appended, but the old values as well
[11:46:34] <ronalder> they would change*
[11:47:29] <robertmaxrees> so slapping dom[i].dog = 'foo'; after the first appendTo() call?
[11:49:29] <ronalder> robertmaxrees: this is all happening dynamically though many iterations, this isnt something I can manuel do, but do you see the problem? you would think the new values would simply be appended, but for some reason there is still a connection to the old ones
[11:49:43] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what the problem is.
[11:50:09] <robertmaxrees> you're asking me to envision something that apparently can't be envisioned.
[11:50:11] <ronalder> robertmaxrees: ok, 1 minute
[12:10:25] <xpheres> hello everybody
[12:10:33] <arthurvr> xpheres: hi!
[12:11:37] <xpheres> I will try to make the jsfddle to ask for a problem I have to write a table from a json request
[12:14:53] <arthurvr> xpheres: Today I wrote something similar for another guy. Lemme search it back
[12:15:01] <xpheres> ah really
[12:15:02] <xpheres> thanks
[12:16:11] <arthurvr> 1 minute
[12:16:19] <xpheres> yes
[12:16:38] <xpheres> I already make the program show the table I want in php
[12:16:52] <xpheres> the problem is that I'm making a transition to a javascript frontend
[12:18:43] <xpheres> before I make the jsfiddle
[12:18:55] <xpheres> please check the php program to show what I intend to make
[12:19:41] <xpheres> http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/translator.php
[12:19:53] <xpheres> it is a table with 6 rows
[12:20:14] <xpheres> and as much columns as many words are inserted
[12:21:04] <xpheres> I already managed to get with json a translation and messages, but to make this table dynamically is a challenge for me already
[12:23:06] <arthurvr> xpheres: This morning I wrote this for another guy: http://jsbin.com/woqejirodo/1/edit?js,output
[12:23:14] <arthurvr> Feel free to use as a base or as inspiration.
[12:23:17] <xpheres> thanks
[12:23:25] <arthurvr> Iâ€™m not gonna do the whole job for ya, you know :D
[12:23:35] <xpheres> ahaha
[12:23:36] <xpheres> sure
[12:23:41] <xpheres> thanks anyway
[12:23:53] <arthurvr> xpheres: If you have questions, though, feel free to ask.
[12:23:55] <xpheres> yes I've seen something similar already in stackoverflow
[12:23:58] <xpheres> thanks
[12:24:24] <xpheres> well I'm pushing my development limits, I'm just an amateur and learning
[12:24:31] <xpheres> there's no hurry, I'm having fun with it
[12:24:48] <xpheres> I like the code, it seems very simple
[12:24:52] <arthurvr> xpheres: Way to go! Youâ€™re welcome! learn.jquery.com ftw, btw.
[12:24:54] <xpheres> let's see if I'm able to implement it
[12:25:07] <arthurvr> Once you understand how it works youâ€™ll be able to.
[12:25:43] <xpheres> ok
[12:26:01] <xpheres> now I have a problem that is not related to javascript, that I have to solve as well
[12:26:11] <arthurvr> shoot?
[12:26:13] <xpheres> and the problem is, how do I send a bidimensional array to the json?
[12:26:21] <xpheres> because the table is a bidimensional array
[12:26:36] <xpheres> everyword as different fields
[12:26:38] <arthurvr> using basically every json parser
[12:26:43] <xpheres> right...
[12:26:55] <xpheres> I already did that for a one dimensional array
[12:27:01] <xpheres> let's see If I manage to do that
[12:27:11] <arthurvr> just map it over on your back-end (preferably) and json stringify it.
[12:27:22] <xpheres> right...
[12:40:08] <xpheres> arthurvr
[12:40:14] <arthurvr> yo
[12:40:18] <xpheres> I tried to implement your code
[12:40:20] <xpheres> http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/assets/javascript/atranslator.js
[12:40:31] <xpheres> but it's not working
[12:40:44] <xpheres> I think I have to study more about json and jquery
[12:40:47] <arthurvr> That page just returns null too
[12:40:48] <arthurvr> http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/website/php/messagefunction.php
[12:41:12] <xpheres> I added comments to the current writetable functions till I make it works
[12:41:24] <arthurvr> Also I donâ€™t think your table structure will be the same as my example, right?
[12:41:33] <arthurvr> Yeah but this way you canâ€™t test it, huh?
[12:41:35] <xpheres> not exactly
[12:41:37] <xpheres> but almost
[12:41:46] <xpheres> just different number of rows
[12:42:08] <arthurvr> Also, as I said, first try to understand the code then try to implement it. This is basically my code with another url at it.
[12:42:16] <xpheres> ok
[12:42:19] <xpheres> yes
[12:42:28] <arthurvr> If you want I can add some code comments to my fiddle
[12:42:38] <arthurvr> Just to make it easier for you to understand?
[12:42:50] <xpheres> ok
[12:42:50] <arthurvr> The chances are way more likely you will be able to implement it, then.
[12:42:55] <xpheres> that would be great
[12:47:39] <xpheres> I have another small question
[12:48:24] <xpheres> I managed to get asynchronous data with json to a textarea with this : " <textarea id="German" cols="50" rows="5" onblur="Translate(this.value)" onkeyup="Translate(this.value)"></textarea>"
[12:48:45] <xpheres> I wonder how can I make the same outside a textarea... with <div> maybe??
[12:48:46] <arthurvr> xpheres: http://jsbin.com/pabupezeve/1/edit lol
[12:49:06] <xpheres> thanks, that's even more clear
[12:49:23] <arthurvr> You can basically apply these on* attributes to every element, though keyup and blur are gonna be difficult on non-input elements.
[12:50:04] <xpheres> I understand
[12:50:20] <arthurvr> on* attributes are actually really bad practice though.
[12:50:41] <arthurvr> You might be interested in reading up on http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[12:54:37] <arthurvr> xpheres: The same site has interesting articles on ajax: http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[12:58:00] <DobreJoe> Hi, Iâ€™m trying to validate a form. Each field is a li element and inside there are two divs, one for the label and the other for the input. How can I get jQuery validate to display error messages in the label div?
[13:57:42] <hekin> hi, guys, i am using the latest Chrome and jQuery UI - v1.11.2, i found that `mouseenter` is not working properly from my local env and the production env
[13:57:56] <robertmaxrees> show us an example?
[13:58:38] <hekin> let me compose a gist
[13:58:44] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be best.
[14:08:15] <hekin> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/ayjta0h6/1/
[14:08:32] <hekin> weird why the div is not showing itself
[14:08:48] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:09:05] <robertmaxrees> first off, $(document, 'top.frames["topFrame"]').ready(function() { can only be $(document).ready(function() {
[14:09:30] <robertmaxrees> second, top.frames["topFrame"] is not the right way to select using an attribute selector.
[14:11:23] <robertmaxrees> third, $("#target", 'iframe') won't do what you want, either.  https://api.jquery.com/contents/
[14:12:01] <Guddu_> When i do .datepicker({dateFormat: 'dd/mm/yy',regional:'fr'}); i was expecting the months to be shown in French . . . It still continues to be shown in English. Is there more to it?
[14:12:47] <hekin> robertmaxrees: i made some changes https://jsfiddle.net/ayjta0h6/1/
[14:13:31] <robertmaxrees> reread what i said, hekin
[14:14:06] <robertmaxrees> and .load() won't work the way you want, in that case.
[14:18:19] <robertmaxrees> hekin also, that's not how iframe tags work.
[14:18:40] <hekin> robertmaxrees: yeah, i am trying to find out how to add another .html file within Fiddle, :)
[14:18:51] <robertmaxrees> erm.  you don't.
[14:18:59] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual problem you're working with?
[14:19:38] <hekin> the mouseenter works perfectly on my local box, while it's not working that good on my prod env
[14:19:49] <hekin> i am using Ruby on Rails and asset pipeline
[14:19:51] <robertmaxrees> are you using iframes on production?
[14:19:55] <hekin> yeah
[14:19:58] <robertmaxrees> do you have any console errors?
[14:20:02] <hekin> nope
[14:20:14] <robertmaxrees> check out http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[14:20:46] <hekin> will do, thank you
[14:32:25] <hekin> robertmaxrees: i don't understand why it works for my local env but not prod env, you know the js is mangled for the prod env, and that makes nothing but impossible to debug
[14:32:54] <robertmaxrees> your selectors are very unusual and your markup is even more bizarre.
[14:33:07] <hekin> :D
[14:33:08] <robertmaxrees> unless you are actually using iframes the way you're supposed to.
[14:33:22] <hekin> yeah, i do have a src for the iframe i am using for Prod
[14:33:23] <robertmaxrees> this might be a CORS problem.
[14:33:58] <hekin> hmm, i do allow all the requests from different domains
[14:34:20] <robertmaxrees> why are you using iframes here?
[14:35:24] <hekin> hmmm, i want to have another layer on top of the iframe
[14:35:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:39:44] <Guddu_> Could someone help me with this localization question?
[14:39:44] <Guddu_> When i do .datepicker({dateFormat: 'dd/mm/yy',regional:'fr'}); i was expecting the months to be shown in French . . . It still continues to be shown in English. Is there more to it?
[14:39:54] <robertmaxrees> Guddu_ make a fiddle :)
[14:42:49] <Guddu_> In a JSFiddle what is the way to include JQueryUI?
[14:43:12] <robertmaxrees> use jquery 1.9.1
[14:43:44] <Guddu_> Thanks robertmaxrees Here is my Fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/
[14:43:51] <Guddu_> http://jsfiddle.net/7p8wchaq/
[14:44:09] <Guddu_> It shows English when i selected the local to es for example to see Spanish Text
[14:45:02] <illusion> robertmaxrees: Hey you tried to help me earlier, i have made the example of my problem much clearer please look when you get a chance: http://pastebin.com/Kq22e7TE
[14:47:10] <robertmaxrees> Guddu_ that's not what the docs say to do :)
[14:48:13] <Guddu_> robertmaxrees, I tried this too
[14:48:16] <Guddu_> $.datepicker.setDefaults( $.datepicker.regional[ "es" ] );
[14:48:37] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/ui/i18n
[14:48:43] <robertmaxrees> you need to include the localization file, as well.
[14:49:32] <Guddu_> robertmaxrees, It says "The desired localization file should be included after the main datepicker code"
[14:49:33] <Guddu_> Why so?
[14:49:55] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise the jquery ui file would be gigantic.
[14:50:52] <robertmaxrees> illusion you're appending things, not replacing them.
[14:50:59] <robertmaxrees> you're aware of the distinction, right?
[14:51:04] <illusion> robertmaxrees: no
[14:51:14] <illusion> robertmaxrees: how do i replace?
[14:51:19] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery replace
[14:51:19] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .replaceWith() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[14:51:29] <robertmaxrees> there's also a plain .replace()
[14:51:44] <illusion> robertmaxrees: alright, let me try that
[14:52:02] <Guddu_> robertmaxrees, .datepicker({dateFormat: 'dd/mm/yy',regional:'es'}); is still not valid though. I should use the other format right/>
[14:52:13] <robertmaxrees> Guddu_ yes
[14:55:19] <Alittlemurkling> Hello #jquery, I have an issue with a somewhat atypical form validation involving require_from_group and other rules.
[14:55:33] <Alittlemurkling> Here is what I have:
[14:55:34] <Alittlemurkling> http://pastebin.com/a1REGbd9
[14:56:36] <Alittlemurkling> One field is required, but zip and distance must be coupled together to form a valid field.
[14:57:38] <Guddu_> robertmaxrees, Thanks. It works now. one more question though. It possible to make the field non-editable such that the selection of datae is the only possible way to edit its content?
[15:00:50] <illusion> robertmaxrees: Something like this?: http://pastebin.com/HfSWQVYW
[15:01:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:01:01] <Alittlemurkling> I would like for my digits, rangelength, and depends requirements to work reliably. Currently the only two messages that will display are the
[15:01:20] <robertmaxrees> illusion you' want to replace elements, not text.
[15:01:25] <Alittlemurkling> "Please fill at least {0}..." and "Please choose a mile radius".
[15:01:56] <illusion> robertmaxrees: Can't I just replace the text?
[15:02:06] <robertmaxrees> if you want to, i guess.
[15:02:12] <robertmaxrees> read about how to do that in that case
[15:02:22] <robertmaxrees> .text('new text here')
[15:02:28] <illusion> oh
[15:16:43] <illusion> robertmaxrees: thats doesnt seem to fix it, :S thanks a lot for the help though!
[15:17:05] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you're making it too complicated, but OK.
[15:17:11] <illusion> robertmaxrees: probably
[15:18:02] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[15:18:31] <robertmaxrees> we can try to update things to make it reflective of the "real world"
[15:20:36] <illusion> alright, I didnt know that was possible, you can imitate a server sending data? cant imagine how that wouldnt be difficult considering all the frameworks etc
[15:20:42] <robertmaxrees> nonono.
[15:20:53] <robertmaxrees> you're really hung up on an irrelevant bit here.
[15:21:10] <robertmaxrees> though we could, that has nothing to do with your problem.
[15:21:31] <robertmaxrees> you really need to just replace the elements if they're there, otherwise append them.
[15:22:33] <illusion> But given the code, replacing shouldnt be necessary, it creates 4 new elements every time with the new data from the server, I cant believe this isnt working , it seems so straight forward
[15:22:41] <robertmaxrees> that's the issue.
[15:22:45] <robertmaxrees> you're creating new elements.
[15:22:56] <robertmaxrees> those are appending to the document.  which already has the last 4.
[15:23:03] <robertmaxrees> you never get rid of the old ones.
[15:23:47] <illusion> I want the old ones to say, it's a list, each new request from the user pushing another array to the list
[15:23:51] <illusion> stay
[15:24:31] <robertmaxrees> so the first request is 123, and then the second request returns 123456, or just 456?
[15:25:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yxzqqbvo/ this shows the distinction btween appending and replacing btw.
[15:25:33] <ircboss> I have a contenteditable div in my website when a user logs in.  What would be the easiest way to use AJAX to update the database when the user updates the div.
[15:26:14] <illusion> Yeah that second returns 456, the first turns into 123456, the first before the second returns 123, but once the second call happens the first turns in 123456 from 123, and the second is 456
[15:26:28] <Whirled> ircboss, do you want it to update when the edit box loses focus? (i.e user is done editing)
[15:26:41] <robertmaxrees> illusion you're really twisting something up here.
[15:26:47] <ircboss> Yes.
[15:26:59] <robertmaxrees> "the first turns into" - it doesn't turn into anything.
[15:27:19] <robertmaxrees> the requests are independent.  the first request returns 123, the second request returns 456, right?
[15:27:35] <Whirled> then attach a handler to watch  for the blur event on the edit box. Have it call you ajax update funcction
[15:27:49] <robertmaxrees> you could use the change or input events instead.
[15:27:58] <ircboss> OK, thank you Whirled!
[15:28:00] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/saving-contenteditable-content-changes-as-json-with-ajax/
[15:28:02] <robertmaxrees> ircboss
[15:28:11] <robertmaxrees> use this, update the event listener.
[15:28:17] <Whirled> $(".editbox").on("blur", doAjaxUpdate);
[15:28:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd use change personally, but dame diff.
[15:29:14] <ircboss> Is there any difference between blur and change?  Is change called as the content is being changed?
[15:29:33] <ircboss> *triggered not called.
[15:30:19] <robertmaxrees> change fires when the input loses focus if its contents have changed.
[15:30:28] <robertmaxrees> iirc
[15:31:32] <Whirled> for input and text area its deferred until it loses focus. Other elements like select its fired right away.
[15:31:34] <ircboss> Also, is there a way to darken the screen as it's updating and show an spinning updating transparent layer on top of the website?
[15:31:47] <robertmaxrees> ircboss yeah, that's a common thing to do.
[15:31:49] <illusion> robertmaxrees: This is the output after the second call: http://oi58.tinypic.com/rmpgg0.jpg
[15:32:13] <robertmaxrees> illusion ... you still haven't answered my question.  i care about what the server returns.
[15:32:35] <forQuery> for this, jshint is giving an error "objData is already defined"... but as I understand it, the code is correct
[15:32:36] <forQuery>             var objData = $.extend(true, defaults, objData);
[15:32:36] <illusion> robertmaxrees: oh, i thought you said the server isnt the problem?
[15:32:55] <robertmaxrees> illusion i'm trying to explain to you what your actual problem is.
[15:33:12] <illusion> robertmaxrees: ok...
[15:33:17] <Whirled> var may be the problem, forQuery
[15:34:15] <forQuery> above it, I have a method with a function that has
[15:34:19] <forQuery>  dialog: function (objData) {
[15:34:23] <forQuery> which is it's parent.
[15:34:37] <forQuery> Does that mean, that the variable objData is defined by using this, and it's not needed to use var below?
[15:34:51] <Whirled> when using $.extend(true,defaults, objData), it creates the variable...I think
[15:35:08] <forQuery> :) i will try, thank you
[15:35:51] <illusion> robertmaxrees: what the server returns is at the top of the pastebin
[15:36:28] <forQuery> yep that's better
[15:36:30] <forQuery> thank you
[15:36:38] <Whirled> np
[15:37:52] <forQuery> for this one, I thought I had an undertanding of when to comment out in regexp but, it gives error of
[15:38:06] <forQuery> unexpected escaped character '<' in regular expression.
[15:38:11] <forQuery> str = str.replace(/!|@|%|\^|\*|\(|\)|\+|\=|\<|\>|\?|\/|,|\:|\;|\'| |\"|\&|\#|\[|\]|~|$|_/g, "-");
[15:38:44] <Whirled> do you need all those | ?
[15:39:27] <forQuery> well, it does a good job replacing incorrect characters when they pop up
[15:39:33] <Whirled> I think you can just put them in brackets like [@%\^\\+=<>?
[15:40:03] <forQuery> i will read of this, thank you whirled
[15:40:22] <Guddu_> Is it possible to make the Date Picker Input field non-editable such that the selection of date is the only possible way to edit its content and not using keyboard?
[15:42:18] <Whirled> forQuery, there may be an even better way ,but [!@$#%^&*\(\)\-\_\+=?<>] should work.
[15:43:46] <forQuery> oh cool.  Yes, it is called "character map" i believe
[15:43:50] <forQuery> http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html
[15:44:30] <Whirled> you should check out this app called regexbuddy. It is a real lifesaver for regex...
[15:47:40] <forQuery> oh, neat, im going there now
[15:47:55] <drei> hi all
[15:47:58] <drei> Div should not be appending if screen is more then 768px. If the windows is made smaller from the desktop size it works but if you start from the smaller size and drag to the desktop size it is still appending the div - https://jsfiddle.net/rauq4ct8/5/
[15:49:14] <Whirled> drei, what is $(this) referring to in enable tabs()?
[15:50:46] <Whirled> try changing it to $(window).width() instead of $(this)...does that help?
[15:50:46] <drei> Whirled not sure
[15:51:01] <el3> Hi I got a text input in jquery mobile. instead of corner-all I need corner-left or right. But that does not work for me. Has it been removed?
[15:51:05] <drei> that is the js media query
[15:51:44] <drei> thanks Whilred, will try that
[15:51:49] <drei> *WHirled
[15:51:53] <drei> *Whirled
[15:52:00] <Whirled> lol np
[15:52:01] <drei> sorry fat fingers
[15:53:17] <drei> no luck Whirled
[15:53:34] <Whirled> ok. Looking again...
[15:54:14] <drei> what about something like this - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20229204/how-to-append-remove-elements-on-resize-without-duplicating-them
[15:55:22] <Whirled> hey there. I thought this looked familiar...gimme a second
[15:56:09] <drei> can you see in the fiddle what I mean by it's not working when dragged at the desktop size?
[15:56:32] <forQuery> i found this neat site regex101.com/ that shares the difference between regex A, regex B, and regex C.   I made a screenshot comparing the [character map version] results with and without escape slashes, and also original version
[15:56:41] <forQuery>  http://imgur.com/nvRIVxy
[15:56:43] <Whirled> drei, see this is where we have our disconnect. I cannot imagine that every time any event (be it click or resize), you are going to append ALL of your content to the active tab. It just doesn't make any sense to me.
[15:57:26] <forQuery> do you think, new one has a good match to the old one.  Or, do you understand what would be the difference between them, to know which new one is better to use?
[15:59:01] <Whirled> forQuery, what are you trying to do. It might be easier to negate everything like [^a-zA-z0-9] if you just want numbers and letters
[15:59:24] <Whirled> *srry [^a-zA-Z0-9]
[16:00:20] <forQuery> http://imgur.com/S4Do0Fk well, it's part of a "replace incorrect characters function"
[16:02:01] <Whirled> forQuery, the first one has some problems. You have to escape the ( ) and - and _ but not the others
[16:05:01] <forQuery> :) thank you Whirled
[16:10:41] <Whirled> forQuery, look at this: https://jsfiddle.net/hc2Ljkb1/1/
[16:16:14] <forQuery> oh wow that is awesome!
[16:16:29] <forQuery> :) what a cool tool, it will help me test this
[16:16:39] <Whirled> THere are better ways to do it, but that gives you a start.
[16:19:56] <forQuery> do these symbols << or >>> mean anything to anyone?  its one of those last few things google wont let you search (<<< keys)
[16:20:03] <forQuery> return add32(t << i | t >>> 32 - i, n);
[16:20:19] <Whirled> It is used for bitwise operations
[16:20:25] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators
[16:20:25] <forQuery> perfect, i can search from there
[16:20:26] <forQuery> thx
[16:21:14] <jeffmjack> does click() only execute the first time an element is clicked?
[16:21:29] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:21:31] <robertmaxrees> every time.
[16:22:09] <robertmaxrees> forQuery btw asking the same question in two channels like that is kind of sketch ;)
[16:22:10] <jeffmjack> weird, I have two click events - on shows something, the other one hides that thing.... but you can't show it a second time :/
[16:22:25] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle?
[16:24:38] <forQuery> when jshint says "unexpected use of '<<' for bitwise operator above, I think it is error of jshint?
[16:24:56] <robertmaxrees> forQuery that usually means you're abusing bitwise operators.
[16:25:17] <forQuery> yes
[16:28:49] <illusion> robertmaxrees: hey thanks again for the help, i figured it out, it was an obvious mistake
[16:28:54] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[16:29:02] <illusion> How did you just read and type that so fast?
[16:29:20] <illusion> it was like a split second after I pressed enter...
[16:29:30] <robertmaxrees> 4 seconds from my timestamp.
[16:30:05] <robertmaxrees> (i used to do transcription work so i learned to type pretty quickly)
[16:31:10] <illusion> so yeah I was appending the h1's to ".parent", but on the second callback there was already one of them in the document so it was appending the data to both, I just had to append it to the variable name "Parent" instead
[16:31:30] <robertmaxrees> "the variable name "parent" instead"?
[16:31:56] <illusion> "var Parent = $('<div>',{'class':'parent'}).appendTo('body');"
[16:32:26] <robertmaxrees> oh... tht's not working the way you think it is, but OK.
[16:32:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:32:38] <illusion> lol...
[16:32:45] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[16:32:49] <illusion> seems to be...
[16:32:59] <robertmaxrees> err, i already said that derp.  the issue is that normally you don't set vars like that.
[16:33:11] <robertmaxrees> and normally you append to that var before appending it to the body.
[16:33:40] <illusion> does the order really matter derp?
[16:34:50] <robertmaxrees> not neessarily, but it's super hard to most people to read that way.
[16:35:14] <robertmaxrees> because in some cases you can't edit something like that after it's been appended to the p[age.
[16:35:58] <illusion> ill just change it
[16:36:57] <jeffmjack> hmmmm my jsfiddle works, but my code does not
[16:37:43] <jeffmjack> how does one inspect click handler functions in dev tools? via event listeners?  I'm looking there but things seem obscure
[16:39:06] <illusion> robertmaxrees: just tried it "in order" and it stopped appending o_O
[16:39:29] <Tomashe> Hey guys im wondering how do i choose the next element in array and even when i get to the end of the array and nothing after it will come to the next firstone again
[16:39:50] <Whirled> jeffmjack what is the problem?
[16:40:36] <forQuery> for this jshint error, it says I am missing a semicolon... but, i have a semicolon at the end of the statement.
[16:40:40] <forQuery> oArea.stop().css({overflow:'hidden'}).animate({height:0}, function(){jQuery(this).remove()});
[16:41:01] <robertmaxrees> not at the end of all statements.
[16:41:14] <Whirled> Tomashe .animate();
[16:41:24] <Whirled> sorry, forQuery^
[16:41:29] <robertmaxrees> forQuery http://fixee.org/paste/zo84sa3/
[16:41:38] <robertmaxrees> they had the animate call correct.
[16:42:01] <jeffmjack> Whirled: my click event handlers that show/hide something only work once; after it's been hidden, I can't get it to show up again
[16:42:18] <robertmaxrees> define "show/hide"?
[16:42:24] <robertmaxrees> are you removing things?
[16:42:25] <Whirled> did you setup a jsfiddle? jeffmjack
[16:42:32] <jeffmjack> $.show() and $.hide()
[16:42:43] <jeffmjack> here's the (working) jsfiddle that shows the basic idea
[16:42:50] <jeffmjack> http://jsfiddle.net/
[16:42:52] <jeffmjack> er
[16:43:02] <jeffmjack> http://jsfiddle.net/zjxjy7qh/
[16:43:22] <robertmaxrees> have any inline styles or anything?
[16:43:32] <robertmaxrees> are you duplicating IDs on the page?
[16:44:01] <jeffmjack> no and no
[16:44:09] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[16:44:16] <jeffmjack> I'll paste the jquery though so you can see if there's anything fishy
[16:44:30] <jeffmjack> I am grabbing an element by a data-name property
[16:44:44] <jeffmjack> (I wrote this website before I knew about separation of concerns :P  )
[16:45:52] <jeffmjack> here's the actual JS http://jsfiddle.net/3ovdbquh/
[16:46:02] <Whirled> can you cache the item?
[16:46:56] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack which part of this is broken?
[16:47:11] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: there is an uncaught typeError happening in line 4 of my minified JS, of which my app.js is not a part
[16:47:24] <robertmaxrees> then gix that?
[16:47:26] <robertmaxrees> *fix
[16:47:34] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: show/hide only works once
[16:47:50] <forQuery> thx robertmaxress
[16:47:53] <jeffmjack> actually, that's a good point...
[16:48:00] <jeffmjack> but how? It's in minified JS
[16:48:11] <robertmaxrees> fix the non minified version and minify it?
[16:48:16] <jeffmjack> Whirled: like, in localStorage?
[16:48:37] <Whirled> not exactly...
[16:48:38] <jeffmjack> like lint it?
[16:48:50] <jeffmjack> these are like the jQuery libraries
[16:48:50] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack minify and lint are two different things.
[16:48:58] <jeffmjack> stuff that I haven't touched or written
[16:49:06] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack then something else is making a bad call to those libs.
[16:49:10] <jeffmjack> no I mean to find the error in the first place
[16:49:38] <jeffmjack> lint to find the error?
[16:49:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:49:53] <robertmaxrees> ui'm really confused about what you're tlaking about now.
[16:50:17] <jeffmjack> sorry
[16:50:26] <jeffmjack> I'm talking about tracking down the error in the minified JS
[16:50:36] <Whirled> I think the problem has to do with .parents(). If you are searching the parents for the image, and the image is a child element or one of the parents, you'll never find it to show it.
[16:50:41] <jeffmjack> you suggested trying to fix the pretty printed version
[16:50:47] <jeffmjack> I don't even know where to begin
[16:50:48] <jeffmjack> on that
[16:50:57] <jeffmjack> so I was thinking just to run JSLint on it
[16:51:00] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack the minified JS is jquery/other libs, right?
[16:51:11] <jeffmjack> right
[16:51:18] <robertmaxrees> then the error is likely in your code.
[16:51:29] <robertmaxrees> and only emits out of jquery because you're passing something incorrectly.
[16:52:33] <jeffmjack> maybe I should make a more elaborate jsfiddle, with more real code?
[16:52:48] <Whirled> jeffmjack. where is the show function?
[16:53:04] <jeffmjack> line 19
[16:53:08] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack you need to read fixingthesejquery.com
[16:53:18] <robertmaxrees> and pull out a debugger.
[16:53:20] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: will do :)
[16:53:27] <Whirled> so, is .closer and .wide-gif-closer---both .icon classes?
[16:53:38] <robertmaxrees> your issue isn't show/hide, it's your code doing something it shouldn't.
[16:55:52] <Whirled> jeffmjack, just add the html to your fiddle or it's impossible to guess
[16:56:07] <robertmaxrees> something tells me this code isn't the issue.
[16:56:28] <Whirled> I think it's the way he is selecting the image to hide
[16:56:34] <jeffmjack> Whirled: no closer and wide gif closer are nested inside the image that is shown/hidden
[16:56:50] <jeffmjack> the idea was to approximate a finder-like feel but on a website
[16:56:52] <robertmaxrees> he's getting errors to his console that might explain everything.
[16:57:25] <jeffmjack> so there's a small icon, with the .icon class
[16:57:35] <jeffmjack> when you click it, the image, with a nested closer, shows up
[16:57:43] <jeffmjack> if you click the closer on the image it goes away
[16:57:48] <jeffmjack> that all works
[16:58:00] <jeffmjack> then, when you click the .icon again, nothing happens
[16:58:32] <jeffmjack> no errors in the console
[16:58:35] <Whirled> try image.show(200);
[16:58:38] <jeffmjack> when you click and it fails
[16:59:04] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack no offense, but if you can't figure out the bug, why do you think you're able to describe it sufficiently?
[16:59:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:59:29] <Whirled> robertmaxrees, does .show('prop') only use the prop or does it also use display and prop
[16:59:36] <jeffmjack> holy crap Whirled you're right
[16:59:56] <jeffmjack> lol robertmaxrees
[17:00:05] <Whirled> .show('scale',200) only scales the image...it doesn't toggle display.....hide() toggles display
[17:00:06] <robertmaxrees> .show('prop'); isn't a thing afaik.
[17:00:17] <jeffmjack> wouldn't that be an ontological argument against this irc channel?
[17:00:31] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack it's why we ask for fiddles most of the time.
[17:00:46] <robertmaxrees> complete, representative, indicative ones.
[17:00:53] <jeffmjack> i see
[17:01:13] <Whirled> .show(prop) doesn't exist. LOL
[17:01:28] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:01:47] <jeffmjack> it's the jquery-ui show()?
[17:01:52] <jeffmjack> like, it has all these options
[17:02:04] <robertmaxrees> the standard jquery one has plenty of options, too.
[17:02:09] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/show/
[17:02:32] <jeffmjack> but you're right Whirled, I took 'scale' out and now it works
[17:02:43] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui has an enhanced version, as well: http://api.jqueryui.com/show/
[17:02:58] <robertmaxrees> and glad y'all figured it out :) i am way loopy today
[17:03:38] <jeffmjack> so how do I keep the effect and have multiple usage work?
[17:04:29] <Whirled> I do all my own animation, so I don't know .show for ui, sorry.
[17:06:23] <jeffmjack> thanks guys!
[17:09:21] <jeffmjack> this is a non-sequitur, but does anybody else see ðŸ’© every time they look at jsfiddle's favicon?
[17:10:03] <jeffmjack> I"m not trying to disparage their fine product, I'm just sayin
[17:45:21] <cannap> gn8
[18:16:40] <t4nk091> How can i make it so 'on click -> element.target' selects only last element clicked? currently after i clicked several elements and want to make a change to the last one, the change applies to all the previously selected
[18:34:30] <gh0st1> Super quick question: how to send data back to the server in success callback?
[18:38:04] <jqueryius> Hi
[18:38:18] <jqueryius> I am using bootstrap-switch but I just cannot figure out why this isn't working
[18:38:20] <jqueryius>         <input name="s13" type="checkbox" class="s-switch s-task-input" data-indeterminate="true" data-on-text="YES" data-off-text="NO" />
[18:38:31] <jqueryius> I add the data-indeterminate so that it will start as neither Yes or No
[18:38:36] <jqueryius> But it always starts as Yes
[18:38:49] <jqueryius> Here is a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/sumw4/13/
[18:38:54] <jqueryius> but in the jsfiddle it works...
[18:41:42] <gh0st1> jqueryius: no one here thug
[18:50:31] <ircboss> I'm using bootstrap on a website and I want to allow a user to log in and change the order of navbar menu items by dragging and dropping them.  Anyone have an idea how I would go about that?
[19:04:49] <sadtaco> Bah. What's the name of that plugin to make a preview pane and scroll thing on the side like Sublime Text and Visual Studio have?
[19:07:38] <jqueryius> sadtaco: Nano scroller?
[19:08:03] <sadtaco> No. That's just a scroll bar
[19:08:29] <sadtaco> And god damn that site is ugly
[19:09:22] <jqueryius> sadtaco: Is there any quick jquery that will, given the name of $(this) class - select the *next* element of that class?
[19:09:42] <sadtaco> .eq(1)
[19:09:55] <jqueryius> wouldn't that get the 2nd overall?
[19:10:01] <jqueryius> rather than the next one?
[19:11:31] <Insentience> having trouble with making a certain jquery function run when a button is clicked http://pastebin.com/4TP1gH7F
[19:11:48] <sadtaco> .next('.class')
[19:11:48] <Insentience> button displays properly and uses the css i want it to use, but jquery is proving troublesome
[19:16:07] <jqueryius> is there a very broad way to check if an input has changed?
[19:16:22] <jqueryius> like $('input').change(function() {....
[19:16:22] <jqueryius> ?
[19:16:28] <jqueryius> would that work for any input?
[19:17:31] <jqueryius> hmm
[19:17:36] <jqueryius> but that wouldn't include select
[19:17:37] <jqueryius> or button
[19:22:56] <jqueryius> if I have some unknown element with a class "s-switch" inside a div called "s-item"
[19:23:05] <jqueryius> how can I select s-switch?
[19:25:26] <jqueryius> $('.s-item').find('.s-switch')
[19:25:27] <jqueryius> ?
[19:25:49] <jqueryius> the thing is, it's a few levels in
[19:26:01] <jqueryius> there's a few div's between s-item and s-switch
[19:37:24] <ircboss> I'm using bootstrap on a website and I want to allow a user to log in and change the order of navbar menu items by dragging and dropping them.  Anyone have an idea how I would go about that?
[19:51:51] <sadtaco> What's the name of that plugin to make a preview pane and scroll thing on the side like Sublime Text and Visual Studio have?  Or what is that effect called? I can't find it
[19:54:43] <Timer^> Is there a way to keep an element persistently scrolled to the bottom (as new elements are appended), but release the persistence when scrolled manually (up), re-enabling persistence when scrolled back to bottom?
[20:00:21] <sadtaco> ... scrolled to the bottom? I think you mean just like a bottom nav bar?
[20:00:50] <sadtaco> Set an element to position:fixed at the bottom when scrolling down and do whateveryou want when it scrolls up instead
[20:16:50] <jqueryius> if I'm inside a div
[20:16:58] <jqueryius> how can I select that div
[20:17:01] <jqueryius> I know the class name
[20:17:08] <jqueryius> for example, say $(this) is some input field
[20:17:19] <jqueryius> how can I go "up" to the closest div of a certain class?
[20:19:20] <m_zr0> $(this).prev(â€˜.classNameâ€™) maybe?
[20:19:55] <jqueryius> I think $(this).closest('.class'); might work
[20:20:08] <jqueryius> Once I've got that class, how can I get the next one?
[20:20:11] <jqueryius> of that class
[20:26:49] <m_zr0> you would probably want to prove that $(this).closest(â€˜.classâ€™) gets the expected result in console, then experiment with things like $(this).nextAll(â€˜.class:first')
[20:27:06] <m_zr0> but iâ€™m pretty green.  i have to experiment a lot in console to get what i want >_<
[20:27:27] <m_zr0> so personally just try first step, then comment and build on it
[20:27:44] <jqueryius> ok
[20:27:44] <sadtaco> .parent or .closest
[20:27:47] <jqueryius> thanks
[20:28:00] <m_zr0> like thisâ€¦ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1743454/how-to-use-jquery-next-to-select-next-div-by-class
[20:28:32] <m_zr0> https://api.jquery.com/closest/
[20:28:46] <m_zr0> .closest()	 .parents()
[20:28:46] <m_zr0> Begins with the current element	Begins with the parent element
[20:29:31] <m_zr0> so .closest goes up one from (this), and .parents goes up one from (this) and then starts
[20:29:42] <jqueryius> yeah, its working now
[20:29:43] <jqueryius> thank you
[20:29:54] <m_zr0> oh good! np glad to help
[20:49:26] <AliG1000> Hi - I am trying to select some polylines on a map, and then hide them using css.  I have pasted some of my code here:  http://pastebin.com/sKmzefrL\
[20:49:29] <AliG1000> http://pastebin.com/sKmzefrL
[20:51:03] <AliG1000> I feel that it should be something like:$(document).ready(function(){  $("button").click(function(){ $(".segmented_line").toggleClass("segmented_line_hide");});});
[20:51:24] <AliG1000> but I cannot get it to work
[20:53:14] <gh0st1> What am I doing wrong in this basic ajax request callback function? http://pastebin.com/gHKcm7ni
[21:00:16] <jqueryius> say I have a select.change event
[21:00:18] <jqueryius> how can I cancel it
[21:00:23] <jqueryius> ie. from within change, undo it
[21:02:08] <rcyr> gh0st1: You're asking the server for "json" but you get HTML.
[21:02:34] <rcyr> jQuery tries to parse the HTML as if it was json... and, of course, fails.
