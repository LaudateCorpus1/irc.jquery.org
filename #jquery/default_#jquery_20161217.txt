[06:46:06] <Azrael_-> hi
[06:47:00] <Azrael_-> i need to get the json-data from a call with http://myurl?mykey=myval  if i just use getJSON the function 'function( data )' isn't called and if i use the jsonp-callbacks it always runs into error
[06:47:13] <Azrael_-> can you give me a hint/example, how to accomplish this?
[08:03:52] <shoky> Azrael_- if it's a cross-origin request, the server has to explicitly allow it, or you can't do an ajax request to it
[08:13:14] <Azrael_-> shoky: i can see the proper answer in firebug but i can't find a way to access the returned data
[08:15:20] <ilhami> hey.
[08:15:30] <ilhami>  Poll: Table sort "PHP vs  jQuery" ( 500 rows | 6 Columns )
[08:19:57] <Azrael_-> sql
[08:20:20] <shoky> Azrael_-: again, if it's cross-origin and server doesn't explicitly allow it - you can't. EVEN if you can see the data in the devtools - doesn't mean the browser will let you access it from your JS code
[08:21:15] <Azrael_-> ah, ok
[08:21:23] <ilhami> you can proxy it
[08:21:24] <shoky> (because if your JS code can access it, then a bad guy's JS code can also access it)
[08:22:09] <Azrael_-> agreed
[08:24:45] <Azrael_-> thanks for the info, will try it later, currently no more time
[10:31:11] <Deusdeorum> how can i get closest div by class when the class is either 'my-class-1', 'my-class-2' or 'my-class-3'? i'd like to search for 'my-class-'
[10:54:16] <Duikb00t-home> hello
[10:57:16] <Duikb00t-home> I have a question. I have a setup like this:  https://jsfiddle.net/bsmub07v/
[10:57:29] <Duikb00t-home> And I would like to know which element (event.target) I've clicked
[11:03:49] <shoky> Duikb00t-home: `this` is the clicked element
[11:04:09] <Duikb00t-home> shoky:  indeed.
[11:04:49] <shoky> Duikb00t-home: didn't understand the issue, then.. you're already logging the clicked element just fine
[11:04:50] <Duikb00t-home> But I always get 1.
[11:05:02] <shoky> why would there be more than 1?
[11:05:11] <Duikb00t-home> If I clicked the 3rd span I would make sure it's the 3rd one. in the order
[11:05:15] <shoky> you only click one of the spans at a time
[11:05:16] <Duikb00t-home> hmm
[11:05:21] <Duikb00t-home> That's true.
[11:05:45] <shoky> if you click the 3rd one,  `this` would be the 3rd one ;p
[11:06:11] <Duikb00t-home> Hmm but I would like to switch the #render_menu div's content based on the clicked 'span'.
[11:06:24] <Duikb00t-home> Ofcourse the 3rd one would stay the 3d one.
[11:06:30] <shoky> ok?
[11:06:41] <Duikb00t-home> So I have to get a value to 'switch' it on
[11:09:19] <Duikb00t-home> I could add a data-elm="1" to the span?
[11:09:42] <shoky> yep
[11:09:56] <shoky> and read it with $(this).data('elm')
[11:11:09] <Duikb00t-home> sweeeet
[11:20:13] <Duikb00t-home> ok shoky Im further I need now to generate the switch:
[11:20:47] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/bsmub07v/1/
[11:20:52] <Duikb00t-home> This is where I am now.
[12:14:55] <Duikb00t-home> shoky:  Are you still around? :)
[18:22:33] <Captain_Ramius> Hi guys.\
[18:24:55] <Captain_Ramius> How do I use AJAX to run an API call called "Upload" and if it's successful, then record the result in my DB (MySQL)?
[18:25:27] <Captain_Ramius> I'm looking at async: false or success: but not sure which lines up with my sequential idea
[18:42:14] <snover> async: false is wrong 100% of the time
[18:42:24] <snover> did you read the api page on $.ajax?
[18:49:30] <Captain_Ramius> snover, haha. 100% wrong is a pretty serious allegation.
[18:49:41] <Captain_Ramius> I was reading http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ but not sure which setting would do what I wanted.
[18:50:02] <snover> jquery isn’t a database, so it can’t help you with that
[18:50:33] <snover> i mean, it can’t help you with recording results in your database
[18:51:10] <Captain_Ramius> That part is already done.
[18:51:35] <Captain_Ramius> I'm trying to insert a new part that will upload my data via API, make sure it was successful, and THEN run the existing DB write code
[18:52:34] <snover> why does your upload api not do that?
[18:53:12] <Captain_Ramius> The real story is that I'm taking user data, uploading a new listing to eBay, and then recording the user data in my app's DB.
[18:53:41] <Captain_Ramius> If it doesn't upload the listing properly, then I don't want it to save the data.
[18:56:19] <snover> ebay has a cors-enabled api?
[18:58:01] <Captain_Ramius> (quick Google search) I doubt it.
[18:58:41] <snover> so how are you uploading anything to ebay?
[18:59:13] <Captain_Ramius> *I don't know exactly what CORS means.
[18:59:39] <Captain_Ramius> We have a PHP script with an XML template and we fill in with variables from user input.
[18:59:55] <Captain_Ramius> Then we call the eBay URL and send the XML.
[19:00:00] <snover> then that php script should be the thing that is putting data in the database.
[19:00:43] <Captain_Ramius> It is: the AJAX is calling upload-ebay-item.php and then record-ebay-item.php to record it in the DB.
[19:00:56] <Captain_Ramius> Sorry. I didn't mean the AJAX was calling the API directly.
[19:01:29] <snover> you should not rely on the web browser making two requests. your upload-ebay-item.php should be accepting the upload and then recording into the database.
[19:01:42] <Captain_Ramius> the URL in my AJAX call is "/upload-ebay-item.php" which echoes the API response message.
[19:02:04] <Captain_Ramius> So the AJAX URL is simply seeing the text output by the PHP (I hope)
[19:02:46] <snover> ok, that’s great, but also not relevant to what i am saying
[19:03:39] <Captain_Ramius> So instead of 2 jquery AJAX calls, I should chain the actions in the PHP?
[19:03:47] <Captain_Ramius> I honestly didn't consider that option.
[19:03:53] <snover> yes
[19:04:07] * Captain_Ramius is wearing his tunnel vision goggles today.
[19:04:10] <snover> atomicity.
[19:08:22] <Captain_Ramius> (reading definition)
[19:08:46] <Captain_Ramius> So it looks to the User like it's one action but the PHP does it all behind the scenes?
[19:11:10] <Captain_Ramius> Gotta run. Thanks for the help.
[19:11:17] <Captain_Ramius> *Thanks snover
[19:11:24] <snover> yes
[21:22:33] <vladikoff> snover, omg snover, pls send jquery
[21:24:17] <vladikoff> snover, nvm I found v 3.1.1 on the web https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a9cdc4200a86f0f8df6bb8a6d7e17283
[21:25:41] <snover> vladikoff: phew, close one
[21:26:15] <vladikoff> snover, how are things here? same questions ?
[21:26:39] <snover> the questions are the same, the answers are a little different
[21:26:50] <vladikoff> ack
[21:53:40] <ThatWebGuy> How do I push an id and value to an array?
[21:54:21] <sadako> By using an object
[21:54:25] <sadako> not array
[21:56:26] <ThatWebGuy> sadako okay.  How would I go about doing that?
[21:56:50] <sadako> These are javascript very basics, not jquery.
