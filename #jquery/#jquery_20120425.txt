[00:00:33] <Xotix> jrockjiggz: http://tinyw.in/BLrg click show on the last entry but probably I can just use animate
[00:02:18] <jrockjiggz> Xotix: you can use .stop().animate({ left: '0px' });
[00:02:26] <jrockjiggz> brb
[00:03:39] <Xotix> jrockjiggz: chain it to my existing hide()?
[00:03:47] <Xotix> hmm i'll check it out thanks
[00:08:10] <jrockjiggz> Xotix: inside .mousleave replace the line $(this).css... with: $(this).stop().animate({ left: '0px' });
[00:12:59] <Xotix> jrockjiggz: thanks i'll try it using animate
[00:40:15] <sonnie> hi there. here is a jquery-ui question: i use sortable function in my perl code. when a user sorts the list, i hope my perl program can get the new order, how?
[00:41:36] <NodeX> you will have to send a request to your CGI
[00:42:31] <sonnie> okay, thank you. i've got an idea.
[00:43:19] <dobalina> jquery won't conflict with prototype would it?
[00:43:55] <NodeX> not if you use noConflict()
[00:43:56] <NodeX> !
[00:44:01] <NodeX> ?noConflict
[00:45:56] <dobalina> gotcha
[00:46:35] <anli_> I get an InvalidCastException on grid.DataBind
[00:46:36] <anli_> why?
[00:47:29] <anli_> Removing a TemplateColumn removed the error
[00:49:14] <anli_> Aha, got an error when I represented a checkboxed checkstate in an int instead of a bit in the db
[01:02:41] <pneftali> guys - how can I position my autocomplete ul just below the input box by default ?
[01:12:33] <pneftali> guys - how can I position my autocomplete ul just below the input box by default ?
[01:13:49] <stagen> pneftali: with css. Put position:relative; on the input box and absolute on the ul
[01:18:12] <pneftali> stagen: the ul is set by jquery somewhere at the bottom of the page, hidden. while the input element is set somewhere at the top. relative and absolute positioning don't work.. i tried..
[01:18:38] <pneftali> what i see is, by default, the ul element has top: 0 and left: 0
[01:19:00] <stagen> Well then, append it to the back of the input element and position it from then on
[01:19:05] <jrockjiggz> pneftali: have u tried appendTo
[01:19:15] <jrockjiggz> $( ".selector" ).autocomplete({ appendTo: "#someElem" });
[01:20:04] <jrockjiggz> and position
[01:20:05] <jrockjiggz> $( ".selector" ).autocomplete({ position: { my : "right top", at: "right bottom" } });
[01:23:17] <pneftali> jrockjiggz: yap, thanks for the hint :)
[01:29:58] <pneftali> weird, it's not showing
[01:31:16] <pneftali> got it
[01:31:21] <pneftali> thanks guys!
[01:37:57] <jrockjiggz> ff12 is out?
[01:38:34] <coj> dnf is out?
[01:49:15] <johnnny22> how come this doesn't work ? http://jsfiddle.net/LfVnb/3/
[01:49:46] <johnnny22> oups
[01:50:05] <johnnny22> nvm
[01:51:22] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/LfVnb/5/
[01:52:26] <johnnny22> thanks for the little other shorcut ;)
[01:53:05] <jrockjiggz> ;)
[01:53:55] <nFFF> whats with the content.hide() jrockjiggz?
[01:54:03] <nFFF> before its even appended to the DOM?
[01:54:53] <jrockjiggz> that was part of the post
[01:55:01] <nFFF> but the shwo hide is redundant
[01:55:04] <nFFF> it doesnt make sense
[01:55:04] <jrockjiggz> yea
[01:56:22] <jomofcw> Hello :)
[01:56:51] <jomofcw> Using jquery sortable, in update event how could I get the element I just sort ?
[02:01:28] <jomofcw> Please...
[02:02:23] <jrockjiggz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2850961/jquery-ui-sortable-get-the-item-being-sorted
[02:03:17] <jomofcw> Thanks jrockjiggz :).
[02:04:02] <johnnny22> nFFF: what you suggesting instead of doing .hide() ?
[02:04:17] <nFFF> nothing?
[02:04:29] <nFFF> its redundant
[02:04:35] <johnnny22> not even do show() ?
[02:04:42] <nFFF> not even do show
[02:05:04] <johnnny22> but it's so fast, it doesn't even look like something changed :P
[02:05:21] <johnnny22> thought a little anim would be nice
[02:05:23] <nFFF> Im not sure what you mean
[02:05:47] <johnnny22> I want the content to be animated in the page.
[02:06:13] <johnnny22> content is actually just a brief example of what is loaded dynamically.

[02:11:36] <devOlsen> Hey, I got a need for analytic tracking purposes to select different anchors depending on the value of their href. http://jsfiddle.net/nr2BT/15/ problem is that I have to use some kind of exact match, and this fails to select most all of the variations it needs to. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
[02:12:29] <devOlsen> also, they have 47 domains with thousands of links, not logical in the time frame the client needs to sanitize and standardize them, thus this JS solution was explored.
[02:13:30] <jrockjiggz> devOlsen: you can use regex with match http://jsfiddle.net/nr2BT/16/
[02:15:19] <devOlsen> hmm and this would work over the two variations of radio button values above the links in my example?
[02:16:54] <devOlsen> I guess I should say, that if radio 2 is selected (someurl.com/subdir ) it should only highlight links that indeed contain this subdir with in the href and not links with out it.. so just pointing do domain and matching is not going to work.
[02:19:51] <jrockjiggz> devOlsen: my regex isn't good, but this is the idea: http://jsfiddle.net/nr2BT/20/
[02:21:44] <devOlsen> yeah I don't think that will work, you manipulated the values of the inputs to appease the regex, in our real world example, these values will be set in a CMS array and not regex values. I'll keep exploring this a bit further though.
[02:25:53] <jrockjiggz> devOlsen: you can use data attr do host the regex value http://jsfiddle.net/nr2BT/23/
[02:27:49] <devOlsen> oh nice, very close actully. Only problem is, that if the first radio is selected, it should not be highlighting the urls that contain subdir's... this is truly where my problem lives see, needing some kind of exact match, but one that stops just sort of any proceeding text after the match.
[02:28:26] <devOlsen> I'm aware that the reason it matches these is indeed cause of the domain portion in them all, but this is my paradox if you will.
[02:29:03] <jrockjiggz> well, i'm not good with regex, you google a regex generator or visit #regex
[02:46:37] <victorche> hey, i have a problem with droppable :/
[02:46:46] <victorche> can someone take a look at: http://pastebin.com/ZkjVUvkN
[02:48:04] <caleon> what if it wasn't click but mouseup
[02:48:46] <victorche> someone?
[02:51:10] <victorche> i have a table data, each row is draggable... and then the user can drop the row to delete it
[02:51:35] <caleon> so the problem persists if you assign the event handler on mouseup instead of click?
[02:51:54] <victorche> there is a confirmation box for this... Delete? "yes", "no"
[02:51:59] <quicksilver> victorche: the number of alters goes up each time, perhaps?
[02:52:03] <quicksilver> alerts
[02:52:05] <victorche> the problem is... it keeps the id's
[02:52:09] <victorche> yep...
[02:52:11] <quicksilver> because every time your dop function is called
[02:52:18] <quicksilver> you are binding a new handler to ('.no')
[02:52:27] <quicksilver> so it has one handler the first time, then two, then three...
[02:52:31] <victorche> the first alert is Ok
[02:52:42] <victorche> the second... is the problem :/
[02:52:57] <quicksilver> ?one @ victorche
[02:52:57] <bot-t> victorche, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[02:54:07] <victorche> quicksilver: you got it... now I have to read about this .one thing
[02:54:19] <victorche> can you give me an example?
[02:54:38] <quicksilver> $('.no').one('click',function() {.....
[02:56:50] <victorche> quicksilver: thanks! after this code part, I have a... $(.delete).click(function...
[02:56:57] <victorche> the other button, for delete
[02:57:04] <victorche> should it be .one again?
[02:57:39] <quicksilver> probably yes
[02:57:50] <quicksilver> although it's weird to rebind the handlers every time if they're the same
[02:58:02] <quicksilver> (your .no handler wasn't the same since it used the id)
[03:00:33] <victorche> quicksilver, this is the full code:
[03:00:35] <victorche> http://pastebin.com/X3G3jcy9
[03:00:47] <victorche> I just need the id of the row, to pass it
[03:00:52] <victorche> thats all :/
[03:03:25] <victorche> quicksilver, maybe the whole idea is wrong... and... I really have no idea what you mean with "rebind the handlers" :/
[03:03:41] <victorche> sorry if my questions are stupid :/
[03:04:36] <Birliban> hi, is there a shorter way to check if a checkbox is checked than: if($("#foto").is(":checked") == true) ?
[03:04:36] <quicksilver> victorche: you already have a handler on the ".no" button
[03:04:55] <quicksilver> then you bind a new one every time your drop method is called
[03:05:00] <quicksilver> normally you would just bind that once
[03:05:13] <quicksilver> but, in your case, the handler is slightly different each time since it captures the current id
[03:05:19] <quicksilver> mind you there are other ways to do that.
[03:05:25] <quicksilver> I don't know how to explain that in a different way.
[03:05:32] <quicksilver> Birliban: well == true isn't needed.
[03:06:12] <Birliban> ok, so just if($("#foto").is(":checked")) {} will do the job.
[03:06:19] <caleon> if($('#foto:checked').length)
[03:06:21] <victorche> quicksilver: so... my way is not wrong? I mean... I am getting the id and have 2 options... "delete" or "not"
[03:07:14] <Birliban> quicksilver, caleon - Thanks!
[03:13:21] <victorche> quicksilver: or if you could give me an example for those other ways? :/
[03:13:50] <fgro> how can i inspect event handlers in my browser? i.e. using firefox with firebug?
[03:14:03] <quicksilver> victorche: I don't understand what you are asking any more.
[03:14:08] <caleon> $(el).data['events']
[03:14:19] <quicksilver> victorche: didn't .one solve your problem? do you want to understand *why* .one solves your problem?
[03:14:20] <victorche> quicksilver: no problem :) really thanks! it works...
[03:15:04] <victorche> quicksilver: just because you said, there are other (better maybe) ways of doing this... i wanted to learn something :)
[03:15:13] <victorche> quicksilver: anyway... really thanks!
[03:15:53] <fgro> caleon: sorry not really working, i get "undefined"
[03:16:00] <caleon> i think i misused brackets
[03:16:15] <caleon> mighta been $(el).data('events') followed by brackets to access specific handlers
[03:16:46] <fgro> caleon: same result
[03:17:17] <caleon> me too. i am misremembering something
[03:18:30] <caleon> well it seems like i did use it that way. that was the syntax: $(el).data('events')['click'] for instance
[03:18:40] <caleon> where el is substituted by the jquery selector or jquery object of course
[03:20:19] <nomad111> hey all, is anywhere aware of a jquery plugin that will continuously sort a group elements based on a data attribute or something similar?
[03:20:19] <fgro> caleon: yes yes i got that
[03:20:55] <caleon> now i'm confused myself because i recall it worked at one point. maybe there were different libraries at play
[03:21:18] <caleon> ah. ok so it does work but
[03:21:33] <caleon> if it's delegated from a parent element, they show up on the parent, not the delegates
[03:22:05] <caleon> so maybe your events were bound on an outer scope?
[03:22:06] <fgro> caleon: do you have a public example by any chance?
[03:22:39] <caleon> will pm
[03:36:06] <Birliban> hi, i have html5 tag data-x="0012345", when i call it via jquery.data() i just get 12345, without leading zeros, how to fox it?
[03:36:13] <Birliban> *fix! ;-)
[03:36:37] <caleon> $(el).attr('data-x') maybe?
[03:37:51] <Birliban> hmm, no i want to access it via $.data(), it's just an example, in real it's a whole object in that tag.
[03:38:16] <Birliban> see here: http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[03:38:32] <jrockjiggz> Birliban: topics is covered @ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7962464/jquery-data-attribute-removes-leading-zeros
[03:38:47] <shoky> covered in this bug http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7579
[03:38:57] <Birliban> oh great, thanks!
[03:39:07] <shoky> solution is as caleon suggested
[03:39:24] <shoky> or shall i say workaround
[03:39:37] <caleon> you could manually parse the JSON object once you get it in its string format
[03:43:25] <Birliban> shoky, caleon hmm, now I have to overwork dozens of sripts... :-( used this a lot. Thanks anyway
[03:43:30] <caleon> var obj = $.parseJSON($(el).attr('data-x'))
[03:45:16] <eonl> I have the webdeveloper addon for firefox - does anyone know how I can view rendered html?
[03:45:56] <shoky> Birliban go to #jquery-dev and yell at them
[03:46:01] <shoky> or just yell.
[03:48:18] <Birliban> shoky, lol.no, i read the omments in the bugreport... i think yelling won't work anymore :-D But this thing should be better highlighted in the api! :P
[03:48:31] <shoky> ;>
[03:49:00] <shoky> then go open a ticket for the api docs ;>
[03:50:35] <eshlox> console.log(file) > Object { next=null} , how check if file has next? if(file.next) doesnt work..
[03:51:16] <Birliban> shoky, will do ;')
[03:52:12] <shoky> eshlox: if (file.next != null) ?
[03:52:43] <shoky> er your way should work too
[03:52:51] <shoky> depends what u mean
[03:52:56] <shoky> gtg bye
[03:56:31] <eshlox> hm, i get json data, then var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(jsonData); $.each(obj, function(i, file), i want check if file have .next (no difference whether null or some value) then for example console.log(file.next); else console.log(file), but if i try if( file.next !file.next file.next != null etc this alaways print console.log(file), never catch file.next
[04:04:29] <m00ba> Hi, let's say I have a URL, http://archive.org/embed/gd1969-08-16.sbd.gmb.fixed.95918.flac16 , and want to obtain only the JSON list that is found toward the end of the page source of that URL... How might I do this?
[04:05:21] <sunbeam> Can anyone advice me on how i can best create a background-repeat (preferable repeat-x) for this pattern (the dots) ?  http://oi46.tinypic.com/2yobjw7.jpg
[04:05:24] <sunbeam> http://tinypic.com/r/2yobjw7/6
[04:07:43] <Cork> m00ba: you sould have to use a server script
[04:07:48] <Cork> *you would have to
[04:08:20] <m00ba> Cork: there's no other way?
[04:08:26] <quicksilver> Cork: or find and abuse an XSS hole in archive.org :-)
[04:08:54] <Cork> m00ba: no, javascript can't fetch html content from third party domains
[04:09:03] <anli_> I am trying to inject code into javascript with <?=foo?>, but I get a warning: "expected expression", how can I overcome that?
[04:09:10] <anli_> oops, not <?
[04:09:16] <anli_> I am used to php :)
[04:09:22] <anli_> <%= foo %>
[04:09:46] <Cork> anli_: would need to see the code to tell
[04:09:53] <m00ba> Cork: its for a bookmarklet, so that's not an issue :)
[04:10:24] <Cork> m00ba: well if you can get your hand on priviliged js you can run an ajax call
[04:10:38] <Cork> m00ba: but you would still have to regex grep the content of the page
[04:12:26] <anli_> Cork: $("#tabs").tabs({ selectedIndex: <%=selectedIndex %> });
[04:12:29] <anli_> Its js
[04:12:43] <anli_> Inside a $(function() { /* block */ });
[04:12:46] <Cork> and selectedIndex is just a number?
[04:12:48] <m00ba> Cork: I couldn't parse the DOM?
[04:12:50] <anli_> From code behind
[04:12:59] <anli_> yes, its an int
[04:13:01] <Cork> m00ba: not to grab the js
[04:13:15] <Cork> anli_: ruby or .net?
[04:13:18] <anli_> c#
[04:13:21] <anli_> so .net
[04:13:21] <m00ba> I couldn't parse the dom for the only <script> in the <body>?
[04:13:36] <Cork> hmm
[04:13:43] <anli_> Cork: I just realize I ask in the wrong channel
[04:13:52] <anli_> lol :)
[04:13:55] <Cork> :)
[04:14:02] <Cork> can't say i've seen that error so sorry
[04:14:57] <anli_> Cork: Thanks for considering answering :)
[04:17:06] <m00ba> I couldn't parse the dom for the only <script> in the <body>? Cork
[04:17:53] <Cork> m00ba: thats the problem, you don't want to parse the script tag
[04:19:14] <keirlav1987> i've just downloaded a custom jquery ui theme but alot of the styles are default, not what i chose using the themeroller, has this happened to anyone before and if so did they manage to download the correct theme?
[04:19:41] <m00ba> Cork, why not?
[04:20:06] <Cork> m00ba: cause then it will be treated as javascript and not data
[04:20:43] <Cork> hmm
[04:21:00] <Cork> well you could implement the IAP.jwplayer function and grab it from there
[04:21:05] <Cork> thought...
[04:21:10] <Cork> *though
[04:21:11] <scandic> Hey all.
[04:21:50] <Cork> sunbeam: uh.. thats an animated jpg, how do you expect to repeat that when its individual
[04:22:52] <scandic> Someone can tell me how to access (read) custom dom object properties? Example: window > customDataSet > customValue
[04:22:56] <Cork> uh *its animated on a not repetative way
[04:23:30] <arussel> Hi, is it possible to queue the AJAX query on a page so only one at a time is sent to the server ? (the next one being send when the previous is received)
[04:23:37] <Cork> scandic: you shouldn't be using made up element names
[04:23:52] <keirlav1987> and it seems that in firefox the gradient on theme elements negates the background colour, is there any reason why this would happen?
[04:23:54] <Cork> scandic: that said, the dom doesn't care
[04:25:05] <Cork> arussel: sure, just chaing the calls
[04:25:15] <Cork> wait for the success of one call before you do the next
[04:25:20] <scandic> Cork: Ehm… I don't get the point
[04:25:50] <Cork> scandic: if your doing html, you should keep to the valid element names
[04:26:04] <scandic> I don't talk about html at all :)
[04:26:23] <Cork> and the second line is, dom and there by jquery doens't care at all
[04:26:35] <Cork> just use the element name in the query
[04:27:08] <scandic> Sorry, there's no html element related to the property I need to read
[04:27:43] <Cork> properties can't have multi levels
[04:27:46] <arussel> Cork: sure, but I need to create an array to keep the call, check from each sucess/failure that the array is not empty call ... was hoping something was available out of the box (a4j offers that kind of functionnality.
[04:27:48] <Cork> window > customDataSet > customValue isn't posible
[04:28:34] <Cork> arussel: theres plugins that does it
[04:28:42] <Cork> ?.ajaxQueue
[04:28:58] <Cork> ?bah.ajaxQueue
[04:29:00] <Cork> *bah
[04:29:13] <scandic> Cork: So window is the object, customDataSet is the property and customValue is what? It's just the path I see in in the dom inspector
[04:29:16] <arussel> Cork: thanks (I found it :-)
[04:29:36] <Cork> scandic: nothing the dom can address
[04:29:54] <scandic> So there's no way to get it?
[04:30:04] <Cork> theres noway to store it
[04:30:28] <Cork> at least not thats valid for dom objects
[04:30:42] <scandic> hmm...
[04:31:10] <Cork> scandic: an option is to json encode your data
[04:31:41] <Cork> and best would be to use the data- prefix
[04:31:44] <scandic> Cork: I just need to get the values
[04:31:51] <Cork> datacustomer-data-set=""
[04:32:01] <Cork> scandic: whats setting them?
[04:32:19] <Cork> *data-customer-data-set=""
[04:33:07] <scandic> Cork: I don't know what is setting them.
[04:33:18] <kstt> hello, can I bind handlers to events without defining the handler in terms of 'this' ? I don't like using 'this' at all.
[04:33:21] <Cork> what env are you running in?
[04:33:36] <scandic> Cork: Take look at this little screenie: http://s14.directupload.net/images/120425/dbillcrl.png
[04:33:51] <scandic> Cork: I need to get the values and work with them in Greasemonkey
[04:34:12] <Cork> kstt: this is always defined in javascript, use a cached jquery selector if you don't want to use it
[04:34:58] <Cork> scandic: that doesn't look like a dom element at all
[04:35:21] <Cork> more like a js object
[04:35:32] <Cork> so just normal dot notation
[04:35:35] <scandic> Hmm okay...
[04:36:09] <scandic> So window.dataSetForView.relatedCityData.id.value should do the trick?
[04:36:19] <Cork> if its an object ya
[04:37:28] <scandic> Hmm… doesn't work.
[04:38:08] <Cork> wait a min no not id.val
[04:38:12] <Cork> just .id
[04:38:33] <Cork> .value is dom elements
[04:40:00] <Poetro> how do i get the target values for a .animate while the animation is in progress?
[04:43:14] <scandic> Cork: Just get null :(
[04:51:04] <heartofashark> when is it worth it to employ nonces on your websites to protect against XSS? Like, do you really need it for a blog site, or is it usually only neccesary for ecommerce and other sites where users log in?
[04:51:52] <scandic> Cork: Got it working. GM is running in a sandbox and I need to use the unsafeWindow object to access
[04:52:31] <Poetro> heartofashark: whenever user can enter text that will be displayed as HTML
[04:52:42] <Larholm> heartofashark, a nonce is used to protect against XSRF, not XSS
[04:53:14] <Larholm> there's only one solution to XSS; escape your output.
[04:55:47] <heartofashark> Thanks guys!
[04:56:37] <dgx> How come jquery valiadtion plugin adds novalidate='novalidate' and how can i prevent it ?
[04:57:01] <jeffsmykil_> Could someone take a look at this for me (explanation is in the fiddle): http://jsfiddle.net/ZDHrs/
[04:57:21] <Poetro> dgx: why do u bother w/ that?
[04:57:27] <moijk> Hi. I'm fairly new to jquery. I know $(".class") fetch every class="class" in the document. but what if I have a variable and want to fetch something from it?
[04:57:51] <Poetro> moijk: how familiar r u with JavaScript?
[04:57:57] <jeffsmykil_> do "." + variable
[04:57:59] <Cork> moijk: is the variable a jquery object?
[04:58:04] <moijk> cork: yes, it is
[04:58:11] <Cork> ?.find @ moijk
[04:58:11] <bot-t> moijk, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[04:58:22] <moijk> poetro: I'm fairly seasoned in pure javascript.
[04:58:35] <moijk> ah I see
[04:58:36] <Cork> so variable.find('selector')
[04:58:46] <dgx> Poetro: I am testing it out of the box in chrome, just wrote simple $("#form").validate(); and it doesn't work, just doesn't validates. In chrome.
[04:59:41] <moijk> cork: thank you, much appriciated
[04:59:47] <Cork> np
[05:00:18] <jeffsmykil_> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/ZDHrs/ :D
[05:00:40] <Cork> jeffsmykil_?
[05:00:51] <jeffsmykil_> would you mind taking a look?
[05:00:51] <Cork> whats the question
[05:00:57] <jeffsmykil_> oh it is in the fiddl
[05:00:58] <jeffsmykil_> e
[05:01:05] <Cork> uh... no
[05:01:17] <jeffsmykil_> the question is how to make IE behave like ff
[05:01:46] <jeffsmykil_> updated with question mark: http://jsfiddle.net/ZDHrs/1/
[05:01:47] <NodeX> not possible!
[05:01:55] <azk> https://gist.github.com/2489230 am I understanding deferred objects correctly?
[05:02:12] <jeffsmykil_> NodeX: my case, or making IE behave like firefox
[05:02:23] <dgx> oh Poetro: I didn't see that i must specify the 'rules', working now
[05:02:38] <Cork> jeffsmykil_: simplest solution is to use <button></button> instead
[05:02:55] <HardFu> how do I track 'click' event on object that don't yet exist
[05:03:00] <NodeX> making IE behave full stop!
[05:03:03] <HardFu> which is later appended to html
[05:03:09] <Cork> ?.on @ HardFu
[05:03:10] <bot-t> HardFu, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:03:15] <HardFu> tnx
[05:03:18] <Cork> HardFu: check the delegate section
[05:03:24] <jeffsmykil_> Cork: that would take a LOT of recoding
[05:03:34] <HardFu> thanx, I will
[05:03:58] <Cork> jeffsmykil_: well i don't think you can get that solution to work
[05:04:24] <jeffsmykil_> this is most unfortunate
[05:04:37] <jeffsmykil_> it is about to rain great amounts of shit upon my head
[05:05:11] <NodeX> anyone ever seen the box model randomly add 4.5px to an image inside a div?
[05:05:32] <[JK]Shift> @jeffsmykil_ The issue is on FF as well. FF just doesn't show the darkened background
[05:05:41] <HardFu> hm… can't use .on() jQuery version is old
[05:05:42] <Cork> NodeX: line-height
[05:05:52] <Cork> NodeX: set the img to display: block;
[05:06:20] <jeffsmykil_> [JK]Shift: what version of firefox?
[05:06:37] <[JK]Shift> 11.0
[05:06:51] <jeffsmykil_> it looks fine to me in 11
[05:06:52] <jeffsmykil_> hrm
[05:07:04] <raj> what does `var myvar = $()` do?
[05:07:33] <[JK]Shift> Well the issue you mean is the background not applying to the text click in IE correct?
[05:07:51] <jeffsmykil_> corrrect sir
[05:08:04] <jeffsmykil_> when you enter from the side
[05:08:12] <[JK]Shift> That issue is present in FF as well. The link itself isn't active in FF it just doesn
[05:08:13] <NodeX> thank's Cork but what If I dont want display:block .. is there another way ?
[05:08:17] <Cork> raj: create an empty jquery object
[05:08:20] <[JK]Shift> *doesn't show the background as IE does
[05:08:22] <Cork> *creates
[05:08:32] <raj> what's the purpose of that?
[05:08:39] <Cork> NodeX: makre sure theres no space inside the parent element
[05:08:50] <Cork> NodeX: that includes indent and line breaks
[05:08:58] <coachz> hi
[05:09:02] <NodeX> there is none, and nothing is inheriting, display:block fixes it
[05:09:09] <NodeX> and reset css is applied
[05:09:11] <jeffsmykil_> [JK]Shift: I'm very sorry, I'm having difficulties understanding your meaning
[05:09:25] <Cork> NodeX: hmm, man don't really remember of hand right now
[05:09:44] <NodeX> It's been driving me up the wall for months
[05:09:50] <coachz> Does jQuery have a module loader that would let me simply load different css and js files on each page ?  Kind of like this one ?  http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader/
[05:09:56] <NodeX> I have gone up the DOM tree in firebug and nothing inherits lol
[05:10:03] <Cork> :9
[05:10:09] <Cork> its a classical miss
[05:10:21] <Cork> i think everyone that ever uses img hits it at least once
[05:10:35] <[JK]Shift> @jeff, what I mean is I think the issue is with your range for the hitbox. Not very JQuery familiar but experience with general web I do have. The issue is with whatever activates the new background color.
[05:10:56] <jeffsmykil_> hrm
[05:11:05] <NodeX> the image is 64px and the div outside it is 64x68.5 lol
[05:11:09] <jeffsmykil_> [JK]Shift: I have an idea that probably wont work but is worth a try
[05:12:21] <Cork> NodeX: or right
[05:12:34] <Cork> NodeX: you could try vertical-align
[05:12:44] <Cork> i THINK the image aligns with text-bottom
[05:12:53] <Cork> so you get the space from text-bottom to bottom below it
[05:13:10] <Cork> *oh right
[05:13:26] <Cork> so try align middle or align bottom
[05:13:31] <NodeX> text-bottom gives it all but 1px
[05:13:39] <NodeX> 64x64 !
[05:13:44] <NodeX> 64x65 ! *
[05:13:55] <NodeX> bottom works fine
[05:14:15] <Cork> heh skraping up old memories XD
[05:14:35] <NodeX> thanks dude, much appreciated, I'm not sure why the reset didn't fix it
[05:15:04] <Cork> NodeX: you mean reset css?
[05:15:12] <NodeX> yer
[05:15:19] <Cork> you normally want the img align
[05:15:32] <Cork> else it looks like inline images hang below the text
[05:17:09] <jeffsmykil_> [JK]Shift: I suppose my other option is to make them not hover in IE
[05:18:14] <[JK]Shift> @jeffsmykil_ Any possibility of just using a combination of CSS with the JQuery for the hovering effects or is there some special reason you need it laid out the way it is?
[05:18:55] <jeffsmykil_> [JK]Shift: it is already pervasive in the site like this and it didn't get caught until it reached QA
[05:19:42] <jeffsmykil_> i could try not using hover
[05:21:30] <victorche> @quicksilver, are you there?
[05:22:04] <jeffsmykil_> [JK]Shift: this may work http://jsfiddle.net/ZDHrs/6/
[05:22:51] <victorche> the .one solution does not work anyway... :/
[05:23:00] <victorche> that's why I am here again
[05:23:56] <rezas_> Hi all, do wildcards work with id's? e.g. jq("#job_ratin*").on('change', function(){......}
[05:24:01] <Cork> victorche: what are you trying to do?
[05:24:12] <Cork> rezas_: no, use a class
[05:24:32] <coachz> Are there any strategies to conditionally load css and js files on pages?  Currently we have one header.php file that just loads everything for every page regardless of whether it's used or not.  Some files are always needed and some are not like this:  http://pastebin.com/LLTb7GbK
[05:24:38] <rezas_> Cork: ok thanks
[05:24:45] <[JK]Shift> @jeff heh I was just about to edit the events myself but yes, it seems to work now.
[05:25:08] <coachz> and on new pages i want to load the latest jQuery and still load the old version on old pages till I test them
[05:25:21] <Cork> coachz: check require.js
[05:25:40] <Cork> coachz: though concating the js and css files to two files would prob save more
[05:26:20] <jeffsmykil_> ugh does anyone use VMWare Fusion?
[05:26:24] <coachz> i'm not trying to save size so much as only load modules needed for each page and have the option of which jQuery version to use
[05:26:28] <jackfranklin> yes jeffsmykil_  I do
[05:26:47] <coachz> require.js looks interesting
[05:26:48] <jeffsmykil_> jackfranklin: 3 or 4?
[05:26:56] <jackfranklin> I think I'm still on 3
[05:26:58] <coachz> thanks
[05:27:06] <jeffsmykil_> jackfranklin: do you use unity mode?
[05:27:15] <jackfranklin> no I don't
[05:27:28] <jackfranklin> I found unity mode seems to kill my mac whereas keeping it all in a single window doesnt
[05:27:38] <jeffsmykil_> yeah its super janky
[05:27:46] <jeffsmykil_> and I have a ton of ram and a decent video card
[05:28:44] <jeffsmykil_> I wonder if it is usable for anyone
[05:28:54] <jeffsmykil_> jackfranklin: are you running multiple monitors?
[05:29:00] <jackfranklin> yep
[05:29:10] <jeffsmykil_> maybe that has something to do with it I am too
[05:29:32] <victorche> Cork: this is my code:
[05:29:35] <victorche> http://pastebin.com/BVuh9u0j
[05:30:12] <victorche> Cork: this is a table data, every row has an id... I have drad and drop to delete
[05:30:30] <coachz> are there alternatives to require.js or is that the most mature one ?
[05:30:46] <jeffsmykil_> jackfranklin: single window mode makes me feel to cramped :/  I have to have Visual Studio open all the time
[05:30:59] <victorche> Cork: so I need the id of the row, to delete... The delete is made after a confirmation box, with 2 options... "delete", "no"
[05:31:23] <Cork> coachz: concat the js and css files server side and only load two files when the page loads
[05:31:24] <jackfranklin> jeffsmykil_ that sucks :( VMWare generally isnt a great piece of software i found
[05:31:27] <jackfranklin> you could try Parallels
[05:31:30] <eldjb> is a select's change not firing expected behavior when setting it's val() w/jquery
[05:31:38] <jeffsmykil_> jackfranklin: I have it is worse
[05:31:44] <jackfranklin> ah
[05:31:44] <Cork> coachz: that most likly will save you more then any js based management system can
[05:31:44] <coachz> two files being require.js and the concat js/css  file ?
[05:31:53] <Cork> no
[05:31:56] <victorche> Cork: the problem is... if I drad several times, with pressing "no"... the id is kept, so finaly it is deleting more than one rows :/
[05:32:16] <jeffsmykil_> jackfranklin: or last time i used it it was
[05:32:21] <Cork> coachz: concat your js files into scripts.js (or what ever) and styles into style.css
[05:32:42] <Cork> coachz: so there is only one script and one style file to load
[05:32:56] <jeffsmykil_> jackfranklin: you ever use both monitors in windows and then it goes to sleep and wakes up and they are mirroring instead of spanning?
[05:32:59] <Cork> coachz: then you can relay on the users cache to keep most of the page loads fast
[05:33:07] <coachz> that would be good if i used the same ones on every page.   this is what we currently do  http://pastebin.com/phLSS2Gu
[05:33:25] <coachz> so i think require.js will let me only load what's needed for each page
[05:33:25] <m00ba> does jquery have a good regex find/replace function?
[05:33:30] <m00ba> for multiline strings?
[05:33:37] <coachz> might be a great solution
[05:33:39] <eldjb> http://jsfiddle.net/waKWz/
[05:34:13] <victorche> hah... anyone?
[05:34:30] <Cork> victorche: several times?
[05:34:46] <Cork> you mean the onl listner?
[05:34:53] <Cork> * .on listner
[05:35:29] <victorche> Cork: i am not so good in this :/ I mean... If I drag a row and then cancel with the ".no" button... the id is remembered
[05:35:52] <Cork> ah, you need to clear your listners
[05:35:55] <victorche> Cork: please see the comments in the code
[05:36:18] <victorche> Cork: another user here suggested to use .one
[05:36:21] <Cork> victorche: i have a problem with the code thought
[05:36:31] <Cork> victorche: whats the .on and .delete?
[05:36:42] <Cork> are they one button for all the elements?
[05:36:48] <victorche> a confirm box (modal window)
[05:37:05] <Cork> so they'r in the #confirm element?
[05:37:35] <victorche> something like "Delete?" and 2 buttons... ".no" for cancel, ".delete" for delete
[05:37:35] <jackfranklin> jeffsmykil_ no I've never done that
[05:37:36] <Cork> victorche: so they'r in the #confirm element? <--
[05:37:37] <jackfranklin> jeffsmykil_ I never use VMWare for more than IE testing *shudder* so a single window on my laptop monitor is enough for me
[05:37:46] <victorche> Cork: yes, #confirm is the modal window
[05:37:46] <victorche> with 2 buttons
[05:39:15] <ner0x> Any jstree gurus in here?
[05:39:19] <jeffsmykil_> jackfranklin: http://cloudfront.bostinno.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/I-dont-always-test-my-code-but-when-I-do-I-do-it-in-production.jpg
[05:41:24] <Cork> victorche: ok
[05:41:26] <Cork> victorche: you should do this: skip the one listner
[05:41:28] <Cork> victorche: when you bind the listners use a namespace
[05:41:29] <victorche> Cork: thanks but... as i said, i am not so good in this :/
[05:41:30] <Cork> $('.on').bind('click.confirm', function() {})
[05:41:30] <Cork> same with delete
[05:41:33] <victorche> Cork: can you be more... specific? :/
[05:41:33] <Cork> then run $('.on, .delege').unbind('.confirm') as the first thing you do in the event handlers
[05:41:33] <Cork> can't be much more specific then that :)
[05:41:34] <victorche> Cork: thanks... will try to understand your words now :)
[05:41:52] <victorche> Cork: what do you mean by namespace? :/
[05:42:14] <Cork> victorche: the .<something> after the event name in bind/unbind
[05:42:23] <Cork> in my example .confirm
[05:42:45] <victorche> but "confirm" is... id
[05:42:48] <victorche> like #confirm
[05:42:54] <Cork> no
[05:43:05] <Cork> bind('click') binds a click listner
[05:43:18] <Cork> bind('click.confirm') binds a click listner with a namespace of confirm
[05:43:36] <Cork> you can then run unbind('click.confirm') or unbind('.confirm') and only remove that
[05:43:51] <victorche> Cork: should I then change it to class="confirm"? sorry if my questions are stupid :/
[05:44:05] <Cork> victorche: it has nothing to do with id or class
[05:44:08] <Cork> its not a selector
[05:44:23] <Cork> its a namespace for the event
[05:44:40] <victorche> i see... or i think so :)
[05:44:45] <victorche> let me try it :)
[05:45:11] <Cork> victorche: its so if you bind something else on that button that you don't want to unbind randomly
[05:45:14] <Cork> this one won't affect it
[05:48:15] <Jon47> or you could bind to multiple events for a singe feature, and then remove them all in one fell swoop
[05:48:16] <AnaRita> hello, can someone help me on this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10260342/using-jquery-localize-for-bilingual-shopify-store. Thank you
[05:49:43] <victorche> Cork: not working :/ the ".no" button (for cancel) is not even clickable... I mean, I click it with no success
[05:51:40] <victorche> Cork: this is the new one... http://pastebin.com/ZRgHApaY
[05:53:44] <Cork> victorche: http://pastebin.com/b33pgafR
[05:56:50] <victorche> Cork: thanks for this... now the buttons are acting normal, but I can not delete anything :/
[05:57:24] <Cork> you mean the delete button doesn't work?
[05:58:32] <victorche> Cork: my mistake... i forgot the "e"... function(e), so preventDefault now works :/
[05:58:36] <victorche> sorry :)
[05:58:40] <Cork> lol
[05:58:41] <victorche> it works great now...
[05:58:46] <`poo> azk change this 'endkey: endkey_var,'   to this:   endkey: endkey_var)

[06:00:00] <rohanrhu> what is your idea for qooxdoo? do i must try it?
[06:00:10] <victorche> Cork: one last question... I have to unbind for both buttons, no matter when? I mean... in both cases I should do $('.no, .delete').unbind
[06:00:37] <Cork> victorche: yes cause if you click one or the other you want both to reset
[06:00:50] <victorche> yes :)
[06:00:56] <victorche> Cork: big thanks!

[06:21:23] <renobird> Hello all.  Does submit() send post data the same way regular form submit does?  I'm having trouble accessing post data via PHP on the processing page.
[06:21:52] <timing> renobird: you have to do $.post() and serialize the form
[06:22:14] <timing> renobird: sorry thought you wanted to do ajax, never mind
[06:22:18] <m00ba> timing, so check i out... http://archive.org/embed/gd1969-08-16.sbd.gmb.fixed.95918.flac16?playlist=1 and http://jsfiddle.net/va8qt/2/
[06:22:20] <timing> renobird: I think it should be the same
[06:22:27] <renobird> timing: thought that was just ajax?
[06:22:35] <timing> renobird: yes, my bad
[06:22:38] <m00ba> I want to get all the file urls into an array.
[06:22:40] <renobird> timing: slow typing on my part...

[06:23:10] <renobird> timing: thanks.  OK, I'll do some further exploration.
[06:23:50] <m00ba> timing, i'm making a downloader bookmarklet for certain concerts which don't "allow" downloading.
[06:24:36] <m00ba> what's the next step, timing?
[06:26:06] <m00ba> timing, does what im trying to do make any sense?
[06:27:18] <Carlitta87> hi...currently trying to add multiple acordions on one page to be incremented by the click of a button....but im concerned with how to add the data....how wud i add each field to the database if i used jquery to create multiple sections
[06:28:07] <timing> m00ba: I have no clue what you want to do
[06:28:18] <timing> m00ba: just say what you want
[06:28:31] <AnaRita_> sorry for the repost. bad weather in Lisbon is taking electricity on and off: i'm stuck; is jquery-localize capable of what i ask here: http://bit.ly/K9RSl6, or should I look elsewhere?
[06:30:03] <m00ba> timing, are you at all familiar with archive.org? they're registered as a national library and offer lots of free content - notably, a huge library of bootlegged concerts, some of which are "only" available for streaming, not downloading.  I'm creating a bookmarklet to download those concerts for which no download link is provided.
[06:30:42] <I3ooI3oo> Sounds like you are cheating m00ba
[06:31:08] <m00ba> timing, the file URIs are provided in JSON on the embed pages...  so take http://archive.org/details/gd69-04-25.sbd.2596.sbeok.shnf for instance...
[06:31:48] <m00ba> I3ooI3oo, I'd say I'm liberating the data from an evil DRM scheme.
[06:31:56] <omnipotent1> anyone know if it's possible to rotate a background image clockwise, etc?
[06:32:46] <m00ba> if you replace details with embed in the URL, you get http://archive.org/embed/gd69-04-25.sbd.2596.sbeok.shnf , which provides a file listing in json.
[06:33:35] <m00ba> make any sense, timing ?

[06:56:59] <gho5t> when you guys create widgets, do you always append the widget name to all of your classes or do you think it's usually a waste of bytes? e.g. <div class="my-widget"> <div class="my-widget-titlebar">Title</div> </div>
[07:06:14] <raj> gho5t, it's good not to poop in the namespace, that way 'titlebar' can be used again
[07:06:59] <danzik17> gho5t: the classes should be unique enough so that there's not clashes with other widgets, and imo should be able to identify your widget's components
[07:07:48] <gho5t> I guess it's not really a good idea to count on other devs to namespace their widget classes
[07:08:00] <gho5t> e.g. .my-other-widget .titlebar { }
[07:08:39] <danzik17> gho5t: right - i think for *private* or single app use, that structure is fine, but not for public consumption
[07:08:52] <gho5t> ohh
[07:08:53] <raj> even for your private consumption, it's good not to
[07:08:56] <gho5t> this kind of is
[07:08:58] <gho5t> well is
[07:09:08] <raj> you don't wanna run into problems with your own widgets clashing
[07:09:26] <raj> and in case you use another public widget that has careless namespacing
[07:09:31] <gho5t> true
[07:09:42] <raj> word
[07:09:48] <raj> =O
[07:09:56] <raj> where the hell is bot
[07:10:01] <raj> bot-t?
[07:10:12] <raj> oh no
[07:10:13] <raj> caniuse
[07:10:16] <raj> gone
[07:13:29] <gho5t> one more best practice question. when you read an option, do you always just do this.options.myOption or do you use this.option("myOption") ? I read that for reading them it doesn't really matter
[07:16:41] <NET||abuse> hi guys, we're working on a site with some plus minus interactions on it, and a calendar, but there are complications when mobile devices view it, for now we haven't got the investment to go rebuilding for mobile, so for now i'm hoping to fix any major annoyances on mobile
[07:17:04] <NET||abuse> the main issue to day is our buttons depress when you tap them, but then don't un-depress when you untap them.
[07:18:05] <NET||abuse> this is being done by a mouseover event and the mouseout event doesn't fire
[07:18:29] <NET||abuse> clicking anywhere else on the page on android un-depresses the element, (executes the mouseout event) but ios doesn't
[07:18:42] <NET||abuse> unless you actually click something with another mouse event attached to it
[07:19:07] <NET||abuse> is there a better way to gracefully manage this interaction, without going the whole way to building a mobile version.
[07:24:43] <mattyh88> hey, i'd like to update some fields (based on the autocomplete value (id)) whenever an autocomplete field is changed. But for some reason it takes the old value from the autocomplete field instead of the new one ... is this normal?

[07:26:42] <johnkpaul> mattyh88: what event are you binding to on the autocomplete?
[07:26:59] <johnkpaul> ui.item should be the newly seelected option
[07:27:03] <johnkpaul> if you are using jquery ui's autocomplete
[07:28:26] <mattyh88> onChange
[07:29:21] <johnkpaul> onchange of the underlying text input?
[07:31:48] <mattyh88> johnkpaul: yes
[07:31:58] <johnkpaul> mattyh88: that will not work
[07:32:03] <johnkpaul> look at the jquery ui autocomplete examples

[07:40:44] <_dc> hey all...does the input event include fallbacks in jquery?
[07:40:55] <AnaRita>  i'm stuck; is jquery-localize capable of what i ask here: http://bit.ly/K9RSl6, or should I look elsewhere?
[07:40:57] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: it is an array
[07:41:00] <johnkpaul> an array is an object
[07:42:41] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: the problem: test = [1, 2, 3]; works, but the data is stored in a strin like '1, 2, 3' and i need an array containing it like [1, 2, 3]. how do i do that
[07:43:36] <johnkpaul> you already have that answer, .split(", ")
[07:45:08] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: but then it doesn't work. i tried now temp.data = eval('[' + this.data + ']'); and it works (this.data is the string like '1, 2, 3' and temp.data needs to look like [1, 2, 3]
[07:46:16] <johnkpaul> if this.data is already an array, why are you evaling it?

[07:46:51] <raj> shoky, too hefty a question?
[07:46:57] <johnkpaul> so maybe that's what you're seeing, and you think that it means that it's a string

[08:03:47] <PrgmrBill> question about creating a plugin here: http://jsfiddle.net/KCeap/
[08:04:38] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: the data that you're getting "from xml-load" is not valid json
[08:04:42] <johnkpaul> _or_ xml
[08:04:48] <johnkpaul> so that might be the start of your problems
[08:05:09] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: let me show u what firebug shows me
[08:05:43] <johnkpaul> {{"name":"something","data":"something"}} is not valid json
[08:06:56] <I3ooI3oo> Correct me if I am wrong but you can send json data to .post correct?
[08:07:01] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/Ep7bn/3/
[08:07:27] <johnkpaul> I3ooI3oo: yes, you can
[08:07:37] <johnkpaul> I believe it is converted to www/formencoded by default though
[08:08:03] <NoiseEee> Flo0815: http://jsfiddle.net/Ep7bn/4/
[08:08:08] <I3ooI3oo> So when firebug shows the json correctly in the post it should be passed to the URL in the .post?
[08:08:29] <johnkpaul> I3ooI3oo: to the URL?
[08:08:31] <johnkpaul> no
[08:08:41] <Jon30> I need a plugin that will perform a browser test to see if it's compatible with css3/html5 and then inform the user. is there such thing?
[08:09:10] <Flo0815> NoiseEee: jep, typo, but in my project i dont declare rSeries like this, it's from an XML load
[08:09:12] <johnkpaul> Jon30: there is no such thing as "compatible with css3/html5"
[08:10:29] <I3ooI3oo> johnkpaul: to the url that .post is sending to
[08:10:40] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: still on it? just for me to know if i should wait for u
[08:10:58] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: http://jsfiddle.net/Ep7bn/5/
[08:10:58] <Jon30> johnkpaul: is there a plugin to check if the browser has a css3/html5 support?
[08:11:11] <johnkpaul> Jon30: that doesn't mean anything on it's own
[08:11:17] <johnkpaul> but yes
[08:11:19] <johnkpaul> it's called modernizer
[08:11:22] <johnkpaul> I sent you a link earlier
[08:11:48] <johnkpaul> I3ooI3oo: when you use the data option in $.ajax, and pass it a javascript object, it will, by default, convert taht to www/formencoded
[08:11:52] <johnkpaul> it will not send json
[08:11:56] <johnkpaul> unless you specifically tell it to
[08:13:01] <johnkpaul> you need to set the content type somehow I3ooI3oo, I don't know how off the top of my head, but it's probably an option
[08:13:12] <I3ooI3oo> I expect form encoded but it's not passing
[08:14:06] <shoky> raj

[08:16:54] <raj> the wording is terrible, which is why I was confused and posted in the first place
[08:16:55] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: thanks but it's still not working...don't know why, i'm using the eval-shit
[08:17:15] <shoky> ahh i guess it makes sense in a twisted way
[08:17:21] <raj> exactly
[08:17:24] <johnkpaul> hm, that worked fine for me, but maybe I have different expectations
[08:17:25] <raj> twisted
[08:17:43] <raj> and there are 3 different optoins that fiddle with the same concept
[08:17:49] <Flo0815> for me it wokrs too, but not for the ongoing script
[08:17:56] <Flo0815> highchart.js
[08:18:10] <Flo0815> it's for setting the config of a chartbar
[08:18:13] <raj> anyway, none of the others seem to matter, as long as we set singleFileUploads to false
[08:18:26] <raj> however, IE doesn't respect singleFileUploads, afaiui
[08:18:52] <raj> that's why that hack is needed, with multiple input file fields
[08:19:05] <raj> but if I need to do that for IE, I might as well do it for all browsers, so my code is uniform
[08:19:35] <shoky> where i work we still got an applet for that ;P

[08:46:10] <tudda> I didn't realize this jquery command would load data from the server everytime it was clicked.  Is there a way i can use get or load and pull the content from an existing div on the SAME page (everything i see on google is talking about pulling it from a different page)
[08:47:40] <DeltaHeavy> tudda: WHy not just use something besides load from getting something from the same page?
[08:47:48] <ngharo> tudda: a webcall is not required to grab data from the current page
[08:49:35] <tudda> I'm trying to implement this "filament group navigation menu" and the syntax they provide is this :  $.get('HtmlPageThatContainsAnUnOrderedList', function (data) { $('#flyout').menu({ content: data, flyOut: true }); });
[08:50:06] <tudda> I can't have it be an html page because it's dynamic and different people get different navigation options, so i built an ashx handler to display the unordered list
[08:50:35] <tudda> but, then i realized its going to hit the server everytime they click it, i'd prefer not to do that just on principal
[08:51:07] <tudda> So i was hoping i could render the unordered list into a div, and just load the content from that div into the menu using their syntax, but #DivId doesnt seem to be working
[09:02:11] <freeed> Hey all.. does anyone know how I can prevent my page from jumping to a named anchor? I do want the location hash added to the browser bar, just want to keep the page from jumping to the anchor. Any ideas?
[09:03:27] <gho5t> e.preventDefault() ?
[09:03:46] <BinaryKitten> gho5t that would work if they didn't want to update the address bar too
[09:04:09] <BinaryKitten> freeed can you not use better hashes?
[09:04:17] <BinaryKitten> ones that are not ids of dom-elements?
[09:04:32] <freeed> gho5t, that keeps the anchor from adding the location hash to the url :(
[09:04:33] <gho5t> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[09:04:38] <gho5t> perhaps this plugin
[09:04:45] <BinaryKitten> freeed what is the # meant to represent?
[09:06:44] <freeed> BinaryKitten, I'm creating my own smooth scroll to named anchors - works fine when I used non-existant names, like #!foo. However, I'm now trying to make this still work when javascript has been disabled - so I want to use real named anchors, and simply halt the jump and use my own scroll function with jquery (hence javascript is enabled)
[09:07:13] <BinaryKitten> ah
[09:07:15] <BinaryKitten> then yes
[09:07:23] <BinaryKitten> BBQ has a hashchange hook
[09:07:34] <BinaryKitten> use that to prevent the jump and trigger the scroll
[09:07:38] <BinaryKitten> don't hook the elements
[09:08:29] <freeed> Well I'm using the jquery hashchange event, BBQ was for older browsers to mimic that behavior. But neither option lets you halt the page jump to the named anchor.
[09:08:41] <BinaryKitten> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[09:08:44] <BinaryKitten> simplest
[09:09:48] <freeed> Yea, those were used when newer browsers didn't support the event, which isn't an issue now - simply using $(window).bind('hashchange', function(e) { ..want to halt the page jump here }
[09:10:49] <freeed> Just like this question, those none of these 'awnsers' are viable.. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5720681/prevent-the-browser-to-jump-to-anchors
[09:10:56] <freeed> *though
[09:19:18] <xec_> is it possible to make .text() return newlines in place of <br>'s? (rather than stripping them out entirely)
[09:20:08] <gho5t> yeah use replace
[09:20:42] <gho5t> foo.replace("<br>", "\r\n").text()
[09:20:51] <gho5t> err
[09:20:55] <gho5t> foo.html().replace("<br>", "\r\n").text()
[09:27:32] <RA3OR> how do i change the value of a select ?
[09:28:36] <xec_> gho5t: that won't work - .html() returns text so the replace() works, but .replace() returns text and .text() is a jquery method...
[09:28:49] <Zzaichik> $('#element').val('new value');
[09:29:27] <gho5t> simple fix
[09:29:54] <sayd> RA3OR: .val doesnt work?

[09:38:39] <sayd> the option with the value you are setting woud need to be there already

[09:48:54] <Ddjay> yeah
[09:48:56] <Ddjay> ^^
[09:48:57] <Ddjay> thx

[09:49:07] <RA3OR> sayd: =/ you serious man?
[09:49:16] <RA3OR> thirdender: no, im not
[09:49:35] <sayd> it selected the val
[09:49:39] <RA3OR> i want UNIQUE id's in selects or a simple - if a duplicate is selectED
[09:49:51] <RA3OR> this is before i submit/do the actual query
[09:50:13] <gho5t> sounds dumb
[09:50:20] <RA3OR> gho5t: ?
[09:50:55] <nFFF> RA3OR if a duplicate selected? dont have duplicates on your page? :Z
[09:51:10] <thirdender> RA3OR: you're looking at two degrees of separation from the database to your Javascript... the Javascript doesn't know what's in your database, and it can't look there. Make sure whatever PHP or Java or whatever server side code is generating your SELECT in the first place doesn't put the duplicates there
[09:51:12] <RA3OR> if i select 2 in the first SELECT
[09:51:22] <RA3OR> the 2 on secont select NEEDS TO CHANGE
[09:51:28] <RA3OR> either to a '-'
[09:51:31] <amberfly> RA3OR: Even if you check duplicates with js, it won't make much of a difference in terms of input validation
[09:51:32] <RA3OR> or a 2+1
[09:51:43] <RA3OR> and should cascade to other select options
[09:51:56] <RA3OR> amberfly: not issue here
[09:52:09] <thirdender> oh, okay, that's a different problem then...
[09:52:30] <RA3OR> thirdender: the js can look at html
[09:52:45] <Aaronds> Hi, if I'm using $('div.row').mouseup(), how can I get the ID of the attribute in question?
[09:53:07] <RA3OR> the Logic is: if a number is selected, lets say 2, in column 1, first select
[09:53:07] <Ddjay> onemore question, the last one ! :) how to unset a cookie using jquery set by PHP (don't know if usefull to say how it has been set)
[09:53:17] <xec_> Aaronds: you mean element, not attribute, i'm guessing. tried this.id ?
[09:53:17] <thirdender> Aaronds: you mean the ID of the element receiving the mouseup event?
[09:53:22] <amberfly> RA3OR: But if you really want to, bind a function to the $("select").change() event and handle the modification of the values of the other selects from there
[09:53:30] <RA3OR> then i want jquery to look at #select-2 and change that value
[09:53:33] <RA3OR> to -
[09:53:40] <Aaronds> yes sorry xec_, thirdender. xec_, I did try ($this).id
[09:53:45] <Aaronds> $(this).id*
[09:53:47] <NoiseEee> RA3OR: http://jsfiddle.net/rpm5M/19/
[09:53:52] <xec_> Aaronds: well, try this.id instead
[09:53:53] <gho5t> $(this).attr("id")
[09:54:40] <RA3OR> NoiseEee: not working?
[09:55:04] <Aaronds> works a charm, thanks gho5t
[09:55:09] <xec_> sigh
[09:55:17] <Aaronds> sorry xec_ >_>
[09:55:19] <gho5t> you should actually do this.id though
[09:55:22] <Aaronds> oh
[09:55:23] <Aaronds> ok
[09:55:26] <gho5t> no need to wrap it in jquery for that
[09:55:43] <Aaronds> ah yes I'll use htat
[09:55:44] <Aaronds> thanks guys
[09:55:51] <NoiseEee> RA3OR: sure it is. it's adding an <option val='-'>-</option> to #select-3 every time shown/hide changes

[09:56:28] <Ddjay> :D
[09:58:10] <RA3OR> NoiseEee: to me its not, and show/hide select is in 3rd column
[09:58:48] <RA3OR> simpler: http://jsfiddle.net/rpm5M/23/
[09:58:56] <sovok> Ddjay: Hm. You can set/unset cookies with http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie but no idea if you can unset existing cookies with that. Try it
[09:59:06] <RA3OR> so, if I change the value on either of the selects
[09:59:08] <NoiseEee> RA3OR: well thats working too.
[09:59:33] <sovok> Ddjay: http://serversideguy.com/2010/07/06/cookies-with-jquery/
[09:59:37] <RA3OR> i want the value of #select-<selected_ID> to change to "-"
[09:59:45] <Ddjay> sovok there's no 'native' solution with jQuery ?
[09:59:48] <NoiseEee> RA3OR: then make the option selected
[10:00:16] <Ddjay> $.cookie("cookie_name", null); <------ thats what i did, but it seems not working ....
[10:00:25] <Ddjay> or i did something wrong
[10:00:28] <RA3OR> NoiseEee: pm plm
[10:00:40] <RA3OR> pls*
[10:00:58] <NoiseEee> RA3OR: no.  http://jsfiddle.net/rpm5M/24/
[10:01:20] <RA3OR> yeah, that works
[10:01:24] <NoiseEee> yeah thanks
[10:01:42] <sovok> Ddjay: no cookie stuff built in, thus the library. $.cookie("cookie_name", null); seems right (if "cookie_name" is changed to the right name :>)
[10:01:43] <NoiseEee> you know, nothing automatically happens unless you specify it to happen
[10:01:45] <RA3OR> thanks, but its half done :D
[10:01:54] <RA3OR> how can I make it dynamic
[10:02:01] <RA3OR> if i select 3 anywhere?
[10:02:05] <NoiseEee> RA3OR: well surely you have enough of a base to complete the 2nd half.
[10:02:08] <RA3OR> to change value of #select-4
[10:02:28] <RA3OR> concatenates like js ?
[10:02:29] <NoiseEee> RA3OR: take the time to learn some js/jquery basics and you will know what to do

[10:06:06] <gnarf> ?jsisjs @RA3OR
[10:06:06] <bot-t> RA3OR, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[10:06:10] <RA3OR> NoiseEee: like mysql is sql

[10:06:59] <gnarf> NoiseEee: bad comparison. mysql is one flavor of sql - jQuery is a JavaScript library - meaning you are still writing JavaScript - just using jQuery

[10:23:53] <sovok> vadi: than use 'https' in the url, like thirdender suggested
[10:24:02] <mbtez> the main problem is that
[10:24:08] <mbtez> it has to be able to have just one page viewable at the beginning

[10:24:21] <mbtez> on any other page...
[10:24:49] <vadi> sovok, Thanks sovok. I will do it so.
[10:24:59] <sovok> Ddjay: try setting the cookies expire date negative: $.cookie("name", "", { path: '/', expires: -1 });
[10:24:59] <vadi> I understand that if nothing is set, the ajax
[10:25:19] <vadi> use https or http acording to the current one used in the page being rendered, sovok ?
[10:25:26] <Ddjay> ok sovok

[10:38:57] <shoky> diegoviola have you seen $.ajax()
[10:39:00] <johnkpaul> diegoviola: in that gist, I don't see what you're trying to do, there's no logic about the success of the ajax code

[10:40:03] <johnkpaul> ah ok, great, it's no problem
[10:40:12] <johnkpaul> @I3ooI3oo
[10:40:25] <johnkpaul> diegoviola: I don't think I suggested that, thanks belong to shoky :)
[10:40:41] <diegoviola> johnkpaul: oh ok, thanks anyway
[10:40:44] <diegoviola> shoky: thanks a bunch
[10:40:57] <shoky> no no back to jkp
[10:41:04] <shoky> and then ill take it for a bit
[10:41:07] <shoky> and then you give it back to him
[10:41:08] <shoky> k??
[10:41:24] <johnkpaul> haha
[10:41:31] <diegoviola> heh
[10:41:41] <I3ooI3oo> The only think that bothers me is that it worked using json while it was hardcoded in the function but when I passed it a var it stopped working.
[10:42:14] <johnkpaul> I3ooI3oo: I dont' remember your code at the moment, but the reason for that is probably because jquery makes some inferences in one case but not the other
[10:42:20] <shoky> mbtez: what animate function
[10:42:32] <gho5t> jquery ui tabs .add method only accepts a url? there is no way to pass in the html you want to be shown in the tab?
[10:43:15] <shoky> you can change it with .html()
[10:43:24] <shoky> with the right selector
[10:43:31] <tesmar> hi all, how can I get .on to operate just like .live() ?
[10:43:42] <tesmar> If I use .live() my call worksd, but now with .on()

[10:47:18] <bung> if anyone knows much about inner workigns of jquery-ajax type stuff :)
[10:48:27] <I3ooI3oo> Get allows you to pass vars to the page i don't think load () does.
[10:48:52] <neybar> I have a dumb form question.  In "vanilla" js I can do document.form_name.field_name.value.  In jquery I can't do $('#form').field_name.val()  What is the jquery way to do that?  $('#form).find('input[name=foo]') seems a little clunky.
[10:49:00] <shoky> bung: if you assume that the two methods are doing the same thing, then why should that mean that one is faster than the other
[10:49:04] <bung> fair enough, and do you think any performance difference is negligible
[10:49:19] <bung> i dunno, does wrapping stuff mean more is happening
[10:49:27] <shoky> hardly
[10:49:37] <bung> thats what i dont know :)
[10:49:51] <shoky> well i'll just order my pizza and have a look at the sources
[10:50:00] <shoky> if thats OK
[10:50:54] <dabear> bung: yes, it does actually do a $("<div>").append("page source").find("selector") behind the scenes
[10:50:58] <gho5t> jquery ui tabs .add method only accepts a url? there is no way to pass in the html you want to be shown in the tab?
[10:51:00] <EchoBravo> ney: $('#field').val() should work fine..
[10:51:04] <I3ooI3oo> With load you can load just  fragment which means it shoul dbe faster if you write your code correctly
[10:51:05] <dabear> bung: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.load shows how it does it
[10:51:09] <johnkpaul> gho5t: shoky answered you earlier
[10:51:16] <gho5t> wasn't sure that was for me
[10:51:31] <gho5t> shoky: can you elaborate on that
[10:51:52] <neybar> EchoBravo: only if I put id's on every element (which seems excessive to me)
[10:52:23] <gho5t> l3ool3oo: me?
[10:52:31] <I3ooI3oo> no
[10:53:01] <bung> dabear: interesting, thank you
[10:53:12] <mbtez> how do i open an id like "#2" with jquery
[10:53:31] <dabear> mbtez: "open" ?
[10:53:33] <mbtez> like
[10:53:36] <mbtez> it would normally snap down to it
[10:53:39] <mbtez> if you clicked a link to "#2"
[10:53:41] <I3ooI3oo> The ID actually has the # in it?
[10:53:45] <mbtez> no
[10:53:48] <mbtez> id 2
[10:54:12] <dabear> document.location = "#id2"
[10:54:27] <xec_> ?scrollto @ mbtez
[10:54:28] <bot-t> mbtez, ScrollTo - Plugins - jQuery - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[10:54:30] <johnkpaul> gho5t: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ajax.html
[10:54:37] <johnkpaul> you can just update the element that the tab is tied to directly
[10:54:38] <mbtez> it doesn't even scroll though
[10:54:40] <shoky> ok PIzza_Being_Baked $_$
[10:54:42] <mbtez> because this is slidejs
[10:54:49] <mbtez> it uses that as a reference to open a page
[10:54:50] <silverwind> mbtez, ids must start with a letter and contains no spaces.
[10:54:55] <mbtez> oh, yeah
[10:54:57] <mbtez> but you get the idea
[10:55:43] <xec_> silverwind: i used to think that too, but they actually don't need to
[10:56:37] <gho5t> johnkpaul: I don't think this is what I need. I want to be able to do this: $('#tabs1').tabs('add', '<H1>HIIII</H1>', 'Tab ' + tab_counter);
[10:56:50] <gho5t> on an "add tab" button
[10:57:18] <johnkpaul> that's not possible ootb, gho5t, I am giving you an alternative
[10:57:28] <dezzz> Hi
[10:57:36] <dezzz> is there some jquery way of doing this:
[10:57:38] <dezzz> $('button').button({icons: { primary: this.text()}});
[10:57:39] <gho5t> ok. yeah I can't preload the content.
[10:57:48] <chris_mh> // Microsoft forgot to hump their vendor prefix (#9572)
[10:58:04] <gho5t> it's actually making a service call and i want to format the returned json using a template
[10:58:08] <dezzz> as in process all the buttons, and get the text from each button with this being the current button being processed
[10:58:09] <chris_mh> ahh hahaha jquery has "hump" in the source
[10:58:18] <gho5t> i suppose i can just return the html from the service
[10:58:36] <chris_mh> k, jquery is awesome. back to work.
[10:59:46] <xec_> silverwind: in html5 a valid id is basically "a unique identifier, at least one character and no spaces"  http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#the-id-attribute
[11:03:29] <johnkpaul> http://mothereff.in/unquoted-attributes
[11:03:41] <johnkpaul> wait, that's not it
[11:03:51] <johnkpaul> there's some tool that tells you if something is a valid id
[11:06:44] <vIkSiT> hello all
[11:07:04] <vIkSiT> is there a way to use jquery.get(url) to also execute all the script tags in the newly loaded page?
[11:07:33] <vIkSiT> I do something like : $.get(url, function(d) { document.body.append(d);}) hoping that script tags in the url get executed
[11:07:37] <vIkSiT> but that doesn't seem to work as expected.
[11:08:05] <Snerf> Is there a way with .resizable to have handles around an element, like dots in each corner, etc, such like how a photoshop type program does it?
[11:08:26] <Snerf> dont know what the right term for it is
[11:09:21] <xec_> Snerf: i call them "stretchythingys", but this is a technical term
[11:10:17] <Snerf> hehe, well, w/e they are called, is there an option to add them to a .resizable object?
[11:20:42] <vadi> If I send a ajax request with an httpS://  url,  from a http:// web page, I note jquery rewrite the httpS url and send it over http:// transport, isn't it?
[11:28:46] <shoky> noted
[11:29:02] <FernandoBasso> The if else block is not working: https://gist.github.com/2491955
[11:29:20] <FernandoBasso> http://gotek.no-ip.org:8080/BadSites/intro.html
[11:29:46] <shoky> try: if ($('.irr:visible').length) {
[11:29:58] <shoky> and just else {
[11:30:17] <shoky> or.
[11:32:12] <shoky> FernandoBasso: https://gist.github.com/2491971
[11:32:48] <smykes> can you use .find in a true statement?
[11:34:37] <xec_> smykes: sounds very existential! what does it mean?
[11:34:55] <silverwind> What is a true statement?
[11:35:01] <smykes> does find return a boolean?
[11:35:19] <silverwind> It returns an array-like jquery object?
[11:35:59] <smykes> so $("#foo").find("bar");
[11:36:04] <smykes> wouldnt return true or false?
[11:36:18] <shoky> This is a false statement.    <--- true or false??????????????!?!
[11:36:20] <FernandoBasso> shoky: It works! And the solutions is less expensive and more elegant. Thanks.
[11:36:26] <shoky> np
[11:36:51] <smykes> so if ($("#foo").find("bar") {
[11:37:06] <silverwind> Or you can be explicit...
[11:37:14] <xec_> smykes: no it returns a collection
[11:37:20] <silverwind> if ($("#foo").find("bar") .length > 0) {
[11:37:24] <xec_> smykes: you can do .length to see if it found anything
[11:37:29] <smykes> oh nice
[11:37:31] <smykes> that would work
[11:40:44] <chopkorn>   $('#project').('#show img').hide(); - trying to hide all img in span id #show under <tr> id #project - should work, no?
[11:41:55] <smykes> that worked thanks silverwind and xec_ sorry for my confusing question
[11:42:36] <nFFF> chopkorn, no
[11:43:05] <nFFF> check your console
[11:43:07] <chopkorn> i figured :(
[11:43:10] <batdorf> Anyone familiar with handlebars?
[11:44:08] <batdorf> or templating
[11:44:36] <xec_> is it anything like planking?
[11:44:36] <hbastidas> $(document).ready(function(){ alert("hello") })
[11:44:43] <chopkorn> maybe i should actually read jquery in action instead of doing stupid shit like this.
[11:45:02] <batdorf> planking is so 2000-late
[11:45:05] <silverwind> I would avoid any book on jquery.
[11:45:15] <silverwind> They're probably all outdated anyway.
[11:46:09] <chopkorn> probably gets the message across.
[11:46:46] <nFFF> use the jquery site
[11:46:56] <nFFF> the librarys pretty self explanatory
[11:47:06] <nFFF> just think of adjective that describes what you want to do
[11:47:14] <nFFF> and the method probably exists :D
[11:47:20] <tudda> I am looking for a navigation menu plugin that supports jquery themes, butit seems like the only good one is the filament one and it requires the content to be in an external file
[11:48:53] <batdorf> tuts has an excellent jquery 30-day course
[11:49:06] <batdorf> its free right now for some reason (by mistake maybe?): http://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/
[11:51:32] <xec_> chopkorn: we all did stupid shit when starting out, it's the best way to learn imo. the worse you fuck up the better you remember ;)
[11:52:23] <smykes> I spent 12 hours debugging a mistake that was cause becdause I used an || instead of an &&
[11:52:29] <chopkorn> :(
[11:53:11] <smykes> if you don't make stupid mistakes I don;t think you are learning
[11:53:21] <MichaelBehan> -stupid
[11:54:01] <xec_> MichaelBehan: as opposed to clever mistakes? :)
[11:54:12] <MichaelBehan> Correct.
[11:54:26] <MichaelBehan> Mistake == Learn == Clever
[11:54:53] <smykes> Mistake == Learn + Mistake == Kind of Clever
[11:55:07] <MichaelBehan> Notice I didn't use type comparison
[11:55:09] <MichaelBehan> :P
[11:55:13] <xec_> hehe
[11:55:21] <silverwind> My point is that jQuery "evolves" too rapidly so you cannot get a decent book on it.
[11:55:26] <xec_> plus "Mistake" is not defined
[11:55:36] <silverwind> Read the online documentation... write code and learn.
[11:55:40] <smykes> get a decent javascript pocket guide
[11:56:13] <smykes> oh and chopkorn read this like 25 times http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:56:17] <smykes> it is by ajpiano
[11:57:17] <smykes> SERIOUSLY 25 TIMES
[11:58:01] <ajpiano> smykes: it's like training for a disaster situation.... seems superfluous until you run into the actual situation and then you can deal with it quickly and calmly :)
[11:58:59] <xec_> slide 1 isn't too bad though
[11:59:37] <Aquaguy> Hey there!
[11:59:44] <smykes> ajpiano I've read it quite a few times, it is a work of art
[11:59:45] <Aquaguy> Anyone here has used strophejs?
[11:59:53] <ajpiano> i gotta get that sucker up to date
[11:59:55] <ajpiano> :p
[12:00:03] <smykes> yeah i was just going to say that
[12:00:07] <smykes> some of the links are dead
[12:00:13] <smykes> and live is no longer kosher
[12:01:07] <smykes> like the one to jquery lint
[12:02:51] <smykes> ajpiano you're a ginger!
[12:02:57] <ajpiano> forreal
[12:03:16] <smykes> i imagined you much more obese
[12:03:20] <smykes> and with much more hair
[12:03:22] <gho5t> what is a fragment-identifier
[12:03:23] <smykes> err less
[12:03:25] <ajpiano> LOL
[12:03:27] <gho5t> in terms of jquery ui tabs
[12:03:50] <ajpiano> gho5t: the id of the element that has the tab's content, and the href of the tab that links to it
[12:04:06] <smykes> I just followed you on twitter im not stalking you ajpiano i was trying to figure out hwat you were doing in your picture
[12:04:41] <ajpiano> haha don't worry i'll know when you're stalking me :x
[12:04:44] <gho5t> ajpiano: is it possible to just have a fragment identifier so the content can be pulled in from a div on the page instead of using ajax?
[12:05:09] <ajpiano> what do you mean "pulled in from a div on the page"
[12:05:09] <gho5t> i want to open a new tab but I don't want to make the separate ajax request cause it's not needed
[12:05:21] <ajpiano> oh
[12:05:29] <ajpiano> yes i believe that is possible
[12:06:00] <ajpiano> yeah you can pass in the ID of a new element on the page
[12:06:05] <ajpiano> to be made into a tab
[12:06:08] <ajpiano> with the tabs.add method
[12:06:33] <gho5t> hmm
[12:06:35] <gho5t> $('#tabs1').tabs('add', '#test', $this.text());
[12:06:37] <smykes> ajpiano aren't you in florida?  How does a ginger survive in florida?  do you own stock in sunscreen?
[12:06:44] <gho5t> i have <div id="test">foo</div>
[12:06:45] <gho5t> no luck
[12:06:50] <ajpiano> FLORIDA no sheesh... NYC
[12:06:56] <coachz> Can anyone recommend a simple loader that will let me conditionally load css and js files on certain pages ?
[12:07:03] <ajpiano> gho5t: can you make a quick fiddle ?
[12:07:07] <gho5t> yeah
[12:07:21] <dvg> ahoy ahoy
[12:07:39] <coachz>  so if i specify colorbox, i  want to load the css for it in head and the js for it
[12:07:40] <batdorf> hey im from florida! :P
[12:07:50] <xec_> smykes: maybe you're stalking the wrong ginger?!
[12:07:59] <xec_> all this time
[12:08:02] <smykes> maybe but it is a big penis shaped state
[12:08:03] <ajpiano> smykes: ohhh didn't realise it was you, that you had changed nicks
[12:08:12] <dvg> I'm having this exact same problem: http://eric.polerecky.com/jquery-ajax-prepend-and-events-onclick/
[12:08:18] <smykes> oh sorry, this is my usual handle
[12:09:07] <dvg> Is the solution to use .on() for everything?  I'm confused.
[12:09:34] <smykes> i think i just made a big mistake and installed jquery.lint on my current project
[12:09:46] <ajpiano> haha yea jq lint is a bit dubious i suppose
[12:09:48] <ajpiano> esp at this point
[12:10:13] <smykes> so many errors
[12:10:14] <coachz> so what's the best javascript loader ?
[12:10:19] <smykes> lets just pretned this never happend
[12:10:35] <dvg> Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?
[12:11:32] <mbtez> can i just open the link "#6" without scrollTo?
[12:11:56] <rroelofs> dvg: Yes, .on replaces .bind, .live and .delegate
[12:12:03] <mbtez> with jquery/js?
[12:12:42] <batdorf> dvg, can you paste your code (via pastebin)
[12:12:44] <xec_> mbtez: that doesn't look like a link to me
[12:13:32] <mbtez> a href="#6"
[12:13:34] <gho5t> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/KkhMc/
[12:13:38] <mbtez> scrolls to id 6
[12:13:41] <mbtez> or you know
[12:13:42] <xec_> right
[12:13:42] <mbtez> "#id"
[12:13:59] <smykes> lol there is a podcast named yayquery
[12:14:04] <dvg> batdorf: would love to. What's pastebin?
[12:14:54] <NoiseEee> dvg: <div id='commonParent'><a href='#'>click me</a></div>.    assuming you are dynamically adding <a>'s to #commonParent, you use:  $('#commonParent').on('click','a',function(ev) { alert('yoink!'); });
[12:14:56] <xec_> smykes: for real! you've been missing out! although it's slightly dead nowadays i believe
[12:15:27] <smykes> xec_ I can still listen to the old ones
[12:16:45] <dvg> http://pastebin.com/jSxESvFp
[12:17:31] <dvg> a collection of checkboxes; adding one via ajax works, but then newly-added one doesn't respond to clicks
[12:18:33] <smykes> ajpiano less or sass
[12:18:56] <ajpiano> i don't have strongly held opinions about css preprocessors really yet
[12:19:17] <knapper_tech> How can jQuery On be set up to work for detecting dom insertion?
[12:19:33] <ajpiano> i've used sass/compass and stylus in projects but not really had to author any of them
[12:20:06] <smykes> ive been using less but i haven't tried sass
[12:20:12] <smykes> less seemed easier to jump into
[12:20:32] <rroelofs> dvg: you need the "delegate" form of .on   ie $(parent).on("click", "input[type=checkbox], function() ...)
[12:20:36] <dvg> knapper_tech: very similar to my current question, referenced at http://eric.polerecky.com/jquery-ajax-prepend-and-events-onclick/
[12:21:00] <dvg> rroelofs:  ahhh ... will try that
[12:22:07] <gho5t> ajpiano: did you see my link?
[12:22:18] <ajpiano> gho5t: it actually *creates* a new tab at the time, with that *as* the identifier
[12:22:34] <ajpiano> still trying to figure out how to make it do what you want
[12:22:52] <dvg> rroelofs:  BITCHIN'
[12:22:53] <gho5t> yeah i see it creating the tab just not the content
[12:23:47] <rroelofs> dvg: glad it worked for you.
[12:24:44] <freeed> Hey all… does anyone know why a fixed position element (sidebar) would give drastically incorrect values with ele.offset().top? If I change the element to relative or absolute positioning the offet values are correct :\ Any ideas?
[12:31:38] <dorgan> ok so i am using $.post(....)  the post is being executed but the callback function is never being executed, status code 200 is coming back so now I am lost
[12:31:38] <gho5t> ajpiano: looks like the div needs to be a part of the parent .tabs div
[12:31:55] <dorgan> i have 'json' after the callback function and i am returning json
[12:31:57] <NoiseEee> dorgan: crystal... ball... fuzzy
[12:32:01] <dorgan> so i am not quite sure what is going on
[12:32:11] <NoiseEee> ?demo @ dorgan
[12:32:11] <bot-t> dorgan, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:32:17] <gho5t> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/KkhMc/3/
[12:35:37] <dorgan> OK i cant post working copy as its ajax and the server is private but here is the code and the response:  http://pastebin.com/tjKiP5EF
[12:35:53] <dorgan> the callback function never gets called
[12:37:35] <rroelofs> dorgan: have you verified that the server is sending what you expect?
[12:38:10] <dorgan> yes
[12:38:13] <gho5t> and that it's hitting the service
[12:38:32] <dorgan> the only thing i am checking for is data.success to be = "true" and it is
[12:38:54] <dorgan> like i said the response code 200 comes back so its not having an issue with the request and the expected json is coming back
[12:39:06] <dorgan> the callback function is never called though
[12:39:24] <gho5t> aren't you checking if data.success === true within the callback?
[12:39:55] <zeta-> I'm trying to do browser selection in jq :  FF quietly ignores it, as it should -- but IE8 says $.browser is null or not an object :-s
[12:39:56] <rroelofs> dorgan: have you validated the json?  and checked your brower's error console?
[12:39:56] <zeta-> if ($.browser.msie && (parseInt($.browser.version, 10) <= 8) ) { ... }
[12:40:40] <dorgan> ahh i think i solved it
[12:40:41] <zeta-> 8) should be 8 )
[12:40:41] <dorgan> :)
[12:40:42] <rroelofs> dorgan: the json is parsed before the callback is called so invalid json can cause what you are seing
[12:40:59] <dorgan> theres a quote in there thats not encoded
[12:41:56] <rroelofs> dorgan:  http://jsonlint.com/ is your friend
[12:48:15] <streblo> i'm using two separate libraries that are both binding a function name ('datepicker') to the $ object
[12:48:26] <streblo> any easy way to alias one to something else?
[12:49:00] <streblo> will $.old_datepicker = $.datepicker have unintended side effects?
[12:49:17] <rhino_> in jquery, how do you get the text of a div?
[12:49:45] <streblo> rhino_: $(element).html('');
[12:50:03] <streblo> will clear all of the html
[12:50:15] <streblo> $(element).text(''); will clear the text
[12:50:32] <gho5t> don't pass anything to text
[12:50:35] <gho5t> read the docs
[12:51:48] <knapper_tech> does jQuery html() generate an event or use some DOM wrappable function that I can use to detect when an element is changed via .html()?
[12:52:08] <streblo> gho5t: if you dont pass anything to .text() itll just give you the text of the elemnt(s)
[12:52:17] <streblo> s/elemnts/elements
[12:52:55] <rhino_> streblo:  I have this in a click event:  alert ($('#medstaticname '+ this.id).html());  with the following div:  <div id="medstaticname236" style="width:250px;height:20px;float:left;">15</div>  how can I alert the text of that div?
[12:53:04] <streblo> knapper_tech: http://api.jquery.com/change/
[12:53:24] <rhino_> streblo, it just alerts null
[12:53:49] <NoiseEee> rhino_: well then you should see what 'this.id' is and see what your actual selector is
[12:54:16] <NoiseEee> streblo: change does not work on non-form elements
[12:54:26] <streblo> rhino_: looks like you've got a space in the selector, but not in your html
[12:54:35] <snow0x2d0> also you have a trailing space after medstaticname but your id is medstaticname[number]
[12:54:47] <rhino_> streblo:  ah, tnx
[12:54:48] <snow0x2d0> right, what he said
[12:55:14] <streblo> knapper_tech: you could trigger the change manually
[12:57:41] <johnkpaul> knapper_tech: in all browsers, no
[12:57:46] <johnkpaul> there is  DOMMutationEvent that you can google for
[12:57:57] <johnkpaul> but I'd rethink what you were doing, tbh
[12:58:01] <johnkpaul> why do you need to know when .html() is called?
[12:58:15] <johnkpaul> worst worst case, you could overwrrite the definition of .html
[12:58:28] <johnkpaul> but don't do that
[12:59:18] <streblo> you could always write a simple plugin
[12:59:30] <streblo> that does what johnkpaul is saying
[13:00:16] <ManxPower> is the easiest way to get around same-origin requirements to use a proxy script on the server to access the prohibited locaion?
[13:00:31] <ManxPower> (i.e. my page loads from port 80, I have to access data on port 8000.
[13:00:52] <knapper_tech> does .html() rely on any dom function in particular?
[13:01:03] <streblo> ManxPower: you could also use jsonp
[13:01:07] <shoky> knapper_tech it relies on .innerHtml i believe
[13:01:15] <shoky> maybe has a fallback or smth
[13:01:19] <knapper_tech> and that's just a property?
[13:01:27] <johnkpaul> knapper_tech: yes, it just uses .html http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.fn.html
[13:01:32] <knapper_tech> wonder if i can detect that ..
[13:01:32] <johnkpaul> and it is a property
[13:01:35] <shoky> yes, you can thank microsoft for that
[13:01:36] <ManxPower> streblo: from what little I read about jsonp it still requires a "proxy"?
[13:01:42] <johnkpaul> knapper_tech: can you explain what you're trying to do?
[13:01:52] <johnkpaul> ManxPower: yes, that is the easiest way
[13:01:59] <johnkpaul> CORS is the other way
[13:02:11] <johnkpaul> jsonp could be used as the implementation of how the data comes from your proxy script
[13:02:12] <johnkpaul> or not
[13:02:16] <johnkpaul> ?g CORS @ ManxPower
[13:02:17] <bot-t> ManxPower, Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) - National ... - http://geodesy.noaa.gov/CORS/
[13:02:20] <johnkpaul> ha
[13:02:25] <johnkpaul> ?g cross origin resource sharing @ ManxPower
[13:02:26] <bot-t> ManxPower, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
[13:02:29] <ManxPower> johnkpaul: I'd use plain old json for that.
[13:02:40] <streblo> ManxPower: i'm not sure what you mean by it needs a proxy
[13:02:47] <johnkpaul> yes, if you had a proxy on the same domain, you could use json and regular ajax
[13:03:11] <ManxPower> johnkpaul: The data is on the same domain, it is not on the same port.
[13:03:11] <streblo> right, and if you had to get it off another domain, you could use jsonp in nearly the same way
[13:03:36] <ManxPower> It took me a while to realize that "domain" doesn't mean "dns domain"
[13:03:38] <johnkpaul> ?sop @ ManxPower
[13:03:39] <bot-t> ManxPower, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[13:03:39] <knapper_tech> johnkpaul:   a 3rd part script uses .html() to update the contents of a dom element following an asynch ajax call
[13:03:54] <johnkpaul> yeah, ManxPower, it's actually described as "origin" not domain
[13:03:59] <johnkpaul> it's not just the domain name
[13:04:00] <streblo> ManxPower: a different port is considered a different origin
[13:04:17] <johnkpaul> knapper_tech: ok, and you can't modify that third party script?
[13:04:21] <knapper_tech> because the call is asych, I can't just call the method and write code after it.  because the .html() doesn't use .appendChild() etc, i can't overload it
[13:04:23] <knapper_tech> cannot
[13:04:55] <ManxPower> streblo: What I mean is run a script (same domain) to connect to the real port, make the request, encode it as json and send it back to the requesting ajax call.  "proxy" the data.
[13:04:56] <knapper_tech> so it's being really difficult an i'm considering just checking the dom element every 100ms or so
[13:05:13] <ManxPower> where "script" in my case is a php script
[13:05:18] <streblo> ManxPower: thats a totally acceptable solution
[13:05:51] <ManxPower> streblo: I come up with a lot of dumb ideas -- just wanted a reality check.  thanks!
[13:05:59] <johnkpaul> knapper_tech: is this third party some entitty that you could just ask to add a jquery trigger something
[13:06:46] <rroelofs> knapper_tech: or can you pass in a completion routine to the other lib?
[13:07:14] <shoky> hah
[13:07:33] <shoky> from $.fn.html() source:
[13:07:34] <shoky> 				} catch(e) {}
[13:07:41] <shoky> // If using innerHTML throws an exception, use the fallback method
[13:07:55] <shoky> empty catch
[13:08:11] <rroelofs> yeah, the comment suggests there is a fallback for innerHTML but there isn't
[13:08:14] <shoky> ah ok not relly
[13:08:20] <shoky> there is
[13:08:33] <shoky> this.empty().append( value );
[13:08:37] <shoky> i guess
[13:08:45] <shoky> yeah
[13:08:46] <knapper_tech> johnkpaul:   this would assume that the 3rd party application providers are humans etc.    it's a shopify application providing some data.  i'm basically monitoring other javascript applications and running hidden pieces of the page via remote control.
[13:08:50] <shoky> which uses .appendChild
[13:09:03] <knapper_tech> johnkpaul:  i wish the world just made sense
[13:09:21] <johnkpaul> knapper_tech: if this is your world, go take a walk outside and come back to it in 20 minutes ;)
[13:09:32] <johnkpaul> and, you could reach out to shopify developer advocates
[13:09:52] <johnkpaul> they'll probably get back to you about this really quickly
[13:10:09] <rroelofs> shoky:  aah.  I see.
[13:10:51] * shoky explores jQuery.access()
[13:11:09] <shoky> ?access
[13:11:10] <bot-t> shoky, Access Key Highlighter - Plugins - jQuery - The Access Key Highlighter plugin provides various options for highlighting access keys on web forms when the user presses their browser's access key shortcut key, e.g. Alt in Internet Explorer and... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/AccessKeyHighlighter
[13:11:15] <shoky> fuck you
[13:11:35] <shoky> hi
[13:14:26] <johnkpaul> shoky: what is jquery.access?
[13:14:53] <gho5t> I am using jquery ui tabs. I have a list of items on my page and when I click on one I want to show a new tab with that object's details in it. I am setting the tab's url to the http service that returns json. I want to take this json and then apply a js template to it. Does it sound like the right way to do this is to hook into the load event?
[13:15:05] <shoky> .html() wraps its whole body in a call to jQuery.access
[13:15:21] <shoky> and .access starts off:
[13:15:21] <shoky> 	// Mutifunctional method to get and set values to a collection
[13:15:21] <shoky> 	// The value/s can optionally be executed if it's a function
[13:15:22] <shoky> 	access: function( elems, fn, key, value, chainable, emptyGet, pass ) {
[13:15:34] <johnkpaul> oh, that's in 1.7
[13:15:35] <shoky> so jonhkpaul: no frikkin idea
[13:15:40] <johnkpaul> not in 1.6
[13:15:44] <johnkpaul> I don't know either, never encountered it
[13:16:10] <gho5t> if that is the case then my question is how to get the actual response
[13:16:13] <gho5t> in the load event
[13:16:22] <johnkpaul> hm, I think it makes things chainable shoky
[13:16:41] <shoky> Hm
[13:17:59] <streblo> i'm trying to alias the $.fn.datepicker function to something else, because both bootstrap and jqueryui use it. before the bootstrap datepicker is defined, i'm calling jQuery.fn.xdatepicker = jQuery.fn.datepicker. but when i load my page, the $.xdatepicker is undefined. what gives?
[13:18:43] <shoky> $.xdatepicker or $(...).xdatepicker ?
[13:19:02] <streblo> shoky: the latter
[13:19:02] <shoky> $.fn.xdatepicker  makes it availible on jquery objects
[13:19:07] <shoky> ok
[13:19:58] <streblo> shoky: nevermind, i was doing something dumb
[13:20:46] <gho5t> I am using jquery ui tabs. I have a list of items on my page and when I click on one I want to show a new tab with that object's details in it. I am setting the tab's url to the http service that returns json. I want to take this json and then apply a js template to it. Does it sound like the right way to do this is to hook into the load event?
[13:21:06] <NoiseEee> gho5t: please don't repeat
[13:21:36] <gho5t> sorry. been stuck on this for a while
[13:27:21] <Noah_AT> can anyone here offer some assistance with pattern matching?
[13:28:18] <destinydriven> Noah_AT, no
[13:30:20] <Snerf> Is there a way with .resizable to have handles around an element, like dots in each corner, etc, such like how a photoshop type program does it?
[13:30:37] <destinydriven> Noah_AT, don't ask to ask. State your problem  . . . show what you've tried and perhaps if someone can help, they will
[13:31:17] <Aquaguy> anyone here as ever used strophejs library?

[13:41:17] <BaruchHashem> i want to have addClass( and then this css class in there .services-sidebar ul li a.active   what is the syntax for that?
[13:43:12] <johnkpaul> BaruchHashem: .addClass takes a single sting that is the class that you want to add to the element
[13:43:19] <johnkpaul> can you explain what you're tryig to do
[13:43:50] <batdorf> $(".services-sidebar ul li a:active").addClass  <--- that?
[13:44:01] <johnkpaul> what is the class that you want to add?
[13:44:09] <johnkpaul> oh, wait, you're not BaruchHashem :)
[13:44:14] <BaruchHashem> johnkpaul: the class is active
[13:44:22] <BaruchHashem> johnkpaul i kinda figured it out, thanks
[13:44:31] <johnkpaul> ha ok
[13:44:33] <wathek> Hi everybody
[13:44:53] <batdorf> $(".services-sidebar ul li a").addClass("active")  <--- that?
[13:44:58] <wathek> how can I select a child item after I use the parent() function ?
[13:45:26] <johnkpaul> ?children @wathek
[13:45:27] <bot-t> wathek, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/

[14:00:53] <azk> is this viable?
[14:01:10] <jwg2s> hey all, was hoping someone could help me diagnose a glitch i'm having with a hover function
[14:01:11] <jwg2s> http://24.125.42.135/
[14:01:19] <jwg2s> if you hover over login, it kind of flashes white
[14:01:23] <jwg2s> wondering how i could get rid of that
[14:02:53] <thinced> jwg2s: preload that image?
[14:02:57] <LessSeen> Warning: SplFileInfo::openFile(/Users/jwg2s/Sites/m76/app/tmp/cache/persistent/myapp_cake_core_cake_console....
[14:03:06] <LessSeen> it only happens the first time so just preload the image
[14:03:15] <jwg2s> ah ok
[14:03:29] <jwg2s> thought i had successfully preloaded already but i guess not
[14:04:02] <jwg2s> misspelled directory, doh
[14:04:13] <jwg2s> is it possible to animate a css background image change?
[14:09:25] <gho5t> most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality (For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless the jQuery.Color() plugin is used).
[14:13:30] <azk> can I pass variables between deferred objects?
[14:14:20] <shoky> azk whacha mean
[14:15:10] <shoky> and what the hell is:
[14:15:10] <shoky> for (i in data.rows) {
[14:15:11] <shoky> 				return by_counter.promise()
[14:15:11] <shoky> 			}
[14:15:26] <azk> good question
[14:15:56] <azk> I need to call the db and for each row fire a callback basically
[14:16:15] <shoky> fire what callback?
[14:16:57] <azk> the thing called function
[14:17:16] <shoky> that does what?
[14:17:40] <azk> not written yet, but that's another db vquery based on a variable inside this one
[14:18:02] <shoky> sounds fishy but ok
[14:18:08] <shoky> so fire yer callbacks
[14:18:16] <shoky> why are you returning promises .. in a loop ?
[14:18:19] <azk> I'm just trying to wrap my head around this
[14:18:26] <shoky> ok
[14:18:28] <azk> shoky: I honestly don't know
[14:18:51] <azk> I need to fire a callback for each row I get from the query
[14:19:21] <shoky> if you had to name this callback, what would you name it?
[14:19:37] <azk> by_ssl
[14:20:05] <shoky> so for each row, you want to run: by_ssl() ?
[14:20:28] <azk> yes
[14:20:29] <shoky> or, for each row 'i', you want to call: by_ssl(i)  ?
[14:20:36] <shoky> then go for it!
[14:20:44] <shoky> no returning promises in a loop plz
[14:20:44] <azk> so it makes sense?
[14:20:47] <azk> ok
[14:20:49] <shoky> what does
[14:21:19] <azk> oh nvm
[14:21:42] <Gsingh> when you pass something like $(htmlElement) is it takeing the the DOM element and converting it a jQuery object?
[14:22:28] <shoky> it isn't converting it into anything
[14:22:33] <shoky> the dom element is still a dom element
[14:23:00] <Gsingh> I mean like wrapping it
[14:23:13] <shoky> pretty much
[14:23:22] <Gsingh> ok
[14:23:28] <Gsingh> sorry I asked that wrong
[14:23:39] <shoky> im sure the docs phrase it better than us..
[14:25:05] <jael> lol
[14:25:20] <shoky> LOL
[14:49:09] <PoeticIntensity> I am at my wits' end.  I've worked with jquery for years, and I cannot get a simple Jquery UI "tab" implementation to work at all.  Google provides little to no help.  I'm obviously missing something small, but right now, it's all I can do to keep from bashing my computer in with a hammer.
[14:49:16] <Tasser> are drag/drop pointer-events as well?
[14:49:17] <PoeticIntensity> Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[14:49:41] <PoeticIntensity> I have successfully implemented a sortable function with no problems in the same system.
[14:50:07] <PoeticIntensity> I'm getting no JS errors, and I've verified through firebug that the proper classes are being assigned to the "tabs" in the ordered list.
[14:50:31] <ngharo> did you include jquery-ui css?
[14:50:36] <PoeticIntensity> the display information is acting the same as if there were no call to jquery at all.
[14:51:11] <PoeticIntensity> ngharo, I haven't included any css at all.  I have the understanding that this won't hinder the functionality of the application, rather it will just make it look bad.
[14:51:41] <PoeticIntensity> do tabs depend on the Jquery-UI CSS?
[14:51:51] <supsup> for look yah
[14:51:57] <supsup> u got jsfiddle example
[14:52:11] <PoeticIntensity> I'm not familiar with jsfiddle.... I'll give it a looksie...
[14:52:13] <Ddorda> hey guys. i'm trying to use $.get. i saw there's an option to send data to the request page. is it $_POST? $_GET?
[14:52:34] <ngharo> PoeticIntensity: for a UI library, i'd say yes, the css is required
[14:52:38] <supsup> u can include jquery ui with checkboxes in jsfiddle.  might have to refrence the css file tho.
[14:53:43] <rroelofs> Ddorda: if you use .get they are get prams
[14:54:08] <PoeticIntensity> ngharo, you wouldn't happen to have a link to simple css which would make or break the tabs, would ya?
[14:54:39] <ngharo> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.19/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[14:54:51] <PoeticIntensity> thank you!
[14:54:54] <PoeticIntensity> I'll implement that now.
[14:55:02] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/nSe4z/
[14:55:08] <Ddorda> rroelofs: so if i use: $.get('dataGen.php', { 'ken' : ken }, 'json'); i need to have $_GET['ken'] in dataGen.php?
[14:55:25] <supsup> yah notice the Managed Resources
[14:56:12] <ngharo> Ddorda: yes
[14:56:53] <PoeticIntensity> holy hannah, ngharo, you were right!  With the CSS, it's working like a charm...
[14:56:58] <PoeticIntensity> Gonna blog about this right now.
[14:58:16] <PoeticIntensity> no where on google did it even hint that the css was required.... (nor on the Jquery-UI site, that I could find)
[14:58:45] <ngharo> when you download, it builds a package with a theme
[14:59:29] <supsup> Poetic it's in all their downloads
[14:59:33] <ajpiano> PoeticIntensity: http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started
[14:59:34] <supsup> if you just look at source code
[14:59:36] <supsup> it's pretty obvious
[14:59:50] <ajpiano> the "basic overview" explains that you need to include the css and js
[15:00:19] <PoeticIntensity> good to know!  I guess I need to read more....  I've used jquery for years, but I guess I never needed the css.
[15:00:22] <PoeticIntensity> before.
[15:00:28] <ajpiano> jquery doesn't have css, jquery ui does though :)
[15:00:45] <PoeticIntensity> I see.
[15:00:52] <PoeticIntensity> very, very good to know.  Thanks, guys!
[15:01:29] <supsup> ajpiano u going to txjs this year?
[15:01:32] <ajpiano> yes
[15:01:35] <supsup> cool
[15:02:11] <supsup> odd dates this year compared to previous, but i can deal.
[15:03:09] <shumoo> Hi, looking for some opinions on training classes for jQuery...does anyone have a recommendation?
[15:03:42] <supsup> jQuery in Action is decent. though outdated for 1.7 not much tho
[15:03:44] <ajpiano> shumoo: i'm a bit partial cause i work there but http://training.bocoup.com/
[15:04:07] <shumoo> i saw you had a class coming up may 9th
[15:04:15] <shumoo> is that correct?
[15:04:28] <ajpiano> yep, rworth is teaching it ^^
[15:05:14] <supsup> you teaching them jquery before js?
[15:05:15] <sf2newbieForYa> I have an alert now on select change, how to grab the checkbox right next to this select field and check it?
[15:05:16] <shumoo> I have some team members who will be coming with me that only have SQL Server experience with little to no javascript knowledge
[15:05:53] <sf2newbieForYa> or actually just should check the value is not null and make the text field right next to it appear
[15:05:57] <shumoo> will the class be able to give them an better understanding of how jQuery works or should they take the pre-req on may 30th?
[15:06:13] <supsup> you should teach them js first then go over jquery.
[15:06:35] <shumoo> I figured, we're in a time crunch for the 9th in that case
[15:06:42] <ajpiano> shumoo: there is some pretty serious intro to JS content in the jquery training
[15:06:53] <ajpiano> however if they have never coded JS before, a full class on it couldn't hurt
[15:07:05] <shumoo> right, i think that's appropriate
[15:07:15] <shumoo> the js class is on the 30th
[15:07:40] <shumoo> and I didn't see a date after that for jQuery, only on the 9th before
[15:07:53] <shumoo> do you know the next class date for jQuery?
[15:08:02] <sf2newbieForYa> how to get the next tag element with jquery?
[15:08:13] <sf2newbieForYa> i am on $(this) and it is a select
[15:08:14] <ajpiano> sf2newbieForYa: next() or nextAll() depending what you need to do
[15:08:22] <sf2newbieForYa> thanks man
[15:08:29] <ajpiano> shumoo: we also do custom corporate trainings for teams and stuff like that
[15:08:50] <shumoo> what's the cost of something like that for 3 people?
[15:08:51] <ajpiano> shumoo: and will be doing jquery training before the jquery conference in san francisco in late june
[15:09:16] <ajpiano> shumoo:i'm not sure, you should get in touch w/ us
[15:09:18] <supsup> shumoo i'm sure on their site they got a contact us setup
[15:09:22] <ajpiano> yea
[15:09:24] <Whirl3d> Afternoon all. If I am using  .each to cycle through an array of literal objects, "this" refers to each object literal, correct?
[15:09:29] <sf2newbieForYa> how to remove the css class? $(this).next().css.removeAttr('class', 'initial-hide') ?
[15:09:43] <ajpiano> sf2newbieForYa: .removeClass("initial-hide")
[15:09:56] <ajpiano> $(this).next().removeClass("initial-hide")
[15:10:05] <sf2newbieForYa> thanks man
[15:10:17] <shumoo> thanks guys, i appreciate your time! just want to clarify, other than may 9th is there another date for jquery training?
[15:10:27] <tomsthumb_> I don't believe it is, but is possible to attach on click callback to elements that aren't in the dom yet?
[15:10:58] <supsup> the hardest thing i have with new members who know other langs is not setting up training, but them actually wanting to be trained.
[15:11:02] <tomsthumb_> ie $("<selector>") wouldn't return anything at this point
[15:11:05] <ajpiano> shumoo: http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/
[15:11:16] <ajpiano> tomsthumb_: through event delegation it is possible to do that
[15:11:24] <ajpiano> it's not "attaching" a click callback, it uses event bublbing
[15:11:37] <ajpiano> $(document).on("click", ".someSelector", function() { });
[15:12:38] <supsup> ajpiano is there performance advantage to be more specific on first selector with on?  I'm not on 1.7 yet so just curious.
[15:12:40] <tomsthumb_> ajpiano: even if the selector doesn't match anything right now, but it will later? that's pretty nice
[15:13:04] <ajpiano> supsup: yes, if you know it's contained to a particular area it's better to use a closer container
[15:13:06] <tomsthumb_> ajpiano: why would you choose that way over $(<selector>).delegate(<stuff>)
[15:13:07] <ajpiano> tomsthumb_: yep
[15:13:15] <supsup> so like delegate. cool thanks
[15:13:19] <ajpiano> tomsthumb_: on and delegate are the exact same thing
[15:13:25] <tw2113> afternoon all
[15:13:26] <ajpiano> on is the successor to delegate
[15:13:40] <ajpiano> they just have slightly different method signatures, delegate just calls on
[15:13:58] <tomsthumb_> ajpiano: ahhh, i see. well cool and thank you much
[15:14:21] <supsup> on is successor of click etc as well?  some guy who just wrote a book on async ajax was saying that was a bit confused by it, he said it was some sub pub model.  I prob read it wrong.
[15:14:34] <supsup> async javascript not ajax
[15:14:59] <ajpiano> supsup: click is also just a shortcut to on, yes
[15:15:13] <ajpiano> $("#foo").click(fn) is the same as $("#foo").on("click', fn);
[15:15:26] <supsup> yah he listed out a number of events that are in 1.7 just defered to .on in backend now.  thought it was kind of interesting
[15:16:03] <Whirl3d> afternoon tw2113.
[15:16:13] <supsup> PubSub not subpub also doh
[15:17:38] <supsup> "Of course, PubSub implementations vary slightly feature-wise. When the jQery team noticed that  several different PubSub implementations were being used throughout the library, they decided to  abstract them with $.Callbacks in jQery 1.7."
[15:19:17] <tab1293> anyone know of a good plugin that can style form elements to look better?
[15:20:26] <zatan_> hey is there opposite anything for FadeTo ?
[15:20:45] <acidjazz> ur mom
[15:20:48] <acidjazz> theres ur mom
[15:26:38] <supsup> zatan not really sure what you mean.
[15:27:55] <supsup> Zatan: maybe: http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/fading/  tho not sure what your asking so just a guess.  I'm about to roll out
[15:29:10] <zatan_> supsup, its okay I have managed to with animate({opacity: 0.0}, 400, 'linear',function() { cheers
[15:29:53] <LessSeen> why not just fadeOut ?
[15:36:45] <Trisox> any one here uses knockout?
[15:50:18] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Did Google break it's position:fixed support in 2.3.5+? Help us test: https://t.co/T6oxi2uQ ★ http://bit.ly/JaQ2Q5
[15:56:36] <Whirl3d> so, jQuery has several methods (most really, I think) that return new jQuery objects. What happens to the originating jQuery object and why doesn't it suck up memory?
[15:56:42] <zatan_> LessSeen,  as I dont want to do "display:none"
[15:57:32] <Whirl3d> ah, wait. It's because it's in a closure which is garbage collected as a temporary object, right?
[16:02:41] * Whirl3d cracks open the jquery source files to gain some insight, hopefully
[16:07:17] <imsky> wooo
[16:12:47] <gaius65> How can I exclude an element from the current jQuery set?
[16:13:08] <gaius65> something like $('#main > *').without('.loader')
[16:13:25] <ajpiano> ?not
[16:13:25] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[16:15:44] <gaius65> ajpiano: thanks!
[16:22:40] <gaius65> Is there a way to figure out how big an element would need to be to not have a scrollbar/overflow?
[16:32:50] <batdorf> :what IRC client are most people using?
[16:33:24] <gaius65> batdorf: I'm using colloquy
[16:34:05] <batdorf> thanks
[16:34:15] <ML74> i have a jquery image scroller on my site. how can i stop all the images showing as the page loads?
[16:34:25] <ManxPower> I'm still a bit of a JS/jQuery n00b.  If I use $.ajax() to get xml data to parse with parseXML() what should the dataType be in the ajax call?  I don't know if my data is bad or something else is wrong.  If I set it to 'xml' jsonPARSE gives me "Invalid XML: [object Document]"
[16:34:52] <batdorf> gaius65: just read your question. maybe get the height of the window?
[16:36:11] <gaius65> batdorf: I mean something different, when I have e.g. <div id="wrapper" style="width:300px"><div stlye="width:200px"><div stlye="width:400px"></div> I would like to get 400px
[16:38:14] <batdorf> gaius65: you want to access the css property?
[16:42:13] <batdorf>  don't know the structure of your html, but you should be able to do ("div").css("width"), but you have to be sure you select the correct div element
[16:42:48] <batdorf> check the jQuery api page for .css()
[16:42:52] <gaius65> batdorf: I'm asking if there is a more performant solution of this: http://pastebin.com/HuSHxZVW
[16:42:55] <Whirl3d> ML74, just set the container opacity to 0 until all images are loaded and then set it back to 100%
[16:43:46] <gaius65> batdorf: sry, wrong url: http://pastebin.com/GBeWhyZQ
[16:44:11] <ML74> Whirl3d: Cheers :)
[16:44:36] <batdorf> what exactly is your end goal?
[16:45:08] <Whirl3d> ManxPower, if you set it to "xml" and then use jsonPARSE on it, isn't that a problem since your XML is not JSON?
[16:45:10] <batdorf> i mean, you could use toggleClass()
[16:46:12] <ManxPower> Ther is no JSON involved.  The data handed back is text/xml and is pure xml (or should be)
[16:46:28] <ManxPower> not json parse, parseSML
[16:46:51] <batdorf> or, you want to store the height into a  variable?
[16:47:06] <Whirl3d> I thought maybe that was your problem based on your question. I haven't used jquery to parse XML so I'm not goig to be able to help, sorry.
[16:47:41] <ManxPower> Whirl3d: neither have  I. 8-)
[16:48:30] <Whirl3d> I have a function that returns a deferred object's promise and I would like to change the context of the callbacks added to the deferred through .done, .then. or .always. can I achieve this with .resolveWith() or .rejectWith()?
[16:48:33] <shippy> quick q.. why won't this bit of jquery code fade the #monster divs? http://pastebin.com/CVks38Rr
[16:49:20] <batdorf> isn't there a .parseXML() method in the api?
[16:49:56] <ManxPower> batdorf: Yes. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/  This is what my question is about.
[16:50:45] <Whirl3d> shippy, you don't have a "monster" element until your getJSON callback is handled. But in your code, you try to call the hide().fadeIn() functions on it right after requesting the getJSON...It's a problem with asynchronous loading
[16:51:11] <Whirl3d> YOu have to put your fadeIn methods inside your callback, after you append the monster element,
[16:52:42] <shippy> Whirl3d: I get it.. i thought that since that piece of JS was after the getJSON function, it would be OK.. but unless it is in a callback I should assume that everything gets loading at once?
[16:53:48] <xp_prg> hi all, I am very confused why my page is saying it can't find a javascript function when I do have it defined, any ideas?
[16:54:33] <Whirl3d> Sort of. I may be hearing your wrong, but the idea behind asynchronos functions is that things can be going on inside the asynchronous call while the rest of your code is running.
[16:55:44] <Whirl3d> so if you have three lines of code and the first is an asynchronos call, the second fires immediately without waiting for the first one to finish.
[16:56:20] <Whirl3d> xp_prrg, check to be sure that jquery is loading
[16:56:45] <xp_prg> jquery is loading cuz I see my jquery ui DataTAble
[16:57:21] <bartmax> plain js, i have a list of objects with an attribute id inside, what is the fastest way to do a 'find by id' ?
[16:57:28] <Whirl3d> xp_prg, than this is an ideal time to invoke the beauty of jsfiddle. There's no way for us to divine the problems with your specific code. Setup a fiddle and ask back.
[16:57:49] <xp_prg> ok
[16:58:01] <bartmax> or to convert to an 'dictionary' using the id as a key
[16:58:23] <Whirl3d> bartmax, you have a list of dom elements or just plain objects?
[16:58:29] <bartmax> Whirl3d: plain objects
[16:59:06] <shippy> Whirl3d: I see.. so in this case, the call to fade it just happens to be running before the divs with id #monster are in the DOM.  What if I add a delay to the fade?  would that work?
[16:59:20] <Whirl3d> I am not sure about this, but you could use $.map(objectList, function (obj, i) {if (obj.id==val) {return obj;} return null});
[16:59:42] <bartmax> what will that returns Whirl3d ?
[16:59:47] <Whirl3d> shippy, why not put it in the callback.
[17:00:10] <Whirl3d> bartmax the object with id=val, I believe
[17:00:11] <shippy> Whirl3d: I will.. I just wanted to throw out a follow-up example to make sure I fully understand why this doesn't work
[17:00:26] <bartmax> isnt that expensive? i need to do it like 2000 times
[17:00:43] <bartmax> i guess convert to something with a key will be better i guess...
[17:00:46] <Whirl3d> Sounds like you got it. The problem with a delay is that you would have to delay the handler assignment until the monster element was created
[17:00:57] <Whirl3d> otherwise it would fail.
[17:01:33] <shippy> I see.. so even if I chain a delay onto the end of the fade, it's still trying to select the element right away
[17:01:36] <shippy> so that would fail also
[17:01:48] <Whirl3d> I believe so.
[17:01:53] <shippy> awesome.. makes perfect sense
[17:01:56] <shippy> thanks Whirl3d !
[17:01:59] <Whirl3d> np.
[17:02:48] <Whirl3d> bartmax, I am not aware of any other methods for searching through an array of elements to return one with a single value
[17:02:59] <bartmax> ok
[17:03:00] <bartmax> thanks
[17:03:09] <Whirl3d> What areyou trying to do, maybe there's a better way around it?
[17:06:18] <batdorf> document.getElementsBySelector  ?
[17:06:43] <batdorf> document.getElementsByID
[17:06:46] <batdorf> not selector
[17:07:13] <Whirl3d> huh?
[17:07:20] <batdorf> bartmax: is this what you want?
[17:07:27] <Whirl3d> they aren't in the document
[17:07:38] <batdorf> ah I see
[17:07:40] <Whirl3d> they are javascript objects
[17:07:56] <Whirl3d> even then, you'd use $("#"+id); to get by id.
[17:08:00] <bartmax> batdorf: nevermind, i 'kinda' did it already
[17:08:20] <bartmax> and no, im using plain objects not dom elements
[17:08:36] <batdorf> Whirl3d: in jQuery, but I thought he was asking about javascript
[17:09:35] <bartmax> jQuery IS javascript :)
[17:09:45] <batdorf> did you figure it out bartmax ? if not you could try pasting the code
[17:10:06] <bartmax> yes im converting to a 'hashtable' beforehand and using the index of the object
[17:10:58] <batdorf> actually, I'm trying to figure out something similar
[17:17:32] <Whirl3d> Okay, here's another weird one. I am always writing anonymous functions like function () {$(this).hide(3000);} to satisfy the need to return a function in a callback, for example. What if you wrote a function like: function do (func) {return function () {func.call()}}   could you then have callbacks like: $(this).show("fast",do($(this).css("opacity",.5}));
[17:18:20] <jrockjiggz> Whirl3d: jquery has a null function ?noop
[17:18:24] <jrockjiggz> ?noop
[17:18:24] <bot-t> jQuery.noop(): An empty function. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noop/
[17:18:53] <dragon> ?merge
[17:18:53] <bot-t> jQuery.merge(first, second): Merge the contents of two arrays together into the first array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.merge/
[17:19:09] <Whirl3d> jrockjiggz, but that's gonna return an empty function. I need to return a curried function? (I'm using curry as a guess, mind you)
[17:20:40] <Whirl3d> like i would use $.noop in the second half of a then callback: deferred.then(success, $.noop);
[17:21:09] <Whirl3d> because the second function is required for the Deferred.then method
[17:22:33] <Whirl3d> wait, couldn't I just enclose the internal function in ()....does () satisfy the need for a function?
[17:23:03] <Whirl3d> deferred.then(($(this).hide()),$.noop)?
[17:24:16] <bartmax> if I have a list of objects (plain js) of 100 objects
[17:24:22] <bartmax> is there a way to get only the first 10 ?
[17:24:23] <bartmax> slice ?
[17:24:35] <Whirl3d> sure, why not?
[17:24:41] <bartmax> slice(0,10) ?
[17:24:47] <aghouseh> anyone have an idea why i'd be getting two 'LAST' items in a row with this function? http://pastebin.com/1MxVd16R
[17:25:07] <aghouseh> trying to detect 'rows' from floated items within a container
[17:25:09] <Whirl3d> or maybe slice (0,9) since the tenth item is id=9
[17:25:15] <bartmax> ty Whirl3d
[17:27:47] <Whirl3d> aghouseh, so you are checking each element to see if it's out of order based on it's offset top, right?
[17:28:06] <aghouseh> right im just comparing it to next and prev to determine if its rendering below / above
[17:28:49] <Whirl3d> as a side note, cache j$(this)
[17:28:59] <aghouseh> ah yes
[17:29:14] <Whirl3d> line 3, should be something like var elem=j$(this);   it will save a lot of lookups
[17:29:25] <aghouseh> got it
[17:29:25] <aghouseh> yea
[17:30:11] <aghouseh> so yeah the 'first' class works
[17:30:16] <aghouseh> but the 'last' is always going to the last two items
[17:30:36] <Whirl3d> Yeah, and you could end up with lots of first and last elements
[17:30:45] <aghouseh> hm
[17:30:56] <Whirl3d> perhaps you could hash the top values and sort them, like this:
[17:31:08] <aghouseh> This: 770/ Next: 770
[17:31:15] <aghouseh> ive got an alert when it matches one
[17:32:17] <Whirl3d> var positions=$("li").map(function (elem, i) {return {top:elem.position().top, elem:elem}});
[17:32:39] <aghouseh> hm
[17:32:48] <Whirl3d> which would give you an array of objects {top:num, elem:element);
[17:32:56] <aghouseh> not familiar with map()
[17:32:58] <aghouseh> ic
[17:33:34] <Whirl3d> map is a lot like each, but it returns a value for each element or null if the function wants.
[17:33:41] <caleon> so is it supposed to find out which element starts and row and which ends a row? as in, they are floated left, perhaps?
[17:33:52] <aghouseh> yes caleon
[17:33:58] <aghouseh> basically trying to detect floated 'rows'
[17:34:01] <aghouseh> for stylign
[17:34:02] <aghouseh> styling
[17:34:35] <Whirl3d> is there any reason to think they would be out of dom order?
[17:34:43] <aghouseh> no
[17:34:52] <Whirl3d> then why not $("li").first()
[17:34:58] <Whirl3d> and $("li").last();
[17:35:07] <caleon> there can be multiple firsts and lasts
[17:35:11] <aghouseh> because its a variable quantity product listing
[17:35:12] <aghouseh> yeah
[17:35:25] <aghouseh> they just float left and fit however many per row
[17:35:37] <caleon> one of each per row. if the number of elements in each row is static, it would be easier, but i assume that can change
[17:35:52] <aghouseh> right thats how it is now, but i want it to be more flexible
[17:36:18] <nod_> hello :)
[17:36:24] <Whirl3d> you could easily figure out how many elements in a row, then divide the total elements by that number and the modulus would be the bottom row
[17:36:47] <nod_> got a question about the whole mobile/roadmap situation, can someone point me to the right people/place please?
[17:36:51] <Whirl3d> var btmCount=$("li").length%itemsPerRow;
[17:37:31] <Whirl3d> var last=$("li").gt($("li").length-btmCount);
[17:37:48] <aghouseh> Whirl3d: but we dont know how many items per row
[17:38:03] <Whirl3d> so each row may have a different number of items.
[17:38:25] <aghouseh> they would all have the same, but that could vary based on browser width
[17:38:29] <Whirl3d> I see, I thought you meant that each row had the same, unknown number, of elements.
[17:38:40] <caleon> for one thing, if the last item in the entire set happens at the end of its row, wouldn't it be missing the expected "last" class?
[17:38:42] <aghouseh> no, that's correct
[17:39:01] <aghouseh> caleon: that's ok. it's for tightening up the margin, actually.
[17:39:03] <Whirl3d> var itemsPerRow=$("container").width()/$("li").first().width();
[17:39:05] <aghouseh> caleon: but yeah.
[17:39:15] <aghouseh> hm
[17:39:40] <Whirl3d> probably want to add Math.floor() to it
[17:39:42] <imsky> woo
[17:39:58] <aghouseh> i guess that's a bit more straight-forward
[17:40:14] <Whirl3d> but that should give you the total number of elements per row, then divide the total by that number to determine the number of rows, the last items, and the first items
[17:40:29] <aghouseh> nod
[17:41:24] <Whirl3d> if they were all custom widths, perhaps you could use .map to map them into rows, then select the first and last rows.
[17:41:24] <caleon> is it possible that when you get to the very last element and it does .next() on it, it matches a blank text node?
[17:41:33] <caleon> like a carriage return between </li> and </ul>?
[17:41:40] <aghouseh> hm
[17:41:46] <aghouseh> yeah true i should do next('li
[17:41:51] <aghouseh> maybe thats all i needed hah
[17:42:40] <aghouseh> hm that wasnt it :)
[17:48:55] <caleon> for one i would have made it $('.product_grid > li') instead of .find because that might go for li nested deeper, and then making "var" declarations within the loop, but also
[17:49:24] <caleon> is it possible that in setting a "first" class to an item, the CSS makes the margin tweaked, and then the $next element is shifted in the process?
[17:50:56] <aghouseh> yeah ive since put var declarations in and its impossible eto have nested LIs
[17:51:03] <aghouseh> its product listing with an image and link inside each.. very controlled
[17:51:20] <aghouseh> caleon: hmm good question about the css though!
[17:51:32] <caleon> but it's hard to imagine the fringe case that would trigger that
[17:52:21] <Whirl3d> You could just do the map sort like I mentioned then to select the bottom row, get all elements like $("li[top=maxpos]") and all first row would be $("li[top=minpos]");
[17:53:24] <caleon> i guess the fringe case would depend on the size and margin adjustment of an item, but if there is an element at the end of its row, and it gets applied the "last" class,
[17:53:37] <caleon> and in adjusting its margin-right, the next item which was to fall on the next row gets popped up to the previous row,
[17:53:50] <caleon> then it could also get applied the "next" class
[17:54:31] <aghouseh> yeah
[17:55:52] <caleon> like Whril3D is suggesting, there might be a better way to handle this sort of logic. i was just puzzled to see why that snippet would even behave contrary to expectations
[17:56:04] <aghouseh> i think you're right its the css
[17:57:01] <aghouseh> yup
[18:01:15] <Whirl3d> I'm getting some jquery error, but here is the idea that I had: http://jsfiddle.net/YcgtR/5/
[18:01:44] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/YcgtR/6/
[18:01:59] <Whirl3d> sorry, I always get (elem, i) messed up in map
[18:02:13] <mappum> how would I get the tag type of an element? e.g. a <input /> should return 'input'
[18:02:29] <caleon> el.nodeName => "INPUT"
[18:02:35] <mappum> word, thanks
[18:02:49] <caleon> works on regular DOM element though, i think, not the jquery object
[18:03:06] <mappum> hm
[18:03:13] <aghouseh> yea jq i think you need $elem.get(0).tagName;
[18:03:21] <mappum> ok
[18:03:30] <caleon> oh, tagName, i was wrong
[18:03:33] <aghouseh> i just did that for an IE rendering debugger i thought up
[18:03:37] <arnpro> is there any method besides live() to add an event to an html element? Id like to do the event definitions of a #button in an html, and then throught an ajax call, pull some other #button elements, and have them applied with the same event
[18:03:48] <aghouseh> just a script that generates a log of all rendered items and their widths
[18:03:55] <aghouseh> i ran it in IE and FF and diff'd the output
[18:04:10] <caleon> .on or .delegate?
[18:04:30] <aghouseh> yea isnt .on() the suggested one now?
[18:04:43] <aghouseh> im stuck using 1.4.2 on a lot of the sites i work on, so i cant get into that fanciness
[18:05:01] <imsky> lol
[18:05:04] <acidjazz> aghouseh: you know what im getting quite sick of your attitude
[18:05:17] <imsky> "stuck on 1.4.2"
[18:05:18] <arnpro> caleon is that answer for me?
[18:05:48] <aghouseh> acidjazz: ok.
[18:05:54] <caleon> i'm not sure what issue you're trying to avoid by using something besides "live", but "on" or "delegate" should be able to achieve something similar
[18:06:31] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/YcgtR/8/
[18:06:39] <Whirl3d> works better now.
[18:06:58] <aghouseh> oh Whirl3d! im trying to detect the COLUMN not the ROW! :O
[18:07:09] <aghouseh> sorry for the confusion
[18:07:11] <Whirl3d> You suck
[18:07:16] <aghouseh> last item within a given column
[18:07:17] <aghouseh> er row
[18:07:19] <aghouseh> yeah, sorry man!
[18:07:41] <aghouseh> guess thats why acidjazz is getting sick of my attitude (? hah)
[18:07:58] <arnpro> caleon, thinking about performance... because there's going to be many dom elements with events attached to it, coming and going, so I thought there should be something better than live()
[18:08:32] <Whirl3d> arnpro, use .on on your parent element
[18:08:34] <aghouseh> ive not used those much, but when i do, i just scope down as much as possible
[18:09:02] <arnpro> will do, thanks !
[18:09:11] <caleon> what Whirl3d said: parent.on('click', [selector for specific child], function() {…}))
[18:13:07] <aghouseh> thanks for the help, guys. you're aces!
[18:13:45] <arnpro> men down
[18:14:03] <McSquibs> hey i have a link where i dont want it to redirect me to another page how do i do this?
[18:14:38] <Wilornel> $('#link').click( function(event){ event.preventDefault(); });
[18:14:53] <Wilornel> or you can do: <a href='#'>the Link</a>
[18:14:54] <McSquibs> ive tried that but it is not working for me
[18:15:28] <Wilornel> did you try the second one?
[18:15:36] <McSquibs> yeah the #
[18:15:41] <Wilornel> works?
[18:15:59] <McSquibs> yeah
[18:16:06] <Wilornel> cool
[18:16:49] <McSquibs> bec im using ajax to write it to the page but then it couldn't preventDefault() to the link
[18:17:03] <Wilornel> wait
[18:17:08] <Wilornel> you added the link dynamically?
[18:17:12] <McSquibs> yeah
[18:17:16] <Wilornel> then try that :
[18:17:24] <McSquibs> try what?
[18:17:31] <Wilornel> $('#link').on('click', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); });
[18:17:43] <McSquibs> ive tried that and it doesn't work
[18:17:48] <Wilornel> if it doesnt work, try this, but it's deprecated so idk if its okay with you:
[18:17:52] <Wilornel> $('#link').live('click', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); });
[18:18:31] <batdorf> the former should work... check for typos? can you paste your code?
[18:18:44] <caleon> if it's added dynamically you would need to re-attach event handlers or delegate the event from an ancestor that isn't dynamically added
[18:18:47] <Wilornel> the former one??
[18:19:18] <Wilornel> also, mcSquibs do you know what is the console? Did you try any console.log? Are there errors?
[18:19:28] <McSquibs> ill check
[18:19:58] <batdorf> what caleon said
[18:20:28] <Wilornel> oh yeah, how would it work? You have to ('#link').bind('click'); ??
[18:20:47] <Wilornel> because I tested that thing before and it did not work..
[18:20:59] <caleon> $('body').on('click', '#link', function(e) { e.preventDefault() }) if you want to start at the body tag
[18:22:39] <Wilornel> oohh I see
[18:23:42] <McSquibs> its still redirects with lastest
[18:24:33] <McSquibs> is there a way to inline onclick with jquery script?
[18:24:37] <batdorf> use deligate?
[18:24:53] <McSquibs> what?
[18:27:10] <batdorf> well, im not following the entire conversation, but it sounds like you want to use deligate so the newly created elements contain the same attributes as the clone
[18:27:37] <batdorf> al these join/parts and quits get in the way of my text! arg
[18:28:32] <McSquibs> no the link that gets created i want it not to redirect to its 'href' and instead do the .click() function
[18:29:35] <systemfault> McSquibs: You can easily call event.preventDefault() for that
[18:30:07] <McSquibs> no i doesn't work ive tried it a bunch of times
[18:30:18] <McSquibs> im using ajax to write it to the page
[18:30:29] <caleon> mcsquibs if you scroll up there is a delegate example. otherwise, you can try "return false;" in place of e.preventDefault() just to check, or
[18:30:46] <McSquibs> i've tried that as well
[18:30:55] <McSquibs> this was like my last resort
[18:30:56] <caleon> depending on how the elements are structured, there might be an event that takes precendence and doesn't even let the event get to your new handler
[18:31:28] <caleon> *there might be an _event handler_
[18:32:52] <caleon> as for inline jquery, depending on how you add it: $('<a href="…">link</a>').appendTo('body').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault() })
[18:34:32] <McSquibs> im talking like <a href='#' onclick='jquery goes here?'>Link</a>
[18:35:11] <caleon> onclick="return false;" maybe
[18:35:20] <McSquibs> ill try
[18:35:56] <coldhead> McSquibs: i beg you not to use onClick
[18:36:01] <coldhead> it's not the jQuery way
[18:36:06] <McSquibs> haha
[18:36:07] <coldhead> it makes john resig cry
[18:36:40] <McSquibs> but in this situation the click isn't working because the link is dynamically created
[18:37:06] <coldhead> ?on @ McSquibs
[18:37:06] <bot-t> McSquibs, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:37:13] <coldhead> that's what on() is for
[18:37:21] <McSquibs> and onclick='return false;' worked but jquery didn't work
[18:37:26] <coldhead> you can bind to elements that don't even exist yet
[18:37:57] <McSquibs> so how would that look for a link??
[18:38:05] <Whirl3d> Okay, here's another weird one. I am always writing anonymous functions like function () {$(this).hide(3000);} to satisfy the need to return a function in a callback, for example. What if you wrote a function like: function do (func) {return function () {func.call()}}   could you then have callbacks like: $(this).show("fast",do($(this).css("opacity",.5}));
[18:38:11] <raj> how can I send multiple files in a single request with IE?
[18:38:17] <raj> I'm told I need multiple file input fields
[18:38:27] <raj> and js
[18:38:31] <raj> trickery
[18:38:59] <coldhead> McSquibs: $('a.someLinkClass').on('click', function (e) {e.preventDefault();})
[18:39:07] <coldhead> or you can return false;
[18:39:16] <coldhead> preventDefault makes it clearer what you're doing
[18:40:06] <batdorf> doesn't return false do more than just preventDefault()?
[18:40:34] <chee> it also returns false
[18:40:41] <coldhead> chee++
[18:40:50] <coldhead> Whirl3d: that won't work
[18:40:55] <coldhead> for interesting reasons
[18:41:10] <coldhead> it would work if .css() etc returned a function
[18:41:12] <caleon> return false does both preventDefault and stopPropagation
[18:41:12] <coldhead> but it doesn't
[18:41:20] <coldhead> it will be evaulated immediately
[18:41:33] <coldhead> Whirl3d: i think you'd have to pass the css()y bit in as a string
[18:41:35] <McSquibs> still not working
[18:41:36] <coldhead> and have it evaled
[18:41:40] <coldhead> which is gross
[18:42:22] <coldhead> raj: you should use something like https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload otherwise it's a world of pain
[18:43:08] <raj> coldhead, that's what I'm doing
[18:43:31] <raj> but I don't understand this https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/issues/995
[18:43:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #995 on jQuery-File-Upload (tiyr; 2m, 2w ago): Single request in IE
[18:44:16] <coldhead> ugh, that looks slightly painful, raj
[18:44:25] <coldhead> but less annoying than doing it from scratch
[18:44:33] <raj> yeah, but I have no choice
[18:44:34] <coldhead> does the solution in the comments help you?
[18:44:40] <raj> I need IE to post multiple files in a single request
[18:44:46] <raj> I just don't understand what's going on
[18:45:07] <coldhead> tiyr's refinement of the fix looks readable
[18:45:40] <raj> coldhead, for example, here's my code http://68.46.138.78:8080/asdf (asdf:asdf to login and then click Change Picture)
[18:47:36] <shippy> any hints as to why this won't work?
[18:47:37] <shippy> http://pastebin.com/fE9TRTX9
[18:49:12] <caleon> i think the function provided to your $.each needs the single item as first parameter and the index as second
[18:49:31] <shippy> caleon: the json stuff works, it's the fade that isn't registering
[18:49:32] <caleon> or wait the other way
[18:49:38] <shippy> fade on id #monster
[18:49:39] <caleon> ah, ok
[18:50:04] <coldhead> raj: i don't have IE to test for you
[18:50:05] <shippy> oh wait, i think i know what i did wrong
[18:50:07] <raj> coldhead, it just uses your last added picture (I'll eventually get to having a page with all the uploaded pictures)
[18:50:23] <coldhead> raj: i don't understand why you want to submit multiple images for a single avatar picture
[18:50:44] <raj> coldhead, but even still, how would I integrate that code with what i've got?
[18:51:09] <raj> coldhead, I plan on using that code for multiple purposes
[18:51:14] <raj> but it's useful there too
[18:51:22] <raj> for when I show all the pictures a user has uploaded
[18:51:31] <raj> i just haven't created the "album" page yet
[18:51:38] <coldhead> okay raj
[18:52:00] <raj> can you suggest how I can mix that code with mine?
[18:52:33] <coldhead> raj: it looks like this guy has added his code as the "send:" param
[18:52:37] <coldhead> you have the add:
[18:52:46] <coldhead> i'm not familiar enough with blueimp
[18:52:52] <coldhead> maybe you can just drop it in
[18:52:57] <coldhead> maybe it replaces add:
[18:52:59] <coldhead> ?tias
[18:53:00] <bot-t> Try It And See
[18:53:20] <coldhead> you should be happy, there's some pretty decent looking code already written for your exact issue
[18:53:37] <raj> I was afraid to use it cuz I don't understand the code
[18:53:55] <raj> for example, what is .template-upload?
[18:54:05] <raj> like what is my corresponding element?
[18:54:31] <raj> oh, .fileupload maybe
[18:54:39] <raj> wait, no, they have #fileupload
[18:54:46] <raj> so i dunno what .template-upload is
[18:54:59] <coldhead> i would try commenting that line out
[18:55:02] <coldhead> and not worrying
[18:55:09] <coldhead> and if it fucks up, i would check the docs
[18:55:15] <coldhead> and like figure it out for myself
[18:55:42] <raj> comment out what line?
[18:55:51] <coldhead> the line you don't understand
[18:55:59] <raj> i don't nuderstand most of those lines
[18:56:00] <coldhead> which may not even be necessary
[18:56:02] <raj> like what is firstData
[18:56:11] <coldhead> you're asking the wrong people :D
[18:56:19] <Whirl3d> if you get a minute, could you give me some feedback on a real simple "timer" plugin I made...
[18:56:28] <coldhead> i am going for a walk
[18:56:30] <Whirl3d> not a big priority.
[18:56:58] <raj> and where in the code are additional input fields being added to the dom to do the hack being described?
[18:58:06] <batdorf> is there a way to query an object for an array of the class names it may have on a specific element (i.e. the class of the second nested div)?
[18:58:56] <Whirl3d> batdorf, first you have to select the elemen in question then use .prop("class") to get the classes it has
[19:01:44] <Whirl3d> var el=$(".someclass  *:nth-child(2)").prop("class").split(".") I think might work. Not sure if I got the syntax right. but that's the idea
[19:01:58] <batdorf> I think im just confused as to what I want to do
[19:03:27] <batdorf> m ryng to avoid hardcoding classes into this plug in im trying to make
[19:08:19] <batdorf> what if I want the first div in the object I passed?
[19:09:16] <batdorf> like $( elem div ).prop() ?
[19:09:44] <caleon> $.merge.apply(null, $("> div > div", mainSelector).map(function(i, el) { return el.classList; }))
[19:10:53] <batdorf> thanks
[19:10:58] <batdorf> ugly, but thanks :)
[19:12:12] <batdorf> if i just want to find out the classes, do I need to use merge?
[19:12:52] <caleon> i was thinking you wanted an array of class names instaed of the space-delimited strings
[19:13:01] <caleon> which is gettable on a dom element with .classList
[19:13:11] <caleon> but if you did that for each (sub) child you would get nested arrays
[19:13:18] <caleon> so merge just flattens them into one array
[19:13:33] <batdorf> I might be able to assume there is only one class applied
[19:13:35] <caleon> well, array-like object. you might want to $.makeArray(…) to make it an array
[19:13:44] <caleon> oh.
[19:14:12] <caleon> $('> div > div', mainSelector).map(function() { return this.classList }); might do
[19:14:16] <caleon> oops
[19:14:19] <caleon> not classList.
[19:16:03] <gnarf> elem.attr("class").split(/\s+/) ?
[19:16:07] <batdorf> if I have 1 div, and then another nested div, would i select the nested div like: $("self.$elem div:first-child").addClass
[19:16:29] <gnarf> elems.each( function() { console.log( this.className.split(/\s+/) ); });
[19:16:50] <pifantastic> batdorf: self.$elem.find("div:first-child");
[19:17:05] <gnarf> .children() if you only want first level decendants
[19:17:05] <batdorf> thanks
[19:17:08] <gnarf> ?children @batdorf
[19:17:08] <bot-t> batdorf, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[19:17:11] <gnarf> ?find @batdorf
[19:17:11] <bot-t> batdorf, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[19:17:30] <batdorf> ah
[19:19:25] <batdorf> still coming up undefined for some reason
[19:19:37] <caleon> what is undefined?
[19:19:40] <batdorf> console.log(self.$elem.children( "div:first-child" ).prop(".panel"));
[19:19:49] <caleon> i dont know what self is supposed to be, is that defined?
[19:20:00] <batdorf> this
[19:20:08] <caleon> and .prop('.panel') is looking for a property called '.panel'
[19:20:14] <batdorf> yes
[19:20:19] <caleon> versus a class?
[19:20:30] <batdorf> oh
[19:21:07] <batdorf> whats the syntax for a class?
[19:21:15] <batdorf> just "panel"?
[19:21:30] <batdorf> should i put the word class in there?
[19:21:43] <caleon> $elem.children('div:first-child').attr('class') would give you the class string of the first div inside $elem
[19:21:48] <caleon> attr or prop
[19:22:54] <raj> can I access the file data of any input file field, with .data() ?
[19:22:58] <batdorf> still undefined, let me make sure its not a simple error somewhere
[19:23:03] <raj> i mean, .data('data')
[19:23:50] <raj> ?.data()
[19:23:50] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[19:24:42] <batdorf> console.log(self.$elem); 			console.log(self.$elem.children( "div:first-child" ).attr("class"));
[19:24:56] <caleon> are you sure you want to do self.$elem
[19:25:10] <batdorf> I get the correct object, but undefined for the latter
[19:25:45] <gnarf> console.log( self.$elem.children()[0].tagName ) ?
[19:26:10] <gnarf> my thought: you are trying to get the "first div" not the "div that is a first child" because the div isn't a :first-child in your case
[19:26:10] <caleon> so there is, in your DOM, right within the $elem, a first div with a class attribute?
[19:26:57] <gnarf> if so. children( "div" ).eq( 0 ).attr( "class" )
[19:27:00] <batdorf> I get "P"
[19:27:07] <gnarf> batdorf: so the :first-child is a p
[19:27:09] <gnarf> not a div
[19:27:17] <gnarf> div:first-child wouldn't match it
[19:27:22] <gnarf> ?eq
[19:27:23] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[19:27:27] <caleon> first-of-type might
[19:27:38] <gnarf> why bother tho
[19:27:58] <gnarf> just find all of them and use .eq()
[19:28:22] <muhoo> is there a reliable way that i can execute a selection every time an ajax jquery ui tab is loaded? i.e. this: https://refheap.com/paste/2362
[19:28:27] <caleon> you're right
[19:28:56] <gnarf> muhoo: i think there is a load event in ui.tabs - but go check the docs.  see ?tabs
[19:28:57] <bot-t> muhoo, UI/API/1.8/Tabs - Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space, much like an accordion. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[19:29:02] <muhoo> thanks
[19:29:10] <muhoo> load event sounds perfect
[19:29:13] <batdorf> http://pastebin.com/LnRQE0PB
[19:29:47] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[19:30:24] <caleon> batdorf, in the end what is it that you want to query from that DOM structure?
[19:30:27] <coldhead> how rude
[19:30:50] <batdorf> .panel (or whatever the user happens to type in)
[19:31:07] <batdorf> i want to cache it
[19:31:30] <muhoo> i'm trying to keep my complaint quota down, but i have to say, damn is javascript SO annoying to have to deal with, after doing a lot of clojure for a while.
[19:31:48] <Antaranian> in jQuery scope, is there any hidden issue to use numbers as object keys ?
[19:32:00] <muhoo> oh  well
[19:32:02] <Antaranian> like $(function(){ var a = {}; a[25] = 'something'; });
[19:32:07] <caleon> batdorf, i'm not sure i understand: you want to get back each of the div's with the panel class name?
[19:32:15] <gnarf> batdorf: i gotta say, you're using words i know, but you aren't making sense :)
[19:32:26] <batdorf> ha ha
[19:32:30] <batdorf> ill type out what I want to do
[19:32:40] <gnarf> Antaranian: same "hidden issues" with using object keys on any other objects
[19:32:47] <batdorf> ive only been at this for about a month now
[19:33:02] <gnarf> Antaranian: it only gets a little strange if you also have a .length property - jQuery will treat it as "array like"
[19:33:26] <Antaranian> gnarf: ok, I just put it in jQuery context to ask here, because there wasn't a response in ##javascript :)
[19:33:27] <Bankzilla> .size for strings
[19:34:04] <sisb> Does anyone know why this setTimeout isn't executing? http://jsfiddle.net/hD6Td/6/
[19:34:52] <caleon> "this" within the function for setTimeout might be wrong
[19:35:20] <sisb> How else am I supposed to know which '.voter' I need it to run on?
[19:35:28] <gnarf> sisb: it definitely executes
[19:35:43] <caleon> either set a variable outside the function that the function has access to, or
[19:35:54] <caleon> $.proxy that function so as to set the "this" within that function
[19:35:54] <sisb> gnarf: I don't see the class being changed
[19:35:57] <batdorf> I want to take the width of each of the divs with a class of panel, then I want to count the number of panels (both of these I have done using return  $(".panel").length * $(".panel").width(); ). Instead though, I want to first select the div that is panel and cache the class in case panel is not the class (for example, if the user changed it, it won't effect the script so long as the structure was correct)
[19:36:10] <gnarf> sisb: that doesn't mean the function doesn't run
[19:36:10] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/hD6Td/8/
[19:36:20] <gnarf> sisb: your "this" is wrong inside that context this === window
[19:36:53] <sisb> I see
[19:37:08] <sisb> Thanks for the tip, it's been a while
[19:38:39] <caleon> batdorf: $('.coda-slider > div').attr('class') would get back "panel" which you can cache
[19:40:15] <caleon> if that resulting string was in a variable "panelClass", then you might do $(panelClass).length * $(panelClass).width()
[19:40:41] <rodd> Hello, I have a var containing the result of a jquery selector query, example var colors = $('.color'); - My question is, how can I get the last element from that list, like in an array, where I would call colors.pop(); ?
[19:40:57] <gnarf> batdorf: although it sounds to me like you really just need an option to your plugin called "panels"
[19:41:10] <gnarf> panels = ".panel" by default
[19:41:39] <caleon> $('.color:last-of-type') or $('.color').eq(-1)
[19:41:56] <caleon> probably better off with the .eq(-1), scratch the first
[19:42:03] <batdorf> no way to be more generic? witout .coda-slider?
[19:42:06] <rodd> caleon but i would like it to be removed from my var
[19:42:12] <rodd> just like pop does
[19:42:23] <gnarf> rodd so - do you still want it to be a jQuery when you're done?
[19:42:28] <gnarf> or do you want the DOMElement
[19:42:49] <rodd> i guess jquery isnt the right solution for this
[19:42:57] <gnarf> because the latter is easier... var colorElems = $('.color').get(), colorElems.pop();
[19:43:07] <gnarf> .get() returns the array
[19:43:13] <gnarf> you can then rewrap it with jQuery
[19:43:15] <rodd> hmm didnt know that
[19:43:23] <rodd> let me try
[19:43:29] <gnarf> so ... lastColor = jQuery( colorElems.pop() );
[19:43:37] <rodd> i was using .map
[19:43:38] <gnarf> totally works
[19:43:51] <gnarf> .get() returns the "raw array"
[19:44:23] <caleon> $('.color:not(:eq(-1))') ? never tried something like that though
[19:44:40] <gnarf> caleon: that is so gross... it probably won't work
[19:44:47] <caleon> heh
[19:44:52] <rodd> thanks for the tips
[19:44:57] <gnarf> rodd: your mileage may vary
[19:45:25] <caleon> oh there's slice.
[19:45:26] <rodd> .get worked just fine
[19:45:56] <gnarf> ?jsisjs
[19:45:56] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[19:45:57] <gnarf> ;)
[19:46:18] <rodd> touche
[19:46:22] <gnarf> you might actually be able to apply [].pop.call( selection );
[19:46:26] <gnarf> and have it work
[19:47:21] <gnarf> ?js var selection = jQuery([ "item1", "item2", "item3" ]), pop = [].pop; console.log( pop.call( selection ), selection.length, selection[1] );
[19:47:22] <bot-t> gnarf: "item3" 2 "item2"
[19:47:37] <gnarf> rodd: ^^^
[19:48:13] <gnarf> ?js var selection = jQuery([ "item1", "item2", "item3" ]), unshift = [].unshift; console.log( unshift.call( selection ), selection.length, selection[1] );
[19:48:14] <bot-t> gnarf: 3 3 "item2"
[19:48:20] <rodd> great
[19:48:23] <rodd> thanks gnarf
[19:48:38] <gnarf> rodd: although .get() is probably easier to read
[19:48:41] <gnarf> ;)
[19:48:51] <rodd> always learning something new :)
[19:48:58] <gnarf> unshift doesn't seem to want to work
[19:48:59] <rodd> sometimes i feel real dumb
[19:49:00] <gnarf> oh well
[19:49:15] <gnarf> it could just be bot-t
[19:49:45] <Zackington> ssdoin lads
[19:50:38] <coldhead> hej, Zackington
[20:00:54] <Zackington> toby get off tabs
[20:00:57] <Zackington> lawls
[20:02:12] <coldhead> get off... tabs
[20:12:20] <batdorf> is it possible to store it as ".panel" instead of "panel"? witout "." + panel?
[20:12:36] <Bankzilla> >> 3*3
[20:15:52] <gnarf> batdorf: what?
[20:17:02] <batdorf> $('.coda-slider > div').attr('class') = 'panel' but i need '.panel' to use it later on
[20:17:53] <gnarf> var selector = "." + $('.coda-slider > div').attr('class'); ?
[20:18:01] <gnarf> ?101 @batdorf
[20:18:02] <bot-t> batdorf, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[20:18:07] <gnarf> ?learn @batdorf
[20:18:07] <bot-t> batdorf, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[20:18:11] <Antaranian> batdorf: try  String.prototype.panelize = function(){ return '.' + this; }; :)
[20:18:29] <Antaranian> then $('.coda-slider > div').attr('class').panelize()
[20:18:44] <gnarf> Antaranian: don't be trollin - surely there is no need to modify the String prototype to do "." + str
[20:19:12] <gnarf> ;)
[20:19:21] <Antaranian> ok, sorry, just thought it looks really cool :)
[20:19:41] <imsky> panelize?
[20:19:49] <batdorf> gnarf: notice i wanted a way other than "." + panel
[20:20:12] <Bankzilla> im totally lost trying to follow batdorf lmao
[20:20:19] <gnarf> batdorf: um... Why?
[20:20:26] <gnarf> batdorf: isn't that easy enough?
[20:21:14] <batdorf> its fine, I just was hoping for a better looking way that I was unaware of.
[20:21:32] <gnarf> try checking out those links
[20:21:46] <gnarf> eloquent is probably the best book on awesome looking JS ever
[20:22:05] <gnarf> until rick writes one
[20:22:10] <gnarf> then that one will be better
[20:22:30] <batdorf> i read the eloquent aleady
[20:22:59] <gnarf> awesome
[20:23:31] <batdorf> ill read the others you mentioned
[20:23:52] <batdorf> thanks for the reommendations
[20:24:35] <batdorf> i was about to start: JavaScript: The Good Parts
[20:24:45] <coldhead> that's a very angry book
[20:24:50] <gnarf> it is
[20:24:52] <batdorf> do you reommend tis one?
[20:25:08] <gnarf> if you like to be angry about JavaScript, sure
[20:25:08] <coldhead> do whatever gnarf and bot-t say
[20:25:15] <gnarf> ?hug coldhead
[20:25:16] <bot-t> gnarf, Couldn't find "hug coldhead" in jQuery Docs.
[20:25:16] <batdorf> oh ok
[20:25:20] <coldhead> you should read the good parts sometime, but there's no rush
[20:25:23] <caleon> what does that mean, that it's angry (curious)
[20:25:35] <gnarf> blasphemy! how can that not be in the jQuery Docs!
[20:25:41] <coldhead> its written by a cranky old man
[20:25:51] <coldhead> who hates everything and thinks everything is stupid
[20:25:55] <caleon> haha, i see
[20:26:02] <gnarf> ?hug coldhead
[20:26:03] <bot-t> /me hugs coldhead! <3
[20:26:10] <gnarf> there
[20:26:22] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[20:26:22] * bot-t sighs
[20:26:32] <coldhead> i am sighing too, bb
[20:27:16] <batdorf> :)
[20:28:09] <gnarf> Anyone else?
[20:29:22] <batdorf> Thanks guys for the help. I need to refuel but I'll probably be around a lot more often (fair warning), so see you around.
[20:30:05] <Bankzilla> lol
[20:31:31] <gnarf> Bankzilla: crush any bank's today?
[20:31:40] <imsky> all right jquery experts
[20:31:46] <imsky> that includes you gnarf and coldhead
[20:32:26] * gnarf hides behind coldhead
[20:32:28] <imsky> how would you solve this here problem
[20:32:29] <imsky> http://jsfiddle.net/Z5WWU/
[20:32:50] <imsky> need to call foo with e and "hi" as parameters, what .call or .apply trickery do i do here
[20:33:24] <gnarf> imsky: forgive me
[20:33:29] <gnarf> imsky: what are e and t
[20:33:32] <coldhead> ha! gnarf has solved similar problems for me before
[20:33:34] <coldhead> i nominate him
[20:33:37] <Bankzilla> gnarf: not any banks but a few businesses
[20:33:40] <imsky> e is the event, t is any random parameter
[20:33:51] <imsky> i'm not 100% on jq internals, which is why this is hazy
[20:33:56] <gnarf> imsky: might i suggest "event" and "data" as parameter names
[20:34:04] <imsky> sure why not you sexy chap
[20:34:19] * coldhead faps
[20:34:19] <imsky> 99% of the jq examples out there use e, but event works just fine
[20:34:31] <gnarf> one letter variables are just confusing when you read it later
[20:34:33] <gnarf> is e element or event
[20:34:34] <caleon> i think you can pass additional parameters to .click() as data which the event handler has access to
[20:34:36] <imsky> coldhead, go solve my problem dammit
[20:35:09] <gnarf> imsky: so the parameter there is a little odd
[20:35:19] <imsky> which
[20:35:26] <gnarf> imsky: "data" - how is that supposed to be filled?
[20:35:49] <imsky> you tell me
[20:36:03] <imsky> e obviously gets passed along
[20:36:07] <Bankzilla> gnarf: e is for event
[20:36:15] <gnarf> imsky: as far as i know, the second param to event is only used when you use .trigger( "eventName", data )
[20:36:20] <imsky> but t...how to add it without an anonymous function?
[20:36:24] <gnarf> it will call eventNameHandler( event, data )
[20:36:25] <coldhead> we've moved past that, Bankzilla
[20:36:32] <Bankzilla> yeah im a bit slow haha
[20:36:40] <coldhead> no harm
[20:36:55] <caleon> or el.click({ myVar: 'hello }, function(e) { alert(e.data.myVar); })
[20:37:06] <imsky> gnarf, let's imagine that foo takes n parameters, in addition to the event
[20:37:11] <imsky> because who knows
[20:37:21] <imsky> so it's not tied to jq's event semantics
[20:37:39] <imsky> if .click can be substituted with .bind or .on, i'll take that too
[20:37:51] <gnarf> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/Z5WWU/1/
[20:38:01] <gnarf> imsky: closure?
[20:38:07] <imsky> ok closure hmm
[20:38:21] <imsky> finally a use for these things
[20:38:37] <gnarf> functions can return functions, and hold things in their scope
[20:39:31] <Bankzilla> didn't know that
[20:39:51] <imsky> ok gnarf so how do i access the parent scope from the closure there
[20:40:11] <imsky> that is, if makeFoo has n arguments, how can i get its arguments object from the closure
[20:40:22] * imsky digs around javascript zen garden feverishly
[20:40:29] <gnarf> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/Z5WWU/2/
[20:40:55] <imsky> righto, so outright explicit access is impossible
[20:41:02] <imsky> you have to do the whole variable thing
[20:41:19] <gnarf> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/Z5WWU/3/
[20:41:34] <gnarf> imsky: if you named them forever it would probably work
[20:41:44] <imsky> yep makes sense
[20:41:47] <gnarf> arguments is array enough that slice works on it
[20:42:03] <imsky> yes i know don't treat it as array, roger that 10-4 loud and clear
[20:42:04] <gnarf> so just copy the arguments at time of execution into a scoped var
[20:42:44] <imsky> gnarf, one last wrinkle. what if the arguments passed to makeFoo are themselves arbitrary
[20:43:01] <imsky> so e.g. .call converts arrays to argument lists
[20:43:12] <imsky> how would i do that with a list of words separated by spaces, split on spaces
[20:43:27] <gnarf> imsky: lost me there
[20:43:30] <Bankzilla> if you don't specify any params you can access the info with arguments?
[20:43:41] <coldhead> you can, Bankzilla
[20:43:42] <coldhead> ?tias
[20:43:43] <bot-t> Try It And See
[20:43:50] <gnarf> imsky: .apply( context, [ arg1, arg2 ]) === .call( context, arg1, arg2 )
[20:44:13] <imsky> so makeFoo.call(this, argArray.split(" ")) should work eh
[20:44:15] <imsky> let me give it a go
[20:44:51] <caleon> apply
[20:44:53] <gnarf> imsky: makeFoo.apply( this, argstring.split( " " ) ) ?
[20:45:00] <imsky> yep that's what i used
[20:45:03] <imsky> why did i say call
[20:45:04] <gnarf> imsky: apply takes the array
[20:45:11] <gnarf> ?mdn apply
[20:45:12] <bot-t> gnarf, .unload() - Bind an event handler to the "unload" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/unload/
[20:45:17] <gnarf> ?g mdn apply
[20:45:18] <bot-t> gnarf, apply - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[20:45:19] <imsky> gnarf that's what i used >:[
[20:45:24] <imsky> i MIS WROTE
[20:45:35] <gnarf> imsky: thats okay - never hurts to read a docs page
[20:45:36] <gnarf> :)
[20:45:41] <abjorn> BITCHES AIN'T SHIT
[20:45:43] <imsky> lol i know what it do
[20:45:43] <abjorn> sup
[20:45:48] <imsky> thanks gnarf you sexy manbeast
[20:45:54] <imsky> abjorn, solving prawblemz
[20:46:58] <imsky> my event handlers, let me reduce them to one liners awww yeeah
[20:47:08] <xp_prg> hi all I am extremely confused I defined a function in $(function() { like this function handleFailure(json) { stuff } }); yet when I try to invoke it in the chrome js console it says  ReferenceError: handleFailure is not defined
[20:47:37] <xp_prg> I see that my js file is included in the resources area
[20:47:37] <gnarf> xp_prg: thats because it's defined inside the document ready handler
[20:47:41] <caleon> $(…)(), no?
[20:47:47] <gnarf> xp_prg: not in "window" which is global
[20:47:48] <abjorn> oonce oonce oonce
[20:47:57] <imsky> listening to techno eh
[20:48:08] <gnarf> xp_prg: you need to put a breakpoint inside the code, then console can work on it
[20:48:11] <xp_prg> gnarf so I need to put it outside $(function() ?
[20:48:26] <xp_prg> if I want to reference it globally?
[20:48:46] <coldhead> do you REALLY want to reference it globally?
[20:48:53] <imsky> i want to reference you globally
[20:48:54] <gnarf> xp_prg: then make it a global... but beware, global pollution is serious business
[20:48:54] <xp_prg> yes it will handle failure globally
[20:48:56] <coldhead> can't you just do all your referencing inside the ready?
[20:49:06] <gnarf> window.handleFailure = handleFailure;
[20:49:21] <imsky> all my pick up lines will now be javascript related
[20:49:26] <imsky> hey baby wanna hoist my variables?
[20:49:52] <Bankzilla> what else you got
[20:49:52] <xp_prg> gnarf I have noticed you through these years, my feelings are not all platonic now that you have helped me with this, know this, and never question it
[20:49:58] <coldhead> no man could resist you, imsky
[20:50:07] <imsky> coldhead, no WOman
[20:50:10] <imsky> where are your manners
[20:50:20] <coldhead> i don't know about women, they're very complex
[20:50:26] <imsky> oh yeah?
[20:50:41] <coldhead> the only thing i know about women is that i know nothing about women
[20:50:46] <coldhead> a woman's love is like hate
[20:50:50] <gnarf> https://twitter.com/#!/jakeweary -- i wonder if this guy realizes people must think I'm talking about him all the time
[20:50:51] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from JakeWeary: I have a show next friday at the annual Kahoutek Music Festival at pitzer college in claremont ca. Got alot of new songs to share with you. ★ http://bit.ly/K9CzJJ

[20:56:45] <LukeNukem> :okay:
[20:56:59] <gnarf> LukeNukem: I've played with it a bit
[20:57:02] <imsky> bootstrap question avoided?
[20:57:09] * imsky uses bootstrap continuously
[20:57:17] <gnarf> LukeNukem: but I'm not in the habbit of answering questions about it... I don't kiss and tell
[20:57:23] <LukeNukem> imsky, gnarf any idea on how the modal plugin works?
[20:57:31] <imsky> LukeNukem, lol you serious?
[20:57:32] <LukeNukem> is it like Jquery UI?
[20:57:34] <gnarf> zero clue, sorry
[20:57:35] <imsky> there's the data-attribute
[20:57:38] <imsky> and then you're done
[20:57:41] <LukeNukem> kthx
[20:57:42] <imsky> it's brain dead easy
[20:58:11] <LukeNukem> data attribute

[20:58:27] <LukeNukem> yeah i got that
[20:58:50] <imsky> pshft i thought you had a real question
[20:59:13] <coldhead> did you try clicking on it, LukeNukem ?
[20:59:18] <coldhead> you have to click
[20:59:20] <imsky> lol bootstrap now has carousels and accordions
[20:59:27] <imsky> the 1 true toolkit

[21:03:21] <imsky> i gave up like halfway through
[21:03:41] <imsky> "I WORK HARDER THAN YOU I HAVE THE BEST PARENTS EVER CRUSH IT CRUSH IT INTERNET BUBBLE"
[21:04:18] <abjorn> wat
[21:04:31] <coldhead> ahahahhaha
[21:04:35] <coldhead> well summarised
[21:04:38] <abjorn> well im trying to not be lazy and read up on this grunt.js biznis
[21:05:02] <imsky> abjorn, http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2011/07/big-omaha-video-series-gary-vaynerchuk-of-vaynermedia
[21:05:22] <imsky> grunt js eh
[21:05:28] <DarthVader> \m/
[21:05:38] <imsky> anything ben alman writes
[21:05:44] <imsky> is worth considering
[21:05:47] <imsky> once
[21:05:58] <abjorn> well, I don't know of anything else filling that
[21:05:59] <abjorn> niche
[21:06:06] <imsky> lol yeah build automation
[21:06:11] <imsky> no tools out there
[21:06:14] <abjorn> well, specifically for js
[21:06:17] <imsky> is that make.exe i see
[21:06:19] <abjorn> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
[21:06:22] <imsky> nope
[21:06:24] <abjorn> you fucker
[21:06:26] <abjorn> ;(
[21:06:41] <imsky> reinventing the wheel so that you can type $ npm reinvented-wheel is lols worthy
[21:07:04] <DarthVader> "you fucker"
[21:07:08] <DarthVader> that reminded me of a porno
[21:07:09] <DarthVader> >_>
[21:07:12] <abjorn> o_o
[21:07:15] <imsky> O_O
[21:07:24] <abjorn> sir...you have some strange priorities
[21:07:36] <coldhead> i am horrified. horrified
[21:07:37] <LukeSkywalker> Father what are you talking about watching pornos?
[21:07:54] <DarthVader> LukeSkywalker, found them in your pc >_>
[21:08:15] <abjorn> I think this story ends there.
[21:08:26] * imsky reads grunt.js's readme and lols
[21:08:32] <abjorn> what's lols about it
[21:08:38] <imsky> right i remembered why i didn't care about it when it came out
[21:09:25] <coldhead> ben_alman is watching you
[21:09:39] <imsky> lol he can rest easy, i use hashchange
[21:09:41] <ajpiano> grunt is pretty incredible fwiw
[21:09:59] <imsky> ajpiano, the "init" functionality is useful
[21:10:16] <imsky> everything else is more or less part and parcel of your env
[21:10:30] <ajpiano> i'm not sure what you mean by that
[21:10:31] <abjorn> watch is nice but obviously nothing you couldn't cool up pretty quickly without it
[21:10:37] <abjorn> *cook
[21:11:04] <imsky> yeap godspeed grunt.js
[21:11:05] <ajpiano> mmk
[21:11:18] <gnarf> man watch
[21:11:23] <imsky> abjorn, gradle
[21:11:31] <abjorn> man gnarf
[21:11:39] <DarthVader> imsky, on the modal the close n stuff does not work
[21:11:43] <gnarf> NO MANUAL ENTRY!@?#
[21:11:45] <DarthVader> does it need additional plugins >_>
[21:11:47] <gnarf> LIES
[21:11:48] <imsky> DarthVader, the close should also have a data attr
[21:11:58] <DarthVader> imsky, set to?
[21:11:59] <abjorn> [root@cthulhu ~]# man gnarf
[21:11:59] <abjorn> No manual entry for gnarf
[21:12:08] <imsky> your box is called cthulhu?
[21:12:10] <abjorn> yes
[21:12:14] <imsky> u ly

[21:14:25] <imsky> my beast of burden
[21:14:28] <gnarf> git bash? windows FTL
[21:14:32] <imsky> psh
[21:14:36] <gnarf> although git bash is pretty sweet
[21:14:40] <abjorn> but videogames, gnarf
[21:14:43] <imsky> >90% market share ftl?
[21:14:48] <gnarf> abjorn: thats all i use my windows box for
[21:14:48] <abjorn> VIDEO
[21:14:49] <imsky> crackers be frontin
[21:14:49] <abjorn> GAMES
[21:14:51] <DarthVader> imsky, yeah its there i took the example code from their site
[21:15:04] <imsky> i ran win8 consumer preview couple days ago
[21:15:07] <abjorn> video games / wanting to be a lazy web surfer
[21:15:09] <imsky> DarthVader, then you're doing something wrong
[21:15:21] <imsky> gnarf, lol i have literally a shit ton of unix tools on here
[21:15:35] <abjorn> I have mingw but it's crapola
[21:15:40] <imsky> msys u nub
[21:15:41] <gnarf> imsky: they say 90% of market, but i sit at any table during a jQuery meeting and its 90% macs
[21:15:44] <imsky> mingw is just the compiler
[21:15:49] <imsky> gnarf, yeah
[21:15:49] <abjorn> whatever mofo
[21:15:54] <abjorn> they're all crapola
[21:16:00] <DarthVader> :FUCKTHISSHIT: im going to jquery UO
[21:16:01] <DarthVader> UI*
[21:16:09] <imsky> lol failing at bootstrap
[21:16:12] <abjorn> gnarf: that's because most web devs are hipsters
[21:16:38] <systemfault> Macs ftw
[21:16:41] <DarthVader> JUI = The stuff
[21:16:44] <imsky> gnarf, the only reason people can give for deving on a mac is: fonts and unix
[21:16:54] <imsky> i got that here with gdi+ and gnu tools
[21:16:56] <abjorn> jqui = good luck trying to do anything real with it
[21:16:58] <systemfault> And a real terminal...
[21:17:06] <imsky> systemfault, psh plz don't be ignant
[21:17:14] <imsky> "real terminal"
[21:17:20] <systemfault> powershell can suck it.. really.
[21:17:26] <abjorn> I gots me a real terminal on my linbutts install
[21:17:29] <gnarf> imsky: I used linux, then went to NeXT For a while, then to linux again, then to OS X
[21:17:41] <abjorn> who uses NeXT in the 2000's?
[21:17:43] <gnarf> imsky: and before that, prolly DOS and Win 3.1
[21:17:55] <imsky> gnarf, i like gnu tools, linux itself is just a hot mess to me
[21:17:57] <gnarf> abjorn: NeXT was ~95-'01
[21:18:01] <systemfault> abjorn: But the GUIs are bad on linux… also, photoshop doesn't work on it.
[21:18:01] <abjorn> ah
[21:18:02] <imsky> to server dudes it's the bees knees sure
[21:18:13] <imsky> but ubuntu is now strictly in VMs and recovery situations
[21:18:17] <abjorn> systemfault: I don't need to use photoshop so
[21:18:21] <abjorn> and no they aren't
[21:18:23] <imsky> systemfault, photoshop does work with it
[21:18:25] <abjorn> you're using the wrong window manager
[21:18:27] * imsky has tried
[21:18:27] <gnarf> systemfault: if i have to open photoshop, something is wrong :)
[21:18:36] <abjorn> xfce = sexy
[21:18:40] <imsky> lxde
[21:18:42] <abjorn> that too
[21:18:45] <imsky> xfce is for fat heffers
[21:18:45] <abjorn> and openbox
[21:18:46] <systemfault> gnarf: There's always smomething wrong… :/
[21:18:46] <techouse> gnome3 = sexyer
[21:18:49] <imsky> PSH
[21:18:50] <imsky> NOP
[21:18:51] <abjorn> ew
[21:18:51] <abjorn> go pls
[21:18:52] <abjorn> go pls
[21:18:53] <abjorn> go now
[21:18:59] <imsky> yes pls go to your fedora linbutts meeting
[21:19:07] <gnarf> so like the reason I like the Mac the most- because its the only one thats REALLY easy to run all the flavors of OS'es on :)
[21:19:07] <techouse> <3
[21:19:18] <imsky> techouse, do you like tech house?
[21:19:20] <abjorn> osx gui is shit anyways
[21:19:22] <abjorn> retarded setup
[21:19:25] <techouse> imsky: used to
[21:19:30] <techouse> i do trance mostly now
[21:19:30] <gnarf> abjorn: you use a mouse?
[21:19:35] <Bankzilla> I prefer coding on macs over than pcs
[21:19:38] <imsky> gnarf, yeah i see that argument as kinda valid, but only because apple is a piece of shit control freak. 6% market share = i don't care
[21:19:46] <abjorn> "Let's make everything counter-intuitive and different from everything anyone else does just so we can 'think different'"
[21:19:50] <imsky> techouse, right on, i'm not so big on trance but cool with tech house
[21:19:51] <techouse> Bankzilla: i prefer anything on unix > pc
[21:19:58] <gnarf> abjorn: hater :)
[21:20:00] * imsky has a mac anyway
[21:20:03] <techouse> eh, i mean windoze
[21:20:07] * systemfault has a mac too
[21:20:08] * imsky in the same way that mac dudes have winboxes
[21:20:11] <imsky> i use it for testing
[21:20:14] <techouse> i have a fedora
[21:20:17] <abjorn> gnarf: I won't deny. I am an Apple hater. Mostly because they make shitty hipster products
[21:20:21] <Bankzilla> Question: which text editors do you guys use. I Myself use Sublime 2
[21:20:26] <abjorn> sublime 2
[21:20:27] <imsky> Bankzilla, geany/gedit
[21:20:32] <imsky> OPEN SORES FOREVER
[21:20:35] <gnarf> abjorn: The only "Apple Product" i use is OS X
[21:20:43] <techouse> Bankzilla: sublime2 is cool, since it's free :D
[21:20:44] <abjorn> that's their worst one :(
[21:20:46] <systemfault> Bankzilla I'm a VIMer :P
[21:20:46] <techouse> and cross platform
[21:20:49] <gnarf> well , and the computer running it
[21:20:49] <techouse> free for now
[21:20:50] <DarthVader> DIABLO 3 IS COMING!!
[21:20:53] <imsky> lol no os x is cool
[21:20:55] <gnarf> and um, the ipod
[21:21:00] <abjorn> DarthVader: Play Path of Exile
[21:21:04] <Bankzilla> systemfault: I've converted a vimer to sublime ;)
[21:21:05] <imsky> display postscript and quartz...yeah os x is nice
[21:21:07] <gnarf> but android phone > iOS
[21:21:08] <gnarf> imo
[21:21:08] <DarthVader> meh
[21:21:13] <DarthVader> im not going to socialize anymore
[21:21:14] <abjorn> I started playing path of exile and immediately stopped caring about diablo 3
[21:21:17] <DarthVader> counter strike GO is coming
[21:21:22] <techouse> i'll make an iDroid
[21:21:24] <abjorn> >implying you have to socialize on PoE
[21:21:24] <gnarf> imsky: its actually display PDF anymore i think ;)
[21:21:31] <imsky> gnarf, say what
[21:21:34] <Bankzilla> DarthVader: Try Super Monday Night Combat (SMNC)
[21:21:59] <gnarf> imsky: i knew some guys who were on the CoreGraphics team
[21:22:07] <abjorn> PoE is free mmo diablo 2.5, and isn't actiblizzard
[21:22:08] <DarthVader> Bankzilla, works on Linux?
[21:22:09] <DarthVader> so whats the discussion? Macs vs windoes?
[21:22:09] <imsky> word up
[21:22:12] <imsky> nah
[21:22:20] <DarthVader> Facks vs Windhoes
[21:22:24] <imsky> gnarf got gag reflex when i mentioned git bash
[21:22:24] <DarthVader> what a lame battle
[21:22:25] <Bankzilla> DarthVader: Does anything work on Linux?
[21:22:25] <abjorn> I think we lost track of what the discussion is
[21:22:26] <gnarf> imsky: i remember someone talking about display postscript and how it was like capable of so much more
[21:22:29] <DarthVader> distro vs distro should be epic
[21:22:32] <systemfault> Bankzilla: I do
[21:22:35] <imsky> gnarf, turing complete and all
[21:22:35] <techouse> imsky: u need any artist suggestions for tech-house?
[21:22:38] <DarthVader> Bankzilla, Counter strike 1.6 LIKE A BOSS
[21:22:38] <gnarf> imsky: Fighting with it at the day job ;)
[21:22:39] <Bankzilla> anything not anyone ;)
[21:22:41] <imsky> techouse, what's your fave
[21:22:46] <systemfault> Bankzilla: I use Fedora 16 at work… they're too cheap to buy us macs.
[21:22:48] <imsky> gnarf, lol i bet
[21:22:49] <gnarf> imsky: but git bash is 100* better than tortoisegit
[21:22:50] <abjorn> DarthVader: distro vs distro comes down to practical vs ricer
[21:22:56] <imsky> gnarf, lol tortoisegit
[21:23:01] <Bankzilla> ewww tortoisegit
[21:23:09] <imsky> nah there actually IS a native bash.exe, but i'm just used to git's little thing
[21:23:13] <imsky> plus i can get msys any time
[21:23:15] <techouse> imsky: for tech-house? hmm
[21:23:26] <techouse> i'd say Mark Knight and the sort
[21:23:26] <imsky> in short: windows rules, everyone else drools
[21:23:29] <techouse> anything Toolroom
[21:23:36] <imsky> haven't heard either of these
[21:23:37] <systemfault> Windows is the worse of them all...
[21:23:39] <imsky> which decades are we talking
[21:23:43] <systemfault> And it's won't get any better..
[21:23:44] <Bankzilla> Windows is shocking to code on
[21:23:51] <gnarf> damn, what did I start!@?
[21:23:55] <Bankzilla> plus they keep pushing IE until it gets big again
[21:23:58] <imsky> systemfault, possibly, who knows
[21:24:05] <systemfault> gnarf: You created a monster… :/
[21:24:05] <imsky> i go where the customer is
[21:24:13] <abjorn> windows is shockingly to code C++ in, just sayin'
[21:24:17] <abjorn> shockingly?
[21:24:20] <abjorn> awesome is what i meant
[21:24:21] <imsky> shockingly lol
[21:24:23] <abjorn> it's shockingly awesome
[21:24:27] <imsky> yeah i love windows api jesus
[21:24:29] <systemfault> Hmm… What?
[21:24:32] <abjorn> not that
[21:24:34] <abjorn> visual c++
[21:24:35] <abjorn> fuck yeah
[21:24:37] <systemfault> Visual C++ rocks.
[21:24:39] <systemfault> Yes.
[21:24:39] <Bankzilla> 0,0
[21:24:46] <abjorn> best ide is best
[21:24:54] * imsky doesn't like ides
[21:24:59] <imsky> my branes
[21:25:01] <systemfault> I agree… and its debugger is the best on the planet :)
[21:25:02] <Bankzilla> its so sluggish
[21:25:04] <abjorn> You will if you code C++
[21:25:04] <imsky> it hurts my branes
[21:25:15] <techouse> haskell > *
[21:25:19] <imsky> lol nooo
[21:25:20] <abjorn> IDE+Debugger is the only sane way to code C++
[21:25:28] <imsky> haskell < so many other languages
[21:25:44] <systemfault> techouse: Haskell is very good…. but since nobody uses it...
[21:25:45] <techouse> joking :D
[21:25:48] <abjorn> sometimes I think haskell is confusing for the sake of being confusing
[21:25:49] <techouse> yea
[21:25:51] <techouse> true
[21:25:56] <hyperstream> just rocked up: Organic Fruit n Veg $36 to the door, 9-10kg's - NOM NOM
[21:26:07] <Bankzilla> da heck?
[21:26:16] <imsky> there's actually no reason for haskell/ocaml to look the way they do
[21:26:19] <techouse> in terms of omnipotency and omnivalence python is probably the way to cornhole your pc
[21:26:24] <imsky> you can rewrite both languages to look C-like
[21:26:31] <abjorn> "the way to cornhole your pc" all of my what
[21:26:44] <techouse> lol
[21:26:47] <abjorn> what the FUCK are you saying
[21:26:49] <imsky> but the kewel doods who put in lazy evaluation and type systems in there were like "FUCK IT LETS GO ALL THE WAY"
[21:26:50] <abjorn> I don't even
[21:26:59] <systemfault> imsky is a joke :/
[21:27:05] <imsky> systemfault, what is
[21:27:08] <abjorn> imsky is no joke
[21:27:09] <abjorn> he's
[21:27:10] <abjorn> a wiggla
[21:27:13] * abjorn wiggles
[21:27:13] * imsky wiggles
[21:27:23] <techouse> helloooo
[21:27:27] <techouse> i am lindsay lohan
[21:27:30] <techouse> xD
[21:27:32] <imsky> systemfault, you saying i'm a joke, foo?
[21:27:36] <gnarf> I guess since I started it, I should be the one to stop it
[21:27:39] <ajpiano> ?offtopic all this stuff
[21:27:39] <bot-t> While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of all this stuff is off-topic for this channel, so let's please move on.
[21:27:41] <abjorn> techhouse you are all kinds of high
[21:27:47] <gnarf> ooo ajpiano, thanks
[21:27:55] <techouse> 6:20 + working all night = very high
[21:28:04] <techouse> + tiësto in the ears
[21:28:08] <imsky> yeah probably time to go sleep
[21:28:13] <techouse> yep
[21:28:15] <abjorn> WELL no ones asking any jquery questions so psh

[21:28:22] <techouse> but sun is trolling me in the face
[21:28:33] <techouse> Bankzilla: me too
[21:28:34] <imsky> abjorn, yeeeaaa boyyy
[21:28:38] <ajpiano> yeah but at a certain point.....
[21:28:40] <abjorn> whatevs
[21:28:41] <imsky> abjorn, i got into express the other day

[21:30:48] <techouse> night
[21:31:53] <imsky> niight
[21:40:57] <r3za> hi , i wrote this code : http://pastebin.com/C1MJiULG and i got this error : Timestamp: 4/26/2012 9:10:17 AM , Error: missing : after property id
[21:42:16] <r3za> can anyone help me please
[21:42:49] <Cork> r3za: whats in data_array['xAxis_categories']
[21:44:05] <r3za> Cork : data_array['xAxis_categories'] = ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12'];
[21:44:09] <Cork> uh and $.inArray("xAxis_categories",data_array) doens't make any sence
[21:44:37] <Cork> at least not in the context of data_array['xAxis_categories']
[21:45:17] <Cork> r3za: is data_array an array or an object?
[21:45:21] <r3za> Cork : im looking for one argument in data_array , so what should i do ?
[21:45:27] <r3za> r3za: array
[21:45:56] <Cork> so its data_array = [1,2,3,4,5,'xAxis_categories'] ?
[21:46:23] <jrockjiggz> if( data_array['xAxis_categories'] != undefined ?
[21:46:30] <Cork> not data_object = { 'xAxis_categoreis': ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12']
[21:46:33] <Cork> }
[21:46:52] <jrockjiggz> or  data_array.hasOwnProperty("key")
[21:47:09] <Cork> jrockjiggz: lets find out if its an array or an object first >_<
[21:47:15] <jrockjiggz> =/
[21:49:25] <r3za> Cork : error again : Timestamp: 4/26/2012 9:18:43 AM
[21:49:25] <r3za> Error: missing : after property id  - Source Code:               if (data_array.hasOwnProperty("xAxis_categories"),data_array) {
[21:49:48] <Cork> r3za: please answer the question about whats in the variable
[21:50:01] <Cork> is it key:value pairs => an object
[21:50:01] <r3za> Cork : wait
[21:50:07] <Cork> or a list of values => an array
[21:50:16] <grantg> hey Cork
[21:50:21] <Cork> o/
[21:50:26] <imsky> \o/
[21:50:30] <grantg> hey imsky
[21:50:34] <imsky> lol hey
[21:50:56] <grantg> I'm deciding if I should merge the LLE-APU branch yet to master for gameboy-online (AKA js gbc)
[21:51:14] <grantg> The new branch generates audio samples at 4 MHZ
[21:51:26] <grantg> rather than 262144 HZ
[21:51:59] <grantg> and more accurate (hence LLE)
[21:52:20] <r3za> Cork : http://pastebin.com/qBVJuD14
[21:52:23] <grantg> it emulates the APU hardware counters on a real gb
[21:52:36] <grantg> including duty cycle clocks
[21:52:46] <grantg> rather than HLE'ing the whole process
[21:52:46] <Cork> r3za: ok, thats an object, not an array
[21:53:07] <grantg> Cork: http://gamecenter.grantgalitz.org/gameboy/ is where the branch is at
[21:53:17] <grantg> Chrome and firefox both run it at fullspeed
[21:53:25] <Cork> r3za: and line 9 is completly unneeded
[21:53:30] <r3za> Cork: so how should looking for it ?
[21:53:32] <grantg> Which means chrome and firefox can run JS at around 100 MIPS here
[21:54:05] <r3za> Cork : oh right old code converted to jquery
[21:54:34] <Cork> r3za: doens't really matter, this is just javascript basic types
[21:55:01] <Cork> r3za: your doing this in a loop or something, or is it static like in the pb?
[21:56:15] <r3za> Cork : what the hell is pb ? u know what i was looking for a smart way but now how about i use a loop to find it ?
[21:56:26] <Cork> PasteBin
[21:56:59] <Cork> r3za: i'm trying to find how your code should best be structured
[21:57:30] <r3za> Cork : thanks buddy
[21:57:35] <grantg> Cork: DDR works now. :)
[21:57:50] <r3za> Cork : ok so pleasee talk more simple , because im not good at english
[21:57:55] <Cork> r3za: so; is it static like in the pb or do you loop or something like that?
[21:57:59] <grantg> Due to better hardware bug emulation
[21:58:03] <Bankzilla> what low life ddos's pastie :(
[21:58:31] <Cork> r3za: that is how much of that data is generated, and what part is just static
[22:02:47] <Cork> uh... ook
[22:03:26] * Cork hates php for creating hast/objects with Array it makes so many ppl confused >_<
[22:03:34] <Cork> hast==hash
[22:12:26] <Abbas-> guys, if you see the two blocks of code http://i.imgur.com/5dOig.jpg please
[22:12:40] <Abbas-> if i remove teh top block (circled red) the 2nd block works fine,
[22:13:01] <Abbas-> but if the circled code stays, the 2nd block doesnt work, how to i 'noConflict' two blocks of code?
[22:13:12] <Cork> ?p @ Abbas-
[22:13:13] <bot-t> Abbas-, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:13:31] <Cork> Abbas-: show code in text not in screenshots
[22:14:02] <Abbas-> Cork there is a lot of other dependent code in multiple files. my only issue is, i don't know how to make 'noConflict' work for two blocks of code
[22:14:14] <Abbas-> let me paste this
[22:14:14] <ManxPower> Has anyone heard of IE caching the data received from an AJAX call?  The call is run multiple times with the same URL, the script returns different data for each call.  It works in Chrome, doesn't in IE, the call is run, but the data is the same as the first time it was called.
[22:14:49] <Cork> ManxPower: you doig a get or what?
[22:14:59] <Cork> "ajax" is too generic
[22:15:10] <beancurd> ManxPower: is the data actually getting called a second time in IE? maybe it's not even firing the second time.
[22:16:03] <Cork> ManxPower: post connections is never cached, get connections can be
[22:16:52] <ManxPower> beancurd: I'm using console.log in the ajax success handler to see that it is being called again and what the data returned is.
[22:17:10] <ManxPower> Cork: I'll change to a post and see what happens
[22:18:37] <ManxPower> AHA!  using POST fixed the issue.  Thanks cork!
[22:18:58] <Cork> ManxPower: your using $.ajax?
[22:22:00] <Abbas-> Cork , took me a while to put the files together > http://jsfiddle.net/Ezet2/1/
[22:22:15] <Abbas-> please remove the 'first block' in Javascirpt and run and u can see sldier running on right
[22:22:21] <Abbas-> but if first block is tehre, then 2nd block doesn't work
[22:23:02] <Cork> Abbas-: your running jQuery.noConflict() twice?
[22:24:00] <Cork> Abbas-: jQuery.noConflict() only need to be run once after you've loaded jquery
[22:24:08] <Cork> its not to supbsitute $ for jQuery
[22:24:13] <Cork> its to release the use of $
[22:24:27] <Cork> *substitute
[22:26:36] <ManxPower> Cort: Yes, $.ajax()
[22:26:41] <Abbas-> hmm
[22:26:57] <Cork> ManxPower: set cache: false, and you should be able to use get too
[22:27:13] <ManxPower> Cork: thanks.
[22:27:28] <Cork> np
[22:27:32] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[22:27:38] <Abbas-> Cork , how do i make the 2nd block work without removing the first block? i need both of those blocks tehre for the 2 different sliders
[22:28:03] <Abbas-> spent 4 hours figuring this slider out and now it refuses to work with the other slider (1st block)
[22:28:15] <ruby_on_tails> i have a code where a dom element is frequently removed and fetched again, i use .remove() and then .append() to append the new element, but the problem is as per the chrome profiler the memory keeps on rising
[22:28:19] <ruby_on_tails> what should i do ?
[22:28:20] <Cork> Abbas-: the noConflict comments i've given you
[22:29:08] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: make sure you don't have any variable pointing to the old removed element
[22:29:16] <Cork> if you do have one make sure to null it
[22:29:31] <Cork> else the old element will be cept indefenitly
[22:29:36] <Cork> *kept
[22:30:10] <addisonj> running into a weird thing with jQuery 1.7.2, using serializeArray to serialize a form, I have values set, but it comes back, all the keys have empty strings as their values. I have checked everything I can think of, HTML is valid, no elements are disabled, but I still get all the values as empty
[22:32:59] <Abbas-> Cork i dont really understand javasc in depth but fixed it :p
[22:33:06] <Abbas-> just had to move teh 2nd block to top
[22:33:25] <Cork> Abbas-: to recap, your calling noConflict twice
[22:33:27] <Cork> you shouldn't
[22:33:40] <Abbas-> yes Cork understood but even then
[22:33:45] <Abbas-> the 2nd block wasnt working under 1st block
[22:33:53] <Abbas-> had to move it above teh 1st block and now it works
[22:34:05] <Abbas-> why is that so?
[22:34:29] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: its a long js, how can i see if a variable points towards it ?
[22:36:25] <ruby_on_tails> the thing doesnt really effect chrome, but on FF it slowly becomes slow and slow and starts to drag
[22:40:54] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: why do many games have a frame rate flickering on the screen ?
[22:42:19] <coldhead> .seen aaronmcadam
[22:42:25] <coldhead> >: |
[22:49:20] <ruby_on_tails> nvm
[22:54:50] <Cork> Abbas-: your sure easyAccordion is noConflict safe?
[22:59:50] <minna> Is it possible to prevent a javascript from loading?
[23:01:04] <Abbas-> Cork , it seems to work now without breaking the other slider :o
[23:01:06] <Abbas-> so i hope it is ;p
[23:01:22] <Cork> minna: not from content no
[23:01:25] <pifantastic> ?xy @ minna
[23:01:25] <bot-t> minna, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[23:02:51] <minna> Is it possible to prevent a CMS injected javascript from loading? My script can load before the CMS have injected it to the page.
[23:02:53] <mgl> Do you know that after update firefox to v12 , jqGrid has error "jqGrid is not a function"?
[23:04:17] <pifantastic> minna: what is injecting it?
[23:04:28] <pifantastic> minna: and what CMS?
[23:04:50] <pifantastic> minna: and if you have access to the code, why don't you just disabled the code from injecting in the first place?
[23:06:11] <minna> The CMS module is injecting it weither i want to or not.
[23:07:02] <minna> It's some commercial CMS, so i don't have access to source, if i had, i wouldnt be asking this question :)
[23:08:12] <pifantastic> minna: why is the injected code causing you trouble?
[23:08:28] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, cms module
[23:11:04] <tw2113> yo coldhead
[23:15:57] <coldhead> hej tw2113
[23:17:47] <minna> pifantastic: It's loading a 110kb script file that i dont need...
[23:18:14] <minna> coldhead: Hey! you'r the wisest of them all, you should know if this is possible?
[23:18:20] <pifantastic> minna: how is it being injected?
[23:18:32] <minna> In source.
[23:18:55] <pifantastic> minna: in that case you're out of luck
[23:18:57] <coldhead> minna: i don't know a goddamn thing
[23:19:08] <coldhead> minna: i would try setting the base href= to something wrong
[23:19:13] <pifantastic> lol
[23:19:17] <coldhead> which would merely break everything else
[23:19:18] <minna> coldhead: aah, that must explain why your here all the time :)
[23:19:20] <pifantastic> that would work actually
[23:19:35] <coldhead> bye, images
[23:19:37] <minna> base href?
[23:19:40] <eshlox> hi, i use http://www.briangrinstead.com/files/bindWithDelay/ i want run my function with this, when i write $('input[name=tags]').bindWithDelay("keyup", search(), 1000); then firebug show me fn.apply is not a function, why? where is problem?
[23:20:01] <coldhead> http://reference.sitepoint.com/html/base
[23:20:28] <coldhead> eshlox: i think you might want search, instead of search()
[23:20:50] <coldhead> unless search() returns a function
[23:20:57] <coldhead> i bet it doesn't
[23:21:10] * Cork bets coldhead wins that bet
[23:21:50] <coldhead> no metabets!
[23:21:58] <eshlox> coldhead: ok, now it works, thanks ;->
[23:22:02] <coldhead> that's what caused the global financial crisis
[23:22:06] <coldhead> good work, eshlox
[23:22:12] <Cork> lol
[23:22:17] <coldhead> why don't you treat yourself to some chocolate
[23:31:51] <minna> coldhead: Um, how would i use base for this? It's for setting the base url for all links on the page?
[23:32:34] <coldhead> yes minna
[23:32:44] <coldhead> i was thinking you could set it to something stupid
[23:32:50] <coldhead> just so the script wouldn't load
[23:32:58] <coldhead> then set it back to something sensible
[23:33:10] <coldhead> it's probably not really feasible
[23:33:20] <minna> Hm, but the base tag is only valid in the had right?
[23:33:25] <minna> head*
[23:33:47] <coldhead> it probably works elsewhere
[23:33:50] <coldhead> i'm not sure
[23:33:55] <coldhead> no one really uses it
[23:35:28] <minna> coldhead: So i noticed, i could try and wrap the source in it, but that would render the images urls wrong too, i guess i'll just have to let it go.
[23:36:09] <magcius> https://gist.github.com/627f7fde06129cdc18b2 -- is there a way to do this better?
[23:36:23] <coldhead> minna: you COULD poll furiously for a script with the forbidden href and remove() it the moment you found it
[23:36:33] <coldhead> sorry, forbidden src*
[23:36:48] <coldhead> if it's 110k you might even remove it before it finished loading
[23:39:58] <minna> polling like that would probably make IE go berserk
[23:43:24] <coldhead> you have a terrible problem, minna
[23:43:34] <coldhead> i feel awful for you
[23:45:13] <minna> Thanks
[23:45:30] <minna> Be careful so you dont get sick
[23:45:39] <minna> feeling that awful
[23:45:44] <pifantastic> minna: just DDOS the server that script is hosted on
[23:45:49] <pifantastic> PROBLEM SOLVED
[23:46:04] <minna> pifantastic: finally a proper answer! Thanks, will get right on it!
[23:46:22] <coldhead> hahahahha
[23:46:29] <minna> Just one problem, it's on the same server...
[23:46:44] <coldhead> so this solves multiple problems for you!
[23:46:55] <coldhead> all your other problems will be irrelevant!
[23:47:00] <coldhead> good work pifantastic
[23:47:01] <minna> True dat
[23:47:09] <minna> Yeah, thanks pifantastic
[23:47:14] <pifantastic> np
[23:47:17] <pifantastic> I'm here to serve
[23:47:18] <minna> Could not have done it without you
[23:47:35] <minna> here to serve all your base
[23:47:40] <pifantastic> I'm screeshotting this convo for my rèsumw
[23:47:50] <pifantastic> also rèsumè
[23:47:55] <minna> :)
[23:48:07] <echofish> obj is null at line 46. Anyone see why? http://phpgolf.org/infoscreen_server/
[23:48:37] <pifantastic> ?getJSON @ echofish
[23:48:38] <bot-t> echofish, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[23:48:49] <pifantastic> whoops
[23:49:05] <pifantastic> you are using that
[23:49:07] <pifantastic> let me see...
[23:50:42] <pifantastic> ah, echofish you don't need to parseJSON
[23:50:48] <pifantastic> jquery does that for you when you call getJSON
[23:50:57] <pifantastic> remove that line
[23:51:08] <pifantastic> data is already the object, JSON decoded
[23:51:31] <echofish> oh
[23:52:10] <echofish> thanks :)
[23:52:12] <pifantastic> npnp
