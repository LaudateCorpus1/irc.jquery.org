[11:23:36] <chazy> hi, if i have an object with html (a server response object from an ajax request), how do i check if a certain element exists?
[11:23:59] <chazy> like jQuery( data ).find( '#my-element' ) ?
[11:55:57] <robertmaxrees> chazy depending, yep.
[13:11:49] <auxin> I have a novice issue with a page that has a single div to encapsulate content. It isn't position in the center completely and I'm not certain what gives it a noticable border around it, at present, but the page seems to be slightly wider than the viewable region and causes a lateral scroll bar to be present. What can I examine or learn to understand how to configure this to my liking?
[13:12:17] <robertmaxrees> css
[13:12:23] <auxin> It's almost all css
[13:12:26] <auxin> and js
[13:12:46] <robertmaxrees> css is what defines layout, even if you use js to set it.
[13:13:04] <robertmaxrees> i would join #css and see if they can't help you more :)
[13:13:11] <auxin> ok, thank you.
[15:39:41] <Guest49090> Hello?
[15:40:27] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
