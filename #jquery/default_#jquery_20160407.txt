[01:39:39] <thomedy> you know whats weird...
[01:39:52] <thomedy> you know when you roll a mobile browsers url bar up
[01:39:58] <thomedy> it kills my click event
[02:51:11] <sliterok> I'm here again now!
[02:51:19] <sliterok> Any ideas why jquery isn't loading?
[02:51:37] <sliterok> $ in console outputs undefined
[02:51:54] <sliterok> Even if link to jquery.js is valid
[03:10:01] <ussher_> color picker on psudo elements.  I have a color picker working for things like $()
[03:10:18] <sliterok> Ahem.
[03:11:06] <sliterok> http://pastebin.com/N9ERiJ37
[03:11:10] <ussher_> oops $(".breadcumbs a")  but is there a way to get it to work on $(".breadcumbs a:hover")  seeing "no way" answers on stackoverflow from 5 years ago.  wondering if theres been a way since then
[03:11:25] <sliterok> If i get alert, with code above, does it means i have jquery setted up correctly?
[03:12:18] <sliterok> Ahh. wrong code, lol
[03:13:07] <robhol> ussher_: the way is the same as it's always been. attach an event for hover
[03:14:21] <ussher_> Seams like what im doing is adding extra style to the element that exists in the dom, am i thinking about it wrong to want to change the CSS file and have it reload?
[03:14:44] <robhol> yes, very.
[03:15:05] <ussher_> bugger, seamed simple that way.  thanks robhol
[03:15:06] <robhol> you can add a class in the CSS and add/remove that class dynamically to the object
[03:15:15] <robhol> which is a billion times simpler, trust me ;)
[03:15:46] <ussher_> im building a style editor, so its needs to respect the classes that exist and allow them to be altered.  so that wont work in this case.
[03:16:04] <ussher_> I'll go research the event adding idea.  thanks.
[03:16:10] <robhol> then there's always .css()
[03:17:39] <ussher_> thats the issue, $(".breadcrumbs a:hover")).css({"background-color":"#ff0000"}) doesnt change it in this case.
[03:18:02] <ussher_> without the :hover it does exactly what im after.
[03:19:07] <robhol> because as I said, you need an event handler for the hover part of it.
[03:19:18] <ussher_> understood.
[03:20:44] <Uhkis> why isn't that just in your basic css?
[03:21:46] <ussher_> that IS in the basic CSS and I'm wanting to use a colorpicker to change its color live.  like how firebug's firepicker works.
[03:29:59] <sliterok> Ahh.
[03:30:03] <sliterok> May someone here help me?
[03:30:40] <sliterok> In this code, i get both alerts http://pastebin.com/jPDYpw4C
[03:32:43] <ussher_> sliterok: they both look like they should be firing the alert.  one reads "this will fail" but if jquery is there it seams like it should work.
[03:33:31] <sliterok> Im not sure, but my $ script is still throwing Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function
[03:34:09] <ussher_> you have a link to  jquery included in the file somewhere?  you'll get that error if jquery is not loaded.
[03:34:48] <sliterok> Jquery is loaded, because if i replace every $ in script by JQuery, code starts working.
[03:35:14] <ussher_> for me i get both alerts too.
[03:38:55] <sliterok> Any ideas how to fix? I want to use $ instead of JQuery
[03:51:25] <sliterok> Okay. I think, that something in code of cms redefines $
[03:51:31] <sliterok> How i can forbid to redefine it?
[04:18:09] <sliterok> Can someone google for me?
[04:18:36] <sliterok> How do i post object from jquery code into mysql?
[04:26:17] <sliterok> Noone will google for me? :c
[04:40:32] <Kartagis> sliterok: can't you google?
[04:40:56] <sliterok> Kartagis: im sorta getting other things.
[04:41:41] <Kartagis> can't those "other things" include googling? I don't think anyone will google for you
[04:42:10] <sliterok> Sad4me
[04:50:05] <robhol> wtf
[04:50:21] <robhol> why in the ever-holy fuck would you allow client code direct database access?!?
[04:53:33] <Miles8of9> Oo
[05:00:09] <suexec> I'm using jQuery Mobile on a page I am making. I have a custom function that loads pages via $.ajax , fades out my main div, replaces content, then fades it in. This is working. If I create i.e a <ul> with the listview widget set (data-role="listview") on the page that I load, can I expect this to be treated by the existing javascript? (I am loading it, but its not working. Is my logic or code flawed?)
[05:00:18] <momomo> how do I scroll an element to a certain position ... i want to set the scroll not animate
[05:00:31] <momomo> App.E.main.animate({scrollTop: position[0], scrollLeft:position[1]}); works .. but its not instant
[05:00:44] <momomo> App.E.main.scrollTo doesnt seem to exist for main
[05:00:53] <momomo> App.E.main.get(0).scrollTop = 300; is not working either
[06:17:01] <hirsty> hey all - working with the jQ validate plugin - how could i validate a selected file (file is NOT required - but if it is selected - i want it validating)
[06:38:56] <konrados> Hello.
[06:41:56] <konrados> "checking" a checkbox manually like this: "$('.myCheckbox').prop('readonly',false)" doesn't trigger the "change" event what surprised me a bit - is this normal, or there is a bug somewhere in my code? And a second question - if this is normal, what can I do to change it, so the trigger will be fired? Is manually firing the event the only option?
[06:42:14] <konrados> *"unchecking" a checkbox...
[06:44:20] <hirsty> wouldnt u use click event and :checked?
[06:44:30] <hirsty> *i think
[06:48:04] <decx> change is a specific thing involving focusing a field, inputting stuff and then blurring it
[06:51:52] <konrados> thanks decx. @hirsty - yeah, it works, which surprise me either :) I expected the at the time event is triggered the trigger code will receive the information too soon, because when checkbox is unchecked we do 'click' and the function sees it unchecked, and then we check it. But somehow it works.
[06:52:32] <hirsty> gotta click a mouse before it changes ;)
[07:30:49] <akkonrad> I have bind event to inpt field. it works when typing, pasting and clicking with mouse in next field, but it does not work when hitting "Tab" key and moving to next field: $('#email').bind('keyup, focusout, blur', function ...)
[07:35:40] <surianup> Hello guys
[07:38:53] <surianup> I am trying to make a progress bar while submitting the form via ajax I have using the code but it is taking the setTimeout() not actual time takes vai server
[07:38:56] <surianup> https://jsfiddle.net/t0g8qsud/
[07:39:03] <surianup> can anyone help me pleae
[07:39:06] <surianup> please ?
[07:40:00] <surianup> I need to show the time taking via browser between client and server
[07:40:18] <surianup> how to show this can anyone let me know please >?
[07:54:39] <szt> hey, I have an add bug with jquery. .done() executes for a GET .ajax but when I do a PUT .ajax it does not execute what so ever...
[08:25:11] <Serg_Penguin_> how can i insert into the middle of jquery collection by given numeric index ?
[08:28:25] <decx> there's no splice
[08:28:31] <decx> you have to add and sort
[08:29:40] <shoky> or .get() and splice and $()  ;p
[08:30:05] <decx> one of those
[08:30:57] <shoky> tho probably he's actually looking for .eq().insertAfter()  or something
[08:31:07] <shoky> er .eq().after()  i mean
[08:31:17] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/unfdzshL/
[08:32:06] <decx> well after wouldnt add to a collection tho
[08:32:22] <shoky> sort function return val isn't boolean
[08:32:50] <decx> what's -1 0 1 called then
[08:32:52] <Serg_Penguin_> i try to do binary search-and-insert
[08:33:21] <Serg_Penguin_> to add items from async AJAX responses into the right place, in sorted order
[08:33:44] <Serg_Penguin_> add and sort has abysmal performance ;(
[08:33:48] <shoky> decx i donno,  compare-value or smth
[08:33:57] <shoky> but you're not returning -1 0 1
[08:34:32] <decx> gonna guess equal counts as less
[08:34:41] <shoky> Serg_Penguin_  .get() will get you the underlying array,  then you can do whatever you want with it, including .splice() to insert something in a specific index
[08:34:56] <Serg_Penguin_> as last resort, i may wait for everyone to load (counter?) and then sort
[08:35:10] <shoky> decx was that to me
[08:35:18] <shoky> (coz donno what you mean)
[08:35:19] <decx> more for myself
[08:35:32] <decx> well -1 is less than 0 is equal and 1 is higher
[08:36:01] <shoky> -1  means a is bigger,  1 means b is bigger
[08:36:07] <shoky> but yea
[08:36:23] <shoky> might've said it backwards
[08:36:47] <shoky> anyways you can do  return str1.localeCompare(str2);
[08:36:51] <decx> oh right only a-b was valid as a boolish return
[08:37:05] <shoky> boolish :D that works
[08:37:09] <decx> hehe
[08:42:35] <Serg_Penguin_> oops... i get $('ul#my_dynamic_list').children() , how to add first synthetic child to it ?
[08:42:44] <Serg_Penguin_> it's empty of coz
[08:43:19] <decx> as synth child? elder maxson just got triggered
[08:43:32] <shoky> oo i want one
[08:44:07] <decx> you just prepend to the ul Serg_Penguin_
[08:47:08] <YamakasY> what is the best javascript tracer in FF ? still fireebug or are there more "simple" onces to do simple traces
[08:47:52] <hirsty> #FirebugForLife
[08:48:27] <Serg_Penguin_> yeah, I made a round lap: $ul.append($li) was my initial no-sort, dummy implementation
[08:51:09] <YamakasY> hirsty: okay, but how to tracroute simple calls'I don't see noen atm :S
[08:51:41] <hirsty> u got a fiddle or smthin?
[08:51:57] <YamakasY> hirsty: nope, just debugging working code on a non-working page
[08:52:07] <hirsty> linky?
[08:52:12] <YamakasY> nope local
[08:52:28] <hirsty> ah right >.>
[08:53:03] <hirsty> well usually id stick the breakpoint on the first var call in the func ur calling and see if it calls it
[08:53:32] <hirsty> if not, stick it to the first thing called before it
[08:53:38] <YamakasY> hirsty: yeah I just do console.log()
[08:54:10] <decx> btw firebug has been worse than the built in devtools for a while now
[08:54:50] <hirsty> >.>
[08:55:08] <hirsty> been working fine for me
[08:55:09] <YamakasY> yeah
[08:55:24] <decx> sure it works, but it's got atrocious performance
[08:55:27] <hirsty> how is it ur calling it?
[08:55:28] <YamakasY> damn I'm eating candy like crazy, cannot be good
[08:56:19] <hirsty> can spare a second pair of eyes for a few mins if u care to share anyway Yam
[09:05:16] <Serg_Penguin_> how would YOU write insertion to arbitrary position, given root element with surely empty .children() and quasi-infinite list of new elements to insert ?
[09:06:13] <Serg_Penguin_> $ul.__MAGICK__($li,n), __MAGICK__ = ?
[09:06:44] <decx> insertBefore nextSibling of Index
[09:09:52] <Serg_Penguin_> = insertAfter ?
[09:13:26] <decx> well there is no insertAfter in javascript
[09:13:46] <decx> that's why you insertBefore nextSibling
[09:15:11] <Serg_Penguin_> http://api.jquery.com/insertafter/
[09:17:13] <decx> that's just syntax reversed after
[09:17:18] <decx> which is insertBefore nextSibling
[09:24:47] <Duikb00t> Someone an idea what's missing here https://jsfiddle.net/8qu8br1w/12/  you should try to add some and remove some, when you remove the latest one it's bugging
[09:24:49] <Duikb00t> thx
[09:27:27] <taplar> right cause ln 14 won't work then
[09:28:44] <Duikb00t> in 14? :D
[09:28:59] <taplar> line
[09:29:31] <taplar> is it intended to let them remove them all?
[09:29:50] <Duikb00t> No I want to remove 'child by child'
[09:29:59] <taplar> not what i asked
[09:31:07] <Duikb00t> Not sure I understood your Q well.
[09:31:15] <taplar> your issue currently stems from leting the user remove all the children.  but is that actually valid?  should they be able to remove them all?
[09:31:34] <Duikb00t> I want to keep 1
[09:31:39] <Duikb00t> Once they clicked 'add children'
[09:31:46] <Duikb00t> So they can remove all except the first
[09:31:53] <taplar> so why not prevent the delete logic from removing the last one if it's the only one left
[09:32:05] <Duikb00t> $(this).parent().not(':first').remove();
[09:32:17] <decx> delete the remove button right after you set the clone
[09:33:16] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/8qu8br1w/13/  This way?
[09:33:31] <Duikb00t> decx:  and taplar do you guy live in this room ? :D
[09:33:45] <taplar> not sure how that's relevant to your issue, :P
[09:33:49] <decx> i'm like working
[09:34:00] <taplar> should we not be helping you?
[09:34:00] <decx> glory of multi screen setups
[09:34:07] <Duikb00t> Sure thanks ! :D
[09:34:09] <taplar> we can stop, :)
[09:34:14] <Duikb00t> haha
[09:37:53] <taplar> and yeah i kinda live in here 8-5.  use the place as a sort of continuous learning thing, :)
[10:14:06] <bongjovi> can anyone suggest how I would pass $this into the function closePop?
[10:14:07] <bongjovi> http://pastebin.com/FmYf0UhW
[10:14:19] <bongjovi> so I can use it as $container in that function
[10:15:41] <taplar> wait, your binding in an event handler?
[10:15:57] <bongjovi> yeah
[10:16:00] <taplar> nooooooo
[10:16:07] <taplar> nooooooooo
[10:16:09] <taplar> lol
[10:16:29] <bongjovi> it gets unbound as soon as anywhere else in the document is clicked
[10:18:32] <decx> just do off on a namespaced event
[10:19:20] <bongjovi> decx, could you point me to an example?
[10:19:26] <decx> sure
[10:19:28] <decx> .off()
[10:19:30] <decx> ^^
[10:19:38] <bongjovi> of a namespaced event
[10:19:43] <decx> it's like on but off
[10:19:45] <decx> oh
[10:20:00] <decx> well you can just do on('click.blah', fn)
[10:20:19] <decx> and then you can either off('click.blah') or off('.blah') for all events in that namespace
[10:20:25] <decx> or was it blah.click
[10:20:30] <decx> no i think it's trailing
[10:20:43] <bongjovi> ah i see
[10:22:14] <bongjovi> still doesn't avoid binding inside the event handler though?
[10:24:00] <decx> right it's either set a new event on doc but not target == container OR the whole overlay div with an event on it approach
[10:27:48] <bongjovi> so this is bad practice?
[10:27:49] <bongjovi> http://pastebin.com/zuBXaBKL
[10:28:39] <decx> no idea what's considered best practise for modals
[10:29:04] <EugenA> i have here jquery autocomplete widget, it works fine. I need to extend it, the selection list should only appear, if different field 'field1' has some value. If 'field1' is empty, autocomplete should not work (the list should not appear)
[10:29:18] <decx> i used the same set a new event that i kill soon without any problems tho
[10:32:02] <decx> use the minLength option EugenA
[10:32:13] <EugenA> thanks
[10:32:33] <decx> but that should be 1 by default anyway
[10:32:38] <decx> so no idea ^^
[10:42:33] <nick12> how do you guys approach coding functions that require backend data (json). There must be a better approach to firing up the actual server to return real data everytime you write a function
[10:43:48] <taplar> if your using a javascript testing library like jasmine you can mock stuff like that out
[10:43:58] <codecutter> really?
[10:44:02] <codecutter> hmm
[10:44:02] <taplar> yep
[10:44:19] <codecutter> i'll try that
[10:45:57] <taplar> or if your using something like qunit that doesn't do mocking/spying, from what i'm aware of, you might have to take a different approach
[10:45:58] <stemid> codecutter: well the classic approach is to separate your IO. so that you can write tests with mock data.
[10:46:53] <codecutter> right. how do you generate the mock data? e.g. when making a ajax call jquery expects a real server response, right?
[10:47:03] <taplar> you wouldn't do the ajax call
[10:47:09] <stemid> ajax is IO, you separate the IO from the rest of your code.
[10:47:19] <stemid> that way you can run your code without the IO
[10:47:23] <taplar> your ajax would call a method on success giving it the data
[10:47:30] <taplar> you'd test that method, not the ajax
[10:48:08] <taplar> you'd save the testing of the whole thing for integration tests
[10:48:19] <codecutter> i see
[10:49:54] <suexec> I'm using jQuery Mobile on a page I am making. I have a custom function that loads pages via $.ajax , fades out my main div, replaces content, then fades it in. This is working. If I create i.e a <ul> with the listview widget set (data-role="listview") on the page that I load, can I expect this to be treated by the existing javascript? (I am loading it, but its not working. Is my logic or code flawed?)
[10:58:47] <syosoft> hey guys, does anyone have a minute to help me with a clearInterval issue? http://pastebin.ca/3458078 autoTimeout.reset() doesn't seem to be stopping the countdown - when it calls this.init() and the prompt opens again, the countdown is going 2x or 3x, etc (depends on how many times it gets called).
[11:01:29] <taplar> i'm thinking your having some confusion with the use of 'this'
[11:02:23] <taplar> 'this' for the majority of the logic that you linked, would be the method they are within
[11:02:27] <syosoft> I 100% agree with you :)
[11:02:33] <syosoft> well, hence $.proxy()
[11:02:48] <syosoft> which, as far as i understand, allows you to change the context used within those functions...
[11:02:57] <syosoft> and, for the most part it's working everywhere else...
[11:03:38] <taplar> are you assuming 'this' is referring to the autoTimeout variable?
[11:04:17] <Z3R0_> Trying to do a $.post() … everything works fine on success, but on fail, I can’t seem to return any type of response data… $.post() .fail(function(a,b,c) { console.log(a,b,c); }); none of that is any response data...
[11:04:55] <taplar> Z3R0_: iirc look at the first element, it's the jqXHR.  it should have responseData or something on it
[11:05:07] <Z3R0_> oh let me check, I was used to looking for .data
[11:05:48] <Z3R0_> ic
[11:06:00] <syosoft> taplar, yes, that's whawt i was hoping.
[11:06:14] <taplar> syosoft:  you can just use 'autoTimeout' then
[11:06:17] <Z3R0_> responseJSON = object yay
[11:06:29] <taplar> since it's not like your instantiating multiple instances of it.  it's just an object
[11:06:33] <syosoft> oh.
[11:06:40] <syosoft> I thought it would init all over again...
[11:06:43] <syosoft> Lemme see what that does.
[11:07:30] <syosoft> But, doesn't that make this code less portable if i'm hard coding the object variable within it?
[11:07:32] <taplar> init is just a property of the object.  it's not going to execute unless you explicitly call it
[11:07:46] <taplar> what do you mean?
[11:08:01] <taplar> your creating the variable.  you know what you named it
[11:08:03] <Z3R0_> thank you ;)
[11:08:09] <taplar> it's not like that's going to be dynamic
[11:08:17] <syosoft> var autoTimeout = {}... if i reference autoTimeout from within autoTimeout and i later change the name autoTimeout to bananasAndCheese.. then ya know.
[11:08:21] <syosoft> hah, yes, i know
[11:08:41] <syosoft> Not a big JS custom object kind of guy, so this whole way of thinking was new to me.
[11:08:59] <taplar> if your concerned about that, you should look into closures
[11:09:27] <syosoft> clearInterval(autoTimeout._interval_countdown);
[11:09:40] <syosoft> didn't do anything... i'll try using the object name on set.
[11:10:00] <taplar> yep, any where your wanting to access an object level argument, you'd use that guy
[11:10:33] <syosoft> yea, had no effect, the interval still isn't clearing.
[11:12:29] <syosoft> just removed all of the "this." and $.proxy() wrappers and exact same issue... something weird is going on.
[11:15:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/19u69j7d/
[11:16:13] <syosoft> ah ok, very good - thanks for the time to set that up.
[11:20:36] <syosoft> Where you have console.log()
[11:20:41] <syosoft> i have self.showPrompt()
[11:20:49] <syosoft> and i'm getting self.showPrompt() is not a function
[11:21:07] <taplar> link?
[11:21:31] <syosoft> http://pastebin.ca/3458145
[11:22:10] <taplar> oh, self does not have any methods
[11:22:26] <taplar> it's just a reference to the, essentially, namespace
[11:23:45] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/19u69j7d/1/
[11:24:15] <syosoft> damn i'm a noob at this, thanks again.. trying.
[11:26:35] <redpanda_> Whats up guys im troubleshooting a strange issue where jquery-ui is coming up as "undefined" when running $.ui in console
[11:29:54] <taplar> what about jQuery.ui ?
[11:30:26] <syosoft> ok, so after all this, i'm 100% in the exact same boat.
[11:30:33] <syosoft> 2nd time prompt opens, countdown skips numbers.
[11:30:42] <taplar> link
[11:30:53] <syosoft> http://pastebin.ca/3458177
[11:31:12] <syosoft> i think initPrompt might be the culprit
[11:31:18] <syosoft> maybe i cannot set *everything* up *everytime*
[11:31:58] <taplar> i don't see where self is defined
[11:32:22] <syosoft> gah, right, i thought i didn't need it, once i used methods : {} self wasn't accessing anything for me.
[11:32:39] <spearsec-lonny> Chaps, I'd like to programmatically build an html file using jquery. So far I've done: var x = $("<html><head></head><body></body></html>"); x.find( "body" ).html( "foo" ); console.log( x.html() <-- returns undefined
[11:32:43] <spearsec-lonny> any ideas?
[11:32:45] <cryptomonk> Greetings, having an issue with DataTables. Anyone mind taking a look
[11:32:45] <cryptomonk> http://pastebin.com/11msz3u5
[11:33:12] <taplar> spearsec-lonny: building an entire webpage with js is not advised
[11:34:17] <spearsec-lonny> taplar, I'm using a WYSIWYG editor that returns the "body" of an html page. I need to fudge in the <head> and surrounding <html> tags. I could do it with strings, but I'd rather not if possible
[11:35:31] <taplar> ah, the whole iframe thing
[11:36:19] <taplar> in any case, iirc there's something with jquery eating html tags if you try to parse an entire html document in a varaible.  i forget the specifics
[11:36:32] <spearsec-lonny> yeah - thats what I've noticed. I'll continue to have a play
[11:36:38] <spearsec-lonny> thanks for the help taplar
[11:36:47] <taplar> not really much help, ^_^
[11:36:50] <Z3R0_> Anyone familiar with DataTables and columnDefs? Trying to use it to add edit / delete buttons to my ajax’d data, but it’s not replacing the content
[11:38:27] <cryptomonk> Is there a way to have DataTables sort a specific column desc on load
[11:38:53] <Z3R0_> sure
[11:39:04] <Z3R0_> "order": [[ 3, "desc" ]]
[11:39:12] <Z3R0_> where 3 = column number…
[11:39:19] <cryptomonk> tyvm
[11:41:10] <cryptomonk> Anyway to have stylize it so alternating rows have a different background color
[11:41:26] <Z3R0_> bootstrap?
[11:41:32] <cryptomonk> DataTables
[11:41:40] <Z3R0_> but not using bootstrap right ?
[11:41:51] <cryptomonk> I am and thats how I normally do it class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed"
[11:42:02] <cryptomonk> but since this is a DataTables table didnt seem to work
[11:42:04] <Z3R0_> bring in datatables.net-bs npm install package
[11:42:12] <Z3R0_> I’m using it just fine :)
[11:43:22] <Z3R0_> will be in the money soon as I get a fix for these columnDefs… *grrr*
[11:44:05] <Z3R0_> so far, it seems like columnDef’s don’t like to work with ajax’d objects… (or at least so far...)
[11:57:57] <Jittler> I have the shortest bit of code that works in the console but not in an external .js file with functions that are working. How do I go about finding out why? Pastebin for the relevant code: http://pastebin.com/YuF6rCpj (5 lines), link to the page: https://agirlandhermac.design/demo-executive-one-page/ .. link to the .js: https://agirlandhermac.design/demo-executive-one-page/wp-content/themes/Divi-child-01/ops-nav-effect.js
[11:59:09] <Jittler> When the window is <960px and you click a link in the mobile menu, the menu should close. The code not working is one that should trigger the menu toggle when you click on a link inside it.
[12:05:34] <Z3R0_> erm Jittler there is no mobile_menu_bar a
[12:06:23] <robertmaxrees> also: i might refactor that code out a bit - your scroll handler is crazy inefficient.
[12:06:54] <wfq> hi all
[12:07:26] <wfq> could anyone please give me a hint of how to send a file and some json with it to the server in one ajax call?
[12:07:34] <wfq> any article or hint I can follow please?
[12:07:51] <Z3R0_> Anyone familiar with working with DataTables ColumnDefs … having issues :(
[12:08:33] <syosoft> @ wfq http://pastebin.ca/3458284
[12:08:41] <syosoft> that's how I do it within foundation's reveal
[12:09:31] <wfq> syosoft but that is sending the file only. I would like to send some data with it too
[12:09:36] <syosoft> Sorry, didn't show you xhr2 - http://pastebin.ca/3458290
[12:09:42] <syosoft> actually, tha'ts sending 100% of the form.
[12:09:44] <syosoft> maybe try it first.
[12:10:41] <wfq> I know how to upload a file but I need to same as well data with it
[12:11:47] <syosoft> heh, what about that code makes you think it's *only* a file upload?
[12:12:55] <syosoft> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21044798/how-to-use-formdata-for-ajax-file-upload - checkout the 2nd answer, and try  things before you trust yourself to evalulate code without runningit.
[12:13:09] <wfq> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21044798/how-to-use-formdata-for-ajax-file-upload
[12:13:19] <syosoft> exaclty - nm, sorry I tried to help!
[12:13:22] <syosoft> good luck!
[12:13:35] <wfq> syosoft, thanks a lot
[12:13:52] <syosoft> (thou if you read, you'll see how answer #2 shows you exactly how tod o what you need).
[12:15:02] <Jittler> @Z3R0_ ... http://i.imgur.com/T8p1Eik.png ?  I'm not using >
[12:15:19] <Z3R0_> I didn’t mean you weren’t using it
[12:15:29] <Z3R0_> but the mobile_menu_trigger isn’t below that tag...
[12:16:19] <Jittler> I don't understand. It works in the console.. I'm not searching for .mobile_menu_bar_toggle as a child of that.
[12:16:25] <Z3R0_> ah sorry didn’t notice it wa s a trigger
[12:16:30] <Z3R0_> thought you were doing another on click event
[12:16:50] <robertmaxrees> you sure your html is valid Jittler?
[12:17:44] <Z3R0_> it looks fine, I’m looking at it, the click event works which “shows” teh menu
[12:17:44] <Jittler> Well it's not my site, but I did put a link to the page in chat. I'm not the designer/dev for the site, just someone trying to help a friend fix a weird thing on her site.
[12:17:54] <Z3R0_> but he can’t trigger click the menu again to hide it
[12:17:59] <robertmaxrees> jiott
[12:18:01] <Jittler> Showing the menu isn't the problem, clicking the menu items should close the menu
[12:18:28] <Z3R0_> oh oh
[12:18:29] <Z3R0_> Jittler:
[12:18:32] <Z3R0_> for shits and giggles… try
[12:18:35] <Z3R0_> #mobile_menu li a
[12:18:39] <Jittler> k sec
[12:20:31] <Jittler> Nothing.
[12:20:36] <Z3R0_> O.o
[12:20:44] <robertmaxrees> validate your markup.
[12:20:44] <Z3R0_> that is the exact html pathing...
[12:21:02] <Z3R0_> <ul id=“mobile_menu”><li><a></a></li></ul>
[12:21:07] <Jittler> Like I said, it works in the console but not in the external .js file.
[12:21:16] <robertmaxrees> the binding could be running early because you have bad html.
[12:21:34] <robertmaxrees> which causes jquery to think doc ready already fired when it's not time yet.
[12:21:48] <Jittler> Well it's a WordPress site with a bloated theme so I wouldn't be surprised. Is there a better hook to use than doc.ready?
[12:21:59] <robertmaxrees> fix the page.
[12:22:00] <robertmaxrees> that's the fix.
[12:22:11] <Z3R0_> have you tried adding fire events
[12:22:11] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're waiting for all assets to finish downloading, which can take a looong time.
[12:22:18] <Jittler> So basically, tell her it can't be done. Like I said, I'm not the dev for the site and I'm really not here to get my hands -that- dirty.
[12:22:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i said.
[12:22:26] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:22:32] <Z3R0_> { console.log(‘anchor clicked’); $(.moblle_menu_bat_toggle’).trigger(‘click’); }
[12:22:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd console log the selector before the binding to see if it exists.
[12:23:30] <robertmaxrees> there's a chance that content is created dynamically.  that would break it.
[12:23:42] <robertmaxrees> if that's the case, use a delegated listener instead.
[12:24:27] <Jittler> prevObject: m.fn.init[1], context: document, selector: "#mobile_menu a"] context : document length : 0 prevObject : m.fn.init[1] selector : "#mobile_menu a" __proto__ : Object[0]
[12:24:38] <Jittler> So basically the selector is empty when I'm calling it. Now we're making progress.
[12:24:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, do use a delegated listener.
[12:24:57] <Jittler> Uhh... yeah.. brb/Googling.
[12:25:02] <Z3R0_> lol saw that coming
[12:25:05] <Z3R0_> even i was like… wtf is that ?
[12:25:07] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:25:14] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[12:26:16] <arc_> it's an incredibly simple concept that only sounds complicated
[12:26:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:26:26] <robertmaxrees> and an important one to grasp.
[12:26:42] <Jittler> I uhh... thought I did it right, but no joy boys.
[12:26:49] <Jittler> brb/more Googlyness.
[12:26:50] <robertmaxrees> you didn't read the docs :)
[12:26:57] <robertmaxrees> check out the second example in that first link.
[12:27:14] <robertmaxrees> $( "#dataTable tbody tr" ).on( "click", function() { is not a delegated listener.
[12:27:15] <robertmaxrees> $( "#dataTable tbody" ).on( "click", "tr", function() { is
[12:27:26] <Jittler> $('#mobile_menu').on( "click", "a", function() {
[12:27:34] <robertmaxrees> mobile_menu doesn't exist.
[12:27:38] <robertmaxrees> so you can't bind on it.
[12:27:39] <Z3R0_> http://datatables.net/examples/ajax/null_data_source.html // so I followed this to a ’T’ but I’m not getting any button…
[12:27:42] <robertmaxrees> try binding up higher.
[12:27:52] <Z3R0_> bind to something static already that isn’t dynamically generated ;)
[12:27:57] <Jittler> Okay, okay. I get what you're saying.
[12:28:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:28:07] <robertmaxrees> that's why i linked those docs.
[12:28:12] <robertmaxrees> they explain all of that pretty clearly :)
[12:28:15] <Z3R0_> I know people used to always bind on body… but that seems like overkill
[12:28:21] <Jittler> Well, I understand the idea.. but figured #mobile_menu was static.
[12:28:23] <robertmaxrees> it is overkill.
[12:28:50] <Z3R0_> is it Jittler ? I thought it only showed if screen size was small
[12:29:03] <robertmaxrees> could use css to hide/show it.
[12:29:10] <Jittler> I'm about to throttle the page, refresh, and watch the HTML
[12:29:24] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:29:25] <Jittler> If that fails me, I'll trace some code and see how that stuff is being added.
[12:29:37] <robertmaxrees> or just use a delegated listener bound higher up and call it a day.
[12:29:46] <robertmaxrees> feel free to use body if you really want.
[12:29:52] <Z3R0_> it would get the job done at least ;)
[12:29:53] <Jittler> That's what she said.
[12:30:02] <robertmaxrees> *Sigh* anyway
[12:30:10] <Z3R0_> fix me :)
[12:33:37] <Z3R0_> yay I fixed it hhahahahah
[12:33:38] <Z3R0_> woot woot :)
[12:34:44] <Jittler> Nothing with: $('body').on( "click", "a", function() {    or    $('body').on( "click", "#main-header li a", function() {     or    $('#main-header').on( "click", "li > a", function() {     and console.log shows #main-header is a thing before that function so.. brb/more googles.
[12:35:00] <Jittler> I mean.. the first one says any link on the page, still no dice.. but brb
[12:35:24] <Z3R0_> that’s strange
[12:43:20] <Jittler> $('#main-header').on( "click", "#mobile_menu > li", function() {    and clicking the li does nothing either. The click event listener is definitely hooked on #main-header, it just won't fire. I will get this.
[12:44:00] <robertmaxrees> try the body
[12:56:55] <Jittler> no dice on body.. going to pick my gf up from work then come back and hit this again
[13:12:24] <winegoddess> hi all. what tools do you use when testing jquery mobile?  are there any emulators/simulators other than xcode or android to test locally?
[13:12:37] <robertmaxrees> chrome has a mobile emulation view.
[13:12:41] <robertmaxrees> not perfect, but generally close enough.
[13:13:29] <winegoddess> thanks robertmaxrees - i didnt realize, i will check it out.
[13:24:34] <islalobo> What's the best way to retry ajax call after if fails?
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> if it's actually failing, do it again in the fail callback.
[13:25:24] <robertmaxrees> though i'd prevent the failure in the first place
[13:25:49] <islalobo> There's a timeout when it's calling an external db, I think
[13:26:02] <islalobo> I was looking at this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10024469/whats-the-best-way-to-retry-an-ajax-request-on-failure-using-jquery
[13:28:11] <taplar> do you own the db?
[13:28:31] <taplar> admin/maintain
[13:28:34] <taplar> ?
[13:28:45] <islalobo> yes
[13:29:00] <taplar> have you done any investigation into optimizing the query?
[13:29:37] <z1haze> how could I delay some code to run on pade load?
[13:29:45] <robertmaxrees> .load
[13:30:10] <robertmaxrees> though why would you do that?
[13:30:48] <z1haze> I have a weird issue with my tabs the height is getting messed up, i think I need to wait until everything it loaded all the way to initialize my tabs
[13:32:13] <z1haze> i dont see how .load solves that issue
[13:32:18] <z1haze> im not loading ajax
[13:32:26] <robertmaxrees> document load.
[13:32:31] <robertmaxrees> the event handler.
[13:32:54] <robertmaxrees> but i'd fix your css.  shouldn't need js to do that.
[13:33:28] <islalobo> taplar: time is of the essence, unfortunately. We need a hacky fix for the moment
[13:33:40] <islalobo> (but yes, long term we're looking at it)
[13:33:52] <taplar> it doesn't take long to figure out if your hitting an index
[13:36:25] <islalobo> Okay, thanks
[14:02:22] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, is that different from document .ready?
[14:02:44] <taplar> document ready executes once the dom is parsed
[14:02:58] <z1haze> is there an event that triggers after that?
[14:02:59] <taplar> load executes once resources are fully loaded (images, other media)
[14:03:06] <z1haze> ah ok
[14:03:22] <z1haze> so like $(window).bind("load", function() {
[14:03:40] <taplar> would execute once the page has fully loaded everything
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:03:48] <robertmaxrees> .load
[14:04:04] <robertmaxrees> that's a hack though
[14:04:18] <z1haze> how do i correctly do it
[14:04:23] <z1haze> if load is a hack
[14:04:27] <taplar> i figured it'd be on('load'
[14:04:28] <robertmaxrees> fix your CSS so your nav issue isn't a problem.
[14:04:56] <z1haze> who said anything about a nav
[14:05:10] <robertmaxrees> coulda sworn you did.  weird.
[14:05:19] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to wait until after assets have finished loading?
[14:05:43] <z1haze> because im making tabs
[14:05:50] <robertmaxrees> and my bad, i was confusing the .load() handler with the document ready syntaxt in that .load() IS a shortcut for .on('load'
[14:05:55] <robertmaxrees> but you can'd to .on('ready'
[14:06:06] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i don't understand what that has to do with anything.
[14:06:40] <z1haze> well i have a footer thats positioned at the bottom
[14:06:48] <z1haze> and im guessing that since everything isnt loaded yet
[14:06:55] <z1haze> its misjudging the height
[14:07:01] <z1haze> as shown here https://gyazo.com/b9acf8cd949f928c65603b7a83b18f4a
[14:08:10] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don't see what any of this has to do with js.
[14:08:15] <z1haze> jesus
[14:08:21] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:08:25] <z1haze> the tabs are initialized with js
[14:08:40] <z1haze> that area of content in the GIF is a tab thats generated on document ready
[14:09:02] <robertmaxrees> right.  are you positiining things using JS when that happens?
[14:09:34] <z1haze> im not. the plugin does a lot of positioning
[14:09:39] <z1haze> abs values and stuff
[14:09:41] <robertmaxrees> i can't see your code so i'm trying to wrap my head around the problem.  generating content shouldn't have an impact on any of that so i'm trying to understand how this is all related.
[14:10:03] <z1haze> http://tabtab.be/
[14:10:06] <z1haze> this is the tab plugin
[14:10:46] <z1haze> since im using a fixed footer, if it loads too soon before all the content is loaded, the footer is misplaced
[14:10:55] <z1haze> i need to wait to initialize the tabs until everything is in place
[14:13:04] <AddValues> I know I'm doing it wrong, but why doesn't the values add up rather than merging? https://jsfiddle.net/1t0mn9u8/1/
[14:13:35] <robertmaxrees> because $extraSavings is a string.
[14:13:59] <robertmaxrees> parseFloat() it first.
[14:15:52] <AddValues> robertmaxress: thanks!
[14:20:05] <AddValues> @robertmaxrees: so by parseFloat() I turned my string into a number and allowed the += operator to add it up?
[14:20:21] <AddValues> Just want to make sure I understand, I fixed my issue however
[14:20:45] <robertmaxrees> basically.  $group.find('span').text() gets you a string.
[14:21:16] <robertmaxrees> + with strings is for concatenation
[14:22:20] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you could map over $('.cell-group') and then reduce the array that comes out.
[14:22:29] <robertmaxrees> but that depends on how funky you want to be.
[14:25:07] <AddValues> Ah ok, so for strings using += is like putting 'snow' and 'ball' together, thanks a lot!
[14:25:14] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:25:20] <robertmaxrees> gotta be explicit with your types.
[14:36:39] <ShaunR> I want to toggle a change() on a input that is selected on a page load.  $('input[name=myinput]:checked').change(); should do that right?
[14:42:43] <stemid> why can't I get this simple form submit to work? https://jsfiddle.net/cjxmvuy0/2/ I get this text: {"error": "Shell form does not validate{'html_initial_name': u'initial-js_lib', 'form': <mooshell.forms.ShellForm object at 0x2b75310>, 'html_name': 'js_lib', 'html_initial_id': u'initial-id_js_lib', 'label': u'Js lib', 'field': <django.forms.models.ModelChoiceField object at 0x4e94210>, 'help_text': '', 'name
[14:42:49] <stemid> ': 'js_lib'}{'html_initial_name': u'initial-js_wrap', 'form': <mooshell.forms.ShellForm object at 0x2b75310>, 'html_name': 'js_wrap', 'html_initial_id': u'initial-id_js_wrap', 'label': u'Js wrap', 'field': <django.forms.fields.TypedChoiceField object at 0x4e948d0>, 'help_text': '', 'name': 'js_wrap'}"}
[14:42:54] <stemid> seems like an issue with jsfiddle
[14:45:49] <stemid> uh weird, my external jquery resource was missing.
[14:45:54] <stemid> that was the problem
[14:54:49] <jose3_> Hello World
[14:55:09] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/rWNVbfKp/
[14:55:29] <ShaunR> I have a page that loads and php set a "selected" on a radio input that was previously selected.  I'm trying to get the value of that radio on page load by doing $(function() { alert($('input[name=image]:checked').val()); }); but i keep getting "undefined"
[14:55:31] <ShaunR> anybody know why
[14:55:45] <jose3_> I am adding 4 hours to the time because of a timezone issue, where my time is off by a day, does anyone know how I can do this in a less hacky way?
[15:05:00] <z1haze> I havea strange issue with a jquery tabs plugin causing different gaps at the bottom of it for different pepople. I am using tabtab.be plugin and an example here: http://testlist.hendricksweb.com/featured can anyone please tell me if there is a substantial gap between the page content and the footer?
[15:06:17] <jose3_> thats perrrty
[15:06:59] <z1haze> the gap, is it large like it should be or squished down?
[15:08:35] <kedgen> Can someone help me understand how to use off()? Do I need to call .off() from the same context that the original .on() was called from?
[15:13:17] <shoky> kedgen: needs to be on the same element(s)
[15:20:51] <kedgen> shoky: does it matter if the scope that the function is called from is different?
[15:22:40] <shoky> kedgen: no
[15:22:53] <pjfl> hello. can anyone tell me how i can set the caret in some specific position in a div content editable = "true"
[15:24:33] <shoky> pjfl: google has good results for "set the caret in some specific position in a div content editable"
[15:26:46] <kedgen> shoky: it seems that even if the element selector is the same, the event type is the same, and the function that is fired is the same, off is not removing the handler
[15:27:11] <shoky> kedgen: make a jsfiddle
[15:27:38] <shoky> you don't have to pass a function to .off
[15:28:02] <shoky> unless you want to remove only that specific handler
[15:28:16] <kedgen> shoky: it has other handlers that I want to keep on the function
[15:28:28] <kedgen> I will make a fiddle and see if the same problem occurs
[15:37:28] <kedgen> shoky: I'm stumped. It works in JSFiddle. I don't see any difference between what I'm doing there and in my code (though it's much more complex)... In both cases I'm targeting the same element and passing along the same handler
[15:38:28] <shoky> kedgen i'll be happy to take a look if you got a live link to your site.. tho gotta go for a bit
[15:38:51] <kedgen> shoky: no worries, I think I found a lead haha
[15:38:58] <shoky> sweet
[15:38:59] <kedgen> thanks for offering though
[15:49:52] <pjfl> shoky
[15:50:27] <pjfl> shoky i have google it first, but the problem its the caret cames always to the position 0
[15:50:44] <pjfl> if someone can have a look i apreciate
[15:50:45] <pjfl> https://jsfiddle.net/jwyubxkr/
[16:06:33] <jose3_> howdy
[16:06:42] <jose3_> can someone help me with some js time stuff?
[16:38:13] <duch_kazatel> weeeeee
[17:07:27] <Side_FX> Does anyone have any experience uploading a file to the server through ajax?
[17:15:33] <pjfl> yes
[17:15:43] <pjfl> what type of file you need
[17:16:11] <pjfl> side fx are toy there
[17:22:21] <SomethingBlue> Is there a reason why my $savings would come out to NaN? https://jsfiddle.net/14ayaLux/2/ when I console log my variables (value and savings) they return exactly how it is in the fiddle, but when I try to append I return NaN
[17:22:58] <SomethingBlue> oh boy, visit that url with out the /1/ lol
[17:29:02] <jerit> what url?
[17:45:51] <shoky> pjfl: that's tricky when you replace a text node with text+link+text.. the caret position is only inside whatever text-node it's in, not in the full text..
[17:46:32] <shoky> pjfl: donno of a simple way to do it, you'd need to traverse each node and do a bit of calculations :S
[17:53:09] <pjfl> shoky, but i am setting the position only after replace all the text. that function runs before i run the function to setthe carret
[17:54:02] <shoky> pjfl: it runs everytime you input text.. so it will run again after you replaced with link.  and anyway the setCaret is run after the replace
[17:56:27] <pjfl> shoky: That's correct.. should't place the caret in the position i am passing to the function?
[17:58:07] <pjfl> because I getThe position -> replace the text -> setPostion( initial position). the node will be the same text + 1 letter
[18:03:20] <shoky> pjfl first of all your code has:  range.setStart(el.childNodes, pos);
[18:03:36] <shoky> pjfl: which is wrong because el.childNodes is a list of nodes, not a node
[18:04:44] <shoky> pjfl:  but even if you change it to e.g.  range.setStart(el.childNodes[0], pos);    that will just look at the FIRST text-node,  but if you have #text then you replace it with a link, and you no longer have just ONE text node
[18:05:04] <shoky> so both the get and the set are wrong
[18:05:24] <pjfl> ok I understand that now
[18:07:23] <pjfl> even if I add other tag i will have multiple nodes.. text + tag + text + tag + tag will have for example 5 nodes instead just one
[18:08:33] <shoky> yep
[18:11:31] <pjfl> what you think is the best solution to solve this problem?
[18:19:17] <shoky> donno, sorry. dealing with text selection is always nasty :|
[18:19:34] <shoky> you need to traverse all the nodes
[18:26:33] <fred_> hi!
[18:26:40] <fred_> I hope everyone is fine
[18:27:36] <Guest7348> I am working on a custom search function and at this point I am running out of ideas
[18:27:59] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:28:27] <Guest7348> I have a Div container and inside many Divs with data-attributes
[18:28:36] <robertmaxrees> soooo make a fiddle ;)
[18:28:47] <Guest7348> good idea, one second
[18:30:22] <jerit> remember, if you can't do a thing simply then you don't understand how to do it
[18:33:21] <Guest7348> the basic idea I keep in mind is to search using data-attributes and filter them by the user input. Like the SQL Server %Like%
[18:33:40] <Guest7348> I will finish soon the jsfiddle to show to the community and thank you for reading me :D
[18:43:24] <Guest7348> hi!
[18:43:37] <Guest7348> i complete the jsfiddle
[18:43:39] <Guest7348> here it is
[18:43:53] <Guest7348> https://jsfiddle.net/Lros1v2s/
[18:44:11] <Guest7348> i feel i am close to achieve the function i am looking for
[18:44:22] <Guest7348> does anyone have time to help me?
[18:44:44] <taplar> what part are you having an issue with?
[18:44:54] <Guest7348> hi taplar, on the filter part
[18:45:24] <Guest7348> the idea i have in mind is to search in the same was as SQL %Like% does
[18:45:55] <Guest7348> i still trying
[18:47:03] <taplar> your wanting to search data tags?
[18:47:12] <Guest7348> correct
[18:47:32] <taplar> i believe contains matches against innerHTML
[18:47:58] <taplar> are you wanting to match against a specific data element?
[18:48:05] <Guest7348> $(this).attr("data-fname") === mySearchCriteria // this works but I need to be exact with the same content
[18:49:07] <Guest7348> i want to match similar elements and keep showing, and elements that doesn't match: hide them
[18:49:08] <taplar> or just any of those 4 data elements?
[18:50:14] <Guest7348> for example, you enter: sister
[18:50:24] <Guest7348> and just the div 3 will be displayed
[18:50:43] <taplar> your not answering my question.  you got at least 4 data elements it looks like
[18:50:44] <Guest7348> does it make sense for you?
[18:50:55] <taplar> if you enter a value, which one(s) should it match against?
[18:51:12] <Guest7348> sorry
[18:51:38] <Guest7348> if you enter a value, it sould match against: data-fname, data-lname, data-comments
[18:52:08] <taplar> and if the search criteria is blank it should show them all?
[18:52:14] <Guest7348> and that matching should be case insensitive ( I will put all of them in lowercase)
[18:52:38] <Guest7348> yes! if the matching criteria is empty, show all
[18:52:48] <Guest7348> because there is nothing to search
[18:57:00] <taplar> something like this maybe: https://jsfiddle.net/Lros1v2s/1/
[18:58:14] <Guest7348> let me see :)
[18:58:22] <Guest7348> first, thank you so much for your time
[18:58:36] <taplar> np, s'what the room is here for
[18:59:23] <ABM_Dan> Quick issue: I redirect a user after he picks a value from a select, but the problem is that I have some values in the select that have forward slashes
[18:59:36] <ABM_Dan> is there a way for me to easily escape the output of .val() ?
[18:59:47] <taplar> encodeURIComponent
[19:00:46] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent
[19:01:23] <ABM_Dan> Yeah I saw that, I was wondering if there was something else that wouldn't necessarily encode all characters.
[19:01:36] <taplar> it doesn't encode them all
[19:02:02] <taplar> "encodeURIComponent escapes all characters except the following: alphabetic, decimal digits, - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )"
[19:02:10] <ABM_Dan> encodeURIComponent('foo bar') returns "foo%20bar" instead of "foo+bar";
[19:02:18] <taplar> sure
[19:02:30] <ABM_Dan> That's my only qualm.
[19:03:34] <taplar> if it matters that much to you replace them after the fact
[19:03:38] <taplar> ex: '%20aaa%20'.replace(/%20/g, ' ');
[19:04:31] <taplar> or change it to +, *shrug*
[19:07:04] <ABM_Dan> It's mostly about not making urls unreadable unless needed.
[19:07:16] <taplar> who reads urls?
[19:08:06] <taplar> not sure why that's an issue.  so long as your code can interpret it correctly
[19:10:48] <Guest7348> hey @taplar, quick question: why did you use var $tileMains (the $ sign first) ?
[19:10:59] <taplar> to denote that it's already a jquery object
[19:11:12] <taplar> so later i know not to try to do $($tileMains)
[19:11:21] <taplar> since it wouldn't be of any benifit
[19:11:33] <Guest7348> thank you for explain me :)
[19:12:13] <ABM_Dan> Oh so that's a widespread thing, cool.
[19:12:23] <ABM_Dan> I'm not crazy \o/
[19:12:30] <taplar> well, for some.  some do it cause they come from php
[19:12:41] <taplar> and put it on everything, :)
[19:24:14] <Guest7348> taplar, thank you so much, may I buy you a cup of coffee?
[19:24:24] <taplar> i'm good, :)
[19:24:43] <Guest7348> the solution you provide me works so nice!
[19:24:51] <taplar> you understand what it's doing?
[19:24:55] <Guest7348> taplar, do you believe in God?
[19:25:08] <taplar> sure
[19:25:18] <Guest7348> ok, in that case, God bless you :)
[19:25:34] <Guest7348> and yes, I understood what the code was doing
[19:25:41] <taplar> good deal, that's the important part
[19:26:15] <taplar> not meant to be a statement about yourself, it's the goal of the room
[19:26:52] <Guest7348> thank you so much!
[19:27:20] <Guest7348> keep rocking taplar!
[19:27:39] <taplar> only until my functional tests finish, ;)
[19:29:22] <LavaSalesman> Is there a decent MVC-like way to back jquery-ui widgets with data?
[19:30:55] <printForever> any suggestion for jQuery modal plugin?
[19:49:42] <printForever> or checkbox replacement?
[19:50:18] <taplar> jquery ui or mobile may have something
[19:52:40] <taplar> maybe a switch would be more user friendly? http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/docs/forms/switch/
[19:52:59] <printForever> found it
[19:53:01] <printForever> tnx taplar
[19:56:50] <taplar> yes!  green tests.  l8r all, ^_^
[20:43:50] <phgilliam> Hey!
[20:44:40] <phgilliam> I am having problems with  .animation() on a .hover()
[20:44:43] <phgilliam> http://codepen.io/p_dennis_/pen/RaxLPd
[20:44:59] <phgilliam> the right side is spazzing out pretty hard
[20:47:02] <phgilliam> I can’t seem to figure out why
[21:06:42] <SomeQuest> Is there a reason something like this would return NaN? $var = $var_two; when $var_two is a number?
[21:25:22] <phgilliam> http://codepen.io/p_dennis_/pen/RaxLPd
[21:25:32] <phgilliam> can’t figure out why the right side is spazing out
[21:29:42] <SomeQuest> @phgilliam why not animate with CSS?
[21:30:16] <phgilliam> how would I get the other element to adjust?
[21:32:21] <SomeQuest> #left:hover + #right { background-color: yellow; }
[21:35:11] <phgilliam> I tried that initially
[21:50:55] <phgilliam> okay, I think I am close
