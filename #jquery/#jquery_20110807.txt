[00:04:57] <asadpakistani> if a parent div has an event binded to it, is there a way to make one of it's childs not respond to that event?
[00:06:51] <gnarf> asadpakistani: yes and no
[00:07:05] <gnarf> asadpakistani: whats happening is known as "bubbling"
[00:07:28] <gnarf> the event parameter has a target property: event.target
[00:07:39] <gnarf> that will tell you which element was say "click"ed
[00:08:17] <asadpakistani> gnarf: so how should i go about doing this...i did a .hover on the child element and returns false
[00:08:28] <asadpakistani> gnarf: that didnt do anythign the event still bubbles
[00:08:48] <gnarf> asadpakistani: which event?
[00:09:15] <asadpakistani> gnarf: event.preventDefault() doesnt do much either....the parent has binded mouseover and mouseenter
[00:09:35] <gnarf> try mouseenter mouseleave not mousein / mouseout
[00:09:52] <asadpakistani> gnarf: and return false?
[00:10:07] <gnarf> ?mdc mouseenter
[00:10:15] <bot-t> gnarf, jspage - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Jetpack/jspage?action=edit
[00:11:15] <gnarf> mouseenter & mouseleave do not bubble
[00:11:30] <gnarf> they are the ones you want to use for a "hover" event
[00:11:39] <gnarf> if you're binding the right one....
[00:13:45] <asadpakistani> gnarf: u are my hero...it works :D
[00:13:45] <ktada> what is diffrence between jquery mobile and jquery?
[00:14:16] <ktada> can I use jquery for mobile devices?
[00:14:19] <coldhead> jQuery is the write less do more javascript library
[00:14:32] <coldhead> jQuery mobile is a frame that uses jQuery and targets mobile devices
[00:14:45] <buttersb> any bbq experience gnarf?
[00:15:15] <coldhead> i think gnarf is vegetarian
[00:15:47] <gnarf> lol
[00:15:48] <buttersb> heh
[00:15:52] <asadpakistani> gnarf: u have no idea how long ive been trying to figure this out...<3 no homo
[00:16:05] <gnarf> i've used it before
[00:16:21] <buttersb> its being a lil tricky.
[00:16:29] <asadpakistani> any work is being done with jquery and webgl?
[00:16:37] <buttersb> im doing pushState, and then have my hashchange handler, but no dice
[00:17:44] <coldhead> jquery and webgl operate on different platforms
[00:17:53] <coldhead> there's not really much overlap
[00:18:08] <buttersb> webcl perhaps...
[00:19:03] <coldhead> its kind of like saying is there any work being done with jQuery and the french language
[00:19:13] <coldhead> i mean there's nothing stopping you but...

[00:49:15] <molavy> hi,i want live update table
[00:49:49] <molavy> table has 10 last change from db
[00:53:28] <molavy> any idea?
[00:56:03] <molavy> there is no idea?
[00:59:27] <molavy> how can implement this

[01:27:21] <molavy> what is differ between long polling and comet
[01:27:22] <molavy> ?
[01:29:14] <coldhead> i don't know, molavy
[01:29:26] <coldhead> it's probably not important
[01:34:19] <Light-> molavy, comet refers to server push in general and long polling is a method of enabling server push
[01:36:47] <molavy> i want live connection between client and server for get last 10 added rows to db
[01:37:50] <Light-> then you should be able to do it via long polling, client establishes connection and receives data, server doesnt close connection and keeps sending data as necessary
[01:38:18] <Light-> you might need to send some "keep-alive" data incase the client decides the server is inactive and closes the connection
[01:45:46] <wangdoo> hello
[01:45:51] <wangdoo> I have a table,in which each tr is a record and each td is a column.When I use click event a nd click on tr,I need both tr id and 6th column td id. both tr and td id should be assigned to a variable.
[01:46:07] <wangdoo> How to do this with selector
[01:47:43] <wangdoo> colint: I have a table,in which each tr is a record and each td is a column.When I use click event a nd click on tr,I need both tr id and 6th column td id. both tr and td id should be assigned to a variable.

[01:58:34] <Light-> wangdoo: assuming "this" is the tr, try $(this).find("td:nth-child(6)")
[01:59:14] <Light-> so $(this).attr("id") and $(this).find("td:nth-child(6)").attr("id")
[01:59:26] <molavy> what about server side? can i use apache and django live connection
[01:59:28] <molavy> ?
[02:00:27] <Light-> im not sure, I mainly use asp.net in which you enter it into a blocking loop and not call Response.End() and just keep Response.Write()'ing data and flushing at regular intervals
[02:00:40] <Light-> so dont know how to do it with apache/python
[02:02:13] <astropirate> I have a div that is  overflow:hidden;  how can i get all of the divs that are not "overflowing"
[02:02:25] <astropirate> *inside of that parent div
[02:03:20] <Light-> iterate over all the divs and check if they have the "overflow:hidden" property. if they do, add them to a list
[02:03:23] <Spadeski> #div .div2 { overflow:hidden;}
[02:03:33] <Spadeski> oops not css room lol
[02:04:04] <Light-> eg var divs = {}; $("parent-div").each(function() { if ($(this).css("overflow") == "hidden") { divs.push(this); } });
[02:04:26] <Light-> sorry, $("parent-div").find("div").each(....)
[02:04:34] <astropirate> Light-, i am looking for the child divs that are visible
[02:04:43] <Spadeski> Hey im tryon to get a username and password on my site then when they login to my site it triggers a jquery thats makes a div popup onto the left collum
[02:04:52] <astropirate> only the parent has the overflow:hidden property
[02:05:06] <Light-> ok then reverse it, if ($(this).css("overflow") != "hidden") { ... }
[02:05:30] <astropirate> lol the children do not have the overflow property
[02:05:39] <astropirate> a container has that property not the objects within it
[02:06:02] <Light-> ok perhaps I have misread your question, but essentially youd need to iterate over them and filter out the ones that match your condition
[02:06:18] <astropirate> yes that is my question indeed
[02:06:27] <astropirate> but *how* do i filter is the question
[02:06:39] <astropirate> because they are all visible
[02:06:43] <astropirate> they just aren't being shown
[02:06:53] <Light-> if their parent is hidden, then all the children will be
[02:07:07] <Light-> its a feature I believe
[02:07:21] <Spadeski> Hey im tryon to get a username and password on my site then when they login to my site it triggers a jquery thats makes a div popup onto the left collum
[02:08:12] <astropirate> Light-, the window is visible, are you sure you know what overflow: hidden does?
[02:08:47] <astropirate> *parent div
[02:08:51] <astropirate> not window
[02:14:22] <Chov> Hi guys, wondering if someone could help me out... I'm using datepicker to set dates on 2 input fields in a form. I then calculate a third field (the amount of days) from the 2 date input fields. I then take the third field and a span in the page and calculate a price ($ x days). This all works properly.
[02:14:32] <Chov> However the form uses Ajax and when ajax reloads the form (validation failure) changing the dates in the first 2 fields no longer recalculates the third field (days) nor the price. I'm not a js expert so I'm sure I'm missing something obvious here... here's my code: http://jsfiddle.net/jatfj/
[02:16:49] <astropirate> eurika!
[02:18:33] <Light-> astropirate, ah shit haha I thought you were talking about visibility:hidden the whole time
[02:19:00] <Light-> well im pretty sure the same rule applies though, if the parent is set to hide any overflow, then theres nothing the children can do about it
[02:20:18] <astropirate> actually i figured it out :D
[02:21:09] <astropirate> they are all positioned absolutely* and knowing the size and location of the parent div one can itterate over the children and see if their location fits within the prante div :D

[04:32:59] <Nitrxgen> so I have a simple animation in jQuery where someone clicks on a DIV and it changes the contents to something new every time, the animation fades out and fades the new one in
[04:34:02] <Nitrxgen> if I click on the DIV multiple times in a second, it slowly fades out and in and continues long after I triggered it; probably due to the queue
[04:34:02] <rhino> I am having trouble hoghlighting the parent div of the parent of an input when the input checkbox is checked.  Here is the fiddle.  Basically, I am trying to highlight both the span and the parent div with the class of '.folder'  Here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/WmAD4/
[04:36:05] <rhino> any ideas???
[04:36:34] <Nitrxgen> looking
[04:37:08] <SoulRaven> coldhead: is not working, because i want to hide/show the rows under No.0002.........., not the rows that contains header class
[04:40:39] <Nitrxgen> rhino, there I am trying your code and jquery wasn't even in the framework lol
[04:41:46] <Nitrxgen> rhino,    $(this).parent('div').toggleClass('highlightselected');
[04:43:04] <Nitrxgen> rhino, http://jsfiddle.net/WmAD4/1/
[04:43:17] <coldhead> SoulRaven: so take out the bit where it .add('.header')
[04:43:50] <coldhead> come on bro, you can figure this out :D
[04:44:43] <coldhead> molavy: put your code inside ready() and it won't run until jQuery is loaded
[04:44:53] <coldhead> you shouldn't have to check for jQuery
[04:45:42] <rhino> Nitrxgen:  I need highlight the div with the class of '.folder' though.  I think I typed in the wrong class before
[04:45:59] <rhino> so that ACDC is highlighted

[04:46:01] <bot-t> Nitrxgen, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[04:46:20] <coldhead> you can generally just say .stop().fadeIn() or whatever you need
[04:46:52] <coldhead> and it will cancel any previously queued animations
[04:46:56] <molavy> yes i do it it self
[04:46:58] <Nitrxgen> rhino, but that would highlight the whole list
[04:47:13] <Nitrxgen> well, just change the background of the whole list anyway
[04:48:05] <rhino> Nitrxgen:  I just need to highlight the one parent div, not the entire class
[04:48:15] <Nitrxgen> coldhead, cheers, but is there a way to not animate the change until the last animation finished? instead of stopping it suddenly and running a new animation
[04:48:51] <Nitrxgen> by not animate it, I meant not add it to the queue
[04:49:23] <SoulRaven> coldhead: i don't know, realy i don't know, i nead the select the rows from the secund row, and hide/show them when i click on the row with header class
[04:50:17] <rhino> Nitrxgen: I have tried $(this).parent('div').parent('div').parent('div').toggleClass('highlightselected');, but it obviously doesn't work
[04:50:35] <coldhead> Nitrxgen: that sounds like how the queue already works >: |
[04:50:53] <coldhead> maybe read up on how the queue works and you can unschedule selected items
[04:51:09] <coldhead> or read the docs on stop to try some of its variations
[04:51:40] <rhino> Nitrxgen:  any ideas?
[04:51:51] <Nitrxgen> gotta take a call, sec
[04:51:57] <SoulRaven> coldhead: each header row, has a number of rows under, the rows under has a TR, so when i click on the row that has header class, i want to show/hide the rows under

[04:56:31] <adtaylor> What would be the best practice with keeping HTML and CSS snippets/templates in a plugin? Should they be kept off the $ namespace in a pluginNameAssets var, or is it more efficient to keep them inside of $.pluginName?
[04:57:24] <coldhead> it shouldn't matter efficiency-wise, they should both be constant time to access
[04:57:36] <coldhead> but it's cleaner to keep them all in one place
[04:57:56] <coldhead> $.yourPlugin and $.yourPluginOtherStuff is fugly
[05:00:40] <adtaylor> coldhead: Thank you. Does the community have standard/default way of keeping markup in a plugin? Looks wrong having markup as big dirty strings!

[05:12:04] <larsemil> http://labs.daladevelop.se/dddrumr the night hack result
[05:13:14] <rhino> adtaylor:  also, won't using the class selector highlight all of the elements with that class?  I just need to select the one directly above it
[05:14:19] <adtaylor> rhino: no because you are using parent() which look for the parent element
[05:15:05] <rhino> adtaylor:  is there any function that will allow me to select that span containing the ACDC text?
[05:17:08] <rhino> adtaylor:  would .prev() work?
[05:20:16] <adtaylor> rhino — no because it is several nodes away http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[05:20:30] <adtaylor> You will be able to do what you want to BUT it won't be pretty or efficent
[05:20:49] <adtaylor> I'd look to re-factor your markup
[05:21:17] <rhino> adtaylor:  can you show me what that code would look like?
[05:22:05] <adtaylor> ul#allFiles>li+h2+ul>li.files It would make it a lot easier to traverse

[05:51:59] <fotoflo> how does Jquery handle this
[05:52:08] <fotoflo> can you point me to the write docs?
[05:52:14] <fotoflo> $("#historyList").append('<li id = "history' + i + '"><a href = "' + results[i].url + '">' + results[i].title + '</a></li>');
[05:52:18] <fotoflo> so ugly...
[06:33:48] <redleaderuk> Hello jquery people
[06:34:15] <redleaderuk> I have a question which I think is pretty easy for experienced people to answer!
[06:35:43] <redleaderuk> I have a mouseover event make a box fade out and a mouse out event make it fade back in again.  However, if I mouseover and mouse out quickly, several times, the fading in and out keeps looping.
[06:35:58] <redleaderuk> How do I make it so it doesn't loop like that?
[06:36:45] <redleaderuk> Does that make sense?
[06:43:17] <redleaderuk> Wow. 763 people in the room and I don't think any one is actually watching the channel!
[06:57:02] <raviteja> Hi query people, are jquery templates are stable enough to use in production?
[07:01:24] <tman_> hi
[07:01:30] <tman_> sorry im new
[07:03:57] <wao> w 19
[07:04:38] <redleaderuk> Ah ha!  I fixed my problem.  I needed to use .stop() on the effects.
[07:14:08] <tman_> can someone help me, im totally confused
[07:29:02] <pif> hi, if I put some javascript inside a page using div.innerHTML it is not executed, but with jq's html() method it is, how come?
[07:31:09] <fotoflo> 		var widgets = $("body").find(".widget");
[07:31:09] <fotoflo> 		widgets[1].prepend('<br />');
[07:31:15] <fotoflo> why doesn't this work?
[07:31:56] <tman_> how come this does not work $('p div').each(function(i, el) { alert('Element ' + i + ' has the following html: ' + $(el).html() + "<br />");});
[07:32:13] <fotoflo> oh
[07:32:14] <fotoflo> found it
[07:32:29] <fotoflo> $(widgets[1]).doStuff works
[07:32:35] <tman_> but if i chang the p to ul and the div to li then it works
[07:47:59] <outer_space> how could I take all of the values of input elements and make a string separated by ","?
[07:48:34] <outer_space> $('input').val().join(',')
[07:48:39] <outer_space> or something like that?
[07:51:13] <tman_> how come this does not work $('p div').each(function(i, el) { alert('Element ' + i + ' has the following html: ' + $(el).html() + "<br />");});
[07:58:47] <Paganini> hello you lovely jquery people! is there a way to post the information from a button click but without actually clicking it... I want to iterate through a bunch of 'no' buttons but don't want to go back into the previous page
[07:59:09] <Paganini> maybe I could store the value expected into a varaible and then on the next page iterate through them? any ideas?
[07:59:56] <outer_space> you can simulate a click event
[08:00:21] <fotoflo> Paganini: did you get my email?
[08:00:36] <Paganini> ooo fotoflo I haven't checked sorry I will do now! well right after this!
[08:00:43] <Paganini> thanks for the email though bro :)
[08:01:56] <Paganini> outer_space excuse my ignorance but if I simulate a click event will it not open a new page, but it will send the value through?
[08:04:34] <outer_space> not sure whats happening
[08:05:17] <outer_space> you can post forms without clicking a button, something like $('form').submit()
[08:07:26] <Paganini> what I mean is, can I submit the form without the page changing
[08:07:52] <Paganini> otherwise would I have to send through a json string and then possibly decode it
[08:07:57] <donCams> are 'success' and 'error' the only status in $.load() ?
[08:09:47] <karstenk1977_> Hello, I have a problem with xhtml markup, is here someone how can help please?
[08:09:48] <karstenk1977_> http://pastebin.com/JqxPuLzV
[08:10:25] <karstenk1977_> the problem is the existing ul before JS without any li tag
[08:11:56] <karstenk1977_> I want to place the ul together with the li in document so that there is no markup error
[08:13:57] <donCams> $('#block-popular').html(html);
[08:14:54] <donCams> or $('#block-popular').append(html);
[08:15:17] <fwaokda> anyone know how i can get jquery ui draggable to work with my android tablet?
[08:16:41] <karstenk1977_> yes this appends the li to the ul#block-popular, but if i want validate xhtml the ul may not exist
[08:17:51] <karstenk1977_> so i think i have to build the ul with JS or jQuery and jQuery('#offer-slider').append(html)
[08:18:19] <karstenk1977_> but i don´t know how to build the ul with jQuery
[08:18:49] <karstenk1977_> wrap it around the (html) and place in site
[08:21:46] <donCams> html = ''; html += return $.each(); $('.content div').html(html);
[08:21:51] <donCams> not sure though
[08:22:34] <donCams> argh. sorry
[08:24:05] <donCams> html = '<ul>'; $.each(function(){ html += ''; }); html += '</ul>'; $('.content div').html(html);
[08:24:07] <donCams> try that
[08:24:09] <NoOova> Hi all! what build of jqueryUI is on googlecode api?

[08:27:59] <karstenk1977_> but it doesn´t work
[08:28:58] <donCams> do you still have the <li> on html += inside $.each?
[08:29:26] <donCams> i mean the whole contents?
[08:30:19] <karstenk1977_> http://pastebin.com/JpNyK7u9

[08:57:25] <karstenk1977_> thanks a lot
[08:59:28] <karstenk1977_> is it normal, that the w3c validator scans my inline JS for validate html?
[09:00:44] <Camer0n> http://spareslist.com/ if you look here i've added a .change function to the search box that changes the content div, why doesnt it work??
[09:05:41] <donCams> hi, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/454208/ any idea why setInterval would become faster on its own? doncams.co.cc/imgreel_test2

[09:08:55] <Camer0n> anyone???
[09:09:33] <Zeddy> does anyone know of a wysiwyg editor that lets you add images from an array of predefined urls?
[09:25:55] <xpyman> does anyone know how to detect when a popup window has been closed ?
[09:35:00] <Topcat> click on the title contact, Why isn't the animation smooth?   http://jsfiddle.net/zmgD4/
[09:37:45] <buttersb> man, this bbq is working sorta odd
[09:42:01] <necromancer> Topcat: that shit doesn't even load for me
[09:42:50] <Topcat>  necromancer  :( well do we know of any bugs with animating positions on elements ?
[09:44:07] <necromancer> i've never had an issue with animating the positioning of an element
[09:45:39] <NickWebHA> Afternoon, all. I am coming back to JavaScript after a few years and have discovered JQuery which I am liking very much. I was wondering if it is possible if I can create custom events for when an object moves off the screen. Right now I just have a function running every second to check offsets but there must be a better way.
[09:46:18] <NickWebHA> Er, element moves off the screen.
[09:50:34] <Topcat> that's interesting.
[09:51:43] <Topcat> my animate({'left' : '0'}) would chop to about 90% of the way from 100% and then smooth animate the last 10%. animate({'left' : '0%'}) makes it play smooth the whole way.
[09:52:35] <Topcat> does jquery treat the unit differently if it's got a % or px as opposed to just the integer
[09:53:54] <buttersb> anyone have experience with the bbq plugin?
[09:56:01] <buttersb> grr, so on my sample page what I'm doing with the hashchange works perfectly fine, but in my full page it fails.
[10:17:39] <atxq> so in ie $.post and $.get do not work properly. does anyone know how to fix this issue?
[10:20:08] <adtaylor> hey, trying to get my shorthand down but pretty rusty… is there a way to write something like this ` cd.Day = d.Day || d.getDate();` without having to write something like  `cd.Day = (d.Day) ? d.Day : d.getDate();`
[10:21:08] <dabear> adtaylor: that should work, yes
[10:21:35] <dabear> allthough I've never heared of a property .Day
[10:24:35] <adtaylor> dabear: sorry, bad example… d could either be a Date object or just an object with a property Day
[10:25:14] <dabear> ?eval (new Date).Day
[10:25:15] <bot-t> dabear: undefined
[10:25:43] <dabear> but yeah, your pasted code should work
[10:25:58] <adtaylor> thanks bud
[10:34:40] <a|i> is there a plugin to support animating css 3 gradient? ie, animating on linear-gradient.
[10:37:25] <Jayflux> ajpiano you around?
[10:44:39] <karenneko> Hi.
[10:44:49] <ravenzz> hello, i have two forms on my php page, and i need to use recaptcha twice, how i should manage the inputs id to be uniques?
[10:44:52] <ravenzz> should i edit those by js?
[10:44:55] <karenneko> I'm a newbie, can we ask our questions here?
[10:45:01] <karenneko> Ah ok, guess we can :)
[10:55:57] <beakybal4> 4
[10:56:02] <beakybal4> hi
[10:56:19] <beakybal4> can you do a get function on unload?
[10:58:09] <beakybal4> http://pastie.org/2335374
[10:58:23] <beakybal4> that's my code, but the $.get event doesnt seem to be firing :/
[11:08:50] <k1t> hey folks, does anyone know how i might make this a bit prettier? http://pastie.org/2335416 it definitely seems like it could be a little shorter, just not sure how
[11:10:36] <blahblah> grr, so on my sample page what I'm doing with the hashchange works perfectly fine, but in my full page it fails.
[11:10:41] <blahblah> anyone able to help
[11:11:15] <Woet> k1t: this should workhttp://pastie.org/2335427
[11:11:17] <Woet> http://pastie.org/2335427
[11:11:56] <blahblah> that should work.
[11:12:06] <blahblah> or use e.preventDefault() , up to you
[11:12:13] <beakybal4> Woet: would you know why this wasnt working? http://pastie.org/2335374
[11:12:48] <Woet> beakybal4: because most browsers dont allow ajax calls when they quit?
[11:12:48] <xDROPx> k1t: make one function that takes 1 object to fade in, and an array of objects to fade out
[11:13:26] <beakybal4> Woet: oooo that would be why, would there be any way of sending 'n' to the php script when it quits?
[11:14:06] <Woet> beakybal4: you could send 'n' to the PHP script every few seconds and store it permanently when you haven't gotten an update for ~ 10 seconds
[11:14:27] <k1t> Woet: giving it a spin
[11:14:46] <Woet> k1t: you should add the class 'links' to the links btw
[11:15:23] <k1t> ahh not quite right for our needs
[11:15:29] <k1t> good example of usage though
[11:15:36] <zorgern> hi, i'm having big problems trying to get meta data from a js tree node in the node_selected event. anyone have any experience with jstree?
[11:15:37] <k1t> definitely cleaner - not quite right though
[11:15:39] <Woet> then what are your needs?
[11:15:46] <Woet> always useful to know :)
[11:16:08] <supyo> hey there
[11:16:11] <supyo> i ha ve a quick question
[11:16:28] <supyo> have you guys seen the new share container in techcrunch?
[11:16:30] <supyo> http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/06/the-internet-is-20-years-old-today/
[11:16:40] <supyo> the one with the twitter and the sharing buttons to the left...
[11:16:51] <supyo> do you know a method to achieve that through jquery?
[11:17:01] <supyo> i have beel lookig for a plugin but i cant seem to find any...
[11:17:09] <Woet> .. by just implementing the social media buttons as documented on their sites?
[11:17:17] <Woet> e.g. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/
[11:17:48] <supyo> no sorry, not implementing the buttons
[11:17:55] <supyo> it is more like
[11:18:03] <supyo> the floating ability of the div
[11:18:11] <supyo> it moves a little bit when it scrolls down
[11:18:16] <supyo> and the it gets fixed
[11:18:21] <supyo> and it follows you
[11:18:28] <k1t> Woet: it's for http://akta.anyehosting.com/#the-work
[11:18:31] <k1t> that slider
[11:18:47] <k1t> and you'll see the code i pasted you in the source
[11:18:50] <k1t> its just ugly man
[11:18:56] <k1t> hella bytes:(
[11:20:01] <Woet> supyo: oh, that, i've been using that on my site for quite some time
[11:20:05] <Woet> let me check which plugin i used
[11:20:12] <supyo> thxn!
[11:20:16] <supyo> thanx!
[11:20:36] <Woet> supyo: http://blog.echoenduring.com/wp-content/uploads/demos/echo_ContainedStickyScroll/
[11:20:44] <k1t> line 390 of source, is the code i showed you (in chrome) its a diff line # in FF
[11:21:41] <supyo> OMG thank you so much!
[11:21:48] <Woet> k1t: i'm getting an headache because of that site
[11:22:21] <Woet> k1t: oh, i forgot something in my code - 1 min
[11:23:21] <supyo> aight
[11:23:37] <Woet> k1t: http://pastie.org/2335484
[11:23:57] <Woet> k1t: add rel="1" on the project 1 link, rel="2" on the project 2 link, etc
[11:24:17] <Woet> k1t: and add the class "projects" to the pick-list and the projects1/projects2
[11:24:50] <supyo> Guys, im a designer, ive been in html for 10 years, so i can manage to see code and implement it
[11:24:53] <supyo> my question is
[11:25:15] <supyo> do you think a designer CAN LEARN jquery and use it? i mean... is it that hard if you're no programmer?
[11:25:20] <k1t> Woet: ah, now that sounds like it'll work out.. pluggin' in the code
[11:25:34] <Woet> k1t: i was typing the code, then helped supyo and forgot i wasn't done yet :P
[11:25:55] <supyo> Woet :P
[11:25:58] <k1t> ha, no worries [;
[11:28:39] <k1t> Woet: seems to work good, but it makes the pick-list disabled after you click from the drop down
[11:28:55] <k1t> posted it to http://akta.anyehosting.com/#the-work
[11:29:20] <Woet> k1t: you added 'projects' to the links
[11:29:42] <Woet> k1t: <ul class="pick-list"> to <ul class="pick-list projects">
[11:29:53] <Woet> k1t: <li><a href="#" class="proj1 links projects" rel="1"> to <li><a href="#" class="proj1 links" rel="1">
[11:30:07] <Woet> :p
[11:31:04] <k1t> Woet: gettin' closer.. pick-list is not getting hidden
[11:31:20] <k1t> it's updated on the site
[11:31:31] <k1t> (uploaded)
[11:31:35] <Woet> [20:29:41] <Woet> k1t: <ul class="pick-list"> to <ul class="pick-list projects">
[11:31:59] <k1t> ahhh
[11:32:10] <k1t> Woet: we're golden man!
[11:32:15] <k1t> works great - sorry i missed that
[11:32:20] <Woet> :)
[11:32:38] <Woet> and now there is room for unlimited projects without a book full of javascript
[11:33:36] <k1t> you're awesome, mucho gracias
[11:42:33] <blahblah> i swear, this ui-menu is going to be the end of me
[11:47:14] <BlaDe__> Hi, when I put this in my header it works.. but it blocks, if I put it in my footer it doesn't - but no errors
[11:47:19] <BlaDe__> any ideas? http://pastie.org/private/6t0qtodgwflkwz57ojdg
[11:53:57] <blahblah> anyone around?
[11:54:20] <VeXii> sup?
[11:54:58] <SuperID>  I'm using a very standard $('#droppable').droppable({drop: function(){$('#droppable').effect("shake");});
[11:54:58] <SuperID> Is there a shortcut so I don't have to re-select $('#droppable') when I apply the "shake"?  I know that this.("shake"); does not work.
[11:55:27] <blahblah> wait, explain that again?
[11:55:35] <cohitre> SuperID:  $(this).effect("shake")
[11:55:44] <SuperID> ahhhhh!
[11:55:58] <SuperID> duh, thx :)
[11:57:09] <OKONKWO> Hey guys, I'm having a problem with the ocupload plugin for jquery (one click upload, uses an embedded iframe to upload an image without a page refresh)
[11:57:10] <blahblah> im totally stumped with this ui-menu , any chance you could help cohitre
[11:57:28] <cohitre> ? ask @ blahblah
[11:57:29] <bot-t> blahblah, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:57:32] <OKONKWO> Can someone lend me a hand? I can paste my code into pastebin
[11:57:43] <OKONKWO> I've been working at this for a few hours now
[11:58:13] <blahblah> I cannot get the bbq plugin hashchange event to work in my page, but in test page i did, it works fine. no issues.
[11:59:08] <blahblah> however, triggering the hashchange with the jquery-ui-menu isn't working
[11:59:15] <blahblah> pushState doesn't seem to fire correctly.
[11:59:45] <OKONKWO> http://pastebin.com/jX16FGvc
[12:01:11] <OKONKWO> Sorry if I'm not following IRC etiquette i'm relatively new to using this as a help source. I was asking this question on Stack Overflow earlier without much luck: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6973661/jquery-javascript-scope-question-function-not-working-correctly-inside-document
[12:03:15] <cohitre> OKONKWO: line 29
[12:03:46] <cohitre> replace "MyProfileImg.prototype.crop_object" for "this.crop_object"
[12:04:26] <cohitre> never mind, i wasn't understanding what you were trying to do
[12:06:34] <OKONKWO> yeah sorry i might have pasted a version of the code that contained stuff i was in the middle of trying
[12:06:47] <OKONKWO> but what i couldn't understand was I would run the command from the command line
[12:06:50] <OKONKWO> and it would work
[12:06:59] <OKONKWO> but not directly from my code
[12:07:07] <OKONKWO> i documented this a bit better in my SO question
[12:07:23] <OKONKWO> thank you for looking at it
[12:11:38] <OKONKWO> what i can't understand is why the plugin behaves as expected if i try to initiate it twice from the command line
[12:11:48] <Bounty> Hello
[12:12:21] <Bounty> Is there anyone who can halp me with jQuery problem?
[12:12:34] <soulcutter> No, there is nobody that can help you
[12:12:47] <blahblah> just ask Bounty
[12:13:17] <Bounty> I instaled jQuery "lavalamp" navigation bar on my smf forum
[12:13:28] <Bounty> but it doesnot work as expected
[12:14:09] <Bounty> do you have experience in that?
[12:14:19] <soulcutter> that's not a very good description of a problem
[12:14:41] <blahblah> explain what is or is NOT occurring, for starters.
[12:14:58] <blahblah> in my jquery-ui-menu when I log out the select event, it fires twice for everything.
[12:15:19] <Bounty> well...nav bar works but when i click on any of buttons it just stays on original page it wont switch pages
[12:15:21] <blahblah> i have event.stopPropogation() and return false in the closure, so I'm not sure why it's happening
[12:15:27] <OKONKWO> no one knows what's going on with my ocupload problem?
[12:15:39] <blahblah> do you have firebug or somethign? or a link to the page?
[12:15:47] <Bounty> i got firebug
[12:15:55] <Bounty> but forum is atm on localhost
[12:16:16] <Bounty> until i fix that..
[12:16:36] <soulcutter> Bounty: maybe you can create a test cast on jsFiddle?
[12:16:53] <blahblah> or look what error is appearing in console in firebug when you select something
[12:18:00] <Bounty> i dont know how to set up a page of forum on jsfiddle
[12:18:05] <Bounty> but i will check for errors
[12:21:25] <Bounty> umm no errors
[12:21:42] <blahblah> http://pastie.org/2335715 : why is the select event in page.create_category_menu() fire on load
[12:21:53] <blahblah> it shouldn't trigger, it should just create a handler.
[12:22:29] <blahblah> do a few console.log() at differnt points to see what's happening
[12:22:41] <asadpakistani> if i add two jquery core scripts to one page, will the second one override the first one...and how unefficient would this process be? i have to do this because of a bug in my framework.
[12:23:10] <blahblah> there has to be a way to circumvent the problem without dbl loading..
[12:23:16] <blahblah> and all you can do is try..
[12:29:56] <Bounty1> blahblah
[12:30:16] <Bounty1> this is the script im using

[12:35:14] <grid_> heya
[12:35:39] <grid_> i tried to use $("#player").css({height:153}); would it have to work?
[12:40:13] <grid_> i want to change my div height to a fixed height (without animation)
[12:41:20] <blahblah> then do a $('div.selector').outerHeight(500); or something
[12:44:08] <grid_> blahblah: does it require to reload the div?
[12:47:36] <grid_> blahblah: the line i have given above works anyways
[12:49:33] <sandy123> hello
[12:54:05] <blahblah> hi
[13:08:19] <Acorn> I see there's an text selection event, is there a way to just get the currently selected text?
[13:20:44] <thebignoise> Hi. I feel like I should know this but I dont. How do i change the val of an element based on its class
[13:20:50] <thebignoise> ive tried hasClass()
[13:20:57] <thebignoise> but to no avail
[13:21:45] <thebignoise> im looping through a bunch of elements and trying to find the one with the right id, which is there class
[13:23:15] <thebignoise> im an idiot NVM
[13:25:25] <thebignoise> is there a way to get the pages position
[13:25:45] <thebignoise> or have the page not move when using an ajax request
[13:27:09] <ckb> okay, with event delegation, how can I see what element triggered the event (submit on a form, in this case)
[13:32:20] <Engin> I get .dblclick and e.preventDefault() and even e.stopImmediatePropagation(), yet, I still see element selection marking (i.e. marking stuff with blue background)... is there no way t o prevent it ?

[13:53:43] <k1t> proally make the if's on liners
[13:53:45] <k1t> one liners*

[13:55:12] <Toumal> Good evening
[13:56:58] <Toumal> I have a really really strange problem and I'm biting my nails by now... may I bother someone for a bit of help?
[13:59:36] <Jayflux> Toumal just ask away im sure someone here can help you
[14:01:22] <Toumal> Alrighty, here goes: I've made a little yii widget for jquery elastic, the dynamically resizing textbox jquery plugin. Works fine on most pages, but sometimes I get a "jQuery("#sfCommentReplyTextarea").elastic is not a function" error. Now, this doesn't seem to be a problem with the plugin since I get this with other jquery stuff as well. But it's only on some pages and I cannot pinpoint why.
[14:01:35] <NielsMob> hello all, just a short question, how do i tell jqueryui which language to use?
[14:02:56] <Toumal> I've got both jquery.min.js and the jquery.elastic.js included on all pages and yet it works on some and doesn't on others.
[14:05:25] <Toumal> I've also checked that the text input has the right id and I'm calling $("#textinputid").elastic() at domready. Also tried onload etc. - exact same behavior.
[14:05:46] <Toumal> There's no other plugin or js code using that function name either.
[14:06:45] <Toumal> So I guess my question is: When a jquery plugin uses such a way of working with html entities, what can make this problem occur?
[14:06:59] <NielsMob> Toumal: did you try to run it with firebug on firefox?
[14:08:22] <Toumal> NielsMob: Yes of course. And when I put jQuery("#sfCommentReplyTextarea").elastic();  as the watch expression, elastic() is undefined.
[14:08:43] <Toumal> NielsMob: However on another page I do jQuery("#PrivateMessage_message").elastic() 	 and that works!
[14:08:57] <Toumal> On both pages I have jquery and jquery.elastic.js included
[14:10:35] <NielsMob> they also loaded in the same sequence i presume.. i found out myself that putting them in the wrong way it does not work ;)
[14:12:36] <Toumal> NielsMob: Heh yeah...  Here's the js includes of the page where it doesn't work: http://pastebin.com/nCpp0WSn
[14:13:27] <Toumal> NielsMob: While this one works: http://pastebin.com/dLazD6aR
[14:15:24] <NielsMob> one suggestion just remove every js until it works.
[14:23:17] <Toumal> NielsMob: *nods* Other than that, do you have any thoughts on what could cause that function to not be defined anymore?
[14:23:58] <NielsMob> are both files in the same folder as well?
[14:24:35] <Toumal> NielsMob: I found that one of the JS files included causes the problem to appear. It uses a javascript inheritance script from http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
[14:25:00] <Toumal> My guess is that it's that inheritance hack that breaks stuff, but I don't see how..
[14:26:17] <NielsMob> i have no clue anymore.
[14:27:15] <timz> Heya, does anybody have experience with (un)delegating namespaced events (since 1.6) ?
[14:27:16] <Toumal> NielsMob: Hmm.. but thanks regardless.
[14:30:23] <rubberducky> hey all, quick question from a novice i have the following setup:
[14:31:07] <rubberducky> index.php has an ajax search script that returns 3 links depending on what you search for, all the links have a class that i want the jquery in the original page to work on
[14:31:39] <rubberducky> because they are not loaded till after the jquery code, will it not work? it doesn't seem to be working (all it should do is hide the div they are in after one is clicked)
[14:33:46] <pouledodue> Is there a push technology that works with every browser? I read about websockets but doesn't seem to be supported everywhere...
[14:35:56] <timz> rubberducky: use $('.selector').live() instead of .click()
[14:36:11] <timz> pouledodue: no
[14:37:19] <Toumal> pouledodue: Did you take a look at EventSource? https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery.eventsource/wiki
[14:38:04] <Toumal> pouledodue: That plugin falls back to regular Ajax if the browser doesn't support the EventSource API.
[14:38:46] <pouledodue> Toumal: thx
[14:40:44] <Toumal> pouledodue: yw.

[18:18:39] <k1t> what method would i use to make an element go from it's original height to a larger height
[18:18:45] <k1t> would slideUp/slideDown work for that?
[18:19:06] <k1t> it seems to me those are for like completely hidden elements you want to show
[18:21:24] <sshaginyan> Can someone please please tell me why my form dosen't work with ie 7 or 8
[18:21:27] <sshaginyan> http://www.bunchlink.com/enw/
[18:24:01] <sshaginyan> k1t: I assume You would initially get the height then use an "offset" variable or function
[18:24:16] <k1t> sshaginyan: i think i need animate() actualy

[18:38:07] <mattersen> Hi guys, wondering if someone has used the jquery waypoints..it doesn't seems to be very precise..otherwise, is someone knows any alternative? cheers
[18:38:21] <mattersen> jquery plugin waypoints sorry
[18:38:55] <mattersen> I am looking for make elements appears or disappears depending on where the user is in the page
[18:50:37] <imsky> mattersen: what problem are you having?
[18:54:44] <mattersen> Hi imsky, I am using the plugin Waypoint.js to execute action depending the Dom element I am scrolling to. For example if I am scrolling to an a div with the ID 'page2', I make a new div appearing at the top, but I scroll up to an other div Id, I want this element disapear. the thing it that it works on certain id but not all of them...I don't know if my problem is clear..
[18:55:46] <mattersen> Imsky, to illustrate what I want to do, this website is a good example : http://benthebodyguard.com/
[18:56:37] <imsky> mattersen: what do you have so far?
[18:59:31] <mattersen> imsky :so far I have a function like that : http://jsfiddle.net/6KYzH/1/
[19:00:36] <mattersen> Imsky: when I lauch the page in the browser, it scroll down and execute the code when direction is down, but also do the direction up too...which is weird..
[19:01:11] <imsky> yeah i'm not exactly sure how they calculate direction
[19:01:16] <imsky> that's an interesting one
[19:01:41] <mattersen> imsky: If I put some alert in the condition, it doing down, then up...but the scroll direction in a browser is just going down when I load the page
[19:02:19] <imsky> yep i see
[19:02:37] <mattersen> imsky, that is why I was thinking if there is any other alternative, ways or plugin to do this.
[19:02:45] <imsky> you could code it yourself
[19:02:50] <imsky> waypoints is too much magic
[19:03:39] <mattersen> do you have any tips to code it ...?
[19:04:02] <imsky> hmm let me see
[19:04:38] <KineticColor> How can I make this page: http://kineticcolor.com/tfm/index.html reload every 15 minutes when it is not the active tab?
[19:05:06] <imsky> KineticColor: with a firefox addon
[19:05:43] <KineticColor> @imsky I am trying to do it with Jquery
[19:05:46] <imsky> mattersen: the principle of it is pretty simple, i suppose
[19:05:53] <imsky> KineticColor: in that case, ?dotimeout
[19:05:57] <KineticColor> @imsky hence the channel name
[19:06:08] <imsky> ?dotimeout @ KineticColor
[19:06:08] <bot-t> KineticColor, doTimeout, a jQuery plugin that takes the work out of delayed code execution, including interval and timeout management, polling loops and debouncing. In addition, it’s fully jQuery chainable - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[19:06:25] <imsky> mattersen: do you see any errors in console?
[19:08:31] <KineticColor> imsky: How does this accomplish my goal?
[19:08:46] <imsky> KineticColor: set a timeout and refresh the page as the function
[19:09:19] <KineticColor> imsky: How will it now the page is not open?
[19:09:32] <KineticColor> err not the active tab
[19:09:33] <imsky> good question, that's part of html5
[19:09:36] <KineticColor> ...
[19:09:41] <imsky> so i guess if your browser doesn't support it
[19:09:43] <imsky> you're screwed
[19:10:03] <KineticColor> I am sure it can be detected with JQ
[19:10:09] <imsky> are you now
[19:10:23] <mattersen> imsky, no errors
[19:10:33] <imsky> KineticColor: http://www.igvita.com/2011/06/25/html5-visibility-api-page-pre-rendering/
[19:10:41] <imsky> mattersen: ok, do you want to send me the zip of your site?
[19:11:36] <imsky> KineticColor: https://github.com/addyosmani/visibly.js is a polyfill that can help you out
[19:11:51] <ajpiano> KineticColor you can use the focus and blur events on the window, coupled with see ?idleTimer
[19:11:52] <bot-t> ajpiano, idleTimer | jQuery Plugins - There are a few cases where you want to know if the user is idle. Namely: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/idleTimer
[19:12:08] <ajpiano> or that
[19:12:08] <KineticColor> Ahh this is way over my head lol
[19:12:16] <imsky> yeap
[19:12:38] <mattersen> imsky, I am going to prepare an html light version of the site for you as it is a big site
[19:12:43] <KineticColor> Will trade interface art for code haha
[19:12:45] <imsky> no prob
[19:12:55] <imsky> KineticColor: will trade code for $
[19:13:09] <KineticColor> How much money?
[19:13:25] <imsky> depends, what are you trying to build?
[19:13:37] <KineticColor> Private chat ok?
[19:13:40] <imsky> yeah sure

[19:25:51] <rawfodog> Is jquery a useful tool for web development ? What exactly are the benefits ?
[19:26:07] <imsky> mattersen: yes, it's fairly simple, have you looked at the jquery docs?
[19:26:17] <imsky> rawfodog: it's useful for UI
[19:26:35] <rawfodog> Everyone keeps talking about it, I was thinking of diving into HTML5, but maybe I should look at jquery first ?
[19:26:46] <imsky> dive into javascript first
[19:26:52] <imsky> jquery is just a javascript library

[19:28:46] <rawfodog> I got a basic idea of how javascript works, not really intense, but I can xss and stuff :P
[19:29:16] <coldhead> js is SO intense
[19:29:55] <coldhead> assigning a function to a variable is about as close to a heart attack as i ever want to feel
[19:30:27] <coldhead> and returning functions from functions is too much
[19:30:37] <imsky> js gives me multiple heart attacks
[19:30:38] <coldhead> it can make you puke

[19:58:38] <Spadeski> Hello everyone
[20:33:17] <clu3> hello all, how do i remove the last 2 items from $('li') ?
[21:23:28] <justicefries> clu3: how would you do it conceptually?
[21:25:04] <clu3> justicefries, you mean i should do a loop ?
[21:25:24] <justicefries> no, I'm asking you to talk through the problem first.
[21:25:28] <justicefries> and talk me through it.
[21:25:54] <justicefries> what does $('li') give you, an array, right?
[21:26:06] <clu3> yes
[21:26:17] <justicefries> how would you get the last two elements of that array?
[21:27:16] <clu3> ok, so it's normal array operation
[21:27:26] <clu3> ?
[21:27:39] <chjj> jquery objects are array-like, pretty sure they have .pop
[21:27:56] <clu3> okay
[21:28:20] <justicefries> also check out .splice
[21:28:39] <justicefries> $('li').splice($('li').length-2) - don't do this exactly obviously

[21:55:54] <webbe> Can someone please help me? I'm using a BG of an animated gif for the slider, but its not showing on page load.
[21:56:07] <webbe> url is - http://jurbank.com/lightning-grader/
[21:58:54] <vladikoff> webbe, css issue probably : http://gyazo.com/180040f59e9635ef27928a5a6ba11437
[22:01:33] <Iarfen> hi
[22:01:43] <webbe> hmm.. not showing crossed out in the chrome inspector
[22:01:43] <Iarfen> How i can disable, but not hide, elements of a page?
[22:02:05] <webbe> i see it showing crossed in ff tho, thanks form the catch!
[22:19:28] <seancurtis> ok need some clarification: does the html5shiv js file need to be before the CSS files? Noticing 2 different opinions.
[22:25:50] <allan_> can any one help me a way to validate two times(start time and end time) using jquery validation,i need to get it validated while the form is submitted,the end time should always be greater than start time
[22:26:31] <seancurtis> you want to validate that end is after the start?
[22:26:45] <allan_> yes
[22:27:52] <seancurtis> are they typing the dates in or using a picker?
[22:27:54] <allan_> i code the following code after googling but unfortunately it didn't work for me
[22:27:55] <allan_> jQuery.validator.addMethod("greaterThan", function(value, element, params) {
[22:27:56] <allan_>         if (!/Invalid|NaN/.test(new Date(value))) {
[22:27:56] <allan_>             return new Date(value) > new Date($(params).val());
[22:27:56] <allan_>         }
[22:27:56] <allan_>         return isNaN(value) && isNaN($(params).val()) || (parseFloat(value) > parseFloat($(params).val()));
[22:27:58] <allan_>     },'Must be greater than {0}.');
[22:28:17] <seancurtis> you need to parse the date, flatten it to a time (seconds since some date around 1970) and make sure one is bigger than the other
[22:28:30] <seancurtis> allan_: no pasting code in the chan - use a pastie
[22:28:35] <seancurtis> ?pastie @ allan_
[22:28:35] <bot-t> allan_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:29:07] <allan_> sorry will pate the code in pastie in future
[22:29:11] <allan_> *paste
[22:29:43] <rhino> how can I get the value of a specific checkbox when clicking on a submit button?  here is my fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/qkA4j/2/
[22:29:53] <seancurtis> yeah not sure on the exact code - looks like you're sort of on the right track though
[22:30:01] <allan_> can i get it parsed using Date method
[22:30:18] <seancurtis> not sure - I haven't done much with Dates
[22:30:50] <seancurtis> rhino: unrelated comment - use labels instead of spans
[22:31:07] <seancurtis> <label for="fid_">Amazing.mp3</label>
[22:31:08] <allan_> okay..how can i write a rule for that then?
[22:31:23] <seancurtis> allan_: sorry - I'm the wrong person to ask :(
[22:32:17] <rhino> seancurtis:  will update that right now, anideas on getting the value of the checkbox when clicking on the submit btn?
[22:32:20] <seancurtis> rhino: also you have duplicate IDs on your checkboxes
[22:33:25] <seancurtis> rhino: what do you want the delete button to do?
[22:33:34] <allan_> can anyone help to write a rule in jquery validation inorder to compare two different times
[22:34:43] <allan_>  can anyone help me to write a rule in jquery validation inorder to compare two different times
[22:35:20] <rhino> I want to be able to get the value of the checkbox when the submit button is clicked:  I have also updated the fiddle to incorporate you suggestions  http://jsfiddle.net/qkA4j/3/
[22:35:35] <seancurtis> rhino: after you have the checked one what are you doing?
[22:35:41] <seancurtis> do you just want to delete that row?
[22:36:29] <rhino> seancurtis:  exactly, I am going to use an ajax to delete from my db an then refresh the page
[22:36:43] <seancurtis> rhino: probably not good having so many input type submits - do you have a wrapping form which handles the actions?
[22:36:49] <seancurtis> you have lots of duplicate IDs on elements
[22:36:59] <allan_> can anyone help me to write a rule in jquery validation inorder to compare two different times
[22:37:32] <seancurtis> rhino: check out this: cleaned up your markup and stuff a bit: http://jsfiddle.net/qkA4j/4/
[22:37:41] <seancurtis> there's a comment in the code for your ajax call
[22:39:13] <rhino> seancurtis:  but I need to be able to grab the value from the checkbox onclick in order to do my ajax submit.  That is what I am having trouble with
[22:39:22] <allan_> how to write a custom method in jquery validation and how it works?
[22:39:42] <rhino> seancurtis:  any ideas on how to do that?
[22:39:45] <seancurtis> rhino: oops - hang on
[22:39:54] <rhino> k
[22:40:16] <allan_> how to write a custom method in jquery validation and how it works?
[22:40:37] <seancurtis> rhino: so if they press delete without the checkbox checked - what happens then?
[22:40:47] <seancurtis> if you want to have the checkboxes then only have one delete button down the bottom
[22:41:00] <seancurtis> if you want to have one delete button per item then there's no point checking the checkbox state
[22:41:26] <seancurtis> it'd be insinuated that clicking the delete button for that row would assume that they want to remove it - no point making them check the checkbox then hit the button
[22:42:01] <seancurtis> rhino: so which do you want - one button or many?
[22:44:06] <rhino> seancurtis:  I want to grab the value for the checkbox with the submit btn. in the div, so i guess multiple btns
[22:44:22] <rhino> 1 btn per div
[22:45:15] <rhino> seancurtis:  does that make sense?
[22:46:29] <seancurtis> ok - so what we should do is ignore the checkbox value - put the same value on the button - like this: http://jsfiddle.net/qkA4j/6/
[22:46:46] <seancurtis> so print the val on the button as well as the checkbox - easy peasy
[22:48:18] <rhino> seancurtis:  tnx
[22:48:40] <seancurtis> rhino: nps
[22:48:44] <webbe> This is not a jQuery question, but can anyone help me find a solution I am having with the top nav in ie7? http://jurbank.com/lightning-grader/
[22:50:13] <seancurtis> webbe: what's the problem?
[22:52:47] <webbe> the top fixed nav is supposed fixed and centered
[22:52:56] <webbe> It is not in ie, it floats right
[22:53:02] <mib_mib> hi, how can i 'zoom' in on html? For instance, if i click control + in my browser, it scales everything nicely - i'd like to do that with jquery
[22:53:03] <webbe> ie7*
[22:54:16] <vladikoff> webbe, looks the same http://gyazo.com/2772c83e1fefd2dccd9225a18dc4d4b0
[22:55:28] <webbe> but it floats left in ie7 not in other browsers
[22:55:29] <seancurtis> webbe: you're using position: fixed - give the header left: 0; top: 0;
[22:55:56] <webbe> I will give it a go!
[22:56:30] <seancurtis> mib_mib: use an em-based layout and then use JS to increase the base value
[22:56:44] <seancurtis> but that'll only do some things
[22:57:00] <seancurtis> unless you want to apply em-based height/width vals to all your images
[22:57:07] <seancurtis> not easy to do
[22:57:15] <mib_mib> seancurtis: how does the browser do it?
[22:57:28] <mib_mib> seancurtis: there has to be some sort of plugin to do it
[22:57:41] <seancurtis> the browsers used to scale the base font sizez
[22:57:43] <seancurtis> size
[22:58:02] <webbe> seancurtis thanks!
[22:58:14] <mib_mib> but the layout is maintained as well, proportionally
[22:58:20] <webbe> I didn't think it would be that simple :)
[22:58:31] <seancurtis> which is why people didn't use pixel based font sizes - because IE6 didn't zoom - it scaled the text - browsers have in-app zooming of what they render - much easier for them to just increase pixels
[22:58:33] <vladikoff> seancurtis in da hauz!
[22:58:39] <seancurtis> webbe: :D
[22:58:46] <seancurtis> vladikoff: #winning
[22:59:07] <seancurtis> vladikoff: doing my little bit to keep this channel awesome :)
[22:59:18] <vladikoff> seancurtis, it is truly an awesome channel
[22:59:20] <webbe> so you can also move the element using x, y with fixed?
[22:59:34] <seancurtis> webbe: pos fixed essentially takes it out of the flow
[22:59:47] <seancurtis> you could go top:0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; if you want :)
[22:59:55] <seancurtis> webbe: do you really want a fixed header?
[23:00:01] <seancurtis> ie. content will scroll under it
[23:00:27] <webbe> client wants it to be fixed :)
[23:00:53] <seancurtis> webbe: fair enuff - they don't care about IE6 then?
[23:01:44] <webbe> not at the moment
[23:02:47] <seancurtis> yay
