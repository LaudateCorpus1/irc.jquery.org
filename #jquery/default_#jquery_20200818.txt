[00:00:02] <robertmaxrees> you need to remove all those IDs first :)
[00:01:27] <robertmaxrees> your next problem is you're assuming that the issue is $('table').last() baruna
[00:01:57] <robertmaxrees> baruna re-read the description for https://api.jquery.com/html/ - what does it say?
[00:04:29] <baruna> wel...get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements
[00:04:34] <robertmaxrees> right.
[00:04:46] <robertmaxrees> so click the plus button and inspect the page.  what do you get?
[00:06:53] <robertmaxrees> baruna
[00:06:57] <baruna> robertmaxrees: what do you mean? there's ==$0 after the button code
[00:07:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[00:07:28] <robertmaxrees> did you click that plus and inspect the page?
[00:07:47] <baruna> yes in the Elements tab
[00:07:51] <robertmaxrees> and what do you see?
[00:08:35] <baruna> you mean Issues detected?
[00:08:38] <robertmaxrees> no.
[00:08:42] <robertmaxrees> in the element inspector.
[00:08:43] <robertmaxrees> the DOM.
[00:08:59] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/U6LyI4M.png
[00:09:04] <robertmaxrees> see anything weird with that?
[00:10:13] <baruna> ah. the thing is I already removed all the IDs as you told me
[00:10:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[00:10:27] <robertmaxrees> you're looking at the wrong thing now.
[00:10:38] <robertmaxrees> notice how you have a <table> and then a series of <tbody> elements after it?
[00:11:23] <baruna> well yes now I see it
[00:11:40] <robertmaxrees> and you get a new tbody for every time you click that plus?  so go back to the description of .html() :)
[00:11:43] <robertmaxrees> see the issue now?
[00:12:35] <baruna> yes I understand there's only one <table> so the new ones must be added after the first one
[00:12:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[00:13:05] <robertmaxrees> .html() is grabbing the contents of $('table').last()
[00:13:11] <robertmaxrees> not the wrapping table element.
[00:13:56] <baruna> is there a way how to get the contents of <table> as well?
[00:14:05] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[00:14:19] <robertmaxrees> you ARE getting the contents of <table>, just not the wrapping table element.
[00:14:31] <robertmaxrees> that's the bug.
[00:15:00] <baruna> yeah now I understand. Just want to figure out how to get the wrapping table element as well
[00:15:11] <robertmaxrees> there's a smarter way to do this.
[00:15:46] <baruna> or I could use $('tbody').last() probably
[00:15:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[00:15:53] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible idea.
[00:16:01] <robertmaxrees> because you're going to have the exact same issue :)
[00:16:05] <robertmaxrees> so first.
[00:16:16] <robertmaxrees> can you change the HTML of the table at all?
[00:16:59] <baruna> robertmaxrees: what do you mean? obviously I can use str.replace ()
[00:17:10] <robertmaxrees> not what i mean.
[00:17:16] <robertmaxrees> the actual html of that first table.
[00:17:21] <robertmaxrees> the one you removed the IDs from.
[00:17:40] <baruna> I don't know
[00:17:43] <robertmaxrees> ...
[00:17:48] <robertmaxrees> i thought you said you removed the IDs?
[00:18:21] <baruna> oh I thought you asked me if I can change the html dynamically via jquery
[00:18:28] <robertmaxrees> no.
[00:18:47] <robertmaxrees> i mean of the original markup for the first table.  not using jquery.
[00:18:57] <baruna> robertmaxrees: sure, I can do anything
[00:19:20] <robertmaxrees> cool - so i'd wrap that table count number in a span and give it a class like "table-count"
[00:19:48] <baruna> robertmaxrees: ok
[00:20:06] <robertmaxrees> next - instead of using .html(), use .clone() and grab the table that way.
[00:21:16] <baruna> robertmaxrees: thanks!!!
[00:21:18] <robertmaxrees> then you'll change how you update the number.
[00:21:30] <robertmaxrees> don't string replace to do it.
[00:21:40] <robertmaxrees> you can juse do table.find('.table-count').text(cislo_vyznamu); instead.
[00:22:20] <baruna> yeah good idea
[00:22:52] <robertmaxrees> using regex for stuff like this quickly gets out of hand.
[00:22:59] <robertmaxrees> oh and make sure you're using semicolons :)
[00:24:06] <baruna> ok :)
[00:29:03] <baruna> robertmaxrees: one more question. Is there a similar way how to dynamically set input and textarea names? using the span class="table-cound"
[00:29:51] <robertmaxrees> you could do something similar, sure.
[00:29:59] <robertmaxrees> though i'd question why you'd need it haha.
[00:30:05] <baruna> robertmaxrees: ah yes it's actually very easy
[00:30:17] <baruna> robertmaxrees: it's for form purposes
[00:30:19] <robertmaxrees> are you submitting these via ajax?
[00:30:26] <robertmaxrees> or via a normal form post?
[00:30:35] <baruna> robertmaxrees: not via ajax but via form post, yes
[00:30:41] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[00:30:46] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, it's doable.
[00:31:09] <baruna> robertmaxrees: yeah I shouldn't have asked, it's actually very easy
[00:31:15] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :)
[00:31:37] <baruna> anyway thank you really very much!!! I woulnd't have figured out this myself
[00:32:20] <robertmaxrees> absolutely!
[10:51:57] <jak2000> hi all, i have a string: "ASDAS23423423.343"  (valid)  "ASDA#@$@322.78"  (invalid) i want only accept A..Z and a..z an 0..9 and the point any regexp?
[12:37:30] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that's a javascript question :)
[19:56:36] <znf> Hi.
[19:56:45] <znf> I'm very confused about the scope of variables
[19:56:58] <robertmaxrees> go on.
[19:57:14] <znf> I'm defining a variable in $(document).ready() { var stuff = doOtherStuff; }
[19:57:34] <znf> and I have a function outside of this, like function doStuff() { stuff.DoMoreStuff }
[19:57:46] <znf> but doStuff() fails
[19:57:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/94awfjrm/
[19:57:57] <robertmaxrees> make this look closer to what you have.
[19:57:57] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:58:59] <znf> think this covers it: https://jsfiddle.net/Lx7eugyt/
[19:59:31] <robertmaxrees> so... which var?
[19:59:38] <znf> chart
[19:59:53] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[19:59:59] <robertmaxrees> so let's simplify.
[20:00:29] <robertmaxrees> when you use the 'var' keyword, you're scoping that variable to whatever function youre in.
[20:01:32] <robertmaxrees> so https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7ow5j6ab/
[20:01:43] <znf> yup
[20:02:17] <znf> oops, sorry, I just realized I pasted an incomplete example
[20:02:37] <znf> after chart.render(); -- I was meaning to do pie_is_popping(371790);
[20:02:53] <znf> which is complaining about: users.php:1574 Uncaught ReferenceError: chart is not defined
[20:02:53] <znf>     at Object.success (users.php:1574)
[20:02:59] <znf> but you already figured that :P
[20:03:00] <robertmaxrees> right - because it isn't.
[20:03:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:03:07] <robertmaxrees> chart only exists in that click handler.
[20:03:40] <znf> but my chart gets created only when the modal is showing up - should I just do window.chart ?
[20:03:44] <znf> or is that something stupid?
[20:04:12] <robertmaxrees> without understanding more about what you're building i have no clue what to suggest.
[20:04:20] <robertmaxrees> i will say that global vars like that are a really, really bad idea.
[20:04:37] <robertmaxrees> is there a reason you have to create the chart inside that handler?
[20:05:03] <znf> I'm creating it/destroying it on user-click on a button
[20:05:42] <znf> I have a list of users, each with a button for "activity charts", when the button is pressed, a modal is created, it's data-userid="" is used to ajax fetch the data
[20:06:03] <znf> I'm expecting the user to check multiple "activity charts" for more than 1 user without a page reload
[20:06:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, without seeing it in action it's hard to know what to suggest.
[20:06:59] <znf> so I figured I'd define the chart - render it, initialize with data - every time a new user's "activity charts" button is pressed
[20:07:10] <robertmaxrees> can you only show one chart at a time?
[20:07:16] <znf> then when the modal is closed, the chart is chart.destroy()'d
[20:07:23] <robertmaxrees> oh, don't do that.
[20:07:37] <znf> oh?
[20:07:42] <robertmaxrees> looks like apex has options for you to render with whatever new data when you need: x fetch
[20:07:47] <robertmaxrees> * https://apexcharts.com/docs/methods/
[20:08:01] <robertmaxrees> so init once on pageload, then re-render as needed.
[20:08:08] <znf> I tested that, and it sometimes didn't re-render the chart properly
[20:08:28] <znf> ie: previous user chart had 6 data-points, new one had 4, some... strangeness ensued
[20:08:39] <robertmaxrees> clarify
[20:08:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:09:02] <znf> in my tests, the +2 data points didn't vanish, for some reasons?
[20:09:10] <znf> well, "series" as Apex calls them
[20:09:21] <znf> I'm not sure if I did something wrong in my tests
[20:09:41] <robertmaxrees> they look like they have methods that handle all of that for youy.
[20:09:44] <robertmaxrees> *you
[20:10:30] <znf> *but* even if that's not the case, the pie-chart via ApexChart is only half the data I want/need, I'll also need to change/update a table with user info
[20:10:42] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[20:10:46] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do witht he chart?
[20:10:57] <znf> dunno, was thinking to just destroy everything to be safe?
[20:10:57] <znf> :)
[20:11:19] <robertmaxrees> sure, except that we just showed that won't work :)
[20:11:20] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:12:34] <znf> so... should I just define my pie_is_popping and chart.render() inside the $(document).ready(function() {}); ?
[20:13:06] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to fix the bug on its own.
[20:13:48] <znf> how come? if var = chart() is defined inside ready() shouldn't it be accesible to other functions created at the same level?
[20:14:01] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:14:04] <znf> oh
[20:14:14] <robertmaxrees> because chart is declared in an event handler.
[20:14:16] <robertmaxrees> which is a function.
[20:14:39] <znf> I mean, declaring chart in .ready() and not in the event
[20:14:58] <znf> and the pie_is_popping() function there, too inside .ready()
[20:15:20] <robertmaxrees> without knowing how those other methods are getting called, etc, it's hard for me to really suggest anything :/
[20:15:37] <znf> I'll give it a spin
[20:15:41] <robertmaxrees> :(
[20:18:28] <znf> Yeah, this seems to work: https://pastie.dev/ZqJuFx.js
[20:19:05] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah - sorry, thought you were just gonna var chart; and then move on from there lol.
[20:19:17] <znf> no, inside
[20:19:19] <znf> all good
[20:19:34] <znf> wonder if I should move pie_options inside the .ready(), but it seems to work without that, too
[20:19:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:20:07] <robertmaxrees> it already IS in the ready, per that paste.
[20:20:10] <znf> I have another pie_options var where I define my chart
[20:20:24] <robertmaxrees> oh - it'll need to be in there, yeah.
[20:20:28] <robertmaxrees> won't exist otherwise
[20:20:35] <robertmaxrees> the chart var, i mean
[20:20:35] <znf> I meant this: https://i.imgur.com/BNA5Dzc.png
[20:21:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:21:10] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[20:21:13] <robertmaxrees> no need, tbh.
[20:21:18] <znf> ah, good
[20:21:24] <robertmaxrees> so long as everything is wrapped in an iife, you're g2g
