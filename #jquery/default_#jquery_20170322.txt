[01:14:46] <jsharpminor> hi
[01:14:51] <jsharpminor> i have a jsbin as follows
[01:14:52] <jsharpminor> http://jsbin.com/pumuroq/3/edit?html,css,js,output
[01:15:03] <jsharpminor> and this jsbin proves that i don't understand callbacks properly.
[01:15:18] <jsharpminor> I'm trying to pass data to a callback on a focus function.
[01:15:29] <jsharpminor> For $('input').each(
[01:15:32] <jsharpminor> For each input,
[01:15:52] <jsharpminor> if the input matches some value (var focusBid),
[01:15:58] <jsharpminor> addClass("focus") to it.
[01:16:07] <jsharpminor> But I either lose the context or lose the variable.
[01:16:50] <jsharpminor> I'm sure I'm making some idiot mistake here, and probably when I get an answer I'll have a better understanding of a callbacak function.
[01:17:52] <jsharpminor> I could do it anonymously, and get it done.
[01:18:08] <jsharpminor> But I'm trying to move away from the anonymous function and give this anonymous function a name.
[01:18:28] <jsharpminor> That's where I lose all context.
[03:59:59] <Kartagis> ahoy
[04:00:30] <Kartagis> am I supposed to be getting back a result like this? https://www.dropbox.com/s/4w0ga62ww7folii/Screenshot%202017-03-22%2010.56.07.png?dl=0
[04:03:06] <Cork> Kartagis: don't ask us to debug an image
[04:03:57] <Kartagis> Cork: I mean, isn't the syntax of the call correct?
[04:04:29] <Kartagis> Cork: it currently only works on phone because CORS
[04:06:32] <Cork> Kartagis: make a text dump of what it is you want to ask about, not an image
[04:15:19] <Kartagis> is it possible to make an ajax call and send access-control-allow-origin header in the process?
[04:19:33] <Cork> Kartagis: the server sends the header
[04:19:42] <Cork> cors would be pointless otherwise
[04:20:51] <Kartagis> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/ggyzo34c/ is what I want to ask about
[04:21:45] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/ggyzo34c/1/
[04:21:50] <Cork> other then that it looks fine
[04:22:46] <Cork> and ya, if the server answers with json data should be a javascript array or object
[04:23:29] <Kartagis> grr, I left out success
[04:24:33] <Kartagis> I just can't believe it
[04:24:35] <Kartagis> thanks
[04:31:30] <Cork> Kartagis: btw the modern syntax for ajax is $.ajax(url, {}).done(function() {})
[04:32:00] <Cork> i recommend trying to use it as it gives a more customizable usage of the method
[04:32:03] <Kartagis> thanks
[04:32:21] <Cork> where .done replaces success: function() {}
[04:37:24] <Kartagis> how about fail?
[04:59:12] <DelphiWorld> yo queryers
[04:59:58] <Kartagis> why am I getting iBeacon is not defined at https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/3hqp169p/ line 45?
[05:29:40] <Cork> Kartagis: uh.. cause it isn't ever defined?
[05:30:24] <Cork> (you're not sharing anything explaining why it would if it is)
[06:11:02] <Kartagis> Cork: lines 32-33
[06:12:13] <Cork> Kartagis: something, exists on something and on somethign i run forEach and create a local variable of something and it doesn't exist :/
[06:12:25] <Cork> not exactly descriptive do you think?
[06:40:16] <Kartagis> how can I access the major property of each beacon here? https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/3hqp169p/1/
[06:40:28] * Kartagis runs
[06:48:30] <Cork> Kartagis: https://jsfiddle.net/3hqp169p/2/
[06:48:45] <Cork> the code you used before doesn't seam to be getting the data you expect it to
[06:48:51] <Cork> cause it works just fine with that data
[07:06:01] <Kartagis> I literally have no idea why my code didn't work before. it is similar it seems
[07:11:15] <Kartagis> I just got an epiphany
[07:11:40] <Kartagis> jquery requires two parameters
[07:11:55] <Kartagis> whereas javascript needs only one
[08:34:54] <opticode> Hello everyone. With this simple code: http://pastebin.com/pizFfKEN wju the event .on('change'... works with code number 1, but not with number 2 ?
[08:35:10] <opticode> s/wju/why
[08:40:50] <Cork> opticode: line two runs the return value of SelectBoxs.init() not init
[08:41:04] <Cork> you need $(document).ready(function() {}) around it
[08:41:25] <Cork> meaning $(document).ready(function() { SelectBoxs.init({url:'./stat_ajax.php',trigger:'#business_area',container:'#cat'}) });
[09:01:48] <laravelnewbie> hello
[09:07:05] <opticode> Cork: Thankyou =)
[09:10:45] <opticode> Cork: with same code, how do I apply that for different selectors_
[09:10:46] <opticode> ?
[09:11:08] <opticode> calling two times SelectBoxs.init({}) doesn't work
[09:11:16] <opticode> with different parameters ofcourse
[09:11:37] <Cork> it should be as long as .init creates new variables
[09:11:52] <Cork> something it doesn't >_>
[09:12:09] <Cork> the way SelectBoxes is constructed it can ever only be one
[09:13:33] <laravelnewbie> if($(this).scrollTop() + $(this).height() >= $(document).height()) {
[09:13:35] <laravelnewbie> hello
[09:13:43] <laravelnewbie> I used this code to check if user reached bottom of page
[09:14:03] <laravelnewbie> but I'm not at the bottom and it does think im there
[09:15:52] <Cork> use scrollHeight and clientHeight
[09:16:43] <Cork> $(this).prop('scrollHeight') - $(this).scrollTop() - $(this).prop('clientHeight') <= 30 for example
[09:16:54] <Cork> to trigger when you get < 30 px from the end of the page
[09:17:30] <Cork> it is usually good to leave a few pixels wiggle room for the scrolling
[09:19:45] <laravelnewbie> I used this code
[09:20:12] <laravelnewbie> but imediatelly after I scroll it 'thinks' is at the bottom
[09:20:27] <Cork> have you tried the replacement?
[09:20:35] <laravelnewbie> yeah, your code
[09:23:28] <laravelnewbie> oh, it does now
[09:23:31] <laravelnewbie> thank you cork
[09:27:49] <Cork> opticode: the best option is prob to initializa a new instance of SelectBox for each time you call it, and store that as a .data() reference on the element you target
[09:32:22] <kanga> I don't think this is specifically a jquery question, but I'm having a lot of trouble finding resources for how I'd load html views into a bootbox dialog. anyone have any experience? I have a chartist graph that loads different modals when different areas are selected, but i will need to render different views in the modal based on where the user clicked and the user's session information/data
[10:31:30] <opticode> Cork: "the way SelectBoxes is constructed it can ever only be one" what I need to change?
[10:32:09] <Cork> opticode: you need to make it so it one way or another stores the data separately for each request
[10:32:27] <Cork> one of the ways to do that is to make it a constructor and make an object when .init is called
[10:33:35] <opticode> how do I make that object? My skills on js are a bit basic
[10:37:08] <Cork> the simlest way is to do SelectBoxes = function(arg1, arg2) { this.config = arg1; /* ... */ } $('#selector').data('selectbox', new SelectBox({ conf: "something"}, { something: "else" }));
[10:37:44] <Cork> then you can do $('#selector').data('selectbox').method() to call functions from SelectBoxes.protoptype
[10:39:27] <opticode> .data ?
[10:39:36] <opticode> where that come from?
[10:43:06] <Cork> opticode: https://jsfiddle.net/xnrjL51c/
[10:43:27] <Cork> .data() is just a way to store data associated with an element in jquery
[10:44:22] <Cork> opticode: https://jsfiddle.net/xnrjL51c/1/
[10:46:49] <opticode> Cork: let me see if I understand that
[11:00:03] <Cork> opticode: here is a slightly different structure to do the same thing https://jsfiddle.net/xnrjL51c/2/
[11:00:23] <Cork> (it basically wrapps the new in a function so the caller doesn't have to use it)
[11:11:29] <opticode> Cork: where do I define the on.change() in your code? I can understand your code, but I can't apply to my task. maybe I doesn't understand ^^
[11:44:07] <DelphiWorld> hey guys
[11:44:16] <DelphiWorld> what's the diference bethwan the .get and .ajax?
[11:45:15] <DelphiWorld> i am doing: $.get("http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nq0gn/episodes/downloads.rss", function(data) {
[11:45:20] <DelphiWorld> but getting cor issue
[11:47:34] <Uhkis> .get is just a shorthand for .ajax
[11:47:53] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: i see
[11:48:09] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: so how could i add cor headers
[11:48:10] <Uhkis> and you get a cors error because bbc doesn't allow it
[11:49:03] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: strange. why firefox can fetch that rss feed
[11:49:20] <DelphiWorld> and the code i have can fetch it on mobile but not on pc
[11:52:44] <Uhkis> it shouldn't be able
[11:53:03] <DelphiWorld> so the mobile can display it inside cordova
[11:53:10] <DelphiWorld> and wondring how could rss readers can fetch it
[11:58:16] <Uhkis> they probably use some backend workaround
[11:58:47] <sayhi> hey
[11:59:03] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: lol
[11:59:16] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: bro, i am able to open the rss feed using the same code inside of cordova
[12:00:49] <Uhkis> DelphiWorld: doesnt cordova compile webapp to native code?
[12:01:19] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: i dont believe that, the code will still be html!
[12:01:38] <sayhi> is it possible to create a "generalized" eventhandler like so: on(eventType, handleEvent(event, eventType)) ?
[12:01:58] <sayhi> so i can catch, click - drag - etc with one function?
[12:03:48] <Uhkis> sayhi: on('event event2 event3') etc should work
[12:04:29] <opticode> Cork:
[12:04:35] <opticode> or anyone
[12:05:22] <opticode> This code can be optimized in an object way? If, yes, how? http://pastebin.com/XWWqEgk8
[12:07:58] <Uhkis> sayhi: https://jsfiddle.net/x80bpv8y/ like this
[12:08:57] <sayhi> that'll do fine - thanks Uhkis
[12:10:48] <opticode> when I said optimized, can be organized as well.
[12:11:31] <Uhkis> opticode: might be more readable if you passed those three arguments instead of object with keys
[12:13:59] <opticode> Uhkis: I see. But any other way how to this by follow best practices?
[12:15:00] <Uhkis> opticode: it's so simple there's really no room for optimization
[12:16:40] <opticode> Uhkis: I'm doing this in a way to apply for any future use of ajax call's with <select>'s
[12:17:36] <Uhkis> opticode: you could probably use some error checking on that callAjax function
[12:17:53] <Uhkis> as in check if those trigger and container actually exist
[12:19:19] <opticode> sure.
[12:20:36] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: in term of a news article markup, do "date" need to have any special look?
[12:22:37] <Gsham> im using jquery to wrap a element. then im adding a class to a parent item. i need to wait till the wrap is finished to add the class or the transitions dont take effect
[12:22:48] <Gsham> should i use setTimeOut or is there something better
[12:23:02] <Uhkis> DelphiWorld: what do you mean by news article markup?
[12:23:18] <DelphiWorld> like a bbc news article, or any news site
[12:24:30] <Uhkis> DelphiWorld: those are pretty much random
[12:25:02] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: i'm asking because i'm doing a rss reader, but i have no idea of the look because i'm blind
[12:25:36] <Uhkis> DelphiWorld: rss has a standard
[12:26:04] <Uhkis> DelphiWorld: https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html#optionalChannelElements
[12:26:33] <DelphiWorld> reading
[12:50:50] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: anything wrong in my line?
[12:50:53] <DelphiWorld> <button onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share('{{{title}}}, null, null, '{{{url}}}')">message and link</button>
[12:51:02] <hlve> Yum. Inline JS.
[12:51:04] * hlve shudders
[12:51:37] <DelphiWorld> lol hlve
[12:51:51] <DelphiWorld> that crazy ' was not closed... sham on me
[12:52:05] <hlve> Why not define that in an external file?
[12:52:07] <hlve> :(
[12:52:15] <hlve> Inline anything is bad practice.
[12:52:20] <DelphiWorld> hlve: so sad?
[12:52:33] <hlve> I just respect clean code.
[12:52:44] <DelphiWorld> hlve: yep and i respect you too ;)
[12:52:59] <DelphiWorld> hlve: i just touk an example from that sharing plugin
[12:53:24] <DelphiWorld> i hope it can run  on another js file, because i'm using a handlebar templating
[12:56:36] <DelphiWorld> hlve: i can feed a div with html code using js right?
[12:57:17] <hlve> yes
[12:58:04] <DelphiWorld> and how to test if a string is empty?
[12:58:11] <robertmaxrees> .length
[12:58:13] <hlve> ^
[12:58:20] <robertmaxrees> if (!someString.length) {}
[12:58:22] <hlve> robertmaxrees, again with the helpfulness.
[12:58:42] <DelphiWorld> hlve: robertmaxrees and taplar was very helpfull to me
[12:58:58] <DelphiWorld> thanks so much to both of them and all the jq community
[12:59:53] <DelphiWorld> what i dont understand is the "!" mark
[13:19:16] <momomo> anyone here with an iphone 6/6s/7 that can try out a link?
[13:19:38] <jsharpminor> hi
[13:19:42] <jsharpminor> i have a jsbin as follows
[13:19:43] <DelphiWorld> momomo: iPhone 6+
[13:19:48] <jsharpminor> http://jsbin.com/pumuroq/3/edit?html,css,js,output
[13:19:55] <jsharpminor> and this jsbin proves that i don't understand callbacks properly.
[13:19:59] <momomo> DelphiWorld: i will send you the link privately
[13:20:00] <jsharpminor> I'm trying to pass data to a callback on a focus function.
[13:20:14] <jsharpminor> For each input,  --- $('input').each(
[13:20:22] <jsharpminor> if the input matches some value (var focusBid),
[13:20:26] <jsharpminor> addClass("focus") to it.
[13:20:31] <jsharpminor> But I either lose the context or lose the variable.
[13:20:35] <jsharpminor> I'm sure I'm making some idiot mistake here, and probably when I get an answer I'll have a better understanding of a callbacak function.
[13:20:41] <jsharpminor> I could do it anonymously, and get it done.
[13:20:45] <jsharpminor> But I'm trying to move away from the anonymous function and give this anonymous function a name.
[13:20:49] <jsharpminor> That's where I lose all context.
[13:21:05] <jsharpminor> momomo: I'm on a LG V10 or I would volunteer
[13:28:39] <momomo> jsharpminor: thanks for the kind offer :)
[13:38:02] <Clickys> guys iam using jquery for a draggable object andit seems that in codepen is working properly but on my project when i click the object to grab it my mouse pointer its left of the element far left . does anyone have any idea why? and iam using the same code as here http://codepen.io/Clickys/pen/ryvxer
[13:38:42] <Keytap> Afternoon gents.
[13:38:46] <robertmaxrees> like, the element gets movied way far to the right, Clickys?
[13:38:52] <Clickys> yes robert
[13:38:56] <robertmaxrees> Clickys CSS.
[13:39:03] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have a positioning problem.
[13:39:19] <Clickys> it might be the cuz of the bootstrap ?
[13:39:31] <robertmaxrees> or some other CSS you're using, yeah.
[13:39:42] <robertmaxrees> but mixing JQUI and bootstrap is generally something to avoid.
[13:40:19] <Clickys> robert: didnt know that :/
[13:41:40] <Clickys> robert: i turn off the bootstrap and it works
[13:41:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:41:53] <robertmaxrees> i would look for a bootstrap drag and drop lib.
[13:42:17] <plamb> robertmaxrees: you around
[13:42:30] <plamb> is there anyway to use replace to replace the ">" with <br>'s here: https://jsfiddle.net/sLt939wn/6/
[13:42:32] <robertmaxrees> along with almost 500 other people.
[13:42:38] <plamb> :(
[13:42:49] <robertmaxrees> lol you can just ask the channel.
[13:42:57] <robertmaxrees> anyway -yeah.
[13:43:04] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting stuck?
[13:43:30] <plamb> hmmm
[13:44:03] <plamb> just doesnt seem to work, i tried .replace(">","<br>") and .replace("/>/g","<br>")
[13:44:07] <robertmaxrees> show me
[13:44:50] <robertmaxrees> because i can see one error there already.
[13:45:02] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/sLt939wn/7/
[13:45:03] <robertmaxrees> but the fiddle leaves out a detail.
[13:45:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so.
[13:45:14] <robertmaxrees> $('.lol').text().replace("/>/g","<br>")
[13:45:16] <robertmaxrees> not gonna work.
[13:45:29] <robertmaxrees> you need an actual regex object - $('.lol').text().replace(/>/g, "<br>")
[13:45:30] <plamb> whats wrong with that?
[13:45:45] <robertmaxrees> also: doing .replace() just returns a new string - it's not updating anything in place.
[13:46:17] <plamb> interesting
[13:46:35] <plamb> so the next step appending it into the html
[13:46:42] <robertmaxrees> not appending.
[13:46:47] <robertmaxrees> you want to replace the html that's there.
[13:47:47] <Clickys> robert: so basically you cant combine jquery UI and bootstrap. Whats the best to do , when i want to use some effect but i want the bootstrap grid layout or any similar layout so i wont manualy build thehtml skeleton ?
[13:48:04] <robertmaxrees> find a bootstrap plugin to do that for you.
[13:48:28] <robertmaxrees> though drag+drop with bootstrap can be a little strange since it's supposed to be mobile friendly.
[13:48:44] <plamb> im working through how to do this when there is more than one <p class="lol">
[13:49:02] <robertmaxrees> plamb one problem at a time, duder.
[13:49:07] <robertmaxrees> get it working for one first.
[13:50:16] <Clickys> robert: what do you mean find a bootstrap plugin ? what should i look for ?
[13:50:31] <robertmaxrees> search google.
[13:50:37] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap drag and drop
[13:50:39] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[13:50:44] <plamb> okay i think i got it robertmaxrees
[13:50:46] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/sLt939wn/8/
[13:51:20] <robertmaxrees> fwiw there's literally no reason to pass those args if you're not using them.
[13:51:33] <robertmaxrees> but that's the gist.
[13:52:46] <plamb> lol
[13:53:57] <tsukasadt> I'm trying to use .ajax() to retrieve JSON data from our LMS API, but it limits results to a max of 100 per page. I've setup the function to be able to pull all pages and merge the data. I setup the .ajax() to run asynchronous so I could pull the header data and return the responseText, but the final result is only coming out as the last page of data. https://thepasteb.in/p/2RhJc2JQ9jJggfz
[13:54:28] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt async: false
[13:54:36] <robertmaxrees> you're forcing the whole thing to run synchronously.
[13:55:13] <tsukasadt> Sorry, I meant to say I set it to run synchronous for those reasons. Without it, I get errors on the followup lines.
[13:55:29] <robertmaxrees> because you're not using ajax correctly.
[13:56:05] <tsukasadt> I'm not using it correctly so that I can pull the header data and combine the responseText into a single result.
[13:56:15] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to do it that way.
[13:56:40] <robertmaxrees> you could get an array of promises and use .when() to do something when they're all done.
[13:57:53] <tsukasadt> I haven't a clue how to set that up. ^^'
[13:58:14] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[13:58:24] <tsukasadt> I'm reading it, now. :)
[13:59:51] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:00:01] <Clickys> robert ty btw for the help
[14:16:01] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, I rewrote it with $.when().then(), but now it is only returning 100 results, combining the final page with x results for the second to last page. https://thepasteb.in/p/2RhJc2JQ9jJggfz
[14:20:43] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, nvm, I figured it out. I was trying to use $.extend() when I should've been using $.merge().
[14:20:55] <tsukasadt> ty for pointing my to .when(). :)
[14:30:16] <DelphiWorld> hey
[14:30:35] <DelphiWorld> why my $("#div").html("..."); isn't working here? https://dpaste.de/bexC
[14:30:42] <DelphiWorld> am i making the string wrong?
[14:32:16] <tsukasadt> DelphiWorld, there is no element with an ID of "div" in that code.
[14:33:11] <DelphiWorld> tsukasadt: see <div id="playbox">
[14:33:32] <DelphiWorld> tsukasadt: i think the issue is the html string manipulation
[14:34:02] <tsukasadt> Try wrapping your jQuery in (function() {});
[14:34:05] <DelphiWorld> could be that the .html is having conflict with the "quotes" inside html
[14:34:29] <DelphiWorld> tsukasadt: where? could you post the line?
[14:35:25] <DelphiWorld> tsukasadt: my issue is only with the .html
[14:35:31] <DelphiWorld> cause if i do a simple line, like:
[14:35:46] <tsukasadt> Scratch that, remove the line returns in the .html().
[14:35:51] <DelphiWorld> $("#div").html("<p>ping</p>"); it works
[14:35:57] <tsukasadt> $("#playbox").html('<audio id="player" preload ><source src="http://bbcwssc.ic.llnwd.net/stream/bbcwssc_mp1_ws-araba?type=.mp3" title="High"></audio>');
[14:36:41] <tsukasadt> Strings won't support the line returns.
[14:37:40] <tsukasadt> If you want to have the line returns, break up the actual string and return between the fragments.
[14:38:00] <DelphiWorld> ok, if i want to do multilines?
[14:38:33] <DelphiWorld> not displayed
[14:38:54] <tsukasadt> If you want multiple lines in the JS, use what I just said. If you not displayed line returns, use the escape character: \n

[14:45:59] <Es0teric> question -- how does event binding work? i havent used jquery in awhile and i just need a refresh on it
[14:46:19] <Es0teric> meaning.. the .bind() event
[15:06:51] <uskerine> hi, can someone help me to understand if this click event is properly configured? I want the web page to reack when user clicks on the <img>
[15:06:52] <uskerine> https://bpaste.net/show/50bc13ce87e2
[15:07:42] <Uhkis> uskerine: please use jsfiddle.net
[15:08:57] <Uhkis> uskerine: you forgot function() {}
[15:12:25] <uskerine> https://jsfiddle.net/43crL4ba/1/
[15:12:46] <jsharpminor> How can you tell what data $.each() is going to push to the callback function? Is it possible to add additional parameters?
[15:12:56] <uskerine> https://jsfiddle.net/43crL4ba/2/
[15:15:21] <uskerine> Uhkis I added function(){ but still not working, either I am missing something obvious or maybe the event propagation from the img taf is not so obviuos
[15:17:19] <Uhkis> uskerine: https://jsfiddle.net/43crL4ba/5/ you forgot to add jquery in it
[15:18:25] <uskerine> wow
[15:18:26] <uskerine> thanks
[15:21:55] <uskerine> one question, -and I cna not easily share that in jsfiddle-, there is an additional bootstrap mega menu event on that click, is it possible to prevent that event from happening when user clicks on img? so my handler stops processing or passing further the event
[15:21:56] <uskerine> thanks
[15:24:58] <Uhkis> no idea about that
[15:25:11] <Uhkis> maybe off() might help?
[15:59:59] <Keytap> Good afternoon gents.  Quick question for you:  I'm working with jQuery 1.9 and I'm triggering an event created using jQuery.Event.
[16:00:31] <Keytap> In 3 I would access the properties set in the second parameter of Event by just accessing them on the event object in the callback.
[16:00:43] <Keytap> However in 1.9, you don't seem to be able to do that.
[16:00:51] <Keytap> How do I go about get that data?
[16:01:20] <Keytap> scratch that
[16:01:26] <Keytap> Turns out I'm a dumb
[16:02:01] <Uhkis> Keytap: doubt it
[16:02:14] <Uhkis> Keytap: that's just rubberduck debugging :)
[16:03:33] <Keytap> Haven't heard that one in a while.  But yeah, pretty much.
[17:54:33] <Utils> I'm stuck here. I'm trying to simulate a "drop" type of thing. I'm using jquery ui draggable, and I animate top to 100% upon drop so it's as if the element is falling.
[17:55:31] <Utils> At the bottom of the page is like a moving container icon (like a trashcan or something). The idea is that I'd check if certain points of the element that is to be dropped is within the confines of the trashcan.
[17:56:48] <Utils> Is there a way to add like an event for an animation tick? so i can do stuff repeatedly during the animation, or listen to when the 'top' changes?
[18:36:36] <Utils> ok there is .position() which contains almost what I'd like I suppose but in the case of using left: 0; and animating margin-left then position().left will always be 0
[18:36:56] <Utils> but at that point i guess i can rely on marginleft
[18:48:00] <Utils> If you delet an element that's animating, does the animation continue and does the animation callback trigger?
[18:52:36] <cannap> are you delete the whole div?
[18:53:29] <cannap> wow
[18:53:44] <cannap> i never think about that situation
[18:54:02] <cannap> animations are sync
[18:54:28] <cannap> wait lets make a example
[18:57:08] <Utils> the animation stops but the callback is fired. i can make that work ^^
[18:58:14] <cannap> hm
[19:11:19] <fedek> Hey!!  Why is this not working?
[19:11:23] <fedek> http://pastebin.com/HNw1FndZ
[19:39:33] <bjsnider> i guess it would be possible to copy a block of various markup between a specific class, and duplicate it repeatedly based on a button, maybe a plus sign or whatever, while also incrementing a number inside the inputs?
[19:39:55] <bjsnider> and obviously there's have to be a way to also remove the blocks, perhaps a minus button
[19:44:19] <Gsham> is there any way to wait for .wrap() to finish?
[19:44:34] <robertmaxrees> it's not async sooo...
