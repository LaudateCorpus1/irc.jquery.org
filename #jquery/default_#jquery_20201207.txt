[17:22:28] <jabberwock> Hello. In the context of $('tr > span.myclass').. how would I find the first $('a.commit') in that tr?
[17:22:57] <jabberwock> I get some info from the span which I use to scroll to that element. But then I want to call the onhover for the $('a.commit') in that same 'tr'
[17:47:29] <pavonia> jabberwock: $(this).parent().find(...)
[17:48:10] <jabberwock> thanks pavonia
