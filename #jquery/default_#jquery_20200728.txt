[05:31:00] <LouisS> Hello good morning I have a question. it is possible to hide content from a dropdown list when a form is submitted. That the selected and sent value does not appear to the user again ? ty!
[05:34:10] <Cork> Lucas_Gray: no, select element is replaced elements and hiding values is not supported
[05:34:20] <Cork> you have to do .remove() on the option entry
[05:43:28] <LouisS> So i guess that is for my question :p
[14:37:07] <Wafficus> hi there, I have a question regarding using the .load() function in JQuery. Is it possible for a site to be loaded within another one to be clearly defined inside of a container rather than to take up the entire page?
[14:37:19] <Wafficus> https://www.musimatic.net/FakeWebsites/PageCeption/
[14:37:49] <robertmaxrees> linking to a random page with a vague question isn't helpful :)
[14:37:57] <Wafficus> rather here is my example sorry
[14:37:59] <Wafficus> https://www.musimatic.net/FakeWebsites/PageCeption/loadingHTMLIntoAPageWithJQuery.html
[14:38:06] <robertmaxrees> which code specifically?
[14:38:09] <Wafficus> well it demonstrates the problem i'm having though
[14:39:16] <robertmaxrees> I guess I'm unclear about the problem statemenet - yeah you can load that content into a div on the page.  But I'm not sure that's really what you're intending to ask :)
[14:39:37] <Wafficus> https://termbin.com/uuyr
[14:39:51] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what's happening now, and what would you rather have happen?
[14:39:59] <Wafficus> yeah I've loaded it into the intended div.
[14:40:13] <Wafficus> I think it might be the Wikipedia site's CSS present though that's overpowering the entire site though
[14:40:47] <robertmaxrees> ah, so you're wondering if there's a way to "sandbox" the other pages, basically?
[14:40:47] <Wafficus> just wanted to confirm if that's just a CSS flaw with loading a wiki type site in a <div> tag in this kind of manner. Its creating this awkward blending effect with the page where it just juts out all of the place
[14:40:50] <Wafficus> yes
[14:40:56] <robertmaxrees> that's what iframes are for.
[14:40:56] <Wafficus> that's a good way of putting it, yeah
[14:41:07] <Wafficus> so use an iframe tag in this case, got it
[14:41:11] <robertmaxrees> but also
[14:41:11] <Wafficus> *instead of a div tag
[14:41:15] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:41:18] <robertmaxrees> and no ajax.
[14:41:25] <robertmaxrees> just use a normal iframe with a source, etc.
[14:41:37] <Wafficus> But I'm trying out JQuery Ajax though in this example
[14:41:41] <Wafficus> so that would defeat the purpose
[14:41:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery ajax is the wrong tool for this job :)
[14:43:34] <robertmaxrees> using jQuery to handle things like this is going to give you headaches.  now, if you had isolated, small markup fragments, that would be even better.
[14:43:51] <robertmaxrees> or take it a step further and load JSON data that you then render client-side.  that would be your best bet.
[14:48:06] <Wafficus> gonna try a simpler page
[14:48:39] <robertmaxrees> just create a simple div with some text and call it a day :)
[14:48:59] <robertmaxrees> since you're just trying to learn how to use it, that's a great place to start.
[14:57:36] <Wafficus> yeah exactly what I did ha
[14:57:40] <Wafficus> true
[14:57:42] <Wafficus> thanks for the help :D
[16:26:57] <Phruis> im having an issue where my select2 function isn't being found even though i have it in a $(function() {
[16:27:40] <robertmaxrees> Phruis can you share your code?
[16:31:40] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:32:39] <Waldkauz> It's funnier if we guess what the problem is
[16:33:01] <Phruis> i don'
[16:33:06] <Phruis> i don't think it is possible
[16:33:13] <robertmaxrees> Phruis what isn't possible?
[16:33:31] <Phruis> I can't re-create the situation without a lot of extra work
[16:33:48] <Phruis> i was wondering if anyone knew of something obvious i was missing
[16:33:51] <robertmaxrees> can you at least show us the document ready and select2 function call itself?
[16:33:55] <Phruis> not create a test case
[16:34:04] <Phruis> its a modal
[16:34:09] <robertmaxrees> that's fine- - just the code non-functioning might be enough.
[16:34:09] <Phruis> in a bootstrap 3
[16:34:22] <robertmaxrees> aaaah - a select2 in a modal within bootstrap?
[16:34:37] <Phruis> select2 is a js library
[16:34:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:35:01] <robertmaxrees> either way - that might be your issue.  iirc bootstrap does funky things when it comes to modals - might need to init the select2 when the modal is initialized/launched.
[16:36:03] <Phruis> thanks for the tip
[19:58:54] <Phruis> I think it isn't a problem with select2 at all
[19:59:03] <Phruis> it is some jquery issue where it is unloaded?
[19:59:18] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:59:20] <robertmaxrees> "either way - that might be your issue.  iirc bootstrap does funky things when it comes to modals - might need to init the select2 when the modal is initialized/launched."
[19:59:20] <Phruis> all jquery functions work properly, but when I open a modal it breaks?
[19:59:52] <Phruis> so confused
[19:59:55] <Phruis> ok
[19:59:58] <robertmaxrees> how so?
[20:00:17] <Phruis> my debugger isn't helping isolate the issue
[20:00:43] <robertmaxrees> what are you breakpointing on??
[20:03:03] <robertmaxrees> Phruis part of the issue is you're not really giving us much to work with.  setting up a test case for something like this is actually pretty straightforward :)
[20:03:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/27s3axgt/3/
[20:04:26] <Phruis> i know apologize for that this is a very huge site and its hard to isolate what the problem is
[20:04:53] <robertmaxrees> so let's get that fiddle to break in the same way :)
[20:05:01] <robertmaxrees> i don't need the entire page, just enough to reproduce the bug.
