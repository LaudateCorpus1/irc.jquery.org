[10:43:59] <hollusion> $('<html><head></head><body>...')
[10:44:07] <hollusion> wont be fully parsed
[10:44:22] <hollusion> resulting in an array like object not containing head or body but its contents
[10:44:32] <hollusion> is there a way to circumvent this?
[12:57:44] <toaderas> hi, I want to ask again, is there a way I can do padding-top using animate but in a similar way to !important so that we make sure no other page style can interfere ?
[12:59:39] <jolvera> that's a #css question
[13:01:39] <toaderas> no it's a jquery question, if jquery was allowing !important this would work
[13:03:27] <jolvera> then toggle a class that has !important
[13:03:51] <toaderas> you don't understand this, animate is supposed to do that gradually if I toggle that in a class it will do it instantly
[13:04:14] <jolvera> how are you animating it?
[13:04:42] <toaderas> $('body').animate( { "padding-top": "50" }, 400);
[13:06:57] <jolvera> don't animate with jQuery then, create a class that will do the animation and manage from there
[13:08:04] <MassDebates> reading now
[13:08:15] <MassDebates> Uh, yeah
[13:08:18] <MassDebates> You just add specificity
[13:08:25] <MassDebates> Jquery has the ability to interpret selectors.
[13:08:34] <MassDebates> jquery can also put in !important
[13:08:52] <toaderas> MassDebates: how do you add specifity to that particular one?
[13:08:52] <MassDebates> Doing a class swap is a simple way of handling it
[13:08:54] <jolvera> i googled it and the first result is this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1986182/how-to-include-important-in-jquery
[13:09:06] <MassDebates> toaderas, pump out a codepen or jsfiddle if you want me to make something for ya :)
[13:09:21] <MassDebates> I think it's better for your development as a coder to try to solve it on your own, first!
[13:09:41] <MassDebates> I'm not sure if #css would touch this one, to be honest.
[13:10:03] <toaderas> MassDebates: The question is very specific, how do you combine !important with jquery's animate
[13:10:07] <MassDebates> This is a jquery question because he's actuating it in jquery. The issue here is how to do it in jquery, not what css's role in this is.
[13:10:25] <MassDebates> toaderas, my instructions were just as specific as your question, if not moreso. Make a codepen or jsfiddle, first.
[13:10:52] <MassDebates> a pared down testcase is the best way to provide a solution.
[13:11:32] <toaderas> MassDebates: "try to solve it on your own, first" this is not a problem to solve, it's a simple familiarity question for those who have in mind how jquery deals with it
[13:13:13] <MassDebates> a pared down testcase is the best way to provide a solution.
[13:13:30] <MassDebates> Put your problem code in a codepen and paste its resulting URL here.
[13:13:35] <toaderas> MassDebates: what solution? it's a simple question of how animate can be combined with important... there is no problem
[13:13:37] <jolvera> help us to help you
[13:13:57] <jolvera> lol
[13:14:04] <MassDebates> You can't help those who can't be helped.
[13:14:28] <MassDebates> I know what answer he wanted but I can't reliably give out the right code for it without seeing the context.
[13:14:56] <jolvera> and you shouldn't anyway, if he's not willing to make it easier for you to help
[13:15:00] <MassDebates> Right
[13:15:14] <MassDebates> anywho, back to my caesar salad
[16:51:53] <jjrabbit> robertmaxrees: you around?
[16:51:59] <robertmaxrees> heh yeah
[16:52:06] <robertmaxrees> no need to ping me tho ;)
[16:52:06] <jjrabbit> ok quick question lol
[16:52:18] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[16:52:22] <jjrabbit> i know but this builds off what we discussed yesterday
[16:53:17] <jjrabbit> i'm wondering why when you press the "Down" button once, then the "Up" button once the red box ends up in two different places
[16:53:22] <jjrabbit> https://jsfiddle.net/dsf8ymoj/
[16:54:01] <jjrabbit> i know to fix it i should initialize currentY = 0
[16:54:07] <jjrabbit> instead of $('#myItem').position().top;
[16:54:59] <jjrabbit> but i thought i need to use the currentY position of the element
[16:57:01] <robertmaxrees> probably has something to do with offset vs translate
[16:57:40] <jjrabbit> for example, this works as expected: https://jsfiddle.net/fkcmgLwd/
[16:57:58] <robertmaxrees> so then why not just use that?
[16:58:11] <jjrabbit> because i didn't write it lol
[16:58:19] <jjrabbit> i want to understand why mine isn't working
[16:58:51] <robertmaxrees> because that manually sets position to 0.
[16:59:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/fkcmgLwd/1/
[16:59:55] <robertmaxrees> translate vs position are different css properties.
[17:01:08] <jjrabbit> so translate moves something n pixels from where it's at, and position moves it directly on the grid?
[17:01:21] <jjrabbit> is that what's going on here?
[17:01:42] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7108941/css-transform-vs-position
[17:01:53] <robertmaxrees> plenty of reading material on the subject :)
[17:02:36] <jjrabbit> it says transform vs position, but he's talking about translate right?
[17:03:02] <robertmaxrees> $('#myItem').css('transform', 'translateY(' + pos + 'px)');
[17:03:15] <robertmaxrees> meant transform earlier.
[17:03:22] <robertmaxrees> transform as in the CSS property.,
[17:03:29] <jjrabbit> ok
[17:03:32] <robertmaxrees> but also translate.
[17:03:43] <robertmaxrees> google it and read up :)
[17:03:49] <jjrabbit> yea i need to lol
[17:03:51] <jjrabbit> ok thanks
[17:04:14] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw none of that required me to answer.  feel free to drop questions in the channel.
[17:04:19] <robertmaxrees> if someone can help, they will.
[17:04:43] <jjrabbit> yea turns out it was pretty general
[17:04:47] <jjrabbit> will do thanks
[17:04:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:42:44] <gambl0r3> hello?
[17:44:56] <gambl0r3> robertmaxrees, hey robert, you there?
[17:45:02] <robertmaxrees> in a meeting.
[17:45:08] <robertmaxrees> did you need something?
[17:45:59] <gambl0r3> oh sorry, i'll msg you later
[17:46:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:47:02] <robertmaxrees> gonna be in meetings for a while - what's up?'
[17:47:54] <gambl0r3> i'll wait. i dont want to interrupt you
[17:48:34] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:49:15] <gambl0r3> what?
[17:49:21] <robertmaxrees> what did you need?
[17:49:31] <robertmaxrees> you already pinged me - must be urgent.  so what's up?
[17:50:27] <gambl0r3> you're not listening. you said you're in a meeting so i'll wait till you're finished. let me know when you're done. thanks
[17:50:46] <robertmaxrees> alright i'm done.
[17:50:48] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[17:51:26] <gambl0r3> hows going?
[17:52:02] <gambl0r3> i was just wondering how to solve cors using ajax method
[17:52:08] <gambl0r3> i keep getting an error about cross origin
[17:52:15] <robertmaxrees> you don't from your side.
[17:52:25] <robertmaxrees> the server you're calling to needs to be configured to allow it.
[17:53:08] <robertmaxrees> woops
[17:53:24] <robertmaxrees> anyway - the server you're calling to needs to allow cors.
[17:54:48] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[17:55:35] <gambl0r3> no
[17:55:50] <robertmaxrees> where did I lose you?
[17:56:31] <gambl0r3> server you're calling to needs to allow cors
[17:56:46] <robertmaxrees> okay so your AJAX call
[17:56:57] <robertmaxrees> you know how you pass it a URL?
[17:57:25] <robertmaxrees> either by doing $.ajax('http://someurl.com') or $.ajax({ url: 'http://someurl.com' ]); ?
[17:57:33] <robertmaxrees> err, } not ] but you get the idea.
[18:00:15] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[18:03:20] <gambl0r3> i dont understand
[18:03:37] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so you have an ajax call, right?
[18:06:46] <gambl0r3> ya
[18:07:32] <robertmaxrees> so that ajax call is using a url, right?
[18:08:43] <gambl0r3> ya
[18:09:15] <robertmaxrees> that URL is pointing to a different port, protocol, or domain than the current page.
[18:10:12] <robertmaxrees> so, for example, let's say the current page is https://foo.com/hello and the ajax is requesting data from https://bar.com/hello - these two origins are different.
[18:10:29] <robertmaxrees> because the domain (the foo.com and bar.com) are different.
[18:10:32] <robertmaxrees> follow?
