[02:03:57] <EugenA> I need some help, I need to animate 3 divs: at the bottom appears the 4th one, and the other divs should move up, first should disappear.
[02:56:48] <Mark_____> how do i make certain scripts not be executed when accessed from a mobile device?
[03:02:03] <Auctus> if i add class='saveproduct' elements to the page later, this should work on dynamically added elements? If I just say this once in the javascript after document ready?
[03:02:06] <Auctus>     $('.saveproduct').on('click', function(){alert('clicked!');});
[03:02:40] <Auctus> it does nothing, all my .saveproduct elements are added after the page is created, i suspect thats causing problems
[03:06:47] <Auctus> ah, it should say $('body').on('click','.saveproduct', etc
[03:06:54] <Auctus> or some element lower than body, whatever
[05:33:04] <RudyValencia> So I have a Web service that maintains an encrypted view state that I have to pass to another handler for frther processing. I want to receive the second result in a new window but can't see how to do it; my code is pasted at https://dpaste.de/cZmq - how do I get the output of the final response (a PDF) to show in a new Window?
[05:34:10] <RudyValencia> *for further processing.
[05:37:28] <Demonen> Dump the data to PDF somewhere temporary, open a new window pointing to it on the clientside?
[05:39:47] <Demonen> Like /fetchPDF/24ed702dc2b79dc76eb08e20a48679b58a713405.pdf

[09:26:11] <fergal> hi guys. i use jquery to determine if a particular div should be displayed on my website. the jquery compares the client ip with a list of ip addresses stored in a .csv file, and if no match is found, the div is displayed. the solution i have works, and does what i want it to do, i was just curious if someone here could look at my code to see if it could be cleaned up a little/simplified, since iâ€™m a jquery noob:

[15:55:55] <gambl0re> is there a insertAfter() for vanilal js
[15:58:32] <decx> you insertBefore nextSibling to insert after
[15:59:29] <gambl0re> theres no built in function that does this?
[16:04:41] <gambl0re> i guess not..
[17:30:41] <albedoa> if you use filter() to filter out objects in an array based on a condition, what's a good way of retaining the remainder / non-filtered items?
[17:30:52] <albedoa> i'm using filter() again on the opposite condition right now
[17:31:00] <albedoa> but wondering if there's a better way
[17:31:53] <albedoa> i could do it in the callback of the first filter() too
[17:46:59] <geri> hi decx
[18:35:54] <arc_> can anyone tell me why this only appends the element to the first ul and not the third one
[18:35:55] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/8ooxxpux/
[18:36:46] <geri> hi decx are u around?
[18:36:50] <arc_> the console.log on line 7 returns what i expect every time
[18:37:22] <arc_> it shouldn't even be possible for that to return what i expect and for nothing to get appended to it
[18:46:24] <arc_> if i replace the variable i'm appending with a static string, it appends to every element as expected
[18:47:55] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/8ooxxpux/1/
[18:49:27] <arc_> i guess it must just be that the object is being moved instead of cloned
[18:49:32] <arc_> there's no other explanation
[18:49:35] <arc_> i don't understand why that is, but
[18:51:11] <arc_> yep. if i move the variable declarations inside the each so they're happening each time, it works as expected
[19:07:31] <shoky> arc_: if you want to append a clone you can .append(elem.clone())  otherwise you keep moving the same element around
[19:08:16] <arc_> oic :p
[19:08:52] <arc_> well yeah that's basically what i figured out was going on, but i did not realize .clone() was a thing
[19:10:00] <arc_> it was kind of tricking me because of the fact that jquery objects made from a selector that includes multiple elements are in reverse order
[19:10:27] <arc_> so it was actually working each time, but it just ended up looking like it only did it the first time
[19:10:43] <arc_> if the link ended up on the last one, i probably would have figured it out faster
[19:14:44] <shoky> arc_: it's the .parents() that's reversing the order (the docs mention this).  you should use .closest() instead of parents() usually
[19:17:29] <arc_> mm, yeah. i think i initially used closest() but i ended up having to change what i was doing a few times because of some strange markup choices on the site
[19:51:46] <arc_> haha, omg. i fell victim to the same exact problem like 30 minutes later
[19:51:51] <arc_> been working on this too long
[20:23:01] <geri> hi, how can i overlay a <div id="dialog" on to a canvas?
