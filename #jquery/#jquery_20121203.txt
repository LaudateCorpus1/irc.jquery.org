[00:02:01] <ravenzz> morning
[00:03:40] <ravenzz> is it legit to unbind events like this http://pastie.org/5470450 ?
[00:04:55] <ravenzz> the problem is that $(document) could have multiple click event handlers, I want to unbind only the triggered one
[00:05:18] <BinaryKitten> ravenzz use event namespacing
[00:05:36] <ravenzz> like click.foo ?
[00:06:14] <BinaryKitten> yup
[00:06:51] <ravenzz> BinaryKitten it could work
[00:06:53] <BinaryKitten> http://api.jquery.com/event.namespace/
[00:07:21] <ravenzz> yeah I have read about it, I should read it again.
[00:07:30] <BinaryKitten> :)
[00:07:36] * BinaryKitten actually departs now
[00:07:46] <ravenzz> oh no!
[00:07:58] <BinaryKitten> oh no?
[00:08:21] <ravenzz> are you going to leave?
[00:08:26] <BinaryKitten> well yes
[00:08:42] <BinaryKitten> have this thing called a job .. lol .. they kind of expect me to turn up and work
[00:08:55] <BinaryKitten> this does require me to leave my domicile and travel
[00:08:58] <BinaryKitten> :D
[00:09:06] <ravenzz> I had one more question to ask, more a opinion
[00:09:09] <ravenzz> lol
[00:09:11] <BinaryKitten> sure
[00:09:25] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/mLQqu/
[00:09:54] <ravenzz> it is a tooltip plugin, when it is shown on hover I want to pin it on click
[00:10:18] <ravenzz> it is working, should I bind just one event handler for all of them?
[00:11:19] * BinaryKitten shudders at namespaced js
[00:11:32] <ravenzz> so $(document).on("click.tooltip") would close all of them
[00:11:34] <ravenzz> ^?
[00:11:38] <BinaryKitten> sorry, not my favourite thing in the world..
[00:11:44] <ravenzz> and I don't have to unbind it
[00:12:03] <BinaryKitten> you could do
[00:12:16] <BinaryKitten> except you probably want to use event delegation
[00:12:55] <ravenzz> I don't think so :o?
[00:13:08] <BinaryKitten> $(document).on('click.tooltip', GL.selectors.tooltip, Function() { })
[00:13:15] <ravenzz> that is just for hide all the visible tooltips
[00:13:42] <BinaryKitten> dunno .. that's heading into direct implementation
[00:13:45] <ravenzz> whenever I click any part of the screen
[00:13:52] <BinaryKitten> trigger teh click
[00:14:13] <BinaryKitten> $(GL.selectors.tooltip).trigger('click.tooltip);
[00:14:26] <BinaryKitten> or whatever you end up binding it to
[00:14:28] <BinaryKitten> etc
[00:14:32] <BinaryKitten> right
[00:14:34] <BinaryKitten> must go
[00:14:52] <ravenzz> nah, there could be hidden tooltips, that suddently would be shown :P
[00:14:53] <ravenzz> ok np
[00:14:56] <ravenzz> thank you.
[00:15:28] <ravenzz> I'd need to add further checks on the element's visibility
[00:17:35] <w00tner> how do i retrieve the value of a dropdown menu when clicked ... i have 4 elements and i want to store in a variable the value of the form
[00:18:08] <w00tner> i added a class to every option named "tipoLetra"
[00:18:15] <w00tner> then in jquery $('.tipoLetra').click(function(){
[00:18:24] <w00tner> var valorLetra = this.value;
[00:18:35] <w00tner> but is not working
[00:20:33] <se-lite> w00tner: add change event handler on the select element, then use $(this).val()
[00:21:09] <se-lite> type: $('#myselect').change ( function () { var blah = $(this).val() });
[00:25:33] <w00tner> and how can i apply the css to the element
[00:25:50] <se-lite> w00tner: which element?
[00:25:50] <w00tner> $('#addTexto').css("font-family", "'+ valorLetra +'");
[00:26:18] <se-lite> w00tner: make a jsfiddle example?
[00:26:32] <w00tner> ok
[00:28:37] <w00tner> http://pastebin.com/gq0V5TNZ
[00:28:44] <w00tner> i get the value correctly in the alert box
[00:30:47] <w00tner> oh it wasnt that div
[00:30:48] <w00tner> $('.customText').css("font-family", "'+ valorLetra +'");
[00:31:00] <w00tner> it resets the font type
[00:35:56] <w00tner> no need for quotes or concat :S
[00:35:59] <w00tner> working!
[00:43:08] <w00tner> can you tell me how to concatenate the em for the size
[00:43:09] <w00tner> $('.customText').css("font-size", sizeLetra );
[00:43:19] <w00tner> sizeLetra ' + em + '   ?
[00:46:00] <w00tner> helpp
[00:46:33] <koiti> hy. i am developing http://85.13.131.23/w00fc0b4/  on the right side i show some content when the users klick  on the pictures. my problem is that in chrome it works very fine but in FF the animation startet at a false locations. what am i doing wront?
[00:46:33] <w00tner> $('.customText').css("font-size", sizeLetra ' + em + ' );
[00:47:20] <w00tner> koiti
[00:47:38] <w00tner> how do you put the em together
[00:47:44] <w00tner> $('.customText').css("font-size", sizeLetra ' + em + ' );
[00:47:47] <w00tner> how ?
[00:47:53] <w00tner> sizeLetra is a variable
[00:49:13] <koiti> w00tner i do nothing with em as far as i know
[01:03:20] <se-lite> w00tner: i think you should learn some basic javascript syntax before moving more into jquery?
[01:03:43] <klawd> w00tner: i think you should learn some basic javascript syntax before moving more into jquery.
[01:04:19] <ravenzz> need help with this plugin, http://jsfiddle.net/sXjDJ/1/
[01:04:34] <ravenzz> the problem is at the bottom of the init method
[01:05:20] <ravenzz> where I bind the events. the $(document).on("click") is binded twice (in this case) or more in general as many time as the tooltips
[01:06:15] <ravenzz> this make is causing a failure when I rebind it if (closeEvent === "hover") {}
[01:07:01] <ravenzz> to reproduce the issue: you should hover one link. and click on it. You can then click any part of the document, and it will be closed
[01:07:24] <ravenzz> finally you should hover the other tooltip, and you'll we notice the bug
[01:12:20] <mattyh88> hey, is it possible to find the radiobutton element by its label?
[01:13:19] <se-lite> ravenzz: basicly clicking the document, then hover makes it go away right away?
[01:15:50] <ravenzz> hover one link -> the tooltip is show. click the link -> the tooltip doesn't disappear on mouseleave. Click somewhere in the page (document) -> the tooltip is hidden
[01:16:47] <ravenzz> so basically when I click the link, the plugin unbinds the mouseenter mouseout event.
[01:17:09] <ravenzz> so the tooltip can stay visible
[01:18:10] <ravenzz> the problem is here: $(document).on("click.plugin_" + pluginName + closeEvent) this is binded for each tooltip
[01:19:36] <w00tner> does anyone here uses colorjs ?
[01:21:03] <se-lite> ravenzz: why do you bind it again on document click?
[01:22:00] <se-lite> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/sXjDJ/2/ that looks sane to me?
[01:24:36] <ravenzz> se-lite if you don't rebind
[01:24:40] <ravenzz> it won't work again
[01:24:46] <ravenzz> :)
[01:24:56] <ardianta> hei
[01:25:54] <se-lite> ravenzz: when will it not work?
[01:26:02] <se-lite> maybe i just missunderstand the point :p
[01:26:23] <ravenzz> yeah it's my bad english's fault
[01:27:07] <ravenzz> se-lite hover on link, then click on it, then click on the document and it will be closed. then hover it again. with your "fix" it won't work anymore
[01:27:16] <ravenzz> and it make perfectly sense.
[01:27:39] <ravenzz> because when you click the link, the mouseenter mouseleave event is unbinded
[01:33:05] <RingtailedFox> this is odd.... i'm using the jquery table of contents generator from http://explosion-pills.com/development/jquery/plugins/headerlinks/
[01:33:16] <RingtailedFox> it works at http://www.mobianlegends.com/alpha/contact.php
[01:33:24] <RingtailedFox> but not at http://www.mobianlegends.com/games/index.php
[01:41:39] <Dahman> hi
[01:54:36] <ravenzz> se-lite fixed http://jsfiddle.net/sXjDJ/5/
[01:55:52] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/sXjDJ/6/ even better
[01:56:17] <ravenzz> now I wonder how good is this solution in terms of performance
[02:05:54] <Dahman> friends i want to ask about something
[02:06:56] <Dahman> is there any way to save a record from a streaming source by javascript or php
[02:06:58] <Dahman> ?
[02:08:04] <boulet101010_> depends of the way it's broadcasted (correct me if my english is bad)
[02:08:53] <Dahman> ur english is good
[02:08:54] <boulet101010_> for an icecast stream for example it should be possible
[02:09:23] <boulet101010_> (i feared that "broadcasted" wasn't right ^^‚Åæ
[02:09:26] <Dahman> i need for a video streaming
[02:09:43] <boulet101010_> what is the technology used to stream it?
[02:10:45] <Dahman> i dont know exactly ,but i use always an emebd object
[02:10:59] <Dahman> with flash param
[02:21:13] <boulet101010_> on which site you gonna record?
[02:21:25] <boulet101010_> (is the streaming source provided by you?)
[02:37:52] <mandarks> hey guys, i know were using $('parent').on('blah') but how can we expect that to play out when dealing with events such as hover, etc..
[02:40:02] <mandarks> hypothetical: $("body").on("hover, "#child", function(e) { $(this).css('border','yellow'); });
[02:40:18] <mandarks> what when you want to remove the border on hover out??
[02:46:13] <seutje> does on('hover' work? o.O
[02:46:48] <seutje> oh, it just maps it to mouseenter mouseleave
[02:47:01] <seutje> mandarks: split on e.type I guess
[02:47:47] <seutje> $("body").on("hover, "#child", function(e) { $(this).css('border',e.type === 'mouseenter' ? 'yellow' : ''); });
[02:48:12] <boulet101010_> Dahman: can you answer my question?
[02:48:16] <mandarks> awesome, cheers
[02:52:09] <Dahman> boulet : i said i dont know exactly
[02:52:20] <Dahman> i work with embed object
[02:52:35] <Dahman> with flash params
[02:55:00] <Cork> mandarks: preferably you should use a class to do that instead
[02:57:16] <mandarks> Cork: I think you're probably right
[02:57:40] <Cork> then you should just do addClass/removeClass or even toggleClass
[03:01:51] <army> anybody experience with google adsense and ajax pages, or is that completely impossible due to TOS
[03:01:59] <Birliban> hi, when i use $.grep() for a small array (< 1000 items) it works almost without delay. Now i have an array with 17.000 items an it stucks terrible, is there a faster way to filter that array?
[03:03:50] <se-lite> Birliban: depend on how you want to filter it i guess
[03:06:27] <Birliban> se-lite, i want to filter on keyup. input field and a list that is displayed in a select field updates with matching items
[03:16:27] <Cork> Birliban: make an async filter loop
[03:19:40] <Birliban> Cork, ok, maybe any example for this?
[03:20:22] <Cork> Birliban: you do you're filter through a setTimeout(function() {}, 0) loop
[03:20:34] <Cork> with a function that calls it self through a setTimeout
[03:20:43] <Cork> that way you let the page update while it works
[03:21:01] <Cork> it makes the filtering take quite a bit more time though
[03:21:56] <Birliban> ok, it should be ok to take some more time if the user gets some response.
[03:22:12] <Cork> it doesn't block the ui
[03:22:21] <Cork> thats what the setTimeout is for
[03:22:40] <Birliban> anyway quite weird for me with the setTimeout thingy... ;-) will look for some code @google
[03:22:46] <Birliban> thanks anyway.
[03:23:22] <stardog818> I have a strange problem with the jquery ui dialog component
[03:23:53] <stardog818> on the page I'm using it, the function attached to the OK button works just fine when it first loads
[03:24:04] <stardog818> but I also have part of the page loading via AJAX
[03:24:13] <stardog818> and when that loads, the OK function won't close the box
[03:24:14] <stardog818> but...
[03:24:30] <stardog818> if I hit the X in the top-right corner to close the dialog...
[03:24:30] <Cork> Birliban: http://jsfiddle.net/rSHAy/
[03:24:36] <stardog818> then open it again...
[03:24:40] <stardog818> the OK function works just fine
[03:25:05] <stardog818> actually let me back up a bit
[03:25:17] <Birliban> Cork, oh thats great. Thank you!
[03:25:30] <stardog818> the whole OK function works fine every time, except for the $('#dialogId').dialog('close') part
[03:25:42] <stardog818> all my other logs to the console show thorugh
[03:25:54] <stardog818> it shows the dialog in the right place, and there's only one
[03:26:20] <stardog818> any idea what may be going on here?
[03:26:25] <Cork> Birliban: remember through, its async, so you prob want it to do a filtering, and when its done push the changes to the user
[03:26:53] <Cork> Birliban: then you could make it stop if the user types more stuff and make it quite fluent
[03:27:07] <stardog818> I've tried both having the dialog load in with the new ajax content and keeping it constant
[03:27:14] <Birliban> Cork, ok, i'll test this.
[03:27:18] <thom> stardog818: jsfiddle ?
[03:27:22] <stardog818> ok
[03:28:08] <stardog818> Though I don't know how to give you the AJAX content
[03:28:37] <stardog818> I don't have the site up anywhere except my local machine
[03:35:24] <jax> hello
[03:40:28] <w00tner> does anybody here uses CropZoom ??
[03:42:23] <jax> can i exclude an element from a find?
[03:42:56] <jax> .not(this).
[03:44:55] <jax> can i do something like this? input[class=priority-choice, value=1]:radio
[03:45:36] <jax> nevermind, also found ;) [][]
[03:45:41] <Cork> yes you can use .not
[03:46:04] <Cork> jax: you should never use class as an attribute selector
[03:46:23] <Cork> the dot is for that, and is much faster
[03:46:57] <Cork> (also i recommend using quotes around your values)
[03:47:00] <jax> ok
[03:47:03] <jax> let me rewrite that
[03:47:54] <jax> $(".priority-choice[value='"+value+"']").not(this).prop('checked', false);
[03:47:56] <jax> is that better?
[03:48:26] <Cork> yes
[03:48:51] <jax> thx
[03:49:34] <Cork> jax: btw, you're doing that in a loop or something?
[03:49:51] <jax> no
[03:49:54] <Cork> k
[03:50:02] <jax> http://jsfiddle.net/8YhKR/
[03:50:05] <jax> that's all
[03:50:15] <jax> might be a better way regarding the class names
[03:50:32] <jax> just trying to prevent duplicate priority choices.
[03:58:12] <Cork> jax: http://jsfiddle.net/8YhKR/2/
[04:00:28] <keirlav87> how do you declaratively bind to a plugin specific event with jquery on?
[04:01:37] <Cork> keirlav87: you mean a custom event or what?
[04:02:20] <keirlav87> specifically the hide event of bootstrap modal
[04:04:23] <DukeDrake> hmmm
[04:04:33] <Cork> keirlav87: well depends, the plugin might prefix the event
[04:04:36] <DukeDrake> was there a shorthand for .find() using selectors?
[04:04:52] <Cork> keirlav87: other then that there isn't really a way except targeting the element it starts on
[04:05:02] <Cork> $() ?
[04:05:32] <Cork> DukeDrake: if you mean using find in a selector; you can't
[04:06:03] <Cork> DukeDrake: but give what you want to do and we can most likely make something work
[04:06:16] <DukeDrake> ok
[04:06:51] <DukeDrake> I'm cloning a piece of html and need to fill its divs ... I'm looking for a fast way to address these
[04:07:00] <keirlav87> Cork: sorry, what do you mean by targeting the element
[04:07:22] <DukeDrake> currently I have clonedelement.find("#someid"). ...
[04:13:05] <jax> sorry Cork was cooking lunch. what is the advantage of that approach?
[04:13:45] <faid> Hi, I am new to jquery .. i need some expert advice
[04:14:33] <warden23> G'day, is it possible to use jquery to add a number to a div id.. say you have 2 div's with the name hi-im-a-div and you want it so you can style them seperately.. .then could I make it hi-im-a-div-1
[04:14:57] <warden23> and hi-im-a-div-2
[04:15:45] <faid> I have a multilevel drop down menu.. which when slide right for the most right menu item.... goes outside the page and a scrol bar appears... Instead what i want to do is if it is right end of the page the UL/LI to draw with in the page
[04:15:56] <seutje> warden23: by name u mean ID?
[04:15:58] <mandarks> hey guys: any suggestions for plugins/addons which include the element padding in the width?
[04:16:07] <seutje> warden23: so basically, find duplicate IDs and make them unique?
[04:16:19] <warden23> http://jsfiddle.net/TDb78/1/
[04:16:32] <warden23> I want a way to hide my first div
[04:16:33] <seutje> oh
[04:16:46] <seutje> .userfields_info:first-child ?
[04:16:52] <warden23> so.. display: none.. but because they have same name, they would have a hissy fit
[04:16:55] <seutje> ?ijc
[04:16:58] <warden23> you can do that?
[04:17:16] <seutje> css can
[04:17:27] <warden23> awesome just a sec
[04:18:10] <warden23> cool, how far do the numbers go can I do :third-child etc?
[04:18:31] <seutje> ?g css nth-child
[04:18:32] <b-ot> seutje, CSS3 :nth-child() Selector ‚Üí http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_nth-child.asp
[04:18:40] <seutje> OMG IT LINKED TO W3SCHOOLS
[04:19:17] <warden23> i got the idea though, cheers seutje :)
[04:19:23] <warden23> I*
[04:21:03] <faid> any suggestions for my menus????
[04:27:07] <faid> any one expert with menus here ??
[04:33:28] <keirlav87> so is not possible to declaratively bind to a plugins event with jquery on?
[04:37:24] <Cork> keirlav87: yes, just like any other events
[04:38:04] <keirlav87> how do i target the event though?
[04:38:18] <keirlav87> for example I want to bind to bootstrap modal's hide event
[04:38:21] <Cork> $().on('event-name')
[04:38:54] <Cork> keirlav87: so the event is most likely called 'hide' or 'bootstrap-hide' or 'bootstraphide'
[04:40:02] <jax> why don't you read the manual
[04:40:15] <jax> models -> events -> hide/hidden
[04:40:30] <jax> $('#myModal').on('hidden', function () { ... }
[04:42:19] <seutje> reading docs is so 1998
[04:45:29] <wylie_> hi all, could i ask for some really quick tech help?
[04:46:25] <Cork> ?ask @ wylie_
[04:46:26] <bot-t> wylie_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:46:50] <wylie_> cool, i am typing the Q now
[04:49:11] <wylie_> http://www.spokespedicabs.com  -- on this site, when i scroll, a man flys from left to right , as i scroll....this is my attempt: http://pastebin.com/ym8EVrp2    ....it does not work, so my hope is that every scroll i do, a div moves 1px to the right, like in that firs link ...?
[04:49:43] <wylie_> what should that code be?
[04:52:15] <sulaiman> Helloo
[04:59:50] <Anticom2> hi all
[05:00:01] <Anticom2> could it be, that jsfiddle encounters a problem?
[05:00:17] <Anticom2> i've just inserted html and got {"error": "please use POST request"}
[05:01:42] <shoky> Anticom2: your html probably has a script sending an ajax request?
[05:01:55] <Anticom2> nope, it's a simple select field
[05:02:01] <Anticom2> when i click save / update it works
[05:02:09] <Anticom2> when just clicking run i'm getting that error
[05:02:14] <shoky> link?
[05:04:42] <DEADB33F> In selectors, is it much quicker if the element tag is named as well as the class?  (IE 'div.someclass' as opposed to just '.someclass')
[05:04:48] <DEADB33F> or does it not make a lot of difference?
[05:06:28] <Anticom2> shoky nevermind... was just a quick css test anyway. was to lazy to create a new local file spamming my file system ;)
[05:07:17] <shoky> that's a perfectly fine reason to use jsfiddle
[05:07:31] <shoky> why not share the link
[05:07:40] <shoky> oh no we will see your <select>
[05:14:16] <Mickroz> hello, can somebody help me?
[05:20:43] <Cork> ?ask @ Mickroz

[05:24:25] <Mickroz> i trying to create a userscript, but the table where i need to add, is loaded with jquery, how can i see if it got loaded?

[05:26:36] <Cork> ah
[05:26:47] <Cork> you could listen for the ajax event

[05:28:10] <coachz> Hi, Anyone know of any good open source PHP jQuery grid ?
[05:28:36] <mnus> Google.
[05:29:41] <jrockjiggz> hi, i'm trying to run window.print(); inside document.ready(), but it seems the print window is showing up before images are loaded
[05:29:45] <Mickroz> Cork: don't know how to listen for the ajax event with javascript
[05:30:50] <shoky> jrockjiggz: then maybe you want $(window).load
[05:32:44] <jrockjiggz> shoky: thanks
[05:36:43] <Mickroz> ?.windowUnsafe
[05:36:53] <bot-t> Mickroz, Couldn't find ".windowUnsafe" in jQuery Docs.
[06:02:51] <ewaibel> hi, i'm currently working on a project that is using the jQuery UI Accordion Widget and having a problem when clicking on an image that is on top of a header. when I click the image on the header it seems to fire the 'accordionbeforeactivate' callback BEFORE the click event associated with the image. how can I get around this?
[06:03:02] <Mento> hey guys, I'm working on this little teampage script which shows info in a sidebar per person on click - http://jsfiddle.net/PwjnF/9/ - but it only works once, after clicking all items it doesnt work anymore.. any suggestions?
[06:07:58] <jrockjiggz> shoky: $(window).load() doesnt seem to fire when loading ajax.. any ideAS?
[06:08:32] <shoky> jrockjiggz: what do you mean?
[06:09:19] <jrockjiggz> i get no action when outside ready() or inside
[06:09:27] <jrockjiggz> $(window).load( function(){ ... });
[06:09:48] <jrockjiggz> i'm loading the content as ajax, so maybe it won't fire
[06:10:06] <shoky> no idea what you mean, still
[06:10:20] <shoky> "get no action"
[06:10:26] <shoky> "loading the content as ajax"
[06:10:42] <jrockjiggz> shoky: console.log('hi'); will not show in console
[06:11:09] <shoky> $(window).load  wont run again if you load any new content..
[06:11:15] <shoky> neither will $(document).ready
[06:11:18] <shoky> well
[06:11:25] <shoky> not true
[06:11:34] <jrockjiggz> ready() always will, but i think load will not
[06:11:56] <shoky> ok.. i didnt say you have to exclusively put all your code inside $(window).load ..
[06:12:06] <shoky> including stuff you want to run after content is loaded with ajax
[06:12:14] <shoky> the window has long been loaded
[06:12:17] <shoky> and the DOM has long been ready
[06:12:23] <shoky> is my point
[06:12:23] <jrockjiggz> shoky: i'm trying to ensure images have completed loading before firing a print command
[06:12:45] <shoky> then you need to use the image's load event
[06:12:50] <shoky> images'
[06:13:00] <shoky> afaik
[06:13:27] <jrockjiggz> hmm, yea it seems that will be required
[06:13:28] <shoky> or use some plugin that does that for you
[06:13:45] <misteroneill> Mento: you're writing an element into the HTML of ".teamlid-info" - you should be writing the HTML of that element, so instead of "jQuery('.' + this.id)" do "jQuery('.' + this.id).html();" - also this is generally not a good way of doing this - i'd store the extra information about team members as data attributes possibly.
[06:13:46] <jrockjiggz> cool, thanks
[06:15:49] <Mento> misteroneill thanks for your suggestion, how do you see the extra information as data attributes? the extra info is mostly a short text of bio - like 400/500 characters
[06:18:06] <misteroneill> Mento: it's not strictly necessary but when i fixed the html() issue in the jsfiddle, the bios start showing in the <li> elements
[06:19:43] <Mento> misteroneill: i see, thats because jQuery('.' + this.id).show(); is still there, for testing.. i deleted it now in my code, works like a charm! Thanks
[06:21:58] <aqeel> hi room

[06:23:05] <misteroneill> Mento: here's a somewhat cleaner version - http://jsfiddle.net/ry8Pn/
[06:24:25] <aqeel> i mean have anyone ever used any jquery custom scrollbar plugin, if yes , link to plugin and the setup of its functionality..
[06:24:42] <pmercado> I need to rebind a function if I change their classes  using removeClass|addClass ??
[06:24:53] <shoky> aqeel: see ?g jquery jScrollPane
[06:24:55] <bot-t> aqeel, jScrollPane - cross browser styleable scrollbars with jQuery and CSS - http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[06:25:09] <jrockjiggz> pmercado: live handles that, use on()
[06:25:33] <aqeel> shocky, bot-t thanks
[06:25:38] <pmercado> jrockjiggz: so that mean a "yes"?
[06:26:06] <misteroneill> pmercado: no you shouldn't have to rebind. also have to make sure you're not removing the className that is targeted by .on()
[06:26:12] <jrockjiggz> pmercado: yes, its the same as adding a new element to the dom
[06:27:10] <shoky> only need to worry if you were using delegation in the first place, and the class that you're listening for is the one being removed
[06:28:56] <pmercado> ok thanks =)
[06:28:59] <mnus> hi ~)
[06:29:06] <Mento> misteroneill thanks for you help :)

[07:00:50] <misteroneill> w00tner: i'm not seeing that. i tried it in jsFiddle and it worked alright for me‚Ä¶ in general, when you see "[object Object]" it's because you're calling Object.prototype.toString on an Object
[07:02:05] <Rainbowwwww> nFFF http://jsfiddle.net/x3QDx/3/

[07:12:14] <aivonix> Hi guys. What is the opposite of event.preventDefault ?
[07:12:42] <nFFF> aivonix, the opposite would be default
[07:12:46] <nFFF> ie. do nothing
[07:12:56] <aivonix> how does one unset it then :?
[07:12:59] <aqeel> aivonix:  !event.preventDefault
[07:13:20] <aivonix> :o too simple to be true, thanks
[07:14:27] <misteroneill> you're right, it is‚Ä¶ what are you trying to do that you want "the opposite" of preventDefault?

[08:23:14] * SunChero is looking for a good free opensource comet server (or a free cloud alternative)
[08:28:07] <w00tner> im trying to get a img path using var path = $(this).attr('src');
[08:28:23] <w00tner> it was working but now im getting this [object Object] response
[08:28:42] <tw2113> sounds like you're getting multiple results
[08:28:45] <andrew9184> what does this reference ?
[08:30:00] <mandarks>  alert($(this).html()); and see if you're getting multiple results
[08:30:14] <w00tner> let me see..
[08:30:15] <andrew9184> is there an advantage in appending elements to the html if a condition is satisfied, versus, subtracring elements from the html via remove() if a condition is not satisfied ?
[08:30:26] <tw2113> console.log() > alert()
[08:30:53] <BillCriswell> w00tner: What are you doing with the paths?
[08:31:06] <BillCriswell> Just like.. collecting them all?
[08:31:47] <w00tner> i click the img and get the src attr and append the image to a div
[08:32:09] <w00tner> alert($(this).html());  is blank
[08:32:11] <mandarks> yh but that also includes opening up your dev tools.. quick and dirty, just like a f***
[08:32:48] <mandarks> drop it in a js fiddle

[08:41:24] <Doomground> doing a jquery .get(), and it takes time
[08:41:29] <Doomground> but it's holding other stuff
[08:43:28] <aivonix> Bye! :)
[08:46:02] <Doomground> as i understand from the docs
[08:46:07] <Doomground> .get should be async by default
[08:46:15] <Doomground> why does it hold other requests back...
[08:47:43] <wachpwnski1> .get ?
[08:48:09] <wachpwnski1> Doomground:  how are you calling them?
[08:48:12] <Doomground> rather $.get()
[08:48:13] <Doomground> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[08:48:16] <Doomground> talking about this
[08:48:59] <wachpwnski1> yah, are you calling $.get in a function?
[08:49:09] <wachpwnski1> or in the .ready ?
[08:49:13] <Doomground> in a function
[08:49:31] <wachpwnski1> that's probably why
[08:49:37] <shoky> what makes you say it's holding other requests back
[08:50:09] <wachpwnski1> could also be the request server not concurrently fulfilling requests.
[08:51:00] <Doomground> shoky because i'm watching firebug, and i'm doing 3 other requests after this one
[08:51:04] <Doomground> but the other don't finish up
[08:51:04] <wachpwnski1> at the end of your functions try putting return false;
[08:51:09] <Doomground> before the first one is
[08:51:11] <shoky> anyway it's up to the browser and/or server, not jquery
[08:51:36] <wachpwnski1> shoky++;
[08:52:06] <Doomground>  functions try putting return false; => didn't work
[08:52:10] <wachpwnski1> Doomground:  try taking them out of functions and just putting the $.get in one area
[08:52:15] <wachpwnski1> see if they are asynch
[08:52:17] <Doomground> alright
[08:53:39] <shoky> Doomground: if you see the 3 other requests in firebug.. then they weren't blocked, no?
[08:53:43] <wachpwnski1> shoky: should a $.get request return a deferred anyway? So it doesn't have to wait for a repsonse on the transaction
[08:54:04] <wachpwnski1> or a response to complete the function?
[08:54:13] <Doomground> (18:53:39) <shoky> Doomground: if you see the 3 other requests in firebug.. then they weren't blocked, no? => they are blocked by this query i'm doing with this $.get
[08:54:13] <shoky> wachpwnski1: it returns a jqXHR which is also a promise
[08:54:38] <shoky> you say they dont finish up
[08:54:44] <Doomground> yeah, they don't
[08:54:45] <shoky> thats not.. blocked
[08:54:50] <Doomground> until the $.get finishes
[08:55:00] <Doomground> so they get blocked by the $.get, doesn't they?
[08:55:31] <wachpwnski1> Wait, do they fail after the first get?
[08:55:40] <Doomground> no, they just "wait" until the first get is done
[08:55:42] <Doomground> and then success
[08:55:48] <shoky> i cant know from here.. but as wachpwnski1 suggested, it could be the server only handling one request at a time or something
[08:55:58] <wachpwnski1> did you try putting async: true ?
[08:56:02] <shoky> eh
[08:56:07] <shoky> dont even try that, for any reason
[08:56:13] <shoky> oops
[08:56:14] <Doomground> no, but it should be true by default
[08:56:26] <Doomground> and $.get doesn't have that option afaik
[08:56:26] <shoky> thought you meant false
[08:56:28] <shoky> sry
[08:56:52] <wachpwnski1> I am going to guess it's the api/request server
[08:56:56] <wachpwnski1> server*
[08:57:40] <Doomground> any idea if it's possible to turn it on for apache somehow?
[08:58:04] <wachpwnski1> Is it an api server?
[08:58:22] <Doomground> no, it's an simple apache
[08:59:51] <shoky> pastebin some code, maybe that'll give a clue
[09:00:41] <Doomground> http://pastebin.com/gEi15AfX
[09:00:44] <wachpwnski1> We don't really know what it is, and it doesn't look like a common problem. I am sure if there was a request limit on apache we would see it on google.
[09:00:57] <Doomground> the last $.get
[09:01:05] <shoky> /project/new-pin-email?projectId=
[09:01:08] <Doomground> yeah
[09:01:08] <AL13N_work> c an anyone help me with: http://jsfiddle.net/C5ham/16/
[09:01:09] <shoky> that's simple apache?
[09:01:17] <Doomground> yeah?
[09:01:22] <AL13N_work> this one seems to crash my FF
[09:01:24] <Doomground> simple php script anwsering to that request
[09:01:27] <AL13N_work> and give recursion errors
[09:01:40] <shoky> right..
[09:05:20] <shoky> AL13N_work: havent really looked much at the code but.. in makelist you're calling makelist, unconditionally
[09:05:25] <shoky> i'd call that some deep recursion
[09:05:39] <Doomground> i just don't see why it's blocking other requests
[09:05:45] <Doomground> just doesn't seem logical..
[09:10:17] <shoky> Doomground: check your server logs.. do the 3 other requests hit the server before the first one finishes?  if you log something from your php do you see it logged even before the 1st request is done, etc..
[09:11:00] <shoky> or maybe its just something in your php that is blocking.. db connection shit who knows
[09:11:31] <frantz> Can someone tell me what I need to removed to tone down the easing on my slider? It "bounces" a little, and I only want it to bounce once then stop.. link is at http://sfwebs.net/ternes
[09:14:37] <bananaboydean> could someone help to double check i added a method to a form validator correct? https://gist.github.com/4196426
[09:15:44] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ bananaboydean
[09:15:45] <bot-t> bananaboydean, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[09:15:58] <relipse> does anyone know how i can get the green "Pro Team" to stretch to the edge of the div? http://clearbugs.com/register.php
[09:16:26] <shoky> bananaboydean: in short - by the time the error/success callback is called, the 'return email_exists' has already run long before
[09:16:28] <bananaboydean> shoky: the post works fine, the function doesnt actually get called at all
[09:17:07] <shoky> bananaboydean: sure it gets called, but much later than when the alert or the 'return' is called
[09:17:08] <bananaboydean> that alert doesnt even get called though
[09:17:32] <shoky> sure it does, it just alerts an undefined value
[09:17:57] <bananaboydean> it doesnt no alert pops up
[09:18:11] <shoky> alerts suck anyway. use console.log
[09:18:24] <bananaboydean> thats how i know its not runnign though
[09:18:31] <bananaboydean> and i cant figure out why
[09:18:31] <shoky> use console.log
[09:18:37] <shoky> and look at your javascript console
[09:18:39] <bananaboydean> kk
[09:20:15] <bananaboydean> shoky: even with console.log still nothing
[09:20:22] <bananaboydean> its not running the mthod for some reason
[09:20:27] <bananaboydean> i updated the gist with the full file
[09:28:00] <alpha1125> I'm looking to get the first item based on a class selector‚Ä¶ $('#myClass:first') doesn't seem to work‚Ä¶  cause when I go $('#myClass.first').attr('data-sku') it returns undefined.  When I get it via the "ID", I can find the attr('data-sku').  Any thoughts?
[09:28:52] <ajpiano> alpha1125: $(".myClass").first().attr("data-sku") or $(".myClass:first").attr("data-sku")
[09:28:57] <ajpiano> # is an ID selector
[09:29:01] <ajpiano> every time.
[09:29:42] <alpha1125> I had it as the period (class) selector in the code‚Ä¶ I typed it wrong here.  Let me check again.
[09:31:19] <alpha1125> I'm realizing why now‚Ä¶ this is jqmobi, not jquery...
[09:31:25] <alpha1125> the selector's not implemented properly.
[09:31:27] <alpha1125> <sigh>
[09:31:51] <shoky> bananaboydean: i think you have to use something like-  http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/remote
[09:32:14] <bananaboydean> shoky: ill check it out thank you
[09:33:37] <R00tk3y> Okay if I made a pop up box, like when you click on a header link, and a pop up tab appears, like one google or any other website in the world, how would I make it so when you click outside it closes it
[09:39:36] <wachpwnski1> R00tk3y: focus?
[09:40:04] <Ogredude^> R00tk3y: the event for when an element loses focus is blur
[09:40:17] <Ogredude^> R00tk3y: so you'd set a handler on that element's blur event that hides the elements you want gone
[09:42:04] <wachpwnski1> something like $('#myid').blur( handler );
[10:05:02] <bananaboydean> trying to use remote to check if email is in DB this is my function: https://gist.github.com/4196769
[10:05:14] <moura> any 1 here using spritely ?
[10:05:18] <bananaboydean> seems to only run once then it stops
[10:07:32] <s3d_matt> Afternoonn all, I'm using a query ui Autocomplete with the Select option, so i can populate other fields on select.  Works fine, apart from the field on which the autocomplete is on always reads [object Object] - any ideas?

[10:13:51] <shoky> bananaboydean: and your server script has to output true or false  (the request needs to be successful either way)
[10:13:54] <bananaboydean> shoky: i use http statuses as return values
[10:14:04] <bananaboydean> no php in this
[10:14:07] <s3d_matt> : Afternoonn all, I'm using a query ui Autocomplete with the Select option, so i can populate other fields on select.  Works fine, apart from the field on which the autocomplete is on always reads [object Object] - any ideas?
[10:14:13] <shoky> bananaboydean: that's not how the validator remote thingy is used..
[10:14:38] <Ansikt> When I'm using chrome, console.log($('#id').is(":visible"))  returns false, but in Firefox works fine.  Any idea why this would happen?
[10:14:56] <bananaboydean> shoky: i figured, im using another script to kinda constantly update weather or not the email is in the DB and the validator just checks the value of a gloabal bool
[10:14:58] <Ansikt> Even when it SHOULD be true, that is.
[10:15:17] <shoky> bananaboydean: heh
[10:15:34] <bananaboydean> were trying to not use PHP anywhere in the code
[10:15:49] <tw2113> we're*
[10:15:51] <tw2113> *ducks*
[10:15:58] <shoky> quack
[10:16:17] <tw2113> silly shoky, ducks moo, not quack
[10:16:40] <shoky> meow is hungry
[10:16:57] <shoky> anyway i was referring to you, sir
[10:18:00] <moura> any 1 using or able to help with spritely ?
[10:19:25] <R00tk3y> I can set a blur on a division?
[10:20:01] <R00tk3y> Hey Shoky! Its SmallCode
[10:23:52] <R00tk3y> Shoky
[10:23:53] <R00tk3y> Attention
[10:24:29] <shoky> hy R00tk3y
[10:24:36] <R00tk3y> Its SmallCode!
[10:24:38] <R00tk3y> Remember me!?
[10:24:42] <shoky> you mean handle the blur event on a <div> ?
[10:24:46] <shoky> yea sorta :P
[10:24:51] <R00tk3y> Yeah you can't use blur
[10:24:56] <R00tk3y> those guys don't know CSS very well lol
[10:25:07] <shoky> yea, you can't as far as i remember
[10:25:15] <R00tk3y> Okay go to google
[10:25:18] <R00tk3y> and click the more button
[10:25:30] <R00tk3y> You know how when you click outside, it closes, how would I be able to replicate that?
[10:25:45] <shoky> handle clicks? or mousedown?
[10:25:59] <shoky> on the document, or some container, or whatever
[10:27:47] <wachpwnski1> any click that is not the current div should dismiss open
[10:28:41] <R00tk3y> Yeah I did it on html
[10:28:53] <R00tk3y> But I would have to figure out a way
[10:29:11] <R00tk3y> other than that, because it would close even when I clicked into the div
[10:29:53] <Ansikt> R00tk3y:  Toggle a bool?
[10:29:57] <shoky> R00tk3y: you can check what was clicked..
[10:30:55] <shoky> might wanna check out event.target
[10:31:17] <shoky> and/or event delegation , which i think is what we talked about last time
[10:31:21] <djQuery_> hello
[10:32:03] <docmur> Is it possible to select a element by name rather then id, id would be $("#id"), is there a name syntax
[10:32:29] <zduffy> If I want to find the closest div in a while loop what is the correct syntax? Is this correct? $('#CNum').closest().removeClass('hide')
[10:32:36] <shoky> docmur: name is an attribute, use the attribute selector. $("[name=bla"])
[10:32:44] <wroathe> R00tk3y: You could bind the click handler to document and handle from there
[10:33:41] <wroathe> $(document).on('click', function () { // close panel }); $('.button').on('click', function () { e.stopPropagation(); // open panel });
[10:34:53] <shoky> function(e)  :P
[10:34:57] <Ansikt> Or just have a visibility toggle, and bind it to $('#more_button').click
[10:35:00] <wroathe> sorry
[10:35:01] <wroathe> Yeah
[10:36:51] <shoky> zduffy:  it doesn't make sense to call .closest() with no argument
[10:37:08] <zduffy> do I need a selector?
[10:37:13] <shoky> zduffy: and donno what your code has to do with a while loop..
[10:37:21] <shoky> zduffy: what are you trying to do
[10:37:50] <shoky> in fact it's not part of the API to call it with no argument
[10:38:00] <shoky> ?closest @ zduffy
[10:38:01] <bot-t> zduffy, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[10:38:30] <zduffy> Ok thank you shoky
[10:40:39] <danielwrobert> i c
[10:40:40] <danielwrobert> nice
[10:44:26] <docmur> would it be valid to do $("select").select2();, to apply select2() over all select tags
[10:45:02] <BillCriswell> docmur: It depends heavily on .select2()
[10:54:47] <wachpwnski1> when you use IFFEs can you declare a namespace like (function(ns) { ‚Ä¶ })(myNameSpace); ?
[11:05:00] <NickNack> does anyone know what kinda slider this is or what website is using it so i can snatch it from there. http://imgur.com/DOCVe im trying to find this effect, its like a puzzle hover slider door effect, when you hover over one square it slides over the image behind it if that makes sense...
[11:09:04] <wroathe> wachpwnski1: You'd have to define myNameSpace first
[11:09:26] <wroathe> To pass it in as an argument
[11:10:16] <wroathe> You could do something like (function (ns) { ns.method = function() {} }({}))
[11:11:01] <docmur> why would I get $("select").select2() is not a function when I have select2.js and select2.css included at the top of the page
[11:17:37] <BillCriswell> docmur: It's not a jquery function.
[11:19:18] <djQuery> slow day
[11:19:19] <BillCriswell> (function($){ $.fn.select2 = function(){ ... } })(jQuery); Then this inside that function would be one select element.
[11:19:24] <BillCriswell> djQuery: Sure is.
[11:19:32] <BillCriswell> docmur: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[11:20:24] <docmur> I was able to get it to work in a testscript, http://pastebin.com/hRbehNue  the top code is me testing it and it works, the bottom code gives the error, I'll take a look at that link
[11:22:24] <djQuery> anyone got a tut on jquery-ui unit tests? got something I want to submit but want unit tests to go with it
[11:23:36] <NickNack> does anyone know what kinda slider this is or what website is using it so i can snatch it from there. http://imgur.com/DOCVe im trying to find this effect, its like a puzzle hover slider door effect, when you hover over one square it slides over the image behind it if that makes sense...
[11:26:24] <docmur> ......renameing jquery-1.8.2.js to jquery.js fixed the issue
[11:26:27] <docmur> :S
[11:27:03] <wachpwnski1> wroathe:  if I want to pass in the jQuery and my namspace does (function($, ns) { ‚Ä¶ })(jQuery, myNS); work assuming myNS is defined?
[11:27:29] <wachpwnski1> I am using var myNS = myNS || {};
[11:27:40] <djQuery> NickNack, well from looking at the source its using a file called gallery_js
[11:28:22] <NickNack> lol are you telling me the script imgur is using?
[11:28:45] <wroathe> wachpwnski1: Yeah. That's fine.
[11:28:45] <djQuery> NickNack, http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/
[11:28:56] <wroathe> wachpwnski1: Although I don't know why you'd do it that way...
[11:29:03] <djQuery> NickNack, from looking in the file at that point
[11:29:42] <wroathe> I'd define my namespace inside of that self executing function and then expose it at the end with something like window.myNS = myNS;
[11:30:33] <NickNack> its not jcarousel...
[11:31:15] <BillCriswell> NickNack: http://www.2meter3.de/jqPuzzle/?
[11:31:15] <djQuery> NickNack, oh you mean we were supposed to tell from just that image what carosel\slider its using instead ofgiving us a link to the site that had it
[11:31:41] <BillCriswell> I hate these puzzles.
[11:31:59] <BillCriswell> NickNack: http://www.bennadel.com/resources/demo/jquery_puzzle/
[11:32:29] <NickNack> its not a puzzle
[11:32:29] <BillCriswell> NickNack: Google "jquery puzzle slider"
[11:32:48] <NickNack> although i do love those puzzles
[11:32:55] <NickNack> i did google it
[11:33:03] <NickNack> for likr 3 hours
[11:33:06] <BillCriswell> NickNack: Haha.
[11:33:42] <BillCriswell> I don't know what it's supposed ot do then
[11:34:16] <NickNack> ihate these stupid client request -_-
[11:34:24] <tw2113> they never end
[11:35:25] <NickNack> BillCriswell: its close to this http://codecanyon.net/item/brick-slide-rotator-textual-or-graphical-menu/full_screen_preview/161004
[11:35:29] <BillCriswell> NickNack: What happens when I hover over a tile? It just slides in like.. any direction?
[11:35:44] <NickNack> yeah it slides in a different direction
[11:35:49] <BillCriswell> NickNack: The first demo?
[11:35:53] <NickNack> i need to find that damn site -_-
[11:35:57] <NickNack> demo 5
[11:36:05] <NickNack> except theres no hover
[11:36:12] <NickNack> but you see how the tiles move
[11:36:45] <BillCriswell> So when you hover over something you want to trigger this effect?
[11:37:30] <NickNack> when i hover over one tile it slides the tile to a differnt image
[11:38:28] <BillCriswell> So each tile that's hovered triggers one large image to basically show up?
[11:39:03] <NickNack> each tile that hovers over switches that tile to the image behind it, it never actually shows the full image
[11:40:24] <BillCriswell> You mean sort of just like changing the background image?
[11:40:53] <NickNack> i guess you can say that
[11:42:01] <BillCriswell> li:hover { background-image: url("foo.png"); }  ?
[11:42:41] <NickNack> yeah i was thinking of tstartiing with something like that incase i have to create this myself
[11:43:36] <BillCriswell> What more do you need besides the hover? The slide action?
[11:43:50] <NickNack> yeah i know the slide action though
[11:44:11] <NickNack> might be easier for me just to redo it =/
[11:44:27] <NickNack> but then again if i can find that site i wont have to =)
[11:48:05] <BillCriswell> NickNack: http://jsbin.com/irirek/1/edit like this basically?
[11:48:16] <JAAulde> Why is jQuery adding "display: block" to the button in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/mYaEV/8/ ?
[11:48:57] <NickNack> BillCriswell: hmm with a little bit of tweaking this could possibly work. I appreciate it!
[11:49:29] <BillCriswell> NickNack: No problem. This is done with CSS3 so depending on how much you have to support you'll probably have to look into $.animate()
[11:50:12] <NickNack> yeah, thank you again
[11:50:17] <JAAulde> to be more clear without require a click on the link, why would jQuery put an inline style of "display: block" on a button when calling .show() thereupon? http://jsfiddle.net/mYaEV/8/
[11:51:06] <BillCriswell> NickNack: Welcome.
[11:51:20] <JAAulde> calling .hide().show() on a button which is already in the DOM results in a display of inline-block. but building a button which is hidden, appending to the DOM, and later calling .show() results in a display of block
[11:57:49] <veQue> i have a string 1,000 but when i add it to the other string 3 i get 4...not 1,003 like i should
[11:57:59] <veQue> how do i get it to ignore commas?
[11:58:14] <BillCriswell> veQue: parseInt()
[11:58:43] <veQue> not parseFloat?
[11:58:55] <BillCriswell> Actually.. hmm.
[11:59:00] <BillCriswell> Guess you will need to remove them.
[11:59:10] <veQue> the commas..
[11:59:19] <veQue> i guess it'll be easier that way
[11:59:26] <veQue> i'd like to keep them though if possible
[11:59:47] <veQue> i am using a number formatter script which adds them
[12:00:14] <BillCriswell> parseInt( '1,000'.replace(/\,/g. ''), 10)
[12:00:31] <BillCriswell> Wait, shoudl have tried that first haha
[12:00:43] <BillCriswell> parseInt( '1,000'.replace(/\,/g, ''), 10)
[12:01:19] <veQue> ok will that work if the number 1,000 is really dynamic
[12:01:26] <veQue> like 1,000 was my example
[12:01:36] <veQue> but it can be 2,000 or 1,000,000
[12:01:40] <veQue> etc
[12:01:44] <BillCriswell> veQue: That's fine.
[12:01:59] <veQue> ok
[12:02:02] <veQue> i'll try it
[12:02:09] <BillCriswell> It has the /g so it'll remove all occurrences of ,
[12:02:25] <BillCriswell> veQue: When you want to add commas back you'll need to use something like http://www.mredkj.com/javascript/numberFormat.html#addcommas
[12:03:11] <veQue> ok i think i have something like that already
[12:03:26] <veQue> maybe i'll use your example
[12:08:47] <dns-away> anyone for simple mysql help
[12:09:51] <BillCriswell> dns-away: Nothing in #mysql?
[12:10:19] <veQue> BillCriswell:  thanks it worked
[12:10:24] <veQue> hahah
[12:10:25] <BillCriswell> veQue: Sweeeet.
[12:10:30] <veQue> the littliest things
[12:10:41] <veQue> can unnerve me so much
[12:10:53] <veQue> it took a while to even figure out why my values wer wrong
[12:11:46] <BillCriswell> veQue: Happens. Luckily computers help you figure out that kind of shit fast.
[12:15:32] <microhxo> Guys, how do i pass a GUID into a function as a parameter?   http://paste2.org/p/2557441
[12:17:24] <microhxo> it can be a string representation of a guid, i just am unable to send it period..
[12:17:38] <microhxo> SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal
[12:19:35] <jrockjiggz> $( function(){ el.offset(); )}); is giving a different number then when i run offset() in console... ....
[12:19:45] <jrockjiggz> i have no explination.. I can even see the element is at a different position when the page loads
[12:20:05] <s34n_> How can I use a responsive design to have the effect of jq-mobile's data-inline="true" on a button for screens that are wider?
[12:27:24] <gutto> microhxo: why won't you bind onclick event via $(element).click(function(guid) { ReservationCareOption.excludeProviderClicked(guid); return false;  }) ?
[12:28:14] <microhxo> That part wasn't written by me, im just fixing an issue with the current implementation.
[12:40:05] <initself> if i have two numbers, can i just added them together like this? customer_cols_start + i
[12:40:13] <initself> or do i need an object to do addition?
[12:40:21] <donburks> No, you can just add them together.
[12:40:30] <initself> i'm getting all zeros when i try.
[12:40:38] <initself> $("#customer_cytd_order_net_ext_sums").html(sumOfColumns("tablesorter", customer_cols_start + i, true, "float"));
[12:40:45] <initself> maybe it's concatenating?
[12:40:59] <donburks> If they're strings, and they're both 0, sure.
[12:41:06] <donburks> But then you would get "00"
[12:41:16] * initself tests.
[12:41:20] <donburks> Log out the values for them before that line of code, verify what they are.
[12:41:48] <donburks> If you want to force numbers, run it through parseInt(): parseInt(customer_cols_start,10) for example
[12:44:28] <initself> thanks, i was doing something else stupid.
[12:44:30] <initself> donburks++
[12:44:39] <donburks> Np.
[12:49:33] <katsh> if on an ajax callback function (ie, success : function(data) {..}), data is a json in the format {'success' : 'some message'}, how do i get the key of the json object?
[12:50:07] <katsh> data.success gives 'some message'. but how do i get the string that is the key ('success')
[12:50:15] <shoky> katsh just like with any other js object
[12:50:36] <shoky> a for-each loop, or $.each would do the trick
[12:50:48] <shoky> i meant, a for..in loop
[12:51:20] <hugo_moss> hi i have a series of asynchronous animations that relay on the order in which theyre executed, i didn't even think that animations were asynchronous until i found out. how would i solve this?
[12:51:23] <hugo_moss> promises?
[12:51:32] <hugo_moss> relay=rely
[12:51:47] <shoky> yes, probably
[12:51:55] <katsh> do i have to use a loop? seems overkill.  i simply want to perform actions based on the key
[12:52:02] <katsh> a simple if
[12:52:17] <hugo_moss> shoky, you talking to me or katsh?
[12:52:23] <shoky> hugo_moss: to you
[12:52:27] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[12:52:31] <hugo_moss> is that the only way to solve it?
[12:52:50] <hugo_moss> what if you wanted to do this before jquery 1.5
[12:53:22] <shoky> hugo_moss: the animations have a 'finished' callback
[12:54:00] <shoky> katsh: a simple if that checks what?
[12:54:25] <hugo_moss> right the callbacks
[12:55:02] <hugo_moss> but i have an if statement, that has a call to 4 animations,  each proceeding animation is placed in the preceedings callback
[12:55:16] <hugo_moss> but thats inside a function
[12:55:21] <hugo_moss> after that function executes
[12:55:41] <hugo_moss> then i do a call to some other function that has to be executed after those animations are all done
[12:56:25] <hugo_moss> how can you place the function after the animation, in their callback?
[12:56:35] <hugo_moss> i want it inside the original body
[12:56:48] <hugo_moss> you know what im saying shoky
[13:00:12] <shoky> not really ;]
[13:00:21] <hugo_moss> heh
[13:00:25] <shoky> but we both agree,
[13:00:28] <shoky> promises are the way to go :P
[13:00:33] <hugo_moss> yea
[13:00:45] <hugo_moss> now i can just return from a fadeout function
[13:00:52] <hugo_moss> and create a promise var
[13:00:59] <hugo_moss> and then use done then when on that
[13:01:10] <shoky> you can also instad of calling $(...).animate
[13:01:27] <shoky> call $.Animation(...)  which already returns a promise for that animation
[13:02:31] <shoky> see https://gist.github.com/54829d408993526fe475
[13:02:36] <hugo_moss> (...) is the selector?
[13:02:57] <shoky> jQuery.Animation( element, props, opts )
[13:03:25] <TelFiRE> Hey. Is there a plugin for dissolve transition? Basically dissolve into a powder to show the next slide
[13:07:02] <hugo_moss> i could use fadeOut(1500).promise()
[13:09:51] <Rchristiani> I have a question about delegate, fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/mvSrT/7/ , I am trying to delegate the click event to some elements and then get the closest specifc parent elements, but I am having trouble getting it to work. What am I missing here?
[13:09:56] <hugo_moss> or $.when($(..).fadein()).done
[13:12:14] <misteroneill1> Rchristiani: looks like you're calling ".delegate.(" - extra dot in there?
[13:12:56] <shoky> hugo_moss: yes but you have less control that way, it'll be the promise for 'all animations completed' , not just the current animation you just added
[13:13:12] <shoky> (all animations on that element)
[13:13:35] <Rchristiani> misteroneill1:opppps, now I feel stupic
[13:13:50] <Rchristiani> stupid (typing pro)
[13:13:51] <misteroneill1> Rchristiani: no worries - happens to everyone :)
[13:14:12] <shoky> and then we look at the console ;p
[13:15:28] <Rchristiani> yeah, well that works there, but on a site I am working on it seems to still not work, will .closest() traverse till it find the selector? or is there a certain level it will stop?
[13:15:44] <shoky> won't stop
[13:15:51] <Rchristiani> hmmm
[13:15:58] <Rchristiani> ok, maybe I have something else going on!
[13:15:58] <Rchristiani> Thanks
[13:16:15] <shoky> uhm
[13:16:32] <shoky> it'll traverse _up_ the dOM tree, that is
[13:16:50] <Rchristiani> yeah
[13:22:06] <TelFiRE> Any way to achieve a dissolve effect? Individual pixels spreading apart like dust?
[13:23:51] <phpn00b> hi I am kinda new with JQuery I want to generate an autocomplete form
[13:24:58] <phpn00b> I got jquery-ui and jquery-autocomplete
[13:25:55] <Rchristiani> TelFiRE: I suspect you might be looking at some kinds of Canvas solution for that
[13:41:38] <TrentonDAdams> I have an interesting issue.  I'm registering a change event with a snippet of HTML loaded via jquery/ajax.  That snippet replaces an entire div.  If I keep loading that div snippet over and over again via ajax, it keeps registering the onchange again, for the same element.  I would have expected that with a 'replace' of the div, all javascript associations with the element would go away, and I would get a "new" one.  Is this not the case?
[13:41:52] <Rchristiani> Ok I think my issue is my understanding of the relationship of elements, fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/mvSrT/17/ , what would the relationship between .button and .box? I assume Siblings?
[13:44:23] <misteroneill1> Rchristiani: not really - .button is a child of a sibling of .box
[13:44:58] <misteroneill1> try $(this).parent().prev().fadeIn()
[13:45:32] <xyphen> Any workaround for #12827?
[13:47:41] <alaing> hey ppl
[13:47:50] <alaing> anyone know of a few good widget factory tutorials?
[13:48:15] <donburks> Widget factory for...?
[13:48:33] <alaing> jQuery UI Widget Factory
[13:48:44] <donburks> Ah. Sorry, none that jump to mind.
[13:48:49] <donburks> I'd Google.
[13:48:49] <Rchristiani> Misteroniell1: That is it thanks!
[13:49:06] <alaing> I did google some but still rather confused
[13:56:57] <mcoffee> Is .data() good for storing DOM elements that I absolutely don't want being on the HTML tree?
[14:02:41] <veQue> C=A+B aka A=C-B aka B=C-A    how can i get C =A+B if i dont have A yet?
[14:02:58] <veQue> i know this makes no sense
[14:03:22] <Ogredude> veQue: your second statement has it. A = C - B
[14:03:31] <veQue> yes that's the thing
[14:03:38] <Ogredude> if you don't have C and B yet, then get moar infos
[14:03:51] <veQue> how can i tell the computer i will have A  ?
[14:04:03] <veQue> a will be inputed?
[14:04:13] <veQue> sorry A will be inputted.
[14:14:44] <veQue> basically i need to say sometimes a will be calculated but sometimes it will be inputted by the user.
[14:14:55] <veQue> lets use AA
[14:15:04] <veQue> a gets confusing
[14:15:38] <veQue> so maybe i need to set som flags
[14:16:13] <veQue> so know whne to use a formula and when to not?
[14:17:25] <veQue> hmm i think i can do this
[14:19:25] <xyphen> Any workaround for "#12827: REMOVE "EXCLUSIVE" EVENTS" (http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12827?
[14:20:30] * xyphen guess there's none
[14:20:44] * xyphen guesses there's none*
[14:25:52] <zduffy> I have an issue with my radio buttons. I need to select the current record and not the first one. I know its a selector issue but I need help. This data is from a while loop so they all have the same selector name. http://jsfiddle.net/v3ds4/
[14:27:02] <donburks> zduffy: You can only have one unique ID per page. So, if you have multiple radio buttons with the same ID, you will have a problem.
[14:28:16] <veQue> i think i figured it out =D
[14:28:19] <veQue> lol
[14:28:20] <zduffy> So how do I make them with a different ID. Im confused lol. donburks
[14:28:27] <veQue> i'll just do every instance
[14:29:12] <donburks> zduffy: append a number to the end of the ID. #radio1 #radio2, etc.
[14:29:52] <zduffy> then what would I change the selector for move class so it selects the current record and not the first? donburks
[14:30:15] <zduffy> remove*
[14:31:26] <donburks> Honestly, zduffy, I would change them from id's to classes. Then do a .siblings('.selector') to remove the class.
[14:31:44] <zduffy> Ok. Thank you donburks. :)
[14:56:33] <zduffy> in a while loop how can I add 1 to each iteration?
[15:02:13] <BD--> I use "var gallery = <?php echo json_encode( $t_images ) ?>;" to turn a php muti-dimentional array into a js object... problem is that I of course loose the order of the items in the array that way; they just become properties of the object
[15:02:32] <BD--> Is there any way I can turn this into a javascript multi-dimentional array instead, keeping the original order ?
[15:05:19] <RingtailedFox> tw2113, i got that TOC thing working... my only question is.. how do i tell it to not be so damned wide? :P
[15:05:25] <RingtailedFox> it's liek.. 300px wide :P
[15:05:41] <tw2113> css?
[15:18:03] <RingtailedFox> tw2113: i tried setting it to 150px and it did nothing
[15:20:10] <RingtailedFox> i fear it may be hardcoded into the script
[15:20:59] <tw2113> check the source code
[15:21:29] <RingtailedFox> i shall
[15:21:47] <tw2113> looking at it with firebug: <div id="table-of-contents" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; display: block; width: 30%; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; font-size: 10px;">
[15:22:30] <tw2113> http://explosion-pills.com/development/jquery/plugins/headerlinks/#headerlinks_ident11
[15:23:01] <tw2113> http://explosion-pills.com/development/jquery/plugins/headerlinks/#headerlinks_ident13
[15:23:12] <tw2113> RingtailedFox,
[15:23:39] <RingtailedFox> ick
[15:23:40] <RingtailedFox> hold on
[15:24:25] <RingtailedFox> where is this?
[15:24:25] <tw2113> woo plugin settings
[15:25:02] <tw2113> it'd be in your .headerlinks() spot
[15:25:10] <RingtailedFox> in head.php?
[15:25:15] <tw2113> wherever you put it
[15:25:35] <RingtailedFox> mkay
[15:26:16] <tw2113> by guess...
[15:26:17] <RingtailedFox> all that's there is <script type="text/javascript">
[15:26:18] <RingtailedFox> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[15:26:18] <RingtailedFox>         $("#table-of-contents").headerlinks();
[15:26:18] <RingtailedFox> });
[15:26:18] <RingtailedFox> </script>
[15:26:32] <tw2113> meaning it's using all the default parameters
[15:26:37] <tw2113> nothing custom from you
[15:26:57] <dogarrhea> is there an easy way to find out what functions are called when an element is clicked?
[15:27:05] <RingtailedFox> alrighty... so i have to find the js file and edit it?
[15:27:14] <tw2113> my guess RingtailedFox: .headerlinks({ css: { 'width': '30%' , 'border': '1px solid black' , 'padding': '10px' , 'font-size': '10px' } });
[15:27:26] <RingtailedFox> put that in the CSS file?
[15:27:26] <tw2113> no, you change the .headerlinks() part that you added
[15:27:32] <RingtailedFox> oh ok
[15:27:48] <tw2113> don't forget to actually change the css parts in that
[15:27:53] <tw2113> i copy/pasted the defaults
[15:28:01] <RingtailedFox> of coruse
[15:28:02] <RingtailedFox> thanks
[15:31:00] <RingtailedFox> can i remove the ' things? i replaced 30% with 150px, but it did nothing
[15:42:41] <burg> hello. is it possible to apply a jqueryui theme only to datepicker and use custom css for tabs?
[15:48:28] <jquery> burg, - yes, it is possible .)
[16:11:56] <andrew9184> I used the Plugin method to define a bunch of defaults and merge them into options
[16:12:08] <andrew9184> however when I try to reference those options as in options.foobar
[16:12:31] <andrew9184> it says options are undefined.  how do I call back to the Plugin and access the options object ?
[16:28:18] <Westie> uhm... quick question
[16:28:39] <Westie> is it possible
[16:29:00] <Westie> to see what HTMLScriptElement is responsible for loading a script?
[16:29:01] <ericelliott> anything is possible.
[16:29:23] <ericelliott> Except for that.
[16:29:31] <Westie> ah ha1
[16:29:33] <gear4> it's possible
[16:29:33] <ericelliott> I'm kidding. I don't know.
[16:30:03] <gear4> it's 5000% possible
[16:30:03] <Westie> gear4: how? or is it "it's possible, however it's batshit crazy"
[16:30:07] <gear4> but we dunno how
[16:30:20] <gear4> and yes, batshit crazy
[16:31:01] <Westie> grr
[16:31:04] <Westie> thanks guys :)
[16:31:09] <gear4> ^^ gnight
[16:31:11] <shoky> Westie
[16:31:32] <Westie> hello!
[16:31:49] <Westie> yes?
[16:32:09] <shoky> Westie: when the scripts are loaded, the current script running will be the last one, so $('script').last() maybe ;P
[16:32:31] <shoky> tho when talkin about dynamic shit...
[16:32:49] <shoky> then the question starts to get more vague
[16:32:49] <Westie> only thing I can think of is by looking for a hook
[16:32:57] <Westie> or a domain
[16:33:11] <shoky> wha?
[16:33:22] <Westie> $("script[src *= domain.com]")
[16:33:46] <shoky> donno what that has to do with your q but ok
[16:34:53] <Westie> well... quite a lot
[16:34:54] <Westie> :p
[16:35:08] <Westie> ah ha!
[16:35:09] <shoky> maybe with another q that you have in mind, not with the one you asked ;]
[16:35:11] <Westie> document.currentScript!
[16:35:29] <BackEndCoder> hi
[16:35:36] <BackEndCoder> this is my first day with jquery
[16:35:59] <BackEndCoder> i am trying to use jquery to open up another page from inside a div
[16:36:02] <BackEndCoder> i got this working
[16:36:22] <BackEndCoder> but now i need to do it on lots of divs on the front page, to open lots of different other pages
[16:36:26] <shoky> Westie: that'll get you the same thing as my solution, i think
[16:36:37] <BackEndCoder> someone told me i could use rel= as a value to help keep my code DRY
[16:36:43] <BackEndCoder> but it doesn't seem to be working
[16:36:51] <shoky> if that's even supported everywhere
[16:36:55] <BackEndCoder> does anyone have some good examples for the correct way to do this ?
[16:37:37] <shoky> yea thats not supported anywhere hardly, Westie
[16:37:50] <BackEndCoder> my example of my attempt is here http://jsfiddle.net/PfJm3/1/
[16:37:57] <BackEndCoder> but its not quite doing what its ment to do
[16:38:14] <Westie> okay! so it appears currentScript is not supported on chrome
[16:38:21] <shoky> nor IE
[16:38:47] <Westie> it'll have to be $("script:last") then
[16:39:14] <Westie> (or whatever it'd be in standard DOM... having to use that >_>)
[16:39:23] <tw2113> BackEndCoder, i would think data-attributes would better if you're trying to store string data without it showing to the user
[16:39:30] <tw2113> i think rel has different meaning
[16:46:12] <BackEndCoder> if i was able to extend the href
[16:46:20] <BackEndCoder> to allow me to have a unique value
[16:46:21] <shoky> BackEndCoder: for starters, you have many elements with the same id
[16:46:22] <BackEndCoder> that would be awesome
[16:46:29] <shoky> BackEndCoder: id's need to be unique
[16:47:03] <BackEndCoder> i should change the paging div's to classes
[16:47:05] <BackEndCoder> i think
[16:47:23] <BackEndCoder> but the correct way of doing what i wanna do is what i am after atm
[16:47:34] <BackEndCoder> maybe data-attributes are the way forward
[16:47:37] <BackEndCoder> it is html5 at the end of the day
[16:47:44] <BackEndCoder> how can i pull that with js ?

[16:49:01] <shoky> BackEndCoder: .data('rel')  if you called it data-rel

[16:50:20] <shoky> good on ya
[16:50:44] <misteroneill> lizardbrain: jquery doesn't have an "onclick" method. try "on" instead
[16:51:06] <shoky> lizardbrain: or change onclick to click
[16:51:20] <misteroneill> that too
[16:51:32] <lizardbrain> right i knew that

[16:52:28] <veQue> hey what is (A - B)/(-1) ?
[16:52:42] <veQue> it's not (-A + B )  is it?

[17:06:26] <BackEndCoder> ok so
[17:06:27] <BackEndCoder> http://jsfiddle.net/UNjHC/1/
[17:06:35] <BackEndCoder> this is my new version using data attrutubes
[17:06:40] <BackEndCoder> but it does the same thing as it did before
[17:06:55] <BackEndCoder> do you think i might be missing something else, maybe around the $url area
[17:07:14] <burg> veQue: it is -A+B
[17:07:18] <BackEndCoder> or is my useage of 'this' and how i am trying to name the div to refesh is wrong ?
[17:08:13] <veQue> burg:  so (A-B )/( -1 )  is the same as (A-B )*(-1) ?
[17:08:41] <veQue> ?eval(A - B )*(-1)
[17:08:43] <bot-t> veQue, XML Broken on IE 7 and Opera 9.23 with jquery version 1.2.1 - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1890

[17:08:49] <bot-t> veQue: ReferenceError: A is not defined
[17:09:54] <burg> veQue: anything / something is actually anything * (1 / something). so (A-B) / -1 is (A-B) * (1/-1)
[17:10:00] <shoky> BackEndCoder: it doesnt work on the fiddle because it's a cross-domain request
[17:10:19] <BackEndCoder> so technicly
[17:10:25] <BackEndCoder> it should work on the website ? :P
[17:10:35] <veQue> ?eval 4/ (-1)
[17:10:35] <bot-t> veQue: -4
[17:10:45] <veQue> ?eval 4 * (-1)
[17:10:45] <bot-t> veQue: -4
[17:10:49] <veQue> o_O
[17:10:50] <shoky> BackEndCoder: if it's the same domain as what you're loading, yea
[17:10:51] * coldhead learns arithmetic
[17:10:55] <veQue> omg
[17:11:14] <veQue> i just doesnt make sense
[17:11:20] <veQue> it
[17:12:17] <shoky> BackEndCoder: but.. i see you're replacing for example #competitions which contains in it the .paging with the links.. after you replace it, the click handlers will stop working
[17:12:25] <shoky> for elements inside #competitions
[17:12:54] <veQue> so burg any time i see a -1 wheter its mutiplied or divide i can pretty much use it the same way?
[17:13:20] <veQue> *mind blown*
[17:13:56] <burg> veQue: yes, it will change the sign of the other member of the operation
[17:13:57] <shoky> BackEndCoder: to solve that you should use event delegation like:  $('.box').on('click', '.paging a', function() { ... })
[17:16:29] <shoky> veQue: why doesn't make sense.. it makes sense for 1, no?
[17:17:39] <shoky> or did that just blow your mind again ;p
[17:17:48] <coldhead> sign is different to magnitude
[17:18:54] <shoky> who told you that
[17:18:59] <veQue> shoky: i guess that's a good point
[17:19:26] <shoky> it's a moot point, really ;p
[17:19:40] <shoky> ask coldhead, he knows all about moot
[17:19:42] <veQue> well it helps me accept it, that's all that matters
[17:19:43] <shoky> and vegemite

[17:44:31] <djbpython> how can i create a selector to select a :hidden input with a particular id?
[17:44:42] <djbpython> $(':hidden#foo') doesnt seem to work
[17:46:30] <donburks> If it has an id, you just do $("#id")
[17:46:39] <donburks> It doesn't matter if it's hidden or not.
[18:23:51] <bbt> i'm using jquery ui tabs, and i have noticed that if i click on one of the tabs before the sharethis social box loads the the jquery ui tabs go haywire.
[18:24:20] <bbt> is it possible to disable clicks specifically on the tabs until the social box fully loads?
[18:36:59] <Rchristiani> I am having the hardest time trying to figure out how hide one element when you click to on another that shows a similar element, fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/YnSqK/10/ , click a button show a div click the other button, trying to close first div and show the other, any tips?
[18:38:03] <Rchristiani> That was rife with some typos, but I hope it makes sense.
[18:38:58] <ryanneufeld> Rchristiani: try explaining that again
[18:39:23] <Rchristiani> Yeah for sure
[18:39:27] <ryanneufeld> Rchristiani: when I click on each blue box, I get a larger black box above it
[18:39:46] <ryanneufeld> clicking the same box, hides the corresponding black box
[18:40:03] <Rchristiani> Yup, there are 2 blue boxes and 2 black boxes
[18:40:47] <ryanneufeld> k, so what is it doing/not doing you don't/do want it to do?
[18:40:53] <Rchristiani> I am trying to figure out how when you click blue box one and show that first black box, then when you click blue box 2 it would hide blue box 1
[18:41:27] <Rchristiani> Basically like checking to see if the other is showing, if it is close it
[18:41:32] <ryanneufeld> OH
[18:41:33] <Rchristiani> Does that make sense?
[18:41:37] <ryanneufeld> I think so
[18:41:52] <ryanneufeld> kinda like this: http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[18:42:45] <Rchristiani> oh yeah, exactly, but, my example might be misleading, those black boxes would be modal windows
[18:43:08] <Rchristiani> But the same idea, don't thin I grasp the concept of how to check and then close
[18:43:18] <Rchristiani> think*(typing!!)
[18:48:18] <ryanneufeld> Rchristiani: you were very close
[18:49:26] <ryanneufeld> Rchristiani: http://jsfiddle.net/YnSqK/11/
[18:49:53] <Rchristiani> ahhhhh
[18:49:57] <Rchristiani> So easy
[18:50:09] <Rchristiani> Thanks!
[18:50:15] <ryanneufeld> yup

[18:55:11] <gasull> Hi.  I have a page with several Bootstrap modal windows that open when clicking on some links on the page.  Now I want to link to those modal windows from another page.  I know this can be done with Backbone.js.  Is there a way I can do this without refactoring everything to use Backbone?
[18:56:10] <RyanD> gasull: When I needed to do this, pass in a hash to the URL, check for the hash on the target page, and spawn modal based on passed-in hash.
[18:57:32] <gasull> RyanD: thanks. I see.  if window.location.hash, right?
[18:57:41] <veQue> when i click inside a text input i want the caret to move to the far right no matter where i clicked
[18:57:50] <RyanD> gasull: yep.
[18:58:04] <gasull> RyanD: great, thanks
[18:58:09] <RyanD> I'm not necessarily saying that's the best way, that's just what I did when doing that same deal in bootstrap (in my case, it was with the tabs)

[19:03:34] <veQue> you know how you type on a calculator it just adds
[19:03:40] <veQue> adds a digit
[19:03:57] <veQue> to the right
[19:09:00] <BillCriswell> veQue: You can make it read only. I'm not sure you can get that much control with the cursor.
[19:09:45] <veQue> hmm i'm looking at a plugin right now
[19:10:32] <veQue> https://github.com/garyharan/jQuery-caret-utilities
[19:12:15] <BillCriswell> veQue: It looks promising. I'm just always hesitant about messing with those kinds of things.
[19:20:11] <veQue> the best way to use a pug in is to just cop and paste the plugin code into my js ?
[19:20:19] <veQue> bah typing
[19:20:53] <beachandbytes> or just include the plugin file
[19:21:15] <veQue> include it in my index.html or my js?
[19:21:40] <veQue> <script src="js/jquery.caret.js"></script> i know about including things in the html file like so
[19:21:53] <mnus> yes
[19:21:56] <mnus> i prefer that
[19:22:21] <veQue> but will it be possible for my other .js file to reach it?
[19:22:38] <beachandbytes> yes
[19:22:55] <veQue> wow
[19:22:59] <veQue> i did not know that
[19:23:36] <veQue> so i just have to make sure the plugin is on a line above my js file?

[19:57:09] <veQue> somehow it's becoming focused
[19:57:22] <veQue> only text inputs should glow
[19:58:42] <nachooo> Hello, does anyone knows how to handle callbacks using Reveal from Zurb Foundation?
[20:00:55] <snover> i heard there was a field in here
[20:01:37] <coldhead> quit gawking at the yokels, snovesy
[20:01:45] <vladikoff> nachooo, you might have to write that yourself
[20:02:08] <nachooo> vladikoff: I don't mind that, but I have a problem that I don't have a clue how to do it
[20:02:33] <nachooo> vladikoff: because the plugin works without calling it, I don't have any selectors, so‚Ä¶ without selectors I don't know when to trigger the event
[20:03:04] <vladikoff> nachooo, read this https://github.com/zurb/reveal/pull/43
[20:03:05] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Pull request on reveal by alettieri (10m, 1w ago): Callback Events
[20:03:11] <vladikoff> nachooo, or this https://github.com/zurb/reveal/pull/26
[20:03:12] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Pull request on reveal by ReactiveMedia (1y, 2m ago): Added Animation Callbacks
[20:04:01] <vladikoff> veQue, that's probably CSS, you need to specify input type
[20:04:37] <vladikoff> veQue, input[type="button"] in css, or $('[type=checkbox]') in jquery
[20:05:09] <nachooo> vladikoff: I've seen that, it's old, there are some callbacks events already on the current Reveal version
[20:05:34] <veQue> yeh that's the right selector but I am trying to figure out how to prevent it from obtaining focus
[20:06:56] <vladikoff> nachooo, ohh weird, they have the old version for download, the newest version is in Foundation, sorry one sec
[20:07:42] <nachooo> vladikoff: this is the current one https://github.com/zurb/reveal/blob/master/jquery.reveal.js
[20:07:51] <vladikoff> nachooo, no
[20:08:03] <nachooo> vladikoff: I'm using the data-reveal-id to call the modals
[20:08:26] <nachooo> vladikoff: so‚Ä¶ no idea how to add the callbacks now
[20:08:28] <vladikoff> nachooo, that file is a year old, this is the current one https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/vendor/assets/javascripts/foundation/jquery.foundation.reveal.js
[20:08:50] <nachooo> vladikoff: yes, you right
[20:08:56] <nachooo> vladikoff: well, I'm using that one
[20:09:10] <nachooo> vladikoff:  I thought it was the same without documentation
[20:10:12] <vladikoff> nachooo, here you go https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/vendor/assets/javascripts/foundation/jquery.foundation.reveal.js#L93
[20:10:33] <nachooo> vladikoff: yes, exactly‚Ä¶ how do I use that
[20:10:48] <nachooo> vladikoff: I'm not calling reveal() anywhere
[20:12:03] * veQue wishes he had one more video card
[20:12:47] <vladikoff> nachooo, ok sec
[20:15:54] <veQue> wait i have a hdmi
[20:16:08] <veQue> bunone of my monitors do
[20:16:11] <veQue> none
[20:16:11] <PaKScripT> anyone fimiliar with jquery progress bars?? I'm having some trouble -- cant seem to find the 80% complete in the script. -- need to remove it.
[20:19:53] <vladikoff> nachooo, I think you might have to add .reveal and all that, see here http://jsfiddle.net/nGZku/
[20:20:31] <nachooo> vladikoff: yeah, well, that was my problem, I have multiple modals, I don't need a selector for them, I just need to catch the event
[20:24:08] <nachooo> vladikoff: there is no other way than what you did?
[20:24:16] <vladikoff> nachooo, hmm
[20:25:30] <vladikoff> nachooo, doesn't look like it :\
[20:25:41] <nachooo> vladikoff: should I look for another plugin?
[20:26:16] <vladikoff> nachooo, either that or find some twisted way to make it work :D
[20:26:45] <nachooo> vladikoff: I don't mind modifying the plugin or doing some extension, but I don't have enough coding skills to do that
[20:28:40] <RingtailedFox> tw2113, i can't get the script to change width
[20:28:52] <RingtailedFox> it insists on being 30% wide... i've tried 150, 150px, 15%.... all have done nothing
[20:29:36] <tw2113> it looks the exact same as i saw earlier..why aren't the custom css bits in there?
[20:29:49] <tw2113> i pretty much copy/pasted what you needed
[20:30:22] <RingtailedFox> uploading now
[20:32:40] <RingtailedFox> try now
[20:32:47] <RingtailedFox> nothing has changed
[20:33:57] <tw2113> i don't see anything different still
[20:34:00] <RingtailedFox> yah
[20:34:06] <RingtailedFox> i changed it from 30% to 15%
[20:34:16] <tw2113> i don't see anything related to that css i pasted earlier
[20:34:22] <tw2113> are you editing some css file?
[20:34:25] <RingtailedFox> no
[20:34:52] <RingtailedFox> mobianlegends.com/head.txt
[20:34:54] <RingtailedFox> that's the php file
[20:34:57] <RingtailedFox> created for you to see
[20:35:17] <RingtailedFox> $("#table-of-contents").headerlinks({ 'width': '15%' , 'border': '1px solid black' , 'padding': '10px' , 'font-size': '10px' });
[20:35:19] <tw2113> ot
[20:35:24] <tw2113> it's not showing up in http://mobianlegends.com/alpha/contact.php
[20:35:40] <RingtailedFox> it loaded there for me
[20:35:49] <tw2113> not for me
[20:35:54] <RingtailedFox> o.O
[20:36:26] <RingtailedFox> how abotu http://mobianlegends.com/games/ ?
[20:37:29] <tw2113> shows up there
[20:38:04] <RingtailedFox> how wide?
[20:38:05] <RingtailedFox> very?
[20:38:49] <tw2113> ah i know why
[20:39:01] <RonWhoCares> Wondering if anyone has an example that they could show me.  What I am looking to do is submit a form with new inventory quantity with JQuery ... and then update the quantity, without refreshing the screen
[20:39:04] <RingtailedFox> oh?
[20:39:26] <tw2113> $("#table-of-contents").headerlinks({ css: { 'width': '15%' , 'border': '1px solid black' , 'padding': '10px' , 'font-size': '10px' } });
[20:39:40] <RingtailedFox> should i change it to 150px?
[20:39:53] <RonWhoCares> I am looking for a single input field for users to type
[20:40:01] <tw2113> you're not passing it in correctly RingtailedFox
[20:40:10] <RingtailedFox> what am i doign wrong?
[20:40:13] <tw2113> notice the word "css" and the extra { } around it all
[20:40:30] <RingtailedFox> ok
[20:40:56] <RingtailedFox> remove "css"?
[20:40:59] <tw2113> no
[20:41:31] <RingtailedFox> remove the extra { }'s?
[20:42:01] <tw2113> no, that's why it's NOT working
[20:42:02] <tw2113> you need them
[20:42:04] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/hbfvB/
[20:42:25] <tw2113> inserted line breaks so you can see the difference
[20:50:05] <coder7of9> i am using scrollable the arrw keys allow scolling. this messes up stuff on ipad. how do i disable the arrow keys from triggering scrolling. i already tried onkeydown if key is arrow preventdefault return false. does not work
[20:50:15] <coder7of9> !answerbot
[20:50:55] <tw2113> .on('keydown',function(event){ });
[20:52:14] <nachooo> vladikoff: I will rewrite everything from Foundation to Bootstrap, it's decided
[20:52:30] <vladikoff> nachooo, oh snap!
[20:52:37] <coder7of9> yes i tried that
[20:53:01] <coder7of9> i am using scrollabel it is not paying attention to my handler
[20:53:06] <nachooo> vladikoff: well, I'm not using many features and if the one that I need doesn't do what I need‚Ä¶ it's time for a change
[20:53:21] <tw2113> did you see my keydown example coder7of9 ?
[20:53:26] <coder7of9> yes
[20:53:28] <coder7of9> moment
[20:57:38] <coder7of9> i tried and i can see that it reaches the part where i call preventdefault on the correct keys. however the div still scrolls left. i am using the scrollable plugin. does it have some of its own default hooks?
[21:03:50] <RingtailedFox> sorry, tw2113 power outage for a minute
[21:03:55] <RingtailedFox> the link you posted was http://jsfiddle.net/hbfvB/ ?
[21:04:02] <tw2113> yup
[21:04:05] <RingtailedFox> ok good
[21:05:38] <tw2113> see the differences?
[21:06:12] <RingtailedFox> yes
[21:07:40] <tw2113> putting it in that spot yet?
[21:08:40] <Ringtailed-Fox> sorry computer's sluggish
[21:08:42] <Ringtailed-Fox> not sure why
[21:11:57] <veQue> ok i have a situation http://jsfiddle.net/y39QP/ there's no jquery yet.. i just want to do a few things. like 1: click a button and not have it glow.
[21:12:19] <veQue> i just want the textboxes to stay glowing
[21:21:08] <Ringtailed-Fox> tw2113, it seems to fail now
[21:22:29] <tw2113> missed a closing }
[21:22:54] <tw2113> change }); to }); }
[21:24:16] <Ringtailed-Fox> hmm
[21:25:11] <tw2113> bajh
[21:25:13] <tw2113> bah*
[21:25:14] <Ringtailed-Fox> hm?
[21:25:19] <tw2113> }); });
[21:25:36] <tw2113> let me double check
[21:26:07] <Ringtailed-Fox> it works now, but STILL takes up 30% of the screen
[21:29:04] <p3lim> I have an issue with a timer http://jsfiddle.net/VqmJx/1/
[21:29:15] <p3lim> As long as I'm sliding it should reset the timer, how?
[21:30:02] <tw2113> as bog as my witless i'm going to get this working for you
[21:30:07] <Ringtailed-Fox> thanks
[21:30:15] <tw2113> change "css" to "container"
[21:30:54] <Ringtailed-Fox> but the primary divs of my pages are called "container"
[21:31:03] <tw2113> in this jquery function call
[21:31:06] <tw2113> 1 spot
[21:31:10] <Ringtailed-Fox> ok
[21:31:12] <tw2113> no id="container"
[21:31:15] <Ringtailed-Fox> ahh ok
[21:31:17] <Ringtailed-Fox> as long as it wont' conflict :D
[21:31:18] <tw2113> no class="container"
[21:31:26] <tw2113> just the word "css" to "container"
[21:31:52] <Ringtailed-Fox> SUCCESS!
[21:32:01] * Ringtailed-Fox hugs tw2113!
[21:32:19] <tw2113> homework for you: research how, in jquery/js, you pass in parameters to plugins
[21:33:01] * Ringtailed-Fox nods
[21:33:29] <Ringtailed-Fox> brb
[22:14:46] <p3lim> Need some help debugging why .closest() doesn't work here: http://jsfiddle.net/nTB5k/
[22:15:27] <Cork> p3lim: cause it's not closest
[22:15:35] <Cork> its a sibling to one of the parents
[22:15:59] <p3lim> Any way I could reach it?
[22:16:06] <p3lim> Without using class/id
[22:16:43] <KarateKip3> Hallow! I have tried several ways to load a phpBB-forum (which is located on the same server) inside a DIV. Why does it load without the original CSS? http://jsfiddle.net/tSxVk/
[22:16:46] <Cork> p3lim: http://jsfiddle.net/nTB5k/2/
[22:16:53] <Cork> opps sorry
[22:17:02] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nTB5k/3/
[22:17:51] <Cork> KarateKip3: cause you can't load a full webpage through ajax
[22:18:00] <Cork> only so called fragments
[22:18:20] <Cork> (at most whats normally in body)
[22:18:40] <Cork> you should never have anything outside body in a fragment that you load through ajax
[22:18:57] <Cork> (and excludes the <body> tag too)
[22:26:19] <ak5> hi I am trying to get jplayer to work with jquery 1.8.2, but it only seems to work with the jquery-1.8.2-ajax-deprecated.min.js provided with the jplayer download
[22:27:37] <coldhead> that's probably why they provide that
[22:27:54] <p3lim> Cork: That example of yours didn't work
[22:28:11] <KarateKip3> Cork: i read in the manual that .load() is used for fragments and .get() is used for whole pages. So then I tried .get() but that still has the same effect. I want to put a whole forum inside a wordpress article. Do you know an alternative or any way i place a whole forum on a page with jQuery?
[22:28:16] <Cork> p3lim: /3 too?
[22:28:29] <Cork> p3lim: forgot one change in the first version
[22:28:29] <p3lim> Yes
[22:28:35] <Cork> GAH
[22:28:38] <Cork> ya.
[22:28:47] <Cork> its .closest('.embed') not .closest('embed')
[22:29:04] <p3lim> :) now it works, thanks
[22:29:09] <ak5> coldhead: I understand that, but I need to integrate it into the framework I am using, and there is possibly a better way to do it, than just substitute the min.js files
[22:29:26] <ak5> coldhead: so the question is more: what is "ajax-depreciated"
[22:29:47] <Cork> KarateKip3: nja... .load can load a full page and then pick a fragment from the stream
[22:30:06] <Cork> KarateKip3: and thats something that shouldn't be done at all actually
[22:30:24] <Cork> KarateKip3: but you're adding what you request to the page you're on
[22:30:40] <Cork> KarateKip3: thats why you can't have head or body or html
[22:31:30] <coldhead> ak5: did you see this? http://spectrum.mit.edu/wp-content/scripts/jplayer/extras/readme.txt
[22:31:35] <KarateKip3> Cork: k, thnx
[22:31:36] <coldhead> it doesn't really clarify matters
[22:31:55] <Cork> KarateKip3: cause if you did you would have <html><head>something</head><body>original page<html><head>new page header</head><body></body></html></body></html>
[22:32:03] <Cork> and that's not valid html
[22:33:45] <Cork> KarateKip3: if you want to load a full page you have three options, 1. iframes, 2. window.location (full page reload), 3. split the page up into fragments so you don't need to make a full page load
[22:34:13] <ak5> coldhead: so I need to find a jplayer.js that does NOT include jquery?
[22:34:55] <zuloyd> hi
[22:35:27] <coldhead> i don't know, ak5, i really don't know what they're doing
[22:35:47] <coldhead> all of those options seem to involve not using jQuery for anything else
[22:35:47] <Cork> sigh why do they bundle jquery at all
[22:36:05] <coldhead> Cork: because they need a special version of jQuery, apparently
[22:36:08] <zuloyd> i'd like to write a tool that allows the user to select an angle with a view similar to this: http://www.supercoloring.com/wp-content/thumbnail/2009_01/angle-9-coloring-page.jpg
[22:36:10] <coldhead> what i'd love to know is WHY
[22:36:13] <Cork> ya
[22:36:26] <zuloyd> i.e. the user can click on the line and drag it to change the angle
[22:36:34] <zuloyd> what would be the best way to do this?
[22:36:36] <coldhead> zuloyd: this may be of use http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/
[22:36:54] <ak5> coldhead: yeah this is stupid :/
[22:36:54] <coldhead> it involves changing and angles
[22:37:36] <Cork> Zuchto: you could prob solve most all of it with css3 transform though
[22:37:52] <coldhead> ak5: http://www.jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide/
[22:38:03] <zuloyd> I'm asking myself whether I should use a canvas and draw the whole thing myself
[22:38:15] <zuloyd> I don't have a good feeling for what's possible with jquery alone
[22:38:19] <Cork> zuloyd: ya, thats one way to do it
[22:38:20] <coldhead> a certain reading of that makes me think that you can just ignore all that crap and use the regular jplayer with your regular jquery and get on with your life
[22:38:29] <Cork> zuloyd: you wouldn't be using jquery either way
[22:38:38] <Cork> zuloyd: its either css or canvas
[22:38:43] <Cork> or svg actually
[22:38:44] <coldhead> like they're bundling a "diet" version of jquery without ajax in case you want to cut down on file size
[22:38:55] <coldhead> but if you want jquery then hey, go nuts
[22:39:10] <ak5> coldhead: yeah, but this doesn't work :D
[22:39:16] <coldhead> doesn't work how?
[22:39:18] <Cork> zuloyd: hmm you might want to have a look at raphael
[22:39:22] <coldhead> interesting error messages?
[22:39:31] <Cork> zuloyd: you could do it through svg
[22:39:44] <Cork> ?g raphael.js @ zuloyd
[22:39:44] <ak5> coldhead: also all the code that I download has jquery built-in I can't find the ONLY jplayer version
[22:39:48] <bot-t> zuloyd, RaphaÎlóJavaScript Library - http://raphaeljs.com/
[22:39:58] <zuloyd> thanks
[22:40:02] <coldhead> i hate this plugin, ak5, and i've never even used it :(
[22:40:28] <Cork> zuloyd: only benefit to using canvas or css is better ie support
[22:40:47] <coldhead> ak5: http://www.jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide/
[22:40:49] <zuloyd> also, I have more control
[22:40:51] <coldhead> at the top of that file
[22:41:03] <Cork> Zuchto: uh, i meant benefit over using canvas or css :)
[22:41:03] <zuloyd> using canvas, I could basically draw anything I want
[22:41:04] <coldhead> they JUST include a CDN jquery (i.e. complete) and the jplayer.min
[22:41:08] <coldhead> and they claim that will work
[22:41:11] <zuloyd> aah
[22:41:16] <ak5> coldhead: ok thanks for your tim
[22:41:25] <zuloyd> but recent IE versions do suppor tcanvas
[22:41:27] <Cork> zuloyd: raphael works in more or less all browsers on the market
[22:41:31] <coldhead> ak5: the best of luck to you
[22:41:42] <zuloyd> good to know
[22:41:52] <Cork> zuloyd: ya, but you can't do everything canvas can in those
[22:42:11] <Cork> cause they actually use the same svg like elements that raphael uses
[22:42:18] <coldhead> zuloyd: you could do it with jquery UI draggable and some trigonometry + css transforms
[22:42:42] <coldhead> that would work everywhere
[22:42:51] <Cork> except ie
[22:43:10] <coldhead> oh dang
[22:43:18] <zuloyd> where does IE fail?
[22:43:26] <coldhead> at the css transform stage
[22:43:32] <Cork> everywhere except vml ~> svg
[22:43:33] <coldhead> same reason kaleidos doesn't work in IE
[22:43:39] <zuloyd> :-/
[22:43:53] <Cork> zuloyd: ie < ie10 doens't have svg, doesn't have css transform, doens't have canvas
[22:43:54] <coldhead> flash?
[22:44:23] <Cork> raphael makes svg and vml autonomous though
[22:44:31] <zuloyd> Cork: IE9 has canvas support i think
[22:44:33] <Cork> so it creates svg for normal browsers
[22:44:40] <Cork> and vml for ie < 10
[22:44:55] <Cork> zuloyd: ya, i think you're right
[22:44:56] <zuloyd> microsoft would do the world a favour by destroying the internet explorer
[22:45:03] <Cork> ya
[22:45:11] <zuloyd> we should start a campaign
[22:45:17] <Cork> ie10 that's almost not out the door, is already behind
[22:47:48] <Cork> zuloyd: ya, ie9 supports canvas
[22:48:11] <Cork> but just to make my point before clear; ie5.5 supports vml :)
[22:48:31] <zuloyd> does raphael work with ie 8?
[22:48:34] <Cork> yes
[22:48:44] <Cork> it works with ie5.5>
[22:50:02] <Cork> and yes excanvas.js does the same, as long as you keep with the commands that can be translated to vml
[22:50:03] <zuloyd> okay. thanks for your help!
[22:50:16] <Cork> ?g excanvas.js
[22:50:17] <bot-t> Cork, ExplorerCanvas - http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/
[22:50:31] <zuloyd> wow, didn't know about that
[22:50:35] <Cork> so it really depends on waht you want to do :)
[22:50:46] <Cork> but i would go with raphael or canvas
[22:50:56] <Cork> that has the best cross browser support
[22:51:13] <zuloyd> well, I want to write a "program" that needs a bunch of features
[22:51:18] <zuloyd> I think for some of them I won't get around canvas
[22:51:49] <Cork> just make sure that excanvas can do them before you stare down that path
[22:51:54] <zuloyd> but if excanvas enables me canvas support for IE8 at least, it should be fine, since older IE versions are dying out

[22:53:56] <Cork> XD
[22:54:13] <coldhead> hahaha
[22:55:23] <veQue> is there a way to send values to a pdf file and save with the click of a button?
[22:55:54] <w00tner> is something wrong with this line? $("#preview").css("background", "url('images/' +dataSplit[0]+ '') no-repeat fixed center");
[22:55:59] <zuloyd> veQue: I'd do it with AJAX and use fpdf on the server side
[22:56:12] <veQue> ok thanks zuloyd
[22:56:48] <zuloyd> doing it with javascript only would be a headache I think
[22:57:23] <veQue> whatever is easiest
[22:58:16] <zuloyd> you won't even need to use ajax. Just store the values locally and add them as GET parameters for the download button
[22:58:17] <coldhead> yes w00tner those quotes are all messed up
[22:58:59] <coldhead> $("#preview").css("background", "url(images/" +dataSplit[0]+ ") no-repeat fixed center");
[22:59:04] <coldhead> that's probably living the dream
[23:16:05] <digs> How do you get a blur event to fire even when you hit a submit button? - I have a form that has input fields that need to be updated with an AJAX call.
[23:16:37] <p3lim_> Cork: Could you send me the fiddle link again? Diff computer :/
[23:17:04] <digs> The AJAX is called on blur... which works for 99% of the cases.
[23:17:05] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nTB5k/3/
[23:17:12] <p3lim_> Thanks
[23:17:45] <digs> However, for the case where the user is in the field, changes it last, and then clicks submit, it doesn't work.
[23:17:56] <Cork> digs: you could trigger the blur event on the element manually
[23:17:57] <digs> it doesn't work == the blur event isn't fired.
[23:18:14] <digs> Yes, that is problamatic though because there are N number of these.
[23:18:16] <Cork> or you could just put the focus on a specific element
[23:18:26] <digs> between 2 and 150 of them.
[23:18:36] <digs> what do you mean?
[23:18:51] <digs> When I click submit, I am concerned that all the other events will stop.
[23:18:52] <veQue> .each doesnt make sense
[23:19:05] <Cork> digs: $('#submit').focus()
[23:19:12] <digs> I will try that.
[23:19:18] <Cork> veQue: what part of it doesn't make sense?
[23:19:52] <veQue> watching a tut and he uses a selector followed by .each
[23:20:25] <veQue> and said it will go thru each selector that meets that criteria
[23:20:36] <veQue> but i though it does that without each
[23:20:41] <Cork> eh
[23:20:48] <Cork> sounds like a bad tutorial
[23:21:06] <Cork> what he means is that it goes through each ELEMENT that was matched by the selector
[23:21:27] <Cork> some jquery commands only work on one element
[23:21:41] <digs> would I need to delay after that focus Cork?
[23:21:54] <Cork> ya
[23:21:59] <Cork> if you want to wait for the event
[23:22:00] <digs> How long do you think?
[23:22:08] <digs> I don't care about the response.
[23:22:15] <Cork> setTimeout(function() {}, 0); should be enough
[23:22:18] <digs> I just care that the call gets made.
[23:22:49] <veQue> Cork: would you say that in some instances .each is redundant?
[23:22:58] <Cork> yes
[23:23:10] <veQue> ok, well i partially understand .each
[23:23:13] <Cork> ex. $('div').addClass('some-class')
[23:23:28] <digs> Nice Cork. You rock man, I really appreciate that fix... it works great.
[23:23:32] <digs> Cork++
[23:23:53] <veQue> $('div').each().addClass('some-class')
[23:24:14] <Cork> veQue: compared to ex. $('div').each(function() { $(this).attr('some-attr', 'new-value'); });
[23:24:21] <Cork> ?.attr
[23:24:22] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[23:24:27] <Cork> first element  <--
[23:25:33] <Cork> digs: btw are you using a form?
[23:25:52] <Cork> digs: cause if you bind the ajax call to the submit event on the form i think you don't need that hack
[23:25:57] <ak5> Hi, I am new to jquery, how can I trigger an event if <spacebar> is pressed?
[23:26:30] <Cork> ak5: you mean just space no in a specific input field or something like that?
[23:26:56] <Cork> and by trigger do you mean get an event when the user does it?
[23:27:18] <digs> Well, this actually works much better Cork, because as I mentioned, there are N of these inputs and there is no way to know which one of those N needs to be called.
[23:27:24] <digs> Because certainly they all do not.
[23:27:40] <digs> Regardless, you just saved me a load of time. Cheers and have a good night.
[23:27:47] <Cork> digs: thats not really what i meant
[23:27:49] <coldhead> ak5: http://jsfiddle.net/SJgsS/
[23:28:14] <digs> Meh, I am too tired to care tonight Cork, on another night I would :/
[23:28:15] <Cork> if you have a submit button, and a form around it all, and you do the ajax call in $('form').submit(function() {});
[23:28:22] <ak5> Cork: yes, trigger an event when <key> is pressed
[23:28:23] <Cork> it should just work :)
[23:28:27] <ak5> in my case spacebar
[23:28:38] <Cork> digs: heh ok, ^^
[23:28:46] <digs> (: - night
[23:29:22] <ak5> coldhead: why did you use $(document) and not $(window)
[23:30:23] <tw2113> is e'ryb'dy cray in here?
[23:30:41] <Cork> ak5: $(document).keypress(function(event) { if(event.charCode !== 32) { return; } /* your code */ });
[23:31:40] <coldhead> ak5: they both work, i just felt kind of documenty
[23:31:52] <coldhead> and on that bombshell
[23:34:14] <ak5> Cork: thanks
[23:34:18] <ak5> coldhead thanks
[23:35:25] <p3lim_> Cork: what if I have multiple audio tags in an array like that, should I use last() then?
[23:36:10] <Cork> p3lim_: the prevAll('audio').last() is to try to find the one closest before the parent
[23:36:24] <Cork> p3lim: so it depends a bit on how you structure the page
[23:36:26] <p3lim_> It will not go further down the DOM?
[23:36:33] <Cork> no
[23:36:38] <Cork> thats what prevAll is for
[23:36:39] <p3lim_> Ok, then I'm safe
[23:36:42] <Cork> ?.prevAll
[23:36:42] <bot-t> .prevAll([selector]): Get all preceding siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prevAll/
[23:36:53] <Qiang> Hi,  I am using colorbox plugin and have problem opening image with question mark in url. the call is $.colorbox({html: '<img src="example.com/some.jpg?r=27837">', photo: true});  any idea?
[23:36:57] <p3lim_> the selector can be a class/id too?
[23:37:02] <p3lim_> (docs didn't say)
[23:37:02] <Cork> yes
[23:37:07] <Cork> id is pointless though
[23:37:09] <p3lim_> Good, thanks
[23:37:19] <p3lim_> It's not, as I have multiple with the same tags
[23:37:21] <Cork> if you want to select on an id just do $('#id')
[23:37:24] <p3lim_> class*
[23:37:39] <Cork> ya, class is fine, and meaning full
[23:37:41] <Cork> but id is not
[23:38:16] <Cork> p3lim: btw if the audio tag is always right before the parent you can do prev('audio').css() instead
[23:38:44] <Cork> a little faster, but it won't manage if theres anything in between the two elements
[23:39:21] <p3lim_> http://jsfiddle.net/nTB5k/5/
[23:39:40] <p3lim_> It's 3-4 parents within, so that wouldn't work
[23:39:59] <p3lim_> the fiddle is merely a cut of the whole thing
[23:40:05] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nTB5k/6/
[23:40:09] <Cork> looks like it should work just fine
[23:40:39] <Cork> but like i said, it only works if <audio> is directly followed by <div class="embed">
[23:40:40] <p3lim_> Yeah, I'm not really hiding it, it was just for testing
[23:40:45] <p3lim_> Yeah
[23:41:03] <Cork> but i normally use nextAll/prevAll my self
[23:41:13] <Cork> it makes the code more stable
[23:41:25] <Cork> and the speed difference isn't that big
[23:42:39] <ak5> I am trying to get the value of somthing inside a div: <div id='myID'>I WANT THIS VALUE</div>, I tried the html() and contents() methods, but they both do something else apparantly :(
[23:42:56] <Cork> ?.text @ ak5
[23:42:56] <bot-t> ak5, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[23:43:17] <Cork> ak5: if you just want to get the text that is
[23:43:28] <ak5> ok
[23:43:29] <ak5> thanks a lot
[23:43:36] <Cork> html() will give you the elements serialized to html
[23:43:49] <Cork> ak5: both html and text will give you all the children too though
[23:43:58] <Cork> ak5: that might be what causes the problem for you
[23:44:43] <ak5> Cork: well, I am trying to get a value that is inserted into the div after another event happens (it is the timestamp of a mp3 player), text() is empty :(
[23:45:20] <Cork> ak5: could you put the entire STRUCTURE in jsfiddle?
[23:45:27] <Cork> the text content doesn't matter
[23:45:46] <ak5> Cork: oh, I am sorry
[23:45:51] <ak5> it was a mistake on my end
[23:45:55] <Cork> ah
[23:46:07] <ak5> now I just need to figure out how to get jplayer to spit out a more exact timestamp
[23:46:10] <ak5> thanks a ton :)
[23:46:16] <Cork> ak5: html() and text() should give you the same content most of the time
[23:46:25] <ak5> oh, ok
[23:46:28] <Cork> only difference is ex if you have something like <br> in it
[23:46:42] <ak5> any good guide I can read? I don't know anything about jquery really
[23:46:47] <ak5> need to get to know the methods
[23:47:00] <Cork> html() gives the text "some<br>text" while text() gives "some text"
[23:47:16] <Cork> ak5: there isn't really a need for a guide
[23:47:25] <Cork> just read the documentations on the functions
[23:47:27] <Cork> ?.text
[23:47:28] <bot-t> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[23:47:32] <Cork> ?.html
[23:47:33] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[23:50:34] <p3lim_> Hm how do I access a child of an object? :/
[23:50:39] <p3lim_> I feel like such a noob :D
[23:50:47] <rmill> obj.child
[23:50:49] <Cork> object or element?
[23:50:53] <p3lim_> element
[23:51:03] <p3lim_> So used to other languages
[23:51:11] <Cork> $(elm).find('find the child')
[23:51:36] <Cork> or if its a direct decentest you can use children()
[23:51:52] <p3lim_> http://jsfiddle.net/pXcdc/
[23:51:58] <rmill> ?eval var obj = { 'hai' : 'bye' }; obj.hai;
[23:51:59] <bot-t> rmill: "bye"
[23:52:19] <rmill> I guess that's useless, since it isn't actually what you want :s
[23:52:36] <Cork> p3lim: from what situation do you need to access the a tag?
[23:52:50] <p3lim_> in the audio player, it's the play button
[23:53:05] <Cork> and you want to react to clicks on it?
[23:53:13] <p3lim_> Yeah, I have that sorted already
[23:53:19] <Cork> so?
[23:53:29] <p3lim_> I just need to access it from the audio element
[23:53:46] <p3lim_> so $('audio').find('.button');
[23:53:46] <Cork> p3lim: it would be grate, if you could add the js where you're trying to do it
[23:54:05] <Cork> p3lim: that would match all audio elements, and all .buttons in them
[23:54:13] <Cork> not sure if that's what you want
[23:54:44] <p3lim_> Yeah, that's fine
[23:55:07] <p3lim_> Only one audio element, and only one element with the class 'button'
[23:55:24] <Cork> $('audio .button') should work then
[23:55:41] <ak5> Cork: so I am trying to get the coordinates of something I am dragging into a div (that has droppable attribute), however, the offset values in the variable passed as a second param to dragstop(), relate to the WINDOW and not the div, can I fix this somehow?
[23:55:42] <p3lim_> It will do, as long as it doesn't look around elsewhere in the DOM
[23:56:08] <ak5> Cork: this is jquery-ui
[23:56:29] <Cork> p3lim: it will find every element with a class button thats inside an audio element, anywhere on the page
[23:57:10] <Cork> ak5: set position: relative; on the div
[23:57:29] <Cork> ak5: or just grab the offset from the parent div and subtract that
