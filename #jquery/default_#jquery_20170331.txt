[00:29:02] <d3m0n> Hey guys, I am trying to add an EventListener to the XMLHttpRequest's 'progress' event handler with the help of MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest. I've set up my ajax request and XHR function but not seeing the console output of the progress function. Anyone mind taking a look: http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/XMyOBE
[01:07:14] <Uhkis> d3m0n: seems to work fine in jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/z8mhhsph/
[01:07:43] <Uhkis> d3m0n: oops, was looking at wrong output
[01:10:42] <Uhkis> d3m0n: lengthComputable is false
[03:29:17] <pippolo> Cork , the problem is the "include", if i try directly on page of form it all is ok
[03:31:17] <pippolo> Cork but i not understand how can i resolve this problem, i not understand what is the source of the problem
[03:48:11] <d3m0n> Uhkis: Hey sorry, didn't see your reply. I tried several json data but not getting anything with legnthComputable
[03:48:32] <Uhkis> d3m0n: quick google said it has something to do with Content-length header
[03:49:38] <d3m0n> Uhkis: Thanks, I'll do some searching now that I know the problem.
[04:03:01] <NoobSkywalker> hey there got the following issue with carousel: http://jsfiddle.net/upjzynf6/2/
[04:03:28] <NoobSkywalker> basically i want an overlay on the bottom
[04:03:45] <NoobSkywalker> but the text (caption slide1) should be on top of that overlay
[04:04:01] <NoobSkywalker> how could i achieve this
[04:08:31] <d3m0n> NoobSkywalker: What about styling the caption to look like the overlay?
[04:08:42] <d3m0n> So then you don't need to add the overlay div
[04:10:11] <d3m0n> Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/upjzynf6/3/  ?
[04:15:27] <keka> I have a table done with jqgrid, it looks fine in chrome but in internet explorer the bottom line is like cut in half. do you know what could be the problem?
[04:16:26] <d3m0n> keka: Have a link to the testcase? We need to see the problem in action.
[04:16:42] <Cork> depends on what cut in half means
[04:17:08] <Cork> if it means its a gap in the line, it most likely means something takes more vertical space then it does in chrome and ends up ontop of the line
[04:17:21] <keka> imagine a table
[04:17:29] <Cork> the best option is to just load the page in ie and inspect the rendered page
[04:17:33] <keka> imagine lines take a defined amount of height
[04:17:38] <Cork> keka: you can't ask us to imaging a bug...
[04:17:49] <d3m0n> Imagination: 404 not found.
[04:18:01] <Cork> either you will have to diagnose it your self or provide something we can diagnose
[04:19:31] <keka> here
[04:19:35] <keka> see the last line
[04:19:36] <keka> https://snag.gy/6PGDJF.jpg
[04:19:41] <NoobSkywalker> d3mon thank you im just thinking thats what i somehow had but there was a different issue then in my case, so i miss something for my particular case in that fiddle. have to check when im @ home. but thx :-)
[04:19:50] <keka> it's not full
[04:20:02] <keka> but in chrome it looks fine
[04:20:08] <keka> in firefox a bit off
[04:20:16] <keka> and in explorer like the worst of all
[04:20:43] <Cork> keka: 1) open the page in internet explorer, 2) hit f12, 3) click the inspect icon, 4) click the rendering bug
[04:20:53] <Cork> 5) see what it is that you selected
[04:20:59] <Cork> 6) correct it so it doesn't go there
[04:21:20] <Cork> keka: this is what we would have to do to answer your question, meaning it can't be imagine or a picture
[04:22:35] <keka> Cork: so inspect element I try it in the line that is cut?
[04:23:01] <Cork> keka: inspect the elements around it and try to find what it is that cuts into it yes
[04:23:02] <keka> it's just a tr with a td
[04:23:33] <keka> the thing is that it looks fine in chrome
[04:23:45] <keka> so if I change something it will probably stop looking ok in chrome
[04:23:52] <Cork> that just means the elements are different heights in the different browsers
[04:23:58] <Cork> that isn't exactly uncommon
[04:24:10] <Cork> but again, you would have to provide a testcase for us to help you
[04:24:23] <d3m0n> Hey Cork, maybe you'll know my about my question earlier. I am trying to grab the progress from XHR's event handler 'progress' but some articles state it won't work without Content-Length header being defined and others say modern browsers like Firefox can do it without, and MDN even has the example I am using but my testcase returns lengthCompatible false. My testcase: http://codepen.io/jstn
[04:24:23] <d3m0n> /pen/XMyOBE , MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Monitoring_progress
[04:25:00] <Cork> keep the lines shorter please...
[04:26:44] <keka> I'm there, but there are tons of styles
[04:27:01] <keka> is there a way to copy them all?
[04:27:03] <Cork> d3m0n: i haven't been able to get that event working (haven't had too much need for it luckily)
[04:27:07] <keka> to show them all together?
[04:27:23] <Cork> d3m0n: last i tried it was that there was need for specific handling server side
[04:27:45] <d3m0n> Cork: Yeah, one article I saw said to define content-length via PHP and add it to the content header before hand
[04:28:13] <d3m0n> Which I can do because it's my own code but interesting MDN doesn't state that anywhere it's required.
[04:28:17] <Cork> keka: simplest is to just save the page from chrome for example, and then see if you can get it to look correct in chrome and reproduce it in ie while reduce the amount of js you need to execute to get there
[04:28:32] <Cork> keka: when you've gotten that far you can start remove elements till the problem goes away
[04:29:03] <Cork> then you have a testcase that can fairly easily be checked to find where it goes wrong
[04:29:16] <Cork> keka: an alternative is to provide a live link to the page with the problem
[04:30:13] <keka> I'm trying something
[04:30:21] <keka> I went to the styles column
[04:30:26] <keka> and I'm changing all the values
[04:30:42] <keka> see if one of the changes fixes everything
[04:31:45] <Cork> d3m0n: the best i can find is https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#firing-events-using-the-progressevent-interface
[04:32:49] <keka> aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[04:32:52] <keka> aaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[04:34:15] <SimpleName> <div class=“block”> <button class=“delete”> </div>  when I click $(‘.delete’) how to the parent $(‘block’) element through $(‘.delete’)’s target
[04:34:40] <Cork> SimpleName: $(this).closest('.block')
[04:34:52] <SimpleName> Cork: thanks
[04:36:28] <keka> there's a property called         border-bottom-style
[04:36:48] <keka> if I unclick that property it looks fine
[04:36:59] <keka> if I click it (enable) it looks bad
[04:37:10] <d3m0n> Cork: So, if I understand correctly, yes, it must have a length set. "and if length is not 0"
[04:37:18] <Cork> if you remove border-bottom-style there would be no border bottom
[04:37:38] <Cork> d3m0n: ya, it's how i read it too
[04:38:10] <keka> Cork: yep and that seems to fix it
[04:39:53] <keka> no border-bottom-style
[04:39:53] <keka> https://snag.gy/aTsg32.jpg
[04:41:02] <keka> with border-bottom -> solid      https://snag.gy/LTaBCk.jpg
[04:46:01] <keka> there's another property that fixes it too
[04:46:04] <keka> inside that one
[04:46:09] <keka> called
[04:47:41] <keka> .ui-jqgrid tr.jqgrow td
[04:50:01] <keka> oh another one
[04:50:04] <keka> padding-bottom
[04:50:14] <keka> if I remove that one it's fixed
[04:50:56] <keka> where would be the best place to put or actually remove these changes in the css?
[05:07:38] <SimpleName> https://dpaste.de/KBs8
[05:07:53] <SimpleName> how to fixed this problem, post success can’t access outer variable
[05:08:26] <keka> so basically I need to remove padding-bottom property from one td which is in the multiply of 10 <tr> s
[05:09:26] <keka> so basically I need to remove padding-bottom property from one td which is in the multiply of 10 <tr> s. all this inside a jqgrid.
[05:11:46] <anli_> Can a webpage host a websocket server?
[05:11:56] <localh0st> Hello, I've got question: why is setting jquery ajax's timeout does not make any effect and it always ends after 1 minute?
[05:12:51] <Cork> anli_: that question doesn't really make sense
[05:13:10] <Cork> anli_: a page can't host anything, a server providing a page; sure
[05:13:29] <anli_> I agree the grammatics was not 100%
[05:13:34] <Cork> localh0st: most likely cause the server has a max connection time
[05:13:42] <anli_> But I disagree in that you did not understand the question
[05:14:13] <Cork> if the question is if a server can provide websocket access it is a kinda pointless question cause of course it can
[05:14:28] <anli_> I would not ask if it was obvious to me
[05:14:41] <Cork> how else would anything provide websocket access?
[05:14:41] <anli_> I think that security concern would be in the way
[05:14:56] <anli_> By running software that was a dedicated server
[05:15:00] <anli_> Instead of a web browser
[05:15:03] <Cork> uh
[05:15:10] <Cork> again you question doesn't make sense
[05:15:15] <localh0st> Cork: in response header I can see this infromation: Keep-Alive:timeout=5, max=98
[05:15:42] <Cork> localh0st: thats keep alive, it has nothing to do with max connection time
[05:15:58] <Cork> anli_: what exactly is it your wondering about?
[05:16:03] <anli_> question closed
[05:16:04] <Cork> if you can provide websocket access from js?
[05:16:09] <Cork> or??
[05:16:47] <anli_> If you can create a listening websocket with js, yes
[05:16:53] <Cork> no you can't
[05:16:58] <anli_> That was an easy answer
[05:17:01] <Cork> websocket is between browser and server
[05:17:13] <Cork> well when you actually asked a question i understood sure
[05:17:16] <anli_> It is of course between client and server, but ok
[05:17:37] <anli_> My question was if that could be translated to "between browser and browser"
[05:17:46] <Cork> but you didn't ask that
[05:17:56] <Cork> you asked if you could provide websocket from a page
[05:18:19] <anli_> "Can a webpage host a websocket server?"
[05:18:23] <Cork> ya, exactly
[05:18:43] <Cork> and a webpage is the content of the page; meaning it has no inherent meaning of browser or server
[05:19:01] <localh0st> Cork: I'm making a call to webservice, I'm sure the webservice is keeping the connection till the end of execution (I'm using it with other application, but call are not made by AJAX POST). php.ini timeout is set to 30 seconds but ajax call ends after 1 minute so this php.ini config is not applied to the ajax call, execution time of the script is set to 360, so this is not a problem either. On what other things should I take a look at?
[05:20:07] <Cork> localh0st: if you want to limit how long the connection is allowed to be you control that from the host server (apache, nginx similar)
[05:20:17] <Cork> not in js
[05:20:33] <Cork> in js you might want to increase how long js lets it be before it closes it
[05:21:05] <Cork> but you never can't to limit time on the client side
[05:21:33] <Cork> (cause then you expose yourself to abuse by ppl just modding the timeout to be 5 days)
[06:01:43] <keka> how do I find the 10th, 20th, 30th etc row using this syntax?       $(this).find('tr:nth-child(odd)').addClass("jqgrow oddTableRow");
[06:02:33] <shoky> hey Cork, do you maybe know what's causing the leak here? seems to leak DOM nodes on chrome but not on FF, afaict.   http://jsbin.com/casavitaqu/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:03:59] <Cork> keka: :nth-child(10n)
[06:05:57] <keka>  $(this).find('tr:nth-child(10n)').find('td:nth-child(1)').removeClass("padding-bottom");
[06:06:05] <keka> is that correct syntactically?
[06:06:17] <Cork> no
[06:06:43] <Cork> or rather well you could just do .children().first()
[06:07:27] <keka> $(this).find('tr:nth-child(10n)').children.first().removeClass("padding-bottom");
[06:07:43] <keka> Cork: like that?
[06:08:33] <Cork> ya
[06:08:35] <Cork> no
[06:08:37] <Cork> children()
[06:08:53] <keka> $(this).find('tr:nth-child(10n)').children().first().removeClass("padding-bottom");
[06:09:15] <Cork> why not just controll this from css btw?
[06:09:19] <Cork> why hack it from js?
[06:09:39] <keka> well it's a jqgrid built from a list dynamically
[06:09:44] <Cork> and?
[06:09:49] <Cork> css still affects it
[06:09:56] <Cork> btw https://jsfiddle.net/tno03Lv8/3/
[06:10:03] <keka> in a 2400 lines file
[06:10:11] <Cork> ok?
[06:10:15] <keka> so I'm a bit lost on how to modify the css
[06:10:26] <Cork> you can write your own
[06:10:36] <Cork> you don't need to modify the one for jqgrid
[06:10:41] <keka> my own what?
[06:10:43] <keka> my own css?
[06:10:57] <Cork> if the entire sites css is in one file then you might want to use a management system for css
[06:11:07] <Cork> as ya, one big static css tends to be unusable
[06:11:48] <keka> Cork: there are a few css files actually
[06:13:32] <keka> I'll try that way first, then I'll see if css works to
[06:13:33] <keka> o
[06:22:08] <shoky> Cork: sorry here's a link with preview enabled in case you take a look.. didn't know jsbin limits to 90 min on anonymous bins.  http://jsbin.com/saloji/edit?html,js,output
[06:22:34] <keka> it didn't work :-(
[06:32:00] <keka> is padding-bottom actually a class?
[06:32:11] <shoky> even IE doesn't seem to leak :S
[06:33:20] <keka> when I select the td it shows in "computed"
[06:33:36] <keka> but I'm not sure that's a class or where the "computed" items come from
[06:42:09] <PCatinean> Hey guys, how do you make a jquery selection that matches a certain patttern, perhaps regex
[06:42:16] <PCatinean> like dd,ddd.dd ?
[06:42:33] <PCatinean> can you also make arithmetic selects?
[06:59:49] <smoleniuch> hi
[07:00:05] <keka> Cork: I cannot get it to work
[07:00:10] <keka> any other suggestion?
[07:24:13] <dotslashlinux> hey guys, specifying a duration to scroll to a certain place, makes scrolling really slow when there isn't much distance and really fast when there's alot of it
[07:24:16] <dotslashlinux> how can I solve this
[07:26:49] <xec> make it go slower for shorter distances and faster for longer. next!
[07:26:54] <Cork> dotslashlinux: you could divide the time on the length?
[07:27:25] <Cork> or rather have a delay and subtract the division on the length
[07:27:36] <xec> actually i got it backwards didnt i
[07:27:46] <Cork> ya, same as i did :)
[07:27:50] <dotslashlinux> I see
[07:28:16] <Cork> PCatinean: you can't have regex in css selectors; what exactly are you trying to match?
[07:28:16] <dotslashlinux> thanks
[07:29:58] <PCatinean> Cork, I am doing automated tests and use selectors to pass price checks, they often change depending on the chart of accounts/taxes in the backend so I thought checking just the format instead of the actual values
[07:32:37] <Cork> PCatinean: you prob have to use .filter() then
[07:32:51] <Cork> you can give it a function and the function can do anything normal js can
[07:33:39] <Cork> $('.prices').filter(function() { return /\d+\.\d{2}/.test($(this).val()) }) for example
[07:46:28] <PCatinean> Cork, that's a very lovely idea and sounds exactly like what I need
[07:46:42] <PCatinean> Not to mention I can use that function to call the backend and get dynamic data required to identify the possible prices :D
[07:46:46] <PCatinean> Very nice!
[07:46:57] <Cork> PCatinean: no you can't
[07:47:04] <PCatinean> I cannot? :(
[07:47:11] <PCatinean> I cannot to ajax calls inside
[07:47:11] <Cork> the function is syncronous so you can't make async dependencies
[07:47:27] <PCatinean> oh...limited knowledge on this one
[07:48:13] * Cork distractedly pounder if await will help with those problems
[07:55:51] <m99l> Hey I have a variable which holds html code, is there a way to get a element by its id? I'm trying with getElementById but it is not a valid function it says
[07:56:07] <m99l> I want to populate a table with some data.
[07:56:13] <Cork> m99l: you have to parse it to dom first
[07:56:39] <Cork> dom = $.parseHTML(string); dom.getElementById()
[07:56:41] <m99l> Actaully, it is dom
[07:56:47] <Cork> or $(dom).find()
[07:57:01] <Cork> html != dom
[07:57:26] <m99l> aha, it's like this now https://pastebin.com/wfvW3E9Z
[07:57:32] <xec> pounder = something that pounds, ponder = think about
[07:57:40] <m99l> I tried both find an getElementById but couldnt get it to work, I'll try again
[07:57:51] <xec> *afk again*
[07:57:52] <xec> XD
[07:57:56] <Cork> m99l: no point in parsing the HTML to then directly append it
[07:58:00] <Cork> you can leave it as html there
[07:58:38] <m99l> And then do GetelementById on my_var?
[07:58:58] <m99l> Aha
[08:04:20] <m99l> Cork if you have time to look at it, shouldn't this work then? https://pastebin.com/cW9N2egK
[08:08:38] <Cork> no
[08:08:52] <Cork> $.parseHTML(my_var).getElementById() would
[08:09:00] <Cork> tempDom is a jquery object already
[08:09:18] <Cork> you should be able to do tempDom.find('#purshaseTable')
[08:09:31] <Cork> btw getElementById doesn't want # in the id
[08:09:46] <Cork> .querySelector(
[08:10:04] <Cork> would be similar to jquery .find
[08:11:52] <m99l> Aha okey, great it works now! It's been a bit confusing with which methords works on the different types.. Thanks :)
[08:36:24] <keka_> I cannot get the table of the freaking grid
[08:36:29] <keka_> 				   	gridComplete: function () { 	   			          $(this).find('tr:nth-child(even)').addClass("jqgrow evenTableRow");
[08:36:43] <keka_> they are doing this, but you don't get the table from here
[08:39:15] <Cork> have you checked if the selector at all matches what you expect?
[08:57:38] <keka_> Cork: I can't get it to actually show me the <tr>, <td> and all those things
[08:57:47] <keka_> seems like it's always showing something internal
[09:16:51] <keka_> Cork: this is what the table looks like  https://snag.gy/NY7StE.jpg
[09:22:10] <keka_> so the jqgrid() method works and it brings something back
[09:22:33] <keka_> the problem is how to get the <td> from that object which it brings back
[09:24:48] <keka_> I think I got it
[09:27:06] <Kartagis> why would I get [object HTMLDivElement] as the first element in DOM?
[09:28:03] <Kartagis> I'm using images += "<div class='imgHolder'><img class='img' src='"+libraryItem.thumbnailURL+"' style='margin: 5px' /></div>"; and $("#images").html(images) after the loop
[09:31:16] <keka_> Cork: I think it's something like this
[09:31:16] <keka_> table.firstChild.childNodes[0].cells[9].style.padding-bottom="0";
[09:54:48] <wedr> Hello, say there's a ton of HTML elements, like <button>, <img>, <div>, and so on, where their ID names will have 'btn' in them. Like, 'XXXbtn', or 'YYYbtnZZZ', and so on. Can jQuery be used to query all HTML elements based on the ID attribute name that contains 'btn'?
[09:57:31] <keka_> why is this not working?
[09:57:33] <keka_> table.firstChild.childNodes[0].cells[9].style.padding-bottom="0";

[10:29:03] <Es0teric> i have a question
[10:31:04] <Es0teric> if i have a jquery plugin that does ajax requests on click + show a hidden div how would i approach modifying that same plugin by always showing the div that displays on click and having all other divs with the same class recursively retain their ajax requests on click
[10:36:55] <keka_> it's not working, any suggestion? https://pastebin.com/f6XNM32F
[10:42:42] <tarwater> i've got multiple tables on a page, with basically identical code. but jquery's tablesorter isn't working on like two of them (out of ten)
[10:42:52] <tarwater> any guess as to why?
[10:43:35] <tarwater> the html tags are the same. only the data is different
[10:43:39] <hlve> ._.
[10:43:48] <tarwater> that's what i said
[11:00:13] <FilipNortic_> tarwater: do they have the same id?
[11:02:44] <FilipNortic_> keka_: table will be a jQuery selector not the element
[11:03:18] <keka_> FilipNortic_: how do I change the css of the tds inside the jquery selector?
[11:04:01] <FilipNortic_> $("slector).css("something", newVal)
[11:04:21] <FilipNortic_> or selectorVariable.css(...)
[11:05:32] <keka_> but the jquery selector is for all the table I guess
[11:05:38] <FilipNortic_> use console.log to check what you got in the variables and/or try and run just the selctors in the console and see what you get
[11:06:12] <Uhkis> keka_: what do you want to change there? first rows ninth cell?
[11:06:34] <keka_> well yeah eventually this builds a table
[11:06:41] <keka_> which has many trs and inside many tds
[11:06:53] <keka_> I want in the 10th row the first td to be changed
[11:08:46] <Uhkis> $('yourtable tr').eq(9).find('td:first-child').css({'padding-bottom': 0});
[11:09:29] <keka_> yourtable is like the id of the table
[11:09:29] <keka_> ?
[11:09:49] <Uhkis> yes
[11:09:54] <Uhkis> selector for the table
[11:12:47] <keka_> Uhkis: you mean this?          table.$('yourtable tr').eq(9).find('td:first-child').css({'padding-bottom': 0});
[11:13:12] <Uhkis> no
[11:13:38] <keka_> Uhkis: so after I get the table with this          var table = jQuery("#"+tableId);
[11:13:41] <keka_> what's next
[11:14:14] <Uhkis> table.find('tr').eq(9).find('td:first-child').css({'padding-bottom': 0}); should do it
[11:14:46] <keka_> how can I view the type of table?
[11:15:12] <Uhkis> type?
[11:24:30] <keka_> Uhkis: well it's not working
[11:24:38] <keka_> but it's not breaking anything either
[11:24:43] <keka_> which is an advance
[11:30:44] <Uhkis> keka_: make a jsfiddle
[11:33:56] <keka_> Uhkis: here's what the table looks like in the debugger
[11:33:57] <keka_> https://snag.gy/MxXrVm.jpg
[11:39:43] <keka_> Uhkis: I think this might work          table[0].cells[9].css({'padding-bottom': 0});
[11:41:09] <Uhkis> why do you refuse to make a fiddle?
[11:42:16] <keka_> Uhkis: it's a big project dude
[11:42:32] <keka_> why do you assume every project can be minimized to 10 lines of code?
[11:42:52] <Uhkis> because this case obviously can be
[11:51:24] <wedr> Does jQuery have a run-only-once function after reloading a tab?
[11:51:36] <wedr> A simple yes/no is fine.
[11:52:14] <keka_> Uhkis: table[0].cells[9] returns a       htmltabledatacellelement
[11:52:27] <keka_> are you familiar with that?
[12:15:24] <hlve> So say I have a layer of iframes... is it possible to check if a parent iframe with an ID of 'test1' exists?
[12:15:36] <hlve> .length is returning 0, even though it is in the dom.
[12:15:37] <hlve> ;/
[12:15:47] * hlve slaps robertmaxrees with a trout.
[12:16:17] <robertmaxrees> like, the parent window?
[12:16:28] <robertmaxrees> or the child of an iframe in the document?
[12:16:29] <hlve> one of the parent iframes.
[12:16:39] <hlve> There's like 40 iframes that get loaded because of pdf.js
[12:16:48] <robertmaxrees> "parent iframes"?
[12:16:54] <dreh> rofl
[12:16:56] <dreh> ABORT
[12:17:01] <dreh> RETREAT ROBERT
[12:17:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:17:14] <robertmaxrees> this is super weird.
[12:17:17] <hlve> It's not my code to refactor.
[12:17:28] <hlve> basically pdf.js loads iframes within iframes within iframes.
[12:17:37] <robertmaxrees> ew
[12:17:43] <hlve> >:/
[12:17:46] <robertmaxrees> for that you'll have to grab the parent window.
[12:18:51] <hlve> window.parent.document.getElementById('#parentiframeIDimlookingfor');
[12:18:52] <hlve> ?
[12:19:27] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to do that however many times it takes for you to get to the iframe you care about.
[12:19:36] <robertmaxrees> though now i gotta ask - why?
[12:21:06] <hlve> Ack. Just trying to tie off loose ends with a feature toggle. The DOM structure between the two is SO different though.
[12:21:47] <robertmaxrees> there a reason you're starting in the context of an iframe?
[12:23:29] <hlve> the feature toggle is for piece of pdf.js that's getting split into a micro service. that microservice is embedded via iframe.
[12:24:27] <hlve> it's very early phases. I don't know why they are so against .load... it would really clean up the dom-maze of iframes
[12:28:25] <robertmaxrees> you mean why pdf.js doesn't use it?  or your company?
[12:29:42] <hlve> No. Why we're implementing the service via manually embedded iframes.
[12:29:43] <hlve> lol
[12:29:48] <hlve> .load would be much cleaner.
[12:30:11] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean using jquery's ajax dealio, not the event handler.
[12:40:48] <hlve> yes
[12:42:35] <robertmaxrees> is this just an internal thing or is it meant for 3rd party sites to use?
[12:50:01] <damasceno> Does anyone know how I can read the following json? -> var json='[{"id":"1","name":"PROD"},{"id":"2","name":"TEST"}]';  Thanks
[14:30:44] <Duikb00t-home> Hello, I have a question. I have a method where I do: e.preventDefault();
[14:30:54] <Duikb00t-home> How can i disable: 'e.preventDefault();
[14:33:15] <pavonia> Don't call it :D
[14:33:33] <Duikb00t-home> haha
[14:33:51] <pavonia> Seriously, what do you mean?
[14:33:55] <Duikb00t-home> But let's say I cal it on a list item like : ul li a
[14:33:55] <Duikb00t-home> with 10 items but I don't want it on the latest one :P
[14:33:55] <taplar> that's some Ocam's Razor shit right there
[14:34:05] <Duikb00t-home> Maybe... I just have to limit it in my selector.
[14:52:08] <wedr> Does jQuery have a run-only-once function after reloading a tab?
[14:52:56] <robertmaxrees> reloading a tab in your browser or a UI control?
[14:53:45] <robertmaxrees> wedr
[14:55:30] <wedr> robertmaxrees: reloading a tab in the browser via window.location.reload().
[14:56:10] <taplar> a refresh causes the entire page to be rebuilt
[14:56:16] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:56:19] <wedr> Hm...
[14:56:26] <robertmaxrees> so just stick yer code in there.
[14:56:37] <robertmaxrees> document.ready or otherwise.
[14:56:50] <wedr> Then I guess I need to use the injection method in add-on extensions...
[14:56:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:57:00] <robertmaxrees> are you making a userscript?
[14:57:04] <wedr> yep
[14:57:12] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of pertinent info.
[14:57:14] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:57:25] <robertmaxrees> i might check to see what the script manager thinger suggests.
[14:57:29] <wedr> I see. It's commonplace.
[14:57:42] <wedr> Using content scripts to "inject" your scripts into the background.
[14:57:55] <wedr> That's what the WebExtension and Chrome Extension APIs tell you to do.
[14:57:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying it isn't, just that it greatly changes the way we approach the solution :)
[14:58:00] <wedr> oh
[14:58:10] <taplar> common place is relative to the audience, ^_^
[14:58:16] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:58:26] <wedr> The audiences are developers, hence it's common place.
[14:58:27] <wedr> :D
[14:58:29] <taplar> idk a ft about userscripts, heh
[14:58:34] <taplar> and i'm a developer
[14:58:35] <wedr> ok
[14:58:36] <robertmaxrees> here we generally assume you're just making a webpage.
[14:58:39] <robertmaxrees> we're all developers ;)
[14:58:48] <wedr> Interesting.
[14:58:55] <robertmaxrees> either way!  i'd look into how your script manager suggests you handle it.
[14:59:17] <wedr> Ok, thanks. Main question is answered.
[14:59:26] <robertmaxrees> rad
[17:02:58] <BackEndCoder_> $('.event-list:eq(' + index + ')').hide();
[17:03:04] <BackEndCoder_> if 'index' is a value
[17:03:10] <BackEndCoder_> is that  the correct way of doing it ?
[17:03:38] <BackEndCoder_> (atm  its hiding everything) making me  think index isn't  a value so its  running  eq() like that
[17:37:12] <rjCousineau> Hi, is there a way to shake a body side-to-side with jqueryui? $('body').effect('shake'); doesn;t work
[17:39:46] <robertmaxrees> "shake a body side-to-side"?
[17:40:31] <rjCousineau> correct
[17:40:54] <robertmaxrees> do you have jquery ui?
[17:41:06] <rjCousineau> yes
[17:42:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/6bky1ryh/
[17:42:20] <robertmaxrees> works here.
[17:42:32] <rjCousineau> thank you
[17:42:54] <robertmaxrees> followed https://api.jqueryui.com/shake-effect/
[17:42:56] <rjCousineau> hmm, i must have CSS conflict.. I see something happening to the dom but it's too quick. i'll have to slow it down
[17:42:58] <robertmaxrees> so dunno without seeing it.
[17:43:05] <rjCousineau> yea,
[17:43:09] <rjCousineau> thanks for proving it works
[17:43:27] <robertmaxrees> easy enough test ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:51:02] <rjCousineau> so weird. it only shakes while I move the mouse around.. otherwise chrome dev tools shows the left/right css attributes updating in real time, but the viewport only updates when I move the mouse around.
[17:51:06] <rjCousineau> What a bug
