[00:01:59] <Yahkob> sorry Cork its been a long day that was a terrible noob question heh
[00:02:08] <Cork> np
[00:03:46] <Yahkob> So no need for delegate in this circumstance? When would I need to use delegate()?
[00:04:05] <Yahkob> er i guess on is similar right?
[00:04:34] <Cork> Yahkob: .on is .bind and .delegate merged into one
[00:04:50] <Cork> so if you give a selector as the second argument to .on you get a delegate
[00:04:54] <Cork> if you don't you get a .bind
[00:05:36] <Cavallo> hi
[00:06:00] <Cork> Yahkob: so .on("click",".user",func) is exactly the same thing as .delegate(".user","click",func)
[00:06:22] <Cork> Yahkob: while .on("click",func) is exactly the same thing as .bind("click",func)
[00:06:40] <Yahkob> Ah ok that greatly clears things up Cork
[00:06:51] <Cavallo> does anyone know which plugin is used on this site http://www.megabon.eu/en (boxes with offers, when you go over with mouse) ?
[00:09:22] <morfin> that looks simple to implement
[00:09:44] <morfin> i tink i saw similar plugins somewhere
[00:09:48] <morfin> *think
[00:12:22] <Maffelu> I have three lines of code. Two are working, the last one is not. Could someone help me with why this animation call doesn't work?   http://pastebin.com/cJYZFs5N
[00:12:33] <Maffelu> It is driving me bananas...
[00:13:58] <Cavallo> morfin: yeah, its simple. But why I would do it twice if mybe somewhere is already done :)
[00:14:18] <morfin> shitty datepicker :(
[00:14:49] <morfin> it rely on object id so i think that's why it fails
[00:19:48] <n-a-n> hi all
[00:22:44] <morfin> is a bad idea store references to elements in .data?
[00:23:02] <Cork> morfin: no not really
[00:23:02] <Maffelu> The weird thing is that I can set "top" with just css $('#foo').css('top', '100px'); and that works, but if I do the same with animate, $('#foo').animate({top:'100px'}, 500); it doesn't work. Anyone had that problem?
[00:23:07] <Cork> depends on what you mean by reference
[00:23:11] <morfin> i used that to access something from something else inside of plugin
[00:23:23] <morfin> i was using just $("myelem")
[00:23:35] <Cork> ya, that should be fine
[00:23:59] <Cork> morfin: just be careful if you filter from something else
[00:24:11] <morfin> i know i was using second arg
[00:24:14] <Cork> like $().filter().find().not() or things like that
[00:24:27] <morfin> to specify where look for that element
[00:24:44] <Cork> cause that chain will keep a reference to all elements it ever touched
[00:27:56] <Maffelu> Hm, could it be that I have created the element I am trying to animate with jQuery and that's why I cannot animate it? fadeOut doesn't work either, it just sets the opacity to 1(!) instead of 0 :)
[00:30:25] <Cork> Maffelu: no, it makes no difference if you've created the element with jquery or if it was loaded through html
[00:31:09] <Cork> Maffelu: could you make an example of the problem on jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com?
[00:33:33] <CrowX-> I have this if condition to check if the device is supporting touch events
[00:33:35] <CrowX-> if (!("ontouchstart" in document))
[00:33:53] <CrowX-> and it works, but it also disables touch events anywhere else
[00:34:10] <brunoais> Hi, "As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the DOM tree"
[00:34:25] <brunoais> why this:
[00:34:26] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/bA7MB/
[00:34:26] <GoSox> What's the ideal event to use for binding to the selection of an individual radio button I want to bind to that button, not to the group as a whole?
[00:34:28] <brunoais> does not work?
[00:34:53] <brunoais> GoSox, just bind to that button, then?
[00:35:00] <CrowX-> why does it disable touch events that count as clicks in elements?
[00:35:05] <GoSox> with a click?
[00:35:08] <GoSox> or a change?
[00:35:10] <GoSox> or something else
[00:35:39] <brunoais> GoSox, change event or click event. That depends on the use-case of your page, though
[00:36:36] <brunoais> CrowX-, what disables? jQuery?
[00:36:40] <morfin> hmm
[00:37:16] <morfin> $.data(target,"something") as i know is same as $(target).data("something") right?
[00:37:19] <CrowX-> brunoais, the if cycle I pasted earlier
[00:37:37] <CrowX-> also, I just noticed. it doesn't disables the touch on all elements
[00:37:47] <CrowX-> it only does so for a single button
[00:37:52] <CrowX-> and I'm baffled
[00:37:59] <brunoais> CrowX-, just because the event exists, it does not mean that the browser will ever use it
[00:38:00] <morfin> i am wondering how datepicker lose itself :D
[00:38:25] <computer2000> anyone, why should one use desandro's imagesLoaded rather than jquery's .load() event?
[00:38:28] <morfin> _getInst returns undefined so everything just fuck up
[00:38:36] <CrowX-> brunoais, what do you mean?
[00:38:54] <brunoais> CrowX-, firefox for desktop, for example, supports the touch event
[00:39:07] <brunoais> if I don't have a touch screen, it will never fire the touch event no matter what I do
[00:39:33] <Maffelu> Cork, no I can't :). Feels like i have done something wrong. But I can see in firebug that the row is highlighted when I run the animation effect on it, but nothing is changed. If I do fadeOut() on it, opacity: 1 is added to the element :/
[00:40:19] <Cork> Maffelu: you have a link?
[00:40:30] <Maffelu> local development :(
[00:40:49] <Cork> note much i can do then ^^'
[00:41:07] <Maffelu> hehe, no. Thanks anyways Cork :)
[00:42:37] <brunoais> In the end...
[00:42:43] <brunoais> my question is unanswered..
[00:43:22] <ajqueryy> Hello, I am quite new to jquery. I was hopin g someone could help me out with an ajax issue I'm seeing
[00:43:47] <Maffelu> Can data() on an DOM element have an adverse effect on animate()?
[00:43:50] <ajqueryy> I am using  $.ajax(), but I am not seeing anything happen and i do not know how I can debug this?
[00:46:13] <michelleglauser> I have some jQuery that's supposed to display images from an array, but it's showing the html text instead. What can I do? http://jsfiddle.net/MichelleGlauser/R7MCW/1/
[00:47:59] <Cork> Maffelu: no
[00:48:10] <Cork> Maffelu: .data isn't stored on the dom, so it can't affect it :)
[00:48:19] <brunoais> Maffelu, data() and animate() does not exist in the DOM
[00:48:21] <Maffelu> allrighty
[00:48:39] <ajqueryy>  $.ajax('test.php').done(function(data) { alert('test'); });
[00:48:45] <ajqueryy> is there any reason that wouldn't work?
[00:48:58] <Cork> ajqueryy: no that should work
[00:48:59] <brunoais> ajqueryy, you forgot to make error detection
[00:49:11] <brunoais> read the manual page on how to get a callback when an error occurs
[00:49:23] <Cork> ?fail
[00:49:24] <brunoais> it can be that that page does not exist
[00:49:34] <Cork> ?Deferred.fail
[00:49:44] <Cork> ah, the bot is gone...
[00:49:48] <brunoais> I don't use jQuery much :S
[00:49:57] <brunoais> so I don't know the specifics
[00:50:07] <Cork> ajqueryy. brunoais: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail/
[00:50:07] <brunoais> I still go to the manual or even the source code multiple times
[00:50:22] <ajqueryy> thanks
[00:50:28] <brunoais> the source code tells more than the manual, though
[00:50:37] <brunoais> Cork, are you abel to answer my question?
[00:50:55] <Cork> brunoais: you might have to reask it
[00:50:58] <brunoais> ok
[00:51:00] <brunoais> pls wait
[00:51:10] <brunoais>  "As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the DOM tree"
[00:51:15] <brunoais> why this:
[00:51:18] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/bA7MB/
[00:51:21] <brunoais>  does not work?
[00:51:31] <brunoais> Cork, ^
[00:51:32] <ajqueryy> I added: .fail( function(data) { alert('test'); });
[00:51:36] <ajqueryy> but still I see nothing
[00:51:47] <Cork> brunoais: jquery fake events isn't real events
[00:51:50] <brunoais> ajqueryy, did that code even execute?
[00:51:53] <Cork> brunoais: you can't use native event listeners
[00:52:03] <brunoais> Cork, it says that the event bubbles in the DOM
[00:52:08] <brunoais> then the documentation is wrong
[00:52:16] <brunoais> the event never exists in the DOM
[00:52:19] <Cork> brunoais: it bubbles in the dom, inside jquery
[00:52:26] <brunoais> jQuery != DOM
[00:52:34] <brunoais> jQuery executes outside the DOM
[00:52:37] <Cork> jQuery(DOM)
[00:52:53] <ajqueryy> you were right bruoais
[00:52:53] <brunoais> jQuery executes before the DOM
[00:52:56] <ajqueryy> it wasnt' hitting it
[00:52:59] <Cork> brunoais: some events can't be faked in the dom
[00:53:10] <brunoais> Cork, if they can't they can't
[00:53:14] <brunoais> I don't mind that
[00:53:15] <Cork> so to make things consistent they move these things outside it
[00:53:37] <brunoais> Cork, to make it consistent, just make it go the DOM and inside jQuery
[00:53:41] <brunoais> that way the manual is followed
[00:53:59] <Cork> brunoais: the manual expects you to use jquery
[00:54:13] <brunoais> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/bA7MB/
[00:54:15] <brunoais> ups
[00:54:17] <brunoais> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/bA7MB/3
[00:54:33] <Cork> the last one is 404
[00:54:36] <brunoais> Cork, ... then why does it mention the DOM?
[00:54:45] <brunoais> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/bA7MB/2
[00:54:53] <brunoais> sorry it was wrong revision
[00:54:55] <Cork> brunoais: cause it follows the dom hierarchy
[00:55:23] <Maffelu> So, is there a reason why fadeOut sets opacity to 1?
[00:55:31] <brunoais> the DOM is the document object model maintained by the browser
[00:56:06] <Cork> Maffelu: there is as you see it, but saying what causes it is very hard without seeing it
[00:56:08] <brunoais> Cork, if jQuery is acting as expected, then the situation here is that the documentation is wrong
[00:56:29] <Cork> brunoais: no the documentation isn't exactly wrong
[00:56:31] <brunoais> because in that situation, it's not the DOM tree
[00:56:40] <Maffelu> Cork, just correct me if I am wrong, but doing $('#foo').fadeOut() should generally set the opacity to 0?
[00:56:44] <brunoais> it's the jQuery mirrored DOM tree
[00:56:47] <Cork> it just means the same thing in a slightly different manner
[00:56:58] <brunoais> *jQuery's
[00:57:06] <Cork> brunoais: what the page means is that it follows the dom, not that it fires native events
[00:57:22] <Cork> Maffelu: yes
[00:57:56] <brunoais> Cork, that's not how I read it and I'm positive my interpretation is right.
[00:57:57] <Maffelu> Cork, I just found out it works in Chrome but not in FireFox, that's even worse :)
[00:57:59] <brunoais> I don't mean yours is wrong
[00:58:10] <brunoais> it just seems like it has multiple possible interpretations
[00:58:25] <Cork> brunoais: it isn't my interpretation
[00:58:32] <Cork> it is what the page author means
[00:58:54] <Cork> brunoais: and as it follows the dom he isn't exactly wrong
[00:59:05] <brunoais> Cork, it can be what he means but it is written in such way that it has multiple meanings where one is wrong
[00:59:19] <Cork> you just read in in bubbles in the dom to mean native dom event
[00:59:30] <brunoais> because jQuery != DOM
[00:59:43] <Cork> and as jquery never fires native dom events since many versions ago that is never true
[01:00:01] <Cork> brunoais: and dom != native events
[01:00:02] <brunoais> if it bubbles the DOM, then it means that it goes to the DOM, right?
[01:00:09] <Cork> no
[01:00:30] <brunoais> in my 2nd example, it is a DOM event that bubbles in the DoM
[01:00:31] <Cork> it means it follows the dom hierarchy
[01:00:34] <brunoais> *DOM
[01:00:40] <brunoais> Cork, I got that
[01:00:41] <Cork> brunoais: yes, cause you fire native dom events
[01:00:55] <brunoais> the issue here is that I was fooled by it
[01:01:14] <Cork> brunoais: the issue is that you assumed dom == native
[01:01:34] <Cork> dom is normally referred to as for the tree structure
[01:01:49] <Cork> not the browsers native event loop
[01:02:17] <brunoais> Cork, this is what DOM is for me :S: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model
[01:02:32] <Cork> brunoais: yes
[01:02:43] <Cork> and both the descriptions are true for that
[01:02:44] <brunoais> Cork, the DOM is in a tree strocture
[01:02:52] <brunoais> *structure
[01:02:54] <brunoais> and this
[01:03:11] <Cork> but dom isn't specific enough to force dom events
[01:03:18] <brunoais> Cork, this is DOM: http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/
[01:03:30] <Cork> ex. if you use xml dom or dom in server code you don't have events
[01:03:34] <Cork> (except in node.js)
[01:03:56] <Cork> brunoais: you're not proving anything with those links
[01:04:09] <Cork> the documentations meaning of dom is correct for those links
[01:04:13] <brunoais> Cork, I'm just trying to tell you the meaning of "DOM" to me
[01:04:13] <Cork> brunoais: and so is your
[01:04:19] <brunoais> ok
[01:04:39] <Cork> brunoais: the difference is dom doesn't have to include events
[01:04:43] <Cork> it doesn't exclude it
[01:05:20] <brunoais> in that case, I'd really prefer if you'd fix the documentation or change jQuery's code (unlikely, it seems...)
[01:05:34] <Cork> brunoais: to what?
[01:05:49] <brunoais> jQuery's managed DOM tree, for example
[01:05:53] <Cork> add a comment that jquery doesn't fire native dom event loops?
[01:05:58] <brunoais> or intenal jQuery event system
[01:06:07] <brunoais> instead of mentioning DOM like that
[01:06:24] <brunoais> a comment can also do if it is on the paragraph next to it
[01:06:41] <Cork> brunoais: ya, it might be a good idea, but it is very hard to express it in a way that won't confuse ppl to think jquery isn't using the native events
[01:06:51] <brunoais> Cork, I'd say... instead of: "As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the DOM tree"
[01:06:55] <Cork> so you might cover your case, but cause a problem in the other end
[01:06:56] <brunoais> I'd use:
[01:07:19] <brunoais> "As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the jQuery's own DOM tree"
[01:07:26] <brunoais> or
[01:07:27] <Cork> but that isn't true
[01:07:31] <brunoais> Oh
[01:07:34] <brunoais> Hum...
[01:07:35] <Cork> it isn't jquerys dom tree
[01:07:42] <Cork> it bubbles up the native dom tree
[01:07:42] <brunoais> in that case...
[01:07:50] <Cork> just not in the browsers event loop
[01:08:01] <brunoais> "As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the jQuery's own event wrapper"
[01:08:08] <Maffelu> lol, I put my entire faulty code in a fiddle. It works in the fiddle. That's so weird I'm having a heart attack!
[01:08:15] <Cork> but it doesn't bubble in the wrapper
[01:08:15] <brunoais> oh wait
[01:08:27] <brunoais> "As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the DOM tree in jQuery's own event wrapper"
[01:08:33] <brunoais> Cork, ^ that?
[01:08:43] <Cork> brunoais: file a bug and see what they say
[01:08:48] <brunoais> ok
[01:08:56] <Cork> the last one sounds acceptable to me
[01:12:12] <brunoais> Cork, http://bugs.jquery.com/ <- is it timing out for you?
[01:12:27] <Cork> nope
[01:12:51] <Cork> might be the cdn node you end up on
[01:13:25] <ravenzz> it is
[01:13:46] <ravenzz> either for me and downforeveryoneorjustme.com
[01:13:55] <ravenzz> good morning
[01:14:31] <brunoais> good mornin'
[01:16:17] <brunoais> ravenzz, that website feels broken
[01:16:36] <brunoais> it always shows:
[01:16:39] <brunoais> "Huh? http://q doesn't look like a site on the interwho."
[01:16:43] <brunoais> no matter what I input
[01:16:59] <ravenzz> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http://bugs.jquery.com/
[01:17:11] <brunoais> ravenzz, for example
[01:17:12] <brunoais> http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/q?domain=http%3A%2F%2Fbugs.jquery.com
[01:17:33] <brunoais> hum?
[01:17:37] <brunoais> urls are different...
[01:19:40] <ravenzz> idk
[01:19:55] <brunoais> ravenzz, Bah I found it
[01:20:09] <CrowX-> why doesn't this line work in firefox?
[01:20:09] <CrowX-> width: parseFloat($(element).attr('data-multiplySize')) * ($(window).width() - $('.presspage').width() - parseInt($('.presspage').css('margin-left'), 10) - parseInt($('.presspage').css('margin-right'), 10) - parseInt($('.presspage').css('margin'), 10) - 5) + 'px',
[01:20:15] <CrowX-> it works perfectly fine in chrome
[01:20:18] <brunoais> ravenzz, it was one of my extensions that was detecting suspecting behaviour
[01:20:29] <ravenzz> I see
[01:20:40] <brunoais> so it was blocking javascript
[01:20:52] <brunoais> CrowX-, pls pastebin that. I'll try reading it
[01:20:58] <CrowX-> ok
[01:21:30] <brunoais> CrowX-, call me when done
[01:21:50] <CrowX-> brunoais, http://pastebin.com/PzXmTrtj
[01:22:34] <brunoais> CrowX-, what does "element" point to?
[01:22:48] <brunoais> is it a DOM element or a jQuery DOM element?
[01:22:57] <CrowX-> brunoais, element is a video element
[01:23:08] <CrowX-> it's a jquery DOM element
[01:23:09] <brunoais> ok, so it's a DOM element
[01:23:15] <brunoais> hum...
[01:23:15] <brunoais> ok
[01:23:23] <brunoais> CrowX-, when do you execute that code?
[01:23:31] <brunoais> is it after an event?
[01:23:35] <brunoais> if so, which event?
[01:24:18] <CrowX-> brunoais, it's a part of a function that's supposed to set the size of the video element
[01:24:32] <brunoais> Cork, which bug tracker should I use? According to the instuctions, the one on bugs.jQuery.org is for bugs in jQuery code only. The documentation is outside that scope
[01:24:52] <brunoais> CrowX-, when is that function executed?
[01:25:08] <CrowX-> brunoais, after the video element is created, but also on window resize
[01:25:09] <Cork> brunoais: hmm donno then
[01:25:12] <brunoais> different information is only available at different stages of the DOM
[01:25:26] <brunoais> *different stages of the calcluation of the DOM
[01:25:48] <brunoais> CrowX-, Can you make a demo for me?
[01:25:59] <brunoais> I need much more details than that, it seems
[01:26:10] <brunoais> anyway
[01:26:12] <CrowX-> brunoais, I have the page live if you would like to see?
[01:26:17] <brunoais> sutre
[01:26:18] <brunoais> *sure
[01:26:20] <brunoais> link me
[01:26:44] <brunoais> Cork, I'll see if I can get help in the dev channel
[01:27:05] <CrowX-> brunoais, http://rachelschmeidler.com/#press/rachel_cnn
[01:27:38] <CrowX-> it works fine on chrome
[01:27:49] <brunoais> tham... how much javascript does this have?
[01:28:08] <brunoais> pls wait while I dig in
[01:28:55] <CrowX-> brunoais, the function is in ajaxContent.js and it's called optimizeSizePress
[01:29:59] <morfin> any ideas why can appended with .after() inputs when i bnd datepicker does not show datepicker?
[01:30:02] <brunoais> CrowX-, you are not waiting for the browser to load the 1st frame
[01:30:16] <brunoais> not until it is loaded, there's no way of it knowing the size of the video
[01:30:41] <CrowX-> brunoais, oh thank you!
[01:30:45] <morfin> i tracked problem: and inst is being lost :(
[01:30:48] <CrowX-> brunoais, how do I wait after it loads its first frame?
[01:31:06] <brunoais> CrowX-, pls wait. I need to get the events list
[01:32:01] <midori-rus> hello guys,  is  there a support channel on this server?
[01:32:03] <CrowX-> the video is created in the loadText function in the "if ($(menuevent.target).attr('data-videoLocation'))" if condition
[01:32:17] <brunoais> CrowX-, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Media_events
[01:32:31] <brunoais> you need the "loadeddata" event
[01:32:45] <CrowX-> ok
[01:32:50] <brunoais> only by then you can get the size of the video
[01:32:57] <brunoais> chrome cheats on it
[01:33:04] <brunoais> and try to assume values
[01:33:07] <brunoais> *tries
[01:33:16] <brunoais> usually it gets it right
[01:33:34] <brunoais> but sometimes it fails hard until the first frame come
[01:33:44] <brunoais> CrowX-, ^
[01:33:46] <brunoais> brb
[01:35:23] <delboy1978uk> how do we get the number of seconds until a given time in javascript?
[01:37:09] <mikeche1en> convert from date to unix timestamp, then subtract?
[01:38:03] <delboy1978uk> yeah, we have a thing thats passing the seconds from a php datetime, only to discover that the pages are being cached so all the calculated seconds are wrong!
[01:38:51] <delboy1978uk> so how can i create a javascript date time object? i can pass in the php date in any format without any trouble
[01:39:01] <brunoais> delboy1978uk, you can always just use the javascript Date object
[01:39:10] <Cork> delboy1978uk: (new Date('2014-04-04T00:00:00')) - (new Date('2013-04-04T00:00:00'))
[01:39:15] <delboy1978uk> ok ill look it up cheers
[01:39:22] <delboy1978uk> ah right even better i'll try that!
[01:42:29] <brunoais> CrowX-, did it work?
[01:43:02] <delboy1978uk> give me a minute lol
[01:43:03] <CrowX-> brunoais, still reading on how to implement loadeddata :)
[01:43:18] <delboy1978uk> sorry u aint talkin to me haha
[01:43:28] <brunoais> CrowX-, it's an event just like any other
[01:43:54] <brunoais> CrowX-, you place a listener with a callback and it will run the js code
[01:44:44] <brunoais> CrowX-, I can't help you much with jQuery's usage, though. I'm still not used to it. I'm more used to using the DOM
[01:47:10] <CrowX-> brunoais, what do I bind the loadeddata event on?
[01:47:15] <CrowX-> the video element?
[01:47:29] <brunoais> CrowX-, yes
[01:47:39] <j__> Hey fellas can anyone tell me why my code stoppd working ? http://jsfiddle.net/UAYdv/
[01:48:39] <brunoais> j__, https://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:48:53] <brunoais> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method."
[01:50:23] <CrowX-> brunoais, it doesn't fix my problem
[01:50:26] <CrowX-> it works same on chrome
[01:50:29] <CrowX-> and same on firefox
[01:50:36] <CrowX-> same problem on ff I mean
[01:50:38] <brunoais> CrowX-, looking...
[01:50:46] <CrowX-> it's not online
[01:50:51] <CrowX-> i did it on the local version
[01:50:54] <CrowX-> sec, i'll upload
[01:51:14] <brunoais> the video controls are a PITA
[01:52:21] <CrowX-> what's PITA?
[01:52:54] <j__> So I did the swap as you suggested bruno but it seem it's still a no-go http://jsfiddle.net/UAYdv/1/
[01:52:59] <brunoais> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pita
[01:53:03] <brunoais> CrowX-, ^
[01:53:15] <brunoais> j__, ok... checking
[01:53:50] <CrowX-> brunoais, I hate it as well, but the client wanted it
[01:54:53] <brunoais> j__, you are using the first 2 parameters in reverse
[01:55:08] <brunoais> https://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:55:43] <brunoais> j__, the event is called click and you want it to call the callback when the event happens in a button element
[01:56:52] <brunoais> CrowX-, I know... the client is always right... If he wants it, it's his problem
[01:57:17] <brunoais> CrowX-, what should it be?
[01:57:20] <brunoais> I mean
[01:57:26] <brunoais> the video has the wrong width, right?
[01:57:34] <brunoais> what is the width that it should have?
[01:58:59] <brunoais> CrowX-, you have some nasty stuff there :S
[01:59:07] <brunoais> too much javascript
[02:00:09] <CrowX-> brunoais, you think it could be simplified?
[02:00:26] <brunoais> CrowX-, Heck yeah!
[02:00:48] <Yahkob> iI have an on click event (document).on('click','.someclass')
[02:00:49] <brunoais> move the HTML and CSS responsabilities to the browser and you can reduce the js by, at least, 1/2
[02:01:03] <brunoais> for example
[02:01:20] <Yahkob> in the on click function i try to console.log $('.class',this).text()
[02:01:37] <brunoais> all related to the <video> tag when the page is loaded, don't use js, for that
[02:01:41] <delboy1978uk> var dateto = new Date('2014-05-01T12:00:00'); says 'Invalid Date' :-s anything wrong with this?
[02:01:55] <brunoais> use js just to change the video src when the correct link is pressed
[02:01:57] <Yahkob> but if I just do $('.someclass').text() in the console it logs all the different elements text
[02:02:17] <Yahkob> just shows up as nothing when i use $('.class',this).text()
[02:02:21] <brunoais> CrowX-, when I load the page it is pitch black
[02:02:24] <brunoais> it makes no sense
[02:02:40] <brunoais> give the browser everything he needs for the first paint
[02:02:45] <brunoais> don't use js for that
[02:02:58] <brunoais> js enhances the page by giving it more interactivity
[02:03:02] <Yahkob> Anyone have any ideas?
[02:03:39] <Yahkob> ah
[02:03:40] <Yahkob> nvm
[02:03:41] <Yahkob> got it
[02:03:47] <brunoais> Yahkob, ... ok
[02:03:49] <brunoais> gl
[02:03:55] <Yahkob> haha thanks
[02:04:03] <Yahkob> bad syntax/being an idiot
[02:04:23] <brunoais> ;)
[02:04:36] <brunoais> CrowX-, I wish I had a good example for ya
[02:04:43] <brunoais> but only commercial products
[02:04:53] <brunoais> All I've made is still private
[02:04:59] <brunoais> Oh... maybe...
[02:07:46] <j__> Hey bruno found the problem man. Turned out I closed my tags wrong at the end and forgot to init the context with jquery. Thnx for the help. At least it's not using deprecated values anymore :)
[02:08:03] <brunoais> j__, you are welcome
[02:08:14] <brunoais> j__, Unfortunately I couldn't help more
[02:08:19] <brunoais> I don't use jQuery much
[02:08:37] <j__> But this is the jQuery irc <.<
[02:08:42] <brunoais> I know
[02:08:56] <brunoais> it's because I'm being forced to use it right now with something else I've made
[02:09:12] <brunoais> it's breaking appart because of trigger
[02:09:21] <brunoais> *.trigger()
[02:09:33] <brunoais> it is not sending the event to the DOM
[02:13:49] <roxlu> hi! I've got some html that contains anchors separated by a comma. I need to remove a couple of anchors and commas with JS. I've got an array with anchor elements now and wondering how I can separate them by command and replace the parsed html with the new one?
[02:14:31] <foofoobar> Hi. I'm looking for a image gallery which places all images next and below each other, no mather what size they have. like a wall of images.
[02:14:43] <foofoobar> I dont remember the name of this type of gallery. Maybe someone give me a hint
[02:15:38] <brunoais> roxlu, can the commas be wriapped in a <span>?
[02:15:59] <roxlu> brunoais: I can't change any of the html
[02:16:00] <brunoais> otherwise you have ot work with the textElement
[02:16:16] <brunoais> roxlu, in that case you have to work with the text element and edit it
[02:16:25] <brunoais> I dunno if jQuery has anything to help you with it

[02:54:14] <alxy> ok, quick question: $(window).bind('beforeunload', function() {}) in which browser will this not work? In the current chrome it does
[02:55:24] <erming> Not really feeling that loads of $(..).on(event, fn{}) everywhere in my applications are the right way to manage all the events in my views. Anyone has a tips for structuring lots of events? Any good view libraries around?
[02:55:52] <erming> some tips*
[02:57:45] <Cork> alxy: it won't work in opera
[02:57:55] <brunoais> erming, that depends on the use-case
[02:58:05] <Cork> alxy: and it might stop working in firefox in a new too distant future
[02:58:16] <brunoais> sometimes loads of events it the right way, other time, it's just a waste of execution time
[02:58:23] <erming> I've used Backbone.View in the past.. But I'm currently trying to find something with ONLY the View-parts
[02:58:33] <alxy> Cork: but in current ff it does work?
[02:58:40] <Cork> alxy: yes
[02:58:59] <alxy> ok, good ..... Is there any crossbrowser solution?
[02:59:05] <Cork> alxy: but it is abused quite a bit, so they are thinking about removing it
[02:59:21] <Cork> alxy: don't depend on doing things before the page unloads
[02:59:32] <erming> I'll show you an example of some old code: https://github.com/erming/shout/blob/7b85b65ad9a8fbb5c157adde0568521b97acb351/client/js/chat.js#L137-L241
[03:00:03] <alxy> Cork: I know, I think it's quite annoying if pages use it (I eprsonally hate it)
[03:00:13] <Cork> alxy: one solution we use (not only for this) is starting a websocket connection when the site is loaded
[03:00:14] <erming> Maybe it's not that bad.. It works, but I'm looking for a way to structure it better
[03:00:30] <Cork> alxy: then you know when the page is unloaded server side as the connection is stopped
[03:00:33] <alxy> But I have some editable data which is not entered in a form ut directly changed in dom via js and if you accidently close page all changes are lost
[03:00:39] <alxy> this is even more annoying
[03:01:03] <Cork> alxy: for that kind of thing you can store the form data on input
[03:01:15] <Cork> and restore it on page load (if it exist)
[03:01:32] <brunoais> erming, sorry. the "view" concept is beyond my compreention
[03:02:33] <alxy> Cork: yeah, but the entire system isnt built to do it like this. The data is saved only in browser (client), until the user hits submit. But if he accidently hit e.g. the back button, all data is lost
[03:02:35] <erming> Ok, np, but thanks for the input anyway! Basically I'm just looking for a way to hook loads of events (like 20-30) in a structured manner, instead of just loads of function calls like that
[03:03:19] <Cork> alxy: ya, so store it in indexedDB/sessionStore/webSQL
[03:03:36] <Cork> alxy: so if they happen to close the page you can restore the data that was there
[03:03:38] <erming> Found this: http://facebook.github.io/react/ .. Might be something I'm looking for
[03:13:39] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/ibunwvt2gg3n1xsrkzlmpa - trying to find out how many positions it is moved with sortable. Not sure if this is the best practice. Anyone?
[03:15:10] <brunoais> Cork, here's another treat from the manual:
[03:15:24] <brunoais> "To trigger handlers bound via jQuery without also triggering the native event, use .triggerHandler() instead"
[03:15:27] <brunoais> from the same page
[03:15:30] <brunoais> :S
[03:15:44] <Cork> ah, right forgot that one
[03:16:01] <brunoais> then that's the best part
[03:16:07] <brunoais> I had forgotten about it
[03:16:16] <Cork> brunoais: note that jquery used to trigger native events
[03:16:29] <Cork> but that changed in jquery 1.5 somewhere
[03:16:30] <brunoais> until when?
[03:16:48] <brunoais> then the documentation was right about 1.3!
[03:16:53] <Cork> ya
[03:17:03] * brunoais headbang!
[03:17:16] * brunoais headbang
[03:17:17] <Cork> brunoais: but that is that it was added then
[03:17:24] * brunoais HEADBANG
[03:17:39] <brunoais> Cork, there's nothing saying that it was removed
[03:17:44] <Cork> exactly
[03:18:04] <Cork> i've never cared about it so i haven't made a fuss about it
[03:18:13] <Cork> donno if the change was intentional or not
[03:18:16] <brunoais> Cork, Oh, Oh! I found another thing
[03:18:30] <brunoais> for the click event it calls the native click event in the DOM itself
[03:18:33] <brunoais> how's that?
[03:18:47] <HelperW_> hello
[03:19:00] <Cork> brunoais: guessing it does elm.onclick()
[03:19:00] <HelperW_> can someone help me why the focus function is not working? http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/Bd
[03:19:04] <brunoais> Cork, even better, right :)
[03:19:05] <Cork> but not sure there
[03:19:20] <Cork> brunoais: the problem is there is no api to ask the browser for event listeners
[03:19:21] <brunoais> Cork, no, not that. It actually dispatches a click event
[03:19:29] <brunoais> I tested that using addEventListener
[03:19:35] <Cork> hmm
[03:19:49] <brunoais> Cork, chrome has that API in the console
[03:19:59] <brunoais> HelperW_, checking
[03:20:06] <HelperW_> Thanks!!! :)
[03:20:26] <Cork> brunoais: some events don't bubble natively, might have something to do with it
[03:20:33] <Cork> not sure
[03:20:58] <brunoais> Cork, change bubbles natively
[03:21:44] <Cork> brunoais: you're welcome to dig into why, i've seen the same before
[03:21:47] <Cork> just never cared
[03:22:04] <brunoais> HelperW_, where's the element with the id:DOPBookingSystem_CheckOutView1
[03:22:05] <brunoais> ?
[03:22:24] <brunoais> Cork, Ok, I'll see if I can cheat my boss into it
[03:22:31] <brunoais> it's way better than that f*** burocracy :)
[03:23:49] <HelperW_> <input type="text" value="" id="DOPBookingSystem_FormField1_1" name="DOPBookingSystem_FormField1_1"> brunoais
[03:25:55] <brunoais> HelperW_, can you jsfiddle that?
[03:26:05] <Cork> uhhh...
[03:26:19] <Cork> chrome doens't support box-sizing: padding-box ?!?
[03:26:32] <brunoais> Cork, rly?
[03:26:37] <brunoais> you sure you did that right?
[03:27:08] <Cork> brunoais: box-sizing: padding-box; => "Invalid property value."
[03:27:12] <Cork> in the developer tools
[03:27:16] <brunoais> Cork, Ah, right
[03:27:27] <brunoais> the padding-box is only on firefox... :S
[03:27:42] <brunoais> you can to live with border-box or content-box
[03:27:56] <brunoais> Cork, did you want border-box?
[03:28:07] <Cork> brunoais: no border is the default
[03:28:10] <brunoais> I never needed padding-box, at least,  yet
[03:28:23] <brunoais> Cork, content-box is the default
[03:29:24] <HelperW_> brunoais: how can I fiddle that? It's related to an ajax call on a WP project.
[03:30:00] <Tomashe> Hey guys, anyone have any idea why i got glinchs on my videos here : http://studio4.co.il/
[03:30:06] <brunoais> HelperW_, the .ready() related to DOMContentLoaded
[03:30:10] <brunoais> *related to
[03:30:12] <HelperW_> brunoais: http://imgur.com/a/aVeg6  ( this  is what I do from the bottom to the top )
[03:30:13] <brunoais> *relates
[03:30:37] <brunoais> HelperW_, is that input there when the page loads?
[03:32:10] <Cork> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/nJt5n/
[03:32:16] <HelperW_> No
[03:32:19] <HelperW_> I mean depends
[03:32:33] <HelperW_> When the page is loading you have the start and end timings you can select.
[03:32:37] <brunoais> HelperW_, if the answer is "no" then it's obvious why that code is wrong
[03:32:40] <HelperW_> When the latest date is selected
[03:32:47] <HelperW_> the form loads
[03:33:03] <brunoais> HelperW_, place that event when the input is generated
[03:33:53] <HelperW_> You mean after that input field?
[03:35:18] <brunoais> HelperW_, no
[03:35:25] <brunoais> HelperW_, when that input field
[03:35:33] <brunoais> and don't use its id
[03:35:40] <brunoais> use its node reference directly
[03:36:21] <HelperW_> Ok thanks let's try!
[03:36:27] <brunoais> Cork, which browser is it?
[03:36:29] <brunoais> chrome?
[03:36:34] <Cork> brunoais: chrome and firefox
[03:36:52] <brunoais> Cork, firefox 28 still uses the -moz
[03:37:00] <brunoais> so it is undefined
[03:37:06] <brunoais> chrome (checking...)
[03:37:27] <Cork> brunoais: well i was lazy, and nightly uses boxSizing :)
[03:38:36] <brunoais> Cork, true
[03:38:40] <brunoais> I've been following hte bug
[03:38:42] <Cork> but ya ie, firefox and chrome agrees <select>s default box-sizing is border-box
[03:38:48] <brunoais> I think the alpha already has without the prefix
[03:39:00] <Cork> brunoais: i think it is in beta
[03:39:02] <Cork> but not sure
[03:39:09] <brunoais> it's weird though
[03:39:14] <Cork> meaning it should be release somewhere next week
[03:39:19] <brunoais> Cork, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing#Values
[03:39:44] <Cork> brunoais: ya, i know
[03:39:59] <Cork> the annoying part is that chrome shows padding-box in the dev tools
[03:40:04] <Cork> as a dropdown option >_<
[03:40:13] <brunoais> That's not annoying
[03:40:20] <brunoais> that's dumb and funny
[03:40:26] <Cork> heh
[03:40:26] <brunoais> they know it exists
[03:40:33] <brunoais> but they f*** don't care to implement it
[03:40:36] <brunoais> :D
[03:40:45] <Cork> well it's webkit, what do you expect
[03:40:50] <brunoais> HelperW_, did it work?
[03:41:02] <Cork> it hopefully will be better as blink moves on
[03:41:03] <brunoais> they are very reserved in many things
[03:41:07] <brunoais> yeah
[03:41:29] <brunoais> I dunno if many problems with those kinds of things was related to webkit, though
[03:41:53] <Cork> i've had so many stupid rendering bugs in webkit that...
[03:42:14] <Cork> it especially likes failing to render something and renders nothing
[03:42:27] <Cork> like text going missing in areas and so on
[03:42:35] <brunoais> really?
[03:42:42] <Cork> (my boss has it on one of our login pages)
[03:42:52] <brunoais> maybe it's also why google ran away from webkit
[03:42:54] <Cork> scrolling the page shows it
[03:42:57] <Cork> ya
[03:43:06] <Cork> brunoais: apple isn't interested in fixing bugs
[03:43:14] <brunoais> lol
[03:43:16] <Cork> and google has had enough of that
[03:43:31] <brunoais> now it makes sense why they did that
[03:43:32] <Cork> brunoais: that wasn't a joke
[03:43:45] <brunoais> I know but I laughed anyway
[03:44:11] <Cork> i just loved what apple said when the standard body asked when they would removed there prefixed versions
[03:44:12] <Cork> "never"
[03:44:30] <brunoais> it's ridicilous
[03:44:37] <Cork> not only that
[03:44:56] <Cork> but there documentation for Xcode specifically tells them to use -webkit-<css property>
[03:45:05] <Cork> and nothing about the standard value
[03:45:17] <brunoais> -_-
[03:45:28] <brunoais> -_-'
[03:45:44] <Cork> to the point where ie and firefox actually looked into adding support for -webkit- in there browsers
[03:45:54] <Cork> as so many webpages was webkit prefix only
[03:46:06] <Cork> even for things like opacity and the like
[03:46:32] <Cork> so ya, webkit is the new ie6
[03:46:59] <Cork> now days i'm actually having more bugs in safari then ie11...
[03:47:02] <Cork> it's weird
[03:47:28] <Cork> feels strange to starting ie and having no rendering errors but safari does
[03:48:07] <Tomashe> Cork , would you by any change saw my issue?
[03:48:37] <brunoais> Tomashe, maybe I can help
[03:48:37] <Cork> glitches in video?!?
[03:48:47] <brunoais> Cork, IE11 is quite decent
[03:48:52] <Cork> it is
[03:49:01] <brunoais> it is at the same level of doing things right as firefox
[03:49:18] <Cork> Tomashe: what is the glitches?
[03:49:18] <brunoais> they are working hard on fixing the bs they did with the previous IE's
[03:49:26] <Cork> brunoais: no they arn't
[03:49:36] <brunoais> Cork, really?
[03:49:50] <Cork> they are slightly behind
[03:50:00] <brunoais> but they are doing it right
[03:50:04] <Tomashe> brunois
[03:50:04] <Cork> sure
[03:50:12] <Tomashe> if u look at the video
[03:50:13] <Cork> but they do have bugs
[03:50:21] <brunoais> true
[03:50:21] <Tomashe> u see when the loop restart the video jumps
[03:50:31] <brunoais> but they are working on making it work right
[03:50:35] <brunoais> Tomashe, link pls
[03:50:39] <brunoais> I lost it somewhere above
[03:51:01] <Cork> Tomashe: looks like it's just that the video restarts
[03:51:22] <Tomashe> studio4.co.il
[03:51:31] <Tomashe> yes , its just when video restart
[03:51:46] <Tomashe> but the videos are fine, there is no jump in the video
[03:51:53] <Cork> or do you mean it happens after the restart?
[03:52:16] <Tomashe> the video got loop on the html5
[03:52:29] <Tomashe> u can view the website and u will see what im talking about
[03:52:44] <Tomashe> when the loop happen the video JUMP
[03:52:57] <Cork> Tomashe: except for the leaf blupping away and the text getting removed i see no jump
[03:53:09] <Cork> butter smooth here
[03:53:52] <Tomashe> we tested it in almost 7 computers , in all computers there is a jump in the video when loop start again
[03:54:00] <Cork> Tomashe: might be you're seeing gc jerks
[03:54:07] <Tomashe> gc?
[03:54:10] <brunoais> Tomashe, I see no video
[03:54:14] <Cork> Garbage Collector
[03:54:29] <Tomashe> i dont really understtand that Cork
[03:54:45] <Cork> Tomashe: the browser might need to free memory to do the animation so it needs to frees to run gc
[03:54:49] <Tomashe> brunoais, some images are video .. u should see the movement
[03:55:16] <Cork> anyway i don't see any jumps
[03:55:17] <brunoais> Tomashe, they are not jumping or anything like that
[03:55:18] <Tomashe> Cork: so u mean its preformances issue ?
[03:55:22] <Cork> yes
[03:55:29] <brunoais> but it is using a lot of CPU
[03:55:30] <Tomashe> thats not good
[03:55:35] <Cork> well rather memory pressure
[03:55:52] <Cork> a computer with more ram can go longer before it needs to run gc
[03:56:04] <brunoais> Tomashe, TIPno1
[03:56:07] <Tomashe> Cork: actually i was thinking about that. but was not sure
[03:56:07] <brunoais> don't use flash
[03:56:08] <Cork> and they try to not run gc while a video plays
[03:56:20] <Tomashe> i dont use flash, i use HTML5
[03:56:28] <brunoais> Hum...
[03:56:30] <brunoais> weird...
[03:56:35] * brunoais checking
[03:56:36] <Tomashe> ok ok guys
[03:56:43] <Tomashe> so what is that solution for that
[03:57:00] <Cork> you could try by progressively load the content
[03:57:01] <Tomashe> the videos are those.. i need it to run smoothly for everyone (or almost everyone)
[03:57:11] <brunoais> oh yeah, you are right
[03:57:11] <Cork> so you don't have more then what is on screen
[03:57:13] <brunoais> sorry about that
[03:57:18] <Cork> though most browsers does that already
[03:57:25] <Cork> there isn't too much else you can do
[03:57:30] <brunoais> Hum...
[03:57:32] <brunoais> there is
[03:57:35] <brunoais> 1 video at a time
[03:57:45] <brunoais> use js to control the start and stop
[03:57:49] <Tomashe> but what kills the effect the client wants
[03:57:53] <brunoais> make 1 video run at a time
[03:57:55] <brunoais> Oh
[03:57:57] <brunoais> Hum...
[03:58:03] <Tomashe> they want it as background animated images
[03:58:04] <brunoais> let me analyze more, then
[03:58:15] <brunoais> Tomashe, did you try gif's?
[03:58:24] <Tomashe> those are high rez images
[03:58:28] <Tomashe> gif wont be good for that
[03:58:33] <brunoais> figured :S
[03:58:37] <Cork> Tomashe: you could try reducing the resolution of the videos
[03:58:42] <brunoais> yeah
[03:58:49] <brunoais> make 2 versions, or such
[03:58:55] <Tomashe> thats a problem too, since the website is responsive
[03:59:03] <Tomashe> most people i know use 27screens
[03:59:21] <Tomashe> it will not get clean for them
[03:59:27] <brunoais> it does not feel responsive to me...
[03:59:29] <Tomashe> and the client also use 27 screen
[03:59:32] <Cork> Tomashe: how do you plan to handle 4k displays?
[03:59:40] <Tomashe> change the window size
[03:59:48] <Tomashe> 4k??
[04:00:04] <Tomashe> im talking about 27 screen size
[04:00:07] <Woet> Tomashe: 3840 × 2160 resolutions
[04:00:10] <Cork> Tomashe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_%28resolution%29
[04:00:11] <Tomashe> 27inch
[04:00:12] <brunoais> it is always 3 columnd
[04:00:17] <brunoais> *columns, Tomashe
[04:00:29] <Tomashe> ok4k im not
[04:00:30] <Tomashe> hehe
[04:00:34] <brunoais> Oh wait
[04:00:40] <brunoais> you control the num of columns with js
[04:00:48] <brunoais> I had turned it off
[04:00:53] <Cork> Tomashe: 4096x2160 is comming quite fast on lapptops and monitors
[04:01:11] <Cork> some even go to 7680x4320
[04:01:28] <Tomashe> hmmm
[04:01:34] <Tomashe> so , what do u think the solution
[04:01:45] <Tomashe> png sequence with css animation?
[04:01:47] <Cork> well here we solved it with svg
[04:01:53] <Tomashe> svg?
[04:01:55] <Cork> but it isn't a solution for you
[04:02:00] <Cork> animated svg
[04:02:09] <Cork> it is vector so you can scale it to any size
[04:02:18] <Tomashe> its not solution for me
[04:02:23] <Cork> like i said
[04:02:48] <Cork> so you might need to add a solution that either scales the video
[04:02:48] <Tomashe> the only other option i could think about was png sequence + css animation
[04:02:56] <Cork> or replaces it based on the webpage size
[04:03:29] <Cork> Tomashe: some of those animations isn't really feasible with css animations
[04:03:38] <brunoais> Tomashe, I'd dl all that responsive with CSS
[04:03:44] <Cork> apng is an option, but that isn't cross browser
[04:03:49] <brunoais> these are all boxes with a well defined size, eight?
[04:03:51] <brunoais> *right?
[04:04:05] <Cork> brunoais: the size is relative
[04:04:18] <Cork> the numbers are static, but not there sizes
[04:04:19] <Tomashe> the size calculate with js , depands on some params
[04:04:48] <brunoais> Ah, wait
[04:04:59] <brunoais> Tomashe, it's always 3 columns, right?
[04:05:02] <Tomashe> but i dont think that js thing have anything to do wit hthe lag on the videos
[04:05:09] <Tomashe> yes it is
[04:05:11] <brunoais> it can
[04:05:19] <Tomashe> how so?
[04:05:26] <brunoais> depends.
[04:05:26] <Tomashe> the js calculate and done...
[04:05:35] <brunoais> it can but it doesn't mean that it does
[04:06:15] <Cork> everything using memory will affect it
[04:06:21] <Tomashe> i disabled JS and its still got that issue
[04:06:24] <Cork> as it is memory pressure related
[04:06:44] <Cork> Tomashe: it might even be gpu related
[04:06:58] <brunoais> Tomashe, Cork is right
[04:07:01] <Cork> (as it needs to scale the video canvas)
[04:07:16] <Tomashe> ohh but the scale donw with css and not js
[04:07:31] <Cork> Tomashe: but something still have to do the math
[04:07:34] <Cork> it isn't free ^^'
[04:07:40] <Tomashe> let me disable css
[04:08:48] <Tomashe> even with css/js disabled the is a small lag
[04:10:36] <brunoais> Cork, with js turned off, it is fluid for me
[04:10:47] <brunoais> maybe it's because of my computer's processing power
[04:11:27] <brunoais> Cork, you are right. on a weaker computer it is also failing ot be fluid
[04:11:42] <Cork> brunoais: most likely you have more memory, or rather more free memory
[04:12:36] <Tomashe> hmm
[04:13:09] <brunoais> Cork, 1gig free
[04:13:26] <brunoais> Cork, firefox is taking 2 gigs
[04:17:38] <brunoais> I'm off for a while
[04:17:40] <brunoais> o/
[04:18:40] <decx> whatcha doing that makes lag?
[04:18:46] <decx> *scroll*
[04:18:53] <Tomashe> hmm
[04:19:33] <Tomashe> i will try to chanage ti to png squance with +css but im really afraid that even take more memory. what do u think Cork?
[04:19:38] <Tomashe> or anyone else
[04:19:58] <decx> i see a jump because the videos aren't a perfect loop
[04:19:59] <decx> :>
[04:20:45] <decx> png sequence is a terrible idea, you'll be upping your bw requirements by a magnitude without a video codec
[04:21:20] <Cork> Tomashe: full pngs most likely take more memory
[04:21:38] <Cork> Tomashe: apng i know is more memory friendly
[04:24:40] <Tekla> if the same event triggers a function which includes an ajax call before the last one's return occurred is it gonna disregard the latter event's return?
[04:24:53] <Tomashe> apng is nt good
[04:25:03] <Tomashe> not cross browser supported yet
[04:29:17] <Antaranian> Tekla: sorry ?
[04:29:45] <HelperW_> brunoais: not yet
[04:29:49] <HelperW_> :(
[04:29:51] <Tekla> ok... so there's a table every first column in every row is of class id
[04:30:43] <Tekla> there's a trigger on class .id and it includes an ajax call which for simplicity sake does nothing but returns the variables it received
[04:30:45] <BSaboia> hey, how can I construct an object from a table from all <tds> with a given class? ("selected")
[04:30:54] <seutje> like forreal <td class="id"> ?
[04:31:05] <Tekla> yes
[04:31:12] <seutje> that's awesome
[04:31:20] <Antaranian> :)
[04:32:05] <Tekla> if i trigger this event in rapid succession am i gonna get a bunch of alerts (let's assume the ajax call .done() part displays the return in an alert
[04:32:07] <Tekla> ?
[04:32:58] <Antaranian> yes, you'll get a few alerts, unless you/browser will abort active requests
[04:33:38] <Tekla> thx
[04:34:24] <seutje> BSaboia: vat datas = $('.selected').map(function() { return { id: this.id, text: $(this).text() }; }); or whatever properties u wanna map over
[04:35:11] <BSaboia> seutje, thanks :)
[04:35:30] <BSaboia> can i use arbitrary data-* properties there?
[04:35:50] <seutje> that would give you an array of objects, all containing an ID and text, but u can map over whatever u want. If u wanna do it recursively and get back an object with hierarchy, u'll have to limit the selector to the first level and use a named function that calls itself if there's children that match
[04:35:53] <decx> you give anything back that you can access from this
[04:36:00] <decx> *can
[04:36:15] <seutje> BSaboia: sure
[04:38:48] <maximski> is there a plugin or something that will animate code typing?
[04:40:24] <Antaranian> like insert text char by char, maximski ?
[04:46:20] <joroci> hey, if i set text to a textarea element in memory and then i append the textarea to the dom
[04:46:46] <joroci> the textarea should contain the text?
[04:48:36] <Cork> joroci: not fully sure, but i'm quite sure no
[04:48:58] <Cork> it might also depend on the browser
[04:49:03] <joroci> can i make it happen?
[04:50:49] <Cork> joroci: are you doing something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/GQA5n/
[04:51:40] <joroci> no
[04:51:41] <joroci> like this
[04:51:48] <Cork> (update the fiddle)
[04:52:12] <joroci> http://jsfiddle.net/h92z2/
[04:52:19] <joroci> was already creating one
[04:52:55] <joroci> if i append $elem[0].outerHTML it doesn't work but appending the actual $elem will work
[04:54:00] <Cork> joroci: http://jsfiddle.net/h92z2/1/
[04:54:13] <Cork> i guess that answers your question :)
[04:54:36] <BSaboia> seutje, thaks
[04:55:30] <joroci1> got disconnected
[04:55:34] <joroci1> got disconnected
[04:55:43] <joroci1> if i want to append the html of the element
[04:55:48] <Cork> joroci: http://jsfiddle.net/h92z2/1/
[04:56:21] <brunoais> HelperW_, any more info I can use that can be useful for me?
[04:56:33] <HelperW_> Hmm
[04:56:48] <HelperW_> When I click the latest field
[04:56:58] <decx> that only appends the textarea and not the rest of the form Cork
[04:56:59] <HelperW_> So in the date field 'from' and then 'to' field
[04:57:11] <HelperW_> there pops up an automatic calendar maybe that is preventing the focus?
[04:57:45] <brunoais> dec, try making each DOM element 1 at a time
[04:57:58] <HelperW_> Also it seems  that my form is loaded by AJAX
[04:58:00] <brunoais> It will probablly make more sense that way
[04:58:06] <joroci1> Thanks, Cork
[04:58:09] <HelperW_> DOPBookingSystem_ContactForm1  is already there when it's not yet shown.
[04:58:13] <joroci1> do you know why http://jsfiddle.net/h92z2/2/ isn't working?
[04:58:17] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/h92z2/3/
[04:58:19] <brunoais> HelperW_, huh?
[04:58:20] <Cork> joroci1: didn't really change anything
[04:58:24] <HelperW_> but it's said to display: none;
[04:58:39] <brunoais> HelperW_, the form is with display none, then?
[04:58:44] <brunoais> HelperW_, is the input there?
[04:58:48] <HelperW_> I think:
[04:58:57] <HelperW_> When you select from and then the to date
[04:58:59] <joroci1> i added another line
[04:59:02] <HelperW_> or when both are filled in
[04:59:11] <HelperW_> that then the form becomes display: block;
[04:59:31] <decx> joroci1 you're only appending the textarea and not the rest of your html var, check my fiddle
[05:00:02] <decx> after changing the val() i put end there to make $elem the full changed form
[05:00:17] <joroci1> oh
[05:00:25] <brunoais> jorge_lo, how isn't it workin?
[05:00:30] <brunoais> ups
[05:00:40] <brunoais> joroci1, how isn't it workin?
[05:01:17] <brunoais> HelperW_, Hum... without something I can see, there's not much I can do to help, tbh.
[05:01:20] <joroci1> http://jsfiddle.net/h92z2/2/ the second output is empty
[05:01:26] <brunoais> your situation is not well clear
[05:01:33] <HelperW_> hmm
[05:01:40] <decx> wait i'm stupid, forget everything i wrote joroci1 :>
[05:01:49] <HelperW_> can I give you a join.me url?
[05:01:54] <HelperW_> So I can explain the issue
[05:02:05] <brunoais> joroci1, do you really have to use text to build the HTML?
[05:02:19] <brunoais> HelperW_, I dunno what that is :S
[05:02:24] <brunoais> maybe yes
[05:02:29] <Cork> joroci1: ya, outerHTML grabs the html, not the state of the elements
[05:02:42] <HelperW_> https://join.me/916-048-643 brunoais
[05:02:54] <HelperW_> Can you see something?
[05:03:07] <brunoais> outerHTML gets the HTML textual representation of the element itself andall inside.
[05:03:10] <brunoais> but only the HTML
[05:03:11] <joroci1> it's a template i use
[05:03:15] <brunoais> HelperW_, checking
[05:03:21] <joroci1> this is just an example
[05:03:37] <HelperW_> ok
[05:03:45] <HelperW_> I see you are joined I'll explain what is should do
[05:03:53] <joroci1> i want to create all the html and append it in one time
[05:03:59] <Cork> joroci1: what i meant is that you lose form state when you covert them to html
[05:04:10] <joroci1> yea, i got it :|
[05:04:13] <Cork> *when you convert form elements to html
[05:04:42] <joroci1> so i there a way to solve this?
[05:05:11] <Cork> you would have to grab the value of the field and modify the resulting html as far as i know
[05:05:30] <joroci1> after i append it?
[05:06:13] <Cork> that might be the simplest ya
[05:08:00] <Cork> brunoais: template engines normally use html ya
[05:08:05] <Cork> opps sorry
[05:08:09] <Cork> was in scrollup :z
[05:12:08] <Bruno_> seutje, it is not so easy as I thought. I have a table with id #table1 , and from it, I want to select a specific <td> (which has a class, .prod_id) from a specific selected <tr> (which also has it own class, .highlighted)
[05:12:26] <Bruno_> from select I mean map to an object
[05:13:11] <MikeD_> Bruno_: that doesn't sound difficult
[05:13:45] <seutje> $('#table1').find('tr.highlighted > td.prod_id')
[05:14:17] <Bruno_> MikeD_, yes, bt I am no jquery master
[05:14:27] <Bruno_> seutje, thanks :)
[05:14:28] <seutje> this is more CSS than jqueries though
[05:14:35] <seutje> selector shizzle is the same
[05:15:40] <MikeD_> seutje: why use find() in that instance instead of putting the whole selector into $() ?
[05:16:56] <seutje> not really necessary I suppose
[05:16:57] <MikeD_> i'm no jquery master either, so i'm asking to learn
[05:17:00] <seutje> used to be faster
[05:17:12] <Antaranian> MikeD_: http://jsperf.com/jquery-find-vs-context-sel/38
[05:17:19] <seutje> cause then u'd save time on the regex matching to spin it off to getElementById
[05:17:20] <Bruno_> seutje, well, the css is already working, so for me the clash is on the JQuery.. anyway, it didn;t work. does it matter if I am changing the table contents via ajax?
[05:17:22] <MikeD_> nice
[05:17:36] <seutje> sort of a habit that stuck around :x
[05:18:49] <MikeD_> it makes sense though - getElementById() would be a fast retrieval and "find the children from here" is easier than "find all the children in the document that have this parent"  (assuming no other clever optimization)
[05:18:57] <seutje> Antaranian: that test-case uses regular element selectors though, and half the selectors don't even function the same way :x
[05:19:29] <Antaranian> seutje: it's 6 and 7 there
[05:19:41] <Antaranian> ah, got it
[05:20:07] <seutje> yeah, just saying, it being an ID matters
[05:20:09] <Antaranian> yes maybe that complex query will behave differently, never checked what sizzle does there
[05:20:36] <seutje> but tbh, I think the string it offloaded to QSA as a whole nowadays, isn't it?
[05:21:27] <Antaranian> not sure I follow you
[05:23:35] <Bruno_> seutje, does it matters if the table body is generated via ajax?
[05:28:42] <Antaranian> test
[05:34:03] <Bruno_> seutje, I was able to do like this: http://pastebin.com/j6QSmdZj
[05:35:24] <seutje> Bruno_: u could roll those 2 anonymous functions in a single named one and it'll work for whatever depth ur table is
[05:36:01] <seutje> oh wait, u should probably replace the .find('td') with .find('> td') or .children('td') in case you're nesting tables
[05:36:32] <seutje> Bruno_: if the table is dynamically injected, you'll have to run this afterwards
[05:36:36] <Bruno_> seutje, theonly thing is that I can't get the value I want most (the  "id") with the class, but I can using indexers
[05:37:20] <seutje> Bruno_: sry what? u wanna grab the className instead of the innerText?
[05:37:33] <seutje> or do u want it on top of grabbing the text
[05:40:44] <Bruno_> seutje,  my last <td> is something like <td class="product_id">100</td> , and this class has a display:none style
[05:41:42] <seutje> Bruno_: the display settings don't matter unless you tell jQuery that it does (by adding :hidden or :visible to the selector)
[05:41:57] <seutje> u can grab the class by going $(this).attr('class')
[05:42:10] <Bruno_> seutje, I got it
[05:42:11] <Bruno_> thanks a lot
[05:42:19] <seutje> if u want it on top of the text, u'll have to return an object in the innermost function
[05:42:26] <seutje> instead of just the text
[05:43:21] <MikeD_> do you think putting metadata in the class attribute is still a good idea?
[05:43:48] <MikeD_> sure, if you wanted to style the product_id field, that's a css decision...
[05:44:14] <seutje> isn't it inherently cell number x of the row?
[05:44:27] <seutje> that would moot the css argument
[05:44:38] <MikeD_> but if you are using the class attribute just to identify that field (as a selector) or whatever, isn't that overloading the class attribute?
[05:46:00] <seutje> still faster than selecting on attribute on most browsers, if not all
[05:46:03] <MikeD_> I wrote a ton of code with metadata in "class" because it was the only open(ish) place to put it that passed validation
[05:46:28] <MikeD_> hmm
[05:46:37] <seutje> and we're talking like 10x or something
[05:46:47] <seutje> especially if you wanna match value of the attribute
[05:47:02] <seutje> [foo*='bar'] just kills
[05:49:56] <MoTiOnXml> check out the CSS effect on this site: http://www.ellesse.com/tile/heritage
[05:50:02] <MoTiOnXml> try to scroll down with the mouse wheel
[05:50:06] <seutje> I've looking into switching entirely to data-attributes for selectors for JS behaviors, but it really is a hit
[05:50:46] <MoTiOnXml> i've been looking at the CSS and HTML but i can't see how they apply the initial CSS transform
[05:51:00] <MikeD_> MoTiOnXml: i don't like that experience
[05:52:28] <seutje> MoTiOnXml: u mean the flipover or the header shrinking?
[05:55:42] <MikeD_> you know when you're sitting in a parking spot and the car next to you backs up... it makes you feel like you're rolling forward?  that's the sensation I get from the unexpected scrolling on ellesse.com/tile/heritage
[05:57:12] <MikeD_> fwiw, i'm providing that feedback not as criticism - just sharing for the sake of letting you know some percentage of your audience has that experience.  (most people can't articulate how/why they react the way they do)
[05:58:19] <MoTiOnXml> MikeD_: i didn't implement that site - i just found the effect interesting
[05:58:59] <MikeD_> oh - yeah.  I thought you were looking to have it on your own site
[05:59:07] <MoTiOnXml> seutje: can't see how they're making the :hover experience take the direction of the side entered by the pointer
[05:59:34] <MikeD_> i'll give ya "interesting" but until it catches on and I get over my initial reaction, it'll just be weird :)
[06:00:11] <MoTiOnXml> seutje: looks like they've got some onmouse* events that sets a class and animates properties, just can't figure where they're setting the properties from
[06:00:11] <brunoais> about HelperW_'s problem:
[06:00:24] <HelperW_> brunoais: thanks a lot!
[06:00:30] <brunoais> it was some 3rd party code that was replacing DOM elements in... whatever way it wanted
[06:00:39] <HelperW_> It was horrible :)
[06:00:50] <brunoais> It was a mess :D
[06:01:59] <seutje> MoTiOnXml: http://www.ellesse.com/wp-content/themes/ellesse_desktop/assets/js/tile_page.js?ver=1.0
[06:06:10] <seutje> MoTiOnXml: does it make sense or not?
[06:06:54] <decx> that overlay coming from the direction the mouse entered the element is sweet, totally gonna steal that
[06:08:05] <seutje> haha, just don't repeat $(this) as often as they do ;)
[06:08:52] <decx> yeah i'm just gonna steal the concept, implementing it is the fun part ^^
[06:11:33] <seutje> spend the next few months praying somebody will notice
[06:12:08] <decx> *you didn't notice it, but your brain did*
[06:12:37] <seutje> haha, but have 1 pixel offset and they will spot it instantly
[06:13:01] <seutje> and if it was already offset in the original designs, they didn't bother noticing it then
[06:13:08] <decx> "why doesn't the page look the same on mosaic browser?!"
[06:20:14] <MikeD_> how about:  "Why does the page 'jump around'?"  (because the 'about us' [or w/e] is so short there's no scrollbar and that affects centered layouts)
[06:22:04] <decx> that's why you put html { overflow-y: scroll } in your css
[06:24:45] <morfin> i forgot
[06:24:53] <morfin> old bind can use namespaces?
[06:25:58] <morfin> i mean myelem.bind("click.myplugin",myclick);
[06:26:08] <shoky> yes
[06:28:47] <morfin> shit
[06:29:16] <morfin> i can't find datetimepicker which does not rely on datepicker and does not use new jquery
[06:29:27] <morfin> because if i try 1.9 my code fails
[06:34:17] <decx> time to update your code then innit
[06:39:23] <morfin> impossible
[06:39:35] <morfin> i should fix everything until tomorrow
[06:46:31] <BillCriswell> The number of people requesting help with regular expressions is too damn high!
[06:48:15] <brunoais> BillCriswell, true
[06:48:24] <Justice> when using css background-image with base64 encoding. Can I just use a <img src class="point to css" /> ?
[06:48:32] <brunoais> they are quite easy to work on but ppl always find ways to miss :)
[06:48:52] <brunoais> Justice, I didn't fully understand that
[06:49:46] <BillCriswell> Justice: Yeah, that was quite confusing. Can you rephrase.
[06:50:09] <brunoais> no need to rephase, I just need more details
[06:50:29] <Justice> brunoais: if you use a css file that contains classes of background-image, can I then create a <img> tag in html  that uses that img?
[06:50:39] <decx> you put the base64 string in the source
[06:51:01] <Justice> decx: want to avoid that since it kinda polutes the clean html code
[06:51:14] <decx> don't use an img
[06:51:46] <decx> it can have a background but it's weird
[06:51:58] <brunoais> Justice, what for?
[06:52:07] <brunoais> if you want an image then use the <img>
[06:52:24] <brunoais> if it is a background, then get the right place to place the background
[06:53:34] <Justice> hm lemme get an example
[06:56:43] <Justice> i used a placeholder img before here is the code : http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7314827/
[06:57:03] <Justice> tried to replace with div but it seems im missing something since it wont show up
[06:57:38] <decx> wrong class
[06:57:43] <MikeD_> fwiw - you really shouldn't be putting <p> inside <a>
[06:58:02] <decx> doesnt matter if a is set to block
[06:58:09] <MikeD_> wait, i may be wrong about that thanks to new rules
[06:58:24] <decx> you're right for default behaviour as a is inline an p is block
[06:58:50] <nodedfree> Justice, the <a tag remained open
[06:59:18] <decx> Justice generally for icons it's done with empty spans
[07:00:16] <Justice> decx: hm will try
[07:00:24] <Justice> nodedfree: it closes before the li
[07:01:28] <MikeD_> decx:  i just checked html5 spec, looks like that's no longer true - because <a> is 'transparent' content model with the caveat that it not contain interactive elements, which a <p> is not.
[07:02:56] <MikeD_> http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html#content-models is going to take a while to really "get" intuitively (inline vs block was so much simpler :)
[07:04:03] <decx> yeah i'm reading that atm
[07:05:07] <brunoais> MikeD_, by HTML5 spec, <a> is just a marker, yes
[07:05:17] <brunoais> you can put it anywhere \o/
[07:05:22] <brunoais> , well. almost
[07:07:29] <MikeD_> it is ironic how many "paving the cowpaths" makes early spec violations perfectly acceptable
[07:10:36] <Snoopal> hmm im including jquery and jquery-migrate (its from wordpress) but I can´t access it via $(...) only via jQuery(...) . How can i change this?
[07:11:25] <brunoais> Snoopal, window.$ = window.jQuery
[07:11:26] <brunoais> ?
[07:11:29] <Justice> hm still the img wont show up :/
[07:11:42] <brunoais> Justice, is the path correct?
[07:12:20] <Snoopal> thank you very much brunoais
[07:14:05] <dwarder> what is jquery.js.map ?
[07:14:18] <dwarder> what is jquery.min.map ?
[07:14:54] <Justice> brunoais: yeah thing im applying maybe wrong css code for the span
[07:15:22] <morfin> Snoopal i am using closure for that
[07:15:29] <brunoais> Justice, wrong CSS selector?
[07:16:16] <morfin> (function($){//here you can use $})(jQuery);
[07:18:01] <brunoais> Snoopal, morfin's idea is also a good approach
[07:18:07] <MikeD_>  $('<ul></ul>').appendTo(target).append( ... ).append( ... ) ;   can I break that into: var myul =  $('<ul></ul>').appendTo(target);  myul.append( ... );  [etc] ?
[07:19:11] <brunoais> MikeD_, use $('<ul />') instead
[07:19:21] <brunoais> jQuery knows best what that is
[07:19:42] <brunoais> I'd place the:
[07:19:51] <morfin> btw usually plugins use closure
[07:19:52] <brunoais> $('<ul />') in a variable, instead
[07:20:06] <brunoais> morfin, also most of my code in pages :D
[07:20:07] <MikeD_> ok, but does the $('literal') return a reference to that object?
[07:20:15] <shoky> MikeD_: yes, you can
[07:20:17] <brunoais> I susually only communicate between pieces of code using events
[07:20:21] <morfin> yes)
[07:20:39] <brunoais> MikeD_, yes
[07:21:08] <MikeD_> is there a difference between $('<ul>') and $('<ul />')  ?
[07:21:10] <morfin> $('<li />') returns reference and i remember i was appending it
[07:22:10] <morfin> i mean without putting into DOM
[07:22:35] <decx> your browser probably won't care but $('<tag /> is
[07:22:38] <brunoais> MikeD_, I dunno.
[07:22:42] <decx> nicer
[07:22:45] <brunoais> that is parsed by jQuery
[07:22:52] <brunoais> they are probably equivalent, though
[07:22:53] <MikeD_> is there likely to be any significant performance difference between a series of chained .append() and a bunch of individual statements?
[07:23:09] <brunoais> MikeD_, no, there's no difference
[07:23:27] <brunoais> you'd have to be doing quadrabillions of those in order to be measurable
[07:23:45] <MikeD_> quadrabillions?  hehe.
[07:23:49] <decx> repaint is noticable
[07:24:05] <decx> append to a fragment and group that into one append into the dom
[07:24:48] <MikeD_> does repaint happen within a single execution block?
[07:25:12] <decx> happens for every change
[07:25:47] <MikeD_> so I should create the ul, put all the list items in it, then append the ul to the target?
[07:26:25] <decx> yes
[07:27:15] <Justice> brunoais: im using jquerymobile css classes seems i missed that it got some special for img tags and since this was a span i had do play around with the css code
[07:27:34] <brunoais> Ah
[07:28:00] <brunoais> MikeD_, repaint like that depends
[07:28:05] <brunoais> anyway
[07:28:09] <brunoais> you better make the ul tag
[07:28:14] <brunoais> then place everything inside it
[07:28:20] <brunoais> then place the ul tag in the DOM
[07:28:57] <MikeD_> cool, that's how i'd have done it with vanilla js - but all the jquery examples I've seen are ... different.
[07:29:38] <malorie_> is there a way to make a <a> element not clickable?
[07:29:46] <decx> omit href
[07:29:53] <dwarder> prevent default google it
[07:29:59] <MikeD_> malorie_:  then why are you using an <a> ?
[07:30:27] <malorie_> because I need to wait until the php is ready. then the click on <a> opens a lightbox
[07:30:55] <dwarder> MikeD_: why do you ask such strange questions?
[07:30:58] <NoiseEee> malorie_: what makes you think php isn't "ready" ?
[07:31:00] <decx> php is ready... what?
[07:31:16] <malorie_> NoiseEee: document ready says so
[07:31:18] <dwarder> malorie_: google what i told
[07:31:27] <malorie_> decx: php isn't done rendering html
[07:31:31] <NoiseEee> malorie_: what you're saying doesn't really make sense
[07:31:34] <malorie_> dwarder: ok
[07:31:38] <MikeD_> dwarder:  haha, that's just how I roll?
[07:31:51] <decx> your php is done, but your browser hasnt gotten all the html that your server sent out
[07:32:38] <MikeD_> semantic markup would suggest that an unclickable <a> is better served as a <span> (for example) so I asked
[07:33:49] <MikeD_> last week i was asking if it was ok to use <a> without href because I wanted it to be clickable but have the handler delegated from the parent
[07:33:57] <MikeD_> (for some definition of "ok" )
[07:35:22] <decx> it's <a>-ok
[07:35:31] <MikeD_> haha
[07:42:13] <decx> (Allgäu, Germany) Police investigates assault as a 66year old and a 74year old collide on a walkway when none of the two was making room for the other.
[07:42:50] <axilla> https://gist.github.com/fluffheadsr/11218000  -- good morning all i'm trying to check for the height of figcaption and if its 100% scroll fig caption down to 10%
[07:43:03] <axilla> it goes up, but doesn't come down.. i'm terrible at JS, please assist.
[07:44:45] <brunoais> Now it's time for my question
[07:45:08] <brunoais> How do I make a plugin in jQuery that adds funcitonality to a specific jQuery method
[07:45:09] <brunoais> ?
[07:45:24] <brunoais> I don't want to hide that method from access, I just want to do something else
[07:45:36] <decx> $('figure:hover figcaption') will be empty, as figure isn't hovered on pageload
[07:45:38] <brunoais> ... in addition to what jQuery does
[07:45:49] <decx> and checkforheight never gets executed
[07:46:01] <BillCriswell> brunoais: Sounds dangerous.
[07:46:01] <malorie_> dwarder: I think prevent default doesn't work, in my case. if I call it on document ready, it's already too late, because it takes ~5 secs until the site is  ready, and it's in that time that I'd like to suppress clicks on <a>
[07:46:11] <MikeD_> brunoais: by the time you are qualified to do that you should know how to do that, eh?
[07:46:14] <brunoais> BillCriswell, no, sounds what I need
[07:46:19] <panzi> does anyone know how to compile jquery UI so that I get the jquery.*.js files with filled in templates (like @VERSION)? because I made a fix and now I want to use the fixed version properly compiled
[07:46:28] <brunoais> MikeD_, I wish
[07:46:34] <BillCriswell> brunoais: Sure, but it also sounds dangerous.
[07:46:35] <brunoais> not as easy as it looks
[07:46:44] <brunoais> it is what I need, though
[07:46:53] <brunoais> making like that as a plugin
[07:46:58] <brunoais> something simple
[07:47:20] <MikeD_> make an alias of the method you want, overwrite the method with your supplemental functionality that calls the alias ?
[07:47:21] <BillCriswell> If something else in jQuery is using that method and you change how that works and something else expects it to work a certain way you just destroyed jQuery.
[07:47:23] <brunoais> I'll see if I find something in the extends() docs
[07:47:43] <brunoais> BillCriswell, that's exactly what I'm after
[07:47:49] <brunoais> I want to change trigger()
[07:47:58] <brunoais> I want to add extra stuff inside
[07:48:20] <decx> you can attach stuff to the event that you trigger with trigger
[07:49:51] <brunoais> decx, Huh... I'm not sure
[07:50:02] <brunoais> how do I attach towards all events?
[07:50:23] <brunoais> Or better
[07:50:38] <brunoais> How do I know where events are being triggered in the DOM?
[07:50:40] <MikeD_> you're the kind of person who takes the guard off of powertools, aren't you?  "Safety is for other people"
[07:50:55] <brunoais> MikeD_, not really, no
[07:51:09] <brunoais> I usually don't use powertools, to be more exact
[07:51:23] <BillCriswell> A master of metaphors.
[07:51:27] <brunoais> the DOM is high lever enough
[07:51:32] <brunoais> *level
[07:51:52] <shoky> $.fn.trigger = your wildest dreams;
[07:52:19] <brunoais> shoky, should I be using the extend() method?
[07:52:25] <brunoais> *shouldn't
[07:52:32] <shoky> i don't know what you want to do
[07:53:16] <shoky> and seriously, if you don't know these things then it means you shouldn't be attempting this
[07:53:38] <brunoais> shoky, I know the DOM and I know how it works and how it should be worked with
[07:53:55] <shoky> so what. you're trying to edit jquery, you need to know how jquery works
[07:53:57] <shoky> and javascript
[07:54:10] <brunoais> shoky, I know how js works in quite depth
[07:54:12] <shoky> $.fn.trigger = x;
[07:54:19] <shoky> will change  .trigger() to your own function
[07:54:23] <brunoais> I know what that does
[07:54:36] <brunoais> I just don't know if it can break expectations of other methods
[07:54:39] <MikeD_> I put a spoiler on my car and it was awesome, so now I want to put a spoiler on my hang glider - it'll also be awesome.  :)
[07:54:43] <shoky> of course it can
[07:54:53] <brunoais> I just wonder if it has any gotchas compared to extend()
[07:54:58] <shoky> huh
[07:55:15] <brunoais> so I'd store the current trigger
[07:55:21] <brunoais> change the trigger in jQuery
[07:55:25] <dwarder> what is jquery.min.map ?
[07:55:32] <brunoais> then call the original trigger from my code
[07:55:54] <brunoais> jquery.fn = jQuery.prototype AFAIK
[07:55:59] <BillCriswell> dwarder: It's for source maps. It's only requested when dev tools are open.
[07:56:03] <dcherman2> dwarder: sourcemap file - http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/
[07:56:03] <brunoais> That's done somewhere
[07:56:30] <brunoais> I'll try that
[07:56:38] <brunoais> I just hope there's no gotchas
[07:57:30] <shoky> brunoais there's no difference if you use extend or $.fn.xxx = ...
[07:57:45] <brunoais> shoky, ok, thanks
[07:58:01] <dcherman2> brunoais: are you just trying to modify the behavior for your change event, or all events in general?
[07:58:23] <brunoais> dcherman2, for now, it's a whitelist list of events
[07:58:31] <decx> oh is this still about the change for the checkbox?
[07:58:35] <decx> just trigger click ffs
[07:58:55] <brunoais> decx, in my case it's a <select> that is hidden
[07:59:05] <brunoais> completely outside my code
[07:59:12] <brunoais> hidden in the DOM somewhere
[07:59:32] <decx> but your ticket had the checkbox as well?`!
[07:59:48] <dcherman2> brunoais: if it will continue to be a whitelist, then you could look into using the special events interface ( not documented, but it is a public API )
[07:59:51] <brunoais> decx, it's conceptually equivalent
[08:00:02] <dwarder> dcherman2: thank you
[08:00:06] <dwarder> BillCriswell: thank you
[08:00:13] <brunoais> dcherman2, oooo. Link please *.*
[08:00:34] <brunoais> I saw the special events list in jQuery source code
[08:00:40] <brunoais> there's a special for the change event
[08:00:49] <morfin> hmm
[08:00:56] <dcherman2> brunoais: no docs that i know of, i just end up searching for "special" in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js
[08:00:59] <brunoais> but it is just so that when it happens it uses the internal event management
[08:01:15] <morfin> i am thinking about porting my apps from JQuery to extjs )
[08:01:23] <brunoais> I mean, when the browser does not support the bubbling, it bubbles for it
[08:01:29] <decx> but it works?
[08:01:33] <brunoais> like with the change event in the old IE
[08:01:41] <decx> brunoais http://jsfiddle.net/decx/MLMJq/
[08:02:15] <brunoais> decx, that's not the deal, man
[08:02:24] <decx> well i don't get it ^^
[08:03:21] <brunoais> decx, more like this:http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/MLMJq/1/
[08:03:29] <brunoais> the code on my side used addEventListener
[08:03:42] <brunoais> the code on the other things side, uses the jQuery's way
[08:04:16] <brunoais> the other changes the <select> then it uses jQuery's trigger() to bubble telling everyone that it has changed
[08:04:30] <brunoais> my code is expecting the DOM event only
[08:04:43] <brunoais> because that's what the previous code was doing
[08:05:00] <brunoais> somehow that code slided in with an approval
[08:05:07] <brunoais> and now I'm at this
[08:05:41] <brunoais> and the burocracy to change my lib so that it uses jQuery is so PITA that I prefer to make the jQuery plugin that is way easier to manage
[08:05:50] <brunoais> and requires much less burocracy
[08:06:35] <brunoais> decx, do you understand now :)?
[08:07:04] <Horacsio> hello today .)
[08:07:54] <Horacsio> so, I have this flip almost done: http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/11/ but I can’t reverse it as it says it does here http://guilhemmarty.com/flippy//
[08:12:03] <decx> brunoais use the native version of trigger instead http://jsfiddle.net/decx/MLMJq/2/
[08:12:52] <brunoais> decx, I don't have access to the code that uses jQuery's trigger()
[08:13:38] <decx> you cant change a single line but you want to add a plugin?
[08:13:40] <decx> cmon
[08:15:08] <BillCriswell> I bought a few rolls and some lunch meat to work. They ran out at exactly the same time. This is a serious victory for me.
[08:15:28] <brunoais> decx, the plugin would be on my code. From my code I can add things to the <head> and the <body>
[08:15:38] <decx> what the devil is lunch meat
[08:15:48] <decx> cold cuts?
[08:15:52] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:15:57] <BillCriswell> I guess that's a regional thing.
[08:16:04] <computer2000> whats cold cuts
[08:16:15] <computer2000> like beef jerky?
[08:16:21] <BillCriswell> Dammit. I bought some ham, cheese and rolls.
[08:16:22] <decx> you say: i bought some wurstaufschnitt
[08:16:38] <BillCriswell> decx: I eat real words.
[08:16:51] <MikeD_> lunch meat = meat you eat for lunch, duh.
[08:16:52] <decx> embrace the wurst
[08:16:59] <BillCriswell> s/bought/brought
[08:17:18] <BillCriswell> At least I didn't say to make myself hoagies.
[08:17:28] <BillCriswell> I know that's regional and I avoided it on purpose.
[08:17:54] <decx> as invented by ben franklin
[08:18:14] <BillCriswell> The legend himself.
[08:18:44] <BillCriswell> I bet he was creepy.
[08:19:27] <decx> you only need one look at paintings of him to gather that
[08:20:01] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[08:20:15] <BillCriswell> Good business man though!
[08:20:41] <BillCriswell> Is it fair to say it was easier to come up with a good idea in those times since they were still like... shitting in the street?
[08:24:53] <BillCriswell> That bot is persistent.
[08:25:33] <lericson> BillCriswell: i would argue the contrary
[08:26:23] <BillCriswell> The good ideas or about the bot?
[08:29:09] <morfin> shit i failed
[08:29:32] <morfin> when i use jquery 1.9.1 everything stops working :(
[08:30:03] <NoiseEee> morfin: so stick with an older version?
[08:30:13] <NoiseEee> morfin: or update your code / fix errors
[08:31:13] <Horacsio> I have this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/11/ but i cant reverse it. can someone help?

[08:40:00] <MikeD_> how do i specify first decendant div of a target container?  $(target).find('div') <-- not selective enough
[08:40:12] <Frazzz> decx, that is all thats needed, you can see i append a stylesheet then log the height of an input.
[08:40:32] <erming> MikeD_ "div:first"
[08:40:44] <erming> or $(target).find("div").eq(0) works too
[08:40:55] <erming> or even .first()
[08:41:57] <erming> but maybe you're talking about the selector ">".. Like "target > div".. Well, lunch is ready, bbl
[08:41:58] <MikeD_> i don't want to select first child of a child (grantchildren)
[08:42:29] <MikeD_> target > div:nth-child(1)
[08:44:03] <MikeD_> perhaps smarter is to just set a reference to that element when I add it to the dom?  (duh)
[08:44:22] <Frazzz> decx, http://pastebin.com/73Upey2b
[08:45:36] <decx> they get executed at virtually the same time, so while your css is still downloaded it's already checking the height
[08:48:15] <LeonardDa> Hi guys. I have a custom-function, in which there are two "$.getJSON()"-instructions. Now if I call this custom-function within a "$.when(myCustomFunction()).done.." then the part in "done" isn't executed. Why?
[08:48:22] <Frazzz> thats what i was thinking too
[08:48:27] <Frazzz> any idea how to get around it?
[08:50:35] <LeonardDa> Anybody in here who can help?
[08:50:42] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ LeonardDa
[08:50:42] <b-ot> LeonardDa: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:51:00] <LeonardDa> duch_katzel: Ok my friend :)
[08:51:25] <d0de> http://jsfiddle.net/HW4qq/ this seems to only bind to the last item in myObject, and not every item as I expect it to. What am I doing wrong?
[08:51:39] <d0de> http://jsfiddle.net/HW4qq/1/ rather
[08:51:47] <duch_kazatel> d0de don't do that :(
[08:51:49] <decx> you could get the style, append its contents and do your height check in a callback Frazzz but that seems overly complicated
[08:52:10] <duch_kazatel> d0de use event delegation instead.
[08:53:28] <d0de> duch_kazatel, could you explain why it's wrong please?
[08:53:28] <gnarf> d0de: it does bind to every item, but by the time your callback executes "name" is the last one found in the loop
[08:53:48] <gnarf> d0de: try adding ` name = 'see-i-told-you-so'; right after the for loop
[08:53:57] <gnarf> and all your event handlers will get that for "name"
[08:54:06] <gnarf> what is "myObject" ?
[08:54:41] <duch_kazatel> d0de because you're conditionally binding hanlders.  I always prefer to bind a single handler and deal with the event within the handler itself.  makes things a little easier.
[08:54:52] <d0de> it stores a bunch of sliders, like $('#slider-1'), $('#slider-2') etc
[08:55:12] <gnarf> d0de do they all share a class?
[08:55:20] <d0de> gnarf, they can, trivially
[08:55:25] <duch_kazatel> (they should share one)
[08:55:40] <gnarf> why not $(".sliders").on("change", function(event, ui) { console.log(event, ui, this.name); });
[08:55:42] <gnarf> or even
[08:56:12] <gnarf> $("#theform").on("change", ".slider", function(event, ui) { ... });
[08:56:17] <gnarf> ^ delegated
[08:56:22] <duch_kazatel> :)
[08:57:07] <d0de> but how would I pass the name of the slider to the relevent function with event delegation? I guess I can just grab the id name, and take it out of that?
[08:57:26] <gnarf> d0de - read it from the dom element thats being triggered yeah
[08:58:25] <d0de> duch_kazatel, gnarf, thanks, will try :)
[08:59:40] <LeonardDa> here is the link: http://jsfiddle.net/QPsnb/1/
[09:00:08] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa woah... use jsfiddle's features for this stuff.
[09:00:20] <d0de> but say the id of the slider is "#my-slider-red" or "#my-slider-green" and I need to extract just "red" or "green" to pass to the relevant function, what's the easiest way to do that? a regex?
[09:00:26] <Horacsio> please, why http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/13/ the reverse isn’t working?
[09:00:36] <duch_kazatel> d0de yes, or a data attribute.
[09:01:21] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio because you don't have the reverse set up.  you have one direction set up.
[09:01:36] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa http://i.imgur.com/cZorQDW.png
[09:01:41] <duch_kazatel> learn to use this panel.
[09:02:03] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa and put your javascript in the script panel.
[09:03:26] <Horacsio> how come?! https://github.com/lepixel/flippy#example in the example it says how to deploy the reverse very ezy
[09:03:47] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio because #oferta-back doesn't exist when you run your binding.
[09:04:04] <LeonardDa> ok I updated
[09:04:15] <d0de> duch_kazatel, data attributes look very useful. I didn't know about them, thanks
[09:04:32] <LeonardDa> ok wait
[09:04:56] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/15/
[09:05:02] <Horacsio> still doesn’t work!
[09:05:08] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio take a look at how the code is rendered.
[09:05:14] <TheEternalAbyss> hi there... I think this would be where to ask this.. what am I doing wrong here? I'm trying to pass localStorage value to my php script. it keeps getting the error Undefined index:JPASS in /mydirectory/etcetc/  http://jsfiddle.net/A3xTd
[09:05:31] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio http://i.imgur.com/g99zVcj.png
[09:05:41] <duch_kazatel> think about why that wouldn't work with your code.
[09:05:42] <Horacsio> duch_kazatel: how do I see how the code renders? sorry about my lack of knowledge
[09:05:53] <duch_kazatel> use the HTML panel in firebug or chrome's inspector tool.
[09:06:10] <Horacsio> ok
[09:06:32] <decx> how does it know when it's flipped
[09:06:49] <decx> you need something like http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Y5YaK/16/
[09:06:57] <decx> just not as terrible as a text check
[09:07:08] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:07:28] <LeonardDa> I updated: http://jsfiddle.net/QPsnb/7/
[09:07:31] <Horacsio> decx: but did you saw the exemple at the github? it says only to add $("#oferta-front").flippyReverse();
[09:07:41] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio look at the rendered code
[09:07:57] <decx> the example just does both
[09:08:05] <decx> your click handler is different
[09:08:09] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio the containing div never changes, so your click event registers on the same thing over and over, never on the reverse option.
[09:09:01] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa uh, are you able to pair down your problem a little?  you're still referencing scripts that don't exist (and those should be valid URLs in the external resources anyway)
[09:09:24] <shoky> TheEternalAbyss: maybe try removing the & or just do  var val = {JSPASS: jsVar};
[09:09:41] <Horacsio> yes it’s allways oferta-front that triggers…
[09:09:48] <TheEternalAbyss> shoky: ok i can give it a shot
[09:09:54] <Horacsio> right?
[09:09:57] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio right.
[09:10:05] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio that's why looking at the rendered output is helpful.
[09:10:36] <Horacsio> but once again I have it just like the example, and the example doesnt have no condition
[09:11:01] <duch_kazatel> no, you don't.
[09:11:15] <LeonardDa> I updated
[09:11:20] <duch_kazatel> that reverse method call is what you do to reverse the last action.
[09:11:30] <LeonardDa> Please help me. I only want to know what I am doing wrong
[09:11:41] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa what was the issue again?
[09:12:16] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: The issue is, that the code in "done" is not executed
[09:12:19] <Horacsio> I think I need to have another div to make it as a button to flip the other divs, right?
[09:12:32] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio no, you need to properly bind your listeners :)
[09:12:39] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: In the function "drawDiagram()"
[09:13:08] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa right, i don't think you can use deferreds that way.
[09:13:31] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: Can you show me how I can do this better?
[09:13:45] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa sure - read the docs :)
[09:13:54] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/ is pretty critical.
[09:14:26] <duch_kazatel> among other things, you never call drawDiagram.
[09:16:03] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: lol. I only showed you a small part of my code and you only tell me a link. And know you want to see the whole code? That doesn't make sense :)
[09:16:05] <BillCriswell> Ever a project you hate so much that you think you'd rather be fired than finish it?
[09:16:15] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa huh?
[09:16:20] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa i never asked to see all your code.
[09:16:23] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: Aha.. :)
[09:16:31] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa i think you're confused about how deferreds work.
[09:16:42] <decx> anytime i had to implement customer ideas BillCriswell
[09:16:43] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i used to live in that world.  it was awful.
[09:16:44] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: yeah. maybe
[09:17:23] <BillCriswell> This project is so boring and the time it takes to compile the sass makes it 1,000,000 times worse.
[09:17:31] <decx> i actually got fired on multiple occasions because of that ^^
[09:17:32] <duch_kazatel> :(
[09:17:40] <BillCriswell> Haha nice!
[09:18:03] <decx> you should use that live sass editor/preview plugin for sublime
[09:18:27] <BillCriswell> decx: This is using compass and a shit load of other libraries that require ruby sass.
[09:18:39] <decx> https://github.com/mechio/takana
[09:19:09] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, that uses libsass
[09:19:18] <decx> bummer
[09:19:53] <BillCriswell> I htink in some future projects I'll be able to use libsass.
[09:20:29] <duch_kazatel> holy shit netflix's emails are well executed.
[09:20:40] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I was admiring those the other day.
[09:21:26] <decx> what about them
[09:21:45] <duch_kazatel> my CC got reissued and i forgot to update the payment method with them.  these were the emails I got (in reverse order) - http://i.imgur.com/yZ4Qq95.png
[09:21:49] <BillCriswell> decx: They're relevant to my interests.
[09:21:51] <duch_kazatel> just a nice cohesive experience.
[09:22:05] <duch_kazatel> and the email bodies are nice and short.
[09:22:24] <decx> ah, nice
[09:22:35] <duch_kazatel> it's small stuff, but it's awesome.
[09:22:55] <decx> mailchimps editor is sweet but customers somehhow think adding a billion images is smart
[09:23:10] <BillCriswell> They email me about a show and they make two very important things easy to do, watch it or put it on my list.
[09:23:14] <BillCriswell> Two big ass buttons.
[09:23:28] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that should be all web design :)
[09:23:38] <BillCriswell> Exactly.
[09:23:44] <Horacsio> the problem here is that the div is turning itself, right? in the example, there’s a button to turn the other div: http://guilhemmarty.com/flippy//
[09:23:54] <BillCriswell> Everyone wants to be google, no one wants to be like google.
[09:24:05] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio the issue is that your event bindings are wrong.
[09:24:14] <duch_kazatel> decx i know a dude at mailchimp.  wonder if they're planning on yelling at people for being dumb with images.
[09:24:33] <krambiorix> hi, when i click my link, i go first in this function but after that, the page moves to another url ... What am i doing wrong ? http://jsfiddle.net/Z5JRq/
[09:24:34] <Horacsio> duch_kazatel: I’m trying to figure it out what that exactly means :)
[09:24:46] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio your first event binding is the only one that ever fires.
[09:24:50] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/17/
[09:25:07] <duch_kazatel> krafm you're changing the URL?
[09:25:15] <duch_kazatel> err, krambiorix
[09:25:20] <BillCriswell> http://blog.frankgarofalo.com/imgupload/simplicity.jpeg truth
[09:25:23] <decx> just spend a day getting familiar with css translate and you won't have to rely on a plugin
[09:26:02] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[09:26:20] <duch_kazatel> this will help you learn to troubleshoot :)
[09:26:23] <d0de> How can I get this to work? http://jsfiddle.net/k4Hud/ it prints the value only when it's an anonymous function inside the handler
[09:26:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/k4Hud/1/
[09:26:57] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, well, the parent (table row) is a link to another page. But this icon should link to another page...
[09:27:06] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, i'm tired, can't explain it very well :s
[09:27:21] <d0de> duch_kazatel, thanks! I didn't actually know you could do that
[09:27:23] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix you're setting window.location.
[09:27:37] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix that's going to take you somewhere else.
[09:27:49] <duch_kazatel> d0de :) kind of nice, isn't it?
[09:27:52] <Horacsio> yes I’m using the FF inspector
[09:28:02] <d0de> duch_kazatel, yes, it is!
[09:29:52] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, no, the page navigates to the href on the table row
[09:30:13] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix could you share your html for this?
[09:37:09] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, it's simple: i have a click handler for the table row and in one cell i have a button that has another click handler. When i click the button , the handler for the table row is fired
[09:37:32] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: stopPropogation.
[09:37:37] <BillCriswell> or however you spell that word.
[09:37:47] <duch_kazatel> stopImmediatePropagation()
[09:37:49] <duch_kazatel> see if that helps.
[09:37:54] <BillCriswell> What's wrong with .stopBubbleBitch()
[09:38:15] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, that's it!
[09:38:21] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, yes
[09:43:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: You still using a standing desk?
[09:43:40] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:43:42] <duch_kazatel> you?
[09:43:49] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:43:55] <BillCriswell> I keep reading I shouldn't stand ALL day though.
[09:44:00] <dfsd> yo, can u guys help me out with one thing ?
[09:44:06] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ dfsd
[09:44:06] <b-ot> dfsd: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:44:11] <lolmaus> `.animate({height: 'auto'})` does not display the animation, it triggers immediately like `.css()`. At the same time, `.slideDown()` animates nicely without fixing the height. So how do i do `.animate({height: 'auto'})` with animation like `.slideDown()`?
[09:44:14] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell woah what?
[09:44:18] <BillCriswell> so I'm not sure which is better, standing all day or sitting all day.
[09:44:19] <Horacsio> still insisting :) the issue is that click…
[09:44:26] <dfsd> ok
[09:44:41] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio we told you how to fix it, and decx gave you a working example.
[09:44:43] <dfsd> so I have this mobile style navigation: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10626022/demo/index.html
[09:44:48] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah, apparently standing for 8 hours straight is bad.
[09:44:59] <BillCriswell> I don't know who to believe, damn internet.
[09:45:04] <dfsd> I d like to create another one beaneath it
[09:45:05] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i mean, i don't stand ALL day.  i'm probably 70/30 at this point.
[09:45:10] <Horacsio> I don’t know how to bind the handler :S
[09:45:23] <dfsd> how can I make it work in jquery ?
[09:45:23] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Really? Shit. I'm standing 100%.
[09:45:31] <Horacsio> I know decx gave me a working example...
[09:46:07] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio okay, what about that example aren't you understanding?  the text is just one of many things you can use for your check.
[09:46:16] <decx> settle down with the highlights i'm in a call ^^
[09:46:20] <Horacsio> I know I’m not addressing correctly the 2nd click
[09:46:21] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[09:46:45] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell oh jesus.  i mean, like, there are days where i'm almost 100% and others where i'm way less.  dunno if i could do 100%.
[09:46:45] <Horacsio> because it is the same div…
[09:47:09] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio right.  so you need to check within the current event handler.
[09:47:16] <Horacsio> that’s why I think I need a clicable div to flip nested divs…
[09:47:32] <duch_kazatel> why isn't the previous example good enough?
[09:47:41] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I have no problem standing all day. It's really weird. I'm not even in good shapre.
[09:47:46] <Horacsio> it checks a word...
[09:48:01] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio right - you could check all kinds of things.  text is one option of many.
[09:48:16] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell woah really?  do you have one of those special mats?
[09:48:24] <Horacsio> so you say I allways need to check something, right?
[09:48:38] <Horacsio> I can’t just use the reverse as is, right?
[09:48:42] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Nope. Just a rug.
[09:49:04] <BillCriswell> I wonder if I could do a whole day on one leg.
[09:49:05] <Horacsio> since the flipping “button” is the same as the reverse fliping “button”
[09:49:14] <Horacsio> button=div
[09:49:31] <Horacsio> right?
[09:49:48] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio if your code is to flip a single element and your handler is on that element, then yes.
[09:49:58] <duch_kazatel> you have to check some condition, becuase of the way the binding works.
[09:50:09] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell: getting weird with standing desks
[09:50:43] <BillCriswell> Oh yeah!
[09:50:53] <Horacsio> ok I thought that reverse() already checked if the flip has been done! :)
[09:51:03] <Horacsio> but it doesnt!
[09:51:23] <Horacsio> it just says to go back in the animation…
[09:51:24] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio that reverse method only reverses the last action performed.
[09:51:40] <Horacsio> ok
[09:51:59] <Horacsio> duch_kazatel: thank you and sorry about all mess...
[09:52:26] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio it's fine, but you really should read that link i sent earlier.  it'll help you in cases like this.
[09:52:38] <decx> there's a callback onFinish: function(){ $(this).addClass('flipped')} and then in the handler if ($(this).hasClass('flipped'))
[09:52:42] <Horacsio> that about debuging?
[09:52:48] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio yes.
[09:53:07] <Horacsio> I did and I used inspector to understand what happened
[09:53:58] <Horacsio> but I allways have a distorted way of seeing things. at least differently from what developers do :) and I think I mess my self or the others :)
[09:54:19] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio hrm?  you just need to build up that basic level of understanding.
[09:56:53] <Horacsio> ok next step checking a div
[09:56:54] <decx> Horacsio http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Y5YaK/18/
[09:57:33] <Horacsio> well decx VERY VERY VERY THANKFULL I AM
[10:00:44] <Horacsio> but you see in here http://guilhemmarty.com/flippy/ the content flips allong with the div, why not in my case?
[10:01:20] <decx> blame canada
[10:01:56] <Horacsio> canada?!
[10:05:16] <decx> times have changed, our code is getting worse, it wont obey our patterns it just wants to bare our purse. should we blame the government or blame society, or should we blame the peope in #jquery - no - blame canada... blame canada!
[10:05:37] <derpiebird> is this correct jquery? http://pastebin.com/MrbLfD35
[10:06:15] <duch_kazatel> terribly formatted.
[10:06:26] <duch_kazatel> and no, not "correct"
[10:07:07] <derpiebird> like i thought then
[10:07:38] <derpiebird> typing on onscreen keyboard so i might respond horribly slow
[10:08:18] <derpiebird> but the purpose of it, will it work if i rewrite?
[10:08:39] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[10:09:59] <derpiebird> set html of .message-timestamp if chatMsg contains a textmsg and if .author is a certain name
[10:10:25] <derpiebird> all of them are children of .1337
[10:11:43] <duch_kazatel> i'd use some .find() action in there probably.
[10:12:02] <duch_kazatel> something like this:
[10:12:03] <duch_kazatel> $('.1337').find('.chatMsg:contains("atextbit")').find('.message-author:contains("authorname")').find('.message-timestamp').html('helluuuuu');
[10:12:06] <duch_kazatel> though that's still ugly.
[10:12:40] <derpiebird> is there a 'neat' way of doing it? xD
[10:12:59] <duch_kazatel> are you in control of the server?
[10:13:11] <derpiebird> yep
[10:13:27] <duch_kazatel> then do the processing server-side instead.
[10:13:57] <derpiebird> cant, server only provides data, no html or so
[10:14:10] <duch_kazatel> in json format?
[10:14:23] <duch_kazatel> because you could always add a new property or whatever to the relevant bit.
[10:14:28] <derpiebird> its not meant to do those kinds of processing
[10:14:32] <derpiebird> yes json
[10:14:52] <derpiebird> yea i could, but prefer not to
[10:15:08] <derpiebird> too much else going on already
[10:15:20] <duch_kazatel> uh...
[10:15:28] <duch_kazatel> this is a prime candidate for server-side work.
[10:16:13] <derpiebird> ye, but it would mess alot up
[10:16:24] <derpiebird> already looked into it
[10:16:43] <duch_kazatel> then you're doing something very strange.  you should be able to extend it to do that without needing to rewrite a bunch of code.
[10:17:00] <derpiebird> thx for your help though, will peak in server code again
[10:17:00] <duch_kazatel> if you really HAVE to use a frontend solution, could you share some example html?
[10:17:28] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: You sound like a homeless person asking for code.
[10:17:29] <derpiebird> dont have time with this onscreen keyboard shit, sorry
[10:17:42] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hahaha.
[10:17:59] <a_homeless_man> i'll takle whatever code you got!!
[10:18:28] <BillCriswell> Damn right.
[10:27:37] <Ownix> Im messing with a new plugin for JQuery called DateTimePicker and im trying to set a start date using momentJS via this http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/#startdateex
[10:27:59] <Lindrian> I have a reference to an object in the DOM which in this case is a <div> tag. Inside of it are two <i> tags, how do I fetch those two separately through the reference I have?
[10:28:03] <Ownix> Can someone explain how '+1971/05/01' turns into Aug 5 2015
[10:28:19] <duch_kazatel> Lindrian .find('li')
[10:28:29] <Lindrian> that gets me the first or second one?
[10:28:30] <Lindrian> or btoh?
[10:28:33] <Lindrian> both*
[10:28:37] <Ownix> Lindrian: can i see a fiddle
[10:28:43] <duch_kazatel> $theObject.find('li') for both.  you can use .eq() or .filter()
[10:28:46] <Ownix> there a few ways to get first, second, last index ect
[10:28:57] <Lindrian> alright duch_kazatel
[10:29:00] <Ownix> annnnd duch_kazatel is all over it as usual lol
[10:29:03] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:29:18] <Lindrian> $(parent).find('i').eq(1);
[10:29:21] <Lindrian> i guess?
[10:29:27] <Ownix> Anyways duch_kazatel have you ever seen time done with a "+" in front of it like this  '+1971/05/01'?
[10:29:30] <duch_kazatel> .eq(0) for the first one.
[10:29:36] <Ownix> Lindrian: 0 based index
[10:29:38] <duch_kazatel> Ownix nope.
[10:29:41] <Lindrian> Righto
[10:29:50] <duch_kazatel> Lindrian or .find('li')[0]
[10:30:07] <Ownix> Lindrian: ^ that works due to find returning an array
[10:30:15] <duch_kazatel> *array-like object.
[10:30:23] <Lindrian> great
[10:30:25] <Lindrian> thanks
[10:30:33] <Ownix> Or whatever the self evolving robots that write jquery call it
[10:30:36] <duch_kazatel> the object jquery tosses back isn't a true array, but it supports most methods/etc.
[10:32:01] <Lindrian> Can .removeClass() remove several classes at once?
[10:32:06] <Lindrian> .removeClass("a, b, c")
[10:32:32] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/removeClass/ "More than one class may be removed at a time, separated by a space, from the set of matched elements..."
[10:32:36] <decx> there, couldnt resist http://i.imgur.com/ogrFoOp.png
[10:32:41] <Lindrian> cool
[10:32:42] <duch_kazatel> .removeClass("a b c")
[10:32:50] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[10:32:54] <duch_kazatel> all day erry day
[10:39:36] <kirillinfinite> how can I select a frame name ?
[10:41:49] <marc_v92> kirillinfinite: $("frame[name='nameOfFrame']");
[10:42:00] <kirillinfinite> oh great, thanks
[10:42:14] <kirillinfinite> so if this frame is inside of an iframe .. do I have to select iframe first ?
[10:42:21] <kirillinfinite> sorry for the n00b questions :D
[10:42:50] <erming> "ima do a small refactor".. turned into 10 hour marathon overhaul.. oh why
[10:42:59] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery contents
[10:43:00] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .contents() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/contents/
[10:43:10] <duch_kazatel> kirillinfinite check that sucker out.
[10:43:53] <erming> $("#iframe").contents().find("#inner_iframe").contents(), something like it
[10:45:39] <kirillinfinite> great! thanks! :)
[10:47:16] <duch_kazatel> erming i'm right there with you ATM.
[10:48:13] <duch_kazatel> holy woah 57 lines and it's all wrong.
[10:49:36] <erming> Heh.. Made an application with Backbone.. Now I'm not using Backbone anymore
[10:49:45] <erming> The problem was.. I had to redo alot of the code.. wups :>
[10:50:15] <duch_kazatel> in our case, somebody built out an include and used IDs in it.
[10:50:22] <duch_kazatel> this include can be on a page more than once.
[11:00:08] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[11:00:15] <Starcraftmazter> i have a container element with divs
[11:00:24] <Starcraftmazter> how can i find out which numnber div a certain one is?
[11:00:29] <Starcraftmazter> ie, 1..2..3..4..5, etc
[11:00:34] <Starcraftmazter> inside the container
[11:00:53] <MikeD_> nth-child?
[11:01:17] <MikeD_> what do you mean by "find out" ?
[11:01:28] <MikeD_> i mean, you should be able to count them pretty easily
[11:01:44] <duch_kazatel> he wants to know if the current element is the third div
[11:02:12] <MikeD_> ok, but 3rd in what collection?
[11:02:24] <Starcraftmazter> dynamically created divs, etc
[11:02:27] <decx> anytime you go through a collection of elements be it with each or with css you can access the index
[11:02:28] <duch_kazatel> relative to the parent :) of the current children.
[11:02:36] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/index/ is one way to skin that cat.
[11:02:51] <Starcraftmazter> the big picture is i have rows of x divs, and for each, it needs a "more info" div, which must be shifted past the end of the row
[11:02:55] <MikeD_> assuming the iterator uses the source-order, that'd be exactly perfect
[11:03:16] <duch_kazatel> Starcraftmazter instead of "the big picture", could you share some code?
[11:03:30] <Starcraftmazter> not really, its inside wordpress and a big mess
[11:03:40] <Starcraftmazter> theres like 30 less files to go with it, not including bootstrap
[11:03:44] <Starcraftmazter> well not a mess, just a project
[11:03:50] <MikeD_> then make a succinct little picture in a jsfiddle.net  :)
[11:03:50] <tudda> I have an issue reported that when a user clicks enter in a textbox, it's not saving properly. Im trying to determine which button is being "clicked" when the user hits enter.. but I'm not finding anything via google that tells how to determine this
[11:03:56] <duch_kazatel> why do people refuse to make use-cases.
[11:04:03] <Starcraftmazter> well it would take ages
[11:04:05] <Starcraftmazter> but hold on
[11:04:27] <BillCriswell> .container>div{Div $}*4
[11:04:27] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/jdBbL/
[11:04:28] <Velveeta> everybody thinks they have to duplicate 100% of their setup to demonstrate a specific question
[11:04:41] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta yeah i kind of don't understand why.
[11:04:41] <MikeD_> duch_kazatel: because the collective experience of all the king's men (and women) in this channel have already seen every use-case ever
[11:04:42] <Velveeta> we only need to see a simple demonstrate that highlights what you're looking to know
[11:05:05] <duch_kazatel> tudda an event binding.
[11:05:11] <Velveeta> tudda: e.which will give you the keycode that was pressed, enter is 13
[11:05:28] <erming> Starcraftmazter: you need the index on the iteration of elements? like this? $("div").each(function(i, el) { }); // i will start at 0..1 2 3 4 etc
[11:05:35] <duch_kazatel> Starcraftmazter so you want to know that the div with the text "div two" is the "second" div in that group.
[11:06:10] <duch_kazatel> because the problem you later described didn't require this kind of logic at all.
[11:06:37] * Velveeta gives duch_kazatel the thumbs-up.
[11:06:54] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/vijarufo/1/edit?html,js,output EWWW
[11:06:59] <BillCriswell> WEEE* even
[11:07:08] <duch_kazatel> WWWE ?
[11:07:10] <duch_kazatel> D:
[11:07:17] <decx> hehe 11
[11:07:18] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/vijarufo/2/edit OOPS
[11:07:58] <Velveeta> wait a minute, i'm clicking on div 41 and it's only telling me 4.. something's wrong
[11:08:16] <Starcraftmazter> duch_kazatel:  Velveeta:  erming:  http://pastebin.com/1abti4mD
[11:08:53] <Starcraftmazter> so, assuming i know how many divs are to a row on a given screen width, i need to know how many divs are past the one i am iterating over, so that i know how many elements to shift the hidden divs forward
[11:08:55] <Starcraftmazter> if that makes sense
[11:09:28] <Velveeta> how are you calculating the number of divs in a row based on screen width?
[11:09:30] <duch_kazatel> you're re-ordering content based on screen width?
[11:09:50] <Starcraftmazter> Velveeta: actually im not, im going by the top offset, and as soon as it changes, i know they are on the next row
[11:09:53] <BillCriswell> I fixededed it Velveeta.
[11:09:54] <Starcraftmazter> duch_kazatel: yes
[11:10:00] <decx> what like that failed experiment that was googles inline preview in image search?
[11:10:06] <Velveeta> billcriswell: i know, i was screwing with you :
[11:10:40] <Starcraftmazter> so far im thinking ill add a class to the current iterating element so i know which it is
[11:10:47] <erming> Starcraftmazter: i think i would just duplicate these Hidden Content-divs
[11:10:47] <Starcraftmazter> then add how many until the top offset changes
[11:10:48] <MikeD_> where is window.status displayed in firefox?
[11:10:50] <duch_kazatel> Starcraftmazter you don't need to do that.
[11:10:53] <erming> instead of moving them around
[11:11:01] <BillCriswell> I'm sensitive.
[11:11:08] <Starcraftmazter> erming: i dont see how that helps, and its also messy
[11:11:10] <Starcraftmazter> no duplication
[11:11:15] <duch_kazatel> Starcraftmazter if you're enumerating via an .each(), $(this) refers to the current element.
[11:11:18] <Velveeta> i don't window.status has long-since been done away with, miked_
[11:11:39] <Starcraftmazter> duch_kazatel: wont it be $(this) for inside the each?
[11:11:39] <Velveeta> er i *think*
[11:11:48] <Starcraftmazter> i cant do $(this) == $(this)
[11:11:50] <Starcraftmazter> doesnt make sense
[11:11:53] <duch_kazatel> Starcraftmazter wat
[11:12:01] <duch_kazatel> you're convoluting things.
[11:12:20] <Velveeta> also, given this current setup, i don't think there's any room to declare someone else's solution "messy" :D
[11:12:26] <decx> that's definitely true ... eheheh
[11:12:49] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/jdBbL/1/
[11:12:50] <Velveeta> so let's get to the heart of the matter, what exactly are you trying to do with this hidden content
[11:12:53] <duch_kazatel> i mean... y'know.
[11:13:01] <Velveeta> display to the right of a given 'row'?
[11:13:27] <Velveeta> and is it only ever gonna display one at a time, or can it display more than one?
[11:13:40] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a job for media queries imo.
[11:13:49] <Starcraftmazter> one at a time, it takes up a whole row, thats why
[11:14:02] <Starcraftmazter> if you know of a way to do this in media queries AND have it be responsive, by all means tell me
[11:14:05] <Starcraftmazter> but afaik its impossible
[11:14:14] <Starcraftmazter> as the number of rows changes with device screen width
[11:14:17] <Starcraftmazter> so the dom has to change
[11:14:30] <Velveeta> so, wait.. you have a 'row' of visible content, which you want hidden content displayed to the right of, but the hidden content takes up a whole row per content item?
[11:14:33] <duch_kazatel> the point of media queries is for responsiveness.  you can show/hide things instead.
[11:15:07] <Velveeta> also, the dom doesn't have to change, that's exactly the sort of thing floated elements were made for
[11:15:13] <Starcraftmazter> Velveeta: there are rows of visible tiles, when you click on a tile, below that row of tiles, a row width "more info" div appears
[11:15:34] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: Like iTunes album viewer thingie?
[11:15:41] <Starcraftmazter> ive never used itunes
[11:15:55] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: I took a stab at it a while ago, might help: http://jsbin.com/IbeGIlO/5/edit
[11:16:04] <decx> like in the google image search thing that was active for a few weeks
[11:16:16] <duch_kazatel> oh that?  i was not a fan.
[11:16:16] <BillCriswell> decx: Oh, this might actually be close to what you want.
[11:16:20] <Starcraftmazter> yes thats exact;ly right
[11:16:26] <Starcraftmazter> plus responsiveness
[11:16:26] <decx> before they shelved it because it's shite
[11:16:33] <Starcraftmazter> so the row could be 4, 2 or 1 tile
[11:16:36] <BillCriswell> It is responsive.
[11:16:45] <BillCriswell> A little ownky on load though oddly enough.
[11:16:57] <erming> oink oink
[11:17:01] <duch_kazatel> how in the world is it always that BillCriswell just "took a stab at" these crazy things "a while ago"?
[11:17:29] <duch_kazatel> like, somebody comes in with something weird/crazy and BillCriswell had just gotten done doing basically whatever it is.
[11:17:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I have no idea.
[11:17:48] <decx> and yes, you go through the next few siblings and check their offset to top, once you reach a sibling with higher offset you found the new row
[11:18:05] <Velveeta> billcriswell is privy to some random code repository that has a solution for everything, which we know nothing about, and he just copies and pastes them into jsbin
[11:18:07] <BillCriswell> Oh shit I even have keyboard navigation in here.
[11:18:17] <Starcraftmazter> BillCriswell: what class is the black box?
[11:18:52] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: .info?
[11:19:39] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta ++
[11:20:28] <Starcraftmazter> where does your info live
[11:20:56] <dsol> Im trying to run an ajax request, and upon fail (304) try another one. It never does. Anyone know why? http://jsfiddle.net/D8kQf/
[11:20:56] <MikeD_> Velveeta: this is like what I'd have used window.status for:  http://jsbin.com/vijarufo/6/edit  (you have to open the output into it's own window to see)
[11:20:57] <BillCriswell> I just generate it randomly.
[11:21:20] <decx> bill is actually 5000 monkeys with typewriters
[11:21:31] <duch_kazatel> this explains so much.
[11:21:39] <decx> the standing desk for one
[11:21:57] <decx> that way the janitor can sweep through the rows to pick up poop
[11:21:58] <duch_kazatel> and the rest ARE the standing desk.
[11:22:07] <BillCriswell> Haha. As soon as I see something I'm not sure how it works I just try it.
[11:23:23] <BillCriswell> You know what was annoying me about this? Making a little arrow pointing to the active album.
[11:23:31] <BillCriswell> I couldn't think of a clean way to approach it.
[11:24:12] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/IbeGIlO/8/edit?js,output here it is without the off at startup.
[11:24:28] <Velveeta> miked_: i don't see anything in that jsbin using window.status
[11:24:52] <Velveeta> "bill is actually 5000 monkeys with typewriters" -- bill is the angularjs team?
[11:24:54] <BillCriswell> I had really big ideas for this demo. I wanted to use real album covers and use this to generate the colors: http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/
[11:25:02] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta lmao
[11:25:10] <Velveeta> i keed, i keed!
[11:25:15] <MikeD_> Velveeta: right, if it's ancient history, i'll use document.title for the same unintrusive monitor (mouseover notification with alerts are weird)
[11:25:33] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha
[11:25:37] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: Either way I hope that helps!
[11:26:02] <Velveeta> yeah, people used to use mouseover/mouseout w/ window.status to hide the addresses of anchors as people moused over the, etc... as far as i know, that behavior's been gone for years
[11:27:03] <duch_kazatel> dsol are you getting any console errors/etc?
[11:28:04] <dsol> yes. 503 error
[11:28:51] <duch_kazatel> dsol so you never hit your .fail()?
[11:29:02] <dsol> Doesnt seem like it
[11:29:10] <BillCriswell> DUH
[11:29:26] <dsol> I never get "Trying second source instead"
[11:29:27] <BillCriswell> Just figured out a way to do those stupid arrows.
[11:30:11] <BillCriswell> I am an idiot.
[11:31:13] <Velveeta> what does that have to do with your arrows?
[11:31:17] <Velveeta> zing!
[11:31:32] <Starcraftmazter> BillCriswell: does a bit, i think i did it
[11:31:34] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[11:31:34] <duch_kazatel> dsol it's working for me.
[11:31:37] <Starcraftmazter> using my crazy method
[11:32:19] <dsol> duch_kazatel: from the second source?
[11:32:54] <duch_kazatel> dsol i'm seeing the console log ont he fail of the first.
[11:34:16] <dsol> duch_kazatel: yes, but do you get the time from the second source?
[11:34:19] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/IbeGIlO/9/edit there we go.
[11:34:31] <duch_kazatel> dsol http://jsfiddle.net/2wf6H/ i'm seeing the .fail() trigger here.
[11:34:36] <duch_kazatel> and then i'm getting a second error.
[11:36:14] <dsol> duch_kazatel: I see. May there be some settings on my web server?
[11:36:26] <duch_kazatel> dsol huh?
[11:36:32] <duch_kazatel> dsol are you familiar with the console?
[11:37:12] <dsol> yes
[11:37:22] <duch_kazatel> okay - do you see the error in the fiddle?
[11:37:57] <dsol> duch_kazatel: yes, and also "Trying second source instead"
[11:38:24] <dsol> Which I dont get on my web server
[11:39:04] <BillCriswell> Do you guys design so things look good AS you resize? Like with this: http://jsbin.com/IbeGIlO/9/edit does the arrow still being visible bother you?
[11:39:05] <duch_kazatel> dsol then the first get is your first problem it looks like.
[11:40:05] <dsol> duch_kazatel: the code should work even if the first source is down. This is to make redundancy
[11:40:20] <duch_kazatel> i am aware - I can read :)
[11:40:54] <dsol> So what should I do?
[11:40:59] <Velveeta> me eat lunch and want now brain sleep
[11:41:12] <duch_kazatel> dsol i'd step through to see wtf is going on.
[11:41:15] <MikeD_> mmm carbs
[11:41:24] <duch_kazatel> dsol also - what version of jquery are you using?
[11:41:31] <hooliogan132> I keep thinking im in #lad and then wonderign how the heck there is some much talk of javascript lol
[11:41:51] <duch_kazatel> hah
[11:43:20] <dsol> duch_kazatel: 1.8.3
[11:44:12] <BillCriswell> Did Velveeta call me a monkey?
[11:44:37] <Velveeta> nope, somebody else did, i just repurposed that statement
[11:44:50] <BillCriswell> Well I was going to say thanks.
[11:44:52] <duch_kazatel> dsol interesting.  that fails in the fiddle if i use that version.
[11:44:53] <Velveeta> oo oo, ah ah
[11:45:03] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:46:07] <duch_kazatel> why doesn't a 503 register as an error for a .fail()
[11:46:16] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/D8kQf/1/
[11:46:39] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[11:46:42] <duch_kazatel> and now i lunch brb
[11:47:04] <BillCriswell> It successfully figured out the service wasn't available? I dunno.
[11:47:20] <relipse> quick what is the best plugin for restricting input to integers only
[11:47:25] <duch_lunch> btw change the jquery version to something more recent and it works
[11:47:33] <Velveeta> relipse: true!
[11:47:33] <duch_lunch> relipse none because we have numbers not integers.
[11:47:42] <relipse> ?
[11:47:49] <duch_lunch> >:D
[11:48:00] <Velveeta> you could always use the pattern attribute.. don't need a whole plugin, depending on what browsers you're supporting
[11:48:02] <duch_lunch> javascript number types are neat.  and now i feed.
[11:48:07] <hooliogan132> hoo hoo hoo hoo
[11:48:10] <relipse> velveeta oh good idea
[11:49:16] <BillCriswell> relipse: $('.numbers-only').on('input', function() { $(this).val( $(this).val().replace(/[^0-9]/g, '') ); }); ?!
[11:49:25] <relipse> i think pattern is best idea
[11:49:28] <relipse> thanks
[11:49:46] <BillCriswell> YOUR WELCOME STARCRAFTMAZTER
[11:49:50] <BillCriswell> YOU'RE*
[11:49:56] <BillCriswell> I should go to bed.
[11:50:11] <BillCriswell> I wonder if I just got that guy a bonus.
[11:50:20] <MikeD_> what timezone are you in?
[11:50:27] <BillCriswell> It's only 3PM MikeD_.
[11:50:47] <BillCriswell> EST
[11:50:51] <BillCriswell> -5 I think?
[11:50:53] <MikeD_> yeah, was wondering about the regional lunch meat thing + going to bed at 3p  :)
[11:50:57] <relipse> actually i want it live velveeta
[11:51:02] <relipse> not after they click submit
[11:51:12] <relipse> like billcriswwell gave
[11:51:21] <relipse> maybe i'll use the patter attribute with what bill did
[11:51:26] <BillCriswell> I was right!
[11:51:37] <BillCriswell> With the -5 thing.
[11:51:44] <relipse> -5 ?
[11:51:47] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: 3pm is EDT (-4) :)
[11:51:50] <BillCriswell> -5 UTC
[11:52:04] <BillCriswell> Clocks. How do they work.
[11:52:33] <Velveeta> sun goes down, sun comes up, you can't explain that
[11:52:41] <BillCriswell> marc_v92: I got ya!
[11:52:47] <hooliogan132> I am proper pissed today so many problems so little time so many complications making small problems just go on for ever ... and then last night my internet started dicking around and all my unbacked up code got zapped by winscp and then on my quest to find out if theres a way to undelete via cpanel or something i discover theres cpremote backup thing that only activates the daily/weekly backing
[11:52:47] <hooliogan132> up after you visit it for the first time.. i was like nooooo why is that chit just not on automatically!!!!!!!!!!
[11:54:06] <BillCriswell> hey hooliogan132
[11:55:06] <hooliogan132> any way i learned my leason i got a bitbucket now and will obviously always in future visit that cpremote backup thing if the host/cpanels got it heh and managed to get away with it by the skin of my teeth i had a slightly older but still fairly complete version on another webserver
[12:00:53] <relipse> how do I negate a regular expression pattern
[12:01:17] <relipse> i want to use BillCriswell 's function only with a reverse-pattern
[12:01:27] <relipse> so \d would allow digits
[12:01:35] <relipse> and replace everything else with ""
[12:01:38] <BillCriswell> relipse: You can remove the ^
[12:01:48] <BillCriswell> Wait.
[12:01:51] <relipse> no bill i'm getting a pattern variable i have to negate it
[12:02:19] <BillCriswell> [^0-9] would select anything that's not a number, [0-9] would only select a number.
[12:02:32] <relipse> i know but my pattern can be anything such as [\d]
[12:02:38] <relipse> \d\d\d
[12:02:48] <relipse> how do i get rid of non matches or something
[12:03:02] <BillCriswell> You lost me I think.
[12:03:19] <relipse> i have a select box with 10 options, each option has a pattern allowed
[12:03:25] <BillCriswell> Right right.
[12:03:29] <relipse> which i'm going to feed into your on('input')
[12:03:44] <relipse> but i can't do it because it is negated
[12:03:47] <BillCriswell> Aight.
[12:04:25] <BillCriswell> Give me example input and example output.
[12:04:30] <BillCriswell> The only way I understand shit half the time.
[12:04:36] <relipse> i want to make it generic
[12:05:11] <relipse> and i wanted to make it compatible with the html5 pattern= tag
[12:05:13] <relipse> attribute i mean
[12:05:37] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[12:06:16] <relipse> basically enhance the pattern= attribute
[12:06:22] <relipse> to be on input
[12:06:29] <relipse> instead of on form submit
[12:08:18] <BillCriswell> That might get ugly quick.
[12:08:55] <relipse> yeah its not working i'll just use your version then
[12:10:44] <jaccob> I heard jquery is not so indispensible anymore if you do not support IE8 and down?
[12:11:59] <greendot> lo ppl
[12:12:07] <computerex> hello guys. I want to convert a string to a date. Like for example, I have "4/12/2014" and I want to convert that to "April 12th, 2014"
[12:12:12] <greendot> when you have $('something').animate({opacity: 0}) this opacity setting is the beginning or the end of animation?
[12:12:30] <computerex> is there a way to easily do that in jQuery/javascript or do I have to roll my own?
[12:13:41] <BillCriswell> computerex: You'd have to roll your own. I'd recommend Moment.js  if you're working with a lot of date related stuff.
[12:14:11] <jaccob> computerex, native js even has a date object
[12:14:27] <greendot> hmm i think you can use ($.format.date(new Date(), 'dd M yy'));
[12:14:29] <computerex> Billcriswell - do you know how to do what I asked with moment?
[12:14:52] <BillCriswell> greendot: Is that core jquer?
[12:15:04] <greendot> try it Bill
[12:15:46] <greendot> so, that opacity is the beginning or the end of animation?
[12:16:07] <greendot> someone knows
[12:16:19] <BillCriswell> greendot: I get date is undefined.
[12:16:45] <greendot> $("something").val($.format.date(new Date(), 'dd M yy'));
[12:17:23] <BillCriswell> greendot: Right, undefined.
[12:18:05] <greendot> you can try a datepicker
[12:18:23] <greendot> $("something").val($.datepicker.formatDate('dd M yy', new Date()));
[12:18:48] <greendot> I dont mess with Jquery/js since quite a few time
[12:18:54] <greendot> Forgot a bunch of stuff
[12:18:59] <BillCriswell> Got ya.
[12:19:08] <greendot> worked?
[12:20:10] <greendot> I think its the end of animation
[12:20:12] <BillCriswell> greendot: Did not.
[12:20:16] <greendot> someone can confirm it?
[12:20:24] <greendot> Its not working on IE
[12:20:29] <greendot> need to install chrome
[12:20:49] <greendot> you doing something wrong Bill
[12:22:28] <greendot> var formattedDate = new Date("yourUnformattedOriginalDate"); var d = formattedDate.getDate();  var m =  formattedDate.getMonth();  m += 1;  // JavaScript months are 0-11  var y = formattedDate.getFullYear();
[12:22:36] <BillCriswell> computerex: moment("4/12/2014", "MM-DD-YYYY").format('MMMM Mo, YYYY');
[12:22:39] <greendot> $("#txtDate").val(d + "." + m + "." + y);
[12:22:44] <greendot> try all that
[12:22:50] <greendot> thats anti-dummy
[12:22:53] <greendot> :D
[12:23:27] <greendot> cant explain better
[12:23:40] <BillCriswell> greendot: lol
[12:23:45] <BillCriswell> I know how to do it.
[12:23:53] <greendot> :D
[12:23:59] <greendot> doesnt seem like you do
[12:24:01] <greendot> :D
[12:24:32] <greendot> so no1 can help on my issue?
[12:24:50] <BillCriswell> computerex: moment("4/12/2014", "MM-DD-YYYY").format('MMMM Do, YYYY'); Changed Mo to Do.
[12:25:32] <greendot> okidodki
[12:25:35] <greendot> thx anyways
[12:25:45] <BillCriswell> greendot: Why don't you try it and see?
[12:25:58] <greendot> its not workin on IE
[12:26:16] <greendot> i dont have chrome on this machine or FF
[12:26:25] <BillCriswell> You can't just say "It's not workin'" You need to say what isn't working, share your erroor.
[12:27:01] <innociv_> How do I get the mouse event outside of .mousemove()?  I want to attach .position() from jquery ui to the mouse inside a function with no mousemove event
[12:27:31] <greendot> outside of mousemove?
[12:27:35] <greendot> dont get it
[12:29:09] <greendot> ok issue solved, its working on chrome
[12:29:43] <innociv_> nevermind I figure out a way to do it.
[12:30:02] <greendot> sorry I dont get your issue
[12:32:05] <greendot> So Bill, its working now or what
[12:32:20] <duch_lunch> weeee
[12:32:27] <innociv_> http://pastebin.com/XYadUU3p
[12:32:33] <innociv_> That is the solution
[12:33:02] <BillCriswell> lol
[12:33:15] <greendot> if you cant get it with all these steps, man...something very wrong:D
[12:33:20] <innociv_> ?
[12:33:33] <duch_kazatel> use .on() and not .bind
[12:33:37] <innociv_> Why?
[12:33:46] <duch_kazatel> because .bind() is deprecated.
[12:34:02] <duch_kazatel> wait you're just trying to get the mouse event?
[12:34:04] <innociv_> Huh. Why didn't they just recode .bind() to be the same as .on()
[12:34:05] <innociv_> yes
[12:34:13] <greendot> just on js/jq, still very used on c#
[12:34:30] <innociv_> Better than keeping a mouse listener and constantly setting a variable every time the mouse is moved. Here I just get it when it's needed
[12:34:33] <duch_kazatel> innociv_ they deprecate things and shuffle them around all the time.
[12:34:46] <duch_kazatel> innociv_ when do you need the mouse event?
[12:35:05] <innociv_> looks like one() is what I should use.
[12:35:14] <innociv_> I only need the mouse event at very specific times.
[12:35:21] <duch_kazatel> like on specific elements?>
[12:35:23] <innociv_> Thus I don't like the idea of constantly listening and updating a variable
[12:35:24] <innociv_> Yes
[12:35:29] <duch_kazatel> event delegation.
[12:35:35] <greendot> indeed
[12:35:40] <BillCriswell> greendot: Yeah dude I'm almost there.
[12:35:42] <innociv_> Eh the way my code is structured, it'd be a pain to pass it.
[12:35:55] <innociv_> Here, let me describe what is happening.
[12:35:57] <duch_kazatel> innociv_ not really - what you're doing now is pretty convoluted.
[12:36:08] <greendot> need to move on
[12:36:09] <greendot> cya
[12:36:23] <BillCriswell> What a troll.
[12:36:27] <duch_kazatel> what happened?
[12:36:39] <nfenton> anyone used parallaxjs before with ios safari
[12:36:45] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ nfenton
[12:36:45] <b-ot> nfenton: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:37:06] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Just a hunch... I think they're pretty good at it, though.
[12:37:09] <nfenton> !ask anyone used parallaxjs before with ios safari
[12:37:20] <duch_kazatel> nfenton read what the bot said...
[12:37:32] <innociv_> I have a window like a drop down box. When you click some elements, a function is called like attachDropdown($targetElement, callback());  But sometimes that element is hidden when it's clicked, and .position() can't get its position then. In that case I'm wanting to attach it to the current cursor position when it's clicked
[12:37:43] <innociv_> So unless the jquery selector for that element contains a mouse event...
[12:37:55] <innociv_> I don't want to pass it into the function
[12:38:17] <duch_kazatel> so you're hiding/showing a dropdown?
[12:38:29] <innociv_> Yes.
[12:38:43] <duch_kazatel> that's easy.  dunno why you need mouse position to handle that.
[12:39:08] <duch_kazatel> guess i'd need to see an example of what you're doing.
[12:39:17] <innociv_> How do you get the mouse position in a vacuum, then?
[12:39:30] <duch_kazatel> i don't know that the mouse position is at all relevant for what you're doing.
[12:39:36] <innociv_> Reread what I said.
[12:39:41] <innociv_> "But sometimes that element is hidden when it's clicked, and .position() can't get its position then"
[12:39:57] <duch_kazatel> right, i can't understand what relevance that has to hiding/showing a dropdown.
[12:39:58] <innociv_> The issue is attaching a drop down for something that is no longer in the pages flow.
[12:40:12] <duch_kazatel> yeah i'd have to see an example.
[12:40:28] <innociv_> K just trust me, I know this is what I need to do.
[12:40:37] <duch_kazatel> i have doubts, but okay :)
[12:43:35] <mechamjoseph> hey this is a pretty noob question, but do siblings() have to be the same thing?
[12:43:41] <innociv_> Huh. My code works in returning the mouse event, but of:event isn't putting it there.
[12:43:42] <innociv_> No
[12:43:42] <mechamjoseph> like all <li>
[12:43:50] <innociv_> they don't
[12:43:58] <innociv_> .siblings('li') will get all <li> siblings
[12:44:34] <mechamjoseph> ah
[12:44:49] <mechamjoseph> so… is parents().children.() the exact same as siblings()?
[12:45:13] <shoky> nope
[12:45:26] <mechamjoseph> does parents().children() even work?
[12:45:27] <shoky> .parent().children() is closer but still not exactly
[12:45:35] <shoky> sure
[12:45:37] <mechamjoseph> errr. i meant parent()
[12:45:38] <mechamjoseph> sorry
[12:46:28] <innociv_> ... okay why is .pageX and .pageY undefined on the triggered mousemove? :|
[12:47:09] <innociv_> http://jsfiddle.net/X5KbB/
[12:47:37] <shoky> eh
[12:49:09] <shoky> why would they be defined?
[12:49:17] <shoky> it's not a real mousemove
[12:49:20] <MikeD_> anyone know of any gotcha with vertical centering in IE8 & IE10
[12:49:22] <innociv_> because the mousemove event has pageX and pageY?
[12:49:27] <shoky> no, it doesn't
[12:49:29] <innociv_> http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/
[12:49:31] <shoky> you're triggering it yourself
[12:49:33] <innociv_> ?...
[12:49:38] <duch_kazatel> wat.  you're triggering a custom mousemove event and then triggering it.  that's not a mousemove.
[12:49:39] <innociv_> Welp.
[12:49:55] <innociv_> How am I supposed to get the pagex and pagey of the mouse cursor without .mousemove() triggered naturally?
[12:50:06] <shoky> with mousemove triggered naturally
[12:50:09] <innociv_> lol
[12:50:11] <shoky> ;]
[12:50:16] <innociv_> There has to be another way. That's so inefficient.
[12:50:20] <duch_kazatel> this entire question seems kind of strange.
[12:50:28] <innociv_> This is an amazing question
[12:50:34] <innociv_> To snapshot a mouse position at a point in time
[12:50:53] <innociv_> Who even cares WHY I need it. It's a great question.
[12:51:13] <jhjohnson> because we could help you solve it another way without bashing your head senseless :)
[12:51:36] <duch_kazatel> because whenever i find myself needing a solution like that, i rethink the problem to make sure i haven't coded myself into a corner.
[12:52:24] <jhjohnson> you want to attach a hidden element to the cursor, meaning you want to position that element wherever the cursor is on the page?
[12:52:49] <jhjohnson> like that really bad '95 joke where you couldn't click on the dialog window to close it? it just moved with your mouse
[13:00:10] <innociv_> eh
[13:00:43] <innociv_> There's tons of other situations where I can think of where I'd want to get positin position at a point of time.
[13:01:44] <DarkGhost> hello, I'm loading some stuff using .load, then trying to use a .click() for something that was in that file I loaded but it doesnt seem to be working. any advice?
[13:02:06] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost use event delegation.
[13:02:12] <DarkGhost> whats that
[13:02:18] <duch_kazatel> you're probably trying to bind the listener before the content exists.
[13:02:27] <duch_kazatel> $(parent).on('click', 'child', function(){});
[13:02:51] <duch_kazatel> where parent is the containing element you're loading content into, and child is the selector you WERE targeting in your old click binding.
[13:04:53] <BillCriswell> innociv_: http://jsbin.com/luhey/1/edit?js,output ?
[13:05:15] <innociv_> Inefficent, isn't it?
[13:05:29] <innociv_> Constantly listening and updating an array.
[13:05:34] <BillCriswell> Of course.
[13:06:09] <shoky> constantly listening and just updating two x,y vars is fine though
[13:07:11] <duch_kazatel> that's really not that bad.
[13:07:40] <duch_kazatel> if you were listening and then doing a like $('a').each(); in there, that'd be bad.
[13:08:17] <jhjohnson> maybe throttle it with underscore or lodash throttle
[13:08:31] <jhjohnson> it == the event handler
[13:10:49] <jdo_dk> Would i put a event listener like: $(document).on("something" inside $(function(){....}); or just somewhere in the js ?
[13:11:09] <BillCriswell> jdo_dk: Depends.
[13:12:08] <acidjazz> jdo_dk: depends on when you want that listener
[13:12:26] <jdo_dk> the listener should work on "ajax loaded" content
[13:12:29] <jdo_dk> primary...
[13:12:39] <acidjazz> so you need it after th ajax is loaded
[13:12:45] <jdo_dk> Yes
[13:12:46] <acidjazz> because you cant set a listener on non-existant content
[13:12:55] <duch_kazatel> event delegation.
[13:12:57] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:12:59] <jhjohnson> *cough* delegate
[13:13:02] <acidjazz> so a proper way i organize things
[13:13:09] <acidjazz> is i stick handlers in a handlers method
[13:13:17] <acidjazz> and always write a handler .off mirror
[13:13:23] <duch_kazatel> $(container).on('event', 'child', function(){});
[13:13:24] <acidjazz> so you can remove/refresh upon each ajax load
[13:13:39] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz why are you removing listeners instead of using delegation?
[13:13:50] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: i foudn it to be faster and more efficient
[13:13:55] <duch_kazatel> ... wut
[13:14:02] <duch_kazatel> evidence?
[13:14:10] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: mobile web w/ no page refreshes
[13:14:16] <duch_kazatel> right - delegation.
[13:14:19] <jhjohnson> certainly not faster to code, nor update
[13:14:21] <acidjazz> i have like 8 diff pages that load each 10 diff types of data
[13:14:44] <jhjohnson> you have to write all the extra teardown work so you don't double up on your handlers
[13:14:48] <duch_kazatel> still don't see how manually binding listeners is going to satisfy either of your criteria.
[13:14:53] <jhjohnson> plus you're directly binding to your contnet, so it's super inefficient
[13:14:57] <acidjazz> jhjohnson: thats all uniform
[13:15:15] <duch_kazatel> you're binding multiple listeners where one will suffice though.
[13:15:19] <jhjohnson> now what happens when you've got 1000 of those elements on the page, each with their own handler
[13:15:22] <duch_kazatel> do you have any proof that your way is faster?
[13:15:24] <acidjazz> not me no
[13:15:41] <DarkGhost>              $("#signupbox").on('click', '#signupform :input:not(:submit)',  function(e) { so I have this, but that seems to be giving me some kind of error
[13:15:42] <acidjazz> jhjohnson: i dont make a handler for each element.. thats nuts
[13:16:00] <jhjohnson> the way you're coding does
[13:16:01] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: yea chrome on android doesnt crash for once.. transitions stay stmooth
[13:16:04] <duch_kazatel> darkbasic #signupform :input:not(:submit) seems a little excessive
[13:16:13] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz huh?
[13:16:18] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: i go both ways in general.. but when i get real heavy on mobile ive found this to work
[13:16:23] <jdo_dk> I think i keep my handler inside $(function()... :)
[13:16:28] <jeebster> is it possible to perform mathematical queries with jquery? for example, I'm trying to find all span node elements where the data-number attribute is less than 5
[13:16:33] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel I want every input but submit
[13:16:35] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz i'd love to see some proof.
[13:16:39] <daum> hey guys - i have a similar issue to: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5984066/why-would-this-javascript-be-causing-browser-crashes-from-memory-usage  ...my example i use a bit more as i bind a bunch of variables to the returned data...but am guessing i'm on the same lines...are there any good tools to see where you are losing the memory or things to look for in terms of where to recoup the lost memory?
[13:16:50] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: i wish i had the effort
[13:17:36] <shoky> jeebster: you can do any kind of query you want with .filter(function() { ... })
[13:17:56] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost i'd use filter or add a class or something.
[13:18:18] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel it was working before I added .load
[13:18:20] <DarkGhost> so i know that one works
[13:18:43] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhostd does #signupbox get added/removed?
[13:19:07] <duch_kazatel> also, you said you're getting an error - what is it?
[13:20:06] <duch_kazatel> interesting - acidjazz http://jsperf.com/jquery-delegate-vs-bind-triggering
[13:20:44] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel stuff is geting added to signupbox
[13:20:53] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ DarkGhost
[13:20:53] <b-ot> DarkGhost: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:21:37] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel http://privatepaste.com/76d7d90a7f
[13:21:39] <DarkGhost> thanks for hlep btw
[13:21:57] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost ... could you use one of the services mentioned by the bot?
[13:22:02] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz so it depends on where you want your perfomance hit to come from.
[13:22:04] <jeebster> shoky: thanks, this appears to work too $('*[data-number:lt(4)')
[13:22:31] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel uhh.. cant just looka t javascript lol?
[13:22:48] <duch_kazatel> most other services have terrible highlighing.
[13:23:11] <duch_kazatel> i'll poke.
[13:23:14] <DarkGhost> I'm getting typerror: undefined is not a function
[13:23:30] <shoky> jeebster uhh no that doesn't work ;p
[13:24:26] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost so you want all inputs in signupform that aren't the submit button?
[13:24:28] <shoky> jeebster: .filter(function() { return $(this).data('number') < 4 })
[13:24:31] <jhjohnson> duch_kazatel: i don't think that jsperf is clean. the find()'s are throwing off the pure comparison of delegation vs bind. plus he's calling bind after every ajax success. i wonder how the app functions after an hour.
[13:24:51] <duch_kazatel> jhjohnson the guy said that all originally.
[13:24:53] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[13:25:16] <DarkGhost> yes duch_kazatel
[13:25:27] <DarkGhost> but that parts works.. atleast when i do $('that').click
[13:26:33] <duch_kazatel> wait then what part doesn't work?
[13:26:55] <DarkGhost> idk i just get an error
[13:26:55] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: nice find
[13:27:07] <DarkGhost> undefined is not a function duch_kazatel
[13:27:09] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: yea man i wish i had the time to benchmark this stuff
[13:27:16] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost on what line?  more info would be helpful.
[13:27:26] <DarkGhost> 74
[13:27:26] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz see jhjohnson's remarks about it though.
[13:27:29] <DarkGhost> which is
[13:27:33] <DarkGhost> the .on()
[13:27:34] <DarkGhost> line
[13:27:49] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost try $("#signupbox").on('click', '#signupform input:not([type="submit"])', function(e) {
[13:27:55] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: where
[13:28:14] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz this bit - "<jhjohnson> duch_kazatel: i don't think that jsperf is clean. the find()'s are throwing off the pure comparison of delegation vs bind. plus he's calling bind after every ajax success. i wonder how the app functions after an hour."
[13:28:37] <acidjazz> is he unbinding on those functions
[13:28:43] <acidjazz> before calling those ajax binds
[13:28:45] <DarkGhost> same error same line
[13:29:10] <hesco> using jquery.validate.js library, two of the three custom jQuery.validator.addMethod I just added are firing and displaying the anticipated error messages on the client side, even so, it permitted form submission generating a 500 in the server logs.  why might that be?  what is it I would look for here?
[13:29:17] <jhjohnson> acidjazz: a quick google search would change your position on this
[13:29:42] <jhjohnson> instead of putting your head in the sand and saying you don't have time to find out that you're possibly wrong. yes what you're doing works. no it's not the most efficient.
[13:29:47] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost could you share the rendered markup and javascript via a fiddle?
[13:30:02] <acidjazz> jhjohnson: i never said i was wrong i said i do both
[13:30:39] <acidjazz> and ive found some cases where either/or work
[13:31:32] <duch_kazatel> also, that test is flawed - a user is not usually going to click every single link.
[13:31:44] <BillCriswell> I click ALL links.
[13:31:49] <BillCriswell> Don't tell me how to live my life.
[13:31:52] <duch_kazatel> in rapid succession.
[13:31:57] <BillCriswell> YEs.
[13:31:59] <duch_kazatel> good
[13:32:27] <BillCriswell> My arm flab is mesmorizing when I'm doing that.
[13:32:27] <acidjazz> lol BillCriswell
[13:32:34] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[13:32:58] <BillCriswell> Oh shit it's 4:30
[13:33:36] <BillCriswell> "website aerobics"... who's in?
[13:35:14] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell I think you helped me with this same problem before
[13:35:26] <DarkGhost> I'm using .load and then trying to do an onclick after.. but .on() isnt working
[13:35:53] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: Sounds like a scenario for event delegation.
[13:36:01] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost you're using the right version of .on(), but you never told me exactly what error you're getting.
[13:42:54] <oggy729> Noob question? I would like to store a list of auto manufacturers and their associated models. So the "Honda" key would contain "Civic", "Accord", and etc. And then, I would like to search this list (dict?) based on the manufacturer key....to list all of their models.
[13:43:31] <duch_kazatel> an object.
[13:45:07] <oggy729> so then models_dict = []   ... and then push to it with like: models_dict.push({ key: make.niceName, value: model.niceName });           ????
[13:45:10] <erming> oggy729: var obj = {"honda": ["civic", "accord"]};
[13:45:31] <erming> get it with obj.honda or obj["honda"]
[13:45:38] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 http://jsfiddle.net/Sbu97/
[13:45:41] <BillCriswell> oggy729: YEs.
[13:46:00] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 your case doesn't make sense.
[13:46:05] <duch_kazatel> *code
[13:46:46] <duch_kazatel> you're creating an array and then pushing objects into it.  you want an object with properties that are arrays - look at erming or my examples.
[13:46:59] <oggy729> i see i see....
[13:47:15] <oggy729> that example is exactly what i need
[13:47:30] <duch_kazatel> also, javascript doesn't have "dicts" or "dictionaries" or hashes/associative arrays.  it has objects.  some objects are arrays.
[13:47:34] <duch_kazatel> welcome to the insanity
[13:47:56] <oggy729> lol :D
[13:47:59] <BillCriswell> I think an array of manufacturers would make more sense?
[13:48:16] <BillCriswell> Well, an array of objects.
[13:48:23] <duch_kazatel> "I would like to search this list (dict?) based on the manufacturer key....to list all of their models."
[13:48:36] <duch_kazatel> imo the object is easier for that - your key is the manufacturer name.
[13:49:19] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah, I was over thinking something.
[13:49:36] <erming> easy to look too
[13:49:36] <duch_kazatel> ah
[13:49:44] <erming> loop*
[13:50:53] <oggy729> it certainly looks very clean. can i get one more example if you are feeling so kind? so let's say I were looping through my manufacturers..."honda" would hit for three models. what syntax would i use to create the "honda" key and add whatever is found? Like...a sample creation statement in the loop?
[13:51:23] <BillCriswell> I Was thinking in terms of like cars.honda.civic instead of like cars.honda.makes.civic I was worried about it getting messy.
[13:51:28] <erming> with objects your keys are unique.. you would only have one "honda" for example
[13:52:08] <erming> example is coming your way soon, hold on
[13:52:31] <oggy729> right....2 for loops is what i was thinking. the outer would loop through each manufacturer and create a key....then an inner loop would get all their models and make push them in
[13:53:10] <oggy729> if that makes sense? i've been pulling my hair out over this for a few hours and am starting to question my grasp on sanity and reality, so...
[13:53:49] <BillCriswell> oggy729: That's when var cars = { "Honda": { makes: [] } } ad you can do cars["Honda"].makes.push({ name: "Civic" });
[13:54:26] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 hrm?
[13:54:39] <duch_kazatel> oh sorry was scrolled up.
[13:54:57] <BillCriswell> I'm down here over complicating probably.
[13:55:04] <BillCriswell> Or not listening to things fully.
[13:55:05] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 you mean you want to add to the honda key?
[13:56:22] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 http://jsfiddle.net/Sbu97/2/
[13:56:38] <duch_kazatel> that shows how to add to an existing property, as well as add a new property.
[13:58:05] <erming> looked at my project on github, was like "wat? bug?".. they've changed the color for the javascript language indicator
[13:58:06] <erming> heh
[13:58:40] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: you are the man
[13:59:22] <oggy729> and thank you to everyone else as well
[14:00:17] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 of course.
[14:00:18] <duch_kazatel> yw
[14:00:28] <erming> :>
[14:08:31] <ikla> I'm trying to do a $(select:name[=DFG].val(16); and it doesn't work unless I put it in a $( document ).ready(function()
[14:08:36] <ikla> anyway around this
[14:08:46] <duch_kazatel> the document has to exist first.
[14:09:02] <duch_kazatel> either use a doc ready, a $(function(){});, or put your code at the end.
[14:09:06] <duch_kazatel> *end of the page.
[14:09:12] <ikla> it is at the end
[14:09:30] <duch_kazatel> does that content get added after the page loads?
[14:09:32] <duch_kazatel> via ajax?
[14:09:43] <ikla> no its pushed out by php
[14:09:55] <duch_kazatel> then something else is up,
[14:10:02] <duch_kazatel> is the document valid?
[14:10:08] <erming> why dont you want it inside document ready?
[14:10:08] <ikla> yeah
[14:10:23] <duch_kazatel> why is the doc ready a problem?
[14:10:27] <ikla> cause I need to pull data from the page and need that update or my .load doesn't work
[14:10:29] <erming> what does the javascript console say?
[14:10:32] <ikla> since it updates during the doc ready
[14:10:41] <erming> "$ is not defined" = document ready should solve this
[14:10:58] <duch_kazatel> you need to update something on the page prior to doc ready, ikla?
[14:11:10] <ikla> pretty much
[14:11:26] <ikla> basically just change the option in a <select>
[14:11:29] <duch_kazatel> that's.. not a good sign.  you need to setup everything in a doc ready and call your functions after you're done your ubject.
[14:11:32] <duch_kazatel> *update
[14:11:40] <duch_kazatel> why aren't use setting the select server-side?
[14:11:50] <NoiseEee> ikla: again you seem to be misunderstanding something as you mention 'wait for php'
[14:11:57] <NoiseEee> guess what, php is finished by the time your page begins to render
[14:12:10] <Asweb_> Good evening everyone
[14:12:12] <ikla> NoiseEee I know
[14:12:15] <NoiseEee> and why do you need to 'get around' document ready?
[14:12:17] <erming> ahoy o/
[14:12:22] <Asweb_> Does anyone here use jQuery.load to load his views/html content?
[14:12:34] <duch_kazatel> Asweb_ i've used ajax before, yes :)
[14:12:36] <ikla> duch, I need to use jquery since I'm unable to set it server-side
[14:12:43] <Asweb_> duch_kazatel: isnt slow?
[14:12:45] <duch_kazatel> ikla then you need to refactor your frontend.
[14:12:49] <duch_kazatel> Asweb_ hrm?
[14:12:58] <Asweb_> I have tested full reload of the page vs jQuery.load to load HTML
[14:13:04] <Asweb_> jQuery.load take much more time
[14:13:08] <duch_kazatel> depends on what you're doing.
[14:13:17] <duch_kazatel> and how you're doing it.
[14:13:22] <Asweb_> Its to render a view with html content + JS scripts + CSS
[14:13:28] <duch_kazatel> Asweb_ that's a bad idea.
[14:13:51] <erming> Asweb_: you want to replace <head> and so on?
[14:13:57] <Asweb_> No
[14:14:04] <Asweb_> Only a main div on my page
[14:14:08] <Asweb_> that contains the main content
[14:14:09] <duch_kazatel> Asweb_ you should persist parts of your page and only repalce the content that needs updating.
[14:14:12] <Asweb_> which is replaced everytime
[14:14:12] <duch_kazatel> don't replace everyuthing.
[14:14:18] <NoiseEee> ikla: why are you concerned about document.ready?
[14:14:21] <erming> Asweb_ ok
[14:14:21] <Asweb_> Yeah thats what im doing
[14:14:29] <duch_kazatel> Asweb_ okay.  that shouldn't be slower.
[14:15:21] <erming> Asweb_ you got some code to show us?
[14:16:09] <Asweb_> I just have like <div id="main-content"> </div> and for example, give me the list of all users, I do $('#main-content').load('/users')
[14:16:22] <Asweb_>  / users = > render html content
[14:16:30] <duch_kazatel> Asweb_ the only reason it'd be slower is because your server is slower.
[14:16:39] <duch_kazatel> define "slower"
[14:17:40] <Asweb_> My DOM is loaded in 3 seconds without AJAX call to load the content
[14:17:46] <Asweb_> and around 6-9 seconds
[14:17:49] <Asweb_> using jQuery.load
[14:17:50] <oggy729> I'm baaaack :) So in my loop, I am iterating through a list of manufacters (makes). And I assign: this_name = make.name; And then I attempt to make the key with: models_dict.this_name = [];
[14:17:53] <erming> woa, that's really slow
[14:18:04] <duch_kazatel> Asweb_ 3 seconds from what?
[14:18:09] <duch_kazatel> 6-9 seconds from what?
[14:18:22] <duch_kazatel> sounds like your server is doing a bunch of extra work.
[14:18:27] <oggy729> so it should be: models_dict.subaru   except it is coming out as models_dict.this_name
[14:18:30] <NoiseEee> Asweb_: can't you load that list of users immediately / render the page with it?
[14:18:32] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 stop calling it a dict.
[14:18:37] <oggy729> lol, sorry
[14:18:37] <erming> oggy729: use this: models_dict[this_name] = [];
[14:18:39] <oggy729> object
[14:19:11] <erming> models_dict.this_name = it tries to get ".this_name", not the variable value
[14:19:13] <Asweb_> Noise: What do you mean exactly?
[14:20:06] <duch_kazatel> Asweb_ he's asking why you think you need ajax.
[14:20:08] <oggy729> IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!
[14:20:12] <erming> horay!
[14:20:27] <Asweb_> duch: I thought AJAX would make my load content faster since it doesnt reload everything
[14:20:35] <NoiseEee> Asweb_: also, first you need to figure out where your page is really slowing down.  in the network tab, how long is the ajax resource taking?
[14:20:38] <Asweb_> looks like Im wrong
[14:20:43] <duch_kazatel> Asweb_ uh wat
[14:20:55] <duch_kazatel> Asweb_ we're suggesting you load everything up from and hide/show as appropriate.
[14:21:00] <NoiseEee> Asweb_: maybe its the way you're using JS to update the DOM thats taking so long
[14:21:06] <duch_kazatel> but it shouldn't be slower.
[14:21:25] <erming> how many users?
[14:21:26] <Asweb_> Ok thanks a lot guys
[14:21:29] <Asweb_> gonna take a look
[14:21:29] <duch_kazatel> ajax won't be inherently slower.
[14:21:33] <NoiseEee> Asweb_: or, if the call to someAjaxResource.php is really taking 5 seconds, then you have a server side issue.
[14:21:35] <erming> Asweb_: you have like 5k-10k rows? :p
[14:21:45] <Asweb_> 100+
[14:21:48] <duch_kazatel> try loading the fragment by itself in your browser and see what the load times are like.
[14:21:49] <Asweb_> haha :P
[14:21:59] <Asweb_> ok thanks a lot guys !
[14:22:05] <Asweb_> Appreciate the help x)
[14:22:33] <duch_kazatel> sure
[14:30:15] <duch_kazatel> woah did github change the colors for the language stats?
[14:30:27] <erming> yep
[14:30:30] <erming> just now
[14:30:39] <erming> m'yellow
[14:30:42] <duch_kazatel> oh :(
[14:30:53] <erming> even had two tabs open to compare, heh
[14:31:00] <duch_kazatel> we have an app that's mostly coldfusion and javascript.
[14:31:06] <duch_kazatel> the color combination is not flattering.
[14:31:12] <erming> link :D
[14:31:14] <erming> (if public)
[14:31:20] <duch_kazatel> not public.
[14:31:41] <erming> hmm, i wonder if you could make a rainbow
[14:32:03] <erming> i'll save that for when i feel like trolling with unicorn repositories
[14:32:11] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[14:32:19] <duch_kazatel> why'd they change it though
[14:32:25] <oggy729> ok, so after this next question I'm going to give up and read some jquery tutorials.
[14:32:39] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 nothing you've asked has been a jquery question.
[14:32:43] <erming> rofl
[14:32:46] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:33:04] <oggy729> jscript/jquery
[14:33:08] <duch_kazatel> *javascript
[14:33:11] <oggy729> i know neither, so....
[14:33:18] <duch_kazatel> fair enough
[14:33:30] <duch_kazatel> fyi jscript is an old microsoft implementation of ecmascript
[14:33:57] <erming> coldfusion btw.. isn't that old tech? adobe, right?
[14:34:05] <erming> well, "old" = i've not seen it before
[14:34:08] <duch_kazatel> adobe yes, "old arguably"
[14:34:12] <duch_kazatel> it's still active.
[14:34:18] <duch_kazatel> and getting updates.
[14:34:20] <duch_kazatel> cf10 was released not long ago.
[14:34:26] <erming> where you from?
[14:34:33] <duch_kazatel> california.
[14:34:37] <oggy729> I can console.log(models_dict["Honda"]) and get what I want...but I don't know the syntax to search it by a variable manufacturer
[14:35:00] <duch_kazatel> (models_dict[manufacturer]
[14:35:10] <oggy729> ...also, i am totally going to rename that to "models_OBJECT"
[14:35:19] <duch_kazatel> var manufacturer = 'Honda'; console.log(models_dict[manufacturer]);
[14:35:43] <oggy729> I mean....loop through and output everything by "Honda"
[14:35:51] <duch_kazatel> "loop through" what?
[14:35:57] <duch_kazatel> the honda array?
[14:35:58] <oggy729> ...or do some other actuion for each element that matches Honda
[14:36:02] <oggy729> action
[14:36:04] <erming> you will only have _one_ "honda"
[14:36:10] <duch_kazatel> you can only have one honda.
[14:36:11] <oggy729> All it's children
[14:36:27] <duch_kazatel> like you would an any other array - a for loop.
[14:36:57] <erming> oggy729: try this
[14:37:01] <duch_kazatel> for (var i = 0; i < models_dict.honda; i++) {models_dict.honda[i]};
[14:37:07] <erming> for (var m in models_dict) { console.log(m); }
[14:37:15] <erming> should echo all the keys on your dictionary
[14:37:16] <oggy729> OH!
[14:37:40] <erming> these are two ways to iterate :> think of mine like a foreach
[14:37:54] <duch_kazatel> erming that one is for normal objects.
[14:38:31] <erming> oh, i missed the part where he wanted to loop the array
[14:38:35] <erming> but
[14:38:40] <erming> you've missed .length
[14:38:46] <duch_kazatel> woops you're right.
[14:39:36] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Sbu97/3/
[14:39:48] <duch_kazatel> for the unnecessarily optimized version.
[14:40:42] <erming> duch, what's your username on github?
[14:40:51] <duch_kazatel> my real name ;)
[14:40:59] <duch_kazatel> something i haven't revealed in here.
[14:41:30] <erming> well, your first name is probably Robert
[14:41:31] <erming> :>
[14:41:48] <duch_kazatel> sure is.  and i'm in california.  good luck with the rest :)
[14:43:34] <duch_kazatel> and this username has only been used in like three places total, only 2 of those indexed by google.
[14:45:06] <synfin> Simple scoping question here.  http://pastebin.com/9cK9a5UE , shouldn't table_original within 'var record_change' be a reference to table_original defined earlier in the program thanks to closure?  When I run it record_change says table_original[x][y] is undefined, when I debug the for loop above it, it is defined.
[14:46:06] <oggy729> for (var i = 0; i < models_dict.honda; i++)     models_dict.honda simply returns a list of the models...the for loop is never firing, because 0 evaluates to less than that?
[14:46:30] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 i had that wrong - for (var i = 0; i < models_dict.honda.length; i++)
[14:46:30] <oggy729>  models_dict.honda.length?
[14:46:39] <oggy729> awesome possum
[14:47:39] <oggy729> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined    ARRGH
[14:47:43] <oggy729> I give up
[14:47:47] <oggy729> lol
[14:47:57] <duch_kazatel> models_dict['Honda'] maybe?
[14:48:22] <duch_kazatel> synfin table_original should exist everywhere, yes.
[14:48:40] <duch_kazatel> but that error could mean table_original[x] is undefined, too.
[14:49:25] <oggy729> for (var i = 0; i < models_dict[make].length; i++) {
[14:49:25] <oggy729> 			alert(models_dict[make]);
[14:49:26] <oggy729> 		}
[14:49:37] <oggy729> works like a champ
[14:49:57] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:50:00] <vmassuchetto> Any idea why I can't display a hidden element using fadeIn()?

[14:50:11] <vmassuchetto> I'm sure I'm selecting it right.
[14:50:41] <erming> duch_kazatel, well, i tried my best.. Robert Klaas, Robert Biggs.. close?
[14:50:45] <vmassuchetto> blindMoe, well, I can try reproducing all my environment there
[14:51:17] <oggy729> Except I should have written: alert(models_dict[make][i]);
[14:56:12] <duch_kazatel> back
[14:56:16] <duch_kazatel> and erming nope.
[14:56:35] <synfin> duch_kazatel: I found the error.  I was using the variable 'r' when I should have used the variable 'num' in record_change.
[14:56:53] <duch_kazatel> synfin :)
[14:56:55] <duch_kazatel> perfect.
[14:57:04] <erming> lurking linkedin for california developers with jquery and coldfusion knowledge.. oh well!
[14:57:09] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 use the console instead btw.
[14:58:20] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: is there an advantage to that besides the annoyance of an alert?
[14:58:29] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't stop execution of your code.
[14:58:37] <duch_kazatel> makes it easier to troubleshoot.
[14:58:38] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: nice...thank you
[14:58:41] <duch_kazatel> gets you in the console.
[14:58:42] <erming> oggy729: and you can browse objects
[14:58:44] <erming> which is really nice
[14:58:50] <erming> like a debugger
[14:59:22] <duch_kazatel> there's also a debugger built-in to most web inspectors, too.
[14:59:26] <erming> try this in your console: console.log({foo: {bar: 1}});
[14:59:28] <erming> for example
[14:59:59] <erming> if you're using chrome, or even firefox and IE i think, you can click the output and browse it
[15:00:04] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[15:00:06] <duch_kazatel> they all support it.
[15:00:14] <oggy729> so in....4 hours...i learned how to call an API, how to parse the results, how to create a javascript (not jscript) object (NOT DICT), what console.log is (and why it is better than alert)
[15:00:17] <duch_kazatel> firebug/firefox's native tools do it now.
[15:00:25] <oggy729> my brain is full
[15:00:28] <duch_kazatel> and IE11's dev tools are awesome.
[15:00:35] <duch_kazatel> what sort of API call, erming?
[15:00:37] <oggy729> thank you guys so much for helping me get that working
[15:00:49] <erming> damn.. woke up 14 hours ago, been at my computer for 13 hours
[15:01:33] <erming> duch, what api?
[15:01:41] <erming> the thing i mentioned about lurking on linkedin?
[15:01:46] <oggy729> i've been using chrome for years....just discovered recently that f12 brought up the console. lol
[15:01:50] <duch_kazatel> err, i meant oggy729
[15:01:56] <EminenceHC> Is it possible to hide all empty columns of a table even if the column headers have a colspan of 2?
[15:02:06] <erming> oggy729: try shift+ctrl+c
[15:02:09] <erming> and click any object
[15:02:33] <erming> i use that shortcut alot
[15:02:50] <erming> it's a shortcut for the 'Inspect element', kinda
[15:02:59] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: it's a free API from edmunds....basically, i pass it a year and it returns all the manufacturers that made cars that year. then i pass it a manufacturer, and it gives me all models for that year/manufacturer. then i pass it a model and it gives me all trim levels for that model
[15:03:12] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 aaah that's good practice.
[15:04:36] <oggy729> yup...i actually have no use for it, just trying to learn a bit
[15:04:54] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest checking out MDN - that's a great resource.
[15:05:38] <oggy729> awesome, will do
[15:10:26] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel sorry for delay http://jsfiddle.net/Bj5Jr/1/
[15:10:59] <duch_kazatel> ever accidentally hosed production? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL_g0tyaIeE
[15:11:50] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost huh?  oooh this one - waht about the html that gets ajax'd in?
[15:11:57] <DarkGhost> where should i add it
[15:12:08] <duch_kazatel> wherever it would be live.
[15:12:14] <duch_kazatel> in the html panel.
[15:12:25] <DarkGhost> http://jsfiddle.net/Bj5Jr/2/
[15:12:29] <erming> would like to see steve jobs reaction to that disaster
[15:13:04] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost okay, so you want every form element but the submit button - why?
[15:13:59] <duch_kazatel> because this works in the fiddle.
[15:14:18] <DarkGhost> it works in fiddle?
[15:14:25] <duch_kazatel> look at your console.
[15:14:28] <duch_kazatel> it's working.
[15:14:49] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel because the idea behind it is once you click on an input form it          $("#" + $(this).attr('name')).css("display", "block");
[15:14:55] <duch_kazatel> the only think i could think of as far as the undefined error is that $("#" + $(this).attr('name')) isn't what you think it is.
[15:14:56] <DarkGhost> shows the the black thing thats hidden
[15:15:11] <vmassuchetto> blindMoe, I couldn't reproduce the problem in jsfiddle, and still have no idea why I can't show an element using any method
[15:15:14] <DarkGhost> hmm it does work.. thats weird.
[15:15:21] <DarkGhost> why doesnt it work on site then/
[15:15:43] <vmassuchetto> blindMoe, tried .css('display', 'block') .show() .fadeIn() .slideDown() ...
[15:16:10] <blindMoe> vmassuchetto: the point of quickly reproducing the problem in jsfiddle is so that we can see it and help you
[15:16:23] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost because $("#signupbox") or $("#" + $(this).attr('name')) aren't what you think they are.
[15:16:30] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatewhat are thy lol
[15:16:31] <blindMoe> brb
[15:16:45] <tase> does an async (s)ajax get block the function ?  $.ajax({ async : false, success : function(html) {..}}) ?
[15:17:07] <duch_kazatel> "get block the fuction" huh tase?
[15:17:14] <tase> the function in which it is called in
[15:17:17] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost i'd console.log each of them.
[15:17:34] <DarkGhost> but duch_kazatel  even if i // comment out all of that I still get an error
[15:17:48] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost... then you need to correct that error.
[15:17:56] <tase> err i mean does it block the function processing while it's being called
[15:17:57] <duch_kazatel> tase still not making sense.  that success handler will only run on success.
[15:17:59] <DarkGhost> undefined Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[15:18:06] <shoky> tase async:false can block, yes. you shouldn't use it hardly ever
[15:18:17] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost that is one of the most generic errors ever,  i'd need to see more to know.
[15:18:34] <DarkGhost> you're seein it all.. I put it in the jsfiddle
[15:18:49] <oggy729> jQuery.getJSON(postURL, function(data) {    <-- I don't fully understand the function(data) portion....should I just read this as "get data from getJSON and pass it to this generically named function?
[15:19:00] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost could you screenshot your entire console window and share that with the room please?
[15:19:05] <duch_kazatel> there should be more info than that.
[15:19:26] <vmassuchetto> blindMoe, I see, thanks for that anyway
[15:19:41] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 basically.  that arg is what you're calling the data.
[15:19:43] <shoky> oggy729: you're passing an anonymous function as an argument to getJSON. getJSON will call this function (callback) when the data arrives
[15:19:52] <duch_kazatel> shoky ++
[15:19:56] <DarkGhost> http://cl.ly/image/0O1i2I3V0q1T/Image%202014-04-23%20at%206.19.21%20pm.png duch_kazatel
[15:20:03] <vmassuchetto> blindMoe, still, any ideas why this is happening? must be some sort of external interference
[15:20:04] <tase> shoky im making a function that does a GET, i need it to be async some times, and other times I need the function that does the GET to return something. I can't return anything if it's async
[15:20:24] <oggy729> it seems like it would be so much cleaner to say jQuery.getJSON(postURL, parseResults(data));
[15:20:28] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost your js is in a separate js file, right?
[15:20:39] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 not in that case.
[15:20:51] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 you have to specify what that second arg is.
[15:20:58] <shoky> tase you need to get used to working with callbacks for async stuff. your function can return the $.ajax call itself, and then you call .done(function..) on that
[15:21:12] <oggy729> right...i would just define parseResults like any other function
[15:21:12] <duch_kazatel> you could do jQuery.getJSON(postURL, parseResults); and define parseResults elsewhere.
[15:21:16] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[15:21:31] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel no
[15:21:35] <DarkGhost> in bottom of html file
[15:21:39] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost fix that first then.
[15:21:51] <duch_kazatel> because it's going to be a PITA trying to troubleshoot otherwise.
[15:21:56] <tase> shoky that would just be wrapping an ajax call with a url
[15:22:12] <shoky> tase: like..  function doAjax() { return $.get('url') }    var ajaxReq = doAjax();    ... ajaxReq.done(function(data) { ... })
[15:22:31] <shoky> tase wrapping an ajax call with a url? huh
[15:22:41] <tase> ye  doAjax() { return $.get('url') }
[15:22:47] <tase> it's an ajax call with a url
[15:22:54] <shoky> ah. ok.. so yeah ;p
[15:23:16] <shoky> but the main point is that there is that function(data) { .. } callback
[15:23:35] <shoky> and that you can call .done  as many times as you want
[15:24:04] <tase> well the only difference when it's async and sync is that the async prints and the sync returns
[15:24:21] <tase> so idd have to duplicate the data processing
[15:24:22] <shoky> huh..
[15:24:51] <tase> ajax () function (data) { do stuff with data, print result }        ajax () function (data) { do stuff with data, return result }
[15:25:38] <shoky> async returns a promise/deferred that you can call .done on to get the data.  sync blocks and just returns the data.. yes
[15:26:01] <shoky> donno what you mean by "print result" tho
[15:26:06] <tase> console.log
[15:26:13] <shoky> what does that have to do with anything..
[15:26:19] <tase> thats the print
[15:26:30] <shoky> what does it have to do with async vs sync..
[15:26:40] <blindMoe> vmassuchetto: w/o seeing any code I can't help
[15:26:55] <tase> dont need to have it synchronous when i just want to console.log the result and discard it afterwards
[15:27:20] <shoky> synchronous is bad
[15:27:23] <shoky> async is good
[15:27:32] <shoky> donno what console.log has to do with it, you can do it either way
[15:27:51] <DarkGhost> ok now what duch_kazatel
[15:28:05] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost that error should be much more descriptive now.
[15:28:12] <duch_kazatel> what line does it give you in your js?
[15:29:06] <tase> idd need to callback on my own function and not ajax
[15:29:22] <shoky> wat
[15:29:36] <duch_kazatel> has tase shared any code at this point?
[15:30:09] <shoky> just this  $.ajax({ async : false, success : function(html) {..}})
[15:30:18] <tase> myfunction () { $.ajax({...})  trigger("done"); }
[15:30:19] <duch_kazatel> yeah i want to see waht they're doing.
[15:30:23] <duch_kazatel> like, all of it in a fiddle.
[15:30:31] <DarkGhost> line 22 duch_kazatel and same error
[15:30:42] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost okay, and what's on line 22?
[15:30:54] <DarkGhost> same thing
[15:30:55] <DarkGhost> the .on
[15:30:56] <shoky> tase:  function doAjax() { return $.get('url') }    var ajaxReq = doAjax();    ... ajaxReq.done(function(data) { console.log(data) })
[15:31:17] <DarkGhost> $("#signupbox").on('click', '#signupform input:not([type="submit"])', function() {
[15:31:41] <tase> its not a 1-to-1 log of the data, the processing is the same when i want to return(processedData) and console.log(processedData)
[15:32:04] <shoky> how is it not a 1-to-1 log of the data
[15:32:11] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost are you getting the console.log to fire?
[15:32:29] <DarkGhost> no duch_kazatel
[15:32:35] <DarkGhost> :(
[15:32:43] <duch_kazatel> you're not like, double-including your js or anything, right?
[15:32:46] <duch_kazatel> because this is really bizarre.
[15:33:03] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you on locally?
[15:33:18] <DarkGhost> 1.6.1
[15:33:23] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[15:33:25] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[15:33:30] <duch_kazatel> update that
[15:34:11] <DarkGhost> uhp lol works
[15:34:14] <DarkGhost> wonder why it was so outdated
[15:34:23] <duch_kazatel> that's WAY outdated, too.
[15:35:18] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel so do I need to do a .on for everything i want ot call on those
[15:35:20] <DarkGhost> like focus and stuf
[15:36:13] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost i'd use .on() since focus and the others usually just call .on()
[15:37:09] <DarkGhost> and blur?
[15:37:12] <DarkGhost> all of those have t be .on :(
[15:37:18] <duch_kazatel> they don't have to be.
[15:37:19] <duch_kazatel> but they all call on.
[15:37:20] <DarkGhost> isnt there anyway I can just do .on once and all the other ones will work
[15:37:25] <duch_kazatel> under the hood.
[15:37:28] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:37:45] <DarkGhost> the reason I'm doing .on isbecause its loading via ajax and byou know the rest right?
[15:37:47] <duch_kazatel> .blur(function(){}) is the same as .on('blur', function(){});
[15:37:54] <tase> can I trigger my own event ? i.e  myfunction() { trigger("done", data); }    something() {  myfunction().done(function(data) {});  }   ?
[15:37:59] <duch_kazatel> ah you mean for delegation.
[15:38:04] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel yeah
[15:38:14] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost yeah, .on() is how you run delegation.
[15:38:40] <DarkGhost> no way I can just do a delegation once and get it to work for rest?
[15:39:05] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost huh?  you should only need to hook in one handler for each event.
[15:39:17] <duch_kazatel> one .on('click', one .on('blur', etc.
[15:39:21] <DarkGhost> yeah
[15:39:29] <duch_kazatel> you could also bind to multiple events, but that gets a little hairly.
[15:39:29] <DarkGhost> but i want just the .blur() to work
[15:39:30] <DarkGhost> lol
[15:39:33] <duch_kazatel> *hairy
[15:39:42] <duch_kazatel> then .on('blur', 'child', function(){});
[15:40:41] <duch_kazatel> and then all your logic for that particular blur.
[15:42:06] <DarkGhost> yeah ok ty
[15:45:24] <tase> shoky, i got the solution, just needed to make my own callback, so i could do the async call, process the data, and use the callback method if i needed the data further
[16:01:33] <pnj> can someone suggest a simple game or something I could build w/ jquery so that I can try to learn some coding?
[16:02:09] <duch_kazatel> pnj build a weather widget.
[16:02:19] <duch_kazatel> pnj how familiar are you with html and css?
[16:03:12] <pnj> pretty familiar duch_kazatel
[16:03:23] <pnj> hold on. i'll show you what I just did...
[16:03:38] <duch_kazatel> okay
[16:03:49] <pnj> http://local4130.org/jquery/tic-tac-toe.html
[16:04:02] <duch_kazatel> okay
[16:04:11] <pnj> it's not perfect but I need to take a break from it..
[16:04:18] <pnj> and work on something else.
[16:04:28] <duch_kazatel> then build a weather widget - learn how to access an API and use the returned data.
[16:04:57] <pnj> hmmm. not really sure what you mean. i know what api is.. :)
[16:05:14] <duch_kazatel> build out something that displays weather for a given area.
[16:05:20] <duch_kazatel> maybe use the zip code they enter, etc.
[16:05:41] <pnj> the data for the weather is hosted somewhere else?
[16:05:46] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:06:01] <duch_kazatel> wunderground has a public api last i checked.  that should work if you're stateside.
[16:06:21] <pnj> it's the first google item returned. :)
[16:07:24] <chovy> $.when(foo, bar).then(function(foo, bar){}); <-- is this correct?
[16:10:27] <pnj> duch_kazatel: this wunderground thing looks a bit complex.
[16:10:34] <pnj> I'm not even sure what i'm looking at... :/
[16:10:37] <duch_kazatel> pnj lol
[16:10:40] <duch_kazatel> pnj fair enough.
[16:10:50] <pnj> got a simpler suggestion? :)
[16:11:11] <duch_kazatel> find an api and learn how to use it i guess.
[16:38:54] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah 49 second sass compile time
[16:41:42] <AndroidLoverInSF> is there any query plugin that lets me have a select list but lets the user type in a text fragment and it "moves" to the 1st item in that list that starts with those typed chars?
[16:48:22] <obert> hello, how to .append() an html element inside another one after clicked on a html element, please?
[16:48:22] <duch_kazatel> wut
[16:48:22] <duch_kazatel> bind using .on('click', function(){});
[16:48:23] <TViernion> evening guys...
[16:48:23] <duch_kazatel> hello.
[16:48:23] <TViernion> Any pointers as to where to log to reload a div AND run php while doing it?
[16:48:23] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:48:24] <obert> duch_kazatel: i need to create an element and replace it, at the moment it does not replace the generated element when you click again
[16:48:24] <obert> http://pastebin.com/e8YWy3cQ
[16:48:26] <duch_kazatel> obert could you create a functioning example on jsfiddle instead?
[16:48:46] <TViernion> I have a page that displays variables that are created by an include.  I need to refresh a single div but call that php at the same time so the variables are updated.
[16:48:56] <duch_kazatel> TViernion you want ajax then.
[16:49:02] <TViernion> ah...
[16:49:03] <duch_kazatel> TViernion otherwise you can't "run php"
[16:49:05] <TViernion> thanks dutch.
[16:49:07] <duch_kazatel> *duch
[16:49:13] * TViernion goes to ajax 
[16:49:17] <TViernion> s/dutch/duch
[16:49:22] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery ajax
[16:49:23] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: jQuery.ajax() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:50:00] <obert> it is a gallery, so i would to create <figure id="photo"> after clicked on a thumbnail, then open the other thumbs in that <figure id="photo">.now it is just adding every new big photos in <figure id="photo"> instead replace it when click on other thumbs
[16:50:03] <duch_kazatel> basically, setup a new "page" that you can hit for that specific content and load it using ajax.
[16:50:20] <duch_kazatel> obert huh?  figure isn't a valid tag.
[16:50:34] <obert> duch_kazatel: html5
[16:50:46] <TViernion> oh.. so i'd also have to pull out the display then for div i want to refresh
[16:50:54] <duch_kazatel> obert huh. interesting.
[16:51:05] <obert> duch_kazatel: it could be <foo> :P
[16:51:18] <obert> duch_kazatel: it is a logic problem i think
[16:51:20] <duch_kazatel> obert either way, you want to append to something?
[16:51:45] <obert> duch_kazatel:  i would to replace the content of #photo
[16:52:06] <duch_kazatel> then use .replaceWith()
[16:52:14] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery replacewith
[16:52:16] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .replaceWith() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[16:52:30] <obert> duch_kazatel: you click on a thumb: it creates <figure id="photo"> and add <img> inside. you click on another thumb, it will open its big <img> by replacing the #photo content...
[16:52:58] <obert> uff
[16:53:06] <duch_kazatel> obert sure - $('#photo').html('<img/>');
[16:53:11] <duch_kazatel> there's one way.
[16:53:12] <obert> where that comes from?
[16:53:18] <duch_kazatel> where did what come from?
[16:53:18] <obert> yeah html
[16:53:37] <obert> replaceWith()
[16:53:54] <duch_kazatel> so $('thing').on('click', function(){ $('#photo').html('<img src="aBear.jpg" />') });
[16:54:08] <duch_kazatel> replaceWith() is a jquery method. not sure if that's what you want though.
[16:54:29] <obert> no duch_kazatel sorry, i got that .html at line 9
[16:54:52] <obert> i am talking about line 4
[16:55:02] <duch_kazatel> you want to prepend content?
[16:55:09] <obert> no
[16:55:14] <obert> viceversa :)
[16:55:14] <duch_kazatel> i'm very lost.
[16:55:21] <duch_kazatel> you want to append()?
[16:55:28] <duch_kazatel> you can also do prependTo()
[16:55:35] <duch_kazatel> or appendTo()
[16:55:46] <obert> $('#content article').prepend('<figure id="photo"></figure>'); == i want to create an empty <figure id="photo"></figure> inside <content><article>
[16:56:24] <duch_kazatel> then use .append()
[16:56:45] <obert> duch_kazatel: yeah, but atm when i click on a thumb it is in loop
[16:56:52] <rogi2> I have fadeOut('fast').promise().done(…set some html()…) is there a way to abort that promise mid fade?
[16:56:52] <duch_kazatel> $('#content article').append('<figure id="photo"/>');
[16:57:23] <obert> i want to create an empty <figure id="photo"></figure> inside <content><article> one time. then replace the img src only onclick
[16:57:48] <obert> hmf
[16:58:24] <duch_kazatel> then run the append before you bind your handler. then do $('#photo img').attr('src', 'newImgSrc');
[16:59:46] <duch_kazatel> obert please don't PM me.
[17:02:22] <duch_kazatel> if you have a sample you can share with me in a pm, you can share it here.  if not, then make a test case.  if neither of those are acceptable, you're going to keep getitng simplistic answers.
[17:07:59] <oggy729> Is $(document).ready(function(){}); just a longer way of saying $(function(){}); ?
[17:08:04] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[17:08:32] <rogi2> any hints for my q?
[17:08:41] <oggy729> Why does it seem the mission of Jquery is to make the ugliest code possible?
[17:09:14] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 the mission of jquery is to abstract out the dom for you.  it's sometimes much prettier than the vanilla method.
[17:09:20] <duch_kazatel> other times it can be uglier.
[17:10:12] <duch_kazatel> rogi2 maybe use the step function?  not sure
[17:12:06] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: Actually, I have one more for you...going back to our previous example of auto manufacturers and models and etc. for (var i = 0; i < models_dict[make].length; i++)  <-- isn't there a Jquery way to do this? each or somesuch?
[17:12:28] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 you can use .each(), but it's slow and entirely unnecessary for this case.
[17:12:51] <oggy729>  models_dict[make].each()
[17:12:55] <duch_kazatel> .each() is great when you want to enumerate over, say, a jquery collection of nodes and run jquery magic against them.
[17:13:07] <learning> can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong ??
[17:13:09] <learning> http://jsfiddle.net/RL8Sp/
[17:13:36] <duch_kazatel> learning i'm getting a 400 on that URL.
[17:14:03] <oggy729> "jquery magic". as someone that is new to javascript and jquery, can you give me a real world example of something that jquery does that you think....woah, that's magic.
[17:14:09] <learning> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/RL8Sp/1/
[17:14:41] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 $('#nav').on('click', 'a', function(){}); is a good example.
[17:14:52] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily magic, but a far sight better than the alternative imo.
[17:15:10] <duch_kazatel> learning you changed nothing...
[17:15:19] <learning> :/
[17:15:20] <duch_kazatel> learning also you don't have jquery included there.
[17:15:34] <duch_kazatel> learning what browser are you using?
[17:15:42] <oggy729> so any a tag within #nav is bound to this "generic function callback whatever"
[17:15:46] <learning> duch_kazatel: google
[17:15:52] <learning> chrome
[17:15:58] <duch_kazatel> learning okay. on windows?
[17:16:02] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 nope :)
[17:16:03] <learning> hell no
[17:16:08] <learning> linux
[17:16:14] <duch_kazatel> learning okay - open up the dev tools.
[17:16:21] <learning> yeah checking
[17:16:23] <duch_kazatel> also: lol "hell no"
[17:16:30] <duch_kazatel> learning and look at your console
[17:16:30] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: lol
[17:16:41] <learning> ypeError: data.query.results.item is undefined
[17:16:41] <learning> curr_photo = data.query.results.item[i];
[17:16:44] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 that binds a delegated listener on #nav
[17:17:13] <duch_kazatel> learning I'm seeing a 400 for https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=?DATAHERE
[17:17:32] <learning> yeah cause it's api key bound
[17:17:39] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: isn't that what i said though?
[17:17:47] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 nope.
[17:17:58] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: ???
[17:18:05] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 the a tags aren't bound to anything.
[17:18:10] <duch_kazatel> there's a single listener bound to #nav
[17:18:40] <duch_kazatel> learning okay, what about data.query.results?  is that defined?
[17:19:11] <duch_kazatel> learning it's hard to help when i can't see the data.
[17:19:12] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: .on('click', 'a',   <--- on click. so the click event of #nav is bound to this function? but what about the 'a'?
[17:19:42] <learning> duch_kazatel: yeah but.. as u might have guessed SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[17:19:47] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 you're thinking backwards - a listener is bound to #nav for every click.
[17:20:09] <duch_kazatel> *every click whose selector matches a
[17:20:16] <duch_kazatel> because of event bubbling.
[17:21:29] <oggy729> "a" being...what? not <a> tags?
[17:21:35] <duch_kazatel> yes a tags.
[17:21:38] <duch_kazatel> that's a selector there.
[17:21:39] <learning> duch_kazatel: https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20flickr.groups.pools.photos%280%2C5%29%20WHERE%20group_id%3D%2722637658%40N00%27%20and%20api_key%3D%2715109112c4c2de487c59c7496d4b5ad8%27&format=json&diagnostics=true&callback=
[17:21:43] <learning> data
[17:22:25] <duch_kazatel> well, actually, the listener listens to every click inside of nav, and then calls the handler when the selector of the originating element for that click matches the 'a' selector.
[17:22:30] <duch_kazatel> which would be for <a> tags
[17:22:47] <duch_kazatel> learning okay - adding that to the fiddle.  let's poke.
[17:23:16] <oggy729> so i mean...i don't get how that differs from what i said. i feel like i'm missing something with the "thinking backwards" bit, but i don't know what
[17:23:37] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 you're talking about binding elements to javascript, which it's the other way around.
[17:24:30] <duch_kazatel> learning data.query.results.item doesn't exist.
[17:25:01] <learning> yeah
[17:25:05] <learning> it's res the photo
[17:25:07] <learning> not item
[17:25:24] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: i mean...it's binding an element to a function? how is that the other way around?
[17:25:24] <duch_kazatel> but data.query.results.photo does.  also, you're assuming there will always be at least 5 in that array
[17:25:37] <duch_kazatel> oggy729 you're binding a listener to an element.
[17:25:54] <duch_kazatel> you're not binding html to javascript.
[17:25:58] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: right...the anonymous function
[17:26:22] <duch_kazatel> right.  it's not correct to say "binding an element to a function"
[17:26:36] <duch_kazatel> you're binding a listener (that calls a function) to an element.
[17:26:59] <oggy729> duch_kazatel: or all children of an element that happen to be <a> in this case?
[17:27:04] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:27:11] <duch_kazatel> that binds a single listener in that case.
[17:27:13] <oggy729> what???????????
[17:27:19] <duch_kazatel> event bubbling :)
[17:27:34] <duch_kazatel> every time you click something in the document, the event "bubbles up" to the root.
[17:27:42] <oggy729> if it lives in #nav....and it is an <a>....this anon function is waiting to respond to its click event
[17:28:02] <oggy729> ok
[17:28:06] <duch_kazatel> the listener is waiting to fire the callback.
[17:28:39] <oggy729> i mean....i feel like i get what you're saying, but not saying it in an acceptable way
[17:28:51] <oggy729> *but i'm not saying it in an...
[17:29:02] <duch_kazatel> you're entering a world where there's a particular vernacular that's important.
[17:29:24] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise you'll get very strange looks and generate a lot of confusion.
[17:31:37] <wb_twerp> when i do elem.remove() it shows [native code]
[17:31:48] <duch_kazatel> wb_twerp wut
[17:31:53] <duch_kazatel> where does it show that?
[17:32:02] <wb_twerp> not sure what this is .. it happens only when I use angularjs alongside
[17:32:22] <wb_twerp> duch_kazatel: in the debugger
[17:32:51] <duch_kazatel> wb_twerp you sure you have jquery loaded?
[17:33:46] <wb_twerp> yep. but how does that matter.. whatever lib .remove() shouldn't be native
[17:34:25] <duch_kazatel> that sounds like something that occurs when you don't have jquery loaded and you're using the $ alias in chrome's dev tools.
[17:34:36] <duch_kazatel> what happens if you use the full jQuery() name instead of $()?
[17:35:19] <wb_twerp> i see
[17:35:22] <wb_twerp> let me try
[17:36:40] <wb_twerp> duch_kazatel: still same. how do I know jquery is loaded.. it is the first line in head
[17:37:04] <duch_kazatel> if calling jQuery() doesn't result in an error, that's likely not your problem.
[17:37:23] <wb_twerp> hmm
[17:37:41] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12286072/what-does-native-code-mean-in-webkits-inspector
[17:37:43] <duch_kazatel> that explains it.
[17:40:38] <wb_twerp> duch_kazatel: but why is remove() native ? shouldn't it map ot jquery call ?
[17:40:57] <duch_kazatel> is elem a jquery object?
[17:41:48] <wb_twerp> when i use only jquery it works as expected. yeah it has jquery cache id
[17:42:13] <wb_twerp> how do I test if it is a jquery object.. i simply queried $(...)
[17:42:17] <duch_kazatel> "it has jquery cache id" - huh?  you mean you do something like elem = $('#aThing');
[17:42:24] <wb_twerp> yeah
[17:42:38] <duch_kazatel> okay.  and you said it works normally when you don't have angular included?
[17:42:44] <wb_twerp> yep
[17:43:52] <duch_kazatel> no clue then.  is the code functioning as expected?
[17:44:06] <duch_kazatel> and are you including jquery before angular?
[17:44:19] <wb_twerp> i tried both.. before n after
[17:44:26] <duch_kazatel> should be before.
[17:45:09] <zizzl> Hey guys I'm trying to do some stuff with this "template" http://jsfiddle.net/22exm/  and I'm using this http://jsfiddle.net/EBKt8/ but the difference is on my site the opacity doesn't change until the scrolling stops, the other one it actually changes during scroll.. Can anyone see what my issue is without being able to see the live site?
[17:45:45] <duch_kazatel> zizzl holy christ that's a lot of work to do inside a scroll event
[17:46:23] <zizzl> crap is it? trying to do something like this http://couleecreative.com/ where the text changes during scroll
[17:46:39] <wb_twerp> duch_kazatel: interesting.. if i type the expression $(...).remove in watch.. it points to appropriate code
[17:46:42] <wb_twerp> in jquery
[17:46:52] <duch_kazatel> wb_twerp in what?
[17:46:57] <wb_twerp> not sure what is going on or mapped to by angularjs
[17:47:06] <zizzl> duch_kazatel ^
[17:47:13] <xniz> bleeeh :P how are you all today?
[17:47:14] <duch_kazatel> wb_twerp you are aware angular includes a limited subset of jquery, right?
[17:47:25] <duch_kazatel> zizzl right - the first one should be fine for that...
[17:47:28] <wb_twerp> yeah.. that is why I included the entire set
[17:47:37] <wb_twerp> *entire jquery
[17:47:47] <duch_kazatel> wb_twerp okay.
[17:48:04] <xniz> hey which browser does android use?
[17:48:12] <duch_kazatel> depends on the phone
[17:48:13] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, yeah but I'm doing the same thing just a couple more things.. Can you see why mine doesn't apply live and has to wait until the scroll is over?
[17:48:34] <duch_kazatel> zizzl the second one?
[17:50:04] <duch_kazatel> zizzl the second one is doing wayyy too much calculation on scroll.
[17:50:15] <duch_kazatel> xniz most are using chrome these days
[17:50:16] <duch_kazatel> iirc.
[17:51:12] <xniz> hmm it seems like its going to be hell optimizing for mobile devices
[17:51:22] <duch_kazatel> why is that?
[17:51:34] <wb_twerp> duch_kazatel: ok. here is the problem $(...)[0].remove is native
[17:51:41] <wb_twerp> $(....).remove isn't
[17:51:43] <duch_kazatel> wb_twerp right.
[17:51:52] <duch_kazatel> because $(...)[0] returns a native dom element.
[17:51:57] <wb_twerp> missed that point
[17:51:59] <wb_twerp> i see
[17:52:08] <wb_twerp> duch_kazatel: thanks
[17:52:10] <duch_kazatel> meout: 252 seconds)
[17:52:10] <duch_kazatel> [2014:04:23:17:50:41] * jamto11_ (~jamto11@cpe-66-65-28-9.nyc.res.rr.co.eq(0)
[17:52:11] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[17:52:22] <duch_kazatel> $(...).eq(0), however.
[17:52:26] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, what would you recommend to do a few elements like that?
[17:52:37] <duch_kazatel> zizzl why isn't the first example acceptable?
[17:52:58] <zizzl> duch_kazatel because that is fine for just the opacity but I'm trying to do a couple more things
[17:53:06] <duch_kazatel> zizzl like that?
[17:53:26] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, if I'm doing it wrong can you help?
[17:53:32] <duch_kazatel> zizzl huh?
[17:53:55] <zizzl> oh did you mean "like what?"
[17:53:58] <duch_kazatel> yeah sorry
[17:54:05] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  well my webpage is great on Firefox on my Android device.. but .. not so much on my androids default browser
[17:54:06] <oggy729> zizzl: just explain what else you want to do
[17:54:07] <zizzl> I thought you were being sarcastic like, but you're doing it like that?
[17:54:22] <duch_kazatel> the problem is you're running things inside an event that can fire hundred times a second basically.
[17:54:29] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, trying to decrease some margins gradually at the same time
[17:54:41] <zizzl> ok I'll minize it
[17:54:44] <zizzl> minimize it
[18:00:29] <zizzl> duch_kazatel I put the simple code on my site and it still does it after scroll
[18:00:36] <zizzl> is it because i'm loading in the footer?
[18:01:38] <duch_kazatel> zizzl "i'm loading in the footer" wat?
[18:01:48] <zizzl> the javascript
[18:01:50] <duch_kazatel> are you bouncing events or anything?
[18:02:12] <zizzl> nope, well not that i know of
[18:02:33] <duch_kazatel> are you binding inside of a document ready?
[18:02:47] <zizzl> nope
[18:02:53] <duch_kazatel> okay - start there.
[18:02:56] <zizzl> ok
[18:04:32] <zizzl> still happening
[18:04:43] <duch_kazatel> then i dunno.  i'd have to see it all in action.
[18:08:31] <oggy729> zizzl: you should probably start with posting a fiddle that includes all required definitions and behaves as you are describing.
[18:09:03] <oggy729> zizzl: rather than a piece of code that works as expected and a small piece of something that does not.
[18:17:35] <innociv_> How do I combine .dialog() with .position() in jquery ui?
[18:17:44] <innociv_> If I position the element it moves it outside of the box.
[18:19:21] <ir7466> Is anyone familiar with this project? https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete
[18:19:47] <innociv_> ah .dialog('widget')
[18:20:12] <ir7466> Basically I'm trying to find out whether it's possible to call the serviceUrl each time a key is pressed
[18:20:34] <ir7466> but to be honest I'm quite new to jquery, i wouldn't know what to be looking for in the actual code
[18:45:40] <ir7466> Is anyone familiar with this project? https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete - I was wondering if I could have some help figuring out how a piece of code in that works
[18:54:13] <gordian> ir7466: feel free to wonder
[19:00:42] <ir7466> gordion: wouldn't even know where to start asking the question
[19:01:12] <ir7466> https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete/blob/master/dist/jquery.autocomplete.js#L471
[19:01:26] <ir7466> what would cause that to get triggered?
[19:01:49] <ir7466> It appears that is where it makes service calls, but I don't know if it's supposed to only get triggered once or not
[19:02:39] <ir7466> If I set up a javascript array locally (ie. in the same file) then the autocomplete works as I expect
[19:02:47] <shoky> ir7466 it seems to already send a request for each char you put in
[19:03:33] <ir7466> shoky: thanks, I thought that's what it should be doing. I've got a breakpoint in my service call (in the php function) and I know it's not hitting it more than once
[19:03:41] <ir7466> I was wondering if it's trying to cache it or something
[19:04:39] <shoky> ir7466: http://jsfiddle.net/gU8hg/  it's sending a request for each key i press
[19:04:48] <shoky> well, each char i put in
[19:05:33] <ir7466> a request to /autocomplete/countries ?
[19:05:55] <shoky> yes
[19:06:05] <shoky> look in your browser's devtools network tab
[19:08:22] <shoky> maybe your breakpoint is the problem :P
[19:11:33] <ir7466> shoky: yes, thanks
[19:11:35] <ir7466> I can see that now
[19:11:42] <ir7466> however I am confused by something
[19:12:02] <ir7466> on my own page, I see: /?query=test
[19:12:09] <ir7466> instead of the actual service URL
[19:12:18] <ir7466> i don't know where "query" is coming from?
[19:12:29] <shoky> that's the name of the parameter it's sending to your php
[19:13:13] <shoky> there's a paramName option if you want to change it
[19:13:45] <ir7466> Ah okay... I have specified the service URL to be  '/app_dev.php/etc/etc', are you saying it's adding /?query=... to the end of that?
[19:14:21] <shoky> it's adding ?query=...  yes
[19:14:26] <ir7466> actually, strangely, if I copy the URL from the network area of the debugger... it doesn't show the /etc/etc/ page
[19:14:29] <shoky> that's how GET parameters work
[19:14:35] <ir7466> it shows the page I'm currently on
[19:14:49] <shoky> hm?
[19:15:10] <ir7466> ie. i'm currently on http://localhost/app_dev.php/shapes
[19:15:24] <ir7466> and the query is going to http://localhost/app_dev.php/shapes/?query=TEST
[19:15:46] <ir7466> even though for my serviceUrl I've specified the path as /app_dev.php/shapes/service/
[19:16:02] <shoky> are you sure
[19:16:06] <shoky> about the last 2 things
[19:16:59] <ir7466> yep, definitely pointing to a different service URL
[19:17:30] <shoky> need to see your code then
[19:17:49] <shoky> maybe a screenshot of your devtools ;p
[19:18:16] <ir7466> ok, one second
[19:20:02] <ir7466> here is the jquery code: http://pastebin.com/sak6ax44
[19:20:37] <ir7466> I can see that I have done something wrong... if I have that query parameter I guess I don't need to use str.replace to pump the value in
[19:20:49] <shoky> that snippet doesn't help much
[19:20:51] <ir7466> but that doesn't explain why it's hitting the wrong page... let me get the screenshot
[19:21:18] <shoky> are you sure it's passing the right serviceUrl ...
[19:21:25] <shoky> check that first
[19:22:49] <shoky> wait
[19:23:16] <ir7466> how do you mean? I can see in the source code that shapesService is pointing to where I expect it to
[19:23:18] <shoky> you're trying to insert the updated value from the input there into your shapesService string?
[19:23:36] <shoky> that's not gonna work, that's what the query parameter is for
[19:23:56] <shoky> it's already sent for you
[19:24:08] <ir7466> yep, I realise I made a mistake with that
[19:24:22] <ir7466> but i still don;'t understand why its pointing to the wrong address
[19:24:26] <ir7466> i'm uploading the screenshot
[19:25:01] <shoky> screenshot won't help. it's going to the address you gave it
[19:25:14] <shoky> (when it was initialized)
[19:25:23] <ir7466> http://postimg.org/image/rg7n55af3/
[19:26:05] <ir7466> so I just copied what you see in the address bar from the network debugger at the bottom
[19:26:06] <shoky> huh.. no idea what you wanna show with that
[19:26:15] <ir7466> I'd expect the address to be: /app_dev.php/shapes/service/...
[19:26:23] <ir7466> basically it's just adding /?query to the current page
[19:26:30] <ir7466> instead of to /shapes/service - the service URL
[19:26:36] <ir7466> sorry if I'm not making sense :(
[19:26:37] <shoky> it's going to the url you gave it when you initialized it
[19:26:54] <ir7466> not to serviceUrl?
[19:27:07] <shoky> to  the serviceUrl that you gave it when you initialized it
[19:27:28] <shoky> i.e. you gave it the wrong url
[19:27:54] <ir7466> when symfony parses that path, shapesService = '/app_dev.php/shapes/service/partial-shape';
[19:28:27] <ir7466> that's what I'm seeing in the source code. I realise that I don't need to do the string replace on partial-shape any more, now that I have the query parameter
[19:28:44] <ir7466> but still, wouldn't I expect to see /app_dev.php/shapes/service/partial-shape/?query=TEST
[19:30:11] <shoky> if what you said is true then yah
[19:31:05] <ir7466> okay shoky.... i'll have to go over all this with a fine tooth comb then. thank you very much for your help
[19:31:27] <ir7466> at least now I know that it *should* be making a call on each key press
[19:31:36] <ir7466> so I can work back from there. thanks :)
[19:31:44] <shoky> np
[19:31:50] <shoky> good luck
[19:34:30] <shoky> ir7466  shapesService/shapeService
[19:35:07] <wa5ted> i gues
[19:35:48] <ir7466> :( damn, you're right. the typo...
[19:35:49] <wa5ted> hi guys, i want to recreate this: http://dabblet.com/gist/5690173 <--    --> here is the fiddle I have started:http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/QDY8e/2/   <---can i get some help
[19:35:50] <ir7466> it works now
[19:35:53] <shoky> ;]
[19:36:12] <ir7466> like... works perfectly
[19:36:28] <shoky> sweet
[19:36:30] <wa5ted> hi guys, i want to recreate this: http://dabblet.com/gist/5690173 <--    --> here is the fiddle I have started: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/QDY8e/2/   <---can i get some help
[19:36:55] <ir7466> thanks for your help... it's better code now too, if I had chatted to you it would have taken me ages to figure out I don't need the string replace
[19:37:02] <ir7466> if I *hadn't* I mean
[19:37:02] <wa5ted> the resizing elments within the container is what i am triyng to recreate
[19:37:21] <shoky> no probs ir7466
[19:38:01] <wa5ted> shoky: got  a minute to look at my issue
[19:40:25] <shoky> in a bit
[19:40:36] <wa5ted> s;ureusre
[19:40:47] <wa5ted> shoky: ping me when you get a chance to look at it
[19:56:27] <wa5ted> shoky?
[19:59:12] <shoky> wa5ted: what's the issue
[19:59:27] <wa5ted> i want to recreate this: http://dabblet.com/gist/5690173 <-- --> here is the fiddle I have started: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/QDY8e/2/ <---can i get some help
[19:59:49] <wa5ted> recreate the resizing elements as you resize the window
[19:59:59] <wa5ted> im doing it with circles though
[20:00:27] <shoky> k
[20:01:58] <wa5ted> any chnace you can help me with writing it
[20:02:04] <wa5ted> i ma missing something major
[20:02:36] <wa5ted> shoky: i want to resize it but make sure that the text doesnt alter too much
[20:02:40] <wa5ted> yanno?
[20:03:37] <wa5ted> shoalso wanna stick with css and hmtl only if i can
[20:04:13] <shoky> not something i feel much like writing..
[20:09:55] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: Why aren't you just using the code from the demo you want to use?
[20:10:53] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: for some reason when I try to ex ract what I need it breaks and second I'd like to learn stuff from scratch such that should i need it in the future I know what to do from the group up
[20:11:04] <wa5ted> its a little pet peeve of mine
[20:13:15] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: for me i building from scratch gives me a sort of pride :P
[20:14:06] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: You have the animation on the wrong element in your fiddle. You want them on each project.
[20:14:42] <wa5ted> ahhhhh
[20:15:14] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: but i still have the issue of them being cramped weirdly
[20:16:28] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: That's just CSS.
[20:16:59] <wa5ted> okay
[20:17:32] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: did you see how when you resize in the dabble.com link the numbe rof items per line decreases and then if so the siz eof each elment increased
[20:17:37] <wa5ted> how would i ge tthat effect
[20:18:29] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: You'd use media queries for that, it would be like @media ( min-width: 500px ) { .project { width: 33%; } }
[20:18:40] <wa5ted> ahhh okay
[20:18:50] <wa5ted> add the padding ebtween elements?
[20:19:59] <BillCriswell> You would need to use margin with your structure.
[20:20:10] <wa5ted> margin: 20px on te .project
[20:20:10] <BillCriswell> I wouldn't be messing around with different display types here.
[20:20:21] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: That can work.
[20:20:33] <wa5ted> okay
[20:20:37] <BillCriswell> Just make sure when you're changing the width you leave room for the margins.
[20:20:46] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/QDY8e/5/
[20:20:54] <wa5ted> hmmmmmm
[20:21:23] <relipse> how can i use jquery to grab the td above it, to the left, to the right and below it
[20:21:39] <relipse> in any given location
[20:21:55] <Velveeta> wat
[20:22:06] <BillCriswell> relipse: Are you starting on a cell?
[20:22:15] <relipse> imagine a grid system, i have a TD somewhere on the center
[20:22:23] <relipse> i need to find the td next to it, and above and below
[20:22:29] <relipse> yes i know the cell
[20:22:51] <Velveeta> you can use the td's .index() value to grab the left and right siblings
[20:23:10] <Velveeta> and its and its row's indexes to grab the top and bottom neighbors
[20:23:18] <relipse> how though
[20:23:23] <wa5ted> Velveeta: yeah! :P your here
[20:23:28] <BillCriswell> I imagine you could use some math to get the one above and below as well
[20:23:38] <Velveeta> yep, but i have no interest in working on that css issue this late at night :)
[20:23:47] <BillCriswell> If you know how many rows and columns.
[20:25:38] <Velveeta> relipse: given your td, var left = $(this).prev(), right = $(this).next(), top = $(this).parent().prev().children(':eq(' + $(this).index() + ')'), bottom = $(this).parent().next().children(':eq(' + $(this).index() + ')');
[20:25:41] <Velveeta> something like that
[20:25:55] <relipse> niiice
[20:25:58] <relipse> thanks velveeta
[20:26:00] <relipse> cheese
[20:26:03] <Velveeta> you'll want to cache some of that crap off into variables to avoid reinitializing that jquery object, requerying for the index, etc
[20:26:59] <Velveeta> i see bill's been pulling from his private repo of everything-that's-already-done
[20:27:09] <wa5ted> Velveeta: :(
[20:27:14] <wa5ted> come on bro
[20:27:24] <wa5ted> when have you ever backed down form a chalenge
[20:27:24] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha.
[20:27:30] <Velveeta> plenty of times :D
[20:27:42] <Velveeta> it's 10:30 here, and bill's already given you a satisfactory solution
[20:28:08] <wa5ted> lol true
[20:28:09] <Velveeta> besides, you can't very well use the excuse that "i like to build it from scratch for the learning process" if you just bounce from one person to the next asking them to write your stuff for you
[20:28:14] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://jsbin.com/kuxapika/1/edit?html,js,output This is what I was thinking with the grid, but getting the left and right ( using eq ) is less fun because it might move to the next row.
[20:30:06] <Velveeta> bill: added left and right to it
[20:30:41] <BillCriswell> /2/ ?
[20:30:51] <Velveeta> annnnnnnd a color reset: http://jsbin.com/kuxapika/3/edit
[20:30:52] <BillCriswell> Oh. lol
[20:30:58] <BillCriswell> But I wanted to use index() =(
[20:31:03] <BillCriswell> Er, .eq()
[20:31:23] <Velveeta> well, you know what they said... want in one hand...........
[20:31:31] <Velveeta> say*
[20:31:47] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I used that expression with my girlfriend, literally got pissed at me. told me to speak english.
[20:31:58] <Velveeta> lol
[20:32:16] <Velveeta> i don't quite understand how that expression doesn't sound english :D
[20:32:50] <BillCriswell> She doesn't like metaphors.
[20:33:00] <BillCriswell> "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush", "Shut up, Bill"
[20:33:28] <xniz> hello Velveeta  :)
[20:33:34] <Velveeta> i like to say "killing a bird with 2 stones", because my brother said it once, and after i stopped laughing, i started using it sarcastically
[20:33:43] <Velveeta> xniz: hello  hello
[20:33:53] <xniz> how are you tonight ? :)
[20:34:25] <Velveeta> tired, about to make a lunch for tomorrow and get to bed only somewhat later than i'd like
[20:34:29] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: In Trailer Park Boys the one guy says "get two birds stoned at once"
[20:34:42] <Velveeta> normally it's 12-1am, so 11pm is almost a respectable time
[20:34:47] <xniz> Velveeta,  ahh :D. i havent gotten much done myself
[20:34:51] <xniz> and its a bit late
[20:34:57] <xniz> need to sleep myself but bleh
[20:35:04] <Velveeta> bill: i've never watched that show, but seen plenty of rickyisms on youtube :D
[20:35:35] <BillCriswell> I've watched it.. way too much.
[20:36:03] <xniz> i believe i seen all of trailor park boys
[20:36:05] <xniz> hilarious
[20:36:36] <BillCriswell> New seasons soon. Should be awesome.
[20:37:07] <Velveeta> i'm waiting for s2 of orange is the new black
[20:37:13] <xniz> :o
[20:37:20] <Velveeta> and now i'm waiting for the next season of archer.. again
[20:37:25] <xniz> im fond of the new series "the 100"
[20:37:41] <Velveeta> and i'm in limbo on revolution and walking dead
[20:37:48] <Velveeta> but at least game of thrones is back
[20:37:52] <BillCriswell> I loved the Bob's Burgers / History Of Violence / Archer cross-over
[20:38:11] <Velveeta> that sounds vaguely familiar, and yet i can't place it
[20:38:38] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/QDY8e/7/ <-- gotten that far, is there any way by which if i have an odd number of elements that last element will slide to the left hand side
[20:38:51] <Velveeta> holy crap, i wasn't aware of this crossover, thanks youtube
[20:39:25] <Velveeta> wa5ted: text-align: center should be left instead
[20:39:29] <xniz> http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/ <-- is about as far as ive gotten. my brain is going blank on ideas atm
[20:40:15] <xniz> so far the animations and positioning seem to be good on all browsers except the default android browser
[20:40:30] <xniz> idk why its thinking i have a bigger resolution then what i do
[20:40:37] <xniz> but Firefox Mobile it looks fine
[20:42:42] <wa5ted> Velveeta: the problem with doing left is now the itmes are cnetered in the page
[20:42:44] <xniz> id like to try and make a slideable thumbnail bar
[20:42:58] <xniz> or some way to scroll through more than just 5 thumbnails
[20:43:03] <wa5ted> because i need some margin on either side i suspect i could add margin auto to the container
[20:43:26] <wa5ted> but i havent specified a width and dont want to so im at a dead end
[21:11:26] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://jsbin.com/kuxapika/4/edit thinking just traversing is easier at this point.
[21:12:12] <BillCriswell> Assuming I'm not doing something stupid math wise.
[21:33:50] <tdubya> Alright guys, so I have this bit of jQuery to center a div. http://jsfiddle.net/63AZE/ and the final $(window).resize(); wont fire until i actually resize the window. I know giving the div fixed dimensions will fix this but the content of the div is dynamically generated so I'd like another solution if one exists.
[21:35:10] <ir7466> http://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/release/  -- I'm reading this document, but I don't understand what it means about "less"?
[21:35:31] <zylophone> how do i bubble up in the dom tree to find a specific parent with a known selector?
[21:35:44] <ir7466> I have included in my project the js and css file that was included in the download, obviously it's not working - the only thing I can think of is that it's this "less" thing?
[21:35:47] <iDevelop> tdubya: http://jsfiddle.net/63AZE/1/
[21:35:53] <zylophone> i thought it was .parents('#foo') but that doesn't appear to be it
[21:36:20] <tdubya> ir7466 less is a precompiler that compiles to css
[21:36:28] <tdubya> similar to sass
[21:36:40] <iDevelop> tdubya: did you look?
[21:36:48] <tdubya> about to
[21:36:49] <ir7466> is there any reason I can't just use the .css file that was included in the download?
[21:36:58] <ir7466> how do I know if less compiles a different css to what was included?
[21:37:44] <tdubya> iDevelop, awesome, thanks. what exactly is going on?
[21:37:59] <iDevelop> tdubya: update; removed something that wasn't needed: http://jsfiddle.net/63AZE/2/
[21:38:26] <tdubya> that actually unfixed it
[21:38:41] <iDevelop> lol
[21:39:24] <iDevelop> http://jsfiddle.net/63AZE/3/
[21:39:26] <iDevelop> yolo then
[21:39:36] <zylophone> huzah!
[21:39:51] <iDevelop> All I did was throw it into a function and call it when the doc was ready, and upon resize
[21:40:04] <iDevelop> I love functions
[21:40:31] <tdubya> trying to see what you did here.
[21:40:34] <zylophone> ahh the fabled vertical and horz centre alignment
[21:40:42] <tdubya> css is a mess dude
[21:41:03] <zylophone> unless you've worked with drupal, you have no idea about messy css
[21:41:13] <zylophone> and messy js come to that
[21:41:26] <tdubya> ir7466 you should be able to use the included .css - the less is just nice because it has variables that you can use to make writing your css more efficient
[21:41:41] <tdubya> among other things
[21:42:28] <ir7466> Please forgive me... I haven't used jsfiddle before so I'm not sure if I'm doing it right... http://jsfiddle.net/9qeVN/
[21:42:39] <ir7466> see on the bottom right, how there's a textbox with a calendar button?
[21:42:46] <ir7466> if you click the calendar button, nothing happens
[21:43:03] <ir7466> the same thing is happening in my project - click it and nothing happens
[21:43:34] <iDevelop> tdubya: did I finally do something right? Did my amazing code help?
[21:43:45] <tdubya> yeah dude, it definitely helped. thanks
[21:43:45] <ir7466> I'm more of a pastebin person :)
[21:44:18] <iDevelop> I'm more of a {you'll never get my code} person
[21:45:01] <zylophone> i.e. a single dev :p
[21:45:24] <tdubya> hey iDevelop, what's the deal with 'centre' working but 'center' not working?
[21:45:48] <zylophone> reserved keyword?
[21:45:49] <ir7466> it's a sign that England > America
[21:45:52] <ir7466> ;)
[21:45:55] <zylophone> haha
[21:45:59] <iDevelop> uuh, no idea at all... maybe UK-developed code only works with UK spelling
[21:46:12] <zylophone> i wish that were true
[21:46:27] <zylophone> don't canadians spell it properly?
[21:46:42] <tdubya> i was going to give you shit about your english spelling but then i saw the code didnt work when i spelled it the proper, 'murican way
[21:46:44] <zylophone> i'd imagine india does too, so too australia and new zealand
[21:47:03] <ir7466> basically any country that plays cricket spells it properly
[21:47:12] <zylophone> tdubya: "proper"?
[21:47:27] <zylophone> ir7466: pretty much yeah
[21:47:43] <tdubya> ir7466 i actually used that date picker in a project, let me see what the source looks like
[21:47:53] <Uhkis> en_US ftw! (except for "soccer")
[21:47:53] <ir7466> tdubya: thanks
[21:48:09] <tdubya> you'll also have to include it in the fiddle through a cdn or something to get anything to work
[21:48:21] <ir7466> I included it in external resources?
[21:48:51] <tdubya> oh kk
[21:50:11] <tdubya> you also need to include the .js
[21:52:09] <ir7466> i did didn't I?
[21:52:14] <ir7466> oh
[21:52:18] <ir7466> oops
[21:52:56] <ir7466> added it: http://jsfiddle.net/9qeVN/
[21:52:59] <ir7466> still nothing
[21:55:34] <tdubya> you still need more resources
[21:55:35] <tdubya> http://jsfiddle.net/9qeVN/1/
[21:55:37] <ir7466> sorry
[21:55:38] <ir7466> http://jsfiddle.net/9qeVN/2/
[21:55:41] <ir7466> ah
[21:55:55] <tdubya> i pasted the code from the project where i used it
[21:56:00] <tdubya> gonna try to get it to work from there
[21:56:22] <ir7466> oh ok, thanks
[21:56:46] <tdubya> i know you can either get it fire through js or through data-attributes. i think i used data attributes
[21:57:25] <ir7466> i'd just be happy if it gets to the point where I see a date picker
[21:58:58] <ir7466> I don't know if it helps, but in my firefox debugger it says "Empty string passed to getElementById()." whenever I click the calendar icon
[21:59:11] <tdubya> i can't remember for the life of me what i did
[22:02:35] <tdubya> http://eternicode.github.io/bootstrap-datepicker/?markup=input&format=&weekStart=&startDate=&endDate=&startView=0&minViewMode=0&todayBtn=false&language=en&orientation=auto&multidate=&multidateSeparator=&keyboardNavigation=on&forceParse=on#sandbox
[22:02:43] <tdubya> good lord that was a long link
[22:03:17] <ir7466> yeah I was using that page as a guide
[22:03:29] <tdubya> ir7466 your best bet is to check out the source from there. i think that's what i did. i cant remember but i need sleep. don't worry, you'll get it. sorry i couldnt help :(
[22:04:06] <ir7466> haha, okay so it worked
[22:04:07] <ir7466> sort of
[22:04:17] <ir7466> $('#test1 input').datepicker({});
[22:04:21] <ir7466> i did that and it worked
[22:04:34] <ir7466> but i'm trying to get it to work when you click the calendar
[22:04:37] <ir7466> not when you click the box
[22:04:54] <tdubya> oh, in my usage i had it fire when you clicked the form
[22:05:17] <ir7466> what does: $('#sandbox-container .input-group.date').datepicker({          mean?
[22:05:25] <ir7466> I don't understand the .input-group.date bit?
[22:06:55] <ir7466> as you saw from the earlier jsfiddle, I had:  <div id="test1" class="input-group date">    <input type="text" class="form-control"><span class="input-group-addon"><i>{{ icon('calendar') }}</i></span>   </div>
[22:07:11] <ir7466> so I figure .input-group.date relates to my div somehow?
[22:07:16] <tdubya> yeah
[22:07:29] <ir7466> should there be a space in .input-group.date ?
[22:07:36] <tdubya> im a terrible coder but that bit you pasted basically means this
[22:08:37] <jamesd> # are id's,  . is a class the second dot points to the input object, i forget the exact meaning of the . in that case... google  css selector tutorial...
[22:08:56] <tdubya> actually yeah ^ he said it better
[22:09:43] <jamesd> untill i understood, selectors, jquery just seemed to be trial and error untill i found something that worked
[22:09:59] <tandroid> the second selector .input-group.date is just being more specific
[22:10:07] <ir7466> so $('#test1 .input-group .date').datepicker({});   means that the date picker should be applied to anything in id "test1" where the class is "input-group" and "date" ?
[22:10:08] <tandroid> it could just as easily be .date or .input-group
[22:10:23] <tandroid> ir7466 no
[22:10:42] <tandroid> that would mean that .date would have to be a child of .input-group
[22:11:02] <tandroid> .input-group.date is a way of saying "I want the element with both of those classes
[22:11:21] <ir7466> http://jsfiddle.net/9qeVN/3/
[22:11:42] <ir7466> tandroid: if that's the case, why wouldn't just "$('#test1 .input-group')" work as you say?
[22:12:11] <tandroid> ir7466, what is #test?
[22:12:20] <tandroid> I mean #test1
[22:12:25] <ir7466> the id for the div
[22:13:05] <tandroid> That div doesn't exist in your code
[22:13:17] <ir7466> <div id="test1" class="input-group date">   ?
[22:13:47] <tandroid> Oh, I didn't scroll down sorry
[22:14:16] <tandroid> So the first one wont work and the second will
[22:14:21] <ir7466> yeah
[22:14:29] <xniz> mwahaha this is sweet :D
[22:14:31] <ir7466> well... it doesn't appear to work in the jsfiddle
[22:14:37] <ir7466> but I got the first one working in my project
[22:14:42] <tandroid> Oh wait....
[22:14:50] <xniz> just made a nifty slider for my thumbnails
[22:14:57] <tandroid> Yeah
[22:16:56] <tandroid> ir7466 http://jsfiddle.net/9qeVN/4/
[22:17:33] <ir7466> that doesn't work for my tandroid
[22:17:34] <ir7466> however
[22:17:44] <tandroid> Okay, but the selector is right
[22:17:52] <tandroid> but...
[22:17:52] <ir7466> in my project code I used: $('#test1').datepicker({}) and it worked
[22:17:54] <ir7466> just then
[22:18:06] <tandroid> Yeah so it's because you're selecting a class
[22:18:19] <tandroid> I think...
[22:19:03] <tandroid> ir7466, what is this even supposed to do.
[22:19:04] <tandroid> ?
[22:20:34] <tandroid> ir7466, How do I tell if it's working?
[22:20:34] <ir7466> just a simple date picker
[22:20:38] <ir7466> it should show a calendar
[22:20:49] <ir7466> See: http://eternicode.github.io/bootstrap-datepicker/?markup=component&format=&weekStart=&startDate=&endDate=&startView=0&minViewMode=0&todayBtn=false&language=en&orientation=auto&multidate=&multidateSeparator=&keyboardNavigation=on&forceParse=on#sandbox
[22:21:05] <ir7466> tandroid: it's working in my project now though
[22:21:25] <ir7466> i've got no idea why the jsfiddle is broken, but it's working in my project which is the main thing :)
[22:21:43] <tandroid> ir7466: Yeah that's what matters I guess. The problem I think was that you were using a class.
[22:22:22] <tandroid> ir7466, if you select elements based on a class in jquery it will return an array of objects even if there is only one
[22:22:36] <ir7466> oh, ok
[22:22:45] <ir7466> so generally speaking, its best to use #ids ?
[22:22:53] <tandroid> so if you know there is only one, you could use $('.someclass')[0].doSomething();
[22:23:22] <Uhkis> ir7466: ids = unique, classes = multiple
[22:23:22] <tandroid> ir7466, When you are only selecting one element and you know which one it will be, I would say yes, use an id
[22:23:27] <zylophone> or better yet, use an id
[22:23:33] <zylophone> snap!
[22:24:35] <tandroid> crackle
[22:24:41] <Uhkis> pop
[22:24:44] <tandroid> yes!
[22:24:54] <zylophone> i loved those as a kid
[22:25:02] <tandroid> They were the best
[22:25:08] <tandroid> or one of the best
[22:25:23] <zylophone> infact, i may go buy some today
[22:25:37] <ir7466> okay, thanks for the tips guys :)
[22:25:37] <tandroid> I may go buy some tomorrow
[22:25:48] <tandroid> ir7466: no problem!
[22:25:49] <zylophone> well fu. i bought some yesterday!
[22:26:17] <tandroid> oh....
[22:27:11] <tandroid> Even if I left now I couldn't get them today
[22:27:22] <tandroid> it's 3 minutes from being tomorrow
[22:27:38] <zylophone> heh
[22:27:45] <tandroid> Ohhhhh well
[22:28:17] <zylophone> i hated frosties
[22:28:21] <zylophone> soo much sugar on them
[22:28:28] <zylophone> they made me hyper for the day
[22:28:32] <tandroid> I was always a fan
[22:28:46] <zylophone> let me guess, you thought they were grrreeeeat
[22:28:51] <tandroid> ha
[22:29:01] <zylophone> had to get it in before you did!
[22:29:20] <tandroid> You beat me to the puch
[22:29:23] <tandroid> *punch
[22:29:29] <tandroid> Fruit punch
[22:29:30] <zylophone> the early bird
[22:29:43] <tandroid> Which I was a fan of as well
[22:29:52] <zylophone> ?
[22:30:15] <zylophone> fruit pastels
[22:30:17] <tandroid> fruit punch
[22:30:19] <tandroid> no
[22:30:36] <zylophone>  /me punches tandroid
[22:30:40] <zylophone> APPLES
[22:30:45] <tandroid> Is that an America only thing?
[22:30:56] <zylophone> yeah pretty much
[22:31:03] <tandroid> I see
[22:31:06] <zylophone> it was invented so jocks could spike it
[22:31:09] <tandroid> You're all missing out
[22:31:30] <zylophone> we're quite content and too busy speaking proper english
[22:31:32] <tandroid> And for an excuse to crash through walls
[22:32:13] <xniz> http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/ <--- :D if you click on the logo you will see the slider animation
[22:32:37] <xniz> however, I am having some problems with the window maximization and some conditional statements that are out of work when you are at the last offset and you maximize/minimize
[22:32:46] <zylophone> and have your ip logged as you're forwarded to some dirty site
[22:34:04] <xniz> man i dont know how to fix this problem ugh
[22:35:56] <zylophone> jsfiddle.net
[22:36:10] <wa5ted> zylophone: could i get some help
[22:36:31] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/QDY8e/7/
[22:36:36] <wa5ted> i cant get this to work properly
[22:36:45] <wa5ted> intended behaviour is this
[22:36:52] <wa5ted> but  i dont want a dependancy on the font size
[22:37:02] <wa5ted> i want to manually set the width and height of the circle itself
[22:37:04] <wa5ted> http://dabblet.com/gist/5690173
[22:37:06] <wa5ted> usign media quesies
[22:37:45] <wa5ted> zylophone: any ideas
[22:37:48] <zylophone> where's the js?
[22:38:39] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/QDY8e/8/
[22:38:44] <wa5ted> there is none
[22:38:46] <wa5ted> its css only
[22:38:49] <wa5ted> thats the trick
[22:38:55] <wa5ted> zylophone: ^
[22:38:59] <zylophone> the play's the thing

[22:40:06] <zylophone> i'm english, forgive me
[22:40:14] <zylophone> conscience
[22:40:17] <wa5ted> zylophone: you are forgiven
[22:40:25] <wa5ted> can you help
[22:40:27] <wa5ted> me
[22:41:06] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/QDY8e/9/
[22:44:23] <zylophone> wa5ted: doesn't it depend on the intial page size and not the later resizing?
[22:44:40] <wa5ted> it depends on both
[22:44:46] <wa5ted> at least i think so
[22:45:11] <wa5ted> is there anyway i can center the items within the container that is 100% width
[22:45:31] <zylophone> margin:auto;
[22:46:33] <wa5ted> on the container
[22:46:35] <wa5ted> or the items
[22:57:47] <zylophone> is .live to be avoided?
[22:58:09] <zylophone> mhh, i see it's deprecated so i guess so!
[23:01:39] <Cork> zylophone: not just deprecated, it is removed from 1.9+
[23:13:25] <zylophone> uhm, how do you do an .on for a hover in and hover out?
[23:13:42] <Cork> you don't
[23:13:59] <Cork> you either use the combination function .hover
[23:14:12] <Cork> or .on('mouseover').on('mouseout')
[23:14:18] <zylophone> ah
[23:14:34] <zylophone> thanks
[23:14:42] <Cork> np
[23:19:28] <zylophone> uhm, am i right in assuming that .on replaces .live for dynamic elements that need event listeners?
[23:19:38] <wa5ted> Cork: is there any way to evenly distrubute items in a div
[23:19:44] <wa5ted> for multiple lines
[23:19:56] <zylophone> use a % width
[23:20:06] <Cork> wa5ted: only way is to make them the same size
[23:20:14] <Cork> if you mean through css
[23:20:32] <wa5ted> let me show yo my current issue
[23:21:51] <wa5ted> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/9KUJ3/1/ <--- resize the preview window
[23:22:05] <wa5ted> and wait until there are 3 items per row
[23:22:18] <wa5ted> is there anyways to get that last row to left align
[23:22:34] <wa5ted> like a lef tjustify
[23:24:33] <Cork> wa5ted: you could try using flex
[23:24:47] <Cork> though it is a big new so ie has problem with it
[23:24:59] <wa5ted> ie 9+ included
[23:25:07] <wa5ted> i dont give a shit about 8 and below
[23:25:19] <wa5ted> cause people coming to my site are not using that shit
[23:25:21] <wa5ted> and if they do
[23:25:22] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex#Browser_compatibility
[23:25:28] <wa5ted> ill make sure they get turned back
[23:25:49] <wa5ted> does flex allow multiline
[23:25:58] <wa5ted> multiple rows
[23:26:06] <Cork> yes, but that is even more limited
[23:26:19] <Cork> there is ways around that though
[23:26:45] <wa5ted> okay
[23:26:47] <wa5ted> found somehting
[23:26:56] <wa5ted> http://codepen.io/airen/pen/ovAtz
[23:27:01] <wa5ted> could probably tune it to my use
[23:27:47] <wa5ted> Cork: can you explain one thing from that fiddle
[23:27:53] <wa5ted> why di they use a 0.1px font size
[23:28:02] <wa5ted> what sort of white space are they tring to hide
[23:28:05] <Cork> wa5ted: that one doesn't scale the elements though
[23:28:17] <wa5ted> true
[23:28:27] <wa5ted> but scalling will work with media queries no?
[23:28:27] <Cork> wa5ted: text-align: justify
[23:28:35] <Cork> they adjust the space between the elements
[23:28:35] <wa5ted> i tried tat
[23:28:38] <wa5ted> thats what i have
[23:28:41] <wa5ted> and its not working
[23:28:43] <Cork> and lets text-align handle the spacing
[23:28:48] <wa5ted> i want it to work for odd cases as well
[23:29:02] <wa5ted> henc ewhy when i have 3 items to a row
[23:29:09] <wa5ted> the last 2 are justified and look shit
[23:30:19] <Cork> wa5ted: well justify works
[23:30:23] <Cork> and it works in your example
[23:30:28] <wa5ted> true
[23:30:33] <Cork> until the element it self it too wide
[23:30:40] <wa5ted> true
[23:30:42] <wa5ted> okay
[23:30:44] <wa5ted> thanks
[23:31:23] <wa5ted> Cork: one last thing, in that example is it specific to the ul-li structure or will it work on a div structure
[23:33:15] <Cork> wa5ted: the spacing thing works on any inline elements
[23:33:25] <Cork> wa5ted: so normal divs no
[23:33:37] <wa5ted> okay
[23:33:37] <Cork> divs with display: inline or display: inline-block; yes
[23:34:04] <Cork> wa5ted: the best you can do with older css is http://jsfiddle.net/9KUJ3/2/
[23:34:18] <Cork> the problem is having the height adjust to be the same as width
[23:34:40] <wa5ted> and then use media queries i gues to balance out the height and width
[23:34:48] <wa5ted> yeah that is a problem
[23:35:53] <wa5ted> Cork:  i got it
[23:35:58] <wa5ted> i inlined blocked the divs
[23:36:01] <wa5ted> thanks :)
